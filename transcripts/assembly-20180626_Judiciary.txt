FORTY THOUSAND AT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA FIRST RESPONDERS TO PROVIDE FOR STATE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS.

I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT ALL AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF.

EIGHT NINETEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HINDER COLLEAGUES I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE AND FOR HIGHLIGHTING. A CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS ON PAGE TWELVE OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WE'RE ACCEPTING TODAY. S. B. EIGHT NINETEEN INSURERS CALIFORNIA'S RATE PAYERS DON'T PAY FOR UTILITIES NEGLIGENT BEHAVIOR. THIS BILL ACHIEVES THIS SIMPLY BY CODIFYING EXISTING P. UC PRACTICE MANDATING THAT FINES PENALTIES ARE EXPENSES RESULTING FROM UNREASONABLE BEHAVIOR ARE NOT RECOVERABLE IN RATES. WHO PAYS FOR DAMAGES SHOULD BE BASED ON A UTILITIES CONDUCT? THE P. UC DETERMINES UTILITIES ACTED REALLY REASONABLY RATEPAYERS WILL COVER THE COST. BUT IF THE P. UC DETERMINES UTILITY ACTED UNREASONABLY OR IMPRUDENTLY RATEPAYERS SHOULD NOT PAY. THIS IS A CENTRAL AND FUNDAMENTAL PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S RATE PAYERS SB EIGHT NINETEEN ALSO ENSURES THAT FOR APPLICATIONS WHERE A UTILITY WAS REASONABLE IN PART. THEN THE PEW SEE MAY AUTHORIZE RECOVERY FOR THAT PART. THIS IS BEEN TRUE FOR OTHER COST APPLICATIONS IN THE PAST WHERE THE P. UC ALLOWED SOME EXPENSES PUT DISALLOWED OTHERS. THIS BILL CLARIFIES THE P. UC'S AUTHORITY TO APPROACH A PORTION COSTS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ALLOCATE NINETEEN IS A FUNDAMENTAL RATE PAYER PROTECTION MEASURE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL.

IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE ANYTIME ANYWHERE AND AT ANY AGE. THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION DURING SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST IS THE USE OF AN AUTOMATED. EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE TOOK SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND HELP SAVE LIVES. SB THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN BILLS OFF THE SUCCESS OF EXISTING A E. D.

TWELVE FORTY NINE WELCOME SP TWELVE FORTY NINE YES. THANK YOU MET MISTER CHAIR I MEMBERS SP TWELVE FORTY NINE PROHIBITS THE SALE OR PROMOTIONAL GIVEAWAY OF ANY COSMETIC PRODUCT IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS BEEN TESTED. ON ANIMALS AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS THAT I WILL OUTLINE SHORTLY. AS YOU MAY KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG HISTORY OVER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF PROHIBITING ANIMAL TESTING FOR COSMETIC PRODUCTS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST STATE TO BAN THE PRACTICE OF USING ANIMALS FOR TESTING COSMETICS. HOWEVER THE LOS STAYED SILENT ABOUT THEIR IMPORTATION AND SALE. JUST FOUR YEARS AGO THE SENATE UNANIMOUSLY AND THE ASSEMBLY PASSED SJR TWENTY TWO BY SENATOR BLOCK URGING CONGRESS TO PASS THE HUMANE COSMETICS ACT THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THE SALE OF COSMETICS. TESTED ON ANIMALS NATIONWIDE PARALLEL TO S. B. TWELVE FORTY NINE BEFORE YOU TODAY. SJR TWENTY TWO WE SEE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE VOTING IN FAVOR OF IT. EVEN WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY COSMETIC COMPANIES IN SUPPORT OF CONGRESSIONAL ACTION CONGRESS HAS NOT ACTED. SO TODAY I'M ASKING THIS COMMITTEE TO DO WHAT WE HAVE NORMALLY DONE WHEN CONGRESS DOES NOT ACT AND THAT IS FOR CALIFORNIA TO MOVE FORWARD AND LEAD. WHILE IT MAY SEEM THAT CALIFORNIA IS ON THE LEADING EDGE IN FACT WE'RE ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF THIRTY FIVE OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THAT HAVE ALREADY BANNED THE SALE OF COSMETIC PRODUCTS TESTED ON ANIMALS. COUNTRIES AS DIVERSE AS BULGARIA INDIA ISRAEL THE EUROPEAN UNION AND EVEN THE TINY ISLAND OF MALTA ALL BANNED THE SALE OF COSMETICS TESTED ON ANIMALS. SP TWELVE FORTY NINE SIMPLY BRINGS CALIFORNIA'S HUMANE STANDARDS AND LINE WITH THE WORLD'S HIGHEST. MY OFFICE HAS WORKED WITH CERTAIN COSMETIC INDUSTRY OPPOSITION AND WE HAVE TAKEN MANY SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS AND WE'VE ALSO WORKED WITH THE MANY MANY COMPANIES WHO SELL CRUELTY FREE COSMETICS AND THE STATE. AND COUNTRY AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN S. B. TWELVE FORTY NINE ALLOWS TWO EXCEPTIONS TO THE BAN WERE ANIMAL TESTED COSMETICS WOULD STILL BE ALLOWED. ANY THIRD EXEMPTION IS BEING PROPOSED I MEAN ALICE'S. THE FIRST EXEMPTION IS IN THE EVENT THAT THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION OR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL REQUIRES TESTING AND THERE'S NO ALTERNATIVE AVAILABLE. THE SECOND EXEMPTION ALLOWS ANIMAL TESTING TO COMPLY WITH A FORMAL REQUEST OF A FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITY. THIS EXEMPTION WILL SUNSET AS OF JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THREE AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CAN WITH GREAT CONFIDENCE KNOW THAT THE COSMETIC PRODUCTS THAT THEY PURCHASE ARE NO LONGER PRODUCED. THROUGH UNNECESSARY PAINFUL AND VERY AWFUL AND FULLY AVOIDABLE ANIMAL TESTS THE THIRD EXEMPTION ADDRESSES CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT ANIMAL TESTING CONDUCTED FOR A NON COSMETIC PURPOSE. SUCH TESTING WHAT HAVE TO BE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL STATE OR FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITY. THE COSMETIC COMPONENT HAD. ACTUALLY BE ANNA COSMETIC FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR AND THE TESTING WAS NOT CONDUCTED BY ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COSMETIC MANUFACTURERS. THIS WILL HELP PREVENT SITUATIONS WHERE CHEMICALS ARE ONE DAY TESTED FOR NON COSMETIC PURPOSES FOR ANY REASON AND THEN THE VERY NEXT DAY THAT SAME CHEMICAL JUST SO HAPPENS TO NOW BE CONSIDERED. A COSMETIC COMPONENT. LET'S NOT FORGET SP TWELVE FORTY NINE GRANDFATHER'S END THOUSANDS OF CURRENT COSMETIC INGREDIENTS MANY TESTED ON ANIMALS UP UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME TODAY OUR REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BILL'S SPONSOR. THANK YOU AND THERE ARE SOME. AMENDMENTS THAT ARE PRESENTED IN A MOCK UP JUST A CLEAR YOU'RE TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS GREAT THANK THE WORLD ON THE SAME PAGE. RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR -- FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GO AHEAD HILLARY AND GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS HILARY PICKLES AND I AM HERE TODAY REPRESENTING A LUSH COSMETICS INCORPORATED ARE UNITED STATES RETAIL BUSINESS. UNLESS HANDMADE COSMETICS LIMITED OUR CANADIAN RETAIL AND MANUFACTURING BUSINESSES AND LUSCIOUS HAPPY TO SUPPORT SP. TWELVE FORTY NINE MANUFACTURING AND SELLING CRUELTY FREE COSMETICS AND TRANSPARENCY INTO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN HAVE BEEN CORE VALUES SINCE THE INCEPTION OF LUSH IN NORTH AMERICA MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND THOSE VALUES HAVE ALLOWED US TO GROW OUR BUSINESS EXPONENTIALLY OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES WE NOW HAVE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED STORES IN NORTH AMERICA FORTY OF WHICH ARE DOING GREAT BUSINESS YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. AND FIFTY THAT ARE LOCATED IN CANADA. LAST YEAR WE SAW MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE COME INTO OUR NORTH AMERICANSHOPS OVER THIRTY FOUR MILLION UNIQUE VISITORS TO OUR WEBSITE AND OVER SIX POINT FIVE MILLION. FOLLOWERS ACROSS OUR SEVEN SOCIAL MEET SO WITH THIS GROWING TREND ON THE CONSUMER MARKET AND THE DEMAND BY THE CONSUMERS FOR CRUELTY FREE COSMETICS. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT CREATING CRUELTY FREE PRODUCTS HAS CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO OUR GROWTH AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. AND WE ARE NOT ALONE THERE ARE MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED COSMETICS BRANDS IN NORTH AMERICA THAT ARE CERTIFIED AS CRUELTY FREE. AT LUNCH WE WROTE OUR COMPANY NON ANIMAL TESTING POLICY TO EXCLUDE SUPPLIERS NOT JUST TESTING ON ANIMALS FOR COSMETIC PURPOSES BUT TESTING FOR ANY PURPOSE. OUR POLICY ALSO EXCLUDES THE TESTING OF ANIMALS CARRIED OUT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD JUST TO ELIMINATE THE THE DANGER OF OFFSHORE TESTING. THE THING IS WE DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY HERE. WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES DO WE WANT TO BE A SOCIETY WHO DECIDES TO HARM ANIMALS FOR THE POTENTIAL USE OF AN INGREDIENT IN A COSMETIC. OR DO WE WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR INVESTING IN ALTERNATES. AND WORKING WITH REGULATORS AND NOT BEING HUMANS WHO HARM NON HUMAN ANIMALS FOR THE STATE OF COSMETICS. LAST WEEK IN CANADA A HUGE TRADE PARTNER FOR THE U. S. THE FEDERAL BILL AS TO FOURTEEN WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT DOMESTIC ANIMAL TESTING FOR COSMETICS AS WELL AS THE SALE OF COSMETICS THAT HAVE UNDERGONE ANY FORM OF NEW TESTING. JUST UNANIMOUSLY PASSED THE SENATE. IN CLOSING THE NEARLY FORTY COUNTRIES WHO HAVE BANNED TESTING ON ANIMALS FOR COSMETIC PURPOSES. ARE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION AND THE PUBLIC IN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE LASH CAN APPLY PRESSURE BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT GOVERNMENT PROVIDE THE PACE. IT IT'S TIME TO AYE CALIFORNIA TO THAT LIST AND PASSED THE CALIFORNIA CRUELTY FREE COSMETICS ACT THINK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE.

JANE VELEZ MITCHELL JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR FROM MARINA DEL REY LET'S INVOLVED IT'S THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THANK YOU. IF YOU ANYONE ELSE SINCE PORT. THE NUNS ARE OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SETH CHO CON ALL. I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH COVINGTON AND BURLING IN WASHINGTON DC IMPARTED TRAINING COVINGTON I WORKED A FEW HASSOUN DRUG ADMINISTRATION AS ASSISTANT CHIEF COUNSEL THERE. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION S. B.. TWELVE FORTY NINE IN CALIFORNIA THE PERSONAL CARE INDUSTRY EMPLOYS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND RESIDENTS. AND CONTRIBUTES TWENTY I'M GOING TO THE STATE'S GDP AND SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION IN TAX REVENUE ANNUALLY. THIS BILL WOULD DRAMATICALLY IMPACT THIS CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY. AT THE OUTSET. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS INDUSTRIES BEEN THE LEADER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANIMAL TESTING ALTERNATIVES FOR DECADES. NEARLY FORTY YEARS AGO INDUSTRY FUNDED THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL TESTING. OR VALUABLE RESEARCH ON ANIMAL TESTING ALTERNATIVES CONTINUES TODAY. THAT COMMITMENT ALSO EXTENDS GLOBALLY INCLUDING WHERE IN CHINA. THE COUNCIL REGULARLY ENGAGE WITH CHINESE REGULATORS SCIENTISTS AND TRADE OFFICIALS THE ADVOCATE FOR THE USE ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL TESTING. HERE IN CALIFORNIA SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE COUNCIL AS PART OF A DIVERSE COALITION OF HEALTH ANIMAL RIGHTS AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. CAME TOGETHER SUPPORT STATE LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES INDUSTRIES NON ANIMAL TESTING METHODS AND SUCH METHODS EXCESS. WE'VE THREE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AS DRAFTED. FIRST ALL THE CURRENT DRAFT INCLUDES AN EXEMPTION FOR ANIMAL TESTING REQUIRED BY FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. THAT EXEMPTION WOULD SUNSET THREE YEARS AFTER THE BILL'S ENACTMENT. THERE CURRENTLY ARE EXISTING EXISTING FOREIGN TESTING REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE AND THE SUNSET WOULD ONLY PROVIDE A BRIEF. AND QUITE FRANKLY AN UNREALISTIC PERIOD OF TIME CHANGING THOSE REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE PRODUCT CATEGORY. SECOND THE DRAFT INCLUDES AN EXEMPTION FOR TESTING REQUIRED BY FD A OR D. TSC. BUT NO OTHER FEDERAL OR STATE REGULATORY BODY AND ONLY UNDER VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DO NOT APPEAR TO COVER ALL. OR EVEN MOST OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN PLACE TODAY. FINALLY THE BILL WOULD BAN THE SALE OF PRODUCTS OF THOSE PRODUCTS OR INGREDIENTS IN THE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN TESTED I AM ON ANIMALS BY ANY ENTITY. GLOBALLY INCLUDING TESTING CONDUCTED BY ENTITIES ENTIRELY UNRELATED TO THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE PRODUCTS THEMSELVES. IF ENACTED IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE COUNCIL BELIEVES OF THE BILL WOULD CREATE TRADE BARRIERS PARTICULAR BETWEEN US AND CHINA. WOULD INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES TO MOVE CERTAIN OPERATIONS FROM CALIFORNIA TO CHINA. RESULTING IN LOSS OF JOBS AND REVENUE IN CALIFORNIA AND COULD ULTIMATELY BE ON THE CEILING CALVET CALIFORNIA OF KEY. PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS CATEGORICALLY. COSMETIC PRODUCTS ARE SOME CALIFORNIA MUST COMPLY WITH THE RANGE OF STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS I'M JUST GONNA HIGH LATE. BRIEFLY IF YOU THOSE RIGHT NOW. THE FEDERAL LEVEL FDA'S EXPLICITLY KNOWLEDGE THE ANIMAL TESTING MAY BE NECESSARY TO DEMONSTRATE SAFETY OF A PRODUCT OR INGREDIENT. IN EFFECT REQUIRE SUCH TESTING FOR CERTAIN COSMETIC DRUG PRODUCTS RIGHT NOW SUCH AS TOOTHPASTE. ON THE GLOBAL FRONT CHINA'S COSMETIC HYGIENE MANAGEMENT REGULATION MANDATES THE COMPANIES ASSURE PRODUCT SAFETY BITE HEARING TO STANDARDS THAT REQUIRE TESTING. INCLUDING TOXICITY TESTING ON ANIMALS. THREE PERFORMING ORDER FOR NEARLY ALL TYPES OF COSMETIC PRODUCTS INGREDIENTS WE PLACE ON THE MARKET IN CHINA. THE COUNSELOR MEANS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE TOLL FORTY NINE DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FOR THESE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. AND IS ALSO VERY CONCERNED THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED BAN IS OVERBROAD AND MAYBE TRIGGERED BY TESTING OVER WHICH MANUFACTURES HAVE NO CONTROL. OR WHICH THEY ARE NOT EVEN AWARE NOT TO MENTION THIS COULD POTENTIALLY INCENTIVIZE ANIMAL TESTING. FROM VARIOUS PURPOSES BY ANY PERSON SEEKING DISRUPT THE SELF COSMETICS IN CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE ALL THESE ISSUES COULD BE READILY ADDRESS WHILE STILL ALLOWING FOR STATE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD MEAN FLICKER TALE BECAUSE MANIC COSMETIC ANIMAL TESTING. PACIFIC LATER COUNCIL BELIEVES THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF THE EU'S COSMETIC REGULATION WHICH SUCCESSFULLY PHASED OUT COSMETIC ANIMAL TESTING IN THE EU WOULD PROVIDE A MORE REASONABLE. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. CRITICALLY THE EU COMMISSION AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE THE HIVE HIGHEST COURT IN THE YOU HAVE RECOGNIZE THE PRODUCTS THEY ARE CANNOT BE BE AND IF THEY'VE BEEN TESTED FOR PURPOSES OF COMPLIANCE AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THOSE OF CHINA. PROVIDED THE ANIMAL DATA IS NOT USED FOR COMPLIANCE THE EU COSMETICS REGULATION. IN SOME THE COUNCIL SUPPORTS THE FOLLOWING ALIGNING CALIFORNIA LAW THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK OF THE EEO IS TAILORED TO US IN CALIFORNIA LEGAL AND REGULATORY SCHEME. AND URGING CHINA TO ABOLISH EXISTING ANIMAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS AND GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED ANIMAL TESTING. THE DIRECT ADVOCACY AND EDUCATION RATHER THAN CREATING ARBITRARY HARMFUL BARRIERS TO TRADE. UNFORTUNATELY S. B. TWELVE FORTY NINE FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS. AND WOULD UNFAIRLY NEEDLESSLY PUNISH CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. WE ASK TO THE COMMITTEE REJECT SP TWELVE FOURTEEN ON ITS CURRENT FORM. AND COLLABORATE WITH INDUSTRY AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON A WORKABLE SOLUTION THAT SUPPORTS THE ELIMINATION OF ANIMAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS BOTH IN AND OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON KEPT KEY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. AND REGRETTABLE OPPOSITION TO SB TWELVE FORTY NINE AND I DO SAY REGRETTABLE AND WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY I LISTED SENATE BILL TWELVE FORTY NINE HOURS A MANUFACTURING BREAKER DUE TO ITS IMPACTS ON INNOVATION. AND INVESTMENT IN OTHER BECAUSE MY FOR YEAH THAT COULD ALSO HAVE RIPPLE EFFECTS EVEN BEYOND TO ADOPT INDUSTRY BASED ON THE INGREDIENT TESTINO HOW THAT MAY BE CONDUCTED FOR COMPLETELY UNRELATED PURPOSES AND IMPACTS THERE'VE. ADDITIONALLY -- THE BILL ALLIES A CONSTRUCTED EVEN I WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS RESPECTFULLY TO NOT ADDRESS IN FULL THE CHALLENGES MANUFACTURERS WOULD AND BE FORCED TO THE DEAL WITH. AS THOUGH I DO OUT EXEMPTIONS ARE VERY VERY I'M CRAFTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY ULTIMATELY EXCLUDE I'M SOME COSMETIC COMPANIES TO HAVE PERHAPS DIFFERENT PRODUCT LINES. AND AROUND KIND OF ANTI MICROBIAL THOSE OTHER PRODUCT LINES THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO OUT TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF TESTING HAVE FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS THAT ARE TESTED FOR OTHER PURPOSES -- AND SO DISADVANTAGES MANY COMPANIES THAT HAVE IT THAT HAS NO BEARING ON THE COSMETIC I IN IN QUESTION WHATSOEVER. OF FURTHER THE CONCERNS BEING THAT ON THE BROAD IMPLICATIONS FROM THE TRADE PERSPECTIVE CERTAINLY ARE NOT TO BE DISMISSED. I'M ULTIMATELY AND THE BILL HAVING SUCH SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WILL RESULT IN -- ESSENTIALLY A HUNGER GAMES SCENARIO IF YOU WILL GIVEN THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THOUGH NEW LANGUAGE WOULD REQUIRE A PRODUCT TO BE ON THE MARKET FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. AND BEFORE ANY INGREDIENT TO A TESTING CAN BE CONDUCTED SO SENSUAL YOU'RE STIFLING INNOVATION ON FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW THINGS WERDEN NEW INGREDIENTS ARE ULTIMATELY KIND OF PICKED OFF ONE BY ONE BECAUSE THERE MAY BE TESTING DEMOCRATIC FOR UNRELATED PURPOSES. BUT MAYBE YOU KNOW HAVE BEARING ON NEW INNOVATION IN TERMS OF THE USE OF THOSE -- ULTIMATELY AS AS JUST SECOND FROM THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL NOTED AND THE E. U. ALIGNMENTS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT SEEMS CA AND I ITS MEMBER COMPANIES WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET BEHIND. CERTAINLY MOVES THE NEEDLE FOR CALIFORNIA LAW MUCH FURTHER THAN WHERE WE ARE TODAY WOULD BE WORKABLE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE INDUSTRY IS WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY WITH CHINA TO MOVE THEM TOWARDS ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL TESTING AND ELIMINATE THAT BR ARE THE TESTING REQUIREMENT. BUT ULTIMATELY ONLY HAVE SO MUCH ABILITY TO IMPACT THAT AND CERTAINLY WE DON'T EXPECT THAT THAT'S GOING TO CURRENT BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE BETTER DOING SO YOU KNOW THAT ADVOCACY IN EARNEST -- FURTHER THE FACT AND THAT THIS WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE AN IMPACT ON JOBS IN THE STATE AS WELL I'M IN SPEAKING AT THE OUTSET. AROUND WITH THE PROPONENTS THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT WAYS TO AVOID THE CHINA TESTING REQUIREMENT WHICH WAS ULTIMATELY TO MOVE MANUFACTURING INTO THE COUNTRY TO AVOID THAT. AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS A MANUFACTURING ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S WRONG HEADED WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JOBS HERE IN THE STATE MANUFACTURING HERE IN THE STATE OF THE TORTILLA DECLINING NOT INDUSTRY. SO THESE ARE JUST BUT A FEW OF THE CONCERN I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND A NO VOTE ON THIS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYWHERE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. TO COME FORWARD AND GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. TOM JACOB ON BEHALF OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA AND SUCH. I RIGHTLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WERE CONCERNED THAT'LL HAVE -- JOB APPLICATIONS AND WE DON'T THINK GO UNDER THE CURRENT AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF TESTING FOR ANY PURPOSE THANKS THANK YOU. MARIN HIGGINS REPRESENTING BILE COME IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. I THINK NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE SAID I WANNA THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT THIS IS PROPOSING AND WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS DOING. BUT FRANKLY. THIS IS A PRETTY LARGE MARKET CALIFORNIA. AND IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO USE OUR MARKET PRESENCE TO SHIFT POLICY AT EVEN INTERNATIONAL POLICY WE DO THAT FROM TIME TO TIME IN THIS TO ME IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT TO MOVE AWAY FROM. ALLOWING LONG STANDING. AND TO ME OBJECTIONABLE PRACTICES IN. THIS INDUSTRY AND SO I THINK THIS BILL REALLY ESTABLISHES THAT THOSE CRITERIA WE WE WORK TO TRY AND THEY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S. OFFICE WORKING WITH US TO TRY AND THREAD SOME OF THESE -- TWO TO A POINT BUT FROM MY STANDPOINT I THINK THE BILL AS AMENDED MEETS THIS. STANDARDS FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND I'M HOPING THAT WE WILL. MOVE IT FORWARD. KALRA THAT MR MAIENSCHEIN. I THINK WAS SHARON THANK YOU SENATOR HUB FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- THING YOU KNOW I THINK A THE THING ABOUT COSMETICS YOU'VE PEOPLE USE COSMETICS FOR A LOT OF REASONS BUT I THINK UP OF THE PRIMARY REASONS IS THESE COSMETICS. TO LOOK GOOD AND FEEL GOOD A AND I THINK IT IS HARD TO DO THAT IF YOU KNOW THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE USING HAD THE TEST. I THINK THAT'S THE UNDERLYING CONNECT THE M. AND M. EVEN AND NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY TO TALK TO THE FOLKS WHO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT OPPOSITION AS WELL AND I DON'T ANYONE DISAGREES THAT. ITS A POSITIVE GOAL -- INCLUDING INDUSTRY OF COURSE HE'LL THAT INDEED MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION EVEN ON THEIR OWN TO IN MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION SO I THINK. I DON'T THINK THAT. AND ONCE. BUDGET ISSUES KIND OF INTERNATIONALLY AS WELL AS SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON I GET AND I GET I ET THAT. I'M BUT I DO THINK THAT. AS TO THE CHAIR'S POINT LOOK. IF IF CALIFORNIA THE FIFTH LARGEST CALM THE WORLD -- JOINS FORTY OTHER NATIONS SUB IT WOULD BE AMONGST THE LARGEST NATION JOINING IN THAT PARTNERSHIP -- IF YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT NO ANIMAL TESTING IS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THAT IS WHAT. MOVES THE NATIONS LIKE CHINA AND OTHERS THAT'S WHAT CREATES THE MOMENTUM IN MY OPINION -- IT TO REALLY CREATE INTERNATIONAL CHANGE ON THE ISSUE. A CRUELTY FREE COSMETICS ARE ARE NOT A NOVELTY -- I THINK IT'S MORE MORE UBIQUITOUS IN CALIFORNIA AND AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD -- AND AND I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR -- INCLUDING THE THE EXEMPTION TO LIMIT EXEMPTS OF ANIMAL TESTING FOR NON COSMETIC PURPOSES NOW MY GUESS IS THAT A AND AND BASED UPON THAT THE TESTIMONY THAT. DOESN'T SAY SATISFIED OPPOSITION BUT I DO THINK THAT'S A GOOD FAITH. I'M AMENDMENT ADMIT TO RECOGNIZE -- THAN THAT THE GOAL HERE AYE IS NOT TO SHUT DOWN COMPANIES -- BECAUSE OF SOME CHEMICAL THAT HAPPENS TO BE IN ONE OF THE PRODUCTS IS BEING USED FOR SOMETHING IN HIM THAT I THE IDEA HERE IS RELATED TRIED NEARLY FOCUS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. MY GUESS IS THAT THAT THE OPTION BY BILLS COULD BE DONE THAT BE MORE WORK DONE ON THAT AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS. OF IS TO CONTINUE THE TO HAVE DIALOGUE AND CONTINUE TO WORK -- AND NO LONG TERM. IN TERMS OF THIS MOVEMENT AT THE I DON'T BELIEVE THE GOAL IS TO FIND A WAY TO COEXIST WITH ANIMAL TESTED COSMETICS LONG TERM THE GOAL IS TO ELIMINATE ANIMAL TESTED COSMETICS ON THE PLANET. AND THAT HAPPENS WHEN I'M WITH WHEN WE ARE BOLD ABOUT IT AND I DO THINK THAT THE EU WAS BORED WHEN THEY WENT FORWARD AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THIS ISN'T AN EVEN BOLDER STEP TO SOME EXTENT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S A IT'S IT'S GOING THAT FAR. OF ONE OF FAR ALONG -- TO AB YOU ATTEMPT TO BE AS DAMAGING TO THE INDUSTRY AS AS THEIR AS THE FEARS THAT IT DIDN'T. OUTLINED OTHERS FOUR AND HALF YEARS TO A TO WORK. TO TRY TO MOVE CONTINUE TO MOVE CHINA IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION RATHER THAN HAVING TO GET EXEMPTIONS BY COMPANY BY COMPANY WHICH SEEMS LIKE A VERY. KIND OF INEFFICIENT WAY OF DOING IT I THINK THAT THAT YOU CAN HELP. MORE THAN ANY NATION EVEN ADOPTING IT GET GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE MARKET. IN MOVING CHINA IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I WANT TO THANK THAT THE SENATOR -- I I WOULD BE HAPPY TO JOIN AS A CO AUTHOR AND WORK WITH YOU AS I TEND TO THE EXTENT YOU LIKE TO WITH OPPOSITION TO CONTINUE. TO HAVE THAT DIALOGUE TO MAKE SURE THAT TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE WE CAN GET INDUSTRY AND WORKS I DO THINK THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT. INDUSTRY AND ITS HEART WANTS TO BE YOU WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF BUT I I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW THAT THEIR OBLIGATIONS THAT YOU HAVE ITS AID TO THE TO THE COMPANY'S REPRESENT AS WELL -- AND SO -- THANK YOU I'VE SENATOR ONCE AGAIN A LITTLE THAT I LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION IS THERE SECONDS. AND A SECOND THANK YOU MISTER BRAINCHILD OF THE MISTER GABRIEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- I THINK IT IT IT'S QUITE CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS WILL NOT ONLY -- SAVE THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS BUT IT IT WILL ALSO -- SAVE TORTURE A OF SO MANY MORE. AND DATA. HOW TELL YOU WHY I'M A SINGLE DAD TO GIRLS SO WE ARE? EVERYONE. SAYS I NEED TO SAY ANYTHING IN THERE ARE. THE CROWDS LIKE WE NEED TO GIVE HIM A HUG [inaudible] THANK YOU -- NO AYE WE ARE JUST ENTERING THE WORLD THAT HAVE MAKE UP I AND SO THAT'S INTERESTING BUT BUT I HAVE TAUGHT HIM YOU KNOW I OF THIS IS THAT THERE. WHERE DO YOU SERIOUS BUT I WAS JUST SO HAPPY WITH THAT RESPONSE IT'S LIKE THAT IT CUT? ITS A BIG MOMENT FOR ME -- YOUR SINGLE DAD YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF FEET YOU KNOW NOT A PAN THAT'S ON THE BACK -- BUT NO BUT WHEN WE YOU KNOW WHEN WE ARE YOU KNOW I DO GO WITH THEM TO GO TO GO SHOPPING FOR THIS AND I HAVE TAUGHT THEM TO LOOK FOR THE CRUELTY FREE LABELS -- I SPENT SOMETIME IN YOUR START TO MAP. A LOT. AND THAT AND AND THIS IS IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME AS A AS A AS A VALUE TO TEACH THEM. AND I'LL AND I'LL TELL YOU AND I ADMITTEDLY. YOU KNOW THIS MY FIRST VENTURE INTO THIS AREA BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S NOT. PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR THEM IT'S NOT IT'S NOT LIKE THEY KEEP YOU KEEP THIS CAN'T BE DONE THIS ISN'T AN IMPOSSIBLE. LEAP -- SO -- AND I THINK THIS IS A A A MUCH MORE HUMANE IT MUCH MORE COMPASSIONATE APPROACH I THINK THERE PROBABLY ARE SOME YOU KNOW SOME. LANGUAGE IF SOMETHING'S AND LANGUAGE THAT THAT PROBABLY COULD BE. CLEARED UP OR MADE MORE CLEAR IN RESPONSE TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID AS WELL -- AND I NOTE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND MAKING SURE THINGS ARE CLEAR -- BUT EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO COME TO POINT WHERE THIS ISN'T EVEN GOING TO BE AN ISSUE -- BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE MOVED NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND REALLY WORLDWIDE PASSED THIS -- AND WON'T BE IT THIS THIS WON'T BE A THING THAT IN TERMS OF COSMETICS NEEDS TO BE TESTED ON ANIMALS ANYMORE -- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DAY AND IN THE MEANTIME CERTAINLY VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AT THANK YOU TELL YOU IN THE AUDIENCE. FOR YOUR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT FOR ME TODAY. AND HAPPY TO TO SECOND THIS AND SEE THIS MOVE ON THANK YOU MISTER GABRIEL THE MISS CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CENTER I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION I WANTED. TO SUCH HIT MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF OUR CHAIRMAN I THINK THIS IS AT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO USE OUR MARKET POWER IN THE WITH OUR VALUES AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE ADDED OUR SELF TO THE LIST OF OF NATIONS THAT HAVE GONE CRUELTY FREE. SO AND PLEASED TO BE SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION AND I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK ME OUT IT IS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S GOING TO HELP. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR A LARGELY THE OPPOSITION ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED BY ANYBODY UP WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACT ON JOBS AT I'M STRUGGLING WITH THAT PIECE OF IT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE IN AN ERA. INTERNATIONALLY WERE WERE SORT OF READ VISITING AND RE OPENING -- DISCUSSIONS WITH IN PARTICULAR CHINA -- ON ALL NUMBERS OF ALL MANNER OF TRADE ISSUES. RIGHT AND AS I UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATION THAT GIVES THE SORT OF A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. FOR BEFORE IT REALLY TAKES EFFECT IN ANY SORT OF TOTAL BAN WOULD WOULD. WOULD TAKE EFFECT SO. THAT SEEMS TO BE TO ME TO MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON JOBS. BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A PHASE IN PERIOD ONE AND TWO IT GIVES US FIVE YEARS TO MAYBE -- PUT THIS INTO THE THE INTERNATIONAL RENEGOTIATION OF TRADE ISSUES TYPE POTENTIAL USE AS THE I CHAIR RIGHTLY POINTED OUT USE ARE SIGNIFICANT MARKET POWER IN CALIFORNIA. TOOK PERHAPS PUSH -- THAT COUNTRY IN A CRUELTY FREE DIRECTION SO COULD I JUST LIKE MAYBE A RESPONSE FROM BOTH OF YA ABSOLUTE AS A AT SOMEONE AND THINK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK IT CONVERTS TO FULL NOT ONLY RELATIVE TO THE CHINA EXEMPTION AND SUNSET DATE THERE BUT ALSO THE LANGUAGE AROUND THE TESTING FOR ANY PURPOSE. AND TRYING TO KIND OF ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. RELATIVE TO THE CHINA SUNSET DATE WE HAVE A GUN NO ASSURANCES THAT HOW CHINA WILL MOVE AWAY FROM THE REQUIREMENTS AROUND TOO YOU KNOW REQUIRING DOT COMPANIES THAT WANT TO SELL INTO THE CHINESE MARKET TOWN WILL TEST. THERE'S NO DATE CERTAIN CERTAINLY THE INDUSTRY IS LOBBYING AND I'M TRYING TO EDUCATE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND PUSHING FOR THEM TO ELIMINATE THOSE REQUIREMENTS TWENTY TWENTY THREE THERE'S NO CERTAINTY AND NOT FOR THESE COMPANIES. AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN COMPANIES ARE FACED WITH THE KNOW THAT DECIDING TO HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SELL INTO THE CHINESE MARKET. ORINDA CALIFORNIA THE CHINESE MARKET IS A LARGER MARKET THAN CALIFORNIA SO THAT THAT'S IT A CHALLENGING. DECISION TO MAKE AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE FORCE WITH HAVING TO MAKE THAT TYPE OF DECISION TO SPECIFICALLY RELATIVE TO THAT REQUIREMENT. YOU KNOW IS IT DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO BE ABLE TO DO BOTH CHIU UP AND MOVE YOUR JOBS INTO CHINA TO AVOID THAT TESTING REQUIREMENT IS CHINA. FOR THOSE COMPANIES THAT ARE MANUFACTURING IN COUNTRY VERY THEY DON'T HAVE TO ABIDE BY THAT PARTICULAR TESTING REQUIREMENT SO UPS AND IT BASICALLY FORCES A MANUFACTURER. CHAPTER DECIDE TO MOVE THEIR MENU. FROM CALIFORNIA INTO CHINA TO AVOID THAT TESTING REQUIREMENT IT THAT TWENTY TWENTY THREE DAY COMES AND GOES AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAVE ELIMINATED THAT WERE TESTING REQUIREMENT IMPORT. THAT'S THE PREDICAMENT MANUFACTURERS WHO WHO SELL INTO THE CHINESE MARKET WILL FIND THEMSELVES AND RELATIVE TO THE NEW LANGUAGE US AS PROPOSED. AND THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS IS THAT FOR SOME COMPANIES -- WHO MAY BE INVOLVED AND KIND OF HAD MULTIPLE PRODUCTS SECTOR ON A LINES I YOU KNOW SON YOU KNOW MADE YOU ARE INTO YOU THROUGH YOU KNOW I'M? KIND OF LIFE SCIENCES WORK AND SO IS PART OF THAT WORK WHETHER BE YOU KNOW FOR PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT JUST ARE IN DE RELATED TO YOU KNOW OTHER GREEN CHEMISTRY RELATED PURPOSES. ULTIMATELY IF THE IF A MANUFACTURER A COSMETIC BECAUSE THE COSMETIC LINE ALSO HAS A SUBSIDIARY THAT'S ALSO DOING KIND ARE IN DIFFERENT WITHOUT WHATEVER YOU KNOW OTHER INDUSTRY SECTOR PRODUCT PURPOSE. THEY WOULD BE OF THEIR POT COSMETIC PRODUCTS WOULD BE BANNED UNDER THIS LANGUAGE FURTHER IF A COMPANY YOU KNOW PERHAPS HAS -- OTHER PRODUCT LINES THAT YOU KNOW OUR DISINFECTANTS DISINFECTANTS YOU KNOW THE TERMS OF KIND OF HER CONSIDERED A PESTICIDE BASED ON THAT THIS ANTI MICROBIAL DISINFECTANT PROPERTIES. ARE REQUIRED AS PART OF THE USE OF THOSE PRODUCTS TO CONDUCT TESTING FOR THE PURPOSES OF MAKING SURE THAT THOSE DISINFECTANTS ACTUALLY KILLED THE THE BY TEARING OF THE VIRUSES. VETERAN QUESTION THAT'S THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE SO ULTIMATELY THAT TYPE OF COMPANY ALSO WOULD HAVE THEIR COSMETIC SUBSIDIARY AND THEIR PRODUCTS BEYOND BECAUSE UNDER THIS LANGUAGE. IT MEANS S. TO LIMIT THAT YOU KNOW TESTING FOR ANY PURPOSE BUT IT DISADVANTAGES THOSE COMPANIES HAVE MAY HAVE SOME YOU KNOW MULTI SECTOR LINES IN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS HERE IN THE STATE. SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES ABOUT HOW THEY'D THEY WOULD HAVE TRUE CALIFORNIA JOB IMPACTS TO AND THOSE ARE BUT JUST A COUPLE OF OF EXAMPLES OF OF REAL LIFE IMPLICATIONS. COULD I GET A RESPONSE YET PARTLY YES SO WHAT WHAT. THESE ARGUMENTS WERE BROUGHT UP DURING THE U. EUROPEAN UNION -- HEARINGS ALL THE SAME TYPE OF ARGUMENTS AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH JOBS IS JOBS GREW AND HERE'S WHERE JOBS GROW WHICH WE LOVE IS IN THE TECH INDUSTRY. MEETING THESE REQUIREMENTS OF ALL THESE NEW ALTERNATIVE TEST AND OPENING IT UP WHEN I DID OUR DUE DILIGENCE ON THIS BILL. AND TALKING TO COMPANIES LIKE LIFE AND JOHN PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS JOHN PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS LIKE I SAID THEIR INCEPTION THIRTY EIGHT YEARS AGO CRUELTY FREE. THEY WANTED TO BE IN CHINA RIGHT. AND SO THEY SAID HOW. AND THE CHINESE REGULATORS WORKED WITH THEM. ON A TEST THAT'S OUT OF BOSTON THAT COMPANY IS CALLED MAY TECH. AND THAT CHINESE REGULATORS SAID THE SOUL SATISFY OUR REQUIREMENTS THEY NOW. ARE MOVING ALL THEIR SKEWS YES THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS YES IT WAS A BY DEFAULT BUT WHEN JOHN PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS SAID HEY. WE WANT TO STAY CRUELTY FREE THE CHINESE REGULATORS MADE IT HAPPEN SO YOU GROW JOBS BECAUSE A WILL BE THE LEADER AND CRUELTY FREE. SO OF COURSE MORE COMPANIES WILL FLOURISH BY CHANGING THEIR PRODUCT LINES THEY'RE GONNA SELL MORE PRODUCT BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO BUY CRUELTY FREE. AND THEN THE TECH SECTOR ALL ALSO GROWS WITH THIS SO YOU KNOW YES THERE'S TEST ON THE MARKET YES WE HAVE PLENTY TO USE THAT ARE SAFER THAN THE ANIMAL TESTS. BUT THAT MARKET WILL GROW AND IT WILL KEEP MOVING SO YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF RED HERRINGS A THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED. AND THAT WE CAN'T JUSTIFY THESE ARGUMENTS AND THESE ARGUMENTS WERE MADE ONCE UPON A TIME YEARS AGO WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THEY HAVE BEEN FLESHED OUT. SO THAT IS MY RESPONSE -- AND ALI BABA HOW SORRY ONE MORE THAT YOU WANT TO COVER ALI BABA AND I THINK BUT WHO THE HECK. I THINK THAT DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OR TO EXPLORE THAT FURTHER PAGES LOTUS IF YOU HAD. AND A BRIEF ADDITIONAL YEAH BRIEFLY I WE WERE JUST GOING TO MENTION THAT THERE THE ON THE LARGEST ONLINE RETAILER ALIBABA DOT COM COMPANIES CAN UTILIZE THAT TO REACH THE ENTIRE CHINESE MARKET AS WELL. AND HONG KONG ALSO HAS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF REGULATIONS AS THE REST OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND ANY YOU COULD HAVE. A STOREFRONT IN HONG KONG UTILIZED THAT A LARGE PART OF THE CHINESE MARKET WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO CONDUCT ANIMAL TESTING AND IT'S A MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR MARKET AND WE LEFT THE DOCUMENTS IN THE TWENTY YEAR OFFICES SO I JUST AS WELL NOT IF YOU HOLD ON HOLD ON MISTER. CUNNINGHAM HAS GOOD LORD I DON'T WANT FOLKS TO JUMPING IN THIS IS NOT. A FREE FOR ALL. APPRECIATE THE PASSION. COULD I JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT ON THE YEAR AND AS I NOTED IN MY TESTIMONY WHAT'S INVOLVED IN THE U. IS IN IT AT CARVE OUT FOR THE TESTING REQUIRED IN CHINA FOR SOME OF THE REASONS THAT WE DISCUSSED TODAY AND SO THESE ISSUES WERE CONSIDERED IN THE DEVELOPMENT. OF THE EU LEGISLATION BUT THE CURRENT STATE OF THAT IS THAT DOES NOT APPLY. THE TESTING THAT'S DONE IN REQUIRED RENT IT FOR CHINA UP PURPOSES SUCH HUNTINGTON MAKE THAT CLEAR. LUCAS DRESS AND THEN MISTER KILEY. JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION. YOU DID SAY THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING. TO USE FOR THE USE OF ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL TESTING APPRECIATE THAT. AND THAT -- YOU YOU DO SUPPORT A STOP TO ANIMAL TESTING IN AND OUT OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT. THE BILL ITSELF THEN. PUTS US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- I RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO MAKE SURE GET YOUR YOUR COMMENTS ARE WELL TAKEN ABOUT THE JOBS I THINK THE RESPONSE -- TO MISTER CUNNINGHAM'S QUESTIONS. ARE ALSO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO SEE THAT. WE MAY NOT HAVE THAT IMPACT THE JOBS THAT MAY BE EXPECTED BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WE ARE LOOKING TO BE AT A POINT WHERE WE ARE NO LONGER. DOING ANIMAL TESTING FOR COSMETICS IT'S I THINK THIS IS A GOOD START I THINK THAT GIVING THAT PERIOD OF TIME -- TO FOR THE ADJUSTMENT I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT I THE THE OBJECTIONS THAT ARE STILL THERE I KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE AUTHOR WILL BE ABLE TO WORK. WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SEE WHAT OTHER AMENDMENTS NEED TO BE TAKEN BUT I THINK THAT WE'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY -- DEFECT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE DISCUSSION ON THIS AND AND CERTAINLY I APPRECIATE ALL THE FOLKS WHO HAVE COME IN SUPPORT OF THE OF THE BILL IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE. SO MANY PEOPLE ENGAGED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S FOR SUCH A GOOD BECAUSE AS I TO QUESTION SENATOR ABOUT SORT OF WHY YOU CHOSE -- TO STRUCTURES THE WAY YOU HAVE WE'VE HEARD THAT YOU REGULATIONS SERVICE CITED ON BOTH SIDES IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND DIE IN THE BILL'S GENERATE A LOT OPPOSITION NOT JUST FROM THE COSMETICS INDUSTRY BUT ALSO FROM -- ORGANIZATIONS -- THAT MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS THAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER NOT MERELY AESTHETIC AND BUT MORE VITAL -- IT SEEMS LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUILD -- YOU MIGHT STILL BE ABLE TO BUILD A BROADER CONSENSUS IF YOU MORE CLOSELY ALIGN OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE EU SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT. DOING THAT IS ONE OF WHY YOU DECIDED TO GO ABOUT THIS. YES WE HAD AN AND THAT. YEARS WE WERE SEEKING TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE OPPOSITION WE HAVE TAKEN ON THREE MAJOR AMENDMENTS AS WE SEE THEM UP TO TRY TO WORK TOWARD -- ACCOMMODATING THE SITUATION THAT IS IN CHINA AYE THAT'S WHY WE HAD THE EXEMPTION AND TELL TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IT WILL FOLLOW THE LEAD WHEN THEY SEE THAT CALIFORNIA AND THESE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE ABLE TO DO IT. AND THAT THAT TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE IS AVAILABLE AND WHEN THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE WORKING WITH PAUL MITCHELL SYSTEMS AND THAT. WITH THOSE PRODUCTS THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE ANIMAL CRUELTY FREE. A WE BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD WERE GIVING FIVE YEARS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT -- WERE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION ON OTHER AMENDMENTS AS WELL AND THIS IS BETTER OF OF WORK IN PROGRESS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO BRING TWO DIVERGENT SIDES. WHO I BELIEVE REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR ULTIMATELY A BUT WE WE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON HOW TO GET THERE? AND ON THIS BEFORE YOU TODAY AS A STEP FORWARD ON EVEN MORE PROGRESS THAN WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE E. U. BUT GETS A WORK IN PROGRESS WERE TRIED TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED. THANK YOU AND I HAVE A QUESTION AND MAYBE BEST RESPONSIBLE ALSO FOR THE AUTHOR AND DOWN. I'M JUST TRYING -- TO YOU KNOW I I THINK ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE A VERY COMPELLING ON YOUR SIDE I'M TRYING TO THINK ABOUT -- THE ETHICS OF ANIMAL TESTING AND SO WHAT KIND [inaudible] FAR AS WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE IS EVER APPROPRIATE IS IT ONLY APPROPRIATE FOR SOME PURPOSES AS OPPOSED TO OTHERS. WE HAVE THE A SCIENTIST WITH US TODAY ELISABETH BAKER FROM PHYSICIANS COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE SHE IS ALSO A CO SPONSOR. AND HER JOB ACTUALLY IS MARION UP THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY -- TO REPLACE ANIMAL TEST OUTSIDE OF COSMETIC SO I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER AND I'M NOT THAT SCIENTISTS BUT I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT ELIZABETH DOES FOR A LIVING. IS PHASING OUT WHERE YOU CAN -- I ALSO SIT ON THE BED MARY MEDICAL BOARD AND I'VE BEEN ON THE BOARD FOR EIGHT YEARS AND ONE OF THE VETERINARIANS THAT SITS NEXT TO ME MY SEAT MATE. IS DR JAMIE NOBLE WHEN AND SHE IS WITH OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND DAVIS. AND IT'S OVER ANIMAL SCIENCES RIGHT. AND SO I VAST YOU AMY YOU KNOW HEY WHEN YOU GUYS GONNA DO AWAY WITH ANIMAL TESTING AND SHE SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'VE REPLACED WHERE THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE WE USE IT. SO THAT'S THE ANSWER IS AS PLEASE TEST COME FORWARD. AND THEY ARE AS GOOD OR BETTER IS THE REAL ANSWER THEN THE ANIMAL TEST. THE EMERALD HAS GOT TO GO AWAY. THERE'S NO REASON TO KEEP IT ANYMORE. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE ANSWER THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS ALRIGHT [inaudible] SEEING NONE. SENATE I FOR ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER DISAPPOINTED IF THIS. JUST WENT BACK TO WHAT THE E. U. DEAD AND DOESN'T ADVANCE THE THIS THE STATE OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO RESPECT ANIMAL TESTING I WOULD LOVE TO SEE S.. B. A LITTLE. EVEN STRICTER IF IF POSSIBLE BUT I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO NAVIGATE OPPOSITION AND SUPPORT AND AND AND DO SOMETHING THAT THAT ADVANCES THE STATE OF WHERE WE ARE. BUT ALSO IS GOING TO GET OUT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN AND GET TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK SIDE I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE. THAT YOU DOING THERE AND HELPING TO CREATE AND USING OUR LEGISLATIVE POWER IN OUR MARKET POWER. TO DRIVE RESULTS. INTERNATIONALLY WE CAN WE CAN DO THAT. FORCING MORE CALIFORNIA'S HAVING TO STEP IN EVEN WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS KIND OF BACKING OFF SO I THINK THAT. THE SPOTLIGHT IS ON CALIFORNIA THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE MOVE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT AND WITH THAT HE MAKE CLUBS. THANK YOU I THINK WHAT WE REALLY SEE HERE IS TWO DIVERGENT SIDES WHAT WE'RE TRYING -- TO AS YOU SAY MOVE THE BALL FORWARD -- AND MAKE PROGRESS. IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH BOTH SIDES. I APPRECIATE THE THE WORDS OF SUPPORT HERE TODAY IN THE COMMITTEE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SO THE WE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS.

CENTER HUESO WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SO MEMBERS -- I DO NOT A CENT ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS A BILL THAT SEEKS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS BY EXPANDING LANGUAGE ACCESS SERVICES. WITHIN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. OUR FIRST I'D LIKE TO ASK THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE TO AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. TO DROP AMENDMENTS TO SEE PROVIDE GREATER PROTECTION FOR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT. LITIGANTS. I'M I'M ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS A GIVEN PROPOSED AND THEY'VE MADE MAKE THE BILL BETTER AND THEY HELP US. GET TO OUR ARE TARGETED GOAL. FIRST OF ALL. THANK YOU THERE IS A MOTION SIR SECONDS. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU UP. FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO STAY IN I'VE BEEN. IN THIS LEGISLATURE SINCE TWENTY TEN AND THAT YEAR WE WERE ENTERTAINING. ENORMOUS CUTS TO THE BUDGET THAT TOOK OUR OUR OUR STATE GENERAL FUND FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS TO EIGHTY FIVE BILLION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID IN THAT BUDGET WAS PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR EDUCATION TO MAKE SURE THAT EDUCATION DIDN'T SEE ANY CUTS. THE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WAS THAT EVERY OTHER DEPARTMENTS WOULD WAS WAS UNDERFUNDED. DRASTICALLY ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT REALLY TOOK A HARD HIT. WAS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND THE COURTS AND I REMEMBER. HAVING TO STAND UP AND YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND BE ONE OF THOSE VOICES STANDING UP FOR NOT CLOSE SEEN. OUR OUR COURTROOMS AND I'VE FOUGHT REALLY HARD TO KEEP. A LOT OF OUR OUR THE COURTS OPEN. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD AT CLOSED SOME IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE AND THAT HAD -- A VERY DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON GETTING ACCESS FOR PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS. AND WE'VE STILL BEEN TRYING TO CORRECT THAT AND WE ARE NOT WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN FUNDING THE COURTS OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND THAT HAS HAD AFFECTS SERVICES IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. THE JEWISH BE JUDICIAL GOT COUNSEL A CONVENED. AND FOUND A WAY -- TO THEY THEY THAT THEY WERE THEY FORMED A WORKING GROUP. THAT -- HAS SOUGHT TO CREATE THE MOST EXPENSIVE POLICY POSSIBLE UNDER THE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE. TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE CAN PROVIDE LANGUAGE THE INTERPRETATION AND LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE. IN THE SMALL CLAIMS AREA OF DIGITAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THIS IS PART OF A GREATER PROGRAM. TO GET CHIU 1100% ACCESS TO A LANGUAGE. CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST DIVERSE STATE IN THE UNION WE HAVE MORE THAN TWO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS. SPOKEN IN THE STATE -- WE WE HAVE. SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS JUST THAT'S THAT SAY THEY CANNOT SPEAK ENGLISH WELL OR PROFICIENTLY. AND AS THEY NAVIGATE -- THE COURT SYSTEM YOU KNOW WE'RE FINDING IF YOU HAVE 44% OF THE RESIDENTS TO SPEAK. A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME WHEN IT COMES. TO INTRANET COURTROOM AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE. THE THE IT'S REPUTATION SERVICES TO ENSURE. THAT THEY CAN MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS AND IN THE PROCESS OF ACHIEVING JUSTICE. SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL I HAVE JOINED -- THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE MEDINA FULLER INTO NO QUALIA WHO CHAIRS THIS WORKING GROUP. WHO HAS -- COME UP WITH A A SOLUTION WITHIN THE WORKING GROUP. THAT IS IS PRACTICABLE THAT IS ACHIEVABLE. AND THAT IS A IMPLEMENTABLE. UNDER THE CONSTRAINTS OF FACING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN FORCE BY THEM BY THE BY THE BUDGET CUTS THAT. WE HAVE HAD OVER THE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. GOING BACK AS FAR AS TWO THOUSAND NIGHT. A S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE ADOPTS LANGUAGE ACCESS TAX WARS RECENT RECOMMENDATIONS. US SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL MAKE SMALL CLAIMS OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOWING THE COURT TO APPOINT A CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED INTERPRETER. IT AUTHORIZES THE COURTS TO POINT CERTIFIED REGISTERED. OUR INTERPRETERS IN SMALL CLAIMS PROCEEDINGS IT PROVIDES JUDICIAL OFFICERS WITH DISCRETION TO ALLOW A LITIGANT TO OPT FOR THE USE OF A TEMPORARY INTERPRETER. IF AN ATTEMPT TO SECURE A CERTIFIED REGISTERED OR PROVISIONALLY QUALIFIED INTERPRETERS NOT SUCCESSFUL. AND ESTABLISHES STANDARDS BY WHICH TEMPORARY INTERPRETERS COULD BE UTILIZED AND SMALL CAME CLAIMS PROCEEDINGS. I HAVE -- SOME WITNESSES. UP UP WANT ONE THING BEFORE WE GO THE WITNESSES UP. I JUST WANTED TO STATE THAT THE THE PROCEDURAL AND RICK REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL SUNSET. IN A JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH IS AN AMENDMENT. THAT WE ACCEPTED BUT IT'S ALSO SOMETHING I I THINK WILL ALLOW US TO REACH OUR GOALS IN THE INTERIM. BY THEN I THINK THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WILL WILL. NOT ONLY IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM THAT'LL GIVE THEM TIME TO EXPAND IT AS WELL AND GET THE INTERPRETERS INTO THE SYSTEM THAT CURRENTLY ARE NOT THERE. IT'LL TAKE AWHILE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT BY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE WILL NEED WHAT WE'VE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS. IT'S PROGRAM IS FULLY IN PLACE SO -- WILL GO GO TO OUR MISTER CHAIR -- I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE -- TO KEY WITNESSES OUT TO WATCH THIS BILLS -- THAT THE NEED FOR THIS BILL WE HAVE ANDY LIPPMAN BOMB. REPRESENTING THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE LEXI HOWARD. THE ARE THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA JUDGE ASSOCIATION HERE TO SPEAK ON THE MERITS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE ALRIGHT MY NAME IS ANDY LEVON VON THANK YOU OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I A WORK FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TODAY. UNDER CURRENT LAW AS SENATOR WAS SO SAID THERE REALLY ISN'T CLARITY WHETHER SMALL CLAIMS ARE ACTUALLY PROCEEDINGS FOR THE PURPOSES. OF A INTERPRETER SERVICES AND SB ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE WOULD CLARIFY THAT. THIS LACK OF CLARITY HAS RESULTED IN A PATCHWORK OF INFORMAL AN INCONSISTENT PRACTICES IN THE ARENA OF INTERPRETERS FOR SMALL CLAIMS LITIGANTS. S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE PROVIDES A STATEWIDE CONSISTENT APPROACH TO PROVIDING INTERPRETERS TO SMALL CLAIMS LITIGANTS. CURRENTLY THERE'S AN UNFORTUNATE SHORTAGE OF INTERPRETERS ESPECIALLY IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN SPANISH. SO S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE WOULD ENSURE THAT A QUARTER UNDERTAKES DUE DILIGENCE TO FIND AN INTERPRETER IN ANY LANGUAGE. AND PROVIDES A SENATOR WAS SO SAID A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR THAT LITIGANTS. IF AN INTERPRETER CANNOT BE FOUND. BUT THAT LITIGATE WOODS. WOULD SUFFER UNDUE HARDSHIP IF THE PRECEDING HAD TO BE DELAYED -- OUR EXPERIENCE IS UP UNFORTUNATELY THAT MANY LITIGANTS AREN'T GOING TO RETURN TO COURT IF THEIR DAY IN COURT IS DELAYED. WHILE WE AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON THROUGHOUT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WOULD LOVE TO SEE FULL AVAILABILITY OF LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION IN ANY LANGUAGE FOR ANY NEED THAT A LITIGANT WOULD HAVE COMING TO COURT. WERE CERTAINLY JUST NOT THERE YET SO THE COUNCIL IS PROPOSING SB ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE AS AN INCREMENTAL STEPS SO THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT AND GET CLOSER TO IT IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT US WEST MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LEXI HOWARD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT. THIS IS THE COURTS WORKING HARD TO GET THIS RIGHT RESPECTFULLY REQUESTS DRIVE UP. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT SING THAT OPPOSITION. TWENTY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KEVIN BAKER FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA -- YOU KNOW IT'S AN ARTICLE OF FAITH FOR THOSE OF US WHO WORK IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAT WE DON'T MAKE THE PERFECT THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL IS NOT THE GOOD AND I WANT. TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND ON THE DEDICATION OF COMMITTEE COUNSEL NICOLETTE QUE FOUNDED AMENDMENTS MAKE IT HARDER FOR THE COURTS. TO DENY AN INTERPRETER BUT THEY DON'T PROHIBIT THE COURTS FROM DENYING INTERPRETER AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE ANYONE WHO HAS LOOKED AT THIS BODY OF LAW [inaudible] AGREES. THAT AN INTERPRETER IS REQUIRED. ALL COURT PROCEEDINGS. AND THERE'S REALLY NO DISPUTE ABOUT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. JUDICIAL COUNCIL ITSELF. HAS -- ACKNOWLEDGED. THAT THAT'S ITS OBLIGATION AND THE ACTIVITY ANALYSIS I THINK REFLECTS THAT LAW SO IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK THAT THE MOOD IN A JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS OPTED TO SPONSOR A BILL THAT CONFLICTS WITH THAT VERY CLEAR OBLIGATION. ON TEN YEARS AGO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL KILLED EFFORTS -- TO ENACT -- I INTERPRETER EXPANSION AND IN CIVIL CASES IT USED THE VERY SAME ARGUMENTS THAT IT'S USING TODAY. CATCH IT WOULD BE TOO COSTLY THE INTERPRETERS AREN'T THERE EXCEPT. FOR WHAT IF PHONE. UNDER THOMPSON PRESSURE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE UNDER BECAUSE THAT INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING IS THAT IN FACT IT COULD. AND IN FACT 80% OF THE SMALL CLAIMS COURTS INDEED ARE ALREADY PROVIDING. INTERPRETERS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT HAS OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO SYZYGY DOCUMENT FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL INDICATING THAT AS OF DECEMBER -- OF TWENTY SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO ON THE COURTS WERE ALREADY PROVIDING -- INTERPRETERS IN SMALL CLAIMS CASES AND 80% OF THE COURTS SO THIS ACTUALLY SETS US BACK. BY SAYING THAT THE COURTS DON'T HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING -- THE ALLEN. YOU KNOW IT'S IT. IT IS CENTER DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT WE DO WITH THIS BILL THE LEGISLATURE CAN ENACT ON THIS STATUTE TO SAY THAT INTERPRETERS ARE NOT REQUIRE THAT THE DISCRETIONARY? ON THAT ON THEY THEY MAY NOT BE NECESSARY BUT THAT WILL NOT CHANGE THE STATE'S OUR OBLIGATIONS -- THE STATE STATUTES CANNOT STAND IS AN IMPEDIMENT TO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAW WE'VE LEARNED THAT FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN SOME OTHER STATES WERE SLOW TO CHANGE OTHERS OF CIVIL RIGHTS STATUTES. AND ARMED WITH ITS IT IS STILL THE CASE NOW. ALLEN BUT IT WILL BE UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I THINK IT SENDS A MESSAGE [inaudible] TO THE COURTS ARE NOW DOING THE RIGHT THING THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO AND IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO ARM OUR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT POPULATIONS THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT SENATOR HUESO SPOKE. TO ARM WHO WILL NOW -- BE FALSELY TOLD MISLED THAT. INTERPRETERS ARE NOT REQUIRED WHEN IN FACT UNDER FEDERAL LAW THEY ARE -- I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT -- AND ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THE BILL AS OPPOSED BY -- MANY CIVIL RIGHTS IMMIGRANT RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS ARE. DISABILITY RIGHTS DOWN AND LABOR GROUPS AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR NOT NOBLE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. CHRIS RESPONSE WILL ENSURE THAT THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS RESPECTFUL OPPOSITE. NO I BOTTOM ALL REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. BUT WE APPRECIATE THE INTENT. WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. SO WE CONSIDER YOUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CARE CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE'RE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AS WELL AND I JUST LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT THE STAKES. THAT ARE INVOLVED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ARE SIGNIFICANT FOR INDIVIDUALS AND PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WITH A LANGUAGE CHAU LIMITATIONS FOR COURT AND SO THE ISSUES THAT COME BEFORE -- SMALL CLAIMS COURT READ IT FOR LOW INCOME. AND INDIVIDUALS CAN BE -- QUITE DEVASTATING -- TO TO THEIR INTERESTS THE SUPPORT FULL ACCESS -- TO INTERPRETERS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SINGLE BRING IT BACK TO THAT COMMITTEE SO SENATOR AND AND YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THAT THE CONCERNS. WE'RE I THINK THIS IS IN A POINT WHERE. I WAS FOR YOUR BILL TODAY I AM GONNA LEAVE IT TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO FOR FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO ON THIS. ON THIS BILL [inaudible] THAT. BY PASSING THE STATUTE WE DO NOT AT ALL UNDERMINE THE OBLIGATION TO HAVE INTERPRETERS IN COURTROOMS AND THAT THAT IS. AS A CIVIL RIGHT BUT WHAT I'M HOPING THIS BILL DOES IS PROVIDE A BIT OF A FRAMEWORK FOR COURTS TO BE ABLE. TO NAVIGATE THE SITUATION THAT THEY HAVE BECAUSE THEY THEY THE COURT'S ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE INTERPRETED INFORMATION IS AS ACCURATE. AS IT CAN BE AND UNTIL THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE SOARED BY COURT REPORTERS WHICH IS THAT THE IDEAL IN EVERY COURT INCLUDING SMALL CLAIMS ACROSS THE BOARD. WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED OR OR OR ASK? FOR I THINK WE NEED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT FLEXIBILITY TO THE COURTS HAVE BEEN STANDARDS TO FOLLOW ENSURING THAT. INTERPRETIVE SERVER SERVICES ARE HAPPENING AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SORE TRIED OF THREAD THIS AS CAREFULLY AS POSSIBLE AND THAT'S WHY I'M IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL TODAY. BUT THE OPPOSITION RAISES SOME SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND THAT IS HOPEFULLY SOMETHING THAT THROUGH APPROPRIATE FUNDING AND THROUGH APPROPRIATE STANDARDS WE CAN GET. TO AT SOME POINT AND I THINK WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S HAPPENING WHEN WE DEAL COURTS FUNDING IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT. AS THIS BODY HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR A LONG IME FOR COURTS FUNDING AND AS YOU YOURSELF DISCUSSED. THE LEGISLATURE HAS SEEN A REAL INTEREST IN THAT. FORTUNATELY WERE OFTEN IN A POSITION WHERE WE FUND THE COURTS WERE LITERALLY THROWING MONEY OVER THE WALL HOPING THE COURTS YOU CAN DO THE RIGHT THING. WE DON'T AS A SEPARATE COLECO BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE. CONTROL OR THE REPORTING BACK OF OUR EXPECTATIONS WHEN WE FUNDS. ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE. SEVERAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. SOME ALSO BE THOUGH COURTS WILL WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH US ON THE STANDARDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY INTERESTED IN. HOW THE COURT FUNDS THE SERVICES THAT ARE THERE ENSURE THAT WE ARE GETTING? GETTING AS MUCH COVERAGE FOR FOR INTERPRETERS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER CATEGORIES THERE AS WELL SO THAT THEY COURT PROCESS IS AS PREDICTABLE. AS SUPPORTIVE OF THE PEOPLE WHO APPEAR BECAUSE IS STEPHANIE ACCESS TO JUSTICE ISSUE BEFORE THEM. AND ARE ABLE TO THAT TO TRULY RESOLVE THE JUSTICE PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAVE THAT THE COMMUNITIES NEED US. TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE. SO EITHER DRESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AS A AS A PRACTICING ATTORNEY OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SITTING AS A JUDGE PRO TEM. AND COUNTLESS SMALL KID CLAIMS COULD A CASES. AND HAVE HAD. MANY PEOPLE COME BEFORE ME. WITH THEIR CHILDREN SERVING AS INTERPRETERS OR THE BROTHER OF THE SISTER -- I'VE HAD THE OCCASION TO HAVE TO CORRECT [inaudible] THE TRANSLATION. BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE. BUT IF THERE'S SOMEBODY IN CHINESE OR ANY OTHER LANGUAGE I WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT THE TRANSLATION IS ACCURATE. I I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM SO DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED [inaudible] IN OFFICE IN THIS BUDGET. THAT WE ARE ALLOWING A SEGMENT OF OUR SOCIETY. TO NOT HAVE EQUAL AND ADEQUATE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. IT'S JUST CONTINUES TO HAPPEN WE HAVE COUNTIES LIKE SALMON A DINO AND RIVERSIDE WHERE THE COURTROOMS ARE CLOSING DOWN AND WE'RE REQUIRING PEOPLE TO DRIVE. OR TAKE THE BUS OR TO TRAIN FOR AN HOUR AN HOUR AND A HALF TO HAVE ACCESS THAT'S NOT EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE [inaudible] I WHEN I FIRST SAW THE BILL I THOUGHT THIS IS WONDERFUL -- FINALLY SMALL CLAIMS. LITIGANTS WERE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE AN INTERPRETER -- AND THEN WHEN I READ IT FURTHER AND BUT REACHED OUT. TO TO THE PROPONENTS TO YOU REACHED OUT TO OPPOSITION. I REALIZE THAT THERE WERE SO MANY PROBLEMS [inaudible] WITH. SORT OF A THE BANDAID APPROACH SOMETHING THAT'S REQUIRING SURGERY EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE AN INTERPRETER. FOR GORE TO GIVE THEM ACCESS THEY SHOULD HAVE AN INTERPRETER. SO. IT MAKES IT. EVEN EVEN MORE MORE DIFFICULT I TELL YOU THE ONE PART. A OF THE BILL AT THE END AND IT'S IN THE ANALYSIS THE TOP OF PAGE -- THREE G.. SO SO THE COURT WILL GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIND AN INTERPRETER -- IF THEY DON'T FIND AN INTERPRETER THEN THEY WILL TRY TO FIND SOMEONE WHO'S JUST AS GOOD AS AN INTERPRETER. BUT THEN SHE SAYS. IF NO INTERPRETERS APPOINTED THE COURT SHALL FIND AT THAT PROCEEDING WITHOUT AN INTERPRETER. IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE FAIR ADMINISTRATION [inaudible] OF JUSTICE [inaudible] IT'S FRIGHTENING. THAT WE'RE SAYING THAT THERE IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT THAT JUDGE WHOEVER THAT JUDGE MAYBE SOMETIMES WE HAVE GOOD GOOD PLAYERS SOMETIMES WE DON'T. THAT JUDGE IS GOING TO DECIDE CAN GET YOUR INTERPRETER BUT I'M DECIDING THAT WE DON'T NEED AN INTERPRETER LET'S GO FORWARD. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAY I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING. BUT I WILL IN MY INFINITE WISDOM DECIDED THIS IS THIS IS JUSTICE WITH GO FORWARD [inaudible] I I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS I KNOW THAT -- IT'S IT'S IT'S DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING -- THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS POSITION -- DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING. THANK YOU WHAT ELSE [inaudible] RIGHT SEEING NONE. SKINNER WAS SO YOU MAY CLOSE THANKS VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND FIRST OF ALL -- MISTER CHAIRMAN I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN ONE OF THOSE PROPONENTS THAT WORK HARD. SUBMITTING LETTERS AND WORK IN THE BUDGET TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP OUR COURTS OPEN I'VE BEEN ONE OF THOSE MEMBERS AS WELL AND IT'S BEEN. A HANDFUL OF LEGISLATORS THAT HAVE TAKEN THAT POSITION NOT ALL AT AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WHAT BRINGS US TO THIS. THIS POINT TODAY [inaudible] BAD UP. I UNDER ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. SOLUTIONS ARE REALLY HARD TO COME BY. AND I KNOW WHY WE EVEN WORK AND WITH WITH MISTER BAKER -- TO THROUGHOUT THE THE THE THE THE BILL. AND HE WAS ON THAT WORKING COMMITTEE THAT ACTUALLY PROPOSED CEASE AND THESE [inaudible] THIS THIS -- THESE-- FIXES [inaudible] SO [inaudible] I'M OPEN TO AMENDMENTS I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK IN A WAY THAT'S NOT GONNA BRING OUR COURTS TO A HALT. HE HIMSELF ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE ARE MANY. SMALL CLAIMS PROCEEDINGS SAID DON'T HAVE -- CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE INTERPRETER SERVICES AND SOME ARE AT 80% BUT THAT'S NOT A 100% OUR GOAL IS TO GET A HUNDRED TO A 100%. WITHIN THE QUICK CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAPPEN. AT AND I'M I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO GET THERE. BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND WE NEED TO WE NEED A POLICY AND AND THAT WE CAN'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE SOME HAVE ZERO AND SOME HAVE. EIGHTY WE WE NEED TO GET TO AS CLOSE TO A 100% AS WE CAN UNDER UNDER THE UNDER THAT THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE BUT SHORT OF FUNDING THEM APPROPRIATELY WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO. SO THIS I THINK MOVES THE BALL IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IT'S GOING TO GET US TO A 100%. BY BY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT WE WERE ABLE. TO WORKING GOOD FAITH TO PROVIDE. I TOOK BURGER SERVICES WITHOUT NECESSARILY HALTING OUR SYSTEM OR CREATING ADDITIONAL. LITIGATION WITHIN THE SYSTEM THAT COSTS OF COURSE THE COURTS MORE MONEY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE. SO I I APPRECIATE. BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO TO CHECK A PRAGMATIC APPROACH AND WORK WITH ME ON THIS BUT I'M I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS AND WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED THEM UP TO UP TO NOW. TAX AND THAT'S THE THE THE THE REAL SHAME. THAT IF. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO US. WHICH WE SHOULD GET THOSE THOSE SUGGESTIONS IN INTO THIS BILL. BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD WITH WITH THE OPPOSITION ON ON BRIDGING THAT GAP BUT THE THE THE SOLUTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN PROPOSED. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE SUPPORT MEASURE THANK YOU.

AUTHORS AMENDMENTS DISCUSSING COMMUNITIES CLARIFY THAT DISCRIMINATION BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS IS UNLAWFUL IN POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS ADDITIONALLY THERE'S SUPPOSED LANGUAGE TO MAKE CLEAR THAT. NOTHING IN THE ACTUAL BE CONSTRUED TO REQUIRE A POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS OFFER ADMISSION OF OR STUDENT FINANCIAL AID TO A CERTAIN NOT IMMIGRANT FOREIGN STUDENTS. AND WILL TAKE BILLS -- IN COMMITTEE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS WORKED TO ENSURE THAT UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO ATTAIN POST SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE SAME WAY OTHER RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SO.

SIX NINETY ONE WHICH WOULD GUARANTEE EQUAL RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. UNFORTUNATELY. THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON CSU STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE EMIGRATED TO OUR COUNTRY DOCUMENTED OR OTHERWISE. INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO JUST FOCUS ON SCHOOL THOSE STUDENTS HAVE HAD TO COPE WITH THE UNCERTAINTY OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW AND CONSISTENT ATTACKS. FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. EDUCATION. HIGHER EDUCATION IT'S THOUGHT OF AS BEING THE GREAT EQUALIZER A TOOL THAT MAKES SOCIAL MOBILITY POSSIBLE. THIS BENEFIT IS NOT JUST FOR INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS AND ALUMNI BEFORE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVING EDUCATED WORKFORCE IS WHAT PUTS CALIFORNIA OF ALL OTHER STATES. WHICH A STATE HAVE DECIDED THEY'RE PASS LEGISLATION THAT THIS BENEFIT SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO OUR IMMIGRANT. BUT JUST TO OUR IMMIGRANT UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WE WANT THEM TO THRIVE IN COLLEGE JUST LIKE OUR OTHER STUDENTS. BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TASK TO EXPECT ANY STUDENT. AND IN THIS CASE ARE IMMIGRANT STUDENTS TO THRIVE IF THEY'RE WORRIED. ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. S. B. SIX NINETY ONE GIVES THE STUDENTS THE PEACE OF MIND TO KNOW. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL DO WHAT IT CAN TO PREVENT THEIR DISCRIMINATION.

REGARDLESS OF DISABILITY GENDER GENDER IDENTITY GENDER EXPRESSION NATIONALITY RACE OR ETHNICITY RELIGION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. S. B. SIX NINETY ONE WOULD TAKE.

TRAFFIC FLOW THROUGH THE PORTS OF LONG BEACH -- ALLEY AND OAKLAND -- PORTRAITS TRUCK DRIVERS HAVE SOME OF THE HARDEST AND MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IN OUR ECONOMY HOLLY THOSE GOODS AWAY FROM PORTS TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY TO STORES ACROSS AMERICA. BILL OF THESE JOBS ARE MORE ARE MADE EVEN HARDER BY THE MISS CLASSIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WAIT STAFF ANY LEGAL DEDUCTIONS THAT LEAVE PORTRAYS DRIVERS IN THE CYCLE OF POVERTY. THE EXPLOITATION IS SO RAMPANT FREE THE STATE LABOR COMMISSIONER HAS WON MORE THAN FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN JUDGMENTS FOR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED DUCK DRIVERS NO HIGHER COURT HAS EVER OVERTURNED ANY OF THESE AWARD APPEALS. YET THESE JUDGMENTS RARELY MATERIALIZE AND WORKERS RARELY MADE WHOLE AND THIS IS IN PART BECAUSE PORTAL AGE MORE CARRIERS QUITE A BUSINESS. TO AVOID PAYING THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND TURN UP UNDER A NEW NAME. S. B. FOURTEEN THE TO ORDER THAT OUR DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. TO CREATE A LIST OF COMPANIES WITH FINAL JUDGMENTS FOR LABOR VIOLATIONS INCLUDING WAIT STAFF PHILLY FAILURE TO PAY TAXES ANY LEGAL DEDUCTIONS. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO HOLD RETAILERS AND SHIPPERS LIABLE WHEN -- THE USE OF MOTOR CARRIERS ON THIS LIST AFTER MUCH WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I HAVE MADE SEVERAL AMENDMENTS. THAT ADDRESS OPPOSITIONS CONCERNED ALLOWING FOR A NINETY DAY PERIOD FOR A CUSTOMER TO TERMINATE AN EXISTING AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY ON THE WEBSITE. OR THE END OF THE CONTRACT WHICHEVER IS SHORTER THIS INSURERS INSURERS DELIVERIES ARE NOT AFFECTED -- DURING BUSY SHIPPING TIMES AT ALSO ESTABLISHING A REGULAR REGULAR FREQUENCY OF UPDATES OF THE WEBSITE BY THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT.

THANK YOU WINSTON SUPPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS VERY BROAD AND BEHALF THE TEAMSTERS CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. ON AS THE OLD SAYING GOES JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED [inaudible] AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT IN THE PORT AREA THIS IS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR DECADES. SO LARGELY IMMIGRANT WORK FORCE ADEN THAT ARE TOLD THAT THEY ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THEY DON'T GO INTO THE TRUCKING. THEY DON'T HOLD OPERATING AUTHORITY THEY DON'T HAVE BUSINESS LICENSES THEY DON'T HAVE THEY OWNER THEY OWN A TRUCK TRACTOR ITSELF THAT OFTENTIMES THE LEAST FROM THESE TRUCKING COMPANIES CREATING A KIND OF DEBT BONDAGE ACTUATION IT'S REALLY BAD [inaudible] BOB. YEAH I WAS SENATOR POINTED OUT THERE HAVE BEEN. HUNDREDS OF JUDGMENTS AGAINST THESE COMPANIES THERE'S AT LAST WE LOOKED TWO HUNDRED AND SIX TRUCKING COMPANIES WITH UNPAID UNSATISFIED FINAL JUDGMENT ON THE OWING FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IT'S GONE UP A LITTLE AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE AMOUNT IS [inaudible] FOR JUDGMENTS TEEN BY PRIVATE COUNSEL. ON OR JUDGMENTS THAT ARE OWED. TO THE STATE AS TAX LIENS FOR FAILURE TO PAY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TAX ETCETERA. FAILURE TO PROVIDE WORKERS COMPENSATION AND SO FORTH SO IT COULD BE MUCH BIGGER. WHAT THIS DOES IS IT CREATES A SITUATION WHERE TRUCKING COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING ADHERE TO THE LAW CANNOT COMPETE. IT AND SO THE COMPETITION IS A RACE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ILLEGALITY. ON WHAT WE REALIZED IS THAT WE HAD TO INVOLVE THE SHIPPER. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT. TROLL FOR TRANSPORTATION. AND IT'S BEEN TOO EASY FRANKLY FOR THEM TO JUST. LOOK THE OTHER WAY OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND WAS SHOCKED SHOCKED THAT SUCH CONDUCT IS OCCURRING. NO GAMBLING IS OCCURRING IN OUR CASINO THAT SORT OF RESPONSE AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE IT'S NOT THEIR BUSINESS IN A IN A CERTAIN SENSE BUT IT'S WHAT WE NOW HAVE TO DO IS MAKE IT. THEIR BUSINESS [inaudible] THIS BILL. CREATES JOINT LIABILITY. ONLY AND I I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW HARD YOU WOULD HAVE TO WORK AS A SHIPPER TO GET JOINT LIABILITY. A TRUCKING COMPANY APPEARS ON THIS LIST WITH A FINAL ON APPEALABLE JUDGMENT. IF YOU THEN. CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS WITH THAT TRUCKING COMPANY. AND ONLY THEN IF THE TRUCKING COMPANY VIOLATES THE LAW SUBSEQUENTLY NOT FOR THEIR PAST CONDUCT BUT SUBSEQUENTLY WHILE THEY ARE. CARRYING FREIGHT FOR YOU. YOU ARE LIABLE FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME JOINTLY LIABLE FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME. THAT YOU CARRY THAT FREIGHT SO ANY SHIPPER. WITH A SHIPPING CLERK THAT LOOKS AT THIS THIS LIST ONCE A MONTH CAN AVOID COMPLETELY AVOID JOINT LIABILITY BY TELLING A TRUCKING COMPANY WERE TERMINATING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU. WE'RE NOT GONNA HIRE YOU I TO GET YOURSELF OFF THE LIST MAGNITUDE ROCCA I'M SORRY SO -- THE BILL FOR US I APOLOGIZE. HE'S A MUCH ANYWAY WE URGENT YE VOTE WE THINK THIS IS UNFAIR BILL WE REMOVE THE OPPOSITION FROM THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. WE WORKED WITH THE OPPONENTS AND ON WE URGE DRIVE UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT HIS PLEASE. YES GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CLARK HERMAN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE TOLL GROUP -- TOLD GROUP OPERATES A COMPREHENSIVE GLOBAL LOGISTICS THAT WORK ACROSS TWELVE HUNDRED LOCATIONS IN MORE THAN FIFTY COUNTRIES. WERE SUBSIDIARY OF JAPAN POST -- WE GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED THAT OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET IS OUR EMPLOYEES AND WE TAKE THE SAME APPROACH HERE IN THE U. S. -- WHERE WE OPERATE EXTENSIVELY ON BOTH THE EAST COAST AND WEST COAST PARTICULARLY IN THE PORTS OF LONG BEACH AND LOS ANGELES -- WE HAVE -- WE OPERATE IN THE TRADE MARKET IN THAT WAY IT WON'T REACH FOR OVER TEN YEARS WE CURRENTLY EMPLOY OVER EIGHTY DRIVERS WERE TRYING TO SIGNIFICANTLY GROW OUR BUSINESS. CONSISTENT WITH OUR CORPORATE VALUES WE OPERATE AN ASSET BUSINESS MODEL WITH EMPLOYEE DRIVERS WE ALSO HAVE ADOPTED A SET OF CORPORATE PRINCIPLES. THAT INCLUDES WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH TRADE UNIONS OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE WE OPERATE. IN THE U. S. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS. THE TRADE MARKET IS VERY VERY COMPETITIVE AS THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED. EIGHT HUNDRED COMPANIES AND ACTS ACCESO A HUNTER COPPED A COMPANIES OPERATING JUST IN THE PORTS OF LA LONG BEACH. IT IS A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE CHALLENGES ARE MADE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT WHEN WE MUST COMPETE WITH A VAST ARRAY OF TRUCKING COMPANIES THAT DO NOT ABIDE BY THE SAME RULES. UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS THAT MANY COMPANIES WE COMPETE AGAINST-OPERATE UNDER AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BUSINESS MODEL THAT RUNS AFOUL OF CALIFORNIA LABOR LAWS. RESULTING IN UNACCEPTABLE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR MANY PORT DRIVERS WHO CANNOT EARN A LIVING WAGE. IT ISN'T THIS HEARTENING THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS FOR THAT YOUR AGENT HISTORY TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA'S LABOR LAWS. WE DO NOT MISS CLASSIFY OUR DRIVERS WE OPERATE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE CONFINES OF CALIFORNIA LAW. WHAT TOLL AND OTHER COMPANIES WITH AN ASSET BASE MODEL WHO EMPLOY DRIVERS IN THE JURY'S INDUSTRY WANT AND WHAT THE MARKETS WANT? IS A FAIR AND LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. WHERE THE RULES ARE CLUES PARA CLEARLY DELINEATED WITH THE REFEREES ARE CONFIDENT AND WHERE WE KNOW THAT THE GAME IS NOT RIGGED? THE PLAYING FIELD IN THE TRADE INDUSTRY IS CURRENTLY CURRENTLY OPERATING ON A DISTORTED SLOPE WHERE COMPANIES LIKE TOLLS ARE AT A LOSS BLOWOUT LOWER AND STRUGGLING TO CAN MEET. AGAINST ARTIFICIALLY LOW LABOR COSTS IN SPITE OF OUR BEST EFFORTS THE STATE CANNOT ENFORCE THE CURRENT REGULATORY SCHEME. THE SLACK OF ENFORCEMENT IN A FACTORY IT'S AN ILLEGAL SUBSIDY TO COMPANIES THAT OPERATE OUTSIDE THE LAW. AND RELEVANT COURT DECISIONS THIS IS. POSITION IN OUR VIEW. THERE IS LABOR INSTABILITY IN THE PORTS IN THE FORM OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS INFREQUENT WORK STOPPAGES. DUE TO THE FACT THAT HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES ARE CONTINUING TO OPERATE ILLEGITIMATELY IN THE DRAINAGE MARKETPLACE. THIS INSTABILITY PREVENTS LEGITIMATE DRAINAGE COMPANIES SUCH AS TALL FROM OPERATING ITS BUSINESSES EFFICIENTLY. WE AN OTHER DRAINAGE COMPANIES SUPPORT THIS BILL RESPECTFULLY ASK TO SEE. THE STATE TO ADOPT THIS LEGISLATION WHICH CREATE A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE TRADES INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. IN WHICH ETHICAL COMPANIES SUCH AS TALL ARE ALLOWED TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THE PORTS OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING TURN NUMBERS NUCLEAR CREDIT WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN NO TO ALL BE BRIEF. AN RTC STANDS AT THE THOUSANDS OF MISCLASSIFIED PORT RAGE TRUCK DRIVERS NOT ONLY TO CORRECT THIS AGREE JUST PRACTICE OF LABOR EXPLOITATION.

AND THE WEBSITE TO START IF I MAY WITH A TWENTY SIX THAT WORKS THAT'S OUR ITEM NUMBER FIVE THERE'S A MOTION I WILL SECOND THAT THANK YOU -- WITH THE MOTION AYE WONDERS AYE MY GETTING A MESSAGE I SHOULD MAKE IT SHORT AND SWEET -- BUT LET ME JUST. INDICATE TO YOU AND TO THE MEMBERS. WELL I THINK IT'S JUST A JUST A FEW OF US ARE RIGHT NOW YESTERDAY SO -- BUT FOR FOR ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED THIS IS. A I THINK A A REALLY. CRITICAL TIME I IN A CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY -- TO START OPENING UP ONE OF THE LAST BASTIONS OF WHITE MALE DOMINATION AND THAT IS THE C. SUITE. AND OUR CORPORATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO AND IN THIS COUNTRY -- THERE ARE OTHER NATIONS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY REQUIRE WOMEN ON CORPORATE BOARDS. THEY DO SO BECAUSE WOMEN ADD TREMENDOUS A BENEFIT TO COMPANIES IN TERMS OF PROFITABILITY PRODUCTIVITY INNOVATION. A WORKPLACE -- OF HARMONY IF YOU WERE. AND THE RESEARCH IS VERY CLEAR -- THAT. FOR WHATEVER REASONS AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT CAUSATION AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT CLEARLY HAVING WOMEN HAVING 52% OF THE POPULATION REPRESENTED ON CORPORATE BOARDS WHEN WOMEN REPRESENT. 70% OF THE CONSUMERS I IS A GOOD THING AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT. OF BEEN ABLE TO MOVE THAT A NEEDLE AT ALL. WITH THE RESOLUTION I DID A FEW YEARS AGO URGING COMPANIES ARE TO ADD WOMEN TO THEIR CORPORATE BOARDS AND WE MADE. A NO PROGRESS WITH THAT THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WILL REQUIRE. THAT -- IF A BOOK BY TWENTY NINETEEN THE BOARD HAS TO HAVE A WOMAN ON IT IT BEING STUD THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KICK ANYBODY OFF THAT YOU WILL ADD A POSITION WE BELIEVE THAT THAT. SATISFIES FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION -- IT'S NOT CLEAR WHERE THIS WOULD OR WOULDN'T GO BUT I THINK IT'S A WORTHY ENOUGH LEGISLATION THAT WE SHOULD. A FORCE OF FORCED THE A DISCUSSION AND IF IT DOES END UP IN THE CALL COURTS MAKE THAT DECISION BUT CLEARLY WOMEN HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN CORPORATE AMERICA FOR FAR TOO LONG. AYE IT'S TIME WE CHANGE THAT WE KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ADD WOMEN TO PORTS THAT THE CULTURE CHANGES AND IT IS TIME WE CHANGE THE CULTURE WHETHER IT'S FOR PROFITABILITY WHETHER IT IS TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- WHETHER IT IS -- TO IMPROVE THE INNOVATIVE -- QUALITIES AVE PARTICULAR COMPANY THIS IS A WAY TO GET THEIR AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A MEASURE -- THAT WILL MOVE THE BALL FORWARD AND BE BENEFICIAL NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF EQUITY BUT IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS AND TO THE BENEFIT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL. AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK YOUR ARRIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING AT THANKS TO HOSPITAL MORNING BETSY BURKE OF WORK READ AIR I AM PAST PRESIDENT OF NOVEL CALIFORNIA NATIONAL ASSOCIATION WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS I OWN A RETAINED EXECUTIVE SEARCH FIRM IN LOS ANGELES. WHERE WE'VE DONE MANY BOARD SEARCHES OVER THE YEARS AND I'M ALSO CEO OF TWENTY TWENTY WOMEN ON BOARDS WHICH IS A CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE AND COLLABORATE WITH COMPANIES TO HELP THEM FIND MORE WOMEN? FOR CORPORATE BOARDS THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH HERE IS THE PROBLEM OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND. THERE ARE MANY IN FACT THOUSANDS OF QUALIFIED WOMEN NOT ONLY EXECUTIVE EXPERIENCE WOMEN BUT THOSE WHO'VE BEEN CERTIFIED BY UCLA BY STANFORD AND OTHER OF THE INSTITUTIONS OUTSIDE OR CALIFORNIA BORDERS. BUT WHO HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED AS QUALIFIED FOR SERVING ON CORPORATE BOARDS AND THEY ALSO PAID BUT THE SIGNIFICANT MONEY FOR THAT CERTIFICATION. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE TOO FEW SEATS. ON CORPORATE BOARDS AND THE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OPENINGS ARE RARE A CORPORATION MIGHT HAVE A AN OPENING EVERY FIVE YEARS DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN. BUT THERE'S A WAVE OF RETIREMENTS CHO BECAUSE BABY BOOMER MEN AND WOMEN WHO'VE BEEN ON PORTS FOR TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS ARE RETIRING AS WE KNOW BABY BOOMERS ARE RETIRING IN DROVES. RIGHT NOW IN IN ALL IN NO INDUSTRIES AND FUNCTIONS SO THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE OPENINGS WE WANT TO WITH THIS BILL MAKE SURE THAT THE OPENINGS ARE. A ALLOWED TO BRING IN WOMEN. AND ALSO THE PROBLEM WITH THE BUCK CORPORATE BOARD SEATS AS YOU MAY KNOW. THAT -- AND WE KNOW IN THE SEARCH BUSINESS THAT THE CANDIDATES CONSIDERED IF THERE'S NOTA COMPETITION LIKE A JOB. LINED UP FOR YOU LINE UP THE BEST CANDIDATES IN THE BEST ONE IS CHOSEN THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS. THE BOARD'S NOMINATING COMMITTEE GIVES US SEARCH FIRMS A LIST OF FIVE TO SEVEN POTENTIAL CANDIDATES THEY KNOW AND LIKE AND FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH. AND THEN THEY HAVE SEARCH FIRMS WEATHER'S KORN FERRY SPENCER STUART BURKE AMER CLAYTON THEY HAVE SEARCH FIRMS VET THOSE CANDIDATES ABOUT THEIR BACKGROUNDS AT CEDRAS. AND ABOUT THE OF ANY ERA BOARDS THEY'VE SERVED ON IN THE PAST ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED AND THEN WE BRING A REPORT BACK TO THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE AND THEY DECIDE WHICH ONE PERSON. THEY'RE GOING TO INTERVIEW THEY DON'T INTERVIEW THREE OR FOUR THE ONLY INTERVIEW ONE AND IF THAT IF ALL WORKS OUT IN AREN'T ANY CONFLICTS OF DATES. THAT PERSON IS BROUGHT ON THE BOARD IT'S AMANDA AND MOST LIKELY OF NOAH ANGLO MAN BECAUSE THAT IS WHO THE OTHER CEOS ON THE BOARD ALREADY KNOW AND TRUST AND FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH. SO IT'S JUST A ILLOGICAL THING THAT HAS ENDED UP WITH SORT OF DE FACTO DISCRIMINATION. SO FOR YOUR JUDICIARY PURPOSES WE'VE HAD DATA INPUT BY LEGAL COUNSEL AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE COURTS AND HERE IN THE COMMITTEE RAPPER. I SHALL THAT WE NEED TO PROVE AND WE KNOW WE CAN A COMPELLING INTEREST FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO PROVE THAT THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DOCTRINE DOES NOT MATTER COUNT IN THIS AREA. AND NUMBER THREE THAT FOR CONSTITUTIONALITY AND EQUAL PROTECTION BY THE LAW THAT WEEKEND APPROVE STRICT SCRUTINY WITH ALL OF THE OTHER -- EFFORTS THAT WE'VE TRIED TO BRING FORWARD FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO IMPROVE INCLUDING THE RESOLUTION THAT THE SENATOR PUT FORWARD FIVE YEARS AGO. AND THAT WE CAN PROVE THAT THE THAT THE SELECTION PROCESS AND THE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS NARROWLY TAILORED. SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST GENDER THAT IS THE QUALIFIER FOR PUTTING THOSE THAT CANDIDATE WOMEN ON THE BOARD IT IS ALL THE OTHER OF EXPERIENCE THAT THEY HAVE IN FUNCTIONAL CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT ON THAT CORPORATE BOARD. SO WITH THAT I SAY THANK YOU SENATOR AND I ALSO WANTED TO COMPLEMENT YOUR STAFF BECAUSE THEY DID A GREAT JOB ON A VERY COMPLICATED TOPIC. A OUTLINING WHAT THE POTENTIAL ISSUES MIGHT BE THANK THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR AND MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU -- FOR HEARING US TODAY MY NAME DALY SAID BARRETT I'M A PROFESSOR OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO AND I HAVE CONDUCTED RESEARCH ON CORPORATE BOARDS IN ADVISED CORPORATE BOARD MEMBERS AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ON BOARD EFFECTIVENESS IMPORT COMPETITION FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS NOW. I CONDUCTED THE STUDY OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES AND THE PREVALENCE OF FEMALE DIRECTORS ON THOSE BOARDS AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH ANY STATISTICS THAT YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN AND ASKING ABOUT -- THE OVERALL GIST IS THAT -- HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NO WOMEN ON THEIR BOARDS AND AMONG ALL THE CORPORATE DIRECTORS SERVING ON THE BOARDS OF CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS ONLY. FIFTEEN FIFTEEN POINT 5% OF THEM ARE FEMALE COMPARED 216% ACROSS THE NATION SO WHERE BEHIND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY ON THIS ISSUE -- AND WE HOPE THAT CALIFORNIA WILL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD ON THIS ISSUE INSTEAD -- THIS BILL IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO POINT OUT I FEEL THAT THE BILL AND APPLIES ONLY TO PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES AND COMPANIES THAT HAVE. GONE THROUGH THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING PROCESS AND TAKEN ON CAPITAL FROM THE INVESTING PUBLIC. IN TURN HAVE AN OBLIGATION. THEY HAVE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE ESTABLISHED BY CORPORATE LAW INCLUDING DISCLOSURE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. THE NEEDS OF THE INVESTING PUBLIC OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THERE CAN THEIR COMPANY OPERATES AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE YOUR CONSTITUENTS -- AND SO I CAN GO INTO MANY DETAILS ON ANY POLICIES AND PRACTICES BUT I WON'T IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE REGARDING STATISTICS PORT BOARD PRACTICES AS WE GO THROUGH DISCUSSION THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND PLEASE. WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE LOOKED THANK YOU BLESSEDNESS WAYS. THANK YOU OF KAREN AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS AND STAINS I AM PRESIDENT OF NOVEL CALIFORNIA REPRESENT THE TWELVE CHAPTERS OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS ACROSS THE STATE. AND A BY PROXY THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS ACROSS THE STATE NOVEL IS THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AND IT IS BECAUSE WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS ARE QUALIFIED -- THERE ARE MANY MANY WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE QUALIFIED TO SERVE ON BOARDS BUT THE DOORS ARE CLOSED FOR EVEN CONSIDERATION FOR THE MOST PART AS YOU'VE SEEN -- THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING THOUGH THE I'M THE AND BILL THAT WAS PASSED OR VIA. WHAT IS ILLUSION THE RESOLUTION THAT WAS PASSED HAD NO EFFECT AND IT IS TIME THAT WOMEN BE CONSIDERED FOR THESE ROLES? IF YOU EVEN CONSIDER THAT 1% OF THE WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA COULD BE QUALIFIED -- THAT WOULD BE WELL MORE THAN WOULD BE NEEDED TO FILL THE SUN EVEN A HALF OF A PERCENT. A WOULD BE WELL MORE THAN WOULD BE NEEDED SO WE URGE YOUR VOTE PLEASE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. FEEDSGIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION YES ARC AFTERNOON GORE GOOD MORNING LAURIE CAMERON BEHALF OF SMALL BUSINESS CALIFORNIA'S FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS INCLUDING MANY MANY WOMEN WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU.

SING NONE THEIR OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE HERE AND IN OPPOSE POSITION ON S. B. EIGHT TWENTY SIX WHILE WE DO AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE INTENT OF THE BILL WHICH IS TO CREATE MORE DEBATE. DIVERSITY I AM FOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS WE DISAGREE IN THE MANNER IN WHICH AB ARE S. B. EIGHT TWENTY SIX AND SIX TO ACCOMPLISH ITS GOAL GENDER IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF DIVERSITY. AND W. M. WHILE WE WANT TO PROTECT OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS RECOGNIZED UNDER THE LAWS AND REGARDING DIVERSITY AND WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL WOULD POTENTIALLY PUT GENDER. AND ELEVATED AS A PRIORITY OVER OTHER ASPECTS OF DIVERSITY AND CALIFORNIA CONCEPT EDITION WE HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES ON CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION STATES THAT A PERSON MAY NOT BE DISQUALIFIED FROM ENTERING OR PURSUING A BUSINESS. PROFESSION VOCATION OR EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF SEX RACE CREED COLOR NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ETHICS. AND AND ARE CONCERNED WITH THIS IS THAT IT COULD POTENTIALLY DISPLACED WELL WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUTHOR HAS ALLOWED FOR ADDITIONAL SPACES TO BE ON BOARDS AND IT DOES REQUIRE THAT ALMOST 50% FOR A REPORT WOULD HAVE. OF 50% OR MORE OF WOMEN ON THE BORDER SORRY AND IF THERE'S THREE THEN AT LEAST I'M ONE AND AND THAT IF THEY'RE SAD FOR THE AT LEAST. TWO SO IN SOME INSTANCES 50% AND ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL BOARD PLACEMENT AND WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE DISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED MALES I'M AND OTHER M. ETHNIC ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE HAVE OF UP A PLACE AT THE BOARD. AND ADDITIONALLY BY WAY OF EXAMPLE I'M HERE TODAY THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ALONE ARE NOT 50% FEMALE AND AGAIN THIS IS BY WAY OF EXAMPLE JUST TO SHOW HOW HARD THESE KIND OF THINGS ARE. AND WE WOULD BE IMPOSING SOMETHING ON THE PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT AND THE LEGISLATURE THEMSELVES CAN ON IT AND ATTAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

AGREES THE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES BUT YET PART OF OUR ROLE IS TO PUSH THE DIALOGUE FOR DEBT CERTAINLY THIS. BILL SHOULD PASS AND I HOPE IT DOES WOULD RECEIVE STRICT SCRUTINY BUT I THINK THERE'S DEFTLY COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IN THIS. AND FOR THE COURTS TO TAKE A A VERY CLOSE LOOK IT IS. THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OVERCOME WHAT HAS REALLY BEEN LONG STANDING DISCRIMINATION THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS THAT'S PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PUT OPPORTUNITIES FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN FACT ADDRESSING. DISCRIMINATION AS WE SEE IT AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT. TO RE INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT OUR GOALS AS A STATE ARE MATT AND SO I FEEL THAT THIS IS BILLS ABSOLUTELY WORTHY OF OUR SUPPORT TODAY. I HOPE THIS COMMITTEE WILL PASS IT OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CUSHION WITH THAT [inaudible] JERRY MIKLOS. I WILL ADOPT THE STATEMENT OF THE CHAIR AND WITH THAT ASKS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. KALRA PLEASE STONE AYE STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM [inaudible] CHAU [inaudible] CHIU HOLDEN [inaudible] KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN REYES. REYES AYE GABRIEL. CURRENTLY THE VOTERS THREE TO ONCE WILL PUT THAT BELONG CALL YOU MISTER. THANK YOU TENDER. SO ITEM NUMBER TEN S. B.. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR GOOD MORNING STILL I THINK AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I AM PRESENTING TODAY S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WHICH IS A A BILL TO FIGHT PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA. BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO PAY EQUITY YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW. AND A FEW YEARS AGO RECOGNIZING THAT PAID DISCRIMINATION IS HARD TO DETECT AND ADDRESS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED A REVISION. TWO A DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT THAT LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS. THE EMPLOYER INFORMATION REPORT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE E. OUT. ONE AND IT TO ARE CALLED UPON -- OR ADDED TO A WAS ABOUT TO ADD TO THIS -- REPORT OTHER REPORTING A PAY DATA BY RACE AND GENDER BEGINNING IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT IN AUGUST OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUT A HALT TO THIS IMPORTANT PAY DATA -- BECAUSE SO THAT THAT EMPLOYERS BY THE WAY WERE ALL PLOY HOUSTON PREPARED TO START REPORTING. S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS HAVE A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OR MORE IN CALIFORNIA. TO SUBMIT A PAID DATA REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION IN HOURS WORKED OF EMPLOYEES BY GENDER RACE ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY. NOT INDIVIDUALLY BUT BY CATEGORY. AND THE GOAL IS TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION. PUT A MIRROR IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE AND SEE WHAT YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING THAT IS THE INTENT OF THIS BILL THAT IS THE GOAL. A IT IS NOT TO SHAME -- IT IS TO SIMPLY REQUIRE A SHELF OF VALUATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE. A DISCRIMINATING AND OFTENTIMES I BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THAT DISCRIMINATION IS UNINTENDED YOU JUST DON'T KNOW. BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED MAYBE DON'T WANNA LOOK BUT THIS WILL REQUIRE THAT YOU DO LOOK AND IT WILL ALSO ALLOW -- DIR INDIA FEE H. TOGETHER IMPORTANT DATA THAT ALLOWS HIM TO SEE IT PATTERNS OF WAGE DISPARITIES AND IF THEY NOTICED DEVIATIONS OR OUT LIARS TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER. SO AS I MENTIONED THIS IS NOT A BILL ABOUT PUBLIC SHAMING THAT WAS A BILL THAT. WE HEARD AND ACTUALLY WENT TO THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR A BECAUSE AT THAT IS NOT WHAT MY GOAL IS MY GOAL IS TO GET PEOPLE TO COMPLY IS TO GET COMPANIES TO COMPLY. AND WE'VE EVEN EXEMPTED A THIS DATA FROM BEING ACCESSED THROUGH A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT TO CONFIRM THAT THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SAY HEY I GOTCHA. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO GET COMPANIES TO COMPLY. SO I HAVE WITH ME TODAY SHANNON SMITH CRAWLEY WITH THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN AND RICO YOSHIHARA WITH CALIFORNIAN PLACEMENT LAWYERS. A TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS MICHAEL YOSHIHARA WITH THAT CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD TO COSPONSOR THIS BILL ALONG WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN A YOU W.. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SENATOR JACKSON A LOT OF OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO TACKLE THE GENDER AND RACE WAGE GAP. ON THAT BUT DESPITE ALL THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE AND STRENGTHENING OUR EQUAL PAY LAWS THE GENDER AND RACE WAGE GAP OR JUST NOT CLOSING FAST ENOUGH. AND ONE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WAGE DISPARITIES IS NOT JUST NOT JUST ABOUT COMPARING TO WORKERS DOING THE SAME JOB AND THEY'RE DIFFERENT GENDERS ARE DIFFERENT RACES -- BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION WHERE WE'RE SEEING HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES MINORITIES AND LOWER PAID JOBS. AND THIS CAN BE THE RESULT OF UNFAIR PAY BE THE RESULT OF UNCONSCIOUS BIAS DISCRIMINATORY HIRING APARTMENT PROMOTION PRACTICES. ON BUT WE ALSO SEE OF THE OFTENTIMES EMPLOYERS ARE JUST UNAWARE THAT THESE WAGE DISPARITIES EXIST OR THAT THERE IS THIS OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE GRANULAR PAY DATA OR THE HIGH LEVEL. PATTERNS WITHIN WITHIN THEIR WHOLE THEIR OWN PAY AND WITHIN THEIR OWN PAY DATA. AND THIS IS WHY THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THE EEOC UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED THIS REVISION TO THE EO ONE REPORTS OF THAT THEY GET. HOW THESE EMPLOYERS COMPILE ALL THIS DATA HOW ABOUT HIGH LEVEL LOOK TO SEE IF THERE ARE? PAY PATTERNS THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED -- AND IT'S WORTH NOTING IN EMPHASIZING THAT THE EEOC ADOPTED THIS -- THIS REVISED FORM AFTER OVER TWO YEARS OF A RIGOROUS AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS INCLUDING A PUBLIC HEARING A PILOT STUDY A VOTE BY THE EEOC COMMISSIONERS TWO ROUNDS OF NOTICE AND PUBLIC COMMENT. CONSULTATIONS WITH EMPLOYER REPRESENTATIVES AGE ARE EXPERTS AND NUMEROUS STUDIES -- SO THROUGH THIS EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF THE EEOC DETERMINED. A A METHOD OF PAY DATA REPORTING THAT WAS SIMPLE. AND WOULD NOT UNDULY BURDEN EMPLOYERS WHILE STILL PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT COULD AGAIN UNCOVERED THESE UNFAIR PAY PRACTICES. I SENATOR JACKSON POINTED OUT THIS WILL HELP EMPLOYER SELF CORRECTING AND IT WILL ALSO HELP OUR STATE AGENCIES WITH TARGETED ENFORCEMENT OF OF OUR PAY DISCRIMINATION LAWS. AND ALSO OUR STATE AGENCIES TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT PAY PATTERNS WITHIN AND ACROSS DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND ACROSS AND WITHIN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH -- TO JUST CONTINUE FOLLOWING THIS IMPORTANT WORK THAT THE EEOC WAS DOING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. STRONGLY URGE DRIVE THOUGH. CHAIRMAN SMITH CROWLEY REPRESENTING AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN A CO SPONSOR. OF THE AND LIKE TO LYING MYSELF WITH OF THE COMMENTS OF THE CALL MY COLLEAGUE -- ONE REASON WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO KEEP COMING BACK WITH A DIFFERENT BILLS THAT WE COME UP HAD OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. IS THAT ACTUALLY THE PAY GAP IS WIDENING. UP UNTIL THIS YEAR WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE FIFTEEN YEARS TO CLOSE. THE CURRENT DATA SAYS A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS. SO WE NEED TO HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TOOLS IN OUR ARSENAL. THIS ONE ACTUALLY MIGHT MIND. I'M CHANGING YOU KNOW WATCHING THAT I USE BEFORE I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THIS IS. THE SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY. SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY DOES NOT TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE CANCER. IT TELLS YOUR YOU KNOW WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AREA A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY DO SOME MORE INVESTIGATION. AND DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU FIND TO LOOK AT ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF OF TESTING. SO REALLY IT'S IN AS THE SENATOR SAID. GIVING PEOPLE GIVING ORGANIZATIONS A CHANCE TO EVEN RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES. OF WHAT THEY'RE ISSUES -- THAT THEY MAY HAVE A PROBLEM THEY MAY HAVE A PROBLEM IT DOESN'T SAY THEY DO. IT MAY BE SOMETHING LIKE JOB SEGREGATION -- DATA SHOW REPORT SHOW ONLY ABOUT OF THE PAY DISPARITY IS BASED ON BIAS OR DISCRIMINATION. SO THE REST OF IT IS THE STATUS QUO THEY'RE USED TO DOING THIS THEY HAVEN'T CHECKED IN SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A VALUABLE TOOL AND WE ASK YOUR SUPPORT THE BILL. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. APPROACH STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR ORGANIZATION. AND MY CHILD ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING LORD CURTIS SUMMING UP FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO SP TWELVE EIGHTY FOREIGN IT'S ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE JOB KILLER BILL THIS YEAR. OUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THE BILL AGAIN AND THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SUPPORTED THE FAIR PACKED IN THE AND BEFORE AND WAS PASSED AND WE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE AUTHOR. ON THAT BILL IN ORDER TO TRY AND ACHIEVE AND PAY QUALITY OTHER CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL ARE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT MAY NOT BE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT BUT LOOKING AT THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. THERE IS STILL PUBLIC SHAMING ASPECT WE HAVE ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHOR AND HAVE PROVIDED AMENDMENTS TO PART WHICH IF ADDRESSED OUR WHICH IF TAKEN WE BELIEVE WELL I AM ALLOW FOR THIS TO NO LONGER BE SUCH AN ISSUE. BUT THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE BILL SAYS THAT IT WOULD BE UNLAWFUL FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO RELEASE THE SLIP AT THIS -- INFORMATION PRIOR TO LITIGATION WHICH MEANS AGAIN WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE INTENT BUT ONCE A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS FILED IN THIS INFORMATION COULD BE TURNED OVER SO WE ASK THAT THAT BE TIGHTENED. WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'VE ADDED THE PRIVATE RIGHT OR ACT EXEMPTION WE APPRECIATE THAT BUT WE HAVE BIG CONCERNS ABOUT -- FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION BEING FILE BECAUSE WE DO KNOW HOW LITIGIOUS CALIFORNIA'S AND ADDITIONALLY THIS GOES STILL TO THE INFORMATION I AM SHOWING WAGE DISPARITY RIGHT I MEAN YOU HAVE YOU CAN HAVE LAWFUL WHICH DISPARITY INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE. DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND HAVE. BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON BONA FIDE FACTORS AND WE'RE CONCERNED THIS AGGREGATE DATA IS SIMPLY GOING TO SHOW WHICH DISPARITY THAT MIGHT NOT BE UNLAWFUL AND AGAIN IF THIS INFORMATION BY ANY MEANS AS PER AS ALLOWED TO BE PUBLIC. THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE HEADLINES WHERE THIS COMPANY IT DOES NOT PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES FAIRLY AND THAT'S OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WITH THAT ISSUE AND ADDITIONALLY IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOME IF IT THIS INFORMATION ANYWAY WERE TO GET OUT THERE COULD BE SOME POTENTIAL THAT. INDIVIDUAL'S PRIVATE INFORMATION IS NOW OUT THERE FOR EXAMPLE I'M JUST TO GIVE A VERY BROAD AND HYPOTHETICAL IF YOU SAW THAT THE JOB TITLE WITH QUARTERBACK AND I KNOW THIS ISN'T ONE ON THE E. ONE FAR BUT IF YOU SAW THAT JOB TITLES QUARTERBACK AND YOU KNOW THAT. THEY'RE PLAYING FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO FORTY NINERS YOU CAN PROBABLY AN AND IDENTIFY WHO THAT INDIVIDUAL IS SO THE UP ONE INDIVIDUAL UNDER ONE JOB TITLE AND THIS INFORMATION OR TO GET OUT THE NOT INDIVIDUALS PRIVATE PAY I'M INFORMATION WILL BE OUT THERE FOR THE WORLD TO SEE. SO THOSE ARE CONCERNS AND AGAIN WE WE APPRECIATE WORK AND THE OTHER ON THIS BUT AS THE BILL STANDS TODAY AND IS A CONCERNS BILL FOR US IN A JOB KILLER FOR CALVERT CHAMBER COMMERCE. MISTER CHAIR CHRIS MCKAY WE ON THE OTHER COUNTY AND CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION WE DID WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH SENATOR JACKSON HONOR SENATE BILL. THREE FIFTY A DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE SUBDIVISION J. WHICH MISS CURTIS REFERENCE WHICH IS THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT -- EXEMPTION. THE CLAUSE IN SUBDIVISION I A ONE OF THE TWO ITEMS THAT -- CONTINUES TO BE OF CONCERN AND THAT IS THE LANGUAGE ABOUT MIDWAY THROUGH. PRIOR TO THE INSTITUTION OF ANY PROCEEDING -- AND HOPEFULLY THAT ISSUE CAN BE ADDRESSED I WOULD NOTE THAT IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FIVE AND TOP OF PAGE -- SIX OUR CONCERN IS REFERENCE THEN I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS RECOMMENDED AND AN AMENDMENT. IN THAT REGARD THE OTHER ITEM -- TO MENTION IS THAT WE WOULD PREFER TO SEE THIS LANGUAGE IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE IN FEE AYE AS OPPOSED TO A NEW SECTION OF THE LABOR CODE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING -- MICROBES HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN STAFFING ASSOCIATION IN THE CALIFORNIA STAFF WITH PROFESSIONALS. I'M WORK OR NOT. PROPOSED UNLESS AMENDED WE'VE BEEN TALKING CENTER JACKSON ABOUT A SPECIFIC AMENDMENT WE'VE WE'VE SUBMITTED IT TO THE COMMITTEE. AND I'M IN AND I THINK THAT I'D BE OKAY TO SAY THAT I WE WE'VE HAD FAIRLY GOOD DIALOGUE I THINK I'M WE COULD WE COULD COME TO SOME RESOLUTION. I'M I JUST WANNA EXPLAIN THE AMENDMENT IF IT IF IT'S OKAY -- I'M JUST IT HISTORICALLY AN INDUSTRY BEEN EXCLUDED FROM REPORTING ANY DATA TO THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND THAT'S BECAUSE I'M IT'S CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. TEMPORARY STAFFING SEASONAL WORK. IN THINGS LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW THE DATA COLLECTED WOULD BE USELESS BY THE TIME IT'S ANALYZE SO SO FOR FOR FOR FOR EVER THAT SH. THAT THOSE INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM REPORTING IN AND WE'D SIMPLY JUST ASK THIS BILL. I'M MIRRORED THIS THE SAME EXCLUSION THAT EXISTED IN FEDERAL OFF YOU KNOW FOR ALL THOSE YEARS INCLUDING THROUGH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND AND YOU WOULD. ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THAT AND CONTINUE WORKING WITH CENTER JACKSON ON SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ACCOMPLISH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE APPROACH THE MICROPHONE JUST STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR ORGANIZATION. MADISON Y. ON BEHALF OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION.

KITTY HANDSOME AT THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION. ROBERT THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE THE PLUMBING HEATING HITTING A PAVING INDUSTRY UNITED CONTRACTORS TURNED OPPOSITION TODAY. SEEING NO OTHER WITNESSES ARE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. MISTER KALRA FIRST AND MISTER HOWARD THANK YOU. THAT THINK MISS CHAIR OF NEW. OF I I WANT TO ONCE AGAIN. THANK THE CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AYE AYE SOUGHT IN A PREVIOUS COMMITTEE -- AND YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT -- FIRST OF ALL HE THE PR EXEMPTION I THINK AS A CLEAR SIGN OF THE INTENTION. THAT IT'S NOT YOUR INTENTION -- THAT TO HAPPEN. SHAMING AND IN FACT -- I THINK YOU SAID IT NOW IN A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS DRIVE USING IT MORE AS PUTTING A MIRROR UP TO ONE SOUTH. AND I THINK THAT AS IT APPLIES TO GENDER INEQUITY IN PAY AYE THAT IS SO IN FACT IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR ECONOMY. THAT WE HAVE TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY INTENTIONAL IF WE REALLY WANT TO READ IT OUT AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I KNOW A NUMBER OF THE COMPANIES CERTAINLY COMING FROM SILICON VALLEY THAT ARE TAKING THE ISSUE REALLY SERIOUSLY. ARM AND AND AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERN. OF A OF HAVING PUBLIC DISCLOSURE I'M HOWEVER I WILL SAY THAT DODD LEADING. A THAT THE MARKET TO ITS OWN DEVICES HAS NOT WORKED AND IT WILL NOT WORK I I THINK THAT THE US. OF A BUT I THINK THAT BY ITSELF IS NOT GOING TO WORK I THINK THAT THAT WERE THE CASE. AYE WE WOULD HAVE WE WOULD SEE FAR GREATER STRIDES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST TWO THREE DECADES ONLY SEEN MUCH MORE ATTENTION BEING PAID. TO THE THE GENDER GAP. ABA IN TERMS OF SECTION AYE -- I'M I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OPPOSITION AND AND I AM CONFIDENT THE SENATE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK. ON THAT ISSUE AGAIN -- REMEMBER AS APPLIES TO THAT AS WELL AS THE TEMPORARY STAFFING ISSUE WHICH I THINK WE CAN COULD ALSO BE RESOLVED THE WORRY WOULD JUST BE LIKE INTENDED NOT CREATE ANOTHER LOOPHOLE AND SO I THINK IN BOTH CASES IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE FURTHER AMENDMENTS. THAT HE TO BE RELATIVELY TIGHT NARAL TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CONCERN AND I KNOW THAT -- SENATOR JACKSON HER STOP AS WAS COMMITTEE STOP HERE -- HAD THE ABILITY TO DO THAT AND I WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT AMENDMENTS THAT TIME HELP TO ALLAY SOME OF THE THE CONCERNS. I'M. ALTHOUGH I AYE AGAIN AS WAS DISCUSSED LAST WEEK I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE. I'M YOU KNOW I JOIN TO OF OUR COLLEAGUE AB SUMMER GONZALEZ FLETCHER ON A BILL THAT WAS MUCH BROADER. LAST YEAR -- THAT REALLY DID AT THE THE INTENTION OF USING HOW THE PUBLIC -- DISCLOSURE AS PART OF THE STRATEGY OF OF MOVING THE PRIVATE SECTOR A THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL DIES -- AND AYE AYE HOWEVER I THINK THIS BILL IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP -- PLAYED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT COMPANIES HAVE A BETTER SENSE AND AGAIN SOME AGREED ON THEIR OWN RIGHT NOW BUT COMPANIES HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE THEY ARE. WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE THE THE DATA TO GET THEM THERE AND SO WITH THAT IT CERTAINLY WAS? NOT YOU AS A SECONDARY MOTIONAL SUPPORT THE BILL AND CONSTRUCTED AMENDMENTS GOING FORWARD AS WELL. MORNING SENATOR JACKSON'S HYATT SOAMES TO COLOR I THINK BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT ABOUT HAVING THAT CLARITY WITH ANY AMENDMENTS CAN FORCE ON THIS ISSUE OF THAT -- STOPPING ANOTHER HIGH TURNOVER INDUSTRIES I I KNOW THAT THERE'S ALREADY I CAN EXCLUSION FROM THE DEFINITION OF EMPLOYEE OUR COMES THE EO ONE REPORTS THAT. I DOESN'T EXIST WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA YOU'RE SEEKING HERE AND MAYBE THAT WAS -- NOT INTENTIONAL BECAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT ACTUALLY EVEN CAN ASKEW THE DATA THAT YOU'RE -- TRYING TO GET FROM THE SO WOOD IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WANTED IT IS WE'VE BEEN WORKING AND I THINK WE WERE VERY CLOSE ON ON THE PASS WAS MENTIONED A NUMBER OF THE AMENDMENTS. KEEPING IN MIND THE GOAL WHICH WAS PROBABLY BETTER ARTICULATED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA THAN MYSELF -- AND AND THE THINGS I DON'T WANT TO DO -- I THINK THAT. OF WHEN WE ACHIEVED THAT AND AGAIN TAKING THE TAKING OUT THE A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IS AN EXAMPLE OF HIM. A I THINK AN ILLUSTRATION OF MY MY GOAL HERE IS TO GET COMPANIES. TO BE MORE INTROSPECTIVE AND NOT -- TO PUBLICIZE HIS TO THE WORLD I THINK WE'RE VERY CLOSE TONIGHT AND WHAT I AM. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE A OPPOSITION ON COMMITTED TO GETTING I I WOULD I LOVE TO GET THEIR OPPOSITION OFF THE BILL OF COURSE I WOULD BUT UMMM TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN COMMENDATION THAT REDUCES THEIR ANXIETY. OVER THIS I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO DO THAT WHILE KEEPING THE MAIN GOAL WHICH IS FOR COMPANIES TO SEE. AND I YOU KNOW. THE NOTION THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME FOR US TO GET TO PARITY UNLESS WE REALLY. OF A LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND REALIZED THAT THOUGH. THERE ARE NO EXCUSES THAT WE ARE NOT HAVE REACHING THAT LEVEL. OF EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY IT WHICH HAS AN ECONOMIC BENEFIT FOR TO THE STATE OF COURSE AS WELL -- THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE GOAL OF THE BILL AND I'M COMMITTED TO BOTH THE GOAL AND TO ALSO DOING EVERYTHING SO THAT WE ARE NOT SHAMING PEOPLE BUT THAT WE ARE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO COMPLY. THANK YOU THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR SAID YOU ON YOU THINK THE EXISTING EXCLUSIONS FOR TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES UNDER THE SORRY WHAT'S IT CALLED THE E. -- PROVIDE A GOOD BASIS -- FOR WHO SHOULD BE ACCEPTANCE LEGISLATION WELL THERE'RE UP I WILL TELL YOU THERE A COUPLE OF OTHER GROUPS THAT HAVE STEP FORWARD WANTING THAT SAME EXEMPTION AND I DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT MYSELF OUT OF THE BILL. SO -- WERE CAREFULLY TRYING TO CRAFT -- YOU KNOW RESOLVE THEIR CONCERTS THANKS. SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS THERE HAS BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION HOW I'M SORRY. BUT SHOWS YOUR OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE CHURCH JUST BRIEFLY -- AGAIN OF WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT LAWSUITS EVEN FRIVOLOUS ONES NOT ALL LAWSUITS A FRIVOLOUS SO EVERY TIME I HEAR THE TWO WORDS TOGETHER I HAVE TO DISCONNECT THEM. BUT THE GOAL HERE ISN'T LITIGATION THE GOAL IS COMPLIANCE AND THAT'S WHY WE GIVE THE AUTHORITY TO DIR -- TO TAKE A LOOK AND THEN TO FOLLOW UP IF THERE ARE PATTERNS AND THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY WAY TO IDENTIFY AN INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE CERTAIN CATEGORIES. SO I THINK THOSE CONCERNS ARE OR ARE NOT WELL PLACED BUT AGAIN I I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS SO THAT WE CAN MOVE THAT PAUL FORD AND AND THIS LEVEL OF DISCRIMINATION. AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. WITH THAT I'D ASTRONOMICAL. THANK YOU SENATOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL STONE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NO CHAU CHIU HOLDEN KALRA.

THAT I BELIEVE AFTER HAVING HELD TO A DIFFERENT HEARINGS ON THIS ISSUE IS WORKING. IT IS A A A STANDARD THAT IS VALUABLE -- THERE IS CASE LAW AND DIRECTION BUT THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE COURT. AND TO BE ABLE -- TO EXPLAIN AND GIVE GUIDANCE TO WHAT THIS LEGAL STANDARD IS. SO THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE HIM TO APPLY THE LAW THROUGH THE LENS OF THIS QUESTION. DID THE BEHAVIOR IN QUESTION FUNDAMENTALLY DEPRIVE SOMEONE OF AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. THAT IS THE ISSUE. NUMBER TWO SP THIRTEEN HUNDRED STRENGTHENS WEEKLY IMPLORE YOUR ACCOUNTABILITY EXISTING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO TAKE ALL REASONABLE STEPS NECESSARY TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION FROM OCCURRING. BUT ILL LOGICALLY. UNDER CURRENT LAW IN EMPLOYERS DUTY TO PREVENT THAT IT HARASSMENT ONLY KICKS IN ONCE THE HARASSING CONDUCT HAS REACHED THAT HIGH BAR OF SEVERE AND PERVASIVE OR PERVASIVE. S. B. THIRTEEN HUNDRED AFFIRMS THAT EMPLOYERS CAN'T SIT ON THEIR HANDS WHEN THEY LEARN OF UNWELCOME DISCRIMINATORY CONDUCT BUT MUST TAKE ALL REASONABLE STEPS TO RESPOND. THREE THIRTEEN HUNDRED STRENGTHENED SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING REQUIREMENTS REQUIRING TRAINING FOR ALL WORKERS NOT JUST SUPERVISORS AND FOR ALL EMPLOYERS OF FIVE OR MORE. AND INCLUDES BYSTANDER INTERVENTION TRAINING WHICH WE KNOW. IS VALUABLE BUT IT'S ONLY USED IF THE BYSTANDER WISHES TO USE IT IT'S NOT COMPELLING IT'S JUST GIVING THEM THE TOOLS. AND THE SKILLS TO INTERVENE IF THEY SO CHOOSE. AND FOR THIS CLOSEST LEGAL LOOPHOLES PROHIBITING EMPLOYERS FROM REQUIRING WORKERS TO SIGN AWAY THEIR ABILITY TO SPEAK OUT OR THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLAIM AGAINST AN EMPLOYER. AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT. OR OF CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OR FOR WAGES OR BONUS OR A BONUS WHAT IS OFTEN REFERRED TO THIS PRACTICES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS NON DISPARAGE. NON DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENT WERE SNEAKY RELEASES. I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXTRA TWENTY CENTS PER HOUR IF YOU AGREE THAT YOU WON'T. I TALKED BADLY OR DO ANYTHING TO SUE FOR THE MISBEHAVIOR THAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED OR SEEN AT THE WORKPLACE PREVIOUSLY. RESEARCH JUST. NOT ACCEPTABLE THEY ARE -- THEY'VE THEY CREATE PROBLEMS WHEN WE'RE TRYING -- TO DIG OUT AND CORRECT THE BEHAVIOR IT BASICALLY SILENCES PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO SPEAK OUT IN THE US FURTHER VICTIMIZING THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE THE SUBJECT OF THAT BEHAVIOR -- AND WITH THAT I HAVE WITH ME TODAY -- TN SORREL. SO TIGHTLY AND I'M SO SORRY TIENEN THAT WITH HER ATTORNEY LESLIE LEAVING. AS WELL AS PAMELA LOPEZ TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WITH THE BILL [inaudible] SEC. AND TO WERE ALSO TO WITNESS SUPPORT. THANK YOU ALL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS LESLIE LEVY I'M A PARTNER LEVY VINIK PARRAL HYAMS AND OAKLAND LAW FIRM THAT SPECIALIZES IN REPRESENTING EMPLOYEES AND DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT CASES. ACCORDING TO RECENT RESEARCH BETWEEN NINETY AND 95% OF WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY HARASSED EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE DEBILITATING STRESS REACTIONS. INCLUDING ANXIETY DEPRESSION SLEEP DISORDERS AND LOWERED SELF ESTEEM I'VE SEEN THESE DAMAGES AGAIN AND AGAIN IN MY DECADES OF EXPERIENCES IN LITIGATING SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES. ALTHOUGH IT'S IN THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF BUSINESSES TO TAKE ALL REASONABLE ACTIONS TO PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT GIVEN THAT A CAUSES ABSENTEEISM LOW PRODUCTIVITY AND STAFF TURNOVER. THE CHOICE TO LEAVE PROTECT PREVENTION TO THE MARKETPLACE HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. FOR THE BENEFITS OF EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OF EMPLOYEES EMPLOYERS AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE ENACT LAWS THAT REQUIRE ALL REASONABLE STEPS TO BE TAKEN TO PREVENT HARASSMENT BEFORE IT REACHES. THE LEVEL OF LITIGATION. I'M GOING TO SLEEP THE REST OF THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME TO TIE ANSWER RAIL. TO TALK ABOUT HER EXPERIENCES AS A SURVIVOR OF WORKPLACE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BUT I'LL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT HOW OUR SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWS. WORK AND OFTEN FAIL IN OUT IN PRACTICE. MISTER ROWE WAS REPRESENTED BY MY OFFICE IN A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE AGAINST A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. UNFORTUNATELY HER STORY IS ONE OF MANY THAT REFLECT THE DAMAGES CAUSED WHEN AN EMPLOYER. FAILS TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION PARTICULARLY EARLY ON DAMAGES THAT COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. IN SUPPORT OF US SENATE BILL. THIRTEEN HUNDRED I NEVER FORGET THE MORNING MY YOUNGEST CHILD AWOKE EXCITED ABOUT THE PLANS WE MADE TO CELEBRATE HIS BIRTHDAY. NEITHER HE NOR I WAS GOING TO THINK ABOUT THE RECENT AND PAINFULLY VENTS THAT OUR FAMILY WAS TRYING TO WORK THROUGH FROM WHAT IT OCCURRED ON MY PLACE OF WORK. WE'RE GONNA RIDE ROLLER COASTERS INTO OBLIVION. BUT THAT MORNING MY STORY HIT THE PRESS. I ADJUSTED MY EMPLOYER A PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY FOR FAILING TO PREVENT AND ADEQUATELY RESPOND TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY YET ANOTHER DEAN OF THE INSTITUTION. THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY WAS RIGHTFULLY ENRAGED AND MOST WERE JUST LEARNING FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS THAT CONFESSIONS. THE INVESTIGATIVE FINDINGS AND INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSES BY THE UNIVERSITY ALL OF WHICH THAT IT BEEN NEATLY TUCKED UNDER THE RUG. PEOPLE WANTED ANSWERS BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN NEARLY A YEAR. THAT ALL THE INCIDENTS THAT HAD OCCURRED. I REMEMBER LOOKING AT MY BABY SIGN. I HELD HIM CLOSE AND I SAID I'M SO SO SORRY BABY. I WILL MAKE THIS UP TO YOU BUT MOMMY NEEDS TO POSTPONE YOUR SPECIAL DAY TODAY. HE PUTS LOW HEAD DOWN. SWALLOWED MY BURDEN. CALMLY SAID THAT'S OKAY MOMMY I UNDERSTAND. AND WHILE I'LL REGRET THAT DAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE I WILL NEVER REGRET COMING FORWARD ABOUT THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT I WITH THE ONE MY JOB. BEFORE I BEGAN WORKING AT THE UNIVERSITY MY FAMILY AND I WE WERE HEALTHY WE WERE HAPPY. AND AS A BUSY MOTHER OF FIVE CHILDREN I WAS CONFIDENT COMPETENT MY WORK. AND I CONTINUE TO GROW AND THRIVE IN BOTH MY PROFESSIONAL AND MY PERSONAL LIFE. AFTER WORKING FOR PREVIOUS DEAN'S WITHOUT INCIDENT A NEW DEAN TOOK OVER HE BEGAN TOUCHING ME IN INAPPROPRIATE WAYS THAT MADE ME FEEL EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE. I DID EVERYTHING TO DENY WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME I REMEMBER MY BODY JUST FREEZING UP. I WOULD TRY TO PHYSICALLY MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY SEPARATE MYSELF FROM THE MOMENT. I SHARED SOME OF THESE EXPERIENCES WITH A COUPLE OF SUPERVISORS AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE DEANS BEHAVIOR WAS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE. BUT I WAS STILL TOO AFRAID TO TELL THEM DIRECTLY. OVER TIME I GREW ANXIOUS AND THEN DEPRESSED. MY BODY WAS EXPERIENCING SO MANY DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS I CAN'T EVEN NAME THE DEAN WAS INDEED IN A POSITION OF POWER AND I WAS HIS SUBORDINATE. SO I WAS VERY AFRAID TO TELL ON THE STOCK BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD COMPROMISE MY EMPLOYMENT. MY FAMILY WAS DEPENDING ON ME S WAS MY EMPLOYER SO I DID WHAT I COULD TO COLD. THE WHOLE ORDEAL BECAUSE MANY SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND I WAS PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED. I FOUND MYSELF CRYING ALL THE TIME EVEN THOUGH I TRIED TO BE AS STRONG AS I COULD. BUT SOMEHOW I FOUND THE COURAGE IF ONLY IN MY DESPERATION AND ANGER TO CONFRONT WHAT HE HAD BEEN PUTTING ME THROUGH. AND WHEN I TOOK THE REST TO ADDRESS THE VIOLATIONS I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE THE UNIVERSITY'S RESPONSE IS OUTRAGEOUS. I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS NOT FEELING WELL. AND THAT I SHOULD USE MY OWN HARD EARNED SICK AND VACATION TIME TO GET BETTER. EVERY ACTION OF MY EMPLOYER THAT FOLLOWED SIR TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT THE PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF MY HARASSER AS WELL AS THE REPUTATION OF THE INSTITUTION. SO THERE WAS IT WAS ON MEET TO MAKE THIS ALL WORK AND CONTINUE TO COLD. SALLY AS I WAS NOT THE FIRST KNOW WHAT I'D BE THE LAST TO GO THROUGH THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY EVENTUALLY I HAD TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION. I HAD TO FIGHT THE UNIVERSITY CULTURE THAT TOLERATE IT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ALLOWED IT TO GO UNCHECKED. MY EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN ME THAT ARE HARASSMENT LAWS HAVE FAILED TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT WOMEN LIKE ME. CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING UP OUR CURRENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAW INCLUDES THE GOAL OF PREVENTING OR AT LEAST REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. WHILE PROVIDING CLEAR STANDARDS OF RECOURSE IN Y. DISEMPOWERED VICTIMS TO HAVE THEM BE FORCED TO SILENCE. AND WHY HAVE OUR LAW ALLOW FOR GENEROUS TOLERANCE FOR SEVERE AND REPEATED OCCURRENCES OF HARASSMENT. I DON'T KNOW OF A RESULT PERSON WHO WOULD WANT TO EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND PERHAPS WITHOUT ANY ACCESSIBLE REMEDY. SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS VERY SERIOUS AND DAMAGING PROBLEM THAT LEAVES PEOPLE LIKE ME AND OUR FAMILIES TO WORK TIRELESSLY TO PIECE OUR LIVES BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. THIS IS WHY PASSING SENATE BILL THIRTEEN HUNDRED IS SO IMPORTANT. THIS WILL HELP STRENGTHEN THE LAWS SO THAT WORKERS LIKE ME ARE NOT FORCED TO TOLERATE REPEATED OCCURRENCES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT SO I URGE YOU. SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE EVERY CALIFORNIAN DESERVES TO WORK IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS FREE OF DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT Q.. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU PAMELA LOPEZ ON BEHALF OF WORK ACT. WHICH SEEKS TO EMPOWER THE VOICES OF SURVIVORS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND I WILL BE BRIEF AS I AND MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS OF WORK EQUITY HAVE TRAVELED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO MEET WITH WOMEN AND EVEN MEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THEY HAVE SHARED SOME VERY VALUABLE ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN OUR WORKPLACE TO STOP THIS BEHAVIOR BEFORE IT BEGINS. I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT BYSTANDER INTERVENTION TRAINING IS FOR SURVIVORS WE WANT TO FEEL LIKE OUR COWORKERS TO WHO WANT TO HAVE OUR BACKS. KNOW HOW THEY CAN HAVE OUR BACKS IT IS ALSO SO IMPORTANT TO PROTECT OUR ABILITY TO TALK ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCES NOT ONLY IS TALKING ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCES A PART OF THE HEALING PROCESS. BUT IT IS A WAY THAT A SURVIVOR CAN CONTRIBUTE IN VERY MEANINGFUL WAYS AS WE ARE SEEING TODAY TO THE FIGHT AGAINST AYE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND FINALLY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON PREVENTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE MOMENT THAT WE SEE SOME INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OR BEHAVIOR THAT MAKES A PERSON FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AT WORK. I BEGAN AND SO WE THANK THE SENATOR FOR INCLUDING -- INTERVENTION BEFORE -- HARASSMENT REACHES THAT LEVEL OF SEVERE OR PERVASIVE THANK YOU SENATOR I WORK EQUITY APPRECIATES YOUR WORK. OTHERS IN SUPPORT YOU CAN GIVE US YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PUT THAT ON BEHALF OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL AMERYKAH YOSHIHARA WITH CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION.

DENNIS SEATON ON BEHALF OF THE CHURCH THAT COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SAY NONE OPPOSITION. IT'S YOU EXCIMER WITH THEIR POSITION PLEASE THANK YOU. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MORE CREDIT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE OPPOSED TO S. B. THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND THIS IS A JOB KILLER FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND AND I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS I'VE. EMPLOYERS DO HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY TO PREVENT HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION AS SOON AS A COMPLAINT IS MADE AND THE AFFIRMATIVE DUTY KICKS IN FOR EMPLOYERS TO PREVENT HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE AND THEY ALSO HAVE. THAT DUTY THROUGHOUT THAT TO PROVIDE POLICIES NOTIFICATIONS TO EMPLOYEES OF THEIR RIGHTS AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER AND ISSUES ARE I MEAN ALL OTHER SORTS OF REGULATIONS. AND ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ALREADY HAS POLICE POWER OVER PREVENTING HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION THEY CAN SEEK ANY NON MONETARY REMEDY SO THEY CAN SEE CONJUNCTIONS ANYTHING AGAINST AN EMPLOYER. WHO IS NOT PROPERLY PREVENTING HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION WE FEEL THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IN ORDER TO PREVENT HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION AND UTILIZE THIS ENFORCEMENT RATHER THAN CREATING A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT ALLOWS AN EMPLOYEE TO SUE FOR HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO? I'M OUR UNDERSTANDING IS IS THAT THE APPLY TO EMPLOYEES HOWEVER CONCERN STILL IS THAT NOW THE COURTS WILL BECOME THE HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ANY SORT OF EMPLOYEE DISPUTE REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS OF SURROUNDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT CAN NOW BE BROUGHT TO COURT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THESE ARE NECESSARILY SUCCEED IN COURT DEPENDING ON ALLEGATIONS THEMSELVES. BUT THEY WILL BE OLD ENOUGH TO SAY TO ME AND PROVIDE A DEMAND LETTER TO THE EMPLOYER AND REQUIRE THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SETTLEMENT I'M VALUE IS GIVEN TO THE EMPLOYER IN ORDER. TO AS SETTLE THIS KIND OF CLAIM SO OUR BIGGEST CONCERN AGAIN IS THAT THIS IS A SKIRT AROUND THE SEVERE PERVASIVE STANDARD WHY WOULD ANYONE ACTUALLY SUPER HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION WHEN THEY NO LONGER NEED TWO ALL THEY NEED TO SUE FOR ITS FAILURE TO PREVENT HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION. AND THE COURTS A PARTY DETERMINE THE SHOULD NOT BE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THEY'VE FOUND THAT IN ORDER FOR HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND PREVENTION TO PEAK UMPS BROUGHT AS A LAWSUIT. SHOULD BE CONJUNCTION WITH HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION ITSELF THAT THERE ACTUALLY HAS TO BE HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION THAT OCCURRED PRIOR TO SUING FOR BAND FAILURE TO PREVENT WHAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION. SALAS OUR BIGGEST CONCERNS AGAIN THERE'S ALSO ISSUES WITH THE NON DISPARAGEMENT AND THE SEVERANCE CLAUSES I'M WITH THOSE ISSUES AND NON DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENTS ARE PART OF MOST SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE AUTHOR'S INTENT BUT WITH THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. THIS WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS CAN NO LONGER INCLUDE NON DISPARAGEMENT% AGREEMENT -- IN SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND ALSO FOR SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS I'M REGARDING GENERALLY SAYS OFTENTIMES THAT'S WHY INDIVIDUALS GET SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS IS THE NON DISPARAGEMENT PROVISIONS AND THE A GENERALLY CITIZENS OF THAT WILL TO BRING THOSE AT SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS AND COME AND US SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. BIGGEST A MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY JUST PAYCHECK. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US WITH A THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- IF I COULD A CHRISTMAS KAYLIE ON BEHALF OF THE AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION OF FACTORIES THREE ISSUES. OF THE FIRST IS A SECTION ONE OF THE BILL WHICH IS A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS OF INTENT I THINK IS. URINALYSIS NOTED THAT THESE ARE NON BINDING FINDINGS -- AND DECLARATIONS AND OBVIOUSLY -- WHILE THEY COULD BE CONSIDERED IT'S IT'S CHANGES IN THE LAW THAT -- YOU KNOW GIVE CLEAR DIRECTION TO THE COURTS THEMSELVES AND THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN. THE STATEMENTS THAT IS NOT LATER AFFIRMED IN ANY STATUTORY CHANGES -- THE SECOND ISSUE JUST TO EXPAND UPON THE COMMENTS THAT MISS CURTIS MADE -- CENTER JACKSON HAS INDICATED THE AUTHOR HAS INDICATED THAT SHE'S TRYING TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE COURTS AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE FIND THIS IS A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWERING. OF THE STANDARDS AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I THINK THAT THE AUTHORS AMENDMENT THAT WAS TAKEN CERTAINLY GOES A LONG WAY BUT THERE ARE OTHER AMBIGUITIES FOR EXAMPLE. IN SUBDIVISION QUE WHAT PART TO A AT WHAT POINT DOES THE EMPLOYER BEFORE AFTER THE CONDUCT A HAS OCCURRED. SO WHEN DID THEY KNOW IT WAS ON WELCOME TO THE EMPLOYEES. AND QUE TO BE. IF IT INCREASED I THINK THE CONCERN HERE IS THAT IT MAY NOT MEET THE CURRENT LEGAL STANDARD WHICH IS PERVASIVE -- OR SEVERE SEVERE OR PERVASIVE RATHER THAN AND WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN -- MENTIONED A FEW TIMES IT'S AN OR BUT WHAT WILL IN THE FUTURE MEAN IN ESSENCE FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THE ANALOGY THAT SOMEONE IS USED IN THE PAST IS. BUT AS I'M COMING UP TO A STOP SIGN OR A RED LIGHT I COULD CROSS THROUGH IN BE CITED BUT IF I STOP I HAVE NOT. SO HOW DO WE DETERMINE THIS IF IT INCREASED IN -- IN A AND B. THE STATUE OR THE BILL USES THE THE TERM OF THE CONDUCT AND THEN LATER IN SEE SAME OR SIMILAR -- HOW IS THAT HOW IS THAT TO BE DETERMINED BY THE EMPLOYER? AND THE THE LAST ITEM THAT ALL REYES IS IN SUBDIVISION WHAT WE VIEW TO BE CURRENT LAW SAYS THAT EITHER PREVAILING PARTY. IS ENTITLED TO REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. AND WE THINK THE VERY HIGH THRESHOLD THAT WOULD ONLY BE IMPOSED UPON THE DEFENDANT -- WILL SEVERELY LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO RECOVER REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLACE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AT THE WILD WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION UNFORTUNATELY ALSO OR OTHER POST. TRUE TO HIS THE CALIFORNIA THEY GET FOOD PRODUCERS ALSO POST. SEAN LOOKS NATIONAL FEDERATION OF ANY BUSINESS OR READING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO POST. NOT REMAIN COVERING TRUCKING ASSOCIATION ALSO POST. KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WERE HERE IN OPPOSITION. CAITLYN COLEMAN CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION AND OPPOSITION. DAY BUTLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED CHAMBER ADVOCACY NETWORK A COALITION OF LOCAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ORGANIZATIONS HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO MARKETPLACE. ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] WAS KILEY. AT SUCH AS THIS BILL MAY CONDUCT THAT DOES NOT MEET -- STANDARD OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ACTIONABLE NO. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS A DIFFERENT AGENDA. THE CURRENT DUTY IS THERE AND THERE'S HARDLY AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY TO PREVENT HARASSMENT. BUT IT DOESN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF SEVERE OR PERVASIVE. UNTIL A LORD DOESN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BEING ACTIONABLE UNDER LAW. UNLESS IT IS SEVERE OR PERVASIVE. AND THAT IS THE STANDARD THAT WE ARE USING SEVERE OR PERVASIVE THAT IS WHEN THE BEHAVIOR BECOMES ACTIONABLE. WHAT WE ARE SAYING ON IN OUR -- LANGUAGE HERE IS THAT AN EMPLOYER HAS A DUTY. BEFORE IT BECOMES SEVERE OR PERVASIVE. I TAKE ALL REASONABLE STEPS TRY TO PREVENT THE BEHAVIOR ONCE THE EMPLOYER KNOWS OF THE BEHAVIOR. THAT THEY KNOW IT'S ON WELCOME SO ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT -- HOW DID THEY KNOW IT'S WHEN SOMEBODY COMES TO THEM AND SAYS? SO AND SO DID SUCH AND SUCH AND IT MAKES ME FEEL BAD I'M ITS UNWELCOME AT THAT POINT IN TIME IT COULD BE ONE INCIDENT. THE EMPLOYER THEN WILL HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE DUTY WHICH THEY HAVE TO TAKE ALL REASONABLE STEPS IF THEY TAKE STEPS AND THE BEHAVIOR STOPS YOU'RE DONE. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT THE IRONY IS WE'RE TRYING TO ARE ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO TAKE STEPS AS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE STAGE SO THAT IT DOESN'T RISE TO THE SEVERE OR PERVASIVE STANDARD WHICH THEN BECOMES A LAWSUIT. I SEE SERVE THERE IS THAT A SINGLE INCIDENT AND IT'S ON WHILE TIME AND THE EMPLOYER BECOMES AWARE OF IT -- AND THEY FAILED TO TAKE -- REASONABLE STEPS DOES AT THAT POINT BECOME ACTIONABLE IT IS THERE NOW THAT NEED TO BE ANOTHER INCIDENT FOLLOWING THEIR FAILURE TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS THEY HAVE TO TAKE THEY IF IT BECOMES SEVERE OR PERVASIVE IS WHEN IT BECOMES ACTIONABLE IS WHEN THEY'RE ON THE PHONE. OKAY SO IT IS NOT ACTIONABLE IN LAST THE CONDUCT THE SEVERE PERVASIVE. IT IS IT IS ACTIONABLE IF THE BEHAVIOR IS NOT. HOME. IT IF THE BEHAVIOR CONTINUES SO THAT YOU NOW OR AT A SEVERE AND PERVASIVE LEVEL WERE A LAWSUIT CAN CAN. BUT NOT ONLY BE FILE BUT SURVIVE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION YEAH -- BUT AND THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE A SINGLE ACT COULD B. AS SEVERE ACTON AND IN PRIOR TESTIMONY WE'VE HAD TO A WOMAN WHO WAS A NINE ONE ONE DISPATCHER OPERATOR. WHO -- WAS TAKING A NINE ONE ONE CALL WHEN ONE OF HER COWORKERS STUCK HIS HAND DOWN HER BLOUSE. AND THAT -- WHILE SHE WAS TRYING TO DO OUR JOB THAT NOW DID HAPPENED A HUNDRED DIFFERENT TIMES. A THE EMPLOYER AT THAT POINT IN TIME WOULD HAVE TO TAKE ACTION -- THAT BECOMES AN EXAMPLE OF A SEVERE PERVASIVE BEHAVIOR THAT A COURT COULD THEN ACT UPON. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS IF SOMEONE SAYS SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS WE HAVE INSTANCES WHERE WE HAVE PEOPLE ON WHITE BOARDS? MAKING -- IMAGES OF GENITALIA -- IS AN EMPLOYEE AT THE AND AN EMPLOYEE WALKS IN AND HAS SPOKEN TO THE SUPERVISOR AND SAID THIS IS GOING ON THIS MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE. THE EMPLOYER'S DUTY AT THAT POINT TIME IS TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO STOP THE BEHAVIOR. I THINK THE NEXT ONE TO GIVE YOU OPPOSITION A CHANCE TO RESPOND IF THAT ACCORD THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE OF THE BILL IS WRITTEN. LOWER THE SEVERE PERVASIVE STANDARD FOR ACTUAL HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION BUT IT DOESN'T FACT CREATED NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION SO ONCE THE EMPLOYER IS AWARE THAT THE BEHAVIOR WAS AND WELCOME IF THEY DID NOT TAKE ALL REASONABLE STEPS WHICH IS UP THE EMPLOYEE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE STEPS. THAT THEY THEY TERMINATE THE EMPLOYEE BUT THEY ARE THEY RIGHT EMPLOYEE UP BUT THEY DON'T TERMINATE THE EMPLOYEE AND THE EMPLOYEE COULD POTENTIALLY BRING A CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST THE EMPLOYER NOW FOR FAILURE TO PREVENT HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION THIS IS A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. RIGHT NOW IT'S BROADENED CONJUNCTION WITH HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND NO LONGER NEEDS TO HAVE HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS TO BRING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR FAILURE TO PREVENT. TOM HOW OLD ARE. WELL IT'S KILEY HAS THE FLOOR SO IT'S UP TO HIM TO ASK QUESTIONS. MORE THAN HAPPY TO GIVE SENATOR CANCERS. I JUST A VERY QUICKLY THERE ALREADY EXISTS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION UNDER THAT. THE CURRENT STATUTES SO TO SAY THAT THIS CREATES A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT DOESN'T CURRENTLY EXIST IT'S NOT ACCURATE -- I ALSO WHICH IS LIKE IF I CAN FOR JUST ONE MOMENT POINT OUT I UNDERSTAND THEM AND THAT. THEY HAVE TO STOP YOU THERE BECAUSE THANK YOU FOR MEMBERS ASK QUESTIONS WILL ADMIT TO THAT OTHER. QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE. ALRIGHT SAID I WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND AND IN FOR CLARITY WHAT'S WHAT'S DIFFICULT ABOUT THIS I THINK IS WE KNOW WHAT THAT THE STANDARD IS THE SEVERE AND PERVASIVE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TOO MANY INSTANCES WHERE THERE IS SOME ACTIVITY BY AN EMPLOYEE. THAT THE EMPLOYER IS WARNED ABOUT AND THEN BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ACTION DOESN'T. THEY DON'T TAKE ACTION. THEN THERE MAY BE SUBSEQUENT. ACTIONS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE THAT START TO HAPPEN. AND THE NOTION WITH THIS BILL IS THOUGH SUBSEQUENT. ACTIONS WOULD BE PREVENTABLE IF THE EMPLOYER FELT OBLIGATED TO STEP IN AND A LOT OF THE EXAMPLES ARE ONCE THAT I THINK WE WOULD ALL SAY WAIT A MINUTE NOBODY TOLD THAT EMPLOYER THAT EMPLOYEE NOT TO DO THAT ANYMORE. THAT BY ITSELF IS KIND OF OUTRAGEOUS. BECAUSE I'M THE THE EXAMPLES ARE OUTRAGEOUS. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES I THINK WHERE IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE. IS. WHERE THEY'VE EMPLOYER NOW WAS ON NOTICE AND HAS BEEN INFORMED THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO STOP? FURTHER ABUSES IF THEY WOULD JUST STEP ED THEY DON'T HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO STEP IN THIS BILL GIVES MATT INCENTIVE TO STEP AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE. NO OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE HIS -- THE NOTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE THOUGH. CORD COURTHOUSE DOORS BE INUNDATED WITH PEOPLE. IS JUST NOT ACCURATE THIS IS PROBABLY THE LOOK LEAST REPORTED BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE FOR REASONS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING HERE IN OUR OWN BUILDING. VICTIMS FEEL EMBARRASSED THEY FEEL SHAME THE FEEL WITHOUT ANY -- POWER THEIR DISEMPOWERED TO RESPOND. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AGAIN BY THIS LEGISLATION AND IN SPITE OF ALL THE THE MACHINATIONS AND ALLEGATIONS OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND DOESN'T DO. WE WANT EMPLOYERS TO STEP IN AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME I DIDN'T EVEN PUT IN THERE WHEN AN EMPLOYER KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. THIS IS WHEN THE EMPLOYER KNOWS -- THEY DON'T THINK YES IT'S WHEN SOMEONE COMES THEM SAYS THIS I HI AM AM FEELING VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BY THIS BEHAVIOR. EMPLOYERS TAKING THOSE STEPS SO THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME SEVERE PERVASIVE SUBJECTING THAT EMPLOYER TO A LAWSUIT. THAT'S AGAIN THE GOAL HERE IS NOT GOTCHA THE GOAL IS TO CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR. AND TO CHANGE THE CULTURE IN THE WORKPLACE AND WITHOUT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NO CHOW. CHOW AYE CHIU [inaudible] HOLDEN.
