DOT CA DOT GOP. AND SO- AGAIN THE PURPOSE FOR THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. IS TO HAVE A DISCUSSION FOR US TO LEARN ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF LEAFY GROUP GREEN I'LL PLANT SOME DISEASES AND SAFE GUARDED AGAINST AGRICULTURAL SOME CATASTROPHE. IT'S CRITICAL IT IS CRITICAL TO OUR STATE'S ECONOMY AS WELL AS OUR OVERALL NATIONAL- SINCE OUR NATIONAL- SOME SECURITY. AS WE KNOW- HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS A STATE. WE HAVE A FIFTY FOUR BILLION AGRICULTURAL- A POWERHOUSE. AND WE CULTIVATE AS A STATE WE CULTIVATE ONE THIRD OF THE UNITED STATES OF VEGETABLES AND TWO THIRDS OF THE NATION'S FRUITS AND NUTS. HOWEVER IN RECENT YEARS WILDFIRES DROUGHT PESTS. AND OBVIOUSLY THIS GLOBAL OP PANDEMIC CAN COVER NINETEEN. THEY HAVE THREATENED OUR STATE'S AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND- AND JEOPARDIZING IN THE PROCESS OF THE ENTIRE NATION'S FOOD SUPPLY LEARNED AS I'VE TOURED AND VISITED AGRICULTURAL REGIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA EVERY REGION FACES UNIQUE CHALLENGES UNIQUE ISSUES AND IN THE CENTRAL REGION OF THE SALINAS VALLEY A REGION THAT I REPRESENT HERE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY THE HEART OF LEAFY GREEN ASSETS- SOME PRODUCTION. TO SIGNIFICANT SOME DISEASES ARE AFFECTING THAT PRODUCTION- IMPATIENS. NECROTIC SPOT VIRUS REFERRED TO AS I. N. S. B. AND PYTHIUM WILL. I IN IS V. IS CARRIED BY SOME TINY INSECTS CALLED THRIPS WHICH ARE SO SMALL THAT THEY'RE BARELY EVEN VISIBLE BUT ARE CAUSING CHAOS. IN GENERAL I AND IS TO BE- IT CAUSES YELLOWING OF OLDER LEAFS AND EXTENSIVE AND- US IN THE CROCE'S OF- ON ON JUNGLE LEAVES. BUT NO WILL TAKE. ON THE OTHER HAND THE PIT THEM WILT UNLIKE I. N. S. B. IS A DISEASE AND NOT TRANSMITTED BY INSECT. BUT RATHER IS BORN IN THE SOIL AND- PRESUMABLY LEAVING BEHIND PATHOGENS SACRAMENTO VIABLE AND SOIL FOR YEARS. AND IT'S A PITY HIM IS A BIT IT'S THIS ROOT ROT INFECTING ROOTS WITH SWIMMING SPORES MAKING AND TIRELESS FILLED WILT AND EVENTUALLY- THEY COLLAPSE. AND ALTHOUGH BOTH OF THESE DISEASES HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS LAST YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY THE RAPID ONSET OF SEVERE DAMAGE FROM BOTH AYE IN THIS B. AND PITY AND WEALTH RESULTED IN ALIGNMENT IMPACTS AND CROP LOSSES. AND WHAT'S CAUSING MAJOR- SOME CONFUSION REGARDING THE MAIN CAUSES OF- THIS CROP DAMAGE AND PLANT LOS. IS I. N. AS V. AND- THIS PITT TEAM WILL OFTEN BUT NOT IN EVERY CASE OUR CURRENT IN THE SAME FIELD. AND AS I'VE OBSERVED FIRSTHAND IN THE SALINAS VALLEY. THESE TWO- THESE DISEASES ARE CAUSING A PERFECT STORM OF DEVASTATION AND PROBLEMS. AND WELL. THESE THESE- THESE UP- THE PATHOGENS ARE ARE ARE NOT HARMFUL TO HUMANS FARMERS IN MONTEREY AND SAN BENITO COUNTY IN OUR SURROUNDING REGION. HAVE BEEN A HIT INCREDIBLY HARD AND FOR A REGION KNOWN AS A SELLABLE OF THE WORLD- THAT- PRODUCES OVER ONE BILLION AND LEAFY GREENS ANNUALLY. THESE SHOCKINGLY SUBSTANTIAL YIELD LOSSES HAVE TRANSLATED TO SOME PERSONAL ECONOMIC LOSSES JOB LOSSES AND A REDUCTION IN OUR REGIONAL AND STATE ECONOMIC OUTPUT. AND WHILE THIS HEARING WILL NOT- PROVIDE AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY IT WILL HOPEFULLY OFFER A PLATFORM FOR LEGISLATORS FOR FARMERS AND FOR SCHOLARS TO WORK TOGETHER TO HAVE A DIALOGUE IN THEIR EFFORT TO LIMIT TO PREVENT A LEAFY GREEN PLANT- SOME DISEASES SUCH AS I. N. S. B. AND US PET HIM WILT. AND HOPEFULLY- AS WE MOVE INTO THE FUTURE WE COULD FIND- THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY AND- SOME FORWARD TO THIS HEARING AND WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE RIGHT INTO THE FIRST PANEL- WHICH IS- TO HAVE A DISCUSSION REGARDING THE OVERVIEW IMPACT OF THIS ISSUE. AND THE FIRST PANELIST IS MERRY ZINC WHO IS WITH THE GROWER SHIPPER ASSOCIATION OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA MERRY ARE YOU WITH US. YEAH I'M HERE RADIOLOGY. FANTASTIC REALLY APPRECIATE YOU MAKING THE TIME FOR US AND FOR THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC AND SO IF YOU'RE READY TO GO- PLEASE FEEL FREE TO OFFER TESTIMONY. ALL. WELL I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING US THIS OPPORTUNITY TO- BRING HOME WHAT YOU TOLD ALLEN ARAMBULA CURRENTLY ALREADY DESCRIBED BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WE HAVE HERE IS LIKE NOTHING THAT ANY OF US HAVE EVER SEEN THE TOWARD AND WE- APPRECIATE ALL THE HELP THAT IS BEING OFFERED TO US REGARDING THIS PROBLEM. SO REGARDING THIS PHOTOGRAPH THAT YOU SEE ON MY OPENING WHY I THINK MOST PEOPLE EVER BEEN TO THE DISCIPLINE IS BADLY WITH THINK ABOUT PHOTO ID EITHER BEEN PHOTOSHOPPED TO MAKE US LOOK BAD OR A REALLY DREADFUL PROBLEM IN IS NAY SELF NOMINATE UNFORTUNATELY BACK IF THE LATTER WE HAD WE HAD AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER ON OUR HANDS LAST YEAR- IN. THE FILLING IS VALID. WELL MORE MARDI WHY. AT OKAY SO IN REACT TO THE FACT THAT SOME GROWERS WERE SO MANY- CHIU THAT VIRUS- A MEETING WAS HELD LAST SEPTEMBER IN SALINAS AND NEVER OVER SEVENTY ATTENDEES PRIMARILY GROWERS BUT ALSO SOME SHIPPERS AND SOME PROCESSORS TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS THERE ANY OTHER THE OF THE NEEDS ON OUR CALL LETTERS CRAP AND HE COULD YOU OF THAT MEETING WAS THAT ATTACK COURT NEED TO BE. YOU SEE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. AND THAT TIME AND HAVE OF LAST YEAR MUCH EVERY WEEK. FOR ME. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU IN OUR IN. YOU PROBABLY KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS GROW HATE MOST IS NEED. AND WEEKLY MEETING IN ORDER TO ON THE BALLOT. REALLY TO ALLOW OF THEM BUT WE GOT A CORE GROUP PEOPLE. BOTH GROWERS AND MEMBERS OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE FROM EXTENSION AND OTHER- INDUSTRY PEOPLE WHO SERVICE. OUR GROWERS- IT'S HARD TO FINANCE MINISTER BAKER HAVE ALL BEEN INVOLVED WITH THIS TASK FORCE OVER THE- BACK HERE. AND ARE FOCUS IS WE TO GO WAS TO. LOWER INCIDENCE DISEASE IN THE TRI TWENTY ONE. SO ONE OF THE FIRST ACTION THAT WE- WANTED TO GET THE OTHER STATE PLANT PATHOLOGISTS JUNE ZERO FIVE WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING. AND SO WE SPENT A DAY WHERE HEATHER SHACK FROM CDFA VISITING NINE DIFFERENT RANCHES TO LOOK AT THE DISEASE'S IMPACT AND FOR HER TO DRIVE SAMPLES. AND IT GATHERED CAMPUS NINE SAMPLES FROM NINE RANCHES THEY WERE ALL POSITIVE FOR THAT VIRUS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND IF HE SB SEVEN OF THOSE SAME SAMPLES WERE ALSO POSITIVE. FOR PYTHIUM. SO WE HAD OUR DOCTOR MAYES DOT. IN FROM STANDPOINT BUT THE THING WE WANTED TO WITH TRY AND THE LAW BECAUSE THAT WOULD REALLY BRING DID GROWER SURVEY WHICH IS THE SAME GIRL ARE TAKING MORE THAN ME. ARE YOU THAT WE GOT A PRETTY GOOD WAY. WE'VE GOTTEN DETAILS INFORMATION ON THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEALS THAT HAD NEEDED SHEET AND AMONGST THOSE FIELDS THE AVERAGE CRAP ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE PERCENT. WHICH I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW AND IT'S JUST NOT A SUSTAINABLE NUMBER GAVE. THE DEAL THAT. AND IN MOST CASES THOSE FIELD HAD BOTH IRAN AND. THE AND THE ON. SO TO BACK THAT UP EVEN MORE OR TO. OUR EVEN MORE WE CAN DO IN A- STUDY NOT A WHOLE VALLEY BUT A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE. AND A MOM WE USUALLY FORTY AND MILLION SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR. THE OTHER THING THAT WOULD BE MOST. ABOUT THAT STARTED WITH THE FACT GROW RISK A LOT MORE MONEY. CURRENTLY AND HAS MADE. TO THE THREE. AND SO WE THOUGHT INCREASE OF SIX HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS PER ACRE ON AVERAGE TO DEAL WITH HAS MANAGEMENT CAUGHT SO COMBINING ME ATACAR AND THE LOSS IN REVENUE WE BELIEVE THAT IMPACT WITH MORE IN THE TERRITORY OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND WE BELIEVE THAT COULD BE. A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE. OTHER ACTIONS THAT WE. EVERY BEGAN THE PROCESS WOULD BE TO DEVELOP THE REALLY EASY TO COMMUNICATE GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THINGS WE COULD JUST SEND OUT CONSTANTLY REMINDED PEOPLE LOVE. AS IT CAN GET TRYING TO GET AN EFFORT TO NARROW DOWN THE SOURCES OF FELONIES PROBLEM SO WE ENCOURAGE GROWERS IN DEERFIELD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE TOLD THEM IF THEY DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW THEY NEEDED TO AGGRESSIVELY MANAGE THROUGHOUT. THE NEEDED TO AGGRESSIVELY MANAGE WEEDS BECAUSE THE WEEDS CAN BE RESERVOIRS FOR THE VIRUS ONLY HOLDING TO PARTICIPATE IN REPORTING THE DISEASE SO THAT WE COULD SEE IF THERE WAS- DISEASE DROPPED ABOUT MORE UNDER MORE ABOUT HOW THE DISEASE MOVING TO THE LAST. SOME OF THE OTHER ACTION WE WERE AROUND WE HAVE BEEN NOT FEEL BUT IN OUR NATION AREAS SO WE WORK WITH THE ACT MISSIONER. WHO- ON THE RESTRICTED MATURE PERMIT THAT EVERYTHING HAS. THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON TO REMOTE THEM OF THE AND OF WE ALSO- BACK COMMISSIONER HELP WITH THE PRO WHERE WE COULD IN ANY EXACTLY WE DON'T LET. WE WERE WITH CALTRANS TOGETHER- RIGHT AWAY ON ALONG THE ONE WHO YOUR- AND HE REDUCE WE HOLD MEETINGS AND CORRIDOR. BACK I WOULD SAY WOULD PROBABLY ONLY A MODERATE SENATE AND BASS AND WE EVEN PAY HAVING SOME ONLY TIME OUR CELL IN ANY AREA WHERE WE KNEW THERE HAD BEEN A LOT. OF THE- HE ALSO WORKED WITH FIRING ARE NOT ROAD YOU CAN GET MEDIAN MODEL TO GET. WE NOT GOT AREAS SUCH AS SOLAR PANEL AND WE ALSO WERE WITH THE- YOU MAY SURE THAT WE CAN GET ACCESS TO ANY WE ISSUED. ON THEIR RIGHT OF WAY. OTHER THING EVERYDAY. YOUR WHO HAVE GROUNDING MORE THAN AREA OF THE VAN MORE VERY CLOSE SCHEDULE AROUND HERE TO RELOCATE PLANTING TO AVOID. I HAVE A THE MOST DISEASE LACK YEAR TO IT IN THE FALL WHEN- THE PROP WAS WORD. AND THEIR DEPLOYMENT AMOUNT AVAILABLE BUT THERE ARE SOME HER LEAST SOMEWHAT TALLER CAMPEON ALL THAT WAS NOT AS SOON AS IT WOULDN'T AVAIL. AT THE NOT WAY OF. BLOWING PROGRESS OF THIS DOWN- EVERYTHING YOU NEED. WE NEED TO WIN EVERY WILL REALLY ON TOP OF THE- MANAGE. WE ARE APPLIED FOR SECTION TWENTY FOUR G. OR MEDIA OR IN THE TORAK. TO GIVE US ANOTHER MADE HERE. THAT'S AFFECTED THE MR BY ON. FOR INDUSTRY WOULD GRANTED. I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT- THE CURRENT PAYMENT THE NEW SENATE AT. WE ALSO WITH IRE FOR. THE COMMUNICATION THAT WE NEW. TO CONTROL- THREAT AND MAY HAVE THAT. ON TO- REGISTER ON. WE GOTTA STAY IN OUR IN A WAY FOR MY SIDE HAD SOME ACTIVITY NOT A BUT ACT IN YES MA'AM. PROVIDERS IS LIKELY BETTER THAT WE HAD THAT. ONLY GIVE A PROBLEM STATEMENT THAT WE HANDLE MORE MEETING PRO BY INNOVATORS WHO THEY MIGHT IDEA. THAT WOULD HELP WITH THE PRICE. SO WE TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH DAVID NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT WE WERE GOING TO GET- IN RESPONSE TO. THE ACTIONS TAKEN AND- WHATEVER ELSE MOTHER NATURE MIGHT THROW AT IT THIS SEASON. EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT. IS REPAID CAN WE WERE SEEN FROM VIRUS BUT IT WAS ONLY ON THE EDGES OF THE FIELD. AND SO WE KNEW WE HAD A REPORT FROM THE GET GO THIS YEAR BUT WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT FOR THE MOST PART IT STAYED RIGHT THERE WE IN THE EARLY AND MID SEASON DEALS WE DID NOT. HE A LACK. OF THE DISEASE SPREADING. BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY DIDN'T IS THE- IN ORDER. FIELD THAT HAS. THAT WAS LOCAL NEXT. HER KERR THEY HAVE A WE REALLY. BIG GREEN. AND WE ONLY DONE THE BUYER AND THE- WERE THE- AND IN THE MOVE ENDS DOWNLANDS INTO THAT ORDER VAN FIELD AND YOUR MAIL IT. SO WE HAVE ALREADY IS NOT SAY THAT WE DID NOT THIS. PART OF WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR. WHAT IS YOUR MOM THIS NEED WE A RECORD SAM OF GROWER THROUGHOUT THE BALLOT- REPORT ON THE- AND WE- THOSE RECALL SO CAN WHERE THAT SPOT FOR DEVELOPING. SO TWENTY ONE ONE WOULD NOT THREE YEARS TWENTY TWENTY LIGHTS. BUT WE LIKE WHEN YOU BUSY WE HAD A- ONE OF ALL THAT IS TO WITH THAT WE SOME I'M AT THE- AND YOUR NUMBER- WE THINK THERE'S- INTO. SOMETHING IN THE CHURCH OF TO PER LOSS HERE. WE THAT OUR GAME- PRODUCTION WOULD IS FAR MORE IMPACT THEY- PRINTER. IN THE- WE KNOW THAT EVERYBODY HAD VERY HAD MANAGE CAUGHT. WE KNOW THAT THE DISEASE WAS MUCH WORSE IN THE FALL WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THE YEAR BEFORE AND WE KNOW FROM A SAMPLING THAT WAS DONE. DISEASED PLANTS IN MANY CASES HAVE BEEN. I WANTED TO BE PART OF THE- AHEAD REPAIRING THEM ALL THE SAME PLANS. HEY MERRY IF I COULD INTERRUPT REALLY QUICKLY- YOU MADE REFERENCE TO THE INCREASED COSTS FROM PEST MANAGEMENT HAVE. ARE YOU KNOW ARE THERE ANY OUTCOMES- FROM. YOU KNOW THE INTENSITY THAT HAS BEEN INVESTED IN THAT PASSED MANAGEMENT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE FACT THAT THAT ATTITUDE. YES HOW YES HOW YOU KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE HAVE YOU KNOW. THOSE TREATMENTS BEEN YOU KNOW WHAT SO WHAT HAS BEEN THE OUTCOME HAS IT HAS IT WORKED HAS YOU KNOW HAVE YOU HAVE AT YOUR HAS. HAS PROGRESS BEEN MADE. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME OF THAT- A LITTLE LATER WITH THE SINUSES YOU ARE. ANDREA SO. WE'RE THAN ME STORE I THINK I'M THE WAY AND HAVE THEM COME TO YOU WHAT WHAT WE SAW WITH THE DIRECTOR COPULATIONS YEAR. MAKES ITS FARM. YEAH SURE- SO WHAT CERTAINLY ONE OF HERE IT WAS A BETTER HEARING KNOW OF THE THAT MANAGE. THAT IS A WE A HUGE CENTER. ONE LANDING THE GOAL THREE IT'S HARD ON ONE INDIVIDUAL IF IT AN IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE WILL A NEW THING. BUT IF YOU THE GOAL TO BECAUSE IT DOES NOT DOWN. ONLY USUALLY WHICH IS BUT NO SEND. AND ALL OF COULD NOT CAKE WE IS ONE THE OLD THINGS AVAILABLE FOR. ORGANIC PRODUCE. AND THEY'RE BEEN YEARS RECORD. BECOMING RESISTANT TO THIS MATERIAL SO WE THINK WE'RE OUT OF OUR OWN TIME WITHOUT MATERIAL. SO I WE ALSO GET LOT OF DAMAGE THAT WE ADOPTED OUR PLAN. BUT WHAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE A- PLANTING WAS AT BUYER MOVED US. SO INSTEAD OF BEING. CONCENTRATED ON IN IN THAT LACKS YEAR THE TRYING TO ON THE FIELD WERE LOT OF LETTER WITH NEW SHIELD. YES THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT. FROM BASICALLY THE- C. WE A LONG OR TEMP. WHICH WE DON'T KNOW THAT EVERY YEAR WE THINK THAT. THE FULLER NORMAL. HAVE ALSO ADDED IMPACT ON YOUR HOSPITAL. WE ALSO KNOW THE MOM POINT TO THE FACT THAT WE A WARM FOR. AND NOW WOULD. THAT WE HAD WE GOT LUCKY THIS YEAR THE STAR OF THE WEATHER WE VERY BUT WE- EXPECT THAT TO BE IN. TO THIS. SO I. WRAP UP BY THE NAME THAT WE ALL I THINK AGREE THAT WE NEED DIRE BASEBALL TERM- AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE DON'T UNDER. A THING THE DESIGN HIS WE'RE GOING TO. SPEAKING WITH YOU TODAY ARE GOING TO BE BETTER THAN ME. AT THE FINAL WHISTLE OF THOSE. BUT WE NEED TO SUPPORT AND THEN. NEW ALWAYS LINE SOLUTIONS AND WE'RE THE FAR THAT. THAT YOU WERE TO BE AND- HAPPY WITH IF TO BE. TO THE- OUR TRYING- IN NOT IF. SO ONE AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT WE GOING TO TAKE OFF OF THEIR INTENSE AFTER NINE TO THE BY OF THE AND- SOLUTIONS SURE HELLO I AM. SURE AND- I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING US OF A PLEASE HOLD ON THE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOOK. BY REALLY PER. YOU I JUST WILL YOU KNOW. WHICH ONE IS A THING YOU FOR. REALLY HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPACTS- I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT IS CONCERNING ESPECIALLY WITH THE PYTHIUM WILT AS I MENTIONED IN. HIS OPENING REMARKS THAT I MADE IS THAT IT LEAVES BEHIND THESE PATHOGENS THAT COULD REMAIN IN THE SOIL A FOR YEARS. AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THE MITIGATION MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN ESPECIALLY DISKIN AND I'M NOT SURE IF I MISTER NOT BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. THE YOU KNOW THE CURRENT IMPACTS- GROWERS AND FARMS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. DO YOU HAVE IN IN YOU KNOW AN IDEA AN ESTIMATE AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF ACRES. THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE PYTHIUM WELL. I DON'T HAVE THE DATA AND OPINION WORLD. MORE THE DATE IS ON I. N. BI YOU CAN GET THE ENERGY. MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY. WE FOUND THAT A LOT OF THE PEST CONTROL ADVISORS WERE HESITANT. TO SACRAMENTO. THE- BEYOND THIS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE IF. THERE WAS FAMILY TO LAUGHTER ACCOUNT FOR BEFORE THEIR WILLING CHECK THAT. BUT WE KNOW THAT THE TO DO TOGETHER BUT WE DO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE SEEING. ONE OR THE OTHER BUT NOT FULL. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND SO PLEASE HOLD ON THE LINE AND THE NEXT- MEMBER THE PANEL IS RICHARD SMITH WHO IS A FARMER VISOR WITH YOU SEE A AND R. HANDLES VEGETABLE CROP US SOME PRODUCTION AND WE'D THE SCIENCE RICHARD ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I'M HERE OKAY. THEY ARE FANTASTIC. WELL TAKE IT AWAY RETURN IT'S ALL YOURS. I NEED TO GET HIS- WE NEED TO GET HIS WHY YEAH NO PROBLEM. FIGURE OUT HOW. TO THIS. YEAH YEAH THE. OKAY SO GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEN RIVAS AND- SO I'M GONNA JUST TRY TO GIVE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE OF THESE- TO DISEASES AND THEN- WILL BE GOING INTO MORE DETAIL- BUT OTHER PANELISTS ABOUT THE DISEASE BUT THIS- YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING WE KNOW WHEN YOU'RE% DEALING WITH THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM THEY KIND OF SURPRISE YOU- BECAUSE WE'VE HAD I IN IS TO BE IN THE LATEST VALLEY YOU KNOW THE FIRST IDENTIFIED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PICKING WILL- WITH FIRST. BASICALLY RECOGNIZED TO BE HERE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BUT- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN AROUND- IT'S NOT LIKE THEY JUST SHOWED UP LAST YEAR BUT- THEY DID EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN A IN A PARTICULARLY- YOU KNOW CATASTROPHIC FASHION LAST YEAR AND- YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS- AS MERRY SAID IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER SEEN I'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS AND- I'VE NEVER SEEN A DISEASE- ANAHIT AND CANNOT WAIT- DOWNFIELD IN THE WAY. THAT THAT IT HAD- AS AS WE MENTION YOU KNOW THIS HAVE BEEN RE. TO THE HEAT SPELL- BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD HE IN THE PAST YOU KNOW IN THAT IN THE IN TIMES IT IS THE THIS UP. BUT SO THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMEONE UNCERTAINTY AT THE WHY IT'S GOING UP AND I THINK MERRY'S POINT ABOUT RELYING ON A COOL SEASON IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF UNUSUAL THE COOL LAST YEAR AND- WHY THAT WAS- I DON'T THINK WE CAN COUNT ON IT FOR- YOU KNOW. THAT FORCIBLE FUTURE. AND- SO THIS IS JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME- CLOSE UPS OF IT- YOU KNOW YOU THE AYE AND IF HE GIVES YOU THAT- KIND OF BIRTH SITTING THE PRODUCT- TISSUE ON THE OLDER LEAD AND- BUT IT ALSO HAS A VERY AND WE SEEN WHERE SOMETIMES THE PLANTS LOOK NORMAL NINETY. INTO THEM AND THEN THE INTERNAL AREA IS- HIGHLY AFFECTED AND SO YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS IS COURSES UNMARKETABLE. AND FIFTY WILL EXPRESS ITSELF DIFFERENTLY IN THAT- IT DOES WILL DOWN THE PLAN AS AS THE NAME IMPLIES. AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'LL SHOW UP ON THE BOTTOM INTO THE FIELD FOR BUT IT CAN ALSO IN SEVERE SITUATIONS OF COURSE- TAKE- AT KEEP GOING IN AND CAN BE SEVERE IN IN ALL PARTS OF THE FIELD. YOU KNOW THE OTHER LEAVES- WILL DOWN AND THEN THE INTERLEAVED WITH HIM TO BE- GREEN. STILL UNTIL THE PLAN FINALLY DIED AND THEN. WITH YOU- WHEN YOU START DIGGING AND LOOKING AT THE- THE ROOT SYSTEM YOU SEE THE ACTUAL RIDING. IN AND PRIOR TO THIS- OUT YET IF THE- YOU KNOW THE- SURGEON OF HIM WE'VE REALLY HAD A ROOF RIDING. ORGANISM ON THE PLANET SO THIS IS THIS IS THE NEW- CHEN NOMINA THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HE HAD THINK THEY'LL ROUTE THE CROWN BUT NOT THE ROOT. AND SO YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF LIKE THE CONTROL OPTIONS AGAIN THIS OF THE- TALK ABOUT IN MORE DETAIL BUT- THE THREAT- WHICH SPREAD SIGN IN THE MIDDLE THIS ADDS A LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY. WHERE YOU'RE DEALING WITH- YOU KNOW INTO POPULATION AND THEIR RESPONSE TO WHETHER. OTHERS WANT THE TEMPERATURES. AND. AND THEN OF COURSE THE CONTROL MEASURES. AND THING IS ALSO. BY BY THEM AS YOU WELL KNOW IN THE LATEST VALLEY IN THE AFTERNOON WE HAVE- YOU KNOW NORTHERLY WINDS THAT COME DOWN THE VALLEY AND EVEN SEX ARE EASILY. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE THE MATERIALS THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING USED THEIR THEIR MORE MORE OF A CONTACT TYPE MATERIAL. RATHER THAN A SYSTEMIC MATERIAL FOR THEM. TO GET COVERAGE AND IN DEAL YOU KNOW NOT BE POPULATIONS DOWN ONCE THE POPULATION IS HIGH IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ONCE THE PLANTS GET BIGGER. AND SO EVEN IN IN CONVENTIONAL- IT IT IS- WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF THE TEAM- INSECTICIDE THE VERY WAS REFERRING TO IT IN A VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THEM. AND AS MARY MENTIONED WE WERE REALLY HELPFUL TO GET THIS- THE TWENTY FORTY FOR TORAK. BUT THAT WAS DENIED. AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE AND- THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN US ANOTHER TOOL AND THEN ALSO WITH HELP BUT IN- IN INSTANCE SAFEGUARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE TO THE EXISTING- THE INSECTICIDE THAT WE HAVE. ORGANIC PRODUCTION AND ASSEMBLY SALLY I THINK IS YOU KNOW- THE AG COMMISSIONER'S REPORT FOR MONTEREY COUNTY JUST CAME OUT ABOUT A MONTH AGO. AND IT DID IS IT REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GROWING- EE I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN CHARTING THE GROWTH OF THE ORGANIC INDUSTRY SINCE THE- THE EARLY NINETIES WHEN THEY STARTED- KEEPING TRACK OF THE- THE VALUE. AND IN THE LAST- BUT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF THE NUMBERS HAVE JUST BEEN INCREASING DRAMATICALLY. AND THERE'S A VERY VERY STRONG MARKET- FOR CANADA. AND WE'RE ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AND AFTER THE TOTAL ORGANIC- INDUSTRY AND SO IT'S A VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS HERE- THERE'S NO- YOU KNOW KIND OF- IT'S NOT LIKE LOOKED DOWN UPON IN ORGANIC IS PART OF THE BUSINESS THIS IS A GIFT IS ANNABELLE- ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE THOUGH IS SAFEGUARDING THIS INDUSTRY FROM- ISSUES LIKE THIS. WHERE THIS COMES ALONG AND THEN IT'S MERRY MENTION NOW YOU'RE DOWN TO ONE MATERIAL TO TRY AND DEAL WITH IT AND- THAT'S A VERY PRECARIOUS SITUATION- TO- IT BEYOND THAT WE HAVE VERY LIMITED. OPTIONS FOR DEALING WITH- THIS TAKE A TRIP IN- ORGANIC PRODUCTION AND THEN THE RESULTING- ISSUES WITH BINEBI THAT. COME ABOUT AS A PART OF THAT- AND THEN ONE MORE THING IS MUCH. OF WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH- WITH GROWERS IN CONTROLLING THE WEED HOSTS. AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE DURING THE WINTER WHEN THE LETTUCE IS NOT- PRESENT IN THE PRODUCTION FIELD THE VIRUSES OVERWINTERING. IN A RESIDENT PLAN AND WEEDS AND GO FOR IT AND IT'S MERRY- LAID OUT AB- BENEFIT EXCELLENT JOB OF ORGANIZING THE GROWTH OF FORMING A TASK FORCE IS WORKING WITH CALTRANS AND OTHER AGENCIES. AND DOING EDUCATION NEEDS- FOR THE GROWTH TO MAINTAIN- AT THIS IS VIDEO OF WE CONTROL IT THEY CANNOT FARMS. AND ROUNDING AREA. AND THEN- IF WILL IS TRICKY HAS AS- MENTION YOU KNOW A FULL BORDERS IN THE IS THE- OF- PLANT PATHOLOGY. THEY'RE GOAL BORDERS DEALING. WITH THE MASSIVE FOIL THAT THESE PLANTS ARE GROWING IN. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A BUNCH OF FLIGHT CONTROL- NEEDS BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THE MATERIALS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE TOP PART OF THE ROOT SYSTEM TO GET EFFECTIVE. ALL AND SO WE YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN RUSTRATED- IN IN A CAMP. AND LOOKING AT THAT PARTICULAR THAT PARTICULAR OPTION. AND SO YOU KNOW WITH THE SB ONE SEVENTEEN VERY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AT A GOOD CLIP. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE GOOD- INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING THE EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOLOGY OF THESE DISEASES. AND TO MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT. AND YOU KNOW TO FURTHER- EVALUATE- VARIOUS- PESTICIDE BUT ALSO BIOLOGICAL BECAUSE THE THERE'S A THERE'S A GOOD. A LOT OF- DEVELOPMENT IN- MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY ON BIOLOGICAL WE WANT TO DEFINITELY LOOK AT THOSE TYPE THE MATERIAL. AND THEN OF COURSE- CULTURAL PRACTICES SUCH AS THE IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT THE FOURTH AND THEN IT'S MERRY MENTIONED UP- RESISTANT IS IT SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE. EVALUATED AND THEN BETTER UNDERSTAND. I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATIVE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER EVEN. I THANK YOU RICHARD REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND- YOUR COMMENTS AND- THE PRESENTATION AND I THINK ON THIS LAST POINT RESEARCH NEEDS. YOU KNOW AS IF YOU CAN REALLY BRIEFLY SPEAK AS YOU KNOW AS TO HOW THIS CURRENT FUNDING FOR THIS- THIS PREVIOUS BUDGET YEAR. YOU KNOW HOW YOU ANTICIPATE THAT YOU KNOW. THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE USED IN AND HOW MUCH MORE FUNDING IF ANY IS GOING TO BE NEEDED DOWN THE ROAD AND WHAT MORE SHOULD OR COULD WE BE DOING AS A STATE. IN ADDITION TO JUST FUNDING. YEAH WELL I THINK- YOU KNOW CURRENTLY AS WE SPEAK THE CALL FOR PROPOSALS FOR THAT THAT FUNDING FOR FROM SB ONE SEVENTY. IS OPEN. TO FOR PEOPLE TO BE APPLYING FOR THE- THE FUN AND SO WE'RE GONNA- I THINK THERE'S A LOT O- RESEARCHERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW EXPLORE YOU KNOW PUTTING IN FOR FUNDING TO- TAKE A GOOD CAREFUL LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW LIKE THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND- BIOLOGY OF THESE OF THESE ORGANISMS. AND IN CONTROL- METHOD MEASURES. SO THOSE- THAT THAT'S ALL GOING TO GETTING FUNDED- AND IN UNDER WAY IN IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH IS VERY EXCITING. AND I THINK THE REALITY IS WITH SOME OF THE THINGS BECAUSE YOU KNOW. AS YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY REVISITS YOU'RE DEALING WITH A BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM. AND IF IT IS THE BIOLOGY IF THE WEATHER. AND ALL OF THESE OTHER COMPONENTS IN INTERACTING THAT- THAT MAKE THIS COMPLEX SO YOU KNOW CAN WE SOLVE THIS WHOLE THING. YOU KNOW WITH THIS- FIRST INFUSION OF MONEY- YOU KNOW IT'S PROBABLY OPTIMISTIC TO THINK THAT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC I GUESS I SHOULD SAY. THE BIG THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THAT THAT THAT AMOUNT OF FUNDING SO CERTAINLY FUNDING IS GOING TO BE A CONTINUED. A NECESSITY. AND THEN IN TERMS OF STATE- YOU KNOW WE- YOU KNOW WE'VE APPLIED FOR SECTION EIGHTEEN. AND TWENTY FOURTEEN AND SO FORTH AND SO- YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY- CAN YOU SEND. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET THOSE KINDS OF REQUESTS- GRANTED YOU KNOW- AS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE MY MIND. I THANK YOU RICHARD REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE RESPONSES- AND THEN THE FINAL PANELIST WHO I BELIEVE IS THERE WITH YOU GUYS AS WELL AS MARK MASON WITH NATURE'S REWARD. SO MARK- IF YOU'RE READY TO GO FEEL FREE. THANK YOU. I OKAY SO- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT- FROM THE FIELD SO- I'M A PASS CONTROLLED VISORS WELL THEY CERTIFIED CROP ADVISER I WORK FOR A LARGE CONTAINER SHIPPER HERE IN SALINAS VALLEY- SO I'M JUST GOING HAVING GIPSON POINTS THAT I FEEL. GROWERS IN GENERAL FEEL LIKE WHETHER THEIR CONVENTIONAL GROWERS FOR ORGANIC GROWERS AND- BUT- I BELIEVE IS THAT WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS A TRUE DISASTER- AND SAW THAT THE SOME OF THE REASONS HERE WHY I FEEL THAT WAY AND YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. AS GROWERS IS THAT WE ARE CHANGING WHERE WE PLANT- IT'S A HUGE GAPS IN GAME TIME WE STARTED BY. ROTATING OUR LETTUCE AROUND THE RANCH IS TRYING TO AVOID WHAT WE THOUGHT MAYBE THE PROBLEM AT THE END OR I AND S. B. AND SO WE MOVED OUR CLIENT TEAMS. IF WE COULD THROUGHOUT THE RANCH TO TRY TO AVOID THESE PROBLEMS- AND FROM THERE AS IT IS AS- AS THEY THE DISEASE GOT HIT SEVENTIES LOCATIONS. THAT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD AVOID IT WE STARTED MOVING THE OTHER COUNTIES- AND THEN FROM THERE THESE OTHER COUNTIES SO YOU'RE TALKING SAN BENITO OR SANTA CRUZ COUNTY- ALSO ARE STARTING TO GET THIS DISEASE. SO NOW THE GROWERS AND SHIPPERS ARE LOOKING TO OTHER AREAS- THAT WOULD BE EITHER OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OR EVEN OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY DOWN TO MEXICO TO TRY TO GROW LETTUCE TO AVOID THESE DISEASES. SO WHAT WHAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THAT IS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT- STAFF AND EMPLOYEES THAT WE HAVE BAD THIS IS A JOB LOSS SITUATION WE'VE GOT FOUR INDUSTRY IF WE START MOVING OUR LETTUCE PRODUCTION OUTSIDE OF THE AREA- SO I. THAT AT WE BEGIN AS THIS THING GETS MORE ITS OWN A MATTER TIME THE- ALL OF OUR RANCH BEGAN INFECTED WITH PETER PYTHIUM R. I. N. S. B. WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO CONTROL THE WEEDS. AND THE RAMPS BYE IT SEEMS LIKE WE CANNOT OUT RUN THIS THING- EVERY TIME WE TRY TO MAKE OUR BEST STAFF. TOWARDS TRYING TO AVOID IT AND- IT'S AN EXACT HONEST AND WE GET EITHER A PARTIAL WIPE OUT OF THE FIELD OR WE GET ENTIRE LIFE OUT OF THE FIELD. AND THAT'S JUST IT'S DEVASTATING FOR THE GROWER AND THE INDUSTRY AND SO IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT WERE PUT IN ON THIS SO THEN WHAT DO WE DO- YOU KNOW. I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES. THAT WORKS WORKS OF FLYING BLIND ON THIS- WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE RIGHT TERM BY. WHAT HAPPENS IS WE IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS IS THAT PAST CONTROL ADVISORS. MAIN POSSIBLY OVER REACTING AGAIN THIS WOULD BE EITHER ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL- WHEN. THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT WE DON'T KNOW REALLY HOW TO SOLVE IT- WE TEND TO. OVER OVER REACTED- GROWERS ARE SCARED THAT THERE GONNA LOSE THEIR CROPS AND SO I THINK IT'S A VERY- IMPORTANT. ISSUE THAT WE GOT TO THINK ABOUT AS FAR AS PESTICIDE USE- THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO CONTROL THIS. AND WE JUST NEED TO REALIZE YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING SO- SO ON THAT NOTE YOU KNOW WE'VE TRIED FOR SOME SECTION EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR SEIZE PERSON NEED TEN MYSTERY- BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF THIS RESISTANCE TO MAP THE MALE. OR THE SPEND NO CENTERS FOR NELSON AS MERRY TALKED ABOUT- WE NEED A ROTATION WE NEED WE NEED SOMETHING THAT. PASSED CONTROL ADVISORS CAN ROTATE- WE JUST NEED SOMETHING NEW IN THE TOOLBOX WE'VE ONLY GOT REALLY YOU KNOW A FEW FEW OPTIONS. AND YOU KNOWWE NEED TO WE NEED TO FIND MORE. MORE TOOLS THAT WE CAN. USE AS PAST CONTROL OF FIGHTERS- YOU KNOW THE END OF MY LIFE POINT IS KNOW THIS THING IS PUMP- WHEN WITH ROTATION AND WEEDS AND PERHAPS AN IRRIGATION. THE IT FEELS LIKE- YOU KNOW WE REALLY DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT TO DO NEXT SO WE NEED RESEARCH BIG TIME- I FEEL LIKE. I FEEL LIKE THAT THE THAT WE JUST WE DON'T KNOW WE'RE NOT THAT MUCH FURTHER AHEAD NOW THAN WE WERE YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS AGO I MEAN WE'VE MADE STRIDES BUT WE NEED MORE RESEARCH AND AGAIN IT'S BECAUSE IT'S VERY COMPLEX. I THINK WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THIS TASK FORCE IS THAT IT IS VERY COMPLEX AND IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS AND SO THAT'S WHY I MEAN. YOU KNOW THIS RESEARCH IS JUST GONNA BE OUT WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM SO- YOU KNOW THAT'S IT AS SHORT SLIDE BUT THAT'S- THAT'S KIND OF THE TAKE FROM THE FIELD. THANK YOU MARK I THINK YOU KNOW YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS PROBLEM. AND THERE ARE NO CLEAR CUT- SOME STRATEGIES OR SOME SOLUTIONS ON ON HOW WE MANAGE AND HOW WE. WE- ARE GONNA MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM- BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S- IT'S CONCERNING- LOOK YOU KNOW AS YOU MENTIONED- JUST LEARNING ABOUT THE GROWING FOOTPRINT. OF D. YOU KNOW THESE IMPACTED- FARMS AND- AND SITES. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA AS FAR AS- YOU KNOW THE IMPACTS OF I. N. S. B. AND IT'S A PITY IN WEALTH AND OTHER PARTS OF. OF OUR STATE YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF. THE DID THE MONTEREY AND SAN BENITO REGION. SO I YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBERS I CAN JUST TELL YOU WHAT I'VE HEARD BROUGH AND INDUSTRY IS THAT IT IS DOWN IN THE IN THE AREA- BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW BAD. IT IS- BUT THEY ARE THE FROM MY CONTACTS ARE SAYING THAT THEY DO YOU SEE THE I. N. S. B. DOWN THE YUMA ARIZONA AREA YES. I WOULD ALSO ADDED- OUR NEIGHBORS IN THE SANTA MARIA AREA ARE WATCHING THIS VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE THEIR PRODUCTION- SITUATION VERY SIMILAR TO HEAR ANY THEY HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF THE VIRUS IN PAST YEARS THEY'VE ALSO ADDED OPPOSE ANOTHER VIRUS CALLED ME WAS BAD WILL SO THEY'RE WATCHING ON IT VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE POTENTIAL IS THERE. FOR THEM TO HAVE A FURIOUS HE'S USED TO THAT AS FAR AS WE KNOW THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE SEVERITY OF DISEASE THAT WE'VE SEEN. IN THIS AREA. WHAT THE YOU FOR THAT- AND YOU ALL MAKING THE TIME- AT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL- AND I'M NOT SURE IS THE SECOND PANEL ALSO THERE IN THE ROOM. FANTASTIC AND SO THIS SECOND PANEL- THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND SOLUTIONS FUTURE RESEARCH AND FUNDING. AND SO THE THREE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL R. JENNIFER CLARKE WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAFY GREENS RESEARCH BOARD WE HAVE A DOCTOR ON. DOOR AREAS A PLANT. PATHOLOGIST AT CSU MONTEREY- AND THEN WE HAVE- MISTER DANIEL K. POSSIBLE. HASEGAWA I APOLOGIZE IF I MISSED- MISPRONOUNCED A NAME. WHO IS A PHD RESEARCH ENTOMOLOGIST- AND SO- WITH THAT WHOEVER ON THE PANEL WANTS TO GO FIRST PLEASE FEEL FREE. THANK YOU I'M JENNIFER GARNER I WILL GO FIRST AND HAS HE HAD UP AND WILL SAY THE BEST FOR LAST WITH WILL BEARD THE RESEARCHERS. TELL ME WHERE. MAKE IT. YEAH IN ORDER TO EARN. SORRY I NEED TO LEARN WORK. THE MORE. OPEN THE BOX. WE. FIGURED IT OUT OF TIME AND WE ARE CLOSED. AGAIN REQUIRED AND I WANT TO THANK YU FOR HAVING US. AND I. THINK I HAD IT OKAY WE GO. SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A QUICK HISTORY ABOUT- BELIEVING RESEARCH PROGRAM AND I'M SORRY IF YOU ALREADY ARE AWARE OF THIS IT IS A MANDATORY PROGRAM- AND WE ASK THAT HAMMERS. AND FORMER ONE DEVELOP WILL WAS- INITIATED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND FANS AND IT ISN'T FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND OVER THE COURSE OF HISTORY IT'S CHANGED ITS NAME A COUPLE OF TIMES DEFENSIVE DRIVER IN. THEN PRODUCTS THAT HAVE. COME ON BOARD ON THE MARKET- THE HAMBURGER FROM AROUND WE HAVE A AND OKAY NUMBER WOULD REPRESENT THREE GET- GOING TO WANT TO MAKE IS THERE'S FOR ALL OF- HAMBURGERS INTERNET AREA ANALYSTS SAY THE THREE AREAS. I REMEMBER TOTAL OF SIXTY. POINT WHERE AND A PROGRAM. SOME OF OUR CALENDARS WERE TALKING TODAY- FINANCING IF THE I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT OUR THAT. THE RESEARCHERS IT IS A DRAFT AND WE GET RAIN I PRODUCTION AREAS. WE HAVE THINK TO CONCERN- REGULAR OVER. AND OF THE BORDER IN THE MAN WITH THAT ORDER. IN THE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT- MORE HAVE ONLY ARE AND- MANY THIS IS. NEW INFORMATION FOR ANY IDEA BUT WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION AS THE SENATE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES ME FOR ABOUT- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY THOSE EVEN WITH ORGANIC PRODUCTION BUT WE DO HAVE OTHER PASS. IN THE AREA YOU KNOW THAT IF THAT WE DELIVER ANALYTIC PRODUCTION OTHER THAN AND THREATS- AND WE ALSO HAVE OTHER SOBERING DISEASES AND VIRUSES. THAT WE ARE TRYING TO TACKLE SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF ARE YOU SEE AN APARTMENT BUYERS ESPECIALLY WE REALLY HAVE RELIED ON IN THE PAST. AND WALDRON. NOT SAYING ABOUT HOW MUCH WE ARE TO HAVE. AN G. P. AND DANIEL HERE NOW THE NEXT TO WITHOUT THIS BACK. AND RICHARD WITH WRITTEN- I KNOW WHERE WE WOULD BE AT THE END OF. THE HIGHLIGHT WHAT EVERY FOR- IN. ON AND YOU SEE. THAT PRIMARY. ARE RESEARCH GO TO AND THAT WOULD OUR- THAT THE LONG TERM. TO HELP BUT THE- WITH IN FACT HAS- WE NEED RESIDENTS THEN DEAL WITH JUST OTHER INVITE AND HAPPINESS TALK ABOUT. OR MAKE MINOR. AND MAYBE POTENTIAL A LOT OF RAINFALL THE- WATER- YOU CAN READ HAVE ANOTHER. ANOTHER BY HERE AND FOLLOW G. IN OUR SECOND HIGH- SPENDING. WE BELIEVE SOME OF THE PRIME OF THE BOARD HAS BEEN INSTEAD. ABOUT WITH VARIETY HIT THE RESTART AND I THINK YOU NEED TO GET INTO LAW OF PEOPLE BECAUSE WE- YOU MEAN RESEARCHER CARE WITH FOOD AND. IN THOUSAND NINETEEN WILL FIND. THREE PROJECTS- ONE HUNDRED OPPOSED THERE WAS FACTS ARE BY THEIR- WITH US AND HOME IS LAST IN I BACK TO THE IS. CURRENTLY THIRTY THOUSAND AND WE HUNDRED THREE PROJECT AS WELL- AND YOU DANIEL PARKER GALA AND YOU CAN DOES NOT AREAS AND RICHARD SMITH ON ON A LOT OF THE FLAG. AND HERE'S BY. SO WE HAVE A TOTAL OF EIGHTY PROJECT ARE NEEDED TO BUY FOR THIS- AND AGAIN. HER DATE AND THEN SO LUCKY TO HAVE THAN. AND THERE'S A CONTINUING. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT TO THE OTHER. CATEGORIES SO I A PERFORMING ACTION AND BY IN. AREA HE IS MONITORING AND- I S. B. AN IMPERIAL- JERRY AT WHEN YOU SEE HERAND HE YOU KNOW WE'RE FOR TRYING TO THINGS IN HERE ARE LOOKING. ABOUT MEETING UNITY PRIME MINISTER THE LAST TIME I DID KIND OF YOU CAN BE LOOKING TO. AND RETURN FOR THE HE GAVE- I EXCITED ABOUT YOU KNOW NOT TECHNOLOGY. AND PRECISION AND THEN SEPARATE ACT WITH IT YOUR QUESTION ISSUES. I THINK THAT WAS PRETTY BAD I DO TO SAY- YOU KNOW DID QUITE. TO NEED. AND NICE TO GO. TO BY EDITOR TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR YOU KNOW OUR OUR IS PRETTY. ALL SAID AND DONE AND I COULD THEY'RE THE TYPE OF THEIR THIRTY TWO PROJECT AND IN THIS- YOUR THAT WE THAT WE'RE FINDING AND IF I FEEL OFF THOSE BREEDING AND GENETICS- THE PROJECT IN THE FUNDING DOLLARS. WE'RE LOOKING AT REALLY- AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS OR THEY GO TO OUR NEEDS AND OTHER PROJECT ONE. ON AVERAGE NUMBER TWO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU THAT FIGURE TO SHOW THAT ARE FUNDING SOURCES PRETTY MODEST- RESEARCHERS OFTEN USE OUT OF THE WAY TO GATHER PRELIMINARY DATA AND THEN PLEASE. TAKE OTHER LARGER GRANTING FORKLIFT- LARGER GRANT AND THEY OFFER YOU ACCESS. FOR MATCHING FUNDS WHICH WILL HELP THEM GET MORE. MONEY ORDER. SO- POINT BEING THAT ONE SEVENTY MONEY. REALLY PERSON. AND WILL HAVE. HOW I DON'T GET GET AGAINST ON. THE PROJECT AND HELP LINE. THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR AND YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW THIS- BUT IN TO FINDING OUT KNOW OUR STAFF DID- INITIAL SAYS AND- YOU KNOW LOOKED AT A FUNDING FOR YOU KNOW HIS- SOME FUNDING FOR- SOME PEST DISEASE AND- SOME PREVENTION AND- OBVIOUSLY IN THE PAST WITH- SOME SIMILAR ISSUES THAT. HAVE OCCURRED HERE IN OUR STATE YOU'VE YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN EFFORTS SUCH AS SELF ASSESSMENT TO INCREASE FUNDING. HAS US THE US D. D. D. A. R. HAVE THEY FIND IN ANY OF THIS LOCAL RESEARCH AT ALL. IN YOU NAY I DON'T HAVE ANY DANIEL MURPHY THERE'S SOME OF THAT I THINK WHAT I'M GOING. YEAH HEY MISTER REDUCE THIS IS DANIEL AUSTRIA AND I'M RESURGENT WITH USDA IN SALINAS BUT I WILL SAY THAT WHEN YOU. SHORTER I WON'T GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT WE RIGHT PROJECT PLANS IN TERMS OF- WORK THAT YOU KNOW WE WANT TO DO AND THAT IS NEEDED AND I'VE- CONTINUOUSLY WRITTEN IN PROJECTS THAT. ADDRESS THE I. N. S. B. INTEREST CHALLENGES SO- IN THAT SENSE WE ARE RECEIVING SOME FUNDING- FROM U. S. SKATER SUPPORT THIS RESEARCH AS WELL. THAT'S GREAT THANKS DAN. THANK YOU. YOU AND I WOULD MENTION AGAIN WE DID SEND OUT THE CALL FOR PROPOSALS THE BIGGEST REASON FOR- THE DOLLARS WE WERE DETERMINED SB WON SEVENTY ALLOCATION AND PHOTOS- PROPOSAL ARE DUE DECEMBER FIFTEENTH SO MANY PROBABLY. I'LL BE RECEIVING FIGHT ON. SO REALLY FOR TO. BEING BACK. BUT WE WERE. THAT'S GREAT AND JANET- WILL REALLY BE YOU MAKING TIME FOR US. I CAN THAT OUT. OKAY AND I. ALL WITHIN A FULL. COOL. ALL. THANK YOU. YEAH. OKAY YOU CANNOT APPLY. TO I THINK. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN AREA- GOOD AFTERNOON- HOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO- SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE- THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING ANA IF IT AVAILABLE UP LETTERS- BUT YOU WOULD SEE IN THE ON THE SCREEN MY NAME IS A BIG PIECE ON THERE ARE COMING UP WITH THE PROFESSOR OF PLANT PATHOLOGY- CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY MONTEREY BAY. AND EVEN THOUGH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS WORKERS- BLAME THE FOUNDATION FOR THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE FACING HERE- I DO WANT TO SHOW THIS PICTURE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO TAKE THEM THE IDEA THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE THINGS WENT BACK TO NORMAL TWENTY TWENTY WAS DEVASTATED BUT AS YOU CAN SEE IF YOU WERE BORN OR PLEASE FEEL THESE GROWER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS AS BAD AS SOARED TWENTY- YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS. ACT OVER LIKE OUT OF A GENERAL AND WIDESPREAD DEVASTATION CAUSED BY THIS WOULD BE FIFTEEN WILL BE SEEN- AND EVEN THOUGH YOU WE SAW ADDRESS DURING PART OF THE YEAR LET ME SEE SHOWING UP WHEN THEY SEE IT SHOWED UP IN A WAR BECAUSE OF A MAJOR DAMAGE IN MAJOR OFFICER INDUSTRY SO I WANTED JUST TO HIGHLIGHTED THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING- KEEPING THAT IN MIND THIS FIFTY YEARS BACK IN IN IN THE- AT THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD BE UNFORTUNATELY DILLON WHERE FOR THE NEXT- HE YEARS. BUT AND WE HAVEN'T- IF YOU COULD BRING THAT PHONE THAT BIGGER BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE TALKING I'VE IT I'VE SEEN A DEVASTATE BUT SOME MY CALL HERE. HAVE NO I WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT SO WE GET WE GET THAT ACTION WOULD BE- I. HAVEN'T HEARD OF I THOUGHT THAT I HAD. UP LET TRY. TO YEAH. NO IT'S NOT POPPING UP YET. HOLD. HELLO SORRY THAT I'M HAVING A TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. YEAH WHAT NOW HOWEVER THERE YEAH YEAH THE OKAY. MAYBE IT ISN'T THE SUBWAY. OKAY LIKE. YOU SEE IT NOW THANK YOU. SORRY ABOUT THAT ARTICLE THAT FOR THAT THANKS FOR LETTING KNOW. YOU CAN SEE HERE DEVELOPING ACTUALLY IN THE- AREA COULD SEE THAT. THIS IS A FIELD THAT WAS PLANTED NORMALLY IN WHAT TO BE THE OUT OF THE BETTER WILL HARPER DID OF ACCESS COULD NOT BE HARPER BECAUSE ALL THE- THAT YOU SEE THAT ARE MADE THEIR YOU'RE WELCOME ALL EVERY SINGLE AND- IS OF IF IT WILL INFECTION THE BILL HAS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE. RIVAS MENTION HINDI ARE THE THINGS IS- ACTUALLY WE YOUR- FOR BORN SO THIS IS A- A PASS AGAIN CAN SURVIVE IN SOIL FOR LONG OF TO IN FACT THE PLAN. AND COVERED A BAY. CHARACTERISTIC DAMAGE TO THEIR- YOU KNOW THAT LIKE- MY CALL RICHARD SMITH MANY BEFORE WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT BEFORE BECAUSE IT IS VERY UNIQUE OF- IF. YOU GET IT- EVEN THOUGH THAT FEARS IF NOW. A MAJOR PROBLEM IT'S GOING AN EMERGENCY IF THAT IF COULD NOT I NEED TO THE STATE OF. BEEN DECEIVED WORLDWIDE ONCE ABOUT THE- IN NINETY NINE FIVE. AND THEN WAS- DISCOVER IN MONTEREY COUNTY YEARS LATER IN ELEVEN- BUT UP UNTIL NOW FROM TWO ELEVEN UP UNTIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THAT IS THERE'S MORE PRESIDENT INNOVATIVE ALL CONSIDER A SECONDARY FIFTEEN. YOU IT WOULD BE ALL OTHER PATENT INFECTING PLAN THERE WERE OTHER PATH CAL YIELD. IN HE WOULD PAID HIM THERE KIND OF LIKE AT THE TOP OF OR- HAS BEEN. THEIR ROOTS NOT BEING THE MAIN HI OF THAT OUT THERE PLAN ANYTHING YOUR LIFE WITH- IN THE IS A PICTURE GET SEEN. HOW EFFECT BE ON THE LINE. A ROTTED PLAN ALL THAT BROCK BLACK COLOR. THAT IS NOT. WHAT BLADDER. SHOULD LOOKING THEY SHOULD WHY AND A LOCAL NEXT RIGHT- BUT SO DO BAR DID THAT. WITH IS BECAUSE THE PIECE OF ACT DE SO PLAN DOES. NOT LONG ROOTS BACK. OFTEN TO EIGHT. IT'S MORE RIGHT. THAT YOU WOULD ON. PARTICULARS END OF THE AT THE OF THE PEEL WHERE WERE WHETHER. MORE ANY SOME FEEL BETTER AFTER IN FUTURE THOUSAND TO START INTO THE ELEVEN. EIGHTEEN THEN AGAIN IN TWO NINETY DOT AT THE TIME WHEN I AM. IN COUNTY IN IOWA PRESENTED THE ISSUE A WOODEN WE KNEW. YOU CAN. RIGHT BACK. GOT IS WHAT WATER THE FROM ABOUT TWENTY- BUT WHAT WE STARTED TWENTY. AT EPIDEMIC THE WHAT THE AND OUR- ANY FAVORITE IN FROM OF THOSE EXAMPLE. TEXTBOOK FOLLOW X. COMPANY OUTBREAK OF THE DISEASE- CONCENTRATING A PARTY AREA ACTUALLY- FROM THE ORIGINAL SOARED OF WHERE THAT IS USED. FOR POWER IT IS. THROUGHOUT THE COGNITIVE LOSS OF THAT IN SOME. OF A BIRD COULD NOT HARVEST AND COULD SEE THIS- DO THAT AGAIN OUR- OUR FEELS THAT WAY AND HARD BECAUSE PLANS FOR THAT NOW. EVEN NOT THEIR REMAINING- OF THE OPERA HARBOR- TAKEN CARE HAPPEN HAPPENING. TO HELP YOU THEY HAD A ECONOMIC AND- WITH MEN OF IN LOSSES- PENNIES NOW CONSIDER IN DEAL. IF NOW CONSIDER THE MAIN ROAD BROADER PROBLEM- UP LETTERS GOING TO A BLUE. OF COURSE THAT GOOD TO ME. AND I ONE OF MY MICHAEL THAT- THESE YOU HAVE ACTUALLY A FIVE. IN. A PATH IN IN AS IT WAS POINTED OUT IN FACTORED INTO THE SESSION IT HAPPENED IN HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SURVIVE IN THEIR SOULS FOR VERY LONG TIME SO KNOWING THAT THE PATH OF THE EITHER READY PRESS WOULD HAVE MADE IT TO THE BOULDER LOCATION THERE IS PRESENT IN THE COMING LOCATION. EVEN THAT IDEA THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE PRESIDENT IT MIGHT NOT BE SHOWING UP VERY DRAMATICALLY- NOW BETTER WE COULD BE. THANK SOME SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ARE SERVICE. IMARI COUNTY AREA- INDUCE OTHER REGIONS IN THE FUTURE. HI SO DR. SO BECAUSE THESE PATHOGENS REMAIN IN THE SOIL- FOR YEARS AS IT'S BEEN STATED- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT PLOT OF LAND THAT YOU KNOW ONCE VERY- HIGHLY- A PRODUCTIVE. PLOT OF LAND WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT NEXT YEAR AND BEYOND. IS IT JUST STAY IDLE. THAT THAT IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND WE ARE TRYING TO WORK ON. APART UNDERSTANDING MORE THOSE PATTERNS SO ONE OF THE WHAT DID HAPPEN IS OPPORTUNITIES MICROBES PRODUCE THESE ARE- IT'S AN ALMIGHTY PATHOGEN IT'S NOT A WHOLE LOT HAPPENED IN IN THAT IS NOT A TRIVIAL AMOUNT OF BERMAN OUR THE TRIVIAL DATA. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO THINK IN MIND THAT NOT ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THEIR LABEL HAS HARMED EFFECTIVE WOULD BE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE AGAINST THIS PARTICULAR PATENT THE DEFLECTOR OF ME STRUCTURES CALLED THE SPORES THAT ARE LONG TERM FIX FOR THE SURVIVAL OF STRUCTURES THAT CAN SURVIVE DESICCATION CAN SURVIVE WINTER CONDITIONS AND CANCER BY THE LACK. OF DEPTH CLOSE TO BEING IN THE SOIL SO YOU COULD EASILY HAVE TWO YEARS OF NOT HAVING ANY LETTER IN THE VIDEO AND THEN YOU PLANT AGAIN AND IT HAPPENED IN THE BOARD JUST SHOW UP AT THE CABIN WOULD BE TRIGGER AND THAT WOULD GIVE. SIGNAL THAT THE TECHNICAL IS BACK IN THE FIELD BUT THAT IS WHY WE CANNOT SIMPLY RELY ON- ASSUMING THAT BY NOT A PLANT IN LETTERS WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING CARE OF THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE PATH AGAIN WOULD EVENTUALLY SHOW UP. WHENEVER THEN- THE CROP BACK IF SAME WAY. WE HAVE TO BE VERY STRATEGIC IN A WAY THAT WE CONTROL THAT HAPPENED IN TWO STRIDES REDUCE THAT INOCULUM BUILD UP BECAUSE AS YOU SAW IN THAT. PREVIOUS SLIDE INTO CAN- FAILED THAT. ARE HAVING. LIKE THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE. FOR OFTEN HAPPENED IN THIS. SO THIS WOULD BE SO FEEL THAT POTENTIAL. EVEN MEDICAL OF ARE RIGHT NOW YEAR WHAT MORE BE A GREATER RATE. OF THE DISEASE IN- AND NEXT YEAR BUT MAYBE MIGHT NOT BE NEXT BECAUSE WHETHER. ARE NOT CONDUCIVE TWENTY COULD BE THE FOLLOWING SO WE CANNOT JUST SIMPLY RELIED ON THE FACT THAT WE ONE YEAR WITH THE DISEASE AND THE OTHER NOT. WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE IN WAYS TO REDUCE THAT INOCULUM BUILD UP BECAUSE THAT IS ULTIMATELY. THAT BUT THE WAY THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MITIGATE ANY THINGS WHEN THEY'RE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE AFFECT THAT EFFECTIVE YOU CAN EXPECT. IS SET ASIDE THE TIME THAT YOU SEE THAT SYMPTOMS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE LEFT. IT'S HARD TO BELOW GROUND SYMPTOMS- YOU CAN SEE THE ROOTS. ARE COMPLETELY- THE PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD WITH THAT OUR DATA AND AS YOU MIGHT YOU WOULD SEE ON THE PICTURE ON THE VERY LEFT- CORNER AT THE BOTTOM- THAT RODDY IS CONCENTRATED OUTSIDE. OF THEIR ROUTE AND THAT IS- WATER BODIES VERY PARTICULAR UP THESE- YOU SEE THE DOG NOT INFECTED THE CROWN FOR THE INTERNAL. ISSUES OF THE ROUTE AND THAT'S WHY THE PLANTS DON'T DIE IMMEDIATELY SO YOU WOULD SEE ON THE PICTURE OUR WEATHER WITHIN THE BELOW GROUND SECTION- THE PLAN FOR THE ROOTS ARE COMPLETELY NEW PRODUCT IN IN MEANS TO MANY OTHER THE ROUTE. BUT THE PASS SOME OF THE LEAST REMAIN VERY GREEN AND ACTUALLY LOOKS JUST FINE SMALLER BETTER FIND IN THAT IS ONE ACTUALLY ONE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WOULD BE IF THAT BY THE TIME THAT. THEY THINK THAT ARE SHOWING UP IT'S ALREADY TOO LATE AND THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO REVERSE. THE EFFECTS OF THE DISEASE SO WE HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE IN MAKING ME- PREVENTING THAT THIS IS TO OCCUR BY BY THE TIME THAT IT. SHOW UP IT'S A FAMILIAR AT THE CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF IMAGE. THE RIGHT- THE IMAGE THE RIGHT. OF YOUR SCREEN- YEAH THE PRESIDENT THERE IS A BIT A LARGE PLAN BASICALLY HELLO PLAN THE DISEASE AFFECTED. TOWARDS LEFT IN WE DO THE SIZE OF THE- THAT THE- IN DOT IF THE PROBE. OF PROBABILITY IN HOW- THAT SEEMS TO OF THE ROUTE HOW OCCURRED. ALL THEY MORE THE PLAN IS DEFEAT. THE LONGER KIND OF THING FIELD WITH DOES NOT FUNCTION ROUTE. THEY MORE THE PLAN WOULD START SPRING CAMP. IN THE WAY THAT THE KIND WOULD TRY TO GET. SOME OF THE LEAST WHAT IF THERE WORLD IN OUT. THERE ONE OF THE MAIN TELLING GIVE UP YOU WOULD SEE. IN THE- THE FLAG EFFECTIVE SYMPTOMS. REMAINED RESEMBLE WATER STRESS PLAN. FOR YOUR RECORDS WOULD OFTEN MISTAKEN. THEY SENTENCED BY THE PLANTS NEED MORE WATER AND HOW DID WAS VERY ACCURATELY- MENTIONED. BY YOU IN IN YOUR INTRODUCTION COMMENT THESE ARE THE HAPPENED IN PRETTY TO. THE SPORTS SWIMMING AND SPORTS. THIS IS KIND OF LIKE A PERFECT STORM SITUATION BECAUSE THE PLANTS LOOK LIKE NEED WATER. GROWERS PUT MORE WATER IN THEM DAYS SPREAD THEIR SPORES. DESERVE SWIMMING SPORT ARE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE FEEL IN BATH WHEN YOU SEE AN OVERALL COVERAGE OF THE FIELD LIKE YOU SAW IN THE PREVIOUS LIFE. EXACTLY HERE YEAH- ONE. OF WHAT YOU WERE LIKE TO WOULD IN THE- ON THE LEFT YOU SEE IF THERE ARE. SOME HEALTHY FOR SOME DRAMATIC. THAT DOT AND WE LOOK MORE CLOSELY. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT OF THE- THERE WITH FROM. RE AND IN THERE ARE NO. LONGER ROUTES WERE. WHAT THE USES TO UP SO WATER NORTH THAT THE IS WHY. THE PLAN FOR- YOU CAN CLICK. AND OF THE OF YOUR SEE AT HAD FIFTY FOUR AND WITHIN COURTS. I'LL BE WORK IMAGES THERE WERE TAKEN UNDER SAME SPOT EVERY THREE WEEK SO YOU GET THE LEFT. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY NOW- FIVE WEEKS AFTER. WE ARE THEIR- PLAN THAT LOOKS HERE. THANK WATER. IT DOES LOOK LIKE THE PLANET WHY MAYBE. THE ONE TO GET IN WATER OUT WE PRO. THREE WEEKS LATER. MMHM ARE THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE SIR. DAN THREE WERE LATER SAW THE- IN WITH MORE. IN THE AREA NOW IT'S SHOWING THE SAME TO. AND THEN THREE WEEKS BY ELEVEN WEEKS AFTER PUBLIC CAMPAIGN YOU SEE THAT THERE MORTARBOARD THERE WERE MANY MORE PLANTS ALREADY SHOWING THE SYMPTOMS. ONE MORE AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY SOME PLANS THAT WERE ALREADY COMPLETELY GONE- PRESUMABLY. THE PLANS THAT WERE INFECTED FIRST BECAUSE THE SECOND I'VE I'VE HAD SITUATION WHEN PLAN THAT. EFFECTIVE PLANT. THE FULL CLOSER TO BE NOTHING IMPORTANT- NEWER PLANTS SO IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT THROUGHOUT THE SEASON WE COULD SEE CONTINUE ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE RIGHT. ENVIRONMENTAL. CONDITIONS ARE PRESENT. SO NEXT. TO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO- COMPANIES IN WE'VE BEEN. ON THE- MARKKANEN'S VERY ACCURATE. WITH COMING UP WITH PRIOR OF- FOR MANAGING DISEASE BUT IT HAS BEEN BASED ON THE LIMITATIONS OF THE FUNDING CAPACITY IN THE FUNDING RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN UP UNTIL NOW. WE HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM I'M VERY- SHORT TERM- WAY IF WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EVERY YEAR TRY DIFFERENT NEW THINK BASED ON THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE SHOWING. YEAH EVERY YEAR STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY WE WERE OBSOLETE VISIONARY AND I WE WERE AHEAD OF THE ISSUE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ALWAYS. BE APPRECIATIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH- LET CALIFORNIA LEAFY GREENS RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT STATE FUNDED THAT RESEARCH COMPETITION WILL BE FOR THE OUTBREAK HAPPENED SO IT ALLOWED US TO ACTUALLY HAVE A PROJECT ON. ONGOING PROJECTS BEFORE THEY AND THEIR THEIR WARDS PART OF THE OUTBREAK I HAPPEN TO EITHER THEY EACH OF THE INTAKE. OF COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE. EVEN THOUGH IT TOOK WITH OUR HANDS AND FEET HI GOOD YOU KNOW HOW TO MANAGE IT- BUT LAST YEAR WITH OTHER EASTERN A WEEK. WAS THE LACK. OF THE TV SHOW UP MORTON- LATE IN THE BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES IN THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WE WERE LIMITED IN A WAY THAT HOW HOW TO PROVIDE- MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVE TO COURTS TO WIN THIS NEW SOURCE OF FUNDING. WHAT WE ARE- ARE HOPING TO ADDRESS THESE COMPLEMENT SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THE FROM THE STANDPOINT. OF NOT JUST PROMOTING THE USE FOR MORE CHEMICAL APPLICATIONS WE ARE NOT PROMOTING OR ADVERTISING THE USE OF SOLAR FUMIGANTS BUT INSTEAD WE ARE TRYING TO COME UP. WITH AN INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT APPROACH. OR WE COULD HAVE ARE TO A- OUR INTER INTO THE EVENING STRATEGIES. INCLUDING CLICK- YEAH LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF IRRIGATION LIKE I MENTIONED THE WATER PLAYS A ROLE IN THE DISTRIBUTION ND ALSO THE BIOLOGY OF THIS FACTORED INTO HOW WE CAN MANAGE THE WATER MORE- IT'S RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW WITH THAT WE ARE GIVEN DIFFERENT ACROSS THE WATER THAT THEY NEED TO BUT WE'RE NOT GIVEN EXTRA WATER. THAT MAKES IT EASY EVEN AWARD- PROPER PATIENT IN A WAY THAT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE TAKE THE LEAD TO WAY FOR S. SEASON FOUR TO SEASON AND THEN WE PUT IT BACK AGAIN WHAT COULD BE HOW CAN WE FIND THIS PROBLEM WITH PATIENT THAT WOULD REDUCE THAT HAPPENED IN. INOCULUM BUILD UP IN THE STORE OR PROVIDED TIME THAT WE PUT THAT UP AGAIN WE ARE NOT A PLAN GENE THE LETTER IN A FIELD COMPLETELY INFECTED WITH THE PATHOGEN. AND WE'RE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WE KNOW THAT THIS HAPPENED IN BENEFITS FRAUD WARMER SOILS ANYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT- IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ANY EXCLUSIVELY LAST YEAR WE OBSERVE WITH THE YEARS. OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE- WARMER IF SOLD WORK ALSO ARMENIAN DOT L. TO ACCELERATE THEIR BIOLOGICAL CYCLE UP TO PASS AGAINST- IN THIS SORT OF THE WE'RE LOOKING CLOSELY AT THAT BUT ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT IT MIGHT BE SOME HOPE OF A RECEIPT SENT. OUT SIGNATURE THAT WE MIGHT BE AND WHETHER WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE COST PLANTS ARE CULTIVATED THAT ARE NOT. AFFECTED AT ALL OF THE INDUCTEES BACK CIRCLE ON THE TOP RIGHT CORNER DID YOU WOULD BE YOU HAVE TO IN THE SAME FIELD TO VARIETY IS ON THE LEFT ONE THAT SEEMS TO BE NOT AFFECTED IN ONE ON THE RIGHT ONE THAT I. WHAT COMPLETELY DEVASTATED- AND TAKEN DOWN BY THE DEFEATS ABOUT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING WATER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD BE USING NOT ONLY COMMERCIALLY BUT ALSO BE USING. FOR BREEDING BOB PROGRAM. NEXT BETTER AFTER SAME TIME. THE OLD. WAY TO- TESTING MORE EFFECTIVE AND- WAYS ABUSE IN. AND WE ARE NOT. TELLING THE INDUSTRY THAT THE SHOULD. USE PETRIFIED BECAUSE THE SAID WE- ON PORTER- IN LAW. WE STILL HAVE SOME CAMERA. THAT ARE DEFECT I CAN THIS- THIS. IN A WHAT WE TO MAKE IF WE ARE USING. THEIR CHEMISTRY OUT THERE RIGHT. IN WITH THEIR- PUBLICATION CAN. OBTAINED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE ARE PUTTING EFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING THE DISEASE AND NOT JUST. WASTING NOT ONLY MONEY BUT ALSO CONTAMINATING DISORDER WITH WITH THE CHEMISTRY. AND ALSO COMPLEMENT THEM ALL THESE TECHNIQUES TO AVOID. BIOLOGICAL CONTROL IN A WAY THAT HOW WE CAN MAXIMIZE THEIR TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THE BENEFITS OF THAT MICROBES EVA. MIKE GOOD MICROBES IN THE SOIL CAN GIVE US TO OFFSET. THE EFFECT OF THE NEGATIVE PATHOGENS IN THE SOIL. THE WE'RE ALL COMMENDED FROM ODEON. PLAN HELPED TRYING TO KEEP THE PLANTS MORE HEALTHY BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO KEEP THE SOIL HEALTHY WOULD LET. LET APPLICANT BUT ALSO WITH MORE- HEALTHY CONDITIONS THAT CAN SUPPORT. ACTED CONTINUOUSLY TOOK ABOUT PLANTS THAT ARE ALSO PERFORMING BETTER INSULTING MEDLEY DOT COMBINATIONS PROMOTING MORE SUSTAINABLE CROP PRODUCTION. NEXT WE ARE THEY WHAT IS THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING ALL OUR- RESURGENCE RODRIGUEZ IS BY MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE DISCOVERED ALL THE FINDINGS THAT WE HAVE. WE ARE HELPING THEM IN COLLABORATION WITH THE INDUSTRY WE ARE CUTTING OUT. ALL ALONG TRIAL- SET THE TRIAL WAITED GROWERS IN COMMERCIAL FIELD BUT ALSO IN RESEARCH- IF THEY HAVE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT A- CHEAP ALL WHOLEHEARTEDLY PARTICIPATE YOU FORMATION THE NOTED. THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY BY I KNOW BUT WE ARE IN. DELIVER THAT IN. TO IN THE- THROUGH THE FOUR EVERY WEEK WE GIVE OUR- TO THE- OR WHAT WE BEEN TED WATER ARE. IN WHAT IS WORK AND WHAT IS THE STOCK AND WITH THAT- I WOULDN'T LET. BE I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE IN IN IN IN. MENTION MAYBE PERHAPS AND ECONOMY POSITIVE NOTE EVEN THOUGH BY THE DEVIL. AND HAPPIEST EFFECT OF THE- DISEASE HAVE HAD A IN THE- I ALSO TO MENTION THAT PUBLIC. THAT HAVE TO BE. THROUGH THE RECENT WE DO. ANY IS THERE COULD OF WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT IN. VALLEY WE HAVE- I MIGHT AT B. I. LI AYE PART I RECALLED FROM OF MAKE. AND WE BEEN WORK UNTIL VERY ACTIVELY WITH US FROM THE COMMUNITIES. FOR MY ARM SUFFICIENT BUT ALSO FRONT- HOLDER EVEN UNIVERSE. ENGAGE THEM INTO TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION GETTING THEM INFORMED ABOUT A WATER IN CHALLENGES IN NEED- DIFFERENT DISEASES HAVE BECOME OR CONTENT OF OUR FORTY FIFTH IN A WAY THAT IS STUDENTS ARE TRYING. TO COME UP WINNERS OF PROBLEM SOLVING SOLUTIONS FOUR DAYS- FORTY FIFTY FIFTY- WE CAN GET THERE DEFINITELY THE FUNDING FROM THE S. B. ONE SEVEN IT WHAT ALLOW TO KEEP SUPPORTING LOCAL STUDENTS TO ENGAGE IN THESE. RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES AND ALSO GAIN KEEPING. IF THE BALLOT BEING THAT COMMITMENT IN THAT ENGAGEMENT WITH THEIR INDUSTRY TO TRY TO SOLVE. THEIR CHALLENGES AND NEEDS THAT BETWEEN THE THREE HAVE- IN ADDITION. WE SEE THIS ARE THE TWO WAYS- APPROACH IN A SENSE THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY TRAINING HARD IN THIS REGARD FOR OUR WORKFORCE WE'RE ALSO. AND IN A WAY TO ADDRESSING SOME OF THE LABOR SHORTAGES THAT WE HAVE IN THE NEEDS THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS FOR MORE TECHNICALLY TRAINED- I WORK FOR IS THAT CURRENTLY IS NEEDED. IN IN AN INDUSTRY BUT ALSO WE'RE GIVEN EXPANDING. THE WAY THAT WE SHARED THIS INFORMATION NOT ONLY IN THE CLASSROOM BUT ALSO WITH FARM WORKERS AND PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THAT ARE HERE TODAY OF. ROUTINELY IN IN- SEX WHERE WE SHARE. OUR- KNOWLEDGE. AND RESPECT. WITH MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY INTO PARMA IN THEIR THEIR EFFECT. IN ANY INTEREST FOR EVEN IN ONLY DO FULL WHAT ON THE TECH ROLE. AT THE FAR. BUT ALSO TRAIN SOME OF THE FAR MORE THAT ARE. ON THE GO IN FIELD ACCERN. SEEN THE SEASON IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN OPEN UP THESE THE CAN ALSO. THEIR MANAGER THEIR PCA'S- IN A WAY THAT WE GET MORE PROACTIVELY CAN AND IMPORTANTLY RESPOND TODAY. THE THING THAT HAVE SO I WANT TO THANK- ALL. FOR THE SUPPORT THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN. TO US FOR THE S. B. ONE SEVENTY AND I WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT. THE RESEARCH IS DEFINITELY NEEDED. THIS IS THE FUNDING OF WHAT A LOT OF COULD TAKE THEIR RESEARCH AND COME UP WITH MORE. OF A START THE FEATURES MORE SYSTEMATICALLY IN A WAY THAT WE CAN LOOK. COME UP WHEN NOT ONLY WAITED A SHORT TERM SOLUTION BUT ACTUALLY MORE ROBUST ALTERNATIVE THAT. WOULD BE MORE- AT FIFTEEN EVEN IF THE THEM TO DITCH. IN THE CLASS THAT WE SEE FOR YEAR TO YEAR WE IDEAS COME UP WITH ALL. THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARY. E OVERTAKEN BY THE POWER OR NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE FACT THAT THE WEATHER CHANGED FROM ONE YEAR THE OTHER ONE BUT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE IT. IS FACTORED IN THE WAY TO COMING UP WITH ALTERNATIVES WHAT ALSO SUPPORTING OUR LOCAL- STUDENTS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT I APPRECIATE ALL THE- SUPPORT THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US. ABSOLUTELY DOCTOR REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY SO INFORMATIVE AND- LOOK FORWARD I WAS. YOU KNOW HOW TO BE CONVERSATION WITH. OUR STAFF AND WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ALL OF THE MATERIALS THAT- YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN SHOWN HERE IT'S INCREDIBLY VALUABLE TO REALLY. APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONING THE WORK FORCE OPPORTUNITIES WE JUST HAD A- A PREVIOUS HEARING- THIS MORNING- HIGHLIGHTING YOU KNOW AG TECH IN THE FUTURE. OF AGRICULTURE AND THE POTENTIAL RUN OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS AND YOU KNOW AS WE SEEK TO TRAIN THE NEXT. THE GENERATION TO WORK- IN AGRICULTURE SO REALLY APPRECIATE YOU EMPHASIZING SOMETIME ON THAT- AND SO WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE TO OUR LAST MEMBER OF THIS PANEL OF A- OF THIS PANEL. RIGHT NOW I'VE ALREADY FIGURED OUT HOW TO WORK. THE AIR. I HAVE IN THE CENTER MODE AND I'M NOT SURE HOW THE- IT GOT OUT YOU KNOW. YEAH I KNOW OUR TEAM BUT I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT IT- IT LOOKS FINE ON OUR END AS WELL. OKAY OKAY GREAT PERFECT SO HEY- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR- ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT- SOME OF THE RESEARCH AND SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE CONDUCTED HERE ON TRIPS AND- IMPATIENCE NIKADA BOTTLERS IN A RESEARCH ENTOMOLOGIST WITH USDA AND KILLING US. I STARTED HERE IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND THIS IS BECOME REALLY A TOP PRIORITY FOR MY RESEARCH PROGRAM TO REALLY SUPPORT THE LEAFY GREENS INDUSTRY HERE IN THE SALINAS DOLLARS. DR SO REALLY BRIEFLY I THINK A LOT OF YOU HAVE SEEN PICTURES OF MINE AND HE JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF THE BACKSTORY OF THE VIRUS WAS FIRST DESCRIBED IN THE NETHERLANDS IN THE EIGHTIES- AND IT WASN'T REPORTED UNTIL TWO THOUSAND SIX'S RICHARD SMITH MENTIONED IN IN HIS PRESENTATION MONTEREY COUNTY IN LOTUS- AND THEN FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE SAW SOME REALLY MINOR TO SEVERE ISOLATED OUTBREAKS IT WASN'T REALLY UNTIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE WE ONLY STARTED TO SING THE RECEIVE THE RE EMERGENCE OF THIS VIRUS. AND SEVERE OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT MONTEREY COUNTY- AND SOME OTHER COASTAL LETTUCE REGIONS- AND AS MARY MENTIONED UP TO A 100% CROP LOSSES- A BIG- ECONOMIC IMPACT AND ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS TO MARK NATION ALL JUST REITERATE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST REPORT OF THE DESERT LET DISTRIBUTION REGION SO IMPERIAL AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES THAT REPORTED- THIS VIRUS AS WELL AS IN YOU MIND TALKING TO ARIZONA SO THAT SUGGESTS THAT THIS VIRUS IS SPREADING TO OTHER LETTERS PRODUCING REGIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY I DON'T THINK IT'S RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION HERE- BUT THIS VIRUS WAS ALSO DESCRIBED IN LOTUS PRODUCTION INCREASED SO- AS A WHOLE THIS THIS VIRUS IS BECOMING. MORE ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT IN LEAFY GREENS NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA BUT OTHER REGIONS AS WELL KILL ANYTHING THAT WE LEARN HERE FROM THE RESEARCH CAN DEFINITELY SHED LIGHT IN TERMS OF MANAGEMENT. FOR OTHER REGIONS AS WELL- I'M JUST GONNA GO THROUGH A BUNCH PICTURES- I THINK SEEN ON OF WOMEN THIS POINT SO MAYBE ALREADY. TRANSPLANT BUT THIS THE FINAL BY THIS IS A LUNATIC IN THIS. PICTURE RIGHT HERE REALLY THE BROWNING ON THE LEADS STARTING OF THE GROWTH YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT SIDE- MOTION THOSE PLANTS ARE INFECTED THERE'S ONE THAT LOOKS HEALTHY ON THE TOP RIGHT CORNER- MY FEELING IS IT IS PROBABLY IS INFECTED AS WELL. IT'S JUST A SYMPTOMATIC SELF ALSO BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME PARALLELS IN HOW WE- THINK ABOUT COVERAGE BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY HELPED ME. UNDERSTAND THIS VIRUS FROM- IN LETTUCES WALLS. HOW THIS IS SAME HILDA ARE NOW FIELD TWENTY TWENTY YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE SWEET ALYSSUM WHICH IS A- A BENEFICIAL PLANT- THAT'S PLANTED IN THERE AND THAT'S REALLY TO ATTRACT. BENEFICIAL INSECTS PREDATORY INSECTS TO TRY TO MANAGE THE ROPES NATURALLY- YOU CAN SEE THERE'S- A WIDESPREAD AMOUNT OF VIRUS INCIDENTS THROUGHOUT THIS FIELD- THIS FIELD WAS A 100% CROP LOSS BY THE TIME- IF CAME TO HARVEST. SO NEXT FIVE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WHICH ALL OF THE SAME THING IN CERTAIN AREAS- SOME OF THOSE PLANS FOR A BIGGER ALL THE OTHER ONES THAT ARE STUNTED AND SMALLER- THOSE ARE INFECTED WITH IMPATIENS NECROTIC. SPOT FIRES. NEXT AND INTO THE NINE WE REALLY WANT SOME- EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES TO UNDERSTAND THE MOVEMENT OF THIS VIRUS AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS QUITE SURPRISING IS- HOW EARLY THIS VIRUS CAN BE INTRODUCED WITHIN A FIELD AND SO THIS IS A PRETENDING FEEL- STAGE. OF A LETTUCE CROP AND- THAT'S PROBABLY OUT ABOUT THREE THREE TO FOUR WEEKS OF GROWTH AND YOU'RE ALREADY SEEING VERY STRONG SYMPTOMS. OF THIS VIRUS SHOW UP ON A NEXT SLIDE. THAT SAME FIELD WE JUST MONITOR THE SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FIELD. ON THE ENTIRE CROP CYCLE WAS ABOUT NINE WEEKS THAT'S ABOUT AS FAST AS- YOU'LL GO FROM PLANTING TO HARVEST- IN THE SALINAS VALLEY IN KNOX AROUND YOU KNOW SUMMER. LATE SUMMER- AND THIS WAS A 100% CROP LOSSES WELL ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT. INTENSITY OF LETTUCE PRODUCTION IN THIS REGION IS- IS QUITE QUITE INTENSE AND SO IT'S NOT. A MONO CROP THAT IS PLANTED AS THERE'S A LOT OF LOCATIONS THAT ARE HEAVILY RELIED ON. AND ON A PER ACRE BASIS YOU CAN GET MULTIPLE PLANTINGS OF WHAT IS WITHIN THE SEASON ITSELF. JUST BECAUSE ONE ONE SECTION IS QUICK OUT OF THE CLEAR EARLIER ON IN THE SEASON DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOUR NEXT PAINTING WILL BE AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE SAW HERE. IS REALLY THE MOVEMENT OF THE BUYERS THROUGHOUT THIS ONE FIELD. BUT IT ALSO IMPACTED CHIU NEIGHBORHOOD FIELDS THAT WERE PLANTED RIGHT AFTER THIS. EXCELLENT I AND THEN THIS IS REAL OUR ARCHITECT SO MISTER. NOT BY YOU CAN TOUCH THE VICE YOU CAN TRANSMIT THAT IT'S NOT ME CAN'T TRYING. THAT'S ACTUAL FRASER IT. IS ACTUALLY TRANSMITTED BY THE IMPACT WHICH IS THE WATSON PARKER'S. WHICH AS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR INTRODUCTION INTO VERY SMALL INSECTS SO ONE U. TWO MILLIMETERS- YEAH AND THAT'S A VERY EARLY. A LETTUCE PLANT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND I'VE JUST HIGHLIGHTED HOW SMALL THESE INSECTS ARE- IN ADDITION THEY LEAVE A LOT OF FEEDING DAMAGE OF THOSE ARE THAT'S DAMAGE SUCH CALLS FROM FEEDING BY THE INFECTED CELL. AND BRINGS UP THE POINT THAT IN ADDITION TO JUST ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT THE VIRUS HOUSE- THERE'S ALSO- BEATING ALL LOSSES JUST THEIR DAMAGE COSMETIC DAMAGE THAT'S- INFLICTED BY THIS IMPACT IN A LOT OF THIS CHANGES. NOT ONLY WITHIN THE U. S. BUT IT ALSO HAS DEPENDED ON STANDARDS SET BY THE EXPORT MARKET WHICH IS STRONGLY LIMITED. MATERIALS THAT ARE GROWERS AND PCAS CAN USE- AND THAT ULTIMATELY AFFECTS REALLY- THE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THAT ARE INDUCED INDUSTRY CAN IMPLEMENT FIVE HOURS AGAIN DISMISSED TRACTORS JUST HIGHLIGHTING. REALLY THE INFESTATION THAT. CAN OCCUR AT A VERY EARLY STAGE- VERY BRIEFLY I'M GONNA SPEND TOO MUCH ON HERE THE POINT IS BOB DOLE CHIU SMALL THE FOURTEENTH CAN LIE. HUNDRED OF DAYS THROUGHOUT HER LIFE CYCLE AND THEY HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF DEVELOPMENT TEMPERATURES SO BETWEEN FORTY FIVE AND A HUNDRED AND FOUR DEGREES- THIS INSECT WILL CONTINUE DEVELOPING CONTINUOUS LIFECYCLE- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THE WESTERN FLOWER THRIPS IS GOT. A LOT OF FLOWERS AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE- THEY'RE CALLED THE WESTERN FLOWER THRIPS. SO ANYTHING THAT FLOWERS A LOT NOT FALL INTO THE HOST RANGE THE NUMBER OF PLANTS THAT CAN SUPPORT THE WESTERN PARTNERS IS IN THE HUNDREDS- IN TERMS OF HOW OF IRISES SO MERRY TOMATOES WILT VIRUS AND THAT'S ANOTHER VIRUS- THAT HAVEN'T QUITE REACHED ECONOMIC LEVELS IN LETTERS BUT- AFTER FAMILIAR WITH TOMATO PRODUCTION IN CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S BECOME A PROBLEM IN THAT REGION. ON THE SAME THING JUST LIKE FOR US WE KNOW THAT THE HOST RANGE FOR I. S. B. SHOWS. THE NUMBER OF PLANTS THAT CAN BE INFECTED BY THE VIRUS IS ALSO IN THE HUNDREDS. AND SO IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT A MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE ON REDUCING. HABITAT STILL LIMITED. VOTES THAT CAN SUPPORT EITHER INTACT FOR THE VIRUS BECOMES EXTREMELY. OVERWHELMING AND SHALL- AND THEN THIS IS JUST KIND OF FOLLOW UP TO ORDINARY SAID ABOUT. OF IDEA TEMPERATURES IN THIRDS POPULATIONS AND SO I JUST PUT THEIR GENERALLY THAT THE LETTER SEASON IN OUR REGION RUNS. ALL THE CRIME REALLY MONTHS ARE FROM MARCH TO NOVEMBER AND THEN IT SWITCHES DOWN TO IMPERIAL AND RIVERSIDE. DURING THE WINTER TIME AND SO THERE'S QUITE THIS INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE TWO PRODUCING REGIONS BUT- WE DID HAVE A COOLER CLIMATE WITH COOLER TEMPERATURES THIS PAST YEAR AND THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN SEE- FROM THAT BLACK ONE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND REALLY IT'S THE WEATHER THAT **** DISORIENTATING FASTER DEVELOPMENT AS I MENTIONED IN A FEW SLIDES AGO. CELL HIGH POPULATIONS GENERALLY INCREASE IN PROGRESS THROUGH. THE WARMER MONTHS NEXT FIVE. I AM NOT SURE CORE. FOR HOW WE- DEVELOPMENT STAR. OF THE- AS WELL NEXT FIVE. AND THEN FROM THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SLUGS STUDY ON THE SHOWING THAT THAT PLANTING SLOT WAS BETWEEN JUNE AND SEPTEMBER- AND AS I MENTIONED YOU CAN GET MORE THAN ONE PLANTING ON A PER ACRE BASIS AND SO. ONE THERE ARE STILL MONTHS OUT MUNSTER GO IN THAT SEASON AND SO ALL THE FIELDS. AROUND THAT SUFFERED JUSTICE HARBINGERS OF THE VIRUS- ANYWAYS JUST TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME PERSPECTIVE ON ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE ALREADY TRIED TO DO TO UNDERSTAND THIS VIRUS AND THE FACT- TEMPERATURES. OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS ON THIS REPORT FROM ONE OF THE LOCATIONS- IN SALINAS AND SO ON AVERAGE. OF THE HIGH AIR OF THE HIGH TEMPERATURE AND LOW TEMPERATURES HAVE INCREASED OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. AND JUST REFERRING BACK TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL THRESHOLDS FOR THRIPS DOCTRINE THAT RED LINE AS- YOU CAN SEE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO OVER THE PAST. TWENTY YEARS- DOCTOR HOLD- IS NOT REAL IS THE TEMPERATURES ARE NOT BELOW THAT THRESHOLD AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEVER ACTUALLY GET. A BREAK IN THE REPRODUCTION OF THIS INSECT. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WORSE HISTORICALLY MAYBE POPULATIONS WERE SUPPRESSED IN THE WINTERTIME. WORSE NOW WILL WE CONTINUE TO SEE ACTIVITY EVEN WHEN NOT THIS IS NOT PRESENT IN THE BALLOT- MANAGE CHALLENGES I BROKE IT DOWN INTO THREE PIECES AND I THINK I WANTED TO DO IT THIS WAY BECAUSE I THINK IT HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPLEXITY BEHIND US. BUT WE TALK ABOUT THE DIRECTION MANAGEMENT OF THREATS ALL THESE POINTS ARE NOT- ARE FAMILIAR TO YOU ALREADY BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT- BUT- HIGHLY REPRODUCTIVE SMALL INSECTS. THIS IDEA NGUYEN TRAVEL WE'VE DONE SOME STUDIES WERE REDUCING TARIFFS TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH IN THE WIN COLUMN SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT TRYING TO PT IT VERY ORDER SUPPRESSING POPULATION. I'M COMING INTO A FIELD THAT BECOMES INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT IF THEY'RE MOVING THAT HIGH UP IN THE WIN COLUMN. AS MARK MENTIONED VERY LIMITED CHEMICAL OPTIONS- AND ALL OF THIS AFFECTS NOT ONLY WHAT'S AVAILABLE BUT ALSO THIS IDEA OF RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT. AND THEN THE LARGE HOST RANGE WE TALK ABOUT THE VIRUS NEXT SLIDE- THERE ARE NO DIRECT METHOD FOR PREVENTING OR TREATING THE VIRUS SO IF WE THINK ABOUT PROVISIONS. BAXEEN SOCIAL DISTANCING MASKING YOU CAN'T DO THAT FOR PLANTS RIGHT AND SO. HOW DO WE MANAGE THE VIRUS- AND CREATING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DO THIS- WE WERE ALSO NOT AT THE POINT WHERE YOU SEE A LOT OF GENETIC RESISTANCE IN BY THIS VARIETIES AND SELF JENNIFER MENTIONED IN HER SLIDE. ON A LOT OF THE EFFORTS ARE GOING INTO BREEDING WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS A LONG TERM. STRATEGY FOR MANAGING THE VIRUS BY GENERATING GENETIC RESISTANCE BUT THAT'S JUST NOT AVAILABLE WIDELY TO THE INDUSTRY AT THIS POINT- AND AGAIN THE LAST PART IS DOES THE HOST RANGE- IDEA FOR THIS VIRUS SO. NEXT SLIDE AND THEN. FINALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AS A WHOLE SO WHEN YOU BRING TRIPS AND I NEED TO BE TOGETHER I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT TRANSMISSION OCCURS WITHIN MINUTES OF FEEDING ALLOWED US. CONSERVE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE INHERENT DESPERATE THIS IDEA OF MOVEMENT IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE LIMITED CHEMICAL OPTIONS PRIMARILY. THOSE THAT ARE CONTACT COMMISSION DREES. IF YOU YES ALL YOU HAVE ARE CHEMISTRY AND CAN TAKE SOME MINUTES HOW DO YOU GET OF THIS THING AND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO DO THAT SO NEXT LINE AND ON TOP OF THAT- JUST TO CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH HERE OF COMPLEXITY IS THIS IDEA OF CALLING FACTIONS WITH AT THE END% WILL NOT. SLIDE SAME THING YOU'RE SAYING YOU SEEN THE SLIDE- OR EXAMPLES OF THIS BUDGET CAN I AND RICHARD WE TESTED. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PLANS MAYBE TEN PLANTS OUT OF THIS FIELD RANDOMLY PICKED. FROM THIS CORNER AND EACH ONE OF THEM HAD BOTH MINUS THE ENTIRE TEAM WILL. AND I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE IS THAT. WE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE TWO PATHOGENS AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND. IF ONE PATHOGEN IS MAKING THE PLANT MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTION BY THE OTHER THAN THAT MIGHT GUIDE US IN TERMS OF MANAGING ONE PASSED THE CHEN VERSUS THE OTHER- AS AN ENTIRE SYSTEM SO NEXT SLIDE- AND THEN FINALLY I AM FIVE. STRIPPED EVERYTHING AWAY AND JUST LAST RESEARCH PROGRESS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND WHERE SOME OF THE S. B. ONE SEVENTY FUNDS ARE GONNA BE USED TO ADDRESS. NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS BUT THE ENTIRE THING IS A HOLD ON THE NEXT SLIDE. SO FOR THRIPS- THIS IS SOME WORK THAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING A LOT OF IT IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEAFY GREENS. PROGRAM AND WE'VE BEEN REALLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE VERY GOOD SUPPORT FROM THEM SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHEN I STARTED SO. WE'RE UTILIZING PREDATORY INSECTS TO COMBAT BURKE CHAU RELEASING WHAT WE CALLED BENEFICIAL INSECTS WERE WORKING WITH THE COMPANY DOING DRUM RELEASES AND- SOME ORGANIC PRODUCTION. OUR MONITORING POPULATIONS WERE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND MOVEMENTS AND BEHAVIOR- WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME- HAZARDS THAT ARE BEING USED AND IF WE CAN MAXIMIZE THAT- USING SOME OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AS YOU SEE THERE ON THE RIGHT PROCEDURE INSPIRATION- MARC MIGHT BE ABLE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED BUT THE ESTIMATE IS THAT YOU COULD REDUCE IT DOWN TO ONE TENTH OF ALL IN. AT THE EARLIEST APPLICATION PHASE WHICH I THINK IS JUST SUPER EXCITING. WE TALK ABOUT I. S. B. NEXT SLIDE- WEED ABATEMENTS ON MARION RICHARD IF TALK BOTH AOUT THIS. QUITE EXTENSIVELY BUT A LOT OF THE RESEARCH. THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONDUCT HAS GUIDED A LOT OF THE STATE AND PRO- TO NAY. SOME OF THE- FOR THE FIRE- AND THEN. TO PLAY IMMUNE HIGH FIRES AND SO THE J. POINT BUILD A HEALTHY PLAN. A STRONG GROUP- CAN POTENTIAL HELP FIGHT OFF SOME OF THOSE- SLIDE- WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IMPROVING. PROGRAMS TO MONITOR. DOCTORING SO IDENTIFYING POPULATIONS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE THE PLAYERS. AND THEN- REALLY LOOKING AT THE INTERACTIONS AS I ALLUDED TO IN THE PREVIOUS. LIFE AND THEN THE LAST THING- IS REALLY NOVEL AND EMERGING BIOTECHNOLOGIES WRITTEN SECOND HE'S MANAGEMENT SO AREN'T ANY INTERFERENCE WAS ONE OF THE PROJECTS THAT YOU SAW IN JENNIFER'S PRESENTATION THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER PROJECTS THAT I'M WORKING ON. WITH USDA TO TRY TO BUILD ON THESE NEW TOOLS FOR US TWO YEARS AS WE CONTINUE TO. MOVE FORWARD AND GO THROUGH DIFFERENT REGULATORY PROCESSES- TO ACCEPT A LOT OF THESE- STRATEGIES AS WELL AS INTEGRATE THEM INTO MODELS SO. NEXT FIVE AND THEN WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS JUST HIGHLIGHTED. A FEW OF THESE IN READ THAT STAND OUT IN MY MIND FOR HOW- THIS FUNDING WILL BE USED AND I THINK THESE ARE ADDRESSING. THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING ADDRESSED HERE- BUT BUT THE BIGGER QUESTION ABOUT HOW THIS FUNDING MIGHT BE USED THIS IS HOW I'M SORT OF ENVISIONING IT. CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER PROJECTS THAT WE CAN PURSUE AS WELL. SO NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS JUST KIND OF A PER. SLIDES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT SO I MENTIONED COMMUTERS FATHER WILL VIRUS INTO METAL PROCESSING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE IPM STRATEGY THAT THEY'VE DEVELOPED- TO REALLY GET THIS OUT TO THE INDUSTRY AND THEY HAD AN EXCELLENT RESEARCH TEAM- TO PLANT PATHOLOGIST CHU ENTOMOLOGIST AND FIVE EXTENSION PERSONNEL. WORKING ON THIS- WHEN THE DISEASE REALLY STARTED SHOWING UP IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. RESEARCH BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THIS PAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND WHAT I'M REALLY JUST TRYING TO GET OUT AS YOU KNOW RESEARCH CAN BE A LONG TERM THING. YOU KNOW BUT WE HAVE TO STRATEGIZE WHAT IS A SHORT TERM GOAL AND A LONG TERM GOAL- AND IN THIS EXAMPLE IT WAS QUITE- QUITE A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO REALLY. BUILD SOMETHING THAT WAS ROBUST AND ADOPTABLE. BY THE INDUSTRY. HI SO WHY CAN'T WE USE SAME IN PART OF THE PARTY THE REALLY THE BIG REASON IS BECAUSE- THE CULTURE OF AGRICULTURE WITHIN OUR REGION AND SO OF THE SPECIALTY CROP INDUSTRY HERE IS VERY STRONG IT'S VERY DIVERSE AND VERY DYNAMIC AND SO I MENTION THIS IDEA OF CROP ROTATIONS- REALLY TO- TO- WITH LEAF BLOWERS AND HAD LESS BEING REALLY SOME OF OUR BIGGEST- CROPS WITHIN OUR REGION YOU LOOK AT THE CONTRIBUTION THAT'S COMING OUT OF MONTEREY COUNTY IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT TO SECURE- BOTH THE STABILITY OF BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE THESE CROPS TO STAYING UP LATE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE FUTURE. FIVE JUST REALLY MY LAST FLIGHT HERE JUST LOOKING AT IBM FROM A HOLISTIC. STANDPOINT AND SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT- I THINK ABOUT THAT I THINK JP AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS ROOM BEHIND ME THINKS ABOUT. AS OUT WERE NOT JUST CENTERED IN THAT GREEN CIRCLE WITHIN THE MIDDLE THERE THAT SAYS TAX MANAGEMENT. BUT WERE INVOLVED IN ALL OF THESE OTHER PARTS TO REALLY DEVELOP SOMETHING THAT IS. ACCEPTABLE SOCIALLY ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY. AND THE TOOLBOX FOR MANAGING NOT ONLY HONEST BE. TESTING AS WELL AS GOING TO HAVE TO BE VERY DIVERSE AND VERY ROBUST AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SO I THINK THAT MY LOS- YOU AFTER THE QUESTION WE ARE RECEIVING FUNDING FROM MY HOME AGENCY U. S. D- BUT GREAT SUPPORT FROM A LOT OF OTHER AGENCIES- AS WELL AND THEN A LOT OF COLLABORATORS THAT WE DROPPED INTO SOME OF THESE PROJECTS TO SUPPORT THIS RESEARCH SO. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. WELL THANK YOU DANIEL I REALLY APPRECIATE WE'RE UP AGAINST TIME AND- GOING TO GET- WE HAVE TO BE OUT OF THIS ROOM HERE MOMENTARILY BUT I REALLY WANT TO THINK- YOU KNOW ALL THE PANELISTS TO WANNA THINK THE WORK. THAT HAS BEEN DONE ONE THING THE GOAL SHIPPER ASSOCIATION IN MARIN COUNTY FARM BUREAU ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE HAS BEEN- INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- AND YOU KNOW AS WAS MENTIONED BY MARK THAT WE HAVE A DISASTER ON OUR HANDS AND THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT WE HAVE YES THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE- IT YOU KNOW HAPPY THAT- YOU KNOW THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED BY- YOU KNOW THE- STATE BUDGET- FROM- THIS CURRENT YEAR- HOPE THAT THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT BUT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THIS IS A THREAT TO- THE PRODUCTION YOU KNOW A VERY SUCCESSFUL. SO PRODUCTION IN THE SALINAS VALLEY I IT'S A THREAT TO YOU KNOW THE JOBS THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS HISTORICALLY- PRODUCED THERE IN- THE SALINAS VALLEY. AND SO CERTAINLY AS A STATE WE NEED TO TAKE A VERY- A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO A PARTNER. WITH THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY. TO SEE HOW WE CAN OVERCOME MANY OF THESE CHALLENGES BUT AGAIN THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING THE TIME THANK YOU FOR. THE INFORMATION AND AS ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU- AND WITH THAT- VICTOR DO WE- HAVE LINES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILL OPEN UP- THIS. ROOM FOR MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE WHO WISH TO MAKE COMMENTS. SEE NON- WILL MOVE TO THE PHONE LINES ARE THERE- SOME PHONE LINES OPEN. IF YOU LIE TO- TAKE A COMMENT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. YOU HAVE A COMMENT COMING IN ONE MOMENT. ON WHY. YEAH WE GO TO LINES SIXTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS DAN GLEASON CAMPUS FROM THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR BIODIVERSITY. THANK YOU CHAIR FOR PULLING TOGETHER THIS VERY FRIGHTENING AND VERY IMPORTANT- HEARING I'M SURE WE'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT IT I JUST WANT TO OFFER OUR SERVICES IF YOU HAVE THAT CALIFORNIANS COULD YOU PROVIDE A PERSON WHO WERE WORKING SCIENTISTS TO- TO DNA BARCODE FUND G. INSECTS AND PATHOGENS STATEWIDE. AND AND THE TO ADVANCE REALLY SOME REALLY HIGH TECH DETECTION TECHNIQUES THAT ARE- USING META BARCODING AND I'M SURE MANY OF THE SPEAKERS TODAY- ARE AWARE OF THAT ADVANCED STUFF AND I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN DEVELOP THESE TOOLS AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO TRYING TO BE AN INSISTENCE ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF IT- THAT TODAY HAD A REALLY GOOD HEARING ON. BUILDING TAX TRAINING TRACK- FOR THE AGRICULTURE I'M SORRY MISSTATING IT BUT ESSENTIALLY- TRAINING- YOUNG FARMERS IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES- TO SOLVE PROBLEMS DIRECTLY LIKE THIS AND I DO HOPE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS AND BILL- I WILL BE ABLE TO PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND FIND A WAY TO GET CSU AND OTHERS INVOLVED. IN SOME SOLUTIONS HERE THANK YOU. THANKS FOR COMMENTS. OPERATOR THERE ANY OTHER CALLS THE QUEUE. AT THE TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN Q. FANTASTIC AND WITH THAT WE WILL STAND ADJOURNED.
