REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLY- ONE OF OUR

GRASSROOTS GROUPS IS THE

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:35.377
CONSCIENCE OF THE REPUBLICAN

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:37.713
PARTY. I THINK THAT WE COULD

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.783
SAY VERY. VERY CLEARLY TODAY

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:43.051
THAT DOUG HOLLAND. WAS THE

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:45.120
CONSCIENCE OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:48.490
REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLY CAUCUS.

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.058
THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT THINGS

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:52.594
IT COULD BE SAID ABOUT DOUG.

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.396
AND MANY OF THE MEN REV

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:57.366
REFERENCED. BY MY COLLEAGUE

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:59.668
FROM RANCHO CORDOVA BUT FARM

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:06.375
BOY. VETERAN TRUSTED ADVISER

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:07.776

FRIEND GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:19.988
SOMEONE WHO ALWAYS HAD.KNOWLEDGE TO BRING TO THE TABLE

01:14:20.055 --> 01:14:21.223
BUT HE COULD DO IT IN A WAY

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:24.193
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU LAUGH.

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:26.328
GRANDFATHER BELOVED GRANDFATHER

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:28.730
AND UNCLE. MANY DIFFERENT

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:30.833
THINGS THAT WERE PART OF WHO

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:36.505
DUG WAS. BUT I THINK THAT. WHAT

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:38.607
WAS GREAT ABOUT DOUG IS THAT HE

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.776
CAME TO CALIFORNIA. IN HIS

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:44.012
TWENTIES AND STARTED OUT YOU AS

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:45.848
A AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.416
ACTUALLY RUNNING A SECURITY

01:14:47.482 --> 01:14:51.687
SERVICE. BUT HE DECIDED. THAT

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:53.255
HIS REAL PASSION WAS FOR PUBLIC

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.892
SERVICE. AND SO YOU KNOW IN IN

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:59.328
THOSE MID TWENTIES HE MADE THE

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:02.631
CAREER DECISION. TO BECOME PART

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:05.000
OF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS HERE

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:06.235
TO COME AND WORK IN THE

01:15:06.301 --> 01:15:09.037
LEGISLATURE ON BEHALF OF THE

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:09.638
ISSUES THAT HE CARED ABOUT SO

01:15:09.705 --> 01:15:12.341
MUCH THEN HE SPENT THE NEXT

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:15.210
TWENTY SEVEN YEARS HERE IN THE

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:17.679
LEGISLATURE DOING JUST THAT.

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:18.247
AND MAKING SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:23.185
GAINES. I LOOK BACK. AND

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:24.353
THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:26.655
THAT HE IMPACTED POLICY FROM

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.924
FORESTRY ISSUES TO WATER ISSUES

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:30.826
HE WAS A KEY PLAYER IN THE

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:32.361
WATER BOND DISCUSSIONS AND

01:15:32.427 --> 01:15:33.328
NEGOTIATIONS IN TWO THOUSAND

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:38.533
AND NINE TO. DUSTIN'S LAW YOU

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.868
KNOW WHICH WAS NAMED AFTER HIS

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:42.504
GRANDSON WHO WAS MURDERED. AND

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.139
DOUG TOOK THAT PAINFUL

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.641
EXPERIENCE AND TURNED IT INTO

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:48.710
PUBLIC POLICY. THAT HELPS KEEP

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:51.546
CHILDREN SAFE AND THE STATE.

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:54.049
THE OTHER THING I THINK ABOUT

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:54.650
WHEN I THINK ABOUT CALLING HIS

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:56.852
MENTOR. AND DOUG ALWAYS HAD

01:15:56.919 --> 01:16:02.824
TIME. FOR OTHER PEOPLE I ALWAYS

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:04.293
HAD TIME TO GIVE OF HIS

01:16:04.359 --> 01:16:06.828
KNOWLEDGE TO. YOUNGER

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:09.197
GENERATIONS- TO OTHER PEOPLE

01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:10.299
THAT WERE WORKING WITH HIM IN

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:13.235
THE POLICY CAUCUS AND IF YOU IF

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:16.071
YOU TALK AROUND. THE STAFF OF

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.372
OUR CAUCUS SO MANY PEOPLE WILL

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:19.207
TELL YOU THAT THEY WERE

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.509
MENTORED IN SOME WAY. BY DOUG

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:22.978
COLLINS. NOW I THINK ABOUT MY

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:25.747
OWN LIFE- IT'S REALLY KIND OF

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:27.316
FUNNY HOW DOUG POPPED UP IN MY

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:30.319
LIFE. I FEEL LIKE IN IN

01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:31.687
CRITICAL JUNCTURES I REMEMBER

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:34.489
AS A- AS A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:35.757
AS THE FUTURE FARMERS OF

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:37.893
AMERICA MEMBER YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.595
SEEN THESE- YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:41.930
COMING INTO OUR CAPITAL WITH

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:43.198
THE BLUE JACKETS I WAS ONE OF

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.599
THOSE AND I REMEMBER VISITING

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:46.268
THE CAPITAL AND WE GOT TO SIT

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:49.004
DOWN WITH DOUG COLLINS. LEE

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:50.806
WHEN HE WAS THE CHIEF OF STAFF

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:51.974
AND I STILL THINK BACK TO A

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.643
STORY THAT HE TOLD WHERE HE WAS

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:57.012
TALKING ABOUT. IT WAS KIND OF

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:58.847
MY FIRST LESSON IN MESSAGING.

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:01.350
WHERE DOUG SAID YOU KNOW. A LOT

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:02.150
OF TIMES AGRICULTURAL GROUPS

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:03.418
COE IN AND THEY TALK ABOUT

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:04.219
THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEY TALK

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:06.455
ABOUT. OTHER CROPS AND THAT'S

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:08.190
GOOD BUT YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY

01:17:08.256 --> 01:17:10.559
TO BRING IT HOME. TO EVERYDAY

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:12.461
FOLKS INTO THE BROADER PUBLIC

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:14.730
AND SO HE USES AN EXAMPLE- FOR

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:17.032
EXAMPLE IN THE MILK PRICES AND

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:18.867
MILK. POLICY GOES IT'S NOT JUST

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.736
HOW IT AFFECTS THE DAIRY FARM

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:22.504
BUT TALK ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS-

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.606
MOMS YOU KNOW YOU ARE BUYING

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:27.209
MILK FOR THEIR CHILDREN- AND

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:28.877
MAKE IT A BROADER. HELP MAKE IT

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:30.112
MORE APPLIED TO A BROADER

01:17:30.178 --> 01:17:31.713
STATEMENT HE WAS RIGHT. BECAUSE

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.316
SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO AND FOOD

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:36.251
POLICY IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.320
FARMERS THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US.

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:41.656
BECAUSE WE ALL NEED FOOD D. N.

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:42.557
I REMEMBER A LITTLE BIT LATER

01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:43.859
IN TIME WHEN I WAS A AN

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:45.927
ASSEMBLY FELLOW. AND SERVED IN

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.262
THE ASSEMBLY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:49.598
IN THIS BODY. AND DOUG POPPED

01:17:49.664 --> 01:17:51.033
UP ONCE AGAIN YOU KNOW AS AS A

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:53.935
KEY CONSULTANT- ON NATURAL

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:57.005
RESOURCES. AND MY MENTOR AT THE

01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:58.707
TIME WAS CINDY HILLARY WHO NOW

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:01.843
RUNS OUR BUDGET- POLICY- AND

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:02.978
DOUG WAS THE KEY CONSULTANT

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:04.846
WORKING ON FORESTRY IN A- HELLO

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.281
REALLY ALLOW MARK FORESTRY AND

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:09.251
FIRE PROTECTION- LEGISLATION

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:10.152
FIRST OF ITS KIND THAT ALLOWED

01:18:10.218 --> 01:18:12.888
US TO. TO THIN MORE TREES AND

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:14.523
HAVE BETTER MANAGEMENT

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.658
PRACTICES IN THE FORCE DOUG-

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:18.360
WAS KEY TO THAT NIGHT AND I AND

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:19.428
I CAN RECALL DOUG BEING IN THE

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:22.230
OFFICE. SO MANY DIFFERENT TIMES

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:24.566
WITH THE HUMOR WITH THAT WITH.

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:27.269
BUT ALWAYS YOU KNOW. IT WAS

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:29.471
SAID IN A BIO ABOUT HIM THAT

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.206
DOUG ALWAYS STROVE TO EDUCATE

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:33.008
IN A RESPECTFUL AND POSITIVE

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:35.177
WAY AND I THINK THAT'S SO TRUE.

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:37.145
IN A CONVERSATION WITH DOUG

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:38.580
MOST OFTEN LEFT ONE MORE

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.749
KNOWLEDGEABLE. THAN BEFORE IT

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:43.452
BEGAN. BUT IN THAT PROCESS I

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:44.886
TELL YOU WHAT HE WOULD BE YOU

01:18:44.953 --> 01:18:47.456
WOULD BE LAUGHING- BECAUSE HE

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:48.990
HAD JUST AN AMAZING SENSE OF

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:51.693
HUMOR AND A WAY TO CONNECT- AND

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.894
THAT WAS PART OF HIS MENTOR

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:54.096
SHIP I THINK HE BROUGHT PEOPLE

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:56.031
IN. HE ATTRACT THE ATTRACTED

01:18:56.098 --> 01:18:57.566
PEOPLE TO HIMSELF BUT HE ALWAYS

01:18:57.632 --> 01:19:00.836
PASSED ON. A KNOWLEDGE AND THAT

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:02.637
WAS SUCH A KEY PART. A FEW DOUG

01:19:02.704 --> 01:19:05.841
WAS. HE WAS DEVOTED TO HIS

01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:10.245
MOTHER. WHO WAS A BIG- FIGURE

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:11.746
IN HIS LIFE ANY ALWAYS

01:19:11.813 --> 01:19:13.348
AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO EACH

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.517
OF HIS SONS EVEN AFTER THEY

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:20.122
WERE GROWN MEN. AS SWEETHEART.

01:19:20.188 --> 01:19:21.623
DOUG WAS A PRINCIPLED MAN WHO

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:22.924
BELIEVE THERE IS NOTHING MORE

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:25.393
IMPORTANT THAN PROTECTING. THE

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.563
ONES THAT YOU LOVE. AND I GOT

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:32.134
TO SEE. THAT AND DUG ANOTHER

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.736
MOMENT THE TO I DON'T EVEN

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:35.370
MAYBE NO HE KNOWS ABOUT AYE AYE

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.305
ATTENDED TO. A CHURCH SERVICE

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:39.040
ONE TIME WERE ACTUALLY GOT TO

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:41.409
HEAR DOUG GIVE HIS TESTIMONY-

01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:46.948
TO THE CHURCH. AND THE. YOUR

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:49.251
CRIES CHANGE DOES LIFE AND I

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:50.852
GOT TO HEAR A VERY PERSONAL-

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:54.823
TESTIMONY FROM HIM- THAT DAY

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:55.957
AND IT WAS ALWAYS ANOTHER THING

01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:57.726
THAT JUST STUCK WITH ME ABOUT

01:19:57.792 --> 01:20:00.495
DUG IN AS WE- NOW. WHEN I
