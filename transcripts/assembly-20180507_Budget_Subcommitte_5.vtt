WILL BE A GRANT FUNDED PROGRAM

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:09.392
TO DO.

00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:11.394
THE SEC

00:52:11.461 --> 00:52:12.496
AND SO IF A.

00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:12.662
IF.

00:52:12.729 --> 00:52:14.264
.

00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:16.166
A COMMUNITY A CITY IT COUNTY

00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:18.635
WANT TO APPLY THEY CAN APPLY.

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:20.136
BOB THE ONLY REQUIREMENT WILL

00:52:20.203 --> 00:52:22.372
ASK IS IS THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:24.074
ASIDE SOME MONIES TO HAVE SOME

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.609
SKIN IN THE GAME DILUTED DECIDED

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:26.843
THAT WANT TO BE INVOLVED. THE

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.478
PROGRAM YEAR YOU'RE MENTIONING

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:29.813
PROBABLY WOULD. WOULD DEFINITELY

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.715
QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY

00:52:31.781 --> 00:52:32.816
EXPANDING.

00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:33.984
FUNDING OF DEBT TO HELP AT RISK

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:35.452
YOUTH

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:36.753
AND SO THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.922
ARM PROGRAMS THAT COULD APPLY

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:39.489
FOR FUNDING FROM JUST UNDER

00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:42.058
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:43.226
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS JUST

00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:45.262
STONE.

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:46.663
THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO JOIN WITH

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:47.831
YOU ON THIS IN THIS IS ON THERE

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:49.866
A VERY VERY MUCH HOPE. THAT THIS

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:52.102
BODY WILL WILL PUT FORWARD IT'S

00:52:52.168 --> 00:52:54.004
IT'S TRULY AN INVESTMENT. IN

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:55.772
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SHORT

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.974
CHANGED IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:52:58.041 --> 00:52:59.242
FOR FAR TOO LONG WE WE DON'T

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:00.844
TALK ABOUT RACE.

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:01.845
ANYMORE IT'S NOT POLITICALLY

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:03.513
CORRECT.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.814
WHICH IS A REAL SHAME AND IT

00:53:04.881 --> 00:53:07.651
LEADS TO VERY DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:53:07.717 --> 00:53:08.952
IN SOME OF OUR MOST UNDERSERVED

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.320
COMMUNITIES.

00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:12.055
WE SHOULD NOT BE SHOT THAT IF WE

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:13.990
GO IN I KNOW YOU'VE TOURED JUNE

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:15.692
OF FACILITIES AND THE JAILS. AND

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:17.561
IT'S MOSTLY YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN

00:53:17.627 --> 00:53:19.329
OF COLOR WHO ARE THERE BECAUSE

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:20.997
OF IMPLICIT BIAS AND SOMETIMES

00:53:21.064 --> 00:53:21.965
EXPLICIT BY.

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:24.100
AND PUTTING MONEY.

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:25.368
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:26.603
THERE'S FOR DIVERSION PROGRAMS

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:27.737
ARE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND TO

00:53:27.804 --> 00:53:28.672
ME A DIVERSION PROGRAM IS A

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:30.140
PREVENTION PROGRAM.

00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:32.042
BECAUSE TAKING A CHILD WHO HAS

00:53:32.108 --> 00:53:33.677
MADE A MISTAKE IN COMING FROM

00:53:33.743 --> 00:53:35.812
VERY. DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.080
THEIR OWN TRIBE IT'S THEIR OWN

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:38.715
TROUBLES IN THEIR FAMILY AND

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:40.283
GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.219
ATONE FOR WHAT WENT WRONG BUT

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:45.121
REALLY. HELPING THEM.

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:46.790
UNDERSTAND THAT BE ABLE TO RE

00:53:46.856 --> 00:53:48.158
INTEGRATE TO NOT TOUCH JUVENILE

00:53:48.224 --> 00:53:49.993
HALL TO NOT TOUCH THE PROGRAMS

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.795
THAT WE KNOW EXACERBATE THE

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:52.629
RECIDIVISM RATES HERE IN

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:54.497
CALIFORNIA. IS TO ME WHAT THIS

00:53:54.564 --> 00:53:56.466
INVESTMENT IS ALL ABOUT AND WE

00:53:56.533 --> 00:53:57.567
CAN EITHER CONTINUE SPEND

00:53:57.634 --> 00:53:58.702
OBSCENE AMOUNTS OF MONEY

00:53:58.768 --> 00:54:00.704
TO LOCK KIDS UP.

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:02.138
AND THEN LOCK THEM UP WHEN

00:54:02.205 --> 00:54:03.106
THEY'RE IN ADULTS AND AND KEEP

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:04.240
THOSE CYCLES GOING OH WE CAN

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:06.276
START TO BREAK THE CYCLE.

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:07.577
AND INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:10.246
A PRODUCTIVE WAY THAT ENSURES

00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:12.382
THAT THEY WILLNOT SUFFER FOR

00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:14.250
THE TRAUMAS THAT. THEY'VE BEEN

00:54:14.317 --> 00:54:16.286
EXPERIENCING THIS WORLD NOT PASS

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:17.621
THOSE PROBLEMS ON TO THE NEXT

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:18.922
GENERATION SO THIS HUNDRED

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:20.290
BILLION DOLLARS I REALLY WOULD

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:22.726
HOPE WOULD BE A. DOWN PAYMENT AN

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:24.260
EARLY AND MICHELIN VESTMENTS

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:26.663
THAT WILL PAY DIVIDENDS AND WILL

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.832
KEEP US FROM HAVING TO EXPAND.

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.567
HUNDREDS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:32.168
IN THE FUTURE.

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:33.670
LOCKING PEOPLE UP BECAUSE THAT'S

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:35.705
BEEN THE PATTERN FOR TOO LONG.

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.674
AND THIS WAS.

00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.509
THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM I THINK

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:41.111
THAT THIS IS THE SEED FOR REALLY

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:43.380
SEEING HOW WE CAN SHIP. THE

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:44.514
JUSTICE CONVERSATION CALIFORNIA

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.449
ESPECIALLY FOR THESE KIDS

00:54:46.516 --> 00:54:47.317
AND GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:48.985
THAT SO THAT WHEN OTHERWISE BEEN

00:54:49.052 --> 00:54:50.420
DENIED THEM SO.

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:52.589
I'M ENTIRELY WITH YOU ON THIS

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:54.324
THING SIR AND I HOPE THAT THIS

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.592
IS GOING TO BE A RECOMMENDATION

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:57.293
OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.695
AND REALLY PUSH IT WITH THE

00:54:58.762 --> 00:54:59.496
SENATE AND PUSH IT WITH THE

00:54:59.562 --> 00:55:01.064
GOVERNOR AND SEE THIS IS AN

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:02.232
INVESTMENT SHOULD DEAL IN

00:55:02.298 --> 00:55:03.166
ALIGNMENT WITH.

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:04.534
KINDS OF.

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:07.137
AND JUSTICE.

00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:08.705
REALIGNMENT REFORM THAT THE

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:10.040
GOVERNOR'S BEEN INTERESTED IN

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:11.641
AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF PUT

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:12.676
YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS

00:55:12.742 --> 00:55:14.077
THIS IS INSURING THAT WE'RE

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:16.179
GETTING TO THESE COMMUNITIES.

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:17.781
IN A WAY THAT WILL BE IMPACTFUL.

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:19.049
AND AND LEAD TO HEALTHIER

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.550
COMMUNITIES IN THE FEW.

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:23.019
YOU.

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:24.988
WELL I THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:27.123
ARE WE APPRECIATE THEM.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:28.892
THOSE WHO CAME SO FAR FROM OF

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:30.360
DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:32.462
APPEAR TO BASICALLY EMPHASIZE

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:34.698
AND SUPPORT THIS CONCEPT. OF

00:55:34.764 --> 00:55:36.132
THIS ITEM WILL BE TAKEN INTO

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:37.033
CONSIDERATION.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:37.734
CLEARLY.

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:40.203
MOST OF US HAVE SPENT QUITE A

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:41.504
BIT OF TIME WORKING ON THESE

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:43.073
PARTICULAR ISSUES WITH REGARDS

00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:44.741
TO BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. AND

00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:46.242
THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:47.544
THEY FACE AS WELL AS ALL OF THE

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.145
YOU FACE IN THE STATE.

00:55:49.212 --> 00:55:51.581
I THINK MOST OF US WERE AGHAST

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:53.717
WHEN WE DISCOVERED THE AMOUNT OF

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:54.250
MONEY WE SPEND IN JUVENILE

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:55.051
JUSTICE.

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:56.519
PUT IN FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED

00:55:56.586 --> 00:55:58.354
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR PER

00:55:58.421 --> 00:56:00.223
CHILD UP TO A FIFTY THOUSAND

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:01.991
DOLLARS PER YEAR PER CHILD. IT

00:56:02.058 --> 00:56:03.460
IS STAGGERING WHEN ONE THINKS

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:04.561
ABOUT.

00:56:04.627 --> 00:56:07.363
THAT LEVEL OF RESOURCES PUT INTO

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.065
ONE PLACE WITH THEM WITH THE

00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:10.533
KIND OF SICK LACK OF SUCCESS

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.402
THAT WE HAVE IN THAT SYSTEM.

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:14.337
SO THIS IS UP HERE IN

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:16.606
COMPARISON TO THAT IT'S ALMOST A

00:56:16.673 --> 00:56:18.174
DROP IN THE BUCKET REALLY WE'RE

00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:20.410
TALKING ABOUT. A WHAT IT TAKES

00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:22.345
TO KEEP FOR KIDS AND JUVENILE

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:23.847
JUSTICE AND COMPARISON TO THE

00:56:23.913 --> 00:56:25.682
REQUESTS OF THAT'S THAT WOULD

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:27.050
LOOKING AT A MORE YOU KNOW SO

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:29.085
IT'S IT'S SO. IT'S REALLY

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:30.053
INTERESTING IN TERMS OF WHAT WE

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:30.954
SEE.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.756
WE CAN DO A MILLION DOLLARS OF

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:35.759
FOR ALL. FOUR KIDS AND STILL IN

00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:36.793
IT WOULD LITTLE LITTLE SUCCESS

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.695
IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED SO UP

00:56:38.762 --> 00:56:39.896
WE WOULD EVER TAKE THIS ON A

00:56:39.963 --> 00:56:40.797
SERIOUS ADVISEMENT THAT WE'VE.

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:42.132
.

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:43.466
I TALKED ABOUT IT WE WITHOUT

00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:44.834
MISTER JONES SAWYER AND THOSE

00:56:44.901 --> 00:56:45.702
WHO CAME.

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.103
BECAUSE SOME WHAT WE HAVE TO

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:49.205
TURN THE TIDE. AND AND DO WHAT'S

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:50.974
MARK. A RATHER THAN JUST

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.308
CONFLICT DO WHAT WE DID WE KNOW

00:56:52.375 --> 00:56:53.643
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF. ALWAYS A

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:54.844
LOT OF FEAR MONGERING WHEN YOU

00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:56.513
TALK ABOUT NOT INCARCERATING

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.214
PEOPLE BECAUSE WE THINK

00:56:58.281 --> 00:56:59.549
INCARCERATION MAKES PEOPLE SAFE.

00:56:59.616 --> 00:57:01.184
BUT IT REALLY DOES NOT EVERY

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:03.153
COMMUNITY SUFFERS FROM T.

I THINK IS A STATE THAT HAS. HAS

00:58:40.416 --> 00:58:41.851
SOMEHOW ANOTHER BEEN IDENTIFIED

00:58:41.918 --> 00:58:43.419
AS THE STATE TO INCARCERATE MORE

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:45.355
PEOPLE THAN. ALL THE COUNTRIES

00:58:45.421 --> 00:58:47.190
IN THE WORLD THAT'S CALIFORNIA

THAT WE DO THIS IS A ONE SORE

00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:51.794
SPOT THAT IS NOT A BRIGHT SPOT

00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:53.496
FOR CALIFORNIA. A NONE OF US ARE

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:54.964
POLICE WITH ARC INCARCERATE

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:57.300

00:58:58.334 --> 00:58:59.502
EFFECTIVE SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN

00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:01.237
GRAPPLING WITH THAT. OF THE

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:02.739
OVERCROWDING THE TREMENDOUS

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:04.240
AMOUNT OF MONEY WE PUT INTO THE

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:05.842
OVER CROWDED SITUATION WE'RE

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:07.543
DOING OUR BEST TO TRY TO CHANGE

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:08.978
THE SYSTEM AND REFORM IT.

00:59:09.045 --> 00:59:10.847
AND WE'VE REDUCED OUR PRISON

00:59:10.914 --> 00:59:12.849
POPULATION WHICH IS GOOD BUT WE

00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:14.017
ALSO HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT

00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:15.485
WHERE WE REALLY REDUCE BECAUSE

00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:17.153
WE'RE NOT SENDING PEOPLE THERE.

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.087

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:18.621
EARLIER.

00:59:18.688 --> 00:59:21.124

INSTEAD OF.

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:16.431
BUT I DON'T BE HERE I'M HERE FOR

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:17.933
ANOTHER SIX YEARS I DON'T BE.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.267
THREE YEARS TALKING ABOUT THIS

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:21.069
AGAIN.

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:23.138
THE DOCTOR WEBER SOLA HOPEFULLY

01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:24.806
WEAKEN NAM. YOU GET SOME ANSWERS

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:27.009
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:29.077
LET ME LET ME SEE IF I I I I IF

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:31.213
I UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:32.147
THIS ISN'T IT EVERY QUEST WOULD

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:33.548
DISH NO DOLLARS.

01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:35.684
AND THEN YOU. PUT IT OUT TO BID

01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:36.952
AND THEN YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:38.153
IT'S GOING TO PAY FOR AND.

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.055
DOES SOUND LIKE.

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:41.223
THAT'S WHAT AND THEN WE FIND OUT

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:43.191
HOW IT SPENT IS THAT.

01:17:43.258 --> 01:17:44.693
WHAT NORMALLY HAPPENS LIFT YOUR

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.261
VISION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAPPEN

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:47.696
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW MEN TARA LET

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:49.998
ME TRY TO EXPLAIN AS SIMPLY THE?

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:51.233
PUBLIC WORKS. WHEN THE

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:52.834
DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIES THAT

01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:54.536
THERE'S A COST TO INCREASE AND A

01:17:54.603 --> 01:17:55.404
NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:57.005
THE SIX FOOT PROJECTS WE HAVE TO

01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:58.774
PREPARE A REQUEST TO THE STATE

01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.474
PUBLIC WORKS BOARD THAT

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:00.509
IDENTIFIES.

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:02.778
WHAT THE NEEDS ARE WHAT'S

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:04.579
CAUSING THE NEEDS ARE HOW THAT

01:18:04.646 --> 01:18:06.281
IMPACTS SCHEDULE AND ALL THE

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:07.749
ABOVE AND THEN THE?

01:18:07.816 --> 01:18:09.051
PUBLIC WORKS BOARD WOULD A

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:11.086
REVIEW THAT ACTION AND AND

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:12.721
EITHER PROVE OR ASK QUESTIONS OR

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:13.555
WHATEVER.

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:14.489
THEY'RE THEY'RE.

01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:17.125
ACTION ON IT ON IT WOULD BE SO

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:18.493
THESE PROJECTS ARE ALREADY

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.162
ALREADY OUT TO BID RA AND

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:21.696
THEY'RE UNDER UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:24.099
SO BECAUSE THE BIDS WERE BASED

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:25.534
UPON THE PLANS AS THE PLANS

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.302
ESTABLISHED AT AT THE TIME OF

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:29.304
BIDDING WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS THAT

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.005
THESE PLANS OF HAD TO BE

01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:32.541
ADJUSTED BECAUSE OF POOR ACT

01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:34.342
IMPORT DUTIES BY THE ANY FIRMS

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:35.677
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:18:35.744 --> 01:18:37.546
OR BECAUSE WE AND WE START

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:39.381
RENOVATION AND AND THIS WHAT

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:40.549
MAKES THIS PROJECT ESPECIALLY

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:42.350
COMPLICATED IS THAT SOMETIMES

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:43.018
WE'RE BUILDING BRAND NEW

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:44.519
BUILDINGS ALL THE TIME FOR GOING

01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:45.353
INTO EXISTING BUILDINGS

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.855
RENOVATING ADDING ON TO THOSE

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:48.323
BUILDINGS. AND THAT'S WHEN WE

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:49.724
FIND OUT THAT ONE THAT BUILDING

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:51.359
WAS BUILT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO EVEN

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:53.395
THOUGH THE PLAN SAY ALL THESE

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.030
ITEMS WERE BUILT TO CODE. WE

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.198
OPEN UP THE WALL AND YOU FIND

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:57.966
IT'S NOT THERE AND HOW THE FIRE

01:18:58.033 --> 01:18:59.468
MARSHAL IN THE CONTRACTOR THAT

01:18:59.534 --> 01:19:00.936
TIME GOT THE BUILDING SIGNED OFF.

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:03.205
I HAVE NO IDEA BUT THAT'S WHAT

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:04.873
THE FIRE MARSHAL NOW HOLDS US TO

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.975
TO REPAIR THAT SO IT'S NOT THAT

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.477
WE ARE CHANGING THESE PROJECTS

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:10.545
AS WE GO ALONG. IT'S THAT WE

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:11.746
FIND THESE UNANTICIPATED

01:19:11.813 --> 01:19:13.281
CONSEQUENCES AND HAVE TO

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:14.616
CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:16.818
CONTRACTOR TO WELL FIRST WE HAVE

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:18.153
TO WORK WHETHER ANY FIRM TO

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.188
DESIGN WHAT'S NECESSARY TO THAT

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.256
HAVE THE CONTRACTOR.

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:23.225
PRICE IT OUT IN NEGOTIATE WITH

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:24.126
CONTRACTOR TO GET THAT

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:26.128
ADDITIONAL WORK DONE. AND ALL

01:19:26.194 --> 01:19:26.962
THAT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:27.896
BEFORE WE CAN HAVE A FIRE

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:29.731
MARSHAL COME IN AND SAY YES THIS

01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:31.633
BUILDING IS READY FOR OCCUPANCY.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.135
SO THAT'S THE PHASE OF THESE

01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:34.402
PROJECTS THAT WERE IN THERE ARE

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:36.338
AS A CONTRACTOR THERE AND WE ARE

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:38.173
TRYING TO MANAGE AND MINIMIZE

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:43.912
THESE. IMPACTS BUT WE AS THE

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:44.513
EIGHTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:45.147
AUGMENTATION ALREADY IDENTIFIES

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:46.381
THAT'S THE PROJECT WE'VE HAD

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.049
IDENTIFIED TO GET TO THIS POINT.

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:49.784
WE'VE IDENTIFIED ABOUT FOURTEEN

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.586
OR THE PROJECTS THAT WE KNOW

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:53.321
WILL NEED FUNDING AUGMENTATION

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:54.890
SOMETIME IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:56.057
AND THAT'S PRIMARILY WHAT THIS

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:57.459
MONEY IS FOR THAT WE WOULD BE

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:58.360
GOING THROUGH THE PUBLIC WORKS

01:19:58.426 --> 01:19:59.628
BOARD TO GET THOSE AUGMENTATIONS

01:19:59.694 --> 01:20:01.263
APPROVED.

01:20:01.329 --> 01:20:02.631
A NOTE ON THE CONTINGENCY THE

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:04.065
REASON WHY THERE IS CONTINGENCY

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:05.200
BUILT IN THE SEVENTY THREE

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:06.968
MILLION DOLLARS IS BECAUSE OUR

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:07.736
INFORMATION FOR HOW MUCH MONEY

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:10.205
WE NEED. IS ONLY AS GOOD AS

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:12.207
EVERYTHING WE KNOW AT THE TIME

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:13.175
THAT WE PUT THESE ESTIMATES

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:14.943
TOGETHER SO BACK IN FEBRUARY

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.678
WHEN WE DEVELOP THESE ESTIMATES.

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:18.446
THE PHASE OF CONSTRUCTION WE ARE

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:20.682
IN ALLOWED US TO KNOW WHAT OUR

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.417
PROBLEMS WERE BUT IF THIS IS A

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:23.518
BUILDING THAT HAS THREE OR FOUR

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:25.554
MORE PHASES RENOVATION THAT WE

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.788
HAVE AN OPEN THE WALLS ON YET.

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:28.156
WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.224
UNFORTUNATELY THERE MAY BE

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:31.259
ADDITIONAL CHANGES. AND IF WE

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:32.327
DIDN'T PUT MONEY FORWARD INTO

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:34.296
THE PROJECT A INTO THIS REQUEST

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:35.564
AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:36.932
WE WOULD FIND THAT THE MONEY WE

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:39.034
ASK FOR WOULDN'T BE SUFFICIENT

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.569
TO GET US TO THE END. ANSWER WE

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:42.204
MAY STILL FACE SITUATION FOR THE

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:43.071
LEGISLATURE.

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:44.873
APPROVED A THIRTY OR FORTY

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.341
MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE ANY OF

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:47.676
THE PROJECT MAY STILL HAVE TO A

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:49.477
HALT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FISCAL

01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:50.879
YEAR INTEL A FURTHER INCREASE

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:52.814
COULD COME THROUGH. THIS IS OUR

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:54.482
EFFORTS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:56.218
PUT MONEY ASIDE FOR THE UNKNOWNS

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:57.319
WHICH IF THE ANNOUNCEMENT

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:58.653
MATERIALIZE NEVER GETS

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.921
APPROPRIATED BY THAT NEVER GETS

AN EARLY EARTH QUAKE WARNING

01:24:11.579 --> 01:24:13.148

COMING.

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:28.296
BUT IF THE DEVELOPMENT AND ROLL

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:30.031

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:31.232
HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:33.134
EFFECT OF A SET OF SUCH A SYSTEM

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:34.903
THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE

01:24:34.969 --> 01:24:36.538

USED A WE WILL HAVE MORE

01:24:49.651 --> 01:24:50.585
PROBLEMS THAN SOLUTIONS.

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:51.820
FOR EXAMPLE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

01:24:51.886 --> 01:24:53.321
THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT

01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:54.956

PEOPLE RUN OUT INTO THE STREETS

01:25:10.004 --> 01:25:11.739
AND CHAOS ENSUES.

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.752
AND BENEFITS OF THOSE OF THE

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:05.820
BASIC COMPONENTS OF IT.

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:06.220
I THINK THAT.

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:09.190
THE FUNDING.

01:27:09.257 --> 01:27:11.559
ESTIMATES FOR THE BILL DOWD AND

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:13.595
THE RECURRING COSTS HOPEFULLY

01:27:13.661 --> 01:27:14.829
THAT SORT OF SPEAKS FOR ITSELF

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:15.930
BUT IT BREAKS IT DOWN BY

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:17.632
DIFFERENT COMPONENTS PART OF

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:19.434
THAT INCLUDES WHAT WE'VE. WE'VE

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:20.768
ASKED FOR IN THE IN THE BUDGET

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:22.570
REQUEST FOR FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:23.338
FIVE MILLION WHICH IS TO

01:27:23.404 --> 01:27:24.806
COMPLETE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:27:24.872 --> 01:27:26.507
BUILD OUT FOR THE SEISMIC

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:28.042
SENSORS THAT DETECT THE

01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:29.744
EARTHQUAKE. AND AND.

01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:32.347
INITIATE THAT EARLY ALERT TO.

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:34.716
TO THE PUBLIC INTO CALIFORNIANS.

01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:37.118
IT ALSO CONTAINS IS YOU HAVE.

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:39.253
AS YOU'VE NOTED THE DIFFERENT

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.154
TYPES OF WAYS THAT IT COULD BE

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:41.589
FUNDED ENOUGH IT'S OKAY I'LL GET

01:27:41.656 --> 01:27:43.291
BACK TO THAT. AND.

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:46.194
IT TALKS ABOUT A TIME LINE FOR

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:47.829
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN WHEN FROM

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:48.763
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND GOING

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.798
FORWARD TO ROLL OUT THE SYSTEM

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:52.734
FOR REAL USE. AND THEN.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.769
THE VARIOUS RISKS AND BENEFITS

01:27:54.836 --> 01:27:56.004
OF AND THE PLAN KIND OF TAKING

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:57.772
OUT ALL AND RECOMMENDS THAT

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:59.040
CALLAWAY YES DO A FEW THINGS

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:01.542
FIRST IT RECOMMENDS THAT WE.

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:03.344
NEGOTIATE A FORMAL AGREEMENT

01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:04.579
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USE

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:06.781
ANOTHER BIG PARTNER AND

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:09.150
DEVELOPING THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN

01:28:09.217 --> 01:28:09.917
FOR MANY YEARS.

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:11.619
IT TALKS ABOUT US FINALIZING

01:28:11.686 --> 01:28:13.554
WHAT'S CALLED A TELEMETRY PLAN

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:14.322
WHICH IS.

01:28:14.389 --> 01:28:16.891
A TECHNICAL TECHNICAL TERM FOR.

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:19.060
HOW THE SENSORS IN THE GROUND

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:19.994
SPEAK TO?

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:21.729
YOU KNOW TALK TO THE

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:22.997
INFORMATION NETWORKING GET THE

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:24.866
ALERT OUT TO PEOPLE AND.

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:27.001
IT IT TELLS US TO ACCESS TO

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:28.670
WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:30.938
DIFFERENT FUNDING OPTIONS AND SO

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:32.373
WERE ALREADY WORKING ON THOSE

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.408
THINGS WERE NOT.

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:35.143
WAITING NOW THAT THE BUSINESS

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:36.411
PLAN IS OUT.

01:28:36.477 --> 01:28:38.246
WERE PROCEEDING AND I CAN SAY

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:39.847
THAT WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:40.882
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE UNITED

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:42.283
STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY WE'VE

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:44.085
ALREADY DEVELOPED A A DRAFT

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:45.586
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THE

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:46.854
TWO AGENCIES ARE WORKING THROUGH

01:28:46.921 --> 01:28:47.955
THAT RIGHT NOW.

01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:49.190
FORTUNATELY THE FEDERAL

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:50.792
GOVERNMENT RECENTLY ALSO

01:28:50.858 --> 01:28:52.427
ALLOCATE IT'S MORE FUNDS THAT

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:53.628
WILL HELP US BUILD THIS OUT IN

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:55.430
CALIFORNIA. THAT'S TALKED ABOUT

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:56.531
IN THE PLAN.

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:58.833
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF.

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.501
THINGS ARE COMING TOGETHER AND

01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:02.336
BOTH ENTITIES ARE VERY MOTIVATED

01:29:02.403 --> 01:29:04.172
TO MOVE FORWARD FORWARD QUICKLY

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:06.374
BUT CAREFULLY AND WHICH IS WHY

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:08.142
ON OUR ROLL OUT PLAN FOR TWENTY

01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:09.911
EIGHTEEN AND BEYOND. ITS TO DO

01:29:09.977 --> 01:29:11.446
THAT AND STAGES IT'S TO BUILD

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:12.814
FROM WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.282
SUCCESSFUL THERE'S A LOT OF

01:29:14.348 --> 01:29:16.017
ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:17.452
BEEN TESTING THE SYSTEM SINCE

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:19.420
TWENTY TWELVE I BELIEVE. AND SO

01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:21.055
WE WANT TO BUILDING CAPITALIZE

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:22.290
ON THAT WHAT WORKS.

01:29:22.356 --> 01:29:25.126
YOUR POINT ABOUT RELIABILITY IS

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:27.095
SPOT ON OF IT NEEDS TO BE SAFE

01:29:27.161 --> 01:29:28.629
IT NEEDS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:30.231
WILL WORK AND SO WE WANT TO

01:29:30.298 --> 01:29:31.733
BUILD THIS OUT OVER THE NEXT OUT

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:33.601
OVER THE COMING YEARS. LEARN

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:35.703
FROM THAT ROLL OUT AND FIX

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:37.138
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED SO

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:37.772
THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT IT'S

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:38.606
RELIABLE.

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.808
THERE ARE SOME USERS WHERE THAT

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:44.178
RISK IS PERHAPS LOWER.

01:29:44.245 --> 01:29:45.313
YOU KNOW AND.

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:45.880
AB OR FALSE ALARM TOLERANCE

01:29:45.947 --> 01:29:47.014
MIGHT BE A LITTLE HIGHER THAT

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:48.149
WOULD BE KIND OF ONE WAY WE

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:49.450
WOULD LOOK AT ROLLING OUT STAGES

01:29:49.517 --> 01:29:50.651
SO THAT WE CAN.

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:51.753
WORK OUT THINGS.

01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:53.955
BEFORE IT MOVES ON TO OTHER

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:55.256
AREAS THAT MIGHT HAVE GREATER

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:57.658
RISK WITH WITH FALSE ALARMS I'M

01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:58.760
IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING OPTIONS

01:29:58.826 --> 01:30:00.261
WHAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US IN THE

01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:02.296
BUSINESS PLAN WAS TO IDENTIFY

01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:04.298
THE PROS AND CONS. OF DIFFERENT

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:06.434
WAYS THAT THAT THIS COULD GO ON

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:07.435
A FEW A FEW.

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:10.404
YEARS AGO THERE WAS LEGISLATION

01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:11.739
THAT ACTUALLY DIRECTED CALLAWAY

01:30:11.806 --> 01:30:15.009
YES TO FIND NON GOVERNMENT FUNDS

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:17.245
FOR THIS THAT WAS CHANGED.

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:18.312
IN SUBSEQUENT PIECE OF

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:20.548
LEGISLATION TO ALLOW SOME OF THE

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:21.916
GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT THAT WE

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:23.785
HAVE DONE BOTH IN TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:25.219
AND WE'RE HOPING TO DO THIS YEAR.

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:26.888
BUT REALLY LOOK FOR SOMETHING

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:27.622
STABLE.

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:29.957
YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH AT WHICH

01:30:30.024 --> 01:30:30.691
MIXES.

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:32.160
PRIVATE SECTOR SOURCES AND

01:30:32.226 --> 01:30:33.361
OTHER THINGS AND ALSO A LINE

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:34.896
WHERE IT MAKES SENSE WHERE WILL

01:30:34.962 --> 01:30:37.098
THE BENEFITS MY IN THE SYSTEM

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:38.833
WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM AND HOW.

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.201
AND THEN LINE UP POTENTIAL

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.936
FUNDING SOURCES AGAINST THAT.

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:43.938
THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IS PROBABLY

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:45.406
VERY SMALL IF IT'S IF IT'S

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:46.741
SPREAD ABOUT DIFFERENT FUNDING

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:48.009
SOURCES IN TERMS OF WHAT EACH

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:49.844
PERSON MIGHT EXPECT BUT WE

01:30:49.911 --> 01:30:51.612
WANTED TO BE CAREFUL TO REALLY.

01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:53.147
KIND OF LOOK AT THE PROS AND

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:55.116
CONS AND LINE UP BENEFITS WITH

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:56.317
THE COST OF ITS OF THAT MADE

01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:57.985
SENSE WHATEVER WE DID. AND SO

01:30:58.052 --> 01:31:00.221
NOW AND THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WERE

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:01.255
ALREADY WORKING ON THAT WE'VE

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:01.722
HAD.

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:03.658
INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.426
MANY INDUSTRIES ON THERE'S A LOT

01:31:05.493 --> 01:31:06.861
OF INTEREST IN THE SYSTEM WE'VE

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:10.164
TALKED A LOT WITH. VARIOUS.

01:31:10.264 --> 01:31:10.698
.

01:31:10.765 --> 01:31:12.500
INDUSTRIES ABOUT THE BENEFITS

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:14.001
OF THE SYSTEM WE'VE SEEN IT WORK

01:31:14.068 --> 01:31:15.436
IN OTHER COUNTRIES WITH

01:31:15.503 --> 01:31:16.504
EARTHQUAKES THAT HAVE HAPPENED

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:18.272
IN JAPAN WITH MEXICO CITY. AND

01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:20.007
SO THERE IS A LOT BEHIND THIS

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:21.108
AND THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN

01:31:21.175 --> 01:31:23.644
CALIFORNIA AND NOW ARE ARE ARE

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:24.779
NOW THAT THE BUSINESS PLAN IS

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:27.448
OUT OUR INTENT. IS TO NOW GO AND

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:28.950
TAKE A DEEPER DIVE HAVE VERY

01:31:29.016 --> 01:31:30.551
DELIBERATE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:32.186
WE MIGHT FIND THIS WITH

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:34.021
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES THAT. MIGHT

01:31:34.088 --> 01:31:35.556
BE ASKED TO FIND IT AND THEN

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:36.891
WORK WITH YOU OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:37.758
IN AND.

01:31:37.825 --> 01:31:40.862
IN SHORT ORDER TO IDENTIFY WHAT

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:41.362
WHAT.

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:42.663
WHICH OF THOSE MIGHT WORK IN

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:43.965
AND GET THAT FINALIZED SO

01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:44.966
THERE'S A LOT THAT'S THAT'S

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:46.868
MOVING FORWARD THE BUSINESS PLAN

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:47.869
RELIGIOUS IS THAT.

01:31:47.935 --> 01:31:49.670
ARTICULATE SORT OF WHERE WE'VE

01:31:49.737 --> 01:31:51.639
BEEN AND WHERE WE'RE GOING AND.

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:52.573
AND.

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.609
YOU KNOW CALLAWAY ESSES

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:57.211
COMPLETELY INTENTION ON ON

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.746
MOVING FORWARD ON ON THOSE

01:31:58.813 --> 01:31:59.814
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WORK WITH

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:02.183
YOU OKAY IN THE FUTURE. INCOME

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.784
TO FINANCE

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:04.685
FELLOW. MOWING CURSING AT THE

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:05.920
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE

01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:07.455
DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS

01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:09.056
ON THE FUNDING AMOUNT BUT.

01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:10.391
WE CAN CURRENT WHAT'S BEEN

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:11.926
MENTIONED EARLIER BY THE CHAIR

01:32:11.993 --> 01:32:13.027
AND OTHERS.

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:14.495
WE DO HAVE THE BUSINESS PLAN

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:16.197
NOW HOWEVER THERE IS A LACK OF

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:18.900
SPECIFICITY THERE IN TERMS OF.

01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:20.735
EXACTLY WHAT THAT MIX OF FUNDING

01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:22.470
SOURCES WILL BE ANSWERED OF WHAT

01:32:22.536 --> 01:32:23.537
HOW THEY SHOULD BE STRUCTURED

01:32:23.604 --> 01:32:24.338
AND.

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:26.007
SO I THINK THERE'S THAT'S

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:26.607
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT THE

01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:27.708
LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO WANT TO

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:29.577
CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND OVERSEE

01:32:29.644 --> 01:32:31.078
AND CERTAINLY PLAYS INTO THIS.

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:33.080
BETTER QUESTIONS WHILE I'M WE

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:34.081
THINK IT'S PROBABLY REASONABLE

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:35.483
FOR THE GENERAL FUND TO BEAR A

01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:36.684
PORTION OF THE COST BECAUSE

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:37.518
THERE'S PROBABLY THAT PROBABLY

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:39.120
IS A GENERAL BENEFIT TO THE

01:32:39.186 --> 01:32:40.788
SYSTEM. BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:41.822
EXACTLY WHAT THAT BENEFITTED

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:43.391
BECAUSE IT SORT OF WE HAVEN'T

01:32:43.457 --> 01:32:44.292
DONE.

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:46.260
QUITE THE WORK NECESSARY TO

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:47.595
REALLY ASSESS HOW MUCH IS

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:48.763
GENERAL BENEFIT VERSUS BENEFIT

01:32:48.829 --> 01:32:50.431
FROM UP FOR THESE SPECIFIC

THE NEED TO UPDATE OUR OUR

STATUTE IS IMPORTANT.

01:41:55.909 --> 01:41:56.743
UPDATING THE STATUE WILL ALLOW

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:58.145
THE DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES TO

01:41:58.212 --> 01:41:59.947

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:05.252

01:45:32.759 --> 01:45:34.327
WITH CHP IS WALLS WITH DEFENSE

01:45:34.394 --> 01:45:36.997
BAR A THIS WOULD WOULD STRICTLY

01:45:37.064 --> 01:45:38.598
BE THAT THAT STATUTORY CHANGE. I

01:45:38.665 --> 01:45:39.900
THINK THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED

01:45:39.966 --> 01:45:41.835
BY DMV LAST YEAR WITH RESPECT TO

01:45:41.902 --> 01:45:43.303
THE COST OF OF UPDATING THIS

01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:44.538
FORMS.

01:45:44.604 --> 01:45:46.139
THE FORMS REFLECT WHAT THE

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:47.074
STATUTE SAYS NOT NECESSARILY

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.575
WHAT.

01:45:48.642 --> 01:45:50.711
SUPREME COURT CASE LAW SAYS.

01:45:50.777 --> 01:45:53.413
A AND SO THAT'S.

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.281
THAT'S WHERE THE WHERE THE

01:45:54.347 --> 01:45:55.615
REBELS WITH WITH APPROPRIATIONS

01:45:55.682 --> 01:45:57.017
WAS.

01:45:57.084 --> 01:45:58.418
THE COST OF UPDATING THOSE FORMS.

01:45:58.485 --> 01:46:00.554
WAS

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:01.722
PROBLEMATIC EDIT THE OF THE GIVE

01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:02.889
YOUR.

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:05.058
ESTIMATED COST FOR THAT.

01:46:05.125 --> 01:46:05.959
I'M SURE THEY DID I DON'T RECALL

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:07.394
OTHER RECALL WHAT IT IS YOU THAT

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:08.729
BECAUSE I I THINK FOR US TO PASS

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:10.197
SOMETHING.

01:46:10.263 --> 01:46:11.398
I'M NOT NECESSARILY AGAINST

01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:13.967
DOING POLICY IN BUDGET THIS.

01:46:14.034 --> 01:46:14.935
IT'S WHAT WE DO IS THAT WHAT

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:15.535
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO BUT IT'S

01:46:15.602 --> 01:46:17.070
WHAT WE DO. BUT I THINK GETTING

01:46:17.137 --> 01:46:19.706
AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH WE'RE ASKING

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:20.340
FOR THAT'S THAT'S THE THING THAT

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:21.308
THAT.

01:46:21.374 --> 01:46:23.243
THAT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND

01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:25.045
SOUNDS LIKE A WORTHY PROBLEM TO

01:46:25.112 --> 01:46:26.546
SOLVE BUT GETTING THAT. GETTING

01:46:26.613 --> 01:46:30.183
THE NUMBERS RIGHT. AND.

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:31.418
I DO UNDERSTAND DMV SAYS WHAT

01:46:31.485 --> 01:46:33.186
THE FORMS.

01:46:33.253 --> 01:46:34.988
MATCH WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS BUT

01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:36.890
IF THE STATUTE IS INFLUENCED BY

01:46:36.957 --> 01:46:38.825
THE SUPREME COURT SAY THIS IS

01:46:38.892 --> 01:46:40.527
WRONG THIS IS HOW YOU MUST ACT.

01:46:40.594 --> 01:46:42.763
I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THEY SAY

01:46:42.829 --> 01:46:43.330
OH WE SHOULD KILL THE POLICY

01:46:43.396 --> 01:46:44.164
BILL.

01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:46.266
BECAUSE IT COSTS THEM.

01:46:46.333 --> 01:46:47.601
MONEY THAT IT YOU ARE NOT SURE

01:46:47.667 --> 01:46:49.169
HOW IT HAPPENED BUT IT DID SO I

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:51.772
OKAY OKAY SO I TO ME TO GO DOWN.

01:46:51.838 --> 01:46:53.106
TO US TO RATTLE HERE BUT I SAW

01:46:53.173 --> 01:46:54.307
THIS AND WAS TRYING TO.

01:46:54.374 --> 01:46:55.575
THE SONG HAS TOGETHER BECAUSE I

01:46:55.642 --> 01:46:57.210
THINK I REMEMBER SEVENTY TWO

01:46:57.277 --> 01:46:59.412
WHEN IT WAS WHAT THEY WANT. OUR

01:46:59.479 --> 01:47:01.314
HOUSE LAST YEAR BUT.

01:47:01.381 --> 01:47:02.616
OKAY INTERRUPTED SO SIMPLE.

01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:04.084
DOESN'T YET BUT TURNED OUT TO BE

01:47:04.151 --> 01:47:05.185
A LITTLE CYCLE GOING THROUGH

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:06.887
HERE WE'RE GONNA NEED. TO

01:47:06.953 --> 01:47:08.555
UNDERTAKE OKAY WHAT THE MONEY IS

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:10.257
I WOULD THINK IN ORDER FOR US TO

01:47:10.323 --> 01:47:12.025
BE MAKING A RECOMMENDATION.

01:47:12.092 --> 01:47:13.760
SUCH A FAT OUT OF ANY ONE

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:14.327
ATTENDED THE APPS THAT WE'VE

01:47:14.394 --> 01:47:14.661
HEARD TODAY.

01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:16.730
THAT'S A FRACTION.

01:47:16.797 --> 01:47:19.132
SORRY SMALL AMOUNT.

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:21.501
ALMOST WHAT I CAN TO AT I KNOW

IT IS A PART OF IT AYE I'D.

01:47:22.969 --> 01:47:24.271
BUT THERE WAS SOME MONEY

01:47:24.337 --> 01:47:25.739
ATTACHED BUT ITS BASICALLY A

01:47:25.806 --> 01:47:27.107
POLICY ISSUE.

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:28.275
AND SO I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE

01:47:28.341 --> 01:47:30.143
OUT WHAT ELSE WAS IN SEVEN ó

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:31.812
TO THAT WAS THE HANG UP WAS AT

01:47:31.878 --> 01:47:33.647
THE. IF YOU TRY TO PRESCRIBE

01:47:33.713 --> 01:47:35.482
ADDITIONAL POLICY HAD TO DO WITH

01:47:35.549 --> 01:47:36.516
THE ADVISEMENT THAT'S THEN GIVEN.

AND WHAT THAT NEEDED TO BE AND

01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:48.028
WHETHER WE SHOULD SPECIFY IN

01:47:48.094 --> 01:47:49.963

IN STATUTE AND LEAVE IT UP TO

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:54.434

ADVISEMENT.
