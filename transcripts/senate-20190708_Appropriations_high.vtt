VERY SIGNIFICANT STATE INTEREST.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.438
IN MAKING SURE INSURANCE.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.340
LAWMAKERS CENTURY TWENTY HAVE

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:21.941
SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:22.909
MATTER.

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:25.278
THE UNUSUAL PART OF CALIFORNIA

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:30.183
ARE MUCH OF THE INSURANCE CODE --

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:32.652
IS ARISE FROM THE WORK OF A BODY

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.187
KNOWS ANY I SEE.

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:36.122
THEY MAKE MODEL LAWS THAT THEY

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.158
IT'S REALLY UNIQUE WITH OUR

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:40.960

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:46.799

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:48.434
THEY RUN ACCREDITATION PROGRAM

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.603
THEY HAVE EIGHTEEN STATUTES DO

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.806
TO ADOPT -- AND SO THIS BILL

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:54.941
JUST ADDRESSES.

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.809
IN A WORLD IN WHICH SO MUCH OF

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:57.877
OUR INSURANCE CODE IS BY

00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:00.613
DELEGATION TO A THIRD PARTY.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.881
THERE IS A PUBLIC INTEREST IN

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:04.217

THE EXPENSE OF THIS BILL

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.421

AND THEIR SCHEDULING OFTEN

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:19.932
CONFLICTS WITH OUR WORK.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.601

IDENTIFIED THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:02.054
WHO CREATED THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:02.755
HAZARD.

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:04.123
BECAUSE IF WE ACQUIRE AT THE

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.058
STILL HAVE.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.827
RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR THAT.

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:10.429
WHAT WAS A FORMER MARINE BASE SO

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:12.064
WE KNOW THE FORMER -- EL TORO

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:15.701
MARINE BASE THAT WAS -- DEEDED

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:17.937
TO THE CITY SO IT WOULD BE THE

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:19.271
CITY OF IRVINE THAT HAS THE

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:21.440
RESPONSIBILITY ONE OF THE THINGS

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:23.275
WE'RE WORKING ON IS LOOKING.

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:25.845
AT THE CLEAN UP -- ESTIMATE CAL

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:28.747
THAT CAME OUT TO DO A ANALYSIS A

00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:31.617
FEW YEARS BACK AND GAVE A COST --

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:35.354
AT THAT TIME WE DID NOT SPECIFY.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.989
HOW WOULDYOU MAKE A COSTS FOR

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:38.390
CLEAN UP FOR YOU IF YOU WERE

00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:41.260
USING IT FOR RETAIL OR HOUSING?

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:43.195
THERE COULD BE ONE ESTIMATE AS

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.630
FAR AS CLEANING UP BUTIF YOU'RE

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:46.832
USING IT FOR A BURIAL GROUND

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:47.867
WOULD THAT BE.

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:49.668
A DIFFERENT COST SO WE'D LIKE TO

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.137
LOOK MORE INTO THAT TO SEE IF

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:53.072
THAT WOULD REDUCE COSTS AND THEN

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:55.674
THE SECOND THING -- THAT WE'D

00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:57.743
LIKE TO LOOK AT IS -- THERE WERE

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.512
INITIAL TALKS ABOUT HAVING TO

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:02.214
REMOVE QUITE A LARGE AMOUNT OF

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:05.017
CEMENT FROM THOUGH -- THE ACTUAL

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:07.453
A RUNAWAY AND SOME SUGGESTIONS

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.954
HAVE BEEN COULD YOU ACTUALLY

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:11.824
BRING THE DIRT TO PUT IN ON TOP

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.025
OF IT VERSES REMOVING IT --

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:14.593
WHICH YOU WOULD PROBABLY NOT DO

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.929
IF YOU WERE HAVING IT BE RETAIL

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:19.031
OR HOUSING BUT IN THIS CASE FOR

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:20.432
A DIFFERENT PURPOSE SO THERE'S

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:22.368
STILL A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS TO BE

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:25.171
HAD ON AND ALSO.

00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:27.606
TO POSSIBLY LOOK AT ENTERTAINING

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:29.708

AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS A FAIR

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.179
QUESTION FOR MARCH PRINCE POINT

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:15.414
CHANGE BEHAVIOR.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.882
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.417
OTHER AMENDMENT THAT WE TOOK IS.

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:20.352
ON LIKE EVERY OTHER OFFENSE THAT

00:20:20.419 --> 00:20:22.120
IS LIKE THIS OR SIMILAR TO IT

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:23.555
DANGEROUS DRIVING ACTIVITY YOU

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:24.856
DON'T EVEN GET THE POINT ON THE

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:26.158
FIRST INFRACTION.

00:20:26.224 --> 00:20:27.793
SO NOT ONLY GET THE LONG LEAD

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:29.628
TIMEWE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ENGAGED

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:30.963
IN A IN A KIND OF A WIDESPREAD.

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:32.064
EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO HELP

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.365
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND YOU SHOULD NOT

BE DOING THIS ACTIVITY IT'S VERY

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:36.501
DANGEROUS THE RESEARCH SHOWS

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:38.370
THAT IS AS DANGEROUS AS DRIVING

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:40.772
WHILE INTOXICATED -- WHICH WE

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:42.608
HAVE A MUCH BETTER HANDLE ON AND

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:44.910
SO THE FIRST ONE IN THIS CASE IS.

00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:46.044
YOU YOU WOULD NOT GET A POINT

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:47.613
FOR THE FIRST INFRACTION IT'S

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:49.314
ONLY FOR THE REPEAT OFFENSE THAT

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:50.582
YOU WOULD GET THE INFRACTION AND

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:52.517
OF COURSE POINTS OR INFRACTIONS

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:53.385
FOR WHICH YOU'D GET A POINT

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:55.420
WHERE OLAF EVERY THREE YEARS AND

00:20:55.487 --> 00:20:57.189
SO IT'S KIND OF A REFER THIS.

00:20:57.255 --> 00:20:58.090
ONE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WILL

00:20:58.156 --> 00:21:01.093
ONLY GET KIND OF THE HARD CORE

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:02.194
OFFENDERS THAT.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.195
JUST DISREGARD THE LAW IN THIS

00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:04.796
REGARD.

00:21:04.863 --> 00:21:06.632
AND AND THE LENGTH OF TIME OF A

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:08.200
PRIOR CONVICTION.

00:21:08.266 --> 00:21:12.604

00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:16.541
ALSO.

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:18.276

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:19.344
YEAR VERSUS A?

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:20.479
CURRENTLY HOW WE DO IT WE'RE

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:23.315

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:32.340
THAT IS THE CRITICAL THING

01:18:32.407 --> 01:18:33.742
ENSURING THAT CUSTOMERS IN

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:39.548
PROTECTED.

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:41.016
STILL UTILITIES ARE THE BACKBONE

01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:42.417
OF OUR ECONOMY IN THE NECESSARY

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:45.754
BACKGROUND OF OUR DAILY LIVES.

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:48.056
CLIMATE CHANGE FOR WHICH WE ALL

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:49.891
SHARE RESPONSIBILITY.

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:50.859
HAS CREATED A NEW REALITY IN

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:53.595
CALIFORNIA. ONE CONSEQUENCE IS

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:55.197
THE WILDFIRES WHICH ARE MORE

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:56.731
FREQUENT MORE DANGEROUS AND MORE

01:18:56.798 --> 01:18:59.034
DESTRUCTIVE.

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:00.435
IN MANY INSTANCES UTILITIES HAVE

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:01.770
FAILED TO MAINTAIN THEIR

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:03.738
INFRASTRUCTURE RESPONSIBLY.

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:05.140
IN OTHER CASES UTILITIES HAVE

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:07.309
HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:09.177
CAUSED BY FILLED INFRASTRUCTURE

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:11.580
UNDER INVERSE CONDEMNATION EVEN

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:13.248
IF THEY DID NOTHING WRONG.

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:14.716
THESE TWO FACTORS THOUGH HAVE

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:17.285
COST THE BOND RATING AGENCIES TO

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:19.921
DOWNGRADE OUR UTILITIES. ONE

01:19:19.988 --> 01:19:21.356
WENT TO JUNK BOND STATUS AND

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.091
THEN BANKRUPTCY ANOTHER FACES

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:24.926
THE SAME PLATE THIS SUMMER IF WE

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:26.428

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:28.096
THE UTILITIES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:30.232
MAYBE CLOSE BEHIND AS THE MARKET

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:33.201
ACTIONS HAVE CASCADED AFFECT.

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.003
THIS LEADS TO INCREASE BORROWING

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:36.738
COSTS FOR THE UTILITIES.

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.240
WHEN THEY BORROW AS MAJOR

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:40.442
BUSINESSES DO THOSE INCREASES

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:42.677
COSTS THOSE INCREASED COSTS WILL

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:44.279
INCREASE CUSTOMER COSTS BY

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:45.947
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:19:46.014 --> 01:19:47.716
ANNUALLY?

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:50.118
THEIR ONLY ALTERNATIVE WILL BE

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:52.787
NOT TO OPERATE AT ALL AND GO

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:54.322
INTO BANKRUPTCY.

01:19:54.389 --> 01:19:55.924
AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WILL PAVE THE

01:19:55.991 --> 01:19:57.726
WAY FOR UNPRECEDENTED SAFETY

OF ALL LAWS WHAT FAR START IN

MLH UTILITIES ONLY 10%.

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:45.267
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THOUGH THE

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OF THE LAST.

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:49.504

THOSE EVENTS WERE STARTED -- BY

ELECTRIC UTILITIES.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:57.178
WHICH ALSO COVER THOSE -- THREE

01:21:57.245 --> 01:22:00.215
I'LL USE COVER 70% OF THE STATE.

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:02.083
SO WE HAVE A CHOICE -- WE

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:03.385
LEARNED DURING NINE OH ONE WE

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:05.620
HAVE ONE OF THREE OPTIONS -- WE

BANKRUPTCY.

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:16.031
WE REALIZE BANKRUPTCY IS NOT AN

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:17.365
OPTION WE'VE KNOWN THERE'S SOME

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.767
PROBLEMS WITH WAITING FOR THE

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:22.237
PAYERS.

SO WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS A

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:26.107
WAY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE

01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:29.244

WITH THIS AS WELL BECAUSE THIS

01:22:41.956 --> 01:22:43.825
IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IT IS

01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:45.493
NOT A PERFECT BILL THAT ANYBODY

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.961

TALK QUICKLY ON THREE OF THE

01:35:29.356 --> 01:35:31.325
ISSUES NOT ON THE STABILITY TO

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:32.026
THE UTILITY.

01:35:32.093 --> 01:35:34.295
BURKE ON A SAFETY.

01:35:34.361 --> 01:35:36.697
ON OUR RATE PAYERS IN ON VICTIMS

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:39.333

YOU DID IN SB NINE A ONE YOU

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:42.269
TAKE WHAT.

01:35:42.336 --> 01:35:44.505
JUDGE ELSA DID IN THE CPUC

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:46.907
ADOPTED. ONE AREA AND THAT THE

01:35:46.974 --> 01:35:47.641
WE WERE.

01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:49.176
MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IS TO MAKE

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:51.712
SURE THE SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS

01:35:51.779 --> 01:35:54.748
ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW THE TWO

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:55.783
FIVE TEN FROM YOUR YEARS FROM

01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:57.017
NOW IT THAT THEY'RE GOING ON

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:58.552
WITH THIS NEW DEPARTMENT THAT'S

01:35:58.619 --> 01:35:59.386
BEEN CREATED.

01:35:59.453 --> 01:36:00.421
THEY'RE GONNA HIGHER WHILE FIRE

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:02.490
SAFETY STAFF WE CAN BE ASSURED

01:36:02.556 --> 01:36:03.757
THIS GOES ON IN THE FUTURE IN

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:05.292
THIS JUSTIN AND SOMETHING NOW

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:07.862
THAT TAKES PLACE WITH THE FIVE

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:09.597
BILLION DOLLARS IT'S IN PLACE.

01:36:09.663 --> 01:36:11.065
WITH THE MORE TARGETED

01:36:11.132 --> 01:36:12.733
ANALYTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:13.567
WITHIN IT.

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:15.169
WE FEEL MORE CONFIDENT THAT

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:17.037
THEY'RE LESS LIKELY FOR OTHER

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:18.072
VICTIMS TO GO THROUGH WHAT WE

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:19.073
WENT THROUGH.

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:19.974
ON RATE PAYERS HIGHLY

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:22.643
COMPLICATED BUT WE AND THAT

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:24.178
BASICALLY THINK SUBSTANTIAL

01:36:24.245 --> 01:36:26.847
SAVINGS EVEN IF YOU TAKE THE T.

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:28.849
W. R. CAPITALIZATION. THIRTY

01:36:28.916 --> 01:36:29.917
DOLLARS A YEAR YOU TAKE THAT AS

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.185
AN INCREASE WHICH SOME PEOPLE

01:36:31.252 --> 01:36:32.153
WOULD ARGUE.

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:39.727
SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS FOR P.

01:36:39.793 --> 01:36:40.161
JEANNIE CUSTOMERS.

MAJOR SAVINGS FOR EDISON

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:42.830
CUSTOMERS.

01:36:42.897 --> 01:36:44.832
AND MAY BE FLAT TO INCREASE FOR

01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:46.066
SD ANY CUSTOMERS OF WHAT THEY

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:47.134
GET IN LIABILITY IN THE

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:48.402
STABILITY IT PROVIDES THEIR BEST

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:49.537
RASPY ANY WE CAN WALK THROUGH

01:36:49.603 --> 01:36:50.237
THE COMPLEXITY ON THAT.

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:51.572
BUT AND HOW YOU GET THERE BUT

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.941
THEY TAKE AWAY THE DEEP THE THE

01:36:54.008 --> 01:36:55.676
CAPITALIZATION OF SECURITIZATION

01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:57.111
OUR RATE PAYERS THEY PUT IT ON

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:58.179
UTILITY.

01:36:58.245 --> 01:36:59.713
THEY TAKE AWAY THE PROFIT ON THE

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.782
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IF WE GOING

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:03.484
TO JUMP AND STATUS JULY TWELFTH.

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:05.119
THE COSTS GO UP AND IF THERE'S

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:06.687
NO FUND MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:08.155
WITHIN THE FINE AND FINALLY FOR

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:19.133
THIS IS JUDGE MONTALE GOING ON

THE EVALUATION THE TAKES PLACE.

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:38.385
IS WHAT'S GOING TO PAY FUTURE

01:37:40.387 --> 01:37:41.689
GOING TO PAY FOR FUTURE VICTIMS

01:37:41.755 --> 01:37:44.091

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH

01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:51.131
SHOULD BE AFTER THE CALIFORNIA

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:53.234
COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES.

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.935
THERE'S TWENTY TWO THOUSAND

EDISON WITH ANOTHER TWENTY

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:05.346
THOUSAND RETIREES THE PROVISION

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:07.381
OF THIS BILL THAT WE CARE MOSTLY

01:38:07.448 --> 01:38:09.984
ABOUT IS THAT IN EXISTING LAW.

01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:11.485
THERE IS.

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:13.053
A REQUIREMENT THAT WHEN THERE IS

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.488
AN ACQUISITION.

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:15.889
OR A MERGER.

01:38:15.956 --> 01:38:18.592
OF A UTILITY OR TELECOM.

01:38:18.659 --> 01:38:20.261
THE P. YOU SEE HAS TO DO A

01:38:20.327 --> 01:38:23.097
REVIEW AND ENSURE THAT RATE

01:38:23.163 --> 01:38:24.965
PAYERS ARE PROTECTED.

01:38:25.032 --> 01:38:25.599
THE T..

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:27.334
THE THE A MERGER OR ACQUISITION

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:29.603
IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:30.237
PUBLIC.

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:32.873
THAT IS FAIR AND REASONABLE. TO

01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:33.974
EMPLOYEES.

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:36.243
IN ABOUT FIVE OR SIX OTHER.

01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:38.112
PUBLIC INTEREST RELATED FINDINGS

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:39.513
THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE.

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.415
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THAT

01:38:41.482 --> 01:38:43.550
PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO

01:38:43.617 --> 01:38:45.085
PARTIAL SALES.

WHO ARE OWNING AND OPERATING OR

01:38:48.522 --> 01:38:49.456
UTILITIES.

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:51.825
THE FEAR IS THAT THEY WILL START

01:38:51.892 --> 01:38:54.762
TO CHOP UP AND SELL ASSETS IN

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:56.330
ORDER TO OBTAIN CASH.

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:58.732

A PRIVATE OR PUBLIC ENTITY.

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:07.341
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:08.642
PROCESS.

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:11.812
IS -- IS ACHIEVED IN THAT IS IN

THIS BILL.

01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:16.216
THAT IS SO IF THERE'S HUGE

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:19.219
CAUTIOUS TO OTHER REPAIRS THE P.

01:39:19.286 --> 01:39:20.487
YOU SEE CAN PULL MONEY OUT OF

01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:22.056
ANY SALE AND MAKE SURE THAT GOES

01:39:22.122 --> 01:39:24.224
TO HELP AND TO UNDERWRITE THOSE

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:25.459
RATE PAYERS.

01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:26.727

01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:50.751
TWO THOUSAND WHEN YOU SAID THAT

01:44:52.185 --> 01:44:53.220
RATE WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN IF

01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:55.022

GO OFF TO THE OUT OF STATE

01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:57.357
GENERATORS THAT WOULD LOWER THE

01:44:57.424 --> 01:44:58.925
RATES.

01:44:58.992 --> 01:45:00.360

01:46:40.393 --> 01:46:41.661
SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:42.896

IN FIRES TO SOME SORT OF

01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:58.578

GO AHEAD. FIVE PICKING UP ON THE

01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:24.271
QUESTION ABOUT FIRE SAFETY IN

01:47:24.337 --> 01:47:26.106
THE ABILITY TO REDUCE OUR BUYERS

01:47:26.173 --> 01:47:27.741
IN THE FUTURE HAS A LOT TO DO

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:29.176
WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF THE

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:30.544
UTILITIES TO DO HARDENING.

01:47:30.610 --> 01:47:32.679
WE HAVE A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:34.648
AMOUNT DOUBTS YEAH YOU KNOW

01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:36.316
STATED HERE GOES THE HARDENING

01:47:36.383 --> 01:47:38.485
IS THAT REALLY ENOUGH BASED ON

01:47:38.552 --> 01:47:41.521
WHAT WE KNOW.

01:47:41.588 --> 01:47:43.123
I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:47:43.190 --> 01:47:45.659
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD --

01:47:45.725 --> 01:47:47.861
SOME CONTRIBUTION TO THAT THERE

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:49.596
WAS GUARANTEED FROM THESE

01:47:49.663 --> 01:47:51.231
UTILITIES I THINK THAT WE ARE

01:47:51.298 --> 01:47:53.633
BELIEVE THAT -- WILL GET US A

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:56.436
LONG WAY DOWN THE ROAD AND SO --

01:47:56.503 --> 01:47:57.671
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT IS

01:47:57.737 --> 01:47:59.239
SUFFICIENT AT THIS POINT BUT YOU

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:01.074
KNOW AS WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GIVING

01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:02.509
OUR BEST EFFORT TO TRY TO

01:48:02.576 --> 01:48:04.344
UNDERSTAND HOW TO TO STAY AHEAD

01:48:04.411 --> 01:48:05.011
OF THESE.

01:48:05.078 --> 01:48:06.646
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN THE

01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:08.281
IMPACT THAT THEY SEEM TO BE

01:48:08.348 --> 01:48:09.282
HAVING ON COMMUNITIES.

01:48:09.349 --> 01:48:11.318
THE RANGERS SEEMS TO BE HUGE

01:48:11.384 --> 01:48:12.552
FIVE BILLION TO THIRTY BILLION

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:14.187
IS ANOTHER NUMBER AND HIM BALFE

01:48:14.254 --> 01:48:15.822
NOT PLUGGED INTO WHAT WE'RE

01:48:15.889 --> 01:48:17.958
PROVIDING HERE AND I'D LIKE TO

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:21.361
ASK AND IF MY TIME IF I THINK IF

01:48:21.428 --> 01:48:22.529
EMPLOYERS SAY ON IT.

01:48:22.596 --> 01:48:23.563
GET IT WOULD YOU RUN OVER THE

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:24.598
NUMBERS ONE MORE TIME FOR ME

01:48:24.664 --> 01:48:26.433
BECAUSE WHEN YOU STARTED YOU

01:48:26.499 --> 01:48:28.201
SAID TO THE WE HAVE THE

01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:29.870
INSURANCE FUND WHICH IS GOING TO

01:48:29.936 --> 01:48:32.138
BE THE PREFERABLE -- VEHICLE IN

01:48:32.205 --> 01:48:34.074
ITS TEN AND A HALF BILLION

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.709
DOLLARS THAT SHAREHOLDERS.

01:48:35.775 --> 01:48:37.177
IS TEN I HAVE BILLION FROM THE

01:48:37.244 --> 01:48:39.779
SURCHARGE AND THEN WE GOT TO

01:48:39.846 --> 01:48:41.147
FORTY MILLION AND SOMEHOW I MISS

01:48:41.214 --> 01:48:42.515
WHAT HAPPENED IN BETWEEN THERE.

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:43.850
THE FORTY BILLION OF THE

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:45.585
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWENTY

01:48:45.652 --> 01:48:47.153
NINE AND THE FORTY COMES FROM

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:47.988
TWO SETS OF THINGS ONE IS

01:48:48.054 --> 01:48:49.022
BASICALLY.

01:48:49.089 --> 01:48:50.323
THE VALUE TO CLAIMS PAYING

01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:52.192
RESOURCES OF CAPPING THE PAY

01:48:52.259 --> 01:48:54.094
OUTS -- TO INSURANCE THAT ARE

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:56.162
RECOVERING COSTS SO THAT'S THE

01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:58.465
BIG CONTRIBUTOR THE OTHER ONE IS --

01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:00.533
IS RE INSURANCE AND THAT IS A

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:02.936
SMALLER ELEMENT BUT BUT THAT'S

01:49:03.003 --> 01:49:05.939
THAT'S HOW WE GET FROM TWENTY

01:49:06.006 --> 01:49:08.375
ONE TO FORTY BILLION OF CLAIMS

01:49:08.441 --> 01:49:10.176
PAYING CAPACITY.

01:49:10.243 --> 01:49:11.811
THEN -- ANOTHER QUESTION BEFORE

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:12.946
I TAKE ALL THE TIME.

01:49:13.013 --> 01:49:15.081
IF STATED IN THE LEGISLATION OR

01:49:15.148 --> 01:49:17.384
THE ANALYSIS ANYWAY HAT IS RATE

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:19.386
PAYER NEUTRAL EXPLAIN HOW THAT

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:21.154
HAPPENS Là IN THE PRESENT AND

01:49:21.221 --> 01:49:21.988
THE FUTURE.

01:49:22.055 --> 01:49:23.723
OF THE RAPIER NEUTRAL COMPONENTS

01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:25.358
SPEAKS TO THE CONDITIONS THAT P.

01:49:25.425 --> 01:49:27.027
GENIE IS GOING TO HAVE TO MEET

01:49:27.093 --> 01:49:29.696
BEFORE HAS ACCESS. TO TO THE

01:49:29.763 --> 01:49:33.333
FUND SO BEFORE -- P. JEANNIE CAN

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:35.669
HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUND -- P.

01:49:35.735 --> 01:49:38.238
JEANNIE HAS TO HAVE A PLAN OF

01:49:38.305 --> 01:49:39.339
REORGANIZATION.

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:40.540
BY NEXT BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF

01:49:40.607 --> 01:49:42.108
NEXT YEAR THAT IS APPROVED BY

01:49:42.175 --> 01:49:43.376
THE COURT AND THAT IS APPROVED

01:49:43.443 --> 01:49:44.311
BY THE PC.

01:49:44.377 --> 01:49:46.413
THE UC HAS TO CERTIFY THAT IT

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:48.181
MEETS A SERIES OF CONDITIONS

01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:49.649
INCLUDING THAT IT BE RATE PAYER

01:49:49.716 --> 01:49:53.119
NEUTRAL THAT IT PROVIDED -- FOR

01:49:53.186 --> 01:49:54.487
FOR COMPENSATION TO VICTIMS --

01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:56.623
IN FULL IN THAT MANNER -- IN THE

01:49:56.690 --> 01:49:59.326
MANNER -- APPROVED BY THE COURT

01:49:59.392 --> 01:50:02.062
THAT IT -- THAT PROVIDE THE

01:50:02.128 --> 01:50:04.164
FOUNDATION -- FOR FOR FOR PGA

01:50:04.230 --> 01:50:06.066
NEED TO MEET ALL STATE RUN

01:50:06.132 --> 01:50:07.934
RELEVANT STATE REQUIREMENTS

01:50:08.001 --> 01:50:09.536
INCLUDING THE OUR PS STANDARDS.

01:50:09.602 --> 01:50:12.872
AS WELL AS THAT IS -- THE PC

01:50:12.939 --> 01:50:14.140
CONSIDER THE RAPIER

01:50:14.207 --> 01:50:16.710
CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR A AND

01:50:16.776 --> 01:50:18.645
PROVIDES ADEQUATE -- ADJUSTMENTS

01:50:18.712 --> 01:50:19.813
INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:50:19.879 --> 01:50:22.816
VALUE SHARING SO THE THE THE THE

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:24.985
PLAN HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE

01:50:25.051 --> 01:50:27.053
COURT AND THEN THE PC WILL HAVE

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.822
TO CERTIFY THESE ELEMENTS IN ONE

01:50:28.888 --> 01:50:30.423
OF THE CERTIFICATION CRITERIA.

01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:32.692
IS THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THE

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:34.227
BANKRUPTCY BE RAPIER NEUTRAL

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:37.364
MEANING THAT THE PAYMENTS -- FOR

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:39.532
FOR VICTIMS THAT HAS TO BE DONE

01:50:39.599 --> 01:50:41.167
IN FULL IN A MANNER DETERMINED

01:50:41.234 --> 01:50:43.136
BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT HAS TO

01:50:43.203 --> 01:50:44.771
COME FROM SHAREHOLDERS OR OTHER

01:50:44.838 --> 01:50:46.072
ELEMENTS NOT FROM A REPAIR

01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:47.040
RECOVERY.

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:48.508
SO IF THEY DIDN'T MEET THOSE

01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:49.809
CONDITIONS IT WOULD FALL ON THE

01:50:49.876 --> 01:50:51.878
SHAREHOLDERS IF THEY DON'T MEET

01:50:51.945 --> 01:50:52.946
THOSE IF THEY DON'T MEET THOSE

01:50:53.013 --> 01:50:54.280
CONDITIONS THEY WILL NOT HAVE

01:50:54.347 --> 01:50:56.182
ACCESS TO THE FUND SO THEY THEY

01:50:56.249 --> 01:50:59.219
THE THIS CREATES BOTH.

01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:01.354
THE MAN THE CREATES THE PATH FOR

01:51:01.421 --> 01:51:02.956
THE RESOLUTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:04.591
IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR TO

01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:06.192
RATEPAYERS AND THAT IS FAIR TO

01:51:06.259 --> 01:51:07.494
VICTIMS AND IT BASICALLY

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.029
ESTABLISHES THE DEADLINE FOR

01:51:09.095 --> 01:51:09.496
THAT.

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:11.631
IT BASICALLY SAYS IF THEY WANT

01:51:11.698 --> 01:51:13.800
TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE TOOLS

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:14.567
THAT YOU'D BE PROVIDING IN THIS

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:15.468
MEASURE.

01:51:15.535 --> 01:51:17.203
THEY HAVE -- TO MEET THOSE

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:19.706
CRITERIA IF THEY DON'T THEN.

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:21.574
THEN THEY THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:51:21.641 --> 01:51:23.443
MECHANISM TO THE TOOLS THAT

01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:24.677
PROVIDE THE STABILITY TO ALLOW

01:51:24.744 --> 01:51:25.979
THE EXIT OUT OF BANKRUPTCY SO

01:51:26.046 --> 01:51:27.580
IT'S IT'S A BIG INCENTIVE FOR

01:51:27.647 --> 01:51:29.149
THEM TO GET THE BANKRUPTCY

01:51:29.215 --> 01:51:30.417
RESOLVE TO GET THE BANKRUPTCY

01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:32.218
RESOLVED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND

01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:32.886
TO DO IT IN A WAY.

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:37.724
WE'RE RATE PAYERS AND VICTIMS

01:51:37.791 --> 01:51:39.259
ARE PROTECTED.

01:51:39.325 --> 01:51:39.893
BUT MISTER IF I CAN JUST HAVE

01:51:39.959 --> 01:51:40.527
BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS

01:51:40.593 --> 01:51:41.828
IS THIS POINT IS CLEAR IS THAT

01:51:41.895 --> 01:51:42.996
ALSO IN REGARDS THE DEED OF YOUR

01:51:43.063 --> 01:51:44.230
CHARGE THE PORTION TO FIND THIS

01:51:44.297 --> 01:51:45.665
FROM RATE PAYERS DOESCOME FROM

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:47.067
THAT SEARCH CHARGES CAN EXTEND

01:51:47.133 --> 01:51:48.968
OUT THAT WAS GOING TO EXPIRE.

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:51.838
AND THAT DOES EXTEND OUT INTO

01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:53.073
TWENTY THIRTY SIX YEAH I

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:55.508
UNDERSTOOD THAT ONE THANKS

01:51:55.575 --> 01:51:55.809
[inaudible]

01:51:55.875 --> 01:51:58.044
THE ASPEN.

01:51:58.111 --> 01:51:59.212
THIS RAZA.

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:00.880
YES ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I

01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:03.850
BROUGHT UP -- SINCE EARLY ON IS

01:52:03.917 --> 01:52:05.418
HOW THE SAFETY CERTIFICATION

01:52:05.485 --> 01:52:08.021
WOULD WORK -- AND TO ME THAT'S

01:52:08.088 --> 01:52:09.089
NOT ONLY.

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:11.157
THAT OPENS THE DOOR RIGHT TO BE

01:52:11.224 --> 01:52:12.759
ABLE.

01:52:12.826 --> 01:52:15.261
TO GET THE GET ACCESS TO THE TO

01:52:15.328 --> 01:52:18.098
THE FUNDS -- IN A BIG WAY IF YOU

01:52:18.164 --> 01:52:21.401
HAVE A SAFETY CERTIFICATION THEN

01:52:21.468 --> 01:52:22.769
IT'S UP.

01:52:22.836 --> 01:52:25.872
TO WHOEVER. TO PROVE RUN THAT

01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:28.942
THEY IN FACT DID NOT YOU KNOW --

01:52:29.008 --> 01:52:32.479
ACT IN A IN A PRUDENT WAY SO MY

01:52:32.545 --> 01:52:36.316
CONCERN IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

01:52:36.382 --> 01:52:37.250
THAT WHO.

01:52:37.317 --> 01:52:40.086
IS MAKING THAT DECISION.

01:52:40.153 --> 01:52:43.356
HAS TO BE AS INDEPENDENT

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:43.656
[inaudible]

01:52:43.723 --> 01:52:45.625
AS POSSIBLE.

01:52:45.692 --> 01:52:49.262
AND WHAT IS MADE THE THRESHOLD

01:52:49.329 --> 01:52:50.096
TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT SAFETY

01:52:50.163 --> 01:52:52.999
CERTIFICATION IS ALSO A VERY

01:52:53.066 --> 01:52:54.834
CRITICAL DECISION.

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:57.103
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT NOT

01:52:57.170 --> 01:52:59.672
ONLY SO THAT THIS DOESN'T BECOME.

01:52:59.739 --> 01:53:01.407
YOU KNOW I'M EASY LOOPHOLE --

01:53:01.474 --> 01:53:03.276
END OF MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THE

01:53:03.343 --> 01:53:05.645
TRUST OF THE PUBLIC IS THAT

01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:06.946
THESE ARE.

01:53:07.013 --> 01:53:09.716
THESE ARE YOU KNOW ONE WAY OR

01:53:09.782 --> 01:53:10.683
ANOTHER THESE ARE.

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:12.485
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF OF THE

01:53:12.552 --> 01:53:14.420
TRUST OF THE PUBLIC'S MONEY.

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:16.789
SO HOW DO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

01:53:16.856 --> 01:53:19.492
AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT

01:53:19.559 --> 01:53:21.361
THAT PIECE OF IT.

01:53:21.427 --> 01:53:23.730
IS REALLY A SOLID AND AS STRONG

01:53:23.796 --> 01:53:27.567
AS IT NEEDS TO BE.

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:29.569
BUT A COUPLE OF ELEMENTS -- THAT

01:53:29.636 --> 01:53:31.738
AT FIRST THERE'S A NEW -- A NEW

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:34.607
DIVISION FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON

01:53:34.674 --> 01:53:37.877
ON ON ON THE ELECTRICITY --

01:53:37.944 --> 01:53:41.214
SAFETY IT STARTS WITH IN THE PC

01:53:41.281 --> 01:53:41.447
BUT IT.

01:53:41.514 --> 01:53:43.683
IT'S BECOMES AN INDEPENDENT

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:46.452
ENTITY WITHIN THE RESOURCES

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:48.054
AGENCY THAT IS EXCLUSIVELY

01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:49.923
FOCUSED ON THIS.

01:53:49.989 --> 01:53:52.125
ON THIS ISSUE -- WITHIN TWO

01:53:52.192 --> 01:53:54.227
YEARS SECOND PIECE IS THERE BE A

01:53:54.294 --> 01:53:55.995
NEW ADVISORY BOARD OF THAT WOULD

01:53:56.062 --> 01:53:58.531
BE -- COMPRISED OF APPOINTEES BY

01:53:58.598 --> 01:54:00.900
THE GOVERNOR THE THE ASSEMBLY

01:54:00.967 --> 01:54:03.703
AND THE SENATE THAT WILL BE.

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:04.737
COMPRISED OF NATIONAL

01:54:04.804 --> 01:54:07.440
INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS ON ISSUES

01:54:07.507 --> 01:54:11.611
OF SAFETY AND ISSUES OF OF YOU

01:54:11.678 --> 01:54:13.112
KNOW UTILITY UTILITY.

01:54:13.179 --> 01:54:17.016
UTILITY SAFETY AND THE THIS IS A

01:54:17.083 --> 01:54:19.519
RAPIDLY EMERGING FIELD SO THAT'S

01:54:19.586 --> 01:54:20.486
PART OF WHY IT'S REALLY

01:54:20.553 --> 01:54:21.654
IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ENTITY

01:54:21.721 --> 01:54:22.589
THAT'S GOING TO BE EXCLUSIVELY

01:54:22.655 --> 01:54:24.257
FOCUSED ON THIS AS WELL AS

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:26.125
BENEFIT FROM THE EXPERTISE OF

01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:27.827
NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS.

01:54:27.894 --> 01:54:29.395
THERE WILL BE AN ANNUAL WHILE

01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:30.964
FAR MITIGATION PLAN THERE WILL

01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:33.766
BE PROGRESS REPORTS THERE WILL

01:54:33.833 --> 01:54:36.202
BE A LOOK BACK -- MECHANISM AND

01:54:36.269 --> 01:54:37.103
THIS WILL BE AN ANNUAL

01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:38.905
CERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT WILL

01:54:38.972 --> 01:54:40.473
BE DONE BY THE NEW ENTITY THERE

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.809
ALSO WILL BE FIELD A LOT IT'S AN

01:54:42.875 --> 01:54:44.210
ACTUAL VERIFICATION ON THE

01:54:44.277 --> 01:54:45.812
GROUND OF WHETHER FOLKS ARE

01:54:45.878 --> 01:54:47.046
DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:54:47.113 --> 01:54:47.313
BE DOING.

01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:49.682
AND IT'S KIND OF A THE THE FIRST

01:54:49.749 --> 01:54:51.484
YEAR IS GOING TO BE -- IT'S THE

01:54:51.551 --> 01:54:53.253
FIRST YEAR THE PROCESS IS NOT AS

01:54:53.319 --> 01:54:54.487
RIGOROUS AS IT IS INFUTURE

01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:56.155
YEARS JUST BASED ON A REALITY OF

01:54:56.222 --> 01:54:57.190
WHERE WE ARE.

01:54:57.257 --> 01:54:58.024
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:54:58.091 --> 01:55:00.126
MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO ENSURE

01:55:00.193 --> 01:55:02.395
THAT NOT ONLY ARE THERE ROBUST

01:55:02.462 --> 01:55:03.463
PLANS FOR THE THOSE PLANS ARE

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:04.631
BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT THERE ARE

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:06.499
PROGRESS REPORTS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:07.300
THAT AND THAT THERE'S ON THE

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:07.934
GROUND.

01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:10.370
EXAMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT

01:55:10.436 --> 01:55:13.473
THINGS ARE BEING DONE AS THEIR

01:55:13.539 --> 01:55:15.642
WAS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.

01:55:15.708 --> 01:55:16.876
I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THAT

01:55:16.943 --> 01:55:18.978
THE LEGISLATURE STILL HAS

01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:20.880
OPPORTUNITY DO OVERSIGHT OF THIS

01:55:20.947 --> 01:55:22.181
PROCESS THERE WILL BE REPORTS

01:55:22.248 --> 01:55:22.982
THAT WILL COME BACK TO THE

01:55:23.049 --> 01:55:24.817
LEGISLATURE THAT WILL HIGHLIGHT

01:55:24.884 --> 01:55:26.119
AND DELINEATE WHAT KIND OF

01:55:26.185 --> 01:55:27.353
PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TO WHAT

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:28.655
IS HAPPENING AND THEN WE HAVE AN

01:55:28.721 --> 01:55:31.758
OPPORTUNITY. TO CALL AND THE

01:55:31.824 --> 01:55:32.525
FOLKS THAT WE NEED TO AND MAKE

01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:33.459
SURE THAT.

01:55:33.526 --> 01:55:35.595
WERE SATISFIED WITH THE KIND OF

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:38.264
PROGRESS IS BEING MADE.

01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:40.333
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.434

THANK YOU MISTER CHARGE WANT TO

01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:52.245
GO BACK A REAL QUICK AND FOLLOW

01:55:52.312 --> 01:55:53.880
UP ON THE RAY FAIR QUESTION --

01:55:53.946 --> 01:55:55.315
IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:55:55.381 --> 01:55:56.983
SURCHARGE ON UTILITY CUSTOMERS

01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:58.184
WOULD BE ASSESSED BASED ON A

01:55:58.251 --> 01:56:00.820
KILOWATT -- PROPER USAGE.

01:56:00.887 --> 01:56:02.622
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'S

01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:04.590
GONNA BE DISPARITY IN RATE

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:07.960
PAYERS AND SPECIFICALLY BETWEEN

01:56:08.027 --> 01:56:09.295
STORE CUSTOMERS AND NON SOBRE

01:56:09.362 --> 01:56:10.396
CUSTOMERS.

01:56:10.463 --> 01:56:13.166
RECOGNIZING THAT STILL THERE'S A

01:56:13.232 --> 01:56:16.135
MINORITY OF ELECTRICAL CUSTOMERS

01:56:16.202 --> 01:56:20.106
HAVE SOLAR -- BUT THE MAJORITY

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:21.174
IS ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:23.343
IT SO ORG OR DON'T WANT TO

01:56:23.409 --> 01:56:24.243
CHOOSE TO HAVE SOLAR SO HOW DOES

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:25.078
THAT.

01:56:25.144 --> 01:56:26.479
OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THERE

01:56:26.546 --> 01:56:27.380
THERE COULD BE A DISPARITY ON

01:56:27.447 --> 01:56:28.514
THAT.

01:56:28.581 --> 01:56:30.983
YES THERE IS -- I MEAN I ONE OF

01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:31.551
THEM.

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:32.785
WE WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS IN

01:56:32.852 --> 01:56:34.387
FACT EARLY ON WE WERE WE ARE

01:56:34.454 --> 01:56:35.822
QUESTIONING WHETHER THE DICKS

01:56:35.888 --> 01:56:37.590

ME TALKING I'M IS THAT IT WAS A

01:56:42.762 --> 01:56:44.630
PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE -- BACK

01:56:44.697 --> 01:56:46.499
IN JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH I HAD

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:47.867
SEVERAL PEOPLE COMING INTO MY

01:56:47.934 --> 01:56:49.669

01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:54.006
WHEN I HAD THROWN OUT THIS IDEA

01:56:54.073 --> 01:56:55.541
OF DOING A PER METER CHARGE AND

01:56:55.608 --> 01:56:57.477

THAT FOR FOR FOR FOLKS THAT LIVE

01:56:59.312 --> 01:57:01.848

TO US NOT ONE IDEA -- CAME BACK

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.688
THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE WAS

01:57:08.755 --> 01:57:10.990
EXTENDED AS THE W. ARE DEDUCTED

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:12.091

THAT'S THE THAT'S A FACT -- BUT

01:57:27.273 --> 01:57:28.941
IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT --

01:57:29.008 --> 01:57:31.077
I IT MAKES THE MOST SENSE AND IT

01:57:31.144 --> 01:57:32.412
IS THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE

01:57:32.478 --> 01:57:37.683
WILL BE ARGUING ABOUT THAT -- IT

01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:38.651
FOR THE NEXT.

01:57:38.718 --> 01:57:39.685
YEAR TWO YEARS TO TRY TO COME UP

01:57:39.752 --> 01:57:40.319
WITH SOMETHING AND THAT WAS THE

01:57:40.386 --> 01:57:41.988

UPS ON THIS WHOLE CONCEPT IS THE

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:53.733
NEEDED WE ARE CHARGING.

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:57.170
I THINK FOR ME IT'S IT'S SMARTER --

01:57:57.236 --> 01:57:58.404
HE YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A VERY

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:01.107
CYNICAL AREA OF THE STATE WHEN

01:58:01.174 --> 01:58:02.642
IT COMES TO TRUSTING GOVERNMENT

01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:04.177
AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A CHARGE IT

01:58:04.243 --> 01:58:05.511
IS.

01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:06.779
SCHEDULED TO GO AWAY AT A

01:58:06.846 --> 01:58:09.115
CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND MY

01:58:09.182 --> 01:58:10.316
CONSTITUENTS KNOW THAT.

01:58:10.383 --> 01:58:13.119
AND AT TO COME BACK TO THEM IN

01:58:13.186 --> 01:58:14.353
STATES BEING EXTENDED FOR

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:15.421
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T EVEN

01:58:15.488 --> 01:58:18.057
ORIGINALLY PUT IN PLACE -- FOR

01:58:18.124 --> 01:58:19.759
IS KIND OF MAKES IT TOUGH.

01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:21.060
AND AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT

01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:22.061
BECAUSE SOME OF YOUR

01:58:22.128 --> 01:58:23.396
CONSTITUENTS THINK ABOUT LIKE

01:58:23.463 --> 01:58:26.799
SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS -- AND

01:58:26.866 --> 01:58:29.802

01:58:29.869 --> 01:58:32.138
IF IT'S NOT THIS THAN THAN WHAT

01:58:32.205 --> 01:58:32.572

PAYING MORE.

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:42.081

REPAIRS ARE GONNA BE PAYING MORE

01:58:45.518 --> 01:58:47.520

YES WE WERE WORKING ON

02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:22.582
REGIONALIZATION BUT THIS BECAME

02:00:22.648 --> 02:00:23.749
MORE IMPORTANT THAN

02:00:23.816 --> 02:00:25.551
REGIONALIZATION IF YOU WILL --

02:00:25.618 --> 02:00:29.055

ELOQUENTLY.

02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:44.971
OUTLINED A PROSPECTIVE SOLUTION --

02:00:45.037 --> 02:00:47.406
TO INVOLVE THE SHAREHOLDERS IN

02:00:47.473 --> 02:00:49.041
THIS PROCESS.

02:00:49.108 --> 02:00:50.443
WHERE THEIR SKIN IN THE GAME?

02:00:50.509 --> 02:00:53.112
AND THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:00:53.179 --> 02:00:54.447
FOR PREDICTABILITY FOR THE RATE

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:56.782
PAYERS AND ALSO HAVE A MECHANISM

02:00:56.849 --> 02:00:58.918
IN PLACE THAT VICTIMS ARE TAKING

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:01.087
CARE OF QUICKLY.

02:01:01.153 --> 02:01:02.755
AND THAT THEY'RE NOT A DRAG

02:01:02.822 --> 02:01:04.323
THROUGH COURTS AND PUT AT THE

02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:05.992
BACK OF THE LINE AS THEY ARE

02:01:06.058 --> 02:01:09.695
CURRENTLY -- AND SO WITH THAT I

02:01:09.762 --> 02:01:11.230
