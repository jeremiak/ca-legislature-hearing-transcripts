EVOLUTION THAN WE DID FOURTEEN

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:50.543
AND SEES BECAUSE OF HOW THE

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.859
HAVE TO GO FORTY EIGHT PLUS

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.561
MONTHS AFTER THESE SERVICES

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.096
LAUNCH THE TNC SERVICES LUNCH

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:18.597
TO HAVE THE FIRST REVIEWED

00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:21.267
PAPER- THAT WAS INDEPENDENT.

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:24.970
AND THEN ANALYTICAL- AND THAT

00:13:25.037 --> 00:13:27.673
WAS BASED ON- THE WORK OF AN

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.941
EARLY BRAZIL AND DAVID KIRK AND

00:13:29.008 --> 00:13:30.709
IT BASICALLY LOOKED AT. NOT

00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:32.411
OVER DATA NOT LIFTED UP BUTTON

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.446
IT SAID TRAFFIC FATALITY DATA

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:35.514
AND LOOKED AT THE INTRODUCTION

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:37.583
OF UBER INTO A MARKET PLACE.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.118
AND SEE IF THAT AFFECTED

00:13:39.185 --> 00:13:40.986
TRAFFIC FATALITIES AT ALL AND

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:42.288
THEY FOUND IT DIDN'T SO FOUR

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:44.990
YEARS AFTER. THAT STUDY WAS THE

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:46.425
FIRST FOUR YEARS AFTER THE

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.927
LAUNCH WAS THE FIRST REVIEWED

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.695
STUDY. FURTHER MORE AT THE

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:51.897
FIRST- CITY STUDY OR CITY

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:53.465
COUNTY STUDY IN THIS CASE WAS

00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:55.334
BY THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:56.936
TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY TO TRY

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:58.504
TO MAKE SENSE OF. THESE

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:00.506
VEHICLES IN THEIR DISTRICT AND

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:01.140
THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AFTER THEIR

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:04.076
LAUNCH- SO IN CONTRAST WE KNOW

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:07.046
A LOT TWENTY SIX MONTHS AFTER.

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:07.780
THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE

00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:13.552
DEVICES INTO- THE. CITY OF

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:14.019
SANTA MONICA AND OTHER

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:17.723
LOCATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. ONE OF

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.324
THE THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT HIS

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.425
INJURIES- SO THERE HAVE BEEN

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:19.925
THREE MAJOR STUDIES OF

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:20.726
INJURIES- THAT HAVE BEEN

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:21.393
RELEASED IN THE PAST YEAR. WHEN

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.230
IT UCLA- ONE IN PORTLAND AND

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:25.864
ANOTHER IN AUSTIN AND ALL OF

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:27.633
THE STUDIES USED ITS DATA

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.401
COLLECTED IN EMERGENCY ROOMS TO

00:14:29.468 --> 00:14:30.803
DESCRIBE INJURIES TO SCOOTER

00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:32.805
USERS. BY THE MOST COMMON

00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:33.839
INJURIES WERE TO THE UPPER

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:36.275
EXTREMITIES SO THE LIMBS- ARMS

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:39.378
BROKEN ARMS.ABOUT 15% OF

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:41.981
INJURIES. THAT WERE REPORTED

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:43.382
RESULTED IN A TRAUMATIC BRAIN

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:44.883
INJURY. THAT'S PARTIALLY

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.685
BECAUSE HELMET USE WAS REPORTED

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:48.854
TO BE UNDER 10% FOR THE INJURED

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:52.358
PARTIES. 8290% OF INCIDENTS

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:53.392
DEPENDING ON THE STUDY AREA

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.294
WERE SINGLE PARTY INCIDENTS

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:55.861
MEANING THEY DIDN'T INVOLVE

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:59.965
ANOTHER PERSON OR VEHICLE. SOME

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:01.400
USERS IN THOSE STUDIES WERE

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:04.303
INTOXICATED- 5% IN LA 16%

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.705
IMPORTANT PORTLAND AUSTIN

00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:07.706
ACTUALLY FOLLOWED UP WITH

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:08.807
PEOPLE WHO HAD CRASHED AND

00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:11.243
REPORTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOMS

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.945
AND FOUND THAT 50% OF INJURED

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:14.546
PARTIES BELIEVE THAT ROADWAY

00:15:14.613 --> 00:15:17.116
CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:17.750
CRASH OR THE SEVERITY OF THEIR

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:20.819
INJURIES AND- FOUND THAT THIRTY

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:23.289
PER 3% OF THOSE WHO WERE

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:23.856
INJURED WERE INJURED DRING

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:26.792
THEIR FIRST RIDE- AND 63% OF

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:29.728
THOSE REPORTING INJURIES- HAD

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.530
WRITTEN FEWER THAN NINE TIME

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:32.731
SUGGESTING THAT RATES COULD GO

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.533
DOWN OVER TIME. SO WHAT ARE

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.968
THOSE RATES AND HOW DO THEY

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:36.769
COMPARE WITH OTHER MODES OF

00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:39.038
TRANSPORTATION- THE AUSTIN IN

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:40.873
PORTLAND STUDIES ESTIMATE RATES

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:43.575
INJURIES OF TWENTY TO TWENTY

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:45.377
FIVE INJURIES THAT REPORT TO AN

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:47.212
EMERGENCY ROOM PER HUNDRED

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.781
THOUSAND TRIPS- THE AUSTIN

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:50.582
STUDY NOTED THAT THIS WASN'T A

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:51.917
CAUSE FOR ALARM ALTHOUGH IT'S

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:53.652
HARD TO COMPARE THIS WITH OTHER

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:55.087
MODES OF TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:56.355
WE JUST HAVE DATA ON INJURIES

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:57.389
WERE SOMEBODY REPORTED TO AN

00:15:57.456 --> 00:16:01.794
EMERGENCY ROOM SO AS MORE

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.428
STUDY. HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE WE

00:16:02.494 --> 00:16:05.664
EXPECT MARK. INFORMATION ON

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:06.598
THAT SAN FRANCISCO REPORTED

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:08.701
SIXTEEN COLLISIONS PER HUNDRED

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:09.535
THOUSAND A SKIP TRIPS. SO IN

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:11.437
GENERAL TO SIR MY- SUMMARIZE

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:12.938
THE INJURY DATA IT WOULD SEEM

00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:14.907
THAT THERE'S- POTENTIALLY

00:16:14.973 --> 00:16:16.775
HIGHER RISK AT NIGHT AND HIGHER

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:18.043
RISK WHEN IF SOMEBODY'S FIRST

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.547
FEW TIMES ON A SCOOTER- LOOK AT

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:23.882
UNC AND- UNVERIFIED BUT

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:25.551
INDEPENDENTLY COLLECTED DATA BY

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:26.985
AN INDUSTRY ANALYSTS. SUGGEST

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:31.390
THAT- ABOUT- TWENTY SIX OF

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:31.924
FORTY FOR COUNTIES TRACKED

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.626
OCCURRED AT NIGHT. SO WHAT DO

00:16:34.693 --> 00:16:35.227
WE KNOW ABOUT SHARED MOBILITY

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:37.062
DEVICES AND TRAVEL BEHAVIOR. A

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:38.130
LOT OF WHAT WE KNOW COMES FROM

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:39.865
THE CITY SURVEYS THAT ARE

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:41.166
LAUNCHED AS A CONDITION OF THE

00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:43.035
PERMITTING PROCESS. SO IN SAN

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:45.471
FRANCISCO 70% OF TRIPS WERE

00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:48.574
UNDER TWO MILES. OF 41% OF

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.109
SCOOTER USERS OR MOBILITY

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:51.610
DEVICE USERS WOULD HAVE USED

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:54.646
CAR FOR THEIR MOST RECENT TRIP.

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:56.582
31% WOULD OF WALKED 11% WOULD

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.450
HAVE USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.753
AND 34% ACTUALLY USE THE DEVICE

00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:02.855
TO GET TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:05.724
MUNIR PART. IN THIS CASE- SAN

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:07.593
FRANCISCO SANTA MONICA FOUND

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:09.228
HIGHER RATES OF DIVERSION FROM

00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:11.764
CARS ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT- BUT

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.899
ALSO ONLY THAT 4% OF USERS

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:16.034
SURVEYED WERE GOING TO AND FROM

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:17.236
TRANSIT SO THE RESULTS FOR THE

00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:19.638
LAST MILE. THAT MIGHT VARY

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.039
BASED ON LOCAL CONTEXT-

00:17:21.106 --> 00:17:22.708
PORTLAND SOUND FOUND SIMILAR

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:26.111
FIGURES ONLY 6% USING THE-

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:29.281
DEVICES TO GET TO FROM TRANSIT.

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:30.382
SO IT SEEMS THAT THE AUTO TRIPS

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:31.083
THAT THESE SERVICES ARE

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.085
PRIMARILY DISPLACING ARE THEY

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:35.220
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANY-

00:17:35.287 --> 00:17:36.688
TYPE TRIPS AND THAT WAS THE

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:38.624
CASE IN SAN FRANCISCO SANTA

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.393
MONICA. AND PORTLAND. THE END

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.395
THAT DIVERSION FROM CAR TRIPS

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:44.463
IS IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVING

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.632
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:47.666
REDUCTIONS SO THERE WAS A PEER

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.768
REVIEWED STUDY EARLIER THIS

00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:51.503
YEAR THAT LOOKED AT- THE

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.472
GREENHOUSE GASES FROM THE

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:54.306
MANUFACTURE OF THESE FACES

00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:56.775
TRANSPORTATION ACROSS THE-

00:17:56.842 --> 00:17:58.577
PACIFIC- DEPLOYMENT MAINTENANCE

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:01.180
ETCETERA. AND FOUND THAT A LOT

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.215
OF PEOPLE JUST FOCUS ON THE-

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:05.417
THE MILE TRAVELED YOU KNOW THE

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:06.852
ZERO EMISSION MILE TRAVELED BUT

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.353
ACTUALLY CLOSE 290% OF THE

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.355
EMISSIONS. WERE ASSOCIATED WITH

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:11.924
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.825
DEVICES AND THE RELATIVELY

00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:15.928
SHORT LIFESPAN. AND THE

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:17.362
REBALANCING ACTIVITY THAT TAKES

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:20.199
PLACE- WITH THESE DEVICES AND

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:21.934
SO THE EMISSIONS FROM RE

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.936
BALANCING CAN DEFERRED PENDING

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:26.638
ON THE OPERATING MODEL EMPLOYED

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:28.207
SOME EMPLOYEE A GIG BASS

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:30.275
PIECEMEAL MODEL IN SUMMER MORE

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:31.777
CENTRALIZED AND MORE EFFICIENT

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:34.780
IN TERMS OF THE MODEL THAT THE

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:35.280
COMPANY USES TO COLLECT

00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:39.184
SCOOTERS. THE RESEARCHERS AT

00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:39.785
SAN JOSE SOME- STATES MINETA

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:41.553
INSTITUTE DID A STUDY AND FOUND

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.922
THAT 90% OF SCOOTER SAMPLED IN

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:44.957
SAN JOSE. DIDN'T DISRUPT

00:18:45.023 --> 00:18:46.892
PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC COURSE THAT

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:50.562
MEANS THAT 10% DID. SO WHAT ARE

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:52.364
OTHER STATES DOING WELL

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:52.998
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:53.599
CONFERENCE OF STATE

00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:55.767
LEGISLATURES BUT TWENTY TWO

00:18:55.834 --> 00:18:57.169
STATES HAVE ENACTED STATUTES

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:58.770
ADDRESSING SHARED MOBILITY

00:18:58.837 --> 00:18:59.805
DEVICE BUSINESS MODELS FOR

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:03.075
DEVICE TYPES. CALIFORNIA

00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:04.076
INCLUDED LAST YEAR FLORES AB

00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:05.944
TWENTY NINE EIGHTY NINE. SO

00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:07.179
WHAT THIS LEGISLATION IS DOING

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:08.780
AS PRIMARILY SETTING INSURANCE

00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:10.916

BICYCLE LANE WHEN PRESIDENT

00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:17.189
YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS.

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.657
CALIFORNIA AND OREGON ARE THE

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:21.126
ONLY TWO STATES THAT RECALL-

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:21.760
PROHIBIT THESE USERS FROM USING

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:24.663
THE SIDEWALK. SETTING DEVICE

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:25.964
REQUIREMENTS SOME OF THIS

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:26.999
LEGISLATION SETS MAXIMUM

SPECIFICATION FOR THE SAFETY

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:33.805
FEATURES. CALIFORNIA IS ALSO

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:35.507
THE ONLY STATE TO REQUIRE A

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:36.041
DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR THEIR

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:39.311
OPERATION. SOME OF THESE BILLS

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:41.713
ESTABLISH AUTHORITY FOR LOCALS

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.181
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ASSESS

00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:45.217
FINES AND PENALTIES ON SHARED

MOBILITY DEVICE CENTER

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:50.055
OPERATORS. SEVEN OF THE TWENTY

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:51.023
TWO STATES EXPRESSLY ALLOW

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:53.125
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROHIBIT

00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:54.593
THE OPERATIONS OF THESE AND

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.563
FIVE OF THE TWENTY TWO. STRICT

00:19:57.629 --> 00:19:59.798
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM APPLYING

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:03.268
ANY MORE RESTRICTIVE-

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:03.869
REGULATION ON THE IS THAT HOW

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:06.572
THEY WOULD REGULATE BICYCLES.

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:08.907
SOME OF THIS LEGISLATION DOES

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:10.175
DEAL WITH THE SHARING OF DATA

00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:12.311
WITH LOCAL REGULATORS THREE

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:13.412
STATES AUTHORIZED LOCAL

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:15.314
GOVERNMENTS TO REQUIRE SCOOTER

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.982
DATA SHARING INCLUDING RIGHT

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.951
ACTIVITY DATA THAT'S- IS ON A

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:21.286
NEVADA AND UTAH. AND THESE LAWS

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:22.788
OFTEN SET PARAMETERS FOR HOW

00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:24.323
THE LOCAL AUTHORITY USES THE

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.525

PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.465
INFORMATION. IT DOESN'T APPEAR

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:35.834
THAT ANY STATE PROHIBITS LOCAL

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:36.368
GOVERNMENTS FROM REQUIRING

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:39.605
ABILITY DATA SHARING. SO WHAT'S

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:41.707
HAPPENING IN THE CITY SO- THIS

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:42.808
IS BEEN A BIT OF A STUDY IN

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:45.377
CONTRASTS- BECAUSE OF TNC IS

00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:47.679
WITH THE STATE PREEMPTION-

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.247
THERE WAS A UNIFORM STATEWIDE

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:52.084
APPROACH TO TNC INTEGRATION-

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.586
WITH SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES

00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:56.622
IT'S A REALLY A CASE OF- AND

00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:58.357

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:03.328
MODELS. SO AS EVIDENCE OF THESE

00:21:03.395 --> 00:21:05.764
CONTRAST SOME CALIFORNIA CITIES

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.399
PROHIBITS YOUR MOBILITY DEVICES

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.534

TO ASSIST IN PROGRAM EVALUATION.

00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:30.716
THE DIVERSITY OF THESE

00:22:30.782 --> 00:22:32.184
PERMITTING PROGRAMS CAN HELP

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.187
IDENTIFY REGULATORY MODELS THAT

ABOUT THIS INVOLVING BUSINESS

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:50.001
MODEL BUT THE DOWNSIDE OF THIS

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:51.670
ENVIRONMENT APPROACH AND

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:53.305
REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY HAS BEEN

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:55.574
A PATCHWORK THEY CAN BE

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.943
CONFUSING TO USERS IN THE

TIME. DISCUSSING THE RELEASE OF

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:15.360
POSITION DATA. I JUST DON'T

00:23:15.427 --> 00:23:19.364
KNOW WHY WOULD A MUNICIPALITY

00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:19.931
WANT THAT DATA WHAT KIND OF

00:23:19.998 --> 00:23:20.565
DEEP DIVING ARE THEY DOING WITH

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:22.534
IT. SO THERE IS THE POSITION OF

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:24.503
A VEHICLE AVAILABLE FOR RENT

00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:26.471
AND SO THOSE ARE OFTEN RELEASED

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:28.673
PUBLICLY BY THE PROVIDER SO IT

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.908
SAYS THERE IS A DEVICE RIGHT

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:31.443

TRIP POSITION DATA- IS CAN BE

00:23:40.051 --> 00:23:41.953
USED FOR A VARIETY OF MEANS SO

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.189
SOME OF IT IS TRUST BUT VERIFY.

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:46.158
TO MAKE SURE IF YOU DO HAVE A

00:23:46.224 --> 00:23:46.858
CAP ON THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:49.728
DEVICES IN YOUR CITY- THAT THE

00:23:49.795 --> 00:23:52.030
FULL SUITE OF THE DATA REFLECTS

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:54.733
THAT THE- OPERATOR IS- IT

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.234
HEARING TO THAT CAP I SOME OF

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:57.769
THAT IS LOOKING AT THE NUMBER

00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:59.004
OF TRIPS THROUGHOUT THE CITY

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.572
WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE

00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:02.073
SURE THAT IT SEEMS. LIKE HONEST

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.109
DATA OTHERS JUST ASSISTING

00:24:04.176 --> 00:24:06.044
TRANSPORTATION PLANNING-

00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:08.313
THINKING ABOUT OF SAFETY FOR

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.048
ALL ROAD USERS BY CLEANS IT

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:11.283
CETERA UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE

00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:12.684
BIT BETTER- INSTEAD OF DOING

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:14.719
MANUAL COUNTS WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:15.954
USING BIKES OTHER TYPES OF

00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:18.590
DEVICES SO THIS IS A- KIND OF A

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:19.558
BIG DATA APPROACH TO ASSIST

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:21.493
WITH SOME OF THE OTHER. AREAS

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.629
OF TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:28.967
SAFETY FOR ROAD USERS. WOULD

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:33.438
THAT BE. OBVIOUS IMAGES TO OVER

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:34.005
ON YOUR TOWN YOU'D SEE WHAT

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:34.573
KIND OF ACTIVITIES GOING ON

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:37.809
WITH THE SCOOTERS. IT IT CAN BE

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:38.310
BUT THAT TO DO THAT IN A

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:39.778
SCIENTIFIC WAY- REQUIRE CERTAIN

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:42.814
PROCEDURES OFTEN HIRING.

00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:43.448
AFRICAN JIM HEARING FROM DOING

00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:44.449
A SCREEN LINE COUNT FOR A

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:45.517
PERIOD OF AN HOUR JUST TO MAKE

00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:47.252
SURE THAT IT'S NOT MANIC TOTAL

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.887
TREND THAT'S BEING OBSERVED AND

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:49.988
THEN YOU MISS WHATEVER COUNTY

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:51.656
YOU HAVE THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF.

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:52.691
THE AREA THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:24:52.757 --> 00:24:55.060
SO THIS TYPE OF DATA AND THIS

00:24:55.126 --> 00:24:55.594
ISN'T THE ONLY THING THAT

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.896
THEY'RE USING IT FOR- CAN BE

00:24:57.963 --> 00:25:01.066
QUITE HELPFUL IN IN. VALIDATING

00:25:01.132 --> 00:25:02.767
WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS

00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:04.369
JUSTIFICATION FOR INVESTMENT IN

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:08.273
A BIKE LANE- LOOKING IF THE

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.976
BIKE LANE IS POTENTIALLY. PLAN

00:25:11.042 --> 00:25:12.611
TO BE IN THE RIGHT AREA OR A

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:14.846
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING OTHER

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:17.282
TYPES OF CUT THREE TRIPS- SO.

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:17.816
THEN I GET A AND ONE OTHER

00:25:17.883 --> 00:25:21.353
QUESTION WOULD BE. AS HAS ANY

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:22.287
MUNICIPALITY FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:26.591
FOR. FIND A FAIR SERVICE FEE OR

00:25:26.658 --> 00:25:28.727
USE IT AS A REVENUE SOURCE JUST

00:25:28.793 --> 00:25:29.261
LIKE THEY WOULD WITH TAXI

00:25:29.327 --> 00:25:30.528
COMPANIES AND OTHER. RENTAL

00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:36.268
ACTIVITIES. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY

00:25:36.334 --> 00:25:38.169
ANY COMPANY OR ANY CITY HAS

00:25:38.236 --> 00:25:39.404
FOUND SOMETHING THAT THE

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:42.274
PROVIDERS ARE HAPPY WITH- I

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:42.874
THINK IT'S YOU KNOW INVOLVING

00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:44.910
MODEL SO THERE MIGHT BE SUBJECT

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:47.245
TO NEGOTIATION AND EVERY

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:48.580
MARKETS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:51.182
AND SO CITIES HAVE DIFFERENT

00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:54.085
PROPENSITIES TO HAVE PEOPLE

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:55.086
USING THESE DEVICES PEOPLE IN

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:57.289
CITIES HAVE DIFFERENT ABILITIES

00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:59.624
AND WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR THE

00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:03.161
STOCK TYPE DEVICES SO THE. FEE

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:05.196
MAY DIFFER AND PIANIST

00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:07.365
DIFFERENT THIS- RIALTO IS FROM-

00:26:07.432 --> 00:26:10.435
SANTA MONICA. THANK YOU THANK

00:26:10.502 --> 00:26:10.869

ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. WHEN

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:15.173
ASKING QUESTIONS YOU MAY NOT BE

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.409
ABLE TO ANSWER HI I KNOW THIS

00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:18.043
ISN'T YOUR DATA IT'S THE THAT

00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:20.312
YOU'RE YOU'VE COMPILED. SO YOU

00:26:20.378 --> 00:26:22.113
MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE OTHER

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.849
STATES THAT ALLOW A SCOOTERS TO

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:26.851
BE ON SIDEWALKS THAT WERE ONE

00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:28.253
OF A FEW THAT PROHIBITS THAT

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.121
STATEWIDE. IS THERE ANY

00:26:30.188 --> 00:26:32.190
COMPARISON IN THE INJURY DATA

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:34.926
FROM OUR SCOOTERS THAT ARE

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:36.962
FORCED INTO THE STREET VERSUS

00:26:37.028 --> 00:26:38.029
STATES THAT ALLOW SCOOTERS ON

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:39.831
SIDEWALKS. IS THERE ANY

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:41.366
COMPARISON AT ALL TO SEE IF

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.101
THAT REDUCES CERTAIN TYPES OF

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:45.470
INJURIES I AM I'M NOT AWARE OF

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:46.738
AN ANALYSIS THAT THAN THAT IS

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:48.273
DONE EXACTLY THAT AND THEN DID

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.908
YOU ALSO HAVE IT I'M SORRY IF I

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:51.443
MISLED YOU HAVE STATISTIC ABOUT

IN DIFFERENT CITIES AS WELL AS

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.412
DIFFERENT STATES IT DO YOU HAVE

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:30.248
AN OPINION AS TO THE PROS AND

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:33.618
CONS OF ALLOWING- LOCAL

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:35.453
JURISDICTIONS TO ADOPT THEIR

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.757
OWN- PUBLIC SAFETY RULES VERSUS

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:40.892
HAVING US A MINIMUM. STATEWIDE

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:46.364
STANDARDS. DO I HAVE OPINIONS-

00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:47.565
IF YOU DID IT IT SEEMS LIKE

00:27:47.632 --> 00:27:50.135
THERE WOULD BE A MIX RIGHT WE

00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:51.936
DON'T ALLOW THAT FOR. OF

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:53.905
VEHICLES WE HAVE A UNIFORM CODE

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:56.941
OF VEHICLES SIGNALS- RULES OF

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:58.143
THE ROAD STATEWIDE AND THEN

00:27:58.209 --> 00:28:00.545
ALLOW LOCALS TO USE CERTAIN

00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:02.280
TOOLS IN THE TOOL KIT TO SAY

00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:03.481
OKAY YOU CAN'T GO HERE YOU

00:28:03.548 --> 00:28:05.650
CAN'T PARK HERE. AND SO IT

00:28:05.717 --> 00:28:07.886
COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:28:07.952 --> 00:28:09.521
THAT IS THE RIGHT BALANCE WE

00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:11.756
HAVE A- LOT OF DIFFERENT.

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:14.059
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE STATE SO

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:15.393
IT'S HARD TO THINK OF ONE

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.263
UNIFORM STATEWIDE RULE OF THE

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:20.065
ROAD WITHOUT ANY. LOCAL

00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:22.233
TWEAKING DESIGNATE CERTAIN

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.570
AREAS THAT'S PERMISSIVE- X.

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:31.042
EXCLUSIVE- WORKING WELL. DID

00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:31.910
YOU SEE ANY EXAMPLES WHERE IT

00:28:31.976 --> 00:28:34.612
MADE SENSE TO HAVE TO ALLOW US

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:35.246
CITIES TO HAVE. YOU KNOW THEIR

00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:37.749
THEIR OWN. SAFETY RULES THAT

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.884
MAY APPLY TO THEIR THEIR OWN

00:28:39.951 --> 00:28:41.019
LOCAL SEARCH A UNIQUE LOCAL

00:28:41.086 --> 00:28:44.889
CIRCUMSTANCES- THEY MAY ARGUE

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:45.423
AGAINST HAVING A STATEWIDE

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:50.195
STANDARDS. SO YOU KNOW YOU

00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:50.862
WOULD THINK CERTAIN THINGS LIKE

HOURS IN CERTAIN AREAS SOME

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:02.607
AREAS MAY BE MORE POPULAR FOR

00:29:02.674 --> 00:29:04.876
THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND YOU

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:08.880
WOULD. PERHAPS ONE HAVE SME

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:11.649
LOCAL FLEXIBILITY AND WHEN-

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:14.352
THE- THE HOURS OF OPERATION

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:16.087
WERE CUT OFF BECAUSE OF KIND OF

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:18.923
THAT LOCAL DIVERSITY BUT. YEAH

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.525
LUCKILY IT'S NOT MY JOB TO

YOUR TH- AND I AM NOT AWARE OF

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:28.867

NOT TOUCHED OR ARE GETTING

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:45.717
RIGHT. THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:50.355
LOOKING AT. WHEN I WHEN I WAS

STRIKE ME THAT THOSE THREE

00:29:56.794 --> 00:29:57.295
STATES THAT AUTHORIZED LOCAL

TECHNICAL SECURITY ETCETERA.

00:30:10.808 --> 00:30:12.143
THE TEAM TO BE A GOOD BALANCE

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.678
VERSUS RIGHT NOW HAVING IT

00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:15.480
COMPLETELY UP TO LOCAL

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:18.316
PERMITTING PROCESSES- BECAUSE I

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:20.051

COLLECTED THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:03.728
IDENTIFY THE COULD BE USEFUL TO

THINK. TECHNICALLY THAT COULD

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:18.009
BE POSSIBLE WITH THE SENSORS

00:31:18.076 --> 00:31:18.810

NOT AWARE OF ANY-

00:31:23.314 --> 00:31:25.083
IMPLEMENTATION THAT'S DOING

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:26.084
THAT NOW LOOKING AT. CERTAIN

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.020
JOBS TO DEVICES AND REPORTING

00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:29.621

ROOM VISITS AND THE SO THAT'S

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:06.791
WHY I. WASN'T ABLE TO COMPARE

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:07.625
THIS MODE OF TRANSPORTATION

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:10.895
WITH OTHERS- AND SO THE AN

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:12.930
INSTANCE WHERE SOMEBODY'S PATH

DEVICES AYE BUT NOT IN A

00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:19.103
WHEELCHAIR BUT I PUSH A

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.405
STROLLER OFTEN AND I'VE HAD

00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:23.975
THIS- SITUATION HAPPEN TO ME-

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:26.344
IT'S- NOT SOMETHING THAT IS

00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:27.679
TYPICALLY REPORTED SO THERE I

00:32:27.745 --> 00:32:30.548
THINK COULD BE AN UNDER

REPORTING BIAS WITH WITH SOME

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:33.918
OF THESE. ENGINE WITH THE-

EIGHTY A ACCESS AND OTHER

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:41.893
ASPECTS. THE QUEST CENTER. I'M

I'M JUST CURIOUS DO YOU HAVE A

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:44.896
PROBLEM WITH THESE DEVICES

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:47.265
BEING JUST DUMPED IN REMOTE

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:50.001
AREAS PARKS WHERE- THEY'RE NOT

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:52.136
EASILY ACCESSIBLE BY THE PUBLIC

00:32:52.203 --> 00:32:53.404
IN YOU THEN YOU'D FIND THAT

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:54.105
THEY'RE JUST SORT OF LAYING

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:56.741
AROUND LIKE ABANDONED SHOPPING

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:58.376
CARTS AND THAT SOMEBODY FROM

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:00.445
THE COMPANY HAS TO GO AND

00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:01.679
RETRIEVE THEM MORE IS THAT IN A

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:06.017
PROBLEM- SO SOME OF THE-

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:09.087
LITERATURE. TO HAS CITED SOME

00:33:09.153 --> 00:33:10.655
OF THESE DEVICES BEING PULLED

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:12.490
OUT OF LIKE MERIT IN OAKLAND

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:14.726
OUT OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN DURING

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:15.626
BEACH CLEAN UP SO THAT IS A

00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:18.062
PROBLEM IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:19.297
CITIES WANT TO HAPPEN AND IT'S

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:20.865
SOMETHING THAT THE COMPANIES I

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:22.066
THINK ARE MOTIVATED FOR

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:24.869
ECONOMIC MEANS TO TRY TO AVOID

00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:27.572
HAPPENING BUT IT THIS LOSS OF-

00:33:27.638 --> 00:33:29.173
DEVICES DUE TO THESE MECHANICAL

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.976
PROBLEMS VANDALISED SOME OR-

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:35.813
JUST- HIDING DAMAGE THEFT IS.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.914
BEEN SOMETHING THAT I THINK

00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:39.784
IT'S PLAGUED THE LONGEVITY OF

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:40.918
THE FIRST FEW GENERATIONS OF

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:43.454
DEVICES THAT WERE DEPLOYED IN

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:44.422
CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:45.990
COUNTRY I'M JUST WONDERING IF

00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:47.492
IT'S IF IT'S A LOSS OF THE

00:33:47.558 --> 00:33:49.861
DEVICE TO NOT JUST BECAUSE OF

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:52.997
THEFT VANDALISM BUT AT. A ONE

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:54.465
WAY TRIP TO TAKE IN AND IT'S

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:56.434
JUST LEFT SOMEWHERE WHERE IT'S

00:33:56.501 --> 00:33:58.136
NOT AND IT PLACE FOR SOMEBODY

00:33:58.202 --> 00:34:00.104
WOULD READILY BE WANTING TO USE

00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:02.874
IT PER SE IF AND IT MAY NOT BE

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.742
AN ISSUE FOR THE COMPANIES TO

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:07.779
EMPLOY- WAR CONTRACT WITH

00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:08.546
PEOPLE TO RE BALANCE SO TO

00:34:08.613 --> 00:34:11.082
COLLECT FROM. THESE TYPES OF

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:12.750
AREAS TO BRING BACK WITHIN A

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:16.287
SERVICE HERE AT TO CHARGEOVERNIGHT TO MAINTAIN- BUT

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:21.626
CHALLENGE BEING THAT IF. THE

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:22.160
DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS AND NO

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:26.531
LONGER REPORTS ITS LOCATION.

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:27.965
THEY CAN'T FIND IT SO- BUT IN

00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:28.966
GENERAL THERE IS HOPE A

00:34:29.033 --> 00:34:29.567
MECHANISM FOR THAT OKAY THANK

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:13.331

FRANCISCO THE RESULTS WERE

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:30.314
STILL QUITE SHOCKING THE

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:32.016
IMPACTS ARE VERY REAL ON OUR

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:34.485

THE CITY BONDARIES WERE MADE

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:42.994
BY T. AND SEES. WHICH IS ABOUT

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.228
TWELVE TIMES A NUMBER OF TAXI

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.441
IN A MORE RECENT STUDY USING

00:37:57.508 --> 00:37:59.644

00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:03.547
THAT TNC IS ACCOUNT 413% OF

VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN THE

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:07.918
CORE OF SAN FRANCISCO. WHY IT

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:11.722
MATTERS. TNC OPERATIONS CAN

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:12.757
CREATE SAFETY HAZARDS FOR ALL

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:15.760
ROAD USERS. TNC OPERATIONS

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:17.628
OFTEN RESULT IN RISKY TRAVEL

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.430

DATA FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:38:30.941 --> 00:38:33.711
INDICATES THAT TNC IS COMPRISED

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:37.081
64% OF MOVING VIOLATIONS IN SAN

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.583
FRANCISCO'S DOWNTOWN CORE.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.951
THESE DANGEROUS PICK UP AND

00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:43.020
DROP OFF BEHAVIORS LEAD TO

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:44.422
HAZARDS IN INJURIES TO CYCLISTS

00:38:44.488 --> 00:38:46.390

SIGNIFICANTLY INTERFERE WITH

TRANSIT VEHICLES. MORE TNC

00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:52.797
VEHICLES ON THE STREETS CAN

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:53.898
LEAD TO MORE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:57.334

THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- MUCH

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.248
LIKE THIS TORRENT HERE WE

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:06.650
REGULATE TAXICABS. AS WELL AS

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:07.918

TRANSIT TO A CERTAIN DEGREE SO.

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:16.694
IN LOS ANGELES WE REGULATE

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.328
QUITE A BIT IN TERMS OF THE FOR

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:20.064
HIRE VEHICLE SPACE. MUCH I

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:20.864
FRANKLY AGREE WITH A LOT OF

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:22.266
WHAT MR AND IS ALREADY STATED

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:24.601
HERE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I

00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:25.235
THINK THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS

00:43:25.302 --> 00:43:28.205
THAT. BECAUSE WE HAVE A TWO

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:30.274
TIERED SYSTEM AND WE'RE UNABLE

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:44.989
THROUGH THE STATE. IN LOS

00:43:45.055 --> 00:43:45.556
ANGELES AND I THINK THIS IS

00:43:45.622 --> 00:43:48.092
TRUE ALSO IN SAN FRANCISCO. OUR

00:43:48.158 --> 00:43:49.526
GOALS ARE ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE

00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:51.729
IN TERMS OF WE LOOK FOR THE FOR

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:53.063
HIRE SPACE AND WE'RE CONCERNED

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.699
ABOUT THE SAFETY. EQUITY

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:56.533
ACCESSIBILITY AND

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.669
SUSTAINABILITY. AGAIN THESE ARE

00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:00.304
THINGS THAT WE FOCUS ON HEAVILY

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:01.672
WITH ARE REGULATED SPACE SUCH

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:04.208

NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL BUT WE

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.344
HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THIS AS IT

00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:09.680
RELATES TO UBER AND LIFT OR ANY

00:44:09.747 --> 00:44:12.049
OTHER TNC MODEL. SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:44:12.116 --> 00:44:14.918
IN THE SAFETY SPACE DRIVERS IN

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:16.086
TAXICABS THIS IS TRUE ALSO IN

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:19.656
SAN FRANCISCO ARE FINGERPRINTED

00:44:19.723 --> 00:44:20.290

PROGRAM WHICH ARE ELDERLY AND

00:44:24.895 --> 00:44:28.098

TRIPS ARE SUBCONTRACTED THROUGH

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.068
OUR TAXI CAB PROVIDERS AND ONE

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:33.070
OF THE MAIN REASONS THEY'RE

00:44:33.137 --> 00:44:33.637
ABLE TO DO THAT THROUGH THIS

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:35.406
FEDERAL PROGRAMS BECAUSE- A

00:44:35.472 --> 00:44:37.741

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:39.810
AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION FOR CITY

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:40.377
AS AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION FOR

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:43.781
RESIDENTS. IN TERMS OF SAFETY

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:47.618
IT'S A TNC DRIVER. LET'S SAY-

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:50.087
FOR ANY TNC A TEENSY DRIVER AND

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:50.954
DOES SOMETHING THAT ON TOWARD

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:53.123
TOWARD THE PASSENGER UNLESS IT

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.092
RISES TO THE LEVEL OF AN ARREST

00:44:55.159 --> 00:44:56.393
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR ABOUT

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.095
IT. IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT

00:44:58.162 --> 00:44:59.396
HAPPENS IN THE TAXICABS SPACE

00:44:59.463 --> 00:45:00.497
OR EVEN MY NOT EMERGENCY

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:02.199
MEDICAL SPACE WE HEAR ABOUT IT

00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:03.500
FIRST AND WE MANAGE IT AND WE

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:06.403
HANDLE IT WHETHER IT'S A

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.937
COMPLAINT. WHETHER IT'S AN

00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:09.139
ARREST. OUR CITIES REGULATE

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:11.341
THOSE ISSUES. FOR NEWER DRIVERS

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:13.677
ARRESTED OR SOMETHING HAPPENS

00:45:13.744 --> 00:45:15.145
BE MAY BE DEACTIVATED IMPROPER

00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:17.781
FORM. WE MAY WE DON'T WE DON'T

00:45:17.848 --> 00:45:18.282
ACTUALLY KNOW IF THAT'S

00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:19.249
HAPPENING. BUT EVEN IF THEY

00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:20.751
ARE. THERE'S NOTHING THAT

00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:21.952
NECESSARILY PREVENTS THEM FROM

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:23.187
CONTINUING TO DRIVE FOR LIFT

00:45:23.253 --> 00:45:24.555
AND AS MANY OF YOU ALREADY

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:26.490
LIKELY SEE. MANY DRIVERS HAVE

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.358
AN UBER AND LIFT STICKER. SO

00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:29.626
SOMETHING HAPPENS ON ONE

00:45:29.693 --> 00:45:31.128
PLATFORM IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:32.529
HAPENS TO THEM ON THE OTHER

00:45:32.596 --> 00:45:34.264
PLATFORM. IF SOMETHING HAPPENS

00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:35.232
WITH OUR DRIVERS IN THE TAXI

00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:37.367
CAB SPACE. IF I HAVE A YELLOW

00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:39.203
CAB DRIVER THAT DOES SOMETHING

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:40.003
ON TOUR TO A PASSENGER WE

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.005
REMOVE THEM. THEY CAN GO TO

00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:43.674
ANOTHER CAP COMPANY ANYWHERE IN

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.842
LOS ANGELES WHY BECAUSE WE

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:46.610
MANAGE THEIR PERMIT. WE'RE THE

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:48.245
ONES WHO KNOW WHAT GOES ON WE

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:49.580
KNOW EVERY SINGLE DRIVER THAT

00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:54.017
OPERATES IN OUR CITY. WE DON'T

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:54.651
KNOW ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS WITH

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:57.888
THE DRIVERS AND TEA AND SEES.

00:45:57.955 --> 00:45:58.489
IN TERMS OF EQUITY WE'RE VERY

00:45:58.555 --> 00:45:59.523
CONCERNED ABOUT REDLINING.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.825
WE'RE VERY LARGE CITY. POWER

00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:04.628
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE MILES.

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:05.896
BETWEEN FOUR FIVE MILLION IN

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:07.431
POPULATION THAT'S JUST FOR THE

00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:10.200
CITY OUR COUNTY IS CLOSE TO

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:10.834
FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE MILES WITH

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:11.368
A POPULATION OF ABOUT TEN

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:13.537
MILLION PEOPLE. AND WITH THAT

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:15.139
IT'S IMPORTANT TO US THAT

00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:17.407
SERVICES ON THE WEST SIDE. ARE

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:18.976
JUST AS GOOD AS SERVICES ON THE

00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:20.377
EAST SIDE OR THE SOUTH RIM THE

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:21.979
NORTH PART OF THE CITY. WE WANT

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.080
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:24.348
EQUIVALENT SERVICE THROUGHOUT

00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:25.315
THE CITY AND THAT'S SOMETHING

00:46:25.382 --> 00:46:26.350
THAT WE FIGHT HARD FOR OUR

00:46:26.416 --> 00:46:28.018
TAXICABS SPACE. AND THAT'S

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:29.720
SOMETHING THAT AGAIN WE HAVE NO

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:31.054
CONTROL OVER AND THE TNC

00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:34.158
SPACES. ACCESSIBILITY MYSTERON

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:35.325
MENTION. WHEELCHAIR

00:46:35.392 --> 00:46:37.127
ACCESSIBILITY IS SOMETHING THAT

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:39.029
ALL TAXICABS WE FOCUS ON

00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:40.030
HAPPILY WE REQUIRE PERCENTAGE

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:41.298
OF OUR FLEET TO BE WHEELCHAIR

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:42.933
ACCESSIBLE. THE SAN FRANCISCO

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.701
FLEET IN THE EXACT SAME THING.

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:48.205

ANYONE THERE YOU KNOW AND I

00:46:52.075 --> 00:46:52.609
THINK THEY MAY BE HERE TODAY

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:53.844
THEY CAN TALK ABOUT THAT

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:55.012
THEMSELVES WITH WE'LL HAVE

00:46:55.078 --> 00:46:56.146

CONTRACT NOW WITH OTHER.

OUTSIDE ENTITIES BUT AGAIN AS A

00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:02.920
CITY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S

00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:03.720
IMPORTANT TO US FOR OUR

00:47:03.787 --> 00:47:06.089
CUSTOMERS AND WE DO A OF THE

00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:07.357
PRETTY HARD JOB TRYING TO PUT

THAT TOGETHER MAKE SURE THAT

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:10.427
THAT HAPPENS FOR THEM. AND THEN

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:12.396
FINALLY WHAT SUSTAINABILITY.

00:47:12.462 --> 00:47:13.931

MOVE MORE TOWARDS AN EEVEE

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:16.333
FUTURE AND TWO IS MORE CLEAN

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.303
AIR FUTURE. THAT'S BECAUSE WE

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:21.138

MINUTE. AND SO AGAIN THESE ARE

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:45.929
THINGS BECAUSE WE HAVE NO DATA

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:25.369
INFORMATION OF THE LACK OF

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:27.070

FRANKLY ARE UNABLE TO PLUG THEM

00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:30.674
INTO THAT SYSTEM THAT WILL

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:32.376

PERMIT PROGRAM WHERE NOW WE

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:41.758
REQUIRE THE SCOOTERS TO BE

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:43.326

00:54:05.675 --> 00:54:07.310
HAPPENING AND THERE WAS NO

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:10.046
ABILITY AS A PUBLIC AGENCY TO

00:54:10.113 --> 00:54:12.282
ANSWER THAT OR UNDERSTAND THAT

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:14.117
THEY'RE ALSO FEES THAT THE CPC

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:16.753
COLLECTS FROM- TEEN SEES THEY

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.388
WERE REDUCED A COUPLE YEARS

00:54:18.455 --> 00:54:20.657
AGO- WE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WERE

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:22.258
VERY CURIOUS HOW MUCH HAS BEEN

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:24.160
COLLECTED IN WHAT HAS IT BEEN

00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:26.963
SPENT ON. AND WHY REDUCE WE

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.431
HAVE SOME IDEAS ON WHERE THAT

00:54:28.498 --> 00:54:30.800
MONEY COULD BE SPENT IT COULD

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:32.202
BE SPENT TO SUPPORT LOCAL

00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:33.737
ENFORCEMENT DISABILITY ACCESS

00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:35.005
THIS BEFORE THIRTEEN SEVENTY

00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:38.875
SIX- BUT THOSE ARE IN BUT WE

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:40.377
DIDN'T KNOW WE DIDN'T KNOW

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:41.211
WHERE HOW MUCH IS COLLECTED

00:54:41.277 --> 00:54:43.046
WHERE IT WENT WHAT TYPE OF IN

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:44.614
FORCE AND HAPPENING THERE IS A

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:47.083
STATE LAW THAT- TEEN.

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.118
COMMERCIAL DRIVERS CAN ONLY DO

00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:50.720
HAVE CERTAIN- ON OF CONSECUTIVE

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:52.555
HOURS ALSO THERE'S THAT STATE

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:54.190
LAW ON THE BOOKS BUT WE'RE NOT

00:54:54.257 --> 00:55:00.130
SURE IS IT BEING ENFORCED OR.

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:00.697
NOT SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:06.803
QUESTIONS WE HAVE. JUST FOLLOW

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:07.804
THAT UP WITH A IT DID YOU WANT

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:08.438
TO ADD ON TO THAT I'M SORRY I'M

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:09.072
NO THAT'S WORK EXPERIENCE IN

00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:09.773
THE EXACT SAME THING LOS

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:10.407
ANGELES WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN

00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:11.675
ANY DATA AND- EVEN IN TERMS OF

00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:12.609
ENFORCEMENT WE'RE FRANKLY. I'M

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:13.743
SURE OF THE CDC HAS THE

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.644
RESOURCES TO ENFORCE IN THE

00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:16.546
CITY CRITICALLY OF OUR SIZE

00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:18.648
WHERE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:19.883
POINT NINE MILLION TNC TRIPS

00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:23.186
COME OUT OF LAX- LAST YEAR. AND

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:25.455
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I DON'T KNOW

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:27.657
HOW LARGE THE PCS BUT I'M

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:28.825
CERTAIN THEIR ENFORCEMENT

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:31.294
CANNOT COVER. EVEN JUST AND

00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:31.995
THAT'S JUST THE NUMBERS WE

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:33.630
KNOW- FROM LA X. IT WAS AND

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:35.899
TELL US I MEAN DRIVERS WE HAVE-

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:37.534
AND THAT'S JUST FOR. THAT

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.670
AIRPORT SO THOSE NUMBERS ALONE

00:55:40.737 --> 00:55:41.438
SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:42.605
LOOKING AT LOS ANGELES APART

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:44.541
LOOKING AT. HUNDREDS MAYBE OF

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:46.476
OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO

00:55:46.543 --> 00:55:47.410
HUNDRED THOUSAND DRIVERS. AND

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:49.379
AGAIN. WE HAVE NO INFORMATION

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:54.751
ON IF THAT'S ACTUALLY ACCURATE.

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:55.351
OR NOT WE HAVE NO INFORMATION.

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:55.952
THAT MIGHT BE A HEARING IN ITS

00:55:56.019 --> 00:56:00.390
OWN. ONE OTHER QUESTION- TO

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:01.424
BOTH YOU AS OF- JANUARY FIRST-

00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:03.126
AB FIVE WILL BE. PUT INTO LAW

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:03.727
WHICH WILL MAKE TNC OPERATORS

00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:08.098
EMPLOYEES. AT THISPOINT- DO

00:56:08.164 --> 00:56:09.699
YOU FEEL THAT THERE WILL BE AN

00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:12.135
ABILITY TO WORK WITH HI DATA

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:15.238
COLLECTION ON AS A WHOLE AS AN

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:15.805
EMPLOYER VERSES INDEPENDENT

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.574
CONTRACTORS HAVING TO. DO YOU

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.542
FEEL WHAT HE FEELS GOING ON

00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:21.177
THERE IS MOVING THE BALL AS FAR

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:24.114
AS- RESPONSIBILITY AND- OF

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:27.884
REPORTING. I THINK THAT'S A

00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:28.818
GREAT QUESTION THAT'S REALLY

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:31.054
INTERESTING I HAVE NOT. HEARD

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:33.323
THOSE TWO TOPICS PAIRED LIKE

00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:35.325
THAT AND SO I THINK THAT'S

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:37.293
INSIGHTFUL- FOR US TO FOLLOW UP

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.230
ON- BUT AS IT STANDS WITH THE

00:56:40.296 --> 00:56:42.966
CPC AT THIS POINT THERE IS NO

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:45.068
ABILITY TO ACCESS ANY OF THAT

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:46.436
DATA SO I'M NOT SURE IF THE

00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:48.438
EMPLOYMENT STATUS IS GOING TO

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:50.573
ALLOW SOME TYPE OF ENTREE. BUT

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.609
CERTAINLY WORTH PURSUING IN

00:56:52.675 --> 00:56:56.045
ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS. AND I

00:56:56.112 --> 00:56:57.347
AGREE WITH MR WITH MISS TO OUR

00:56:57.413 --> 00:56:59.349
AND I THINK THE ISSUE WITH THAT

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:01.551
IS SIMPLY. FOR EXAMPLE OF NEW

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:03.720
YORK CITY HAS A REQUIREMENT

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:06.222
THAT TNC DRIVERS HAVE TO MAKE A

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:06.856
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THIS

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:08.691
SPACE UT I UTILIZATION. BUT

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:10.126
THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE

00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:11.528
THEY HAVE ALL THE DATA THEY

00:57:11.594 --> 00:57:12.896
KNOW WHO THE DRIVERS ARE THEY

00:57:12.962 --> 00:57:14.731
KNOW HOW MANY DRIVERS THERE

00:57:14.798 --> 00:57:15.532
THERE ARE AND THEY CAN SEE WHAT

00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:16.699
THE UTILIZATION THIS SO THAT

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:18.568
THE- MAN THEY ARE ABLE TO

00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:20.470
DETERMINE. HOW MUCH HAS TO BE

00:57:20.537 --> 00:57:23.940
PUT IN TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:57:24.007 --> 00:57:24.507
DRIVER EARNS ENOUGH MONEY TO

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:28.945
KEEP WORKING. FOUR GUYS OF THE

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:29.512
CHANGED AB FIVE IF WE DON'T

00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:30.780
HAVE ANY OF THAT DATA. IT'S

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:32.215
UNKNOWN TO US WHETHER THEY'RE

00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:33.850
GONNA BE MAKING THE IN THE

00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:34.717
REQUISITE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:36.553
NEED TO SURVIVE IN LOS ANGELES

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:38.621
OR NOT SO. AGAIN DATA IS REALLY

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:40.056
THE KEY. ON THOSE ISSUES AND IF

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:41.491
WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA. THEN

00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:44.961
IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHAT. YOU

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:45.562
KNOW WHAT CHANGES COULD OCCUR

00:57:45.628 --> 00:57:49.299
WITH AB FIVE. IT HAS SOLD HIS.

00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:50.867
HOME WHAT I'M- TAKING IN. FROM

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:51.901
YOUR STATEMENTS BUT SEE IF YOU

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:52.535
SEE THAT THEY MAY BE

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:54.270
OVERWHELMED. OF NOT ONLY IN

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:57.040
FIRE SITUATIONS BUT- IN THE

00:57:57.106 --> 00:57:59.008
TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS ALSO IN

00:57:59.075 --> 00:57:59.876
THAT WE MAY HAVE TO BIFURCATE

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:01.444
THIS AGENCIES SO IT.

00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:03.079
RESPONSIBILITY ACTUALLY CAN BE

00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:07.050
EFFECTIVE- TO MANAGE AND ALSO

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:07.584
AID LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:10.720
THEIR EFFORTS. WELL WE'RE

00:58:10.787 --> 00:58:11.354
CERTAINLY HERE TO BE A PARTNER

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.356
WITH- AND FORCING AND HELPING

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:15.825
TO MANAGE TNC OPERATIONS. RIGHT

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:16.993
WE WANT TO BE A PART OF THE

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.828
ECOSYSTEM AND THEY'VE DONE A

00:58:18.895 --> 00:58:20.296
GOOD SERVICE SO FAR I MEAN IN

00:58:20.363 --> 00:58:22.765
TERMS OF THAT BUT IN ORDER TO

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:23.700
HELP US. MOVE FORWARD IN THE

00:58:23.766 --> 00:58:25.969
FUTURE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:30.039
HAVE SOME SAY IN WHAT GOES ON.

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:31.241

MADE IT TO THE FRONT. PAGE OF

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:48.791
THE CALIFORNIA SECTION OF THE

00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:51.661
LA TIMES. WHERE THE CITY IS

00:58:51.728 --> 00:58:54.631
PULLED. HOOVER'S PERMIT. AND SO

00:58:54.697 --> 00:58:55.398
IF I IF I COULD JUST READ A

00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:56.599
PARAGRAPH FOUR I'M STILL TRYING

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:59.869
TO. GET MY ARMS AROUND IT SAYS

00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:00.803
THE SUSPENSION FOLLOWS MONTHS

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:02.639
OF TENSION AND FAILED ATTEMPTS.

00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:04.474
AT COMPROMISE BETWEEN UBER IN

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:05.742
THE CITY OVER A DATA SHARING

00:59:05.808 --> 00:59:07.543
RULE. AND ALWAYS WHEN YOUR

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:09.379
PILOT PERMIT PROGRAM. COMPANIES

00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:11.214
MUST SHARE REAL TIMEDATA ON

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:13.616
ALL TRIPS MADE WITHIN THE CITY.

00:59:13.683 --> 00:59:15.518
INCLUDING THE START POINT. IN

00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:17.754
POINT AND TRAVEL TIME. AND I'M

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:18.788
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:20.123
THAT'S SO CRITICAL SO MAYBE THE

00:59:20.189 --> 00:59:22.025
FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS. DO WE

00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:24.494
REQUIRE THAT FOR TAXI DRIVERS.

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.195
THAT YELLOW CAB TO IT TO ALL

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:28.698
PROVIDED TO THE CITY. YES WE DO

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:29.732
AND ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:32.201
DO IN TERMS OF- SEE LOS ANGELES

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:33.503
IS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THAT TO

00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:35.638
REAL TIME DATA. BECAUSE RIGHT

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:36.940
NOW TECHNOLOGICALLY TAXICABS

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:38.741
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP.

00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:40.009
WITH THE TIMES WE KNOW THE

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:41.511
TECHNOLOGY EXISTS. SO THEY

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:43.446
PROVIDE DATA TO US MONTHLY ON

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:44.681
WHETHER TRIPS ARE HOW MANY

00:59:44.747 --> 00:59:46.849
TRIPS- BUT- APPARENTLY IT'S

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:48.918
SOMEONE WHO'S BRING IN THAT

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:49.819
INFORMATION IN A FORMAT THAT'S

00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:50.420
NOT REALLY USABLE FOR US IN.

00:59:50.486 --> 00:59:51.988
ANYMORE AND SO AND WE'RE GONNA

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:53.623
BE MOVING THEM ONTO A PLATFORM

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:54.824
MUCH LIKE WE DO WITH OTHER

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:56.459
SCOOTERS IN LOS ANGELES. THAT

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:58.261
ALLOWS US TO SEE WHAT GOES ON

00:59:58.328 --> 00:59:59.395
AND WHERE THE CHIPS ARE WITH

00:59:59.462 --> 01:00:00.830
THE TAXICABS. AND WE'RE GONNA

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:02.098
BE MOVING THIS TO ALL OF OUR

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:02.799
FOR HIGHER VEHICLES ARE

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:04.167
SHUTTLES AS WELL AS OUR NON

INTEREST CREATING ZONES- SEEING

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:18.014
WHERE THE CHIPS ARE AND-

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.582
PREVENTING THE RED LINING

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:20.883
ISSUES SO. THE TECHNOLOGY

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.385
CURRENTLY EXIST. WE'RE MOVING

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.287

FOR. HELPFUL TO ME- THANK YOU

01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:39.736
FOR THAT RESPONSE BECAUSE I'M

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:41.004
A- NO BETTER NO WORSE KIND OF

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.005
PERSON IF. TAXI COME TO RE

01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:44.807
DOING IT THEN TNC IS. SHOULD BE

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:45.742
DOING LIKE I OKAY I APPRECIATE

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:46.542
THAT SO WITH THE DATA FROM THE

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:48.244
TAXI COMPANIES- IN BOTH CITIES

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.946
BOTH THEIR AREAS- ARE WE ARE WE

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:52.148
SEEING MORE PEOPLE THAN USING.

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:53.016
SOME FORM OF TRANSPORTATION

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:53.549
THAT THEY'RE COMPENSATING

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:55.952
SOMEONE FOR OR OR TAXIS

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:58.488
DECLINING ANTEON SEES.

01:00:58.554 --> 01:00:59.122
INCREASING ABOUT THE AVERAGE IS

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:02.125
STILL THE SAME. WELL I THINK

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:03.659
THE PIE HAS GROWN I THINK THE

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:04.994
STUDIES SHOW THAT MORE PEOPLE

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.430
ARE USING MORE FOR HIGHER

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:10.700
SERVICES AND- THERE BEEN MANY

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:11.701
STUDIES ON THIS AND THERE'S

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:14.303
EVEN A LOOK AT A PUBLIC TRANSIT

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.072
AND IN MANY AREAS ACROSS THE

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:18.041
COUNTRY PUBLIC TRANSIT

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:20.410
RIDERSHIP IS DECLINING WHILE

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:22.345
TNC TRIPS ARE GOING UP AND

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:24.981
TYPICALLY OVER THE PAST. EIGHT

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:26.215
TEN YEARS TAXI TRIPS HAVE BEEN

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:29.385
DECLINING SO- BUT I THINK THERE

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:30.887
WAS A LOT OF WEIGHT AND DEMAND

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:33.022
THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS THAT

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:34.757
HAVE BEEN GOING ON RELATED TO

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:37.927
THE VARIOUS TRIP LEVELS- IN

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:39.629
ANOTHER POINT ON THE DATA NOT

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:40.963
SURE IF THIS IS HELPFUL AS WELL

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:44.267
BUT- THERE ARE- AGAIN THE STATE

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:46.502
REQUIREMENTS AND GREENHOUSE GAS

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:48.771
EMISSION REDUCTIONS WE HAVE OUR

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:50.807

UNDERSTAND THE DECLINE IN ARE

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.915
WE MEETING OUR GOALS AND-

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:01.751

ARE NOT ABLE TO EASILY ANSWER

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.628
THOSE QESTIONS AND SO THEY'RE

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:14.630
GOING OUT AND HAVING A SURVEY

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:16.065
OR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WORK

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.134
AROUND. HOW CAN WE TRY TO

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.836
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:22.805
THE SECTOR AND YET THAT DATA IS

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:27.410
BEING PROVIDED TO THE CPC IT'S

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:27.977

NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER LA ACTS

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:30.239

AIRPORT PROPER. BUT WHAT WE YOU

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.175
HAVE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN TERMS

01:03:32.241 --> 01:03:33.276
OF THE NUMBER OF TRIPS IS THAT

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.077
OBVIOUSLY TEENS TEACHERS HAVE

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.045
INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY IN THAT

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:39.182
AREA. AND TAXI CHIPS- DECLINED

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:41.117
TO A CERTAIN DEGREE- AT THE

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:42.919
PEAK FOR TAXI TRIPS IS ABOUT

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:44.687
ONE POINT SIX MILLION-

TWO MILLION- GIVE OR TAKE SO.

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.827
WELL THE DECLINE HAS BEEN A

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:52.895
RELATIVELY STEEP IT'S SOMEWHAT

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.997
PLATEAU TO A CERTAIN DEGREE.

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:56.032

THINK WHAT KATE MENTION WAS

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:01.971
THAT. THERE'S A BIGGER PIECE OF

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:03.873
THE PIE NOW. AND THAT'S VERY

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.309
MUCH TRUE SO. YOU KNOW WHAT

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:07.410

OF OUR TO. CAP THE- NBA PLAYER.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.666
AT A GIVEN TIME. THAT IS SO

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:31.968
IT'S NOT A SUPER COMPLICATED

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:34.503
SYSTEM JUST TO GIVE YOU AN

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:41.043

THAT TO MANAGE CONGESTION AT

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:54.390
THE AIRPORT TO INSERT TO ENSURE

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:55.324
THAT WE DON'T HAVE. THREE HOUR

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:00.563
THAT. WE DO NOT HAVE THAT

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:01.764
AUTHORITY OVER TNC SO WE DON'T

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:02.565
HAVE THE LUXURY TO BE ABLE TO

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:03.499
SAY. HEY IT'S INCREDIBLY

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.234

CONGESTION WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:11.007
KIND OF AUTHORITY CURRENTLY SO-

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.708
THAT IS IT AN ISSUE FOR US

01:05:12.775 --> 01:05:14.210

ABOUT THE- MIKE REMOTE MOBILITY.

01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:35.298
PRIVATE COMPANIES FORMING

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:36.899
PARTNERSHIPS WITH PUBLIC

KINDS OF. A PUBLIC MOBILITY

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:47.076
ORGANIZATIONS AND. ONE OF THE

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:49.445
QUESTIONS I HAD IF THAT'S GOT

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:50.546
USED DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:54.417
TO BE A TREND IN THE FUTURE FOR

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:55.418
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:57.720
TRANSPORTATION GENERAL AND THEN

01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:02.591
THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHEN WE-

01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:04.560
THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATE

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:05.761
GOVERNMENT GIVES GRANTS AND

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:10.633
FUNDING TO- TRANSPORTATION. ONE

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.335
OF THE STANDARD FOR NO NONSENSE

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:13.602
REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE TO

01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:16.038
OBSERVE THE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:19.008
AMERICAN DISABILITY ACT. YOU

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:23.579
AFFIRMATIVE LEE AND FORCING OUT

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:27.116
SO. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT- WHETHER

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:28.584
OR NOT YOU THINK THAT'S GOING

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:31.320
TO HAPPEN AND IF SO. IN TERMS

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:33.723
OF LOOKING AHEAD TO THE FUTURE.

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:36.092
LIKE WE ARE WE SHOULD. HOW WILL

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:40.262
THE- AMERICAN DISABILITY- ACTS-

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:43.265
AND EQUAL ACCESS- EQUAL ACCESS

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:44.934
TO ME MEANS LIKE NOT REDLINING

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.169
BASED ON RACE CREED COLOR OTHER

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:51.006
KINDS OF FACTORS. HOW CAN WE

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:53.876
ENFORCE THE LAW. OF THAT WE'RE

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:55.911
SUPPOSED TO ENFORCE WERE FIRMLY

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:58.381
RESPONSIBLE FOR. CAN YOU CAN

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:01.417
YOU ADDRESS THAT ISSUE PLEASE.

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:03.486
SURE WELL IN TERMS OF THE

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:05.287
BUSINESS MODELS IN THE PUBLIC

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:07.857
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS I THINK. I

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:09.091
THINK THE JURY'S STILL OUT ON

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:10.893
THAT IT'S SUCH A NEW INDUSTRY

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.729
AND- AT THIS POINT I THINK

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:15.564
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF SETTLING

01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:18.033
IN TO HAPPEN SO I'M NOT SURE I

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.236
SEE A CLEAR PATH FOR THAT MAYBE

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:21.837
MR MURRAY SEES MORE THAN I SEE

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.372
THERE BUT I THINK THAT THE-

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:24.473
THAT WE DON'T KNOW YET I THINK

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.576
IT'S STILL EARLY ON- IN TERMS

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:28.477
OF THE AMERICANS WITH

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:30.045
DISABILITIES. BILL IT HE'S ACT

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:32.181
AND EQUAL ACCESS EQUITY THAT'S

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:34.183
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US AND-

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.718
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR

OF THE JURY IS STILL OUT- IS

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:21.417
THAT THERE'S- I DON'T THINK

THERE'S AN EASY. VEHICLE TYPE

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:26.088

CITY. WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO

A LOT OF TIME. AND ENERGY

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:57.019
ENGAGING WITH OUR PRIVATE

ANSWER IS SELF REGULATION. I

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:11.867
THINK- WITH THE WAY THE- TNC

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:13.068
SEVEN REGULATED CURRENTLY IT'S

01:11:13.135 --> 01:11:15.137
ESSENTIALLY SELF REGULATION AND

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:16.538

MICHAEL MOBILITY. IF THE ANSWER

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:20.709
IF THE INTEL IF THE ANSWER IS

THAT'S THE WAY TO GO I THINK

01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:29.084
IT'S MUCH MORE IMPORTANT- TO

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:30.886
SAY THAT THERE'S A PARTNERSHIP.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:32.688

THERE SHOULD BE SOME LOCAL. A

01:11:38.827 --> 01:11:40.195

INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:44.446
COMMENTS ABOUT CABS IN HEARING

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:46.181
SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:47.216
BENEFITS OF TRADITIONAL CABS

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:48.383
AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:49.685
THAT. YOU KNOW THE CAP

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:51.153
CERTAINLY DO A LOT OF BENEFITS

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.421
AND THEY'RE EASIER FOR CITIES

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:53.956
TO REGULATE BUT THE REASON THAT

01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:56.158
CABS ARE ARE NOT THE PREFERRED

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:57.993
MODE OF TRAVEL IS VERY OBVIOUS

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.127
TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TAKEN

01:14:59.194 --> 01:15:01.730
CABS AND TAKEN. RIDE SHARES THE

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:02.965
LAST TIME I TOOK A CAB IN LOS

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:04.399
ANGELES WAS MANY YEARS AGO AND

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:06.034
I REMEMBER HAVING TO TRAVEL

01:15:06.101 --> 01:15:07.502
JUST A COUPLE MILES AND TAKING

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.304
A CAB BECAUSE I YOU KNOW HAD

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:10.873
BAGS OR SOMETHING AND I THINK

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:11.473
THAT TWO MILE TRIP COST ME

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.176
ABOUT EIGHTY DOLLARS- YOU KNOW

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:16.078
THIS WAS BACK BEFORE- UBER AND

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:17.579
LIFT WERE THERE TO DO THAT

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:19.681
COMPETITION AND- OF BEING IN A-

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:20.983
THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN A

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:22.384
CAB COMPARED TO BEING IN MOST

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:24.586
RIDE CHER VEHICLES IS PROFOUND.

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:25.988
AND IN TERMS OF REDLINING I

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.256
WHEN I USED TO LIVE IN BED STUY

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:28.924
IN BROOKLYN BELIEVE ME THERE'S

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:31.193
A LOT OF REDLINING IN NEW YORK-

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.160
EVEN WITH THEIR HIGHLY

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:34.129
REGULATED A CAB COMPANIES

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:35.964
ANYWAY TO TRY TO GET A CAB FROM

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:37.666
MANHATTAN TO BROOKLYN- LATE AT

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:40.335
NIGHT KNOWS THAT IT'S ALL KINDS

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:43.105
OF REDLINING THAT GOES ON ITS

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:45.974
RACIAL AND JUST IN TERMS TO

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:50.612
YOU. AUGUST THIS BILL. YOU KNOW

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:53.815
WHAT WE HAVE DONE. BUT TO THEM

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:54.283
WHEN PEOPLE USE THEIR

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:55.550
POCKETBOOKS TO SHOW THAT THEY

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:56.718
NEED A METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:57.786
THAT IS SEAT THAT THEY FEEL

01:15:57.853 --> 01:15:58.453
SAFE THAT'S CONVENIENT AND

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.454
THAT'S AFFORDABLE FOR THEM

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:00.355
THAT'S WHEN WE START SEEING

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:01.790
YOUNG PEOPLE DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:03.492
TALKING ABOUT WANTING TO DO FOR

01:16:03.558 --> 01:16:04.793
A LONG TIME WHICH IS SAY I

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:07.429
DON'T NEED TO HAVE A CAR. AT

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:09.031
EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY ONE THAT NOW

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:11.199
I'M GONNA ACTUALLY TRUST USING

01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:12.501
TNC IS PLUS PUBLIC

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:13.669
TRANSPORTATION AND WE HAVE THIS

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.070
REALLY GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY WITH

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:16.738
THIS GENERATION TO HARNESS

01:16:16.805 --> 01:16:19.942
THAT- BUT ONLY IF WE ALLOW THE

01:16:20.008 --> 01:16:23.278
WITH. THE. ASPECTS OF THAT

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:24.913
TRANSPORTATION MODALITY THAT'S

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.715
SO ATTRACTIVE TO THEM TO

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:29.618
CONTINUE AND NOT TO TRY TO SET

01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:30.252
UP A PARADIGM TO GO YOU KNOW TO

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:32.554
MOVE THAT BACK. TO GET THOSE

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:33.822
THINGS THAT WE HAD WITH CABS

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:35.057
THAT ACTUALLY WAS CAUSING THEM

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:36.792
TO BE OUT OF UNAFFORDABLE FOR A

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:39.027
LOT OF PEOPLE NOT CONVENIENT

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:42.564
AND CERTAINLY NOT PLEASANT- SO

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:43.498
YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST SOMETHING

01:16:43.565 --> 01:16:44.599
WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND AND YOU

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:45.600
KNOW I GUESS I COULD SAY THIS

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:47.202
AT THE END BUT I'LL SAY IT NOW.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.070
YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE ISSUES

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:49.104
THAT WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S WITH

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:51.406
MICROBIOLOGY WAS SCOOTERS THAT

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:52.207
WE PUT ON THE BACKS OF THE

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:54.509
SCOOTERS THINGS LIKE SAFETY.

01:16:54.576 --> 01:16:55.544
REALLY SHOULDN'T BE ON THEM AND

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:56.945
YES THEY SHOULD HAVE A SAFE A

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:58.246
SAFER VEHICLES POSSIBLE AND

01:16:58.313 --> 01:16:59.614
IT'S GREAT WHEN THEY HAVE THE

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:00.449
THREE WHEELED VEHICLES THAT

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:01.650
MORE SENIORS CAN RIDE AND YOU

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:02.951
KNOW I THINK THEY'LL GET THERE.

01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:03.986
BUT A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:05.654
HAVE OR ISSUES THAT HAVE TO DO

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:07.222
WITH OUR PLANNING ARE PLANNING

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:08.724
FROM A CITY LEVEL BUT AS

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.692
PRIORITIZE AUTOMOBILES OVERALL

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.594
ELSE AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:13.395
MOVES INTO THAT SPACE IS AT

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.364
RISK. BECAUSE THOSE SCOOTERS

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:16.598
SCOOTERS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:18.700
LIGHTER THAN A CAR THE SAME WAY

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:21.837
THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:25.107
PEDESTRIANS KILLED EVERY SINGLE

01:17:25.173 --> 01:17:25.674
DAY ACROSS THE STATE AND TO.

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:29.311
TURN OF THE HIGH. COST. IS

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:29.945
BEING RUN OVER BY CARS BUT WE

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:30.512
DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT. WHEN

01:17:30.579 --> 01:17:31.179
STUDENTS COME WE HAVE. WE JUST

01:17:31.246 --> 01:17:31.780
HEARD. COLLISIONS THAT ARE IN

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:33.081
THE SINGLE DIGITS. AND EVERYONE

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:34.716
TALKS ABOUT HOW DANGEROUS THEY

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:35.951
ARE WELL I'M SORRY I'M A LOT

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:38.020
MORE FREE FOR MY SIX YEAR OLD.

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:39.388
ABOUT HER ENCOUNTERING THE CAR

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:40.856
THEN ENCOUNTERING A SCOOTER SO.

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:42.357
WORRIED ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:43.759
ENGINEERING ISSUES THAT WE

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:44.526
SHOULD DO IN TERMS OF OUR

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:46.528
CITIES TO MAKE OUR ROADS SAFER.

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:48.463
AND MAKE IT SAFER FOR PEOPLE TO

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.198
BE ABLE TO USE- BUT THE MESSAGE

01:17:50.265 --> 01:17:51.166
OF TRANSPORTATION THAT ARE

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:52.801
GOING TO BE YEAH WE CAN DEAL

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:53.835
WITH THE PICKUPS AND MAKE THAT

01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:55.937
GREENER AND ALL OF THAT. BUT WE

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:56.605
NEED TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF CARS

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:58.006
IN OUR CITIES. NEW BOTH KNOW

01:17:58.073 --> 01:17:58.807
THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE FROM CITIES

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:00.742
THAT ARE. IMPACTED BY THAT. BUT

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:01.843
WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR STREETS

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.311
SAFER. AND OUR QUESTION SHOULD

01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:04.112
BE HOW DO WE ENGINEER OUR

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:05.380
STREETS TO MAKE THEM SAFER FOR

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:07.249
MICROBIOLOGY. AND NOT HOW DO WE

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:09.451
MAKE MY CHROME MOBILITY. FIT

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.819
INTO THIS PARADIGM WHERE IT HAS

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:12.287
TO BE THEM VERSUS A CAR. OR

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:14.322
THEM VERSUS A PEDESTRIAN YOU

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:15.657
KNOW THAT'S KIND OF ON US. AS

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:17.759
PEOPLE WHO ENGINEER CITIES. SO

01:18:17.826 --> 01:18:18.927
JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:21.396

FOUNDATION- SO I'M HERE BECAUSE

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:57.138
I'VE SPENT THE LAST TWENTY PLUS

01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:58.807
YEARS OF MY CAREER WORKING ON

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:01.409
MAKING CITIES AND STREETS SAFER

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:04.045
FOR PEOPLE WHO WALK AND BIKE-

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:05.380
AND REALLY NO MATTER HOW THEY

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:07.615
GET AROUND. AND BUT THAT HAS

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:09.718
REMAINED A STUBBORN CHALLENGE-

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:10.719
PARTICULARLY THE CITY OF LOS

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:12.620
ANGELES OVER HALF OF THE TRIPS

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:14.789
THAT HAPPEN IN THE CITY ON THE

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:15.390
SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES OF

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:16.458
STREETS THAT WE MANAGE AND

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:18.893
OPERATE ARE UNDER THREE MILES

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.262
BUT 71% OF THEM ARE PEOPLE

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:22.931
DRIVING THEMSELVES ALONE IN

01:23:22.997 --> 01:23:24.632
THEIR CARS AND SO YOU KNOW WE

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:26.067
MAKE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:28.403
GIVING PEOPLE CHOICES AND IN

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:29.771
TRYING TO CREATE. A DIFFERENT

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:33.608
KIND OF CITY- BUT WHEN SCOOTER

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:35.377
SHOWED UP ON OUR STREETS ALMOST

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:42.317
OVERNIGHT. FOR THE SHORT TRIPS

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:44.319
AND SO WE TOOK IT UNDER IN OUR

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:45.387
INTEREST TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:47.055
THESE COMPANIES COULD SUCCEED

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:49.023
BECAUSE IN THE VERY VERY BEST

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:50.892
VERSION OF THE PUBLIC AND

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:52.861
PRIVATE ROLES- CITIES ARE

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:54.796
MANAGING STREETS AND PRIVATE

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:58.066
OPTIONS AND ARE INNOVATING AND

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:58.767
OUR ITERATING AND ARE

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.835
SUCCEEDING SO WE HAD A SERIES

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:02.470
OF PUBLIC HEARINGS- WE HAD

01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:04.572
COMMITTEE THAT COMMUNITY

01:24:04.639 --> 01:24:05.440
MEETINGS TO COME UP WITH A SET

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:07.976
OF COMMON SENSE REGULATIONS- TO

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:09.744
SORT OF SET THE STAGE ON THE

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:10.779
POSITIVE SIDE WE NOW HAVE THE

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:12.981
LARGEST SCOOTER PROGRAM IN THE

01:24:13.047 --> 01:24:15.016
COUNTRY IF NOT THE WORLD WE

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:16.618
HAVE THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:18.453
SCOOTERS- ON THE STREET OF LOS

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.288
ANGELES WE ARE ON TRACK. TO

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.223
HAVE NINETEEN MILLION TRIPS

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.559
HAPPENED BY SCOOTERS AND BIKES

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:26.628
IN A SINGLE YEAR AND THE

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.196
MAJORITY OF THOSE TRIPS ARE

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:29.831
EXACTLY THE ONES THAT WE WERE

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.499
TRYING TO GIVE PEOPLE CHOICES

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.201
THAT WORK FOR THEIR BETWEEN

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:35.470
HALF A MILE AND TWO MILES OR

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:36.404
TALKING ABOUT NEIGHBORHOOD

01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:38.339
TRIPS WERE TALKING ABOUT TRIPS

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:39.841
TO GO TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOUR

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:41.042
FRIEND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:42.377
TRIPS TO GET TO YOUR HOUSE FROM

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:45.046
THE TRANSIT STATION- ON THE NOT

01:24:45.113 --> 01:24:46.414
SO GREAT SIDE WE WERE SEEING

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:48.416
THAT COMPANIES WERE AKING A

01:24:48.483 --> 01:24:50.118
REALLY LONG TIME TO RESPOND TO

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:51.686
COMMUNITY COMPLAINTS. SOMETIMES

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:53.087
UPWARDS OF TWENTY HOURS TO COME

01:24:53.154 --> 01:24:54.489
AND COLLECT THEIR SCOOTERS WHEN

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:55.657
THEY ENDED UP WHERE THEY

01:24:55.723 --> 01:24:56.724
WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE WHETHER

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:57.258
IT WAS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY

01:24:57.325 --> 01:24:58.593
SENSITIVE AREA LIKE THE VENICE

01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:00.395
CANALS OR REALLY CROWDED

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:02.363
SIDEWALKS- ON THE WEST SIDE OF

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.265
LOS ANGELES WE WERE ALSO SEEING

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.467
THAT THESE COMPANIES WERE NOT

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:07.202
SERVING THE CITY EQUITABLY SO

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:09.304
THEY WERE TARGETING A LOT OF

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:10.839
THE HIGHER INCOME DENSER

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:12.407
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY WHERE

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:13.808
PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:15.043
CHOICES ON HOW TO GET AROUND

01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:16.911
AND THEY WERE NOT GOING TO LOW

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:18.613
INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE SAN

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:19.414
FERNANDO VALLEY IN BOYLE

01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:22.383
HEIGHTS IN WHAT'S PLACES WHERE

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:23.785
PEOPLE DESPERATELY NEED. SERVE

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:25.620
ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION TO

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:26.554
EXPAND THEIR ACCESS TO

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:29.324
OPPORTUNITY- AND WE WERE JUST

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:31.359
SORT OF SEEING THAT- THEY WERE

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:33.528
ENDING UP OVER DEPLOYING IN

01:25:33.595 --> 01:25:36.564
PLACES WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T SO

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:37.465
FOR EXAMPLE IN A ONE SQUARE

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:41.536
MILE AREA IN VENICE THERE WERE

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:42.136
OVER TWO THOUSAND SCOOTERS AND

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:49.110
BIKES. DEPLOYED IN THE SAME

01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:49.944
SORT OF ONE SQUARE MILE AREA.

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:50.578
SO BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO SET

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:51.312
REGULATIONS AND GET INFORMATION

01:25:51.379 --> 01:25:52.280
ABOUT WHERE THE COMPANIES WERE

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:53.314
DEPLOYING WE WERE ABLE TO PUT

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:53.848
WHAT'S CALLED A GEO FENCE

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:55.016
AROUND THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:57.185
MEASURE EXACTLY HOW MUCH SPACE

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.853
THERE WAS ON THE SIDEWALK TO

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.989
SAFELY STORE THE VEHICLES. AND

01:26:01.055 --> 01:26:02.790
THEN GIVE EACH COMPANY AND A

01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:04.826
LOT OF BUDGET FOR THE NUMBER OF

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:05.760
SCOOTERS AND BIKES THAT THEY

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.929
COULD HAVE IN THAT ARENA. AND

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.330
THEN ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WE

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:10.265
WERE ABLE TO SEE WHO WAS

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:11.933
OBEYING THE RULES. AND WHO WAS

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.668
NOT AND IF SOMEBODY WASN'T

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:14.736
OBEYING THE RULES WE WERE ABLE

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:16.337
TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. AND

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:17.906
IN SO DOING WE WERE ABLE TO

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:19.173
BUILD PUBLIC TRUST AND

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.342
CONFIDENCE. THAT THESE KINDS OF

01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:24.112
NEW IDEAS AND NEW CHOICES COULD

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:24.712
COME INTO THE CITY IN A WAY.

01:26:24.779 --> 01:26:27.115
THAT THE CITY CAN HANDLE. SO

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:28.216
THE WAY WE DO THAT IS WE

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:29.517
COLLECT AS LITTLE INFORMATION

01:26:29.584 --> 01:26:31.419
AS POSSIBLE WE ONLY GET ABOUT

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:32.587
SIX PIECES OF DATA FROM THESE

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:34.556
COMPANIES. THE COMPANIES

01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:35.657
THEMSELVES COLLECT OVER TWO

01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:38.159
DOZEN PIECES OF DATA- ABOUT THE

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:39.594
PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THEIR

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:40.762
SYSTEMS AND ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:43.231
GOING AND WHEN AND WHY- WE HAVE

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:44.265
PRIVACY PRINCIPLES THAT WE PUT

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:46.267
FORWARD FOR PUBLIC COMMENT-

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.436
THAT REALLY. PUT US IN A VERY

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:50.838
STERN BOX ON MAKING SURE THAT

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:51.806
WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE'S

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:54.108
INFORMATION. THAT WE ARE NEVER

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.443
MONETIZING ITAND THAT WE'RE

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:57.045
STORING IT FOR A SHORTER PERIOD

01:26:57.111 --> 01:27:00.848
AS POSSIBLE- AND WE'RE DOING IT

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:04.619
TRANSPARENTLY ARE OPEN PLATFORM.

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:05.353
OPERATION WITH MANY OF THE

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:05.954
COMPANIES THAT OPERATE IN LOS

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.021
ANGELES. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:07.755
WHAT WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE IN

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.090
TERMS OF STATEWIDE REGULATION.

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:10.825
THERE IS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:12.260
VACUUM WHEN IT COMES TO

01:27:12.327 --> 01:27:13.695
REGULATING THE VEHICLES

01:27:13.761 --> 01:27:15.697
THEMSELVES. AND WHAT WE SEE IS

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:16.998
COMPANIES DOING A LOT OF

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:19.500
EXPERIMENTATION WITH NEW KINDS

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:21.235
OF VEHICLES. THAT WE'VE NEVER

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:23.237
SEEN BEFORE. AND THEN CITIES

01:27:23.304 --> 01:27:25.940
SORT OF AT A LOSS ABOUT HOW TO

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:26.708
REGULATE THEM OR WHAT

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:29.177
CATEGORIES THEY FALL INTO. THE

01:27:29.243 --> 01:27:30.178
SECOND ARENA THAT WE THINK IS

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:33.147
REALLY. IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:33.748
FOR THE STATE TO REGULATE IS

01:27:33.815 --> 01:27:36.217
AROUND INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS-

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:36.918
WE DO THINK THAT THAT'S

01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:37.919
SOMETHING THAT THE STATE HAS

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.120
TRADITIONALLY DONE AND DONE A

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:41.723
GOOD JOB OF- AND THAT WOULD BE

01:27:41.789 --> 01:27:42.590
GREAT FOR THAT FOR THEM TO

WE ALSO HAVE AN UP WE ARE THE

01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:46.053
COMMUNITY EARNS TO US TO MAKE

SURE THAT WE'RE MAINTAINING

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:47.788
SAFETY IN ORDER IN THE PUBLIC

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:49.957
RIGHT OF WAY. AND THE SCOOTERS

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:51.759
HAVE PROVIDED- WONDERFUL

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.594
MOBILITY OPTION- IN SANTA

01:33:53.661 --> 01:33:55.863
MONICA OR IS WRAPPING UP. A

01:33:55.930 --> 01:34:04.238
PILOT PROGRAM IN. OVER THIRTEEN

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:04.839
MONTHS WE'VE HAD TWO POINT SIX

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:09.243
MILLION TRIPS. A. ON THE FOR

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:10.044
OPERATORS. IN THE CITY THAT'S

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:10.845
INCREDIBLE- IT'S REDUCE A LOT

01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:12.013
OF A COLD STARTS EMISSIONS AND

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:12.613
DEALT WITH SOME REAL.

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:13.280
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES WE HAVE WITH

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:13.914
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET AROUND

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:15.416
TOWN. HOWEVER WE ALSO HAVE

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:16.350
THOUSANDS OF INCIDENTS OF A

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:17.118
SIDEWALK BLOCKAGES AND IT IS

01:34:17.184 --> 01:34:18.586
FUNDAMENTALLY POSSIBLE FOR A

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:20.421
CITY EVEN AS SMALL AS HOURS OF

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:21.822
EIGHT SQUARE MILES. TO BE ON

01:34:21.889 --> 01:34:22.790
EVERY STREET CORNER AT ALL

01:34:22.857 --> 01:34:24.358
TIMES MANAGING THREE THOUSAND

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:25.326
VEHICLES THAT MOVE ALL THE

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:27.395
TIME. IT'S JUST NOT REALISTIC

01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:28.829
FOR US TO BE OUT THERE LOOKING

01:34:28.896 --> 01:34:30.031
FOR THEM COUNTING THEM FINDING

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:31.298
THESE PROBLEMS AND FOR US TO

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:32.633
MAINTAIN ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WITH

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.435
DISABILITIES. WE NEED

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.337
TECHNOLOGY TOOLS AND WE NEED A

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:38.005
TRUE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WITH

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:38.773
THE COMPANIES. TO HOLD THEM

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:40.641
ACCOUNTABLE TO DO THEIR PART.

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:43.177
THESE DEVICES ARE NOT CARS SO

01:34:43.244 --> 01:34:44.311
THEY ARE NOT AS VALUABLE

01:34:44.378 --> 01:34:46.047
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE LEFT.

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:50.284
THROWN DESTROYED. VANDALIZED

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:52.386
AND SO WE NEED. UP TRUE

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:54.155
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL

01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:55.489
JURISDICTIONS AND THE COMPANIES

01:34:55.556 --> 01:34:56.991
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE- THAT

01:34:57.058 --> 01:34:58.626
THEY'RE DOING THEIR PART TO

01:34:58.692 --> 01:34:59.927
MAKE SURE THAT THEIR ASSETS ARE

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:01.796
BEING MAINTAINED. AND ALSO

01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:02.430
DEALT WITH IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:03.764
AWAY SO I WANT TO JUST

01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:04.632
UNDERSCORE THAT IS A IS A

01:35:04.698 --> 01:35:07.001
REALLY FUNDAMENTAL TO THIS-

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:08.836
ROLE THAT WE ALL. THAT WE ALL

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:11.138
PLAY- I ALSO WANT TO. SAY THAT

01:35:11.205 --> 01:35:13.040
YOU KNOW IS THE CITY WE CONVENE

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:14.008
FOURTEEN LEADING CITIES FROM

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:16.210
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LAST MONTH

01:35:16.277 --> 01:35:17.445
TO SURVEY BEST PRACTICES. AS

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:19.413
WE'RE EMBARKING ON OUR NEXT

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.748
PILOT PROGRAM AND IT'S QUITE

01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:22.516
TRUE THAT THERE ARE SOME BEST

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:24.618
PRACTICES BUT THERE'S NO

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:26.053
DOMINANT MODEL AT THIS POINT.

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:26.687
AND GIVEN THAT THE INDUSTRY IS

01:35:26.754 --> 01:35:28.722
NOT YET. DEMONSTRATING A-

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:29.924
FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY. THEY

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.658
NEED TO MAKE CHANGES TO MEET

01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:32.359
THEIR BOTTOM LINE JUST LIKE

01:35:32.426 --> 01:35:34.295
CITIES HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES TO

01:35:34.361 --> 01:35:34.962
MEET OUR MINIMUM SAFETY

01:35:35.029 --> 01:35:36.664
REQUIREMENTS SO WE EXPECT THAT

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:38.265
THAT COME. WILL NEED TO CHANGE

01:35:38.332 --> 01:35:42.403
AND THAT'S OKAY- NOBODY'S LOOK

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:45.639
MUCH BEYOND EIGHT. TO TWENTY

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:46.974
FOUR MONTHS AT THIS POINT FROM

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:48.742
A REGULATORY STANDPOINT BECAUSE

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:51.712
WE'VE NO. THIS WILL CHANGE

01:35:51.779 --> 01:35:52.947
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE DOING

01:35:53.013 --> 01:35:53.581
SECOND THIRD PILOT PROGRAM THIS

01:35:53.647 --> 01:36:01.856

THAT'S THE NET THAT'S TRUE THE

01:36:05.059 --> 01:36:05.860
STE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:36:05.926 --> 01:36:06.494
RECOGNIZE THAT MAILING THINGS

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:07.061
DOWN TOO SOON WOULD ACTUALLY

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:07.695
TAKE A WAVE FOR THE ABILITY FOR

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:08.429
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO HAVE

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:08.996

01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:11.132
SOLVE. SO WITHOUT REPEATING

01:36:11.198 --> 01:36:12.533
ANYTHING OTHERS IS SET ON

01:39:24.858 --> 01:39:26.293
ARE. ARISING WE DON'T WANT TO

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.295
BE HAVE TO TAKE AWAY. FROM OUR

01:39:28.362 --> 01:39:29.296
WORK ON COMPLETE STREETS FROM

01:39:29.363 --> 01:39:31.165
OUR TRAFFIC SAFETY WORK. IS

01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:32.666
REALLY SHOULD THE IMPACT TO THE

01:39:32.733 --> 01:39:33.734
CITY SHOULD BE COST RECOVERY

01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:35.336
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US.

01:39:35.402 --> 01:39:37.471
WE CREATED A CITATION FOR

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:38.972
WALKING PAST A TRAVEL JUST LIKE

01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:39.840
IF YOU HAVE A RIGHT RENTAL CAR

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:41.375

01:39:41.442 --> 01:39:42.976
YOU GET A CITATION TO THE

01:39:43.043 --> 01:39:44.244
COMPANY WITH A COMPANY CHOOSES

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:45.846
TO DO WITH IT IS UP TO THEM-

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:47.181
WE'VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES FOR

01:39:47.247 --> 01:39:47.948
THEIR SOFTWARE BUT THIS MONTH

01:39:49.783 --> 01:39:51.185
COMPANIES WHOSE DEVICES ARE

01:39:51.251 --> 01:39:52.052
WALKING THE SIDEWALKS.

01:39:52.119 --> 01:39:54.121
COMPANIES CAN I CHOOSE TO PASS

IT ON TO THE USER IF THEY WANT.

01:39:55.122 --> 01:39:56.056
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHO THAT USER

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:57.991
IT AS- WE REQUIRE AT LITTLE

01:39:58.058 --> 01:39:59.326
DISTRIBUTION AND ACCESS IS

01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:00.627
REALLY KEY AGAIN I THINK IT'S

01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:02.363
ALREADY BEEN SAID- WELL THIS S

01:40:02.429 --> 01:40:03.897
NOT A CITY PROGRAM WE TREAT

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:05.399
THIS LIKE. A COFFEE SHOP WE

01:40:05.466 --> 01:40:06.967
DON'T REGULATE HOW MANY COFFEE

01:40:07.034 --> 01:40:08.402
SHOPS. CAN OPERATE IN THE CITY

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:09.570
OR HOW MANY COMPANIES CAN A

01:40:09.636 --> 01:40:10.804
COFFEE SHOP COMPANIES CAN

01:40:10.871 --> 01:40:12.239
OPERATE IN THE CITY. WE DO

01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:12.906
THINK WE HAVE A MORAL

01:40:12.973 --> 01:40:14.274
OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THESE

01:40:14.341 --> 01:40:15.976
DEVICES WHICH ALL ASPECTS OF

01:40:16.043 --> 01:40:18.345
OUR CITY. THE 20% OF THEIR

01:40:18.412 --> 01:40:19.079
DEVICES MUST THOSE WHO ARE

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:20.848
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE

01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:22.683
WERE FEE STRUCTURE THE PIECE

01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:23.384
FOR THE PARKING SO WE REQUIRE

01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:25.018
THAT THEY BE A BIKE RACKS IT IS

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:25.853
NAY DROP ZONES WE COLLECT A

01:40:25.919 --> 01:40:27.821
SMALL FEE OF TEN CENTS PER

01:40:27.888 --> 01:40:29.056
TRIP. TO PAY FOR THE PARKING

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:34.795
SPACES- AND LASTLY. WE'RE USING

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:35.396
THE DATA WERE COLLECTED A GOOD

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:40.634
AMOUNT OF DATA. AND I GET THAT-

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:41.101
TO DO MAKE DATA DRIVEN

01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:42.603
DECISIONS. WE WANT TO KNOW

01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:43.837
WHERE THE- TRIPS ARE ENDING. SO

01:40:43.904 --> 01:40:44.338
THAT WE CAN PUT IN BIKE

01:40:44.405 --> 01:40:46.173
PARKING. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.641
OUR MPO SAY KAGU ROLLED. OUT

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:49.343
OUR PICTURE PROGRAM LAST YEAR.

01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:50.878
AND ON THE BIKE PARKING MAYBE

01:40:50.944 --> 01:40:52.479
WASN'T PUT IN ALWAYS THE BEST

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:53.480
PLACES THEY WERE HAVING SOME

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:55.749
UNDER UTILIZE- BIKE PARKING.

01:40:55.816 --> 01:40:56.483
BUT NOW WE'RE MAKING BETTER

01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:58.152
DECISIONS USING THE DATA THAT

01:40:58.218 --> 01:40:59.186
WE COLLECT THROUGH THE SEVENTY

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:00.521
S. PROCESS TO PUT IN THE

01:41:00.587 --> 01:41:01.722
PARKING THAT IS NEEDED. AND

01:41:01.789 --> 01:41:03.223
IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE IS

01:41:03.290 --> 01:41:04.591
MAGICAL YOU PUT IN THE RACKS

01:41:04.658 --> 01:41:06.059
AND- THE DEVICES ALONG THE

01:41:06.126 --> 01:41:07.428
BLOCK ALL GRAVITATE TO THAT

01:41:07.494 --> 01:41:09.863
PARKING IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE-

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:11.865
PROCESS THAT WE HAD- SO THIS IS

01:41:11.932 --> 01:41:13.200
A DE OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE'VE

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:14.168
BEEN DOING IN THE DATA WERE

01:41:14.234 --> 01:41:15.002
COLLECTING I NEVER GOING TO

01:41:15.068 --> 01:41:17.004
HAVE ANOTHER. HEARING ON THE

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:17.905
DATA SO WE CAN GO INTO THAT A

01:41:17.971 --> 01:41:19.406
LITTLE BIT MORE- SERVER THE

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:20.040
CITY SACRAMENTO WHEN I THOUGHT

01:41:20.107 --> 01:41:22.042
EVERYBODY ELSE'S ALREADY SAID-

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:23.243
BUT THIS IS REALLY INVOLVING

01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:24.645
FEELS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:41:24.711 --> 01:41:26.146
BE RESPONSIVE AND QUICK THIS IS

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:27.347
ACTUALLY THE SECOND SET OF

01:41:27.414 --> 01:41:28.515
ITERATIONS OF REGULATORY.

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:29.149
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT WE'VE

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:30.984
HAD. WE CAN MOVE QUICKLY THE

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:32.085
CITY TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES THAT

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:34.521

HERE. AND SO WE WANT TO AVOID

01:41:40.694 --> 01:41:42.963
COST TO THE WORK THAT WE DO-

HEY WE WANT ACCESS TO DATA I

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:45.432
THINK IT'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAR SO

01:41:45.499 --> 01:41:47.000
THAT WE CAN MAKE DATABASES

01:41:47.067 --> 01:41:47.734
ASIAN SO WE WANT TO RESPOND TO

01:41:47.801 --> 01:41:50.037

THESE THE CREEKS- THAT HAVE

01:50:02.395 --> 01:50:05.231
EXPERIENCES ARE OFTEN. ALONG

VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATIONS

01:50:43.103 --> 01:50:45.972
FROM ALL THE CITIES LIKE WAS

01:50:46.039 --> 01:50:47.407
FINDING MYSELF AGREEING WITH SO

01:50:47.474 --> 01:50:48.775
MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT

01:50:48.842 --> 01:50:50.477
IT WAS LIKE MUSIC TWO YEARS IN

01:50:50.543 --> 01:50:52.178
TERMS OF SPECIALLY YOUR FOR

01:50:52.245 --> 01:50:54.647
YOUR FIRST POINT TO- IT'S- BONE

01:50:54.714 --> 01:50:58.618
ON THE ISSUE OF INSURANCE. THAT

01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:00.854
I HEARD BOTH LOS ANGELES SAN

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:05.325
FRANCISCO AGREE- THAT- THIS IS

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:09.029
AN AREA THAT THE STATE SHOULD-

01:51:09.095 --> 01:51:13.066
ESTABLISHED MINIMUM INSURANCE-REQUIREMENTS THE A TO- ADDRESS

01:51:13.133 --> 01:51:16.036
SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES. ARE

01:51:16.102 --> 01:51:16.636
ARE THERE ANY CITIES THAT THEY

01:51:16.703 --> 01:51:19.239
WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT. NO

01:51:19.305 --> 01:51:22.675
OKAY- IN AND JUST FOR REFERENCE

01:51:22.742 --> 01:51:25.745
LOS ANGELES COULD YOU SHARE. DO

01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:27.547
YOU HAVE WHAT ARE YOUR CURRENT

01:51:27.614 --> 01:51:28.548
A MINIMUM INSURANCE

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:31.351
REQUIREMENTS SO WE HAVE A FIVE

01:51:31.418 --> 01:51:32.986
MILLION DOLLAR UMBRELLA

01:51:33.053 --> 01:51:36.856
REQUIREMENT AND- I BELIEVE IT'S

01:51:36.923 --> 01:51:37.357
ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:41.161
INCIDENT. YEP WE CAN SHARE THE

01:51:41.227 --> 01:51:42.829
DETAILS OF THEM WHAT WE'VE

01:51:42.896 --> 01:51:44.931
HEARD SO THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:51:44.998 --> 01:51:45.465
REASONS WHY I THINK IT'S

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:46.666
IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE'S SENT

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:48.435
A SIGNAL WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS

01:51:48.501 --> 01:51:50.437
THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE INSURER

01:51:50.503 --> 01:51:51.971
IN THE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD

01:51:52.038 --> 01:51:53.339
LLOYDS OF LONDON THAT WILL EVEN

01:51:53.406 --> 01:51:55.875
RIGHT. THE COVERAGE AND WHAT

01:51:55.942 --> 01:51:57.110
THAT MEANS IS THAT IT'S VERY

01:51:57.177 --> 01:51:59.012
EXPENSIVE AND WHAT THAT MEANS

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:00.747
IS THAT THERE'S A BARRIER TO

01:52:00.814 --> 01:52:02.282
ENTRY TO SMALLER START UPS

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:04.484
WHICH ARE PREDOMINANTLY OWNED

01:52:04.551 --> 01:52:06.920
BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR

01:52:06.986 --> 01:52:09.422
AND SO I THINK IF THE STATE

01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:10.590
SENDS A SIGNAL THAT THIS IS A

01:52:10.657 --> 01:52:12.692
NEW INSURANCE MARKET. MY HOPE

01:52:12.759 --> 01:52:13.693
WOULD BE THAT THERE WOULD BE

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.628
MORE UNDERWRITERS WILLING TO

01:52:15.695 --> 01:52:17.564
OFFER THIS KIND OF INSURANCE

01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:19.632
AND ELIMINATE THAT BARRIER TO

01:52:19.699 --> 01:52:20.233
ENTRY FOR SMALLER COMPANIES. A

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:24.137
RIGHT. AND I ALSO WANT TO ASK

01:52:24.204 --> 01:52:26.039
SANTA MONICA WITH A WAY WHAT IS

01:52:26.106 --> 01:52:29.709
YOUR INSURANCE REQUIREMENT. I'M

01:52:29.776 --> 01:52:32.112
WE HAVE A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

01:52:32.178 --> 01:52:32.645
INCIDENT WITH NO AGGREGATE

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:40.620
MAXIMUM. AND THEN MISTER.

01:52:40.687 --> 01:52:43.123
MCGUIRE FROM SAM CISCO YOU

01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:45.525
EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT- THAT

01:52:45.592 --> 01:52:47.760
LOCAL LOCAL- REGULATIONS OR

01:52:47.827 --> 01:52:49.028
LOCAL NEEDS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:51.030
BY LOCAL REGULATIONS AND THAT

01:52:51.097 --> 01:52:52.065
YOU ARE DEFINITELY AGAINST A

01:52:52.132 --> 01:52:54.734
ONE SIZE FITS ALL. APPROACH

01:52:54.801 --> 01:52:57.804
FROM SACRAMENTO IS THAT CORRECT.

01:52:57.871 --> 01:52:59.506
ALL RIGHT IN AND I HEARD A

01:52:59.572 --> 01:53:00.707
SIMILAR SENTIMENT FROM SAN

01:53:00.773 --> 01:53:03.476
JOSE- THAT- THAT OFTENTIMES

01:53:03.543 --> 01:53:06.913
EVEN A- THINGS CAN CHANGE FROM

01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:07.480
STREET BY STREET OR

01:53:07.547 --> 01:53:09.082
NEIGHBORHOOD BY NEIGHBORHOOD

01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:11.217
CORRECT. AND SO THAT WOULD-

01:53:11.284 --> 01:53:14.053
ARGUE IN FAVOR OF A CITIES

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:16.256
BEING ABLE TO TAILOR- YOUR

01:53:16.322 --> 01:53:18.958
SAFETY RULES FOR THE UNIQUE

01:53:19.025 --> 01:53:20.693
CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR YOUR

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.128
STREETS. AND ALL CITIES WOULD

01:53:22.195 --> 01:53:23.863
AGREE WITH THAT EVEN IN A SMALL

01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:25.331
CITY THE SIZE OF SANTA MONICA

01:53:25.398 --> 01:53:27.066
WE HAVE NATIONAL DESTINATIONS

01:53:27.133 --> 01:53:28.301
WITH APPEAR IN THE PROM AND

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:30.136
ODD- BUT WE HAVE REGULAR

01:53:30.203 --> 01:53:30.737
NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE EVERYONE

01:53:30.803 --> 01:53:32.772
ELSE SO EVEN IN A SMALL CITY

01:53:32.839 --> 01:53:35.241
YOU NEED A VERY WIDE VARIETY OF

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:36.809
LOCAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE

01:53:36.876 --> 01:53:38.978
SAFETY. ALL RIGHT WE JUST OFFER

01:53:39.045 --> 01:53:39.846
ONE ADDITIONAL SORT OF POINT TO

01:53:39.913 --> 01:53:41.648
THAT WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW LOS

01:53:41.714 --> 01:53:43.449
ANGELES IS LARGE ENOUGH THAT WE

01:53:43.516 --> 01:53:45.151
HAVE CITIES INSIDE OUR CITY

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:48.054
AND- BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE

01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:50.623
CITIES HAVE PUT IN- EXTREMELY

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:52.091
RESTRICTIVE PROGRAMS ARE

01:53:52.158 --> 01:53:53.927
OUTRIGHT BANS WHAT WE

01:53:53.993 --> 01:53:56.129
EXPERIENCE IS ALL OF THE

01:53:56.196 --> 01:53:57.797
SCOOTERS ENDING UP CLUSTERED

01:53:57.864 --> 01:53:59.265
RIGHT AROUND THE BOUNDARY OF

01:53:59.332 --> 01:54:00.833
THOSE CITIES AND SO THEY END UP

01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:01.968
BEING AND AN ISSUE FOR LOS

01:54:02.035 --> 01:54:04.370
ANGELES. I DO THINK THAT THERE

01:54:04.437 --> 01:54:07.040
IS A ROLE FOR THE STATE TO

01:54:07.106 --> 01:54:09.442
ALLOW PASSAGE AT LEAST THROUGH

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:10.743
CITIES AND SET SOME CLARITY

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:12.912
AROUND THAT BECAUSE EVERY

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:14.981
COMPANY IS TREATING THOSE BANDS

01:54:15.048 --> 01:54:16.683
IN A DIFFERENT WAY SOME OF THEM

01:54:16.749 --> 01:54:17.984
WON'T EVEN LET YOU BRING THIS

01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:20.186
GOOD OR INTO THE CITIES. OTHERS

01:54:20.253 --> 01:54:21.788
pNOT STOP OTHERS WILL LET YOU

01:54:21.854 --> 01:54:22.989
BRING IT IN BUT GO SLOW THAT

01:54:23.056 --> 01:54:26.960
FEELS LIKE AN AREA WHERE SOME

01:54:27.026 --> 01:54:27.527
KIND OF REGIONAL APPROACH IS

01:54:27.594 --> 01:54:31.130
REALLY REQUIRED. ALRIGHT I

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:34.334
APPRECIATE THAT AND- ONE LAST

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:35.768
QUESTION FOR NOW HAVE ANY OF

01:54:35.835 --> 01:54:37.003
THE CITY'S REPRESENTED ON THIS

01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:39.472
PANEL ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF.

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:47.247
AND MANY OF THESE. MOBILITY.

01:54:47.313 --> 01:54:50.650
PROVIDERS REQUIRE A WAIVERS OF

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:51.985
LEGAL RIGHTS WHEN THEY WHEN

01:54:52.051 --> 01:54:54.387
THEY SIGN UP FOR THE SERVICES

01:54:54.454 --> 01:54:54.954
HAVE HAVE ANY OF YOU ADDRESS

01:54:55.021 --> 01:54:57.957
THIS ISSUE. OKAY ALL RIGHT

01:54:58.024 --> 01:54:59.726
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:54:59.792 --> 01:55:03.896
ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. JUST A

01:55:03.963 --> 01:55:05.131
COUPLE OF THINGS I'M CURIOUS

01:55:05.198 --> 01:55:07.700
ABOUT OF ANY YOU AN ANSWER SO I

01:55:07.767 --> 01:55:09.369
COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THIS BUT

01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:11.337
SO I KNOW WE JUST HEARD THAT

01:55:11.404 --> 01:55:13.506
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T ALLOW-

01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:14.907
SCREWS RE WRITTEN ON SIDEWALKS

01:55:14.974 --> 01:55:16.909
A STATEWIDE BUT AS FAR AS I

01:55:16.976 --> 01:55:18.278
KNOW BICYCLES CAN BE WRITEN

01:55:18.344 --> 01:55:19.812
INSIDE WALKS IN A LOT OF CITIES

01:55:19.879 --> 01:55:21.914
IN CERTAIN PLACES SO IS THAT

01:55:21.981 --> 01:55:22.915
ONE OF THOSE LAWS THAT YOU WISH

01:55:22.982 --> 01:55:26.185
YOU HAD THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE

01:55:26.252 --> 01:55:28.221
CONTROL OVER WHERE AND- WITH

01:55:28.288 --> 01:55:32.091
THE WEATHER SCOOTERS COULD BE

01:55:32.158 --> 01:55:32.725
ALLOWED INSIDE WALKS IN CERTAIN

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:35.995
PLACES AT CERTAIN TIMES.

01:55:36.062 --> 01:55:36.462
BECAUSE I MUCH SORT OF

01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:37.363
WONDERING. BICYCLES CAN GO A

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.964
LOT FASTER THAN FIFTEEN MILES

01:55:38.031 --> 01:55:40.366
AN HOUR- SO WHY HAVE WE TREATED

01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:40.967
THE SCOOTERS DIFFERENTLY THAN

01:55:41.034 --> 01:55:43.136
BICYCLES. IT'S A GREAT

01:55:43.202 --> 01:55:45.204
QUESTION- AGAIN JENNIFER CITIES

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:47.140
SACRAMENTO IT'S VERY CONFUSING

01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:48.207
FOR OUR ACTUAL RESIDENTS OF THE

01:55:48.274 --> 01:55:49.475
CITY SACRAMENTO IS ALLOWED

01:55:49.542 --> 01:55:50.643
BIKING ON SIDEWALKS EVERYWHERE

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:52.245
EXCEPT WHERE WE PERMIT. HAVE

01:55:52.312 --> 01:55:54.080
PROHIBITED AND WE HAVEN'T WE

01:55:54.147 --> 01:55:55.248
NEED TO HAVE WHAT WE CALL LOW

01:55:55.315 --> 01:55:57.684
STRESS BIKE WAY ADJACENT TO

01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:59.319
PROHIBIT SIDEWALK WRITING. AND

01:55:59.385 --> 01:55:59.952
THAT INCLUDES ELECTRIC ASSIST

01:56:00.019 --> 01:56:01.087
BICYCLE SO WE HAVE JOHN BIKE

01:56:01.154 --> 01:56:03.389
SHARE HERE- WHICH IS ALLWED TO

01:56:03.456 --> 01:56:05.224
USE THE CITY SIDEWALKS-

01:56:05.291 --> 01:56:07.593
HOWEVER- IT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:09.996
TO SCOOT ON SIDEWALKS- SO IN.

01:56:10.063 --> 01:56:11.497
THE STATE IS SAID YOU CAN

01:56:11.564 --> 01:56:13.499
CITIES. DANTE BICYCLES YOU CAN

01:56:13.566 --> 01:56:15.268
REGULATE THE MEASURE WISH BUT

01:56:15.335 --> 01:56:16.736
FOR SCOOTERS YOU CAN'T AND SO

01:56:16.803 --> 01:56:17.837
IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR A

01:56:17.904 --> 01:56:18.838
POLICE DEPARTMENT WE'VE BEEN

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:19.272
GOING OUT DOING OUR

01:56:19.339 --> 01:56:21.007
ENFORCEMENT. THAT IT IS AND

01:56:21.074 --> 01:56:22.575
DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO THE USER

01:56:22.642 --> 01:56:24.077
EVEN THOUGH WE REQUIRE THAT

01:56:24.143 --> 01:56:25.044
THERE BE STICKERS ON THEIR ON

01:56:25.111 --> 01:56:26.512
THE CERES IS A NO SCOOTING ON

01:56:26.579 --> 01:56:28.915
SIDEWALKS- WHO'S LOOKING AT ALL

01:56:28.981 --> 01:56:30.183
THE TAXES ON A SCOOTER THEY'RE

01:56:30.249 --> 01:56:31.584
NOT. I SO I THINK THE CITY

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:35.655
SACRAMENTO'S. RESPECTIVELY

01:56:35.722 --> 01:56:36.222
WOULD LIKE THE AUTHORITY TO

01:56:36.289 --> 01:56:39.592
MAKE THAT DECISION OURSELVES.

01:56:39.659 --> 01:56:40.360
YEAH AND THE OTHER THING IS

01:56:40.426 --> 01:56:40.993
THERE ARE CERTAINLY TIMES WHERE

01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:41.594
SOMEONE'S ON A SCOOTER THERE

01:56:41.661 --> 01:56:42.595
COULD BE MOMENTS WHERE. THERE

01:56:42.662 --> 01:56:43.463
REALLY UNSAFE ON THE STREET.

01:56:43.529 --> 01:56:44.464
AND WE'VE TAKEN THE ABILITY FOR

01:56:44.530 --> 01:56:45.231
THOSE PEOPLE AT THOSE MOMENTS

01:56:45.298 --> 01:56:47.333
TO MAKE THAT VALUE CALL. AND

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:47.934
WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE TO PUT

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:48.968
THEMSELVES IN DANGER AND I

01:56:49.035 --> 01:56:50.603
DON'T UNDERSTAND- MORE WE DON'T

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:51.804
DO THAT FOR BIKES ARE YOU BIKES

01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:53.373
WHICH YOU KNOW HAVE A LOT MORE

01:56:53.439 --> 01:56:55.074
POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGE THAN A

01:56:55.141 --> 01:56:55.575
SCOOTER SO I THINK IT'S

01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:56.442
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD TAKE

01:56:56.509 --> 01:56:58.111
ANOTHER LOOK AT- AND HAVING

01:56:58.177 --> 01:56:59.612
SOME KIND OF PARITY. WITH THESE

01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:01.981
OTHER. MODES OF TRANSPORTATION

01:57:02.048 --> 01:57:02.949
SEEMS TO BE VERY PUNITIVE

01:57:03.015 --> 01:57:04.817
SOMETHING'S VERY ARBITRARY JUST

01:57:04.884 --> 01:57:05.385
FOR SCOOTERS AND NOT FOR YOU

01:57:05.451 --> 01:57:06.953
BIKES OR OTHER. TYPES OF THINGS

01:57:07.019 --> 01:57:08.521
AND AAIN. HAMPERING THEIR

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:09.922
ABILITY TO REGULATE. I DO HAVE

01:57:09.989 --> 01:57:12.458
A QUESTION FOR SACRAMENTO. AND

01:57:12.525 --> 01:57:13.092
I'M JUST CURIOUS ON TAKE IT AS

01:57:13.159 --> 01:57:16.729
A CRITICISM- SO. THE IDEA THAT

01:57:16.796 --> 01:57:17.797
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THESE PLACES

01:57:17.864 --> 01:57:19.999
WERE YOU DOCK YOUR SCOOTERS. I

01:57:20.066 --> 01:57:20.900
MAKE SENSE IN THE GROUP YOU

01:57:20.967 --> 01:57:22.201
KNOW IN MID TOWN WITH THERE'S-

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:23.636
A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT WHAT IF

01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:25.138
WHEN YOU GET OUT TO THE SUBURBS

01:57:25.204 --> 01:57:26.239
I MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT MANY

01:57:26.305 --> 01:57:28.541
OF THESE DOCKS SO. HOW FAR THAT

01:57:28.608 --> 01:57:29.275
ARE YOU TELLING PEOPLE THEY

01:57:29.342 --> 01:57:30.943
HAVE TO EITHER WALK OR TAKEN

01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:32.111
UBER TOO SO YOU EXPECTING

01:57:32.178 --> 01:57:34.614
PEOPLE TO THEN. EITHER WALK A

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:35.648
MILE COUPLE MILES OR TO CALL

01:57:35.715 --> 01:57:37.617
AND UBER WHEN THEY GET TO. A

01:57:37.683 --> 01:57:39.352
PLACE WHERE THERE'S NOT A LOT

01:57:39.419 --> 01:57:39.986
OF THESE DOCKS I'M JUST CURIOUS

01:57:40.052 --> 01:57:41.354
WHAT THE THINKING IS WITH THAT.

01:57:41.421 --> 01:57:42.755
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T

01:57:42.822 --> 01:57:44.357
LIKE THESE WHERE AND THEY CAN

01:57:44.424 --> 01:57:46.692
CAUSE A PROBLEM. BUT AREN'T YOU

01:57:46.759 --> 01:57:48.928
ALSO LIMITING THE USE OF THESE

01:57:48.995 --> 01:57:52.031
IN YOUR SUBURBAN AREAS. IT'S

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:54.500
GREAT QUESTIONING THE CHALLENGE

01:57:54.567 --> 01:57:56.869
THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH

01:57:56.936 --> 01:58:00.239
RIGHT NOW. I'M SO WE REQUIRE

01:58:00.306 --> 01:58:07.079
THAT THE SHARED RIVALS. BY CAR

01:58:07.146 --> 01:58:08.948
OR DROP ZONE WHICH IS. AREA

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:10.082
WHICH WORKS WELL IN THE- CITY

01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:11.050
OF MIDTOWN EVEN JUST OFF THE

01:58:11.117 --> 01:58:11.684
GREAT THE SECOND. PLAN PARKERS

01:58:11.751 --> 01:58:12.685
PARK IN THOSE AREAS. IT DOES

01:58:12.752 --> 01:58:13.186
NOT WORK WELL IN A MORE

01:58:13.252 --> 01:58:14.187
SUBURBAN AREAS IF YOU'RE

01:58:14.253 --> 01:58:14.821
THINKING IN THE CLINTON HEIGHTS

01:58:14.887 --> 01:58:15.888
NEIGHBORHOODS OUTSIDE- TO PASS

01:58:15.955 --> 01:58:16.556
A HIGH IT'S UP TO THE NORTH. SO

01:58:16.622 --> 01:58:17.490
WE ARE LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS

01:58:17.557 --> 01:58:18.524
THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS CAN WE

01:58:18.591 --> 01:58:19.158
TREAT THEM THIS IS WHAT I WANT

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:19.759
THE FLEXIBILITY. CAN WE TREAT

01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:20.426
THEM LIKE A MOTORCYCLE OR MOPED

01:58:20.493 --> 01:58:21.060
AND WHERE THEY CAN PARK IN THE

01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:22.228
PARKING ONLY PERPENDICULAR TO

01:58:22.295 --> 01:58:23.463
THE CURB IN A SUBURBAN AREAS

01:58:23.529 --> 01:58:24.964
WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A LANDSCAPE

01:58:25.031 --> 01:58:26.132
SHOULD BE A PARKING LEAN. A

01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:27.099
FOUR FOOT SIDEWALK IN SOMEONE'S

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:29.836
FRONT YARD- SO COULD WE DO THAT

01:58:29.902 --> 01:58:30.436
SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT

01:58:30.503 --> 01:58:31.070
WE'RE LOOKING INTO TRYING TO

01:58:31.137 --> 01:58:32.672
GET REALLY CREATIVE ABOUT IT SO

01:58:32.738 --> 01:58:34.140
WE'RE NOT PENALIZING RIGHT NOW

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:35.808
ALSO IF YOU. SCOOT HOMER BIKE

01:58:35.875 --> 01:58:37.844
HOME WHEN YOU. PARKED ON THE

01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:38.978
STREET IN FRONT OFYOUR HOUSE

01:58:39.045 --> 01:58:40.680
YOU WILL NOT HAVE A PENALTY.

01:58:40.746 --> 01:58:42.515
BUT IF YOU BLOCK THAT SIDEWALK

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:43.416
YOU CAN AND PROBABLY SHOULD

01:58:43.483 --> 01:58:45.151
RECEIVE A PENALTY WE HAVE A- A

01:58:45.218 --> 01:58:46.853
RESIDENT WHO HAS A CHILD WITH

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:48.955
A- DISABILITY IS TO LISTEN TO

01:58:49.021 --> 01:58:49.589
SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL AREA.

01:58:49.655 --> 01:58:51.157
WITH NO LANDSCAPE STRIP. THE AS

01:58:51.224 --> 01:58:52.859
NEIGHBORS WHO ARE USING THE

01:58:52.925 --> 01:58:54.327
SIDEWALKS AS PARKING FOR THE

01:58:54.393 --> 01:58:55.695
BIKES AND SCOOTERS. WHICH MEANS

01:58:55.761 --> 01:58:57.129
THAT HIS SON CAN'T TRAVEL HIS

01:58:57.196 --> 01:58:58.097
OWN NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS

01:58:58.164 --> 01:58:58.764
SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY WANT

01:58:58.831 --> 01:59:00.766
TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY. WE WANT

01:59:00.833 --> 01:59:01.868
THAT PERSON TO HAVE ACCESS TO

01:59:01.934 --> 01:59:02.535
MOBILITY THROUGHOUT HIS

01:59:02.602 --> 01:59:03.903
NEIGHBORHOOD. I'M GLAD THAT

01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:05.705
YOU'RE- THINKING ABOUT THIS AND

01:59:05.771 --> 01:59:06.873
BRING THESE. CREATIVE

01:59:06.939 --> 01:59:11.244
SOLUTIONS- MY LAST QUESTION.

01:59:11.310 --> 01:59:13.179
WHAT WAS MY- SO IN TERMS OF THE

01:59:13.246 --> 01:59:14.113
SCOOTERS BEING THROWN INTO THE

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:16.949
WATER AND- INTO THE BAY AND THE

01:59:17.016 --> 01:59:17.683
RIVERS AND ALL THAT YOU KNOW

01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:19.051
MAYBE A LITTLE SCOOTER HATE

01:59:19.118 --> 01:59:21.187
GOING ON- SOMETHING HAPPENING

01:59:21.254 --> 01:59:23.556
THERE. DO ANY OF YOU. SORT OF

01:59:23.623 --> 01:59:25.458
CHARGE THE SCOOTER COMPANIES OR

01:59:25.525 --> 01:59:26.692
DO YOU HAVE A FUND THAT THEY

01:59:26.759 --> 01:59:27.927
HAVE TO PAY INTO TO DEAL WITH

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:30.129
THIS SORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL.

01:59:30.196 --> 01:59:36.536
PROBLEM THAT THESE CREATE.

01:59:36.602 --> 01:59:37.136
SOMETIMES OF HAVE YOU THOUGHT

01:59:37.203 --> 01:59:43.109
ABOUT DOING THAT. TAKE YOUR

01:59:43.175 --> 01:59:43.943
ENVIRONMENTAL FINE NO YOU KNOW

01:59:44.010 --> 01:59:44.544
IT IF THE SCOOTERS ARE LEFT

01:59:44.610 --> 01:59:45.144
UNATTENDED AND AN ADDRESS FOR

01:59:45.211 --> 01:59:45.711
MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS

01:59:45.778 --> 01:59:46.779
THEY WOULD BE FINED A HUNDRED

01:59:46.846 --> 01:59:47.346
DOLLARS PER DEVICE FOR EACH

01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:48.915
VIOLATION BUT THERE'S KNOWS.

01:59:48.981 --> 01:59:49.515
KILLER ENVIRONMENT TO FIND TO

01:59:49.582 --> 01:59:52.051
ADDRESS KIND OF THAT MEDICATION.

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:52.585
SIMILARLY WE DON'T HAVE A

01:59:52.652 --> 01:59:54.186
SPECIFIC FOR FUND FOR THAT ONE

01:59:54.253 --> 01:59:56.522
OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT. THE

01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:57.557
DEVICES ACTUALLY DO GO OUT OF

01:59:57.623 --> 01:59:59.158
COMMUNICATION ACTUALLY A LOT

01:59:59.225 --> 02:00:00.059
MORE QUICKLY THAN YOU MIGHT

02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:02.595
THINK AS WELL. SO YOU KNOW OUR

02:00:02.662 --> 02:00:03.963
OUR APPROACH IS A CITY WOULD BE

02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:05.998
TO CON I FOR WHERE THE DEVICES

02:00:06.065 --> 02:00:07.700
IS AND THAT KIND OF POSITION.

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:08.701
TO RIP RECALL TO TELL THE

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:10.169
COMPANIES AND SAY YOU KNOW

02:00:10.236 --> 02:00:13.606
WITHIN REASON A LOT OF TIME YOU-HAVE TO REMEDY THE SITUATION-

02:00:13.673 --> 02:00:15.908
AND LEAVE IT AT THAT. HOWEVER

02:00:15.975 --> 02:00:17.443
THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS JUST

02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:18.578
WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE NUMBER

02:00:18.644 --> 02:00:19.845
OF THEM THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

02:00:19.912 --> 02:00:21.447
OUR IS THERE IN THE PACIFIC

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:23.849
OCEAN. YEAH IT JUST SEEMS THAT.

02:00:23.916 --> 02:00:24.951
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THESE

02:00:25.017 --> 02:00:26.218
DEVICES THAT THERE DON'T THEY

02:00:26.285 --> 02:00:27.353
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INCENTIVE

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:30.222
TO GO AND TRY TO COLLECT. ONCE

02:00:30.289 --> 02:00:30.856
THEY'RE IN THE KINDEST ONCE ARE

02:00:30.923 --> 02:00:35.328
UNDER WATER. AND MAYBE. YOU

02:00:35.394 --> 02:00:35.861
KNOW THAT'S AN AREA WHERE

02:00:35.928 --> 02:00:37.029
PENALTIES. MIGHT HELP THEM.

02:00:37.096 --> 02:00:39.031
PROACTIVELY DEAL WITH THAT. TO

02:00:39.098 --> 02:00:41.167
SURVIVE. AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP

02:00:41.233 --> 02:00:41.767
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE

02:00:41.834 --> 02:00:42.768
THINKING ABOUT ENFORCEMENT FOR

02:00:42.835 --> 02:00:44.070
US AS WE- YOU KNOW BALANCING

02:00:44.136 --> 02:00:46.072
THE SORT OF FEE TO OPERATORS

02:00:46.138 --> 02:00:47.640
AND JUST IN TERMS OF THEIR

02:00:47.707 --> 02:00:48.941
COSTS FOR PUTTING A NEW ONE OUT

02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:50.376
INTO THE STREETS I MEAN. YOU

02:00:50.443 --> 02:00:53.279
KNOW IF FOR US IF WE CHARGE TOO

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:54.580
GREAT OF A PENALTY FOR THE SOME

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:55.748
OF THESE OPERATORS THEY HAVE NO

02:00:55.815 --> 02:00:56.816
INCENTIVE TO GO GET IT AND

02:00:56.882 --> 02:00:58.284
THEY'D RATHER JUST BUY A NEW

02:00:58.351 --> 02:00:59.385
ONE AND PUT IT ON THE STREETS

02:00:59.452 --> 02:01:01.587
AND YOU KNOW GET FROM US. WHERE

02:01:01.654 --> 02:01:02.989
IS OUR EXPERIENCE OF-

02:01:03.055 --> 02:01:04.657
PROACTIVELY BOTH REQUIRING THAT

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:05.992
THE SCOOTERS THE LOCK TO A BIKE

02:01:06.058 --> 02:01:07.593
RACK BUT ALSO STRUCTURING- THE

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:09.195
COST OF THIS BIKE RACKS A BILL

02:01:09.261 --> 02:01:10.162
TO THE SCREW COMPANIES FEES SO

02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:11.964
YOU CAN. YOU CAN CHARGE AND-

02:01:12.031 --> 02:01:13.165
THE COST OF PULLING OUT OF THE

02:01:13.232 --> 02:01:14.634
WATER OR YOU CAN. CHARGE OF A

02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:15.835
LOT SMALLER COST TO BUILD A

02:01:15.901 --> 02:01:17.003
GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE OF BIKE

02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:18.738
RACKS AND HAVE THOSE. SCOOTERS

02:01:18.804 --> 02:01:23.709
LOCKS OF THE VANDALISM IS LESS.

02:01:23.776 --> 02:01:24.210
IS A LESS IMPACTFUL THE

02:01:24.276 --> 02:01:28.180
PUBLIC'S OF THE PROJECT. IF YOU

02:01:28.247 --> 02:01:29.148
WERE PUTTING GEO FENCES AROUND

02:01:29.215 --> 02:01:29.982
THE VENICE SO IN LA IT'S THE

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:30.549
VENICE CANALS IS WHERE THEY

02:01:30.616 --> 02:01:31.150
WERE ENDING UP SO WE PUT AT. A

02:01:31.217 --> 02:01:31.751
GEO FENCE AROUND THE CANALS

02:01:31.817 --> 02:01:33.686
ITSELF. AND SO BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:34.286
THE INFORMATION IN ALMOST REAL

02:01:34.353 --> 02:01:36.722
TIME ABOUT. IF THESE THINGS END

02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:39.091
UP THERE WE- ARE ABLE TO GO OUT

02:01:39.158 --> 02:01:40.993
AND DO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IN A

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:42.461
HIGHLY VISIBLE WAY THAT

02:01:42.528 --> 02:01:45.331
CREATES. A REAL DISINCENTIVE-

02:01:45.398 --> 02:01:46.465
FOR THE COMPANIES TO DO THAT

02:01:46.532 --> 02:01:47.800
BECAUSE THEIR WHOLE PERMIT TO

02:01:47.867 --> 02:01:49.835
OPERATE LOS ANGELES IS. AT

02:01:49.902 --> 02:01:52.338
STAKE IF THEY CAN'T. STAY OUT

02:01:52.405 --> 02:01:54.040
OF THAT THIS ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:01:54.106 --> 02:01:54.640
SENSITIVE AREA TO BEGIN WITH.

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:56.976
RIGHT THANK YOU. SENATOR

02:01:57.043 --> 02:02:01.347
MORLOCK. YOUR CHAIR OF WORKING

02:02:01.414 --> 02:02:04.383
HERE IN SACRAMENTO I. LEAVE THE

02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:06.619
OFFICE LATER IN THE DAY I LIKE

02:02:06.686 --> 02:02:08.054
TO AVOID TRAFFIC AND I LIKE TO

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:09.655
WORK COURTS QUITE IN THE OFFICE

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:11.924
BEFORE I GO TO MY PLACE HERE.

02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:14.460
AND WHAT I'VE NOTICED WITH THE

02:02:14.527 --> 02:02:17.229
SCOOTERS IS NOT THAT THEY ARE

02:02:17.296 --> 02:02:18.964
ASSISTING PEOPLE WITH TRANSIT

02:02:19.031 --> 02:02:20.466
TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B.

02:02:20.533 --> 02:02:20.900
BUT THEY TEND TO BE

02:02:20.966 --> 02:02:23.836
RECREATIONAL AND I SEE GROUPS

02:02:23.903 --> 02:02:26.539
OF YOUNG ADULTS JUST WHIZZING

02:02:26.605 --> 02:02:31.577
BY- FLYING OFF CURBS A IN

02:02:31.644 --> 02:02:32.211
GROUPS IT'S JUST A RECREATIONAL

02:02:32.278 --> 02:02:36.482
KIND OF. EXERCISER LIKE A NIGHT

02:02:36.549 --> 02:02:37.717
OUT KIND OF A OPPORTUNITY YOU

02:02:37.783 --> 02:02:39.085

02:02:42.088 --> 02:02:44.523
CORRECTLY- WILL. YOU KNOW WHAT

02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:46.258
ARE THEY REALLY BEING USED FOR

02:02:46.325 --> 02:02:47.326
WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE

02:02:47.393 --> 02:02:48.294
HAVEN'T COLLECTED THE DATA ON

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:50.663
THAT SUCH A GREAT QUESTION- WE

02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:52.898
DO KNOW THAT OUR- OURDEVICES

02:02:52.965 --> 02:02:54.633

SCOOTERS IN A LITTLE BIT TWO

02:02:57.870 --> 02:02:59.705
MILES ON BIKES ARE FOR EACH

02:02:59.772 --> 02:03:01.474
TRIP- SO THAT'S INCLUDED MAYBE

MEMBER- MORE PERMIT COMPANIES

02:03:13.352 --> 02:03:14.353
TO GET A BETTER UNDERSANDING

02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:16.355
OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING. WE ARE

02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:17.757
IT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING REALLY

02:03:17.823 --> 02:03:19.625
HARD EDUCATING THE USERS SO

02:03:19.692 --> 02:03:22.361
THEY KNOW- HOW TO SAFELY USE A

02:03:22.428 --> 02:03:23.662
SCOOTER OR SHARED BIKE AND

02:03:23.729 --> 02:03:25.865
URBAN ENVIRONMENTS. WE OFFER

02:03:25.931 --> 02:03:28.567
FREE CLASSES EVERY MONTH- WE

02:03:28.634 --> 02:03:30.369
WENT OUT WITH PD AND CH FEET

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:31.537
GIVEN OUT INFORMATIONAL FLIERS

02:03:31.604 --> 02:03:33.105
WE'VE DONE OUR VIDEOS SOCIAL

02:03:33.172 --> 02:03:35.474
MEDIA- BUT IT HASN'T BEEN

02:03:35.541 --> 02:03:36.375
ENOUGH WE RELY ON THE COMPANIES

02:03:36.442 --> 02:03:37.977
WE ACTUALLY REQUIRE IN OUR

02:03:38.043 --> 02:03:39.345
PERMIT. THEN THEY ALSO DO THEIR

02:03:39.411 --> 02:03:41.013
OWN EDUCATION I DON'T REALLY

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:41.881
THINK THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY COME

02:03:41.947 --> 02:03:43.249
TO FRUITION OR TO THE LEVEL

02:03:43.315 --> 02:03:45.284
THAT WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED-

02:03:45.351 --> 02:03:46.852
AND SO WE WILL BE ROLLING OUT

02:03:46.919 --> 02:03:47.887
ON ENFORCEMENT AND SCOOTING ON

02:03:47.953 --> 02:03:49.622
SIDEWALKS AND- PARKING

02:03:49.688 --> 02:03:50.589
ILLEGALLY BALKING ABOUT THE

TRAVEL. THIS MONTH ON IT'S NOT

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:54.326
MEANT TO BE PUNITIVE IT IS NOT

MEANT TO COLLECT ANY SORT OF

02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:57.163
CITATION FEET BUT IT'S REALLY

02:03:57.229 --> 02:04:02.201
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE. IN THE

02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:02.835
FOLKS OUT THERE UNDERSTAND THAT

02:04:02.902 --> 02:04:09.141
GOOD BEHAVIOR. BUT A WITH ANY

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:12.545
OF THESE. MOVING. OPPORTUNITIES

INTERESTING. THINGS WITH THEM-

02:04:16.282 --> 02:04:18.217
SO I JUST WONDER WOULD THE

OWNERS OF THESE SCOOTERS WOULD

02:04:19.518 --> 02:04:19.985

AND FOR THAT ARE NOT DEFENSIBLE

02:08:31.603 --> 02:08:33.839
AND SO IT'S FAIRLY REASONABLE

02:08:33.906 --> 02:08:36.075
TO ISSUE CITATIONS FOR THINGS

02:08:36.141 --> 02:08:36.975

OSTENSIBLY THE SHOULD BE PUBLIC

02:08:42.714 --> 02:08:43.615
TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:08:43.682 --> 02:08:45.617
USING THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY-

02:08:45.684 --> 02:08:46.985
THE SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES

02:08:47.052 --> 02:08:49.521
ABOUT EQUITY AND ABOUT ACCESS

02:08:49.588 --> 02:08:51.356

02:08:51.423 --> 02:08:53.058
THOSE ARE REALLY HARD TO ISSUE

02:08:53.125 --> 02:08:56.361

02:11:17.002 --> 02:11:17.703
THAT TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS ABOUT

02:11:17.769 --> 02:11:18.270
THE INDUSTRY WE AGGRESSIVELY

02:11:18.337 --> 02:11:18.904
EXPANDED ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:20.138
AND- YES WE DIDN'T ALWAYS ASK

02:11:20.205 --> 02:11:21.640
FOR PERMISSION. AND I THINK

02:11:21.707 --> 02:11:23.342
THAT MEANS LEARNING THAT WE HAD

02:11:23.408 --> 02:11:24.309
WAS THAT THIS WASN'T THE RIGHT

02:11:24.376 --> 02:11:25.644
APPROACH. THAT NO MATTER HOW

02:11:25.711 --> 02:11:27.112
POPULAR ARE SCREWS WERE WITH WE

02:11:27.179 --> 02:11:28.213
SHOULD JST BE COPYING THE

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:29.715
PLAYBOOKS OF OTHERS. AND THAT

02:11:29.781 --> 02:11:31.450
WE HAD A SHARE RESPONSIBILITIES

02:11:31.516 --> 02:11:32.017
THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE

02:11:32.084 --> 02:11:32.884
OPERATE IT. AND THAT WAS OUR

02:11:32.951 --> 02:11:34.720
FIRST MAJOR LEARNING. AND SO WE

02:11:34.786 --> 02:11:35.921
MAY TWENTY NINETEEN ABOUT THE

02:11:35.988 --> 02:11:37.389
CITIES WE STOP WATCHING WITHOUT

02:11:37.456 --> 02:11:38.724
PERMISSION. WE REACHED OUT TO

02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:40.025
EVERY CITY IN CALIFORNIA. TO

02:11:40.092 --> 02:11:41.126
DEVELOP THEIR OWN SURE DOC WAS

02:11:41.193 --> 02:11:42.361
PROGRAM. EACH WITH THEIR OWN

02:11:42.427 --> 02:11:43.495
RULES TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:44.529
THE COMMUNITY WE'VE HEARD A

02:11:44.596 --> 02:11:46.598
LOT. ABOUT THEM FROM- FROM THE

02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:47.699
PREVIOUS PANEL. AND THEY'VE

02:11:47.766 --> 02:11:49.301
DONE VERY WELL AND A SON BEAR

02:11:49.368 --> 02:11:52.070
IT REMARKABLY WELL FOR THE

02:11:52.137 --> 02:11:52.571
GROWTH OF SHARED MICHAEL

02:11:52.638 --> 02:11:55.841
ABILITY AND CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER

02:11:55.907 --> 02:11:56.541
WHAT I WANT TO BRING TO WHAT

02:11:56.608 --> 02:11:57.142
WHAT I WANT TO DISCUSS TODAY.

02:11:57.209 --> 02:11:58.510
IS THIS IS FROM OUR SIDE. THE

02:11:58.577 --> 02:11:59.144
SECOND MAJOR LEARNING THAT WE

02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:00.312
LEARN FROM THESE REGULATION. IS

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:01.913
THAT IT WORKS BUT IT COMES AT A

02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:03.582
COST. AND I DON'T MEAN THE COST

02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:05.250
UPON US BIRD THE CORPORATE AND

02:12:05.317 --> 02:12:07.319
SEE I MEAN UPON OUR WRITERS. IN

02:12:07.386 --> 02:12:08.320
LESS THAN A YEAR THE COST OF

02:12:08.387 --> 02:12:09.388
SHARED MICHAEL ABILITY IN

02:12:09.454 --> 02:12:10.756
CALIFORNIA HAS. TRIPLED AND IT

02:12:10.822 --> 02:12:12.457
CONTINUES TO GROW. IN SOME

02:12:12.524 --> 02:12:15.193
AREAS RIDERSHIP HAS DROPPED

02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:15.794
FIFTY TO EIGHTY PERCENT. MUCH

02:12:15.861 --> 02:12:16.595
OF ITS SWITCHING BACK TO CARSON

02:12:16.662 --> 02:12:19.064
DNC'S. AND SO WE'RE HERE BEFORE

02:12:19.131 --> 02:12:20.499
YOU TODAY TO RECONCILE THOSE

02:12:20.565 --> 02:12:21.767
TWO LEARNINGS. I HOPE THAT WE

02:12:21.833 --> 02:12:22.801
ALL AGREE THAT LEARNING FROM

02:12:22.868 --> 02:12:23.869
THE LESSONS OF T. AND SEES.

02:12:23.935 --> 02:12:26.571
THAT SHARED MICHAEL BILLY IS

02:12:26.638 --> 02:12:27.039
SOMETHING THAT IS BEST

02:12:27.105 --> 02:12:29.875
REGULATED ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. I

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:30.742
HOPE THAT WE ALSO ALL AGREE.

02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:31.643
THE CALIFORNIA WHAT CAN'T BE

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:32.277
PUSHING PEOPLE AWAY FROM BIKES

02:12:32.344 --> 02:12:34.179
AND SCOOTERS. AND TOWARDS CARS.

02:12:34.246 --> 02:12:35.147
AND IF ANYTHING THE OPPOSITE

02:12:35.213 --> 02:12:36.515
SHOULD BE TRUE. IN FACT

02:12:36.581 --> 02:12:37.749
EXISTING CALIFORNIA VEHICLE

02:12:37.816 --> 02:12:39.318
CODE TWO ONE TWO TWO ZERO

02:12:39.384 --> 02:12:40.752
ALREADY SAYS THAT. AND SO THESE

02:12:40.819 --> 02:12:42.454
TWO GOALS ARE POLICY PILLARS.

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:43.989
AND ACHIEVING THE REQUIRES

02:12:44.056 --> 02:12:44.990
COOPERATION BETWEEN NOT JUST

02:12:45.057 --> 02:12:46.191
BIRD IN THE CITIES BUT ALSO THE

02:12:46.258 --> 02:12:47.759
STATE. AND WE KNOW THE SOME

02:12:47.826 --> 02:12:48.527
PART BECAUSE WE ASK

02:12:48.593 --> 02:12:50.128
CALIFORNIA'S DIRECTLY. WITH ASK

02:12:50.195 --> 02:12:51.330
THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT

02:12:51.396 --> 02:12:52.597
WOULD MAKE YOU TAKE CARS LESSEN

02:12:52.664 --> 02:12:53.498
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU TAKE

02:12:53.565 --> 02:12:55.033
BURDEN. OTHER MICHAEL BUILDING

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:56.935
MORE. IN ALMOST EVERY TIME WE

02:12:57.002 --> 02:12:58.103
ALWAYS GET THE SAME THREE

02:12:58.170 --> 02:12:59.471
ANSWERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

02:12:59.538 --> 02:13:00.939
FIRST IS INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:13:01.006 --> 02:13:02.441
WRITERS DON'T FEEL SAFE. FROM

02:13:02.507 --> 02:13:04.543
CARS WITHOUT A PROTECTED BY

02:13:04.609 --> 02:13:05.444
PLANE. SO THEY STAY IN CARS

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:07.446
PERPETUATING A VICIOUS CYCLE. I

02:13:07.512 --> 02:13:08.480
THINK WE'RE ALL BUT VERY WELL

02:13:08.547 --> 02:13:09.681
FAMILIAR WITH THE CHALLENGES OF

02:13:09.748 --> 02:13:11.049
BUILDING COMPLETE STREETS. AND

02:13:11.116 --> 02:13:12.684
SO I WON'T REHASH THEM. BUT

02:13:12.751 --> 02:13:13.652
THAT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT

02:13:13.719 --> 02:13:14.619
WE'VE INTRODUCED MILLIONS OF

02:13:14.686 --> 02:13:16.254
CALIFORNIANS TO MY- MOBILITY.

02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:19.324
HELPING THEM. APPRECIATE WHAT

02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:19.925
PROTECTED BY PLEASE CAN DO FOR

02:13:19.991 --> 02:13:23.862
THE COMMUNITIES. SECOND IS

02:13:23.929 --> 02:13:24.563
AVAILABILITY. FOR

02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:25.197
TRANSPORTATION MODE TO BE

02:13:25.263 --> 02:13:26.164
RELIABLE AND A PART OF YOUR

02:13:26.231 --> 02:13:26.898
ROUTINE TO HAS TO BE READILY

02:13:26.965 --> 02:13:27.766
AVAILABLE. AND SO THAT'S WHY IN

02:13:27.833 --> 02:13:29.935
SAN FRANCISCO ALONE. THERE ARE

02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:30.836
FIFTY THOUSAND TNC DRIVERS ON

02:13:30.902 --> 02:13:32.537
THE ROADS. SO THAT WHENEVER YOU

02:13:32.604 --> 02:13:33.105
PULL OUT YOUR PHONE YOU CAN

02:13:33.171 --> 02:13:34.473
FIND A TNC CAR WITHIN A FEW

02:13:34.539 --> 02:13:35.874
MINUTES. HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES

02:13:35.941 --> 02:13:37.609
TO DOUGLAS MICHAEL ABILITY SAN

02:13:37.676 --> 02:13:40.712
FRANCISCO'S LIMITED TO TWENTY

02:13:40.779 --> 02:13:41.213
FIVE HUNDRED DEVICES ONE

02:13:41.279 --> 02:13:41.780
TWENTIETH THE NUMBER OF TNC

02:13:41.847 --> 02:13:45.117
DRIVERS. IMAGINE IF IT'LL

02:13:45.183 --> 02:13:46.017
TWENTY TIMES AS LONG TO GET A

02:13:46.084 --> 02:13:47.552
TNC CAR. COULD YOU WOULD YOU TO

02:13:47.619 --> 02:13:48.820
RELY ON THAT AS AN OPTION TO

02:13:48.887 --> 02:13:50.155
GET TO WORK. OR WOULD YOU FIND

02:13:50.222 --> 02:13:51.723
SOMETHING ELSE. AND FINALLY IS

02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:53.125
COSTS. AS I MENTIONED

02:13:53.191 --> 02:13:54.993
PREVIOUSLY THE COST OF SHARE

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:55.794
MICHAEL BUILDING CALIFORNIA HAS

02:13:55.861 --> 02:13:57.696
TRIPLED IN LESS THAN A YEAR. IN

02:13:57.763 --> 02:14:00.499
SOME PLACES AND NOW COSTS MORE

02:14:00.565 --> 02:14:01.099
TAKE A SCOOTER BUT IT DOESN'T

02:14:01.166 --> 02:14:03.502
TAKE A TNC CAR. THIS IS DUE TO

02:14:03.568 --> 02:14:05.003
MANY REASONS ONE OF WHICH HAS

02:14:05.070 --> 02:14:05.537
TO DO WITH THE DYSTROPHY

02:14:05.604 --> 02:14:07.139
STRUCTURE THAT. THAT MOBILITY

02:14:07.205 --> 02:14:08.707
FACES IN CALIFORNIA. THROUGHOUT

02:14:08.774 --> 02:14:10.242
THE STATE CALIFORNIANS WRITING

02:14:10.308 --> 02:14:12.911
IN THE TNC CAR. PAID ZERO POINT

02:14:12.978 --> 02:14:15.147
25% OF THEIR FARE TO THE CPC. I

02:14:15.213 --> 02:14:17.082
CONTRAST DEPENDING ON THE CITY

02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:18.417
CALIFORNIA'S WRITING ON SHARED

02:14:18.483 --> 02:14:21.119
BIKES AND SCOOTERS PAY BETWEEN

02:14:21.186 --> 02:14:21.953
TWENTY TO EIGHTY TIMES THAT.

02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:23.188
ENOUGH FIGURE CONTINUES TO

02:14:23.255 --> 02:14:25.023
RISE. FOR SURE MICHAEL ABILITY

02:14:25.090 --> 02:14:27.526
TO FULFILL ITS MOTION POTENTIAL

02:14:27.592 --> 02:14:28.126
HAS TO BE AN OPTION AVAILABLE

02:14:28.193 --> 02:14:30.529
TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE SEE

02:14:30.595 --> 02:14:31.530
THESE AS THE THREE MAKE

02:14:31.596 --> 02:14:32.664
CONSTRAINTS ON THE GROWTH OF

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:34.065
MICHAEL BUILDING CALIFORNIA

02:14:34.132 --> 02:14:36.168
INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABILITY AND

02:14:36.234 --> 02:14:37.569
COST. THESE ARE NOT CHALLENGES

02:14:37.636 --> 02:14:39.404
THAT CAN BE SOLVED BY BIRD LOAN

02:14:39.471 --> 02:14:41.106
OR BY THE CITY'S ALONE OR BY

02:14:41.173 --> 02:14:41.706
THE STATE ALONE AND THEY HAVE

02:14:41.773 --> 02:14:43.442
TO BE SOLVED BY ALL THREE OF US

02:14:43.508 --> 02:14:44.543
TOGETHER. WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY

02:14:44.609 --> 02:14:47.179
FINAL POINT. HISTORICALLY A LOT

02:14:47.245 --> 02:14:48.513
OF TECH COMPANIES MISSIONS HAVE

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:50.248
BEEN FOUR THOUSAND- OR EVEN

02:14:50.315 --> 02:14:51.950
OPPOSED TOWARDS THE PUBLIC

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:53.285
INTEREST. BUT OUR MISSION ISN'T

02:14:53.351 --> 02:14:55.153
TO SELL POLITICAL ADS OR TO GET

02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:57.122
YOUR PACKAGE ONE DAY SOONER OUR

02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:58.657
MISSION IS TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF

02:14:58.723 --> 02:14:59.991
CARS AND I BELIEVE THAT'S A

02:15:00.058 --> 02:15:01.159
MISSION THE ALMOST EVERYONE IN

02:15:01.226 --> 02:15:02.494
THIS ROOM SHARES. WERE ALL ON

02:15:02.561 --> 02:15:04.196
THE SAME TEAM AND SO AS WE

02:15:04.262 --> 02:15:05.597
PIONEERED THIS INDUSTRY WE HOPE

02:15:05.664 --> 02:15:07.666
TO ALSO PIONEER A NEW PLAYBOOK

02:15:07.732 --> 02:15:09.234
THAT'S HOW WE INTERACT WITH

02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:10.869
LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS ONE

02:15:10.936 --> 02:15:12.170
THAT ISN'T BASED ON ASKING FOR

02:15:12.237 --> 02:15:13.305
FORGIVENESS. BUT TOWARDS

02:15:13.371 --> 02:15:13.839
COLLABORATING TOWARDS OUR

02:15:13.905 --> 02:15:16.575

02:15:18.376 --> 02:15:20.278
CITIES BUT I HOPE THE TWENTY

02:15:20.345 --> 02:15:21.313
TWENTIES THE YEAR. IN WHICH THE

02:15:21.379 --> 02:15:22.647
SEIZE ALL SETTLES AND WE FIND

02:15:22.714 --> 02:15:23.248
THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN THE

02:15:23.315 --> 02:15:25.283
INDUSTRY PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.

GOVERNMENT PLANNING EFFORTS.

02:17:14.359 --> 02:17:15.260
GETTING THIS RIGHT WILL REQUIRE

02:17:15.327 --> 02:17:16.728
AN ONGOING COLLABORATIVE

02:17:16.795 --> 02:17:17.862

02:18:21.726 --> 02:18:23.595
CONCERNS WE KNOW THAT CITIES

02:18:23.662 --> 02:18:25.163
CARE MOST ABOUT SAFETY

OVERSATURATION STREET VERSUS

SIDEWALK USAGE PARKING

02:18:28.266 --> 02:18:30.535
VIOLATIONS AND EQUITY CONCERNS

02:18:30.602 --> 02:18:31.803
AND I THINK THOSE WERE OUTLINED

02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:33.338
OUT QUITE NICELY BY MISS TO ON

02:18:33.405 --> 02:18:35.340
WHY IT AND HER SITES.

02:18:35.407 --> 02:18:37.142
OVERSEEING THESE PROGRAMS IS

02:18:37.208 --> 02:18:39.344
ALSO RESOURCES INTENSIVE TODAY

02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:40.145
AS CITY'S MINISTERS HERE CAN

02:18:40.211 --> 02:18:41.246
ATTEST AND HAVE IT TESTED

02:18:41.312 --> 02:18:43.114
TODAY. OUR HOPE IS AT BEST

02:18:43.181 --> 02:18:44.582
PRACTICES WILL BE IDENTIFIED

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:46.051
AND ADOPTED INTO THE REGULATORY

02:18:46.117 --> 02:18:48.286
SCHEME TO REDUCE THIS BURDEN-

02:18:48.353 --> 02:18:49.421
AND WE WOULD WELCOME THE

02:18:49.487 --> 02:18:50.789

TESTIMONY THAT THERE'S NO

02:18:52.924 --> 02:18:54.959
DOMINANT REGULATORY SCHEME. AND

02:18:55.026 --> 02:18:55.660
THEN THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

02:18:55.727 --> 02:18:58.363
FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW FOR

02:18:58.430 --> 02:18:58.930
CONTINUED INNOVATION IN THE

02:18:58.997 --> 02:19:02.133
SPACE. TO GET THERE WE ARE

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:02.734

02:19:11.443 --> 02:19:12.510
ABILITY TO COLLABORATE WITH

02:19:12.577 --> 02:19:13.812
THEM AND I WANTED TO SHARE

02:19:13.878 --> 02:19:15.847
RECENT EXAMPLE. WE ARE EXCITED

02:19:15.914 --> 02:19:17.215
TO PARTICIPATE IN A RECENT

02:19:17.282 --> 02:19:19.217
WORKSHOP WITH THE LAPD TO SHARE

02:19:19.284 --> 02:19:22.020
THAT JOHN VIA UBER HAS AN

ARE REALLY GOOD INVESTMENT FOR

02:19:27.525 --> 02:19:28.626
EVERYBODY FOLLOWING THE

02:19:28.693 --> 02:19:30.562
WORKSHOP MOST RECENTLY AN LAPD

02:19:30.628 --> 02:19:32.530
DETECTIVE CONTACTED OUR WEST

HOLLYWOOD LIAISON FOR

02:19:33.431 --> 02:19:35.567
ASSISTANCE WITH A HATE CRIME.

02:19:35.633 --> 02:19:36.668
OR A SUSPECT HAD USED TO ADD

02:19:36.735 --> 02:19:38.737
RIGHT SURE SCOOTER. WITHIN THE

02:19:38.803 --> 02:19:39.904
HOUR THE DETECTIVE WAS ABLE TO

02:19:39.971 --> 02:19:42.407
GET HIS ACCOUNT CREATED AND HAS

ELECTRONICALLY. CITIES CAN

02:19:45.877 --> 02:19:47.278
REALLY CHAMPION- INNOVATION AND

02:19:47.345 --> 02:19:48.580
TECHNOLOGY TO KEEP SIDEWALKS

02:19:48.646 --> 02:19:50.048
CLEAR AND ENSURE MY COME

02:19:50.115 --> 02:19:51.516
ABILITY IS SEEN AS A BENEFIT

02:19:51.583 --> 02:19:52.650
AND NOT A HEADACHE BY USING

02:19:52.717 --> 02:19:54.285
INTELLIGENT REGULATIONS. I

02:19:54.352 --> 02:19:55.687
BELIEVE OTHER PANELISTS HAD

02:19:55.754 --> 02:19:57.055
DISCUSSED- DISCUSSED A COUPLE

02:19:57.122 --> 02:19:58.923
OPTIONS INCLUDING PERFORMANCE

02:19:58.990 --> 02:20:00.759
SPACE PERMITS I BELIEVE THIS IS

02:20:00.825 --> 02:20:01.426
A TECHNIQUE THAT SOME PLAYED BY

02:20:01.493 --> 02:20:03.962
SANTA MONICA WITH SOME SUCCESS-

02:20:04.028 --> 02:20:04.863
WE WOULD ENCOURAGE LIKE WHEN

02:20:04.929 --> 02:20:07.031
USING PERFORMANCE BASED PERMITS

02:20:07.098 --> 02:20:08.666
THAT. GOOD ACTORS ARE REPORTED.

02:20:08.733 --> 02:20:11.336
AS WE WERE LOCK TO BIKE

02:20:11.402 --> 02:20:12.237
REQUIREMENTS THIS IS SOMETHING

02:20:12.303 --> 02:20:12.737
THAT OFFICIALS FROM SAN

02:20:12.804 --> 02:20:15.206
FRANCISCO REALLY EMPHASIZED-

02:20:15.273 --> 02:20:16.474
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT OUR JUMP

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:17.842
BIKES HOWEVER- HAVE A TRUE

02:20:17.909 --> 02:20:20.745
LOCKING DESIGN- WHICH HELPS

02:20:20.812 --> 02:20:21.246
KEEP THE CITY'S. STREETS

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:24.182
ORDERLY AND SAFE. I ALSO REALLY

02:20:24.249 --> 02:20:24.916
SUPPORT RIGHT SIZE FLEETS TO

02:20:24.983 --> 02:20:26.684
AVOID OVERCROWDING ISSUE AND

02:20:26.751 --> 02:20:27.952
IMPLEMENTING TRIP OPTIMIZE FLEA

02:20:28.019 --> 02:20:31.890
CAPS. THIS IS THE APPROACH THAT

02:20:31.956 --> 02:20:32.423
WE'VE SEEN IN PLACES LIKE

02:20:32.490 --> 02:20:35.860
WASHINGTON DC. ONE MINUTE.

02:20:35.927 --> 02:20:36.861
WE'RE ALSO USING TECHNOLOGY TO

02:20:36.928 --> 02:20:38.096
PILE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS LIKE

SIDEWALK DETECTION AND MAPPING

02:20:39.297 --> 02:20:40.131
SO WE CAN IMPROVE THE

02:20:40.198 --> 02:20:41.866
LIMITATIONS OF GPS AND CREATE A

02:20:41.933 --> 02:20:43.635
MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK LOOP TO

02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:44.169
USERS ABOUT RIPRAP WRITING

02:20:44.235 --> 02:20:46.771
BEHAVIOR. WE CAN ALSO DRAW ON

OUR EXPERIENCE NOW IN THE

ALSO SUPPORT UNIFORM DATA

02:21:16.835 --> 02:21:18.603
SHARING TO STANDARDS FOR CITIES

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:20.004
TO RECEIVE TIMELY AGGREGATED

02:21:20.071 --> 02:21:21.339

02:21:21.406 --> 02:21:22.407
WHEN TRAFFIC PATTERNS HUMAN

02:21:22.473 --> 02:21:24.108
BEHAVIOR AND TRENDS CHANGE.

02:21:24.175 --> 02:21:25.176
HOWEVER WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE

02:21:25.243 --> 02:21:26.711
DIRECTION WE'VE SEEN IN SOME

02:21:26.778 --> 02:21:27.712
CITIES THAT REQUIRES REAL TIME

REALLY COMPLICATED AND NEW AREA

02:21:47.732 --> 02:21:48.199
OF THE LAW AND WE'D REALLY

02:21:48.266 --> 02:21:49.968
ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE TO

02:21:50.034 --> 02:21:50.568
TAKE THE TIME TO SLOW DOWN AND

02:21:50.635 --> 02:21:52.804
UNDERSTAND ALL THE NUANCES HERE.

GOVERNMENTS CAN MAKE GREAT

02:22:25.937 --> 02:22:27.739
STRIDES AT REDUCING CONESTION

THOSE. ARE HERE TODAY ASSEMBLY

02:22:47.292 --> 02:22:47.859
MEMBER FOR THE BILL THAT'S BEEN

02:22:47.926 --> 02:22:51.663
PUT FORTH. IT'S INTERESTING BUT

02:22:51.729 --> 02:22:52.263
THE LAST TO SPEAK IS THE ONE

02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:52.764
WHO IS WORRIED ABOUT THE

02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:54.365
WRITER. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

02:22:54.432 --> 02:22:55.667
SOMETHING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:22:55.733 --> 02:22:57.368
IS NOT LOST IN THIS. THERE'S

02:22:57.435 --> 02:22:59.404
BUT YOU KNOW AND WE HEARD THAT

02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:00.238
THEY WANT TO BOUNCE BETWEEN

02:23:00.305 --> 02:23:02.674

SAFETY AND PROTECTION TO THOSE

02:23:10.548 --> 02:23:12.884
WHO ARE USING THEM. AND I THINK

02:23:12.951 --> 02:23:14.919
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

02:23:14.986 --> 02:23:15.920
WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH MOM AND

02:23:15.987 --> 02:23:17.789
POP ORGANIZATIONS. WE'RE

02:23:17.855 --> 02:23:19.090
DEALING WITH LEFT WE'RE DEALING

02:23:19.157 --> 02:23:21.059
WITH UBER. I WAS PERSONALLY

02:23:21.125 --> 02:23:23.061
INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS

02:23:23.127 --> 02:23:24.562
AND THE DRAFTING OF THE TNC

02:23:24.629 --> 02:23:26.564
BILL THAT RELATED TO INSURANCE

02:23:26.631 --> 02:23:27.832
I WAS HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

02:23:27.899 --> 02:23:29.567
NIGHT MAKING SURE THAT WE GOT A

02:23:29.634 --> 02:23:30.702
DEAL DONE. I KNOW HOW THAT

02:23:30.768 --> 02:23:32.770
SAUSAGE WAS MADE WE HEARD THE

02:23:32.837 --> 02:23:34.672
SAME ARGUMENTS THAT WE'RE

02:23:34.739 --> 02:23:36.007
HEARING NOW WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT

02:23:36.074 --> 02:23:38.276
DNC'S INSURANCE IS GOING TO

02:23:38.343 --> 02:23:40.345
STYMIE THE INDUSTRY WE'RE GOING

02:23:40.411 --> 02:23:41.579
TO BE SOMEHOW RESTRICTED IF WE

02:23:41.646 --> 02:23:43.781
HAVE TO BE- REQUIRED TO FOLLOW

02:23:43.848 --> 02:23:45.216
LEGISLATION OR WE HAVE TO BE

02:23:45.283 --> 02:23:47.185
REQUIRED TO FOLLOW RULES. WE

02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:48.920
SAW THE EXACT SAME BEHAVIOR

02:23:48.987 --> 02:23:50.922
HERE THAT WE SAW WITH PNC'S

02:23:50.989 --> 02:23:51.856
DUMP THEM ON THE STREET THEN

02:23:51.923 --> 02:23:54.258
ASK FOR REGULATION LATER. THIS

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:56.527
IS NOT NEW THIS IS JUST A NEW

02:23:56.594 --> 02:23:58.496
FORM OF TRANSPORTATION

02:23:58.563 --> 02:24:01.199
TRANSPORTATION IS NOT NEW. WHAT

02:24:01.265 --> 02:24:02.467
WE ARE SEEING WITH THE

02:24:02.533 --> 02:24:05.303
STATISTICS IS THAT 55% OF

02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:06.871
PEOPLE WHO ARE INJURED ON THESE

02:24:06.938 --> 02:24:08.239
THINGS ARE INJURED WITH HEAD

02:24:08.306 --> 02:24:10.575
INJURIES. WHERE DO THESE PEOPLE

02:24:10.641 --> 02:24:12.343
GO WE'RE HEARING THAT THESE ARE

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:13.444
MANY FOLKS WHO HAVE LOWER

02:24:13.511 --> 02:24:15.713
INCOME. THEY WIND UP IN THE

02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:17.849
CITY'S EMERGENCY ROOMS THEY

02:24:17.915 --> 02:24:20.151
WIND UP SEEKING MEDICARE NOW SO

02:24:20.218 --> 02:24:22.220
WHO IS PAYING FOR THE COST THE

02:24:22.286 --> 02:24:23.621
TRUE COST OF THE USE OF THESE

02:24:23.688 --> 02:24:25.056
ITEMS WHEN PEOPLE ARE INJURED.

02:24:25.123 --> 02:24:26.958
THE TAXPAYERS ARE NOT THE

02:24:27.025 --> 02:24:28.226
COMPANIES WHO ARE FORWARDING

02:24:28.292 --> 02:24:30.495
THIS TYPE OF A SERVICE IN THERE

02:24:30.561 --> 02:24:32.296
IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE

02:24:32.363 --> 02:24:34.032
SURE THAT THERE IS INSURANCE TO

02:24:34.098 --> 02:24:36.000
COVER INJURY TO PERSONS. WHO

02:24:36.067 --> 02:24:37.435
ARE USING THESE DEVICES BY

02:24:37.502 --> 02:24:39.737
HAVING A SMALL SURCHARGE ON

02:24:39.804 --> 02:24:41.439
WHATEVER THERE IS THE COST THIS

02:24:41.506 --> 02:24:43.841
IS NOT NEW THIS IS HAPPENED FOR

02:24:43.908 --> 02:24:45.043
EVER WE HAVE MINIMUM INSURANCE

02:24:45.109 --> 02:24:47.545
REQUIREMENTS ON CARS THIS IS

02:24:47.612 --> 02:24:49.480
JUST ANOTHER FORM OF A VEHICLE.

02:24:49.547 --> 02:24:53.217
INDEED WE NOW HAVE I SAW TODAY

02:24:53.284 --> 02:24:54.786
THE BIRD IS RENTING THESE BY

02:24:54.852 --> 02:24:57.055
THE MONTH. SO THIS IS NOT JUST

02:24:57.121 --> 02:25:00.324
LAST MILE TRANSPORTATION BUT

02:25:00.391 --> 02:25:00.958
FOR TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE YOU

02:25:01.025 --> 02:25:01.592
CAN RENT ONE OF THESE SCOOTERS

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:03.628
EXCLUSIVELY FOR A MONTH. I KNOW

02:25:03.694 --> 02:25:05.530
OF NO CAR RENTAL AGENCY THAT

02:25:05.596 --> 02:25:07.532
WOULD SEEK THE BENEFITS THE

02:25:07.598 --> 02:25:08.466
PROTECTION OF THEIR CONTRACTS

02:25:08.533 --> 02:25:11.636
WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING.

02:25:11.702 --> 02:25:12.236
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY UP TO

02:25:12.303 --> 02:25:18.443
ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. A

02:25:18.509 --> 02:25:19.010
RESTRICTION IN A WAIVER OF

02:25:19.077 --> 02:25:19.877
LIABILITY EVEN IF THEIR DEVICE

02:25:19.944 --> 02:25:21.679
CATCHES ON FIRE IN YOUR HOME.

02:25:21.746 --> 02:25:22.747
IF THE DEVICE FALLS APART WHICH

02:25:22.814 --> 02:25:23.481
WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF

02:25:23.548 --> 02:25:24.515
HANDLEBARS COME OFF OF PEOPLE

02:25:24.582 --> 02:25:26.084
SUFFERING HEAD INJURIES WE SAW

02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:27.952
A LONGTIME PULLING THESE THINGS

02:25:28.019 --> 02:25:28.619
OFF THE STREET BECAUSE THEY

02:25:28.686 --> 02:25:30.054
WERE CATCHING FIRE IN PEOPLE'S

02:25:30.121 --> 02:25:31.889
HOMES AND WE SAW BREAKING

02:25:31.956 --> 02:25:33.391
MALFUNCTIONS WHERE PEOPLE WERE

02:25:33.458 --> 02:25:34.959
GOING HEAD OVER HEELS. AND

02:25:35.026 --> 02:25:36.961
SUFFERING SERIOUS INJURIES THE

02:25:37.028 --> 02:25:38.229
WAY THEIR CONTRACTS ARE WRITTEN

02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:40.765
RIGHT NOW A COMPLETE WAIVER AND

02:25:40.832 --> 02:25:43.234
RELEASE OF LIABILITY AGAINST

02:25:43.301 --> 02:25:44.869
THEM EVEN IF IT'S THEIR PRODUCT

02:25:44.936 --> 02:25:46.771
THAT FAILS WITH A HUNDRED

02:25:46.838 --> 02:25:49.273
DOLLAR CAPON LIABILITY. SO YES

02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:50.842
THERE NEEDS TO BE A BALANCE BUT

02:25:50.908 --> 02:25:52.310
THAT BALANCE CAN'T LEAVE OUT

02:25:52.376 --> 02:25:54.579
THE CONSUMER WHO MAY BE HURT IN

02:25:54.645 --> 02:25:55.713
THE COST IT WILL HAVE ON THE

02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:57.748
GOVERNMENT. THESE ARE CAUSING

02:25:57.815 --> 02:26:00.284
REAL LIFE THREATENING INJURIES

02:26:00.351 --> 02:26:02.520
AND SO WHEN REGULATION YES

02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:03.821
NEEDS TO HAPPEN BUT WHEN WE'RE

02:26:03.888 --> 02:26:04.956
LOOKING AT REGULATION THAT

02:26:05.022 --> 02:26:06.557
AFFECTS THE CONSUMER IN THIS

02:26:06.624 --> 02:26:08.426
WAY IT HAS TO HAPPEN ON THE

02:26:08.493 --> 02:26:10.061
STATE LEVEL. IT CAN HAPPEN ON

02:26:10.128 --> 02:26:11.796
THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WE HEAR

02:26:11.863 --> 02:26:13.598
COSTA BECOME PROHIBITIVE WE

02:26:13.664 --> 02:26:14.765
HEARD THAT THE COSTS TRIPLED

02:26:14.832 --> 02:26:16.267
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THE COST IS

02:26:16.334 --> 02:26:18.669
PROBABLY INITIALLY VERY LOW TO

02:26:18.736 --> 02:26:20.872
ENCOURAGE ADOPTION. WE HAVE OF

02:26:20.938 --> 02:26:21.873
THE VARIOUS CITIES THAT ARE

02:26:21.939 --> 02:26:23.441
REQUIRING INSURANCE AND IT'S

02:26:23.508 --> 02:26:24.942
NOT PROHIBITED ANY ENTRANCE

02:26:25.009 --> 02:26:26.644
FROM THIS MARKET OR PEOPLE WHO

02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:30.148
ARE ACTUALLY- USING THESE OR

02:26:30.214 --> 02:26:31.349
BUSINESSES THAT ARE ALLOWING

02:26:31.415 --> 02:26:35.419
THEM. SO JUST A FEW THINGS THAT

02:26:35.486 --> 02:26:35.920
ARE IN EACH ONE OF THEIR

02:26:35.987 --> 02:26:42.960
AGREEMENTS. NO CLASS ACTIONS

02:26:43.027 --> 02:26:45.229
HANDLE DOWN IN LOS ANGELES

02:26:45.296 --> 02:26:47.999
ATTORNEYS FEES FOR. THE WINNER.

02:26:48.065 --> 02:26:49.734
OF A RELEASE OF LIABILITY

02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:51.836
INCLUDING ALL AFFILIATES

02:26:51.903 --> 02:26:54.238
MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS OF

02:26:54.305 --> 02:26:56.174
THE VEHICLES IN THEIR PARTS.

02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:59.443
THE WAIVER OF ANY MUNICIPAL-

02:26:59.510 --> 02:27:00.912
LIABILITY AND A COMPLETE

02:27:00.978 --> 02:27:02.813
ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK. SO WHAT

02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:03.581
WE'RE HEARING AND THESE THINGS

02:27:03.648 --> 02:27:04.982
ARE LIKE JUMPING OUT OF PLANES

02:27:05.049 --> 02:27:06.384
ARE THESE THINGS ARE SOMEHOW

02:27:06.450 --> 02:27:07.585

TRANSPORTATION. AND THE

02:27:15.359 --> 02:27:16.827
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE NOT

REQUIREMENT THAT THEY WEAR A

02:27:19.530 --> 02:27:21.232
HELMET. INDEED THERE'S NOTHING

02:27:21.299 --> 02:27:22.733
THAT THE COMPANIES DO TO MAKE

02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:23.801
SURE THEY WEAR A HELMET BY

02:29:10.508 --> 02:29:13.277
TEEN SEASON ONE NOT. FOR THE

02:29:13.344 --> 02:29:17.281

AND YOUR INDEPENDENT

02:29:19.817 --> 02:29:22.353
CONTRACTORS TO PICK UP IN

02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:26.324
CHARGE. PER UNIT. HOW THAT CAN

02:29:26.390 --> 02:29:30.094
AFFECT YOUR. BOTTOM LINE AS FAR

02:29:30.161 --> 02:29:32.697
AS TO THE CONSUMER NUMBER ONE

02:29:32.763 --> 02:29:33.297
AND THE FLEXIBILITY THE NIGHT

YOU KNOW LOSE. I THANK YOU

02:29:37.201 --> 02:29:37.735
MISTER CHAIR THE IT'S A GREAT

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:39.603
QUESTION TO STAR IN MANY CITIES

02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:40.671
WE ALREADY EMPLOYED ON FULL

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:42.807
TIME AND OR W. TO WORKERS- BE

02:29:42.873 --> 02:29:43.507
GIVEN LOCAL PERMIT

02:29:43.574 --> 02:29:45.209
REQUIREMENTS- IS AN EXAMPLE I

02:29:45.276 --> 02:29:46.277
THINK OF HOUSES SOME CITIES CAN

02:29:46.344 --> 02:29:48.279
PRIORITIZE- THEIR PARTICULAR

02:29:48.346 --> 02:29:49.580
WHAT THEY SEE AS MOST

02:29:49.647 --> 02:29:51.549
IMPORTANT. SECOND I THINK IS

02:29:51.615 --> 02:29:53.751
THAT OUR USE OF GIVE WORKERS IS

02:29:53.818 --> 02:29:54.385
VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF AN

02:29:54.452 --> 02:29:55.786
UBER DRIVER AND UBER DRIVERS IN

02:29:55.853 --> 02:29:56.854
IN LARGE PART BECAUSE ARGUED

02:29:56.921 --> 02:29:57.855
WORKERS PRIMARILY PICK UP

02:29:57.922 --> 02:29:58.956
SCOOTERS ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM

02:29:59.023 --> 02:30:00.791
WORK WERE ON THEIR WAY TO WORK

02:30:00.858 --> 02:30:02.360
ON LONG THE WAY THERE ISN'T A

02:30:02.426 --> 02:30:03.761
THERE'S A DEVICE THAT NEEDS TO

02:30:03.828 --> 02:30:04.662
BE CHARGED THEY CAN PICK IT UP.

02:30:04.729 --> 02:30:05.563
BRING IT HOME CHARGES AND THEN

02:30:05.629 --> 02:30:06.564
ON THE WAY BACK TO WORK DROP IT

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:08.432
OFF AGAIN IT'S VERY DIFFERENT

02:30:08.499 --> 02:30:10.301
THAN SOMEONE WHO RELIES ON IT

02:30:10.368 --> 02:30:12.403
WHO STRIVE WHO'S THAT HEADING

02:30:12.470 --> 02:30:13.537
AROUND ON THE SAN FRANCISCO

02:30:13.604 --> 02:30:15.272
STREETS ALL DAY. AND THIRD I

02:30:15.339 --> 02:30:16.607
THINK ON TO YOUR POINT IS AN

02:30:16.674 --> 02:30:18.342
EXAMPLE OF THE FLEXIBILITY OF

02:30:18.409 --> 02:30:19.110
THE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT DOES

02:30:19.176 --> 02:30:20.244
LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY I THINK

02:30:20.311 --> 02:30:21.445
THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN BENEFITS

02:30:21.512 --> 02:30:23.948
AND DRAWBACKS TO DO SO TO DOING

02:30:24.014 --> 02:30:24.715
SO NOW WE'VE EXPLORED LOCAL

02:30:24.782 --> 02:30:30.488
CITIES. AS THEY PROMULGATE.

02:30:30.554 --> 02:30:31.088
THEIR REGULATIONS RELATING TO

02:30:31.155 --> 02:30:39.730
THE LABOR THAT WE CAN HIRE.

02:30:39.797 --> 02:30:41.298
SHOW UP IN A TMELY MANNER

02:30:41.365 --> 02:30:43.334
BECAUSE IT WAS ADDRESSED. AND

02:30:43.401 --> 02:30:44.935
THERE WAS A COMPETITIVE NATURE

02:30:45.002 --> 02:30:45.870
THERE PUT HOW DOES THAT NOW

02:30:45.936 --> 02:30:48.639
CHANGE. THE CURRENTLY WE USE W.

02:30:48.706 --> 02:30:49.874
TO WORK FORCE WE USE A LOT OF

02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:51.409
STAFFING AGENCIES AND WE ALSO

02:30:51.475 --> 02:30:53.043
HAVE EMPLOYEES A RECORD WHERE

02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:54.612
WHERE THE EMPLOYER OF RECORD

02:30:54.678 --> 02:30:56.514
AND THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE. SO

02:30:56.580 --> 02:31:01.085
IT'LL BE. SAME THING. CATHERINE

02:31:01.152 --> 02:31:02.453
YOU'VE GOT NO EMPOWER HAVE ANY

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:04.155

AND I THINK THEY'RE AT THIS

02:41:19.770 --> 02:41:21.671
STAGE THERE ISN'T ANY ONE RIGHT

02:41:21.738 --> 02:41:22.272

02:41:22.339 --> 02:41:26.009
LOT OF- LOCALIZE AND THERE'S

02:41:26.076 --> 02:41:26.610

02:41:26.676 --> 02:41:31.014
ANSWER RIGHT. NOW IF I MAY.

02:41:31.081 --> 02:41:32.949
ABOUT GEO FENCING JUST AWHILE

02:41:33.016 --> 02:41:35.185
AGO REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT THAT

02:41:35.252 --> 02:41:37.187
SERGIO FENCING MEANS YOU CAN

02:41:37.254 --> 02:41:38.955
SET UP A BORDER AROUND CERTAIN

02:41:39.022 --> 02:41:41.191
AREAS TO MONITOR THE ACTIVITY

02:41:41.258 --> 02:41:43.460
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO

02:41:43.527 --> 02:41:44.327
REQUIRE THAT THE SCOOTER IN

02:41:44.394 --> 02:41:46.229
ORDER TO END THE RIDE BE PUT

02:41:46.296 --> 02:41:48.932
WITHIN A GEO FENCED AREA IN SAN

02:41:48.999 --> 02:41:51.001
FRANCISCO WE SEE THESE LYING ON

02:41:51.068 --> 02:41:53.103
THE GROUND AND WE SEE ELDERLY

02:41:53.170 --> 02:41:54.104

HANDICAPPED PEOPLE HAVE TO GET

02:41:59.309 --> 02:42:01.678
UP AND DOWN THE BIRD I THINK IT

02:42:01.745 --> 02:42:03.580
IS IF IT FALLS OVER ON ITS SIDE

02:42:03.647 --> 02:42:05.048
IT BEEPS SO THERE'S A WAY THAT

02:42:05.115 --> 02:42:07.184
THEY MAY KNOW AND DE THAT

02:42:07.250 --> 02:42:08.118
THROUGH THEIR OWN TECHNOLOGY IS

02:42:08.185 --> 02:42:10.554
THE THING ON THE SIDE BUT I DO

02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:12.422
BELIEVE THERE IS A WAY TO

02:42:12.489 --> 02:42:13.690
ADDRESS THE ADA ISSUES ARE

02:42:13.757 --> 02:42:16.359

02:43:17.821 --> 02:43:19.990
TO TURN IT OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY

02:43:20.056 --> 02:43:22.993
WOMAN FRIEDMAN AND THEN

02:43:23.059 --> 02:43:23.527
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI

02:43:23.593 --> 02:43:25.228
CINNAMON FORESHORES. YOU'RE

02:43:25.295 --> 02:43:26.196
JUST A TWO QUESTIONS QUICKLY

02:43:26.263 --> 02:43:28.031
FIRST FOR MISTER DOLE AND I'M

02:43:28.098 --> 02:43:31.001
JUST CURIOUS SO WHEN I RIDE. MY

02:43:31.067 --> 02:43:32.669
BIKE WHICH GOES A LOT FASTER.

02:43:32.736 --> 02:43:36.106
THAN A SCOOTER CAM. IF I RIDE

02:43:36.173 --> 02:43:37.641
MY HORSE WHO'S A LOT BIGGER

02:43:37.707 --> 02:43:39.042
GOES FASTER AND IS MUCH

02:43:39.109 --> 02:43:41.211
STUPIDER THAN A SCOOTER I DON'T

02:43:41.278 --> 02:43:42.846
HAVE TO WEAR A HELMET BY LAW.

02:43:42.913 --> 02:43:45.081
ON EITHER OF THOSE CASES SO I'M

02:43:45.148 --> 02:43:46.483
JUST CURIOUS I UNDERSTAND THE

02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:48.485
PEOPLE OF HEAD INJURIES FROM A

02:43:48.552 --> 02:43:50.353
SCOOTER SURVIVE BY USED ONE I

02:43:50.420 --> 02:43:50.954
MEAN IRA WHICH IS THE HOME OF

02:43:51.021 --> 02:43:52.489
MY WORSE I ALWAYS USE IT ON A

02:43:52.556 --> 02:43:53.924
BIKE I. I DON'T KNOW IF I ISN'T

02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:58.461
AS GOOD OR NOT- BUT LEGALLY I

02:43:58.528 --> 02:43:59.229
DON'T HAVE TO AND THOSE OTHER

02:43:59.296 --> 02:44:02.399
TWO. THAT TYPES OF MOBILITY AND

02:44:02.465 --> 02:44:03.033
THEY'RE CERTAINLY HEAD INJURIES

02:44:03.099 --> 02:44:03.600
WITH THOSE TWO SO I'M JUST

02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:04.968
WONDERING WHY YOU KEEP COMING

02:44:05.035 --> 02:44:07.771
BACK. TO THE HELMET ISSUE. IS

02:44:07.837 --> 02:44:08.838
IT BECAUSE YOU THINK THEY'RE

02:44:08.905 --> 02:44:10.640
MORE DANGEROUS ARE MORE PRONE

02:44:10.707 --> 02:44:12.609
THAN BICYCLES TO HEAD INJURIES

02:44:12.676 --> 02:44:13.977
OR IS IT BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:44:14.044 --> 02:44:15.345
RENTALS AND YOU THINK THAT

02:44:15.412 --> 02:44:16.680
SOMEHOW. THAT SHOULD COMPEL

02:44:16.746 --> 02:44:19.082
PEOPLE. ADULTS TO WEAR HELMETS

02:44:19.149 --> 02:44:21.084
EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE TO.

02:44:21.151 --> 02:44:22.953
ON BICYCLES OR OTHER TYPES OF

02:44:23.019 --> 02:44:25.021
DEVICES. THANK YOU FOR THE

02:44:25.088 --> 02:44:26.623
QUESTION. YOU ON YOUR HORSE YOU

02:44:26.690 --> 02:44:28.558
ON YOUR BIKE. YOU KNOW HOW THAT

02:44:28.625 --> 02:44:29.993
THEIR MAINTAINED YOU KNOW HOW

02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:31.394
THE HORSES FED WHETHER IT'S

02:44:31.461 --> 02:44:33.530
LAME. YOU WATCH YOUR BIKE YOU

02:44:33.597 --> 02:44:35.465
INSPECT YOUR BIKE. THEREFORE

02:44:35.532 --> 02:44:36.633
YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER YOUR

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:38.602
BIKE. I WAS A MOTORCYCLIST

02:44:38.668 --> 02:44:39.936
UNTIL I HAD A CATASTROPHIC

02:44:40.003 --> 02:44:42.105
MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT SIX YEARS

02:44:42.172 --> 02:44:43.740
AGO. STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:44:43.807 --> 02:44:44.541
REQUIRED ME TO WEAR A HELMET.

02:44:44.608 --> 02:44:45.976
THE REASON BEING THERE IS A

02:44:46.042 --> 02:44:48.211
GREATER PROPENSITY FOR INJURY

02:44:48.278 --> 02:44:49.312
TO MY HEAD. BY USING THAT FORM

02:44:49.379 --> 02:44:51.248
OF TRANSPORTATION. THESE

02:44:51.314 --> 02:44:52.849
SCOOTERS HAVE VERY SMALL

02:44:52.916 --> 02:44:54.317
WHEELS. YOUR BICYCLE HAS A

02:44:54.384 --> 02:44:56.319
LARGE WHEEL. WHEN YOU GO OVER A

02:44:56.386 --> 02:44:58.255
CRACK IN PAVEMENT- A POTHOLE.

02:44:58.321 --> 02:44:59.889
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE THROWN

02:44:59.956 --> 02:45:00.991
FROM YOUR BICYCLE BECAUSE

02:45:01.057 --> 02:45:01.992
THERE'S A GREATER AREA OF

02:45:02.058 --> 02:45:03.460
SURFACED IT'S TOUCHING THE

02:45:03.526 --> 02:45:04.527
GROUND OKAY SO YOU. YOU THINK

02:45:04.594 --> 02:45:05.895
THAT THE SCOOTERS THAN THAT

02:45:05.962 --> 02:45:07.197
THERE'S DATA THAT THEY ARE

02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:09.299
INHERENTLY. MORE UNSTABLE OR

02:45:09.366 --> 02:45:10.734
MORE DANGEROUS AND I I'VE I'VE

02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:12.035
ACTUALLY HEARD THE SAME THING

02:45:12.102 --> 02:45:13.270
SO I'M NOT ARGUING WITH YOU.

02:45:13.336 --> 02:45:14.638
BUT SO IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM

02:45:14.704 --> 02:45:16.172
BEING A RENTAL NECESSARILY THAT

02:45:16.239 --> 02:45:18.208
YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE. MORE

02:45:18.275 --> 02:45:19.743
DANGEROUS THAN A BICYCLE AND

02:45:19.809 --> 02:45:21.311
THEREFORE MORE. THERE SHOULD

02:45:21.378 --> 02:45:23.246
BE. SORT OF HIGHER SAFETY

02:45:23.313 --> 02:45:25.282
STANDARDS. FOR THE USER THAT'S

02:45:25.348 --> 02:45:29.319
CORRECT. AND YOU THINK IF YOU

02:45:29.386 --> 02:45:29.853
OWN YOUR- YOUR SCOOTER YOU

02:45:29.919 --> 02:45:30.387
SHOULD ALSO HAVE TO WEAR A

02:45:30.453 --> 02:45:35.792
HELMET. PERSONALLY YES. OKAY

02:45:35.859 --> 02:45:37.093
THIS BECAUSE MY ARMY GOT IT. I

02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:37.727
THANK YOU MY NEXT QUESTION IS

02:45:37.794 --> 02:45:39.095
FOR. THE TWO OF YOU. SO WE'VE

02:45:39.162 --> 02:45:39.663
HEARD A LOT FROM THE CITIES

02:45:39.729 --> 02:45:41.865
THAT WERE HERE ABOUT THEIR

02:45:41.931 --> 02:45:44.701
NEED. TO HAVE DATA ABOUT TRIPS.

02:45:44.768 --> 02:45:45.802
AND HAVING BEEN IN LOCAL

02:45:45.869 --> 02:45:47.537
GOVERNMENT I THINK THEY'RE

02:45:47.604 --> 02:45:48.071
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THEY

02:45:48.138 --> 02:45:50.573
CAN'T PLAN. SCOOTERS THEY CAN'T

02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:52.509
REGULATE THEM THEY CAN'T DO

02:45:52.575 --> 02:45:53.877
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TIE

02:45:53.943 --> 02:45:56.379
THEM IN WITH- THEIR TRANSIT AND

02:45:56.446 --> 02:45:57.914
MAKE THEM USEFUL WITHOUT HAVING

02:45:57.981 --> 02:45:59.916
VERY SPECIFIC DATA ABOUT WHERE

02:45:59.983 --> 02:46:01.084
PEOPLEARE TAKING THEM AND WHEN

02:46:01.151 --> 02:46:02.485
THEY'RE USING THEM. AND YET YOU

02:46:02.552 --> 02:46:05.322
HAVE FOUGHT THE EFFORTS FOR ME

02:46:05.388 --> 02:46:06.956
AND FROM OTHERS TO HAVE THAT

02:46:07.023 --> 02:46:08.758
KIND OF DATA PROVIDED TO THE

02:46:08.825 --> 02:46:10.827
CITIES. SO WHERE IS THAT LINE

02:46:10.894 --> 02:46:12.495
FOR YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK IS

02:46:12.562 --> 02:46:14.064
REASONABLE TO BE SHARED WITH

02:46:14.130 --> 02:46:16.266
THE CITIES. OF WHO RIGHT NOW

02:46:16.333 --> 02:46:17.334
ARE UNABLE TO DO THE PLANNING

02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:20.103
THAT THEY NEED TO DO- TO MAKE

02:46:20.170 --> 02:46:22.205
THAT TEIR CONGESTION BETTER TO

02:46:22.272 --> 02:46:23.973
TIE THEIR TRANSPORTATION AND

02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:26.042
WITH. WITH WHAT YOU SAY IS

02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:27.477
SUPPOSED TO BE THE USE OF YOUR

02:46:27.544 --> 02:46:29.245
PRODUCT WHICH IS TO SOLVE FIRST

02:46:29.312 --> 02:46:30.313
MILE LAST MILE TO SOLVE

02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:32.315
TRANSPORTATION. THERE'D BE

02:46:32.382 --> 02:46:33.783
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET THAT

02:46:33.850 --> 02:46:36.119
DATA. ARE FROM YOU INCIDENT

02:46:36.186 --> 02:46:38.855
LARGE CITIES MIGHT BE ABLE TO.

02:46:38.922 --> 02:46:41.891
TO LEVERAGE- GETTING THE DATA

02:46:41.958 --> 02:46:42.992
FROM YOU ON THEIR OWN BUT THE

02:46:43.059 --> 02:46:44.427
SMALLER CITIES CANNULAS HELL NO

02:46:44.494 --> 02:46:45.428
WE'RE NOT GIVING IT YOU WOULD

02:46:45.495 --> 02:46:46.930
JUST ONE OPERATE. SO WHAT IS

02:46:46.996 --> 02:46:48.331
THE LINE FOR YOU HOW MUCH DATA

02:46:48.398 --> 02:46:49.799
SHOULD YOU BE REQUIRED UNDER

02:46:49.866 --> 02:46:51.334
THE LAW TO PROVIDE TO THE TUNE

02:46:51.401 --> 02:46:53.269
TO ME TOO FOR CITIES TO BE ABLE

02:46:53.336 --> 02:46:58.508
TO REGULATE PROPERLY. AND TO-

02:46:58.575 --> 02:46:59.008
GET THE BEST OUT OF YOUR

02:46:59.075 --> 02:47:02.645
SERVICE AS POSSIBLE. THANK

02:47:02.712 --> 02:47:03.279
HANK YOU SIMPLY WOMAN- I THINK

02:47:03.346 --> 02:47:04.047
IT WAS PROFESSOR BUT TO SAY

02:47:04.114 --> 02:47:04.614
THAT MENTIONED THAT SEVERAL

02:47:04.681 --> 02:47:05.949
OTHER STATES HAD ALREADY

02:47:06.015 --> 02:47:07.484
DRAFTED THIS- OUT OF KIND OF

02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:08.952
SHOW FRAMEWORK. AND PROUD TO

02:47:09.018 --> 02:47:10.320
SAY THAT THAT WAS WITH A LOT OF

02:47:10.387 --> 02:47:11.955
INPUT FROM US AS TO WHAT THE

02:47:12.021 --> 02:47:13.456
APPROPRIATE LINE SHOULD BE TO

02:47:13.523 --> 02:47:14.157
WHAT IS WHAT IS THE LINE

02:47:14.224 --> 02:47:15.158
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

02:47:15.225 --> 02:47:17.026
YOU ON. FOR A YEAR NOW ON THIS

02:47:17.093 --> 02:47:17.961
AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT FROM

02:47:18.027 --> 02:47:20.263
YOU I'VE GOTTEN AS- A LOT OF-

02:47:20.330 --> 02:47:21.631
CONCERN FROM YOUR TECH

02:47:21.698 --> 02:47:23.933
COMPANIES. ABOUT PRIVACY WHICH

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.002
IS A LITTLE BIT IRONIC- BUT%

02:47:26.069 --> 02:47:26.836
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING

02:47:26.903 --> 02:47:28.505
A LOT OF THAT WITH YOU KNOW

02:47:28.571 --> 02:47:29.105
CITIES HAVE NO RIGHT TO HAVE

02:47:29.172 --> 02:47:30.440
ANY OF THIS AND THEY- THEY

02:47:30.507 --> 02:47:31.908
COULD. DO SOMETHING VERY

02:47:31.975 --> 02:47:33.476
NEFARIOUS IF THEY HAD THE DATA

02:47:33.543 --> 02:47:34.744
AND YET WE HAVE CITIES TELLING

02:47:34.811 --> 02:47:36.513
US. THAT THEY CAN'T SOLVE ALL

02:47:36.579 --> 02:47:37.347
THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:47:37.414 --> 02:47:38.882
ABOUT WITH THE DATA SO I'D I'D

02:47:38.948 --> 02:47:40.250
LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU WHAT IS

02:47:40.316 --> 02:47:41.851
THAT BRIGHT WHAT IS THAT LINE.

02:47:41.918 --> 02:47:43.253
I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

02:47:43.319 --> 02:47:44.421
THE BRIGHT LINE IS THAT CITIES

02:47:44.487 --> 02:47:46.089
ABSOLUTELY HAVE A RIGHT TO THE

02:47:46.156 --> 02:47:47.390
DATA FROM OUR DEVICES ON THEIR

02:47:47.457 --> 02:47:49.692
STREETS. AT THE SAME TIME OF

02:47:49.759 --> 02:47:50.727
COURSE THERE ARE PRIVACY

02:47:50.794 --> 02:47:52.328
CONSIDERATIONS THAT RELATE FROM

02:47:52.395 --> 02:47:53.530
OUR WRITERS AND THE DEVICES

02:47:53.596 --> 02:47:54.998
THAT THEY WRITE ON. BUT THAT

02:47:55.064 --> 02:47:56.399
THAT THOSE TWO GOALS ARE NOT

02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:58.134
INCOMPATIBLE IN THAT WITH THE

02:47:58.201 --> 02:47:59.402
APPROPRIATE DATA PRIVACY

02:47:59.469 --> 02:48:00.537
GOVERNANCE STANDARDS THAT IS TO

02:48:00.603 --> 02:48:01.871
SAY ONCE THE CITY RECEIVES THE

02:48:01.938 --> 02:48:03.773
DATA THEY ARE SUBJECT TO SOME

02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:04.908
OF THE SAME DATA PRIVACY

02:48:04.974 --> 02:48:08.244
CENTERS THAT WE ARE. THAT WE

02:48:08.311 --> 02:48:08.845
DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH THAT

02:48:08.912 --> 02:48:11.381
KIND OF THAT LEVEL DATA SHARING.

02:48:11.448 --> 02:48:11.948
YES WE WOULD ECHO THAT TRIP

02:48:12.015 --> 02:48:12.849
DATA IS PERSONAL DATA. WE DRAW

02:48:12.916 --> 02:48:13.550
THE LINE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE

02:48:13.616 --> 02:48:14.584
DATA BEING SURE THAT'S

02:48:14.651 --> 02:48:16.686
ANONYMIZED AN AGGREGATED. AND

02:48:16.753 --> 02:48:17.687
THAT CAN SOLVE ALL OF THE

02:48:17.754 --> 02:48:18.855
THINGS THAT GOVERNMENT WANTS TO

02:48:18.922 --> 02:48:20.056
DO ALL THE LEGITIMATE

02:48:20.123 --> 02:48:21.925
REGULATORY GOALS. THIS IS NOT

02:48:21.991 --> 02:48:23.126
TO STOP THOSE LEGITIMATE

02:48:23.193 --> 02:48:24.561
REGULATORY GOALS IS TO PROTECT

02:48:24.627 --> 02:48:26.095
DATA PRIVACY. PRESS CONSUMER

02:48:26.162 --> 02:48:27.664
PRIVACY WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY

02:48:27.730 --> 02:48:29.032
TO DO THAT UNDER THE LAW. WHAT

02:48:29.098 --> 02:48:29.966
ABOUT THE DATA OF WHERE THE

02:48:30.033 --> 02:48:31.234
SCOOTERS ARE WHEN THERE'S NO

02:48:31.301 --> 02:48:32.735
ONE ON IT. TO THE PEOPLE TO BE

02:48:32.802 --> 02:48:34.370
ENTITLED TO. THAT OF ALL TIME

02:48:34.437 --> 02:48:35.638
SO THAT THEY KNOW WHERE ALL

02:48:35.705 --> 02:48:38.775
YOUR SCOOTERS ARE- THEY KNOW IF

02:48:38.842 --> 02:48:39.609
THEY'RE BLOCKING THE DRIVEWAY

02:48:39.676 --> 02:48:42.078
OR HANDICAP SPOT. YES THERE'S A

02:48:42.145 --> 02:48:43.012
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRIP DATA

02:48:43.079 --> 02:48:45.014
AND DEVICE DADDO. DEVICE THAT

02:48:45.081 --> 02:48:46.449
IS THE OPERATIONAL DATA THAT

02:48:46.516 --> 02:48:48.184
WOULD ALLOW CITIES TO COMPLETE

02:48:48.251 --> 02:48:50.053
THE REGULATORY MISSIONS. TO SEE

02:48:50.119 --> 02:48:52.388
WHAT IS IN THEIR- JURISDICTION.

02:48:52.455 --> 02:48:55.291
MEET OUR REGULATORY CAPS THINGS-LIKE THAT. THE AGGREGATE BUT

02:48:55.358 --> 02:48:56.860
NOT AGGREGATED SO MUCH THAT

02:48:56.926 --> 02:48:58.795
THEY DON'T KNOW. EXACTLY WHERE

02:48:58.862 --> 02:49:00.163
THEY'RE GOING. AND SORT OF WHEN

02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:01.798
THEY'RE GOING RIGHT. CORRECT

02:49:01.865 --> 02:49:02.765
THE WEEKEND IS A LIGHTLY

02:49:02.832 --> 02:49:04.334
AGGREGATED DATA. LATELY

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:05.935
AGGREGATE LIGHTLY AGGREGATED

LOOKING AT IN ISSUE IN REGARDS

02:50:27.717 --> 02:50:30.653
TO LIABILITY AND I THINK

02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:31.254
THAT'S- GOING TO BE AN ONGOING

02:50:31.321 --> 02:50:33.222
CONCERN ESPECIALLY AT THAT.

02:50:33.289 --> 02:50:35.558
ARTIFICIALLY LOW THRESHOLD

02:50:35.625 --> 02:50:36.726
RIGHT UNDERSTAND THAT MAY BE

02:50:36.793 --> 02:50:38.962
GOOD FOR THE COMPANY BUT- THERE

02:50:39.028 --> 02:50:40.330
ARE GONNA BE CHALLENGES FOR THE

02:50:40.396 --> 02:50:40.964
CONSUMERS AND THAT'S AN ISSUE

02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:42.332
THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE

02:50:42.398 --> 02:50:43.833
ABLE TO WORK OUT- AS WE MOVE

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:46.235
FORWARD. CLICK BACK TO WHERE-

02:50:46.302 --> 02:50:47.537
AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO A DEEP

02:50:47.604 --> 02:50:49.572
DIVE ON THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE. A

02:50:49.639 --> 02:50:52.875
DATE A HEARING COMING UP. AFTER

02:50:52.942 --> 02:50:55.478
THE FIRST PART OF THE YEAR. BUT

02:50:55.545 --> 02:50:56.879
I WANT TO GO BACK TO WHERE THE

02:50:56.946 --> 02:50:58.514
GENERAL MANAGER FROM. LOS

ANGELES. WAS AT. I IN REGARDS

02:51:02.518 --> 02:51:07.056
TO SIX POINTS. AND ON. THE

02:51:07.123 --> 02:51:11.828
INDIVIDUAL- TRIP. BECAME TWENTY

02:51:11.894 --> 02:51:12.428
FOUR HOURS AFTER THE TRIP WAS

02:51:12.495 --> 02:51:16.699
COMPLETED. IS THAT AN ISSUE. ON

02:51:16.766 --> 02:51:18.067
THE SIX POINTED SHOULD MENTION

02:51:18.134 --> 02:51:19.869
I THINK THAT LOOK- UNDERSTAND

02:51:19.936 --> 02:51:22.105
WE ALL ANT TO BE ABLE TO GO IN

02:51:22.171 --> 02:51:23.906
TO BE TO PROTECT PRIVACY RIGHT

02:51:23.973 --> 02:51:25.408
AND OBVIOUSLY THERE NEED TO BE

02:51:25.475 --> 02:51:27.510
SOME TYPE OF PRIVACY AGREEMENT

02:51:27.577 --> 02:51:28.845
AS THERE ARE NOW RIGHT SO IT'S

02:51:28.911 --> 02:51:31.814
NOT TO BE- OUT IN THE PUBLIC.

02:51:31.881 --> 02:51:35.652
SPHERE BUT ALSO TRYING TO BE

02:51:35.718 --> 02:51:36.185
ABLE TO ASSIST CITY SO. ON

02:51:36.252 --> 02:51:38.588
THOSE SIX POINTS. THAT YOU

HEARD TODAY. THAT SEEM

02:51:39.822 --> 02:51:41.791
REASONABLE SINCE IT'S ALREADY

02:51:41.858 --> 02:51:46.329
IN UNDER AGREEMENT ANYWAY. IT

02:51:46.396 --> 02:51:47.730
DOES I IN I THINK THAT WHAT

02:51:47.797 --> 02:51:49.565
PART OF THE- PART OF IN MY

02:51:49.632 --> 02:51:50.767
RESPONSE TO US TO ASSEMBLY

02:51:50.833 --> 02:51:52.635
MEMBER FRIEDMAN'S EMPHASIS WAS

02:51:52.702 --> 02:51:53.770
THAT WE CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO

02:51:53.836 --> 02:51:55.271
THE DATA AFTER THE CITY GETS

02:51:55.338 --> 02:51:56.639
THE AFTER THE CITY GETS IT IS

02:51:56.706 --> 02:51:58.841
IT- SUBSTITUTE IS THIS

02:51:58.908 --> 02:51:59.909
SOMETHING THAT IS PROTECTED IS

02:51:59.976 --> 02:52:01.277
A SOMETHING THE SUBJECT TO FOIL

02:52:01.344 --> 02:52:03.112
OR OPEN RECORDS REQUESTS OR IS

02:52:03.179 --> 02:52:03.613
THIS SOMETHING THAT IS

02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:04.647
ESSENTIALLY AT AS ESSENTIALLY

02:52:04.714 --> 02:52:05.581
UNPROTECTED.WE'VE

02:52:05.648 --> 02:52:06.649
UNFORTUNATELY HAD NEGATIVE

02:52:06.716 --> 02:52:08.051
EXPERIENCES WITH OTHER CITIES

02:52:08.117 --> 02:52:08.885
NONE OF THE CITIES ON THIS

02:52:08.951 --> 02:52:10.953
PANEL OF COURSE IT HAD NATIVE

02:52:11.020 --> 02:52:11.954
EXPENSES ELSEWHERE AND THAT'S

02:52:12.021 --> 02:52:14.057
OUR PRIMARY FOCUSED CAN I GET

02:52:14.123 --> 02:52:15.358
AND I AND I GUESS I DON'T SEE

02:52:15.425 --> 02:52:16.759
WHY IT CAN'T BE TREATED LIKE

02:52:16.826 --> 02:52:18.294
FOR EXAMPLE CITY STREET BED TAX

02:52:18.361 --> 02:52:20.229
FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT. SO BY TAX IS

02:52:20.296 --> 02:52:21.898
NOT UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS

02:52:21.964 --> 02:52:24.300
ACT REQUEST YOU CAN'T REQUESTED

02:52:24.367 --> 02:52:25.835
BY CITIES GIVE IT OUT AS ONE

02:52:25.902 --> 02:52:28.337
LARGE TOTAL ON A QUARTERLY

02:52:28.404 --> 02:52:29.739
BASIS FOREVER THEY REPORTED BUT

02:52:29.806 --> 02:52:33.443
THEY DON'T. GO INDIVIDUAL BY

02:52:33.509 --> 02:52:37.480
INDIVIDUAL SO I. I JUST KNOW

02:52:37.547 --> 02:52:38.081
THERE'S A SWEET SPOT IN THERE

02:52:38.147 --> 02:52:38.948
TO BE ABLE TO. FIGURE THAT OUT.

02:52:39.015 --> 02:52:39.549

SELF REGULATION WHICH I THINK-WAS. A DISCUSSED EARLIER AND

02:52:46.322 --> 02:52:47.724
THEN WHERE WE'RE AT WITH REAL

02:52:47.790 --> 02:52:48.324
TIME TRIP INFORMATION I THINK

02:52:48.391 --> 02:52:50.193
THERE'S A NICE MIDDLE GROUND.

02:52:50.259 --> 02:52:51.394
IN THERE WERE WERE ABLE TO

02:52:51.461 --> 02:52:52.995

02:52:53.062 --> 02:52:54.030
WE'VE DISCUSSED TODAY THAT WE

02:52:54.097 --> 02:52:56.132
SUPPORT- BUT THEN DO IT IN A

02:52:56.199 --> 02:52:57.834
WAY THAT'S PRIVACY PROTECTED

02:52:57.900 --> 02:52:58.801
THAT'S AGGREGATED THAT'S

02:52:58.868 --> 02:53:01.104
ANONYMIZE AND WE CAN AND JUST

02:53:01.170 --> 02:53:02.171

02:53:02.238 --> 02:53:03.106
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT

02:53:03.172 --> 02:53:05.475

02:53:41.277 --> 02:53:43.312
FRONT- WE MEET ALL OF THE YOU

02:53:43.379 --> 02:53:46.182

EXIST ON THE MARKET TODAY. I

02:54:04.567 --> 02:54:05.067
WOULD FLAG THAT IS A CONCERN

02:54:05.134 --> 02:54:07.804
AND ANOTHER ONE IS. ARE THE

02:54:07.870 --> 02:54:09.272
MECHANISMS THAT LIKE IT WHAT'S

02:54:09.338 --> 02:54:10.840
IN THE BILL IS THAT ACTUALLY

02:54:10.907 --> 02:54:12.074
LEAING THE CONCERN THAT YOU

02:54:12.141 --> 02:54:14.210
HAVE SO LOOKING AT WHAT THE

02:54:14.277 --> 02:54:17.213
GOALS ARE SO WE HAVE A REALLY

02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:17.847
BROAD COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE WE

02:54:17.914 --> 02:54:20.116
HAVE A TEN MILLION DOLLAR. GET

02:54:20.183 --> 02:54:21.617
LIMIT WE HAVE A FIVE MILLION

02:54:21.684 --> 02:54:22.885
DOLLAR PER CURRENTS LIMIT THAT

02:54:22.952 --> 02:54:24.954
MEETS. THE RIVER ON MANY OF

02:54:25.021 --> 02:54:25.755
THEIR BOB. ENTRANCE

02:54:25.822 --> 02:54:27.056
REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU HEARD

02:54:27.123 --> 02:54:28.791
TODAY- AND SO WE JUST DON'T

02:54:28.858 --> 02:54:30.927
WANT TO GET. TO WHERE WERE KIND

02:54:30.993 --> 02:54:32.695
OF SO BOXED IN THAT WERE IN

02:54:32.762 --> 02:54:34.230
KIND OF MISSING WHAT THE GOALS

02:54:34.297 --> 02:54:35.698
OF WHAT THE REGULATIONS TRYING

02:54:35.765 --> 02:54:37.934
TO ACCOMPLISH. DO YOU BELIEVE-

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:39.535
THERE'S A COMMENT MADE THAT IF

02:54:39.602 --> 02:54:41.037
THERE WAS SAID AS STATEWIDE

02:54:41.103 --> 02:54:42.605
STANDARD RIGHT I THAT THAT

02:54:42.672 --> 02:54:43.940
WOULD ACTUALLY ASSIST IN

02:54:44.006 --> 02:54:45.775
REGARDS TO THE NUMBER. OF

02:54:45.842 --> 02:54:47.376
COMPANIES THAT WERE OFFERING

02:54:47.443 --> 02:54:49.545
INSURANCE AS WELL YOU WANT TO

02:54:49.612 --> 02:54:51.247
COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE- IN AND

02:54:51.314 --> 02:54:52.315
I'M GOING TO PARAPHRASE HERE

02:54:52.381 --> 02:54:52.949
AND WANT TO PUT WORDS INTO THE

02:54:53.015 --> 02:54:55.117
INDIVIDUALS MOUTH BUT- IT. THE

02:54:55.184 --> 02:54:57.386
COMMENT WAS THAT IF WE LOOK AT

02:54:57.453 --> 02:54:58.187
A STATEWIDE STANDARD THAT MAY

02:54:58.254 --> 02:55:00.923
BECOME. MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY

02:55:00.990 --> 02:55:02.024
FOR OTHER COMPANIES APPEAR TO

02:55:02.091 --> 02:55:04.093
GET IN VERSES OUT ONE INSURANCE

02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:05.394
CARRIER AND IT CAN BE VERY

02:55:05.461 --> 02:55:09.632
EXPENSIVE CAN YOU CAN. COME IN

02:55:09.699 --> 02:55:10.233
ON THE ACT. BUT YOU HEARD FROM

02:55:10.299 --> 02:55:12.802
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I TINK

02:55:12.869 --> 02:55:14.303
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY LIKELY TO BE

02:55:14.370 --> 02:55:14.837
THE CASE A FEW STATES HAVE

02:55:14.904 --> 02:55:16.038
ALREADY PASSED SUCH IT SUCH

02:55:16.105 --> 02:55:16.472
STATEWIDE INSURANCE

02:55:16.539 --> 02:55:17.073
REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVEN'T SEEN

02:55:17.139 --> 02:55:18.140
AGREE UP TO GET ONE FROM THE

02:55:18.207 --> 02:55:19.342
INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT IT IS

02:55:19.408 --> 02:55:20.743
SOMETHING THAT WE THAT WE KNOW

02:55:20.810 --> 02:55:22.845
THAT THERE ARE. OTHERS ACTIVELY

02:55:22.912 --> 02:55:23.446
LOOKING TO GET INTO THE SPACE

02:55:23.512 --> 02:55:27.984
AS WELL. SORRY THAT THE ONLY

02:55:28.050 --> 02:55:29.252
OTHER THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT

02:55:29.318 --> 02:55:30.586
AS AS IS THE CASE FOR MOST.

02:55:30.653 --> 02:55:32.255
MOST COMPANIES IT'S NOT THAT WE

02:55:32.321 --> 02:55:33.222
HAVE A SEPARATE INSURANCE

02:55:45.067 --> 02:55:47.236
REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY OTHER

GOALS YES. ARE LAUDABLE AND

02:56:03.252 --> 02:56:04.854
WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED

02:56:04.921 --> 02:56:05.821
TO SEE REGULATION BUT WE'RE NOT

02:56:05.888 --> 02:56:09.191
TRYING TO PREEMPT. LOCALS FROM

02:56:11.227 --> 02:56:13.062
POINT. IS MIDDLE. THANK YOU WE

02:56:13.129 --> 02:56:14.263
HEARD THE SAME ARGUMENT DURING

02:56:14.330 --> 02:56:15.765
THE TNC IS AN INSURANCE

02:56:15.831 --> 02:56:18.067
COMMISSIONER DAVE JONES- THEN

02:56:18.134 --> 02:56:18.935
WORK WITH THE INSURANCE

NEW MARKET OF INSURANCE.

02:56:22.071 --> 02:56:22.738

02:56:26.409 --> 02:56:27.543
TO PERSONS WERE USING IT WITH

02:56:27.610 --> 02:56:29.078
THEIR OWN VEHICLES. THERE WAS

02:56:29.145 --> 02:56:31.447
NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING

DRIVERS. I DON'T SEE THAT THERE

02:56:37.186 --> 02:56:40.056
WOULD BE SUCH A DIFFICULTY NOW

02:56:40.122 --> 02:56:40.589

FOLLOW. PLEASE IF I COULD I

02:56:45.161 --> 02:56:46.829
THINK THERE IS THE VERY SLIGHT

02:56:46.896 --> 02:56:48.297
DIFFERENCE IS SIMPLY THAT CAR

CHALLENGE FOR US AS IS AS IS AS

THE POWER GRID OF FOUR USES I

02:57:48.324 --> 02:57:50.026
WE'VE WE'VE UNLOCKED- AS AN

02:57:50.092 --> 02:57:51.761

WHERE THEY NEED TO BE IS- AS AS

02:57:56.499 --> 02:57:57.533
A POTENTIAL OPTION BUT

02:57:57.600 --> 02:57:59.101
CERTAINLY YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE

WILD FIRES OF AFFECTED SERVICE

02:58:09.111 --> 02:58:10.713
OTHER THAN WE HAVE DONE SAFETY

02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:12.548

FIRES ARE HAPPENING- BUT NOT

02:58:19.588 --> 02:58:21.490
SURE ABOUT THAT AND- THE-

02:58:21.557 --> 02:58:24.527
IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR POWER GRAD

02:58:24.593 --> 02:58:25.061
CHARGING AT OPERATIONS AND

02:58:25.127 --> 02:58:27.229
THINGS LIKE THAT. I WOULD JUST

02:58:27.296 --> 02:58:29.698
BE CURIOUS ON HOW MUCH. OF

02:58:29.765 --> 02:58:31.434
PEOPLE THAT RELY ON THEM ON A

02:58:31.500 --> 02:58:34.336
DAILY BASIS- HAVE BEEN AFFECTED

02:58:34.403 --> 02:58:36.972
AND HOW. ARE YOU THE REDUCTION

02:58:37.039 --> 02:58:39.275

CLOSING COMMENTS AS WELL. CAN

02:58:54.657 --> 02:58:57.059
WE GO BACK SO- HE HE ALL

02:58:57.126 --> 02:58:58.828
COMMENTED ON ISSUES IN REGARDS

02:58:58.894 --> 02:59:01.130
TO PC FEES AND LOCAL FEES AS

02:59:01.197 --> 02:59:04.700
WELL. I THINK THAT IT IS A REAL

02:59:04.767 --> 02:59:06.602
CHALLENGE IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN

02:59:06.669 --> 02:59:07.703
LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMING FROM

02:59:07.770 --> 02:59:09.505
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TRYING TO

02:59:09.572 --> 02:59:11.173
RECOUP THE COSTS THAT IT TAKES

02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:11.674
TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE

02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:14.443
PROGRAM. SO WALK US THROUGH

02:59:14.510 --> 02:59:17.847
THAT ONE MORE TIME- IF YOU

02:59:17.913 --> 02:59:18.814
DON'T MIND THAT BECAUSE I THINK

02:59:18.881 --> 02:59:21.250
WITH THE CHALLENGES. OF LOCAL

02:59:21.317 --> 02:59:22.151
GOVERNMENT JUST COULD BE CANTON

02:59:22.218 --> 02:59:24.587
I'LL GIVE YOU MY OWN EDITORIAL.

02:59:24.653 --> 02:59:25.387
I THINK THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:59:25.454 --> 02:59:27.990
COMMISSION IS SWAMPED. I THINK

02:59:28.057 --> 02:59:30.159
THAT- TO SAY THE LEAST. THEY

02:59:30.226 --> 02:59:31.293
NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME

02:59:31.360 --> 02:59:32.695
REGULATING P. JEANNIE LESS TIME

02:59:32.761 --> 02:59:34.096
ON THIS AND THAT THE LOCALS TO

02:59:34.163 --> 02:59:35.397
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. MY

02:59:35.464 --> 02:59:37.233
OWN OPINION WE WILL GO THERE WE

02:59:37.299 --> 02:59:41.971
WILL SURPASS RAN A CUSS JAR. SO.

02:59:42.037 --> 02:59:44.640
BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS. IF

02:59:44.707 --> 02:59:46.976
THERE COULD BE SOME ROOM.

02:59:47.042 --> 02:59:47.943
REGION GREEN OF THOSE DOLLARS

02:59:48.010 --> 02:59:48.444
THAT COULD GO TO LOCAL

02:59:48.511 --> 02:59:48.911
GOVERNMENT THAT COULD

02:59:48.978 --> 02:59:49.545
POTENTIALLY HELP THEM SINCE ARE

02:59:49.612 --> 02:59:51.313
THE ONES THAT ARE ON THE GROUND

02:59:51.380 --> 02:59:51.847
THERE REGULATING. CAN YOU

02:59:51.914 --> 02:59:52.414
COMMENT ON THAT A LITTLE BIT

02:59:52.481 --> 02:59:55.584
BECAUSE- I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT

02:59:55.651 --> 02:59:56.185
YOU ARE GETTING WHAT YOU NEED

02:59:56.252 --> 02:59:58.754
AT THIS POINT. THE P. C. ON

02:59:58.821 --> 03:00:01.090
THIS ISSUE. SOME OF OUR THANK

03:00:01.157 --> 03:00:02.825
YOU SO MUCH- I THINK THAT'S

03:00:02.892 --> 03:00:04.093
EXACTLY RIGHT THAT WE DON'T

03:00:04.160 --> 03:00:05.928
HAVE WE DON'T HAVE ANY PUBLIC

03:00:05.995 --> 03:00:06.562
WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC SUPPORT WE

03:00:06.629 --> 03:00:09.165
DON'T RELY ON IT HOWEVER AS A

03:00:09.231 --> 03:00:10.666
RESULT OF THAT AS A RESULT OF

03:00:10.733 --> 03:00:12.134
CITIES- RECOUPING THE COSTS

03:00:12.201 --> 03:00:13.936
WHICH WILL WHICH AS SOMEONE WHO

03:00:14.003 --> 03:00:15.671
HAS ALSO. HAD EXPERIENCE WITH

03:00:15.738 --> 03:00:16.972
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE I

03:00:17.039 --> 03:00:18.841
ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU

03:00:18.908 --> 03:00:19.875
CAN'T HAVE IN YET ANOTHER LARGE

03:00:19.942 --> 03:00:21.744
RED ITEM ON YOUR BUDGET. I

03:00:21.810 --> 03:00:23.078
THINK THE PROBLEM FOR US COMES

03:00:23.145 --> 03:00:24.446
IN THE FACT THAT THIS IS AN

03:00:24.513 --> 03:00:24.947
APPLIED EQUALLY ACROSS

03:00:25.014 --> 03:00:27.683
TRANSPORTATION MODES THE FEES

03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:29.685
THAT WE PAY FOR DRIVING CARS OR

03:00:29.752 --> 03:00:31.287
FOR TAKING ON TNC TRIPS OR FOR

03:00:31.353 --> 03:00:32.421
ANY OTHER MODE OF TRANSPORT

03:00:32.488 --> 03:00:33.756
DON'T REALLY COME CLOSE TO

03:00:33.822 --> 03:00:35.057
MATCHING THE COST OF ALL THE

03:00:35.124 --> 03:00:36.358
TRANSPORTATION STAFFERS THAT

03:00:36.425 --> 03:00:37.326
CITIES HIGHER THE TO THE

03:00:37.393 --> 03:00:38.460
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

03:00:38.527 --> 03:00:39.595
TRANSPORTATION AND SO ON.

03:00:39.662 --> 03:00:41.597
THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING THAT

03:00:41.664 --> 03:00:42.231
TO SOME EXTENT THIS IS

03:00:42.298 --> 03:00:43.933
SUBSIDIZED BY THE REST OF THE

03:00:43.999 --> 03:00:44.500
PUBLIC IN IN AFFORDABLE TO

03:00:44.567 --> 03:00:46.802
ALLOW ALL OF US TO GET AROUND.

03:00:46.869 --> 03:00:47.703
I THINK THAT WHAT WE SWITCH

03:00:47.770 --> 03:00:49.672
SCENE THAT I CON ME IN WHEN IT

03:00:49.738 --> 03:00:50.873
COMES TO CITIES RECOUPINGTHE

03:00:50.940 --> 03:00:52.374
COSTS COMING TO US IS THAT

03:00:52.441 --> 03:00:54.577
THOSE COSTS ARE TWENTY TO

03:00:54.643 --> 03:00:55.177
EIGHTY TIMES HIGHER THAN THE

03:00:55.244 --> 03:00:57.146
COSTS IMPOSED ON DNC'S AND THAT

03:00:57.213 --> 03:00:59.014
THIS NOT BECAUSE CITIES ARE OUT

03:00:59.081 --> 03:01:00.115
ON ARE OUT TRYING TO RAISE

03:01:00.182 --> 03:01:01.350
REVENUE OR TRYING TO EXTORT

03:01:01.417 --> 03:01:03.018
ANYBODY IT'S SIMPLY THAT WE ARE

03:01:03.085 --> 03:01:04.386
WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW MOST THAT

03:01:04.453 --> 03:01:05.821
THERE IS A- THERE'S ACTIVE

03:01:05.888 --> 03:01:06.956
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO RECOUP ALL

03:01:07.022 --> 03:01:08.791
THE COSTS. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF

03:01:08.857 --> 03:01:10.025
THE ASPECTS WERE I THINK HAVING

03:01:10.092 --> 03:01:11.126
STATE MARCIA WOULD BE MOST

03:01:11.193 --> 03:01:12.595
HELPFUL IN THAT THE STATE HAS

03:01:12.661 --> 03:01:14.029
CONTRIBUTED A LOT TOWARDS

03:01:14.096 --> 03:01:15.931
ENCOURAGING THE ADOPTION OF

03:01:15.998 --> 03:01:17.666
ZERO MISSION TRANSPORTATION AND

03:01:17.733 --> 03:01:18.601
THAT IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF

03:01:18.667 --> 03:01:22.304
THING. THAT WOULD BENEFIT MOST

03:01:22.371 --> 03:01:22.938
I THINK. FROM LOWERING THE COST

03:01:23.005 --> 03:01:28.444
UPON WRITERS. GOT IT OKAY IN I

03:01:28.510 --> 03:01:29.678
THINK THAT- I APPRECIATE AND I

03:01:29.745 --> 03:01:31.180
THINK THE ISSUE IS. ONE OF THE

03:01:31.247 --> 03:01:32.481
REASONS WHY. WE WANT TO DO THIS

03:01:32.548 --> 03:01:33.916
HEARING TODAY IS. AS WE SEEN.

03:01:33.983 --> 03:01:35.117

FACILITY FACILITATING THIS

03:08:37.973 --> 03:08:41.410
CONVERSATION- FOR LYME WE

03:08:41.476 --> 03:08:43.078
FACILITATED MORE THAN A HUNDRED

03:08:43.145 --> 03:08:44.946
MILLION RIDES AROUND THE GLOBE

03:08:45.013 --> 03:08:46.615
IN ONLY TWO YEARS- BUT WE

03:08:46.682 --> 03:08:47.649
BELIEVE THAT. SERVING CITIES

03:08:47.716 --> 03:08:49.017
RIGHT TO REGULATE SCOOTERS IS

03:08:49.084 --> 03:08:51.119
CRITICAL AND WE RECOMMEND THAT.

03:08:51.186 --> 03:08:52.688
THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND

03:08:52.754 --> 03:08:53.221
AGENCIES CAN HELP IN THE

03:08:53.288 --> 03:08:55.424
FOLLOWING WAYS. I'M STATE THE

03:08:55.490 --> 03:08:57.025
STATE AND CITIES SHOULD ENGAGE

03:08:57.092 --> 03:08:58.493
WITH OPERATORS TO SET BEST

03:08:58.560 --> 03:08:59.928
PRACTICES FOR LOCAL POLICY

03:08:59.995 --> 03:09:01.697
FRAMEWORKS- AND THE STATE

03:09:01.763 --> 03:09:02.998
SHOULD HEAVILY INVEST AND

03:09:03.065 --> 03:09:04.633
EXPEDITE FUNDS TO CITIES AND

03:09:04.700 --> 03:09:06.201
COUNTIES THAT HELP THEM BUILD

03:09:06.268 --> 03:09:08.236
OUT TRANSIT. AND PROTECTED BIKE

03:09:08.303 --> 03:09:09.337
IN FOR A BIKE LANE

03:09:09.404 --> 03:09:11.406
INFRASTRUCTURE- ADDITIONALLY

03:09:11.473 --> 03:09:13.141
LINES WORK WITH FIFTEEN ON

03:09:13.208 --> 03:09:14.342
CITIES AROUND THE STATE TO

03:09:14.409 --> 03:09:15.877
SHARE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

03:09:15.944 --> 03:09:18.146
SUCCESSFUL POLICY FRAMEWORKS-

03:09:18.213 --> 03:09:19.114
THE FIRST. START WITH A

03:09:19.181 --> 03:09:20.482
REASONABLE NUMBER OF SCOOTERS

03:09:20.549 --> 03:09:22.017
AND GROW BASED ON DEMAND AND

03:09:22.084 --> 03:09:23.285
PERFORMANCE THAT MEANS IT'S A

03:09:23.351 --> 03:09:26.054
PERFORMANCE BASED CAP- WE THINK

03:09:26.121 --> 03:09:27.823
THAT. THIS HELPS INCENTIVIZE

03:09:27.889 --> 03:09:30.759
OPERATORS AND- WITH THE FLEET

03:09:30.826 --> 03:09:32.427
TO INCREASE YOU KNOW SAFETY

03:09:32.494 --> 03:09:33.895
WORKSHOPS AND SO FORTH. I'M

03:09:33.962 --> 03:09:35.597
ALSO SUBJECT SCOOTERS TO THE

03:09:35.664 --> 03:09:38.366
SAME- RULES AS BIKES. SCOOTERS

03:09:38.433 --> 03:09:40.235
SHOULD BE ABLE TO RIDE ANYWHERE

03:09:40.302 --> 03:09:40.836
AND ANYTIME THAT A BIKE AND

03:09:40.902 --> 03:09:42.504
RIDE AND SUBJECTING SCOOTERS TO

03:09:42.571 --> 03:09:43.839
STRICTER RULES CAN CAUSE

03:09:43.905 --> 03:09:45.841
CONFUSION AMONG WRITERS. NON

03:09:45.907 --> 03:09:47.709
WRITERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:09:47.776 --> 03:09:48.844
AND ALSO MAKE SURE SCOOTERS ARE

03:09:48.910 --> 03:09:50.612
RELIABLE CITIES RIGHTFULLY

03:09:50.679 --> 03:09:52.013
WORRY ABOUT SCOOTER PARKING

03:09:52.080 --> 03:09:53.715
CLATTER. LIME EDUCATES OUR

03:09:53.782 --> 03:09:55.050
WRITERS ON PROPER PARKING

03:09:55.117 --> 03:09:56.418
ADVOCATE BUT SOME CITIES ARE

03:09:56.485 --> 03:09:58.320
MOVING TO MANDATE PARKING IN

03:09:58.386 --> 03:10:00.055
DESIGNATED CORRALS. WINDS

03:10:00.122 --> 03:10:01.723
WRITER ANALYSIS DATA SHOWS

03:10:01.790 --> 03:10:03.925
HOWEVER THAT. WITH EACH STEP

03:10:03.992 --> 03:10:05.594
ADDED WITH EACH ADDED STEP THAT

03:10:05.660 --> 03:10:07.562
A USER HAS TO WALK TO FIND A

03:10:07.629 --> 03:10:08.930
SCOOTER. THE LESS LIKELY

03:10:08.997 --> 03:10:10.398
WRITERS WILL CHOOSE THIS

03:10:10.465 --> 03:10:12.634
SCOOTER AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO A

03:10:12.701 --> 03:10:15.504
CAR. SO THE BEST APPROACH IS TO

03:10:15.570 --> 03:10:17.172
HAVE SCOOTERS PART NO MORE THAN

03:10:17.239 --> 03:10:18.974
A HUNDRED FIFTY FEET FROM ANY

03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:21.943
BUILDING. AVAILABLE THROUGH

03:10:22.010 --> 03:10:30.385
EITHER FREE FLOATING PARKING IT.

03:10:30.452 --> 03:10:31.787
IN LESS DENSE AREA OR A BUNCH

03:10:31.853 --> 03:10:32.320
PARKING SPACES IN DENSE

03:10:32.387 --> 03:10:32.921
DOWNTOWNS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO

03:10:32.988 --> 03:10:33.522
WORKING WITH THE STATE LOCAL

03:10:33.588 --> 03:10:34.022

DEVICES ON OUR STREETS- IT'S

03:10:53.441 --> 03:10:55.577
REALLY FRUSTRATING I HAVE

03:10:55.644 --> 03:10:56.144
THIRTY TWO CITIES IN MY TO

03:10:56.211 --> 03:10:58.380
COUNTY TO BAN SCOOTERS. I HAVE

03:10:58.446 --> 03:10:59.314
ONE CITY THAT'S BEEN VERY PRO

03:10:59.381 --> 03:11:01.016

03:11:02.551 --> 03:11:04.986
PROBLEM- SO ALAMEDA BANDS IN

OAKLAND IT'S PRO. BERKELEY'S

03:11:06.988 --> 03:11:08.123
READY TO DO PERMITS BUT THEY'RE

03:11:08.190 --> 03:11:09.457
WORRIED ABOUT LIABILITY EVERY

03:11:09.524 --> 03:11:10.425
THOSE THINKING ABOUT AT

03:11:10.492 --> 03:11:11.927
RICHMOND IS READY TO GO BUT

03:11:11.993 --> 03:11:13.328
THEY'RE WORRIED TOO. THIS IS

03:11:13.395 --> 03:11:15.230
RIDICULOUS WE DO NEED THE STATE

03:11:15.297 --> 03:11:18.567
TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE SOME

03:11:18.633 --> 03:11:20.735
CITIES BAD THESE THINGS. SAID

03:11:20.802 --> 03:11:22.337
OF FLOOR SET A CEILING AND

03:11:22.404 --> 03:11:23.738
LET'S WHAT THESE COMPANIES

03:11:23.805 --> 03:11:25.440
INNOVATE WORKING WITH THE

03:11:25.507 --> 03:11:26.107
CITY'S ON ALL THESE ISSUES THAT

03:11:26.174 --> 03:11:28.610
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT HERE- PLEASE

03:11:28.677 --> 03:11:30.245
PUSH TOWARDS MORE INNOVATION IN

03:11:30.312 --> 03:11:33.181
OAKLAND WHERE WE DO HAVE OW.

03:11:33.248 --> 03:11:34.382
FOR SCOOTER OPERATORS I SEE

03:11:34.449 --> 03:11:36.184
INNOVATION EVERY DAY ONE

03:11:36.251 --> 03:11:38.086
OPERATORS OUT IN A MEETING THE

03:11:38.153 --> 03:11:43.758
OTHER THAT'S. WHAT WE NEED WE

03:11:43.825 --> 03:11:44.359
NEED IT STATEWIDE AND WE NEED

03:11:44.426 --> 03:11:48.663
ANY CITY. ONE WAY YOU CAN

03:11:48.730 --> 03:11:49.397
REALLY HELP US HERE'S BETTER

03:11:49.464 --> 03:11:50.432
UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY ISSUES

03:11:50.498 --> 03:11:51.066
YOU HAD AN EXPERT HERE SAYING

03:11:51.132 --> 03:11:52.100
I'M GIVING YOU A VERY LIMITED

03:11:52.167 --> 03:11:52.868
SET OF DATA FROM THREE CITIES.

03:11:52.934 --> 03:11:53.902
ON THIS VERY ISSUE THAT YOU.

03:11:53.969 --> 03:11:55.537
ASKED ME TO TALK ABOUT THAT'S

03:11:55.604 --> 03:11:56.905
BAD DATA WHY DON'T WE HAVE

03:11:56.972 --> 03:11:58.306
BETTER DATA SO I THINK THE

03:11:58.373 --> 03:11:59.574
STATE CAN STEP IN FUND THIS

03:11:59.641 --> 03:12:01.676
RESEARCH. MAKE IT HAPPENS WHEN

03:12:01.743 --> 03:12:03.345
SOMEBODY GETS APPEARANCE AS

03:12:03.411 --> 03:12:05.247
HERE'S THE SAFETY CONCERN I

03:12:05.313 --> 03:12:06.281
HAVE WE HAVE REAL DATA THAT

03:12:06.348 --> 03:12:09.017
BACK TO THE- ON LIABILITY IN

03:12:09.084 --> 03:12:10.018
INSURANCE I THINK THE STATE

03:12:10.085 --> 03:12:11.686
DOES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY. I

03:12:11.753 --> 03:12:12.320
THINK THE STATE HAS A ROLE TO

03:12:12.387 --> 03:12:15.023
PLAY ON MAXIMUM. LIABILITY

03:12:15.090 --> 03:12:17.392
ISSUES OAKLAND HAS A PROVISION

03:12:17.459 --> 03:12:19.127
WHERE THEY REQUIRE THE MOBILITY

03:12:19.194 --> 03:12:21.663
OPERATORS TO INDEMNIFY THE CITY

03:12:21.730 --> 03:12:25.634
OF OAKLAND FOR THE CITY'S OWN

03:12:25.700 --> 03:12:26.735
DESIGN AND TO ME THAT'S WHAT IF

03:12:26.801 --> 03:12:28.203
THAT'S OFFENSIVE AS A BIKE

03:12:28.270 --> 03:12:30.805
ADVOCATE THAT. ANY CITY CAN GET

03:12:30.872 --> 03:12:32.040
AWAY WITH THAT. THE STATE

03:12:32.107 --> 03:12:32.641
SHOULD NOT ALLOW CITIES TO DO

03:12:32.707 --> 03:12:34.910
THAT- FINALLY. WHAT MORE

03:12:34.976 --> 03:12:36.244
CONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE

03:12:36.311 --> 03:12:38.046
CITIES WE NEED THAT WE ALSO

03:12:38.113 --> 03:12:40.215
NEED MORE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN

03:12:40.282 --> 03:12:41.283
THE MODES I THINK A LOT OF

03:12:41.349 --> 03:12:43.752
PEOPLE LOOK AT. MIKE WILL BUILT

03:12:43.818 --> 03:12:45.420
E. AS HOLDING IT TO A HIGHER

03:12:45.487 --> 03:12:48.089
STANDARD. AND SO AS YOU DID. AS

03:12:48.156 --> 03:12:49.424
YOU DISCUSS HOW TO REGULATE

03:12:49.491 --> 03:12:51.459
MIKE MOBILITY. ASK HOW'RE WE'D

03:12:51.526 --> 03:12:53.561
REGULATING SIMILAR OTHER MODES

03:12:53.628 --> 03:12:54.663
OF TRANSPORTATION DO WE

03:12:54.729 --> 03:12:56.665
REGULATE CARS THIS WAY DO WE

03:12:56.731 --> 03:12:58.266
REGULATE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

03:12:58.333 --> 03:13:00.235
THIS WAY. DO WE REGULATE

03:13:00.302 --> 03:13:01.369
RAILROADS AND AIRLINES THIS

03:13:01.436 --> 03:13:03.505
WAY. SO LET'S HOLD ALL OF THESE

03:13:03.571 --> 03:13:05.407
MOBILITY OPTIONS TO THE SAME

03:13:05.473 --> 03:13:06.675

BLANCA CASTRO ON ADVOCACY

03:13:14.316 --> 03:13:17.519
MANAGER WITH A RP CALIFORNIA WE

03:13:17.585 --> 03:13:18.653
REPRESENT ABOUT THREE POINT

03:13:18.720 --> 03:13:19.387
THREE MILLION MEMBERS AND I'M

03:13:19.454 --> 03:13:22.190
HERE TO. JUST REMIND THE

03:13:22.257 --> 03:13:24.326
COMMITTEE THAT- OLDER ADULTS

03:13:24.392 --> 03:13:25.593
ARE NOT A HOMOGENEOUS

03:13:25.660 --> 03:13:29.030
POPULATION- THERE ARE MANY

03:13:29.097 --> 03:13:30.031
TYPES OF MOBILITY IS THAT

03:13:30.098 --> 03:13:32.667
PEOPLE OF ON. FIFTEEN OVER ARE

03:13:32.734 --> 03:13:35.203
LOOKING FOR. THE SCOOTERS IS

03:13:35.270 --> 03:13:36.304
ONE OF THEM E. BIKES IS ONE OF

03:13:36.371 --> 03:13:37.706
THEM YES BUT WALKING IS

03:13:37.772 --> 03:13:44.179
ANOTHER. AND SO THESE ARE. A

03:13:44.245 --> 03:13:44.746
FEW OF OUR CONCERNS FIRST OF

03:13:44.813 --> 03:13:52.220
ALL. WE DO SUPPORT SHARE DATA

03:13:52.287 --> 03:13:53.521
WITH LOCALITIES. AND THE SHARED

03:13:53.588 --> 03:13:54.556
MOBILITY- COMPANIES RECOGNIZING

03:13:54.622 --> 03:13:55.357
THAT THERE HAS TO BE PERSONAL

03:13:55.423 --> 03:13:55.924
PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT IS

03:13:55.991 --> 03:13:56.491
PROTECTED. BY THE SAME TOKEN

03:13:56.558 --> 03:13:57.459
THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN

03:13:57.525 --> 03:13:58.760
THE OPTION OF PUBLIC

03:13:58.827 --> 03:14:00.595
TRANSPORTATION NEED TO COME

03:14:00.662 --> 03:14:03.231
INTO PLAY AND WITHOUT THE DATA.

03:14:03.298 --> 03:14:04.299
AND THIS IS WHERE WE THINK THE

03:14:04.366 --> 03:14:07.535
STATE CAN COMMAND. IS SETTING

03:14:07.602 --> 03:14:08.069
THAT STANDARD EVEN IF ITS

03:14:08.136 --> 03:14:10.972
MINIMUM STANDARD. AND WHAT WE

03:14:11.039 --> 03:14:12.374
REALLY WERE FRUSTRATED WITH

03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:14.342
THIS JUSTICE HERE WITH THE

03:14:14.409 --> 03:14:16.044
CONFUSION OF THE BILL AND THE

03:14:16.111 --> 03:14:18.246
LANGUAGE SO REALLY JUST MAKING

03:14:18.313 --> 03:14:20.215
IT VERY SIMPLE BUT THEY JUST

03:14:20.281 --> 03:14:22.550

03:27:04.512 --> 03:27:06.213
REASON WHY WE WANTED TO TAKE A

THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT APPROACHES

03:27:06.914 --> 03:27:08.582

WE ALLOW THIS TO GET GOING. AND

03:27:20.327 --> 03:27:21.896
THEN WE SAW CHALLENGES AND WE

03:27:21.962 --> 03:27:23.197
TRY TO BRING IT BACK. WHAT WE

03:27:23.264 --> 03:27:24.465
WANTED TO BE REDUCES TO THIS

03:27:24.532 --> 03:27:27.067
RIGHT. PRIOR TO A INDUSTRY
