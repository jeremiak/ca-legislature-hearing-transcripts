ANY TIME OFF WITHOUT ANY HEALTH

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:55.911

PANDEMIC THERE WAS A HUGE

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:22.164

RECOMMENDATIONS ON CREATING A

01:41:35.856 --> 01:41:38.125
UNIFIED RATE STRUCTURE. TODAY

01:41:38.192 --> 01:41:39.593
THERE IS THE REGIONAL MARKET

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.195
RATES AND THE STANDARD

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:43.063
REIMBURSEMENT RATE. AND THOSE

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:45.866
RATES ARE HE DIDN'T NEED TO HAVE

01:41:45.933 --> 01:41:46.366
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:49.470
STRUCTURES BASED ON. THE TYPE

01:41:49.536 --> 01:41:52.005
OF. THAT PROGRAM IS BEING

01:41:52.072 --> 01:41:54.074

THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE

01:42:02.549 --> 01:42:03.984
STRUCTURE. THE STANDARD

01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:06.153
REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURE IS

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:08.188
FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONTRACTED. TO

THESE PER AT PROGRAM. AND SO

01:42:13.827 --> 01:42:15.295
PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF

01:42:15.362 --> 01:42:17.698
THE WORKGROUP ARE TO CREATE ONE.

01:42:17.764 --> 01:42:19.700
UNIFIED RATE STRUCTURE I

01:42:19.766 --> 01:42:22.803
WITNESSED AT THE ENTIRETY OF A

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:24.872
PROGRAMS BETTER AGAIN.

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:26.773
SUPPORTING AT. BUT OUR LOW

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.509
INCOME BETTER ELIGIBLE FOR

01:42:28.575 --> 01:42:30.611
SUBSIDIES AND WHAT THAT. WOULD

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:32.579
LOOK LIKE. IN ADDITION TO THAT

01:42:32.646 --> 01:42:34.348
UNIFIED RATE STRUCTURE THERE'S

01:42:34.414 --> 01:42:35.415
ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

01:42:35.482 --> 01:42:38.585
RELATED TO HOW WE ESTABLISH. OUR

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:40.954
THOSE RATES AND AGAIN THE

01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:42.523
STANDARD REMEMBER RECENT RATE

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:43.790
STRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE

01:42:43.857 --> 01:42:45.025
REGIONAL MARKET RATE IS WE

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:46.994
ACTUALLY CONDUCT A SURVEY. AFTER

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:48.495
THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE SURVEY

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:51.098
AT TO GET TO ADD IDENTIFIED FIVE

01:42:51.164 --> 01:42:53.667
REGION. I WATCHED THAT PROVIDERS

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:56.637
ARE CURRENTLY CHARGING. THEM SO

01:42:56.703 --> 01:42:59.006
AGAIN LOOKING AT UNIFIED RATE

01:42:59.072 --> 01:43:00.641
STRUCTURE. AND LOOKING AT THE

01:43:00.707 --> 01:43:02.676
PROCESS BY WHICH WE DEVELOP THE

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:10.784
RATE. STRUCTURE FOR THE ENTIRE

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:11.952
STATE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR ANSWER

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:14.721
A SO. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THE

01:43:14.788 --> 01:43:15.656
- RATE STRUCTURE MEAN THE REASON

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:17.524
WE HAVE A REGIONAL RATE

01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:18.792
STRUCTURE IS BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:20.093
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN COST OF

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.362
LIVING VRY VERY LARGE.

01:43:22.429 --> 01:43:24.998
DIFFERENCES TO HOW WITH. THE END

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:26.300
AND I'M NOT AGAIN I'M NOT

01:43:26.366 --> 01:43:27.834
ADVOCATING FOR KEEPING THE

01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:29.703
REGIONAL RATE STRUCTURE I THINK

01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:32.105
WE'VE ALL SEEN- IT'S CHALLENGES

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:34.908
OVER THE YEARS. BUT HOW WOULD

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:37.611
YOU THEN INCORPORATE THE COST OF

01:43:37.678 --> 01:43:39.846
LIVING DIFFERENCES INTO I GUESS

01:43:39.913 --> 01:43:41.848
WHAT WHAT I HEAR A REUNIFIED

01:43:41.915 --> 01:43:42.983
RATE STRUCTURE ARE YOU TALKING

01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:46.219
ABOUT. A SINGLE RATE STRUCTURE

01:43:46.286 --> 01:43:48.422
FOR THE- STATE WHICH I ASSUME IS

01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:49.823
KIND OF WHERE YOU'RE GOING MY

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:52.059
QUESTION WAS HOW HOW DO YOU

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:52.926
ACCOUNT FOR THE REGIONAL COSTS

01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:54.895
OF LIVING DIFFERENCES. SURE SURE

01:43:54.962 --> 01:43:56.229
SO WE COULD STILL WITHIN A

01:43:56.296 --> 01:43:58.432
UNIFIED STRUCTURE THINK ABOUT

01:43:58.498 --> 01:43:59.499
THE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES THAT

01:43:59.566 --> 01:44:01.401
CAN CERTAINLY BE PART OF HOW

01:44:01.468 --> 01:44:02.569
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT THAT'S KIND

01:44:02.636 --> 01:44:03.770
OF A CONVERSATION THAT'S

01:44:03.837 --> 01:44:04.738
HAPPENING IN THE WORK GROUPS

01:44:04.805 --> 01:44:06.506
NOW. SINGLE IS JUST SIMPLY TO

01:44:06.573 --> 01:44:08.475
SAY WHY DO WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

01:44:08.542 --> 01:44:10.043
RATE STRUCTURES IN THE ENTIRETY

01:44:10.110 --> 01:44:12.112
OF THE FIELD. CAN WE HAVE ONE IN

01:44:12.179 --> 01:44:14.047

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:15.215
ABSOLUTELY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

01:44:15.282 --> 01:44:16.350

CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ALLOWS FOR

01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:26.360
A SURVEY AGAIN THIS REGIONAL

01:44:26.426 --> 01:44:27.694
SERVICE THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING

01:44:27.761 --> 01:44:29.129
HISTORICALLY IN CALIFORNIA IT

01:44:29.196 --> 01:44:31.164
ALSO ALLOWS FOR ALTERNATIVE

01:44:31.231 --> 01:44:33.600
METHODOLOGIES TO IDENTIFY HABITS

01:44:33.667 --> 01:44:35.535
THAT THOSE RATE SO AGAIN. I THIS

01:44:35.602 --> 01:44:36.570
IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:38.839
HAVING TO DETERMINE ALL THINGS

01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:41.174
CONSIDERED TO YOUR POINT AROUND-

01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:42.643
IN IN WHAT IN THAT PANEL IS THAT

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:44.578
I'VE SPOKEN THIS MORNING I WHAT

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:46.413
ARE THE COMPONENTS THAT NEED TO

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.249
BE PART OF A UNIFIED STRUCTURE.

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:51.451
EVEN IF EVEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

01:44:51.518 --> 01:44:53.353
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. UNDERSTOOD

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:54.588
BUT I THINK I THINK MY CONCERN

01:44:54.655 --> 01:44:57.524
IS WE HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT IS.

01:44:57.591 --> 01:45:01.228
ALREADY UNDER- WE KNOW THAT

01:45:01.294 --> 01:45:02.562
THEIR ALSO INDUSTRY WHICH IS

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:04.765
VERY CRITICAL FOR THE STATE TO

01:45:04.831 --> 01:45:09.936

01:45:10.003 --> 01:45:11.705

BUDGET. BUT A TITO SOUNDED LIKE

01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:25.419
OR WOULD WE NEED SOME MORE TIME

01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:27.554
TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND I THINK-

01:45:27.621 --> 01:45:28.889
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S DOING

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:31.792
MORE RESEARCH TO DETERMINE THAT

01:45:31.858 --> 01:45:33.660

QUESTIONS ON THAT IT'S HELPFUL

02:00:47.607 --> 02:00:49.241
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE

02:00:49.308 --> 02:00:49.942
MILLION NUMBER IS AN INCREASE TO

02:00:50.009 --> 02:00:51.410
THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL

02:00:51.477 --> 02:00:52.445
PROGRAM. SO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

02:00:52.511 --> 02:00:54.947
SERVICES WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL

02:00:55.014 --> 02:00:57.817
FUNDS AS WELL. ON THE BUDGET

02:00:57.883 --> 02:00:59.552
PROPOSAL I THE BUDGET PROPOSALS

02:00:59.619 --> 02:01:01.020
AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:02.855
INVESTMENTS AND INCLUSION ARE

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.724
SUPPORTING MULTILINGUAL LEARNERS

02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:06.092
AND ENSURING STABILITY FOR

02:01:06.158 --> 02:01:07.426
CHILDREN ENROLLED IN STATE

02:01:07.493 --> 02:01:09.862
PRESCHOOL. ON INCLUSION THAT'S A

02:01:09.929 --> 02:01:12.031
REALLY KEY ISSUE FOR US SINCE AS

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:13.899
WE LOOK AT THE DATA WE REALLY

02:01:13.966 --> 02:01:15.935
LAG BEHIND OTHER STATE AND THE

02:01:16.002 --> 02:01:17.903
NATION IN TERMS OF PROVIDING

02:01:17.970 --> 02:01:19.538
SERVICES FOR PRESCHOOL AGE

02:01:19.605 --> 02:01:21.641
CHILDREN. IN WHAT'S CALLED THE

02:01:21.707 --> 02:01:23.175
LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT

02:01:23.242 --> 02:01:23.976
AND THAT'S WHERE CHILDREN ARE

02:01:24.043 --> 02:01:25.878
ENROLLED. WITH DISABILITIES ARE

02:01:25.945 --> 02:01:27.380
ENROLLED IN PROGRAMS IN

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:29.415
PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF IN

02:01:29.482 --> 02:01:32.618
A SPECIAL DAY CLASSROOMS- THAT'S

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:33.819
ONLY FOR CHILDREN WITH

02:01:33.886 --> 02:01:36.756
DISABILITIES. SO IN TWENTY

02:01:36.822 --> 02:01:38.290
TWENTY ONE THE CALIFORNIA SERVED

02:01:38.357 --> 02:01:40.660
UNDER 30% OF PRESCHOOLERS WITH

02:01:40.726 --> 02:01:42.928
INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PLANS

02:01:42.995 --> 02:01:46.298
OR IEPS. IN AN INCLUSIVE

02:01:46.365 --> 02:01:47.800
STARTING. SO AS WE LOOK AT THE

02:01:47.867 --> 02:01:50.036
RESEARCH IT REALLY SHOWS US THAT

02:01:50.102 --> 02:01:51.804
WHEN WE SERVE CHILDREN WITH IEPS

02:01:51.871 --> 02:01:53.873
IN INCLUSIVE SETTINGS THEY'LL

02:01:53.939 --> 02:01:55.808
HAVE FEWER OPPORTUNITIES THAT

02:01:55.875 --> 02:01:57.076
THE START WHEN THEY'RE NOT

02:01:57.143 --> 02:01:58.611
SERVED IN INCLUSIVE SETTINGS.

02:01:58.678 --> 02:02:00.846
THEY HAVE FEWER OPPORTUNITIES-

02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:02.882
TO ACCESS GENERAL EDUCATION THEY

02:02:02.948 --> 02:02:04.250
TEND TO REMAIN IN SPECIAL

02:02:04.316 --> 02:02:06.786
EDUCATION AND THAT WHEN WE

02:02:06.852 --> 02:02:07.920
INCREASED THAT PROPORTION OF

02:02:07.987 --> 02:02:10.222
THEIR TIME SPENT AND GENERAL

02:02:10.289 --> 02:02:12.191
EDUCATION. THAT IS A STRONG

02:02:12.258 --> 02:02:14.260
PREDICTOR OF ACADEMIC GROWTH

02:02:14.326 --> 02:02:15.961
IMPROVED OUTCOMES AND

02:02:16.028 --> 02:02:17.963
INTENTIONALLY THIS SUPPORTS ALL

02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:22.134
CHILDREN BOTH OF THOSE AND WITH

02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:23.035
AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES. BUDGET

02:02:23.102 --> 02:02:24.904
PROPOSAL STRATEGIES ARE REALLY

02:02:24.970 --> 02:02:26.939
KEY FOR ADDRESSING THAT FULL

02:02:27.006 --> 02:02:29.308
INCLUSION KEYS ARE IN PURPLE

02:02:29.375 --> 02:02:31.744
PROVIDING SUPPORTS TO PROGRAMS

02:02:31.811 --> 02:02:35.214
TO GET THEIR- SO WITH NEARLY

02:02:35.281 --> 02:02:36.015
THIRTY SIX THOUSAND PRESCHOOL

02:02:36.082 --> 02:02:37.850
AGE CHILDREN WITH IEPS IN

02:02:37.917 --> 02:02:39.752
CALIFORNIA NOT SERVED IN AN

02:02:39.819 --> 02:02:42.188
INCLUSIVE PROGRAM WE DO EXPECT

02:02:42.254 --> 02:02:43.923
THAT STATE PRESCHOOL CONTRACTORS

02:02:43.989 --> 02:02:45.891
WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THE 10%

02:02:45.958 --> 02:02:47.593
REQUIREMENT. ESPECIALLY IF

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:49.662
THEY'RE GIVEN TIME IN SUPPORT TO

02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:51.564
DO SO AS IS THE CASE IN THE

02:02:51.630 --> 02:02:53.532
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WE

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:55.167
REALLY THINK A KEY PART OF THIS

02:02:55.234 --> 02:02:57.903
IS THOSE INVESTMENTS THE FIVE

02:02:57.970 --> 02:02:59.405
HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE

02:02:59.472 --> 02:03:00.740
INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION

02:03:00.806 --> 02:03:02.708
EXPANSION PROGRAM OR KEEP. AS

02:03:02.775 --> 02:03:04.376
WELL AS THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS

02:03:04.443 --> 02:03:06.378
FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND

02:03:06.445 --> 02:03:08.547
INTERVENTION WHICH WILL SUPPORT

02:03:08.614 --> 02:03:11.083
I'M NEEDING THAT TEN PERCENT. ON

02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:12.585
THE EVE WE HAVE HEARD FROM

02:03:12.651 --> 02:03:14.253
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:16.388
THAT PROVIDE STATE PRESCHOOL BUT

02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:18.457
THEY WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM

02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:19.792
SUPPORT PROVIDED THROUGH THE

02:03:19.859 --> 02:03:21.660
PROGRAM SO WE DON'T MINOR

02:03:21.727 --> 02:03:23.929
COMMENTS HERE WITH THE L. A. IN

02:03:23.996 --> 02:03:25.831
FLAGGING THE NEED FOR FUNDS TO

02:03:25.898 --> 02:03:26.699
SUPPORT COMMUNITY BASED

02:03:26.766 --> 02:03:28.667
ORGANIZATIONS AND THIS COULD BE

02:03:28.734 --> 02:03:30.102
DONE EITHER BY INCREASING THE

02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:31.971
AMOUNT. OF FOR STATE LEVEL

02:03:32.037 --> 02:03:33.272
TRAINING AND TECHNICAL

02:03:33.339 --> 02:03:34.807
ASSISTANCE THAT WILL SUPPORT ALL

02:03:34.874 --> 02:03:36.942
PROGRAMS INCLUDING COMMUNITY

02:03:37.009 --> 02:03:38.844

AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU

02:03:47.219 --> 02:03:50.523
ON WHAT THE NEED. IS THERE AND

02:03:50.589 --> 02:03:51.290
WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT.

02:03:51.357 --> 02:03:52.758
UNDER OTHER STATE PRESCHOOL ON

02:03:52.825 --> 02:03:53.793
THE OTHER STATE PRESCHOOL

02:03:53.859 --> 02:03:54.627
PROPOSAL SO WE REALLY

02:03:54.693 --> 02:03:56.695
APPRECIATE- THE PROPOSAL TO

02:03:56.762 --> 02:03:58.364
INCREASE THE ADJUSTMENT FACTOR

02:03:58.430 --> 02:04:00.199
FOR DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AND

02:04:00.266 --> 02:04:01.867
THE PROPOSAL AROUND TWENTY FOUR

02:04:01.934 --> 02:04:03.202
MONTH ELIGIBILITY SINCE THAT

PRESCHOOL WE KNOW THAT WE DON'T

02:04:15.948 --> 02:04:17.883
THINK THAT MANY WILL BE SERVED I

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:19.718
SINCE THEIR LAST PRIORITY UNDER

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:22.822

DEVELOPMENTALLY DIFFERENT PLACES

02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:34.400

DIFFERENT SUPPORT IN THE

02:04:36.202 --> 02:04:37.236
CLASSROOM. THAT'S SOMETHING WE

02:04:37.303 --> 02:04:38.804
WOULD NEED TO ADDRESS AT CD AND

02:04:38.871 --> 02:04:40.506
R. REGULATIONS AS PART OF

02:04:40.573 --> 02:04:42.575

EXPERTS TO LOOK AT WHAT WOULD BE

02:04:50.816 --> 02:04:52.785
THE MOST APPROPRIATE HERE. BUT

02:04:52.852 --> 02:04:55.020
EVEN WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR CURRENT

INVESTMENTS ARE KEY TO THIS

02:23:30.468 --> 02:23:31.135
EFFORT.BECAUSE THE

02:24:27.258 --> 02:24:28.760
TO THE NEXT YEAR OF

02:24:28.826 --> 02:24:30.061
IMPLEMENTATION WE KNOW HOW

02:24:30.128 --> 02:24:31.496
CRITICAL WILL BE BASED ON THE

02:24:31.562 --> 02:24:33.664
RESEARCH TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL

02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:54.152
FROM RESEARCH THAT LOWER STAFF

02:24:54.218 --> 02:24:56.721
CHILD RATIOS TEND TO BE LESS

02:24:56.788 --> 02:24:58.189
STRESSFUL FOR TEACHERS WHICH CAN

02:24:58.256 --> 02:25:00.258
LEAD TO A MORE EMOTIONALLY

HEARD FROM SOME OTHER DISTRICTS

02:39:42.072 --> 02:39:43.707
ESPECIALLY SOME LARGER ONES THAT

02:39:43.774 --> 02:39:45.676
THEY MIGHT NEED MORE TIME. TO

02:39:45.742 --> 02:39:47.945

FACILITIES AND TRYING TO BUILD

02:39:51.615 --> 02:39:54.318
THAT WORK FORCE OUT I THINK

02:39:54.384 --> 02:39:54.885
WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL OF OUR

02:39:54.952 --> 02:39:56.853
ALLEY AS- SAME THING IS IN THE

CONTINUES TO NEED SUPPORT AND

02:40:03.026 --> 02:40:05.028
WHILE IT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT

02:40:05.095 --> 02:40:07.130
TO EVERYBODY ELSE WE THOUGHT

02:40:07.197 --> 02:40:07.764
FOUR HUNDRED LETTERS OF INTENT

02:40:07.831 --> 02:40:11.268
WAS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. AND-

02:40:11.335 --> 02:40:12.903
I'LL OF THOSE- COMING TOGETHER

02:40:12.970 --> 02:40:14.137
AS THE CONSORTIUMS THAT WE HAVE

02:40:14.204 --> 02:40:16.106
SOME FROM COUNTY OFFICES OF BAD

02:40:16.173 --> 02:40:17.808
WITH THEIR THAN PULLING TOGETHER

02:40:17.874 --> 02:40:18.642
AND SUPPORTING OTHER SCHOOL

02:40:18.709 --> 02:40:20.944
DISTRICTS. WE WILL NOTE THAT

02:40:21.011 --> 02:40:22.879
EDUCATOR PIPELINE HAS BEEN AN

02:40:22.946 --> 02:40:24.748
ISSUE FOR A WHILE NOW IN

02:40:24.815 --> 02:40:27.884
CALIFORNIA. AND THAT THE CODE

02:40:27.951 --> 02:40:28.385
NINETEEN DEFINITELY HAS

02:40:28.452 --> 02:40:30.220
EXACERBATED THE AMOUNT OF

02:40:30.287 --> 02:40:31.788
TEACHERS THAT HAVE LEFT THIS

02:40:31.855 --> 02:40:33.590
FIELD AND ONLY GROWN HOW MANY

02:40:33.657 --> 02:40:35.092
MORE TEACHERS AND OTHER STAFF

02:40:35.158 --> 02:40:37.027
ARE NEEDED TO COME IN. SO

02:40:37.094 --> 02:40:38.762
ENSURING THAT THERE ARE ON GOING

02:40:38.829 --> 02:40:40.998
SUPPORT. AND DIFFERENT PIPELINES

02:40:41.064 --> 02:40:42.532
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IS ALWAYS A

02:40:42.599 --> 02:40:44.167
CRITICAL PART OF THAT. SOME OF

02:40:44.234 --> 02:40:46.269
THAT MAY BE A CAPACITY ISSUE AS

02:40:46.336 --> 02:40:47.838
WELL SO GOING BACK TO

02:40:47.904 --> 02:40:50.407
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RACIST COMMENT WE

02:40:50.474 --> 02:40:52.042
DO THINK THAT IT IS HARD FOR

02:40:52.109 --> 02:40:54.111
SOME ELEAZAR AND OTHERS TO

02:40:54.177 --> 02:40:55.746
ACTUALLY APPLY FOR FRIENDS

02:40:55.812 --> 02:40:57.681
BECAUSE OF THE ALL THE COMPETING

02:40:57.748 --> 02:40:59.950
CAPACITY NEEDS. AND WOULD ALSO

02:41:00.017 --> 02:41:01.918
LOOK TO OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT

02:41:01.985 --> 02:41:04.154
THEM. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THOSE

02:41:04.221 --> 02:41:06.223
THAT ARE JOINING TOGETHER IS THE

02:41:06.289 --> 02:41:09.459
CONSORTIUM TO HELP ADDRESS SOME

02:41:09.526 --> 02:41:13.997
OF THOSE CAPACITY ISSUES. SO IT

02:41:14.064 --> 02:41:16.666
IS. IT IS THAT A YES OR NO THAT

02:41:16.733 --> 02:41:20.137
WE NEED TO. TO CHANGE THE LAW TO

02:41:20.203 --> 02:41:22.572

FOR IT NOW BUT YOU KNOW RENT IS

02:43:38.041 --> 02:43:39.209
SO HIGH COSTS ARE SO HIGH

02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:40.810
INFLATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE

02:43:40.877 --> 02:43:43.847
