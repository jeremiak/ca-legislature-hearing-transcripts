THE COMMITTEE -- THREE NINE I I

00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:50.922
DO HAVE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR --

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:52.156
A LOT OF THE RESEARCH IN

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:53.691
CALIFORNIA.

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.126
IS USUALLY DONE.

00:34:55.193 --> 00:34:58.796
AT AT THE UC LEVEL.

00:34:58.863 --> 00:35:01.265
QUESTION TO YOU TO THE AUTHOR

00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:01.966
WHY.

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:05.570
WHY DO YOU RECOMMEND IN THE BILL

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:08.339
DID THIS -- AND TO DE BE

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:10.408
ESTABLISHED IN THE CSU SYSTEM

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:11.776
QUESTION FOR TWO REASONS --

00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:13.144
RESEARCHERS IMPORTING IS

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:15.279
IMPORTANT BUT IMPLEMENTING IT IS

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:16.714
PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT.

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.516
AND THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT

00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:19.417
MOST OF THE CREDENTIALS THE

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:20.384
TEACHING CREDENTIALS IN THE

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:21.886
STATE OF CALIFORNIA COME OUT OF

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:23.521
THE CSU SYSTEM.

00:35:23.588 --> 00:35:24.422
I THE OTHER SHOW HORSE AND THE

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:25.223
WORK FORCE OF OUR EDUCATIONAL

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:27.325
SYSTEM AND AGAIN MOST OF THE

00:35:27.391 --> 00:35:28.426
TEACHER CANDIDATES COME COME OUT

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:30.228
OF OUT OF THE CSU SYSTEM IN FACT

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:31.762
JUST VERY FEW SCHOOLS.

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:34.265
OF THE CSU SYSTEM SO -- I I

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:36.868
THINK THIS ISSUE IS THE NATURAL

00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:38.402
PLACE IS A NATURAL FIT. FOR AN

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.438
ENTITY OF THIS TYPE BECAUSE WE

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:41.706
WANTED THOSE.

00:35:41.772 --> 00:35:42.874
ARE WE WANT TO TEACHER

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.042
CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO HAVE.

00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:47.245
TO GAIN FROM -- THE RESEARCH

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:48.946
DONE AT THE UC LEVEL AGAIN THIS

00:35:49.013 --> 00:35:50.448
ISN'T ABOUT RESEARCH IS ABOUT

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:52.350
COLLECTING THE RESEARCH AND

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:54.352
APPLYING IT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:55.720
AND IF YOU WOULD LEAVE IT TO THE

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:58.022
CSU TO DETERMINE WHERE TO PLACE

00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:59.257
IT NO BUT I WOULD HOPE THEY

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:00.958
WOULD THINK -- THE I HOPE THEY

00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:01.726
WOULD.

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.294
TARGET SUCH A CENTER AND AN AREA

00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:05.296
THAT I PRODUCES A LOT OF TEACHER

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:06.430
CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES.

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:10.635
AND HAS THE CHALLENGES -- IT

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:12.870
WITHIN ITS LOCAL COMMUNITY.

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:16.240
THAT -- IT HAD IT WIRED THE

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:17.141
ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS PRESENT LET

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:18.309
ME BE BLUNT SO THEY CAN EMPLOYER

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:19.644
OF THE VERY LOCAL LEVEL AND

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.278
MAYBE SEND SOME THEIR TEACHER

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:21.445
CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES.

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:23.247

00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:31.388
A SOURCE OF STRESS BOTH PERSONAL

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:24.234
COMMISSION SALES PEOPLE.

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:25.502
THEY WEREN'T PAID TO GIVE ME

SCHOOL TO TELL ME HOW MUCH IT

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:29.907

SCHOOL WOULD HELP ME REACH MY

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:32.876
GOALS.

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.345
THEY WERE ONLY PAID TO GET ME TO

00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:35.646
ENROLL.

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:37.681
AFTER GRADUATION CAREER SERVICES

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:39.216
REGULARLY CONTACTED ME WITH

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:40.317

OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNPAID JOBS TO

00:43:42.252 --> 00:43:43.954
BE FOUND ON THE LOCAL CRAIGSLIST

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:45.389
PAGE.

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.924
PERHAPS WORST OF ALL HIS MISSION

00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:48.392
COUNSELORS BLATANTLY LIED ABOUT

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:49.626
THE EMPLOYMENT RATES OF STUDENTS

AFTER GRADUATION AS WELL AS THE

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:53.764
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:56.667
STUDENTS WERE MAKING.

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:58.035
IN SHORT WELL I WORKED MULTIPLE

00:43:58.102 --> 00:43:59.903
JOBS TO STAY IN SCHOOL BROOKS

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.438
MCC WERE HAPPILY RAKING IN

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:03.140
PROFITS BY DEFRAUDING THOUSANDS

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:05.009
OF STUDENTS AND NO ONE WAS

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.310
STOPPING THEM.

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:07.911
NO ONE WAS ALERTING THE PUBLIC

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:09.380
OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS.

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:10.881
NO ONE WAS THERE TO HELP ANY OF

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:12.816
THIS RECOUP OUR FINANCIAL LOSSES

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:14.451
TO SAY NOTHING OF THE DISASTROUS

00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:17.254
EFFECT THIS LEVEL OF DEBT HAS ON

00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:18.555
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:20.491
IF THIS SEEMS OUTRAGEOUS TO YOU

00:44:20.557 --> 00:44:21.525
GOOD.

00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:23.060
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS AND IT'S NOT

00:44:23.127 --> 00:44:24.495
HYPERBOLE.

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:25.596
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF FORMER

00:44:25.662 --> 00:44:27.164
BURKE STUDENTS WHO'VE ALREADY

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:28.899
FILED FOR BORROWERS DEFENSE TO

00:44:28.966 --> 00:44:30.868
REPAYMENT AND THAT NUMBER IS

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:32.536
SURE TO GROW.

00:44:32.603 --> 00:44:33.270
WHILE THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:34.838
EDUCATION SITS ON THEIR HANDS

00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:36.540
DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT THE

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:37.975
FEDERAL LEVEL I HOPE THAT

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:39.209
LEGISLATORS IN THE STATE I'VE

00:44:39.276 --> 00:44:41.045

THE CENTURY FOUNDATION.

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:54.792
I SERVED IN THE OBAMA

00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:56.860
ADMINISTRATION AND WORKED ON

00:44:56.927 --> 00:44:58.762
SOME OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:01.198
THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:03.367
NOW -- UNDERMINING THERE ARE

00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:04.802
UNFORTUNATELY HUNDREDS OF

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:06.804
THOUSANDS OF FORMER STUDENTS WHO

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.339

RECESS HAVE SIMILAR STORIES --

00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:13.010
THIS IS A COMMON SENSE

00:45:13.077 --> 00:45:15.412
PROTECTION LEGISLATION IF THE

00:45:15.479 --> 00:45:18.115
BULK OF THE STUDENTS IN A MAJOR

00:45:18.182 --> 00:45:19.650
NOT A WHOLE SCHOOL BUT IN THAT

00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:21.885
PARTICULAR PROGRAMS YEAR AFTER

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:22.686
YEAR.

00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:25.389
I HAVING TO TAKE ON MORE DEBT

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:27.458
THAN IS REASONABLE FOR THEM TO

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:28.959
BE ABLE TO REPAIR A AS A

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:30.260
GRADUATE THAT OF THAT

00:45:30.327 --> 00:45:31.562
INSTITUTION THE INSTITUTION

00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:33.197
EITHER NEXT TAKE NEEDS TO TAKE

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:35.632
ACTION TO ADDRESS THAT. FOR STOP

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:38.368
IN ROLLING CALIFORNIANS THAT SUB

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:40.604
BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTION

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:43.474
AGAINST EXCESSIVE DEBT GIVEN

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.108
EARNINGS.

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:44.708
I'M GONNA ADDRESS IF I LOOK

00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:46.510
THROUGH THE THE LETTERS FROM

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:48.412
SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND AND

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:49.813
OPPOSITION A MEDIC QUICKLY

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.683
ADDRESS THE KEY ITEMS THAT I SAW

00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:55.119
IN THOSE LETTERS ONE IS.

00:45:55.185 --> 00:45:56.053
THE DATA WHERE DO WE GET THE

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.988
DATA THERE IS STRONG BIPARTISAN

00:45:58.055 --> 00:45:59.556
SUPPORT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:00.858
HAVING DEBT AND EARNINGS DATA

00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:02.159
AND IN FACT THE TRUMP

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:03.827
ADMINISTRATION WHILE THEY ARE.

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:07.030
REPEALING THE REGULATIONS --

00:46:07.097 --> 00:46:08.932
HAVE INDICATED SUPPORT FOR

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:10.868
CONTINUING TO PROVIDE DEBT AND

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:12.803
EARNINGS DATA SO THE THE BEST

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.571
SOLUTION WILL BE THAT THE

00:46:14.638 --> 00:46:16.406
COLLEGES WORK WITH US TO MAKE

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:17.841
SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE DATA

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:19.376
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:22.479
THE BILL PROVIDES FOR A MATCHING

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:24.748
DATA WITH THE STATE EMPLOYMENT

00:46:24.815 --> 00:46:26.383
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT --

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.118
CONTRARY TO WHAT IS STATED IN

00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:29.653
ONE OR TWO OF THE LETTERS THIS

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.522
IS NOT SAMPLE DATA THIS IS

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:34.458
ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL -- IT DATA

00:46:34.525 --> 00:46:37.027
FROM THE STATE YOU WHY SYSTEM --

00:46:37.094 --> 00:46:38.896
AND WOULD PROVIDE A GOOD

00:46:38.962 --> 00:46:41.598
REPLACEMENT IF THE FEDERAL DATA

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:47.204
ARE ARE NOT AVAILABLE.

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:48.705
A SECOND -- CRITICISM -- IN THE

00:46:48.772 --> 00:46:49.439
LETTERS WAS THAT LOANS THAT

00:46:49.506 --> 00:46:50.040
STUDENTS TAKE OUT FOR LIVING

00:46:50.107 --> 00:46:51.275
EXPENSES SHOULD NOT COUNT

00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:52.676
AGAINST THE SCHOOL.

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:54.278
IN THE GAME FOR EMPLOYMENT ROLE

00:46:54.344 --> 00:46:55.646
THEY DON'T COUNT AGAINST THE

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:57.347
SCHOOL AT ALL THE AMOUNT THAT

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:59.816
COUNTS IS THE IS THE TUITION AND

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.185
FEES THAT IS CHARGED BY THE

00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:02.119
INSTITUTION NOT THE LIVING

00:47:02.186 --> 00:47:03.287
EXPENSES SO THIS IS A

00:47:03.353 --> 00:47:04.688
MISUNDERSTANDING.

00:47:04.755 --> 00:47:06.123
ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE GAME FOR

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.292
EMPLOY -- THE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT

00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:09.693
RULE WORKS.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.063
THIRD -- THERE -- IF THERE'S

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.264
BEEN A LOT OF COSMETOLOGY

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:15.632
SCHOOLS COLLEGE COSMETOLOGY

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:17.234
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:19.736
CONCERNS BUT IN FACT -- THE

00:47:19.803 --> 00:47:21.972
PROPORTION OF ABOUT LESS THAN

00:47:22.039 --> 00:47:23.407
ONE OUT OF TEN COSMETOLOGY

00:47:23.473 --> 00:47:26.610
PROGRAMS -- FAILED THE LAST --

00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:27.945
THE DATA THEY CAME OUT FROM THE

00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:29.446
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- IN FROM

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:30.914
GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:32.950
ABOUT THE SAME RATE AS OTHER

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:34.918
KINDS OF CAREER PROGRAM SO THERE

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:37.854
DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY MAJOR

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:39.923
PROBLEM IN COSMETOLOGY AND TO

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.825
THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE WAGES

00:47:41.892 --> 00:47:43.427
THAT ARE NOT REPORTED.

00:47:43.493 --> 00:47:45.462
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CAUSING --

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:48.165
THEM -- TO FAIL THE MEASURES IT

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:50.300
AT LARGE RATES AT THE SAME TIME

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.269
TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DO THERE

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:54.538
ARE APPEALS PROCEDURES FOR THEM

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:55.939
TO EIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE --

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:58.008
ALTERNATIVES -- ALTERNATIVE

00:47:58.075 --> 00:47:59.843
EARNINGS INFORMATION -- AND

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.612
LASTLY I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:04.648
CONCERNS THAT THE THE BUREAU ARE.

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:07.050
STATE REGULATOR -- CAN'T HANDLE

00:48:07.117 --> 00:48:08.785
SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- I THINK

00:48:08.852 --> 00:48:10.020
IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:11.722
THE BUREAU SORT OF LIKE THE DMV

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:13.090
THERE'S OUT THERE A LICENSING

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:14.858
AGENCIES THEY THEY THEY HAND OUT

00:48:14.925 --> 00:48:15.726
LICENSES.

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:18.028
AND THEN FOLKS GO AND DO THINGS

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:20.030
WITH THAT WAS DO THINGS AND

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:22.232
DRIVING THEIR CARS OR WHATEVER

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:23.333
SO WE HAVE IN THE IN THE DEEP IN

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.135
THE BUREAU SITUATION PEOPLE THAN

00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:26.103
FILE COMPLAINTS AND THEY'RE

00:48:26.169 --> 00:48:26.570
SAYING.

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:28.438
HEY THIS DRIVER OF THE SCHOOL

00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:29.806
WAS DRIVING A RADICALLY IN

00:48:29.873 --> 00:48:30.941
HURTING PEOPLE.

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:32.542
BUT THEY GET THOSE COMPLAINTS

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:35.178
AND WHAT DO THEY DO IT'S IT IS

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:37.314
IT IS NOT AN EASY JOB IN THE

00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:40.751
CONTRARY SITUATION HERE IS THAT

00:48:40.817 --> 00:48:41.718
THE GAME FULL EMPLOYMENT ROLE IS

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:46.323
LIKE AT LEAST LIKE HAVING A

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:48.358
SENSOR IN THE CAR OUR THAT BEEPS.

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:50.127
WHEN YOU HAVE DEBT LEVELS THAT

00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:50.861
ARE JUST TOO HIGH GIVEN THE

00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:52.496
EARNINGS SO IT SENDS A SIGNAL TO

00:48:52.562 --> 00:48:53.930
THE DRIVER AND IT IS INFORMATION

00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:56.166
THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE AGENCY

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:57.634
FOR ENFORCEMENT SO FROM AN

00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:59.236
ENFORCEMENT STANDPOINT?

00:48:59.303 --> 00:49:01.338
IT IS A LOT EASIER FOR THE

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:03.140
BUREAU TO IN FOR SOMETHING LIKE

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:05.442
THIS THEN THE TASK THAT THE

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:08.645
BUREAU HAS HAD AN ADMITTEDLY HAS

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:10.681
FUMBLED IN A LOT OF WAYS BUT

00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:12.449
THIS IS A MUCH EASIER TASK

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:13.583
BECAUSE IT INVOLVES.

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.752
CLEAR MEASURES THAT GET REPORTED

00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:17.087

HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THOSE.

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:29.346

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:36.686
PHOENIX IS NOT CONVINCED THAT IS

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:38.455
THE ONLY WAY TO JUDGE

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.357
INSTITUTIONS WE'VE MADE A NUMBER

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:41.658

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:42.592
YEARS.

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:44.828
SUCH AS DISQUALIFYING STUDENTS

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:46.096
THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS THE

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:48.265
BUYBACK BAGHDAD'S USING HIGH IN

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:49.499
CASH MANAGEMENT.

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:50.800
IN BOTH THOSE CASES THEY WERE

00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:52.569
IGNORED HAD THEY BEEN ADOPTED IN

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:53.803
BOTH THOSE CASES ACTUALLY

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.472
STUDENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:57.607
PROTECTED -- I'VE WORKED WITH

00:52:57.674 --> 00:53:00.176
THE BPP ITS SUCCESSOR AND ITS

00:53:00.243 --> 00:53:03.146

NEW LEADERSHIP.

00:53:06.316 --> 00:53:08.184
THERE IS NO PRACTICAL WAY THEY

00:53:08.251 --> 00:53:09.452
WILL BE ABLE TO DO WHAT IS

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:11.388
STATED IN THE BILL THIS IS WHAT

00:53:11.454 --> 00:53:13.223
THE ANALYSIS FOR SIXTEEN ELEVEN

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:14.224

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:15.759
WE BELIEVE IT'S STILL TO BE THE

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.327
CASE MY INSTITUTION IS GETTING

00:53:17.394 --> 00:53:18.728
COMPLAINTS FROM STUDENTS THAT

00:53:18.795 --> 00:53:21.031
ARE A YEAR OLD. TO THE EXTENT

00:53:21.097 --> 00:53:22.432
YOU IMPOSE THESE NEW OBLIGATIONS

00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:24.034
ON THE BUREAU IT'S SIMPLY GOING

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:25.402
TO BE WORSE AND IT'S NOT A FEE

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:27.337
FUNCTION ARE FEES ROSE TWO YEARS

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:28.104

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:30.473
FROM FIFTY THOUSAND TO FIVE

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:31.708
HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YEAR WE ARE

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:33.777
PAYING OUR FAIR SHARE IT IS

00:53:33.843 --> 00:53:36.880
SIMPLY LACKING A CLEAR MISSION.

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:38.748
WHICH THE HISTORICAL ISSUE IN MY

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:40.183
OPINION WITH THE BUREAU.

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:41.451
SO RATHER THAN TRYING TO

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:43.053
RECREATE THE FEDERAL SYSTEM

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:44.287
LET'S LOOK AWAY AS THE STATE CAN

00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:47.157
DO THIS AND A SIMPLER FASHION TO

00:53:47.223 --> 00:53:49.392
ADDRESS BAD ACTORS WHICH WE HAVE

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:50.927
A SHARED INTEREST ELIMINATE.

00:53:50.994 --> 00:53:53.563
THESE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.830
THANK YOU.

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:56.232
THANK YOU.

00:53:56.299 --> 00:53:57.601
MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE

00:53:57.667 --> 00:53:59.135
MEMBERS MY NAME IS RICK WOULD

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:01.771
AND THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE

00:54:01.838 --> 00:54:03.173
INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:04.574
WE HAVE OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:06.509
FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THREE

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:08.478
YEARS -- WE EMPLOY TWO HUNDRED

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:09.879
AND SIXTY PEOPLE.

00:54:09.946 --> 00:54:11.948
AND RETRAIN APPROXIMATELY TWO

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:12.849
THOUSAND STUDENTS -- EACH

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:15.352
CALENDAR YEAR I'M HERE TO OPPOSE

00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:16.553
A. B..

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.120
THIRTEEN FORTY ON BEHALF OF

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:18.888
THOSE EMPLOYEES STUDENTS AND

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:21.324
MEMBERS SCHOOLS OF OUR STATE

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:22.926
ASSOCIATION CAPS.

00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:24.728
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE MERITS

00:54:24.794 --> 00:54:25.996
OF THE REGULATION.

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:27.364
IN PARTICULAR TODAY DURING THE

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:30.900
TIME THAT WE HAVE HAVE EXCUSE ME.

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.068
THIS BILL IS INHERENTLY FLAWED

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:33.503
BECAUSE THE FEDERAL MODEL IT'S

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:36.339
BASED ON WAS FLAWED IN ITS AND

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:37.173
SEVENTY THE FEDERAL MODEL IS

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.541
FLAWED BECAUSE IT DENIES THE

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:39.476
STUDENT THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE A

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:40.710
COURSE OF STUDY.

00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:41.878
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEET AN

00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:44.014
ARBITRARY METRIC IMPOSED ON THAT

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.148
PROGRAM.

00:54:45.215 --> 00:54:47.050
THE FEDERAL MODEL IS ALSO FLAWED

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:48.885
BECAUSE IT ASSUMED WRONGLY THAT

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:50.487
WAGE DATA WAS STATIC.

00:54:50.553 --> 00:54:54.424
ACROSS STATES COUNTIES AND IN

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:55.458
CITIES AND IT IS NOT. FOR

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:57.060
EXAMPLE SOMEONE LIVING IN FRESNO

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:58.795
COUNTY WHERE I LIVE IS GOING TO

00:54:58.862 --> 00:55:00.130
MAKE MUCH LESS MONEY AS A

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:02.465
MEDICAL ASSISTANT AND THEY WILL

00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:03.466
MAKE IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:55:03.533 --> 00:55:04.601
AND YET THE SAME METRIC IS

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:06.469
APPLIED EQUALLY IN EACH OF THOSE

00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:07.837
REGIONS.

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.406
BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA MODEL IS

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:11.441
BASED ON THIS FEDERAL MODEL IT

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:13.176
TOO WOULD BE FLAWED ANDERSON

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:13.777
SEVENTY BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT

00:55:13.843 --> 00:55:16.413
RECOGNIZE REGIONAL WAGE

00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:17.814
DIFFERENCES.

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:18.448
LIKE THE FEDERAL MODEL THE STATE

00:55:18.515 --> 00:55:20.617
MODEL ALSO DOES NOT ADDRESS

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:21.851
UNDER REPORTED WAGES FOR

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:24.254
VOCATIONS LIKE COSMETOLOGY.

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.622
THOSE IN FAVOR THE BILL

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:27.057
MENTIONED THAT NOT TOO MANY

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:29.659
SCHOOLS WERE SUBJECT -- TO

00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:30.627
PENALTIES BECAUSE A GAINFUL

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:31.928
EMPLOYMENT THAT OFFERED

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:33.430
COSMETOLOGY HOWEVER THE COURTS

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:34.831
FELT DIFFERENTLY AND MADE

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:36.766
CHANGES TO THE RULE TO EXEMPT

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:38.568
THEM FROM.

00:55:38.635 --> 00:55:39.903
LIKE FEDERAL MODEL THERE IS NO

00:55:39.969 --> 00:55:41.538
DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE

00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:43.106
WAGES THAT ARE EARNED BY THEY

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:45.508
GRADUATED STUDENT AND REPORTED

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:47.177
AND THE PROGRAM OF STUDY.

00:55:47.243 --> 00:55:48.912
TAKEN AND IN NO WAY AND THERE IS

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:50.447
NO WAY TO CONNECT THOSE TWO

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:51.614
THINGS.

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:53.016
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'VE

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:54.484
OBSERVED AMONGST OUR STUDENTS IS

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:56.186
THAT OFTEN THEY WORK IN A JOB

00:55:56.252 --> 00:55:57.053
THAT WAS RELATED TO THEIR

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.254
TRAINING AT ALL.

00:55:58.321 --> 00:55:59.322
AND THOSE ARE THE WAGES THAT

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:01.357
WERE USED TO MAKE THE ASSESSMENT

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:02.592
OF THE PROGRAM OF STUDY.

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:04.194
AND THERE IS CURRENTLY NO REAL

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.329
WAY TO CONNECT THE TYPE OF WAYS

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:08.331
THEY AREN'T AS TO WHETHER IT'S

00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:09.933
RELATED TO THE TRAINING OR NOT.

00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:12.736
AND THE ACTUAL TRAINING THAT

00:56:12.802 --> 00:56:15.238
TOOK PLACE.

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:16.840
AS WELL IDENTIFIED.

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:19.008

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:18.888
20% OF OUR FAMILY OUR STUDENTS.

01:09:18.954 --> 01:09:22.258

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:23.559
FUTURES FOR THE STUDENTS.

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:25.060

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:26.762
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF DEBT.

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:28.731

TARGET HERE -- AND SO.

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.237
REALLY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:36.405
THE FEDERAL STANDARD THAT HAS

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:38.607
BEEN IN PLACE BEFORE PRESIDENT

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.576

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:42.077
AND HIS EDUCATION SECRETARY

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:44.280
DECIDED TO DISBAND THIS ROLE.

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:45.748
WE JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO WHAT

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.383
THE FEDERAL STANDARD WAS WHICH

01:09:47.449 --> 01:09:49.251
SHOWED THAT UNDER THAT RULE

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:50.619

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:02.965
I THINK NOT HAVING THIS ROLE

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.800
WILL MEAN THAT THOSE 20% OF

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.969

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:44.466
COLLECTING.

01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:46.101
I AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.269
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ROLLING

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:49.438
BACK THE RULE AT THIS TIME THEY

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:50.939
HAVE ACTUALLY PRESIDENT TRUMP

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:52.341
PUT OUT AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:54.309
REQUIRING HIS US DEPARTMENT OF

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.345
EDUCATION TO ALLOW FOR PROGRAM

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:57.946
LEVEL DATA AROUND STUDENT

01:11:58.013 --> 01:11:58.914
EARNINGS AND STUDENT DEBT TO

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.716
CONTINUES OUR HOPE IS THE

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:01.917
FEDERAL DATE IS GOING TO

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:02.551
CONTINUE AND CONTINUE TO BE THE

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:03.318
STANDARD.

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:06.121
BUT THIS BILL ALSO HAS AS A BACK

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:07.890
UP -- AND ABILITY FOR US TO

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:09.091
CONTINUE TO COLLECT THIS DATA

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.893
THROUGH STATE AGENCIES SO THAT

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:11.727
WE CAN.

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:14.697
CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THE ROLE

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:15.531
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:16.198
BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT ABOUT FUTURE

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:17.199
EARNINGS ARE ANY PROJECTION OF

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:18.634
WHAT SOMEONE MIGHT MAKE IT'S

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:19.601
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:21.637
EARNING WHAT THE ACTUAL INCOME

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:22.204
AS THOSE.

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:24.373
CERTAIN OCCUPATION OR PROGRAMS

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:28.010
SO IF THE CURRENT LAW SALARY IS --

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:30.379
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO ON

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:31.680
GOING CURRENT LAW.

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:37.152
IN BEGINNING SALARY THAN -- WHAT --

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:38.921
TUITION AMOUNT TO WOULD BE

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:40.522
ALLOWED THESE THAT THE TUITION

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:42.291
CONTROLLER OR NOT TO ALLOW THE

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:43.492
PROGRAM ITSELF SO THERE'S AS

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:45.227
VERY SPECIFIC STANDARD THAT'S

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:47.596
THAT ESSENTIALLY SAYS YOU FAIL

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:48.964
OR YOU'RE PASSING THE TEST IF.

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:50.866
YOU'RE ANNUAL LOAN REPAYMENT FOR

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:53.102
A GRADUATE IS BELOW 20% OF YOUR

01:12:53.168 --> 01:12:55.437
DISCRETIONARY INCOME OR 8% OF

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:57.406
YOUR TOTAL EARNINGS SO THAT'S

01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:57.740
THE STANDARD.

01:12:57.806 --> 01:12:59.007
THAT WAS ESTABLISHED.

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:01.009
IN LAW AND WHAT I WILL SAY IS

01:13:01.076 --> 01:13:02.177
WHEN IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN LAWS

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:03.879
SOME YEARS BACK THERE ARE MANY

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:04.546
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHO

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:05.914
THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.282
TOO LOW A STANDARD THAT THAT --

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:09.318
IT SHOULD BE REYES BUT THAT WAS

01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:10.652
A STANDARD THAT WAS AGREED UPON

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.454
AND EVEN UNDER THAT LOW STANDARD

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:13.555
WE STILL HAVE.

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:14.556
AGAIN -- 250- PROGRAMS IN THE

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.291
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:18.360
RECENTLY FAILED THAT TEST THIS

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:20.062
INTENDED CONTROL THOUGH TWEE

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:21.296
SHOWN AMOUNT THAT BEING CHARGED.

01:13:21.363 --> 01:13:22.464
NO THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:23.932
BILL TO CONTROLS A TUITION OUT

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:26.135
AGAIN THE POINT OF THIS IS IF

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:27.169
YOU ARE A STUDENT.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.238
AND YOU'LL TOLD YOU GO TO THIS

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:30.439
PARTICULAR KERR TRAINING PROGRAM.

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:32.808
YOUR SALARY WHEN YOU GRADUATE IS

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.042
GOING TO BE MUCH HIGHER THAN

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:35.277
WHATEVER YOU'RE MAKING NOW.

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:37.146
AND SO YOU IN KERR TENS OF

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:38.647
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF DEBT.

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:39.915
AND WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:42.451
SAID UNTIL THIS RULE WAS WAS WAS

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:48.023
WAS IN THE PROCESS BEEN ROLLED

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:48.924
BACK IS.

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:49.525
THOSE STUDENTS HAVE NOT SEEN

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.126
THEIR INCOMES RISE IN FACT MANY

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:52.060
OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE BARELY

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.262
EARNING THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE.

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:55.030
AND SO IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IF

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.431
YOU'VE IN COURT AN AWFUL LOT OF

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:57.099
DEBT.

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.333
AND YOU'RE NOT SENIOR INCOME

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.268
RISE.

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:01.303
THAT DEGREE PROGRAM IS NOT

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:02.805
HELPING YOU AND WE'RE TRYING TO

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:05.641
IDENTIFY AGAIN THOSE PROGRAMS.

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:07.342
WHICH IN CALIFORNIA RECENT WAS

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:08.677
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PROGRAMS ABOUT

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:10.679
25% OF THE OF 20% OF THE

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:13.448
PROGRAMS -- IN THE FOR PROFIT.

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:14.917
WORLD THOSE ARE PROGRAMS THAT

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.051
ARE FAILING OUR STUDENTS AND

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:18.987
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO IDENTIFY.

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.355
WHY ARE YOU LIMITING WANTED TO

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:21.824
PRIVATE SCHOOLS?

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.759
THERE IS ALREADY DATA THAT GETS

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.460
COLLECTED FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.663
AND WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO MATCH

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:29.198
THAT FOR THE PROPER FOR PROFIT

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:30.899
SECTOR SO  HAVE NO PROBLEM

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:32.367
APPLYING THIS TO ALL SCHOOLS.

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:34.069
IN FACT -- IF OTHERS WANT TO

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.437
COMMENT ON THIS I THINK THIS IS

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:36.972
A STANDARD THAT SHOULD APPLY TO

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:39.174
ALL SCHOOLS BUT WE ALSO WANTED

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:39.775
TO APPLY TO A SECTOR THAT HAS

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:41.043
NOT SEEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:43.078
CURRENTLY -- FOLLOW YOUR

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:46.915
REGULATIONS THAT SO -- SO YES --

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:49.184
THE UC SYSTEM THE COMMUNITY

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:53.088
COLLEGES -- CSU SYSTEM THEY ARE

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.289
AT THAT EDT ACTUALLY COORDINATES

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:56.558
WITH THOSE EDUCATION SECTORS TO

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:58.694
GET SIMILAR DATA.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.363
SO THAT THIS ONE HAS ALSO BRINGS

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:04.466
UP A LOT OF POTENTIAL. FOR

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:06.702
PROFIT LOSS OF LOS WITH SO FOR

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:09.872
THOSE OF GRADUATE SO WHEN THEY

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.740
THIS IN ALL DON'T FIND A JOB

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:14.343
WITHOUT WANTED OUT.

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:15.711
BE ABLE TO LAW.

01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:17.613
PAY THEIR DEBTS I WOULD SAY AS A

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:19.348
LAWYER IF THERE ARE CERTAIN LAW

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:20.649
SCHOOLS THAT ARE CAUSING

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:23.118
STUDENTS JUNK FOR SIX FIGURES OF

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:23.986
DEBTS.

01:15:24.052 --> 01:15:25.754
AND THOSE LAWYERS ARE UNABLE TO

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:27.589
BE EMPLOYED AND THERE'S A VERY

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:28.790
REGULAR AND CONSISTENT RECORD OF

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:31.260
THAT I THINK WE DO HAVE TO WORRY

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:31.860
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:35.764
STUDENTS.

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:36.365
I HAVE SOME -- JUST FACE IT

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:37.766
DOUBLE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS DO

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:39.368
TRACK THESE THESE KIND OF DATA

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:40.969
MATCHING THEIR GRADUATES

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:43.906
INFORMATION WITH THE STATE ET DE

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:45.540
BECAUSE THEY ARE PUBLICLY.

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:46.842
GOVERNED AND DON'T HAVE THE SAME

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:48.644
INCENTIVES AS FOR PROFITS WE

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:49.878
TEND TO NOT HAVE THE SAME KINDS

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:51.580
OF PROBLEMS THERE -- AND SO

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:52.748
THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:54.549
DIFFERENT REGULATIONS THAT APPLY

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:57.986
ON THE PRIVATE FOR PROFIT SIDE

01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.554
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE SEE THE

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:01.790
PROBLEMS THAT ARE AS A RESULT OF

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:03.492
THEIR CONTROL BEING IN THE HANDS

01:16:03.558 --> 01:16:04.660
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.762
WHO ARE ABLE TO POCKET ANY MONEY

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:07.996
THAT'S NOT SPENT ON THE

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:11.833
EDUCATION SO -- THIS APPROACH

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.669
HELPS TO ENCOURAGE THE SCHOOLS

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.237
TO SPEND ON THE EDUCATION SO

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:16.672
THAT STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:18.407
EARNING POWER COMING OUT TO

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:19.841
ACTUALLY REPAY.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.810
THE LOAN -- OR ADJUST THEIR

01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:23.578
PRICING IF IN FACT THAT'S WHAT'S

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:27.516
DRIVING THE HIGH AMOUNTS OF DEBT

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:29.685
IF IT'S NOT A REASONABLE AMOUNT.

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.219
BUT IT'S UP TO THE TEN IT'S UP

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:31.853
TO THE SCHOOLS HOW THEY WANT TO

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.287
RESPOND.

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:33.522
WOULD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:34.723
AGAIN A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:35.857
COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION --

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:36.758
LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:38.560
CONVERSATIONS BUT THIS IS REALLY

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:39.394
ABOUT MAKING SURE WE'RE PUTTING

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:41.196
OUR STUDENTS FIRST AND NOT THE

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.564
SHAREHOLDERS OF CERTAIN FOR

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:44.599
PROFIT INSTITUTIONS AND WITHOUT

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:45.534

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.201

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.403
I I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:49.871

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:53.008

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:00.515
IMPORTANT WAY TO MEASURE THE

TRYING TO GAME THE SYSTEM.

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:25.680

THIS EMERGING PROBLEM IS ALREADY

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:40.895
AFFECTING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS

01:26:40.962 --> 01:26:42.864
FOR EXAMPLE GRAND CANYON

NONPROFIT COLLEGE.

01:26:52.974 --> 01:26:54.275
HOWEVER THE PRESIDENT OF THE

NONPROFIT GRAND CANYON

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.745

01:26:57.812 --> 01:26:59.847
OF THE FOR PROFIT GRAND CANYON

01:26:59.914 --> 01:27:01.316
EDUCATION INCORPORATED.

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:02.784

REVENUE THAT THE NONPROFIT

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:06.020
COLLEGE RECEIVED FLOWS THROUGH

01:27:06.087 --> 01:27:08.823

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:13.828
GALLEY SAID THE NONPROFIT IS

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.196
ESSENTIALLY A TRUSTWORTHY

01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:17.332
LOOKING WRAPPER AROUND A FOR

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:18.733
PROFIT BUSINESS.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.435
THE ARRANGEMENT MAKES A MOCKERY

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:21.603
OF THE CONCEPT OF A NONPROFIT

01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:22.870
ORGANIZATION.

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:25.039
WITHOUT ENFORCEMENT OR OVERSIGHT

01:27:25.106 --> 01:27:26.874
THESE COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:27.942
WILL CONTINUE TO MISLEAD

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:29.310
STUDENTS AND AVOID APPROPRIATE

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:31.212
STATE OVERSIGHT.

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:33.815
IN FACT ASHFORD UNIVERSITY OWNED

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:34.949
BY BRIDGE POINT EDUCATION

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:37.118
INCORPORATED HAS ALREADY STATED

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:38.152
THAT IT WOULD FOLLOW GRAND

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:40.455
CANYON UNIVERSITY'S LEAD AND

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:42.090
CLAIM NONPROFIT STATUS.

01:27:42.156 --> 01:27:44.058
UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA CANNOT

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.326
RELY ON THE US DEPARTMENT OF

01:27:45.393 --> 01:27:47.929
EDUCATION TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:49.330
DESPITE THE POOR RECORD OF SOME

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:50.798
FEDERALLY FUNDED FOR PROFIT

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:52.500
COLLEGES AND SCANDALS THAT HAVE

01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:53.935
PLAGUED THE FOR PROFIT INDUSTRY.

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:55.603
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REFUSES

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:57.372
TO ADMIT THAT INVESTOR CONTROL

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.507
OF COLLEGES IS DETRIMENTAL TO

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:00.942
STUDENTS AND TAXPAYERS.

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:02.610
THEREFORE CALIFORNIA MUST STEP

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:04.178
UP AND STEP IN TO PROTECT OUR

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:05.713

01:28:21.195 --> 01:28:23.364
TO CONVERT TO NON PROFIT AND

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:25.133
HAVE FOUND THAT IN MANY

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:26.634
CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT THEY'VE

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:28.403
REALLY DONE IS SET UP A SHELL

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:30.571
CORPORATION AND PRETENDED TO BE

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:33.041
NONPROFIT BECAUSE THE IRS IS NO

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:34.409
LONGER REALLY ENFORCING

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:37.211
OVERSIGHT OF GENUINE NONPROFIT

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:37.445
STATUS.

01:28:37.512 --> 01:28:39.247
THE NONPROFIT NO WHEN YOU LOOK

01:28:39.313 --> 01:28:40.848

ARE FROM FOR PROFIT COLLEGES

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:57.265
THAT'S BECAUSE THE PUBLIC AND

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:59.634
NONPROFIT CONTROL OF COLLEGES

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:01.269
MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF

01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:03.438
CONSUMER PROTECTION IT HAS BEEN

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:05.440
VERY EFFECTIVE AND IT IS WHY

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:07.175

JOHN CANNOT TRANSFER HIS CREDITS

CANNOT EVEN APPLY FOR THE RACE

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:51.392
THAT WOULD HELP HIM GET RID OF

THIS TUITION DEBT.

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:54.228

IN MY RESEARCH IN IN MY PRACTICE

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:00.934
I FOUND TRANSIT WITHHOLDING TO

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:02.736
BE A COMMON PRACTICE THROUGHOUT

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:04.004
CALIFORNIA THE ECONOMIC

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:05.739
POTENTIAL OF TENS OF THOUSANDS

OF TRANSCRIPT WITHHOLDING.

01:39:09.376 --> 01:39:11.045

01:39:14.848 --> 01:39:16.517
FINANCIAL HOLDS.

01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:18.185
AB THIRTEEN THIRTEEN WILL UNLOCK

01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:19.853

01:42:57.137 --> 01:42:57.638
THIRTEEN FORTY THREE WHICH I

01:42:57.704 --> 01:42:58.572
BELIEVE IS A SIMPLE BILL TO

01:42:58.639 --> 01:43:00.307
PROTECT VETERANS AND TAXPAYER

01:43:00.374 --> 01:43:02.209

WORKING ON IT AND I KNOW WE

01:43:06.313 --> 01:43:09.116
CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME WORK TO DO

01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:11.285
FORWARD -- AND AS WE TALK ABOUT

01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:12.619
THIS BILL WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:14.755
THAT THESE ARE FOR PROFIT

01:43:14.821 --> 01:43:15.589
BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:16.890
ABOUT.

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:19.593
AND WANT TO DO VERY WELL --

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:20.561
FINANCIALLY ESPECIALLY.

01:43:20.627 --> 01:43:21.495
WE HAVE SEEN ONE ACCESS TO

01:43:21.562 --> 01:43:23.730
STUDENT AID INCREASES AND

01:43:23.797 --> 01:43:26.466
REGULATIONS DECREES -- THAT'S

01:43:26.533 --> 01:43:28.268
WHEN POLICY MAKERS NEED TO STEP

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:29.603
IN AND DO SOMETHING -- THERE IS

01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:31.071
A REASON THAT SHARES OF FOR

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:33.840
PROFIT COLLEGES JUMPED 40% AFTER

01:43:33.907 --> 01:43:35.075
THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

01:43:35.142 --> 01:43:37.811
ELECTION BECAUSE INVESTORS KNEW

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:39.212
THAT THERE WAS MONEY TO BE MADE.

01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:40.514
AND WE CAN BE ANGRY AT THEM FOR

01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:41.882
THAT THEY ARE FOR PROFIT

01:43:41.949 --> 01:43:43.216
BUSINESSES THAT'S WHAT THEY DO

01:43:43.283 --> 01:43:45.052
THEY MAKE MONEY -- AND THAT'S

01:43:45.118 --> 01:43:47.220
WHAT OUR JOB AS POLICY MAKERS TO

01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:48.689
MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT OUR

01:43:48.755 --> 01:43:51.558
VETERANS AS WELL AS OUR TAXPAYER

01:43:51.625 --> 01:43:52.526
DOLLARS.

01:43:52.593 --> 01:43:53.627
RIGHT NOW FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:55.362
HAVE VARIOUS TAXPAYER FUNDED

01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:56.863
SOURCES OF REVENUE.

01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:58.432
THAT TITLE FOR AID AND GI

01:43:58.498 --> 01:44:00.300
BENEFITS.

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:01.735
IN SOME CAL GRANTS AS WELL.

01:44:01.802 --> 01:44:04.037
WHILE WE CURRENTLY HAVE A NINETY

01:44:04.104 --> 01:44:05.772
TEN RULE FOR TITLE FOUR EIGHT A

01:44:05.839 --> 01:44:07.240
SEPARATE EIGHTY FIVE FIFTEEN

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:09.576
RULE FOR GI BILL BENEFITS DOES.

01:44:09.643 --> 01:44:11.144
TO REGULATIONS DON'T TALK TO

01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:12.212
EACH OTHER.

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:14.247
AND DON'T ADD UP TO A SINGLE

01:44:14.314 --> 01:44:14.982
AMOUNT.

01:44:15.048 --> 01:44:17.317
SO ESSENTIALLY SCHOOLS CAN BE A

01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:19.586
100% FUNDED BY GOVERNMENT

01:44:19.653 --> 01:44:22.255
DOLLARS BUT WITHOUT THE MANDATE

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:24.324
THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE.

01:44:24.391 --> 01:44:25.926
AND THAT'S NOT AGAIN IS NOT

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:26.727
THEIR ROLE TO POLICE THEMSELVES

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:28.328
THAT IS OUR ROLE AS POLICY

01:44:28.395 --> 01:44:30.130
MAKERS TO MAKE SURE OF THAT OUR

01:44:30.197 --> 01:44:30.964
VETERANS ARE.

01:44:31.031 --> 01:44:32.566
LEAVING THE SCHOOLS WITH HUGE

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:35.636
AMOUNTS OF DEBT THAT THEY NEED

01:44:35.702 --> 01:44:36.803
TO PAY BACK.

01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:38.071
AND THAT DEBT BEING OFF THE THE

01:44:38.138 --> 01:44:38.939
THEIR TUITION MEAN ALL FUNDED BY

01:44:39.006 --> 01:44:40.641
TAXPAYER DOLLARS.

01:44:40.707 --> 01:44:42.376
STEP APART FROM THE NEW YORK

01:44:42.442 --> 01:44:43.310
FEDERAL RESERVE.

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:44.911
IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:45.912
RESEARCH SHOW THAT THE LINK

01:44:45.979 --> 01:44:48.382
BETWEEN HOW MUCH SCHOOLS CHARGE

01:44:48.448 --> 01:44:50.384
AND HOW MUCH IS AVAILABLE.

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:54.087
IS DIRECTLY RELATED -- SO.

01:44:54.154 --> 01:44:55.756
THIS BILL SEEKS TO CONTAIN COSTS

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:58.725
TO AN 8515% RULE ON TAXPAYER

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:00.427
FUNDING -- IF SCHOOLS CAN'T MEET

01:45:00.494 --> 01:45:02.229
THAT THRESHOLD -- THEN WE ARE

01:45:02.295 --> 01:45:04.631
ASKING THAT 50% OF THEIR FUNDING

01:45:04.698 --> 01:45:06.433
OF THE MONEY THEY RECEIVE GO

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.135
DIRECTLY TO TUITION AND I AM

01:45:08.201 --> 01:45:09.903
MINDFUL THAT WE'RE STILL FIGURE

01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:12.272
OUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS --

01:45:12.339 --> 01:45:14.207
BUT WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL THAT

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:15.676
THAT MONEY.

01:45:15.742 --> 01:45:17.144
IS INTENDED FOR STUDENTS IT IS

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:18.845
NOT GOING TO SHAREHOLDER PROFITS

01:45:18.912 --> 01:45:20.347
AND TARGETED AT STUDENT

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:22.315
RECRUITMENT -- WE KNOW THAT

01:45:22.382 --> 01:45:23.483
THAT'S UP FOR FOR PROFIT

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.118
UNIVERSITIES THAT IS A HIGH

01:45:25.185 --> 01:45:25.986
THING THEY DO IS THEY GO AFTER

01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:27.721
STUDENTS THAT MONEY AT TAXPAYER

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:30.424
DOLLARS SHOULD BE GOING INTO THE

01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:30.857
TEACHING [inaudible]

WE COULD SET TUITION CAPS I

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:35.862
DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO DO

01:45:35.929 --> 01:45:37.130
THAT OR WE COULD MAKE SKIDS

01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:38.932

01:48:15.989 --> 01:48:17.791
OF DEFENSE FOR BUYING WEAPONS OR

BILLS FOR SOMEBODY THE HOSPITAL

01:48:21.394 --> 01:48:22.596
CONSENT A BILL IN THE GOVERNMENT

01:48:22.662 --> 01:48:23.864
TELLS THEM HOW MUCH THEY'RE

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:25.765
GOING TO PAY.

01:48:25.832 --> 01:48:26.633
SO WHEN IT COMES T THE

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:29.836
EDUCATION -- PRICES THIS IS SET

01:48:29.903 --> 01:48:31.338
IN THIS WAS DECIDED WITH NINETY

01:48:31.404 --> 01:48:32.939
TEN ROLL THIS IS SET.

01:48:33.006 --> 01:48:35.775
BY ENSURING THAT AT LEAST 10% OF

01:48:35.842 --> 01:48:37.244
PRIVATE DOLLARS NO MATTER WHERE

01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:38.945
IT COMES FROM IS SPENT AT THE

01:48:39.012 --> 01:48:40.146
SCHOOL FOR THIS PRODUCT

01:48:40.213 --> 01:48:41.548
OTHERWISE THE PRODUCT IS OVER

01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:42.782
PRICED.

01:48:42.849 --> 01:48:44.017
IF THE PRODUCT IS OVERPRICED AND

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:45.285
PEOPLE AREN'T SPENDING THEIR OWN

01:48:45.352 --> 01:48:46.853
DOLLARS ON THIS AND THERE IS A

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.188
DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:48:48.255 --> 01:48:49.256
SENDING SPENDING YOUR OWN

01:48:49.322 --> 01:48:51.424
DOLLARS AND SPENDING A VOUCHER

01:48:51.491 --> 01:48:52.559
THAT YOU RECEIVE THAT CAN BE

01:48:52.626 --> 01:48:54.261
USED FOR NOTHING ELSE EXCEPT FOR

01:48:54.327 --> 01:48:55.128
EDUCATION.

01:48:55.195 --> 01:48:57.364
SO THOSE OF THE THE WHAT THE

01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:58.665
PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS

01:48:58.732 --> 01:49:00.734
REGULATION SO IS TO ENSURE THAT

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.102
THE MARKET IS FUNCTIONING

01:49:02.168 --> 01:49:03.536
PROPERLY AND WE AREN'T

01:49:03.603 --> 01:49:05.138
DRASTICALLY OVER PRICING THESE

01:49:05.205 --> 01:49:07.307
WELL WE SCHOOL INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:08.575
DRASTICALLY OVER PRICING THE

01:49:08.642 --> 01:49:09.676
PRODUCT THAT THEY'RE OFFERING

01:49:09.743 --> 01:49:10.510
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CAN

01:49:10.577 --> 01:49:11.278
RECEIVE.

01:49:11.344 --> 01:49:13.179
FEDERAL TUITION DOLLARS FROM IT

01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:15.181
SECONDLY THIS IS GOING TO BE

01:49:15.248 --> 01:49:16.316
PROTECTING OUR VETERANS WHO

01:49:16.383 --> 01:49:17.684
RIGHT NOW ARE CAUGHT UP IN A

01:49:17.751 --> 01:49:19.653
LOOPHOLE THAT IS CAUSING

01:49:19.719 --> 01:49:20.921
PROBLEMS ACROSS THE ENTIRE

01:49:20.987 --> 01:49:22.422
COUNTRY VETERANS EDUCATION

01:49:22.489 --> 01:49:24.557
SUCCESS WE WORK WITH NEARLY NINE

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:25.558
THOUSAND VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:49:25.625 --> 01:49:30.864
DEFRAUDED BY FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS.

01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:32.632
ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY ON

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:33.300
IT'S OF THEM IN THIS VERY STATE.

01:49:33.366 --> 01:49:34.200
SO THE LOOPHOLE WAS CREATED

01:49:34.267 --> 01:49:34.768
BECAUSE THE NINETY TEN RULE

01:49:34.834 --> 01:49:35.969
STARTED IN THE NINETIES THE POST

01:49:36.036 --> 01:49:37.237
NINE ELEVEN GI BILL AND

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:38.805
VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION WHICH

01:49:38.872 --> 01:49:40.573
I USED TO GO TO SCHOOL WAS

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.509
CREATED IN THE AFTERWARDS IN THE

01:49:42.575 --> 01:49:43.843
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AFTER THE

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:45.478
INVASION OF IRAQ -- THE AFTER

01:49:45.545 --> 01:49:48.048
THE INVASION OF IRAQ -- SO.

01:49:48.114 --> 01:49:50.083
THAT BENEFIT AS WELL AS

01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:51.584
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MONEY AS

01:49:51.651 --> 01:49:53.353
WELL AS BY THE WAY -- FOSTER

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.221
CHILDREN BENEFITS -- DOESN'T

01:49:55.288 --> 01:49:56.656
FALL UNDER TITLE FOR WHICH IS

01:49:56.723 --> 01:49:59.225
HOW THE REGULATION DEFINES WHAT

01:49:59.292 --> 01:50:00.961
IS FEDERAL TUITION ASSISTANCE

01:50:01.027 --> 01:50:02.562
AND THAT'S HOW IT WAS IN THE

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:04.297
NINETIES BUT NOW IT'S DIFFERENT.

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:04.998
AND SO WE NEED TO BE

01:50:05.065 --> 01:50:06.633
INCORPORATING ALL OF THESE

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:07.200
DIFFERENT TYPES OF FEDERAL

01:50:07.267 --> 01:50:09.302
BENEFITS SO THAT THE REGULATION

01:50:09.369 --> 01:50:11.338
IS PROPERLY FUNCTIONING SO THAT

01:50:11.404 --> 01:50:12.872
WE'RE GETTING A PROPER PRICE.

01:50:12.939 --> 01:50:14.674
ON THE PRODUCT THAT IS BEING

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:15.809
DELIVERED AND IT'S NOT SET BY

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:17.344
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FEDERAL

01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:19.012
TUITION ASSISTANCE THAT THE

01:50:19.079 --> 01:50:20.280
SCHOOLS CAN GET.

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:21.014
A MINUTE.

01:50:21.081 --> 01:50:24.918
IF OF I MIGHT GO TO THE SECOND

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:26.553
WITNESS -- JUST TO MAKE SURE

01:50:26.619 --> 01:50:28.388
THAT WE GIVE EVERYONE THE

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:29.622
ALLOTTED TIME.

01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:32.659
MY APOLOGIES OKAY.

01:50:32.726 --> 01:50:34.594
CHECK -- AGAIN MY NAME IS ACTING

01:50:34.661 --> 01:50:36.096
AS YOU HEARD FROM THE EARLIER I

01:50:36.162 --> 01:50:37.797
WAS A ADVISER AT ASHFORD

01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:40.333
UNIVERSITY ICE OUT OF THE TWO

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.534
YEARS AND SEVEN MONTHS I SPENT

01:50:41.601 --> 01:50:43.503
THERE TWO POINT. TWO TWO YEARS

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:45.772
AND SIX AND FOUR MONTHS OF THAT

01:50:45.839 --> 01:50:47.474
WAS SPENT AS A MILITARY ADVISER.

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:48.842
ENROLLMENT SERVICES ADVISER FOR

01:50:48.908 --> 01:50:50.043
THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT.

01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:52.212
SO A BOOK OF MY WORK WAS CALLING

01:50:52.278 --> 01:50:54.914
THESE VETERANS EVERY SINGLE DAY

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:56.416
TO GET THEM TO ENROLL IN SCHOOL

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:57.717
AND I THINK THE MOST POWERFUL

01:50:57.784 --> 01:50:59.452
PART OF THIS IS THAT I WAS A

01:50:59.519 --> 01:50:59.719
VETERAN.

01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:01.554
AND BEFORE I WAS EMPLOYED AT

01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:03.156
ASHFORD WHEN EMPLOYED ME WITH

01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:04.591
ONLY THIRTY ONE COLLEGE CREDITS.

01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:06.760
I WAS NEARLY HOMELESS AND THAT

01:51:06.826 --> 01:51:07.727
WAS ONLY JOB IN SAN DIEGO THAT

01:51:07.794 --> 01:51:10.130
WOULD PAY OVER. SIXTEEN

01:51:10.196 --> 01:51:10.797
SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR THIRTY

01:51:10.864 --> 01:51:12.565
COLLEGE CREDITS SO I JUMPED IN

01:51:12.632 --> 01:51:15.835
MY BODY AND AND I STARTED SALES

01:51:15.902 --> 01:51:17.404
FOR FOR THE MILITARY -- AND I

01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:19.105
WOULD HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS

01:51:19.172 --> 01:51:19.739
WITH VETERANS STRUGGLING TO GET

01:51:19.806 --> 01:51:21.041
ON THEIR FEET TRANSITION JUST

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:23.009
LIKE I HAD SO I SAW SOMETHING IN

01:51:23.076 --> 01:51:23.376
THEM.

01:51:23.443 --> 01:51:25.612
AND I WANTED TO HELP THEM BUT I

01:51:25.678 --> 01:51:26.379
REALIZED LATER ON THAT AND

01:51:26.446 --> 01:51:27.714
ROLLING THEM INTO A FOR PROFIT

01:51:27.781 --> 01:51:29.115
UNIVERSITY WASN'T A BENEFIT TO

01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:30.717
THEM IT WAS DISENFRANCHISED

COST OF ATTENDANCE NUMBERS.

02:16:09.928 --> 02:16:10.395
HOW IS THIS AN ACCURATE

02:16:10.462 --> 02:16:11.763
ASSESSMENT IF THOSE STUDENTS ARE

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:13.164

PER MONTH FOR HOUSING ON AVERAGE.

02:16:17.836 --> 02:16:19.037

FOR EFFICIENCY UNIT?

02:16:23.141 --> 02:16:24.976
WE FIND THAT NINETEEN OF THE

02:16:25.043 --> 02:16:25.944
TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES

02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:27.212

02:16:27.279 --> 02:16:30.849
BY TWO THOUSAND TO EIGHT

02:16:30.916 --> 02:16:32.517
IN MY EDUCATION I'VE LEARNED.

02:16:32.584 --> 02:16:33.919
THAT THE VA EVERY SYSTEM IS

02:16:33.985 --> 02:16:36.154

RESULTS THAT IT ACHIEVES.

02:16:38.023 --> 02:16:39.524
THE RESULT HERE THAT WE HAVE AN

EPIDEMIC A STUDENT HOMELESSNESS

02:16:41.893 --> 02:16:43.028

02:16:48.433 --> 02:16:49.901
EXPENSIVE IT IS.

02:16:49.968 --> 02:16:50.602
BECAUSE THE NUMBERS THE

02:16:50.669 --> 02:16:52.237
FINANCIAL AID ADMINISTRATORS

02:16:52.304 --> 02:16:53.505
GIVE THEM.

02:16:53.572 --> 02:16:54.239
THE RESULT IS THAT THEY FEEL

02:16:54.306 --> 02:16:56.107
BETRAYED AND DISEMPOWERED BY

02:16:56.174 --> 02:16:57.976

IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT GET HELP

02:17:01.913 --> 02:17:03.815
FROM FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE

THAT THE SCHOOL WAS BEING CLOSED

INSTITUTIONS -- THERE'S TWO MAIN

02:29:21.018 --> 02:29:22.853
TIME FRAMES WHEN THE MISCHIEF

02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:23.788
OCCURS ONE IS DURING THE

02:29:23.854 --> 02:29:25.523
RECRUITMENT PROCESS AND ONE IS

02:29:25.589 --> 02:29:27.258

SQUARELY ADDRESSED SOME OF THE

02:29:28.259 --> 02:29:30.761

MY CLIENTS REPORT TO ME ALMOST

02:29:33.130 --> 02:29:35.066
UNIFORMLY -- THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

02:29:35.132 --> 02:29:36.901
SUBJECTED TO HIGH PRESSURE SALES

02:29:36.967 --> 02:29:39.503
TACTICS THAT INCLUDES DOZENS OF

02:29:39.570 --> 02:29:41.839
UNSOLICITED PHONE CALLS EMAILS

02:29:41.906 --> 02:29:44.108
LETTERS I'VE HAD CLIENTS WHO HAD

02:29:44.175 --> 02:29:45.843
RECRUITER SHOP AT THEIR HOUSES.

02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:46.844
SHOP AT THEIR PLACE OF BUSINESS

02:29:46.911 --> 02:29:48.112
TRYING TO GET THEM TO A ROLE IN

02:29:48.179 --> 02:29:49.046
THE SCHOOLS.

02:29:49.113 --> 02:29:50.114
AND THEY'VE BEEN LIED TO ABOUT

02:29:50.181 --> 02:29:51.315
ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU COULD

02:29:51.382 --> 02:29:52.683
POSSIBLY IMAGINE BEING LIED TO

02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:54.318
WITH RESPECT TO A PROGRAM.

02:29:54.385 --> 02:29:55.853
THEY'VE BEEN TOLD -- MIS

02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:57.488
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO JOB

02:29:57.555 --> 02:29:58.756
PLACEMENT RATES.

02:29:58.823 --> 02:30:00.324
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO

02:30:00.391 --> 02:30:01.692
BE ATTENDING AN ACCREDITED

02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:03.227
SCHOOL THE TOTAL LENGTH OF TIME

02:30:03.294 --> 02:30:04.495

02:30:04.562 --> 02:30:05.363
QUALIFICATIONS OF THE

02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:07.431
INSTRUCTORS AND THE MATERIAL

02:30:07.498 --> 02:30:09.300
THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE UTILIZING.

02:30:09.367 --> 02:30:09.900
I'VE EVEN HAD THAT EARNS WHO

02:30:09.967 --> 02:30:12.103
BEEN MISLED AS TO WHETHER THE

02:30:12.169 --> 02:30:12.670
SCHOOL COULD HAVE REASONABLY

02:30:12.737 --> 02:30:15.740
ACCOMMODATE THEIR SERIOUS

02:30:15.806 --> 02:30:16.374
SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITIES.

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:17.341
AND I THINK THE CRUX OF THE

02:30:17.408 --> 02:30:19.276
PROBLEM IS THAT THE FOR PROFIT

02:30:19.343 --> 02:30:22.113
SCHOOL MODEL HAS INCENTIVIZED

02:30:22.179 --> 02:30:23.647
BAD BEHAVIOR BY RECRUITERS.

02:30:23.714 --> 02:30:25.116
WHEN THE COMPENSATION AND

02:30:25.182 --> 02:30:27.451
VARIOUS AND SUNDRY OTHER RELATED

02:30:27.518 --> 02:30:28.886
ASPECTS OF THEIR?

02:30:28.953 --> 02:30:30.254
WOMEN ARE TIED TO HOW MANY

02:30:30.321 --> 02:30:32.056
STUDENTS CAN BE ENROLLED.

02:30:32.123 --> 02:30:33.691
BY THAT INDIVIDUAL RECRUITER

02:30:33.758 --> 02:30:34.792
IT'S ALMOST INEVITABLE THAT

02:30:34.859 --> 02:30:36.293
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS IN

02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:37.728
SO I BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL GO

02:30:37.795 --> 02:30:39.430
UP AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN

02:30:39.497 --> 02:30:41.298

02:33:58.329 --> 02:33:59.763
THERE ARE NO BONUSES.

02:33:59.830 --> 02:34:01.265
AND THEIR EXISTING FEDERAL LAW

02:34:01.332 --> 02:34:03.233
NO PERSON INVOLVED IN ANY WAY

02:34:03.300 --> 02:34:04.935
WITH ADMISSIONS OR FINANCIAL AID.

02:34:05.002 --> 02:34:06.904
NO THE SALARIES INCREASE OR

02:34:06.971 --> 02:34:08.973
DECREASED FOR SUCCESS OR FAILURE

02:34:09.039 --> 02:34:09.306
IN ADMISSION.

02:34:09.373 --> 02:34:16.380
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY.

02:34:16.447 --> 02:34:17.147
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE AND THE

02:34:17.214 --> 02:34:17.781
COMMITTEE REPORT DOESN'T CITE

02:34:17.848 --> 02:34:18.682
ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE

02:34:18.749 --> 02:34:19.416
ASSERTION. TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT

02:34:19.483 --> 02:34:19.783
DOESN'T EXIST.

02:34:19.850 --> 02:34:21.051
IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF DOING

02:34:21.118 --> 02:34:21.352
THIS WORK.

02:34:21.418 --> 02:34:22.553
REPRESENTING.

02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:23.721
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND

02:34:23.787 --> 02:34:24.788
HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLS OVER THE

02:34:24.855 --> 02:34:26.423
YEARS I NEVER ONCE SEEN A SCHOOL

02:34:26.490 --> 02:34:28.292
FOUND LIABLE. FOR PAYING

02:34:28.359 --> 02:34:29.560
COMMISSIONS OF ANY KIND AND I

02:34:29.627 --> 02:34:32.429
THINK THAT'LL PROBABLY BE AT

02:34:32.496 --> 02:34:33.931
LEAST ONE OF THE ONES TO KNOW.

02:34:33.998 --> 02:34:35.499
A POINT OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION

02:34:35.566 --> 02:34:36.467
HERE UNDER THE NEW FEDERAL AUDIT

02:34:36.533 --> 02:34:37.968
GUIDE IN ACTED LAST YEAR.

02:34:38.035 --> 02:34:39.803
THE CPA'S THAT HAVE TO ORDER THE

02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:40.804
SCHOOLS FOR COMPLAINTS EVERY

02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:42.506
YEAR A REQUIRED TO DO FORENSIC

02:34:42.573 --> 02:34:44.875
EXAMINATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER

02:34:44.942 --> 02:34:45.709
THERE IS ANY INCENTIVE

02:34:45.776 --> 02:34:47.411
COMPENSATION PAID.

02:34:47.478 --> 02:34:48.712
DOWN TO THE GENERAL LEDGER DOWN

02:34:48.779 --> 02:34:50.114
TO THE PAYROLL AND THEY LOOK

02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:51.281
PRETTY HARD IN THE RECORDS WOULD

02:34:51.348 --> 02:34:52.883
TEST INDEPENDENTLY OF THE

02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:55.219
ABSENCE OF INCENTIVE

02:34:55.285 --> 02:34:56.286
COMPENSATION.

02:34:56.353 --> 02:34:58.255
SO IT'S JUST NOT TRUE THAT ANY

02:34:58.322 --> 02:34:59.256
OF THE SCHOOLS RECENTLY CLOSED

02:34:59.323 --> 02:35:01.358
OR SOMETHING CLOSE TO WHILE AGO.

02:35:01.425 --> 02:35:02.459
HAD INSTEAD OF A COMMISSION

02:35:02.526 --> 02:35:04.061
INSTRUCTOR -- STRUCTURES IT'S

02:35:04.128 --> 02:35:04.828
IT'S REALLY A NONEXISTENT

02:35:04.895 --> 02:35:06.330
PROBLEM.

02:35:06.397 --> 02:35:07.965
THE TWIST OF THE CURRENT BILL.

02:35:08.032 --> 02:35:09.400
SINCE THE THE CONDUCT SPOKEN OF

02:35:09.466 --> 02:35:10.968
IS LARGELY PROHIBITED BY CURRENT

02:35:11.035 --> 02:35:13.203
LAW IS A TWIST THAT PROHIBIT

02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:14.471
SCHOOLS FROM TERMINATING THE

02:35:14.538 --> 02:35:16.874
EMPLOYEE THE IN THE EMPLOYMENT

02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:18.242
ADMISSIONS WRAPS -- WARP

02:35:18.308 --> 02:35:20.744
INSTRUCTORS THAT ARE

02:35:20.811 --> 02:35:21.712
UNSUCCESSFUL IN DOING YOUR JOB.

02:35:21.779 --> 02:35:22.913
NOW THAT THAT THAT SEEMS SILLY

02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:24.348
WOULD CREATE -- CLASPING PLEASE

02:35:24.415 --> 02:35:26.450
IN THE STATE THE ONLY EMPLOYEES

02:35:26.517 --> 02:35:28.152
IN THE STATE TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

02:35:28.218 --> 02:35:30.087
OF THAT WOULD KEEP THEIR JOBS NO

02:35:30.154 --> 02:35:30.688
MATTER HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE

02:35:30.754 --> 02:35:31.722
DOING IT.

02:35:31.789 --> 02:35:33.257
NO BUSINESS SHOULD HAVE TO KEEP

02:35:33.323 --> 02:35:34.758
AN EMPLOYEE THAT'S NOT COMPETENT.

02:35:34.825 --> 02:35:35.959
THIS IS AN ESTABLISHED RIGHT ON

02:35:36.026 --> 02:35:37.628
THE TITLE FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

02:35:37.695 --> 02:35:38.829
APPROVED IT IN THE POT VERSUS

02:35:38.896 --> 02:35:40.197
SILICON VALLEY CASE QUITE

02:35:40.264 --> 02:35:41.565
SOMETIME AGO.

02:35:41.632 --> 02:35:42.900
THINK OF IT LIKE A SMOG STATION

02:35:42.966 --> 02:35:44.435
IF IT MAKES SENSE TO BAN

02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:46.570
COMMISSIONS THAT MECHANICS GIVE

02:35:46.637 --> 02:35:48.038
PEOPLE A PASS WHEN THEIR CARS TO

02:35:48.105 --> 02:35:49.273
PASS.

02:35:49.339 --> 02:35:50.474
BUT MAKES NO SENSE TO REQUIRE

02:35:50.541 --> 02:35:51.909
THAT IN THAT MECHANICS WHO CAN'T

02:35:51.975 --> 02:35:56.580
REPAIR CARS SHE KEEP THEIR JOBS.

02:35:56.647 --> 02:35:58.182
STATE AM I HEARD IN THE FOLKS

02:35:58.248 --> 02:35:59.550
THAT CAME BEFORE ME ABOUT THIS

02:35:59.616 --> 02:36:00.350
WAS A BAD ACTS.

02:36:00.417 --> 02:36:01.518
MISSIONS WITH THIS BILL DOESN'T

02:36:01.585 --> 02:36:02.419
SPEAK TO THAT THE LAW BOTH

02:36:02.486 --> 02:36:03.687
FEDERAL AND STATE ALREADY

02:36:03.754 --> 02:36:05.289
PROHIBIT MISREPRESENTATIONS OF

02:36:05.355 --> 02:36:06.590
ANY KIND OF MISSIONS.

02:36:06.657 --> 02:36:07.725
IN THE RECENT CLOSURES OF

02:36:07.791 --> 02:36:09.626
TERRIBLE ARE NOT ADMISSIONS

02:36:09.693 --> 02:36:11.328
ISSUES IN ANY OF THAT

02:36:11.395 --> 02:36:12.296
THERE'S JUST NO EVIDENCE NONE

02:36:12.362 --> 02:36:14.498
THAT IMMUNIZING EMPLOYEES FROM --

02:36:14.565 --> 02:36:16.533
IT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS WOULD

02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:17.901
HAVE A BENEFICIAL RESULT.

02:36:17.968 --> 02:36:19.436
THE REPORT ALSO REFERS TO ONE

02:36:19.503 --> 02:36:21.238
PROVEN ANECDOTES ABOUT SUPPOSE

02:36:21.305 --> 02:36:22.039
IT ILL TREATMENT OF ADMISSIONS

02:36:22.106 --> 02:36:22.940
RAPS.

02:36:23.006 --> 02:36:24.308
IN AN UNEDUCATED ATTORNEY

02:36:24.374 --> 02:36:26.443
GENERAL LAWSUIT -- I THINK

02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:28.445
MAKING POLICY BY ANECDOTE

02:36:28.512 --> 02:36:28.979
PROBABLY ISN'T THE WAY TO

02:36:29.046 --> 02:36:31.148
PROCEED ONE FINAL POINT AND THEN

02:36:31.215 --> 02:36:32.583
I'LL CONCLUDE HERE ABOUT OTHER

02:36:32.649 --> 02:36:34.084
BAD CONSEQUENCES.

02:36:34.151 --> 02:36:35.886
FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS AND AND I

02:36:35.953 --> 02:36:37.154
WOULD ASK YOU TO WRAP IT UP YES

02:36:37.221 --> 02:36:38.789
SIR -- FEDERAL LAW PERMITS

02:36:38.856 --> 02:36:40.290
SCHOOLS TO CONTRACT WITH SERVICE

02:36:40.357 --> 02:36:41.558
ENTITIES TO HELP WITH A VARIETY

02:36:41.625 --> 02:36:43.127

BUNDLED SERVICES.

02:36:46.964 --> 02:36:48.365
THIS BILL WOULD BLOW UP THOSE

02:36:48.432 --> 02:36:49.833
PERFECTLY LEGAL AGREEMENTS WHICH

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:51.568
RUN OFFENSIVE AND NOT IMPLICATED

02:36:51.635 --> 02:36:52.803
IN ANY MISCONDUCT.

02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:53.971

WRONG THE PROBLEM WITH SIX TO TO

02:36:59.042 --> 02:37:00.577
TO ELIMINATE HAS ALREADY BEEN

02:37:00.644 --> 02:37:02.446
OUTLAWED AND IT'S NOTHING NEW.

THIS GUY.

02:37:51.695 --> 02:37:54.097
A FOR THE OPPOSITION WITNESS I

02:37:54.164 --> 02:37:55.699
I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHERE HE WENT

02:37:55.766 --> 02:37:58.335
HE'S A GROCER YES I THINK YOU --

02:37:58.402 --> 02:38:00.704
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:01.471
YOUR ARGUMENT.

02:38:01.538 --> 02:38:03.473
YOU'RE SAYING THAT -- THE SIR

02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:04.975
PRACTICES OF THIS BILL IS --

02:38:05.042 --> 02:38:06.944
SEEKING A REGULATOR ALREADY --

02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:07.945
FORBIDDEN BUT YOU THINK THAT

02:38:08.011 --> 02:38:09.413
THIS BILL WOULD WOULD SORT OF GO

02:38:09.479 --> 02:38:11.315
A STEP FURTHER AND AND OUTLAW

02:38:11.381 --> 02:38:12.983
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS CAN YOU

02:38:13.050 --> 02:38:13.650
EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE WHAT YOU

02:38:13.717 --> 02:38:14.384
MEAN BY THAT WHAT KIND OF

02:38:14.451 --> 02:38:15.986
LEGITIMATE PRACTICES THIS WITH

02:38:16.053 --> 02:38:16.587
INCREDIBLE.

02:38:16.653 --> 02:38:18.188
YES SIR THE COMMISSIONING IS

02:38:18.255 --> 02:38:19.456
ALREADY ILLEGAL UNDER BOTH STATE

02:38:19.523 --> 02:38:20.858
AND FEDERAL LAW.

02:38:20.924 --> 02:38:22.459
THE THE THE THE PROVISIONS IS

02:38:22.526 --> 02:38:23.594
BUILT TO THAT EXTENT ARE

02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:24.761
REDUNDANT OF EXISTING LAW AND

02:38:24.828 --> 02:38:26.230
HAD NOTHING.

02:38:26.296 --> 02:38:27.898
THIS BILL GOES A LITTLE FURTHER

02:38:27.965 --> 02:38:29.433
AND TALKED ABOUT.

02:38:29.499 --> 02:38:31.268
HAVING IT MAINTAINING EMPLOYMENT

02:38:31.335 --> 02:38:33.070
OF PEOPLE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

02:38:33.136 --> 02:38:35.239
STUDENTS THEY ENROLL OR IT USES

02:38:35.305 --> 02:38:37.140
THE WORD QUOTA IS A LOADED TERM.

02:38:37.207 --> 02:38:38.909
BUT BASICALLY IS IS A CIRCUIT

02:38:38.976 --> 02:38:40.310
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.

02:38:40.377 --> 02:38:42.012
THE IDEA I THINK OF OF THE

02:38:42.079 --> 02:38:43.881
ADVOCATES IS THAT THE ADMISSIONS

02:38:43.947 --> 02:38:45.282
REP SHOULDN'T BE A SHOULD BE

02:38:45.349 --> 02:38:46.416
ABLE TO KEEP THEIR JOBS EVEN IF

02:38:46.483 --> 02:38:47.718
THEY CAN'T ENROLL STUDENTS.

02:38:47.784 --> 02:38:49.353
AND THE IDEA I THINK BEHIND IT

02:38:49.419 --> 02:38:50.354
IS THAT.

02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:51.889
THE THE FEAR OF LOSING YOUR JOB

02:38:51.955 --> 02:38:53.891
CAUSES PEOPLE TO SAY AND DO BAD

02:38:53.957 --> 02:38:55.759
THINGS I SUSPECT THAT THE THE

02:38:55.826 --> 02:38:57.694
THE THE SHORTHAND WAY TO DO IT.

02:38:57.761 --> 02:38:59.463
OBVIOUSLY BAD ACTOR READY MISS

02:38:59.529 --> 02:39:01.365
REPRESENTATION ABUSIVE ACTS AND

02:39:01.431 --> 02:39:03.133
OTHER ALSO THE DECEPTIVE ACTS

02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:09.273
ALREADY ILLEGAL.

02:39:09.339 --> 02:39:10.440
BUT MY POINT SIR IS THAT.

02:39:10.507 --> 02:39:12.142
A BUSINESS OUGHT TO BE A MISSION

02:39:12.209 --> 02:39:13.043
TRIP JOBS TO ENROLL STUDENTS.

02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:14.711
THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT OUT THERE

02:39:14.778 --> 02:39:15.312
WITH PRESS GANGS PULLING METAL

02:39:15.379 --> 02:39:15.913
BARS THE RULING OF THESE ARE

02:39:15.979 --> 02:39:16.546
STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN

02:39:16.613 --> 02:39:17.714
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ALLOWED

02:39:17.781 --> 02:39:18.015
TO ENROLL.

02:39:18.081 --> 02:39:19.149
IN THESE LEGITIMATE AND LEGAL

02:39:19.216 --> 02:39:21.051
PROGRAMS IT ADMISSIONS REP CAN'T%

02:39:21.118 --> 02:39:22.786
SUCCEED IN DOING THAT.

02:39:22.853 --> 02:39:24.254
NOT COPIES DO THEIR JOB.

02:39:24.321 --> 02:39:25.789
NOW THE IDEA I I THINK OF MY

02:39:25.856 --> 02:39:26.757
FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE IS

02:39:26.823 --> 02:39:27.257
THAT.

02:39:27.324 --> 02:39:29.493
THOSE INCENTIVES ARE BAD AND

02:39:29.559 --> 02:39:31.561
THAT THE IF IF THOSE INCENTIVES

02:39:31.628 --> 02:39:32.362
ARE ELIMINATED THEY'LL BEHAVE

02:39:32.429 --> 02:39:33.730
BETTER.

02:39:33.797 --> 02:39:34.398
AND THEREFORE THESE ABUSES WON'T

02:39:34.464 --> 02:39:35.933
OCCUR I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

02:39:35.999 --> 02:39:37.167
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT.

02:39:37.234 --> 02:39:39.002
AND THE BAD CONDUCT IS ALREADY

02:39:39.069 --> 02:39:41.004
UNLAWFUL IN OTHER WAYS.

02:39:41.071 --> 02:39:42.506
NO BUSINESS SHOULD HAVE TO KEEP

02:39:42.572 --> 02:39:43.240
EMPLOYEES THAT THEY CAN'T DO

02:39:43.307 --> 02:39:45.842
THEIR JOB -- I I I LOOK IS HARD

AND STATE LAW SURE YES I WOULD

02:41:44.094 --> 02:41:45.395
BE CURRENT VERSION OF THE

02:41:45.462 --> 02:41:47.130
CALIFORNIA LAW DEFERS TO THE

OR SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL RULE

02:41:52.035 --> 02:41:53.503

02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:54.938
AFFECT WHAT WE SEEN OVER THE

02:41:55.005 --> 02:41:57.274
LAST TWENTY YEARS IS THAT THE

02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:58.909
BUSH ADMINISTRATION BASICALLY

02:41:58.975 --> 02:42:00.077
TOLD SCHOOLS WERE NOT REALLY

02:42:00.143 --> 02:42:01.611

CLOSE TO THE LINE PROBABLY

02:42:09.453 --> 02:42:10.787
CROSSING THE LINE AND THEN IN

02:42:10.854 --> 02:42:12.189
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THERE

02:42:12.255 --> 02:42:14.257

02:52:44.187 --> 02:52:44.987
STUDENTS.

02:52:45.054 --> 02:52:46.355
IT EMPOWERS THE BEER TO TAKE

CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE AT RISK

02:52:49.192 --> 02:52:50.293

TO CATCH THEM OPERATING

03:00:51.807 --> 03:00:53.042
ILLEGALLY SO AFTER A FEW DAYS

03:00:53.108 --> 03:00:55.010
UPON THE APPLICANT THAT THEY

03:00:55.077 --> 03:00:57.680
HAVE TO READ A SELF MONITOR WITH

03:00:57.746 --> 03:00:59.281
HIS -- WITH HIS CHILDREN IS

03:00:59.348 --> 03:01:00.416
COMING FROM IT YEAH THAT'S

03:01:00.482 --> 03:01:01.884
EXACTLY RIGHT EXISTING LAW DOES

03:01:01.951 --> 03:01:03.719
ALREADY REQUIRE A REGISTRATION

03:01:03.786 --> 03:01:05.688
PROCESS THAT IS ALREADY EMBODIED

03:01:05.754 --> 03:01:06.956
IN EXISTING LOT THIS WOULD

03:01:07.022 --> 03:01:08.924
SIMPLY IMPROVE THE REGISTRATION

03:01:08.991 --> 03:01:10.492
PROCESS AND AT SEVERAL KEY

03:01:10.559 --> 03:01:12.261
PROTECTIONS TO THE EXISTING

03:01:12.328 --> 03:01:13.796
REGISTRATION PROCESS.

03:01:13.862 --> 03:01:15.331
BUT IT THE STATE DOES HAVE THE

03:01:15.397 --> 03:01:16.899
AUTHORITY TO CREATE THE

03:01:16.966 --> 03:01:19.768
REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY BUSINESS TO

03:01:19.835 --> 03:01:22.204
OPERATE AND TO SELL ITS WARES IN

03:01:22.271 --> 03:01:23.772
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:01:23.839 --> 03:01:25.908
EDUCATION IS NO DIFFERENT -- AS

03:01:25.975 --> 03:01:27.643
AD AND USED TO THE GREAT LAWYER

03:01:27.710 --> 03:01:30.412
EXAMPLE AND YOU HAVE TO BE YOU

03:01:30.479 --> 03:01:31.914
HAVE TO BE BARRED BY THE STATE

03:01:31.981 --> 03:01:33.382
OF CALIFORNIA BY THE BAR.

03:01:33.449 --> 03:01:35.150
OF CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO

03:01:35.217 --> 03:01:36.518
OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA AND SO YOU

03:01:36.585 --> 03:01:38.687
DO THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER AREAS

03:01:38.754 --> 03:01:39.488
WHERE THIS IS ALREADY A

03:01:39.555 --> 03:01:40.756
REQUIREMENT THERE ARE LOTS OF

03:01:40.823 --> 03:01:44.827
PARALLELS.

03:01:44.893 --> 03:01:47.396
SO YES THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT.

03:01:47.463 --> 03:01:48.731
AMONG THE FIVE ITEMS SO THEY ARE

03:01:48.797 --> 03:01:50.933
I SEE -- ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.769
IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE -- ON

03:01:53.836 --> 03:01:56.639
WHEN THE BUREAU ON NONPROFIT THE

03:01:56.705 --> 03:01:58.707
POST SECONDARY EDUCATION B. P.

03:01:58.774 --> 03:01:59.875
P..

03:01:59.942 --> 03:02:03.112
A RECEIVE SO THIS FIVE DOCUMENTS.

03:02:03.178 --> 03:02:06.282
CAN THEY MAKE A JUDGMENT THAT

03:02:06.348 --> 03:02:09.251
THEY FINANCIAL STABILITY.

03:02:09.318 --> 03:02:10.953
WHETHER THAT THE SCHOOL OR

03:02:11.020 --> 03:02:15.291
SUSTAIN THOUGH WOULD LOCK WILL

03:02:15.357 --> 03:02:16.225
NOT CLOSE NEXT YEAR.

03:02:16.292 --> 03:02:16.759
SO RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO

03:02:16.825 --> 03:02:19.094
INFORMATION ON THAT PROVIDED --

03:02:19.161 --> 03:02:20.596
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE SOME

03:02:20.663 --> 03:02:23.098
SELF REPORTING ON ANY ON SEVERAL

03:02:23.165 --> 03:02:25.467
INDICATORS OF RED FLAGS PROBLEMS

03:02:25.534 --> 03:02:26.502
AT THE SCHOOL WHETHER THEY'RE

03:02:26.568 --> 03:02:28.203
UNDER INVESTIGATION WHETHER THEY

03:02:28.270 --> 03:02:28.737
HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR

03:02:28.804 --> 03:02:30.639
ACCREDITATION -- WHETHER THE

03:02:30.706 --> 03:02:32.341
STATE OR FEDERAL EDGE AGENCY IS

03:02:32.408 --> 03:02:34.076
LOOKING INTO ISSUES AT THE

03:02:34.143 --> 03:02:37.179
SCHOOL -- THEIR FINANCIAL THAT

03:02:37.246 --> 03:02:38.914
STABILITY SCORE WHICH IS WHICH

03:02:38.981 --> 03:02:40.082
IS OF COURSE NOT ONE OF THOSE

03:02:40.149 --> 03:02:42.451
REQUIREMENTS -- BUT THAT THERE

03:02:42.518 --> 03:02:44.353
ARE SEVERAL OTHER REQUIREMENTS

03:02:44.420 --> 03:02:46.655
THAT WOULD INDICATE RISK

03:02:46.722 --> 03:02:49.258
STUDENTS THAT ARE INCLUDED.

03:02:49.325 --> 03:02:51.727
YEAH THESE THESE ARE -- GOOD THE

03:02:51.794 --> 03:02:53.662
MANAGER SAID TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:02:53.729 --> 03:02:55.631
THE STUDENTS WERE NOT BECOME A

03:02:55.698 --> 03:02:57.066

03:32:47.488 --> 03:32:48.822

03:36:25.238 --> 03:36:26.840
VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE BILL I

03:36:26.907 --> 03:36:29.409
JUST WANT TO ADD WHY THE BILL IF

03:36:29.476 --> 03:36:32.479
PASSED WILL INCENTIVIZE COLLEGES

03:36:32.546 --> 03:36:34.881
TO OFFER MORE DISTANCE EDUCATION.

03:36:34.948 --> 03:36:38.318
ONLINE NONCREDIT OFFERINGS --

03:36:38.385 --> 03:36:40.187
TRADITIONALLY NON CREDIT SERVICE

03:36:40.253 --> 03:36:41.321
ON TRADITIONAL STUDENT

03:36:41.388 --> 03:36:43.590
POPULATIONS AND THAT MEANS

03:36:43.657 --> 03:36:45.225
TYPICALLY OLDER STUDENTS WAS

03:36:45.292 --> 03:36:47.794
MANY WORK AND FAMILY PRIORITIES.

03:36:47.861 --> 03:36:49.262
THOSE THAT SOMETIMES CAN NOT

03:36:49.329 --> 03:36:51.765
COMMITTED TO IN PERSON STUDIES

03:36:51.832 --> 03:36:54.501

EITHER FROM THEIR HOME OR EVEN

03:36:56.336 --> 03:36:58.672
WORKPLACE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE

03:36:58.739 --> 03:37:00.707
PERCENTAGE OF ONLINE OFFERINGS

03:37:00.774 --> 03:37:02.242
FOR NON CREDIT IS VERY LOW RIGHT

03:37:02.309 --> 03:37:03.410
NOW IN THE STATE.

03:37:03.477 --> 03:37:04.778
IN COMPARISON TO THAT OF CREDIT

03:37:04.845 --> 03:37:07.280
YET WE PROVIDE COMPETENCY BASED

03:37:07.347 --> 03:37:09.716
FLEXIBLE EDUCATION THE REASON

03:37:09.783 --> 03:37:12.152
WHY IS BECAUSE THE ATTENDANCE

03:37:12.219 --> 03:37:13.553
COLLECTING FORMALIZE VERY

03:37:13.620 --> 03:37:15.722
CUMBERSOME FOR ONLINE NONCREDIT

03:37:15.789 --> 03:37:16.990
OFFERINGS.

03:37:17.057 --> 03:37:18.725
IT IS SENSES BASED BUT IT

03:37:18.792 --> 03:37:20.460
REQUIRES TWO SENSES DATES SO WE

03:37:20.527 --> 03:37:22.229
HAVE TO MEASURE ATTENDANCE AT

03:37:22.295 --> 03:37:23.230
THE BEGINNING AND AT THE END OF

03:37:23.296 --> 03:37:24.431
THE TERM THAT WE HAVE TO AVERAGE

03:37:24.498 --> 03:37:25.365
IT OUT.

03:37:25.432 --> 03:37:27.200
AND MULTIPLIED BY THE LENGTH OF

03:37:27.267 --> 03:37:29.302
THE TERM SO -- IT'S VERY

03:37:29.369 --> 03:37:31.605
CUMBERSOME LABOR INTENSIVE AND

03:37:31.671 --> 03:37:33.106
FOR MANY COLLEGES IT REQUIRES

03:37:33.173 --> 03:37:35.041
CREATION OF A PARALLEL AND

SEE FIT AND THIS WILL BE A

03:58:45.077 --> 03:58:46.645
MANDATE FOR EVERY CAMPUS TO

03:58:46.712 --> 03:58:48.380
DEVELOP A POLICY.

03:58:48.447 --> 03:58:49.648
RATHER THAN ACCEPTING THE U.

C.'S POLICY OR THE C. ISSUES

03:58:51.617 --> 03:58:52.518
POLICY.

03:58:52.584 --> 03:58:53.419
IT'S ONE TO WRITE A DIFFERENT

03:58:53.485 --> 03:58:55.487

THEM TO DO A STATEMENT.

03:59:16.375 --> 03:59:16.875
THAT'S RIGHT OKAY FOR EACH

CAMPUS AND AND WE DID THAT

03:59:18.277 --> 03:59:20.245
BEFORE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO IN

FACT -- DONE JUST THAT AS I

03:59:26.251 --> 03:59:27.453
MENTIONED UC BERKELEY THE OTHER

03:59:27.519 --> 03:59:29.288
ONES RESOLUTION NOW WE ACTUALLY

AND THIS BILL ACTUALLY I PASSED --

03:59:33.192 --> 03:59:35.227
IN A SIMILAR -- SIMILAR BILL

03:59:35.294 --> 03:59:36.628
LAST YEAR THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE

03:59:36.695 --> 03:59:37.830
UNANIMOUSLY OKAY AND THEN WHAT

03:59:37.896 --> 03:59:42.000
HAPPENED TO IT -- APPROPRIATIONS

03:59:42.067 --> 03:59:46.238
OKAY -- AND AND YOU HAD

03:59:46.305 --> 03:59:47.840
DIFFICULTY WITH WAS GONZALEZ'S

03:59:47.906 --> 03:59:49.108
REQUESTED.

03:59:49.174 --> 03:59:49.708
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME FREEDOM

03:59:49.775 --> 03:59:51.176
OF SPEECH AND I'M I WAS IN FAVOR

03:59:51.243 --> 03:59:52.244
OF THIS UNTIL ALL THAT STARTED

03:59:52.311 --> 03:59:54.413
BUT SEEM TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH

03:59:54.480 --> 03:59:55.814
WOULD WOULD MAKE SCULLY ONE OF

03:59:55.881 --> 03:59:56.648
THE THINGS WE WOULD TRY TO

03:59:56.715 --> 03:59:57.883
GUARANTEE IS THAT THOSE WHO

03:59:57.950 --> 03:59:59.418
EXPRESS THEMSELVES WOULD NOT.

03:59:59.485 --> 04:00:01.620
SUFFER ANY RETALIATION AS A

04:00:01.687 --> 04:00:02.421
RESULT OF WHAT THEY EXPRESS I

04:00:02.488 --> 04:00:03.322
MEAN.

04:00:03.388 --> 04:00:04.723
THAT'S GENERALLY THE CONCEPT OF

04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:08.894
FREEDOM OF SPEECH OTHERWISE IT'S

04:00:08.961 --> 04:00:10.629
NOT FREE IS IS THERE.

04:00:10.696 --> 04:00:11.497
THE COURT I I'M TRYING TO FIGURE

04:00:11.563 --> 04:00:12.164
OUT ALL RIGHT THE CONTROVERSY IS

04:00:12.231 --> 04:00:14.032
SO I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE --

04:00:14.099 --> 04:00:16.635
EXACTLY WHAT MS GONZALEZ WAS

04:00:16.702 --> 04:00:18.070
ASKING FOR BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T

04:00:18.137 --> 04:00:19.371
SAY.

04:00:19.438 --> 04:00:22.441
RETALIATION BY WHO OR RIGHT NOW

04:00:22.508 --> 04:00:25.177
IF YOU'RE ON THE CAMPUS I

04:00:25.244 --> 04:00:27.513
BELIEVE YOU'RE PROTECTED.

04:00:27.579 --> 04:00:29.548
WITH THE DC MINISTRATION ALLOWED

04:00:29.615 --> 04:00:32.317
WHO WHO DO YOU WANT TO PROTECT.

04:00:32.384 --> 04:00:34.219
THAT'S THE QUESTION FOR ME I

04:00:34.286 --> 04:00:35.954
WANT TO PROTECT UNDOCUMENTED

04:00:36.021 --> 04:00:38.791
UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WHO WE

04:00:38.857 --> 04:00:40.626
INVITE ONTO OUR CAMPUSES TO FEEL

04:00:40.692 --> 04:00:42.761
THAT THEY ALSO HAVE THE THE

04:00:42.828 --> 04:00:44.396
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND MAKE SURE

04:00:44.463 --> 04:00:45.664
THAT THAT IS.

04:00:45.731 --> 04:00:47.432
IS PUT OUT THERE -- I I DON'T

04:00:47.499 --> 04:00:49.001
THINK THAT THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL

04:00:49.067 --> 04:00:51.804
DON'T WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS THAT

04:00:51.870 --> 04:00:52.905
AFFECT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A

04:00:52.971 --> 04:00:55.774
UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION.

04:00:55.841 --> 04:00:57.276
DON'T THEY HAVE TO RESPECT THE

04:00:57.342 --> 04:00:59.178
RIGHTS FOR OF THE I I KNOW IT'S

04:00:59.244 --> 04:01:00.679
AT LEAST POLICY.

04:01:00.746 --> 04:01:02.981
THAT THEY RESPECT THAT SO I'M

04:01:03.048 --> 04:01:04.616
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOUR WE

04:01:04.683 --> 04:01:05.884
ALREADY HAVE A WORRIED ABOUT WE

04:01:05.951 --> 04:01:06.652
ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHT TO

04:01:06.718 --> 04:01:08.320
FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS WELL WHAT I

04:01:08.387 --> 04:01:09.888
WANT TO ENSURE IS THAT THESE

04:01:09.955 --> 04:01:10.923
STUDENTS.

04:01:10.989 --> 04:01:12.391
WHO -- WHO MIGHT FEEL

04:01:12.457 --> 04:01:13.926
INTIMIDATED OTHERWISE IT

04:01:13.992 --> 04:01:16.428
ESPECIALLY GIVEN AT THE KIND OF

04:01:16.495 --> 04:01:17.830
GROUPS WHO ARE PRESSING FOR THIS?

04:01:17.896 --> 04:01:19.731
NEW STEP THAT THAT IT IS ALREADY

04:01:19.798 --> 04:01:21.533
RESTATING LAW THAT THEY ALSO

04:01:21.600 --> 04:01:24.102
FEEL PROTECTED BECAUSE I I WOULD.

04:01:24.169 --> 04:01:26.171
I BE CONCERNED THAT THEY GIVE IN

04:01:26.238 --> 04:01:28.040
THE GENESIS OF OF THIS NEW

04:01:28.106 --> 04:01:30.475
PROFOUND MOVEMENT THAT WE HAVE --

04:01:30.542 --> 04:01:31.677
SOME STUDENTS WHO DO NOT FEEL

04:01:31.743 --> 04:01:33.445
WELCOME ON CAMPUS AND WON'T KNOW

04:01:33.512 --> 04:01:34.980

BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF HOW WE

WE GOT HERE.

04:02:57.062 --> 04:02:59.164
AND WHY MR KYLIE'S BRINGING THIS

04:02:59.231 --> 04:03:04.603
BILL FORWARD -- AS GENTLEMEN

04:03:04.670 --> 04:03:05.804
STATED.

04:03:05.871 --> 04:03:07.339
YOU KNOW I I I WAS A COLLEGE

04:03:07.406 --> 04:03:09.207
STUDENT -- REMIND PEOPLE IN THE

04:03:09.274 --> 04:03:11.310
SEVENTIES WHERE WE VERY MUCH

04:03:11.376 --> 04:03:13.512
VALUE OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

04:03:13.578 --> 04:03:15.981
AND IT WAS IN THE LATE SIXTIES

04:03:16.048 --> 04:03:18.183
RIGHT IN THE LATE SIXTIES AT AT

04:03:18.250 --> 04:03:20.352
BERKELEY WHERE MY AUDIO SAVI ON

04:03:20.419 --> 04:03:22.087
THE FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT BEGAN.

04:03:22.154 --> 04:03:23.722
AND AND I AM.

04:03:23.789 --> 04:03:25.290
PROUD TO SAY THAT MY YOU SAW THE

04:03:25.357 --> 04:03:28.126
CAME TO MY CAMPUS UC RIVERSIDE

04:03:28.193 --> 04:03:29.895
SOMETIME BEFORE I GOT THERE BUT

04:03:29.962 --> 04:03:30.929
HE WAS THERE.

04:03:30.996 --> 04:03:32.564
AND THEN I GO BACK TO BERKELEY

04:03:32.631 --> 04:03:33.932
AND I STAND IN THE PLACE WHERE

04:03:33.999 --> 04:03:35.834
MY IDEAS OBVIO BEGAN THE FREE

04:03:35.901 --> 04:03:37.669
SPEECH MOVEMENT AND THAT'S THE

04:03:37.736 --> 04:03:39.071
HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA.

04:03:39.137 --> 04:03:42.341
WE ALL BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECH --

04:03:42.407 --> 04:03:46.211
ESPECIALLY IN HIGHER EDUCATION

04:03:46.278 --> 04:03:48.280
HOWEVER -- AND WHY WE ARE HERE

04:03:48.347 --> 04:03:51.216
IS BECAUSE IT HAS.

04:03:51.283 --> 04:03:53.418
AS I THINK THE AUTHOR.

04:03:53.485 --> 04:03:56.621
INDICATED YOU KNOW COME UP AGAIN

04:03:56.688 --> 04:03:59.458
BY STUDENTS AND INVITING THIS

04:03:59.524 --> 04:04:03.428
INVITING SECURITY AND SO IT IT I

04:04:03.495 --> 04:04:06.398
THINK WE HAD TWO BILLS LAST YEAR.

04:04:06.465 --> 04:04:10.135
ON FREE SPEECH AND AND I VERY

04:04:10.202 --> 04:04:12.404
MUCH PREFERRED THIS WENT TO THE

04:04:12.471 --> 04:04:13.805
ALTERNATIVE.

04:04:13.872 --> 04:04:16.041
A BILL THAT WAS OFFERED AND SO

04:04:16.108 --> 04:04:18.543
WE SUPPOTED THIS BILL -- I I

04:04:18.610 --> 04:04:20.445
THINK IT IS.

04:04:20.512 --> 04:04:22.447
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL --

04:04:22.514 --> 04:04:25.517
IT ENJOYS A SUPPORT POSITION OF

04:04:25.584 --> 04:04:27.586
A PASS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE

04:04:27.652 --> 04:04:28.587
LAST YEAR.

04:04:28.653 --> 04:04:30.822
I I I I AS THE CHAIR THINK IT

04:04:30.889 --> 04:04:32.591
SHOULD A PASS OUT OF COMMITTEE

04:04:32.657 --> 04:04:35.660
THIS YEAR AND I JUST HEARD --

04:04:35.727 --> 04:04:37.996
OUR COLLEAGUE MR QUIRK OFFERED

04:04:38.063 --> 04:04:41.233
TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND

04:04:41.299 --> 04:04:41.833
I AM.

04:04:41.900 --> 04:04:44.803
MIGHT HOPE THAT THAT HAPPENS.

04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:46.171
I I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS

04:04:46.238 --> 04:04:47.606
VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I THINK

04:04:47.672 --> 04:04:50.108
MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT -- THE

04:04:50.175 --> 04:04:51.076
PURPOSE IS THE FIRST MAN OR

04:04:51.143 --> 04:04:52.511
PROTECT PROTECT ALL SPEECH AND

04:04:52.577 --> 04:04:53.779
IT'S ESPECIALLY SPEECH THAT'S ON

04:04:53.845 --> 04:04:55.380
POPULAR OR FROM PEOPLE THAT THE

04:04:55.447 --> 04:04:56.481
MAJORITY MAY NOT WANT TO HEAR

04:04:56.548 --> 04:04:57.849
FROM IT SO.

04:04:57.916 --> 04:04:59.551
I I THINK THE INTENTION -- I'M

04:04:59.618 --> 04:05:00.385
GONNA SURMISE HEAR FROM OUR

04:05:00.452 --> 04:05:02.087
COLLEAGUE IS THAT SOMETIMES

04:05:02.154 --> 04:05:03.455
CONSERVATIVE STUDENTS ONLINE

04:05:03.522 --> 04:05:05.257
LIBERAL CAMPUSES MIGHT NOT FEEL

04:05:05.323 --> 04:05:05.857
COMFORTABLE EXPRESSING THEIR

04:05:05.924 --> 04:05:06.625
OPINION.

04:05:06.691 --> 04:05:07.626
AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT

04:05:07.692 --> 04:05:09.027
THEY SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE BUT

04:05:09.094 --> 04:05:10.195
AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THAT

04:05:10.262 --> 04:05:12.064
UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ALSO HAVE

04:05:12.130 --> 04:05:13.398
TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE EXPRESSING

04:05:13.465 --> 04:05:15.067
THEIR OPINIONS IT WITHOUT FEAR

04:05:15.133 --> 04:05:16.535
OF REPRISAL AND IT CAN'T JUST BE.

04:05:16.601 --> 04:05:17.769
FREE SPEECH FOR THE PEOPLE THAT

04:05:17.836 --> 04:05:19.037
WE AGREE WITH THAT HAS TO BE

04:05:19.104 --> 04:05:20.906
FREE SPEECH FOR ALL AND SO I'M

04:05:20.972 --> 04:05:22.707
VERY SURPRISED ESPECIALLY GIVEN.

04:05:22.774 --> 04:05:23.775
MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRST

04:05:23.842 --> 04:05:24.876
AMENDMENT IS THAT IT SQUARELY

04:05:24.943 --> 04:05:26.745
APPLIES TO NON CITIZENS THERE

04:05:26.812 --> 04:05:27.512
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH DISPUTE

04:05:27.579 --> 04:05:28.413
ABOUT THAT.

04:05:28.480 --> 04:05:29.681
IN IN THE CASE LAW AS I

04:05:29.748 --> 04:05:31.783
UNDERSTAND IT SO THE FACT THAT

04:05:31.850 --> 04:05:33.452
YOU'RE THAT THERE SOME HESITANCY

04:05:33.518 --> 04:05:35.887
HERE ABOUT -- YOU KNOW UP SAYING

04:05:35.954 --> 04:05:36.655

04:05:36.721 --> 04:05:38.090
FIRST AMENDMENT WHEN IT APPLIES

04:05:38.156 --> 04:05:39.424
TO UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS.

04:05:39.491 --> 04:05:40.859
THAT GIVES ME PAUSE BECAUSE IT

04:05:40.926 --> 04:05:42.194
SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT IS EXACTLY

04:05:42.260 --> 04:05:43.228
WHAT THE WHAT THE FIRST

04:05:43.295 --> 04:05:46.031
AMENDMENT IS MEANT TO PROTECT

04:05:46.098 --> 04:05:47.165
AGAINST WHICH IS THE GOVERNMENT.

04:05:47.232 --> 04:05:47.933
PICKING SPEECH THAT IT AGREES

04:05:47.999 --> 04:05:49.367
WITH AND NOT BEING WILLING TO

04:05:49.434 --> 04:05:50.035
SUPPORT SPEECH THAT HE DISAGREES

04:05:50.102 --> 04:05:52.104
WITH SO -- I I UNDERSTAND THAT

04:05:52.170 --> 04:05:52.871
IT IT HAS A SUPPORT

04:05:52.938 --> 04:05:54.372
RECOMMENDATION THAT THAT WEIGHS

04:05:54.439 --> 04:05:55.574
VERY HEAVILY FOR ME AND THINKING

04:05:55.640 --> 04:05:57.209
ABOUT THIS BILL BUT WE HAVE TO

04:05:57.275 --> 04:05:58.743
BE CLEAR WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS.

04:05:58.810 --> 04:06:00.145
THAT FREE SPEECH MEANS FREE

04:06:00.212 --> 04:06:01.413
