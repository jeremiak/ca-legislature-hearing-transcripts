MORLOCK WHO'S ALWAYS. ON TIME AND I APPRECIATE HIS TIME VALUES SO -- SOONER MORE OCTAVE YOU'RE READY WE'LL START WHICH ARE YOUR SP FOUR NINE SIX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I SWATCH. COLLEAGUES IN JANUARY. IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT A RECORD TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR SUSPECTED CASES. OF ELDER FINANCIAL ABUSE REPORTED TO THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT LAST YEAR. THIS IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AMOUNT FIVE YEARS EARLIER ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT DATA EXCUSE ME. THE GROWING ELDERLY POPULATION CALIFORNIA NEEDS AN ASSISTANT PROTECTING ITS SENIORS. BANKS ARE ALREADY MANDATED REPORTERS BROKER DEALERS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS SHOULD PARTICIPATE AS WELL. THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF SENATE BILL. FOR NINETY SIX FOR NINETY SIX IMPLEMENTS THE NORTH AMERICAN SECURITIES ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION'S RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED IN SOME FORM BY NINETEEN STATES. I APPRECIATE THE REVIEW OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. YEAH THIS IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. I BELIEVE WE DO SEEING NONE COMING FAR THAT WE HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION CENA NAINA -- YOU GET A TWEENER SEE GUESTS AND TO ENTER SORRY ALL RIGHT OKAY. YES YOU MAY. GOOD AFTERNOON TO INVEST IN COURT REPRESENTING THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY. AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ASSOCIATION ALSO KNOWN AS THE FLAT. WE HAVE A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL -- IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THANK SENATOR MORE LIKE HIS STAFF AND YOUR AND COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL. I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT ANYTHING THAT SENATOR MORE LIKE HE SAID I THINK WE JUST CAN SAY THAT WE AGREE -- THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY'S WILLINGLY COMING TO THE TABLE TO SAY YES WE WANT TO BE MANDATED REPORTERS. BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO -- SYSTEM HAS WORKED ON OVER TWENTY REPORT AND HOLD PROPOSALS WITH STATE LEGISLATORS -- FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS AND WE'RE BEING VERY PROACTIVE NOT REACTIVE. I LIKE TO TAKE TIME TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REGARDING OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. IT'S NOT OUR INTENT TO HOLD UP THE BILL OR CAUSE ANY TYPE OF OPPOSITION OUR INTENT IS ALWAYS BEEN TO INCREASE INVESTOR PROTECTION. AN EFFORT TO MOVE FORWARD -- BUT WITH ONE EXCEPTION WOULD LIKE TO WITHDRAW THEIR REQUEST FOR AMENDMENTS. THE ONE EXCEPTION IS VERY IMPORTANT THOUGH. ON PAGE TEN LINES SIX THROUGH. TWELVE IT DEALS WITH THE MANDATED REPORTERS NOTIFICATIONS VIA A TRUSTED CONTACT PERSON. THE COMMUTE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RIGHTLY POINTS OUT. THIS STANDARD IS THAT THIS IS A STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY. WHICH IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE RULES OF THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SPINNERETS. WELL THIS IS TRUE. AS DRAFTED SENATE BILL FOR NINETY SIX ONLY ADDRESSES REACHING OUT FOR FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION. IT MAY BE INTERPRETED AS LIMITING THE OTHER INSTANCES IN WHICH IS A FAVORITE TRUSTED CONTACT CAN BE USED. OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD ALSO CLEAR FIGHT THAT WE CAN COMPLY WITH SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS UNDER GRAMM LEACH BLILEY AND THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATIONS. I'M SURE THIS IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE SENATOR IT DOES NEED TO BE CLARIFIED. MY HOPE AND AND I HOPE I THINK WE WILL GET THERE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THE BILL -- AND WITH THAT I THINK. YOU ANY OTHER TRAINERS THERE. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IS THERE ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR CAFIERO. I DO HAVE A QUESTION I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT AREA -- AS WE HAVE A AGING POPULATION WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE OVERSIGHT TO HELP -- TO MANAGE. THEIR MONEY IN A WAY AND TO HAVE MANDATORY REPORTERS I THINK IS REALLY GREAT THE CONCERN I HAD WAS -- WAS IN IN IN TERMS OF A BOMB. AND AND THE REPORT THE REPORT BEING MADE ON THAT THERE THERE MAY BE AN IRREGULARITY AND SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR MAYBE ABUSE -- GOING ON THAT THE ELDER THE DEPENDED DON'T MAY NOT HAVE ANY RCOURSE AFTER DELAYED THE TRANSACTION IS MADE THEY WOULD HAVE TO LET THE PROCESS. PLAY ITSELF OUT WHICH MEANS IT THEY MAY HAVE TO WAIT FIFTEEN DAYS AND I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT -- AT SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS NO ABUSE AND THE AND THE INDIVIDUAL IS IS GOT. SOMETHING THEY'RE GOING TO USE THE MONEY FOR AN CAN CAN USE AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD -- IT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE -- AND DETERMINATION BY THE MANDATED REPORTED THAT THE TRANSACTION. WILL NOT RESULT IN FINANCIAL ABUSE MAY TAKE THE THAT FIFTEEN DAYS AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MEANTIME. IS THERE ANY WAY TO KIND OF OVERCOME THAT -- POSITIVELY BY THE THE ELDER THAT'S BEING -- REPORTED ON OR THE MONEY THEIR MONEY'S BEING REPORTED ON THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION CENTER CAN BE OUR OWN I DON'T HAVE A PRECISE ANSWER OTHER THAN -- IN CERTAIN INSTANCES -- ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE -- RECOGNIZED. ADULT CHILDREN THAT ARE A PARTICIPATING YOU THROUGH A PART OF ATTORNEY -- CONSERVATORSHIP OR SOME OTHER FORM OF GUARDIANSHIP -- AND IN IDEA BUT I I WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD CONTACT THEM. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRANSACTION IS IS LEGITIMATE. OR TRYING TO PREVENT. INSTANCES WERE EARLY SIGNS OF DEMENTIA THEY START. DOING ALL CANCER UNIQUE THINGS AND AND SO -- WE WILL THE THE THE PUSH BACK WE'VE GOTTEN IS THAT MAYBE FIFTEEN DAYS IS TOO SHORT. SO -- BUT I CAN GET BACK TO ON A MORE PRECISE ANTHROPOLOGY YOU KNOW IT AND THAT IT'S FINE I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF RAISE IT IS A RED FLAG. HAVING GONE THROUGH THIS -- THIS EXACT SCENARIO THAT YOU TALK ABOUT WHERE ON OF THE THE INDIVIDUAL MY MY FATHER WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF FINE THE FINANCES -- STARTED MAKING DECISIONS IT DIDN'T LOOK IN THE BEST INTERESTS WE WERE ABLE TO CATCH THAT -- AS WE WERE LOOKING THROUGH THE BANK. STATEMENTS. AND BUT BUT IS AB. THERE MAY NOT BE SOME ADULT CHILDREN THAT ARE THAT ARE WATCHING AND THERE MAY NOT BE. THAT KIND OF OVERSIGHT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING THE RIGHT AWAY FROM THE THE ELDERLY INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES AND AND AND AND SO MAYBE. AN ADVISEMENT WITH THE BACKSTOP OF OF OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS COMING IN YOU CAN YOU CAN NARROW THE TIME I JUST IT'S A SINCE I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING IN HERE. I JUST THOUGHT WE MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT -- WE ENDED UP IN SOME VERY ODD INSTANCES. WHERE WE COULDN'T LOOK AT THINGS -- EXPEDITIOUSLY BECAUSE I HAD A ONCE MY FATHER PASSED I HAD TO TAKE MY MOTHER DOWN WHO HAS ALZHEIMER'S. AND STAND IN LINE FOR HOURS TO GET THINGS DONE AT THE BANK AND IT WAS THE MOST RIDICULOUS SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN THOUGH I HAD THE POWER OF ATTORNEY I HAD THE TRUST. DOCUMENTS ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. IF WE PUT TOO MANY OBSTACLES ON THE BANKS AND IN THE END THEIR ATTORNEYS WILL SAY NO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET A COURT ORDER WHICH I WAS NOT WILLING. TO TO WHEN I HAD ALL THE PAPERWORK SO I I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THIS KIND OF THING AND I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IF I IF I MAY. UM. DURING THAT TIME THERE IS AN OF ITS INVESTIGATION GOING ON AND WHAT BY THIS BILLS ALSO SUPPORT BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT. WHO CAN BE CONTACTED?

OUR CALENDARS HOW IT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS TO BE ADDED ON IT NEXT WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER THREE SB FOUR SEVEN TWO BY SENATOR CAPPIELLO WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRINT PRESENT SB. FOUR SEVENTY TWO WHICH PROVIDES STATUTORY CLARITY FOR REGULATING EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS. EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS ALLOW CONSUMERS TO ACCESS A PORTION OF THE WAGES THEY HAVE ALREADY EARNED PRIOR TO THEIR SCHEDULED PAYDAY -- IS HOW A SIMPLE PROGRAM WORKS A CONSUMER REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO HIS OR HER MONEY. USING AN APP THE CONSUMER CAN QUICKLY ACCESS UP TO HALF OF THE AMOUNT OF HIS OR HER EARNED UNPAID INCOME DURING A GIVEN PAY PERIOD. FOR THE ENTIRE PAY PERIOD OR FOR A SINGLE FIXED FEE. THIS IS THIS BE IS A NONRECURRING FEE AND ONLY PAID IF AND WHEN A CONSUMER CHOOSES TO USE THE PROGRAM. AND THE FEE IS LESS THAN A TYPICAL BANK OVERDRAFT FEE FOR A LATE FEE. WITH THE FOR A FEW SCREEN TAP USERS CAN HAVE INSTANT ACCESS TO THEIR ALREADY EARNED UNPAID WAGES. WHETHER IT'S TO COVER AN UNEXPECTED COST FOR JUST AVOID A LATE OR OVERDRAFT FEE SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST NEED A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY. IN FACT 70% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK EVEN PEOPLE OF MEANS AND THESE FINANCE CHARGES INTEREST PAYMENTS CHECK CASHING FEES LATE FEES ON MONTHLY BILLS AND OTHER EXPENSES. CAN OFTEN RAN AS MUCH AS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY THIS FINANCIAL TAX IS A HIGHLY REGRESSIVE TAX IMPOSED ON THOSE WHO ARE OFTEN OFTEN LEAST ABLE TO PAY. BY CREATING A STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS WE CAN PROVIDE A SAFE WAY FOR CUSTOMERS TO GET THEIR MONEY WHEN THEY NEED IT. IT IS A TOOL FOR PEOPLE TO USE THAT COMES WITH GUARDRAILS PROTECTIONS AND FLEXIBILITY. THE PROTECTIONS IN SB FOUR SEVENTY TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE HELD HARMLESS AND SINCE IT'S NOT ALONE THEY CAN'T DEFAULT. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH CONSUMER GROUPS AND LOOK FOR FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSIONS ON HOW TO BUILD SOLID PARAMETERS AROUND THESE EARNED INCOME ACCESS PROGRAMS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS DAN QUAN WHO MOSTRI RECENTLY SERVED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS SENIOR ADVISER. TO DIRECTOR RICHARD CORDRAY AT THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU MY COMP ID. CARPENTER ON BEHALF OF ACTIVE AND YOU JUDGE ON MORE ACTIVE CEO WHO CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAM WOULD WORK. HAS BEEN MOVING IN ON ALL THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO TESTIFY SHOWN IN WHAT ORDER JERSEY. SCORE YOU GOING FOR SURE MISTER CHAIRMAN MY CARPENTER ON BEHALF OF THE ACTIVE. MORE VERY ENTHUSED TO SPONSOR THE BILL VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE THE THE DEMONSTRATE THE BENEFITS OF EARNED WAGE ACCESS PROGRAMS TO CONSUMERS. EARN WAGES ACCESS IS A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE CONSUMER DRIVEN INNOVATIVE NEW PROGRAM THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS WORKERS TO ACCESS A PORTION OF THE WAGES. THEY'VE ALREADY EARNED. I ALSO WANTED TO THANK. THE AUTHOR THE AUTHOR STAFF OF THE VERY DILIGENT -- COMMITTEE CONSULTANT WHO'S WORKED ON THIS AS WELL AS THE CONSUMER AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS WHO WE'VE -- NOT REACHING OUT TO AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A VERY STRONG STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR THESE PROGRAMS. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE AS THE ANALYSIS DOES A NICE JOB OF POINTING OUT. EARNED WAGE ACCESS PROGRAMS DON'T FIT INTO ANY CURRENT REGULATORY CONSTRUCT -- OUR CLIENT MET WITH ACT WAS MET WITH THE D. BO AND THEY URGED US TO COME TO YOU THE LEGISLATURE FOR SOME STATUTORY. CLARITY AND WE THINK THIS LEGISLATION DOES JUST THAT. IT ESTABLISHES THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK -- THAT THAT WERE SEEKING. IT -- PROVIDES STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IT IMPOSES A CONSUMER FRIENDLY AND MEANINGFUL REQUIREMENTS ON PROVIDERS OF EARNED WAGE ACCESS. SO THAT THESE PROGRAMS CAN REMAIN A FLOURISHING OPTION FOR CONSUMERS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT KERN WAGE ACCESS PROVIDES A FOR FAR LESS EXPENSIVE AND RISKY OPTION FOR CONSUMERS WHO WANT TO BETTER MANAGE THEIR CASH FLOW. AND THEIR FINANCES AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD -- ASK OUR OUR EXPERT MISTER QUAN. TAKE IT FROM HERE. REMEMBER FOR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. SUPPORT OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK CENTER CUBBY ORAL FOR COMMITMENT AGAIN. TO CONSUMERS BY INTRODUCING SB. FOUR SEVENTY TWO THIS LEGISLATION PROVIDES A NEED IT. AND OVERDUE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE NEW FUNDING FOR SERVICE OF WHICH ACCESS PROGRAMS. BY CREATING STRONG CLEAR CUSTOMER PROTECTIONS AND IMPOSES CONSUMER FRIENDLY REQUIREMENTS I'M PROVIDERS OF WHICH ACCESS PROGRAMS. TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS CAN ENJOY THE TREMENDOUS BENEFITS OF THIS INNOVATIVE AFFORDABLE SAFE ALTERNATIVE. MY NAME IS DAN CALL I'M CURRENTLY A CONSULTANT TO DESTRUCTIVE EARLY STAGE COMPANIES INCLUDING PAY ACTIVE. FOR COME TO THIS BECAUSE I MOST RECENTLY SERVED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AS SENIOR ADVISER TO DIRECTOR RICHARD CORDRAY OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU CFPB. IN THAT CAPACITY. I LET THE CITY'S A THINK TANK OFFICE WHOSE MISSION WAS TO PROMOTE CONSUMER FROM THE INNOVATION. WHEN I ASSUME THE LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE OFFICE IN? TWENTY THIRTEEN I LASER FOCUSED ALL IDENTIFYING AND FACILITATING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS BUT CAN DISRUPT SHORT TERM HI CALLS CREDIT PRODUCTS SUCH AS PRETTY LOANS AND THE BANK OVERDRAFTS -- WAGE ACCESS OR D. W. A IS IT DESTRUCTIVE MODEL THE HELP CONSUMERS ESPECIALLY LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CONSUMERS OR THE MOST FINANCIALLY FRAGILE. AND THE MOST PROBLEM TOOL FOR VICTIMS TO PREDATORY AND ABUSE OF LENDING. THESE CONSUMERS NEED BETTER OPTIONS EW ES SIMPLY PROVIDES CONSUMERS WITH ACCESS TO PART OF THEIR OWN ALREADY EARNED THE MONEY AT A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST THE OTHER OPTIONS. AND DOESN'T CREATE A THE IN HERE IN THE RISKS POSED BY A LOAN OR DEBIT. OR DEBT OBLIGATION. ANY OF THE CITY BE WERE INITIALLY VERY SKEPTICAL OF THE EASE UP A ONES. THINKING THEY MIGHT BE NO DIFFERENT THAN OTHER EXPENSE. SHORT TERM LENDING -- PRODUCTS. HOWEVER AFTER A VERY THOUGHTFUL AND THE CRITICAL EXAMINATION. THE DEDICATED STAFF AT THE CITY BE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU DON'T REALLY PROGRAMS PROVIDE A SAFE AND A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE TO SHORT TERM LOANS FOR CONSUMERS AND THEREFORE. THEY WERE TRYING THEIR BEST TO ENCOURAGE THEM AS A RESULT THE FINAL A BOMB ON INSPIRATION PAY THE RLE RELEASED BY THE CFPB IN LATE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN CREATED A SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS OR RECALL SAFE HARBORS. TO ACCOMMODATE RESPONSIBLE EW ES MODELS IN ORDER TO PROMOTE CONSUMER ACCESS TO THEM. THOSE EXEMPTIONS REQUIRE EW ES PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE MEANINGFUL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ARE REELS IF YOU WELL. SURE THE PROGRAM IS NOT PREDATORY. I HAVE ALSO WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH COMMITTEE STAFF TO ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUE AND SENATOR CABALLERO HAS INTRODUCED. AS INCORPORATED ALL THOSE MOST GHARIALS IN HER BILL. ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE PAY THE RULE IS NOW BEING RESCINDED AS YOU KNOW BY THE CURRENT THE CFPB DEALERSHIP. I WILL POINT OUT THAT THE EW ES EXEMPTIONS AT PRESENT TIME STILL REMAIN UNCHANGED. THIS SHOWS THERE'S BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. FOR THE CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESPONSIBLE EW ES ALTERNATIVES FOR CONSUMERS. THERE WERE A FEW FIRMS OFFERING EW ES WHEN I FIRST LOOKING TO THIS -- SPACE MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AGO. NOW IT HAS BECOME A BURGEONING MARKET WAS VARIOUS BUSINESS MODELS. AS EW ES GAINS TRACTION MANY THE GYM IN THE PUBLIC POLICY QUESTIONS ARE BEING RAISED. AND THE LACK OF REGULATION CALIFORNIA INVITES ON SAVORY PRACTICES. DURING MY TENURE AT THE CFPB I OVERSAW THE DELIBERATION OF MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE POLICY QUESTIONS THIS COMMITTEE MAY BE WRESTLING WITH. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY VIEWS TODAY. THESE VIEWS ARE WHAT ARE OF MY OWN THEY DO NOT REFLECT THOSE OF MY FORMER AGENCY. FIRST QUESTION IS. IS IT UP TO A CREDIT. WHETHER OR NOT YOU W. IS CONSIDERED CREDIT IS IMPORTANT A QUESTION DETERMINING HOW YOU W. A. SHOULD BE PROPERLY REGULATED. AND IN SHORT IN MY OPINION YOU DON'T DO IS NOT CREDIT. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF EW ISN'T IT REALLY REALLY VERY SIMPLE. ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS HIS OR HER OWN A CREW WAGES. A PORTION OF THE MONEY THEY HAVE ALREADY EARNS ON DEMAND AND THE WITHOUT CREATING A DEBT OBLIGATION. THE BILL IS BASED ON THE CREW WAGES THAT ARE YET TO BE PAID. IF NO WAGES AREN'T NO ACCESS IS GRANTED. NO FUTURE WAGES AND TO THE SPECULATIVE RISK ASSOCIATED WAS TAPPING INTO THEM ARE IMPICATED. THINGS THAT CONSUMERS PAY A FIXED ONE TIME NONRECURRING FEE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS PHONES BASED UPON OR CALCULATE THE PONG A PORTION OF THE OUR CREW INCOME. THERE IS NO DEBTS THERE'S NO INTEREST CHARGE THERE'S NO COLLATERAL OR SECURITY INTERESTS TAKEN FROM THE EMPLOYEE CONSUMER HOLDING PLAYER. AFTER CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZING EITHER UPDATE FOR ONE THE CFPB DECISION TO EXEMPT YOU W. A. FROM THE ABILITY TO REPAY REQUIREMENTS. IN THE FINAL PAY THE RULE. SEND A VERY STRONG AND CLEAR MESSAGE THAT THE EW ES IS NOT CREDIT. THE SECOND QUESTION IS REALLY ABOUT. DOES EITHER BE A PROVIDE A LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE. WHILE I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT MARKET FORCES REALLY IN ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THE PRICES AS AS PROVIDERS COMPETE. I UNDERSTAND WHY STATES MY WANTING STILL A PRICE CAP. THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THAT. IN NO EVENT UNDER THIS BILL. MAY THE TOTAL FEE CHARGED TO A CONSUMER IN A SINGLE MONTH. EXCEEDS A STRICT CAP OF FOURTEEN DOLLARS. SO THIS ESSENTIALLY TRANSLATES TO A MAXIMUM OF SEVEN DOLLARS PER BI WEEKLY OR BI MONTHLY PAY PERIODS. AND THE THREE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR WEEKLY PAY PERIOD. HOLIDAY BECAUSE O THE BETTER TECHNOLOGIES AND TO THE VERY NATURE OF THE EE THESE PROGRAMS AT THE PRESENT TIME ARE FAR LESS EXPENSIVE IN A FEW CAP UNDER THE BILL. AND THE FAR LESS EXPENSIVE THAN PAYDAY LOANS LATE FEES OVERDRAFT FEES. I BELIEVE THE PRICE CAP PUT IN THIS PLACE PUTTING PLACING SPELL IS VERY REASONABLE AND CAL WORK FOR MOST EW ES PROVIDERS. LET ME JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO TO SHARE WITH YOU -- A CASE STUDY FOR P. ACTIVE [inaudible] ALL [inaudible] FASTER. IN THE PICTURE PATTY WAS CASE THE CUSTOMER TO ACCESS UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. OF HIS ARM -- WAGE UP TO THREE TIMES PER PAY PERIOD. FOR SINGLE FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS THIS COMPARES TO A TYPICAL FORTY FIVE DOLLAR CHARGE FOR A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS HAD A LONG. SO AS YOU CAN SEE. THE PRICE POINTS THERE'S NO COMPARISON. pFURTHER A GUARD RAILS TO AVOID THAT TRAPS IT ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO CHOOSE TO ACCESS EW ES UP TO THREE TIMES IN A PAY PERIOD. NOT TO EXCEED 50% OF THE CREW AGES. THE THIRD QUESTION IS IS REALLY ABOUT DOES IT UP THEY PROVIDE A LESS RISKY ALTERNATIVE. SO I WILL I WOULD ARGUE THE BILL IS FAR LESS RISKY AND IF YOU STRUCTURE WELL -- YOU CAN PROVIDE A MUCH BETTER AND SAFER ALTERNATIVE. AND THIS BILL REQUIRED TO GET UP A NOT TO HAVE RECORDS I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT I WANT TO MAKE HERE -- I AND I BELIEVE IN IN THE CURRENT -- AT PRESENT MOST OF THE W. PROGRAMS IN THE MARKET TODAY DON'T HAVE RECOURSE SO IF FULL IF FOR WHATEVER REASON OR FOR NO REASON AT ALL. THE CONSUMER DECIDES NOT TO REIMBURSABLE PROVIDER THE CONSUMER IS HELD COMPLETELY HARMLESS AS A PROVIDER HAS NO RECOURSE AGAINST CONSUMERS. THE WORST CASE THAT HAPPENS THE CONSUMER IS THE LAW ALSO FUTURE ACCESS WITHOUT DELAY. THE LAST POINT OUT TO MAKE A IS THIS BILL REQUIRES THE CONSUMERS NOT TO BE COMPELLED. TO ESTABLISH A ACCOUNTS WAS A PROVIDER AS A PRECONDITION TO RECEIVE IT ON THE THIS IF CARD THIS SAFEGUARD IT MIRRORS THE COMPULSORY USE CALL PROVISION UNDER REGULATION E. IS WHICH IS A FEDERAL REGULATION -- ENFORCED BY THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. THIS PROVISION BASICALLY ENSURES THAT CONSUMERS ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY A RULED PROVIDERS THEY OF THE HANDS OFFER OF ACTING EXPENSE EITHER OBVIOUSLY WHILE CHARGING CARD FEES OR OTHER PRODUCTS. LAST DAY. ALTHOUGH THE NATURE IN THE TERMS OF THE W. PROGRAMS ARE FAR SIMPLER AND EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE FROM FOR CONSUMERS WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER CREDIT TRANSACTIONS. AS WITH ANY FINANCIAL PRODUCT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB EDUCATING CONSUMERS ON HOW TO RESPONSIBLY USE IT ON THE WAY. MANY PROVIDERS TODAY ALREADY OFFER FINANCIAL WELLNESS PROGRAMS INCLUDING MAKING FINANCIAL LITERACY AND THE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION TO FIND OF A COUNSELING FOR EXAMPLE P. ACTIVE OFFERS BUDGETING AND THE SAVINGS TOOLS. THESE BENEFITS THESE BENEFITS ARE WELL COVERED IN THE FIVE DOLLAR FEE AND COME AT NO ADDITIONAL COST TO THE CONSUMER. FINALLY THIS BILL PROVIDES A VERY POWERFUL IN FORCING THE MECHANISM AS IT CONTAINS A PRIVATE Y. ACTION TO ENSURE THAT YOU W. PROVIDERS OF HERE TO THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND COMPLY WAS REQUIRES SAFEGUARDS. I WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. YOU. TOO HAVE TESTIMONY AS WELL I DON'T LIKE THIS IT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU -- ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SIGNATURE BRADFORD MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WE JUST WANTED TO CONVEY OUR SUPPORT FOR THE CONCEPT IN THE PROGRAM. FROM WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT IT IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS VERY MUCH AND MORE RESPONSIBLE LESS RISKY ALTERNATIVE TO PAYDAY LENDING BUT REALLY SHE'S EXTREMELY COMPLICATED SO WE'RE JUST. CONTINUING TO ANALYZE THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THERE AREN'T ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OR ANYTHING BUT JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR THE CONCEPT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU DISCOVERED LOWER THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE WE ALSO DON'T HAVE A SUPPORT POSITION OR ANY POSITION -- BUT JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE THE SPONSORS AND THE AUTHORS HAVE REACHED OUT VERY EARLY ON AND OFFERED TO WORK WITH US AND WE'RE EAGERLY ANALYZING THE BILL THIS IS A NEW AREA OF LAW. SO -- AND AND THE ATTORNEYS -- NATIONALLY ARE PRETTY BUSY WITH THE ATTACKS ON CONSUMER RIGHTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CATCH UP -- BUT BUT DO BELIEVE THAT HAVING -- SOME PARAMETERS ON THIS TYPE OF SERVICE -- WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL AND ESPECIALLY IF IT CAN ENCOURAGE CONSUMER EDUCATION WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT TOO THANK YOU THANK YOU. TURN MEMBER SUSAN MARTIN DOUBLE CONSUMER PRESS ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD TODAY WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A FORMAL POSITION WE'RE ALSO WORKING THROUGH. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS CLARITY AND PROTECTIONS FOR THESE KINDS OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS BUT REALLY PREFER THE DIALOGUE WILL CONTINUE. THANK YOU.

GREAT ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. TEEN HEARING NINE ONTO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR ALSO. YES THANK YOU SENATOR COLORADO FOR OF PRESENTING THIS BILL -- IT SURE. FEELS BETTER THAN STARTING AT THE TOP WITH. CALGENE OF POOR PEOPLE WHEN THEY NEED -- YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY TO GET THROUGH. IT'S MUCH EASIER I THINK TO DEAL WITH THAT THEN STUDY WHERE. YOU KNOW THE INTEREST IS THREE OR 4100% -- SO I REALLY APPRECIATE -- YOU BRING THIS FORWARD IN THIS WAY. I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT -- YOU DOING IN ADVANCE BEFORE SO. THE MARKET GETS SO. IN CHILE SO BIG THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK AND REDO WHAT HAS YOU KNOW BECOMES THE PRACTICE SO. DOING IN ADVANCE I THINK IS GREAT -- I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE US SENATOR THAT. YOU INTEND TO KEEP MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND CONSUMER GROUPS AND THAT'S ANOTHER BIG PLUS I UNDERSTAND THEY BROUGHT THAT. HAVE RESULT HERE TODAY SO THE FACT THAT YOU BROUGHT IT UP EARLY IT IS ALSO SOMETHING GOOD I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION IS -- IN ALL OF THIS CAN YOU REMIND ME. WHAT'S THE MAX OR IS THERE A MAX AMOUNT OF MONEY. FROM THAT COULD BE. BORROWED I KNOW IT'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT RELATED TO WAGES BUT REMIND ME AGAIN WHAT THAT IS. YES IT'S 50% OF THE EARNED. WAGES WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN EARNED WHAT ALREADY BEEN AREN'T THAT'S CORRECT OKAY SO IT'S NOT A DOLLAR AMOUNT NO IT PERCENT INJECTED BASED ON WHAT THEY WHAT THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. GOD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- AS STATED -- THIS IS A NEW.

WHY WE NEED THIS BILL? THANK YOU SENATOR MISTER CHAIRMAN JOINT COMMITTEE CALIFORNIA'S BACK CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE -- YOU KNOW WHAT WE SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE IT PROVIDES ACCESS TO CAPITAL. AND AND PROVIDE FOR SOME NEEDED -- CONSUMER -- PROTECTIONS -- ADDITIONALLY -- BY IMPLEMENTING -- CLEAR CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS INCLUDING STRENGTHENING THE BILL YOU TO REPAY STANDARDS. TO ENSURE CONSUMERS PAY BACK. PAY BACK THEIR LOANS NEW REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE CONSUMERS ARE INFORMED ABOUT LOW COST POWERING OPTIONS IN ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO PAY BACK THEIR LOANS. EARLY OR RESCHEDULE THEIR LOAN PAYMENTS. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE LENDERS TO OPERATE. IN THE STATE IN CALIFORNIA DO SO TRANSPARENTLY AND IN A WAY THAT HELPS BOWERS GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. I'M. WE ALSO FEEL THAT -- WHEN COMPANIES ARE TRANSPARENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GIVEN PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERING? AND STATE LICENSE NON -- PRIME LETTERS ABOUT ABIDE BY STRICT RULES ON THIS FRONT THE CONSUMERS SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE THE PRODUCT. THAT IS RIGHT FOR THEM SO AGAIN THIS IS. WHAT WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS ACCESS TO CAPITAL -- AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESS TO BEGIN AND CONSUMERS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE IN AND BE ABLE TO TRUST A MAN. AND WE PAY BACK THOSE LOANS SLOW THANK YOU. AND TO SHOW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MR MEMBERS AS ARE THE OTHER BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL WE DO HAVE -- LATE LETTER OF SUPPORT AND WHEN I THANK THE AUTHOR TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES PARTICULAR IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IT'S CYCLICAL THERE'S A LOT OF BOOM AND BUST AND A LOT OFTENTIMES WHEN IT'S AN EMERGENCY. OUR MEMBERS ARE ALREADY LIVING PAYCHECK TO CHECK PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND SO SOMETIMES THESE PRODUCTS ARE WHERE THE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE EMERGENCY ISSUES THAT THEY MAY. BE EXPERIENCING SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. AN ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SHE KNOWN WHAT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME [inaudible] FOR SEE HERE [inaudible] TWO SIX A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS GONNA SEE A LOT BONTA DHEAS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA POLICY FOR THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING HERE IN OPPOSITION. SEVERAL IS A NONPROFIT RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROTECTING HOMEOWNERSHIP IN FAMILY WEALTH BY FIGHTING PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES OUR SISTER ORGANIZATION THE SELF HELP FEDERAL CREDIT UNION WE HAVE NINETEEN BRANCHES AROSS THE STATE. INCLUDING THE FARM WORKER CREDIT UNION THAT WAS STARTED BY MISTER LET US WORK ON SAYS ARE CHAVEZ OUR CREDIT UNION PROVIDES SMALL DOLLAR LOANS -- FOR DOCTOR LOANS CREDIT BUILDER LOANS MORTGAGES FOR BORROWERS WITH UNTRADITIONAL CREDIT. US THROUGH OUR RESEARCH AND OUR DIRECT SERVICES WHERE WELL CONNECTED TO THE ISSUES ON THE GROUND WE HEAR FIRSTHAND FROM FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SITUATION IS DIRE BECAUSE LENDERS CURRENTLY HAVE THE GREEN LIGHT TO AGGRESSIVELY MARKET LOANS WITH UNLIMITED INTEREST RATES TO CONSUMERS WE'RE SEEING FAMILIES TRAPPED IN LOANS THAT KERRY APR AS OF MORE THAN A 100%. ONE OUT OF THREE BORROWERS WITH HIGH COST LOANS END UP IN THE FALL THEY'RE OFTEN SUIT FOR WAGE GARNISHMENT AND MANY END UP IN BANKRUPTCY. LAST YEAR MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND BORROWERS WITH CAR TITLE LOANS HAD THEIR CARS REPOSSESSED. A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN THAT BALLOONS INTO 400-004-0000 DOLLARS IN SEVEN YEARS SHOULD BE E. LEGAL. IN FACT HELLO MIKE THIS IS ILLEGAL IN THIRTY SEVEN STATES BECAUSE OF STATE INTEREST RATE CAPS OF 36% OR LESS -- DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CONGRESS PASSED THE MILITARY LENDING ACT THAT PROHIBITS LOANS OF MORE THAN 36% FOR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY. CALIFORNIA'S BEHIND AN SB FOUR EIGHTY TWO DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. SB FORTY TWO WOULD ALLOW PREDATORY LENDERS TO DO BUSINESS AS USUAL SPECIFICALLY THE UNDERWRITING STANDARDS ARE WEAK AND DO NOT ENSURE THAT BORROWERS ARE PROTECTED FROM ON AFFORDABLE LOANS. SB FORTY TWO DOES NOT PREVENT A LENDER FOR MAKING A LOAN EAT WHICH EQUALED OR EVEN EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT OF A BORROWER'S AVAILABLE INCOME IN A GIVEN REPAYMENT PERIOD -- IN ADDITION SB FORTY TWO DOES NOT PROHIBIT A LENDER FROM EXTENDING A LOAN OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIFTEEN YEARS WHILE THIS MAY BRING DOWN A MONTHLY PAYMENT IT WILL COST THOUSANDS MORE IN INTEREST IN FACT PREDATORY LENDERS ARE DOING THAT THIS NOW. SB FORTY TWO WOULD DIRECT LENDERS TO DISCLOSE TO CONSUMERS THE FACT THAT THESE ARE HIGH COST LOANS BUT THE UTILITY OF SUCH DISCLOSURES IS UNCERTAIN AT BEST WE'VE HEARD FIRST HAND FROM BORROWERS HAVE NOT GOTTEN DISCLOSURES -- IN BEFORE THE FUNDS WERE DISPERSED INTO THEIR BANK ACCOUNT WHICH IS ILLEGAL. WE'VE HEARD THAT THEY HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE LEAD -- DOCUMENTS IN THEIR LANGUAGE WHICH IS ALSO. THAT'S A REQUIREMENT BY CALIFORNIA LAW -- DISCLOSURE IN TEN POINTFONT IS NOT ENOUGH WHAT WE NEED IS AN INTEREST RATE CAPS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY OPPOSE. TURN MEMBERS IN MARTIN TELL US IN YOUR POLICY COUNCIL WITH CONSUMER REPORTS FORMALLY CONSUMERS UNION I'M ALSO IN OPPOSITION YOU SURE THE PERSPECTIVE OF MY COLLEAGUE -- YOU KNOW THE THE LEGISLATURE IS RAP IS GRAPPLING WITH WHAT TO DO. ABOUT -- A HETEROGENEOUS CONSUMER LENDING MARKET WHERE MANY ACTORS ARE [inaudible] TRANSPONDERS SAYING -- BUT ONE SEGMENT CONTINUES TO CHARGE INCREDIBLY HIGH INTEREST IT'S THAT TIME AGAIN. HAVE TO HAVE SHOWN TO PUT PEOPLE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE THEY BEGAN. AND IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS RECOGNIZED THAT AND LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ISSUED A RULING -- IN THE CASH CALL WE DON'T DILATORY CASE AND SAID COURTS CAN FIND THAT IN THE LOAN WITH INTEREST RATES ABOVE 90% I'M COULD BE UNCONSCIONABLE AND THEREFORE VOID AS A MATTER OF CONTRACT LAW. THAT'S THE COURT OPENING THE DOOR FOR POTENTIAL INCREASED LITIGATION OFFER JUDGE MADE LAW AS TO WHAT'S A FAIR PRICE THE LOOK IT DOES SO IN OUR VIEW THE COURT HAS RAISED A QUESTION AND THE LEGISLATURE MUST ANSWER IT. WHAT IS A FAIR PRICE FOR A CONSUMER INSTALLMENT LOAN ABOVE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA? WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE ISSUE THAT SQUARELY BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR AND THAT THAT IS THE ISSUE AND THE PRICING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND SO UNFORTUNATELY WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL. IS AN APPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO WHAT IS A VERY CLEAR VERY REAL SYSTEMIC PROBLEM THAT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH ANYONE I'M HERE IN THE BUILDING TO ADDRESS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MONEY ADDITION WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNOR BEHALF CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED. RESEARCHER REMEMBERS THE PASSED WITH CARTER WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CITY AND COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO ALSO OPPOSED THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED. TESTING OF OUR LOW WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. DANIEL KESSLER BECAUSE OUR BEHALF OF THE CALL CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION IN OPPOSITION. ONLY SAN LUIS ON BEHALF OF ANY THOSE US NATION'S LARGEST LATINO CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS STRONG OPPOSITION. CHRIS RESPONSE WHICH OF THE COLLEGE REMAINING RIGHTS IN STRONG OPPOSITION. COMING WITH THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN OPPOSITION. HI RYAN FLANAGAN ON BEHALF OF ONE MARK FINANCIAL SERVICES IN OPPOSITION. THE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES ANY COMMENT FROM OUR COMMITTEE SENATOR ALSO. SENATOR WAS. UP -- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS. THERE WAS -- REFERENCE TO OF A PILOT PROGRAM. THAT GOES UNTIL JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND IF I UNDERSTAND THIS RIGHT. THERE WAS THERE'S A GRAPH THERE I THINK IT'S A PAGE. FOUR OF THAT COMPARES THE PILOT PROGRAM WITH THIS BILL AND COMMENTS. AS TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PILOT PROGRAM AND THE BILL -- AND THERE ARE. THERE ARE TWO AREAS IN WHICH THE REQUIREMENTS ARE IDENTICAL SO IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. TO IMPROVE. OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO AREAS WERE SAYS A PILOT PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS ARE MORE. RIGOROUS WHICH I TAKE TO MEAN GOOD ON THE SIDE OF THE CONSUMER -- AND THEN THERE'S ONE WHERE IT SAYS IT'S BASICALLY AYE IDENTICAL TO THE PILOT PROGRAM SO. IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE -- THIS IS WORSE THAN THE OR OR NOT DOING ANY BETTER IN SOME CASES WORSE THAN. THE PILOT PROGRAM SO. WHY? WHY GO IN THAT DIRECTION RIGHT WELL WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE -- AND PROTECT THE CONSUMER WHY GO IN THAT DIRECTION INSTEAD OF STRENGTHENING THE PROTECTIONS AS AT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PILOT PROGRAM I JUST WANNA. MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT AMEND THE PILOT PROGRAM. THE PILOT PROGRAM IN THIS BILL ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS. THE COMPARISON WITH THE PILOT PROGRAM JUST SAYING WITHIN ONE SPECIFIC CAR PILOT PROGRAM THAT SET TO SUNSET. THERE THEY ARE THESE OTHER COMPARISONS. I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL IT CAN BE FAIR IN THE SENSE THAT THESE -- PROVISIONS ARE BEINGTESTED CURRENTLY UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM BUT THE PILOT PROGRAM IS A VERY DIFFERENT PROGRAM THAN THIS PROGRAM. THE PILOT PROGRAM DOES NOT. COVER ALL THE PEOPLE THAT. LENDING COVERS IN GENERAL. PILOT PROGRAMS VERY SPECIFIC SO I WANT TO KIND OF ADD. OF A 100% PEOPLE -- TO LOOKING FOR LOANS PILOT PROGRAM OWNS ONLY COVERS A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THAT. WE CAN START WITH A CONVENTIONAL BANK ABOUT CONVENTIONAL BANK GIVES LOANS TO ONLY IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS IF YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL. LESS THAN TH -- UP ABOUT 10% OF OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK FOR A LOAN FROM A BANK ACTUALLY GET THEM THAT'S ONLY PEOPLE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR LONG WE CAN GET IT. FOR A A FOR PEOPLE TO LESS THAN THAT. SO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR STATE OUR OWN BANKED. OR HAVE NO CREDIT OR HAVE A VERY VERY BAD CREDIT. AND AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS IN A IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE USE THAT. INTEREST RATE LIMITS IS THAT YOU BASICALLY MAKE AN ENTIRE -- A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR POPULATION THAT HAS NO ACCESS TO ANY KIND OF CREDIT. IF THEY HAVE VERY POOR CREDIT AND THEY ARE HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY OMITTED FROM. THE THE LENDING MARKET HOW DO YOU RE ESTABLISH CREDIT HOW DO YOU GET ACCESS TO CAPITAL IF YOU HAVE A STATE. THAT DOES NOT ALLOW THERE TO BE SOME KIND OF LENDER THAT ALLOWS THAT. SO FIRST SOME INDIVIDUALS THEIR pTHAT THESE INDIVIDUALS NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT. AND TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH INTEREST RATE CREDIT. FOR THAT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT DO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH INTEREST CREDIT A LOT OF THEM REPAY THOSE LOANS AND AND ARE GIVEN -- ARE ARE ARE ABLE TO REESTABLISH CREDIT. FOR THE ONES THAT ARE NOT. WHAT USED TO HAPPEN BEFORE IS PEOPLE WOULD GO TO THE BLACK MARKET FOR CREDIT? AND AND THEN WE'RE HERE STOCK AS LEGISLATORS. IN THE POSITION OF DECIDING. WHAT DO I PREFERRED THAT WE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE DEFAULTING ON THOSE ARE PEOPLE THEY'RE GETTING THEIR KNEES BROKEN BECAUSE THEY THEY? ARE NOT PAYING THEM. AND AND THOSE ARE REAL SITUATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN -- THAT HAVE EXISTED IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE BLACK MARKET FOR LOANS. OUT OF DESPERATION AND WHAT WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO TO RESPOND TO THAT. WE CAN WE CAN WHAT WITHOUT CUTTING ACCESS TO TO LOANS YEAH WE NEED TO EDUCATE. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHICH THIS BILL DOES ABOUT ACCESSING HIGH INTEREST RATES WE HAVE TO CREATE ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS WHICH THE PILOT PROGRAMS BUT IT UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE PROGRAMS. DO NOT HELP THE PEOPLE. THAT ARE. GET ACCESS TO CREDIT SO HOW DO WE HELP THE PEOPLE THAT CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT OR DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PROGRAMS. THAT PROVIDE THEM CREDIT UNDER THIRTY SIX OR UNDER FORTY UNDER FIFTY OR UNDER 30% OR UNDER 20%. HOW DO WE HELP THEM? AND AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE HELP THEM BY ELIMINATING ALL SOURCES TO CREDIT. BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO I MEAN I'M I'M I'M TRYING TO CREATE A BUILT. THAT CREATES A STATE BANK I'M TRYING -- TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL LITERACY I'M TRYING -- TO FIND WAYS TO HELP I HAVE A A BILL THAT ALSO HELPS PEOPLE WHEN THEY OF WHEN THEY ARE PAY THE RENT. IF THE RENT PAY THE RENT ON THE CHIMNEY BASIS HELP SOME ESTABLISH CREDIT. THEY'RE ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP PEOPLE TO STAFF LEVELS SELFLESS CREDIT IF YOU GET A IF YOU GO TO A HOSPITAL. AND THERE'S A BILL FOR FOR THIRTY FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU CAN'T PAY IT RUINS YOUR CREDIT. I THINK THAT IN THIS STATE WE CANNOT. HELP PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACCESS BUT THAT WERE MAKING. MORE PEOPLE OUT OF PEOPLE THAT. COME ACROSS SOME FINANCIAL OF A OF SOME HEALTH PROBLEM AND WE'RE STILL NOT LEGISLATING THAT. IN ITS ITS BUT WHAT WE KNOW WHEN I'M TALKING TO PEOPLE TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THEY SAY. AMONG PEOPLE THEY'RE SEEKING LOANS ARE PEOPLE THAT CANNOT PAY THEIR THEIR THE BILL. AT A HOSPITAL. AND AND THOSE ARE PROBLEMS WE pLEGISLATURE UNTIL WE DO THAT IN MANY CASES. SOME OF THESE LOANS AND YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN THERE I'VE I'VE I'VE I'VE. I'VE HAD TO YOU KNOW PURSUE. LOANS OUTSIDE OF THE CONVENTIONAL MARKET BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T AVAILABLE. A TO ME AND BACK THEN WHEN I WAS MUCH YOUNGER AND LOOKING -- TO YOU KNOW START MY BUSINESS AND FOR MANY PEOPLE THAT WANT TO START THEIR BUSINESS AND AND KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THESE LINES OF CEDIT ARE ESSENTIAL EVEN IF THEY'RE HIGH INTEREST IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU CAN YOU CAN START A BUSINESS AND YOU CAN HAVE SUCCESS AND DO ALL PEOPLE FALL IN THAT CATEGORY NO BUT I DON'T WANT. TO FINISH THE PEOPLE. THAT CAN SUCCEED. BY TRYING TO SAVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ARE FALLING VICTIM TO THE SO WHAT WE CAN DO. WE CAN DO NOT I'M I'M SEEKING TO DO IS. LOOK. THERE ARE ALL THESE PROTECTIONS THAT WE CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH IN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THAT WILL. KEEP ACCESS TO CREDIT AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT STILL EDUCATE THEM AND LET HIM KNOW LOOK THIS OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE. IF FOR SOME REASON -- THEY THEY WERE THEY WERE OF MISLED OR NOT PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION THERE ARE MANY WAYS FOR US. TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND TO HELP THEM GET OUT OF THESE LOANS AND TO HELP THEM PROVIDE A ADVOCACY BECAUSE THAT ALSO COMES THROUGH -- THE VARIOUS GROUPS THAT WORK WITH WITH NON. WITH. ATTORNEYS THAT HELP PEOPLE IN BANKRUPTCY -- THEY KNOW THE LAWN AND AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN. HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT EVEN WHEN I TALK TO A BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEYS ASSN WHAT'S THE NUMBER ONE REASON THE PEOPLE GO INTO BANKRUPTCY [inaudible] MORTGAGE LOANS. AND THESE ARE LOW INTEREST RATE LOANS BUT FOR VERY HIGH AMOUNTS. AND THOSE ARE A BIGGER PROBLEM TO OUR SOCIETY THAN THESE HIGH INTERET RATE LOANS. OF IN TERMS OF BECAUSE IN BANKRUPTCY SO. IT MIGHT MIKE. MY BILL MAKES IT HARDER. FOR THESE LENDERS TO REPOSSESS VEHICLES IT GIVES. PEOPLE THAT WERE -- THAT MADE A DECISION OVER A MOMENTS -- YOU KNOW -- OTHER BY I MEAN HOW CAN ANY OF THESE GROUPS THAT ADVOCATE FOR CONSUMERS COME COME HERE TO THIS FORUM AND SAY I'M OPPOSED. TO A LIST OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE OPPOSED TO WHAT THE BILL DOESN'T DO. AND THAT'S LET LET'S I I I THINK HERE I THINK THE THE WHAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE IS A CAP ON INTEREST RATE LOS WE HAVE ANOTHER BILL THAT DOES THAT. AND AND THIS BILL DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH THAT. ONE AND SO DO YOU CAN APPROVE THIS BILL IF YOU LIKE THE OTHER BILL THAT PROPOSES A CAP YOU CAN YOU CAN GO FOR THAT ONE AS WELL BUT THESE ARE NOT. BILLS A CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER. BUT IT IS IT'S UP TO YOU FOR FOR MY TASTE. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP. PEOPLE THAT CAN ACCESS ACCESS TO CHEAPER CREDIT INCLUDING SUPPORTING PROGRAMS BUT LET'S BE HONEST. PROVIDING ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DO IT IT'S VERY RISKY. AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO IT IF IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING -- RISKY LOANS. TO A OF A CROSS SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY THAT CAN AFFORD TO REPAY THEM OR HAS A LIKELY THAT THEY WON'T REPAY THEM IS JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND IT'S A AND THAT THAT PROGRAM. WHAT DO YOU LIKE IT OR NOT? IT'S GOING TO DRY UP OF FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT. WHETHER THEY HAVE A ROOF ABILITY REPAIR OR OR PEPPER NOT IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE IT WILL NOT EXIST. AND FOR THE PEOPLE THAT IT DID IT IS CURRENTLY SERVING SUCCESSFULLY. THEY WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SO WHERE WILL THEY GO WHERE WE SEND THEM. WELL THANK THE COURT HAD CENTER -- I WAS JUSTASKING ABOUT THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO BUT SINCE YOU RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF YOU KNOW ONON LOANS -- THAT BOTHERS ME EVEN MORE THAT WORRIES ME EVEN MORE. I BEEN AROUND FOR COMMUNITIES AND WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES MY ENTIRE LIFE. AND THE THE PROBLEM I THINK HERE IF IF THIS IS. AS CONNECTED AS YOU EAT YOU SAID WHICH WAS NOT MY QUESTION. BUT YOU'RE SAYING THIS BASICALLY LEADS TO WE NEED COMPANIES. WHO CAN LOAN MONEY TO POOR PEOPLE AND IT ALMOST DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY CHARGE THEM? I DON'T THINK BECAUSE SOMEONE IS POOR. THAT A COMPANY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO GOUGE THEM AND CHARGE WHATEVER THEY WANT. WE WOULDN'T DO THAT IN A HOSPITAL SAID SOMEBODY GOES TO THE HOSPITAL WE WOULD NOT ALLOW. THAT HOSPITAL TO CHARGE. WHATEVER THAT WHATEVER WHATEVER THEY WHEN IT'S HAPPENING NOW. WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW WORST STOP WHEN WE HAVE SOME THINGS IN PLACE -- WE HAVE SOME THINGS IN PLACE HI BU YOU KNOW THE THE DOESN'T MEAN BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS POOR THE YOU GONNA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM. AND THAT'S WHAT'S TAKING PLACE IS COMPLETE ADVANTAGE OF POOR PEOPLE ALREADY POOR AND WE'RE GOING TO WORSEN THE CYCLE OF POVERTY SO I I GUESS I'M ONLY RESPONDING WITH THAT BECAUSE YOU YOU MADE A CASE FOR IT. I WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO SAY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BILL AND THE PILOT PROGRAM DIDN'T APPEAR TO HAVE. YOU KNOW OF ANYTHING THAT WAS BETTER -- AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS ASKING -- FOR AND LSO ARE THERE ANY CONSUMER GROUPS THAT. YOU'RE WORKINGWITH THAT YOURS THAT ARE WORKING WITH YOU TO SAY. WE NOT A FIX THIS IS A GOOD THING OR IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW I'M IF WE'RE IF IT'S A CONSUMER PROTECTION WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONSUMER GROUPS THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE AGAIN IT'S UP TO YOU TO DECIDE IF THIS IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION. CONSUMER PROTECTION. I THESE ARE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS I'VE. I'VE RECEIVED A 100%. OF WITH CONSUMER FEDS SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE THE THESE ARE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BUT AGAIN THE CONCERN AS WELL HE'S NOT ELIMINATE HE'S NOT CREATE A CAP. ON THE INTEREST RATE IN THIS BILL AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING AGAIN. IF WE SEPARATE THAT IS THIS A CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL ABSOLUTELY I MEAN. ANYBODY COULD SEE THAT THIS IS IMPOSING REQUIREMENTS TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER I'VE LISTED WHAT THEY ARE. AND THERE ARE WONDERFUL PROTECTIONS BUT AGAIN I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY LOOK. THEY THEY SHOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BECAUSE IT IS CONSUMER PROTECTION IT'S MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION DOES IT PROVIDED EVERYTHING THEY WANT TO SEE IT DOESN'T BECAUSE I I I AGAIN I BELIEVE. LOOK. I KNOW POOR PEOPLE. LOW INTEREST RATE LOANS. THIS IS NOT HAPPENING TO PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR AND I JUST WANT TO CREATE THE DISTINCTION THAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE CREDIT WHERE THEY HAVE VERY BAD CREDIT OR HAVE THEY HAVE A HISTORY. OF NOT PAYING BACK LOANS OR DEFAULTING ON LOANS FOR HAVE BANKRUPTCIES OR WHATEVER. THE THE THE THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY HAVE LIT LEAD THAT AS CREATE CRAZE SITUATION WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THANK YOU YOU CAN BE A RICH PERSON AND HAVE JUST COMPLETELY. HERBAL CREDIT AND AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET A LOAN I MEAN. OR HAVE BEEN A RICH PERSON. SO THERE'S A DISTINCTION I I HAVE. VERY LOW WAGE WORKERS THATOWN A HOME WITH A LOW INTEREST RATE IN MY DISTRICT AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS AND AGAIN. THEY'RE NOT THE ONES THAT ARE THAT NEED. A HIGHER INTEREST RATE LOANS BECAUSE THIS IS -- BUT THIS AGAIN GETS CHOOSE BERRIES US US. DEFINED SET OF LIEU OF OF LOANS THAT ARE OUT THERE IS GOING TO CREATE. NEW SAFEGUARDS IN A FEW SUPPORT THOSE NEW SAFEGUARDS ARE PROPOSING. IF YOU THINK THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH WELL. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T DO ENOUGH. BUT IF IN THESE PARTICULAR IF WE COULD PUT HIM IN STATUTE. THOSE CONSUMERS I WOULD BE IN A BETTER POSITION. TODAY ABOUT THE WITH THIS BILL THEM WHERE THEY ARE TODAY. IN ADDITION COMMENT -- CENTER IN YOUR PRESENTATION YOU STATED THAT THERE WERE ANCILLARY -- OPTIONS FOR CONSUMERS I DON'T SEE THAT IN THEIR WORTH THIS PROVIDES THAT INFORMATION. TO CONSUMERS OF OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WERE AVAILABLE AND GET IN A A STATEMENT HERE THAT WE WERE AMENDED THAT OUT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MAKING REFERENCE TO BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER IN THE BILL SO. YOU YOU MAY IT IS A STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE THAT. YOU PROVIDED ACCESS TO ANCILLARY OTHER PRODUCTS AND NO THE THE PILOT PROGRAM IS WHAT I WAS REFERRING. TO BECAUSE THE POPE PILOT PROGRAM WAS CREATED HERE BY STATUTE. AND THIS IS A BIT -- AND I'M JUST ONLY. MAKING REFERENCE TO THIS PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAS. FOR MAKING ROOM I'M I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU STATED IN YOUR STATEMENT YOU SAID. OF ALL THE SAFEGUARDS ONE WAS THAT YOU MAY NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OF ANCILLARY OTHER PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS BUT I DON'T KNOW NO I DID NOT SAY THAT I THINK YOU -- WHAT I SAID WAS THAT THERE IS? AN ON OKAY. IT'S BEEN AMENDED UP SORRY I DID MAKE A STATEMENT YOU'RE RIGHT SOUL KEY EIGHT EIGHT I JUST SIX CAN WE AMEND THAT BACK IN AND AND ONE WHAT PREVENTS US FROM PUTTING THOSE SAME SAFEGUARDS IN THAT THE PILOT PROGRAM MASS. I'D HAVE TO KNOW WHAT I WAS MY STAFF PREPARED THIS SO I'M VERY SORRY. THERE WAS SOME SOME CONCERN CONCERNS RAISED AT THE OUTSET THAT MAY BE CONFUSING TO CONSUMERS SO WE HAD INITIALLY MENTORED OUT IN AS IT WAS INTRODUCED IT DID INCLUDE THOSE PROVISIONS. AND WHETHER THOSE WERE BENEFICIAL OR NOT WAS IN QUESTION SO WE'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS WITH YOUR GRACIOUS STAFF HERE TO CLARIFY THAT THAT CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. SO ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS THAT KIND OF LIKE PUT TO SAFEGUARD CHEN THAT THE PILOT PROGRAM AS AND PROVIDE THOSE I MEAN WE TO INITIALLY PROPOSED SOME FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THIS CAME FROM YOUR OFFICE OF TO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS. TO PROVIDE THOSE SAME TO SAFEGUARD SET UP EITHER PROGRAM HOUSE AND IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DO THAT WE DESIGNED THE BILL SO I HAVE THE SAME BECAUSE SENATOR ALSO RAISE SOME GOOD. POINTS ON THERE IT'S AND IT'S REALLY CONCERN BUT ALSO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THESE PRODUCTS EXIST BASED ON WHAT YOU SAID A LOT OF HARD WORKING PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO TRADITIONAL -- BANKING INSTITUTIONS IT'S OVER THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THAT ON BANK WE AREN'T WE CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I THINK WE SHOULDN'T BE LESSENING THOSE SAFEGUARDS AND AND AND SAFETY NET FOR CONSUMERS SO I WOULD YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND-THE START. I'M WHAT YOU WELL I AM I I'M I'M GOING TO ASK THAT YOU TAKE THE MOMENTS THAT AFFECTS -- MIRROR OF WHAT WE HAVE IN A PILOT PROGRAM AND GOING FORWARD YOU FOR WILLING TO DO THAT GOT IT YOU'LL HAVE A MOTION -- IT WOULD MEAN YOU EVER COULD CENTER PORTANTINO.
