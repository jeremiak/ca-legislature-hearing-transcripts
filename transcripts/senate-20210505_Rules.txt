I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING MY APPOINTMENT AS COMMISSIONER OF CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL'S IF NEEDED SIXTEEN COMMISSIONER OF THIS WONDERFUL DEPARTMENT. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY GUARDIAN ANGELS MY PARENTS ALONG WITH MY SIBLINGS EXTENDED FAMILY FRIENDS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE YOUNG MAN I'M FORTUNATE TO CALL MY SON KYLE. THEIR LITTLE SUPPORT HAS BEEN TRULY AMAZING. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF MY UPBRINGING AND HOW I GOT TO WHERE I AM TODAY. THE REASON I WANT TO START HERE IS BECAUSE THIS STARTING POINT. IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME MY FAMILY. THE OAKLAND COMMUNITY I GREW UP IN. AND A DEDICATED WOMEN AND MEN OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. MY UPBRINGING HAS NOT ONLY SHAPED MY VALUES AND BELIEFS BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES ME A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SERVICE EMPATHY AND RELATIONSHIPS THE PUBLIC EXPECTS. AND DESERVES OF ITS LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS. BECAUSE OF WHERE I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN BECAUSE I HAVE COMMITTED THE LAST THIRTY ONE YEARS OF MY LIFE. WORKING WITH UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. I KNOW WE NEED TO ENGAGE WITH ALL THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE EQUALLY WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY AND TO EVALUATE OURSELVES NOT ONLY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A PROFESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. BUT FROM THE PUBLIC'S PERSPECTIVE AS WELL. I HAVE LEARNED AND CONTINUE TO IMPRESS ON ALL OF THOSE THAT I WORK WITH. THAT WE MUST LISTEN. TO THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE NOT JUST TO RESPOND BUT TO UNDERSTAND. AS I'M SURE WE WILL DISCUSS TODAY I HAVE FOUR MAJOR GOALS AS THIS THE H. P.'S NEW COMMISSIONER NUMBER ONE IS TO REIMAGINE AND REBUILD THE TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. NUMBER TWO IS TO ESTABLISH A DIVERSITY H. P. THAT IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. NUMBER THREE IS TO REDUCE DEMOLISH DEATH RATE AS WELL AS INJURIES RELATED TO VIOLENCE ON OUR ROADWAYS AND FINALLY TO IMPROVE EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELLNESS. BUT BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS I LIKE BEING WITH THIS. C. H. P. IS MADE UP OF SOME OF THE MOST DEDICATED WOMEN AND MEN. AND I AM SO HONORED TO WORK ALONGSIDE EVERY MEMBER OF THIS DEPARTMENT. EVERY DAY. IT IS MY DEEP DESIRE THAT WE AS THE LARGEST STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. IN THE NATION. THAT WE ENDEAVOR TOWARDS A MORE CONTEMPORARY INNOVATIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY READY TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. AND THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA DURING THESE HIGHLY DYNAMIC TIMES. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT TO BE TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING A TRUSS. I TRULY APPRECIATE I KNOW IT TRANSPARENCY WHERE POSSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE TO CORNERSTONES OF OUR SUCCESS FURTHERMORE. THE CHP STANDS READY TO COLLABORATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THE PATH OF IMPROVEMENT FOR TOMORROW. SO I FIRMLY BELIEVE. EVERY CHALLENGE EVERY CHALLENGE THAT I'VE HAD THROUGHOUT MY LIFE EVERY TIME IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW. AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE INTROSPECTIVE AND CLOSELY FOCUS ON HOW WE AS PUBLIC SERVICE CAN BETTER SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I KNOW IT IS C. H. P. WILL NEED YOURS AND THE PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE THAT BRIEF STATEMENT. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER I THINK I'M GOING TO GO FIRST OR VICE CHAIRWOMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU. ARE WE HAD A WONDERFUL CONVERSATION YESTERDAY IMAGE. HE MENTIONED I THINK I'M PROBABLY SPEAKING FOR EVERYONE WHO'S NOW QUITE AWARE OF YOUR APPOINTMENT THAT WE ARE ALL THRILLED TO SEE SOMEONE COME FROM. YOU KNOW ENTRY LEVEL RIGHT UP TO THE TOP POSITION AND ESPECIALLY A WOMAN IF I MIGHT- MENTIONED OUT TO BRIEFLY AN IDEA WHEN WE WERE CHATTING IN MY OFFICE PHÃ­ CONGRADULATIONS WE SPOKE ABOUT A NUMBER OF THE THINGS THAT ARE- OF CONCERN ARE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC OUR COMMUNITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK YOUR TOP PRIORITY THERE WHICH WE SPOKE ABOUT IN DEPTH- THE TRUST AND REBUILDING THAT BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR. CERTAINLY OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AND OUR COMMUNITY AT LARGE THAT SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE THERE TO PROTECT AND IN DOING THAT YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE VERY RESPECTFUL AND CAREFUL IN THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU DO THAT PUBLIC SAFETY IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF GOVERNMENT AND YOU'RE ON THE FRONT LINE. ENSURING THAT THAT DOES TAKE PLACE. IT WAS A WITH A WONDERFUL. IDEA TO- MANSION THE CONCERN I HAVEN'T LET ME SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES VERY QUICKLY. COMMISSIONER RAY- OUT OF HER VERY BUSY SCHEDULE TOOK A TRIP TO MY DISTRICT WHERE ONE OF OUR- HIGHWAY PATROLMEN- WHO WAS INJURED ON. AND TOOK TIME OUT OF HER DAY TO GO DOWN VISIT WITH- THE INDIVIDUAL WITH THE- WITH THE HIGHWAY PATROL PERSON AND ALSO WITH THE DISTRICT DOWN THERE IN ASSURING THEM THAT SHE IS ALWAYS ON CALL- TO INTERCEDE OR BE PART OF- ANY- I THINK BUILDING TRUST IN THE COMMUNITY AND THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT ONE SO I THINK THAT. IS BASICALLY STANDS OUT AS A SIGNATURE OF THIS WONDERFUL APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSIONERATE TO THIS POSITION. AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE I HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH. THE HIGHWAY PATROL THAT VERY DAY ON THAT I WAS GOING TO BE SPEAKING WITH A COMMISSIONER AND TODAY'S- THEY MENTIONED IT AND HOW. IT WAS TODAY AND HOW. THEY WERE SO IMPRESSED WITH THAT OUTREACH SO. GOES WITHOUT SAYING ON YOUR FIRST JOB IN MY DISTRICT HE GOT AN A PLUS- THANK YOU AND I TO YOU IF I THINK WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DO YOU AYE DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. OF ALCOHOL DRUGS AND IN PARTICULAR THE OPIOIDS AND CANNABIS AND HOW THAT IS- IT BECOME HAS BECOME THE REAL SERIOUS ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE WAY I TO ASSESS HOW MANY OF THE IMPAIRED DRIVING ACCIDENTS. ARE THE RESULT OF- I THINK THE INTRODUCTION OF THE OPIOID ISSUE AND CERTAINLY MARIJUANA BECAUSE SO COULD YOU SPEAK UP SPECIFICALLY TO. HOW YOU'RE DEALING WITH THAT CURRENTLY THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND I BELIEVE. THE IMPAIRED DRIVING TASK FORCE REPORT. I HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS IN AT- ON HOW TO PURSUE IN TERMS OF DATA DATA COLLECTION. SO COMMISSIONERATE ON COULD YOU SHARE WITH US FOR SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME I THINK A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. ARE CERTAINLY AS WE'VE SEEN THE INCREASE. IN THE USE OF DRUGS AND MORE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHEN YOU DO OUR PULL SOMEONE OVER. I GUESS MEDICAL CHAIR IN. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. AND HAS WE SPOKE ON YESTERDAY AND I WERE JUST STTE AGAIN FOR THE RECORD YOU KNOW ALCOHOL ND DRUG IMPAIRED DRIVING IT CONTINUES TO BE. A LEADING CAUSE OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES AND INJURIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND AT THE HIGHWAY PATROL IS DESIGNATED AS- AS CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE DRUG RECOGNITION EXPERT COORDINATOR AND THAT'S A STATE WIDE DESIGNATION AND WE'RE ALSO NATIONALLY KNOWN IN THAT RESPECT. AND SO WE TRAIN NOT ONLY JUST CHP OFFICERS BUT OFFICE ALSO R. L. AGENCY PARTNERS. AND BOTH THE DRUG RECOGNITION EXPERT COURSES AND ALL THE ADVANCED ROADSIDE IMPAIRED DRIVING ENFORCEMENT COURSE SO- TO DATE WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY CERTIFIED DAIRIES IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE C. H. P. ALONE HAS APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY B. R. EASE. SO ANOTHER THING- FOLLOWING THE LEGISLATION OF THE LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS. OUR DEPARTMENT BEGAN CAPTURING SPECIFIC DRUG CATEGORY INFORMATION FROM CRASHES INVESTIGATED BY THE CHP AND WHICH TO DRIVER WAS SUSPECTED OF BEING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS. AND SO IN TWENTY TWENTY R. CHP OFFICERS SUSPECTED CANNABIS INVOLVEMENT AS SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE CRASHES OCCURRING JUSTIN SEEMS BE JURISDICTIONS. SO HOWEVER THE CHALLENGES WE SPOKE ABOUT YESTERDAY THERE CHALLENGES TO TRACKING THE U. I. DRUG RELATED ACCIDENTS AND D. U. I. DRUG RELATED INCIDENTS- CURRENTLY IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL IMPACT OF CANNABIS LEGALIZATION. AND HOW IT'S AFFECTED OUR CANNABIS IMPAIRED DRIVING INCIDENTS. BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE DOES DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ALCOHOL DUI AND DRUG IMPAIRED THE U. I. THE VEHICLE CODE DOES NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DRUG CATEGORIES SUCH AS CANNABIS OPIOIDS AS YOU SPOKE OF EARLIER BY SUB SECTION. SO AS SUCH THE INCIDENCE OF DRUG IMPAIRED DRIVING ARRESTS BY SPECIFIC DRUGS. OR EVEN CATEGORIES IS NOT TRACKED AND THE STATE LEVEL. I KNOW CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE THIS. WITH A KIND OF THIS IMPAIRED. IT REMAINS THERE IS NOT A SUB NO STANDARD- STATE OR PRESENT LIMIT SUGGESTED POINT ZERO EIGHT BLOOD ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION THE MYTH THAT EXIST WITH ALCOHOL INTOXICATION SO FOR US- HER COMMITMENT TO TRAFFIC SAFETY IN COMBAT A D. U. I. REMAINS. DISEASE P. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE RESEARCH IN THE AREA OF THE U. I. DRUGS TO INCLUDE MEDICINE EVALUATING THE PARAMEDIC. THE CHP WE'RE ALSO MAKING A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY TESTING- I KIND OF THIS TAX BRACKET PHONE PROGRAM THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT AS WELL. AND SO FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GRANT CYCLE WE WERE WE WILL BE AWARDING GRANT FUNDS TO PUBLIC CRIME LABORATORIES- WHICH WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A NEW EQUIPMENT TO IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S TESTING CAPABILITIES. AND TO FACILITATE THEIR RESEARCH I COULD IN THE CANNABIS IMPAIRED DRIVING STUDIES EFFORTS SO WE UP AND TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOME TYPE OF FLUID DRUG SCREENING DEVICES. WE PARTNERING WITH THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS UC SAN DIEGO CENTER FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS RESEARCH UCLA AND A DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES- RESEARCH AND- DEVELOPMENT BRANCH SO SOME OF THE INFORMATION HI THIS IS THIS IS I KNOW IT'S COVERED IN OUR- DRIVING. TASK FORCE REPORT THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT THAT WE SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT WE JUST RELEASED IN MARCH SO S. AND CSP'S EXCAVATION- I AM FULLY COMMITTED TO BRING STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER TO EXAMINE D. Y. ISSUES. IN ORDER TO STRATEGICALLY ALLOCATE RESOURCES AND ENSURE THE HIGHEST LEVEL ROADWAY SAFETY FOR ALL THE CALIFORNIA MOTORISTS AND S. D. YOU I DRUGS. ANDY WHY ALCOHOL. THANK YOU CAN SURE I THINK THAT CERTAINLY COVERED IT VERY AND YOU THIRD PRO. TO REDUCE THE DEATH RATE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THE ACCIDENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED WHEN THERE'S BEEN A DO YOU ARE YOU INVOLVED JOB. TRAGICALLY HAVE TAKEN LIVES SO THAT IS WONDERFUL TO HEAR AND CERTAINLY YOU WILL HAVE. MY SUPPORT AND I'M SURE THEY ARE LEGISLATURE SUPPORTED SHE MOVED FORWARD AND START TO GET THAT THAT FIND TO BE CONFIDENCE BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE SIGNED SPACE FOR SURE. IN TERMS OF HOW YOU DETERMINE SOMEONE IS IN FACT IMPAIR. THAT BASICALLY COVERS ALL ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WANTED T RETURN TO THAT WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION ON. SO I'M GOING TO PASS UP THE MICROPHONE TO. WHOEVER'S NEXT AGAIN YOU SO MUCH FOR. YOUR LONG TIME COMMITMENT TO THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. ASSIGNMENT AND IT IS TRULY PUBLIC SERVICE AND YOU ARE CERTAINLY OFF. STAND OUT IS A- INCREDIBLE PUBLIC SERVANTS AND WISH YOU THE VERY BEST AS YOU GO FORWARD AND NOW SO WONDERFUL. ASSIGNMENT YOU HAVE. AND A LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MORE INTERACTION WITH YOU I'M A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU. SHE DECLINED WORDS. THE ONLY WAY THAT IF I SEE YOU COMING AND I'M DRIVING I WOULD BE VERY VERY CAREFUL. I APPRECIATE THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU. SENATOR BATES THANK YOU SENATOR LAYER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN AND COMMISSIONER THANK SENATOR BATES WAS SPEAKING FOR ALL OF US IF ANY OF ISSUE DRIVING. UP BY WHERE WE ARE I'M FIVE WANTED TO MAKE ONE COMMENT AND I KNOW. S. AS IN ELECTED OFFICIAL ARE YOU CANNOT RESIST THINGS THAT ARE GRATUITOUS. BY YOUR APPOINTMENT TRIGGERED ONE OF MY BILLS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CODE SECTION FOR COMMISSIONER OF THE HIGHWAY PATROL ALL THE REFERENCES ARE TO HE AND HIM. AND SO I HAVE A BILL IN AND EVERYBODY HERE VOTED FOR LAST WEEK ON CONSENT THAT BASICALLY. A CHANGES THOSE REFERENCES TO MATCH WHO YOU ARE NOW AND I'M PLEASED. FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT AND THAT YOU TRIGGERED THAT IT NOW AS AN ASIDE EVERYBODY'S JUMPING ON THE BANDWAGON SOME FIREFIGHTERS HAVE GOTTEN CONSERVATION CORPS TALK TO GENERAL BALDWIN TODAY HE THINKS MAYBE THEY'RE NATIONAL GUARD THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDED SO. ARM ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE BEEN A LEADER. FIVE TWO ENJOYED OUR TALK EARLIER THIS WEEK AND I KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT THE STATE YOU HAD DONE SOME WORK. FIVE YEARS AGO BEFORE YOU APPOINTED COMMISSIONER ON THE PUBLIC. TRUST MEASURE- YOUR PUBLIC TRUST INITIATIVE AND- NOW YOU'RE IN CHARGE SO WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THAT A AND WHAT DID IT MAKE YOU. WANT TO ACT ON NOW THAT YOU'RE THERE. THANK YOU CENTER AND I ALSO THANK YOU FOR THAT- BILL I THAT'S VERY INTUITIVE AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU- CONSIDERING MY TITLE IN THE MAIL IS VERY NICELY- I TELL YOU I THINK WE ALL KNOW THESE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY CHALLENGING TIMES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES- HOWEVER TRULY BELIEVE IT IS A WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IF THESE ARE ALSO INSPIRING TIMES FOR TRUE LEADERS IN THIS PROFESSION. SO AS SUCH YOU KNOW I AM EXCITED ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE I HAVE A TEAM OF VERY TALENTED LEADERS THAT UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TASK OF IT. IN A TASK THAT WE HAVE AHEAD OF US I YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE- PUBLIC TRUST INITIATIVE AND THAT WAS ONE OF MY FOUR MAIN GOALS IS TO REIMAGINE AND TO INVIGORATE THE CHP'S PUBLIC TRUST INITIATIVE. THE FED THE INITIAL PUBLIC TRUST INITIATIVE OF WHICH I WAS A MEMBER OF THE TRAINING TEAM- IT WAS BEGAN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN WE ESTABLISH THAT INITIATIVE AND IT HAD THREE- UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES ONE WAS. YOU KNOW WAS THAT WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO- INTERACT WITH OUR PUBLIC FROM A DIFFERENT STANDPOINT AND ONE OF THEM WAS THAT WE WOULD USE RESPECT AND DIGNITY AND THAT WE WOULD INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC FROM A PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING. FROM INTEGRITY WHERE WE WOULD LOOK AT IT NOT JUST FROM THE WAY WE SEE THE PUBLIC BUT FOR THE WAY THEY SEE US AND THEN ALSO THAT AS AN APARTMENT WE WOULD CREATE A UNIFIED VISION. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WAS INTERACTING WITH THE PUBLIC IN THE SAME MANNER AND I COULD TELL YOU- AND FOR US THE OVERLYING PART OF THAT IS IF WE HAVE THESE-RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PUBLIC. IT WOULD HELP US TO ESTABLISH A DEPARTMENT THAT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND. I AM FULLY COMMITTED IT. THE EXAMINEE AWARENESS OF. RESEARCH OUR IMPROVE HIRING PRACTICE. TO BE ABLE TO. MOVE TOWARDS THAT END- FURTHER THAN WHERE WE ARE NOW. AND ALSO I'M FULLY DEDICATED TO FOCUSING ON OUR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. ON ATTRACTING QUALIFIED CANDIDATES OF ALL DEMOGRAPHICS AND GENDERS. WHILE PASSIVELY SEEKING DEMING SEEKING OUT NEW WAYS TO REACH ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. SO THAT PUBLIC TRUST INITIATIVE. IN THE END I WAS THE A BIG PART OF WHAT IS WHICH IS DESIGNED TO DO. WAS REALLY JUST TO HELP THE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE OUR FOOTPRINT IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNOW THAT AND- THE WORLD RELATIONSHIPS YOU KNOW WE'VE MEET WHERE WE HAVE. RELATIONSHIPS IN THE COMMUNITY KNOWS US AND THEY KNOW THAT WE ARE THEIR HIGHWAY PATROL. AND THAT IS THE WAY THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT WOULD MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO BECOME A PART OF OUR TEAM. AND THEN ALSO FOR THE COMMUNITY TO BE THE FEEL SAFE KNOWING THAT WE ARE OUT THERE. TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS A SAFE PLACE. TO LIVE WORK IN TRAVEL. WITH A YOU YOU KNOW MY MEXICO. WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT RECRUITMENT AND YOU WRAP THAT IN QUITE NICELY SO THANK YOU AND THEN AND THE LAST THING. I THOUGHT I WOULD ASK ABOUT IS. AND I THINK UNTIL I WAS SECRETARY FOR RESOURCES I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL'S OF ROLE IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE ED AND- YOU WERE NICK WILL PARTNER. WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES CAL FIRE OF THE NATIONAL GUARD. OF THE FOUR LEADERS WERE OUT FRONT ALL THE TIME. END OF IT SEEMS LIKE. AS WE HEAD INTO MORE FIRE INTO A- PROJECT WE HAD SOME THINGS AROUND THE CAPITAL EARLIER THIS YEAR. EMERGENCY RESPONSE IS A KEY PART OF YOUR POSITION- HOW DO YOU VIEW THAT HOW DO YOU PLAN FOR THIS IT IN YOUR ROLES COMMISSIONER. I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THROUGHOUT MY THIRTY ONE YEARS WE'VE CONTINUED TO GROW AS A DEPARTMENT THAT THE MISSION OF THE HIGHWAY PATROL- IS TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SAFETY SERVICE AND SECURITY SO THAT SAYS A LOT IN ITSELF. IN THIS INCLUDES NOT ONLY PATROLLING STATE AND COUNTY ON ROADWAYS ARE PROTECTING STATE PROPERTY AND INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING THE STATE CAPITAL SO AS A STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WE'RE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE TO ASSEMBLE PROTEST IN A LEGAL MANNER BUT SO TO THAT END I WOULD TELL YOU THAT- THAT FOR US- WE LOOK AT THAT FROM THE BEST PLACES TO ENSURE PERSONAL PROFESSIONAL. DEDICATED AND HIGHLY TRAINED TO SAFEGUARD THE PUBLIC ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES AND THAT INCLUDES A FAIR AND FIERSTEIN'S AND BILL SAYING WE ARE OUR RESPONSE IS NOT LIKE I STATED EARLIER IS NOT JUST TO. PROTEST BUT ALSO HELPING OUR ALLIED AGENCY PARTNERS WHICH INCLUDE CAL FIRE AND OTHER TRAFFIC STAKEHOLDERS AND CAL FIRE AND- IS A BIG PART OF THAT AND THEN WE- ARE VERY FORTUNATE AND HAVE A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND- IN HELP KEEP CALIFORNIA SAFE DURING FIRE SEASON. AS WE KNOW THAT'S A BEING ALWAYS WE'RE HERE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ACTUALLY GET A COUPLE PRESS CONFERENCES TOGETHER NOW WHAT IS BEING DONE TODAY BY ONE OF MY SYSTEM COMMISSIONERS AND STANDING IN FOR ME. TO CONDUCT A PRESS CONFERENCE BASICALLY JUST MAKING CALIFORNIA WHERE THAT WE ARE IN FIRE SEASON SO PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHICH THROWING A LIT I HAVE SIX I LIKE CIGARETTES OUT OF CAR WINDOWS IN THE BRUSH AND JUST BEING VERY CAREFUL THAT WE- DON'T USE- CARELESSNESS AND MAKE CARELESS. MISTAKES THAT BILL ACTUALLY EXACERBATE THAT FIRE SEASON. IN THE SITUATION THAT WILL BE GOING INTO. THANK YOU A YOU MAY. I'M REALLY TO BE. TO YOU WHEN WE GET TO. THANK YOU SIR I THAT STAFF. THANK SENATOR LAYERED- SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEN NM. IT'S A PLEASURE TO VISIT WITH YOU AGAIN- COMMISSIONERATE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THAT YOU GAVE ME YESTERDAY- I LEARNED A LOT IN AND I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU ANSWERED FOR ME YESTERDAY. AS MY COLLEAGUE AND SENATOR LAYERED ASKED TO THE QUESTIONS I WAS GONNA ASK AND MISS BATES COVERED THE CANNABIS AND ALCOHOL ISSUE ON THAT THE DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE SO I'LL GO BACK TO. THE SWING SPACE- AS WE DISCUSSED YESTERDAY YOU KNOW THAT ALL OF US ARE GOING TO BE MOVING INTO THE SWING SPACE I BELIEVE IN OCTOBER RIGHT AFTER SESSION M. IS OVER AND SO- SAME QUESTION I ASKED YOU YESTERDAY- IS IT YOUR- ANTICIPATION OR YOUR- UNDERSTANDING OR DIRECTION THAT. WE WILL BE COVERED BY C. H. P. THAT PROTECTION AT THE SWING SPACE AS WELL- YES MA'AM WE ARE FULLY PREPARED AND HAVE BEEN- WORKING TOWARDS AN END TO BE ABLE TO AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. PROTECTION AT THE SWING SPACE AS WELL AS AS THE CAPITAL I'M WHILE BACK NEW ANNEXES BEING BUILT SO YES WE'VE BEEN A PART OF THE PLANNING SESSIONS AND A PART OF- THAT LOOKING AT THE- CYCLE ABILITY AND CONDUCTING THOSE ASSESSMENTS SO THAT WE CAN SEE IF THERE IS ANY TYPE OF ISSUES AND THINGS THAT WE CN SEE FROM OUR STANDPOINT- FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY STANDPOINT THAT WE CAN MAKE SUGGESTIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO CONSIDER DURING THE- DEVELOPMENT IN IT OF THAT ACTUAL SWING SPACE SO YES NO WE'RE HONORED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT PROTECTION. TO ALL THE LEGISLATURE IN THE MEMBERS. OF THE CAPITAL OF PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MA'AM CAN WE ALSO TALK A LITTLE BIT YESTERDAY ABOUT AND- THE RIGHTS AND THINGS THAT HAPPENED- LAST SUMMER AND- I SHARED WITH YOU THAT WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE BASEMENT THERE WAS A CHP OFFICER BEING BROUGHT BACK IN WITH TWO OF HIS BUDDIES AND HE'S WALKING ON HIS OWN TWO FEET BUT- THEY'RE BOTH NEXT TO HIM AND HIS HEAD WAS BLEEDING HE WAS HIT IN THE HEAD WITH A BOTTLE. OF WATER A LOT ABOUT IT WAS STILL THE SAME IT. AND WHAT'S YOUR PLAN. IS THE HIGHEST RANKING. YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT CHP OFFICER IN THE ENTIRE STATE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THOSE MEN AND WOMEN THAT DO THIS PUBLIC SERVICE AND PROVIDE. SAFETY AND SECURITY FOR OUR COMMUNITY I'M HAPPY WITH THE RISING. ISSUES GOING ON BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE COMMUNITY HOW ARE WE GOING TO KEEP LAW ENFORCEMENT. SAFE WELL I TELL YOU I THINK WITH- WHEN IT COMES TO KEEPING A STATE. IT IS ALWAYS GOING TO GO BACK TO TRAINING HAVING A POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL MAKE SURE THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE WELL TRAINED AND THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING IS WITHIN THE LAW AND WITH THE POLICY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. POSTURED TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT. OUR CITIZENS RIGHT TO OUR THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO PROTEST PEACEFULLY BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN KEEP OUR SALES AND SERVICE AND SAFE WHILE THEY'RE DOING SO- SO WHAT I THINK I TELL YOU WHAT WE DO IS WE- WE REGULARLY ASSESS. OUR CIVIL DISTURBANCE OPERATIONAL PLANS TO ENSURE DEPARTMENTAL PERSONNEL ARE INFORMED AND EQUIPPED TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCY EVENTS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WE CONSTANTLY STRESS PREPARATION TO ADJUST OUR OPERATIONAL POSTURE AS THE PARSER OSTER IN EXCESS OF THE PROTESTERS CHANGE BECAUSE DURING THAT TIME I THINK WE SPOKE ABOUT SOME OF IT AS YOU STATED JUST NOW. WE'VE EXPERIENCED A LOT WITH THAT THE LAST THING WE HAD PEOPLE CLIMB OVER BARRIER WE HAD- BOTTLES BRICKS ROCKS- KIND OF PAINS- BETTER BAND- TOSSED AWAY AND THROWN. ONE OF THEM A WHICH YOU SAW WHICH HASN'T HAPPENED THERE AT THE CAPITOL. BUT ONE OF THINGS WE ALSO EXPERIENCE LIKE I TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY IT'S BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER PROTESTS- THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED AND- THAT HAVE ENCOURAGE JUST READ GOT TO REEVALUATE OUR CIVIL DISTURBANCE TRAINING. SO ONE OF THE THINGS IS THIS WEEK'S WEAVER STRATEGICALLY PIVOTED TO FOCUS ON ARE CLICKABLE LOS OUR DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES AND DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES SO- I SEE IT IS. FROM MY STANDPOINT AS US TAKING A MORE COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO TRAINING TO MAKE SURE OUR PERSONNEL ARE HIGHLY CHINESE BUILDING PROFESSIONAL. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS- I WOULD TELL YOU- AS I THINK IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE LEARNED AND THAT WE- CHANGING. IS THAT WE AVAIL OURSELVES OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE POSITIVE INTERACTIONS WITH THE COMMUNITIES WE. SERVE A LOT OF FORCED ME TO PASS THE THAT WAS- ALSO VERY- AND THEY'LL ALSO VERY OF. MOMENT THAT WE HAVE. WELL WE'RE OVER AT THE- I'M DOING SOME OF THOSE FROM. AND MASS. AND SO I'VE LIKE WE- TO STEP INTO OUR COMMUNITIES ALLOW FOR MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS. IN WHICH TO SEE HPC AS- A RESPONSIBLE AMOUNT OF TIME LISTENING TO OUR COMMUNITY. CONCERNS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY JUST INCREASING OUR ACCESSIBILITY SO THAT OUR COMMUNITY THING IN OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS KNOW. WHO WE ARE WHAT WE DO. AND WHAT DEPARTMENT OR SERVICES AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND LITERALLY I REALLY FEEL LIKE- WHEN WE WENT OUT THERE WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE PROTESTERS. THAT THAT WAS A VALUABLE DURING A PROTEST IN SUMMER I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARN. WE LEARN WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND SOMETIMES JUST THAT SIMPLE CONVERSATION EASE TENSIONS IT PROVIDED PARAMETERS AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET PARAMETERS AND HAVE UNDERSTANDING. WITH SOME OF THOSE PROTESTERS THEY WE WERE ABLE TO USE THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER SO AGAIN I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER A LOT OF THAT IS- RELATIONSHIPS. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS FROM AN EMPLOYEE STANDPOINT. WAS WHILE WE WERE COMMITTED YOU KNOW. TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO ENHANCE TRUST WITH OUR COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW WE ALSO KNOW WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE THE WELL BEING OF OUR- OUR DEDICATED WOMEN AND MEN THAT ARE OUT THERE. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW LAST SUMMER YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE ON TACTICAL ALERT WORLD TWELVE ARE RECEIVED AND WE WERE DOING THOSE THINGS. WE WERE CONSTANTLY MONITORING ARE PLEADING WELLNESS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN A HIGHLY COMPETENT. PROFESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU MA'AM THANK VERY MUCH. I AM WORKING VERY APOLOGY I AM. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THERE IS A LOT OF MEDIA ATTENTION ABOUT YOU BEING THE FIRST WOMAN APPOINTED AND TO THIS POSITION AND I'M HONORED I MEAN I THINK THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING I'M THE FIRST FEMALE VETERAN THAT'S EVER SERVED IN THIS CAPITAL. AND I WEAR THAT BADGE WITH PRIDE AND YOU BEING THE FIRST WOMAN COMMISSIONER THE CALIFORNIA STATE HIGHWAY PATROL. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT- AND YOU'RE IN THAT POSITION BECAUSE YOU'RE QUALIFIED. AND I'M I'M GLAD YOU'RE A WOMAN BUT YOU ARE IN THAT POSITION BECAUSE YOU'RE QUALIFIED AND NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE A WOMAN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONFIRMATION.

I THINK I WANT TO ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID THAT IF I SEE YOU COMING WHILE I'M TEMPTED TO PROBABLY GO FASTER I WILL SLOW DOWN. RIGHT TO OBEY THE LAW- VERY HAPPY TO- HERE YOU STATE YOUR- FOR PRIORITIES- AND IT'S ALWAYS- IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HEAR FOLKS TALK ABOUT THE STAFF THAT- SERVE IN THESE DEPARTMENTS- BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT OUR HUMAN CAPITAL THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT- AND THAT WE WANT TO EMPOWER AND SO RECRUITMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THEN HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF OUR EMPLOYEES IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- WELL REPRESENTATION IS IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY. YOU ALSO WANT FOLKS THAT ARE HAPPY DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND FEELING AS IF THEY ARE SUPPORTED- AND SO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS SO I AND I DID SHARE WITH YOU THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK IT- DURING TODAY. AROUND DIVERSITY IN RECRUITMENT AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE A MORE REPRESENTATIVE WORKFORCE HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS- IT WAS NOTED THAT- THERE WERE A NUMBER OF. YOU KNOW PEOPLE OF COLOR. WHO SORT OF FAILED OUT I THINK DURING WEAPONS TRAINING. NO NO DURING THE DRIVING EXAMS BUT THEN THE WOMEN TENDED TO FAIL OUT DURING THE WEAPONS EXAMS AND IT WAS ALSO NOTED- IN THE READING THAT THE FAIL RATE HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SO THERE HAS BEEN SOME WORK DONE TO IT- REALLY ADDRESS- THE ATTRITION RATES AND I WAS WANTING IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK TO. WHAT CHANGED OUR THAT ALLOWED YOU ALL TO SEE A CHANGE IN THAT TREND. FROM THANK YOU MA'AM YES HI I TELL YOU ONE OF THE THINGS LIKE I STATED EARLIER WAS- BEING ABLE TO COME UP THROUGH THE RANKS GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK. AT SOME OF OUR PROCESSES PROCEDURES AND THAT GOES ALL THE WAY FROM THE KING AT OUR ACADEMY AND LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP MAKE THIS TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL WHETHER THEY'RE AT THE ACADEMY AND WE LOOK AT OUR TRADITION RATE. AND ACADEMY AND WE HAD A LOT OF OUR AND WE SAW THAT WE HAD ABOUT ABOUT A 40% OR 30% DEPEND ON WHAT THE WHICH CLASS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A REFERENCE STATE. THAT WE WERE HAVING THAT TYPE OF THE SITUATION AND ARE DRIVING AND OUR- WEAPONS TRAINING AS YOU STATED EARLIER WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND WE TOOK A HARD LOOK AT IT AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT IT WHEN WE- TALK ABOUT OUR OUR DRIVING WHICH WE- WE CALL OUR EVE UP COURSES. WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE A SEAT AND WE WERE OURS ARE ARE VERY STANDARDS HAVE FAR EXCEEDED. WHAT THE POLL STANDARDS WERE FOR OUR DRIVING BUT ALSO WE LOOKED AT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE PROVIDE THEM WITH MORE TRAINING SAID MAYBE WE CAN YOU KNOW HELP SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE HAVING A HARD TIME. NAVIGATING THAT COURSE AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DID YOU KNOW WITH A TRAINING OF THE CADETS VOLUNTEERED TO COME IN AFTER HOURS WHENEVER THEY DIDN'T. AND WE PROVIDED ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND YOU KNOW AND IT'S IT WAS PRETTY IF YOU LOOK AT IT JUST FROM THAT STANDPOINT I THINK MOST FOR MOST PEOPLE THE MORE YOU DO SOMETHING THE BETTER YOU GONNA GET AT IT AND- AND THEY DID THAT AND WE WERE ABLE TO. I MEAN DISINTEREST SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING- DECREASE THAT FAILURE RATE AND NOW I'M J. U. THAT WE'RE DOWN TO THE SIX SIMILAR KIND OF DUMPING THAT WE DID WITH THE- WITH THE SHOOTING AND WE'RE DOWN TO I BELIEVE HAD ATTRITION RATES IN THOSE TWO CATEGORIES. THAT SOMETIME TO BAN ADAM 0025% AND THEN 10% SO IT'S BEEN A VERY IS VERY BENEFICIAL FOR US AS A DEPARTMENT BECAUSE CLEARLY. WE PUT A LOT. OF A LOT OF WORK AND EFFORT INTO RECRUITING HE FOLLOWED. INTO AND WE GET THEM TO THEY CAN WE- WANT TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE HIGH. QUALITY TRAINING. HOPE IT TAKE A COME OUT AND BE OF OUR TEAM. SO WHATEVER CAN DO THE TO. THOSE CHANGES WE WILL AND WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING AND BEING REFLECTIVE INTROSPECTIVE ACROSS ALL ASPECTS OF THE ACADEMY. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE STARTED WHEN I WAS- THE CHIEF THE US- THERE WAS WORKING FOR THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WITH THE SAP SITE. AND WE HADN'T BEEN DOING THAT CONSISTENTLY. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT MOVING FORWARD. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT- I HAVE TO SAY WELL I WAS. LISTENING TO YOU I NOTICED THAT YOU ARE ON TREND BECAUSE YOU HAVE A FIDDLE LEAF FG IN THE BACKGROUND. SO HOPEFULLY SOMEONE TECHNOLOGY IS THAT- YOU KNOW WE ALSO TALKED A LOT ABOUT- THE- MISCONDUCT SOME MISCONDUCT THAT WAS- SORT OF REVEALED IN A NUMBER OF ARTICLES- EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT SOME SCANDALS I GUESS- WITH SOME OFFICERS THERE WERE A COUPLE OF ARTICLES AROUND FRAUDULENT OVERTIME PAY I DIDN'T GET THAT THE EAST LA OFFICE BUT THEN ALSO SOME INCIDENTS WHERE- WOMEN WERE- HARASSED- I THINK BY ONE OR A COUPLE OF- OFFICERS. AND THOSE FOLKS I DO KNOW WERE- DISCIPLINED APPROPRIATELY BUT WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO HOW YOU ARE- INSURING THAT OFFICERS ARE CONDUCTING THEMSELVES PROFESSIONALLY BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BUILDING TRUST IT'S- THE INTERFACE THAT OFFICERS HAVE YOU KNOW WHAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW FOLKS ARE BEING TREATED- IN. YES ABSOLUTELY- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IS TWO FOLD I KNOW THAT- NUMBER ONE IS HIS WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR POLICY IS THE POLICY OF THE HIGHWAY PATROL THE TREAT EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC MISTER RESPECT AND FAIRNESS AND INSURE ALL OF OUR PRACTICES ARE ETHICAL AND EQUITABLE. AND THESE ORGANIZATIONAL VALUES THESE ARE THE FOUNDATION OF OUR OF WHAT WE DO AND ALSO PART OF THE CULTURE AWARENESS TRAINING THAT WE PROVIDE TO ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND SO THAT TRAINING PROVIDERS ARE SEEKING EMPLOYEES WITH STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESSFUL CONTACTS WITH INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES RACIAL OR ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS AS WELL AS- DETAILING THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOGNIZING AND RESPECTING THE COMPLEXITIES OF CULTURAL DIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING ON OUR DEPARTMENT SO- I BELIEVE THAT TRAINING- REALLY- THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BACKGROUND THE BACKBONE OF THAT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO WITH MISCONDUCT. ALSO THE PUBLIC RIGHTFULLY EXPECTS ONLY THE HIGHEST STANDARDS FROM OUR EMPLOYEES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT HAVE FAITH THAT THE CHP WILL FULLY INVESTIGATE ANY ALLEGATION OF MISCONDUCT AND A THOROUGH OBJECTIVE AND TIMELY MANNER AND MOREOVER LIKE WITH US THE PUBLIC EXPECTS THAT IF NECESSARY THAT WE WILL TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO SAFEGUARD THE TRI STATE THAT WE HAVE BUILT WITH OUR COMMUNITIES AND I'LL TELL YOU AS A COMMISSIONER. I CAN ASSURE YOU WE WILL MEET THAT EXPECTATION FOR ME OUR PROACTIVE APPROACH FOR ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY STARTS WITH SOUND POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND COUPLED WITH ON GOING TO SUSTAIN TRAINING AND THAT TRAINING BEGINS AT THE ACADEMY SO I EXPECT EVERY MEMBER TO SEIZE PETRI THE FELLOW EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC WE SERVE OR RESPECT AND FAIRNESS AND INSURER PRACTICES. ARE A ETHICAL AND EQUITABLE AND THESE ARE THE ORGANIZATIONAL VALUES THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE DO BUT I TELL YOU THAT IF- IN THE END. IF THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT I'M SHOWS THAT WE HAVE TO GO GOOD FOR. WE ALSO- IN THE DAY ASSIST. THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THAT WE CAN USE IT WILL ACTUALLY TELL US IF THERE'S ANY TRENDS OR ANYTHING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT. WHERE THERE IS A WAY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MONITORING OUR SALES AND MONITORING OUR WORK SPACE INSURING. THAT THOSE THINGS WILL HAPPEN BUT IF THEY DO THEN YOU WILL YOU KNOW WE WILL TAKE THE APPROPRIATE ACTION AS YOU STATED EARLIER. TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY OF THOSE IF ANY DEFICIENCY ARE CONCERNS IDENTIFY. THAT IS PROBABLY ADDRESS THROUGH CONSTRUCTIVE INTERVENTION STRATEGIES THAT BASICALLY INCLUDES COUNSELING TRAINING AND OUR OTHER PROGRAMS AS A PRIMARY INTERVENTIONS- BACK INCLUDE UP TO TERMINATION IF NECESSARY. WELL I CAN JUST WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THIS THAT YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE AND- YOU KNOW SIX YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN INCIDENT- ON THE TEN FREEWAY- BETWEEN A CHP OFFICER AND- AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN MARLENE PANIC. THAT THE IT WAS CAPTURED ON VIDEO IT WENT VIRAL AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE RESPONSE FROM CHP WAS SWIFT IMMEDIATELY TALKING ABOUT ADDITIONAL TRAINING THAT. OFFICERS NEEDED- IN REALLY SORT OF MOVING FRONT AND CENTER ISSUES AROUND MENTAL ILLNESS AND WORKING WITH FOLKS WHO ARE ON HOUSED IN HOW TO DO THAT IN A WAY THAT WAS APPROPRIATE- AND I WAS. SURPRISED PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH THE H. P. TOOK THE INCIDENT- AND THE STEPS THAT THEY- WORK TO ENACT A RATHER QUICKLY. I WITH REGARDS TO OUR RESPONSE ON A GO FORWARD BASIS IN TERMS OF TRAINING AND HELPING OFFICERS UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OTHER THAN- BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN IT- THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU SENATOR- THE COMMISSIONER- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THIS IS A CONFIRMATION- BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT'S A THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE CONVERSATION AND DIALOGUE- I JOIN MY COLLEAGUES. IN THE APPRECIATION OF YOUR LAYING OUT VERY QUICKLY AT THE BEGINNING YOUR GOALS- I PARTICULARLY YOU LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT RE IMAGINING- LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS DAY IN TIME AND HOW TO HELP THE DEPARTMENT MOVE FORWARD. IN A POSITIVE WAY FOR BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY- THE DIVERSITY ISSUE I AM IN MY FIFTH YEAR ON THE RULES COMMITTEE. AND I REMEMBER OF THE CONFIRMATION OF FORMER COMMISSIONER WARREN STANLEY AND TALKING ABOUT DIVERSITY AND TALKING ABOUT THE- ISSUES OUTLINED BY SENATOR COM LONGER AROUND. THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES AND WHY A KID IT'S WOULD DO WELL IN SOME AREAS NOT OTHERS AND TO LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGES AND NUMBERS- REFLECTING. THE MAKE UP COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE- POPULATION SO THE FACT THAT YOU. OUTLINED THAT DIVERSITY AND YOU'RE ABLE TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT QUESTIONS THAT I ASK IS A RULES COMMITTEE MEN MEMBER UNDER THE FORMER PRO TEM. ABOUT BOTH DRIVING AND SHOOTING AND IT'S EASY TO SEE AS THE CHIEF AN ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER. BETWEEN THEN AND NOW ALL THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME WORK DONE IN THAT AREA SO I TRULY APPRECIATE THAT. AS WELL AS THE FOCUS ON EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OUR- AND CERTAINLY REDUCING DEATHS THE FACT THAT YOU'RE VERY CLEAR. ABOUT THAT FOCUS- YEAH REALLY AND IT REMINDS ME OF ACTUALLY RUN INTO YOU IN THE BASEMENT OF THE CAPITOL- AS WE WERE BUT YOU WERE. MOVING TO HIGH ALERT AROUND SECURITY IN THE CAPITAL AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY HELLO BUT YOU WERE ALL BUSINESS YOU WERE ON TASK AND YOU WERE HOT YOU HAD A MISSION AND- I COULD TELL THAT. WE WERE GOING TO BE WELL SERVED AND JUST YOU'RE KEEPING US POSTED AND THAT WAS RELATIVELY SOON AFTER YOU WERE. APPOINTED IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY IT WASN'T THAT LONG AFTER. OUT WE HAD TO DEAL WITH A NUMBER OF THINGS SO. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE- YOUR PROFESSIONALISM YOUR- YOUR DEDICATION AND TO WHAT A SENATOR GROVE SAID. YOUR ABSOLUTE QUALIFICATIONS TO DO THIS JOB. I- WANTED TO SAY ALSO HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE REPRESENTING SAN DIEGO I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR THE PREVIOUS. CHP FACILITY- WHICH WAS LACKING- SIGNIFICANTLY IN TERMS OF SPACE AND AVAILABILITY AND NEEDS FOR THE OFFICERS THERE. TO THE NEW ONE WHICH IS SO NICE. YOU KNOW TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT WE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT OUR STAFF AND THEY DESERVE A FACILITY. I KNOW THAT. ARE REPLACING SOME OF THOSE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAS A SLOW DOWN A BIT- MAYBE WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND ONE TIME FUNDS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASSIST IN THAT REGARD JUST MY OWN THOUGHT- I KNOW THAT MOST OF THE RESOURCES TO FIND C. H. P. COME FROM- MOTOR VEHICLE FEES. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT- WHEN WE CAN GET A HIT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SPACE FOR OUR OFFICERS I DID WANT TO ASK A QUESTION- IN TERMS OF. THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS ARE. EMPLOYED YOU KNOW I HAVE TO WONDER IF WE ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH OFFICERS ARE SAN DIEGO. I KNOW IT'S A BIG AREA I THINK THAT THE COVERAGE AREA FOR CHP THERE IS BROADER THAN JUST SAN DIEGO COUNTY IT MIGHT INCLUDE PARTS OF IMPERIAL IF I'M CORRECT AND I JUST I KNOW YOU ARE SLOTTED A BUDGET I KNOW YOU ARE SLOTTED A NUMBER OF ARM. SLIGHTS BUT- WONDERING IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO DO ALL THAT IS PUT ON YOUR PLATE UP AND DOWN THE STATE I IN THE HUNDRED AND THREE KIND OF OFFICES AND FACILITIES THAT YOU HAVE. WELCOME MA'AM GREAT QUESTION THERE WELL IT'S A IS- I THINK I WOULD HAVE BIG BIG THE MOST OF THE WORLD WE WERE HEAVILY AFFECTED BY. COLGATE AND WITHIN THAT THAT WITH OUR ACADEMY SO- WHEN KOHLI HIT YOU KNOW I HAD WAITED CLOSE DOWN ACADEMY THE FIRST TIME UNDER COMMISSIONER STANLEY AND THEN AGAIN UNDER- WHEN I BECAME THE COMMISSIONER SO THAT WAS TWO TIMES WE HAD TO CLOSE IT DOWN AND THEN ALSO- WHICH AFFECTED HER GRADUATION RATE AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE- THE REPLACE OFFICERS AS OTHER PEOPLE RETIREE. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT HAPPENED WHEN WE HAD TO CLOSE IT DOWN THE SECOND TIME WE WERE ABLE TO OPEN IT- WE HAD OPENED IT DIFFERENTLY WE HAD THAT WILL TO HAVE A REINTEGRATION PLAN THAT INCLUDED ONLY RUNNING ONE CLASS AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF THAT CLASS SO THAT WE CAN PLAY GOOD DEBTS IN THEIR OWN SEPARATE SPACES. SO WE'VE YOU KNOW WE'VE WE HAVE A PLAN TO THE YOU KNOW THIS ONE CLASS IS GOING TO GRADUATE IN JULY AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT MORE BODIES IN THERE AND THAT PLANS BEEN SUCCESSFUL SO FAR FOR US TO BE ABLE TO- GET THIS CLASS GRADUATED IN MAY. THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO STAY SAFE THROUGHOUT THIS TIME SO WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT MEASURES WE PUT IN PLACE SO HOPEFULLY AS WE INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF THE CLASSES AND GET BACK TO AND WE GET- EVERYONE BEING ABLE TO GET BACK AND RUNNING MULTIPLE CLASSES BACK TO BACK WE WILL BE ABLE TO. TAP INTO THOSE NUMBERS AND GET OUR NUMBERS BACK UP TO YOU KNOW WHERE WE WERE WE WERE AND WHERE WE NEED TO BE AND WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BE SO THAT'S- YOU KNOW SO I'M I'M VERY VERY- HOPEFUL THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT AS WELL. WELL THANK YOU HAVE A PLAN THAT WE THERE IS A PLAN IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS INDICATE MORE BODIES THROUGH- THE ACADEMY AND TO GET THEM MORE BODIES OUT ON THE ROAD OKAY SO IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE A PRACTICAL ISSUE. IN ADDITION TO NOT JUST A FINANCIAL RESOURCES ISSUE RIGHT. OKAY I ONLY HAD ONE LAST QUESTION BIG MIKE. ASKED ALL OF THE QUESTIONS WERE. TO OFFICER TO AND AN ACCEPT DRUG IN TERMS OF- HOUSING IN PAST DISCUSSIONS WITH CHP WE LEARNED THAT GRADUATING OFFICERS ARE GIVEN THE OPTION IN THE DISTRICT WHERE THEY LIVE PROVIDED THEY OWN A HOME IN THAT LOCATION. WHAT OTHER FACTORS DO YOU CONSIDER WHEN MAKING PLACEMENT DECISIONS HAS THE DEPARTMENT EVER CONSIDERED EXPANDED THE OPTION TO WORK FOR A LIVING COMMUNITIES THEY HAVE CLOSE TIES TO. REGARDLESS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP I THINK THAT GETS MAYBE IN SOME PIECES TO THE DIVERSITY ISSUE OR THE- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT AND I DIDN'T. WARN YOU I WAS GOING TO ASK THIS QUESTION SO. NO WORRIES AT ALL MAN- ACTUALLY THIS IS- AREA THAT WE TACKLED ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND WE ACTUALLY JUST WE DID CHANGE OUR POLICY. WITH REGARD TO- EXPANDING THAT THAT WAS A CONCERN OF MINE AS WELL WHEN I REVIEWED ON HOW WE EVALUATE WORK AT THAT IS GOING TO GO. SO WE DID EXPAND THAT NOT JUST THAT YOU HAVE TO OWN A HOME BUT EVEN IF YOU'RE THERE ARE YOU SHOWED YOUR FROM THAT COMMUNITY. THAT THOSE ARE FACTORS THAT ARE NOW CONSIDERED AN WHERE THEY COULD DANCE WILL BE ABLE TO GO AFTER THEY GRADUATE SO YES BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE RENTING SOME PEOPLE HAVE APARTMENTS THAT DOESN'T STAY STILL MAJOR PART OF THAT COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW NOT JUST OWNING A HOME SO WE DID EXPAND THOSE PARAMETERS. THANK YOU WELL THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. I'M I APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMENTS AND- I REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE ACTUALLY PROMOTED TO ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER CHIEF AN ASSISTANT- THAT WAS A BIG DEAL THAT WAS- A PROMOTION THAT WAS NOTED BECAUSE- OF. OUR EYES THE FACT THAT YOU'RE A WOMAN THE FIRST WOMAN OBVIOUSLY A TRAILBLAZER. AGAIN WELL QUALIFIED IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE. YOU HERE TODAY AND TO GET TO HEAR FROM YOU VERY DIRECTLY YOUR VISIONS AND YOUR- YOUR WORK IN YOUR HOPES FOR- MOVING CHP FORWARD AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF YOUR OFFICERS. AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITIES SO. YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MA'AM I BELIEVE THE TIME OF ALL THE YOU AND REALLY GIVEN ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AS I TELL YOU- YOU KNOW WHY IN TALKING WITH SENATOR LAYERED HAVE DEFINITELY NOT READY YET TO GO TO SHADY PINES WITH THE REST OF THE GOLDEN GIRLS THERE'S MORE WORK. AND I REALLY WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT THE WORK IN THAT EFFORT. YOU FOR- YOU OBVIOUSLY TAPPED INTO SENATOR LAYERED SENSE OF HUMOR. THIS IS WHY SHE'S BEEN PROMOTED AGAIN AND AGAIN OBVIOUSLY. NO IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN AN ENJOYABLE CONVERSATION WE'RE GOING TO GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC NOW UNLESS OR FURTHER COME. TO SENATOR GROWTH PLEASE I DID NOTICE SOMETHING WHEN MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WAS ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE QUALIFICATION PRACTICES FOR WOMEN BEING LOWER THAN MEN AND I DID NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE AN EXPERT RANGE BADGE ON YOUR POCKET. AND SO OBVIOUSLY IT DIDN'T AFFECT YOU VERY MUCH US MA'AM IS THAT NIGHT AND LIKE THE REST OF THE PEOPLE LIKE I SAID I REALLY I WORK MY BEHIND OFF I WAS NOT A GREAT SHOT WHEN I GOT THERE BUT YOU KNOW THEY WORK WITH ME AND I WAS ABLE TO- BECOME PRETTY DARN GOOD AT IT. WITH A LOT OF WORK. IN A MATTER. THANK YOU SENATOR LIAR. I FEEL OBLIGATED TO EXPLAIN. IF YOU JUST SAY THAT ONE I WENT THROUGH MY OWN CONFIRMATION HEARING SINCE I PLAY ON A TRIVIA TEAM NAMES SHADY PINES. I WAS CHALLENGED TO WORK THAT PHRASE INTO MY CONFIRMATION HEARING BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY WOULD BUY ME UNLIMITED HERE'S- AND IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR DALY ON I DID THAT AND SO I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY. I HOPE SHE GOT SOMETHING FOR THAT. THAT THAT MADE ME THINK OF THE QUESTION SENATOR LAYERED WHAT DID YOU PROMISED HER IF SHE WORKED THAT INTO.

APPROACH AND MESSAGING TO THE HOSPITAL'S CENTER WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OUR SERVICE IN OUR TIME FRAME SINCE YOUR YOUR TIME IN THE ASSEMBLY GOOD AND I KNOW YOU REFERENCE SEISMIC SAFETY AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT THAT STILL MIGHT BE COMING YOUR WAY FROM. OUR HOSPITALS. THEN MAYBE LASTLY IS SECOND QUESTION IS. COULD YOU JUST TALK ABOUT. YOU YOU GET A- APPOINTED AND THEN THE PANDEMIC HAPPENS COULD YOU TALK ABOUT HOW. JEFF THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT S. DON IT IN TERMS OF- BEING REMOTE AND STILL GETTING BUSINESS DONE AND JUST HOW YOU OF SURVIVOR DURING THE PANDEMIC. YES THANK YOU SENATOR SO I CAN'T TAKE CREDIT FOR THE WORK THAT WAS DONE TO MOVE US TO TELEWORK- ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE GOVERNOR- ISSUE THE STATE HOME ORDER BUT LAST MARCH THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED FORTUNATELY WE HAD- PURCHASE LAPTOPS FOR ALL OF OUR STAFF. WELL OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE FIELD STAFF AND HAD TO MAINTAIN THEIR PRESENCE IN THE FIELD AND ACTUALLY HAD IT INCREASED NEED DURING THE HOSPITAL SURGE- IN DECEMBER JANUARY AND FEBRUARY SO WE MAINTAIN FIELD STAFF WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE PROTECTIVE. EQUIPMENT THEY NEEDED TO STAY SAFE BUT- COULDN'T BE PROUDER OF THE JOB THAT THE PHOTO STAFF IS DONE. WORKING REMOTELY AS WITH MOST DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE STAFF THAT HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO HELP WITH CONTACT TRACING AND TESTING AND AS EXPERTS IN HOSPITAL BUILDINGS AND BUILDINGS IN GENERAL I WISH THAT IS NOT A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO SUPPORT THE STATE DURING THE COPA RESPONSE AND SO WE HAVE- WE'VE HELPED HOSPITALS WITH THEIR OXYGEN SUPPLY ISSUES. WE HAVE REVIEWED ALTERNATE CARE SITES THAT HOSPITALS HAVE SET UP AGAIN DURING THE WORST OF THE SURGE BUT THE DAY IN DAY OUT WORK ON THIS HAPPENING IN PEOPLE'S HOMES AS I AM TODAY- AND WE'RE REALLY DOING A GREAT JOB OF MAINTAINING THE MOMENTUM EVEN WITH THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MADAM VICE CHAIR. FOR WOMAN THE VICE CHAIRWOMAN FORGIVE ME. HERE WHATEVER. WITH I DON'T WANT TO BE IN VIOLATION OF SENATOR LAYERED PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE JUST PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE YES BUT NOW I KNOW I CAN AMEND THE WORD WHATEVER INTO IT. REMEMBER MY NAME PAT YOU CAN GO CAIR WOMEN SHARE MAN WHATEVER I THINK THAT WAS A JOKE ON FNL LONG TIME AGO SO I'M GOOD I'M GOOD. ANYWAY- WE HAVE NEED A LITTLE LEVITY AS WE APPROACH SOME OF THESE VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES AND HEALTH CARE AND- I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE- CENTER TRULY OR DUDE OF KIND OF TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON THE SEISMIC ISSUE. AND LET ME BEGIN WITH SAYING I AM SORRY THAT WE DID NOT HAVE TIME YESTERDAY- DIRECTOR LANCE BURKE FOR ME TO HAVE A ON ONE ON ONE WITH YOU AND I'D LIKE TO DO THAT BUT IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE. ONE OF THOSE DAYS- ACTUALLY SO. I DO APOLOGIZE. THAT TUB. JUST QUICKLY ON THE FISA MAKE ISSUE I WITH THE BOARD HOSPITAL BOARD MEMBER AND NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN THE FIRST REQUIREMENT FOR THAT CAME THROUGH. AND WAS FIVE SIGNIFICANTLY YOU KNOW EXTENDED EACH TIME WITH WITH I THINK SOME. REMEDIATION IS REQUIRED BUT I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW SUB. HAVING SPOKEN WITH MY HOSPITALS RECENTLY OF FIGHT TO- I THINK ENSURE THAT OUR SPENDING IN THE ADMINISTRATION ARE WORKING WITH OUR HOSPITALS. AND THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND A SOLUTION IT KIND OF BALANCES THE NEEDS OF THAT IF YOU COULD KIND OF A DRAFT THAT IS YOU'RE GOING FORWARD IF THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT OPPOSITION YOU NOW HAVE. A BECAUSE I THINK ON BOTH SIDES SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE SO THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED. HANDO THAT FALLS IN YOUR LAP I ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW AND IN THE SHORT AND ALL THE LONG TERM ALSO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER BATES AND YES SO- IT IS WITHIN US PETS- RANGE OF DUTIES TO REVIEW SEISMIC STANDARDS AND TO SET THOSE STANDARDS AND WE ARE AWARE OF COURSE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS. HAVE PRESENTED- UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES TO THE HOSPITAL SO WE WERE WE WERE WITH THEM- LITERALLY AS THEY STRUGGLE TO SET UP SPACE DURING THE SEARCHES AND WERE OVERWHELMED SO WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE NOT. HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE BUSINESS AS USUAL OVER THE LAST YEAR I'M AT THE SAME TIME OF COURSE PATIENT SAFETY AND STAFF SAFETY IS CRITICAL. AND SO I'M CURRENTLY THERE IS A TWENTY THIRTY STANDARD AND THEN THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS UNDERWAY TO SEE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- REGARDING THAT TWENTY THIRTY STANDARD AGAIN FINDING THE BALANCE- UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DIFFICULTY HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN UNDER AND ARE ALSO TRYING TO MAINTAIN THAT. THE NEED TO FOCUS ON PATIENT SAFETY. THANK YOU I OUT DOUBT FIVE GIVE I'D WOULDN'T CALL IT GOOD NEWS GREAT NEWS BUT IT'S REALLY THE KIND OF NEWS WE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THEIR SAW CERTAINLY ON. CONTINUING KHAN THE CONVERSATIONS AND CERTAINLY I HAVE A REAL COMMITMENT TO FIND A BALANCE THERE. AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT CERTAINLY- I AM ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND THESE COST HEALTH CARE. COST TARGETS OF CERTAINLY WE'VE LEARNED THAT YOU CAN'T COOKIE CUTTER. OF THE COST OF VARIOUS MEDICAL PROCEDURES. ARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE'VE SEEN GREAT OF. DIVERGENCE IN COSTS FOR DIFFERENT PROCEDURES ESPECIALLY I THINK IN THE ORTHOPEDIC WORLD WHERE. THE REPLACEMENTS AND SOME PARTICULAR HOSPITAL. OUR SYSTEMS ARE AT ONE COSTS AND OTHER THOUGH THERE ARE DIFFERENT COST SO HOW HOW WILL YOU APPROACH. OF THAT WHOLE DISCUSSION OF. TARGET AND- AS IMPORTANTLY IF THE TARGETS AREN'T BEING MET ONCE THEY'RE SET. OUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE RATHER SEVERE PENALTIES. THAT ARE AT LEAST BEING DISCUSSED. THANK YOU CENTER FOR SO YOU WORK. TO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED OFF OF HEALTH FOR. IT WOULD BE PLACED WITHIN OUR HEAD- WE WOULD FOLLOW ON THE HEELS OF SEVERAL OTHER STATES THAT HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN TRYING TO SET COST TARGETS- BUT OF COURSE S ALWAYS VOID. BUT OUR OUR CALIFORNIANS FIN ON IT SO- FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'VE HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS THE NEEDS- TO WAIT IN TERMS OF WHEN THE THAT COST TARGETS WOULD START AND SO WE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT USED CURRENT PANDEMIC DATA AS A BASELINE DATA. WERE LOOKING TO HAVE THE FIRST YEAR OF COST TARGET STARTED TWENTY TWENTY FOUR I KNOW ENFORCEABLE TARGETS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH BUT HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE INCREASING AS COMPARED TO THE RATE OF INFLATION- ITS FIVE TIMES WEEKLY HAD A WEAPON ARE THIS WITH THIS- OVER THE LUNCH PERIOD TODAY AND LOOK AT SOME REALLY STARTLING STATISTICS- SO WE KNOW THAT FAMILIES. ARE REALLY SUFFERING UNDER THE- ANOTHER'S HI HOW CARE COSTS. AS OUR- AND US IS THE STATE IS A LARGE. OF HEALTH COVERAGE SO- IT IS OUR VIEW THAT THE- COSTS ARE INCREASING AT A RATE THAT'S UNSUSTAINABLE- IN TERMS OF SETTING COST TARGETS. WE HAVE APPROACH OF HAVING- I ADVISORY BOARD THAT WOULD SET THE COST TARGETS THAT WOULD BE REVIEWED- BY IT BY MY THE- IBM OR THE DIRECTOR IN MY ROLE. AND IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT WE WOULD VERY MUCH LOOK TO A PROGRESSIVE APPROACH SO THAT THE FIRST THAT PEACE WOULD BE TO DO OUTREACH- TO THE PARTY THAT MAY NOT HAVE MET THE COST TARGETS UNDERSTAND LOOK AT THE DATA. MORE CAREFULLY WITH THEM THERE WOULD BE AN APPEALS PROCESS. AS WELL AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS BEFORE WE GOT ANYWHERE NEAR FINE SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCING BUT. IS A PROGRESSIVE FORCES APPROACH. I APPRECIATE THAT- I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AYE IN THE LEGISLATURE THOUGH THE LAWMAKERS AS YOU GO FORWARD WITH WITH THE PLAN. UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE THE COST DRIVERS AND HAVING A PRETTY COMPLETE PRESENTATION. AND SOME VALIDATION ON COMPARATIVE DATA ON ON WHAT ARE THE COST DRIVERS BECAUSE MANY TIMES IT IS ADDING MORE SERVICES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE COVERED BY OUR HEALTH PLANS. AND I THINK OF HAT IS BEEN ONE OF THE THINGS ARE HAVING ONCE UPON A TIME SERVED ON THAT BOARD WAS BEFORE H. M. O.'S CAME INTO BEING. ONCE THEY DID THE CAPITATION ISSUES ARE BECAME SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF. WHAT IT WAS COSTING FOR- YOU KNOW COVERAGE SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I WOULD LOOK FOR ON IN TERMS OF. PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BASICALLY ARE IMPLEMENTED BOB COSTARRED GOOD FAN PUNISHMENT FROM AND ALL OF THAT. LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS- REGARDING OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. AND I THINK WE'RE ALL CONCERNED BECAUSE CERTAINLY IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT ACCESS WE CERTAINLY HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO PROVIDE US THE SERVICE. SO WHAT DO YOU SEE ARE THE MOST PRESSING HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE ISSUES. FACING THE STATE AND- BOUGHT. FUND ON HOW WE ADDRESS THOSE. THANK YOU. SO AS YOU NOTED THERE AND LOT OF HER. AND COMMISSIONS- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT REALLY DELVED INTO THOSE- THAT IF BUT IF NOTED THAT THE LACK OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. ON THE OTHER SPECIFIC TYPES OF PROVIDERS SO WHEN I GOT TO ASK THE LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS AGO I WAS CHARGED RIGHT AWAY WITH. TRYING TO LOOK AT THOSE REPORTS AND TAKE THE BEST THINKING AND REACH OUT TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND OUT WHAT WE COULD DO TO MOST EFFECTIVELY. MEET THAT THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA SO- WE SPEND TIME WITH THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION REPORT ILLEGAL REPORTS AND OTHERS. AND WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON TRYING TO BUILD THE PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. SO IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC APPROACHES I'M REALLY DOES NEED TO START. ALMOST BEFORE HIGH SCHOOL WE KNOW THAT- IN UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES THERE ARE THE SCIENCE CLASSES THERE IS IN THE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO GET INTO HEALTHCARE- PROFESSIONS AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO FIRST START WITH THOSE PIPELINE PROGRAMS. AND THEN EVERY STEP OF THE WAY HAVE SUPPORTIVE- MENTORS AND OTHER SUPPORT PROGRAMS WITHIN THE COLLEGE SYSTEM AND THEN PROVIDE SCHOLARSHIPS LOAN REPAYMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND FRANKLY CALIFORNIA NEEDS A LOT MORE RESIDENCY PROGRAM SO WE ARE TRYING TO- HIT EVERY EVERY LEVEL OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE LADDER- TO TRY TO MEET THAT NEED- ASHIK HAD HOUSES. THE PRIMARY CARE OFFICE AND SO WE DO. ANALYSIS EVERY YEAR TO SEE WHERE THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS ARE AND TRY TO FOCUS OUR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ARE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS ON THOSE AREAS. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS BEFORE- THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO IMPROVE ON THE STRATEGIC APPROACH THAT WE TAKE. AND TERMS OF TRYING TO BUILD RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND OTHER TYPES OF TRAINING PROGRAMS WE NEED MORE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WE NEED MORE I'M AT EVERY LEVEL. AND FRANKLY- THAT THE NEED IS ALL THE PRESSING RIGHT NOW- THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WORKING AND- OF AND DOWN SO- PROUD. TO HAVE THE OPTION JUST TO- HELP SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS AND WE HAVE A GREAT TEAM ON ON TAP TO TRY TO REALLY. WORK AND BUILD A WORK FORCE THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY OFTEN. IN DEPTH DISCUSSION ON OUT REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE- ON I BELIEVE THAT COVERS MOST F MY QUESTIONS I JUST ASKED GOING FORWARD IF YOU'LL KEEP A- US VERY MUCH IN THE IN THE LOOP ON ESPECIALLY ON THEIR SIDE. BEFORE FORTY BILITY TARGET ISSUE OF BECAUSE OF THAT I'M I'M RELUCTANT. TO MOVE FORWARD- TO SUPPORT TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THAT IF. IF FOR IT WAS STYMIED I GUESS WHEN IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. THAT CREATING- SOMETHING THAT COULD BE A ON ANOTHER BUREAUCRACY THAT ACTUALLY ADDS. A COST BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A NEW EMPLOYEES IN THAT. IS A CONCERN OF MINE AND CERTAINLY ON ENSURING THAT ACROSS THE STATE. WE DON'T HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW THAT. THAT THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS OUT THERE IN THE REAL. YOU KNOW HEALTHCARE PROVIDER WORLD SO WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR ON ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND I WILL- CERTAINLY. DIAL BACK WITH YOU SO WE CAN HAVE MORE IN DEPTH DISCUSSIONS ON A COUPLE OF THESE ITEMS THAT. STILL TROUBLES ME A LITTLE BIT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU- SENATOR I'M. GOING TO MOVE TO SENATOR BREAUX. THANK YOU MADAM. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS I TO- IS LANDSBERG WAS NOT ABLE TO- AND MEET WITH YOU YESTERDAY AND I DO APOLOGIZE. IT'S JUST BEEN LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY SAID. JUST A HECTIC SCHEDULE THROUGH THE MONTH OF APRIL. AND I KNOW WE'RE IN MAY BUT HE HASN'T SLOWED DOWN YET I DON'T THINK. AND I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY SENATOR BATES A VICE YOU'RE ASKED YOU. ABOUT THE ISSUES ON THE- TARGETING- COST STRATEGIES FOR TARGETS OR DEVELOP COST TARGETS IF- HEALTH PLANS DIDN'T MEET. THE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED- YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE GONNA DO THERE WAS OTHER STATES THAT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THIS PROGRAM ALREADY BUT THAT WE WOULD PUT IT CALIFORNIA'S BAN ON IT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. YES SO- THERE ARE NUMBER OF STATES THAT HAVE LOOKED AT AT COST TARGETS I'M NOT ALL OF THEM DO HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM ON AND WE THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. WE ALSO HAVE SPECIFIC PIECES OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SPENDING ENOUGH ON PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE ADEQUATE INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN ORDER TO TRY TO PREVENT CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AND OTHER EXPENSIVE CARE DOWN THE LINE- WE ALSO WANT TO PROMOTE ALTERNATE PAYMENT METHODS. I'M REALLY LOOKING NOW YOU BASED PAYMENTS SO THAT DOCTOR PRACTICES HAVE. THE INVESTMENT THEY NEED- IN TECHNOLOGY- AND CAN HAVE THE INVESTMENTS ON ON CARE MANAGEMENT AND ADDRESSING CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS THOSE ARE SOME OF THE- I THINK IMPORTANT PIECES RELATED TO THAT THE PROPOSED CALIFORNIA. OFFICES WHAT'S YOUR PORTABILITY. THANK YOU IN REGARDING THIS OFFICE- HEALTH CARE. WHAT'S GONNA BE YOUR ROLE IN THAT. SO THE OFFICE IS PROPOSED TO BE WITH AN ARCH THAT INTEL WOULD BE ONE OF THE OFFICES UNDER ME- WE HAVE A PROPOSED ORGANIZATIONAL CHART- WITH THE STAFF GOING ABOVE A HUNDRED I WAS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AND- WE HAVE AN ADVISORY BOARD. THAT'S PROPOSED- AND THE DIRECTOR WOULD OVERSEE A LOT OF THE WORK MAKING SURE THAT THE ADVISORY BOARD HAS WHAT THEY NEED IN TERMS OF THE DATA OUT. OF AUSTIN WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRODUCING A NUMBER OF REPORTS INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING THE COSTS AND THE ISSUE THAT SENATOR BATES RAISES A CRITICAL ONE WE'VE REALLY GOT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY COST DRIVERS IN SO BOTH COLLECTING THE DATA AND THEN DOING MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS IS GOING TO BE. KEY TO TRY TO MEET THAT NEED. SO MEETING WITH MY HOSPITAL PRESIDENTS IN MY HOSPITALS IN THE DISTRICT- 50% OR JUST NORTH OF 50% OF THE COST TO RUN THE HOSPITAL IS A LABOR- ABOUT 1815218% IS- THE DRUG AND PHARMACY. PURCHASES AND THEN ANOTHER 1112% IN EITHER PURCHASED- THE STUFF IT'S REQUIRED. DO YOU THINK IT'S- A FAIR STATEMENT TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THESE COSTS GO UP BECAUSE I MEAN POLICIES THAT GO OUT OF THIS BUILDING I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT POLITICAL I'M SAYING THAT. YOU KNOW POLICIES GO UP RATIO BILLS- ED PLANNING FOR TWENTY THIRTY AND RETROFITTING HAVING TO CITY MANY DECIDE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR THAT SOMEHOW. AND BECAUSE REALLY THEY ARE A BUSINESS I MEAN- YOU KNOW I REALIZE THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE YOU KNOW NON PROFITS AND THEY DO PROVIDE EXCELLENT SERVICE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THESE HOSPITALS ARE NOT REGULATED OR LEGISLATED OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE WE NEED PEOPLE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO CARE- DO YOU. DO YOU FIND THAT POLICIES THAT GO OUT OF THIS BUILDING COULD BE A POSSIBILITY THAT IT'S CAUSING THE COST INCREASES FOR HOSPITAL PAYMENTS. THANK YOU SENATOR BREAUX AS WITH EVERY IN HEALTHCARE I THINK COSTS AND HOSPITAL COSTS ARE COMPLICATED. BUT THE HOT THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY IF IT'S APPROVED- BY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE PIECES SO WOULD HAVE TO HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH ARE LABOR. WAGES INCREASING BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THAT IS A PRIMARY COST OF EVERY HOSPITAL IF THERE WERE A NEW MANDATE- THAT WAS IMPOSED THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE A CONSIDERATION AS WELL SO. THAT THE CONCEPT IS TO SET ONE AN ECONOMIC INDICATOR- AND- AS THE AS THE COST TARGET SO THAT THAT WOULD BE TIED TO. INFLATION TO ECONOMIC CHANGES BUT WE ABSOLUTELY WOULD ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT ANY NEW MANDATES THEIR HOST ON HOSPITALS. OKAY AND THEN THEM. ON THIS OUR OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE ACCOUNTABILITY IT. NUMBER ONE IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE MORE TRANSPARENCY. IN THE PRICE. AND QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE NUMBER TO DEVELOP COST STARGATES IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. NUMBER THREE DEVELOP ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK INCLUDING FINANCIAL PENALTIES. FOR HEALTH CARE ENTITIES THAT DON'T MEET THESE COST TARGETS- WHEN THESE COST TARGETS ARE SET AND THERE'S JUST NOT A REAL WAY ON THE GROUND TO BE ABLE TO MEET THESE TARGETS BASED ON. THE OBLIGATIONS THAT HOSPITALS HAVE ALREADY HAVE IN AND YOU KNOW THAT HOSPITALS ALREADY HAVING. TO MAINTAIN OUR HEALTH PLANS ARE HAVING TO PAY FOR- THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION IS HEALTH. SO IF HEALTH PLANS CAN. REDUCE THE COST TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND THERE ARE TARGETS FIT IN PLACE. AND I GUESS I'M JUST GOING TO ASK YOU POINT BLANK IS THIS A PLANNER POLICY THAT IS MOVING US TO A SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. NO THIS IS NOT MOVED TO A SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THIS TRULY IS ABOUT- TRANSPARENCY UNDERSTANDING THE COST DRIVERS AND SETTING COST TARGET SO- EVERY PART OF THE PROCESS WOULD START WITH TRYING TO WITH CAPTURING DATA ON THE TOTAL COST OF CARE LOOKING AT PREMIUMS LOOKING AT WHAT INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS ARE PAYING AND DEDUCTIBLES- IN COPAYS. LOOKING INTO MINISTRY BECAUSE TAKING THAT TOTAL COST OF CARE AND SETTING A COSTS ARE GOING TO GET IT COULD BE AT THE RATE OF INFLATION IT COULD BE TO THE GDP- AND THEN HAVING THAT APPLY TO- MOST MEMBERS. OF THE HEALTHCARE MARKET BUT THERE'S NOTHING DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE SINGLE PAYER NOW MA'AM. IS THERE A PLAN TO- STREAMLINE THE PROCESS FOR PERMITTING FOR CHANGES OR- BUILDING GOING BACK TO THE BUILDINGS OF HOSPITALS AND- RETROFITTING AND YOU KNOW WINGS BEING ADDED. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S- EVERY OTHER STATE HAS SOME TYPE OF CONCEPTUAL PROCESS FROM BEGINNING TO END. BUT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T AND- THEY DON'T WE DON'T EVEN START WITH A COMPLETE PROCESS BEFORE CONSTRUCTION ON THE PROJECT EVEN GET STARTED AND THEM. IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING FOR A LOT OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TRYING TO MEET THESE NEEDS THE STANDARDS THAT ARE SET OUT OF THIS BUILDING AND ALSO- AND DEAL WITH THE RETROFITTING ISSUE. IT'S GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS A BAD FOR CONSTRUCTION. IN CALIFORNIA VERSES ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MOST MOST OTHER STATES. IN THE HOSPITAL- THE PEOPLE THAT THE HOSPITAL WORK WITH ENGINEERS THOSE KINDS INDIVIDUALS THAT BUILD THESE MEGA SHIPS MAGNIFICENT DISABILITIES- IT'S BECAUSE OF THE DELAY IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS AND THE PROCESS ITSELF IS THERE A- IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE YOUR TEAM LOOK AT THE PROCESS AND HOW IT'S CONTINUALLY DELAYED AND- MAINLY HAVE A- A CONCEPT FROM BEGINNING TO END FOR CONSTRUCTION AND NOT JUST KEEP MOVING IT IF THAT MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW SO IT'S TRUE THAT AUSTIN DOES THAT THE BUILDING STANDARDS- AND THOSE ARE SET IN CODE. AND WE HAVE A HOSPITAL BUILDING SAFETY BOARD WITH MANY MEMBERS OF THE HOSPITAL INDUSTRY AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT PARTICIPATE IN THAT SO THERE ARE STANDARDS. THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE ARE HERE TOO BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN OPTION HAD STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS IN LIFE AND SAFETY FOLKS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEEDS OF THE HOSPITAL ALL. DO A LOT. HAVING AND APPROACHES OF HOW THEY MAY BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR BUILDINGS ALL WITHIN THE CONFINES OF BUILDING STANDARDS CERTAINLY HAPPY TO LOOK AT- AT SPECIFIC APPROACHES BUT- AGAIN MY TEAM HAS MADE A LOT OF STRIDES IN THE LAST DECADE TO INNOVATE TO TRY TO HAVE A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WITH HOSPITALS TO MEET THE SHARED GOAL OF SENATE HAVING THIS HOSPITALS MEET STANDARDS AND MAINTAIN PATIENT SAFETY WHILE ALSO HAVING IN. A PROCESS THAT WORKS FOR ALL PARTIES AND THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK WE ARE THE ISSUES I THINK WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON AND A TIMELY PROCESS I MEAN IT TOOK ALMOST THIRTY YEARS TO BUILD A HOUSE BUT WHEN I HAVE TO HAVE TO BE AREA- AND- IT WAS THE ARE SPREAD PROCESS THAT STOP TO THAT HOSPITAL FROM MOVING FORWARD AFTER TO BONDS AND- IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT AND THAT'S A REAL COMMUNITY IT. HAD- JEFF UNTIL LAST YEAR THE YEAR JUST TWO YEARS AGO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CODE KIND OF THROWS ME OFF SO I APOLOGIZE BUT- JUST RECENTLY THE DAY HAD MOVED FROM A HOSPITAL THAT WERE THEY WERE STILL WILLING OXYGEN BOTTLES DOWN THE HALLWAY AND THEY HAD CONCRETE. AND CINDER BLOCKS WHERE THE NURSES STATION WAS. AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET INTO A STATE OF THE ART FACILITY AND BECAUSE OF THE PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH. WITH US BED SO- WE'RE GOOD WE'VE BUILT OUR HOSPITAL BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER- COMMUNITIES THAT I HEAR FROM THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GOT IT DONE IN YOU KNOW LESS THAN FORTY YEARS IT'S I JUST THINK THAT TIME FRAME. IS SIGNIFICANT I THINK WE CAN BUILD A STATE OF THE ART HOSPITAL. IN A IN A SOONER TIME FRAME THAN THAT SO IF YOU WOULD LOOK AT THAT I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE'LL CERTAINLY DO SO THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU MA'AM SORRY NOT JUST MAKING SURE ARE YOU FINISHED THANK YOU SENATOR GROW- SENATOR COM LOCKER. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM UM AND SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO- CHAT. EARLIER TODAY AND- I SHARED WITH YOU THAT I AM EXCITED ABOUT. YOUR APPOINTMENT IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY IMPLEMENT. BIG BOLD MEASURES AND THOSE ARE THINGS I HANG THAT CALIFORNIA TENDS TO PRIDE ITSELF ON AND SO- WE I THINK WE'LL BE ROOTING FOR THE SUCCESS COMING OUT OF THIS DEPARTMENT WE TALKED ABOUT A FEW THINGS THAT I WANT TO ELEVATE- CLEAN THIS COMMITTEE HEARING IF YOU DON'T MIND. THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS THE- PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING- AND WE KNOW THAT- WITH OSCAR PET DRUG MANUFACTURERS ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY YOU ALL- I GUESS WHEN THEY'RE INTRODUCING A NEW DRUG INTO THE MARKET PLACE OR WHEN THERE'S AN INCREASE IN PRICING- AND- I THINK YOU ALL HAD ISSUED I THINK SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN. ABOUT SIXTY TWO PENALTIES TOTALING OVER SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS BUT HAD ONLY COLLECTED ROUGHLY SIX AND A HALF MILLION- IN FINES. AND JUST WANTED TO KNOW- IF YOU COULD SHARE WHY THE COLLECTIONS- ARE SO LOW ESPECIALLY SINCE WE TALKED ABOUT ENFORCEMENT I WAS LOOKING AT THOSE NUMBERS THINKING WE BETTER GET OUR MONEY. THANK YOU SENATOR AKAKA LAWYER SO- I SAID DOES CONSIDER THE BECAUSE- REASONING FOR LATE SUBMISSIONS SO. IF A DRUG COMPANY HAS AGREED BECAUSE WE DO A SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATION PROCESS WITH THEM TO HEAR ANY SPECIFIC PARTICULAR CONCERNS. OR LACK OF INFORMATION OR- IN THE BEGINNING ADMITTEDLY THERE ARE SOME- TECHNICAL PROBLEMS JUST WAS SUBMITTING SOME OF THE REPORTING SO IF ANY OF THAT'S THE CASE WE HAVE SHOWN LENIENCY- WE ALSO WERE MORE FOCUSED AT THE- BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM AND MAKING SURE THAT THE MANUFACTURERS. UNDERSTOOD OR COMPLYING. WITH THE REQUIREMENTS BUT IT'S BEEN LONG ENOUGH AND IT'S TIME FOR MANUFACTURERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR REPORTING AND NOTICE REQUIREMENTS ARE AND SO WE ARE BEING A LITTLE MORE SERIOUS ABOUT- MAKING SURE WE'RE OR BY GETTING FOR COLLECTING ON THOSE FINES. ON A RECENT APPEAL I DID ISSUE A DECISION SUSTAINING AT TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY AGAINST A PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURER THAT FAIL TO PROVIDE TIMELY REPORTING- AND DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD REASON AND SO WE HOPE THAT- MANUFACTURES WILL BE ON NOTICE THAT WE'RE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY. AND WE DO NEED THEM TO COMPLY. THANK YOU FOR THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL THEM THERE'S A NEW. IN I DIDN'T I NUMBER COLLEAGUES HAVE ASKED ABOUT THE SEISMIC SAFETY ISSUES AND SO I WILL- REALLY BE LABOR THAT BUT AS I MENTIONED WITH YOU I'VE- SEEN A COUPLE OF LETTERS I THINK FROM THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION REALLY ASKING FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH REGARDS TO- THE COMPLIANCE ISSUES BECAUSE OF CODED AND THE COSTS. THAT THEY'VE HAD T- FOR ABSORB- AND SO JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE NEON THE FLEXIBILITY ISSUE WITH COMPLIANCE. AND ALSO WITH REALITY BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW HOSPITALS WHO HAVE- RAKED IN A NUMBER OF PROFITS HAVE HAD A GOOD YEAR AS A RESULT OF LAST YEAR- AND SO I DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT ELEVATE VAST. AND TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR HOSPITALS ARE STAYING IN COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT IS REQUIRED FROM THEM BY THE STATE. THANK YOU SO I MEAN I THINK THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS HAVE REALLY COME A LONG WAY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. I'M IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THERE WERE MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED. THANK YOU HOSPITAL BUILDINGS THAT WERE AT RISK OF COLLAPSE- INTERFACE AND THAT IS DOWN TO ONLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE BUILDINGS- THEY'RE WHAT WE CALL S. PC ONE THAT THE SEISMIC PERFORMANCE CATEGORY ONE. SO HOSPITALS HAVE COME A LONG WAY WORKING WITH AUSTIN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR BUILDINGS ARE SAFE. AND YES WE KNOW THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS PUT AN UNUSUAL STRAIN ON HOSPITALS- BUT THE WORK DOES NEED TO CONTINUE. WE UNDERSTAND THE HOSPITAL SO IT'S THE ISSUE MAY HAVE A PROPOSAL ON IT WILL AS ALWAYS PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- ON THAT PROPOSAL. SO YOU MEANT A HUNDRED AND THEIR HOUSE. IS DO YOU DAHLE GENERALLY WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED- THERE ARE THEY SPRINKLED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TODAY TEND TO BE AND RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE URBAN COMMUNITIES ARE DENSER. DO WE HAVE ANY OF THAT INFORMATION. WE DO HAVE A GEO MAP OF THAT AND- THEY ARE- THEY ARE SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS ONE WOULD EXPECT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP THERE CERTAINLY BLUSTERY YOUR AREA AND IN LOS ANGELES. AS WELL AS IN THE BAY AREA- BUT THERE ARE SOME RURAL HOSPITALS AS WELL AND SO. THOSE HOSPITALS ARE IN AREAS- DO THIS- VARIOUS. PHASES ALONG THE WAY IN TERMS OF SOME OF THEM ARE IN THE PROCESS OF RETROFITTING SOME OF THEM MAY BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. SOME OF THEM MAY BE DECOMMISSIONED- SO. BUT THEY THEY ARE SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHEN WE I BELIEVE. WE'VE SHARED A MAP AND IF NOT WE'LL FOLLOW UP AND ARE HAPPY TO DO SO. I AM SO I. WE DID TALK A- ABOUT OKEH- AND AS I MENTIONED THAT IS BIG AND BOLD. SO THIS IS MY LAST QUESTION WHICH- WE ALSO DISCUSSED IN. GIVEN THE ENORMOUS TASK AHEAD OF YOU- AND THE COMPLEXITY AND ENORMITY OF THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE- AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT. EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS ACCESS TO IT- AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT YEAH I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE A MAGIC WAND TO DO ALL OF THAT BUT YOU ARE IN A REAL POSITION TO HELP MAKE THAT MANIFEST. WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD SHARE- WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT THINKING ABOUT. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AND THE ENORMOUS TASK IN FRONT OF YOU. WELL CERTAINLY MAKING SURE THAT OUR HOSPITALS ARE SAFE ON THE CRITICAL FUNCTION OF OXFORD AND SOMETHING THAT I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY- RIGHT NOW WITH THE- WITH THE COVETED CRISIS AND I THINK REALLY HAS WILL. TAKE A COMBINATION OF THE COVERED CRISIS THE ECONOMIC PAIN THAT FOLKS ARE UNDER AND THEIR RECOGNITION OF OUR COUNTRY'S MANY HUNDRED YEARS A RACIAL INEQUALITY HAS LED TO REALLY A HUGE. SPIKE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO BE LASER FOCUSED AS WE LOOK TO OUR WORK FORCE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HELPING BUILD THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS MAKING SURE THAT PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ARE TRAINED TO DO SCREENING FOR DEPRESSION AND OTHER. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS- MANY TO START A YOUNG OLD WITH WITH CHILDREN AND THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN A LEADER ON THAT SO- HOSPITAL SAFETY THE WORK FORCE THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS THAT THAT REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND THEN VERY EXCITED TO HOPEFULLY DELVE INTO THIS NEW OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WHICH IS ENORMOUSLY COMPLEX- BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STATES THAT HAVE DONE IT WELL- THAT WE ALL LEARN FROM. AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN TRYING TO THE END THIS IS NOT ABOUT CONTROLLING COSTS ONLY WE DON'T WANT TO RACE TO THE BOTTOM WE WANT A HIGH VALUE SYSTEM. THAT MAINTAINS QUALITY HOPEFULLY IMPROVES QUALITY IN EQUITY OVER TIME THROUGH THE INVESTMENTS IN PRIMARY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE- THAT CONTROLS COSTS- THAT WE HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES. AS WELL AS SUPPLIERS AND STATE. WELL YOU KNOW I WANNA THANK YOU- FOR THAT RESPONSE AND FOR ALL OF YOUR WRIST- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU. AS I LISTEN TO YOU IT REMINDS ME THAT HEALTHCARE IS SUCH A PERSONAL ISSUE AND IT REALLY GOES TO THE CORE. OF HOW WE SEE OURSELVES AND HOW WE VALUE OURSELVES. AND HOW ARE COMMUNITIES SEE AND VALUE US. YOU KNOW SO MANY FOLKS- WITH ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS WOMEN ARE FOLKS WHO ARE A POOR FOLKS WHO WERE LIVING IN DIFFERENT YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES IF IT'S RURAL FOLKS ARE LGBT- FOLKS WHO'VE WHO'VE BEEN IN THE MILITARY MAN I MEAN EVERYONE COMES WITH A STORY. ABOUT HOW THEY SEE THEIR BODY. AND HOW THEY TAKE CARE OF IT- AND I REALLY THINK THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT- IS HELPING CALIFORNIA GET TO THE CORE OF HOW WE ANSWER ALL OF THOSE ISSUES. AND QUESTIONS WITH SOME COMPASSION WHILE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T BANKRUPT YOU KNOW THE STATE OR THE PROVIDERS THAT ARE HERE. AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT IF WE HAVE HEALTHY CALIFORNIANS THAT WE HAVE A HEALTHY STATE SO THAT'S I'M GOING TO GET OFF THE SOAPBOX MANNA PRO TEM- BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME- MISS LANDSBERG AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR COM LONGER- I. APPRECIATE THE ROBUST A CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION AND- MISS LANDSBERGER YOUR LAST STATEMENT SEEMED LIKE A COMPILATION AND CONCLUSION OF THE VISION- AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS.
