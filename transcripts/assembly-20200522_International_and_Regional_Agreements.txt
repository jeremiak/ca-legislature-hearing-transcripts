I LEFT WITH THAT LET'S HIT RESET AND- AND START I AM MARC LEVINE AND WELCOME TODAY'S HEARING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL AGREEMENTS. TODAY WE ARE LOOKING INTO THE WESTERN STATES PACKED. WE'RE STARING DOWN THE FACE OF THE GREATEST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. IN A CENTURY LED BY SCIENCE AND DATA BAY AREA PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS INSTITUTED THE FIRST DAY AT HOME ORDERS IN THE NATION. ON MARCH SIXTEENTH. THEIR FEARLESS LEADERSHIP IS SAVING LIVES TO THEM I SAY THANK YOU. DAYS LATER GOVERNOR NEWSOME ESTABLISHED A STATEWIDE STAY AT HOME ORDER ACROSS ALL FIFTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA COUNTIES WHICH EXTENDED THIS LIFESAVING MEASURE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS PRIOR WE SAW THE STEP TAKEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND WE'VE ALSO SENSING THIS REPLICATED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. EVEN LIFESAVING INSTINCTS HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WITH THE BILL TAKING A FAX COVE IN NINETEEN IS TAKING A TOLL. ON HUMAN HEALTH. AND LIVES AND ALSO ON LOCAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES. WE ARE NOW FACE THE DILEMMA OF HOW TO RELAX LIFESAVING MEASURES WHILE BREEDING LIFE BACK INTO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS IN THE NORTHEAST AND ALONG THE WEST COAST ON APRIL THIRTEENTH ANNOUNCED SEPARATE STATE COMPACTS TO COORDINATE ONE OF THEIR BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN THE WEEKS TO COME. HOW TO BEGIN RE OPENING SOCIETY A MIG AMID THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC. THE GOVERNOR IS MADE SEPARATE ANNOUNCEMENTS JUST HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAID ON TWITTER. THAT IT WAS HIS DECISION TO DECIDE WHEN TO OPEN UP THE STATE'S WE KNOW THAT ISN'T THE CASE AND WE KNOW THAT TO DO IT PROPERLY IT WILL TAKE TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THE MULTI STATE COUNCIL INCLUDES CONNECTICUT DELAWARE NEW JERSEY NEW YORK PENNSYLVANIA AND RHODE ISLAND. IN A NEWS RELEASE ON APRIL SIXTEENTH A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF GOVERNORS OF ILLINOIS INDIANA KENTUCKY MICHIGAN MINNESOTA IOWA AND WISCONSIN. ANNOUNCED A MULTI STATE AGREEMENT KNOWN AS THE MIDWESTERN STATES PARTNERSHIP TO DISCUSS RE OPENING THE ECONOMIES OF THEIR STATES TOGETHER. THE RELEASE SAID THAT WHILE THERE THE STATE'S WOULD WORK TOGETHER ON THE PLAN. THEY MAY NOT EACH TAKE THE SAME STEPS TO RE OPEN AT THE SAME TIME. MAINE VERMONT NEW HAMPSHIRE AND HAVE TALKED ABOUT A PARTNERSHIP IN THE SOUTHERN STATES COALITION OF ALABAMA. FLORIDA SOUTH CAROLINA GEORGIA AND TENNESSEE. ALSO FORMED. WE ARE IN THE WESTERN STATES PACKED WHICH INCLUDES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OREGON WASHINGTON COLORADO AND NEVADA. THE PACT RESOLVE TO RE OPEN THEIR RESPECTIVE ECONOMIES BASED ON HEALTH OUTCOMES AND SCIENCE NOT POLITICS. AND ON APRIL FOURTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY GOVERNOR NEWSOME UNVEILED THE SIX CRITICAL INDICATORS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT WOULD BE THE FRAMEWORK FOR GUIDING DECISIONS ON RE OPENING. THESE INDICATORS ARE ONE THE ABILITY TO MONITOR AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGH TESTING CONTACT TRACING ISOLATING AND SUPPORTING THOSE FOR POSITIVE OR EXPOSED. TO THE ABILITY TO PREVENT INFECTION IN PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK FOR MORE SEVERE COVE IN NINETEEN. THREE THE ABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND HEALTH SYSTEMS TO HANDLE SEARCHES FOR. THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP THERAPEUTICS TO MEET THE DEMAND. FIVE THE ABILITY FOR BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE FACILITIES TO SUPPORT PHYSICAL DISTANCING. AND SIXTY ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHEN TO REINSTITUTE CERTAIN MEASURES SUCH AS THE STAY AT HOME ORDERS IF NECESSARY. ON MAY ELEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY THE WESTERN SIX PACK JOINTLY WROTE A LETTER TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUESTING ONE TRILLION DOLLARS FOR STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RESPONDING TO THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SINCE THEN. PRESSURE HAS MOUNTED ON GOVERNOR'S ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO RE OPEN THEIR ECONOMIES WITH PROTESTS OUTSIDE CAPITOL BUILDINGS AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITHIN STATES CALLING FOR REGIONALLY BASED RE OPENING. WITH A SURGE IN UNEMPLOYMENT NEARING GREAT DEPRESSION LEVELS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE PUBLIC IS INFORMED AND ENGAGED ON EVERY ASPECT OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY AFFECT THEIR LIVELIHOODS. AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR FAMILIES. IT WAS MY HOPE THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF THIS STATE ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE WESTERN STATES WOULD BE PRESENT. BUT THEY WILL NOT BE PARTICIPATING. DESPITE THIS COMMITTEES INVITATION. LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IS NOT LIMITED IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN FACT THIS ADMINISTRATION'S DEMONSTRATED THAT A FULLY ENGAGED GOVERNMENT IS NEEDED AS MUCH AS EVER THE ADAGE THAT IF YOU WANT TO GO FAST GO ALONE. BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR GO TOGETHER RINGS TRUE THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD DO WELL TO REMEMBER THAT. AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME REMARKS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. MS BOERNER HORVATH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOOKING FOR MEANING THAT HEARING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT HOW THE WESTERN STATES ARE COORDINATING ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY HOW ARE WE GOING TO COORDINATE ECONOMIC RECOVERY SO IT'S NOT JUST DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR RECOVERY AFTERWARDS WE KNOW THAT OUR ECONOMIES OF THE WESTERN STATES ARE. INTRINSICALLY INTERTWINED AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING- THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN THE SAME WAY TO PREVENT A SECOND SEARCH OF THIS VIRUS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THANK YOU FOR GIVING HERE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TESTIMONY IS THAT WE'RE GONNA HERE TAKING HIS BROTHER ARE A MISS COME UNDER. THANK YOU. CHAIR THANK YOU CHAIR FOR THIS SELECT. INCREDIBLY TIMELY ESPECIALLY AS WE ALL BEGIN TO LOOK AT RE OPENING THE STATE AND WHAT IT MEANS. I ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM ENCINITAS THAT- COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS AND AGREEMENTS- ON THIS SIDE OF THE COASTER ON THIS COAST IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. WE BENEFIT FROM- GREAT TOURISM DOLLARS- AND INTEREST FROM SO MANY FOLKS AROUND THE WORLD- WHO WANT TO COME TO ALL OF OUR STATES BUT PARTICULARLY TO CALIFORNIA AND SO HOW WE FOR THE RED. THIS NEEDLE AROUND KEEPING OUR CONSTITUENTS SAFE AND RESUSCITATING OUR ECONOMIES IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE INFORMATION THAT WILL BE SURE TODAY ON THAT. THANK YOU MISS KAMLAGER MR AS ERIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND IT IS VERY TIMELY ECHOING THE COMMENTS OF MY TWO PREVIOUS COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE- IDEA. WHAT I PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS HEARING IS THAT GIVEN THE TOTAL COMPLETE FAILURE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE. AND FORCING FIFTY STATES TO COME UP WITH FIFTY DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS. IT'S BEEN I THINK A VERY WELCOMED ASSESSMENT AND APPROACH BY THE WESTERN STATES TO GET TOGETHER AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY CAN LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER AND BENEFIT FROM- ECONOMIES OF SCALE MISTAKES BEST PRACTICES AND EVERYTHING THAT. THAT BRING STRENGTH IN NUMBERS AND- IN DOING THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET A FEW THINGS WRONG. AND SO HEARINGS LIKE THIS ALLOW FOR US TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S WORKED WHAT HASN'T WORKED AND- WATER ASSESSMENTS AND EVALUATIONS ARE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER NAZARIAN SO. AS STATED EARLIER WELL UNFORTUNATELY THE ADMINISTRATION IS UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE TODAY THE GOVERNOR'S LEGISLATIVE SECRETARY ANTHONY WILLIAMS. DID SUBMIT A LETTER DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF THE ONGOING COLLABORATION BETWEEN. THE FIVE STATES I ALSO HAD A VERY PLEASANT MEETING WITH THAT MR WILLIAMS AND MISS AND ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ABOUT THE ON GOING WORK OF THE WESTERN STATES PACKED. AND I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND ALSO THE ATTENTION THAT THEY ARE PUTTING TO- PROTECTING LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON PROTECTING AND SAVING THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS CALIFORNIA IS A MASSIVE STATE. WE ARE FORTY MILLION STRONG WITH FIFTY EIGHT VERY DIFFERENT COUNTIES. SOME SAY IT IS ON GOVERNOR BOWL. EVEN IN GOOD TIMES AND THE PANDEMIC COMPLICATES THAT REALITY. AS DESCRIBED EARLIER GOVERNORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN PARTISAN LINES HAVE SOUGHT ALLIANCES. TO PLAN OUR WAY THROUGH THE PANDEMIC IN A GRADUAL OPENING OF OUR ECONOMIES SOME OF THE PARTNERSHIPS LIKE THE MULTI STATE COUNCIL. HAVE ENGAGE IN PROCUREMENT PRACTICES TOGETHER. PROCUREMENT SPECIFICALLY OF PP IS- PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT IS A SUBJECT THAT GOVERNMENTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH ACROSS THE GLOBE. IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS PRESENT TODAY WE'D BE ABLE TO ASK ABOUT- THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS ON HOW THEY ARE PRE CURRYING. AT PP- AND DOING IT INDEPENDENTLY OF COURSE AS A STATE OF FORTY MILLION WHILE- THE MULTI STATE COUNCIL IS WORKING TOGETHER TO COORDINATE- PROCUREMENT AND EVEN MANUFACTURING AND I THINK THAT COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS IS ONE. THAT WILL BE MISSED- DIRECTLY ENGAGING THE ADMINISTRATION BUT WE HAVE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE ABLE TO TALK TO US ABOUT THOSE CHALLENGES. AND ALSO- WHY CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUE IN THE WAY THAT WE- EXPERIENCE THE PANDEMIC AND HOW WE HAVE TO APPROACH THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE BEFORE US. WE ALSO ARE MISSING OPPORTUNITIES TO SHARE- THE INFORMATION WE HAVE ABOUT HOW OUR PARTNERS ARE DEALING WITH. THE SPREAD OF COVERED NINETEEN. IN NURSING FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE'S ENGAGED IN THE PACKED AND WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS LEARNED OF THAT TO PROTECT. OUR SENIORS AND THE ELDERLY IN NURSING FACILITIES. FROM CODE NINETEEN. WE ALSO- AS WE ARE PUSH MEMORIAL DAY. I HAVE A LOOSENING OF RESTRICTIONS THAT COMES JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THE- LOOSENING OF MAY FOURTH AND WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE. IN INFECTIONS SINCE THAT TIME. PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- THAT SHOULD HELP INFORM THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MAKING TODAY- GOING FORWARD. SO AT THIS TIME- I WILL BE INVITING THE PANELISTS TO COME UP AND- AND GIVE PRESENTATIONS AND SO- GOOD- WE DO HAVE OUR FIRST PANELIST WHO IS HERE IN PERSON- MISTER JAIME JOHANNSEN PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION. AND WHAT I WILL- ADVISE YOU AS AS I WILL ADVISE THOSE FOR JOINING BY TELEPHONE. WHEN I ASKED THE MODERATOR TO- TO BRING THEM ON TO INTO THE MEETING- WILL BE TO YOU KNOW PLEASE. INTRODUCE YOURSELF OF COURSE TALK TO US ABOUT HOW YOUR ORGANIZATION IS DEALING WITH THIS FOR YOUR MEMBERS AND THIS PART OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU MISTER HANSON. WELL THANK YOU CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TALK- I'M JAMIE JOHANNSON PRESENT A CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU WE REPRESENT OVER THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS GENERAL AG ORGANIZATION SO WE REPRESENT EVERYONE FROM DAIRY FARMERS TO- WINE GRAPE GROWERS TALL A FARMER SUCH AS MYSELF AND CITRUS GROWERS UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA. FIFTY THREE COUNTY FARM BUREAU'S FROM PERIL UP TO MODOC SO- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE ON. THE MARCH SIXTEENTH MAR SEVENTEENTH. HOW BUSY WE BEEN GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO OUR MEMBERS OF WHAT. THEY HAD TO DO WE START BY SAYING ONE OF THE GREAT. WHAT A REALLY IMPORTANT ACTION AND IT WAS- IT HELPED OUR MEMBERS WHO WAS THE INTERPRETATION ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURE BEING A PART OF THAT. CALIFORNIA WAS VERY LIBERAL IN HOW THEY DID IT- MEANING ALL OF AGRICULTURE INCLUDING OUR NURSERIES AND HORTICULTURAL'S SOME STATES THAT WAS NOT THE CASE BUT IN CALIFORNIA. ALL OF AGRICULTURE WAS ABLE TO REMAIN OPEN- AND THAT HELPED GREATLY THE NEXT QUESTION WAS HOW DO WE KEEP OUR EMPLOYEE SAFE IN OUR FAMILIES- SO- WE BEGIN THOSE IMPLEMENTATIONS MONTEREY COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE TOOK THE INITIATIVE. EXCUSE ME. I TOOK THE INITIATIVE AND- CAME UP WITH THEIR OWN PARAMETERS OF HOW TO KEEP EMPLOYEES SAFE VOLUNTARILY WORKING WITH THE COUNTY AS WELL AS MONTEREY COUNTY FARM BUREAU AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL GROUPS- SOON ADOPTED VOLUNTARILY AROUND THE STATE I KNOW WE KEPT UP TO DATE ON OUR SITE- ALMOST WEEKLY UPDATES OF WHAT WE CAN DO. TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS BEYOND WHAT THE REGULATIONS WERE- A TERMS OF SEPARATION BOTH IN OUR PROCESSING PLANTS IN THE FIELD AND ALSO HONOR TRACTORS AND- PLANTERS. WITH I THINK GREAT SUCCESS WE DID NOT SEE THE OUTBREAK OF COVERT NINETEEN AMONGST OUR WORKERS LIKE THIS THE VERY- UPSETTING STORIES THAT WE SEE IN SOME OF OUR- MIDWEST STATES- THERE BUT THAT REALLY IS THE INITIATIVE TAKEN BY CALIFORNIA FARMERS AND RANCHERS. WE SOON CAME OUT WITH A POLL AFTERWARDS- SO THIS THIS POLL IS ABOUT THREE WEEKS OLD FOUR WEEKS OLD WE PLANET UPDATING IN TERMS OF GETTING. A FEELING OF HOW OUR MEMBERS ARE BEING AFFECTED AND HOW THEY'RE DEALING WITH IT- AND MAKE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THERE IS VERY LITTLE THAT. WILL BE VERY FEW IN AGRICULTURE WHO WILL UNTOUCHED BY THIS PANDEMIC. WE'VE HAD A GENERATIONAL EVENT THE GENERATIONAL EVENT THAT WILL BRING ABOUT SOME CHANGES AND IT WILL ALSO BRING ABOUT CHANGES IN HOW WE DO OUR BUSINESS WE UNDERSTAND THAT BUT HOW DO WE DO THAT EFFECTIVELY. BECAUSE ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE COMING OUT OF THIS IS FURTHER CONSOLIDATION IN TERMS OF- EITHER NEW REGULATIONS OR JUST HOW WE DO BUSINESS AND THEN OF COURSE. THE MOST UP SETTING AS OUR CUSTOMERS OVERNIGHT WE WOKE UP AT 50% OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WERE BUSINESSES WERE PUT ON HOLD. 50% OF WHAT WE GROW IN AGRICULTURE GENERALLY GOES TO- CAN SUIT THAT GOES TO RESTAURANTS AND FOOD SERVICES. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DAIRY INDUSTRY AND WE'RE SEEING GEHRY PRICES NOW WE MEASURE AND HUNDRED WAIT. TEN DOLLAR AT YOU KNOW ELEVEN DOLLAR TEN DOLLAR HUNDRED WAIT UP PRICES THAT'S UNHEARD OF. COMING FROM SIXTEEN TO SEVENTEEN JUST DAYS BEFORE. BUT FOR THE DURING SHE FOR EXAMPLE THE SHUT DOWN OF THE SCHOOLS WAS DRAMATIC THE LARGEST CONSUMER FLUID MILK. IN THE UNITED STATES IS OUR IS OUR SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM IN OUR BREAKFAST PROGRAM. CELLS IMMEDIATE HIDDEN OF COURSE IN THEIR INDUSTRY 60% OF CHEESE GENERALLY ENDS UP INTO A FOOD SERVICE. SO JUST JUST ONE OF THE EXAMPLES AND OF COURSE YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND POULTRY AS WELL. WHAT IS WE ASK. OUR CUT AS OUR MEMBERS WAS HAVE YOU LOST CUSTOMERS OUR SALES AND LIKE I SAID EVERYONE WILL BE TOUCHED BY THIS REMEMBER THIS IS THREE WEEKS AGO. WE ARE COMING INTO THE HIGH SEASON APARTMENTS IN THE HIGH SEASON OF SALES. AS WE MOVE INTO THE SUMMER SPRING AND SUMMER MONTHS WITH STONE FRUIT COMING ON AND CULMINATING IN THE FALL WHEN WE'RE PEAK HARVEST WITH FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND- SEASONAL WORKERS EMPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW OUR AROUND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. WE ASKED OUR MEMBERS HAVE YOU LOST CUSTOMERS ARE STILL 57% SAID YES- OF THOSE CUSTOMERS BECAUSE OF A CLOSED THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS FOR THOSE BUSINESSES. AND THEN OF COURSE ONE THING TO REMEMBER IS THE IMPACT WE HAD IN OUR FARMERS MARKETS THERE ARE SOME. THERE ARE SOME CONFUSION TRANSIT THEY WORK IF THEY COULD STAY OPEN AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WE WORKED AROUND THAT WITH THE STATE. THANK YOU TO SECRETARY RAWSON CFA. NOW THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO OPEN IN PARAMETERS AND CHANGING THEIR ADAPTING ON THE FLIGHT HOW THEY SERVE THE CUSTOMERS BUT AT FIRST. THE IMPACT WAS 21% OF OUR MEMBERS HAD LOST SALES. DIRECT CONSUMER SALES JUST BECAUSE THE UNEASINESS THE CONSUMER FELT. TO COME OUT AND TO PURCHASE THAT. AS OF AS SOMEONE WHO PARTICIPATED FOR MANY YEARS IN A FARMER'S MARKET THAT'S A DEVASTATING BLOW. AND FOR ALL OF US THAT ARE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED FARMS CASH FLOW IS IMPORTANT AND EVERY WEEK MATTERS. SO WE KNOW THAT THAT THEY WERE STRUGGLING OUT THERE THE OTHER WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE. IS THAT AROUND A THIRD 240% OF OUR MEMBERS ARE FARMERS. FARMS DEPEND ON OFF FARM INCOME. A SPOUSE OR PARTNER. THAT HAS A JOB OFF THE FORM NOT IS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH WITH AGRICULTURE. SO YES THAT QUESTION. AS YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY LOST OFF FARM INCOME THE QUESTION WAS 42% SAID YES. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT WAS THAT ABOUT 60% OF COURSE WAS THE UNAVAILABLE. UNAVAILABLE JOB DUE TO SHUT DOWN ORDERS. BUT AS WITH EVERYONE ELSE THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT. HAD COULDN'T GO TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DAY CARE AND THE CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS IN THE IMPACT ON OUR CHILDREN HAVE TO STAY HOME. WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WORKED ON AGRICULTURE TO ASSURE EVEN OUR WORKERS. AS WE ASK THEM THE FIRST RULE IF YOU FEEL SICK DON'T COME TO WORK- AND WORK IN THOSE PARAMETERS AND ALSO. WORKING WITH RECENT LEGISLATION AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OF THE NEEDY. STILL. I PAID TO STAY HOME TO TAKE CARE OF A CHILD. WHO WAS IN A TO GO TO. OR TO. SO THERE THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WERE PUT IN THE- UNLESS FEW MONTHS AS WELL. AT REALLY THE BIGGEST ONE HAVE YOU HAD TO CEASE ANY OPERATION 76% SAID NO. AND THEN HAVE YOU BEEN PREVENTED FROM UNDERTAKING AND THIS IS THIS IS THE- INTERESTING ONES WOULD EXPECT. HAVE YOU BEEN PREVENTED FROM UNDERTAKING AB NOR ANY AT ANY NORMAL PLANTING CULTIVATION CROP CARE DUE TO LACK OF PP EASE. OF COURSE THE THIRD SAID YES THEY WERE UNABLE TO THEY HAD TO PUT OFF WORK BECAUSE OF. CERTAIN JOBS THAT WE DO REQUIRE CERTAIN. PP TO BE PROVIDED OF COURSE 66% OF THAT WAS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF THE AN NINETY FIVE MASS- THAT WE ON THE WITH THE SHORTAGE OF. AS WELL AS AND SIXTY SIX ARE SORRY 27% BECAUSE OF THE PROPER GLOVES WEREN'T AVAILABLE. PP IS A BIG DEAL FOR AGRICULTURE GOING FORWARD WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN TERMS OF AVAILABILITY. THERE IS SOME CONFUSION IN TERMS OF THE AN NINETY FIVE MASK AND ALSO THE KC NINETY FIVE THE END NINETY FIVE IS THE APPROPRIATE. THE MASS THAT IS APPROVED TO- PREVENT THE SPREAD OF KOBE OR ALSO IN TERMS OF PARTICULAR MATTERS THAT WE DEAL WITH ON THE FARM AS REGULATED BY CAL OSHA- BUT- THERE IS SOME CONFUSION IF THE K. NINETY FIVE COULD QUALIFY ACTORS EVEN CONFUSION OF KATE. THE CAN NINETY FIVE. IS AN APPROPRIATE MASS TO WEAR IN PLACE OF AN AND NINETY FIVE. JUST ON FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS KIND OF SOME CONFLICTING INFORMATION THEY ARE GETTING A- A COHESIVE. RULING SOMETHING WE'RE FINDING AS WELL ON AGRICULTURE. IS THAT AS WE DEAL WITH THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE REQUIRED TO DO. AT TIMES THEY ARE UNEQUALLY APPLIED ACROSS THE STATE SOMETIMES. A REGULATOR HAS A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION THE SOUTH AND THEY DO IN THE NORTH. SO THERE IS SOME CONFUSION AND OF COURSE PANIC- IN TERMS OF WHAT. HOW DO WE STAY COMPLIANT THE LAST THING WE NEED AT THIS TIME IS A FINE- BUT- SO THAT SOMETHING GOING FORWARD THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO- HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE- MAKE THAT MORE CONSISTENT- AND OF COURSE. ONE THING WE'RE PROUD OF IT AND- WAS THAT 75% OF OUR RESPONDENTS SAID THEY AVOIDED- FOR LOWING ARE LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES. AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER CONSIDERED THE CIRCUMSTANCES- OVERALL. ONE OF THINGS AND ALL KIND OF CONCLUDE HERE AND WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. BUT AS WE GO IN NOW AND WE LOOK AND SEE THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY JOB THAT OUR CULTURES AND IS IT. ADAPTING TO THE SITUATION BEFORE US. IS CONCERNED IS CALIFORNIA OPENS UP. HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO PROTECT OUR EMPLOYEES IN THE AND WHAT HOW WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY. MINIMIZED THE IMPACT ON OUR FARMS FROM THIS COVERT NINETEEN AS CALIFORNIA OPENS UP AND I KNOW STATE A CALIFORNIA- SACRAMENTO COUNTY- BEGINS. THEIR FACE TO I BELIEVE BEGIN TOMORROW I ACTUALLY FARMING VIEW COUNTY. SO WE ARE A FEW DAYS AHEAD OF AHEAD OF THEIR- BUT AS- OUR EMPLOYEES LEAVE A VERY CONTAINED- ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT WE CAN CONTROL WHO COMES AND GOES- AND NOW BEGIN TO PARTICIPATE IN NORMAL ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE- THE LIABILITIES OF WHAT IS IT EFFORT A PULLEY. CONTACTS COVERT NINETEEN OFF THE FARM HOW DO WE HOW DO WE HOW DO WE PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO BE A REALITY THEY WILL BE MORE ACTIVE HE'S GOING OFF OFF THE FARM AFTER WORK HOURS AS- A CALIFORNIA OPENS UP DURING THESE DIFFERENT PHASES SO THAT'S A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE- IN TERMS OF RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT WERE MADE- APPRECIATE SOME OF THE COMMUNICATION BE ABLE TO HAVE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEM BUT THAT IS A CONCERN GOING FORWARD THAT. THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED I'LL SAY THIS IS JUST AND RIGHT HERE AS WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET BEFORE US AS WE LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES BOTH NATIONALLY AND STATEWIDE- IN TERMS OF BUDGET IN THE EXPENSES WE HAD TO TAKE TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS- IS. THINGS WE LOOK AT THAT CAN BRING ECONOMY BACK IN A BUDGET BACK AROUND- IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT. AND INVESTMENT IN THE RECOVERY OF OUR ECONOMY WILL EITHER BE CONSUMPTION LET. ITS OPENING BACK UP OUR RESTAURANTS ARE THEATERS. ARE SPORTING EVENTS- ILLEGAL BE EXPORT LED. SO WHAT WE HOPEFULLY OUR TRADING PARTNERS HALF OF WHAT WE PRODUCE IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY FIVE. PERCENT CALIFORNIA TO GO TO AN EXPORT MARKET- SO. THAT WE EXPORT A LOT OF GOODS WELL OUR NAY WELL OUR PARTNERS STAY OPEN THE EUROPEAN UNION OUR LARGEST TRADING PARTNER THAN CANADA. AND OF COURSE MEXICO. AND THEN OF COURSE INVESTMENT. SOUL PEOPLE INVESTING CALIFORNIA AS WE BEGIN THIS RECOVERY. AND OF COURSE AGRICULTURE WE'RE PROUD TO SAY STANDS READY. TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THREE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF OUR EXPORT. AND OUR OWN PERSONAL INVESTMENT THAT WE MAKE. AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKING CALIFORNIA TO GROW OUR BUSINESSES. SO THAT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. AND CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER JOHANNSEN I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR OPENING COMMENTS PLEASE STICK AROUND CA BECAUSE WILL ASK QUESTIONS BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO. SPEND THE NEXT HOUR ASKING YOU QUESTIONS AND NOT LEAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR EVERYONE ELSE WHO ALSO IS- INVITED- PRESENTS WILL GO THROUGH THE- PANELISTS BEFORE WE THEN. APPROACH THE QUESTIONS. AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO THE PHONE MODERATOR. WHO I AM GOING TO ASK TO PUT ON THE LINE. SERRA FLOCKS WHO IS THE POLICY COORDINATOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION THANK YOU PHONE MODERATOR. AIRLINE US OPEN. HELLO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GOOD MORNING MISS FOX THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT THE INVITATION AND FOR ALL THE HELP FROM YOUR STAFF- MY NAME IS SERRA FLOCKS AND FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. WE REPRESENT TWO MILLION UNION MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA THOSE MEMBERS WORK IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR AND ACROSS MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES INCLUDING THE BUILDING TRADES. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE WERE SENT BY STAFF BUT I WANTED TO ACTUALLY START WITH- WAS ABOUT THE WESTERN STATE PACKED AND WHETHER IT'S LANDING STABILITY. I WOULD SAY THAT THE WESTERN STATES PACKED IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND A REALLY GREAT MODEL BUSINESSES ACROSS STATE BOUNDARIES WHICH MEANS THAT UNIONS DO. WE HAVE WESTERN STATE COUNCILS THAT ARE MORE THAN JUST CALIFORNIA SO HAVING COORDINATION WITH NEIGHBORING STATES MAKES IT EASIER TO BE. RE OPENING IT ALSO PROVIDES A MODEL FOR FUTURE COLLABORATION IN TERMS THAT FOR EXAMPLE PAUL PURCHASING OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WERE JUDGED ONGOING COLLABORATIONS SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO SPEAK AT THIS HEARING AND- VERY HEARTENED BY THE WORK THE GOVERNOR'S ARE DOING IN TERMS OF THE WESTERN STATES. SO WE'RE GOING ON TO THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT THE PANDEMIC AND THAT THE ECONOMIC CRISIS ON OUR OUR MEMBERS. WE'VE BEEN AFFECTED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS FIRST OF COURSE HEALTHCARE WORKERS HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS PANDEMIC FROM THE BEGINNING AND HAVE BEEN VERY DISHEARTENED BY THE LACK OF PP THE LACK OF A STOCKPILE HAVING EXPIRED AND NINETY FIVE MASK. HAVING TO FASHION THEIR OWN MASS- AND REACHING MANY OF THEM CONTRACT ILLNESS AND UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY TO DO TO IT- WE'RE VERY HEARTENED BY THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON TO HELP WORKERS COMP PRESUMPTION- BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION FOR. ALL OF THE WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINE ESPECIALLY HEALTHCARE WORKERS- WE ALSO REPRESENT OTHER ESSENTIAL WORKERS- SEARCHES IN GROCERY FOOD SERVICE. BACK CHILD CARE NURSING HOMES WHICH ARE REALLY. I WOULD SAY MORE THAN A CENTURY WORKERS THE REALLY ARE SACRIFICIAL WORKERS THERE THE ONE TO GO TO WORK AND JUST DELIVER THE FOOD AND STOCK THE GROCERY STORE SHELVES SO THAT ALL OF US CAN SHELTER IN PLACE THESE ARE OFTEN WORKERS THAT ARE THE LOWEST PAID. WITH NO BENEFITS LACKING PP FACING RETALIATION FOR SPEAKING UP SOME OF THEM AREN'T EVEN WORKERS THEY'VE BEEN MIS CLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS- AND JUST DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE RIGHT EVEN TO HAVE. PP PROVIDED BY THEIR EMPLOYERS- AND SO. ARE REALLY THE SUFFERING- AND EXPOSING A LOT OF DAY INEQUITIES THAT ARE BUILT INTO OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF WORKERS WHO ARE DEEMED NONESSENTIAL DAY ARE FACING THEIR OWN WORLD OF ECONOMIC HER AND MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN LAID OFF FOR FURLOUGHED- ARE STRUGGLING TO GET UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE- AN EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE- A LOT OF THE MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO GET UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE LIKELY NOW HAVE THE KEY WAY- BUT REALLY ARE OURS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SURVIVE. WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THE ECONOMY TO RE OPEN AND BE SEEING IN SECURITY OF KNOWING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AS THE ECONOMY VERY SLOWLY WE OPEN BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE LEARNING THAT THE OPENING MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A LOT MORE CHALLENGING THAN. THE ORIGINAL LOCKED DOWN- AND I THINK THE BUDGET THAT BUDGET SUB FOR HEARINGS YESTERDAY SHOWED HOW TRULY STRAINED OUR SAFETY NET IS- AND HOW NEGLECT HAS REALLY LACKED IN A PLACE WHERE IT'S NOT IN A POSITION TO RESPOND TO A MAJOR ECONOMIC CRISIS ARE. SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT MAJOR REFORMS TO OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM SUCH AS RAISING THE TAXABLE WAGE PAGE INCREASING THE LEVEL OF BENEFITS MAKING SURE WE HAVE SOME STUDY FUNDING SO THE NEXT TIME THAT HIT WE DON'T HAVE TO BORROW EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- EXPANDING THE WORKS YEAR PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN KEEP WORKERS CAN. ENACTED TO THEIR JOBS AND THAT THE PARTIAL. YOU WHY PROGRAM. TO GO ON TO BE OPENING AND OF OUR- AROUND RE OPEN. I THINK THERE IS THERE'S THREE AL. AND FIRST ONE AND THE ONE THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE RIGHT NOW MOST CONCERNED ABOUT. IS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF BOTH WORKERS AND CUSTOMERS AS WE START TO SEE BUSINESS RE OPENED- AND SO I THINK. OUR NUMBER ONE CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ENFORCEABLE OPEN GUIDELINES DAD. TO PROTECT WORKERS AND HOUSE. AND GENERALLY WHEN WE COME TO THE LEGISLATURE WE ASK FOR THINGS- LAWS THAT IT BE THREE SENATE MINIMUM LIKE THE MINIMUM WAGE MINIMUM NUMBER EXPECT CLEAT SO WE CAN START TO FLOOR. THAT WE CAN BAND HAVE OTHER EMPLOYERS GO UP FROM. IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS A FLOOR IS NOT A KNOCKED THAT HAVE TO BE THE GOLD. BECAUSE WORKERS LIFE AND- PUBLIC LIVES ARE AT RISK WE CAN'T. JUST WE CAN'T AFFORD TO. WITH NO HAVING. THAT SCIENTIFIC. BASED YEAH APPROPRIATE THEN FLED TO THE SITUATION. AND ALSO WE'RE GOING TO THE A CON AT RISK BECAUSE IF HAVE THIS WAVE AND HALF TO WREAK. IT STONE GONNA DEPEND THAT THE REST. SO IN TERMS OF HAVING IT STANDARD WE REALLY NEED TO MAY SURE THE CALLOW HAS ALL THE- INSPECTORS THAT THEY NEED. AT THAT DOES A- OFFER HAVE THE POWER PP WE CAN X. OUR- STATE WORKERS TO IN AND IT'S DANGER WORK. IT DATA HAVE THE PROTECTION YOU NEED KEEP UP SAFE ALONG THOSE LINES WE NEED BUT PROTECT. AS WE OPEN FOR WORKERS WHO WANT TO REFUSE UNSAFE WORK OR REFUSE WERE BECAUSE THEY ARE AT AND SO WAY AND MANY OF OUR- ARE AND YOU KNOW COME FROM. CAN'T JUSTIFY. THEY HAVE ASKED MY DAD. OTHER ON CAN. WE NEED TO MAKE THAT EVEN IF WORK PLACES ARE SAFE IF IT DOES WRKERS FEEL LIKE. CAN'T GO TO WAR. THAT DAY HAVE A TO KEEP THEIR ON. INSURANCE OR HAVE OTHER KINDS JUST. BACK AT ME TO NEXT POINT WHERE IT'S MAKING SURE. WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE NET TO GET WORKERS. THROUGH THE BE OPEN. WINDOWS THIS IS GONNA BE. FLOWER CON SAY THAT IT'S GOING TO BE WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST. BRING BACK TO OUR PRE PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT AND- ECONOMIC ACTIVITY- SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE INCOME SUPPORT IN PLACE TO WORKERS SO THEY CAN GET THROUGH THIS- THAT AGAIN YOU Y. BENEFITS- SOME MORE AND INCREASE CASH GRANTS FOR. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHICH ARE LOCKED OUT OF BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL AID PROGRAMS AND THEN AGAIN THE WORK SHARE PROGRAMS AND THE U. Y. SO. THE WAY FOR EMPLOYERS TO KEEP WORKERS ON THE JOB MAYBE NOT AT FULL SALARY BUT THAT THERE MADE WHOLE AGAIN. THAT INCLUDES FIGURING OUT WAYS THAT WE CAN KEEP WORKERS' EITHER ON THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE OR HAVE INCREASED SUBSIDIES SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP HELL HEALTH COVERAGE OR EXPAND. ELIGIBILITY FOR THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IS THE WORST TIME TO TAKE WAY PEOPLE HEALTH BENEFITS. ALL WHY WOULD THAT WE WASTE KEEP WORKER CONNECTED THEIR JOB IF WANT TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE CONNIE BACK IN THE BACK TO WAY AND SO WE HAD WE START RIO. THE BUSINESS ARE BACK TO PRODUCTIVITY AND WERE REALLY ABLE TO JUMP START THE ECONOMY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE RECALL AND ATTENTION PROTECTIONS. THAT WORKERS STAY CONNECTED TO THEIR JOBS AND THAT THE MOST EXPERIENCED AND SKILLED WORKERS ARE CALLED BACK- AN EMPLOYER STATE ON TRAINING COSTS. AND WORKERS ARE BACK AT THE SAME CHAO SO THEY CAN TURN AROUND AND WE AND THAT MONEY IN THE ECONOMY. AND THEN ALSO I THINK WE NEED TO START RE OPENING WITH AN EYE TO THE ECONOMY THAT WE WANT TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT PERHAPS. MORE ABLE TO SUSTAIN A PANDEMIC OR A NATURAL DISASTER OR- AND ECONOMIC RECESSION WHICH WE HAD A FEELING WITH COMING IT JUST CAME A LOT SOONER AND MORE DRASTICALLY THAN EXPECTED- SO FIRST. I THINK THE BEST IN ITS BACK CONDIMENTS THAT 42% OF JOBS THAT ARE LOCKED OR NOT COMING BACK. AND SO WHERE CAN WE- TAKE PEOPLE AND PT THEM WHAT KIND OF NEW JOBS DO WE NEED HOW DO WE REACH TRAIN AND DEPLOY WORKERS INTO THE SECTOR AND MAKE SURE THAT. THE WAGES ARE AT A LEVEL THAT MAKE THEM ATTRACTIVE- DO WE NEED TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH OR SANITATION CORPS. DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT SHORING UP THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY THE CARE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF CHILD ELDER NURSING HOME CARE- AND HOW DO WE DO THAT AND SO. I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY AS WE RE OPEN AND START TO SEE WHAT THE HOLD THAT OUR ECONOMY ARE. THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT. WHERE IS OUR TAX DOLLARS BEST INVESTED- TO START EATING. DEVELOPMENT IN CERTAIN AREAS WHERE DO WE NEED TO BE TRAINING- HOW DO WE DEPLOY OUR RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE EACH BUILDING AND RE OPENING THE ECONOMY IN A WAY THAT IS GOOD FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT ADDRESSES OUR INCOME INEQUALITY. ISSUES AND ALSO DOUBLES AS A ECONOMY. AND SO JUST AGAIN WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING ON THIS ISSUE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AFTER THE OTHER PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS FLOCKS THAT- THOSE A SUBSTANTIVE- PRESENTATION AND- CERTAINLY RAISE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH AS WE WANT TO. REBOUND IN SOME FORM FROM- FROM THIS RECESSION NEARING GREAT DEPRESSION LEVELS IMPACTS ON LABOR. IN CALIFORNIA AND TOUCHING ALMOST EVERY PERSON WHO WORKS IN OUR STATE. NEXT I WILL SPEAK TO DIRECTLY TO THE PHONE MODERATOR. WHO IF YOU COULD PLEASE HELP ME- DID INVITE LANCE HE STANDS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. THE CAROLINAS OPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A PERSPECTIVE FROM THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR ON DURING THIS YOU KNOW VERY IMPACTFUL PANDEMIC THAT WERE THAT WERE TAKING THAT OCCURS WE WANT TO START WITH A QUOTE. I'M MIKE TYSON HE SAID EVERYONE HAS A PLAN AND YOU'RE PUT IN THE MOUTH. AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THE THIS. REGARD CREDIT BY IN A PUNCH IN THE MOUTH BECAUSE WE ALL HAD TO. BE FORCED TO A DE TO A NEW LAW. AND WHEN I SAY ALL A US COMING PER. THAT MATTER HOW THEY ARE. A SUICIDE AND THE WAY YEAH IT'S A- BUSINESS OWNER IS A YOUR RETAILER WE'RE HERE LATER. YEAH WE ARE ALL IN. AND JUST QUICKLY AN ATTIC. CMJ STAFF ON FRIDAY MARCH THIRD. SO I'M JUST TO HAVE A- REMOTE WORK SESSION FROM ALL HAS A TRIAL RUN TO SEE. WHAT THE CHALLENGE MIGHT BE IN THAT WE ARE A POOR CASE MAY HAVE TO CHILDREN PLACE A MOBILE YOUR COME MONDAY MORNING. WE HAD INDICATES OF OUR STAFF TO A- WHOLE AND REMOTE WE DONE THAT FOR WEEKS. RATES ABOUT AMONG THE SECTORS AND YOU KNOW NOT SURPRISINGLY BASIL HEARD ALREADY. SERVICE SECTOR IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTED IN WITHIN THE SERVICE SECTOR LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY IS DOWN FORTY FOUR PERCENT. AND SERVICE SECTORS DOWN 23% ALMOST TWENTY FOUR THAT YET MANUFACTURING DOWN 90% AND I WANT TO FOCUS MUCH OF MY COMMENT ON. THAT THAT NOTION THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT IN OUR SECTOR IS SO LOW AND MAYBE GIVE SOME. AND AS TO WHY AND IT GOES BACK TO THAT CHILDREN PLACE ORDER ON MARCH SIXTEENTH. FIRST CALL THAT WE RECEIVED WORD FROM MANUFACTURERS WHO HAD SUPPLY CHAIN IN PROCESS. THEY HAD A HOT DEAL WILL ACROSS THE BILL THEY HAD GLASS BEING ROLLED OUT. IN OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU JUST CAN'T TURN OFF. EXTREME FACILITY. SO WE HAD TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIACY OF THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER. AND WE FOUND THAT MANY OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE LINKS TO THE ARTICLE IT THE STATURE SUPPLY CHAIN OF THE COUNTRY. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT MANY OF US RAIL SALE BUT IT WASN'T. THE ABILITY TO STAY OPEN THAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS HOW WE WERE ABLE TO STAY OPEN. AND THE WAY WE HAVE TO DO SAYS WE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED OUR MEMBERSHIP. TO ADOPT SOCIAL DISTANCE SEEN IN HIS HYGIENE AND ALL OF THE FACILITIES- WHICH THEY DID. AND THEY DID IT IMMEDIATELY THEY WERE ABLE TO STAY OPEN AND HAVE HAD. EXCEEDINGLY LOW OCCURRENCES OF THE VIRUS THAT AMONG ALL WORKFORCE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WORKS ACTUALLY QUITE PROUD OF BUT THE BOTTOM EVERY CASE MANY FACTS FACILITY THERE ARE TWO BEING HERE. OFF A- ALONG THE WAY WHERE EMPLOYEES NEED TO BE AT LEAST SIXTY OR CLOSER. AND HAVING TO ADAPT THOSE. ACTIVITIES BANNED THAT IT DIFFICULT BUT SOMETHING THAT BEEN CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO. SO THAT WAS PHASE ONE. FOR US- AND THEN FACE TO WAS RESPONDING TO THE- THE PERHAPS IN THAT FOR IN THE REGIONAL ORDERS WERE IN. ADDITION TO FIVE MILES YOU CAN'T CHIU VASTLY DIFFERENT. PROTOCOLS BY A LOCAL JURISDICTION ABOUT WHAT CAN AND CANNOT OCCUR WITHIN THE JURISDICTION. THE WILD THE MANUFACTURED SECTOR CONTINUE TO RELY UPON THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. STATUS WAS NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZE OF THE LOCAL LEVEL SO WE HAD A SITUATION WHERE MANUFACTURERS- IN ONE AREA WE'RE NOT ABLE TO OPERATE- OTHER MANUFACTURES. IT PERHAPS EVEN AT A NEIGHBORING AREA. AND THAT WAS A CHALLENGE AND THEN I THINK WHEN THE WESTERN PACKED CHAMBER WHICH IS REALLY THE PURPOSE OF THE START. SELECT HEARING. OUR COUNTERPARTS IN OREGON WASHINGTON AND CAL. INCLUDING THE CHAMBERS AND FACTS IN RETAIL REST WE ALL GO TOGETHER IMMEDIATELY YEAH CALL AND WE- ESTABLISHED A PRO. AMONG THEN REACHED TO EACH OF THE GOVERNOR'S IN THOSE. AT THE TIME THREE STATES. TO REALLY. THE FACT THAT THE ECONOMY. IS LOW THE- RE. ECONOMIES NATIONAL INFECTED. IS GLOBAL IT AND WE IN A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT WERE ABLE TO. SOME CAUSE CONCERT ABOUT FOR AND WE WERE VERY. IMPRESSED AND PLEASED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S TAKEN AT YOU KNOW CRITICAL PERHAPS UNPRECEDENTED STEP. LOOKING FOR WAYS TING COURTNEY NOR AND ORGANIZE THEMSELVES IN A REGIONAL ASPECTS SHOULD BE A PART OF THAT EFFORT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. BUT THERE PHASE WAS THE TO IDENTIFY SUPPLY. THAT'S TO GET OPERATE. AND WE HAVE LIKE THE PART STUNT SURVEYED ARE MY- AND THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS THE MAIN. SECTOR CAL ANYWAYS. ANYWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTY AND 75% CAPACITY. AND AGAIN THAT'S CRITICAL IN THOSE UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES THAT I MENTIONED JUST A BIT AGO. AND BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THINGS GOING TO KEEP THINGS MOVING- WHICH HAS BEEN. QUITE HELPFUL. THE TIED INTO THAT IS OUR ABILITY TO KEEP THE WORKERS EMPLOYED BUT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HOURS AND OUTPUT IS HAVE THE CLIENT AND WE HAVE APPROACHED. THE LABOR AGENCY HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO SEE IF THERE ARE WAYS TO. GET AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM HAVE A FORM SOME OF THE WORK SHARE PROGRAMS. BECAUSE THEY QUESTIONS THAT WERE GETTING FROM OUR MEMBERS WAS. HOW CAN WE KEEP OUR EMPLOYEES BENEFITS GOING EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT EITHER AT WORK OR ABLE TO WORK AND EVERYTHING LED TO THE WORK YOUR PROGRAM IS TRYING TO. FIND A WAY TO ACKNOWLEDGE AT LEAST IN A CRISIS MODE. DAD SOME ACCOMMODATIONS IN THAT SPACE WOULD WOULD AND SHOULD BE IN ORDER IT AFTER ALL THE DESTRUCTION OF LOSING WHAT HEALTH BENEFITS AND HEALTH CRISIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECT. OF ALL FOR BOTH THE EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. SO HAPPY TO SEE THAT- DIRECTOR SUE. ENGAGE AS CONVERSATIONS WITH US AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT A COOKING. UP. TO ADVANCE FOR THE FUTURE. THANK WITH THAT I'M GONNA. LOOK AT THE LAST QUESTION WHICH IS FOR. WHAT WOULD YOUR TODAY LIKE THIS IT UP FOR ME FOR IN REAL. AND ECONOMY. I THINK WE WE'VE ALL EVERYONE THE HERE FROM IS. THAT TAKEN THEIR- AND DURING THE CRISIS. BUT IT'S THE ABILITY WHEN WE COME OUT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS CLEAR. CONSISTENT AND IN FACT BEGIN ABEL'S AND ECONOMIC RE OPENING OR RECOVERING HER HOWEVER WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT. RATHER THAN USING THE OLD RULES ARE APPLIED TO THE NEW SITUATION BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THOSE WILL BE AT THE MAYBELLINE- AS AS ARE NECESSARY. IN PART OF THAT IS LOOKING AT THE LIABILITY WHILE WE RE OPEN. BECAUSE IT'S THE OLD PHRASE TO THEM BUT I AM REMINDED OF THE YOU KNOW YOU'RE DARNED IF YOU DO IN YOUR GARDEN DELVED. BUT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER IN TRYING TO RE OPEN THE ECONOMY'S GONNA TAKE COOPERATION AMONG ALL OF US. WHETHER YOUR EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE. A CIVIC LEADER. SUCH AS YOURSELVES. WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AND NOW THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS. WHAT CAN ENABLE ECONOMY TO REAL BECAUSE IT IS NOT LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH. ONE DOESN'T TURN OFF THE CAR ME AND WANTED TO TURN ON ECONOMY IT IS A- ACCESS IT IS YEAH YEAH. A LOT OF PLAYER A LOT. INPUT YOUR- TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT CMJ IN OUR MEMBERS. ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH. EVERYONE INVOLVED LOCAL REGIONAL. NATIONAL AND GLOBAL AS THOSE CASES- ARE NECESSARY- TOOK TO REOPEN ECONOMY. BUT WE JUST CAN'T JOLTED OPEN AND SOMEONE WOULD YOU CAN'T JONES TO CLOSE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AND PART OF THAT SOLUTION. AND THAT YOU'RE HERE FROM SOME RETAILERS- SHORTLY- FARMERS GROW IT WE MAKE IT AND THEY SELL IT AND IT'S REALLY QUITE THAT SIMPLE AND WE ARE AN ECO SYSTEM. AMONG OURSELVES AS A GROUP AND ONE THAT I'M- HAPPY AND PROUD TO BE PART OF AND- HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. AT LEAST GREATLY APPRECIATED. BY OUR ORGANIZATION AND OUR MEMBERSHIP AND I WILL STAND BY AND- LOOK FORWARD TO A DIALOGUE OR QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. LATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN. THE YOU MISS HASTINGS FOR JOINT US. PHONE MODERATOR I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE RACHEL MICHELIN THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AT THIS POINT. TELL YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU- CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INCLUDED A CALIFORNIA RETAILERS AND TODAY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WE OPENING AND YOU KNOW I WHEN I GET BACK ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT LANCE HAD TALKED ABOUT I WILL SAY I ALWAYS LOOK FOR THE POSITIVE.

BUT THEN ALSO TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE APPRECIATE HIS LEADERSHIP AND HIS TEAM HILL AYE THOSE HIGHER WE ARE TRYING TO HELP OPEN UP THE ACCOUNT. THAT WE DO IT BUT FONG ASSEMBLY AND SAFELY SO THAT WE CAN SEE CALIFORNIA RETURNED TO THE ECONOMIC AND ECSTATIC THAT WE HAD PRIOR TO THAT COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS POSITION EXPECT INTERESTING COUPLE. BECAUSE MY COMPANY. WHAT ABOUT AND TALKING IN THE BACK IT AS BEING EXPENSE AND NONESSENTIAL LIMITS BURST HEY SOME OF OUR MEMBER WERE THE FACT. THEY OPEN BE WRAPPED. ALL OF RETAIL PRICE YOUR BAR BIG BY.

MY WE'RE SEEING SIGNED WITH THE NATIONAL NEWS AND YEAH WE'RE GOING TO LEAD TIME. THE NATIONAL RETAILERS BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. I DON'T THINK IN CALIFORNIA WILL TRULY UNDERSTAND. THE IMPACT. WHAT WILL HAVE ARE INDEPENDENT MALL. BOB SMALL BUSINESSES THE STATE. SO IT THAT WE CHARACTER CA AND WORKED EVERY WE- EDUCATED PREPARE INDEPENDENT RETAILERS. THAT THEY WILL BE TO HOW. YOU KNOW HIT THE GROUND RUNNING BE ABLE TO BREAK CONSUMERS. THEY GOT SOME OF THAT THE REVENUE THEY HAVE MY- WAY BACK THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND WILL HE BE BACK ADULT CONTRIBUTOR TO THEIR LOCAL ECONOMIES THAT THEY WERE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE THEME. RELATED THE PANDEMIC I WILL STAY WITH YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW I JUST EVERY DAY I REALIZE ANALYSIS OF. LOCAL ORDINANCES RIGHT NOW RECORD FIVE HUNDRED DIFFERENT LOCAL ORDINANCES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT CAN BE KIND OF CHALLENGING WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH. AND SUCH A BIG STATE AND WHEN WITHIN A COUNTY THE CITY MAY HAVE DIFFERENT MORTGAGES AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE AND IT'S ONE THAT WE'RE HAVING A CHALLENGE WET. AND THAT THE ISSUE OF MANDATORY BASED ARMORY. AND WE HAVE CERTAIN. AND CITIES AND- OF MANDATED THEY HAVE ABOUT. ARE A HUNDRED PER THE POOR OUT. ABOUT THE- IN MANY CASES ARE NOT COMPANY ARE STEP. FACE COVER BECAUSE- AS THEY WALK IN SHE WAS. TO MAKE WE'RE PROTECTING EVERY. IN THAT IT THAT BUSH MET. WHAT WE HAVE IN THE RIGHT OF WAY IN A DIFFERENT ARE. WHERE SPEAK OF BY AGAINST SALES ASSOCIATE.

THEY'RE WORKING WITH ME TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE SMALLER RETAILERS HAVE ACCESS TO. THAT PROTECTIVE COVERING THEY NEED TO PROTECT OUR EMPLOYEES AND OP THE PROTECTOR CONSUMERS. I THINK RETAILERS ARE.

THE TRAIN ON THE STATE PRODUCT THAT ARE HELD BY THE TO PUT OUT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE ENSURE. GET OUT WE IN CAL AT AND WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO WITH ALL OF OUR OUR- ARE KIDS. IN PARTICULAR THE LARGER. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHER ISSUE PERTAINING TO REALLY BEING WE CALIBEX DRIVING IN THE STATE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THANK YOU FOR. YOUR INTEREST IN A RETAIL WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES THAT WE CONTINUE. TO MOVE FORWARD TO THAT. ARMONK VERY MUCH MISS MISS I WILL NOW ASK THE PHONE GREATER TO INVITE MATTHEW SUTTON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC POLICY OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION TO JOIN THE PANEL. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. I'M IT AIRED MEMBERS THANK YOU CAN MUCH NOT THAT IN CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION APPRECIATE YOUR HOLDEN HEARING APPRECIATE YOU END UP WRITING A TO BE A PART OF IT- WHERE THEY WAITED RESTAURANTS XIN REPRESENTING RESTAURANT THE BALL. ALL TYPES- MOST OF OUR RESTAURANT BASED ARE THE COMMUNITY BASED RESTAURANT THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR DISTRICT. SO THIS OBVIOUS I THINK FOR EACH OF SPEAKER SO FAR AND FRIENDS ON THE PANEL- IT IT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLY UNCHARTERED TERRITORY TO SAY THE LEAST- YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT THE BEGINNING. OF THE WAY THINGS. CAME TOGETHER IN MARCH YOU KNOW FOR THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY WE HAD. THE WORLD'S COMPLETELY CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE UNDER US IN IN A SHORT FOUR DAY PERIOD. I'M SORRY MR KERRY ABLE TO HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU IF YOU CAN SPEAK GOOD. YES THANK YOU SO IT'S LOOKING BACK YOU KNOW I THINK RESTAURANTS WERE AMONG THE FIRST IF NOT THE FIRST TO BE MANDATED- IT SHUT DOWN MOST OF THE OPERATION AND SO YOU KNOW ON SUNDAY MARCH FIFTEENTH- IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH THE GOVERNOR DID- ASK US TO REDUCE CAPACITY IN. CONSTITUTE PERCENT- AND THEN BY THE DAY WE WERE TOLD TO CLOSE WITH THE- EXCEPTION OF THAT YOU KNOW TAKE OUT AND DELIVERY- AND THEN BY THAT THURSDAY MARCH NINETEENTH YOU KNOW EVERYONE WAS SHELTER IN PLACE. SO THAT JUST. RESPONDED IN AN AGGRESSIVE MANNER- AND AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS WESTERN REGION STATE PACKED- IT'S IMPORTANT- THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THE STATE ACTED QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY NO DOUBT- THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY RESTAURANT COMMUNITY IN THE RESTAURANT EMPLOYEE BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED. YOU KNOW HOW THEIR SECTOR BENEFITS BY THE PHASES OF RE OPENING. AND IN THE VALUE OF THE WESTERN PACKED YEAH AND I THINK ONE THING THAT'S CLEAR IS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE PACT WAS YOU KNOW TO PUT RESIDENTS HEALTH FIRST AND BASE IT ON HOW COME HELP OUT COMES IN SCIENCE OVER POLITICS. AND SO OUR CASE NO QUESTION THESE CLOSURES HEART WRENCHING- THEY WERE A DOZEN TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE STATE'S RESIDENTS. IT'LL BE A THAT GOVERNOR'S ALLOWED THE FAITH ME OPEN OF CERTAIN. OF THE ECONOMY. BASED ON COUNTY THE TESTING THAT THEY MET CERTAIN PUBLIC HEALTH BENCHMARKS AND THAT WAS TRUE FOR THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITIES WELL. SO THE HELP THAT BENCHMARKS WERE PUT IN PLACE AND WHERE THE DRIVER FOR HOW COUNTIES WOULD- SUBMIT THEIR REQUEST TO RE OPEN I THINK UNDERSCORES THAT THIS PORTION OF THE WESTERN- ACT- DID PLAYING PLAYED OUT INTENDED- SAFE WHAT WE DO. WHICH NUMBER ONE ISSUE THE RESTAURANT. AND OBVIOUSLY CORONA VIRUSES NOT A FOOD BORNE ILLNESS BUT OUR EXPERIENCE WITH- THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WE LIVE IN ITS RESTAURANTS- IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS. REALLY PUT ON GOOD FOOTING- TO THE BEST THAT THE- TO THE BEST. THAT YOU CAN TAKE PUTTING IN THE TEXT BECAUSE I HAD A- BEEN IN THIS. UNDRESSED WHAT WE'RE IN HANDS OF THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT EVERY DAY IN THE NONPROFIT NINETEEN PERIOD AND WE WILL BE AFTER COVERT NINETEEN INTO MY POINT HERE. THE GOT THE COUNTY. LOCAL HELP. YOU'VE GOT. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN HEALTH DEPARTMENT PAT LONG BEACH IS AN AND WE'RE WORKING WITH ALL OF THEM. INFRASTRUCTURE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH GOT PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF DIRECTORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH THE CONFERENCE OF LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AT THE STATE LEVEL OF SAFETY COALITION OF THESE GROUPS ARE A GREAT WAY TO SORT OF- HARNESS THE ENERGY OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND PROVIDE SOME YOU KNOW CONSISTENT IN SAYING MAP FOR TRUCKS TO READ. IT TO THAT TAX STRUCTURE THAT FORM. GOVERNOR AND THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH- IN ISSUING THE GUIDANCE RESTAURANT AND WE'RE WE'RE APPRECIATIVE OF THAT. SO AS COUNTIES CONTINUE TO MEET THIS CRITERIA- OF RE OPENING AND JUST IN THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS THERE'S BEEN A FLURRY OF COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED- FOR. OWNING A RESTAURANT THE GOVERNOR ALWAYS SAID APPROPRIATELY THAT THE RE OPENING OF RESTAURANTS WOULD BE DONE ON A DIMMER AND NOT A SWITCH AND THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT'S PLAYING OUT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT GOING FORWARD- LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW OUR ABSOLUTELY THE BEST EQUIPPED. TO LOOK REGIONAL RISK AND DO REGIONAL ANALYSIS AND DETERMINE- THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH RESTAURANTS CAN RE OPEN DINING ROOMS IN PARTICULAR- FROM REGION TO REGION BECAUSE- WITHOUT. THAT THE DATA SHOWS THAT YOU HAVE. DIFFERENT CUTS. THE VIRUS DIFFERENT PARTS OF. AND THAT WHAT WE SEEN A LOT OF THE RURAL COUNTIES RE OPEN REST STARTING LAST. AND WE JUST THE DAY THE LAST FEW. WE NUMEROUS REAL POPULATED COUNTIES START TO. THE BACK OF THE PACK BUT WORKED AS AN IT'S STILL. DIFFICULT THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY TO ADJUST TO THESE THINGS OF COURSE ARE WORKFORCE WHICH I'LL GET INTO IN A MOMENT- INCREDIBLY IMPACTED. YEAH ANOTHER THING THAT WAS ASKED IS AT THE REGIONAL AGREEMENT PROVIDED STABILITY- FOR OUR SECTOR AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE REGIONAL. FOR OUR STREETS IT SELECT RELEVANT FOR US ENTER. MEETING STABILITY OF WE'RE NOT A PRODUCT MANUFACTURER OR RETAILER- OPERATIONAL CONSISTENCY STATE TO STATE. IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL I COMPLETELY APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S MY PRIOR WORLD I'M AT BUT THAT. AND PLAYED INTO THE AT THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. EVEN IF YOU'RE THE STATE RESTAURANT OPERATOR WHERE YOU MIGHT THINK THIS REGIONAL AGREEMENT WOULD HELP WITH CONSISTENCY OF OPERATE IT REALLY DOESN'T. AS STATE ACTOR RE OPENING AS WE SPEAK MAYBE ON A SIMILAR GENERAL FRAMEWORK WHICH THEY ARE. BUT AS THE DETAILS OF EACH OF THOSE LOCALITIES IN THOSE STATES WHERE PART WITH. OUR DIFFERENT. THIS IS. THE ISN'T REALLY WELL TO THE REST OF THE SOIL I LEAVE THAT QUESTION. WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT WHAT CHALLENGES ARE WORKFORCE IS EXPERIENCING- AGAIN YOU KNOW MARCH FIFTEENTH YOU HAVE- A DINING ROOM CAPACITY CUT TO FIFTY PERCENT. THE THING I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WHICH YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CUT SPENDING ROOM CAPACITY 250% YOU'RE ALSO CUTTING- THE NUMBER OF STAFF AND TEAM MEMBERS THAT IT TAKES. TO RUN A RESTAURANT SO THE RAP. CLAMPING DOWN TO PRESS DRAWN OPERATIONS ABSOLUTELY LED TO TREMENDOUS JOB LOSS. AND SO JUST IN THE FIRST THREE WEEKS OF THE SHUT DOWN WE ESTIMATE THAT MORE THAN A MILLION RESTAURANT EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES OUT OF THE MILLION A HALF. WOOD LAID OUT FOR FURLOUGHED. SO THAT 70% OF THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY WORK FORCE- LAID OUT FOR LOW JUST IN THE FIRST THREE WEEKS. FORTY NINE AND A CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT. I AM SAYING THAT THEY WERE CLOSED SO AGAIN THAT'S JUST THE THREE WEEKS. OF THE NUMBERS PRESUMABLY IT WOULD HAVE ONLY GOTTEN WORSE WILL HAVE THE SURVEY DATA BACK IN A WEEK OR SO. BUT THE BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE RESTAURANT THE CALIFORNIA NINETY. FOR STATEWIDE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE OWNED IT UP BY IN THE- WRITERS. WE HAVE 60% CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS ARE OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. 64% OF RESTAURANT WAIT STAFF ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND 80% OF CALIFORNIA CHESTER PEOPLE OF COLOR. SO THIS REFLECT THE OUR GREAT DIVERSITY OF THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT ALSO. TO OF THE GRAPHICS AND DYNAMICS OF. THE JOB LAW YOU KNOW HAS HAS RESULTED IN SO EACH DAY THAT PASSES. READ AN INCORRECT .COM YEAH. YOU CAN GREAT ANSWER TO THE RESTAURANT BAR THEIR EMPLOY IN THERE CAN BE. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE PROCESS OF RE OPENING. YOU KNOW I THIRTY GOAL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING- IN ALL OF THE REGION. THE OPENING AN ATHLETE EARLY RE OPEN AN INSTITUTE YOU KNOW PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND DINING ROOMS BATTLE INHERENTLY- BECAUSE OF REDUCE OCCUPANCY IN RESTAURANTS AND GUEST COUNT AND AT THAT MAP IN THAT TRANSLATES AND PULLING YOUR TEAM MEMBERS AND STAFF AND OF COURSE WHEN WE DO ALL OF US WE'RE GENERATING LEFT TAX AND SALES TAX REVENUE PER LOCAL. BUT NINETY PUBLIC THREAT THE STATE ABSOLUTE TOOK A GREAT FAN YOU KNOW NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE STATE'S RESIDENTS THAT THE KEY COMPONENT. OF THE PACT- UNFORTUNATELY. BETA OF THESE PROTECT PUBLIC UP TO SUSPEND AND YOUR DESTINATION OF THE STATE'S RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. AND NOW WITH AT THE- END NOW AND ECONOMIC CRISIS BILL HOLD AS WE'RE SEEING. WE BELIEVE THE STATE AT THE MORE ALLOW. TAKING THAT. THEY'VE BEEN CAUSED BY SEVENTIES MEASURE THE FEDERAL LACK TAKEN WITH THE BUT PLAN AND OF OTHER PACK THIS CENTER IN TERMS OF THE CONCEPT OF THE IDEAS- ELECTRICAL MEASURES TAKEN BY THE STATE. IT 2230% LOSS OF ALL CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT PERMANENTLY. BUT THERE'S MUCH TO BE DONE AND I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINK LEGISLATURE'S CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON INTENDED TO PROVIDE RELIEF- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH PLEDGES JOHN NUMBER OF THOSE ISSUES. THANK MISTER HAYES SPENT OF SHOES ADD THAT AS A RELATES TO ON AND INSURANCE RATES. AND THE FACT THAT WE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL CHOICE OR DESIRE TO HAVE THE NUMBER OF LAYOFFS THAT WE'VE HAD WE DO NOT THINK THE EMPLOYER UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE RATINGS- SHOULD BE INCREASED AND SHOULD BE A PANEL OF PENALTY OF FOR EMPLOYERS AND THERE'S A WAY TO FREE. I KNOW THAT A NUMBER YOU MISSED ARE LOOKING AT ISSUE WHEN WE PRE THAT THERE'S ISSUES RELATED TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE- THERE'S COUNTLESS REGULATIONS- BEING- PROPAGATED DIFFERENT AGENCIES WHICH WE ARE PRODUCTIVE PART. IN THE DISCUSSION AND WE KNOW IN THE END THOSE WILL IN FACT BE REGULATIONS BUT FOR RIGHT NOW IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS. THIS WERE. THINGS GET PUT ON POTS FOR A TEMPORARY TIME PERIOD. WE'RE LOOKING LOT OF DIFFERENT POLICY PROPOSAL THAT NO CAN HELP OF HIBERNATE THROUGH THE REST OF THIS BUT ALSO TO RE EMERGE AS THE- STATE. THE LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYERS. THE FINAL ONE OF THE FINAL QUESTIONS WAS CHALLENGES THAT OUR MEMBERSHIP HAS HAD AN ACQUIRING PP- AND THAT'S A FANTASTIC QUESTION NO I THINK WHAT WHAT I'D SAY AT THE OUTSET IS KEEP IN MIND WE LARGELY BEEN CLOSED VERY FEW WORK IN RESTAURANTS- IT IF YOU WITH NO REVENUE COMING IN. LIMITED TO TAKE OUT OPTION AND THAT THAT NOT A LOT OF REVENUE YOU'RE NOT BREAKING THE WITH THAT BUT IT DOES GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO HELP IMPROVE. SO THE SHORT POINT IS. WE ARE EMPLOYING VERY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT MANDATE TO SHUT DOWN. AS WE COME OUT FROM THAT WILL BE RE STAFFING AND BRINGING ALL THOSE GREAT PEOPLE BACK ON BOARD AND THAT. THE TRUE DEMAND FOR PP. IT FELT BY OUR CAN BE. HELP OUR SO FAR YOU KNOW COVER. I HAVE BEEN AND THE NORMAN STREET FOR A TEMA. AND EVEN FOR GAS AND SOME TERRITORY- INITIALLY THERE WAS A SCRAMBLE TO ACQUIRE ALL THAT NEED SUPPLY OF BASS COVER BUT- HE HAD. ABILITY THAT I THINK THE MOTHER STONE AND THAT THAT IS THAT WE CAN USE NON MEDICAL GREAT PACE COVER- AND SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY THERE JUST IN TERMS. APPLY AND THAT AND EIGHT YOU KNOW I JUST THINK THE OTHER ISSUES AS IT RELATES TO HAND SANITIZERS AND OTHER FORMS OF PP- YEAH INITIALLY- THERE WAS SHORTAGE- THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE MOST OF THE THINGS WE- BRING IN. AND ACQUIRING ABOUT EARLY. MANY OF THEM HAVE BECOME TRONG RECOMMENDATIONS IF NOT MANDATES BUT THE LOCAL. HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS WE SLOWLY RE OPENED- AND SO YOU KNOW THE FINAL THING OUT THEY IN THIS POINT. IT'S AN ARTICLE SYSTEM OF FROM BUYERS FOR THEIR FOOD PREPARERS ARE DRINK FOOD AND BEVERAGE THERE'S- ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS. THAT DO PROVIDE A THIS. BUT SO BEEN FORTY. I'M NOT SURE NEW HE HAD PEOPLE ARE SUPPLYING HAVE THAT PROVIDE THOSE ITEMS AND THEY HAVE BEEN THEY BEEN FANTASTIC- BUT THE CITIES HAVE HELPED SUPPLY US AND WILL CONTINUE TO HELP SUPPLY US. UNIQUE DO MAKE THINGS. HIS MANY FOR BASE AND OTHERS AND I THINK THEY'LL BE A LOT OF NEW AND CREATIVE PARTNERSHIPS TO COME OUT OF THIS WHEN IT COMES TO PP BECAUSE IN OUR WORLD. WE KNOW THAT RESTAURANT ADDING ROOMS GOING TO BE LET THAN FULL CAPACITY THE NEAR FUTURE. NO BASED ON HELP IF YOU. IN PLACE BY THE AND THE LOW. COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT. PP WHEN IT COMES TO FACE COVERINGS HAND SANITIZERS EVEN PARTITIONS AND BARRIERS BETWEEN RESTAURANT BUT- TO ACCOMMODATE PHYSICAL DISTANCING ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE THE NORM THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN PLACE FOR A WHILE. AND SO AS WE RE OPEN. IF YOU'RE GOING GANGBUSTERS WITH RE OPENING AGAIN JUST IN THE LAST FEW DAYS SO THE DEMAND FOR THESE PRODUCTS ISSUED UP TREMENDOUSLY- A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ACQUIRE- THESE ITEMS FOR THEIR COUNTY RE OPENED SO THAT THEY'RE NOT CAUGHT. BUT IT. AGAIN THE FACT IN TACTIC CAN HELP PROVIDE DISTANCE THOSE ARE THE PRIOR ECOSYSTEM- SO WITH REGARD TO THE QUESTION PLAYED OUT- TO OUR CERTIFICATION ON THE VALUE OF THE WESTERN STATES PACKED. THOSE THAT THE COMMENTS THAT I WOULD PROVIDE AT THIS POINT. AND CERTAINLY HAVE PLENTY MORE TO SAY ON THE TOPIC BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME THINK OF WRAP IT UP THERE AND- CERTAINLY WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. DURING MY MASTERS IN AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE PANELISTS YOU. IN REAL DETAIL IT. IS ABOUT. JUST A- ASPECTS OF HOW THE PACKED IMPACTS YOU BUT ALSO ABOUT COLLABORATION- AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT YOU HAVE. BEEN WORKING ON DURING THIS TIME AND THAT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN HELPFUL FOR ALL OF US OF WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO GET THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. I DO TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY. THE COMMITTEE TO ASK FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS TO THE PANELISTS. AND WE WILL WE ARE WORKING WITH A PHONE MODERATOR AND THAT THOSE ARE MAGIC WORDS I GUESS FOR ATTENTION WHEN WE SAY THOSE WORDS. AND SHE IS THEN SPAHN OF TO- TO OUR REQUESTS AND SO THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE TO USE THOSE MAGIC WORDS PHONE MODERATOR AND THEN TO USE THE FULL NAME AND THE ORGANIZATION THAT THE PERSON REPRESENTS. THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE QUESTION TO. US THAT SHE KNOWS WHO TO ME. ON THE LINE- TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION IT MAY BE SOMEWHAT CUMBERSOME AS WELL AS THEIR- AT. ARE TO BE SOME QUESTIONS BUT ASKED MANY PEOPLE SO WILL WILL CYCLE THROUGH AND IT WILL ALL HAVE THE SHINS TO MAKE EVERYONE FEEL TO GET. IF YOU HAVE. SINCE YEAH AND SOME THANK GOODNESS MY FIRST. A MAJOR FROM THE FARM BUREAU SO I HAD A QUESTION- WHEN WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD MOST ECONOMIES A CONDOM IS THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO ARE PREDICTING A REDUCE CONSUMER DEBT AND FOR RESTAURANTS IN THE TERM BOOK DUE TO DECREASED JUST COME AS WELL AS DECREASE DEMAND FOR IN A BECAUSE PEOPLE DEVELOP TO FEED HER FACE TO FACE THANK OUT MOUNTAIN FROM THE- RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION.

GOES TO RESTAURANTS.WHAT SHOULD WE KNOW OUR HOW SHOULD WE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ADDITIVE ADEQUATE FOOD SUPPLY FOR CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS. AND BROADER WITH IN OUR WESTERN STATES PACKED SO WE KNOWS A LARGE PORTION OF FOOD GOES TO RESTAURANTS WE NEVER TO CONTINUE REDUCE AND THEIR HOPEFULLY WILL PICK UP YOU KNOW. AS WE GO FORWARD. BUT HOW DO WE THAT HOLDER THIS SO WE SHARE WITH BENEFIT OUT OF. SUPPLY FOR CALVET IN OUR WESTERN PART THE ONE. FOR SURE THAT THAT COULD FOODS UP RIGHT NOW BOTTOM IS ON THE- AN ISSUE WITH DISTRIBUTION IN TERMS HOW WE GET THE PRODUCT FROM. EITHER OUR FARMS TO ARREST AND TORE A TO THE FOOD SERVICE OUR TO OUR GROCERY SHELVES THE FOOD SUPPLY IS ADEQUATE RIGHT NOW. SO THE FOOD WE EAT THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN TRONG- BUT WE NEED TO PUT A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY AND PUT ONE OF THE ASPECTS WE HAVE IN TERMS OF SOME SORT WE SAW. IS THAT IN TERMS OF FOOD PROCESS IT FOR YOU A RESTAURANT MAY BE A DIFFERENT CUT OF MEAT THAN WHAT GENERALLY. TO A INTO CA A DIFFERENT. BUT JEFF SORT THAT ARE ABLE TO HANDLE A LARGER CUT OF MEAT AND CUT IT INTO THE PORTIONS THAT THEY WANT WHERE IS THIS NOT THE INDIVIDUAL SERVINGS THAT SOMETIMES YOU SEE ON THE CONCERT TRAIL FOR EXAMPLE ALSO SAY FOR BETTER IF OF AN INCH IN BUTTER BEING HARDEST 60% ENDING UP IN THE FOOD SERVICE AND RESTAURANT. ISN'T THAT. THAT'S THOSE AT THOSE. FOOD SERVICE THE- DOESN'T PROCESS IN THE LITTLE CUBES ONE POUND PACKAGES THAT THAT WE BY THE GROCERY STORE. A PACKAGE IN FIFTY FIVE GALLON BARRELS OF BUTTER AND THEN THAT IS BROKEN DOWN. AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW SOME YOUR LARGE BAKERIES USE A LOT OF A LOT BETTER- SO IT'S A MATTER OF. HOW DO WE RETOOL DOWN IN THAT. COME OVERNIGHT- RETOOLING A PROCESSING PLANT ANYWHERE FROM YEAR TO. MORE LIKELY EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN TERMS OF HOW YOU CONVERT FROM A DO A- PERSON FOOD SERVICED MORE INTO. PACKAGING BUT I THINK HE THOUGHT IN THIS IS MORE ON THE- LEVEL SOME OF THESE ARE ALSO. LAWS IN MEMBER. I WILL. STATUS DE. FOR A- PACK. FOR A. RETAIL FOOD SERVICE BE. IN A BOX. YEAH IT'S A THIRTY DOZEN AT A TIME BOXES. THAT LABEL THAN IT IS ON THE CAN SIDE SO WHAT IT TOOK AND ASSIST THE CREDIT OF USD- ACTED FAST AND- ACCURATE. MY THEIR LABELING REQUIREMENTS MEANING. A TO GET EGGS ON THE MARKET- THE X. COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OLDER THAN YOU USUALLY ALLOWED FOR THE CONSUMER MARKET A FORTUNATE THAT WAS AROUND EASTER IF YOU REMEMBER SO THERE WAS A LARGE SUPPLY OF EGGS THAT WERE ALSO AVAILABLE. BUT IT WILL TAKE SOME RETOOLING BOTH ON THE FEDERAL SIDE IN TERMS OF SOME LABELING LAWS IF WE REALLY WANT TO- STREAMLINED HOW WE GET MORE FOOD TO THE CONSUMER SHELF BUT AT THIS TIME REALLY. THERE IS THERE A SHORTAGE OF FOOD AND OF THAT STORE SHELVES MAY BE. OUR FIELDS ARE BARNES ARE NOT. SO J. CENTER THAT QUESTION. IT WILL. IF YOU WOULD KEEP A ABREAST OF WHAT WE COULD DO AND CALIFORNIA RIGHT SOME OF THAT SOME OF THAT FAT AND I KNOW. YOU KNOW YOU'RE WORKING WITH THEM. BUT WHAT CAN WE DO HERE CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THE PICTURES OF MY- DOWN THE DRAIN AND PICTURES EVER SEEN ABOUT FARM WASTING FOOD WASTE WHEN WE KNOW WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE. THAT ARE GOING HUNGRY I HAVE SO MANY. TO DO A KNOWLEDGE HERE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN FOR LOW. AND THEY DON'T HAVE FOOD AND SO IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM. RIGHT THAT WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW YOU SEE THE IMAGES AND YET YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE HUNGRY SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE. AS WE GO THROUGH THIS SESSION. PLEASE THAT IS. WHAT WE CAN DO STERN HELPFUL FAURIA. MAYBE THAT. OF THE ONE STATE DO THAT THAT THE PACKAGE. HOW TO BE. HONEST SOME OF YOU KNOW. CONCERT SPACE. IT JUST ADDRESS THANKS PHONE. BUZZED BUT THERE IS A PROGRAM THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING IS ROLLING EVEN TO BE COUNTY. AND I KNOW IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THAT WAS THE GOVERNOR INSTANT IMPLEMENTING YOU CUT THROUGH THE ON- THE RESTAURANT TO SENIORS PROGRAM. AND A LOT OF OUR SMALLER LOCALLY OWNED RESTAURANTS ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT TO SMALL FARMERS AND RANCHERS. AND IN OUR HIGHER END. UP ATTACKS BECAUSE OF PURCHASING DIRECTLY SO. PROGRAM IS THAT. YOU ALSO. I'VE WORKED WITH. MANY FARM BUREAU STATE PRESS IN TERMS OF THE NEED FOR PRODUCE AND SOME OF THESE WESTERN STATES WORKS IN OUR BACKYARD. AND RIGHT NOW THEY'RE JUST COMING IN THE SEASON HOW CAN WE EFFICIENTLY. GET THEM WHEN YOU KNOW ONE FOOD BANK A CAN'T HANDLE YOU KNOW ONE SEMI TRUCK WILL PRODUCE. GET IT SOMEWHERE. YOU KNOW. AFFORDABLE THANK YOU SIGN AT THE NOW USE YOUR PROTOCOL I'M NOT SURE WHAT WAS THE MAGIC WORD. PHONE MODERATOR. COULD YOU PLEASE PUT ON THE LINE SARAH FOX FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. AIRLINES OPEN. IT WORKS THE SERRA YOU MENTION THAT- A CERTAIN CHUNK OF JOBS ARE NOT COMING BACK IN AND WHEN YOU MADE YOUR STATEMENT AND ONE OF THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN VERY PREOCCUPIED WITH IS WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE SECTOR BY SECTOR AND WHAT RETRAINING PROGRAMS DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT A CERTAIN SECTORAL JOBS. MATT MATCH TO THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY WOMAN. I WOULD LVE TO SEE AT AN ANALYSIS OF WHERE JOBS AREN'T COMING BACK I JEAN. ARTICLES AND SOME ECONOMISTS TALKING ABOUT THIS I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE SOME OF OUR- EXCELLENT RESEARCH- UNIVERSITIES LOOK. THAT OR OUR STATE WORKFORCE BOARD I KNOW THE GOVERNOR ALSO HAS A PROPOSED FOR BURKE AND PARCHMENT WHICH IS GOING TO. PUT TOGETHER A LOT OF OUR WORK FORCE TRAINING PROGRAM SO THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD PLACE TO DO A SCAN OF THE ECONOMY. AND SAY OKAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE GROWTH HERE SO WE NEED TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE TRAINING PROGRAMS I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT. A TRAINING PROGRAM AND IF THAT PERSON GETTING A JOB. I DON'T CAN CHAIR TRAINING GRAHAM OR SIX STORM. ACTUALLY PLACE. JOB WHERE. THEIR EIGHT. PAGE THAT BEING PLACE SOMEWHAT THE- SUPPLEMENT BACK WITH PUBLIC BENEFIT LIKE MEDICAID FOR OTHER PER. I THEN OF COURSE BLOCKING A OUR AND STATE PRO IN MY YOU LEARN WE IS REALLY THE BEST WAY I CAN. PER WORKER TO BE ABLE TO TRY LOW NEWS BUT ALSO MAKE MONEY SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO SUPPORT A FAMILY AND INVESTMENT WILL COMMUNITIES BUT I DO THINK GETTING THAT DATA AND DEVELOPING TRAINING PROGRAMS BASED ON WHERE JOB GROWTH GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE IT GOING TO BE IN. REPORT. THANK YOU- AND MY LAST QUESTION IS- PHჭ MODERATOR COULD YOU PLEASE PUT ON THE LINE. LANCE HASTINGS FROM THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING ASSOCIATION. PLANTS ARE LINED UP IN. WELL THANK YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT THERE WERE VERY WELL RUN MODERATOR AND HEARING THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HAVE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK THIS PANDEMIC HAS DEMONSTRATED IS THE PROBLEM WITH VERY LONG SUPPLY CHAINS ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO PP. WHAT IS IT THAT WE CAN WORK WITHIN THE WESTERN STATES OR WITHIN CALIFORNIA- WITH YOU. TO INCREASE THE AGILITY FOR OUR MANUFACTURING TO PIVOT TO THE CURRENT PANDEMIC. IF WE HAVE A SECOND SURGE OR GOD FORBID A FUTURE PANDEMIC HOW IS IT THAT WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT FOR BEING MORE AGILE AND MANUFACTURING TO HAVE. THE A TO ON SHORE PP AND SOME OF THAT MANUFACTURING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE QUESTION I MEAN IT IS ACTUALLY A TWO DIMENSIONAL ISSUE. IN TRYING TO MANAGE SUPPLY CHAINS AND MY COMMENTS EARLIER I MENTIONED LOCAL REGIONAL NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMY SIT BACK THAT THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE. AND I DID WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT. IT IS PART OF THIS ANSWER TO THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH. THAT BEING OPERATING AT PASSED THE- DURING THAT SUPPLY CHAIN- OF PRODUCTS SAID PLIES. THE MATERIAL IS CONSISTENT COMING THROUGH THERE DO. HAVE MARK SAID PROBABLY AN AND HERALD HEROES DOWN THERE BE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE PROFITS WITH LONG SO TO GIVE A- PROPER SHOT OUT TO THE- PORTABLE ANGELES. WE DO HAVE THAT GLOBAL SO A THEIR IS THAT AFTER HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL WOULD MAKE. LOOK SOME OF THE CALLS WE GOT AFTER. FINISHING SHOCK SAID IN WERE MANUFACTURE VERTICALLY OF LOS ANGELES AREA ASKING. HOW COULD THEY REPURPOSE THEIR OPERATIONS AND START MAKING PP AND OTHER NECESSARY ITEMS BECAUSE THEY'RE WILLING TO DO SO. THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS THEY MAY HAVE THE EMPLOYEES THAT WE HAVE THE TWO MILLION AND DESIRE. THE FINANCE SUPPORT. AND NINETY FIVE MASS YOU LOOK BAD AVE. HELPS YEAH THE MEDICAL GRADE WAS THE IMMEDIATE. AT TO GET THE PRICE OF BUT- YEAH IT'S JUST. THAT NEW THAT MENTIONED THAT WE DON'T NEED BETTER GRADE IN. INDUSTRIAL SETTING. CNC MEMBERS ARE POSITIONED TO HELP WITH THAT- SO CALIFORNIANS MAKING THANKS FOR CALIFORNIANS. IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT. BOTH IN THE TWO YEAR TERM BUT OVER THE NEXT MONTH. IN CASE IN MOST MEDICAL EXPERTS. SAY WE CAN THEY NOT. WELL I STARTED BY. PUNCHED IN THE MOUTH BUT NOW WE BEEN ABLE TO OF THE DAY. IN THAT SECOND PUNCH LATER THE YEAR TO OUR MEMBERS ARE WORKING. AT TIRE. IMPACT AB IT'S ON THE PANEL FROM THE INDUSTRY'S ARE. PARTNERING TOGETHER TO INSURE THAT WE HAVEN'T SO THEN. SLASH PP. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND YEAH GO BE ON THIS MATTER. SO WE'RE HOPING TO. BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE. AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS SEEN THEM. WE CAN ASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT WE'RE TAKING GREAT STEPS TO. INSURE PUBLIC SAFETY BUT ALSO. BECAUSE GOING UNDER A MUCH DIFFERENT PAIR NINE MOVING TOLD. THANK YOU. FAMOUS FOR HER MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING BECAUSE IT'S- ASIDE FROM IT BEING A FASCINATING TOPIC TO TALK ABOUT IT SOME OF THE TIDBITS THAT YOU PICK UP ABOUT WHETHER THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE BILLION IN RETAIL OR 80% OF. BEING AND NON FEMALE PARTY THESE THESE YEAH IT'S A IT'S GREAT TO KIND OF BRUSH UP ON SOME OF THE NUMBERS AND THE VAST LIST OF- THE ISSUE THE DEAL AND HOW WE TRY TO. DATE A THE VERY USED TO THE MOVING PARTS WITH THEM. THE MISS. KAMLAGER HAD LEAVE TO FACILITATE A CALL A LOS ANGELES COUNTY DELEGATION CALL THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ON AS WELL BUT SO SHE- PESTANA QUESTION- TO MR JOHANNSEN THAT I WANTED TO DIRECT MONTH ON HER BEHALF- WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT FARMERS DESTROYING PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE DIMINISHED HOW. DO WE REDESIGN A SUPPLY AND GOODS CHAIN THAT WILL PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING. AND THEN THE WILL BE ASKING A QUESTION A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS OF MY OWN YEAH THERE THERE IS- NOTHING MORE DISHEARTENING HAS- I WAS DOING INTERVIEWS ON KABC SEVEN LIVE. YOU KNOW DOWN A LOS ANGELES AND PRECEDING ME WAS A STORY OF LONG LINES AT A COSCO. AND THIS WAS ABOUT TWO WEEKS FOR THE SEARCH TERM SORTERS AND THE QUESTIONS COMING UP. A THAT WERE TO ME YOU IN TERMS OF IS SHORTAGE WHAT YOU KNOW THOSE CONCERNS AT THE SAME TIME GETTING REPORTS FROM MY FELLOW FARMERS AND STATE FARM YOUR PRESIDENT'S. ABOUT THE MILK DUMPING HAPPY IN WISCONSIN HAPPENING- YOU KNOW I HADN'T. HEARD OF ANY CALIFORNIA AT TH TIME IS STILL HAVEN'T DIRECTLY TO ANYONE. I'M SO IT'S CONCERNING BUT IT GOES TO THAT FLEXIBILITY IN THE FOOD CHAIN AND THAT WILL BE A VERY- THAT WILL BE A VERY WELL THIS STE A TOPIC IN TERMS F HOW. TO CHANGE OR FOR. HOW WOULD BY HOW CAN WE PROVIDE MORE- PROCESSORS FOR FARMERS TO TURN TO WHO CATER TO. YOU KNOW- NOT JUST ONE SEGMENT OF THE FOOD CHAIN AND THAT'S A MATTER HAVING MORE COMPETITION IN THE MARKETPLACE. AND WE CAN BECOME VERY SPECIALIZED IN VERY. VERY GOOD AT WHAT WE DO AND THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SUCH THAT WE OFTEN FORGET HOW COMPLEX. THE COMPLEXITY THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THAT DIVERSITY- SO- THERE'S NO QUICK EASY ANSWER RIGHT NOW. IN TERMS OF STOPPING THAT TO HAPPEN- BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT THAT YOU KNOW SIMPLY CUT FOOD MILK. PLANT COULD TAKE MORE MELTED IN THE CAPACITY PASTEURIZATION ASSIST. TO GET THE CONSUMER HAND. OR TO A YOU PUT A IN FOR THE. HE SAID. IT'S A QUITE. KOCHHAR YOU KNOW. FOOD PROCESS WILL BE WILL BE DISCUSSING FOR A LONG TIME. THANK YOU. LIKE I GOT TWO QUESTIONS. AND THIS IS I'D LIKE ALL OF THE- SPEAKERS AND PANELISTS TODAY TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT SO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE ALL LISTS INTO THE AN OR IF WE NEED TO INDIVIDUAL. THANK YOU. FOR MODERATE IF YOU MAKE EVERY HEARS THIS QUESTION AND EVERYONE IN ORDER IS ABLE TO OR WHOEVER CHOOSES TO PARTICIPATE IN ANSWERING. ANSWERS IT. SO ONE IS. IN GENERAL AND. A AND YOU YOU WERE ASKED THIS QUESTION SO I APOLOGIZE IN KIND OF BRING THIS UP BUT I FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE I'M SURE WITHIN EVERYONE'S TRADE ARENA- THERE ARE THESE CONVERSATIONS OF WHAT THE- SECTOR- AND THE MARKET SECTOR. BUT THE PRODUCTION AS WELL AS THE MARKET IS GONNA LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE HOW IS THIS GONNA CHANGE HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING TO CHANGE. WHAT THE NEW NORMAL IS GONNA BE IN PART OF THE REASON WHY I ASK IS WE'RE GONNA OVERCOME. THIS SPECIFIC VIRUS BUT THIS CAUGHT US FLAT FOOTED AND THIS DEMONSTRATED TO US THE FRAGILITY OF THE- SYSTEMS WE HAVE IN PLACE. AND THE MARGINS THAT WE OPERATE AT AND SO IT IT THE IT BASICALLY- UNVEILED A LOT OF AREAS THAT- A LOT OF AREAS ESPECIALLY IN HEALTH CARE THAT THAT THAT. WE'RE OPERATING AT SUCH THIN MARGINS THAT- WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CHALLENGES TOOK TO OVERCOME. SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE THE FUTURE. OF YOUR SPECIFIC INDUSTRY OR SECTOR BOTH IN THE PRODUCTION SIDE AS WELL AS ON THE MARKET SIDE. CHANGING. I KNOW IT'S VERY BROAD BUT- BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR BECAUSE TODAY IT'S COVERED NINETEEN TOMORROW BUT MAY BE SOMETHING ELSE SOMETHING A LOT MORE EVEN AGGRESSIVE THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH A CO OF NINETEEN AND JUST FOR THIS GO ON. CLEAR AND- XIN WILL AGAIN MISTER JOHNSON JOHANNSEN AND THEN WE'LL CALL THE NAMES AND THE ORGANIZATIONS. IN SUCCESSIVE ORDER- FOR AN OPPORTUNE FOR EACH OF THEM TO HELP THE PHONE MODERATOR- ORGANIZE THAT TRAFFIC THAT THANK YOU YEP YOU KNOW I CAN ASK BOTH QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW AND EVERYONE CAN ANSWER BOTH QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH. THIS IS OUR IN THANK YOU THE SECOND POINT WAS AND THIS IS AND TOTAL AND MATT MISTER SUTTON THE- I NOT PICK IN UP. ON THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION THE REST INDUSTRY FOR YET BUT IT'S THE BEST EXACT THAT CAN. IN STRAIGHT. PROVIDE THAT DEMONSTRATES. A VERY CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ALL SECTORS- THAT THAT THAT- CAN FALTER. THE OTHER NIGHT MACINNES MENTIONED IN RESTAURANTS NAME I WAS IN SACRAMENTO I WAS CAN WE AFTER I LEFT THE- CAPITOL BUILDING AT A SEVEN. OCT WHEN BY SOMETHING TO EAT. AND WHEN I. FRONT DOOR OPEN I WALKED PUT IN AN ORDER AND THE- OF VERY HELPFUL- INDIVIDUAL AT THE BEHIND THE DESK BEHIND THE COUNTER BEGAN STARTING PREPARING THE MEAL. AND OF HE WAS USING HIS GLOVES AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE BUT AS HE WENT DOWN THE ASCENT THE FOOD ASSEMBLY LINE. APPEARING THE MEAL FINISHED IT UP AND LOOKED AROUND TO SEE IF THE- CASHIER WAS WAS THERE REALIZE THE CASHIER WAS OUTSIDE DOING SOMETHING ELSE SO HE PROCEEDEDAND TAKING MY PAYMENT RINGING ME UP AND TAKING MY PAYMENT EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND NORMAL. I JUST NOTICED THOUGH THAT WHEN HE- TOOK MY PAYMENT HE TOOK MY CREDIT CARD MADE THE PAYMENT. CHARGE MY CARD GIVE THE CARD BACK TO ME AND JUST OUT OF INTEREST I WANTED TO SEE IF. HE WAS GONNA TAKE OFF HIS GLOVES. UP I WALK OUT AND I SLOWLY WALKED TO MY VEHICLE SO THAT I A TAKE ENOUGH TIME AND IT WAS A VERY LONG MAYBE A MINUTE- TIE MY SHOELAE DID DID DIFFERENT THINGS TWO CHESTS SEE WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. UP ULTIMATELY FOR THE MINUTE THAT I OBSERVED HIM HE DIDN'T- CHANGES GLOVES AND HE WENT BACK TO CLEANING UP HIS STATION WORKSTATION AND TECH. CATER TO THE NEXT PERSON. I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE- WE CAN GO THROUGH. THE STEPS OF ANYTHING. TO BRING A ENTIRE WORLD ECONOMY TO A SCREECHING HALT. GET OF CERTAIN THIRDS AREN'T. WELL ESTABLISHED. YOU'RE A AT AT AT THE MOST SIMPLEST LINE AMONG THE BUSINESS CHAIN THANKS COULD EASILY BROKEN BREAK UP. YEAH THE- AND YOUR FIVE JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT I'M SAYING WE CAN GO THROUGH ALL THE PAINFUL CHOICES BUSINESSES CAN SHUT DOWN PEOPLE HAVE TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING AND EVERYTHING CHANGES IN THE ARENA AND BECOMES DIFFICULT BUT UP FOR THE VERY PURPOSE OF MAKING SURE THAT. THE CERTAIN QUALITY IS GUARANTEED AND A SHIRT AND PEOPLE SAFETY ARE ASSURED YET. YOU KNOW ALL IT TAKES IS FOR THAT GLOVES THOSE GLOVES NOT TO CHANGE. AND UP FOR THE CAR CROSS CONTENT THE CONTAMINATION TO TAKE PLACE BECAUSE WHEN THAT GENTLEMAN TOOK MY CREDIT CARD HE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I. HAVE THE VIRUS OR NOT- I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE THIS CAN HAPPEN IN ANY INDUSTRY. IT CAN HAPPEN IN ANY PLACE IT JUST THIS WAS THE BEST EXAMPLE BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S THAT WE'RE ALL DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW AND WE SEE IT UP FRONT. AND SO. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE THE STANDARDS WATER HOW WERE THE INCENTIVES GOING TO BE PUT INTO PLACE. WITH INCENTIVES OR STANDARD SOME SPEAKING OF LOOSENING STANDARDS IN CERTAIN CASES. YOU KNOW HOW WE SOME. UP PROCEDURES STANDARDS INCENTIVES GOING TO BE PUT INTO PLACE OR WHAT NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT. EVEN AT THE MOST. A BASIC LEVEL OF RISK EXECUTION. THINGS ARE DONE IN A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT. ALL THIS THAT'S HAPPENING. IS FOR NOT. BECAUSE OF THE VERY SMALL MISTAKE THAT HAPPENS AT THE TAIL END OF THE EXECUTION. SO SORRY FOR THE VERY LENGTHY- QUESTION AN ANECDOTE BUT BUT I THOUGHT IT'S JUST THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO PAY ATTENTION TO SOME OF THESE DETAILS AS WELL. THANK YOU. WELL I GUESS I'LL START ON. YEAH IT'S A COMPLEX QUESTION THAT LIKE I SAID IN THE PREVIOUS IN THE PREVIOUS ONE WE'RE GOING TO BE WRESTLING WITH FOR A LONG TIME BUT THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE A QUICK PIVOT TO FLEXIBILITY. AND THAT MAY BE ON A FARM LIKE SUCH AS MINE I MAY BE SELLING TO A PROCESSOR- WHO JUST CELLS- MY OLIVE OIL IN MY ALL OF THE GOING DAHLE BOIL TO RETAILER OR TO- INTO A FOOD SERVICE THE FIFTY FIVE GALLON BARRELS. CAN I. FLEX TO- AS IF THAT CONTRACT RISE UP CAN I CAN I MOVE TO A DIRECT CONSUMER SALE CAN I MOVE BACK INTO THE FARMER'S MARKET OR EVEN AN ONLINE PRESENCE AND WE'RE SEEING FARMS TRADITIONALLY LARGER FARMS HAVING PLAYED IN THAT ARENA BEGIN TO INTRODUCE THOSE THOSE DIRECT TO CONSUMER- PLANS JUST LIKE WE HAVE TYPICALLY SEEN IN SOME OF OUR OUR SMALLER FARMS- WE HAVE TO LOOK AND HAVE TO HAVE AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT- THE- HOW WE HAVE LOST REGION AUDI. IN THE WEST AND CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR IN TERMS OF- THE PROCESSORS AVAILABLE WHETHER THAT'S AN ALL OF PROCESSING PLANT OR A MEAT PACKING PLANT OR A CUSTOM- MEAT PACKING PLANT WE HAD STRONG REGIONALISM WHEN I STARTED TO I STARTED FARMING I START MY FARM IN NINETY THREE AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE SEVEN AND EIGHT OR FOURTEEN IF ALL OF. OUR SUIT FOR THE DOLLAR. THERE NOT MAKING THAT. SITUATION ROSE IN TERMS OF OUR- IMPORTANT AND WHAT NOT BUT THERE. WE END UP ONLY TWO NOW IN THE- WHICH IS VERY LIMITING IN TERMS OF WHO CAN SELL TO THEM SO LOT OF US WERE LOCKED INTO AN OLIVE OIL MARKET- WE CAN LOOK AT THE MEAT PACKING PLANTS WE SEE PEOPLE NOW- AT CONTACTING. A LOT OF RANCHERS INTERESTED IN BUYING HALF OF BE FOR YOU KNOW A SHARE OF A QUARTER A THIRD- BUT THERE SIMPLY ISN'T THE CAPACITY OF A LOCAL BUTCHER SHOP. AND THEN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE STATE STANDARDS THAT WOULD PREVENT THE EXPANSION OF THAT AND- AND A LOT OF THAT IS A FEDERAL STANDARD BUT CAN THE STATE. PLAY A BETTER. IN TERMS OF EASING THE REGULATIONS OF. OF A- LETTING CONSUMERS GO DIRECT TO FARMERS. TOM THE FEAR HOWEVER IS THAT IS THAT BECOMES A NECESSITY TO BE ABLE TO PLAY BOTH IN A RETAIL. AND IN A IN A IN A DIRECT TO CONSUMER SALES. AND MAYBE MICROPTERIX TO CHANGE MAYBE I HAVE TO ADD ANOTHER. CROP THAT. APPEALS THAT COULD CARRY ME THROUGH THE TOUGH TIMES THAT MAYBE IS MORE OF JUST A- A CONSUMER. GROCERY STORE TYPE PRODUCT- AND IF I CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT IN THE MARKET DEMANDS IT FIRST- WE HAVE CONSULTED. AND I. THINK THAT WE GOT. OUR CULTURES. TO PREVENT THAT THE CONSOLIDATION FORTY HAPPEN A MONSTER. MORE ALSO IS. HAVE SIX HAPPEN WITH HER FARMS. AS A WE GET.AS REGULATIONS AND AS- POSSIBLE AS FOR US WE IN. A IN A RECENT STUDY. ON A LETTUCE FIELD IN SALINAS OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS- THE JUST THE REGULATORY COSTS OF PRODUCING THAT LETTUCE. HAS RISEN OVER 7100% IN THE LAST TWELVE YEARS. THAT'S A HUGE BURDEN ON A FARMER. AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THE DIRECT. PROGRAMS BY USDA WE TALK ABOUT. THE TAX CREDITS THE STUFF WE GET WORKING WITH FOOD BANKS AND WE AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE FOOD BANKS. IT DOESN'T COVER SOME OF THE REGULATORY COSTS. THAT HAVE DRIVEN US INTO A VERY SPECIFIC ON FLEXIBLE MARKET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHOI HANSON WILL MOVE NEXT TO SERRA FLOCKS POLICY COORDINATOR OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND PLEASE BE MINDFUL. THAT WE'VE OTHER PALACE ALSO WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I WILL GO VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE QUESTION WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC AND WE COVER A LOT OF INDUSTRIES- BUT IN TERMS OF. WHAT COULD BE DONE DIFFERENTLY I MEAN I THINK ONE THING WE NEED TO DO IS DEFINITELY SHORE UP OUR OUR SAFETY NET- OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM NEEDS. MASSIVE REFORM TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN A PROTECT PANDEMIC AN ECONOMIC CRISIS LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE AND THEN I LOST SO AGREE WITH MR NIGERIAN. OUR HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THAT SHOW ME THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A BIRDS EYE VIEW OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY HOSPITAL WHERE I TO YOU THAT WE HAVE. IS ONE PROBLEM THERE IS NO AGENCY THAT. HAS OVERSIGHT OVER THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WE HAVE. YOU KNOW HEALTH PLAN REGULATORS HOSPITAL REGULATORS. HOW TO BAIL. YOU KNOW DATA COLLECTION AND SO I DO THINK WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF BEING ABLE TO. TO UNDERSTAND OUR HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY AND DEPLOY RESOURCES BOTH THE WORKFORCE AND AWFUL SUPPLY. AND I'LL LEAVE IT THERE FOR THE OTHER. FAMOUS FOR NEXT WE WILL TO LAN HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. THE I'M SORRY PHONE MODERATOR WE WILL MOVE TO LANCE HE STANDS PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. AT A GLANCE ACTUALLY DISCONNECTED. THANK YOU PHONE MODERATOR WE WILL MOVE NEXT TO RACHEL MICHELIN PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION. LAP JUST RECONNECT AND- WE'LL MOVE BACK TO LANCE AFTER WE'RE FINISHED WITH WITH MISS MICHELIN THANK YOU. OKAY WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHY OUR SECTOR MIGHT LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD AND YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE THEM CHANGES AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SOME CHANGES THERE'S BEEN SOME MAJOR NATIONAL- RETAILERS DATA DECLARED BANKRUPTCY- AND WE ALSO HAVE THE NATIONAL RETAILERS WHO ARE CLOSING. DOOR NORDSTRAND AS AN EXAMPLE ANNOUNCER COOKING SIXTEEN STORES IN CALIFORNIA I AND MY HEART A DATE WHY- SHRINKING OF THE OF THE FOOTPRINT OF SOME OF THE STORE WHICH I THINK WAS XCELERATED BY THE PANDEMIC- I THINK IT'S LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WE HAD THAT ON MY MARKET PLACE IS REALLY TAKING OFF I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING. THING TO LOOK AT IS. ARE WE GOING TO SEE MORE PEOPLE. SURE ON MY- AND NOT GOING BACK INTO THE- WHICH THEY WOULD MEAN BURKE AND MORE STORE WOULD BE MORE BECAUSE THEY KNOW MORE SO FORWARD. OR ARE WE GOING TO SEE FOLKS WANTING TO GO BACK INTO THE BROKEN WATER STORAGE THIS IS THE CONVERSATION THEY WERE HAVING EVEN BEFORE THAT CAN'T GET A CAT. AND AGAIN I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DIVIDE IT UP IN THE QUEUE KIND OF. I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE AND I WILL SAY THAT BACK. WHEN WE SHUT DOWN AND WE WERE IN THE SHELTER IN PLACE. IT DIDN'T FEEL A LITTLE BIT AND IT FEELS A LITTLE BIT MIKE BACK NOW THAT WE TAKE. IN TERMS OF RETAIL RETAILERS THAT CAN THAT ARE WRITING IN THIS ECONOMY AND WHAT BRAND AND RETAILERS THAT ARE BEING PUT OUT OF BUSINESS AND WE'RE PICKING KIND OF WINNERS AND LOSERS AND BACKFIRED REALLY HOPE GOING FORWARD WE KIND OF GET RID OF THIS ESSENTIAL NONESSENTIAL I THINK ALL BUSINESSES ARE ESSENTIAL THE CALIFORNIA THERE ARE SPECIAL TO THE ECONOMY THERE ESSENTIAL TO OUR LOCAL ECONOMY THIRD SPECIAL TO THAT. THE FOLKS THAT WORK IN THE AND ALL DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF BUSINESS. I SO I THINK FOR ME I TALK REALLY WATCH THE IMPACT SMALLER RETAIL. AND HOPING THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT THROUGH YOU MAY SEE THEM. VERY MAYBE A BIT BETTER BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE FOLKS IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY WANT TO GO WAITED OUTLOOK LOCAL BOOKSTORE. LOCAL GET SHOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT PERSONAL CONNECTION AND THEY WANTED TO BE THERE LOCAL START FEEDING. AND BUT I THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WILL KNOW THE FULL IMPACT. FOR ANOTHER. YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND TODAY AS A MATTER OF FACT IN. CALCULATOR WEEKEND ONE OF THE LARGEST SHOPPING MALLS WITH OPENING. AND SO I'M CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THAT WORK. HE SAN DIEGO OPENING THE LAR MARKET THEIR OPENING FOR. YOU KNOW DO PEOPLE SHOW UP DO NINE SO I THINK IT'S A LITTLE EARLY TO BE- BUT THAT IMPACT IS BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT I ENCOURAGE PARTICULARLY SMALLER BUSINESSES IS THAT THEY DO HAVE TO RETAKE GOING FORWARD THEIR THEIR BUSINESS PLAN IN TERMS THAT. ONLINE PRESENCE YOU KNOW IF WE DO HAVE A SECOND WAVE ENSURING THAT THEY CAN DO CURBSIDE IF THEY CAN STILL NEW AND GOODS TO THEIR STORES. REALLY INCREASING YOUR ONLINE PRESENCE AND HOPE THAT WE CAN. IF WE DO GET IN ANOTHER SITUATION LIKE THAT. RETAILERS CAN STILL BE SOMEWHAT COMPETITIVE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT A BROADER. YOU KNOW LOOK AT A BROADER PERSPECTIVE AND REALLY NOT GET INTO THIS ESSENTIAL NONESSENTIAL I WOULD IN TURN SAID THAT YOUR QUESTION ON THE TRAINING AND THAT'S ACTUALLY AN INTERESTING ONE WE'VE BEEN HAVING A LOT OF INTERNAL DISCUSSION. ARE NOT TRAINING BECAUSE I THINK THAT- PART OF OUR JOB AND IN THE ASSOCIATION IS LOOKING AT THIS AND HOW CAN WE TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN PROVIDING RESOURCES TO OUR MEMBERS WHEN IT COMES TO TRAINING AND YOU KNOW I LOOK AT IT FROM A PERSPECTIVE THAT. YEAH I CAN'T SERVICE IN A POINT KIANA BORDER COMMISSION I TAKE ONLINE TRAINING FOR MY ETHICS TRAINING OR EXPECT A HARASSMENT TO THE STATE IF WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT WE CAL THEM FOR YOU TO THAT THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS FROM THE GUIDELINES THAT WERE PUT OUT BY THE STATE IN IN DC. SO YOU KNOW WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER OTHER MEMBERS I'D I THINK TRAIN. WORKERS I THINK. INDUSTRY AND I'M TRYING TO TAKE THAT ARE IT AS A LEADING OFFENSE. FOR THE WEEK JUST CAL. SHE PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF TRAINING A THAT STATE HE NEEDS THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A STATE SHOCKED CREDIT. SO THAT CAN. AND LOCAL LACK THERE IS NO THIS PARTICULAR RETAILER HAD GONE FEEDBACK TRAINING. AND THAT THEY ARE TRAINED IN ALL THAT. THE GUY COMPRISES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT AND- WELCOME OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THAT. THANK YOU MISS MICHELIN PHONE MODERATOR WE WILL MOVE BACK TO LANCE HASTINGS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHINA POLITICS UP FOR DROPPING THE CALL I HAD. A QUICK GENTLE AND THE TIME WAS NOT DOES NOT IDEAL- REAL BRIEFLY ON THE FIRST QUESTION. MEANS TO BE SEEN WHAT WE CAN EXPECT THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR THEM THERE'S THREE SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT. ONE IS THAT THERE'S COULD BE TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC SURGE- ONCE THINGS THAT NEED TO RETURN TO SOME KIND OF NORMALCY ANALOGY AS WE DID BEFORE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE. A AN OLD NORMAL THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW NORMAL- OF WAR AND CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IS GOING TO RETRACT AND REMAIN SELL FOR. AT LEAST THE NEXT TWO QUARTERS MAYBE INTO THAT MIDDLE PART OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAH THAT FOR US- AGAIN YOU CAN'T CLICK ON THE SWITCH TO THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR THERE'S- A PLAN TO NEED TO GO INTO PLACE. SUPPLY CHAIN THE NEED TO BE SECURE IN ANTICIPATION OF A CONSUMER DEMAND. THAT IS WHAT IT IS AND- SO WE ARE ALL STILL IN THE LEARNING MODE. I'M HOPING OF COURSE THAT THERE IS THAT- A SURGE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AS THE SUMMER. BEGINS BUT. HELLO BACK SEEING. HIS OWN. IT APPEARS THAT FIRE BUT- BY. IN ADDITION ALL THE OTHERS THAT'S- AROUND THE WORLD THAT IS GOING BE WITH US SOMETIME. IT IS THAT CONSUMER. THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE- WATER TAKEN TO REWRITING THE PUBLIC BEHAVIOR. THAT IS GOING TO BE AROUND THE TERM- ON HOW MUCH AND HOW FAR WE CAN. REOPEN ECONOMY AND- RICHARD THIS ELECTRONIC ACTIVITY- ON THE SECOND QUESTION A REAL CURIOUS WHEN THE DEADLINE CAME OUT FOR THE MAN BACK. SECTOR WE REVIEW THEM. WE JUST. WHAT WE KNEW ALREADY IS THAT THE- ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. AND SAFETY IT'S SUCH A CRITICAL COMPONENT FACTORING. THAT WE HAVE ALREADY ADAPTED THE NEW CRACK. INTO A- MANUFACTURING PROCESSES BUT WE HAVE IN THE STORAGE- YOU SHOULD PHD THAT OUR EMPLOYEES IN OUR OPERATIONS ARE USED TO IT EXPECTED. THE MANY. ANYBODY PUT ON I PROTECTION. LIKELY YOUR PROTECTION AND I'M KIND PUT PROTECTION IN ORDER JUST TO VISIT THE FACILITY. SO THEY'RE ABLE TO DOUBT THAT- AS WAS. POINTED OUT IN THE- BEFORE I IF YOU HAVE ONE CRITIC POINT OF WE CAN REALLY GO CHALLENGES LIKE AND MINORITY. MAN INTO THE COMMUTER SO I THINK THAT THE MANY. SIDE THE IF YOU ENTER A- MANY BACK TO SELL YOU PROBABLY ALREADY GO THROUGH. SOME OF THE AT PVO YOU CAN AS THE TRACES PROVIDED AN INFORMATIONAL POSTER TO NOT JUST OUR MEMBERS BUT TO THE ENTIRE MANUFACTURING SECTOR. THAT LINKS- A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION IT PROVIDES GUIDELINES ON AND TO BE PUT ON THE VERY FRONT DOOR THAT EVERY FACILITIES AS YOU WALK INTO OUR APPROACH A CUSTODIAL NOW THAT AND THEY ARE TAKING THE INCREASED PROTOCOL APARTMENT THAT QUITE SERIOUSLY. YEAH BABY JUST A QUICK MOMENT AS I CLOSE TO SAY THAT YES IT'S A PANDEMIC YESTER SOME HEALTH- REQUIREMENTS YOU NEED TO BE- CIRCULATED AROUND BUT IT'S THE COMMUNICATIONS EFFORTS FROM ALL OF OUR INDUSTRY GROUPS INCLUDING OUR OWN THAT REALLY PROVIDE THE GLUE. ATTACK GET THE INFORMATION OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO GATHER IN A TRULY IS A COMMUNICATIONS ORIENTED RECOVERY THAT WERE ABOUT TO ENTER INTO BECAUSE WITH WITHOUT COMMUNICATION NOT REALLY KNOW HOW TO PROCEED. AND THE CHALLENGE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSIONALS WORK IN ALL OF OUR INDUSTRY TRADE GROUPS AND MEDIA FOR COULD YOU KNOW TO CARL AND AT THE T. A BUT IN TERMS OF KEEPING MANUFACTURES AND FOR. AN ENGAGED- THAT BECOMES FUNCTIONS CRITICAL HOLE IN THAT'LL. ARENA THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER HASTIE. PHONE MODERATOR WILL MOVE TO MATT SUDDEN AND I WASN'T ADMONISH ANYONE PARTICULAR I SAID PLEASE KEEP. QUESTION YOUR AND TO REGIONAL AMOUNT OF TIME. YOUR ANSWER IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND WE WANT TO GET IMPORTANT INFORMATION OUT OF THOSE ANSWERS- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT TIME- THAT WE HAVE AS WELL SO MR SEND PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR MODERATE. CERTAINLY MISTER CHAIR I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND APPRECIATE IT- YEAH BUILDING ON THAT WITNESS MICHELIN SAID- SAID THAT HE AND THE TO YOUR QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER NECESSARY AND- YOU KNOW THERE'S TWO TWO THINGS SAID TO STYLUS REALLY WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE RESTAURANT SPACE AND- YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW. AND LEARN THE TRACE JUST A WEEK OR TWO AGO FROM ASSEMBLY. ASSEMBLY WOMAN BOERNER HORVATH WHICH IS RE IMAGINING RESTAURANT AND YOU KNOW I KNEW THE CONCEPT BUT SHE GOING TO TURN AND IT IS EXACTLY TRUE BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE KNOW THAT RESTAURANTS ARE NOT. FEEL A BIT DIFFERENTLY GO FOR. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CONSUMER DEMAND IT'S GOING TO BE- THERE'S A LOT OF INDICATORS THAT CONSUMERS ARE READY TO GET SOME SEMBLANCE OF NORMALCY BACK. IN YOU KNOW A MONTH AGO IT WOULD HAVE SAID. PHYSICAL DISTANCING FACE COVERINGS. CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS TO HAND SANITIZER THROUGHOUT ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE SAID BOY. THOSE ARE GOING TO FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE RESTAURANT SETTING BUT YOU KNOW NO WHAT WE KNOW NOW. AND HAVING LIMITED OPERATIONS FOR THE LAST MONTH OR TWO I CAN TELL YOU THAT THESE THINGS AND ESPECIALLY AS COUNTIES ARE RE OPENING NOW. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT CONSUMERS WANT TO. AND WHEN THEY WALK INTO A RESTAURANT THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN SOMEONE NORMALIZED NOW. AND SO THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WILL MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE WHICH IS AN IRONY COMPARED TO WHERE WE WERE WEEKS AGO. SO THE POINT IS THAT GOING TO THE NORTH FOR THE FIRST. FUTURE SEEING THINGS THAT HAVING THESE PROTOCOLS. TEACHERS KLAY BUT NOT JUST THE STATE OF THAT FIND. A DATE COMMITTEE. BUT THE FIFTY EIGHT CAN SUPPORT CITIES THAT HAVE THEIR OWN HEALTH THE- ARE IN GUIDELINE PROTOCOLS OF A LOCAL NATURE. SO IT NOT THREE. THROUGHOUT STATE YOU COULD ARGUE IT PART A LITTLE CLUNKY BUT FOR THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. THAT IS THE SYSTEM THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT- HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RISK ASSESSMENT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL AND ALLOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO OPEN UP AT DIFFERENT PACES WHICH- FOR US. GETTING ANY OF THESE OPENINGS BACK IN A SAFE MANNER IT'S HELPFUL. SO THE FUTURE WE'RE NOT EALLY SURE THE CONSUMER DEMANDS MISTER HASTINGS IN THIS MICHELIN STATED- THAT THE QUESTION- BUT WE DO THINK THE MORE OF THESE PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES- THAT ARE IN PLACE. THE MORE CUSTOMERS WILL COME BACK AND OUR GUESTS ARE ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN NEW AND DIFFERENT DINING EXPERIENCES AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH LOCAL CITY GOVERNMENTS. TO CHANGE ORDINANCES TO ALLOW GREATER USE ABOUT DOOR AREAS FOR DINING ABC ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL IT'S ALSO BEEN. VERY HELPFUL IN THE PROCESS THAT PEOPLE CAN GO THROUGH- TO HAVE OUTDOOR DINING WITH ALCOHOL SERVICE TO SOME DEGREE IF APPROVED. SO YOU'RE GOING TO SEE CITY STREET SHUT DOWN SIDEWALKS USED TO A GREATER EXTENT PUBLIC THOROUGH WAYS ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO HELP ACCOMMODATE. THE PHYSICAL DISTANCE THING AND I THINK ALL OF THOSE MEASURES TOGETHER ARE GONNA HELP CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND WE WILL SEE PEOPLE COME BACK TO RESTAURANT. ON A DIM NOT THE SWITCH BUT I DO THINK THAT'S WHAT. THE AS FOR THE SPECIFIC. AT THERE BRING. YEAH I WOULD SAY THIS IN THERE ARE NEWMAN PRE ALREADY IN PLACE PRIOR TO COPE WITH NINETEEN NOBODY DOES FOOD SAFETY BETTER THAN THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY IT'S ONE OF THE SAFEST PLACES TO EAT MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE HOME KITCHENS AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF ALL THE HEALTH AND SAFETY MANDATE TO PROGRAMS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PUT FORTH IN THAT COME WITH IT REPORTED- THAT OUR IN PLACE. AND SO HE TO YOU TOO IN THE MANSION YES GOING FORWARD THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF NEW- SUGGESTIONS PROTOCOL THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND OUR BIGGEST THING TO OUR MEMBERS HAS BEEN HEY YOUR IN A GATE RIGHT NOW I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET BECAUSE OF THAT GATE BUT DO NOT GET OUT OF THE GATE DOOR OPENS SELECT FEW SPENCER DAYS PUTTING THE NEW PROTOCOLS IN PLACE AND THE NEW PROTOCOL SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR EXAMPLE HAVE MANDATORY HAND WASHING INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THE DAY THAT'S KIND OF NORMAL THE- FOOD SAFETY IS WHAT WE DO SO THIS IS WHAT WORK THAT AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE- YOU KNOW THERE'S GOING TO SNACKS WITH NEW TRAINING AND- LOCAL HEALTH. IT BILLION ONE FORCE THAT AND IT THEATER THE H. OF THE RIGHT. HIS WRIST. TO CAN. TO OUR- ABOUT THE NEW BEST PRACTICES PROCEDURES PROTOCOLS THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING AND AGAIN DO THEM BEFORE YOU OPEN YOUR DOORS. BECAUSE THERE'S NO QUESTION TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. OF MANY OF THESE PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL BUT THEY'RE GONNA TAKE ADDITIONAL STAFF TRAINING. AND THAT IS WHAT WE DO BEST AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO RISING TO THE OCCASION. AND DOING JUST THAT BUT- YOU KNOW I HEAR YOU- I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SO AND I THINK THAT MISTER NAZARIAN HAS SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. WELL IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT MATT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WANTING TO. GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THAT I APPRECIATE THAT BUT JUST SO I REITERATE THE POINT THIS IS THIS WAS NOT AT ALL TO. PICK ON ON THE TO MAKE A CRITIC CRITICISM OF THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY OR SECTOR I KNOW THAT EVERYONE'S BEEN ON HEIGHTENED ALERT AND WORKING VERY CAREFULLY. AT MY POINT ABOUT THAT WAS JUST THAT IN ANY SYSTEM YOU CAN TAKE. VERY PAINSTAKING. STEPS AND IMPLEMENT PROCESSES THAT OVERHAULS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. BUT THEN ALL IT TAKES IS. IN A AT ONE SMALL STEP A SIMPLE THING DOESN'T HAPPEN AND SO IT COMPROMISES THE INTEGRITY OF THAT ENTIRE OVERHAULIN CHANGER THAT SYSTEM THAT YOU HAD NEWLY SET UP AND SO THAT WAS THE POINT IN AND THE POINT WAS THAT THIS CAN HAPPEN IN ANY INDUSTRY ALSO- SO THAT'S WHY IT WASN'T AT ALL. TO PINPOINT IT WAS JUST THE BEST EXAMPLE GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE AT A LOCAL RESTAURANT OTHERWISE IT'S VERY MUCH APPLICABLE TO EVERYTHING ELSE SO THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH MATT. I THANK YOU MISTER YEAH AND I YEAH I THINK. WE'VE GOT THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION HE WASN'T SPECIFICALLY CALLING OUT RESTAURANTS IT WAS AN ILLUSTRATION OF WHERE AND THE STATE CAN BE MADE AND THAT CAN HAPPEN IN ANY INDUSTRY SO THAT. IT WAS WHAT THE POINT WAS MADE AND IT WAS NOT AT. AT ALL. SELECT YOUR INDUSTRY SO THANK YOU. SO PHONE MODERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE. PUT LANCE HASTINGS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ON THE LINE. THANK YOU HERE YES THANK YOU SO MUCH SO WE HEARD A LOT EARLY ON ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S LACK OF USE OF THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT AND- AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS GOOD WEATHER WAS BAD WEATHER WAS EVEN POSSIBLE. TO RETOOL MACHINES TO DO SOME OF THE WORK THAT- PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE DONE WE TALK ABOUT TOO MANY FACTORS OF PP SPECIFICALLY HERE IN- IN CALIFORNIA BUT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE OR HOW HOW SLOW- OR QUICKLY SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD HAVE WORKED IF. THE PRESIDENT DID IN FACT USE IT IF IT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE AND YOU KNOW CONVERSATIONS WITH INDUSTRY ABOUT THAT. YEAH I MEAN IT'S ALL ACCIONES WE'VE LEARNED SOMETHING EVERY NEW DAY AT THIS. CRISIS AND WE BAD DID BUT I AND I HOPE THAT THAT POLICY MAKERS LOOK BACK. ONCE WE DO GET YOU THROUGH THIS INITIAL. RUN WITH COCA NINETEEN. FIFTY WILL WORK AND WHAT NEEDED TO BE ADAPTED. TO THE DEPEND PROTECTION ACT I'M SEASON PRODUCTION ACT OF COURSE. IS A DRASTIC STEP. IT COMMANDEERS A FACILITY AND REQUIRES PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN MATERIALS. ON THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE S A SUPPLY CHAIN THAT CAN BACK THAT UP. AND THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE IN SOME TIMES AS WE TALKED BEFORE THAT GLOBAL- THAT SUPPLY CHAIN IS AVAILABLE ONLY GLOBAL. IN GETTING THAT MATERIAL TO THE UNITED STATES FOR PRODUCTION I BECAME JOB ONE WHICH IS WHY I MENTION THE PORT ACTIVITY. ON THE WEST COAST TO THE AND THE CRITICALLY A VITALLY IMPORTANT- I THINK WHAT COULD DO THAT WE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE. BUT THE KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT CLEAR KNOWLEDGE MINT. WE NEEDED ACT. WHETHER THAT WAS A FACEMASK OR HIS DATA TIZER. AND THEN- URGE THE INDUSTRY SECTOR THAT- PRODUCES THOSE TEMP TO MAKE BECAUSE I. AM A NINETY FIVE MAPS ARE IN VERY SHORT SUPPLY AS WE ALL KNOW BUT THERE IS A MEDICAL APPLICATION. AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT. AT PRODUCT IT'S NOT THAT THE YOU CAN JUST HIT THE- YOU'RE OPERATIONS AND IF I AM. HERE HASTY TEXTILE. MADE THAT COULD SERVICE MAKING A NINETY FIVE. WITH IN MAYBE. THAT IF NOTHING ELSE FROM WAY UP WE CAN THE KIND OF THE SPELL THE NOTION THAT. DEMAND CAN MAKING. IN A UNIT IN ME PIVOT. WE CAN ADAPTER UPPER OVER TO WHICH IS A WE'RE DOING UP FOR THE NON MEDICAL. PP BUT IT IS. CONTINGENT SUPPLY CHAIN. YEAH I THINK I DON'T SPEAK FOR MY- CAR PARTS- IN THE AGAN- GOOD ACTORS. THAT LEADS TO THE GIRL IN THE BACK ROOM AT THE GROCERY STORE. I MEAN IT COMES FROM SOMEWHERE. AND WE ALL NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS. VERY INTERTWINED WITH ONE ANOTHER AND GETTING- ITEMS AND THEN PRODUCTS TO THE CONSUMER. THAT IS NOT EASY THAT MAY APPEAR MONEY THEIR TV ARE ARE KIND OF HOUSE PRESENTED SOMETIMES. SO THAT THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION IF THE DRAFTING STEP. ONE WE SEEN NOT TO BE. MATHIS BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS CRISIS HAS EVOLVED. WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS IN DIFFERENT PROPERTY ON ANY GIVEN DAY OR WEEK. AND ARE YOU TO ADAPT TO THAT. I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY PROVEN. INEFFECTIVE AGAIN YOU CAN START TO SEE. THAT HE IN PLACE ON OUR STREETS AND NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. PRIMARILY BECAUSE THAT MANY TAX SECTORS ABLE TO MAKE THOSE ITEMS. DO YOU YOUR INTEREST FOR. ONLY NOW TO MISS JOE HAS. WHO IS HERE THE ROOM FROM THE CAL FARM BUREAU WANTED FOLLOW UP WITH YOU A- YOU KNOW THERE'S TALK ABOUT. TO IN SOME AIR. OR OR A- SCARCITY IN IN OTHERS AND THE- THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD WITH FOOD BANKS FOR EXAMPLE AND- YOU KNOW THE THAT THAT WAS SO HELPFUL. TO SO MANY SO QUICKLY- ACROSS THE STATE CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. YEAH AND- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS SACRAMENTO- YOU KNOW WORKING ON THOSE INCENTIVES FOR FARMERS TO HELP COVER COSTS OF HARVESTING ONE OF THE- TOUGHEST QUESTIONS WE GOT NEWS THAT ARTICLE I'D READ IN A- VALLEY NEWSPAPER- IN ONE PART OF THE CITY OF FARMER DISKIN UNDER. YOU KNOW LETTUCE HER OR HIS CROP AND THEN OF COURSE. A FOOD BANK THAT WILL SHORTEN HOW DO WE GET THERE AND WHY THE DISKETTE UP BECAUSE YOU KNOW BUT THE ULTIMATE THING IS YOU HAVE A FARMER WHO IS YOU KNOW. PROBABLY GOING TO STRUGGLE FOR THE REST YEAR TO HANG ON AND SURVIVE. IT STILL COSTS MONEY TO HARVEST IT STILL COSTS MONEY FOR THE MANPOWER- IN A TO HARVEST AND THEN TO GET IT TO- TO A FOOD BANK AND TRUCKING COSTS AND EVERYTHING THEN WE ALSO HAD KIND OF SORT OF A LABOR SHORTAGE. BECAUSE SEVERAL SHELTER IN PLACE SO TO THE GOVERNOR CREDIT- CALLING OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD TO ASSIST IN TERMS OF MANPOWER. ONE OF MY LOOK GOING TO NEED DISCUSS AS WELL AS A STORAGE CAPACITY OF THOSE FOOD BANKS- WE CAN THE PRODUCT TO THEM BUT- A LOT OF IT IS PERISHABLE- IF NOT REFRIGERATED SO AND WE CAN THAT'S- IN WITH. ON WORK. A FULL BANKS GETTING HERE THAT WELL BUT ALSO TO HOW DO WE- THIS IS MORE ON JUST FEW DISTURBING CAN. WORKING WITH THE USDA YOU'RE SEEING NOW FOOD BOX PROGRAM COME ONLINE- BUT YOU'LL ALSO SEE IN JULY NOW- FARMERS TO FAMILY- PROGRAM TO USD AND WORKING WITH THE FOOD BANKS. BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF THE REGULATION STAYING AWAY BEING APPROVED VENDOR THROUGH THE USDA TO DISTRIBUTE ACCESS COMMODITIES BECAUSE SECTION THIRTY TO. A DISTRIBUTION A PROGRAMMER THE FUNDS COME FROM BUT HOW DO WE STREAMLINED WHO IS QUALIFIED TO ACCESS FUNDING THROUGH THE U. S. T. IN SOME OF THEIR PROGRAMS TO DISTRIBUTE. TO THOSE IN NEED WELL SO THERE'S A LOT. IS IN A BOOK FOCUS ON STEP WE'VE BEEN THE ASKING FOR A WHILE NOW THE URGENCY. IS A. A GREAT GIFT. THANK YOU MISS MICHELIN'S WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TRENDS AND HOW- IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT THE TRENDS ARE GOING TO BE. PRE PANDEMIC ABOUT. WHETHER PEOPLE ARE COMING BACK TO BRICK AND MORTAR AS A SHOPPING EXPERIENCE AND CERTAINLY. A NEED OR DESIRE FOR PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF THEIR HOME- AT POST PANDEMIC IF THAT'S GOING TO SHIFT OR CONTINUE TO MOVE. INTO A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE THAT IN PERSON EXPERIENCE. YOU'RE ALSO SEEN. WHAT WHAT RESTAURANTS FOR CHALLENGED BY WHICH WAS A CURBSIDE PICK UP. AND WHETHER THAT SOME A RETAIL EXPERIENCE THAT THAT CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO BE. SEEKING AS WELL. ONE ONE THING THAT WE'VE HEARD THROUGH THE PANDEMIC IS. THAT SOME NATIONAL RETAILERS. HAVE NOT PAID RENT. AND THAT'S PROBABLY MOM AND POP STORES HER KNOW OF- HOW IS THAT LONG TERM. GOING TO CHANGE ANY OF THE TRENDS AND WILL THERE BE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR MOVEMENT THAT MAKES THE YOU KNOW CURSE PER SQUARE FOOTAGE SALES- FORMULA DIFFERENT. BASED ON. ANY MOVEMENT ON BECAUSE- OVER. A REALIST. FOR RETAILERS. THE GREAT QUESTION I THINK THAT. THAT'S DEFINITELY I TRY WHERE LOW OUT BUT MINUTE HOW BECAUSE WE SAT A IF YOU KNOW ONE EXPECTING AT. A LOT OF THE BUSINESS PROPER WERE WORKING WITH SOME OF THEIR CAñADA CAN TURN OF MAYBE CAPTAIN ON THEIR- TO THE AND THAT AT LEAST. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE HOW. I HAD TRYING TO KEEP THEM IN IN THAT SHOPPING CHEN BECAUSE THEY WANTED AND THAT THEY HAVE TENANTS WHAT THE PRODUCT PASS NO ONE REALLY KNEW HOW LONG WITH ACT LOOK AT THE LAST. I'M I DO THINK THAT BACK GOING TO BE A GREATER. MARK TO HAVE TO HAVE. I THINK YOU MIGHT SEE SOME SHRINK AT WORK IT YEAH CAL WORK YOU COULD NOT A LARGE. AND YOU KNOW NASH BRANDS ACRES WITH THEM OF THEM ALL DEPEND ON HOW THE RECOVERY DOES DEPENDING ON HOW THE GO YOU KNOW ON WHO YOU TALK TO. THEM BOTH THANK YOU MIGHT YEAH AT A GREAT LICCARDO QUICKER THAN PEOPLE ARE IN MY BE A SLOW RECOVERY THERE'S FACT. BUT I THINK THAT GONNA BE A AT A REALLY BIG ISSUE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE'RE SOME OF THE LARGER ONLINE. STORES THAT ARE OFTEN NOW LOOKING AT POSSIBLY BY SOME OF WE CAN THE NATIONAL WE THAT ARE FILED. SO I THINK YOU'RE TO BE NEXT YOU MIGHT THINK CHAU. AND WE THAT WILL AT THAT FOR THAN WHAT SEEN IN THE PAST. I BUT I DO THINK IT IS OF THE RIGHT THE WORK FOR. EIGHTY FOUR WEEKS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PROBABLY LIKE FAN COUNTY TO WORK WITH. HEARING ON HAND I LOOKING AT A JULY OPEN. AND OF PEOPLE BY THIRTY SENT A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR I THINK. AFTER FOR MORE VERY IT'S BUT THE COUNTY TO OPEN. AND BUT ONE THREE SEE THE MORE OPENING IN CALIFORNIA. REALLY SEE WHAT BECAUSE WHO IS GOING TO BE I BACK FROM WILL BE ABLE ANSWER THAT BACK. AND MARK AND I'D TO BACK IN OR HAVE. THERE I THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON A KIND AND THEY'RE REGIONALLY YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S WITH OTHER STATES IN AND YOU SEE THE TRENDS NATIONALLY WITH LABOR LAWS AND PROTECTIONS DO YOU THINK THAT WE WILL NEED MORE LEGISLATION DUE TO THAT THE PANDEMIC AND HOW TO PROTECT WORKERS OR DO YOU THINK THAT FROM A REGULATORY STANDPOINT CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR LET'S JUST BE SPECIFIC ABOUT CALIFORNIA IS IN A PLACE TO PROMULGATE- CODES AND REGULATIONS TO PROTECT PEOPLE- NECESSARY- GIVEN THE RISKS THAT. THAT WE'RE FACING. I'M I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY VERY GOOD LABOR LAW. I THINK WE MAY HAVE LOST MISS FLOCKS. THERE ARE MINOR YES SHE DISCONNECTED OKAY WILL WILL COME BACK TO HER- PHONE MODERATOR CAN WE PLEASE HAVE MATTHEW SUTTON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION. AT THE HEAD MATH. THANK YOU O MISTER SUTTON THE BIG QUESTION I HAVE AND I THINK A LOT OF US- WHO ARE STRUGGLING SUPPORTER LOCAL RESTAURANTS SIR OR DEALING WITH IT IS- THAT- WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE FOOD DELIVERY SERVICES THAT UBER EATS THE DOOR DASHES ARE TAKING AN ENORMOUS CUT. OUT OF THE FOOD- THAT THE COST OF THE FOOD- WHEN YOU'RE BUYING FROM A RESTAURANT IN THE RESTAURANTS REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE OF AN IN PERSON OR AT LEAST- YOU KNOW AWAITED DIRECTLY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PERSON BUYING THE FOOD. HOW HOW REAL IS THAT RISK OR ARE THOSE SERVICES ACTUALLY HELPING PEOPLE GET THROUGH- THAT THE STATE HOME ORDER- OR WAS IT JUST MERELY A BANDAID THAT TIED WASN'T SOLVING THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY GLAD TO BE AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE IN THE EARLY PHASES OF RE OPENING AND TO HELP IMPLEMENT TAKEOUT ORDERING AND DELIVERY. THE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES HAVE HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN HELPFUL AND CRUCIAL TO THAT WE CAN'T SURVIVE ON TAKEOUT AND DELIVERY ALONE- SO THAT IS THAT IS CERTAINLY A BANDAID BUT GOING FORWARD- YOU KNOW THERE'S AN EMPHASIS ON CONTINUING. DELIVERY AND TAKEOUT BUT DINING ROOMS ARE SLOWLY REOPENING AS AS WE KNOW SO- THEY'LL BE A COMBINATION OF BOTH I DO THINK THAT TAKE OUT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A LARGE. LARGE PORTION OF THE BUSINESS WE DO- INTO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT SOME OF THOSE- IRRITANTS THAT RESTAURANTS HAVE WITH REGARD TO UPWARDS OF 30% TAKES ON EACH ORDER- THAT A CUSTOMER MAKES WHEN THEY DO THE DELIVERY. THAT YEAH THAT'S IT THAT'S AN IRRITANT IT'S AN ISSUE OF CONTINUE DISCUSSION AND- SOME OF THE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY GRANT TO SUSPEND IT DOES IN THE- IN THE MIDST OF THE CRISIS- AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT- AND THAT IT THAT THAT THE- BIG COMPLICATED ISSUE AND- YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT WHERE WE'RE- GRATEFUL THAT SOME OF THE BRANDS HAVE. OF SUSPENDED SOME OF THEIR COMMISSIONS ARE LIMITED THEM IT IS A SENATE'S HOPPING FROM A RESTAURANT TO DELIVERY SERVICE COMPANY. RELATIONSHIP OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE RETAILER EVER PARTY THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION- OTHERS ARE HAVING. MORE GLOBAL CONVERSATION WITH THEM ABOUT HOW TO GET THROUGH THIS WITHOUT ONEROUS FEES. THANK YOU WERE SIR HAVE A AND HAVE FOR QUITE A LONG TIME HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH SOME OF THE INDIVIDUAL THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES- BUT- YEAH GENERALLY THESE ARE WORKED OUT BETWEEN THE RESTAURANT AND THE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANY- AND THEN YOU KNOW LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO- HAVE GONE FORWARD WITH THEIR OWN LOCAL ORDINANCES AND- MANY MANY OTHER LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE LOOKING AT DOING THEIR LOW. ON LOCAL ORDINANCES ON THIS TOPIC IN AND OTHERS AS IT RELATES TO THIRD PARTY DELIVERY. I THANK YOU MISTER SUTTON FUN MODERATORS MISS FOX BACK ON THE LINE. HI MISTER STANLEY MEMBER YES I'M ON THE LINE THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE. I APOLOGIZE MY HUSBAND AND I ARE WORKING AT HOME AND WE DON'T HAVE FULL BAND WITH- YES I THINK CALIFORNIA LABOR LAWS ARE VERY STRONG AND GOOD ENFORCEMENT AGENCY RIGHT NOW LIKE I MENTIONED CAL OSHA IN TERMS OF ENFORCING THAT- WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY RE OPENING GUIDELINES IT'S GONNA BE KEY. THAT THEY HAVE A FULL FINDING THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO HIRE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND ALSO HAVE APPROPRIATE PP- ENFORCEMENT OF EIGHTY FIVE IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL- THE AG HAVE A LAWSUIT BUT- AT T. ALSO NEEDS TO START COLLECTING BACK TAXES FROM COMPANIES THAT MS CLASSIFY- UBER AND LET ALONE- FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS- TO THAT YOU Y. FUND WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL IN IN PROPPING UP THAT BUNCH. AND I DO THINK SOME OF THAT- EMERGENCY ORDERS THE GOVERNOR HAS ORDERED EACH AND SOME OF EVEN THE FEDERAL LAWS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE IN TERMS SAYS QUOTE UNQUOTE EMERGENCY. JOB PROTECTED LEAVE AND PAID LEAVE ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND NOT JUST IMPORTANT DURING EMERGENCIES STATE WE SHOULD CONSIDER EXTENDING THAT AND JUST LIKE I HAD MENTIONED SOME OF THESE ESSENTIAL WERE REALLY SACRIFICIAL WORKERS. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT. WORKERS THAT DURING A PANDEMIC WE DEEM ESSENTIAL. THAT NOT INTENDED AMERICORPS CONSIDERED MINIMUM WAGE ALMOST DISPOSABLE WORKERS I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW. AT INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE AND MAKING SURE THAT WORKERS HAVE THE BENEFITS PROTECTION THE DIGNITY THAT THEY DESERVE FOR THE WORK THAT I THINK FRANKLY BE UNDERVALUED- ESPECIALLY IN CARE INDUSTRIES THE ONES WERE TAKING CARE OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR ELDERLY WORKING IN NURSING HOMES AND HEALTH CARE. THANK YOU MISS FLOCKS AND WILL PUT ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF EVERY JOB THAT EVERYONE HAS AND I FEEL YOUR PAIN ON THE BAND WITH ISSUE AT HOME AS SOME WITH TWO CHILDREN- LEARNING BY ZOOM AND A WIFE WHO ALSO WORKS- IT. WE'RE ALL WORKING FROM HOME EXCEPT FOR A DAY LIKE TODAY WERE IN HERE IN THE CAPITAL. I THINK A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS CAN IDENTIFY WITH WITH THAT CHALLENGE.
