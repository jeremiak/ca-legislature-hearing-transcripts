SORRY -- TO BAKE YOU WAIT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS ON THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE -- BUT I WANT REALLY WANT TO THANK MY CO CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN IN OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND COMMITMENT. WE GET A TRANSPARENT DELIBERATIVE PROCESS AND WE ALL. WE APPRECIATE ALL THE PUBLIC INPUT THAT WE RECEIVED TO IMPROVE [inaudible] THE PACKAGE THE MARK UP LANGUAGE REFLECTING CHANGES POSTED ON THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WEBSITE. AS I STATED ORDER FOR EVER FIRST HEARING. MY GOALS WERE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD FIRST AND FOREMOST. TO FIGHT FOR THOSE THAT WERE DEVASTATED THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES. TO PREVENT FUTURE WILDFIRES. FROM CLAIMING NEW VICTIMS SECOND PREVENTING RATEPAYERS AND TAXPAYERS PAYERS FROM BEARING I DO COSTS. AND WE LOOK AT THE CONFERENCE REPORT WE CAN SAVE ADVANCES THOSE GOALS IN A VERY MEANINGFUL WAY. IT ALSO IMPROVES -- WHAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING IN OUR LAST HEARING? MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT IT'S NOT PERFECT. AND LITTLE THAT WE DO A HERE EVER AS FRANKLY -- BUT WE MAKE REAL PROGRESS WHICH WILL HELP SAVE COMMUNITIES. AND PROTECT RATEPAYERS. WE CAN'T GO BACK IN TIME TO CHANGE PAST RAT TRAGEDIES. BUT WE MUST STAND WITH VICTIMS AND LEARNED FROM MISTAKES OF THE PAST TAKE REAL STEPS. TO PREVENT FUTURE WILDFIRES IN IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES GOING FORWARD. WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT BUSINESS AS USUAL IN A WORD. IS UNACCEPTABLE. CLEARLY UTILITIES IN THE CP YOU SEE. NEED TO BE FORCED TO STEP UP. IT IT SURE THAT THEY'RE MEETING OUR SAFETY NEEDS BEFORE DISASTER STRIKES. IN THIS PACKAGE WILL HELP US MEET THAT GOAL. I HAVE BEEN ON A MISSION OF WILDFIRE RECOVERY PREVENTION AND MITIGATION ALL YEAR. THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE BETTER UTILITY PLANNING A GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY TO OPERATE THE GRID. INCLUDING CHECKING COMPLIANCE BEFORE THERE'S A FIRE. THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THE CPU HE HAS DONE QUITE POORLY REGULATED UTILITIES IN ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY. STRENGTHENING THE FIRE FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES SUCH AS VEGETATION REMOVAL MUTUAL AID INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE UTILITY COMPANY INSPECTIONS INTEMPERATE SHUT OFF THE POWER DURING EXTREME WEATHER. OUR HOLISTIC APPROACH WILL SAFEGUARD CALIFORNIA AGAINST FUTURE FIRESTORMS CAUSED BY OUR GRAND OR OTHER SOURCES. THIS IS ALSO ABOUT PROTECTING RATEPAYERS AND COMMUNITIES NOT JUST HELPING UTILITIES. IF THE FIT LEGISLATURE FAILS TO ACT AVOIDABLE FIRES WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. FAILURE TO PASS DIED S. B. NINE OF VICTIMS PREVENTION MEASURES THAT ARE SO DESPERATELY NEEDED. AND REPAIRS WE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG. AGAIN THIS PACKAGE IS ABOUT COMMUNITIES VICTIMS AND RATEPAYERS [inaudible] PAST. PRESENT AND FUTURE. AND ULTIMATELY WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM. AGAIN THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO'S HELPED CRAFT THIS PROPOSAL IT I LOOK FORWARD TO IS A SIGN IN THE CONFERENCE REPORT [inaudible] THIS EVENING. SO WE HAVE A CONFERENCE REPORT IT BEFORE US. I KNOW THIS IS QUICK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THIS IS THE WAY IT IS THE TIME IS WHAT IT AT IS. I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT NOW IF I HAVE A MOTION -- TO APPROVE. MISTER CHAIR I WOULD -- BE PLEASED TO MAKE THAT -- MOTION. ABILITY LET ME SAY THIS AS I MAKE THE MOTION. OF THIS IS BEEN A AS I'VE SAID BEFORE VERY CHALLENGING. PROCESS. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT. MANY OF US WERE STILL GRAPPLING WITH WHAT DIRECTION WE WOULD WE WERE GOING AND EVEN UP TO TWO O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT [inaudible] AND WE HAD TO MOVE. WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US TODAY THEIR ELEMENTS IN IT THAT I DID NOT NECESSARILY [inaudible] FEEL COMFORTABLE. BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT WE DO AS LEGISLATIVE BODY HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY THAT. I'M PREPARED TO STEP FORWARD AND ASSUMES. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. TO NOTE THAT. THOSE WHO HAVE HAD -- COMMENTS EVEN UP TO OUR LAST MEETING LAST NIGHT FROM THE RATE PEER GROUPS [inaudible] THAT THERE. CONCERNS AND FRUSTRATIONS WE TAKE. THE GREAT -- SERIOUSNESS. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL LISTS REPORT THIS CONFERENCE REPORT. ON IN TOTAL. IS THE RIGHT WAY FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO MOVE TO ADDRESS THE VARIOUS ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE US AND SO I WOULD. SECOND I WOULD MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE AN ADOPT. THIS CONFERENCE REPORT AS PRESENTED TODAY. WAIT BEFORE YOU SAY AND I JUST THINK IT'S WHAT I JUST HEARD FROM THE LEGISLATIVE -- COMMITTEE SECRETARY. IF THERE'S A SECOND ON THIS THERE'S NO FURTHER DISCUSSION FROM THE DIETS I AM FINE WITH THAT. BUT THAT IS THE RULES OF THE LEGISLATURE I JUST FOUND THAT. IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO MAKE A A SECOND THEY STILL CAN BUT THOSE ARE THE RULES. THAT SHE'D I DON'T THINK SHE WON ALL THE WAY THROUGH BUT SHE WANTS TO NASHIK. SO THOSE ARE SECOND. NO I'M IF ALRIGHT SO WE HAVE A SECOND WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND. SO GONNA DO IS WE'RE TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD NOT US. SO WE CAN. OKAY A WE GOT GOOD. BOTH WITH. FIVE FOR IT SO. LOOK IF FOLKS SORRY THAT WE'RE JUST GET THE RULES AS WE GO HERE IT'S A ONE OF THOSE THINGS. SO WITH THIS GOVERNMENT SO. FOR PURPOSES OF TAKING PUBLIC COMMENT I WITHDRAW THIS THE THE MOTION. SO WHAT WE'D LIKE YEARS -- IF YOU WANT TO COME UP -- STATE YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION AND WHETHER YOU SUPPORT. WHETHER YOU SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL OR NOT. I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT FROM RIGHT THERE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAN'T COUNT WITH SENATOR GAS ELECTRIC -- AS UTILITY WITH NOT A SINGLE PENNY OF OUTSTANDING LIABILITY AND INDUSTRY LEADING PRACTICES AND PROGRAMS IN PLACE WE VIEW THIS. LANGUAGE ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE FINAL LANGUAGE I'M NOT SURE ON THE ISSUE WHAT WHAT IT IS THAT'S IN THE CONFERENCE REPORT. BUT WE WE ARE GREATLY CONCERNED WITH WHAT'S IN HERE WE THINK THIS TAKES A STEP BACKWARDS FROM YESTERDAY -- AND POSSIBLY A STEP BACKWARDS FROM WHAT SOME EXISTING LOT TODAY. WE HAVE GREAT UNCERTAINTY ON WHAT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS HOW THEY WILL VIEW THIS. I WAS WE WERE NOTED IN JULY. THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT DOWNGRADES OF THREE NOTCHES AT THE UTILITY ONE NOTCH AT THE PARENT COMPANY. IF ACTION WASN'T TAKEN BY THIS FRIDAY. THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT YOU KNOW INSERTED SORRY -- THE SCOUTS IT'S YOUR NAME WITH THE SUPPORT THE PROGRAM OR NOT KNOWS THE RULES. LEADS TO GREATER UNCERTAINTY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN -- MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL SAW CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION IN IF I MIGHT ASK A QUESTION. WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN THE REPORT THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE VOTING ON SO JUST TO BE CLEAR WERE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS. REGARDING DRAFTS WE'VE SEEN PREVIOUSLY OR HIGH WE'RE ANYTHING HERE LOOK AT MICHAEL. CAN'T YOU GET WHAT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA GO BACK. TO CHIU CO CHAIR AND I DECIDED JUST NOW WE'RE WE'RE FINDING OUT THESE RULES AT THE LAST MINUTE WE'RE GONNA GO BACK AND DO WHAT WE'VE DONE FROM THE BEGINNING. WE'RE GONNA GIVE EVERYBODY A MINUTE HAVE TAUGHT IF IT'S GONNA BE A MINUTE AND YOU'RE DONE. AND I'M SORRY BUT WE GOT A CLOCK THAT WERE. NOT WE WE'VE GOT -- TO GO TO CAN'T YOU'VE GOT THIRTY SECONDS. THIS SONG SO SPECIFICALLY THE LANGUAGE NOW SAYS THAT WE WILL GO THROUGH A REASONABLE S. REVIEW AND AFTER THAT IS DONE WE MAY RECOVER. EXISTING LAW PROVIDES WE THINK GREATER CERTAINTY THAT IF YOU GO THROUGH A REGIONAL OFFICE REASONABLENESS. YOU GET RECOVERY THIS GETS A SECOND BITE AT THE APPLE THIS VERSION ALSO REMOVES ANY LANGUAGE BY RELATING TO FINANCIAL STATUS SUNDAY'S VERSION HAD ONE APPROACH YESTERDAY'S VERSION HAVE ANOTHER. ON ACCOUNT OF STATUS TEST. THIS CURRENT VERSION AS WE UNDERSTAND IT NOT HAVING LOOKED AT WHAT WAS HANDED OUT HERE -- REMOVES BULLSHIT. I THINK IT IS OUR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS EQUITY MICHAEL SAW CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I APPRECIATE WORK. RECONSIDERATION ON THE COMMENTS OF SPECIFICALLY LIKE TO DRAW ATTENTION -- TO THE ARE AND I WITH A TIME STAMP OF THREE TWELVE PM TODAY LITTLE SEE IN SECTION TWENTY SEVEN SAYS ELECTRIC CORPORATION MAY APPLY FOR FINANCING OR PURSUANT. TO ARTICLE FIVE POINT EIGHT CHAPTER FOR THE AMOUNT EXPENSES ALLOCATE TO THE REPAIR AS JUST AND REASONABLE OR AS WELL DISALLOWED FOR RECOVERY. BUT EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT DETERMINED PURSUANT TO SUBSECTION BE -- ALSO I WOULD REFER TO A BELIEVES REFER TO AS A STRESS TEST. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THAT NOT THEY ALLOWED ANY WHEN THEY'RE THAT WOMEN OR BALLOTS THAT WERE DISALLOWED FOR SOME OTHER REASON INCLUDING POTENTIALLY THE NEGLIGENCE OR IMPRUDENCE. OF THE UTILITY -- BEING ALLOWED TO BE PUT BACK ON THE RATE PAYERS AND FOR THAT REASON AND OTHERS THAT WE MAY HAVE YET TO UNCOVER -- WE DO YOU OPPOSE THIS MOTION THINKS. MICHAEL BOGOTA ARE ON BEHALF OF THE AGRICULTURAL ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION ALL SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT MISTER. CHARGES SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE WE TO DO NOT BELIEVE THIS GOES ANYWHERE NEAR FAR ENOUGH TO PROTECT RATEPAYERS. EVEN WHEN THE UTILITIES NEGLIGENT OUR COMPANIES WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THERE BEING NEGLIGENT ARE GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK. POTENTIALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LIABILITY AND THAT'S JUST FRANKLY NOT FAIR OR RIGHT OR JUST I THINK AS YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THE OTHER UTILITIES AND WE'LL HEAR FROM THE REST OF UTILITIES. THEY DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR AND JUST EITHER THANK YOU. GERMAN WAS WITH HUNTERS WITH THE WESTERN SYNCHROTRON ASSOCIATION ECHOING THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM C. MTA AND MISTER BOOK ADORO.

THIS SECURITIZATION SPREADING OUT THE COST FOR RATEPAYERS CAN ALSO BE DONE FIRST SHAREHOLDERS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN SPREAD OUT THE COST NOT JUST FOR RATEPAYERS.

HE OTHER DISCUSSION YEAH I THOUGHT I'D LIKE OTHER JUST POSIT THAT. YOU NO GIVEN ALL THE CONDITIONS HERE -- IT SHOULDN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE YOU CAN FIX OR EXCLUDE ANYTHING USING THE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT ARE THERE SO -- I I KNOW WE'RE HAVING A BIG DISPUTE ABOUT IT AT THIS TIME I AT THIS HOUR. AND I'M NOT PARTICULARLY HAPPY WITH THIS WHOLE PROCESS BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT IN TIME -- IT MAY I WAS. YOU KNOW YOU SAY -- IS A MORE FLEXIBLE APPROACH AND SO I WILL I WILL NOT SUPPORT THE CHANGE IN THE MEMBER BUT I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE. THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED. THIS DOES IN FACT GIVE THE DETERMINING BODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE VALUE JUDGMENTS -- THAT -- WHETHER YOU USE THE WORD SHALL OR USE THE WORD MAY IF YOU HAVE THE WORD SHALL. AND IT'S AS WELL THEY HAVE TO DO IT IF THEY FIND THESE TWELVE FACTORS. THEY COULD EASILY SAY WELL WE DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO THAT SO WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND IN THOSE TWELVE FACTOR SO I'M NOT SURE YOU REALLY ACCOMPLISHING. WHAT YOU WANT HERE THAT'S MY LAWYER HAPPENED FOR YOU KNOW THIS JOB DOESN'T PAY ENOUGH ON THE HOURLY RATE THAT A LAWYER WOULD CHARGE SO? DON'T HOLD ME TO THAT LEGAL ANALYSIS BALUCHISTAN OFF THE TOP MY AND MISTER CHAIR IF I CAN JUST SPEAK TO IT. RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THE GOAL OF THIS WAS TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL. OF CERTAINTY WITHOUT CREATING A MORAL HAZARD. AND WHILE I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE THIS LANGUAGE THAT WE GOT CAME TO US. JUST MINUTES BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IN FACT IS AS WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE COMING IN AND DROPPING LANGUAGE OFF NOW. WE LIKE TO SPEAK OF A TRANSPARENT PROCESS -- BUT AS A COMMITTEE NOT ONE TIME HAVE WE EVER HAD A TRUE MARK UP SESSION ON THIS TO FIND OUT WHETHER THIS COMMITTEE A MAJORITY OF THIS COMMITTEE ACTUALLY APPROVE THE LANGUAGE BEFORE US. THE TRUTH IS THIS LANGUAGE WAS DONE IN A BACK ROOM. MY GUESS IS THIS LANGUAGE WAS DONE BY STAFF WITHOUT MEMBER IMPORT OR VERY LITTLE MEMBER INPUT ON WHAT WAS BEFORE US THAT IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING I GOTTA TELL YOU. AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL SOMEBODY THAT SPENT. AN ENTIRE OPEC ALMOST TO A LIFE FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO RUN FOR OFFICE TO CAMPAIGN TO COME UP HERE AND I THINK THAT ON ELECTED INDIVIDUALS ARE RIDING THIS WITHOUT ANY ABILITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO OPINE. AND THIS THE FIRST TIME I'VE OFFERED UP LANGUAGE AND IT'S ONE WORD FROM MAY. TO SHALL THAT PROVIDES HIGHER LEVEL OF CERTAINTY BEFORE THIS GETS THE P. YOU SEE AND APPRECIATE A VOTE ON THIS AMENDMENT [inaudible] IT'S REYES. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT STAFF PREPARED THE FIRST DRAFT AND IT WAS. REFERRED TO AS THE STAFF DRAFT. I TOOK THE TIME TO GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE PAGE. I DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY ELSE DID I WANT TO EVERY SINGLE PAGE IN THE DRAFT AND I MADE MY COMMENTS. SOME WERE INCLUDED SOME OR NOT BUT WHAT WE HAVE HERE. INCLUDING THE VERY WORD THAT YOU WANT TO CHANGE IS SOMETHING THAT WAS RECOMMENDED. AFTER MY REVIEW [inaudible] IT'S A I'M. I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE IS WE HAVE TO HAVE. THREE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FIRST YOU'VE GOT ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOTE. IS THE IS THAT ACCURATE I'M A DIFFERENCE FOR YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF THREE SENATORS. SO A YOU PUT UP THE MOST AYE I DISLIKE. TO SEE IF THERE'S THREE VOTES ON THE ASSEMBLY BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER.

I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE BEFORE US. REPRESENTS THE BEST THAT WE COULD DO. AS A COMMITTEE TO AS A COMMITTEE TODAY. AND WELL I DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT ONE SITUATION I LOOK AT THE WHOLE PACKAGE. IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT ENCOURAGING THAT THE RATE PAYERS AND UTILITIES -- HAVE BOTH HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS -- SO -- IT IS WHAT IT IS -- WE'VE GOTTA MOVE ON IT WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES -- AS WE DO HERE IN BOTH OF OUR HOUSES TO ADVANCED POLICIES IN THE FUTURE IF -- THE MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE BEST WAY OF GOING.
