00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:46.886 region:rollup2
THERE IS SOMETHING SOCIALLY

00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:48.254 region:rollup2
UNACCEPTABLE ABOUT THAT.

00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:49.955 region:rollup2
IN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS NO ONE

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:52.858 region:rollup2

QUALIFY.

00:21:03.496 --> 00:21:06.132 region:rollup2
FOR AND EVEN GIVEN MEDICATION

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.600 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD PROBABLY CAUSE

00:21:06.132 --> 00:21:09.668 region:rollup2
BLINDNESS ALL OF THIS TO STOP

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.302 region:rollup2

00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:25.918 region:rollup2
THE DOCTORS TOLD US OUR SON

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:26.519 region:rollup2

00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:33.692 region:rollup2
MY HUSBAND CALLED SPECIAL CALLED

TRY CANNABIS AND I WAS

00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:37.563 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY AGAINST IT AND

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:39.465 region:rollup2
THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY.

00:21:37.563 --> 00:21:41.033 region:rollup2
AS A NURSE I REQUIRE EVIDENCE

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:42.168 region:rollup2

I AM INTERESTED IN THIS AND IN

00:23:45.391 --> 00:23:48.894 region:rollup2
THESE TWO CASES THINK IT'S

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:51.063 region:rollup2
COMPELLING I THINK I'M A LITTLE

00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:52.431 region:rollup2
CONCERNED.

00:23:51.063 --> 00:23:54.233 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT APPEARS --

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:56.035 region:rollup2
THAT THAT I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE

00:23:54.233 --> 00:23:57.636 region:rollup2
OUT HOW A PRESCRIPTION FOR

00:23:56.035 --> 00:23:59.938 region:rollup2
CANNABIS COMES ABOUT THIS HAS

00:23:57.636 --> 00:24:01.106 region:rollup2
BEEN LIKE AT AN ISSUE FOR ME IN

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:02.608 region:rollup2
GENERAL A PRESCRIPTION FOR

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:03.575 region:rollup2
CANNABIS COMES ABOUT BECAUSE WE

00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:04.576 region:rollup2
WANT TO TREAT IT LIKE EVERY

00:24:03.575 --> 00:24:05.711 region:rollup2
OTHER DRUG BUT IT'S NOT

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:06.345 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBED LIKE EVERY OTHER

00:24:05.711 --> 00:24:08.247 region:rollup2
TRACK.

00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:09.648 region:rollup2
AND IT APPEARED FROM I MEAN JUST

00:24:08.247 --> 00:24:11.417 region:rollup2
VERY QUICK RESEARCH I DID.

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:11.984 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY THAT --

00:24:11.417 --> 00:24:13.953 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NO INVOLVEMENT

00:24:11.984 --> 00:24:17.222 region:rollup2
NECESSARY [inaudible]

00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:18.324 region:rollup2
OR THE ATTRITION A CHILDREN'S

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:19.525 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WITH THAT CANNABIS CARD

00:24:18.324 --> 00:24:21.193 region:rollup2
SO I I JUST WONDERED A LITTLE

00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:22.628 region:rollup2
BIT MORE ON HOW YOU DID IT THE

00:24:21.193 --> 00:24:24.596 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ON DOES SEEM.

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:26.098 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IT'S BEING USED FOR

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:27.1000 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WAY

00:24:26.098 --> 00:24:28.901 region:rollup2
OF AN EXTREME CASE IN THIS IS

00:24:27.1000 --> 00:24:30.002 region:rollup2
THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS I GET

00:24:28.901 --> 00:24:30.903 region:rollup2
THAT -- I'M

00:24:30.002 --> 00:24:32.204 region:rollup2
A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE

00:24:30.903 --> 00:24:34.440 region:rollup2
MIGHT --

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:36.508 region:rollup2
LOOK AT CANNABIS AS IT AS A LOT

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.876 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE DO AS A NATURAL REMEDY

00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:39.211 region:rollup2
FOR OTHER THINGS THAT MAY BE A

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:41.413 region:rollup2
PEDIATRICIAN WOULD SUGGEST THAT

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:43.315 region:rollup2
A MORE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE FOR

00:24:41.413 --> 00:24:44.616 region:rollup2
CERTAIN REASONS WITH DOSAGES

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.451 region:rollup2
THAT A PRIEST.

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:46.251 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED --

00:24:45.451 --> 00:24:47.886 region:rollup2
MAKE MORE SENSE AND WHAT KIND OF

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:49.588 region:rollup2
OPENING UP.

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:50.622 region:rollup2
A PANDORA'S BOX SO I'M A LITTLE

00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:51.657 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT HAS JUST

00:24:50.622 --> 00:24:54.126 region:rollup2
WONDERING --

00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:55.661 region:rollup2
ON LIKE DOSAGES IN THE DECISIONS

00:24:54.126 --> 00:24:56.195 region:rollup2
AND AND THE INVOLVEMENT IT

00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:57.296 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD SOME

00:24:56.195 --> 00:24:58.864 region:rollup2
INVOLVEMENT OF THE OF THE

00:24:57.296 --> 00:25:00.632 region:rollup2
DOCTORS BUT LIKE HOW THAT'S THAT

00:24:58.864 --> 00:25:01.166 region:rollup2
DECISION IS MADE BECAUSE IT'S

00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:03.235 region:rollup2
NOT A NORMAL PRESCRIPTION

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:05.404 region:rollup2
CRACKED.

00:25:03.235 --> 00:25:06.638 region:rollup2
YEAH RULED LOOK TIME BEFORE I

00:25:05.404 --> 00:25:07.439 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU NEED TO TALK IN THE

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:10.542 region:rollup2
MICROPHONE SO THEY FOR I CAN

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:11.043 region:rollup2
EVEN GET A RECOMMENDATION I HAD

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:11.777 region:rollup2
TO GET MY PEDIATRICIAN'S

00:25:11.043 --> 00:25:13.178 region:rollup2
APPROVAL.

00:25:11.777 --> 00:25:14.113 region:rollup2
SO HE HAD TO GIVE ME A DOCUMENT

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:15.014 region:rollup2
THAT I COULD TAKE THAT KIND OF

00:25:14.113 --> 00:25:16.215 region:rollup2
THIS DOCTOR BEFORE HE EVEN

00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:18.417 region:rollup2
LICENSE STATUS.

00:25:16.215 --> 00:25:19.551 region:rollup2
IN IS APPLE THAT'S NOT THE LAW

00:25:18.417 --> 00:25:21.887 region:rollup2

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:24.289 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WHO GAVE THE CAMPUS CARD.

00:25:21.887 --> 00:25:26.058 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS DOCTOR

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:28.694 region:rollup2
WANTED TO BE ABLE TO TREAT A

00:25:26.058 --> 00:25:30.229 region:rollup2
MINOR AND GIVE HIM A CANNABIS

00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:32.197 region:rollup2

HIS PEDIATRICIAN ON BOARD I HAD

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:35.968 region:rollup2
TO HAVE IT ON A LETTERHEAD

CONCERN YOU HAVE WHICH IS THE

00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:32.778 region:rollup2
SAME CONCERN THAT CHEN RAISED IN

00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:33.979 region:rollup2
HER SKEPTICISM OF THE ECHO OF

THAT I WOULD BE CONSIDERED

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:41.887 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THOUGHT FRANKLY ANYONE

CAN GET UP A PRESCRIPTION OR A

00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:44.489 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION FROM A DOCTOR IN

THAT -- I'VE

00:28:53.198 --> 00:28:57.035 region:rollup2
LEARNED A LOT I WOULD JUST HATE

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:58.637 region:rollup2
A SITUATION BY WHICH AND NOT

00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:59.504 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT PARENTS CAN'T

00:28:58.637 --> 00:29:00.272 region:rollup2
PARENT THEIR CHILDREN BUT WE'VE

00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:01.340 region:rollup2
WE'VE.

00:29:00.272 --> 00:29:02.908 region:rollup2
MADE A LOT OF DECISIONS FOR

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.810 region:rollup2
PARENTS WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL

00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:06.211 region:rollup2
DECISIONS --

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.679 region:rollup2
VACCINES BEING THE MOST OBVIOUS

00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:09.781 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE PARENTS WHO WHO

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:10.816 region:rollup2
MAY DECIDE JUST WITH A CARD THAT

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:12.718 region:rollup2
THEY ARE DOING.

00:29:10.816 --> 00:29:14.186 region:rollup2
AND THE PROTOCOLS THEMSELVES AND

00:29:12.718 --> 00:29:16.655 region:rollup2
I I WOULDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:29:14.186 --> 00:29:18.557 region:rollup2
WITH WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF

00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:20.826 region:rollup2
A PEDIATRICIAN OR A DOCTOR THAT

00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:22.327 region:rollup2

WHETHER IT'S WHAT DOES THAT MAKE

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:40.212 region:rollup2

CANNABIS DOCTOR FOR ANY REASON

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:57.622 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.957 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IF YOUR PRIMARY CARE

00:30:57.622 --> 00:31:00.292 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN BECAUSE HE'S DOCTORS

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:01.426 region:rollup2
WILL GIVE YOU RECOMMENDATIONS

00:31:00.292 --> 00:31:02.894 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFERENT FOR CHILDREN BUT

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:04.763 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT'S NOT

00:31:02.894 --> 00:31:06.898 region:rollup2
THE LAW THAT MIGHT BE THE

00:31:04.763 --> 00:31:07.966 region:rollup2
PRACTICE OF MY WRONG ON THAT.

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:10.035 region:rollup2
MY MISREADING THE LAW ONLY

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:12.671 region:rollup2
CERTAIN CANNABIS RECOMMENDATION

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:16.108 region:rollup2
DOCTORS TREAT LIKE THEY'RE THEY

00:31:12.671 --> 00:31:17.609 region:rollup2
DON'T ALL DIFFERENT.

00:31:16.108 --> 00:31:18.777 region:rollup2
SENIOR CLASS YOU ARE LIKELY

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:20.345 region:rollup2
THOUGH TO TAINT YOUR QUESTION.

00:31:18.777 --> 00:31:21.546 region:rollup2
TO GET A CANNABIS CARD WHICH I

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:24.182 region:rollup2
THINK IS YOUR ISSUE.

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:25.517 region:rollup2
JUST NEEDS A PHYSICIAN TO SAY SO

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:26.084 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE THERE ARE MINOR

00:31:25.517 --> 00:31:27.386 region:rollup2
APPROACH PARENTAL PERMISSION

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:29.888 region:rollup2
EVER.

00:31:27.386 --> 00:31:31.890 region:rollup2
YES SO IT HE'D IT IS OPENING UP

00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:33.191 region:rollup2
IF DOCTORS ARE TAKING AMONGST

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.427 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE

00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:38.230 region:rollup2
NOT ISSUING THOSE. TO MINORS

00:31:35.427 --> 00:31:39.531 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A PEDIATRICIAN THEN.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.767 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU HAVE SOME

00:31:39.531 --> 00:31:42.367 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS THERE IF NOT.

00:31:41.767 --> 00:31:44.169 region:rollup2
THEN THE THE ISSUE RAISING IS

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:45.971 region:rollup2
IS.

00:31:44.169 --> 00:31:47.305 region:rollup2
AT ADDRESSING ISSUES.

00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:50.375 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE IT'S NOT THE PART I

00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:50.909 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO PREVENT --

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:51.977 region:rollup2
YOUR CHILD FROM STARTING

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:54.846 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN WITH.

00:31:51.977 --> 00:31:56.915 region:rollup2
A NORMAL KIND OF SITUATION SO --

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:57.916 region:rollup2
I I HOPE WE CAN WORK ON THIS

00:31:56.915 --> 00:32:00.051 region:rollup2
ASPECT I WOULD JUST FEEL MUCH

00:31:57.916 --> 00:32:00.886 region:rollup2
MORE COMFORTABLE IF IT IF IT

00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:02.921 region:rollup2
CAME WITH.

00:32:00.886 --> 00:32:05.257 region:rollup2
THE RECOMMENDATION OF A

00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:07.292 region:rollup2
PEDIATRICIAN --

00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:08.660 region:rollup2
AS WELL YOU KNOW WELL THAT'S

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:11.229 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU HAD I HAD TO GET THAT

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.397 region:rollup2
BEFORE I EVEN KNOW ABLE TO YEAH

00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:15.467 region:rollup2
OF THE CANNABIS CARD FOR WHO I

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:17.569 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND MY DOCTOR HAD THE

00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:22.941 region:rollup2
SIGGRAPH HITTING A PAYER.

00:32:17.569 --> 00:32:23.442 region:rollup2
SO IT IS NOT TIME FOR BACK AND

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:24.943 region:rollup2
FORTH AS A COVER ANSWER

00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:27.846 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:28.480 region:rollup2
SO I THAT'S UNDERSTAND THINK THE

00:32:27.846 --> 00:32:29.214 region:rollup2
INTERNET AND ALSO JUST WANT TO

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.549 region:rollup2
POINT OUT IF I COULD MISTER

00:32:29.214 --> 00:32:31.483 region:rollup2
CHAIR THAT THAT --

00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:32.050 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IF IF THIS BILL WERE

00:32:31.483 --> 00:32:32.851 region:rollup2
TO BECOME LAW LOCAL SCHOOL

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.785 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS CAN ADD THIS IS A

00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:34.786 region:rollup2
POLICY IF THEY'D LIKE IF THEY

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:35.420 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT AND

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:37.823 region:rollup2
NECESSARY AS WELL AS PART OF

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:40.559 region:rollup2
THEIR OF THE TERMS AND

00:32:37.823 --> 00:32:40.992 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS ITS GOING TO APPLY TO

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:43.829 region:rollup2
WHAT WE COULD HAVE.

00:32:40.992 --> 00:32:45.297 region:rollup2
WE CAN APPLY ISSUE OF AND AS

00:32:43.829 --> 00:32:46.331 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:48.266 region:rollup2
WITNESSES IN.

00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:50.702 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY MOST CASES OF BEFORE

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:52.370 region:rollup2
OF A REGULAR PHYSICIAN WOULD

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:53.672 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND CANNABIS TO A MINOR HE

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.873 region:rollup2
WOULD WANT TO RECEIVE HER SHE

00:32:53.672 --> 00:32:57.442 region:rollup2
WOULD WANT TO RECEIVE SOME.

00:32:54.873 --> 00:32:58.643 region:rollup2
SOME SOME PRESCRIPTION OR SOME.

00:32:57.442 --> 00:33:00.645 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION FROM --

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:01.913 region:rollup2
THAT THE CHILD'S PEDIATRICIAN TO

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:03.181 region:rollup2
SEE AND THAT SEEMS TO BE

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:05.417 region:rollup2
STANDARD PRACTICE FROM WHICH IT

00:33:03.181 --> 00:33:06.685 region:rollup2
IS NOT IN LAW BUT IT SEEMS TO BE

00:33:05.417 --> 00:33:06.952 region:rollup2
THE PRACTICE.

00:33:06.685 --> 00:33:08.220 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:33:06.952 --> 00:33:10.589 region:rollup2
MISTER KALRA.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.323 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISS SURE I'M I HAVE

00:33:10.589 --> 00:33:12.023 region:rollup2
AND BY ONE OF THE FEW AREAS

00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:13.458 region:rollup2
WHERE.

00:33:12.023 --> 00:33:15.427 region:rollup2
I DIFFER A LITTLE BIT FROM MY

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:18.230 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE ON HOW WE APPROACH

00:33:15.427 --> 00:33:19.798 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE --

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.565 region:rollup2
AYE FIRST OF ALL I THINK THIS IS

00:33:19.798 --> 00:33:21.933 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO BE A FEDERAL

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:24.069 region:rollup2
FAILURE --

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:25.971 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO TREAT CALABASAS.

00:33:24.069 --> 00:33:28.340 region:rollup2
I A N. AND THE WAY THAT IT'S

00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:28.974 region:rollup2
TREATED AND THAT'S UNDER THE

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.208 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND THE

00:33:28.974 --> 00:33:31.610 region:rollup2
CURRENT ONE SO IT'S NOT A

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:32.177 region:rollup2
PARTISAN THING I THINK THAT.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.879 region:rollup2
REALLY --

00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:35.780 region:rollup2
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

00:33:33.879 --> 00:33:37.382 region:rollup2
NOT ACTED --

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.817 region:rollup2
AND TREATED CANNABIS WAY THAT IT

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:40.719 region:rollup2
SHOULD TO ALLOW FOR PROPER

00:33:38.817 --> 00:33:42.387 region:rollup2
RESEARCH ALLOW FOR PROPER USE

00:33:40.719 --> 00:33:46.625 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER MEDICINE.

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:48.360 region:rollup2
AND THE REALITY IS THAT THIS.

00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:50.228 region:rollup2
AS BILL WHICH I FULLY SUPPORT --

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.664 region:rollup2
IT.

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:53.865 region:rollup2
THE TREATS CANNABIS STRICTER

00:33:52.664 --> 00:33:55.400 region:rollup2
THAN PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:56.968 region:rollup2
THAT ARE MUCH MORE DANGEROUS AND

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.570 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE SEVERE.

00:33:56.968 --> 00:34:01.573 region:rollup2
THAN CANNABIS UP FOR CHILDREN

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:03.375 region:rollup2
AND LOOK YOU KNOW I HAVE I THINK

00:34:01.573 --> 00:34:04.910 region:rollup2
IT'S BECOME WELL DOCUMENTED IN

00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:06.211 region:rollup2
RECENT YEARS.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:08.179 region:rollup2
THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF

00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:09.581 region:rollup2
CANNABIS UPON OUR CHILDREN AND

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.649 region:rollup2
ADULTS REGARDING SEIZURES WHICH

00:34:09.581 --> 00:34:12.584 region:rollup2
IS GREAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IN

00:34:10.649 --> 00:34:12.784 region:rollup2
SOME CASES THERE WAS NOTHING

00:34:12.584 --> 00:34:14.553 region:rollup2
ELSE.

00:34:12.784 --> 00:34:15.921 region:rollup2
THAT COULD HELP --

00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:16.955 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE

00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:20.125 region:rollup2
PROBABLY A MANY OTHER

00:34:16.955 --> 00:34:21.860 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS ANXIETY EIGHTY HD

00:34:20.125 --> 00:34:23.628 region:rollup2
YOU NAME IT THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.997 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE BEING DRUGGED UP

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:27.032 region:rollup2
WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:29.534 region:rollup2
AB ROTTING ó BETTER THAN OTHER

00:34:27.032 --> 00:34:30.702 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES AND AGAIN THIS IS

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:32.304 region:rollup2
CBD.

00:34:30.702 --> 00:34:34.072 region:rollup2
NOT TEENAGE SEE AS MY COLLEAGUE

00:34:32.304 --> 00:34:36.975 region:rollup2
MENTIONED I DO HAVE A CBD BILL

00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:37.742 region:rollup2
FOR PETS FOR THE SIMPLE REASON

00:34:36.975 --> 00:34:37.976 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THEIR SUB MAKE BEEN

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.611 region:rollup2
RELIEF.

00:34:37.976 --> 00:34:42.247 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN HEAVY NARCOTICS AND

00:34:39.611 --> 00:34:43.715 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION I THINK

00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:46.384 region:rollup2
THAT THAT SHOULD BE.

00:34:43.715 --> 00:34:47.819 region:rollup2
A PROBABLY EXPLORED BY THE THAT

00:34:46.384 --> 00:34:49.654 region:rollup2
THE POSITION AND THE PARENT OF

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:52.724 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

00:34:49.654 --> 00:34:55.927 region:rollup2
BUT NOW I THE THE MY AT MY

00:34:52.724 --> 00:34:57.429 region:rollup2
HESITANCE AND THAT SOME OF THE

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:59.898 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS IS THAT I I REALLY

00:34:57.429 --> 00:35:00.765 region:rollup2
WOULD HESITATE TO CHANGE THE WAY

00:34:59.898 --> 00:35:02.500 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:04.302 region:rollup2
WE HAD TREATED CANNABIS AND

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.937 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT'S REQUIRED TO BE

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:07.772 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GET IT TO THE DISTAL USE

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:08.340 region:rollup2
AS A STATE NOW AS MENTIONED

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:09.975 region:rollup2
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN YOU

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.309 region:rollup2
KNOW.

00:35:09.975 --> 00:35:12.477 region:rollup2
LOCAL SCHOOLS TO MAKE UP THEIR

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:13.945 region:rollup2
OWN RULES AS THEIR CAMPUS IT

00:35:12.477 --> 00:35:15.213 region:rollup2
SAYS GO THERE CAMPUS SAFETY I

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:16.648 region:rollup2
GET THAT.

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:18.083 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD HESITATE AS US AS A

00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:19.484 region:rollup2
STATE TO GO A DIFFERENT

00:35:18.083 --> 00:35:21.219 region:rollup2
DIRECTION THAT WE'VE GONE

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:22.721 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHERE

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:24.689 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR FEDERAL

00:35:22.721 --> 00:35:25.557 region:rollup2
ACTION AT A TIME OR RECREATIONAL

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:27.459 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN.

00:35:25.557 --> 00:35:31.096 region:rollup2
LEGALIZED I THINK THAT HONING IN

00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:31.997 region:rollup2
ON STILL GET MEDICINAL TO THOSE

00:35:31.096 --> 00:35:33.698 region:rollup2
THAT NEED IT THAT THERE'S BEEN

00:35:31.997 --> 00:35:34.966 region:rollup2
SO MUCH TENSION RECREATIONAL OR

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:36.001 region:rollup2
FORGETTING THAT WOULD YOU KNOW

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:36.968 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE STILL PUTTING

00:35:36.001 --> 00:35:39.437 region:rollup2
PEOPLE NEED.

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:41.573 region:rollup2
A BUT WE CANNABIS NEED CB DE UP

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:46.411 region:rollup2
FOR AILMENTS AND I I THINK THAT

00:35:41.573 --> 00:35:47.746 region:rollup2
I'M THIS BILL I I THINK IT IS.

00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:49.314 region:rollup2
BUT AS IT STANDS I FULLY SUPPORT

00:35:47.746 --> 00:35:50.582 region:rollup2
IT I THINK THAT HAVING A PARENT

00:35:49.314 --> 00:35:52.651 region:rollup2
OR GUARDIAN COME ON TO THE

00:35:50.582 --> 00:35:54.686 region:rollup2
CAMPUS ADMINISTER AND THEN LEAVE

00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:56.287 region:rollup2
THE CAMPUS WITH THE CANNABIS --

00:35:54.686 --> 00:35:57.689 region:rollup2
IS AS RESPONSIBLE WAY AS IT

00:35:56.287 --> 00:35:59.257 region:rollup2
COULD BE.

00:35:57.689 --> 00:36:00.091 region:rollup2
DONE AND MORE RESPONSIBLE THAN

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:02.360 region:rollup2
HOW WE TREAT PRESCRIPTION

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:03.795 region:rollup2
MEDICATION AGAIN THAT CAN BE

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.797 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE SEVERE IN TERMS OF HOW

00:36:03.795 --> 00:36:07.899 region:rollup2
IT IMPACTS BOTH MENTALLY AND

00:36:05.797 --> 00:36:08.967 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY AT A A MINOR.

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:10.702 region:rollup2
SOMEONE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF

00:36:08.967 --> 00:36:13.304 region:rollup2
BEING HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION.

00:36:10.702 --> 00:36:14.372 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SECARA.

00:36:13.304 --> 00:36:15.673 region:rollup2
SO SAID I THINK WHAT I THINK

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:16.741 region:rollup2
YOU'RE HEARING HERE IS IS A

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:18.376 region:rollup2
CONCERN OF MINE THAT WITH THIS

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:19.811 region:rollup2
BILL I THINK THIS THAT YOU'RE

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:22.680 region:rollup2
MOVING THIS FORWARD.

00:36:19.811 --> 00:36:23.682 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO WORRY WHEN WHERE WE

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.949 region:rollup2
HAVE A CULTURE OF OVER

00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:26.384 region:rollup2
MEDICATING CHILDREN.

AND WE MEDICAID CHILDREN FOR OUR

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:29.854 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FOR THE SCHOOL'S BENEFIT

00:36:27.886 --> 00:36:30.989 region:rollup2
NOT FOR THE CHILD'S BENEFIT

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:31.256 region:rollup2
THERE'S OF TOO LONG OF HISTORY

00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:33.958 region:rollup2

FACILITATING THAT BUT TO THE

00:36:35.393 --> 00:36:39.431 region:rollup2
POINT THAT IT BECOMES TOO EASY

00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:40.865 region:rollup2
TO MEDICAID A CHILD FOR THE

00:36:47.005 --> 00:36:49.574 region:rollup2
NEED TO CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR

00:36:49.007 --> 00:36:51.209 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA'S COMMON INTERESTS

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:03.968 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS.

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:05.636 region:rollup2
IS NOT AN EASY ONE TO GET YOUR

00:50:03.968 --> 00:50:07.438 region:rollup2
ARMS AND YOUR BRAINS AROUND.

00:50:05.636 --> 00:50:10.341 region:rollup2

00:50:07.438 --> 00:50:12.343 region:rollup2
HARD A TO TRY TO SORT OUT SOME

00:50:10.341 --> 00:50:14.311 region:rollup2
OF THESE ISSUES.

00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:15.579 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:17.047 region:rollup2
TOPIC OF ELECTIONS BY

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:18.415 region:rollup2
ACCLAMATION HAS COME BEFORE THE

00:50:17.047 --> 00:50:18.983 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:22.319 region:rollup2
THIS IS AT LEAST A THIRD OF

00:50:18.983 --> 00:50:25.322 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FORD --

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:27.157 region:rollup2

AND WERE ACTUALLY IN ON OPPOSE

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:31.996 region:rollup2
POSITION.

00:50:28.726 --> 00:50:33.764 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY ON THIS BILL --

00:50:31.996 --> 00:50:36.834 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NATURE

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:40.371 region:rollup2
OF ACCLAMATION AS OVERRIDING THE

00:50:36.834 --> 00:50:41.872 region:rollup2
OF NATURE OF COMMON INTEREST

00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:44.341 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS WHICH ARE SELF

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:46.944 region:rollup2
GOVERNING INSTITUTIONS SO.

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:48.512 region:rollup2
USING ACCLAMATION AS A TOOL TO

00:50:46.944 --> 00:50:50.080 region:rollup2
SEE BOARD DIRECTORS DOES REMAIN

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:52.016 region:rollup2
A CONCERN FOR US.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.218 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD

00:50:52.016 --> 00:50:57.054 region:rollup2
ON AMENDMENTS --

00:50:54.218 --> 00:50:58.389 region:rollup2

ISSUE AND TO WORK OUT SOME

00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:06.196 region:rollup2
ISSUES AROUND NOTICE.

00:51:03.294 --> 00:51:07.898 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THE BILL IS

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:09.667 region:rollup2
HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:10.968 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL WORK

00:51:09.667 --> 00:51:13.170 region:rollup2
MORE TO BE DONE.

00:51:10.968 --> 00:51:15.573 region:rollup2
OF SO WE HAVE MODERATED OUR

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:17.007 region:rollup2

00:51:15.573 --> 00:51:19.043 region:rollup2
THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES CAN BE

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:20.711 region:rollup2

BEACH WHAT HOMEOWNERS

00:51:55.279 --> 00:51:57.414 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION WHICH IS MURDER

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:59.016 region:rollup2
SAID.

00:51:57.414 --> 00:52:03.053 region:rollup2
IS THE ONLY PUBLISHED OPINION ON

00:51:59.016 --> 00:52:04.154 region:rollup2
THE IT TO ELECTION PROCESS --

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:04.989 region:rollup2
MIGHT FIRM DOES REPRESENT MANY

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:06.690 region:rollup2
DISSENTING HOMEOWNERS OF THESE

00:52:04.989 --> 00:52:08.258 region:rollup2
ISSUES DO COME UP MORE OFTEN

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:09.960 region:rollup2
THAN THAN YOU MAY THINK.

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:11.829 region:rollup2
AND THE ISSUE I WANTED --

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.429 region:rollup2
TO DRESSED TO THE THE COMMITTEE

00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:13.697 region:rollup2
TODAY IS THE ACCLAMATION ISSUE

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:16.600 region:rollup2
--

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:18.002 region:rollup2
THE STATED GOAL IS TO IS THAT

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.769 region:rollup2
ARE DEEMED UNNECESSARY.

00:52:18.002 --> 00:52:19.937 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:52:18.769 --> 00:52:21.839 region:rollup2
MISNOMER BECAUSE IN THE

00:52:19.937 --> 00:52:23.173 region:rollup2
ACCLIMATION PROCESS THERE

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:24.375 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IS AN ELECTION IT'S

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:26.243 region:rollup2
HELD EXCLUSIVELY BY SEATED BOARD

00:52:24.375 --> 00:52:27.978 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:29.413 region:rollup2
IT'S A VOTE UP BUT IT'S A VOTE

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:31.582 region:rollup2
DONE WITHOUT A BALLOT.

00:52:29.413 --> 00:52:33.484 region:rollup2
SO THE ISSUE IS HOW IMPORTANT IS

00:52:31.582 --> 00:52:35.119 region:rollup2
A BALLOT TO THE LEGITIMACY OF

00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:36.253 region:rollup2
THE ELECTION PROCESS AND I WOULD

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:37.821 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT.

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:38.756 region:rollup2
IT IS QUITE IMPORTANT --

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:40.591 region:rollup2
WE START WITH THE PREMISE THAT

00:52:38.756 --> 00:52:42.326 region:rollup2
H. AWAYS ARE BECAUSE I

00:52:40.591 --> 00:52:43.861 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES MANY CASES

00:52:42.326 --> 00:52:45.763 region:rollup2
HAVE SO HELD.

00:52:43.861 --> 00:52:46.730 region:rollup2
AND AT SUCH A TO A BOARD ENGAGE

00:52:45.763 --> 00:52:48.232 region:rollup2
IN CONDUCT CONSTITUTES MATTERS

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:50.167 region:rollup2
OF PUBLIC INTEREST THE THINGS

00:52:48.232 --> 00:52:50.868 region:rollup2
THEY DO.

00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:53.370 region:rollup2
THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE

00:52:50.868 --> 00:52:54.171 region:rollup2
MEMBERS HOMES --

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.539 region:rollup2
SAID IN ANGER BALLOT VOTE ON

00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:57.141 region:rollup2
MEMBERS THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT

00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:58.509 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY MEMBERS HOMES CAN LEAD

00:52:57.141 --> 00:53:00.144 region:rollup2
TO VIOLATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL

00:52:58.509 --> 00:53:01.945 region:rollup2
OR AT THE VERY LEAST BECAUSE

00:53:00.144 --> 00:53:03.447 region:rollup2
THEY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS --

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:04.982 region:rollup2
MORE PORTLY I THINK IT OPENS THE

00:53:03.447 --> 00:53:06.650 region:rollup2
DOOR TO ASSOCIATION BOARDS BEING

00:53:04.982 --> 00:53:08.519 region:rollup2
ABLE TO STRIP THEIR OPPONENTS A

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:08.786 region:rollup2
VOTING RIGHTS WHICH AFFECTS THE

00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:09.753 region:rollup2
EQUITY --

00:53:08.786 --> 00:53:11.655 region:rollup2
THE FAIRNESS IN THE INTEGRITY OF

00:53:09.753 --> 00:53:15.025 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS IT ALSO AFFECTS THE

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:16.660 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO DO WRITE IN VOTES --

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:18.629 region:rollup2
AND IT ADDS IN AT A MECHANISM TO

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.229 region:rollup2
QUELL DISSENTING VIEWS --

00:53:18.629 --> 00:53:20.297 region:rollup2
AND ALL THIS BEING DONE UNDER

00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:24.068 region:rollup2
THE AUSPICES OF COST SAVINGS I

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:25.035 region:rollup2
THINK CAN BE SEEN AS CHILLING

00:53:24.068 --> 00:53:27.771 region:rollup2
THE VOTING PROCESS IN SOME

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:29.206 region:rollup2
INSTANCES.

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:31.108 region:rollup2
BOB CORDY THE LEGISLATIVE

00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:31.709 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF US TO LOOK AT FIFTY

00:53:31.108 --> 00:53:33.243 region:rollup2
ONE OH FIVE WHICH AT THE TIME

00:53:31.709 --> 00:53:34.978 region:rollup2
WAS THIRTEEN SIXTY THREE POINT

00:53:33.243 --> 00:53:36.113 region:rollup2
OF THREE IT WAS ENACTED TO

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:37.481 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE

00:53:36.113 --> 00:53:39.249 region:rollup2
VOTING PROCESS AND BASED UPON

00:53:37.481 --> 00:53:41.085 region:rollup2
FINDINGS.

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:42.219 region:rollup2
YEAH IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE

00:53:41.085 --> 00:53:43.620 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS BOARD MEMBERS WERE

00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:44.621 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATED BY OPPRESSION

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.291 region:rollup2
MANIPULATION AND INTIMIDATION OF

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:48.392 region:rollup2
MEMBERS I'VE HANDLED MANY CASES

00:53:47.291 --> 00:53:50.427 region:rollup2
WHERE I'VE SEEN THOSE THINGS

00:53:48.392 --> 00:53:51.995 region:rollup2
HAPPEN FIRST HANDED THOSE THOSE

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:53.297 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE REALIZADO.

00:53:51.995 --> 00:53:55.299 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION

00:53:53.297 --> 00:53:56.767 region:rollup2
REGARDING ACCLAMATION PORTION I

00:53:55.299 --> 00:53:58.035 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IS A STEP BACKWARDS

00:53:56.767 --> 00:53:59.503 region:rollup2
UNDER THE AUSPICES OF COST

00:53:58.035 --> 00:54:01.038 region:rollup2
SAVINGS AND I THINK THAT CAN BE

00:53:59.503 --> 00:54:01.605 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS SO WITH THAT I WOULD

00:54:01.038 --> 00:54:03.006 region:rollup2
SUBMIT MY COMMENTS THANK YOU

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:06.076 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH.

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:07.044 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND ALSO OPPOSITION.

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:08.712 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SING NONE OF BRING IT

00:54:07.044 --> 00:54:10.547 region:rollup2
BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:12.116 region:rollup2
OR COMMENTS AND THIS FOR THE

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:13.417 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE

00:54:12.116 --> 00:54:14.685 region:rollup2
SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF CENTER

00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:17.387 region:rollup2
WIECKOWSKI SPILL THAT WE'LL SEE

00:54:14.685 --> 00:54:18.088 region:rollup2
LATER ON BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:18.689 region:rollup2
THESE ARE.

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:20.190 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD THAT THEY

00:54:18.689 --> 00:54:21.525 region:rollup2
CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE WE WERE

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.226 region:rollup2
ABLE TO HARMONIZE SOME OF THE

00:54:21.525 --> 00:54:25.963 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS [inaudible]

00:54:22.226 --> 00:54:27.364 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

00:54:25.963 --> 00:54:29.333 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFICULT TO LOOK AT

00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:31.101 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION.

00:54:29.333 --> 00:54:33.270 region:rollup2
AS A GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY BECAUSE

00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:35.806 region:rollup2
IT IS SEEMS OPERATE MORE LIKE A

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:37.341 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT BUT YET BECAUSE THESE

00:54:35.806 --> 00:54:38.809 region:rollup2
ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LIVING

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:40.711 region:rollup2
THERE IT'S THEIR HOME WHO WERE.

00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:41.845 region:rollup2
MAKING THE DECISION TO TO MOVE

00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:43.514 region:rollup2
INTO A LOCATION LIKE THEY WOULD

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:45.182 region:rollup2
A CITY THAT THAT HAS THESE

00:54:43.514 --> 00:54:47.584 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SETS OF RULES.

00:54:45.182 --> 00:54:48.152 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:49.686 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT THEM A LITTLE BIT

00:54:48.152 --> 00:54:51.421 region:rollup2
MORE.

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:53.190 region:rollup2
IN THE WAY THAT A A LOCAL AGENCY

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:55.526 region:rollup2
WOULD WORK.

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:56.460 region:rollup2
AND WHILE IN CITIES COUNTIES AND

00:54:55.526 --> 00:54:59.196 region:rollup2
OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IF

00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:00.898 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE. TO

00:54:59.196 --> 00:55:02.766 region:rollup2
QUALIFY FOR ELECTION IT'S IN A

00:55:00.898 --> 00:55:03.066 region:rollup2
POOR BECAUSE SAVING MESSAGE

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:04.601 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:05.936 region:rollup2
METHOD.

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:07.037 region:rollup2
TO DEEMED THOSE PEOPLE THAT

00:55:05.936 --> 00:55:08.672 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY APPOINTED TO THE

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:10.307 region:rollup2
BOARD.

00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:11.775 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE HOWEVER SO BUT FOR

00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:14.011 region:rollup2
CITIES COUNTIES THEY'RE VERY

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:14.511 region:rollup2
VERY FEW IF ANY RESTRICTIONS ON

00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:15.979 region:rollup2
WHO CAN STAND FOR THOSE

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:18.015 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS.

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:19.883 region:rollup2
IN THESE CASES THE BOARD ITSELF

00:55:18.015 --> 00:55:23.187 region:rollup2
HAS THE ABILITY TO CREATE

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:24.988 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS ON WHO IS ELIGIBLE.

00:55:23.187 --> 00:55:26.523 region:rollup2
TO BE TO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:27.858 region:rollup2
DIRECTORS AND ND THROUGH

00:55:26.523 --> 00:55:30.060 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL THE POTENTIAL

00:55:27.858 --> 00:55:31.728 region:rollup2
MANIPULATION OF WHO'S ELIGIBLE.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:34.064 region:rollup2
THAT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY THEN

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:35.432 region:rollup2
TO NARROW THE THOUGH THE FOCUS

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:37.100 region:rollup2
HAVE WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO SIT ON

00:55:35.432 --> 00:55:39.703 region:rollup2
A BOARD.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:41.772 region:rollup2
THAT'S KIND OF THE HEART OF THE

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:43.106 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES THAT THAT I HAD WITH

00:55:41.772 --> 00:55:43.740 region:rollup2
THIS AND I APPRECIATE SENATE

00:55:43.106 --> 00:55:44.908 region:rollup2
ROTH BEING WILLING TO WORK WITH

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.210 region:rollup2
US.

00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:46.777 region:rollup2
THROUGH THOSE ISSUES I THINK WE

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:47.845 region:rollup2
HAVE ULTIMATELY NO STANDING

00:55:46.777 --> 00:55:49.413 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:47.845 --> 00:55:50.214 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION TO ADD TO

00:55:49.413 --> 00:55:52.916 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS BUT I

00:55:50.214 --> 00:55:54.451 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:56.820 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS DO NEED

00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:58.589 region:rollup2
TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY WHERE

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.390 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S APPROPRIATE AND WE

00:55:58.589 --> 00:56:01.258 region:rollup2
ALSO YOU HAVE SERVED BICU HAVE

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.626 region:rollup2
VERY LARGE HOMEOWNERS

00:56:01.258 --> 00:56:04.394 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION.

00:56:02.626 --> 00:56:06.096 region:rollup2
WE ALSO NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:07.831 region:rollup2
CRAFTING STATE LA TO ADDRESS

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:09.333 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT MIGHT EXIST THERE

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:11.134 region:rollup2
AND I APPLAUD.

00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:12.569 region:rollup2
YOUR DESIRE TO REDUCE THE COST

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:14.171 region:rollup2
ON YOUR RESIDENTS BUT WE HAVE TO

00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:14.738 region:rollup2
BE CAREFUL ACROSS THE STATE

00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:15.372 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE MANY DIFFERENT

00:56:14.738 --> 00:56:16.807 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS THOSE ASIAN.

00:56:15.372 --> 00:56:18.709 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT FACILITIES THAT

00:56:16.807 --> 00:56:20.043 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO APPLY TO AND IN

00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:21.945 region:rollup2
ANY CASE WHERE WE ARE

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:23.981 region:rollup2
RESTRICTING SOMEONE'S.

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:25.716 region:rollup2
ABILITY EVEN A DISSENTING VOICE

00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:26.883 region:rollup2
TO SIT AND VOTE.

00:56:25.716 --> 00:56:28.318 region:rollup2
ON SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS THEM

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:30.654 region:rollup2
SO DIRECTLY I THINK THAT'S THE

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:31.655 region:rollup2
PART THAT WE HAVE.

00:56:30.654 --> 00:56:33.156 region:rollup2
SO WITH BOTH THIS BILL AND THE

00:56:31.655 --> 00:56:34.391 region:rollup2
WHITE HOUSE KEEP BILL.

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:36.927 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE A VERY CAREFULLY

00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:39.062 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED --

00:56:36.927 --> 00:56:41.265 region:rollup2
DEAL THAT WAS MADE AND SET OF

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:41.565 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MADE AND IF

00:56:41.265 --> 00:56:43.100 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:56:41.565 --> 00:56:45.035 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.770 region:rollup2
IF THESE AMENDMENTS ARE CHANGE

00:56:45.035 --> 00:56:48.972 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PROCESS THEN THIS

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:50.207 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WILL BE BRINGING THIS

00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:52.042 region:rollup2
BILL OR SEMI CASSIE'S BILL IF HE

00:56:50.207 --> 00:56:53.443 region:rollup2
DOES SOMETHING BACK TO MAKE SURE

00:56:52.042 --> 00:56:54.978 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE HARMONIZING THEM

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:56.880 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I THINK WE HAVE.

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:58.181 region:rollup2
A PRETTY GOOD BALANCE HERE WITH

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.783 region:rollup2
THE ALL THE COMPETING INTERESTS

00:56:58.181 --> 00:57:01.251 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE THAT WE ARE

00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:03.020 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO WITH SOMETHING THAT

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:04.521 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN IN THE ISSUE OF OF

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:05.989 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS BACK MASON IS COME UP

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:06.189 region:rollup2
A LOT AND IT'S SOMETHING I THINK

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:08.025 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:09.192 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO NEED. TO FIND A WAY

00:57:08.025 --> 00:57:11.061 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:12.629 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE.

00:57:11.061 --> 00:57:14.798 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE WHERE WE

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:16.133 region:rollup2

BOTH BILLS TO MOVE FORWARD BOTH

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:25.242 region:rollup2

00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:25.976 region:rollup2

NOT ENFORCE CONFIDENTIALITY

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:41.304 region:rollup2
DURING MY EIGHTEEN YEARS OF

REPRESENTING HARASSMENT VICTIMS

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:44.374 region:rollup2
I'VE SEEN A GROWING TREND WHERE

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:45.342 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS INSIST UPON THE

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:47.310 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:49.012 region:rollup2
AGREEING TO A NON DISCLOSURE AND

ORDER TO SETTLE THESE CLAIMS.

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:54.151 region:rollup2
THESE CASES OFTEN INVOLVE A

PERSON IN A POSITION OF POWER OF

01:00:56.987 --> 01:01:00.991 region:rollup2
USING HIS OR HER POSITION TO

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:05.529 region:rollup2
A SEXUAL DEGRADATION HUMILIATION

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:06.763 region:rollup2
AND ADVANCES. ONE WOULD THINK

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:07.964 region:rollup2
THAT STOPPING THIS TYPE OF

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:10.066 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR WOULD BE A PUBLIC

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:11.968 region:rollup2
POLICY CONCERN WHICH WOULD

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:13.436 region:rollup2
NECESSITATE PUBLIC LIGHT. TO

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:15.472 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THIS TYPE OF

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:16.873 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR DOES NOT REOCCUR.

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:18.942 region:rollup2
IT INCREASINGLY DEFENDANTS

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:20.944 region:rollup2
INSIST ON SECRECY SO THAT SO

01:01:18.942 --> 01:01:23.380 region:rollup2
THAT IF A VICTIM WANTS PERSONAL

01:01:20.944 --> 01:01:25.282 region:rollup2
CLOSURE FOR THEIR ORDEAL.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.883 region:rollup2
THEIR FORBIDDEN TO ENGAGE IN ANY

01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:29.219 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO INSURE THAT THE SAME

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:31.054 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR DOESN'T HAPPEN TO

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:32.389 region:rollup2
ANOTHER UNSUSPECTING EMPLOYEE.

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:34.858 region:rollup2
SOME WILL ARGUE THAT SECRET

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:36.993 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:38.061 region:rollup2
EFFECTUATE A SETTLEMENT IN OTHER

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:40.130 region:rollup2
WORDS THE DEFENDANT WILL NEVER

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:41.831 region:rollup2

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:44.267 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AGAIN THIS IS A GROWING

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:46.002 region:rollup2
TREND.

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:47.504 region:rollup2
NOT ALL EMPLOYERS HAVE INSISTED

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:48.838 region:rollup2
ON THIS AND IT USED TO BE

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:50.207 region:rollup2
UNCOMMON AND SETTLEMENTS WERE

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:52.409 region:rollup2
FLUCTUATED.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:53.476 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:56.112 region:rollup2
PROHIBITED SECRET SETTLEMENTS

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:57.981 region:rollup2
AND OTHER CONTACTS SUCH AS

01:01:56.112 --> 01:02:00.083 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE.

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:01.718 region:rollup2
AND OUR MEMBERS REPORT THESE

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:03.620 region:rollup2
CASES DO STILL SUBTLE BUT

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:04.988 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SECRECY.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:06.990 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE SEEN IN REPEATED

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:08.692 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES THE USE OF SECRET

01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:10.160 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENTS HAVE BECOME RAMPANT.

01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:11.661 region:rollup2
AND ALLOW PERPETRATORS TO

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.396 region:rollup2
CONTINUE HARASSMENT WITHOUT ANY

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:14.931 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:16.299 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC POLICY CONCERNS

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:18.435 region:rollup2
REGARDING THIS BEHAVIOR AND THE

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:20.370 region:rollup2
ELEMENT OF DETERMINED DETERRENCE

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:21.905 region:rollup2
IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS CASES MAKE

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:22.572 region:rollup2
CLEAR THE NEED TO ELIMINATE

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.341 region:rollup2
THESE EMPLOYER MANDATED SECRECY

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:25.875 region:rollup2
CAUSES.

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:27.611 region:rollup2
SECRET SETTLEMENTS IN SEX

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:29.112 region:rollup2
OFFENSE CASES ARE MAJOR REASON

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:31.081 region:rollup2
WHY PREDATORS.

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:33.516 region:rollup2
WHETHER WITHIN FOX NEWS HARVEY

SO MANY YEARS.

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:42.559 region:rollup2
CHAU C. STRONGLY BELIEVES THE

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:43.560 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE MUST INTERVENE TO

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:44.995 region:rollup2
SHIFT THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.396 region:rollup2
PARTIES WHO DEMAND SECRECY TO

01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:47.530 region:rollup2
SETTLE A CLAIM.

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:49.399 region:rollup2
AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN

CURBING HARASSMENT AND ENSURING

01:02:49.399 --> 01:02:53.069 region:rollup2

01:05:10.173 --> 01:05:11.574 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE COMMITTEE

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:13.309 region:rollup2
JENNIFER BROWN TO HAVE

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:15.178 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:16.679 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO SB --

01:05:15.178 --> 01:05:17.647 region:rollup2
EIGHT TWENTY WITH REGARDS TO THE

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:19.182 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS ARE THE RECENT

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:20.483 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS.

01:05:19.182 --> 01:05:21.418 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:22.452 region:rollup2
INTERFERE WITH ALL SETTLEMENT

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:23.620 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS AND I'M NOT GOING TO

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:24.621 region:rollup2
SIT HERE AND SUGGEST THAT THAT'S

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.955 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE THE CASE I THINK

01:05:24.621 --> 01:05:27.557 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS THAT GETS INTO THE

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:28.892 region:rollup2
REASON AS TO WHY.

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:30.326 region:rollup2
SETTLE CASES ONE THEY SETTLE

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:31.294 region:rollup2
CARE CASES BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:32.962 region:rollup2
THERE IS MERIT TO THE CASE AND

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:33.797 region:rollup2
WITHOUT REGARD TO THOSE CASES I

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:35.331 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THIS BILL WILL

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:36.566 region:rollup2
IMPACT THOSE EMPLOYERS.

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:38.201 region:rollup2
WHO ARE UP BELIEVE THAT THERE'S

01:05:36.566 --> 01:05:39.969 region:rollup2
LIABILITY EXPOSURE AND OF THAT

01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:41.304 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION AND FIND THAT A

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:42.639 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR HAS ENGAGED IN

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:44.040 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY HARASSING CONDUCT

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:46.142 region:rollup2
ARE LIKELY GOING TO SETTLE THOSE

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.810 region:rollup2
CASES REGARDLESS BECAUSE GOING

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:47.410 region:rollup2
TO TRIAL JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.278 region:rollup2
FOR THEM?

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.013 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE OTHER REASONS WHY

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:51.748 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER SETTLE CASES ARE

01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:52.782 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THEY DON'T.

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:54.584 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:55.752 region:rollup2
THE CASE HAS MERIT BY GOING TO

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:56.519 region:rollup2
COURT AND GOING ALL THE WAY

01:05:55.752 --> 01:05:58.988 region:rollup2
THROUGH TRIAL IS A BUSINESS

01:05:56.519 --> 01:06:00.290 region:rollup2
DECISION IT'S EXPENSIVE AYE IT

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:02.091 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THEM TO PAY FOR THEIR

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:03.593 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS FEES AND PAY FOR ALL

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:04.427 region:rollup2
THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRIAL

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:04.928 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY WILL ENGAGE IN A

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.329 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENT.

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:08.765 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION NOT NECESSARILY

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:09.999 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DON'T.

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:11.501 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S A BUSINESS DECISION

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:13.470 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:15.004 region:rollup2
RESOLVE THE CASE EARLY TO SAY

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:16.339 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY AND TO JUST MOVE ON

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:17.574 region:rollup2
AND IN THOSE CASES WHEN WE

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:19.008 region:rollup2
UTILIZE --

01:06:17.574 --> 01:06:20.343 region:rollup2
EIGHT CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:22.011 region:rollup2
IT IS TO MAINTAIN THE REPUTATION

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:23.346 region:rollup2
OF THE COMPANY IT'S NOT ALWAYS

01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:24.614 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY THAT IS NECESSARILY

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:25.882 region:rollup2
AT FAULT WITH ESPECIALLY IN

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:27.484 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT CASES WHEN IT'S A

01:06:25.882 --> 01:06:29.152 region:rollup2
SUPERVISOR WHO HAS ENGAGED IN

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:30.753 region:rollup2
THE CONDUCT AND THE EMPLOYER HAD

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:31.387 region:rollup2
NO IDEA ABOUT IT UNTIL IT WAS

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:32.789 region:rollup2
REPORTED.

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:33.656 region:rollup2
ITS STRICT LIABILITY NO MATTER

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:34.991 region:rollup2
IF THE EMPLOYER IMMEDIATELY

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:36.593 region:rollup2
TERMINATES THAT INDIVIDUAL ARE

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.827 region:rollup2
NOT AND TAKES IMMEDIATE ACTION

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:39.963 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL LIABLE AND SO

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:41.064 region:rollup2
AGAIN IF THEY RESOLVE THE CASE

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:42.632 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE A CONFIDENTIALITY

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:43.700 region:rollup2
PROVISION IN PLACE TO MAINTAIN

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:45.068 region:rollup2
THE REPUTATION.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:46.135 region:rollup2
THAT'S EFFECTIVE FOR PURPOSES OF

01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:47.704 region:rollup2
THE SETTLEMENT IF THEY CAN NO

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:49.606 region:rollup2
LONGER DO THAT IT WILL ENCOURAGE

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:51.040 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS TO GO TO TRIAL TO MAKE

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:52.775 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THEIR REPUTATION IS IN

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.710 region:rollup2
PLACE AT THE CAN DEFEND THE TO A

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:55.578 region:rollup2
CASE OF TRAVELS.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:56.679 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY BE SUCCESSFUL SO I DO

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:57.347 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE WILL BE SOME

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.314 region:rollup2
INTERFERENCE WITH SOME

01:06:57.347 --> 01:06:59.849 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AS A

01:06:58.314 --> 01:07:02.485 region:rollup2
RESULT OF THIS AND FOR THOSE

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.986 region:rollup2
REASONS WE ARE POST THANK YOU.

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:05.488 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN

01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:07.457 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

01:07:05.488 --> 01:07:07.924 region:rollup2
RIGHT SAYING THAT WILL BRING IT

01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:09.125 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

01:07:07.924 --> 01:07:09.893 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:12.295 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THIS IS A VERY

01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:14.397 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE BELL UNFORTUNATELY

01:07:12.295 --> 01:07:16.566 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:18.134 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE HILL PALADIN RAN A

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:19.802 region:rollup2
LOT OF THESE AYE I DO AGREE.

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:21.437 region:rollup2
TENDS TO BENEFIT THE PERPETRATOR

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:24.707 region:rollup2
AND ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:25.742 region:rollup2
PREDATE AND THEY BUT WE ALSO

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:27.343 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:28.411 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT RE VICTIMIZING THE

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:29.112 region:rollup2
VICTIM AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:31.714 region:rollup2
THE VICTIM DOES NOT WANT.

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:32.782 region:rollup2
TO BE.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:34.150 region:rollup2
MADE THEIR NAME TO MAY PUBLIC

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:35.451 region:rollup2
THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE MADE PUBLIC

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:36.920 region:rollup2
SAID THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:39.155 region:rollup2
THING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE EVEN

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:42.659 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:44.928 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE ALSO TOO LONG HELD.

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:46.596 region:rollup2
VERY BAD BEHAVIOR FROM

01:07:44.928 --> 01:07:48.464 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS AND STAFF IN

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:50.133 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE WHICH MEANS THAT THE

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:52.302 region:rollup2
PUBLIC IN OUR VOTERS DON'T HAVE

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:55.471 region:rollup2
THEY THE ABILITY TO KNOW ABOUT

01:07:52.302 --> 01:07:57.273 region:rollup2
THAT BAD BEHAVIOR ALLOWING. FOR

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:57.840 region:rollup2
CONTINUATION OF THAT AND THAT'S

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:59.342 region:rollup2
REALLY WHAT WE'RE HAVING TO

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.677 region:rollup2
STOP.

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.477 region:rollup2
SO I DO I DO UNDERSTAND THE

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:03.012 region:rollup2
CONCERNS OF SOME OF THE

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:04.280 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES HAVE WITH THIS BUT

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:06.182 region:rollup2
ISRAEL TO IN THE ABOUT US AND IF

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.184 region:rollup2

TO CONTINUED TO SHIELD ADVERT

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:10.186 region:rollup2
LEERING AT HER AND LAY

01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:11.187 region:rollup2
PERPETRATORS THAT ALLOW THEM TO

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:12.589 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO RE OFFEND I THINK

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:13.523 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT STATED

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.824 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO TAKE

01:08:13.523 --> 01:08:16.826 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY SERIOUSLY.

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:18.361 region:rollup2

INTERPRETER INTERPRETATION.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.470 region:rollup2
BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:35.505 region:rollup2
WHICH RENDERED THE ISSUE

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.806 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR.

EVEN AVOID LIABILITY FOR THE

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:52.822 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT AS WELL IF THEY

OPPOSITION'S CONCERN THAT THIS

ABOUT BRINGING A LAWSUIT.

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:51.027 region:rollup2
YEARS THIS WAS NOT AN ISSUE IN

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:52.395 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:53.562 region:rollup2
BUT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

01:13:52.395 --> 01:13:54.931 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TOOK A STEP BACKWARD

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:56.098 region:rollup2
WHEN THE SUPREME COURT ISSUED

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:12.315 region:rollup2
BUT THE DECISION AND TORREY

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:12.982 region:rollup2
PINES CHANGE THAT AND SINCE.

01:14:12.315 --> 01:14:15.051 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IS ONE OF THE

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:16.719 region:rollup2

HE WROTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:35.638 region:rollup2
COULD NOT HAVE INTENDED TO

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:37.206 region:rollup2
EXPOSE A SUPERVISOR TO

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:38.274 region:rollup2

THE CULTURE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:58.461 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO PREVENT THE REALITY

01:14:56.659 --> 01:15:00.029 region:rollup2
OF RETALIATION.

01:14:58.461 --> 01:15:01.664 region:rollup2

01:21:17.106 --> 01:21:20.175 region:rollup2
I WAS EMPLOYED BY THE UNIVERSITY

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:21.276 region:rollup2

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:22.378 region:rollup2

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:26.181 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TEN YEARS AGO.

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.950 region:rollup2
IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE I WAS

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:29.651 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT EFFECTIVE AT HOME I

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:31.653 region:rollup2
LIVED ON EGGSHELLS I FREAK

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:33.522 region:rollup2
FEARED FOR MY LIFE.

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:35.090 region:rollup2
AND THE SAFETY OF MY SON.

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:36.325 region:rollup2
I'D SLEEP ON THE GROUND FOR

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:38.160 region:rollup2
GUESTROOM SAGA CLIMB OUT A

01:21:36.325 --> 01:21:39.228 region:rollup2
WINDOW AT THE CAR BACK IN THE

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:41.096 region:rollup2
DRIVEWAY I HAD A NOTE IN MY

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:42.131 region:rollup2
SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX THAT SAID IF

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:44.466 region:rollup2
ANYTHING HAPPENED TO ME IT WAS

01:21:42.131 --> 01:21:45.901 region:rollup2
MY HUSBAND.

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:46.201 region:rollup2
ONLY AFTER MY SON'S BRAIN INJURY

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.704 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:50.572 region:rollup2
AS ME.

01:21:48.704 --> 01:21:53.909 region:rollup2
DID MY SON'S SAFETY OUT WAY MY

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:55.711 region:rollup2
OWN FEAR OF THE FINANCIAL LOSS.

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:56.678 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAWS PROTECT ME FROM

01:21:55.711 --> 01:21:56.979 region:rollup2
PAYING SPOUSAL SUPPORT

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:58.981 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:21:56.979 --> 01:22:03.185 region:rollup2
SORRY.

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:04.419 region:rollup2
I HAD IT TOGETHER.

01:22:03.185 --> 01:22:06.688 region:rollup2
THEY DO NOT PROTECT ME FROM

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:09.892 region:rollup2
LOSING UP 250% OF MY PENSION AND

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:11.960 region:rollup2
MY RETIREMENT SAVINGS.

01:22:09.892 --> 01:22:13.295 region:rollup2
I'M LIVING ON THOSE WITH MONIES.

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.963 region:rollup2
THOSE PENSION RETIREMENT DOLLARS

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:15.731 region:rollup2
IT IS NO DIFFERENT TO ME THAN

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:18.066 region:rollup2
PROVIDING HIM WITH SPOUSAL

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:20.302 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:22.671 region:rollup2
HE GAINES I LOSE UNLESS I STAY

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:23.872 region:rollup2
MARRIED TO HIM.

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:25.207 region:rollup2
IF I'D STAYED IN THIS

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:26.842 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP UNTIL YOU TRIED TO

01:22:25.207 --> 01:22:28.610 region:rollup2
MURDER ME.

01:22:26.842 --> 01:22:30.879 region:rollup2
I WOULDN'T LOSE ANY RETIREMENT

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.947 region:rollup2
PENSION INCOME UNDER STATE LAW.

01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:33.649 region:rollup2
THE LINE OF LUCK BETWEEN

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:35.984 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTED MURDER AND MURDER IS

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:38.086 region:rollup2
TOO THIN AND UNPREDICTABLE TO BE

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:38.754 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE INTENDED

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:40.088 region:rollup2
TO BE.

01:22:38.754 --> 01:22:42.257 region:rollup2
THE BEST TO PROTECT DOMESTIC

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:43.759 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE VICTIMS.

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:44.726 region:rollup2
MY HUSBAND PLAYED A MY FEAR OF

01:22:43.759 --> 01:22:46.495 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL INSECURITY TO KEEP ME

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:47.529 region:rollup2
CAPTIVE.

01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:48.263 region:rollup2
HIS RETURN ON INVESTMENT

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:52.134 region:rollup2
INCREASED WITH THE YEARS OF

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:52.134 region:rollup2
ABUSE.

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:55.871 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT ABOUT DENYING IN

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:56.605 region:rollup2
NICE GUY WHO SHARE OF COMMUNITY

01:22:55.871 --> 01:22:58.974 region:rollup2
PROPERTY EARNED DURING THE

01:22:56.605 --> 01:23:00.909 region:rollup2
MARRIAGE.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:03.545 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT FINANCE FUTURE

01:23:00.909 --> 01:23:05.547 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL REWARD. FOR SOMEBODY

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:07.149 region:rollup2
WHO EXTRACTED FROM THE VICTIM

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:09.418 region:rollup2
DURING THE GOING PERPETRATION OF

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:11.320 region:rollup2
THE CRIME.

01:23:09.418 --> 01:23:13.222 region:rollup2
IT REWARDS THIS VICTIM ANY

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.822 region:rollup2
VICTIM WILL PAY TO THE ABUSER

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:15.824 region:rollup2
FOR THE REST OF THE VICTIM'S

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:17.426 region:rollup2
LIFE.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:19.695 region:rollup2
IT SORT OF MOVES INTO THE LINE

01:23:17.426 --> 01:23:20.896 region:rollup2
OF ELDER ABUSE AT THAT POINT.

01:23:19.695 --> 01:23:22.564 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY MY HUSBAND WILL BE

01:23:20.896 --> 01:23:25.033 region:rollup2
REWARDED.

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:26.935 region:rollup2
MY SON AND I WILL STRUGGLE.

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:28.570 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WILL ALSO HELP REMOVE

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:30.405 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL INSECURITY THAT

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:32.040 region:rollup2
HOLDS MANY VICTIMS LIKE IT DID

01:23:30.405 --> 01:23:33.408 region:rollup2
ME CAPTIVE.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.310 region:rollup2
AND I WILL SEND THE MESSAGE TO

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:37.079 region:rollup2
ABUSERS AT THERE'S OF FINANCIAL

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:38.881 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCE FOR THEIR ABUSE.

01:23:37.079 --> 01:23:41.850 region:rollup2
IT WILL HELP VICTIMS LIKE ME

01:23:38.881 --> 01:23:43.752 region:rollup2
COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS.

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:46.021 region:rollup2
I'M STILL MARRIED TO MY HUSBAND.

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:47.155 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:49.191 region:rollup2
LEAVING AMBER SO DIRE GIVEN MY

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:50.959 region:rollup2

KNOW WHAT TO DO.

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.796 region:rollup2
I HAVE THE OPTION TO CIVIL

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:56.431 region:rollup2

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:58.166 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CHOSE TO

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:59.534 region:rollup2
LET HIM PLEAD BARGAIN DOWN.

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:00.702 region:rollup2
I'D HAVE TO START ALL OVER IN

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:02.538 region:rollup2
CIVIL COURT BECAUSE I CAN'T

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:03.872 region:rollup2
CARRY THAT CONVICTION FORWARD

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.940 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A DECISION OF THE STATE

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:06.542 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA I HAD NO SAY IN

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:07.709 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:09.311 region:rollup2
I URGE YOU TO VOTE POSITIVELY

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:11.113 region:rollup2

BE PROTECTED FROM AND I DEEMED.

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:59.094 region:rollup2
AN UNETHICAL LOOPHOLE IN

01:24:57.726 --> 01:25:00.596 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FAMILY LAW.

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.563 region:rollup2
HAVE NOTHING TO PERSONALLY GAIN

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:04.533 region:rollup2
BY URGING THIS LEGISLATIVE

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:05.934 region:rollup2
CHANGE I'M MINERALOGIST WHO

01:25:04.533 --> 01:25:08.170 region:rollup2
TRAINED AT ONE OF THOSE IVY

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:10.872 region:rollup2

I'M YOUNG I HAVE IN HAD A GOOD

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:13.875 region:rollup2
STEADY INCOME.

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:16.244 region:rollup2
I HAD A RESPECTABLE EDUCATION A

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:17.679 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE BASEASSOCIATED WITH

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:19.348 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING ABUSE AND

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:21.083 region:rollup2
PSYCHOPATHIC.

01:25:19.348 --> 01:25:23.118 region:rollup2
I WAS EVEN ON MY PSYCHIATRIC

01:25:21.083 --> 01:25:25.087 region:rollup2
ROTATION AT THE NUMBER ONE

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:26.622 region:rollup2
PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTION IN THE

01:25:25.087 --> 01:25:27.823 region:rollup2
COUNTRY WHEN I MARRIED.

01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:29.491 region:rollup2
HOWEVER NONE OF THIS EDUCATION

01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:30.993 region:rollup2
PROTECTED ME.

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:32.828 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND TO MY MARRIAGE WITH

01:25:30.993 --> 01:25:34.396 region:rollup2
NO WARNING SIGNS AND THE ABUSE

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:36.231 region:rollup2
WAS INTRODUCED IN A SLOW

01:25:34.396 --> 01:25:38.300 region:rollup2
CALCULATED WAY.

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:39.401 region:rollup2
THAT LED ME TO BE BOTH FEARFUL.

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.370 region:rollup2
FULL OF GUILT AND SERVITUDE ALL

01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:42.871 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME.

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:45.140 region:rollup2
I'VE SINCE LEARNED THIS IS ALL

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:47.009 region:rollup2
PART OF THE VICTIMIZATION CYCLE.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:49.044 region:rollup2
IN THE END HE NEARLY ENDED MY

01:25:47.009 --> 01:25:51.113 region:rollup2
LIFE LAYING IN WAIT WITH A SHOT

01:25:49.044 --> 01:25:53.281 region:rollup2

01:25:51.113 --> 01:25:54.483 region:rollup2
STRANGLING INCIDENT.

01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:56.218 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT CALIFORNIA WAS A

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:58.153 region:rollup2
PROGRESSIVE STATE UNTIL I WENT

01:25:56.218 --> 01:25:59.154 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE.

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:01.056 region:rollup2
I DO NOT BELIEVE THE LOS

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:03.191 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO FINANCIALLY BENEFIT

01:26:01.056 --> 01:26:04.826 region:rollup2
ABUSERS BUT I DO THINK THEY WERE

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:05.994 region:rollup2
WRITTEN AT A TIME WHEN IT WAS

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:07.129 region:rollup2
ASSUMED ONLY WOMEN COULD BE

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:07.929 region:rollup2
ABUSED.

01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:09.364 region:rollup2
AND ONLY MEN COULD EARN AN

01:26:07.929 --> 01:26:11.533 region:rollup2
INCOME.

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:13.168 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE REALITY IS ANYONE IS

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:15.971 region:rollup2

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:17.406 region:rollup2
MEANS STATUS OR GENDER.

ABUSIVE SPOUSE.

01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:07.082 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS FOR

01:33:04.813 --> 01:33:09.818 region:rollup2
VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE --

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:10.418 region:rollup2
THE ADDITIONAL RELIEF AB ELEVEN

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:12.020 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINE SIX TO CREATE MAY

01:33:10.418 --> 01:33:13.855 region:rollup2
HAVE SIGNIFICANT UNINTENDED

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.456 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT

01:33:13.855 --> 01:33:16.391 region:rollup2
COULD ULTIMATELY UNDERMINE ITS

01:33:14.456 --> 01:33:18.259 region:rollup2
INTENT.

01:33:16.391 --> 01:33:19.761 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUES

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:20.862 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED BY OTHER GROUPS LIKE

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:26.334 region:rollup2
SCUM WOULD LIKE TO RAISE THE

01:33:20.862 --> 01:33:27.902 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING AREAS OF CONCERN.

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.403 region:rollup2
THE PENSION PROVISION WILL

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:30.605 region:rollup2
STATED BY THE BILL IS

01:33:28.403 --> 01:33:32.240 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC AS DRAFTED IT CANNOT

01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:33.374 region:rollup2
BE TAILORED TO ENSURE JUSTICE ON

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.642 region:rollup2
THE FACTS OF A PARTICULAR CASE

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:36.144 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT FALL INTO THE

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:37.178 region:rollup2
TYPICAL --

01:33:36.144 --> 01:33:38.713 region:rollup2
PATTERN THAT WE THAT WE USUALLY

01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:40.548 region:rollup2
SEE.

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:42.117 region:rollup2
WHILE THE TYPICAL DB SCENARIO IS

01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:44.552 region:rollup2
THE EXERCISE OF COURSE OF

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:45.053 region:rollup2
CONTROL BY THE DOMINANT PARTNER

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:46.087 region:rollup2
IS NOT THE ONLY POSSIBLE

01:33:45.053 --> 01:33:47.489 region:rollup2
SCENARIO.

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:48.823 region:rollup2
THEY'RE RELATIVELY RARE BUT

01:33:47.489 --> 01:33:50.592 region:rollup2
COMPELLING INSTANCES IN WHICH

01:33:48.823 --> 01:33:52.694 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT PART OF

01:33:50.592 --> 01:33:53.228 region:rollup2
A PATTERN OF COURSE OF CONTROL

01:33:52.694 --> 01:33:54.395 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S RATHER A ONE TIME

01:33:53.228 --> 01:33:55.163 region:rollup2
OCCURRENCE.

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:57.365 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A SITUATIONAL

01:33:55.163 --> 01:33:59.000 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND IT'S

01:33:57.365 --> 01:34:03.505 region:rollup2
EXISTENCE IS SUPPORTED BY SOLID

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:05.807 region:rollup2
SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH.

01:34:03.505 --> 01:34:06.674 region:rollup2
ANYINSTANCE OF A VICTIM FINALLY

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:08.042 region:rollup2
RETALIATING AFTER YEARS OF IT OF

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:09.777 region:rollup2
ABUSE.

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:11.446 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE JUST FOR THE COURT

01:34:09.777 --> 01:34:12.213 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE JUDICIAL

01:34:11.446 --> 01:34:12.780 region:rollup2
DISCRETION REGARDING

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:14.716 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PENSION

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:15.884 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

01:34:14.716 --> 01:34:17.185 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THE PARTIES COMMIT

01:34:15.884 --> 01:34:19.420 region:rollup2
ACTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:34:17.185 --> 01:34:20.488 region:rollup2
AGAINST EACH OTHER --

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.357 region:rollup2
I THINK ONE OF THE PHRASES USED

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:22.924 region:rollup2
ITS MITCHELL COMBATANTS.

01:34:22.357 --> 01:34:24.559 region:rollup2
AND BOTH WERE FOUND TO BE AT

01:34:22.924 --> 01:34:26.094 region:rollup2
FAULT.

01:34:24.559 --> 01:34:27.428 region:rollup2
THE BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR

01:34:26.094 --> 01:34:28.963 region:rollup2
WHAT OCCURS IN THIS INSTANCE.

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:30.698 region:rollup2
BUT UNDER THE CURRENT LANGUAGE

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:32.200 region:rollup2
OF THE BILL THE EFFECT WOULD BE.

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:33.134 region:rollup2
THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:34.736 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY FINANCIALLY

01:34:33.134 --> 01:34:38.540 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED IT'S GOING TO

01:34:34.736 --> 01:34:39.841 region:rollup2
REMAIN THAT WAY --

01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:40.475 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT IT WOULD BE

01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:42.310 region:rollup2
EXACERBATED RELATIVE TO CURRENT

01:34:40.475 --> 01:34:44.946 region:rollup2
LAW.

I'VE HANDLED AS A PROSECUTOR AND

01:35:41.336 --> 01:35:43.605 region:rollup2

AN ABUSE IN MP USER IS CHARGED.

01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:38.072 region:rollup2
LIKELY A PROSECUTOR IS GOING TO

WORK WITH THE VICTIM.

01:39:38.072 --> 01:39:41.943 region:rollup2
YOUR TESTIMONY FROM THAT VICTIM

01:39:40.908 --> 01:39:42.677 region:rollup2

THAT.

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:47.515 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULDN'T PURSUE THIS

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:50.218 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY CAN PURSUE A REMEDY

01:39:47.515 --> 01:39:51.018 region:rollup2
IN TORT BY PURSUING A CIVIL

01:39:50.218 --> 01:39:53.187 region:rollup2

01:39:51.018 --> 01:39:55.189 region:rollup2
AFTER THE ABUSE HAS TAKEN PLACE

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:56.524 region:rollup2
ARM AND THAT REQUIRES THEM TO

01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:59.060 region:rollup2
COME BACK INTO COURT TO

01:40:00.962 --> 01:40:04.098 region:rollup2
THE ONLY PLACE THAT IT CAN

01:40:02.163 --> 01:40:06.000 region:rollup2

HYPOTHETICAL WE'VE HEARD IS THAT

RETALIATION A VICTIM OF ABUSE --

01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:29.290 region:rollup2
LIKE MISS MARTIN FOR MANY YEARS.

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:32.293 region:rollup2
REACHES A BREAKING POINT THROWS

01:40:29.290 --> 01:40:33.728 region:rollup2
A VASE AT THE LONG TERM ABUSER

01:40:33.728 --> 01:40:37.064 region:rollup2
WELL SIMPLY THROWING A BASIS

01:40:35.363 --> 01:40:39.200 region:rollup2
PRAY NOT GONNA BE CHARGED AS A

IF IT WERE IT MIGHT BE PLAYED

01:40:40.902 --> 01:40:45.139 region:rollup2
DOWN TO A MISDEMEANOR THE JUDGE

01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:46.807 region:rollup2
RESERVES IN THIS BILL FULL

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:47.341 region:rollup2
DISCRETION TO REVIEW THAT

01:40:46.807 --> 01:40:50.144 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF TWENTY YEARS OF

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:53.814 region:rollup2
ABUSE.

01:40:50.144 --> 01:40:55.783 region:rollup2
TO REVIEW FACTS IN EVIDENCE OF A

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:57.885 region:rollup2
BREAKING POINT OF A VICTIM.

01:40:55.783 --> 01:40:59.654 region:rollup2
AND THE FULL DISCRETION TOWARD

01:40:57.885 --> 01:41:01.055 region:rollup2
SOME OR NONE.

01:40:59.654 --> 01:41:05.026 region:rollup2
OF THE PENSIONER COMMUNITY

PROPERTY A TO THE ABUSER OR NINE

01:41:05.026 --> 01:41:07.161 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THE AMENDMENTS

01:41:06.694 --> 01:41:09.030 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:10.398 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED.

01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:12.233 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE MISDEMEANOR

01:41:10.398 --> 01:41:14.635 region:rollup2
IT PROTECTS FULL DISCRETION OF

01:41:12.233 --> 01:41:16.203 region:rollup2
THE JUDGE TO TO LISTEN TO THESE.

01:41:14.635 --> 01:41:16.737 region:rollup2
WHAT I THINK UPRIGHT UNIQUE

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:19.073 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES I RECOGNIZE THEY

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:21.642 region:rollup2
HAPPEN?

01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:24.278 region:rollup2
BUT FRIENDS THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:26.881 region:rollup2
VICTIMS OF ABUSE ARE WOMEN.

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:28.215 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY OF VICTIMS OF

01:41:26.881 --> 01:41:29.417 region:rollup2
THAT ABUSE ARE FROM ABUSIVE

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:31.118 region:rollup2
HUSBANDS.

01:41:29.417 --> 01:41:33.955 region:rollup2
IN THE CURRENT LAW.

01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:35.923 region:rollup2
TEX THEM IN SHARING A THE

01:41:33.955 --> 01:41:39.026 region:rollup2

VICTIM WERE TRYING TO CONFORM.

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:43.464 region:rollup2
TO LAW WHAT ALREADY EXISTS FOR

01:41:41.262 --> 01:41:45.366 region:rollup2
THE VICTIM OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT

01:41:43.464 --> 01:41:47.835 region:rollup2
OR AN ATTEMPTED MURDER WE THINK

01:41:45.366 --> 01:41:48.469 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD APPLY TO ALL VICTIMS

01:41:47.835 --> 01:41:50.004 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S A FELONY

01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:51.305 region:rollup2
CONVICTION SO I HOPE THAT

01:41:50.004 --> 01:41:53.474 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES IT MAYBE NOT

01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:53.774 region:rollup2
SATISFACTORILY BUT THAT WOULD BE

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:56.210 region:rollup2
MY RESPONSE.

THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL

01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:07.488 region:rollup2
FORD I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.424 region:rollup2
BUILD OF MAN ISSUE THAT WE

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:11.792 region:rollup2
CONTINUALLY AND UNDERSTANDABLY.

01:42:10.424 --> 01:42:13.327 region:rollup2
ARE OF PUTTING MORE MORE FOCUS

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:16.263 region:rollup2
ON THE MORE VERY REALIZING ABOUT

01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:18.666 region:rollup2
ABUSE AND THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY

01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:20.901 region:rollup2

01:42:21.569 --> 01:42:26.107 region:rollup2
A SORT OF PERPETRATORS AND THAT

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:27.141 region:rollup2
THE THAT THERE IS BUDGET AND

01:42:26.107 --> 01:42:28.743 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THAT I THINK WE'RE

01:42:27.141 --> 01:42:30.745 region:rollup2
LEARNING A LOT MORE ABOUT THAT

01:42:28.743 --> 01:42:33.080 region:rollup2
IN RECENT YEARS WHICH IS GOOD --

01:42:30.745 --> 01:42:34.982 region:rollup2
AND AND CERTAINLY I THINK --

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:35.983 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:37.118 region:rollup2
ARE MANY SITUATIONS AND

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:38.686 region:rollup2
SCENARIOS WHERE VICTIMS TO BE

01:42:37.118 --> 01:42:40.988 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL HOSTAGES IN DIFFERENT

01:42:38.686 --> 01:42:43.424 region:rollup2
FORMS IN THIS FORMAT COULD BE.

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:44.258 region:rollup2
DUBBED RISK OF LOSING THEIR

01:42:43.424 --> 01:42:45.326 region:rollup2

01:42:47.628 --> 01:42:49.263 region:rollup2
FOR MANY IMMIGRANTS I KNOW THAT

01:42:48.262 --> 01:42:50.798 region:rollup2
WE SEE THIS LOT SOUTH ASIAN

01:42:49.263 --> 01:42:52.033 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY OF THEY COME HERE --

01:42:50.798 --> 01:42:53.000 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE MARRIED INCOME HERE

01:42:52.033 --> 01:42:54.668 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYONE THEY

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.302 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE AND AND AND A PILL

01:42:54.668 --> 01:42:56.837 region:rollup2
HELPLESS TO BE ABLE TO REACH OUT

01:42:55.302 --> 01:42:58.406 region:rollup2
--

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:59.940 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC

01:42:58.406 --> 01:43:02.243 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE BECAUSE THEY WILL BE

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.977 region:rollup2
ABANDONED UP AND SOUTHERN ALLOT

01:43:02.243 --> 01:43:04.712 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT.

01:43:02.977 --> 01:43:08.049 region:rollup2
WEB FORMS THAT THIS KIND OF

01:43:04.712 --> 01:43:09.750 region:rollup2
ABUSE TAKES SHAPE IN AND AND SO

01:43:08.049 --> 01:43:11.318 region:rollup2
I I APPRECIATE OF MISS MARTIN

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:12.386 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS THAT WERE BILLION TO

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:13.821 region:rollup2
HAVE THE COURAGE TO SPEAK ABOUT

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:16.023 region:rollup2
IS VERY VULNERABLE.

01:43:13.821 --> 01:43:18.859 region:rollup2
A POSITION IBM IS COURAGEOUS AND

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:21.062 region:rollup2
IT REMINDS ME OF OF WHEN I WAS

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:23.264 region:rollup2
AT A YOUNG ATTORNEY WAS IN

01:43:21.062 --> 01:43:25.533 region:rollup2
CHAMBERS AND WAS OF A CASE ROUTE

01:43:23.264 --> 01:43:29.603 region:rollup2
BUT LITTLE MOTIONAL BOWDEN.

01:43:25.533 --> 01:43:31.272 region:rollup2
SORT OF CRIME. TO BEING HUMAN

01:43:29.603 --> 01:43:32.807 region:rollup2
AND SO BOB PLEASE DON'T

01:43:31.272 --> 01:43:33.674 region:rollup2
APOLOGIZE FOR THE MOTION USUALLY

01:43:32.807 --> 01:43:35.209 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT COMES

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:37.044 region:rollup2
FROM A REAL PLACE AND IT HELPS

01:43:35.209 --> 01:43:38.479 region:rollup2
US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS.

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:39.647 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DOING LIES IN YOUR

01:43:38.479 --> 01:43:41.248 region:rollup2
DOING YOU KNOW COME UP ON PAPER

01:43:39.647 --> 01:43:42.917 region:rollup2
BLACK WHITE THAT WERE ACTUALLY

01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:43.851 region:rollup2
TRYING OUR BEST TO PROTECT

01:43:42.917 --> 01:43:45.319 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY.

01:43:43.851 --> 01:43:47.388 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DO

01:43:45.319 --> 01:43:49.590 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS WE ARE HEARING OTHER

01:43:47.388 --> 01:43:51.358 region:rollup2
IS DUE PROCESS OUR RIGHTS THAT

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:53.461 region:rollup2
EVERYONE HAS UP THROUGH OUR

01:43:53.461 --> 01:43:56.664 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE NAM.

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:58.933 region:rollup2
EYES WORK AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER

01:43:56.664 --> 01:44:00.167 region:rollup2
W. DEFENDER FOR ELEVEN YEARS --

01:43:58.933 --> 01:44:01.569 region:rollup2
AND SO KNOW VERY WELL --

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:03.037 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:05.673 region:rollup2
SYSTEM FAR MORE THAN THE FAMILY

01:44:03.037 --> 01:44:07.641 region:rollup2
COURT SYSTEM HOWEVER --

01:44:05.673 --> 01:44:09.610 region:rollup2
BY UNDERSTANDING OF OTHER FAMILY

01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:11.912 region:rollup2
LIVES AND IT GETS VERY

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:14.815 region:rollup2
CONTENTIOUS AND I APPRECIATE.

01:44:11.912 --> 01:44:17.118 region:rollup2
THE THE HONING AND AND THE FOCUS

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:19.353 region:rollup2
OF THE AMENDMENTS ON THE THAT

01:44:17.118 --> 01:44:20.688 region:rollup2
THE MISDEMEANOR ASPECT BECAUSE

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:22.323 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES MY UNDERSTANDING OF

01:44:20.688 --> 01:44:23.724 region:rollup2
FAMILY COURT NO ACCUSATIONS ARE

01:44:22.323 --> 01:44:25.993 region:rollup2
FLYING BACK AND FORTH I THINK.

01:44:23.724 --> 01:44:27.027 region:rollup2
WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:29.230 region:rollup2
A COURT --

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:31.599 region:rollup2
HAS THE DISCRETION --

01:44:29.230 --> 01:44:33.267 region:rollup2
TO IT YOU AS TO HOW IT APPLIES

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:34.034 region:rollup2
THE RULE WAS THAT AND IS IT UP

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:35.636 region:rollup2
THERE WITH THE REBUTTABLE

01:44:34.034 --> 01:44:39.306 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTION AS APPLIES. TO

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:40.674 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR CHARGES I AND I DO.

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:42.409 region:rollup2
AS OFTENTIMES CASE HAS SOME

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:44.011 region:rollup2
SENSITIVITY TO THAT THOUGH REYES

01:44:42.409 --> 01:44:45.179 region:rollup2

REFRAIN.

01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:01.128 region:rollup2
I TAKE IT TO HEART BECAUSE

01:44:59.894 --> 01:45:03.230 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO DOUBT WERE STILL MY

MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO AND I

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:11.238 region:rollup2

FOR MORE MORE MORE OCCASIONS

01:45:14.341 --> 01:45:16.043 region:rollup2
WHERE --

01:45:14.875 --> 01:45:18.045 region:rollup2
COURT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE

01:45:16.043 --> 01:45:19.280 region:rollup2
MORE DISCRETION THAN CLEARLY

01:45:18.045 --> 01:45:20.648 region:rollup2
THAT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY ASK

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:23.184 region:rollup2
A I'D TO WORKLOAD.

01:45:20.648 --> 01:45:24.518 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I I APPRECIATE JUST WHAT

01:45:23.184 --> 01:45:26.453 region:rollup2
DISCRETION I KNOW THAT I'VE SAID

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:28.189 region:rollup2
THIS ON IN THE PAST MY COMES TO

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:29.623 region:rollup2
MANDATORY ENHANCEMENTS WHAT HAVE

01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:30.824 region:rollup2

AND I'M.

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:33.894 region:rollup2
THAT THOUGH THE ONE THING I'LL

01:45:32.459 --> 01:45:36.564 region:rollup2
MENTION IS THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT

01:45:33.894 --> 01:45:38.132 region:rollup2
WITH THE FELONY CHARGES.

01:45:36.564 --> 01:45:39.200 region:rollup2
BUT YES I COULD ADD ANOTHER

01:45:38.132 --> 01:45:42.169 region:rollup2
ELEMENT --

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.437 region:rollup2
I'M TO OF DEFENDANTS TO CONSIDER

01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:44.572 region:rollup2
TO WAY.

01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:46.073 region:rollup2
AS TO WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA

01:45:44.572 --> 01:45:47.508 region:rollup2
PLEAD GUILTY OR NOT THAT THERE'S

01:45:46.073 --> 01:45:48.175 region:rollup2
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT ANYTIME YOU

01:45:47.508 --> 01:45:50.211 region:rollup2
OUR THERE'S IMMIGRATION

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:51.212 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCE POTENTIAL TAMMY LA

01:45:50.211 --> 01:45:52.746 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCE BUT THERE'S HAS TO

01:45:51.212 --> 01:45:54.415 region:rollup2
TRUST YOUR CHILDREN.

01:45:52.746 --> 01:45:56.517 region:rollup2
EYES UP OF FORMER DEFENSE ARE

01:45:54.415 --> 01:45:57.851 region:rollup2
THOSE ALL THINGS THAT WE WOULD.

01:45:56.517 --> 01:45:59.520 region:rollup2
VERY SERIOUSLY ADVISE OUR

01:45:57.851 --> 01:46:01.322 region:rollup2
CLIENTS ON AND THIS WOULD BE ONE

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.622 region:rollup2
MORE THING ON A FELONY CASE

01:46:01.322 --> 01:46:04.491 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:46:01.622 --> 01:46:06.527 region:rollup2
BUT AB TO SUGGEST THAT.

01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:07.628 region:rollup2
THIS CONSEQUENCE ALONE WILL BE A

01:46:06.527 --> 01:46:08.863 region:rollup2
DETERMINING FACTOR AS WHETHER

01:46:07.628 --> 01:46:10.698 region:rollup2
THE GO TO TRIAL OR NOT.

01:46:08.863 --> 01:46:11.699 region:rollup2
IS JUST NOT REALISTIC I'M I

01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:13.234 region:rollup2
THINK THAT.

01:46:11.699 --> 01:46:15.469 region:rollup2
IF SOMEONE'S FACING PRISON TIME

01:46:13.234 --> 01:46:16.337 region:rollup2
IF THEY DON'T A TRIAL AND IF

01:46:15.469 --> 01:46:18.105 region:rollup2
THEY ARE.

01:46:16.337 --> 01:46:19.006 region:rollup2
GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID

01:46:18.105 --> 01:46:20.741 region:rollup2
PRISON TIME FOR NOT GOING TO

01:46:19.006 --> 01:46:23.410 region:rollup2
TRIAL I THINK THAT PROBABLY HAS

01:46:20.741 --> 01:46:24.478 region:rollup2
A MUCH GREATER IMPACT ON THEIR

01:46:23.410 --> 01:46:26.513 region:rollup2
DECISION AS TO WHETHER THEY

01:46:24.478 --> 01:46:27.314 region:rollup2
PETER NOT AND AS OPPOSED TO

01:46:26.513 --> 01:46:28.449 region:rollup2
FIGHTING IT ALL THE WAY.

01:46:27.314 --> 01:46:30.851 region:rollup2
NOT SAYING THAT THERE WILL BE

01:46:28.449 --> 01:46:32.353 region:rollup2
OCCASIONS WHERE GOING TO GO

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:33.854 region:rollup2
FORWARD BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE OF

01:46:32.353 --> 01:46:36.657 region:rollup2
COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME

01:46:33.854 --> 01:46:37.992 region:rollup2
OCCASIONS BUT IN THE BALANCE.

01:46:36.657 --> 01:46:40.261 region:rollup2
HOW AM I DON'T?

01:46:37.992 --> 01:46:41.762 region:rollup2
I'M I I DON'T SEE THAT IF YOU'RE

01:46:40.261 --> 01:46:44.832 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT A LEGITIMATE

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:47.534 region:rollup2
SERIOUS FELONY CASE I AM A THAT

01:46:44.832 --> 01:46:48.636 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE REDUCED

01:46:47.534 --> 01:46:49.570 region:rollup2
TO A MISDEMEANOR OFTENTIMES

01:46:48.636 --> 01:46:50.170 region:rollup2
BENEATH ON THE CASES ARE REDUCED

01:46:49.570 --> 01:46:51.639 region:rollup2
TO MISDEMEANOR WHEN THE FACTS

COME OUT AND AND AND UP TO

01:46:51.639 --> 01:46:53.307 region:rollup2
CLEVELAND.

01:46:52.172 --> 01:46:55.109 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE'S A WOMAN BEING

01:46:53.307 --> 01:46:56.744 region:rollup2
ACCUSED OF FELONY AND THEYARE A

01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:58.245 region:rollup2
PART OF THE A A AND THEY'VE BEEN

01:46:56.744 --> 01:46:59.546 region:rollup2

CRIMINAL COURT LEVEL.

01:47:04.385 --> 01:47:07.988 region:rollup2
THOSE ISSUES WILL BE TAKEN INTO

01:47:05.653 --> 01:47:10.324 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT AND DOLBY CONSIDERATION

01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:11.525 region:rollup2
AND OFTENTIMES THOSE CASES WILL

01:47:10.324 --> 01:47:11.759 region:rollup2
BE REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR

01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:13.794 region:rollup2
GIVEN.

01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:16.463 region:rollup2
THE THAT THE THE NATURE OF THE

01:47:13.794 --> 01:47:17.097 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP AND OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:47:16.463 --> 01:47:20.301 region:rollup2

HAPPEN TO FURTHER DELVE INTO THE

01:47:20.935 --> 01:47:24.471 region:rollup2
CASE.

01:47:22.002 --> 01:47:25.773 region:rollup2
I'M I DON'T KNOW THE ONE THING

01:47:24.471 --> 01:47:26.840 region:rollup2
JUST YOU KNOW A AS A DEFENSE

01:47:25.773 --> 01:47:30.210 region:rollup2

IS THE I KNOW THIS ISN'T IN SOME

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:34.648 region:rollup2
WAYS NOT DIRECTLY COLONEL HANSON

01:47:32.313 --> 01:47:37.384 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES ENHANCE PENALTIES

01:47:34.648 --> 01:47:39.219 region:rollup2
FOR CRIMINAL OFFENSES AND SO --

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:40.688 region:rollup2

STILL A FAR MORE TO SUPPORT

01:47:47.194 --> 01:47:50.097 region:rollup2
SHOULD NUMBER WOMEN --

01:47:48.495 --> 01:47:51.932 region:rollup2

YEARS DOWN THE LINE.

01:48:15.889 --> 01:48:19.560 region:rollup2
WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE BECAUSE I

01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:21.362 region:rollup2
DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT HAVE

01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:22.029 region:rollup2
BEEN RAISED INCLUDING WAYS BY

01:48:21.362 --> 01:48:24.331 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION?

01:48:22.029 --> 01:48:26.233 region:rollup2

THIS KILEY.

01:48:43.617 --> 01:48:47.154 region:rollup2

YOU OUT WARNER HAVE HAVE YOU

01:48:50.424 --> 01:48:54.895 region:rollup2
SEEN THAT PLAY OUT WITH RESPECT

01:48:52.493 --> 01:48:56.497 region:rollup2
TO THE FELONIES --

01:48:54.895 --> 01:48:59.033 region:rollup2
FOR WHICH THERE IS ALREADY A BAR

01:48:56.497 --> 01:49:00.167 region:rollup2
ON AYE SPOUSAL ABUSE --

01:48:59.033 --> 01:49:01.668 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND IF NOT WHY WOULD

01:49:00.167 --> 01:49:03.337 region:rollup2
THIS ADDITIONAL COSTS OF THEM

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:04.738 region:rollup2
FELONIES HAVE THOSE PERVERSE

01:49:03.337 --> 01:49:05.939 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES.

01:49:04.738 --> 01:49:07.374 region:rollup2
AND SAID SORRY AT SECOND

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:08.876 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS --

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:11.178 region:rollup2
UNDER --

01:49:08.876 --> 01:49:12.446 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAWS YOU KNOW THE THE

01:49:11.178 --> 01:49:14.481 region:rollup2
FAMILY LAW JUDGE CAN ALREADY

01:49:12.446 --> 01:49:16.650 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING CRIMINAL HISTORY AND

01:49:14.481 --> 01:49:17.818 region:rollup2
MAKING THE SPOUSAL ABUSE AWARD

01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:20.254 region:rollup2
AND SO --

01:49:17.818 --> 01:49:21.522 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A ROOM IM

01:49:20.254 --> 01:49:23.824 region:rollup2
XIN -- FOR

01:49:21.522 --> 01:49:25.592 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR CASES SO OUT WHY DO

01:49:23.824 --> 01:49:28.595 region:rollup2
YOU SEE --

01:49:25.592 --> 01:49:29.997 region:rollup2
THE ELEVATION OF THIS EVIDENCE

01:49:28.595 --> 01:49:32.199 region:rollup2
BEING RELEVANT TO IT BECOMING A

01:49:29.997 --> 01:49:34.401 region:rollup2
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION --

01:49:32.199 --> 01:49:37.504 region:rollup2
TO BE SUCH A STRONG --

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:38.672 region:rollup2
FACTOR THAT WOULD THEN DRIVE --

01:49:37.504 --> 01:49:39.239 region:rollup2
THE DECISION WHETHER TO ACCEPT A

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:40.974 region:rollup2
PLEA BARGAIN ON THE PART OF

01:49:39.239 --> 01:49:44.645 region:rollup2
DEFENDANT [inaudible]

01:49:40.974 --> 01:49:46.580 region:rollup2
I I THINK THE SECOND QUESTION IF

01:49:44.645 --> 01:49:49.116 region:rollup2
IF THAT'S OKAY --

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:50.951 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING A LOT

01:49:49.116 --> 01:49:52.953 region:rollup2
WHAT EXISTING LAW DOES IS GIVE

01:49:50.951 --> 01:49:54.521 region:rollup2
THE JUDICIAL OFFICER THE

01:49:52.953 --> 01:49:55.989 region:rollup2
DISCRETION TO TAKE.

01:49:54.521 --> 01:49:57.324 region:rollup2
ANY DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF

01:49:55.989 --> 01:49:59.092 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BETWEEN THE

01:49:57.324 --> 01:50:00.527 region:rollup2
PARTIES INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN

01:49:59.092 --> 01:50:01.361 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO THE AWARD OF SPOUSAL

01:50:00.527 --> 01:50:03.030 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

01:50:01.361 --> 01:50:04.531 region:rollup2
AND ATTORNEY'S FEES BECAUSE THE

01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:06.533 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS FEES STATUTES.

01:50:04.531 --> 01:50:07.768 region:rollup2
BUT DIRECT THE COURT TO LOOK AT

01:50:06.533 --> 01:50:09.636 region:rollup2
THE SPELLS SPORTS STATUES WHAT

01:50:07.768 --> 01:50:11.438 region:rollup2
IT COMES ABOUT BUT CREATING A

01:50:09.636 --> 01:50:12.573 region:rollup2
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR UP

01:50:11.438 --> 01:50:13.373 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE FOR A MISDEMEANOR

01:50:12.573 --> 01:50:14.708 region:rollup2
CONVICTION.

01:50:13.373 --> 01:50:16.210 region:rollup2
OVERCOMING OF A BY THE BOOK

01:50:14.708 --> 01:50:17.377 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTION IS VERY VERY

01:50:16.210 --> 01:50:18.345 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT --

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:20.380 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:21.949 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL YOU KNOW WOMAN WHO'S A

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:22.783 region:rollup2
STATE HOME MOM WHO DOESN'T HAVE

01:50:21.949 --> 01:50:24.818 region:rollup2
HER OWN.

01:50:22.783 --> 01:50:26.987 region:rollup2
PORT OR OR MONEY TO HIRE AN

01:50:24.818 --> 01:50:27.821 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY TO OVERCOME THAT VERY

01:50:26.987 --> 01:50:30.524 region:rollup2
BIG BURDEN.

01:50:27.821 --> 01:50:31.625 region:rollup2
OF BOTH OF THAT PRESUMPTION.

01:50:30.524 --> 01:50:33.227 region:rollup2
AND SHE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO

01:50:31.625 --> 01:50:34.661 region:rollup2
MOST LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO DO

01:50:33.227 --> 01:50:37.164 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK AS ATTORNEY AS A

01:50:34.661 --> 01:50:37.731 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONER VERY VERY DIFFICULT

01:50:37.164 --> 01:50:38.932 region:rollup2
TO OVERCOME OVER ABOUT ABOUT

01:50:37.731 --> 01:50:40.300 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTION.

01:50:38.932 --> 01:50:41.802 region:rollup2
VERSES THE CURRENT LAW WHICH

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:43.337 region:rollup2
ALLOWS THE COURT TO JUST TAKE

01:50:41.802 --> 01:50:45.272 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING INTO CONSIDERATION AN

01:50:43.337 --> 01:50:49.543 region:rollup2
EXERCISE OF DISCRETION WHICH WE

01:50:45.272 --> 01:50:51.011 region:rollup2
THINK IS THE BETTER PART WHICH

01:50:49.543 --> 01:50:52.479 region:rollup2
AND THEN THAT THE FIRST QUESTION

01:50:51.011 --> 01:50:53.447 region:rollup2
AND I AT WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:50:52.479 --> 01:50:54.481 region:rollup2
FELONIES THAT ARE ALREADY

01:50:53.447 --> 01:50:57.050 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED TO BE ACTIVE TO

01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:58.452 region:rollup2
CREATE THIS.

01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:59.086 region:rollup2
SPARK --

01:50:58.452 --> 01:51:00.053 region:rollup2
WELL I HOPE THAT I CAN ANSWER

01:50:59.086 --> 01:51:01.388 region:rollup2
YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY I DON'T

01:51:00.053 --> 01:51:02.756 region:rollup2
PRACTICE CRIMINAL LAW I PRACTICE

01:51:01.388 --> 01:51:04.992 region:rollup2
ONLY.

01:51:02.756 --> 01:51:06.093 region:rollup2
FAMILY LAW I CAN TALK TO ABOUT

01:51:04.992 --> 01:51:10.497 region:rollup2
THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES

01:51:06.093 --> 01:51:11.932 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANDATORY --

01:51:10.497 --> 01:51:14.535 region:rollup2
THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS AS A

01:51:11.932 --> 01:51:16.270 region:rollup2
RESULT OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:51:14.535 --> 01:51:18.071 region:rollup2
ACTION AND HOW WOULD IMPACT MY

01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:20.007 region:rollup2
CLIENTS.

01:51:18.071 --> 01:51:21.041 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SCARED TO DEATH TO GO

01:51:20.007 --> 01:51:22.876 region:rollup2
TO COURT.

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:24.144 region:rollup2
IT IS A STRUGGLE IT IS IT IS A

01:51:22.876 --> 01:51:25.746 region:rollup2
CONTINUING STRUGGLE THAT

01:51:24.144 --> 01:51:26.947 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THE SUPPORT OF EVERYONE

01:51:25.746 --> 01:51:30.150 region:rollup2
AROUND THEM WHEN THEY HAVE

01:51:26.947 --> 01:51:31.084 region:rollup2
GENUINELY BEEN VICTIMIZED. TWO

01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:32.452 region:rollup2
TO GET THEM TO HANG AND THROUGH

01:51:31.084 --> 01:51:34.121 region:rollup2
THE LITIGATION PROCESS TO GET

01:51:32.452 --> 01:51:37.858 region:rollup2
THE PROTECTION THAT THEY NEED.

01:51:34.121 --> 01:51:39.226 region:rollup2
AND I ALSO THINK THAT THIS --

01:51:37.858 --> 01:51:41.395 region:rollup2
IT IS BUT I REALIZED THAT IT'S A

01:51:39.226 --> 01:51:41.962 region:rollup2
VERY HARD CALL BUT I ALSO THINK

01:51:41.395 --> 01:51:43.230 region:rollup2
THAT THIS INCREASES RISK FOR

01:51:41.962 --> 01:51:44.731 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:51:43.230 --> 01:51:46.433 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE UPPING THE ANTE

01:51:44.731 --> 01:51:47.935 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT.

01:51:46.433 --> 01:51:49.436 region:rollup2
TO THE ABUSER WERE GIVING HIM

01:51:47.935 --> 01:51:49.736 region:rollup2
MORE TO BE ANGRY ABOUT

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:54.274 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:51:49.736 --> 01:51:56.076 region:rollup2
AND AND WHICH IS NOT TO SAY.

01:51:54.274 --> 01:51:59.112 region:rollup2
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT.

01:51:56.076 --> 01:52:01.048 region:rollup2
IN MANY CASES.

01:51:59.112 --> 01:52:02.216 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT WELL DESERVED AYE I

01:52:01.048 --> 01:52:03.383 region:rollup2
THINK FLEX COMES PROBLEMS WERE

01:52:02.216 --> 01:52:05.619 region:rollup2
REALLY CENTERED AROUND THE

01:52:03.383 --> 01:52:08.455 region:rollup2
PROCESS ISSUES --

01:52:05.619 --> 01:52:10.791 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:52:08.455 --> 01:52:12.292 region:rollup2
MONETIZING INJURY.

01:52:10.791 --> 01:52:15.362 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE OCCURRING IN TORT

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:15.996 region:rollup2
FAMILY LAW DOES NOT SAID --

01:52:15.362 --> 01:52:16.296 region:rollup2
AND TORE IT WE DON'T HAVE JURIES

01:52:15.996 --> 01:52:20.100 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:52:16.296 --> 01:52:21.335 region:rollup2
AND WE SUPPORTED THROUGHOUT THE

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:22.669 region:rollup2
PROCESS EARLY ON AND THROUGHOUT

01:52:21.335 --> 01:52:25.138 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS.

01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:26.940 region:rollup2
MAKING IT EASIER PATHWAY FOR

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:30.277 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS. TO

01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:31.812 region:rollup2
GET INTO THE THE TORT SYSTEM TO

01:52:30.277 --> 01:52:33.347 region:rollup2
GET THE HELP THEY NEED THERE.

01:52:31.812 --> 01:52:35.082 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN HAVING THIS KIND OF

01:52:33.347 --> 01:52:36.416 region:rollup2
BLANKET TREATMENT I UNDERSTAND

01:52:35.082 --> 01:52:37.884 region:rollup2
EVERYONE'S CONCERNS REGARDING

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:38.819 region:rollup2
THIS I JUST HAVE GENUINE CONCERN

01:52:37.884 --> 01:52:40.153 region:rollup2
FOR THE VICTIMS.

01:52:38.819 --> 01:52:41.989 region:rollup2
WHEN THE ABUSERS FIND OUT THE

01:52:40.153 --> 01:52:42.289 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S

01:52:41.989 --> 01:52:46.193 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:52:42.289 --> 01:52:48.962 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:52:46.193 --> 01:52:50.464 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

01:52:48.962 --> 01:52:52.199 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SING NONE.

01:52:50.464 --> 01:52:53.734 region:rollup2
SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE.

01:52:52.199 --> 01:52:55.736 region:rollup2
WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

01:52:57.104 --> 01:53:01.275 region:rollup2
AND I'M THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:52:59.072 --> 01:53:02.309 region:rollup2
THE THE CHALLENGES --

01:53:01.275 --> 01:53:06.013 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY HOWEVER THAT.

01:53:02.309 --> 01:53:08.882 region:rollup2
ON WE ESTABLISH A BAR THAT

01:53:06.013 --> 01:53:11.551 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A CRIMINAL CONVICTION.

01:53:08.882 --> 01:53:13.320 region:rollup2
THAT AFFORDS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:15.489 region:rollup2
TO AN ALLEGED ABUSER.

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:17.257 region:rollup2
IT ALSO CAN INFORM A FAMILY

01:53:15.489 --> 01:53:18.659 region:rollup2
COURT AS TO A VERY HIGH STANDARD

01:53:17.257 --> 01:53:20.360 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST STANDARD.

01:53:18.659 --> 01:53:22.029 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF DETERMINING GUILT

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:23.864 region:rollup2
INDIANS INNOCENTS WE'RE TOLD

01:53:22.029 --> 01:53:26.233 region:rollup2
THAT THE NO FAULT SYSTEM IN

01:53:23.864 --> 01:53:28.735 region:rollup2
FAMILY LAW IS SACROSANCT IN THIS

01:53:26.233 --> 01:53:30.570 region:rollup2
WILL UPSET NO FAULT SYSTEM.

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:32.973 region:rollup2
FRIENDS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:34.941 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHERE SOMEBODY HAS BEEN

01:53:32.973 --> 01:53:37.477 region:rollup2
FOUND GUILTY OF FAULT IN A

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:39.346 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL PROCEEDING --

01:53:37.477 --> 01:53:41.615 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTED MURDER --

01:53:39.346 --> 01:53:44.484 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ASSAULT FELONIES

01:53:41.615 --> 01:53:46.453 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY PROTECT THE VICTIM

01:53:44.484 --> 01:53:48.088 region:rollup2
FROM THE ABUSER BENEFITING

01:53:46.453 --> 01:53:49.856 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY FROM THAT.

01:53:48.088 --> 01:53:51.525 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:53:49.856 --> 01:53:53.760 region:rollup2
KILEY AYE DON'T THINK WAS WAS

01:53:51.525 --> 01:53:55.796 region:rollup2
FULLY ANSWERED WE DON'T HAVE

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:59.132 region:rollup2
THAT I AM AWARE OF ANY DATA.

01:53:55.796 --> 01:54:00.534 region:rollup2
OF HOW THAT'S ADVERSELY IMPACTED

01:53:59.132 --> 01:54:02.069 region:rollup2
VICTIMS --

01:54:00.534 --> 01:54:04.538 region:rollup2
OUR HOPE IS THAT IT DOES

01:54:02.069 --> 01:54:07.207 region:rollup2
ADVERSELY IMPACT A CONVICTED

01:54:04.538 --> 01:54:08.942 region:rollup2
FELON WHO'S ENGAGED IN SEXUAL

01:54:07.207 --> 01:54:10.477 region:rollup2
ASSAULT OR ATTEMPTED MURDER WE

01:54:08.942 --> 01:54:12.646 region:rollup2
THINK THAT SAME STANDARD SHOULD

01:54:10.477 --> 01:54:13.213 region:rollup2
APPLY TO ANYONE CONVICTED OF A

01:54:12.646 --> 01:54:13.847 region:rollup2
FELONY.

01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:16.383 region:rollup2
HOW THIS IMPACTS CRIMINAL COURTS

01:54:13.847 --> 01:54:19.319 region:rollup2
--

01:54:16.383 --> 01:54:21.521 region:rollup2
IN PLEA BARGAINING A IT.

01:54:19.319 --> 01:54:23.890 region:rollup2
PERHAPS WILL GIVE A PROSECUTOR

01:54:21.521 --> 01:54:26.059 region:rollup2
SOME LEVERAGE TO SECURE --

01:54:23.890 --> 01:54:29.196 region:rollup2
A PLEA FOR A MISDEMEANOR SO THAT

01:54:26.059 --> 01:54:30.697 region:rollup2
THE FOR THE THE PERSON ACCUSED

01:54:29.196 --> 01:54:32.699 region:rollup2
OF A FELONY --

01:54:30.697 --> 01:54:33.934 region:rollup2
HAS AN OPTION TO APPEAL TO THE

01:54:32.699 --> 01:54:35.836 region:rollup2
DISCRETION OF THE COURT I DON'T

01:54:33.934 --> 01:54:37.137 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY BAD IN

01:54:35.836 --> 01:54:40.240 region:rollup2
TERMS OF OPENING UP FOR

01:54:37.137 --> 01:54:41.208 region:rollup2
PROTECTION IT'S WITH A

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:43.176 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR.

01:54:41.208 --> 01:54:45.178 region:rollup2
PLEA -- IN A

01:54:43.176 --> 01:54:46.713 region:rollup2
FELONY SITUATION BUT THE PURPOSE

01:54:45.178 --> 01:54:48.615 region:rollup2
OF THIS LAW.

01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:51.051 region:rollup2
IS NOT TO DICTATE HOW CRIMINAL

01:54:48.615 --> 01:54:52.853 region:rollup2
DEFENSE FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION

01:54:51.051 --> 01:54:54.387 region:rollup2
FULFILLS IN THEIR JOB --

01:54:52.853 --> 01:54:56.723 region:rollup2
I DO THINK WOULD BE INCUMBENT ON

01:54:54.387 --> 01:54:59.226 region:rollup2
THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY TO MAKE --

01:54:56.723 --> 01:55:00.060 region:rollup2
HIS OR HER CLIENT FULLY AWARE OF

01:54:59.226 --> 01:55:02.896 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FAMILY LAW

01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:04.865 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS THEY ALREADY EXIST

01:55:02.896 --> 01:55:05.599 region:rollup2
UNDER EXISTING LAW FOR SEXUAL

01:55:04.865 --> 01:55:07.834 region:rollup2
ASSAULT.

01:55:05.599 --> 01:55:09.569 region:rollup2
OR ATTEMPTED MURDER WE THINK IT

01:55:07.834 --> 01:55:11.204 region:rollup2
SHOULD APPLY TO ALL FELONIES WE

01:55:09.569 --> 01:55:12.205 region:rollup2
THINK THAT SUGGEST IT'S

01:55:11.204 --> 01:55:14.474 region:rollup2
EQUITABLE.

01:55:12.205 --> 01:55:16.209 region:rollup2
AND AT THE CORE OF THIS.

01:55:14.474 --> 01:55:18.278 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTING PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN

01:55:16.209 --> 01:55:20.480 region:rollup2

01:55:30.257 --> 01:55:35.095 region:rollup2
EXTEND THAT TO OTHER CLASSES OF

01:55:32.692 --> 01:55:36.430 region:rollup2
VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:55:35.095 --> 01:55:38.231 region:rollup2

02:07:07.954 --> 02:07:11.824 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS FOUND --

02:07:09.822 --> 02:07:13.159 region:rollup2
AS THE LA NOW STANDS A COURT IS

02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:14.994 region:rollup2
GIVEN DISCRETION TO AVOID

02:07:13.159 --> 02:07:15.528 region:rollup2
RESULTS OF AN ELECTION EVEN

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:16.496 region:rollup2
AFTER VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN

02:07:15.528 --> 02:07:17.964 region:rollup2
FOUND.

02:07:16.496 --> 02:07:19.499 region:rollup2
AND IN THOSE INSTANCES IT KEEPS

02:07:17.964 --> 02:07:20.666 region:rollup2
THE BURDEN ON THE DISSENTING

02:07:19.499 --> 02:07:22.435 region:rollup2
MEMBER TO PROVE THAT THE

02:07:20.666 --> 02:07:24.070 region:rollup2
ELECTION WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN

02:07:22.435 --> 02:07:24.837 region:rollup2
SHOWN TO VIOLATE THE PROCEDURES.

02:07:24.070 --> 02:07:26.572 region:rollup2
I'M WHETHER NOT THAT SHOULD BE

02:07:24.837 --> 02:07:29.308 region:rollup2
AVOIDED THE AMENDED THAT'S BEEN

02:07:26.572 --> 02:07:29.842 region:rollup2
PROPOSED UNDER.

02:07:29.308 --> 02:07:30.576 region:rollup2
FIFTY ONE FORTY FIVE EIGHT

02:07:29.842 --> 02:07:32.411 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SHIFT THAT BURDEN TO

02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:34.213 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATIONS AND IT MAY COULD

02:07:32.411 --> 02:07:36.015 region:rollup2
MANDATORY THAT IT SHALL BE.

02:07:34.213 --> 02:07:37.550 region:rollup2
VOIDED UNLESS THE ASSOCIATION

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:39.485 region:rollup2
CAN SHOW THAT THE VIOLATIONS

02:07:37.550 --> 02:07:41.120 region:rollup2
WERE A UNINTENDED IN NON

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:42.889 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENTIAL.

02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:43.990 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT IS A MUCH

02:07:42.889 --> 02:07:45.558 region:rollup2
FAIRER --

02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:47.960 region:rollup2
WAY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THE

02:07:45.558 --> 02:07:49.061 region:rollup2
LIES WRITTEN I BELIEVE HAS NO

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:51.464 region:rollup2
TEETH AND I URGE THAT AMENDMENT

02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:52.565 region:rollup2
TO PASS --

02:07:51.464 --> 02:07:54.700 region:rollup2
AND JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND

02:07:52.565 --> 02:07:55.801 region:rollup2
THE THE PROVISION IS ENTITLED

02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:57.503 region:rollup2
THE JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT OF

02:07:55.801 --> 02:07:58.771 region:rollup2
ELECTION PROCEDURES.

02:07:57.503 --> 02:08:00.806 region:rollup2
AND WOOD BURKE DECISION

02:07:58.771 --> 02:08:02.175 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT WHILE

02:08:00.806 --> 02:08:03.376 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS MAY BE RELEVANT

02:08:02.175 --> 02:08:04.377 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY ITS HANDS WERE TIED

02:08:03.376 --> 02:08:05.545 region:rollup2
BECAUSE DISCRETION AS WITH THE

02:08:04.377 --> 02:08:06.612 region:rollup2
COURTS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO

02:08:05.545 --> 02:08:07.847 region:rollup2
AVOID IT I THINK.

02:08:06.612 --> 02:08:09.081 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS --

02:08:07.847 --> 02:08:10.116 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE MORE THAN RELEVANT

02:08:09.081 --> 02:08:12.218 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD CARRY THE DAY I

02:08:10.116 --> 02:08:13.019 region:rollup2
THINK THE OPINION.

02:08:12.218 --> 02:08:14.887 region:rollup2
WHAT SORT OF THE TAIL WAGGING

02:08:13.019 --> 02:08:15.655 region:rollup2
THE DOG BUT AS TO THAT POINTSO

02:08:14.887 --> 02:08:17.056 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT IT'S VERY

02:08:15.655 --> 02:08:18.524 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE THAT THE ASSOCIATION

02:08:17.056 --> 02:08:19.592 region:rollup2
SHOULD BEAR THAT BURDEN?

02:08:18.524 --> 02:08:20.426 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TO SHOW BY

02:08:19.592 --> 02:08:23.296 region:rollup2
A PREPONDERANCE THAT THE

02:08:20.426 --> 02:08:24.363 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS.

02:08:23.296 --> 02:08:26.265 region:rollup2
BUT THE VIOLATIONS WERE IN FACT

02:08:24.363 --> 02:08:28.901 region:rollup2
UNINTENTIONAL AND NON CONSERVE

02:08:26.265 --> 02:08:29.936 region:rollup2

FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE

AND I'M FOR DISCUSSING THESE

02:10:20.713 --> 02:10:24.684 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH US ON THIS BILL.

02:10:22.181 --> 02:10:27.753 region:rollup2
AND WE APPRECIATE THE REMOVAL OF

02:10:24.684 --> 02:10:30.790 region:rollup2
THE COPYING OF THE BALLOTS AND

02:10:27.753 --> 02:10:32.258 region:rollup2
OF THE SIGNATURE ENVELOPES THAT

02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:33.526 region:rollup2
WAS A HUGE PRIVACY ISSUE FOR US.

02:10:32.258 --> 02:10:34.760 region:rollup2
EVEN WITHOUT AMENDMENT THOUGH

02:10:33.526 --> 02:10:36.195 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL HAVE TO

02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:38.197 region:rollup2
REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL.

02:10:36.195 --> 02:10:39.632 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS

02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:40.499 region:rollup2
WITH THE LIMITATIONS THAT THIS

02:10:39.632 --> 02:10:42.835 region:rollup2
BILL PLACES ON THE

02:10:40.499 --> 02:10:44.437 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATIONS OF WHO CAN BE ON

02:10:42.835 --> 02:10:44.970 region:rollup2
THE BOARD --

02:10:44.437 --> 02:10:47.106 region:rollup2
WE APPRECIATE SOME OF THE

02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:48.941 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS THAT WORK FOR SOME

02:10:47.106 --> 02:10:50.643 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS ON WHO CAN RUN FOR

02:10:48.941 --> 02:10:52.178 region:rollup2
THE BOARD BUT WE DO THINK THAT

02:10:50.643 --> 02:10:53.546 region:rollup2
THE BOARDS AND THE MEMBERS OF

02:10:52.178 --> 02:10:54.714 region:rollup2
THESE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS.

02:10:53.546 --> 02:10:56.182 region:rollup2
SHOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME

02:10:54.714 --> 02:10:57.483 region:rollup2
DISCRETION SHOULD OTHER ISSUES

02:10:56.182 --> 02:10:58.684 region:rollup2
ARISE -- WE

02:10:57.483 --> 02:11:01.020 region:rollup2
HAD DISCUSSED --

02:10:58.684 --> 02:11:02.488 region:rollup2
AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW

02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:04.223 region:rollup2
FOR FUTURE QUALIFICATIONS TO BE

02:11:02.488 --> 02:11:06.092 region:rollup2
DONE THROUGH THE BY LAWS SO THAT

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:07.993 region:rollup2
WAS IT WAS A VOTE OF THE ENTIRE.

02:11:06.092 --> 02:11:09.829 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS IT ASSOCIATION WE

02:11:07.993 --> 02:11:11.564 region:rollup2
WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE IN

02:11:09.829 --> 02:11:13.132 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR TO STILL CONTINUE --

02:11:11.564 --> 02:11:14.967 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY PROVIDING THAT

02:11:13.132 --> 02:11:16.535 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION FOR BOARD MEMBERS --

02:11:14.967 --> 02:11:17.770 region:rollup2
FEATHER ISSUES ARISE WE ALSO ARE

02:11:16.535 --> 02:11:19.505 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT ONE OF THE

02:11:17.770 --> 02:11:20.973 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATIONS DOES ADDRESS

02:11:19.505 --> 02:11:23.409 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO'S NOT UP TO DATE ON

02:11:20.973 --> 02:11:25.378 region:rollup2
REGULAR ASSESSMENTS BUT DOES NOT

02:11:23.409 --> 02:11:26.879 region:rollup2
INCLUDE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS --

02:11:25.378 --> 02:11:28.814 region:rollup2
IF A MEMBER IS NOT PAYING THEIR

02:11:26.879 --> 02:11:29.982 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS THE REST OF

02:11:28.814 --> 02:11:30.950 region:rollup2
THE HOMEOWNERS HAVE TO PICK UP

02:11:29.982 --> 02:11:31.717 region:rollup2
THAT TAB.

02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:32.985 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:11:31.717 --> 02:11:34.286 region:rollup2
SOMEONE RUNNING FOR THE BOARD

02:11:32.985 --> 02:11:35.421 region:rollup2
AND BEING ON THE BOARD WHEN

02:11:34.286 --> 02:11:37.289 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALSO NOT PAYING THEIR

02:11:35.421 --> 02:11:38.858 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS --

02:11:37.289 --> 02:11:40.626 region:rollup2
WE FURTHER HAVE CONCERNS WITH

02:11:38.858 --> 02:11:43.229 region:rollup2
THE SHIFTING OF THE BURDEN.

02:11:40.626 --> 02:11:44.396 region:rollup2
I'M WE BELIEVE THAT IF A MEMBER

02:11:43.229 --> 02:11:46.132 region:rollup2
BELIEVES THAT SOMETHING WAS

02:11:44.396 --> 02:11:47.233 region:rollup2
WRONG WITH THE ELECTION THAT

02:11:46.132 --> 02:11:48.601 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WAS DONE UNFAIRLY.

02:11:47.233 --> 02:11:50.336 region:rollup2
AMAR THAT PROCEDURE WASN'T

02:11:48.601 --> 02:11:51.637 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED THEY SHOULD HAVE THE

02:11:50.336 --> 02:11:53.339 region:rollup2
BURDEN TO PROVE.

02:11:51.637 --> 02:11:54.740 region:rollup2
THAT -- THAT

02:11:53.339 --> 02:11:56.342 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE CASE AND THAT IT

02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:57.877 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ON THE ASSOCIATION TO

02:11:56.342 --> 02:11:59.412 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PROVE THAT SOMETHING

02:11:57.877 --> 02:12:01.113 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S AN

02:11:59.412 --> 02:12:02.581 region:rollup2
ODD SHIFT TO HAVE THEM PROVING A

02:12:01.113 --> 02:12:03.949 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE --

02:12:02.581 --> 02:12:05.885 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN THAT WE JUST HAVE

02:12:03.949 --> 02:12:07.853 region:rollup2
OTHER CONCERNS WITH --

02:12:05.885 --> 02:12:10.289 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT MAY RAISE THE COST

02:12:07.853 --> 02:12:11.924 region:rollup2
TO HOMEOWNERS CERTAINLY ACTION

02:12:10.289 --> 02:12:14.927 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES ON THE PAYING OF AN

02:12:11.924 --> 02:12:17.329 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY CONSULTATION FEE --

02:12:14.927 --> 02:12:19.432 region:rollup2
AND WHILE WE SUPPORT FAIR

02:12:17.329 --> 02:12:21.167 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:12:19.432 --> 02:12:22.535 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS NO WRONGDOING WE

02:12:21.167 --> 02:12:24.136 region:rollup2
ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:12:22.535 --> 02:12:25.771 region:rollup2
UNDUE BURDENS AND I DO COSTS ARE

02:12:24.136 --> 02:12:27.139 region:rollup2
NOT PLACED ON THE HOMEOWNERS FOR

02:12:25.771 --> 02:12:28.073 region:rollup2
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE

02:12:27.139 --> 02:12:29.542 region:rollup2
JUROR NO VOTE [inaudible]

DURING MY SENIOR YEAR IN COLLEGE

SHE GREETED ME AT THE FRONT DOOR

02:20:07.165 --> 02:20:09.868 region:rollup2
THEN QUICKLY LEFT AFTER SHE

02:20:08.433 --> 02:20:11.904 region:rollup2

02:20:22.414 --> 02:20:25.117 region:rollup2
THE FLOOR.

02:20:24.049 --> 02:20:26.485 region:rollup2
THERE WERE A LOT OF MATTRESSES

02:20:25.117 --> 02:20:28.253 region:rollup2
ON THE FLOOR IN THE SEVENTIES SO

02:20:26.485 --> 02:20:29.755 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT.

02:20:28.253 --> 02:20:31.323 region:rollup2
HE BRAGGED ABOUT HIS SUCCESS IN

02:20:29.755 --> 02:20:33.158 region:rollup2
NEW YORK IS A JINGLE WRITER FOR

02:20:31.323 --> 02:20:34.426 region:rollup2
COMMERCIALS AND ASKED ME TO READ

02:20:33.158 --> 02:20:36.161 region:rollup2
A SCENE FROM THE DOG EARED

02:20:34.426 --> 02:20:37.763 region:rollup2
SCRIPT HE HANDED ME WHILE HE

02:20:36.161 --> 02:20:39.164 region:rollup2
FILMED MY AUDITION FROM BEHIND

02:20:37.763 --> 02:20:40.532 region:rollup2
THE CAMERA.

02:20:39.164 --> 02:20:42.267 region:rollup2
HE THEN ASKED ME TO REMOVE MY

02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:44.036 region:rollup2
GLASSES BECAUSE HE SAID THEY

02:20:42.267 --> 02:20:45.737 region:rollup2
WERE CAUSING A GLARE.

02:20:44.036 --> 02:20:47.506 region:rollup2
I COULD STILL READ BUT EXTREMELY

02:20:45.737 --> 02:20:49.041 region:rollup2
BUT BEING EXTREMELY NEARSIGHTED

02:20:47.506 --> 02:20:51.777 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM INCLUDING

02:20:49.041 --> 02:20:53.445 region:rollup2
HIM WAS FUZZY AND INDISTINCT.

02:20:51.777 --> 02:20:55.480 region:rollup2
I GAVE THE SAME MY ALL AND HE

02:20:53.445 --> 02:20:57.049 region:rollup2
TOLD ME I'VE GOT IT.

02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:58.216 region:rollup2
AND THEN HE ASKED ME TO TAKE OFF

02:20:57.049 --> 02:21:00.018 region:rollup2
MY CLOTHES FOR THE LOVE SCENE

02:20:58.216 --> 02:21:01.820 region:rollup2
THAT WAS NEXT. TO PROVE MY

02:21:00.018 --> 02:21:03.355 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALISM.

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:04.890 region:rollup2
I MEEKLY ARGUED WITH HIM A

02:21:03.355 --> 02:21:06.458 region:rollup2
LITTLE BUT I WANTED TO PROVE

02:21:04.890 --> 02:21:08.293 region:rollup2
THAT I COULD BE A PROFESSIONAL

02:21:06.458 --> 02:21:10.329 region:rollup2
ACTRESS WHO TO THE DEMANDS OF

02:21:08.293 --> 02:21:11.930 region:rollup2
THE ROLE SERIOUSLY.

02:21:10.329 --> 02:21:12.230 region:rollup2
AND WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM ON SET

02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:14.099 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:15.334 region:rollup2
LOOKING BACK

02:21:14.099 --> 02:21:17.002 region:rollup2
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN

02:21:15.334 --> 02:21:19.838 region:rollup2
SUSPICIOUS BUT I TRUSTED HIS

02:21:17.002 --> 02:21:21.840 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE AND SUCCESS HAVING NO

02:21:19.838 --> 02:21:23.842 region:rollup2
ADDITION ING EXPERIENCE MYSELF

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:25.377 region:rollup2
IN THE PROFESSIONAL WORLD.

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:26.511 region:rollup2
I RELUCTANTLY TOOK MY CLOTHES

02:21:25.377 --> 02:21:27.079 region:rollup2
OFF.

02:21:26.511 --> 02:21:28.647 region:rollup2
AND HE PUT THEM SOMEWHERE I

02:21:27.079 --> 02:21:29.247 region:rollup2
COULDN'T SEE.

02:21:28.647 --> 02:21:30.882 region:rollup2
I CONTINUED READING FROM THE

02:21:29.247 --> 02:21:32.784 region:rollup2
SCRIPT.

02:21:30.882 --> 02:21:34.219 region:rollup2
THEN I HEARD THE DISTINCT SOUND

02:21:32.784 --> 02:21:35.687 region:rollup2
OF HIS ZIPPER BEING UNDONE AND

02:21:34.219 --> 02:21:37.189 region:rollup2
SAW THROUGH THE FOG OF MY BAD

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:38.590 region:rollup2
EYESIGHT HIM ADVANCING TOWARDS

02:21:37.189 --> 02:21:39.725 region:rollup2
ME.

02:21:38.590 --> 02:21:41.426 region:rollup2
HE PINNED ME DOWN ON THE

02:21:39.725 --> 02:21:44.429 region:rollup2
MATTRESS AND I FROZE FEELING

02:21:41.426 --> 02:21:45.564 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY ALONE AND TERRIFIED.

02:21:44.429 --> 02:21:47.432 region:rollup2
I SOBBED HYSTERICALLY AS HE

02:21:45.564 --> 02:21:48.700 region:rollup2
RAPED ME.

02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:51.003 region:rollup2
AFTERWARDS HE COULD UNDERSTAND

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:52.471 region:rollup2
WHY I WAS SO UPSET TELLING ME

02:21:51.003 --> 02:21:53.672 region:rollup2
THAT I'D DONE A GREAT JOB AND I

02:21:52.471 --> 02:21:55.841 region:rollup2
WAS A STRONG CONTENDER TO WIN

02:21:53.672 --> 02:21:58.010 region:rollup2
THE ROLE.

02:21:55.841 --> 02:21:59.711 region:rollup2
WELL I WAS ALTERED MY WORLD

02:21:58.010 --> 02:22:02.080 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY SHATTERED.

02:21:59.711 --> 02:22:03.148 region:rollup2
FEAR AND DISTRUST OF LIFE ITSELF

02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:04.750 region:rollup2
BECAME EMBEDDED INTO MY VERY

02:22:03.148 --> 02:22:06.451 region:rollup2
SOUL.

02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:07.819 region:rollup2
I BLAME MYSELF FOR WHAT HE HAS

02:22:06.451 --> 02:22:09.388 region:rollup2
DONE TO ME THINKING THAT IT WAS

02:22:07.819 --> 02:22:10.789 region:rollup2
MY FAULT.

02:22:09.388 --> 02:22:13.725 region:rollup2
I KILLED MY THREE BEST FRIENDS

02:22:10.789 --> 02:22:15.694 region:rollup2
AND NO ONE ELSE. FOR YEARS I

02:22:13.725 --> 02:22:17.129 region:rollup2
REPRESS THE EXPERIENCE BUT IT

02:22:15.694 --> 02:22:20.465 region:rollup2
HAD UNDENIABLE AFFECTS ON MY

02:22:17.129 --> 02:22:22.534 region:rollup2
CAREER AND PERSONAL LIFE.

02:22:20.465 --> 02:22:24.536 region:rollup2
I STOP DANCING WITHOUT KNOWING

02:22:22.534 --> 02:22:26.104 region:rollup2
IT I FELL APART IN AUDITIONS BUT

02:22:24.536 --> 02:22:28.040 region:rollup2
I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY.

02:22:26.104 --> 02:22:29.808 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MYSELF FOR A

02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:30.976 region:rollup2
LONG PERIOD OF TIME I NEVER GAVE

02:22:29.808 --> 02:22:33.211 region:rollup2
UP ON MY DREAM OF BEING AN

02:22:30.976 --> 02:22:34.479 region:rollup2
ACTRESS BUT I COULD ONLY HALF

02:22:33.211 --> 02:22:36.648 region:rollup2
HEARTEDLY PURSUED IT.

02:22:34.479 --> 02:22:38.116 region:rollup2
I WAS SO AFRAID YEARS OF

02:22:36.648 --> 02:22:40.685 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND EFFORT WERE

02:22:38.116 --> 02:22:42.421 region:rollup2
UNDERMINED BY THIS ONE EVENT.

02:22:40.685 --> 02:22:43.722 region:rollup2
I ULTIMATELY CONTINUED ON IN THE

02:22:42.421 --> 02:22:45.023 region:rollup2
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AS A

02:22:43.722 --> 02:22:46.591 region:rollup2
CASTING DIRECTOR.

02:22:45.023 --> 02:22:49.828 region:rollup2
FINDING SAFETY AND A PURPOSE

02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:50.395 region:rollup2
BEHIND MY DESK IN TWO THOUSAND

02:22:49.828 --> 02:22:51.196 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN I CAME ACROSS AN

02:22:50.395 --> 02:22:52.697 region:rollup2
ARTICLE.

02:22:51.196 --> 02:22:54.533 region:rollup2
ABOUT AN OSCAR WINNING SONG

02:22:52.697 --> 02:22:56.068 region:rollup2
WRITER AND DIRECTOR WOULD KILL

02:22:54.533 --> 02:22:57.736 region:rollup2
HIMSELF WHILE AWAITING TRIAL FOR

02:22:56.068 --> 02:22:59.037 region:rollup2
RAPING YOUNG ACTRESSES AT

02:22:57.736 --> 02:23:01.073 region:rollup2
PHONING AUDITIONS IN NEW YORK

02:22:59.037 --> 02:23:02.407 region:rollup2
CITY.

02:23:01.073 --> 02:23:04.176 region:rollup2
LIKE A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO

02:23:02.407 --> 02:23:05.844 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING I BEGAN TO SEE THE

02:23:04.176 --> 02:23:07.212 region:rollup2
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE MAN'S

02:23:05.844 --> 02:23:08.780 region:rollup2
METHODS AND THOSE OF THE MAN WHO

02:23:07.212 --> 02:23:10.282 region:rollup2
RAPED ME.

02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:11.817 region:rollup2
WHEN I SAW HIS PHOTO A VIOLENT

02:23:10.282 --> 02:23:12.350 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL REACTION COURSE THROUGH

02:23:11.817 --> 02:23:14.486 region:rollup2
MY BODY ALMOST FORTY YEARS

02:23:12.350 --> 02:23:15.987 region:rollup2
LATER?

02:23:14.486 --> 02:23:18.190 region:rollup2
I KNEW I WAS LOOKING AT THE FACE

02:23:15.987 --> 02:23:20.459 region:rollup2
OF MY RAPIST.

02:23:18.190 --> 02:23:23.028 region:rollup2
AFTER LEARNING WHO HE REALLY WAS

02:23:20.459 --> 02:23:24.930 region:rollup2
A SERIAL RAPIST I WAS RELEASED

02:23:23.028 --> 02:23:26.765 region:rollup2
RELEASED FROM MY SELF IMPOSED

02:23:24.930 --> 02:23:28.233 region:rollup2
PRISON OF SHAME.

02:23:26.765 --> 02:23:30.802 region:rollup2
I FINALLY REALIZE THAT WHAT HAD

02:23:28.233 --> 02:23:33.004 region:rollup2
HAPPENED TO ME WAS NOT MY FAULT.

02:23:30.802 --> 02:23:34.239 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO FELT IMMEASURABLY SAD

02:23:33.004 --> 02:23:35.640 region:rollup2
FOR HIS DOZENS OF OTHER VICTIMS

02:23:34.239 --> 02:23:37.609 region:rollup2
AN ANGRY THAT HE WAS NEVER

02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:40.011 region:rollup2
BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.

02:23:37.609 --> 02:23:43.114 region:rollup2
SO I BEGAN TO SPEAK OUT GOT MY

02:23:40.011 --> 02:23:45.117 region:rollup2
LIFE AND RIGHTFUL CAREER BACK.

02:23:43.114 --> 02:23:46.751 region:rollup2
MY STORY TRAGICALLY IS NOT

02:23:45.117 --> 02:23:48.253 region:rollup2
UNIQUE OR UNCOMMON IN THE

02:23:46.751 --> 02:23:50.121 region:rollup2
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY OR IN

02:23:48.253 --> 02:23:52.123 region:rollup2
NEARLY ANY INDUSTRY.

02:23:50.121 --> 02:23:53.692 region:rollup2
ACROSS FIELDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

02:23:52.123 --> 02:23:55.360 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF POWER

02:23:53.692 --> 02:23:57.562 region:rollup2
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE THEY ARE

02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:59.364 region:rollup2
THERE TO MENTOR HELP AND

02:23:57.562 --> 02:24:00.632 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE IN THEIR CAREERS.

02:23:59.364 --> 02:24:02.434 region:rollup2
THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE

02:24:00.632 --> 02:24:05.036 region:rollup2
WHO ARE TRUSTING AND VULNERABLE

02:24:02.434 --> 02:24:06.238 region:rollup2
LIKE I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES.

02:24:05.036 --> 02:24:08.507 region:rollup2
THESE PREDATORS MUST BE HELD

02:24:06.238 --> 02:24:10.108 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE AND NO LONGER ABLE

WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

03:30:09.030 --> 03:30:13.267 region:rollup2
THOSE SAFETIES FOR ANYONE COMING

03:30:13.334 --> 03:30:17.839 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE ONE OF THOSE SAFE

03:30:15.069 --> 03:30:19.240 region:rollup2
PLACES SAFE HAVENS FOR ANYBODY.

03:30:17.839 --> 03:30:20.641 region:rollup2
ALSO WANTED TO SHARE ONE

03:30:19.240 --> 03:30:22.877 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CASE WHERE THE ONLY

03:30:20.641 --> 03:30:24.445 region:rollup2
WITNESS TO A VERY IMPORTANT

03:30:22.877 --> 03:30:26.247 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL CASE [inaudible]

03:30:24.445 --> 03:30:27.548 region:rollup2
WASN'T UNDOCUMENTED.

03:30:26.247 --> 03:30:29.684 region:rollup2
AND HE WAS NOT GOING TO COME

03:30:27.548 --> 03:30:31.953 region:rollup2
FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT

03:30:29.684 --> 03:30:33.955 region:rollup2
THERE WAS THE ISSUE OF HIS --

03:30:31.953 --> 03:30:35.456 region:rollup2
IMMIGRATION STATUS.

03:30:33.955 --> 03:30:37.725 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T UNTIL HE WAS SURE THAT

03:30:35.456 --> 03:30:39.527 region:rollup2
THAT WAS NOT THE ISSUE IT WAS

03:30:37.725 --> 03:30:41.662 region:rollup2
HIS I WITNESS RECOUNT THAT WAS

03:30:39.527 --> 03:30:42.296 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE.

03:30:41.662 --> 03:30:43.731 region:rollup2
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THAT

03:30:42.296 --> 03:30:44.565 region:rollup2
CASE.

03:30:43.731 --> 03:30:46.467 region:rollup2
HE CAME FORWARD IN IT WAS

03:30:44.565 --> 03:30:48.002 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF HIS RECOUNTING OF THE

03:30:46.467 --> 03:30:49.837 region:rollup2
FACTS.

03:30:48.002 --> 03:30:51.739 region:rollup2
THAT THE PERSON THAT NEEDED TO

03:30:49.837 --> 03:30:53.407 region:rollup2
BE CONVICTED WAS CONVICTED.

03:30:51.739 --> 03:30:54.876 region:rollup2
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE

03:30:53.407 --> 03:30:56.777 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT

03:30:54.876 --> 03:30:58.112 region:rollup2

SPACE WERE THE ISSUE OF YOUR

03:31:06.954 --> 03:31:09.657 region:rollup2
IMMIGRATION STATUS IS NOT WHAT'S

WHEN MY SUPPORT TO THIS BILL --

03:31:29.577 --> 03:31:32.446 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY ALSO BELIEVE THAT IF

03:31:31.612 --> 03:31:34.315 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE REAL JUSTICE

03:31:32.446 --> 03:31:35.116 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LAW WE NEED TO MAKE

03:31:34.315 --> 03:31:35.950 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THAT IS TRUE FOR

03:31:35.116 --> 03:31:37.485 region:rollup2
EVERYONE.

03:31:35.950 --> 03:31:41.289 region:rollup2
AS A FORMER CRIMINAL PROSECUTOR

03:31:37.485 --> 03:31:42.523 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE FUNDAMENTALLY THAT IF

03:31:41.289 --> 03:31:44.292 region:rollup2
NOT EVERYONE THE COMMUNITY FEELS

03:31:42.523 --> 03:31:46.027 region:rollup2
LIKE THEY CAN ACCESS OUR COURTS

03:31:44.292 --> 03:31:47.261 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT HAVE JUSTICE FOR ALL.

03:31:46.027 --> 03:31:48.129 region:rollup2
AND DOES YOUR LOT OF THINGS I

03:31:47.261 --> 03:31:49.096 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WERE SET BY THE

03:31:48.129 --> 03:31:50.431 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION THAT --

03:31:49.096 --> 03:31:52.200 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA REFRAIN FROM

RESPONDING TO OUR ACCEPTED YOU

03:31:52.200 --> 03:31:54.402 region:rollup2
WANNA SAY THERE WAS THE

03:31:53.067 --> 03:31:56.203 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW IT'S NOT

03:31:54.402 --> 03:31:58.005 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL FOR ALL CHILDREN

03:31:56.203 --> 03:31:58.573 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A RIGHT TO EDUCATION AND

03:31:58.005 --> 03:32:01.042 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:31:58.573 --> 03:32:02.310 region:rollup2
WAS CLEARLY A A PINE ALREADY THE

03:32:01.042 --> 03:32:04.078 region:rollup2
US SUPREME COURT HAS HELD

03:32:02.310 --> 03:32:05.212 region:rollup2
REPEATEDLY THAT ALL CHILDREN

03:32:04.078 --> 03:32:06.581 region:rollup2
HAVE A RIGHT TO EDUCATION I

03:32:05.212 --> 03:32:08.282 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SET THE

03:32:06.581 --> 03:32:10.585 region:rollup2
RECORD STRAIGHT ON THAT BUT ALL

03:32:08.282 --> 03:32:10.851 region:rollup2

IMMIGRATION IN OUR COUNTRY

03:32:27.068 --> 03:32:30.171 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY THAT WILL CHANGE AT

03:32:29.537 --> 03:32:31.806 region:rollup2
SOME POINT SOON BUT UNTIL THAT

03:32:30.171 --> 03:32:32.306 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WE NEED LAWS LIKE THIS

03:32:31.806 --> 03:32:33.841 region:rollup2

OF DISCONNECT ON HOW DE HOW.

04:01:31.744 --> 04:01:35.781 region:rollup2

[inaudible]

04:01:46.292 --> 04:01:51.997 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SO ONE OF THAT.

04:01:50.029 --> 04:01:53.766 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY

04:01:51.997 --> 04:01:55.801 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IN AN URBAN SETTING IN

04:01:53.766 --> 04:01:56.369 region:rollup2
A RURAL SETTING IN AND THEN A

04:01:55.801 --> 04:01:57.436 region:rollup2
RURAL SETTING WITH A LOT OF

04:01:56.369 --> 04:01:59.672 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE.

04:01:57.436 --> 04:02:01.374 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE

04:01:59.672 --> 04:02:02.875 region:rollup2
WANTED THE LOCAL AGENCY INVOLVED

04:02:01.374 --> 04:02:03.943 region:rollup2
WHETHER WAS A SENIOR COUNTIES

04:02:02.875 --> 04:02:05.811 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ISSUE THE THE

04:02:03.943 --> 04:02:06.445 region:rollup2
FRANCHISE AGREEMENT.

04:02:05.811 --> 04:02:08.414 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ALSO HAVE

04:02:06.445 --> 04:02:09.548 region:rollup2
THE BEST PROBABLY THE BEST

04:02:08.414 --> 04:02:11.250 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING.

04:02:09.548 --> 04:02:13.219 region:rollup2
OF THE LAY OF THE LAND WHO'S

04:02:11.250 --> 04:02:13.919 region:rollup2
COLLECTING WHO'S NOT COLLECTING

04:02:13.219 --> 04:02:15.287 region:rollup2
AND WHY.

04:02:13.919 --> 04:02:16.455 region:rollup2
SORT FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS ARE

04:02:15.287 --> 04:02:17.456 region:rollup2
ENTERED INTO BY THE LOCAL

04:02:16.455 --> 04:02:18.657 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION.

04:02:17.456 --> 04:02:20.693 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TAKING SOME OF THAT

04:02:18.657 --> 04:02:22.395 region:rollup2
INTO ACCOUNT [inaudible]

04:02:20.693 --> 04:02:25.564 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

04:02:22.395 --> 04:02:26.699 region:rollup2
ANCILLARY GROUPS WHO HAVE HAVE A

04:02:25.564 --> 04:02:28.401 region:rollup2
LONG HISTORY OF COLLECTING WITH

04:02:26.699 --> 04:02:29.835 region:rollup2
THIS RECYCLABLES ARE CARDBOARD

04:02:28.401 --> 04:02:30.970 region:rollup2
KANSEN THINGS.

04:02:29.835 --> 04:02:32.004 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

04:02:30.970 --> 04:02:32.905 region:rollup2
WHEN IN SO.

04:02:32.004 --> 04:02:34.507 region:rollup2
IDEALLY ONE IN FRANCHISE

04:02:32.905 --> 04:02:36.075 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT.

04:02:34.507 --> 04:02:37.877 region:rollup2
IS ISSUED SO THEY'RE IN A GOOD

04:02:36.075 --> 04:02:38.544 region:rollup2
POSITION TO ESSENTIALLY ARBITER

04:02:37.877 --> 04:02:40.146 region:rollup2
THIS.

04:02:38.544 --> 04:02:41.480 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CHECKS AND

04:02:40.146 --> 04:02:42.615 region:rollup2
BALANCES WE WANTED TO PUT IN

04:02:41.480 --> 04:02:44.050 region:rollup2
HERE.

04:02:42.615 --> 04:02:45.384 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY THAT WAS IMPORTANT SO

04:02:44.050 --> 04:02:48.954 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:02:45.384 --> 04:02:50.523 region:rollup2
BEFORE SOMEONE IS.

04:02:48.954 --> 04:02:51.957 region:rollup2
ON THE WRONG END OF THIS THAT

04:02:50.523 --> 04:02:52.725 region:rollup2
THAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION HAS

04:02:51.957 --> 04:02:54.260 region:rollup2
HE BELIEVES THEY OWE I

04:02:52.725 --> 04:02:55.227 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S HAPPENING

04:02:54.260 --> 04:02:59.965 region:rollup2
THAT'S OKAY WITH US [inaudible]

04:02:55.227 --> 04:03:01.867 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE TRYING.

04:02:59.965 --> 04:03:03.569 region:rollup2
TO DO SOMETHING STATEWIDE THAT

04:03:01.867 --> 04:03:04.703 region:rollup2
IS AT COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT

04:03:03.569 --> 04:03:06.272 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE REGION IT COMES

04:03:04.703 --> 04:03:07.773 region:rollup2
FROM SO WE'RE TRYING.

04:03:06.272 --> 04:03:09.241 region:rollup2
TO I FIND THAT AND THEN DEALING

04:03:07.773 --> 04:03:10.709 region:rollup2
WITH AGRICULTURE THERE AGAIN

04:03:09.241 --> 04:03:12.211 region:rollup2
LOTS OF DIFFERENT NESTS.

04:03:10.709 --> 04:03:13.679 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY MOVING PARTS THERE'S

04:03:12.211 --> 04:03:15.681 region:rollup2
LOTS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

04:03:13.679 --> 04:03:17.149 region:rollup2
VALUE OF MATERIALS THAT ARE

04:03:15.681 --> 04:03:18.951 region:rollup2
COLLECTED AND DISTRIBUTED.

04:03:17.149 --> 04:03:19.585 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S A COMPLEX AREA

04:03:18.951 --> 04:03:22.655 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHY I THINK THESE KINDS

04:03:19.585 --> 04:03:24.690 region:rollup2
