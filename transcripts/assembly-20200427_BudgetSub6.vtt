00:32:58.142 --> 00:32:59.811
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:01.312
HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. WE HAVE

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:03.848
BEEN TELLING MILLIONS OF

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:05.283
CALIFORNIANS BY IMPOSING A

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.251
STATE OR MORTAR THAT THEY MUST

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:09.420
MAKE DO WITH LESS AND SO MUST

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:11.089
WE THIS NEXT BUDGET YEAR IS

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:12.623

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:13.358
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE SOME

00:33:13.424 --> 00:33:15.026
DIFFICULT DECISIONS THE NUMBER

00:33:15.093 --> 00:33:16.661
ONE THING THAT I AM HOPING TO

00:33:16.728 --> 00:33:18.996

OF THOSE STATE RESERVES ARE

00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:41.686
GOING TO HAVE TO SAY FOR FUTURE

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:43.721
YEARS- IN THE EVENT THAT THIS

00:33:43.788 --> 00:33:45.823

ABSOLUTE IMPERATIVE IN OUR

OVERALL STATE RESPONSE AND OUR

CORE SAFETY NETS THAT WE

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:05.470
DEVELOP. IF WE TAKE STEPS BACK

00:35:05.536 --> 00:35:07.872
IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WE

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:09.974
ARE DEEPENING AND WIDENING THE

00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:16.614
THAT WE ARE FACING RIGHT NOW.

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:18.449
I'D LIKE TO MENTION A FEW AREAS

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:20.318
OF I CAN MISTER CHAIR THAT WE

00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:21.986
MAY TAKE BUDGET ACTIONS

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:24.121
ULTIMATELY TO SERVE THE PURPOSE

00:35:24.188 --> 00:35:26.123
OF A FAMILY FIRST RESPONSE

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.759
RIGHT NOW. FIRST WE ARE

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:30.094
LEARNING LESSONS THROUGH THIS

00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:32.230
CRISIS ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:34.031
COMMUNITIES ON A VERY BASIC

00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:37.502
LEVEL ABOUT VERY BASIC NEEDS. I

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:39.504
WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE CAREFULLY

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:42.073
CONSIDER HOW WE FURTHER EXPAND

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:44.408
AND EXTEND FLEXIBILITY IS AN

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:46.611
OPEN UP ACCESS POINTS FOR

00:35:46.677 --> 00:35:48.546
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES

00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:50.848
PROGRAMS FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:53.150
TIME. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:54.719
TO ASSIST CALIFORNIANS IN

00:35:54.785 --> 00:35:57.955
MEETING BASIC DAILY NEEDS. THIS

00:35:58.022 --> 00:36:00.925
COULD MEAN ADOPTING THE CONTENT

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:02.360
OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:03.961
DEPARTMENTAL GUIDANCE INTO

00:36:04.028 --> 00:36:05.863
BUDGET TRAILER BILLS ON JUNE

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.766
FIFTEENTH. WE STARTED THIS YEAR

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.801
WITH A VERY STRONG PUSH TO

00:36:10.868 --> 00:36:12.737
COMBAT THE VERY DIFFICULT AND

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:15.172
PAINFUL PLIGHT OF HOMELESSNESS

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:17.141
IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WITHOUT

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:19.310
ACTIONS TO CONTINUE WHAT WE'VE

00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:21.245
DONE AS A STATE OVER THE PAST

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:24.482
FEW WEEKS AND IMPROVE UPON THEM

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:26.951
WE MOVE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:29.921
AND AGAINST A GENUINE FAMILY

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:32.690
FIRST RECOVERY EFFORT. WE WANT

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:35.793
TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED FED AND

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.796
SUPPORTED THROUGH THIS CRISIS

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:42.066
THIS IS OUR PRIORITY. SECOND MY

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:44.001
VIEW IS THAT SUPPORTING

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:45.403
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:47.838
REBUILDING OUR ECONOMY ARE ONE

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:51.442
AND THE SAME. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:53.244
WE APPLY EMPLOYEES LOW WAGE

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:55.246
WORKERS WE STIMULATE OUR

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:58.282
ECONOMY WHEN WE ADD FINANCIAL

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:00.084
INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO BECOME

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:02.320
C. N. A.'S IN NURSING HOMES WE

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:04.255
REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT WE

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:06.090
STIMULATE OUR ECONOMY AND WE

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:08.960
PROTECT PROTECT SENIORS ALL AT

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:11.028
THE SAME TIME. WHEN WE

00:37:11.095 --> 00:37:12.196
PERMANENTLY INCREASE

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:14.231
REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:16.267
TELEHEALTH WE REBUILD OUR

00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:18.736
HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE WE MAKE

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:20.404
HEALTH CARE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:22.239
CALIFORNIANS AND WE STIMULATE

00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:24.542
OUR ECONOMY. WHEN WE

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:26.310

CALIFORNIA BEING IMPACTED BY

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:15.052
THIS TO DISASTER A BIGGER

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.520
PRESENTS A VERY VERY LARGE

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:18.856
CHALLENGE WE NOW HAVE OVER

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:20.391
TWENTY SIX AMERICANS TWENTY SIX

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:22.326
MILLION AMERICANS WHO APPLIED

FOR UNEMPLOYMENT IN OVER THREE

00:39:23.961 --> 00:39:25.596
MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:27.631
APPLIED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT- WHILE

WE UNDERSTAND EVERYBODY IS

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.801
HURTING JUST THE STAFF OF.

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:32.403
COMMENTS AND EMAILS WE'VE

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.338
GOTTEN WE KNOW THAT THERE IS NO

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:36.040
SECTOR OF THE STATE THAT HAS

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:38.309
BEEN LEFT REALLY AREN'T TOUCHED

00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:40.945
BY THIS PANDEMIC TODAY WE HAVE

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:43.814
A GREAT PANEL- WE HAVE PEOPLE

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:45.649
WHO CAN GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:49.320
THE FUTURE HOLDS- DURING KOBE

00:39:49.386 --> 00:39:51.255
NINETEEN AS WELL AS AFTER A BIT

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:53.491
ALSO TALK FROM THEIR INDIVIDUAL

00:39:53.557 --> 00:39:55.326
PERSPECTIVES ABOUT HOW THINGS

00:39:55.392 --> 00:39:56.594
ARE GOING WHETHER IT'S A SMALL

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.662
BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE WHETHER

00:39:58.729 --> 00:39:59.597
IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL WORKER

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:02.900
PERSPECTIVE- WHETHER IT'S- YOU

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:04.468
KNOW JUST ONE PARTICULAR

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:06.704
BUSINESS. WE ALSO HAVE-

00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:08.372
PRESENTATIONS FROM OUR LA- AS

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:11.542
WELL AS FROM THE CALIFORNIA

00:40:11.609 --> 00:40:12.176
BUDGET POLICY CENTER SO THAT WE

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:13.544
CAN REALLY. HAVE SOME.

00:40:13.611 --> 00:40:15.679
POTENTIAL BUDGET CENTERED IDEAS

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.014
OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE ON LIKE

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:18.616
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:21.585
WE CANNOT DEFICIT SPENT- WE

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:24.855
CANNOT BORROW- WE HAVE TO PASS

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:26.157
A BALANCED BUDGET ON JUNE

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:27.291
FIFTEENTH AND WE WILL PASS A

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:29.059
BUDGET- BALANCED BUDGET ON JUNE

00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:30.494
FIFTEENTH. BUT THAT PRESENTS A

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:32.830
CHALLENGE IN LIMITS OUR ABILITY

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:34.765
TO DO ALL THE HELP THAT

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:37.701
EVERYONE IS ASKING US TO DO. SO

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:38.803
REALLY APPRECIATE AGAIN THE

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:39.670
MEMBERS FOR COMING UP

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:41.305
SACRAMENTO TODAY ND WE WILL

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:43.073
START WITH- PROFESSOR NICHOLS

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.309
BURKE WITH THE UCLA ANDERSON

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:50.447
FORECAST. PROFESSOR. THANK YOU

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.116
THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:54.151
BE HERE THIS MORNING I THOUGHT

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:55.920
IT WOULD BEGIN WAS JUST TAKING

00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:57.354
A FEW MINUTES TO GIVE AN

00:40:57.421 --> 00:41:00.424
OVERVIEW OF WHERE WE SEE THE

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:03.661
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY GOING AND

00:41:03.727 --> 00:41:06.030
NOT JUST TODAY AS WE MOVE

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:08.966
THROUGH THIS THE RECESSION BUT-

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:12.203
ALSO AS WE MOVE INTO THE FUTURE

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:13.637
AND INTO THE RECOVERY. SO LET

00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:18.776
ME. LET ME JUST BEGIN BY SAYING

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:20.311
FIRST OF ALL AS YOU ALL KNOW

00:41:20.377 --> 00:41:22.413
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST HAND

00:41:22.479 --> 00:41:24.982
DAMAGE IN HUMAN HISTORY A WE'VE

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:26.684
BEEN HAVING PANDEMICS KIND OF

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:29.253
ALL THROUGHOUT. IT IS THE

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.157
FIRST. ENDEMIC IN OUR LIFETIME.

00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:35.125
AND IT IS THE FIRST ONE SINCE

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:38.562
WE HAVE BEGUN TO COLLECT A RICH

00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:40.631
SET OF ECONOMIC DATA OR WHICH

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:42.566
WITH WHICH TO ANALYZE. AB

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:45.135
RECESSIONS. AND SO WHAT THAT

00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:47.504
MEANS IS THAT THIS IS A

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:49.473
DIFFERENT RECESSION FROM ALL OF

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.209
THOSE THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:54.445
THE POST WORLD WAR TWO ERA. ALL

00:41:54.511 --> 00:41:56.213
OF THE OTHER RECESSIONS WERE

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.115
REDUCTION IN DEMAND BECAUSE-

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.717
OVER BUILDING OF A BUILDING OF

00:41:59.783 --> 00:42:03.320
HOMES. HAVE COMPUTERS OF FENCE

00:42:03.387 --> 00:42:07.057
THE MILITARY L. AND-

00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:08.259
AUTOMOBILES AND SO ON. IN THIS

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:10.160
CASE THE REDUCTION IN DEMAND IN

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:11.695
OUR ECONOMY IS ONE THAT'S BEEN

00:42:11.762 --> 00:42:13.998
MANDATED BY THE IN EXTREME

00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:16.533
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN THAT

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.403
MAKES THE TRAJECTORY OF THIS

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.438
RECESSION A BIT DIFFERENT. IT

00:42:21.505 --> 00:42:24.308
ALSO MEANS THAT ALL THE

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.310
FORECASTS THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:28.579
THIS RECESSION AND RECOVERY I

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:30.314
BASED ON LESS DATA THAN

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:33.217
FORECAST THAT FOR EXAMPLE- WE

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:36.020
AND OTHERS PUT OUT IN TWO

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:36.553
THOUSAND NINE DURING THAT

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.955
RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND ONE

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:39.456
DURING THAT PROCESS IT IS

00:42:39.523 --> 00:42:40.958
REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:43.093
THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE USED

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.330
IN EACH AND EVERY FORECAST. SO

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:49.500
ARE IS EXPLICITLY ARE. THAT BUT

00:42:49.566 --> 00:42:51.135
IN THE SUMMER IN THE EARLY PART

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:52.202
OF THE SUMMER WILL BE ON THE

00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:54.371
BACK END OF THIS PANDEMIC CURB

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:56.440
WILL BEGIN. THE OPENING UP OF

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:58.208
THE ECONOMY WHICH WILL CONTINUE

00:42:58.275 --> 00:43:02.713
THROUGH THE SUMMER. AND THAT IN

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.347
TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE DON'T HAVE

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:05.282
A RETURN OF THE PANDEMIC. OR WE

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:07.751
HAVE- WIDESPREAD VACCINATION

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:10.054
AGAINST THAT. SO THOSE MAYBE

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.155
HERO BECAUSE SOME SENSE BUT

00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:12.456
THEY ARE ASSUMPTIONS THEY'RE

00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:15.025
NOT A FORECAST. AND TO THE

00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:15.492
EXTENT THAT THERE TOO

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:17.594
OPTIMISTIC OUR ECONOMIC

00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:21.031
FORECAST IS TOO OPTIMISTIC SO

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:21.598
THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP OUR

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:25.669
EYES ON. SO WHAT DO WE SEE IS

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:27.471
HAPPENING IN IN THE ECONOMY NOW

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:29.673
WE LOOK AT THIS ON AN AGGREGATE

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.976
BASIS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. N.

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:34.144
S. SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:37.881
THE US IS A 10% DECLINE IN GDP

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:39.883
FROM PEAK TO TROUGH. NOW YOU'LL

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.386
HEAR NUMBERS ABOUT 3035%

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.588
DECLINE IN THE SECOND QUARTER

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:46.690
THOSE ARE ANNUALIZED RATES. BUT

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:47.958
THE ACTUAL DECLINE WILL BE

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:49.827
ABOUT 10% MAYBE A LITTLE

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:53.030
HIGHER. IMPORTANTLYTHE DECLINE

00:43:53.097 --> 00:43:56.433
IN. EMPLOYMENT WILL BE LARGER

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.502
THAN THAT THE ALMOST TWELVE

00:43:58.569 --> 00:44:01.038
PERCENT. IN THE REASON FOR THAT

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:03.040
IS THAT THIS RECESSION IS

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:05.376
SKEWED TOWARDS. THE SERVICE

00:44:05.442 --> 00:44:09.980
SECTOR IN SKEWED TOWARDS LOWER

00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:14.218
SKILLED LOWER WAGE THAT-COMMUNITIES. AND THAT MEANS

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:16.086
THAT EMPLOYMENT THE CLIENTS ARE

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.755
GOING TO BE GREATER THAN GDP

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:23.027
DECLINE IN FOR CALIFORNIA WE'RE

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:24.995
EXPECTING THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:26.830
TO GO UP TO ON A QUARTERLY

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:29.500
AVERAGE BASIS TO GO UP TO ABOUT

00:44:29.566 --> 00:44:31.168
SIXTEEN ANDA HALF PERCENT NOW

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:34.338
CLEARLY IT'S HARD RIGHT NOW BUT

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:35.606
AS THE ECONOMY BEGINS TO OPEN

00:44:35.672 --> 00:44:37.041
UP SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:38.742
CURRENTLY FURLOUGHED WILL BE

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:42.679
HIRED BACK. BUT IMPORTANTLY.

00:44:42.746 --> 00:44:45.149
FIRMS IN RECESSIONS IN THIS IS

00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:46.850
ONE PLACE WHERE WE CAN TAKE THE

00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:48.919
DATA FROM THE PAST FIRMS IN

00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:50.754
RECESSIONS TRY TO MAKE IT TO

00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:51.955
THE OTHER SIDE TO WIN DEMAND

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:54.425
STARTS GROWING TO GET IN SOME

00:44:54.491 --> 00:44:57.227
OF THEM DON'T MAKE IT IN SO OUR

00:44:57.294 --> 00:45:01.598
EXPECTATION IS. THAT THE- AS

00:45:01.665 --> 00:45:03.534
THE RESTRICTIONS ON FIRMS

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.336
OPENING ARTISTE N. FIRMS DO

00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:07.905
OPEN AND HIGHER BACK FOR LET

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:09.640
HIM PLEASE. THE NUMBER THOSE

00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:11.075
FIRMS AND NOT GOING TO MAKE IT

00:45:11.141 --> 00:45:12.142
THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:13.577
BANKRUPTCY AND THEY'RE GONNA

00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:15.612
LAY OFF THOSE EMPLOYEES. AND SO

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:17.548
WE SEE A FURTHER CONTRACTION

00:45:17.614 --> 00:45:19.683
INTO THE THIRD QUARTER OF THIS

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:23.587
YEAR. AND IN THE- UNEMPLOYMENT

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:25.789
RATE WILL PEAK OF SIXTY ABOUT

00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:27.391
SIXTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT. AT

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:28.959
THE END OF THE AT THE END OF

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:30.160
THE YEAR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:31.328
BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT TYPICALLY

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:35.032
KEEPS GOING UP. EVEN AFTER

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:36.433
RECESSION IS OVER WITH. AND

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.801
THEN WE'LL BEGIN RECOVERY AND

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:40.637
THE RECOVERY. THAT WE THINK IS

00:45:40.704 --> 00:45:42.773
GOING TO BE MORE RAPID AND- THE

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.541
IN THE LAST RECESSION JUST

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:46.243
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:46.844
WAY IN WHICH DEMAND HAS BEEN

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:49.313
RESTRICTED. BUT IT'S NOT GOING

00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:51.448
TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY RAPID

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:53.217
RECOVERY THERE TAKE ABOUT

00:45:53.283 --> 00:45:54.852
EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO THE END OF

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:57.588
TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE RETURN

TO TWENTY NINETEEN EMPLOYMENT

00:45:58.388 --> 00:46:00.557

00:46:00.624 --> 00:46:05.429
A AS SOMEONE DIFFICULT. TIME

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:07.097
ZEROING IN. ON WHAT SECTOR ARE

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:08.866

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:12.002
RETAIL WHICH WE DO NOT EXPECT

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:14.505
TO FULLY RECOVER BECAUSE RETAIL

00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:16.874
WAS CONTRACTING. EVEN IN THE

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.675
EXPANDING ECONOMY IN THIS BRICK

00:46:18.742 --> 00:46:20.911

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:28.051
STAB WAS WAS THERE AND- RETAIL

00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:29.520
WORKERS YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND

00:46:29.586 --> 00:46:31.288
REEMPLOYMENT IN THE SAME

INDUSTRY. LEISURE AND

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.158
HOSPITALITY WHICH INCLUDES

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:37.194
TOURISM AND TOURISM IS A SECTOR

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:39.196
THAT IS GOING TO BE HERE FOR

00:46:39.263 --> 00:46:41.064
QUITE A WHILE- BUT OTHER

00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:42.099
ASPECTS OF LEADER OF

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:44.935
HOSPITALITY WE EXPECT TO

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:45.502
RECOVER IN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN

00:46:45.569 --> 00:46:48.272

RAPIDLY IN AND FINALLY

00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.719
CONSTRUCTION. ONE OF THE THINGS

00:47:02.786 --> 00:47:06.089
THAT WE EXPECT AND THEN WE GET

00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:07.858
FROM THE DATA WHAT PASSED FOR

00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:09.393
SESSIONS IS A SAVINGS RATES ARE

00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:11.195
GOING UP. AND THAT MEANS THAT

00:47:11.261 --> 00:47:13.197
CONSUMPTION IS GOING DOWN. THE

HOUSEHOLDS WOOD FRAME REBUILD

00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:17.901
THEIR BALANCE SHEETS AND

00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:19.269
THEY'LL TRY AND SAVE MORE

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.637
BECAUSE THEY ARE UNCERTAIN

00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:22.239
ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:23.907
BUSINESSES WILL DO THE SAME AND

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:27.644
NOT INVEST AS MUCH. IN IN THAT

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:29.846
LEADS TO A SLOWER RECOVERY. THE

00:47:29.913 --> 00:47:31.748
SO IS THERE ANY GOOD NEWS IN

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:36.420
THIS WELL. SOME SORT OF. THE

00:47:36.486 --> 00:47:38.188
GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS WILL BE

00:47:38.255 --> 00:47:39.957
A MORE RAPID RECOVERY THAT WE

WELL. AND THESE TEND TO BE HIGH

00:48:13.423 --> 00:48:15.292
WAGE SECTORS THEY ALSO TEND TO

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:16.593
BE SECTORS THAT.

PEACE BUT AT THE CHAMBER WE

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:11.074
REALLY FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT. AND

00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:12.542
THAT IS THE IMPORTANCE AND THE

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:13.977
SPEED IN WHICH OUR PUBLIC

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:15.612

ABOUT A TWO THREE DAYS A WEEK.

00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:53.817
THAT SHEDS IMPORTANCE ON THE

00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:56.086
OTHER PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:57.287

COME UP WITH LAWS AND

00:51:17.674 --> 00:51:19.609

INSURE THEM. ONE TWO YEAR

00:51:35.325 --> 00:51:37.227
POTENTIALLY AGREE TO SOME NEW

00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:39.095
STANDARDIZATION. ONE IN

BUSINESS SEEMS LIKE RESTAURANTS

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:43.433
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.602
HOW THEY SURVIVE WITH SPREADING

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:47.871
OUT. AND HAVING FEWER SEATS. IN

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:49.573
SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES

00:51:49.639 --> 00:51:51.107
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR

00:51:51.174 --> 00:51:52.642
RESTAURANTS EVEN WITH A FULL

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:55.378
HOUSE TO BREAK EVEN. YOU NEED

00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:41.731
IMPACTS OF THE SHELTER IN PLACE

WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE WHAT

00:56:43.466 --> 00:56:45.135
ARE THE PRIORITIES I THINK

00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:47.303
THERE ARE TWO KEYS TO MOVING

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:48.772
FORWARD IS. RESTORING

00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:50.473
CONFIDENCE AND SUPPORTING

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.776
ECONOMIC GROWTH. FIRST WE MUST

00:56:52.842 --> 00:56:55.712
RESTORE CONFIDENCE. WE ALL WANT

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:57.547
TO RETURN TO WHAT WE DID BEFORE

00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:58.882
WE NEED TO FIND NEW AND SEE

00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:01.584
SAFE WAYS TO DO SO. THE MORE WE

00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:03.820

00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:13.897
WE GET BACK ON TRACK. THIS

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:16.566
ACTIVITY DRIVES DEMAND AND

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:17.834

HINDER ECONOMIC GROWTH IT IS

00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:24.007
IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO NOT

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:27.544

00:59:29.265 --> 00:59:30.500
THAT THEY ARE HAVING A LOT OF

00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:32.969
DIFFICULTY ACCESSING BOTH STATE

UP A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE. OF

00:59:38.675 --> 00:59:39.375
THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IN

00:59:39.442 --> 00:59:41.844

00:59:41.911 --> 00:59:43.980
CONCERN AND WHILE IT'S MUCH

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:45.081
APPRECIATED THAT CALIFORNIA'S

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:46.883
DOING MORE THAN OTHER STATES

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:48.451
RUN DOCUMENTED WORKERS IT

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:49.852
CERTAINLY IS NOT ENOUGH FOR

00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:52.855
PEOPLE FACING A RENT- ISSUES OF

00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:57.193

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.473
CREATES A LACK OF CONSUMPTION

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.376
EVEN AS WE RE OPEN. I IT WILL

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:14.043
BE A SLOW RECOVERY FOR THE

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.446
SERVICE SECTOR- AND LOW WAGE

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:18.181
WORKERS WILL FACE MANY DEATHS.

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:19.983
AND IT WILL BE A SERIOUS

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:21.718
SITUATION WHICH THEY ARE NOT

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:23.386
ABLE TO CONSUME IN THE WAYS.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:24.620

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:34.263
THAT OF OUR THAT STILL HAVE

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:35.865
PEOPLE TO INCLUDE BUSINESSES

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:37.333
AND ALREADY LAID EVERYBODY OFF

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.634
SO THAT THEY CAN GET SOME

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.069
SUBSIDIES AND SUPPORT. TO BRING

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:41.771
PEOPLE BACK ON TO HIRE PEOPLE

01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:44.640
BACK. TO MORE THINGS I'M- I

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:45.941
THINK THIS MOMENT HAS MADE IT

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:48.144
VERY CLEAR WHY UNIVERSAL

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.046
HEALTHCARE IS SO CRITICAL. IT'S

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.914
A BURDEN ON SMALL BUSINESS TO

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:53.549
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.884
TO WORKERS AND IT'S A

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:55.851
TERRIFYING MOMENT RIGHT NOW FOR

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:57.253
LOTS OF WORKERS. THAT ARE

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.587
LOSING THEIR ACCESS TO HEALTH

01:05:58.654 --> 01:05:59.889
CARE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN TIED TO

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:01.590
THEIR LAWYER. UNIVERSAL

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:03.059
HEALTHCARE WOULD REDUCE THE

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:05.461
STATE'S COSTS IT WOULD REDUCE

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:07.263
THE STATE'S BURDEN OF LOTS OF

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:09.131
UNINSURED PEOPLE. TURNING TO

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:10.966
THE PUBLIC SYSTEM. AND NOT

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:12.635
HAVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.303
FURTHERING THE CRISIS EVEN AS

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:15.805
WE COME OUT OF IT. IT WOULD

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:17.540
ALSO SUPPORT UNDOCUMENTED

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:18.808
WORKERS AND WE ALSO NEED TO BE

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:21.677
HEALTHY. IN A MOMENT LIKE THIS

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:22.645
THE UNIVERSE HEALTHCARE WOULD.

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:24.714
ALLOW THE STATE'S ECONOMY TO

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.349
ACTUALLY BE SAVE LOTS OF

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:28.217
HEALTHCARE COSTS AND LASTLY WE

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.019
DO KNOW THE STATE IS GOING TO

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:30.786
LOOK NEED TO LOOK AT INCREASED

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.488
REVENUE. I'M SCHOOLS AND

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:33.889
COMMUNITIES FIRST IS A BALLOT

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:35.358
MEASURE THAT IS ON THE NOVEMBER

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:37.026
BALLOT. THAT WOULD BRING

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:39.195
REVENUE INTO THE STATE IT WOULD

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:40.896
SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND LOCAL

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:43.232
SERVICES. IT WOULD HAVE LARGE

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:44.834
COMPANIES THAT ARE BENEFITING

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.235
FROM THE CRISIS TO PAY THEIR

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:48.537
FAIR SHARE. I'M AND IT WOULD

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:50.606
MOST IMPORTANTLY AS RODNEY

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:51.907
MENTION IS IMPORTANT THING KEEP

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:53.909
OUR SCHOOLS OPEN. SO THEY'RE

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.611
OURS ABOUT THEIR SCHOOLS

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.246
AFFECTING ABOUT TEN THOUSAND

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:58.414
STUDENTS IN ABOUT TWENTY FIVE

01:06:58.481 --> 01:06:59.281
DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:01.083
CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE SLATED TO

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.853
BE CLOSED. NEXT MONTH. I WE

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:05.955
HIGHLY ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:06.822
LOOK AT THAT I KNOW YOU'RE

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.357
HAVING AN EDUCATION. MANY

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.693
HEARING TOMORROW ON IT WOULD BE

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.795
A REALLY BIG MISTAKE TO CLOSE

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.563
SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW WHEN WE KNOW

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:15.931
THAT MORE FISCAL DISTANCING FOR

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:17.366
STUDENTS WILL BE NECESSARY IN

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:18.901
THE FALL. WE NEED TO KEEP

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:21.604
SCHOOLS OPEN. I'M NOT AVOID

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:23.873
PERMANENT CLOSURES. AT THE

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:25.608
MOMENT. AND THEN LASTLY I JUST

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:27.009
WANT TO SAY TO PROTECTIVE

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:30.045
MEASURES ONE. OR WORKERS AS FOR

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:31.814
BOTH ESSENTIAL WORKERS NOW AND

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.682
FOR WORKERS COMING BACK. WE

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:36.752
MUST HAVE PP WE MUST HAVE

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:38.687
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WE MUST

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:41.056
HAVE EXPANDED PAID LEAVE. AND

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:42.892
WORKERS NEED A VOICE ON THE JOB

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.126
WITH REGARD TO HEALTH AND

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:45.694
SAFETY IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:47.730
THAT WORK PLACES ARE SAFE. WE

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:49.064
NEED TO MAKE SURE THA EVERY

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:51.267
WORKPLACE HAS A HEALTH AND

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:52.435
SAFETY COMMITTEE IN WHICH

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:55.938
WORKERS ARE ALL TO SEE. ABOUT

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:56.539
IS THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.040
AND THAT OUR BUSINESS REOPEN

01:07:58.107 --> 01:07:59.608
WORKERS ARE SAFE AND THE AND

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:01.477
CONSUMERS ARE SAFE AS WELL. AND

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:03.012
LASTLY WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC

01:08:03.078 --> 01:08:05.181
SECTOR JOBS. WE DID NOT

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:06.715
ACTUALLY RECOVER THE NUMBER OF

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:09.819
PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS FROM THE

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:10.619
TWENTY EIGHTEEN RECESSION WE'RE

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.354
STILL A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:14.256
THOUSAND DOLLARS JOB AS OUR

01:08:14.323 --> 01:08:14.824
HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND JOBS

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.292
BELOW PRE RECESSION LEVELS IF

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:17.827
YOU TAKE. APPELLATION GROWTH

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.995
INTO ACCOUNT. UP CUTTING PUBLIC

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:21.530
SERVICES DURING THIS RECESSION

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:22.832
WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THOSE

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.733
MOST IN NEED AND CREATE A DRAG

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.368
ON THE ECONOMY SO WE NEED TO

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:27.703
MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT CUTTING

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.738
PUBLIC IN POINT EMPLOYMENT. ON

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:30.840
THE CONTRARY WE SHOULD BE

01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:32.942
LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN HIRE LOTS

01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:34.376
OF WORKERS IN PUBLIC SECTOR

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:36.111
JOBS TO BE DOING CONTACT

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:37.046
TRACING. WE CAN LOOK AT

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:38.447
INFRASTRUCTURE AND A NUMBER OF

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:40.549
OTHER THINGS. AND SO THESE ARE

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:41.650
SOME OF THE KEY IDEAS WOULD

01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:42.852
LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU LIKE

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:44.153
THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO SUPPORT

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.855
HIGH ROAD BUSINESSES. AND

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.323
WORKERS AT THE SAME TIME

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:49.291
SUPPORT COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:51.293
RING REVENUE INTO THE STATE AND

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.661
SURE EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:54.530
HEALTHCARE SO THAT WE DON'T.

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:59.235
FURTHER BURDENS STATE HEALTH.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.736
THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY MUCH

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.838
APPRECIATE IT. NEXT WE'RE GONNA

01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:05.374
HAVE OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:08.978
MR PANIC SPEAK. OKAY HELLO

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:10.946
MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:13.415
THE INVITATION TO BE HERE TODAY.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:16.118
I GET CREDIT QUICKLY OF ALICE I

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.887
WOULD- BEGIN JUST BY HAVE GOING

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.389
BACK- LOOK ON SOMETHING

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:21.790
PROFESSOR NICHOLS BURKE SAID

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:24.226
THAT CLEARLY IS THE ECONOMY HAS

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:26.595
ENTERED INTO A RECESSION. AND

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.598
IT APPEARS TO BE THE EARLY

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.600
SEVERE WANTED THAT. OUR OFFICE

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.236
IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING IT'S

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:36.238
THIS CALL ESTIMATES. WERE THEY

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:38.607
COMING BUDGET YEAR AND THE- THE

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.509
CURRENT ONE. AND WE DON'T HAVE

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.778
PRECISE ESTIMATES TO DISCUSS

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.281
TODAY BUT I THINK I CAN MAKE

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:47.683
THREE OBSERVATIONS WITH SOME

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.318
CONFIDENCE AT THIS POINT. THE

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:51.453
FIRST IS THAT THE STATE IS

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.556
PRETTY CLEARLY GONE FROM

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:57.359
ANTICIPATED- SURPLUS IN NOW

01:09:57.426 --> 01:09:58.727
EIGHTEEN BUDGET PROBLEM BY

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:00.296
WHICH I MEAN. THE STATE'S

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:02.231
REVENUES ARE LIKELY TO BE

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:04.066
INSUFFICIENT TO COVER TO

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:05.634
EXISTING COMMITMENTS. THE

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:09.271
SECOND POINT IS THAT THE-

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:11.140
BUDGET PROBLEM AS IT USUALLY

01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:12.942
DOES WHEN THERE'S A RECESSION

01:10:13.008 --> 01:10:15.244
WILL LIKELY SPANNED MORE THAN

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:17.713
ONE BUDGET CYCLE. AND THEN

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.515
THIRD GIVEN THE DIS THE

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:21.016
SEVERITY OF THE DOWNTURN

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:23.385
THERE'S BEEN DESCRIBED. IT'S

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:25.220
LIKELY THAT THE BUDGET PROBLEM

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:29.191
ITSELF IN TOTAL WILL EXCEED THE

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:29.725
STATE'S ACCUMULATED BUDGET

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:33.062
RESEARCH. AND HAS THE CHAIR

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:33.862
MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING

01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:35.798
REMARKS. THIS STATE IS

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:37.600
CONSTRAINED BY ITS BALANCE BUT

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:39.201
REQUIREMENTS. THEREIS

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:40.936
GENERALLY MEANS THAT AN

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:42.137
INCREASE IN SPENDING IN ONE

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:44.807
AREA MUST BE OFFSET BY REDUCED

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:47.076
SPENDING IN ANOTHER AREA WHERE

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.110
BY BRINGING IN ADDITIONAL

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:50.713
REVENUES IN THE FORM OF HIGHER

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:54.183
TAXES. IS THE USUAL WAY.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.884
NEVERTHELESS GIVEN THE ECONOMIC

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:57.920
CRISIS THEY WERE FACING THERE'S

01:10:57.987 --> 01:11:01.323
A REAL. AND PUTTING DOLLARS

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:04.793
INTO THE ECONOMY- ISSUING BONDS

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.595
FOR EXAMPLE IS SOMETIMES

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:08.263
THOUGHT OF THIS AS ONE OF THE

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:10.532
WAY TO DO THIS BY ACCELERATING

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:12.301
THE PLANNED BOND ISSUANCE

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:15.170
SCHEDULE AND- FINANCING CAPITAL

01:11:15.237 --> 01:11:18.674
PROJECTS WITH THE BOND PROCEEDS.

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:20.309
THAT COULD BE BACK TO ONE IDEA

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:22.177
THAT IS SOMETIMES MENTIONED AS

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:23.846
A WAY TO BRING AND STIMULUS

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.180
HOWEVER I THINK THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:26.548
MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT DOING

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:29.351
THAT. BRINGS WITH IT HI YOUR

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.654
COSTS DOWN THE ROAD TO SERVICE

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:34.390
THE DEBT. IN ADDITION WHEN THE

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:37.159
NEED IS REALLY TO BRING FUNDS

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:38.761
INTO THE ECONOMY QUICKLY.

01:11:38.827 --> 01:11:40.629
THERE'S A TIME PROBLEM BECAUSE

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:43.065
THE BOND. LANDING THE LARGE

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.733
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN A

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.735
RANGE YOU NEED IN THE FINANCING

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.904
X. TIME IT MAY NOT BE

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:49.438
APPROPRIATE FOR THE MOMENT

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:51.707
WE'RE IN. SO IN GENERAL THERE

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.409
ARE TWO WAYS THAT THE STATE CAN

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.811
SPEND MORE. THAN ITS CURRENT

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:57.446
REVENUE BASE WILL ALLOW WITHOUT

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:59.148
MAKING ACCENTING REDUCTIONS IN

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:02.217
OTHER AREAS WERE BY INCREASING

01:12:02.284 --> 01:12:05.054
TAX REVENUE. AND THE FIRST IS

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.855
TO BORROW INTERNALLY BASICALLY

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.457
SPEND SOME OF THE BALLOTS IS

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:09.758
HELD IN THE STATE'S SPECIAL

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:12.961
FUNDS. AND THE OTHER IS JUST TO

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:14.430
SPEND DOWN IT'S MAKING RATED

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:17.366
BUDGET RESERVE. BUT WHEN YOU

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:19.268
PUT IT ALL TOGETHER I MEAN THE

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:21.603
STATE'S OPTIONS WERE PROVIDING

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:23.972
ECONOMIC STIMULUS ARE REALLY

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:26.775
VERY LIMITED DANCE COMPARED.

A MAXIMUM OF TWENTY SIX WEEKS.

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:32.641
THE WAY THAT THESE BENEFITS ARE

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.309
PAID FOR THROUGH AN EMPLOYER OR

CONTINUE TO BE PAID BECAUSE IN

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.336
THE IN AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:02.638
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AUTOMATIC

01:14:02.704 --> 01:14:04.706

CONTINUE TO PAY. THE BENEFITS

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:18.921
EVEN THOUGH THE FUND ITSELF IS

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:21.523
GONZALEZ. IN IT IT IS THIS

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.725
ARRANGEMENT PRECISELY THAT

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:25.861
WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:28.897
STATE TO INCREASE ITS ITS OWN

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.766

BORROWED FUNDS BECAUSE- AN

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:38.774
INCREASE THE REGARDLESS OF

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.909
WHETHER THE STATE INCREASES IN.

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:43.178
THE FUND IS LIKELY TO GO INTO

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:44.446
AND SOLVE IT THE DECISION GIVEN

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:48.116
THE SEVERITY OF THIS DOWNTURN.

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:49.685
WHAT DO WE THIS KIND OF IN MY

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:52.020
TO THE PRO OF COURSE WOULD QUIT

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:55.090
FIND FURTHER INTO INSOLVENCY.

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:57.092
BUT YOU KNOW AS I AM SAYING

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:59.094
THAT THE BENEFITS COULD STILL

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.729
BE PAID THROUGH THE- FEDERAL

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:03.131
LOAN. NOW THE STATE COULD

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:05.234
DESIGN THE INCREASES IN A

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.435
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS YOU

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:08.570
CAN HI U. FORMULA BASED ON

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:10.305
EMPLOYEES AND THE WAGES THAT

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:13.308
THE EMPLOYEE WAS EARNING BEFORE

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:14.877
THEY LOST THEIR JOB. WORKING

01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:17.546
PROVIDING ACROSS THE BOARD

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:19.982
AMEN- INSTILL OR TO THE FEDERAL

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:22.618
CARES ACT RECENTLY THE FEDERAL

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:24.152
CARES ACT INCLUDED TWO HUNDRED

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:26.421
AND SIXTY BILLION IN FUNDING TO

PROVIDE A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:29.691
PER WEEK INCREASE TO THE

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:32.728
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WERE THE

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:35.163
ONLY PEOPLE THIS YEAR IS NO

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:40.002
ALSO EXTENDED THE PERIOD. OF

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:40.602
KNOWLEDGE ABILITY BY THIRTEEN

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.604
WEEKS. NOW THERE'S THE QUESTION

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:45.874
OF HOW TO REPAY THIS LOAN IN

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:48.644
THE NORMAL COURSE YEAH YOU KNOW

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:50.412
WHEN THE FUN GOES IN SOLVING.

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.247
THESE LOANS WHEN THEY'RE DRAWN

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:57.085
UPON GET REPAID BY FUTURE TAX

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:58.587
COLLECTIONS ON THE EMPLOYERS.

01:15:58.654 --> 01:16:01.290
IN THE PAST- WHEN THE IT IT

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:02.357
THIS IS OCCURRED WHEN THE

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:04.259
ECONOMY IS STRENGTHENED AND

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:05.661
THEN USUALLY THE STATE GENERAL

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:07.562
FUND HAS PAID THE INTEREST COST

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:09.965
ON THOSE LONG. BUT GIVEN THE

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:11.667
EXACT IN ITS NATURE OF THIS

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:15.270
ECONOMIC SHOCK. AND THE BUT

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.272
BECAUSE OF THE DOWNTURN IS AS

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:18.640
PROFESSOR NICHOLS BURKE SAID

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:20.142
WE'RE SORT OF IN A PAN DOOM AND

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:23.679
DEREK INDUCED RECESSION.

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:25.380
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

01:16:25.447 --> 01:16:27.382
RETAIN SEARCH LOANS STRAIGHT

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:29.284
FROM THE GENERAL FUND WITHOUT

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:31.186
SHIFTING THE BURDEN BACK TO THE

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.221
EMPLOYERS DOWN THE ROAD. OUR

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:35.123
OFFICE IS ALSO WRITTEN UP SOME

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:37.025
EXAMPLE OF THE OTHER IDEAS

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:38.627
STUDY THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:40.829
COULD CONSIDER. THESE WOULD

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:42.764
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE EXPANDING

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:43.966
THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:45.267
PROGRAM TWO CATEGORIES OF

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:46.735
WORKERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:49.004
INELIGIBLE. FOR EXPANDING THE

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:53.408
STATE. PROGRAM YOU- WORKERS

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:54.776
THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:56.878
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. I'LL

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.680
SPEND LESSTIME ON THOSE IS

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:01.283
BECAUSE THOSE IDEAS WOULD NOT

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:05.454
BE. ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.555
LOAN SUPPORT THAT I MENTIONED

01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:08.256
IN THE REGIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:10.792
INSURANCE PROGRAM. AND AS SUCH

01:17:10.859 --> 01:17:12.294
THEY WOULD REQUIRE THE USE OF

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:15.030
STATE RESOURCES WHICH BRINGS

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:16.231
BUT RANGERS BACK ABOUT A

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.733
REGIONAL TRADE OFF THAT I

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:19.001
MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:21.069
BECAUSE OF THE STATE'S BALANCED

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:24.406
BUDGET REQUIRE. SO WITH THAT-

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:26.074
BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS WHEN

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:29.811

MY REMARKS TODAY WILL FOCUS ON

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:49.364
THE STATE'S OPTIONS FOR OUR

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:50.532
RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:52.434
IMPLICATIONS OF THE CRISIS BUT

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:55.270
PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE WORKERS

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:58.106
AFFECTED BY ISIS AND I WANT TO

01:17:58.173 --> 01:18:00.075
START BY STRESSING. AS HAS BEEN

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:01.843
SAID HERE TODAY JUST HOW

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.412
DIFFERENT THIS RECESSION IS

ALREADY FROM THE FIRE EVEN IF

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.015
THERE WILL BE A TENDENCY TO

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:09.051
COMPARE IT IN TERMS OF SCALE IN

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.252
SIZE TO THE DEPTHS OF THE GREAT

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:11.820
RECESSION. WE HAVE AN

QUICKLY IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:20.595
AT LEAST NOT IN OUR

01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:22.531
CONTEMPORARY HISTORY AND A

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:24.199

THAT YOU MAKE IN THE WEEKS AND

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:30.785
ALSO CLEAR THAT THE ECONOMIC

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:32.187
IMPLICATIONS OF CRISIS WILL

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:33.922

JUMPSTART AND THE ECONOMY AND

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:02.210
GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AS

AND IT'S DOWN IN THE WAY IT IS.

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:09.283
IMPORTANT SO. NOW I AND WAIT ON

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.884
THE SHIPS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:12.153
THING RIGHT NOW. AND FOR MISTER

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.222
NICHOLS BERG- HOW LONG WILL

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:16.224
SMALL BUSINESS BE ABLE SURVIVE

01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:22.664
WITH A SHELTER IN PLACE. HOW

01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:23.831
LONG WILL SMALL BUSINESS BE

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:24.899
ABLE TO SURVIVE WITH THE

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:27.068
STRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT'S AND

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:27.902
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION IN

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:30.972
ANY. RECESSION WE FIND THAT

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:32.774
BUSINESSES THAT WERE GOING INTO

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.043
THE RECESSION WITH THAT VERY

01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:36.444
LOW MARGINS HAVE A HARD TIME

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:39.447
MAKING IT THROUGH. THE IN THIS

01:28:39.514 --> 01:28:41.749
CASE IT DEPENDS ON. WELL REALLY

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:44.419
ON WHAT SECTOR THERE IN. AND

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:47.255
THAT HOW CONSUMERS COME BACK SO

01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:50.124
FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE RETAIL

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:52.160
SECTOR THERE WILL BE MANY

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:54.495
RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS- SMALL

01:28:54.562 --> 01:28:57.699
AND MEDIUM AND EVEN LARGE

01:28:57.765 --> 01:29:00.802
RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS. THAT ARE

01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:03.104
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO. COME

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.073
BACK THEY WILL TRY TO OPEN UP

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:06.808
AND THEN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:09.143
PAST SAYS THAT THEY WILL. END

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:13.147
UP IN BANKRUPTCY AND IN CLOSING

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:14.515
SO IN THE RETAIL SECTOR WE

01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:18.052
EXPECT A PERMANENT SHRINKAGE.

01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:20.288
IN LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY IT

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:22.590
DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:25.727
FIRM IS SERVING. EARLY TOURISTS

01:29:25.793 --> 01:29:28.996
OR PRIMARILY A LOCAL RESIDENTS

01:29:29.063 --> 01:29:32.767
AND IN THE- ARENA OF TOURISM WE

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:35.937
EXPECT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:37.371
TO BE NEEDED FOR A VERY LONG

01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:41.109
TIME WAY PAST THAT TWENTY

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:41.876
TWENTY TWO DOMESTIC TERRORISM

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:44.245
SHOULD START PICKING UP PEOPLE

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:46.280
ARE ANXIOUS TO GET OUT. NOT

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:48.716
THAT IT AGAIN THAT'S NOT A FULL

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:51.285
RECOVERY IN THE TOURIST SECTOR

01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:52.854
SO THOSE ARE THE WEAKEST

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.756
SECTORS IN IMPORTANT TO KNOW

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.290
THAT THOSE ARE SECTORS THAT

01:29:56.357 --> 01:29:59.627
EMPLOYEE- REALLY AREN'T ON

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:00.995
AVERAGE LOWER INCOME

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:03.131
CALIFORNIANS THAN OTHER SECTORS

01:30:03.197 --> 01:30:04.665
AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO HIT ON

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:06.901
THAT IS THERE ANY MODELING THIS

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:10.571
BEEN DONE. REGARDING THAT. SO

01:30:10.638 --> 01:30:14.275
THAT IN MODELING AS TO THE-

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:16.978
LONGEVITY OF SMALL BUSINESS IN

01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:19.814
THESE SECTORS CORRECT. AND NOT

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:21.649
EXPLICIT MODELING BUT THE DATA

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:23.651
THAT WE OBSERVE ON THE

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.486
EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT IN

01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:26.954
THESE SECTORS FROM PAST

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:29.123
RECESSIONS ARE INDICATIVE OF

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:30.992
WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:34.028
THIS. RECESSION AND RECOVERY

01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:35.263
STILL IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH

01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:36.898
QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WE EXPECT

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:39.500
BUSINESS FAILURES AS A DIRECT

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:40.535
RESULT OF THE RECESSION WHICH

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:43.538

MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS

01:31:53.374 --> 01:31:56.143
QUESTION THERE IS A DESIRE TO

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:57.678
START AS WE START LOOKING AT RE

01:31:57.745 --> 01:31:59.981
OPENING- TO CHANGE THE WAY

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:01.616
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES

01:32:01.682 --> 01:32:03.117
VERSES ESSENTIAL VERSES

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:06.053
NONESSENTIAL TO SAFE VERSES

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:09.190
MAYBE NOT SO SAFE- AND IS THE

01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:10.424
IS THE ADMINISTRATION

01:32:10.491 --> 01:32:11.726
ANTICIPATING ANY SORT OF A

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:13.160
CHANGE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A

01:32:13.227 --> 01:32:15.029
SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. YOU

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:16.497
PROBABLY CONSIDER YOUR BUSINESS

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:18.065
ESSENTIAL IT'S ESSENTIAL TO

01:32:18.132 --> 01:32:19.367
YOUR FAMILY IT'S ESSENTIAL TO

01:32:19.433 --> 01:32:22.103
THE PEOPLE YOU EMPLOY AND- IT'S

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:23.537
ESSENTIAL TO YOUR COMMUNITY IN

01:32:23.604 --> 01:32:26.374
MANY WAYS AND SO THAT WHILE WE

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.109
WERE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

01:32:28.175 --> 01:32:30.077
THIS AND RAMPING UP- AND

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:32.179
LOOKING AT THE SURGE- THAT

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:34.048
TERMINOLOGY MAY HAVE BEEN MORE

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:35.116
APPROPRIATE BUT AS WE MOVE

01:32:35.182 --> 01:32:37.051
FORWARD I HAVE TO FEEL LIKE

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:37.919
THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESS

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:41.188
OWNERS THAT COULD BE OPERATING-

01:32:41.255 --> 01:32:43.224
SAFELY. GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:44.392
TO DO SO I THINK LIKE AN

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.327
ACCOUNTING FOR EXAMPLE MAY HAVE

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:47.795
A SMALL COUNTY FUHRMAN HAS ITS

01:32:47.862 --> 01:32:48.729
OWN PRIVATE OFFICE REACH

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:51.065
EMPLOYEE OR AN ATTORNEY'S FIRM

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:53.367
THAT HAS THE SAME SORT OF- SAME

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:55.336
SORT OF- ARRANGEMENT OUT THERE.

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:58.372
SO IS THERE ANY ANTICIPATION OF

01:32:58.439 --> 01:33:00.141
THE SORT OF A CHANGE IN THE WAY

01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:02.877
WE LOOK AT BUSINESSES- AND SORT

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:04.679
OF THE JARGON THAT WERE USING

01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:07.615
DESCRIBE WHETHER A BIT YOU KNOW

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:08.215
WHETHER BUSINESS COULD BE OPEN

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:12.286
OR NOT. WELL THANK YOU FOR.

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:13.587
THAT QUESTION THIS IS MARCO

01:33:13.654 --> 01:33:14.455
WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:33:14.522 --> 01:33:17.058
SERVICES AGENCY. I HAVE I THINK

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:18.693
THAT- YOU'RE CORRECT IN THE

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:20.461
SENSE THAT YOU KNOW AND WE LOOK

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:21.762
AT THE SIX INDICATORS THAT THE

01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:23.664
GOVERNOR HAS LAID OUT. WHAT WE

01:33:23.731 --> 01:33:25.566
ARE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON

01:33:25.633 --> 01:33:27.001
IS FIGURE OUT WAYS IN WHICH

01:33:27.068 --> 01:33:28.936
BUSINESS SAYS AMONGST VARIOUS

01:33:29.003 --> 01:33:30.805
SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY. AND

01:33:30.871 --> 01:33:33.941
SAFELY OPEN UP- BASED ON-

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:35.309
PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE AND

01:33:35.376 --> 01:33:36.410

SURE THAT WE PROVIDE. A CLEAR

01:33:40.881 --> 01:33:42.717
CONCISE AND TIMELY GUIDANCE IS

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:43.951
GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:33:44.018 --> 01:33:45.953
AND SO WE ARE ENGAGING. WITH

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:46.821
THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

01:33:46.887 --> 01:33:48.723
OFFICERS FALLS IN RURAL AND

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:50.558

UNDERSTAND KIND OF. WHAT THEY

01:36:25.746 --> 01:36:27.915
PERSPECTIVE OF OUR SAFETY NET

01:36:27.982 --> 01:36:29.650

GET PP. WE HAVEN'T ACCOMPLISHED

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:20.514

THOSE BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:23.350
TO SUFFER UNEMPLOYMENT WILL

01:40:23.417 --> 01:40:25.853
CONTINUE TO GO UP AND THE

01:40:25.919 --> 01:40:27.354
ECONOMY WILL CONTINUE TO TURN

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:29.156
DOWN AND SO I GUESS WHAT I WAS

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:31.225
HOPING FOR OUT OF THAT WAS THAT

01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:35.095
THERE IS A PLAN TO HELP WE ARE.

01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:37.364
THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY AND

01:40:37.431 --> 01:40:39.733
IN THE WORLD. COULD WE NOT

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.468
FIGURE OUT A PLAN MAYBE TO

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:42.870
ACTUALLY BEGIN TO PRODUCE OUR

01:40:42.936 --> 01:40:46.473
OWN PP THESE MASKS. AND ALL

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.674
THESE OTHER THINGS ARE GOING TO

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:49.643
BE A WAY OF LIFE FOR MONTHS AND

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:52.346
MAYBE LONGER- AND I WOULD

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:55.849
REALLY ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO

01:40:55.916 --> 01:40:58.218
AT SHORING UP THINGS BECAUSE

01:40:58.285 --> 01:41:00.487
SHORING UP DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR

01:41:00.554 --> 01:41:02.856
THE HUGE INCREASE. IN THE

01:41:02.923 --> 01:41:04.691
DEMAND IN THE NEED FOR THESE

01:41:04.758 --> 01:41:06.226
SUPPLIES YOU CAN SHORE UP THE

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:07.995
SUPPLY CHAIN. BUT THAT SUPPLY

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:09.630
CHAIN IS GROSSLY INADEQUATE

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:11.064
RIGHT NOW AND IT'S GOING TO BE

01:41:11.131 --> 01:41:12.266
GROSSLY INADEQUATE FOR A LONG

01:41:12.332 --> 01:41:14.501
TIME. SO MY HOPE IS THAT YOU

01:41:14.568 --> 01:41:15.836
KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:17.604
CONCERTED EFFORT BECAUSE I JUST

01:41:17.671 --> 01:41:18.639
THINK OF PEOPLE WHO GAVE AWAY

01:41:18.705 --> 01:41:20.307
THEIR PP AND THE SPIRIT OF

01:41:20.374 --> 01:41:22.476
WANTING TO HELP. NOW THEY'RE

01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:23.444
GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO REOPEN

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:24.945
THEIR BUSINESS AND THEY WILL BE

01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:26.980
ABLE TO GET PP. AND THAT'S

01:41:27.047 --> 01:41:29.149
GOING TO BE ANOTHER I CONSIDER

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:30.918
THIS A CRISIS QUITE FRANKLY ON

01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:35.088
TOP OF A CRISIS SO. THANK YOU.

01:41:41.495 --> 01:41:43.664
FOR MR PADDOCK YOU HAD US IN

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:45.732
TESTIMONY ABOUT CREATIVE USES

01:41:45.799 --> 01:41:46.733
OF THE TITLE TWELVE LOAN

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:49.236
PROCESS TO BORROW MONEY- FORM

01:41:49.303 --> 01:41:50.804
THE FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT SYSTEM

01:41:50.871 --> 01:41:53.140
AND- I WAS WONDERING IF YOU

01:41:53.207 --> 01:41:54.741
COULD COMMENT ON- THE

01:41:54.808 --> 01:41:56.043
EXPERIENCE OF OTHER STATES

01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:58.879
WHICH HAS BEEN THAT THIS NEW-

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:00.814
FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.

01:42:00.881 --> 01:42:02.149
BENEFIT OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:04.618
A WEEK- OTHER STATES THAT ARE A

01:42:04.685 --> 01:42:05.686
LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF CALIFORNIA

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.187
AND RE OPENING THEIR ECONOMIES

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:09.790
HAVE FOUND THAT IN CERTAIN-

01:42:09.857 --> 01:42:11.792
WORK FOR SECTORS IT'S BEEN

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:13.126
DIFFICULT TO HIRE BACK

01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:14.928
EMPLOYEES WHERE THE COMBINATION

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:17.030
OF- STATE AND FEDERAL

01:42:17.097 --> 01:42:18.765
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. CREATES

01:42:18.832 --> 01:42:20.634
AN ECONOMIC INCENTIVE FOR

01:42:20.701 --> 01:42:21.568
WORKERS NOT TO COME BACK TO

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:22.436
WORK AND SO THEY'VE HAD

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:24.705
PROBLEMS A PARTICULARLY IN THE

01:42:24.771 --> 01:42:26.406
HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY RE OPENING

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:27.174
THOSE SECTIONS OF THE ECONOMY

01:42:27.241 --> 01:42:30.177
SO- MISTER PATRICK DO YOU FEAR

01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:32.679
THAT SHOULDN'T WE- IMPLEMENT A

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:37.484
PROGRAM LIKE THE ONE THAT YOUR-

01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:37.985
THOSE PROBLEMS WOULD BE

01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:40.654
EXPERIENCED HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:42.589
YES THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE

01:42:42.656 --> 01:42:43.123
I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD

01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:45.792
QUESTION. AND I THINK IT IS I

01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:48.962
THINK IN GENERALTHE IDEA THAT

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:51.632
I. MENTIONED WAS BORN OUT OF

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:53.567
BUT SOME BRAINSTORMING AND WE

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:55.035
WERE DOING IN OUR OFFICE ABOUT

01:42:55.102 --> 01:42:57.571
WE USE. THAT THE STATE COULD

01:42:57.638 --> 01:42:59.506
GIVE IN ITS- OVER ARCHING

01:42:59.573 --> 01:43:00.874
BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND THE

01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:03.010
ISSUES THAT I MENTIONED WE WERE

01:43:03.076 --> 01:43:04.344
TRYING TO DO SOME BRAINSTORMING

01:43:04.411 --> 01:43:07.447
ABOUT WAYS THE STATE COULD. YOU

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:09.349
KNOW HELP GET FUNDS INTO THE

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:12.953
ECONOMY. SO IT IS ONE WAY TO DO

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:15.222
THAT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:16.823
THERE'S A VERY. MATERIAL

01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:18.792
TRADEOFFS BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:21.194
INTO ACCOUNT INCLUDING THE FACT

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:23.196
THAT IT ALONE WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:43:23.263 --> 01:43:25.098
REPAID ALTHOUGH I WOULD MENTION

01:43:25.165 --> 01:43:27.501
THAT THAT THERE IS ACT- MADE

01:43:27.568 --> 01:43:29.436
THE BILL FEDERAL LOAN INTEREST

01:43:29.503 --> 01:43:30.470
FREE AT LEAST FOR THE REMAINDER

01:43:30.537 --> 01:43:32.706
OF. TWENTY TWENTY BUT THEN

01:43:32.773 --> 01:43:34.541
THERE ARE ALSO THESE ARE

01:43:34.608 --> 01:43:37.711
ECONOMIC- INSTEAD OF. I OF

01:43:37.778 --> 01:43:39.179
QUESTION THAT YOU'RE- AND I

01:43:39.246 --> 01:43:40.480
THINK THAT THE ANY GOT

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:41.782
SOMETHING THAT WOULD PROBABLY

01:43:41.848 --> 01:43:44.384
WARRANT FURTHER DISCUSSION

01:43:44.451 --> 01:43:46.286
PERHAPS WITH INCLUDED EXPERTS

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:48.422
LIKE. PROFESSOR NIKOLSBURG OR

01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:50.490
OTHER ECONOMIST BECAUSE I THINK

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:52.125
IT'S A VALID QUESTION AND

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:55.195
SOMETHING THAT. THAT YOU KNOW

01:43:55.262 --> 01:43:59.967
THE- YOU WOULD WANT TO WAIT

01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:00.867
BEFORE BEFORE PROCEEDING. I

01:44:00.934 --> 01:44:02.736
THANK YOU AND TO FOLLOW ON TO

01:44:02.803 --> 01:44:03.804
THAT QUESTION FOR THE

01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:06.239
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHEN MR

01:44:06.306 --> 01:44:08.875
PEDICLE WAS- SPEAKING ABOUT THE

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.677
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:12.179
HE MENTIONED A CONCERN ABOUT

01:44:12.245 --> 01:44:15.082
HOW THOSE LOANS GET REPAID. AND

01:44:15.148 --> 01:44:16.917
I WONDERED IF THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:19.353
FINANCE HAD- SOME- SOME

01:44:19.419 --> 01:44:20.420
INFORMATION FOR US ON THE

01:44:20.487 --> 01:44:22.155
ADMINISTRATION'S THOUGHTS ABOUT

01:44:22.222 --> 01:44:23.123
HOW THOSE LOANS WOULD GET

01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:24.925
REPAID BECAUSE AS MR PADDOCK

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:27.995
TESTIFIED IF WE DO NOTHING THAT

01:44:28.061 --> 01:44:28.962
ENTIRE BURDEN IS GOING TO FALL

01:44:29.029 --> 01:44:30.764
ON THE BACKS OF EMPLOYERS IN

01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:32.432
CALIFORNIA WHICH- WOULD BE A

01:44:32.499 --> 01:44:33.867
GROSS INJUSTICE AND STAY REALLY

01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:35.035
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:37.170
CRISIS. AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T

01:44:37.237 --> 01:44:39.339
WANT TO LAY OFF THOSE EMPLOYEES

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:45.579
OR MAKE THEM UNEMPLOYED. YES

01:44:45.646 --> 01:44:46.980
MISTER OBERNOLTE THIS IS TO

01:44:47.047 --> 01:44:47.581
MAKE THIS NOT THAT FROM THE

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:50.250
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I THINK-

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:52.119
IN THE LAST RECESSION YOU ARE

01:44:52.185 --> 01:44:54.588
CORRECT THAT- AS MR PROTOCOL SO

01:44:54.655 --> 01:44:56.757
SAD. THE GENERAL FUND PAID THE

01:44:56.823 --> 01:44:58.592
INTEREST ON THE LOAN WHILE THE

01:44:58.659 --> 01:44:59.960
PRINCIPLE OF THE LOAN WAS PAID

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:01.795
BACK THROUGH EMPLOYERS VIA

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:04.398
FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT. TAXES I

01:45:04.464 --> 01:45:05.365
THINK THE WAY THAT WE'RE

01:45:05.432 --> 01:45:07.334
LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT NOW- YOU

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:08.835
KNOW AS OF APRIL SIXTEENTH WE

01:45:08.902 --> 01:45:10.003
STILL HAD ONE POINT NINE

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:11.672
BILLION DOLLARS- IN OUR TRUST

01:45:11.738 --> 01:45:13.340
FUND BUT WE IMAGINE THAT THAT

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:14.675
WILL BE DRAWN DOWN IN PRETTY

01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:16.076
SHORT ORDER WE- RECEIVED.

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:18.412
AUTHORIZATION TO BORROW- AND WE

01:45:18.478 --> 01:45:19.646
WILL LIKELY YOU KNOW BE DOING

01:45:19.713 --> 01:45:20.681
BORROWING IN THE BILLIONS OF

01:45:20.747 --> 01:45:22.115
DOLLARS FOR THE RAIN REMAINDER

01:45:22.182 --> 01:45:24.451
UP THIS YEAR- IT DEPENDING ON

01:45:24.518 --> 01:45:26.753
HOW THAT SITUATION INVOLVES. I

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.321
THINK IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION

01:45:28.388 --> 01:45:30.757
TO ANSWER RIGHT NOW BECAUSE- AS

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:32.092
YOU NOTED THIS WILL BE AN

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.660
ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:35.295
JUST AS IT WAS DURING THE GREAT

01:45:35.362 --> 01:45:37.330
RECESSION. AT THE SAME TIME-

01:45:37.397 --> 01:45:38.799
THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE UNDER

01:45:38.865 --> 01:45:40.767
VERY SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE AND

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:41.635
YOU'RE RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT

01:45:41.702 --> 01:45:43.170
FINANCES DOING. OUR FINAL

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:44.237
FORECASTING FOR THE NAY

01:45:44.304 --> 01:45:46.673
REVISION- BUT WE KNOW THAT WE

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:47.941
AS WELL AS ALL OF YOU WANT TO

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:49.309
MAKE VERY DIFFICULT AND EVEN

01:45:49.376 --> 01:45:51.211
PAINFUL DECISIONS. ABOUT HOW

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:52.079
THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE

01:45:52.145 --> 01:45:54.247
ALLOCATED NOT ONLY THIS YEAR

01:45:54.314 --> 01:45:55.148
BUT IN SEVERAL YEARS AFTER

01:45:55.215 --> 01:45:57.217
THAT. SO THERE IS A TRADE OFF

01:45:57.284 --> 01:45:58.518
AND THAT IF THE GENERAL FUND

01:45:58.585 --> 01:46:00.487
PICKS UP SOME OF THE PRINCIPLE

01:46:00.554 --> 01:46:02.389
IN ADDITION TO THE INTEREST-

01:46:02.456 --> 01:46:03.690
THAT WILL BE MONEY THAT'S NOT

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:06.393
AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PROGRAMS-

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:07.427
INCLUDING UNDERSECRETARY. OUR

01:46:07.494 --> 01:46:08.829
MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

01:46:08.895 --> 01:46:10.097
WHICH I KNOW IT'S BEEN A THEME

01:46:10.163 --> 01:46:11.765
OF SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS

01:46:11.832 --> 01:46:13.033
SO THERE'S NO REALLY. GOOD OR

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.135
EASY ANSWER HERE AT ALL STATE

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:16.036
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION WE'RE

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:17.270
LOOKING AT THE SITUATION RIGHT

01:46:17.337 --> 01:46:19.706
NOW. I'M AS PART OF OUR

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:22.809
DELIBERATIONS I JUST MAY NOT. A

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:25.979
NAY CLASS AND OF THAT. BUDGET

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:26.947
THIS YEAR BUT WE HAVEN'T BAR

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:30.016
YEAH IT IS CERTAINLY A QUESTION

01:46:30.083 --> 01:46:32.886
OUR BROADER. PLAN AND I THINK

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:34.988
WHAT WE'RE HOPING FOR A SMALL.

01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:36.056
SUPPORT BECAUSE MORE THAN

01:46:36.123 --> 01:46:37.657
FEDERAL GOT. THE LAST WILL BE

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:39.493
DEPARTING THEIR OWN AND- OR THE

01:46:39.559 --> 01:46:41.928
GENERAL FUND. AS MISTER PATTON.

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:43.130
THAT IF I GOVERNMENT HAS TO

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:48.068
THAT THEY WILL NOT BE. CHARGING

01:46:48.135 --> 01:46:49.503
ANY INTO FIRST ON LOW. WITH THE

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:51.638
REMAINDER OF. TWENTY TWENTY. I

01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:52.339
THE GOVERNOR AT HIGH SPEED.

01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:53.206
ASKED IF I GOVERNMENT. TO

01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:54.341
EXTEND THAT DAY. I IN ADDITION

01:46:54.407 --> 01:46:55.609
TO. WHEN IT. TO THE- YEAH JUST

01:46:55.675 --> 01:46:56.877
THE ENTRENCHED. WE'RE HOPING

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:58.011
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:46:58.078 --> 01:46:59.713
WILL STEP UP AND PROVIDE. FOR

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.248
THEIR- THAT THERE IS WELL THEY

01:47:01.314 --> 01:47:02.783
HAD DONE IT WITH THE PANDEMIC.

01:47:02.849 --> 01:47:03.784
UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:05.552
PROGRAMS BUT THE SIX HUNDRED

01:47:05.619 --> 01:47:07.087
DOLLARS PER WEEK BOOST. AND

01:47:07.154 --> 01:47:07.687
WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY

01:47:07.754 --> 01:47:09.523
RECOGNIZE AS YOU NOTED MISTER

01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:10.857
OBERNOLTE THAT WE ARE REALLY AN

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:12.159
UNPRECEDENTED CIRCUMSTANCES

01:47:12.225 --> 01:47:14.027
HERE. AND SO WE'RE HOPING FOR

01:47:14.094 --> 01:47:15.262
THEIR ASSISTANCE AS WE WORK

01:47:15.328 --> 01:47:17.130
THROUGH THIS CRISIS. RIGHT

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:18.799
THANK YOU I THINK THIS IS AS

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:20.233
YOU SAY A DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE

01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:21.735
GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE-

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:23.570
HOWEVER. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:26.706
THAT. WE OUGHT TO HOLD

01:47:26.773 --> 01:47:29.509
EMPLOYERS HARMLESS FOR.

01:47:29.576 --> 01:47:30.610
REPAYMENT OF THAT PRINCIPLE

01:47:30.677 --> 01:47:31.678
SINCE THEY REALLY HAD NOTHING

01:47:31.745 --> 01:47:33.780
TO DO WITH- EITHER THE

01:47:33.847 --> 01:47:35.315
SITUATION THAT CAUSED. THE

01:47:35.382 --> 01:47:37.184
UNEMPLOYMENT OR OUR RECENT

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:38.785
DECISION TO BORROW BILLIONS OF

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:40.120
DOLLARS IN TITLE TWELVE LOANS

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:40.921
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:47:40.987 --> 01:47:42.656
SO. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:43.623

OR HIGH WATER. THAT THE BURDEN

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:49.196
OF REPAYING THIS PRINCIPLE IS

01:47:49.262 --> 01:47:51.364
NOT GOING TO FALL. ON THE BACKS

IS YOU KNOW. THE PROBLEMS THERE

01:47:56.203 --> 01:47:57.771
REALLY TO A KIND OF UNRELATED

01:47:57.838 --> 01:47:59.072
PROBLEMS AS A PROBLEMS OF

01:47:59.139 --> 01:48:00.373
REPAYING THE PRINCIPLE OF THOSE

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.374
LOANS THAT WERE MAKING THIS

01:48:01.441 --> 01:48:03.443
YEAR. THERE'S ALSO THE RELATED

01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:05.512
PROBLEM. THAT EMPLOYERS ARE

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:06.213
GOING TO FACE HIGHER

01:48:06.279 --> 01:48:07.647
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PREMIUMS

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:10.617
BECAUSE OF. THE CLAIMS AGAINST

01:48:10.684 --> 01:48:11.651
THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

01:48:11.718 --> 01:48:13.520
RESERVE ACCOUNTS AND THAT'S A

01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:14.187
PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE TO

01:48:14.254 --> 01:48:15.889
SINCE THAT'S ANOTHER-

01:48:15.956 --> 01:48:17.424
DIFFICULTY THAT REALLY THEY HAD

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:21.161
NO- THEY HAD NO- A PARTNERSHIP

01:48:21.228 --> 01:48:23.730

01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:25.165
ONE. LAST QUESTION IT WITH THE

01:48:25.232 --> 01:48:26.433
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THAT

01:48:26.499 --> 01:48:28.869
REGARDS WERE RELATES TO THE

01:48:28.935 --> 01:48:30.337
ENFORCEMENT OF AB FIVE SO I

01:48:30.403 --> 01:48:31.738
KNOW IT'S AN ONGOING DISCUSSION

01:48:31.805 --> 01:48:35.141
THAT WE- HAVE BEEN HAVING WITH

01:48:35.208 --> 01:48:36.576
THE MINISTRATION. BEFORE THIS

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:38.945
CRISIS SAID. THE PLAN WAS TO

01:48:39.012 --> 01:48:40.313
SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.915
STATE MONEY AND INCREASED

01:48:41.982 --> 01:48:44.017
ENFORCEMENT. FOR AB FIVE- BUT

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:45.018
I'M WONDERING IF THE CURRENT

01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:46.987
SITUATION CHANGES THOSE PLANS

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:49.556
BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO

01:48:49.623 --> 01:48:50.824
GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AS

01:48:50.891 --> 01:48:52.359
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ONE ANYWAY

01:48:52.425 --> 01:48:53.360
THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN IN

01:48:53.426 --> 01:48:54.928
CALIFORNIA. AND IT WOULD SEEM

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:57.564
LIKE ES- THE TESTIMONY TODAY

01:48:57.631 --> 01:48:58.932
WOULD INDICATE IF MORE OF OUR

01:48:58.999 --> 01:49:00.667
ECONOMY A SHIFTING TO WARDS

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:02.435
WORKING FROM HOME. THAT THAT'S

01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:03.637
SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO

01:49:03.703 --> 01:49:05.272
TAKE A PAUSE AND RETHINK. IN

01:49:05.338 --> 01:49:06.873

01:57:11.290 --> 01:57:13.326
SPECIFICALLY ENGAGED- WITH THE

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:14.827
COMMUNITIES THAT THEY WORK WITH

01:57:14.894 --> 01:57:16.028
OR THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT THEY

01:57:16.095 --> 01:57:17.764
WORK WITH. ON HOW TO MAKE SURE

01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:19.399
THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON WHAT IS

01:57:19.465 --> 01:57:21.134
MOST ESSENTIAL RIGHT NOW AND

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.735
THAT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:24.470
WILL UNNECESSARILY. AND KEEP

01:57:24.537 --> 01:57:26.072
THE RECOVERY OUT WE DON'T

01:57:26.139 --> 01:57:27.407
NECESSARILY FEEL THAT A

01:57:27.473 --> 01:57:29.742
BLANKET- REMOVAL OR PAUSE AND

01:57:29.809 --> 01:57:31.878
ALL REGULATIONS IS THE BEST WAY

01:57:31.944 --> 01:57:33.746
FORWARD HERE- GIVING HOW

01:57:33.813 --> 01:57:36.082
COMPLICATED THE SITUATION IS-

01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:37.450
BUT- IT'S DEFINITELY THE CASE

01:57:37.517 --> 01:57:38.618
THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT

01:57:38.684 --> 01:57:39.886
WE CAN DO TO MAKE THE RECOVERY

01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:42.889
A SPLIT AS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE

01:57:42.955 --> 01:57:44.257
CHALLENGES THAT WORK. CAN I.

01:57:44.323 --> 01:57:48.394
WAIT. WITH SO MUCH I HAVE BEEN

01:57:48.461 --> 01:57:53.099
THERE

01:57:53.166 --> 01:57:59.138
ART OR NO. SURE ABSOLUTELY. HI

01:57:59.205 --> 01:58:02.508
AS CHAIRMAN I YOU KNOW I HE I'M

01:58:02.575 --> 01:58:03.609
HEARING A LOT OF THE CONCERNS

01:58:03.676 --> 01:58:05.077
ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS AND OF

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:07.046
COURSE WE SHARE THEM I JUST

01:58:07.113 --> 01:58:09.749
WANT TO. ALL BUSINESS IN

01:58:09.816 --> 01:58:12.385
OPENING WILL RELY ON CONSUMERS

01:58:12.452 --> 01:58:15.855
WILL RELY ON PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY

01:58:15.922 --> 01:58:18.591
PURCHASE AT EAT OUT. AND IF

01:58:18.658 --> 01:58:20.092
WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:58:20.159 --> 01:58:22.595
CALIFORNIA ARE NOT GUARANTEED

01:58:22.662 --> 01:58:25.531
CERTAIN PROTECTIONS- INCOME THE

01:58:25.598 --> 01:58:27.366
ABILITY TO TAKE TIME OFF WHEN

01:58:27.433 --> 01:58:29.168
THEY'RE SICK THE ABILITY TO

01:58:29.235 --> 01:58:31.137
TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THEY

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:32.705
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONSUME AND

01:58:32.772 --> 01:58:34.974
SO I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:37.510
NOT- YES WE NEED TO LIFT ALL

01:58:37.577 --> 01:58:38.978
BOATS BUT THOSE BOATS HAVE TO

01:58:39.045 --> 01:58:40.880
INCLUDE WORKERS AND PROTECTIONS

01:58:40.947 --> 01:58:42.748
FOR WORKERS NOT JUST MOTHER. IS

01:58:42.815 --> 01:58:44.116
OTHERWISE THE SMALL BUSINESSES

01:58:44.183 --> 01:58:46.686
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SURVIVE

01:58:46.752 --> 01:58:47.687
WITHOUT CONSUMERS WHO CAN

01:58:47.753 --> 01:58:49.655
ACTUALLY THAT HAVE THE WHERE

01:58:49.722 --> 01:58:51.791
WITH ALL TO ACTUALLY SPEND ON

01:58:51.858 --> 01:58:53.426
TO ITS A CRITICAL THAT WE ARE

01:58:53.493 --> 01:58:55.194
NOT ONLY PROTECTING SMALL

01:58:55.261 --> 01:58:56.462
BUSINESS AND LOOKING AT WHAT

01:58:56.529 --> 01:58:59.131
REGULATIONS WE CAN- SUPPORT

01:58:59.198 --> 01:59:00.733
SMALL BUSINESS WITH BUT ALSO

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:02.969
NOT TAKING AWAY ALL PROTECTIONS

01:59:03.035 --> 01:59:04.637
FOR WORKERS AT THE SAME TIME.

01:59:04.704 --> 01:59:06.305
WHO WILL NEED PROTECTION IS TO

01:59:06.372 --> 01:59:08.207
BE ABLE TO SURVIVE THRIVE FEED

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:10.076
THEIR FAMILIES AND CONSUME SO I

01:59:10.142 --> 01:59:11.277
IS SO I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE

01:59:11.344 --> 01:59:12.945
THAT THAT THAT'S WHY THE

01:59:13.012 --> 01:59:14.347
QUESTION WAS SPECIFIC TO

01:59:14.413 --> 01:59:17.650
PAUSING ANY NEW NON COVE EIGHT

01:59:17.717 --> 01:59:19.552
NINETEEN RELATED REGULATIONS SO

01:59:19.619 --> 01:59:21.721
FOR EXAMPLE- BLARING ON

01:59:21.787 --> 01:59:24.090
REGULATIONS FROM CARP ON OUR

01:59:24.156 --> 01:59:26.826
PORTS- LAYERING ON. REGULATIONS

01:59:26.893 --> 01:59:28.895
ON OP OF OUR TRUCKING INDUSTRY

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:29.829
THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT

01:59:29.896 --> 01:59:31.797
LAYERING MORE REGULATIONS ARE

01:59:31.864 --> 01:59:32.932
AND THEY HELP MORE CHEESE

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:34.767
COMPANY THAT'S ACTUALLY TRYING

01:59:34.834 --> 01:59:36.102
TO PRODUCE CHEESE AND FOOD

01:59:36.168 --> 01:59:37.703
PRODUCTS FOR CALIFORNIANS

01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:40.039
DURING THIS CRITICAL TIME. IT

01:59:40.106 --> 01:59:41.707
WOULD MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT WE

01:59:41.774 --> 01:59:43.075
WANT TO ENSURE THAT THESE SMALL

01:59:43.142 --> 01:59:45.244
BUSINESSES CAN GROW THAT THEY

01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:47.547
CAN EXPAND THEY CAN RE HIGHER

01:59:47.613 --> 01:59:50.216
CALIFORNIANS SO THAT THEY CAN-

01:59:50.283 --> 01:59:51.484
THAT THEY CAN BEGIN TO

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:52.952
PARTICIPATE AND ACTUALLY

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:54.554
GENERATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. ON

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:55.922
A SIMILAR NOTE THE GOVERNMENT

01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:57.423
IS ALSO TAKING US A MEASURES

01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:59.058
PROVIDE CRITICAL ASSISTANCE TO

01:59:59.125 --> 01:59:59.959
SMALL BUSINESSES AND

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:01.360
INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING RIGHT

02:00:01.427 --> 02:00:02.962
NOW WOULD IT BE ADVISABLE AND

02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:05.231
WITH ADMINISTRATION AND THIS IS

02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:05.831
QUESTIONS THE PALMER FINANCES

02:00:05.898 --> 02:00:08.234
WELL. CREATE A MORATORIUM ON

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:10.503
NEW TAXES AND FEES SO THAT WE

02:00:10.570 --> 02:00:13.172
AREN'T ACTUALLY TAXING THE

02:00:13.239 --> 02:00:14.507
FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES

02:00:14.574 --> 02:00:23.416
THAT ARE RECEIVING RELIEF RIGHT.

02:00:23.482 --> 02:00:25.318
MR FOG ON THE QUESTION OF THAT

02:00:25.384 --> 02:00:28.421
THAT TAXES AND FEES- GENERALLY-

02:00:28.487 --> 02:00:30.790
AS YOU KNOW WE DON'T THAT TAXES

02:00:30.856 --> 02:00:33.159
OR FEES UNDER PROP TWENTY SIX

02:00:33.225 --> 02:00:35.628
REQUIRE- THAT. THE LEGISLATURE

02:00:35.695 --> 02:00:37.630
SO THE GOVERNOR'S FINALIZING

02:00:37.697 --> 02:00:38.931
THAT AT THE SCHOOL PLAN IN THE

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:40.700
NEXT TWO WEEKS SO I DON'T WANT

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:42.101
TO. GET AHEAD OF ANY DECISIONS

02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:43.703
THAT HE MAY MAKE- BUT WHEN IT

02:00:43.769 --> 02:00:45.571
COMES TO ANY NEW TAXES OR FEES

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:46.872
THAT FALL UNDER PROP TWENTY

02:00:46.939 --> 02:00:49.141
SIX- DOES GENERALLY WILL NOT GO

02:00:49.208 --> 02:00:50.943
FORWARD WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE

02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:53.012
APPROVAL. SO THE GOVERNOR IS

02:00:53.079 --> 02:00:55.247
CONTEMPLATING A MORATORIUM ON

02:00:55.314 --> 02:00:58.217
TAXES AND FEES BROADLY OR JUST

02:00:58.284 --> 02:01:00.119
FOR THAT SPECIFIC. YEAH I WOULD

02:01:00.186 --> 02:01:01.053
NOT SAY THE GOVERNOR'S

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:02.922
CONTEMPLATING A MORATORIUM I

02:01:02.989 --> 02:01:04.357
THINK I ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT

02:01:04.423 --> 02:01:05.424
THE GOVERNOR IS WORKING ON THE

02:01:05.491 --> 02:01:07.760
NAY REVISION BUDGET- AND WHEN

02:01:07.827 --> 02:01:09.629
IT COMES TO NEW TAXES AND FEES-

02:01:09.695 --> 02:01:11.897
THOSE GENERALLY ARE ENACTED FOR

02:01:11.964 --> 02:01:14.133
THE LEGISLATURE. SO THE

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:16.502
GOVERNOR IS IN AN AS IS LOOKING

02:01:16.569 --> 02:01:17.770

02:02:01.914 --> 02:02:03.949
REGULATORY RELIEF. I IN

02:02:04.016 --> 02:02:05.618

02:07:45.357 --> 02:07:49.395
LOT OF ROOM TO RELAX- OF-

02:07:49.461 --> 02:07:51.196

NEW REGULATIONS LOT AREAS THAT

02:07:53.132 --> 02:07:54.767
AREN'T CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT BUT

02:07:54.833 --> 02:07:56.502
RATHER WOULD HAVE A POSITIVE

02:07:56.568 --> 02:07:58.337
IMPACT ON BOTH EMPLOYERS AND

02:07:58.404 --> 02:08:01.607

GET THROUGH THIS ECONOMIC

02:08:28.934 --> 02:08:31.403
CRISIS YEAH I'VE SEEN. SEVERAL

GAMES WE'VE MADE.

02:08:39.445 --> 02:08:40.145
ENVIRONMENTALLY DURING THIS

02:08:40.212 --> 02:08:41.613
CRISIS THAT SOME OF THE

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.449
SLOWDOWN ACTIVITY HAS ACTUALLY

02:08:43.515 --> 02:08:44.616
HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT AND I

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:47.286

MUCH CLEANER WHICH CERTAINLY.

02:09:03.735 --> 02:09:05.204
BEGS THE QUESTION THOSE THAT

02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:08.874
HAVE. LAY IN THE AIR QUALITY

02:09:08.941 --> 02:09:10.008
ISSUES AT THE DOORSTEP OF

AGRICULTURE AND ARE REAL

02:09:11.877 --> 02:09:14.713
COMMUNITIES- MAY HAVE BEEN-

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:16.915
MISINFORMED OR MAY HAVE

02:09:16.982 --> 02:09:18.183
INTENTIONS THAT WE NEED TO

02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:20.119
TAKE. ANOTHER LOOK AT POST THIS

02:09:20.185 --> 02:09:24.323
CRISIS. I'D LIKE TO GOVERNOR TO

02:09:24.389 --> 02:09:26.258

02:09:26.325 --> 02:09:27.359
HOLIDAY BUT MAYBE MORE

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:29.728
APPROPRIATELY- TO RESPOND FROM

TASK FORCE THAT IS- BIPARTISAN

02:09:33.132 --> 02:09:34.199

SPECIFIC TARGETED. REGULATORY

02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:40.939
RELIEF- BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS

02:09:41.006 --> 02:09:43.108
AN EXCEPTIONAL POINT MAY WE

02:09:43.175 --> 02:09:45.144
DON'T WANT TO. INCREASE THE

02:09:45.210 --> 02:09:47.546
WEIGHT ON OUR SMALL BUSINESSES

02:09:47.613 --> 02:09:50.916
THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE.

02:09:50.983 --> 02:09:52.317

DISTRICTS TO SEE SMALL

BUSINESSES- ARE DENIED THE

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:09.868

THROUGH THIS VERY DIFFICULT

02:10:12.971 --> 02:10:14.339
TIME AND FRANKLY I THINK SOME

OF OUR BANKS. HAVE DONE A VERY

02:10:16.408 --> 02:10:19.144
POOR JOB- AND I REALIZE WE HAVE

02:10:19.211 --> 02:10:20.879
SOME LIMITATIONS TO WHAT THE

02:10:20.946 --> 02:10:22.481
FEDS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:10:22.548 --> 02:10:24.116
STATE REGULATE AS A GHOST BANKS

02:10:24.183 --> 02:10:25.517

02:10:25.584 --> 02:10:27.085
CHAIR HERE TODAY PARTICIPATING

THIS HEARING AND I WOULD

02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:30.289
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE HER TO TAKE

02:10:30.355 --> 02:10:32.191
A GOOD LOOK. AT WHAT ACTIONS

02:10:32.257 --> 02:10:34.526
CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE TO ENSURE

02:10:34.593 --> 02:10:35.460
THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE

02:10:35.527 --> 02:10:37.462
LINES OF CREDIT- TO MAKE IT

02:10:37.529 --> 02:10:38.263
THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT TIME

02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:39.531
JUST FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENT

02:10:39.598 --> 02:10:42.000
ON THAT ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:10:42.067 --> 02:10:47.673
PLANS GOING INTO THIS BUDGET.

02:10:47.739 --> 02:10:49.708
YES THANK YOU THROUGHOUT SAY

02:10:49.775 --> 02:10:51.610
VERY BRIEFLY NUMBER WHY AND- I

02:10:51.677 --> 02:10:53.912
THINK THAT SITUATION THAT. WE

02:10:53.979 --> 02:10:55.414
HAVE SEEN-WITH SOME OF THE

02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:56.415
ISSUES WITH THE PAYCHECK

02:10:56.481 --> 02:10:57.282
PROTECTION PROGRAM IN

02:10:57.349 --> 02:10:58.650
PARTICULAR WHICH IS I THINK.

02:10:58.717 --> 02:10:59.585
WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO AT

02:10:59.651 --> 02:11:01.220
THE FEDERAL LEVEL- GOVERNOR'S

02:11:01.286 --> 02:11:03.255
MAKE CLEAR THAT- THOSE ISSUES

02:11:03.322 --> 02:11:04.957
ARE UNACCEPTABLE THEY NEED TO

02:11:05.023 --> 02:11:07.292
BE FIXED. AND WHAT WE SAW IN

02:11:07.359 --> 02:11:08.594
THE BILL THAT PASSED THIS LAST

02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:10.729
WEEK WAS MAKING SURE THAT SOME

02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:12.598
OF THOSE ASSETS AT NEW WE

02:11:12.664 --> 02:11:14.499
PROVIDED. BY CONGRESS WILL BE

02:11:14.566 --> 02:11:16.301
CARVED OUT A SPECIFICALLY FOR

02:11:16.368 --> 02:11:17.402
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T

02:11:17.469 --> 02:11:19.738
REALLY GET THE ACCESS THAT THEY

02:11:19.805 --> 02:11:20.639
WERE ENTITLED TO. THE FIRST

02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:22.441
TIME- SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:11:22.507 --> 02:11:23.308
ISSUES BUT WHEN IT COMES TO

02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:24.610
SOME OF THE ISSUES OTHER ISSUES

02:11:24.676 --> 02:11:26.245
IN THE PROGRAM. CONGRESS HAS

02:11:26.311 --> 02:11:27.613
AFFECTS ALL OF THEM SO I THINK

02:11:27.679 --> 02:11:29.214
BAG GOVERNOR HAS CERTAINLY

02:11:29.281 --> 02:11:30.682
CALLED FOR MAKING SURE. THAT

02:11:30.749 --> 02:11:32.384
EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO THIS

02:11:32.451 --> 02:11:34.052
PROGRAM IT'S NOT PRIVILEGING.

02:11:34.119 --> 02:11:35.487
THE LARGEST LENDERS AND I'M A

02:11:35.554 --> 02:11:36.888
I'M SORRY THE LARGEST BORROWERS

02:11:36.955 --> 02:11:38.023
ARE THE MOST WELL CONNECTED

02:11:38.090 --> 02:11:39.424
BUSINESS AS BUT THAT ALL. SMALL

02:11:39.491 --> 02:11:40.926
BUSINESSES CAN AND ACCESS TO

02:11:40.993 --> 02:11:42.494
THE PROGRAM AND IN PARTICULAR I

02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:43.662
THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

02:11:43.729 --> 02:11:45.163
LAST COUPLE DAYS IS A LOT OF.

02:11:45.230 --> 02:11:46.698
NAMING AND SHAMING AROUND SOME

02:11:46.765 --> 02:11:47.899
OF THOSE BUSINESSES AND THAT

02:11:47.966 --> 02:11:49.134
MAY BE IMPORTANT TO MAKING

02:11:49.201 --> 02:11:51.036
SURE. THAT SOMEBODY'S LARGER

02:11:51.103 --> 02:11:52.337
MORE WELL KNOWN BUSINESSES ARE

02:11:52.404 --> 02:11:53.939
EXPLAINING THE PROGRAM. BUT I

02:11:54.006 --> 02:11:55.140
THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS

02:11:55.207 --> 02:11:56.808
A MORE SYSTEMATIC ISSUE THAT

02:11:56.875 --> 02:11:57.576
THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE VERY

02:11:57.643 --> 02:12:00.078
CLEAR- NEEDS TO BE FIXED. I

02:12:00.145 --> 02:12:01.446
THINK SECOND WHEN IT COMES TO

02:12:01.513 --> 02:12:02.214
THE STATE WE'RE DOING

02:12:02.281 --> 02:12:03.582
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN WITH THE

02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:05.183
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON BASE OF

02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:06.018
BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC

02:12:06.084 --> 02:12:07.653
DEVELOPMENT. IN MAKING SURE

02:12:07.719 --> 02:12:09.321
MORE AND MORE BORROWER IS A

02:12:09.388 --> 02:12:10.689
REALLY DO NEED THAT ASSISTANCE

02:12:10.756 --> 02:12:12.424
HAVE ACCESS TO THAT PROGRAMS.

02:12:12.491 --> 02:12:14.259
AND THEN FINALLY- AS YOU KNOW

02:12:14.326 --> 02:12:16.028
WE DID HAVE FIFTY MILLION

02:12:16.094 --> 02:12:17.796
DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA FOR

02:12:17.863 --> 02:12:18.964
STRUCTURE INVOLVING BANKS ALSO

02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:20.565
KNOWN AS THE AYE BANK I

02:12:20.632 --> 02:12:22.534
SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE ENTITIES

02:12:22.601 --> 02:12:23.935
THAT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.

02:12:24.002 --> 02:12:25.671
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE OR

02:12:25.737 --> 02:12:27.239
AND I COULD EASILY ACCESS SOME

02:12:27.306 --> 02:12:28.240
OF THE OTHER EIGHT INCLUDING

02:12:28.307 --> 02:12:29.374
THE FEDERAL AID. THAT WAS

02:12:29.441 --> 02:12:30.742
MENTIONED SO THESE ARE SOME OF

02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:32.811
THE TOOLS THAT WERE WORKING ON

02:12:32.878 --> 02:12:34.279
AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE DOING

02:12:34.346 --> 02:12:35.914
MORE ON THIS YOU KNOW LOOKING

02:12:35.981 --> 02:12:36.982
FOR THE NAY REVISION PROCESS

02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:39.117
THAT WHAT MORE. WE CAN DO- AND

02:12:39.184 --> 02:12:40.352
THEN AS YOU KNOW AND WE HAD A

02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:41.753
BRIEF DISCUSSION LAST WEEK

02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:42.988
ABOUT THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY

02:12:43.055 --> 02:12:44.523
TASK FORCE THAT THE GOVERNOR

02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:45.557
HAS STOOD OUT. THERE GOING TO

02:12:45.624 --> 02:12:49.995
BE FOCUSED. VERY MUCH ON THIS

02:12:50.062 --> 02:12:50.729
ISSUE. AS WELL SO SOME OF OUR

02:12:50.796 --> 02:12:51.263
TOOLS ARE. IN PARTICULAR

02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:52.164
BECAUSE OF THE DOWN. BUDGET

02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:54.032
REQUIREMENT WE WERE DISCUSSING.

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:55.133
BUT CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO

02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:55.934
MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S

02:12:56.001 --> 02:12:58.103
ACCESS- PUSHING OUR FEDERAL

02:12:58.170 --> 02:12:59.237
PARTNERS TO DO MORE AT THE

02:12:59.304 --> 02:13:00.572
GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION

02:13:00.639 --> 02:13:02.474
REALLY COMMITTED TO DOING EVERY.

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:03.942
WELL MAKE SURE THAT I DOUBLE

02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:05.811
DOWN ON MY COMMENTS THAT WE

02:13:05.877 --> 02:13:07.045
HOLD THESE INSTITUTIONS

02:13:07.112 --> 02:13:08.613
ACCOUNTABLE I KNOW MY DISTRICT

02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:09.614
SOME OF THE SMALLER COMMUNITY

02:13:09.681 --> 02:13:11.683
BANKS. SEEM TO HAVE NO PROBLEM

02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:12.784
GETTING LINES CURVED OUT TO

02:13:12.851 --> 02:13:13.618
THEIR CUSTOMERS WHILE THE

02:13:13.685 --> 02:13:16.355
LARGER NATIONAL BANKS-SEEM TO

02:13:16.421 --> 02:13:18.357
OR APPEAR TO. BE DRAGGING THEIR

02:13:18.423 --> 02:13:20.459
FEET IN SOME INSTANCES- IN A

02:13:20.525 --> 02:13:21.927
VERY UNACCEPTABLE WAY AND I

02:13:21.993 --> 02:13:23.995
HOPE- BOTH THE GOVERNOR. AND

02:13:24.062 --> 02:13:26.031
THE STATE LEGISLATURE HOLD THEM

02:13:26.098 --> 02:13:27.999
ACCOUNTABLE. FOR ANY ACTIVITY.

02:13:28.066 --> 02:13:29.568
RESEMBLING THAT. AND I WANT TO

02:13:29.634 --> 02:13:30.736
REITERATE I HOPE THAT WE CAN

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:32.738
WORK. WITH ADMINISTRATION WITH

02:13:32.804 --> 02:13:36.308
FINANCE AND OTHERS TO EXPLORE

02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:38.410
WAYS THAT WE CAN. PUT A

02:13:38.477 --> 02:13:41.980
TEMPORARY- EASE OF WATER BOARD

02:13:42.047 --> 02:13:44.015
AIRBOARD IT CETERA-

02:13:44.082 --> 02:13:45.517
IMPLEMENTATIONS ON NEW

02:13:45.584 --> 02:13:47.352
REGULATIONS THAT ARE COSTLY.

02:13:47.419 --> 02:13:48.920
AND DIFFICULT SO THAT WE CAN AT

02:13:48.987 --> 02:13:51.590
LEAST ALLOW THOSE BUSINESSES

02:13:51.656 --> 02:13:53.291
STILL FLOAT TO CONTINUE TO

02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:55.594
REMAIN FLOAT. I WANT TO MOVE

02:13:55.660 --> 02:13:58.764
NOW TO. STANDING ON THE SOCIAL

02:13:58.830 --> 02:14:01.433
WORKER NATURE OF MY DISTRICT

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:02.801
WHILE MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE

02:14:02.868 --> 02:14:04.169
BEEN SHELTER IN PLACE MAYBE THE

02:14:04.236 --> 02:14:05.904
PEOPLE I REPRESENT CONTINUE TO

02:14:05.971 --> 02:14:07.439
PRODUCE FOOD- AND TO DO THE

02:14:07.506 --> 02:14:08.840
CRITICAL WORK THAT ALLOWS ALL

02:14:08.907 --> 02:14:11.777

TRACKING THAT FOOD UP AND DOWN

02:14:19.785 --> 02:14:24.089
CALIFORNIA AND- IT IS TRAGIC

02:14:24.156 --> 02:14:26.091
THAT THOSE VERY WORKERS LIVING

02:14:26.158 --> 02:14:28.026
COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE

02:14:28.093 --> 02:14:30.162
ROBUST HEALTH CARE

02:14:30.228 --> 02:14:32.998
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE.

02:14:33.064 --> 02:14:34.599
TO PUT THAT VERY REAL TERMS IN

SAN FRANCISCO SITTING CARRY

02:14:36.168 --> 02:14:39.137

NINETY ONE POSITIONS PER ONE

02:14:45.177 --> 02:14:46.077
THOUSAND PEOPLE NOW THAT

02:14:46.144 --> 02:14:48.447
SHORTAGE IS- PLAYING ITSELF OUT

02:14:48.513 --> 02:14:49.648
VERY DANGEROUS WAYS DURING

02:14:49.714 --> 02:14:52.884
THIS- VERY- PUBLIC HEALTH

02:14:52.951 --> 02:14:54.786
CRISIS I JUST RECEIVED A LETTER

02:14:54.853 --> 02:14:56.822
FROM A PEDIATRICIAN MY DISTRICT

02:14:56.888 --> 02:14:59.057
THE OTHER DAY DOCTOR SAUDI. WHO

REIMBURSEMENT AND THE NEED TO

02:15:18.543 --> 02:15:20.312
INCREASE THOSE RATES ARE

02:15:20.378 --> 02:15:22.414
COMPARABLE TO WHAT WE SEE- IN

02:15:22.481 --> 02:15:24.382
THE FEDERAL SYSTEM- AS A WAY OF

02:15:24.449 --> 02:15:25.717
ECONOMIC STIMULUS AND I FULLY

GOVERNOR- PUTS THAT AT THE TOP.

02:15:29.621 --> 02:15:31.656
OF HIS PRIORITY LIST AS WE LOOK

02:15:31.723 --> 02:15:33.492

DIFFICULT BUDGET YEAR- IN IT

02:15:42.367 --> 02:15:43.935
MAY BE VERY DIFFICULT BUDGETING

02:15:44.002 --> 02:15:46.505
SEVERAL YEARS. BUT I'D LIKE TO

02:15:46.571 --> 02:15:47.472
CALL ON BOTH THE STATE

02:15:47.539 --> 02:15:49.307
LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION

02:15:49.374 --> 02:15:52.010
TO. LOOK TOWARDS A BLUE NEW

02:15:52.077 --> 02:15:54.713
DEAL. WHERE WE MAKE MAJOR

02:15:54.779 --> 02:15:56.681
INVESTMENTS IN NEW MEDICAL

02:15:56.748 --> 02:15:58.216

RESIDENCY SLOTS THINGS THAT

02:16:02.354 --> 02:16:05.991
HAVE FOR TOO LONG. BEEN IGNORED

02:16:06.057 --> 02:16:07.692
AND VERY MUCH TO OUR DETRIMENT

02:16:07.759 --> 02:16:09.394
AS WE STRUGGLE TO HAVE THE

02:16:09.461 --> 02:16:12.264
CAPACITY DURING THIS WORLD

02:16:12.330 --> 02:16:14.032
EVENT THAT WE'RE FACING WITH

02:16:14.099 --> 02:16:16.735
COVERT NINETEEN. JUST A FINANCE

02:16:16.801 --> 02:16:17.969
HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

02:16:18.036 --> 02:16:18.737
THEY'RE GOING TO PUT THE

02:16:18.803 --> 02:16:20.572
GOVERNOR'S DESK CONSISTENT WITH

02:16:20.639 --> 02:16:23.141
MY VISION FOR A NEW BLUE DEAL.

A BLUE NEW DEAL RATHER THAT.

02:16:27.045 --> 02:16:28.580

02:16:28.647 --> 02:16:29.648
NESTOR INVESTMENTS I KNOW THE

02:16:29.714 --> 02:16:31.583
JANUARY BUDGET FOR EXAMPLE HAD

MONEY IN IT FOR THE MED SCHOOL-

02:16:33.718 --> 02:16:35.086
IN THE VALLEY WANT TO SEE THAT

02:16:35.153 --> 02:16:36.121
CONTINUE BUT I THINK WHAT'S

02:16:36.187 --> 02:16:37.255
APPROPRIATE EVEN A BIGGER

02:16:37.322 --> 02:16:38.790
EXPANSION AGAIN I REALIZE THE

02:16:38.857 --> 02:16:40.258
DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE FEW AND

02:16:40.325 --> 02:16:42.360
FAR BETWEEN. ALTHOUGH THAT

02:16:42.427 --> 02:16:44.329
MEANS WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE-

02:16:44.396 --> 02:16:45.697
EVEN MORE THOSE THAT PRECIOUS

02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:46.898

INVESTMENTS IN THOSE AREAS.

02:16:56.107 --> 02:16:56.975
VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN MY

02:16:57.042 --> 02:16:58.577
COLLEAGUE ADAM DORSEY ON THE

02:16:58.643 --> 02:16:59.811
LINE AS WELL I THINK YOU

02:16:59.878 --> 02:17:01.479
REALLY. DESCRIBE THE TRADE

02:17:01.546 --> 02:17:03.582
OFFS. YEAH ACTUALLY THERE WHICH

02:17:03.648 --> 02:17:06.017
IS THAT. WE HAD TO ADD SOME OF

02:17:06.084 --> 02:17:07.018
THESE COMMITMENTS THAT WE WERE

02:17:07.085 --> 02:17:08.320
VERY EXCITED ABOUT BECAUSE

02:17:08.386 --> 02:17:09.421
THEY'RE SO IMPORTANT IN THE

02:17:09.487 --> 02:17:11.122
JANUARY BUDGET. AND NOW WE

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:12.557

YOU KNOW. PUT OUT A REVISED

02:17:20.231 --> 02:17:21.833
BUDGET THAT WILL HAVE CUTS BUT-

02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:22.968
MAKING SURE THAT WE REDUCE THE

02:17:23.034 --> 02:17:24.569
IMPACT TO MINIMIZE IT ON THE

02:17:24.636 --> 02:17:26.471
MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SO.

02:17:26.538 --> 02:17:27.906
SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND

02:17:27.973 --> 02:17:30.075
HELP- ARE CERTAINLY. AT THE TOP

02:17:30.141 --> 02:17:31.576
OF OUR WESTERN THINKING THROUGH

02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:32.544
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:33.812
CONTINUE GIVEN THAT WE'RE IN A

02:17:33.878 --> 02:17:35.780
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. MAKING

02:17:35.847 --> 02:17:36.181
SURE THAT WE HAVE

02:17:36.247 --> 02:17:37.916
INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED- BUT AT

02:17:37.983 --> 02:17:39.818
THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:40.852
THERE'S JUST YOUR DOLLARS

02:17:40.919 --> 02:17:42.754
AVAILABLE SO I CAN'T COMMENT ON

02:17:42.821 --> 02:17:44.422
THE SPECIFIC- ITEMS THAT YOU

02:17:44.489 --> 02:17:45.557
MENTIONED REGARDING IN MEDICAL

02:17:45.624 --> 02:17:47.192
SCHOOL AND- OTHER FUNDING-

02:17:47.259 --> 02:17:48.560
EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR

02:17:48.627 --> 02:17:49.561
IS LOOKING AT ALL THAT

02:17:49.628 --> 02:17:51.563
TOGETHER. IN CONTACT AS HE

02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:52.797
THINKS ABOUT WHERE TO PUT

02:17:52.864 --> 02:17:54.332
INVESTMENTS AND REVISED BUDGET.

02:21:14.599 --> 02:21:16.901
STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THEIR

02:21:16.968 --> 02:21:18.036
WORK FOR STERN THIS PANDEMIC

02:21:18.102 --> 02:21:19.904
CAN ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARILY

02:21:19.971 --> 02:21:21.940
VULNERABLE GROUP. IS ISOLATED

HELP FOR SENIORS THEY CAN LIVE

SAFE IN THEIR HOMES INSTEAD OF

NURSING HOMES AND HOSPITALS

02:21:32.517 --> 02:21:35.386
REDUCING COSTS FOR THE STATE- I

02:21:35.453 --> 02:21:36.588
THINK WE COULD SAFELY SAY THEIR

02:21:36.654 --> 02:21:38.756
WORK NOW IS PROBABLY MORE

02:21:38.823 --> 02:21:41.192

AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND-

02:21:46.598 --> 02:21:47.732

02:21:47.799 --> 02:21:49.634
DO THAT MANY OF OUR PROVIDERS

02:21:49.701 --> 02:21:51.536

OFFERED NO BENEFITS SO GIVEN

02:21:53.504 --> 02:21:55.740
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO RECRUIT

02:21:55.807 --> 02:21:57.575
MAINTAIN THIS WORKFORCE I HOPE

02:21:57.642 --> 02:21:59.677
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PLANS

02:21:59.744 --> 02:22:01.512

FINALIZES DECISIONS OVER THE

02:22:21.599 --> 02:22:24.102
COMING WEEKS OUT BUT I THINK

02:22:24.168 --> 02:22:24.669
THAT ALL NEEDS TO BE PART OF

02:22:24.736 --> 02:22:30.808

TO TAP THE EXPERTISE OF ALL OF

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:50.561

THEIR REALIZATION OF THE

02:22:53.765 --> 02:22:55.233
BUSINESS- BETTER THAN THE

02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:56.868
INDIVIDUALS TO WORK EVERY DAY

02:22:56.935 --> 02:22:58.736
IN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND

02:22:58.803 --> 02:23:01.372
BUSINESSES. AND I THINK THE

02:23:01.439 --> 02:23:03.041
GOVERNOR ADMINSTRATION

02:23:03.107 --> 02:23:05.143
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER-

02:23:05.209 --> 02:23:07.278

SAFELY WHEREVER WE ALL REALIZE

02:23:13.251 --> 02:23:13.918
THAT COVERT IS GOING TO BE AN

02:23:13.985 --> 02:23:16.621
EXTENDED- CHALLENGE AT SOME

02:23:16.688 --> 02:23:21.693

02:23:21.759 --> 02:23:24.195
SILVER BALL IT- SOLUTION OR A-

02:23:24.262 --> 02:23:25.930

IS MISPLACED. AND WE NEED TO

02:23:30.868 --> 02:23:32.670

02:23:32.737 --> 02:23:33.471
WE SHOULD ENGAGE ALL

02:23:33.538 --> 02:23:35.606
CALIFORNIA'S IN THAT PLANNING A

02:23:35.673 --> 02:23:37.108

MAKERS AND MARK UP YOU WANT TO

02:25:06.798 --> 02:25:08.900
ADD. THE ONLY THING I WOULD I'M

02:25:08.966 --> 02:25:10.435
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT I THINK

02:25:10.501 --> 02:25:11.936
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS WE LOOK

02:25:12.003 --> 02:25:13.571
AT THE SIX INDICATORS THAT THE

02:25:13.638 --> 02:25:15.273
GOVERNOR OUTLINED AN IMPORTANT

02:25:15.339 --> 02:25:18.443
ASPECT OF. THIS BUILDING OUT

02:25:18.509 --> 02:25:19.544
THOSE SIX INDICATORS AND

02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:20.912
DELIVERING ON THE STATE'S

02:25:20.978 --> 02:25:22.513
INTEREST IS BOTH OUR ENGAGEMENT

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:24.849
WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ON A

SECTOR MORE GENERALLY INDICATOR

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:33.758
FIVE IN PARTICULAR IS AROUND

02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:35.693
LOOKING AT- THE VARIOUS SECTORS

02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:37.328
OF OUR ECONOMY AND I THINK THAT

02:25:37.395 --> 02:25:39.530
IS AN AREA WHERE WE ARE REALLY

02:25:39.597 --> 02:25:42.066

THOSE ASPECTS MORE BURKE AS WE

02:25:47.338 --> 02:25:49.474
BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT

02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:50.408
THE POINT THAT I ALLUDED TO

02:25:50.475 --> 02:25:52.477
EARLIER AS WE BEGIN TO THINK

02:25:52.543 --> 02:25:53.778
ABOUT GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS TO

02:25:53.845 --> 02:25:55.480

02:25:57.415 --> 02:25:58.916
BEGIN THE RE OPENING PROCESS

02:25:58.983 --> 02:26:01.252
IT'S GONNA BE VERY OF OUR PRICE

02:26:01.319 --> 02:26:08.359
TO ENGAGE WITH AND WHY OUR.

02:26:08.426 --> 02:26:08.926
GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS TO HELP

02:26:12.363 --> 02:26:13.764

INTO A- PARTICULAR BUSINESS.

02:26:24.242 --> 02:26:24.909
AND THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT

02:26:24.976 --> 02:26:25.343
WE'RE GONNA NEED A

02:26:25.409 --> 02:26:26.911

IMMEDIATELY GO BACK TO HOW THEY

02:32:25.636 --> 02:32:28.405
ABOUT FINANCIAL PROTECTION- BUT

02:32:28.472 --> 02:32:30.608

02:32:30.674 --> 02:32:31.942
KNOW THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT

02:32:32.009 --> 02:32:33.477
TIME BUT IT IS A TIME WHEN WE

02:32:33.544 --> 02:32:35.379
CAN REALLY THINK ABOUT. WHAT

02:32:35.446 --> 02:32:36.947
SHOULD THE STRUCTURE OF OUR

02:32:37.014 --> 02:32:38.282
INSTITUTIONS BE HERE IN

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:40.451

IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANYTHING TO

ADD I THINK THAT THIS IS

02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:47.258
SOMETHING THAT SOME OF REAL

02:32:47.324 --> 02:32:48.492
CONCERN I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT

CONVERSATION I KNOW THAT- AT

02:33:07.444 --> 02:33:08.546

OVERSIGHT AND I HOPE THAT- IN

02:33:14.685 --> 02:33:16.487
LIGHT OF THIS- WE DON'T NEED

02:33:16.554 --> 02:33:18.088
LESS WE NEED. OUR CONSTITUENTS

02:33:18.155 --> 02:33:20.057

COLLEAGUE MARCO AS WELL MAY WE

02:34:21.485 --> 02:34:23.187
WANT TO SPEAK I THINK THE

02:34:23.253 --> 02:34:24.888
FIRST- WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF

02:34:24.955 --> 02:34:26.890
OUR FEDERAL ADVOCACY WE WANT TO

02:34:26.957 --> 02:34:28.392
MAKE SURE THAT THE AID THAT WE

02:34:28.459 --> 02:34:29.226
GET FROM THE FEDERAL

02:34:29.293 --> 02:34:31.028
GOVERNMENT- BOOK DIRECTLY TO

02:34:31.095 --> 02:34:33.197
THE STATE BUT ALSO- JUST

02:34:33.263 --> 02:34:35.132
GENERAL A THAT'S GOING OUT FROM

02:34:35.199 --> 02:34:36.166
CONGRESS. IS GOING TO NON

02:34:36.233 --> 02:34:37.935
PROFITS AS WELL AND SO I THINK

02:34:38.002 --> 02:34:39.103
IT IS WE TALKED ABOUT THE

02:34:39.169 --> 02:34:40.137
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM

02:34:40.204 --> 02:34:41.839
ALREADY BUT WANTING TO MAKE

02:34:41.905 --> 02:34:43.140
SURE THAT NON PROFITS ARE

02:34:43.207 --> 02:34:44.708
ELIGIBLE I NOT ONLY ELIGIBLE

02:34:44.775 --> 02:34:45.576
BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING

02:34:45.643 --> 02:34:46.910
THE ACCESS THAT THEY EAT WHEN

02:34:46.977 --> 02:34:48.512
IT COMES TO SPECIFICALLY TO THE

02:34:48.579 --> 02:34:50.147
STATE LEVEL I THINK WE HAVE A

02:34:50.214 --> 02:34:52.016
COUPLE OF EFFORTS AT FIRST OUT

02:34:52.082 --> 02:34:53.050
WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE

02:34:53.117 --> 02:34:54.318
APPROPRIATIONS THAT MY

02:34:54.385 --> 02:34:55.719
COLLEAGUE TO RESET DESCRIBED IN

02:34:55.786 --> 02:34:57.855
THE HEARING. LAST WEEK GOT MANY

02:34:57.921 --> 02:34:59.223
OF THEM WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS

02:34:59.289 --> 02:35:00.758
LIKE SUPPORTING FOOD BANKS AND

02:35:00.824 --> 02:35:02.326
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE GET THE

02:35:02.393 --> 02:35:04.128
SUPPORT THEY NEED- THOSE CLUBS

02:35:04.194 --> 02:35:06.930
ARE NOT PROFITS PERHAPS- ON A

02:35:06.997 --> 02:35:08.799
DIFFERENT SCALE- THE GOVERNOR'S

02:35:08.866 --> 02:35:10.901
AT SENIOR ADVISER ON SOCIAL

02:35:10.968 --> 02:35:12.136
INNOVATION KATHLEEN KELLY

02:35:12.202 --> 02:35:13.871
JANICE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH

02:35:13.937 --> 02:35:15.706
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WITH- YES

02:35:15.773 --> 02:35:18.275
WITH HHS I'M TRYING TO. GET AS

02:35:18.342 --> 02:35:20.477
MUCH SUPPORT AS WE CAN FROM

02:35:20.544 --> 02:35:22.880
OUTSIDE THERE IS- NON PROFITS

02:35:22.946 --> 02:35:23.681
AND OTHER COMMUNITY

02:35:23.747 --> 02:35:25.382
STAKEHOLDERS AND ENTITIES AND

02:35:25.449 --> 02:35:26.350
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS

02:35:26.417 --> 02:35:28.052
NUMBER ONE STEPPING UP WITH ALL

02:35:28.118 --> 02:35:28.786
THE RESOURCES WE CAN BRING TO

02:35:28.852 --> 02:35:31.221
BEAR TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS AND

02:35:31.288 --> 02:35:32.656
MORE IMPORTANT NUMBER TO MAKING

02:35:32.723 --> 02:35:34.091
SURE THAT WE ARE COORDINATED

02:35:34.158 --> 02:35:35.726
AND I THINK YOU SAW THAT WITH

02:35:35.793 --> 02:35:38.262
THE RELIEF- THAT THE GOVERNOR

02:35:38.328 --> 02:35:39.630
ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK. OR

02:35:39.697 --> 02:35:41.565
UNDOCUMENTED POPULATIONS WHO

02:35:41.632 --> 02:35:43.100
UNFORTUNATELY WERE LEFT OUT OF

02:35:43.167 --> 02:35:43.734
A LOT OF THE FEDERAL

02:35:43.801 --> 02:35:45.069
LEGISLATION THAT PASSED

02:35:45.135 --> 02:35:46.870
CONGRESS AND SO SOME OF THAT

02:35:46.937 --> 02:35:47.905
WAS A COMMITMENT OF STATE

02:35:47.971 --> 02:35:53.310
DOLLARS BUT SOME OF IT WAS ALSO.

02:35:53.377 --> 02:35:54.178
PRIVATE SECTOR NOT PROP DOLLARS

02:35:54.244 --> 02:35:55.379
AS WELL. SO MAY SURE THAT WE'RE

02:35:55.446 --> 02:35:56.046
ALL WORKING TOGETHER IS STEP. A

02:35:56.113 --> 02:35:57.448
BIG PART OF THE STRATEGY AND

02:35:57.514 --> 02:35:59.149
WERE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT

02:35:59.216 --> 02:36:01.085
THAT. EVEN THOUGH THE AD

02:36:01.151 --> 02:36:02.419
GENERAL FUND BUDGET THAT WE'RE

02:36:02.486 --> 02:36:03.420

02:36:06.557 --> 02:36:07.524
ALLOCATED IN THE NEXT SEVERAL

02:36:07.591 --> 02:36:09.727
WEEKS AND MONTHS- THAT IS THE

02:36:09.793 --> 02:36:11.295
PRODUCT OF STATE REVENUES AND

02:36:11.361 --> 02:36:13.063
FEDERAL FUNDING. WE ALSO WANT

02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:13.897

02:36:13.964 --> 02:36:15.365
STRATEGY OR YOU THAT'S

02:36:15.432 --> 02:36:16.633
INCORPORATING ALL THE ACTORS.

02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:17.768

WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT IN THE

02:36:36.053 --> 02:36:37.755
SPACE I THINK. MAKING SURE THAT

02:36:37.821 --> 02:36:39.189
WE ARE THE LINEMEN- AND

02:36:39.256 --> 02:36:42.092
LEVERAGING- THEIR INFORMATION

PROVIDED SPEED BACKGROUND I WE

02:36:50.968 --> 02:36:52.569
GET IT RIGHT OR IMPROVE WITH

02:36:52.636 --> 02:36:53.837
REGARDS RESPONSE ACTIVITIES IS

02:36:53.904 --> 02:36:55.606
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FACTOR.

02:36:55.672 --> 02:36:57.441
IN HOW WE DO BUSINESS SO I

02:36:57.508 --> 02:36:59.376
DIDN'T GET. I YOU KNOW I THINK

02:36:59.443 --> 02:37:00.544
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL

02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:06.383
CONTINUE TO BUILD ON AS WE-

02:37:06.450 --> 02:37:07.117
CONTINUE WITH THIS RESPONSE. SO

02:37:07.184 --> 02:37:09.520
I WANTED. THE IN THE REMARKS

02:37:09.586 --> 02:37:11.622
AROUND THAT I THINK IT'S AN-

02:37:11.688 --> 02:37:13.490
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:37:13.557 --> 02:37:15.225
TIME WE TALK ABOUT NON PROFITS

02:37:15.292 --> 02:37:16.960
AND WE HAVE NON PROFITS LIKE A

02:37:17.027 --> 02:37:17.995
FOOD BANK O LIKE THE

02:37:18.061 --> 02:37:20.130
INDIVIDUAL HEALTH- NONPROFITS

02:37:20.197 --> 02:37:21.431
IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT ALSO

02:37:21.498 --> 02:37:24.268
KAISER IS A NONPROFIT SO THE

02:37:24.334 --> 02:37:26.570
SCOPE OF NONPROFIT THIS HUGE IN

02:37:26.637 --> 02:37:28.605
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND

02:37:28.672 --> 02:37:30.374
WHILE WE COULD TALK ABOUT SOME

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:31.742
OF THE PARTNERSHIPS. NOT ALL

02:37:31.809 --> 02:37:32.910
ARE IN THE POSITION OF

02:37:32.976 --> 02:37:34.411
PHILANTHROPY THAT IS ONE

02:37:34.478 --> 02:37:35.846
SECTION OR ONE SECTOR OF THE

02:37:35.913 --> 02:37:38.649
NONPROFIT INDUSTRY AND SO-

02:37:38.715 --> 02:37:40.150
THERE IS STILL MUCH TO DO

02:37:40.217 --> 02:37:41.718
BECAUSE AS THE FOURTH LARGEST

02:37:41.785 --> 02:37:43.253
EMPLOYER OF THIS STATE

02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:46.089
NONPROFITS NOT BEING ABLE TO.

02:37:46.156 --> 02:37:48.725
KEEP FOLKS EMPLOYED- EIGHT IS

02:37:48.792 --> 02:37:51.028
GOING TO BE A VERY BIG ISSUE-

02:37:51.094 --> 02:37:53.163
AND THIS IS SIMILAR TO I THINK

02:37:53.230 --> 02:37:54.231
SOME OF THECOMMENTS I'VE HEARD

02:37:54.298 --> 02:37:55.632
RELATED TO THE FIFTY MILLION

02:37:55.699 --> 02:37:59.136
RELATED TO THAT I THINK. THAT

02:37:59.203 --> 02:38:01.738
THAT IS A GOOD START BUT AT AN

02:38:01.805 --> 02:38:03.273
END AND CERTAINLY THE SUPPORT

02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:04.875
THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO OUR AND

02:38:04.942 --> 02:38:06.944
DOCUMENTED- ESSENTIAL WORKERS

02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:09.146
IS AN INCREDIBLE START BUT IT'S

02:38:09.213 --> 02:38:11.748
GOING TO LEAVE HOLES THAT AND

02:38:11.815 --> 02:38:13.684
NEEDS THAT ARE AND MATT SO

02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:15.452
WHETHER IT'S A SMALL BUSINESSES

02:38:15.519 --> 02:38:18.188
THAT DIDN'T GET PPP. AT BEING

02:38:18.255 --> 02:38:19.456
ABLE OR NOT BEING ABLE TO

02:38:19.523 --> 02:38:20.724
ACCESS SOME OF THE FUNDS IN THE

02:38:20.791 --> 02:38:22.025
AYE BANK IT'S ACTUALLY NOT

02:38:22.092 --> 02:38:23.694
RELATIVELY THAT MUCH FOR THE

02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:24.928
NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT

02:38:24.995 --> 02:38:27.631
WE HAVE AND SO- I A THINK THAT

02:38:27.698 --> 02:38:29.633
I HOPE WE TRANSITION FROM

02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:31.835
CHECKING OFF A BOX AND ST WE

02:38:31.902 --> 02:38:33.503
DID THIS FOR THIS GROUP THIS

02:38:33.570 --> 02:38:35.572
FOR THE OTHER GROUP- TO ALSO

02:38:35.639 --> 02:38:37.641
START TO THINK ABOUT WE HAVE

02:38:37.708 --> 02:38:39.309
UNMET NEEDS AND GAPS THAT. ARE

02:38:39.376 --> 02:38:41.078
STILL NOT THERE AND WE SHOULD

02:38:41.144 --> 02:38:43.313
BE RECOGNIZED FOR BEING LEADERS

02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:45.148
AND THE FIRST- AND MAYBE THE

02:38:45.215 --> 02:38:46.917
ONLY STATE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

02:38:46.984 --> 02:38:48.485
IS DOING SOME OF THESE THINGS

02:38:48.552 --> 02:38:49.887
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING T

02:38:49.953 --> 02:38:52.689
BE ENOUGH BASED ON WHAT MEMBERS

02:38:52.756 --> 02:38:54.591
ARE SEEN WHAT PUTTING TOGETHER

02:38:54.658 --> 02:38:56.293
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SO

02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:57.995
YOU KNOW I ADD THAT THERE AND

02:38:58.061 --> 02:38:59.496
THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT IS

02:38:59.563 --> 02:39:00.764
FULL RESPONSIBILITY THE

02:39:00.831 --> 02:39:02.299
ADMINISTRATION I THINK THAT THE

02:39:02.366 --> 02:39:04.434
LEGISLATURE- IT SHOULD HAVE A

02:39:04.501 --> 02:39:05.702
ROLE IN SHOULD BE CHIMING IN ON

02:39:05.769 --> 02:39:07.504
HOW WE NEED SOME OF THOSE AND-

02:39:07.571 --> 02:39:08.939
IT NEEDS. BUT RECOGNIZE THAT

02:39:09.006 --> 02:39:10.507
WHILE THIS IS A GREAT STEP AND

02:39:10.574 --> 02:39:12.242
THESE ARE GREAT FIGHT FIRST AND

02:39:12.309 --> 02:39:13.477
THEY PUT CALIFORNIA THE LEAD.

02:39:13.543 --> 02:39:15.212
THERE IS STILL MORE TO DO

02:39:15.279 --> 02:39:17.014
BECAUSE WE HAVE SERIOUS UNMET

02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:19.016
NEEDS FOR ALL OF THESE

02:39:19.082 --> 02:39:22.486
COMMUNITIES- SO. I BELIEVE THAT

02:39:22.552 --> 02:39:23.453
THERE IN IN TERMS OF NON

02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:25.822
PROFITS- MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:39:25.889 --> 02:39:28.926
MODESTO ALSO TALKED ABOUT AND

02:39:28.992 --> 02:39:30.661
THAT THE RATIO TO MEDICAL

02:39:30.727 --> 02:39:32.362
PROVIDERS IN COMMUNITIES AND

02:39:32.429 --> 02:39:35.098
SOMETIMES I THINK ON THAT- YOU

02:39:35.165 --> 02:39:36.600
KNOW ON THE- OUTER LEVEL WE

02:39:36.667 --> 02:39:37.834
DON'T THINK THAT COMMUNITIES

02:39:37.901 --> 02:39:39.436
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MODESTO OR

02:39:39.503 --> 02:39:40.804
SANTA BARBARA MIGHT HAVE A LOT

02:39:40.871 --> 02:39:42.339
IN COMMON. BUT IT TURNS OUT

02:39:42.406 --> 02:39:44.374
THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE-

02:39:44.441 --> 02:39:46.810
IT'S HITTING COMMUNITIES VERY

02:39:46.877 --> 02:39:49.446
HARD- AND I THINK THAT THIS

02:39:49.513 --> 02:39:51.481
IDEA THAT CERTAIN COMMUNITIES-

02:39:51.548 --> 02:39:52.816
WHO MIGHT BE QUOTE UNQUOTE

02:39:52.883 --> 02:39:55.218
BETTER OFFER NOT BETTER OFF.

02:39:55.285 --> 02:39:56.787
AND YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE

02:39:56.853 --> 02:39:58.922
IMPACTED IN DIFFERENT WAYS- IT

02:39:58.989 --> 02:40:00.190
TURNS OUT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:03.026
MEDICAL SERVICES AND PROVIDERS-

02:40:03.093 --> 02:40:05.462
WE HAVE REAL CONCERNS AND A LOT

02:40:05.529 --> 02:40:07.564
OF SIMILARITIES- SANTA BARBARA

02:40:07.631 --> 02:40:09.399
COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE-

02:40:09.466 --> 02:40:11.635
METROPOLITAN. URBAN AREA LIKE

02:40:11.702 --> 02:40:13.470
SOME OF THE BIG CITIES DO. AND

02:40:13.537 --> 02:40:16.039
WHEN I WATCH- COMMUNITY CLINICS

02:40:16.106 --> 02:40:19.042
LIKE SAMPSON THAT PROVIDES ONE.

02:40:19.109 --> 02:40:21.778
THIRD OF THE ENTIRE CAL ANNE'S.

02:40:21.845 --> 02:40:26.249
MEDI CAL SERVICES- THAT IS NOW

02:40:26.316 --> 02:40:28.051
FIFTEEN MILLION- INTO THEIR

02:40:28.118 --> 02:40:30.020
LINE OF CREDIT THAT IS GOING

02:40:30.087 --> 02:40:32.289
DOWN- AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

02:40:32.356 --> 02:40:34.024
SURVIVE I THINK OF THE

02:40:34.091 --> 02:40:36.193
SIMILARITIES THAT. ARE COUNTY

02:40:36.259 --> 02:40:37.661
HAS WITH COUNTIES LIKE

02:40:37.728 --> 02:40:39.162
STANISLAUS RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE

02:40:39.229 --> 02:40:40.764
LIKE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IF

02:40:40.831 --> 02:40:42.399
YOU DON'T HAVE INDIVIDUALS. ARE

02:40:42.466 --> 02:40:44.001
HEALTHY THEY CANNOT GO BACK TO

02:40:44.067 --> 02:40:47.437
WORK AND WE ARE WATCHING. OUR

02:40:47.504 --> 02:40:50.707
MEDICAL. AID YOU KNOW CENTERS-

02:40:50.774 --> 02:40:52.209
REALLY BE CRIPPLED AND

02:40:52.275 --> 02:40:53.677
CERTAINLY LAST YOU KNOW WEEKS

02:40:53.744 --> 02:40:55.846
ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT BEING ABLE

02:40:55.912 --> 02:40:58.582
TO PROVIDE- SOME OF THE MEDICAL

02:40:58.648 --> 02:41:00.217
PROCEDURES AND SELECT TO US

02:41:00.283 --> 02:41:02.152
SURGERIES IS GOING TO HELP. BUT

02:41:02.219 --> 02:41:03.320
IT GOES BACK TO MY PREVIOUS

02:41:03.387 --> 02:41:04.621
COMMENT THAT WHILE WE CAN

02:41:04.688 --> 02:41:05.956
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME OF THIS

02:41:06.023 --> 02:41:07.124
HELPS IT DOESN'T SOLVE FOR THE

02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:09.760
PROBLEM. SO I THINK I HAVE

02:41:09.826 --> 02:41:11.828
HEARD EXAMPLES ALL THROUGHOUT

02:41:11.895 --> 02:41:12.896
THE STATE OF MEDICAL PROVIDERS

02:41:12.963 --> 02:41:16.033
WHO ARE SEEN THEMSELVES- ON THE

02:41:16.099 --> 02:41:17.934
VERGE OF GOING DOWN NOT KNOWING

02:41:18.001 --> 02:41:19.770
IF THEY WILL BE ABLE TO EXIST

02:41:19.836 --> 02:41:21.338
AND ALSO LEGISLATORS

02:41:21.405 --> 02:41:23.340
RECOGNIZING THAT WITHOUT THEM.

02:41:23.407 --> 02:41:24.808
WE CANNOT CARE FOR OUR

02:41:24.875 --> 02:41:26.376
COMMUNITY THERE IS NO WAY THAT

02:41:26.443 --> 02:41:28.378
EVERY SINGLE HOSPITAL IN THIS

02:41:28.445 --> 02:41:31.648
STATE CAN PICK UP- AND SOLVE

02:41:31.715 --> 02:41:32.816
FOR THE ABSENCE OF MEDICAL

02:41:32.883 --> 02:41:34.051
CENTERS AND OTHER MEDICAL

02:41:34.117 --> 02:41:35.952
PROVIDERS BOTH ARE CRITICALLY

02:41:36.019 --> 02:41:37.854
NEEDED. SO I'M WONDERING IF THE

02:41:37.921 --> 02:41:39.589
ADMINISTRATION CAN COMMENT ON

02:41:39.656 --> 02:41:41.358
MORE THOUGHTS BESIDES WHAT WAS

02:41:41.425 --> 02:41:42.459
DONE LAST WEEK AND THE

02:41:42.526 --> 02:41:43.794
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS DONE LAST

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:46.163
WEEK ON WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO

02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:47.798
BUT TO PROVIDE. SUPPORT TO

02:41:47.864 --> 02:41:49.933
COMMUNITIES OF ALL DIFFERENT

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.169
SHAPES SIZES COLORS EVERYTHING

02:41:52.235 --> 02:41:58.842
I'M IN THE STATE. ASSEMBLY

02:41:58.909 --> 02:42:00.644
MEMBER I WILL TURN IT OVER TO

02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:06.450
MY COLLEAGUE ADAM DORSEY. I

02:42:06.516 --> 02:42:08.885
THINK- SIMILAR TO SOME OF OUR

02:42:08.952 --> 02:42:10.454
CURRENT COMMENTS THAT YOU KNOW

02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:12.556
I THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE

02:42:12.622 --> 02:42:14.091
THE FEDERAL RESOURCES REALLY

02:42:14.157 --> 02:42:15.358
KIND OF NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO

02:42:15.425 --> 02:42:16.993
BEAR TO STABILIZE THE

02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:19.729
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND- I THINK

02:42:19.796 --> 02:42:21.298
THAT WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE IN

02:42:21.364 --> 02:42:24.067
THAT. KERR'S ACTOR AND GAVE

02:42:24.134 --> 02:42:25.735
PROVIDE FUNDING THAT OUR

02:42:25.802 --> 02:42:27.270
PROVIDERS ARE BEING ABLE TO

02:42:27.337 --> 02:42:30.107
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. AND WE

02:42:30.173 --> 02:42:31.842
LEARNED THIS MORNING OF A

02:42:31.908 --> 02:42:34.244
SECOND BATCH OF FEDERAL FUNDING

02:42:34.311 --> 02:42:36.379
THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE- IN THE

02:42:36.446 --> 02:42:38.582
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO-

02:42:38.648 --> 02:42:40.150
DOES THE BAND IN IN THE

02:42:40.217 --> 02:42:42.452
BILLIONS- ANSWER WE BELIEVE

02:42:42.519 --> 02:42:44.321
THAT THAT. WILL REALLY IS HER

02:42:44.387 --> 02:42:45.489
TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE IN THE

02:42:45.555 --> 02:42:47.624
SHORT TERM AND REALLY. HELPING

02:42:47.691 --> 02:42:50.560
TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM- AND SO

02:42:50.627 --> 02:42:51.962
THAT IS WHERE OUR EFFORTS ALL

02:42:52.028 --> 02:42:55.832
RIGHT NOW. AND IT WAS-

02:42:55.899 --> 02:42:57.901
TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL- SO FOUR

ANNOUNCED- JUST A FEW WEEKS

02:43:05.308 --> 02:43:08.178
AGO. AND BUT WE ARE GOING TO

02:43:08.245 --> 02:43:10.080
LET THAT PROCESS AND KIND OF

02:43:10.147 --> 02:43:11.081
WORK THROUGH THE SYSTEM

02:43:11.148 --> 02:43:13.650
STABILIZE THE SYSTEM. AND THEN

02:43:13.717 --> 02:43:15.118

02:43:32.135 --> 02:43:34.204
FEDERAL FUNDING LOOKING AT

02:43:34.271 --> 02:43:36.806
HEALTH PLANS- PROVIDING SELECT

02:43:36.873 --> 02:43:38.575

I WANT TO SAY THAT THERE'S NO

02:43:54.824 --> 02:43:57.294
DOUBT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT

02:43:57.360 --> 02:43:58.828
EVERYBODY IN THE ADMINISTRATION

02:43:58.895 --> 02:44:01.865
IS WORKING SO INCREDIBLY HARD-

02:44:01.932 --> 02:44:05.268
ON THIS I A THINK IT'S JUST A-

02:44:05.335 --> 02:44:06.770
I'M NOT AS CONVINCED THAT THE

02:44:06.836 --> 02:44:08.138
FEDERAL FUNDING IS GOING TO

02:44:08.205 --> 02:44:10.340

WISH IT WORK- BUT TO AT. A

02:44:13.143 --> 02:44:14.110
THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE

TO WORK TOGETHER INCLUDING

02:44:15.645 --> 02:44:19.115
LEGISLATORS. AND MY FINAL.

02:44:19.182 --> 02:44:22.118
QUESTION THAT HAS TO DO WITH

02:44:22.185 --> 02:44:23.853
THE CUT TOPIC THAT CAME UP LAST

02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:24.888
WEEK AND I'M WONDERING IF THE

02:44:24.955 --> 02:44:26.890
ADMINISTRATION PERHAPS HAS MORE

02:44:26.957 --> 02:44:30.126
INFORMATION- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS-

02:44:30.193 --> 02:44:32.128
WITH POPULATIONS CENTS LESS

02:44:32.195 --> 02:44:34.231
THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND-

02:44:34.297 --> 02:44:35.332
LOCAL COUNTY GOVERNMENTS WITH

02:44:35.398 --> 02:44:36.933
POPULATIONS LESS THAN FIVE

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:37.867
HUNDRED THOUSAND. HAVE NOT

02:44:37.934 --> 02:44:39.336
RECEIVED THE SAME LEVEL OF

02:44:39.402 --> 02:44:42.505
SUPPORT AND LOCAL- LARGER

02:44:42.572 --> 02:44:44.341
GOVERNMENTS SO WHAT CAN WE

02:44:44.407 --> 02:44:47.911
EXPECT- ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY

02:44:47.978 --> 02:44:49.679
FOR IT THESE COUNTIES- THERE

02:44:49.746 --> 02:44:51.815
ARE MANY OUT IN THE STATE. AND

02:44:51.881 --> 02:44:55.051

AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE DO

02:45:00.123 --> 02:45:01.157
HAVE MORE INFORMATION IN THE

02:45:01.224 --> 02:45:02.892
LAST WEEK. I'M WHAT WE CAN TELL

02:45:02.959 --> 02:45:05.595
OUR COUNTIES AND THAT DID NOT

02:45:05.662 --> 02:45:11.434
RECEIVE THIS DIRECT FUNDING. WE

02:45:11.501 --> 02:45:13.837
CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON WE

02:45:13.903 --> 02:45:15.839
KNOW ESPECIALLY WITH COUNTIES-

02:45:15.905 --> 02:45:18.341
WE ARE- YOU KNOW THE STATE AND

02:45:18.408 --> 02:45:19.909
LOCALS ARE YOUR PARTNER SO

02:45:19.976 --> 02:45:21.778
CLOSELY IN TERMS OF THESE KEY.

02:45:21.845 --> 02:45:23.747
SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS AND

02:45:23.813 --> 02:45:26.216
THAT OF THE OVERALL FIFTEEN

02:45:26.283 --> 02:45:27.917
POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS.

02:45:27.984 --> 02:45:29.185
THAT WAS PART OF THE CARE IS

02:45:29.252 --> 02:45:30.387
ABSENT A CORONA VIRUS OR WE

02:45:30.453 --> 02:45:32.255
FIND AT NINE POINT FIVE BILLION

02:45:32.322 --> 02:45:34.357
DOLLARS I WAS ALLOCATED TO THE

02:45:34.424 --> 02:45:35.659
STATE- AND THEN THE BALANCE AS

02:45:35.725 --> 02:45:37.427
YOU MENTIONED WAS ALLOCATED TO.

02:45:37.494 --> 02:45:39.095
I BELIEVE TWENTY ONE NOW LOCAL

02:45:39.162 --> 02:45:40.830
GOVERNMENTS COUNTIES AND

02:45:40.897 --> 02:45:44.601
CITIES. I THINK. WHAT WE AT.

02:45:44.668 --> 02:45:45.869
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

02:45:45.935 --> 02:45:47.037
BELIEVES IS THAT WE WANT TO

02:45:47.103 --> 02:45:48.071
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SPENDING

02:45:48.138 --> 02:45:49.306
THOSE DOLLARS IN A WAY THAT

02:45:49.372 --> 02:45:51.608
BENEFITS. THE WHOLE STATE SO UP

02:45:51.675 --> 02:45:52.776
UNTIL THE GOVERNOR MAKES HIS

02:45:52.842 --> 02:45:53.843
DECISIONS AND PUTS OUT HIS

02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:55.378
PROPOSAL WE CAN'T GIVE A

02:45:55.445 --> 02:45:57.414
SPECIFIC BREAKDOWN ON HOW THOSE

02:45:57.480 --> 02:45:59.282
DOLLARS WILL BE SPENT BECAUSE

02:45:59.349 --> 02:46:00.016
THE GOVERNOR HASN'T MADE THAT

02:46:00.083 --> 02:46:01.885
DECISION YET. IT'S ALSO A

02:46:01.951 --> 02:46:03.853
CHALLENGE BECAUSE WHILE WE WANT

02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:04.387
TO DO AND ARE GOING TO DO

02:46:04.454 --> 02:46:05.622
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN HELP

02:46:05.689 --> 02:46:07.357
SUPPORT OUR LOCAL PARTNERS

02:46:07.424 --> 02:46:09.326
COUNTIES CITIES. SCHOOL

02:46:09.392 --> 02:46:10.293
DISTRICTS OTHER LOCAL

JURISDICTIONS WE ALSO HAVE A

CAL WORKS AND- AM APPRECIATIVE

03:01:16.432 --> 03:01:18.567
OF IT. I'M SENSITIVE TO THE

03:01:18.634 --> 03:01:20.469
FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE ON CAL

03:01:20.536 --> 03:01:22.838
WORKS ARE ON TIME CLOCKS. AND

03:01:22.905 --> 03:01:24.640
DURING THIS CRISIS WE HAVEN'T

03:01:24.707 --> 03:01:26.642
PAUSED THOSE TIME CLOCKS ARE

03:01:26.709 --> 03:01:29.078
STOPPED THOSE TIME CLOCKS. AND

03:01:29.144 --> 03:01:30.379
IN ESSENCE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

03:01:30.446 --> 03:01:33.682
LIMITING- THOSE- A RESOURCE TO

03:01:33.749 --> 03:01:36.652
THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST IN A

03:01:36.719 --> 03:01:37.119
TIME WHEN THEY'RE MOST

03:01:37.186 --> 03:01:38.387
VULNERABLE. I WOULD LIKE TO GET

03:01:38.454 --> 03:01:44.260
THE A MINISTRY. HI THIS IS THAT

03:01:44.326 --> 03:01:45.194
THEY ARE ADAM YOU WANT TO GO

03:01:45.261 --> 03:01:49.298
FIRST. CERTAINLY I MEAN I THINK

03:01:49.365 --> 03:01:51.600
THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

03:01:51.667 --> 03:01:52.901
THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

03:01:52.968 --> 03:01:54.637
US TO EVALUATE IS THAT YOU KNOW

03:01:54.703 --> 03:01:55.971
THIS IS BàN I'M SUCH AN

03:01:56.038 --> 03:01:57.706
UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION AND

03:01:57.773 --> 03:02:00.609
WE'RE MOVING SO QUICKLY. YOU

03:02:00.676 --> 03:02:03.012
KNOW AS WE TRY TO RESPOND TO

03:02:03.078 --> 03:02:05.147
THE CRISIS AND I THINK THAT

03:02:05.214 --> 03:02:06.815
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT A LOT

03:02:06.882 --> 03:02:08.117
OF THESE FLEXIBILITY IS WE'RE

03:02:08.183 --> 03:02:10.419
STILL SORT OF EVALUATING- BUT

03:02:10.486 --> 03:02:12.388
WHAT THE COSTS ARE NAMED SO AS

03:02:12.454 --> 03:02:13.722
WE GET INTO THE BUDGET

03:02:13.789 --> 03:02:15.024
CONVERSATION I DON'T THINK THAT

03:02:15.090 --> 03:02:16.759
WE CAN COMMIT TO OUTCOMES RIGHT

03:02:16.825 --> 03:02:18.193
NOW BECAUSE WE'RE STILL WORKING

03:02:18.260 --> 03:02:20.062
ON DEVELOPING THE REVISION BUT-

03:02:20.129 --> 03:02:20.996
I THINK WE CAN COMMIT TO A

03:02:21.063 --> 03:02:22.431
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE

03:02:22.498 --> 03:02:23.799
PRIORITIZE SOME OF THE

03:02:23.866 --> 03:02:25.434
FLEXIBILITY IS THAT WE- SHOULD

03:02:25.501 --> 03:02:27.436
ON SHORT TERM BASIS. EVERYTHING

03:02:27.503 --> 03:02:29.672
ELSE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND

03:02:29.738 --> 03:02:31.073
FUNDED TO PRIORITIZE PART OF A

03:02:31.140 --> 03:02:33.976
BUDGET YOU KNOW AGREEMENT AT

03:02:34.043 --> 03:02:35.944
THE END OF THE- FISCAL YEAR.

03:02:36.011 --> 03:02:37.513
AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND LOOK

03:02:37.579 --> 03:02:39.348
FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

03:02:39.415 --> 03:02:41.950
IF I CAN I'D LIKE TO TURN THE

03:02:42.017 --> 03:02:43.652
CONVERSATION TO THE EMERGENCY

03:02:43.719 --> 03:02:45.187
AID FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED

03:02:45.254 --> 03:02:46.889
COMMUNITY. AND I WANT TO START

03:02:46.955 --> 03:02:48.757
BY THANKING THE ADMINISTRATION

03:02:48.824 --> 03:02:49.792
FOR THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

03:02:49.858 --> 03:02:52.428
DOLLAR DISASTER RELIEF FUND.

03:02:52.494 --> 03:02:53.729
FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY

03:02:53.796 --> 03:02:55.698
WHICH IS FUNDED THROUGH- THE

03:02:55.764 --> 03:02:57.533
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES.

03:02:57.599 --> 03:02:59.168
NOW THIS CURRENT FUND IS

03:02:59.234 --> 03:03:01.403
DESIGNED TO REACH A HUNDRED AND

03:03:01.470 --> 03:03:02.371
FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS

03:03:02.438 --> 03:03:04.106
ALTHOUGH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET

03:03:04.173 --> 03:03:06.542
CENTER ESTIMATES THAT. THE

03:03:06.608 --> 03:03:08.277
NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE

03:03:08.344 --> 03:03:09.978
AFFECTED BY THIS CRISIS IS

03:03:10.045 --> 03:03:11.847
THREE TIMES THAT AMOUNT.

03:03:11.914 --> 03:03:13.415
RECENTLY THE LEGISLATIVE

03:03:13.482 --> 03:03:15.551
CAUCUSES HAVE NOW WAIT IN WITH

03:03:15.617 --> 03:03:17.519
THE REQUEST FOR A MODICUM OF

03:03:17.586 --> 03:03:19.722

03:03:19.788 --> 03:03:21.290
CALIFORNIANS WHO WOULD

03:03:21.357 --> 03:03:22.925
OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL

03:03:22.991 --> 03:03:25.260

03:03:25.327 --> 03:03:27.563
AND SO I WANT TO ASK. WHAT IS

03:03:27.629 --> 03:03:29.932
THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE

03:03:29.998 --> 03:03:31.633
TO THE RECENT LETTER FROM THE

03:03:31.700 --> 03:03:36.638
LATINO. BLACK API JEWISH AN

03:03:36.705 --> 03:03:39.274
ELBOW G. B. T. Q. CAUCUSES.

03:03:39.341 --> 03:03:41.343
ASKING FOR SUPPORT FOR I TEN

03:03:41.410 --> 03:03:47.816
FILERS WITH THE ITC.

03:03:47.883 --> 03:03:49.051
ASSEMBLYMEMBER ANGLE OF THIS IS

03:03:49.118 --> 03:03:49.651
THE DATE FROM DEPARTMENT OF

03:03:49.718 --> 03:03:53.389
FINANCE- SO DEFINITELY- AS YOU

03:03:53.455 --> 03:03:55.224
MENTION WHAT THE APPROPRIATION

03:03:55.290 --> 03:03:56.792
THAT MONEY THAT THE STATE PUT

03:03:56.859 --> 03:03:59.461
FORWARD AND WHAT WE- HAVE

03:03:59.528 --> 03:04:01.196
SOMEONE PARTNERS- FOR

03:04:01.263 --> 03:04:02.931
UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS THIS

03:04:02.998 --> 03:04:04.333
IS A PRIORITY ESPECIALLY

03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:05.601
GIVING. THE GAPS THAT WOULD

03:04:05.667 --> 03:04:06.435
SEEM FROM THE FEDERAL

03:04:06.502 --> 03:04:08.170
GOVERNMENT I THINK WHEN IT

03:04:08.237 --> 03:04:09.405
COMES TO AYE TEN FIVE HOURS IN

03:04:09.471 --> 03:04:11.907
THE EITC- THAT SIMPLE HAS TO BE

03:04:11.974 --> 03:04:13.909
WEIGHED AT IN THE CONTEXT OF

03:04:13.976 --> 03:04:15.411
THE OVERALL BUDGET BECAUSE-

03:04:15.477 --> 03:04:17.246
THEY RAISE- GENERAL FUND TRADE

03:04:17.312 --> 03:04:18.480
OFF AND WE KNOW WE'RE DEALING

03:04:18.547 --> 03:04:19.681
WITH THE SIGNIFICANTLY

03:04:19.748 --> 03:04:20.582
CONSTRAINED GENERAL FUND

03:04:20.649 --> 03:04:23.018
PICTURE- AND THAT WOULD ALSO BE

03:04:23.085 --> 03:04:25.053
AN- ON GOING CHANGE. IN DATA

03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:26.488
SETS AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT

03:04:26.555 --> 03:04:28.223
THE STRUCTURE OF OUR BUDGET NOT

03:04:28.290 --> 03:04:29.758
JUST FOR THE COMING YEAR OR THE

03:04:29.825 --> 03:04:31.260
CURRENT YEAR BUT FOR SEVERAL

03:04:31.326 --> 03:04:33.228
YEARS FORRIGHT SO I THINK THE

03:04:33.295 --> 03:04:34.396
GOVERNOR STILL MAKING HIS

03:04:34.463 --> 03:04:35.798
DECISIONS ON THAT. I WOULD

03:04:35.864 --> 03:04:37.232
DEFINITELY RECEIVED THE

03:04:37.299 --> 03:04:38.500
FEEDBACK AND IT'S ON OUR RADAR

03:04:38.567 --> 03:04:40.402
SCREEN- BUT I THINK UNTIL THE

03:04:40.469 --> 03:04:41.303
GOVERNOR PUTS OUT HIS NAY

03:04:41.370 --> 03:04:44.840
REVISION. I CAN'T REALLY GET

03:04:44.907 --> 03:04:45.941
AHEAD OF HIS DECISION. IF I MAY

03:04:46.008 --> 03:04:47.242
I'M GOING TO- CHANGE THE

03:04:47.309 --> 03:04:50.312
SUBJECT AND- ADDRESS MY FINAL

03:04:50.379 --> 03:04:52.014
TWO QUESTIONS. IN TERMS OF HOW

03:04:52.080 --> 03:04:53.449
WE HELP TO STABILIZE THE

03:04:53.515 --> 03:04:55.984
MEDICAL SYSTEM. AND I WILL

03:04:56.051 --> 03:04:57.786
EDITORIALIZE AN AD THAT I AM

03:04:57.853 --> 03:04:59.621
NOT SURE THAT THE FEDERAL

03:04:59.688 --> 03:05:02.357
FUNDING IS SUFFICIENT- AND

03:05:02.424 --> 03:05:04.126
BELIEVE THAT MORE WILL BE

03:05:04.193 --> 03:05:06.161
NEEDED FOR US TO STABILIZE THE

03:05:06.228 --> 03:05:08.730
MEDICAL SYSTEM. AND I'D LIKE TO

03:05:08.797 --> 03:05:10.065
ADD ON TO MY COLLEAGUES

03:05:10.132 --> 03:05:12.267
REGARDING A REGULATION.

03:05:12.334 --> 03:05:14.303
UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT WE'VE-

03:05:14.369 --> 03:05:16.505
PASSED IT THAT MAY CAUSE

03:05:16.572 --> 03:05:18.507
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL TROUBLES

03:05:18.574 --> 03:05:21.009
FOR OUR HOSPITALS. AND I'M

03:05:21.076 --> 03:05:24.279
WONDERING IF WE CAN BECAUSE IT

03:05:24.346 --> 03:05:26.081
SEEMS THAT EVERY YEAR WE- TALK

03:05:26.148 --> 03:05:27.950
ABOUT CLOSURES OF MORE

03:05:28.016 --> 03:05:31.453
HOSPITALS AND HOW THIS- REALLY.

03:05:31.520 --> 03:05:33.455
LIMITS OUR ACCESS TO

03:05:33.522 --> 03:05:35.624
EMERGENCIES AND OTHER TYPES OF

03:05:35.691 --> 03:05:38.327
HOSPITAL CARE WHICH PLACES OUR

03:05:38.393 --> 03:05:40.996
COMMUNITIES AT RISK AND NOW

03:05:41.063 --> 03:05:43.365
IRONICALLY IT IS OUR HEALTH

03:05:43.432 --> 03:05:46.068
CARE CRISES WHICH HAS EMPTIED

03:05:46.134 --> 03:05:49.137
OUR HOSPITALS. CUTTING OFF

03:05:49.204 --> 03:05:51.106
3240% OF THEIR REVENUE AND

03:05:51.173 --> 03:05:52.774
POTENTIALLY PUTTING THEMSELVES

03:05:52.841 --> 03:05:55.310
ON LIFE SUPPORT. MY SECOND

03:05:55.377 --> 03:05:56.979
LARGEST HOSPITAL IN FRESNO

03:05:57.045 --> 03:05:59.748
COUNTY FOR LOAD A HUNDRED AND

03:05:59.815 --> 03:06:00.215
SEVENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES

03:06:00.282 --> 03:06:02.784
YESTERDAY OR SIX AND A HALF

03:06:02.851 --> 03:06:05.120
PERCENT OF THEIR ENTIRE WORK

03:06:05.187 --> 03:06:08.156
FORCE. AND SO I'D LIKE TO

03:06:08.223 --> 03:06:10.259
UNDERSTAND AND- ASK THE

03:06:10.325 --> 03:06:11.793
ADMINISTRATION IF THEY WOULD

03:06:11.860 --> 03:06:13.962
SUPPORT REVISITING THE CURRENT

03:06:14.029 --> 03:06:15.364
SEISMIC RETROFITTING

03:06:15.430 --> 03:06:17.666
REQUIREMENTS. AND DEADLINES FOR

03:06:17.733 --> 03:06:20.936
LOW RISK HOSPITALS AS A WAY TO

03:06:21.003 --> 03:06:22.404
REDUCE THE IMMENSE FISCAL

03:06:22.471 --> 03:06:24.339
PRESSURES PARTICULARLY ON A

03:06:24.406 --> 03:06:29.678

SORT OF LIKE A LIKE ADAM DORSEY.

03:06:32.814 --> 03:06:37.185
ALL YEAH SO- I THINK THAT- IT

03:06:37.252 --> 03:06:38.387
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS

03:06:38.453 --> 03:06:40.455
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE YOU KNOW

03:06:40.522 --> 03:06:42.624

VERY CLOSELY WITH THE INDUSTRY-

03:06:48.764 --> 03:06:50.799
BUT THIS IS BEEN A REAL. A

03:06:50.866 --> 03:06:52.834
PRIORITY OF OURS IN OUR

03:06:52.901 --> 03:06:54.236

TO DIG INTO MLR AND DON'T MEAN

03:08:32.801 --> 03:08:35.103
TO GET TO ONE KEY BUT- MEDICAL

03:08:35.170 --> 03:08:37.372
LOSS RATIO IS A BILL THAT WAS

03:08:37.439 --> 03:08:39.508
CHAPTER TO A FEW YEARS AGO I.

03:08:39.574 --> 03:08:41.910
BELIEVE IT WAS AB TWENTY FOUR

03:08:41.977 --> 03:08:44.379
NINETY NINE. BUT AS MANY OF YOU

03:08:44.446 --> 03:08:45.914
KNOW CERTAIN INSURANCE

03:08:45.981 --> 03:08:47.949
INDUSTRIES HAVE BEGUN RETURNING

03:08:48.016 --> 03:08:50.452
PAYMENTS TO CONSUMERS AS OUR

03:08:50.519 --> 03:08:52.454
LIFESTYLES HAVE CHANGED SUCH AS

03:08:52.521 --> 03:08:54.790
DRIVING LESS. HOWEVER THE

03:08:54.856 --> 03:08:56.725
HEALTH INSURANCE DâN THE

03:08:56.792 --> 03:08:59.227
MANAGED CARE INDUSTRY HAS YET

03:08:59.294 --> 03:09:01.630
TO DO THE SAME. AND DESPITE

03:09:01.697 --> 03:09:04.332
THAT THE PROVIDERS AND THEIR

03:09:04.399 --> 03:09:06.034
NETWORKS ARE DRAMATICALLY

03:09:06.101 --> 03:09:08.603
SEEING LESS MEDICAL CARE OR

03:09:08.670 --> 03:09:09.871
GIVING LESS MEDICAL CARE TO

03:09:09.938 --> 03:09:11.673
THEIR PATIENTS AND SO I'D LIKE

03:09:11.740 --> 03:09:13.508
TO ASK IS THE ADMINISTRATION

03:09:13.575 --> 03:09:14.710
WORKING WITH THE HEALTH

03:09:14.776 --> 03:09:16.812
INSURERS AND- MANAGED CARE

03:09:16.878 --> 03:09:18.847
PLANS TO UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT

03:09:18.914 --> 03:09:20.849
OF RESERVES WHICH ARE BUILDING

03:09:20.916 --> 03:09:22.250
UP IN THE INDUSTRY.

03:09:22.317 --> 03:09:23.852
PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT

03:09:23.919 --> 03:09:25.787
THAT THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED

03:09:25.854 --> 03:09:29.091
MEDICAL LOSS RATIO WHICH WAS

03:09:29.157 --> 03:09:31.993
ADOPTED THROUGH MY BILL. BUT

03:09:32.060 --> 03:09:33.295
ADAM DORSEY DISCUSS THIS AS

03:09:33.361 --> 03:09:38.734
WELL. ALL YOU ARE I GUESS

03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:40.202
THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT I THINK

03:09:40.268 --> 03:09:42.471
ARE IMPORTANT NODE ONE IS THAT

03:09:42.537 --> 03:09:44.473
YOU KNOW IT HEALTH PLANS ARE

03:09:44.539 --> 03:09:45.440
ARE KIND OF DIFFERENTLY

03:09:45.507 --> 03:09:47.676
SITUATED AND THERE ARE SOME

03:09:47.743 --> 03:09:49.277
HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE MAKING

03:09:49.344 --> 03:09:51.146
PAYMENTS TO- PROVIDER GROUPS

03:09:51.213 --> 03:09:53.148
AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THAT I

03:09:53.215 --> 03:09:54.850
THINK ARE HELPFUL AND- IN

03:09:54.916 --> 03:09:57.686
STABILIZING. IN HELPING TO HELP

03:09:57.753 --> 03:10:00.288
STABILIZE THE SITUATION THAT'S

03:10:00.355 --> 03:10:01.623
BEING FACED BY THE HEALTHCARE

03:10:01.690 --> 03:10:03.558
PROVIDER COMMUNITY BUT- YOU

03:10:03.625 --> 03:10:05.093
KNOW OTHERS YOU KNOW DON'T FEEL

03:10:05.160 --> 03:10:06.595
LIKE THEY'RE IN A POSITION AS

03:10:06.661 --> 03:10:08.897
EARLY AS IN THE SAME WAY- THAT

03:10:08.964 --> 03:10:11.433
BUT- WHAT I'LL SAY ABOUT MLR IS

03:10:11.500 --> 03:10:13.368
THAT- MLR IS THE LAW OF THE

03:10:13.435 --> 03:10:14.636
LAND. AND THAT THE

03:10:14.703 --> 03:10:16.304
ADMINISTRATION PLANS VERY YOU

03:10:16.371 --> 03:10:18.173
KNOW AND FORCE THEM ALL OUR-

03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:20.509
AND THAT. YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES

03:10:20.575 --> 03:10:22.677
THOSE ARE AS- YOU KNOW THINGS

03:10:22.744 --> 03:10:24.045
THAT TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS AS

03:10:24.112 --> 03:10:25.881
AND WE AUDIT DATA AND

03:10:25.947 --> 03:10:27.482
ENFORCEMENT I'M KIND OF A

03:10:27.549 --> 03:10:29.284
CRUISE ON THE BACK END BUT-

03:10:29.351 --> 03:10:31.553
BUT- THAT. YOU KNOW THE PLAN IS

03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:32.821
RIGHT NOW IS TO IMPLEMENT

03:10:32.888 --> 03:10:34.756
CURRENT LAW WHICH INCLUDES YOU

03:10:34.823 --> 03:10:35.423
KNOW MEDICAL LOSS RATIO

03:10:35.490 --> 03:10:38.360
REQUIREMENTS. AND UP IF THE

03:10:38.426 --> 03:10:39.928
AGENCY HAS ANYTHING ELSE THAT

03:10:39.995 --> 03:10:47.335
ON THAT CERTAINLY. YEAH THANK

03:10:47.402 --> 03:10:52.474
YOU HAVE. IF THERE'S NOTHING TO

03:10:52.541 --> 03:10:55.877
ADD AND- I AM PRECIADO THAT

03:10:55.944 --> 03:10:58.013
IT'S THE LAW OF THE LAND BUT I

03:10:58.079 --> 03:10:59.581
BELIEVE WE ALSO HAVE TO ENFORCE

03:10:59.648 --> 03:11:02.551
THOSE LAWS AND SO I'D LIKE TO

03:11:02.617 --> 03:11:04.753
UNDERSTAND IF THE GOVERNOR IS

03:11:04.820 --> 03:11:07.722
WILLING TO- SIGN AN EXECUTIVE

03:11:07.789 --> 03:11:10.992
ORDER TO ENSURE THAT MLR IS

03:11:11.059 --> 03:11:13.094
RESPECTED AND ENFORCED. IN

03:11:13.161 --> 03:11:15.030
ORDER FOR US TO REBUILD OUR

03:11:15.096 --> 03:11:23.605
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. SO I THINK

03:11:23.672 --> 03:11:24.673
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

03:11:24.739 --> 03:11:27.976
TAKE BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT.

03:11:28.043 --> 03:11:29.578
THANK YOU I JUST THINK IT'S

03:11:29.644 --> 03:11:32.881

03:11:32.948 --> 03:11:36.685
SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF- DECREASE.

03:11:36.751 --> 03:11:38.620
ACCESS THAT IS COME FROM COVERT

03:11:38.687 --> 03:11:42.157
NINETEEN. AND SO- WOULD WANT US

03:11:42.224 --> 03:11:44.793
TO LOOK TOWARDS TOOLS THAT- WE

03:11:44.860 --> 03:11:47.062
HAVE ESTABLISHED AND LOOK TO

03:11:47.128 --> 03:11:49.164
ENFORCE THOSE AND- BELIEVE THAT

03:11:49.231 --> 03:11:52.234
MLR IS A SIGNIFICANT WAY THAT

03:11:52.300 --> 03:11:54.169

FIND A WAY OF NOT JUST WATCHING

03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:44.185
EVERYTHING IN SIGHT BECAUSE WE

03:17:44.252 --> 03:17:45.920
ALSO EVEN AS WE APPROACH THIS

03:17:45.987 --> 03:17:47.689
VERY DIFFICULT BOTCHED SEASON.

03:17:47.755 --> 03:17:48.790
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

PROTECTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE

03:17:51.392 --> 03:17:53.328
PEOPLE. AND ALSO THINKING ABOUT

THE FUTURE AT AND MANY OF THE

03:17:54.696 --> 03:17:56.331
BEST THINGS THAT YOU MADE US

ALL INTO EXACTLY THAT CATEGORY.

03:17:57.799 --> 03:17:59.367
SO LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S NO

03:17:59.434 --> 03:18:01.102
MAGIC SOLUTION TAUGHT TO IT BUT

03:18:01.169 --> 03:18:02.036
WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERY

03:18:02.103 --> 03:18:04.372
AVAILABLE OPTION- IN TERMS OF

03:18:04.439 --> 03:18:05.573
THAT DECISIONS THAT THE

03:18:05.640 --> 03:18:07.008
GOVERNOR'S MAKING. OVER THE

03:18:07.075 --> 03:18:08.243
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS FOR HIS NAY

03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:10.044
RECREATION. AND WILL BE DOING

03:18:10.111 --> 03:18:16.351
WHAT'S ALL THE OF. OKAY

03:18:16.417 --> 03:18:17.752
ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY THIS IS

03:18:17.819 --> 03:18:18.920
OUR GATE PRODUCT THE

03:18:18.987 --> 03:18:21.389
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. AND YOUR

03:18:21.456 --> 03:18:23.258
QUESTION IS VERY WELL TAKEN I

03:18:23.324 --> 03:18:27.061
THINK- THE CHALLENGE. THAT THE

03:18:27.128 --> 03:18:28.229
STATE WILL PLACE COULD BE

03:18:28.296 --> 03:18:31.266
SIGNIFICANT AS- THE FINANCE

03:18:31.332 --> 03:18:33.001
DEPARTMENT AS INDICATED. THAT

03:18:33.067 --> 03:18:36.604
THEY THINK THAT. THE SOLUTION

03:18:36.671 --> 03:18:37.705
TO THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY

03:18:37.772 --> 03:18:40.308
WANT TO CONSIDER. THIS THE-

03:18:40.375 --> 03:18:43.344
SEVERAL LAY TO THE STORE. YOUR

03:18:43.411 --> 03:18:44.345
COMBINING THE USE OF JUDICIAL

03:18:44.412 --> 03:18:46.881
USE OF RESERVE. MAYBE ARE

03:18:46.948 --> 03:18:49.384
INTERNAL BORROWING AND THEN

03:18:49.450 --> 03:18:53.288
ALSO THERE ARE NO BUDGETARY-

03:18:53.354 --> 03:18:55.857
SHIPS OR PERHAPS THERE'S SOME

03:18:55.923 --> 03:18:57.859
SOME KIND OF DEFERRALS THAT

03:18:57.925 --> 03:18:59.794
WOULD HAVE LESS LESS OUR IMPACT

03:18:59.861 --> 03:19:01.829
ON THE OPTIONS IN ANY MATERIAL

03:19:01.896 --> 03:19:04.465
WAY SO THE COMBINATION OF THOSE

03:19:04.532 --> 03:19:07.001
AND THEN HOPEFULLY- IF THERE'S

03:19:07.068 --> 03:19:09.404
ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ASSISTANCE

03:19:09.470 --> 03:19:10.838
FORTHCOMING THEN THAT WOULD.

03:19:10.905 --> 03:19:13.608
REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM

03:19:13.675 --> 03:19:15.677
BUT I DO THINK IT SHOULD BE-

03:19:15.743 --> 03:19:17.278
RECOGNIZED FOR A MOMENT THAT

03:19:17.345 --> 03:19:19.447
THE SIZE OF THE STATE BUDGET

03:19:19.514 --> 03:19:20.982
RESERVE THAT HAS BEEN BUILT UP

03:19:21.049 --> 03:19:22.884
OVER THE EXPANSION IS REALLY A

03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:25.386
KEY ASSET FOR THE STATE AND FOR

03:19:25.453 --> 03:19:26.888
THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE AT ITS

03:19:26.954 --> 03:19:29.624
DISPOSAL AND ONCE WE HAVE A

03:19:29.691 --> 03:19:30.858
BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE BUDGET

03:19:30.925 --> 03:19:33.328
PROBLEM YEAH I THINK YOU WILL-

03:19:33.394 --> 03:19:34.996
YOU KNOW YOU. WANT TO DROP THAT

03:19:35.063 --> 03:19:37.065
DOWN THIS IS WHAT THIS IS THE

03:19:37.131 --> 03:19:39.934
RAINY DAY THAT IT WAS BUILT.

03:19:40.001 --> 03:19:41.369
MORE THAN ONE WAY THEY HOPE YOU

03:19:41.436 --> 03:19:47.375
WITH THAT OR OFFICE IS.

03:19:47.442 --> 03:19:48.443
CURRENTLY WORKING ON. DEVELOP

03:19:48.509 --> 03:19:49.811
SOME. FISCAL ESTIMATES WOULD

03:19:49.877 --> 03:19:50.945
LOOK AT JUST KIND OF GO INTO

03:19:51.012 --> 03:19:53.448
THE- JUST GO LIBERTY. YOU GO

03:19:53.514 --> 03:19:54.949
INTO WITH A SENSE OF WHAT THE

03:19:55.016 --> 03:19:57.819
BASELINE OF EXPENDITURES IS

03:19:57.885 --> 03:19:59.320
WE'RE WORKING ON SORT OF A- AN

03:19:59.387 --> 03:20:00.888
UPDATE CALLING IT OUR SPRING

03:20:00.955 --> 03:20:03.658
OUTLOOK AS OPPOSED TO OUR

03:20:03.725 --> 03:20:06.160
NOVEMBER FALLOUT. AND THAT WE

HOPE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH KIND

03:20:08.463 --> 03:20:10.798
OF A YOU KNOW EXPENDITURE BASED

03:20:10.865 --> 03:20:12.633
HIGH IN AN EXPENDITURE BASED

03:20:12.700 --> 03:20:15.603
LOW AND- THOSE WOULD BE SOME

03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:18.039
WAYS TO GIVE SOME. WAYS TO

03:20:18.106 --> 03:20:19.507
MAINTAIN CURRENT SERVICES AND

03:20:19.574 --> 03:20:22.210
RESISTING BASELINE BUDGET BUT

03:20:22.276 --> 03:20:25.380
THEN. THIRD THERE ARE MORE

03:20:25.446 --> 03:20:26.748
COSTLY INCLUDING THE LESS

03:20:26.814 --> 03:20:28.249
COSTLY WAYS TO DO THAT YOU'RE

GOING TO PRESENT THAT TO YOU AS

03:20:30.418 --> 03:20:33.888
A- SO ROUND FOR DISCUSSION- OF

03:20:33.955 --> 03:20:36.357
COURSE IT WILL BE. VERY CRUCIAL

03:20:36.424 --> 03:20:38.559
A INFORMED BY WHAT THE

03:20:38.626 --> 03:20:40.228
GOVERNMENT ARMY REVISION

03:20:40.294 --> 03:20:43.931
INCLUDES- BUT- WE HOPE THIS

03:20:43.998 --> 03:20:46.134
WILL BE A GOOD PLACE TO START.

03:20:46.200 --> 03:20:47.869
YEAH THAT AND THOSE FRANKLY ARE

03:20:47.935 --> 03:20:49.737
ARE JUST THE ANSWER IS I WAS

03:20:49.804 --> 03:20:51.239
HOPING FOR AYE AYE I WOULD NOT

03:20:51.305 --> 03:20:52.707
WANT TO HAVE OUR GOAL TO BE

03:20:52.774 --> 03:20:54.509
GETTING THE OTHER NATIONAL

03:21:01.382 --> 03:21:03.217
OF OUR COLLEAGUES BUT- WHAT CAN

03:21:03.284 --> 03:21:05.019
WE DO CREATIVELY AND LOOK AT

03:21:05.086 --> 03:21:07.355
OUR PAST RECESSIONS BUT I ALSO.

03:21:07.422 --> 03:21:09.257
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND I

03:21:09.323 --> 03:21:11.659
THINK THAT- OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL

03:21:11.726 --> 03:21:12.560
SHOULD BE TO NOT MAKE THE

03:21:12.627 --> 03:21:14.529
PROBLEM WORSE AND- CUTTING

03:21:14.595 --> 03:21:17.365
ACCESS AT HIGHER EDUCATION AND-

03:21:17.432 --> 03:21:19.600
HEALTH CARE BACKS AS CHILD CARE

PROGRAMS AFTER SCHOOL GETTING

03:21:24.372 --> 03:21:26.107
RID OF THOSE THINGS ARE NOT

03:21:26.174 --> 03:21:28.776
GOING TO MAKE THE SITUATION. A

03:21:28.843 --> 03:21:31.546
YEAH SO I. ASK NOW QUESTIONS

OKAY THANK YOU TWO TWO MORE

03:23:59.927 --> 03:24:02.530

03:24:08.569 --> 03:24:10.271
INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

PROGRAMS AND I GUESS THE

03:24:18.145 --> 03:24:20.081
QUESTION THAT WE ASK FOR BUDGET

03:24:20.147 --> 03:24:22.049
PEOPLE IS. HOW DO WE MAKE THESE

03:24:22.116 --> 03:24:24.418
PENCIL OUT FOR THIS FOR IT WITH

03:24:24.485 --> 03:24:26.887
STATE RESOURCE IS EMPLOYERS

03:24:26.954 --> 03:24:28.556
HAVING THEIR CONTRIBUTION THEIR

03:24:28.623 --> 03:24:30.625
SHARE AND POTENTIAL FEDERAL

03:24:30.691 --> 03:24:31.726
MONEY BUT THE REAL QUESTION

03:24:31.792 --> 03:24:33.160
FRANKLY PEOPLE ACROSS

03:24:33.227 --> 03:24:35.196

IT'S PAID FOR THIS TO MAKE SURE

03:24:37.698 --> 03:24:39.867
THAT IT'S AVAILABLE SO. ARE WE

03:24:39.934 --> 03:24:42.103
CERTAIN THAT IT'LL BE RELIABLE.

03:24:42.169 --> 03:24:44.271
TWO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA FOR

03:24:44.338 --> 03:24:45.940
THE DURATION OF THIS CO IN

03:24:46.007 --> 03:24:51.412
NINETEEN CRISIS. YES WHEN IT

03:24:51.479 --> 03:24:53.247
COMES TO THE- STATE

03:24:53.314 --> 03:24:55.516
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS- I KNOW

03:24:55.583 --> 03:24:56.517
THIS CAME UP AS YOU MENTIONED

03:24:56.584 --> 03:24:58.219
BRIEFLY EARLIER WE ARE REALLY

03:24:58.285 --> 03:25:00.187
DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO

03:25:00.254 --> 03:25:00.921
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BENEFITS

03:25:00.988 --> 03:25:03.090
GET OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND

03:25:03.157 --> 03:25:04.025
THAT'S ALSO TRUE FOR THE

03:25:04.091 --> 03:25:05.660
FEDERAL BENEFITS BECAUSE A LOT

03:25:05.726 --> 03:25:07.028
OF THOSE YOU KNOW TEND TO FLOW

03:25:07.094 --> 03:25:08.496
THROUGH THE STATE SO FOR

03:25:08.562 --> 03:25:09.964
EXAMPLE THAT SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR

03:25:10.031 --> 03:25:12.733
BOOST- THAT YOU DE IS ALSO AND

03:25:12.800 --> 03:25:14.168
WEBER AGENCIES MAKING SURE THAT

03:25:14.235 --> 03:25:15.970
THOSE PAYMENTS AS WELL. ARE

03:25:16.037 --> 03:25:17.672
GOING OUT FOR A SYSTEM AS SOON

03:25:17.738 --> 03:25:19.273
AS POSSIBLE I THINK ONE OF THE

03:25:19.340 --> 03:25:20.708
CHALLENGES WILL BE WE TALKED

03:25:20.775 --> 03:25:22.410
ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH.

03:25:22.476 --> 03:25:24.578
FEDERAL SUPPORT IN MAKING SURE

03:25:24.645 --> 03:25:26.514
THAT IT'S NOT GOING IN THAT THE

03:25:26.580 --> 03:25:28.349
ALONE SEPARATE CHECKING OUT AT

03:25:28.416 --> 03:25:29.617
THE INTEREST COST IS NOT

03:25:29.684 --> 03:25:31.686
FALLING DISPROPORTIONATELY ON

03:25:31.752 --> 03:25:32.887
US GIVEN THE HISTORIC

03:25:32.953 --> 03:25:33.921
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE AND I

03:25:33.988 --> 03:25:35.356
THINK YOU'RE ALSO SEEING FOR

03:25:35.423 --> 03:25:36.524
EXAMPLE WHAT THE SIX HUNDRED

03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:38.092
DOLLAR PAYMENT- THAT SOME OF

03:25:38.159 --> 03:25:39.660
THAT WILL BE ENDING THIS SUMMER

03:25:39.727 --> 03:25:41.529
AT THE END OF JULY. AND SO WHAT

03:25:41.595 --> 03:25:43.998
NOBODY CAN SAY FOR SURE- WHERE

03:25:44.065 --> 03:25:45.433
WE WILL BE WITH THIS PUBLIC

03:25:45.499 --> 03:25:47.101
HEALTH CRISIS SO SEATED

03:25:47.168 --> 03:25:49.704
ECONOMIC IMPACT BY JULY I THINK

03:25:49.770 --> 03:25:52.406
IT'S A PRETTY STATE BET. THE

03:25:52.473 --> 03:25:59.013
IMPACT OF THE CRISIS BE. IT'S A

03:25:59.080 --> 03:26:01.315
FOR SURE SO EASY DAY AND WEBER

03:26:01.382 --> 03:26:02.483
AGENCY AT THE ADMINISTRATION

03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:03.851
ARE ALL FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE

03:26:03.918 --> 03:26:05.252
THAT WHETHER IT'S OUR COMPUTER

03:26:05.319 --> 03:26:07.621
SYSTEMS OR CALL CENTERS AT THE

03:26:07.688 --> 03:26:08.889
MONEY'S GETTING OUT AS QUICKLY

03:26:08.956 --> 03:26:10.458
AS POSSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO

03:26:10.524 --> 03:26:11.692
NEED IT I THINK YOU SAW THAT

03:26:11.759 --> 03:26:13.360
EVEN IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.

03:26:13.427 --> 03:26:15.262
WITH RELAXING SO THE CATION

03:26:15.329 --> 03:26:16.297
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE

03:26:16.363 --> 03:26:17.798
TRADITIONALLY REQUIRED AND I

03:26:17.865 --> 03:26:19.633
THINK THE TWO OTHER THINGS THAT

03:26:19.700 --> 03:26:20.367
WE'RE GONNA BE DOINGIS NUMBER

03:26:20.434 --> 03:26:22.870
ONE. IN TO ENGAGE WITH OUR

03:26:22.937 --> 03:26:24.305
FEDERAL PARTNERS TO MAKING SURE

03:26:24.371 --> 03:26:25.906

pOF THIS CALENDAR YEAR AT THAT

03:26:29.844 --> 03:26:32.646
AGE IS FORTHCOMING AND THEN TO.

03:26:32.713 --> 03:26:35.916
EVEN AS WE ARE TRYING TO. HAVE

OUR LEGACY SYSTEMS YES IT OUT

03:26:37.785 --> 03:26:39.086
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THINKING

03:26:39.153 --> 03:26:40.888
THROUGH- WITH ALL THE EXPERTISE

03:26:40.955 --> 03:26:42.590
WE CAN BRING TO BEAR ON HOW WE

03:26:42.656 --> 03:26:43.858
CAN IMPROVE OUR SYSTEMS AND I

03:26:43.924 --> 03:26:46.160
THINK. JULIE SU AD IS MENTIONED

03:26:46.227 --> 03:26:47.394
LAST WEEK AT ANSWERED SOME

03:26:47.461 --> 03:26:48.929
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT ON HOW

03:26:48.996 --> 03:26:49.897
WE'RE TRYING TO BRING EVERY

03:26:49.964 --> 03:26:51.298
SINGLE RESOURCE TO BEAR SO.

03:26:51.365 --> 03:26:52.833
THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY WE

03:26:52.900 --> 03:26:54.401
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY AS YOU PUT

03:26:54.468 --> 03:26:55.569
IT BACK. FOLKS DON'T REALLY

03:26:55.636 --> 03:26:57.004
CARE WHO'S PAYING FOR IT WHERE

03:26:57.071 --> 03:26:58.539

JUST ONE NOW THAT THEY HAVE IT

03:27:00.341 --> 03:27:02.209
WHEN THEY NEED IT SO THAT IS A

03:27:02.276 --> 03:27:02.977
PRIORITY FOR THE- AND SO YOU

03:27:03.043 --> 03:27:04.278
MENTIONED. YOU WHY BUT THAT THE

03:27:04.345 --> 03:27:05.679
SECOND PART OF MY QUESTION WAS

WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON A

03:27:21.929 --> 03:27:23.197
REVISION BUT WE UNDERSTAND

03:27:23.264 --> 03:27:24.832
THOSE PROGRAMS ARE. CRITICAL AS

03:27:24.899 --> 03:27:28.936
WELL. YES AND THEN MY FINAL

03:27:29.003 --> 03:27:30.938
QUESTION IS RELATE TO WORKERS

03:27:31.005 --> 03:27:34.809
COMPENSATION. AND OF COURSE

03:27:34.875 --> 03:27:36.443
THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY NOW

03:27:36.510 --> 03:27:38.979
WITH CLAIMS WITH COVERT CLAIMS

03:27:39.046 --> 03:27:41.015

03:27:41.081 --> 03:27:43.150
WILL BE- ADDRESS I KNOWS MY

03:27:45.853 --> 03:27:47.421
LEGISLATION WHICH SIDE SUPPORT

03:27:47.488 --> 03:27:48.823
ON THIS TO MAKE SURE WE CAN

03:27:48.889 --> 03:27:51.258
PROTECT OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS

03:27:51.325 --> 03:27:52.693
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.

03:27:52.760 --> 03:27:54.361
WITHIN THE MINISTRATIONS FAR AS

03:27:54.428 --> 03:27:56.931
PEOPLE- BEING DENIED WORKERS

03:27:56.997 --> 03:28:01.535
COMP CLAIMS THAT HAS- COVERT

03:28:01.602 --> 03:28:03.571
NINETEEN. IMPACT IN TO MAKE

03:28:03.637 --> 03:28:05.239

03:28:08.209 --> 03:28:11.912
BENEFITS THAT THEY DESERVE. SO

03:28:11.979 --> 03:28:13.814
ANY ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO-

03:28:13.881 --> 03:28:15.182
THE SPECIFICS OF PEOPLE BEING

03:28:15.249 --> 03:28:16.817
DENIED WHICH IT MIGHT CLAIMS

03:28:16.884 --> 03:28:18.385
YOU KNOW DEFINITELY BRING THEM

03:28:18.452 --> 03:28:19.253
TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND

BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IN THIS

03:28:21.288 --> 03:28:23.290
EMERGENCY AT THOSE CLAIMS NEED

03:28:23.357 --> 03:28:24.825
TO BE ADJUDICATED. FAIRLY

03:28:24.892 --> 03:28:25.960
OBVIOUS ON THAT I KNOW THERE'S

03:28:26.026 --> 03:28:27.094
BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION OF

03:28:27.161 --> 03:28:28.696
WORKERS COMPENSATION MORE

03:28:28.762 --> 03:28:29.763
GENERALLY AND I KNOW YOU

03:28:29.830 --> 03:28:31.232
MENTIONED A LEGISLATION THE

03:28:31.298 --> 03:28:32.833
GOVERNOR HASN'T WEIGHED IN ON

03:28:32.900 --> 03:28:34.201
THAT YES I WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:28:34.268 --> 03:28:36.804
THAT WE HAD DEAL OUT. I DO NOT

03:28:36.871 --> 03:28:39.907
GONNA HAS. THANK YOU HAS MY

03:28:39.974 --> 03:28:41.876
FINAL QUESTION THE STRUCTURE.

03:28:41.942 --> 03:28:44.578
THANK YOU MISTER BUSH. THANK

03:28:44.645 --> 03:28:49.450
YOU MISTER CHAIR. I TOOK NOTE

03:28:49.516 --> 03:28:50.985
TO I THINK IT WAS YESTERDAY-

03:28:51.051 --> 03:28:56.557
TIM COOK THE CEO OF APPLE- GAVE

03:28:56.624 --> 03:28:59.260
HIS OPINION- TO THE PRESIDENT

03:28:59.326 --> 03:29:01.862
THAT- HE FELT WE WERE GOING TO

03:29:01.929 --> 03:29:03.964
BE IN A WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A

03:29:04.031 --> 03:29:06.033
V. SHAPED ECONOMY WHICH WAS

03:29:06.100 --> 03:29:08.435
CHARACTERIZED BY A VERY RAPID

03:29:08.502 --> 03:29:11.005
DECLINE. AND THEN HE FELT-

03:29:11.071 --> 03:29:12.473
THERE WOULD BE A RAPID

03:29:12.539 --> 03:29:14.408
IMPROVEMENT AND IN THE ECONOMY

03:29:14.475 --> 03:29:16.911
AND I THINK THAT AT THAT'S AN

03:29:16.977 --> 03:29:19.146
OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF WHERE WE

03:29:19.213 --> 03:29:21.248
MIGHT BE HEADED- BUT I THINK

03:29:21.315 --> 03:29:23.017
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECONOMY

03:29:23.083 --> 03:29:25.252
THAT WE HAD ARE GOING TO RETURN

03:29:25.319 --> 03:29:26.987
AND TO AND THERE IS SOME

03:29:27.054 --> 03:29:30.024
REASON. FOR OPTIMISM. I THINK

03:29:30.090 --> 03:29:32.626
IT'S WORTHY OF US TO BE

03:29:32.693 --> 03:29:34.428
THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE OUR

03:29:34.495 --> 03:29:38.132
GOALS ARE- FOR THE FUTURE WHEN

03:29:38.198 --> 03:29:42.536
THE ECONOMY DOES RETURN. AND I

03:29:42.603 --> 03:29:45.005
WAS HEARTENED WHEN- I BELIEVE

03:29:45.072 --> 03:29:46.540
IT WAS THE ADMINISTRATION-

03:29:46.607 --> 03:29:50.644
MENTIONED TO- THE- APARTMENT

03:29:50.711 --> 03:29:51.779
FINANCE MENTIONED THAT

03:29:51.845 --> 03:29:53.113
PROTECTING VULNERABLE

03:29:53.180 --> 03:29:55.482
COMMUNITIES WOULD BE A UP A

03:29:55.549 --> 03:29:58.819
PRIORITY. AND I AGREE I THINK

03:29:58.886 --> 03:30:01.388
THAT SHOULD BE A OF A PRIORITY-

03:30:01.455 --> 03:30:03.357
I THINK ANOTHER PRIORITY OUGHT

03:30:03.424 --> 03:30:05.392
TO BE PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH

03:30:05.459 --> 03:30:08.062
AND IMPROVING OUR BEST BENSON

03:30:08.128 --> 03:30:09.630
HOW WE PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH

03:30:09.697 --> 03:30:13.801
AND MY COLLEAGUES HAVE. HAVE

03:30:13.867 --> 03:30:16.937
MENTIONED THE NEED TO INCREASE-

03:30:17.004 --> 03:30:18.339
AND TAKE STEPS TO INCREASE THE

03:30:18.405 --> 03:30:19.974
NUMBER OF DOCTORS AND NURSES

03:30:20.040 --> 03:30:20.674
AND ALLIED HEALTH CARE

03:30:20.741 --> 03:30:22.409
PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE OUT

03:30:22.476 --> 03:30:24.745
THERE ARE NO. OF MY COLLEAGUE

03:30:24.812 --> 03:30:27.147
FROM A MODESTO IS INTERESTED IN

03:30:27.214 --> 03:30:30.784
INCREASING- THE AVAILABILITY OF

03:30:30.851 --> 03:30:32.353
NURSING THROUGH A PROGRAMS

03:30:32.419 --> 03:30:35.923
THAT- I THINK IT'S AT MERCED.

03:30:35.990 --> 03:30:37.358
I'M AND I THINK I THINKTHESE

03:30:37.424 --> 03:30:39.426
ARE VERY VALUABLE GOALS BUT

03:30:39.493 --> 03:30:42.830
WHAT- I THINK IS OF UTMOST

03:30:42.896 --> 03:30:46.700
IMPORTANCE AND WHAT IS- REALLY

03:30:46.767 --> 03:30:48.669
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE

03:30:48.736 --> 03:30:52.039
LEARNED FROM. THE PANDEMIC THAT

03:30:52.106 --> 03:30:54.308
WERE INVOLVED IN IS THAT WE

03:30:54.375 --> 03:30:58.512
HAVE TO INCREASE OUR EFFORTS ON

03:30:58.579 --> 03:31:03.017
THE PREVENTION SIDE OF. THE

03:31:03.083 --> 03:31:05.085
WE'VE GOTTEN VERY GOOD AT

03:31:05.152 --> 03:31:08.389
TREATING DISEASE- BUT WE HAVE

03:31:08.455 --> 03:31:13.093
REALLY LEFT BEHIND EFFORTS TO-

03:31:13.160 --> 03:31:14.328
A TO PREVENT DISEASE FROM

03:31:14.395 --> 03:31:15.696
HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE

03:31:15.763 --> 03:31:22.469
AND THAT IS PLAYING OUT OF WITH.

03:31:22.536 --> 03:31:24.371
A TRULY DEVASTATING RESULTS

03:31:24.438 --> 03:31:25.906
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY

03:31:25.973 --> 03:31:28.642
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TODAY. HOW

03:31:28.709 --> 03:31:31.045
MINUTES EVERYTHING FROM OUR-

03:31:31.111 --> 03:31:34.815
LACK OF PREPARATION WITH- NOT

03:31:34.882 --> 03:31:39.586
STOCKPILING PP- VENTILATORS

03:31:39.653 --> 03:31:44.158
OTHER ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT. I TO

03:31:44.224 --> 03:31:47.428
A LACK OF FOCUS ON- MANY OF

03:31:47.494 --> 03:31:51.465
THE- FACTORS THAT ARE MAKING A

03:31:51.532 --> 03:31:52.566
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A

03:31:52.633 --> 03:31:54.268
DIFFICULT SITUATION UNDER ANY

03:31:54.334 --> 03:31:56.103
CIRCUMSTANCE BUT ARE MAKING IT

03:31:56.170 --> 03:32:01.175
WORSE NAMELY- THE FACT THAT WE

03:32:01.241 --> 03:32:04.445
HAVE ALLOWED A CRISIS OF- AN

03:32:04.511 --> 03:32:07.748
EPIDEMIC OF OBESITY AND TO-

03:32:07.815 --> 03:32:09.983
DIABETES AND OTHER CO OCCURRING

03:32:10.050 --> 03:32:12.553
DISORDERS. TO FASTER FOR MANY

03:32:12.619 --> 03:32:16.890
MANY YEARS SO- I WOULD LIKE TO

03:32:16.957 --> 03:32:18.525
SUGGEST THAT THAT BE ONE OF OUR

03:32:18.592 --> 03:32:20.394
PRIORITIES GOING FORWARD I'M

03:32:20.461 --> 03:32:23.897
WONDERING IF- ANY OF THREE. OUR

03:32:23.964 --> 03:32:25.332
FOLKS HERE HAVE BEEN VERY

03:32:25.399 --> 03:32:27.634
PATIENT AND HAVE STUCK IT OUT

03:32:27.701 --> 03:32:31.638
UNTIL NOW- IF- IF YOU HAVE ANY

03:32:31.705 --> 03:32:36.009
COMMENTS IN THAT REGARD. NUMBER

03:32:36.076 --> 03:32:37.778
ONE THIS IS A MISS WON OUT AND

03:32:37.845 --> 03:32:40.180
I THINK- YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY

03:32:40.247 --> 03:32:41.849
CORRECT THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC

03:32:41.915 --> 03:32:43.951
HEALTH EMERGENCY AND THAT.

03:32:44.017 --> 03:32:45.652
TREATMENT IS NOT NOT SAID THERE

03:32:45.719 --> 03:32:46.787
REALLY NEEDS TO BE A FOCUS ON

03:32:46.854 --> 03:32:48.889
PREVENTION I THINK IN THE

03:32:48.956 --> 03:32:51.024
GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET I HE

03:32:51.091 --> 03:32:51.992
REALLY PUT OUT A NUMBER

03:32:52.059 --> 03:32:54.027
PROPOSAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:32:54.094 --> 03:32:55.195
WHAT BECOMES OF THE GOALS OF

03:32:55.262 --> 03:32:56.930
THE OBJECTIVES OF. HOW WE

03:32:56.997 --> 03:32:58.832
DELIVER CARE HEALTHCARE THAT IS

03:32:58.899 --> 03:33:00.534
FOCUSES ON THE WHOLE PERSON AND

03:33:00.601 --> 03:33:02.369
FOCUSES ON ALL THE DRIVERS ARE

03:33:02.436 --> 03:33:03.904
THAT CREATE PUBLIC HEALTH

03:33:03.971 --> 03:33:05.806
CHALLENGES AND NOT SIMPLY

03:33:05.873 --> 03:33:09.476
DELIVERING. TREAT CERTAINLY.

03:33:09.543 --> 03:33:10.377
ALLEN'S NOW I WE ARE GOING FOR

03:33:10.444 --> 03:33:11.845
OUR HELPING HUMANS ADD BUDGET

03:33:11.912 --> 03:33:13.714
THIS WEEKEND. AS WE PREPARE FOR

03:33:13.780 --> 03:33:15.149
THE NAY REVISION. YOU KNOW

03:33:15.215 --> 03:33:15.983
WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT GONNA BE

03:33:16.049 --> 03:33:17.084
ABLE TO MAKE ALL THE

03:33:17.151 --> 03:33:18.152
INVESTMENTS THAT WE HAD

03:33:18.218 --> 03:33:20.287
ANTICIPATED IN JANUARY. AND

03:33:20.354 --> 03:33:20.921
THAT'S GONNA BE TOPS YOU KNOW

03:33:20.988 --> 03:33:22.356
AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT WE'RE

03:33:22.422 --> 03:33:23.790
EXPERIENCING A CRISIS THAT

03:33:23.857 --> 03:33:25.359
SHOWS. JUST HOW MUCH THOSE

03:33:25.425 --> 03:33:27.060
INVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED BUT I

03:33:27.127 --> 03:33:28.495
THINK THAT OBJECTIVE AND THAT

03:33:28.562 --> 03:33:30.097
FRAME IS STILL THERE WILL NOT

03:33:30.164 --> 03:33:31.665
ONLY ABOUT PROTECT THE MOST

03:33:31.732 --> 03:33:33.033
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. BUT

03:33:33.100 --> 03:33:34.768
DELIVERING SERVICES TO THAT AND%

03:33:34.835 --> 03:33:36.637
IN A WAY WHERE WE ARE GETTING

03:33:36.703 --> 03:33:38.172

RETURNING TO WORK- WE HAVE TO

03:33:59.826 --> 03:34:01.094
RAMP BUT I THINK IT'S A

03:34:01.161 --> 03:34:02.729
GENERALLY ACCEPTED TODAY THAT

03:34:02.796 --> 03:34:04.898

AND TO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE

03:34:09.870 --> 03:34:14.641
THE FACT THAT- THE- OVER SOME.

03:34:14.708 --> 03:34:17.945
OF OUR OF OUR TESTING PROGRAMS-

03:34:18.011 --> 03:34:21.615
SEEMS TO BE. THE WHELP OVERSIZE

03:34:21.682 --> 03:34:23.750
NOT THE WORD RIGHT WORD THAT

03:34:23.817 --> 03:34:26.353
ARE- THAT OUR PROGRAM AND OUR

03:34:26.420 --> 03:34:27.588
PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH TO

03:34:27.654 --> 03:34:30.057
INCREASING WE- ACCESS TO

03:34:30.123 --> 03:34:32.726
TESTING SEEMS TO BE WORKING AND

03:34:32.793 --> 03:34:36.296
THE- AS OF LAST WEEK I THINK

03:34:36.363 --> 03:34:38.065
WE'RE AT SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

03:34:38.131 --> 03:34:40.000
THOUSAND TESTS- OKAY A LITTLE

03:34:40.067 --> 03:34:41.602
BIT AHEAD OF SCHEDULE FULL TO

03:34:41.668 --> 03:34:44.571
THE ANTICIPATED. A TWENTY FIVE

03:34:44.638 --> 03:34:46.306
THOUSAND PER DAY- THE TO WERE

03:34:46.373 --> 03:34:47.608
EXPECTING AT THE BEGINNING OF

03:34:47.674 --> 03:34:49.209
THE MNTH REALLY AT THE VERY

03:34:49.276 --> 03:34:53.313
END OF THIS WEEK. I'M BUT I'M A

03:34:53.380 --> 03:34:55.015
LITTLE BIT PERPLEXED AND

03:34:55.082 --> 03:34:57.317
DISAPPOINTED THAT WE ARE NOT AT

03:34:57.384 --> 03:34:59.720
THIS POINT FIVE DAYS BEFORE-

03:34:59.786 --> 03:35:01.188
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A TWENTY

03:35:01.255 --> 03:35:03.223
FIVE THOUSAND. THAT WE DON'T

03:35:03.290 --> 03:35:08.495
HAVE A AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW

03:35:08.562 --> 03:35:10.230
THOSE GUYS ARE GOING TO WRAP UP

03:35:10.297 --> 03:35:12.666
BEYOND THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

03:35:12.733 --> 03:35:14.635
AND TO THAT TO ME IS OF

03:35:14.701 --> 03:35:15.369
CRITICAL IMPORTANCE BECAUSE I

03:35:15.435 --> 03:35:18.405
THINK- THE- NUMBER OF TESTS

03:35:18.472 --> 03:35:20.474
THAT ARE REQUIRED. THROUGHOUT

03:35:20.540 --> 03:35:22.476
THE STATORS SOMEWHERE IN THE

03:35:22.542 --> 03:35:23.777
NEIGHBORHOOD OF- BEWEEN SIXTY

03:35:23.844 --> 03:35:25.545
AND EIGHTY THOUSAND IF I RECALL

03:35:25.612 --> 03:35:26.947
CORRECTLY AND WE'RE STILL A

03:35:27.014 --> 03:35:28.849
LONG WAY FOR OUT SO IS THERE

03:35:28.915 --> 03:35:30.384
ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT

03:35:30.450 --> 03:35:34.187
CAN BE- PROVIDED. AS TO WHERE

03:35:34.254 --> 03:35:36.189
WE ARE ON TESTING AND THAT'LL

03:35:36.256 --> 03:35:37.524
HAVE FOLLOW UP QUESTION OF

03:35:37.591 --> 03:35:40.861
ABOUT TO CONTACT GRAYSON.

03:35:40.927 --> 03:35:42.095
ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS MONICA

03:35:42.162 --> 03:35:43.430
MEETS WITH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

03:35:43.497 --> 03:35:46.266
SERVICES AGENCIES SO EAT RIGHT

03:35:46.333 --> 03:35:48.368
YOU'RE CORRECT WE ARE ON OUR

03:35:48.435 --> 03:35:50.437
WAY TO GET TO THE TWENTY FIVE

03:35:50.504 --> 03:35:51.305
THOUSAND MARK BY THE END OF THE

03:35:51.371 --> 03:35:52.205
WEEK OR BY THE END OF THE

03:35:52.272 --> 03:35:54.841
MONTH. I AND AS SECRETARY IN

03:35:54.908 --> 03:35:57.844
THE GOVERNOR AND NOTED- IT LAST

03:35:57.911 --> 03:35:59.646
WEEK OUR GOAL IS TO GET TO

03:35:59.713 --> 03:36:00.647
ANOTHER SIXTY TO EIGHTY

03:36:00.714 --> 03:36:03.450
THOUSAND- PER DAY AND MOVING

03:36:03.517 --> 03:36:05.686
FORWARD. AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE

03:36:05.752 --> 03:36:08.388
POCKETS OF WORK- THAT I THINK

03:36:08.455 --> 03:36:09.589
ARE IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT

03:36:09.656 --> 03:36:11.425
ASTOR MINOR STRATEGY IS YEAH.

03:36:11.491 --> 03:36:13.393
WELL RIGHT THE FIRST ONE IS

03:36:13.460 --> 03:36:16.830
REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE-

03:36:16.897 --> 03:36:20.000
ARE CAPACITY- BY WRITING ONLINE

03:36:20.067 --> 03:36:22.502
HIGH. RIGHT I TESTING SITE SO

03:36:22.569 --> 03:36:24.805
THESE ARE PLACES WHERE YOU

03:36:24.871 --> 03:36:26.707
COULD DO A LOT OF TESTING ALL

03:36:26.773 --> 03:36:29.843
UP ONE ASK THAT UNIVERSITY OF

03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:31.345
CALIFORNIA SYSTEMS OBVIOUSLY

03:36:31.411 --> 03:36:38.385
HAVE A LOT. AB OUR COMMERCIAL

03:36:38.452 --> 03:36:40.120
PLANES I HAVE LAW LEVER WE ARE

03:36:40.187 --> 03:36:41.021
ACT WORKING WITH ALL OF THE

03:36:41.088 --> 03:36:42.989
STATE THINK ABOUT I'M ADDED

03:36:43.056 --> 03:36:44.791
CAPACITY THE SPACE THAT WE

03:36:44.858 --> 03:36:46.393
COULD DO A LOT OF MORE HIGH

03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:48.395
THROUGH PROTESTING I SO IT'S

03:36:48.462 --> 03:36:49.930
NOT ONE OR TWO TESTS DURING

03:36:49.996 --> 03:36:51.698
THEIR BUT- HUNDREDS OR

03:36:51.765 --> 03:36:53.967
THOUSANDS OF TEST A IN ORDER

03:36:54.034 --> 03:36:55.202
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BE FROM

03:36:55.268 --> 03:36:58.939
OUR CITY SO THAT'S ONE. THIS

03:36:59.005 --> 03:37:00.474
LINE ABOUT. IS REALLY THINKING

03:37:00.540 --> 03:37:01.875
ABOUT DO WE STRATEGICALLY

03:37:01.942 --> 03:37:04.478
DEPLOYED POINT OF CARE I TASK

03:37:04.544 --> 03:37:06.279
AND THESE ARE TESTS PRIMARILY

03:37:06.346 --> 03:37:08.215
DONE IN HEALTH CARE DELIVERY

03:37:08.281 --> 03:37:10.083
SETTINGS- AND THEY ARE LOW

03:37:10.150 --> 03:37:13.120
VOLUME BY FAX TEST. IN ORDER

03:37:13.186 --> 03:37:16.256
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO- USE THAT

03:37:16.323 --> 03:37:18.258
INFORMATION FROM A CLINICAL

03:37:18.325 --> 03:37:19.259
PERSPECTIVE IN ORDER TO MAKE

03:37:19.326 --> 03:37:21.128
DECISIONS AROUND. WITH AN

03:37:21.194 --> 03:37:23.096
INDIVIDUAL POSITIVE EFFECT

03:37:23.163 --> 03:37:25.565
EXAMPLE. IS SKILLED NURSING

03:37:25.632 --> 03:37:27.334
FACILITIES IF WE CAN QUICKLY

03:37:27.401 --> 03:37:29.336
CAST SOMEBODY AND DETERMINED

03:37:29.403 --> 03:37:30.904
THAT THEY ARE POSITIVE OR

03:37:30.971 --> 03:37:32.806
NEGATIVE IF THEY'RE POSITIVE

03:37:32.873 --> 03:37:34.274
THEN WE CAN MOVE QUICKLY AROUND

03:37:34.341 --> 03:37:35.942
MITIGATION TO ISOLATE THAT

03:37:36.009 --> 03:37:37.844
INDIVIDUAL WITHIN OUR FACILITY.

03:37:37.911 --> 03:37:39.379
SO THAT THEY ARE NOT EXPOSED

03:37:39.446 --> 03:37:41.615
QUICKER SO OUR ABILITY TO

03:37:41.681 --> 03:37:43.750
DEPLOY THESE POINT OF CARE TASK

03:37:43.817 --> 03:37:45.152
IS REALLY IMPORTANT

03:37:45.218 --> 03:37:48.221
PARTICULARLY IN RURAL PARTS OF

03:37:48.288 --> 03:37:50.624
THE STATE AS WELL AS- PARTS OF

03:37:50.690 --> 03:37:51.591
THE STATE WHERE WE HAVE HIGH

03:37:51.658 --> 03:37:53.026
VOLUMES ARE STILL NURSING

03:37:53.093 --> 03:37:54.995
FACILITY OR CONGREGATE CARE. I

03:37:55.061 --> 03:37:56.596
SETTINGS FOR LONG TERM CARE ON

03:37:56.663 --> 03:37:58.398
THE LONG TERM CARE SIDE THE

03:37:58.465 --> 03:38:00.100
REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE

03:38:00.167 --> 03:38:02.669
AND OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT. THE

03:38:02.736 --> 03:38:05.672
THIRD LINE OF EFFORT IS REALLY

03:38:05.739 --> 03:38:10.811
AROUND THE SEROLOGY. TASK AB

03:38:10.877 --> 03:38:11.945
OBVIOUSLY HAS ITS- CAST THAT WE

03:38:12.012 --> 03:38:13.146

STANFORD TO GET THIS WRONG

03:38:20.020 --> 03:38:21.855
WOULD YOU TEST- ON THEIR END AS

03:38:21.922 --> 03:38:24.024
WELL AND A SEROLOGY TEST IS

03:38:24.090 --> 03:38:26.159
DIFFERENT FROM MY PCR TEST IN

03:38:26.226 --> 03:38:27.127
THE SENSE THAT IT REALLY LOOKS

03:38:27.194 --> 03:38:28.528
AT THE ANTI BODIES AND THE-

03:38:28.595 --> 03:38:30.831
LIVE- ACTED TO SEE WHETHER OR

03:38:30.897 --> 03:38:33.200
NOT YOU BUILD. IMMUNITY I FOR A

03:38:33.266 --> 03:38:35.068
PARTICULAR VIRUS AND THAT IS

03:38:35.135 --> 03:38:37.304
GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. TO US AS

03:38:37.370 --> 03:38:38.738
WE LOOK AT MORE COMMUNITY

TESTS OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY

03:38:46.046 --> 03:38:47.747
SO. THAT WE CAN IMPROPER

03:38:47.814 --> 03:38:49.683
ABILITY TO TEST MORE BROADLY

03:38:49.749 --> 03:38:51.718
AND THEN RELEASED THE FORT LINE

03:38:51.785 --> 03:38:53.587
OF EFFORT OR THE FOURTH POCKET.

03:38:53.653 --> 03:38:55.689
IS WHAT I WILL CALL LOOKING AT

03:38:55.755 --> 03:38:57.390
THESE TESTING DESERT SO REALLY

03:38:57.457 --> 03:38:59.426

OUR STRATEGY IS HAS FOUR

03:40:00.754 --> 03:40:02.255

03:40:33.053 --> 03:40:34.854
ARE THE EFFORTS THAT ARE UNDER

03:40:34.921 --> 03:40:36.990

WHERE WE ARE ALL ON TESTING.

03:40:58.545 --> 03:41:01.448
THE ONE THE ONE THING- THAT I

03:41:01.514 --> 03:41:03.316

PRESENTED A LOT OF- AND THAT

03:41:15.428 --> 03:41:17.731
INFORMATION AND MORE- I WAS

03:41:17.797 --> 03:41:19.366
VERY VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE

03:41:19.432 --> 03:41:22.602
DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE- AND ALSO

03:41:22.669 --> 03:41:23.970
CAME AWAY WITH AN UNDERSTANDING

03:41:24.037 --> 03:41:26.439
OF JUST HOW COMPLEX THIS ISSUE

03:41:26.506 --> 03:41:29.109
AS- A BUT THE MAIN THRUST OF MY

03:41:29.175 --> 03:41:31.111
QUESTION WAS WHETHER WE WERE

03:41:31.177 --> 03:41:33.246
POSITION TO PROJECT WITH ANY

03:41:33.313 --> 03:41:36.549
DEGREE OF CERTAINTY- WHEN WILL

03:41:36.616 --> 03:41:38.985
BE ABLE TO ACT AS WE DID A

03:41:39.052 --> 03:41:40.420
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND SAYING

03:41:40.487 --> 03:41:41.655
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WRAP UP TO

03:41:41.721 --> 03:41:43.289
TWENTY. FIVE THOUSAND TODAY

03:41:43.356 --> 03:41:48.261
WHEN WE WOULD BE TO- OF MOVE

03:41:48.328 --> 03:41:49.629
THAT GOAL POSTS TO THIRTY

03:41:49.696 --> 03:41:50.730
THOUSAND AND THIRTY FIVE IN FOR

03:41:50.797 --> 03:41:52.732
SO LONG SO FORTH AND IT APPEARS

03:41:52.799 --> 03:41:54.734
TO ME THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

03:41:54.801 --> 03:41:55.902
THINGS THAT NEED TO FALL INTO

03:41:55.969 --> 03:41:58.171
PLACE BEFORE WE'RE GONNA BE

03:41:58.238 --> 03:42:00.507
ABLE TO DO THAT WITH ANY.

03:42:00.573 --> 03:42:03.476
PREDICTABLE UP SO THAT LEADS ME

03:42:03.543 --> 03:42:05.612

03:42:05.679 --> 03:42:07.781
COMMENT WHICH- HAS TO DO WITH

03:42:07.847 --> 03:42:09.349

03:42:09.416 --> 03:42:11.651
THAT- WITHOUT GOING INTO A LOT

03:42:11.718 --> 03:42:15.288
OF DETAIL ABOUT CONTACT TRACING.

03:42:15.355 --> 03:42:17.791
THE FEWER ACTUAL TASKS THAT ARE

03:42:17.857 --> 03:42:18.992
OUT THERE THE MORE IMPORTANT

03:42:19.059 --> 03:42:21.461
THE CONTACT TRACING BECOMES AND

03:42:21.528 --> 03:42:24.998
IT'S LABOR INTENSIVE IT IS

03:42:25.065 --> 03:42:25.765
SOMETHING THAT WILL TAKE SOME

03:42:25.832 --> 03:42:29.836
AMOUNT TIME TO RAMP UP. AND HI

03:42:29.903 --> 03:42:31.604
I ASSUME IT'S SOMETHING THAT

THE ADMINISTRATION IS GIVING A

03:42:32.772 --> 03:42:33.940
LOT OF THOUGHT TO I CERTAINLY

PREVENTION AND EARLIER I

03:49:36.696 --> 03:49:38.898
MENTIONED- THE LEGISLATION I'VE

03:49:38.965 --> 03:49:41.033
WORKED ON. OUR AND HIS GLUCOSE

03:49:41.100 --> 03:49:42.802
MONITORS AND YOU KNOW FOR THREE

03:49:42.869 --> 03:49:44.270
YEARS RUNNING I INTRODUCED THAT

03:49:44.337 --> 03:49:46.105
LEGISLATION- AND FOR THREE

03:49:46.172 --> 03:49:47.406
YEARS RUNNING DEPARTMENT

03:49:47.473 --> 03:49:49.208
FINANCE SENT A LOT OF

03:49:49.275 --> 03:49:52.011
OPPOSITION. AND GIVEN THAT WE

03:49:52.078 --> 03:49:54.347
KNOW SEE GM'S REDUCE DIABETES

03:49:54.413 --> 03:49:56.782
RELATED HOSPITALIZATION BY. AS

03:49:56.849 --> 03:49:58.951
MUCH AS SEVEN FIVE PERCENT. AND

03:49:59.018 --> 03:50:02.421
GIVEN THAT DURING THE SURGE-

03:50:02.488 --> 03:50:04.290
AND COVERT NINETEEN WE'VE SEEN

03:50:04.357 --> 03:50:05.625

HOSPITALIZATIONS ACCOUNT FOR AS

03:50:07.527 --> 03:50:09.195
MUCH AS THIRTY PERCENT. OF THE

03:50:09.262 --> 03:50:11.664
PROBLEM. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THE

03:50:11.731 --> 03:50:12.732
DEPARTMENT FINANCE WAS SHORT

03:50:12.798 --> 03:50:15.801
SIGHTED- IN ITS OPPOSITION TO

03:50:15.868 --> 03:50:20.439
MY LEGISLATION. ALL ONE OF OUR

03:50:20.506 --> 03:50:33.085
GREAT. ALL THIS IS ADAM DORSEY

03:50:33.152 --> 03:50:34.720
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- YOU

03:50:34.787 --> 03:50:36.122
KNOW I THINK THE WAY THAT I

03:50:36.189 --> 03:50:38.324
WOULD LOOK AT THIS ISSUE- IS

03:50:38.391 --> 03:50:40.026
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

03:50:40.092 --> 03:50:41.627
HAVE A VALUE WAITED FOR A

03:50:41.694 --> 03:50:44.063
COUPLE YEARS NOW AND IT'S PART

03:50:44.130 --> 03:50:46.199
OF THE OVERALL CONTEXT OF ALL

03:50:46.265 --> 03:50:47.900
THE RESOURCE DECISIONS THAT ARE

03:50:47.967 --> 03:50:50.903
MADE AND SO- BUT WHILE WE AGREE

03:50:50.970 --> 03:50:52.905
THERE IS. YOU KNOW AT AT AT

03:50:52.972 --> 03:50:54.540
LEAST FOR CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE

03:50:54.607 --> 03:50:57.843
MONITORS AND A BENEFIT TO YOU

03:50:57.910 --> 03:51:00.179
PATIENTS- THERE'S ALSO A COST

03:51:00.246 --> 03:51:01.447
ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND IT HAS

03:51:01.514 --> 03:51:03.449
TO BE PRIORITIZED WITHIN THE

03:51:03.516 --> 03:51:05.818
CONTEXT OF ALL THE DECISIONS

03:51:05.885 --> 03:51:07.053
THAT WERE MAKING AND SO. I

03:51:07.119 --> 03:51:09.689
THINK THAT'S JUST THE LANDS IN

03:51:09.755 --> 03:51:10.957
THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE TO

03:51:11.023 --> 03:51:12.425
TAKE WITH THE WITH NOT ONLY

03:51:12.491 --> 03:51:15.728
THAT BUT WITH WHAT ALL. CAPTION

03:51:15.795 --> 03:51:18.064
AND YOU KNOW AT YOU EXPAND. ITS

03:51:18.130 --> 03:51:19.198
THERE IS A COST THERE'S ALSO

03:51:19.265 --> 03:51:21.434
BENEFIT AND SO. I'M HAVING TO

03:51:21.500 --> 03:51:23.069
CONSTANTLY WEIGH THESE WITH ALL

03:51:23.135 --> 03:51:24.937
OF THE OTHER. YOU KNOW

03:51:25.004 --> 03:51:26.472
POTENTIAL EXPANSIONS THAT'S

03:51:26.539 --> 03:51:27.673
THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

03:51:27.740 --> 03:51:29.542
TO DO. I'LL GO AHEAD AND PUT

03:51:29.609 --> 03:51:32.311
THAT DOWN AS A YES AND- DOUBLE

03:51:32.378 --> 03:51:35.081
DOWN ON MY- YOU KNOW. SUPPORT

03:51:35.147 --> 03:51:37.216
FOR. MY COLLEGE POINT WHICH IS

03:51:37.283 --> 03:51:39.452
PREVENTION IS EXPENSIVE ON THE

03:51:39.518 --> 03:51:40.886
FRONT END BUT IT'S IMPORTANT

03:51:40.953 --> 03:51:42.121
AND WE'RE SEEING THE VERY REAL

03:51:42.188 --> 03:51:44.423
WORLD CONSEQUENCES. OF THAT

03:51:44.490 --> 03:51:46.325
ACTIVITY RIGHT NOW I ALSO WANNA

03:51:46.392 --> 03:51:48.261
JUST REAL QUICKLY TOUCH ON SOME

03:51:48.327 --> 03:51:50.630
ANSWERS YOU PROVIDE RECALLING

03:51:50.696 --> 03:51:51.330
FROM SANTA BARBARA IN RESPECT

03:51:51.397 --> 03:51:53.466
TO FEDERAL MONEY. AND I WANT TO

03:51:53.532 --> 03:51:55.034
MAKE SURE THAT IS NOT THE

03:51:55.101 --> 03:51:56.736
DEPARTMENT FINANCES POSITION

03:51:56.802 --> 03:51:58.738
THAT WERE. WAITING FOR THE

03:51:58.804 --> 03:52:00.273
CAVALRY TO ARRIVE FROM THE

03:52:00.339 --> 03:52:01.307
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE

03:52:01.374 --> 03:52:02.275
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE

03:52:02.341 --> 03:52:03.943
CAVALRY TO ARRIVE INFEDERAL

03:52:04.010 --> 03:52:05.711
GOVERNMENT FOR DECADES. AND

03:52:05.778 --> 03:52:09.515
UNDER BOTH. DEMOCRATIC AND

03:52:09.582 --> 03:52:11.417
REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS WE-

03:52:11.484 --> 03:52:14.287
ADDITIONAL THAT. SLOT

03:52:14.353 --> 03:52:15.288
ACCREDITATION NURSING. IT HAS

03:52:15.354 --> 03:52:19.025
BEEN A CALL FINANCER. AND SO I

03:52:19.091 --> 03:52:20.559
HOPE ALTHOUGH I REALIZE IT'S

03:52:20.626 --> 03:52:22.228
DIFFICULT TO PRIORITIZE THESE

03:52:22.295 --> 03:52:24.897
DOLLARS DURING. A CRISIS LIKE

03:52:24.964 --> 03:52:26.499
THIS DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN

03:52:26.565 --> 03:52:28.567
IT IS NEVER BEEN. MORE

03:52:28.634 --> 03:52:31.404
IMPORTANT THAT WE DO. EXACTLY

03:52:31.470 --> 03:52:33.005

WHERE WE CAN RETURN TO GOOD

03:54:39.598 --> 03:54:41.467
ECONOMY THE WHAT. THE WE'RE NOT

THOUGHTFULNESS AND THE- IN IN

03:54:56.482 --> 03:54:57.950
IN THE WAY WE DO THIS. AND I

03:54:58.017 --> 03:54:59.285
HOPE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET

03:54:59.351 --> 03:55:07.293
THERE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

03:55:07.359 --> 03:55:10.796
I UP. COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS.

03:55:10.863 --> 03:55:13.866
ABOUT CITIES AND UP AND ABOUT

03:55:13.933 --> 03:55:17.636
TRANSIT. HI I TRANSIT IS BEING

03:55:17.703 --> 03:55:19.538
VERY VERY HARD HIT AS IS EVERY

03:55:19.605 --> 03:55:22.708
OTHER SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY-

03:55:22.775 --> 03:55:28.481
AND- WE'RE NOT IT WOULD IF THE

03:55:28.547 --> 03:55:29.648
ABILITY TO GET FROM PLACE TO

03:55:29.715 --> 03:55:31.383
PLACE DOESN'T EXIST FOR THE

03:55:31.450 --> 03:55:33.352
WORK FORCE WHEN PEOPLE NEED TO

03:55:33.419 --> 03:55:35.821
COME BACK TO WORK. OF A WE HAVE

03:55:35.888 --> 03:55:36.856
AN UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL

03:55:36.922 --> 03:55:40.459
PROBLEM THAT TO- IS- IS GOING

03:55:40.526 --> 03:55:42.061
TO BE A DRAG ON THE ECONOMY SO

03:55:42.127 --> 03:55:43.929
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED

03:55:43.996 --> 03:55:46.232
TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO-

03:55:46.298 --> 03:55:48.300
AGAIN CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE

03:55:48.367 --> 03:55:51.036
BEING AS HARD HIT AS- AS THE AS

03:55:51.103 --> 03:55:53.205
THE STATUS IN SOME CASES ARE

03:55:53.272 --> 03:55:56.609
EVEN WORSE. AND I WANT TO URGE

03:55:56.675 --> 03:55:59.879
THE- ADMINISTRATION TO BE VERY

03:55:59.945 --> 03:56:02.982
CAUTIOUS- WE TALK ABOUT ONE

03:56:03.048 --> 03:56:06.018
ISSUE- LAST WEEK WITH THE- A

03:56:06.085 --> 03:56:07.720
SALES TAX REBATE FOR BUSINESSES

03:56:07.786 --> 03:56:10.022
IS A VERY WELL GROUNDED TO AND

03:56:10.089 --> 03:56:11.590
A GOOD IDEA AND IT'S GONNA BE

03:56:11.657 --> 03:56:13.425
VERY HELPFUL TO BUSINESS BUT IT

03:56:13.492 --> 03:56:16.962
HASN'T UNINTENDED IMPACT ON. ON

03:56:17.029 --> 03:56:20.699
ON LOCAL OMMUNITIES- AND THAT

03:56:20.766 --> 03:56:22.034
WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS

03:56:22.101 --> 03:56:23.035
TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN

03:56:23.102 --> 03:56:24.603
THE ORIGINAL DECISION WAS

03:56:24.670 --> 03:56:28.340
MAKING OUT WITH MADE OF US A

03:56:28.407 --> 03:56:32.244
SIMILARLY I THINK THE- ARE THE

03:56:32.311 --> 03:56:35.648
FOR SENIORS. IS IN A GREAT

03:56:35.714 --> 03:56:38.517
PROGRAM- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING

03:56:38.584 --> 03:56:42.221
IS THAT TO A- ON THE OUR

03:56:42.288 --> 03:56:43.889
PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE

03:56:43.956 --> 03:56:45.391
ADMINISTERED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

03:56:45.457 --> 03:56:47.927
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND- I

03:56:47.993 --> 03:56:49.361
WOULD URGE THE ADMINISTRATION

03:56:49.428 --> 03:56:52.331
TO GIVE THOUGHT TO- HOW LOCAL

03:56:52.398 --> 03:56:52.898
GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO BE

03:56:52.965 --> 03:56:54.466
ABLE TO AFFORD TO DO THAT. AT A

03:56:54.533 --> 03:56:57.336
TIME WHEN THEY ARE- IN VERY

03:56:57.403 --> 03:56:58.938
DEEP FINANCIAL DISTRESS

03:56:59.004 --> 03:57:02.274
THEMSELVES AND- OR IF YOU WANT

03:57:02.341 --> 03:57:04.410
TO RESPOND TO THAT BUT- IT IT

03:57:04.476 --> 03:57:05.277
COULD BE JUST LEFT AS A

03:57:05.344 --> 03:57:08.013
COMMENT- AT AT THIS POINT IF

03:57:08.080 --> 03:57:14.954
THAT'S PREFERRED. YES ASSEMBLY

03:57:15.020 --> 03:57:16.855
MEMBER WE WILL DEFINITELY IT

03:57:16.922 --> 03:57:19.058
TAKE YOUR- FEEDBACK BACK I

03:57:19.124 --> 03:57:20.225
THINK THE ONE THING WILL SAY

03:57:20.292 --> 03:57:22.595
ON- THAT SUBJECT TO THE SENIOR

03:57:22.661 --> 03:57:25.230
MALES IS THAT OUR EXPECTATION

03:57:25.297 --> 03:57:25.931
IS THAT THAT THAT YOU ALREADY

03:57:25.998 --> 03:57:28.200
HAVE THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE PAID

03:57:28.267 --> 03:57:30.436
FOR BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

03:57:30.502 --> 03:57:32.805
REGINA AND THE STATE WILL ALSO

03:57:32.871 --> 03:57:34.707
BE- PROVIDING SOME

03:57:34.773 --> 03:57:36.609
REIMBURSEMENT SO WHILE LOCALS

03:57:36.675 --> 03:57:39.812
WILL- HAVE SOME EXPENDITURE. IT

03:57:39.878 --> 03:57:40.613
WILL BE A SMALL PART OF THE

03:57:40.679 --> 03:57:42.548
OVERALL COST. OKAY WELL ON

03:57:42.615 --> 03:57:46.051
WORK- ANXIOUSLY AWAIT TO HEAR A

03:57:46.118 --> 03:57:48.587
MORE DETAILS ON THAT- WHEN IT

COMES TO US SETTING GOALS I

03:57:50.723 --> 03:57:52.791
THINK ONE OF OUR GOALS OUGHT TO

03:57:52.858 --> 03:57:55.995
BE. THAT WE OF- NOT ALLOW THIS

03:57:56.061 --> 03:57:59.331
PANDEMIC TO BE. THE END OF THE

03:57:59.398 --> 03:58:02.368
MOM AND POP ECONOMY- WRIT LARGE

03:58:02.434 --> 03:58:04.803
WHETHER IT'S RESTAURANTS AND TO

03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:08.540
A SMALL MARKETS- OF A RETAIL

OUTLETS- LANDLORDS WITH THE-

03:58:12.277 --> 03:58:13.879
WITH SMALL BUILDING SMALL.

03:58:16.682 --> 03:58:20.319
THE BOARD. OF THE THAT IS BAD

03:58:20.386 --> 03:58:22.921
ROCK CALIFORNIA'S ITS- BEDROCK

03:58:22.988 --> 03:58:25.924
CUT. AMERICA AND WE REALLY

03:58:25.991 --> 03:58:28.427
CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO DISAPPEAR

03:58:28.494 --> 03:58:30.262
SO THAT SHE- DOES SOMETHING A

03:58:30.329 --> 03:58:31.930
LOT OF ATTENTION TO. I'M FINE I

03:58:31.997 --> 03:58:34.800
WANT TO THERE THERE WERE SOME

03:58:34.867 --> 03:58:36.669
COME ABOUT. OF THE REGULATORY

03:58:36.735 --> 03:58:42.074
ENVIRONMENT AND I WANT TO POINT

03:58:42.141 --> 03:58:43.409
OUT THAT REGULATIONS AT NEVER

03:58:43.475 --> 03:58:44.276
BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH INTENT TO

03:58:44.343 --> 03:58:46.412
STYMIE BUSINESS GROW CAL BROKE

03:58:46.478 --> 03:58:49.181
GROWTH. OF CALIFORNIA HAS

03:58:49.248 --> 03:58:50.315
REALLY BEEN AT THE LEAD OF

03:58:50.382 --> 03:58:51.383
SHOWING HOW OU CAN DEVELOP

03:58:51.450 --> 03:58:53.886
PUBLIC HEALTH REGULATIONS THAT

03:58:53.952 --> 03:58:56.588
PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AND STILL

03:58:56.655 --> 03:58:58.123
GROW THE CONOMY ALL WE HAVE TO

03:58:58.190 --> 03:58:59.291
DO IS LOOK AT THE LAST SEVERAL

03:58:59.358 --> 03:59:03.195
YEARS. AGO HERE TO UNDERSTAND

03:59:03.262 --> 03:59:04.096
THAT AND SO THE GOVERNOR

03:59:04.163 --> 03:59:05.964
CONTINUES TO HAVE A

03:59:06.031 --> 03:59:07.232

STAKEHOLDERS. OF WE CANNOT

03:59:10.569 --> 03:59:12.938
ALLOW PUBLIC HEALTH TO TEND TO.

03:59:13.005 --> 03:59:14.873
NOT BE THE PRIMARY

03:59:14.940 --> 03:59:16.208
CONSIDERATION IN THE OVERALL

03:59:16.275 --> 03:59:17.309

THRIVING ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT

03:59:22.715 --> 03:59:24.950
ARE- THE MOST BURDEN TO THOSE

03:59:25.017 --> 03:59:26.485
MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES I

03:59:26.552 --> 03:59:29.254
BEGAN BY- A SPEAKING ABOUT. A

03:59:29.321 --> 03:59:31.890

03:59:50.442 --> 03:59:53.545
COUPLE POINTS- I THINK EARLIER-

03:59:53.612 --> 03:59:54.379
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BROKE BROUGHT

03:59:54.446 --> 03:59:56.482
UP THE CONCEPT OF UNIVERSAL

03:59:56.548 --> 03:59:59.618
PROTECTIONS AND- I MIGHT CHANGE

03:59:59.685 --> 04:00:00.819
THE PHRASE OF THAT A LITTLE BIT

04:00:00.886 --> 04:00:03.055
AND BECAUSE OF MY PROFESSION WE

04:00:03.122 --> 04:00:04.990
CALL UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS AND

04:00:05.057 --> 04:00:06.792
SO WE TREAT EVERYBODY AS IF

04:00:06.859 --> 04:00:07.760
THEY ARE POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS

04:00:07.826 --> 04:00:09.661
REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER. AND

04:00:09.728 --> 04:00:12.998
THAT REALLY BEGAN- NGUYEN WITH

04:00:13.065 --> 04:00:14.733
THE ONSET OF THE HIV CRISIS AND

SO WE ARE VERY CUSTOM TO

04:00:18.003 --> 04:00:18.737
TREATING EVERYBODY AS IF THEY

04:00:18.804 --> 04:00:20.339
ARE INFECTED BY WHO KNOWS WHAT

04:00:20.405 --> 04:00:22.841
AND SO I THINK- I THINK WHAT

04:00:22.908 --> 04:00:24.109
WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THERE

04:00:24.176 --> 04:00:25.244
GOING TO BE SOME GUIDANCE ON

04:00:25.310 --> 04:00:27.012
WHAT UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS

04:00:27.079 --> 04:00:28.413
MIGHT BE LIKE FOR DIFFERENT

04:00:28.480 --> 04:00:31.016
SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY- BASED

04:00:31.083 --> 04:00:34.553

04:00:43.095 --> 04:00:44.596
THINK THEY COST ACCORDING WOULD

04:00:44.663 --> 04:00:46.365
GO. BETWEEN ABOUT FOURTEEN

04:00:46.431 --> 04:00:48.567
HUNDRED DOLLARS APIECE- THAT IS

04:00:48.634 --> 04:00:51.470
A- VERY VERY SMALL PRICE WHEN

04:00:51.537 --> 04:00:52.504
