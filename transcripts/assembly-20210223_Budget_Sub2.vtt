AND JUST INCREASED- PRESSURED

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:48.606
FOR EMPLOYEE SALARIES

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:50.675
ESPECIALLY AFTER NOT RECEIVING

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:53.444
A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT IN

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:55.179
THE CURRENT YEAR. SO THE CALL

00:36:55.246 --> 00:36:57.448
RATE WHICH IS BASED ON A PRICE

00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:58.616
INDEX. FOR STATE LOCAL

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:00.851
GOVERNMENTS WILL BE UPDATED IN

LEGISLATION WILL HAVE A MUCH

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:06.223
BETTER IDEA OF WHAT REVENUES

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.860
ARE- AND THAT WILL IMPACT

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:11.095
WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND

00:37:11.162 --> 00:37:12.363

ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:20.004

MAY THE LEGISLATURE MAY I WISH

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:25.710
TO PROVIDE AN EVEN LARGER. COST

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:26.744
OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR A

00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:28.245
PORTION IT'S THAN WHAT THE

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:28.846
GOVERNOR IS CURRENTLY

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:31.248
PROPOSING. THE LEGISLATURE

00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:32.483
COULD ALSO CONSIDER RE

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.951
PURPOSING LOWER PRIORITY

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:35.186
PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:37.355
BUDGET TO SUPPORT A LARGER BASE

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.522
OF PORTION INCREASING

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:40.825
THROUGHOUT OUR BUDGET ANALYSIS-

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:42.760
IN THIS HEARING- WE WILL

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:44.562
IDENTIFY WE IDENTIFY SOME OF

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:45.997
THOSE PROPOSALS THAT MIGHT BE

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:49.333
GOOD CANDIDATES. FOR SUCH A

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.701
REDIRECTION. WITH THREE TO THE

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:52.269
PROPOSAL FOR DISTRICTS TO

00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:54.538
DEVELOP STUDENT EQUITY PLANS AS

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:56.440
A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THEIR

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:57.775
COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT WE

00:37:57.842 --> 00:37:58.909
WOULD NOTE THAT SUCH A

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:00.277
REQUIREMENT WOULD REALLY BE

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:01.612
REDUNDANT THIS IS BECAUSE

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.648
DISTRICTS. ALREADY MUST DEVELOP

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:05.549
AN UPDATE STUDENT EQUITY PLANS

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:07.485
AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING

00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:08.319
STUDENT EQUITY ACHIEVEMENT

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:10.655
CATEGORICAL FUNDS SO WE

00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:11.722
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:14.191
REJECT THAT PROPOSED CONDITION.

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:16.794
AS REGARDS TO THE PROPOSED

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.596
CONDITION ON MAKING THAT CALL

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:20.865
OUR TO DO ONLINE INSTRUCTION

00:38:20.931 --> 00:38:22.566
MAINTAIN TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:26.037
HIGHER THAN PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS.

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.338
THIS PROPOSAL REALLY STRIKES

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:30.341
ISN'T ARBITRARY YOU HAVE-

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:32.176
COASTLINE IN COLLEGE IN ORANGE

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:35.713
COUNTY THAT'S ALREADY IT. 78%

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.615
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:38.282
NINETEEN NOT SURE WHAT'S

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:39.850
NECESSARILY DESIRABLE ABOUT

00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:42.286
HAVING HIM STAY AT EIGHTY EIGHT

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:44.588
PERCENT. OUR OTHER COLLEGES

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:45.489
HISTORICALLY DO MOSTLY IN

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:48.292
PERSON INSTRUCTION BECAUSE THEY

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:49.627
HAVE MORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:51.328
CURRENT TECHNICAL EDUCATION TO

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:52.797
BE MORE HANDS ON OVER THERE AND

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:54.498
RURAL AREAS WHERE STUDENTS

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:55.766
MIGHT HAVE LOWER INTERNET

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:59.670
CONNECTIVITY SO WE RECOMMEND

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:02.673
REJECTING. THAT PROPOSAL. ONE

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.276
OF THE PROPOSED PAY- WE THINK

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:06.510
THE GOVERNOR'S ON THE RIGHT

00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:08.846
TRACK HE WOULD. HE WOULD

00:39:08.913 --> 00:39:11.248
ELIMINATE ONE ABOUT ONE POINT

00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:12.616
ONE BILLION OF THE ONE POINT

00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:14.785
FIVE BILLION IN DEFERRALS- IN

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:16.954
THE BUDGET YEAR BUT LEAVING.

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:18.222
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:19.924
DOLLARS THAT WOULD JUST BE AN

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.293
ONGOING DEFERRAL UNTIL THAT'S

00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:24.128
PAID OFF- AND WITH NO TIMELINE

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:26.630
OF WHEN THAT MIGHT BE PAID OFF.

00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:27.665
BY THE ADMINISTRATION. SO WE

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:29.333
THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.468
THINK ABOUT GOING EVEN FURTHER

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:31.969
THAN THE GOVERNOR USING ONE

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:34.038
TIME FUNDS TO RETIRE MORE OF

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:34.805
THESE DIFFERENT ROLES IN THE

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:35.806
BUDGET YEAR HAS SEVERAL

00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:37.108
ADVANTAGES INCLUDING HELPING

00:39:37.174 --> 00:39:39.276
DISTRICTS WITH THEIR-

00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:41.245
BORROWING- THEY DON'T HAVE TO

00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:42.379
BORROW AS MUCH FOR CASH FLOW

00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:43.881
PURPOSES. IT ALSO GIVES THE

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:46.751
LEGISLATURE MORE BUDGET TOOLS

00:39:46.817 --> 00:39:47.351
TO RESPOND TO FUTURE ECONOMIC

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:50.221
DOWNTURNS. AND WE ARE.

00:39:50.287 --> 00:39:51.655
THROUGHOUT OUR BUDGET HOUSES WE

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:52.823
IDENTIFY LOWER PRIORITY

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.792
PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:55.493
BUDGET THAT WE THINK COULD BE

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:57.294
USED INSTEAD. TO PAY DOWN MORE

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:59.230
DEFERRALS OR TO HELP DISTRICTS

00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:00.731
IN OTHER WAYS SUCH AS BY

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:02.500
MITIGATING THEIR FUTURE PENSION

00:40:02.566 --> 00:40:04.902
COSTS INCREASED. SO THE LAST

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:06.871
ISSUE IN THAT LAST TOPIC IN

00:40:06.937 --> 00:40:09.440
ISSUE ONE. CONCERN THIS

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:11.475
AGREEMENT PROPOSAL. WHICH

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:13.077
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED

TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:40:16.313 --> 00:40:18.916
SO IT'S OF COURSE HIGHLY IN

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:20.651
THIS POINT WHAT A MOMENT DEMAND

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:23.687
WILL BE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:25.089
TWO. OH REALLY UNCLEAR AT THIS

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:27.124
POINT WHAT MIGHT BE NEEDED AS

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:29.593
FAR AS A MOMENT THE FUNDING. IF

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.796

00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:38.102
THEIR PHYSICAL. IN THE FALL AND

THE ECONOMY SLOW TO RECOVER.

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:41.806
THEIR COMMITTEE COLLEGES COULD

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:44.642
SEE A SURGE ENROLLMENT.

00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:45.709
ATTENTION ON THE OTHER HAND OF

COLLEGE AND SCHOOLS REMAIN

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:49.847
PRIMARILY.ONLINE IN THE FALL

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:51.615
WE COULD SEE THESE CURRENT

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:59.924
ENROLLMENT- TRENDS PERSIST. SO

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.958
LATER THIS THE CHANCELLOR

I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:01.751
WOULD LIKE THE ADMINISTRATION

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:04.788

WANT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD THIS

00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:23.807
MORNING. BUT I THINK IT'S

00:57:23.873 --> 00:57:26.142
NONSENSE THAT THE BUYING POWER

00:57:26.209 --> 00:57:27.043
FOR THE RIVERSIDE SCHOOL

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:28.711
DISTRICT IS THE SAME FOR THE

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:29.512
RIVERSIDE COMMUNICABLE

00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:32.215
DISTRICT. THE COST OF UTILITIES

00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:34.717
AND LABOR. AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:37.053
IS THE SAME AND RIVERSIDE. SAN

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.355
JOSE SACRAMENTO LONG BEACH AND

00:57:39.422 --> 00:57:42.492
THEN NORTH LA SO IT'S TO JUST

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:43.459
TO HAVE THIS DIFFERENTIAL

00:57:43.526 --> 00:57:46.396
THING. IS JUST TOTALLY UNFAIR

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:47.797
AND JUST KIND OF CLUELESS TO

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:49.999
WHAT THE REALITY IS- OBVIOUSLY

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:51.401
I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:57:51.467 --> 00:57:52.535
FINANCES TO PUT TOGETHER A

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:54.337
BUDGET. AND MAYBE OR JUST

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:55.305
PENCILING THIS NUMBER I THERE

00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:56.539
TO EXPECT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:59.075
WE COULD AFFORD. BUT DID TO BUT

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:01.878
TO SAY THAT IT'S THE FAIR

00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:02.312
FORMULA BASED UPON A

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:04.480
CALCULATION. DOESN'T MEAN ANY

00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:06.583
SENSE BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU

00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:07.217
WOULDN'T HAVE THAT HIGHER COLA

00:58:07.283 --> 00:58:09.485
FOR OTHER. INDIVIDUALS IN THE

00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:11.921
EDUCATION WORLD AS WELL- SO

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:13.923
CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:15.725
WE HELP WITH INCREASE REVENUES

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:17.460

HOW THE ECONOMY IS MOVING ALONG

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:23.166
THAT IT. AT OF IMPRESSIVE CLIP

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:25.301
SO. CERTAINLY THERE THAT COULD

00:58:25.368 --> 00:58:26.736
CHANGE WITH NEW RABBITS COMMAND

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:27.871
AFTER THEY PULL TAX RECEIPTS

00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:28.938
AND GET THE MAY REVISE BUT

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:29.906
SOMETHING THAT WE MADE WE MAY

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:31.708
LOOK AT TO REGARDLESS AS FAR AS

00:58:31.774 --> 00:58:33.743
HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAVE. IN IN

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.078
PROP NINETY EIGHT SO THAT'S

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:37.347
SAYS THAT AN INEQUITY. AND THEN

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:39.115
AND THEN TYING IT TO THESE

00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:42.485
OTHER PIECES FOR- ONLINE I'M

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:44.020
NOT SURE THAT THE WISDOM OF

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:47.190

00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:48.591
GONNA DO IT DO IT BUT WHITE

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:50.426
WHITE TIE IT TO SOME ARBITRARY

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:52.428
OTHER PIECE. ESPECIALLY WHEN

00:58:52.495 --> 00:58:52.829
THERE'S SO MUCH

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:55.665

00:59:06.409 --> 00:59:08.411
AS FAR AS THE ENROLLMENT YOU

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:15.218
INTERESTING BECAUSE USUALLY.

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:16.519

PANDEMIC AND THIS SUBCOMMITTEE

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.815
IS HEARD ABOUT THIS THE LAST

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.950
SEVERAL YEARS- THE PROBLEMS

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:03.186
EVEN GOTTEN WORSE SINCE THE

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:05.455
PANDEMIC BEGAN. TO DATE THE

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:07.457
STATE'S APPROACH TO ADDRESSING

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:09.826
BASIC NEEDS HAS BEEN RATHER

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:12.595
PIECEMEAL. A LOT OF ONE TIME

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:15.164
FUNDING AND LACK LACKING AN

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:16.799
OVERARCHING GOALS AND

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:19.202
STRATEGIES FOR WHAT WE WANT TO

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:22.071
ACHIEVE. AND HOW TO DO IT

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.306
ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:24.841
COMMENDED FOR THIS FOCUSES

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.843
APPROACH HOUSE OF ELEMENTS WE

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:29.979
THINK COULD BE IMPROVED UPON.

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:31.414
FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR'S

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.216
BUDGET DOESN'T SPECIFY HOW TO

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:35.485
PROPOSE NEW PROGRAMS WOULD

01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:37.987
INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. APPLE

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:39.388
AS WELL AS HOW THEY'D INTERACT

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:40.890
WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS OF THE

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:41.858
COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:44.093
POTENTIALLY THE PROPOSAL COULD

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.730
CREATE MORE SILOS. ARE ALSO.

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:49.398
ANOTHER ELEMENT WE THINK COULD

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.567
BE IMPROVED IMPROVED UPON IS

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:53.136
THE GOVERNOR PROVIDE IT'S ONE

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:55.338
TIME FUNDS FOR A PURPOSE FOOD

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.306
PANTRY AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE

01:02:57.373 --> 01:02:59.542
PROGRAMS IT REALLY REQUIRES

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:02.311
SOME ONGOING FUNDING TO BE

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:03.813
SUSTAINABLE. ALTHOUGH THE

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.815
GOVERNOR'S APPROACH- THE

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:07.350
GOVERNOR'S APPROACH ALSO

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:08.918
PROVIDES FUNDS WITHOUT ANY

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:10.720
EXPECTATION OF LEVELS OF

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:14.157
SERVICE OR DESIRED OUTCOMES. SO

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:15.925
WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:03:15.992 --> 01:03:17.894
CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.096
APPROACH BY CREATING A BASIC

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:22.331
NEEDS BLOCK GRANTS THE IDEA

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:24.267
HERE WOULD BE TO USE ALL OR A

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.369
PORTION OF THE PROPOSED MONEY

01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:27.870

FOOD AND HOUSING IN THE

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:31.007
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND INTEGRATE

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:32.375
THAT MONEY WITH THE EXISTING

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:35.178
ONGOING FUNDS FROM THE- RAPID

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:37.313
RE HOUSING PROGRAM THAT THAT

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.048
NINE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:41.751
IT'S PROVIDED ALONG WITH THIS

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:43.219
APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:46.222
BE CLEAR ABOUT EXPECTATIONS

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:48.691
MINIMUM SERVICE LEVELS AND

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:50.726
DESIRED OUTCOMES. BUT THEN GIVE

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:52.495
FLEXIBILITY TO THE COLLEGE

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.096
DECIDE HOW TO STRUCTURE THEIR

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:56.465
PROGRAMS HOW TO USE THE FUNDING

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:58.034
FOR EXAMPLE DISTRICTS COULD

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.736
CHOOSE TO HIRE A BASIC NEEDS

01:04:00.803 --> 01:04:03.406

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:05.208
ESTABLISH A ONE STOP HUB JUST

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:07.043
AN EXAMPLE PROS THEY MIGHT WANT

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:09.278
TO TAKE. WITH THIS MONEY AND

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.747
THEN CREATE ALL OF THIS MONEY-

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:14.116
IN THE WAY THEY SEE FIT TO

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.785
ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:17.153
SHE COULD HAVE DISTRICTS REPORT

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.088
REGULARLY ON SERVICE LEVELS

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:20.890
SUCH AS APPOINTMENT WAIT TIMES

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.258
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS SERVE

ISSUES SO CERTAINLY THIS IS A

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.582
TOPIC THAT HAS GARNERED

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.684
INCREASED ATTENTION IN SUPPORT

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:42.985
IN THE LEGISLATURE THE LAST FEW

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:45.321
YEARS WE REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT

JUST THE CAMPUS THAT THE THAT

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:50.326
THE FACULTY THAT TRADITIONAL.

COURSE- ALL OF THESE CAMPUSES

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:21.223

MAY BE RESPOND TO WHAT THE L.

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:39.108
A. I WAS TALKING ABOUT AN INCH

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:41.477
INCH AS OPPOSED TO PICKING AND

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:43.579
CHOOSING WINNERS AND LOSERS

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:45.481
WHETHER IT'S ON GOING OR ONE

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:47.449
TIME AND- OF COURSE I THINK

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:49.151
THESE BASIC THESE ARE OUR

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:51.220
ONGOING ISSUES AND SO. IT'S

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:53.589
HARD TO GET GOING WITH THESE

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:56.258
EFFORTS WITH ONE TIME MONEY- IS

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:57.927
THERE MERIT TO THIS IDEA OF

01:09:57.993 --> 01:09:59.361
THAT WE SHOULD THEY WE SHOULD

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:00.829
HAVE THESE KIND OF MANY

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:03.666
CATEGORICAL HERE BUT MORE BROAD

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:04.633
BLOCK GRANT FOR THE CALL JUST

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.869

ADDRESSING BASIC NEEDS SO WE DO

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:40.736
THINK THERE IS MERIT IN

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:43.639
CONSIDERING HOW WE CREATE. AN

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:45.207
INTERSECTION BETWEEN ALL OF

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:50.913
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- WE

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.948
BELIEVE OUT HAS SOME

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:55.484
CONSIDERATION AND- WE THINK OUR

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.653
COLLEGES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:58.821
OUR STUDENTS COULD BENEFIT FROM

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:00.723
SUCH AN APPROACH SO DO YOU OR

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:02.424
DON'T USE SUPPORT WITH THE L.

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:04.526
A- RECOMMENDS INCREASING AS

BLOCK GRANTS FOR THESE MONIES

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:07.863
AND OTHER MONIES OR SHOULD WE

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:12.368

THREE EACH OF THESE. ALL I

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:17.706
THINK AS IN AND POLICY EFFORTS

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:32.087
COMPREHENSIVE IN NATURE THAT

THAT THINK THEY'RE MANY

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:05.354
PROBLEMS. AND DETAILS THAT

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:09.058

TEN AND HOW BEST TO MEET THAT

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:40.889
THE- BASIC NEEDS OF OUR

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:43.158
STUDENTS. OF OUR COMMUNITY

TO ADDRESS THE- SPECIFIC BASIC

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:49.398
NEEDS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.633

AND CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:01.543
BEST TO ADDRESS THOSE. YEAH

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:04.046
IT'S- AND AS FAR AS A MENTAL

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:05.681
HEALTH I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:07.316
THAT THE GOVERNOR PUTTING AT

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:08.751
THE PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET BUT

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:10.185
LINKING THAT MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:13:10.252 --> 01:13:11.887
TECHNOLOGY IT SEEMS KIND OF

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:13.655
RANDOM THINGS ARE BOTH.

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:16.859
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE SHOULD

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:18.794
FOCUS ON BOTH OF THOSE. I WILL

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:20.295
NOTE THAT AS FAR AS MENTAL

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:22.197
HEALTH THERE IS MONEY OF COURSE

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:23.132
HERE AND THERE IS ANOTHER

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:25.367
EFFORT THAT. THAT THAT I'M

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:27.402
WORKING ON AND OTHERS. TO LOOK

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:30.172
AT THE PROP SIXTY THREE FIND

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:31.373
AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THE

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.475
MILLIONAIRES TAX FOR. MENTAL

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:35.577
HEALTH WHICH THAT FIND IT YOU

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:36.979
KNOW IT'S CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.847
ARE DOING QUITE WELL CALIFORNIA

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:41.016
MEANING YOUR DISTRICT RIGHT.

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:44.253
THEY- THAT FUND IS JUST

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:47.055
EXPLODING AND- WITH THERE'S AN

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:48.924
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND BECAUSE

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:50.225
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:51.326
COLLEGE STUDENTS AND I THINK

01:13:51.393 --> 01:13:52.494
THAT'S A BIG PRIMARY THAT AND

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:53.662
WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:54.663
GOING TO TESTIFY FOR THAT IN A

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.799
FEW SECONDS. BUT THE ONE THING

01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:57.499
TOO I KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:58.901
SOMEONE MEMBER BERMAN HAS AN

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:01.003
IDEA ON THIS IS THAT THESE

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:02.671
BASIC NEEDS CENTERS ARE SO KEY

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:04.339
AYE AYE AYE COUPLE YEARS AGO I

01:14:04.406 --> 01:14:05.607
PUT MY IN THE BUDGET TO FIND

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.342
ONE HERE AT SACRAMENTO CITY

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:10.379
COLLEGE- KIND OF ANNOYED THAT I

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:11.146
GIVE TO ENOUGH MONEY IN DOLLARS

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:12.481
IT'S NOT DONE YET TWO YEARS

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:14.550
LATER SO CHANCES OFFICE MAKE

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:16.618
SURE. YOU CAN TALK TO OUR LOCAL

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:18.687
SERRET LOS RIOS TO GET ON IT

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:20.722
BUT THE ISSUE THOUGH IS THAT

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:22.324
STUDENTS THERE'S NOT DATE

01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:23.625
SOMETIMES AS A MENU OF THINGS

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:24.893
THEY HAVE CHALLENGES WITH STUFF

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.895
THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:29.131
RAPID RE HOUSING LEADING UP TO

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:31.433
SIGN UP FOR CALFRESH OR HEALTH

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.135
CARE OR OTHER ISSUES AND SO.

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:35.737
HAVING SOMETHING THAT'S ONGOING

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:39.208
OR AFP THAT'S IN A KEY ON THE

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:40.475
CAMPUS. WHERE STUDENTS AN GO I

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:42.177
THINK IS THE KEY YOU KNOW WE

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:43.946
TALK ABOUT WE SPENT AN HOUR TWO

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.514
WEEKS AGO TALKING ABOUT CALPERS

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.583
SO BY DEFINITION. MOST OF THE

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:48.584
STUDENTS ARE VERY VERY LOW

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:50.786
INCOME AND CALFRESH IS SUPPOSED

01:14:50.853 --> 01:14:52.955
TO BY DEFINITION. PROVIDE FOOD

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:54.756
FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE BUT- IT'S

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:55.724
HARD TO LINK THOSE TWO THINGS

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.726
TOGETHER SO. HAVING THESE BASIC

01:14:57.793 --> 01:15:00.696
NEEDS CENTERS ON. CAMPUS IS A

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:02.130
PLACE TO GO THAT ARE.

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:03.932
ADEQUATELY STAFF THAT HAVE

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:06.401
HOURS AVAILABLE OR- THAT YOU

01:15:06.468 --> 01:15:07.636
HAVE PEOPLE YOU CAN CALL

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:09.271
ENTERED YOU HAVE AN APP OR WHAT

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:10.873
HAVE YOU SO. CAN STUDENTS CAN

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:13.675
ENGAGE. I THINK IS A IS IT IS

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:16.144
AN IDEA THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.747
BECAUSE- IT'S BRIDGING THIS FOR

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:20.182
SERVICES IN THE STUDENTS WHICH

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:21.884
IS THE KEY AND OTHERWISE IF YOU

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:24.119
JUST HAVE THESE. ON OVER HERE

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:24.653
OVER HERE AND HERE AND YOU

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.855
DON'T CONNECT. IT'S NOT ALWAYS

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:29.758
GOING TO WORK- THOSE ARE MY

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:30.626
KIND OF MY THOUGHT THAT WE'RE

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:31.960
GONNA BE LOOKING AT AS WE CLOSE

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:33.161
OUT THIS YEAR'S THIS YEAR'S

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.030
BUDGET SO. QUESTIONS COMMENTS

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:37.366
BY MEMBERS ON THIS ASSEMBLY

01:15:37.432 --> 01:15:38.700
MEMBER IT. JUST WANT TO

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:40.903
ABSOLUTELY WORTH MY DREAM IT

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.004
WITH YOU ON THAT I THINK THAT

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:45.040
THESE BASIC NEED BLOCK GRANTS.

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:47.309
ARE ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD IDEA

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:51.446
YEAH AND- PROVIDING THE- WHAT

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:53.682
THE DISTRICTS NEED- TO MAKE THE

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:55.183
DECISIONS BASED ON THE NEEDS OF

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.552
THEIR STUDENTS- I LIKE THE IDEA

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:59.621
OF YOUR BASIC NEEDS CENTERS AND

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:01.323
I HOPE THAT. THE FUNDING CAN BE

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:02.658
PROVIDED ALSO FOR SAMPOERNA

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:04.293
DINO VALLEY COLLEGE AND SOME OF

01:16:04.359 --> 01:16:06.962
OUR OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES- I

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:08.297
THINK THAT THE IDEA IS GREAT I

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:09.131
THINK THAT WITH THE BASIC

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:11.533
NEEDS. BLOCK GRANTS HAVING

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.002
STATE OBJECTIVES AND REPORTING-

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.370
ON THE OBJECTIVES WOULD BE

01:16:15.437 --> 01:16:17.572
IMPORTANT SO IN THE END WE GET

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:18.607
TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.809
PROPOSING. BUT WE ALLOW IT TO

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:22.577
BE DONE AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:23.545
BECAUSE THEY WILL BE IN A

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:25.013
BETTER POSITION TO DETERMINE.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.848
WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AND HOW IT

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.450
SHOULD BE DIVIDED I AGREE WITH

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:30.118
YOU WITH THE CHAIR THAT PUTTING

01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:31.787
MENTAL HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:33.889
AND ONE GROUP. JUST DIDN'T MAKE

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:38.493
ANY SENSE BUT- HAVING A BLOCK

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.127
GRANT I THINK IT'S JUST A GREAT

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:41.029
IDEA. SEVEN REVISED THAT

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:44.299
ESTIMATE TO MEDINA- I CONCUR

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:45.467
WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT I THINK

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:47.536
THAT THE BLOCK GRANT APPROACH

01:16:47.602 --> 01:16:49.304
IS- IS REALLY WHAT'S BEST FOR

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:50.572
OUR DISTRICTS ARE HOME

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:51.707
DISTRICTS AND GIVING THEM THE

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.742
FLEXIBILITY JUST TO CLARIFY

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:54.443
THOUGH SO BOTH THE

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:56.244
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:58.981

DID WITHIN THE TEAMSTERS OFFICE

01:18:37.145 --> 01:18:38.880

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:17.599
ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE AND THEY

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:19.100
DON'T LIKE. AND THEY FIND THAT

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:20.435
PERHAPS WORKING WITH THEIR

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:21.002

THE CRISIS OF COLLEGE

01:49:24.357 --> 01:49:24.791
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:27.761
QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. OKAY

01:49:27.827 --> 01:49:31.398
STERN MEDINA I COULDN'T AGREE

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:33.600
MORE WITH EVERYTHING THAT

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:37.237
YOU'VE SAID- IN MY THIRTEEN

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:37.971
YEARS AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:49:38.038 --> 01:49:40.006
TRUSTEE I SAW THAT THE BIGGEST

01:49:40.073 --> 01:49:42.642
REASON WHY COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:46.880
STUDENTS DIDN'T FINISH- FINISH

01:49:46.947 --> 01:49:48.982
AT ALL OR FINISH SOONER WAS

01:49:49.049 --> 01:49:51.051
BECAUSE LIFE GOT IN THE WAY.

01:49:51.117 --> 01:49:52.786
ANOTHER WAY TO SAY THAT IS THAT

01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:54.521
THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS

01:49:54.587 --> 01:49:56.589
HAVE THE NEED TO WORK. WHICH IS

01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:59.726
NOT. REAL CONDUCIVE TO

01:49:59.793 --> 01:50:03.129
FINISHING COLLEGE- AND SO I

01:50:03.196 --> 01:50:04.764
THINK THAT THE CAL GRANT REFORM

01:50:04.831 --> 01:50:07.033
THAT WE'RE DOING- IS WAY

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:09.903

SPEED RAIL I WILL TO DEFEND IT

02:09:53.285 --> 02:09:54.453
BECAUSE HIGH SPEED RAIL AT

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:56.722
LEAST IS FILLING A VOID A

02:09:56.788 --> 02:09:58.657
UNIQUE NEED THAT DOES NOT EXIST

02:09:58.724 --> 02:10:00.726
CURRENTLY. WOULD GIVE YOU THAT

02:10:00.792 --> 02:10:02.060
NOW THEY ARE THERE BUT THE

02:10:02.127 --> 02:10:04.763
ONLINE EDUCATION AS WE HAVE ALL

02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:06.899
DISCOVER UNIVERSALLY HAN BE

02:10:06.965 --> 02:10:08.667
DONE BY OTHER NEED OR CAN BE

02:10:08.734 --> 02:10:10.402
FILLED BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:13.605
AND EVEN WHEN I WAS A STAFFER I

02:10:13.672 --> 02:10:14.173
REMEMBERED THE COR ARGUMENT

02:10:14.239 --> 02:10:15.374
BEING. WHY IS THIS SOMETHING

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:16.708
THAT ARE CAN YOU COLLEGES COULD

02:10:16.775 --> 02:10:17.776
NOT OFFER ON THEIR OWN RIGHT

02:10:17.843 --> 02:10:19.511
NOW. WELL WE GOT THE ANSWER NOW

02:10:19.578 --> 02:10:20.145
DURING THE PANDEMIC

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:21.580
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS SOMETHING

02:10:21.647 --> 02:10:22.981
THEY CAN OFFER ON THEIR OWN.

02:10:23.048 --> 02:10:24.583
AND THEY ARE DOING IT AND I AM

02:10:24.650 --> 02:10:25.417
A FIRM BELIEVER THAT OUR

02:10:25.484 --> 02:10:26.418
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE

02:10:26.485 --> 02:10:28.020
EFFECTIVE OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:10:28.086 --> 02:10:29.521
AND THAT'S WHY FRANKLY A LOT OF

02:10:29.588 --> 02:10:30.923
OUR- COMMUNITY RETURN TO THE

02:10:30.989 --> 02:10:32.024
SCHOOLS WHEN THEY NEED

02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:33.025
EDUCATION AND I DO FIRMLY

02:10:33.091 --> 02:10:34.960
BELIEVE. THERE IS A PLACE FOR

02:10:35.027 --> 02:10:35.928
REMOTE DISTANCE LEARNING OR

02:10:35.994 --> 02:10:37.396
ONLINE EDUCATION FOR PEOPLE

02:10:37.462 --> 02:10:38.897
THAT NEED IN THEIR LIVES I

02:10:38.964 --> 02:10:40.265
THINK THERE IS THAT NEED. BUT I

02:10:40.332 --> 02:10:42.134
AM ALSO SKEPTICAL THAT WE NEED

02:10:42.201 --> 02:10:43.936
TO INVEST THE- HUNDREDS OF

02:10:44.002 --> 02:10:44.937
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THE

02:10:45.003 --> 02:10:46.104
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. INTO

02:10:46.171 --> 02:10:47.372
REPLICATING SOMETHING THAT WE

02:10:47.439 --> 02:10:49.441
NOW ARE DEMONSTRATING TO EXIST

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:52.344
IN REAL LIFE- SO THAT'S WHY I.

02:10:52.411 --> 02:10:53.512
REMAIN VERY SKEPTICAL OF IT AS

02:10:53.579 --> 02:10:55.614
WELL. I AND I DO BELIEVE STILL

02:10:55.681 --> 02:10:58.617
THAT. AS OUR EDUCATORS AND OUR

02:10:58.684 --> 02:10:59.718
CHECKING ME COLLEGES HAD BEEN

02:10:59.785 --> 02:11:02.154
EXPRESSING TO US SINCE TWENTY

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:02.955
EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THAT

02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:04.590
THEY CAN'T DO IT AND THEY ARE

02:11:04.656 --> 02:11:05.190
DEMONSTRATING THAT YOU CAN DO

02:11:05.257 --> 02:11:08.093
IT- BUT MY QUESTION. RIGHT NOW

02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:10.262
TO EXACT DIRECTOR IS GIVEN ALL

02:11:10.329 --> 02:11:11.296
WE KNOW ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:14.433
NOW. AND THAT ALL THE COMING

02:11:14.499 --> 02:11:16.101
COLLEGES HAVE THIS. A POTENTIAL

02:11:16.168 --> 02:11:17.402
TO DO REMOTE DISTANCE LEARNING.

02:11:17.469 --> 02:11:18.870
ACTUALLY FUNNY ENOUGH USUALLY

02:11:18.937 --> 02:11:20.572
IN OUR HEARINGS I ASK THE-

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.140

IN THIS CASE THERE WILL. BE NO

02:11:24.476 --> 02:11:26.111
QUESTION OF THAT SORT. BUT MY

02:11:26.178 --> 02:11:27.079

DISTANCE LEARNING NOW AND THE

02:11:29.248 --> 02:11:31.183
REAL REALITY. THAT ALL COMING

02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:32.751
COLLEGES CAN OFFER. THESE

02:11:32.818 --> 02:11:34.119
PROGRAMS AND YOU ALLUDED TO

02:11:34.186 --> 02:11:35.120

02:11:50.736 --> 02:11:52.838
BECAUSE IT'S BUILT. FOR THE

02:11:52.904 --> 02:11:54.439
CHALLENGES. NOT WORKING

02:11:54.506 --> 02:11:56.508
LEARNERS ARE FACING TODAY AND

02:11:56.575 --> 02:11:58.443
IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DISTINCT

02:11:58.510 --> 02:12:00.145
MODEL FROM WHAT WE SEE AND

02:12:00.212 --> 02:12:01.913
CONVENTIONAL ONLINE EDUCATION

02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:04.883
THAT IS GREAT WORK THAT MANY OF

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:06.718
OUR SYSTEM COLLEGES ARE DOING-

02:12:06.785 --> 02:12:08.987
IN PARTICULAR AT HI I JUST WANT

02:12:09.054 --> 02:12:10.422
TO SAY I DON'T CONSIDER OUR

02:12:10.489 --> 02:12:11.857
COLLEGE TO BE SEPARATE AND

02:12:11.923 --> 02:12:13.091
APART FROM THE SYSTEM. I

02:12:13.158 --> 02:12:16.094
CONSIDER US TO BE A PART OF-

02:12:16.161 --> 02:12:18.430
THAT. GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS

02:12:18.497 --> 02:12:20.032
THAT ARE ALL STRIVING TO DO

02:12:20.098 --> 02:12:21.867
THIS WORK- TO SERVICE

02:12:21.933 --> 02:12:23.001
POPULATION OF LEARNERS BETTER

02:12:23.068 --> 02:12:24.102
BUT WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE

02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:25.504
LEARNED FROM OUR RESEARCH AND

02:12:25.570 --> 02:12:26.538
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM PAST

02:12:26.605 --> 02:12:28.073
RECESSIONARY PERIODS. AND WHAT

02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:28.740
I'VE LEARNED OVER THE COURSE OF

02:12:28.807 --> 02:12:30.742
MY CAREER IS WE HAVE TO FIND

02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:32.711
NEW WAYS OF DOING IT EVEN AN

02:12:32.778 --> 02:12:34.880
ONLINE NOT JUST ABOUT ONLINE

02:12:34.946 --> 02:12:36.348
FOR THESE LEARNERS IT IS ALSO

02:12:36.415 --> 02:12:38.450
ABOUT NOT HAVING A TURN BASED

02:12:38.517 --> 02:12:39.918
PROGRAM THAT IS ON AN ACADEMIC

02:12:39.985 --> 02:12:42.087
CALENDAR. ONE THAT IS FLEXIBLE

02:12:42.154 --> 02:12:43.955
AND SELF PACED AS OUR PROGRAMS

02:12:44.022 --> 02:12:45.657
ARE IN ONE THAT IS ABOUT

02:12:45.724 --> 02:12:47.092
GETTING THEM NOT JUST THE

02:12:47.159 --> 02:12:48.694
TECHNICAL SKILLS BUT THE

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.162
CONTEXTUAL SKILLS THAT THEY

02:12:50.228 --> 02:12:52.964
NEED IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL

02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:55.000
IN THE WORKPLACE. MOST OF WHAT

02:12:55.067 --> 02:12:57.269
WE DO IN CONVENTIONAL EDUCATION

02:12:57.336 --> 02:12:58.670
WHETHER IT'S DELIVERED ONLINE

02:12:58.737 --> 02:13:00.605
OR WHETHER IT'S DELIVERED IN AN

02:13:00.672 --> 02:13:02.341
IN PERSON SETTING IS HANNAH

02:13:02.407 --> 02:13:05.811
HUSBAND OVER TIME TO ADDRESS

02:13:05.877 --> 02:13:07.612
THE NEEDS OF A VERY TRADITIONAL

02:13:07.679 --> 02:13:09.047
AGE POPULATION AND WHAT WE'RE

02:13:09.114 --> 02:13:10.916
SEEKING TO DO HERE. IS TO

02:13:10.982 --> 02:13:13.118
INTRODUCE A BEST IN CLASS

02:13:13.185 --> 02:13:14.019
VERSION OF COMPETENCY BASED

02:13:14.086 --> 02:13:15.721
EDUCATION THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:13:15.787 --> 02:13:17.189
WOULD LOVE TO SEE EXPANDED IN

02:13:17.255 --> 02:13:18.657
THE SYSTEM AND I KNOW IT'S A

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:20.125
SHARED SYSTEM GOAL THAT WE

02:13:20.192 --> 02:13:22.728
HAVE- BUT CREATING THE SPACE

02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:23.895
FOR THAT ARE AND HE WORKED TO

02:13:23.962 --> 02:13:26.131
OCCUR. IN WAYS THAT ALSO

02:13:26.198 --> 02:13:27.966
BENEFIT REAL LEARNERS BUT ALSO

02:13:28.033 --> 02:13:31.303
THEN CONNECTS TO- TO CONNECT TO

02:13:31.370 --> 02:13:32.371
THIS BROADER WORK THAT THAT THE

02:13:32.437 --> 02:13:34.106
SYSTEM IN MY SYSTEM COLLEAGUES

02:13:34.172 --> 02:13:35.941
ARE DOING IS IMPORTANT. I JUST

02:13:36.007 --> 02:13:37.175
ALSO WANTED TO SAY THAT YOU

02:13:37.242 --> 02:13:37.943
HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF

02:13:38.009 --> 02:13:39.678
CONVERSATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES

02:13:39.745 --> 02:13:41.580
IN THE SYSTEM AND I AND I KNOW

02:13:41.646 --> 02:13:42.981
THAT WERE IN THIS WORK TOGETHER

02:13:43.048 --> 02:13:44.583
THEY SIMILARLY SEE THAT THREAT

02:13:44.649 --> 02:13:45.650
COMING FROM THE FOR PROFIT

02:13:45.717 --> 02:13:47.586
COLLEGE PROVIDERS. WE ARE

02:13:47.652 --> 02:13:49.054
OPERATING IN A VACUUM THIS IS

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:50.722
THE EXACT POPULATION THAT WE

02:13:50.789 --> 02:13:57.095
HAVE SEEN BEING TARGETED. WE

02:13:57.162 --> 02:13:57.629
HAVEN'T HAD IN THE PUBLIC

02:13:57.696 --> 02:13:58.730
SECTOR- FLEXIBLE OPTIONS

02:13:58.797 --> 02:14:00.465
OPTIONS THAT SELF PAY ACTION

02:14:00.532 --> 02:14:02.667
THAT CAN. THIS AND THE ON

02:14:02.734 --> 02:14:04.302
PRESIDENT PRESSURE AND DEMAND.

02:14:04.369 --> 02:14:04.903
THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE

02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:05.537
PROJECT. WHEN WITH CARE GETTING

02:14:05.604 --> 02:14:08.039
WORSE. ARE FOR. SO ME IT'S NOT

02:14:08.106 --> 02:14:10.709
OR THE A YES AND THE IMPORTANCE

02:14:10.776 --> 02:14:11.777
OF DOING THIS WORK AS

02:14:11.843 --> 02:14:13.545
ENVISIONED. THE STATUTE IN THAT

02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:14.980
COLLABORATIVE PLAY IS A CORE

02:14:15.046 --> 02:14:17.149
PART OF HOW WE ACCOMPLISH THAT

02:14:17.215 --> 02:14:18.517
AND I'D LOVE FIFTY ONE CONCRETE

02:14:18.583 --> 02:14:20.419
EXAMPLE OF. OF THIS THAT WITH

02:14:20.485 --> 02:14:21.486
RESPECT TO THE SYSTEM WIDE

02:14:21.553 --> 02:14:23.188
APPLICATION. WE MIGHT THINK

02:14:23.255 --> 02:14:24.556
THAT ACTUALLY THE SYSTEM WIDE

02:14:24.623 --> 02:14:26.558
APPLICATION HAS VERY LITTLE TO

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:29.227
DO. WITH WHAT HAPPENS IS ON THE

02:14:29.294 --> 02:14:30.629
ENROLLMENT SIDE WHAT HAPPENS IN

02:14:30.695 --> 02:14:32.330
TERMS OF STUDENT SUCCESS. BUT

02:14:32.397 --> 02:14:33.432
ACTUALLY WHAT WE FOUND WAS

02:14:33.498 --> 02:14:34.633
BECAUSE WE WERE UNIQUELY

02:14:34.699 --> 02:14:36.168
COLLECTING DATA ON OUR LEARNERS

02:14:36.234 --> 02:14:37.335
THAT WERE GOING THROUGH THE

02:14:37.402 --> 02:14:39.104
APPLICATION PROCESS. THAT IT

02:14:39.171 --> 02:14:40.605
HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT

02:14:40.672 --> 02:14:41.907
ON AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS

02:14:41.973 --> 02:14:43.842
AND ADULTS STUDENTS. WILL BE

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:45.510
THEN SUGGESTED KEY CHANGES THAT

02:14:45.577 --> 02:14:46.878
CAN BENEFIT THE SYSTEM WIDE

02:14:46.945 --> 02:14:48.013
APPLICATION FOR THOSE

02:14:48.079 --> 02:14:49.781
COMMUNITIES OF LEARNERS. AND

02:14:49.848 --> 02:14:51.683
THOSE KINDS OF CHANGES ARE ONES

02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:53.318
THAT BENEFIT PAIN POINTS THAT

02:14:53.385 --> 02:14:54.886
THE SYSTEM SEES AS A WHOLE. AND

02:14:54.953 --> 02:14:56.021
WITH EVERY THINK ABOUT HOW TO

02:14:56.087 --> 02:14:58.190
SUPPORT ALL OF US TO REBOUND

02:14:58.256 --> 02:14:59.825
ARE ENROLLMENTS AGAINST THIS

02:14:59.891 --> 02:15:04.396
COMPETING. PRESSURE FROM FOR

02:15:04.463 --> 02:15:05.730
PROFIT COLLEGES. THAT WE ACT

02:15:05.797 --> 02:15:07.032
MORE AND MORE EMPHASIS. AND WE

02:15:07.098 --> 02:15:07.866
WORK TO IN A WAY THAT IT. WHAT

02:15:07.933 --> 02:15:09.267
EACH OF US IS DOING FIRST FOR

02:15:09.334 --> 02:15:10.836
WHAT EACH OF US IS DOING. BUT

02:15:10.902 --> 02:15:12.404
THAT'S SOME OF THE PROBLEMS NOT

02:15:12.471 --> 02:15:13.638
A SINGLE INSTITUTION CAN SOLVE

02:15:13.705 --> 02:15:21.780
ON THEIR OWN. BUT I THINK THAT

02:15:21.847 --> 02:15:24.349
ON. THAT REALLY ADDRESSES THE

02:15:24.416 --> 02:15:26.251
ISSUE IS THAT. THERE IS GREAT.

02:15:26.318 --> 02:15:28.987
PROMISE HERE. BUT IT'S JUST NOT

02:15:29.054 --> 02:15:31.156
BEING. MATERIALIZED IN AND YOU

02:15:31.223 --> 02:15:32.357
WOULD THINK DURING. THE

02:15:32.424 --> 02:15:34.893
PANDEMIC WHEN. OPPORTUNITIES

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:37.496
FOR THIS IS. IS THE GREATEST

02:15:37.562 --> 02:15:38.129
THERE'D BE A BIG SUCCESS THAT'S

02:15:38.196 --> 02:15:40.932
NOT AND- YOU KNOW WHEN THIS WAS

02:15:40.999 --> 02:15:42.701
CREATED AND I KNOWS BEFORE YOUR

02:15:42.767 --> 02:15:44.536
YOUR YOUR TIME THERE WAS

02:15:44.603 --> 02:15:46.838
PROMISE THAT- SEIU AND- THEIR

02:15:46.905 --> 02:15:49.774
MEMBERS HAVE GREAT INTEREST IN.

02:15:49.841 --> 02:15:51.943
CAN CODING IN THE CAREER LADDER

02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:53.979
AND THAT JUST FIZZLED OUT AND-

02:15:54.045 --> 02:15:55.680
JUST THE PROMISED THESE PIECES

02:15:55.747 --> 02:15:57.883
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND I

02:15:57.949 --> 02:15:59.017
CAN CURRENT I DON'T WANT TO

02:15:59.084 --> 02:16:00.552
JUST MAKE THIS UNCOMFORTABLE

02:16:00.619 --> 02:16:01.686
AND UGLY BUT THE TRUTH IS IT IS

02:16:01.753 --> 02:16:03.989
WHAT IT IS. AND I KNOW YOUR

02:16:04.055 --> 02:16:07.092
NEW- IN THIS POSITION AND SO

02:16:07.158 --> 02:16:09.361
YOU KNOW I HAVE GREAT RESPECT

02:16:09.427 --> 02:16:09.928
FOR YOUR WORK WITH THE OBAMA

02:16:09.995 --> 02:16:12.297
ADMINISTRATION AND- AND HIGHER

02:16:12.364 --> 02:16:13.265
EDUCATION IN OUR COMMUNITY

02:16:13.331 --> 02:16:15.867
COLLEGES- BUT TO KNOW THAT YOU

02:16:15.934 --> 02:16:17.402
TAKE YOU THANKED US FOR THE

02:16:17.469 --> 02:16:19.204
SUPPORT AND I'LL BE HONEST

02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:20.272
THERE IS NO SUPPORT THERE IS

02:16:20.338 --> 02:16:22.274
ONE. LAWMAKER WHO SUPPORTED

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:24.009
THIS AND THAT LAWMAKER DIDN'T

02:16:24.075 --> 02:16:26.077
MAKE THIS SURVIVE. IT WAS THE

02:16:26.144 --> 02:16:27.779
GOVERNOR AND THE PRIOR GOVERNOR

02:16:27.846 --> 02:16:29.681
WHO FOREVER REASONS. HAVE THE

02:16:29.748 --> 02:16:31.049
SHINY OBJECT IN THE CORNER

02:16:31.116 --> 02:16:33.552
THINK THIS IS GONNA MATERIALIZE

02:16:33.618 --> 02:16:35.186
BUT IT'S NOT SO THERE IS

02:16:35.253 --> 02:16:38.857
NINETY. 8% DISAPPROVAL FROM THE

02:16:38.924 --> 02:16:40.759
LEGISLATURE FOR THIS SO. YOU

02:16:40.825 --> 02:16:43.194
HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE I

02:16:43.261 --> 02:16:44.095
KNOW THAT THERE'S AN AUDIT

02:16:44.162 --> 02:16:45.931
COMING OUT. I'M NOT SURE HOW

02:16:45.997 --> 02:16:47.065
IT'S GOING TO IMPROVE THE

02:16:47.132 --> 02:16:49.467
STANDING BECAUSE THE FACTS ARE

02:16:49.534 --> 02:16:51.770
ARE WHAT THEY WERE- I JUST WANT

02:16:51.836 --> 02:16:55.273
TO ASK YOU JUST A FEW A FEW.

02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:57.242
QUESTIONS- ONE OF THE THINGS

02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:58.510
THAT I FIVE FIND REALLY

02:16:58.577 --> 02:17:01.846
INTRIGUING IS THAT- CAL BRAT

02:17:01.913 --> 02:17:04.115
CALIBRATE PLANS TO SPEND. UP

02:17:04.182 --> 02:17:04.916
TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR

02:17:04.983 --> 02:17:06.985
PARTNERSHIPS WITH PLACE BASED

02:17:07.052 --> 02:17:08.553
AGENCIES SUCH AS COMMUNITY

02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:10.989
COLLEGES LIBRARIES. JOB

02:17:11.056 --> 02:17:16.995
CENTERS- TO HELP FACILITATE IN

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:18.430
PERSON SUPPORT OF CALIBRATE

02:17:18.496 --> 02:17:19.965
STUDENTS THAT DOESN'T THIS

02:17:20.031 --> 02:17:22.267
NEGATE THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF CAL

02:17:22.334 --> 02:17:25.303
THE CALIBRATE YOU KNOW. WHAT'S

02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:27.639
THE POINT OF CALIBRATE. OF THIS

02:17:27.706 --> 02:17:29.608
IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THINK

02:17:29.674 --> 02:17:30.141
THAT UNDERMINES THE WHOLE

02:17:30.208 --> 02:17:33.378
EFFORT. I THINK WHEN THE STATUE

02:17:33.445 --> 02:17:35.180
WAS FIRST CREATED IT ENVISIONED

02:17:35.246 --> 02:17:37.182
OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLABORATIVE

02:17:37.248 --> 02:17:39.284
PARTNERSHIPS TO OCCUR AT THAT

02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:41.286
WERE BASED IN COMMUNITY AND-

02:17:41.353 --> 02:17:43.088
THAT IS NOT ABOUT US SETTING UP

02:17:43.154 --> 02:17:44.856
STOCK IN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT

02:17:44.923 --> 02:17:45.957
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE

02:17:46.024 --> 02:17:47.726
BUT IT'S REALLY AROUND. AND

02:17:47.792 --> 02:17:50.128
ENSURING THAT WE ARE TECHNOLOGY

02:17:50.195 --> 02:17:51.896
AND I AND OUR WORK PRESENTS AN

02:17:51.963 --> 02:17:53.098
IMPORTANT CONNECTOR TO THIS

02:17:53.164 --> 02:17:54.833
INSTITUTION AND A GOOD EXAMPLE

02:17:54.899 --> 02:17:55.800
OF THIS IS ACTUALLY THE WORK

02:17:55.867 --> 02:17:57.168
THAT WE'RE DOING IN COMPTON

02:17:57.235 --> 02:17:59.738
COLLEGE RIGHT NOW. SO COMPTON

02:17:59.804 --> 02:18:01.740
COLLEGES LEADERSHIP. RECOGNIZE

02:18:01.806 --> 02:18:02.540
THAT THERE WAS A CHALLENGE THAT

02:18:02.607 --> 02:18:04.542
THEY WERE EXPERIENCING WITH IN

02:18:04.609 --> 02:18:05.877
PERSON SERVICES PRADA DEALT

02:18:05.944 --> 02:18:08.380
BASIC EDUCATION AND ADULT BASIC

02:18:08.446 --> 02:18:09.948
RULES AND THAT THEY WERE ABLE

02:18:10.015 --> 02:18:11.449
TO ACTUALLY CONVERT THAT INTO

02:18:11.516 --> 02:18:13.785
COLLEGE GOING INVOLVEMENTS AND

02:18:13.852 --> 02:18:15.320
THEY SAW AND SEE. A ROLE FOR

02:18:15.387 --> 02:18:17.288
CALIBRATE IN THE PROGRAMS THAT

02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:18.490
WE HAVE IN ADDRESSING THE

02:18:18.556 --> 02:18:20.125
LEARNER NEEDS IN THE WAY WE DO

02:18:20.191 --> 02:18:21.459
WHICH IS NOT JUST THROUGH THE

02:18:21.526 --> 02:18:23.028
SOUTHEAST MODELED BY OUR

02:18:23.094 --> 02:18:25.430
FACULTY WORK ACROSS SILOS VERY

02:18:25.497 --> 02:18:26.998
TYPICAL OF AN INSTITUTION TO

02:18:27.065 --> 02:18:28.133
PROTECT PRESENT THE INTEGRATED

02:18:28.199 --> 02:18:30.468
SUPPORT MODEL. FOR SERVICES AND

FRUSTRATING FOR US AS YOU KNOW.

02:19:54.119 --> 02:19:55.854
PRIOR WE LEARNED THAT THAT MOST

OF THE CALIBRATE STUDENTS WERE

02:19:57.222 --> 02:19:58.656

02:20:17.776 --> 02:20:20.145
SPECIFICS WE'VE ACTUALLY- FADE

02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:21.880
OUT THE ESSENTIALS PROGRAM AND

02:20:21.946 --> 02:20:23.281
WE HELPED MIGRATE THE STUDENTS

THEIR SKILLS COURSEWORK AND SO

02:20:28.386 --> 02:20:30.221
WHAT WE RECOGNIZED WITH EXACTLY

02:20:30.288 --> 02:20:31.189
WHAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THERE

02:20:31.256 --> 02:20:32.290
WAS THE CHALLENGE THAT STUDENTS

ARE EXPERIENCING. IN THAT

02:20:34.192 --> 02:20:35.426
INTRODUCTORY COURSE THAT THE

02:20:35.493 --> 02:20:36.628
SEQUENCING OF THAT COURSE IS

02:20:36.694 --> 02:20:37.295
THE DESIGN OF THAT PROGRAM

02:20:37.362 --> 02:20:38.863
DIDN'T WORK SO IN A VERY SHORT

02:20:38.930 --> 02:20:39.798
AMOUNT OF TIME IN A MATTER OF

02:20:39.864 --> 02:20:40.832
MONTHS NOT A TWO YEAR

02:20:40.899 --> 02:20:42.200
CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

02:20:42.267 --> 02:20:43.902
BUT A SHORTER. CLAPPED OUT WE

02:20:43.968 --> 02:20:45.937
WERE ABLE TO NOT JUST IDENTIFY

02:20:46.004 --> 02:20:47.005
THAT CONCERN BUT MAKE THE

02:20:47.071 --> 02:20:49.707
CHANGES. ORDER TO ENSURE THAT

SOFT AN ESSENTIAL SKILLS THAT

02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:53.444

02:20:53.511 --> 02:20:55.814
BE INTEGRATED WITH THEIR SKILLS

02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:57.182
AT WORK THAT THEY WERE DOING

02:20:57.248 --> 02:20:58.683
AND SO WHAT YOU'LL SEE. ALSO IN

02:20:58.750 --> 02:21:01.586
PROGRAMS GOING FORWARD- IS NOT

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:03.621

FOR THE FACT THAT WHAT WE NEED

02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:53.918
TO HONOR IT'S NOT JUST OUR

02:24:53.985 --> 02:24:55.453
EXPECTATIONS AROUND COMPLETIONS

02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:57.522
BUT IN IN TERMS OF. BEING

02:24:57.588 --> 02:24:58.823
CLOSELY ATTUNED TO WHAT'S

02:24:58.890 --> 02:24:59.991
HAPPENING TO OUR LEARNERS

02:25:00.058 --> 02:25:01.692
THEMSELVES THAT WHAT'S UNIQUE

02:25:01.759 --> 02:25:03.027
ABOUT OUR MODEL IS THAT IT'S

02:25:03.094 --> 02:25:05.763
NOT SPENT THE STATE IN A TERM

02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:07.899
WITH THE SEMESTER- IF YOU HAVE

02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:08.633
TWO WEEKS WHERE YOU HAVE TO

02:25:08.699 --> 02:25:09.901
TAKE CARE OF A SICK CHILD OR

02:25:09.967 --> 02:25:12.703
YOU HAVE TO. CARE FOR A IN

02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:14.005
EARLY FAMILY MEMBER OR YOU

02:25:14.072 --> 02:25:15.373
YOURSELF GET SICK THAT THAT

02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:16.707
OPPORTUNITY AND THAT

02:25:16.774 --> 02:25:18.810
FLEXIBILITY AT ALLOW SOMEBODY

02:25:18.876 --> 02:25:20.745
TO MOVE IT THEIR SELF HE'S FAT

02:25:20.812 --> 02:25:22.280
AND I AND OUR GOAL IS AND OUR

02:25:22.346 --> 02:25:29.854
JOB IS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:25:29.921 --> 02:25:30.755
ARE SUPPORTING THEM- TO FIND

02:25:30.822 --> 02:25:32.990
GOAL THAT WE HELP THEM. AND

02:25:33.057 --> 02:25:34.892
THEN LAW I SOME OF THEM MEMBERS

02:25:34.959 --> 02:25:37.628
MASSIVE TO ASK I'M JUST LOOKING

02:25:37.695 --> 02:25:39.530
FOR CONCRETE EVIDENCE THAT.

02:25:39.597 --> 02:25:42.834
THIS WILL BE A SUCCESS FOR OUR

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:46.070
PARTICIPANTS AND AT CREDIBLE.

02:25:46.137 --> 02:25:47.872
REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S

02:25:47.939 --> 02:25:48.439
GOING TO BE THE CASE IN THE

02:25:48.506 --> 02:25:51.709
NEAR FUTURE- BECAUSE- TO US SO

02:25:51.776 --> 02:25:53.444
FAR IT'S IT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:54.645
ABLE TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS A REAL

02:25:54.712 --> 02:25:57.148
VALUE. WITH COMPLETION RATES

02:25:57.215 --> 02:25:59.183
AND JOB PLACEMENT RATES. AND

02:25:59.250 --> 02:26:01.752
THE TARGET HERE LOW WAGE

02:26:01.819 --> 02:26:04.655
WORKERS PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND

02:26:04.722 --> 02:26:07.091
CONCERNED THAT IF IT IF WE FAIL

02:26:07.158 --> 02:26:09.227
THEN THEY'LL JUST WORSENED. OUR

02:26:09.293 --> 02:26:11.095
OUR RACIAL INEQUITIES IN INCOME

02:26:11.162 --> 02:26:13.564
ACROSS CALIFORNIA. CALIBRATES

02:26:13.631 --> 02:26:15.133
HAVING THAT IS UNACCREDITED AND

02:26:15.199 --> 02:26:16.234
HAVING A HARD TIME CONVINCING

02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:21.205
STUDENTS TO ENROLL. SO AGAIN.

02:26:21.272 --> 02:26:23.207
WHERE IS THE CONCRETE EVIDENCE.

02:26:23.274 --> 02:26:24.942
THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO SUCCESS

02:26:25.009 --> 02:26:28.646
FOR PARTICIPANTS. YES WE HAVE

02:26:28.713 --> 02:26:29.981
BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL OF

02:26:30.047 --> 02:26:31.582
TRANSLATING THE LEARNINGS THAT

02:26:31.649 --> 02:26:33.251
WE HAD FROM THE EARLY PROGRAM

02:26:33.317 --> 02:26:35.653
PATHWAYS INTO THE INTO THE

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:37.421
POSITIVE CHANGES THAT WILL

02:26:37.488 --> 02:26:38.923
CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY FOR OUR

02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:41.792
STUDENTS OUT WE ARE ALSO AND I

02:26:41.859 --> 02:26:42.793
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU

02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.128
RAISE THE ISSUE OF A CONVICTION

02:26:44.195 --> 02:26:45.363
HAVING SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON

02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:47.231
THE FEDERAL SIDE. YOU KNOW

02:26:47.298 --> 02:26:48.633
AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY AND

02:26:48.699 --> 02:26:50.568
FOCUSED ON QUALITY ASSURANCE AT

02:26:50.635 --> 02:26:51.536
THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND WHAT

02:26:51.602 --> 02:26:53.237
INSTITUTIONS ARE DOING THERE I

02:26:53.304 --> 02:26:54.805
TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY

02:26:54.872 --> 02:26:56.674
ACCREDITATION IS A PROCESS THAT

02:26:56.741 --> 02:26:58.075
WE ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW

02:26:58.142 --> 02:26:59.177
WE ARE ACTUALLY AHEAD OF

02:26:59.243 --> 02:27:01.245
SCHEDULE IN TERMS OF SUBMITTING

02:27:01.312 --> 02:27:03.014
OUR APPLICATION AND MOVING

02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:03.881
THROUGH THE PROCESS TO GET

02:27:03.948 --> 02:27:07.652
ACCREDITED- AS WELL AS- WELL

02:27:07.718 --> 02:27:08.286
CONCURRENT PROCESS BY WHICH WE

02:27:08.352 --> 02:27:09.887
WILL. SEEK APPROVAL FOR

02:27:09.954 --> 02:27:11.589
PARTICIPATION IN THE FEDERAL

02:27:11.656 --> 02:27:12.523
STUDENT AID PROGRAMS WHICH ARE

02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:14.458
REALLY ALSO UNLOCK RESOURCES

02:27:14.525 --> 02:27:15.526
AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR

02:27:15.593 --> 02:27:17.628
STUDENTS WHO CAN USE THAT

02:27:17.695 --> 02:27:18.996
SUPPORT AND THAT RELIEF TO

02:27:19.063 --> 02:27:19.463
REALLY ENGAGE IN THIS

02:27:19.530 --> 02:27:21.632
OPPORTUNITY- SO I THINK THERE

02:27:21.699 --> 02:27:23.201
IS A LOT THAT WE HAVE DONE FOR

02:27:23.267 --> 02:27:24.468
THE STATE OF DEVELOPMENT THAT

02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:25.937
WERE IN AGAIN GOING BACK TO

02:27:26.003 --> 02:27:27.205
THAT SEVEN YEAR TIME WINDOW.

02:27:27.271 --> 02:27:28.406
BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING ME IF I'M

02:27:28.472 --> 02:27:29.507
SATISFIED TODAY WITH THE

02:27:29.574 --> 02:27:31.275
PROGRESS THAT WE MADE I'M THE

02:27:31.342 --> 02:27:32.810
KIND OF PERSON WHO GETS THE

02:27:32.877 --> 02:27:34.278
FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR SO I

02:27:34.345 --> 02:27:37.715
HATE THAT I ABSOLUTELY- SEE THE

02:27:37.782 --> 02:27:39.717
INTENSE VALUE OF SCALING THIS

02:27:39.784 --> 02:27:40.985
UP IN A HIGH QUALITY WAY AND TO

02:27:41.052 --> 02:27:42.186
DO IT RESPONSIBLY AS GOOD

02:27:42.253 --> 02:27:44.055
STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS AT

02:27:44.121 --> 02:27:45.856
THE SAME TIME I UNDERSTAND.

02:27:45.923 --> 02:27:48.125
THAT IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD

02:27:48.192 --> 02:27:50.428
HIGH QUALITY THINGS AND THE WAY

02:27:50.494 --> 02:27:52.163
THAT WE APPROACH THE WORK HAS A

02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:54.165
LASTING IMPACT ON THE

02:27:54.232 --> 02:27:56.000
EFFECTIVENESS AT SCALE AND SO

02:27:56.067 --> 02:27:57.468
WE DON'T I I'VE TAKEN ALL THE

02:27:57.535 --> 02:27:58.636
LESSONS THAT I'VE LEARNED FROM

02:27:58.703 --> 02:27:59.937
WEARING MY REGULATORY HAT THAT

02:28:00.004 --> 02:28:01.639
THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGE INDUSTRY

02:28:01.706 --> 02:28:03.374
AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT

02:28:03.441 --> 02:28:05.509
WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING HERE.

02:28:05.576 --> 02:28:06.911
IS AGAIN IN THE BILL REFINING

02:28:06.978 --> 02:28:08.879
AND FOCUSING ON WHAT WORKS FOR

02:28:08.946 --> 02:28:09.780
THE COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO

02:28:09.847 --> 02:28:11.415
SERVE WHAT FLEXIBILITY AS WE

02:28:11.482 --> 02:28:13.251
NEED FOR SERVICES WE DO WE DO

02:28:13.317 --> 02:28:14.952
THAT AT A MUCH FASTER CLIP THAN

02:28:15.019 --> 02:28:17.088
CONVENTIONAL EDUCATION DOES AND

02:28:17.154 --> 02:28:18.689
THAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

02:28:18.756 --> 02:28:20.124
BECAUSE THE MORE WE LEARN THE

02:28:20.191 --> 02:28:20.992
MORE WE SHARE OUT WITH OUR

02:28:21.058 --> 02:28:22.593
SISTER INSTITUTIONS THE MORE WE

02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:24.161
COLLABORATE THE MORE WE ARRIVE

02:28:24.228 --> 02:28:25.496
AT THE SHARED SOLUTIONS AND THE

02:28:25.563 --> 02:28:30.868
IMPACT. OF WHAT WE HAVE IT'S

02:28:30.935 --> 02:28:32.136
NOT JUST ABOUT THE ALWAYS IN

02:29:17.548 --> 02:29:18.916
QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS

02:29:18.983 --> 02:29:21.352
REMINDS ME THAT THIS IS EXACTLY

02:29:21.419 --> 02:29:23.521
WHY OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE

02:29:23.587 --> 02:29:24.088
NOT GETTING THE FUNDING THEY

02:29:24.155 --> 02:29:26.724
DESERVE. THEY ARE RESPECTED AND

02:29:26.791 --> 02:29:27.491
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT

02:29:27.558 --> 02:29:29.193
RECOGNIZED FOR THE GREAT WORK

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:30.728
THEY'RE DOING OUR COMMUNITY.

02:29:30.795 --> 02:29:32.897
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE IN

02:29:32.963 --> 02:29:35.766
OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK IN THE

02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:38.569
ANSWERS- OF WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:29:38.636 --> 02:29:40.237
IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS

02:29:40.304 --> 02:29:41.872
WHAT MAKES YOU SO UNIQUE.

02:29:41.939 --> 02:29:44.208
EVERYTHING THAT I HEARD. WAS

02:29:44.275 --> 02:29:46.177
SOMETHING THAT IS OFFERED IN

02:29:46.243 --> 02:29:46.644
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:29:46.711 --> 02:29:48.913
EVERYTHING. THERE IS NOTHING

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:51.048
THAT I HAVE HEARD SO FAR THAT

02:29:51.115 --> 02:29:54.485
MAKES CAL BRIGHT UNIQUE. WHAT

02:29:54.552 --> 02:29:56.253
WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES THIS

02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:57.621
IS WHAT THE WHOLE ARGUMENT IS

02:29:57.688 --> 02:29:59.957
ABOUT EVERY BUDGET HEARING AND

02:30:00.024 --> 02:30:01.792
GET WITH OUR LIMITED RESOURCES

02:30:01.859 --> 02:30:04.095
WE'RE TAKING THAT MONEY THAT

02:30:04.161 --> 02:30:05.229
COULD BE ADDED ON TO OUR

02:30:05.296 --> 02:30:06.864
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THAT ARE

02:30:06.931 --> 02:30:09.200
ALREADY PROVIDING ALL THESE

02:30:09.266 --> 02:30:10.835
CLASSES ONLINE. THE WORK THAT

02:30:10.901 --> 02:30:14.372
IS BEING DONE IS DUPLICATIVE.

02:30:14.438 --> 02:30:17.708
THE MORE WE GIVE TO. CALIBRATE

02:30:17.775 --> 02:30:19.443

BRIGHT IS TAKING MONEY AWAY

02:31:15.266 --> 02:31:16.267
THAT COULD GO TO OUR COMMUNITY

THEIR JOB MARKETS THE BIRCH

02:32:00.945 --> 02:32:03.848
GOING FORWARD. WE PLAN ON AT

THAT THE LAUNCH OF NEW PROGRAMS

ALSO WILL THINK ABOUT THIS FROM

02:32:08.018 --> 02:32:09.220
THE PERSPECTIVE OF. WHAT

STUDENTS ARE NAVIGATING THEIR

02:32:10.621 --> 02:32:12.389

CHOICES THAT WE ALSO MADE FOR

02:32:13.657 --> 02:32:16.327
NEW PROGRAMS. THAT REFLECT THE

02:32:16.393 --> 02:32:17.561
THAT THE CHORE ECONOMICALLY

02:32:17.628 --> 02:32:18.996

FAMILY RETAIL WORK AND

02:32:20.564 --> 02:32:21.899
HOSPITALITY OTHER AREAS OF

02:32:21.966 --> 02:32:23.501
CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THINKING

02:32:23.567 --> 02:32:25.336
ABOUT HOW THE SKILLS THAT THEY

02:32:25.402 --> 02:32:27.872
HAVE CAN TRANSLATE INTO- THAT

02:32:27.938 --> 02:32:31.141
THE- THAT THE TECHNOLOGY FIELD

02:32:31.208 --> 02:32:33.310
AND SPACE. AT TO PROVIDE THEM

02:32:33.377 --> 02:32:33.911
TO INTO THE PLACES WHERE

02:32:33.978 --> 02:32:35.079
THERE'S EVEN MORE JOB

02:32:35.145 --> 02:32:36.814
OPPORTUNITIES. AND IS THERE A

02:32:36.881 --> 02:32:41.318
PLAN TO REGULARLY. COLLECT DATA

02:32:41.385 --> 02:32:42.987
AND REPORT ON THIS. YES SO- WE

02:32:43.053 --> 02:32:44.221
ARE AB GOING TO BE COLLECTING

02:32:44.288 --> 02:32:46.156
DATA ON JOB PLACEMENT AND WAGE

02:32:46.223 --> 02:32:47.691
GAINS AND WHAT WE'RE ALSO

02:32:47.758 --> 02:32:49.927
RECOGNIZING AS WE HEAR MORE AND

02:32:49.994 --> 02:32:50.728
STUDY MORE ABOUT WHAT'S

02:32:50.794 --> 02:32:51.896
HAPPENING IN THE EMPLOYMENT

02:32:51.962 --> 02:32:53.230
MARKET TO THIS POPULATION IN.

02:32:53.297 --> 02:32:55.299
THESE COMMUNITIES OF WORKERS IS

02:32:55.366 --> 02:32:57.301
THAT WE NEED BETTER DATA

02:32:57.368 --> 02:32:57.801
COLLECTION AND MORE DATA

02:32:57.868 --> 02:32:59.703
COLLECTION AROUND THE DIFFERENT

02:32:59.770 --> 02:33:00.571
EXPERIENCES THEY HAVE IN THE

02:33:00.638 --> 02:33:02.172
LABOR MARKET SO WHAT I MEAN BY

02:33:02.239 --> 02:33:03.841
THAT IS. THAT WHEN WE'RE

02:33:03.908 --> 02:33:05.175
LOOKING AT HEALTHCARE WE ARE

02:33:05.242 --> 02:33:07.344
ALSO THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS

02:33:07.411 --> 02:33:10.047
REQUIRED FOR INDIVIDUALS TO

02:33:10.114 --> 02:33:12.049
KEEP THE JOB THAT THEY HAVE BUT

02:33:12.116 --> 02:33:13.717
TO HAVE THE NECESSARY SKILLS.

02:33:13.784 --> 02:33:15.019
THAT'S BASED ON THE WAY THAT

02:33:15.085 --> 02:33:15.686
HEALTH CARE DELIVERY ISN'T

02:33:15.753 --> 02:33:17.521
CHANGING OUR CONVERSATIONS

02:33:17.588 --> 02:33:18.956
ACTUALLY WITH AND SEE IF YOU

THE NEEDS OF THEIR WORKFORCE

02:33:25.896 --> 02:33:28.032
AND THEIR FRONT LINE WORKERS

02:33:28.098 --> 02:33:30.534
AND WE IT ALSO SOMETIMES. AS I

02:33:30.601 --> 02:33:31.435
MENTIONED IN THIS CASE OF THE

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:33.137
NEW PROGRAMS THAT WERE

02:33:33.203 --> 02:33:34.438
LAUNCHING MOVING PEOPLE FROM AN

02:33:34.505 --> 02:33:36.106
INDUSTRY THAT IS AN ANTICLINE

02:33:36.173 --> 02:33:38.075
INDUSTRY INTO AN INDUSTRY OUT

02:33:38.142 --> 02:33:40.277
OF. OUR GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY

02:33:40.344 --> 02:33:41.879
AND CAREER EXPANSION FOR THEM

02:33:41.946 --> 02:33:42.947
SOMETIMES IT IS GOING FROM AN

02:33:43.013 --> 02:33:45.015
HOURLY JOB TO A BENEFITTED JOB.

02:33:45.082 --> 02:33:46.684
THOSE ARE THE GUYS THAT I CUT

02:33:46.750 --> 02:33:47.952
OUTCOMES NEED TO BE TRACKING

02:33:48.018 --> 02:33:49.720
CODE GOING FORWARD AND WE HAVE

02:33:49.787 --> 02:33:51.455
EVERY INTENTION OF. DOING SO-

02:33:51.522 --> 02:33:53.891
IN THE FUTURE. I'M ONE

02:33:53.958 --> 02:33:55.626
PLACEMENT IS VERY CONCERNING

02:33:55.693 --> 02:33:58.295
WITH THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM-

02:33:58.362 --> 02:34:01.865
AND- IT RAISES FRANKLY RED

02:34:01.932 --> 02:34:05.135
FLAGS FOR ME- ARE. N. THE

02:34:05.202 --> 02:34:10.941
QUESTION. IS ARE THE PROGRAMS.

02:34:11.008 --> 02:34:12.476
ARE THE R. D. THE PROGRAM THAT

02:34:12.543 --> 02:34:14.478

02:34:14.545 --> 02:34:15.546
WHAT WE NEED. I'M YOU'RE A IT

02:34:15.613 --> 02:34:18.282
YOU BE TO THREE NEW PATH. BUT

02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:19.717
FOR. SO HOW'S IS THAT STILL ON

02:34:19.783 --> 02:34:21.819
TRACK WHAT ARE THEY AND HOW DO

02:34:21.885 --> 02:34:23.988
WE KNOW THAT. THEY'RE GONNA

02:34:24.054 --> 02:34:26.423
PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT OUTCOMES

02:34:26.490 --> 02:34:27.024
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SEEING THOSE

02:34:27.091 --> 02:34:30.294
OUTCOMES NOW. YES I CAN TELL

02:34:30.361 --> 02:34:31.729
YOU I'M NOT SATISFIED OBVIOUSLY

02:34:31.795 --> 02:34:34.398
WITH- WITH THE NUMBERS SIGNED

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:35.599
AT. STUDENT LABOR MARKET

02:34:35.666 --> 02:34:37.635
OUTCOMES I AM ALSO VERY

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:39.103
EMPATHETIC TO THE REALITIES

02:34:39.169 --> 02:34:40.704
THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE FACING RAP

02:34:40.771 --> 02:34:41.572
OF THE REALITIES OF WHAT'S

02:34:41.639 --> 02:34:43.340
HAPPENING IN THE HIRING MARKET

02:34:43.407 --> 02:34:45.776
AND SO- WHEN IT REQUIRES FOLKS

02:34:45.843 --> 02:34:47.678
TO. TAKE TIME TO PROGRESS WEEK

02:34:47.745 --> 02:34:48.846
WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT WHEN IT

02:34:48.912 --> 02:34:50.514
WHEN THAT JOB SEARCH EFFORT

02:34:50.581 --> 02:34:51.749
IT'S HARDER BECAUSE THE LABOR

02:34:51.815 --> 02:34:53.217
MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE MADE IT

02:34:53.283 --> 02:34:54.718
SO. THAT WE ARE ALSO THERE FOR

02:34:54.785 --> 02:34:56.353
THEM GOING FORWARD WE ARE ON

02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:58.255
TRACK TO MEET OUR STATUTORY.

02:34:58.322 --> 02:35:00.157
COMMITMENT TO THREE NEW PROGRAM

02:35:00.224 --> 02:35:01.659
PATHWAYS THE FIRST AS I

02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:02.993
MENTIONED THAT WAS APPROVED BY

02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:04.595
OUR BOARD WITH THIS TRADITION

02:35:04.662 --> 02:35:06.196
TO TECHNOLOGY PATHWAY. THAT'S A

02:35:06.263 --> 02:35:07.164
PATHWAY THAT LEADS TO AN

02:35:07.231 --> 02:35:08.098
INDUSTRY RECOGNIZED

02:35:08.165 --> 02:35:09.700
CERTIFICATION IN WHAT'S CALLED

02:35:09.767 --> 02:35:11.769
CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGEMENT

02:35:11.835 --> 02:35:12.903
SO IT'S THE ACTUAL SET OF

02:35:12.970 --> 02:35:13.937
TECHNOLOGIES THAT IS

02:35:14.004 --> 02:35:15.839
FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMING. THE

02:35:15.906 --> 02:35:19.109
WAY THAT INDIVIDUALS- THE END

02:35:19.176 --> 02:35:20.511
BUSINESSES MAINTAIN CUSTOMER

02:35:20.577 --> 02:35:23.180
RELATIONS AS WELL AS- WELL AS

02:35:23.247 --> 02:35:25.582
ENGAGE IN SALES AND SO- OUR

02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:27.317
PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO MEET.

02:35:27.384 --> 02:35:28.585
AT THE GROWING CHANGING

02:35:28.652 --> 02:35:29.787
BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT

02:35:29.853 --> 02:35:32.022
EMPLOYERS ARE- THAT BUSINESS

02:35:32.089 --> 02:35:32.956
SERVICES FOR MAKING THAT ARE

02:35:33.023 --> 02:35:34.024
CHANGING SOME OF THEIR SKILLS

02:35:34.091 --> 02:35:37.094
NEEDS- SO FOCUSING ON THOSE AND

02:35:37.161 --> 02:35:38.128

THOSE. ROLES ARE A KEY PART OF

02:35:42.433 --> 02:35:44.668
THAT WE ARE ALSO AS I MENTIONED

02:35:44.735 --> 02:35:47.071

ARE FACING. IN THE IN THE IN

02:36:01.518 --> 02:36:02.486
THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING IN

02:36:02.553 --> 02:36:03.987
HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND THAT

02:36:04.054 --> 02:36:05.689
HAS BEEN VERY MUCH ABOUT.

02:36:05.756 --> 02:36:06.957
LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING FROM

02:36:07.024 --> 02:36:09.293

ALIGNED TO THAT AND THEY'LL BE

02:36:19.803 --> 02:36:27.077

SOME TECHNICAL SKILLS TO

RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT AND- IN

02:42:47.624 --> 02:42:54.397
IN THE COURSE OF. OF WORK BEING

ENROLL. BUT I THINK THE PRETTY

02:43:01.771 --> 02:43:03.640
GOOD SENSE OF THE FOR HUNDRED-

02:43:03.707 --> 02:43:05.075

THEIR THERE ACTIVE- AND IT'S A

02:43:13.283 --> 02:43:14.985
MESS I THINK. WHAT'S IMPORTANT

02:43:15.051 --> 02:43:16.286
FOR ABOUT THESE PRO. IS THAT

02:43:16.353 --> 02:43:18.522

STUDENTS ACTION. NO DON'T BE ON

02:43:20.290 --> 02:43:22.325
A TWO BASIS YEAH SET THE GOALS

02:43:22.392 --> 02:43:24.060
THAT THEY HAVE AND THAT

02:43:24.127 --> 02:43:25.562
FLEXIBILITY IS IMPORTANT FOR

02:43:25.629 --> 02:43:26.930
THIS POPULATION HAS BEEN TALKED

02:43:26.997 --> 02:43:29.399
ABOUT BEFORE. LARGELY BECAUSE

02:43:29.466 --> 02:43:30.600
THIS IS THE TIME IN WHICH THEY

02:43:30.667 --> 02:43:32.736
NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY OFTEN

02:43:32.802 --> 02:43:34.104
THOSE FLEXIBILITIES TAKE THE

02:43:34.171 --> 02:43:35.972
FORM OF. NOT NEEDING TO STEP

02:43:36.039 --> 02:43:37.941
AWAY FOR A COUPLE WEEKS BECAUSE

02:43:38.008 --> 02:43:39.709
THERE IS A FAMILY MEMBER TOLD

02:43:39.776 --> 02:43:41.278
HER THAT HER FAMILY THAT SIX.

02:43:41.344 --> 02:43:42.045
WHEN THEY HAVE CHILDCARE

02:43:42.112 --> 02:43:43.113
RESPONSIBILITIES FURTHER

02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:45.048
DOUBLING UP AS A TEACHER AT

02:43:45.115 --> 02:43:47.584
HOME- IF WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF

02:43:47.651 --> 02:43:48.985
THE STORIES MEET AND SURVEYS

02:43:49.052 --> 02:43:51.555
OUR STUDENTS. AND ADD DURING

02:43:51.621 --> 02:43:53.223
THE PANDEMIC TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:43:53.290 --> 02:43:54.424
THE MAJORITY OF THEM WERE

02:43:54.491 --> 02:43:56.359
AFFECTED BY THAT THE PANDEMIC

02:43:56.426 --> 02:43:57.827
AND REALLY ADVERSE WAYS IN WAYS

02:43:57.894 --> 02:44:00.197
THAT- INCLUDED THINGS LIKE THEY

02:44:00.263 --> 02:44:02.332
HAD. EXPERIENCED JOB LOSS OR

02:44:02.399 --> 02:44:04.901
FOR LOW OR FAT LOSS OF INCOME

02:44:04.968 --> 02:44:06.937
IN HOURS A COMBINATION OF

02:44:07.003 --> 02:44:07.604
THINGS THAT HAS MADE IT

02:44:07.671 --> 02:44:09.239
SOMETIMES DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

02:44:09.306 --> 02:44:11.074
HAVE EDUCATION BE TOP OF MIND.

02:44:11.141 --> 02:44:12.742
SO WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON WITH

02:44:12.809 --> 02:44:14.244
THAT FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS IS.

02:44:14.311 --> 02:44:15.745
CONTINUALLY TRYING TO SANCTION

02:44:15.812 --> 02:44:17.347
THEM CROWDING THEM ALONG ME

02:44:17.414 --> 02:44:19.382
COURAGE AND THEN I HAVE IT A

02:44:19.449 --> 02:44:21.751
TREMENDOUS. FIVE INSTRUCTIONAL

02:44:21.818 --> 02:44:23.220
FACULTY BUT ALSO THREE FULL

02:44:23.286 --> 02:44:24.421
TIME FACULTY IN THE COUNSELING

02:44:24.487 --> 02:44:26.990
SPACE THAT REALLY DON'T WORK IN

02:44:27.057 --> 02:44:27.924
A SILENT WAY IS WE TYPICALLY

02:44:27.991 --> 02:44:30.160
SEE COLORS WORK TOGETHER. AND

02:44:30.227 --> 02:44:31.528
AS IN TEAMS AROUND THESE

02:44:31.595 --> 02:44:32.896
LEARNERS AND THAT'S THAT YOU

02:44:32.963 --> 02:44:34.231
KNOW THAT'S AN INNOVATION IN

02:44:34.297 --> 02:44:36.333
THE MODEL THAT- THAT WOULD BE

02:44:36.399 --> 02:44:38.969
IMPLEMENTED IN THE FALL. AND

02:44:39.035 --> 02:44:41.338
THEN AS AT A TIME WHEN THE REST

02:44:41.404 --> 02:44:43.240
OF THE SYSTEM TO COMMUNICATE

02:44:43.306 --> 02:44:43.807
SYSTEM THEIR ROMAN IS GOING

02:44:43.873 --> 02:44:45.809
DOWN. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN ON

FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND.

02:44:54.618 --> 02:44:55.218
ABSOLUTELY I THINK WHAT IS

02:44:55.285 --> 02:44:56.620
IMPORTANT IT UNDER IS THAT THE

02:44:56.686 --> 02:45:01.258
ARE NEW. OF AND I AM. AND BUT-

02:45:01.324 --> 02:45:02.926

OF HEARING SAY IT- YEAH I

02:45:06.129 --> 02:45:07.330
EXPERIENCED TERRORISTS AND THEN

02:45:07.397 --> 02:45:09.232
OUR- WHAT HAPPENED ON THE- FOR.

ACTUALLY- IN. THAT PROCESS ON

02:46:16.499 --> 02:46:17.901
THE PART OF FOR PROFIT COLLEGES

02:46:17.967 --> 02:46:19.369
AS COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT'S

02:46:19.436 --> 02:46:21.171
NOT WHAT WE DO BUT THERE ARE

02:46:21.237 --> 02:46:22.739
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO SO ONE OF

02:46:22.806 --> 02:46:23.940
THE THINGS THAT WE IDENTIFIED

CROSSES INSTITUTIONS IT'S

02:46:26.576 --> 02:46:27.977
IMPORTANT TO COUNTER ACT

02:46:28.044 --> 02:46:29.879
AGAINST THE FOR PROFIT SAYS-

02:46:29.946 --> 02:46:31.181
RECOGNIZING THAT WE WERE

IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS IT

02:46:36.186 --> 02:46:36.753
WITH FALLING OUT OF THE SYSTEM

02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:37.887
WHY DO YOU THINK THE

02:46:37.954 --> 02:46:39.122

THERE. THAT NOT JUST BENEFIT

02:46:48.465 --> 02:46:50.033
ENROLLEES AT CALIBRATE STUDENTS

COMING FROM THE SEPARATE

02:46:50.934 --> 02:46:52.602
POPULATIONS BUT THIS IS GOING

02:46:52.669 --> 02:46:54.237
TO BE A PAIN POINT THAT OTHER
