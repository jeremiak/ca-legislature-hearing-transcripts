THAT WE WORK HARD BUT OUR STAFF

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:07.968
WORKS MUCH HARDER.

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:09.837
AND IT'S BEEN A HERCULEAN EFFORT

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:11.839
TO GET THIS BUDGET A TO THE

01:35:11.906 --> 01:35:13.007
STATE IT'S IN TODAY.

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:14.008
I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:15.409
THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT THIS

01:35:15.476 --> 01:35:16.677
BUDGET.

01:35:16.744 --> 01:35:17.778
WE'RE MAKING VERY MEANINGFUL

01:35:17.845 --> 01:35:19.280
CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STATE

01:35:19.346 --> 01:35:20.948
RESERVES IN FACT WILL FINISH THE

01:35:21.015 --> 01:35:22.883
YEAR WITH ALMOST TWENTY BILLION

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:24.018
DOLLARS OF RESERVES WHICH IS THE

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:25.519
LARGEST RESERVE IN CALIFORNIA

01:35:25.586 --> 01:35:26.854
STATE HISTORY.

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:28.456
BUT TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE

01:35:28.522 --> 01:35:29.256
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST

01:35:29.323 --> 01:35:30.991
ESTIMATES THAT EVEN A MODERATE

01:35:31.058 --> 01:35:32.893
RECESSION WILL HAVE A SEVENTY

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.528
BILLION DOLLAR IMPACT ON STATE

01:35:34.595 --> 01:35:35.930
REVENUE AND THAT THE TOTAL

01:35:35.996 --> 01:35:37.631
IMPACT ON STATE BUDGETS OVER A

01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:39.233
MULTI YEAR CYCLE WILL BE ON THE

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.401
ORDER OF FORTY BILLION DOLLARS

01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:41.502
SO.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:43.204
IF OUR GOAL IS A STATE.

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:44.972
IS TO HAVE A RESERVE POLICY THAT

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:46.674
SUFFICIENT TO HAVE THE STATE BE

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:47.908
ABLE TO WEATHER A RECESSION

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:50.277
WITHOUT EITHER RAISING TAXES OR

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:51.212
CUTTING SERVICES OF THE TIME

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:52.346
WHEN IT'S LEAST CAN AFFORD TO DO

01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:52.980
THAT.

01:35:53.047 --> 01:35:54.348
THEN WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY THERE

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:56.550
SO THIS RESERVE POLICY IS A GOOD

01:35:56.617 --> 01:35:58.219
START WE'RE GONNA NEED TO STAY

01:35:58.285 --> 01:36:00.754
THE COURSE AND TO MAKE SURE WE

01:36:00.821 --> 01:36:01.355
GET THEIR OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:01.622
OF YEARS.

01:36:01.689 --> 01:36:03.591
HOWEVER I REALLY DISAGREE WITH

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:04.692
THE WAY THAT WE'RE INVESTING

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:06.627
THAT THE REST OF OUR BUDGET

01:36:06.694 --> 01:36:08.629
SURPLUS WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

01:36:08.696 --> 01:36:10.764
WITH THE SURPLUS TO SHORE UP OUR

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:11.966
STATE SERVICES AND TO MAKE SURE

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:12.867
THAT WERE FOR FILLING THE

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:13.968
PROMISES THAT WE MADE TO

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:14.802
CALIFORNIA.

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:16.604
IN THE BASIC SERVICES THE STATE

01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:18.072
PROVIDES AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:20.374
ELECTED INSTEAD TO EXPAND OUR

01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:21.375
PROGRAMS IN TO CREATE NEW

01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:22.376
PROGRAMS AND I'LL GIVE YOU A

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:23.711
COUPLE OF EXAMPLE.

01:36:23.777 --> 01:36:25.379
STARTING WITH MEDI CAL.

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:26.747
THIS BUDGET PROPOSES A

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.382
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:30.384
ENROLLMENT FOR MEDI CAL AND THIS

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:31.585
IS AN ERA WHEN MEDI CAL IS

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:32.820
ALREADY FAILING TO PROVIDE THE

01:36:32.887 --> 01:36:34.922
SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED

01:36:34.989 --> 01:36:35.689
IT MOST IN CALIFORNIA.

01:36:35.756 --> 01:36:37.958
EVERY DAY OF MY DISTRICT OFFICES

01:36:38.025 --> 01:36:40.294
GETS CALLS FROM MY CONSTITUENTS

01:36:40.361 --> 01:36:42.062
WHO ARE UNABLE TO SEE A DOCTOR

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:43.898
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE TECHNICALLY

01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:45.399
COVERED BY MEDICARE BECAUSE FOR

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:46.700
SO FEW DOCTORS IN MY DISTRICT.

01:36:46.767 --> 01:36:47.768
ARE ABLE TO TAKE THE LOW

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:49.136
REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT MEDI

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:50.271
CAL PROVIDES.

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:53.073
WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIX

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:53.707
THAT WITH THIS BUDGET AND WE'RE

01:36:53.774 --> 01:36:54.275
NOT DOING IT.

01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:56.076
I'D ALSO LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE

01:36:56.143 --> 01:36:57.178
BIT ABOUT K. TWELVE EDUCATION.

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:58.913
THIS BUDGET PROVIDES A MODEST

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:01.115
INCREASE IN PER STUDENT SPENDING

BY MODEST I MEAN ABOUT IN LINE

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:04.718
WITH INFLATION WILL BRING US UP

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:06.453
TO JUST OVER TWELVE THOUSAND

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:06.921
DOLLARS.

01:37:06.987 --> 01:37:08.622
PER STUDENT BUT TO PUT THAT IN

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:09.857
PERSPECTIVE.

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:10.658
ADJUSTED FOR THE COST OF LIVING

01:37:10.724 --> 01:37:12.426

OUT OF THE FIFTY STATES SO GIVEN

01:37:15.996 --> 01:37:18.132
THAT STATISTIC IT'S NO SURPRISE

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:20.167
THAT OUR TEACHER TO STUDENT

01:37:20.234 --> 01:37:21.902

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:23.437
ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:25.206
THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THAT

01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:27.174
PROBLEM WITH HIS BUDGET AND

WITH MISGUIDED PRIORITIES.

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:21.548
WE'RE NOT PUTTING CALIFORNIA'S

01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:23.684
FIRST.

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:24.284
WE'RE NOT PUTTING OUR VETERANS

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:25.586
FIRST.

01:40:25.652 --> 01:40:26.587
WE'RE NOT PUTTING OUR PEOPLE

01:40:26.653 --> 01:40:29.089
WITH DISABILITIES FIRST.

01:40:29.156 --> 01:40:30.624
WE'RE NOT PUTTING CALIFORNIA

01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:32.960

01:40:33.026 --> 01:40:35.129
INSTEAD THE BIGGEST INCREASE TO

01:40:35.195 --> 01:40:36.163
THIS BUDGET.

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:37.331
IS FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EVEN

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:42.836
AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS AND

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:44.972
WE LOOK AT THESE PRIORITIES.

01:40:45.038 --> 01:40:46.573
IT'S ALL MESSED UP.

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:47.708
THE IN HOUSE OF MY COLLEAGUE

01:40:47.775 --> 01:40:49.543
FROM BIG BEAR SAID.

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:51.445
THIS IS GOT TO BE THE PORTEOUS

01:40:51.512 --> 01:40:53.881
BUDGET WE'VE EVER SEEN.

01:40:53.947 --> 01:40:54.715
I I THINK.

01:40:54.782 --> 01:40:56.917
THAT NOT EVEN PORKY PIG COULD DO

01:40:56.984 --> 01:41:01.155
A BETTER JOB AT THE PARK IN THIS.

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:04.324
BUT WE GET WE CONTINUE.

01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:05.959
AND WE'RE WE'RE GONNA SAY ALL

01:41:06.026 --> 01:41:07.594
THESE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THESE

01:41:07.661 --> 01:41:09.630
SMALL MARGINAL INCREASES THAT

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:10.831
WE'VE DONE THAT HAVE BEEN A LONG

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:12.666
INFLATION RATES.

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:14.468
BUT WE'RE NOT DOING NEARLY

01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:16.403
ENOUGH.

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:17.604
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HELPING THE

01:41:17.671 --> 01:41:19.039
DISABLED COMMUNITY BUT WE'RE

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:20.941
JUST BARELY GIVEN A LITTLE BIT.

01:41:21.008 --> 01:41:22.709
I HOPE WE CAN FIX THAT WITH SOME

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:23.110
TRAILER BILL'S.

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:25.012
GOING FORWARD.

01:41:25.078 --> 01:41:26.079
BEFORE WE CLOSE OUT THE SESSION

01:41:26.146 --> 01:41:27.614
THIS YEAR.

01:41:27.681 --> 01:41:29.049
I I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WE

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:31.952
COULD BE DOING FOR OUR VETERANS.

01:41:32.019 --> 01:41:33.420
IN THE BIGGEST THING WHEN WE

01:41:33.487 --> 01:41:35.823

01:41:35.889 --> 01:41:38.959
FOR ALL IS THE ACCESS PORTION.

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:41.328

PROVIDERS THAT'S THE DOCTORS.

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.036
THAT OUR FAMILIES ARE HAVING TO

01:41:49.102 --> 01:41:51.438
WAIT TO GO SEE.

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:53.407
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING AS I'VE SAID

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:55.676
BEFORE AS WE ARE INFLATING THE

01:41:55.742 --> 01:41:57.811
NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

01:41:57.878 --> 01:41:58.378
THAT ARE GOING TO BE ON THE

01:41:58.445 --> 01:42:00.447
SYSTEM.

01:42:00.514 --> 01:42:02.783
BUT WE ARE NOT INCREASING.

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:04.585
THE CAPACITY LEVEL WE'RE NOT

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:05.752

01:42:05.819 --> 01:42:08.989
MORE DOCTORS IN THEIR WE'RE NOT

01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:12.926
IN TO HELP GET MORE PROVIDERS TO

01:42:12.993 --> 01:42:15.395
BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS INFLUX.

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:16.830

01:42:22.569 --> 01:42:24.872

SEE THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES TO

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.731
PRIORITIZE MENTAL HEALTH

01:52:18.798 --> 01:52:20.600

THE NEW BUDGET INCLUDES A

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:23.436
HUNDRED MILLION TO INCREASE THE

PROFESSIONALS.

01:52:26.139 --> 01:52:28.041
BUT WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO ENSURE

01:52:28.108 --> 01:52:29.642
THAT EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IS

01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:31.911

STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION.

01:52:33.646 --> 01:52:36.483
LIKE FUNDING MEDICATION ASSISTED

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:40.620
THAT WE'VE BEEN.

01:52:40.687 --> 01:52:43.089
TRYING TO FIGHT FOR FOR YEARS

01:52:43.156 --> 01:52:45.024
AND IT'S STILL NOT ADDRESS.

01:52:45.091 --> 01:52:46.626
WHAT ABOUT -- DEVELOPMENTAL

01:52:46.693 --> 01:52:48.161
DISABILITIES COMMUNITY.

01:52:48.228 --> 01:52:50.630
WE CAN DO MORE.

01:52:50.697 --> 01:52:52.799
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

01:52:52.866 --> 01:52:54.701
COIN NOT ALL CAREERS REQUIRE A

01:52:54.767 --> 01:52:56.002
BACHELOR'S DEGREE.

01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:57.504
IN FACT MANY CAREERS IN THE

01:52:57.570 --> 01:52:59.272
TRADES PROVIDE MIDDLE CLASS

01:52:59.339 --> 01:53:01.541
SALARIES THE CAN'T BE AUTOMATED

01:53:01.608 --> 01:53:03.009
LIKE OTHER JOBS.

01:53:03.076 --> 01:53:04.811
AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE A BUDGET

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:06.212
THAT INVESTS IN CAREER TAX

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:08.248
EDUCATION.

01:53:08.314 --> 01:53:09.649
AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:53:09.716 --> 01:53:09.949
[inaudible]

01:53:10.016 --> 01:53:11.684
HOWEVER.

01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:15.188
THE DMV GETS A BLANK CHECK. TWO

01:53:15.255 --> 01:53:15.755

01:53:24.097 --> 01:53:25.798
ONE ALLOWING FOR MORE IF

01:53:25.865 --> 01:53:27.901
REQUIRED BASICALLY A BLANK CHECK.

01:53:27.967 --> 01:53:31.070
FAR TOO GENEROUS FOR DEPARTMENT

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:32.672
RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMS.

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:34.174
BUT ON A GOOD NOTE.

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.441
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

01:53:35.508 --> 01:53:38.645
FOR CAL FIRE. FOR MORE YEAR

01:53:38.711 --> 01:53:40.680
ROUND ENGINES HEAVY EQUIPMENT

01:53:40.747 --> 01:53:43.449
STAFFING AND SEE ONE THIRTY AIR

01:53:43.516 --> 01:53:45.451
TANKERS BUT THIS BUDGET DOES

01:53:45.518 --> 01:53:47.520
NOTHING TO HELP LOCAL AGENCIES

01:53:47.587 --> 01:53:49.489
REDUCE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES

01:53:49.556 --> 01:53:50.990
CAUSED BY VEHICLES.

01:53:51.057 --> 01:53:53.593
IN SAN DIEGO NEARLY 25% OF

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:54.961
WILDFIRES WAS STARTED BY

01:53:55.028 --> 01:53:56.095
VEHICLES.

01:53:56.162 --> 01:54:00.934
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND 201725%.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.470
WE CAN PREVENT UP TO ONE QUARTER

01:54:04.537 --> 01:54:06.806
OF WILDFIRES STATEWIDE.

01:54:06.873 --> 01:54:08.575
BUT THIS ITEM WAS IGNORED IN THE

01:54:08.641 --> 01:54:11.611
BUDGET DESPITE SUPPORT FROM FIRE

01:54:11.678 --> 01:54:13.379

AS WAS STATED A HUGE A HUGE

01:54:19.953 --> 01:54:22.622
PRIORITY -- THE NEEDS TO BE

01:54:22.689 --> 01:54:23.723
ADDRESSED AND HAS BEEN AN ISSUE

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:25.592
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IS

01:54:25.658 --> 01:54:27.961
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. ONE BIG

01:54:28.027 --> 01:54:29.229
STEP WOULD BE INCREASING

01:54:29.295 --> 01:54:30.630
REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR

01:54:30.697 --> 01:54:32.031
PHYSICIANS AND PROVIDERS A

01:54:32.098 --> 01:54:33.032
MINUTE KILL.

01:54:33.099 --> 01:54:35.768
MEDI CAL AN EFFORT TO INCREASE

01:54:35.835 --> 01:54:37.770
THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS.

01:54:37.837 --> 01:54:39.706
IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

01:54:39.772 --> 01:54:41.708
YET THIS BUDGET OPENS UP MEDI

01:54:41.774 --> 01:54:43.810
CAL TO MORE ENROLLEES WITHOUT

01:54:43.876 --> 01:54:46.546
ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF AXIS.

01:54:46.613 --> 01:54:48.281
SO IN ADDITION TO MY COLLEAGUE

LIKE THIS BUDGET?

01:55:25.618 --> 01:55:27.587
IS A UNICORN IN A SENSE IT'S

01:55:27.654 --> 01:55:29.989
NEVER BEFORE BEEN SEEN CERTAINLY

01:55:30.056 --> 01:55:31.157
NOT BY LEGISLATORS IN THIS

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:33.960
GENERATION ONE THAT COMES WITH

ON SO MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

01:55:39.065 --> 01:55:41.668
THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING TO LIFT

01:55:41.734 --> 01:55:43.903
UP SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. TO

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:46.139
LIFT OUR SCHOOLS OUT OF OUT OF

01:55:46.205 --> 01:55:48.274
IT THE LOWS OF FUNDING. TO PAY

01:55:48.341 --> 01:55:51.744
DOWN BILLIONS IN PENSION DAT.

01:55:51.811 --> 01:55:54.047
AND INTO STOCK AWAY OVER

01:55:54.113 --> 01:55:56.015
NINETEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN A

01:55:56.082 --> 01:55:57.917
RAINY DAY FUND THAT WAS SET UP

01:55:57.984 --> 01:56:02.689
BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY

01:56:02.755 --> 01:56:03.222
FOURTEEN I WITH THE VOTERS

01:56:03.289 --> 01:56:03.923
APPROVAL.

01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.590
BUT WE KNOW THAT UNICORNS DON'T

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:05.992
EXIST.

01:56:06.059 --> 01:56:07.427
AND BUT JUST LIKE THIS ARE MORE

01:56:07.493 --> 01:56:09.662
OF A MIRAGE AND THAT IS WHY THE

01:56:09.729 --> 01:56:11.464
RAINY DAY FUND AND THOSE ONE

01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:14.634
TIME PAYMENTS ARE SO IMPORTANT

01:56:14.701 --> 01:56:15.802
TO MAKE OUR FUTURE YEARS.

01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:17.303
A WHOLE LOT EASIER.

01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:18.304
AND I THINK IT SHOWS THE

01:56:18.371 --> 01:56:20.106
DISCIPLINE.

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:22.342
OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT SINCE WE

01:56:22.408 --> 01:56:23.543
WERE ELECTED WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:26.713
PAY DOWN THAT WALL OF DAT.

01:56:26.779 --> 01:56:28.414
OR WHAT I LIKE.

01:56:28.481 --> 01:56:29.782
TO THINK OF IS MORE OF A PIT OF

01:56:29.849 --> 01:56:31.184
BUDGETARY DESPAIR.

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:33.453
THAT WE ARE ON BURDEN BY.

01:56:33.519 --> 01:56:35.321
INTO THE FUTURE AND SO I THANK

01:56:35.388 --> 01:56:37.990
YOU. FOR THAT DISCIPLINE OVER

01:56:38.057 --> 01:56:39.292
ALL OF THOSE YEARS AND I'M

01:56:39.359 --> 01:56:40.460
GRATEFUL THAT GOVERNOR NEW SOME

01:56:40.526 --> 01:56:42.128
HAS HELPED US TO FINISH THIS OFF

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:43.763
SO THAT HE THAT HE DOESN'T ALSO

01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:46.199
NEED TO BE WEIGHTED DOWN.

01:56:46.265 --> 01:56:47.934
DURING HIS TIME AS GOVERNOR.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.902
I DID HEAR SOMETHING EARLIER

01:56:49.969 --> 01:56:52.538
THAT -- THAT OFFENDED ME THOUGH.

01:56:52.605 --> 01:56:54.841
AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

01:56:54.907 --> 01:56:59.312
THE WAY THAT WE FIND THINGS IN

01:56:59.379 --> 01:57:00.847
THAT ARE MEMBERS OF OUR

01:57:00.913 --> 01:57:02.014
COMMUNITY.

01:57:02.081 --> 01:57:03.383
WE WERE TOLD THAT WE'RE DOING

01:57:03.449 --> 01:57:04.951
SOMETHING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

01:57:05.017 --> 01:57:06.486
AMERICAN.

01:57:06.552 --> 01:57:08.454
WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC AND AN

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:10.390
ECONOMY.

01:57:10.456 --> 01:57:12.525
AND AND IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.

01:57:12.592 --> 01:57:14.894
THAT DON'T WORK TOGETHER BUT

01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:16.662
DEPEND ON ONE ANOTHER AND THE

01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:18.331
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:19.866
WON'T TAKE A DANCE LESSON TO

01:57:19.932 --> 01:57:21.367
FIGURE THAT OUT.

CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING.

IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:02:58.738 --> 02:02:59.905
I HAVE TWO CONCERNS WITH THIS

02:02:59.972 --> 02:03:05.845
BUDGET. ONE IS EDUCATION

[inaudible]

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:09.248
YOU KNOW.

02:03:09.315 --> 02:03:10.449
WHAT THE BUDGET CHAIR IS IS

02:03:10.516 --> 02:03:12.651
CORRECT THAT WE ARE ALLOCATING

02:03:12.718 --> 02:03:13.619
EIGHTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:15.654
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS

02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:17.490
MORE DOLLARS IN ANY OTHER TIME?

02:03:17.556 --> 02:03:18.491
AW.

02:03:18.557 --> 02:03:21.160
IN OUR HISTORY.

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:22.828
I HAD TO CONFIRM YESTERDAY IN

02:03:22.895 --> 02:03:24.263
OUR BUDGET BRIEFING THAT THAT IS

02:03:24.330 --> 02:03:25.865
STILL.

02:03:25.931 --> 02:03:28.400
THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE UNDER

02:03:28.467 --> 02:03:30.302
PROPOSITION.

02:03:30.369 --> 02:03:31.103
NINETY EIGHT AND IT DISAPPOINTS

02:03:31.170 --> 02:03:34.240
ME THAT IN THIS YEAR WELL WE HAD

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:36.976
OUR LA USC STRIKE OR OAKLAND

02:03:37.042 --> 02:03:39.912

NEW HAVEN.

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:44.717
WE CAN ONLY STILL FIND AT THE

02:03:44.784 --> 02:03:49.655
MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF PROPOSITION.

02:03:49.722 --> 02:03:50.723
NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE

02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:54.326
MEANS THAT LET'S NOT BE FULL BY.

02:03:54.393 --> 02:03:57.096
THE DOLLAR AMOUNT WE ARE JUST

02:03:57.163 --> 02:03:59.031
ALLOCATING THE MINIMUM.

02:03:59.098 --> 02:04:00.866
THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO ALLOCATE

DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.

02:07:03.148 --> 02:07:04.450
WE ALL HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

02:07:04.516 --> 02:07:06.085
WE AREN'T DOING ENOUGH.

02:07:06.151 --> 02:07:07.386
AND WE'LL DO NEED TO DO VERY

02:07:07.453 --> 02:07:09.588
MUCH MORE.

02:07:09.655 --> 02:07:11.357
MAYBE EVEN THIS YEAR.

02:07:11.423 --> 02:07:13.625
AS A POSSIBILITY.

02:07:13.692 --> 02:07:14.827
FIRST THIS BUDGET PROVIDES

02:07:14.893 --> 02:07:16.295
FUNDING BUT DOESN'T START UNTIL

02:07:16.362 --> 02:07:18.297
JANUARY FIRST.

02:07:18.364 --> 02:07:19.598
AND THE FACT IS THAT SOME

02:07:19.665 --> 02:07:20.199
PROGRAMS JUST CAN'T WAIT THAT

02:07:20.265 --> 02:07:22.167
LONG.

02:07:22.234 --> 02:07:23.235
SECOND THE BUDGET GIVE SOME

02:07:23.302 --> 02:07:25.771
FUNDING TO SOME OF THE PROGRAMS.

02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:27.706
BELIEVES MANY OUT.

02:07:27.773 --> 02:07:29.675
AND THAT'S JUST WRONG.

02:07:29.742 --> 02:07:30.776
THESE PROGRAMS ARE STRUGGLING

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:32.778
BECAUSE OUR STATE.

02:07:32.845 --> 02:07:34.880
PAST LEGISLATORS AND GOVERNORS.

02:07:34.947 --> 02:07:36.148
HAVE ONLY GIVEN THE SYSTEM TO

02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:38.450
INCREASES IN TWENTY YEARS.

02:07:38.517 --> 02:07:39.585
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION

02:07:39.651 --> 02:07:41.220
REJECTED GIVING INCREASES TO

02:07:41.286 --> 02:07:42.688
SOME PROGRAMS A BELIEVE WILL BE

02:07:42.755 --> 02:07:44.123
OUT OF FAVOR UNDER FEDERAL

02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:45.524
GUIDELINES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO

02:07:45.591 --> 02:07:46.725
BE IMPLEMENTED.

02:07:46.792 --> 02:07:48.861
IN.

02:07:48.927 --> 02:07:50.062
TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT THESE

02:07:50.129 --> 02:07:51.330
TODAY THESE PROGRAMS ARE

02:07:51.397 --> 02:07:52.765
PROVIDING SERVICES SELECTED

02:07:52.831 --> 02:07:55.300
PEOPLE WITH IDT IN FAMILIES.

02:07:55.367 --> 02:07:56.735
APPROVED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER

02:07:56.802 --> 02:07:58.103
IN THEIR AREA AND YOUR AREA AND

02:07:58.170 --> 02:08:00.305
MY DISTRICT.

02:08:00.372 --> 02:08:01.240
UNTIL WE HAVE A PLAN FOR OTHER

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:03.809
OPTIONS WE SIMPLY CANNOT ABANDON

02:08:03.876 --> 02:08:05.044
THESE PROGRAMS ARREST THEM

02:08:05.110 --> 02:08:07.246
FAILING BECAUSE WE THINK WE

02:08:07.312 --> 02:08:07.780
MIGHT NOT RECEIVE FEDERAL

02:08:07.846 --> 02:08:11.016
FUNDING. THREE YEARS FROM NOW.

02:08:11.083 --> 02:08:12.551
THIRD THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:08:12.618 --> 02:08:13.752
DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SAID THEY

02:08:13.819 --> 02:08:15.254
MADE THE CHOICES TO FUND

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:16.488
PROGRAMS THEY DID.

02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:18.357
BASED UPON THE RATE STUDY THAT

02:08:18.424 --> 02:08:20.259
THAT WAS RELEASED IN LATE MARCH.

02:08:20.325 --> 02:08:22.694
BUT WE ALL NEED TO KEEP IN MIND

02:08:22.761 --> 02:08:24.029
THAT THIS RATE STUDY IS NOT.

02:08:24.096 --> 02:08:26.131
FINALIZEDAND NOT ACCURATE IN

02:08:26.198 --> 02:08:28.434
MANY PLACES.

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:29.668
THE DEPARTMENT TOOK IN CONTENTS

02:08:29.735 --> 02:08:32.204
FROM THE PUBLIC.

02:08:32.271 --> 02:08:32.771
WHICH INCLUDED.

02:08:32.838 --> 02:08:34.907
MANY ADDRESSING THE FLAWS IN THE

02:08:34.973 --> 02:08:35.874
STUDY.

02:08:35.941 --> 02:08:37.409
AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS YET TO

02:08:37.476 --> 02:08:39.378
ANSWER THESE COMMENTS.

02:08:39.445 --> 02:08:41.747
WE NEED ANSWERS AND IT'S OUR JOB

02:08:41.814 --> 02:08:42.848
TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT

02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:44.817
NECESSARY. TO COMPEL THEM TO

02:08:44.883 --> 02:08:47.352
ANSWER.

02:08:47.419 --> 02:08:51.824
AND TO PUT A PLAN INTO PLACE.

02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:52.891
LASTLY THE RACE THAT HE SAYS WE

02:08:52.958 --> 02:08:54.960
ARE UNDER FINING THE SYSTEM BY

02:08:55.027 --> 02:08:57.696
ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS

02:08:57.763 --> 02:09:00.099
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S AN ACCURATE

02:09:00.165 --> 02:09:01.066
AMOUNT ALSO I THINK IT'S MORE

02:09:01.133 --> 02:09:03.602
THAN THAT.

02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:06.038
THIS BUDGET RESPONDS WITH A ONE

02:09:06.105 --> 02:09:06.672
HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION

02:09:06.738 --> 02:09:07.539

02:09:07.606 --> 02:09:08.941
AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT

02:09:09.007 --> 02:09:10.876
MILLION ANNUALLY.

02:09:10.943 --> 02:09:14.246
WE'RE KIND OF SHORT.

02:09:14.313 --> 02:09:15.647
AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING WE'RE

02:09:15.714 --> 02:09:16.548
SHORTING THEM.

02:09:16.615 --> 02:09:17.850
BY ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OR

02:09:17.916 --> 02:09:19.251
MORE.

02:09:19.318 --> 02:09:23.255
AND WE NEED TO DO MUCH MUCH MORE.

02:09:23.322 --> 02:09:25.457
WE'RE ALL BLESSED IN THIS ROOM

02:09:25.524 --> 02:09:28.260

02:09:28.327 --> 02:09:29.995
