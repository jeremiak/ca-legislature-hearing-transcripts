00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:08.921
NUMBER OF PROBLEMS SPECIFICALLY

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.890
ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE REGISTERED

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:12.291
FOR A PARTY THEY DIDN'T USED TO

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:14.093
BE AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.661
ACTUALLY THAT WAS BIPARTISAN

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.230

GUESS REGISTER TO VOTE WHEN

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:05.344
REAL PROBLEM FOR FAMILIES ON

MISTER GORDON AS OUR PARENTS GO

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.615
BACK TO WORK. AS BUSINESSES ARE

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:11.250
OPENING IN CHILDREN WILL BE

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:13.753
RESPONSIBLE- FOR GETTING

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:14.987
THEMSELVES WHERE THEY NEED TO

TO BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE THAT.

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:28.401
IN THE NEAR TERM- OF AB

BE ON YOUR MIND ANNUAL THEY

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:34.206
HAVE DONE THAT IN THE STATE OF

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:36.075
COLORADO. SO THOSE TWO ISSUES

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:37.977
ARE HIGH ON MY LIST. AND

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:39.712
LOOKING AT YOUR RESUME I THINK

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:40.646
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:42.014
SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL BE VERY

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.383
ACCOMPLISHED OUT. OF YOU KNOW

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.886
DEALING SO. EITHER GIVING YOU A

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:52.391
HIGH FIVE SO LET'S HEAR. WHAT

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:52.959
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME

00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:54.260
WITH. THANK YOU SAID OUT

00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:56.429
PRECIADO. THE CONFIDENCE. I'M

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:57.630
MOTOR VOTER ON AS THAT MANY OF

00:09:57.697 --> 00:10:00.466
YOUR- THE- PROGRAM HAS TO START

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:01.667
UP SAID THAT'S KIND OF HOW I

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:02.702
THINK EITHER ERNST AND YOUNG

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.036
ASSESSMENT THAT WAS JUST UNDER

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.404
WAY WHEN I WHEN I JOINED.

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:07.139
REALLY I HIGHLIGHTED I THINK

00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:08.541
TWO THINGS ONE IS THERE IS A

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:10.476
GOVERNMENT ISSUE BETWEEN THE

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:13.546
VARIOUS PARTIES PRIMARILY THE

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:14.180
DMV AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:15.481
AND I MET WITH THE SECRETARY OF

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:17.049
STATE AND WE HAD I THINK A

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.317
REALLY GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:19.552
HOW WE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:20.920
GOVERNMENT'S MAKING SURE

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.221
THERE'S CLEAR COMMUNICATION

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.690
ABOUT WHAT THE SCOPE IS. TESTED

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:25.825
WHO TEST WHAT WHAT SUCCESS

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.793
LOOKS LIKE. AND I THINK WE

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.130
FOUND DOES TO. CLARIFYING THE

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:32.531
SCOPE HAVING VERY FREQUENT

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:33.532
MEETINGS CERTAINLY AND THE AND

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:35.634
IN THE EARLY WEEKS. WE'VE BEEN

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.771
ABLE TO REALLY TIGHTEN UP OUR

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:39.638
ABILITY TO EXECUTE ON. SO I

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:40.773
THINK RIGHT IS WHAT I'VE SEEN

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.274
IS THAT. FROM THAT THE

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:43.142
GOVERNMENT BETWEEN THE TWO

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.777
ARMOS THINGS ARE WORKING AS AS

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:46.612
WELL AS THEY'VE EVER DONE AND

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:48.314
WE'RE SEEING THAT. THINGS MAKE

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:49.348
AN INTRODUCTION RELEASE IS

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:51.584
BEING MADE. WITH NO DEFECTS IN

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.318
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY A VERY

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:54.086
DIFFERENT. FEELING THAN WHAT IT

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.588
WAS SIX MONTHS AGO I THINK THE

00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:56.288
TEAM IS WORKING WERE THERE

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.057
AWHILE TOGETHER. A LOT OF

00:10:58.124 --> 00:10:59.558
OPPORTUNITY. AND BUT I THINK

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:00.559
RIGHT NOW THINGS ARE GOING WELL

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:01.961
ON THE OPERATION SIDE AND I'LL

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:02.595
GET BACK TO YOUR QUESTION

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:05.898
SENATOR- ABOUT. SOME OF THESE.

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:08.067
ISSUES BUT THE ARMY OPERATIONS

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:09.201
I WHICH IS THE OTHER FAT FAST

00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:10.302
ENOUGH TO SAY WE NEED TO MAKE

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:11.704
SURE THAT WE- HOPE THAT. AS

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:13.205
SERIOUSLY AS IT NEEDED TO BE

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:14.907
AND WE ALSO. RECEIVED FUNDING

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:15.708
FROM THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:16.976
WHERE IT SHOULD BE FUNDED. WE

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:18.210
HAVE DEDICATED TEAM TO MAKE

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:22.114
SURE THAT THAT PROCESS WORKS.

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:22.715
AS EFFICIENTLY AS AGAIN THERE

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:24.417
ARE. FEDERAL GUIDELINES. OF

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.552
DAYS. PROCESS THE TEAM HAS PUT

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:28.020
RIGHT MEASURES IN PLACE TO MAKE

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:28.888
SURE THOSE THINGS MAKE IT

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.222
THROUGH THE SYSTEM TO THE

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:31.424
SECRETARY STATE AND EVENTUALLY

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.426
TO THE REGISTER VOTERS WITHIN

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:35.628
THE TIME FRAMES- DICTATED BY

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:37.496
LAW IT'S NOT PROCESS HAS BEEN

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:39.565
VERY WELL MEASURED OF LATE- IN

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.067
AGAIN VERY WELL EXECUTED OF

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:42.968
LATE I THINK THE TEAM IS FIXED.

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:44.136
TWO OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS CAN

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:44.937
GOVERNOR'S BETWEEN THE

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:46.272
DEPARTMENTS AND MAKING SURE

00:11:46.338 --> 00:11:47.973
OPERATIONALLY THAT WHERE WE

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.442
HAVE OUR AYE IF YOU WILL ON THE

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:51.277
BALL NOW I KNOW THERE'S BEEN

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:53.512
SOME CONCERNS RAISED BY SOME

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:55.881
SOME PARTS WHERE- SOMETHING HAD

00:11:55.948 --> 00:11:57.216
CHANGED SO AND I KNOW THAT THE

00:11:57.283 --> 00:12:02.188
PROCESS IS- IS A BIT CONFUSING

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:02.721
ABOUT. WHEN YOU'RE A SE.

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:04.056
REQUESTING A DUPLICATE DRIVER'S

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.591
LICENSE OR DOING A CHANGE OF

00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:06.125
ADDRESS WHERE WE TAKE YOU

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:07.860
THROUGH THE- THE MOTOR VOTER

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:11.764
PROCESS AGAIN. AND TO THE BEST

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:12.531
COMPLEX AND WE'RE WORKING TO

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.900
SIMPLIFY IT. THE ITEMS THAT

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:15.801
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD OUT

00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:17.770
FROM- VARIOUS GOT CONSTITUENTS

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:19.171
IN THE FIELD I THINK HAVE BEEN.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.406
LOOKING THAT OUR DEPARTMENT I

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:21.407
THINK ALSO THROUGH THE

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:22.541
SECRETARY STATE. I'M NOT SURE

00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:24.443
WE FOUND. MANY IF ANY AND I

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.378
APOLOGIZE. IF THERE ARE SOME

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:27.780
THAT YOU'RE AWARE BUT- WHERE

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:29.115
YOU KNOW WE ARE SOME SOMEHOW

00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:30.216
INADVERTENTLY THINGS WERE

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:31.517
CHANGED. BUT BECAUSE OF THE

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.419
COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCESS IS

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:35.087
WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IT. THAT

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:37.990
IT'S VERY EASY TO. NOT KEEP

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.625
YOUR MOTOR VOTER PREFERENCES

00:12:39.692 --> 00:12:40.893
STATIC WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.161
CHANGES I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:43.028
THAT'S COMING OUT IN A FUTURE

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:45.064
RELEASE SO THAT. WE WON'T.

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:46.999
NOBODY WILL HAVE. BE BE

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:48.334
CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT WHAT BUT

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.136
DISLIKE ON AND SO ON SO I THINK

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:51.770
AGAIN. A HIGH LEVEL OF THE

00:12:51.837 --> 00:12:52.972
MOTOR VOTER IS IN A VERY VERY

00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:54.373
GOOD STATE WE NEED TO CONTINUE

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.441
TO WATCH FOR THOSE ITEMS THAT

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:59.478
YOU MENTIONED. WE. TAKE THIS

00:12:59.545 --> 00:12:59.979
VERY SERIOUSLY AS I WAS

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:00.546
CONCERNED. COME IN AND MAKE

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:01.180
SURE THAT WE GET TO THE BOTTOM

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:03.015
OF ISSUES SO THAT. IF THERE IS

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:04.550
A DEFECT OF SOME SORT THAT WE

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.519
ADDRESS THAT. NOW YOU TALK

00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:07.987
ABOUT TRIED TO **** DRIVE JUST

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:09.355
IS LIKE THE NUMBER ONE EMAIL

00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:10.823
THAT I GET. AND I DO RESPONDED

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.224
MANY BECAUSE REGION I'M NOT

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.058
ASKING FOR MORE FROM YOUR

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:14.460
CONSTITUENTS BUT- IT'S REALLY

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:15.995
GOOD TO BE. IN TOUCH WITH OUR

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:18.164
WITH OUR COMMUNITY. AND WE WANT

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.598
TO MAKE SURE THAT IN FACT WE DO

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:21.300
RESPOND APPROPRIATELY I'M DR

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.668
DOES HELP. S WE OPEN UP OUR

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:23.969
NEXT WE'VE LOST AS WE'VE BEEN

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:25.838
OPENING IN THREE WAYS THE NEXT

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:26.772
WAVE OPEN SOMETIME MIDDLE OF

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.440
THIS MONTH. AND THAT WILL START

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:30.309
TO INCLUDE DRIVE COUSIN. WHY WE

00:13:30.376 --> 00:13:31.677
PUT THAT IN THE LAST PHASES

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:33.112
SOCIAL DISTANCING WHILE ON A

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:35.214
CAR IS CHALLENGING RIGHT. IT'S

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:36.081
A WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE RIGHT

00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:38.117
PP IN PLACE THE RECORD FEATURES

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:41.520
IN PLACE. AS A LOT OF PRE AND

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:42.121
POST WE'RE GONNA TEST. BUT WE

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:43.088
BELIEVE WILL HAVE THAT STOOD

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:44.957
UP. THIS MONTH. AND THEN WE'VE-

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:46.358
ALSO STREAMLINED THE PROCESS SO

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:47.927
WE HAVE THINGS THAT ARE DRIVE

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:48.961
BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD NORMALLY

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:50.930
DO. YES SOUP TO NUTS IN THE

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:52.531
PROCESS WE NOW. SEPARATE IS

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:53.532
SOME OF THAT WORK SO THEY CAN

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:54.500
STAY FOCUSED ON THE DRIVE HAS

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:56.001
TO BE EFFICIENT. GET A FEW MORE

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:57.903
DRIVES IN EVERY DAY. AND SO

00:51:57.013 --> 00:51:58.381
PLAYERS TO PLAY CERTAIN GAMES

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:00.150

MAKE LESS MONEY ON. BUT THEY'RE

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.908
VERY POPULAR AND THAT'S WHY

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:26.710
SCRATCHERS GAMES THE INSTANT

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:29.412

DOLLARS. AND SO I'M GOING TO

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:47.697
ASK WILL WHY WOULD SOMEONE BY

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:49.633

00:52:49.699 --> 00:52:50.800
OUR CORE PLAYERS LOVE THOSE

VARIOUS STYLES AND BERRIES PLAY

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:56.306
WHAT. FOR AND SO WE FOUND THAT

00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:57.874
WHEN WE INTRODUCED THOSE GAMES

00:52:57.941 --> 00:52:59.643
WE WERE ABLE TO GENERATE EVEN

00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:01.778
MORE SALES WITH THOSE

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.246

EARLIER AND AS EVERYBODY KNOWS

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:19.496
THE NET PROFITS WE TAKE THOSE

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:21.698
SALES MINUS THE COST OF THE

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:23.199

HIGHER SALES. OUR THIS. SALES

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:44.354
WERE FLAT BY ABOUT THREE OR

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:45.755
FOUR YEARS THERE WAS NO BROKE.

00:53:45.822 --> 00:53:46.723
AND THE LOTTERIES MISSION AS

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:47.657
SET FORTH IN THE LOTTERY ACT

00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:49.559
ABOUT THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO WAS

00:53:49.626 --> 00:53:51.361
TO MAXIMIZE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:53:51.428 --> 00:53:52.729
FUNDING FOR EDUCATION TO DO

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.564
EVERYTHING IT COULD. TO RAISE

00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:56.299
MORE MONEY FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:57.734
SO WITH FLAT SALES THERE HAD TO

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:59.102
BE A CHANGE IN THE WAY THE

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:00.337
LOTTERY DID THINGS TO GENERATE

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:02.305
MORE SALES. AND AS I EXPLAINED

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:04.240
THE LOTTERY IF THIS AFTER THE

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:05.508
LEGISLATURE GRAND THAT CHANGE

00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:07.243
LAW BY OFFERING MORE AND BETTER

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:09.012
PRICES IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:09.946
WHICH ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE SOME

00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:11.982
PLAYERS AND THUS. GENERATING

00:54:12.048 --> 00:54:13.516
HIGHER SALES AND AS I EXPLAINED

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.552
OF THE LAST NINE YEARS WE'VE

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:17.220
INCREASED THE CONTRIBUTION

00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:19.089
RESULTING FROM THE SALES TO

00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:21.958
EDUCATION. FROM ONE MILLION TO

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:22.459
ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:25.128
DOLLARS. SO I THINK ULTIMATELY

00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:27.797
THE METRIC SHOULD BE. HOW IS

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:29.599
THE CONTRIBUTION EDUCATION

00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:31.635
GROWN OVER TIME. IT WAS FLAG

00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:33.870
BEFORE THE CHANGED YEARS AGO

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:34.404
NOW IT'S INCREASING ON A

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:36.439
REGULAR RATE. I DO TO RECENT

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:38.308
EVENTS REPUBLICAN HAS IT BEEN

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:40.043
WHICH USUALLY A BIT OF A CHANGE

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.379
IN THAT HOWEVER OUR THREE YEAR

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:43.847
STRATEGIC PLAN WHICH STILL HAS

00:54:43.913 --> 00:54:44.481
TO BE APPROVED BY THE

00:54:44.547 --> 00:54:47.017
COMMISSION. HAS A GOAL OF

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.051
REACHING THE LEVEL OF

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:51.921
CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC.

00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:52.422
EDUCATION OF TWO BILLION

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:53.289
DOLLARS. SO WE'RE ALWAYS ON A-

00:54:53.356 --> 00:54:54.691
TO GENERATE MONEY FOR SCHOOLS

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:56.259
AND LOOKING FOR MORE AND BETTER

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:59.562
WAYS TO DO THAT. SO JUST GET TO

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:00.864
GET BACK TO MY FIRST QUESTION

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.699
YOU ANSWERED IT UP. THE ****

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:03.867
ACCOUNTS FOR THE DIFFERENCE

00:55:03.933 --> 00:55:05.802
BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND 5015%

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:07.570
AND SIXTY SIX PERCENT. IS THE

00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:08.872
INCREASE IN THE PIES IN THE

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:11.174
PRIZE POT. THE AMOUNT OF PRIZE

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:13.309
MONEY THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED-

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:14.844
THROUGH THE LOTTERY CORRECT.

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:15.945
THAT'S RIGHT WE SAT HIGHER

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:18.948
PAYOUTS ON SOME GAMES AND THAT

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:20.784
IS BASICALLY DRIVEN SALES. NOW

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:21.951
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:22.752
THERE'S A REQUIREMENT IN THE
