AND I'M PRESENTING SB -- SEVEN SIXTY SIX AS THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE KEENLY AWARE OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE TAKEN EXTRAORDINARY STRIDES AND SMART ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND WATER CONSERVATION. THIS MEASURE -- THE REPRESENTS STEP TWO FOOT ISSUES REGULATIONS ARE BY THE WAY. THAT TO TO TO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES ARE HE IS SIMPLE CHANGES BUT I NEVER USE THE WORD SIMPLE AND LEGISLATION OTHERWISE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY A PRESS RELEASE USE WORDS SIMPLE. TWO VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES MEANINGFUL CHANGES FIRST. THE BILL ALIGNS WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM GUIDELINES -- FOR PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES AND INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ALLOWING PUBLIC YOUR OWN UTILITIES TO IMPLEMENT NEW ENERGY MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS SECOND. THE BILL GIVES US -- THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND PUBLIC OWNED UTILITIES A NEW TOOL TO GET IT TO CONSIDER IN WEATHER'S ATION PROGRAMS -- WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES THAT RESULT IN SAVINGS. FUNDAMENTALLY THIS MEASURE FURTHER INVESTORS ARE SUCCESSFUL LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM OF FROM WHICH NIGHT TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN DEPLOYED ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. TO SERVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS BY APPARENTLY MORE THAN TWO AND FIFTY THOUSAND METRIC TONS. ON SO WITH THAT I WILL GIVE YOU ANDREA DIVO BUT TO US TO TALK ABOUT IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I CAN MORNING AT YOUR HUESO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANDREA DIVO I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF RECON DYNAMICS. A TECH COMPANY THAT STANDS AT THE NEXUS OF TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT AND MODERNIZATION PROVIDING ASSET TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE UTILITY COMPANIES TO OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY. RECON DYNAMICS IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL SEVEN SIX SIX THREE THANK SENATOR STERN AND NOW SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS MEASURE. I SENATE BILL SEVEN SIX SIX IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL OPEN THE DOOR FOR THE STATE TO LEVERAGE ABOUT THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAMS. TO ALSO YOU UTILIZE WATER EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES TO INCREASE ENERGY SAVINGS. AS CALIFORNIA'S STRIVES TO DEPLOY ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS LIKE THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM UTILITY COMPANIES WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING THOSE MEASURES AND RECON DYNAMICS IS READY TO HELP SUPPORT THE ACHIEVEMENT. OF THOSE GOALS SET FORTH IN THE EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THANK YOU FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT AFTER I VOTE THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER. INDIVIDUALS IN THE AUDIENCE WILL YOU SPEAK AND SUPPORTER OPPOSITION. ANY SPEAKERS [inaudible] ANY COMMENTS. CHEN I'D LIKE TO IF I COULD OFFER A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT THAT WOULD BE OKAY THAT THIS THAT BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THIS MORNING THIS BILL APPLIES TO ALL JURISDICTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA EXCEPT. A CENTER STERN SENATORIAL DISTRICT [inaudible] READ THROUGH. I'M I'M STILL AT A LOSS TO WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY DOES SO CAN -- TO ONE NUMERATOR. SO I'M IT WILL IMPROVE WEATHER IS ASIAN PROGRAMS -- IT DIRECTS THE CC AND THE AND THE PC TO CONSIDER COST EFFECTIVENESS WHEN CONSIDERING THE IMPLANTATION OF WEATHER IS ATION MEASURES -- AND LOW INCOME DWELLINGS IT'S AN EXTENSION OF THE OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM I UNDERSTAND BUT POR FOLKS JUST IN THE NATURE BEEN POOR ALWAYS CONSERVE WATER -- THEY HAVE A LOWER USAGE IN THE STATE SO I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT WE EXPANDING APART? IS THERE A PENALTY IF THEY DON'T SAY. YEAH THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S NO PENALTY IT'S MORE OF A SORT OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH BUSINESSES SMART METERS WHICH THEY ALREADY HAVE INSTALLED TOGETHER TO ALLOW THEM. TO SO THIS IS START INSTALLING SMART METERS AND THESE LOW INCOME. THE SMART METERS RD AND SIT IN THE BILL ALSO SAYS INCLUDES ATTIC INSULATION CAULKING WEATHER STRIPPING. LOW FLOW SHOWERHEADS WATER HEADLINE WATER HEATER BLANKETS DOOR AND BUILDING ENVELOPE REPAIRS WHICH REDUCE AIR THAT ON FOR THE THOSE VARIOUS FACTORS. THANK YOU OF SIR MORE LIKE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D I'D TO A LITTLE CONFUSED SO I'M JUST CURIOUS -- YOU MENTION WATER EFFICIENCY TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE REDUCE ENERGY AND YOU MENTIONED LOW FLOW SHOWERHEADS. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES THAT RESULT IN ENERGY SAVINGS. WE'LL BE LIKE A NEW WATER HEATER THAT USES LESS ELECTRICITY YOUR YES I'VE JUST EVERYTHING WHAT EVERYTHING MOVING WATER IS IS IT THERE'S A CORRELATION DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO THE ECHO ENERGY COSTS ROSE TO THE CALIFORNIA MOVE WATERS EXTRAORDINARY. SO THE STATE YOU CAN CONSERVE WATER CONSERVE ENERGY THERE'S A NEXUS BETWEEN THE TWO NOT JUST WITH RESPECT TO MOVING WATER FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH. OR FROM TWO US SOLVENCY. HOURS OF TALK OF THE CITY BUT BUT IT ALSO. IT IS A CORRELATION SO THE MORE YOU CAN SAY WATER THE MORE YOU SAVE ENERGY. THEN HOW DOES THAT HELP. IN THE CASES CENTER BRADFORD'S. LINE OF QUESTIONING ARE WE GIVING NEW WATER HEATERS. TO NOT WHAT WOULD I WORK WE COULD INSTALL PROJECTS THAT HAVE SOLAR HEATERS TO WATER THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE USE OF GAS FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS A WILL [inaudible] BUT AND AND THAT IS IN THE AREA OF ENERGY CONSERVATION AS AN EXAMPLE. I JUST DIDN'T SEE HOW WATER CONSERVATION COULD MEAN INSTALLING. LOWER FLUSH TOILETS NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS SAVINGS AND WATER IN THE WAY. SHOWERS OPERATE THE WAY TOILETS OPERATE SINKS EVERYTHING ELSE. SODEXHO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MANY. I WOULD. GO OKAY. OKAY WE DO WE HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION BY.
