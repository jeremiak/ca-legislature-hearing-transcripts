TUESDAY MARCH TWENTY NINTH. WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM IN FACT WE DON'T HAVE ANY MEMBERS HERE YET SO I'M GONNA WAIT FOR A LITTLE BIT. TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME OTHER MEMBERS HERE BUT IF NOT WE WILL START PRESENTLY AS A- SUB COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN GET MOVING ON OUR BILL SO. LITTLE BIT OF PATIENCE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT EVENTHOUGH WE HAVE A DISTINCT LACK OF MEMBERS HAD- GOING TO START THIS IS A SUB COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN GET THROUGH. ALL OF THE BILLS THAT WE HAVE SO WILL BEGIN WITH ITEM NUMBER ONE AB EIGHTEEN OH NINE. MS AGUIAR-CURRY. AND THANKS TO THE AUTHORS FOR BEING HERE ON TIME. SORRY ABOUT THE LACK OF MEMBERS OKAY. YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL ADJUSTING TO THE NEW NORM ABOUT RUNNING BACK AND FORTH DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE OFF MY- I DO NOT MIND OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHAIRMEN STONE AND- MEMBERS. OF FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS INCLUDED THROUGHOUT THE ANALYSIS AND THANK YOUR STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL WORK ON THIS BILL. YOU KNOW IT'S A SAD REALITY THAT SOME NURSING HOMES UNITED STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA RETURN RETURN. RETURN LINK TO ANYWAY. I CAN SERVE THIS MORNING IT'S A GOOD ANTI PSYCHOTIC DRUGS TO RESIDENTS WITH DEMENTIA TO CONTROL THE BEHAVIOR DESPITE RULES AGAINST THE MISUSE OF SUCH DRUGS AS CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS. THESE CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS ARE BEING PRESCRIBED TO SEDATE AND SUBDUE RESIDENTS WHO OFTEN USE BEHAVIOR TO- COMMUNICATE THEY'RE PAYING THEIR DISCOMFORT OR DISTRESS AB EIGHTEEN OH NINE WILL HELP STEM THIS PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH THIS ABUSIVE PRACTICE HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD. BASED ON THE RESEARCHERS VISITS TO MORE THAN A HUNDRED NURSING FACILITIES IN SIX STATES OR MORE. AND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE LIVING FACILITIES THE FAMILY STAFF LONG TERM CARE AND DISABILITY EXPERTS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ADVOCATES. HUMAN RIGHTS RIGHTS WATCH REPORT THEY WANT DOCILE HOW NURSING HOMES IN THE UNITED STATES OVER MEDICATE PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA ESTIMATES THAT EVERY WEEK THE UNITED STATES NURSING FACILITIES MORE THAN A HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE. MOSTLY THOSE SHOULDER THE OLDER AND LIVING WITH DEMENTIA ARE GIVEN ANTI PSYCHOTIC DRUGS WITH OUT A APPROPRIATE DIAGNOSIS AT A PSYCHOTIC DRUGS WERE DEVELOPED TO TREAT PSYCHIATRIC. CONDITIONS LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE AND DRUG WITH THE STRONGEST BLACK BOX WARNING WITHOUT THE RISK WITH ABOUT THE RISKS THAT THEY POSE TO PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA. THE FDA HAS NEVER APPROVED ANTI SOUGHT PSYCHOTIC DRUGS AS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR THE TREATMENT OF THE VICTIM DEMENTIA SYMPTOMS. STUDIES FINEST ANTI PSYCHOTIC DRUGS NEARLY DOUBLE THE RISK OF DEATH IN OLDER PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA WHEN THE DRUGS ARE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT INFORMED CONSENT. INS AND THE FARMERS ARE NOT MAKING THE CHOICE TO TAKE SUCH A RISK. AB EIGHTEEN OH NINE A BUILDS ON EXISTING PROTECTIONS FOR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS IN STATE LAW AND REGULATED. IT WE WILL CUT IT'LL CUT A FINE EXPAND RULES TO ESTABLISH A NURSING HOMES RESIDENTS RIGHT TO PROVIDE OR WITHHOLD WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT. PERTAINING TO THE USE OF SPENT A THERAPEUTIC DRUGS AND THE RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM CHEMICAL RESTRAINT. WILL SPECIFY THAT RESIDENTS AND REPRESENTATIVES MUST BE INFORMED IN WRITING ABOUT THE CUT CONTENT WITH THE BLACK BOX WARNINGS FOR PROPOSED DRUGS AND WHETHER THE PER DRUGS PROPOSED USE. HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA FDA. REQUIRES THE STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO EVALUATE NURSING FACILITY COMPLIANCE WITH THESE PROVISIONS DURING PERIODIC STATE LICENSE INSPECTIONS. I'D LIKE TO PRESENT MY TWO WITNESSES ATTORNEY CHECK UNTIL THE STAFF ATTORNEY FOR THE BILL'S SPONSOR THE CALIFORNIA'S FOR NURSING HOME REFORM AND BE A REMOTE TESTIMONY IS MATT BOREDOM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING I'M TONY CHECK ITSELF FROM CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. AS ONE TALK TO YOU REAL QUICKLY ABOUT TWO THINGS ONE THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR THIS BILL. A SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT WE SPONSORED AND THOUSAND NINE SB THREE OH THREE WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT WOULD OF- CODIFIED PRE EXISTING STATE REGULATIONS ON INFORMED CONSENT. AND ENHANCE THEM- THE WE GET THE BILL THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE BUT GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER VETOED IT AND IN HIS VETO MESSAGE. BASICALLY SAID I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THERE'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE LET'S LOOK AT IT. OF A COUPLE YEARS LATER THIS ISSUE ERUPTED NATIONALLY THERE WAS AN OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT THERE WAS- SENATE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND THEN THIS. BIG NATIONAL CAMPAIGN THAT WAS ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO GET PROVIDERS TO VOLUNTARILY REDUCE THEIR USE. OF PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS IN NURSING HOMES. AND FOR THE MOST PART THERE WAS SOME SUCCESS WE THE RATES WENT DOWN A YEAR AFTER YEAR GRADUALLY. TILL ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN AND THEN THE MOMENTUM OF THE CAMPAIGN REALLY. STARTED TO EXHAUST ITSELF AND THE RATES FLATTENED AND SINCE THEN THEY'VE COME BACK UP ESPECIALLY. DURING THE PANDEMIC AND IT'S BEEN- PRETTY DISPIRITING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. SO THE TIME HAS COME- TO DO WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND HAVE A WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT LAW. THE SECOND CONCEPT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST VERY BRIEFLY IS THAT INFORMED CONSENT FOR THE MOST PART IN NURSING HOMES HAS BEEN A SHAM. PROCESS RESIDENTS IF THEY GET ANY INFORMATION AT ALL ABOUT THESE DRUGS IT USUALLY JUST. BITS AND PIECES OF INFORMATION IT'S NOT A VERY COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATION THEY'RE HAVING WITH THEIR PRESCRIBER. I'VE BEEN GOING INTO NURSING HOMES AND ADVOCATING FOR RESIDENTS FOR NINETEEN YEARS NOW. I'VE BEEN I'VE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME AND FACILITIES TALKING TO RESIDENTS. IN THEIR ROMS AND I HAVE YET. TO EVER SEE A PRESCRIBER IN THE ROOM WITH THE RESIDENT. AT THE TIME E. VALUE WAITING THE CONDITION OF THEIR PATIENT. SO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT RESIDENTS ARE GETTING- THAT I'M NOT REALLY THIS BILL IS NOT REALLY FOCUSED THE CONVERSATION THE PRESCRIBER SHOULD BE HAVING WITH THEIR PATIENTS ABOUT THE INFORMATION. THAT THE PATIENT SHOULD BE GIVEN AND IT VERIFY IT MAKES A VERIFIABLE THAT THE RESIDENTS WERE GIVEN THIS INFORMATION. AND- AND HAD A I HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE GONNA TAKE THIS. THIS DRUG SO OF VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MATT BURDEN ON THE- TELEPHONE OPERATOR IS NOT BOARD WITH US. I'M I'M ON AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY- MY NAME IS NOT FOUR NINE AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AND I OF THE LAW FIRM WITH OFFICES IN SAN FRANCISCO AND NEW YORK. THE REASON THAT I'M HERE THAT I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS OF MISUSE THE NURSING HOME. THERE IS NOT INTENDED TO SUBSTITUTE THESE DRUGS FOR STAFF THE IDEA IS THAT YOU MAKE THE POPULATIONONE DOC FILE. YOU DON'T NEED THAT MANY PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM YOU MAKE MORE MONEY AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU SHOT THE COST OF THE PRODUCT ON BECAUSE THE TAXPAYERS BECAUSE THE BALL PAID. FOR BY MEDICARE- THE DRUGS HAVE A DOES. EFFECT YOU BASICALLY. TAKE UPON. THAT DIFFICULTY ARE. IT NEEDS OF THE FIRST PLACE. CAN YOU MAKE IT EVEN HARDER FOR THEM AND YOU EE PEOPLE DYING OF DEHYDRATION. AND YOU ALSO SEE PEOPLE DYING OF A BROKEN HEART THESE DRUGS. REALLY TAP YOUR WILL TO LIVE AND SO THAT BLACK BOX WARNING WORDS THE THAT IT DOUBLES YOUR MORTALITY RATE. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT KOPPEL REASONS THAT GO INTO IT AND EVEN IF IT DOESN'T KILL YOU KNOW I THESE DRUGS HAVE A DETRIMENTAL AFFECT. YEAH I TELL YOU HOW MANY. I'VE TALKED TO FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE EDUCATED. WHO ARE CARRYING AND WELL MEANING PEOPLE WHO THINK OF THESEDRUGS AT THE Q. AND I THINK THAT THESE DRUGS ARE GOING TO MAKE THEIR LOVED ONES. THAT ARE. I THINK THAT THEY'RE TREATING THE DEMENTIA OR HELPING THEM ORGANIZE THEIR THOUGHTS. TWENTY ONE JUST THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. THESE DRUGS ARE THE SAME DRUGS THAT ARE USED IN- MENTAL INSTITUTION BECAUSE OF THE MOST VIOLENT AND DERANGED OF BANKERS AND STATE- AND THEY CRUSH THE HUMAN SPIRIT. AND I THINK THE- OR ONE KEY TO. THE STATE MOST VULNERABLE PART AND FOR. PEOPLE NEED TO UNDER WHY THEY'RE GETTING THEY NEED TO KNOW THE DRUGS ARE NOT A TREATMENT FOR DEMENTIA THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE BLACK BOX WARNING. THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF DOWNSIDE COULD BE DRUGS AND THERE'S A VERY LITTLE UPSIDE AND AN INFORMED CONSENT IS THE KEY AND NOT HOW WOULD YOU KNOW COULD BEGIN STOPPING AND IF YOU COULD PICK UP THINK THAT. THE NURSING HOME AND TO PROTECT. OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS. I THANK YOU. SO IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR A BI EIGHTEEN OH NINE. RIGHT AND I THINK- ONE OF THINGS I NEGLECTED TO DO WAS TALK ABOUT. WITNESSES HERE BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING. BACK TO WITNESSES HERE IN PERSON BUT ALSO WITNESSES ARE AVAILABLE ON THE TELEPHONE- JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY WHO IS WATCHING HAS THE NUMBER THE NUMBER SHOULD BE UP ON THE SCREEN. IT IS 877-692-8957 AND THE ACCESS CODE. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR. THREE SEVEN RIGHT TO OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR A BI EIGHTEEN OH NINE. CERTAINLY AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF SO I'LL ASK YOU TO PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME AGAIN IT'S. ONE ZERO. GIVE US JUST A MOMENT HERE AYE AYE AND ANY OTHERS PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO FOR SUPPORT. AND IN A MOMENT HERE WE CAN OPEN. ONLINE TWENTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN OH NINE THANK YOU. AND AT THIS TIME NINE FURTHER. I'M SORRY SAY THAT AGAIN THAT THERE ARE NO FURTHER. THERE AREN'T THERE AREN'T ANY OTHERS AT THIS GREAT THANK YOU. OKAY WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB EIGHTEEN OH NINE. PLEASE OKAY YEAH. JENNIFER SNYDER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH FACILITIES AND THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE STILL WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION- ALTHOUGH I VERY MUCH WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY GOOD DISCUSSIONS- AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS- SITUATION WHERE WE CAN'T COMPROMISE ON THIS BILL AND I THINK- ARE CONCERNED- BOTH ASSOCIATIONS CONCERNS I THINK CHRIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A BALANCE BETWEEN- WHAT THE- AUTHOR AND SPONSOR. NEED AND WANT WITH RESPECT TO MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A STRONGER INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS IN PLACE WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT- I THINK WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROCESS IS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE- DON'T DETER OUR PRESCRIBERS ARE PHYSICIANS THAT WORK WITH OUR PATIENTS- DON'T TO TURN THEM FROM WANTING TO USE THAT PROCESS AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR PATIENTS ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO PSYCHOTROPIC ANTI PSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS NGUYEN ON HOPEFULLY MANY RARE OCCASIONS THAT THEY NEED THEM AND SO- THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING- REALLY REVOLVE AROUND KIND OF THREE DIFFERENT POINTS. ONE MAKING SURE THAT THE INFORMED CONSENT OF PRIDE OF BRITAIN INFORMED CONSENT IS OF IS A FORM SOMETHING THAT BOTH THE FACILITY AND THAT AND THE PRESCRIBER CAN BE COMPLIANT WITH THAT WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE AND THERE'S NOT A GREAT AREA WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THAT IS I'M BECAUSE IF YOU COUPLE THAT WITH BOTH I'M WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT PUTS IN PLACE. MORE CIVIL LIABILITIES AND CITATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH- OUR PRESCRIBERS AND OUR FACILITIES CAN BE CLEARLY COMPLIANT- IF THEY WANT TO BE- AND SO LAST I WOULD JUST SAY THAT AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REALLY GOOD INITIATIVES AND AT BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE AND THERE WAS A- A FAIR AMOUNT OF A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THAT WE REDUCED AS THE USE OF ANTI PSYCHOTICS IN NURSING FACILITIES AND SINCE THAT TIME THERE HAS BEEN A 50% REDUCTION IN THE USE OF AN ASSET HI. ANDERSON HOME- WE DON'T DENY THAT WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A DOWNTURN IN THAT- AND WE OF LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO. ADDRESS THE SITUATION- BUT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS ABOUT ANOTHER COLLABORATIVE APPROACH RELATED TO EDUCATION AND TRAINING- AND KIND OF COMING OUT THIS IN BOTH. NOT JUST A PUNITIVE APPROACH BUT ALSO IN A VERY POSITIVE APPROACH- AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MORE THOSEDISCUSSIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB EIGHTEEN OH NINE. ALL RIGHT SIGNAL OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANY OPPOSITION TO AB EIGHTEEN OH NINE. THANK YOU AND IF YOU DO OPPOSE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME AGAIN IT'S. ONE ZERO. GIVING A MOMENTARY YOU HAVE NOBODY IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU ARE PRETTY MAY CLOSE THE LINES THEN AND I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I WAS AGUIAR-CURRY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND I THINK WE'VE- WE'VE SEEN TOO OFTEN OVER THE YEARS. WITH VULNERABLE. INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY ARE ARE OLDER ADULTS AND OUR KIDS THAT. RESTRAINTS BE THEY PHYSICAL OR CHEMICAL ARE OFTEN USED WHEN THE- REALLY FOR THAT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE FACILITY THAT IT'S AN EASY WAY TO SUBDUE SOMEONE WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK AT UNDERLYING ISSUES SO I TAKE THE POINT FROM THERE THE OPERATORS THAT THEY WANT TO BE CLEAR AND I HOPE THAT THAT THAT SOMETHING CAN BE WORKED OUT SO THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR. WHEN IT'S BEING USED OR NOT BEING USED BUT I THINK WE DEFINITELY NEED TO GET AWAY FROM. THIS NOTION OF% INSTITUTIONS WHICH IS SORT OF NATURAL FOR THEM TO DO TO WANT TO PROTECT THE INSTITUTION TO LOOK MORE BROADLY AT HAVE THE ISSUES FUNCTIONS. AS OPPOSED TO LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR CARE AND THAT SEEMS TO PLEASE IN THE WORK THAT I'VE DONE IN THE JUVENILE SPACE SPECIALLY. THAT'S WHAT'S LED TO OVER PRESCRIPTIONS OVER UTILIZATION OF. OF RESTRAINTS TODAY GREETED IT IS HIGH TIME THAT WE RAISE THAT AWARENESS. AND IF THERE ARE COLLABORATIVE WAYS TO DO IT BETTER OKAY FINE BITES THAT'S NOT HOW A LOT OF PLACES RESPOND IN A LOT OF INSTITUTIONS ARE. ON THE UP AND UP AND OTHERS ARE JUST. IN THE BUSINESS OF TRYING TO KEEP THINGS AS CALM AS POSSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND THAT'S NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THOSE IN THEIR CARE. SO I APPRECIATE THIS BILL. OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE. ALL RIGHT- THIS AGUIAR-CURRY MAY CLOSE YEAH I JUST WANT TO COMMENT IS THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION WE'VE I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE ANY PROBLEM GETTING TO A GOOD LANDING PLACE BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THEY DO MEAN A LOT TO ME THEY MEAN A LOT TO THE PEOPLE AND I CONSTITUENTS TO BE REPRESENTED A SO AGAIN I JUST SIMPLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU IN IN. WE WILL DO SO WHAT WAS WE GET A QUORUM WILL BE ABLE AS A CHRISTIAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHERMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK YOU. RIGHT LET'S MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWO AB TWENTY THREE THIRTEEN IST BLOW. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SIGNED. PLEASE TO PRESENT THIS MORNING AB TWENTY THREE THIRTEEN WHICH REQUIRES THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO ESTABLISH A WATER LAW TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR JUDGES AND WILL ALSO ALLOW THE CHIEF JUSTICE TO ASSIGN COMPLEX WATER CASES TO TRAIN JUDGES. IT ALSO WOULD PROVIDE JUDGES WITH EXPERT RESOURCES DEVELOPED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO ASSESS TRIAL JUDGES IN THE JUDICATA IN THESE COMPLEX CASES. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND OF COURSE THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR EXCELLENT WORK ON THE BILL. AS CALIFORNIA SUFFERS YET ANOTHER RECORD BREAKING DROUGHT CONFLICTS OVER WATER NATURALLY ARE ON THE INCREASE. THE LITIGATION RESULTING FROM THESE CONFLICTS AS FREQUENTLY OF A COMPLEX NATURE REQUIRING EXPERTISE AND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO RESOLVE. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS LONG DEFINED WATER ADJUDICATION AS PRESUMABLY COMPLEX REQUIRING MORE JUDICIAL ATTENTION AND RESOURCES. THE CHIEF JUSTICE MAY ASSIGN SUCH COMPLEX CASES TO THE JUDGES WHO SERVE AND COMPLEX COURT PROGRAMS IN URBAN COUNTIES. BUT IN SOME CASES TRIAL JUDGES HAVE HIRED EXPERIENCED WATER LAWYERS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEX NATURE OF WATER LAW AND WORK THROUGH OFTEN VOLUMINOUS ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS SOMETIMES NUMBERING IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PAGES. THESE MAY ALSO AGREED TO PAY A SPECIAL MASTER TO INVESTIGATE TECHNICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES FOR THE JUDGE. HOWEVER THOSE OCCASIONAL EFFORTS DEPENDED ON A JUDGE FINDING AN EXPERIENCE WATER EXPERT WHO DIDN'T HAVE CONFLICTS. AND THEIR COURT ALSO FINDING THE MONEY TO HIRE THOSE INDIVIDUALS. URBAN AND RURAL TRIAL JUDGES WITH COMPLEX WATER CASES WHO USUALLY HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN WATER LAW NEED GREATER STATEWIDE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO RESOLVE WATER CONFLICTS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. WATER CONFLICTS OFTEN AFFECT MORE THAN JUST THE TWO PARTIES IN LITIGATION THESE CONFLICTS CAN IMPACT AN ENTIRE COMMUNITIES WATER OR CRITICAL STATE WIDE NATURAL SOURCES LIKE THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA. AND MAY EVEN RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. AB TWENTY THREE THIRTEEN OFFERS A DYNAMIC APPROACH TO DELIVER THE CRITICALLY NEEDED TRAINING AND RESOUCES TO ASSIST JUDGES ACROSS THE STATE AND RESOLVING THESE CONFLICTS EFFECTIVELY. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD CREATE A WATER LAW EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR JUDGES AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND SEEK TO INCLUDE IN THE PROGRAM JUDGES REPRESENTING COUNTIES WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF EACH OF THE NINE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARDS IN EACH APPELLATE. DISTRICT IT WILL ALLOW THE CHIEF JUSTICE TO ASSIGN CASES RELATING TO WATER. TO A JUDGE WITH WATER LAW TRAINING OR EDUCATION AND REQUIRE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO IDENTIFY EXPERTS IN WATER SCIENCE OR WATER MANAGEMENT OR RESEARCH ATTORNEYS WHO WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANY JUDGE ACUITY EDUCATING A WATER DISPUTE. IT WILL AUTHORIZE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO PAY OR REIMBURSE COURTS FOR THE COSTS OF EMPLOYING OR CONTRACTING WITH EXPERTS IT IN WATER SCIENCE OUR WATER MANAGEMENT OR RESEARCH OR RESEARCH ATTORNEYS IN AN ACTION RELATED TO WATER WITH FUNDS APPROPRIATED FOR THAT PURPOSE. AND FINALLY IT WILL EXPAND CURRENT LAW ALLOWING A JUDGE TO APPOINT A QUALIFIED SPECIAL MASTER TO APPLY TO A WIDER RANGE OF WATER CASES. I AM PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY RYAN BIZARRO A SHAREHOLDER IN THE LAW FIRM MARKOWITZ CHRONIC AND SHANAHAN HERE IN SACRAMENTO. MR BIZARRE HAS PRACTICED WATER LAW IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE FOR OVER TWENTY YEAR AND WILL BE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER BLUE SERVE FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING- AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM- INDICATED BY NAMES RAIMES ZERO I'M A SHAREHOLDER BERKOWITZ CHRONIC AND SHANAHAN R. WE HAVE CLIENTS WHO ARE WATER USERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. PRIMARILY PUBLIC AGENCIES WE REPRESENT ABOUT 75% OF OUR CLIENTS REPUBLIC AGENCIES IN VARIOUS AREAS SO. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE WATER RIGHTS ATTORNEY FOR THE- CITIES OF SANTA CRUZ- FOLSOM AND- ROSEVILLE AND HAVE. DISSIPATED IN AND LITIGATED A NUMBER OF THESE- VERY LARGE MATTERS AND SO WHAT YOU SEE- RELATIVE TO THE NORMAL RUN OF SUPERIOR COURT CASES IS THERE'S ABOUT THREE REAL CROSSCUTTING TENSIONS AND WATER CASES. THAT OFTEN MAKE THEM VERY DIFFICULT FOR- THE SPIRIT COURT JUDGE TO HANDLE ON THE NORMAL DOCKET. THEY ARE TEND TO HAVE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES I'M RANGING FROM. SIX OR SEVEN IN A RELATIVELY SIMPLE CASE TO HUNDREDS OR OF OR THOUSANDS. IN A THE ADJUDICATION OF A GROUNDWATER BASINS SUCH AS- THE ONES I'VE PARTICIPATED IN- IN THE SANTA MARIA AREA ON THE CENTRAL COAST IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY IN EASTERN. A LOS ANGELES AREA AND THEN- THE SALINAS- BASS AND ALSO N THE CENTRAL COAST YOU SEE HUNDREDS OF PARTIES AND IT'S- OBVIOUSLY VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THAT WITHIN A NORMAL. COURT CASE- THE ISSUES WATER CASES PRESENT TEND TO BE VERY TECHNICAL. SO YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PARTIES AND THEN YOU LAY ON TOP OF THAT- REALLY COMPETING EXPERTS DEBATING ALL SORTS OF- TECHNICAL THINGS SUCH AS HOW MUCH WATER PERCOLATES INTO A GROUNDWATER BASIN ON AVERAGE. AND HOW MUCH- EXTRACTION OCCURS IT'S NOT SIMPLE TO CALCULATE THOSE THINGS SO THE JUDGE HAS TO MANAGE LARGE NUMBERS OF EXPERTS AS WELL IN MANY OF THESE CASES. AND THEN AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM INDICATED. MANY OF THESE CASES ARE VERY DOCUMENT HEAVY IF YOU CAN IMAGINE- LITIGATION INVOLVING HUNDREDS OF LANDOWNERS HAVING TO PROVE UP- HOW MUCH GROUND WATER THEY MAY HAVE PUMPED OVER TIME. VERY DOCUMENT HEAVY- AS THE BAY DELTA LITIGATION AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM INDICATED THAT DIDN'T INVOLVE WITNESSES BUT IT HAD TO INVOLVE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD PROCEEDING. THAT HAD LASTED FOR YEARS AND SO YOU HAD TENS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD ALL OF THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE TO HANDLE ON A NORMAL DOCKET SO. THE CONCEPT OF THE STATE HAVING A PROGRAM TO UNDER WHICH JUDGES CAN BE TRAINED AS TO WHAT ISSUES ARISE AND HOW TO HANDLE THEM IN THE KINDS OF CASES IS A VERY GOOD IDEA. THEN THOSE JUDGES THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAVING THE ABILITY TO ASSIGN CASES TO JUDGES WHO HAVE THAT TRAINING- SHOULD. OF THOSE JUDGES PROCESS THESE CASES AS THEY MOVE FORWARD- AND THEN FINALLY THE STATE PROVIDING SOME SUPPORT. FOR EXPERT ASSISTANCE IN THESE CASES ALSO MAKES VERY GOOD SENSE AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM INDICATED MANY OF THEM ALL OFTEN INVOLVES WHOLE REGIONS. WATER SUPPLIES AND SO THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT THESE CASES PROCEED- BOTH EFFICIENTLY AND WELL SO THE BILL MAKES A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE LAW THAT I THINK- WOULD. HELP THE STATE AS A WHOLE. THANK YOU. OR IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF TWENTY THREE THIRTEEN. ALL RIGHT SIGNAL OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONEWHO WOULD LIKE TO. SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE THIRTEEN.

GRIEVANCE FROM CALAIS CHART EVER. A DIRECT I'M GOING BACK INTO THE EIGHTIES ON THIS AND- THE ISSUE IS THAT- THEY DENY EVERYTHING AND THEN THE SEND OF SOFT INTO SUPERIOR COURT TO TRY TO FIX THINGS WHICH TAKES A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND YEARS OF TIME FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE ONE CASE THAT IS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD WERE WINNING THE CASE WE WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CAME BACK DOWN AND NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO DECIPHER HOW MUCH THEY OWE AS- IF THEY WERE JUST TO PAY EACH SUPERVISOR.

THEY'LL MAKE MONEY OFF THESE CASES. BUT WE CAN RESOLVE THESE THINGS IN FORTY FIVE DAYS. NOT THIRTEEN YEARS OR FIVE YEARS OR WHATEVER A LOT OF THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE OF GROWN OLD AND DIED. OF TRYING TO GET A RESOLUTION ON THESE ISSUES OF YOU HAVE TWENTY ONE BARGAINING UNITS THAT HAVE ARBITRATION RIGHTS. YOU DON'T SEE ANY THESE- RANK AND FILE ORGANIZATIONS VIOLIN IN SUPERIOR COURT COSTING THE STATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LITIGATION. THE ONLY PEOPLE YOU SEE IN SUPERIOR COURT OR THE SUPERVISORS WHY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME THING THAT THE- RANK AND FILE HAVE WHICH IS ARBITRATION RIGHTS. AND THE ISSUE OF- CAL HR- HAS MISINFORMED THE GOVERNOR REPEATEDLY I THINK THE LAST VETO MESSAGE SAID WE CAN GO TO OF STATE PERSONNEL BOARD OR- FARE- EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. FOR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING IS THE ECO ISSUE. STATE PERSONNEL BOARD IS FOR MERIT ISSUES IN DISCIPLINARY ISSUES. THE ARBITRATION THE BILL IS FOR WORKING CONDITIONS AND PAY YES WE'VE WE CAN'T GO TO EITHER ONE OF THOSE DEALS EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE WHAT IT BECAUSE HE WAS MISINFORMED BY CAL HR WHO DOES NOT WANT US TO HAVE. ARBITRATION RIGHTS BECAUSE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS DENY OUR GRIEVANCES INCENTIVES OFF TO SUPERIOR COURT GOOD FOR US TO SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN YEARS OF LITIGATION ON SOMETHING THAT COULD BE RESOLVED IN FORTY FIVE DAYS FOR FORTY THOUSAND. AND WE ALSO THANK YOU TAYLOR THIS OUR ENERGY TO WRAP UP PLEASE BILL.

A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY SO. AS- AS SOMEONE HAS GOTTEN HAD MANY VETS BILLS VETOED BEFORE I CAN ALWAYS UNDERSTAND- WHAT THE REASONING IS I JUST HOPE THAT WHATEVER ISSUE THERE IS WITH THE MINISTRATIONS RESOLVED BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY LOGICAL.

THANK YOU AND WE WILL TAKE IT UP ONCE WE GET A QUORUM. THANK YOU NUMBER FIVE AB TWENTY ONE NINETY THREE MR GABRIEL. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M PLEASED 2% AB TWENTY ONE NINETY THREE WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN THE SARGENT SHRIVER CIVIL COUNCIL ACT. THE SHRIVER PROGRAM PROVIDES LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS IN HIGH STAKES CIVIL MATTERS IMPACTING BASIC HUMAN NEEDS SUCH AS CHILD CUSTODY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND EVICTION PROCEEDINGS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW AB THREE THIRTY BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE TRIBE OR PROGRAM SOTHAT MORE CALIFORNIANS CAN BE A SHORT OF MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO JUSTICE THROUGH THE LEGAL SYSTEM. THIS BILL BUILDS ON THAT PROGRESS BY HELPING TO ENSURE THAT AL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED UNDER THE TRIBAL PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY MANY LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO PROVIDE REPRESENTATION TO UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE OF CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO FEDERAL FUNDING. THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP THAT INJUSTICE BY REQUIRING THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO REFER IMMIGRANTS FOR SERVICES ELSEWHERE IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THEM ON THEIR OWN. THIS IS A REQUIREMENT THAT IS BOTH MORAL AND DEEPLY PRACTICAL ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN OUR UNDOCUMENTED NEIGHBORS WHO ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING DENIED-RELIEF PROVIDED TO OTHER FOLKS AND THEREFORE MORE LIKELY TO BE A NIGHT OF EXACTLY THE TYPE OF SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THE SHRIVER PROGRAM. AND I WOULD YOU SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL- ONE OF THE FIRST PRO BONO MATTERS THAT I HANDLE THIS YOUNG ATTORNEY I THINK ACTUALLY MAY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST. IS REPRESENTING THE VICTIMS OF. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO WAS UNDOCUMENTED. AND HER ABUSER WAS A CITIZEN. AND IT WAS VERY EYE OPENING TO SEE THE VULNERABILITY THAT SHE EXPERIENCE THE WAY THAT HER ABUSER SOUGHT TO LEVERAGE- THE DISPARITY IN THEIR STATUS AGAINST HER TO TRY TO DISCOURAGE HER FROM SEEKING RELIEF THROUGH THE COURTS- AND IT WOULD JUST. REALLY IMPRESSED UPON ME HOW- AS WE THINK ABOUT IT. CALIFORNIANS WERE EXPLOITED WHO LACK POWER- ARE ARE UNDOCUMENTED. FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ARE AT THE VERY TOP OF THAT LIST- BECAUSE THEY OFTEN LACK POWER FOR MULTIPLE REASONS AND SO- YOU KNOW WE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE FOLKS IN WASHINGTON WHO. MADE A POLICY DECISION TO TRY TO DENY LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO THE MOST WONDERFUL CALIFORNIANS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA. HAVE TO REINFORCE THAT DECISION AND I THINK USING WITH THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE ON SHRIVER- AND HOPEFULLY WITH THIS LEGISLATION WE CAN. DIRECT LEGAL SERVICES TO THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST- SO WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME- AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IS SKIP CANING THE DIRECTOR OF PRO BONO SERVICES AT AND NEIGHBORHOOD LEGAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THANK YOU I BELIEVE MR CANNINGS WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE ARE YOU HERE. M.

ANALYSTS IS THE LEAD AGENCY OFFICIAL EVER HOUSING PROJECT IN THE CENTRAL COURTHOUSE IN LOS ANGELES. AND IN THAT CAPACITY WE'VE SEEN THE BENEFITS OF THE SHRIVER PROJECT TO LOW INCOME RESIDENTS OF LA COUNTY. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER BELIEVE ORGANIZATIONS FUNDED THROUGH THE SARGENT SHRIVER CIVIL COUNCIL ACT ARE LEGALLY TO LIKE AND I'LL ASK THAT RECEIVED FUNDING THROUGH THE FEDERAL LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION. WELL LSC FUNDING IS BEEN CRITICAL IN HELPING ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY LEGAL SERVICES TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY. IT DOES COME WITH RESTRICTIONS THAT PREVENT US FROM PROVIDING LEGAL AID IN SOME CASES TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS PROVIDE LEGAL AID TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN CERTAIN CASES WHICH IS BLENDED FAMILIES ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THEIR CLIENTS WE HAVE TO REFER TO ONE OF OUR NON LSC FUNDED PARTNERS. IN THOSE CASES THE WHOLE WARM HAND OFF TO A TRUSTED PARTNER WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE CLIENT RECEIVES THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAMS UNDER THE SHRIVER AFTER REFER CLIENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE SHRIVER PROJECT. TO OUR SISTER LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS. AB TWENTY ONE NINETY THREE WILL PROTECT SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS AND HELP TO CLOSE THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE GAP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

TO REPRESENT THE CHANGING DEFINITION OF FAMILY IN OUR STATE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT ADS- CLARITY. IN CURRENT LAW TWO SECTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY CONFUSING FOR THOSE GOING THROUGH THE END OF LIFE CARE FOR EXAMPLE. THERE IS A SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLD WOMAN LIVING ALONE.

TAKE HER TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM HER NURSE AND HER CARE TEAM HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE IS NO ADVANCE DIRECTIVE. AT THIS TIME IT IS UP TO THE DOCTORS OR HER A CARE TEAM TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION FOR HER. ONLY ONE IN EVERY THREE ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES COMPLETES ANY TYPE OF ADVANCE DIRECTIVE FOR THE END OF LIFE HEALTH CARE CURRENTLY LOS CURRENT LAW. CAN DO A BETTER JOB IN MAKING SURE THAT PERSONS WITH PATIENTS BEST INTERESTS AT HEART MAKE CRITICAL HEALTH DECISIONS. THE NEXT OF KIN IS NOT ALWAYS THE NEXT OF KIN. IN SOME CASES IT'S A FRIEND A CARE GIVER DOMESTIC PARTNER WHO MAKES UP OUR FAMILY. ONE THING THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN WHILE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH PATIENT ORIENTED CARE IS THAT NOT ALL FAMILY MEMBERS COME IN ONE SIZE OR FLAVOR. ARE MEMBERS OF THE AGING COMMUNITY EXPRESSLY THOSE IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE OFTEN FORCED TO BE ALONE DURING THE LACK OF SUPPORT THIS POPULATION HAS ALSO BEEN ONE OF THE MOST ISOLATED DURING THE PANDEMIC THE VERY PERSONAL AND SENSITIVE SITUATION THAT WE GO THROUGH DURING TIMES OF ILLNESS.

THANK YOU. STATE WHY WE CONTINUE TO SEE A PROBLEM WITH ILLEGAL CANNABIS MARKET NOT ONLY DO THESE OPERATORS UNDERCUT THE LEGAL MARKET BUT THEIR OPERATION WHETHER CULTIVATION MANUFACTURING OR RETAIL POSE A GREAT THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AND LOS ANGELES ALONE APPROXIMATELY 90% OF CANADA'S OPERATORS EXIST IN THE LEGAL MARKET. THIS BILL PROVIDES ANOTHER TOOL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SHUT DOWN THESE BUSINESSES BY ASSESSING PIES OF PROPERTY OWNERS WHO KNOWINGLY PERMIT. THESE BUSINESSES TO OPERATE AB TWENTY ONE OH TWO ASSESS IS A CIVIL PENALTY OF UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY FOR PROPERTY OWNERS IN VIOLATION. THE BILL SPECIFIED THAT THESE FINES CAN BE LEVIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CANVAS CONTROL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS I RESPECTFULLY AFTER I VOTE TO CONTINUE EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE ILLEGAL CANNABIS MARKET.

AGAIN I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY FIVE A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE THAT CANNABIS IS TREATED JUST LIKE ANY OTHER LEGAL SUBSTANCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF CHILD CUSTODY DEPENDENCY COURT. AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. AND I ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU OUR OFFICES HAD BEEN AWARE OF INCIDENTS WHERE FAMILIES ARE BROUGHT INTO DEPENDENCY COURTS FOR THE MERE POSSESSION OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE OF CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT. AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS MERE POSSESSION OF LEGAL CANNABIS IS INSUFFICIENT TO TAKE CUSTODY OF A FAMILY UNDER CASE LAW YET STILL WE ARE AWARE OF SITUATIONS WHERE FAMILIES ARE DRAGGED INTO COURT MERELY DUE TO POSSESSION OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT AND I REPEAT DOES NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE CHILD WELFARE INVESTIGATION PROCESS OR ANY PROCEEDINGS. IT ONLY REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OVERSEES INVESTIGATION TO ENSURE THAT ALL REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE GIVEN TO COUNTIES TREATS CANNABIS TO SAME AS ALCOHOL OR LEGALLY PRESCRIBED MEDICATION. DR FAMILIES INTO COURT FOR POSSESSION OF CANNABIS CANNABIS IS NOT ONLY A STRESSFUL EVENT THAT REQUIRES TAKING TIME OFF OF WORK FOR JUGGLING SCHEDULES IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY TRAUMATIC FOR CHILDREN. THIS BILL WILL MAKE SURE THAT INVESTIGATORS STILL HAVE THE TOOLS TO DETERMINE A COLLECT. OR B.

AS A MEMBER NOTED IN TWENTY TWELVE THE COURT OF APPEAL HAS CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT A PARENT CANNABIS ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT. FOR THE STATE TO INTERFERE IN THE FAMILY DESPITE OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS IN THE CHILDREN'S COURT I THINK HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES HOLD THROUGH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. SOLELY BECAUSE THE PARENT IS CANADA AT SOME POINT. AND MANY OF THESE CASES THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THE CHILD EVERYTHING. AGREED ON THE BLACKBOARD. IN FACT CLOUT IT'S HEALTHY LAW. GOING TO.

VOICE GO AHEAD SIR. MORNING FOR MEMBERS MY NAME IS KEN LANGONE ON THE POLICY ASSOCIATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN LAWYERS ASSOCIATION YOU'RE ONE OF THE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF AB NINETEEN FORTY NINE ALONG WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES LEGAL AID AT WORK AND CRIME SURVIVORS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. GOOD LUCK TO ONCE AGAIN EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE FOR A FAMILY MEMBER LOW FIGURE FOR THE SENSE AND PUSHING FOR THE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS IN THIS BILL AND ALSO FOR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE EXCELLENT OFFICE. THE TESTIMONY THAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM A SECOND WITNESS MISS YVONNE PRICE. IS A DEVASTATING ACCOUNT FOR THE HARDSHIP THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS HAVE HAD TO ENDURE WHEN THE LAPTOP PROTECTED TIME TO GRIEVE PROTECTIONS EXPOSES THE GLARING GAP AND I LEAVE LAWS THAT END UP COMPOUNDING THE HARDSHIPS FOR WORKERS IN AN ALREADY DIFFICULT TIME. EXISTING LAW PROVIDES DROP PROTECTION FOR WORKERS TO TAKE CARE OF A SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY MEMBER. BUT BOTH PROTECTION AND THE MINUTE THE FAMILY MEMBER PASSES AWAY. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW WORKERS TO TAKE. UP TO FIVE DAYS OF UNPAID BEREAVEMENT LEAVE. A MODEST AMOUNT OF TIME TO ALLOW THEM TO GRIEVE AND ARRANGE THE FINAL AFFAIRS. MANY EMPLOYERS THAT ALREADY PROVIDE FREQUENTLY BENEFITS ARE TO BE COMMENDED FOR RECOGNIZING THE HUMANITY OF THEIR WORKERS AND ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC MOMENT OF THEIR LIVES. ARE THAT ADDS ADDITIONAL STRESS THE FINANCIAL AND SECURITY. BUT WORKERS ACCESS TO SUCH BENEFITS ARE LEFT TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEIR EMPLOYER WHEN TRAGEDY STRIKES. AND WITHOUT A RIGHT GUARANTEED BY LAW THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE BENEFIT FURTHER TRAUMATIZE THEM OUT OF ALL NORMAL TIME. THIS BILL IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF LOSS IN THE STATE AS A RESULT OF A COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO HOW TO COPE WITH OF NINETEEN BECOMING ENDEMIC. AND WITH CLOSE TO NINETY THOUSAND LIVES HAVING ALREADY BEEN LOST IN THE STATE. RESPECTFULLY URGE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE SO THE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA AFFORDED THE TIME DEGREETHANK YOU.
