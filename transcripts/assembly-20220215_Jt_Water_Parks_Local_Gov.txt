I WANT TO WELCOME OUR WITNESSES TO THE HEARING AND THANK THEM FOR COMING TO DISCUSS SIGMAR THIS SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT IN THIS PROCEEDING. TODAY AS WE ALL KNOW WE'RE FACING YOU'RE REALLY SIMILAR CONDITIONS TO THAT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN SIGNAL WAS PASSED. WE'RE EXPERIENCING A THIRD CONSECUTIVE DRY YEAR AFTER OUR SECOND DRIEST YEAR ON RECORD JUST LAST YEAR. WE CAME OUT OF OUR LAST ROUND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH IS CALIFORNIA'S MOST OF YOUR ON RECORD AND WE THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN SO SOON. WE HAD A BEAUTIFUL SNOWY AND RAINY FALL AND THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD YEAR AND HERE WE ARE WITH LITTLE TO NO RAIN. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE NUMBER THAT WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH WE MANAGE OUR WATER AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN A GOOD POSITION DESPITE OUR ONGOING DROUGHTS. WE HAVE TO GET SIGNAL RIGHT. AND WE NEED TO EXPEDITIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED SO THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE WATER FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AGRICULTURE AND THE ENVIRONMENT BOTH NOW BUT ALSO IN THE DECADES TO COME. THE pMILESTONE IN SIGMA AND IMPLEMENTATION IS NOW A REALITY IN OVER NINETY GROUNDWATER BASINS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TO HEAR FROM ADMINISTRATION AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO SEE HOW THE IMPORTANT UNDERTAKE THIS IMPORTANT WORK IS GOING AND TO MAKE SURE ALL WORKING TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF GROUNDWATER. I'M HONORED TO HAVE THE AUTHORS OF THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION JOINING US IN OPENING THE COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY TO OFFER THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN PERSPECTIVE ON WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE US GO. WITH THAT I WANT TO HEAD OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AND CHAIR OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANK YOU UP FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU. TO MY COACH I AM IS BOUND HAND IN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND ALL OF OUR PANELISTS WILL TAKE THE TIME OUT OF THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES TO ATTEND AND SPEAK ABOUT THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND I'VE ALSO THANK YOU- MISQUOTING- KILEY FIFTY NORTH FOR JOINING US AS WELL. THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT WAS ESTABLISHED DURING ONE OF THE WORST DROUGHT ON RECORD TO HELP CORRECT THE MISUSE OF OUR- MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCES. THIS HEARING IS PARTICULARLY TIMELY AS WE CURRENTLY FACE ANOTHER DROUGHT. WHICH WAY B. OUR NEW NORMAL. BECAUSE OF THIS NEW NORMAL IT REMAINS JUST AS IMPORTANT TODAY TO CONTINUE THE WORK STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND. FOURTEEN WITH SIGMA. UNFORTUNATELY WELLS CONTINUE TO GO DRY ALARMING RATES LEAVING MANY CALIFORNIANS RESIDENTS WITHOUT A RELIABLE. SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER. NOT JUST WONDERFUL WILL FIX THIS THE ISSUE WE HAVE A HELD. AS PERCENT INTO THE FUTURE OUR GROUNDWATER IMPORTANT. MANY OF THE CURRENT MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT SERVING THE LEGISLATURE WHEN CYGNET WAS ESTABLISHED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS TO EXPLORE SIGMA AND EDUCATE OURSELVES ON THE ISSUE WHICH ONE FOR OUR FUTURE LEGISLATIVE CONVERSATIONS. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE HEARING TODAY I HOPE IT'S A LIVELY DISCUSSION FROM OUR PANELISTS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR SPEAKERS WHO WILL BE PRETTY PARTICIPATING IN THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TODAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETER NOTICES LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS. THANK YOU MADAM AND THINK YOU ALSO CHAIR OF OUR CAN. AT THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S HEARING REALLY COULD NOT BE MORE URGENT I'M JUST YESTERDAY AS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN. A NEW STUDY PUBLISHED IN NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE JOURNAL CONCLUDED THAT THE CURRENT WESTERN MEGA DROUGHT IS THE WORST IN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED YEARS. THE WORST IN TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS. I'M HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THIS QUITE LITERALLY ON THE GROUND WITH AS BAD IT'S- CHAIR AGUIAR-CURRY NOTED. CALIFORNIA GROUND BASINS IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED TODAY. WE CANNOT BURY OUR HEADS IN THE SAND AND JUST HOPE FOR A MIRACLE OR HOPE FOR THAT NEXT BIG STORM WE NEED TO PLAN FOR LESS WATER PURE AND SIMPLE WE NEED TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S WATER CONSERVATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT. AND MORE BROADLY AS THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZES THE URGENCY OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE HAVE MADE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS TO BUILD CLIMATE RESILIENCE TO SHORE UP WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALSO TEACH YOU ABOUT COMMUNITIES PREPARE FOR SEA LEVEL RISE AND TO HELP BETTER PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO WILDFIRE THREATS. AS WE ROLL OUT THESE INVESTMENTS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE BUILD IN ROUTE BEST OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENSURE THAT THESE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS YIELD EQUALLY HISTORIC RESULTS FOR CALIFORNIA SO I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF OUR TEARS TODAY FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. AND FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AS WE MOVE A GREAT STEP FORWARD AT THANK YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO A AT REALLY THOUGHTFUL AND DEBT AND INFORMATIVE CONVERSATION TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I APPRECIATE WILL HAVE OTHER COMMENTS FROM OUR MEMBERS LATER DURING. THE CONVERSATION AT AS WE GOT THIS AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM TODAY. I FIRST LIKE TO START- WITH THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT SIGNAL ONE OH ONE. AND WE'RE HONORED TODAY TO HAVE SENATOR FRAN PAVLEY JOINED US TODAY WHO IS ONE OF THE INSTIGATORS BEHIND CIGNA AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROGER DIXON SINCE SO WE WILL START WITH. SENATOR PAVLEY. THREE OF SENATOR PABLO THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEM YES WE DO HELLO WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. IN. THE NEW FULL SCREEN MODE. OKAY CAN YOU SEE THE PRESCRIPTION WE SURE CAN WELCOME SENATOR. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING TO EVERYONE I WISH I COULD BE THERE IN PERSON BUT- I DECIDED TO INVADE MY FORMER STATE SENATE OFFICE AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HENRY STERN STAP THAT'S WHAT THEY GET FROM HAVING THEIR DISTRICT OFFICE THREE MILES FROM MY HOME. SO- YEAH THAT'S THE WORST THING ABOUT BEING OUT OF OFFICE MAY END. UP WE MIGHT NOT GET PENSIONS AND WE DON'T GET HEALTH CARE BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY STAFF EITHER AND THAT'S WHAT I'M STILL ADJUSTING TO. ANYWAY THIS PICTURE I THOUGHT I JUST START WITH REAL QUICKLY IN THIS IS A ONE ON ONE CLASS AND START FOR MANY OF YOU- YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW THIS INFORMATION BUT WHO KNEW AND FUTURE SAID. THAT WE WOULD BE FACING SORT OF THE SAME KIND OF CONDITIONS WE WERE FACING IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN WHEN WE PASSED THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT AND THAT'S A COPY AT THE BILL SIGNING. WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER DICKINSON AND I JOINED BY A- PRIVATE PREMIER GROWER FISCAL FARMS AND- A MEMBER OF OCT WELL. CITY'S BIG THE DEADLY OWNED CHAIRED OTHER P. AT THE BILL SIGNING SO THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. WHERE WE WERE. IN OUR FIFTH YEAR OF DROUGHT. SO JUST MOVING ON I'VE BEEN ASKED TO JUST GO OVER THE KEY PROVISIONS OF LEGISLATION UNLESS YOU'D LIKE TO READ THE- MULTI PAGE. BILL BUT IN SIMPLE TERMS. THE CONCEPT WAS- CHIPS SUSTAINABLY MANAGE YOUR GROUNDWATER BASIN AND THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO OVER APPEAR IN TWO YEARS. NOT TAKE OUT MORE WATER THAN IS COMING IN AND IT TAKES A LOT LONGER TO HELP GROUND WATER PARTICULARLY WHEN WE FEEL ABOUT HUNGER BASIN- THAN IT DOES TO PUMP IT OUT. IT CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONSTITUTION LOOKING AT WATER IS A PROPERTY RIGHT UNDER STATE LAW. REQUIRES LOCAL AGENCIES TO ADOPT GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN SO WE STARTED WITH THE MOST. MODERATE SEVERE. I'M BASINS THAT WERE BEING OVER TO AND THAT'S ABOUT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE OF FIVE AND FIFTEEN BASINS AROUND THE STATE. IT GAVE TOOLS AND ABILITIES TO THE LOCAL GROUNDWATER BASINS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLANTS ASSISTANCE BY THE STATE WATER BOARD OF STAFF OR FUNDS FOR PARTICULAR STUDIES. THE DJUDICATED BASINS THAT THE TERM FOR THE LEGALLY- JUDICIALLY DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE BODY AND- TOPWATER LAWYERS TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH EACH ENTITY OVER RELYING A GROUNDWATER BASIN HOW MUCH WATER THEY GOT THE PERCENTAGE OF WATER THAT WOULD CHANGE UP AND DOWN AS AS THE WATER LEVELS INDICATE AND FINALLY IT PROVIDED THE STATE TO BE A BACKSTOP OF LOCAL GROUNDWATER AGENCY SCANNER WILL MANAGE THEIR BASE AND THEN I LEARNED THAT THAT ACTUALLY WAS A PRETTY GOOD THREAT- THE STATE WATER BOARD WOULD COME IN AND MANAGE IT FOR YOU IF YOU COULD MANAGE IT SELF. BUT HERE WE ARE A FEW YEARS LATER AND THE SOME OF OUR- SEVERELY DRAFTED WATER AGENCIES. DID NOT SUBMIT PLANS ON TIME. SO THAT THREE DAYS AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE WERE KEY TO THIS EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ONLINE- WE HAD THE RESEARCH DONE BY AQUA WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN PROVIDING BACKGROUND. TO THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN- THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND THE WATER EDUCATION FOUNDATION. THE RESOURCES LEGACY FUND WAS INVOLVED- BUT VERY GOOD UP TO DATE RESEARCH ALL THIS WAS REQUESTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION UNDER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN THE CODE AT THE BOTTOM IS FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE DRISKELL CLOSER YOU LIVE ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST. PROPOSES A BIG- BERRY OPERATION VERY DEPENDENT SPECIALLY ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST WHERE THEY'RE VERY RELIANT ON GROUNDWATER. A TIME FRAME AND YOU CAN LOOK THAT UP LATER WAS SET INTO PLACE SO WE'RE- REALIZING NOW WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. ANOTHER EXTREME APPROVED A DROUGHT YOU MAY NEED TO ACCELERATE THIS TIME TABLE ON THEM I'M SO- RICHARD OF YOU HAVING THIS FORUM TODAY. I PULLED THIS OUT OF MY OLD FILES- BECAUSE I'M STILL LAST TO GIVE PRESENTATIONS ON STICKING AROUND THE STATE. THIS WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND IF YOU JUST GLANCE THROUGH IT JUST THAT FIRST PARAGRAPH ITSELF IT WAS FROM UP OF STORYAND THE SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS. YOU WOULD THINK WE'RE READING A CONTEMPORARY STORY THAT WOULD BE IN THE PAPER TODAY. ABOUT PROVED DRILLING TECHNOLOGIES IN OUR RACE TO THE BOTTOM BUT OVER PUMPING A MORE MOISTURE DEMANDING CROPS WERE DOING YEAR ROUND CROPS THAT REQUIRE WATER- FIELDS CAN'T BE LATE FELLOW AND HISTORICALLY DRY CONDITIONS AND WE'RE LEARNING OUR SOIL THREE EVEN MORE DRY THAN WHAT THEY WERE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THE WATER TABLE COLLAPSES. THE LAND SUBSIDES YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS SPECIALLY TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND HOW IT APPLIES TO WATER INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE CANALS AND AQUEDUCTS. AND IT'S OTHER CAR PERSPECTIVE IT'S A LOT MORE ENERGY NOW TO PUMP DEEPER AND DEEPER AND ABOUT RIGHT NOW ABOUT STATE IS MOVING TREATING HER PUMPING GROUNDWATER. SO THIS THIS IS JUST AN OVERVIEW OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I TEND TO TALK IN POWER POINTS ANYWAY ARE BULLETS- ON IDEAS THAT YOU MIGHT THINK OF AND YOU'RE GOING TO CERTAINLY ADD TO HIM- DURING THESE DISCUSSIONS THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES TODAY AS WELL AS YESTERDAY. IS ON THIS TOPIC AND I'M GETTING A PHONE CALLS UP WHAT CAN BE DONE TO WHAT MAKES IT MUCH STRONGER AND COMPLY WITH THE INTENT TO SO THAT WE- ARE GROUND WATER WHICH IS 60% OF OUR SUPPLY DURING. I YEARS. IS NOT. OVER AND THE AND- PARTICULARLY TO OTHER WATER USERS WHO ARE LEFT HIGH AND DRY. SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO STRENGTHEN SIGNUP PERHAPS. AND YOU'RE THE EXPERTS NOW BUT BRING IN EVERYONE YOU CAN MEET WITH- ARE WE OPERATING TOO MUCH INSIDE. SILOS IS THE PART IN A WATER RESOURCES WHICH IS FOR THE SUPPLY SIDE OF THE STATE WATER BOARD CAN THEY BE. BETTER COORDINATED HOW ABOUT THE REGIONAL WATER- DISTRICTS IN THE AREA. HOW DO WE ACCELERATE THE TIMETABLE FOR CYSTS WITHIN ABILITY COMPLIANCE. CAN WE WAIT TWENTY MORE YEARS. PROBABLY NOT YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF IT IS TO BOOST ENSURE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER THERE WAS ACTUALLY STATE LEGISLATION BY MIKE INGLIS DUTY CHOOSE A HUSBAND ON INTO AT THE STATE RIGHT THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT AND IT'S GROWING- UP CONSIDER CONSEQUENCES FOR PATIENTS WHO DO NOT SUBMIT COMPLETE FANS HAVE A DONE SO DID NOT IN. JANUARY OF THIS YEAR WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES HOW CAN WE HELP OF HOW WE CAN HELP WE MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. WE'RE FINDING OUT THAT THERE'S A REASONABLE USE OF WATER DUE TO OVER PUMPING- IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE THEM LEGALLY COMPLY. IT'S NOT OVER PUMPING AND I USED THE TERM AND REASONABLE USE BECAUSE THAT'S A LEGALLY. IMPORTANT TERM THAT CAN BE. THAT CAN RESULT IN POSSIBLE LEGAL ACTION IF YOU ARE OVER PUMPING IT'S IN A REASONABLE NOT BENEFICIAL USED TO THE WATER SUPPLY I'M A BIG FAN OF WATER AND ENERGY AND NEXUS I MENTIONED ABOUT 18% OF OUR WATER. IS TIED IN TO- WATER PUMPING. TRANSPORTATION AND HEATING OF WATER IT'S TIED INTO CLIMATE CHANGE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THERE'S A GROWING INTEREST BY THE PACIFIC INSTITUTE NEXT TEND. AND FOUNDATIONS ALL OVER THE STATE AND TYING AND OUR OPPORTUNITIES OF. STRENGTHENING OUR WATER SUPPLY WITH ALSO REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF. ALSO FEELS REQUIRED TO MOVE TREAT HE'S OUR WATER. ALSO WITH PERHAPS AS PART OF THE THIRTY THIRTY PLAN THAT THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY IS LOOKING AT YOU MIGHT LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO RESTORE WATERSHEDS AND WETLANDS AND HOW THAT WOULD INCREASE OUR WATER SUPPLY I'M ON THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD RIGHT NOW AND- WATERSHEDS ARE BEING FUNDED FOR RESTORATION AND NEED FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS YEAR AND ABOUT AS WHICH SHOULD INCREASE DOWNSTREAM WATER. AVAILABILITY HOW CAN WE REDUCE WATER INTENSIVE YEAR ROUND CROPS ESPECIALLY IN THE OVER DRAFTED. BASINS THIS IS FAR DIFFERENT THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO THE AMOUNT OF SPECIALLY. ALMONDS AND PISTACHIOS- THAT ARE GROWN THAT REQUIRE INCREDIBLE BATTLE WATER OPERATIONS TAKE. GROUNDWATER FROM OUR LOCAL BASINS THAT'S A GROWING PROBLEM THAT MAY NEED- YOUR- YOUR- ADVICE- WHICH SHOULD WATER AND HERE'S A POLITICALLY VERY HOT LEGAL QUESTION BE REGULATED AS A PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHT OR IS IT ANY PUBLIC BENEFIT. THAT'S SOMETHING BUILDING TO TALK ABOUT IT. UNDER THE BILL- NINETEEN FOURTEEN RIGHTS IS DETERMINED- MAYBE THAT'S OUT OF DATE BUT I A AND POLITICALLY THAT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENED IT PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED. NEARLY 90% OF WHAT WE GROWED REPORTEDLY NOW SENT OVERSEAS AND NOT TO OUR STATE AND THOSE ARE THOSE YEAR ROUND CROPS. LOCAL GROUNDWATER BASINS WANT TO REPORT MANAGER ON SUPPLY WHAT WE DO SOME CAN'T OR WON'T DO SO AND LASTLY ALL OF US ARE GOING TO HAVE TO. LOOK AT WATER AS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO OUR SURVIVAL AS A STATE SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE T ONCE IF NOT TWICE. REDUCED AMOUNT THE USE AND RECYCLE WATER AND THAT MEANS EVERYONE- COOLEY IN URBAN AREAS AS WELL AS AGRICULTURAL AREAS. THIS IS JUST A FEW THOUGHTS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND I'D BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS DURING THE DISCUSSION AT A LATER TIME AND I'M VERY HAPPY. TO BE SHARING THIS PLATFORM WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROGER DICKINSON SORT OF THE SECRET TO OUR SUCCESS IS THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER- ROGER DICKINSON STAFF AT MY STAFF MY STAFF HAD LED BY DENNIS O'CONNOR IS STILL IN THE BUILDING- WE WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THAT. SEVERAL BILLS WHERE WE COULD- MENDHAM IS THE PROCESS WENT ALONG. AND OF COURSE COMPROMISES IMPORTANT ONE PASSING A BILL AND- IT BUT IT WAS A VERY- WORTHWHILE PROCESS AND NOW IT'S UP TO YOU TO MAKE SURE. THIS IS UPDATED AT SIGMA IS DOING WHAT IT'S INTENDED TO DO AND THAT'S ESTABLISH. SUSTAINABILITY REQUIREMENT FOR ALL GROUND BASIN AND- SO YOU VERY MUCH ALLOWING ME SPEND ON WITH YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR AND IF YOU DON'T MIND HANGING ON WE WILL. MOVE ON TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER DICKINSON AND WE WILL CHAT WITH YOU I'M SURE THEY'LL BE QUESTIONS AFTER HIS PRESENTATION. SO IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER DICKINSON AVAILABLE. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. THANKS FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY- I'M ROGER DICKINSON FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER AND ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT WHICH YOU ALL KNOW IS SICK MONTH NINE STEP BY THE WAY WAS NEVER- CALL BACK DURING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT- THAT NAME ROSE AFTERWARDS SO WE'VE ALL ADOPTED IT- I'M CURRENTLY THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CIVIC WELL FORMERLY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMISSION. AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO JOIN SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY- THIS MORNING- SHE'S GIVING YOU. SOME VERY GOOD THINGS TO THINK ABOUT- I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THREE AREAS AND GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF PERHAPS- MORE THE QUALITATIVE FLAVOR OF A SICK MIND AND AS WE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THOUGHT ABOUT HOW WE WOULD ATTACK THIS ISSUE OF- GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT IN THAT THAT WAS- SO DRAMATIC AS UNDER PAPILLAE- HAS DESCRIBED AND SOME OF YOU HAVE DESCRIBED IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS. AT THE AT THE OUTSET LET ME LET ME SAY THAT WORKING WITH SENATOR TAVALY CLOSELY WAS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL TO OUR SUCCESS IN ENACTING SIGMA- IN ADDITION THE ALIGNMENT UNITY AND EXPERTISE OF THIS ASSEMBLY STAFF THE SENATE STAFF IN THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF WERE KEY ELEMENTS IN MAKING. SIGMAR LAW. AS SENATOR PER NO WE HAVE SUPPORT FOR THE F. FROM A HOST OF ORGANISE. RANGING FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES TO THE WATER FOUNDATION AND THEY ALSO PLAYED. AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE. UNDENIABLE REALITY COMPELLED THE ADOPTION OF SIGMA IN DROUGHT YEARS 60% OR MORE OF OUR WATER SUPPLY COMES FROM GROUNDWATER. DECADES OF OVER DRAFTING HAD LED TO AFFECTS SUCH AS SERIOUS SUBSIDENCE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO SEE WATER INTRUSION TWO DRINKING WATER WELLS SERVING ENTIRE COMMUNITIES DRYING UP. ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN DISCUSSED FOR FORTY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAD NEVER HAD STATE REGULATION OF GROUNDWATER INDEED CALIFORNIA STOOD OUT AS THE ONLY STATE IN THE WEST TO NOT DO SO. FIVE TWENTY FOURTEEN WE COULD SIMPLY NO LONGER AFFORD TO WAIT ANY LONGER. THE DESIGN AND STRUCTURE OF SIGMA IS UNUSUAL IF NOT UNIQUE. AT THE CORE IT WAS FASHIONED ON EXPERIENCE- ACTUALLY THAT I HAD AS A SACRAMENTO COUNTY SUPERVISOR. AT ONE POINT WE WERE COME UP WITH THE PROPOSAL. FOR MEASURES WHICH WOULD BRING US INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT HOWEVER AMONG THE VARIOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND INTEREST GROUPS WE COULD NOT SEEM TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON MEASURES THAT WOULD PROJECT TO MEET OUR FEDERAL OBLIGATIONS. AFTER PROTECTED A PROTRACTED PERIOD WITHOUT A RESOLUTION USEPA TOLD US IF WE FAIL TO OFFER A SUITABLE PLAN THEY WOULD IMPOSE ONE ON US. THEY DANGLED SUCH RESTRICTIONS AS ALLOWING DRIVING ONLY EVERY OTHER DAY BASED ON LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS AND PARKING RANGE THAT WOULD BE ASTRONOMICAL. THEY PLAYED THE QUINTESSENTIAL BAD COP. GIVEN THEIR THREAT TO NO SURPRISE WE CAME UP WITH A PLAN. OF LOCAL DEVELOPED MEASURES WHICH SATISFIED BOTH EPA AND US. WE APPLIED THAT LESSON WHEN STRUCTURING SIGMA IT WAS FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITIES ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO ADDRESS LOCAL CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN GIVEN CLEAR DIRECTION AND SPECIFIC GOALS WE GAVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES A LARGE DEGREE OF DISCRETION AND FORMING GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES OR GSA'S. ALTHOUGH THE STATUTE IS CLEAR THE GSA'S EITHER ON THEIR OWN OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER GSA'S MUST ACHIEVE SUSTAINABILITY IN THEIR BASE AND THEY COULDN'T AVOID IT BY SOME ARTIFICE. OR CONSTRUCT WE UNDERSTOOD THAT MOVING TO SUSTAINABILITY WOULD IMPOSE AN ARDUOUS TECHNICAL AND PROGRAMMATIC CHALLENGE FOR LOCAL ENTITIES. THEREFORE WE DIRECTED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WOULD BE GIVEN THE ROLE OF ASSISTING GSA'S INFORMING AND ONCE FORMED IN MEETING THE CHALLENGES GSA'S FACED. THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF GSA'S IS TO PRODUCE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS OR G. S. P.'S WHICH IDENTIFY AN OUTLINE THE ROADMAP TO SUSTAINABILITY. SIGNAL STRUCTURE WAS ALSO BUILT TO INCLUDE STATE REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF G. S. P.'S SO THAT THERE WOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR GSA'S TO DEVELOP AND ADOPT REAL AND MEASURABLE PLANS SUCH REVIEW IS ESSENTIAL SINCE WE REALIZED THAT SOME LOCAL OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITIES MIGHT FIND IT TOO DIFFICULT OR BEYOND WILLING TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL. IMPLEMENTATION FINALLY. WE DESIGNATED THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO STEP IN AND IMPLEMENT PLANS AND MEASURES TO REACH SUSTAINABILITY IF NECESSARY. WITH THE HOPE THAT THE SPECTER OF THE STATE PLAYING SUCH A ROLE WOULD BE COMPELLING TO LOCAL OFFICIALS TO TAKE ACTION ON THEIR OWN INSTEAD. SO SIMPLY PUT SEGMENT IS STRUCTURED TO GIVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS TO REACH GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY. IT IS THE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO BOTH ASSIST. LOCAL EFFORTS AND TO REQUIRE ADHERENCE TO THE OVER ARCHING PURPOSE OF CIGNA CIGNA NAMELY REACHING SUSTAINABILITY. AND IT IS THE ROLE OF THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO STEP IN AND TAKE THE PLACE OF LOCAL ENTITIES THAT CANNOT OR WILL NOT FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO ENSURE THAT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WE WOULD BE ON TRACK TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE. GROUNDWATER BASINS YEARS AS THE HORIZON BY WHICH BASINS MUST REACH SUSTAINABILITY WITH THE BALANCING OF TWO IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS. FIRST THE URGENCY OF RESTORING GROUNDWATER VIABILITY WAS MANIFEST WITH MANY BASE AND SUBJECT TO SO MUCH OVER DRAFTING FOR SO MANY YEARS BUT NOT ONLY WERE PROPERTY OWNERS DRILLING DEEPER AND DEEPER WELLS WITH SHALLOWER WELLS DRYING UP. BUT SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDENCE OF AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FEET HAD OCCURRED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. SECOND BECAUSE OVER DRAFTING HAD TAKEN PLACE FOR DECADES. IN BASINS INTO A SUSTAINABLE CONDITION. OBVIOUSLY WAS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. NOW BALLOTS IN THOSE TEN THINGS NEVERTHELESS A GSA CANNOT SIMPLY DELAY TAKING ACTION UNTIL TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS IN THE FUTURE. ASK OUR MAINS URGENT ESPECIALLY WITH THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND MEASURABLE PROGRESS TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY REQUIRED UNDERSTATEMENT IS AN ONGOING TEST WITH PERIODIC FIVE YEAR REVIEWS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES OF EACH PLANT. THE THIRD POINT. THIS MORNING I WANT TO JUST. MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT IS THAT CIGNA UNDERSCORES THE PRINCIPLE OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE INTERESTS OF ALL BENEFICIAL USERS. HISTORICALLY THOSE WITH GREATER ECONOMIC POWER AND RESOURCES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RELY ON GROUNDWATER EVEN AS AQUIFER'S HAVE DECLINED AND OTHER USERS HAVE LOST. THEIR ACCESS OR WATCHED IT DIMINISH ESPECIALLY SMALL FARMERS AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. SIGMAR RECOGNIZES THAT SUSTAINABILITY MEANS ALL BENEFICIAL USERS MUST ENJOY ACCESS TO GROUNDWATER ON A FAIR AND REASONABLE BASIS EVEN AS WE ENSURE THERE IS NO AS THE STATUTE BUT SAID CHRONIC LOWERING OF GROUNDWATER LEVELS INDICATING A SIGNIFICANT AND ON REASONABLE DEPLETION OF SUPPLY. IN THE MIDST OF DROUGHT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. THE LEGISLATURE ACTED TO SEPARATE COURSE FOR THE STATE TO REGULATE FOR THE FIRST TIME A MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE OUR GROUNDWATER. SOME OBSERVERS CALLED IT THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA WATER LAW IN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS. THE CURRENT DROUGHT AND THE GROWING REALITY THE CLIMATE CHANGE WILL ONLY INTENSIFY. DICTATES THAT WE INSIST THAT SEGMENT BE RIGOROUSLY AND FAITHFULLY CARRIED OUT TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH OUR ECONOMY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. THANKS VERY MUCH. AUSTIN'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER- BEFORE GOING TO IN AND OTHER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. FOR COMMENTS. I DON'T SEE YEAH SURE ASSEMBLY WERE LACKING YEAH PLEASE PARDON ME IF I MISSED BECAUSE I ARRIVED A LITTLE BIT TARDY BUT- ONE OF THE BIG CRISIS POINTS THAT WE HAVE I LIVE IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA IN THE DESERT WHERE- GROUNDWATER HAS ALWAYS BEEN. A FOCUS BUT NOW WE HAVE THE ILLEGAL OR ILLICIT CANNABIS GROWERS THERE AND WE'RE WE'RE DEALING NOT ONLY WITH WATER CONTAMINATION AS AS A PROBLEM BUT ALSO WATER THEFT AND OUR LOCAL AGENCIES ARE HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. MANAGING OF THESE BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS AND I WONDERED IF YOU HAD AT LEAST AWARENESS OF THE SITUATION. THE SERVICE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DICKINSON RIGHT DOWN TO THAT OR CENTER POWERPOINT- I WILL I DON'T KNOW IF CENTER PROBABLY IS STILL AVAILABLE BUT- AND IT'S ONLY MEMBER LACKEY- CENTER PAVLEY IN FACT MENTION THAT IN IN HER REMARKS- IT WAS NOT AN ISSUE FRANKLY- IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SO IT IS NOT ADDRESSED- IT LEAST IT WASN'T AN ISSUE THAT AROSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONSIDERATION OF. OF THE LEGISLATION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SO IT'S NOT ADDRESS DIRECTLY- BY THE STATUTE I THINK IT IS. CLEARLY A PROBLEM- NOT ONLY IN IN YOUR PART OF THE STATE BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AS WELL AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT- I THINK- YOUR GOOD ATTENTION TO- CURRENTLY- IT DOES IS A VERY MUCH NEEDED SO- WE WOULD EXPECT I THINK UNDER CURRENT LAW THE TYPICAL MECHANISMS FOR- POLICING- AND ENFORCING THE LAW WITH RESPECT TO CONTAMINATED WATER. THE ILLEGAL USE OF WATER TO APPLY BUT THERE MAY BE MORE SPECIFIC MEASURES THAT- YOU YOU AS THE CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE BELIEVE. ARE ARE NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE. I BELIEVE WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR ME ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OUR KIDS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M IN THANK YOU BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER TAKEN SENATE CENTER PROBABLY FOR LEADERSHIP IN THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AREA. AND IT'S ALWAYS I THINK IMPRESSIVE TO LOOK IN HINDSIGHT AND SEE HOW HELPFUL IT IS TO GET US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. IS ALREADY CONTINUE MENTIONED THAT WHEN YOU PASS THIS BILL. YOU BELIEVE THE SCEPTER OF THE STATE TAKING OVER WAS GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO GET LOCAL AGENCIES TO DO WHAT WE WANTED THEM TO DO TO SUSTAINABLY MANAGE GROUNDWATER. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY WE SEE THAT THERE ARE MANY THAT HAVE NOT DONE THAT. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT SORT OF IN. A LARGE NUMBER OF IT MAY BE UNDER THAT- CONTROL AND GIVEN THAT. I GUESS I WONDER A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT WHERE WE SHOULD GO FROM THERE AND ARE THERE OTHER MEANS OF ENFORCEMENT THAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER. WELL I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- ADAM CHAIR I THINK THAT- WE TRYING TO DESIGN AN APPROACH THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY- STIMULATE. LOCAL OFFICIALS TO IN EFFECT BITE THE BULLET AND WE KNOW THAT THIS CAN BE A VERY DIFFICULT. UNDERTAKING AND A NUMBER OF PLACES AROUND THE STATE BUT THE- BUT THE- THE PROCESS OF. HAVING D. W. R. REVIEW PLANS TO COMMENT ON PLANS TO REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT- PLANS. ARE UPGRADING THE PLANS AS THEY ARE GOING THROUGH NOW WITH THE WITH A NUMBER OF GSA'S. AND THEN IF THERE'S A FAILURE TO DO SO TO PUT THAT AND TO PUT THOSE BASINS IN A PROBATIONARY STATUS THAT BRINGS IN THE WHAT THE- STATE. WATER BOARD. TO TAKE- I'M MORE ACTIVE ROLE I MEAN ALL THESE ARE STEPS THAT WE THAT WE DESIGNED IN WITH WITH THE HOPE FRANKLY THAT- THAT. LOCAL OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITIES- WHAT DO WHAT WHAT HAS TO BE DONE- IS THERE MORE ENFORCEMENT OR- ADDITIONAL MEASURES REQUIRED AT AT AT THIS STAGE. IT MAY BE A LITTLE TOO SOON TO KNOW THE ANSWER. TO THAT. UNTIL WE SEE HOW THE PROCESS WORKS WITH. WITH RESPECT TO THE POTENTIAL FOR D. W. R. REVIEW AND- PROBATIONARY STATUS FOR BASINS TO SEE IF THAT. IF THAT SEQUENCE. OF TEPS ACTUALLY- IS EFFECTIVE IN IN GETTING THOSE- BASINS AND GSA'S THAT HAVE BEEN. SOMEWHAT MORE RETICENT- TO STEP UP TO AND IN FACT TO DO SO. TO LIVE UP TO THEIR X. THERE- I THINK WE WILL WAIT AND SEE. ANY OTHER AG CAN WE HONOR THAT PLEASE YEAH OUT I AGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. DICKINSON THERE ISN'T ONE DIRECT ANSWER HERE BUT I THINK THAT THE COMBINATION OF CHOICES HERE FIRST OF ALL WHY DID THOSE- GALLAGHER BASIN TO HAVE FIVE YEARS NOT COMPLY WITH THE COMPLETED PLAN WHICH IS JUST STEP ONE ON TIME. AND HOW MUCH STAFF DOES THE STATE HAVE TO PRINT WE CAN AND DO THAT FOR THEM THAT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE YET HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO SPEND THIS IS A GOOD TIME GENERAL FUND WISE IF THE PRIORITY. BUT ALSO HOW CAN WE STOP- THE- THAT ARE GOING ON THAT ARE ACCELERATING THE PROBLEMS SO YOU HAVE. THE ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY BUT THEN ARE THERE. ACTRESSES FOR EXAMPLE IT SHOULD THOSE BASINS THAT ARE SEVERELY OVER PUMPING THE GROUNDWATER SPECIALLY IN AREAS THAT ARE AFFECTING PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER SHOULD THEY BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO GROW YEAR ROUND CROPS THAT ARE VERY WATER INTENSIVE. SHOULD THEY BE ABLE TO A FEW OF THOSE PEOPLE PUMP ALL THE WATER TO THE BOTTOM IT MAY TAKE SOME. LEGAL CHALLENGES ON BENEFICIAL USE- I'M NOT A LAWYER. OR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO PUT EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE AND I WOULD SUGGEST ALSO GOING BACK AND LOOKING AT THE PEOPLE WHO DID THOSE EXCELLENT REPORTS AT THE BEGINNING WATER FOR THINGS THAT THE RESOURCES LEGACY FUND. MAY DO THEY HELPED WITH THE FUNDING OF THAT WATER FOUNDATION PLANS WHAT WOULD AWKWARD SUGGESTION DOING BECAUSE WE KNOW THE STATUS QUO IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH THAT'S WHY THIS HEARING IS IMPORTANT AND YOU SHOULD. PROBABLY HEAR FROM A VARIETY OF PEOPLE BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO STOP WHERE THE ABUSES ARE. ESPECIALLY IN THE MODERATE TO SEVERELY OVER DRAFT BASINS. USE THE THIRTY THIRTY PLAN TO TRY TO. SAVE THE FINALLY THE GROUNDWATER BUT THE WATERSHED FROM- BEING ABUSED AS WELL AND CRACK DOWN ON PEOPLE THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON CAN'T OR WON'T MANAGE THEIR GROUNDWATER BASIN CAN YOU IMAGINE SHARING A PROPERTY WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND ONE PROPERTY OWNER IN YOUR GROUP OF FIVE NOT BEING ABLE. USING UP ALL THE LAND SO- THAT SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING AND I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT A VARIETY OF REASONS. BUT AT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THOSE INDIVIDUAL BASINS. AND MANAGER TO ADD ONE FURTHER NOTE ON ON THIS I ALSO THINK THERE'S A ROLE FOR INCENTIVIZING LOCALITIES TO DO THE RIGHT THING SO- FUNDING THAT THAT- COMES THROUGH THE DROUGHT AND WATER RESILIENCE PACKAGE FOR EXAMPLE- TO AUGMENT THE SWEET PROGRAM OR PROVIDE FUNDING FOR MOVING TO. TO MORE EFFICIENT USE OF OUR WATER- THE- MULTI BENEFIT LAND RE PURPOSING PROGRAM THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR- I THINK HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO HELP. LAND LANDOWNERS IN VARIOUS PLACES MOVE MOVE AWAY FROM- MORE INTENSIVE USE OF WATER- TO- THE USING PLANNED FOR- OTHER PURPOSES AND- RECHARGING GROUNDWATER IN THE IN THE PROCESS SO I THINK THAT'S A PROGRAM THAT THAT DEFINITELY- SHOULD BE SHOULD BE AUGMENTED- BUT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I THINK. CAN HELP ALTHOUGH I THINK CENTER PAVEL IS. EXACTLY RIGHT IN HER REMARKS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST HAVE A QUICK CMMENT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I SAID ON THE YOLO COUNTY WATER AGENCY AND THAT'S ONE. OF THIS BILL HAD GONE THROUGH AND THERE WAS A LOT OF CONVERSATION AND- AND- CHALLENGES WORKING WITH OUR FARMERS THEY WERE NOT REAL HAPPY ABOUT SOMEBODY TELLING THEM WHEN THEY COULD PUMP THE WATER WHEN THEY COULDN'T PUMP THE WATER AND- OF THE NUMBER ONE THING WE HAD TO DO IS DO EDUCATION TO THE FARMERS AND THEY ACTUALLY. CAME AROUND IT TOOK SOMETIME BUT THEY DID COME AROUND I THINK YOU'LL COUNTY HAS A VERY GOOD PLAN FOR THEIR GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU IN THE SENATOR- AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DICKINSON FOR ALL THE WORK YOU DIDN'T YOU HAVE A VISION. JUST LIKE ANY BILL WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HOW DO YOU FIX IT BUT THE HARDEST PART IS THE IMPLEMENTATION I'M GLAD REVISITING THIS SORT OF WE NEED TO FINE TUNE IT MAKE IT BETTER. SO BE IT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE. HAND THANK YOU MANAGE WHAT DID WE HAVE. MISTER I DO HAVE A QUESTION. SO I THINK BOTH FOR PRESENTING TODAY AND WE ARE DEFINITELY IN A- IN REGARDS TO ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS I THINK I JUST REALLY WANNA AS I'M LIKE KIND OF STIRRED HERE- WHAT DO YOU. TRUCKLOADS OF WATER OUT OF AG WELLS AND THE WATER RESOURCE BOARD AS TIGHT AS THEY HAVE NO ENFORCEMENT. TRUCKLOADS WATER TRUCKLOADS WATER TRUCKS YOU SEE THEM. FIFTY A DAY. FIFTY A DAY. WHY HAVE FARMERS WHO SPENT A MILLION DOLLARS OF THEIR OWN MONEY TO COME UP WITH THE PLAN. SMALL FARMERS WHERE I LIVE. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THESE THINGS AND LOOK AT THEM WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WATER BOND WAS ALSO. PASSED IN TWENTY. FOURTEEN CORRECT SO WE'RE GONNA DO GROUND WATER WE NEED TO WATER STORAGE AS WELL THIS NEEDS A WHOLE CONVERSATION AND WE DO NEED TO BRING THE FARMERS IN HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER I'M A THANKFUL I'M A DRYLAND WHEAT FARMER. WE HAVE NO WATER WE HAVE NO INDICATION SO I'M NOT BEING REGULATED. COMES FROM THE SKY. SO THERE'S A IT'S A HUGE CONVERSATION AND TO TALK ABOUT I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING OF KEVIN MITCHELL AND- NOW BOUGHT MY LAST OCCASION BRIGHTER A MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE SAKE PRODUCERS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN. THAT IS WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE THE GOOD ACTORS RIGHT WITH THEIR NEEDS A WAY FOR THEM TO BE RE THEY'VE SUBMITTED ON TIME THEY'VE DONE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO YOU. SHOULD BE A WAY THEY CAN GET THAT MONEY BACK THAT CAME OUT OF THEIR POCKET. IT WAS NOT GRANT MONEY SO. I'M A LITTLE SCARED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I AM A FORMER. AND THIS LOOKS DIFFERENTLY ON THE OTHER SIDE SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR CONVERSATION I. IN CONJUNCTION WITH WATER STORAGE AS WELL AS MANAGING OUR GROUNDWATER. I'M THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- YEAH THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT I THINK IN MY REMARKS AT THE BEGINNING I SAID THAT AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS TO BE AND ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH TO WATER AND STORAGE IS ABSOLUTELY. HAVE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT BUT SO IS THE MANAGEMENT OR GROUND WATER IN THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING TODAY- AND WITH THAT YOU MENTION WE NEED TO. HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SO LET'S MOVE ON A PANEL TO. WHICH WILL BE ON. THE STATUS THE IMPLEMENTATION STATUS OF SIGMA. AND THE GOOD AND THE BAD IN THE SUSTAINABLE. THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS WILL START WITH PAUL GOSSELIN DEPUTY DIRECTOR SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES- ARE YOU ONLINE PAUL. CAN YOU GIVE ME YEP. VERY GOOD THANK YOU- THANK YOU CHAIR THE VICE CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PAUL GOSSELIN DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN UPDATE ON SEGMENTATION. TO BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT AT THIS EARLY STAGE SEGMENT IS FUNCTIONING WELL AND MILESTONES ARE BEING MET. THE PROCESS EVEN WITH- PLANS THAT ARE INCOMPLETE- IS WORKING AND WE'RE PUTTING OUR REGULATORY RULES IN PLACE. ADDITIONALLY GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES HAVE STEPPED UP TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT PLANS THAT ARE LEADING TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY AND MANY HAVE. A THEIR OWN INVESTMENTS IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE STATE'S BEEN PROVIDED. STRONG FOUNDATIONS BUILT UPON AFFECT NOT JUST WHAT WE DO A DEEP DIVE YOU ARE BUT OUR PARTNERS AT THE STATE BOARD AGENCIES- COUNTIES. ACADEMIA NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND JUST COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO PARTICIPATED APPLYING IMPORTANT ROLES IN IMPLEMENTATION. ALL THOSE BEEN SOLID PROGRESS TO DATE AND WE ARE EARLY THIS MUCH MORE WORK AHEAD AN IMPORTANT. JUST TO BE MADE- I'M GOING TO SHARE- COUPLES. IS OF MY PRESENTATION- AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT- DON'T HAVE SHEER. YOU SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHARE. I'M SHOWING. TRY IT ONE MORE TIME. SOMEHOW MY SHARE CONTENT IS. THE SYSTEMS ARE GREAT WHEN THEY WORK WE UNDERSTAND. EIGHT FIVE I APOLOGIZE BUT I DON'T LEARN. OKAY WHY I THANK. COMMITTEE STAFF- SAYS HE HAS IS IT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO PUT IT UP HERE TO. OKAY. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY APOLOGIES. SO WHAT I COULD DO IN THE MEANTIME I COULD JUST TALK THROUGH WITHOUT THE SLIDES IF THAT WILL WORK. LET'S GO FOR IT AND IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IT UP WE WILL. ALL RIGHT. IT IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS BUT I'LL TRY TO KEEP MY EYE OUT. PRESENTATION UNDER THE BOX. SO- REALLY WHERE DOES NOT APPLY THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN SUBBASIN STOCKS STATE AND IT WAS DECIDED IT'S PRESENTED EARLIER- THE HIGH AND MEDIUM PRIORITY BASINS WERE THE ONES THAT ARE WE GONNA BE SUBJECT SIX MONTHS. THE OTHER LOW AND VERY LOW OUR PARTY BASINS COULD VOLUNTARILY SUBMIT PLANTS- SO THAT NINETY FOUR HIGH AND MEDIUM PRIORITY BASINS- INCLUDING TWENTY ONE THAT ARE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED IN CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS HAD. UP TILL TWENTY TWENTY TO SUBMIT PLANS AND THAT REMAINS OF THE HIGH IN MEDIA HI IN MEDIA PARTY BASINS I HAD TILL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE OTHER KEY ARE MILESTONE THAT WAS REACHED EARLY ONWARDS THE FORMATION OF OUR GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES- AND THE SUBMISSION OF. GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS- DID MEET THE MILESTONES FOR TWENTY TWENTY IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE ALL THE PLANS THAT. WERE DUE IN JANUARY HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AND ARE. NOW CLOSED FOR COMMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO- ELSEWHERE TO THE DISCUSSION OF DELIVERY OUT TO ROLLING SIX MONTHS- ONE IS OUR REGULAR. OVERSIGHT ROLE- BUT FIRST OF LIKE TO WITH HOURS BROUGHT- THOSE. VERY WHAT DO BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW IT IT IS OUR PRIME TASK. TO- INSURE THAT THESE BROWN STAND AGENCIES- DO HAVE COMPLY. PLANS THAT YOU'RE COMPLY WITH THE LAW REGULAR BUT WERE ALSO ASSIST IN THEIR EFFORT- TO GET TOWARDS. BECAUSE AT THE END THE DAY THAT'S REALLY REALLY AREN'T IS TO ENSURE THE- CALIFORNIA'S GROUNDWATER THE LOCAL. COMMUNITIES IN BUYING A NEW CAR EIGHT. HOURS WILL- EXXON THINK THAT IS GOOD SO WE COULD GO. FIVE FOUR. AND I'LL IN WITH US OF THE SYSTEMS PRO. SO TOO MANY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND- INVESTED TO DATE- ONE PROGRAM SO DOLLARS HAS BEEN AWARDED TO AND THOSE COVERS- HELLO OF ASPECTS GROUNDWATER- TO STANDING BELOW PLAN TO TELL. OUR AS WELL AS SOME IMPLEMENT STEP THAT INCLUDES- DEVELOPMENT OF- OUR RECHARGE PROJECTS OTHER WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS TO HELP SUSTAIN THE BASIC- IT'S ALL. ENGAGED I READ GAVE EFFORTS WHICH WAS SICK MOST OF THEM VERY BAR- FOR ENGAGED- AND WE'RE REALLY WHAT TO THAT THOSE AGENCIES ON TAKING TECHNICAL IS ACTUALLY YOU A LOT OF BASINS DID HAVE A SOLID FOUNDATION ON WATER MANAGEMENT- BUT ELECTED NOT AND WE ALSO WANTED TO PROVIDE A FLOOR FOR CONSISTENCY OF USING THE BEST SCIENCE THAT'S AVAILABLE. ARE ONE TOOL THAT WE HAVE COME OUT WITH THIS- THAT GROUNDWATER DATA AND TOOLS ARE READILY AVAILABLE- I SHOULD POINT OUT JUST RELEASED. THERE ARE CALIFORNIA GROUNDWATER THAT'S CALLED BULLETIN ONE EIGHTEEN EARLIER THIS YEAR AND ACCOMPANYING MATH- WAS CALL CALIFORNIA GROUNDWORK ALIVE WHICH TAKES A LOT OF OUR DATA. SUBSIDENCE OUR WATER SUPPLY- THE END USE IN A WAY THAT IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE- COULD NOT ONLY AGENCIES BUT THE PUBLIC IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE ENGAGING IN- THE- IMPLEMENTATION OF STIGMA THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO OUR DATA AND TOOLS. FANSERVICE. LICENSE DATA- WE'RE DATA WHICH IS GOING TO GET WE VERY SHORTLY AND DEMO THE READY SIDE WE ARE CROSS STATE AND NOW WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN BACK ARE SUBSIDENCE ARTHROPATHY ARE IT WARNED ALECTO MATT MEDICAL ARE YOU SEE THAT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WITH THE WHO- THIS WILL A NOTHER- DRUG RESULTS- FUNDING THE WE GOT THIS YEAR UT ALL TIED CLOSE TO WHAT AGENCIES NEED FOR. WHAT IT DOES IS ALMOST LIKE A AND M. R. FOR- THE SORT IT CHOOSE A LOT OF MAGNETICS DOWN AND- ALLOWS US TO- BASICALLY MAP OUT THE GEOLOGIC ARCHITECTURE DOESN'T FIND WATER BUT IT ABSOLUTELY. G. A LOCKET. OCT OF THE SOIL. NOT A LOT OF THE BETTER PLACE OF WELL I. RECHARGE I THANK SUPPORT WE DO INSTALL MONITOR WELLS- WELL THE STATE WITHOUT A HIGH TWENTY MARCH THOUSAND TODAY. I GONNA HUNDREDS OF EIGHT MARCH WELLS IN THE PROCESS. BEING INSTALLED IN A DAY. TO STREAM. AT- BECAUSE- STE. ARE IS CRITICAL AS WELL AS BOB TO AND THEN HE GOES- AND AGAIN- NEW EFFORTS ON WHY COME. WATER TRAY- ANY. ARE THAT ARE LOOKING TO BALANCE THEIR ARE BROWN WANTED BASED OUT. ARE GOING TO HELP OUR FOR AND LIMIT THE ALLOCATION OF GROUND. HAVING TOOLS BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND IT'S IT WAS GOING TO BE- I THINK OUR REGIONAL OFFICES HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL- WE ALSO PROVIDE- WE HAVE- ENGAGING WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS- AND WE'VE PRODUCED MANY OUR COMMUNICATION ENGAGEMENT GUIDANCE THE GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS ARE TO HELP ASSIST AND GUIDE THE AGENCIES ON NOT JUST. YOUKNOW APPROACH IS THE NEED TO TAKE BUT WHAT WE DO IS THE COMPLIANCE THEY'LL TAKE IN REVEALING HOW THE CONDUCTING THEIR BUSINESS AND- STAND ABILITY. ONE ASPECT THAT'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FACILITATION SUPPORT SERVICES- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT DURING THE GROUND WATER GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENT- IN THE FACILITATORS- WORK. WITH THE AGENCIES BUT ALSO A LOT FOR GOING TO ENJOY OUR COMMUNICATION WITH PUBLIC OF PUBLIC MEETINGS TO REALLY ALLOW THE. AGENCIES TO GET BOTH- FOR ENGAGEMENT THE PUBLIC AND IT'S BEEN A NUMBER SO IMPORTANT FOR GSA FORMATION AND NOW THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS- THAT WORKS CONTINUED AND NOW IN THEM IMPLEMENTATIONS BECOMING EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. ARE WRITTEN LIKE TRANSLATION SERVICES- WE HAVE TRANSACTION SERVICES FOR DOCUMENTS AGENCIES HAVE UP TO EIGHT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES R. AS WELL AS OTHER PUBLIC EDUCATION AND- MATERIALS GONNA SWITCH TO OUR REGULATORY ROLE- AND THE NEXT SLIDE WILL DESCRIBE THE OF THE PROCESS. WE'RE FOLLOWING- YES NEXT SLIDE PLEASE- SO THAT'S ANOTHER NUMBER PATHWAYS WE HAVE TWO YEARS TO REVIEW PLANS IS THAT IS THE CEMENT- ONCE THEY SUBMIT THEM INTO THE DEPARTMENT I SHOULD NOTE THAT WHEN AGENCIES EVEN THE PLAN THAT WAS SUBMITTED IN TWENTY TWENTY THEY DID NOT WAIT FOR US TO REVIEW AND APPROVE OF THE PLANTS ARE GIVE THEM FEEDBACK- THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY TASKED WITH STARTING TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PLANS IN A NUMBER OF AGENCIES WAS TAKEN- VERY MEANINGFUL STEPS TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY. WHILE WE COMPLETED THEIR REVIEW- SO WHEN I REVIEW IS DONE WE HAVE A COUPLE PATHWAYS- ONE IS APPROVING THE PLAN- AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT EVEN UPON PLAN APPROVAL AND WE HAVE APPROVED A PLANS. YEAH DOESN'T AND THE PROCESS THAT ACT BEGAN- THE PROCESS OF OUR CONTENT OVERSIGHT OF- IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PLAN SO YOU KNOW ONCE WE APPROVE THE PLAN AS ITS COMPLIANCE- BUT WE EXPECT PLANS TO ADAPT OVER TIME ON AND WE HAVE A NUMBER CORRECTIVE ACTIONS- FOR APPROVED. SO JUST BEGINS THE OVERSIGHT- WE ALSO HAVE A PROCESS FOR THE INITIAL REVIEW INCOMPLETE- WHICH REALLY IDENTIFIES A NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND DEFICIENCIES IN THOSE PLANS THAT WE HAVE FOR THOSE AGENCIES A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS SIX MONTHS TO CORRECT THOSE ARE AND IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO CORRECT THOSE CONSULTATION WITH OUR PARTNERS STATE BOARD WE CAN DEEM THE PLANTS AND ADEQUATE AND THEN IT'LL RESULT IN STATE BOARD EMPLOYEE- INTERVENTION- SO. WE RECOGNIZE- YOU KNOW FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY PLANS- YOU KNOW OUR OUR STANDARD WAS SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE- ARE THE REGULATIONS IN THE SCHOOLS. I THINK IT- VERY EASTSTRICT STANDARD WE WERE LOOKING AT ME- YOU KNOW IT- VERY- MINDFUL THAT WE WANT THESE LOCAL AGENCIES TO RETAIN LOCAL CONTROL AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINABILITY BUT THEY MUST DO IT UNDER A PLAN THAT IS COMPLIANT WITH THE LAW AND REGULATIONS. THOSE DEFICIENCIES ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THE NUMBER OF AGENCIES DID FIND THAT THEY ARE WORLD LOOKING TO ELIMINATE OVER DRAFTED IN TWENTY YEARS- BUT WE WANTED IT IS LAW CALLS FOR THEY MUST DO THAT IN A WAY THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE BENEFICIAL USES AND USES THE GROUNDWATER. AND THAT INCLUDES DOMESTIC WELL USERS- ARAB WILDWATER PREPARES- WETLANDS AND GROUNDWATER DEPENDENT ECOSYSTEMS- AND WHAT THEY NEED TO WORK OUT ITS. TWENTY YEARS. WHAT- I'M WAS ARE GOING TO. FIND WHAT BROUGH LEVEL SECTION STORAGE OF TITANS TO WATER QUALITY C. WATER INTRUSION INTO OF INTERCONNECT SERVICE WATERS ALL THESE SECTION. ABOUT WORKING BY DO WE ARE TO COMPLY WITH THE RAGS- BUT WE REALLY FOCUSED INITIALLY ON THIS DENTAL MANAGEMENT CRITERIA HAVE THEY- ADEQUATELY DETERMINED- WHETHER. IS SIGNIFICANT REASONABLE TAX ON ALL OF OUR USERS FROM THE SIX UNDESIRABLE RESULTS. SO WE WANTED TO- BESIDES THAT IDENTIFY WHETHER THEY USE THE BEST SCIENCE AND DATA- WHAT WAS REALLY THEIR PLAN TO MITIGATE OR ELIMINATE OVERDRAFT AND DO THEY HAVE A- ADEQUATE SUITE OF PROJECTS OF MANAGEMENT ACTIONS- THAT WOULD. LEAD AND IF I CHOOSE TO STAND ABILITY OVER TWENTY YEARS- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE INITIAL LIST OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT ACTIONS- MAYBE OUR PULLING IN AREAS PROJECTS NEED TO BE DEVELOPED FOR THE DEVELOPING ALLOCATION SCHEMES. AND SO ONE OF OUR CORRECTION ACTIONS AS WE DO WANT IT A PRETTY BROAD SUITE OF OUR CONTINGENCIES IN THE EVENT SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS MANAGEMENT ACTIONS- DOCTOR FOR WHICH- WE WILL ALSO IN. BY COMMENT- WE PUT OFFER PUBLIC COMMENT AS WELL AS PERIOD- WE DO REVIEW ALL THE COMMENTS WE'VE GOT OVER FIVE HUNDRED COMMENTS. FROM THE PUBLIC ON THE PLANS- AND MORE MORE THAN EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS. SO NOW I'M GOING TO SWITCH- AND TRIED TO THE CURRENT STATUS OF WHAT WAS BEING IMPLEMENTATION THAT'S NOT PLEASE. SO WE DID IT OUT OF THE TWENTY PLANS ARE SUBMITTED- WE DID APPROVED EIGHT PLANTS- AND THE MAP ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE I IDENTIFIES- THOSE BASINS WORK- AND AGAIN WE FOUND YOU KNOW EVEN WITH APPROVED PLANS NO PLAN IS PERFECT- WE DO RECOMMEND A NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS. ALL THE STAFF IN A MOMENT- AND THEN REALLY THE SUB SUB FOR THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND THOSE OTHER- FILE ITEMS WE IDENTIFIED- FOR OUR FULL REVIEW OUR FULL FIVE YEAR REVIEW WHICH IS A NOTHER COMPLIANCE CHECKPOINT. ARE TO DETERMINE ARE THEY ON TRACK OTHER YOU KNOW THAT PLAN IS COMPLIANT- BUT- THEY WALKING THE WALK THEY ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING AND TAKING THOSE ACTIONS ARE NEEDED TO REACH STAND ABILITY AND IT ANYTIME IF WE FIND AN AGENCY IS FAILING TOP LIVE. LIVE UP TO WHAT THEY HAVE PUT INTO THEIR PLAN OKAY NOT GOING TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY WE CAN GO BACK AND CALL THE PLAN AND ADEQUATE AND HAVE THE- RESULT IN. ORDER TO PENSION AND TELL THEY GET THEIR PLAN. AND THEIR ACTIONS BACK ON TRACK- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE TWELFTH PLANS THAT WE'RE GETTING- INCOMPLETE WE'RE BASED UPON NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES AND THEY NEED TO- CORRECT THOSE DEFICIENCIES- WITHIN A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. OUT ONE THING ON OUR- OUR REFUSES WE REVIEWED THE PLANS AS THEY WERE SUBMITTED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY A NUMBER OF THE AGENCIES SINCE TWENTY TWENTY IT- ADAPTED THEIR PLAN BASED UPON NEW INFORMATION HEARD GOTTEN- THE DATA. OR HAD TAKEN DIFFERENT APPROACHES- SO AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE- YEP SPOCK THE DEFICIENCIES WE EXPECT THAT THEY MAY BE PROVIDING US MORE UPDATED INFORMATION ON THE PLAN OR MANY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REDO OF THE APPROACH THAT TAKEN TO BE COMPLIANT- BROWN SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT EVEN THESE PLANTS THAT HAVE. BEEN DEEMED COMPLETE AND HAVE CERTAIN DEFICIENCIES MANY HAVE TAKEN CONSIDERABLE STEPS TO- TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY INCLUDING RECHARGE WATER SUPPLY AUGMENTATION AND- ALLOCATION REDUCTIONS TO REDUCE THE DEMAND ON THE BASIS. SO WE'RE EXPECTING THEM TO CONTINUE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THAT CORRECTING THE DEFICIENCIES IT MAY WE WANT THEM TO CONTINUE ON THAT PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY BUT IT MIGHT JUST CHANGE WHERE THE GOAL LINE IS THAT THEY NEED TO GET TO RESPECT BOTH OF THE CRITERIA. NOW I'D LIKE TO GO THROUGH. SO THAT MAKE IT OVER ARCHING ISSUES WITH PHOTOS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO SOME OF THE COMMON ERROR DEFICIENCIES- ONE WAS- SUBSIDENCE- AND THAT WAS COMMON IN A NUMBER OF BASINS AND THE ONE THING THAT SIGNAL DOES CALL FOR IS THE ELIMINATION OR MINIMIZATION OF SUBSIDES- NUMBER PLANS REDUCE FINE BASED UPON OUR REVIEW. I DID A LOT FOR CONTINUED SUBSIDENCE- AND ALSO DID NOT FULLY ADDRESS ALL THE GROUND WATER USES AND USES THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAY BE AFFECTED AND DESCRIBING THAT. WITH WATER QUALITY A NUMBER OF THE PLANS DID- RESULTED IN A AND IT'S ACTUALLY HELPING- WIND OR HUNDREDS OF WELLS THAT COULD BE DE WATERED- AND GO DRY UPON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLANT. NOW WHAT WE ARE. REQUIRED THEM TO DO IS TO- DO COOL THINGS IS EITHER COME BACK AND JUSTIFY HOW THEY FEEL THAT THAT IS NOT SIGNIFICAN AND REASONABLE SOMEONE'S WATER SUPPLY GOING DRY. GIVEN THE- A MANDATE ON HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER OR ALTERNATIVELY COME BACK AND- BUT IN MITIGATION MEASURES AND OTHER AUGMENTATION TO EITHER BE PROTECTIVE OF OUR DRINKING WATER SOURCES OR TO MITIGATE- WELLS GOING DRY NUMBER OF AGENCIES HAVE PROPOSED DOING THIS BUT A NUMBER OF ISSUES THEY DID NOT- WE FOUND THAT. ALSO PROMPTED US TO PUT OUT AND DEVELOP GUIDANCE- WHICH WE'RE LOOKING TO DO AND- WHAT THE NEXT STOP FOR SIX MONTHS OR SO GUIDANCE ON ON WATER QUALITY AND PROTECTION IN JACKET WATER- IN WATER QUALITY ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND- IS BASINS THAT ARE ARE GOING TO HELP THE CHRONICLE OF PATIENTS GLOBAL OF HISTORIC LOWS I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DESCRIBE TO KEEP CLOSER TRACK ON WHAT THAT IS GOING TO DO FOR WATER QUALITY ISSUES WITHIN THEIR BASE. SO WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR M. SCRIBE OR OVERSIGHT ON AND TRACKING OF WATER QUALITY DEPLETION OF INTERCONNECTED SURFACE WATERS THIS WAS A COMMON DATA GAP THIS IS A. AREA THAT IS NOT- READ ONLY FLUSHED OUT OF MATH. ARE IT'S CLEAR IMPORTANT AS MANY OF KNOW THE FIRST WATER GET TAKEN OF THE BASIN IS IF IT'S CONNECTED TO A SERVER WATER PUMP THE CREEK IN STRONG. THAT'S VERY FOR BROWN ONE ECOSYSTEMS AND AQUATIC- SPECIES SO- METHODOLOGY IS BEING DEVELOPED AND I'M BURKE AGENCIES JEWS ARE PROXIES OR GROUNDWATER LEVELS AS A PROXY. ENTERING THINGS DATA GAPS ARE FILLED WHICH- IS ALLOWABLE BUT WE WANT SPECIFIC MINIMUM THRESHOLD BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOR DEPLETION OF INTERCONNECTED. SURFACE WATER AND LASTLY A NUMBER OF PLANS HAD- LACK OF COORDINATION THEY HAD MULTIPLE PLANS WITHIN THE BASIN WHICH IS A LOT. BUT PROVIDED THEY NEED TO HAVE THE SAME DATA AND SAME METHODOLOGY AND WE FOUND THAT- THEY DID NOT SO THOSE ARE. OUR COMMUNICATIONS ARE ARE. CONTINUING- OTHER AREAS OF THE- IN THE THESE ARE THE MAIN ERROR THAT WOULD DESTROY THAT LED TO INCOMPLETE- BUT WE FOUND FOR ALL THE PLANS WE WANTED A BROADER SET OF CONTINGENCY FOR PROJECTS FOR THE FUTURE- WE WANTED OUR- CONTINUED GREATER TRANSPARENCY ON THAT PROCESS WITH THE PUBLIC- MORE DETAILS ON HOW THEY INTEND TO FILL DATA GAPS. IN AND AGAIN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT- IS SOMETHING THAT IS GONE YOUR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING TO- WORK WITH THE AGENCIES AND PROVIDE TOOLS AND GUIDANCE- TO IMPROVE THAT- AND THEN INTERFACE IN COORDINATION IS ALSO GOING TO BE ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE'RE GOING TO- TRACK AS WE GO THROUGH THOSE FIRST EARLY STAGES OF. THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND THIS ENSURES THAT ONE BASINS PLAN IS NOT GOING TO PRECLUDE ANOTHER JOHNNY GRAYSON FROM. NICHOLS AND LASTLY- WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE- DATA ON THE MOST OF YOUR CHANGE CONDITION THE STRAW WE HAVE THAT'S- THE MOST HISTORIC WENT YEAR FOLLOWING. THE BUT MAJOR DROP WE HAD. YOU KNOW THE PLANS- NO ONE REALLY WOULD PROTECT IT THIS TYPE OF HYDROLOGY DOUBLE CAB BUT IT'S THE REALITY AND IT'S THE FUTURE- SO WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING OVERTIME TO HAVING PLANS- ADDRESS IN AND BE ALMOST STRESS TEST TOWARDS THE MORE SEVERE DROUGHT AND CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS OVER EXPERIENCING SO. THAT MAY LEAD TO FURTHER ADOPTION OF THESE PLANS OVER TIME SO AT THE END OF THE DAY IN TWENTY YEARS. WE'RE GONNA EXPECT THESE PHARMACIST AND ABILITY PLANTS TO BE RESILIENT TOWARDS THE MOST SEVERE. DROUGHT CONDITIONS WE'RE GOING TO FACE. LIKE WITH. SO SOME GOOD NEWS ON. AND SOME MILESTONES- WE HAD TWENTY TWENTY PLAN SUBMITTED IN JANUARY SIXTY FIVE PLANES FROM- SIXTY THREE BASINS- WE HAD FIVE PLANS FROM ALL THAT WOULD VOLUNTARY LOW AND VERY LOW PRIORITY BASINS- WE ARE ALL POSTED FOR A SEVENTY FIVE DAY COMMENT PERIOD AND WE'RE BUT WE DO WHICH WE DON'T. ACCEPT COMMENTS AT ANY TIME WE HAVE A TWO YEAR CYCLE TO REVIEW THESE PLANS AND WORDS JUST INITIATING THAT PROCESS SO- WE WILL ACCEPT COMMENTS- AS CLOSE TO REACHING OUT FORMAL DETERMINATION ON THESE PLANTS ARE. EXCELLENT WITH FOR THE PLANS- YOU KNOW THE NEXT STEP FOR GSA'S THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO PLANS AGAIN- WAS SUBMITTED AND EIGHT ARE. ACCEPTED AND AGAIN THEY WERE JUST BEGINNING THE PROCESS OF CONTINUING DOWN THAT PLOWED PATH WILL BE- PROVIDING OVERSIGHT AND WE DO HAVE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS- AND FOR THE PLANS THAT ARE INCOMPLETE THEY'RE THEY'RE ON THE CLOCK FOR A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. TO OUR RESOLVE THE DEFICIENCIES- WE'RE CONSULTING WITH THEM- TO EXPLAIN WHAT WE FOUND- I BY THE END OF. IT'S GOING TO BE A BINARY JUST IF THEY DO NOT GET THEIR- UPDATED PLAN INTO US- OR IF WE REVIEW WHAT THEY SUBMITTED AND FINED IF THEY FAIL TO ADDRESS ALL THE DEFICIENCIES- THAT WILL RESULT IN US DEEMING THE PLAN INADEQUATE AND RESULT IN STATE BOARD- INTERVENTION. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A SIXTY DAY COMMENT PERIOD FOR THE PLANS THAT ARE- AMENDED PLANS OF THE SUBMITTED AND THEN IN JANUARY TOOL FOR THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT. ON THAT ALSO- AND AGAIN FOR BONTA BASIN PLAN'S GONNA NEED TO ALL THE- COORDINATOR AND UPDATED WITH THE BOARD OF WORKING RELATIONSHIP IS ARE. WORKING VERY WELL AND- BURKE TREES WITHOUT. WITH THE STATE BOARD. ARE WE ARE EXPECTING ALL THE PLANS TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR ANNUAL REPORTS EVEN THE PLANTS OF THE SUBMITTED IN JANUARY AB PEOPLE FIRST ALL I'M JUST THERE AND FIRST IN RIVER. WILL GIVE CLOSE AT FIVE YEAR UPDATE- IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW OUR SYSTEMS AND THE. INVESTMENTS THAT ARE MADE OF. SHE WAS THESE AGENCIES ARE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE. OUR A LOT OF THE AGENCY TO ARE WHO. ARE AND THEY'RE NEW TO WHY MANAGEMENT OR- STILL. GOING TO SOME. GROWING PAINS FUNDING AND THAT JUSTIN. TO LOOKING INTO AGENCY- AND SO IS WHY IS. VERY IMPORTANT BUT WE ARE GOING TO GROW THAT THESE. WHAT HOW THEY CONDUCT SO. THERE TATIAN IS TO BECOME EVERYCHOICE TO STAND- THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF OUR WATER USES AND USERS- SO WITH THAT OUR NEXT LOVE. THANK YOU- I LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY CHANCE YOUR QUESTION MUCH FOR THAT OVERVIEW INCREDIBLY HELPFUL WILL MOVE TO JAMES KNOCK OUR DIRECTOR OF OFFICE OF RESEARCH PLANNING AND PERFORMANCE AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. CAME TO THEIR- YES GOOD MORNING- THANKS I HAVE A SINCE IT LOOKS LIKE I'VE GOT SHARON ACCIDENTS IT WOULD GO. SO GOOD MORNING THE SHARES OF VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM JAMES KNOCK POWER THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH PLANNING AND PERFORMANCE FOR THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD I'M HAPPY TO BE FOLLOWING DUE TO BE ARE HERE- I WILL BE JOINED SHORTLY BY TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES- NATALIE STARK CONTAMINATED I'LL START BY GIVING OUT. AN OVERVIEW- SO IN SIGNAL THE STATE ROLE IS LIMITED BUT IT IS CLEAR- ACID SAYS THE ACT WHERE LOCAL OR LOCAL GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY IS NOT MANAGING ITS GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABLY THE STATE NEEDS TO PROTECT THE RESOURCE UNTIL A LOCAL GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY. CAN SUSTAINABLY MANAGE THE GROUNDWATER BASIN. AND THIS IS A GREAT TIME FOR THIS HEARING IT COMES AT A REALLY GOOD TIME BECAUSE WE ARE AT THIS POINT OF TRANSITION POTENTIALLY- FROM THE DEPARTMENT- MAKING ITS DETERMINATIONS TO THE STATE BOARD CONSIDERING- FURTHER ACTIONS. BUT I DO WANT TO LOOK BACK A LITTLE BIT WHAT WE AT THE STATE WATER BOARD HAVE BEEN DOING TO DATE UNDER CIGNA- AND SHOWN HERE ON THE SLIDE WE'VE BEEN SUPPORTING THESE LOCAL GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES AND A NUMBER OF WAYS. YES THEY HAVE BEEN CREATING THERE ARE LOCAL PLANS WHICH ARE REALLY REALLY COMPLICATED IN MANY CASES- THE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THEY NEED TO TRACK. I'M WATER CONDITIONS- THE LOCAL NEEDS- THE FUTURE CONDITIONS THEY'D LIKE TO ATTAIN. AND THEY ALSO NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE VARIOUS PROJECTS FOR MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES THEY CAN CONSIDER WHAT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. SO THESE PLANS ARE REALLY DETAILED AND REALLY COMPLICATED. WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- WE'VE BEEN. GIVING INFORMATIVE PRESENTATIONS AND CREATING FACT SHEETS WE'VE ALSO SUPPORTED A FACILITATION- GET A COUPLE BASINS. INCLUDING THE ST LOUIS RAY AND SIERRA VALLEY BASINS. WE'VE ALSO BEEN CONSULTING WITH T. W. R. THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS- HANNAN'S PROVIDING. YOU KNOW JUST PERSPECTIVES AND THAT. HAS TAKEN ON THE ROLE- THE TAKEN ON THE FORM AND SOME CASES OF FORMAL COMMENT LETTERS FROM THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. THAT WE PROVIDED TWELVE COMMENT LETTERS TO THIS POINT- IN THESE ARE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON TOPICS WITHIN THEWATER BOARD'S- JURISDICTION INCLUDING DRINKING WATER ISSUES WATER QUALITY ISSUES ISSUES OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN. SURFACE WATERS LIKE WETLANDS. AND GROUNDWATER. AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE'VE BEEN TO THIS POINT AND WE ARE NOW POTENTIALLY AT A TRANSITION POINT WHERE WE MAY BE MOVING INTO- WHAT'S CALLED STATE INTERVENTION STATE INTERVENTION UNDER SIGNAL HAS TWO PHASES. IS A LARGE CIRCLES HERE ON THE SLIDE A BASIN CAN BE PUT ON PROBATION OR- AND MAYBE LATER A BASIN CAN BE MADE SUBJECT TO AN INTERIM PLAN DEVELOPED BY THE STATE WATER BOARD. EACH OF THOSE TWO PHASES OF INTERVENTION- CAN ONLY OCCUR FOLLOWING A DECISION BY THE STATE WATER BOARD BOB STANFORD IN THE FIRST CASE STILL BE EVALUATING AND CONSIDERING IF INTERVENTION IS WARRANTED- AND IN THE SECOND CASE BEFORE AN INTERIM PLAN IS DEVELOPED- AND IMPOSED THE WATER BOARD WILL BE CONSIDERING IF THE ISSUES- IN THE BASIN HAVE BEEN FIXED. OR NOT. AND NOW I WILL- HIM THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE NATALIE STARK. OKAY THANK YOU JAMES HI MY NAME IS NATALIE STARK I'M A SENIOR ENGINEERING GEOLOGIST IN THE STATE WATER BOARDS GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH FUNDING AND PERFORMANCE. NOW THAT WE'VE HAD A BIT OF A SUMMARY OF STATE INTERVENTION. I'M GOING TO DIVE IN AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. AND THE PROCESS FOR MOVING TOWARDS A PROBATIONARY DETERMINATION. SO WHERE WE ARE TODAY IS IN THIS FIRST BOX HERE THIS TIME TO CURE PERIOD. THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES HAS DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL PLANS ARE INCOMPLETE. NOW LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS TO FIX THE ISSUES WITH THE PLANS. AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD D. W. R. WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION. ARE THE PLANS ADEQUATE OR INADEQUATE PLANS ARE INADEQUATE THE BOARD WILL ASSESS THE DEFICIENCIES AND DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS WARRANTED TO MOVE TOWARDS A PROBATIONARY HEARING. IF THE BOARD DECIDES TO MOVE TOWARDS A HEARING. THE PORT HAS NOTICING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THE STATUTE. THE BOARD HAS TO PROVIDE NINETY DAYS OF NOTICE TO CITIES COUNTIES AND GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES TO NOTIFY THEM OF THE HEARING. THE BOARD ALSO HAS TO PROVIDE SIXTY DAYS OF NOTICE TO ALL OF THE KNOWN AND- EXPECTED GROUNDWATER PUMPERS IN THE GROUNDWATER BASIN WATER MORE PUBLIC MEETINGS TO REACH OUT TO STAKEHOLDERS AND INTERESTED PARTIES TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT A PROBATIONARY DETERMINATION COULD MEAN FOR THE BASIN. BAND THE PORTAL TO HEARING AND DECIDES WHETHER OR NOT TO ADOPT AN ORDER DECLARING THAT THE SECRETARY. IF THE BOARD PUTS THE BASE ON PROBATION. TSA'S HAVE ONE YEAR TO ADD SORRY IF THE BOARD- PUTS THE BASIN ON PROBATION. I'M THERE'S AT LEAST ONE YEAR BEFORE THE STATE WATER BOARD CAN DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT AN INTERIM PLAN AND THE LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE TIME TO WORK ON FIXING THOSE ISSUES THAT. BUT THE BASE ON PROBATION. THE WHOLE TIME WILL BE CLOSELY COORDINATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES SINCE THE GOAL IS FOR BASS AND STICK IT BACK ON THE D. W. R. TRACK. EXCITED PLEASE. SO NOW THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW. WE'VE MOVED TOWARDS A PROBATIONARY DETERMINATION IF IT IS WARRANTED I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR BASS AND TO BE ON PROBATION. THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE BOARD. AFTER THE DETERMINATION WOULD IDENTIFY THE DEFICIENCIES THAT RESULTED IN THE BASIN BEING PUT ON PROBATION AND TRACK THE PROGRESS OF LOCAL AGENCIES AS THEY WORK TO FIX THOSE ISSUES. SINCE THE BOARD HAS TO WAIT AT LEAST ONE YEAR BEFORE DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING AN INTERIM PLAN THIS PROVIDES TIME FOR AGENCIES TO WORK TO ADDRESS THOSE DEFICIENCIES. IN CASE THE BOARD NEEDS TO DEVELOP ITS OWN PLAN- AN INTERIM PLAN THE BOARD NEEDS TO COLLECT DATA AND INFORMATION SO THAT IT'S ABLE TO DO SO AS SUCH THE BOARD WILL REQUIRE REPORTING. AND MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF INVESTIGATIONS. IN ORDER TO COLLECT ACCURATE DATA THE BOARD MAY REQUIRE METERS. AND THE STATUTE REQUIRES THE BOARD TO RECOVER THE COST OF THE PROGRAM AND SO ANYONE WHO IS REQUIRED TO REPORT THEIR GROUNDWATER EXTRACTIONS THE BOARD WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO PAY A FEE. I WANT TO ADD IN HERE THAT. AT ANY TIME IF THE LOCAL AGENCIES ARE ABLE TO FIX THE ISSUES THAT RESULTED IN THE BASIN BEING PUT ON PROBATION. THEY CAN PETITION THE BOARD AND THE STATE INTERVENTION PROCESS. WE DON'T WANT TO PUT ANY BASINS ON PROBATION OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE LOCAL AGENCIES BE SUCCESSFUL AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING TOWARDS THE ENTIRE TIME INCLUDING INFORMATION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO FAR WE STEP THROUGH WHAT IT MEANS TO. HEADWORDS PROBATION TO BE PUT ON PROBATION- AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IF ISSUES AREN'T FIXED DURING THAT PERIOD WHAT SENATE TERM PLAN. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. YOU'RE A FREAK FEW BRIEF DETAILS PLAN AS CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IN THOSE ARE TO GET THE BASIN BACK ON TRACK AN INTERIM PLAN WILL ALSO INCLUDE MONITORING TO MEASURE HOW THOSE ACTIONS ARE WORKING. SCHEDULE FOR THE ACTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE THE PLAN IS FOLLOWED. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THAT AN INTERN PLAN IT'S TEMPORARY IT'S NOT MEANT TO REPLACE THE GST- IT'S MEANT TO GET THE BASE AND BACK ON TRACK TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY WELL GSA'S FIX THE ISSUES AND THEIR GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS SO THAT MANAGEMENT OF THE BASE AND CAN BE HANDED BACK. TO LOCAL AGENCIES. THAT WRAPS UP MY SUMMARY OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITH STATE INTERVENTION- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE AT AN INTERESTING SIDE NOTE IS THAT THE SEVERAL BASINS I HAVE RECENTLY MOVED TOWARDS COMPREHENSIVE ADJUDICATIONS AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAND IT OFF TO TINA CANNON LAZY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ADJUDICATION PROCESS. AND IN LINE WITH THE STREAMLINED EDUCATION ACT. SO GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE IN FRONT OF YOU IT'S A LITTLE BIT INTERESTING FOR ME SINCE I WAS THE PRINCIPAL CONSULTANT FOR WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE. DURING THE TIME THAT WE WERE DRAFTING SICKNESS AND I FIND MYSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VIRTUAL TABLE BUT IT'S VERY NICE TO BE HERE- SO I'M JUST GOING TO. ADDRESS WOULD YOU TO CATIONS VERY QUICKLY SO THAT'S HOW WE CAN MOVE TO ANY QUESTIONS. SO EDUCATION IS A COMPREHENSIVE IT'S LIKE WHEN A COURT DOES A COMPREHENSIVE DETERMINATION OF ALL OF THEIR RIGHTS EITHER STREAM WATER SYSTEM OR INTO GROUNDWATER BASIN SO THAT SENATE JUDICATA. ANNA SENATOR PROBABLY MENTIONED YOU KNOW THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY WORK VERY CLOSELY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIGMA AND FOLLOWING SIGNAL THE NEXT YEAR SENATOR PROBABLY WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE SAME REMEMBER LITTLE LISTEN LATE HOW IN ORDER TO- MAKE SURE THAT. ADJUDICATIONS WERE INTEGRATED WITH CIGNA THERE WERE STREAMLINED- PROVISIONS IN THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE FOR ADJUDICATIONS AND SO CURRENTLY WHAT WE HAVE IS WHAT WE CALL THIS COURT AFTER SUSTAINABILITY. SO IT REQUIRES THAT COURTS. IN CONDUCTING GROUNDWATER ADJUDICATIONS ARE COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT IT'S A BASIN IS SOMETHING IS SUBJECT TO STIGMA IS A HIGH OR MEDIUM PRIORITY BASIN SUBJECT TO CIGNA THE DATA JUDICATA IS NOT SUPPOSED TO INTERFERE WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE SUSTAINABILITY CALL THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE BOTTOM LINE. AND IT DOES NOT IN VARIOUS WAYS THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS NOTIFIED THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY- THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES REFUSE ANY FINAL ADJUDICATION THE COURT CAN ASK THE STATE WATER BOARD IN VARIOUS WAYS TO ASSIST IT EITHER IT COULD REFERENCE SOMETHING OVER TO THE STATE WATER BOARD OR IT CAN ASK FOR ASSISTANCE. FOR EXAMPLE AND I'M BRINGING EXPERTISE TO THE EDUCATION. SO THE COURT CAN ALL JUDGMENT SO OAK IS ABLE. SORT OF SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT THE BOARD PERHAPS IN IMPLEMENTING AN INTERN PLAN. MIGHT TO RESTRICT SMOKING THE COURT IS ABLE TO PREVENT ANY NEW- WELLS OR CAMPING OR TO LIMIT EXISTING WELLS AND PUMPING. SO THERE'S REMEDIES WITHIN THAT STREAMLINED EDUCATION STATUTE FOR THE COURT. TO LIMIT PUMPING AND AS I SAID THERE'S VARIOUS CROSSOVERS BETWEEN THE COURT PROCESS AND THE SIGNAL PROCESS. SO I KNOW THAT WAS KIND OF A BRIEF THE FLY OVER BUT WITHOUT I'LL LEAVE IT FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH INCREDIBLY HELPFUL A PRESENTATION AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO OUR WITNESSES THAT ARE HERE WITH US IN THE ROOM SO WILL INVITE AND- ALLEN. HEY NICK AND OVER S. B. ABOU I GOT THAT RIGHT APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA TO JOIN US. TRYING THIS OUT FOR THIS IS THE FIRST FIRST TIME THE BUILDING IN TWO YEARS. GOOD MORNING WE LOVE BACK THE CHANCE CHANCE TO SEE YOU ALL IN THREE D. WAS WAS TOO MUCH. TO RESIST. SO A GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRS NOT VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I'M ELLEN HANNEKE I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE WATER POLICY CENTER AT THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'M HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE OF OURS GREW ABOUT WHO IS A SENIOR FELLOW. AT PPA C. AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT ARE. THE SOME OF THE BASES THAT ARE ON THAT LIST OF INCOMPLETE. THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT FROM. THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IN THIS IS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON. ISSUES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WHICH ARGUABLY IS. SORT OF THE PLACE THAT. REALLY MOTIVATED SEGMENT TO BE ADOPTED IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THIS WAS BACK DURING THE LAST DROUGHT A LOT OF ISSUES THERE WITH. LONG TERM OVERDRAFT BUT THEN REALLY ACCELERATED PUMPING LEADING TO ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS SO WHAT I'M GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE FOR YOU IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERVIEW ON. SOME OF THE BIG ISSUES IN TERMS OF WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THE OVERDRAFT PROBLEM THERE. A BIT ON SOME OF THE ON GOING CHALLENGES. AND SOME. IDEAS FOR WHAT THE STATE CAN DO AT THIS POINT TO REALLY SUPPORT THE LOCAL PROCESS SO. WITH THAT I JUST ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS WORK THAT'S BEEN. COLLABORATION OF A LOT OF FOLKS FROM. ACROSS THE STATE AND MANY VALLEY STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN. INVOLVED IN IN PROVIDING INPUT ON ON OUR RESEARCH OVER THE- PAST FIVE SEVEN YEARS. SO WITH THAT PLEASE NEXT SLIDE. SO YOU'VE HEARD ALL ABOUT SIGNAL ALREADY WHAT I JUST WANTED TO. HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU HERE IS THAT LAST LITTLE BIT WHICH IS. THIS IDEA OF YOU KNOW ARE WE MOVING FAST ENOUGH AND SHOULD SET THE PACE BE PICKED UP AND I THINK. THE KEY ISSUE THERE IS THAT SAME AS KIND OF A BALANCING ACT IT DOES PROVIDE A FLEXIBLE TIMELINE. IT DOESN'T SAY OVER BREATH TEST AND TOMORROW. YOU KNOW YOU SUBMIT YOUR PLANS THEN GOT TWENTY YEARS TO GET TO FULL SUSTAINABILITY BUT THERE ARE GUARDRAILS. AND THIS IS THE KEY THING NOW WHEN YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT. ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT UNREASONABLE UNDESIRABLE RESULTS THAT YOU HAVE TWENTY YEARS TO GET THERE BUT IF YOU'RE CAUSING SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS ALONG THE WAY. YOU'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THOSE. IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN'T WAIT TWENTY YEARS TO ADDRESS THOSE SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A KEY THING AND WHAT YOU SAW FROM THE W. OURS REVIEW. AND IT'S GOING TO BE I'M SURE A KEY ISSUE FOR THE STATE BOARD TOO. SO NEXT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A- KIND OF HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU OF. THE ISSUES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WHICH ARE KIND OF CIRCLE THERE WITH THAT. WHITE WHITE OBLONG- AREA YOU CAN SEE MOST OF THAT REGION IS COLORED ORANGE THAT'S BECAUSE THOSE OF THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASIN SO MOST OF THESE BASINS DID HAVE TO SUBMIT PLANS BY. JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. IN ALL THERE WERE ELEVEN THAT WERE SUBMITTED OR ELEVEN BASINS THAT HAD TO SUBMIT PLANS- THIS WAS. IT THIS IS A BIG DEAL THIS IS THE OF THE STATE'S BIGGEST AGRICULTURAL REGION OVER HALF OF ALL AGRICULTURE OUTPUT MISSION DOLLARS. COMES FROM THIS REGION- AND IT'S A IT'S A BIG OVERDRAFT IT'S ABOUT TWO MILLION ACRE FEET WE ESTIMATE OF ANNUAL AVERAGE OVERDRAFT WHICH IS ABOUT 11% OF. OF NET WATER USE ON AVERAGE MOST OF THIS IS AGRICULTURE ABOUT 90% IS AGRICULTURE BECAUSE OF THE REALLY BIG IMPORTANCE OF YOUR GATED AGRICULTURE IN THIS REGION. SO CONSEQUENCES THAT WE SAW BIG TIME IN THE LAST ROW AND WE'RE SEEING AGAIN IN THIS DROUGHT. DRY WELLS THIS INCLUDES A LOT OF DRINKING WATER WELLS DOMESTIC WELL SMALL COMMUNITY WELLS BUT ALSO ACT WELLS- SINKING LANDS YOU HEARD ABOUT SUBSIDENCE. IT'S BEEN A LONG TERM ISSUE BUT IT IT GETS WORSE WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF PUMPING. AND THAT THAT CELEBRATES DURING TRIPS. AND THEN JUST THREATS TO THE LONG TERM AVAILABILITY OF THAT A REALLY IMPORTANT DROUGHT RESOURCE WHICH IS THE GROUND WATER RESERVES GROUNDWATER RESERVES. THAT THAT PEOPLE USE WHEN THERE ISN'T SURFACE WATER AVAILABLE SO. DEALING WITH THIS AND KIND OF SOLVING IS SOLVING THIS PROBLEM IS. A COMBINATION YOU HAVE TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT THREE PIECES OF THIS PUZZLE THE FIRST IS THE GROUNDWATER MATH PROBLEM AND THAT IS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT LONG TERM OVERDRAFT. YOU GOT IT FIXED THE BALANCE BY EITHER ADDING SUPPLIES. REDUCING PUMPING REDUCING DEMAND OR SOME COMBINATION. AND THEN THE COMES THE SOCIO ECONOMIC PROBLEM WHICH IS THAT. SOME SOLUTIONS ARE MORE COSTLY THAN OTHERS AND YOU REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHICH COMBINATION WHICH PORTFOLIO OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND SOLUTIONS. IS GOING TO BE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE FOR THE REGION AND THIS IS THINKING ABOUT THE GROWERS THEMSELVES AND THEIR BOTTOM LINE BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW THE JOBS THAT THAT AGRICULTURE GENERATES AND SORT OF THE OVERALL PACKAGE FOR THE FOR THE ECONOMY. SO WE DID AN ANALYSIS ON THIS AND WE FOUND THAT BASICALLY FOR THIS REGION AS A WHOLE- ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE DEFICIT IS GOING TO BE NEEDS MET BE MET THROUGH DEMAND MANAGEMENT. WHICH BASICALLY MEANS TAKING. TAKING LAND OUT OF PRODUCTION AND THAT'S A BIG THE HARD THING AND THAT'S- PART OF THE REASON YOU'RE SEEING CHALLENGES IN. IN SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PLANS SO FAR. THE THIRD ISSUE A THIRD PROBLEM. AND THAT KIND OF RELATES TO ALL OF THIS AND HOW YOU PUT TOGETHER IS THE GOVERNANCE CHALLENGE. THESE ARE BIG BASS SINCE THEY'RE NOT TINY BASINS THERE'S A LOT OF DIVERSITY. IN THE CONDITIONS THERE AND THAT REALLY MAKES. PUTTING THIS PACKAGE TOGETHER HARD AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF REALLY GREAT WORK DONE. TO IT TO TRY TO TRY TO PULL THIS TOGETHER SO WHAT WAS WHAT WAS SUBMITTED INTO JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. WAS ALREADY. YOU KNOW A MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT RELATIVE TO WHERE WE WERE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN THIS LAW WAS PASSED. THAT IS NOT TO GIVE PEOPLE A PASS BUT IT'S JUST TO SAY. IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SITTING ON YOU KNOW BUT NOT DOING ANYTHING THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF HARD WORK. SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I WANT TO GIVE YOU JUST THIS MAP WE'RE NOT GOING TO DRILL INTO IT BUT IT JUST GIVES YOU A SENSE. OF THE COMPLEXITY OF. MANAGING ORGANIZING ACCORDING ON WATER IN THE SPACES SO THIS IS ALL OF THE- THE BASINS ON THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FLOOR. AND THE- THE ONE FOR THIS TO YOUR- I NEVER GET RIGHT AND LEFT RIGHT THE ONE THIS IS IRRIGATED CROPLAND. ON TOP THERE THAT'S GOT ALL THOSE COLORS THOSE DIFFERENT COLORS ARE. HOW MUCH AVERAGE HOW MUCH ON AVERAGE OR SURFACE WATER AVAILABLE FOR. IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE. IF IT'S QUITE BLUE THAT MEANS THERE'S GENERALLY ENOUGH THAT YOU DON'T YOU GROUND WATER. IF IT'S DARK RED IT MEANS YOU'RE ALWAYS USING GROUND WATER AND THAT'S ALL YOU'RE USING. AND IF IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN IT'S CEMEX AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE SOME YOU KNOW SOME SOME COMBINATION OF THE TWO OR MORE GROUND WATER IN DROUGHT YEARS. AND THE OTHER MAPS TO SHOW YOU THE MIX BETWEEN PERENNIALS AND ANNUALS BUT THE KEY ISSUE I THINK THAT. THAT THIS HIGHLIGHTS IS THAT. EVEN WITHIN BASINS WITHIN MOST BASINS THERE'S A LOT OF DIVERSITY. AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT SEEING PEOPLE ALL COMING TOGETHER IN ONE SINGLE AGENCY TO DO THIS PLANNING WITHIN THE BASES BECAUSE- THEY THEY'RE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS AND KIND OF FIGURING THAT OUT. HAS BEEN HARD FOR THEM AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS JUST ACROSS BASINS. THERE'S A LOT OF DIVERSITY TO AND WATER MOVES AROUND. AND SO THERE'S POTENTIAL THERE FOR THINKING ABOUT ABOUT THIS NOT JUST AS A BASE AND- BUT AS A REGION OKAY NEXT NEXT I PLEASE- THIS ONE I DON'T I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THIS BUT- IT'S JUST A WAY TO GIVE YOU A VISUAL. ON ON THE- SORRY. SPEAKING THROUGH A MASK IS IT IS AN EXPERIENCE THAT I'M NOT USED TO IT- WHAT WHAT. WHAT WHAT WHAT THIS SHOWS YOU IS A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THAT WE DID ON THIS QUESTION OF SORT OF RECONCILING GROUNDWATER MATH AND SO ON THE SOCIOECONOMIC PROBLEM THIS IS WORK LED BY BY ALL OVER AND A COLLEAGUE AT UC MERCED A PROFESSOR WHO'S WITH WHO'S IT BECAUSE WAY MEDINA SWARA AND WHAT WHAT THIS LOOKS THAT IS DIFFERENT SCENARIOS FOR MANAGING DEMAND AND SUPPLY AND WHAT IT BASICALLY SHOWS YOU IS YOU'VE GOT CROP REVENUES YOU'VE GOT LOCAL REGIONAL FARM GDP FARM RELATED GDP THAT BECAUSE ALL THE PROCESSING. DOWNSTREAMOF AGRICULTURE AS WELL FARM RELATED JOBS AGAIN DEALT WITH INCLUDING OF ON FARM IN DOWNSTREAM AND THEN LAND FOLLOWING AND THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS LOOK AT OKAY HOW CAN YOU MANAGE THIS DEMAND IN WAYS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS COSTLY FOR THE REGIONAL ECONOMY AND WHAT IT SHOWS IS BASICALLY THOSE HIGH BAR THE HIGHEST BARS OF THE BROWN THOSE ARE IF EVERYTHING IS DONE IN A REALLY INFLEXIBLE WAY WHERE EVERYBODY'S JUST TOLD. YOU ALL CUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE AND NO MATTER WHAT CROPS YOU'RE GROWING WHETHER IT'S HIGH VALUE OR LOW VALUE ALL OF THOSE THINGS THE ORANGE AND THE YELLOW ALLOW MORE TRADING WATER BOOKS GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER WITHIN THE BASIN AND THEN THE YELLOW IS EVEN WITHIN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY MORE PROBABLY NOT GROUNDWATER BUT SURFACE WATER MOVING AROUND. THE LAST ONE THE GREEN IS IF YOU ALSO ADD IN THE COST EFFECTIVE SUPPLIES THAT WE ESTIMATE OUR EARTH ARE WORTH ARE OF A VALUE THAT FARMERS WILL BE WILLING TO PAY FOR AND STILL MAKE IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TERMS THEIR CROP BUSINESS THAT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW ABOUT. HALF A MILLION HALF A MILLION ACRE FEET. WHAT YOU SEE THAT THE- WE DOWN WITH THESE COMBINATION OF SOLUTIONS AND SO THIS IS WHERE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THING ABOUT HOW PEOPLE COOPERATE. AND MANAGE DEMAND IN WAYS THAT ARE FLEXIBLE- AND THAT INCLUDES HAVING ALLOCATIONS AND AN ABILITY TO TRADE WATER. SO LET'S GO AHEAD. TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE SO W. OURS REVIEWS I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO DETAIL BUT JUST YOU KNOW I WANT TO APPLAUD THEM THAT THEY TOOK A BASIN LEVEL. PERSPECTIVE ON THIS RATHER THAN JUST LOOKING AT EACH INDIVIDUAL PLAN- INDIVIDUALLY THEY REALLY TRIED TO LOOK AT THE- AT THE HOLD COORDINATOR HOLE THEY EMPHASIZE THINGS THAT A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS AND HAD POINTED OUT IN THEIR REVIEWS ABOUT THE UNDESIRABLE RESULTS. LIKE IMPACTS ON DRINKING WATER IMPACTS ON SUBSIDENCE AND THE OTHERS THAT PAUL MENTIONED TO YOU. AND THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT'S THOSE GUARDRAILS. THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR SIGMA TO WORK IN THE MEANTIME NOT JUST IN TWENTY FORTY. AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY ALSO HIGHLIGHTED ISSUES AROUND COORDINATION CHALLENGES MAY ALSO HOW TO HIGHLIGHT ISSUES OR ON SOME PLANS. NOT REALLY ADDRESSING THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND MANAGEMENT OPTIONS THAT COULD GET TO SUSTAINABILITY SO NEXT SLIDE. PLEASE AS THE WEED WE DID A DETAILED REVIEW OF THE PLANS FOR SOME THINGS BACK WHEN THEY WERE SUBMITTED IN TWENTY TWENTY AND OUR OUR WORK KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS SOME ADDITIONAL ISSUES THAT ARE KIND OF WHO IS STEPPING BACK FROM INDIVIDUAL PLANS A LOOKING AT THE REGION AND HOW IT ALL FITS TOGETHER AND WHAT WE WHAT WE FOUND WERE UP A COUPLE OF THINGS WHERE THE PLANS WERE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC A NUMBER OF THEM. DO THEIR GROUNDWATER MATH AND THEIR ESTIMATE THEIR OVERDRAFT BUT THEY USE YEARS. THAT DON'T REALLY GIVE YOU ENOUGH DRY YEARS. IN IN YOUR HISTORICAL AVERAGE SO THERE IF IT COULD SAY THAT THERE THE BALANCES THAT THEY SAY THEY NEED TO. TO FIX OUR LOW COMPARED TO COMPARED TO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE LAST DROUGHT. THE SECOND THING IS THAT IF YOU ADD UP ALL OF THE SUPPLY OPTIONS. THAT THE PLANS PROPOSED. YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE TIMES MORE WATER THAN IS AVAILABLE PEOPLE ARE MAKE ANY INDIVIDUAL PROJECT MIGHT BE FIN. BUT WHEN YOU ADD THEM UP FOLKS ARE COMPETING FOR THE SAME DROP THE WATER. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THESE PLANS ARE MADE LOCALLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING AT THEIR NEIGHBOR IN THE OTHER PLANNING AREA TO SEE- THAT THEY WANT THAT WATER TOO. SO THERE'S A REAL CHALLENGE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO ALL WORK OUT FOR FOLKS IN TERMS OF. YOUR ON THE KINGS RIVER FOR EXAMPLE EVERYBODY WANTS THE SAME WATER MULTIPLE TIMES. HEY YOU ARE THIS UP YOU WE ESTIMATE FOR RECHARGE WHAT REACH GROUNDWATER RECHARGE IS A REALLY IMPORTANT SOLUTION WE ESTIMATE THOUGH THAT THERE'S PROBABLY TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE. DESIRE FOR RECHARGE AND THERE IS WATER FOR RECHARGE AND SPACE AND- SO ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS GETS TO THE KIND OF TOO LITTLE EMPHASIS IS ON MANAGING DEMAND. WE'RE IN UNDERSTANDABLY THE PLANTS HAVEN'T WANTED TO GO HARD ON THAT IN THE BEGINNING BUT THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO GO MORE AND QUICKER AND- THIS YOU KNOW THE LAST POINT IS ESPECIALLY. GIVEN THAT IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE DRIER AND HOTTER THAN. THAN THE HISTORICAL AVERAGES WHICH IS WHAT THE PLANS FOCUSED ON SO WITH THAT I GUESS- WE WILL GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE AND YOU YOU KNOW WE'RE BACK IN DROUGHT- THIS MEANS. FEWER OPPORTUNITIES FOR RECHARGE WHICH IS THE SUPPLY SIDE. FULLER PUMPING MORE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE SURFACE WATER AND THAT'S LEADING TO MORE THESE UNDESIRABLE RESULTS SO IT'S REALLY PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON THAT ON THOSE GUARD RAILS THIS IS SOME ESTIMATES THE AUBURN ANOTHER COLLEAGUE DR RICH PALU. DID ON WELLS THAT ARE LIKELY TO GO DRY IF THIS COMING YEARS IS ALSO DRY AND VISITED A DOMESTIC WELL SO YOU KNOW IT'S A HUMAN ISSUE FOR COMMUNITIES. THAT THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HERE. OKAY NEXT SLIDE. FINAL ONE FOR YOU. FIVE AREAS WHERE WE THINK THAT THE STATE COULD REALLY BE HELPFUL HERE- THE FIRST IS YOU KNOW ADDRESSING. REALLY REALLY ENCOURAGING PUSHING. OF ENTICING LOCALS TO REALLY ADDRESS THE- THE UNDESIRABLE RESULTS OF OVERDRAFT AND FOR THIS THE KEY ACTION IS TO USE THE USE THE REGULATORY PROCESS THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN INTO THE LAW. AND I THINK YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE YOUR HAS HAS MADE THAT. MADE THAT CLEAR NOW IN THEIR REVIEWS AND THIS IS THIS IS AN AREA WHERE IT DOESN'T DO THE GUARDRAILS THAT NEED TO BE. ADDRESSED THEIR WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE CAN ALSO PROVIDE A SUPPORT. FOR AGENCIES THAT ARE THEY WANT TO REALLY DO THIS BUT THIS IS SORT OF THE- YOU KNOW. THIS THIS IS WHERE YOU YOU CAN'T GIVE YOU CAN'T GIVE THE ENTITIES A PASS ON THIS YOU HAVE TO HOLD HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. THE SECOND ONE IS PROMOTING ACCELERATION OF DEMAND MANAGEMENT. AND THIS IS WHERE I WOULD SAY I DON'T THINK THAT THE SIGMA TIME LINES. NEED TO BE SHORTENED. BUT I THINK THAT THIS MEASURABLE PROGRESS ALONG THE WAY AND- DEALING WITH THE GUARDRAILS OF NOT CAUSING THE UNDESIRABLE RESULTS. MEANS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE FASTER ON THE DEMAND SIDE. THAN THE THAN FOLKS WERE HOPING IT HAD WE BEEN FIVE YEARS OF WET RECHARGE YEARS WE MIGHT HAVE HAD A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW. BUT IT'S DRY AND SO THE FACT MEANING YOU HAVE TO ADOPT AND ACCELERATE DEMAND MANAGEMENT. WHERE THE STATE CAN REALLY HELP PAUL MENTIONED- SOME SOME SUPPORT THE DEED OF YOURS PROVIDING ACCOUNTING TOOLS AT ALL OF THOSE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT CAN CAN HELP WITH THIS A LOT. THE THIRD IS PROMOTING REALISTIC EFFORTS ON NEW SUPPLIES. AND THIS IS WHERE YOU KNOW GETTING SO PEOPLE ARE NOT COUNTING THE SAME DROPS MULTIPLE TIMES. I THINK THAT THE STATE OF THE BOTH THE OF YOU ARE IN THE STATE BOARD THEY BOTH BEEN DOING A LOT TO TRY TO PROMOTE RECHARGE. THROUGH IN VARIOUS WAYS BUT THIS IS WHERE JOINT COORDINATED EFFORTS CENTER PROBABLY MENTIONED ARE THERE WAYS TO. HAVE YOU KNOW YOUR IN THE STATE BOARD COORDINATE. MORE THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE- RELIEF THAT DETERMINE OF- TO HELP REALLY ENCOURAGE COORDINATION AMONG PARTIES ON THOSE RECHARGE EFFORTS RATHER THAN JUST FIGHTING OVER THE SCRAPS AND FACILITATING PERMITTING WHICH IS A BIG ISSUE. FOUR IS- ASSESSING WATER THE SMART INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME REGIONAL INVESTMENTS NOT JUST LOCAL ONES THAT ARE GONNA BE IMPORTANT AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT STATE ROLE TO THINK ABOUT THAT- AND HELP AND ANALYZE THAT AND THEN FIFTH IS START. HELPING TO PLAN FOR SUCCESSFUL FARMLAND TRANSITIONS IN BOTH CENTER PROBABLY AND I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER DICKINSON MENTION THIS. IN THEIR REMARKS THAT YET LANCE GOING TO COME OUT OF PRODUCTION OVER TIME WITH THIS WE ESTIMATE THAT AT LEAST A HALF MILLION ACRES IN THIS REGION IS GOING TO COME OUT THAT'S THAT'S THE IF ALL GOES WELL- AND THAT'S A LOT OF LAND THAT'S 1015% THAT'S GOOD THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT COMING OUT. NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT DONE IN THE HAPHAZARD WAY- THEY WANT TO SEE IT DONE IN WAYS THAT. YOU DON'T DON'T CAUSE HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH WITH DUST- AND THAT. BRING AS MUCH REVENUE AS POSSIBLE AND SO THEIR OPPORTUNITIES IN THE VALLEY FOR THE SOLAR IS ONE OF THEM. WHICH REALLY ALIGNS WITH STATE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS- BUT THERE ARE OTHERS IN TERMS OF HABITAT TO THIRTY BY THIRTY- THAT THAT CENTER PROBABLY MENTIONED. THERE MAY BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU KNOW DRYLAND CROPPING AS WELL IN SOME CASES. PLANNING IS GOING TO BE KEY FOR THIS AND THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOT TO BE LED LOCALLY BUT THE STATE CAN REALLY PROVIDE IMPORTANT SUPPORT. THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION FARMLANDS YOUR REPURPOSE SAYING- SUPPORT IS A GOOD START TO START THERE BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT THE STATE CAN DO TO HELP THIS. AND WITH THAT I WILL. STOP AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR THIS PRESENTATION- QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SALLY. SO IN ALL THE DATA ANALYSIS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE IN REGARDS TO- IN CAPTURING THOSE WATERS- BABY BEING. IS THERE ANY TALK OR I GUESS CONSIDERATION ABOUT THE WATER STORAGE SO IF WE HAD. THE PROPOSED WATER STORAGE THAT WERE IT WAS IN THE WATER BOND BUILT AND WE STORING THOSE. GALLONS RIGHT NOW DURING THE WHAT YEARS WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR THE REST OF THE STATE AND THE FARMER SPECIFICALLY I MEAN YOU TALK ABOUT HALF A MILLION ACRES COMING OUT OF PRODUCTION I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE RIGHT NOW LISTING THAT ARE. HAVING SOME IN A MAJOR ANXIETY OVER THAT SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT AT ALL. SHOP ASSISTANT THE A MAYBE OVER WILL ALSO WANT TO CHIME IN- SO- IN IN THIS REGION. AND WE LOOK WE LOOK AND I WAS SAY WHENI SAY WE ARE ALL OF OUR SPECIALLY LOOKED AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS AND WHAT THAT WOULD BRING INTO THE INTO THE VALLEY. YOUR TEMPERANCE FLAT WAS ONE. WHAT LOCAL RESERVOIR THAT A LOT OF FOLKS HAD HOPES FOR. IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE WATER AND IT IN THE END. THE IT WHAT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO FARMERS IN THE IN THE VALLEY TO. PROVIDE THE CARSHARE FOR THAT- SO THERE ARE SOME. SOME FOLKS IN THE VALLEY WHO ARE ARE THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HAVE SOME INVESTMENT SHARES INSIGHTS AND THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT ST LOUIS EXPANSION THING SO THAT. THERE MAY BE SOME SURFACE WATER EXPANSIONS THAT. COULD BE HELPFUL BUT THE BUT THE BIG PLAYS IN THE VALLEY ARE REALLY AROUND. THE SMART ECONOMIC PLAYS AROUND RECHARGE ABOUT STORAGE TO AND THERE'S REALLY SOPHISTICATED GROUNDWATER STORAGE. ALREADY TAKING PLACE IN THIS REGION FROM YOU KNOW PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. SO THE KEY IS KIND OF MAKING MORE OF THAT HAPPENED AND OVER MAYBE YOU WANNA. ADD ON YOU KNOW SORT OF WHAT IT WOULD HAVE HELPED THIS YEAR IF WE ALREADY GOT MORE. THANKS BUT QUESTION. YES FOR SURE THAT YOU KNOW WOULD HELP HOPE SOME- IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW ABOUT I THINK THAT THE- THE- YIELD THANK YOUR MIKE. IS ON BECAUSE BEACON TIME THANK YOU- THE DEALFROM THE REST OF US ABOUT- JUST EMITTED IN THE BLOOD WAS ALL TWO HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY. THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR ON AVERAGE THESE YOU KNOW WHAT WE WILL HAVE MUCH LESS THAN THAT. JUST FOR REFERENCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET- OFF. NEW POTENTIAL ONE AVAILABLE ON WHAT WE ARE ESTIMATING IS MORE MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I COULD FEED. OFF OTHER DRAFT SO YES IT COULD HAVE HELPED A LITTLE. BUT EVEN WITH. SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS- WE ESTIMATED THAT THE IT'S KIND OF ESSENTIAL TO REDUCE SOME- FOREMAN SOME PROBLEM. MISTER CAR. THANK YOU. AND IS IN REGARDS TO- NUMBER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM PLANNING WHAT HAVE YOU AND THERE WAS A LITTLE MENTION OF BUTLAND'S DURING THE COURSE OF PRESENTATIONS BUT- AND THIS QUESTION GO TO MIGRANTS FROM ONE ROOM FEELS THEY CAN THEY CAN THEY HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT IT HOW ARE AGENCIES ENSURING THAT THE STATE'S REMAINING WETLANDS BUT CONTINUE TO HAVE THE WATER THEY NEED DURING SIGMA IMPLEMENTATION- BECAUSE SOMETIMES I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IS A LOT OF ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED REGARDING FARMLAND TRANSITION. ARE CRITICAL BOOK BUT- THOSE WEAPONS OBVIOUSLY ARE INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE HABITATS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE VERY MUCH OF IMPORTANT PART. OF THE CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD. SO THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION IN THIS REGION WHICH IS A PRETTY DRY REGION I MEAN ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S- IT'S GOT A BIG OVERLAP PROBLEM IS BECAUSE- IT DEPENDS A LOT ON ON SURFACE WATER THAT'S- NOT ALWAYS THERE RIGHT- SO THERE ARE MANAGE WETLANDS THAT RECEIVE THAT HAVE PRETTY SENIOR ALLOCATION SENIOR RIGHTS IN A WAY TO IS TO THE SURFACE WATER- THAT ARE PART OF THIS CENTRAL VALLEY MANAGED. WETLANDS COMPLEX AND THERE THERE'S A LOT OF COOPERATION THERE- WITH WITH LOCAL GROWERS IN SOME PLACES AS PART OF THE WATER PROJECT PLANNING SO YOU'RE SEEING PLACES LIKE CROSSINGS WATER DISTRICT THAT IS COOPERATING WITH LOCAL ATTIC AND THEY'RE FINDING WAYS TO KIND OF GROW THE PIE THROUGH SOME THROUGH LOCAL INVESTMENTS. THE BIG CHALLENGE FOR- WATER SUPPLY FOR THE MANAGE WETLANDS IS THAT THERE ARE SOME PRIVATE WETLANDS ESPECIALLY THAT ALSO PUMP THAT THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THEY FART THEY FARM WETLANDS BY BY PUMPING GROUNDWATER AND SO THERE'S A CONCERN THAT SOME OF THOSE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE. YOU IN THE SAME WAY THAT AG WILL BE CUT IN SOME PLACES THAT THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE PUT ON A DIET SO THERE THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT THAT BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF INTEREST RIGHT NOW IN. OPPORTUNITIES FOR MULTI BENEFIT RECHARGE AND THAT'S WHERE A PLACE LIKE THE KERN WATER BANK IS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF. YOU CAN HAVE- A WETLAND INTERMITTENT WETLAND THAT'S RECHARGING GROUNDWATER IF YOU STRUCTURE IT IN A IN THE WAY THAT IT KIND OF IS AMBLING INTO IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO VISIT AND YOU'LL SEE YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S WATER THERE. THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF WILDLIFE AND SO IT'S A REALLY VALUABLE PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM AND SO YOU KNOW SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION FUNDING I'M GUESSING IT KINDA HOPING WILL GO TOWARD PROJECTS THAT LOOK THAT AIM TO DO THAT KIND OF MULTI BENEFIT RECHARGE SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S A NICE USE. OF A FORMER FARMLAND ACTUALLY AWAY IN THE- SHE- YES AND- ALANKO COVER THAT VERY WELL BUT THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WE'RE GOING TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE SPECIALLY THOSE PRIVATE WETLANDS THAT ARE REALLY DEPENDENT ON GROUNDWATER PUMPING IN AND FOR BASINS THAT. ASCETIC ALLOCATIONS- YOU KNOW THE ALLOCATIONS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT SIMILAR TO TWO OF OUR CROP- SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THA. GOING AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER ASPECT FOR BOTH BASINS DURING IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE GOING TO BE POSED THE QUESTION HOW THEY'RE ADDRESSING- BUT WHAT USES AND USERS AND GROUNDED ECOSYSTEMS- BUT THEY'LL ALSO PROBABLY NEED TO BE SOME OF THE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE. MORE OF THE STATE'S- WEAPONS SO THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IF I GO IS A QUICK I HAVE IS I BELIEVE THE DOUBLE OR WHAT SICK GO CHALLENGES YOU HAVE SEEN ESPECIALLY IN THOSE BASINS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE GSA'S AND THAT ARE CREATING. THE FULL ARTICLE GSA IN MULTIPLE GEOGRAPHIES WHICH IS- ALLOWED FOR IN THE LAW- DOES CREATE COMPLEXITIES AND ITS COMPLEXITIES THAT BOTH LOCAL AGENCIES- CHOSE TO TAKE ON TO THEMSELVES. THEN THEY BASE THEM ON THEIR OWN IT DOES REQUIRE THAT WHEN IT MORE THAN ONE PLANTS IT IS THE SAME DAY THE SAME METHODOLOGY SO FROM OUR END WE WANT TO SEE. THOSE PLANS. IN THE AGGREGATE SPEAK ON THE BASE AND THERE'S A WHOLE- SO DOING THAT IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT IF THEY'RE NOT USING THE SAME DATA METHODOLOGY WHICH IS INCONSISTENT BLOCK SO THAT'S ONE OF THE DEFICIENCIES ARE WE IDENTIFIED BUT- YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE AWESOME. AREAS WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONE G. AS INTERFACE AND THEY WORK TOGETHER ONE- WHICH IS- ANOTHER COMPLEXITY- AND THEN THE BEEN SOME BASINS THAT HAVE HAD ONE OF MY GSA. MORE THAN ONE GST. AND DID IT IN A WAY THAT WAS. WITH ALSO DOES RUN THE BEFORE YOU GET INTO WATER ONE PLAN DOES- SOME. THAT ARE. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO OVERCOME WE LOOK CLOSELY AT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS MYSELF- FIRST PAUL WELL YOU'RE ON CAN YOU I'M THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTED PARTIES HERE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE INTERESTS OF THE FARMERS BUT ALSO THE DOMESTIC WEALTH HOLDERS WHO ARE REALLY AFFECTED BY THIS- INCREASED PUMPING SO COULD WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE AND WIDE HOW WE CONTINUE TO ENSURE THERE AT THE TABLE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS. YEAH THAT THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND- AGAIN. YOU KNOW POINTS CAME OUT. YOU KNOW THESE ARE LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES SEVEN PRODUCT BOB WHAT PROCESS. BUT SIGNATURE CREATED A MUCH HIGHER BAR FOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT FOR BURKE. A LOT OF GOOD REASONS JUST THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS- SO REMEMBER RIDING- TOOLS AND GUIDANCE OCT AGENCIES. I DON'T GATE. OF THE PUBLIC FACILITATION. SERVICES HAS BEEN REALLY CREDIT- BUT WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE. ARE SOME CHOI IN SOME BASS- ON STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT- AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN THAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO WORK WITH THEM TO IMPROVE- STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTS MAKE SURE EVERYONE AT THE TABLE- THE COMMUNITY IS FULLY ENGAGED WHEN THESE IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE MADE- SO WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT OTHER TOOLS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS- IN THE PLAN THEY THEY ARE REQUIRED IN THE PLAN TO HAVE A COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT PLAN. SO THOSE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE LOOKED AT AND WE DO HAVE- IN THIS SUBJECT GRANT- FUNDING TO UPDATE THOSE IN. AND IMPROVE TALK. THANK YOU IS YOU KNOW. ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER IS ONE OF THIS LEGISLATURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ACCESS. TO THAT WATER AS WELL. A QUESTION FOR MAYBE JAMES- BUT THE STATE WATER BOARD. SO THERE'S QUITE A FEW PLANS THAT ARE WE'RE HOPING WE'LL GET THEM FIXED IN THE COMING MONTHS BUT- IF THEY DO NOT AND IF WE END UP WITH. SAY SIX PLANS THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD NEEDS TO INTERVENE ON CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE ABOUT CAPACITY AND THE ABILITY TO DO THAT THAT SEEMS CONCERNING THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO. INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT YOU LAID OUT. DURING YOUR PRESENTATION. YEAH THANK YOU GREAT QUESTION SO ABSOLUTELY BOTH THE PROCESS OF CONSIDERING WHETHER A BASIN SHOULD BE PUT INTO PROBATION- AND THEN ASSESSING AND TRACKING THEIR PROGRESS DURING PROBATION. THOSE ARE BOTH GOING TO BE VERY LABOR INTENSIVE- AND WE DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND. BOTH THE PLANS FOR THESE BASINS BUT ALSO THE CONDITIONS IN THOSE BASINS- IT'S ALSO HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THIS POINT- HOW MANY BASINS MAY COME IN TO THE BOARD'S JURISDICTION. WE'RE HOPING THAT EVERYONE WILL RESOLVE ALL THE DEFICIENCIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. ACCIDENT OF FIDE- BUT YEAH IT'S THEIR MEDICALLY POSSIBLE- THE BILL ALL FIX THEIR DEFICIENCIES OR MAYBE. MANY MANY WILL NOT- BE ABLE TO DO SO IN TIME IN THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS- WINDOW THAT WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOW. IN THAT CASE THE WATER BOARD WILL BE PRIORITIZING- OUR WORK AS BEST AS WE CAN. I AM WOULD JUST YOU TO. YOU KNOW- ASSEMBLY BLOOM WAS HERE EARLIER BUT I KNOW HE'S LISTENING AS WELL BUT IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE ENSURE SUCCESS FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY PLANS AND OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVING THE RESOURCES TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS CRITICAL SO. I HOPE THAT CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE. LASTLY A QUESTION FOR HIM. YEAH I SEE WHICH IS. I'M BOTH SENATOR PAVEL IN YOU SPOKE ABOUT DEMAND MANAGEMENT WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY PIECE OF THIS BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT FARM TRANSITION WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FARM TRANSITION YOU TALKED ABOUT- HOME SOLAR AND- WETLAND OPPORTUNITIES AND I GUESS I REALLY WANT TO TOUCH ON THE IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT YOUR TIME AND A LOT OF JOBS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE'S. INCOME AND THAT'S REAL AND THAT'S IMPORTANT AND WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WE ALSO CARE ABOUT ECONOMIC JUSTICE I WANT. YOU TO TOUCH ON PLEASE. RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S IT THAT'S IT A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT I THINK IT'S TOP OF MIND FOR EVERYBODY IN THE VALLEY- AND IT IS DEFINITELY AN IMPORTANT LINES FOR US IN IN THE WORK. IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THINKING ABOUT DEMAND MANAGEMENT IN A IN A DOING DEMAND MANAGEMENT IN A FLEXIBLE WAY IS IMPORTANT IF YOU REMEMBER THAT SET OF CHARTS YOU KNOW IF THERE CAN BE WELL MANAGED TRADING. OF GROUND WATER IN THE BASIN AND WELL MANAGED MOVEMENT OF SURFACE WATER SO THAT THE WATER IS GOING TO YOU KNOW THAT THE THINGS THAT ARE THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GENERATING THEM THE MOST. ECONOMY COMFORT FOR THE AREA THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS FOR THE FARMERS BOTTOM LINE- AND SO THAT THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN A WAY THAT ALSO IS MAKING SURE THAT IT'S A YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE WHAT DRINKING WATER IN THEIR WELLS BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO IF YOU IF YOU TAKE THAT WIDE LANDS ON IT. AND CONSIDER THOSE PERSPECTIVE YOU CAN SET UP PROGRAMS THAT DO THAT WELL AND- THIS IS YOU KNOW WHY KIND OF GETTING THE BASICS IN PLACE FOR DEMAND MANAGEMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO NOW AND IT'S- YOU. IT'S INTERESTING THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME PROGRESS IN SOME PLACES OVER LAST COUPLE YEARS AND I. HAVE A LITTLE TO SHOUT OUT TO THE TULE BASIN WHICH IS ONE OF THE ONES THAT. HAS SOME SERIOUS ISSUES IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW. FOLKS DO IT DEFENSE COMMUNITIES WITH. DRINKING WATER RISKS ALSO LAND SUBSIDENCE THEY HAVE TO IN WATCH OUT PARTS OF PARTS OF THE OF THE AREA ARE. IMPACTING THE FRANK FROM CANAL. THOSE DISTRICTS HAVE ALREADY PUT IN PLACE ALLOCATION SYSTEMS WITH FEES IT'S ENFORCED. THE SO LAST YEAR THIS PAST GROWING SEASON THEY ALREADY WERE. OPERATING ON A ON A WATER DIET ON UNDERGROUND WATER DIET BECAUSE- THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND- THOSE THAT'S A- A GOOD. IT THESE KIND OF PILOTS THESE KIND OF INNOVATIVE IN THE FOR THE FRONT INNOVATORS ON THIS. CAN BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR. KIND OF HELPING HELPING TO SET THE TONE FOR HOW YOU CAN DO THAT AND WORK OUT SOME OF THE KINKS. SO THAT'S THAT'S IT BUT A KEY PIECE FOR THE ECONOMY. THANK YOU WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT BACK TO. FIVE AGUIAR-CURRY. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO NOW TO. SIGNAL ON THE GROUND LOCAL AGENCY PERSPECTIVE ON GOVERNANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION- I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS SO FAR THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN VERY GOOD AND VERY INFORMATIVE- WELL FIRST IT WAS SIERRA RYAN WITH THEIR WATER RESOURCE MANAGER FROM SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. AND I BELIEVE SHE'S ON THE LINE SIERRA. YEAH CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN. WELCOME GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. RIGHT GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES THAT I HAVE HAD THE STIGMA. MY NAME IS SIERRA RYAN AND I'M A LOT OF RESOURCES MANAGER FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ. THANK IS A SMALL COUNTY OTHER CENTRAL COAST BETWEEN MONTEREY AND SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE POPULATION AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE. JOHNNY IS NOT CONNECTED TO ANY OF THE STATE OR FEDERAL WATER SUPPLY PROGRAMS. ALL OF OUR WATER SOURCES ARE LOCALLY DERIVED SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER THERE IS A SMALL AMOUNT AND NOT ALL RECYCLED WATER CURRENTLY USED FOR IRRIGATION. AN INCREDIBLE REYES PROJECT IN DEVELOPMENT BACKGROUND WATER IS STILL CRITICAL FOR OUR WATER SUPPLY HERE IN THE COUNTY. DESPITE THE COUNTY RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THREE TSA IS THAT REFLECT THE RANGE OF APPROACHES THE THING THAT COMPLIANCE. LARA VALLEY WATER MANAGEMENT AGENCY OVERSEES A CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASIN AND SUBMITTED AN ALTERNATIVE PLAN TO A DSP WHICH WAS APPROVED BY DNR IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THEY COMPLETED THEIR FIVE YEAR UPDATE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SANTA CRUZ MID COUNTY GROUNDWATER AGENCY OVERSEES ANOTHER CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASS AND BASS EMITTED MERRY TST IN TWENTY TWENTY AND IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TWO DSPS IT WAS APPROVED TANK YOU HAVE YOU ARE IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SANTA MARGARITA GROUNDWATER AGENCY IS A MEDIUM PRIORITY BASIN BUT STILL NEEDED ITS D. S. P. DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT THERE HAD THE ARE ALL ONE. BECAUSE ONE IN AN SUBMITTING ONE AS YOU PLEASE SAYS THAT THE AND THE COME. TINA PARTS THE STATE WE'RE NOT PROBLEM. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY BACKGROUND WHAT. BASINS IN ABOUT MINUTES WELL NUMEROUS NOT WATER SYSTEMS AND INTERCONNECTED SURFACE WATER SUPPORTING ENDANGERED SPECIES- AS FOR MY ROLE IN THESE AGENCIES THE COUNTY IS A MEMBER OF THE JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IS THAT FORMED BOTH THE SANTA CRUZ NAY COUNTY AND THE SANTA MARGARITA GROUND WATER AGENCIES. I SERVE ON THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES OF BOTH AGENCIES AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THEM SINCE THEIR INCEPTION AGENCY WAS ACTUALLY FORMED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND WAS SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT IN A SINGLE LEGISLATION. BUT I DID SERVE ON THE AD HOC COMMITTEE THAT THEY CREATED TO INFORM THEIR FIVE YEAR UPDATE LAST YEAR LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE FEEL LIKE HAS BEEN WORKING- WELL AT THE INDIVIDUAL GSA LEVEL. AS WELL AS THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AN OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER SUPPORT FROM THE STATE LEVEL. WHAT'S WORKING FOR US THEY MIGHT HAS BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT CATALYST FOR PROGRESS IN BOTH GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT AND REGIONAL COLLABORATION. IT HELPS TO REINFORCE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GROUNDWATER ISSUES AND IT PROVIDES LEVERAGE AND INCENTIVES TO BASINS THAT HIS STRUGGLE TO PRIORITIZE THESE ISSUES IN THE PAST. IMAGINE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS IN THE COUNTY THE WATER INTRUSION REPRESENTS AN ALMOST EXISTENTIAL THREATS IN THE WAY OF LIFE IN THOSE AREAS. AT RISK IS NOT NEW HOWEVER IN THE BASINS THANKFULLY DIDN'T WAIT UNTIL SAYING THAT WAS PASSED THIS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO PROPOSE SOLUTIONS. IF THE COLORS HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR DECADES ON ON THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT ACTIONS NEEDED TO PROTECT THE BASE AND WE'RE ALREADY IN DEVELOPMENT AT THAT. AT THE TIME SAYING THAT WAS PASSED. YES YES HE IS IN A- CASE AND THAT'S- WHERE IN ANYWAY A LOT NEXT FOR ORGANIZING AND ADVANCING- THE EXISTING AFTER IT'S- BEEN IN A MEDIUM PRIORITY BASIN. THEY MIGHT HAS LED TO A MUCH MORE FORMALIZED EFFORTS TO STUDY THE BASIN- AND TO DEVELOP AGREEMENT AMONGST THE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT EVEN WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. AND HOW TO PRIORITIZE THE APPROACH TO MOVE FORWARD. ALL OF THE GSA I AM IN WITH THE FEDERAL PLEASANT EXPERIENCE WITHOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD STAFF AND WE'VE WORKED WITH. OURDATA YOUR DATA CONTACTS ARE REGULARLY ATTENDED PART IN STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS- WHICH IS EASY ENOUGH TO DO NOW AND ORIGINAL THAT PRE TWENTY TWENTY THEY WERE DRIVING UP FROM FRESNO ON A MONTHLY BASIS FOR THESE EVENING MEETINGS. I'M THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE AND HELPFUL WHEN WE NEED THEIR INPUT AND ADVICE- STAFF AND THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD EVEN CANNOT PRESENTED AT ONE OF OUR PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS THAT WE HELP FOR ONE OF OUR BASINS. AND ALL VERY NICE PEOPLE WE'VE JUST REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH THEM- ALL OF ALL THREE OF THE CASES IN THE COUNTY HAVE RECEIVED GRANTS- HOUSE LIMIT ALREADY DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GRANT FUNDS THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE- AND THAT HAS BEEN MONUMENTALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ABILITY OF THESE. AREAS TO COMPLY WITH CIGNA IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. I CANNOT OVERSTATE HOW CRITICAL THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE THAT THE STATE HAS OFFERED HIS BENEFIT THESE BASINS- WE'VE ALSO REALLY GREATLY APPRECIATED THE GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE RELEASED THEY'VE BEEN THEY WERE VERY HELPFUL- AS WE WERE DEVELOPING OUR PLANS. IN TERMS SHALL. WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT SANTA. COUNTY THAT THE MANY- IN THE COUNTY HAVE BEEN WORKING. FROM TIME. AS I SAY IF YOU'RE- OVER. BY ALREADY HAD A HEAD START IN TERMS OF COLLABORATION AND PLANNING. I THINK I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU TODAY. IT A CHALLENGE IT HAS TIME OUT OUT THE PATH FIRST DATES FOR SUSTAINING. AND THE MEDIUM. BASIN ALONE LOS WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS TAKE YEARS TO DECADES OF PLANNING. AND IMPLEMENT- AND THAT MEANS THAT WELL WE HAVE SEVERAL PROJECTS NOW KIND OF AND IS VERY INITIAL PLANNING PHASE. THERE'S A GREAT DEAL MORE STUDY AND PILOT TESTING THAT NEEDS TO BE AS- THE FIRM CAN EVEN ESTABLISH OUR BEST WAY FORWARD AND START DEVELOPING THESE IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS THROUGH. YOU KNOW IT IS A SEAT BY GETTING FUNDING AND IMPLEMENTING. I SUSPECT THAT MANY OF THE DSPS EVEREST AMENDED LAST MONTH WILL FACE WELL I'VE BEEN FACING SIMILAR CHALLENGES- BUT YES FEES ARE CONSIDERED A LIVING DOCUMENT DOCUMENT AND IT IS ALLOWABLE TO NOT KNOW EVERYTHING YET BUT WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT IF IT'S GOING TO TAKE OVER A DECADE TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS. THAT DOESN'T LEAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR THOSE PROJECTS TO BRING THE BASIN TO SUSTAINABILITY BY. OUR- TWENTY YEAR DEADLINE. IN TERMS OF ON GOING SUPPORT THE NAME THAT I WILL AND YOU WILL FROM OTHERS AS WELL AS THEIR- ON GOING FINANCIAL. SUPPORT FROM THE STATE TO THE GSA'S IN OUR EFFORTS TO RENDON'S AGENCIES TO COMPLY WITH THE MONITORING AND REPORTING. AND ULTIMATELY WITH IMPLEMENTATION IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THEIR ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL- TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS I'LL GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION FROM THE SANTA MARGARITA GROUNDWATER AGENCY WHICH- OVERSEES AND MEDIUM PRIORITY BASIN. THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING WITH IN THE BASIN BOUNDARY AND THEY'RE USING ONLY TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED ACRE FEET OF. GROUND WATER PER YEAR. AND THAT IS. VERY SMALL COMPARED TO SOME OF THESE YES A SENSE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE SOMETIMES TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER SO THERE'S JUST NO ECONOMY OF SCALE HERE. RDSA BUDGET IS AROUND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR JUST AROUND THE TSA AND MEET THE MONITORING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF STIGMA. THAT NUMBER DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECTS ARE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS NEEDED TO REACH THE SAME ABILITY. AND IT DOESN'T REALLY INCLUDE THE MONITORING THAT THE MEMBER AGENCIES WERE ALREADY DOING IN TERMS OF THEIR GROUNDWATER ELEVATION. THE DSA IS MEMBER FUNDED- FROM THAT MEMBERS OF THE JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. AND SO THAT IS A LOT OF ADDITIONAL COST TO PUT ON PRIMARILY WATER RATEPAYERS BECAUSE AND IN THIS SPACE AND WE DON'T HAVE. REALLY ANY LARGE. AB IS IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY. AGRICULTURE IT'S REALLY JUST DOWN TO URBAN AND RURAL RESIDENTIAL- IT'S NOT AN AFFLUENT AREA BUT IT'S ALSO NOT CONSIDERED TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY OTHER PARTS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST THEY WERE IN THE MOST RECENT- ITERATION OF THOSE ITS ADVANTAGE COMMUNITY MAPS. WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPERATIONALIZE OUR COSTS IN A WAY THAT IS BOTH EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE. IN ORDER FOR THIS BASIN AND I'M SURE MANY OTHERS JUST TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE GSA ONGOING SUPPORT FROM THE STATE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. IT DOESN'T ONLY MEAN DIRECT FUNDS BUT IT COULD ALSO MEAN ADDITIONAL GUIDACE DOCUMENTS FROM THE STATE ON OPTIONS TO RAISE FUNDING IN SUPPORT OF SAME MATH- FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT- EXACTLY WHAT. WHAT FEES WERE ALLOWED TO CHARGE AND HOW WE WOULD USE PROP TO EIGHTEEN WHETHER WE CAN GET. SOMETHING FEES THINGS LIKE THAT SEVEN MORE GUIDANCE WOULD BE REALLY REALLY HELPFUL. WHEN FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE FROM THE STATE IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO GO TOWARDS OPERATING EXPENSES LIKE ADMINISTRATION MONITORING AND REPORTING AND NOT JUST PROJECTS- FINALLY THAT SUPPORT SHOULD ALSO BE EASY FOR THE TSA'S ACCESS. IT IS A REALLY HUGE LEFT FOR IT- ARE TAKING A MEMBER AGENCY STAFF TO WRITE LONG ARDUOUS GRANT APPLICATIONS. AND THE BUDGETS OF THE AGENCIES ARE SO TIGHT THAT. IT'S REALLY NOT AN OPTION TO HIRE A CONSULTANT WHEN WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE- GRANT. FUNDING WILL EVEN BE RECEIVED. I'M ONE FUNDING DIRECTED AT PROJECT PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THE HISTORIC SPAN OF. SPENDING ON SHOVEL READY PROJECTS PUT SOME OF THESE SMALLER BASINS THAT WERE ALREADY BEHIND IN PROJECT DEVELOPMENT. EVEN FURTHER BEHIND. THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF FEAR THAT THE STATE IS GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY NOW. WELL THINK NIGHT STILL NEW AND THERE'S A BUDGET SURPLUS- AND THAT THAT FUNDING WILL BE FOCUSED ONLY ON SHOVEL READY IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS OR AT LEAST PRIORITIZE FORCE ALREADY IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS FOR THE TSA'S. AND BY THE TIME THESE MEDIUM AND HIGH PRIORITY BASINS WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP SHOVEL READY PROJECTS. THIS IS. A WOMAN OF DON. AND THERE WON'T BE ANY FUNDING AVAILABLE. BELT BACKING MACRON FOR NOW THAT I. VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THAT ANY MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS A GREAT OVERVIEW AND UP FOR PRE **** ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'RE ALL DOING- WE ALL KNOW HOW VALERIE KING. PARTNERSHIP PERRIS KING CAME THE WORST CHEF SKI. LLP REPRESENTING CURRENT GROUNDWATER AUTHORITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR AND- ADVICE CHAIR I I'M GONNA PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE- WE ACTUALLY OUR OFFICE REPRESENTS GSA'S WATER DISTRICTS- CITIES AND COUNTIES FROM SISKIYOU COUNTY DOWN TO KERN COUNTY SO. I MIGHT MY DAILY LIFE IS FILLED WITH- GSA'S CALLING ME AND ASKING ME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO COMPLY WITH SAID MA HOW TO FORM I'M TRYING TO DO SEVERAL THINGS SO I'M I'M GONNA TOUCH ON FOUR ISSUES. THAT I SEE- COME UP THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ARE ARE CONSISTENT AMONG GSA QUESTIONS ABOUT SITE MAP. BEFORE YOU DO THAT THAT WAY I DO WANT TO TALK REALLY BRIEFLY ABOUT WHERE WE'VE COME AND SOME PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT- GIVEN MY NAY THIS IS BOSTON TWENTY FOURTEEN. A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE SURFACE WATER SYSTEM- AND STATEWIDE PERMITTING. RULES WERE PASSED AND WHEN WE ARE DEVELOPING SICK MY AND FOLKS WERE GIVING FEEDBACK TO THE AUTHORS OF SIGMA ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS WAS TO SEE THE LEGISLATIVE. HISTORY IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN. DISCUSSED POSSIBLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT AND HOW THE LEGISLATURE THAT TIME SAID WE CAN'T DO THAT IS JUST TOO DIFFICULT IT TOOK AN ENTIRE HUNDRED YEARS. TO KIND OF RECOVER FROM THAT. CASICH LESSON A VERY DIFFERENT LAW. THAN SERVICE WATER RIGHT. SERVICE WATER REGULATIONS HOUSE. FROM THE TOP DOWN I THE STATE WERE RESOURCES CONTROL. AND IT'S A PERMITTING LOCK RIGHT SO WE HAVE A VERY LOCAL. PLANNING BOX THAT IS THAT IS NOT NO ONE IS ISSUING GROUNDWATER PERMITS UNDERSUPPLY SO IT'S A VASTLY DIFFERENT- THE PLAN IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND FRANKLY MUCH MORE- LOCAL BASED. SO WHAT HAPPENED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I THINK LARGELY GSA'S DID A GREAT JOB OF THIS. WAS THAT YOU HAD A HUGE NUMBER OF NEW PUBLIC AGENCIES BEING FORMED. RIGHT GSA'S OUR PUBLICATION SEES SOMETIMES THEIR GPAS SOMETIMES THERE ARE JUST A NEW HOT THAT IN EXISTING AGENCIES WEARING. BUT THAT WAS A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK. AND TAKING ON THAT THE SIGMOD KIND OF CHARGED AS IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT AND I'M I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I'M AMAZED DAY TODAY TO CD'S AGENCIES STEP UP. AND DO THE WORK AND PUT IT TO THE WORK AND NOT ONLY FORMING. BUT YOU KNOW W. R. AND- OTHER FOLKS HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW MANY AGENCIES GOT THROUGH THAT TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEADLINE- THERE WERE THERE WERE NO. LOCAL AGENCIES THAT SAID WE'RE JUST NOT DOING THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY IT STATE YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. SO THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK DONE AT THE GSA LEVEL I MEAN PEOPLE REALLY DEDICATED TO GETTING IT DONE AND YOU SEE THAT ALSO WITH THE COMPLETION OF PLANTS BOTH IN THE TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE. AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO- IN TWENTY TWENTY THERE WAS ONE PLAN THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT LATE AND IT CAME IN A MONTH OR TWO LATER. AND TWENTY TWENTY TO BRING UP THE PLANSAND- SO I DON'T WANT. THIS COMMITTEE TO MISUNDERSTAND THAT THE- HUGE EFFORT BY LOCAL AGENCIES AND IT HAS BEEN LARGELY SUCCESSFUL. AND HAVING SAID THAT I THINK THERE ARE FOUR QUESTIONS THAT COME UP CONTINUALLY IN MY PRACTICE. A FROM. FROM LIKE I SAID STATEWIDE. ONE IS FUNDING SIERRA JUST TOUCH THAT QUITE BIT SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO IN. THAT IN GREAT. BUT ADAM SAID WHAT IS THIS FOR NOT FOR CLEAR. ON THE AUTHORITY OF FUNDING- HOW TO EIGHTEEN. TWENTY SIX AND- THE SICK MY THIRTIES THEMSELVES- WHAT IS WHAT IS THOSE PROVIDE. IN A RELACIONAMENT MENTION GROUNDWATER PUMPING- FUNDING WHICH IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT SO YOU HAVE DIFFERENT AGENCIES FUNDING THE GSA'S VASTLY DIFFERENT LIKE SUMMER MEMBER FUNDED LIKE SEARS SOME HAVE DONE IT TO EIGHTEEN SOME HAVE RELIED ON PROP TWENTY SIX. SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT SAID MY GIVES YOU THE AUTHORITY WITHOUT TO EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY SIX TO JUST EXACT FEES. SO THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION THERE AND THESE ARE VERY VERY COSTLY REGULATIONS TO COMPLY WITH YOU HAVE ANNUAL REPORTS YOU HAVE FIVE YOUR UPDATES YOU HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THAT'S NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT PROJECTS TO GET TO SUSTAINABILITY. SO THERE ARE A FLEET OF BRAND NEW PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE- I KNOW D. W. R. FUNDING HAS BEEN CRITICAL IN GETTING THROUGH THIS FIRST STEP. BUT ADMITS THAT DIES OFF OR IF THAT FUNDING DRIES UP- WE'RE GOING TO BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE SO FUNDING IS A HUGE ISSUE. SECOND D. AVID LAND USE COMPONENTS OF SIGMA AND REALLY SAID MUCH SPECIFICALLY LEFT LAND USE AND WHILE PERMITTING WITH AUTHORITY WITH COUNTIES. THEY DID NOT GIVE THAT TO GSA IS THAT HAS BEEN ATTENTION AND I THINK WILL BE A CONTINUING TENSION OF HOW GSA'S WORK WITH EXISTING COUNTIES. IF WHILE PERMITTING AND WELL APPLICATIONS FOR NEW WELL PERMITS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OR NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE G. S. P. ON THE GROUND. SIGNET DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THAT AT ALL SO THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME COMMUNICATION THERE I KNOW SOME COUNTIES HAVE KIND OF. TRIED TO- FILL THAT GAP AND I THINK WITH MIXED SUCCESS SO FAR I'M NOT SO THAT'S AN OPEN ISSUE THAT I THINK EVERYBODY'S AND HAS ASKED ME ABOUT- THIRD THE ROLES OF GSA'S AND TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT TODAY. WITH WITH THE RIGHT TO DRINKING WATER. AND MITIGATION. ABBOTT HOUSE. AS POWERFUL AS GSA'S IN IT AND I AND A NUMBER OF AUTHORITIES THAT SEGMENT GIVES CSA'S GSA'S ARE NOT WATER PROVIDERS THEY'RE NOT WATER SUPPLIERS. AND SEGMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE REQUIREMENT TO MITIGATE. DOT HAS KIND. OF BEEN READ INTO THE LOCK- AND- YOU KNOW WE SEE HOW THAT GOES BUT BUT- GEN ARE GONNA HAVE TO WORK WITH THE STATE. WAS SAFER WITH COUNTIES AND WITH OTHER WE HAVE THE TOOLS. TO MITIGATE AND PROVIDE FOR AND GOOD QUALITY DRINKING WATER OFTENTIMES. SUCKS THINK THAT GSA'S ARE SADDLED WITH THIS YOU HAVE TO FIX ALL THE DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS. I'M JUST A FRANKLY DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITIES OR THE INFRASTRUCTURE OR THE ON THE GROUND I'M ABILITY TO DO THAT. SO THAT'S AN EXPECTATION WHICH FRANKLY ISN'T INCLUDED IN SEGMENT CURRENTLY. BUT WE'RE GONNA READ THAT INTO SIGMA GOING FORWARD WE'RE GONNA NEED TO GET THESE YES IS A LOT OF HELP. A LOT OF FUNDING. AND TAKE IT TAKE A DIFFERENT LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT INCLUDED. AND THEN FINALLY AND I THINK PROBABLY THE TENSION THAT WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT STATE MY FROM ITS INCEPTION. AND I THINK IT'S ONLY GOING TO INCREASE- IS THE STATE ROLE BEGINS TO POTENTIALLY COME ON. ON BOARD HERE IS THE TENSION BETWEEN LOCAL CONTROL AND STATE REGULATION THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT IN RECHARGE SOMEONE BROUGHT UP THE CURRENT WATER BRING WHICH IS A GREAT. BANKING PROGRAM- BUT IT'S LARGELY BECAUSE IT WAS LOCALLY DRIVEN LOCALLY CONTROLLED. THERE'S NOT. YOU KNOW A HUGE AMOUNT OF STATE REGULATION. DIET IT IS THAT THEY HAVE TO JUMP IT'S AN ESTABLISHED GREAT MULTI BENEFITS- BANKING PROGRAM. BUT IF WE WANT THAT TO HAPPEN STATEWIDE WE'RE GOING TO REALLY HAVE TO THINK CRITICALLY. ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCALS. GETTING THINGS DONE ON THE GROUND AND- THE STATE. HAVING KIND OF AN OVER REGULATORY COMPONENT. SO WE ARE WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE THAT END OF THE DAY OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REVIEW OF PLANS THE STATE LOCAL TENSION. AND OF COURSE THE STATE WATER BOARD WALKED US THROUGH A VERY KIND OF FRAMEWORK VERY HIGH LEVEL PROCESS FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD. AND DETERMINING BASINS WHEN THEIR PROBATIONARY SIGMA FRANKLY DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THAT IT'S VERY VERY FRAMEWORKDRIVEN. DECISIONS AT THE STATE WATER BOARD AND YOU DO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE ON THE GROUND WITH REGARD TO HOW TO KEEP LOCALS IN CONTROL. EVEN IF THEY GO PROBATIONARY AND HOW TO GET LOCAL STEP TO TAKE BACK- AT LOCAL CONTROL OF BASINS WHEN THEY DO GO PROBATIONARY IS VERY MUCH UP IN THE AIR. IT'S GOING TO BE ATTENTION THAT CONTINUES TO REAR ITS HEAD AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE VERY VERY CAREFUL- ABOUT LEADING LOCALS- NOT ONLY. BE ABLE TO DO PROJECTS THAT THAT NEED THAT THEY NEED TO DO TO GET TO SUSTAINABILITY BUT TO GIVE THEM BACK THAT LOCAL CONTROL IF THEY HAVEN'T MET- THE MARKS THAT. ARE SET OUT SO WE'RE GOING TO BE A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THAT- AGAIN LOCALS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FROM REALLY ROLLED UP THEIR SLEEVES. I WORK WITH THEM DAY TO DAY SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE. WORKING- DO YOU GET TO TELL DATA GAPS. I WHICH WERE GIANT. AT THE BEGINNING WAS SICK MONTH- THEY JUST WORKS SO HARD. SO I AM I KNOW THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD INDEED WE ARE HAVE BEEN BOTH TREMENDOUSLY. ON KEEPING LOCAL CONTROL- BUT I THINK FROM A LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT- AB COMPONENTS SEGMENT AS WELL. SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR ISSUES THAT I SEE DAY TO DAY AND I THINK- WILL CONTINUE TO COME UP. AND AGAIN STATEWIDE- FOLKS ASK ABOUT EVERY DAY. SO HOW DO YOU TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND AGAIN THANKS THANKS FOR LETTING US PROVIDE KIND OF THIS LOCAL- ON THE GROUND PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS CAN CAVE- IT WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AGREE WITH LOCAL CONTROL COMPLETELY SO. LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR- FINAL ONE IN- DAVID MORRISON DIRECTOR OF PLANNING BUILDING ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES FROM NAPA COUNTY. AND. WELCOME MY FRIEND DAVID MORRISON. YES IT'S BEEN A WHILE HER YEAH. GOOD MORNING SURE ZAGRA. AND BARRY K. AND- ARE UNDER FOR THE PRO OF SPEAKING BEFORE IT MORNING. I'D LIKE TO BRING REVIEW WHAT NAPA COUNTY'S BEEN DOING. WHERE WE ARE NOW AND WHAT THE NEXT FEW YEARS LOOK LIKE. NEVER COUNTIES BEEN STUDYING GROUNDWATER FOR OVER SIXTY YEARS AND HAS BEEN ACTIVELY MANAGING IT'S OUR PERSONAL PASSED THIRTY YEARS IS NOT A NEW SUBJECT FOR US. OUR LAND USE THE SENATE ON AGRICULTURE THE GENERAL REQUIRES MUCH LESS WATER THAN OTHER CROPS TRY FARM WITH. PROBLEM WATER OR SERVICE WATER. OUR LAND YOU ARE CITIES ALMOST REAL ON SURFACE WATER RECYCLED WATER TO RELIEVE THE AQUIFER. AND WE HAVE STRUCK FARMAN OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION POLICIES IN PLACE SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATION'S FIRST AGRICULTURAL PRESERVE IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. AS A RESULT OF THIS FORWARD THINKING STRATEGY NAPA GROUNDWATER LEVELS ARE HISTORICALLY STABLE WITH LITTLE TO NO SUBSIDENCE OR WATER QUALITY ISSUES THAT WE SEE ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE. THERE ARE SOME OF THE ACTIONS OF CALIFORNIA NAP WAS TAKEN TO PROTECT AND CONSERVE GROUNDWATER OVER THE YEARS. IN NINETEEN NINETY WE ADOPTED OUR WATER AVAILABILITY DALLAS'S GUIDELINES TO EVALUATE THE IMPACTS TO GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION ON NEARBY WELLS. ROTATED TWENTY FIFTEEN TO LOOK AT POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO OCCUR FIRST AND AGAIN TOOK A LOOK AT POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO SURFACE WATER INTERACTION. AND GROUNDWATER DEPENDENT ECOSYSTEMS AGAIN. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WE DESIGNATED PUTS CALLED MILLIKAN SARCO TOOK LATE TO THE CASE WATER DEFICIENT AREAS THIS IS EVERYWHERE YOU SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROUNDWATER WITHDRAWALS AND WHAT WE SAID WAS THAT IT WITHIN THAT AREA MOLANDER MORE WATER THAN THEY WERE USING AT THE TIME IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. SO IF YOU WANTED TO PUT IN A QUARTER ACRE HALF ACRE VINEYARD YOU HAVE TO TAKE OUT YOUR LOCK YOUR TAKE OR JUST WEARING COOL YOU HAD TO CUT BACK ON RESIDENTIAL CONSUMPTION IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER HOUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO THE SAME TAKE OUT TO LANDSCAPING- VINEYARD- THERE'S NO THAT. ARE KNOWN IMPACT. WITH THAT AREA. WE DESIGNATE THE SECOND. TO EIGHTEEN IN THE NORTHEAST AREA. WE CREATED A WATERSHED INFORMATION CONSERVATION COUNCIL TWENTY THOUSAND TO LOOK AT THE WATERSHED WHICH VIDAK AQUIFER'S BASIN ANALYSIS REPORT THAT WAS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CIGNA AS THE ALTERNATIVE GROUNDWATER SOMEPLACE. WE FORM THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE TO WORK VERY VERY HARD VERY VERY FAST YOU CAN CLEAR PLAN WITHIN TWENTY FIVE MONTHS. THAT MAKE THE DEADLINE. A SENIOR WE ALSO JOINED WITH THE CITY OF NAPA AND ENJOY WATERSHED MONITORING STUDY TO SEE WHAT THE IMPACTS OF LAND USE OUR OF THEM JUST RESERVOIRS WORK WITH THE CITIES TO PREPARE DROUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN. AND JUST IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR WE FORMED A DROP OF WATER SHORTAGE TASK FORCE AS A CONSISTENT WITH STATE REQUIREMENTS. ALL THE WORK WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST IS STILL NOT ENOUGH TO MEET OUR CURRENT CHALLENGES. WHAT RANGE OCTOBER DECEMBER IT CERTAINLY HELPED. THE TOTAL FOR THIS YEAR REPRESENTS ONLY 66% OF THE HAD AVERAGE ANNUAL RAINFALL FOR NOW BUT- OUR LOCAL RESERVOIRS ARE NEARLY FULL BUT THEY PROVIDE ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF MUNICIPAL WATER. REMAINDER COMES FROM THE STATEWATER PROJECT WHICH WILL RECEIVE ONLY 25% OF OUR NORMAL LOCATION. THE AMOUNT OF GROUNDWATER STORAGE STABLE BUT HAS DECREASED ABOUT 15% OVER THE PAST TWO THREE YEARS. ALTHOUGH EXISTING CONDITIONS ARE CONCERNING THE FUTURE OUTLOOK IS MORE WORRISOME. EXPERIMENTAL LONG RANGE MODELS RUN BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE AND OTHER AGENCIES INDICATE THE NAPA COUNTY MAY RECEIVE BELOW AVERAGE RAINFALL ALL THE WAY THROUGH APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. NOT ONLY BE MAYBE LOOKING AT A THIRD YEAR DROUGHT THIS SUMMER BUT A FOURTH YEAR DROP NEXT YEAR THREATS THAT WAS FULLY ENGAGED MISTAKE WAS THE CENTERPIECE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO CAREFULLY STORE ARE PREFERRED TO THE FUTURE. BUT THERE'S A LOT TO DO IN A VERY SHORT TIME SO WHAT ARE WE DOING. THAT'S A PASSED WE'RE WE DOING NOW. OUR GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN WAS SUBMITTED TO D. W. ARE JUST LAST MONTH IS CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW. HOWEVER WE'RE QUICKLY MOVING FORWARD WITH IMPLEMENTING THE TOPIC PLAN. WE'RE CREATING A TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP. WEREUSING THE WATERSHED INFORMATIONAL AKA AND CONSERVATION COUNCIL IS A STAKEHOLDER GROUP EXPANDING IT. WE'RE DEVELOPING FOR WORK THANKS TO ADDRESS INTERCONNECTED SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER DEPENDENT ECOSYSTEMS WATER CONSERVATION. GROUNDWATER PUMPING REDUCTION IN STRONG WATER RESOURCES. AND WERE EVALUATING FUTURE FUNDING OPTIONS FOR THE GSA. AT THE SAME TIME ALL THIS IS GOING ON WELLS ACCORDING TO SOME OTHER GROUNDWATER RELATED STATE PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE GENERAL ORDER ONLINE OR JUST CHARGES RECENTLY ISSUED BY THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD WHICH IS A GREAT AFFECT YOUR NAPA. OKAY USED TO LET US FOR GENERAL STORMWATER PROGRAM FOR URBAN AND STORMWATER RUNOFF. OUR LOCAL AGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN TO ADDRESS WASTE WATER. THE GROUND WATER SHORTAGE PLAN THAT WAS REQUIRED SB FIVE FIVE TWO LAST YEAR. RECENT COURT DECISIONS ON DISCRETIONARY WELL APPROVALS AND PUBLIC TRUST THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER ON STATEWIDE WATER CONSERVATION ISSUES LAST MONTH. FIRST WE ARE ALREADY GETTING READY FOR NEXT FIVE YEAR REVIEW AS WELL AS WAITING TO RESPOND ON ANY COMMENTS THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE MAY HAVE OVER THERE TO YOUR REDUCE. WHILE SUPPORT APPROACHES WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING. AND THIS GOES BACK TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I VALUE WAS SAYING ABOUT THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE GSA'S THE COUNTIES. IS CONSOLIDATING ALL OF THE WATER RELATED PROGRAMS WITH AMONG THE PARK. MY DEPARTMENT- OVERSEAS WELL IN WASTEWATER PERMITTING. LAND USE PLANNING FLOOD REGULATIONS STRONGWATER- MONITORING COMPLIANCE. WATERSHED PLANNING DROUGHT PLANNING. AND I ALSO SERVICE THE MANAGER FOR THE GSA. AS SUCH I'M EXCITED TO SEE THE ASSEMBLY HOLD THIS HEARING REVIEW SEGMENT ALL RIGHT LEGISLATION WAS A BOLD STEP FOR CALIFORNIA BUT CLIMATE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED ENORMOUSLY SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. AS A SCIENCE BASED PROGRAM SAID QUESTION NOT REMAIN STATIC IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE EVALUATED AND REFINED. AS WE LEARN MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW ABOUT WATER WORKS BUT HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BEST MANAGE THE RESOURCE. AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO OFFER A FEW THOUGHTS ABOUT THE FUTURE. EXPECTATIONS FOR GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANNER. BY BOTH THE W. R. EMPIRE PUBLIC IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO BE FRANK YEAH DEFINITELY WATER RELIES ON GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION OF COURSE BUT IT ALSO INVOLVES A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT OUT OF GSA'S CONTROLLER THE COUNTIES CONTROL SUCH AS WEATHER EXTREMES SURFACE WATER DIVERSIONS WHAT IMPACT OF HISTORICAL FLOOD CONTROL AND CHANNEL GEOMORPHOLOGY. THE MANY NATURAL AND HUMAN STRESSORS ON BOTH WATER RESOURCES AND ECOSYSTEMS. COMPLICATE DECISION MAKING ON ISSUES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES. THE SOLUTIONS WILL BE NEVER QUICK NOR EASY OR CHEAP. RIGHT NOW DECISION MAKING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD USE MORE QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ON THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER AND BETTER CHARACTERIZATION OF GROUNDWATER DEPENDENT ECOSYSTEMS ARE STATEWIDE RACES AS WELL AS EXPANDED GUIDANCE FROM STATE AGENCIES ON WHAT THOSE INTERACTIONS MEAN FOR GROUNDWATER PLANNING. BOB THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD- FACTORS OF THE GROUNDWORK TO STAND ONLY PLANNING EFFORT- I THINK NOT ONLY FRUSTRATE OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES AS WELL. AND SO MORE. UNDERSTATEMENT AND GUIDANCE AND AMBASSADOR HELP ALL. WE ALSO WOULD APPRECIATE A GENERAL CLIMATE CHANGE MODEL THAT'S ACCEPTED BY THE STATE- AS ALSO THE MANAGER FROM CLIMATE ACTION PROGRAMME I OULD ECHO THAT THROUGH CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AS WELL- AND ONE THAT CAN BE SCALED DOWN TO LOCAL CONDITIONS- THERE ARE THRESHOLDS FOR CLIMATE ACTION STATEWIDE- THEY'RE DONE ON A LOCAL BASIS I HOPE OUR- AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS CURRENTLY REFINING THEIR SECRET THRESHOLDS. AND THERE'S NO- I'M OTHERS ACCEPTED METHODOLOGY- IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A MORE UNIFORM APPROACH TO GIVE A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE FOUNDATION THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONSTANTLY TAKE CLIMATE ACTION PANNING WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT A POTENTIAL COURT CHALLENGES. AS OREGON SAID THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS OF SIGMA ARE VERY STEEP ESPECIALLY IN THE INITIAL YEARS. THAT'S WERE RAPIDLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF PROGRAMS SUCH AS MONITORING AND DATA COLLECTION AND BASE LINE ANALYSIS. AND COORDINATION NOT RICHARD RICH. MORE STATE FUNDING IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF LOCAL PROGRAMS. AND I LIKE TO ECHO SIERRA ISN'T DOLLARS COMMENTS REGARDING THERE'S ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ESPECIALLY FOR THE UNIQUE ASPECTS OF PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN AS IT RELATES TO SIX. LAST YEAR NOW. HI PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE AS A RESULT THE CURRENT DROUGHT. LARA CONCEPTS OF SUSTAINABLE AND SUSTAINABLE YIELDS ARE APPLIED TO GROUNDWATER BASINS OVER A VERY LONG TIME BUT A FEW MONTHS OR EVEN A FEW YEARS. THE PUBLIC MAY NOT WANT TO WAIT TWENTY YEARS FOR THE PLAN TO TAKE AFFECTED THEIR WELLS ARE RUNNING DRY THIS SUMMER. THIS IS WHERE THE TO PUT THIS ORDER HAS TO BE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. THE COUNTY ONLY TO TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO ALLEVIATE RESIDENTS COMMUNITIES AND PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS. IN ORDER RUNNING OUT OF WATER THAT'S MANDATED THE TROUT WATERS THE PROBLEM WATER SHORTAGE TASK FORCE. THE SAME TIME THE GSA NEEDS TO ACT RESPONSIBLY TAKING THE TIME IT NEEDS TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS TO AVOID THE UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS. OF GROUNDWATER EFFECT- SOLUTION TO GET ARE GOING TO COME QUICKLY. THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO IN THE INTERIM WHILE WE ARE TAKING THE RESPONSIBLE STEP TO STARTING AND COMING UP WITH SOLUTIONS FOR THE LAW IN THE LONG TERM. THAT WILL WHAT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND LIKE THE OTHERS ON THE BILL CREDIT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT THE ATTORNEYS MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MR MORRISON OF YOUR GREAT WORDS AND LOVE ALL OF THE- THINGS THAT YOU'RE DOING IN NAPA COUNTY WE APPRECIATE IT. OKAY ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE- NO I HAVE NO QUESTIONS NO ONE FROM THE AUDIENCE. OKAY I THINK THAT EUROPE FOR. YEAH. AWESOME I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT- AGUIAR-CURRY SAID WHICH IS THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE PRESENTERS HERE TODAY WHO WERE SO HELPFUL. IN HELPING US REALLY THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT MAN WHERE WE NEED TO GO TO GET TO SUSTAINABILITY WE WILL NOW MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE DOING THAT AND IF THEY'RE INDIVIDUALS THE ROOM. WANT TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT WILL START THERE AND THEN WE WILL GO TO THE PHONE SO IF YOU'RE WAITING TO CALL IN TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT NOW WOULD BE A GREAT TIME. TO USE THE PHONE LINES. WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT PUBLIC COMMENT TO ONE MINUTE SO WE HAVE TIME FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S ON THE PHONE AND IN PERSON PLEASE. LOG OUT AS FAST AS I CAN. HELLO ANON WE CAN HEAR YOU YEAH MY NAME IS-STEPHANIE- WHEN YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT THE GROUND WATER AND STUFF I DON'T THINK. ANY OF YOU REALIZE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL GROUND. WATER WATER DISTRICTS OUT THERE THAT BOARD MEMBERS. AND DISTRICT EMPLOYEES ARE BYPASSING THEIR METERS. I HAVE PROOF OF IT OKAY NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO. WHY IS SEVEN POINT SEVEN BILLION GALLONS. WENT OUT TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN TODAY. SECOND OF ALL WE'VE HAD NINE. NINE BILLS PASSED. PROP TWO OH FOUR PROP THIRTEEN PROP TWELVE PROP. PROPOSITION FORTY THIS ADDS UP ALL OF THIS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN OVER THIRTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. WHY ARE WE DEALING WITH THIS NOW WHY DIDN'T WE DEAL WITH IT BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AS OUR POPULATION WAS GROWING. IT MAKES NO SENSE WATER RESOURCES JUST APPOINTED PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT EVEN ELECTED. SO WHY ARE WE ALLOWING THEM TO GUIDE US THROUGH THIS. AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE IT DOESN'T MAKE NO SENSE NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE WATER IS THE MOST PRECIOUS COMMODITY ON EARTH. THANK YOU. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE ROOM SO WE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES. MODERATOR CAN YOU OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. CERTAINLY IF YOU HAVE A PUBLIC COME UP PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD AND THAT'S ONE ZERO WE'LL GO NOW TO LINE SEVENTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD- HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED THE MEMBERS- MESSAGING YOU CAN USE- WITH THE COMMUNITY ALLIANCE WITH FAMILY FARMERS. CAST CAP REPRESENTS OVER EIGHT THOUSAND SMALL AND MID CAL COUNTY FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND HAS WORKED. OVER FORTY YEARS TO PRESERVE FAMILY SCALE AGRICULTURE AND PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY WE WERE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF TAKE MY IT PASSED. AND OR OR DURING THE PROCESS AND WE JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY- AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS HEARING. OUR LOCAL SMALL SCALE AND UNDERSERVED- PRODUCING FARMERS HAVE BEEN. LEFT OUT OF THIS SIGMA CONVERSATION. ABOUT UA ATION BY THE CLEAN WATER ACTION REVIEWED OVER FOURTEEN GSA'S AND ALL FAILED TO INCLUDE SMALL SCALE FARMERS IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS- WITHOUT THEIR VOICES AT THE TABLE. THESE FARMERS WILL NOT BE ALLOCATED THE WATER THEY NEED TO SURVIVE- THIS PROCESS- WE'RE REQUESTING A TEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN SMALL SCALE IN HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED FARMER ENGAGEMENT. TO ASSEMBLY ALLOW FOR THE GREATER PARTICIPATION FOR THESE FARMERS TO PARTICIPATE IN CHIANG MAI. ENERGY ESSAYS AND WE HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU WILL SUPPORT THAT ASKIN AND SUPPORT. SMALL SCALE FARMERS PARTICIPATING IN WILL TAKE MUCH OF A- SURVIVE- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS HEARING AND. AND YOUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU KNOW. MY NEXT COME. THANKS YOU ARE. LINE. SIXTEEN AND- WE GOT A LINE TWENTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. I YOU SOUND FUZZY. YES GOOD. OKAY. WELCOME BACK ACTIVE WATER OR ACTIVE WHAT AT THE BACK DROPS. IF YOU DON'T MENTION JEFF IS ABOUT. OKAY ACTORS WATER BUT WE ARE. IT'S NOT GOODNESS AT THE SOMETHING. KEPT UNDER VERY LITTLE TO NO ATTENTION TO DEVELOP QUALITY AND A LOT. THAT. YEAH NOISE IS GETTING REALLY TO HEAR I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO RELIEVE THAT BUT YOU MAY WANT TO SEND IN YOUR COMMENTS TO MAKE SURE WE CAP IT. YEAH I. OKAY YEAH. BOB. MODERATOR NEXT COMMENT. WE'LL GO TO LINE EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND WHAT WE'RE GONNA LINE FIFTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MEDICARE NUMBERS. AFTER THE PHYSICIAN HOW CAN YOU SPEAK UP JUST A LITTLE BIT YOUR LITTLE HEART I. YEAH. IS THAT BETTER THAT'S MUCH BETTER. OKAY GREAT- CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES JUST ONE AT- FIRST THANK DAY COMMITTEE CHAIRS FOR DECIDING TO HOLD ITS HEARING AND- THEY COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR WORK DONE IN ORGANIZING THE HEARING- AWFUL NUMBER AGENCIES ARE PARTICIPATING THE GFA EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE AND HARPER STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE LOCAL AGENCY EFFORTS RELATED TO SIGMA. ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONAL PILLARS THE TAKE MY IS THAT SUSTAINABILITY IS BEST TO CHEAP LOCALLY WE APPRECIATE THAT D. W. ARE IN THE STATE WATER BOARD STAFF FOR CONTINUING TO SUPPORT STATEMENT HAS-LOCALLY DRIVEN PLANNING PROCESS AND FOR REINFORCING THAT LOCAL MANAGEMENT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO KEEP GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY- WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF TAKE MY INCLUDING A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR. FOR SEGMENTAL MEDITATION- LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ALSO CREATED THE MULTI BENEFIT LAND REPURPOSE PROGRAM WHICH WILL HELP EASE THE NECESSARY TRANSITION SOME MUST UNDERGO TO CHEAT GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY GOALS ESTABLISHED IN TECHNO WALTER PROMOTING OTHER COMMUNITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. CONTINUING TO RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES STRATEGIES AND SOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN DEALING WITH SOCIO ECONOMIC CHALLENGE CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY RESULT FROM CHANGES IN GROUNDWATER SUCH AS PLANNED CALLING WILL BE CRITICAL PARKLET COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE STATE ELECT- AND AGRICULTURAL WATER USERS GROWERS LANDOWNERS- ENVIRONMENTAL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY INTEREST MATTER STAKEHOLDERS. ON IT SHE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY. IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MODERATOR NECK SUMMER. WELCOME A LINE PLEASE AHEAD. HI MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBER MARK ON OF WATERFOWL THE TWO BATES AND WEBER LOS. I'M GLAD THAT THE- IMPACTS THE MAN'S WETLANDS WERE MENTIONED AGAINST SIGMA IT DEFINITELY THREATENING TO REDUCE MANAGED WETLAND HABITAT THAT PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY DEPENDENT UPON GROUNDWATER IT'S MOST NOTABLY INCLUDES WETLANDS AND THE TULARE BASIN AND GRASSLANDS AREA SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AS WELL AS THE WETLANDS OF- THE BUTTE. VALLEY AND SISKIYOU COUNTY. BUT FISH WILDLIFE OWNS WHAT BY AS WE MENTIONED- EARLIER MAY ARE PRIME ON AND UNDER SKATER FEDERAL WATERFOWL HABITAT AGREEMENT. THAT ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES LANDOWNERS TO INTENSELY MANAGE THEM ON ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AS ALL OF YOU- NO WE'VE LOST OVER WETLANDS IN THE ONE EACH REMAINING PROVIDES CRITICAL HABITAT FOR WATERFOWL AND MANY THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES AS WELL AS RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC. THE STATE HAS ENTERED INTO REGIONAL PLANS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND NONPROFIT CONSERVATION GROUPS TO INCREASE WETLAND ACREAGE- BUT ALSO HAS A NO NET LOSS POLICY ON WHAT WENT INCONSISTENT WITH THE STATE POLICY- THE LOCAL GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN THUS FAR ARE NOT FULLY CONSIDERING IMPACTS TO MANAGE WETLANDS AND ARE ESSENTIALLY TREATING THEM THE SAME AS ANY OTHER LAND USE. WHAT WHEN LANDOWNERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD THE HIGHER MANAGEMENT COSTS WILL BE FORCED TO PROVIDE MUCH FOR QUALITY HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE OR DRY AFTER WET WILLIE DO TIRE LEAF CHANGES TO SIGMA IMPLEMENTATION OR THE LAW ARE NOT MADE AND- SO I WANT TO POINT THAT OUT AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AND- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO COMMENT. THANK YOU. NEXT WEEK NOT A LINE EIGHTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING CHAIRWOMAN POWER QUE HAN AND AGUILAR CURRY THIS IS LUCAS FRERICHS ON BEHALF OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY I'D LIKE TO OFFER A FEW COMMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS FROM NATURE CONSERVANCY WITH REGARD TO IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA AND A VARIETY OF GSA THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN CONTRAST TO THE OVER DRAFTED TWENTY TWENTY BASINS MANY TWENTY TWENTY TWO GSA THEY'RE CLAIMING THAT THEIR BASES ARE SUSTAINABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE WITHIN THE SUSTAINABLE YIELD THAT AS A RESULT MANY BASINS ARE NOT ACTIVELY PURSUING PROJECT MANAGEMENT ACTIONS ON THEIR PLAN UNTIL THE GROUND WATER CONDITIONS IN THE BASIN DETERIORATE FURTHER TRIGGERING ACTIONS- ADDITIONALLY MOST YES PEAS ARE USING HISTORIC SUSTAINABLE YIELD INSTEAD OF PROJECTED SUSTAINABLE YIELD WHEN ESTABLISHING SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT CRITERIA AND PRODUCT MANAGEMENT ACTIONS- JUST ANIMAL MANAGEMENT. REMAINS MORE FAVORABLE DEMAND. MANAGEMENT AS WELL. THERE'S ALSO BEEN VERY LITTLE TO NO CONSIDER.

ONE THIRTY NINETY AND- GROUNDWATER COMMITTEE YOU WE CAN YOU- EXCELLENT READING FUHRMAN APRIL TWENTY SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA GLOBE ARTICLE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HASN'T SIGNIFICANTLY INVESTED IN WATER STORAGE SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN JERRY BROWN WAS GOVERNOR THE FIRST TIME AROUND. THIS IS AN ERA OF LIMITS AND WE ALL HAD BETTER GET USED TO IT BROWN SAID UPON BEING ELECTED GOVERNOR IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE EMBRACING THE SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL WAY OF THINKING. SINCE THEN CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION HAS DOUBLED AS HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL DEMANDS AND MORE THAN 50% OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES ARE ALLOWED TO FLOW OUT TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. OUT OUT THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN RATHER THAN BUILD A DESPERATELY NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO COLLECT AND STORE WATER DURING THE WET YEARS GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED INTO LAW. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A NEW WATER CONSERVATION ACT THAT WILL LIMIT EACH CITIZEN TO JUST FIFTY TO FIFTY FIVE GALLONS OF WATER PER DAY BY TWENTY FIFTY. THE TRUTH IS THAT 50% OF CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY ALREADY GOES TOWARDS ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES OF THE REST OF THE WATER ONLY ABOUT 10% GOES TO URBAN USES FOR HOMES AND BUSINESSES. AND 40% IS USED BY AGRICULTURE A FULL 50% OF THE STATE'S WATER IS USED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES. SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE APPROVED EIGHT WATER BOND TOTALING MORE THAN THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND APPROVED THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO MORE DAM. YEAH ON MAY NINTH TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. JERRY BROWN SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND WE CAN MAKE WATER STATION A WAY OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH- WHAT GATES FOR FUNERAL. ON TO THE NEXT CALLER. THANK YOU- MORE CALMER BECAUSE AND THEN. NINE AND CURRENTLY NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU MODERATOR THAT THEN WE WILL CONCLUDE THE HEARING THANK YOU. HELLO.
