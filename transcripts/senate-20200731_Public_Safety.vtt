THAT FOLKS FIT THEY DO GET OUT

00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:26.311
OF. AND I THINK THIS IS A- THE

00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:28.046
TO MOVE FROM XIN THAT THE BAY

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:29.781
WAY TO KILL PEOPLE IS TO

00:32:29.847 --> 00:32:32.050
INCARCERATE THEM. FOR

00:32:32.116 --> 00:32:34.352
PUNISHMENT MOST PEOPLE IN ARE

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:35.953
THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.123
PROBLEM AND IF WE ARE WILLING

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:40.525

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:43.628
RESPOND OF IT. IS THE PROBLEM

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:46.464
CORRECT. AN THE I AM REMINDED

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:47.598
OF AN EXPERIENCE COUPLE YEARS

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:52.503
AGO. THE SENATE TOOK A TRIP TO

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.238
PORTUGAL AND SPAIN. AND

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:58.676
PORTUGAL SORT OF LIKE KENTUCKY

00:32:58.743 --> 00:32:59.310
RECOGNIZED THAT TO SIMPLY

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:01.512
INCARCERATE PEOPLE WAS NOT

00:33:01.579 --> 00:33:04.048
SOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS. AND SO

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.017
THEY LOOKED AT A LOT OF THEIR

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.219
ADDICTION ISSUES AS A HEALTH

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:09.887
ISSUE NOT A CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:13.324
ISSUE. AND THEY REDUCED THEIR

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:17.829
RATE OF. IT WILL NOT CHEST OF

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:19.364
CONVICTION BUT AND

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.433
INCARCERATION BUT OF ACTUAL-

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.503
ADDICTION. BECAUSE THE TREATED

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:29.273
THE PROBLEM. AND IT IT WAS

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.241
REALLY QUITE AN EYE OPENING

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:32.210
EXPERIENCE THE FACT THAT OUR

00:33:32.276 --> 00:33:33.811
FRIENDS IN KENTUCKY ARE WAY

00:33:33.878 --> 00:33:35.780
AHEAD OF US ON THIS KENTUCKY

00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:38.549
ISN'T KNOWN AS FAR AS I KNOW IS

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:43.221
A- SORT OF A TOUCHY FEELY

00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:44.422
GRANOLA TYPE PLAY IT'S PRETTY

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:48.626
HARD CO. IN MANY BUT- WE SHOULD

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:50.128
BE LOOKING AT THIS AND THE

00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:52.430
REASON I'M SPEAKING MADAM CHAIR

00:33:52.497 --> 00:33:56.134
IN. YOU NEED. TO REPORT OUR

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.402
TION OF WHAT TO ACRONYM JUSTICE

00:33:57.468 --> 00:33:59.937
IS AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE

00:34:00.004 --> 00:34:02.840
PEOPLE WHOSE BEHAVIOR JUSTIFIED

00:34:02.907 --> 00:34:05.076
INCARCERATIONS BUT WHILE THEY

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:06.577
WERE DATING THE WORK ON TRYING

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:09.347
TO HELP THEM CHANGE THEIR

00:34:09.414 --> 00:34:12.583
BEHAVIOR. ADDICTION IS A- BY

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.786
ALLOWING US TO GIVE INCENTIVES

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:18.189
TO PEOPLE. TO TRY TO THAT

00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:23.428
BEHAVIOR TO OVERCOME. THEIR

00:34:23.494 --> 00:34:24.028
ADDICTION TO HELP THEM DO THAT

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:24.595
SO THE WHEN THEY GET OUT THE

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:26.531
KNOCK IN RECIDIVIST TODAY ARE

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:28.299

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:29.867
ABILITY TO TURN THEIR LIVES

00:34:29.934 --> 00:34:34.539
AROUND IS I THINK AN OVERDUE

00:34:34.605 --> 00:34:36.507
CONCEPT THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA'S.

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:39.010
HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE GAME ON

00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:41.312

DAMAGING BUT IS INCARCERATION.

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:25.299
IT STILL IS INCREDIBLY

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:27.501

PRESSURES TO COMPLY WITH THESE

01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:41.442

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:46.780
QUICKLY AFTER THEY ARE RELEASED

SHE IS THAT. THE LENGTH OF

THERE'S NO ACTIVE SUPERVISION

01:40:09.103 --> 01:40:10.137
AND THEN OF COURSE YOU GET A

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:11.905

AND EFFECTIVELY SO THAT IT DOES

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:38.792
WORK SO THAT WE DON'TFIND

01:41:38.859 --> 01:41:41.295
OURSELVES. FEELING THAT WE HAVE

01:41:41.361 --> 01:41:43.263
TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING THAT-

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:45.098

MITCHELL BEFORE I GIVE YOU THE

01:43:39.179 --> 01:43:41.748
FLOOR TO CLOSE I WOULD SAY THAT

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:45.452
EVEN WITH GREAT PROGRAMMING.

01:43:45.519 --> 01:43:48.288
LONG BLANKS APPROPRIATION TO

01:43:48.355 --> 01:43:51.592
NOT SERVE A PERSON SUCCESSFUL

01:43:51.658 --> 01:43:53.560
REHABILITATION BECAUSE OF THE

01:43:53.627 --> 01:43:55.295
AMOUNT OF LIMITATIONS THAT ARE

01:43:55.362 --> 01:43:57.831
PUT ON YOU WHEN YOU WERE UNDER

01:43:57.898 --> 01:44:02.936
PROBATION AND SO TO SUCCEED IN

01:44:03.003 --> 01:44:05.906
BACK FULLY IN RE ENTRY YOU NEED

01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:08.475

WHILE YOU'RE UNDER INFORMATION

01:44:15.115 --> 01:44:15.682
IS CONSIDERED SUPERVISION THAT

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:16.183
WHILE YOU'RE UNDERSERVED

01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:18.118

PROHIBITED FROM SO JUST BY ITS

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:25.659
VERY NATURE EVEN UNDER THE BEST

01:44:25.726 --> 01:44:26.593
TYPE OF PROGRAM CAN GRAY IN A

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.261
PERSON'S ABILITY TO IN FACT

01:44:28.328 --> 01:44:30.697

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:33.300
IT BEFORE INTENTION IS TO HAVE

01:44:33.367 --> 01:44:36.036

DIALOGUE AND LET ME START BY

01:44:46.146 --> 01:44:48.148
SAYING THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD

01:44:48.215 --> 01:44:52.486
ABSOLUTELY AGREE. PROBATION

01:44:52.552 --> 01:44:53.687
DONE WELL IS AN APT ENTERED

01:44:53.754 --> 01:44:56.456
COMPONENT EVERY ENTRY- SHE

01:44:56.523 --> 01:45:00.060
WOULD AGREE- SENATOR JACK FROM

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:03.163
THAT IT'S AN ABSOLUTE ASSET.

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.731
AND I AND I'M SURE THEY SHOULD

01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:07.000
BE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THE

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:08.769
FUNDING ISSUE AT A LATER DATE

01:45:08.835 --> 01:45:11.405
BUT LET'S BE CLEAR FOR EXAMPLE-

01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:14.374
YOU KNOW IN LA COUNTY THE SB

01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:14.908
SIX SEVENTY EIGHT DOLLARS

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:18.178
HAVEN'T ALL BEEN SPENT AND SO

01:45:18.245 --> 01:45:18.679
PROBABLY IS AN IMPORTANT

01:45:18.745 --> 01:45:19.613
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THAT FOR

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.248
THE MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:22.649
ALL COUNTIES ARE SPENDING THOSE

01:45:22.716 --> 01:45:24.685
DOLLARS ON THE FRONT IN AN

01:45:24.751 --> 01:45:28.655
EFFECTIVE WAY. ABSOLUTELY NOT

01:45:28.722 --> 01:45:31.358
HER DESIRE TO REDUCE FUNDING-

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:33.293
SHE WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.162
WITH THE CHIEF PROBATION

01:45:35.228 --> 01:45:36.163
OFFICER WHO SPOKE OPPOSITION

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:38.565
THAT IT IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:41.234
INCARCERATION BUT THAT IS THEIR

01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:43.036
MISSION BUT IF THAT'S THEIR

01:45:43.103 --> 01:45:44.971
MISSION WHY ARE WE ALLOWING

01:45:45.038 --> 01:45:46.306
MINOR TECHNICAL VIOLATE

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:48.608
VIOLATIONS TO THE ONLY PEOPLE

01:45:48.675 --> 01:45:51.178
BACK TO INCARCERATION I THINK

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:51.978
THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MEASURE

01:45:52.045 --> 01:45:54.114
IS TO BE TRUE TO THE TRUE

01:45:54.181 --> 01:45:56.817
MISSION AND INTENT AND DESIGN

01:45:56.883 --> 01:45:58.485
OF WHAT PROBATION IS ALL ABOUT.

01:45:58.552 --> 01:46:00.220
IN RESPONSE TO THE OPPOSITION

01:46:00.287 --> 01:46:01.288
FROM THE I'M DIFFICULT

01:46:01.354 --> 01:46:03.623
TRANSOCEAN THAT'S TRUE AND

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:06.493
JUDGE CAN ORDER A TWO YEAR OR

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.528
LESS PROBATION PERIOD THE POINT

01:46:08.595 --> 01:46:10.363
OF THIS BILL IS TO REDESIGN

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:13.300
PROBATION SO THOSE TWO YEARS

01:46:13.366 --> 01:46:15.102
ARE SPENT. IN A MEANINGFUL AND

01:46:15.168 --> 01:46:17.137
PROFOUND WAY A JUDGE COULD

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:18.004
ORDER TWO YEARS PROBATION NOW

01:46:18.071 --> 01:46:18.672
BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS

01:46:18.739 --> 01:46:21.007
BILL IS TO FRONT LOAD ALL OF

01:46:21.074 --> 01:46:22.876
THOSE RESOURCES AND SERVICES.

01:46:22.943 --> 01:46:25.178
SAW THOSE TWO YEARS. CAN BE THE

01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:27.881
MOST IMPACTFUL THEY ALSO ARGUE

01:46:27.948 --> 01:46:32.185
THAT A- A PERSON CAN. IF THEY

01:46:32.252 --> 01:46:32.986
FINISH WITH ALL OF THEIR

01:46:33.053 --> 01:46:35.422
PROGRAMMING THEY CAN GO BACK TO

01:46:35.489 --> 01:46:36.890
THE COURTS TO ASK FOR

01:46:36.957 --> 01:46:38.959
TERMINATION. I WOULD QUESTION

01:46:39.025 --> 01:46:40.026
THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THAT

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:42.295
HAPPENS KNOWING THAT HOW BACKED

01:46:42.362 --> 01:46:43.997
UP OUR COURT DOCKETS ARE AND I

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:45.599
WONDER IF PROBATIONERS EVEN

01:46:45.665 --> 01:46:47.167
NOW. THAT THEY HAVE THE

01:46:47.234 --> 01:46:49.903
OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK AND TRY

01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:50.804
TO SHORTEN YOUR TERM AGAIN IT

01:46:50.871 --> 01:46:52.272
MISSES THE POINT THE WHOLE

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:54.608
POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO FRONT

01:46:54.674 --> 01:46:56.009
LOAD THE RESOURCES FULL FULL

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:57.477
FULL FIRST TWO YEARS OUR MOST

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:58.945
IMPORTANT. I AGREE WITH YOU

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:00.347
SAID IN A MORE LIKE I DO THINK

01:47:00.413 --> 01:47:01.248
IT'S AN INTEREST INTERESTING

01:47:01.314 --> 01:47:03.583
THAT THE HOUSE IS DIVIDED. ON

01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:05.852

WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:47:27.908 --> 01:47:31.444
