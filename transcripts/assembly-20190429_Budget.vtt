CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE STATES

00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:44.175
THAT IS MOST PRONE TO NATURAL

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:45.243
DISASTERS.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.977
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.412
CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED ROUGHLY

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:48.813

00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:17.275

AS WE KNOW IN THE IMMEDIATE

00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:25.784
AFTERMATH OF THE NATURAL

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.286
DISASTERS QUICK RESPONSE IS

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:30.722

NO FORMAL POSITION ON THIS BILL

00:27:13.631 --> 00:27:14.466
WE'RE STILL EVALUATING THE

00:27:14.532 --> 00:27:15.333
POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THIS

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.267
PROPOSAL.

WE'D LIKE TO RETAIN AS MUCH

00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:21.873
FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AS

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:22.874
POSSIBLE.

I WANTED DRESSING NEEDS FOR THE

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:25.543
STATE CREATING A SEPARATE

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.513
RESERVE FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.215
LIKELY REDUCES THAT FLEXIBILITY --

00:27:30.281 --> 00:27:31.916
BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN

00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:33.585
FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THIS

00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:36.321
ISSUE AS PART OF THE ONGOING

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:39.991

CAN.

00:27:46.464 --> 00:27:47.532
WHAT YOU SAID WHAT PART OF

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:48.566
FINANCES SAID THERE I WASN'T

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:54.539
RESERVE ACCOUNT -- SO WHERE IS

00:27:54.606 --> 00:27:56.141
THE FRONT WEARS A FUNDING

00:27:56.207 --> 00:28:00.045
EXPECTED TO COME FROM FROM.

00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:02.347
EXIST REVENUE I MEAN WHERE WHERE

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:04.682
WE WERE HAPPY IT SAYS THERE'S NO

00:28:04.749 --> 00:28:06.117
THERE THE BILL WILL HAVE NO COST

00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:06.985
BUT WE HAVE.

00:28:07.052 --> 00:28:10.021
SO WE CREATE A FUND WHERE DOES

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:12.791
THE MONEY COME FROM SO.

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:13.825
THE SERVER WOULD THEM THE TIMING

00:28:13.892 --> 00:28:14.292
AND AMOUNT OF FEDERAL

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:15.560
REIMBURSEMENTS AS PART OF THE

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:16.494
REASON FOR THE RESERVE THIS

00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:17.328
THERE SO THAT WE HAVE AMPLE TIME

00:28:17.395 --> 00:28:18.930
TO GET THAT REIMBURSEMENT BACK

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:20.098
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:28:20.165 --> 00:28:22.667
THEY WOULD THEN GO INTO THIS

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:27.005
THIS A RESERVE.

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:28.173
HEAR ME IT LOOKS LIKE THERE

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:29.040
WOULD HAVE NEED TO BE SOME SEED

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:29.974
MONEY PUT INTO THE ACCOUNT

00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:30.975
EITHER FROM THE GENERAL FUND OR

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:33.078
FROM SOME OTHER FUNDING SOURCES

00:28:33.144 --> 00:28:34.112
TO GET IT.

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:36.247
YOU KNOW -- FILLED UP TO TWO IS

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:37.982
A STARTING POINT.

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.918
SO IS ANYBODY GIVEN A THOUGHT TO

00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:44.189
WHAT THAT NUMBER MIGHT BE.

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:45.223
FINANCES NOT -- DETERMINE ANY

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.659
SPECIFIC A THRESHOLD DOLLAR

00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:56.768
AMOUNT.

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:59.070
DESCRIPTION I WILL I WILL TRY MY

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:01.606
BEST.

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:05.376
I'VE ALWAYS REYES LARYNGITIS

00:29:05.443 --> 00:29:09.547
YEAH.

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:13.151
THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM -- BUT AS

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:16.287
WE WE ALREADY REIMBURSE AND WE

00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:17.956
ALREADY ADDRESS EMERGENCY

00:29:18.022 --> 00:29:20.358
SITUATIONS WELL BUT IT'S OUT OF

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.026
THE IF I UNDERSTAND IT QUICKLY.

00:29:22.093 --> 00:29:25.430
THE MAIN RESERVE ACCOUNTS.

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:28.566
AND WHAT THIS WOULD SIMPLY DO IS

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:31.102
CREATE A A WAY THAT WE CAN

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:33.404
BETTER TRACK.

00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:37.242
FEMALE -- PAYMENTS THE TIMING OF

00:29:37.308 --> 00:29:37.942
IT AND THEN ALSO BEGAN TO

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:40.178
UNDERSTAND WHAT SHOULD BE PUT

00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:42.247
AWAY. FOR EMERGENCIES IN THE

00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:43.047
FUTURE.

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:45.316
BASED ON HEALTH REIMBURSEMENTS

00:29:45.383 --> 00:29:47.752
COME IN AND HOW THEY'RE

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.521
DISPERSED.

00:29:49.587 --> 00:29:51.656
SO IT'S REALLY SERVING MORE TO

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:54.392
ADD GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:59.097
TRACKING -- DATA AS FAR AS WE

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:07.205
SEATS AND DISBURSEMENTS.

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:12.043
THANK YOU -- MISTER WILL.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:17.382
TAKE IT WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE THE

00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:18.850
ALSO FOR YOU AND STATE LAW SAYS

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:20.318
THAT WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE SFU

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:21.486
GETS ABOVE A CERTAIN POINT.

00:30:21.553 --> 00:30:22.687
THAT TRIGGERS AN AUTOMATIC ONE

00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:23.555
QUARTER PERCENTAGE POINT

00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:25.056
REDUCTION IN THE STATEWIDE SALES

00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:27.058
TAX SO EVERY TIME SOMEONE

00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:27.959
PROPOSES CREATING A NEW RESERVE

00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:29.761
ACCOUNT WHAT I THINK IN MY MIND

00:30:29.827 --> 00:30:31.563
IS THAT DELAYS THE DATE WHEN

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:32.163
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.765
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA A

00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:35.166
REDUCTION ON THEIR SALES TAX AND

00:30:35.233 --> 00:30:36.000
THIS IS A NEW YEAR WHEN WE HAVE

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:37.902
A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:39.704
SURPLUS I THINK THAT WE ARE WE

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:41.472
SHOULD HAVE LET THE SFU EXCEED

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:42.440
THAT AMOUNT.

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:44.876
BOB HOWEVER IN THIS CASE I'M

00:30:44.943 --> 00:30:45.877
GONNA GO AGAINST THAT.

00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:47.278
WHAT WHAT I DO REGULARLY AND

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:48.613
VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.148
THINK THAT YOU BRING SOME

00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:51.883
EXCELLENT POINTS UP WHEN YOU

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:54.085
TALK ABOUT THE STATE'S NEED --

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:57.388
FOR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS THESE

00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:59.891
ARE TRULY -- AYE AYE --

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:01.025
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR WHICH WE NEED

00:31:01.092 --> 00:31:02.260
TO HAVE A SEPARATE RESERVE

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:04.162
ACCOUNT ACCOUNT SET ASIDE AND

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:04.796
THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY CAN'T

00:31:04.862 --> 00:31:06.264
FORESEE WHEN THE NEED MIGHT

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:07.365
OCCUR THAT WE NEED TO TAP INTO

00:31:07.432 --> 00:31:08.299
THAT SO.

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:09.300
I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:10.268
TODAY BUT I I'D LIKE TO

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:11.669
ENCOURAGE US TO TO THINK

00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:12.937
CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:13.905
WITH THE SEPARATE RESERVE

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:15.006
ACCOUNTS BECAUSE I REALLY THINK

00:31:15.073 --> 00:31:15.907
THAT.

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:17.475
THE PEOPLE OF CAL CALIFORNIA

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:20.645
DESERVE THAT ONE QUARTER PERCENT

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:21.212
REDUCTION IN THEIR SALES TAX

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:23.748
RATE.

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:25.750
THANK YOU IT JUST ADDITIONAL

00:31:25.817 --> 00:31:27.385
CLARIFYING DOCTOR WHICH QUESTION

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:27.552
SO.

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:28.886
THIS ACCOUNT PART THE REASON FOR

00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:29.921
THIS ACCOUNT IS.

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:31.656
BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:32.290
BEEN NUMEROUS EXPENDITURES ALL

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:33.358
COME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES.

00:31:33.424 --> 00:31:34.792
THIS WOULD REALLY ALLOW US TO

00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:37.095
HAVE A MUCH CLEARER COUNTING ON

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:38.463
WHAT'S BEING SPENT.

00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:40.465
ON SPECIFIC DISASTERS WHAT IS

00:31:40.531 --> 00:31:42.433
ALSO OCCURRING IN WHERE THAT

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.968
MONEY IS COMING FROM BECAUSE

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:45.003
RIGHT NOW IT'S SORT OF A A

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:47.171
MISHMASH OF PLACES DEPENDING ON

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:47.872
THOSE DEPARTMENTS.

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:49.574
IT WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY BECAUSE

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:50.942
FRANKLY THESE DISASTERS WERE ONE

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:53.044
OFFS AND THEY WERE INFREQUENT

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:54.679
NOW THAT THEY'VE BECOME

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:56.080
UNFORTUNATELY ALMOST AN ANNUAL

00:31:56.147 --> 00:31:57.382
OCCURRENCE.

00:31:57.448 --> 00:31:59.017
WE WE FIND THE NEED.

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:00.652
TO TAKE A MUCH CLOSER LOOK HAVE

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:03.254
A MUCH MORE SET GUIDELINE OF

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:04.956
PRINCIPLES AND AND PERHAPS A

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:05.623
SEPARATE COUNTY SO WE'RE REALLY

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:06.958
UNDERSTAND IT MAKE SURE THE

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:08.059
MONEY IS ACTUALLY.

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:20.498
OF OUR BUDGETING PROCESS AND OR

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:21.699
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SINCE THEY

WERE FORMED IN NINETEEN FORTY

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:24.335
NINE OF COURSE THEIR FORM. TO BE

FORTY PASSED WHICH PASSED STRICT

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.512
REGULATION AND CAPS ON

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:35.513
LEGISLATIVE SPENDING

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.848
UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGISLATIVE

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:38.583
ANALYST'S OFFICE IS INCLUDED

00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:39.450
UNDERNEATH THE PROP ONE FORTY

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:40.118
CAPS.

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:42.186
PRIOR TO NINETEEN NINETY THE LA --

00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:44.122
DID ANALYSIS NOT JUST OF THE

00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:45.490
BUDGET BUT OF EVERY SINGLE BILL

00:33:45.556 --> 00:33:46.324
THAT WENT BEFORE THE

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:47.558
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THAT

00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:49.193
ANALYSIS WAS ARE NOT ONLY TIMELY

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.829
BUT ALSO VERY HELPFUL IN EATING

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:52.864
THE LEGISLATURE.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.232
IN NAVIGATING THE THE MAZE OF

00:33:54.298 --> 00:33:55.633
ALL THOSE BILLS AGO BEFORE

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.069
APPROPRIATIONS AFTER PROP ONE

00:33:58.136 --> 00:33:59.170
FORTY PASSED THE STAFF OF THE LA --

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:02.039
WAS CUT BY OVER 60% AND IT IS

00:34:02.106 --> 00:34:03.174
NEVER BEEN RESTORED TO GIVE YOU

00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:04.742
AN IDEA OF THE LA -- CURRENTLY

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:06.778
HAS ABOUT AS MUCH STAFF AS THEY

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:09.213
HAD IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AND

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.515
THE STATE BUDGET AND THE

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:11.482
ACCOMPANYING PROGRAMS HAVE

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:14.919
INCREASED OVER 5000% SINCE THEM.

00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:16.754
SO THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT

00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:18.689
ACA ELEVEN WOULD REMOVE THE LA --

00:34:18.756 --> 00:34:20.691
FROM UNDERNEATH THE PROP ONE

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:22.059
FORTY CAPS A ON THE ALLOW US TO

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:25.062
BE TO RESTORE THE LA -- TO

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:25.663
CLOSER TO WHAT THEIR ORIGINAL

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.497
MISSION WAS.

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.065
NORMALLY I'M A SMALL GOVERNMENT

00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:29.467
PERSON NORMALLY I'M NOT IN FAVOR

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:30.968
OF EXPANDING ANY DEPARTMENT OF

00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:31.903
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IN

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:33.304
THIS CASE I MAKE AN EXCEPTION

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:35.139
BECAUSE THE ONLY I WAS SUPPOSED

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:36.908
TO BE THE FISCAL WATCHDOG. FOR

00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:37.975
NOT ONLY STATE SPENDING WITH THE

00:34:38.042 --> 00:34:39.811
LEGISLATURE IN THAT DEPARTMENT I

00:34:39.877 --> 00:34:41.879
WANT TO HAVE AS MANY STAFF AS

00:34:41.946 --> 00:34:43.347
THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB SO.

00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:45.016
I I THINK THIS IS A GREAT THING

00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:46.417
FOR NOT ONLY OUR FISCAL

00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:48.119
CONSERVANCY BUT ALSO THE PEOPLE

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:49.420

FUND COST PRESSURES THAT COULD

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.435
EXIST IF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:05.803
IS CARVED OUT.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:07.305
OF THE LEGISLATURE'S SPENDING

00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:09.173
AND THEN THERE WOULD BE COST FOR

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.541
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO PUT

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:11.776

YOU AND I HAVE THIS --

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:07.498
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL A

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:08.566
MONTH OR SO AGO AND I STILL HAVE

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:10.301
THE SAME CONCERNS YOU YOU SEEK

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:11.002
TO REMOVE.

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:13.804
THE SPENDING CAP FOR THE LA YEAH

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:15.740
THAT'S WHAT THIS WOULD DO RIGHT.

00:36:15.806 --> 00:36:17.174
NOT QUITE WHAT I PROPOSE YOU TO

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:19.310
DO IS TO MOVE THE LA -- OUT FROM

00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:20.745
THE EXISTING PROP ONE FORTY

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:22.780
SPENDING CAP FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:24.248
SO THAT THAT CAP WOULD STILL

00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:25.449
EXIST FOR THE LEGISLATURE BUT

00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:27.151
THE LA -- WOULD EXIST

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:28.352
INDEPENDENTLY OF THAT CAP AND

00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:30.855
THEY DON'T GET BUDGET EVERY YEAR

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:31.689
AS EVERY OTHER DEPARTMENT THIS

00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:33.224
THERE'S NO CAP PLACED ON HOW

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:35.059
MUCH THEY COULD RECEIVE IS NOT

00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:35.993
SPECIFICALLY IN THE LA ALBEIT AN

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.298
ITEM FOR NEGOTIATION EACH YEAR

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:42.567
WHEN WE SAT THERE BUDGET.

00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:44.735
AND SO -- PROP ONE FIFTY EIGHT

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:46.804
WHICH WAS PRESENTED TO THE

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:50.575
VOTERS IN -- NINETEEN NINETEEN

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:52.176
NINETY TWO YEAH -- WAS REJECTED

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:52.810
BY THE VOTERS THEY DIDN'T WANT

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:53.477
TO DO THE VERY THING THAT YOU'RE

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.146
PROPOSING THAT WE SHOULD DO

00:36:55.212 --> 00:36:56.013
TODAY BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:56.814
COMFORTABLE.

00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:58.583
WITH -- ALLOWING THEM TO BE

00:36:58.649 --> 00:37:00.451
SEPARATED AND ALSO NOT TO HAVE

00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:03.321
ANY SORT OF CONSTITUTIONAL CAP

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:08.059
SO I'M JUST WONDERING -- I GUESS.

00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:08.659
YOU ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION

00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:09.927
THAT THE VOTERS WOULD FEEL

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:11.662
DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME I AM AT

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.564
AGE IS ACTUALLY QUESTION BECAUSE

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:14.966
AS YOU SAY PROP ONE FIFTY EIGHT

00:37:15.032 --> 00:37:17.134
WAS REJECTED BY THE VOTERS

00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:18.002
NINETEEN NINETY TWO BUT I THINK

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:19.537
THAT THE LA -- GOT CAUGHT UP IN

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:22.573
THE BACKLASH OF VOTER OPINION

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.608
AGAINST THE LEGISLATURE THE

00:37:23.674 --> 00:37:24.709
LEGISLATURE WAS VERY UNPOPULAR

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:26.711
WITH VOTERS AT THAT TIME AND

00:37:26.777 --> 00:37:32.183
THAT'S WHY PROP ONE FORTY WAS.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.920
ONE YOU SEEN NOW.

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:38.022
I PLEAD THE FIFTH.

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:38.556
BUT I I DO THINK THAT THE

00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:39.190
SETTLEMENT IS IS VERY DIFFERENT

00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:39.824
NOW THE POLITICAL CLIMATE VERY

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:40.725
DIFFERENT NOW THAN IT WAS IN

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:41.826
NINETEEN NINETY TWO I ALSO THINK

00:37:41.892 --> 00:37:42.426
THAT.

00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:43.928
WE DIDN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF

00:37:43.995 --> 00:37:45.496
ARTICULATING THE CASE FOR WHY

00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:47.131
THE ONLY -- EXISTS AND WHY WE

00:37:47.198 --> 00:37:49.400
NEED A STRONG AND INDEPENDENT LA --

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:50.401
TO COUNTERBALANCE THE DEPARTMENT

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:52.036
OF FINANCE AND HOW THE LA --

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:53.537
ACTUALLY HELPS TO SAVE TAXPAYER

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:55.673
MONEY SO -- I WOULD ARGUE THAT A

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.074
DOLLAR INVESTED NEARLY DO YOU

00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:58.843
YIELDS MANY DOLLARS BACK AND

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:01.946
TAXPAYER SAVINGS -- AND I FEEL

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:03.114
VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.148
OKAY AND I APPRECIATE THAT I

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:05.182
GUESS I'M JUST WARNING HOP I

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:06.584
MEAN THE QUESTION WE'RE GOING TO

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:08.519
BE PRESENTING TO VOTERS IS WE

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:09.787
ARE NOT THE QUESTION WHAT THE

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:11.255
REQUEST IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE.

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.757
NOT ONLY THE MONEY THAT YOU

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:16.060
CURRENTLY GIVE THE STATE FOR

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:16.694
THAT -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:18.462
BUT NOW WE WANT MORE MONEY FOR

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:21.632
THE LA IS OFFICE TO DO THE EXACT

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:22.233
SAME JOB.

00:38:22.299 --> 00:38:23.167
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY CORRECT

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:25.603
HOWEVER THE REASON WHY THE LA

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.804
WAS INSTITUTED IS BECAUSE A

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:30.841
PRIOR TO THE THE PRIOR TO THE

00:38:30.908 --> 00:38:32.176
INITIATION OF THE PART IN A

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:32.977
FINANCE.

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:33.944
WE REALLY HAD NO PROFESSIONAL

00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:34.779
FINANCE STAFF AT ALL IN

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:36.180
CALIFORNIA AND WHEN THE

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:36.981
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:38.582
STARTED THAT WAS -- IT

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:41.118
MINISTRATION PERSONNEL THAT WAS

00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:42.453
BASICALLY HIRED TO PUT TOGETHER

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.988
THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET AND

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:45.723
THE LEGISLATURE QUICKLY REALIZE

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:46.223
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.191
PROFESSIONAL.

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:49.126
OPINIONS OF OUR OWN TO BE ABLE

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:49.994
TO COUNTERACT WITH THE

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:51.262
ADMINISTRATION WAS PROPOSING TO

00:38:51.328 --> 00:38:52.863
DO SO BASICALLY WE COULD BELIEVE

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.031
THE DEAL AFTER.

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:55.266
WITH ALL RESPECT YOU KNOW OR NOT

00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:56.567
BELIEVE THEM BUT WE REALLY

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:58.102
DIDN'T HAVE ANY FACTS WHAT WERE

00:38:58.169 --> 00:38:59.770
EXPERT PERSONNEL TO BACK US UP

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:00.738
AND THAT'S WHY THERE IS AN ALLEY

00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:02.073
OKAY BECAUSE THAT THAT TENSION

00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:03.874
IS ALWAYS GOING TO EXIST BETWEEN

00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:04.742
THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:05.876
ADMINISTRATION.

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:06.444
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:07.144
TENSION IS A GOOD THING.

00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:08.813
AND YOU'VE YOU DN'T FEEL HAT

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:10.881
THE POLICY ANALYST -- EMPLOYED

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:13.551
BY THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IN OF

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:14.418
THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS ARE ENOUGH

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:15.820
TO SATISFY.

00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:17.154
THE INCREASE THAT ARE MADE BY

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:18.723
MEMBERS WITH RESPECT TO HAVE

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:19.323
SPENDING.

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.026
NO I DO NOT AND I THINK WE'RE

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:22.760
ALL AWARE SWITCHED FROM

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:24.128
SPECIALLY OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:25.129
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:26.731
CUT A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER POLICY

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:28.632
CAUCUS STAFF IN RECENT YEARS.

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.234
BECAUSE OF BUDGETARY PRESSURES

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:31.402
YOU KNOW WITHIN OUR OWN CAUCUS

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:33.037
AND AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:33.871
HEALTHY THING I THINK WE NEED TO

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:35.873
HAVE PEOPLE WHOSE WHOSE JOB IN

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.074
FULL TIME OCCUPATION IS

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:38.876
ANALYZING THE FISCAL IMPACTS OF

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:43.447

EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE IS

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:16.820
AWARE OF NOT ONLY THE PROMISE OF

00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:17.421
THE FISCAL SYSTEM THAT WE'RE

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:18.055
CURRENTLY DEVELOPING BUT ALSO.

00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:19.189
THE PROBLEMS AND DELAYS THAT

00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:21.558
HAVE RECENTLY PLAGUED THAT PRO

00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:22.926
THE AUDITOR CAME BACK WITH A

00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:23.527
QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:24.962

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:26.697
VERY ALARMING STATISTICS ON HIS

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:27.097
CAL.

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:28.699
AND PARTICULARLY THE AUDITOR WAS

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:30.834
CONCERNED AT THAT THE SLOW

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:32.836
PROGRESS IN DEPLOYING PHYS CAL

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:35.239
WAS GOING TO BECAUSE THE

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:37.041
DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS TO

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:39.276
NOT BE ABLE TO RELIABLY REPORT.

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:40.277
THEIR REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:41.845
FIGURES AND THAT THAT MIGHT

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:43.147
NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE STATE'S

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:44.248
CREDIT RATING.

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:46.750
UNFORTUNATELY THE THAT TURNED

00:44:46.817 --> 00:44:48.585
OUT TO BE OPPRESSION OBSERVATION

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:50.521
BECAUSE JUST LAST MONTH STATE

BEEN FAIRLY BUSY ALTHOUGH WE

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:08.679
HAVE A VERY SMALL TEAM A LITTLE

00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:11.748

WELL AS AS ONE PAGE SUMMARY OF

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:40.310
OUR FINDINGS ON THOSE REPORTS --

00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:42.012
SINCE WE'VE HAD SINCE WE WERE

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:44.147
CREATED WE HAVE COMPLETED THREE

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:45.215
REVIEWS AND THESE ARE FAIRLY

00:49:45.282 --> 00:49:47.217
LABOR INTENSIVE AND WE HAVE

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:49.152
CURRENTLY FIVE REVIEWS UNDER

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:51.688
PRODUCT -- IN PROGRESS.

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:52.856
AND THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:54.725
TAKEN HERE IS KIND OF UNIQUE AND

00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:56.727
IT REALLY APPLIES AN ALTERNATIVE

00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:58.595
BUDGETING METHODOLOGY TO THE

00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:00.464
INCREMENTAL BUDGET PROCESS THAT

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.165
WE CURRENTLY TAKE -- TO BUILD

00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:04.634
THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR BUDGET --

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:05.969
BY REALLY WORKING

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:07.804
COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:10.807
DEPARTMENT PARTNERS -- IN TRYING

00:50:10.874 --> 00:50:12.809
TO IDENTIFY THE REQUIREMENTS

00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:14.544
THAT DRIVE THE MISSION OF THAT

00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:16.613
ORGANIZATION BOTH A VERY CLEARLY

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.281
DEFINED STATUTORY MISSION AS

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:20.517
WELL AS THE EXPECTATIONS OF

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:22.219
LET'S SAY SERVICE LEVELS THAT

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:23.453
WOULD BE PROVIDED BY THOSE

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.456
DEPARTMENTS AND TO CALIFORNIANS --

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:27.858
AS WELL AS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:29.526
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT MIGHT BE

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:30.494
AFFECTED.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.029
AND WE PRIORITIZE AS BEST WE CAN

00:50:33.096 --> 00:50:34.398
THE LIMITED RESOURCES OF THE

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:36.800
STATE AND REALLY TRY TO MAKE

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:37.734
SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING A BIG

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.870
RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS AND

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:41.505
THAT THEIR TARGETED AND

00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:42.339
STRATEGIC.

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:44.241
AND WE HAVE HAD A VARIETY OF

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:46.009
FINDING SINCE SINCE WE CREATED

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:52.282
THE UNIT -- IT CAN BE AN

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:54.151
REDUCTION AND RESOURCES THAT CAN

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:54.818
THE ADDITION OF RESOURCES -- AND

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:55.452
I THINK COMING OUT OF RECESSION

00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:56.653
AND WE HAVE SEEN NOT TO BE MOST

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.888
OFTEN THE CASE -- WHICH WHICH

00:50:57.954 --> 00:50:58.955
PRESUMES THAT THERE'S HIGHER

00:50:59.022 --> 00:51:00.791
SERVICE LEVEL NEEDS IN THOSE

00:51:00.857 --> 00:51:02.859
PARTICULAR ADAM PROPOSALS ARE

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:03.460
PACKAGES THAT MIGHT HAVE COME

00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:04.361
BEFORE YOU.

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:06.563
WE ALSO THINK ABOUT IS THERE

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.231
UNDERLYING MISSION CHANGED OR

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:09.666
HAS IT BEEN MODIFIED SO WE WILL

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:11.435
COME FORWARD WITH PROPOSALS THAT

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:13.103
CHANGE THAT MISSION THROUGH

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.338
BUDGET TRAILER BILL TYPICALLY --

00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:16.339
BUT COULD ALSO TAKE A POLICY

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:17.974
PASSED DEPENDING ON HOW IT

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:20.310
AFFECTS THE RESOURCES OF THAT

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:21.178
DEPARTMENT.

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:22.279
AND WE TRY TO LOOK AT

00:51:22.345 --> 00:51:24.247
OPPORTUNITIES ARE PLACES WHERE

00:51:24.314 --> 00:51:25.415
WE CAN STREAMLINE FUNCTION

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:26.917
FUNCTIONS ARE CONSOLIDATE

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:28.685
FUNCTIONS AND THEN WE REALLY

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:30.454
LOOK AT REGIONAL APPROACHES TO

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.255
SERVICE DELIVERIES -- I THINK

00:51:32.322 --> 00:51:33.924
PROBABLY THE BEST HIGHLIGHTED

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:35.292
ONE IS WITHIN OUR STATE HOSPITAL

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:37.394
PROGRAM WHICH HAS FIVE DISTINCT

00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:39.029
HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE A WIDER.

00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:40.430
RANGE OF SERVICES WE HAVE BEEN

00:51:40.497 --> 00:51:42.532
LOOKING OUT WAYS TO STANDARDIZE

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:43.967
AND STREAMLINE THE SERVICES THAT

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:45.335
ARE PROVIDED SO THAT EACH

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:46.670
HOSPITAL DOESN'T TAKE THEIR OWN

00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:49.105
APPROACH TO THE CARE OF THOSE

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:52.108
BETTER AND COMMITTED THERE.

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:55.111
AND WE WE DO VIEW THIS AS A VERY

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:56.379
IMPORTANT COOPERATIVE WORK

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:58.248
EFFORT THAT WE UNDERTAKE WITH

00:51:58.315 --> 00:52:00.484
OUR DEPARTMENTS WITH OUR AGENCY

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:03.386
PARTNERS AND TRY -- TO

00:52:03.453 --> 00:52:04.921
UNDERSTAND WHERE WHERE THE

00:52:04.988 --> 00:52:06.323
PRIORITIES LIE AND WHERE OUR

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:08.091
PAIN POINTS ARE AND IN TERMS OF

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:10.727
LONG STANDING PROBLEMS OR ISSUES.

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:12.562
I'M ONE THING THAT WE'VE NOTICED

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:14.498
AS THIS PROCESS IT DONE RIGHT IS

00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:16.199
VERY LABOR INTENSIVE AND I THINK

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:17.868
AS WE'VE TALKED BEFORE WE DON'T

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:20.604
WANT TO SACRIFICE QUALITY FOR

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.239
SPEED AND SO WE'VE TAKEN NOT

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:24.107
VERY MUCH TO HEART -- BUT WE'VE

00:52:24.174 --> 00:52:25.909
ALSO LOOKED FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:26.910
TRY.

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:29.513
TO BRING THE CULTURE THE IDEA OF

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:31.181
MISSION BASED REVIEWS INTO OUR

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:32.582
BROADER BUDGET DEVELOPMENT

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:34.351
PROCESS AND SO STARTING LAST

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:36.086
YEAR WE FORMALISE THE PROCESS

00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:37.654
THAT WE KIND OF CALL EARLY

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:38.922
ENGAGEMENT.

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:41.024
IN WHICH WE WORK TO IDENTIFY A

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:43.527
FEW HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES IN

00:52:43.593 --> 00:52:47.397
SPECIFIC POLICY OR PROGRAM AREAS --

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:48.732
IN ADVANCE OF OUR TYPICAL

00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:50.967
TYPICAL BUDGET KICK OFF PROCESS

00:52:51.034 --> 00:52:53.136
AND THEN WE DO SOME VERY FOCUSED

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:54.471
TARGETED MEETINGS WITH THOSE

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:56.506
DEPARTMENTS -- AND AGENCIES TO

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:57.941
TRY TO ADDRESS SOME LONG

00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.943
STANDING PROBLEMS AND TWO

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.111
EXAMPLES OF FAT THAT WERE

00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:02.679
INCLUDED IN OUR JANUARY TEN

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:04.681
BUDGET -- BOTH THIS YEAR AND

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:07.017
ALSO HAD A A PROPOSAL LAST YEAR --

00:53:07.083 --> 00:53:08.318
FOCUSED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:10.253
HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THEN

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.156
ANOTHER PROPOSAL FOCUSED ON AND

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:15.425
THE AT ALPHABET AT ALCOHOLIC

00:53:15.492 --> 00:53:16.660
BEVERAGE CONTROL.

00:53:16.726 --> 00:53:18.528
PROGRAM AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:21.398
A TOPIC UP LATER IN THE AGENDA.

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:22.866
RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:24.568
HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO I WILL

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:26.603
PROBABLY WAIT TO TALK ABOUT THAT

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.104
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL INTO THAT

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:30.674
AND TOPIC IS UP IN THE AGENDA.

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:32.709
I'M JUST FOR CONTEXT OR AN IDEA

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:34.578
FOR ABC THOUGH THE ALCOHOLIC

00:53:34.644 --> 00:53:35.912
BEVERAGE CONTROL DEPARTMENT.

00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:38.715
WE HAD ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED IT

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:40.183
AS A MISSION BASED REVIEW WE HAD

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:43.119
COME TO THIS COMMITTEE -- TO TO

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:44.754
UNDERTAKE THAT WE INTENDED TO

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.289
START IT AND KICKED IT OFF IN

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:48.325
DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:49.793
AFTER SEVERAL MEETINGS IT BECAME

00:53:49.859 --> 00:53:50.760
CLEAR THAT THEY HAD A MUCH MORE

00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:53.964
IMMEDIATE NEED RELATIVE -- TO

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.732
THEIR FUNDING STRUCTURE AND KIND

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:56.933
OF A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.134
BETWEEN THE REVENUES AND

00:53:58.201 --> 00:54:03.940
EXPENDITURES AND THAT'S WHERE WE

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:06.376
IDENTIFIED IT AND IN A PIVOTED.

00:54:06.443 --> 00:54:07.010
TO AN EARLY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:07.644
AND ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE

00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:08.311
EFFORTS THAT WE DO IS THAT WE DO

00:54:08.378 --> 00:54:09.613
VIEW IT AS NIMBLE AND TRYING TO

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:11.114
BE RELEVANT WHEN TOPICS OR

00:54:11.181 --> 00:54:12.182
ISSUES COME UP.

00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:14.384
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY NEED TO MEET

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:15.218
SOME OF THE BUDGET DEADLINES

00:54:15.285 --> 00:54:18.321
THAT -- EXCESS SO WITH ABC WE

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:20.090
PUT FORWARD A PACKAGE WAS PART

00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:22.392
OF THE APRIL ONE SPRING RELEASE

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:23.727
AND WE HAD HOPED TO COMPLETE IT

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:25.061
SOONER BUT IT TOOK A LITTLE

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:27.297
LONGER AGAIN -- FOCUSING ON

00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:29.799
QUALITY NOT DOING IT AND TOO

00:54:29.866 --> 00:54:30.734
FAST.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.436
AND THAT PROPOSAL THAT'S BEING

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:34.270
CONSIDERED BEFORE THE

00:54:34.337 --> 00:54:36.239
LEGISLATURE WILL INCREASE THEIR

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:37.307
LICENSING AND ENFORCEMENT

00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:38.341
CAPACITY.

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:39.776
IT KIND OF TRANSFERS AND

00:54:39.843 --> 00:54:40.944
CENTRALIZES THERE'S THAT

00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:43.246
LICENSING FUNCTIONS INTO A

00:54:43.313 --> 00:54:44.814
SINGLE DIVISION WITHIN THE TO

00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:46.149
THE DEPARTMENT SO I VIEW THAT AS

00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:48.018
REALLY STREAMLINING THAT SO THAT

00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:49.886
THEY CAN -- KIND OF BY FOR KATE

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.588
THE WORK THAT THEY DO IN THE

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:52.422
FIELD.

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:54.758
IT REESTABLISHES THEIR ABILITY

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:56.192
TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS AND

00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:58.495
ADDRESS A SUBSTANTIAL BACKLOG OF

00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.897
REGULATORY ISSUES SO LOOKING AT

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.298
THAT ORGANIZATION THERE HAD BEEN

00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:04.134
A LOT OF STATUS QUO FOR MANY

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.169
YEARS AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:08.838
KIND OF RE LOOK AT WHAT DRIVES

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:10.540
THEIR OVERSIGHT AND DIDN'T THEY

00:55:10.607 --> 00:55:11.141
ARE ALSO.

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:12.742
LOOKING AT WAYS TO MODERNIZE

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:16.479
THEIR ONLINE -- PROCESSING OF

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:20.483
LICENSING APPLICATIONS AND BEING

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:22.185
ABLE TO RECEIVE FINDS.

00:55:22.252 --> 00:55:23.186
YEAH AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:24.020
INTERNAL AYE AUTOMATION THEY

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:24.754
HAVE STAYED LARGELY A PAPER

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:27.757
BASED DEPARTMENT -- AND AND THEN

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:29.025
AS I SAID BECAUSE OF THE

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:30.393
OPERATING SHORTFALL THEY HAVE A

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.795
PROPOSAL THAT WOULD INCREASE

00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:34.497
THEIR FEES -- IN MANY AREAS

00:55:34.564 --> 00:55:34.798
[inaudible]

00:55:34.864 --> 00:55:39.602
AND LET'S SEE -- I DO HAVE I CAN

00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:41.037
PROVIDE IF YOU'D LIKE A BRIEF

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:43.473
UPDATE ON EACH OF THE OTHER

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.941
PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:47.343
THAT ARE REALLY DIRECT RESULT OF

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:49.145
MISSION BASED REVIEW.

00:55:49.212 --> 00:55:50.847
IF THAT'S HELPFUL EXISTE ONE WE

00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:53.249
GO TO QUESTIONS MAYBE THAT'LL BE

00:55:53.316 --> 00:55:56.486
COVERED AS WE GO TO QUESTIONS.

00:55:56.553 --> 00:55:56.986
QUICK QUESTIONS FROM THE

00:55:57.053 --> 00:55:58.154
COMMITTEE [inaudible]

00:55:58.221 --> 00:56:00.223
COMMENTS [inaudible]

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.092
MR GALLAGHER [inaudible]

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:04.527
SO -- I GUESS THIS PROPOSAL JUST

00:56:04.594 --> 00:56:06.129
SEEMS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF THE

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:10.700
ORDINARY -- WE'RE DOING THE NO.

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:11.568
I THINK I'VE ALWAYS BEEN

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:13.269
SUPPORTER OF PERFORMANCE BASED

00:56:13.336 --> 00:56:14.404
BUDGETING I THINK A LOT OF US

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:16.406
ARE -- BUT WHERE WE KIND OF

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:17.974
GOING OUT OF THAT PROCESS AND

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:20.043
ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE.

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.312
THE BILL HERE FOR ONE DEPARTMENT

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:24.414

WE'RE WE'RE SORRY WE'RE NOT ON

00:56:28.418 --> 00:56:29.486
THIS RUBIO WAS BUILT IN THE

00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:32.155
SHELTER IS JUST GIVING A UPDATE

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:34.124
COMMISSION BASE BY THE OKAY.

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:35.291
OKAY REDDIT BUT YOU COULD YOU

00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:35.892
COULD ADDRESS MAYBE YOU COULD

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:36.493
SPEAK TO THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:37.427
LIKE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BEEN IT

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:38.595
SEEMS LIKE THAT MISSION THE

00:56:38.661 --> 00:56:39.763
MISSION BASED BUDGETING THIS

00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:43.900
PROCESS IS BEING GOING PRETTY

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:46.169
WELL -- AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:46.703
BILL THAT'S GOING TO SORT

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:47.837
PROPOSED TO TAKE ONE DEPARTMENT

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:49.939
OUT OF THAT -- AND KINDA SINGLE

00:56:50.006 --> 00:56:52.142
THAT OUT -- DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:53.810
THOUGHTS.

00:56:53.877 --> 00:56:54.410
ON WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:56.446
DOING.

00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:58.448
SURE SO MISSION BASED BUDGETING

00:56:58.515 --> 00:56:59.649
IS.

00:56:59.716 --> 00:57:01.518
ALSO VERY LABOR INTENSIVE I MEAN

00:57:01.584 --> 00:57:03.086
I AM PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:05.054
IS ALSO VERY LABOR INTENSIVE IT

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:06.256
IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TRIED IN

00:57:06.322 --> 00:57:08.591
THE PAST -- IT'S BEEN SOME TIME

00:57:08.658 --> 00:57:10.960
SO BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO

00:57:11.027 --> 00:57:12.996
AND NINETY THREE I WAS WITH THE

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:14.230
DEPARTMENT WHEN WE ON WOUND

00:57:14.297 --> 00:57:15.932
ABOUT PROCESS SO WE DIDN'T FOR

00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:17.367
DEPARTMENTS AND THE DEPARTMENT

00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:18.868
OF PARKS DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER

00:57:18.935 --> 00:57:21.204
AFFAIRS GENERAL SERVICES AND ONE

00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:22.872
OF OUR DATA CENTERS.

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:24.707
WHICH IS -- KIND OF A COMBINED

00:57:24.774 --> 00:57:27.343
THING TODAY -- WE CANCELED THAT

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:28.711
PROJECT AFTER THREE YEARS

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:31.214
BECAUSE OVERALL WE VIEWED IT AS

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:33.550
UNSUCCESSFUL IT'S REALLY HARD TO

00:57:33.616 --> 00:57:36.152
KIND OF IDENTIFY METRICS TO MAKE

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:38.721
DECISIONS ABOUT THE FUNDING

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:40.590
LEVEL FOR PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT --

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:42.158
WHEN I THINK ABOUT A PROGRAM

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:43.793
LIKE MEDICAID ALL AND ITS

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.929
ENTITLEMENT NATURE I THINK IT

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:47.730
BECOMES EVEN MORE CHALLENGING --

00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:49.532
BUT AS THEY TALKED ABOUT THIS

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:51.034
EARLY ENGAGEMENT EFFORT WE HAVE

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.336
DONE A COUPLE THINGS OVER THE

00:57:53.403 --> 00:57:54.537
LAST TWO YEARS RELATIVE

00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:56.105
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:58.041
SERVICES BECAUSE WE NOTED THAT

00:57:58.107 --> 00:58:00.109
THERE WAS SOME FISCAL

00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:01.010
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT NEEDED TO BE

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:03.279
SHORED UP WITHIN THAT DEPARTMENT

00:58:03.346 --> 00:58:05.315
AND SO WE HAVE ADDED -- IN OUR

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:07.116
SCHEDULE AND TRY TO BRING THAT

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:08.685
BRING THEM EARLIER I'M IN A

00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:10.220
COUPLE AREAS BOTH IN MENTAL

00:58:10.286 --> 00:58:12.222
HEALTH AND IN THEIR FISCAL

00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:16.793
OVERSIGHT.

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.661
AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ESTIMATE.

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:21.664
I WOULD JUST CAN ALSO AND WHEN

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:23.266
THIS RUBIO PRESENTED THE BILL

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.500
AND STOP -- SIX SHE EXPRESSED A

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:25.735
WILLINGNESS TO REALLY WORK WITH

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:26.903
THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS WITH

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:30.607
DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE OUT HOW --

00:58:30.673 --> 00:58:31.841
TO GET BOTH GOALS ACCOMPLISHED

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:33.610
SO I KNOW THAT SHE CHOSE.

00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:35.912
THE PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:37.313
LABEL BUT I THINK SHE EXPRESSED

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.849
A DEFINITE INTEREST IN REALLY

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:42.018
WORKING TOGETHER SO I KNOW THAT --

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:43.019
YOU KNOW WE'RE SUPPORT FOR THE

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:44.954
BILL TO MOVE IT FORWARD -- THE

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:46.623
INTENTION I BELIEVE FOR THE

00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:48.458
AUTHOR WAS THAT SHE WAS GOING TO

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:50.159
WORK WITH BERMAN OF FINANCE AND

00:58:50.226 --> 00:58:52.528
THE COMMITTEE. TO TO KIND OF

00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:54.330
WORK TOGETHER -- ANY PARTICULAR

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:57.400
AT THAT PARTICULAR -- DEPARTMENT.

00:58:57.467 --> 00:58:58.768
CAME OUT ON THE FUN THAT THAT

00:58:58.835 --> 00:58:59.235
BILL CAME OUT OF SOME

00:58:59.302 --> 00:59:02.071
FRUSTRATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:59:02.138 --> 00:59:03.840
IN SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONCE IF

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:05.375
YOU IF YOU WERE ON SUB.

00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:06.376
ONE YOU'RE YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR

00:59:06.442 --> 00:59:07.010
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOME OF

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:08.611
THE ISSUES THEY ARE SO I THINK

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:15.385
THAT'S WHY THERE WAS -- MISTER

00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:17.320
MATHIS IS SHAKING SENT.

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:17.854
IN AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.

00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:19.689
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:22.358
WHY WE WERE -- ENCOURAGING MISS

00:59:22.425 --> 00:59:23.226
RUBIO TO MOVE THE BILL FOR BUT

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:24.494
THE SAME TIME TO WORK WITH THE

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.528
COMMITTEE TO WORK BUT APARTMENT

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:26.529
A FINANCE SO THAT WE COULD.

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:28.898
HAVE IT HAS ONE ON ONE PROGRAM

00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:32.101
RATHER THAN TWO I THINK YOU

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:33.269
BRING UP AN EXCELLENT POINT

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:33.569
[inaudible]

00:59:33.636 --> 00:59:36.739
MISTER FUNK.

00:59:36.806 --> 00:59:37.640
FROM FROM A FROM A DAY TO DAY

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:38.241
OPERATIONAL LEVEL CAN YOU CAN

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:38.975
YOU SHED SOME LIGHT AND

00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:40.310
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MISSION BASE

00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:41.477
REVIEW AND PERFORM PERFORMANCE

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:42.545
SPACE REVIEW.

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:44.280
I MEAN YOU SAID IS VERY.

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:47.684
INTENSIVE LABOR WISE SOUTHWEST.

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.019
SO FIRST FIRST I WILL SAY THAT --

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:50.586
CALIFORNIA'S CONSTANTLY AN

00:59:50.653 --> 00:59:52.121
INNOVATOR AND LEADER WE REALLY

00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:54.057
LOOK KIND OF COINED THIS PHRASE

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:55.191
MISSION BASE REVIEW BECAUSE WE

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:56.693
FELT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:59.128
FOCUS ON UNDERLYING STATUTE.

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:01.664
OF A PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION AND

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:03.066
REALLY EXAMINE OUR FOR IT ARE

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:04.600
THEY DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD BE

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:05.835
DOING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:07.036
CALIFORNIA CITIZENS.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:10.073
AND AND REALLY TRYING TO GET --

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:11.774
KIND OF INSIGHT INTO THAT

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:13.643
PROCESS THROUGH A CLOSE AND

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.812
CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:17.847
UNDERLYING STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.816
THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FEDERAL

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.751
REQUIREMENTS AND THEN WHAT KIND

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:23.886
OF SERVICE LEVEL DO WE WANT TO

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:27.056
HAVE -- RELATIVE TO STAFFING AND

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.224
RESOURCING OUR DEPARTMENTS

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:31.027
PARTICULARLY WHEN RESOURCES GET --

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:32.996
MORE LIMITED AND TIGHT

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:34.764
PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING IS

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:36.432
REALLY SOMETHING THAT KIND OF

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:39.202
SETS A PARTICULAR GOAL OR TARGET

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:41.004
FOREIGN ORGANIZATION AND THEN

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.438
DEPENDING ON HOW THEY'RE DOING

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:43.573
AND MEETING THAT BENCHMARK OR

01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:44.707
THAT TARGET.

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.342
THEY WOULD COME IN AND THEN

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:48.344
INCREASE RESOURCES OR

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:50.013
POTENTIALLY DECREASE SO IF THE

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.514
DEPARTMENT WASN'T PERFORMING

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:55.852
WELL AND IT WAS -- THAT THERE

01:00:55.918 --> 01:01:00.857
WAS SOME THOUGHT -- TO NO BETTER

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:01.524
SHORING UP HOW THEY PERFORM YOU

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:02.125
MIGHT GIVE THEM MORE RESOURCES

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:03.426
BUT YOU MIGHT ALSO USE IT AS AN

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.361
OPPORTUNITY TO PENALIZE THEM FOR

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:06.829
NOT PERFORMING IN A PARTICULAR

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:09.465
FASHION -- SO THERE THERE'S A

01:01:09.532 --> 01:01:11.768
REAL DISTINCTION IT'S DIFFICULT

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:15.471
TO DO I THINK MOST STATES -- DO.

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:17.640
IN USE PERFORMANCE METRICS TO

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:18.941
INFLUENCE OR INFORM BUDGET

01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:20.209
CONVERSATIONS I THINK THAT'S

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:21.911
REALLY WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES WHEN

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.246
WE THINK ABOUT THAT FROM AN

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.547
APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY.

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:26.716
BUT WE DON'T LET THOSE METRICS

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:30.620
DRIVE BUDGET DECISIONS -- AND ON

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:32.955
A MORE OF AN AUTO PILOT TYPE

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.657
MODE.

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.125
ENGINE JUST AS A FOLLOW UP.

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:36.592
IS.

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:37.727
IS A PERFORMANCE METRIC

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:40.396
CONSIDERED AS PART OF A MISSION

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:42.498
BASED REVIEW -- I I GUESS I'M

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:43.866
I'M SEEING A DISTINCTION.

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.868
WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE BUT IN

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.770
TERMS OF FROM A FROM A BUDGETARY

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:48.671
SAMPLING.

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:50.840
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO INCORPORATE

01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:54.077
WHETHER THEY'RE ACHIEVING WHAT.

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.111
THE GOAL OF LOCAL THE

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:57.080
LEGISLATURE IS OR WHAT THE GOAL

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:58.448
OF THE OF ANY PIECE OF

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.316
LEGISLATION IS IN TERMS OF

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.084
WHETHER THEY ARE.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.419
DESERVING OR NOT DESERVING OF A

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:04.287
BUNCH OF RESOURCES.

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:06.322
I'M CERTAINLY THAT'S A COMPONENT

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.024
SO TYPICALLY THE WAY THAT THAT

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:09.025
SHOWS UP IN OUR BUDGET

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:10.793
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AS WE MAY

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.628
WANT TO INCREASE SAY A LEVEL OF

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:15.131
SERVICE OR ELIMINATE A BACKLOG.

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:16.666
IN SOME WORK SO WE PROVIDE

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:18.067
RESOURCES WE MAY SET UP

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:19.569
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WHETHER

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:21.337
THAT BE TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.573
BUDGET COMMITTEE TO FINANCE OR

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:25.308
ANOTHER TYPE OF OVERSIGHT INTO

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:25.908
T..

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:27.276
AND WE WOULD PROVIDE REGULAR

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:30.513
UPDATES IN NOT SO WE DO DO A LOT

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.415
A WHAT I WOULD CALL A DATA

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:34.917
DRIVEN DECISION -- BUT SOMETIMES

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.652
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT PERFORMANCE

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:39.455
IT MIGHT BE OKAY FOR PROCESSING

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.524
TO TAKE SIXTY DAYS RATHER THAN

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:42.825
THIRTY DAYS AND THEN YOU COULD

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.494
FIND AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL IF YOU

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.728
MADE SOME OF THOSE TRADE OFFS

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:47.463
AND IN THE MISSION BASED REVIEW

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:48.764
PROCESS WE VIEW.

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.399
THAT AS AN AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:52.201
TALK ABOUT THOSE PARTICULAR

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:54.370
TRADE OFFS -- AND TO BE ABLE TO

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:55.938
FIGURE OUT HOW WE MIGHT EITHER

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:57.807
INVEST RESOURCES OR IN IN THE

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:59.308
EXAMPLE THAT ARE PROVIDED FOR A.

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.244
B. C. WE KIND OF PULLED A

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:02.378
PROCESS OUT.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.680
FROM AN EXISTING PROCESS AND TRY

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.682
TO SET IT UP ON ITS OWN SO COULD

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:08.684
BE BETTER MINE MONITORED AND

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:11.487
TRACK -- IN TERMS OF LICENSING

01:03:11.554 --> 01:03:14.390
AND BEING ABLE -- TO ISSUE THOSE

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:19.195
IN A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME.

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:21.831
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:22.598
THANK YOU ANY OTHER.

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:23.499
COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:26.002
COMMITTEE.

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:27.170
THE ONE THING I WOULD JUST

01:03:27.236 --> 01:03:28.604
REALLY APPRECIATE PER FINANCE

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:29.238
FOR FOR LEADING ON THIS ISSUE I

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:29.438
KNOW.

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:30.406
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:31.541
DEPARTMENTS THEY ARE ON THE

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:33.876
SMALLER SIDE COULD PURPOSELY --

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:35.111
WANTING.

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:36.812
TO GET THIS PROCESS GOING WITH

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:38.247
SOME OF THE SMALLER DEPARTMENTS

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:40.583
IN HOPES THAT WE WE WORK UP TO

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:41.450
SOME OF THE LARGE PARTNERS.

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:44.487
BUT THEN AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE.

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:46.822
YOU AND FRANKLY DEPARTMENTS FOR

01:03:46.889 --> 01:03:48.324
STEPPING FORWARD TO NOSE TIME ON

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:51.894
THE DEPARTMENT'S -- SIDE ACROSS

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:54.030
THE TIME ON THE ON THE ON

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:54.664
FINANCE ASIDE TO REALLY

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:58.000
APPRECIATE IT THIS PROCESS SO.

01:03:58.067 --> 01:04:03.673
WITH THAT SINGLE.

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:05.675
MR OBERNOLTE.

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:07.643
I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO --

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:09.412
MISTER CHANG AND I SEVERAL YEARS

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:10.746
AGO JOINT AUTHORED A BILL THAT.

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.248
KIND OF PUT US ON THIS PATH TO

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.583
WHAT WHAT WITHIN CALLED ZERO

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:14.317
BASED BUDGETING WHICH ARE.

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:15.151
NOW CALLING MISSION BASED

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:16.219
BUDGETING SO I'M VERY EXCITED

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:17.286
AND HAPPY TO SEE YOU MOVING

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.055
FORWARD WITH THAT -- I THINK

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.289
THAT.

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.357
WHEN WE DID THAT IT WAS BORN OUT

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:22.925
OF FRUSTRATION FOR THE WAY THAT

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:23.526
THE CURRENT BUDGETING PROCESS

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:24.160
WORKED AND A DESIRE TO SEE IT

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:25.761
WORK BETTER IN A WAY THAT

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:26.295
HOLISTICALLY LOOKED AT?

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:26.963
WHAT EACH DEPARTMENT WAS

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.863
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AND WHETHER

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:29.131
OR NOT THEY HAD SUFFICIENT

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.933
RESOURCES TO DO IT?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.735
SO WE WERE IN HOPES THAT AS

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.303
YOU'RE DOING NOW WE START WITH A

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.870
SMALLER DEPARTMENTS

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:37.039
TRANSITIONING OVER TO THE BIGGER

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:38.774
DEPARTMENTS CAN YOU TALK ABOUT.

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.409
THE THE YOU TALK ABOUT A COUPLE

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:41.344
OF THE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:42.812
YOU TALK ABOUT LIKE THIRTY

01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:43.946
THOUSAND FOOT VIEW.

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:44.814
HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN YOUR

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.682
OPINION -- WHAT YOU THINK THE

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.251
TIME LINE WOULD BE FOR

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:49.719
TRANSITIONING TO LARGER

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:51.187
DEPARTMENTS AND WHETHER OR NOT

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:52.655
YOU THINK THAT MAYBE THIS WOULD

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.924
BE ULTIMATELY THE WAY THAT WE DO

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:57.093
BUDGETING INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT?

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.361
METHODOLOGY.

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:01.831
SURE -- AND SO FIRST WE DID TRY

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:02.765
TO START WITH SMALLER

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:04.200
DEPARTMENTS BUT WE DID ALSO TAKE

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:05.234
ON THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:07.103
HOSPITALS WHICH I WOULD SAY IS

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.938
NOT A SMALL.

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:09.405
BY ANY STRETCH OF THE

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:11.774
IMAGINATION ONE OF THE LESSONS

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:13.042
THAT WE'VE LEARNED PARTICULARLY

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:14.477
IN NOT REVIEW BECAUSE IT WAS SO

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:15.745
BIG AND WE KIND OF HAD

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:17.313
EVERYTHING ABOUT THEIR

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.682
OPERATIONS AND PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.817
WERE LOOKING AT IT'S PROBABLY TO

01:05:21.884 --> 01:05:23.619
PICK -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:25.321
THIS THAT PARTICULAR PROPOSAL

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:28.357
SINCE EARLY -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:31.961
ADMITTEDLY WITH MY TEAM AS IT'S

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.396
I THINK THERE'S JUST UNDER FIVE

01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:34.964
OF US FROM A FULL TIME

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:36.632
EQUIVALENT PERSPECTIVE SO.

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:38.334
JUST -- THE WORK IS TIME

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:40.736
INTENSIVE IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.705
AND RESOURCES ON THE

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.307
DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE OVER

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.442
TIME AND IN THEIR TIME -- AND

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:48.744
STATE HOSPITALS IN PARTICULAR WE

01:05:48.811 --> 01:05:50.746
ARE ABOUT WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:52.848
YOU KNOW MATHEMATICALLY HALFWAY

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:53.783
THROUGH.

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:56.819
AND WE HAVE THREE BIG PROPOSALS

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:58.854
BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:00.156
WHICH ART IS KIND OF THE FIRST

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:02.558
BIG PIECES OF WORK TO COME OUT

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:03.492
OF THAT.

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:06.162
AND WE HAVE SMALLER ONES SO VERY

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:08.531
SMALL DEPARTMENT PER -- PERSONAL

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:11.567
EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD -- IT

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.336
WAS DONE IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:15.137
OF TIME BUT I WOULD SAY THAT

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:17.106
WHAT WE TOOK ON AND I THINK WHAT

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:17.940
YOU'VE CAUTIONED US WHEN WE

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:21.043
FIRST MET WAS VERY AMBITIOUS --

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:24.680
WE ALSO HAVE TO KIND OF FIT OUR

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:26.749
WORK IN ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENT'S

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.818
PORTFOLIO BECAUSE WE TRY NOT TO

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:30.786
JUST DO IT IN ISOLATION SO WE

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.154
WORK WITH OUR BUDGET.

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:33.656
COUNTERPARTS IN THE RESEARCH AND

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:36.225
ANALYSIS UNIT THAT I AM MANAGING

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.494
AND AND WANT TO BRING THEM ALONG

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:40.429
AND BRING THEM UP TO SPEED -- IF

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:41.864
NOT HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE ON

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:43.666
SOME OF THE A VERY INTENSIVE

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.868
SITE VISITS WE DO SO FOR

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:46.502
INSTANCE IN STATE HOSPITALS WE

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:47.370
WENT.

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.438
TO ALL FIVE HOSPITALS -- SOME OF

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:52.608
THEM MORE THAN ONCE WE WENT AND

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.477
VISITED AID -- JAIL BASED

01:06:54.543 --> 01:07:00.349
FACILITY THAT DEALING WITH OUR

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:00.883
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:02.918
POPULAR SHIN SO WE IT'S A VERY

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:05.254
INTENSE FIELD KIND OF FOCUSED --

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.490
REVIEW -- SO MY CONCLUSION IS

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:08.090
THAT I THINK TAKING OFF MORE

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:11.527
BITE SIZE PIECES -- IS PROBABLY

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:13.562
EASIER AND MORE DURABLE AND MORE

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:14.864
ANALOGOUS TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:16.399
TRYING TO PERMEATE A LITTLE BIT

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.234
MORE THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROCESS

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.469
WHICH IS THE EARLY ENGAGEMENT SO.

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:22.438
I VIEWED THE MISSION BASED

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:24.440
REVIEWS KIND OF HELPING TO

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:26.342
INFORM THIS EARLY ENGAGEMENT

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:27.743
EFFORT WHICH WERE TRYING TO DO

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:29.645
MORE AND MORE -- IN THE

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.013
DEPARTMENT BUT IF YOU REALLY

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.582
WANTED TO DO THIS ON EVERYTHING

01:07:33.649 --> 01:07:34.817
THAT WE DO FROM A BUDGET

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:37.052
BUILDING PERSPECTIVE -- FIRST

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:38.487
NOT EVERYTHING LENDS ITSELF TO

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:40.823
THAT SUMMER VERY WORKLOAD WITH

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:41.991
JUDY DRIVEN PROPOSALS SO WE

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:43.826
PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO INVEST

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.294
THAT KIND OF TIME AND ENERGY ON

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:47.496
WHERE IS OTHERS NEED TO FOCUS

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:48.864
LOOKS AND PARTICULAR PROGRAMS OR

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:51.767
AREAS BUT IF YOU WANTED TO DO IT.

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:53.469
ACROSS THE BOARD IT WOULD IT

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:55.438
WOULD -- SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:56.572
THE SIZE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:57.907
FINANCE AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IT

01:07:57.973 --> 01:08:01.410
WOULD RESULT IN THE OUTCOMES

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:02.812
THAT YOU'RE KIND OF WOULD BE

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:03.712
LOOKING FOR TO DO THAT SO I

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.748
THINK CONTINUE TO DO THE

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:07.283
TARGETED FOCUSED REVIEWS.

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:09.785
PRIORITIZED -- BY EACH OF OUR

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:12.087
PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER AREAS --

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:13.923
WHICH LARGELY LINE UP WITH OUR

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:15.458
CABINET AREAS AND THE DEPARTMENT.

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:17.159
IS IS PROBABLY A REASONABLE

01:08:17.226 --> 01:08:19.128
APPROACH IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:21.530
TIME TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH.

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:23.632
THOSE ISSUES AND AND THEN THERE

01:08:23.699 --> 01:08:24.900
ARE ALSO OTHER PURCHASE THAT

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:27.203
WORK -- SO FOR INSTANCE THE WORK

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:29.572
OF OF SAY OUR OFFICE OF STATE

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:31.006
AUDITS AND EVALUATION ON

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:33.542
PARTICULAR AREAS -- OF THE STATE

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.444
IS IS ALSO ANOTHER APPROACH OR

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:37.213
TOOL THAT WE KIND OF HAVE IN OUR

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.315
FINANCE TOOL BELT TO ADDRESS

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:41.383
SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS.

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:42.585
SURE THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THAT'S

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:43.252
WHERE ABOUT WHERE WE THOUGHT WE

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.687
WERE GOING TO LAND RIGHT WAS

01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:45.521
THAT THIS WASN'T GOING TO BE THE

01:08:45.588 --> 01:08:47.056
ANSWER -- FOR DOING EVERY

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:48.858
DEPARTMENT EVERY YEAR BUT

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:50.426
PERHAPS THIS WAS GOING TO INFORM

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:52.661
OUR OTHER BUDGETING PRACTICES SO

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:54.029
ONE OF THE HOPES WHEN WE STARTED

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:59.568
WAS THAT THE TRULY LARGE

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:00.169
DEPARTMENTS LIKE -- DEPARTED

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:02.104
TRANSFER ASIAN FOR EXAMPLE WE

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:02.705
KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE

01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:03.339
ABLE -- TO MISSION BASED BUDGET

01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:04.573
THOSE DEPARTMENTS IN ANY GIVEN

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.407
YEAR BUT WE'RE GONNA TAKE A

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.275
LITTLE BITE SIZED PIECES AND

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:08.444
DOING ON A ROLLING BASIS -- IS

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:09.245
THAT STILL THE PLAN AND YOU HAVE

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:11.013
A A PLAN TO TACKLE THOSE LARGER

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.282
PROJECTS SO SO CERTAINLY THAT IS

01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:15.050
THE CONCEPT OF THE IDEA FOR A

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:17.019
LARGER DEPARTMENTS -- I DON'T

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:17.920
KNOW THAT IF IT'S GOING TO BE

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.189
SOLELY MISSION BASED REVIEWS BUT

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:21.991
A COMBINATION OF OUR MISSION

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:23.025
BASED REVIEWS ON THIS EARLY

01:09:23.092 --> 01:09:24.560
ENGAGEMENT PROCESS.

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.262
THAT WE STARTED LAST YEAR I

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.197
THINK HELP US BREAK THOSE BIGGER

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:29.965
DEPARTMENTS INTO BITE SIZE

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:32.401
CHUNKS -- TRANSPORTATION WE HAVE

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:34.236
BEEN KIND OF WORKING ON THAT

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:36.138
OVER SOME PERIOD OF TIME --

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:38.007
THOUGH I THINK IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:40.543
SB ONE KIND OF SHIFTED THE FOCUS

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:42.211
AND NOT ORGANIZATION AND THEY

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:44.246
CONTINUE TO DO THEIR CAP OUT LEE

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:46.181
SUPPORT PROGRAM THROUGH A ZERO

01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:47.583
BASED PROCESS BASED ON THE

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:49.184
REVENUE THAT'S AVAILABLE IN ANY

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:50.452
GIVEN YEAR.

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:52.221
SO I I THINK THAT'S TRUE THAT WE

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.223
WILL YOU KNOW TRY TO BE LOOKING

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:55.357
AT THAT AND WE'LL TAKE.

01:09:55.424 --> 01:09:57.059
PIECES OF BIG DEPARTMENTS OVER

01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:58.894
TIME AND ADDRESS THEM EITHER

01:09:58.961 --> 01:09:59.895
THROUGH THE MISSION BASED REVIEW

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:01.730
EARLY ENGAGEMENT WITH HAD A

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:03.132
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN OUR

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:05.467
ADMINISTRATION OBVIOUSLY -- WITH

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:06.869
THE ELECTION AS WELL AS A CHANGE

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:09.271
IN OUR ORGANIZATION AND SO OUR

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:11.640
PLAN IS TO REGROUP IN THE SUMMER.

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:13.442
AND TALK AS A DEPARTMENT WITH

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:15.110
OUR LEADERSHIP AND EXECUTIVES IN

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:16.278
THE DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE OUT

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:17.846
WHAT OUR NEXT SET OF PRIORITIES

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:19.815
ARE AND OUR CURRENT FOCUS IS

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:21.283
REALLY FINISHING WHAT WE STARTED

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:23.085
WE HAVE FIVE REVIEWS STILL UNDER

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:23.986
WAY.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.688
WE'VE BEEN KIND OF BRINGING

01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:28.591
RESULTS AS WE CAN ON THOSE

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:29.792
PROPOSALS I THINK THEY'RE

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.860
SEVERAL PROPOSALS BEFORE THE

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:32.861
LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR.

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:34.964
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:36.198
TO WE WRAP THIS UP SO TAKING ON

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:37.933
NEW STUFF RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.768
PROBABLY NOT IN OUR BEST

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:44.540
INTEREST.

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:45.140

JUST ABOVE ONE HUNDRED BILLION

DOLLARS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:42.197

IN RECENT YEARS THE SIZE AND

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:52.074
COMPLEXITY OF DCS HAS RESULTED

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.809
IN SIZEABLE BUDGET ERRORS DUE TO

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:55.444
POOR INTERNAL PROCEDURES. FOR

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.780
EXAMPLE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE

01:11:57.846 --> 01:11:58.947
MEDI CAL ESTIMATE WAS FOUND TO

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.582

BILLION THAT'S BILLION WITH A B..

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:04.853
DUE TO MISCALCULATION OF COST IN

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:14.496
THESE TOURS WERE SO LARGE THAT

OF THE SMALLER OPERATIONS.

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:26.542
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS OCCURRED

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:28.310
THE DEPARTMENT'S HANDLING OF HIS

ON TOP OF THAT THE PURPOSE

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.673
ASKING FOR ANOTHER FOUR POINT

THAT NO SUCH REGULATIONS EXIST

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:18.727
THAT DCS WAS NOT BOUND BY ANY

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:20.596

THIS IS EITHER A BLATANT LIE ARE

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:27.436
YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.037
INCOMPETENCE.

THEY NEED TO BE A HIGHER

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:39.081
STANDARD.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.749
FROM THE TOP ON DOWN IS THROUGH

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:42.484
THE DH CS NEED THE CULTURE

AB SEVENTY FOURTEEN WILL BEGIN A

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:50.926
DIFFICULT CONVERSATION ON HOW TO

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:53.128
BEST IMPROVE JCS INCREASE

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:55.531

PRESENT HERE TODAY LOOK FOR

01:13:58.133 --> 01:14:07.509
PUTTING THE BILL THIS RUBIO DOES.

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:08.010
AND FOR THE FULL BUDGET

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:09.211
COMMITTEE [inaudible]

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.013
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:12.881
OUR FINAL.

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.283
HI RANDALL OR DEPARTMENT OF

01:14:14.349 --> 01:14:16.485
FINANCE -- WE AGREE WITH THE

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:18.053
AUTHOR ON THE NEED -- TO IMPROVE

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.354
ESTIMATING -- ON MEDI CAL AT THE

01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:21.356
DEPARTMENT -- BUT I THINK WE

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:21.857
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:22.858
DIFFERENCE OF OF APPROACH AND

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:23.692
AND SO CURRENTLY WE ARE RIGHT IN

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:24.827
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- WE

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.728
HAVE TO PROPOSALS THAT ARE

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:28.063
CURRENTLY BEFORE THE HEALTH

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.798
HUMAN SERVICES SUBCOMMITTEE THIS

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:31.366
YEAR TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:34.670
PROBLEMS -- THE FIRST -- BEING --

01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:36.638
SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:38.674
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO DH CS TO

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.610
IMPROVE -- FISCAL ESTIMATING AND

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:42.477
STRENGTH AND CASH FLOW

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:45.013
MONITORING -- AND I'M I'M GLAD

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.348
THAT THE ARCHIVE THE AUTHOR'S

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:49.318
ARGUMENTS -- DRESSED -- THE THE

01:14:49.384 --> 01:14:50.419
SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY RELATING

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:52.287
TO DRUG REBATES -- BECAUSE WE

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:53.889
HAVE A SECOND PROPOSAL THAT

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:56.158
WOULD CREATE A SPECIAL FUND --

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:57.326
THAT WOULD HELP US MANAGE THAT

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:59.494
VOLATILITY -- RESULTING FROM

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:01.029
DRUG REBATES AND HOPEFULLY BRING --

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:03.632
SOME GREATER DEGREE OF CERTAINTY

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:04.700
TO GENERAL FUND SPENDING ON MEDI

01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:06.735
CAL OVER TIME -- I'M HAPPY

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:10.339
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE

01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:13.108
PROPOSALS.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.142
DID YOU EVER COMMENT ON THE

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:15.410
PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:17.045
ASPECT OF IT.

01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:18.046
I I THINK THAT THE CORE PART OF

01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:20.182
THAT ARGUMENT IS JUST THAT THE

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:21.783
THE PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:24.386
OF MY COLLEAGUE -- MENTIONED THE

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:26.421
THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND RESOURCES

01:15:26.488 --> 01:15:27.990
LABOR THAT GOES INTO THAT SORT

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:29.224
OF PROCESS.

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:30.759
AND OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:33.195
THAT THE BILL WOULD DISTRACT

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:34.763
FROM THESE OTHER EFFORTS THAT

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:37.099
WERE WERE BUT I PROPOSING THIS

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:38.233
YEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE SAYS

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:38.800
IF I GET A RIGHT WE'RE GONNA

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:39.935
GIVE THEM MORE MONEY.

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:42.004
AND THE ISSUE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:43.171
AS I WAS WITH HER PRESENT IT IS

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:44.439
JUST OVER CAL OVERSIGHT

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.074
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:46.675
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VERY TO

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:52.014
MEDICARE'S AND WE'RE TALKING --

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.182
WAS AT ONE POINT. EIGHT BILLION

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.550
ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:58.053
AND TWENTY BILLION ONE PLATE

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.755
GLASS SNIFFING AMOUNT SO.

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.423
THAT'S PLAY THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.824
THING AND IT'S IT'S LEGISLATURE

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:04.192
THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT

01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:05.260
TO WITH OVERSIGHT SORE GIVE YOU

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.228
MORE MONEY BUT WHERE IS THE

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:08.263
OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:08.764
I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S MY

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:11.166
QUESTION.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.034
I THINK THAT IS SO I THINK WE

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.235
AGREE THAT THERE IS THIS GROWING

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:14.269
COMPLEXITY IN THE PROGRAM THAT

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:15.771
THE AMOUNTS THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:18.807
ABOUT HAVE GROWN OVER TIME --

01:16:18.874 --> 01:16:20.442
I'M NOT REALLY SURE EXACTLY HOW

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:22.210
PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING IS

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:24.947
AIMED TO ADDRESS THOSE THOSE

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:26.548
TYPES OF PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:28.850
THE THE THE ESTIMATING --

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:33.021
VARIATIONS HAVE REALLY COME FROM --

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:34.489
THE THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:37.192
ON A CASH BASIS -- THE TIMING OF

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:38.593
VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:41.029
TRANSACTIONS CAN CAN HAVE A HUGE

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:43.165
EFFECT ON WHAT SPENDING IS FROM

01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:44.466
YEAR TO YEAR AND I THINK THAT'S

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:45.600
THE KIND OF THING THAT WE'VE

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:48.270
SEEN IN THE PAST -- AND WHILE I

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:49.938
ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE AUTHOR'S

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:51.306
ARGUMENT ABOUT GIVING THEM MORE

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:54.109
RESOURCES KIND OF AN INCENTIVE --

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:57.045
PROBLEM I SUPPOSE -- THE THE

01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:58.814
CHALLENGES HERE REALLY RELATE TO

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.015
THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:02.551
TRANSACTIONS AND AND BEING ABLE

01:17:02.617 --> 01:17:03.785
TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT BETTER

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:04.987
COORDINATE.

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:07.155
BETWEEN UNITS AND AND AND

01:17:07.222 --> 01:17:09.958
ESSENTIALLY TRACK THESE THESE

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.593
TRANSACTIONS BETTER I THINK THAT

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.096
WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THOSE --

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:15.864
THOSE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS ARE

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:19.034
ARE WHAT'S GOING TO IMPROVE THE

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:22.771
ESTIMATE OVER TIME.

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:24.039
QUESTION FROM THE SHELTON SO ON

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:26.341
DO YOU ANTICIPATE -- THIS

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:27.442
DEPARTMENT BEING ON THE LIST ANY

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:28.176
TIME SOON.

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:29.544
I GUESS THAT THE THE BROADER

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:30.746
QUESTION IS IS.

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:33.148
THE ULTIMATE MISSION OF THE

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:35.884
DEPARTMENT IS TO INCREASE HEALTH

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:37.686
CARE ACCESS FOR FOR ALL

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:38.920
CALIFORNIANS.

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.622
AND AT TIMES -- THE COMMITTEE

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:42.424
THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS FELT THAT

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.825
THE DEPARTMENT'S BEEN.

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:46.962
SOMEWHAT COMBATIVE FOR SOMEONE --

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:47.462
THEY HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:48.663
DRACONIAN APPROACH SO THAT IT'S

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:50.866
NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY'RE TRYING

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:52.734
TO INCREASE ACCESS BUT ALMOST.

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:53.935
THERE THERE ARE THINGS THAT

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:56.405
SOMETIMES PENALIZED -- THIS IS A

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:58.206
CALIFORNIA FROM BEING TO ACCESS

01:17:58.273 --> 01:18:00.308
HEALTH CARE SO THAT DOES SEEM TO

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:05.347
BE SORT OF A IN CONFLICT WITH

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:06.615
THEIR MISSION.

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:07.215
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THOSE ARE

01:18:07.282 --> 01:18:07.883
CERTAINLY IMPORTANT THINGS TO BE

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:08.884
CONSIDERING AND EVALUATING IN

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:11.420
THE PROGRAM THAT SAID THE REVIEW

01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:12.788
THAT MY COLLEAGUE SPOKE OF WAS

01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:14.256
SOMETHING THAT I INITIATED WHEN

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:15.824
I WAS MANAGING THAT PARTICULAR

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:18.226
AREA -- BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:20.495
WITH THEIR ESTIMATE PROCESS AND

01:18:20.562 --> 01:18:22.097
THERE ARE EIGHT UNIT THAT HAVE

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:24.166
TOUCH POINTS IN MOUNT PROCESS

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:25.867
MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US

01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:27.602
TO GET A HANDLE ON AND I THINK

01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:29.037
THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:31.606
WE HAVE TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:32.874
AND I THINK SHORING UP SOME OF

01:18:32.941 --> 01:18:35.110
THESE PROCESS SEES HAVING BETTER

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:36.912
REPORTING ACCOUNTABILITY

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.647
PREDICTABILITY MONTHLY

ELEMENTS TO HELPING NOT

01:18:48.156 --> 01:18:50.025
ORGANIZATION AND I THINK THEN

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:51.493
WHEN YOU GET THAT PICTURE.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.195

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:54.529
INFORM SOME OF THOSE PROGRAM

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:56.298

AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:07.876
PRIORITIES OVER THE SUMMER WITH

01:19:07.943 --> 01:19:09.744
THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE WHICH

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:14.549
AND HERE'S TO SUBVENTIONS A BIG

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:15.617
THING WILL BE TO OUR OUR LGBT.

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:18.086
LGBT Q. YOUTH ARE ARE VETERANS

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:19.020
AT BIG ISSUE A SUICIDE

01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:21.690
PREVENTION AND THEY'RE FUNDED

01:19:21.756 --> 01:19:22.657
FROM A POINT THREE MILLION

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:24.359
DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS.

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:24.893
THEY NEVER STAND UP THEIR

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.262
SUICIDE HOTLINE NEVER STOOD UP.

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:28.330
MAY HAVE THE GALL TO ASK FOR

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.298
ADDITIONAL. FOUR POINT THREE

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:32.134
MILLION MORE ON TOP OF THAT IT

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.069
IS SOME POINT.

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:35.504
AND THAT'S THAT'S ACTUAL RELEASE

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:36.438
REAL STUFF THAT'S REAL DEAL

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:37.739
PEOPLE TO KILL THEMSELVES AND

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:39.374
I'M SURE.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.876
IF THIS IS BEEN IN PLACE WE MAY

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:46.781
PREVENTED SOME OF TAKING THEIR

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:48.016
OWN LIFE.

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:48.650
SO IT AT SOME POINT THINGS HAVE

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:50.919
TO CHANGE.

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:51.486
AND THAT THIS IS REAL THIS

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:52.287
PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:53.455
HERE NOT SOME BUDGET NOT SOME

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:55.323
NUMBER PERFORMANCE BASED DANDER

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.025
IT'S THEY'VE IT THEY HAVE FALLEN

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:57.993

AND FOR US TO Q. FIFTEEN TO FUND

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:01.563
THEM IN.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.598
THE STATUS QUO IS UNACCEPTABLE.

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:05.967
PEOPLE EITHER DEALING WITH.

01:20:06.034 --> 01:20:07.235
THANK YOU DOCTOR.

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:09.137
YES -- I I APPRECIATE.

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:09.871
THE PRESENTATION IN THE ISSUE

01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:10.872
THAT YOU'RE BRINGING FORTH WHICH

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:11.540
OBVIOUSLY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:13.074
WHAT I THINK WHAT I'M TRIP

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:14.109
WRESTLING WITH AN AYE MAYBE

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:14.643
THOUGH THE START TO IS THE

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:16.244
CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.512
REQUESTING?

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:19.214
AND THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:22.250
OF THESE ARE -- THIS IS A MAJOR

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:23.852
ISSUE IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP.

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:26.087
OVERSIGHT I'M NOT SURE IF IF WE

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:27.455
DOING THAT THE THE BUDGET PIECE

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:28.857
IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE BUDGET

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:30.792
THAT WILL ACTUALLY GET TO THE

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:31.626
PROBLEM WE HAVE WE OBVIOUSLY

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:32.661
HAVE SOME.

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:33.962
SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN LEADERSHIP

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:36.331
WITH REGARDS TO PEOPLE TAKING A

01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:37.799
CHARGE IN MAKING SURE THE

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:40.001
PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENTED AND ALL

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:40.569
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND I

01:20:40.635 --> 01:20:41.636
COULD SEE OUT.

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:43.038
IF WE DO THE BUDGETING I I'M I'M

01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:44.072
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:46.141
CONNECTION IS BETWEEN THIS

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:47.409
REQUEST AND THAT AND OF AND

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:48.376
PROBABLY CAME OUT OF SHEER

01:20:48.443 --> 01:20:48.944
FRUSTRATION.

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.111
OF SAYING YOU KNOW WE WANT TO

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:52.147
HOLD ON THE MONEY AND AND MAKE

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:53.181
SURE YOU'RE NOT SPENDING MONEY

01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:54.482
THAT THAT THAT SHOULDN'T BE

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:55.850
THERE WHATEVER IT MAY BE.

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.118
BUT IT SEEMS THAT THAT'S ONE

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:57.986
THING THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:20:58.053 --> 01:20:59.221
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:00.655
PERFORMANCE BASED BUDGETING

01:21:00.722 --> 01:21:02.424
PROCESS WHICH IS SOMEWHAT LITTLE

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:02.824
BIT.

01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:04.526
QUITE DIFFERENT THAN BASICALLY

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:05.627
TALKING ABOUT OVERSIGHT

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:12.367
MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP AND

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:13.635
ACCOUNTABILITY I MEAN.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:14.269
THEY HAVE SOME CONNECTION BUT I

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:14.869
COULD SEE IS ENGAGING IN THIS

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:15.403
PROCESS WITH THE OF THE

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.072
BUDGETING PROCESS AND GETTING

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:17.839
THAT PART.

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:19.474
DOWN AND THEN STILL HAVING THIS

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.142
OVER HERE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:22.644
FOLKS WHO ARE WHO ARE BASICALLY

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.212
IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMS THAT

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:25.480
WE'VE ASKED TO AND BEING

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:26.748
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE.

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:27.616
THINGS AND COMING BACK AND

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:29.751
REPORTING TO US WHEN THINGS ARE

01:21:29.818 --> 01:21:31.386
NOT THERE OR NOT SHOULD BE THERE

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:32.153
SO.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.288
IF YOU KNOW YOU COULD YOU

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:35.724
CONNECT THE DOTS OR BECAUSE EVEN

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:37.058
IF YOU JUST SAY IT WELL WITH

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.159
GOD'S WHETHER WE DO THIS THIS

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.928
AND THIS WE NEED TO DO THIS

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:41.696
WHICH IS TRUE BUT SO SOME TRYING

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:42.864
TO FIGURE OUT.

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:44.566
WHETHER NOT IF WE IF WE ENGAGE

01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:45.900
IN THIS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:47.335
HAVE A SYSTEMATIC PROCESS OF

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:48.870
DOING THIS WITH AN AD THAT WOULD

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:50.338
GET US.

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:51.172
TO THE SOLUTION TO THIS

01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:54.476
PARTICULAR PROBLEM QUICKLY.

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:55.410
SURE I WAS AT THE EDGE THAT

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:56.344
QUESTION THE AUTHORS NOT HERE

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:59.881
SHE'S ON A PLANE RIGHT NOW -- SO

TAKE A CRACK AT A SO SO DOCTOR

01:22:03.885 --> 01:22:05.053
BY THINKING YOU YOU BROUGHT UP A

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.354
POINT THAT MR GALLAGHER BROUGHT

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:06.921
UP THAT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:07.689
POINT.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:07.856
SO.

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:08.523
WE DO HAVE A DO PASS

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.959
RECOMMENDATION FOR THE BILL

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:11.559
TODAY TO MOVING ON COMMITTEE.

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:13.328
BUT THE AUTHOR HAS COMMITTED TO

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:14.596
TO WORK WITH US BUT ALSO TO WORK

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:16.665
WITH FINANCE SO WE CAN REALLY

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:18.266
ALIGNED ALONG THIS PROCESS RIGHT

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:24.873
SO I THINK.

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:26.808
THE AUTHOR HAD ORIGINALLY.

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.677
CHOSEN TO USE THE PERFORMANCE

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:30.245
BASED BUDGETING A PROPOSAL BUT

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:31.346
WE ALSO THE COMMITTEE LET HER

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:32.580
KNOW ABOUT THIS MISSION MISSION

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:33.715
BASED BUDGETING PROPOSAL THAT'S

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:34.749
READY IN THE WORKS I KNOW IT'S

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:34.949
NOT.

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:36.551
THAT WELL KNOWN THROUGHOUT

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.687
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE WE

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:39.254
CONSISTENTLY MYSELF MISTRAL

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:39.721
MULTI.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.222
THIS MCCARTY BECAUSE AS WE GET

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:42.524
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS FROM OF

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:43.091
MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUE SO.

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:43.792
I THINK BASED ON THAT

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:45.794
INFORMATION SHE WANTED.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:46.361
TO STEP MEETING WITH PUBLIC

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:48.029
FINANCE TRY TO WORK OUT A PATH

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:50.231
BEFORE WE ARE WE ARE SUPPORT

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.333
ABOUT THE BILL MOVING FORWARD.

01:22:51.399 --> 01:22:52.934
TODAY EVEN IN ITS CURRENT FORM

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:54.769
BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT HELPS

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:56.738
CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION ON A

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:58.373
DEPARTMENT THAT AT TIMES HASN'T

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.642
BEEN THE MOST RESPONSIVE TO THE

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.975
LEGISLATURE.

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:03.311
I'M THINKING WE HOPE THAT BY

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:04.179
WORKING WITH PUBLIC FINANCE WE

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:04.746
CAN.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:07.582
FIND A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN ALL

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:10.385
AGREE ON ALL OF US AND AND

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.320
REALLY MADE A MOVE THIS AGENCY

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:13.521
FOR IT SO CAN REALLY SERVE.

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:15.290
ITS MISSION ABOUT PROVIDING

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:21.996
GREATER HEALTH CARE ACCESS FOR

01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:24.265
ALL OF US MR WORLD.

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:24.866
I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO --

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:25.467
I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:25.934
EFFORT TO INCREASE OUR

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:26.568
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:27.202
APARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES I

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:30.171
pLONGER TEN YEAR FOR THE AVERAGE

01:23:30.238 --> 01:23:31.373
LEGISLATOR.

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:32.640
I'M HOPEFUL THAT.

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:34.376
WE WILL EXERCISE THAT OVERSIGHT

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:35.877
ROLE MORE OFTEN AND I THINK THIS

01:23:35.944 --> 01:23:37.946
IS -- THAT THE THE FAILURES THAT

01:23:38.012 --> 01:23:40.482
YOU'VE RAISED -- IS AN EXCELLENT

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:41.349
CATALYST FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:43.418
THAT -- I DO SHARE THE CHAIRS

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:45.520
CONCERNS ABOUT THE MECHANISM BY

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:46.921
WHICH THIS BILL GOES ABOUT THAT

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:48.556
OVERSIGHT YOU HEARD THE

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:49.591
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TESTIFIED

01:23:49.657 --> 01:23:49.991
THAT.

01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:51.359
WE TRY PERFORMANCE BASED

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:52.827
BUDGETING WE CONSIDER THAT A

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:54.295
FAILURE WHEN WE TRY TO THREE

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:56.197
YEARS AGO -- I'M NOT SURE WHY IT

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:57.365
WOULD MAKE SENSE TO BRING THAT

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:58.967
BACK ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE GOT

01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:00.368
TO OTHER FORMS OF BUDGETING THAT

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:02.103
WERE ALREADY WORKING ON IN THE

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:03.538
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO.

01:24:03.605 --> 01:24:04.739
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUTHOR IS

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:06.341
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:08.176
COMMITTEE TO AMEND THE BILL TO

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:09.778
PERHAPS -- FITTED INTO THE

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:11.312
CURRENT MISSION BASED BUDGETING

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.947
FRAMEWORK AND WITH THAT

01:24:13.014 --> 01:24:14.749
COMMITMENT IN PLACE I'LL BE

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:16.017
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT IT
