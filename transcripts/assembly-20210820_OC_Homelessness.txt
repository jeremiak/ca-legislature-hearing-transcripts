AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON ORANGE COUNTY HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WELCOME TO OUR FIRST HEARING OF THIS SESSION HOWEVER WE HELD IT IN DISTRICT HEARING RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS AND BOY IN A PARK. TWO YEARS AGO. THIS TOPIC IS SOMETHING THAT I AM QUITE PASSIONATE ABOUT WORK TIRELESSLY ON AND BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS A COMMUNITY AS A COUNTY AS NEIGHBORS AS LOCAL ELECTED. AS LONG AS WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL IN MIND WHICH IS TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AND TO DO WHAT WE CAN TOGETHER TO SOLVE THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. THE GOAL FOR TODAY'S HEARING IS TO FOCUS ON THE PROGRESS THAT THE REGION HAS MADE WHAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND THE ROLE EACH ONE OF US CAN PLAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE MANY ROAD BALOCHS TO PROVIDING HOUSING FOR THE COUNTY'S GROWING POPULATION OF CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. PEOPLE AS WELL AS SERVICES FOR THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE ALSO KNOW THERE ARE NO SIMPLE ANSWERS TO ADDRESS SUCH COMPLEX PROBLEMS HOWEVER IT DOES TAKE DEDICATION AND COLLABORATION TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO LACK SAFE STABLE AND APPROPRIATE PLACES TO LIVE IN ORANGE COUNTY. AS WELL AS TO ACCESS VARIOUS LEVELS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. DID YOU KNOW THAT IN EVERY MONTH AND THE LAST CALENDAR YEAR IN ORANGE COUNTY ALMOST OR CLOSE TO THIRTY PEOPLE HAVE DIED ON ORANGE COUNTY STREETS. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE BETTER WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS CONTRIBUTING FACTORS OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ABUSE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND DEDICATION TO IF YOU ARE A SERVICE PROVIDER A NONPROFIT A HOUSING AND GIVE ADVOCATE A NEIGHBOR A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL COUNTY OFFICIAL WE KNOW THAT WHAT YOU DO MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS IN ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS AHEAD OF TIME AND ORGANIZATIONS AND ADVOCATES WELL WE WOULD NOT BE MAKING THE PROGRESS THAT WE ARE SEEN IN ORANGE COUNTY WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT. LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR PANELONE ON THIS PANEL IS FOCUSED ON MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY NEEDS IN SERVICES. I WILL JUST PUT A LITTLE HYPHEN HERE THAT IT'S NOT JUST HOMELESSNESS THAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT HAVE BEEN CRITICALLY AFFECTED WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AS WE KNOW WITH THE PANDEMIC. OUR STUDENTS PARENTS FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING NOT ONLY WITH THE FEAR OF THE VIBRANT VIRUS BUT ALSO LOSING ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF OF SCHOOLING. OUR FIRST PANELISTS ARE MISTER CLINTON CHILD WHO IS THE DIRECTOR AND COUNTY OFFICE OFFICER FOR THAT COUNTY HEALTH. HEALTH CARE AGENCY. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH MR CLAIMED SHALL ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS AND I'M DELIGHTED THAT HE IS HERE WITH US IN ADDITION WE HAVE MR MATH HOPE MATTHEW HOLES MAN WHO IS THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS LIAISON FOR NAOMI ORANGE COUNTY. AND DR HEATHER. HOOT SEE SORRY IS THE CHAIR OF THE DIVISION OF THE PEDIATRIC PSYCHIATRY FOR THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF ORANGE COUNTY OR BETTER KNOWN AS CHALK HOSPITAL. WITH THAT WE WELCOME YOU AND WE ARE GOING TO BEGAN WITH OUR FIRST PANELIST WITH WHO IS. MR CLAYTON SHALL. WELCOME GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIT SILVA AND DHEA HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO- ATTEMPTS TO YOU THIS MORNING- I'M DELIGHTED THAT I'M JOINED BY MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES HERE. I CAN KNOW EVERYBODY AND ALL THE PANELS THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER SO YOU GET THE RIGHT FOLKS TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND I'M A WOULD PLAZA I WOULD I WOULD START THE CONVERSATION. FROM A- COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF BRIGHT- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A MINUTE A MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY- ADDICTIONS AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE CRUCIAL AT THIS POINT IN A PANDEMIC. A PAST WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A THIRDS THIRDS FOURTH FOR SOME OF US ARE AS A NATION- I THINK THAT WOULD BE- CHILDREN COMING BACK TO SCHOOL AFTER BEING MOST OF THEM BEING OUT AT HOME IN THE LOCKDOWN FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS NOW. IT IS GONNA. TAKE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF. YEAH FOR THE TO THE- NO- AT THE END THAT WOULD INCLUDE A HOW TO KEEP HOW DO THEY KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE. AND NOT GET INFECTED. AND BRING BACK HOME ARE HOW DO THEY KEEP THEIR A CLASSMATE SAVE BY NOT BRINGING THE VIRUS. INTO THE SCHOOL AND SPREAD IT TO THEIR CLASSMATES BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KNOW AT THE NATIONAL EFFORT S. WALLS CALIFORNIA EFFORT WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS. AN EFFORT TO BRING ALL CHILDREN BACKED INTO IN PERSON EDUCATION BECAUSE WE KNOW. ONLINE EDUCATION. HAVE NOT WORKED OUT FOR THE YOUNGSTER AND WE HAVE SEEN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE DROPPED IN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THOSE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE FROM BONOBO COMMUNITIES- AND THEN WE'VE ALSO SEEN ANXIETY. AND QUESTIONS AND THOSE WHO'VE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR CLASSMATES BECAUSE THAT'S THE NATURE OF CHILDREN THEY NEED TO BE AMONG THEMSELVES. THEY NEED TO BE IN SCHOOL TO LEARN HOW TO SOCIALIZE WITH THEIR CLASSMATES AND HOW TO SOCIALIZE WITH THE ADULTS IN THEIR LIFE. AT THE TEACHER IN THE SCHOOL STAFF AND WHAT HAPPENED YOU SO WE ARE FACING- AT A CRITICAL TIME AND HOW DO WE PROVIDE A SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS. AND THEN FOR THE FAMILY THE PARENTS AT HOME WHO NERVOUS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MY KIDS WHAT THEY BRING THE VIRUS HOME ETCETERA AND THEN FALL TEACHER ESPECIALLY TEACHER WHO HAVE HOPE- WHAT IN HIGH RISK CATEGORY. I'LL TELL YOU THE COMMITMENT FROM THE TEACHERS OR TEACHER THAT I HEARD FROM IS JUST AMAZING MANY OF THEM ARE WILLING. TO BRING THE CHILDREN BACK TO WORK WITH THE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN IT EVEN THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES ARE PEOPLE AT THE HIGH RISK CATEGORY SO YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT MA'AM. WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A ROBUST SYSTEM MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. THAT WOULD SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY. IN THIS TIME AND TIME I DON'T- GIVEN WHAT OF MENTIONS AS A RELATED HOMELESS AND I MIGHT SOME THAT PEOPLE WILL THIS IS A WITH BUT THAT WHAT WHO ARE HOMELESS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTIONS AND ACCESS TO TREATMENT IS VERY COMPLEX AS YOU POINTED OUT IT'S NOT EASY I CAN TELL YOU IN ORANGE COUNTY JUST LIKE ANY OTHER COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA INDIVIDUAL WHO HAVE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS ON THE STREET I'M NOT STRANGER TO US. HEALTH SYSTEM WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE WE HAVE TRIED YEARS FOR YEARS TO ENGAGE THEM INTO TREATMENT BUT- IN OUR COUNTRY THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TREATMENT. IT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL. AND I'M IN MY OPINION THAT IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR US TO ENGAGE PEOPLE IN TREATMENT- ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF THEIR- EPISODE WHETHER IT BE SEVERE MANIA ARE SEVERE PSYCHOSIS- IS THAT THERE'S NOT THAT RECOGNITION THAT TREATMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR THAT BRACKET. AND SO YES WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS IN ORANGE COUNTY I'M SO PROUD OF THE PARTNERS IN THE PANEL WILL BE WORKING SO HARD FOR DECADES. TO TRY TO GET HOUSING ARE BOTH A RESIDENTS HERE IN IN IN ORANGE COUNTY BUT YOU KNOW THE HOUSING MARKET IN ORANGE COUNTY IT'S NOT A PERFECT PLACE FOR US TO DO THAT. IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND YOU CAN'T DO IT RIGHT AND I KNOW WE HAVE GOTTEN COOPERATION AND PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC AND PHILANTHROPIST AND WE MADE SOME HEADWAY. TO OF GARNER'S WE SOURCES TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING A FILE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL WHO ARE HOMELESS BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. PLEASE TELL PAPRIKA AND I'M AFRAID THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS EVEN COST MORE PEOPLE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS SO COMPOUNDED BY ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND ADDICTION RIGHT- ABOUT PAIN USE OF PICK UP A PRESCRIPTION PAINKILLERS. USE UP ILLICIT DRUGS ON TOP OF A PRISONER BEING HOMELESS. WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO ENTER INTO A PHASE MORE FACT FROM TO PREDICT TWO HOW TO DO THIS AND SO I KNOW I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MUCH TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO HEAR MY OTHER PARTNER. BUT BUT BUT STILL SOME ONE THING. WE HAVE GOT TO SUIT. ST MATTER. AND THAT MEANS WHAT HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAPPY. OF FOR. IS THE NURSES SOCIAL. COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER. UP OUT THERE ON THE STREETS SUPPORTING INDIVIDUAL ON THOSE TO GET FROM THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED- BUT MOST AT RISK BUT THE PLAN FORTUNATE PIECES IT IS NOT EASY FOR THEM TO GO INTO AN INDOOR PLACE TO ACCESS SERVICES. WE KNOW THAT IF I PUSH MY CARD WITH MY BELONGINGS AND YOU TELL ME TO GO TO A DOCTOR'S OFFICE ALSO SUPPORTS WORKERS OFFICE. WHO'S GOING TO WATCH OVER MY CARD UP ALL MY BELONGINGS RIGHT IT'S A WE HAVE. REALLY WE MUST AND UPON THAT HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE WAY ON IT'S HOW DO WE BRING ST MADISON ONTO THE STREET. AND REALLY TAKE CARE OF FOLKS WHO NEEDED IT AND THEN THE SECOND PIECE IS. HOUSING VOUCHERS OR A MOTEL VOUCHER HAVE TO BE EASILY pCOMMUNITY CLINIC FOR SERVICES. AND AT THAT POINT WHEN THE COMMUNITY CLINIC WORKER ASSESSMENT ONE OF THEM THE VOUCHER AVAILABLE FOR ME IF I NEED HELP TO GET INTO A TO GET INTO A SHELTER WHILE I'M- TRYING TO GET MY CONDITION STABILIZED BY. GOOD THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WON'T QUALIFY FOR LUCRATIVE CARE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA HAVE CERTAIN CONDITIONS IN ORDER FOR YOU TO MEET THE CRITERIA. CARE WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO NOT THAT BAD THEY DON'T MEET THAT KIND OF HELP BUT THEY JUST NEED TO GET STABILIZED DO WE HAVE A HOTEL VOUCHER. READILY AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO ACCESS RIGHT AND THEN LASTLY I WANT TO HOP ON TO THIS ISSUE- OF THAT THAT THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TREATMENT WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE OF THE MENTAL ILLNESS BECAUSE THIS IS A COMMUNITY OF ADDICTION IT IS NOT EASY FOR THEM TO STAY AT HOME. EVEN IF WE GO WITH THE HOUSING FOR AND GAVE THEM. A AN APARTMENT TO STATE BECAUSE THEY DON'T. WHAT EVENTUALLY. COST THEM BELIEVE THAT OF SHELTER WE KNOW THAT I SEE AS A COUPLE MAKE NOT THAT. WE KNOW THIS FOR A LONG TIME NOW BUT BECAUSE OF REGULATION- WE NOT ABLE TO DO MORE I WOULDN'T SAY MORE BUT WE NOT ABLE TO DO WHAT IS APPROPRIATE. TO TAKE CARE OF THESE FOLKS SO WITH THAT I WILL AND EAGERLY AWAITING TO HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY WOMAN AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER THANK YOU FOR GIVING US A PLATFORM TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE KNOW AND HOPING THAT YOU IN THAT HONORABLE COMMITTEE WOULD HELP US. PROVIDE POLICY BRINGING RESOURCE TO ORANGE COUNTY FOR US TO CREATE A REALLY SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR EVERYBODY. TO ATTRACT SEPTIC YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MA'AM MISTER CHAU READ.

ON COUNCIL WHICH WAS ALMOST ELEVEN YEARS WITH THE- KELLY THOMAS CASE WHERE WE HAD- ARE HORRIFIC ENCOUNTER WITH THE SCHIZOPHRENIC YOUNG MAN IN FULLER TEN. WE TRAIN OUR POLICE A SOME OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS THIS WAS ELEVEN YEARS AGO AND IN IN MANY WAYS THAT THAT CASE MADE NATIONAL NEWS INTERNATIONAL NEWS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CONTINUES TO DRIVE MY FOCUS. IS WHAT CAN THE PUBLIC DO BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE THAT AND WITH THAT TWENTY PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- WHETHER YOU'RE DRIVING BY YOU SEE SOMEBODY LAYING OUT OF PARK WHETHER YOU SEE SOMEBODY LIKE YOU SAY DRAGGING THREE AND FOUR CARDS WHETHER YOU SEE SOMEONE THAT. DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE NOT HAD ANY TYPE OF A SUPPORT WHETHER IT BE FOOD OR- WHEN THEY NEED HELP. I KNOW WE DO HAVE SOME COMMUNITY GROUPS OUT THERE LIKE WOUND WALK WHO ARE OUT THERE AND AS YOU SAID GETTING PEOPLE OUT INTO THE FIELD TO HELP. ADDRESS MEDICAL CONDITIONS BUT IS THERE A CONTACT IS THERE A WAY THAT JUST OF INDIVIDUAL. COULD DO% SOMETHING IF THEY SEE SOMEBODY IN CRISIS. YES YES MA'AM AND IN ORANGE COUNTY- WE ARE TRYING TO A STANDARDIZED AND- MOVE TOWARDS A SINGLE NUMBER FOR PEOPLE TO CONTACT BECAUSE AS YOU PROBABLY ARE WELL AWARE IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS BUT I ACTUALLY VIGOROUSLY OVER A DOZEN THE PHONE NUMBER THAT YOU COULD CALL AND IT'S CREATES SO MUCH CONFUSION AND THEN SOME PEOPLE ENDED UP CALLING NINE ONE ONE RIGHT AND THEN WE'LL BALK AUTOMOTIVES THE ROOM IT UNNECESSARILY BOMBARDED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THERE APPROPRIATELY RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHERS OTHER PLACES THAT. TO DIRECTLY TO UP A PUBLICLY AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT IN ORANGE COUNTY IF YOU ENCOUNTER A SITUATION LIKE THIS YEAR PRICES YOU NEED CARE. DOESN'T MATTER WHICH PHONE YOU HAVE CALL- SEEDLINGS ARE O. . L. I. N. K. S. AND IF YOU ASK ME WHAT IS THE NUMBER I'M CONSIDERED GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK IT UP BUT IT'S VRY EASY. IT'S ALMOST THE LENGTH.

NEXT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO MR MATTHEW HOLES MAN WHO IS THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS LIAISON FOR NOW ME AND AGAIN SOMETIMES WHEN WE'RE IN- OFFICES WE LEARN ACRONYMS. AND NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT NOW ME MEANS NOW ME IS THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS AND MANY COUNTIES AND CITIES HAVE CHAPTERS SO THIS IS OUR ORANGE COUNTY LIAISON MR MATTHEW WHOLESOME WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE PANELISTS AND GUESTS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS MATT HOLZMAN AND I'M CHAIR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL DISORDERS COUNTY AFFILIATE. AMY ORANGE COUNTY REPRESENTS INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE ARE A NATIONAL VOICE FOR THE VOICELESS. OUR MISSION IS TO EDUCATE THE DE STIGMATIZE MENTAL ILLNESSES AND TO EMPOWER INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO BECOME THE BEST POSSIBLE VERSIONS OF OURSELVES. IN ORDER TO DO THIS NAME YOU WANT TO COUNTY HAS A WIDE RANGE OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR FAMILIES AND CAREGIVERS. INDIVIDUALS WILL PUT EXPERIENCE. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS. ALL THAT AT NO COST. EDUCATION HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOL IN REDUCING HOSPITALIZATIONS AND IMPROVING OUTCOMES AND THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THIS. WHEN THE FAMILY AN INDIVIDUAL OR EDUCATED INVOLVED BETTER DECISIONS CAN BE MADE AND FRICTION IS REDUCED. THIS CORRECTION IS AT THE HEART OF OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO MENTAL ILLNESS. I'M HERE AS WELL AS A PARENT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. TWO OF OUR CHILDREN WERE ON THE STREETS AND SUFFERED FROM ADDICTION. AND SMR. ONE DIED BY SUICIDE THE OTHERS IN RECOVERY. I'VE SPENT TIME COMBAT COMBING THE STREETS FOR CHILDREN WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE JAILS BETTER TREATMENT FACILITIES. THE TRUMP EARNED. WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND MORE IMPORTANTLY MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THE HOMELESS IN ORANGE COUNTY. MUCH HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE TO DO. IN ORANGE COUNTY WE DON'T HAVE OUTREACH WORKERS CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS TO SERVICES. WE'RE ALSO PILOTING PROGRAMS APPEAR A CLINICIAN AND APPEAR TO RESPOND TO MENTAL HEALTH GOALS RATHER THAN ONE FORSMAN. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT ON HOUSING FIRST INITIATIVES. AND THE BE WELL SITE IN ORANGE IS IN FULL OPERATION. BUT THE ESSENCE OF PREVENTION IS EDUCATION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. WE'RE THE SYSTEM FALLS DOWN IS AFTER THE CRISIS. INDIVIDUALS STABILIZE BUT WHAT THEN. WE DO NOT HAVE WARM HAND OFFS OFTEN NOT HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL HAS NO ALTERNATIVE BUT THE STREETS. THERE IS NO OFTEN NO ROOM AT THE END. WHEN OUR SON DIED HE WAS DISCHARGED FROM A PSYCHIATRIC UNIT DOSED WITH THE COCKTAIL OF MEDICATIONS. THE CLOTHES ON HIS BACK. SOME PRESCRIPTIONS AND IT WAS PASSED WITH THE INSTRUCTION TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IF YOU FELT SUICIDAL OR HOMICIDAL. THREE HOURS LATER HE WAS DEAD. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. IN WORKING WITH COLLEAGUES IN EUROPE I'VE LEARNED THE TRUE NATURE OF WRAPAROUND CARE. BRICKS AND MORTAR OR A PART OF THE ANSWER. BUT CONDITIONS HAVE TO GO WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES NOT WAIT FOR DISASTER TO WIN ON THEIR DOORSTEP. HOUSING AND THE RIGHT KIND OF HOUSING IS CRITICAL. INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AT DIFFERENT STAGES. SOMETIMES IT IS BEHIND A LOCKED DOOR FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY. THEN MAYBE IN A NON WALKED ENVIRONMENT. BETTER TO STEP DOWN HOUSING. THEN IT MAY BE A GROUP HOME OR WITH FAMILY AND ISN'T THAT REALLY THE ULTIMATE GOAL. WE NEED SERVICES AND HOUSING AT ALL THE STAGES. WE DON'T HAVE NEARLY ENOUGH. THE ECONOMICS OF GROUP HOUSING SIMPLY DON'T WORK AND YET THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER MENTAL HOSPITALS IN EUROPE EXACTLY BECAUSE THEY FOUND THAT THESE OPTIONS WORK. HAVING THE CONDITIONS GO TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND PATIENT CENTERED CARE WORKS. M. INVOLVEMENT WORKS. THE COST OF HOMELESSNESS IN WASTED WIVES AS A NATIONAL STATE. ACOSTA DOLLARS IS TREMENDOUS WE NEED TO DO BETTER. HOUSING AT EACH LEVEL OF CARE CASE MANAGEMENT CLINICAL SERVICES. CRISIS INTERVENTION IN SUPPORT OF PROGRAMS CAN HELP US TO OFFER A WAY UP AND OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. WE MUST WORK HOLISTICALLY AND BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS BETWEEN SILOS OF EXPERTISE. WHEN YOU COOPERATION AND COOPERATION AND FAMILY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. ON BEHALF OF ANY ORANGE COUNTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER HOLTZMAN AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORY AND I AM SO SORRY FOR THE LOSS OF YOUR SON- I TO HAVE LOST A BROTHER- TWO AND NOT ONLY ADDICTION BUT- WHO DEALT WITH HOMELESSNESS AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE IN THAT TO. IF YOU WANT TO SAY GROUP WHO HAVE ENDURED THIS WE KNOW THAT MANY TIMES. THERE IS THE STIGMA WE KNOW THERE'S THAT BLAME. I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY INSINUATING THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST FAMILY MEMBERS TO THE STREETS ARE ADDICTIONS HAVE NEVER TRIED TO DO THAT HAVE NEVER TRIED TO MAKE INTERVENTIONS- MISTER HUSBAND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO. THOSE THAT SAY THINGS LIKE WELL THAT'S GREAT ALL THESE INTERVENTIONS YOU WANT BUT WE DON'T WANT HIM IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WE DON'T WANT HIM IN OUR CITY AND WE DON'T WANT TO MEN ARE COUNTY BECAUSE- THEY BRING CRIME AND DRUGS AND- AND- WE JUST DON'T WANT TO HEAR. WELL THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE FROM ORANGE COUNTY ORIGINALLY ANYWAY. SO MOST OF THEM HAVE FAMILY HERE. THEY HAVE FRIENDS HERE. BOB THEY HAVE SERIOUS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE- AND SO WE HAVE TO TREAT THEM AS OUR OWN. AND THIS IS THIS IS ALL PART OF A CONTINUUM OF CARE. SO WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AS- WHERE DO WE WORK WE- ENGAGE PEOPLE WHERE WE HAVE THEM. BOB GETTING SERVICES AND AS I AM AS I MENTIONED IN EUROPE B. CLINICIANS OFTEN GO TO THE INDIVIDUAL. AND THAT'S NOT CHEAP BUT WE HAVE TO BALANCE THE COST OF DOING THAT VERSUS THE COSTS OF INCARCERATION AND BOB. HOSPITALIZATION AND THE COST IN THE EMERGENCY ROOMS SO WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AS A HOLISTIC OUR SYSTEM. AND I DON'T THINK WE DO GET. AND I DO APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AS I DO THINK ORANGE COUNTY DOES HAVE MANY MODELS THAT ARE BEST PRACTICE MODELS AND WHERE WE HAVE I THINK HAVE SOME. VERY BRIGHT STARS I KNOW THAT MANY MANY IF NOT ALL CITIES WHOSE SOME INDIVIDUAL HOMES THAT WE REALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE OF COURSE WE WANT TO KEEP. THOSE HOMES PRIVATE WHETHER IT'S FOR ABUSED WOMEN WHETHER THEY'RE SHELTERS FOR FAMILY AND WHETHER THEIR GROUP HOMES BECAUSE WE KNOW. IT TOO OFTEN IF THESE HOMES ARE PUT ON A LIST- SOMETIMES FOR NO APPARENT REASON OTHER THAN PEOPLE DON'T WANT THAT TYPE OF HOMES. IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD THEY COULD BE AT RISK OF BEING SHUT DOWN. ON THE OTHER HAND WE CERTAINLY KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES WITH SOME GROUP HOMES NOT BEING REGULATED- AND THIS IS ALSO CAUSED- THE TIDE TO TURN AGAINST SOME OF THE SUPPORTIVE. SERVICES WHEN WE HAVE BAD ACTORS SO THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE BUT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. I IF YOU COULD PUT A PHONE NUMBER IN THERE FOR AGAIN I'M LOOKING AT BEING ABLE TO GET FAMILIES CONNECTED TO TAP NOW ME BECAUSE I DO KNOW. MANY FAMILIES STRUGGLE SILENTLY THEY HAVE NO WEAR OR IDEA I SHOULD SAY WHO TO TURN TO SO WHAT WOULD BE THEIR FIRST STOP IN TRYING TO ACCESS ONLY SERVICES BUT HELP FOR THEM NOT ONLY THEMSELVES AS THE FAMILY. BUT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT STRUGGLING. WELL THE FIRST STOP WOULD BE THE WARM WATER. AND SALT PUT THAT IN THE TRAP. I DON'T HAVE IT HANDY AT THE MOMENT BUT I'LL I'LL CALL IT UP AND I WILL- WHAT IT- OUT THERE SO THAT. WE CAN CALL AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN PROVIDE. A CONNECTION TO SERVICES THERE TO LISTEN- MOST THE MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE SO THEY WALKED IN THE SAINT JUDE'S IS PEOPLE CALLING. SO IT'S A VERY IT'S A VERY EMPATHETIC AND A VERY- USEFUL- RUBBER TO THE ROAD GOT A SERVICE THAT WE OFFER. AND DESPITE. WANTED MUCH BY THE COUNTY. THAT MATTER I DO HAVE THE NUMBER TO THE WARM LINE OKAY. ASSEMBLY WOMAN THE NUMBER TO THE ONE LINE IT'S EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. NINE ONE ZERO NINE TWO SEVEN SIX- SO IF YOU ARE LISTENING A SECOND. SUPPORT IS THE WARM LINE AGAIN RUN BY THE COUNTY OF ORANGE EMPATHETIC LISTENERS A FIRST PLACE TO START. IF YOU OR IN AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILY MEMBER YOU KNOW IS STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN NINE ONE ZERO. NINE TWO SEVEN SIX MY TEAM WILL BE TAKING EXPLICIT NOTES AND MAKING SURE WE GET THIS OUT AS WELL BUT TWO NUMBERS- SEE LINK. THIS IS IF YOU SEE SOMEBODY MAYBE NOT A FAMILY MEMBER OR SOMEBODY THAT YOU SEE ON CRISIS- YOU CAN CALL THIS NUMBER- SEE LINK. EIGHT FIVE FIVE SIX TWO FIVE FOUR SIX FIVE SEVEN. WARM LINE WOULD BE IF YOU OR A FAMILY FAMILY MEMBER IS STRUGGLING AND YOU NEED A FIRST STOP HELP- TO START TO NAVIGATE THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. NINE ONE ZERO NINE TWO SEVEN SIX. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MISTER A HOLES MEN FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- WE APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'RE DOING DELAYED ORANGE COUNTY'S NAOMI. BRANCH OUR LAST SPEAKER ON OUR FIRST PANEL OR IS NOW DR HEATHER HOOT SEE WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE DIVISION OF PEDIATRIC PSYCHIATRY FOR THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF ORANGE COUNTY BETTER KNOWN AS CHOP. WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY WOMEN WORK STILL BUT STILL APPRECIATE YOUR- COMMITMENTS- Q. FIVE MENTAL HEALTH AND- DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN- I- THE NEW YEAR AND I BELIEVE THE SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS AND THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- AS DOCTOR CHAO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT I'M GONNA START UPSTREAM A LITTLE BIT WITH ARE YOU. OP BECAUSE REALLY THE BEST WAY TO START TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS IS REALLY TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR OUR YOUTH AND- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE PARTICULARLY STARTING IN YOU. WE NEED TO OUT SO MANY OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO PREVENT IN SOCIETY INCLUDING HOMELESSNESS BUT ALSO ADDICTION EARLY INCARCERATION DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOLS- WE NEED TO PUT THAT THAT EMPHASIS ON ARE YOU. I WANTED TO JUST CENTER US FOR A MINUTE IN THE IN A COUPLE OF STATISTICS- AND DATA UP PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN HAD A DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER DURING THEIR CHILDHOOD. THAT IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND YOUTH IN ORANGE COUNTY OP BUT ONLY ABOUT A THIRD ACTUALLY RECEIVE SERVICES I'M AS DOCTOR CHAO TALKED ABOUT WITH THE PANDEMIC- BECAUSE OF ISOLATION- THE STRESSORS I. FAMILY STRUGGLE WITH INCOME WE'VE SEEN A TREMENDOUS INCREASE THE NEEDS ARE JUST FIGURES FROM CHOC CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF ORANGE COUNTY- THAT OUTSIDE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED DURING THE PANDEMIC SO WE STARTED WITH ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN- HERE'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC WE'VE HAD AN INCREASE IN CALLS OUT LOOKING FOR OUTPATIENT SERVICES. UP BY TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT- WE'VE HAD A 27% INCREASE IN OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITH OUR KIDS COMING IN WITH PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS HE'S MOSTLY SUICIDAL IDEATION- I WILL SAY TWO NIGHTS AGO WE HAD SEVEN CHILDREN- IN R. E. D. AWAITING PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT BEDS- WE'VE SEEN WITH SCHOOL RE OPENING AS DOCTORS HAVE TALKED ABOUT WE'VE SEEN. A BIG INCREASE AGAIN I'M IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN COMING IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH INPATIENT CENTER- SHOWED THROUGHOUT. THE PANDEMIC AND INCREASED CENSUS AND HI A Q. SO CHILLED WHO ARE CO IN SEEING MORE. COME IN AND- THEY'RE TAKE ILLNESSES ARE WORSE SO THAT- IT'S TAKING EVEN MORE CARE- AND LONGER TO ADDRESSTHEIR ISSUES- WE'VE SEEN A- WE ACTUALLY ACT CONSULT ON OUR MEDICAL- INPATIENT UNIT- AND ART PSYCHOLOGY CONSOLES OVER THIS PAST YEAR. HAVE INCREASED BY A 100% OF OUR CHILDREN WHO HAD- WE MADE A SUICIDE ATTEMPT SERIOUS ENOUGH TO REQUIRE HOSPITALIZATION. AND ARE EATING DISORDERS HAVE HAVE SKYROCKETED I IN THE YEAR PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WE- HOSPITALIZED SIXTY PATIENTS FOR MEDICAL STABILIZATION FOR AN EATING DISORDER- THIS LAST FISCAL YEAR SO. JULY THREE THROUGH JUNE OF THIS YEAR WE HOSPITALIZED A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN PATIENTS OPT FOR CARE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT'S A MASSIVE INCREASE- I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION WE ASK AND I KNOW DOCTOR JOHN I JUST WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ABOUT HOW LONG WILL THESE ATTACKS LAST BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS THAT. THAT SORT OF. SENSE OF HOPEFULNESS THAT. MAYBE IF THIS GETS ALL OVER AND WE GET KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL ALL THE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS WILL WILL LEAVE. AND I. I'M A LITTLE WORRIED- AS I KNOW DOCTOR CHAO IS AS WELL- AND I KNOW THAT I MISTER HOLTZMAN TO. IS WITH THE WITH THE LITERATURE ON DISASTERS WHICH ARE MUCH MORE CRIME LIMITED VOCAL- EVENTS THAN WHAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE PANDEMIC. CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THE LAST FOR. THREE TO FIVE YEARS. AFTER THE EVENTS HAS HAS FINISHED AND WE'VE SEEN AS INCREASES IN. DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. IN THESE OTHER- DISASTERS- AND WE'VE SEEN SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH H. ONE N. ONE AND- NOT SARS AT SO. I THINK WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR THIS IS NOT A SHORT TERM PROBLEM. AT THIS ELEVATED RISK OF THE LONG TERM PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT. HOW DO WE TREAT OUR CHILDREN. S. B. E. R. R. ASSEMBLY WOMAN NETWORKS SILVA AS WELL AS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD ASKED US. ARE WE COLLABORATING AND I DO THINK ONE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT ORANGE COUNTY. IS THAT REAL SENSE THAT WE MUST COME TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER AND I THINK YOU KNOW ALL ALL OF US ON THE PANEL OR LIKE- YOU'LL- TALK WITH YOU- THERE IS THAT GREAT SENSE OF COLLABORATION WHICH I THINK WILL ALLOW US. HAS ALLOWED US TO MAKE THE STRIDES WE HAVE- AND WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO MAKE STRIDES UNDER YOU KNOW DOCTOR CHAO'S LEADERSHIP AND OTHERS- IN ORANGE COUNTY. SO WE DO COLLABORATE VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR ORANGE COUNTY HEALTH CARE AGENCY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. OUT WITH HOW OPTIMA WITH THE WHILE SYSTEM OF CARE TASK FORCE- BRINGS TOGETHER- PEOPLE FROM ABROAD FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF PLACES THAT- ARE LOOKING. AT CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- INCLUDING THIS THE FAITH BASED COMMUNITY AS WELL AS- HOSPITALS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY AGENCIES SOCIAL SERVICE SERVICES AGENCY- ARE ORANGE COUNTY. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO DISCUSS THESE KIND AND THE **** YOU KNOW WE CONTINUED. EXPAND COOPER AND THAT IS THE WAY IF THINK OF. PART OF THE PANDEMIC WE HAD A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND KIDS WE NEEDED TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR WE CAN ONLY DO THAT TOGETHER NO ONE ENTITY CAN DO IT A LOT- I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME GOOD NEWS BECAUSE I KNOW ALL OF THAT CAN BE KIND OF A DOWNER ABOUT. WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON OF WHAT HAVE WE BEEN DOING. A LOT OF THIS WITH SUPPORT OF BOTH CAL OPTIMA AND THE ORANGE COUNTY. HEALTH CARE AGENCY UP WE'VE DONE SOME PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION LAST YEAR WE GET OVER A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE. I TRAINING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY REGENE- ALMOST EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED RESIDENTS IN ORANGE COUNTY. UP TO THAT POINT OF HOW DO WE LET PEOPLE KNOW. WHAT'S GOING ON BACK HI MR HOLTZMAN'S POINTS. OUT WE DID BEGIN SERVICES AT MATER DEI HIGH SCHOOL SO WE WERE OUT THERE- DEVELOPING SORT OF A WELLNESS CULTURE AND- AND PREVENTION SERVICES. WE HAVE A CONSULTATION LINE FOR PEDIATRICIANS AND SCHOOLS THAT- WHEN PEDIATRICIANS ARE CONFRONTED WITH A CHILD IN THEIR CLINIC AND THEY'RE LIKE. QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM THEY CAN CALL US THEY CAN TALK TO OUR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIST IF THEY'RE GONNA START MEDICATION. OR TALK WITH ONE OF OUR SOCIAL WORKERS ABOUT RESOURCES OR TREATMENT. WE ALSO WHICH I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT EFFORT- AND THROUGH THE SUPPORT OF PELLATT. ABBVIE CAL OPTIMA WE- HAVE INTEGRATED PSYCHOLOGIST INTO OUR PEDIATRICIANS OFFICES- SERVING A LARGE- MEDICAID POPULATION WHICH ALLOW WITH ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN EARLIER BECAUSE WE'RE DOING IT AT REGULAR SCREENINGS. AND WHAT WE SEE IS A TREMENDOUSLY GREATER UPTAKE AND SERVICES BECAUSE IT'S BEING PROVIDED BY A TRUSTED PROVIDER- AND LAST YEAR WE STARTED. THIS PROCESS IN OCTOBER- OF LAST YEAR AND- FROM OCTOBER TO JUNE WE SERVED OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED FAMILIES- IN OUR FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION. PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- IN TERMS OF JUST TO KEEP YOUR SERVICES ARE INPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH CENTER I JUST WANT TO MENTION- IT. JUST AS YOU WANT IT SAY WHAT ARE SOME THINGS WERE LEADING THE WAY ON AN ORANGE COUNTY- MANY ARE PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT UNITS- HAVE ABOUT A 33% RATE OF RETURN OF RESTRAINTS USED ON KIDS WHEN THEY'RE HOSPITALIZED. DUE TO JUST- WHAT A LOT OF REACH IT'S TO IT'S- COMPLEX WE NEED- HAVE REALLY INVESTED IN- BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS TRAINING OUR GROUP. ARE STRAIGHT RATE IS LESS THAN ONE PERCENTAGE POINT ONE PERCENT- AND OUR CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS ARE ZERO PERCENT- OUR INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM- ACTUALLY IS A PROGRAM THAT WORKS IT PROVIDES VERY INTENSIVE SERVICES. AND IN THE SIX MONTHS FOLLOWING UP PETER ALL CHILDREN WHO WERE AT RISK. OF BEING HOSPITALIZED FOR PSYCHIATRIC REASONS OR HAD JUST BEEN DISCHARGED TO MISTER HOLTZMAN POINT OF HEY WHEN WE DISTRACT YOU FROM AN INPATIENT UNIT WHAT IS THE WRAP AROUND WHAT IS THE SERVICE YOU GET. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS THAT INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM WHERE. KIDS COME FOUR DAYS A WEEK FOR THREE HOURS AT A TIME- IN THE SIX MONTHS AFTER KIDS GRADUATE FROM THE PROGRAM WE'VE SEEN LESS THAN 1% OF THEM GET RE ADMITTED TO THE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL SO PROGRAM THAT WORKS. AND ALSO TO THE POINT OF WRAPAROUND SERVICES ARE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP- THAT WORKS WITH KIDS WITH MEDICAL DISORDERS AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS- WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS PARTICULARLY IN EATING DISORDERS- AND WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD SUCCESS THERE SO THERE ARE PROGRAMS OUT THERE. THAT'S JUST A SMALL SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING THE CHOCOLATE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS HAPPENING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY- SO THERE IS GOOD NEWS IN ALL OF THIS. IN TERMS OF NEEDS FOR THE COMMUNITY THE I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS- WE DO HAVE A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR OUTPATIENT CARE- I KNOW WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE'S MONEY- GOING TO CHILDREN'S. HEALTH CARE AT CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR SCHOOL- I THINK THAT IDEA OF WHAT'S- WHERE WHERE WHERE KIDS ARE AND LET'S BE SURE THAT WE HAVE A HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL OF CARE AVAILABLE- I THINK OF A VERY IMPORTANT PART FOR THAT MONEY TO COME TO ORANGE COUNTY AND BEAT. RB SPENCER- IN IN THAT WAY AND EXPANDING THOSE OUTPATIENT CARE OPPORTUNITIES THAT COLLABORATION WITH PEDIATRICIANS. WERE NEVER GONNA HAVE ENOUGH CHILD AN ADULT ESSENCE LIKE HYATT. OUT WE ONLY HAVE THOUSAND IN THE ENTIRE- SO IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO RAMP UP BUT WE CAN. LEVERAGE OUR PEDIATRICIANS IF THEY HAVE SUPPORT AND CARE SO. I'M CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THOSE KINDS OF CONSULTATION LINES OUT WOULD BE IMPORTANT- UNFORTUNATELY INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS- ARE NOT. PAID FOR BY MEDICAID HOW AT THIS POINT IN TIME- IT SO I THINK IF WE COULD EXPAND THE SERVICES- TO INCLUDE I. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL OR DISSIPATE IN THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH WE KNOW OUR SUCCESSFUL- AND I THINK WE COULD USE SOME OF THE MONEY THAT'S COMING OUT FOR EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS. TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES ARE ACROSS THE COMMUNITY OPT FOR THAT. PORTION OF KIDS WHO NEED IT I'M AND THEN OUR COLLABORATION WITH SCHOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT AS THAT MONEY'S GOING INTO THE SCHOOLS. FOR MENTAL HEALTH THAT THAT THERE IS ACCESS TO EVIDENCE BASED OUT WORK- AND THINGS THAT WE KNOW WORK RATHER THAN MONEY GOING- AND BEING SPENT ON THINGS THAT THAT PERHAPS WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL. I SO APPRECIATE YOU- EVERYONE'S ATTENTION AND- YOUR UPBRINGING AT BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. TO THE FOREFRONT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR DOCTOR HEATHER WHO SEE- I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET AND SPEAK WITH YOUR TEAM ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS NOW AND ALSO TOUR THE HOSPITAL. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE NOTE OF SOME OF THE DATA THAT YOU SHARED WHICH IS- IT IS STARK WHEN WE LOOK AT EACH STUDENTS RETURNING TO SCHOOL WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS. THAT THEY'VE ENDURED- NOT JUST THROUGH THE PANDEMIC BUT IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WHETHER IT'S ON CAMPUS- SHOOTINGS WHETHER IT'S- YOU SOME OF THE VERY BASIC THINGS THAT WE DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT ANYMORE. BUT THAT ARE WE KNOW WERE VERY TRAUMATIC THE LIKE DIVORCE AND YET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING STILL ECHOES THE FORMER SPEAKERS. WHICH IS THAT IF WE CAN GET TO THESE YOUNG INDIVIDUALS EARLY AND HAVE THESE INTERVENTIONS OR HAVE THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS. WE'RE GOING TO BE LESS LIKELY TO SEE THIS TRANSLATE INTO. MAJOR CONCERNS AS ADULTS SO I'M ALWAYS VERY INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT THAT EARLY INTERVENTIONS TALKING ABOUT. HOW DO WE- TRY TO PREVENT SOME OF THE EARLY ISSUES WE MIGHT SEE AND AGAIN WORKING WITH OUR EDUCATORS I THINK IS VITAL. I'M REALLY PROUD THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING OUR MYSELF ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. AND THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. TO WORK TOWARD SOME LEGISLATION THAT WILL SAY- LET'S MAKE SURE WE HAVE EARLIER CONNECTIONS WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR STUDENTS WHO NEED. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT OF COURSE WITH PARENT SUPPORT. I HAVE NOT IN LIEU OF PARENTS BUT WITH PARENTS SUPPORT. I WAS VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT ONE PROJECT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU OPENED IT YET. BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS AND WHAT A PARK HIGH SCHOOL YOU WERE GOING TO BE DOING A. A WELLNESS ROOM IS THAT IF YOU GIVE ME MY JOB ABOUT THAT. AND THAT AGAIN WOULD. YES CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT. YEAH WE LOVE TO SO- ARE- POPULATION HEALTH GROUP HAS- WORKED WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT OF EDUCATION- AT ISSUE- CREATE WHAT WE CALL WELL SPACES SO IT'S WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AND WHEN A PARK HIGH SCHOOL IS INDEED ONE OF ONE OF THE PLACES THAT ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A RESUME THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO HELP SUPPORT CHILDREN'S. MENTAL HEALTH- IN SORT OF GIVING YOU THAT THAT SPACE THAT'S- A RESPITE FROM SCHOOL BUT ALSO CAN TEAMS IN IT ARE COPING SKILLS MEDICATION UP PROMPTS- ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT KIND OF HELP SUPPORT CHILDREN'S. MENTAL HEALTH AND THE SCHOOL COMMITS TO HAVING A FULL TIME- EMPLOYEE IN THAT SPACE USUALLY A SCHOOL COUNSELOR AT TO HELP THE POOR CHILDREN AND HELP ENCOURAGE THEM TO USE THOSE SERVICES AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CAN- CHALKER OTHER GROUPS HELP SUPPORT WITHIN THAT SPACE OUT FOR THAT EARLY INTERVENTION SO WE'RE SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY WOMAN PARTS OF UPPER. OUT REMEMBERING THAT IN POINTING THAT OUT. I DO BECAUSE AGAIN AS AN EDUCATOR MYSELF FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS I REALLY BELIEVE THAT ON SO MANY FRONTS ARE ARE YOUNG VERY YOUNG CHILDREN NINETY TODDLERS TO ADULTS- BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH WE KNOW IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE USING NOW AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE OPERATE. BUT IT IS A VERY LOUD NOISE WHEN KIDS ARE USING IT WITHOUT ANY CONTROLS WE KNOW THAT THE LIGHTS ARE FOR US YOUNG KIDS OR FALLING ASLEEP WITH DEVICES IN THEIR HANDS. UP ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR YOUNG GIRLS SEEN IMAGES THOUSANDS OF THEM BY THE TIME THEY'RE TEN AND TWELVE HAS LED TO SOME OF THESE EATING DOES DISORDERS SO HAVING SPACES ON CAMPUSES OR WITHIN GROUPS THAT THEY CAN GO TO KIND OF MOVE AWAY FROM SOME OF THAT JUST CHATTERING NOISE. I THINK IS GOING TO START TO PUT THE BACK INTO SPACE WHERE THEY CAN UP CALM THE BRAIN DOWN IF YOU WANT TO SAY THAT WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO US AS ADULTS. AND WE'VE SEEN THIS PLAY OUT WHERE WERE WHETHER IT'S- NEW SOURCES SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS THAT WE ARE SEEING PEOPLE GET ANGRIER AND ANGRIER AND ANGRIER. AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A BALLOON WE'VE SEEN- RESPONSES OF HATE AND SOME OF ITS BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE IMOGENE WERE SEEN. IT REALLY IS PUSHING PEOPLE TO A POINT OF- OF DOING THINGS THEY MAY NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF DONE IN THE PAST BUT AGAIN WE APPRECIATE TRUCK COSTS BUT OF AN ORANGE COUNTY WE KNOW YOU'RE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND WE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU. OKAY UP SO SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT I'M TALKING WITH OUR PANELISTS WE DO HAVE A COMMITTEE FOR ORANGE COUNTY A SELECT COMMITTEE ON HOMELESSNESS MY- SELECT GROUP PARTICIPANTS WEREN'T ABLE TO MAKE IT I WILL SPEAK UP ON THEIR BEHALF OF FRIDAY IN SACRAMENTO IS A WHO IS A VERY QUIET DAY AND MANY TIMES- ARE PARTICIPANTS ON THIS COMMITTEE- ARE ALREADY ENGAGED IN THEIR DISTRICTS BUT OUR OTHER MEMBERS INCLUDE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SABRINA CERVANTES ASSEMBLY MEMBER LAURIE DAVIS FROM ORANGE COUNTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER JANET NGUYEN FROM ORANGE COUNTY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COUNTY PETRIE-NORRIS FROM ORANGE COUNTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FREDDIE RODRIGUEZ FROM THE CHINO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BE GOT GAL SANTIAGO FROM LOS ANGELES SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE I'M DOING A LOT OF TALKING IT'S BECAUSE OF THE OF THE ONLY ONE HERE PARTICIPATING- BUT I KNOW SOME OF THEIR TEAMS ARE ARE LISTENING IN AS WELL AS MANY OTHER ELECTED TO AN ORANGE COUNTY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE PARTICIPATING AS A LOCAL ELECTED COUNTY OR EVEN OTHERS FROM OUR A HOUSING. FOR OUR HOMELESS COMMUNITY OR ADVOCATES I THINK YOU BECAUSE AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED NONE OF US ARE GOING TO SOLVE SOLVE THIS ISSUE INDIVIDUALLY AND WE NEED COALITIONS IN COLOR COLLABORATIONS TO DO THE VERY BEST WE CAN IN ORANGE COUNTY OUR SECOND PANDA PANEL IS IN AGAIN THANK YOU TO OUR AMAZING SPEAKERS ON OUR FIRST PANEL OUR SECOND PANEL IS GOING TO NOW- WHAT I'M GOING TO WELCOME IN AND DO IN REDUCE THEM AND THIS NEXT PANEL WOULD BE FOCUSING ON MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESSNESS. THROUGH INTEGRATED COMMUNITY. PARTNERSHIPS AND PROGRAMS. AND JUST TO SET THE STATE FOR ORANGE COUNTY. SOME OF. OUR LISTENERS MIGHT KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN NOT ONLY A BULLDOG- AND SOME MIGHT CALL ME OTHER NAME IS AN ORANGE COUNTY RELATED HOMELESS AND HOUSING- BUT- I'M ALSO. THANKFUL FOR WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO EVEN THOUGH HAS BEEN SAID I'M VERY PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE DONE THERE'S MORE TO DO. KNOW THAT I DO APPRECIATE- THE INDIVIDUALS ORGANIZATIONS AND THE GROUPS THAT ARE LEADING THIS EVERITT IN ORANGE COUNTY TO HOUSE THOSE THAT. ARE NOT HOUSED BUT ALSO TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS WE KNOW THAT PREVENTION IS ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS. IN REDUCING HOMELESSNESS SO WHETHER IT'S- PARISHES OR CHURCHES. OR INDIVIDUAL NON PROFITS THAT ARE ABLE TO HELP FAMILIES WITH RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO STAY IN APARTMENT VERSES BEING. EVICTED WHETHER IT'S- GRANTS AND FUNDS THAT PEOPLE ARE APPLYING FOR TO HELP IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES THAT'S ALL MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN ORANGE COUNTY. WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO NOW IS MOVE TO A MODEL THAT I HAVE BEEN OUT TO VISIT AS A NEW MODEL AND ORANGE COUNTY IT IS ACTUALLY CALLED BE WELL ORANGE COUNTY. THEY HAVE- IN A VERY EXCITING DAY FOR THEM- WILL BE WALL WELCOMING MR MARSHALL MONCRIEF WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WHEN A LET HIM OUTLINED NOT ONLY WHAT BE WELL DOES BUT I KNOW THAT. IN THE OTHER PART SOUTH COUNTY IRVINE I BELIEVE THEY ARE GOING TO BE. CELEBRATING STATE FUNDS THAT HAVE COME IN TO BUILD A SECOND MODEL OF BE WELL BUT FOR TODAY LET'S WELCOME MR MARSHALL MONCRIEF. HI ASSEMBLY WOMAN KIRK SILVA- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WANT TO ECHO THE FIRST PANEL- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ACROSS THESE TOPICS. AND PARTICULARLY THIS THIS TOPIC- FOR THIS OUR SECOND PANEL ON INTEGRATED COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS- IT REALLY STRIKES AT THE CORE OF WHAT BE WELL ORANGE COUNTY IS ABOUT AND IN FACT I GOT- SUCH A KICK AND A BIG SMILE OUT OF SEEING ALL THE PEOPLE. ARE LISTED- ACROSS THE PANELS TODAY BECAUSE ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN A PART OF THAT ARE PART OF THE LEADERS IN BE WELL ORANGE COUNTY AND SO MANY OF THEM COULD SPEAK ON THE TOPIC OF BE WELL- JUST LIKE I COULD STILL- HONORED TO TAKE A MINUTE- TO TALK ABOUT IT. AND THEN I WANT TO SHIFT GEARS AND TALK ABOUT- THE TOPIC AT HAND WHICH IS INTEGRATEDCOMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AS IT APPLIES TO MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESSNESS SPECIFICALLY AND I'D LIKE TO ECHO A COUPLE OF THINGS. THAT MISTER HOLD SPEND A DOCTOR CHAO HIGHLIGHTED. AND THEN FOLLOW HEATHER'S LEAD IN IDENTIFYING A COUPLE OF NEEDS- IN THE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. SO JUST TO SET SOME CONTEXT- BE WELL ORANGE COUNTY- IS AN EFFORT LED BY EVERYBODY- HERE TODAY- TRYING TO BRING TOGETHER THE COMMUNITY INTO ONE UNIFIED EFFORT- IDENTIFYING THAT WE HAVE A LOT. OF REALLY GREAT SERVICES A LOT OF REALLY GREAT PROGRAMS IN ORANGE COUNTY BUT HISTORICALLY THEY HAVE OPERATED IN SILOS AND FRAGMENTATION IS AS BIG A CHALLENGE AS THE OLDEST SERVICE THEMSELVES. FRAGMENTATION OF OUR SYSTEM IS AS BIG A CHALLENGE AS THE OLDER SYSTEMS BUT NONE CELLS AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL BE WELL HAS. BEEN AIMING TO SOLVE FOR. SO YEARS A- OF US- ON THE MULTIPLE PANELS TODAY GOT TOGETHER TO SAY WE CAN DO BETTER IF WE DO THINGS TOGETHER AND WE ORGANIZED OURSELVES AROUND MULTIPLE RESULT AREAS. AND STREAMS OF ACTION AND LIKE YOU NOTED ASSEMBLY WOMAN- WE HAVE NOW OPENED OUR FIRST CAMPUS OF CARE- IN ORANGE COUNTY WHICH IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND. BY WAY OF COLLABORATION THROUGH THE ORANGE COUNTY HEALTH CARE AGENCY. ALABAMA AND MANY OF THE NONPROFIT HOSPITALS- ALL WHILE PARTICIPATING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BECAUSE THEY ALL CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN- THE CAMPUS IS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE IN A UNIQUE WAY THAT'S EXHAUSTING TO THEIR PAYER STATUS. AND FOCUSED MOSTLY ON THEIR CLINICAL LEAD. SO THE FIRST THREE PATIENTS THAT CAME THROUGH THE CAMPUS OF WHEN WE OPENED IN JANUARY. THE FIRST ONE WAS A HOMELESS GENTLEMAN UNFUNDED AND ANY ABBREVIATED AND WE WERE ABLE TO BRING HIM AND GET HIM STABILIZE CONNECTED TO CARE. AND AND RAP RAP A HUG OF SUPPORT AROUND. THE SECOND PATIENT. WAS A MEDICAID A YOUNG LADY- WHO WAS STRUGGLING WITH SUICIDAL IDEATION AND WAS IN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT NOT GETTING GOOD CARE WE WERE ABLE TO- MEDICALLY STABILIZE HER AND GET HER OVER TO THE CAMPUS IN UNDER THIRTY MINUTES. AND THERE WE WERE ABLE TO STABILIZE GET HER BACK HOME AND TO HELP PATIENTS PROGRAM AND COMMUNITY. AND THE THIRD PATIENT WAS- BUT COMMERCIALLY INSURED YOUNG MAN TWENTY TWO HAVING HIS FIRST PSYCHOTIC BREAK OVER AT ANOTHER EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT- BECAUSE WE HAD ALREADY TRAINED THAT E. R. WE WERE ABLE TO MEDICALLY CLEAR HIM. VERY QUICKLY GET OVER TO THE CAMPUS AND HIS FIRST WORDS UPON ARRIVAL WORK WELL I THINK I COULD BREATHE. SO EVEN IN THE MIDST OF A FIRST PSYCHIATRIC BREAK NEW THE DIFFERENCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT HE WAS IN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. VERSUS THE ENVIRONMENT OF THIS- HIGH QUALITY CLINICAL CARE FACILITY AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET HIM INTO THE CARE NEEDED. THE REASON I HIGHLIGHT THOSE THOSE THREE PATIENTS- IS BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO WHAT'S POSSIBLE WITH COLLABORATION. SO ONE OF THE HOSPITALS WOULD HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME TREATING ALL THREE OF THOSE PEOPLE ACROSS ALL THREE OF THOSE DIFFERENT HAIR TYPES. ALL THREE OF THOSE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS SITUATIONS AND ALL THREE OF THOSE CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS. BUT BECAUSE THE COUNTY ALABAMA THE HOSPITAL'S ALL DID THIS TOGETHER WE WERE ABLE TO CARE FOR ALL THREE OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE SAME PLACE NO QUESTIONS ASKED BRING THEM IN AND WRAPPED A HOPELESS SUPPORT AROUND. SO TO ME THAT START SPEAKING TO THE TOPIC THAT YOU'VE LAID OUT FOR US TODAY. OF THE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. AND AND THE NECESSITY OF BRINGING COMMUNITY AND A COMMUNITY OF CARE PROVIDERS BETTER TOGETHER TO CREATE SYSTEMS OF CARE THAT ARE MORE INTEGRATED AND HOLISTIC. AND I REALLY LIKED- MR HOLTZMAN'S COMMENTS ON THAT HOLISTIC INTEGRATED CONTINUUM'S. OF CARE AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. ALL RIGHT A HIGHLIGHT A LITTLE- PIECE AT. IN OUR SYSTEM NOW AND THAT IS WE HAVE FRAGMENTATION WITHIN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM ITSELF. WE HAVE FRAGMENTATION WITHIN THE HOMELESS SERVICES SOLUTION ITSELF. AND BURN REGRETTABLY OFTENTIMES THE TUESDAY BROWN'S- POOR ATTEMPTS AT SYSTEMS ARE NOT INTEGRATED NEARLY ENOUGH- THE FUNDING STREAMS OFTENTIMES KEEP SEPARATE EFFORTS FUNDING STREAMS OFTENTIMES CREATE COMPETITION AND FRAGMENTATION OF INSTEAD OF COLLABORATION AND CONNECTIVITY AND SO THERE'S SOME REAL OPPORTUNITY THERE- IN THE LAST- IN THE LAST PLANE PLANE CAL- OR AT LEAST FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN POINT IN TIME COUNT I THAT I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME- WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ENTERED HOMELESSNESS- AT THAT POINT IN TIME COUNT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. IT WAS UP ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE ENTERED INTO HOMELESSNESS. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT WHO EXITED HOMELESSNESS INTO- GOING BACK HOME OR INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT WAS AROUND ROUGHLY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED. SO MUCH MORE GOING INTO HOMELESSNESS THEN WE HAD GOING OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. AND THE OTHER THING I THINK TO NOTE IS THAT AMONG THOSE GOING INTO HOMELESSNESS ONLY 40% IDENTIFIED ECONOMIC REASONS. SO IF WE HAVE 60% OF THE DRIVERS AND THE HOMELESSNESS IS MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE GOING INTO HOMELESSNESS FAR OUTSTRIPPING THE NUMBER THAT ARE EXITING HOMELESSNESS AND WE'VE GOT SOME REAL NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO BETTER WEAVE TOGETHER THE SYSTEM OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND THE SYSTEM OF HOMELESS SERVICE SOLUTIONS AND WE'RE GONNA NEED A WHOLE COMMUNITY EFFORT TO PULL THAT OFF- OBVIOUSLY. NOT EVERYBODY THAT IS HOMELESS IS MENTALLY ILL AND NOT EVERYBODY WAS MENTALLY ILL IS OMELESS- BUT THE NUMBERS ARE- ARE STRONG ENOUGH SUCH THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT OVERLAP. BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET REAL INTENTIONAL ABOUT BRINGING THESE SYSTEMS TOGETHER. SO A COUPLE OF- OF SORT OF SPECIFIC NEEDS I THINK- AGAIN FOLLOWING HEATHER'S LEAD I THINK WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES WHEN IT COMES TO LOOKING AT THAT STATE FUNDING. OF THAT OFTENTIMES RUNS THROUGH A COUNTY CHANNEL WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THAT FUNDING- TO INCENTIVIZE COLLABORATION AND CONNECTIVITY AND INTEGRATION. BECAUSE INADVERTENTLY SOMETIMES THOSE FUNDING STREAMS DR COMPETITION AND FRAGMENTATION- AMONGST A GROUP OF CARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE LARGELY- BY DNA DESIGN LOOKING FOR COLLABORATION AND CONNECTIVITY- BUT OFTENTIMES FUNDING STREAMS BECAUSE COMPETITION AND THAT SEPARATION. SO I WOULD CALL THAT OUT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US IN CALIFORNIA AND IN ORANGE COUNTY TO LOOK AT OUR FUNDING STREAMS AS OPPORTUNITIES. TO LEVERAGE- AND INCENTIVIZE PARTNERSHIP AND INTEGRATION. OF THE OTHER THING I JUST THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION OF THAT DOCTOR CHAO WAS COMMENTING ON IS- THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE ILLNESSES THEMSELVES. AND SO WE JUST TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SYSTEM AND THE FRAGMENTATION THERE HOW WE MIGHT ADDRESS SOME THINGS TO BRING INTEGRATION BUT THEN THERE'S THE CHALLENGES OF THE ILLNESSES THEMSELVES. AND AND THERE IS A STRANGE QUALITY TO THE ILLNESSES OF SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL- MENTAL ILLNESSES WHERE IN THE PERSON SUFFERING OFTENTIMES IS THE LAST IN LINE TO REALIZE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY'RE STRUGGLING AND SUFFERING AND OFTENTIMES IT'S THE ILLNESS ITSELF. THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM ENGAGING IN CARE ALL THE DIFFERENT THAN OTHER MEDICAL ILLNESSES SOMEBODY A GETS A CANCER DIAGNOSIS TODAY THERE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE SAYING YES PLEASE SIGN ME UP GET ME INTO THE BEST CARE PROVIDER POSSIBLE- THE PERSON STRUGGLING WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA OR A SEVERE ADDICTION. OFTENTIMES IT TAKES MANY MANY MANY TIMES OF ENGAGEMENT TO GET THEM TO SEE THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR ILLNESS AND AGREED TO CARE. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSCORE SOMETHING DOCTOR CHANNEL MENTIONED WITH REGARDS TO- POLICY CHANGE IN REGULATION CHANGE IN IT VIRTUALLY SOME OF THE POLICIES IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT PEOPLES- INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WHICH IS CLEARLY A VERY IMPORTANT THING. CAN ALSO INADVERTENTLY INTERFERE WITH A COMMUNITY OF CARE PROVIDERS BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT'S CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE FOR A PERSON IN NEED- OF A STORY THAT- THAT THAT STRUCK ME ECENTLY AND I- HERE THESE STORIES ALL THE TIME- EVERYDAY OF MY LIFE IN FACT- A FAMILY MEMBER CALLED ME A FEW WEEKS AGO. BECAUSE THERE- A TEENAGER WAS- PSYCHOTIC IN THE PARK- pHAD BEEN LIVING IN THE BUSHES IN THE PARK- FOR MANY DAYS- THE CARE PROVIDER TEAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY. WENT OUT AND WENT AND GAVE EACH THE YOUNG MAN- HE WAS A TO PULL THE ENOUGH TO SAY OH NO I'M GONNA GO GET A SANDWICH AND THAT'S WHERE I'M GONNA SHOWER UP AND- HE WAS ABLE TO HOLD IT TOGETHER FOR THE SIXTY SECOND. NINETY SECOND INTERACTION- SUFFICIENT TO SAY THERE'S NO CRITERIA TO INTERVENE ON THIS PERSON AGAINST THEIR WILL- THE YOUNG MAN DIED- NOT LONG AFTER THAT- TO SUICIDE. SO I THINK THERE IS- SOMETHING HERE ON THE POLICY SIDE WITH THE ILLNESSES THEMSELVES. THAT- PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY- FOR US TO INTERVENE BETTER AND- AND ADDRESS SOME OF THESE FOLKS- WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS- WE NOW KNOW 60% OF THEM OUT THERE AT LEAST AT THE TWENTY NINETEEN POINT TIME COUNT. ARE THERE DRIVEN BY SUBSTANCE USE. AND MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. SO I'LL STOP THERE- AGAIN MUCH APPRECIATION FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE ASSEMBLYWOMAN QUIRK SILVA AND- WE ARE OUR BROTHERS SISTERS IN ARMS HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW YOUR PERSONAL PASSION WE SHARE IT WITH YOU. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU MR MARSHALL- MONCRIEF- FOR THAT VERY- EXTENSIVE REMARKS ABOUT NOT ONLY WHAT YOU SEE THAT WE'RE DOING WELL BUT ALSO. AS YOU SAID FRAGMENTATION IN THE SYSTEM I TOO HAVE SEEN THAT NOT ONLY FIRSTHAND BUT ALSO AS SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS AN AREA ALL TOO OFTEN BECAUSE OF THE SILOS AND BY THE WAY I WILL REMARK THAT THERE IS MUCH WORK. GOING ON YOU YOU N. B. WELL AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE WHICH IS AN EXTENSIVE GROUP I BELIEVE AT ONE POINT YOU HAD TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE ON YOUR- KIND OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE- VERY. IS THAT CORRECT OR WELL YEAH THERE'S- ABOUT THREE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THAT ARE NOW ACTIVELY INVOLVED AND BE WELL ORANGE COUNTY AT OVER SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS OUT OF TOUCH INTO IT VARIOUS POINTS. AND SO- WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WE HAVE A LOT OF POTHOLES WE'RE GOING TO STEP IN- BUT IT IS SUCCEEDING IN CREATING A SPACE WHERE EVERYBODY CAN COME TOGETHER AND LANDED THEIR PARTICULAR SKILLS AND TALENTS AND RESOURCES. IN THE SAME SWIM LANE AND AGAIN I WANT TO CALL OUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON YOUR PANELS TODAY OUR LEADERS WITHIN THAT SPACE AND SO THEY COULD SPEAK TO THIS AS MUCH AS ME- AND- AND SO WE THINK ORANGE COUNTY. IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THE STATE AND- AND WE HAVE A LOT OF LEADERSHIP REPRESENTED HERE TODAY WHO ARE INNOVATIVE. AND THEIR COURAGEOUS AND READY TO MAKE THE CHANGES NEEDED. TO UNIFY A SYSTEM AND DO SOMETHING TRANSFORMATIONAL ORANGE COUNTY AND FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THANK YOU ANYONE INDEED YOU HAVE BY OPENING UP THE FIRST OF BE WELL THE ORANGE COUNTY BUT ALSO. TO NOTE IT IS A PART OF THE PUZZLE WE NEED ADDITIONAL. B. WELLS I KNOW IN THE CASE. WE WOULD HAVE FOR OF THEM THAT WOULD TOUCH NOT ONLY- CENTRAL SOUTH NORTH ORANGE COUNTY- THAT BEING SAID EVERY STEP FORWARD IS A STEP TO CELEBRATE. ONE OF THE THINGS THOUGH I'VE WORKED ON AS THE STATE AS FAR AS POLICY HAS BEEN. WHAT YOU AND OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED WHERE IS IF IN INDIVIDUAL TRIES TO ATTAIN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND YET THEY HAVE AN ADDICTION- THE LAW WAS UNCLEAR OF CAN. MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS BE USED FOR CO OCCURRING CONDITIONS AND IN FACT MY BILL LAST YEAR THAT WAS SIGNED CLARIFIED. THAT YES IF SOMEBODY'S EXPERIENCING NOT ONLY ADDICTION BUT MENTAL HEALTH THEY CAN BE TREATED I AND BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN POINTS WHERE IF YOU'RE HAVE AN ADDICTION NO YOU NEED TO COME TO US BUT IF YOU HAVE MENTAL HEALTH YOU NEED TO GO OVER THERE. AND THAT IS AN EXTREMELY A DIFFICULT A SCENARIO FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND THEN IF YOU ADD ON TO THAT SOMETIMES ANOTHER OCCURRING A CONDITION WHICH COULD BE A PHYSICAL CONDITION SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THREE OCCURRING CONDITIONS AT THE SAME TIME. AND THEN ADD EVEN MORE TO THAT WITH WHICH MA BE VERY LITTLE RESOURCES TO GET AROUND THE COUNTY FROM TRANSPORTATION- TO VERY LITTLE RESOURCES FROM ACTUALLY HAVING- DOLLARS IN THEIR POCKET POCKET TO HOP ON A BUS TO GET A NEW WORD TO GET TO THESE APPOINTMENTS. SO WHEN WEEKEND HOUSE SOME OF THESE SERVICES UNDER ONE UMBRELLA IN ONE BUILDING EVEN MAKE THESE APPOINTMENTS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER BUT NOW EVEN WITH IF ANYTHING IS A SILVER LINING IS A THROUGH THE PANDEMIC IS THESE VIRTUAL OPPORTUNITIES HAVING PEOPLE POSSIBLY BEING ABLE TO ATTEND- THERAPY. OR A SESSION THAT COULD HELP A VIRTUALLY ACT- WHETHER IT'S EVEN THE HOUSING PLACE THAT THEY'RE AT SO THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY YEP TO APPOINTMENT TO APPOINTMENT AND FOR SOME OF THEM THE TOLERANCE IS VERY LITTLE AND WE LOSE THEM IN THAT SYSTEM- SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD. TO SEEING THAT AND AGAIN WHEN I SEE THESE INTEGRATED INTEGRATED SYSTEMS OF CARE I KNOW THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK- THANK YOU MISTER MARSHALL. MONCRIEFF AND- GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. AND WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND OUT NOW INTRODUCE- MISTER PAUL LEóN I AND- MISTER PAUL LEóN I WAS ACTUALLY SOMEBODY. THAT WORKED FOR THE COUNTY NOW IS WORKING WITH HIS OWN FOUNDATION. I AND HE HAS. I THINK TOUCH MANY MANY INDIVIDUALS WITH THE TYPE OF CARE HE IS PROVIDING MISTER PAUL LEóN IS THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF ILLUMINATION FOUNDATION WHICH BY THE WAY THE CITY OF FULLER TEN HOST. WHICH WE CALL ON A I WILL LET HIM DESCRIBE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN FULLERTON WELCOME MR LEON. RIGHT GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S KIRK SILVA AND- THE SELECTED A AND ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES YOURSELF THANKFUL THAT- WERE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE TODAY WITH THE AIRLINE- I'M ACTUALLY IN ORDER CAN ACT THE RECUPERATIVE NAVIGATION CENTER BACK- ASSEMBLY WHAT MAKING IT WORSE SO INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING ME PUSH FORWARD- PLEASE IT IS ONE OF THE MODELS ALONG WITH THE WELL. THAT WE REALLY. NEED AND NEED IT FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THAT DOCTOR CHILD MYSELF MATT- MANY OF US TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS AND THAT IS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM UP HEALTHCARE HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH DENTAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE ALL UNDER ONE UMBRELLA- IT'S THAT WE OPEN UP ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. AND IT WORKED FAR BETTER THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED- AND I DON'T KNOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS A LITTLE BIT BY. HOW THE COMMUNITY FEELS ABOUT HAVING A CENTER WITH IN THE END THERE COMMUNITY AND YOU ALLUDED TO THAT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEM HAVING RESERVATIONS- MENTAL HEALTH HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING CELLS TO BE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS COMING INTO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. I CAN'T TELL YOU HAD COLOR TEN WERE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM A PRESCHOOL DOWN THE STREET FROM A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND A RESIDENTIAL AREA BEHIND US AND WE'VE BEEN HERE A YEAR AND A HALF AND WE HAD ZERO COMPLAINTS WE'VE ACTUALLY INTEGRATED WITH COMMUNITY AND OUR HELP IN THAT. SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY- WE ARE MODEL TO BETTER BACK NEXT WEEK WE HAVE A CONTINGENCY FIRM IN NEW YORK STATE THAT'S GONNA FLY OUT AND TAKE A TOUR TWO DAYS OUT NOT ONLY DID THEY ASK BUT- HOPEFULLY BE WHILE. AND SOME OF THE MY- EXAMINER TALK. AND DURING KOBE THERE. OF THEM OUT THAT'S HOW WE IMPORT. WHILE WORKING AND CATCH WHAT MODELS COULD DO. A TO SERVE OUR MOST. BUT WHAT I LIKE TO STRETCH WITH YOU IS JUST. WORKING PIECE OF WHAT WE DO AND THAT'S THAT THAT WE WORK WITH- YOU KNOW WE CHECK ACROSS THAT OF TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY AND- THAT CAME THROUGH ARCUS. AND WORK PREDICT- THE FEW YEARS. AND ONE THING WE- RIGHT AWAY. THAT FIFTY EIGHT OF THEM WERE SPM ICE SEVERE PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS- NOW IT THEY SHOULD BE AT A FULL SERVICE PROGRAM BUT AS YOU KNOW THE SERVICES AND PROVIDERS ARE SO LIMITED. THAT THEY DID HAVE TURKEY AND RECUPERATIVE CARE AND WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF AND STILL ARE TAKING CARE OF A- YOU'LL SEE THAT WITH THIS NEXT SLIDE. THAT 81% OF THE TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX HAVE A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS AND HAVE A SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ARE- SP AND LYFT DIAGNOSIS SO I BELIEVE- BACKSTROKE ABOUT THE CO OCCURRING. DISORDERS AND- YOU- HI THE FACT THAT NOT ALL WEEK WITH PEOPLE WITH SO ABUSE. MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER. BUT MEDICAL DISORDERS THAT'S WHY THE FACILITY THAT WERE IN IS SO CRUCIAL BECAUSE WE CAN'T HANDLE MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE IF SUPPORTERS ALL RIGHT NOT. ALL IN THE SAME PROGRAM THIS IS JUST A SLIDE THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT THE REST- FORTIES INDIVIDUALS YOU SEE THAT ZERO HI IT'S COOPERATION. ARE MENTAL HEALTH AT SCHIZOPHRENIA THERE THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE ARTS ON REGULAR BASIS. IT'S INSTRUMENTAL WE CAPTURE NOT ONLY THIS DATA BUT COST WISE- JUST TO CHERYL HOW EFFECTIVE THIS PROGRAM IS THE ONLY AND IN TREATING THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT. ALSO THAT WE ARE. J. TAXPAYERS AND IF WE THE MONEY APPROACH LIFE HAVE THERE ANALYTICS. WE COULD DO THAT SO WE KNOW HOW TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE SAYS THAT HIT THAT WATER REPORT HEY. SO AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BREAKDOWN I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE REALIZE THAT LOOK AT THE AGE GROUP WITH THE S. THEY MADE LAST WEEK TAKE CARE THERE IS A SIXTY FIVE OUR PASSAGE GROWING POPULATION OF HOMELESS OR SENIOR WOMEN AS A MATTER OF FACT SOME OF OUR FACILITIES THAT WE WANTED ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE LESS EIGHTY YEARS ALL WE HAVE TO MAKE IT EASIER EIGHTY FIVE YEARS ALL. THAT LIVED IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT WORKED THE WHOLE TIME I HUSBANDS AND NALCOR DEPENDENT ON US TO TAKE CARE OF IN A SHELTER. WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. THAT'S THE NEXT. CARESSES COMMUNITY- AGAIN I REMEMBER TALKED ABOUT FAUCETS EXPENSE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH LICENSE STAFF THAT ARE NURSES LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS DOCTORS- BUT THIS GRANT WILL SHOW YOU. A NEED FOR CREDIT INTO THAT PROGRAM THAT WHILE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE WE CHECK CHARACTER THE COST WAS TWENTY FIVE. MILLION SIX HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND RODWAY OF COURSE WHEN THEY'RE IN OUR PROGRAM GATE WENT DOWN CONSIDERABLY BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT NUMBER TO LOOK AT HERE IS A LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY WENT BACK IN A PERMANENT CAL. THAT COSTS WOULD STILL LOWER AND IT AND APOSS STAVING SUCH SEVENTEEN MILLION WHICH JUST SO IT'S TWELVE HUNDRED THE INDIVIDUALS SO WE HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT IT IS COST EFFECTIVE AND IT IS BETTER FOR THE CLIENTS THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE ALL THOSE- REMEMBER ALTHOUGH SERVICES. IN ONE PROGRAM- EXPECT STAY WE'VE BEEN THIS FOR TWO YEARS. AND ALLOW WITH MANY OTHER AND COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT- THAT MARSHALL TALKED- THAT CONTINUE OF CARE THAT BRIDGES TO MAKE CLOSER. ONE AT THAT YOU KNOW THE BIG. ITEMS AN ORANGE COUNTY LA THROUGHOUT THE NATION'S HOUSING. HOUSING THAT'S HEALTH CARE AND JUST RECENTLY WHERE- MANY AT THAT WELL I SEATS ARE COMING DOWN THEY ARE BEGINNING TO SEE ON THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY IS BEGINNING TO SEE THAT HOUSING IS HEALTHCARE. IF YOU CAN'T TELL SOMEBODY- SUFFICIENT WAY THAT THEY CAN'T ACCESS HEALTH CARE SO THAT'S A HUGE COMPONENT THAT WE'RE INVOLVED WITH AGAIN MANY OTHERS AN ORANGE COUNTY TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT HOUSING IS HEALTHCARE AND IT'S ESSENTIAL. FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD. I ONE OF THE THAT THAT WE EMPLOY EARLY ON- WITH MANY OTHERS IS TO HOME BEING A TO TEXT. WITH OUT REACH AGAIN OF OUR CITY- BUT- FROM THE COW. ARE WORKING AND HOW REACH. THAT GRAHAM US SHELTERS LIKE BASS AND WE CAN MOVE THROUGH THE COMMUNITY. IT'S THIS. ONE OF THE BIGELOW EXCITING THINGS COMING I NOW COMING SACRAMENTO IT'S KELLY WORKING WHERE. ALOT DIMANA THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING IT LITERACY SERVICES ADD IT IS SO ESSENTIAL THAT- THESE FOUR COMPONENTS THAT MANY OF US ARE WORKING WELL. THAT THEIR IMPLEMENTED SO THAT WE CAN AGAIN TAKE THAT MONEY THAT'S COMING DOWN I CAN'T STAND IT APPEARS THAT WAY WISELY AND TARGET TO PEOPLE THAT NEED OUR HELP THE MOST SO. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR AND THEIR SHARE AND STE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO- THIS NEXT YEAR BUT OUT OF HOGAN AND WORKING MORE WITH- MY COLLEAGUES AND I DON'T HAVE BIG BOTTLES AT YOU AND THAT COULD MAKE A HAVE SUPPORT AND- I IN THE PAST SO THAT WE GET. RELATE I PUT IT DOWN AND ANALYSTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LEóN- SO WHO I'VE NOT. THE NEW THAT IS A IT IS LEGACY TO. DO WELL WE NEED TO DO TO GET PEOPLE THIS AND- I THIS IMMENSELY I WILL GO AHEAD AND RE QUOTE WHAT YOU JUST SAID HOUSING IS HEALTH CARE AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THAT TERM BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE LAST TIME I USE THAT TERM. BECAUSE LAST WEEK I SPENT QUITE A BIT WITH OUR CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION GOING TO SAINT JUDE PROVIDENCE NOW ON FULLER TEN TALKING TO SOME OF. THE PROVIDERS AND AS WE KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT WITH NOT ONLY COVERT BUT WITH THIS POPULATION WHETHER IT'S MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ADDICTION NEEDS. THEM NOW SUPPORTING B. WELL BUT PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE SUPPORTING HOUSING THIS THIS MAKES SENSE WE WANT PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE AN EMERGENCY ROOMS AND IN THE HOSPITAL TO BE THERE BUT PEOPLE WHO CAN BE TREATED. IN OTHER TYPES OF MODELS AND THEN EVENTUALLY GET THEM HELLO STE SO THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING AN ISSUE SAID- THE SERVICE PERSON A PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS AND WE KNOW THAT WITH SOME OF OUR DATA TRACKING SYSTEMS SOMETIMES IT'S THE TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY PEOPLE. THAT ARE ARE RETURNING TO THESE EMERGENCY ROOMS THREE FOUR FIVE TIMES A WEEK AND THIS IS EXTREMELY COSTLY I AND- WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REALLY SOLVE THIS UNLESS WE START WITH THAT ST TO HOME MODEL THAT YOU MENTIONED SO REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND- AS. YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS IN COMMUNICATION. THANK YOU MR POLLY ON. YEAH NEXT TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS MOVED FROM ORANGE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH A SPENDING MANY MANY IF NOT ALL OF HIS PROFESSIONAL YEARS WORKING FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE TO NOW BEING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF CAL OPTIMA MISTER RICK RICHARD SANCHEZ HE HAS A WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE AND A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE.

ORANGE COUNTY- WE'RE A LARGE PROVIDER THAT AGAIN HOW MANY. EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND NO NO THAT THAT'S APPOINTED TIME THAT NUMBER DOES CHANGE BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH- IT'S HARD WE'VE BEEN IN RECENT I THINK THAT WE CAN EXPECT THAT THAT NUMBER TO GROW- IT AND THEN YOU KNOW IF EVERY WOMAN.

EXCELLENT PLACE TO TAKE YOUR EXPERTISE FROM THE COUNTY TO CAL OPTIMA. BUT SOME OF THE BUT TAKE AWAYS ARE WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THERE ARE POPULATIONS WHEN PEOPLE USE THE WORD VULNERABLE SOMETIMES IT'S GETS PEOPLE. NERVOUS BECAUSE THEY THINK OKAY WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY BUT THE TRUTH IS- IT'S- INDIVIDUALS EXITING THE FOSTER SYSTEM WE KNOW THEY'RE VERY PRONE TO FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. IF THEY'RE NOT HEADED TO COLLEGE AND WE KNOW MANY OF THEM AREN'T WE KNOW THAT AS OUR POPULATION AGES AND THERE ISN'T A SAFETY NET. AS WAS NOTED MANY WOMEN SENIOR WOMEN IN THEIR FIFTIES SIXTIES SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. ARE FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO KNOW THAT FORMALLY INCARCERATED. WHETHER THEY'RE RELEASED. IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND THIS IS THE BIG MESS THAT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS ARE COMING FROM LOS ANGELES OR OTHER NO ORANGE COUNTY HAS THEIR OWN HOMELESS AND WE EACH HAVE HOMELESS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF OUR OWN. CITIES AND INTEL WE ADDRESS THIS MYTH THAT THESE ARE NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WATCH THIS POPULATION GROW- BUT AGAIN RIEN.

THE SERVICE AND THE HELP AND THE CONNECTION- THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR OUR LAST SPEAKER ON OUR SECOND PANEL MISTER RICHARD SANCHEZ SO WE ARE GOING TO HEAD INTO OUR LAST PANEL A AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PRESENTERS BEFORE THE SIX. EXCELLENT EXPERTS AND- THAT A MOVE FORWARD TO OUR LAST PANEL WHERE WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS HOUSING AND IMPORTANT OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES WILL MAKE SOME GENERAL NOTES- SOMEWHERE ON THE POINT OF TIME COUNT AND AGAIN I MAY BE VERY WRONG ON THIS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT ORANGE COUNTY AT ANY EVENING HAS BETWEEN SEVEN THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE KNOW THAT ARE THAT ARE NUMBER REPRESENTS PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS BUT IT DOES NOT REPRESENT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE POSSIBLY LEVINE- WITH FAMILY MEMBERS ARE VERY CLOSE TO EVICTION AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE- PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN THEIR CARS ARE ARE VIS. WHICH HAS PRESENTED ITSELF TO BE YET I KNOW ANOTHER SCENARIO UNDER HOUSING THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH AN ORANGE COUNTY. SO WITH THAT WE WILL PRESENT OUR THREE SPEAKERS- I WANT TO- MAKE NOTE HERE- THIS IS THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF STAUNTON THE HONORABLE DAVID SHAWVER WHO I'VE WORKED WITH NOW ALMOST TO GET DECADE SINCE MY CITY COUNCIL DAYS. WHERE WE SERVED ON THE SANITATION BOARD TOGETHER AND. THIS MAYOR THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS THE ONLY. MAYOR AND CITY AND ORANGE COUNTY TO APPLY FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY HOME KEY FUNDS WHICH BY THE WAY THEY APPLIED FOR TO- HOME KEY PROJECTS AND RECEIVED TWO. I REALLY APPLAUD HIS LEADERSHIP WE HAVE THIRTY SIX CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY THIRTY SIX WE GOT TWO AWARDS TWO OUT OF TWO. AND EVEN IF WE HAD 50% OF OUR CITIES- THAT APPLIED FOR EVEN ONE SMALL HOTEL THAT MAY BE HAD BETWEEN TWENTY TO THIRTY UNITS PLEASE DO THE MATH HOW MANY UNITS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WOULD WE HAVE. IF WE HAD SAY FIFTEEN CITIES THAT APPLIED AND WERE REWARDED FOR EVEN TWENTY TO THIRTY UNITS THAT'S THE WAY WE START TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IT BY EACH CITY LOOKING AT ONE SPOT WHERE THEY CAN DO SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY. DONE YES THERE WILL BE NEIGHBORS WHO DON'T WANT IT YES YOU WILL HAVE COUNCILS WHERE PEOPLE WILL COME AND SAY NOT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING HIS BOLD WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING TO HELP PEOPLE YOU START TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION SO WELCOME TO OUR HONORABLE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF STAUNTON DAVID SHAWVER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYWOMAN SHARON QUIRK SILVA I ADMIRE A LOT OKAY WITH PAUL YES I SEE YOU YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD YOU'RE MAYOR. OKAY YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE OLDER. ANYWAY GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER SHARON QUIRK SILVA FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE. ON ORANGE COUNTY HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY REPRESENTING MY COMMUNITY OUR CITY COUNCIL AND STAFF. AND I'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE HOUSING PROGRAMS THAT ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL IT'S DAY AFTER. ARE NOW BEING SUPPORTED BY A VARIETY OF STATE HOUSING PROGRAMS IN COOPERATION WITH THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. THIS UNIQUE SYMBIOSIS THERE'S A REASON FOR OUR SUCCESS. IT ALL STARTED TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN POLYGONUM GIG TO BE LOOKING FOR SUPPORT OF HIS VISION TO PROVIDE SHELTER AND SERVICES FOR HOMELESS POPULATIONS. ALWAYS FRUSTRATED YOU HAVE BEEN TURNED DOWN BY EVERY CITY IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT IT REACHED OUT TO HIM. I IMMEDIATELY WALKED PENSION STATEN AND THE REST IS A HISTORY OF THE ILLUMINATION FOUNDATION AND THE IMPACT IT IS MADE EVERYWHERE. STANTON HAS CONTINUED AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS READ THE ELIMINATION FOUNDATION AID THE HOMELESS POPULATION OF ORANGE COUNTY PROVIDING THEM WITH THE NEEDED SERVICES AND SHELTER. HEGEMONY GONE WITH THE FOUNDATION DR ROBERT HOUSE WAS% THE FIRST HOUSING PROJECT INSTANTON. WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO GET MOTEL KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES OFF THE STREETS. AND THAT TO A LARGE ALL OFFER MULTIPLE FAMILIES WITH SCHOOL AGED KIDS. IT WAS BILL WITH CHERNOBYL GROUPS ASSISTED BY OUR STATE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. IT WAS UP AND RUNNING IN TIME TO GET THE KIDS. OUT SO THEY DIDN'T MISS ANY SCHOOL. TO QUALIFY FOR THIS EMERGENCY HOUSING HAPPEN THROUGHOUT A FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY HOMELESS BUT ALSO HAD TO HAVE A CHILD IN THEIR CUSTODY ARE PREGNANT MOM AT THE POINT OF RETURN. NEXT DETERMINED TO HELP THE COUNTY OF ORANGE THE COMMUNITY OF STANTON AND ARE CITY COUNCIL VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE. IN OUR CITY. OUR I'M SORRY TO PARTICIPATE IN PROJECT ROOKIE WHICH CONVERTED STANTON AND ENJOY A HOMELESS FACILITY THAT PROTECTED ELDERLY AND DISABLED HOMELESS THERE WERE VERBAL TO THE CORONA VIRUS. MONDAY FOR PROJECT GROUP HE WAS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND THE CITY OF STAUNTON. A JOINT EFFORT BY THE ELIMINATION FOUNDATION AND CITY. MADE IT A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH. GROUP T. RESIDENTS AND THE RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES OF OUR COMMUNITY. WE'RE BEING FORWARD THE CITY'S THERE COULD TRIP TO COST AND ACQUISITION F. PROGRAMS TOGETHER WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AS WITH IMPORTANT TO CONVERT NOT ONLY THE STATE MINIMUM IS PART OF THE NEW HOME KING SUPPORTED. HOUSING STATE WATER PROJECT WE INCLUDED THE G. HEATING LOCALE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS NEEDED IN ORANGE COUNTY. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS MOMENT TO PERSONALLY THANK THE AMERICAN FAMILY HOUSING AND JAMBOREE HOUSING FOR MAKING OUR WHOLE G. PROJECT AMONG THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SUPPORTING. HOUSING IN ORANGE COUNTY. DID WE'RE WE'RE JUST YOU HERE FUNDING TO COME OUR THIRD SO HOUSING PRICE AT THE RIVIERA. WE HAVE MOST OF THE NEEDED FUNDS ARE SEEKING TO FINISH THE PROJECT. HE ALSO OWNS THE PARCEL BETWEEN THE DVD EVERY. IT WILL BE DONATED TO BUILD A FACILITY THAT WOULD PROVIDE SERVICE FOR THESE FOR BOTH OF THESE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS THE CENTER WILL PROVIDE RECUMBENT CARE JOB TRAINING TO GET INDIVIDUALS BACK INTO A HEALTHY PRODUCTIVE LIFE. STANTON ALSO AT THIS PARK HAS THE MOST LOW. LOW AND MODERATE HOUSING PER CAPITAL IN CITY IN ORANGE COUNTY HOWEVER OUR NEXT MAJOR PROJECT IS TO BUILD ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THE AREA THAT IS WHY I AM TRYING TO READ FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS. THIS PROJECT WILL BE ADJACENT TO ONE HUNDRED AT MARKET RATE UNITS THAT WILL SHARE IDENTITIES. WITH RESIDENTS OF ALL TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE UNITS INCLUDING SECURITY FENCING AROUND THE ENTIRE HOUSING COMMITTEE. ALL TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE UNITS WHAT'S YOUR COMMON RECREATIONAL FACILITIES OPEN SPACE AT START PROGRAMS SWIMMING POOL. LARGE COMMUNITY BUILDINGS PER DAY CARE AND ACTIVITIES. ONE VERY POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IT THIS TIME O BE A DARK COMMITTEE MANAGER IS THAT WE NEED HELP WITH RELOCATION COSTS. TODAY THERE IS NO SPECIFIC FUNDING AVAILABLE THAN I WILL WEAR A ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HE'S RELOCATION COSTS SIMPLY DRAIN LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCES AND KEEP US FROM EXPANDING OUR PERMANENT HOUSING IT IS NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITY. IF THIS COMMITTEE COULD RECOMMEND TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HELP CITIES WITH RELOCATION COSTS IT WOULD MAKE IT MORE ATTAINABLE PRESS TO BUILD THE MUCH NEEDED PERMITTED HOUSING YEAH ORANGE COUNTY AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AFTER TO REPORT THAT I PUT THAT I PUT ON TODAY'S RECORD I'M SORRY I HAVE I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT ALL THAT I HAVE PUT ON TODAY'S RECORD. BEGAN ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY HOMELESS TRANSIENTS CAMPED. ARE ONLY THREE AND A HALF SQUARE MILE CITY OUR REGULAR TRACKS IN OUR PARKS RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD. SIDEWALKS IN COMMERCIAL PROPERTY. WE ACCEPTED THE- OF PROVIDE OUR PROGRAM HELP THE SAID. SO THE CITY DEVELOPED A STATE OF ART PROGRAM IT HAS BECOME A MODEL FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTY ORANGE WORKING WITH JUDGE CARTER. OUR LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY T. WERE ABLE TO COMPLETE AND RETURN RELOCATE THE ENTIRE HOMELESS POPULATION IN THREE MONTHS. TODAY WERE ABLE TO DISTINCT SINCE THEY ARE EFFORTS WITH TRANSIT POPULATION WHEN THEY'RE PUBLIC SAFETY DIRECTOR OUTRAGE TEAM WHICH IS JACK CRIST RECENTLY DIVORCED MEMBERS TO CONTINUE TO BE A MODEL FOR THE CITIES. OF ORANGE COUNTY. THIS MARLBORO GRAHAM. IS HAVING GIVING US THE ABILITY TO OUR GAP ON. FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES OF THE BOYS DISTANCE. WE'RE ALSO A PURCHASE IN THE NORTH'S FAULT WHICH RISEN CITIES AND WHY A PARKING FOLDER TO. WE ALSO USE OUR LOCAL MOTEL VOUCHERS SYSTEM THE SYSTEM WAS NEED SHELTER ARE. IT THE FUTURE. WHERE WERE WITH OUR NEW CITY JR COURT HUNDRED FIFTY THIS. THERE CAN BE BY THE- AIRPORT GEORGIA ORANGE COUNTY. I HOPE TO ESTABLISH IT IS ALL INCLUSIVE FACILITY. THAT WILL HOUSE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND PROVIDED MEDICAL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL REHABILITATION ALL IN ONE PLACE. FIRST OVER TO THE RIGHT THE ILLINOIS FOUNDATION INSTEAD APART. AND THIS CARE SPENCER IT WILL BE THE FUTURE OF ADDRESSING ALL THE STATE'S. THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES WILL AT LEAST HELP OUR WIND CHILL UP THE HOMELESS PROBLEMS IT CALIFORNIA. WE ARE MENTAL ILLNESS AND DRUG ADDICTION AND ALCOHOL. IS THE PROBLEM TRANSIT ELEMENT THAT IS DESTROYING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IT MUST BE INCARCERATED AND TREATED. IN ADDITION WE ARE PARTING WITH OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES JABBAR MOTEL SIX TO PROVIDE OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY ADDITIONAL SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS. WILL BE REQUESTING FUNDING IN. THE FUTURE WITH THIS ADAPTER. FINALLY SMALL CITY LIKE MY- SURROUNDING CITIES ORANGE OR TO SB NINE IF HAVE A LOT OF EIGHTY ENGINEER HE YEARS AND HE'S PAYER RESIDENTIAL. THEY WILL EVERYONE INCLUDING OVERCROWDING LACK OF PARKING IMPACT ON INFRASTRUCTURE ESPECIALLY IN MY SMALL COMMUNITY. BURKE GAS WATER AND ELECTRICITY. BY THE WAY IS PROBABLY NOT ONE THAT THE PURCHASES THESE PROPERTIES IS BEING GUIDED BY DEVELOPERS AND OTHER CONTRACTORS OR TURNING THEM INTO APARTMENT LIKE HOUSING WOULD YOU GIVE WILL IMPACT MY SMALL CITY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THAT YOU RE EVALUATE THE SIZE OF THE CITY RELATED TO THAT BILL. AT THIS TIME I'M OPERATE IN THE CITY IN ORANGE COUNTY IT WOULD LIKE TO HELP OUR INFORMATION ON. OUR PROGRAMS TO CONTACT ME OR MY STAFF AND I WILL MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR HOUSING AND HOMELESS PROGRAM THE- THANK YOU FOR HELPING US GET. OUR LOCAL CITIES AND FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE TODAY. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK ME. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERYONE TO MAKE ORANGE COUNTY A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MAYOR DAVID SHAWVER- FOR THOSE EXTENSIVE COMMENTS AND- YOU GOT EVERYTHING IN THERE SO WE APPRECIATE THAT AND WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP TO LOOK FOR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MAKING- DIFFERENCE IN ORANGE COUNTY NOT ONLY FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE BUT ALSO FOR ENTRY LEVEL HOUSING. WITH THAT I DO WANT TO ASK YOU ON YOUR TO PROJECTS THAT YOU WERE AWARDED IF YOU'RE STILL THERE. DID WE LOSE- YEAH HE'S STILL THERE IS. HOW MANY UNITS WERE EACH ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS FOR THE TO THE TWO CONVERSIONS. ARE WE WERE WE WERE CLOSE TO I THINK IT WAS SEVENTY FIVE ALMOST EIGHTY ACT OF THE STATE AND THEY HAVE. AND THE OTHER ONE WE HAVE FORTY SO I THINK THE TOTAL WASN'T I CORRECT ME WRONG FALLING BECAUSE ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY IS THAT CORRECT. OKAY SO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY UNITS. THAT'S JUST IN THE CITY OF STANTON AND I DID SAY IF WE WERE TO GET FIFTEEN. ORANGE COUNTY CITIES REMEMBER THIRTY SIX CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY TO DO A HOME CLEAN HOME KEY APPLICATION NOW AGAIN I WILL. NOTE THAT IS NOT AN EASY APPLICATION YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WILLING PROPERTY OWNERS BUT EVEN IF YOU WERE TO GET FIFTEEN CITIES TO DO TWENTY UNITS FOR A VERY SMALL A MOTEL HOTEL CONVERSION THAT'S THREE HUNDRED UNITS SCATTERED ACROSS ORANGE COUNTY. AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IS GOING TO BE THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IT ISN'T GOING TO BE ONE CITY DOING MANY MANY UNITS AND OTHER CITIES DOING. ZERO THE OTHER AREA THAT I WILL NOTE FROM YOUR COMMENTS. BECAUSE OF GEORGE DAVID CARTER BEING INVOLVED IN HOMELESSNESS IN ORANGE COUNTY AND NOW OTHER AREAS LOS ANGELES. THE CITY HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO OR THAT I SHOULD SAY THE COUNTY AND TO THREE SERVICE PROVIDER AREA SPOT AREAS NORTH ORANGE COUNTY WHICH STANTON IT INCLUDES ALSO INCLUDES I'M NOT GONNA LIST- BUT TEN CITIES OR TWELVE. HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO PUT- WHETHER IT'S THE HOME KEY PROJECTS IN STANTON WHETHER IT'S THE A HOMELESS SHELTER AND ONE OF PARK WHETHER IT'S ELIMINATION FOUNDATION RECUPERATIVE CENTER IN FULLERTON PLACENTIA WITH ANOTHER HOMELESS SHELTER AND VETERANS HOUSING ALL OF THESE MODELS AND FOR SOME OF THE SMALLER CITIES WHO AREN'T HOSTING SITES THEY ARE ACTUALLY PUTTING IN FUNDS. BUT I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT SAY THAT EVERY CITY NEEDS TO BE DOING SOMETHING GIVING DOLLARS TO US PAUL AREA IS GREAT BUT THE CITIES THAT ARE HOSTING THOSE AREAS. IT IS A DRAIN ON THEIR SERVICES AS YOU WELL KNOW MAYOR SHAWVER WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING INTO YOUR CITY FOR CITY OF FOR SERVICES WHETHER THE WRAPAROUND RECUPERATIVE- THIS TAKES UP QUITE A BIT OF POLICE TIME IT TAKES QUITE A BIT OF TIME FROM PARKS AND RECREATION FROM THE LOCAL CITIES THAT ARE HOSTING THEM. AND SO THIS WOULD BE MY PLEA I KNOW IT IS NOT POPULAR BELIEVE ME I KNOW WHAT IS NOT POPULAR BUT EVERY CITY NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING EVERY CITY NEEDS TO BE HOSTING SOMETHING UP AND AGAIN IF WE ALL DID SOMETHING IN IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE POPULATION SIZE OF THE CITY. CERTAINLY LA PALMA IS THE POP SMALLER CITY IN MY DISTRICT THEY SHOULD NOT BE DOING WHAT FULLER THàNH DOES WHICH IS THE LARGEST PART BUT IF EVERYBODY DOES SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO TACKLE THIS AND- EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE SOME BEST PRACTICES AND BEST MODELS AND THERE'S SOME GREAT LEADERSHIP IF AN ORANGE COUNTY. WE DON'T WANT TO BE LOOKING TEN YEARS FROM NOW SAYING WE DID A LOT BUT WE'RE STILL IN THE SAME SITUATION BUT I THINK YOU- MAYOR DE DAVE SHAWVER YOU HAVE BEEN A LEADER IN THIS AREA AND I APPRECIATE. YOUR WORK AND I KNOW- THE PEOPLE OF YOUR COMMUNITY DO IT TOO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THE ONLY CLOSING NOTE IF YOU PLEASE. WE COULD USE SOME ADDITIONAL HELP THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY WELL WITH RELOCATION THAT IS GOING TO BE KEY TO THE SUCCESS FOR EVERYBODY SO ANY KIND OF THE SPECIAL RELOCATION FUNDING THAT THE STATE COME UP WITH. THE HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD BE AWESOME THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'VE I HEAR YOU ON THAT AND WE HAVE IT LISTED AS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK TOWARDS- OF WORKING ON THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT OUR NEXT A SPEAKER WE HAVE. IS THAT MAN. MS ELIZABETH HANDS BURKE SHE IS THE ORANGE COUNTY REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF U. M. B. NOW WHAT IS JIM B. AND WHAT IS THE MD. FOR SOME OF US AGAIN IN THE CIRCLES THAT WORK ON HOUSING- THAT IS FAMILIAR TO US BUT FOR SOME OF US IT MAY NOT BE NIMBY MEANS. SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT SAY NOT IN MY BACKYARD LIKE I LOVE HOUSING BUT DON'T PUT IT RIGHT HERE PUT IT OVER THERE. YEAH BE MEANS YES IN MY BACKYARD YES WE WANT TO SEE MORE HOUSING- NOW. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO INTO A BIG ARGUMENT HERE BUT THERE'S IN BC AND THERE'S NIMBYS AND WE HAVE ELIZABETH HANDS BURKE HERE- FROM ORANGE COUNTY WELCOME- MS HANS BERG. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- IT'S REALLY AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY AND- I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOUR LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT ON HOUSING YOU REALLY HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION. FOR THE CAUSE OF HOUSING- I WANNA I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT- I'M- THIS PRESENTATION IS STUFF THAT YOU KNOW WHILE ROUTE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KIRK SILVA. SO THIS IS REALLY FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT I'M HOPING TO REACH WITH MY MESSAGE- I WANT TO SAY THAT I STRUGGLED WITH HOW TO TELL THAT STORY. AND I ALWAYS SAY YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD WRITE WHAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU CAN TELL WHAT YOU KNOW S I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU. A STORY THAT I'M GONNA USE OF THE CASE STUDY TO ILLUSTRATE THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING TO YES ONLINE BUILDING PERMITS FOR HOUSING- WE HAVE BEEN HEARING YOU KNOW HOUSING IS HEALTH CARE. I KNOW THAT ORANGE COUNTY HEALTH PROVIDERS PARTICULARLY PROVIDENCE ST JOSEPH HEALTH CENTER THANK YOU MEDICAL CENTER I KNOW THAT THEY KNOW THAT. I KNOW THAT BECAUSE PREVENTION IS WORKING ON IT SO THERE IS DEFINITELY WHERE DOES AND THE HEALTH OUR COMMUNITY. THAT HOUSING IS HEALTH CARE. BECAUSE A LOT OF WORK DONE ADVOCATE- I JUST SHARE SO I. AM NOT TRAINED IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH OR MENTAL HEALTH I AM ACTUALLY TRAINED AS AN URBAN PLANNER. SO MY WORLD REALLY IS- STICKS AND BRICKS AND WHAT DOES IT TAKE. TO PROVIDE THE UNIX RIGHT TO PROVIDE THE FULL USE. THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS NEED TO MOVE OUT OF. A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING OR OUT OF THE SHELTER OR OFF THE STREET AND GO DIRECTLY INTO HOUSING FIRST SO. I'D LIKE TO SHARE I'M- THE DIRECTOR OF THE- I CO FOUNDED THE UNIGROUP ORANGE COUNTY WHICH IS CALLED FOR HOUSING- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND AS OF TWENTY TWENTY WE BECAME A MEMBER OF THE LARGER YOU'D BE ORGANIZATION YOU BE ACTION. AND SO THAT IS WHERE THE TITLE ORANGE COUNTY REGIONAL DIRECTOR COMES FROM BECAUSE YOU BE ACTION IS THAT STATEWIDE AND- EVEN GROWING NATIONAL ORGANIZATION. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M GONNA TAKE YOU ON A LITTLE JOURNEY OF CRIME SO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. ARE THE CITY WAS- I'M SORRY THE COUNTY WAS JUST REALLY STARTING TO GRAPPLE WITH. YOU KNOW HAVING HAVING CLEAR THE RIVER BED WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO. SO THE ORANGE COUNTY UNITED WAY UNDERSTOOD UNDERTAKES THE STUDY THE COST STUDY WITH UCI. THE FINDINGS BUT IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO LEAVE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS THAN IT IS. TO PUT THEM IN PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH THAT LEADS TO BE HER. EFFORT CALLED UNITED TO END HOMELESSNESS RIGHT- AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME THAT THAT IS HAPPENING. I'M NOT A LOT OF NONPROFIT IN FULLER TEN THAT USED TO BE CALLED THAT A FULLER TEN INTERFAITH EMERGENCY SERVICES. I WHICH GUIDES PROVIDE OUR EMERGENCY SHELTER APPROACH. YOUR FULLER CAN WITH THE IDEA TO BUILD SOME PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AT. ALL ON A PIECE OF CITY OWNED LAND WHICH WAS SIXTEEN HUNDRED WEST COMMONWEALTH AVENUE- TO THE CITY ON SITE ARE FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE. ARE THEY THOUGHT ABOUT USING A FOR HOUSING- AND IT IS. IS A BIT OF AN ODD SHAPE- BUT IT IS. IT IS A CITY OWNED LAND. THAT- THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD DO SOME WITH. SO FORWARD TO TWENTY. THE PLAN FOR NEXT BOB THIS PER FOR HOUSING SIXTY IN APARTMENTS HOUSING CHARGES TAKE SHAPE ON THE COUNCIL. AND EXCLUSIVE NEGOTIATING AGREEMENT WITH A PROVIDER PROPER THE POPE I'M NOT THEY HAVE THREE COMMUNITY MEETINGS THEY ARRANGED TOWARDS OTHER PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. PROJECT DEVELOPMENTS IN ORANGE COUNTY- BUT THERE IS THERE'S A LOT OF RESISTANCE TO IT- AND IN FACT THE NIMBYISM OF THAT ARE THAT WHOLE YEAR WAS DOCUMENTED BY JOE WORKABLE FROM- KPCC SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RADIO NPR STATION AND YOU CAN WATCH THAT ONLINE IF YOU IS NOT A IT SOUNDS OF INTEREST BUT- I THE POINT IS THAT. THE CITY AND PATHWAYS REALLY DID- AN EXTENSIVE PUBLIC OUTREACH PROCESS TO TRY TO BUILD SUPPORT OUR INFORM AND EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THIS WOULD BE AND THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT YOU KNOW IT WAS A SHELTER IT WAS A SHELTER WAS A SHELTER. BUT IT WASN'T A SHELTER IT WAS AN APARTMENT BUILDING WITH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO NEEDED THE SERVICE OF THE STATE HOUSE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS REALLY WAS AN APARTMENT BUILDING. NOT UNLIKE MANY OTHER APARTMENT BUILDINGS. SO THIS. OF THE OUR PERMITS FOR IN HOUSE PROPOSED. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF FROM I WE HAD A LOT OF SUPPORTERS WE HAD- SO UNITED. I WHICH IS A NONPROFIT THAT CAME OUT OF ONE OF THE EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN CHURCHES AND IS FUNDED BY OTHER EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN CHURCHES. WE HAD THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCHES IN THE FORM OF THE TRI PARISH ARE HOMELESS COLLABORATIVE WE HAVE THE UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST CONGREGATION OF FULLER TEN WE HAD AN ORGANIZATION CALLED LOCAL PICO- WE HAD FULLER CAN ACT AND WE HAD THE POLLUTION INTERFAITH MINISTERIAL ASSOCIATION. WHY DO I SHARE THIS WITH YOU I SHARE THIS WITH YOU AND ESPECIALLY I'M I'M SPEAKING TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ORDER STAFF MEMBERS. I SHARE THIS WITH YOU BECAUSE FULLER CAN HAVE ADVOCATES WE HAVE PEOPLE IN OUR CITY WHO DO SUPPORT. OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. UNFORTUNATELY ARE THE NIMBYISM. OVERWHELMED THAT YEAR WE WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS- THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH FROM ONE OF THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS. AND THIS QUESTION WHY DO THESE ALMOST PEOPLE GET TO LIVE FREE. AND HOUSING AND I HAVE TO WORK HARD TO PAY FOR MY OWN HOUSING- THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMMARIZES- THE RESPONSE THAT THEY GOT AND SO. ON IN OCTOBER BECAUSE OF MANY FACTORS BUT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE WERE MOVING TOWARDS ELECTION. PATHWAYS DECIDED TO WITHDRAW. OUR PARTY APPLICATION. IN TWENTY NINETEEN. ARE THE FOCUS ACTUALLY SHIPS AWAY FROM HOUSING PERMITS FOR HOUSING AND ACTUALLY SHIFTED SUBURB. AND THIS IS REALLY IN RESPONSE TO EVERYONE KNOWS- JUDGE DAVID O. CARTER'S RULINGS THAT HAVE BEEN BASICALLY SENDING CITIES IF YOU WANT TO ENFORCE YOUR CAMPING WE'RE NOT ANTI CAMPING ORDINANCES YOU NEED TO HAVE. A SHELTER. AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THAT KIND OF MOMENTUM CAME FROM TO VIEW OF THE SHELTER BEDS AND WHEN A PARK AND IN PLACENTIA. ARE AND TO REALLY AND WE DID STEP UP FULLER CAN STEP UP AND SO DID THE OTHER CITIES IN THE NORTH FONG- AND WE ACCOMPLISHED YOU KNOW. DOING SOMETHING THAT THAT UP TO THEN HAD PROVED YOU KNOW VERY DIFFICULT- BUT IT REALLY WAS YOU KNOW IN RESPONSE TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREET AND THE JUDGES TELLING US THAT WE COULDN'T. PUT PROVIDE THEM A PLACE TO BE OTHER THAN THE STREET THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO OUT WE COULDN'T ENFORCE SO IT WAS THAT PRESSURE THAT REALLY CAME TO BEAR- THAT WAS WHAT PUSHED THE CITIES. TO TAKE ACTION- BEFORE TEN. I AM NOT. WAS ABLE PUT TOGETHER THE NAVIGATION CENTER. HELLO MNUCHIN. IS RUNNING WITH YOU HEARD FROM THE START- AND WE SAW THE SAME AB. INFO COME OUT TO SUPPORT THAT SHELTER THE SAME PEOPLE THAT HAD COME. SUPPORT THE SIXTY UNITS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ON THAT LOT. THOSE SAME PEOPLE CAME OUT TO SUPPORT A SHELTER IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION WAS NOT THE SAME LOCATION THAT. THAT IS STILL THERE- BUT JUST TO SHOW YOU THAT WE DO HAVE ROBUST ADVOCATES IN FULLERTON. NOW WE'RE IN TWENTY TWENTY THE CITY IS STARTING AS ALL CITIES ARE TO LOOK AT SITES FOR HOUSING ELEMENT WHERE ARE WE GOING TO PLAY YOU KNOW DO YOU FELT EVERYBODY GOT REALLY LOT HIGH REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT NUMBERS ARENA- AND SO THE CITY IS LOOKING AROUND AND WERE YOU KNOW THINKING TO OURSELVES WHERE. YOU KNOW WHERE COULD WE FIND TO ACCOMMODATE NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT- I WANT TO PUT A PAUSE FOR ONE SECOND AND JUST SHARE THAT- I DID FOUND THE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION- BUT I ALSO SIT ON THE BOARD COMPLAINING COMMISSION I AM IN MY THIRD YEAR ON THE COMMISSION I AM CURRENTLY THAT SHARE THIS YEAR. AND PRIOR TO JOINING THE COMMISSION IN TWENTY NINETEEN I SERVED ON THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT COMMISSION FOR THE CITY OF FULLERTON FOR SIX YEARS AND I. SERVED ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION FOR TWO YEARS SO I HAVE TEN YEARS OF. BEING PART OF THE PUBLIC PROCESS IN THIS TOWN AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY I LOVE THIS TOWN I SERVE THE CITY BECAUSE I LOVE THE CITY SO IN SHARING THE STORY WITH YOU IT'S NOT- I'M I'M SHARING. A STORY THAT'S HARD TO TELL BUT I KNOW THIS STORY BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN IT AND IT IT I THINK THAT MY EXPERIENCE REALLY- WILL HELP TO ILLUSTRATE FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE COULD NOT I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THE STORY ASSEMBLY MEMBER- I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THIS STORY IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS ORANGE COUNTY- SO ANYWAY GOING BACK SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY THE CITY LOOKING FOR SITES FOR THE HOUSING ELEMENT OF THIS SITE SIXTEEN HUNDRED WAS COMMONWEALTH THAT TRIANGLE SITE I CHECKED BEFORE ONCE DECLARED SURPLUS PROPERTY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS THAT ACCORDING TO THE SURPLUS PROPERTY ACT. ON IT HAS TO BE USED FOR OTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR FOR PARKS SPACE OR SOME COMBINATION OF BOTH. I'M THE NOTICE OF AVAILABILITY WINDOWS SEVEN TWO IT SHOULD BE WHICH THAT STANDS FOR BUT THE PART OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN JULY AND THE CITY RELEASES AN RFP FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTH. AND IN. THE DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU STOP HOW I'D WITH THE APPLE. THEY MADE IT CLEAR TO THAT YOU KNOW. PERMITS WHAT OF HOUSING BEEN TRIED ON THE SIDE. DID NOT GO. AND SO THEY WERE WRECKED. FAMILY SO JUST. FOR HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME. BUT NOT BUT NOT HAVING ANY CONNECTION TO ARM. MENTAL HEALTH OR OR IN THE SENSE PERFECT- AND THAT'S IN CONTRAST TO THE FIRST PROJECT THAT WAS PROPOSED WHICH WAS. FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE EXITING HOMELESSNESS ARE EXITING TRANSITIONAL. TO AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT SITE BY MAY HAVE LOOKS LIKE UNDER ONE OF THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD- AND YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU KNOW IT IS AN ODD SHAPED LOT BUT IT'S KIND OF SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN- A MAJOR TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS THAT HAS. A MEDIAN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND THE ROVER TRACKS SO IT REALLYIS A BIT OF A OF AN ISOLATED PARCEL BUT BUT IT IS CONNECTED TO THE REST OF DOWNTOWN IF YOU. IF YOU WALK EAST FROM HERE YOU DO GET TO A COMMUNITY CENTER SO IT IS IT IS CONNECTED BUT IT IS IN SOME WAYS ALSO ISOLATED AT THE SAME TIME- TWENTY TWENTY ONE. OUR CITY STAFF. RELEASES THAT RE RELEASE OF THE THERAPY. THEY GET FOR PROPOSALS AND THE PROPOSALS ARE ALL FROM THE VERY WELL KNOWN- HOW ARE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS IN ORANGE COUNTY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RIGHT. NATIONAL CORE RELATED JAMBOREE AND BETTER HOUSING. AND ON JULY SIXTH. THE CITY COUNCIL IDENTIFIED NATIONAL COURT AS THE PREFERRED. AS THE PREFERRED DEVELOPER. AND IT WAS UNEVENTFUL MEETING AND ONE OF THE COUNCILMAN NOTED THAT IT WAS A RARITY THAT THE NEIGHBORS HAVE NOT COMPLAINED OR OBJECTED TO THE PROJECT. OUT WHICH HE SAID WAS. A REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT. ALL OF THE DEVELOPERS HAD DONE THEIR JOBS VERY WELL AND THAT WHAT THEY WERE PROPOSING TO BUILD WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE IN EVERY CASE AND- JUST TO GO BACK AND- TELL YOU WHAT. WE'RE PROPOSING TO BUILD. OR FIFTY NINE AFFORDABLE FAMILY APARTMENTS. ARE FOR PEOPLE. THAT WERE IT WAS A DEEPER LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY IT WAS AT A VERY LOW INCOME AND LOW INCOME LEVEL- WHICH ARE THE HARDEST TO BUILD IN THE HEART OF THE FUN AND SO THE FACT THAT THIS COULD BE DONE. ON CITY OWNED LAND WAS REALLY WHAT MAKE THAT DEEPER. LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY POSSIBLE. SO DO I SAY FULLER CAN APPROVE. YOU NINE UNIT AFFORDABLE HOUSE COMES NATIONAL CORE WITH THE CHOSEN. AND THEN WE GOT TO TUESDAY AND IT HAPPENED THE CITY HAD AN EXCLUSIVE NICK WAS SUPPOSED TO ENACT AN EXCLUSIVE NEGOTIATING AGREEMENT WITH NATIONAL COURT TO ENABLE THE DEVELOPER TO GO DO THE OUTREACH TO GO DO THE EDUCATION AND- A FEW PEOPLE SHOWED UP THEY NOW AND- THE INTERESTING THING WAS THAT WE HAD SUPPORT FROM ALL OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAD SUPPORTED. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROPOSAL THIS TIME ALL OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THAT THE TRAVERSE COLLABORATIVE THAT YOU SAW THOSE WERE THE FOLKS DRESSED IN WHITE. WE HAD A NEW GROUP WE HAVE THE UNITED WAY HOUSING CHAMPIONS WHICH WAS I AM AN OUTGROWTH OF AGAIN THE UNITED TO END HOMELESSNESS INITIATIVE THAT WAS STARTED BY THE UNITED WAY AND AGAIN THAT WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE STUDY THAT THEY UNDERTOOK SHOWING THAT HOUSING IS LESS EXPENSIVE A WAY TO HELP FOLKS THAN TO KEEP THEM IN FILTERS OR TO KEEP THEM HONEST. MISANTHROPE WE GOT I SPEED UP BUT YEAH A BIT OKAY ARE THAT THAT MEETING THAT HAPPENED ON TUESDAY WAS REALLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME PEOPLE THAT HAD OBJECTED TO THE OTHER ONE ARE THE. OTHER PROPOSAL. AND IT'S IT WE HAVE STALLED NOW ON THIS PROJECT SO WE HAVE FIVE YEARS A DEVELOPER CAN'T SPEAK FUNDING. UNTIL THEY HAVE APPROVALS AND SO NOW THE CLOCK IS RESET ON THE SITE. I'M HERE BECAUSE I HOUSING ADVOCACY I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. IN THIS POPULAR OUR POPULATION IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND. FIFTEEN TENTHS OF A PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION OBJECTIVE THIS WAS A TWEET FROM A MAN WHO ATTENDED THE MEETING AND HE SAID THAT THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND SIGNATURE TWO HUNDRED NINE SIGNATURES AND SIX SPEAKERS. AND THOSE WERE ENOUGH TO DERAIL THE PROJECT AND I'M HERE TO SAY AND TO SHARE WITH YOU MY EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THAT NIMBYISM IS FACTIONALISM IT'S NOT DEMOCRACY AND I'M FIGHTING THIS THIS QUOTE FROM FOUNDING FATHER JAMES MADISON BECAUSE I THINK THAT NIMBYISM WORKS TO THE DETRIMENT. OF THE PERMANENT AGGREGATE INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT IT'S A GROUP OF CITIZENS WHO ARE NOT DOING THE BEST FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. AND I'M SHARING THIS WITH YOU BECAUSE WE DO HAVE HOUSING ADVOCATES EVERY CITY THIS IS A LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING ALL ACROSS ORANGE COUNTY WHERE WE DO HAVE HOUSING ADVOCATES IN EVERY CITY STAM IS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE I WILL SAY THAT I'VE- I AM IMPRESSED WITH WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO. ACCOMPLISH THEIR- SO. MY EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THERE IS SOMETHING WILL IRREPARABLY BROKEN AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABILITY. AND PROCESS TO APPROVE HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. I WANT TO ASK YOU MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE END OF THE SENATE. WHAT IS THE ROLE STATE GOVERNMENT TO ENABLE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON PUBLIC LAND IF THE CITIES ARE NOT ABLE TO PASS IT BECAUSE STANDING IS A VERY UNIQUE PLACE THE REST OF THE CITIES ARE REALLY FACING CHALLENGES. ARE AND YOU KNOW OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE AND THEY'RE NOT. NOT BEING SUCCESSFUL. AND I WANT TO ASK THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE WE NEED TO MAKE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY RIGHT ON PUBLICLY OWNED LAND. WE NEED TO DO FOR PERMITS FOR HOUSING AND DEEPLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR EIGHTY USE WHICH IS TO MAKE IT MINISTERIAL BE APPROVED- BECAUSE- THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW WE ARE FAILING TO BUILD IT WE TRIED TWICE ON THIS ONE PARCEL. AND WE HAVE FAILED TWICE AND IT IS THE SAME SMALL MINOR GROUP OF FOLKS THAT ARE. HERE TO GETTING THIS DONE AND I'M SHARING THIS QUOTE. FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE ORIGINAL- ORGANIZATION PATHWAYS HE SAID THERE IS NO WORLD. IN WHICH IT IS BETTER TO HAVE PEOPLE LIVING ON OUR STREETS THERE'S NO MORAL WORLD THERE'S NO ECONOMIC WORLD THERE'S NO COMMUNITY HEALTH VERSION OF THE WORLD. WHERE IT IS BETTER THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON THE STREET AS OPPOSED TO HOUSING AND IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO DO. SO I SHARE THIS WITH YOU ARE AS A PERSON WHO LOVES OF MY CITY. OUR AND HAPPILY HAS SERVED AND ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE DONE A LOT FULLER HAD TEN HAS DONE A LOT. BUT EVEN THOUGH WITH ALL THAT WE HAVE DONE AND OUR NEIGHBORS HAVE DONE IT IS NOT ENOUGH. AND WE NEED TO MAKE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND DEEPLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING MINISTER REALLY APPROVAL ON PUBLICLY OWNED. THAT IS MY ASK. THAT WOULD MAKE MY LIFE AND THE LIVES OF PEOPLE- THAT SPOKE BEFORE US A LOT EASIER BECAUSE IT WOULD ENABLE THEM TO HAVE A PLACE. TO MOVE. ARE THERE THERE WERE. THAT THEIR CLIENTS INTO. THANK YOU MISS ELIZABETH HANS BERG- WHO- I KNOW YOU WORK PASSIONATELY ON THIS TOPIC AND YOU OPPOSED TO. MANY VERY SERIOUS QUESTIONS TO THOSE LISTENING NOW I WILL TELL YOU I DON'T KNOW WHO HAS TUNED IN WHO OR WHO HAS NOT TUNE DOWN. WE DID INVITE OUR OF A- FRIENDS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE DID INVITE. SOME OF OUR- CITY MANAGERS ARE LIST FOR HOUSING ADVOCATES. BUT I'M NOT SURE WHO IS ON THIS CALL WHAT I WILL SAY. IS THAT- TO PUSH BACK A PRODUCT PROJECT. THAT HAS GONE THROUGH AS YOU SHALL HAVE SHOWN IN MANY MANY PUBLIC OUTREACH MANY TYPES OF PROCESSES IS WHAT IS DELAYING OR TABLING THESE PROJECTS IT'S NOT JUST IN FULLERTON IT'S NOT JUST AN ORANGE COUNTY. IT REALLY IS CROSS THE STATE SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING AND WE TALK ABOUT PRODUCTION WE ARE BUILDING AT A RATE THAT IS LESS THAN THE FORTIES THE NINETEEN FORTIES HOMEOWNERSHIP IS LESS NOW THAN THE NINETEEN FORTIES NINETEEN FIFTIES AND NINETEEN SIXTIES. SO EVEN FOR MIDDLE CLASS WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- RIGHT NOW HOMELESSNESS IN SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WHAT WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT OUR WORKING CLASS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR MIDDLE CLASS WHO CANNOT ATTAIN A HOME. IN MANY TIMES THE PLACES THEY'RE WORKING WE KNOW THAT THAT WE HAVE SEEN AN EXODUS OF PEOPLE LEAVING CALIFORNIA POLITICALLY PEOPLE SAY BECAUSE OF X. Y. NZ ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS IS PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY'RE WORKING AND LONG COMMUTES WHETHER IT'S AN HOUR HOUR AND A HALF OR SIMPLY A QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUE. SO YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT MRS AT MS HANS BERG WHERE WHEN WE SAY NO WE PUSH OFF THE OF PROJECTS WHEN WE HAVE COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT SAYING YES BUT IN SAID STATE. NO OR DELAYED PROJECTS IT ADDS TO THAT PRODUCTION ISSUE. I KNOW THAT- THERE IS MANY MANY PEOPLE INVESTED IN TRYING TO BUILD WHETHER IT'S MARKET RATE OF MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TO BE HONEST WE'RE NOT DOING VERY MUCH OF ANY OF THE HOUSING. AND SOME OF THE BILLS THAT THERE IS OPPOSITION TO THOSE AGAIN PRESENT A NARRATIVE THAT MANY TIMES. ARE NOT THE FACTS OF THE BILL. MANY TIMES THE BILLS HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN READ BEFORE UP PEOPLE ARE SAYING NO TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION SO. WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH HOMELESSNESS WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM HOUSING PRODUCTION AND WE'RE NOT ADDRESS SEEN IT EITHER SO WITHIN ONE WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN AND SAYING WELL CALIFORNIA HASN'T DEALT WITH HOMELESSNESS. IT'S A CRISIS IT'S A IT'S A DISASTER. MY QUESTION IS WHAT IS YOUR SOLUTION IF YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE ON YOUR PARKS IN YOUR BUSINESSES YOU DON'T WANT HOUSING BEING BUILT IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOODS YOU DON'T WANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. IN YOUR COMMUNITIES WHAT IS YOUR SOLUTION BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE ARE FAILING MANY MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING ARE WORKING FAMILIES IN. OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE WILL MOVE TO SOMEBODY WHO IS MOVING FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT- RIGHT NEXT DOOR IN ANAHEIM- MISTER BENJAMIN HURST WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SALVATION ARMY OF ORANGE COUNTY. AND I'M HOPING HE WILL LEAD US INTO THE INDIA INDIAN OF THE SESSION ON A LITTLE MORE UPBEAT NOTE HERE WELCOME. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO THANK- YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY INVITATION. TO JOIN THIS PANEL CHAMPIONS AND CELEBRATE- GREAT INNOVATION AND PROGRESS IN THE BATTLE. AGAINST WHAT WE REALLY BELIEVE IS THE DEFINING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS OF OUR TIME OF COURSE I'M SPEAKING TODAY OF. HOMELESSNESS AND WE CELEBRATE. SO MANY OF THE GREAT THINGS WE'VE HEARD TODAY IT IS SO- HEART WARMING TO HEAR OF OUR COMMUNITY FRIENDS AND ALLIES. IN THE SPACE- FIGHTING- SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH US AGAINST THE RAVAGES OF HOMELESSNESS ACROSS ORANGE COUNTY- LET ME BEGIN. BY A NON BURYING THE LEAD TODAY. LET ME SAY COMPREHENSIVE BELIEVE THAT THE SALVATION ARMY DOESN'T BELIEVE ORANGE COUNTY HAS A HOMELESS CRISIS WE CANNOT SOLVE. A WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A HOMELESS THROUGHPUT PROBLEM THAT TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY AND AS ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE COMMUNITY WE CAN UNITE TOGETHER AND COMPREHENSIVELY AND COLLECTIVELY SOL. AT THE SALVATION ARMY BELIEVES THAT OUR FRIEND OUR NEIGHBOR OUR LOVED ONE SOMEONE AYE AFFECTIONATELY CALL METAPHORICALLY JOE HOMELESS. CAN EXPERIENCE COMPREHENSIVE LIFE TRANSFORMATION AND EMERGE. LIKE A PHOENIX OUT OF THE BROKEN ASHES OF YESTERDAY AS JOE SO. COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTOR THERE WE EVEN SAY TODAY JOSEPH FUTURE TAX PAYER AND EXPERIENCE THE PERSONAL DIGNITY OF VICTORIA'S AUTONOMOUS LIVING AGAIN I WANT TO TOUCH ON THAT BECAUSE THE SALVATION ARMY IS ONE THE LARGEST PRIVATE SHELTER OPERATORS IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE OVER THIRTY THOUSAND BEDS NATIONWIDE IN THE LOW BARRIER SHELTER SPACE WE ARE ALSO ON THE FRONT LINES OF HOUSING FIRST DEVELOPMENT OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND I AM SHARING AN IMAGE OF OUR ICONIC- CAMPUS UNDER WAY IN ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA THE CENTER OF HOPE THAT WILL HAVE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS AS A HOUSING FIRST RESPONSE TO THE HOMELESS CRISIS AND- TO BUILD ON WHAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS SAID TODAY. YOU NEED A GREAT PARTNER IN THIS DEBATE AND WE'RE APPRECIATIVE OF- THE LEADERSHIP IN THE CITY OF ANAHEIM PARTICULARLY TO DEPARTMENT HEAD LEVEL THAT HAS NOT REALLY LOCKED ARMS AND REMOVED ALL OBSTACLES TO SEEING ALMOST HOUSING GO UP AT THE CENTER OF HOPE SO I WHAT I WANT TO TURN THIS CONVERSATION IF I COULD IN A UNIQUE DIRECTION FOR JUST. A FEW MINUTES WITH MY TIME TODAY. TUCKED AWAY A QUIET STREET OFF LOUIS STREET IN ANAHEIM IS THE SALVATION ARMY ADULT REHABILITATION CENTER. AND THE REASON I DRAW ATTENTION TO THAT TODAY AT THIS TO STEAM PANEL IS THE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE A. R. C. HAS HELPED- MEN AND WOMEN. THAT COME TO THEM IN THE DEATH GRIP OF THE SERIOUS DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION. AND TODAY PER RESIDENTS THAT GRADUATE THAT SIX MONTH PROGRAM. WE SEE AN ASTONISHING ONE YEAR MARK. THAT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH BUT COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF 8% THAT IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY. SO I STOPPED BERMAN. AND I ASKED THE QUESTION WILL WANNA HOMELESS- HOUSING PANEL WHAT I LEAD WITH THE STORY OF RECOVERY- WE DO THAT BECAUSE THE LIFE STORY SCENE AND THAT RECOVERY SPACE ARE ALL TOO OFTEN SIMILAR TO THE BROKEN LIVES WE DEAL WITH THAT ARE HOMELESS SHELTER. FOR TOO MANY OF THOSE THAT IN OUR A. R. C. RECOVERY PROGRAMS FAMILIES OF ALL BUT GIVEN UP FUNCTIONAL HOPE. SOCIETY HAS ALL BUT TURNED OUR BACK ON THE PROSPECT THAT THESE- FRIENDS NEIGHBORS LOVED ONES IN THE SHELTERS WILL HAVE ANY FUTURE. AND YET THE LESSONS LEARNED IN THAT RECOVERY SPACE TELL US LOUDLY TODAY THAT OUR BATTLE AGAINST THE PURSE THE RAVAGES OF HOMELESSNESS. WE AS A SOCIETY DO NOT HAVE TO GIVE UP. THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY DO NOT HAVE TO SURRENDER CAN YOU IMAGINE WITH ME. AND IN THE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF TWO WORDS OF OUR ANAHEIM EMERGENCY SHELTER THAT I'VE GIVEN THE CIVIC LEADERS ACROSS THE SOUTH LAND. I INVITE YOU TO IMAGINE IF WE COULD SEE. A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF OUR HOMELESS FRIENDS JOURNEY THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM THAT LIBERATES THEM FROM THE CRIPPLING BOND AGES OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE THAT REACTIVATES THEIR ABILITY TO WORK AND HOLD WELL PAYING JOB THAT BRINGS HOPE TO THEIR OUTLOOK ON LIFE. AND RESTORATION TO THEIR BROKEN FAMILY SUPPORT STRUCTURES WHAT IF WE WITNESS EVEN A THIRTIES MONUMENTAL ENDEAVOR WE DARE SAY TOGETHER TODAY WITH ASPIRATION IN OUR HEARTS IT WOULD CHANGE THE STORY ARC OF HOMELESSNESS IN THE UNITED STATES. AND SO IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAVE BEEN ON A QUEST AT THE SALVATION ARMY IN ORANGE COUNTY TO BRING TOGETHER ALL THE BEST AND BOLDEST ELEMENTS OF OUR COMMUNITY HOMELESS INITIATIVES AND. HOPE CENTER HOPE TODAY IS HOME TO THE SALVATION ARMY ADULT REHABILITATION CENTER WITH ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE BEDS FOR MEN AND WOMEN EXPERIENCING RECOVERY FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE ADDICTION THE CENTER OF HOPE TODAY IS HOME. TWO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BED LOW BARRIER EMERGENCY SHELTER GIVING IMMEDIATE TRIAGE OFF THE STREETS. AT THE CENTER OF HOPE WILL BE HOME. TO DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS AND A HOUSING FIRST EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS. AS OUR HOUSING UNITS BREAK GROUND IN DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR. THE CENTER OF HOPE. WILL BE HOME TO THE HOMELESS THROUGHPUT SYSTEM BEING ROLLED OUT NOW. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY OF ANAHEIM AND- COUNTY OF ORANGE. AND COMMUNITY- PARTNERS ACROSS THE REGION. SO WE TALKED TODAY IF I COULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE HOMELESS THROUGHPUT SYSTEM WHERE. THE FIRST BASE REPRESENTS THE GREAT WORK BEING DONE AT LOW BARRIER SHELTERS EVERYWHERE SERVING AS VITAL ENTRY POINTS ON A CONTINUUM OF CARE. THAT LEAVES THEM UPON EXPRESSWAY OF RAPID HOUSING PLACEMENT. BUT WE ALL KNOW TOGETHER. WE DON'T WANT OUR RESIDENTS RESIDING IN SHELTERS VERY LONG THIS IS TRIAGE SPACE. THE ARCH CARE WE'RE TOGETHER WITH- FRIENDS LIKE POLLY ONET THE ILLUMINATION FOUNDATION WHERE WE DO TRIAGE CARE AND LEVERAGE ALL OUR COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO BRING VICTORY IN THAT SPACE AND WE MOVE THEM AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO SECOND BASE. HOUSING FIRST INITIATIVES IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AND RAPID RE HOUSING BECAUSE WE KNOW STATISTICALLY THAT RESIDENTS PLACED QUICKLY INTO HOUSING. HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS RATE AS MANY AS 80% HAVE A HOUSING RETENTION MARC. IT THE TO YOUR POINT. SO WE WANT TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES OF AMERICA'S THIRTY YEAR POLICY OF HOUSING FIRST AND GET THEM HOUSE QUICK. BUT HONESTY DEMANDS TODAY THAT THE CONVERSATION CANNOT STOP THERE WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL THAT HOUSING EFFORTS ALONE. CANNOT SOLVE THE HOMELESS CRISIS I AM DEEPLY MOVED BY THE STORY THAT I TELL THIS IN A NONPARTISAN WAY OF THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO GAVIN NEWSOM IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR HOW HE CALLED A PRESS CONFERENCE AND ANNOUNCED. THERE WOULD BE A RATIFICATION OF WIDESPREAD HOMELESSNESS IN SAN FRANCISCO INTENT WITHIN TEN YEARS BECAUSE THE THEY DEVOTE EXTRAORDINARY RESOURCES IN THE CITY TO BUILDING AND HOUSING AND MOBILIZING AND I'M DEEPLY MOVED BY THAT STORY BECAUSE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THEY DID SPEND ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ON HOMELESS SERVICES. OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS THEY DID SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND INTO HOMELESS HOUSING IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT. AND YET WHEN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE FOLLOWED UP ON THE PRESS CONFERENCE TEN YEARS LATER. WE HUNG OUR HEAD IN DISAPPOINTMENT AS THE CITY'S HOMELESS COUNT WENT UP 3% AFTER ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS SPENT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HOUSE. EDIT IT TOLD US A LESSON IN OUR NATIONAL ECONOMIST APPOINTED OUR ATTENTION TODAY. THAT FOR REASONS WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY- WE HAVE TO BUILD TEN UNITS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING TO SEE A NET ONE INDIVIDUAL DECREASE IN A COMMUNITY POINT IN TIME COUNT. AND THESE ARE FISCAL MODELS THAT NO COMMUNITY CAN SUSTAIN SO WE GO BACK TO THIS ISSUE. WE WANT SHELTERED WE WANT HOUSING. WE'RE BUILDING HOUSING AT THE CENTRE POPE IN ACROSS THE ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY. BUT WE WANT TO PUT THE ATTENTION ON THE DINING. IN THE DIAMOND OF THE BASE PATH WHICH IS THIRD BASE. WHICH FOCUSES ON COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY RE INTEGRATION YOU SEE WE BELIEVE THAT WITH ADVANCED SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT WITH COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY APPLICATIONS WITH THERAPEUTIC WORK REINTEGRATION MODELS WE HAVE SEEN AFTER THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF DOING IT SUCCESSFULLY IN THEIR COVERAGE BASED. WE KNOW WE CAN SEE LIFE REHABILITATION AND EVEN COMMUNITY REINTEGRATION WHETHER ALMOST FRIENDS NEIGHBORS LOVED ONES AND WE BELIEVE THIS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS SPACE. THE SALVATION ARMY AND OUR FRIENDS ON THIS PANEL TODAY WE DON'T SAY THIS IS AN EXCLUSIONARY WAY WE SAY THIS IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY. AND WE HAD NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM ENDEAVOR TO WAREHOUSE PEOPLE WITH NO HOPE FUTURE DESTINY OR PURPOSE. WE WANT TO GET THEM HOUSING GET THEM HOUSE RAPIDLY. WHAT'S AROUND THEM WITH THE BREAKTHROUGH CARE STRATEGY- THEY CAN INTRODUCE THEM TO A LIFE OF VICTORIA'S AUTONOMOUS LIVING AGAIN- WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE FUTURE OF HOMELESSNESS CARE IT'S A FUTURE THAT TAKES THE CONVERSATION BE ON. JUST HOUSING. AND SAYS LET'S GET HOLISTIC LIFE TRANSFORMATION GOING IN THIS SPACE LET'S GET. EVEN BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE RE INTEGRATED INTO SOCIETY AND A VICTORIOUS WAY. AND IN DOING SO- WE ASPIRE ARE THE BEST THINGS THAT AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT. THAT'S REALLY ON MY HEART TODAY I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND THE INVITATION TO SHARE ON THIS EXTRAORDINARY PANEL AND I WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALL MY FRIENDS AND THE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS. DOING IN THIS SPACE THANK YOU AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK SILVA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BENJAMIN HURST THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SALVATION ARMY OF ORANGE COUNTY AND THE NEWEST PROJECT THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON- THE CENTER OF HOPE IN ANAHEIM. AND I REALLY THINK THAT- YOUR- INDIEN OUR PANEL ON REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT WHICH IS PEOPLE AND SO OFTEN WE USE THE WORD HOMELESSNESS- PEOPLE DON'T. HAVE THE FACE OR THE STORY I AND A AND A TO OFTEN IT IS REDUCED TO THEY OR THEM AND WHAT YOU KNOW WHY DO WE NEED TO CARE ABOUT THIS IN YOUR PASSION BY THE WAY YOU SPEAK. AND THE SENSE OF RESTORING LIVES IN THE SENSE OF. THE IDEA THAT NOT ONLY CAN ANALYZE TO BE RESTORED BUT WE CAN EVEN GET PEOPLE BACK TO A NOT ONLY ENGAGING IN SOCIETY BUT CONTRIBUTING I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE VERY INSPIRED BY- YOU ARE FINISHING OFF HERE.

THAT'S NOT THE COMPLETE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM IF I HAD SUPPORTING NAVIGATORS BETTER FUNDED OUT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT THAT BE A CASELOAD OF FORTY THREE SIXTEEN HUNDRED. I THINK I CAN TRACK THEM. IF I ACTUALLY HAD EVERYBODY IN THE C. S. SYSTEM. EVENTUALLY EVERYBODY HAD A PLAN- SO IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING WHEN. IF WE CAN'T GET NAVIGATION MAPS WE CAN'T GET THINGS THAT ARE VERY SIMPLE AND TAKE VERY LITTLE TIME TO DO- AND THEN SPEND TONS OF MONEY TRADING STOCKS- I DON'T WANT TO SOUND NEGATIVE I'M NOT NEGATIVE AT ALL. BUT I'M VERY WELL INFORMED. AND I WISH CENTER WINNER TO GET BACK THAT BILL THAT WAS GOING TO OPEN UP THE PROPERTY ON THE EDUCATION. AND BAY COMMUNITY.

THAT'S GOING TO PUT THEM HOUSING THERE DROPPED OUT THE SODAS LIKE HELL MOCKINGBIRD BACK VENTURA. OR LIKE SYNERGY UP IN SAN FRANCISCO. OR JUST HOMELESS WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY GONNA BE HOMELESS PIZZA PROPERTY THEY'RE- AND BEAR SHARE THEIR VIEW.

REAL HAS FIFTY AS A FIFTEEN HUNDRED UNITS. WIDE OPEN SPACES SERVICES ALL AROUND IT. ON TWENTY FIVE ACRES AND THEY'RE LOOKING MORE TO THREE HUNDRED UNIT BETTER AND VILLAGE IN COSTA MESA SO. I'M JUST A REALIST. AND I JUST FELT LIKE BOTTOM. A SMALL SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE CONTROLLING EVERYTHING. AND IF THEY WERE NOT AND BLOCKING THE COMMUNITY AND NOT LETTING THE COMMUNITY AND BE INVOLVED AT ALL IT'S VERY SAD AND FRUSTRATING.
