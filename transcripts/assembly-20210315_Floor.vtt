01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:44.059
EMPLOYEE. THAT SIX THAT'S

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:46.161
EXPOSED TO COVER NINETEEN AND

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:47.629

PUTTING THEMSELVES IN THE

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:52.100
COMMUNITY AND LEE AT RISK SO I

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:52.701
WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A FAIR

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:54.502
COMPROMISE. THIS IS A FAIR

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:57.739
COMPROMISE I APPLIED MY

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.808
COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WHO

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:00.842

FOR FINDING A FAIR NUMBER IN

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.916
THERE. BUT TWO OTHER THINGS I

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:11.486
THINK CAN'T GO IGNORED- ONE

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:12.887
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:14.322
GLOBAL PANDEMIC IT'S WINDING

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:28.303
THAT THE END IS NEAR THIS HAS A

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:30.338
SUNSET OF SEVERAL MONTHS DOWN

01:23:30.405 --> 01:23:30.805
THE ROAD AT THE END OF

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:34.209
SEPTEMBER. AND THEN LASTLY- THE

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:35.543
CERTAINLY THIS IS MONEY THAT'S

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.879

FUNDED SO I THINK THIS WAS A

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:55.296
FAIR FAIR COMPROMISE. IS TIME

YEAR AGO WHEN THIS PANDEMIC

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:15.417

WE ARE MAKING WORKERS CHOOSE

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:32.200
BETWEEN GETTING COVERED

PERHAPS GETTING A DEADLY VIRUS.

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.475
I HEAR FROM MY CONSTITUENTS ALL

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:42.710
THE TIME IT COMES OF COMES TO

01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:43.344
MIND IS THERE WAS A BAKERY IN

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:44.979
MY DISTRICT. WHERE THERE WAS A

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:47.248
WORKER. WHO'S AFRAID TO GET

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:48.917
TESTED. THEY WERE VERY

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:49.918
IRRESPONSIBLE BUT THEY'RE

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:51.786
AFRAID TO GET TESTED BECAUSE

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:53.154
THEY DID NOT WANT TO HAVE TO

01:24:53.221 --> 01:24:54.923
MISS WORK AND GUESS WHAT

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:56.591
HAPPENED VERY PREDICTABLE. THEY

01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:57.559
CAME TO WORK AND EVICTED

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:59.027
EVERYONE SOME PEOPLE OUT SHE

01:24:59.093 --> 01:25:00.562
WENT TO THE HOSPITAL AND THAT

01:25:00.628 --> 01:25:02.897
BUSINESS HAD TO SHUT DOWN FOR

01:25:02.964 --> 01:25:05.533
WEEKS FOR WEEKS. AND THAT IS

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.868
INCOME THAT HURTS THE FAMILY

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:08.937
SMALL BUSINESS BUT THEY ARE

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.405
TAKING MORE PRECAUTIONS THAN

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:11.873
EVER AND UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:12.774
THEY CANNOT HAVE THEIR

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:14.776
EMPLOYEES MAKE THAT CHOICE

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:17.145
BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE TO MAKE

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:18.213
THAT CHOICE. YOU'D RATHER. IT

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:19.914
RATHER CHOOSE YOUR YOUR

01:25:19.981 --> 01:25:21.916
IMMINENT SURVIVAL. THAN AND

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:24.118
ROLL THE DICE ON A ON A VIRUS

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:25.420
AND THAT'S NOT HOW IT SHOULD BE

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:27.388
TO HELP COULD BE. I HAVE

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:28.857
WORKERS IN MY DISTRICT WHO WORK

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:30.225
AT RETAIL MALLS AND RETAIL

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:32.527
SHOPS. THAT ARE UPHOLD EARLIER

01:25:32.594 --> 01:25:33.895
DURING THE SURGE WHEN WE RAISE

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:36.097
THE CAPACITIES AND THEY WERE

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:37.966
AFRAID TO GET TESTED. BECAUSE

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:39.033
THOSE WORKERS WHO WORK AT THE

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.301
RESTAURANTS AND WORK AT STORES

01:25:40.368 --> 01:25:42.237
ARE THE ONES WHO CYCLE AND SEE

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:43.304
LOTS OF CUSTOMERS AND THEY'RE

01:25:43.371 --> 01:25:44.906
THE ONES WHO POTENTIALLY. COULD

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.541
GET CALVET. AND YET THE SAME

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:47.809
TIME EVEN THOUGH THE EXPOSURE

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:49.244
IS HIGH AND THEY KNOW IT

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:50.912
THEY'RE FREE TO GET TESTED. BE

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.247
SIMPLY THERE WAS NO SOCIAL

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:54.082
SAFETY NET FOR THESE PEOPLE

01:25:54.148 --> 01:25:55.183
THERE WAS NO PAID SICK LEAVE.

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:56.985
AND I'M- FRANKLY YOU KNOW OF

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:57.619
COURSE THAT WE HEAR FROM A LOT

01:25:57.685 --> 01:25:58.586
OF PEOPLE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE IN

01:25:58.653 --> 01:25:59.654
SACRAMENTO MENTIONED THAT THERE

01:25:59.721 --> 01:26:00.688
A LOT OF FOLKS WHO WANT TO SEE

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:01.923
THIS GO DOWN FURTHER FROM

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.758
TWENTY FIVE. TO TWENTY FOUR

FIFTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:12.734
THIRTY. LOWER AMOUNTS SO THAT

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.535
PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY BE

01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:15.803
COVERED. LOWER SMALL BUSINESSES

01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:17.739
AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE. TO

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:19.974
BE COVERED. BY BASICALLY.

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.456
THING TO DO. THINK ABOUT IT NOT

OPEN UP A COMPUTER AT HOME. AND

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:21.836
WORK FROM HOME. THEY WERE THAT

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.037
THEY WERE THE FRONT LINE

01:27:23.104 --> 01:27:25.306
WORKERS AT THE GROCERY STORE.

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:26.074

FAST FOOD PEOPLE AT BANKS.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:32.947
PEOPLE WHO KEPT CALIFORNIA

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:36.084
GOING THE REST OF US WERE

01:27:36.150 --> 01:27:36.684
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO

01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:39.253
WORK FROM HOME. THIS BILL IS

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:43.257
ABOUT EQUITY AND FAIRNESS. FOR

01:27:43.324 --> 01:27:45.893
THOSE WHO SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:46.494
SO THAT WE CAN PUT FOOD ON THE

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:51.032
TABLE. I'M GONNA SAY THAT AGAIN

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:53.267

CALIFORNIA GOING. AND PUT THEIR

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:03.544
LIVES AT RISK. IT'S THE RIGHT

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:04.412
THING TO DO AND IT'S THE HUMANE

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:06.214
THING TO DO WE SPENT A LOT OF

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.816
TIME LAST YEAR. TALKING ABOUT

01:28:08.883 --> 01:28:12.887
EQUITY. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME.

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:16.024
FIGHTING FOR EQUITY. THIS IS

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:17.725
OUR OPPORTUNITY TO BRING SOME

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:20.895
OF THAT EQUITY HOME. BECAUSE

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:23.564
FRONT LINE WORKERS LITERALLY

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:24.165
ARE PUTTING THEIR JOBS ON THE

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:28.369
LINE. AND WHAT'S MORE SMALL

01:28:28.436 --> 01:28:31.239
BUSINESSES ARE EXEMPTED. SO

01:28:31.305 --> 01:28:34.509
THAT ARGUMENT. FOR MOST OF US

01:28:34.575 --> 01:28:37.078
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IMPACT OUR

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:38.713
MOMS BUT A MOM AND POP

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.249
BUSINESSES NO LONGER THERE.

01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:42.583
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MULTI

01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:46.654
MILLION DOLLAR BUSINESSES HERE.

01:28:46.721 --> 01:28:48.723
AND WHAT'S MORE IS THAT COULD

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:49.290
BE REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:53.361
GOVERNMENT. NOW WE SEE THE

01:28:53.428 --> 01:28:55.129
NUMBERS ARE DECLINING ABETTING

01:28:55.196 --> 01:28:55.730
AND QUANTIFIERS THAT'S A GOOD

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:58.166
THING. BUT WHERE THERE'S VALUES

01:28:58.232 --> 01:29:00.401
THERE'S PEAKS AND THE PEAKS ARE

01:29:00.468 --> 01:29:02.804
IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. WHERE

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:05.406
FOLKS HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK.

01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:06.541
I ASK EACH ONE OF OUR

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:08.710
COLLEAGUES TO TAKE A VOTE. VOTE

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:11.546
YES. FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:29:11.612 --> 01:29:11.979
THOSE PEOPLE IN OUR

01:29:12.046 --> 01:29:16.050
NEIGHBORHOOD. WHO ARE JANITORS

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:18.920
WHO CLEAN OUR HOMES. WILL GIVE

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:22.056
US FAST FOOD OR GROCERY WORKERS
