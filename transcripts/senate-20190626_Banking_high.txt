YOU'RE GONNA OUTLINE OUR AUTHORS AMENDMENTS ARE YOU. AT SOME POINT [inaudible] OKAY. SO I'M I'M HERE TO PRESENT A. B. NINE FOUR FIVE IT'S IT'S A THE MEASURE RELATE TO A LOCAL AGENCIES IN OUR ABILITY TO INVEST THEIR SURPLUS FUNDS. IN SECURE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS CALLED RECIPROCAL DEPOSITS I DO WANNA KNOW TOO THAT WE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION I BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO COME TESTIFIED THAT WE HAVE REMOVED. OPPOSITION THIS BILL IS PERMISSIVE IT WOULDN'T REQUIRE A LOCAL ENTITY TO DO SO BUT PROVIDES THEM WITH AN OPTION IF IT MAKES FINANCIAL SNSE FOR THEM -- CURRENT LAW PLACES MANY RESTRICTIONS ON TYPE INVESTMENT OF SURPLUS FUNDS FROM LOCAL AGENCIES MAY BE INVESTED IN THOSE RESTRICTIONS INCLUDE -- MAKING SURE THE INVESTMENTS HAVE HIGH LIQUIDITY AND DO NOT POSE A HIGH A RISK TO THE LOCAL AGENCY -- THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THOSE RESTRICTIONS BUT SIMPLY INCREASES BY 20% -- THE AMOUNT THAT AGENCIES SURPLUS MAY BE INVESTED -- THIS REALLY WILL HELP OUR COMMUNITY BANKS AND FRANKLY COMMUNITY BANKS ARE IMPORTANT TO REINVEST IN OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO HEAR FROM SOME RIGHT HERE. I CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION WITH WHICH HAS A CAP ON THESE RECIPROCAL DEPOSITS. WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR CAUTION BUT WE THINK THIS HAS ENOUGH SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE THAT WILL NOT PLACE. UNDUE RISK TO LOCAL FUNDS NOR ARE TAXPAYERS. THESE FUNDS ARE FULLY INSURED AND THE FDIC PROGRAMS REQUIRED BY LAW. AND ESSENTIALLY WILL HELP OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE SMART INVESTMENTS BUT ALSO GET BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES WITH ME TODAY ARE REPRESENTS FROM RIVER CITY BANK AND FIVE STAR BANK AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION.

NEXT UP ON THE FUTURE OF THE DAY AB [inaudible] FIVE THREE NINE HI. SOMEONE WOMAN LEMOND AND MR GRAY SHIRT. GRAYSON I'M SORRY WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENCE HERE. AND WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THE END REGULATED INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA HAS LED TO AN EXPLOSION OF HIGH COST LOANS OVER THE PAST DECADE. THESE LONE STAR AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND HAVE INTEREST RATES FROM ONE HUNDRED TO MORE THAN FAR TOO OFTEN CONSUMERS ARE UNABLE TO REPAY THESE EXPENSIVE LOANS. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STATES THAT 30% OF THE LARGE. OF A LARGE SAMPLE OF HIGH COST LOAN FROM LENDERS THAT OPPOSE THIS BILL WERE RECENT WERE SENT TO COLLECTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE CONSTANT PRESSURE FROM DEBT COLLECTORS THIS PROCESS RESULTS IN DAMAGE CREDIT FROM FOR THE CONSUMER AND CAN ALSO LEAD TO THEIR PAYCHECK BEING GARNISHED THEIR BANK ACCOUNT BEING CLOSED. AND THEIR CAR BEING REPOSSESSED. MORE THAN ONE OUT OF THREE TIMES THESE LOANS LEAVE PEOPLE WORSE OFF THAN WHEN THEY STARTED. I CANNOT THINK OF ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT FEELS SO OFTEN WITHOUT GOVERNMENT STEPPING IN TO INTERVENE. HI COST LENDERS WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL SAY THAT THEY NEED TO CHOP CHARGE SUCH HIGH RATES TO MAKE UP FOR THE CONSUMERS WHO DEFAULT. HOWEVER HOW HIGH INTEREST RATES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN MAKING THESE LOANS AND AFFORDABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. LET'S WALK THROUGH A COMPARISON. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE A TWO YEAR TWENTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN WHICH IS FAIRLY CALL IT WHICH IS A FAIRLY COMMON PRODUCT IN THE MARKET. IF THE CONSUMER GET THIS LOAN FROM A LENDER CHARGING 36% THEIR MONTHLY. PAYMENT WOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AND THEY WOULD PAY BACK A TOTAL OF THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER THE LIFE OF THE LOAN. ON THE OTHER HAND IF A CONSUMER GETS THIS LOAN FROM A HIGH COST PROVIDER THEIR MONTHLY PAYMENT WOULD JUMP TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS AND THEY WOULD PAY BACK A TOTAL OF NEARLY ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. ON THAT TWENTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS UNREGULATED SPACE ARE CLEAR. THE HIGH INTEREST RATES ALLOW LENDERS REMAIN SUSTAINABLY PROFITABLE EVEN WHEN ONE THIRD OR MORE OF THEIR BARS ULTIMATELY DEFAULT ON THE LOAN. AB FIVE THIRTY NINE WILL PUT A STOP TO THIS REGION INCENTIVE STRUCTURE. THE IDEA THAT CONSUMERS WILL NOT HAVE CREDIT OPTION IF THIS BILL PASSES IS NOT REALISTIC THE LENDERS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL HAVE FOUND WAYS TO OFFER AFFORDABLE CREDIT OPTIONS TO BARS WITH DAMAGE CREDIT OR EVEN NO CREDIT SCORE AT ALL. AND LET'S BE CLEAR CALIFORNIA IS AN OUTLINE HERE WE ARE AMONG A SMALL MINORITY OF STATES THAT DO NOT CAP INTEREST RATES ON THESE LOANS. THIRTY EIGHT OTHER STATES HAVE INTEREST RATE CAPS SIMILAR TO OR LOWER THAN WHAT THIS BILL PROPOSES. I HAVE WORKED HARD TO FIND A COMPROMISE THAT WOULD EARN THE SUPPORT FROM BOTH CONSUMER GROUPS AND LENDERS ALIKE AND AB FIVE THIRTY NINE IS A RESULT OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. WE HAVE A STRONG AND BROAD COALITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT LABOR ORGANIZATIONS RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND VETERANS GROUPS TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. I WILL NOW TURN MY TIME OVER TO MY JOIN AUTHOR MISTER TIM GRAYSON WHO HAS BEEN A VALUABLE PARTNER WITH ME IN THESE EFFORTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATORS AND ALSO TO MY COLLEAGUE IN JOINT AUTHOR MISLIM ON FOR THREE YEARS I HAVE SERVED ON THE ASSEMBLY BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEE. AND LIKE MANY OF YOU I HAVE SEEN THAT THE CURRENT SMALL DOLLAR MARKETPLACE IS BROKEN AND THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN OUT LOANS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO FAIL. HOWEVER I HAVE ALSO BEEN WARY OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF PREVIOUS LEGISLATION. I'VE STRUGGLED WITH BALANCING THE CLEAR NEEDS OF SUB PRIME BORROWERS TO ACCESS CAPITAL WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE ARE FAIR AND DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED. WHERE IS THE RIGHT BALANCE HOW DO WE ENSURE CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT MARKETS CAN FUNCTION? THESE ARE NOT EASY QUESTIONS AND THEY HAVE NO EASY ANSWERS THAT BEING SAID WE MUST RECOGNIZE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT AB FIVE THIRTY NINE PRESENTS US TODAY. FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PASS A BILL OUT OF THE SENATE AND IS SUPPORTED BY LENDERS CONSUMER GROUPS. FAITH LEADERS LABOR ORGANIZATIONS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND A BIPARTISAN COALITION OF LEGISLATORS WE ESPECIALLY MY COLLEAGUE IN A GREAT TEAM HAVE SPENT THE LAST NINE MONTHS WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS. THE ISSUE TO CRAFT A BALANCED PIECE OF LEGISLATION. WE ALL KNOW THERE IS STILL OPPOSITION. THEY WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT ACCESS TO CAPITAL ANCILLARY PRODUCTS I HEAR THEIR ARGUMENTS. I JUST RECEIVED AS WELL I JUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. THE ANALYSIS BEFORE YOU POINTS OUT THAT NEARLY 40% OF TRIPLE DIGIT LOANS END IN COLLECTIONS. LET ME REPEAT THAT ALMOST 40% OF LOANS AND IN COLLECTIONS THAT OR TRIPLE DIGIT LOANS REALLY GIVING PEOPLE ACCESS TO CREDIT OR THEY JUST GIVING DEBT COLLECTORS ACCESS TO PEOPLE. OPPOSITION WILL ALSO TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE THE ONLY LENDERS SERVING THE SUBPRIME MARKET. THIS HAS CONCERNED ME FOR A LONG TIME TO HOWEVER YESTERDAY WE SENT YOUR OFFICES DATA SHOWING THAT LENDERS SUPPORTING THIS BILL. ARE MAKING LOANS TO THE SAME COMPS CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS BEING SERVICED TRIPLE DIGIT LENDERS -- BY DROUGHT TRIPLE DIGIT LENDERS SEC FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES SHOW THAT THIS IS TRUE FOR EXAMPLE ONE WONDER IN OUR SUPPORT COALITION MAKES 40% OF THEIR LOAN SPREAD BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE FIGHT BECAUSE SCORES. IT IS SIMPLY AN ACTOR TO ARGUE THAT IF THIS BILL GOES INTO EFFECT NOBODY WILL BE LEFT TO SERVICE THE SUBPRIME MARKET. OPPOSITION WILL ALSO TALKED ABOUT ANCILLARY PRODUCTS. THEY WILL POINT TO EXAMPLES OF LOANS AND OTHER STATES TO EXPLAIN WHY ANCILLARY PRODUCTS HIDE THE TRUE COST OF THE LOAN. AND OUR STATE WE KNOW THIS IS NOT THE CASE THESE PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED AND ADD JUST SMALL AMOUNTS TO THE TOTAL COST OF LOANS. ANYWHERE BETWEEN ONE TO TEN DOLLARS A MONTH. COMPARED TO THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN INTEREST TOMORROW WILL PAY ON A TRIPLE DIGIT LOAN WE ARE REALLY -- COMPARING APPLES TO BOWLING BALLS THAT'S NOT APPLES TO ORANGES. APPLES TO BOWLING BALLS AGAIN I DO NOT WANT TO UNDERESTIMATE THE CHALLENGE OF THE POLICY CHOICE THAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY. BUT I WANT TO BUY DO WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THIS LEGISLATION PROVIDES THE BEST OPPORTUNITY IN YEARS TO BRING FAIR THIS INTO THE SMALL DOLLAR LENDING MARKETPLACE. SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF AB FIVE THIRTY NINE I'VE SPENT TIME AROUND MY DISTRICT TALKING TO CONSTITUENTS ABOUT SMALL DOLLAR INTEREST RATES. WITHOUT FAIL THEY ARE SHOCKED TO THE WE HAVE ALLOWED THE CURRENT MARKET PLACE TO PERSIST. I'VE HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES OF ECONOMIC RUIN AND WITHOUT FAIL THE STORIES OR FROM THE MOST ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND THE PEOPLE MOST IN NEED OF THOUGHTFUL REGULATIONS. THIS BILL IS THAT THOUGHTFUL REGULATION I THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ODD TO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT HERE YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BAFFERT AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS STAR SEE FROM THE JUNIOR AND I'M THE SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE GREATER SACRAMENTO -- MAINLY. THE URBAN HAS BEEN SERVING THIS COMMITTEE FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AND THE SO WHY MORE IN A HUNDRED YEARS. OUR MISSION IS TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC SELF RELIANCE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND PEOPLE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES PREDATORY. LANDING HURTS OUR COMMUNITY AND IT'S AGAINST OUR PRINCIPLES AND MISSION OF THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AND AND THE NATIONAL. EARLY. AND THAT IS WHY I'M HERE TODAY TO VOICE OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY NINE WE JOIN MORE THAN A HUNDRED STATE COMMUNITY INFECTION OF ORGANIZATIONS LABOR CITIES COUNTIES AND LENDERS. AND SUPPORT OF THIS. HISTORIC BILL. HEY TORY LOANS WHICH EIGHTY FIVE THREE NINE WOULD HELP TO PUT AN END TO YOU ARE TARGETING AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS. AND OUR STORE IN OURS STRIPPING THE WEALTH FROM OUR COMMUNITIES. THESE PRODUCTS ARE ACTS ARE BEATING IN ALREADY SEVERE RACIAL WEALTH GAP THAT MY ORGANIZATION AND OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL ARE WORKING TO CLOSE. THESE ONE STOP SHOPS FOR PAYDAY CAR TITLE AND HIGH COSTS INSTALLMENT LOANS TEN OPEN STORAGE IN LOCATIONS WHERE HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO FAMILIES. THE DIFFERENT SHOWS UP EVEN WHEN RESEARCHERS FACTORED IN INCOME MEETING THAT THERE ARE MORE PAY THE STORES IN HIGH INCOME AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO NEIGHBORHOODS. THEM POOR WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS THEY ARE DELIBERATELY TARGETING BLACK AND BROWN. FAMILIES IN ADDITION. TO THIS COFFEE SHOP STORES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD PET TORY BENDERS ARE SPINNING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON MARKETING THROUGH THE RADIO ADS ON HIP HOP. RADIO STATIONS TV ADS ON SPANISH LANGUAGE CHANNELS AND DIRECT PHONE CALLS AND MAIL TO MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. DESPITE ADVANCES IN EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS OVER THE YEARS THE WEALTH GAP BETWEEN AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS HOUSEHOLDS AND WHITE HOUSEHOLD HAS PERSISTED. WHILE THE NETWORK OF WHITE. HOUSEHOLD IS AROUND A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND AND FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS IS AROUND. ELEVEN THOUSAND AND FOR HISPANICS IT IS UNDER. FOURTEEN THOUSAND EDITORIAL. THEN THE MAKES IT WORSE CAR TITLE LENDERS ALONE TRAINED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION FEES PER YEAR FROM CALIFORNIA. RESIDENTS CONSUMER LOANS THEY CARRY AN APR OF A 100% OR 2100% ARE NOT HELPFUL THEY ARE A TRAP IT IS FOR THOSE REASONS THAT WE SEND STRONG. SUPPORT EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY NINE THE URGE YOU TO STAND UP FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND VOTE YES ON AB. FIVE THIRTY NINE THE QUICKNESS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M AS WERE GARRET WITH OPPORTUNE MISSION DRIVEN CALIFORNIA LENDER WITH OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY STOREFRONT LOCATIONS IN NINE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE. OPPORTUNISTS CERTIFIED BY US TREASURIES A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OR SEDIA FIVE BECAUSE OF OUR MISSION WHICH IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING RESPONSIBLE IN AFFORDABLE ACCESS. TO CREDIT FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRADITIONALLY SHUT OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM FINANCIAL SYSTEM. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A CREDIT SCORE OR A MISS SCORED BY THE TRADITIONAL BUREAUS. NO ONE SERVES A HIGHER RISK BORROWERS AN OPPORTUNE. AND SO FAR WE SERVED OVER ONE MILLION CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. SAVING THEM NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN INTEREST IN FEES COMPARED TO PRODUCTS TYPICALLY AVAILABLE TO THEM. 90% OF ALL THE CUSTOMERS WE SERVE LIVE IN LOW TO MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE HELPED OVER HALF A MILLION CALIFORNIANS ESTABLISH THEIR FIRST CREDIT SCORE. OUR EXPERIENCES SERVING THIS COMMUNITY IS A REASON WE FEEL COMPELLED TO SUPPORT THE FAIR CREDIT ACT. AB FIVE THIRTY NINE BUT WE'RE JUST ONE OF MANY MANY LENDERS WHO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. COLLECTIVELY THE LENDERS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL OPERATE SEVERAL HUNDRED LOCATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. AND COLLECTIVELY WE SERVE SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS EVERY YEAR WHO ARE DEEMED TO BE TOO RISKY TO BE SERVED BY TRADITIONAL PROVIDERS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUBPRIME OR DEEP SUBPRIME CREDIT SCORES. SPEAKING PROPERTY AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT HAPPENED WERE FIRST TIME CUSTOMERS CAME TO US WITHOUT OF BY CO SCORED ALL. AND THE AVERAGE CREDIT SCORE FOR THE FIRST TIME BORROWERS WHO DO HAVE A SCORE IS SIX SO. EIGHT WITHIN THE MANY LENDERS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL YOU'LL FIND A DIVERSITY OF BUSINESS MODELS. BUT WE ALL AGREE ON THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLE. RIGOROUS UNDERWRITING FOR EVERY LOAN IN A DILIGENT APPROACH TO ASSESSING EVERY BORROWER'S ABILITY TO REPAY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO RESPONSIBLE LENDING. THE COMPROMISE PRICING FRAMEWORK IN THIS MEASURE WAS VIGOROUSLY NEGOTIATED OVER SEVERAL YEARS. AND WE BELIEVE IT STRIKES THE OPTIMAL BALANCE FOR ENABLING BOTH EXPANSIVE CREDIT ACCESS FOR CONSUMERS AND A FAIR RETURN FOR LENDERS. ACCORDING TO THE CBO. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT LENDERS MADE LOANS IN CALIFORNIA THAT I SHOULD CONFORM TO THE PRICING FRAMEWORK PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. COLLECTIVELY THE LENDERS IN OUR COALITION SERVE MOST OF THE FIFTY STATES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT OFFER THE FINAL THOUGHTS FROM THE NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE IN CLOSING. AS MMHM I MISS THE MOST STATED CALIFORNIA IS A NOTICEABLE OUT LIAR HERE AS THIRTY EIGHT OTHER STATES HAVE RATE CAPS IN PLACE FOR LOANS IN THIS RANGE. AND SECOND IF IMPLEMENTED THE RATE CAP PROPOSED IN AB FIVE THIRTY NINE WOULD BE ONE OF THE MOST FLEXIBLE IN THE U. S.. AND IS ABOVE THE MEDIAN RATE CAPS WHICH IS 25%. AND LASTLY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL I PASSED IT WILL ACTUALLY STABILIZE THE CALIFORNIA LANDING MARKET. AND ATTRACT OTHER RESPONSIBLE LENDERS WHO WERE WARY OF ENTERING HERE BECAUSE OF THE UNSETTLED UNCONSCIONABLE THE STANDARD WE BELIEVE IT COULD ACTUALLY LEAD TO MORE CONSUMER CHOICE FOR CALIFORNIANS. SO WHAT THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR VOTE IN FAVOR OF AB FIVE THIRTY NINE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THIS. COMING WITH THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WERE A PROUD SPONSR OF AB BY.

I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD MOST OF MY TIME -- TO TO OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO SHARE THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES THE AMOROUS ALAN MARIA BELLO SUMMER SO COULD YOU PLEASE START. THANK YOU FOR HEARING FROM ME TODAY -- MY NAME IS FIRST ALLEN I LIVE IN RANCHO CORDOVA -- I HAVE OVER TEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A SERVICE I'M CURRENTLY EMPLOYED. AS A PRO SERVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIVISION OF ADULT PRO OPERATIONS -- I CAME INTO A SITUATION WHERE I NEEDED -- TO GET ALONE IT WAS A FRIDAY THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT ON MY VEHICLE -- I WASN'T ABLE TO GET APPROVED FOR A TRADITIONAL LOAN THROUGH -- MY BANKING INSTITUTION I APPLIED -- TO THE LOWER INTEREST RATE COMPANIES -- I WAS DENIED -- BY UPON WHICH I HAVE A COPY THAT'S MY LITTLE I WAS ALSO DENIED BY ONE MAIN -- I TAKE THAT BACK I WAS APPROVED BECAUSE I WAS EXCITED BUT THEN I GOT A SECOND LETTER SAYING THAT IT WAS CONDITIONAL UPON A CAR TITLE LOAN -- WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE A VEHICLE TO PROVIDE AT THAT TIME AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS. VERY MISLEADING -- AND FORTUNATE. BECAUSE VERY EXCITED WHEN I DID GET APPROVED -- FOR AN ALL AN INSTALLMENT LOAN. IT WAS ADDED INCREASE RATE -- I DID REVIEW THE TERMS I LOOKED AT THE INTEREST RATE -- I WAS COMFORTABLE TAKING IT OUT BECAUSE I HAD NO INTENTION OF CARRYING TO TERM -- I HAVE AN EXCELLENT INCOME -- AND I KNEW I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY IT OFF IN THREE TO FOUR MONTHS WHICH I DID TWICE -- AT THE TIME I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GONNA DO I DON'T HAVE A VEHICLE TO GET TO WORK -- I'M A SINGLE PARENT I NEED TO PROVIDE FOR MY CHILDREN. BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR A LOAN ON A FRIDAY HOW THE MONEY ON SATURDAY -- AND THEN HAVE A VEHICLE TO GET TO WORK ON MONDAY ALLOWED ME TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NO YOU KNOW I HAVE A DECENT CREDIT SCORE I HAVE A STEADY JOB WITH EXCELLENT INCOME -- M COUNTER ALWAYS PAID ON TIME EVERY TIME THERE ARE GOOD STANDING -- I'VE HAD OTHER INSTALLMENT LOANS THAT I PAID OFF EARLY. AND I STILL DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR SOME OF THESE TRADITIONAL LOANS -- OR NONTRADITIONAL -- AND ONE MANSELL TONIGHT ME -- I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT PUTTING AN INTEREST CAP ON THE INSTALLMENT LOANS. IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE NEED FOR CREDIT FOR THE CONSUMERS UTILIZING THE SERVICE -- I AM A PRIME EXAMPLE THERE'S NO REASON WHY I SHOULD HAVE QUALIFIED AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT I COULD HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF MANAGING MY COUNTS BETTER FOR THAT'S FOR TO BE -- HIGHER AND TO BE ACCEPTED -- OR ISSUED A LOAN FOR OTHER -- AND IF THIS BILL PASSES. CONSTITUENTS THE LIKE MYSELF -- WILL BE FORCED TO SEEK OUT UNREGULATED LENDERS WITH NO CONSUMER PROTECTION -- AND I THINK THAT'S AN EVEN BIGGER ISSUE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ALTHOUGH THE INTEREST RATES ARE HIGH -- THEY ARE GOVERNED BY DVL SO THERE RE CONSUMER PROTECTION TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT I CAN COUGH I HAVEN'T YOU KNOW COMPLETE -- SO I WOULD JUST LIKE YOU. TO CONSIDER THESE THINGS AND MAKING A DECISION -- AND VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MY NAME IS MARIA BELLO -- I AM ALSO A RESIDENT OF THE FRENCH CORDOVA LAST AUGUST I WAS GIVEN A JOB OFFER WHERE -- CAN HAVE LIKE BETTER BENEFITS AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO I DECIDED TO START THAT NEW JOB. UNFORTUNATELY SINCE I WAS STARTING A NEW JOB I WAS PUT ON PROBATION FOR THREE MONTHS BEFORE I COULD RECEIVE ANY BENEFITS. AND I SOMEONE WHO IS DIABETIC I CANNOT JUST LIKE STOP MY MEDICATIONS SO. IT WAS EITHER. GET MY OWN INSURANCE PRIVATELY FOR THE THREE MONTHS THAT I'M ON PROBATION OR AND NOT HAVE ANY MEDICATIONS THAT TIME -- I REMEMBER RECEIVING MANY MANY EMAILS FROM -- ONE MAIL SAYING YOU KNOW JUST JUST HI IT'S JUST GONNA BE A SOFT INQUIRY JUST JUST GO FOR IT SO I SAID WHY NOT. I'M A READING NEEDED THE MONEY SO I DID THAT AND UNFORTUNATELY -- THE SAID THAT I WOULD ONLY BE APPROVED IF I CAN PUT IN -- A TITLE LOAN FOR CARP WHICH I DID NOT OWN AT THAT TIME. SO FOR ME IT WAS AN OPTION OF WHETHER JUST NOT HAVE. MEDICATIONS FOR THREE MONTHS OR SEEK OUT OTHER OPTIONS -- KNOWING THAT EACH TIME I APPLY FOR A LOAN THERE'S GONNA BE A HARD IN QUERY ON MY CREDIT AND IT'S GOING TO STAY THERE FOR TWO YEARS I CANNOT AFFORD. TO PUT MORE DAMAGING MY CREDIT SINCE -- AT THAT TIME IT WAS JUST THAT -- FIVE SIXTY ONE OF THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES THAT I HAVE -- I WAS USING TO MONITOR MY CREDIT -- PUT LOW -- GIVE ME A RECOMMENDATION AND I'LL ONE LENDER. I DID MY RESEARCH -- I FOUND GOOD REVIEWS ON THEM I DID MY CHIU DILIGENCE AND ON FINDING OTHER OPTIONS BUT AT THAT TIME THEY SOMEONE WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS ABLE TO HELP ME OUT. I WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS THE VERIFIED MY IDENTITY VERIFIED MY INCOME THEY MADE SURE THAT I AM ABLE TO PAY BACK WHAT I ATE I AM GOING TO BE TAKING OUT. THEY WERE VERY TRANSPARENT ON A WHAT -- THE WERE OFFERING THE TOLD ME EXACTLY HOW MUCH I NEED TO PAY AND WHEN I NEED TO PAY IT. SO THE DECISION TO TAKE THAT OUT. THAT'S ON ME I SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE TO PAY THAT BACK. BECAUSE THEY ALREADY TOLD ME WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S NOT LIKE TO BE THE HIT THIS INFORMATION FOR ME I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GETTING MYSELF INTO. SO IF I WAS NOT ABLE TO BE THAT BACK THAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I WAS THE ONE WHO MADE THAT DECISION THEY DID NOT TWIST MY ARM TO GET THIS LOAN. I WAS THE ONE WHO WALKED INTO IT. SINCE HAVING THAT LOAN MY CREDIT SCORE HAS WENT UP FROM -- FIVE SIXTY TO SIX FIFTY WHICH I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR BECAUSE THEY ARE REPORTING ALL OF THE ON TIME PAYMENTS THAT I HAVE BEEN MAKING AND I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET TO THAT SCORE HAD THE NOT. HELP ME OUT AND YOU KNOW. LOOK PAST THE NUMBERS THAT I HAD -- THEY HAVE ALWAYS SAKE -- HELP ME LIKE AB THEY THEY GIVE ME AYE NOTIFICATIONS ON WHEN MY PAYMENT SERGIO THEY'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN MAKING SURE I DID NOT. DEFAULT ON THIS LOAN THE BEING VERY RESPONSIBLE. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. WE DID NOT. GOAL FOR A HIGH INTEREST LOAN RIGHT AWAY. WE SEEK OUT THESE. LOWER OPTIONS YOU KNOW. THE FACT IS THAT. THEY HAVE EXISTED ALREADY THEY HAVE ALREADY PROVEN TOSS THAT THEY'RE NOT THERE TO HELP US. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THAT ROAD. AND WITH THIS BILL PASSING WE FEEL LIKE WHEN YOU'RE TAKING ONE OF OUR OPTIONS AWAY FROM US AND IT'S VERY CONCERNING -- SO WE WE WOULD LIKE -- TO PLEASE VOTE NO ON THE BILL BECAUSE WE WE NEED OUR OPTIONS OPEN AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THESE OTHER COMPANIES OR SAYING THAT THEY'RE GONNA STEP IN. THEY'RE NOT HERE TO HELP US THEY'VE ALREADY PROVEN THAT. THE CUTE. ADDITION WITNESSES OPPOSITION YES THANK YOU MARIA SUMMARY I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. YEAH IT WAS SAID THAT THIRTY EIGHT STATES. MY NAME IS MELISSA SOBRE WITH KERO FINANCIAL ME START THERE. THE COMMENT WAS THIRTY EIGHT STATES HAVE A SIMILAR RATE CAPS -- THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE WE LAND IN TWENTY TWO STATES WITH NEW INSTALLMENT PRODUCTS AT A TRIPLE DIGIT APR. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE OTHER STRAIGHT YOU MAY SEE AN INTEREST RATE CAPS BUT THAT'S NOT AN APR CAP THIS OTHER ALLOWABLE FEES AND CHARGES THAT MAKE IT THEREFORE VIABLE FOR US. TO TO LOAN TO SUBPRIME CONSUMERS -- IN THIS INSTALLMENT LOANS AUTO TITLE LOANS THEY'RE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES LIKE LIKE -- AUTO INSURANCE OR CAR LOANS. THE COSTS REFLECT THE RISKS. THESE LOWER COST LENDERS SUPPORTING THIS BILL ONE MAIN. LANDMARK OPPORTUNE THEY DON'T WANT TO THESE CONSUMERS TODAY BECAUSE IT'S NOT VIABLE TO DO SO -- WE HEARD SOME COMMENTS FROM OPPORTUNE AND AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF THE PILOT PROGRAM IN EXISTENCE WITH TWO REVISIONS TO THAT PILOT PROGRAM IS STILL LESS THAN 5% OF THE CONSUMER LENDING THAT'S HAPPENING IT'S A TERRIFIC PRODUCT. BUT IT DOESN'T SERVE VERY MANY CONSUMERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE MORE THAN THIRTEEN MILLION CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA WITH A SUBPRIME CREDIT SCORE OR NO CREDIT SCORE AT ALL. THERE ARE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CONSUMERS LIKE NERISSA IN MARIA. THAT ORIGINATE THESE LOANS EACH AND EVERY YEAR. COM WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ANCILLARY PRODUCTS OF SOME LENDERS DO DO THIS -- TO INCREASE A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR PROFIT MARGIN SO THAT THEY CAN SLIGHTLY EXPAND THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS THAT THEY CAN SERVE AGAIN. IT'S AN ECONOMIC MODEL. A BY VOTING TODAY FOR FIVE THIRTY NINE YOU'RE MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO GETS ACCESS TO STATE REGULATED CREDIT. BECAUSE MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT ON THESE OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CONSUMERS BY AND LARGE THE CHOICES THAT ARE GOING TO BE LEFT WITH. HIS TRIBAL LANDING AT HIGHER RATES. PREPAYMENT PENALTIES IN OTHER ISSUES THAT MIGHT COME ALONG. OR OFF SHORE ILLEGAL LENDERS. WHAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THAT LOAN VOLUME IT'S GOING TO BE OFF THE GRID IT'S NOT GOING TO SHOW UP ON THE CFO ANNUAL REPORT THAT'S ISSUED BY THE DB OUT? SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL. WE'VE TRIED TO PROPOSE ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO BROADEN THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS THAT WILL STILL BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO STATE REGULATED CREDIT BUT NONE OF THOSE. NONE OF THOSE OPTIONS -- WERE ACCEPTED -- I'VE HEARD ALSO THAT FOR OVER NINE MONTHS WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY ENGAGEMENT WITH US TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CONTINUED CREDIT AVAILABLE FOR CONSUMERS LIKE MARIA AND MARISSA. SO IN YOU'VE HEARD FROM THOUSANDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS EITHER BY LETTER OR BY. PHONE CALLS TO LETTING THEM KNOW LETTING YOU KNOW ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS ON THIS BILL SO I REALLY EMPLOYEE THIS POLICY COMMITTEE TO WEIGH THE OUTCOMES OF FIVE THIRTY NINE VERY CAREFULLY.

ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SHEENA AND BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FOR THE COMMITTEE. MAN BY SIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH WITH YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE MY VOICE -- YOU KNOW I'VE STRUGGLED WITH THIS ISSUE AND AND I KNOW THAT MANY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS COMMITTEE HAVE. ALSO STRUGGLED AND YOU KNOW ON ONE HAND THE FREE MARKET HAS BLESSED US WITH WITH A LOT AND TO AND THAT INCLUDES WAYS. OF FOR US ACCESS CAPITAL WHEN WE NEEDED BUT I TELL YOU WHEN I'M NOT I'M IN THE DISTRICT AND I'M TALKING. TO OF FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT. YOU KNOW THEY SAID LOOK COST LIVING YEARS AGO IT IS EXTREMELY HIGH RENTS ARE HIGH GAS PRICES ARE HIGH. YOU KNOW THINGS IN GENERAL ARE EXPENSIVE AND IT'S OFTEN HARD TO TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND IT REALLY CAN BE A STRUGGLE PEOPLE DO NEED A NEED A MECHANISM TO TO MAKE THINGS MEET BUT AS A WE DON'T HAVE AN UNFETTERED MARKET HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE HAVE SOME RULES TO PROTECT. PEOPLE AND AS I GO BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE I GOTTA TELL YA I WENT THROUGH A WAITED THROUGH A TON OF INFORMATION. AND ULTIMATELY WHAT PUSHED ME WAS -- AND WHAT CONVINCED ME WAS THAT -- I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A MORAL ISSUE. AND I ASK MYSELF IS A 2100% INTEREST LOAN MORALLY SOUND -- ONE MY CONSTITUENTS STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. TO ME THE ANSWER IS NO. AND I'M NOT GONNA PUT THEM UNDER THE WEIGHT OF INCREDIBLE DEBT. THAT IS NOT PAID OFF COULD DESTROY THEIR LIVES. THE CHALLENGES WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONABLE PEOPLE WHO CAN DISAGREE ABOUT WHERE THAT IS I'VE HEARD. YOU KNOW 100% SOME SAY 10%. AND I THINK AFTER CONSIDERABLE YOU KNOW I THOUGHT -- I THINK YOU MADE THE BEST EFFORT TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE. SO DESPITE THE BILL'S MERITS -- THIS IS GONE THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG CHANGE IN THE MARKET AND CURRENTLY THE BILL IS LIMITED. TO SHORT TERM LOANS RANGING FROM TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND NINE AND THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF LOANS ON THE MARKET. SO I COULD SEE A DESIRE BY SOME TO WANT TO EXPAND THIS TO OTHER TYPES AND SIZES OF LOANS AND I AM GOING TO JUST PUT IT OUT THERE I'M GOING TO BE. THAT. WE DO NEED TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY SO WOULD YOU COMMIT TO KEEPING THIS BILL CONTAINED. TO THE TO FOCUS ON LOANS THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY YES THIS BILL IS THIS BILL IS REALLY FOCUSED ON SMALL DOLLAR LANDING I THINK AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT LAST YEAR. I WAS CARRYING MULTIPLE BILLS IN DIFFERENT SPACES -- THAT WERE OUT NOT JUST IN THE SMALL DOLLAR INTENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE IF I WANTED TO INCLUDE PAYDAY OR OTHERS I THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN -- IN THERE AND SO THIS IS WHAT IT IS I ALSO THINK THAT -- IN LIGHT OF ALL YOU KNOW THIS IS A BIG BILL I THINK EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON HERE HAS SPENT LOTS OF HOURS AND TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS BILL -- I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE EVIDENCE TO BACK UP SOME OF THE CLAIMS THAT ARE BEING MADE GOODNESS GRACIOUS I KNOW THAT I'VE HEARD CLAIMS THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM -- I I DON'T FEEL THAT. AS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL THAT WE'VE PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT WE ARE GOING WITH THIS BILL ANYWHERE ELSE CERTAINLY ANYONE WHO HAS FOLLOWED MY TRACK RECORD KNOWS THAT THE OVERALL SPACE OF SMALL DOLLAR LENDING IS A SPACE WHERE I DO WORK -- AND I DO WORK IN DIFFERENT AREAS THIS BILL FIVE THIRTY NINE IS 250-021-0000. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. HI CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY DESERVES OUR ATTENTION -- I HAVE WORKED IN THIS AREA FOR MANY YEARS TRYING TO PROVIDE -- PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE ACT -- ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION TO FIND A LOT OF THESE PRO PROGRAMS LIKE LIKE LISK AND AND AXION THAT THAT. WORK TO TRY. TO BRIDGE THAT GAP TO MAKE -- LOANS MARKS BUT ACCESSIBLE BUSINESS. NO WE WE KNOW THAT IN OUR STATE ONLY 10% OF THE BUSINESSES OF THAT LOOK FOR LOANS ACTUALLY GET FUNDED YOU OFF THOUGH. PRACTICALLY NOT NEED A LOAN TO GET A LOAN IN THE STATE AND THAT SET SOMETHING IS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. AS YOU KNOW I ALSO WORKED ON A BILL TO PROVIDE -- CONSUMER. PROTECTIONS ON THIS BILL WITHOUT ELIMINATING ACCESS BUT AT LEAST -- FOCUSING ON ENSURE ENSURING PEOPLE KNOW WHAT KIND OF DEALS ARE GETTING IN TO MAKE SURE THIS FULL DISCLOSURE MAKE SURE. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO PULL OUT OF A BAD TRANSACTION FEW DAYS AFTER. THEY'VE ENTERED INTO AN IN CASE THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND THERE WERE ALL THESE THINGS IN THIS BILL AND THAT THIS. HERE IN THE SENATE LEAST -- THAT THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL DIDN'T DON'T WANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS A ONE ELIMINATE. THAT THE HIGH INTEREST RATE LOAN AND AND THE FOR THE TRUTH IS CURRENTLY. WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE THAT ARE CAPPED LIKE -- THE ONE THAT OPPORTUNE LENDS AN THAT'S SUBJECT TO A THIRTY SPURS 6% INTEREST RATE. AND AND AND REPORT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WAS PUBLISHED -- THROUGH OUR OUR SEEM VERY OFTEN -- OUR BIZ ARE [inaudible] OUR OF DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. 57% OF THE PEOPLE THAT APPLY TO THAT PROGRAM EVEN WITH A CAP OR DENY. SO WHAT ARE THOSE PEOPLE GOING TO GO -- IF IF THIS. IF YOU IF YOUR BILL PASSES WERE THOSE PEOPLE GOING TO GO. THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO THE BLACK MARKET THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THEY'RE GOING TO GO -- TO LENDERS THAT ARE NOT REGULATED THAT. YOU KNOW GROWING UP. I THE IT WE USED TO HAVE LOAN SHARKS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD THAT. THAT THAT HURT PEOPLE IF THEY DIDN'T PAY. AND WHEN SOMEBODY IS DESPERATE. WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GO FOR HELP? I I DON'T LIKE I INTEREST RATE LOANS I PREFER WE AS A STATE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TRYING. TO OF OF BRIDGE THAT GAP THAT'S WHY SUPPORTERS STATE BANK STATE BANK COULD BE MORE AGGRESSIVE. IN IN IN -- HELPING PEOPLE GET BANK TO HELPING PEOPLE. GET A CREDIT RATING -- YOU KNOW BUT WHEN I WHEN I GET LETTERS FROM MY CONSTITUENTS BY IT THAT THEIR POURING INSANE. I'VE USED THIS PROGRAM THIS IS HAS HELPED ME. A LOT THIS BILL WOULD BASICALLY LE ELIMINATE MY ACCESS TO GET -- LOANS. IT FIRST THINGS THAT WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING ME -- SOLVE A PROBLEM. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TO TO IGNORE PEOPLE THAT USE THESE LOANS THAT NEED THEM -- AND AND AND LISTEN THEM SAY WE NEED THIS IF YOU TAKE THIS WAY WE HAVE NOTHING. AND AND AND AND USUALLY THE PEOPLE THAT ADVOCATE FOR THE ELIMINATION OF OF THIS PROGRAM ARE THE ONES THAT DON'T USE PROGRAM AND THAT'S THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN TRUE. WHEN WE HAVE THESE KIND OF OF OF BILLS COME FORWARD? AND AND YOU KNOW OF TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO MANAGE YOUR FINANCES I DON'T THINK IT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO DO THAT I THINK WE SHOULD HELP THEM. EN EN -- EDUCATING THEM PROVIDING THE MEDICATION. FOR PROVIDING THEM ACCESS TO BETTER PROGRAMS -- BUT I I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING NONE THE LESS AND I WOULD HOPE THAT -- WE WE PUT IN STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. OF THAT WOULD BE OF OF A FAR BETTER APPROACH TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE ARE. OUR BANKED AND AND BUT ANYWAY THANK YOU MISTER SHARON AND THANK YOU WHEN IT. FOR FOR WORKING FOR COMMENTS CENTER GALLERY WORK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I SUPPORT YOUR BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THAT I GOT ON THE BANKING COMMITTEE AND I LEARNED A LOT MORE ABOUT BANKING THEN I THOUGHT I KNEW. I WANT TO SHARE STORY WITH YOU I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT. CUTTING IT ALONE. EARLY IN MY LIFE. AND BUT I KNEW BETTER THAN -- 2% OR HIGHER LOANS I COULDN'T GET ALONE I WENT TO THE BANK AND TRY TO START A BUSINESS. AND SO I'VE BEEN THERE WHERE THEY'RE AT AND I ACTUALLY WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND A PRIVATE. PERSON THAT WOULD LOAN ME MONEY TAKE A RISK ON ME. AND IT PROVED OUT GOOD AND I HAVE A GREAT CREDIT RATING NOW. BECAUSE SOMEBODY TOK A RISK ON ME SO I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE QUESTIONS AYE AYE. I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE GOING I AM VERY ADAMANT AGAINST SOMEBODY BEING PREYED UPON BECAUSE OF THEIR SITUATION. I THINK THAT'S WRONG. BUT ALSO THERE'S RISK THERE'S RISK INVOLVED IN. WAS WHAT WE HAVE A CREDIT SCORES BECAUSE THERE'S RISK. AND THE HIGHER THE RISKS THE MORE. YOU HAVE TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE FAILURES WHEN YOU DO THAT SO II WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT HOW WE GET A GAUGE AND HOW WE GONNA. HOW WE GONNA LOOK FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT DON'T THAT THE? SENATOR HUESO WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW WE GONNA FIND OUT IF WE LOSE HIM AND IS THERE SOME WAY WE CAN TRACK OR TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF WE LOST IN THE AFTER THIS BILL. BECOMES LAW BECAUSE FOR ME IF THEY WE REALLY DO EXCLUDE THOSE HIGH RISK PEOPLE NOBODY WILL TAKE A RISK ON A MAYBE THEY'LL BE LIKE ME AND I WOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. I WANT YOU TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THAT THAT TO ME IS A CRITICAL PART OF THIS -- HOW WE GO FORWARD I I I BELIEVE YOUR BILL IS GOING TO BE? SIGNED A LAW. BUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT IT'S DOES THAT MEAN IT'S PERFECT -- RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT WE NEED TO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. THE PEOPLE THAT. ARE IN THOSE SITUATIONS I WANT I WANT YOU TO TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S AN AND ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE THE ADD ON PRODUCTS THE INSURANCE. THOSE ARE THOSE TO ME ARE -- THEIR WAYS AROUND. GETTING WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO GO TO TO UP THAT LIMIT AND SO -- AND THEY ALSO USE THOSE AS TOOLS TO GAME THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS WELL EDUCATED OR OR OR IN THAT POSITION WHERE THEY JUST HAVE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT DAY AND SO I WANT YOU. TO ADDRESS THOSE COUPLE THINGS FOR ME. AND I I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND CERTAINLY THE BILL YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A COMPROMISE. THE BILL THAT IS IN FRONT OF YOU IS NOT PERFECT -- AND KNOW WHERE WE WENT WE SAW THAT THERE WAS THREE SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT. ONE THAT THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE ELIMINATED ALTOGETHER WHICH IS NOT THE BILL YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU -- OTHERS THAT DID NOT FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE REGULATED WHATSOEVER IN TERMS OF THE RATE. AND THEN THIRD THAT THEY FELT THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE AND THERE'S NOT. A MAGIC NUMBER BUT THE WAY WE GOT 236% PLUS FEES PLUS ANCILLARY PRODUCTS HE IS BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT WHERE. THE DEFAULT RATES WERE AT SINGLE DIGITS THERE WILL STILL BE PEOPLE. WHO WILL DEFAULT? BUT WE WANTED TO REDUCE IT FROM AS THE AS IT WAS STATED IN THE ANALYSIS FROM THE NEARLY 40%. THAT GO INTO COLLECTIONS TO A SINGLE DIGIT. WE ALSO LOOKED AT WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE COUNTRY WE KNOW THAT LANDING ACT FOR THEIR HAY HAD BEEN TRIED AND TESTED WE KNOW THE OTHER STATES -- I DON'T KNOW THAT EVEN IF WE SPENT THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION TODAY THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THIS MAGIC NUMBER THAT WOULD SOMEHOW BRING A COALITION TOGETHER -- BIGGER THAN WHAT WE SEE HERE TODAY I THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE LOTS OF DEBATE WE NEVER CREATED THIS PRODUCT. OR THIS BILL WITH THE INTENT OF HELPING ONE COMPANY OVER THE OTHER WE DID A IN THINKING OF THE CONSUMERS THE TWO STORIES THAT WE HAVE -- IN FRONT OF US FROM IBM MONEY SAYS -- IN A A BELIEVE I GOT YOUR NAMES CORRECT BUT MY YEAH MONEY SACK. ARE IMPORTANT STORIES TO CONSIDER THIS BILL DOES NT SOLVE FOR THE CONTINUED NEED AT HISTORICAL NEED THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE MUST DO MORE. MUST DO MORE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE UNDER REPRESENTED FOR THE LOW INCOME AND FOR THE WORKING CLASS WE APPROACH THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT. IF WE REALLY WANT TO DEAL WITH WHAT I HEAR. ARE EMERGENCIES. EMERGENCY THAT WORKING CLASS AND PEOPLE WHO ALSO WHO COME FROM LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS HAVE. THIS IS NOT THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION. THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION IS FINDING WAYS TO GET PEOPLE A GOOD JOB. GOOD SALARY PAY MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING INTO POVERTY THAT IS THE SOLUTION AND WE MUST INVEST MORE THIS. IS DEALING WITH THE FACT THAT ALMOST 40% OF THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE OUT THIS PRODUCTS DON'T HAVE THE STORIES. THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE THE STORIES. THAT WE HEAR MONEY SEND MONEY AT THE TALK ABOUT AND THAT'S A PROFIT THAT'S A PROBLEM. CREDIT CARD FOR EXAMPLES THEIR RATE OF DEFAULT IS 4% I'M SORRY THEIR RATE DEFAULT YES IS 4%. AND THIS IS NEARLY TEN TIMES THAT SO WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT WE STILL ARE OPEN I AS A MEMBER CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH ALSO TRADITIONAL FORMS OF BANKING AND NONTRADITIONAL FORMS A BANKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN A SINGLE ILL. IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS THIS IS REALLY ADDRESSING THE ALMOST 40% THAT DON'T HAVE THE STREET GOOD STORIES THAT COME OUT THAT LOSE THEIR CAR THEY GO INTO A DRUG DEBT CYCLE THAT GO INTO REALLY. A WORSE SITUATION THAN WHEN THEY STARTED -- YOU I WANT YOU TO ME FOCUS A LITTLE BIT. THEY BOTH HAVE JOBS [inaudible] N.. SO I I WANT TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE GONNA BE PRICED OUT OF THIS WHERE THEY CAN'T GET IN THIS MARKET BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA THERE'S A CAP ON THERE'S A HIGH RISK WHAT. WHAT WERE THEY GO? SO IF I MAY UM THE SENATOR DOLLY YOU AND I BOTH HAVE MADE MANY VOTES ON LEGISLATION THAT WAS A PERFECT. AND SO THERE ARE ANSWERS THAT WE WERE THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE DON'T HAVE FULL COMPLETE ANSWERS TO WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS CONSUMER PROTECTION AS SENATOR HUESO WAS -- POINTING OUT IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK TOWARD. AS FAR AS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE A PRODUCT FOR WHICH THE CONSUMER IS SAFE TO USE. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE -- FOR THE FOR THE ROOM WITH THE REASONS THAT OPPOSITION WOULD HAVE THE BELIEVE THAT -- ACCESS WOULD GO AWAY. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE -- AS MANY OR MORE REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT -- ACCESS WILL BE GREATER AND THAT MORE -- MORE LENDERS WILL FIND CALIFORNIA -- AS A AS A PLACE THAT THEY CAN ENTER INTO THE MARKET NOW. AND THEY CAN START LENDING -- I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING AND WILL ANSWER THE QUESTION -- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU BROUGHT UP INSURANCE AND ANCILLARY PRODUCTS? AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ANCILLARY PRODUCTS ON A SMALL ALONE UNDER THIS BILL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL ONE TO TEN DOLLARS A MONTH. IN COMPARISON TO A LOAN OF A AND THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATE THAT THEY'RE PAYING ONE TO TEN DOLLARS A MONTH DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE OR DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST THAT'S BEING PAID BACK. AND AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED 40% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO PAY THAT BACK END UP IN COLLECTIONS AND ACTUALLY END UP. IN A MUCH WORSE SITUATION THAN WHAT THEY STARTED OUT WITH IN THE NEED FOR THE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE. I GOT INTO THIS BECAUSE AS THE SENATOR ALREADY MENTIONED IT IS A MORAL ISSUE. AND THE MORAL ISSUE IS DO WE PROTECT OUR FOLKS ARE IN CALIFORNIA. AND DO WE WORK AND THIS IS A PIECE OF THE WORK. THE GREATER WORK THE CALIFORNIA MUST DO THIS IS JUST A PIECE OF AND IT'S NOT THE PANACEA DOESN'T FIX EVERYTHING. AND WE WOULD LOVE TO THE IF WE HAD THE RECIPE TO DO THAT WE JUMP IN AND FIX EVERYTHING. BUT THIS IS A START IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO HELP PEOPLE AND HELP CONSUMERS AND PROTECT THEM AND I'D I DO BELIEVE IF YOU WANT TO GET DEEPER IN THE WEEDS ON THE INSURANCE AN ABSOLUTE PRODUCTS. WE DO HAVE A WITNESS HERE THEY CAN -- ANSWER DEEPER QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND I WILL ADD THAT A MEMBER OF THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE IS ALSO BRINGING FORWARD SOME CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE NOT HAVING ABOUT THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY AND EMPLOYERS PARTNERING WITH US SO WE ARE SEEN A RISE. ON THE IN OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE MARKET THAT DON'T NEARLY HAVE THE RATES -- CLOSE TO WHAT WERE SEEN THAT ARE WORKING IN A YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES WITH THE EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES -- AND I THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD THAT BILL CONVERSATION AND CERTAINLY THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENING SO THERE ARE NEW MARKETS OPENING UP AS WE SPEAK -- RELATED TO THIS BUT THIS ISN'T GONNA SOLVE FOR ALL. MY LAST VOTE MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS THE ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE SENATE WE ACTUALLY GET TO HAVE SOME DEBATE HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WELCOME TO THE CONVERSATION. IT COST ME A LOT EASIER TO TO TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. THE MORE THE THE MORAL ISSUES THE MORAL ISSUE HERE. IS SOMEBODY PRAYED ON SOMEBODY'S DOWNTRODDEN THAT'S WRONG. BUT IT'S ALSO WRONG TO NOT TAKE A CHANCE THAT SEMI HELP TAKE SOME REST COULD TAKE A CHANCE ON SOMEBODY. WHO MAYBE HAVE A HIGH RISK SO MY QUESTION SO I JUST WANT TO ASK? FOR BECOME A SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. BUT I ALSO AM VERY NERVOUS ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE OUT THERE THAT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY TO BE THERE BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS GET TAKE THAT RISK ON A BECAUSE YOU'VE CAP THAT WRIST. SO WE SOMEWHERE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE WE GONNA FACT THIS IS THE GOOD SENATOR SAID AND AND A ARE WE REALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING. ARE YOU KNOW. WE MAY NOT BE MAYBE PUSHING A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THAT. DIDN'T REALLY DO ART AND THEN HAVE NO WAY TO REALLY BUILD THEIR SELF OUT OF IT SO THAT'S WHAT I WANT I I I WANT TO HELP FIGURE THAT OUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. BUT IT'S A VERY BIG CONCERN TO ME AND AND I SAID I I LOOK TO YOUR BILL THAT I LOOKED AT IT WHEN THE SIMPLY AS THE MORAL ISSUE THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE I DON'T THINK. IT'S RIGHT. TO FOR ANYBODY TO PREY ON ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE OF THEIR SITUATION. AND IT HAPPENS EVERYDAY UNFORTUNATELY. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAYBE MADE SOME BAD DECISIONS AND ARE TRYING TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND AND HAVE A ARE ARE DOWN AND OUT THIS TO ME WILL TKE A RISK ON HIM. AND THAT RISK IS VERY HIGH SOMETIMES SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT IF HOW ME THOSE WERE LOSING BY. TAKING THIS ACTION WE CAN BE PUSHING THOSE PEOPLE OUT. AND WE WOULD AGREE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL THE INFORMATION WE CRAFTED THIS BILL WE DID SO BY OOKING AT INFORMATION PRESENTED TO THE DB O. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT -- I A DO YOU KNOW IF. THERE'S A THINK. THE OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION BY FOLKS THAT DO TAKE A RISK ON MAKING THESE LOANS ON THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING IN -- WITH NO CREDIT AT ALL THAT'S A RISK AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING THEM. LOANS AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF IT ADDITIONALLY IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANCILLARY PRODUCTS I CAN. PROVIDE THAT IS WELL I CAN DO THAT NOW YOU TELL ME OKAY SENATOR ALSO [inaudible] ORDER WOMAN. YOU HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM OF A PART OF THE LOAN. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FIVE DOLLARS CHILDREN. HE DID NOT REALIZE A LOAN WITH AN ANNUAL EFFECTIVE. 38%. HE WAS OBLIGATED TO PAY FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. WELL OVER FIVE TIMES. THE AMOUNT OF HER ORIGINAL LOAN. YOU KNOW -- I'D LISTEN TO NOT ONLY THE TWO WITNESSES HERE TODAY. AND OTHERS I'VE OF SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE NOT ALL MY LIFE. IN OF LOW INCOME -- AROUND LOW INCOME FAMILIES FROM FARMWORKERS TO HOTEL WORKERS TO THE JANITORS AND WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. WHERE THEY'RE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF? OF ABOUT A WEEK AGO I WAS IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE. MEETING IN WHAT COMMITTEE HEARING WHERE. WE WERE DEBATING. WHETHER OR NOT TO PROVIDE PARKING LOTS FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS. AND EVERYONE WAS JUST AS UNCOMFORTABLE. VOTING FOR IT. AS THEY WERE. VOTING AGAINST IT OR STAYING OFF OF IT. BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO BE IN A POSITION. THIS ACT AS THE OF PROVIDING A PARKING LOT. WAS GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I MEAN THAT WAS. IT WAS A TERRIBLE SITUATION TO BE IN WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THIS TODAY. THE POVERTY IS THE REAL PROBLEM. POVERTY IS A REAL PROBLEM WE'RE JUST TRYING. TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO MAKE IT -- LESS [inaudible] PAINFUL. WHEN YOU LIVE IN AND THAT KIND OF POVERTY? AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT. SOME OF US ARE GRAPPLING WITH I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONCERN. THAT HAS BEEN -- EXPRESSED -- FOR FAMILIES NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL I I THINK THAT'S THE EVEN WORSE SITUATION. OF ALL. BUT TO PREY ON THEM WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THEIR ON ABLE TO PAY THOSE AMOUNTS. I THINK IT'S IT'S EVEN WORSE OF THE RISK IS HIGHER. BUT IMAGINE THE RISK WHEN THE PERCENTAGE RATE IS SO HIGH. WHAT HOW COULD THAT POSSIBLY MAKE IT AN EASIER RISK? WHEN THE LENGTH OF THE LOANS IS AN ISSUE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT MAKE THIS A RISK EVEN WORSE? FOR THOSE THAT ARE TAKING THAT OUT -- HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INTEREST RATES ARE BEING PAID PRIMARILY BY. PEOPLE OF COLOR. PRIMARILY BY PEOPLE OF COLOR SO [inaudible] I AM. I'M HERE TO YOU KNOW EXPRESS ALL THESE. BIG CONCERNS BUT SADDENED THAT. POOR PEOPLE ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IN ANOTHER WAY. AND THAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN SO MUCH ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES THEIR ALREADY POOR. THEY ALREADY HAVE THESE DISADVANTAGES AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE FURTHER ADVANTAGE IS EVEN WORSE. KIND OF REMINDS ME OF THE DEBATE OVER WHETHER SMUGGLERS WHO BRING. IMMIGRANTS ACROSS THE BORDER I DO ENOUGH GOOD [inaudible] OR NOT. MAYBE IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY WHO'S FACING DESPERATION IT'S A GOOD THING. THE CHARGING THEM. ENORMOUS ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY. TOTALLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THEM. SO THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN HERE NOW. AND I HOPE THAT AS THE LEGISLATURE. WE CAN DO FAR MORE ABOUT THE DESPERATION AND THE POVERTY THAT FAMILIES ARE ARE GOING THROUGH -- SOME. WE BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL -- AND I'M ALSO SPEAKING AS VICE CHAIR THE LATINO CAUCUS. THIS IS A PRIORITY BILL FOR THE LATINO CAUCUS SO. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK I HAVE JUST ONE QUESTION I THINK IT'S OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL -- TO ADDRESS THE THE ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED SEVERAL TIMES. ABOUT. HOW IS IT THAT YOU COULD CHARGE MUCH LESS [inaudible] AND STILL. BE IN BUSINESS. AND STILL PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND I WILL HAVE -- AS ROOM. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- FUNDAMENTALLY WE EACH HAVE. A DIFFERENT APPROACH WE HAVE A VERY DIVERSE SET OF BUSINESS MODELS THAT WE APPLIED TO THE LENDING THAT WE DO BUT AGAIN FUNDAMENTALLY WE BELIEVE THAT RIGOROUS UNDERWRITING UNDERSTANDING. NOT JUST A BORROWER SITUATION BUT AND THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY BUT WE ALSO LOOK AT A VERY DETAILED BUDGET ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH INCOME MATCHES UP WITH THE COMMITMENTS THEY HAVE MADE. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE FOR THE UNDERSERVED BORROWERS THAT CAN'T BE SERVED BY THE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IT REALLY COMES DOWN THOSE QUESTIONS -- THAT'S HOW WE LOOK BEYOND THE CREDIT SCORE AND FUNDAMENTALLY I'M WE CAN'T APPROVE EVERYONE BUT I THINK. IT LEAST WITHIN THE INSTALLMENT SPACE -- THE LENDERS THAT ARE OPPOSING THIS BILL ALSO CANCER EVERYONE THERE ALSO DECLINED BAR WAS TOO AND SO YOU LOOK AT THE UNIVERSE OF FOLKS WHO WOULD BEEN DISCUSSING TO GREAT LENGTH THE FOLKS IT WILL STILL NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AFTER THIS BILL COMES AND GOES. REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME -- THOSE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME FOLKS THAT WERE ALL DECLINING THAT NEED ADDITIONAL HELP -- SO THAT'S PROBABLY RESPONSIVE TO YOUR QUESTION HAPPEN TO ANSWER ANY OTHERS. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU. CAN RECOVER YOUR MATCH MISTER CHAIR -- LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT -- I PROBABLY SPENT MORE TIME ON THIS BILL. IN THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS THEN ON THE WORK ON MY OWN BILLS -- I'VE I'VE RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF LETTERS FOR THE BILL. AND I BREEZED RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF LETTERS ME WITHOUT BOXES IN OUR OFFICE AGAINST AGAINST IT. AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS MY BIGGEST ISSUE IS ACT ACCESS TO CAPITAL WHICH IS THE UNBANKED INDIVIDUALS WHICH ARE THE 57% OF THE PEOPLE THAT APPLY IN EVERY AND CAN GET CREDIT -- AND AND IT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW SOME OF IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LOW INCOME BUT SOME OF IT IS JUST -- THAT WE HAVE A VERY PERVERSE SYSTEM OF CREDIT IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M YOU GET NO CREDIT IF YOU HAVE MONEY IN THE BANK. YOU DON'T HAVE A FICUS CARE IF YOU HAVE MONEY IN THE BANK. AND AND SO FOR FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE USED TO IF YOU DON'T HAVE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD IT -- THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD CREDIT SCORES AND SO THESE EMERGENCIES THAT HAPPEN ON AT HAPPENED AT THE LEAST. AT THE LEAST CONVENIENT TIME AND SO WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE NO OR LOW FICUS COURTS WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO LOST THEIR HOME DURING THE MORTGAGE DOWNTURN -- AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THEMSELVES BACK ON THEIR FEET. WE HAVE -- PEOPLE THAT WERE UNINSURED AND A MEDICAL BILL -- A BABY BEING BORN IN THE FAMILY PUT SOME BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL. AND SO -- SO THAT'S BEEN PART OF PART OF WHY I'VE I'VE REALLY BEEN STUDYING THIS IS -- IS THAT WE DO HAVE A COMPLEX FRAMEWORK. RIGHT NOW WHERE WHERE IF YOU IF YOU CHANGE SOMETHING. IT HAS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES DOWN THE ROAD AND SO SO I WANNA TALK A LITTLE BIT I'M IN I'M IN A SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I I DON'T. I IT IS IT IS ONE SOLUTION. BUT I'M I'M I'M WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE -- THERE NEEDS TO BE MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS AND I EXPECT THAT WE'LL SEE OTHER BILLS COME THROUGH THAT PROVIDE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO TRY SOME DIFFERENT -- PILOT PROJECTS TAKING THE CAP OFF. NOT TAKING THE THAT THE TOP THE SUNSET DATE OFF THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW WOULD DO WHAT WE DO ONE THING THAT WOULD BE GOOD AND PROBABLY START TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR LENDING -- THAT THIS BILL BUT MOM PROVIDE -- BUT I BUT I WILL I'D WHAT I'D LIKE IS I LIKE THE INTEREST RATE CAPS. I LIKE THE NO PREPAYMENT PAYMENT PENALTY THE LENGTH OF THE LOAN IS REAL IMPORTANT THE THE ADMINISTRATIVE P.. FEES THAT ARE PART OF THE INTEREST RATE CAP BY I THINK WORKS REALLY WELL AND THEN THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE IN THE REPORT ON PAGE NINE AND TEN I I APPRECIATE YOU YOU TAKING THOSE. THOSE AMENDMENTS -- WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT AS AND I CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT ACCESS TO CREDIT? AND PARTICULARLY IN THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HAVE THE HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN THE BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THAT ARE. OPPOSED TO THE BILL BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT -- THAT THIS IS GOING TO HURT THEM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND AND WE HAVE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THAT REGARD -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE ANSEL THE ANCILLARY SERVICES -- THEY INCREASE THE COST OF LOANS -- LIKE CREDIT INSURANCE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PREPAYMENT PENALTY SERVICES SERVICE FEES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE INTEREST CHARGES I THINK ALL OF THOSE ARE ARE THINGS WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT IT. AND AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT REALLY -- ASSISTA CONSUMERS. TO TO MAKE GOOD CHOICES AND I AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT ONE OF THE RASONS THIS IS PARTICULARLY HARD FOR ME IS THAT. I'VE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE USED -- PAYDAY LENDERS PRETTY PRETTY REGULARLY. AND IT'S IT'S IT'S A PERSONAL CHOICE IT'S THEIR CHOICE AND THEY AND I'VE I'VE TRIED TO HELP THEM GET CREDIT AND TO DO -- THINGS AND AND FRANKLY THEY'RE ADULTS AND THEY IT'S YOU KNOW LET ME HANDLE MY OWN AFFAIRS AND AND THIS IS HOW I WANT. TO HOW I WANT TO ORGANIZE MY LIFE AND SO I RESPECT I REALLY RESPECT THAT IN AND RECOGNIZE THAT -- THAT. NOT EVERYBODY SEES THE WORLD THE SAME AND SO I WANNA -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WHATEVER WE DO IN THIS SPACE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WERE TRYING THAT WERE CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO GET LOANS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION AND THAT THAT THOSE LOANS ARE ARE -- IF THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE THE DECISION AND THAT -- THAT THEY IT'S IT'S THEIR CHOICE IT'S GOOD GOOD CONSUMER SEXO SO THERE WAS A PREDICTION. ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES SAID. WE WE BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE CONSUMER CHOICE WITH THIS AND I'M. THAT'S READ THE REASON I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT -- BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE AND I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING. CREATES A A DIVERSE REGULATED MARKET. BECAUSE JUST HAVING ONE OR TWO PROJECTS DOESN'T GET US TO THEIR TO THE TESTIMONY HERE TODAY WHICH IS THAT WE NEED. WE NEED -- WE NEED AS MANY OPTIONS AS POSSIBLE SO PEOPLE CAN CAN MAKE CHOICES. THOUGH. THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I LIVE I HAVE A QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M I'M I'M SUPPORTING IT TODAY I AM GONNA CONTINUE TO TO STUDY THE ISSUE AND TALK TO SOME OF THAT -- SOME OF THE OTHER OTHER -- PRODUCTS AND AND I EXPECT THAT WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THE WHOLE TOPIC THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD BE. PROPOSAL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] CENTER PORTANTINO. THE DOLLAR ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE SENATE EVERYBODY SPEAKS A START AT A LITTLE LIGHT NOW BUT I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE ALL. UP HERE AND WHY THIS ISSUE IS IS WHAT IT IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IS. IS BECAUSE IT HAS THOSE TWO SITES. YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF PREDATORS WHO. TAKE LOANS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T WHO SPEND. THEIR LIFE SAVINGS AND END UP. DEFAULTING. AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO NEED THAT [inaudible] LAST MINUTE. LOAN TO GET THROUGH THAT WEEK -- AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE. WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DRAW THAT LINE IS HOW DO YOU PROTECT THE CONSUMER. BUT ALSO PROVIDE A SPACE FOR THAT PERSON WHO DESPERATELY NEEDS THAT ONE TIME [inaudible] CASH -- I CAN'T TELL I MY OWN SINGLE MOM WHEN I WAS A KID WAS IN THAT SITUATION ONCE AND HAD. TO HAD TO GO TO A PLACE IN AND PAY AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT OF INTEREST BUT IT WAS A WEEK WHERE SHE NEED. TO AND SO -- I HAVE A FEELING OVER THE NEXT MONTH I'M GONNA BE. HEARING A LOT ABOUT THIS BILL. AS IT MOVES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE -- OBVIOUSLY I'M GONNA SUPPORTED TODAY -- BUT I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE STRUGGLE IS IS HOW DO WE PROTECT SOMEBODY. ON BOTH ENDS OF THIS CONVERSATION. AND I THINK THIS BILL IS A IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO TO DEAL WITH ONE HALF OF THAT CONVERSATION AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MARKET IS THERE TO PICK UP THE OTHER HALF OF THAT CONVERSATION SO I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING WITH THE AUTHORS. AS THIS BILL PROGRESSES OUT OF COMMITTEE AND I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE TODAY -- FOR ALL SIDES THANK YOU [inaudible] BOB. I DO HAVE A QUESTION TAKING ADVANTAGE AFFECTED THE BILL'S GOING TO PASS MAYBE. SOMETHING THAT I WORKED ON IN THE PAST OF THE ASKING YOU FEW WILLING TO ADD SOMETHING YOUR BILL. I I I RUN A BILL TO EXTEND THE PILOT PROGRAM I TRIED EXTENDED PERMANENTLY SINCE WE HAD ALREADY STUDIED AT AND THAT. WAS -- SHOT DOWN RECENTLY WITH ACCESS ACTUALLY INCREASED LIMIT BUT THIS WILL REALLY HELP. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS TO GET THAT PROGRAM MORE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THAT ARE. IN THIS CATEGORY IN WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO MEND YOUR BILL. TO TO UNDO THAT -- THE SUNSET ON THAT PROGRAM SO I JUST AT WE HAD A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM CENTER AT CHIANG ABOUT KEEPING MY BILL FOCUS TO WHERE IT IS AND I HAVE COMMITTED TO KEEPING MY BILL FOCUS TO WHERE IT IS. SO I WILL NOT BE ADDING ANY NEW PRODUCTS AND SO I THINK -- IT AS THE CONVERSATION GOES. THIS IS GOING THIS THIS IS NOT. THE END THIS CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE -- THAT AND I THINK THAT THE CONVERSATION RELATED TO THE PILOT PROGRAMS TO EMERGING MARKETS TO NEW MARKETS WILL. BE PART OF WHAT WE WILL ALL. YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY AS MEMBERS OF MAKING COMMITTEES CONTINUE TO TRY TO DIVE INTO THIS IS THERE WILL BE OTHER BILLS AT A NO NEXT YEAR -- BY DIFFERENT AUTHORS BY DIFFERENT FOLKS THAT WILL GENERATE THE CONVERSATION AND CERTAINLY THE PILOT PROGRAM HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PIECE -- AND I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROGRAM -- THIS BILL AS I'VE MADE THE COMMITMENT WILL STICK TO THIS PRODUCT IN THIS PRODUCT ONLY OCCUR PRITCHETT. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY COMMITTEE SEEN HEARNG. NINE I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD MY VOICE TO THE DISCUSSION AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES AND IT'S BEEN A DISPASSIONATE DISCUSSION WHERE WE ARE TODAY. BUT I FEEL WE'RE HERE TODAY NOT BECAUSE OF PREDATORY LENDING. I THINK WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THERE ARE THREE MILLION UNBANKED. CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE NOT BEING SERVED BY TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONS. AND IT'S BEEN A GROWTH OF THIS MARKET. AND IT'S BY NEED AND AND AND AND DESIRE THAT YOU KNOW CONSUMER DEMAND THAT SOMEONE HAD TO SERVICES PROP -- THE THE SPACE AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN SERVICING AT OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE NUMBER PEOPLE WHO ARE UNBANKED. BUT THE REALITY TO IF THOSE WHO ARE BANG. AND THEY NEEDED A LOAN TO DAY OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE THEY COULDN'T GET IT. THAT'S THE REALITY. THAT'S THE REALITY OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY SHOW I TOO AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ACCESS. TO CAPITAL I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. YOU KNOW -- ONE'S ABILITY -- TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN BUT I ALSO RESPECTFUL OF THE WORK THAT THE SIMPLY WOMAN A LOW MOAN ND A SOME WOMEN GRATION HAS DONE AND IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR CREDIBILITY. THAT I HAVE MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO PASS THE BILL BUT AGAIN AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES. THIS IS NOT THE PERFECT ANSWER IT'S FAR FROM IT. AND WHEN WE ONLY LOOK AT INTEREST RATES AS A WAY TO SOLVE. WORKING FOLKS NOT JUST POOR FOLKS PROBLEMS WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE THE BIG PICTURE BECAUSE IT'S MORE THAN INTEREST RATES THAT ARE BE. OF MALL TEAR IT'S AGAIN ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THE TO NEED THAT'S NOT BEING SERVICED BY. THE MEMBER AND WHATEVER ENTITY THAT USED TO PROVIDE IN THIS SPACE BUT ALSO WHEN WE LOOK AT FEES LET'S NOT LET'S LOOK AT IT IN THIS MARKET AS WELL WE LET'S LOOK AT MAKING FEES AS WELL. BECAUSE OF YOU BOUNCE A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR CHECK. BECAUSE YOU'RE TWO DOLLARS SHORT. YOU PAY THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR THAT TWO DOLLARS SHORTAGE. THAT'S FOUR DIGITS. SO LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL THE ENDS AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY WE HAVE A LITTLE HESITATION YEAR. THE DAY BUT WE KNOW THAT THE INTENTIONS ARE A WELL I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TWO AMENDMENTS THAT WE BROUGHT FORTH BECAUSE IF IT'S ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION CHAU WE SHOULD MAKE SURE CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED SO. I WILL STATE THE FIRST. OF A LOOSE BALL FOR A MOMENT -- THE MEMORY JUST FALLS IT WILL REQUIRE LENDERS. SUBJECT TO THIS BILL'S PROVISIONS TO REPORT BORROW PAYMENT PERFORMANCES TO ALL TOO WELL TO A MAJOR CREDIT BUREAU. NOT ENTERED OUR TALKED ALTERNATIVE I'M SORRY I CAN'T TALK TODAY CREDIT BUREAU. BUT A MAJOR CREDIT BUREAU. I WANT TO SEE SUCCESSFUL BARS REWARDED FOR THEIR EFFORTS WITH AN INCREASE. CAN THEIR CREDIT SCORES WHICH CREDIT CARD ISSUERS AND MORTGAGE COMPANIES LOOK FOR SO THAT'S OUR COMMITMENT THERE AS FAR AS REPORTING IT WILL REQUIRE LENDERS. SUBJECT TO THIS BILL'S PROVISION TO OFFER BORROWERS CREDIT EDUCATION BEFORE THEY DISPERSE ALONE PROCEEDS. AND REQUIRE THIS CREDIT EDUCATION TO COVER SERIES A CREDIT SCORE RELATED TOPICS. AGAIN WE KNOW THAT CREDIT EDUCATION IT'S PAST TASK TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH TIMELY AND RELEVANT INFORMATION. IF IS GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE IT CAN'T I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE TIMELY AND RELEVANT TO A BAR THAN TAKING OUT. ONE OF THESE LOANS THEN INFORMATION ABOUT THE VALUE OF CREDIT SCORE ITEMS AT IMPACT THEIR CREDIT SCORES AND HOW THE DISPUTE -- ITEM ON THEIR CREDIT REPORTS SO THOSE ARE IMPORTANT. SO YES WE'RE HERE TODAY AND AS WE'VE HEARD THERE ARE SOME OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ADDRESSED AND I WOULD JUST STATE BILLS. YOUR BILL DOESN'T A DOES -- DOES NOT PROHIBIT LENDERS FROM SELLING BARS. ANCILLARY PRODUCTS AS BEEN MENTIONED AS CONCERNED IT IS NOT REQUIRED THE COSTS OF THOSE ANCILLARY. ON INSURANCE TO FIT UNDER THE THIRTY EIGHT POINT FOUR CAP. ON AND WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF BORROWERS WHO WANT TO BORROW LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BECAUSE ALSO I'VE HAD PLENTY FOLKS WHO'VE COME INTO MY OFFICE. AND SAID I NEEDED A THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT BECAUSE OF THIS FOR START TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED I BORROW TWENTY FIVE ARGUED I'D MEASLY PAY BACK. THE FIFTEEN AND I KERRY THE BALANCE ON THE ONE THOUSAND WHAT LET'S LOOK AT WARNER FLOOR TO I MEAN BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE GREATEST. HOLE IS THAT'S WHERE THE MAJORITY OF BORROWS THEY NEED ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED MAJORITY OF OF COMING OF MY OFFICES I DON'T NEED TWENTY FIVE WHEN YOU BUT I TAKE IT IN ORDER. TO BECAUSE I CAN'T GET ANYTHING ELSE. ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT SPACES WHILE. I MEAN AND THAT'S THAT'S REAL AND AND AGAIN. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AGAIN TALKING TO ALL INSTITUTIONS OF LENDING AND GETTING EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE. BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE THREE MILLION PLUS CALIFORNIANS WITH NO ACCESS. TO TRADITIONAL BANKING OR CREDIT OR WHEN IT WORK WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE. NOW WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB ON AT ADDRESSING THOSE. REAL HARD REALITY SO. THAT'S WHERE I AM WITH THAT -- YOU ACCEPTED THE THOSE TWO MOMENTS THAT WE'VE DESCRIBED AND I HOPE YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT AGAIN -- AS HIS BOWL BILL MOST FOR THAT. THERE WILL NOT BE ANY ADDITIONAL ADD ONS THAT. HAVEN'T BEEN AGREED UPON ON THIS -- BY THIS COMMITTEE OF SO WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BRING IT BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE AND DEAL WITH IT ACCORDINGLY SO. THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING I THINK A REPEATED IT A FEW TIMES YEAH. I JUST I APPRECIATED BUT WE JUST LIKE TO BE CLEAR SO -- AGAIN -- OKAY I APPRECIATED SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. BOB BEFORE CLOSING STATEMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE JOINT AUTHORED ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOAN. I WANTED TO STATE JUST REITERATE ONCE MORE THAT -- THIS BILL WAS NEVER PROMOTED OR BROUGHT FORWARD AS THE FIX ALL TO THE TO THE LENDING ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING -- NATIONALLY AND AND ALSO IN OUR STATE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK WHAT WE FOR TODAY. OUR CONCERNS FROM SENATORS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT HAVE -- THAT EXPRESS YOUR CONCERNS IN SUCH A WAY THAT IS HOPE MANY OF US TO LEARN THAT THERE THOSE CONCERNS CAN TURN INTO GREAT IDEAS FOR ADDITIONAL BILLS. THAT -- TURN INTO A SERIES OF BILLS THAT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM HOLISTICALLY AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE WAS WE'VE PICKED A NICHE. AN AREA THAT WE CAN START WITH THAT OTHERS CAN LEARN HOW TO MOVE OTHER IDEAS THROUGH AND OTHER IDEAS FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- FOR IN PARTICULAR ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS. THAT -- REALLY I BELIEVE WILL BE VERY VERY HELPFUL AND UPWARD MOBILITY AND HELPING PEOPLE TO GRADUATE FROM SUB PRIME IT TO PRIME. AND YOU WE TALK ABOUT ACCESS ONE OF THE GREATEST AREAS OR WAYS TO CREATE ACCESS IS TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T CREATE A POOL OF SUBPRIME WHERE SOMEONE STAYS THERE. BUT THE IT BECOMES THE OPPORTUNITY IN A STEPPING STONE TO GO FROM SUB PRIME TO PRIME CREATING THAT OPEN SPOT FOR OTHERS TO MOVE IN SO WITH THAT AMENDMENT I THINK THAT'S PART OF ANOTHER -- ANSWER AND THE SOLUTION TO A BIGGER PROBLEM THAT ALL OF US WANT TO SEE EVENTUALLY RESOLVED THAT CAN'T BE DONE WITH ONE SINGLE BILL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND CLOSE EXT. THANK YOU AND I I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AT AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND ALL THE MEMBERS MANY OF YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU'VE NOT BEEN LOBBIED. ON A BILL AS MUCH AS THIS BILL -- AND YOU SAID WHETHER IT WAS YOUR OWN WITH YOUR TEN YEARS EXPERIENCE THIS BILL IS CERTAINLY MOVING THE NEEDLE AND IT'S HARD IT HAS EQUALLY BEEN HARD FOR ME AS THE AUTHOR -- IN THIS IS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE AND THE NO WAY ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WERE TAKING NEEDED TODAY THAT ARE ISSUES THAT WE CONTINUE TO NEED TO WORK ON THE EN BANC. ACCESS TO CAPITAL BOTH IN TRADITIONAL AND NONTRADITIONAL FORMS FINANCIAL LITERACY AXIS TOOK A BUILDING CREDIT -- THE EMERGING MARKETS ALL OF THOSE ARE PART OF A GREATER CONVERSATION THIS BILL FROM THE BEGINNING WAS ABOUT A RATE CAP. AND WE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WOULDN'T ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE BUT I HOPE THAT AS IN THESE THIS CONVERSATION HAS COME FORWARD AS EVERYONE. AND HAS IN IN SOMEWHERE OTHER EXPRESSED THAT THERE IS MORE TO DO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS IN THE COMING YEARS ABOUT WHAT WE DO TO ADDRESS THE OTHER ELEMENTS. THAT ARE PART OF A BIGGER CONVERSATION -- I THINK THAT THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR ME IT WAS NEVER ABOUT EIGHTEEN ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER IT WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE ADDRESS THE FACT THAT TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS LOSE THEIR CAR A YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS PRODUCT. THAT NEARLY 40% GO INTO COLLECTIONS BECAUSE OF THIS PRODUCT -- THAT IS WHERE WE TRIED TO GO WITH THIS BILL AND WE UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR US FOR THIS PERSPECTIVE WE NEEDED A RATE CAPS. GETTING TO THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT LOTS HAS BEEN PROPOSED -- AND SO I THINK WHEN I HEAR FOLKS THAT SAY WELL WE WERE INVITED TO THE TABLE EVERYBODY WAS INVITED TO THE TABLE BUT IT WAS A RATE CAPS BILL AND IF YOU WEREN'T WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT A RATE CAPS. THEN YOU'RE RIGHT PEOPLE CHOSE NOT TO BE AT THE TABLE -- THIS BILL WASN'T ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE AND I THINK. THE AMENDMENTS CONTINUED TO MOVE IT FORWARD IN A WAY THAT KEEPS THE INTEGRITY OF THE BILL -- INTACT -- AND SO I HOPE THAT WE WILL. LOOK AT WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND WE WHAT WE HIGH HOPE THAT WE WILL LOOK AT HOW WE CONTINUE TO SERVE THE MOST UNDERSERVED IN THE STATE -- I THINK YOU FOR ALL THE FOUGHT. ALL THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE ALL PUT INTO DELIBERATING THIS ISSUE IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY -- AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY I I JUST WANT CLAIFICATION WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH TITLE LOANS YEARS SO I'M JUST CURIOUS ON HOW -- BARS A BLASTER CARD USING THIS PRODUCT MOST OF THE TITLE LOANS ARE IT WITHIN THE TOP 250-021-0000 DOLLARS SPACE YEAH BUT OKAY. BUT WE WEREN'T DEALING WITH THOSE SO IT KIND OF MONIES TO WATER AND OUT TO A LOT OF FOLKS ARE CONFUSED ABOUT ALSO BECAUSE YEAH BUT ANYWAY [inaudible] OUR MA'AM SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
