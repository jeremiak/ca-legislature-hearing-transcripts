00:46:29.853 --> 00:46:31.355
AND THIS IS MY FIRST ORDER

00:46:31.421 --> 00:46:32.823
REQUEST MY FOUR PLUS YEARS.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.324
HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE.

00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:35.659
THE CONTEXT OF THIS AUDIT

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:36.994
REQUEST.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.328
IS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:39.396
CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING THE

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:41.765
MOST INTENSE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:43.167
INTERSTATES HISTORY AND THIS

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:45.302
PARTICULARLY IMPACTS STUDENTS.

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.837
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OVER A

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:48.138
QUARTER MILLION CHILDREN IN

00:46:48.205 --> 00:46:50.140
CALIFORNIA ARE HOMELESS THIS IS

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:51.842
A STUDENT HOMELESSNESS CRISIS

00:46:51.909 --> 00:46:52.743
DRIVEN BY A LACK OF AFFORDABLE

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:53.310
HOUSING.

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:55.112
SKYROCKETING INEQUALITY IN

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:56.747
EXTREMELY HIGH CHILD POVERTY

00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:57.681
RATES.

00:46:57.748 --> 00:46:59.816
THE CRUX OF THIS REQUEST IS

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.251
BASED ON TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.252
DATA COLLECTED BY LOCAL

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:04.521
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES COMPILED BY

00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:05.522
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:06.290
EDUCATION.

00:47:06.356 --> 00:47:08.192
WHICH SAYS THAT OVER A QUARTER

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:10.627
OF ALL CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ALMOST

00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:11.228
TWENTY SIX HUNDRED CALIFORNIA

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:13.030
SCHOOLS AND FOUR HUNDRED

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:16.066
DISTRICTS HAVE REPORTED EXACTLY

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:17.267
ZERO HOMELESS STUDENTS.

00:47:17.334 --> 00:47:18.735
THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE GIVEN

00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:19.903
THE HOMELESSNESS WE ARE ALL SEEN

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.538
IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE THINK IT'S

00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:22.706
HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT THERE ARE

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:24.007
EXACTLY ZERO HOMELESS STUDENTS

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:25.742
AND A QUARTER OF K. THROUGH

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:27.144
TWELVE SCHOOLS IN OUR STATE.

00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:28.278
THROUGH THIS AUDIT WE HOPE TO

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:29.813
UNDERSTAND WHY STUDENT

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:30.714
HOMELESSNESS IS GOING UNDER

REPORTED WHAT BARRIERS ARE

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:34.218

THE STUDENTS AND WAS BACK WHAT

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.721
BEST PRACTICES EXIST. FOR

00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:39.756
DISTRICTS IN PROVIDING THE

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:40.958
SUPPORT THE STUDENTS NAY.

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:42.025
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WELL AS

00:47:42.092 --> 00:47:43.493
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.062
UNDER FEDERAL STATE LAW TO

00:47:45.128 --> 00:47:46.363
IDENTIFY THE STUDENTS AND

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.864
PROVIDE THEM SERVICES.

00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:49.333
IF THEY'RE NOT BEING COUNTED

00:47:49.399 --> 00:47:50.367
THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE CRITICAL

00:47:50.434 --> 00:47:51.802
SERVICES THEY NEED FROM HEAD

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:53.837
START TO PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:56.406
TRANSPORTATION SERVICES SCHOOL

NUTRITION PROGRAMS ETCETERA.

00:47:58.141 --> 00:47:59.076
THE STUDENTS IN YOUR BASS THE

00:47:59.142 --> 00:48:01.845
DIFFERENCE AND THEY NEED

00:48:01.912 --> 00:48:03.347
SERVICES TO SUCCEED.

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:04.448
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT'S NOT

00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:06.416
GOING TO GO AWAY SIMPLY BECAUSE

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:07.851
WE IGNORE IT.

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:09.052

AT MY OLD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL --

00:48:35.012 --> 00:48:37.648
IN LOS ANGELES UNIFIED 24% OF

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:38.949

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:39.883
HOMELESS.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:42.052
UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU CAN SEE

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:44.821
FROM THIS MAP OF THIS IS A STATE

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:46.523

THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF

00:48:52.729 --> 00:48:55.098
CHILDREN THAT ARE ARE CLASSIFIED

00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:57.100
AS HOMELESS AT OUR SCHOOLS --

00:48:57.167 --> 00:48:58.969
I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:01.204
FIRST HAND AND HOW HOMELESSNESS

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:02.839
AFFECTS OUR CHILDREN.

00:49:02.906 --> 00:49:04.641
I FOUNDED A NON PROFIT THAT

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:06.410
WORKS WITH YOUNG GIRLS TO GET

00:49:06.476 --> 00:49:08.045
THEM INTERESTED IN STEM.

00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:09.513
AT ONE OF THE SCHOOLS IN MY

00:49:09.579 --> 00:49:12.783
DISTRICT STUDENTS WASN'T SHOWING

00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:14.518
UP TO OUR PROGRAM AND I ASSUME

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:16.119
THAT IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS AN

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:17.587
INTEREST IN STEM ANYMORE.

00:49:17.654 --> 00:49:20.257
BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS HOMELESS.

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:22.159
AND WASN'T THINKING ABOUT STEM

00:49:22.225 --> 00:49:24.394
SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHERE SHE

00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:25.829
WAS GOING TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:27.230
AND WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO EAT

00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:29.099
BECAUSE SHE WAS SLEEPING IN THE

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:30.801
CAR WITH HER MOM.

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:32.703
THIS IS SADLY SOMETHING CHILDREN

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:35.172
IN MY DISTRICT FACE EVERY DAY

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:36.506
AND UNFORTUNATELY CHILDREN

00:49:36.573 --> 00:49:39.776
STATEWIDE ARE ALSO FACING.

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:41.545
CALIFORNIA HAS OVER TWO HUNDRED

00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:42.079
THOUSAND HOMELESS SCHOOL

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:44.047

HOMELESS STUDENTS WERE FAILING

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:50.387
THESE CHILDREN.

00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:51.855
THE STATE NEEDS TO KNOW WHERE

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:54.257
OUR FAILURES ARE TAKING PLACE SO

00:49:54.324 --> 00:49:55.659

SCHOOLS WHICH REPORT LOW TO NO

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:22.986

00:50:31.995 --> 00:50:33.530

IN THE AREA THAT'S THERE.

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:54.284
I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE TO

CRITICAL TOOLS THAT WILL LEAD TO

00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:07.264
SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF

IMPLEMENT THIS LAW --

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.480
TYPICALLY IN THE PAST I BELIEVE

I DON'T WORK AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:53.116
I WORK MORE AT THE L. THE A

DISTRICTS.

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:59.422

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.724
DATA THAT WE RECEIVED WAS ABOUT

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:04.293

ELEAZAR THAT REPORTS WERE.

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:07.163
WERE IMPORTING ZERO HOMELESS

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.231
STUDENTS.

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:10.666

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:12.769
AS AS I REACH OUT TO THEM AND

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:15.338
GIVE THEM THEY PROFESSIONAL

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:15.905
DEVELOPMENT IN THE TECHNICAL

01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:18.274
SENSE.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:19.842
A LOT OF TIMES THEY REPORT BACK

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.978
AND SAY WELL WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:23.846
STUDENTS ON OUR TOTAL POPULATION

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:24.914
WE HAVE A LOT OF SCHOOL

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:26.249
DISTRICTS THAT ARE ONE SCHOOL

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:27.316
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:28.284
CHARTER SCHOOLS.

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.153
THAT REPORT THIS AND THEY KNOW

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:31.320
WHERE ALL THEIR HOMELESS STUDENT

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:32.455

CHILDREN OR STUDENTS ARE PERIOD

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:38.528
AND SO THAT IS THE PRIMARY THING

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:39.862
THAT WE DO.

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:41.330

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:44.634
REACHED OUT.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.803
TO EVERY DISTRICT WIDE --

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:48.271
DISTRICTS STATEWIDE SCHOOL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:58.481
LET ME START BY THANKING THE

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:02.118
REQUEST YEARS OF THIS ON IT --

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:05.855
IN MY AREA THE SALINAS SCHOOL

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:07.757
DISTRICT REPORTS OVER 30%

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.659
HOMELESS.

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:11.260
THE THRUST OF A LOT OF THIS ON

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:14.363
IT IS BETTER MONITORING BUT I

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:15.598
KNOW PART OF IT IS ALSO TO

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:19.368
IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES --

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:21.504
EITHER THE AUDITOR OR OR

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.506
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.708
I THINK THE DEFINITION OF

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.210
HOMELESSNESS IS IMPORTANT

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:29.445
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEAN KIDS ARE

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.680
NECESSARILY LIVING ON THE STREET

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:32.315
IN SALINAS THEY MIGHT BE.

ETCETERA.

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.389
COULD ONE OF YOU SHARE FOR THE

01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:42.692
COMMITTEE WHAT WHAT CONSTITUTES

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:46.062
HOMELESSNESS FOR SCHOOL STUDENT.

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:48.431

SITUATIONS THANK YOU AND I THINK

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:29.939
THAT'S HELPFUL TO SHOW.

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:31.374
THE SCOPE OF THIS --

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.143
WHEN WE HEAR 30% IN SALINAS THAT

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.946
JUST SOUNDS STAGGERING IN BUT

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:38.981
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE FACTORS

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:39.749
THAT?

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:42.318
THE CONSTANT HOMELESSNESS AND

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:43.753
THEN A QUESTION I THINK FOR THE

01:03:43.819 --> 01:03:45.154
FOR THE AUDITOR.

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:46.722
IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT BEST

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:48.291
PRACTICES IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:50.760
A SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE TO THIS

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:52.461
OF HOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:56.165
WORK WAS SOCIAL SERVICES TO TRY.

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:57.266
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:59.001
WITH THE FAMILY AND TO MOBILIZE

01:03:59.068 --> 01:04:00.136
SUPPORT.

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:00.670
RIGHT AND THEN THERE'S A

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.939
CLASSROOM SIDE OF HOW THIS HOW

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.408
HOMELESS STUDENT PRESENTS.

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:07.276
LEARNING CHALLENGES TEACHING

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:08.678
CHALLENGES IN THE CLASSROOM

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:11.080
WE'LL YEAR ON IT LOOK AT THOSE

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:13.616
DIFFERENT ARENAS SOME MAYBE

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.418
SHARE A LITTLE BIT HOW.

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:17.053
HOW THE ON IT?

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:19.188
DETERMINES BEST PRACTICES TO BE

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:20.089
SHARED -- AS

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:21.724
PART OF THIS ON IT.

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:23.459
I THINK BEST PRACTICES WOULD BE

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.262
IN THE EVENT WE WE SEE --

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:27.730
SITUATIONS WHERE.

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:29.799
A STABLE ELEAZAR HAVE IDENTIFIED

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:30.967
HOMELESS YOUTH AND HAVE BEEN

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.668
ABLE TO PARTNER WITH PROVIDERS

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:34.837
IN THE COMMUNITY TO GET SERVICES

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.439
TO THOSE CHILDREN AND CERTAINLY

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:38.040
LOOKING AT ANY NATIONAL.

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:39.208
STUDIES THAT ARE OUT THERE

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:40.676
RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS --

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:43.012
WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE INFORMATION

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.814
IN TWO DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.549
RELATED --

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:47.617
TO IDENTIFICATION OF HOMELESS

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.685
YOUTH BUT WORKING WITH PROVIDERS

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:51.220
AND THAT WOULD BE IN MY VIEW THE

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:53.089
SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE HOW ARE THE

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:54.857
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WORKING WITH IN

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:55.992
THE COMMUNITY.

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:59.061
WE CONDUCTED AN AUDIT LAST YEAR

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:00.696
LOOKED AT IT FROM THAT COMMUNITY

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:03.132
SIDE OF IDENTIFYING HOMELESS.

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:04.267
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA NOT JUST

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.068
USE UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH IN

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:06.902
PARTICULAR --

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:09.272
BUT THESE CONTINUUM OF CARE THAT

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:10.039
ARE OUT IN EACH OF THE

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:11.907
COMMUNITIES AND HOW THEY'RE

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:13.643
IDENTIFYING TYPES OF SERVICES TO

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:14.143
PROVIDE.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:16.345
A HOME TO HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:18.581
SO THE OBJECTIVE WHERE WE'RE

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.516
GOING TO SPECIFIC ELLIE ACE

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:21.817
GOING TO A CHARTER SCHOOL WE

01:05:21.884 --> 01:05:23.786
LOOK AT IT THERE AND THEN ALSO

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.121
IN THE OBJECTIVE --

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:26.422
THAT THE MEMBERS HAVE ASKED US

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:27.757
TO LOOK AT TRENDS AND OR BEST

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:29.492
PRACTICES WE WILL ALSO BE

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:31.494
LOOKING AT THE SOCIAL SERVICES

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.829
SIDE AND LIAISONS AND YOU KNOW

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:35.731
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WORKING

01:05:35.798 --> 01:05:36.799
WITH --

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:38.601
COMMUNITY NOW PROVIDERS THANK

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:42.038
YOU AND IF I MIGHT MISTER CHAIR

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:42.772
JUST KIND OF A FINAL COMMENT

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:43.072
[inaudible]

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.874
OR QUESTION.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.042
MY GUESS IS THERE'S SOME OVERLAP

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.277
WITH TRUANCY FIGURES --

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:49.845
ARE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:51.947
KAMALA HARRIS --

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:55.017
WE HAD A NUMBER OF BILLS TRYING

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.586
TO DECRIMINALIZE TRUANCY AND

01:05:57.653 --> 01:05:59.655
REALLY FOCUS ON FAMILY DYNAMICS

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:02.158
SCHOOL DYNAMICS AND SUPPORTING

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:04.360
STUDENTS WERE THERE WAS CHRONIC.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.228
TRUANCY --

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:07.596
UNFORTUNATELY OUR FORMER

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:08.864
ATTORNEY GENERAL SPACE I THINK

01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:10.900
SOME MISINFORMATION IN THE MEDIA

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:12.535
SUGGESTING THAT SHE SOUGHT TO

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:14.337
CRIMINALIZE TRUANCY WHEN IN FACT

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:15.905
IT WAS JUST THE OPPOSITE.

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:18.641
WE WORK TO TO UNDERSTAND BUT I

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.009
WOULD THINK THERE'S GONNA BE

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.477
SOME OVERLAP.

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:23.412
IN.

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.014
STUDENT HOMELESSNESS.

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:27.416
ENTRANCE HE TRANS AND IF THAT'S

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.819
AN APPROPRIATE --

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:32.488
TO ADD TO YEAR INDICATORS I

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:33.856
THINK THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL.

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:35.958
ALSO FOR FOLLOW UP FOR SCHOOL

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:37.927
DISTRICTS. TO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:41.964
BEHIND THAT STUDENT.

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:44.033
IF WE FIND HOMELESSNESS HAD WE

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.001
MOBILIZE SUPPORT RIGHT AT AND

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:46.836
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:47.937
SENATOR --

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:49.171
THAT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT

01:06:49.238 --> 01:06:50.406
WILL WILL TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:51.741
ABOUT AND AND ABSOLUTELY TAKE

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:53.075
INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE I

01:06:53.142 --> 01:06:55.845
THINK YOUR OBSERVATION IS.

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:57.513
A 100% CORRECT.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.080
OR WE JUST FOLLOWED DOES THE

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:58.881
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:00.449
THOSE NUMBERS FOR SCHOOL

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:01.884
DISTRICTS ARE REPORT ZERO

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:03.119
HOMELESS STUDENTS BUT HIGH

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:04.153
TRUANCY RATES.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.688
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU GUYS CAN

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:08.290
PROVIDER.

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:08.891
MAYBE HELP ASSIST THE AUDITOR

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:11.427
WITH.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:12.862
OTHER AT LEAST GO I JUST MAKE

01:07:12.928 --> 01:07:14.263
ONE MORE COMMENT TO DOVETAIL.

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:16.232
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO LOOK AT

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:18.300
DIFFERENT AND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:19.602
TAP IN AND HELP THE STUDENTS FOR

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.971
EXAMPLE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO

01:07:22.037 --> 01:07:23.939
HAD RECEIVED A FEDERAL GROUND

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:24.907
GRANT OUTSIDE OF THE MCKINNEY

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:25.975
VENTO GRANT.

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.676
OF EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:29.445
WHICH A MINIMUM OF ONE POINT

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:31.680
FIVE MILLION IS TARGETED AT

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:34.917
EDUCATION AGENCIES. FOR HOMELESS

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:36.752
YOUTH AT RISK USE AND IT'S

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:39.622
IMPORTANT TO ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:40.222
TO ARM.

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:41.357
IT YOU KNOW MAKE THESE

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:44.026
NONSTANDARD PARK PARTNERSHIPS.

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:45.661
WITH CITIES FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:47.196
THE LAST COMMENT I I WOULD JUST

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:48.831
MAKE IS AS WE APPROACH THIS.

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:51.066
IT I BELIEVE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:52.668
TO LOOK AT THE RESOURCES THAT

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.503
DISTRICTS AND THE DEPARTMENT

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.572
RECEIVED TO ACTUALLY CARRY OUT

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:58.574
THE WORK ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE --

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:01.610
ONE LIAISON TO SERVE --

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:02.244
FOURTEEN HUNDRED ELLIE ACE THANK

01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:03.612
YOU.

01:08:03.679 --> 01:08:06.115
THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE --

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:09.618
CENTER WIENER HAS THREE I

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:11.220
REQUEST IS FOR BRINGING THIS

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:13.489
IMPORTANT AUTO REQUEST TO US IN

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:16.358
A A FULLY SUPPORT IT.

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:18.160
ON I I THINK.

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:19.862
THE NUMBERS THAT I'VE SEEN IN

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:20.896
MAY PERHAPS ARE IT'S AN

01:08:20.963 --> 01:08:23.566
UNDERCOUNT BUT EVEN WITHOUT.

01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:25.868
PROBABLE UNDER CAL I'VE SEEN

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.069
STATEWIDE.

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:29.038
WE HAVE 5% OF STUDENTS ABOUT

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.940
STATEWIDE THE NUMBERS THAT I'VE

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.107
SEEN ARE HOMELESS.

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:34.510
WHICH EVEN 5% IF IT EVEN IF IT'S

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:35.611
NOT HIGHER THAT'S IT'S

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:37.480
OUTRAGEOUS ARE PARTICULARLY

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:38.848
OUTRAGEOUS AND CENTER MINING'S

01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:42.151
DISTRICT AND SALINAS AREA --

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.252
OUT BUT IT'S JUST IT'S SOME IT'S

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:48.224
A IT'S A MORAL FAILING --

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.091
BY OUR STATE.

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:49.925
BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

01:08:49.992 --> 01:08:51.927
I HOPE THAT THIS IS HELPS LAY

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:54.029
GROUNDWORK FOR OTHER FORMS OF

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:55.998
CHANGE ONE MORE DATA POINT

01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:57.600
IMPORTANT DATA POINT --

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.268
AND THERE'S TWO THINGS I WANT TO

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:00.603
POINT OUT THE FIRST IS THAT I

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:02.071
THINK THAT THERE IS A PERCEPTION

01:09:02.137 --> 01:09:03.873
WITH THE HOMELESSNESS.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:05.374
CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:07.209
HOMELESSNESS IS A IT IS SIMPLY

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:08.410
ABOUT --

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.279
MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION AND

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.747
ALTHOUGH WE OF COURSE AND ARE

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:12.982
HOMELESS POPULATION OF SIX

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.383
SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:17.319
ADDICTION CHALLENGES ABSOLUTELY --

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:20.789
SO MANY HOME HUGE OF PORTION OF

01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:21.957
OUR HOME SUBDIVISION ARE NOT.

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:23.926
MENTALLY ILL ARE NOT ADDICTED

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:28.297
THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD HOUSING --

01:09:28.364 --> 01:09:31.100
AND TO ME WHEN YOU HAVE.

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:32.535
THEY'RE THEY'RE LIVING IN A

01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:35.337
SHELTER OR A CAR OR GOING FROM

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.839
THE CHARTER MOTEL AND THERE'S

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.374
SOME HELL ABLE TO HOLD IT

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.909
TOGETHER TO GET THEIR KID TO

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.777
SCHOOL IN THE MORNING TO GET TO

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.112
WORK TO DO WITH THE NEW THAT'S

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:45.047
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING TO ME IT

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:45.514
SHOWS HOW RESILIENT.

01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:47.983
PEOPLE ARE UP WE HAVE TO DO MORE

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.351
TO HELP --

01:09:49.418 --> 01:09:51.053
THESE FOLKS AND IT'S NOT IT WE

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.656
CAN'T JUST FOCUS ONLY ON MENTAL

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:54.290
HEALTH AND ADDICTION IS A POOR

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.958
AND THAT IS.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.560
IT'S ABOUT HELPING THEM.

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.295
AND THAT GETS TO THE DEEPER

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.697
ISSUE OF WHY ARE WE DRIVING

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:03.599
FAMILIES IN THE HOMELESSNESS AND

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.167
LET'S BE CLEAR IT'S NOT TO IT

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:06.535
DOESN'T JUST RANDOMLY HAPPEN.

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:08.571
WE AS A STATE DUE TO POLICY

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:10.306
CHOICES AROUND HOUSING OR

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:11.774
DRIVING FAMILIES IN THE

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.142
HOMELESSNESS OR DRIVING FAMILIES

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:14.877
IN THE POVERTY OR DRIVING

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:16.211
CHILDREN IN THE HOME WITH US.

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:18.914
BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO CREATE AN

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:19.949
OF HOUSING IN THE CITY

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:21.517
CALIFORNIA AT ALL INCOME LEVELS

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:23.352
AND WE HAVE ALLOWED COMMUNITIES

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:24.787
TO OPT OUT.

01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:26.055
THE BUILDING HOUSING WE HAVE

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:27.656
ALLOWED COMMUNITIES --

ARE HOMELESS.

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:22.211
AND I AGREE WITH SENATOR WE KNOW

01:11:22.277 --> 01:11:24.079
THAT THIS IS ABOUT.

01:11:24.146 --> 01:11:26.215
IT'S A MORAL FAILURE ON US THAT

01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:27.816
WE'RE NOT PROVIDING THE KIDS

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.518
WITH THE ADVANTAGE THAT I HAVE

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:30.386
GOING FOR IT.

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:31.920
I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:44.133
VERY BROAD AND VERY DEEP

MEASUREMENT OF MCKINNEY VENTO

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:46.869
WHERE AS I THINK SOME OF THE

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:48.270
OTHER CITIES IN MY DISTRICT I

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:49.071
DON'T THINK HAVE AS BROAD AS IN

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:49.705
DEEP SO.

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:51.140
YOU'RE LOOKING AT I MAYBE ONE

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.908
WITH BEST PRACTICE THAT MIGHT BE

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:54.343
A SUGGESTION --

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:56.378
TO CONSIDER THAT --

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:57.546

COUNCIL WE AT ACTIVE PROGRAMS TO

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:03.852
ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS.

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:05.754
AND I KNOW EVERY CITY OF MY

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:08.724
DISTRICT DOES IN LAST YEAR'S

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:09.992
MONEY FOR HOMELESSNESS OF THE

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:11.627
COUNTIES SO HOW ARE THE SCHOOL

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:12.628
DISTRICTS CORNING WITH THE

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:14.463
COUNTIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:15.798
MONEY THAT WAS ALLOCATED THE

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:17.966
COUNTIES ACTUALLY GET TO SERVE

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:20.869
THESE HOMELESS KIDS.

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:22.538
CAN YOU ASSIST WITH THAT.

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:23.839
GOING BACK TO THE DEFINITION

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:25.140
COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO GIVE YOU

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:26.408
A LITTLE BACKGROUND THERE'S A

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:29.578
DEFINITION DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:30.379
HOUSING UNDER HOOD.

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:32.781

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:35.084
FAMILIES THAT ARE --

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.585
POSSIBLY IDENTIFIED AS HOMELESS

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:38.787
IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT MIGHT NOT

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:40.122
ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR HAD

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.024
SERVICES AND THERE'S A

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:44.359
DISCONNECT THERE BUT AGAIN GOING

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:46.128
BACK -- TO

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:47.996
MY COLLEAGUES DISCUSSION

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:50.232
LIAISONS DON'T NECESSARILY

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:52.134
ALWAYS HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.402
MAKE THOSE COLLABORATION

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:56.071
COORDINATION THEY'RE WEARING TWO

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:58.640
THREE SOMETIMES FOUR FIVE HATS --

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:00.776

SERVICES ARE THERE --

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:20.262
BUT IT IS A CAPACITY ISSUE.

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:20.963

WE DO THIS AUDIT WILL WE LOOK

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:26.034

THOSE BEST PRACTICES IN

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:38.113
COORDINATION WITH THE CITIES AND

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.481
COUNTIES BECAUSE HOPEFULLY WE'RE

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:41.049
ALL WORKING ON OUT TOWARDS THE

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:42.684

WE HAVE TRIED EACH YEAR TO

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.452
ACQUIRE THAT INFORMATION AND

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:58.987
HAVE YET TO HAVE FAILED TO DO SO

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:00.322
SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN HERE FOR

SENATE ASKING FOR THIS AND AND

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:10.298
BEING VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR WHO

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:11.900
FELT IT WAS TOO EARLY. TO

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:13.501
ACTUALLY BEGIN TO EXAMINE WHAT

01:21:13.568 --> 01:21:14.836
WE HAD DONE.

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:16.204
IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE STATE

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:16.871
OUGHT TO FIND TO THEY'LL SEE IF

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:18.373
THE FUNDS ARE BEING ALLOCATED

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.774
PROPERLY TO HELP STUDENTS

CALIFORNIA K. TWELVE SYSTEM.

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:30.318
I BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO CONDUCT

01:21:30.385 --> 01:21:31.519
A REVIEW OF BILL C. F. F. TO

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:32.721
DETERMINE WHETHER DISTRICT

EXPENDITURES ON LCF HAVE BEEN

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:36.091
APPROPRIATE AND OF LOCAL CONTROL

01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:37.559
ACCOUNTABILITY PLANTS ARE

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:38.760
MEETING THE GOALS NECESSARY TO

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:40.528
ENSURE IMPROVED EDUCATIONAL

01:21:40.595 --> 01:21:42.230
OUTCOMES. FOR STUDENTS WERE

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:43.732
CHRONICALLY LOW ACHIEVEMENT.

01:21:43.798 --> 01:21:45.200
AT THE BUDGET LEVEL WE ARE A

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:47.669
COSTLY AND BEING PREPARED --

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:48.336
TO TO ADD MORE MONEY TO ELSE IF

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:49.838
IF IT IS NOW CURRENTLY FULLY

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:50.572
FUNDED.

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.940
AND OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUE TO

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.174
TRY TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:54.509
FUNDING WITH IT THE QUESTION

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:55.810
BECOMES IS THIS THE MOST

01:21:55.877 --> 01:21:57.379
APPROPRIATE METHOD TO DO THE

01:21:57.445 --> 01:21:58.613
KIND OF FUNDING THAT WE WANT TO

01:21:58.680 --> 01:21:59.681
SEE WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:01.683
CHALLENGES TO ELSE EFF OVER THE

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:05.553
LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:10.125
AND IS NOW HERE WE THAT DOWN

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:12.027
THERE WAS A POCKET A SIGNIFICANT

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:13.361
POCKET OF STUDENTS WHO ARE BEING

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:15.864
AND WOULD BE UNSERVED AND LCF IN

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:17.599
SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT IN

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:18.867
AS A RESULT A TO READ AND IT

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:20.001
RESULTED IN THREE HUNDRED

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:21.703
MILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS GOING

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:22.103
TO THOSE.

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.872
SPECIFIC STUDENTS WE MADE SOME

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:25.740
ASSUMPTIONS WHEN WE STARTED THIS

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:27.676
LC FF AND I WAS INTRICATELY

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:29.144
INVOLVED IN IT --

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:30.378
THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:32.280
THAT THAT COSTS CHILDREN TO NOT

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:33.448
TO DO WELL AND WE HAVE DONE A

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:34.883
FIVE THOSE ISSUES ONLY TO

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:35.950
DISCOVER THAT MAYBE THOSE WERE

01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:37.319
NOT THE REAL ISSUES THAT

01:22:37.385 --> 01:22:38.186
AFFECTED THE ACHIEVEMENT OF

01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:38.987
STUDENTS.

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:40.689
WE ALSO MADE SOME ASSUMPTIONS

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.090
THAT WE WOULD NOT USE MONEY FOR

01:22:42.157 --> 01:22:43.291
CERTAIN PURPOSES LIKE SALARY

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:45.026
INCREASES WE KNOW THAT THAT WAS

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:46.061
CHANGED --

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:47.796
NOT BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT BY

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:49.664
THE SUPERINTENDENT AT THAT TIME

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:51.032
THAT THOSE MONIES CAN GO THERE

COVER THE SCHOOLS ON THIS ISSUE --

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:00.715
ONE QUESTION IS.

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:01.449
UP.

01:32:01.515 --> 01:32:03.284
THE THE CRITERIA FOR YOUR

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:06.787
SELECTION OF WHICH SCHOOLS.

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.422
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT COULD FIT

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:10.024
PROBABLY.

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:11.692
I DON'T KNOW HUNDRED HUNT

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:13.561

SO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO GET A

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:18.532
BETTER SENSE OF WHAT WOULD GO

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:20.601
INTO THE PROCESS THAT'S THAT'S

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:23.504
ONE AND IF IN THE PROCESS.

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:24.906
THERE WAS A WAY OF FIGURING OUT

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:26.941
THERE MAY BE SCHOOLS FOR PARENTS

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:29.010
OR COMMUNITY WERE DEEPLY

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:30.411
INVOLVED.

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:33.381
IN THE PROCESS OF EL CAP TO TRY

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:35.349
TO MAKE IT WORK AS MUCH AS A

01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:36.951
POSSIBLE --

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:38.886
A WORK FOR THE RIGHT WAYS AND

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:40.888
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT MAYBE

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:43.291
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO LIST HERE

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:44.692
LIKE PARENT AND COMMUNITY

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:46.160
INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROCESS.

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:47.628

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:50.264
WELL BIG.

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:52.266
A I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:54.669
MODELS FOR IT TO WORK GOOD AND

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:56.871
WHERE THE BAD MODELS OF NOT TO

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:58.572
FOLLOW AND THAT'S NOT ALWAYS

01:32:58.639 --> 01:32:59.907
EXACTLY.

01:32:59.974 --> 01:33:02.410
YOU KNOW BY NUMBERS THAT WE CAN

01:33:02.476 --> 01:33:06.213
FIGURE THAT OUT THANK YOU THE OF

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.215
THE LAW THAT TALKS ABOUT L. C.

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:09.016
F. F. AS WELL AS EVEN THE L.

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:11.619

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:12.186
OF PARENT ENGAGEMENT PARENT

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:13.321
INVOLVEMENT.

01:33:13.387 --> 01:33:14.522
AND THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:33:14.588 --> 01:33:16.123
THESE PLANS IS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:17.325
PRESENTED TO PARENTS.

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:19.360
AND APPROVED BY APPEARANCE AND

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:20.561
MOST DISTRICTS IF YOU GO TO BAY

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:21.896
PARENTS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S

01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:23.631
GOING ON WELL EITHER WAY IT'S

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:25.166

TO SAY OKAY --

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:29.670
AND MOST OF THEM THEY CAN'T

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:30.237
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HECK IS

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:32.440
GOING ON AND IF YOU READ THE L.

01:33:32.506 --> 01:33:33.941
CAPS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ON

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:35.543
THE INTERNET THAT IS SUPPOSED TO

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:36.844
BE DESIGNED FOR PARENTS ARE BUT

01:33:36.911 --> 01:33:38.245
REALLY DESIGNED FOR IT.

01:33:38.312 --> 01:33:39.480
I DON'T KNOW RESEARCHERS MAYBE

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:41.182
BECAUSE MOST PARENTS AND MOST OF

01:33:41.248 --> 01:33:42.616
US CAN'T READ THEM CORRECTLY.

01:33:42.683 --> 01:33:45.086
AND SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S ONE OF

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:45.886
THOSE THINGS WHAT'S PARENTS AS

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:47.755

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:49.757
WHAT WOULD THIS THING SUPPOSED

01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:51.659
TO DO ONE OF THE PIECES WAS

01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:53.294
PLANNING GAVE ME.

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:54.061
IT IS A LAYS SO WHAT YOU'LL

TOGETHER WHO USE PARENT

01:33:58.199 --> 01:33:58.899
INVOLVEMENT.

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:00.301
YOU KNOW THAT THAT ENGAGE WITH

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:02.003
THAT SHOULD BE THERE AS A PART

01:34:02.069 --> 01:34:04.005
OF IT AS SOMETIMES BEEN LOST.

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:06.140
AND OR EITHER DIMINISHED IN

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:11.879
TERMS OF PAN ROLE IN IT --

01:34:11.946 --> 01:34:15.082
AND DOES SO AS A RESULT I'VE OF

01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:15.916
PARENT ENGAGEMENT PARENT

01:34:15.983 --> 01:34:17.184
INVOLVEMENT HOW THEY DON'T KNOW

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:19.153
WHAT THE PLAN WAS AND I SAY WELL

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.154
YOU DISTRICT AS OPPOSED TO DO

01:34:20.221 --> 01:34:20.988
THIS AND THEY SAID WELL THEY

01:34:21.055 --> 01:34:21.789
DIDN'T ALL THEY CAME IN A

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:22.523
MEETING.

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:23.991
SLAP IT ON THE TABLE TOTAL THIS

01:34:24.058 --> 01:34:25.493
IS WHAT IT WAS AND THEN IT WENT

01:34:25.559 --> 01:34:27.261
ON TO SOMETHING ELSE AND SO SO

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:28.696
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THERE AND

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:29.764
IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LAWN

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:32.967
WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES IT

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:35.469
REQUIRES A LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT.

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:36.537
SO WITH THAT WORK.

01:34:36.604 --> 01:34:37.071
WOULD THAT BE PART OF THE

01:34:37.138 --> 01:34:38.406
SELECTION PROCESS OR HOW HOW

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:40.207
COULD THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:34:40.274 --> 01:34:41.475
AND AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE LEFT IT

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:43.377
UP TO OUR OUR AUDITOR TO PICK

01:34:43.444 --> 01:34:44.412
THAT SCHOOLS WE HOPE THAT THERE

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:45.746
ARE LARGE ENOUGH SCHOOLS WHERE

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:47.415
THEY HAVE THE KIND OF DIVERSITY

01:34:47.481 --> 01:34:48.416
OF PROGRAMS.

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:51.185
AND RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE BOB

01:34:51.252 --> 01:34:52.720
AND WHICH WANTED SOMEONE DOING

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:54.021
BETTER THAN OTHERS --

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:55.189
SOME SCHOOLS ARE DOING BETTER

01:34:55.256 --> 01:34:56.724
THAN OTHERS WITHIN A DISTRICT

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:58.626
ITSELF SO WE KIND OF LEFT IT TO

01:34:58.692 --> 01:34:59.760
THE AUDITOR'S WE WOULDN'T.

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:01.162
WE WOULDN'T HAVE JUST A A KIND

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:02.863
OF A SPECIALTY SCHOOL WHERE IT

01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:03.664
ONLY HAVE CERTAIN THINGS THAT

01:35:03.731 --> 01:35:05.066
HAPPEN BUT BROUGHT ENOUGH IN

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:07.368
TERMS OF PROGRAMS AND STUDENTS

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:08.569
AND THE POPULATIONS IS THERE TO

01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:09.904
MAKE A DISTINCTION.

01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:13.374
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WHAT WE

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:13.874
DISCOVER IF YOU'VE GOT A

01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:14.642
DISTRICT WHERE.

01:35:14.708 --> 01:35:15.643
THE WHOLE DISTRICT AND SO I

01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:16.210
THINK THAT MAYBE ONE OF SAN

01:35:16.277 --> 01:35:16.877
DIEGO WHERE EVERYBODY'S FREE AND

01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:17.478
REDUCED LUNCH WITH THE MONEY

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:18.746
COMES IN AND MAKE IT COULD BE

01:35:18.813 --> 01:35:20.247
DISPERSED ALL THE KIDS. TO PRINT

01:35:20.314 --> 01:35:20.981
AND THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT THE

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:22.483
PROGRAMS BUT OFTENTIMES THE

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:24.185
CHALLENGE BECOMES IN THE LARGE

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:25.519
DISTRICT WHERE YOU HAVE THE

01:35:25.586 --> 01:35:27.154
SOMETIMES A DIVISION BASED ON

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:28.155
ECONOMICS.

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:30.257
AND SO THE MONEY COMES IN ESOS

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:31.792
THE DISTRICT REALLY TAKEN THAT

01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:33.761
EXTRA MONEY AND PUTTING IT INTO

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:35.362
THOSE SCHOOLS THAT REALLY NEEDED

01:35:35.429 --> 01:35:36.530
ARE THEY ARE THEY DISTRIBUTING

01:35:36.597 --> 01:35:38.165
IT A WIDELY AND BROADLY TO

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:38.933
EVERYBODY.

01:35:38.999 --> 01:35:41.168
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT --

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:43.104
WHEN AND I GUESS MOST OF YOU

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.238
KNOW I WAS I WAS SO INVOLVED IN

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:45.406
THIS BECAUSE WHEN THE WHEN I

01:35:45.473 --> 01:35:46.574
BECAME A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.342
THE GOVERNOR ASKED ME TO HELP

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:49.643
HIM GET THIS THROUGH?

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:51.112
AND THERE WERE TWO OF US WHO

01:35:51.178 --> 01:35:54.348
REALLY WORKED HARD --

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:54.882
ONE DEMOCRAT MYSELF IN THE

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:57.384
REPUBLICAN.

01:35:57.451 --> 01:35:59.520
AND PART OF THAT WAS THAT THEY

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:00.821
WOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:36:00.888 --> 01:36:02.523
THERE WOULD BE TRANSPARENCY I

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:03.657
SAID YOU CAN GIVE PEOPLE MONEY

01:36:03.724 --> 01:36:04.558
AND THEN I TELL THEM WHAT TO DO

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:06.160
WITH IT BECAUSE I CAN GUARANTEE

01:36:06.227 --> 01:36:07.194
IT WILL NOT GO WHERE YOU WANTED

01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:08.095
TO GO.

01:36:08.162 --> 01:36:09.163
SO WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE

01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:10.064
WOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY THERE'D

01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:12.099
BE TRANSPARENCY AND ALL THESE

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:13.367
WONDERFUL THINGS AND ALL OF US

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:14.602
WENT BACK TO OUR DISTRICTS AND

01:36:14.668 --> 01:36:15.803
TOLD OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:16.904
THAT ARE STRUGGLING YOU'RE GOING

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:18.873
TO GET 20% MORE FOR THESE KIDS

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:20.407
ISSUE AND THIS THE NEXT AND SO

01:36:20.474 --> 01:36:22.009
FORTH AND SO ON AND WE AND IT

01:36:22.076 --> 01:36:23.644
NEVER REALLY MATERIALIZE THAT

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:24.845
WAY IN MOST DISTRICTS.

01:36:24.912 --> 01:36:26.480
SO -- SO WE

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:27.615
LOOKED AT IT AND AND IN MANY

01:36:27.681 --> 01:36:29.183
WAYS -- SOME

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:31.218
OF THE MY CONCERN IT IT HAS TO

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:32.119
DO WITH MY OWN PERSONAL

01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:33.988
INTEGRITY OF INSURING TO PEOPLE

01:36:34.054 --> 01:36:34.622
THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN I

01:36:34.688 --> 01:36:35.623
WAS NUMBER.

01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:37.224
ONE BUT NUMBER TWO THAT WE HAVE

01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:39.093
DISTRICTS THAT MADE A CONSCIOUS

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.529
DECISION TO SUPPORT THIS EVEN

01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:42.596
THOUGH THEY KNOW KNEW THAT THERE

01:36:42.663 --> 01:36:44.231
DISTRICT WOULD NOT BENEFIT FROM

01:36:44.298 --> 01:36:44.398
IT.

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:46.066
BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH OF

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:47.301
FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH KIDS IN

01:36:47.368 --> 01:36:48.636
THAT HAVE NOTHING FALL SECURE

01:36:48.702 --> 01:36:50.371
BUT THEY BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:52.072
USE THE MONEY APPROPRIATELY. TO

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:53.874
HELP KIDS WITH STRUGGLING IN ALL

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:55.376
OF US WHO SIGNED ON TO IT

01:36:55.442 --> 01:36:56.410
BELIEVE THAT EVEN IF WE HAD

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:57.878
DISTRICTS BUT CERTAIN DISTRICTS

01:36:57.945 --> 01:36:59.613
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH STUDENTS.

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.550
THE COMMITMENT WAS AT THE STATE

01:37:02.616 --> 01:37:06.187
LEVEL THEY AND AS A RESULT THOSE

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:07.655
AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES MIGHT

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:09.390
SUFFER QUOTE UNQUOTE BUT NOT

01:37:09.456 --> 01:37:10.758
GIVING THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY.

01:37:10.824 --> 01:37:12.059
THAT WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN

01:37:12.126 --> 01:37:13.494
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE DISTRICT

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:14.995
SO I FEEL SINCE IT AND I HOPE

01:37:15.062 --> 01:37:16.463
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES IT WE HAVE

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.364
TO BE HAVE SOME INTEGRITY ABOUT

01:37:17.431 --> 01:37:18.032
THIS.

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:20.467
THAT THOSE DISTRICTS TRUSTED US

01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:23.037
TO ENSURE THAT IF WE TOOK MONEY

01:37:23.103 --> 01:37:25.072
THAT WAS NOT DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY

01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:26.407
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:37:26.473 --> 01:37:27.808
THAT WE WOULD DO WOULD DUE

01:37:27.875 --> 01:37:29.210
DILIGENCE MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

01:37:29.276 --> 01:37:30.744
KIDS ARE STRUGGLING THE HEART IS

01:37:30.811 --> 01:37:32.379
WOULD GET THE RESOURCES THAT WE

01:37:32.446 --> 01:37:34.148
WOULD CLOSE THIS ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:35.482
AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE WAYS OF

01:37:35.549 --> 01:37:36.984
DOING SO WITHOUT SOME

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:39.086
ACCOUNTABILITY IN DISCUSSION IT

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:40.621
MAY IT'S NOT HAPPENING AND SO

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:41.855
THAT'S A THAT'S A PART OF IT.

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:43.924
THE THE WHOLE ISSUE OF WHAT

01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:44.592
WE'RE GONNA DO BUT WE'LL SEE IF

01:37:44.658 --> 01:37:46.060
IF AND AS WE TALK ABOUT MOVING

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:47.595
FORWARD I DON'T WANT TO GET DOWN

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:49.029
TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW AS WE HAVE

01:37:49.096 --> 01:37:50.130
WITH ALL THE CATEGORIES AND

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:50.998
DISCOVER WHAT YOU KNOW IT WAS A

01:37:51.065 --> 01:37:52.199
BAD PLAN.

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:53.667
WE CITIZENS OF MALES WE COULD

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:55.202
LOOK AT IT A DIFFERENT WAY --

01:37:55.269 --> 01:37:56.937
IT IS AFTER FIVE YEARS IT IS

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:58.472
TIME FOR US TO ASSESS WHAT THE

01:37:58.539 --> 01:38:00.007
NOT GUILTY OF THIS IS WHAT WE

01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:01.242
WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO.

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:02.443
AND IS THIS WAY THAT WE FEEL WE

01:38:02.509 --> 01:38:03.978
CAN FIND OUR SCHOOLS AND

01:38:04.044 --> 01:38:05.913
ACTUALLY GET THE RESOURCES. TO

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:06.547
THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT BUT MOST

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:11.185
IMPORTANT TO GET THE RESULTS WE

01:38:11.252 --> 01:38:13.120
WANT ALL THE KIDS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:38:13.187 --> 01:38:14.088
THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:14.755
APPRECIATE YOUR DUE DILIGENCE ON

01:38:14.822 --> 01:38:15.923
THAT I REMEMBER THAT DISCUSSIONS

01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.790
IN THE FIGHTS WHEN WE'RE

01:38:16.857 --> 01:38:18.759
DISCUSSING LC FF AND ENSURING

01:38:18.826 --> 01:38:19.393
THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:20.961
CAN -- TO

01:38:21.028 --> 01:38:23.097
ASSIST THOSE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT

01:38:23.163 --> 01:38:24.632
REALLY NEED IT OKAY AT THAT TIME

01:38:24.698 --> 01:38:25.733
SIR MUNNINGS QUESTION HAS BEEN

01:38:25.799 --> 01:38:27.401
ANSWERED WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO

01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:28.936
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON.

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:30.237
THANK YOU JUST A COMMENT --

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:32.640
WANTED -- TO

01:38:32.706 --> 01:38:34.441
ECHO THAT THE CONCERN THAT

01:38:34.508 --> 01:38:37.645
SENATOR ROTH RAISED WITH RESPECT --

01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:40.247
TO WE WE HAVE TO SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:38:40.314 --> 01:38:42.383
ONE LARGER ONE SMALLER --

01:38:42.449 --> 01:38:43.951
BASICALLY YOU CAN GO DOWN A

01:38:44.018 --> 01:38:46.453
MAJOR ROAD IN FRESNO AND CLOVIS

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:48.155
AND ON ONE SIDE IT'S ONE ON THE

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:49.256
OTHER IT'S THE OTHER.

01:38:49.323 --> 01:38:50.624
THE PERCENTAGES IN THE LARGER

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:52.126
SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE ARE

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:53.193
OBVIOUSLY --

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.828
A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGE BUT THERE

01:38:54.895 --> 01:38:56.864
ARE SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGES LAST

01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:58.866
THEN OBVIOUSLY IN THE SMALLER

01:38:58.932 --> 01:39:00.567
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:01.368
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET IN ONE

01:39:01.435 --> 01:39:03.337
DISTRICT AS COMPARED TO ANOTHER

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:05.706
THE SAME CHILD WITH THE SAME

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:08.242
PATHOLOGIES IN THE SAME ISSUES.

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:10.010
IS GETTING HALF AS MUCH PER

01:39:10.077 --> 01:39:12.146
PUPIL AS THE ONE SIMPLY ON THE

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:13.347
OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.

01:39:13.414 --> 01:39:16.784
THE SECOND AREA OF OF CONCERN IS

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:19.853
THAT THE SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.222
IS ACTUALLY SEEING A LARGE

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:26.860
INFLUX OF PARENTS REQUESTING.

01:39:26.927 --> 01:39:27.861
AT THE MOVE FROM THE LARGER

01:39:27.928 --> 01:39:29.763
SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH ALL THE LC

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:31.865
INVEST MONEY INTO A THE SMALLER

01:39:31.932 --> 01:39:34.435
SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WHY IS THAT

01:39:34.501 --> 01:39:34.735
[inaudible]

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:37.271
THE SUCCESS OF THE SMALLER

01:39:37.338 --> 01:39:38.972
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:40.541
ACROSS THE STREET WITH ENGLISH

01:39:40.607 --> 01:39:42.476
LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND WITH

01:39:42.543 --> 01:39:44.411
POVERTY CHILDREN IS ABSOLUTELY

01:39:44.478 --> 01:39:45.379
REMARKABLE.

01:39:45.446 --> 01:39:47.648
AND FAMILIES ARE BEGINNING TO

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:48.882
KIND OF FIGURE THAT OUT.

01:39:48.949 --> 01:39:50.951
AND SO THERE IS A SENSE AT LEAST

01:39:51.018 --> 01:39:53.654
IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT BIG GAPS

01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:55.255
ARE THE FUNDING --

01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:59.293
BUT SMALLER BUT SUCCESSFUL --

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.961
TO GET HALF AS MUCH SO THERE

01:40:01.028 --> 01:40:02.563
SEEMS TO BE A DISPARITY THERE IF

01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:04.465
REACHING.

01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:07.835
FAMILIES AND KIDS IS IT ENGLISH

01:40:07.901 --> 01:40:09.303
LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND POVERTY

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:12.373
KIDS IS THE GOAL WE OUGHT TO AT

01:40:12.439 --> 01:40:14.141
LEAST BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:15.776
IN SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:17.378
PERCENTAGES MAY BE.

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:19.079
SMALLER BUT THE ACTUAL

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:20.481
ACHIEVEMENT.

01:40:20.547 --> 01:40:23.450
IS SUPERB AND THAT OUGHT TO BE

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:24.885
WORDED RATHER THAN IN SOME

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:26.086
INSTANCES WHERE.

01:40:26.153 --> 01:40:27.321
SOME PARENTS IN THE SCHOOL

01:40:27.388 --> 01:40:28.522
DISTRICTS FEEL THAT THAT THERE'S

01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:30.090
A PENALTY FOR IT SO THAT'S

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:33.761
THAT'S JUST A OBSERVATION FROM.

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:36.029
THE DISTRICTS IN OUR IN IN IN

01:40:36.096 --> 01:40:37.931
WHERE I REPRESENT.

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:38.899
BUT I THINK IN YOU'VE DISCOVERED

01:40:38.966 --> 01:40:40.434
ACROSS THE STATE THERE ARE A

01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:41.769
WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT VARIABLES

01:40:41.835 --> 01:40:42.703
THAT IMPACT.

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:44.071
STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND STUDENT

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:45.072
SUCCESS AND THAT'S A GOOD THING

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:46.907
THAT IT'S NOT JUST DEPENDENT

01:40:46.974 --> 01:40:47.975
UPON THE MONEY THAT YOU GET BUT

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:49.443
MORE IMPORTANT SO IT DEPENDS

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:50.844
UPON THE PEOPLE IN THE CLASSROOM.

01:40:50.911 --> 01:40:51.678
AND THE COMMITMENT OF THE

01:40:51.745 --> 01:40:52.946
LEADERSHIP AT THAT SCHOOL TO

01:40:53.013 --> 01:40:54.681
MAKE THINGS HAPPEN FOR KIDS SO

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:55.883
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:40:55.949 --> 01:40:57.084
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT EVEN

01:40:57.151 --> 01:40:58.519
THOUGH WE'RE GIVING MONEY.

01:40:58.585 --> 01:40:59.787
IT WILL NOT.

01:40:59.853 --> 01:41:01.288
MAKE A DIFFERENCE UNLESS IT IS

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:03.390
APPROPRIATELY USED AND IN THE

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:04.892
CLASSROOM FOR STUDENTS AND I

01:41:04.958 --> 01:41:05.959
THINK WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT OVER

01:41:06.026 --> 01:41:07.528
THE YEARS AS WE'VE SEEN MONEY

01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:08.295
INCREASE.

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:09.396
WE NOT NECESSARILY SEEING THE

01:41:09.463 --> 01:41:11.365
RESULTS BECAUSE IT WOULD DO SOME

01:41:11.432 --> 01:41:12.132
THINGS BUT IT WON'T DO

01:41:12.199 --> 01:41:12.933
EVERYTHING.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.568

01:41:15.602 --> 01:41:17.504
DESIRABLE BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:18.405
TO ACTUALLY MEET THE NEEDS OF

01:41:18.472 --> 01:41:22.109
STUDENTS SOME LARGE DISTRICTS

01:41:22.176 --> 01:41:22.709
STRUGGLE BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:23.277
LARGE.

01:41:23.343 --> 01:41:23.877

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:25.813
FOCUS ON SOMETIMES THE ISSUES

01:41:25.879 --> 01:41:27.214

THAT THE COMMITTEE APPROVED A

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:17.344

01:45:24.551 --> 01:45:26.520
DEFICIT LIVE LITERALLY TEETERING

01:45:26.586 --> 01:45:29.089
ON THE BREAK BRINK OF INSOLVENCY.

01:45:29.156 --> 01:45:31.091
THE STATE TAKEOVER --

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:32.559
POTENTIALLY LOOMING.

01:45:32.626 --> 01:45:34.461
THIS PAST FALL ARE COUNTY OFFICE

01:45:34.528 --> 01:45:35.962
OF EDUCATION REJECTED OUR

01:45:36.029 --> 01:45:38.231
DISTRICTS BUDGET PLAN BECAUSE IT

01:45:38.298 --> 01:45:41.435
WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO RELATE TO

01:45:41.501 --> 01:45:43.170
ON GOING DEFICIT SPENDING.

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:44.638
A FEW WEEKS LATER OUR STATE

01:45:44.705 --> 01:45:46.406
FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT TEAM

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:47.307
VIC MATT.

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:49.476
I REVIEWED THEIR DISTRICT

01:45:49.543 --> 01:45:50.944
INCLUDES AN ALSO CONCLUDED THE

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:53.714
DISTRICT IS AT HIGH RISK --

01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:55.182
FOR INSOLVENCY.

01:45:55.248 --> 01:45:58.485
AND ESSENTIALLY THEY FOUND THAT --

01:45:58.552 --> 01:45:59.653
THE DISTRICT AND IS GOING TO RUN

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.722
OUT OF CASH AND SO WE KNOW THAT

01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:02.923
WE WE KNOW THE DISTRICT IS

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:04.391
ACTUALLY WORKING HARD TO ADDRESS

01:46:04.458 --> 01:46:06.193
THAT AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:06.793
THEY'RE GOING TO IN THE NEAR

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:07.728
FUTURE.

01:46:07.794 --> 01:46:09.463
BUT THE BIGGER QUESTION REMAINS

01:46:09.529 --> 01:46:11.765
IS IS HOW DO WE GET HERE WHAT

01:46:11.832 --> 01:46:13.100
CAN WE DO TO PREVENT THIS

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:14.601
DISTRICT ANOTHER SIMILAR

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:17.838
DISTRICTS. FOR IT FROM THESE

01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:21.208
ISSUES IN YOU KNOW FOCUS ON THE

01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:22.809
BIG PICTURE HERE I THINK THE

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:24.711
ISSUE THAT REALLY MAKES MY

01:46:24.778 --> 01:46:27.080
CONSTITUENTS AND ME FRANKLY AND

01:46:27.147 --> 01:46:28.815
MY COLLEAGUES WHO REPRESENT THE

01:46:28.882 --> 01:46:30.383
SECRETARY UP SCRATCHED HER HEAD.

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:32.185
IS THIS DISTRICT IS AT THE BRINK

01:46:32.252 --> 01:46:33.720
OF INSOLVENCY AT A TIME WHEN

01:46:33.787 --> 01:46:35.122
WE'VE INCREASED REVENUE FROM THE

01:46:35.188 --> 01:46:38.358
STATE BY 50%. 250% MORE MONEY

01:46:38.425 --> 01:46:40.060
FOR MY TAX DOLLARS GOING TO THE

01:46:40.127 --> 01:46:41.661
SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEY'VE

01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:42.963
NEVER BEEN MORE BROKE AND

01:46:43.029 --> 01:46:44.464
USUALLY HAVE DISTRICTS WHO ARE

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:46.133
ABOUT TO GO BROKE WHEN WE'RE IN

01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:47.000
A RECESSION.

01:46:47.067 --> 01:46:48.902
WHEN THERE'S LESS MONEY GOING TO

01:46:48.969 --> 01:46:50.604
A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:52.139
RIGHT HERE --

01:46:52.205 --> 01:46:54.207
THE IS IS REALLY --

01:46:54.274 --> 01:46:55.742
AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIGURE OUT

01:46:55.809 --> 01:46:57.644
WHAT HAPPENED AND HOW WE CAN

01:46:57.711 --> 01:47:00.447
PREVENT THIS FROM.

01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:01.581
EVER HAPPENING AGAIN.

01:47:01.648 --> 01:47:03.683
AND I WILL STE A STATE THAT --

01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:05.685
THIS IS NOT THE ONLY DISTRICT

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:06.253
THAT HAS GOING THROUGH TOUGH

01:47:06.319 --> 01:47:08.088
TIMES. THIRTY SIX UP AND DOWN

01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:10.190
CALIFORNIA NOT ME DISTRICTS ARE

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:11.625
AT THIS POINT WITH THICK MAT

01:47:11.691 --> 01:47:13.226
LITERALLY ON THE ON THE VERGE OF

01:47:13.293 --> 01:47:15.295
RUNNING OUT OF CASH AND SO --

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:16.596
YOU COULD PROBABLY HAVE THE SAME

01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:18.565
DISCUSSIONS FOR QUITE A FEW

02:00:03.729 --> 02:00:06.566
INCOME ELIGIBLE STUDENTS.

02:00:06.632 --> 02:00:08.100
AS HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE NEWS

02:00:08.167 --> 02:00:09.669
OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS HAD TO

02:00:09.735 --> 02:00:11.170
DISAPPROVE BUDGETS AND IS

02:00:11.237 --> 02:00:12.471
CURRENTLY AT RISK.

02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:14.473
OF STATE TAKEOVER IF WE CANNOT

02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:15.942
ACHIEVE THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN

02:00:16.008 --> 02:00:16.976
CUTS BY JUNE TO BALANCE OUR

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:18.644
BUDGET.

02:00:18.711 --> 02:00:20.146
AS YOU KNOW STATE TAKEOVER WOULD

02:00:20.212 --> 02:00:22.248
HAVE MANY DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:24.150
SCHOOLS --

02:00:24.216 --> 02:00:24.650
BUT I WANT TO GIVE A FEW

02:00:24.717 --> 02:00:25.818
EXAMPLES.

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:27.687
SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD MEAN AMONG

02:00:27.753 --> 02:00:29.822
OTHER THINGS THAT LESS MONEY

02:00:29.889 --> 02:00:31.123
WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO SPEND ON

02:00:31.190 --> 02:00:32.391
OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE WE WOULD

02:00:32.458 --> 02:00:34.093
PAY MARKET RATE INTEREST ON A

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.595
STATE LAW ON THAT WOULD BE ISSUE

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:37.563
TO US.

02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:38.631
AND APPOINTED ADMINISTRATOR

02:00:38.698 --> 02:00:40.132
WOULD TAKE OVER AND LOCAL

02:00:40.199 --> 02:00:42.702
CONTROL WOULD BE LOST.

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:44.136
I SHOWN ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE

02:00:44.203 --> 02:00:46.405
IN OTHER EXAMPLES RECOVERY COULD

02:00:46.472 --> 02:00:49.041
TAKE MORE THAN TEN YEARS.

02:00:49.108 --> 02:00:50.643
AND OVERALL EXPERTS AGREE THAT A

02:00:50.710 --> 02:00:52.111
STATE TAKEOVER IS BAD FOR

02:00:52.178 --> 02:00:54.747
STUDENTS.

02:00:54.814 --> 02:00:55.881
OVER THE PAST YEAR WE'VE

02:00:55.948 --> 02:00:57.950
UNDERGONE FOR FINANCIAL REVIEWS

02:00:58.017 --> 02:00:59.318

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:00.586
IDENTIFYING AREAS OF FOCUS FOR

02:01:00.653 --> 02:01:02.021

02:02:13.092 --> 02:02:14.994

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:17.703
OVERSIGHT ON THIS MATTER PRIOR.

02:06:17.770 --> 02:06:18.704
WELL.

02:06:18.771 --> 02:06:20.606
AS I SAID I SUPPORT THE INTENSE

02:06:20.673 --> 02:06:22.274
WHICH IS TO LOOK DEEPER AT

02:06:22.341 --> 02:06:23.976
BUSINESS PROCESS SEES IT CETERA

02:06:24.043 --> 02:06:24.777
THAT MIGHT.

02:06:24.843 --> 02:06:26.211
MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:27.746
HAPPEN AGAIN.

02:06:27.813 --> 02:06:29.615
I WAS SIMPLY STATING THAT OUR

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:32.484
FOCUS IS ON MAKING SURE THAT OUR

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:34.453
WORK RESULTS IN A BALANCED

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:36.622
BUDGET SO THAT WE DO NOT RUN OUT

02:06:36.689 --> 02:06:38.457
OF CASH BY NOVEMBER --

02:06:38.524 --> 02:06:39.658
AND WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH

02:06:39.725 --> 02:06:40.826
THE STATE AUDITOR TO MAKE SURE

02:06:40.893 --> 02:06:43.729
THAT ANY FINDINGS BEYOND THAT

02:06:43.796 --> 02:06:44.196
FOR THE LONG TERM ARE

02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:45.197
IMPLEMENTED.

02:06:45.264 --> 02:06:46.632
PERHAPS WE COULD ASK THE AUTHOR

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:48.701
IN THE AUDITOR --

02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:51.470
THE SCOPE OF THIS DIFFERENCE

02:06:51.537 --> 02:06:52.771
BETWEEN THIS AND WHAT THINK MATT

02:06:52.838 --> 02:06:54.239
DATED MAYBE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

02:06:54.306 --> 02:06:55.641
DISCOVERS WE ANTICIPATE.

02:06:55.708 --> 02:06:57.810
CHANTING WELL THERE IT THERE ARE

02:06:57.876 --> 02:06:59.645
TWO HURDLES ONE WE NEED TO GET

02:06:59.712 --> 02:07:01.480
RID OF THE THE EMERGENCY RIGHT

02:07:01.547 --> 02:07:02.381
NOW.

02:07:02.448 --> 02:07:04.149
BUT EVEN DO THAT THE WORD THE

02:07:04.216 --> 02:07:05.451
MARGINS ARE SUPER STAND SO WE

02:07:05.517 --> 02:07:06.618
NEED TO FOCUS ON THE DISTRICT

02:07:06.685 --> 02:07:08.020
GOING FORWARD.

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:10.856
WHAT HAPPENED HOW YOU FOR THIS

02:07:10.923 --> 02:07:11.223
IN THE FUTURE --

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:12.958
Là THEORIES OUT THERE --

02:07:13.025 --> 02:07:14.760
ONGOING EXPENDITURES ONE TIME

02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:17.062
MONEY TOO MUCH ADMINISTRATION

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:18.497
EMPLOYEE CONTRACTS WE COULDN'T

02:07:18.564 --> 02:07:20.366
AFFORD LOT OF BLOAT FEDERAL

02:07:20.432 --> 02:07:22.267
MONEY LEFT ON THE TABLE SO WE

02:07:22.334 --> 02:07:23.302
DON'T REALLY KNOW ALL THESE

02:07:23.369 --> 02:07:24.703
THINGS AND OF THE THE THE THICK

02:07:24.770 --> 02:07:26.105
MAT THE EXISTING ON ITS FOCUS

02:07:26.171 --> 02:07:27.506
WHERE WE ARE TODAY.

02:07:27.573 --> 02:07:28.741
SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS LOOK

02:07:28.807 --> 02:07:30.809
OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD A FIVE

02:07:30.876 --> 02:07:31.443
YEAR PERIOD.

02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:33.412
IT IS WE CAN TAKE A STEP BACK

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:35.314
AND SO THE SUPERINTENDENT THE

02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:36.215
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS THE

02:07:36.281 --> 02:07:37.983
COMMUNITY CAN REALLY HAVE A BUT

02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:39.518
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AS FAR AS

02:07:39.585 --> 02:07:41.720
HOW WE GOT HERE BECAUSE THIS.

02:07:41.787 --> 02:07:43.389
WATER LAS STRAP DISTRICTS THIS

02:07:43.455 --> 02:07:45.124
IS ABNORMAL ALIVE DISTRICTS HAVE

02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:46.458
THE SAME POPULATIONS THE SAME

02:07:46.525 --> 02:07:48.394
DEMOGRAPHICS RIGHT AROUND THIS

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:50.362
AREA AND THEY ARE NOT ABOUT TO

02:07:50.429 --> 02:07:51.663
RUN OUT OF CASH IN THE NEXT SIX

02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:53.232
MONTHS AND SO.

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:55.067
YOU KNOW THIS HAS A SHORT TERM --

02:07:55.134 --> 02:07:56.869
ISSUE THAT THEY'RE WORKING TO

02:07:56.935 --> 02:08:00.139
ADDRESS BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

02:08:00.205 --> 02:08:01.740
LONG TERM PICTURE AS WELL.

02:08:01.807 --> 02:08:02.541
SO THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT

02:08:02.608 --> 02:08:04.543
THAN WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE

02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:05.377
WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE

02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:06.578
SUPERINTENDENTS.

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:08.514
AND COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION --

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:12.551
VIA.

02:08:12.618 --> 02:08:15.988
YES IT WAS WE WROTE THE AUDIT

02:08:16.055 --> 02:08:17.656
REQUEST WITH THAT ONE QUESTION

02:08:17.723 --> 02:08:19.792
MARK WE DIDN'T WANT TO DUPLICATE

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:21.326
WORK AND SO THERE IS THIS OUT

02:08:21.393 --> 02:08:22.394
GETTING IN THE WEEDS TOO MUCH.

02:08:22.461 --> 02:08:23.829
THERE'S A COUNTY OFFICE OF

02:08:23.896 --> 02:08:25.130
EDUCATION IN THIS GROUP CALLED

02:08:25.197 --> 02:08:27.032
FIX MATT THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:28.901
MANAGEMENT TEAM KIND OF BY THE

02:08:28.967 --> 02:08:30.235
STATE TO DEPARTMENT OF THAT.

02:08:30.302 --> 02:08:31.904
WHICH HAS BEEN DOING SOME

02:08:31.970 --> 02:08:33.806
ANALYSIS ON WHERE THEY'RE AT

02:08:33.872 --> 02:08:35.240
TODAY LIKE THE CASTLE ISSUE WHAT

02:08:35.307 --> 02:08:36.275
YOU NEED TO DO.

02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:37.676
TODAY AND TOMORROW THE NEXT FEW

02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:39.411
WEEKS AND SO WE DID WE DIDN'T

02:08:39.478 --> 02:08:41.180
WANT TO DUPLICATE THAT SO THIS

02:08:41.246 --> 02:08:43.982
AUDIT THAT WE CRAFTED.

02:08:44.049 --> 02:08:45.984
GOES WELL BEYOND THAT

02:08:46.051 --> 02:08:46.285
[inaudible]

02:08:46.351 --> 02:08:47.319

02:08:58.397 --> 02:09:00.232

WELL WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IS

02:09:01.633 --> 02:09:02.668
THAT I WORK WITH --

02:09:02.734 --> 02:09:04.236
THE STATE AUDITOR --

02:09:04.303 --> 02:09:04.503
SO THAT --

02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:09.408
WE ARE EXCLUSIVELY ON PASSING A

02:09:09.475 --> 02:09:10.042
BALANCED BUDGET AT THE END OF

02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:11.343
JUNE -- SO

02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:12.578
IF THAT REQUIRES --

02:09:12.644 --> 02:09:14.813
BEGINNING TO DO SOME INTERACTION

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:17.449
SOME --

02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:19.952
GATHERING OF INFORMATION.

02:09:20.018 --> 02:09:20.752
I WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:09:20.819 --> 02:09:22.521
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR

02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:24.556
STAFF'S TIME IS DEDICATED TO THE

02:09:24.623 --> 02:09:26.658
AUDIT AFTER WE PASS A BALANCED

02:09:26.725 --> 02:09:30.863
BUDGET.

02:09:30.929 --> 02:09:33.966
I MEAN I WOULD.

02:09:34.032 --> 02:09:36.735
I AGAIN I I THINK I'M GONNA ECHO

02:09:36.802 --> 02:09:39.104
THE SENTIMENTS OF UNDER BORDERS.

02:09:39.171 --> 02:09:40.906
I REALLY THINK THAT THIS ORDER

02:09:40.973 --> 02:09:41.940
IS FIRST RATE AND HAS A

02:09:42.007 --> 02:09:43.709
FANTASTIC REPUTATION.

02:09:43.775 --> 02:09:45.978
AND WHEN WE PLACE THESE KINDS OF

02:09:46.044 --> 02:09:47.846
DIFFICULT MATTERS IN THE HANDS

02:09:47.913 --> 02:09:48.981
OF THE AUDITOR.

02:09:49.047 --> 02:09:51.383
HER TRACK RECORD HAS BEEN. TO

02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:53.352
FIND OUT THE INFORMATION

02:09:53.418 --> 02:09:55.654
NECESSARY AND TO REALLY GET

02:09:55.721 --> 02:09:56.989
TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION.

02:09:57.055 --> 02:09:58.056
THAT YOU MENTIONED --

02:09:58.123 --> 02:09:59.558
THAT I GUESS YOU HAD A PERIOD OF

02:09:59.625 --> 02:10:02.227
TIME IT FRESNO UNIFIED AND OUT --

02:10:02.294 --> 02:10:04.363
I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT --

02:10:04.429 --> 02:10:07.966
GIVEN SOME OF THE CAN OF US IN.

02:10:08.033 --> 02:10:09.134
FRESNO CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT

02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:11.103
FRESNO.

02:10:11.170 --> 02:10:13.872
UNIFIED THAT THERE IS I THINK A

02:10:13.939 --> 02:10:18.210
SIGNIFICANT QUESTION ABOUT.

02:10:18.277 --> 02:10:19.645
THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:10:19.711 --> 02:10:22.681
AND HOW IT GOT INTO THIS MESS.

02:10:22.748 --> 02:10:26.185
AND IF THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL

02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:27.452
OVERLAY.

02:10:27.519 --> 02:10:30.489
WELL TOUGH --

02:10:30.556 --> 02:10:32.291
SO I'M GOING TO I WAS INTENDING

02:10:32.357 --> 02:10:34.126
TO EITHER NOT VOTE ON THIS.

02:10:34.193 --> 02:10:35.494
BECAUSE OF THE DUPLICATION AND

02:10:35.561 --> 02:10:37.930
BEAT BUT QUITE FRANKLY I THINK

02:10:37.996 --> 02:10:39.765
YOU GOT TO GET DOWN TO TO TO HOW

02:10:39.831 --> 02:10:41.900
DID THIS HAPPEN GO BACK DEEP

02:10:41.967 --> 02:10:43.468
INTO IT --

02:10:43.535 --> 02:10:45.737
IF IT GETS THAT IF IF IT GETS A

02:10:45.804 --> 02:10:46.939
LITTLE BIT ON THE WAY FROM.

02:10:47.005 --> 02:10:49.808
MAY I THINK THIS AUDITOR HAS THE

02:10:49.875 --> 02:10:50.642
SENSITIVITY IN THE

02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:52.211
PROFESSIONALISM --

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:53.779
TO MOVE IT FORWARD WITHOUT

02:10:53.845 --> 02:10:55.714
GETTING IT IN THE WAY.

02:10:55.781 --> 02:10:57.749
AND JUST A LITTLE.

02:10:57.816 --> 02:11:01.453
POINT OF CONCERN HERE BASED ON

02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:04.156
THE FRESNO EXPERIENCE.

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:07.159
WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW.

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:09.861
THE EXTENT TO WHICH THERE'S BEEN

02:11:09.928 --> 02:11:11.997
A SIGNIFICANT FAILURE TO UTILIZE

02:11:12.064 --> 02:11:13.832
FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S A BIG

02:11:13.899 --> 02:11:15.167
QUESTION THAT THAT HAS TO HAVE

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:17.002
SOME ANSWERS NUMBER.

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:17.703
ONE AND NUMBER TWO YES THERE

02:11:17.769 --> 02:11:19.705
WERE CONTRACTS I GUESS IN THE

02:11:19.771 --> 02:11:21.473
THICK MAT THAT SAID QUOTE

02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:23.041
UNQUOTE ON AFFORDABLE.

02:11:23.108 --> 02:11:24.943
BUT I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO KNOW

02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:28.780
ABOUT THE PROCESSES OF HIRING

02:11:28.847 --> 02:11:31.216
ADMINISTRATORS BULKING UP THAT

02:11:31.283 --> 02:11:34.620
THAT THE TOP END WHILE --

02:11:34.686 --> 02:11:36.088
THE SCHOOL --

02:11:36.154 --> 02:11:39.291
AT THE DESK IN FOR STUDENTS.

02:11:39.358 --> 02:11:42.027
IT BEGINS TO BE UPSIDE DOWN SO

02:11:42.094 --> 02:11:43.495
I'VE I'VE SENT TO CHANGE MY MIND

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:44.997
I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS AUDIT

02:11:45.063 --> 02:11:46.031
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO

02:11:46.098 --> 02:11:46.999
GET IN THE WAY.

02:11:47.065 --> 02:11:48.467
AND I THINK YOU BETTER DO SOME

02:11:48.533 --> 02:11:49.935
REAL SERIOUS WORK BETWEEN.

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:52.571
NOW AND I GUESS IN IN JUNE FOR

02:11:52.638 --> 02:11:54.640
THE SAKE OF THE KIDS THAT YOU.

02:11:54.706 --> 02:11:57.142
REPRESENT --

02:11:57.209 --> 02:11:59.378
AND SO I'M GONNA BUT I ON THIS --

02:11:59.444 --> 02:12:01.380
MORLOCK.

02:12:01.446 --> 02:12:04.116
THANK YOU RICHARD I APOLOGIZE

02:12:04.182 --> 02:12:05.317

02:12:05.384 --> 02:12:06.718
PRESENTATION I'M ON ANOTHER

02:12:06.785 --> 02:12:07.919
COMMITTEE THAT'S LOOKING AT THE

02:12:07.986 --> 02:12:08.820
FUTURE THE STATE BOARD OF

02:12:08.887 --> 02:12:10.522
EQUALIZATION SO WE APPRECIATE

02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:12.457
THE TIME YOU ARE HERE THANK ARE

02:12:12.524 --> 02:12:13.392

02:12:13.458 --> 02:12:16.161
MISTER CHAIR I SERVED ON THE FOR

02:12:16.228 --> 02:12:17.396
THE BY PRIOR YEARS SAID THIS

02:12:17.462 --> 02:12:20.565
ROLE ON THE SENATE BUDGET FISCAL

02:12:20.632 --> 02:12:23.735
REVIEW. TWENTY SEVEN ONE WHICH

02:12:23.802 --> 02:12:25.437
OVERSEES EDUCATION.

02:12:25.504 --> 02:12:28.340
AND SO I SPENT SOME TIME.

02:12:28.407 --> 02:12:30.709
YOU KNOW GETTING INTO THIS ROLE --

02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:32.311

THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:12:36.882 --> 02:12:38.884
AND JUST SEE WHAT WE COULD FIND

02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:39.951
THEY'RE NOT EASY TO GET MISTER

02:12:40.018 --> 02:12:41.687
CHAIR THE NOT ALWAYS ON THE

02:12:41.753 --> 02:12:42.921

02:12:42.988 --> 02:12:45.324
INTERESTING BUT IN OUR ROLE AS

LEGISLATORS WE NEED.

02:12:46.958 --> 02:12:48.827
TO LOOK AT DETAILS LIKE THIS

02:12:48.894 --> 02:12:50.395
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MANAGE

02:12:50.462 --> 02:12:51.263
SOMETHING IF YOU DON'T MEASURE

02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:51.930
IT.

02:12:51.997 --> 02:12:53.365
SO WE TOOK ALL THE COMPREHENSIVE

02:12:53.432 --> 02:12:56.168
IN YOUR MIND ONE NUMBER THAT WAS

02:12:56.234 --> 02:12:56.868
THAN.

02:12:56.935 --> 02:12:59.137
THE NET UNRESTRICTED POSITION IT

02:12:59.204 --> 02:13:01.306
SHOULD BE NET ASSETS BUT FOR TWO

02:13:01.373 --> 02:13:02.908
THIRDS IT WAS.

02:13:02.974 --> 02:13:04.576
NET DEFICIT.

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:05.310
AND SO -- WE

02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:07.913
HAVE.

02:13:07.979 --> 02:13:09.414
SOME SERIOUS ISSUES FACING.

02:13:09.481 --> 02:13:11.116
THIS LEGISLATURE I BELIEVE IN

02:13:11.183 --> 02:13:12.651
THE FUTURE.

02:13:12.718 --> 02:13:16.655
AND AND AND IF THE OUT OF THE

02:13:16.722 --> 02:13:17.155
NINE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR

02:13:17.222 --> 02:13:20.292
SACRAMENTO CITY PLACED --

02:13:20.359 --> 02:13:20.892
EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN IT'S

02:13:20.959 --> 02:13:22.194
IT'S NEAR THE BOTTOM.

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:23.395
THAT'S BY TAKING THEIR

02:13:23.462 --> 02:13:25.931
UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT AND

02:13:25.997 --> 02:13:27.232
DIVIDING IT BY THEIR POPULATION.

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:29.201
WE DID THE DID THAT FOR ALL THE

02:13:29.267 --> 02:13:31.036
DISTRICT INCLUDING LA UNIFIED

02:13:31.103 --> 02:13:31.937
PRESS TRY TO SEE WERE BEING

02:13:32.003 --> 02:13:34.439
EVERYONE IS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT

02:13:34.506 --> 02:13:35.774
SACRAMENTO CITY.

02:13:35.841 --> 02:13:37.576
AND YOU JUST LOOK AT THE SIZE OF

02:13:37.642 --> 02:13:43.181
THAT OF THE UNRESTRICTED THAT

02:13:43.248 --> 02:13:44.015
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS.

02:13:44.082 --> 02:13:46.118
PLACE THEM SIX FROM THE BOTTOM

02:13:46.184 --> 02:13:48.387
THEY'RE JUST ABOVE FRESNO.

02:13:48.453 --> 02:13:50.322
L. A. U. S. D. SAN DIEGO U. S.

02:13:50.389 --> 02:13:52.724
D. SAN FRANCISCO UST AND LONG

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:54.359
BEACH UST.

02:13:54.426 --> 02:13:56.228
SO WE HAVE A DISTRICT LIKE LA

02:13:56.294 --> 02:13:57.929
UNIFIED WHICH JUST CAME OUT WITH

02:13:57.996 --> 02:13:59.231
THEIR COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL

02:13:59.297 --> 02:14:01.933
FINANCIAL REPORT FOR JUNE.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:02.901
THIRTY EIGHTEEN THEY HAD TO PUT

02:14:02.968 --> 02:14:04.870
ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET FIFTEEN

02:14:04.936 --> 02:14:06.138
BILLION DOLLARS [inaudible]

02:14:06.204 --> 02:14:10.175

02:14:10.242 --> 02:14:11.643

THAT'S MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR

02:14:13.712 --> 02:14:16.648
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT.

02:14:16.715 --> 02:14:18.183
SO WE'VE GOT SOME SERIOUS ISSUES

02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:19.217
WE CAN LOOK.

02:14:19.284 --> 02:14:21.353
AT ONE DISTRICT AND IT'S ALREADY

02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:22.988

BEEN IN THE PAST TWO ENTITIES

02:16:47.365 --> 02:16:48.867
THAT ARE IN THE MIDST OF TRYING

02:16:48.934 --> 02:16:50.201
TO DEAL WITH THEIR BUDGET.

02:16:50.268 --> 02:16:51.436
SITUATION AND TRYING TO MAKE

02:16:51.503 --> 02:16:53.271
CUTS AND ONE THING THAT MY

02:16:53.338 --> 02:16:55.006
OFFICE CAN DO IS AS MR MCCARTY

02:16:55.073 --> 02:16:56.541
INDICATED HE'S ASKED US TO LOOK

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:57.776
AT FIVE YEARS.

02:16:57.842 --> 02:16:59.978
SO WE CAN START BY LOOKING FIVE

02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:01.580
YEARS AGO GIVE US YOUR BUDGET

02:17:01.646 --> 02:17:05.250
YOUR KAFIRS FROM A FEW YEARS AGO

02:17:05.317 --> 02:17:06.017
AND STAFF CAN BE DOING ANALYSIS

02:17:06.084 --> 02:17:06.351
ON THAT WORK.

02:17:06.418 --> 02:17:07.619
AND NOT REALLY FOCUSING ON THE

02:17:07.686 --> 02:17:08.853
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THAT THE

02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:10.188
DISTRICT IS TRYING TO DEAL WITH

02:17:10.255 --> 02:17:12.390
SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO STAGE OUR

02:17:12.457 --> 02:17:14.326
WORK SO TO SPEAK --

02:17:14.392 --> 02:17:15.961
TO AVOID ANY INTERFERENCE WITH

02:17:16.027 --> 02:17:17.562
WHAT THE DISTRICT IS ATTEMPTING

02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:19.464
TO DO AT THIS TIME --

02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:20.398
BUT MR DEEP THERE.

02:17:20.465 --> 02:17:22.100
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OUR AUDITS

02:17:22.167 --> 02:17:24.069
WOULD NOT HAVE ANY --

02:17:24.135 --> 02:17:26.037
NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS ON ANY

02:17:26.104 --> 02:17:27.472
FUTURE DECISIONS RELATED TO THE

02:17:27.539 --> 02:17:29.541
DISTRICT AS FAR AS THE DISTRICT

02:17:29.608 --> 02:17:32.143
BEING TAKEN OVER IF IT IN FACT

02:17:32.210 --> 02:17:33.211
ENDS UP BEING INSOLVENT LATER

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:34.045
THIS YEAR.

02:17:34.112 --> 02:17:36.681
EARLIER YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT --

02:17:36.748 --> 02:17:39.384
IT WOULD.

02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:40.585
HOW LONG IS THAT IN TERMS OF

02:17:40.652 --> 02:17:42.954
LIKE WEEKS AND MONTHS A TWENTY

02:17:43.021 --> 02:17:44.556
FOUR HUNDRED OUR AUDIT WILL TAKE

02:17:44.623 --> 02:17:46.057
US ABOUT SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE?

02:17:46.124 --> 02:17:48.159
BASED ON A A TYPICAL AUDIT TEAM

02:17:48.226 --> 02:17:50.428
NOW ONE THING WE WILL DO AND THE

02:17:50.495 --> 02:17:50.996
SENATE OR BOARD JUST ASK THE

02:17:51.062 --> 02:17:52.097
QUESTION.

02:17:52.163 --> 02:17:53.732
SOME OF THE AUDITS THAT THE

02:17:53.798 --> 02:17:55.600
SUPERINTENDENT REFERRED --

02:17:55.667 --> 02:17:57.035
TO OUR AUDITS OF PROBABLY THE

02:17:57.102 --> 02:17:58.970
MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR SO FOR

02:17:59.037 --> 02:18:00.972
EXAMPLE I THINK HE MENTIONED

02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:03.775
CROW THEY'RE ISSUING AN AUDIT --

02:18:03.842 --> 02:18:06.378
OR AN OPINION ESSENTIALLY ON THE

02:18:06.444 --> 02:18:10.649
DISTRICTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS --

02:18:10.715 --> 02:18:11.282
FOR SIX SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THEY

02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:12.283
ISSUED THAT THAT OUGHT SO THAT'S

02:18:12.350 --> 02:18:14.085
A ONE YEAR LOOK THE FEDERAL

02:18:14.152 --> 02:18:16.054
COMPLIANCE WORK THAT HE REFERRED

02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:17.188
TO THAT'S TYPICALLY LOOKING AT

02:18:17.255 --> 02:18:18.723
THE MOST RECENT YEAR.

02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:20.492
USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND MAKING

02:18:20.558 --> 02:18:21.993
SURE THAT THE THE USE OF THOSE

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.561
FUNDS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

02:18:23.628 --> 02:18:24.696
FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS IT WOULDN'T

02:18:24.763 --> 02:18:26.765
NECESSARILY LOOK AT WHY WAS

02:18:26.831 --> 02:18:28.600
THERE FEDERAL MONEY LEFT ON THE

02:18:28.667 --> 02:18:29.167
TABLE WHY WAS THERE FEDERAL

02:18:29.234 --> 02:18:30.935
MONEY RESEARCH RETURN BACK TO

02:18:31.002 --> 02:18:31.736
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:18:31.803 --> 02:18:33.672
SO THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THE WORK

02:18:33.738 --> 02:18:35.473
THAT MR MCCARTY IS ASKING US TO

02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:37.275
DO THAT ARE VERY SEPARATE AND

02:18:37.342 --> 02:18:39.277
DISTINCT FROM WHAT HAS CURRENTLY

02:18:39.344 --> 02:18:39.844
BEEN DONE.

02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:41.046
BY SOME OF THE ENTITIES A

02:18:41.112 --> 02:18:42.814
SUPERINTENDENT MENTIONED AND I

02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:44.482
THINK ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IS

02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:45.984
LOOKING AT A FIVE YEAR WINDOW

02:18:46.051 --> 02:18:47.252
AND AGAIN WE WILL DO EVERYTHING

02:18:47.318 --> 02:18:48.720
WE CAN TO ALLOW THE DISTRICT TO

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:49.654
CONDUCT.

02:18:49.721 --> 02:18:51.122
THE WORK IT NEEDS TO DO TRY TO

02:18:51.189 --> 02:18:51.990
RIGHT THE SHIP IN THE NEXT

02:18:52.057 --> 02:18:53.491
COUPLE OF MONTHS --

02:18:53.558 --> 02:18:55.493
AND WE CAN START BY LOOKING AT

02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:58.296
PRIOR YEARS --

02:18:58.363 --> 02:19:00.899
SO THAT WE WE DO ALLOW THE THEY

02:19:00.965 --> 02:19:02.167
NEED TO MAKE.

02:19:02.233 --> 02:19:03.568
HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS QUESTIONS

02:19:03.635 --> 02:19:05.437
MEMBERS HAD THANK YOU THANK YOU

02:19:05.503 --> 02:19:06.538

02:19:06.604 --> 02:19:08.306
YOUR COMMENTS AND SENSITIVITY

02:19:08.373 --> 02:19:09.074
AROUND --

02:30:27.952 --> 02:30:29.153
THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR WHO

02:30:29.220 --> 02:30:30.621
I DON'T BELIEVE WAS THE MYSTERY

02:30:30.688 --> 02:30:31.922
DIRECTOR AT THE TIME APPEARED IN

02:30:31.989 --> 02:30:33.657

REGULATIONS THAT ARE FAIR AND

02:30:40.131 --> 02:30:41.732
EQUITABLE TO THE INJURED WORKER

IN THE QUEUE AMIS.

02:30:42.833 --> 02:30:44.402
WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT.

02:30:44.468 --> 02:30:45.636
BUT ONE THING THAT THAT I WAS

02:30:45.703 --> 02:30:46.604
HAPPY TO NOTICE THERE'S NO

02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:48.806
DISPUTE AS TO WHY THIS AUDIT

02:30:48.873 --> 02:30:49.473
SHOULD TAKE PLACE AND THERE'S NO

02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:50.574
DISPUTE.

02:30:50.641 --> 02:30:52.343
THAT AN AUDIT SHOULD TAKE PLACE

02:30:52.410 --> 02:30:53.144
BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:54.779
DIRECTOR AT THE END OF HIS

02:30:54.845 --> 02:30:56.080
LETTER HAS SAID.

02:30:56.147 --> 02:30:59.550
HE WILL FULLY COMPLY AND COOPER

02:30:59.617 --> 02:31:01.218
AND ANY REVIEW AND THE ONLY

02:31:01.285 --> 02:31:02.253
THING HE ****.

02:31:02.319 --> 02:31:04.789
IF THIS COMMITTEE WOULD ALSO

02:31:04.855 --> 02:31:06.223
RECOMMEND THAT THE AUDITOR.

02:31:06.290 --> 02:31:08.459
LOOK AT FRAUD ON THE QB'S PART

02:31:08.526 --> 02:31:09.727
WHICH PERSONALLY.

02:31:09.794 --> 02:31:11.695
NO OBJECTION TO BECAUSE IF THERE

02:31:11.762 --> 02:31:13.764
IS FRAUD AND CUMAE SYSTEM.

02:31:13.831 --> 02:31:14.365
ABSOLUTELY THAT CAN BE PART OF

02:31:14.432 --> 02:31:15.299
THE AUDIT.

02:31:15.366 --> 02:31:16.700
BUT IT IS UNDERSTOOD IT IS

02:31:16.767 --> 02:31:18.636
UNCONTESTED.

02:31:18.702 --> 02:31:20.204
BY EVEN ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR

02:31:20.271 --> 02:31:21.238
BECAUSE HE SAYS HE WILL FULLY

02:31:21.305 --> 02:31:22.373
COOPERATE.

02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:23.974
SO LET'S GET THIS AUDIT LET'S

02:31:24.041 --> 02:31:24.842
FIND OUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON

02:31:24.909 --> 02:31:26.811
BECAUSE I SERVE PUBLIC RECORDS

02:31:26.877 --> 02:31:29.713

I HARDLY GOT ANYTHING AND NOW I

02:31:32.016 --> 02:31:33.617

IN THIS SHIFT IN THE WAY

02:36:54.271 --> 02:36:54.738
TOTALLY INADEQUATE FOR OUR

THE CUE I MEANS FROM AN AREA OF

02:37:52.062 --> 02:37:53.197
Q. AMIS REVIEW.

02:37:53.263 --> 02:37:54.631
THIS INCREASED LITIGATION IN OUR

02:37:54.698 --> 02:37:56.500
SYSTEM MAY BE AT THE HEART OF

02:37:56.567 --> 02:37:58.402
THIS PROBLEM REGARDLESS AS I SAY

02:37:58.468 --> 02:37:59.570
ALL THESE FACTORS NEED TO BE

02:37:59.636 --> 02:38:03.240
CONSIDERED WE WILL CERTAINLY A

02:38:03.307 --> 02:38:04.541
SYSTEM EXAMINING THIS MATTER.

02:38:04.608 --> 02:38:05.175
THE TAUGHT THERE IS TALK OF THE

02:38:05.242 --> 02:38:06.109

CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF

02:38:07.578 --> 02:38:09.446
REVISING THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE

02:38:09.513 --> 02:38:10.113
SCHEDULE.

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:11.882
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE

02:38:11.949 --> 02:38:13.116
WHAT IS REASONABLE AND WHAT IS

02:38:13.183 --> 02:38:14.418
NOT GIVEN ALL OF OUR

02:38:14.484 --> 02:38:15.819
STAKEHOLDERS IN THE SYSTEM BUT

02:38:15.886 --> 02:38:17.321
WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING

02:38:17.387 --> 02:38:18.755
THAT WE HELD STAKEHOLDER

02:38:18.822 --> 02:38:20.324
MEETINGS LAST OCTOBER.

02:38:20.390 --> 02:38:21.225
WE RECEIVED PROPOSALS FROM STAY

02:38:21.291 --> 02:38:25.095
CALL THE SCHEDULE IN DECEMBER

02:38:25.162 --> 02:38:26.530
AND WE ANTICIPATE IN THE NEXT

02:38:26.597 --> 02:38:27.631
MONTH WE'LL CONDUCTING

02:38:27.698 --> 02:38:28.999
ADDITIONAL MEETINGS SO THAT WE

02:38:29.066 --> 02:38:30.968
CAN REACH THAT REASONABLE

02:38:31.034 --> 02:38:32.736
REASONABLE COMPENSATION FOR THE

02:38:32.803 --> 02:38:34.238
PHYSICIANS IN OUR SYSTEM WHO DO

02:38:34.304 --> 02:38:35.806
THESE EVALUATIONS.

02:38:35.873 --> 02:38:37.274
THE RAND CORPORATION HAS

02:38:37.341 --> 02:38:39.042
REVIEWED OUR FEE SCHEDULE AND

02:38:39.109 --> 02:38:40.878
FOUND IT TO BE ADEQUATE AND IN

02:38:40.944 --> 02:38:42.212
LINE WITH OTHER STATES.

02:38:42.279 --> 02:38:44.181
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHATEVER WE

02:38:44.248 --> 02:38:45.983
DO MOVING FORWARD IN THIS AREA

02:38:46.049 --> 02:38:47.718
THAT THE RULES ARE CLEAR AND THE

02:38:47.784 --> 02:38:49.386
TYPES OF MEDICAL REPORTS THAT

02:38:49.453 --> 02:38:50.554
NEED TO BE SUBMITTED.

02:38:50.621 --> 02:38:52.389
IS VERY VERY OBVIOUS TO THE

02:38:52.456 --> 02:38:53.724
PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE

02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:55.058
PROCESS.

02:38:55.125 --> 02:38:56.760
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY VERY

02:38:56.827 --> 02:38:57.628
IMPORTANTLY --

02:38:57.694 --> 02:38:59.429
PHYSICIANS GET PAID FOR THE WORK

02:38:59.496 --> 02:39:00.230
THEY DO.

02:39:00.297 --> 02:39:01.498
I LOOK FORWARD TO INITIATING

02:39:01.565 --> 02:39:02.900
FORMAL RULE MAKING ON THIS

02:39:02.966 --> 02:39:04.201
PROCESS IN THE YEAR AND HAVING

02:39:04.268 --> 02:39:06.970
THIS INEFFECTIVE FAIRLY SOON.

02:39:07.037 --> 02:39:09.072
WHILE I CAN'T SAY I CERTAINLY

02:39:09.139 --> 02:39:10.007
CAN'T SAY THAT I AGREE WITH

02:39:10.073 --> 02:39:11.842
SEVERAL THE ASSERTIONS MADE IN

02:39:11.909 --> 02:39:13.143
THIS AUDIT REPORT IN THIS AUDIT

02:39:13.210 --> 02:39:15.145

SOME OF OUR THAT THE THAT WE MAY

02:39:17.014 --> 02:39:18.649
BE SOMEHOW CONSPIRING WITH THE

02:39:18.715 --> 02:39:20.050
INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

02:39:20.117 --> 02:39:21.285
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT DEBATING

02:39:21.351 --> 02:39:23.086
THESE POINTS WILL TAKE US TO THE

02:39:23.153 --> 02:39:24.922
SOLUTIONS ARE SYSTEM NEEDS. TO

02:39:24.988 --> 02:39:26.757

02:41:07.157 --> 02:41:09.192
FACTORS AT PLAY --

02:41:09.259 --> 02:41:11.695

BACKLOG WITH RESPECT TO WORKERS

02:41:13.697 --> 02:41:15.799
COMP IT'S ALREADY TOUGH ENOUGH

02:41:15.866 --> 02:41:17.200
AS IT IS IS NOT A GOOD THING.

02:41:17.267 --> 02:41:18.502
IN YOUR JUDGMENT DO YOU THINK

02:41:18.568 --> 02:41:19.936
THIS AUDIT COULD HAVE THE

02:41:20.003 --> 02:41:21.204
POTENTIAL TO HELP THAT.

THAT BACK ON GAINES POSSIBLE

02:41:27.544 --> 02:41:28.478
THAT COULD HAPPEN.

02:41:28.545 --> 02:41:30.013
I THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBLE COULD

02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:30.847
HAPPEN -- I

02:41:30.914 --> 02:41:32.182
THINK TAKING A LOOK AT THE

02:41:32.249 --> 02:41:33.917
SYSTEM -- IT

02:41:33.984 --> 02:41:35.652

02:41:35.719 --> 02:41:37.287

02:41:38.989 --> 02:41:39.623
CHANGING.

02:41:39.689 --> 02:41:40.991
THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE IS

02:41:41.058 --> 02:41:42.592
CHANGING THE NATURE OF THE

02:41:42.659 --> 02:41:44.528
DISPUTES IN WORKERS COMPENSATION

02:41:44.594 --> 02:41:45.829

YEARS AND SO I THINK IT'S I

02:41:47.431 --> 02:41:48.799
THINK IT'S ALWAYS HEALTHY TO

02:41:48.865 --> 02:41:50.200
LOOK AT THE PROCESSES WE HAVE.

02:41:50.267 --> 02:41:51.334
AND SEE WHAT KIND OF

02:41:51.401 --> 02:41:52.669
RECOMMENDATIONS WHAT

02:41:52.736 --> 02:41:54.471
OBSERVATIONS CAN BE MADE BY A

02:41:54.538 --> 02:41:56.173
NEUTRAL OBSERVER --

02:41:56.239 --> 02:41:59.042
MAYBE MAYBE THAT WILL TAKE US TO

02:41:59.109 --> 02:42:01.111
A GOOD PLACE OKAY THANKS.

CHANGING NATURE OF THE PRACTICE

02:42:10.253 --> 02:42:11.321
OF MEDICINE.

02:42:11.388 --> 02:42:13.323
AND PHYSICIANS WHO WERE COMING

02:42:13.390 --> 02:42:14.658
OUT OF RESIDENCY PROGRAMS.

02:42:14.724 --> 02:42:16.226
TEND TO MIGRATE TO THE LARGER

02:42:16.293 --> 02:42:17.561
GROUP PRACTICES.

02:42:17.627 --> 02:42:20.530
AND NOT TO THE SMALL A GROUP

02:42:20.597 --> 02:42:22.199
PRACTICES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

02:42:22.265 --> 02:42:23.500
PAST.

02:42:23.567 --> 02:42:25.469
SO GIVEN THAT IF IF I'M RIGHT

WE BOTH ARE.

02:42:28.238 --> 02:42:29.206

02:42:43.220 --> 02:42:46.723
THAT'S ONE THING I WILL SAY IS

02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:47.824
THAT THE DIVISION HAS NEVER

02:42:47.891 --> 02:42:50.093

03:12:11.586 --> 03:12:13.121
BOTH EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE IN

03:12:13.188 --> 03:12:14.656
REDUCING GAS EMISSIONS BUT

03:12:14.723 --> 03:12:16.157
PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE NOT SO

03:12:16.224 --> 03:12:17.525
THE STATE COULD MAKE INFORMED

03:15:31.152 --> 03:15:32.220
MORE WORK AHEAD OF US

03:15:32.287 --> 03:15:34.155
APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF

PARTICULATES.

03:15:43.364 --> 03:15:44.833
IS TOO HIGH ESPECIALLY IN

03:15:44.899 --> 03:15:46.401

AND TO THE MAIN POINTS RAISED IN

03:15:53.408 --> 03:15:53.608
LA -- THIS

03:15:53.675 --> 03:15:54.409
REPORT.

03:15:54.476 --> 03:15:55.777
THE REPORT WAS DRIVEN BY

SPECIFIC LEGISLATION IS NOTED AB

03:15:58.913 --> 03:15:59.347
THREE NINETY EIGHT WHICH

03:15:59.414 --> 03:16:00.682
DIRECTED LA --

03:16:00.748 --> 03:16:02.350
TO LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS

DOES NOT CONSIDER THE OTHER

03:16:10.959 --> 03:16:13.728
STATE GRAMS THE FOCUS ON

03:16:13.795 --> 03:16:15.563

03:16:26.608 --> 03:16:27.809
BY APPROACHING THE REPORT FROM A

03:16:27.876 --> 03:16:30.478
PURE GHG FOCUS THE LA --

03:16:30.545 --> 03:16:32.680
REPORT CONCLUDES THAT THE STATE

03:16:32.747 --> 03:16:34.549
SHOULD BE RELYING MORE ON CAP

03:16:34.616 --> 03:16:37.519
AND TRADE FOR CHEATING GHG GOALS.

03:16:37.585 --> 03:16:38.786
THIS APPROACH MISSIONS MISSES

03:16:38.853 --> 03:16:40.855
THE OTHER KEY DRIVERS REGARDING

03:16:40.922 --> 03:16:42.524
OUR TRANSPORTATION STRATEGIES

03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:44.025
THE NEED TO REDUCE KNOCKS

03:16:44.092 --> 03:16:44.759
EMISSIONS.

03:16:44.826 --> 03:16:47.729
AND TOXIC POLLUTANTS IN SHORT.

03:16:47.795 --> 03:16:49.364
THE FOCUS FOR PROGRAMS IS MUCH

03:16:49.430 --> 03:16:50.698
MORE DIVERSE.

03:16:50.765 --> 03:16:52.433
AND THE PACKAGE OF POLICIES THAT

03:16:52.500 --> 03:16:54.035
WE PUT TOGETHER IS BASED ON AN

03:16:54.102 --> 03:16:56.171
ANALYSIS OF THE MOST COST

03:16:56.237 --> 03:16:57.839
EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE.

03:16:57.906 --> 03:16:59.107
EMISSIONS TO CHEAPER FEDERAL

03:16:59.174 --> 03:17:00.875
MANDATES STATE REQUIRED

STATUTORY PROGRAMS ENERGY THE

03:17:02.710 --> 03:17:06.748
STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

03:17:06.814 --> 03:17:06.948
GOALS.

03:17:07.015 --> 03:17:07.682
FURTHER.

03:17:07.749 --> 03:17:08.249
THE PLANS ARE HOLISTICALLY

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.

03:17:11.286 --> 03:17:13.087
AS WELL AS THE SCOPING PLAN.

03:17:13.154 --> 03:17:14.088
ANOTHER KEY POINT IS TO

03:17:14.155 --> 03:17:15.723
UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

03:17:15.790 --> 03:17:17.792
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO MEETING

03:17:17.859 --> 03:17:19.827
OUR AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE

03:17:19.894 --> 03:17:21.896
GOALS SPECIFICALLY.

03:17:21.963 --> 03:17:23.031
THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IN

03:17:23.097 --> 03:17:25.600
CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS 40% OF OUR

03:17:25.667 --> 03:17:28.703
GHG EMISSIONS. 80% OF OUR KNOCKS

03:17:28.770 --> 03:17:30.104
EMISSIONS.

03:17:30.171 --> 03:17:32.874
AND ABOUT 95% OF OUR DIESEL PM

03:17:32.941 --> 03:17:35.143
EMISSIONS THE SECTOR CONSISTS OF

03:17:35.210 --> 03:17:37.779
OVER THIRTY MILLION CARS TRUCKS.

ACHIEVING EMISSION REDUCTIONS

03:17:45.887 --> 03:17:47.055
MUST CONSIDER.

03:17:47.121 --> 03:17:48.656
THE COSTS AS WELL AS THE

03:17:48.723 --> 03:17:49.824
FEASIBILITY.

03:17:49.891 --> 03:17:51.359
IN SHORT THERE'S NO SINGLE

03:17:51.426 --> 03:17:53.394
SOLUTION WE CANNOT ACHIEVE

03:17:53.461 --> 03:17:55.763
HEALTHIER QUALITY. TO REACH OUR

03:17:55.830 --> 03:17:57.899
CLARA CLIMATE GOALS WITHOUT THE

MULTI PART AIR QUALITY GOALS

03:17:59.367 --> 03:18:01.402
WITHOUT A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH

03:36:42.622 --> 03:36:43.323

03:36:43.390 --> 03:36:44.858
THE IDEA OF AN AUDIT TYPICALLY

03:36:44.925 --> 03:36:46.360
AT LEAST IN MY OPINION.

03:36:46.426 --> 03:36:47.961
IS WHEN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT

03:36:48.028 --> 03:36:49.129
MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE.

03:36:49.196 --> 03:36:51.098
ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS INFORMATION

03:36:51.164 --> 03:36:52.199
FROM THOSE WHO ARE MOST

03:36:52.265 --> 03:36:54.935
KNOWLEDGEABLE HAVE TO RELY UPON.

ALL THE STONES ARE TURNED OVER

03:37:02.376 --> 03:37:03.243
BUT I THINK IN FROM YOUR

03:37:03.310 --> 03:37:04.745
STANDPOINT IT'S NOT THERE YET

03:37:04.811 --> 03:37:06.079
BUT IT MIGHT BE MOVING FORWARD

03:37:06.146 --> 03:37:07.013

WE HAVE THE DIRTIEST AIR IN THE

03:37:31.304 --> 03:37:33.206

03:37:33.273 --> 03:37:35.242
MY DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR IS HIT

03:37:35.308 --> 03:37:36.810
ESPECIALLY HARD [inaudible]

03:39:23.083 --> 03:39:25.018
THEN I WOULD APPRECIATE COPIES

03:39:25.085 --> 03:39:28.021
OF RESPONSES YOU RECEIVED FROM

03:39:28.088 --> 03:39:29.422
CAR --

03:39:29.489 --> 03:39:30.690
TAKING IN.

03:39:30.757 --> 03:39:32.926
THE BIG PICTURE HERE --

03:39:32.993 --> 03:39:35.862
THE WORK OF CAR IS TO CONTINUE

03:39:35.929 --> 03:39:39.699
TO PUSH. FOR PUBLIC HEALTH.

03:39:39.766 --> 03:39:41.668
IN THE BROADER ISSUE IS CLIMATE

03:39:41.735 --> 03:39:43.837
CHANGE AFFECTING THE PLANET.

03:39:43.904 --> 03:39:45.171
CALIFORNIA'S PROVEN TO BE A

03:39:45.238 --> 03:39:46.273
LEADER.

03:39:46.339 --> 03:39:50.010
IN SETTING GREENHOUSE --

03:39:50.076 --> 03:39:52.946
GAS EMISSION REDUCTION.

03:39:53.013 --> 03:39:55.315
TIME TABLES AND YET WE KNOW THE

03:39:55.382 --> 03:39:57.817
IMPACTS IN CHANCES ARE DIFFERENT

03:39:57.884 --> 03:39:59.452
IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES --

03:39:59.519 --> 03:40:03.723
BUT AS PART OF THE ONGOING WORK

03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:05.158
OF CARB --

03:40:05.225 --> 03:40:07.527
THE RESPONSE TO THE EARLIER --

03:40:07.594 --> 03:40:09.996
LA -- REPORT

03:40:10.063 --> 03:40:11.798
AND RECOMMENDATIONS.

03:40:11.865 --> 03:40:14.401
I THINK THE SOLUTION TODAY IN

03:40:14.467 --> 03:40:17.270
AGAIN CONTINGENT UPON.

03:40:17.337 --> 03:40:18.572
THE THOROUGHNESS OF THOSE

03:40:18.638 --> 03:40:20.540
RESPONSES.

03:40:20.607 --> 03:40:22.208
BUT I THINK IT ACTUALLY.

03:40:22.275 --> 03:40:25.245
HAS THE POTENTIAL OF EXPEDITING

03:40:25.312 --> 03:40:27.180
GETTING THIS INFORMATION TO YOU

03:40:27.247 --> 03:40:28.515
AND TO THE COMMITTEE --

03:40:28.582 --> 03:40:30.951
IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM MISTER COREY

03:40:31.017 --> 03:40:32.452
MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION.

03:40:32.519 --> 03:40:33.820
IS.

03:40:33.887 --> 03:40:35.822
EXISTENCE AND IT'S A MATTER OF

03:40:35.889 --> 03:40:39.926
COMPILATION AND MAKING SURE IT'S

03:40:39.993 --> 03:40:41.761
IN IN THE MANNER THAT ADDRESSES

03:40:41.828 --> 03:40:43.263
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

03:40:43.330 --> 03:40:43.830
YOU'VE RAISED.

03:40:43.897 --> 03:40:45.999
BUT WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL HERE I

03:40:46.066 --> 03:40:49.202
THINK OF A WIN WIN OF NOT HAVING.

03:40:49.269 --> 03:40:51.271
TO ABSORB THE COST OF AN ON IT

03:40:51.338 --> 03:40:53.073
THE AUDITOR'S SET UP TO DO THIS

03:40:53.139 --> 03:40:55.241
WORK BUT AS WE KNOW EVERY ON IT

03:40:55.308 --> 03:40:57.177
IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT TAKES

03:40:57.243 --> 03:40:57.944
TIME.

03:40:58.011 --> 03:41:00.747

03:45:21.774 --> 03:45:23.576
THE REPUBLIC TO AT LEAST HAVE A

03:45:23.643 --> 03:45:25.678
DIFFERENT SET OF ICE LOOK AT ALL

03:45:25.745 --> 03:45:26.980
THE PROGRAMS THAT --

03:45:27.046 --> 03:45:28.348
YOU'VE BEEN DOING AND I

03:45:28.414 --> 03:45:29.215
ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE GREAT WORK

03:45:29.282 --> 03:45:31.150

LEADING THE YOUR PROGRAM IF OF

03:45:39.125 --> 03:45:40.894
THE MEAL IF IF EVERYTHING IS

03:45:40.960 --> 03:45:42.662
HUNKY DORY.

03:45:42.729 --> 03:45:43.930
I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION I

03:45:43.997 --> 03:45:46.332
GUESS MY FIRST RESPONSE WAS THAT

03:45:46.399 --> 03:45:47.767
AS I LOOKED AT THE QUESTION THE

03:45:47.834 --> 03:45:48.735
NATIONAL QUESTIONS I SAW NOT

03:45:48.801 --> 03:45:50.103
THESE ARE NEW ONES BUT I BELIEVE

03:45:50.169 --> 03:45:51.638
WE CAN BE EQUALLY RESPONSIVE TO

03:45:51.704 --> 03:45:53.139
THEM.

03:45:53.206 --> 03:45:54.774
MY RESPONSE WAS IF ONE

03:45:54.841 --> 03:45:56.476
CONSIDERED THE DATA THAT'S

03:45:56.542 --> 03:45:58.211
ALREADY OUT THERE THROUGH A

03:45:58.278 --> 03:46:00.046
SERIES OF LEGISLATIVE REPORTS

03:46:00.113 --> 03:46:01.915
ACTUALLY SO MIDDLE SOME OF WHICH

03:46:01.981 --> 03:46:04.417
ARE ANNUAL AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC

03:46:04.484 --> 03:46:05.818
PROCESS WE GO THROUGH.

03:46:05.885 --> 03:46:07.854
THAT WAS MY MAIN POINT WAS.

03:46:07.921 --> 03:46:09.188
THE INFORMATION'S IN THERE SO I

03:46:09.255 --> 03:46:11.024
COULDN'T HELP BUT ASK WHAT IS

03:46:11.090 --> 03:46:13.226
THE OBJECTIVE OF THE AUDIT GOT

03:46:13.293 --> 03:46:13.626
IT.

03:46:13.693 --> 03:46:15.328
AND AND AND AND ASK YOU THAT

03:46:15.395 --> 03:46:17.897
BECAUSE THIS IS ITEM NUMBER --

03:46:17.964 --> 03:46:19.799
EIGHT IN IN A VERY LONG --

03:46:19.866 --> 03:46:23.436

OF RAISING COSTS AS AS A ISSUES

03:46:33.279 --> 03:46:35.615
AND AND I THINK THAT ALL THESE

03:46:35.682 --> 03:46:36.983
REQUESTS ARE PRETTY BIPARTISAN

03:46:37.050 --> 03:46:40.987
WHERE I EVEN EVEN MEMBERS ON THE

03:46:41.054 --> 03:46:42.655
