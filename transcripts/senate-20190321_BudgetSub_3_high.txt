WE REGULATE MORE THAN 96% OF THE COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT HEALTH COVERAGE IN THE STATE. ARE PROPOSED TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE AUTHORIZED POSITIONS THE DEPARTMENT IS SPECIALLY FUNDED THROUGH ASSESSMENTS ON HEALTH PLANS AND WE RECEIVE NO GENERAL FUND MONEY. A FEW PROGRAMS I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST AS OUR HELP CENTER THAT HELPS. CONSUMERS -- WE EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THEIR HEALTHCARE RIGHTS WE HELP THEM RESOLVE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS SEMI HELP THEM NAVIGATE AND UNDERSTAND THEIR COVERAGE AND ENSURE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WE IT SINCE TWO THOUSAND WE HAVE ASSISTED MORE THAN TWO POINT ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS -- I SHOULD MENTION ALSO THAT WE ADMINISTER THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL YOU PROGRAM AS WELL. OUR OFFICE OF PLAN LICENSING -- RICK -- REVIEWS ALL OF THE APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE FROM HEALTH PLANS AND ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS INCLUDING BENEFITS AND COVERAGE CONTRACTS WITH THE DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS AND PROVIDER NETWORKS AND COMPLAINT AND GRIEVANCE SYSTEMS. OUR OFFICE OF PLAN MONITORING -- HAS TWO DIVISIONS ONE THAT CONDUCTS -- SURVEYS OF HEALTH PLANS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE OPERATIONALLY -- ABLE. TO ENSURE THAT THEY MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND CARE.

SELL ANY QUESTIONS ON THE OVERVIEW. NO I THINK -- ALSO WE CAN AND I THINK WITH SOME QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE TIMELY ACCESS REPORT FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND PUSHES AND DRUG COSTS TRANSPARENCY REPORT FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO CAN GO OVER SOME OF THOSE -- FINDINGS WE HAD A TWO THANK YOU -- SO WITH RESPECT TO TIMELY ACCESS PASSED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPLEMENT MORE STRINGENT OVERSIGHT OF HEALTH PLANS COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS MEANT TO ENSURE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE. THE REGULATION WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN TWENTY TEN INCLUDE SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES UNDER WHICH AND RELEASE MUST BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CARE. THESE STANDARDS INCLUDE WAIT TIMES FOR URGENT AND NON URGENT CARE APPOINTMENTS AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF TELEPHONE TRIAGE OR SCREENING SERVICES DURING AND AFTER REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS. SO TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS HEALTH PLAN SUBMIT ANNUAL COMPLIANCE REPORTS TO THE DEPARTMENT -- IN DECEMBER WE RELEASED OUR MEASUREMENT YOUR TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT ON THE HEALTH PLAN DATA. OF THE AGENDA ITEM DESCRIPTION SUMMARIZES THE KEY FINDINGS FROM THE PORT SO I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT THEM HERE BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM I'M HAPPY -- TO RESPOND -- SO FOR MEASUREMENT YOUR TWENTY SEVENTEEN HEALTH PLANS CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE AND DATA ACCURACY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS MEASUREMENT YEARS. THIS ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO DISPLAY MORE DETAILED DATA INITIAL C. ON THE REPORT WE HAVE THIRTY SIX CHARTS AND YOU KNOW THAT BREAK DOWN THE DATE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. THAT SAID WE STILL SEE SOME ERRORS IN THE DATA WHICH WE ARE WORKING WITH THE HEALTH PLANS TO CORRECT -- I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT PROVIDING TIMELY ACCESS IS ONE OF THE PLANTS FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES TO ITS ENROLLEES. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THE DEPARTMENT TAKES THIS ROLE VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE WILL. CONTINUE TO OVERSEE AND MONITOR THE PLANS AND TAKEN FORSMAN ACTION WHERE NECESSARY. TO THAT END WE ENGAGE IN MANY ACTIVITIES TO THAT THEY CAN MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. AND THESE INCLUDE ANALYZING THE HEALTH PLANS ANNUAL REPORTS THAT DETAIL THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TIME LAPSE STANDARDS. TRACKING AND REALLY COMPLAINTS SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT AND HELPING AND RELEASE OBTAIN TIMELY CARE. ANNUALLY EVALUATING NUMEROUS HEALTH PLAN NETWORKS IN THE COMMERCIAL INDIVIDUAL AND MEDI CAL -- LINES OF BUSINESS. BUT IN HEALTH PLAN OPERATIONS THROUGH ROUTINE MEDICAL SURVEYS. ENSURING HEALTH PLANS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFER ENROLLEES AND ENSURE ACCESS TO CARE WHEN CONTRACTS BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS TERMINATE. AND AS I SAID TAKING ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST HEALTH PLANS OF VIOLATE THE TIMELY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN THE DEPARTMENT HAS LEVIED SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN PENALTIES. AGAINST SIXTY FIVE HEALTH PLANS FOR FAILURE TO MEET THE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE BOTH IN SPECIFIC INSTANCES AND WHERE WE HAVE FOUND PATTERNS OF ACCESS PROBLEMS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. DO I TOUCH ON THE PRESCRIPTIONS MARK IS GOING TO DO THE PROTECTION TRY. AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL HAVE FUN DON'T THEY QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS AGAIN MY NAME IS MARTY GREEN CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. SO DAMAGE SEE IN THE END OF DECEMBER DID RELEASE IT OUR FIRST REPORT UNDER SB SEVENTEEN THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS TRANSPARENCY. AS A REMINDER IT REQUIRED HEALTH PLANS TO REPORT TO THE DAMAGE SEAT THE TWENTY FIVE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS. THE TWENTY FIVE MOST COSTLY DRUGS BY TOTAL ANNUAL PLAN SPENDING AND TWENTY FIVE DRUGS WITH THE HIGHEST YOUR EVERY YEAR IT ANNUAL INCREASE IN TOTAL ANNUAL PLAN SPENDING -- IT DID SB SEVENTEEN HAD A NUMBER OF OTHER REQUIREMENTS ON DRUG MANUFACTURERS BUT THEY DO NOT INVOLVE OUR DEPARTMENT THEY INVOLVE A SISTER DEPARTMENT. SO WE ARE REQUIRED UNDER SB SEVENTEEN TO SUMMARIZE THE DATA SUBMITTED BY THE HEALTH PLANS AND PUBLISH AN ANNUAL REPORT AND OUR FIRST ONE AS I SAID CAME OUT IN LATE DECEMBER. COUPLE OF LIMITATIONS TO THE REPORT XIN DRUG COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHARMACY BENEFIT UNDER THE HEALTH PLAN IT DOES NOT INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS FOR INPATIENT DRUGS IS ADMINISTERED IN A HOSPITAL. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS OR PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BORNE BY DELEGATED ENTITY LIKE A MEDICAL GROUP THAT'S ADMINISTERING DRUGS ON BEHALF OF THE HEALTH PLAN. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR SELF FUNDED ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE NOT REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE OR OTHER PLANS INSURERS IN ORGANIZATIONS ARE REGULATED BY THE DAMAGE CITY. THE REPORT REPRESENTS TWENTY FIVE HEALTH PLANS AND ONE EIGHT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION MEMBER MONTHS WHICH IF YOU ANNUAL AS THAT NUMBER THAT'S APPROXIMATELY TWELVE POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ISSUES A SEPARATE REPORT FOR THOSE BUT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY REGULATE. SOME OF THE KEY FINDINGS HEALTH PLANS PAID NEARLY EIGHT POINT SEVEN BILLION FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE PHARMACY BENEFIT. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ACCOUNTED FOR THIRTEEN POINT 1% OF TOTAL HEALTH PLANS ARE PREMIUMS AND MANUFACTURE DRUG REBATES EQUALED NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION OR ABOUT TEN POINT 5% OF THE EIGHT POINT SEVEN BILLION SPENT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND WHILE SPECIALTY DRUGS ACCOUNTED FOR ONE POINT 6% OF ALL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THEY ACCOUNTED FOR OVER HALF OR FIFTY ONE POINT 5% OF TOTAL ANNUAL SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. FOR THE TWENTY FIVE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS ENROLLEES PAID APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE COST OF SPECIALTY DRUGS AND OVER HALF OR FIFTY SIX POINT THANK YOU -- COMES FROM ELIA [inaudible] RIGHT FINANCE. COMMITTEE MEMBER COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT TIME SO. THAT RESULT THANK YOU I DIRECTOR LARD FOR FOR BEING HERE AND ALSO -- APPRECIATE THE THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT OUR HEALTH CARE DEPARTMENTS HEALTH CARE -- PERFORMS BECAUSE BASICALLY WHEN PEOPLE PURCHASE INSURANCE -- THE PROMISES ARE MADE RIGHT -- AND AND US SOMETIMES IF THEY'RE NOT BEING THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE -- THE DEPARTMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE SURE THAT. NOT THAT THOSE PROMISES ARE KEPT AND AS CONSEQUENCES FOR FOR WHEN WHEN THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TIMELY ACCESS BECAUSE VIEW. WHAT'S THE USE OF THE INSURANCE CARD WE CAN'T FIND A DOCTOR AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE YOU NEED THERE AND WHEN THINGS I KNOW THAT I'VE EXPRESSED SOME FRUSTRATION THE PAST -- WAS IS THAT -- I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO COLLECT THE SURVEY DATA OF FORTY THE FIRST ROUND WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA SELL WHEN THERE'S THEN I UNDERSTAND. JOHN THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF TIME AND ALSO RACES YEAH TAKE TIME TO COLLECT THE DATA THEY HAVE TO ANALYZE THE DATA SO WE ALWAYS LOOKING ABOUT TWO YEARS BACK. SO I APPRECIATE THIS IS NOW THE FIRST YEAR WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME GOOD DATA SITE AND SHARING THIS COMMITTEE NOW THIS IS MY THIRD YEAR SO FINALLY WE HAVE SOME GOOD DATA -- WHAT KIND OF PARTICULAR -- INSIGHTS TO CAN YOU SHARE IN TERMS OF HOW THE STATE IS GOING TO HELP YOU AND FORCE THE THE THE THE THE TIMELY ACCESS RULES. IT'S GONNA BE BETTER INFORMED THEIR CHANGE THE APPROACHES THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE IN TERMS OF FEATURE WE IN. FOR AND FORCE THE THE ASSEMBLY ACCESS RULES -- NOW THAT WE HAVE SOME ACCURATE DATA FROM THE SERVICE. SO WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF OPERATING UNDER AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT WAIVER SO WHEN ARE STILL TWEAKING. THE DIRECTION THAT WE GIVE THE PLANS ON HOW TO DO -- THE TIMELY ACTS AT THE SURVEYS -- AND EACH TIME AS I SAID IT GETS BETTER AND BETTER SO -- WE'RE LEARNING A LOT ALONG THIS PROCESS WE'VE WE'VE MADE A LOT OF EFFICIENCIES IN THE WHOLE PROCESS OF COLLECTING THE DATA AND OUR OUR TASK NOW IS TO COME UP WITH WHAT IS A REASONABLE RATE OF COMPLIANCE THAT WE CAN -- THAT THE PLANTS CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S AND THAT WE CAN-ENFORCE AGAINST AND WHEN I TALK ABOUT IN FORCE NINETEEN ENFORCING IN A COURT OF LAW BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE. TO PROVE THAT THE PLANS HAVE DONE SOMETHING I'M SAID THAT. SO THAT IS OUR CHARGE THIS YEAR WE NEED TO HAVE A REGULATION -- BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND WE WERE WORKING ON DRAFTING THAT -- WE'VE INVOLVED A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS PROCESS -- A LOT OF FEEDBACK AND INTACT OR SOME AT INDEPENDENT ACTIVITIES GOING ON TO HELP ADVISE US ABOUT WHAT THAT METHODOLOGY SHOULD BE -- AND SO WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD TO MEET OUR TIME FRAMES AND EXPECT TO HAVE A REGULATION READY TO GO AT THE END OF THE YEAR. AND BUT IN TERMS YOUR APPROACH TO HEALTH PLANS THAT -- THAT. OUR MEETING TO TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS I APPRECIATE YOU SHARE WITH US THE SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN IN THE PAST -- WHAT DO YOU SEE IS BEING THE MOST RAPID WAY TO GET I MEAN ULTIMATELY LETS US I MEAN WE CAN AND THEN YOU NEED TO DO THIS YOU KNOW WE HAVE FINES AND OTHER TYPES OF? PUNISHMENTS FOR PEOPLE DOWN -- WHAT'S THE BUT HE SEES THE BEST WAY TO MORE RAPIDLY BE SURE THAT. HEALTH PLANS ARE IN COMPLIANCE AND AND ULTIMATELY THE PATIENTS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED TO ARE THERE OTHER TOOLS THAT YOU SEE NOW WE'VE TALKED A PROVIDER DIRECTORIES AND CONSIDER HOW TO CONSOLIDATE THOSE AND OTHER TYPES OF APPROACHES. ORDER TO WORK AT THINGS YOU'RE LOOKING AT SHOULD YOU HAVE TO GO TAKE THEM TO COURT AND THAT'S ALWAYS TAKE SOMETIME TO HAVE SOMETHING COME OUT SO OFTEN TRYING. WE'RE TRYING TO CHECK ALWAYS PLAYING CATCH UP IN THAT REGARD BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT OTHER TYPES OF APPROACHES MIGHT TAKE -- TO GET THE PLANS TO THAT MEANS BETTER I I PREFER OF THE I'LL JUST FOLLOW THE RULE AND WE'D HAVE TO PUSH ANYBODY SAID. OKAY SO IN NOT THROUGH OUR ANNUAL NETWORK REVIEW PROCESS -- WE DO LOOK AT THAT THE CAPACITY OF THE NETWORK OVERALL AND REALLY BUT THE TIMELY ACCESS -- PROCESS IS MEASURING IS IS THE NETWORK AS A WHOLE ADEQUATE TO SERVE THE ENROLLEES AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT A SPECIFIC PROVIDERS OFFICE. SO -- BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE TIMES WHEN A PROVIDER ISN'T AVAILABLE YET BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW POPULARITY OR CERTAIN KIND OF SPECIALTIES WHATEVER SO AS WE LOOK AT THE NETWORK'S OVERALL WE'RE MEASURING UNLIKE HOW WHAT'S THE CAPACITY OF THE NETWORK TO BE ABLE -- TO INSURE THAT TIMELY ACCESS SO THAT'S ONE THING -- AND WHEN OUR SURVEYS TEAM GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE PLANS PROCESSES FOR HOW THEY EVALUATE NETWORKS THAT'S ANOTHER AREA THAT WE WE ALSO LOOK AT AND SO AS I SAID IN OUR REAL GOAL IS TO GET TO A STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGY AND RATE OF COMPLIANCE THAT. IS UNIFORM AND WE CAN REALLY ENFORCE AGAINST. ALL RIGHT SO IN USE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRY EXPAND AND YEAH -- SAYS HERE AND I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T MISS ARE DIRECTLY OVERSEE THE DTS PLANS WHILE THE CONVERSATION I SEE DIRECTOR CANCER HERE. ABOUT SOME OF THAT WE CERTAINLY WON'T BE SURE ON THE PRIVATE SIDE THAT THAT -- PEOPLE ARE PURCHASING THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA WHO ARE PURCHASING THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER ARE ARE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHATEVER THAT THAT. THAT WE HAVE THE STANDARD. THAT STANDARDS ARE BEING FOLLOWED ABSOLUTELY AND WE LOOK AT EACH OF THE QUESTION ABOUT THE PRESCRIPTION SO THAT THIS VERY INTERESTING DATA. NOW WE EASY MENTION THERE'S A THERE'S A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE THE DATA DOESN'T COME TO YOU AT LEAST FOR YOUR REPORT. CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF HOW. I GUESS REPRESENTATIVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN YOUR REPORT AND OTHER WORDS COMPARED TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE THEY ARE THE SAME ARE THE SICKER OLDER OR WHATEVER ANY DAYS IS IS THERE. AND IS THERE SOME SORT OF A AS THE HOW REPRESENTATIVE IS ANY OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY BUT ALSO YOU KNOW YOU YOU DON'T COUNT YOU SAID YOU'VE. TRIED ALL DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO WOULD BE IN YOUR REPORT -- SO CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF LIKE WHAT WE LOOK AT THIS DATA WHICH WE MIGHT IT BE SKEWED. IT'S GOING TO SKEW TOWARDS THE COMMERCIAL POPULATIONS OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN COMMERCIAL COVERAGE WHICH GENERALLY TEND TO BE THOSE FROM. THE AGE RANGE UP UNTIL MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY WHICH IS OF COURSE SIXTY FIVE SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A GENERALLY SPEAKING. YOU THROUGH WORKING AGE ADULTS -- AND IT WILL SKEW TO A SLIGHTLY HIGHER INCOME BECAUSE THE MEDIC HOW POPULATIONS EXCLUDED SO IT'S GOING TO BE GENERALLY THAT. OF CHILDREN TO WORKING AGE MIDDLE INCOME AND ABOVE GENERALLY SPEAKING OKAY AND IF THEY DO FIND IT INTERESTING WHEN YOU SAID THAT -- SPECIALLY DRUGS. WHICH NOT SURPRISINGLY ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE -- THE REPRESENT ACTUALLY OVER HALF. OF THOSE IT ONLY REPRESENT WHAT ONE POINT 6% OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS AND THEN EACH TRIED DEL THE IDEA OPTING TO DELVE IN THAT LITTLE DEEPER AND SEE HOW -- WHAT TO TO THAT ONE POINT 6% ISN'T? THAT WHAT THEY COME FROM YEAH THE DATE OF THE TIMES TO THE DEPARTMENT ISN'T ENOUGH I THE PATIENTS ARE NON IDENTICAL PATIENTS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHO YEAH SO. NO WE HAD JUST HAVE VOLUME OKAY SO BY PLAN HOW MANY PRESCRIPTIONS WERE FILLED OKAY -- AND THEN THE PER COST PER PRESCRIPTION COST AND SO WE CAN AGGREGATE THAT AND LOOK ACROSS PLANS AND UNDERSTAND. HOW MUCH BOTH WAS SPENT AND HOW MANY PEOPLE RECEIVED ABOUT DORADO BUT WE CAN'T DEL BEGIN WHICH DRUG IT WHICH DRUGS THEY ARE YES AND YOU CAN SEE -- AND THE LESS THAT WE PROVIDE AND ON THE SPECIALTY TEAR WHICH ARE THE ONES ARE IN THE TOP TWENTY FIVE ALL RIGHT. AND I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS I KNOW YOU'RE REGULATORY AGENCY -- WHAT DO YOU SEE ANY -- WELL THAT WHETHER IT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT. THIS INFORMATION MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN TERMS OF POLICY MAKING. I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S HELPFUL I MEAN AS YOU KNOW THE THE GOVERNOR HAS AN INITIATIVE RELATED TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND I'D AND AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACEUTICAL COLLABORATIVE. NOW WE ARE CONSIDERING BOTH OF THE INFORMATION OUR REPORT THE INFORMATION IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE REPORT AS WELL AS PRESCRIPTION DRUG INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM OTHER STATE PURCHASERS ON DIFFERENT WAYS AT THE MINISTRATION CAN APPROACH A REDUCING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS SO I THINK IT IS. USEFUL INFORMATION FOR MANY PARTIES THEN I GUESS THE OTHER FINAL QUESTION ABOUT IT CERTAINLY ON ONE LEVEL OF COURSE WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS -- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE AND THIS IS MY LESS SO WITH THE SPECIALLY DRUGS BUT ALSO THE HOUSE THAT MATCH UP WITH SUPPLY -- SO WHERE YOU MIGHT BE SHORTAGES -- YEAH I THINK MY CONCERN IS IS THAT SOMETIMES -- WELL CERTAINLY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THERE MAY BE. CERTAIN PHARMACEUTICALS WHERE THE COST IS GUNS ARE THE PRICES GOTTEN SO LOW YOU BASICALLY NOW BOIL DOWN TO A SINGLE SUPPLIER. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS THAT SUPPLIER BECOMES A TARGET OF THE HEDGE FUND SOME INVESTORS SOMEONE WHO SEES AN OPPORTUNITY. TO THAT SWOOP AND BUY A CHEAP JACK THE PRICE UP TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT INTO THE PRICING INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO LOOKING AT WHERE MIGHT BE VULNERABILITIES AND LOOKING AT WHERE WE MAY HAVE SHORTAGES AS WELL ALSO WE CAN GET RELIABLE SUPPLY OF THE MEDICATION. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN AS WELL SO HOPING WE CAN LOOK AT BOTH OF THOSE AND BECAUSE IN THE END WHAT WE WANNA DO IS HAVE? YOU KNOW -- MEDICATION THAT SET THE BILL WITH THE RIGHT PRICE. AT ALSO AVAILABLE WHEN YOU NEED IT RIGHT -- SO IF THERE'S A PROBLEM EITHER SIDE AND THERE'S THAT AND THEN PEOPLE ARE BEING SERVED WELL. ABSOLUTELY SO OKAY AND THEY REALIZE THAT THAT FLIES BY BID OUT THE SCOPE OF YOUR AGENCY BUT I'M THINKING THAT THIS INFORMATION MIGHT BE USEFUL THINKING ABOUT WHICH AGENCY WHERE THAT MIGHT BE -- THEY MY MY LOOK AT THAT AND I'LL ABSOLUTELY OKAY ALL RIGHT. YEAH YES AS THEIR STONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. COUPLE QUESTIONS A ABILITY TO HAVE AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS -- WITHIN THEIR PLANS ARE YOU SEEING OKAY SEE ANY SHORTAGES ANNIE ANNIE ABILITIES -- TO NOT PROVIDE SERVICE AND SPECIALLY AND MAYBE SOME OF THE MORE RURAL AREAS. I THINK YOU KNOW EVERYBODY YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A PROVIDER SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT IS MORE ACUTE IN RURAL AREAS -- AND THAT'S WHY THE DEPARTMENT HAS A PROCESS -- FOR APPROVING ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS IF THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THE THE TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS AREN'T. ABLE TO BE MET BECAUSE THERE JUST AREN'T THE PHYSICIANS THERE SO -- THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE LOOK AT WE DO A LOT OF VERY DETAIL GEO DEAL MAPPING ANALYSIS OF WHERE PROVIDERS ARE AND WHERE THE MEMBERS ARE AND HOW WE CAN BEST -- MATCH THEM UP AND ALSO THE PLANS ARE UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE SO IF THERE IS IF THERE ISN'T A SPECIALIST IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA THAT THE SO MANY TO SEE. ANY TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN GET THEM TO A PLACE WHERE THAT THAT PERSON AS OKAY THAT'S COMFORTING TO KNOW -- ALSO IN RE IN RESPONSE TO SB SEVENTEEN OR NEW -- INFORMATION -- READ MS AND DRUG DISCOUNTS -- BUT I DIDN'T SEE A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION ON THAT IN MY REPORT CAN YOU CUT TO LET MEKNOW -- ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN REPORTED TO YOU ABOUT THE COST OF THE PBM ISN'T. IN COMPARISON TO THE REBATES UP AND WHICH RECEIVED THE INFORMATION AS REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED TO US WAS AT WHETHER NOT THEY USE A P. B. M. AND THAT THE NAME OF THE PAY BE ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PDM. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IT'S REFLECTED IN WHATEVER THE NEGOTIATED PRICE IS NOT SEPARATELY FROM SO IT'S YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE IT AS A P. B. M. PRICE PLUS THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES AND SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND. WHICH PLANS ARE CONTRACTING WITH WHICH P. B. M.'S AND THEN SEPARATELY WE DO HAVE THE REBATE INFORMATION WHICH I BRIEFLY WENT OVER THE NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION APPROXIMATELY OKAY. OKAY. YEAH THE THE IN THE KIND OF OPERATING A BLACK BOX I WAS HOPING THAT THROUGH THAT -- THEM THE BILL THAT WE WOULD BEGIN TO SEE SOME OF MORE TRANSPARENCY WITH THE PBM SEND. WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE TAKING OUT OF THE HEALTHCARE MARKET? WE DO HAVE ANOTHER BILL THAT WE'RE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT -- THREE FIFTEEN WHICH IS ABOUT PM TRANSPARENCY AND SO WE JUST RECENTLY SENT OUT A SOLICITATION FOR TASK FORCE THAT'S GOING TO HELP IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL -- INFORMATION THAT WE CAN COLLECT FROM THE HEALTH UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE P. B. M.'S AND THE HEALTHCARE MARKETPLACE IT'S NOT PART OF IT BERMAN AT EMAIL AND SUPPORTED AT NIGHT AND LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE RESULTS AND AGAIN AS FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. RIGHT THANK YOU CENTER STONE -- ACTIVATE BIG INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE -- I RECOGNIZE A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE DOCTOR STUART COLLINS HERE WITH THAT. THE SEVENTH GRADE CLASS HE COULD SEE YOU. AT TELL YOU THIS IS THE MOST INTERESTING COMMITTEE OF ALL. ACTUALLY THIS IS. OKAY -- JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE -- IN TERMS OF I KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND I KNOW THAT YOU ARE REGULATED PLANS AND AND ALSO CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PERHAPS -- WHAT KIND OF WORK YOU DO IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT NOT ONLY PLANS BUT SIR THE SUBCONTRACTS THE ABBEY HAVE WITH MEDICAL GROUPS HOSPITALS AND OTHER? ENTITIES MY COMES THE RISK BEARING. SO AS PART OF OUR LICENSING PROCESS WE LOOK AT BASICALLY TEMPLATE CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE HEALTH PLANS IN THE PROVIDER GROUPS. AND AS ENTITIES MEDICAL GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE I WANT TO COME IN FOR LICENSURE THAN WE DO LOOK AT WHAT THOSE ARRANGEMENTS ARE AND THE RISK THAT'S GOING TO BE PASTOR SHARED WITH THOSE ENTITIES SO. WE HAVE -- REGULATION AS YOU KNOW THAT WAS JUST -- WHEN ENTITIES NEED TO COME IN FOR LICENSURE -- IT INCLUDES AN EXEMPTION PROCESS FOR THOSE ENTITIES THAT DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY MEET THOSE THE DEFINITION ARE THE ROAD FOR THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HEALTH PLANS -- WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER REGULATION IN THE WORKS THAT WOULD ALSO -- IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR WHAT WE CALL RISK BEARING ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE BASICALLY MEDICAL GROUPS THAT TAKE ON RISK -- SO THAT WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THOSE GROUPS THAT ARE TAKING ON RISK AND BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW RISK IS BEING SHARED AND AND ENSURING THAT THE ENTITIES THAT ARE TAKING IT ON ACTUALLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE IT AND NOT -- AND TO DELIVER ON THE CARE THAT THEY NEED TO FOR MEMBERS AND NOT GO. BECOME FINANCIALLY SOLVENT. RIGHT AT THE INTERESTED IN DOES YOU WILL PRESS THIS FALLS ON AND ON HOW THAT SEX IS GOING TO WORK BUT CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT -- IN THE END THE FISHERY WHO PAID THE PREMIUM. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY GET THE CARE THEY NEED RIGHT SO WHATEVER SUBCONTRACTS HAPPEN IT'S A ROAD THAT THEY'RE NOT LEFT STRANDED AND SOMEONE SAYS WELL THAT WAS SUPPOSED BE THAT PERSON'S RESPONSIBILITY THAT GROUP'S RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THEM BUT I PAY MY PREMIUM TO USE THE HEALTH. PLAN SO. WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT THOSE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THE PATIENT IS PROTECTED SO. SHE DAY LOOKING INTO THAT OKAY -- SO LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO IF THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS OKAY SO WE'LL MOVE ON THE ISSUE -- TO SO I WHEN I GET DOUBLE LITTLE MORE INTO SOME THE RESOURCE YOU NEED THE DIVISION OF PLAN SERVICE WORKLOAD. CERTAINLY SO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE KNOX KEEN ACT OUR DIVISION OF PLAN SURVEYS PERFORMS MEDICAL SURVEYS OF LICENSE PLANS TO EVALUATE THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. IT FUNCTIONS MUCH LIKE AN OPERATIONAL AUDIT. IN ADDITION TO PERFORMING ROUTINE SURVEYS -- THE LAW REQUIRES US TO CONDUCT FOLLOW UP SURVEYS AND NON ROUTINE SURVEYS WHEN NECESSARY. A FOLLOW UP SURVEY IS PERFORMED WHEN THERE'S A DEFICIENCY OR DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED IN A ROUTINE SURVEY REPORT AND THEY REMAIN UNCORRECTED AT THE TIME OF THE FINAL REPORT. NON ROUTINE SURVEYS MAYBE PERFORMED WIND DEFICIENCIES REMAIN UNCORRECTED AT THE AGE ISSUE AND SO THE FOLLOW REPORT OR IF THE DEPARTMENT HAS GOOD CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME COMPLIANCE ISSUES. THE NUMBER OF HEALTH PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MEDICAL SURVEYS HAS INCREASED BY 23% SINCE THE NINE NINE TEN FISCAL YEAR. FROM APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED PLANS TO A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE PLANS. IN ADDITION AT THE SAME TIME THE MARKET RATE FOR CLINICAL CONSULTING SERVICES HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. AND AS AS A RESULT OF BOTH OF THOSE FACTORS BOTH MORE PLANS AS WELL AS HIGHER A CLINICAL CONSULTING RATES WE ANTICIPATE A FUNDING SHORTFALL DUE DUE TO THOSE TWO FACTORS. AND IT THERE ARE CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT AND TIMELY WRITING OF REPORTS. SO AS A RESULT WE ARE REQUESTING FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS AND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY IN THE AMOUNT OF TO JUST SHY OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED WORKLOAD AND INCREASE RATES CHARGED BY THE CLINICAL CONSULTANTS. OKAY THANK YOU COMMENTS FROM OHIO. WE REVIEW THE PROPOSAL BUT HAVE NO CONCERNS FINANCE. PHONES ALL RIGHT QUESTION FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY. ALL RIGHT CERTAINLY MORE MORE WORK NEEDS MORE PEOPLE ALL RIGHT -- ISSUE NUMBER THREE IS WHICH IS THE CONVERSION OF BLANKET POSITIONS TO PERMANENT. CERTAINLY IN FISCAL YEAR TWELVE THIRTEEN GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THIRTY ONE IN BUDGET LETTER TWELVE POINT NO -- THREE WAS ISSUED ON MARCH TWELFTH AND REQUIRED DEPARTMENTS ALL DEPARTMENTS NOT JUST IMMENSELY TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT EXPENDITURES AND POSITIONS -- DIFFERENTLY -- FOR ENDEAVOR TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT. THE DAMAGE SEE AS A RESULT ELIMINATED SIXTEEN PERMANENTLY AUTHORIZED POSITIONS AT AS A RESULT OF THIS DIRECTIVE THE MAJORITY OF THOSE COMING FROM THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. AND THESE HAD BEEN VACANT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME WHICH IS WHY THAT THEY WERE ELIMINATED -- THE DEPARTMENT RETAIN THE THE CASH RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE POSITIONS BUT LOST THE POSITION OF AUTHORITY -- IN ORDER TO MEET OUR OPERATIONAL NEEDS WE USED OUR BLANKET SO WE USE THE CASH AND WE AUTHORIZES POSITIONS OUT OF OUR BLANK ADMINISTRATIVE TO TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CITIES OF THINGS LIKE HUMAN RESOURCES BUSINESS SERVICES AND THE LIKE. THEY WERE REQUESTING TO CONVERT THOSE SIXTEEN BLANKET POSITIONS TO PERMANENT AUTHORIZE POSITIONS WE BELIEVE TO ENHANCE BUDGET TRANSPARENCY BY ACCURATELY REFLECTING OUR STAFFING NEEDS. CONVERTING THESE POSITIONS REQUIRES NO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IT'S SIMPLY A CONVERSION OKAY -- SOUNDS GOOD ALEJO COMMENTS. THIS IS JUST A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT IN OUR VIEW AFTER RECEIVING SMART FROM IS FROM THE DEPARTMENT I HAVE ANY CONCERNS THANK YOU FINANCE COMMENTS OKAY SILENCE SILENCE. RIGHT QUESTIONS WE COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT SINCE SINCE OUR IS MOVE ON THE ISSUE NUMBER FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES PLANNED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. EIGHTY FIVE NINETY FIVE THE ASSEMBLY FOR FIVE NINETY FIVE PROVIDES AUTHORITY TO THAT TO THAT IMAGE SEE TO DISAPPROVE A HEALTH PLAN MERGER ACQUISITION. UPON THE DAMAGE TO FINDING THAT THE MERGER EITHER VIOLATES THE KNOCK KNOCKS KEEN ACT SUBSTANTIALLY LESSENS COMPETITION IN THE HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN PRODUCTS OR CREATES A MONOPOLY IN THE STATE. PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF AB NINE FIVE NINETY FIVE THE HEALTH BUT DO ME SEIZE MERGER REVIEW DID NOT INCLUDE REVIEW FOR THE IMPACT ON COMPETITION AS THOSE CONSIDERATIONS WERE OUTSIDE OF OUR AUTHORITY. HEALTH PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO GIVE NOTICE TO AND PROVIDE ALL THE NECESSARY INFORMATION AND RECEIVE PRIOR APPROVAL FROM THE DAMAGE SEE WHEN THE INTENT TO MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH OR ENTER INTO ANY SORT OF AGREEMENT RESULTING IN ITS PURCHASE ACQUISITION OR CONTROLLED BY ANY ENTITY. THIS BILL ALLOWS THE DAMAGE HE TO CONDITIONALLY APPROVED THE TRANSACTION OR AGREEMENT CONTINGENT ON THE HEALTH PLANS AGREEMENT TO VOTE FOR PHIL VARIOUS CONDITIONS WE CALL THEM UNDERTAKINGS. TO BENEFIT ENROLLEES OR PROVIDE FOR A MORE STABLE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO WE WILL ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS IN DETERMINING THE MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT -- WE ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT ON SUBSCRIBERS ARE ENROLLEES. THE STABILITY OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND OTHER RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE ACT FOR ALL WHAT ARE DEEMED MAJOR TRANSACTIONS OR AGREEMENTS. THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS THE IMAGE SEATED DISAPPROVE THE TRANSACTION IF IF FOR ANY REASON IT FAILS TO SATISFY THE LAW. IF IT SUBSTANTIALLY LESSENS COMPETITION AND HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN PRODUCTS OR CREATES A MONOPOLY IN THE STATE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO HEALTH COVERAGE PRODUCTS IN A SPECIFIC LINE OF BUSINESS. WE WILL OBTAIN AN OPINION OF FROM AN EXPERT CONSULTANT TO ASSESS THE COMPETITIVE IMPACT TO THE TRANSACTION AND PERFORM THE INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS. WE WILL HOLD A PUBLIC MEETING ON ALL AND PROPOSALS PRIOR TO APPROVING CONDITIONALLY APPROVING OR DENYING THE TRANSACTION. AND AS A RESULT OF ALL THIS ACTIVITY WE REQUEST EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY IN THE AMOUNT OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AND THE SAME AMOUNT ANNUALLY THEREAFTER TO ADDRESS THE ADDITIONAL CONSULTING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU. HELLO COMMENTS. THE REQUESTED RESOURCE IS A PAIR CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW LEGISLATION WE HAVE NO CONCERNS THANK YOU FINANCE.

TO TO JUST LOWEST YEAH OKAY SO THE FROM OKAY THE ACTUAL AN OPEN UP WITH ACTUALLY PRESENTATION BY LARA LET'S SEE -- HIS ATTRACTIVE HEALTHCARE PROGRAM UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER WHO HAS A PRESENTATION SO [inaudible] ABNORMAL [inaudible] OKAY. SO WE HAVE AN AGENCY THANKS FOR THIS -- A REVIEW. FOR OKAY. OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA START OFF WITH THE A A PRESENTATION FROM A ASSOCIATE WHO'S NOT REPRESENT AGENCY FURS GONNA GIVE US A OVERVIEW OF A BRIEF PRESENTATION ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REMAINING UNINSURED IN CALIFORNIA SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN WELCOME. OUR RESEARCH AGAIN. THAT IS THAT BETTER. THE A AND A SOME OF WHAT I'LL PRESENT TODAY IS NEW BUT I WILL ALSO BE RECAPPING SOME OF OUR RESEARCH THAT I SHARED WITH YOU IT EARLIER HEARINGS IN FEBRUARY -- SO I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF SINCE SOME OF THIS IS IS A REVIEW -- BUT I AM GOING TO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHO -- AND SOME OF THE REASONS. THAT PEOPLE REMAIN UNANSWERED. SO IN NOVEMBER ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT UCLA WE PUBLISHED THE PROJECTIONS OF THE TEENS IN THE UNINSURED RATE IN CALIFORNIA OVER TIME. AS YOU ALL KNOW WE SEEN GREAT GAINS IN TERMS OF THAT INSURANCE RATE IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT -- BUT WE PROJECTS THAT THE INSURANCE RATE COULD START TO CREEP BACK UP. 213% AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE ACA INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY GOING AWAY -- WE PROJECTS THAT THE BIGGEST A FAX OF NOT HAVING A FEDERAL PENALTY WILL BE THE INDIVIDUAL MARKETS. IN TERMS OF THE SHARE OF ENROLLMENTS DROP WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE AND THAT MARKETS. THE WE PROJECTS THAT BY. 202314%. FEWER PEOPLE COULD BE ENROLLED IN THE CALIFORNIA INDIVIDUAL MARKET AND LEFT THE STATE TAKES FURTHER ACTION. AND THAT SOLELY DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF THE PENALTY WE CAN ALSO SEE LOWER MEDI CAL ENROLLMENTS -- EVEN THOUGH IT PEOPLE WITH MEDIC HOLLER GENERALLY EXEMPT FROM PAYING THE FEDERAL PENALTY OR WHERE EXEMPTS. THE MANY OF THEM DID NOT KNOW IT -- SERVED AS A MOTIVATION FOR PEOPLE TO FIND OUT WHAT COVERAGE THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AND THEN ROLL AND SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDIC HOW DON'T REALIZE IT. AND GO TO COVER CALIFORNIA TO SHOP FOR COVERAGE AND FIND OUT THAT THEY CAN ENROLL IN MEDICARE OUT WITH NO PREMIUMS. AS THE THE LACK OF A PENALTY. WOULD WOULD REDUCE THAT MOTIVATION TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE. FOR AND THEN AS WE COULD SEE SOME SMALL CHANGES IN EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE BUT THEY'RE NOT. AS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AS A SHARE OF OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN TOPICS CONFERENCE. SO COMBINING. THE FACTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY GOING AWAY FEDERALLY WITH OTHER TRENDS LAKE POPULATION GROWTH PREMIUM GROWTH. WE PROJECTS THAT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS COULD. BE UNINSURED IN TWENTY TWENTY GROWING TO FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION IN. TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THE LARGEST GROUP OF UNINSURED -- WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS -- THE NEXT BIGGEST GROUP WOULD BE THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT SUBSIDIES -- BUT NOT AND ROLES. THE PEOPLE THE PROJECT TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL BUT NOT AND ROLLED. AND THEN SAM WHO HAVE AN OFFER OF EMPLOYER COVERAGE BUT DON'T -- ENROLLED PRIMARILY DUE TO AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS SO I'M GONNA TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT -- A FEW OF THESE GROUPS. SO I AS WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE THE OF THE FULL COMMITTEE HEARING IN FEBRUARY. THE LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED OLD HAVE A PARTICULARLY HIGH AND INSURANCE RATE. 90% ALMOST -- COMPARED 211% AN INSURANCE RATE FOR CITIZENS AND DOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS OF THE SAME INCOME LEVEL. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE EXCLUDED FROM MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY UNDER FEDERAL POLICY. THEY'RE EXCLUDED FROM. ENROLLING IN COVERED CALIFORNIA EVEN WITHOUT SUBSIDIES THEY COULDN'T THEY COULD PURCHASE COVERAGE DIRECTLY FROM AN INSURER BUT AT THIS INCOME LEVEL -- THAT IS GENERALLY AND AFFORDABLE. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY MAKE UP ALMOST 10% OF THE WORKFORCE UNDOCUMENTED. WORKERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE OFFERED JOB THIS COVERAGE BECAUSE OF THE INDUSTRIES AND OCCUPATIONS AID TEND TO WORK ON TURNING TO THE THE FORD ABILITY CHALLENGES. A IT. THERE ARE EVEN THOUGH WE'VE MADE SOME WHAT ABOUT CARE ACT IN IMPROVING INDIVIDUAL MARKET AFFORDABILITY THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS FOR THOSE EVEN ROLLED AND THOSE WHO ARE UNINSURED. FOR THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A CA SUBSIDIES FOR THOSE HEARING TOO MUCH AND IT'S A PROBLEM -- THE PREMIUM SIDE BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE PAY OUT OF POCKET. AND THE STATUS SPECIFICALLY IS FROM IT A STUDY BY HARVARD RESPECT SURVEY BY HARVARD RESEARCHERS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. AND ROUGHLY FOUR OUT OF TEN THAT HAD HAVE SOME OR A LOT OF DIFFICULTY AFFORDING PREMIUMS AND THEIR SURVEY SHOWS THAT THIS. LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY IS RELATIVELY SIMILAR ACROSS INCOME LEVELS. OF THE ROUGHLY THREE OUT OF TEN HAD DIFFICULTY AFFORDING OUT OF POCKET COSTS WITH A SLIGHTLY LOWER PERCENTAGE IN THE HIGHER INCOME GROUPS. FACING THIS DIFFICULTIES. THERE IS NOT SIMILAR AT THE DATA AVAILABLE AT THIS LEVEL OF FOR THE UNINSURED WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE CALIFORNIA BUT WE DO KNOW FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY. THAT COST AS THE TOP REASON FOR THAT GROUP TO REPORT LACKING COVERAGE AND THAT'S TRUE REGARDLESS OF WHAT. INCOME LEVEL YOU'RE LOOKING AT SO TO GIVE TWO EXAMPLES OF THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES. AT FIRST IT TAKE A FULL TIME WORKER IN LA WHO'S EARNING MINIMUM WAGE OR ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BASED ON THE UPCOMING LA MINIMUM WAGE. AND THIS IS A SINGLE WORKER NO KIDS. HE WOULD PAY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR PREMIUMS FOR THE SECOND LOWEST SILVER PLAN WITH THE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE. A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH -- FOR A BRONZE PLAN WITH A SIXTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE OR HE COULD GO WITHOUT INSURANCE AND DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH HE'S PAYING FOR THESE. AMOUNTS THAT COULD BE AN AFFORDABLE. A THIS IS AN EXAMPLE HE TALKS ABOUT AT THE AFFORDABILITY HEARING IN FEBRUARY. A MARRIED COUPLE EARNING. EARNING ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS BOTH EACH FIFTY FIVE LIVING IN SAN MATTEO. BUT THIS COUPLE WOULD FACE SOME HARD CHOICES A IT. PAYING THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR A BRONZE PLAN WHICH WOULD BE 22% OF THEIR INCOME BEFORE THEY PAY ANY OUT OF POCKET COSTS UNDER THE SIXTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE. OR IF THEY WANTED TO REDUCE THEIR OUT OF POCKET RISK TO A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE IN A SILVER PLAN THEY WOULD PAID TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE SECOND LOWEST COST SILVER PLAN. THAT'SALMOST A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME ON PREMIUMS ALONE. THE OR THEY COULD GO WITHOUT INSURANCE AND SAID THESE LAKE THE THE MINIMUM WAGE WORKER EXAMPLE -- IN BOTH OF THESE EXAMPLES THEY WOULD FACE VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES. ON TUESDAY WE RELEASED A NEW BLOG POST ON THE GROUP OF CALIFORNIANS WHO'S UNINSURED BUT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL. AND THERE THE THESE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHY THIS GROUP STILL EXISTS -- WE'D AND I WANNA START UP A NOTING THAT WE DO HAVE A TAKE OPERATE OF MEDI CAL IN THE STATE OF MORE THAN 90%. WHICH IS A A GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A BIG IMPROVEMENT FROM PRIOR TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S -- BUT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDIC HOW -- AT A EVEN IF EVEN TAKING UP MEANS A LOT OF PEOPLE AND ENSURE. A AND SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THAT ARE SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE THAT THERE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CL OR THAT THEY WOULDN'T PAY PREMIUMS FOR MEDI CAL. OTHERS ARE UNINSURED FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME WHEN THEY'RE BETWEEN JOBS OR GOING TO OTHER LIFE TRANSITIONS AND THERE'S DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY THAT SHOWS. THAT A SUBSTANTIAL FRACTION OF THIS GROUP. DID HAVE SOME KIND OF INSURANCE FOR PART OF THE YEAR. AS SOME MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES AND ROLLING OR RENEWING THEIR COVERAGE AND OTHERS MAY WORRY ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES THAT AND ROLLING COULD HAVE FOR THEIR OWN IMMIGRATION STATUS ARE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. THERE IS A RECENT SURVEY BY CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION THAT INDICATED THAT 40% OF ALL AN INSURED. THE CALIFORNIA ADULTS THAT ALL INCOME LEVELS AND WE'RE VERY OR SOMEWHAT WORRIED ABOUT WHAT SIGNING UP FOR HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD NEED FOR THEIR FAMILY IN TERMS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT EFFECT THIS HAS HAD ALREADY ON ON MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT RATES BUT IT IT WILL BE EVEN MORE OF A CONCERN IF THE TRUMP PUBLIC CHARGE PROPOSAL IS FINALIZED -- LASTLY IN TERMS OF WHO IS UNINSURED AND ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE I'LL USING THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY DATA AND WE LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS. AND AMONG ADULTS IN THIS GROUP ABOUT TWO THIRDS ARE LATINO. THE MORE THAN 40% OR IMMIGRANTS. AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS LIVE IN THE HOUSEHOLD. WHERE AND A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH IS SPOKEN SOLELY OR IN ADDITION TO ENGLISH? AND AND THESE TRENDS ARE A RELATIVE MEDI CAL SO THESE TRENDS ARE. NOT SO MUCH A REFLECTION OF OF WHO'S BEEN. LEFT OUT BUT A REFLECTION OF WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT I THINK THE DEMOGRAPHICS REALLY -- POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE OUT REACH AND THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY I WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS I THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- ANY COMMENTS FROM LA -- ON THIS NOW FINANCE NO ALL RIGHT QUESTION CAN YOU MEMBERS. SO WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I THINK. THE I THINK IT'S GIVING US A GOOD PLATFORM FOR OUR OUR NEXT DISCUSSIONS WHICH IS ABOUT -- THE OTHER FOUR WD ISSUE WHICH YOU'VE POINTED OUT -- AND FORTUNATELY -- DO SOME FEDERAL ACTIONS -- ALSO WE'VE HAD LESS MONEY FOR AFFORDABILITY -- AND THEN OF COURSE THE ISSUE THEY'LL EXPANSION OF MEDIC HOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING YOUNG ADULTS I THINK THERE'S A BILL THAT JUST PASSED OUT HEALTH COMMITTEE. TO GET TO HAVE. BEEN EVEN MORE BUT IT BUT ISSUE I SHE CAME UP IN OUR HEALTH COMMITTEE WHICH YOU BROUGHT UP AS WELL AS YOUR PRESENTATION ABOUT THE THE IMPACT PUBLIC CHARGE AS WELL SO. I EVEN IF WE PROVIDE THE COVERAGE -- PEOPLE MAY NOT TAKE IT OUT BECAUSE OF OTHER FEARS AND AND SO. I NEED TO ALSO THINK ABOUT. OTHER AVENUES BY WHICH PEOPLE CAN GET CARE BUT CERTAINLY. FOR THOSE WHO -- ACTUALLY -- WHO WANT THE COVERAGE RIGHT -- WHO WHO HIT AT THAT -- WE NEED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AS WELL AND I THINK -- IT'S DIFFERENT ONE IT'S JUST NOT THERE I MEAN AND THEN PEOPLE YOU HAVE A CHOICE WHETHER TO A CONSIDERABLE CHARTER DOT SO. APPRECIATE THAT OKAY -- RIGHT SEEN OTHER QUESTIONS I THINK YOU KNOW IT ALWAYS OF EXCELLENT PRESENTATION FAIRLY THOROUGH SO I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND WE SHOULD STILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AGO DRILL INTO THIS TIME SO. ALRIGHT THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING TIME TO COME OVER PRESENT TO US IT'S BEEN BRAVE. REPORT INFORMATION THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NOW IS -- WE HAVE FLAT -- TWO PANELS -- SO THE FIRST PANELS ON EXPANDING AFFORDABILITY INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET VERY IMPORTANT PROPOSALS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MADE AND THE AND AND IS -- JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSALS -- AND ALSO AND LOOKING FORWARD BECAUSE WE HAVE IN OUR PANELS -- MEMBERS FROM THE PART OF FINANCE SCHOOL LAB RATE PERHAPS MORE DETAIL THAN WE'VE GOTTEN IN THE PAST ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THE SPECIFIC THE POLLS WILL BE. SO WAS THAT THE TWO BIG PROPOSALS ARE EXPANDING AFFORDABILITY AND WHERE THAT'S CA IN START WITH ISSUE TO AND THEN LATER THE NEXT ONE WILL BE ISSUE THREE WHICH IS THE FULL SCOPE MEDICAID EXPANSION FROM DOCUMENT YOUNG ADULTS SO FOR THIS PANEL -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE JACOB LAMB PRINCIPLE PROGRAM BUDGET ANALYST FOR THE PART OF FINANCE -- ALEXANDER -- KIP CLINIC THEY PRONOUNCE IT CORRECTLY -- FINANCE BUDGET ANALYST FOR THE FAR FINANCE -- CAPELLA FOR THAT POLICY OF GIVING HELD ACCESS SO I CALIFORNIA AND CHEN FLORI POLICY ADVOCATE FROM WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND WHY DID JUST RATTLE OFF THE NAMES WE WILL DO IS. SINCE I MAY KNOW ALL OF YOU BUT NEVER AS MUCH EACH INTRODUCE YOURSELVES OF PEOPLE ATTACH THE FACE TO THE NAME. SO WHEN WE JUST GO START THIS AND ALCHEMIC DEPARTMENT FINANCE. TAKEN LAND APARTMENT FINANCE. THE BELL HEALTHAXIS NOT BE SHARING MY TIME WITH CLEAR HAAS. GEN FLOOR WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. KATIE RAVEL COVER CALIFORNIA. AND JUST FOR THE RECORD IF WE ALWAYS I RECOGNIZE LA -- I WILL THE FROM THE ELIA OKAY WELCOME ALL RIGHT SO ONLY BE GO AHEAD BEGIN WITH A FINANCE -- WITH MISTER LAMB CLINIC WELCOME. THE I HAVE MY THREE THREE MINUTE RULE -- CELL AND THE LEVY WAY OF QUESTIONS YOU HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORATE EVEN MORE I'M SURE TO WILL BE SOME QUESTIONS SO. I'M SURE ALL MR SURE THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TODAY TO PRESENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON AFFORDABILITY. AT FIRST NO BY. BUT FIRST NOTE THAT WE POSTED THE TRAILER BILL FOR THIS PROPOSAL ON A PUBLIC WEBSITE THIS MORNING AND HAPPEN TO DISCUSS FURTHER DETAILS WITH YOUR STAFF. OF WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY SAYING THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO MAKE HEALTH INSURANCE MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO PURCHASE HEALTH KERR CARE COVERAGE THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA. THIS PROPOSAL CONTAINS TWO MAIN COMPONENTS FIRST AS THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE A NEW STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO COMPONENTS WILL WORK IN TANDEM TO INCREASE ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY TO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. AND GROW UPON THE SUCCESS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. REGARDING THE MANDATE WE'VE MODEL OR PROPOSAL CLOSELY OFFER THE FEDERAL LAW. THE MANDATE WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA WITH COVER CALIFORNIA. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. THE PENALTY WOULD BE SCALABLE BASED ON INCOME AND FAMILY SIZE. AND MAINTAIN THE FEDERAL EXEMPTIONS AS CODIFIED TODAY OUR PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO JUST AUTOMATICALLY IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WERE TO REINSTATE THE FEDERAL PENALTY -- BASED ON DISCUSSIONS AND FEEDBACK WE'VE HAD WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMITTEE STAFF WE ARE. PROPOSING TO DEPOSIT ANY PENALTY REVENUE DIRECTLY INTO THE GENERAL FUND. NEXT IS THE STATE'S SUBSIDY PROGRAM. OUR PROPOSAL WOULD OFFER STATES LEVEL SUBSIDIES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOMES BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND 60% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL FOR A FAMILY FOR THIS WOULD BE. 620-002-0050. THOUSAND THIS WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO PROVIDE STATE LEVEL SUBSIDIES THE AND TO MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMERS. SPECIFICALLY THE PROPOSED PROGRAM WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION BEEN MISTER BY COVERED CALIFORNIA. PROVIDE ADVANCED PREMIUM ASSISTANCE AND SUNSET DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO BASED ON APPROPRIATE FUNDS COVER CALIFORNIA WOULD DESIGN A SUBSIDY PROGRAM ON ANNUAL BASIS. FOR THE ANNUAL OPEN ENROLLMENT. PERIOD THE FINAL SONG OF PROGRAM DESIGN WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. CONSUMERS WILL RECEIVE THEIR ESTIMATES SUBSIDY AMOUNT WHEN THEY ENROLL FOR COVERAGE FOR THAT COVERAGE HERE. AND AGAIN THIS PROCESS IS SUBSTANTIVELY SIMILAR TO WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SO I'LL NOTE A FEW KEY DESIGN CHOICES WE MADE WHEN DESIGNING THIS PROPOSAL. FIRST I'LL NOTE AGAIN THAT THIS VERY CLOSELY MON MIR'S THE FEDERAL FRAMEWORK THAT'S IN PLACE THIS WAS -- Q. DESIGN CHOICE AND THAT IT WILL ALLOW FOLKS TO BE MORE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN PLACE AND BUILD UPON. WHAT IS ALREADY BEEN? PIONEERED BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. NEXT IS THE INTEL ON THE ADMINISTRATION THAT ANY SUBSIDY AMOUNT APPROPRIATE ON ANNUAL BASIS CLOSELY NEARS THE REVENUE THAT WE GENERATE FROM THE PENALTY. IN PLACE. WE HAD PREVIOUSLY SHARED ESTIMATES OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS BASED OFF. INFORMATION FROM THE IRS FOR TAX YOUR TWENTY SIXTEEN FROM THE FEDERAL PENALTY. WE'LL UPDATE THIS REVENUE ESTIMATE AT ME REVISION ENSURE DETAILS AT THAT TIME HOWEVER WE WILL NOTE THAT. THE CALIFORNIA FILING THRESHOLD IS HIGHER THAN THE FEDERAL FILING THRESHOLD SO FEWER PEOPLE WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE PENALTY -- NEXT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THIS WILL NOT BE A NEW ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM HOWEVER WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AROUND US MS MAY VERY SIGNIFICANTLY ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS. IT'S NOT OUR INTENT THAT FOLKS TO RECEIVE A GET A DIFFERENT AMOUNT. ONCE OF REVENUE AMOUNT COMES IN BUT ON A SUBSEQUENT YEAR THE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THAT PROGRAM MAY DECREASE OR INCREASE WHICH WILL CHANGE THEMSELVES IN OUT FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. I'LL ALSO NOTE THAT WE DO NOT INTEND THE SUBSIDIES PROVIDE TO FOLKS BELOW 210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO BE HIGHER THAN INDIVIDUALS ABOUT LEVEL. AND AFFECT OUR PROPOSAL WOULD. SLOW THE DECLINE THAT IS CURRENTLY SEEN ON THE FEDERAL MARKETPLACE FOR THE SUBSIDIES RECEIVED BY THESE INDIVIDUALS. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO NOTE OUR PROPOSAL TO SUNSET THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS KNOWN BY THE GOVERNOR WHILE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD MAINTAIN MARKET STABILITY. THE GOVERNOR HAS CALLED ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO OF ALL THE FORMAL CHARACTER ENSURE CONTINUES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL AMERICANS. WITHOUT FEDERAL SUPPORT CALIFORNIAN OTHER STATES ARE SEVERELY LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO FULLY ADDRESS THE REMAINING AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. SOMETHING THIS PROGRAM AFTER THREE COVERAGE YEARS WILL PROVIDE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TIME TO REVISIT AND ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES FOR ALL AMERICANS. AND THE LAST THING ON NOTE IS OUR PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW DATA SHARING BETWEEN THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND COVER CALIFORNIA'S THAT COVER CALIFORNIA CAN TARGET. ENROLLMENT EFFORTS FOR FOLKS WHO ARE UNINSURED AND PAYING THE PENALTY. AND WITH THAT WERE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL BUT THANK YOU. THEM NO OKAY SEE SERVE BREAK NICK DID IT AT ALL OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU TO REBEL. WELL THANK YOU THE MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PROVIDED A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR A STABLE INDIVIDUAL MARKET THROUGH A COMBINATION OF MARKET REFORMS AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. SUBSIDIES TO MAKE PREMIUMS AN OUT OF POCKET COSTS MORE AFFORDABLE AND PROGRAMS TO BALANCE RISK BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA'S MADE REMARKS CORRECT IN REDUCING THE RATE OF THE UNINSURED BUT DESPITE THESE GAINS AFFORDABILITY OF COVERAGE REMAINS A VERY REAL CHALLENGE FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND ACROSS THE NATION AND RECENT FEDERAL POLICY ACTIONS THREATEN TO TAKE US BACKWARDS MISS LUCY A PROVIDED AN EXCELLENT OVERVIEW OF THESE CHALLENGES AND HER PRESENTATION. PURSUANT TO OUR LEGISLATIVE MANDATE COVER CALIFORNIA DEVELOPED AND SUBMITTED A SET OF POLICY OPTIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR. AND THE COUNCIL ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES AND IMPROVE PORTABILITY FOR LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMERS. IS OPTIONS WERE DEVELOPED THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH THE STAKEHOLDER WORK GROUP COMPRISED OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES HEALTH PLANS PROVIDERS ASSOCIATIONS AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF. AND WE WERE ASSISTED IN MODELING BY ECONOMIST DR WESLEY ANY UCLA AND DOCTOR NECKLACE TELL MEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS. OUR WORK GROUP CONSIDERED A VARIETY OF OPTIONS BUILDING ON THE TOOLS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT NAMELY PREMIUM CARSHARING SUPPORT AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND REINSURANCE. WE PROVIDE OPTIONS UNDER TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES UNDER THE FIRST APPROACH WE MODELED ENHANCE PREMIUM AND COST SHARING SUPPORT. THAT WOULD PROVIDE -- ENHANCE SUPPORT TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TODAY AND WOOD LAMINATE THE TAX CREDIT CLIFF WITHIN LAYERED ON AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND PENALTY AND THEN FINALLY WE LAYERED ON REINSURANCE. THESE OPTIONS WERE DESIGNED TO BUILD ON EACH OTHER. AND TO INCREASE AFFORDABILITY FOR EVERYONE PURCHASING COVERAGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET -- I WOULD NOTE THAT THE FIRST TWO OPTIONS CAN BE ADOPTED BY THE STATE IN THE THIRD WOULD REQUIRE WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH A WAIVER. AND APPROACH TO WE DEVELOPED A SERIES OF DISCRETE OPTIONS TARGETED TO SPECIFIC INCOME GROUPS AND WE DID THIS OUT OF RECOMMEND RECOGNITION THE POLICY MAKERS WOULD NEED TO MAKE TRADE OFFS DUE TO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS. OF THE GROUPS WE FOCUSED ON WHERE INDIVIDUALS UNDER 4100% INDIVIDUALS UNDER 6100% IN RECOGNITION OF OUR CHARGE UNDER THE STATUTE. INDIVIDUALS ABOVE 4100% AND THEN WE ELATION. MOST OF THESE OPTIONS ARE PROJECTED TO COST LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION EACH YEAR OR IN THE FIRST YEAR. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIFTY THOUSAND AND A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND LIKE ALL OF THE OPTIONS THEY WOULD ALSO REDUCE COSTS FOR INDIVIDUALS PURCHASING TODAY. THE STAFF ANALYSIS DOESN'T EXCELLENT JOB SUMMARIZING THE IMPACTS OF THE OPTIONS IN DETAIL. TO RATHER THAN RECEIVING THEM AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL CLOSE WITH SOME HIGH LEVEL TAKE AWAYS FROM OUR WORK. REINSTATEMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTYDOES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT WHEN PAIRED WITH POLICIES THAT MAKE PLANS MORE AFFORDABLE. IN ADDITION TO GENERATING OFFSETTING REVENUE AND INDUCES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NEW ENROLLMENT WHICH IN TURN CAN HAVE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON PREMIUMS. IT ALSO INDUCES MORE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR INDIVIDUALS UNDER LEVEL. WHO NEWLY SIGN UP AND GAIN NOT JUST NEW STATE TAX CREDITS BUT FEDERAL TAX CREDITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY? AS WE KNOW PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING SUBSIDIES MAKE COVERAGE MORE AFFORDABLE AND CREATE SIGNIFICANT GAINS AND ENROLLMENT. POLICIES THAT ADDRESS THE TAX CREDIT CLIFF WOULD HELP PEOPLE ABOVE 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WITH BUYING INSURANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. A THE IMPACT OF THIS POLICIES PARTICULARLY STRIKING FOR INDIVIDUALS AND HIGH COST REGION'S WHO ARE APPROACHING MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY AND WE HEARD THAT MISS LUCY IS PRESENTATION. FOR THOSE UNDER LEVEL BIGGER SUBSIDIES DO MATTER AND GENERATE SIGNIFICANT NEW ENROLLMENT. AS EXPECTED ARE MODELING SHOWS THAT BY PROVIDING PREMIUM SUBSIDIES YOU WOULD HAVE MORE OF AN INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT AND COST SHARING SUBSIDIES. BUT COST SHARING SUBSIDIES TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MY MORE GENEROUS COVERAGE. WITH THAT I WILL CLOSE WE HOPE THESE OPTIONS ARE HELPFUL TO INFORM THE DISCUSSIONS AND WE STAND READY TO WORK WITH YOU AND THE ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL. HI MY NAME IS CLAIRE HAAS -- I LIVE IN OAKLAND. SO BEFORE THE ACA WENT INTO FACTS I A NEEDED TO HAVE A JOB THAT GAVE ME HEALTH CARE I HAVE MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE WHICH IS A WOMAN. THAT DOESN'T DO ANY THE HOMES TO ME -- BUT IT IS A PRE EXISTING CONDITION UPON WHICH I WAS DENIED COVERAGE AS A YOUNG ADULT SO ONCE THE ACA WAS PASSED THAT ALLOWED ME TO HAVE SOME OPTIONS ON THE LAST YEAR I LEFT MY JOB -- AND STARTED MY OWN BUSINESS WHICH IS SOMETHING I'VE JUMPED OF DOING FOR A LONG TIME -- AND I KNEW THAT COVER CALIFORNIA WOULD GIVE ME THE HEALTH CARE THAT I NEEDED. MY HUSBAND IS AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR HE RECENTLY GOT HIS PHD FROM UC BERKELEY AND HE WAS ABLE TO FIND A TEACHING JOB BUT AS AN ADJUNCT AND IF YOU KNOW ABOUT ADDS ON JOBS. THEY DON'T PAY VERY WELL AND THEY DEFINITELY DO SO THAT MEANS WERE BOTH ON THE EXCHANGE -- IF WE WANT MARY. BOTH OF US INDIVIDUALLY WOULD COVER QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT BECAUSE WE'RE MARRIED OUR JOINT GROSS INCOME IS JUST OVER ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR LIMIT. AND SO WE DON'T QUALIFY FOR ANY SUBSIDY ONE OF THOSE FAMILIES THAT'S FACING THOSE DIFFICULT THE CHOICE. AND THE RATES KEEP GOING UP -- I ACTUALLY ENROLLED IN COBRA BECAUSE IT WAS A BETTER VALUE COSTS THEN THE EXCHANGE FOR ME -- AND MY PARTNER IS ON THE LOWEST COVERED CALIFORNIA PLAN SO WE HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO USE IT BECAUSE THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE REALLY HIGH -- TOGETHER WE PAY ABOUT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IN INSURANCE PREMIUMS WHICH COMES OUT TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. ON IT'S ABOUT 15% OF OUR INCOME AND THAT'S JUST FOR PREMIUMS IT'S NOT ACTUALLY FOR THE HEALTH CARE ITSELF IT'S JUST PAYING. THE INSURANCE COMPANY SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE A PROFIT -- WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT JOINING THAT ESTIMATED 13% IN THE PRESENTATION IN A COUPLE YEARS OF NOT BEING INSURED WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT TO STOPPING PAYING -- ANY PENALTY THAT WOULD EXIST WOULD BE FAR LESS THAN THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WE'RE PAYING NOW -- BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT GETTING DIVORCED SO THAT WE CAN GET SUBSIDIES TO PAY FOR A HEALTHCARE -- WE TALK ABOUT THAT LIKE EVERY MONTH WHEN WE PAY THE BILL. HEALTHCARE IS A GREAT AND IT SHOULD BE FREE AND IT SHOULD BE QUALITY AND IF IT CAN'T BE FREE AT LEAST NEEDS TO BE AFFORDABLE -- AND SO I'M HERE TAKING THE DAY OFF -- BEING HER TO TALK TO ENSURE THE STORY IMPLEMENT THESE MEASURES TO MAKE HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND WHEN YOU DO IT DON'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT OPEN ENROLLMENT. PERIOD I'M PAYING NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS EVERY MONTH I WOULD URGE YOU TO DO IT NOW [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] AS FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS MORNING OF CHEN FLORI WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. WE DO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S ATTENTION TO MAKING HEALTH COVERAGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE WHO PURCHASED IT DIRECTLY AND COVER CALIFORNIA'S WORK ON MODELING THE DIFFERENT AFFORDABILITY MODELS. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S CURRENT PROPOSAL THAT IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE BELOW 210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE BELOW ONE HUNDRED AND 38% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY ANYTHING FOR THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE. MANY OF THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO EARN LESS THAN FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH ONCE FOOD RENT AND UTILITIES ARE PAID FOR THERE'S SIMPLY NOTHING LEFT TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE. THE MAJORITY OF THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE -- BUT THEY HAVE A TEMPORARY IMMIGRATION STATUS AND A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OUR SENIORS WHO FIND THEMSELVES NEITHER ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE NOR MEDI CAL DUE TO VARIOUS PROGRAM RULES. HOWEVER BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ALREADY A ELIGIBLE FOR LARGE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES THEY'RE ALSO THE CHEAPEST TO HELP. FOR THOSE EARNING JUST ABOVE 138% MOVING FROM MEDICAID TO COVER CALIFORNIA CAN FEEL LIKE FALLING OFF A CLIFF. THEY GO FROM BEING ELIGIBLE FOR FREE CARE TO HAVING MONTHLY PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS WHEN THEY ACCESS CARE YET THEY'RE STILL STRUGGLING TO PAY RENT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S ANOTHER CLIFF WHEN THE OUT OF POCKET ASSISTANCE RUNS OUT BESIDES THE ONE THAT CLEAR JUST MENTIONED -- WHICH IS NOT IT TOO IT 50% WHEN IT OFFICIALLY RUNS OUT BUT AT OUT GIVEN THE ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE -- IN OTHER WORDS THE WAY THE ASSISTANCE IS METED OUT ITS THERE'S YOU EITHER GET THAT PLAN WAS 70% ACTUARIAL VALUE OR 73% ACTUAR VALUE AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR SUDDENLY THE INDIVIDUAL OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM MORE THAN DOUBLES FROM TWENTY SIX HUNDRED A YEAR TO SIXTY THREE HUNDRED A YEAR. AND THE INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR VISITS RANGE FROM THIRTY FIVE TO SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND THAT'S JUST FIVE DOLLARS THIS. LESSON FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ANY OUT OF I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE SIDE THAT MISS LUCY AT SHARED PREVIOUSLY ON THE DIFFICULTY INDIVIDUAL MARKET AND RELEASE REPORT IN AFFORDING PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS. PEOPLE EARNING LESS THAN 250% REPORT THE SAME DIFFICULTY IN AFFORDING PREMIUMS ARE USING THEIR CARE DESPITE ALL THE EXTRA SYSTEMS THAT'S AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY HAVE LESS MONEY. PARTICULARLY IF WE ARE PLANNING ON REINSTATING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WE CANNOT IGNORE THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAT THESE GROUPS SPACE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALCATEL BUT JUST YET. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TODAY -- WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THE WORKER COVER CALIFORNIA I THINK WHEN YOU. REVIEW ISSUE HAVING NOW AND SEVERAL HEARINGS THE WORK BUT COVER CALIFORNIA TO REALLY MOVED THE NEEDLE ON THE UNINSURED TO CUT THE UNINSURED IN HALF. WE NEED TO LOOK OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS OF THE PROPOSAL MUCH BIGGER THAN THE ONE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PRESENTED TO US TODAY. WE NEED TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE NOBODY'S PAYING THIRTY OR 40% OF THEIR INCOME FOR COVERAGES MISS LUCY A PRESENTED OR 15% OF THEIR INCOME IS. MISS HAAS PRESENTED WE WANT TO ELIMINATE THE CLIFFS YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE UP AND DOWN THE INCOME SCALE. AND STARTING WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS UNDER A 138% OF POVERTY THE MISS FLORI JUST TALKED ABOUT. WE DO APPRECIATE THE TBL WITH THAT WE RECEIVED AT NINE TWENTY FIVE THIS MORNING AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING IT -- WHEN WE HAVE A TOUCH MORE TIME? WE REALIZE THAT WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE ALL OF WHAT WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE IN TERMS OF APPROVING AFFORDABILITY IN CUTTING THE NUMBER OF REMAINING AN UNINSURED IN HALF THIS YEAR. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO IMPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- THE LIMITATIONS OF THE PENALTY REVENUE ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS I KNOW MISTER CHAIR AS YOU KNOW AND HAVE DISCUSSED. IDEALLY THE PENALTY REVENUE LIKE THE TOBACCO TAX WOULD BE -- ZERO BECAUSE EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE AFFORDABLE CARE. AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO IMPROVE ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND ALSO OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE ARE AT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AND COVERAGE IN THE AFFORDABLE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET IS NOT CAUSING PEOPLE TO GO WITHOUT FOOD OR RENT MONEY THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- CENTER STONE. THE FUTURE -- TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT. AND I'M -- BUT CAN I JUST PAUSE FOR ONE MOMENT -- TO ANY COMES FROM ALEJO. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST BRIEFLY -- OUR OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT WITH PRELIMINARY COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS RELATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIES EARLIER IN FEBRUARY AND WE PRESENTED OUR COMMENTS FROM THAT REPORT AT THE PREVIOUS -- JOINT HEARING THAT THIS COMMITTEE PARTICIPATED IN -- I'M HAPPY TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN IN YOUR DIRECTION BUT WANTED TO FOCUS ON A FEW COMMENTS -- WE RECEIVED AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THIS MORNING A COPY OF THE TRAILER BILL WHICH HAS SOME MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THAT -- BUT WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT AND THINK WE'LL BE DECISION POINTS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PAY ATTENTION -- TO ONE IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE INVOLVEMENT IN -- CRAFTING THE PARAMETERS OF THE THE FINAL -- DECISION IN SOME WAYS WOULD BE WITH -- COVER CALIFORNIA IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE -- DECISION BUT THEY'RE STILL OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THERE -- FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTRIBUTE ITS THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF THE WHERE TO PUT THE FUNDING AND ANOTHER PARAMETER SO WE'LL BE LOOKING TO TO SEE THE EXTENT TO WHICH LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATE -- INVOLVEMENT ON THAT -- ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ASSISTANCE MIGHT VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND HOW MUCH UNCERTAINTY THAT COULD INTRODUCE FOR CONSUMERS THAT RECEIVE IT -- LASTLY -- IT APPEARS THAT THE CREDITS AT THE SUB THESE WOULD BE STRUCTURED SIMILAR TO THE A. P. T. C. WHERE THEIR RECONCILED THROUGH THE INCOME TAX SYSTEM AT THE END OF THE YEAR. AND WE NOTED OUR EARLIER -- OTHER STATES LIKE -- MASSACHUSETTS AND OTHER STATES THAT HAVE A SUB THESE LIKE THIS DON'T ACTUALLY TRIP THEIR CREDITS THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY CREDITS THIS JUST ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED. TO INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THEIR TRADE UP THROUGH THE YEAR -- WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT THERE IS NO INCOME TAX INVOLVED AND SO. THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR MORE COMMENTARY ON THE BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF THAT SORT OF AN APPROACH -- AS AS THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING NAY I THINK THEY WOULD LOOK AT AS THEY DEVELOP THEIR PROPOSAL. OKAY THANK YOU. I ASSUME FINANCE PRESENTED THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. AT THIS POINT OKAY CENTER SO I APOLOGIZE -- NOT A PROBLEM -- WITH REGARD TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CHU REVEALED -- TODAY -- IT'S GOING TO GENERATE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHAT THE ESTIMATE HAS BEEN BASED ON FEDERAL -- EXAMINATIONS -- THE THE THE BIGGEST CONCERN I HAVE IS HOW WHY IS IT BEING DEPOSITED INTO THE GENERAL FUND I THOUGHT THE PURPOSE OF THE THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS TO NUMBER ONE GET PEOPLE TO BUY INSURANCE TO EQUALIZE THE POOL. AND TO PROVIDE FOR SUBSIDIES AND AND I REALLY APPRECIATE -- THE YOUNG LADY FOR COMING AND SPEAKING AND EXPLAINING YOUR PLIGHT. HI I HOPE YOU DON'T GET DIVORCED BECAUSE OF OF THE STATE'S -- COVER CALIFORNIA PROGRAM YOUR MESSAGE HAS BEEN HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR -- MY CONCERN IS THAT -- YOU KNOW THE GENERAL FUND YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY PUTTING IN THE FREE FOR ALL ACCOUNT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF ASKS IN A LOT OF NEEDS OF THE STATE AND EVERYBODY'S GONNA HAVE THEIR HAND IN THAT. IN A GENERAL FUND -- ESPECIALLY AFTER THE MAY REVISE AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE CONSUMMATION OF A BUDGET AND I THINK IT WOULD MAKE THE GOVERNOR'S ARGUMENT FOR IMPLEMENTING AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE -- MAYBE MORE PALATABLE TO PEOPLE MIGHT FIND IT UNPALATABLE -- WHEN HE DISCOVERS SHE'S GOING INTO THE GENERAL FUND WHICH MEANS BASICALLY CAN BE USED FOR ANYTHING? SO THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION THE SECOND QUESTION IS -- DEPENDING ON THE REVENUE STREAM THAT COMES FROM ALL OF THIS IS A ARE ARE WE SEEING AND MAYBE -- OTHERS CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION IS A SUBSIDY IS AT THE SAME EVERY YEAR OR IS IT VARYING EVERY YEAR SO WHEN YOU'RE GETTING A SUBSIDY YOU DON'T KNOW FROM YEAR TO YEAR WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOING TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE OR LESS AFFORDABLE FROM YEAR TO YEAR LIKELY -- Là BUT MORE ABOUT THAT. BALL ADDRESSED THE GENERAL FUND QUESTION I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE PENALTY AND SO THE PROGRAM WOULD BOTH BEGIN JANUARY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY WE'RE RECOMMENDING DEPOSITED DEPOSITING IT INTO THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IT WILL BE ADMINISTRATIVELY SIMPLER. TO HAVE THE PENALTY REVENUE FALL INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND PAID OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE WE WILL NOT HAVE THE ACTUAL REVENUE AMOUNTS UNTIL APRIL TWENTY FIRST OF APRIL OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TAX YEAR. AND SO I THINK IN ORDER BEGIN THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM IT MADE MORE SENSE. TO BEGIN IMMEDIATELY PAYING IT ALL THE GENERAL FUND BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO CONSIDER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. BY RAP PRETTY SURE THAT I KNOW AND I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER -- WORKING OUT WITH -- COVER CALIFORNIA AND DEPOSIT INTO AN ACCOUNT THAT. PROVIDES THE ABSOLUTE NEXUS FOR THE SUBSIDY AND THE HELP F PEOPLE THAT HAVING TROUBLE TO AFFORD INSURANCE. PREMIUMS AND AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK IT WOULD IT WOULD CERTAINLY GIVE ME A MARK OF A COMFORT LEVEL -- AND THEN IT CAN IT CAN NOW THIS MEANS. YOU DISCUSS THE THE THE VARIABLE. SUBSIDIES EVERY YEAR AND WHEN WHAT ONE OF MY CONCERNS. I'M SORRY I'M NOT BEEN CUT A DEAL FOR THE PAST MONTH SORRY YOU KNOW THE PHARMACIST COULD BETTER GET HIMSELF WELL BUT THIS VIRUS HAS BEEN ABOUT ONE OUR I'M CONCERNED AT THE OUR OUR STATE -- PROJECTIONS OF REVENUE ARE ARE. COMING IN LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED. AND THAT I'M CONCERNED THAT -- IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY OF YOU KNOW LOOKING AT REDUCING SUBSIDIES AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THE NEXUS WORKS WITH OUR INCOME STREAMS. MAYBE CAN ELABORATE ON THAT BUT THAT. WOULD IT WOULD SPEND THAT THE DELTA YEAR TO YEAR THAT PEOPLE CAN EXPECT TO SEE -- WHETHER THE PREMIUM SUBSIDIES ARE GOING UP BREWING DOWN AND AND I I CERTAINLY WANT TO MINIMIZE THE ANXIETY THAT MANY OF OUR OUR RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN. KNOWING FROM WE HEAR TO YOUR THAT THEY CAN LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE. THE CURRENT OF FEDERAL SCHEME FOR HOW TE SUBSIDIES ARE DISTRIBUTED IS BASED ON A MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION. THE MAXIMUM REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION THAT AS A PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME SO IT IS A SLIDING SCALE AND SO IF YOU'RE. UP 24100% SO IF YOUR INCOME DOES NOT CHANGE YOU WOULD BE PAYING A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME IN PREMIUMS IF YOU CHOSE THE SECOND LOWEST COST SILVER PLAN. NOW DEPENDING ON WHAT OTHER PLANS ARE AVAILABLE YOU MAY SEE FLUCTUATIONS IN WHAT YOU ARE PAYING -- BUT IT IS A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME NOW WE SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS IF THE STATE IS PLANNING ON YOU KNOW HAVING DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BASED ON WHAT'S AVAILABLE -- BUT IT IS A SLIDING SCALE TIED TO A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME. IT IS DIFFERENT PLEASE THANK YOU A BEST CAL HEALTH TEXAS. IT. WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE IF THE PENALTY AMOUNT OR PERCENTAGE IS THE SAME YEAR TO YEAR BUT THE HELP THAT PEOPLE GET BOUNCES AROUND. THAT I THINK WOULD NOT ACTIVE THAT WE SINKS TO THIS COMMITTEE AND THE ADMINISTRATION CHAIR OF TRYING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL HELP TO PEOPLE -- IN FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET FOR YEARS BECAUSE THEY ARE. ARE SELF EMPLOYED AND RUNNING THEIR OWN BUSINESS. THEY WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO PLAN AND BUDGET THERE ARE MANY OTHER PEOPLE FOR WHOM THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET IS SOMETHING THAT THEY USE IN BETWEEN JOBS SERVE DIVORCE. CHILD TURNED TWENTY SIX AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE SHORT BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO PLAN. AND SO TO HAVE THE MONEY BOUNCE AROUND. WHICH SEEMS TROUBLING AND IT WILL WILL LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AND WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH YOUR COMMITTEE ON THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANKS APPRECIATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- WELL I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS -- SO AND AGAIN I WANT FOR SO I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR -- FOR TRYING JUST -- THIS ISSUE AND SUPPORTING AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND ALSO THE THE IF -- SUBSIDIES FOR EXPANDING WANT -- TO BUT THAT OUT FRONT TO REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR -- PUTTING MAKING THIS A A A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF HIS EFFORTS TO TOWARD -- HEALTH FOR ALL -- NOW THAT WE HAVE SOME DETAILS THOUGH I DO WANT DAHLE AND AND AND EXTRA AND AND THAT'S YOU SOME QUESTIONS AND SEE WITH AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN -- AS WE TRY -- TO IMPROVE ON THE PROPOSALS -- THAT YOU'RE PUTTING FORD -- SO FIRST OF ALL LET ME START WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PORTION BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE MAINLY TALKING ABOUT SUBSIDIES I THINK THERE'S THOSE TWO SIR GO TOGETHER AND IN A FOR SOMEONE I THINK THE GOVERNOR -- FOR FOR SUPPORTING INDIVIDUAL MANDATE SOMETIMES IS THAT IT'S PUT THE POLITICALLY LEAST POPULAR -- BUT FRANKLY THIS WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY NECESSARY TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK RIGHT -- THE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN -- THE MORE EFFICIENT THE SYSTEM IS -- THE THE BETTER AS IN FACT -- THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- OURS CONGRESS AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SIDE TO ZERO OUT THE PENALTY ITSELF. HEALTHY SO THERE'S STILL MANDATE BUT ZEROED OUT THE PENALTY ESSENTIALLY IS CAUSED A COVERED CALIFORNIA UNDERSTAND TO HAVE TO RAISE PREMIUMS WHILE THESE 5% OF THAT PREMIUM RAISES RELATE IS RELATED TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO DESTABILIZE MARK INCLUDING BEHOLD INDIVIDUAL PENALTY. SO I MEAN IT'S COSTING PEOPLE WHEN THAT HAPPENED SO I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT REVERSING THAT. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION'S DESIRE TO PERHAPS THAT DIRECTLY PARALLEL WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I MEAN THERE'S SOME SIMPLICITY THERE -- BUT I I DO JUST WANT MAKE NOTE THAT THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION TO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE THAT I THINK IS A LITTLE TROUBLING TO ME -- I UNDERSTAND POLITICALLY WHY IT'S IN THE FEDERAL ONE BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE WOULD DO IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHICH IS ALSO SAYING THAT IF YOU'RE IN A HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY -- THOSE PRODUCTS IT'S ONE THING IF IT'S REALLY WITHIN THE CHURCH I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME SHOWERS BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY INTERESTING UP THIS FOLLOWS. THE PRESENTATION BY THE PART MANAGE HEALTHCARE WHICH IS THE POINTED OUT NAY EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING SHARED PLANS THERE WHEN YOU NEED IT I THINK THAT'S ONE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE ACA. YEAH WE PUT A LOT OF REGULATIONS OF PLANS TO BE SURE THAT IT'S THERE WHEN YOU NEED IT AND WE SEE THE EXCEPTION IS YOU CAN BE ESSENTIALLY IN A FORM OF WHILE ON A CALL COVERAGE OR NOT. IT'S NOT REALLY COVERAGE BUT THE PROBLEM IS IS RESERVE REQUIREMENTS THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE NETWORKS IT CETERA AND AND I UNDERSTAND POLITICALLY WIFE AND FEDERAL LEVEL THAT'S AN EXCEPTION I'M NOT SURE WHY WE WOULD HAVE THAT EXCEPTION AND IT IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE IT'S A LOOPHOLE. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE SEE PEOPLE GOING ON MARKETING THEM SO BEYOND JUST ANY PARTICULAR CONGREGATION SO -- SO CAN YOU PERHAPS -- SPEAK TO THE THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. SURE AND AGAIN I THINK. IN DROUGHT IN THIS TRAILER BILL WE TRIED TO HE WAS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO THE FEDERAL STATUTE THAT EXIST TODAY I THINK ADMINISTRATIVELY IT'S SIMPLER FOR US. TO IMPLEMENT A PROPOSAL THAT BEGINS CHAIR ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOLLOWING THE FRAMEWORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED -- WE DEFINITELY HEAR CONCERNS ARE HAPPY TO TAKE HIM BACK AGAINST THEIR OWN BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING ARE INTENT INTO DRAFTING THIS PROPOSAL WAS. TO KIND OF MATCH AS CLOSELY WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND NOT KIND OF RELITIGATE SO THOSE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT INTO THAT LAW BUT AGAIN HAPPY. TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS OKAY SO I THINK AT A MINIMUM. LOS WAS A I THINK IT'S BY BETTER OFF OF WE DON'T BUY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ANDERSON INDUSTRY COMPLEX THE AT THE STATE MINIMUM WE NEED TO MONITOR THIS AND IF PEOPLE GOING AROUND MARKETING. THESE THINGS AND BASICALLY TURNING IS SO -- AND DID MISTER COMPLEX TO MAKE HIM WITH IT. THE OTHER -- I GUESS EXCEPTION WHICH IS LESS TROUBLESOME -- IS -- AND IT AND CERTAINLY OPEN TO IS -- I THINK IF YOU BELONG TO CERTAIN -- RELIGIOUS GROUPS SO I THINK CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST BUT I THINK FOR EXAMPLE CITY MASSACHUSETTS DAM PERSIAN SAYING THAT FINE BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY END UP USING. IT OUT WHICH BASICALLY WOULD INDICATE. WELL IF YOU ACTUALLY ARE PERMITS ARE TO SAYS YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN HEALTH CARE BUT THEN YOU ACTUALLY END UP USING HEALTHCARE WELL THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE REQUIRED COVERAGE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT EVERYONE IS THE UNINSURED AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL GET MORE PEOPLE COVERAGE. WE STILL PAY FOR ITS JUST THE GETS SUBSIDIZED ANOTHER WAY SO -- SO PERHAPS AND SOME FINE WITH THAT FEDERAL PART BE IN THERE BUT MAY THINK ABOUT PROVISION OF THAT SOMETHING LIKE WHAT MASSACHUSETTS DID SOME STUFF THROW THAT OUT THERE. OKAY SO LET'S MOVING ASIDE OFTEN THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN TERMS OF THE SUBSIDIES I I KNOW THAT -- AND I APPRECIATE DAILY -- BRING THIS UP TO AND LEARN ABOUT THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SUBSIDIES VARYING FROM YEAR TO YEAR. RIGHT AND PEOPLE NOT ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT'S GOING TO BE BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON YOU KNOW I MEAN PEOPLE OF ALL OUR BUDGET THAT CLOSELY. AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT GONNA KNOW HOW MUCH AND IT IN BECAUSE ACTUALLY IS IS THAT THE THE COLLECTOR TOBACCO TAX I MEAN ULTIMATELY ACTUALLY WOULD I'D BE THRILLED IF THE PENALTY WAS ZERO THEY AT ME AND THAT WE HAVE EVERYONE SIGNED UP RIGHT I MEAN THAT THAT THAT. THAT WOULD BE THAT THE WONDERFUL -- AND SO THE CHALLENGE THEN IS IS THAT I COULD IMAGINE THAT WILL HAPPEN IS YOU WE SET FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WE SAID A SUBSIDY A CERTAIN LEVEL. AND ACTUALLY PEOPLE SAY OKAY THAT'S OF THE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD IT'S ON A BY HEALTH INSURANCE RIGHT PENALTY WILL GO DOWN. RIGHT BECAUSE THE CELL THE RATES OF MORE PEOPLE SIGN UP. THE NEXT YEAR I HAVE THIS OF PEOPLE SIGN UP AND NOW WE HAVE A SMALLER POOL AND WE SAID WELL NOW YOUR SUBSIDY SHRINKING AND THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE GOING WELL THE SUBSIDIES LESS I'M GONNA TAKE THE PENALTY AGAIN. AND SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN AND PEOPLE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PREDICT IN GAME THIS IS THEY ARE THAT IT'S AN GAMES ISM SURVEY RATED THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE FINANCIAL DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. AND SO I DO THINK THAT THAT THAT'S REALLY. THAT'S GOING TO CREATE SOME -- BONELLI INSTABILITYIT MAY ACTUALLY CREATE THIS TRUST I MEAN TRUST IS A REAL IMPORTANT PART ABOUT HEALTHCARE RIGHT. AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS. SO I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT HAVING THAT KIND IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE TO PEOPLE RIGHT SO I YEAH THIS WAS. THE GOVERNOR'S GOING OUT THERE SAYING WE ARE BOTH GONE REQUIRE YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE. BUT WE CAN'T TELL YOU HOW AFFORDABLE IT'S GOING TO BE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY'S GOING TO COME IN FROM YEAR TO YEAR RIGHT. ANY OF YOU HOW HOW HOW MUCH LEAD TIME REAL WARM PEOPLE I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW WE'RE SITTING THERE GOING WELL YOU KNOW. WORDS WILL THE REASON WE DO MAY REVISE AS WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY HE IS GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL IF SO HOW MUCH LEAD TIME GIVE GIVE PEOPLE TO PLAN WHEN THEY PURCHASE RATE AND AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS -- WOOD. SO ANYWAY THE KEY CAN YOU. HAPPY TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE QUESTIONS SO WE HAVE DEFINITELY HEARD THOSE CONCERNS I THINK THE FIRST THING TO NOTE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING A SUBSIDY PROGRAM TO SINCE THE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THREE COVERAGE YEARS. AGAIN AS MENTIONED IN MY PRESENTATION I THINK THE INTENT. IS TO CALL UPON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN AND HELP CALIFORNIANS OTHER STATES ADDRESS THESE LARGER AFFORDABILITY QUESTIONS THAT MAY TAKE ANOTHER ELECTION -- RELATED TO THE VOLATILITY OF THE REVENUE ESTIMATES I THINK FOR THIS FIRST YEAR IT'S GOING TO BE -- VERY CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN FRANCHISE TAX OARD AND COVERED CALIFORNIA AND FINANCING THIS BUDGET COMMITTEES TO KIND OF SETTLE ON THE REVENUE NUMBER AND I DON'T THINK THAT NUMBER WILL BE ADJUSTED IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS BECAUSE OUR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NOT GONNA COME IN. UNTIL APRIL. TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF WHICH WILL LIKELY HAVE A SO WILL LIKELY HAVE A SIMILAR REVENUE PROJECTION FOR THE FIRST AND SECOND YEAR OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAM [inaudible] OF AGAIN THE EFFECTS OF THAT MAY BE FELT IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THE PROPOSED COVERAGE YEARS BUT AGAIN WOULD NOTE THAT. THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL IS TO MAKE COVERAGE MORE FORMAL TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. WHILE ALSO IMPLEMENTING THIS BUT BY WILD TYING IN THE SCHOOLS HIS PENALTY REVENUE. IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR BROADER BUDGET DISCUSSIONS [inaudible] I AND THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COMMITTEE PROCESS THESE. AND CAN YOU JUST ALSO CLARIFY UNDERSTAND THE PART THE PROPOSAL ALSO IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO GUESTS RATE A LITTLE BIT IN THE BEGINNING. DURING A PROJECT X. AMOUNT OF DEAL FIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OR SOME AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND IF IT TURNS OUT WHAT WE COLLECT IN THE PENALTY IS NOT AS MUCH AS WE EXPECT ARE WE PLAYING TO THE AND SUBS IT FILL THAT IN WITH GENERAL FUND OR DRAW DOWN IN FUTURE YEARS NOW WE HAVE EVEN SMALLER PULL IN THE FUTURE YEAR. TO PROVIDE SO WHAT IS THE THE WHY IS. THE AMOUNT SPECIFIED FOR EACH COVERAGE YOUR WOULD BE. DEBATE IN NEGOTIATING THESE BUDGET COMMITTEE IS COVERED CALIFORNIA RCEIVE THAT NUMBER. IN JUNE WHEN THE BUDGET IS PASSED AND THEY WILL DESIGN THEIR SUBSIDY PROGRAM BASED ON THE NUMBER AND THAT. WILL INFORM THE SUBSIDIES AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO PURCHASE COVERAGE DURING OPEN ENROLLMENT OCTOBER TO JANUARY. ONCE THOSE INDIVIDUAL SET THEIR SUBSIDY AMOUNT IS NOT OUR INTENT THAT THAT AMOUNT FOR THAT COVERAGE YOU'RE BE ADJUSTED DOWNWARD UPWARD. HOWEVER YOU ARE CORRECT THAT IF THE PROGRAMS ARE OVER EXTENDED IN THAT COVERAGE HERE BECAUSE WE DO NOT. WE UNDERESTIMATED REVENUES -- UNDERESTIMATE EXPANSIONS WE WOULD LIKE THE PROPOSED TO REDUCE THE SUBSEQUENT FUNDING AMOUNT AND THE NEXT YEAR BASED OFF THOSE ACTUAL THAT WE'VE RECEIVED OKAY SO -- SO AGAIN I AM FIRST OF ALL I A AGREE IN SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT CHANGE IT WITHIN THE PLAN YEAR. WHY I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SORRY I WAS A PHYSICS MADE BY A PHYSICS MAJOR SO -- SO WHAT I SEE IS A ESSENTIALLY CREATING THIS OR WAVE A FACT BECAUSE WILL HAPPEN IS IS THAT. WE DELIVERY TALKING ABOUT PERTURBATIONS IN THE SYSTEM WHERE OKAY WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IS THAT WE PROVIDE A SUBSIDY MORE PEOPLE HOPEFULLY I MEAN THAT'S THE INTENT. ARE ABLE TO SIGN OFF. THAT IS THE PENALTY GOES DOWN. I AND WE OVER GUESS HOW MUCH AGAIN THE PENALTY THAT WILL HAPPEN IS NOW ONLY OF COURSE WILL THE SUB TO GO DOWN THE FOLLOWING YEAR EVERY ESSAY WILL NOW GOING. BRING BACK SOME OF THAT MONEY TO FILL IN THE BACK FILL THAT POOL GETS EVEN SMALLER NOW THAT SUBSIDY DROPS EVEN MORE. AND THEN WILL HAPPEN IS THAT I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE NOT A CHANGE WITHIN YOUR BILL WHEN THEY LOOK AT THAT YEAR TING I LIKE WAIT A MINUTE WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SUBSIDY RIGHT AND I WAS PLANNING ON BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT RIGHT NOW. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PLAN I HAVE NOW? I'D LIKE TO KEEP IT BUT NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE I HAVE A SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE [inaudible] A LOT. LESS MANAGEABLE BECAUSE THE SUBSIDIES ARE MUCH LESS RIGHT. AND I THINK I THINK TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT RIGHT MEAN IT THE S. SO. I'M NOT SURE WE'RE SENDING THE RIGHT MESSAGE THEN AND AND I'M AFRAID THAT ACTUALLY BY. SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING TO THEN TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM A FUTURE YEAR. WE'RE ACTUALLY MAGNIFYING THIS EFFECT RIGHT SO -- NOW I I THINK ALL TOGETHER I WOULD THINK OF A MORE STABLE FUNDING BASE FUNDING SOURCE SO LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE FOR JUST A MOMENT WHEN WE COME BACK TO THAT. BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY IS THAT WE WOULD MAKE A HELL OF BEST GAS BUT IT TURNS OUT WE GOT CLOUD BACK. THAT'S GOING TO BY DESIGN MAGNIFIED THE VERY PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO WE'RE COMPOUNDING IT BY SAYING THAT NOT ONLY OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO BASE IT ON WHAT THE PENALTY'S GOING TO BE. WE'RE THEN GOING TO IF WE GUESS WRONG AND WE OVER ESTIMATED WE'RE GONNA TAKE EVEN MORE MONEY FROM THE FUTURE YEAR AND THEREFORE SHRINK THE SUBS EVEN MORE. AND I THINK THE THE RESPONSE FROM PEOPLE ARE PURCHASING INSURANCE IS GOING TO BE WELL I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO BUY SOMETHING WHERE I CAN'T GET THERE. I MEAN I GUESS PEOPLE CANNELLA BY THIS YEAR WILL BY NEXT YEAR BY THE END FOLLOWING YEAR BUT I I JUST THINK THAT -- THAT INVOLVED THAT VOLATILITY IS GOING TO UNDERMINES PEOPLE'S. DESIRE TO LOSE WELL THAT'S FOR THIS WAY COVER CALIFORNIA ANSWER THIS U AND A ONE THE CHALLENGES BEEN COVERED CALIFORNIA IS IS THAT -- IF YOU ACTUALLY TRIED AND BOOKED EACH YEAR IS IT JUST RENEWED YOUR SAME PLAN AND LOOKED AT THE PREMIUMS AND WE HAVE STANDARDIZED BENEFITS THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY THE V. ACTUALLY THE AMOUNT THAT THE PLAN COSTS EACH YEAR ACTUALLY DOESN'T GO UP. QUITE AS MUCH RIGHT BUT ACTUALLY INTERESTING PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW FAST THE PLAN GOES UP IS BECAUSE THEY GENERALLY WE ACTUALLY TRY TO STICK TO THE SAME PLAN THEY DON'T ALWAYS SHOP AGAIN THEY SERVE THE SHOP THE FIRST YEAR. AND THEN THEY KIND OF AND THEY GO WELL LOOK MY PLAN WHAT BUT GUESS WHAT THERE'S ANOTHER PLANTS A LITTLE CHEAPER OH OH WELL I DIDN'T REALLY AND HOW CAN THAT IT'S RIGHT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE END UP DOING A LOT. THE THERE ARE DYNAMICS AND SO THE TAX CREDITS TIED TO THE SECOND LOS COSTS OVER PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW THAT SO THEY THEY FEEL THE DYNAMICS OF THEIR PLANS DISTANCE GOING UP OR DOWN RELATIVE TO THAT SECOND LOS COSTS OVER AND THEN IT IT CAUSES THEM TO RETHINK AND SHOP. OKAY SO BUT BY A OF THE BEING FAIRLY. WE'RE NAMING CONSTRAINING IT TO A CERTAIN. WINDOW SO THAT LEAST SO WHAT WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED THIS OF THESE GOING TO BE CUT IN HALF. IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN TWO THIRDS IS A TO COME 210% I MEAN IF IT'S SMALL OKAY. BUT IT'S YEAR TO YEAR BUT IT'S A BIG DROP YOU KNOW A BIG IS. NOW OF COURSE TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOLDER BUT 25% 33% THAT PEOPLE MIGHT GO WELL WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. RIGHT SO. I DEFINITELY HERE CONCERNED WE WOULD JUST KNOW THAT THIS IS PROPOSING TO BUILD UPON THE EXISTING FEDERAL FRAMEWORK AND THOSE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES WOULD STILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE CONSUMERS WHO ARE PURCHASING COVERAGE ON THE HEALTHCARE MARKET. BUT AGAIN NO YOU CONCERNING HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK. OKAY SO -- CAN I GET NOW I'M GONNA GO AND MY PART TO FOR SIDE SO WHAT ABOUT A MORE STABLE FUNDING BASE -- SO. AND THEN AGAIN I UNDERSTAND -- YOU YOU PRIDE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO IT BUT SINCE YOU GOT BRING STUFF BACK -- SO SO FIRST FIRST OF ALL THIS THE SUMP THE SON AND WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS ACTUALLY WE HAD OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING WHAT WAS THE JOINT. NOT ONLY HEALTH COMMITTEES BUT BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES CAME TOGETHER. AND AND SO CERTAINLY YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED DOESN'T. YEAH ON TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF SUBSIDY WE SAW THE REPORT FROM CURRENT CALIFORNIA I'D THINK IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT MORE SUB THAT IF -- AND ALSO MORTARS TABLE AS WELL AND SO WAIT THEY THINK WHEN THE THINGS WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER -- AND CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT -- IT IS THE LEGISLATURE PATENT THAT PASSES THE BUDGET IN THE GOVERNOR SIDES FOR SIGN OR NOT BUT I'M GONNA BUT WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU -- IS AND I APPRECIATE YOU IS IS MAYBE PERHAPS LOOKING AT THE MCO TAX RATE WHICH I'VE. READ THAT THE GOVERNOR DECIDED THE LEAST IN THIS IN THE GENERAL BUDGET PROPOSAL NOT. TO RENEW AND YOU KNOW WE'LL TRY TO HAVE SOME DISCUSSION LATER ON ABOUT THE ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUING ED BUT YOU KNOW I I IN SOME SENSES IN PRINCIPLE RIGHT IT'S A TAX ON ALL MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION. ALL PLANS RIGHT AND SO WE'RE DOING SUBSIDY THROUGH CAR CALIFORNIA EVERY PLAN HAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MOST PART TO PARTICIPATE. RIGHT NOW AS WELL SO IT SORT OF BATCHES AND MAKES SOME SENSE THERE AND ALSO COOL HELD A STRAW DOUBTS MORE MONEY FOR MEDI CAL PROGRAM INCLUDING OUR MEDICAL EXPANSION -- BUT I THINK THAT CERTAINLY I REVENUE MAKES SENSE BUT THAT BEING THE PRIMARY ARE TYING THE ENTIRE SUBSIDY TO THAT. I WOULD SAVE ALL TAL INCOME SOURCE UNTIL IT'S PROVEN AS YOU CAN -- UNTIL IT WAS IMPROVE IS NOT GONNA BE SO VOLATILE -- I THINK IS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST STRATEGY WE WANT PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE THEIR PLAN WHEN WE SEE THEM ON EIGHT WHEN GOVERNOR NEWSOME GOES AND ANNOUNCES AND SAYS LOOK YOU KNOW WE ARE TAKING IT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS THING HAPPEN NOW RIGHT I PROMISE THIS IS. THE BEGIN MY TERM WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS THING HAPPEN THERE ARE PEOPLE THE NEXT THE FOLLOWING YEAR GOING WHEN WHAT HAPPENED. RIGHT ARE YOU PULLING BACK FROM THIS BECAUSE WE'VE TIED THIS ENTIRELY -- TOO SO -- SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. I KNOW YOU CAN'T SAY YES OR NO RIGHT NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS SHOWN THE MCO TAX AT THIS TIME BUT AGAIN WE WILL TAKE IT BACK. THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK RIGHT NOW. BUT IN NAY WILL BE VOTING ON STUFF SO. OKAY -- IT'S OTHER ISSUES AND AND THEN I SEE I CAN YOU ADDRESS THE THE LA -- BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE AROUND TAX CREDIT VERSES. THAT WAS IT THE ON GOING TO YOU CAN REPEAT THAT. SURE IT'S IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IN OTHER STATES THE SUBSIDIES PROVIDED TO THE INSURER SIMILAR TO AN ADVANCED CREDIT BUT THERE'S NO TRUE UP AT THE END THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM INSTEAD IT'S ADJUSTED AS THE YEAR GOES ON FOR EXAMPLE THE PLAN MIGHT GET SOME INFORMATION OR COVER CALIFORNIA. MY GET SOME INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN INCOME THEY WOULD ADJUST THE SUBSIDY PROSPECTIVELY AND THAT WOULD SORT OF BE THE END OF THE STORY SO IT'S IT'S BOUNCING BETWEEN -- PER MENTALITY VERSUS SIMPLICITY THE WOULD BE GOOD TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE THAT THE TRADE OFF THEIR OKAY AND THE SPELL YOU HAVE AND DOES SOME. YELLING IS ABOUT THAT AND WE'LL LET FINANCE ALSO WHAT THEY THINK THE TRADE OFFS OR SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS MADE PEOPLE FRUSTRATED WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS RECONCILIATION. IT'S THAT IF YOU DON'T KILL SURE INCOME CORRECTLY AND I FOR ONE DON'T KNOW WHAT MY MODIFIED ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME IS AND I BET MOST PEOPLE WITHIN THE SOUND OF MY VOICE DO NOT. IF YOU GET A GAS INCORRECTLY THEN YOU HAVE WHAT IS USUALLY FOR A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN UNHAPPY SURPRISE AT TAX TIME. PEOPLE TEND TO UNDERESTIMATE THEIR INCOME RISES IN OVERESTIMATED SO RATHER THAN CALIFORNIA THERE'S MUCH TO COMMEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT BUT CALIFORNIA HAS CONSISTENTLY IMPROVED ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IN THIS WOULD BE AN AREA WHERE WE WOULD HOPE WE WOULD IMPROVE RATHER THAN REPLICATE SOMETHING THAT WAS. AFTER ALL DESIGNED TO THE U. S. SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE THE TAX WRITING COMMITTEE RATHER THAN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE OF THE OF THE CONGRESS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT FEATURE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT. THE DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND HOW YOU THIS EITHER LAND AND HOW YOU DID OR YOUR OPENNESS TO CONSIDERING AN ALTAR IS OPTION YOU MY IS FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE I THINK FOR OUR PERSPECTIVES AGAIN TO MODELS CLOSELY TO THIS FOUNDATION THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE -- HAVING THE ABILITY TO RECONCILE IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO MAKE SURE THAT. FOLKS ARE RECEIVING THE APPROPRIATE SUBSIDY AMOUNT THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING WITH THE STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM. I THINK ADMINISTRATIVELY THERE'S ALSO QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT COVER CALIFORNIA WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS. MONTHLY THROUGHOUT THE COVERAGE HERE. ANY COMMENTS FROM COVER CALIFORNIA. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WERE READY TO WORK CLOSELY ON THIS WE DO DO THIS TODAY THROUGH THE FEDERAL SYSTEM OBVIOUSLY -- AT CONSUMERS ARE ALLOWED TO APPLY FOR SUBSIDIES BASED ON A PROJECTED ANNUAL INCOME SO TRIMMING UP AT THE END OF THE YEAR TO WHERE THE DOLLARS LAND IS. WHY THAT HAPPENS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL? OKAY AND THEN FINALLY A I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSAL -- SO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO END UP. HAVING TO PAY THE PENALTY -- WE WOULD LIKE TO BE SURE THAT THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF THEIR VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO GET ENROLLED SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE PENALTY -- THAT INCLUDES PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO MAY EVEN QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL WE WILL BE SURE TO SIGN UP. RIGHT THERE'S NO COST THAT TO THEM -- RIGHT AS WELL AS BEING SURE THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD. WHERE OF COURSE IN THAT CASE -- THEY WOULD HAVE TO AGREED. TO BE THE SITE FOR THE PLAN OR PAY THE PENALTY SO -- DOES SO. WE CAN THAT -- BY THINGS THAT THE BIGGEST. TRY TO THINK ABOUT HOW THAT INFORMATION GETS FROM HIS AT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WOULD HAVE THAT. TO COVERED CALIFORNIA. THIS WAS A I I THINK COVER CALIFORNIA'S TRY BETTER IN A BETTER PLACE TO FIGURE OUT IF I GAVE A DATA FILE ALL THE PEOPLE GOT THE PENALTY TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES I SEE. YOU SENT FOR TO DTS FOR MEDI CAL AND WHICH ONES YOU WOULD HANG ON TO TO THAT AND FOR ITEM INFORMATION ABOUT. THAT AND SAID THE FANTASTICKS WHICH I TO FIGURE OUT THOSE TWO THINGS KICKING YOU JUST SPEAK TO HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS. AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF TRYING TO AT LEAST. ALL KNOW WHAT THEIR OPPORTUNITIES TRULY ARE. ABSOLUTELY WE'VE HAD GOOD PRODUCTIVE INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ABOUT THEM SHARING DATA WITH US NOT ONLY ON PEOPLE WHO PAID THE PENALTY BUT PEOPLE WHO QUALIFIED FOR EXEMPTION SO THAT WE COULD DO EXACTLY AS YOU SAY -- PROVIDE THEM THEIR OPTIONS -- WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER WORKING WITH PEACE WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY WANT TO TIME WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OPEN ENROLLMENT -- BUT WE THINK THERE'S A GOOD PARTNERSHIP THERE I WOULD JUST SAY IN TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES -- THAT HAVE MANDATE STATE THEM WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE DATA THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO GET ACCESS TO SO THEY COULD DO THIS TYPE OF TARGETED -- OUT REACH BUT WE WOULD A PROPOSED TO TEST IT AND SEE WHAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHODS ARE. IN THIS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT SEND ALL THAT INFORMATION THAT'S INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO I THINK AGAIN I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE COVER CALIFORNIA PIECE IT'S ALSO I MEAN WE PEOPLE MIGHT OKAY YES THIRTY PEOPLE -- FOR FOR FOR MEDI CAL AS WELL CORRECT. OKAY I JUST I HEARD SOMETHING LOOK AT HER DIFFICULTY CALIFORNIA'S IDEA TO DE DE MEDI CAL PIECE. SO I THINK THAT'S NEAR WILL WILL NEED TO COORDINATE OKAY EXCELLENT AND ARE INTERESTED APPLICATION FOR COVER CALIFORNIA IS AN APPLICATION FOR MEDI CAL AS WELL. LET US MAKING IT MADE SENSE IS THE SEND THE FILE TO DISCOVER CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD GOING OKAY. WHO FITS IN THE WHICH PADRE THAT THE SORTING HAPPENS PERHAPS A COVERED CALIFORNIA? OKAY. RIGHT. OTHER QUESTIONS WE COMMUTERS OKAY ARE. EIGHT SO WE HAVE A LOT OF MESSAGES TO GO BACK -- A LOT OF MESSAGES WAITING TO HEAR ABOUT AND AGAIN I I DO WANT TO THANK AGAIN THE GOVERNOR -- FOR PUTTING THIS FORD SO I'D AT IT IS THAT THESE ALSO THE FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN WORK. TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNOR TO REALLY MAKE THIS VISION -- WORK OUT BECAUSE I ONLY BE SURE THAT SEVERAL YEARS FROM NOW -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOMETHING I KNOW YOU DO TOO AS WELL AND WHERE -- PEOPLE AT THE RECOGNIZE AND AND AND AND PRECIADO THE THE THE BENEFITS THEY'RE WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP IS IT WILL RESULT IN CELL THANK YOU. SO MUCH ALL RIGHT THANK YOU.

GREAT SO GOOD MORNING JENNIFER CAN'T WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF A HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- SO CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY --% WE ARE PROPOSING TO INCREASE FULL SCOPE COVERAGE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT SATISFACTORY DOCUMENTATION STATUS UP THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS WILL -- PROVIDE COVERAGE TO APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT WOULD COME AT A COST OF ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND -- WITH ABOUT SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS AND SO I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES -- PEOPLE ARE UNCLEAR AS TO HOW WE GET FEDERAL FUNDS FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE OTHERWISE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL SO. IN MEDI CAL TODAY WE HAVE -- APPROXIMATE ONE POINT TWO MILLION INDIVIDUALS THAT GET LIMITED SCOPE OR EMRGENCY MEDICAL COVERAGE ON THAT IS ALLOWED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE ARE FEDERAL FUNDS -- PROVIDED FOR THAT -- SO WE WHEN WE PUT INDIVIDUALS AND FULL SCOPE COVERAGE THE OTHER WAYS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR F. P. WE DO CLAIM ON THE BACK AND FOR THAT COMPLIMENTS OF THE PREMIUM THAT ARE OTHERWISE. ELIGIBLE FOR A FIVE PIECE THAT'S WHERE THE FEDERAL FUNDING I THINK THAT -- THE YOUR AGENDA DOES A NICE JOB OF I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PREVIOUS EXPANSION OF FULL SCOPE COVERAGE FOR ALL CHILDREN UP THROUGH THE AGES -- EIGHTEEN WE ARE -- ON TARGET I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR ENROLLMENT PROJECTIONS WERE WHEN WE DID THIS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO -- WE SAID THAT APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN WOULD BE ENROLLED IN RIGHT NOW WE'RE CITY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND I THINK OF THOSE IS CRAFTS. YET TURN -- SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND SO -- HOW THAT OCCURRED BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS WE SPENT -- SIX TO NINE MONTHS WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES AND R. I. T. VENDOR TO MAKE THE ELECTRONIC -- CHANGES TO OUR COLLECTIVE ENROLLMENT SYSTEMS IN WHICH WE IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN IN THE APPROPRIATE AGE RANGES IN THOSE -- LIMITED SCOPE EIGHT CATEGORIES AND WE ESSENTIALLY PUT THEM INTO FULL SCOPE AID CODES AND SO A LOT OF IT WAS AN AUTOMATED PROCESS THAT DID TAKE SOME TIME TO BOTH PROGRAM AND TEST THE SYSTEM. WE HAD TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE -- THE APPROPRIATE -- TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAN THAT A FISHERIES WE HAD TO IF THAT CHANGES CONTRACT FOR THE RULES. AND SO WE HAVE SINCE THE GOVERNOR MADE THIS PROPOSAL IN JANUARY BEEN WORKING ON ALL OF THOSE VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS AND SO PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES I'M PROVIDING US WITH STAFF AND RESOURCES -- TO CONTINUE THIS WORK -- ANNUALLY NON GOING IN TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY STAFF AS WELL AS NINETY SPECIALIST AS WELL SOME CONTRACT DOLLARS TO HELP EFFECTUALLY THE I. T. SYSTEM CHANGES AND SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS AS YOU. WOULD LIKE OKAY THANK YOU WILL TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END AND ACTUALLY.

JENNY WENT TO COURT AND A FINANCE -- SO INCONSISTENT WITH THIS ISSUE BY EXPANDING HEALTH CARE TO UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS AGE NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE WE ARE EXPECTING THAT COUNTIES COSTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES WILL BE REDUCED -- THEREFORE IN NINETEEN TWENTY THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO INCREASE THE REDIRECTION AMOUNT -- FROM THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVER INDIGENT CARE HEALTH REALIGNMENT REVENUES. THIS WOULD RESULT IN SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND SAVINGS IN THE COW WORKS ACCOUNT IN THE POWERS PROGRAM -- WE HAVE HEARD THE CONCERNS AROUND OUR PROPOSAL WE NOTE THAT AS PART OF THE MEDICAID EXPANSION TO THE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS WE THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. TO EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE THE ADDITIONAL REDIRECTION REDUCES THE GENERAL FUND COSTS TO THE EXPANSION. IN ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS WE ARE WE ARE RECEIVING DATA -- ON HOW MONEY IS SPENT BETWEEN HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND WE WILL BE ASSISTANCE COUNTIES -- FEEDBACK.

HI MY NAME IS MERRY CAM I AM THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER OF THE CREAM RESOURCE CENTER WE ARE AN IMMIGRANT RIGHTS GROUP THAT WORK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN BOTH LOS ANGELES AND FULLER -- TEN AND I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THE STORY OF MY COWORKER WHO IS OUR PARENT ORGANIZER IN IS PERSONALLY -- AND IS IN A DOCUMENT APPARENT PERSONALLY IMPACTED IF HEALTH FOR A WHICH WERE TO EXPAND -- SHE'S NOT ABLE TO JOIN US TODAY SO I'LL BE SHARING HER STORY FOR HER IN A FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE. MY NAME IS ERICA CAM AND I'VE LIVED IN BORN APART CALIFORNIA FOR TEN YEARS AND MY HUSBAND AND I ARE BOTH UNDOCUMENTED. MY HUSBAND IS A LIVING AS A HOUSE PAINTER AND HE SPENDS LONG HOURS LABORING TO BEAUTIFY PEOPLE'S HOMES AND PROTECT THEM FROM CORROSION. THREE YEARS AGO HE BEGAN TO PERIODICALLY COMPLAIN OF INDIGESTION BUT DUE TO OUR FINANCIAL SITUATION WE CANNOT GO TO SEE A DOCTOR. AFTER A FEW MONTHS IN THAT CONDITION I RECEIVED A CALL FROM MY HUSBAND'S BOSS ONE DAY SAYING THAT HE SUDDENLY STARTED THROWING UP BLOOD WHILE WORKING AND HAD COLLAPSED. I REST MY HUSBAND'S WORKPLACE AND WHEN I ARRIVED HE HAD LOST SO MUCH BLOOD THAT HE COULD NOT EVEN WALK. ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL HE COMMITTED CONTINUE TO VOMIT BLOOD AND EVENTUALLY BEGAN TO LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS. I WANTED TO CALL 911- BUT EVEN AS HE WAS LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS MY HUSBAND INSISTED THAT I NOT CALL AN AMBULANCE BECAUSE OF OUR IMMIGRATION STATUS. I FELT SO FRUSTRATED IN THAT MOMENT IT SO MUCH BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SEE A DOCTOR TO A POINT WHERE HE COULD POTENTIALLY DIE BUT JUST BECAUSE OF HIS STATUS HE WAS STILL AFRAID OF ANY CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD COME WITH SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION. HOWEVER I CAN ONLY THINK OF SAVING MY HUSBAND'STHE DESPITE HIS PROTESTS I CALL 911-2 HELP TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL. WHEN WE ARRIVED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM THE NURSE SAID HE HAD LOST SO MUCH BLOOD THAT IF WE ARRIVED EVEN JUST MOMENTS LATER HE WOULD HAVE DIED? WHILE YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH THAT AT THE TIME HE WAS OFFERED EMERGENCY SERVICES CURRENTLY WE ARE BACK AT SQUARE ONE BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS ANY HEALTH CARE SINCE HE HAD BEEN RELEASED FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOM. I AM AFRAID EVERYDAY THAT A SITUATION LIKE THIS WILL OCCUR AGAIN. MY HUSBAND AND I WORK HARD AND PAY TAXES LIKE EVERY CALIFORNIAN BUT BECAUSE OF OUR STATUS WE ARE INELIGIBLE FOR PREVENTATIVE CARE THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED US AVOID SITUATIONS LIKE MY HUSBAND. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS INVESTMENT BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH FOR PEOPLE LIKE US [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS RONALD COMING HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WE THANK DOCTOR PAN IN THE SUB COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT ON THE EXPANSION OF FULL SCHOOL MEDI CAL TWIN BACK MANY CALIFORNIANS. HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA'S THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION COMMITTED TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL TO ALL UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS UP TO AGE TWENTY SIX WITH INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. BUILDING ON HEALTH FOR OUR KIDS IN COVERING UP TO LIKE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND MORE LIVES IN OUR STATE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL CALIFORNIA WOULD BE THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO EXPAND. TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT ADULTS IN THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH CARE PROGRAM WE ARE THRILLED THAT DH CS HAS BEGUN TO WORK ON IMPLEMENTATION AND WORK ON IDENTIFYING THE NEEDS AND PROCEDURAL HURDLES FOR THE VARIOUS SUBPOPULATIONS AMONG THE YOUNG ADULT POPULATION IN ORDER TO OPEN ENROLLMENT. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER JULY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN HOWEVER AS PART OF THE YOUNG ADULTS EXPANSION THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED THAT SIXTY THREE MILLION OF THE TOTAL FUNDING FOR THIS EXPANSION BE OFFSET. FROM REDUCTION OF FUNDING TO COUNTIES TO COVER MEDICALLY INDIGENT REMAINING UNINSURED POPULATIONS THE REVISION OF EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE REALIGNMENT WELL SOME COUNTIES PROVIDE LITTLE OR NO CARE THERE ARE ALSO MANY COUNTIES THAT HAVE OFFERED TO EXTEND MEDICAL HOMES. AND ACCESS TO CARE FOR THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION WE BELIEVE THAT ANY NEW FORMULA MUST MAKE CERTAIN THAT IS PROPORTIONATE TO THE DECREASING COSTS OF THE REMAINING UNINSURED. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT ALSO LEAVES COUNTIES IN THE TO THE MEDICALLY INDIGENT REMAINING UNINSURED INCLUDING THE END DOCUMENT WHILE ALSO BEING ABLE TO CONTINUALLY RESOURCE THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S VISION AND COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. AND ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO BUILD ON THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT AS WE KNOW ALL UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM THESE UNJUST EXCLUSIONS UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. OVER TWENTY SIX ARE OFTEN TO THE CARETAKERS PARENTS GRANDPARENTS AND GIVE ME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS OVER TWENTY SIX OFTEN THE CARETAKERS PARENTS GRANDPARENTS OF THE KIDS AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE BUT WHO WOULD STILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CARE THEMSELVES. EXPANDING MEDICAL TO ALL LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. WOULD EXPAND ELIGIBILITY TO APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE FIVE MILLION ADULTS BY TWENTY TWENTY REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S UNINSURED RATE BY A QUARTER. ONE MILLION PEOPLE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO ENROLL IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THEY ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN. RESTRICTED CODE MEDI CAL TODAY HOWEVER ACCORDING TO THE LATEST REPORT BY THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER DEPENDING ON HOW PUBLIC CHARGE RULES ARE FINALIZED PROJECTED ENROLLMENT COULD GET BY AS MUCH AS 30%. DOWN TO ABOUT SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHICH MAY MEAN THAT THERE COULD BE LOWER STATE COSTS CERTAINLY THAT ALSO MAKES THE POINT THAT SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL TRYING TO MAKE YESTERDAY AND OR THE THE POINT THAT SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL. MADE YESTERDAY AND SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE ABOUT THE NEED TO INSURE -- COUNTIES -- CONTINUED WOULD BE A PLACE FOR ENROLLMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY DESCEND ROLE FROM THE STATE'S OFTEN OVERLOOKED MANY UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ACTUALLY HAVE EMPLOYMENT BASED JOB COVERAGE HOWEVER FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS LIKE THEY'RE LAWFULLY PRESENT COUNTERPARTS THEY'RE NOT OFFER JOB BASED COVERAGE. FOR LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS 89% ARE UNINSURED COMPAREDTO NINE FIRST 11% OF THEIR LAWFULLY PRESENT COUNTERPARTS AS WITH OFTEN IS WITH THESE PRESENTATION ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS EXTREMELY LIMITED IN COMPREHENSIVE CARES DESPERATELY NEED NEEDED. CURRENTLY AT THE UNDOCUMENTED OR READY ELIGIBLE FOR ALL IT DOESN'T STABILIZE YOU IT DOES NOT TREAT YOU FOR WHAT MAY ACTUALLY BE A CHRONIC DISEASE. IT DOESN'T COME WITH PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER A MEDICAL HOME PREVENTIVE CARE SERVICES FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY LIVE. SOME UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS MAY ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO COUNTY HEALTH PROGRAMS AS WE MENTIONED HOWEVER IN RURAL AREAS -- THIS IS A DOCUMENT POPULATION OFTEN DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF ACCESS SOME SIMPLY GO WITHOUT CARE OR RESORT FEW HOME REMEDIES PEOPLE ARE OFTEN LIVING SICKER DYING YOUNGER AND HAVE POOR POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE ALSO MEANS THAT YOU COULD BE ONE SICKNESS OR INJURY AWAY FROM. FINANCIAL CALAMITY DUE TO HIGH MEDICAL BILLS OR FINANCIAL DEBT CALIFORNIA WILL LIKELY NEVER BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF POVERTY IN OUR STATE WITHOUT ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND ECONOMIC SUPPORT. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOU TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT THAT BUILDS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE IN OUR STATE SUFFERS OR DIES FROM EASILY TREATABLE ILLNESS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- ASSUME STRUGGLING MAJOR THAT YOUR WITNESS WAS YOUR TESTIMONY I SEE IS ALL YOUR TIME. EXTREMELY SHORT OF THOUGHT SO VERY SHORT THANK YOU I'M SECOND DIPPING AGNETHA COUGHING AROUND POLICY CENTER -- WOULD LOVE TO UPLIFT WHAT -- MISTER COLEMAN JUST SAID BY AN INVISIBLE CRITIC BUT CRITICAL RESEARCH ASKING FOR THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT TO EXTEND TO ALL THIS YEAR IS BECAUSE OF THAT SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES MAKE TORSO ECONOMY TO THEIR WORK. HI IN FROM. AGRICULTURE TO CONSTRUCTION DOMESTIC WORKERS TO CAROL CARETAKERS TO SERVICE WORK THERE HI ON THE JOB IN A HIGH ENTRY FIELDS AND WE THINK THAT. THE CONTRIBUTIONS THEY MAKE ARE REALLY CRITICAL TO OUR STATE AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TAKES ON HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO ALL ADULTS THINK. THANK YOU A DOCTOR BILLS AND DOCTOR PAN I SEE YOU AGAIN CENTER -- NOT PETER BEYOND CINEMA DIRECTORS SACRAMENTO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES TALKING TO SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE CHANGE IN THE SIXTY FORTY REALIGNMENT. AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT IF COUNTIES INCLUDING IN OURS AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA HAS SPIKING COMMITTEES HONOREE AND SURPLUS RATES. SOME OF THEM THREE FOLD GREATER THAN THEY WERE THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO WE DON'T WANNA HAVE TO CLOSE STD CLINICS AND DISEASE -- INVESTIGATORS AND PROGRAMS LIKE THAT WHEN I'M TALKING TODAY. ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS US IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND AGAIN ALTHOUGH THIS IS A VERY LAUDABLE GOAL. THERE ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THE TOTAL LOSS TO SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH FUNDS CRITICAL COUNTY HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING PRIMARY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AS YOU KNOW CENTR. FOR FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE PATIENTS AND ARE HEALTHY PARTNERS UNDOCUMENTED PROGRAM IN SACRAMENTO COUNTIES FQHC PAID FOR BY SACRAMENTO COUNTY -- AND WITH THIS WAS START IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AS YOU KNOW -- WALLY Là THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS DESIRE TO PROVIDE FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL TO ADULTS NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE IRONICALLY. THIS RESULTS IN A DECREASED TO NINETY SEVEN POINT 5% OF OUR UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION THAT WERE SERVING BECAUSE ONLY A HUNDRED OF OUR FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS. ACTS OR TWO POINT 5% ARE ACTUALLY NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE AND AS YOU ALL KNOW. THEY ARE THE LEAST EXPENSIVE. THE MOST LIKELY EXPENSIVE CONDITION AND CONDITIONS ON A GOOD WORD CAN SERVICE THEY'RE LIKELY TO GET IS -- WE CARE WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR SO YOU'RE BASICALLY BITING OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE OR WHATEVER THE APPROPRIATE ANALOGY AS IN ADDITION AS AS YOU KNOW CENTER WE HAVE A NEW -- AT A NEW CONTRACT WITH UC DAVIS TO PROVIDE A MEDICARE A SEASON TO PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO FIVE THOUSAND NEW MEDI CAL. RECIPIENTS AND THE CUTS IN OUR FOR FQHC FOR THIS BILL IN TERMS OF UC DAVIS PROVIDERS WILL ALSO BE HAVE A DRAMATIC EFFECT ON THOSE FOLKS AS WELL. SO FOR THAT REASON ALTHOUGH WE THINK IT'S A LOT OF GOALIE REGRETTABLY WANT TO OPPOSE THIS THANK YOU. RIGHT -- QUESTION OF ELIA COMMENTS YES. A BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA SHOW -- WE HAVE -- PERFORMED AN ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXTEND COVERAGE -- TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AGES NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE AND WE'VE WE'VE WE FIND THAT THIS RELIGIOUS PRESENTS LEGISLATURE WITH. AN OPPORTUNITY CHOOSE AMONG ITS PRIORITIES POPULATION TO EXPAND -- EXPAND COVERAGE TO AND WHERE DEVOTE ITS RESOURCES THERE -- WE DO -- RAISE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- AND CONCERNS AROUND THE ESTIMATE IT THE ESTIMATED COST OF THE EXPANSION -- FIRST WE WOULD NOTE THAT AT LEAST IN THE FIRST YEAR THE COSTS ARE LIKELY OVERSTATED -- FOR ONE IMPLEMENTATION IS LIKELY NOT TO OCCUR ON JULY FIRST BUT IS LIKELY TO TAKE SOME TIME TO ULTIMATELY IMPLEMENT SO -- THERE MIGHT BE HALF YOUR COSTS ARE THREE FORCE HERE COSTS OR SO FORTH IN THE FIRST YEAR. SECOND WE FIND THAT THE CASELOAD ESTIMATE -- FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IS LIKELY SOMEWHAT OVERSTATED -- THE ASSUMPTION THEY THEY SUMA RATHER THE ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES A RATHER HIGH TAKE UP RATE THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO OCCUR. AND SO WE WOULD -- ADVISE THAT THE LEGISLATURE -- GIVEN THIS ASSUMPTION BY PROBABLY AROUND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS -- WE ALSO -- IT BOTH IN OUR ANALYSIS OF THE MEDICAL BUDGET AS WELL AS A SUBSEQUENT REPORT -- THAT WE RELEASED TO ANALYZING -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED CHANGES TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT -- WE RAISE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AROUND THE PROPOSED REDIRECTION OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM COUNTY INDIGENT -- HEALTH FUNDING AND SO. AND WE FIND WHILE WE FIND THAT SOME REDIRECTION IS LIKELY APPROPRIATE GIVEN ONE THERE IS GOOD THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE SOMEWHAT LOWER COSTS WHILE FOR INDIGENT CARE FOLLOWING THIS PROPOSAL. AND TO THAT WE WHEN WE SET THE THE RATE AT 60% WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY GET THAT RIGHT AS A STATE -- THAT WOULD THAT WAS A PROJECTION AND SO THE ACA UNDER THE ACA TAKE UP FOR MEDI CAL COVERAGE AN OLD AND OTHERWISE HAS BEEN QUITE HIGH. AND SUBSEQUENTLY WE ALSO EXPANDED COVERAGE TO UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN THROUGH SB SEVENTY FIVE WE DID NOT -- TIES THAT EXPANSION FUNDING SO WE DO THINK THAT SOME REDUCTION -- OR SOME REDIRECTION OF FUNDING FROM -- COUNTY HEALTH REALIGNMENT TO THE GENERAL FUND TO OFFSET THE COST OF THIS THIS AND OTHER EXPANSIONS COULD BE APPROPRIATE BUT WE DO QUESTION THE MAGNITUDE AND SCOPE. FOR ONE WE THINK THAT -- THE THE RE DIRECTION AT THIS LEVEL LEASE FOR CERTAIN COUNTIES IS LIKELY -- TO IMPACT EXISTING FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES AS OPPOSED ENGINE CARE HOW HEALTH INDIGENT CARE ACTIVITIES AND SO THAT -- IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT CONSIDER -- IN ADDITION IT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ONGOING VIABILITY OF COUNT OF COUNTY INDIGENT HEALTH FOR THOSE COUNTY STATE -- RUN THROUGH THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM AS THIS PROPOSAL IS IT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN IN THAT COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES UP PROGRAM NOT RECEIVING ANY FUNDING WHAT -- FOR OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND SO FORTH AND SO WHILE THEY DO HAVE RESERVES THAT THEY COULD SPEND DOWN -- IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION OF THEIR ONGOING VIABILITY -- IN LIGHT OF THIS -- THIS PROPOSED [inaudible] THANK YOU THANK YOU. RISEN THIS -- YOU GAVE A PRESENTATION FINANCE THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMON. HELLO MISTER WHAT ALBUM AND TICKETS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE INCREASE RE DIRECTION WILL RESULTS LIKE MY COLLEAGUE SAID IN A AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND SAVINGS WHICH IS. APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF THE COST -- TO COVER THE YOUNG ADULT EXPANSION ON THE MEDI CAL SITE AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT -- THIS IS REASONABLE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE ALSO MENTIONED -- WE ARE RECEIVING DATA FROM THE COUNTIES AND LOOKING AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPENDITURES COMPARED TO THEIR HEALTH INDIGENT EXPENDITURES SO -- WE ARE TAKING THAT FEEDBACK. OKAY THANK YOU. RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. OKAY WELL I ALWAYS HAVE SOME QUESTIONS SO -- THANK YOU. FOR PRESENTATIONS AND FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AND DESIRE TO BUILD ON WHAT WE FOR YOU SEE DID YOUR AND CITY CALIFORNIA TO BE SURE WE GOT ALL OUR KIDS COVERAGE AND MOVE ON TO TO NOW EXPAND. TO A YOUNG ADULT AGE NO JUST YESTERDAY IN THIS VERY ROOM -- WE ALSO -- PASSED FOR THE BILL -- TO TRY TO GO EVEN BEYOND THAT -- ALTHOUGH I'D MAKE NOTES SAID THAT IS A POLICY COMMITTEE DIDN'T HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH THE FISCAL ISSUES AND THIS IS NOW A FISCAL COMMITTEE THAT WE'RE TALKING HERE -- SO BUT FIRST OF ALL LET ME -- ASK I DO NEED TO TOUCH ON THE REALIGNMENT ISSUE -- BECAUSE AS A AND I APPRECIATE. IT'S BEEN BECAUSE THAT YOU MENTION IT THIS IS A THIRD OF THE FUNDING THAT SAID IS REQUIRED BUT ALSO WHAT I HEARD FROM DOCTOR BILL ANSON WHO AS THAT SECOND COUNTY AND I'M SURE WE CAN ASK OTHER COUNTIES. OF THE FOUR THOUSAND THAT HE'S COVERING WITH C. MICE P. ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND HEY ARE PROBABLY THE BY I DON'T KNOW THE I DON'T KNOW THAT MY NAME AND KNOW EXACTLY CONDITIONS THEY HAVE BUT PROBABLY STATISTICALLY -- LESS LIKELY TO THE PROBABLY ARE LOW. AS INDIVIDUALS FRY ON AVERAGE. LESS COSTLY AS WELL SO -- SO EIGHT SEE IS THIS I ACTUALLY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING NOTES FOR THIS WAY IF WE ACTUALLY MOVED AND WE SAID WE COVERED EVERYONE I WAS UNDOCUMENTED -- THEN. OKAY THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT'S A MUCH BIGGER -- REPLACEMENT FOR PEOPLE IS FOR ALL THE AND DOCUMENT OR SEEN AS HE AND I GAS COUNTY OF THE FOUR THOUSAND OF YOU TO CALL EVERYONE WHO WAS UNDOCUMENTED BUT WE'RE ONLY DOING. UP TO TWENTY SIX IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TAKING THAT MUCH MONEY IS DISPROPORTIONATE AND WE'VE BILL HAD PRESENTATIONS ABOUT NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST. SEE MY SP IT'S PUBLIC HEALTH WE HAD A HEARING ON PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE ACTUALLY THE UNDERSTAFFED TING OVER PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHICH HAVE NOT RECOVERED SINCE THE THE GREAT RECESSION -- MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT AND THAT'S PART OF NINE ONE REALIGNMENT HSS HEART OF NINE ONE REALIGNMENT. SO -- I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED -- ABOUT THIS IN PLEASE AND THEIR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES -- THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH DUTIES IF -- PARTICULAR FOR THE SIXTY FORTY COUNTIES WE MOVE IT UP 275% I DON'T SEE. HOW US PROVIDING HEALTHCARE COVERAGE? TO UP TO AGE. TWENTY SIX IS THE FINANCIALLY EQUIVALENT -- TO TO THAT PORTION THAT SUCH A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE REALIGNMENT BEING THEN CALL BACK TO THE STATE. SO I MEAN IS IT WAS AT THAT AND I AM NOT SURE WHO DID THE ORIGINAL CALCULATION I DOESN'T JUST THE MAKES SENSE TO ME FROM THE FROM THE FACE OF IT SO. CAN YOU GET IT IS THERE A COMMITMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION FOR HALF OF IT AT LEAST THAT MINIMUM WIND THIS UP SO THAT THERE IT'S THERE ARE SOME A BETTER FINANCIAL COURSE. FUNDING -- ISSUE THERE. THE MISTER CHURCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS -- TO CLARIFY THE CM IS P. COUNTIES THEMSELVES WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE INCREASE FOR DIRECTION -- JUST THE CMS BE BORED -- AND WE NOTE LIKE THE ALLEY -- NOTED THAT THERE -- SITTING ON A VERY SICK OVER THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION. TO CLARIFY THE THE CMS BE COMPONENT THE OTHER FIVE COUNTIES -- THEY WILL BE IMPACTED SACRAMENTO COUNTY -- PLASTER I BELIEVE YEAH WELL FIVE COUNTIES -- SO TO HAVE THAT REPRESENT ONE OF THEM YES. YEAH AND SO -- LIKE DAILY -- NOTED WE DIDN'T -- MODIFIED THE RE DIRECTION NOW WHEN WE EXPANDED TO THE YOUNG ADULT POPULATION -- WHICH AS DIRECTOR CAN'T MENTION THAT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CHILDREN PLUS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND SO BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE -- I WENT TO AN ANALYSIS BY COUNTY OR BY POPULATION AGAIN WE ARE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- PROPOSAL AT SEVENTY FIVE SEEMS RE. OKAY WELL FOR FIRST OF ALL I'D SAY THAT SOMEONE HAS A LARGER RESERVE LANDS YOU'RE CHANGING THE ACTUAL FORMULA SO EVEN ONCE THAT RESERVE GOES YEARS SO I MEAN IT'S GREAT SAY WELL SIR THERE'S A POOL OF MONEY THERE MAYBE SHOULD JUST TALK ABOUT NEGOTIATE HOW MUCH THAT PULL. GETS PUT IN AND NOT MAKE A FORMAL ONGOING BASIS -- BUT I MEAN IT'S A DEGREE THE SIXTY FORTY AYE AYE AND BECAUSE WE'LL THE PROBLEM IS AND WE'VE START PEELING AWAY AT NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT -- YELL LAST HEARING WILL TALK WAY TO ASSESS WILL BE LOOKING AT IT AGAIN -- I THINK. TO YEAH I I THINK WE NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE'RE TEAM THREE OTHER DISAPPEAR SO MANY THINGS TIED TO THIS RIGHT. AND AND SO -- I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT THIS HAS. NOT JUST ON THE COUNTY BUT THE COUNTY'S ABILITY DELIVER TO KIND OF SERVICES WE NEED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC I MEAN THAT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH ABOUT. RIGHT IT'S OUR IT'S OUR POLICE FORCE AGAINST DISEASES. AND WE HAVE A STD OUT BILL WE HAVE SED CRISIS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE CHILDREN BEING BORN WITH SYPHILIS. SHOULD THAT BE HAPPENING CITY CALIFORNIA IT'S A TREATABLE DISEASE. RIGHT BUT PEOPLE CAN'T GET THEIR STD CARE. RIGHT BECAUSE WE'VE UNDER CUT THAT. WE HAVE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE YOUR OUTBREAKS WITH IT I'LL TELL YOU -- THE RECENT POLLS SAID IT SAID SAID THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS ON THE TOP CONCERNS RATE ACTUALLY EVEN TERMS OF FEEL WHAT THE PEOPLE WANTED PEOPLE SITTING ON HEALTH CARE ACCESS WAS HE WON WELL IT'S ACTUALLY MENTAL HEALTH. WELL THAT'S NINE ONE REALIGNMENT AGAIN [inaudible] RIGHT. SO YOU KNOW ALSO I IT IS I THINK THERE'S A REAL CONCERN THAT THE WAY THE FAN AND ACTUALLY I POSE AND THAT THE ART DIRECTOR CAN'T HEAR AND I APPRECIATE HER ANSWERS LIKE. SO HOW IT HOW IS IT BY THE WAY ON THE MEDI CAL SIDE WE DO THE MENTAL HEALTH PIECE HOUSE THE THE MAN DIDN'T EACH COUNTY LIGHTING UP THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY HAVE BECAUSE WE SIR SAID OKAY WILL GUESS WHAT YOUR LINE ON THE LINE IT DOESN'T OUT. OF MONEY YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH WILL YEAH. YOUR YOUR SALES TAX SENIOR LICENSE VEHICLE LICENSE FEES NOT EXACTLY TIED TO THE NUMBER OF CARS YOU HAVE AND HOW MANY HOW MUCH PEOPLE SHOP MAYBE MAYBE IF YOU'RE BORED TO PASS YOU SHOT MORE I WHO KNOWS. MAYBE THERE'S SOME CORRELATION WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH DEMAND PROBABLY NOT TO THE PROPER. AND THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY AVAILABLE -- FOR MENTAL HEALTH IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES BASIN THAT COMPARED TO WHAT THE DEMAND IS I KNOW IT'S COMPLEX QUESTION THAT THAT'S WHAT DIRECTORS AND I AGREE WITH HER THERE. THAT'S A COMPLEX QUESTION YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE ACTUAL DEMAND BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO SO. BEFORE WE START TINKERING AROUND WITH THIS THING AND AND IT DID IT DID IT LIKE THAT THE SIX SIXTY THREE MILLION A LOT OF MONEY. IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS WE MIGHT THINK THAT IS THAT THE RIGHT POT TO GO FOR TO TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT SPECIALLY GIVEN ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT IMPACTS SO. SAYS TO FOR THAT. SOME HOPING THAT WE CAN REVISIT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS HAS AN IMPACT GOOD BECAUSE THERE'S ALL AYE A SUPPORT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING THAT WE PROVIDE THE COVERAGE THAT TWENTY SIX I'M HOPING WE CAN EVEN GO FARTHER. I THE CONCERNED AT THE FINANCING MECHANISM INCLUDES A PIECE THAT HAS WIDE RANGING IMPLICATIONS ACTUALLY FOR THE VERY SAME PEOPLE. AND THE REASON COVERAGE AGAIN NEED TO GET RIGHT WILLIAM PROVIDE THEM COVERAGE AND DO WE KNOW YOUNG ADULTS ARE MORE LIKELY WITH THAT'S WHEN THEY START DEVELOPING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH NOW SCHIZOPHRENIA OTHER TYPES MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS BUT YET. NOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACTTHE MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT. NOW IT'S GONNA HAVE IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST STDS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS SO. AT THE WE NEED TO BE A LOT MORE CAREFUL ABOUT. ABOUT THIS AND AND WORK OUT SOME THESE OTHER ISSUES BEFORE SOMEONE TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF THE SPOT WHICH AT LEAST AT THIS POINT IS NOT. I'M NOT SURE WHAT I CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT WE HAVE. THE RIGHT RESOURCES THERE YET. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. OKAY AS ITS OWN AND DOES IS ADMITTED IN AND MY CONCERNS OR DID YOU THINK. I KELLY ON NOTED THERE ARE SOME CONSIDERATIONS -- FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND WE ARE I'M LOOKING AT LIKE WE SAID LOOK -- LOOKING AT DATA ON PUBLIC HEALTH VERSUS COUNTY INDIGENT ALSO WE ARE -- YOU KNOW LOOKING AT OUR HEARING THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'RE GETTING ON THIS PROPOSAL. WELL THERE'S NO COMMITMENT TO CHANGE OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET STANDS AS IT IS. WE ARE WE ARE HEARING THE CONCERNS. OKAY WELL I HOPE THAT -- THERE'D BE SOME RECONSIDERATION WE SEE THIS COME BACK IN. AND DAY IN AND AND ACTUALLY -- I REALIZE WHERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND AGAIN BUT AND I DON'T KNOW I SERVE PULLED IN A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES BUT THERE I THINK THERE IS THIS LARGER QUESTION WE'RE NOT PUTTING AND DO IT. DEAL WITH IN THIS BUDGET ENTIRELY BUT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHERE ARE FUNDING STREAMS ARE GOING AND HOW DO THEY LINE UP WITH THE NEEDS THAT ARE THERE AND SO. AND I MEAN IN SOME SENSE IS A MICROCOSM OF THIS BECAUSE I THINK I'M ALSO HEARING IS THAT LEASE FOR SOME COUNTIES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S GONNA BE CLAWED BACK IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE AMOUNT OF BODY. THAT'S ACTUALLY THE THEY'RE READY YEAH SO THAT THAT THERE'S A DISCONNECT THERE BUT AS ONE OF THE MANY DISCONNECTS THROUGHOUT THE SOUL [inaudible] SYSTEMS UP [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY ALL RIGHT IN THE MEANTIME I GUESS WE CAN TALK ABOUT TRYING TO FIND SOME MORE RESOURCES. FOR SEE WORKING IT'S MORE PEOPLE ALL RIGHT. OKAY ALL RIGHT WITH THAT AND ONE THAT. NIGHT INDEED THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH SO WHAT BEFORE EVERYONE GOES WELL WE GO AHEAD TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE ISSUE WELL WE HAVE THE OVERVIEW AND AND THEN WE HAVE ISSUE TO WHICH IS THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. AND THE FOR TWENTY FOUR ABILITY AND THEN THE MEDICAL EXPANSION ALL COME TOGETHER IN A PACKAGE SO. WELCOME. I THANK YOU I'M SORRY WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER -- I JUST WANNA PICK UP ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE DEPEND WAS STARTING TO TALK ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AND THEIR LABOR I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT. WHAT ARE THE COST SAVINGS IF YOU PROVIDE PREVENTIVE CARE TO THIS POPULATION WILL THEY USE THE E. ARE LESS WILL WE SEE LESS CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND WILL WE SAVE HEALTHCARE DOLLARS BUT? I WON ACT A HIGHLY -- THE BROADER ECONOMIC PICTURE THE PRODUCTIVITY -- THESE THESE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS ARE ONE IN TEN WORKERS IN OUR STATE -- AND OFTEN THEY WORK IN AN UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THAT PAYS THEM LESS THAN WHAT CITIZENS WOULD ACCEPT -- AND THE EMPLOYERS ROUTINELY FAILED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE OR OTHER BENEFITS -- AND THEN WE COLLECT TAXES FROM THESE WORKERS WHILE EXCLUDING THEM FROM ALMOST ALL PUBLIC PROGRAMS -- AND EGGS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT IS OUR ORGANIZATION ACTUALLY SPOKE WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WAKE OF THE WILD FIRES. WHO WERE TAKING IT AGAIN COMPOSED SMALL GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TAKING IT UPON THEMSELVES TO GO OUT AND DELIVER MASKS TO AGRICULTURAL WORKERS THAT WERE STILL OUT THERE AND NOXIOUS AIR QUALITY? PICKING BLUE STRAWBERRIES IN VENTURA COUNTY PICKING BLUEBERRIES OUT IN A LOW DIE WE HAVE. MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS -- AND SO I JUST WANT TO REALLY TOUCH ON THE FACT THAT THE SEE THE COST SAVINGS ARE NOT JUST IN HEALTHCARE DOLLARS ARE ALSO IN WORKER PRODUCTIVITY -- AND THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE INTERSECTION OF THE LABOR AND ALSO THE HEALTH CARE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. CHU REMEMBERS ALTAMONT IN SMITH WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK AND WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE AFFORDABILITY MEASURES WE THINK THAT -- THE MANDATE PIECE ALONG WITH THE SUBSIDY THE INCREASED SUBSIDIES WILL GET MORE PEOPLE INSURED AND IT WILL ALSO BE CRITICAL ENSURING THAT CANCER PATIENTS. CAN AFFORD THEIR MEDICATIONS -- AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PAYING JUST. FURTHER PREMIUM SO THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING ALISON VIEWS FROM THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND OF CALIFORNIA SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA COVERAGE IN HEALTH INITIATIVES -- WE CONTINUE TO BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT AFFORDABILITY FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA -- AND WHILE WE SUPPORT GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S FORD ABILITY WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WOULD COMPLETELY BY PASSED THE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND CHILDREN AND SPOUSES IN CALIFORNIA WHO FALL INTO THE FAMILY GLITCH -- WE ALSO DO SUPPORT INVESTMENT -- IN AFFORDABILITY ON ON THE SCALE NEEDED -- AS I THINK YOU KNOW THE FAMILY WHICH OCCURS WHEN ONE PERSON IN THE HOUSEHOLD I HAS AN INDIVIDUAL OFFER OF COVERAGE IT IS AFFORDABLE BUT FOR HIM FAMILY COVERAGE WOULD NOT BE UNAFFORDABLE. IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S CHILDREN WITH INCOMES FROM 210067% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL 24100% AND SPOUSES WITH INCOMES WITH FROM A HUNDRED AND 3924100%. AND THESE CHILDREN AND SPOUSES ARE CURRENTLY COMPLETELY BARRED FROM FEDERAL SUBSIDIES BECAUSE THE DEFINITION OF AFFORDABILITY IS TIED TO INDIVIDUAL AND NOT FAMILY COVERAGE -- THE ADMINISTRATION'S AFFORDABILITY PROPOSAL WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE TO THESE GLITCH AFFECTED CHILDREN AND SPOUSES WHILE EXTENDING SUBSIDIES TO HIGHER INCOME INDIVIDUALS RAISING CLEAR ISSUES OF EQUITY -- WE ARE NOT PROPOSING THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETELY BACK FILL THE MISSING FEDERAL SUBSIDIES BUT RATHER THAT PEOPLE -- WE PROPOSE MAKING WHICH AFFECTED FAMILIES ELIGIBLE FOR STATE ASSISTANCE IN THE SAME AMOUNT AS SIMILARLY SITUATED INDIVIDUALS WHO DO GET FEDERAL SUBSIDIES. AND WE HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS TO ENSURE THAT TODAY AREN'T COMPLETE CAPRICIOUSLY AND EXCLUDED FROM BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE ASSISTANCE -- POSSIBLY WITH A MORE EQUITABLE APPROACH LIKE PREMIUM STOCKING. WE'RE ALSO ALL STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF EXPANDING FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS AND DO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT TO EXPAND IT TO M..

TO AGE TWENTY SIX BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY SUPPORT -- COVERAGE FOR ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU. PRIDE MONTH THANK EVERYONE WHO TESTIFIED I DO HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS THAT RELATE TO THE SOME OF THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY SO FIRST OF ALL WE'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I THINK ANY MENTION THERE'S A BILL THAT TO ACTUALLY EXPAND GO BEYOND AGE TWENTY SIX HAS. FINANCE DONE ANY ANALYSIS AS TO HOW MUCH. THAT WOULD COST SINCE WE'RE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. A LORRY ALLEGE APARTMENT A FINANCE THE MEDI CAL COSTS FOR EXPANDING. THROUGH AGE -- SIXTY FOUR IS A ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION THAT'S JUST FOR MEDI CAL OUR FINANCE COUNTERPARTS FOR DEPARTMENTS OR SERVICES ARE STILL WORKING ON THE ESTIMATE FOR HSS COSTS THAT ONLY UPDATE SIXTY FOUR THAT'S ONLY AND REACH. SIXTY FOUR IS A ONE LOOKED AT AND SIXTY FIVE AND ABOVE IS. NINETY FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND OKAY IN THAT INCLUDE FULL SCOPE INCLUDING NURSING HOME CARE EVERYTHING ARE AT IS NOT INCLUDE I JUST SAYS. OKAY BUT THINGS ARE STILL BEING. DEVELOPED OKAY DOES THAT INCLUDE NURSING HOME CARE. TO YEAH I KNOW YOU TO PAY FOR MANY OF THEM YEAH. SO THAT WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT COSTS. SO THAT WE CAN VERIFY BUT THE COSTS THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS FOR SIXTY FIVE AND ABOVE FOR THE COST THAT WE OTHERWISE DON'T PAY FOR TODAY SO WE DO PAY FOR SKILLED NURSING CARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS -- SO WE CAN GET BACK ON MORE DETAILS BUT THAT'S PROBABLY THE DELTA OF THE DIFFERENCE FOR WHAT'S OTHERWISE NOT COVERED OKAY AND OF COURSE WE SAID WE WERE. DOING TO GET FROM SOCIAL SERVICE THE ITEMS AS CLASS CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. RIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS -- WE HEARD ABOUT THE FAMILY GLITCH. THAT WAS -- IS THERE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT HAD BEEN AN EXAMINATION OF WHETHER SOME OPTIONS TO REALIZE THAT'S AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- TERMS OF THE STATE TRYING TO HELP OUT IN ANYWAY WITH SENT. OUT NOW. OKAY. THE DECLINE PART OF FINANCE AGAIN WE'RE NEARING AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL RIGHT NOW SO THE FAMILY COULD WOULD STILL BE. REFLECTED IN OUR PROPOSAL FOR THE STATE MANDATE AND STATES OF THE PROGRAM. OKAY SO -- SO THERE ISN'T ANY EXAMINATION WHETHER JURORS. SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT DO TO HELP OUT FAMILIES WHO ARE CAUGHT IN THE FAMILY GLITCH ALL RIGHT NOW AGAIN IT IN MIRRORS WHAT'S IN THE FEDERAL LAW [inaudible] OKAY. RIGHT IT MIGHT BE GOOD. TO LOOK AT THAT I MEAN I REALIZE IT'S A AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK SOME OF THAT CAME OUT OF THE NAY THE WAY THE ACA CAME OUT WHICH WAS IS THAT -- WHEN THE ACA WAS GOING THROUGH TO THE THE WORKING VERSION WAS THE HOUSE VERSION UNTIL? THE THE ACTION IN THE SENATE WHICH MEANT THAT THE SENATE VERSION BECAME THE DEFAULT VERSION BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE IT AMENDMENTS TO IT SO WE HAD SOME OF THESE THINGS LIKE. UNFORTUNATELY THE FAMILY WHICH IS A PRETTY BIG. ONE SO ALL RIGHT I JUST WANT TO PUT A LITTLE MARKER ON THAT AS WELL AND OKAY. RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY WELL THANK YOU ALL FOR FOR BEING HERE -- WE'RE NOW GOING TO HEAR -- WE HAVE SEVERAL STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS RELATED TO EXPANSION MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT. SEE WE HAVE THREE CELL WE NEED STILL NEED OUR LA -- AND THE APPROPRIATE FINANCE PEOPLE HERE. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO WE'LL START THE FIRST ONE IS -- WE HAVE -- WHEN THE WIND FROM THE WEATHER CENTER WESTERN CENTER OF LAW POVERTY ENDEAVOR ROTH THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA FOR VISITING PROPOSAL FOR EXPANDING MEDICAID ALL AGES DISABILITY EDGELL ELIGIBILITY OF 210030% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL? SO ASK YOU CAN TRY BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU -- AND THEN WE MAY HAVE OP THESE ARE QUESTIONS FOR EVEN MORE DIALOGUE SO THANK YOU WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ACTUALLY HOLD ON MAYBE BEFORE JUST FOR INTRODUCTIONS SO -- DELEO WHO'S HERE FRIENDLY I'LL. LA A A BEN JOHNSON WITH THE ALIENS. BROWN WAS THE LA ON OKAY FINANCE. LARA AYE ALLEN. WELCOME AND A GUEST OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH COULD BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS LED THE WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE APPRECIATE THE SUBCOMMITTEE CONSIDERING RAISING THE MEDI CAL AGING DISABLED. INCOME LIMIT UP TO A 138% AT THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL UNDER THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ALMOST ALL ADULTS. EXCEPT FOR SENIORS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE OUT OF 210038% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER ARE SUBJECT TO A LOWER INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD OF ABOUT A 123% OR DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. SO IF THE SENIORS END OF IT INCOME IS MORE THAN TWELVE SEVENTY ONE A MONTH. THEY CAN ONLY GET FREE MEDICARE HOW THE CAN ONLY GET MEDI CAL WITH THE SHERIFF COST SHARE COST IS THE AMOUNT AN INDIVIDUAL MUST PAY. FOR FREE MEDI CAL KICKS IN A PERSON'S MEDICAL SARE COST IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT THEY CAN LIVE OFF OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH SO ANYTHING OVER THAT. IS THEIR SHARE OF COST -- FOOD OR THEIR MEDICAL SHERIFF COST MANY SENIORS FOREGO NEEDED MEDICAL X.. A SERVICES PROMPTING THEM TO MOVE INTO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AT A HIGH COST TO THE STATE BUT AN EVEN HIGHER PERSONAL COST TO THEMSELVES. ARE THERE FOR A WEEK WE URGE AT SUBCOMMITTEE -- TO IN THE SENIOR PENALTY AND REYES THE INCOME LIMIT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PANDER BROTH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. WE SUPPORTED THIS PROPOSAL LAST YEAR'S FOR HIGH PRIORITY FOR US THIS YEAR I THINK YOUR ANALYSIS DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF POINTING OUT WHY THIS DISPARITY EXISTS. WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED THE INCOME JUST REGARD WAS MEASURED IN DOLLARS RATHER THAN PERCENTAGES AND SO OVER TIME WE NOW HAVE? A ONE HUNDRED AND 23% -- ELIGIBILITY CUT OFF AND WHAT I THINK IS REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THAT EARLIER WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW EVERYTHING GOES UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN. AND IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU'RE IN OR YOU'REOUT AND IN THIS PROGRAM IF YOU'RE OUT IF YOU FACE THAT HIGH SHERIFF COSTS THAT LINDA WAS TALKING ABOUT. YOU'RE MAKING A CHOICE OR YOU CAN PAY YOUR RENT ARE YOU GOING TO GET HEALTHCARE A LOT OF THE TIME YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SKIP THAT HEALTH CARE PART AND THEN YOU END UP IN THE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR WORSE. PRETEND THAT MY BOOK HERE THE ROOM. INSIDE THIS ROOM IS EVERYONE HAS HEALTH INSURANCE I TELL YOU SPREAD RISK EVERYBODY'S INSIDE THE ROOM MY PEN MY PEN IS THAT PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE THAT. QUALIFICATION TO MEET THAT MEDICAL MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY LEVEL ALL THOSE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE ROOM MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR EVERYONE ELSE WE WANT TO GET EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM IN THE SAME ROOM SPREAD THE RISK AND MAPS FAIR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY COME A COMES FROM AVAIL. NOW FINANCE IN COMMENTS ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL.

ACTUALLY DO YOU HAVE ANY IS RENT ANY PROJECTION AND WHAT THE BUDGETARY IMPACT OF DOING THIS WOULD BE IN TERMS FROM LAST YEAR FINANCE. WE HAVE NOT EVALUATED ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME -- FOR THE CURRENT BUDGET DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OKAY SO -- PREPS RIGHTS AND TO A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE YEAH WE'RE HAPPY TO VALUE A AND DISCUSS THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES AS WE MOVE FORWARD. OKAY. ALL RIGHT DO YOU DON'T HAVE IT THAT. HELLO LAST YEAR THE ESTIMATES -- WAR -- THE THE ANNUAL ESTIMATES WERE ABOUT I THINK A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OUT YEARS NOT US THE FIRST YEAR BUT THE AFTER THE THE RAMP UP -- AND WE WE'VE HAD SOME SOME INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WE THINK THAT'S A LITTLE HIGH BECAUSE OF THE DIGEST AS TAKE UP AS HIGH AS WELL AS THE THE MEDI CAL POPULATION -- MORE BEING -- DULY ELIGIBLE AND THEREFORE CHEAPER SO -- WE'VE HAD SOME INITIAL GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH -- FINANCE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY WELL THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WILL GET TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER WE FINISH ALL THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS I THINK SURAJ OKAY -- NEXT UP WE HAVE -- KRISTIN GOLDEN TESTER FROM THE CAL GRAHAM. OKAY SELF ACTUALLY FORGET ALL INTRODUCE OURSELVES FIRST AND THEN WE CAN BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY I WON'T COUNT THE INTRODUCTION TIME AGAINST YOUR THREE MINUTES. ALL RIGHT. TOTAL THE INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTIONS FIRST OKAY -- CHRIS GOLDEN TEST WITH THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN'S COVERAGE COALITION -- FARLEY THE CALIFORNIA WITH ASSOCIATION OKAY -- CARES ON BEHALF OF THE MARCH OF DIMES OKAY SO BETWEEN THE TH THE HOWEVER MAYES TALKING YEP THREE MINUTES RIGHT GOOD -- SO WE'RE ASKING FOR FUNDING IN THE TO IMPLEMENT A MEDI CAL EXPRESS LANE PATHWAY TO ENROLLMENT HROUGH. THROUGH THE WICKETS THAT THROUGH WORK ON THIS IS ABOUT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND AS YOU KNOW THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND UNINSURED CHILDREN AS YOU HEARD -- HALF OF THEM ARE ELIGIBLE SO REALLY OUR WORK IS TO FIND THEM AND ENROLL THEM -- THE SMART STRATEGY WOULD BE TO GO TO OTHER STATE PROGRAMS WHERE THE SIMILAR ELIGIBILITY RULES AND THOSE FAMILIES ARE WERE LARGE NUMBER OF FAMILIES ARE. AND ENROLL THEM FROM THEIR WHERE WHICH IS A NUTRITIONAL PROGRAM BUT NOT ROLE TO MEDI CAL AND BASED ON ELIGIBILITY THEY ALL SHOULD BE ENROLLED. AN ELIGIBLE FOR MATT AND MEDI CAL SIMILARLY THERE'S THIRTEEN THOUSAND PREGNANT WOMEN AND THIS IS A CONCERNING PROBLEM BECAUSE WE KNOW THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES AND PHONE NUMBERS OF THESE FAMILIES AND YET WE'RE NOT HELPING THEM AND ROLE. SO -- YET THERE'S A GOOD STRATEGY HERE WHERE THERE'S A FEDERAL -- FLEXIBILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO EXPRESS LANE AT THE TERMINOLOGY EXPRESSLANE ELIGIBILITY THEM INTO A MEDIC HELP USING THE WICK -- ELIGIBILITY FINDINGS AND SO OUR PROPOSAL IS TO DO JUST THAT ON TO CREATE A PATHWAY FOR NOT JUST THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE NOW ON WORK BUT GOING FORWARD THAT WHEN THEY'RE SHOWING UP -- FOR WHICH NUTRITIONAL SERVICES THEY'RE ABLE TO ENROLL -- INTO MEDICAL AT THE SAME TIME -- LOGISTICS ON DOLLARS AS I MENTIONED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- IS FIVE MILLION IS WHAT WE'RE IMAGINING IT IS WHAT IT WILL COST IT'S WILL BE MODIFIED THESE ARE -- SYSTEM MODIFICATION DOLLARS AND THEN GOING FORWARD IT'S REALLY JUST THE ENROLLMENT COSTS OF THESE CHILDREN TO THAT -- WE'VE ALREADY PROMISED WE'D WIN ROLE AND AND THIS IS THIS THIS WOULD BE FOR FILLING THE STATE COMMITMENT -- FOR THOSE CHILDREN AND THE GOVERNOR -- ON THE AGENCIES WE KNOW THAT THEY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL -- EASING ACCESS INTO HEALTH CARE FOR THESE WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN WILL HAVE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES WHICH IS A NUTRITION PROGRAM AND JUST THAT ALONE HAS BETTER OUTCOMES. HEALTH OUTCOME SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM SO CERTAINLY IF PEOPLE CAN EASILY GET INTO HEALTH CARE. AND THEN I HAVE THE HEALTH OF BENEFITS WILL HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES IN SOMETHING. OF NOTE ABOUT THE WICK PARTICIPANTS IS THEIR YOUNG THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE YOUNG. AND WHEN THEY DO USINESS THEY EXPECTED TO BE STREAMLINED AND THEY ARE OKAY WITH INCREASED USE OF TECHNOLOGY SO HORIZONTAL INTEGRATION SPEAKS TO THEM. AND THAT'S HOW THEY DO BUSINESS SO. OF MODERNIZING THIS AND EXCUSE ME HAVING DATA ON SHARING AN ELIGIBILITY AND APPLICATION ACCESS. IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD REALLY ENHANCE -- UPTAKE AND HAVE A GOOD OUTCOME FOR THESE KIDS IN OUR FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU ORDERED AS WITH ALL WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS. TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS THE BEST TIME TO HELP A WOMAN SURE CORRECT HEALTHY PREGNANCIES BEFORE SHE'S PREGNANT.

SURE JENNIFER CAN'T DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. DC COOPER POLICY ADVISER HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS AND ERICA'S BURBANK CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OKAY DELEO. BROWN WAS THE LA -- BEN JOHNSON ALEJO A FINANCE WELCOME AND A GUEST FINANCE JACOB I AM FINANCE OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO -- WHEN WE GO AHEAD BEGIN THE OVERVIEW OF DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE DO HAVE A DETAILED WRITE UP SO -- HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS THANK YOU. SO AS THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AS YOU SAID IT'S A SMALL. VERY SELF CONTAINED PROGRAM THAT IS EASILY AND I WILL INVITE PRESENTATION -- SO AS WE HAVE. IN FRONT OF YOU AND REALLY GOOD AGENDA THAT LAYS OUT OF THE SIGNIFICANT -- COSTS AND FACTORS THAT GO INTO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM I LIKE TO START OFF BY EXPLAINING OUR DEPARTMENT AS ESSENTIALLY OVERSEEN SIX DELIVERY SYSTEMS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE SERVE APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS -- WE HAVE ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND THIS YEAR'S BUDGET IS PROJECTING TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUNDS. ABOUT TWENTY THREE BILLION IN STATE GENERAL FUNDS AND THEN THE OTHER REMAINING AMOUNTS ARE A MIXTURE BETWEEN FEDERAL FUNDS AND OTHER TYPES OF FUNDING SOURCES. IN ADDITION TO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM MOST PROBABLY WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM WE ALSO OVERSEE THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES PROGRAM WHICH IS A SMALLER. PROGRAM WHICH IS THE OLDEST PROGRAM -- IN OUR DEPARTMENT STARTED IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN SERVING APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT MEET CERTAIN THRESHOLDS AND TREATMENT LEVELS. WE ALSO FEE FOR SERVICE DENTAL MANAGE CARE WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH -- DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SOME INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS WITH WITH THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR WE HAVE COUNTIES PROVIDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES ON BOTH THE STATE PLAN BASIS AS WE LIKE TO SAY. AND THROUGH OUR ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM MEDICAID WAIVER WE ARE -- LET'S SEE FEE FOR SERVICE MANAGED CARE DENTAL CCS A CD MENTAL HEALTH AND THEN -- THE REMAINING PROGRAMS -- INCLUDE OUR FAMILY PLANNING -- SOME RURAL INDIAN HEALTH CLINIC PROGRAMS AND THEN OBVIOUSLY A AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES. A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT -- TIME AND ATTENTION HAS BEEN SPENT ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND PROVIDING COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY HAD ACCESS TO MEDICAID -- INCLUDE IN THE PROPOSAL THAT WE JUST HEARD -- I WILL ALSO JUST SAY IN TERMS OF AN OVERVIEW -- FROM THE BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE -- THE GOVERNOR -- WITH THE PRESENTATION OF HIS JANUARY REALLY TRIED TO BALANCE -- A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMPETING DEMANDS I WITH THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY OF OF MAKING SURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS APPROPRIATELY RESOURCE SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL MORE BROADLY YOU'LL SEE. I'M OBVIOUSLY EXTENDING COVERAGE TO ANOTHER SET OF POPULATION TO MOVE CALIFORNIA CLOSER CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE -- THERE WAS ALSO RECOGNITIO OF SOME VERY SPECIALIZED POPULATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO SERVE WITH COUNTIES MANAGED CARE PLANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS -- SO THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION IN OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT PROGRAM WHICH IS THROUGH OUR ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER. SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS HOUSING NEEDS FOR THE MENTALLY ILL AND OTHER HIGH COST POPULATIONS IN OUR COUNTIES WITH A WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT -- THERE WILL BE AND I'M SURE -- FUTURE DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE USE OF PROPOSITION -- FIFTY SIX WE HAVE A VARIETY OF PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS I'M USING THOSE ADDITIONAL -- TOBACCO TAX DOLLARS THERE ARE -- ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN EARLY PSYCHOSIS TREATMENT AND IDENTIFICATION AND SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT EITHER ARE AT RISK OF OR HAVE HAD THEIR FIRST PSYCHOTIC BREAK. WORKING WITH THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES TO PROVIDE AND LINKAGE TO SERVICES AND I THINK WHEN YOU TAKE ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS IN TOTO -- ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENT IN ACROSS THE PROGRAM SO SEE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY A BOTH THE INTEREST AND DEDICATION TO MEETING -- COMPLEX PATIENTS WITH AND TRYING TO FILL IN COVERAGE GAPS AND SHORTAGES IN AREAS IN WHICH WE NOTE THAT THEY CERTAINLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN A PRIORITY ORDER. WHILE MAINTAINING A FISCAL -- BALANCE WITH THE REST OF THE STATE -- COMPETING TO PAY DEMANDS ACROSS NOT ONLY OUR AGENCY BUT ACROSS THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND HOLE SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM HELLO. HEY FINANCE NO ALL RIGHT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY I JUST SAID A FEW QUESTIONS -- IN TERMS OF JUST SOME OF THE FUNDING -- THINGS SO UP TO LOOK AT ONES WITH THE LARGER VARIANCES SIGN I KNOW THAT -- IN THE NEXT ITEM WILL ADDRESS THE CHANGES IN THE QUALITY ASSURANCE -- REVENUE FUND FOR HOSPITALS AND ALSO THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL INVESTMENT -- ACTUALLY THE LONG TERM CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE FUND -- BUT SO X. NOTED I'D MAKE NOTE IN THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE FOR THE PROPOSED WE ARE ESTIMATING A ACTUALLY IS SO IT'S LIKE US. SIGNIFICANT INCREASE ALTHOUGH THE SKILL OF MEDI CAL PERHAPS -- BUT I NOTICED THAT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REVISED GOES FROM SAYS ESSENTIALLY ROUTE SEVENTY THREE MILLION TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND THEN ON THE PHYSICIAN SERVICES ACCOUNT FOR TWENTY TWO MILLION TWENTY TWO AND A HALF MILLION TO ABOUT. THIRTY NINE MILLION AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT WAS DRIVING THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF ON OF MAY FINANCE KNOWS OR WELL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THAT INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX BACK FILL THAT POP NINETY NINE IS RECEIVING. AND SO BECAUSE PROP FIFTY SIX IS HAVING AN EFFECT OF THE AFFECT. TO DECREASE TOBACCO CONSUMPTION ACROSS THE STATE. PROPERTY SIX IS STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO BACK FILL ANY LOSSES IN REVENUE TO PROP NINETY NINE SO THAT YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE IS THAT BACK FILL AMOUNT OKAY COMING IN. OKAY BUT THAT AND SO THAT'S THAT THAT LARGE YEAH LOOKS FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE FIRST. SEVENTY TWO WAS THE FIRST BACK FULL YEAR BUT THAT WAS ONLY ON A QUARTER WORTH OF REVENUE IN OKAY MOVING FORWARD AT THE FULL YEAR YES OKAY SO NOW THIS IS REFLECTING A FULL YEAR BACK SO OKAY. THANK YOU AND THEN ACTUALLY ANOTHER QUESTION IS -- THE DESIGNATED HOT PUBLIC HOSPITAL GME. THE FUNNY NO THERE IT DOES THAT WAIVER OR SOUNDS LIKE GOES. PLOT PROMISE AROUND THAT -- WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- LAST YEAR FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION AND WE THEN BUT ON THE REVISED ITS DOWN THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION AND NOW -- FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOES THAT MEAN THE WAIVER DIDN'T AND JUST WONDERING WHAT WHAT THERE'S WHAT THAT REFLECTS. THE CITY OF PUBLIC HOSPITAL JIMMY SPECIALLY SPECIAL FUNDS YEAH BUT WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA -- UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- THE THE AMOUNT OF ESSENTIALLY -- ROOM TO FUND GM ME. AT THESE HOSPITALS WAS -- SCRUTINIZED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ULTIMATELY WAS REVISED DOWNWARD SO THE ROOM IS YOU KNOW A SORT OF A REASONABLE PAYMENT LIMIT. PERHAPS TO TIED. TO MEDICARE -- AND OUT OF FOLLOWING ANALYSIS FROM THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- ONE DAY -- WE REALIZED WE DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH ROOM TO INCREASE FUNDING THROUGH GME AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT SO THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF OF AT LEAST. WHAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO SOME OF THAT REDUCTION. AND WE CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE OKAY NO MORE YEAH I DID STEP BECAUSE I KNOW THIS WAS A SUBJECT OF SOME PREVIOUS BUDGET HEARINGS I THINK PEOPLE ARE EXCITED THAT WE WERE TALKING LIKE EVEN OVER A BILLION DOLLARS AND A GOOD BUT YOU KNOW THINGS ARE WAITING FOR THINGS SO. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR MILLION TO SORT OF REPRESENT THE STEADY STATE AGREEMENT OR WHATEVER OR IS IT GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET OUTSIDE JUST WANTING WHAT STATUS WAS ON THE ON THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL GMT. I I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS FINALIZED AT THE TIME OF THE BUDGET THAT -- THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THE APPROVAL BUT WE CAN DOUBLE CHECK ALL RIGHT BEING A STATUS UPDATE ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL JIMMY APPRECIATED OKAY. RIGHT OKAY WITH THAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THEN -- ACTUALLY WELL US ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE OVERVIEW. I SEE NO AT THE MICROPHONE LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE MEDI CAL TWENTY EIGHT NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN MEDI CAL ESTIMATE OVERVIEW. GOOD AFTERNOON. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF THE REFLECTS THE TOTAL BUDGET FOR DH CS OF A HUNDRED FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AS MENTIONED BY A DIRECTOR CAN'T -- ADDITIONALLY DH CS HAS AROUND THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND IN THE JANUARY BUDGET PROCESS -- REQUEST AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN NEW POSITIONS WHICH INCLUDES EIGHT THAT ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED TERM -- BURKE CONVERTING TO PERMANENT IT'S THE LARGEST PART OF THE DH CS -- BUDGET -- IN IS IS REPRESENTATIVE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED BILLION OF THE HUNDRED AND FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN THERE. THE NOVEMBER ESTIMATE DID PROJECT REDUCTION NEED FROM GENERAL FUND FOR CURRENT YEAR OF ABOUT TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS -- AND THAT WAS COMPRISED OF A VARIETY OF THINGS OF WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION DUE TO SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION OF IN LOWER. THAN ANTICIPATED FEDERAL DEFERRALS. ADDITIONALLY THREE HUNDRED AND SORRY SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE LONG TERM CARE AND HOSPITAL QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE. OFFSETS DUE TO DELAYS FROM TRANSFERS FROM THE WITH HOLD FUND OR THE QUALITY ASSURANCE FUND TO THE GENERAL FUND. THREE HUNDRED NINETY MILLION OF HIGHER DRUG REBATES IN TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF LOWER MANAGED CARE COST PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE LOWER CASE LOAD. GIVEN THE ONE TIME NATURE OF NEARLY ALL OF THESE -- YOU DO SEE A NEARLY EQUIVALENT TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN -- BUDGET YEAR AND DIRECTOR CAN'T ARE YOU WALK THROUGH A LARGE NUMBER OF THE THINGS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT TWO POINT TWO BILLION SO I WON'T REPEAT THOSE AND I WOULD IMAGINE THIS WOULD BE DISCUSSED IN THIS HEARING OR OTHER HEARINGS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU COMPASS MILIEU. THANK MISTER CHAIR RYAN WILL THE WITH THE LA -- AND WE HAVE -- TAKEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME REVIEW THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATE -- WE HAVE VARIOUS COMMENTS TO PROPOSALS BUT FROM THE OVER ARCHING PERSPECTIVE. AND JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IN TERMS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S CASELOAD ESTIMATES -- DOES APPEAR ROUGHLY IN THE REASON RANGE BUT THAT MAY BE A LITTLE CAUTIOUS IN PARTICULAR THE DECLINE. IN THE FAMILIES AND CHILDREN CASELOADS THAT WE HAVE SEEN DUE TO THE CONDITIONS IN THE ECONOMY AND POTENTIALLY OTHER POLICY -- WINDS THAT ARE GOING ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S AN EXPECTATION OF THOSE WERE FLATTENED CONSIDERABLY IN IN THE COMING YEAR SO WE HIGHLIGHT THAT IS SOMETHING TO CONTINUE TO WATCH WILL -- COME BACK WITH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THE TME OF THE ME REVISION BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT -- CASES COULD WIND UP BEING SOME A LOWER THAN THAN EXPECTED IN IN THE JANUARY BUDGET [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] THANK FINANCE. ONCE RIGHT QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT -- SO ACTUALLY THE I HAVE TO ASK ABOUT PROP FIFTY FIVE PRESS FINANCE CAN ADDRESS THAT SO WE HAVE A CON IN ME IS ROARING -- THE COURTING TO PROP FIFTY FIVE HOUR MEETING READ I MEAN. THIS THIS ISN'T THE FIFTH THIS YEAR WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT FALLS INTO MEDI CAL OUT PROP FIFTY FIVE I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU CALCULATE THE FORMULA SO I KNOW IT'S IN YOUR HANDS FINANCE CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHY WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY PROP FIFTY FIVE REVENUE GOING. TO MEDI CAL AS THE VOTERS INTENDED. JUGGLING THE PART OF FINANCE YOU ARE CORRECT THERE IS NO PROPERTY FIVE SPECIFIC REVENUES GOING TO THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. I WOULD DEFER TO OUR COLLEAGUES IN OUR ARE FORECASTING AND WHO COULD PROBABLY BETTER ADDRESS THAT QUESTION FOR YOU BUT WE CAN WORK TO GET AN ANSWER FOR YOU AND YOUR STAFF. YES LA -- PLEASE. AS YOU MENTIONED THE THE FORMULA IS IN THE HANDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT'S IT'S SAID THAT CALCULATION IS SOME OF THE DISCRETION OF THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE HOWEVER -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE APPROACH USED IN THIS YEAR'S CALCULATION. IS VERY SIMILAR IF NOT IDENTICAL TO THE APPROACH USE LAST YEAR -- IN OUR OFFICE DID RELEASE ARE WALK THROUGH THA -- CALCULATION AND OUTLINED MANY PLACES WHERE THERE COULD BE VARYING INTERPRETATIONS OF HOW. THE CALCULATION IS DONE AND ONE IN PARTIULAR. RELATES TO THE WORKLOAD BUDGET WHICH WOULD SERVE TO INCREASE OR REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT CALCULATION WOULD HAVE LEFT OVER FOR MEDI CAL. AND LAST YEAR WE DESCRIBED HOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH -- IS FAIRLY BROAD AND CONSIDERS MANY SERVICES -- PART OF THE WORKLOAD BUDGET THAT OTHER APPROACHES -- MIGHT NOT AND SO IT IT APPEARS THAT THIS -- CONTINUATION OF A OF A BROAD INTERPRETATION OF THE WORKLOAD BUDGET HAS CONTRIBUTED -- TO AGAIN THIS YEAR -- THERE NOT BEING ANY FUNDING FOR MEDI CAL COMING OUT OF THE CALCULATION. SO I GET A AC A DISEASE FOLLOW UP. AND I'M TO RECALL THE THEIR DISCUSSIONS LAST YEAR -- AND IS YOU POINTED OUT THIS VERY BROAD -- FROM DALY IS PERSPECTIVE ASISTIR I GUESS. IT'S THAT THAT IS IN THE HANDS OF FINANCE BUT IT ACCORDING TO NISHA BUT I MEAN. I GUESS THE QUESTION MIGHT BE AND YOU CAN TELL ME YOU DON'T IS LIKE WELL HOW ABOUT APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH OR WHAT SKILL OF MONEY WE SHOULD WE BE EXPECTING FROM PROP FIFTY FIVE I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE THING IS. IS WE'RE NOT A DOWN ECONOMY RIGHT NOW WE'RE A REVENUES ARE GOOD AND SO FORTH AND JUST DECIDED SHE TO ME THAT. NOTHING THERE'S THAT THAT'S IT THAT EVEN IN A YEAR LIKE THE PAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE WE HAVE NOTHING THAT SHOWS UP. AND AND AND JUST CONCERNED THAT THE VOTERS. LOOK AT THIS AND THEY GO WELL WE VOTED FOR THIS. AND Và PLAYING GAMES. PLAYING GAMES TO BE SURE THAT MONEY ISN'T GOING TO WHERE WE INTENDED. NOW. ANY IN ANY ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THE TERMS OF WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD THAT SHOULD BE EXPECTING IN FIFTY FIVE I REALIZED THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS A CALCULATED BUT YEAH EXCTLY THE WAY I DON'T HAVE A HE LIKE ALTERNATE. COMPLEXITY IS TO THE CALCULATION AND I THINK IN A REPORT LAST YEAR WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT IT'S UNCERTAIN HOW EXACTLY IT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED -- BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT WITH THE THE CURRENT -- INTERPRETATION OF THE WORKLOAD BUDGET AND THE SAME INTERPRETATION INTERPRETATION THAT WAS USED IN THE ENACTED BUDGET LAST YEAR -- IT'S IT'S RELATIVELY UNLIKELY THAT THAT THERE WOULD BE FUNDS APPROPRIATED IN THE FUTURE. AS THE NEW PROPOSALS THAT ARE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET SO SORT OF EAT INTO THE REVENUES. AND ACTUALLY AND I KNOW IF MODEL THE SO HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD WE HAVE TO BRING IN AN ORDER FOR SAID ANYTHING THE FALLEN FIFTY FIVE WOULD BE THE THRESHOLD. GIVEN THIS KIND OF INTERPRETATION. I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER WITH ME TODAY BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT AND RIGHT BACK TO YOU. SO OKAY WELL I EIGHT YOU KNOW MY MY CONCERN IS IS THAT EVERY TIME WE GO TO THE VOTERS AND WE ASK. VOTERS. TO PONY UP SOME MORE MONEY. RIGHT AND WE TOLD THE VOTERS THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO GO FOR AND IT DOESN'T GO THERE. OTHER THAN THAT THAT UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE IN -- IF YOU AS A IN IN CONFIDENCE IN ALL OF US HERE. AND SO -- AND AS A THINK. I THINK MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE KIND OF INCREDULOUS TO THINK THAT IN THIS ECONOMY. THAT NONE OF IT ACTUALLY MAKES ITS WAY. TO BACK I MEAN IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A DOWN YEAR AND ARE THERE IT'S NOT SO GOOD NO I'M RECESSION OR OR THAT BRINK OF RECESSION WHATEVER NOW IN TERMS OF BUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S CONCERNING HIS EYES THAT THEY THINK THAT -- YEAH I MEAN WE PUT IN THE HANDS OF FINANCE BECAUSE WE HOPE THAT YOU KNOW EXPECT THAT THAT THAT'S THAT THREE THINGS GOING TO BE DONE I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THE VOTERS THAT I MEAN IT'S MOTORS VOTED FOR IT AT NIGHT IT'S THAT THAT WAS DRAFTED. BUT WHEN NOTHING SHOWS UP I MEAN IT. CALLING WELL WHAT'S GOING WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON THERE. EIGHT AND EIGHT AND JUST THE I'VE WILL MY CONTINUE EXPRESSED MY CONCERN THAT -- OTHER MANY PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE AND AND YEAH I THINK THE VOTERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE IT OUT TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY AGREE WITH THE PRIORITY IN OUT AND OFTEN TIMES THEY DO YOU KNOW THE WEEK DAYS -- SUPPORTED A SORT OF RIGHT EVEN BUT IF. BUT NOW WE HEARD THIS WITH OTHERS SB ONE AND HER. OTHER PRIOR ONES THAT IF THEY FEEL LIKE THE MY SIX THIRTY FEEL LIKE THE MONEY DOESN'T GO TO WHERE THEY WANTED TO THAT WE'RE GONNA FIND A WAY TO SCARF THAT MONEY MOVE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU KNOW PLAY SOME DO SOME TECHNICAL LEGAL THING SO I MEAN THERE'S THE LEGAL PART. RIGHT AND I THINK WE TALKED AS LAST TIME AND WE CAN. WE GO TO COURT YOU WIN BECAUSE NOW WE SHOULD FINANCE BUT AT THE TIME OF THE MURDERS QUE CONCERNS ARE TRUST IN THE LEADERSHIP AND INTENT. AND THAT'S WHY I'M CONCERNED IS BEING A ROAD AND THAT ALSO MEANS ARE LESS LIKELY TO FEEL THAT THE THE WANT TO SUPPORT -- OTHER THINGS AS WELL IT'S NOT THAT THEY'LL SUPPORT FIND FUNNY THOSE THINGS IS THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT SURE YOU CAN TRUST US. AND THAT'S THAT'S MY BIG CONCERN. SO I I I I REALLY I REALLY HOPE WE THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT ABOUT THAT -- SO [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. OKAY ANY OTHER CULTURE. A WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SELL ALL RIGHT THE CELL. ALL RIGHT SO -- OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAN AMOUNT. SO [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. AND WE'RE GONNA DALY DELVE INTO A LOT OF THESE THINGS IN MUCH MORE DETAIL IN PARTICULAR ITEMS -- AND BOTH LIKE FOR EXAMPLE PROPERTY SIX IS GOING TO SHOW UP IN THE FUTURE HEARING AND SO FORTH SO THIS IS KIND OF THE BROADER OVERVIEW BUT SINCE I MEAN. PROP FIFTY FIVE IS ABOUT MONEY FOR MEDI CAL THIS IS. ONE THAT IN OKAY -- IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THIS ITEM [inaudible] WHEN MICROPHONE [inaudible] NO [inaudible] OKAY.

CONTINUE TALKING AS NEEDED TO DO INDIVIDUAL PROMISE ITEMS FOR ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE LIKE THE THE ITEM I MENTIONED EARLIER I FOR THE AND DOC EXPANSION. THAT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD APPROACH FOR NOW GIVEN THAT IT'S PRETTY TRICKY TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO RESTART A METHODOLOGY FROM SCRATCH AT THIS POINT AND WORK -- PROBABLY NOT REALLY EVER GOING TO BE AND A STEADY STATE WITH THIS PROGRAM GIVEN UNCERTAINTIES THAT THAT YOU KNOW FEDERAL LEVEL AB CA EXPANSIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

ACCESS TO THE SERVICES PREVENT DETERIORATION OF HEALTH AND THE NEED TO UTILIZE OTHER -- MARGINS HE SERVICES -- THE CHAIR AND I CAN -- ALSO APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR EYEGLASSES WHICH WE HAD EXPECTED TO BE RESTORED IN -- TWENTY TWENTY BASED ON PREVIOUS.

OKAY SO YEAH NO I THINK THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION CERTAINLY ONE BE SURE PEOPLEOF ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE OF EVIDENCE BASED SERVICES -- AND THAT THAT WOULD BE IF TO BENEFIT TO OUR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES AND SEVEN MENTIONED OPTICAL AND DIED IN THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THE DIET TREE CERTAINLY SPEECH THERAPY IS A PEDIATRICIAN. FOR THAT IS. IDEOLOGY SO -- HOPEFULLY WE CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THAT ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NEXT WE HAVE DOCTOR JOHN CHISHOLM FOR THE PRESENT THE CALIFORNIA HI YET MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. WELCOME BACK IT UP PAN THE MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON. YEAH MY NAME IS DOCTOR JOHN CHISHOLM I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA POLICE AFTER MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND ITS MEMBERS. CURRENTLY SERVING AS THAT ASSOCIATIONS PRESIDENT THIS YEAR. INTERESTING BUT IN PRIVATE PRACTICE IN CHULA VISTA CALIFORNIA FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS SERVING ONE OF THE MOST AT THE ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AND UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER THIS POPULATION RELIES HEAVILY ON THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM FOR ITS HEALTH CARE NEEDS. FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS SUFFERED FROM A LACK OF NICKEL CARE THIRTY REASONS FOR THIS FIRST SERVICES BY PODIATRISTS HAS NOT YET BEEN REINSTATED IN ALL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SYSTEMS. AND SECOND PODIATRIC SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO ONEROUS AND UNNECESSARY AUTHORIZATION BILLING AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS THAT FURTHER ACT LIMIT ACCESS TO FOOT AND ANKLE CARE. AS YOU HEARD IN TWO THOUSAND I PROVIDE FREE SERVICES WERE ELIMINATING THE STATE'S MEDICAL STATES MEDICAL PROGRAM. THIS ELIMINATION REMOVE MEDICAID COVERAGE FOR FOOT AND ANKLE MEDICINE AND SURGERY BY A CERTAIN TYPE OF PROVIDER BUT I INTEREST BUT NOT THE SERVICES THEMSELVES THE EXACT SAME PUT NICKEL SERVICES IF PROVIDED BY A POSITION. ARE COVERED IN MEDI CAL BUT PODIATRIST THE SPECIALISTS IN FOOT AND ANKLE CARE ARE PREVENTED FROM RIGHTING THE SAME SERVICES TO MEDI CAL PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT FULL RESTORATION WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF ACCESS TO PODIATRY CARE CURRENTLY SERVICES BY PODIATRISTS ARE SUBJECT TO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF AUTHORIZATION BILLING AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS THAN POSITIONS. I PROVIDED A HANDOUT THAT DOCUMENTS SOME OF THOSE -- DIFFERENCES YOU CAN SEE HOW SIMPLE IT IS FOR A POSITION OF PRIDE PROVIDE PUT NICKEL SERVICES AND HOW DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING IT IS FR A PODIATRIST. ASA MEDICAL MEDI CAL PROVIDER FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER I CAN ATTEST TO THE DIFFICULTY INVOLVED IN TRYING TO MEET ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS. LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS IMPACTS OUR LOW INCOME IN DISABLED PATIENTS. THERE'S AN EPIDEMIC OF DIABETES AND DIABETES RELATED FOOT NICKEL DISEASE IN CALIFORNIA MY OWN COMMUNITY IS BEING DEVASTATED BY THIS EPIDEMIC. DIABETIC FOOT ALTERATIONS IN AMPUTATIONS HAVE BEEN STEADILY INCREASING SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN ONE YEAR AFTER BUT I FREE SERVICES WERE ELIMINATED. THE PREVENTATIVE PUT CARE THAT COULD HAVE PREVENTED THESE ALTERATIONS IS NOT A COVERED BENEFIT AND EVEN IF. PRIDE TREE IS FULLY REASSESSED RESTORED THIS IS FOR MONTHS. IF THE PATIENT FOR EXAMPLE HAPPEN TO HAVE AN ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENT ONE MONTH AND THEN DEVELOPED A DIABETIC FOOT WOUND HE WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO SEE A PODIATRIST ONE TIME THAT MONTH. IN ONLY TWO TIMES IN THE SUBSEQUENT MONTHS I TREAT DIABETIC FOOT AND ANKLE ABOUT DIABETIC FOOT WOUNDS ALL DAY EVERY DAY IT TAKES MANY ORE THAN JUST TWO TREATMENTS TO HEAL THOSE WOUNDS ON A MONTHLY BASIS. WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT TREATING A DIABETIC FOOT WOUND AS AN EMERGENCY LIFE THREATENING CONDITION. THE MEDI CAL PROVIDER MANUAL AGREES IN THIS PROCEDURE DOES NOT REQUIRE PROPER IS-AUTHORIZATION FOR A PHYSICIAN. THE EXACT SAME PROCEDURE. IS A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IS REQUIRED FOR ANY PROCEDURE OR TREATMENT THAT A PODIATRIST PERFORMS INCLUDING LIMóN LIFE THREATENING THREATENING FOOT WOUNDS AND INFECTIONS. THE PATIENT THAT APPEARS AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH A PREVENTABLE LIMB THREATENING ULCERATION INFECTION. BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE OF UNNECESSARY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORIZATION AND BILLING THERE'S USUALLY NO PODIATRIST WILLING TO TAKE THIS PATIENT ON AND EVEN IF ONE DOES HE HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO MEET ALL THE AUTHORIZATION OF BILLING REQUIREMENTS TO BE. REIMBURSED FOR HIS SERVICES INCLUDING ANOTHER PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR TREATMENT RENDERED IN THE HOSPITAL WHICH A POSITION IS NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH OF ANY COMMENTS FROM THE DC OKAY BELIAU [inaudible] FINANCE. QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO WHY NOT ALL RIGHT CENTER. SEVEN WHY NOT RESTORE PODIATRIC -- SERVICES SPECIALLY WITH -- THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF THE DIABETIC POPULATION AND MANY -- SENIORS AT CAN'T EVEN COOK THEIR OWN TOENAILS -- WHY WHY ALL THE EXCESS OF PEOPLE WORK TO GET THE SERVICES THEY SPECIALIZE IN VERSUS A POSITION THAT DOESN'T NEED TO DO THE SAME PAPERWORK? TO TREAT MORE PEOPLE IT'S ALL ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY. ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT THE PROCESS RECLAIMING OUR DEFERRED TO THE MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IT WASN'T. THAT I RESTORATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES IN RESTORING I THINK IT'S FOR RHETORICAL QUESTION THAT I THINK THE SERVICES OF A PROVIDER VERY IMPORTANT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OF CERTAINLY -- DIABETICS -- PEOPLE THAT HAVE OTHER -- PARTY AFTER DISEASES IT WAS A BENEFIT FOR MANY MANY YEARS UNTIL WE HAVE THE ECONOMIC. CRISIS AND I WOULD JUST URGE THE GOVERNOR TO RECONSIDER INCLUDING THEIR SERVICES AND NETWORK -- THE PARALLEL SOME OF VERSUS SERVICES THE PHYSICIANS CANOE BUT WE KNOW WE HAVE A PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA AND IT'S ALL ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY AND IF YOU DON'T GET TO THESE PEOPLE WITH -- WITH ULCERS EARLY -- THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR AMPUTATIONS AND IN THE COUNTRY IS BECAUSE OF DIABETES. A NUMBER BECAUSE OF BLINDNESS IS DIABETES AND HERE WE DON'T HAVE OPTOMETRIC SERVICES BEYOND THAT BUT IT SERVICES AND WE HAVE A GROWING EPIDEMIC OF OF CHILDHOOD DIABETES. THE NEEDS -- NEEDS TO BE TENDED TO SO -- I WOULD STRONGLY URGE THE GOVERNOR RECONSIDER -- ADDING THESE SERVICES AND I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A BIG BUDGET HAD TO TO RESTORE THEM -- TO THOSE LEVELS SO. THANK YOU MISTER. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WE DO. HAVE A THREE MINUTE LIMIT CELL THAT WAS A SIGNAL -- BUT IT'S JUST THAT NOW JUST TO CLARIFY -- IN TERMS OF IF YOU MAY NOTING THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS -- IS -- SO YOU OF THE DIGEST AS A WORKING IN EMERGENCY ROOM RIGHT AND ARE PART OF THE MEDICAL STAFF THEY STILL HAVE THE SO IS THIS FOR THE DIET SO WHAT HAPPENS IN TERMS OF RELATION BETWEEN PODIATRISTS ANY WE HAVE DIFFERENT. ARRANGEMENTS PEOPLE ARE ARE IN -- THAT'S A OF THE MEDICAL STAFF AND THE E. R.. I SIMPLY OF IT THAN THAT THIRTY AFTER PRACTICE YOU MAY BE PART OF A MEDICAL GROUP. IS AT THAT AFFECT THIS IN ANY WAY OR WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WITH IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE HE SAID THE SERVICES ARE COVERED BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN OR FOR BUT DIETERS TO DO IT THEY HAVE TO MEET. THESE ADDITIONAL AT OWN RISK SYSTEMS -- DIABETIC WHEN SALVAGE AND OTHER KINDS OF FOOD MEDICAL CARE ARE PRIMARILY PRIMARILY PROVIDED FOR BY PODIATRISTS SO THAT SENT THROUGHOUT THE KAISER SYSTEM ALL OF THEM GREAT BIG MANAGED CARE SYSTEMS BUT I THAT'S PRIDE FOR ISRAEL. WE RENTED A PROBLEMS IS IN THE IN -- PRIVATE SETTINGS -- ESPECIALLY IN HOSPITALS THAT REQUIRE THAT IS A POLICY OF BEING ON THE EMERGENCY ROOM STAFF FOR BEING ON THE HOSPITAL STAFF YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN WITH YOU TAKE MEDICARE AWAY THEY DON'T TAKE MEDICAL. AND SO AGAIN THE THE SERVICES SIDE AND BESIDES THAT EVEN IF THERE WASN'T MOST PRIDE FIRST WOULD WITH MOST BY TRISTAN I KNOW INCLUDING MYSELF -- REGULARLY TAKE THESE PATIENT ON JUST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO WE TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS AND THAT'S WHEN THIS ONEROUS UNNECESSARY LAUNDRY LIST OF REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE TO FACE. TYPICALLY MYSELF AND OTHER -- AND OTHER -- PROVIDERS WE DO THE CASE PRO BONO THEY DON'T SUBMIT A BILLING THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN TAKE CARE OF THEIR PATIENTS WHICH THEY DO BEST. SO THE THE BEST WAY THAT I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS THAT -- THAT THE SERVICES ARE ARE YOU KNOW. IT IS IN SOME SITUATIONS WHERE PRICES ARE NO LONGER WILLING TO WORK UNDER THAT SITUATION THE WORK IS BEING DONE BY OTHER SPECIALISTS VASCULAR SURGEONS GENERAL SURGEONS. ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS. UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE JUST NOT IT. IN THIS DAY AND AGE THOSE KIND OF SERVICES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS DONE IN MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS WITHOUT I INTEREST YOU IN THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK. AND WHEN THOSE PRICES ARE THERE IT. THE WORK IS BEING DONE BY SPECIALISTS WHO DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR SKILL IN THAT INTERVENTION SO THIS IS JUST A CLARIFY THOUGH WHEN YOU HAVE A GROUP FOR OUR TEAM RIGHT WITH A PODIATRIST SUSIE RIGHTLY SAID DOES. SO -- THIS SO WHEN IT COMES. TO THESE REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLIES TO ALL PODIATRISTS NO MATTER WHAT THE ARRANGEMENT DURIN. FOR FOR INSTANCE SOMEBODY WORKING IN A LARGE MULTI SPECIALTY GROUP YES I DO THAT RIGHT. YEAH LIKE THAT YEAH SO THIS WAS A PART OF A LARGER THEIR PART OF THE MEDICAL GROUPS WITH THE PODIATRIST AS PART MEDICAL GROUP. IS THIS STILL THIS. I PARK I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE GROUPS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEDICAL PAYMENT SYSTEM IS OKAY BUT I DO BUT BUT I DO KNOW THAT AS EMPLOYEES OF THAT SYSTEM TYPICALLY. I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT -- THAT KIND OF ACCESS TO A PODIATRIST WITHIN THOSE SYSTEMS IS LIMITED IN ANY WAY. AFFECT THOSE TEND TO BE THE SUBSTANTIVE WORK PODIA TRICK MEDI MOST -- THEY CAN MOST EASILY RENDER THAT KIND OF SERVICE TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES OKAY BUT DEAR TO PERSON ON CALL FOR THE E. R. AND SOMEONE COMES IN AND YOU GET CALLED AND IT'S MEDI CAL PATIENTS THEN YOU'RE LIKE. OH RIGHT IS THAT THE WELL I I MEAN I'M NOT I'VE BEEN THE CHAIRMAN OF MY STUFF MY ASSOCIATIONS MEDICAL COMMITTEE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I TREAT MEDI CAL PATIENTS HI BILL FROM THEM I GET THE DENIALS AND I KEEP A BIG STACK MOM BECAUSE I NEED THOSE IN ORDER.

DECREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL NEED INTERVENTIONS LIKE GOING TO THE MERCHANTS ROOM OTHER TYPES INTERVENTIONS DO YOU HAVE SOME DATA THAT YOU COULD SHARE WITH US OR DO YOU HAVE SYNDICATE SURE WITH LA -- THAT -- SHOWS THAT ACTUALLY THIS INVESTMENT ME IF YOU HAVE TO SEND IN ANY NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A RETURN ON INVESTMENT -- WHERE -- YOU YOU DO REDUCE HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION COSTS BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF AMHERST PART VISITS HOSPITALIZATIONS AND THROUGH THE COMBINATION OF ENVIRONMENT TRIGGER REDUCTIONS AND THE PATIENT PATIENT ALL RIGHT. SO THE REASON I ASKED THAT QUESTION THEN OF RAISED IT MANY TIMES OF FORWARD HERE AND SOLEMN LOOKING ELIO BUT I ALSO WE CAN pFINANCE. YOU WORK FOR US AS WE LOOK AT YOU FIRST -- BECAUSE I THINK IN WE SCORE PROPOSALS LIKE THIS ALL RIGHT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY OKAY WELL WE YOU KNOW WE GET THE TAKE SOME MONEY BECAUSE WE GOT A A PEOPLE ACRE. THREE HEALTH WORKERS AND SO FORTH -- BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA REDUCE UTILIZATION I REALIZE WE DO LIKE CAPITATION THEN WELL IT'S ALL VERY IN CAPITATION BUT I MEAN REALLY I MEAN THAT THE COMES DOWN. TO YOU KNOW EVEN JUST FINANCIALLY SO I THINK OBVIOUSLY ONE THE MOTIVATIONS ALWAYS A IS OF COURSE WHICH I RDUCE HUMAN SUFFERING RIGHT CELL AND GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR THAT HOW MUCH YOU PAY FOR IS BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT. THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE BILL -- BUT OR HOW MUCH WHO PAYS THE FIELDS TEACHERS WHO GETS ADORNS MEDI CAL -- BUT WILL -- I'D LIKE TO SEE IS -- BUT YEAH I I ALWAYS SAY WE HOLD TO A PRETTY HIGH STANDARD OF WEEKENDS I MEAN THE REAL QUESTION IS IS THIS WELL THIS ACTUALLY. I MEAN. SHOULD THIS BE EVEN SCORES ACOSTA BEYOND THE IMPLEMENTATION.

WE SERVE HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO IN THE CURRENT POPULATION THAT YOU HAVEN'T REACHED. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH EXPOSURE TO IS HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH WE ACTUALLY DECREASE EXPOSURE WITHIN A THERE ARE? EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO DID PROGRAM LIKE THIS ARE. CURRENT PROGRAM THAT'S BEING FUNDED OTHER WAYS WE CAN GET DATA LIKE THAT -- THEN I THINK THAT'S THE WAY WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS SO -- ANY ANY COVER FROM LA ABOUT THAT. I MEAN WE WOULD WE WOULD WELCOME RECEIPT OF THAT RESEARCH AND HAPPY TO REVIEW IT -- WE WE CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE -- THAT VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS CAN PRODUCE SAVINGS IN ADDITION TO COSTS AND SO -- WE WOULD -- WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW SORT OF A A ROBUST RESEARCH AND AND TO BE ABLE -- TO TRY TO INTERPRET THAT WITHIN A WITH ENOUGH FINANCIAL CONTACTS ONE CHALLENGE DOES ARISE IN THAT A LOT OF TIMES THE SAVINGS MIGHT BE YEARS OUT AND NOT WITHIN THE BUDGET LINDA IN WHICH WERE SCORING THE COSTS. AND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES IN THIS BUT WE'RE WE'RE DEFINITELY HAPPY TO EXPLORE OKAY AND FINANCE ARE YOU OPEN TO THAT. I CAN'T MAKE YOU DO ANYTHING. MISTER CHAIR WITH A LITTLE MAGIC AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SO TO THE EXTENT SOME OF THE SAVINGS -- ARE KNOWN FOR PROPOSALS THAT WE LOOK AT AS DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE AB FIVE PROPOSAL WE DO SCORE THOSE -- SAVINGS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN REACH A METHODOLOGY SO -- IF -- WE'D BE HAPPY NO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU -- BECAUSE I THINK AS WE LOOK AT VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS AND PROPOSALS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HOW MUCH CANNELLA HOW MUCH COST TO DO AND HOW MUCH IT COSTS NOT TO DO THAT INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL COSTS WE'RE BUDGET COMMITTEE.

TRIPPED UP. OF LIKE HOW TO GET TO MORE. THANK GOD PAN MEMBERS OF RICE BEEN STRONG BEHALF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE -- BUT YOU WEIGH INS DISTRICT NINE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US THE TIME TO TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SUPPORT PROPOSAL YET BEFORE YOU. AS YOU'RE WHERE WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE EVEN IF THEIR INCOME EXCEEDS THE TYPICAL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY THIS EXPANDED COVERAGE LAST ONLY SIXTY DAYS AFTER THE PREGNANCY ENDS THE SHORTENED TIME FRAME BECAUSE POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH A MEDICAL. CONDITION DURING OR SHORTLY AFTER PREGNANCY SUCH AS MATERNAL MENTAL ILLNESS WHAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL DO IS EXTEND THIS COVERAGE FROM SIXTY DAYS TO ONE YEAR FROM OTHERS DIAGNOSED WITH A MENTAL. MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION THESE MOTHERS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR FULL SCOPE MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR ONE YEAR BY PROVIDING NOTE FROM THE TREATING HEALTHCARE PROVIDER OF SUCH A NOTICES IN SIXTY DAYS FROM THE BIRTH OF THEIR CHILD. IF DIAGNOSED OCCURRED AFTER THE SIXTY DAYS FROM THE CHILD'S BIRTH BUT WITHIN NINETY DAYS FROM THE DAY THE COVERAGE EXPIRED WE OPPOSE AT THE WOMAN COULD SEEK REINSTATEMENT OF MEDICAL COVERAGE. UNDER EXISTING LAW AND RECEIVE THE TREATMENT SO DESPERATE DESERVE. A LIKE INTRODUCED ARTICLE IN THE QUEUE LEGISLATIVE CO CHAIR FOR A CALL DISTRICT NINE WHO BETTER LAB AND JUST HELP POOR IN THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR THE PATIENTS THEY TREAT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANKS -- SO I'M A PRACTICING OBGYN HE RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I WANTED TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS A FACT. MANY PEOPLE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES GIVING BIRTH EACH YEAR IN THE US ARE AFFECTED. AND CBC DATA SHOWS THAT OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS ARE SUICIDE RATES HAVE INCREASED BY ABOUT TREATING THESE CONDITIONS TAKES A BIT OF TIME. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON AS RYAN ALLUDED -- TO LATE IN THE PREGNANCY OR AFTER DELIVERY. IT TAKES ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT WHEN YOU INITIATE TREATMENT AND WHEN WE RE EVALUATE WE FIND THAT OUR INITIAL TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE ABOUT 35% OF THE TIME. FOR THE OTHER 65% OF THE PATIENTS WE NEED TO LOOP BACK AND CHANGE SOMETHING AND DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. SO WE'RE REALLY UNABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE WHEN COVERAGE ENDS AT EIGHT WEEKS. M.. WHEN THESE CONDITIONS ARE UNTREATED OR INADEQUATELY TREATED IT NOT ONLY IMPACTS THE HEALTH OF THE MOTHER BUT ALSO THE NEW BORN IN THE OTHER CHILDREN AND THE FAMILY?

TO SEE AN AUDIOLOGIST OF EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE CARING FOR CALIFORNIA CCS POPULATION IN A COMMITTED TO PROVIDING TIMELY SERVICE ALL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN WITH IMPAIRED HEARING. REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE STATUS THERE'S A PROBLEM. UNFORTUNATELY A SERIES OF LONG STANDING CONCERN AS CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF AUDIOLOGIST THE FACT WE'VE BEEN FORCED TO WITHDRAW ITS PROVIDERS THE PROGRAM. THERE MANY REASONS FOR THIS NOT HOW IT THREE CORE ISSUES NUMBER ONE POINT INSUFFICIENT REIMBURSEMENTS RESULTING AUDIOLOGIST SUBSIDIZING THE COST OF CARE FOR CHILDREN.

WE MAY GET TO THAT. BECAUSE THAT'S THE NEXT ISSUE. ISSUE NUMBER FIVE OKAY MANAGE CARE ROMAN TAX. JOE DIRT SEGUE. YEAH. IT MAY BE A STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL YOU YOU DON'T KNOW -- GO AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT'S THE NEW PERSON FINANCE OF YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF. HELLO JESSICA THANK US DEPARTMENT FINANCE OKAY THANK YOU RIGHT PLEASE PROCEED YES SO YOUR AGENDA DOES A NICE JOB OF LAYING OUT THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH CALIFORNIA HAS SOUGHT. TO PUT A TAX ON MANAGED CARE A DECADE -- WE NOTE THAT THE STATE IS CURRENTLY RECEIVING -- APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND -- OFFSETS AS A RESULT OF THE TAX THAT WAS STRUCTURED BACK IN -- TWENTY SIXTEEN I THINK YOU KNOW TO THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA AROUND WHY IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- AND POTENTIAL BARRIERS FOR FEDERAL -- EITHER APPROVAL OR NOT -- TO THE SUBSEQUENT STATES AFTER CALIFORNIA RECEIVED APPROVAL FOR THEIR TAX IN TWENTY SIXTEEN HAVE BEEN. MADE SO I WOULD SAY THAT WELL WE CERTAINLY -- ARE OPEN TO DISCUSSION AROUND POTENTIAL MCO TAX EXTENSION I THINK -- SOME OF THE CALCULATION -- IN THE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT WAS AROUND HAS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION -- THAN THE ONE THAT PREVIOUSLY APPROVED THE LAST MCO TAX AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE OTHER -- TO TALLY OF THE REQUEST THAT WE WILL BE SEEKING FROM CMS OR OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAVE -- THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A CERTAIN -- CONCERN THAT OTHER THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA IS SEEKING -- MAY OR MAY NOT BE. VIEWED IN A FAVORABLE WAY FROM A FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE AND SO I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE REASONS WHY AT THIS POINT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT CONTAIN A MCO TALKS PROPOSAL BUT AGAIN. HAPPY TO TALK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON AN ONGOING BASIS ANA. OKAY -- ALEJO -- WE WE RELEASE ANALYSIS OF THE NON PROPOSAL OF THE AN EXTENSION OF THE MC ATTACKS. LAST MONTH AND WE WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY AROUND WHETHER OR NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD WOULD APPROVE ANY TAX BUT THE NEW -- BUT THE MOST RECENT TAX IN MICHIGAN WAS APPROVED BY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IT'S VERY WAS VERY SIMILARLY STRUCTURED TO HOW CALIFORNIA'S IS AND SO WE ARE NOT SURE OF WHAT RATIONALE NECESSARILY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE. FOR APPROVING MICHIGAN'S TAX WHILE REJECTING AND AN EXTENSION OF CALIFORNIA'S. MCO TAX. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S THERE ARE ALWAYS ISSUES THAT THE STATE IS WORKING WITH THE FEDS ON WITH MEDI CAL AND ANOTHER PROGRAMS -- MADE AS A SIGNIFICANT EXAMPLE IS THE THE END OF THE THIS ITERATION OF THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER -- THAT BRINGS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY INTO THE STATE. OUR UNDERSTANDING HOWEVER IS THAT -- THE OUR PROSPECTS FOR RECEIVING A SIGNIFICANT -- AND SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNDING UNDER THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER ARE SOMEWHAT CURTAILED AND IN ADDITION THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN FEET WAIVER FUNDING THAT WE DO GET IS AT IS ACTUALLY NOT AS GREAT AS WE AS THE FUNDING THAT WE GET UNDER THE MCO TAX SO. FOR THESE FOR THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE DO THINK AT IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH CONSIDERING -- PURSUING AN EXTENSION OF THE M. AND JUST RECOMMENDS THAT SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE WHICH TO WISH TO RENEW THAT IT DO SO IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE BUDGET. AS A SOLE GIVE TIME FOR BOTH THE STATE TO SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR FEDERAL APPROVAL AND MINIMIZE ANY IMPACT A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THE STATE. THANK YOU FINANCE. JUST BECAUSE I GUESS DEPARTMENT FINANCE IT WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT ADD DIRECTOR KENT MADE AT THIS TIME WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PRESENTED A BALANCED BUDGET. AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME BUT WE OF COURSE HAVE NOTED THAT OF CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE LA -- AND OTHERS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS. RIGHT THANK YOU. SYSTEM NINE UP HERE -- SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IS THAT -- APPRECIATE -- THIS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAY BE LOOKING AT WE HAVE MULTIPLE WAIVERS ARE PENDING -- SAME TIME I I THINK I WOULD AND AGAIN I'M NOT THE ONE WHO HAS TO DEAL WITH CMS DIRECTLY -- HOWEVER I WOULD DO WOULD MAKE NOTICE -- THE LA -- DID THAT -- FIRST OF ALL -- THE SIZE OF THE FIRST OF ALL THAT OUR WORLD. THAT IS AN EXTENSION OF AN EXISTING WAIVER THAT. HAD AND OTHER STATES HAVE HAD SIMILAR WIVERS APPROVED BY THIS ADMINISTRATION SO IT I THINK IT RAISES -- SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THE LIKELY DID DENY THIS PARTICULAR WAIVER NOW THAN YOU MIGHT THINK IT WAS THAT THIS DOES THAT PUT SOME FUTURE WAIVER AT RISK -- AND WELL AGAIN I'M IS THIS WAY I'M NOT THAT CONFIDENT THIS ADMINISTRATION WON'T WORK FOR EVERY EXCUSE TO DO IT WHETHER WE PUSH THIS ONE FOR NOT AND THIS ONE'S AT LEAST. IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS ONE SEVEN APPROVED. I GUESS THE OTHER ISSUES ALSO EVEN THE MAGNITUDE RIGHT SO -- THIS. TAXES ACTUALLY LARGER THAN THE EXISTING LEVEL FIFTEEN WAIVER -- SO EVEN IF THEY SHRINK IT. NOW THIS IF YOU THINK ABOUT TRADE OFFS. I'D TAKE. THE TAKE THE GREATER AMOUNT OF MONEY I GUESS -- AND SO -- SO I REALIZE THERE'S A THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MAYBE CHESS GAME THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AND NAVIGATE. AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT IT IN IN. MY OPINION IS THAT WE SHOULD CERTAINLY CONSIDER -- CONTINUING THIS ON I THINK EVER EXPRESSED -- SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY SHOULD GO HAND IN TERMS OF HELPING ENHANCER SUBSIDIES -- THAT -- SINCE IT IS A TAX OF ALL HEALTH PLANS IT'S NOT HILL AS REQUIRED BY LAW -- CMS HAS PREVIOUSLY SAID SO IN SOME SENSES IN TERMS OF TRYING TO PUT SOME OF THE BENEFITS BACK TO THE LARGER POPULATION CHAI CHIEF OUR OVERALL -- GOALS FOR GETTING COVERAGE OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE NEED A COMEDY GO TO MEDI CAL AS WELL. AND SO TO TO BUT THE THINKING SO EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL I WOULD INDICATE MY INTEREST IN PURSUING -- CONTINUATION AND TOPSY THAT WOULD INVOLVE DISCUSSIONS A VERY STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL -- BUT CERTAINLY OPEN TO ANY MAIL THOUGHTS ARE FEEDBACK ABOUT. WHAT OTHER ISSUES YOU KNOW THAT THAT THIS IS ENTANGLED IN? RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS THERE ARE. EIGHT PUBLIC COMMENT. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE URGE THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER EXTENDING THE NCO TAX THAT FOR THE POINT THAT THE LA -- RAISED I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW THAT THIS -- RAISES OVER A BILLION DOLLARS.

ALL RIGHT WE'RE MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER. THIRTEEN STRENGTHENING FISCAL ESTIMATES AND CASH FLOW MONITORING NOT IS NOT AN ISSUE WITH THE PROGRAM OF THIS TINY SIZE. EIGHT OUT SIT SO GIVEN THE SIZE AND SIGNIFICANCE ALL SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME ON THIS I'M ACTUALLY GONNA COVER ISSUE THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN JUST IN TERMS OF BACKGROUND GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATE AND BUDGET -- OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS -- WE INITIATED APARTMENT WHITE EFFORT SOURCES ARE PROCESSES THAT ARE SYSTEMS FOR FISCAL MANAGEMENT AS DIRECTOR CAMP POINTED OUT YOU KNOW MEDIC HOW ISN'T OVER HUNT ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM -- IT'S GROWN IN BOTH SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OVER THE YEARS WITHOUT THE COMMENSURATE ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES TO KEEP PACE. AND THE DISCIPLINES ON A CASH BASIS OF ACCOUNTING WHICH MAKES PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS AS WELL AS REPORTING ON THOSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AT TIMES AND JUST FOR CONTEXT. A 1% FLUCTUATION IN OUR BUDGET RESULTS IN A CHANGE OF A OF BILLION DOLLARS INTO IT OR TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- GENERAL FUND. SO IN TERMS OF THE COMPLEXITIES THAT WE FACED -- MANAGE CARE PAYMENTS HAVE INCREASED RATE 80% MORE THAN 80% OF THE POPULATION IS NOW IN MANAGED CARE WHICH ISOLATES BIG PAYMENTS INTO RELATIVELY FEW -- AND THE SOME OF THE THINGS RELATED TO THOSE ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL IN TERMS OF RATES AND APPROVAL BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADDITIONALLY AND WHEN OPERATIONAL ISSUES -- ASSOCIATED WITH -- THE MANAGED CARE PAYMENTS WE ALSO -- HAVE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE MC A TAX WILL BIT EARLIER BUT THINGS LIKE THE VARIOUS COSTS -- THEIR LARGE SUMS OF MONEY AND THEY CREATE COMPLEXITIES IN -- ADMINISTERING THOSE PROGRAMS -- ALSO WOULD HIGHLIGHT DRUG REBATE IN AND A HALF PER YEAR THE TIMING OF THOSE REBATE RECITE REBATE RECEIPTS -- IS OFTEN UNKNOWN AND OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. SO IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING IN THIS PROPOSAL AND WE'RE ASKING FOR TWENTY FIVE NEW POSITIONS TO STRENGTHEN OUR FISCAL MANAGEMENT AND CASH FLOW MONITORING. OF THE RESOURCES INCLUDE A A NEW CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER -- TO OVERSEE OUR COMPLEX FISCAL OPERATIONS BOTH IN TERMS OF ESTIMATING BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING FOR RESOURCES -- FOR ALSO ALSO REQUESTING POSITIONS FOR OUR CENTRAL FISCAL SHOPS -- THAT WE HAVE TO DEVELOP THE ESTá MEN AND MONITOR CASH FLOW. BUT EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT REQUESTING POSITIONS AND THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT FOR PROGRAMS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE EXPENDITURES HAPPENED THAT'S WHERE RECEIPTS COME IN AND SO INCREASING THAT. THAT THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS IT FISCAL MANAGEMENT IS EVERYONE'S RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE RESOURCES THAT WERE REQUESTING HERE OR TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATE WORKLOAD -- TO TO IMPROVE. OUR FISCAL INTEGRITY WERE ALSO LOOKING AT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THE SYSTEMS THAT WE USE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OUR OLD IN AN ADEQUATE IN IN MANY CASES -- SO IT ADDITIONALLY REQUEST TO ESTABLISH THE MEDI CAL DRUG REBATE FUND -- I TOUCHED ON THE DRUG REBATES WHAT WE'RE SIMPLY PROPOSING IS TO ESTABLISH A FUND TO ISOLATE THE RECEIPT OF THOSE FUNDS SO THAT WE CAN BETTER MANAGE THE TIMING OF OFFSETTING. PAYMENTS IN THE PROGRAM. OKAY THANK YOU ALEJO TREATMENTS HAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THIS WE DO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WE WOULD JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE -- HOW SERIOUS THIS ISSUE IS -- THE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FLUCTUATIONS. WHILE THEY MAY BE SMALL IN SOME CASES IN TERMS OF MEDI CAL BUDGET THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PRETTY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE OVERALL GENERAL FUND BUDGET. AND BAM IN OUR VIEW THEY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ESTABLISH LONGER TERM PRIORITIES -- FOR ALLOCATING RESOURCES BECAUSE THOSE PRIORITIES CAN BE UPSET AND DISPLACED BY BY CHANGES UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN MEDICAL COSTS -- SECOND THING ONE UNDERSCORE IS THAT -- IN A LOT OF WAYS THE THE SWINGS ARE A SYMPTOM OF THE GROWING COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAM AS WAS MENTIONED. AND THIS COMPLEXITY -- HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT -- FOR OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE TO OVERSEE THIS PROGRAM AND REALLY UNDERSTAND CLEARLY. OUT WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON OFTEN THE INFORMATION THAT -- OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS -- WOULD NEED IS NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE EVEN BE DIFFICULT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE. AND WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S. EXCUSE ME STAFF IMPERFECT STAFFING PROPOSAL. HAS MERION WE RECOMMEND THAT IT BE APPROVED -- HOWEVER WE THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO TAKE ACTION TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE MEDI CAL BUDGET FOR OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS. THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG TERM PROCESS -- AND WE AGREE WITH THEM THE DEPARTMENT'S APPROACH IF YOU KNOW CONTINUING TO LOOK AT THIS IN THE SHORT TERM -- WE THINK IT WOULD. MAKE SENSE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT -- COULD BE GAINED FROM THE APPROVAL OF THESE POSITIONS ONE EXAMPLE COULD BE -- ADDITIONAL INTERIM INFORMATION ON CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS -- SINCE THIS IS THE FOCUS OF WHAT THESE POSITIONS WOULD BE WORKING ON IN THE LONGER TERM -- TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS A PURPLE INVOLVED AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO COME FORWARD WITH A PLAN THAT WOULD HAVE SPECIFIC STEPS -- WATER TERM MORE STRUCTURAL -- ANOTHER THING THAT COULD BE DONE IS IS PERHAPS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A WORKING GROUP THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE DEPARTMENT LEGISLATIVE STAFF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO GENERATE IDEAS AND PRIORITIZE ONE OF THE WAYS TO TO BEST GO ABOUT IMPROVING THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE BUDGET IMPROVING FISCAL MANAGEMENT -- ON THE ISSUE OF THE SPECIAL FUND FOR DRUG REBATES WE THINK THAT'S A PROMISING CONCEPT THEM RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE PROVE THAT AND AND DEPENDING ON HOW THAT. WORKS -- IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SOMETHING THAT'S EXPLORE FROM OUR BROADER APPLICATION IN THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU FINANCE [inaudible] COMMENT. I THANK YOU OF FINANCE WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW GOOD FOOD I WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THIS FOR AT THIS PROPOSAL FOR A VERY LONG TIME WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR EFFORTS AND THEIR CONTINUED EFFORTS. ON THIS IT WAS A VERY COLLABORATIVE PROCESS I THINK. OF FINANCE PLEASE AT THIS PROPOSAL. AND THESE RESOURCES WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ENHANCING THE% DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS AND HANSON THE PROGRESS THEY'VE ALREADY MADE IN -- MONITORING THIS AREA. AS OUR PUBLIC COMMENT WOULD TAKING ON BOTH ISSUE THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN A SINGLE PUBLIC COMMENT -- I WOULD SAY THAT FIRST OF ALL -- I APPRECIATE -- MORE -- THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE THIS ON I MEAN THIS THIS IS BEEN AS MY THIRD YEAR CHERRY THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. IT'S KIND OF FUNNY I'LL HAVE PEOPLE COME UP AND WILL HAVE PROPOSALS YOU KNOW -- THAT THEY REMEMBERED THE ON BUTTON AND COMING UP MILLION DOLLARS YOU KNOW THAT I THINK THERE ARE NOW MORE LIKE -- SEVEN MILLION ETCETERA YEAH THESE PROPOSAL RIGHT THERE. LIKE. TWO THREE MILLION SOME WE COME. TO BETTER CAL IN RIGHT THE DRUG REBATE ALL SUDDENLY WERE OFF BY ONE POINT SOMETHING BILLION RIGHT. ALABAMA STILL ONE POINT ONE THAT SHOWS UP RIGHT WE CAN HAVE A ONE POINT. BILLION TO BILLION SWAYING. AND IT'S FRUSTRATING BUT SAME TIME I REMIND MY COLLEAGUES LIKE WELL YEAH THAT'S LIKE ONE OR 2% OF THE TIRE. MEDI CAL BUDGET RATE EVEN SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT CAN WE KEEP SOMETHING TO WITHIN ONE OR 2% THAT'S WHAT MEANS I MEAN WE HAVE BILLION DOLLAR YEAH WE HAVE BILLION TO BILLION DOLLARS SWINGS. YET THAT REPRESENTS I MEAN THINK ABOUT ALL THE PROPOSAL EVER BY A TWO BILLION DOLLARS WOULD PAY FOR UP. TO SIXTY FOUR FOR MEDI CAL FOR ALL. I MEAN THEY'LL BE HUGE. ABOUT THE RIGHT. YET THAT'S THE SWING WE GET EACH YEAR SO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER -- IT'S A MANAGE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY TO UNDERSTAND AND HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY I THINK AND I APPRECIATE THE ALEJO'S STATEMENT IS. AS I GUESS ONE QUESTION I HAVE THOUGH IS I MEAN I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING HERE -- L. IS SUGGESTING NIGHT KIND OF THINKING ALONG THE SAME LINES IN TERMS OF I MEAN. THEY SOON THIS IS NOT THE LAST SET OF STEPS BECAUSE IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED THING LIKE MAYBE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN COME TOGETHER I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY BIG PART ADMINISTRATION BUT THE EIGHT CS WITH LA -- FINANCE ME LEGISLATURE THINK ABOUT LIKE HOW WHAT'S THE BEST WAY. TO ORGANIZE THIS IN A WAY THAT WE CAN MAKE BETTER DECISIONS MORE TRANSPARENT DECISIONS THAT WE CAN DO THAT AND THAT ALSO THERE'S A COMMON UNDERSTANDING AND EXPECTATION ABOUT WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. RIGHT BECAUSE AS BECAUSE IT DOES THAT MEAN -- FUND BUDGET BILLION DOLLARS IS ALSO I MEAN THE THING IS OUR MEDI CAL PROGRAM BECAUSE IT YEAH YES MOST A LOT OF ITS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE ACTUAL GENERAL FUND PARTS ONLY. WAS A TWENTY EIGHT BILLION EIGHT THREE THREE THREE SORRY EVEN HIGHER OKAY TWENTY THREE BILLION RIGHT BUT NOT ENTIRE GENERAL FUND BUDGET IS REALLY ABOUT THE SAME SCALE WERE A LITTLE LESS IT DOES AREMEDI CAL BUDGET NOW AFTER YOU PUT ALL THE CELLS OF SO. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU SEE THIS THESE NUMBERS RUNNING ARE GOING GOING BACK AND FORTH AND AND SAID WITH THE CASH BASIS SO FORTH. MAKE HAVE HAPPY WAS LIKE OH JEEZ HOW WHAT'S THE OVER OR OR OR ACTUALLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS A TWO BILLION OPERATE AND THAT'S ONLY SO -- BUT I THINK REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT. AND SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP AND WE WANT TO GIVE YOU THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT I ALSO THINK THAT. BY COULD WE HAVE A LIKE A LARGER CONVERSATIONS LA A SUGGESTED IT. REALLY IS MUCH TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS HOW TO DO THIS IN A WAY SO WE CAN SET APPROPRIATE EXPECTATIONS I MEAN INTERNAL FINANCIAL WORKINGS OF THE ADMINISTRATION I UNDERSTANDS GOING TO BE. BETWEEN FINANCE AND THE AGENCY AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC HOW DO YOU REPORT OUT THE INFORMATION I DO SUPPORT INFORMATION AND A WHAT YOU KNOW IT AT APPROPRIATE TIMES NOW AT THE OUGHT TO JUST DO IT ONCE A YEAR IS THAT MAKES THAT THAT. MAY NOT MAKE SENSE RIGHT AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW WE BETTER COMMUNICATE -- HOW THE MONEY IF DOES FLOW AND WHAT WHAT WHAT WE EXPECTING? FROM ALL THOSE DIFFERENT POTS EVERY WAIVERS SOMETHING CHANGES RIGHT EVERY THIS SOMETHING CHANGES RIGHT SO HOW HOW WE IT'S AS THOUGH THAT WERE MADE MAKING SENSIBLE. DECISIONS IN NUMBER MAKING POLICY BASED ON NOT YOU KNOW -- POTENTIALLY WRONG ASSUMPTION WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF UNDERSTANDING WHICH IS A KNOWS PRETTY COMPLICATED. I MEAN I'LL I'LL START AND THEN CERTAINLY LET ERICA CHIME IN I THINK -- YOU KNOW I HAVE TO THE COMMAND POST ERICA AND MARY CAN'T WELL RIGHT THAT BOTH CHIEF DEPUTIES FOR YOU KNOW BOTH SIDES OF THE ORGANIZATION AND TO ERICA'S POINT EARLIER IN THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY -- TRYING TO SEXUALLY IS A CULTURAL CHANGE ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT MORE BROADLY IN TERMS OF THINGS HAPPEN AT A PROGRAM LEVEL -- THAT FROM A TIMELY COMMUNICATION STANDPOINT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF THE BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING AND FISCAL FORECASTING -- AND DEPENDING ON THE TIME FRAMES IN WHICH WE ARE CLAIMING FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE TIMING IN WHICH FEDERAL APPROVALS ARE COMING TO THE TIMING IN WHICH ARE A T. SYSTEMS CAN ACTUALLY GENERATE THE PAYMENTS OUT THE DOOR. AND THEN YOU THROW A CASH VERSUS ACCRUAL BASIS ACCOUNTING I MEAN IT'S A REMARKABLY COMPLEX -- PROGRAM AND THE FACT THAT BOTH MERION ERICA HAVE BEEN LEADING THEIR RESPECTIVE TEAMS TO SIT TOGETHER TO YOU KNOW IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE. BUT ALSO WORKING AS YOU KNOW FINANCE WOULD NOTE WITH FROM THE FINANCING THAT LEO AND THE LEGISLATURE WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR ESTIMATE. BE KNOWS INFORMATION THAT WE KNOW WHEN WE KNOW IT I'M BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT SO MUCH OF THE REST OF THE BUDGET IS INDICATIVE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE ACCURATE IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS -- I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR -- MERRY TALK ABOUT HER VISION FOR WAIVER RENEWALS AND YOU KNOW THE FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YOUR PLAN THAT JC IS WORKING WITH HER ON YOU HERE -- HER TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO CHANGE OUR RATE SETTING PROCESS WE SET SIXTEEN HUNDRED RATE CELLS A YEAR FOR EACH OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ACROSS DIFFERENT POPULATIONS -- THE COMPLEXITY OF JUST THE RATE IN AND OF ITSELF WHEN YOU THEN TAKE IT TO THE CASH IN THE ACCOUNTING AND THE APPROVALS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THERE'S GOT TO BE -- A BETTER WAY GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF HOW WE STRUCTURE THOSE RATES AND THOSE PAYMENTS AND ALL THE OTHER KINDS OF INITIATIVES AND ADD ONS AND SUBLIMINAL -- ITEMS THAT WE DO FOR HOSPITALS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND YOU KNOW. IT JUST REALLY COMPOUNDS AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP TEAM THAT IS REALLY COMMITTED. TO DOING THIS IN A THOUGHTFUL AND KIND OF PROGRESSIVE WAY I THINK THAT YOU TO THE COMMENTS AROUND THE ALLEY -- AROUND -- BRINGING MORE PEOPLE. MORE PEOPLE TO THE TABLE TO HELP US THINK IDENTIFY FOR US WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW FROM A MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT BUT ALSO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW IN ORDER TO HELP YOU KNOW EFFECTUATE THEIR LEADERSHIP AND NOTIFICATIONS. YOU KNOW WE'RE CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO SO YOU KNOW WE NEED TO PUBLICLY CALL OUT YOU KNOW BOTH ERA CAN MERRY'S LEADERSHIP IN THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL ON THIS. THANK YOU AND I THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO THAT YOU KNOW COMMITTED TO THE THE STAKEHOLDER IN PARTNER INPUT WE HAD ALWAYS ENVISIONED THAT WE JUST HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE -- AND THE SICKENING TRANSPARENCY COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY AYE YOU KNOW WE DO CASH FLOW MONITORING NOW WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED TO SPEND THIS MUCH AND TURNS OUT WE'RE ABOUT THERE YOU GO AWESOME. AND THEN YOU DRILL DOWN AND EACH OF THE THOUSAND LINE ITEMS THAT THAT MAKE UP THIS. ARE OFF BY A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION HERE AND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THEIR ONES UP IN ONE'S DOWN IN THE OFFICE THAT YOU'RE ABOUT RIGHT IT'S IT'S SUPER COMPLICATED SO. AS I LIKE TO THE THE THE WITHOUT TALKING POINT THAT I PUT IN MARY'S THERE ALL THE TIME TO SIMPLIFY. SIMPLIFY THE PROGRAMS -- WHICH I THINK WE'RE WORKING ON IT BUT THE SYSTEMS ARE WHOLLY INADEQUATE AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO GETTING THAT INPUT TO UNDERSTAND -- WHAT PEOPLE WANT AND NEED AND I MEAN WE EVEN HAVE VISIONS GOING FORWARD IF YOU KNOW RUNNING DIFFERENT MODELS DIFFERENT SCENARIOS -- WERE NOT THERE YET SO. JUST TODAY WHEN WE WERE GOING OVER TO ALL THE IT IS SPECIAL LIKE WELL HOW COME THIS ONE UP THIS NOW I HAVE A LOOK AT THE BIGGEST. THE BIGGEST MOVEMENTS AND WAS GONE THEY PICK UP ALL THE LITTLE ONES RIGHT NOW. WE APPRECIATE THAT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I HAVE REYES. IS HE GAY. RIGHT OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL. INFORMED FIRST STEP I THINK OBVIOUSLY AN ONGOING EFFORT AND OF IT HAS BIGGER IMPLICATIONS NOT ONLY FOR THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FROM OUR BUDGETING PROCESS AS WELL SO I KNOW YOU HAVE A MANAGEMENT THINGS YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH. THAT AND AND BUT ALSO IT. AND IN THE END WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER WHETHER WE AGREE OR DISAGREE. SOMETHING'S PARTICULAR THINGS OKAY.
