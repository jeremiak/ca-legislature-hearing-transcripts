00:53:19.663 --> 00:53:21.298
THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO POINT

PLANS- SO I'VE YOU HEARD THERE

00:53:26.636 --> 00:53:27.804
ARE A FEW DIFFERENT PLANS THAT

00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:28.939
THE ADMINISTRATION IS- COMPLETED

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:30.707

THOSE ARE WHAT'S INFORMING AND

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:40.350
DRIVING THIS- CERTAINLY TO THE

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:42.152
EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AT

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:43.553
AGREES IN CONCUR WITH THOSE

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.221
PRIORITIES IN THOSE PLANS- WE

00:53:45.288 --> 00:53:47.257
THINK THAT YOU KNOW THAT THESE-

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:48.792
THAT THE PACKAGE HELPS. HELPS TO

00:53:48.858 --> 00:53:50.160
PUSH THOSE FORWARD. HOWEVER IF

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:52.062
THE ADMINISTRATION BURKE THE

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:52.696
MINISTRATIONS PERSPECTIVE MAYBE

00:53:52.762 --> 00:53:53.263
A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.664
LEGISLATURE OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:56.099
HAS DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. I'M

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:57.233
CERTAINLY. THERE COULD BE

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:01.304
CHANGES THAT THAT MIGHT BE

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:02.505
MERITED. I'M THE SECOND. POINT I

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:04.441
WANTED TO BRING UP IS THAT-

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:06.876
MEASURABLE GOALS- SO IN SOME

00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:08.612
CASES SOME OF THE PROGRAMS HAVE

00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:10.347
IDENTIFIED GOALS FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:12.082
NUMBER OF ACRES TO BE TREATED OR

00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:14.751
PURCHASED HOWEVER IN OTHER CASES

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:15.652
THERE ISN'T THAT TYPE OF

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:18.688
INFORMATION- THAT MAKES IT A

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:19.489
LITTLE BIT HARD FOR THE

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:20.824
LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS OF REALLY

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:23.326
WHAT WOULD BE H. FROM THAT THE

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:25.261
PLAN. ON WHAT THIS IS THE MOST

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:27.197
COST EFFECTIVE THE PROGRAM'S HOW

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:29.199
CLOSE THIS WILL GET US TO THOSE

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:30.667
GOALS TO BE HEARD ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:33.236
WE HEARD HEARD ABOUT THIRTY BY

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:34.604
THIRTY I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:35.472
THAT THE ACTUAL QUESTION FOR THE

00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:38.041
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IS OKAY

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:39.442
IF WE- IF WE- THIS PACKAGE. YOU

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.945
KNOW WHERE WILL WE BE WE'RE- FOR

00:54:42.012 --> 00:54:43.680
AT 24% NOW. WITH THIS BRING US

00:54:43.747 --> 00:54:46.483
TO. 26% 28% WHERE WILL IT BRING

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:48.985
US. ON THAT THAT'S A DIFFICULT

00:54:49.052 --> 00:54:50.854
QUESTION TO ANSWER AND ONE THAT-

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.355
THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:53.790
INFORMATION YET TO ASSESS. FOR

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:56.192
THIS PACKAGE- AND THEN ALSO IF

00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:58.094
IT MAKES A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:58.595
THE LEGISLATURE TO HOLD

00:54:58.662 --> 00:54:59.929
ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE.

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:02.098
AFTER THE FACT- WITH REGARD TO

00:55:02.165 --> 00:55:04.200
WHAT WHAT WAS ACHIEVED FROM THE

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:07.037
PACKAGE. I'M SO WE DO THINK

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:07.637
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER.

00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:09.339
AREAS WHERE THERE IS NO CLEAR

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:11.841
MEASURABLE PLAN- BECAUSE WE

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.276
THINK THOSE ARE YOU KNOW ARE

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:14.711
AREAS THAT- ESPECIALLY THOSE

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:16.913
AREAS REALLY COULD BE COST

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.115
EFFECTIVE WE THINK THAT. THAT

00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:20.583
COULD BE SOMETHING TO LOOK AT.

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:22.252
WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME PROGRAMS

00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:23.353
APPEAR MORE- APPROPRIATE FOR ONE

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.922
TIME FUNDING THAN OTHERS SO THIS

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:26.523
PACKAGE IS A TWO YEAR PACKAGE

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:28.591
AND THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:29.526
AGREEMENT. ON THAT THE

00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:30.627
LEGISLATURE MADE LAST YEAR. BUT

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:31.961
SOMETIMES THE PROGRAM'S REALLY

00:55:32.028 --> 00:55:33.863
NATURALLY WORK FOR ONE TIME

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.965

00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:47.410
THE TYPE OF ACTIVITY THAT-

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:48.945

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:50.413
OVERTIME IT HAS TO HAPPEN N AN

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.949
ONGOING BASIS TO BE REALLY FULLY

NOT EXCLUDABLE THAT'S ANOTHER

00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:16.005
THING TO CONSIDER FOR THE

00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:17.407

AND SERVE THE OF THE- I'M FOR

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:42.392
EXAMPLE- ONE OF THE PIECES THAT

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:43.993
WAS NOTED WITH THAT HUNDRED

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:47.497
MILLION FOR TRIBAL- PROGRAMS- WE

THINK IT'S- CERTAINLY

00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:49.999
APPROPRIATE. TIME TO INVEST IN

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:52.802
AND- THE AREA SUPPORTING TRIBES.

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:55.071
ARE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:55.805
A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING FOR

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:57.440
LEGISLATORS THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:58.875
DETAIL ON HOW THAT MONEY WOULD

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:01.110

LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS WELL-

00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:03.012
WHETHER IT WOULD LIKE TO. KIND

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:03.813
OF CREATE SOME STATUTORY

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.849
STRUCTURE OR SOME PRIORITIES FOR

00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:09.285
THOSE FUNDS- ANOTHER AREA WHERE-

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:11.354
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DETAIL IS

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.156
ON THE- WILDLIFE CONSERVATION

00:58:13.223 --> 00:58:14.591
BOARD FUNDING. OF THE FUNDING

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:15.825
COULD GO TO SIX DIFFERENT

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:19.429
PROGRAMS. THAT THE BOARD WOULD

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:21.197
BE. WOULD BE. IN THE POSITION OF

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:22.298
THE FIGHTING HOTEL THOSE FINE

00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:24.667
THE PUBLIC AND- TO THE APPROACH

00:58:24.734 --> 00:58:25.935
. I'M AGAINST THE BOARD MORE

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:27.403
FLEX- BUT ALSO TO THE EXTENT THE

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:29.105
LEGISLATURE HAS PRIORITIES FOR

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:30.073
THOSE FUNDS THAT COULD. YOU

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:32.809
COULD- MEMORIALIZE THOSE. I'M

00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:35.144
THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES-

00:58:35.211 --> 00:58:36.546
THE FINAL POINT I'D LIKE TO

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.648
BRING UP IS- THAT THE PACKAGE

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:41.217
LIKE SORT OF AN OVERALL APPROACH

00:58:41.284 --> 00:58:41.851
FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND

00:58:41.918 --> 00:58:43.453
REPORTING. WE THINK IT'S REALLY

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:45.388
IMPORTANT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:46.489
AT STAKE SOME OF THESE ARE YOU

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:49.192
KNOW THE NUMBER OF CASES THEIR

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:50.560
NEW PROGRAMS- OR IN SOME CASES

00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:52.495
THERE EVEN PILOT PROGRAMS- THE

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:54.931
LEGISLATURES WE THINK THAT I

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:55.932
WANT TO KNOW. WHAT WAS ACHIEVED

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:58.334
FROM THESE FUNDS- SO THAT WE CAN

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:00.003
INFORM FUTURE DECISIONS FUTURE

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:02.071
FUNDING. I DETERMINE WHETHER WE

00:59:02.138 --> 00:59:04.107
WANT TO EXTEND FUNDING BEYOND

00:59:04.173 --> 00:59:06.009
TWO YEARS IN SOME CASES FOR

00:59:06.075 --> 00:59:07.911
THESE PROGRAMS- SO. WE THINK

00:59:07.977 --> 00:59:08.444
THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THE

00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:10.079
LEGISLATURE WILL PROBABLY WANNA

00:59:10.146 --> 00:59:13.883
WANNA CONSIDER SOME WHICH-

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:15.285

CORRECTLY THAT THAT FIFTY FOUR

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.636

SAID THAT ARE ALREADY EMBEDDED

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.551
IN THE- IN THE AGENDA AND THE-

01:00:55.618 --> 01:01:01.524
THE FIRST ONE- INQUIRES SO WHY

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.826
WE ARE SHIFTING FUNDING. FOR

01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:04.694

KNOW I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:13.403
IMPORTANT- BUT THE PAST FINDINGS

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:15.038
GONE THROUGH THE- WILDLIFE

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.172

OFFICIAL WILDLIFE WHAT'S THE

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:24.814
REASON FOR THAT WHY IS THAT WHAT

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:25.815
WAS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD BE

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.283

AGENCY THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:33.222
THINK THE ANSWER REALLY IS ABOUT

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:35.358
EXPEDITING THESE PROJECTS- THE

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:36.592
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.094

TO APPLY TO THE WCB FOR THAT

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:52.442
FUNDING TO GIVE THE SOURCE OF

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:54.744
FUNDS TO DFW WOULD ELIMINATE

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:56.712
THAT THREE TO FOUR MONTHS DELAY

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:57.880

KIND OF FUNDING OVER TO- DFW NO

WE THINK HAVING TO STREAMS OF

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:17.834
FUNDING ALLOWS US TO WORK WITH A

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.968
BROADER ARRAY OF PARTNERS AROUND

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:23.005
THE STATE. OKAY OF. THE

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:24.107
COMMISSION FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:26.309
THAT SPECIFIC CHURCH THING AND

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:30.146
THAT IS SO IF- IF DFW HAS

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:31.681
EXHAUSTED THEIR FUNDS THEY COULD

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:35.351
pRIGHT FOR THE FUNDING OR ABOUT

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:36.686
THE OTHER WAY AROUND COULD

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:39.021
PEOPLE APPLY TO DFW FOR THEIR

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:40.923
FUNDING. IF THAT'S TRUE BECAME

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:42.458
LOOK AT YOU I THINK THAT'S RIGHT

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:44.560
I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE DIRECTOR

01:02:44.627 --> 01:02:45.995
AVAILABLE REMOTELY YEAH LET'S DO

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.331

ON THAT SO IF YOU- IF YOU HAVE A

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:53.870
PROJECT- THAT WOULD SEEM. QUITE

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:56.606
LOGICAL FOR THE APPLICANT TO

01:02:56.672 --> 01:03:00.476
APPLY TO BOTH AGENCIES. AND THAT

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:02.378
SEEMS MORE COMPLEX TO ME BUT AT

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:06.215
LEAST FROM NAY- PERSPECTIVE OF-

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:09.685
OF THE- PROJECT MANAGERS. LET'S

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:10.653
BRING IN DOCTOR BOTTOM AND SEE

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.556
IF HE CAN. HELP US WALK THROUGH

AN EXAMPLE MAYBE. THANK YOU

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:16.626
CHAIR FOR THE QUESTION AND THOSE

01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:18.427
ARE GREAT ANSWERS BUT- IT'S N.

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:20.897
C. DEPUTY SECRETARIES I THINK

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.900
THERE ARE SEVERAL BENEFITS. FROM

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:27.470
THIS APPROACH BUT. MOST

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:29.138
IMPORTANTLY I'D SAY I DON'T

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:30.306
THINK IT'S AN EITHER OR I DON'T

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:32.375
THINK IT'S EITHER W. C. B. OR

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:35.511
DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE THE SCALE OF

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.280
THE CHALLENGE AND THE IMPORTANCE

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:39.182
OF FIXING THESE QUARTER PROBLEMS

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:41.317
IS SO LARGE IT'S GOING TO TAKE

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:43.386
IN ALL THE ABOVE AND EVERYBODY.

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:45.254
SO HERE ARE A COUPLE OF THE

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:47.623
BENEFITS. FIRST I THINK IT'S

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.792
EXPERIENCE IN HISTORY. THE

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:51.727
LEGISLATURE IS FUNDED OVER THE

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:53.362
DECADE I'VE BEEN DIRECTOR OF

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:54.764
VARIETY OF THINGS THAT HAVE

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.766
PRODUCED THE EVIDENCE AND THE

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:58.901
INFORMATION WE'VE DONE THE

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:01.170
ESSENTIAL MAPPING OF ALL THE

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:03.039
LIKELY TOP TIER CORRIDOR

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:05.374
CHALLENGES WE'VE DONE THE SAME

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:09.445
THING ON THE FISH PASSAGE FROM

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:10.279
ALONG THE WHOLE COASTAL ZONE.

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:13.216
THE STATE'S. AND SEE SO WE HAVE

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:15.318
THE IN HOUSE SCIENTIST WHO ARE

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:17.887
THE EXPERTS ON THE BEARS AND THE

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:20.056
BOBCATS AND- THE CRITTERS THAT

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:21.791
EITHER ARE AFFECTED BY OR WILL

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:25.494
BENEFIT FROM. A SECOND- BENEFIT

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:29.799
IS IT'S POTENTIALLY FASTER AS A

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:30.299
DEPUTY SECRETARY NORRIS

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:34.403
MENTIONED. SO TO TAKE AN EXAMPLE

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.439
IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TOOK TO

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:38.808
DROUGHT FUNDING THE DEPARTMENT-

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:40.977
PURSUED A GRANT FROM THE W. C.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:42.979
B. TO SPORT FISH PASSAGE

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.948
PROJECTS AND THE BOARD PROCESS

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:47.917
ADDED ABOUT THREE MONTHS TO THE

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:50.386
OVERALL TIMELINE FOR US TO GET

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:52.321
THE MONEY OUT IN THE FIELD TO

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:56.225
FIX SOME- CORRIDOR PROBLEMS SO

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:57.360
THERE IS A FASTER BENEFIT

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:59.262
POTENTIALLY. THIRD BENEFIT THERE

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:02.999
ARE SYNERGIES AT THE VERY TIME.

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:06.168
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BUDGET

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:07.970
FOR DOING THE ACTUAL PROJECTS.

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:09.505
THE DEPARTMENT WILL ALSO BE

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:12.108
CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING AS AN

01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:13.709
EXAMPLE SENATE BILL SEVEN NINETY

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:15.044
. WHICH IS THE STRUCTURE TO

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:17.079
CREATE THE MITIGATION CREDITS

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:19.415
POTENTIALLY FOR PROPONENTS WHO

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:20.449
ARE DOING THESE TYPES OF

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:22.685
PROJECTS AND I THINK HAVING SOME

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.720
FUNDING AT THE DEPARTMENT AND

01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:26.322
THE DEPARTMENT ENGAGED IN THOSE

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:29.191
VENUES COULD CREATE SYNERGIES

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:30.326
THAT ALLOW US TO DO MORE

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:32.695
PROJECTS. NEXT IN A FIT IN THIS

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:35.164

CONTRIBUTE TO DOING THESE

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:50.046
PROJECTS. AND THEN THE LAST

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:52.448
BENEFIT IS THE DEPARTMENT IS

CASES PENALTIES HAVE NOT BEEN

01:53:44.384 --> 01:53:45.685
INCREASED IN SEVERAL DECADES ON

01:53:45.752 --> 01:53:47.887
A BUS LOST THEIR ABILITY TO

01:53:47.954 --> 01:53:49.856
DETER VIOLATIONS OVER TIME-

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:51.024
INCREASES COULD INCLUDE

PROPOSED PENALTY LEVELS WHICH

01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:55.862
APPEAR REASONABLE. ARE SETTING

01:53:55.929 --> 01:53:57.363
PENALTY LEVEL SOMEWHAT HIGHER

01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:58.698
LOWER BASED ON WHAT THE

LEGISLATURE DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

01:54:00.567 --> 01:54:01.935
AND THEN FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S

01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:03.403

ON THE PLUS SIDE IMPORTANT

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:30.290
PROGRAM. HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:55:30.356 --> 01:55:31.924
PESTICIDE REGULATION CONSIDERED

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:33.092
INCREASING FUNDING FOR OTHER

01:55:33.159 --> 01:55:36.696
ENFORCEMENT. OPTIONS AND IN

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:39.032
PARTICULAR. SCHOOLS A PAST SIDE

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:40.600
. SHOULD USE NEAR SCHOOLS EXCEPT

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:41.801
HER TO BE ABLE TO HELP

01:55:41.868 --> 01:55:43.569
AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER SWISS

01:55:43.636 --> 01:55:46.339
THAT ISSUE IT IS- AN EXTREMELY

01:55:46.406 --> 01:55:49.409
SENSITIVE ISSUE IN THE STATE IS

01:55:49.475 --> 01:55:51.778
MANNED- COULD. YOU HELP ME WITH

01:55:51.844 --> 01:55:52.612
THAT WHAT'S YOUR POSITION ON

THAT AND ARE YOU CONSIDERING

01:55:54.547 --> 01:55:56.649
THAT. SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:55:56.716 --> 01:55:58.384
OF A QUESTION ONE OF THE THINGS

01:55:58.451 --> 01:56:00.787
THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:56:00.853 --> 01:56:02.655
DOING IS TRYING TO GET A BETTER

01:56:02.722 --> 01:56:05.224
HANDLE ON COMPLIANCE- WITH- THE

01:56:05.291 --> 01:56:07.427
CURRENT REGULATIONS THAT APPLY

01:56:07.493 --> 01:56:09.095
TO PESTICIDE REGULAR USE AROUND

01:56:09.162 --> 01:56:12.565
SCHOOLS- THE CURRENT REPORTING-

01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:13.933
IS. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.768
NECESSARILY CAPTURE THE ACCURATE

01:56:15.835 --> 01:56:17.337
LOCATION ON A PARTICULAR FIELD

01:56:17.403 --> 01:56:19.072
GIVEN THE NATURE OF REPORTING SO

01:56:19.138 --> 01:56:20.473
WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE AYE

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:21.607
COMMISSIONERS TO PROVIDE

01:56:21.674 --> 01:56:23.743
GUIDANCE TO ALLOW GROWERS TO

01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:25.278
BETTER AND MORE ACCURATELY

01:56:25.345 --> 01:56:25.945
IDENTIFY WHERE THOSE

01:56:26.012 --> 01:56:27.747
APPLICATIONS ARE HAPPENING. AND

01:56:27.814 --> 01:56:29.349
SO ONCE WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE

01:56:29.415 --> 01:56:32.452
OF- THE COMPLIANCE WILL EVALUATE

01:56:32.518 --> 01:56:33.386
WHETHER WE HAVE TO WHETHER

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:34.687
ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT RULES

01:56:34.754 --> 01:56:37.090
WOULD BE EFFECTIVE WE'RE ALSO

01:56:37.156 --> 01:56:38.791
WORKING WITH SCHOOLS TO. WORK

01:56:38.858 --> 01:56:40.560
MORE CLOSELY WITH THEM TO GET A

01:56:40.626 --> 01:56:42.628
BETTER SENSE OF WHETHER THERE

01:56:42.695 --> 01:56:44.030
ARE VIOLATIONS OCCURRING- THAT

01:56:44.097 --> 01:56:45.598
WE MAY NOT BE AWARE OF AND SO

01:56:45.665 --> 01:56:47.500
ONCE WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:48.701
WELL IT WILL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK

01:56:48.768 --> 01:56:50.103
AT WHETHER. WE SHOULD ADOPT ANY

01:56:50.169 --> 01:56:50.670
ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT TOOLS

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:52.505
FROM AROUND SCHOOL IT IS

01:56:52.572 --> 01:56:53.239
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST

01:56:53.306 --> 01:56:55.241
EXPLOSIVE TOPICS WE HAVE OUT

01:56:55.308 --> 01:56:56.509
THERE. BUT BASED ON SOME

01:56:56.576 --> 01:56:58.611
EXPERIENCES THAT WE'VE HAD IN.

01:56:58.678 --> 01:57:00.346
THE VENTURA COUNTY WHO WERE ONCE

01:57:00.413 --> 01:57:03.082
IT HAPPENS IT'S A GROUP EARLY ON

01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:07.353

TO BUT I'M READING AND IT SEEMS

01:57:20.166 --> 01:57:21.868
LIKE THERE'S THAT A PING PONG

01:57:21.934 --> 01:57:22.402
BACK AND FORTH YOU HAD IT

01:57:22.468 --> 01:57:24.871
ALREADY EXPIRED AND THAT YOU'RE

ASKING FOR THE FORTY BACK- WHY

01:57:28.074 --> 01:57:30.109
WHY ARE YOU ASKING FOR THE

01:57:30.176 --> 01:57:31.744
AUTHORITY BACK IS OR SOMETHING

01:57:31.811 --> 01:57:32.812
THAT'S- THAT THE CA SEES AREN'T

01:57:32.879 --> 01:57:34.781
DOING. WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE

01:57:34.847 --> 01:57:36.749
RATIONALE- THANKS FOR THE

01:57:36.816 --> 01:57:38.284
QUESTION AND YOU'RE CORRECT WE

01:57:38.351 --> 01:57:39.786
DID HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND IT

01:57:39.852 --> 01:57:41.988
EXPIRED AND SO WE ARE- WE'RE

01:57:42.054 --> 01:57:43.990
ASKING TO HAVE IT REINSTATED THE

01:57:44.056 --> 01:57:46.225
REASON- THAT WE ARE REQUESTING

01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:48.060
ADDITIONAL THIRTY IS FOR IT TO

01:57:48.127 --> 01:57:50.430
PARTICULAR TYPES OF CASES- ONE

01:57:50.496 --> 01:57:52.265
OF WHICH WOULD BE. CASES WHERE

01:57:52.331 --> 01:57:53.232
VIOLATIONS ARE HAPPENING IN

01:57:53.299 --> 01:57:56.169
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS- AND THE

01:57:56.235 --> 01:57:57.737
OTHER IS IF AN AGRICULTURAL

01:57:57.804 --> 01:57:59.639
COMMISSIONER IS OF NOT

01:57:59.705 --> 01:58:01.340
FULFILLING- IF HIS OR HER

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:04.410
DUTIES- AND SO THE I THINK THE

01:58:04.477 --> 01:58:06.012
IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND IS

01:58:06.078 --> 01:58:06.712
IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR STATE

01:58:06.779 --> 01:58:08.548
OVERSIGHT ROLE OF THE PESTICIDE

01:58:08.614 --> 01:58:11.150
REGULATORY PROGRAM. WE PROVIDE

01:58:11.217 --> 01:58:13.753
AS AS THE L. A. O. MENTION A

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:16.022
BACKSTOP- IN CASES WHERE- NUMBER

01:58:16.088 --> 01:58:17.557
ONE IF THE ACTION IS NOT BEING

01:58:17.623 --> 01:58:19.292
TAKEN BUT NUMBER TWO IN A MULTI

01:58:19.358 --> 01:58:20.460
JURISDICTIONAL CONTACTS WHERE

01:58:20.526 --> 01:58:22.829
IT'S JUST FAR MORE COMPLEX- FOR

01:58:22.895 --> 01:58:23.796
INDIVIDUAL COMMISSIONERS TO

01:58:23.863 --> 01:58:26.365
EFFECTIVELY. ENFORCE THOSE TYPES

01:58:26.432 --> 01:58:30.136
OF VIOLATIONS SORT IS YOUR

01:58:30.203 --> 01:58:30.603
CONCLUSION THEN THAT

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:31.637
COMMISSIONERS CAN'T WORK

01:58:31.704 --> 01:58:33.639
TOGETHER THAT OUT THAT THE STATE

01:58:33.706 --> 01:58:36.209
HAS TO COME IN AND DO IT. NO NOT

01:58:36.275 --> 01:58:38.211
AT ALL- IT'S JUST A MORE COMPLEX

01:58:38.277 --> 01:58:39.745
UNDERTAKING- WHEN THERE ARE

01:58:39.812 --> 01:58:41.380
VIOLATIONS HAPPENING IN MULTIPLE

01:58:41.447 --> 01:58:44.050
JURISDICTIONS AND IN ADDITION

01:58:44.116 --> 01:58:45.918
THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE- FOR

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:48.154
EXAMPLE WE HAD IT RESET ACTION-

01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:49.555
AGAINST AN AERIAL APPLICATOR

01:58:49.622 --> 01:58:52.091
WHO- BECAUSE DRIFT INCIDENTS ON

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:53.993
SOCCER FIELD SCHOOLS IN MULTIPLE

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:56.562
DIFFERENT CROPS AND WE ENGAGED-

01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:58.030
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AS

01:58:58.097 --> 01:59:00.533
PART OF THAT AND- SO IN CASES

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:02.134
WHERE IT. WE WANT TO REFER A

01:59:02.201 --> 01:59:03.603
CASE- FOR EXAMPLE TO THE

01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:05.204
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OUR

01:59:05.271 --> 01:59:07.206
ENGAGEMENT HELPS TO COORDINATE

01:59:07.273 --> 01:59:09.775
THE ACTIVITIES. AND SO I JUST

01:59:09.842 --> 01:59:10.877
ITSIT PROVIDES A MORE

01:59:10.943 --> 01:59:14.180
COMPREHENSIVE. OVERSIGHT TO

01:59:14.247 --> 01:59:15.214
ENFORCEMENT. SALEMME DOUBLE

01:59:15.281 --> 01:59:16.549
DEEPER HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE ST

01:59:16.616 --> 01:59:18.117
THERE ISN'T ANY PROBLEM BUT YOU

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:20.386
WANT THE AUTHORITY. WHY WOULDN'T

01:59:20.453 --> 01:59:22.154
YOU JUST INCREASED THAT THE

01:59:22.221 --> 01:59:24.323
ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES UNDER

01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:25.391
THE CURRENT PROGRAM WITHIN THE

01:59:25.458 --> 01:59:28.761
COUNTIES. I'M AS YOU SAID THAT

01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:30.329

THIS YEAR'S USE RIGHT NOW. NO I

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:35.468
GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS I THINK

01:59:35.535 --> 01:59:37.537
IT'S MORE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BE

01:59:37.603 --> 01:59:39.305
MORE EFFECTIVE IN OUR OVERSIGHT

01:59:39.372 --> 01:59:40.673
ROLE IF WE ARE ABLE TO BE

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:43.843
RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING ACTION

01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:44.911
WHEN THERE ARE VIOLATIONS IN

01:59:44.977 --> 01:59:46.846
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AS

01:59:46.913 --> 01:59:48.548
OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS.

01:59:48.614 --> 01:59:50.416
BY INDIVIDUAL COUNTY AG

01:59:50.483 --> 01:59:53.719
COMMISSIONERS. SO HOW SO HEY.

01:59:53.786 --> 01:59:55.688
I'M I'M TRYING TO I'M TRYING TO

01:59:55.755 --> 01:59:56.989
PUT THE TWO SCENARIOS A MAN

01:59:57.056 --> 01:59:58.658
TRYING TO PUT THE TWO ARGUMENTS

01:59:58.724 --> 02:00:00.359
THAT YOU BAY TOGETHER THERE IS

02:00:00.426 --> 02:00:02.228
NO PROBLEM NOW. BUT YOU'RE

02:00:02.295 --> 02:00:04.096
ASKING FOR THE AUTHORITY. AND IN

02:00:04.163 --> 02:00:05.498
SOME OUT YOU I SAID WHY CAN'T

02:00:05.565 --> 02:00:06.966
THE COUNTY AND AGRICULTURE

02:00:07.033 --> 02:00:08.334
COMMISSIONS WORK TOGETHER AND

02:00:08.401 --> 02:00:10.636
YOU SAID THEY CAN BUT YOU'D BE

02:00:10.703 --> 02:00:12.138
BETTER. SO BUT IF THE COUNTY

02:00:12.204 --> 02:00:13.306
COMMISSIONERS CAN ALREADY WORK

02:00:13.372 --> 02:00:15.608
TOGETHER DO AN INVESTIGATION GO

02:00:15.675 --> 02:00:16.676
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND YOU

02:00:16.742 --> 02:00:17.743
INCREASE THE PENALTIES ALREADY

02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:19.211
WITHIN THE POWER WITHIN THE CA

02:00:19.278 --> 02:00:20.880
SEES WHY NOT ALLOW THAT INSTEAD

02:00:20.947 --> 02:00:22.481
OF CREATING A WHOLE NEW

02:00:22.548 --> 02:00:25.585
AUTHORITY- FIT. THE QUESTION I

02:00:25.651 --> 02:00:28.187
SHOULD STEP BACK AND SAY THAT-

02:00:28.254 --> 02:00:29.922
WE ARE STICKING NOT AUTHORITY AT

02:00:29.989 --> 02:00:32.091
THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL. SO

02:00:32.158 --> 02:00:34.260
THAT WHEN WE WERE FOR TODAY-

02:00:34.327 --> 02:00:36.329
THE- CASE AT THE ATTORNEY

02:00:36.395 --> 02:00:38.331
GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT WAS WE

02:00:38.397 --> 02:00:39.498
UNDERTAKE THAT ACTION THAT

02:00:39.565 --> 02:00:40.600
PARTICULAR ACTION A LICENSING

02:00:40.666 --> 02:00:43.269
CONTEXT WHAT WE'RE SEEKING AND

02:00:43.336 --> 02:00:44.770
THIS CASE IS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE

02:00:44.837 --> 02:00:45.938
AND FOR PESTICIDE USE

02:00:46.005 --> 02:00:47.907
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. SO IF AN

02:00:47.974 --> 02:00:49.542
AGRICULTURAL COMMISSION AND

02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:51.644
COUNTY A SUBPOPULATION AND THE

02:00:51.711 --> 02:00:54.180
SAME- GROWER WAS COMMITTING A

02:00:54.246 --> 02:00:55.948
VIOLATION COUNTY . THOSE

02:00:56.015 --> 02:00:57.116
ACTIONS WOULD OCCUR

02:00:57.183 --> 02:00:58.551
INDEPENDENTLY AND POTENTIALLY

02:00:58.618 --> 02:01:00.653
NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT

02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:02.221
THE OVERALL ACTION OF. THAT

02:01:02.288 --> 02:01:05.157
PARTICULAR ACTOR AND SO IF WE AS

02:01:05.224 --> 02:01:07.093
DPR WERE ABLE TO. TAKE A LOOK

02:01:07.159 --> 02:01:09.028
AND BE ABLE TO ENFORCE AGAINST

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:11.197
BOTH OF THOSE VIOLATIONS. WE

02:01:11.263 --> 02:01:12.965
BELIEVE IT WOULD BE MORE

02:01:13.032 --> 02:01:13.899
EFFECTIVE- BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE

02:01:13.966 --> 02:01:15.334
A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH AND BE

02:01:15.401 --> 02:01:17.737
ABLE TO SEE. THAT THERE ARE

02:01:17.803 --> 02:01:18.871
MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS AS OPPOSED

02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:19.405
TO INDIVIDUAL VIOLATIONS

02:01:19.472 --> 02:01:21.507
HAPPENING IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES

02:01:21.574 --> 02:01:23.876
SO YOU'RE SAYING. A GOOD ADD

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:26.045
THIS THIS- TYPE OF AUTHORITY AND

02:01:26.112 --> 02:01:27.313
HEARING OF A THIRTEEN. OTHER

02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:29.415
STATE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT

02:01:29.482 --> 02:01:32.084
AUTHORITIES OF THE L. A. O. PER

02:01:32.151 --> 02:01:34.387
PART NOTE CPSC HAS SIMILAR.

02:01:34.453 --> 02:01:40.092
COVER CYCLE. AUTHOR BLACK. MY

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:41.794
CHARACTER OF SIR VIOLATE NEED.

02:01:41.861 --> 02:01:44.130
AGENTS TO BE ABLE TO. AND TAKEN.

02:01:44.196 --> 02:01:45.998
ACTIONS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION

02:01:46.065 --> 02:01:47.900
WITH THE COMMISSIONERS. OKAY BUT

02:01:47.967 --> 02:01:49.568
YOU'RE SAYING OTHER OTHER

02:01:49.635 --> 02:01:50.670
AGENCIES HAVE THE AUTHORITY WHEN

02:01:50.736 --> 02:01:52.672
I TALK ABOUT AGENCIES ARE DONE

02:01:52.738 --> 02:01:55.174
WITH THIS ONE SO WHY DID THE WHY

02:01:55.241 --> 02:02:00.713
DID THE AUTHORITY LAPSE. C.

02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:02.281
THIRTY LAST IN AT LEAST TWO

02:02:02.348 --> 02:02:05.518
THOUSAND SIX- AND WAS- AND PART

02:02:05.584 --> 02:02:08.087
OF A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS TO THE

02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:09.321
STATUTE THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT

02:02:09.388 --> 02:02:11.323
THE OVERALL PENALTY LEVELS AND

02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:12.525
SO AT THE TIME THE PENALTY

02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:14.393
LEVELS WERE MIRRORING BOTH STATE

02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:16.662
AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND SO I

02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:17.463
CAN'T COME INTO THE FULL

02:02:17.530 --> 02:02:19.398
DECISION MAKING THAT WAS MADE AT

02:02:19.465 --> 02:02:21.400
THAT TIME BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS

02:02:21.467 --> 02:02:24.170
TIED TO- THE DIFFERENT COUNCILS

02:02:24.236 --> 02:02:25.938
OR INCREASED ON THE-

02:02:26.005 --> 02:02:26.972
COMMISSIONER ADMINISTRATIVE

02:02:27.039 --> 02:02:29.608
AUTHORITY. OKAY SO ANY ANALYSIS

02:02:29.675 --> 02:02:32.578
IT SAID THAT AB NINE FOUR SEVEN

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:35.848
ALLOWED THE AUTHORITY TO SUNSET-

02:02:35.915 --> 02:02:38.284
I GUESS I'M I'M STRUGGLING TO

02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:40.586
UNDERSTAND. NOT THAT THAT WE

02:02:40.653 --> 02:02:42.388
DON'T NEED TO DO ENFORCEMENT OR

02:02:42.455 --> 02:02:44.423
NOT TO DO PENALTIES IF THAT IS

02:02:44.490 --> 02:02:46.058
THERE A PROBLEM IN THE CURRENT

02:02:46.125 --> 02:02:47.159
SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES NEW

02:02:47.226 --> 02:02:48.894
AUTHORITY OR CAN THE EXISTING

02:02:48.961 --> 02:02:51.330
PROGRAM WORK AND WE INCREASE THE

02:02:51.397 --> 02:02:53.432
PENALTIES. BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:55.301
YOU THE YOU THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:56.469
THAT IF AN ACT COMMISSIONER IS

02:02:56.535 --> 02:02:57.903
NOT FULFILLING THEIR DUTIES BUT

02:02:57.970 --> 02:02:59.772
YOUHAVE NO EXAMPLE ACT MR NOT

02:02:59.839 --> 02:03:02.675
FILLING THEIR DUTIES. I THINK

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:05.578
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS- BE

02:03:05.644 --> 02:03:07.379
PROACTIVE AND ANTICIPATE

02:03:07.446 --> 02:03:08.914
SITUATIONS WHERE WE WANT THE

02:03:08.981 --> 02:03:10.916
STATE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. ALL OF

02:03:10.983 --> 02:03:12.752
THE AVAILABLE TOOLS NECESSARY TO

02:03:12.818 --> 02:03:14.520
EFFECTIVELY. ENFORCE THE STATE'S

02:03:14.587 --> 02:03:16.622
PESTICIDE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

02:03:16.689 --> 02:03:17.256
TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE

02:03:17.323 --> 02:03:19.425
ENVIRONMENT. AND NOT WANT TO

02:03:19.492 --> 02:03:21.494
HAVE TO UN RING A BELL THAT'S

02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:22.795
ALREADY HAPPENED AND SO. THIS IS

02:03:22.862 --> 02:03:24.663
NOT. THAT WOULD NOT BE AN OPTION

02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:27.032
THAT WE WOULD TAKE LIGHTLY UNDER

02:03:27.099 --> 02:03:27.700
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD ONLY

02:03:27.767 --> 02:03:29.268
BE AN EXTREME CASE WHERE ACTION

02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:31.403
ISN'T BEING TAKEN. AND I THINK

02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:32.538
GOING BACK TO THE MULTI

02:03:32.605 --> 02:03:34.940
JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE IF I MAY I

02:03:35.007 --> 02:03:37.676
THINK- IF THERE WAS AN ACTION

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:39.478
THAT OF A GROUP OR FOR EXAMPLE A

02:03:39.545 --> 02:03:41.680
VIOLATION TOOK PLACE IN COUNTY A

02:03:41.747 --> 02:03:42.782
AND SO THAT I COMMISSIONER IS

02:03:42.848 --> 02:03:45.151
LOOKING JUST AT THAT. VIOLATION

02:03:45.217 --> 02:03:46.919
AND IS CONSIDERING A FINE LEVEL

02:03:46.986 --> 02:03:48.587
BASED ON THAT SINGLE VIOLATION.

02:03:48.654 --> 02:03:49.555
AND THEN THERE'S A SEPARATE

02:03:49.622 --> 02:03:51.557
ACTION TAKING PLACE IN ANOTHER

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:52.958
COUNTY AND AGAIN NOT AYE

02:03:53.025 --> 02:03:54.426
COMMISSIONER IS LOOKING JUST AT

02:03:54.493 --> 02:03:56.395
THAT CASE DOT VIOLATION. WE AT

02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:57.997
THE STATE LEVEL WOULD STEP BACK

02:03:58.063 --> 02:04:00.366
AND SAY OKAY THIS ACTOR IS.

02:04:00.432 --> 02:04:01.901
VIOLATING IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES

02:04:01.967 --> 02:04:03.502
AND SO WE WILL LOOK BELIEVE THAT

02:04:03.569 --> 02:04:05.538
THAT DESERVES A HIGHER LEVEL OF

02:04:05.604 --> 02:04:07.873
FINE AND PENALTY. GIVEN THE

02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:09.008
MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS THAT ARE

02:04:09.074 --> 02:04:10.843
TAKING PLACE EACH INDIVIDUAL AYE

02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:12.244
COMMISSIONER WOULD ONLY HAVE THE

02:04:12.311 --> 02:04:14.847
ABILITY TO EXAMINE AND CONSIDER.

02:04:14.914 --> 02:04:16.849
THE VIOLATION AND HIS OR HER

02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:18.083
COUNTY IN ASSESSING FINE BUT

02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:19.618
UNDER THAT OKAY SO LET'S LET'S

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:22.822
GO FORWARD WITH THAT EXAMPLE.

02:04:22.888 --> 02:04:26.125
THEN WHY NOT JUST INCREASE. ****

02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:27.760
WITHIN EACH. SO IF THERE'S

02:04:27.827 --> 02:04:29.028
MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS I SAY YOU

02:04:29.094 --> 02:04:30.296
YOU INCREASE THE PENALTIES SO

02:04:30.362 --> 02:04:32.198
THAT THAT PERSON PAYS MULTIPLE

02:04:32.264 --> 02:04:38.470
PENALTIES IN BOTH JURISDICTIONS. I COMMISSIONER AND COUNTY A IS

02:04:38.537 --> 02:04:40.639
GOING TO BE CONSIDERING THE

02:04:40.706 --> 02:04:42.775
VIOLATION IN HIS OR HER COUNTY.

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:43.742
AND SIMILARLY THE AG

02:04:43.809 --> 02:04:45.477
COMMISSIONER AND COUNTY B. IS

02:04:45.544 --> 02:04:46.412
GOING TO BE CONSIDERING A

02:04:46.478 --> 02:04:48.848
VIOLATION AS A AND HIS OR HER

02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:50.216
COUNTY. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

02:04:50.282 --> 02:04:52.852
BE CONSIDERING THE MULTITUDE OF

02:04:52.918 --> 02:04:54.854
VIOLATIONS THAT THAT ACTOR HAS

02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:55.921
COMMITTED WE AT THE STATE LEVEL

02:04:55.988 --> 02:04:58.824
AND OVERSEEING THE- ENFORCEMENT

02:04:58.891 --> 02:05:00.159
AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL AND LOOKING

02:05:00.226 --> 02:05:01.260
AT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

02:05:01.327 --> 02:05:03.329
VIOLATIONS. WOULD BE ABLE TO AN

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:04.830
APPROPRIATELY CONSIDER THOSE

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:06.966
MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS AND COMING

02:05:07.032 --> 02:05:09.435
UP WITH A FINE LEVEL. OKAY I

02:05:09.501 --> 02:05:15.875
GUESS- I SEE. WHAT WOULD BE THE

02:05:15.941 --> 02:05:17.409
DIFFERENCE THEN BETWEEN MIGHT

02:05:17.476 --> 02:05:19.478
MIGHT Y. SCENARIO YOUR SCENARIO

02:05:19.545 --> 02:05:20.679
HERE YOU'RE JUST ASKING TO

02:05:20.746 --> 02:05:23.949
AGGREGATE AND- AND SOMEHOW

02:05:24.016 --> 02:05:25.918
IMPOSE A FINE WHERE I'M SAYING

02:05:25.985 --> 02:05:28.387
THE INCREASE THE FINES ON AND AT

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:30.422
AT AT AT EACH LEVEL AND SO EACH

02:05:30.489 --> 02:05:32.558
VIOLATION HAS A HIGHER FINE UP

02:05:32.625 --> 02:05:34.760
FROM. I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO

02:05:34.827 --> 02:05:37.263
SAY IS OUR ROLE IS MORE THAN AN

02:05:37.329 --> 02:05:39.498
AGGREGATOR OUR ROLE IS LOOKING

02:05:39.565 --> 02:05:41.500
AT A TOTAL PICTURE BECAUSE IT

02:05:41.567 --> 02:05:43.302
AND I COMMISSIONER WILL LOOK AT

02:05:43.369 --> 02:05:45.638
A VIOLATION IN HIS OR HER COUNTY

02:05:45.704 --> 02:05:47.273
AND REALLY CONSIDERED JUST

02:05:47.339 --> 02:05:49.141
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HIS OR HER

02:05:49.208 --> 02:05:50.509
COUNTY AS OPPOSED TO OUR ROLE

02:05:50.576 --> 02:05:52.378
WHICH WOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT

02:05:52.444 --> 02:05:54.546
THE OVERALL STATEWIDE ACTIVITIES

02:05:54.613 --> 02:05:56.982
AND VIOLATIONS OF THAT

02:05:57.049 --> 02:05:58.183
PARTICULAR AFTER. SO IT'S

02:05:58.250 --> 02:06:00.486
GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS JUST

02:06:00.552 --> 02:06:02.688
A VIA A PENALTY OF A THOUSAND

02:06:02.755 --> 02:06:04.156
DOLLARS IN ONE COUNTY IN THE

02:06:04.223 --> 02:06:06.025
THOUSAND DOLLAR FILE. PENALTY IN

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:06.926
ANOTHER AND WE'RE SAYING THIS

02:06:06.992 --> 02:06:09.094
ACTOR IS THIS REGARDING THE LAW

02:06:09.161 --> 02:06:10.429
IS COMMITTING MULTIPLE

02:06:10.496 --> 02:06:12.932
VIOLATIONS WE THINK THAT'S-

02:06:12.998 --> 02:06:14.066
WORTH THE PENALTY OF FIVE

02:06:14.133 --> 02:06:16.669
THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO I WE HAVE A

02:06:16.735 --> 02:06:18.137
IN A BROADER STATEWIDE WE HAVE A

02:06:18.203 --> 02:06:19.905
BROADER STATEWIDE OVERSIGHT ROLE

02:06:19.972 --> 02:06:21.173
THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL I

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:23.108
COMMISSIONER ASSURANCE HAS ARE

02:06:23.175 --> 02:06:25.611
COUNTING. I WILL I GOT ANOTHER

02:06:25.678 --> 02:06:27.179
QUESTION I JUST I DON'T BELIEVE

02:06:27.246 --> 02:06:29.481
AT THAT POINT I JUST I'M JUST

02:06:29.548 --> 02:06:30.416
TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF THE

02:06:30.482 --> 02:06:33.752
RATIONALE WHEN A ACT IN AN WHEN

02:06:33.819 --> 02:06:35.955

DOES THE MONEY GO. JUNE SHORT

02:06:47.132 --> 02:06:50.336
THOSE THOSE- FINDS DID PRIMARILY

02:06:50.402 --> 02:06:53.806
GO BACK TO THE COUNTIES- FORWARD

02:06:53.872 --> 02:06:55.674
PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT. CIVIL

02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:57.443
PENALTIES SEVERAL ADMINISTRATIVE

CIVIL PENALTIES SO IN IN IN THIS

02:06:59.712 --> 02:07:01.613
NEW PROPOSAL DOES THAT STILL.

OPERATE THE SAME WAY. FOR THE

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:06.285

THAT ARE LIVING AT THE STATE

02:07:09.922 --> 02:07:10.990
LEVEL THERE IS SOME PROVISIONS

02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:13.058
TO. CONSIDER THOSE HEALTH IS

02:07:13.125 --> 02:07:15.894
BOTH GOING BACK TO THE COUNTY AS

WELL AS TO THE STATE. AND DO YOU

02:07:17.463 --> 02:07:19.198
HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT THE

02:07:19.264 --> 02:07:20.299
BREAKDOWN IS HOW MUCH GOES TO

02:07:20.366 --> 02:07:21.400
THE COUNTY HOW MUCH OF THE

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:23.602
STATE. NOT AT THIS TIME BUT I

COMMENTS YES THANK YOU MISTER

02:16:53.438 --> 02:16:54.606
CHAIRMAN BIRDS ROSS BROWN WITH

02:16:54.673 --> 02:16:56.474
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

02:16:56.541 --> 02:16:58.443
SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE

02:16:58.510 --> 02:17:00.779
LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL

02:17:00.845 --> 02:17:02.514
TO ACCELERATE THE FUNDING-

02:17:02.581 --> 02:17:04.249
BECAUSE IN OUR VIEW THE BENEFITS

02:17:04.316 --> 02:17:07.519
OF DOING SO ARE UNCLEAR AND-

02:17:07.586 --> 02:17:09.454
THAT COULD HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS

02:17:09.521 --> 02:17:11.323
ON FUTURE BUDGET FLEXIBILITY NO

02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:13.124
I'M GOING TO KIND OF RUN THROUGH

02:17:13.191 --> 02:17:14.225
ALL OF THOSE PIECES REAL

02:17:14.292 --> 02:17:15.393
QUICKLY. THE FIRST ON THE

02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:17.362
BENEFIT SIDE WE THINK THAT THE

02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:19.497
BENEFITS OF THE ACCELERATOR ON

02:17:19.564 --> 02:17:20.465
CLEARER- JUST TO KIND OF

02:17:20.532 --> 02:17:21.533
REITERATE I THINK SOMETHING YOU

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:23.902
ALREADY HEARD AND AS I'M SURE

02:17:23.969 --> 02:17:25.003
YOU REMEMBER THE GOVERNOR AS

02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:26.304
PART OF THIS YEAR JANUARY BUDGET

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:28.106
PROPOSED A TEN BILLION DOLLARS

02:17:28.173 --> 02:17:29.341
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FUNDING

02:17:29.407 --> 02:17:30.709
PACKAGE WHICH INCLUDED FUNDING

02:17:30.775 --> 02:17:32.510
THAT WAS AGREED UPON LAST YEAR

02:17:32.577 --> 02:17:34.179
AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING

02:17:34.245 --> 02:17:36.948
THAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET.

02:17:37.015 --> 02:17:39.751
IN JANUARY AND THAT WOULD A BID

02:17:39.818 --> 02:17:41.453
BY. I LEVELS OF FUNDING FOR LOT

02:17:41.519 --> 02:17:43.388
OF THESE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE.

02:17:43.455 --> 02:17:44.522
AND THE FUNNY WOULD BE SPREAD

02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:46.758
OUT OVER A MULTI YEAR A FIVE

02:17:46.825 --> 02:17:48.593
YEAR PERIOD REALLY- THIS

02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:50.195
PROPOSAL WOULD ACCELERATE A

02:17:50.261 --> 02:17:51.630
PORTION OF THAT FUNDING ONE

02:17:51.696 --> 02:17:53.365
POINT SEVEN BILLION- INTO THE

02:17:53.431 --> 02:17:57.102
CURRENT YEAR- WE THINK THAT- IF

02:17:57.168 --> 02:17:58.503
ACCELERATED IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER

02:17:58.570 --> 02:18:01.539
THERE IS. SUFFICIENT DEMAND FOR

02:18:01.606 --> 02:18:02.574
AND OF ALL THE ADDITIONAL

02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:04.909
FUNDING. IN THE NEAR TERM AND OR

02:18:04.976 --> 02:18:06.411
ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY TO

02:18:06.478 --> 02:18:08.179
IMPLEMENT. THE PROJECTS MORE

02:18:08.246 --> 02:18:09.681
QUICKLY THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE

02:18:09.748 --> 02:18:10.548
OTHERWISE OCCURRED UNDER KIND OF

02:18:10.615 --> 02:18:12.417
A MULTI YEAR FUNDING APPROACH.

02:18:12.484 --> 02:18:13.785
AND SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION

02:18:13.852 --> 02:18:15.654
HASN'T PROVIDED ANY SPECIFIC

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:16.955
ESTIMATES OF HOW THE PROPOSAL

02:18:17.022 --> 02:18:18.757
WOULD ACTUALLY SORT OF SPEED UP

02:18:18.823 --> 02:18:20.425
THE DEPLOYMENT OF. OF PROJECTS

02:18:20.492 --> 02:18:23.595
WITH R. P. TRUCKING STATIONS OR

02:18:23.662 --> 02:18:24.929
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT

02:18:24.996 --> 02:18:26.264
. SO ON THE SO THAT'S KIND OF ON

02:18:26.331 --> 02:18:28.433
THE BENEFIT SIDE ON IN TERMS OF

02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:30.068
KIND OF SOME OF THE POTENTIAL

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:31.302
ADVERSE EFFECTS WE THINK THAT

02:18:31.369 --> 02:18:32.504
THE PROPOSAL REDUCES SOME OF THE

02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:33.104
LEGISLATURE'S FLEXIBILITY TO

02:18:33.171 --> 02:18:34.539
ADJUST. FUTURE BUDGET

02:18:34.606 --> 02:18:36.141
ALLOCATIONS IN RESPONSE TO

02:18:36.207 --> 02:18:38.209
UNEXPECTED BUDGETARY AND POLICY

02:18:38.276 --> 02:18:40.545
CHANGES. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF

02:18:40.612 --> 02:18:42.147
GENERAL FUND REVENUES DECREASED

02:18:42.213 --> 02:18:44.315
DUE TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. IN

02:18:44.382 --> 02:18:45.650
THE COMING YEARS THE LEGISLATURE

02:18:45.717 --> 02:18:46.751
WOULD NO LONGER HAVE THE

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:49.054
FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND BY.

02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:50.655
ADJUSTING SOME OF THESE- THAT

02:18:50.722 --> 02:18:52.857
SPENDING. LEVELS IN FUTURE

02:18:52.924 --> 02:18:54.926
BUDGETS- ALSO IF THERE'S AN

02:18:54.993 --> 02:18:56.628
INCREASE IN SAID FUNDING FROM

02:18:56.695 --> 02:18:58.430
OTHER SOURCES FOR EXAMPLE

02:18:58.496 --> 02:18:59.664
FEDERAL FUNDING FOR. SOME OF THE

02:18:59.731 --> 02:19:00.965
SIMILAR THAT ACTIVITIES THE

02:19:01.032 --> 02:19:03.168
LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE. A SEAT

02:19:03.234 --> 02:19:05.303
AT ITS ABILITY TO ADJUST IT'S A

02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:09.207
- PRIORITIES AND RESPONSES. HIS

02:19:09.274 --> 02:19:10.375
SECONDLY YOU WE THINK THE

02:19:10.442 --> 02:19:12.010
PROPOSAL REDUCE LEGISLATORS

02:19:12.077 --> 02:19:13.044
ABILITY TO EXERCISE ITS

02:19:13.111 --> 02:19:15.447
OVERSIGHT ROLE SO FOR EXAMPLE.

02:19:15.513 --> 02:19:16.948
UNDER THE ORIGINAL MULTI YEAR

02:19:17.015 --> 02:19:19.117
APPROACH THAT WAS PROPOSED. IF

02:19:19.184 --> 02:19:20.351
FUTURE OVERSIGHT EFFORTS

02:19:20.418 --> 02:19:21.453
DETERMINED THAT DEPARTMENTS

02:19:21.519 --> 02:19:23.188
AREN'T IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS

02:19:23.254 --> 02:19:24.689
AFFECTED WITH THE LEGISLATURE

02:19:24.756 --> 02:19:26.725
COULD WITHHOLD FUNDING UNTIL THE

02:19:26.791 --> 02:19:28.393
ADMINISTRATION CAN SHOW THAT IT

02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:30.428
HAS MADE IMPROVEMENTS- HOWEVER

02:19:30.495 --> 02:19:32.363
UNDER THIS KIND OF ACCELERATION

02:19:32.430 --> 02:19:33.164
PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

02:19:33.231 --> 02:19:34.499
FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO EMPLOY

02:19:34.566 --> 02:19:36.668
THOSE. THOSE OVERSIGHT TOOLS IN

02:19:36.735 --> 02:19:38.870
THE FUTURE. FURTHERMORE SOME OF

02:19:38.937 --> 02:19:39.671
THE PUBLIC CONTRACTING

02:19:39.738 --> 02:19:41.573
EXEMPTIONS PROPOSED BY THE

02:19:41.639 --> 02:19:42.874
ADMINISTRATION WOULD REDUCE

02:19:42.941 --> 02:19:44.075
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIRD PARTY

02:19:44.142 --> 02:19:46.578
OVERSIGHT. FROM DDS- THAT ARE

02:19:46.644 --> 02:19:48.246
MEANT TO ENSURE THE STATE FUNDS

02:19:48.313 --> 02:19:49.848
ARE. ARE BEING SPENT

02:19:49.914 --> 02:19:51.816
RESPONSIBLY. SO JUST TO WRAP UP

02:19:51.883 --> 02:19:53.218
GIVEN SOME OF THE UNCLEAR

02:19:53.284 --> 02:19:54.686
BENEFITS AND SOME OF THE ADVERSE

02:19:54.753 --> 02:19:55.987
EFFECTS ON A BUDGET FLEXIBILITY

02:19:56.054 --> 02:19:58.022
IN OVERSIGHT WERE. I RECOMMEND

02:19:58.089 --> 02:20:01.760
THE LEGISLATURE REJECTED SPUR.

02:20:01.826 --> 02:20:05.663
THANK YOU- YOUR TAKE A STAB AT-

02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:07.532
RESPOND AS SOME OF THOSE-

02:20:07.599 --> 02:20:09.667
CRITICS SIDE ABSOLUTELY I'LL

02:20:09.734 --> 02:20:12.537
TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES AT

02:20:12.604 --> 02:20:13.705
THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS SOME

02:20:13.772 --> 02:20:15.640
OF THOSE CONCERNS. I WILL NOT

02:20:15.707 --> 02:20:17.642
SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE

02:20:17.709 --> 02:20:18.143
ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET

02:20:18.209 --> 02:20:20.378
PRIORITIES BUT I CAN'T SAY THESE

02:20:20.445 --> 02:20:21.112
PROGRAMS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL

02:20:21.179 --> 02:20:23.915
AMOUNT SO WHEN IT COMES TO YOU

02:20:23.982 --> 02:20:24.816
CAN THIS FUNDS TO BE SPENT. THAT

02:20:24.883 --> 02:20:26.951
I CAN ATTEST TO I'M IN BOTH THE

02:20:27.018 --> 02:20:28.520
CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM AND THE

02:20:28.586 --> 02:20:30.221
ABILITY OPTIONS PROGRAMS WE'VE

02:20:30.288 --> 02:20:31.623
REGULARLY SEEN DEMANDS WELL

02:20:31.689 --> 02:20:34.325
EXCEEDING SUPPLY- WHICH CAUSES

02:20:34.392 --> 02:20:36.127
THE SERVICE START STOP. AFFECT

02:20:36.194 --> 02:20:38.563
IN THE PROGRAM. IT ALSO MAKES IT

02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:39.831
HARDER TO PLAN FOR LONG TERM

02:20:39.898 --> 02:20:41.399
PERMANENT PLANTATION ONE EXAMPLE

02:20:41.466 --> 02:20:43.001
OF THIS IS THE FINANCING

02:20:43.067 --> 02:20:44.369
PROGRAM. WHERE WE CONSISTENTLY

02:20:44.435 --> 02:20:46.070

02:20:46.137 --> 02:20:47.806
THE VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF

02:20:47.872 --> 02:20:48.506

PROGRAMS PROPOSED FOR PATIENTS.

02:25:15.139 --> 02:25:16.874

HAS BEEN SLOWED BY THE PANDEMIC

02:25:33.057 --> 02:25:33.491
I THINK THAT' PROBABLY

02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:34.692
REPRESENTATIVE CONSIDERING

02:25:34.759 --> 02:25:37.061

COMING IN. OR SLIGHTLY DOWN. I'M

02:25:55.847 --> 02:25:57.315
TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT-

ENCUMBERED. HOW MUCH IS ALREADY

02:26:06.691 --> 02:26:07.458

DEMAND. IN ALL THESE PROGRAMS

02:26:09.293 --> 02:26:11.929
GOING FORWARD AS WE SEE THIS

02:26:11.996 --> 02:26:12.497
RELEASED SHARP PIVOT TOWARD

02:26:12.563 --> 02:26:14.966
ELECTRIFICATION- MEANING THAT.

02:26:15.032 --> 02:26:17.068
AS THE STATE MOVES INTO THAT

02:26:17.135 --> 02:26:19.070
AREA. WITH RIGOR. ASSEMBLY

02:26:19.137 --> 02:26:20.304
MEMBER BENNETT'S POINTS WITH

02:26:20.371 --> 02:26:21.606
CONSIDERABLE AUDIT AND COMPARE

02:26:21.672 --> 02:26:23.441
EDUCATION. WE ARE AWARE THAT

02:26:23.508 --> 02:26:24.609
THERE ARE LARGE NUMBER OF MIDDLE

02:26:24.675 --> 02:26:26.244
CLASS AND LOW INCOME SOUTH

02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:27.645
KOREANS WHO NEED THESE TOOLS.

02:26:27.712 --> 02:26:29.380
SOME OF THESE AREAS WE DO SEE

02:26:29.447 --> 02:26:31.382
STRONG DEMAND. EXACTLY HOW THAT

02:26:31.449 --> 02:26:34.919
THE BAND PLAYED OUT OF COURSE IS

02:26:34.986 --> 02:26:36.387
SUBJECT TO WHERE THE MARKET

02:26:36.454 --> 02:26:39.457
GOES. SO IS SO ARE YOU SAYING

02:26:39.524 --> 02:26:42.260
THAT LA WAS WRONG. NO I AM NOT

02:26:42.326 --> 02:26:43.027
SPEAKING VALUES PARTICULAR

02:26:43.094 --> 02:26:44.662
CRITIQUES I AM SAYING THAT THE

02:26:44.729 --> 02:26:47.498
STRONG DEMAND FOR THESE PROGRAMS

02:26:47.565 --> 02:26:49.600
. OKAY WELL I MEAN WE'RE I'M

02:26:49.667 --> 02:26:51.169
TRYING I GUESS MAYBE TO THE L.

02:26:51.235 --> 02:26:53.137
A. I'M TRYING TO WAY. TO MEET

02:26:53.204 --> 02:26:55.106
WITH FROM YOUR ANALYSIS EVEN A

02:26:55.173 --> 02:26:57.775
KID THAT- THAT THERE REALLY IS

02:26:57.842 --> 02:26:59.410
NO ESTIMATES AT THE MOMENT OF

02:26:59.477 --> 02:27:00.344
HOW THE EXHILARATED FUNDING

02:27:00.411 --> 02:27:01.546
WOULD CHANGE THE TIME LINES FOR

02:27:01.612 --> 02:27:03.214
KEY PROGRAM OUTCOMES. I MADE

02:27:03.281 --> 02:27:05.483
WHAT WHAT WHAT DETAILS WHAT

02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:07.185
NUMBERS ARE YOU UTILIZING A YOUR

02:27:07.251 --> 02:27:09.620
NUMBERS ALIGNING. YEAH AND SO I

02:27:09.687 --> 02:27:11.889
THINK OUR COMMENTS WERE. ALONG

02:27:11.956 --> 02:27:13.958
THE LINES OF THAT IT WAS UNCLEAR

02:27:14.025 --> 02:27:15.359
AT THE TIME THAT WE DID OUR

02:27:15.426 --> 02:27:17.161
ANALYSIS AND- WE DIDN'T HAVE THE

02:27:17.228 --> 02:27:18.729
NUMBERS THAT WERE JUST PRESENTED

02:27:18.796 --> 02:27:20.464
RIGHT HERE IN THE HEARING AND SO

02:27:20.531 --> 02:27:22.233
I THINK HAVING THAT INFORMATION.

02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:23.935
COULD HELP SORT OF CLARIFY AND

02:27:24.001 --> 02:27:25.336
PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

02:27:25.403 --> 02:27:27.238
AROUND WHAT THOSE BENEFITS.

02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:30.074
MIGHT BE AMENABLE NOTES- AGAIN

02:27:30.141 --> 02:27:31.576
SORT OF THE A FUNDING FROM PRIOR

02:27:31.642 --> 02:27:33.444
YEARS IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT

02:27:33.511 --> 02:27:34.445
WOULD HAVE KIND OF BEEN PROPOSED

02:27:34.512 --> 02:27:36.581
GOING FORWARD GIVEN SOME OF THE

02:27:36.647 --> 02:27:38.015
