right we're gonna start momentarily we're just waiting for two more members so we can begin with a quorum and then we can move forward from that point so when for two members this is the other person Mayes hi I'm texting chat right now okay Cristina Garcia Gloria of you want to start will well like we have it would have to bring we'll probably have to just to the rules there was another yeah yeah if we can guess whenever yeah yeah afternoon I we're going to begin with -- our utility energy committee -- hearing variety of topics but basically focusing on the the evolution in metamorphosis is taking place in the energy sector while maintaining reliability -- and affordability on the road to the carbonization -- it was my hope that we would have a quorum at the beginning so we can improve our -- our rules for this -- this committee about will probably gonna have to do that in another time because I know we also have members who are here who will have to appear in other committees and so -- we're going to begin with this hearing a give them the opportunity to participate at various times along the way -- that will allow them to -- to drop back and so -- in respect for their time we're going to begin let me just say again thank you for for being here this is -- informational hearing will examine as I said before the metamorphosis of the energy sector of foundational to successfully achieving our environmental mandates is keeping energy affordable and reliable we know from the energy crisis that those critical foundations were compromised in response to the energy crisis the legislature mandated the California public utilities commission to establish a regulatory program a paradigm which mandates that entities under the C. P. UC's jurisdiction which mandates that entities under their jurisdiction maintain sufficient power resources to reliably Sir the man that regulatory paradigm is fundamental to the well being of the energy sector this hearing will discuss the recent improvements to the resource adequacy explore the deficiencies in other areas of concern this hearing is being held prior to legislation being heard him this committee so that led just say there's can better understand the immediate and growing needs of the electric system at all levels of the system there are a growing number of entities assuming the responsibility to procure energy to serve the dim energy demand of their communities each one of those entities is playing a vital role in maintaining the well being of the complex energy infrastructure much like a car engine each component is vital to the car's performance I'm convinced that by working together we can address the challenges before us and to continue to demonstrate to the world the California is a showcase for how to reliably and affordably the carbonized our energy infrastructure we have two panels that will be presenting to us today and give us an opportunity to hear their presentation and the question each of these individuals so let me call if I could the first panel forward to join us overview on the changing needs of the energy system of would like to call for Michael picker president of California public utilities commission Dr Austin brown executive director of the university of California at Davis policy institute for energy environment and the economy mark Ross letter vice president of renewable integrations and market quality for the California independent system operator to have a quorum one more and -- morning I Michael Victor this big run about now hi better okay great slow hard to tell from here I'm a kick off and talk a little bit about our examination of on the changes that we're seeing in the electric industry in California how their reflects on our ability meet our clean energy goals reliability elements of what it is that we need to do I'll just start out by saying that three years ago I used to go to to the legislative hearings like this conferences the small meetings where we are talking about the death spiral of the electric utilities due to the net energy -- meter group of fine roof top solar and so currently the utilities are still here although there are a lot of stress but two of the largest to than that companies who actually -- sold into the net energy metered market are gone south solar city and son Addison so what I'm gonna try to do is spend about ten minutes just odd brawling broad perspectives and trends as opposed to focusing on any one particular element that it was important to remind ourselves that utilities electric utilities have not nineteen ninety eight at legislative direction as a picker if I could -- we've got a quorum now so we're going to of visually open the meeting with the roll call Holden present Patterson here Burke Carillo Chen Cunningham Eggman Cristina Garcia Eduardo Garcia Mayes more Muratsuchi -- sissy Jerry quirk here Reyes Thiago teen Hey we have a quorum is there a motion to adopt them thank you there's with enthusiasm thank you -- roll call on the motion to adopt the committee rules for this year Holden hi Holden aye Patterson Patterson hi Burke Carillo I Chen Cunningham Eggman Eggman I Cristina Garcia Garcia I Eduardo Garcia I Mayes Muratsuchi quirk aye quirk aye Reyes he is I San Diego teen okay they are a rules just ended up to thank you members present picker please continue Sir I was just say this is just commenting that the that the legislature actually for a bed the electric utilities to own new electric generation after about nineteen ninety eight -- they do that through contracting into kind of a complicated bilateral market the drives the price down and gets the best project based on least cost best fit for the needs different universe these days in a variety of other ways and so the changes taking place on two axes one is technology and the other is business models and so there's opportunity for customers to make choices based on business models as well as making choices about technologies they will use on their own out that most of the discussion really takes place on the generation side because it's full of all kinds of cool things like battery storage and and rooftop solar but in reality the most important choice and the most important opportunity for customers to take control has been in terms of energy efficiency and other demand side opportunities and I'll get back to that in just a second but the other pieces that energy itself has just become a commodity and and the services that people used to be able to manage their use of electricity is becoming increasingly valuable so let's to examine some of the technologies that are actually taking more and more place in the marketplace energy efficiency again it's reducing demand for electricity through building an appliance standards probably the most significant source -- changing the building envelope through insulation we're starting to see new technologies come into play that actually swap one fuel for another -- grandma geothermal for heating and cooling and homes is new homes it's as cheap as hot water heaters and gas furnaces and it is cleaner the industrial and and a large commercial sector very important to actually meeting our energy needs early and -- the seventies eighties and and continues to be an important part this came about as a result of federal program called purpose -- I won't go into the act in them but it actually required that if you could get a a license to operate one of these cho Chen facilities and the utility had to take the contract it was very very very -- affected point to the fact that Amazon and Google for example -- at Hey I can actually buy their own Nguyen plants they can buy their own solar plants sometimes in the desert sometimes even out of state they pay a price to send their electrons over the wires to their facilities and all over the state of California that's about three gigawatts of electricity it shows up in most of our over view of electricity use as actually being a reduction because it's new goes away from those regulated utilities rooftop solar that's about five to maybe six gigawatts of power again it looks a little bit like energy efficiency this is could be considered to be a business model since most of that was built through a financial engineering product than an energy metering -- though it's fairly complicated but it involves getting a lot of people to sign up for lease the solar panels is actually the companies like sun at its centre solar city or son run they then sell those leases into the secondary market so I mean you have to find customers have high fight go scores of the fuel cell batteries this is sort of a it's a choice of people who want to pay more but reliability so it's really applicables and not people who have online sales -- crate and barrel for example if you miss the the Easter process you sales market if you miss the Christmas mark sell it at seventy percent your sales cross year she'll pay extra to make sure that your servers have electricity on those on those weeks -- business models sec so just to to mention as of September two thousand eighteen rather than having three electricity providers we have thirty seven what we call load serving entities under P. R. C. jurisdiction that doesn't include the publicly owned utilities -- that's three I -- use nineteen CC ace and fourteen electric city service service providers their important and I'll come back to them in a second there's additional business model called pace property assessed clean energy loans that is used for people who who want to buy a rooftop solar array in on it or sometimes it's used as a way to help finance those nam projects and and did spews for energy efficiency it's usually sold door to door or in other kind of high volume sales tactics -- the recently the consumer product and have established by -- Dodd Frank after the the collapse of the housing market due to toxic loans decided they needed to step in because a predatory marketing of these prayer pace loans to people who actually couldn't afford them and couldn't pay them based on the energy that they saved direct access that's rob was was the original -- deregulated market of two thousand two thousand one when -- we we had a number of failures there and day a lot of predatory tactics by people were supplying some of these electricity service providers the legislature chose to re regulate and made several important reforms but there are a number of people who continue to serve that market the legislature cap that it fourteen percent of all the customer usable actress city in the state of California it's mostly in the commercial and industrial sector -- still very important to the -- is one of the things he keeps prices competitive for for manufacturing in other high energy intensive but it light they like it to grow senator Hertzberg carried a bill that would have lifted the cap completely he agreed to allow a more orderly progression and -- it's now it's seventeen percent and and then -- he's asked us to come back with the planned for two in twenty twenty to lift the cap completely so there's a traditional utilities like the investor owned utilities and the publicly owned utilities the irrigation districts and and are a we used to be vertically integrated which meant that they own the generation the Senate to the customers over the wires and transmission the day on and then they -- they had a service area that they completely controlled nobody else was allowed to compete with them there as you can see that's change more recently we've seen the growth of the clean the community aggregators -- their authorized in two thousand three Marin clean energy actually started up in two thousand one there now flashing attention to them but as you can see there's a wide range of different -- business models and technology that are all starting to move into a competition with our traditional providers so here's a kind of where we get into our uncharted and potentially dangerous territory where neither here nor there we stepped away from that model that the legislature sent us back to after two thousand and one but slowly over time market share has moved away and we have a lot of different providers who are regulated in different ways if you know the act the cleanest way would be if we had vertically integrated utilities or we went to fall competition where everybody picked erect lecture city provider and then you had discrete transmission and the street distribution companies that's what Texas in New York do it works for them not clear if it work for here but it's also clear we're not going to go back to a vertically integrated system so the question is what do you do and I just got tired a bit about out some of the challenges that we're seeing so reaching our clean energy goals the the clip of the CCA's two gigawatts of growth from two thousand to the gate -- to to eight today during that same period the investor owned utilities built -- something like twenty gigawatts of power so there's some value to having that central Lusatian on that scale SB three fifty requires all of the load serving entities within their C. C. A.'s electricity service providers for investor owned utilities to happily sixty five percent of their our PS eligible contract procurement from contracts that are ten years or longer they have to do that by twenty twenty one that's a real challenge for some of these the the providers like the CCA's in the S. P.'s so based on -- just use some information it was more of readily available to us based on the CCA's renewable that short calculations and that was presented to us in our -- in our to October thirtieth two thousand eighteen our PS report the CCA's will have an immediate C. R. renewable portfolio procurement need of about six thousand nine hundred in twenty twenty the current load forecasts -- indicate their overall need would be about sixteen thousand gigawatt hours and twenty twenty that's that's a step up in a talk a little bit in terms of just the peak capacity of what they've been able to picture so again they stay indicate to us they are two gigawatts of renewable energy projects that are on development or already built to serve load by twenty twenty that's a list of about fifty six projects that the total two thousand one hundred and thirteen megawatts we don't know if all those projects will be constructed my experience with with the large projects that I worked on between two thousand and eight and two thousand fourteen before I came to the P. you say is it takes a lot are you we were successful in getting over over a hundred and fifty large projects over a hundred and megawatts and it was -- it was a complex task to permit interconnecting in and help them seek financing so I just will say it I think it's going to be a challenge the average project size of the the the projects that currently are indicated by CCA's as to be under contract is about forty megawatts but the median size that means half of them are are are are small our small because this size or smaller is about a hundred and seventy five megawatts so at that media projects sides of the CCA's would need to procure more than five thousand seven hundred additional projects to add a total of ten gigabytes to California's electrical grids which is a challenge the challenge that's two orders of magnitude larger than what they've done so far fifty six projects Hannah and that that will that will that will be a challenge it's made a little more difficult because my many of them may have customers but they don't have experience they don't -- assets so it's hard to establish a ballot she and to get financing from many of the normal sources now I'm I'm just using them as an example because we had better information on the projects electricity surprise service providers have some of the same problems but they're usually this many of the successful yes peas not all are actually out of state utilities who own a lot of generation and what they do is they sell some of their excess power into the California market through these electricity service provider contracts they are not bound by geography that their opt in which means a customer has to choose them versus the CCA's which are opt out so kinds of problems I'll just the they have real it relatively challenges as well subsidies different topic so all both net net energy majors solar CCA's and electricity service providers don't pay their full share of the fixed costs to the system and this is a problem that we've been struggling to deal with than a couple of different settings we're making progress in the the P. C. I. A. we have more to go it's a very controversial project at one point many of the parties wanted this to move very quickly but as they got into it all of the said they wanted this to take more time because they really had a lot that they wanted to discuss were losing this market scale that I described before that was helpful to getting that hundred and fifty are projects of a hundred megawatts a larger -- it's just specially going to be a challenge and new technologies like battery storage you want to reach -- scale the people can do a lot of good innovative small projects but not many of them if you really want to scale quickly then you want to have large a large companies with big balance sheets to be able to move a quickly liability I know that mark Crossley or probably speak a little bit to this but just will quickly up until last year we maybe had two requests for waivers from our resource adequacy requirements this is a fundamental requirement of the California legislature after the the the energy crisis to two thousand two thousand one it says that you must have under contract and available as much electricity as you'll need for that biggest day of service of your customers in the year so two waivers where people couldn't get it for one reason or another last year we had eleven waivers mostly CCA's and and E. S. P. S. this year we expect to have another eleven it's tough because when you get into a small geographic area and your serving customers there there may not be enough transmission to bring power in from outside on those big peak days so you need to have a contract with some generation that's within that load pocket and if you can't get that because you don't have the ability to compete for a contract because you don't have a big enough ballot she you're asking us for a waiver ice consider that to be a weakness in the design I think it's a big problem we are currently working on that we've required rather than one year contract because of the changes in whose actually serving electricity we're now requiring three year contract that may make it easier for people to get contracts with some of those generators we don't know if that fails to materialize by the end of the summer we may actually impose a Central buyer and there's currently a legislative proposal to do that as well so I just say that this is one of the things that scares me you may be a small company but your failure to provide electricity your customers can cause a brown out they can escalate in it can actually affect customers in somebody else's service area so it's it's it's it's a challenge I think we need to develop a backstop for business failures we've seen it happen before in two thousand two thousand one we saw in San Diego a small electricity service provider who was operating in the deregulated environment similar to what some of the new providers are doing and they had didn't have that resource adequacy they were in a tight market the whole west was really hot for a two week period all of the access electricity was going at premium prices this is even before we started to detect the gaming and this company had not put enough money aside to be able to buy all the electricity they need they were hemorrhaging cash they went bankrupt two hundred fifty thousand customers were dumped in the lap of -- of the incumbent electric utility who had not counted on having a quarter million customers show up and say we need electricity so all of a sudden day were paying a premium price for the failure of this other company so we need a backstops to prevent that from happening again customer protections I talked a little bad about predatory marketing in the pace market we have lots of indications that happens in the nam -- around we need to talk a little bit about what's the pathway of these processes continue for the regulated utilities to get rid of some of their fixed costs public goods program what happens to them so all of the care programs and other Ste I'll just say that we looked a lot about this era I think you all got copies of our two reports the first is actually our study of four different markets where they've tried these different models to see what worked and what didn't work how they dealt with this provider of last resort for the customers who might get dumped how they dealt with reliability and then here's our plan going for now say that that I'm in I am very honored but the legislators of started to write bills out of this to actually address some of the weaknesses that we've detected I think that's helpful I can't take a position on him yeah because they're still doing the fiscal analysis to share with the department of finance without which were not allowed to take a position but -- I'm confident that the legislature is starting to see some of the same risks that we are starting to move forward so I'll be happy to take your questions perhaps after the other two -- gentleman of presented thank you brother picker questions after the next two presenters and -- Austin brown mark eight then thank you Mister chairman and and thank you to the committee for having here today -- a to talk about this is -- issue of utmost urgency right were utterly reliant on a reliable electric grid -- and yet facing some pretty amazing a new challenges were asking that great to accomplish for us -- so I think it's it's a really timely issuance really privilege to be here thank you -- my name is Austin brown I direct the UC Davis policy institute for energy environment economy -- we attempt to help make the current research that's out there available to -- exactly that's what the people in this room our making research informed decisions affecting the future of our energy and transportation systems so I've tried to put together a few slides that contain some sort of -- background information if you're a visual person like me you might I might use those is the one that's got my name on the front -- -- if you're not a visual person then you can just listen I will try to cover the main points -- and if you're really in it for just the summary that the first slide after the title fight has the the big picture summary so I can go over that and then -- if that's all you want you can tune out -- or -- listen on and I'll try to go into a little bit more detail some of these other points -- every got one -- so so the summary which I'll try to list here is that California really is doing an amazing job of leading terms of clean energy goals we're reaching further in many ways than other states and really any other country -- -- on the planet and so far we've seen that are grade is generally up to the task -- and reliability is doing -- at least stable by most of our conventional metrics that just look at how many hours of time are we as the average customer losing to a blackout -- but other worries raised by researchers another's about potential brittleness in the system and because the grid and reliable across the supply is so critical -- that means that we need to be thinking in advance we can't wait for the system to break to understand that we need to fix that for challenges on within considerable overlap with present picker that'll hopefully let me to be more efficient with with covering them since they've already been discussed to some extent -- that are there facing the grade and some of these are of course also opportunities right none of these are are bad things are all really -- important features of our system they just could provide of new challenges the systems you go and the for the -- call out our integration of variable renewable energy so that's wind and solar photovoltaics -- the incorporation of new business models with specific focus on the -- impressive growth of of CCA's looking at incorporating electric vehicles into our great and with special notice to the kinds of benefits they could potentially provide to the grid and then the on the present challenge -- of climate change other were tempting to deal with from vacation perspective can also offers significan adaptation challenges to the great is the over arching question which will just begin to touch on is and how high can clean energy immigration go with our current grade and what those integration options are to help us do more I'm so next line I have a map -- of from the Lawrence Berkley lab of the current renewable portfolio standards and just to make the point that a states have been key drivers of clean energy policy and none more so than California and that doesn't even include a hundred percent clean energy goal -- by twenty forty five -- that that's now it really that the big target in the electricity sector on to California's been a big leader there the state policies have really helped get renewables and other clean energy sources I'm to the place that they are -- where they are today what we would face as we move towards ultra high levels of variable renewable energy and this comes from a national renewable energy lab report -- I should have actually tried to avoid using any a public utility commission or I SO charts and reports year that's not because I don't think that's important as to want to try to tell my colleagues -- what what their own reports say so I really try to focus on national lab in university -- university sources here so this is from a national energy lab study and each dot on this chart is a essentially a grid and it's craft on the X. axis but system size the bigger grades are to the right of that chart and then on the Y. axis the percentage of wind and solar and so you see is that so far it's only relatively small grids on the scale of a single city or single island but we might think of as a big microcredit that have been able to incorporate very high levels of renewable energy and they're usually because they don't have a larger great as an option we had to see some countries like Denmark and Ireland right in the middle there that have started to incorporate relatively high levels -- and then we see California since this report we've moved up that access is we've added more wind and solar was that immigration options work right now to get up to around the twenty five percent of variable renewable energy but getting beyond that to the sorts of fifty percent -- of variable renewable energy that we would need to to accomplish our clean energy goals will require new policies and new efforts that the great as it's currently designed today would find it challenging to incorporate renewals up to that level we also see that report not shown here that diversity is incredibly important so you can't rely on only one source you want complement resources both by type of rules by type of energy generation -- and then also by geography so that we integrate -- energy resources from a wider variety it's much less likely that the wind will not be blowing in multiple places at once and the bigger of an area you can integrate the more you're able to mitigate that challenge on the next new challenge facing electric grid that I want to highlight mentioned we see a really dramatic gross in community choice on the map shown shows the sort of current status of the different community -- choice programs and -- their dramatic growth and then the right side shows up from -- UCLA report -- shows that by and large these programs have higher levels of clean renewable energy then the -- the utility sources that they are replacing as a generation source so this is provided a lot of value to customers and they've often able to source new generation it at relatively low prices not done carefully dissociate the sourcing of power from the planning process and can create new challenges in terms of ensuring reliability I think of him more about that on the second panel on the third trend which is maybe one that could provide a lot of benefits if -- if integrated with smart policy in good research based approach is the transition towards electric vehicles so independent of our religious the goals California has very strong policies -- developing new markets for lectured vehicles right now the vast majorities vehicles are just plugged in whenever it's convenient for the driver of that vehicle but it's -- entirely chief both technically to make those vehicles charge whenever the greed has surplus capacity to do so so this is a graph shown from a demonstration project -- with about a hundred vehicles between BMW M. P. Jeannie just an example tonight's you know small scale compared what we would need to be doing but you can see that these vehicles -- so the the the bottom a chart shows the solar power coming on during the daytime and then the Orange Line is when those vehicles are charging and so they're set to essentially charge when they're surplus solar available on the grid and it macroscale we know that before too long we're gonna have a surplus during the daytime of solar on most sunny days and it's already happened on a few days so if you could set up select vehicles are basically able to soak up that demand and potentially as a curse a couple of times in this a demonstration project tensely return some of that power to the grid in times when prices are high and demand is high and supply is less available so that's more integration of luck vehicles could be an enormous -- asset that can help manage excuse me I manage the future of the grid the last risk and -- the one that I think even if we act now for a very long time -- is the increasing risks that climate provides to the grid to essentially every single one of our -- energy supplies that can be made worse into a world of a changing climate supplies can actually make thermal generation from example for example natural gas less efficient -- and in some cases at the temperatures get to hide plants are then unable to operate -- warmer weather can also make transmission line sagging can lower efficiency supplies we actually seen that several times of the past years and increased drought -- potentially -- sustain drought due to climate change a could exacerbate that problem I'm changes in weather patterns like clouds and wind patterns could affect our ability to forecast the future of solar and wind -- and it would affect Cooley demand which is a in some cases the dominant -- energy demand at different times of day out and that's without even getting into wildfires which I think we'll have to leave for deferred discussion about which would expects to to increase dramatically in the the woman climate were CA so that provides this over arching the challenge that we're going to have to ask our great to be able to -- to handle all in the context of incorporating the new clean energy options we need to avoid making the climate challenge even worse as we go so the good news at the end is that there are many immigration options available energy transition in a measured and effective in research driven away I'm I won't go through all of them we tend to think of storage as the one that we would just want to incorporate but there's many options that are probably cheaper in most contexts so there's options in efficient system operation in the development of a new an efficient markets -- in managing load in some cases so there's a already examples of that industrial -- context but be able to expand that into other kinds of flexible load I'm having flexible generation available to meet unexpected demands -- improve networks and then incorporating storage where it makes the most sense in the grid so a research in forming part portfolio -- based approach is needed here and I really applaud the committee for taking on this issue that way thank you very much thank you for the opportunity for -- presenting this important topic -- my name is mark profit arm the vice president market quality and renewable integration of the California IRA so yes -- manages the high voltage power grid a and runs the wholesale market for about eighty percent of California be touching on three points -- and those point to built around our responsibility as bouncing area those responsibilities include balancing supply and demand on a second by second basis ensuring security of the system meaning we don't overload any lines and we are prepared for loss of a line or element without overloading the parallel line if we lose a resource we have to have sufficient reserve capability to ramp up in case we lose a resource at any given time and our last responsibility is around restoration if we have a major blackout and we have to restore the system do we have the resources and the capability to restore the system my comments today are largely focusing around the balancing responsibility and the challenges that are were facing in that area and forget jump into those three points I I kind of the equivalent Z. the challenge of changing a all four tires of your car while driving down a bumpy road at the same time and -- and all the tires are being purchased by not you the driver but multiple people out in the industry that are bringing you the tires so the point is that there's a timing issue there's a sequencing issue and to say the least the three points are gonna be touching on is is the fact that demand we have increased variable resources and we must dispatch other resources down or increased demand when we have a surplus of supply at the same time when those very well resources are not producing we need to be able to balance the system by your ramping up other resources during those times currently the second point is that the natural gas fleet is currently used and many of those times when we have to make up for that supply that's not delivered by very well resources lastly -- imports also make up to the -- -- supply when we are insufficient with a not very well resources and those times that were not insist were insufficient for resources are not infrequent okay and I'll get into that more as I discussed this all the factors point to a trend as we transition to a low carbon grid that I also may find meeting its demand when the renewable supply is not producing such as evenings are stormy day is becoming more and more difficult and therefore we'll all need to find innovative solutions that work together to reliably operate the grid I will expand upon these points and the innovative solutions that the we should consider at as a as I assembly is a must be considered to address these operational needs at a reasonable cost as the great continues to reduce reliance on emitting resources California has a diverse set of resource -- than resource mix in the mix is continuing to evolve the single most significant change over the last few years has been the rise of renewable energy currently the over the years we've we've got to the point where about one third of our demand is being met over the year by renewable resources but from the operator perspective we look at more ground yearly what is it happening on any given dot day or given our and what we've seen is that we've seen as much as more than seventy percent on a given our of the demand being met by actual renewable resources in fact we've had we've on may twenty six of last year we get the point where ninety three percent almost a hundred percent of our demand instantaneous the man was being met by carbon free resources if you include nuclear and -- hydro resources so we are being we're we're making success the last I want to make on this is that as we as a result we have actually reduced twenty two percent of but reduced carbon emissions from our dispatch relative to twenty fourteen levels by twenty two percent these numbers all indicate we are making significant progress towards meeting the state's climate goals and that Wilk need to continue to unfold opportunities including technological advances and pioneering policies to support the shift to a greener grid of the future but as we do so we all my we also must remain mindful of the growing operational challenge we are facing why will you why would we will continue to reduce our reliance in carbon emitting resources there will remain periods when solar and wind production falls off in the near term during such conditions will continue to rely on gas generating plants as well as imports to serve the demand and maintain reliability in the long term we will need to deploy other technologies and systems including things like storage or repurpose ceasing the gas generation fleet to use renewable gas in order to reduce the carbon footprint of maintaining reliability to achieve this fundamental transit transformation we will need careful consideration about sequencing timing technical capability and the cost of replacement alternatives to the gas fleet to ensure we maintain reliability during this transition why will you while we expect to have and be able to leverage periods when we have abundance of clean supply we must also be prepared to meet the demand when those cloudy days when those -- or when there's little solar production we observe on days with significant cloud cover like we've had experience recently across the state that soul resources can read can reduce reduce in production relative to their cat capacity to only ten percent or twenty percent of their installed capacity we have more than twelve thousand megawatts of resources now on the grid that's not including the behind the meters -- solar resources so in a lot since January of last year with that amount of capacity we have experience about twenty days when solar production actually fell below five thousand megawatts relative to its troll thousand megawatts capacity indeed on January fourteenth from January fourteenth January seventeenth of this year we actually saw the four consecutive days that the production was the maximum production for the day of the solar was as little as two thousand and as high as four thousand megawatts so that we can have sustained long periods of of lack of production from these renewable of variable resources I just spoke about the grid side on the behind a meter side we have about six thousand megawatts of the band now being met by behind the meter solar resources similarly when we have the cloud cover about eighty percent of that six thousand megawatts demand comebacks comes comes back on to the system and requires us to be able to serve that so if you consider the grid side and the behind a meter side between a cloudy day and a non cloudy day you can have as much as fourteen thousand megawatts swinging in terms of renewable production and when you do all that production doesn't exist or doesn't produce you have to make that up fourteen thousand megawatts of the Cuillin to about seven nuclear units of resources since twenty fourteen we have been discussing the change an operational conditions since then we've we've been watching in managing over supply in the middle of the day while the at the end of the day we managed that spike of demand that have to meet the evening ramp when the sun was setting the increase in these challenges hasn't come faster than we had expected because the successful adoption of solar generation in the Golden State we now are projecting that will need between fifteen and twenty thousand megawatts to be able to be ramps in over a three hour period as I pointed out in my beginning testimony the evening ramps currently being served by a combination of imports and gas resources as well as hydro what we've observed is that the reliance on imports is becoming more challenging there are increasing periods of time where the especially in during the highest low periods where there's a scarcity of supply outside the area because that generation is meeting the demand outside the area it may not be available so what we have thirteen thousand megawatts of import capacity wires in the air to support that we see like it last year during our peak conditions only three thousand megawatts of imports coming in so if we assume that there's going to be ten thousand megawatts we may be assuming in correctly the availability we need to secure that if we're going to rely upon the economic lastly the economics of the existing ghastly is changing the renewable energy production has brought holes whole sale energy prices down as well capacity payments are going toward a renewable resort resources as they well should be but that results in the fact that these gas resources are becoming more and more economically distressed because they're not being picked up through the resource adequacy and the revenues through the wholesaler you market -- insufficient yet as I previously discussed there are times when the system will need these resources to be available and if they start retiring in large numbers we will have those resources available so the continue down the path of reliable and affordable energy supply the I also recommends that the suite of solutions be deployed first diversify the resource fleet both geographically intent technologically at this is described earlier enable incentives for demand participation and increased energy efficiency so it's a responsive to the system conditions as these change leverage periods of abundance clean supply to de carbonized other sectors including the transportation heating and cooling sector promote energy storage on the system to capture abundant supply for use when the supply other support when that supply is scarce foster regional collaboration to share an insurer resource efficiency across the region ensure all resources including renewables are providing essential reliability services not just energy so that the search sufficient operation visibility and control those resources bill flexibility into all resources including the exist making the existing gas fleet more flexible and then lastly secure import capacity if you're gonna rely upon that so you ensure that's available when you need it using one of these alternate will not solve the challenges that we face we'll take a combination of these solutions to meet the reliability needs and I can't tell you how much of each at this point I think they'll be a a discussion about how to do it at the least cost diet so pledges to commit at pledges its commitment to work with you all as we plan and prepare for the future thank you very much thank you that I appreciate all three of you coming today in your presentation I just wanted to kind of laid off with two questions one -- to you -- Mister Ross letter and then -- Mister Baker one for you and then I'll turn to the members of obviously over though it your your presentation talk a little bit about obviously looking at grading greater efficiency for the grid and how of we can utilize resources more efficiently as we look at the intermittent periods of time when we have solar or wind -- and -- the last couple of years there's been the conversation around reach allies in the grad and now we're talking a bit about the -- resource of the energy imbalance market as maybe a way of growing into a more regional as approach can you talk a little bit about how the hi so is looking at of the strategy around and energy imbalance market and how that is going to be of structured in such a way to address some of the concerns and issues that you're sure outlined sure and I'll be brief the -- the motivation of the energy about the market was to enter our in trial were trading to occur if it was economically beneficial to occur it's helped with renewable immigration because it allows police when we have a surplus of supply it allows us to actually use that supply to dispatch other resources in the region down and then when we are in the evening and we need supply to come back in we actually can leverage and use the rest of the our neighbors to provide that supply it builds upon the fact that that supplies available it doesn't guarantee that that supplies available so it really works around the use of the available -- capability and so the point I want to make is that it doesn't address a making sure that sufficient supply to is is available nor does that ensure that the right commitment of resources is occurring on a day ahead basis some of these resources you have to make commitments because they take a long time to start and that's where we believe we can enhance and leverage the energy imbalance market and extended into our day ahead market and be able to make larger decisions commitment decisions day ahead doing so we think we'll have significant benefits com and leveraging eight and energy amounts market but that extension into their market does not address the longer term how do you plan the system both from a transmission perspective and and from a resource procurement perspective it doesn't enable that to occur -- there may be regional opportunities as are still left on the table far as the day had market thank you for that miss Parker -- back in February the commission -- did some reforms to the resource adequacy program and and in that program there was -- the -- June the central procurement you talk a little bit about it in your in your presentation if you're expecting a report to come back at the end of the year and it's gonna guests Dillon at how this would have -- be structured what which your assessment on the reality or the viability of having a detailed plan for center procurement authority in place by the end of the year well -- first there was very little agreement between all the parties as to whether we should have this a centralized procurement mechanism -- there was -- there some of folks who said bill maybe after we've gotten the easy stuff than there can be a residual fire to take care of the hard stuff come to grips with how you'd pay for it -- there are some people who favor a capacity market similar to the ones that we see in other states as opposed to a bilateral buyer similar to the way that we care -- lecture city contracts so that service is waiting to see if people can develop their thinking a little bit better if there's consensus what people did agree on is it would probably allow on some of the smaller players who have a hard time in really rough and tumble competitive electricity markets to be able to get contracts if they bought three years ahead they might be able to tell a a I operator of a power plant look it's not going to be year to year we're going to give you a three year contract are you willing to deal with this now so that's worth where we left the decision were asking people to come back and tell us what is the best solution to trying to make sure that there's some way to fill in the blanks for all these new entities that are entering the market place you can't obtain market they can't can't obtain the all the reliability that they need in the market place so again because it's still a process I can't tell you in that I have an opinion until all the evidence is in but the at sign commissioner tells us that we should have a decision by October but I don't a I don't see that we can we can avoid having some way to fill in those weak spots again we there's no one solution for all these different business models and all these different ways people are by and technology that everybody will agree on and so we're trying to be as a gnostic as we can about CCAC the espys in direct access about whether people self generate but we know that we have to keep the great hall and we know that a large series of large three large central per cures have made it work that may be that what we need to do some form of that for everybody who can't make it work and they're just gonna have to pay thank you any questions from members structure thank you Dodd I'm gonna try to be brief Mister chairman side but this we are twenty years into the twenty first century state of California is the fifth largest economy on the planet and we are literally sitting here today talking about a grid that is significantly on reliable Mr rustler I want to ask a little bit about that to have eighty percent of the electricity in the state of California managing yes fifteen thousand to twenty thousand megawatts is necessary to rapidly ramp up right yes and the apparently that has grown I I thought it was somewhere around thirteen to fifteen free look about in twenty fourteen to start about eight eight thousand megawatts over three hours it's increase now to -- about fourteen thousand and you continue you you AB characterize your effort as an automobile going down a bumpy road changing four tires and if the tires would show up I would ask you straight out question that analogy seems to me to suggest that your task is if not impossible borderline impossible I want to ask you your level of confidence that given the sets of circumstances that we will have an electric grid that will not go brown or dark in the near future I have a concern about that and I don't want to miss read your testimony but it seems to me that there is an undercurrent in your own testimony that suggests this is a very very difficult challenge to meet I am expressing that there is a difficult challenge and I would like to emphasize we have met the challenge to this point we have been able to operate the grid reliably the challenges will leave and maintain the right system set a resources and capabilities to continue down the path of a reliable operation and I'm feel confident that that is possible okay I am hopeful that the systems and the processes and will be in place that we will bring the right resource and right resource capability to bear to maintain that reliability we look forward to continuing to work with the CPUC in president picker to ensure that the right set of resources at the right time in the right location are all there to maintain this reliability I am not suggesting we should shy away from the challenge I'm saying we have to be thoughtful about meeting that challenge with respect dem to reliability is there some kind of a definition of what we mean by reliability I've been here six years I think the reliability that we were achieving six years ago was a better kind of reliability than we are achieving presently I think that affordability is a question of how much and the definition can you give us an idea of what the definition of reliability is and what the definition of affordability is I think that's a longer discussion and I have to be able to answer in a short period there are measurements of reliability and they measure from -- howl reliability -- Burke basically measures that they measure how we perform to meet that reliability you can also measure reliability in terms of the probability of loss low is -- probability of losing also and this is this is used by the commission to ensure that that loss of low probability is maintained above a certain threshold and ensure that those resources meet that level reliability you suggested that the electrons that keep our grid balanced often are from the ghastly -- and and you talk about a date February eighteenth sometime back he gave me a report that to be my birthday in which the balancing act was on kind of a nice edge again of this thirteen to fifteen thousand dollar ramp up fifteen thousand megawatt ramp up very very quickly when fifteen thousand make a lot of demand was coming on line and the like it seems to me that we have been managing this grit reliability with the kind of electrons that some in this California legis lecture would like to see us eliminate and I have a a concern over what amounts to morally acceptable electrons an immoral electrons and your aye if I'm hearing you correctly it is the that have kept us balanced and yet we continue to try and push and move farther and farther away from the very kinds of electrons that have been available from sources that keep us balanced but they're not the sources that are favorable I think that if the fines a reliability problems as we move off of the the gas fleet what we places the reliability that right now you are being we're relying on that correct so February eighteenth I noticed that that day -- we run a nice edge and it was imports natural gas and other forms of electricity and electrons that we are trying I guess our dead level best to eliminate so I I again I I I I still have an on easy feeling about the reliability as we move forward can I get the feeling that you are hopeful and optimistic but that is aspirational the reality of the grid is that it is physics and I sometimes wonder if the aspirations are warring with the physics of electrons thank you I'll just say it to my point is that's why I mentioned that we have to be careful about not letting these resources go that we rely upon the reliability until we have no and are secure in knowing that those replacements provide all the reliability needs that we will need and that is the channel with any other questions the quirk so first of all obviously this is a very difficult problem it's a lot easier our with integrated our providers particularly if they can be just three of them they have lots of capital it cetera so we're definitely in a place where we don't know what to do next certainly for something like serving a week where the sun isn't shining and we don't have a terribly large amount of wind either -- we're going to have to have storage and that's multi billion dollars and -- the cheapest type is a course pump solar and it's not clear how you get and you've actually stated this is not clear how you get these many different small agencies to get together to purchase that and that is certainly something that we like to do this and you said there really isn't a solution right now I'm hoping when the CCA's in other load serving entities come up they'll give us some ideas but I think it's important to stress that we have reliability now but to have it in the future for going to more -- renewables we're going to need to make major purchases and it's not clear who has the credit and the ability to do this so but again you haven't told me there's a solution so there's one other thing I'm worried about P. Jeannie went bankrupt not because of particular claims from fires but because their credit rating when to junk bond status at which point they couldn't borrow money and further their providers of electricity were insisting that they pay cash up front the bank to show that they could buy the energy this is about to happen to southern California Edison it's now one click above -- if they go to that status still be out in a couple of weeks even though again date date we don't see a threat right now to them not being able to pay off these but none the less it is happening the P. you see has tools which it has used for example during the -- San Bruno alright rate payers will pay for such and such and will guaranteed that de stability of fee utility without having to go into bankruptcy to get -- a debtor financing up do you do you see Mr picker a way to help -- southern California Edison over the next month or so well this thread hangs over their head so having had lots of conversations through our financial adviser with capital markets I'm not sure that there is anything we can do legally that will satisfy them they are looking for first and foremost changes in states inverse condemnation -- definition they would like to have a way not just to know what the eventual will rate payer contribution will be for recovery and victim compensation but they want to know it soon they want to know it right away that's very difficult to do because the statute that the legislature adopted in the governor signed SB nine a one requires that the utility come forward with an application that specify the cost there won't be known right away so there's a lack of confidence in any of the tools that are available to us so we're struggling with this along with the governor's office in his strike force to find a solution that both protects rate payers insurers reliability of our electric supply and ensures that like that there's a a fund it'll compensate those victims who were who are entitled to payment by the utilities and they make their utilities investable but I think that that so far nothing that that we have put into statute or in to regulation is going to satisfy the rating agencies okay so just one more problem down the road all right thank you very much thank you thank Mister cook I am other members wanting to -- question this Pam right thank you appreciate your participation will a call up the next panel the load serving entities and generation storage providers Colin the cushioning vice president of the energy procurement and management southern California Edison Scott that murder Chau senior adviser regulatory affairs California's solar and storage association Beth Vaughn executive director California community choice association and chance money Jones chief executive officer independent energy producers association welcome to you all and you may begin your presentation Patterson and -- assembly committee members -- my name is Colin cushioning home a vice president at a southern California Edison responsible for power supply energy chairman and market operations can preset the opportunity to be here today to talk about a very important issue reliability like lead off by noting that SB one hundred -- was a very proud culmination of a long history of California energy bills of that will now be a seek to provide a higher percent clean energy in California by twenty forty five and its C. fully supports this objective however if you've heard in the earlier panel we must do so in a manner that ensures the lectures city is reliable and affordable to all Californians if we fail to make reliability and affordability our priority we will fail in achieving our clean energy goals and we'll certainly fill California in order to succeed we have to carefully plan our energy future and we have to make sure that all those serving at ease CCA's energy service providers I -- use PO use have equal responsibilities and achieving our goals may briefly touch on reliability clean energy and market operations in the context of the ongoing fragmentation of our load serving at ease in doing so I want to fully does support customer choice we support who they get their electricity from in technology that they -- they deploy but we must balance customer choice -- with a very rigorous planning an accountability framework to ensure that all load serving eighties of or able to -- fairly meet their power goals so beginning with reliability a California has a resource adequacy framework that requires the jealousy to procure it's pro rated share of system local Arian and flexibility resources need to ensure reliable electric system and because our our a requirements have been imposed on a year had a month ahead basis resource adequacy is really only procuring existing resources it's not procuring new resources the way we secure new resources in the past is we've -- through the CPC's long term procurement plan process more recently the IRP process integrated resource plan process that water the investor owned utilities to develop the needed resources are to ensure that there's enough electrical capacity on the system the the -- use have their own system they have their integrated resource plans and and and through their own boards state make sure they have sufficient resources our resource that I was the program has worked well to date of because when we first started there were three investor owned utilities and about a dozen years peas and investor owned utilities procured eighty five percent of everything that need to be purchased and because we understand our system so well we made sure we purchased the things that were needed to keep the crab reliable and we could afford to pay a premium for that because we could socialize that premium across all customers today arm the investor owned utilities are gonna be serving less than half their load of we have is many is a fifty low serving eighties coming into existence by twenty twenty one and the we're not no longer able to go out and secured those expensive resources because we'd be disadvantaging the customers that stay with us so what we do is we go out the care the resources that technically meet the requirements but that make up this cold but in in in -- in a collective sense do not fully meet the requirements and then the cal I SO has to backstop those resources that leads to very expensive double procurement so we need to come up with a better system than having each Los serving ID trying to buy the lowest cost resource that technically meets the requirement even if it's not fully effective in in meeting the reliability mandate the other challenge that we have in our resource adequacy program is that we do have some large generators -- that make it very difficult for smaller loads serving entities to purchase present picker the CPC briefly touch on this but just to put it into context we have some some generators that their size is greater than the load of some of the smaller ESP isn't CCS and if we have to procure that specific facility who is going to do it -- if you were running your house you would not appreciate it if forty people showed up and sub all rent your kitchen all right your bathroom all right your garage alright your attic you want somebody to rent your whole house and so we got to come up with a mechanism that will enable these larger facilities that are needed for reliability to be cared by a large collection of of load serving at ease so we think two things are necessary to get there the first is we do think that central buyer framework should be adopted for local resource adequacy and recognition that these transmission constrained areas have either very limited resources to procure that you can't allocate to forty different entities or they have very large generators that you can't allocate the forty different generators we also believe that the I'll use who are the reliability custodians of our grads should be the ones designated to be the central buyers and that they would procure those resources and allocate the net cost the net benefits to all those serving entities through the legislature's and the CPC's cost allocation mechanism it's called the cam it exists and we've already developed thousands of megawatts through this process so from medicines perspective we don't think we need to revisit how did you central procurement it already exists you just need to instruct the CBC or the CPC needs to adopt the utilities as the central buyers in doing this I want to be real clear on something the utilities don't make a profit and reselling power we're not allowed to by law we pass these costs through as their incurred we may actually lose money the CPC says that we did something inappropriate but we don't big money the reseller purchase power so this would be strictly reliability function that would enable the multitude of Los serving eighties that are on the system to still do what they can do but maintain reliability which is got to be our mission number one a second to ensure that we timely build the needed new resources in a way that can be -- the can be allocated to all although Cervantes the CPC needs to be given the ability to help procurement all the jurisdictional low that it regulates today the integrated resource planning process the only -- can impose procurement requirements on the utilities and energy service providers and CCA's submit our peace the CPC are but they will not -- necessarily be held accountable to perform relative to those are peas they can decide to procure something different -- and that puts the state's reliability at rest because if we thought somebody was going to do something then they did something different there there could be an unintended consequence up to changing gears your quickly on renewables report had a great discussion on renewable so I'm not gonna repeat -- much of that I do want to identify that the state California's relied on three investor owned utilities to develop the largest renewable flea and the state in the country skews me -- between three utilities were projected to be delivering over fifty thousand gigawatt hours are in a one or two starting in twenty twenty one already basically there now of which more than meets the utilities -- our PS requirements in contrast the CCA's and use peas are have through the reporting to the CPC indicated that they cared about a third of their actual our PS requirements -- if effective twenty twenty one no I'm sure this is a start up issue because a lot of these low serving as have just begun operation up but twenty twenty one is a very important date right because under -- SB three fifteen SB one hundred two thirds of our our PS has to be long term and so the resources have been procured yet they can't deliver and twenty twenty one so we want to make sure of that there's appropriate oversight of the CCA's needs peace making sure that they are procuring a in a timely manner the necessary renewal resources to allow the grid to operate both reliably and to meet our carbon goals we think the CPC should have more oversight and and and check and forty enforcement authority to make sure that the -- -- that those are PS schools being met in a timely manner what we consider whether the the vote serving ID is in a position to circle out of final issue I want to touch on here's affordability efficient market operations the investor owned utilities are required to bid all of the resources that control into the market cost again we don't make any money at this we built it because when we control when we served eighty five percent load that meant that the market generally cleared at cost that was a really good outcome for customers now that we're going to have about fifty load serving entities and utilities are serving less than half the load none of those other entities have a cost based procure logically think about what you would do yourself they will seek to maximize the revenues for their resources so we have an E. S. P. or CCA that has a critical energy storage project and their bidding in the market but I could say I just want to cover my costs bigger say how can I maximize the revenue for that second reduce the cost for my customers of so if if we have a multitude of entities bidding yeah I profit maximizing mode which is how markets operate not saying that's not not how market should operate we are going to increase the cost of power to all customers in California and we make literacy less affordable than it is today SB very difficult to electrify of the the transportation and building sectors that it's going to be incumbent upon us to do we want to hit our carbon goals -- and we're certainly going to make it difficult for low income customers to out to pay their bills so with with those concerns just want to remind the committee here that the electric grid is a very complex operation that must be very well managed I in order to -- to operate it requires perfect balancing is Mister ruff leader from cal I SO discussed and the cheating our first that fifty percent renewable goal is gonna be considered relatively easy to getting the last fifty percent clean so many things need to happen on the grid to get the last fifty percent clean we have to have a coordinated centralized planning process and we need to make sure the CPC can enforce procurement requirements on although serving ID's and to the extent that those requirements are not readily assignable because it's one project word something very complicated that can't be given out to fifty people then we need to look to the utilities to the central buyers for those projects with appropriate cost allocation and a benefit allocation central planning social equity and reliability objectives need to take the priority over individual Ellis E. procurement preferences and with that I'd appreciate your time here today thank you appreciate that hi good afternoon and -- thank you very much for the opportunity to come and -- represent Kelso and a sharp perspectives on the role that distributed energy resources could play in ensuring reliability and and and affordability -- I have three key points I'd like to make up first DVRs can and do contribute to reliability today I'll talk about that more -- second they can do a lot more and so I'll be I'll be happy to operate on the ways that the commission the I SO in the legislature can help without and then third we do contribute to affordability by providing savings to customers today and we've seen a growing trend and cancellations of utility infrastructure in transition infrastructure due to declining loads thanks to efficiency rooftop solar another distributed resources I'm going back to the first point D. ours contributing to reliability through the PC approved demand response pilot program that the tram demand response auction mechanism of flexible loads in customer cited storage are already providing qualifying for life resource adequacy capacity to Alice sees by participating directly in the chi so market so they bid and just like a generator does they -- have a price scheduled they are able to bid in a at at at any certain price like a generator does and when it's cheaper to use demand response our customer cited storage those resources our dispatch directly by the chi so and that saves customers money and it and it delivers resource adequacy credit for the participating let's serving entities that's just beginning to scratch the surface it's still a relatively young market but in addition to that supply side the are where the demand response resources participate directly in those markets distributor resources also contribute substantially to reliability by reducing peak loads and reducing peak loads -- Ellis sees are a obligation is reduced in the future because it's that peak load that sets each are a our obligation for each LSE one obvious example of that is that we used to have peak loads in the mid day -- to you you rates had peak rates from twelve to six or eleven to six because that was the peak load and as you well know with the dot curve because of the abundance of solar energy solar energy has substantially changed that and push that peak back but for several years there a solar energy was contributing drug directly to reducing the then current peak -- so now that's just a quick overview of how de ours are contributing to the liability today we think the ours can do much much more we're close to hitting the original goal of the California solar initiative originally called the million solar roofs initiative skis me would you define D. E. R. a distributed energy resources thank you for we are project that California will literally had one million so every sometime in the next few months were at over nine hundred thousand now deal and that's a lot of energy being produced I think gigawatts of installed by -- behind the meter or customers I to capacity that's actually a little bit out of date looking at the most recent numbers it's as well over seven give gigawatts of capacity that's easy to think that energy storage is a relatively mature industry as well it has been around for a few years the soft generations and of program has been funding storage since two thousand nine and we hear a lot about storage with a big name companies like Tesla often in the headlines but compared to the nearly eight thousand megawatts of rooftop solar installed in California we have only a little over a hundred megawatts of installed stored under the está program there's another two hundred plus Michael what's in the pipeline though so relative to the dot curve it's still a relatively small amount -- I want to personally thank you the legislature for passing Senate bill seven hundred last year -- that will extend the está program for other five years we estimate that -- that program in the extension of the program and that the funds on least could contribute to the installation of another two thousand plus megawatts of customer cited storage over the next several years that's enough to make a considerable down and the dot curve as to help to grow the base it incentivize customers to install -- customer cited storage and their other programs incentivizing other load modifying resources smart home energy management automated demand response but there are significant barriers that stand in the way of really allowing D. E. ours to provide the full value to the grid both for reliability and for reducing other utility infrastructure needs counsel just released a report on some of the key barriers that we see that came out at the end of January you can find that easily on our website at Kelso dot org C. A. L. S. S. A. dot org I'll talk about a couple of those report five years from the report one is that under the cuts those demand response programs the customer side of resources are not allowed to export beyond the customer meter to the grid and count towards a demand response event to count their capacity this is a significant handicap this means that if you have storage and the amount of stores that you have on site at any point exceeds your minimum load and the chi so needs that energy and needs that capacity you can't get the full amount you have to stop at the point where you're the discharge your battery only meets the onsite load this is a a huge barrier that we think just needlessly handicaps the ability of distributed resources to contribute to the cut some marketing contribute to reliability the others look at mark arcane I won't I won't dwell on it very much but it's what is the relationship to particularly customer cited resources that the utilities might need for local are a or to avoid a distribution or transmission about spent and what's already in the forecast because all of these needs are driven by their forecast what they expect to occur in the next few years with respect to load and unload shape and in that forecast you have some DVRs this is a a pretty tricky problem because it any better at to a solicitation have to somehow differentiate the capacity they're offering from what's in the forecast but I want to let you know that just over the last couple of days -- Monday and Tuesday the PC had some very productive workshops on on this and other topics related to the use of DVRs to provide distribution value and I think that there is a path forward with the elimination of those to be two barriers I think -- you could see that substantial more participation of distributed energy resources I'm contributing to reliability and savings that's a good segue because I want to talk about savings -- Howard the ours contributing to affordability the industry has long argued that investment and rooftop solar -- will help save customers money through the avoidance of utility infrastructure we just didn't have much concrete evidence in twenty sixteen the chi so in its transition planning report announced the cancellation of a hundred ninety two million dollars of transition projects and the P. Ginny territory and that the to do that largely due to lower revised demand for cast because of distributed solar energy efficiency and other resources so I was one of the first really concrete examples of savings obtained by the pointy ours that was exciting then in twenty eighteen the Kaiser released another transition planning report which provided even better news the cuts announced it was rescinding approval of projects worth more than thirteen times the savings from twenty sixteen two point six billion dollars of cancel transmission projects changer it shows that the harm that promise that we had long held out of savings for customers other than just those who actually adopt rooftop solar who dot storage themselves but other customers can be realized the same report also described a project called the Oakland clean energy initiative this the need for this project was triggered by the retirement of an aging -- power plant in the very heart of Oakland your Jack London square and this plant was essential to maintaining reliability in the area the cut so estimated that the cost of building a new transmission line because nobody wanted a new gas fired plant in the area Oakland -- as you can imagine strenuously opposed was something on the order of three hundred and sixty million dollars just for this one transmission line but in that transition report the guy so estimated that a distributed resource solution of resources in the area would cost a fraction of that probably at most somewhere around a hundred million dollars so another two hundred sixty million dollars of savings by using distributed resources to avoid -- traditional utility infrastructure my understanding is that that -- the solicitations were issued -- mid year last year and contracts or near finalization that's what I've heard and it looks like at the between P. Ginny and East Bay community energy this is another interesting twist on this processes that they collaborated and coordinated their solicitations because the utility need some some of the the aspects of the value those de ours is a community energy needs are a needs the actual energy so they work together which shows that cooperation between these entities can occur and then successfully procure a resources to meet these challenges so we think that this is a really promising and trailblazing -- project and shows that what can a curve when utilities and CCA's collaborate and coordinate when and their utility territories questions thank you thank you I will turn out to Beth font okay so I note that I left the room for a moment and you gentleman left me with the squeaky chair thank you so much not all by design not called hand not cool okay -- good afternoon chair and members -- thank you so much for the opportunity to speak with you today -- high Fong the executive director of the California community choice association I am and Kelsey CA and as a many speakers before me have explains -- the CCA's are exploding on the scene here there are nineteen CCA's now in operation serving customers about approximately forty four thousand gigawatt percent of the total aye I kitchen is territory it said about forty six percent so growing forest's -- and and I I think is we charge ahead on RD carbonization goals is present picker pointed out it's become increasingly clear that the traditional vertically integrated -- bundled utility models not the future and for millions of California's that models already shifted to the alternative which is community choice aggregation cece's represent local decision making power procured by locals for locals and with local needs and preferences in mind I'm in touch on three things today one is -- the credit worthiness and renewable print procurement second is reliability and I want to take a moment to talk about this of the future that kind of following on from your comments Scott about collaboration so in terms of procurement arm there's been some discussion around whether CCA's have the financial wherewithal to build new renewable projects on a scale that the investor owned utilities wants to -- did or enter into contracts for reliability needs so we are the new players in an uncertain market and I I get that there's been this concern I am I think that most people know MC ET -- got a credit rating investment grade credit rating this year but what I want to say is that -- an entity doesn't have to have a credit rating to be credit worthy and this if you speak with the large institutional lenders have told us in an invite you to invite them here to speak to you that they regard CCA's in a similar way to ms Eunice police for that is because of the single digit opt out on average across the CCA's as well as being transparent public agencies they must publicly post financial statements and certainly I would say the large number of bidders for anyone see see solicitation speaks volumes to how the market perceive CCS so I want to talk a little bit about the rate of change -- a year ago exactly a year ago -- Kelsey CA went to have a look at what had been procured by the CCA's in terms of new were noble development and it the number we came up with was eleven hundred megawatts and that was a total of five CCA's that had all launched by the end of twenty sixteen represented a total of fifty four hundred gigawatt hours was there any allowed alright so then present picker a referred to provided and hopefully those been handed out I look at the back there -- I think it was no I got something else for you here -- present picker referred to a number of contracts that CCA's hide -- -- published -- in November of twenty eighteen so I have for you the map of where these -- locations are for these -- different -- projects and on the back through the press release that came out as well that will give you that break down the stats but on the back to the list of all of the publicly of the -- contracts we're very transparent public agencies there's fifty nine contracts listed here on the back fifty six of those are for your or for greater than ten years which going to Mister Christians point when we're looking at -- twenty twenty one others their carmine SB three fifty that sixty percent of -- analyses portfolio have these long term contracts so there is a commitment here these are in total represent eleven CCA's because one of the CCA's in here is -- procuring on behalf of for such a joint procurement down in southern California so now where we now -- that was November of twenty eighteen right now there are several CCA's -- -- I'm sorry there's one other thing when I talk about Choi procurement that I want to highlight and it's in the press release there but in here we have -- also joint CCA's of Monterey Bay community power in Silicon Valley clean energy -- together jointly putting an R. F. P. out and signing agreements totaling almost two hundred eighty megawatts of solar coupled with three hundred forty megawatts battery storage for two separate projects incurring can counties so what I what I'm trying explains is a lot of sort of experimentation going on there in terms of this joint procurement in terms of being able to go out and procure those large -- sums of megawatts that present picker preferred to so where are we now it's the of February March of twenty eighteen twenty nineteen and that several species including some that are recently launched program so remember last year in twenty eighteen we had ten CCA's launch service and in fact in February the clean power alliance in San Jose clean energy both -- launched their third phase out to residential customers we're we're talking for CPA about a million customers but I'm gonna pick on clean power lines for a moment so while they just wants to a million residential customers they have an RFP out there seeking six hundred megawatts of renewable energy and storage clean power lines received bids for two hundred thirty four unique projects ranging from small scale battery energy storage to large large utility scale solar wind and geothermal with many bits including an energy storage component they've shortlisted these candidates and we expect by the end of spring early summer to have a list of finalize projects East Bay community energy similar story is it put a solicitation last June they're also looking for six hundred to seven hundred megawatts worth of new contracts and they're negotiating fifteen to twenty year agreements some of the criteria is for local projects some are not all of them are in California again there's Monterey Bay community power a redwood coast which is up in Humboldt County clean power as south this California choice energy authority that's procuring on behalf of for and it will be ten by twenty twenty one that they'll be current on behalf of so basically what I'm trying to say is that they're out there they're doing the procurement and when I add up all the numbers I'm gonna conservatively say that by July we should be able to report out to another fifteen hundred megawatts of new renewable developments so the bottom line is is that billions of dollars of financing for major financial partners are committed to build new projects we've cataloged about thirteen hundred of renewable energy projects either built or being built for CCA's with union labor I know that that's another issue that continued comes up we'll be adding many more to this list as project labor agreements are put in place -- for some of these new developments I want to turn to reliability to make clear to you because I think some it's not clear to a lot of folks because the governing board of the CCA is it's elected officials in the local community however we are load serving and cities and therefore must comply and have all the same obligations as the other load serving and cities be the investor owned utilities or energy service providers that means that we have to comply with the state's resource adequacy and renewable portfolio standard requirements also have to it -- submit integrated resource plans every two years so I feel I just need to respond to present pickers common about the eleven waivers and and he he is correct that there is an issue out there with waivers absolute agree but the eleven where waivers which are actually published on the C. P. UC's on website -- one is an I owe you and the other ten are electrics -- yes peas however he is correct that CCA's in the last year have also -- fought for waivers that there there there is a there is an issue that has to be solved I'm resource adequacy I just want to point out is one component of reliability so while the commission set up are a policy rules the callous so as you heard from mark -- Mister ruff later and also the CC so I want to go to what is the problem that we're actually trying to solve we've heard a lot about what might be going on but it would really help everyone to have a clear assessment of the problem there's no bottom up study of how the disaggregated realty retail market is actually impacting the reliability market here's what we agree on we agree that the capacity market is tightening we understand that low serving entities are filing waivers but it's not clear that there isn't capacity available for instance someone could be holding on to our it as a buffer against possible future loads shifting or the floor price could be unreasonable so there's a number of solutions and I think that I have to compliment -- the si PC I think by putting out a decision that the majority of people didn't agree with actually pushed us to collaborate there are others a lot of discussions going on there are very interesting ex parte meetings with interesting bedfellows there's of of of a sense of urgency in a flurry in a frenzy to to to really work together to find a solution here so we all agree that the forecasting allocation process needs to be fixed and all stakeholders including energy division staff of waited with lots of good ideas we all agree that a multi year are a obligation is the right framework going forward we propose putting in place a utility near term sales framework to facilitate getting the are a products in the utility portfolios out into the market with load moving to the C. C. A.'s the excess supply from the I owe you should also follow Kelsey see has consistently attic advocated for LSE's Max myself procurement before any central procurement however if there is a local ari shortfall then the CCA support the notion of residual procurement by central procurement and city I think energy division stop in the a truck three report that came out this week proposed a simple yet we think very effective idea which is that all the load serving and cities need to communicate better with each other at particularly in terms of the process of forecasting an allocation but see sees are not sitting idle why these issues are being hostile in policy venues instead were coming together to identify new and innovative ways of addressing the local reliability issues so for instance I know a year ago concerned about Metcalf for instance what we're doing now is experimenting with this joint CCA procurement and the reliability area collectively we have five C. C. A.'s with an aggregate load of nearly twenty thousand gigawatt hours so think about P. Jeannie when you take out the -- G. efficiency in the D. A.'s the CCA is there eight thousand gigawatt hours so that group of five continues CCA's in the southern bay area have come together they have an are a photo out to contract for joint are a portfolio services this will enable them to procure at scale multi year are a said we're trying to respond to the problems that have been identified all right lastly I just want to take a moment to talk about it developing a shared vision so the session metamorphosis of the energy sector so when I think about I think of the caterpillar transforming into the butterfly I guess my question to all of us is is what is our butterfly what is it that we're trying to change into and I think that we really we were all really good at identifying lots of problems I think that we really need to develop a shared vision of the future so I'm gonna start and I'm gonna be controversial just so we can start having the conversation with some press stating publicly that wants out of the power generation and procurement business N. P. Jeannie choosing to file chapter eleven reorganization bankruptcy well they elected to file they didn't have all right I think we should be talking about in a in a not so distant instance distant future with the utilities focus on the safe management other electric Sir infrastructure and essentially become a wires only business this plant there is an idea if that's the in in game then we only to think about what is the framework we need to put in place that will ensure clean reliable and affordable electric generation service for all customers that will also ensure that we meet our aggressive climate goals so I have a few ideas also controversial I'm fully empower local agency providers to advance California's chronicles and by that I mean to assist teaching is accent from the retail service for example and give local governments the ability to expand their energy electricity programs in a manner that fits the needs of the local community that could include absorbing P. genies remaining bundle customers the option to service provider of last resort option to service all retail provider -- in I think support the existing rights of little local jurisdictions to establish publicly owned utilities by removing barriers taxed expedite the process well but that raises the question about what of the what about the parts of the state where public power option isn't readily available I think we need to talk about the establishment of statewide public agency to serve final customers until public option is available we would also need a plan to rebalance the I'll use portfolios this is been happening slowly with the sale of I'll use a renewable and ari products to realign supply and demand to follow the party low customers but there need to be a structure divestment plan and if you really think about what reliability looks like in a future without the fleet of gas fired power plants then it's got to be based on investor owned utility distribution system with a transparent open access platform that facilitates the deployment of distribution energy resources the DVR's that Scott spoke have and other demand side management strategies okay I know that these ideas just add to the controversy in the complexity but I think that without a clear vision of what we want to transform into -- they were just gonna spend our wheels trying to solve problems issue by issue and run the risk that all the pieces won't add up to a whole at the end of the day so I look forward to working collaboratively with legislators and the stakeholders to develop a shared vision of the future and just all these complex problems thank you it's just money Jones I see I drove but Sherman holding out so you're now the chair congradulations let me be that from the get go that the electrons that I represent are of the highest moral caliber some of our more moral than others but they're all very moral and -- -- actually -- it's been my experience that like tries have are pretty a moral which is why we're having this conversation today -- so I'm Janice but he Johnson with the independent energy producers -- we are an institution it's been around since nineteen eighty to represent one of everybody so solar wind geothermal biomass and natural gas -- in well -- we operated a whole cell function we think of us as costs go where you can get a lot of stuff cheap -- and or cheaper -- weird -- known for pushing technologies a lot of the technologies that are here today with us -- we have and -- been in the forefront what we know -- and what has worked and so I think a lot of what the discussions are here in the legislature -- as good as we go forward should be about predicated on that a colleague of mine was talking to me this morning about our our integrated resource plan which is -- sort of now become a thing of its own -- is where we want to be that's the vision of where we're going to be in twenty thirty and twenty fifty -- are a as with now -- and it's pretty straight forward -- you know -- resource adequacy is -- having the -- you need it where you need it -- for adequate period of time -- and -- -- I just have to share it underscore the point that reliability is the key here okay if we suddenly start having reliability problems based on decisions we've made because of a moral generation for example or anything else all bets are off on our aspirational goals the deal with them -- can get president picker walking us down memory lane of the San Diego situation -- you know -- I live to that and you don't you don't want to go through that trust me well and are a terms of of understanding -- what generally needs to happen -- but at that I think is you've heard as we've talked a long a lot of this is local very specific in terms of of the locality we have sort of in a broader range but a lot of times this is driven by unique geographic area -- I think it's got indicated you have seen this market shift occur over the last -- so over years where amount of solar -- just to put this in perspective in -- two thousand eight we had three hundred megawatts of utility scale solar -- today we have over eleven thousand megawatts a utility scale in two thousand eight was fifty to sixty cents a kilowatt hour people are coming online now -- sub five cents and actually sub three cents my job is to help build markets of people make lose money I don't know but that's their business however -- because while that is a success is got indicated we moved at the peak from that date to elsewhere -- the peak is now shifted to up to forty nine o'clock in this is what we're the challenge becomes because even in California we have a fairly regular occurrence of the sun no longer being with us gas and I'm just going to say you know I don't give it many opportunities to say nice things about gas because that's not acceptable anymore -- but the gas is -- the work course from the standpoint of how we meet role of gas has been -- annual energy mix for twenty eighteen gas was about thirty percent of the overall mix it was forty percent so it is it so it has been impacted by additional -- you primarily so -- ended a resource however and this is important as as a part of peak resources it's over fifty percent meeting that the lights would not of state on had they not been there at those plans not been able to ramp up and ramp down so it's reliable it's affordable -- it's there now -- and these are modern plants I I spent a lot of time having to argue about the -- the the -- the resources California has added are clean resources we have renewables and a modern gas plants are clean they they are -- you know from the standpoint of I think the I SO study for on SB three fifty fifteen twenty fifteen data that was forty percent of the Daniel energy mix and was left it was about one percent of the criteria pollutants so it is not a major -- -- eight environmental impact on our state and by the way they have to buy offsets for everything they produce including -- CO two so -- it's part of the mix and and and what I want levy with on that is is that that's going to be with this for a while so rather than wasting time on how quickly we can shut that down if there are improvements we can make it other technologies great but that's going to be with us for awhile storage has been desperate is proving to be very useful I was part of the board -- technology advancement we identified storage is game changer that's proving to be true -- and we are working it into the system -- in places where it makes sense -- the that is very good at regulation is very good at a number of things at the beginning stage from the standpoint of -- how it is in the market but we anticipate that going forward civil my members had built hybrid systems as a matter of fact one of my members was one of the first to build those systems -- it down a chili so -- the the there there is a -- -- you know with that this is becoming an increasing amount of our resource mix -- there is a tension -- -- the the -- it with respect to again we represent wholesale storage there is -- destructive energy which I think Scott referred to there's a there's a lot of technical issues where there is some tension with respect to how how things get integrated in the cal I SO wholesale market what the rules apply and we're we are sensitive about that from the standpoint of we operate our whole so rules and if people want to join our party that's great I would necessarily recommended but you're welcome to it but you got to play by the same rules trail detail real quick but the point is that there is a tension there that would not withstand effect that we support a storage an obvious he's got support storage there are live issues that may or may not pop up here -- -- that the at the the other issue that I think is important and I just want to go through -- this fairly quickly about what else -- is in the system that we can be looking towards -- assisting on some of the resource adequacy needs is geographic scope -- which I think that earlier -- we do have Nguyen regimes throughout the west that are -- -- that operate at different times and said in fact some of them during our peeks here -- that we should be avail in ourselves to and we need to be very clear that the I SO in the P. you see -- are -- adequately looking at in properly planning for the future need to add additional interstate transmission to avail ourselves -- to resources are a across the west we are not an island -- she'll thermal obviously operates at night resources in -- -- in the state primarily in Mr Garcia's district -- and -- and and in the end those in northern California to -- -- in -- in in the -- Lake County in cinema area -- we've got a by a mass technologies where it which are an integral part of our and agriculture communities we're going to continue to grow food -- in California that's a place we should you know look and did simple fact of the matter is we are gonna see solar continue to grow it is a very low cost resource and the the the issue for re -- for developers of solar is how to keep that going because at some point in time you run into -- if the at the vet the eight the economic value of the energy your supply in mid day is zero you're not going to get up in volume so the question is where you know where we're going to put those resources and I think we've got a lot of things we can be doing with access seller in the middle of the day when that is an issue with respect with which respect to -- water press process seen a which is electricity prices hydrogen production manufacturing that sort of thing so that so that's kind of where things set it right now in terms of challenges exist in are a -- we've just finished one cycle we are slowly moving towards something that may make sense of -- -- did it finally adopted a multi year are a before it was only an annual -- -- -- resource adequacy proposal meeting that day they only had a super -- -- look one year out the reason that's a problem is that if you need to make it -- economic investments in your equipment if you're gas plant for example you need to make -- some maintenance upgrades not be doing that you're going to be needed sec and I would argue the same is true for demand response or storage -- doing that on an annual basis is very difficult to do in any sort of affordable way so the longer it's art lovers out the lower the prices and I think the better off it is they -- we supported the energy -- divisions -- argument for a five year that didn't happen we really wanted to see a three year eighty percent that didn't occur either -- but we will remain -- you know active in the -- that in the discussion there -- there was discussion earlier on central buyer and I know there's a there's a proposal least one bill at a pop up here at some point in time -- you know we're talking about that we're we're trying to figure out how that actually would work of who who does that -- -- I'd not sure that -- ms lines the invitation have a state a procurer for most of the state makes a lot of sense in terms of a provider last resort that seems to me to be racing backwards -- pretty quickly but will look at it we just want to make sure the metamorphosis is swallows and -- -- -- beautiful and not -- you crappie moths so option there so -- it but I do want to say that I that I think that -- one of the things that this aggregation of CCA's -- vats helpful -- because part of the problem is my people sold anybody -- because we're selling -- a moral electron so are -- it the larger the volume and geographic where you to where they need to go is very important because you know it it's one thing that have to do you know thirteen or twenty deals with the off the five megawatts at a time you know at being able to respond to something that's two hundred megawatts -- you still have to do all the paperwork to do all that but it's a lot easier to do -- so I'm gonna kind of wrap up here but I do think it's important -- in again -- president picker took turned us -- that down -- it -- you know you did that the the restart so recent pass a guess it is -- what happened in San Diego in two thousand one and I'm not raising that because I think the same fax pop up or anything else it was a different time there were different issues but just understand that there are a lot of really good people trying to do the right thing and believing they were doing right circles no one anticipated that happening and the people engaged in responding to economic rational signals the market went south on them they were dead that they did not have adequate resources to acquire resources and also market and they just kicked the customers back and we played clean up for many many years after that so I I what I'm suggesting here is is that the time being spent on what would plan B. is -- in being somewhat cautious in terms of how it will be in the future -- is appropriate because I I I I'm not you just anybody it's in the market right now is trying to do anything on toward but there are a incident forcing circumstances and how all these different pieces -- interact with judge are going forward -- -- could be different than what we anticipate -- and so just two other points you know in the future as we had more soul this system are re at the reliability today is predicated upon a really hot day it's hot in the northwest it's hot in Phoenix and we have to figure out you know how well how we're going to meet -- I meet a load that's gonna shift as we add more solar to that's the best of a problem with the problem's going to be is is winter days when we don't have a lot of sun wind and in what we do that so that that's all shifting and it and that's not anything that's immediate that we need to panic about but we need to be mindful of it -- so as we go forward the main issue that I think we need to talk more about and again I'm going to repeat this what California's doing is basically adding clean energy so I don't think that's even a dispute anymore the real question is reliability and affordability so we be we ought to be at a no stings that enhance reliability that that don't break the bank costs for everybody not just people putting stuff on their roads or something stuff in the garage -- so the hotel sector that Iraq I PP sector that represent -- will work to make that attainable and -- we look forward to future interaction with this committee as the -- session moves forward thank you thank you all turn to members if they have any questions or thank quirk Mister Smarty Jones you hit the nail on the head the question is reliability and affordability to get ready to utilities yet and I will say P. Jeannie was forced by the fact that they could no longer -- borrow money they could no longer get cash that wasn't really a choice they wanted to make they in fact had tried to get funding in the P. use in October in the P. you see didn't approve it -- and had the P. you see frankly and I know Mr picker will disagree with me but had they done something similar to what was done on the San Bruno case that however those weren't happening and maybe Mister pickers right and they couldn't have but I don't believe that but okay anyway getting back to your situation so reliability and cost and you know a small and a D. like Solano county is not likely to be able to balance everything without having so much storage that it becomes very expensive much like why am so we are better off as you said when people can get together but where the I SO looks it how they're gonna balance load and then the C. P. U. C. looks at it how would you -- in vision the coordination of the with the in here I mean you're between the I SO in the P. you see we have an idea of what needs to be done how do you envision that being translated to the C. C. A.'s working together so are you talking specifically about the resource adequacy process of forecasting allocation that goes on between the cow eyes so the energy commission the CPC yes but also cost because arm I know you have felt because once you're looking at getting higher levels then you're going to have to have -- storage and the cheapest way to do that right now is pump storage other maintain other means maybe batteries will get cheaper at cetera but the combination of keeping prices down and meeting their climate goals and having adequate resources is a very complex one and no one of the CCA's is a real can be able to balance all of that so how do you envision the best way is to take the information from those two agencies get it down into the CCA's then who is going to ask this you know who's gonna tell CCA axe they have to work with C. C. a B. and C. C. A. C. and D. but you know a doesn't want to get involved I mean it it becomes quite complex so I'm sure you've thought about this how do you well how would you solve this we say to the look at me go Kelsey CA you can do it -- so that's you know part of our role is this coordination of the CCA's on every level night it's sort of exhausting but but it it's exciting -- so we have an active board of the operational members we have staff committees very active staff committees right down to procurement committees that are -- while observing all anti trust rules -- are exchanging information templates Senate offer contract you know ways to move forward says a lot of collaboration and you see it even in Filene's at -- at the PC they're not all done by Kelsey said they'll be joint CC is the common interests will get together -- go to the A. R. B. the folks that are working on an electric vehicle programs and want to have a say there so so I guess I have to say that there is a big coordination state wide there is also entities like down in southern California the California choice energy authority who is doing work on behalf of -- a whole lot of the smaller cities and that's the group I was talking about the table to do the procurement at at scale -- to handle some of the data management -- services that are required so -- I think that it's evolving I don't see anyone CCA my experience is they don't want to head off on their own they show up at our door asking for help and information and one of the things that I believe and I have -- just really have have the capacity but but I think what you know this is something that we couldn't work with the other load serving entities on like the I. O. use in terms of helping to educate and bring these folks on board I mean I think it is going to be these joint CCA's doing more activities but also the example Scott gave the Oakland energy initiative where the I. O. U.'s and the CCA partners together to to address some of these these tough issues I just feel that work at this is all great no problem but I don't have look we lost the governor because of rolling blackouts and I just don't want to see that happen again and I just don't see you haven't given me a mechanism that is a fail safe and I think we need some sort of a fail safe mechanism are given the independence of each of the CCA's M. I'll just let leave that as an a homework problem for you okay thank you structure thank you I want to pay you back a little bit on Mister quirk and I'll do that a second a first of all a Mister Smarty Jones I I I I do think though that are a moral electrons can be rehabilitated that I want to ask a couple questions to about that my concern is that if we rushed so fast to get out of natural gas we really lose -- ability for reliability and I I I think we were all very concerned about that however there has been some conversation about -- perhaps renewable natural gas what what ask what that looks like there's been some talk about hydrogen injected natural gas there's been some talk about that and there's been some talk apparently that these can fuel existing for fossil fuel plants what is that is that realistic is there a possibility in it and all of this and could perhaps this be some kind of a fail safe methodology here aye aye I concur with Mister quirk I was mayor Fresno in twenty and at a night in what nineteen the ninety nine two thousand two thousand one I live through those those blackouts and and brown outs and I don't ever want to live through that again and so I'm trying to figure is there a in term more rational more fail safe approach to moving toward this a hundred percent but in the end term we do have some steps that give us increased levels of reliability and a fail safe that we may be able to trust I I'm not making no conclusions on asking a question about does possibilities right now I'm that was respect reliability and affordability let let me respond with that based -- on what I do what I generally now because that there there's some specifics that questions there that would take a little love for the research for me to answer completely -- renewable natural gas has been used in the system before -- mega and as so that's that's something that it did could happen -- we do -- yeah I believe import a fair amount of renewable gas that it was my understanding was ending up in -- in the system as well -- we use actually take methane read off the landfills and operate them in -- research reciprocating engines into knocks problems there -- the other thing that the two other issues -- renewable natural gas my understanding is is that it tends to be significantly more expensive than an actual gas we currently will currently use for that so there is a a potential cost factor there and the second one is it may have a higher or better use in other sectors of the economy that have less it at to adjust -- you know agriculture for it for example in terms of food processing there may be areas where it could be better utilized their at least I've heard that that discussion going on so I don't think it's a I don't think the answer is no -- but it's it's I think it's more complicated nuanced and and maybe having additional cut -- readable natural gas in the system will help alleviate some of a help reform the the a moral law -- select runs that the people are concerned with I doubt it but maybe it would help that -- missed questioning the thoughts about this as well yes No thanks for the question so it is it is possible to question is to to what extent so -- a lot of modern day power plants have very specific -- operating requirements and so of the renewal natural gas -- something you know I know a bit more about than that and I did it he's gas and moisture content so when you planned the there were no other no well that's what gas and with the with the the record natural gas you still have to get but will call a pipeline quality there certain specifications that the by points out to maintain and if you don't you're going to avoid the manufacturer's warranties on those power plants so -- it is possible it's just it's just a question of how much can you put into the system before you start to impact certain kinds equipment that are that are dent so your backyard barbecue okay -- just when it is cực this is a question out there answered if you wish you don't have to -- my concern is that I feel like we're getting the aspirational element ahead of the real reliability and the affordability and if in fact as has been repeated here that the reliability and affordability has to be the lead here or we have customers and voters who are going to be very concerned about this do we have a and I asked this of anybody on the panels eight eight are we satisfied that there is a process here that elevates reliability and affordability above the aspiration of the butterfly because if we don't I fear that we end up with the aspiration driving the entire decision making and then reliability and affordability begin to suffer yelp I'll take that your first it I think in in elements we do take into account but it it's not being done in a systematic comprehensive way of my my biggest concern for California right now is we don't have a clear vision for how we're going to get from today to tomorrow of kind of following up on on this once in a comment of veto it may be an outside of some folks but really it it would be appropriate to keep the gas fired power plants around for an extended period time the goal should be to reduce the amount of natural gas we burn them by ideally let's try not to burn any gas in those power plants and once we can assure ourselves that the system can operate without the natural gas fired power plants then we can retire them -- but we should be opposed to just having them there there like a backyard you know a generator -- for people that have -- a critical needs so that that should be the the focal point in in doing it then we can allow the technology curve to evolve over time so the race to get all the clean stuff on very quickly -- communicate very big bet on today's technologies and there may be some breakthroughs to come along that will afford you know allow us to leverage much more affordable ways of generating electricity so it should just be very measured approach to our an electric sector of in and remember electric sector is is just less than twenty percent of the total carbon emissions in California we we we want to use -- electricity to electrify transportation and and buildings which is more than half the the carbon emissions so if we if we rates to try to get all the carbon out electricity and raise the price maybe make it less reliable we are going or seriously jeopardize our ability get people wanna buy electric cars and and electrify their their their property so thoughtfully and -- in in unfortunately because it's such a such a involve complicated situation -- in our regulatory and let's say process he's like to look at things in silos it's really difficult to cut across all the different -- -- -- dimensions that are in play here I think up don't speak for the chair but we've had some conversations about this that one of the things we hope for at it is that and then I don't think that we've had this in the six years that I've been here and on this committee which is a long serious look at the kinds of policies necessary to get where we want to in a in a in a careful and coordinated way moving forward it is the haphazard approach and the wishful thinking approach that concerns me -- and I I hope we could see this open door as a as an opportunity to really have serious discussions about how do we get to where we want to be and not be in such a rush to get there that we are willing to have a step by step fought full process that -- gets us to where we want to get to but does not as I think Mr quirk suggest risk the the trustworthiness of the people California and what we're about thank you Mister thank you script thank you Mister chairman thank you panelists I'm I'm actually very excited about what the future of California looks like but I'm have a lot of questions to miss a portion of it as I was at another and another committee as we lead towards -- a row to de carbonization and renewable energy at one hundred percent I want to echo Mister Patterson thoughts on how we get there but I'm looking at it through a very different perspective as well not only on the consumer points but also on the labor front and so I'd be curious and I don't know if we've had these conversations in the past or what information is available when it comes to certain types of energy and what that what the future work force of California looks like I represent a district that is twenty percent below the national poverty line in Los Angeles in the main urban area and I want to put people to work but I'm not quite sure what that work is or what those apprenticeship programs look like or what the partners are in if we are going to create a a pathway to one hundred percent did I mention there's also an opportunity to create really incredible jobs for people and so how do we get there I think there's a those are two items that are not mutually exclusive and so you can have one without the other and so if there's any ideas at the table from from the industry or from partners and stakeholders that we can talk about not only how do we get the policy to get us to one hundred percent renewable but what is the work that needs to happen with actual people to make sure that that happens insult thoughts or opinions whether now or later are very welcome thank you I'll just grab that for the moment I I think you're raising a agreed issue and one thing I would say about communities community choice aggregation a for many of them it was a way to implement their climate action plans but it's also about jobs in the community and so I think that's what we're seeing in terms of particularly and I can provide you with a lot of examples of follow up with you but some of the examples -- from CCA's that have been up and running for awhile and have some of these programs and it goes to I think appoint Mister Christian made about the electrification a lot of them have this real goal of impacting electrification of transportation and buildings and there there are jobs in here and there there are jobs in terms of -- some of the local renewable programs but they may come and go right and what you're looking for is something that -- is is this for it so about this more later but I think of in particular like San Jose clean energy and the reasons why they've made this move -- the meristem a cart is been very outspoken on this because he is such a diverse to make sure that -- jobs are part of of what they're bringing to the community so and just very quickly -- assembly woman are Darcy -- out all arranged to have somebody reach us give me I'm sorry thank you god but my apology this group -- the will -- get somebody to ask can I connect with you talk about the job programs at southern California Edison house a lot of jobs there are ultimately are in the stem fields right it's about developing -- yet it's the engineering and and that then the field the the field engineering work that goes on -- destined gives a number of twenty thousand dollars scholarship to your to underserved communities -- in the stem field and one make sure that you're aware of that and and have your -- your students applying for those scholarships but there's also a lot of craft employees and then off to the construction of these projects leads to jobs but not the construction is sort of a one time a job and then and then it moves on so -- definitely think there's opportunities for the communities and -- and all all of the stakeholders to partner in this regard I'll just make a couple of a couple of points -- so one I think the programs developed by the public utilities commission under the California solar initiative and then -- and then the extension the solar and multiple multi family affordable homes have some elements of job training I mean it's well it's the relatively small programs in the grand scheme of things but it's a good model for -- using those programs to try to leverage some workforce development and make sure that their opportunities in those areas for jobs in urban areas me a lot of -- and and I'm not anyway dismissing the the need and the long run for large scale renewables but a lot of that development is fairly remote and to employ people in dense urban areas like San Diego or center there LA you are necessarily looking at development more distributed resources and energy efficiency jobs the latest to solar jobs report I believe -- had a number around seventy thousand in the solar industry broadly and the Los Angeles area in particular we have we at council have begun to to work more intensively with LA W. P. which hasn't a Taurus the difficult interconnection process that makes sewer development storage development and LA for difficult and it's -- we think really holding back the market so it's removing those kinds of barriers and then preparing for increases in DVRs -- within those are in areas making sure the work forces there we -- would love to cooperate with you and and folks in LA and mayor Garcetti's recent now spent that he wants to eliminate the reliance on three gas fired power plants there is a large local reliability value that those plans provide and -- that will necessitate of a very comprehensive and thorough look at what the ours can do to replace that and provide equivalent reliability service there's it will necessitate much more development in the LA area I thank you for for that -- as periodic comet in a world transition your comment into public common we appreciate those who were some a member Carillo have good news and bad news now I have before I take your pick idea before I came to the P. you see I spent a number of years working on citing permitting and helping to interconnect very large renewable energy projects in this is Mister Marcia was saying a lot of those were remote but the filled a need at a time that the housing industry was in collapse in the commercial building industry was in collapsed because of a lot of construction workers because a lot of this work is actually construction do travel they follow they follow the construction trends so at one point weeks week we've we've we counted about thirty five thousand people working on various -- desert and Central Valley renewable energy projects that was pretty important for particularly those people who are in the organized trades it was impossible to find anybody any any union hiring hall any place in the Inland Empire for a large period of time because they are all out working and that created a lot of family wealth but what it didn't really result in what was a lot of long term prosperity and long term jobs in that particular sector what we've seen in the solar industry is that a lot of the work was actually an origination in the soft parts of the job so I meant going door to door finding customers with the most recent statistics is in California is the jobs in the solar industry of chop dropped by fifty percent because they're sort of a a a a attenuation in the market place so I'm I'm why worry that we rely too much on energy policy is jobs policy if you're if there are jobs that are going to be long term and persistent is going to be where you have a very firm infrastructure that needs a lot of servicing so I keep pointing people towards union blind work and said that is probably why there's going to be the most jobs with quality longevity they both creek -- family wealth and because the polls don't move around unlike construction they'll probably be more community prosperity building as a result of it and I think we have to be very thoughtful about these things and really analyze what are the jobs we want in the future what's the nature of our energy construction I just don't think that energy policy is automatically a good jobs and an income policy thank you for that we'll turn to public comment we appreciate the panel for their participation there inside okay good afternoon -- my name's Melissa brown on behalf of East Bay community energy which is a C. CA serving Alameda county and eleven of its cities -- to address -- is Carillo questions about jobs they did want to point out that one of A. B. C.'s core goals is to invest in local development and we in fact have a local development business plan that was developed with our board and stakeholders over the course of more than a year that be happy to share copy with you if you're interested okay that we also have prevailing wage language and our long term renewables contracts and we expect that our investments will result in project labor agreements so there are multiple ways that we expect that our activities will result in job creation and sustaining jobs as well in their local area -- I also wanted to address the concerns and questions raised by Mister Patterson and Mr quirk regarding reliability and affordability -- from an affordability perspective I would just say our local board is committed to low rates in this puts a lot of pressure on our procurement team to make sure they're entering into affordable transactions markets can work to coordinate low cost procurement that maximizes value if the rules are set up correctly and -- we get signals from the market that enable us to ascertain and value our resources and decide what we're going to invest in -- that can fall apart when the regulatory rules are unpredictable or poorly designed and so that's part of what we're trying to work through with the si PC to make sure that the rules are adopted to today's landscape in a way that set us up to be able to maximize the value of the system at least cost out that they're kind of two competing proposals at the PC regarding how to and -- ensure reliability as Matt one is a residual central procurement full procurement system under residual procurement system you give LSE's the right incentives to maintain some of the clean investments that they're trying to make such as energy storage while still having a backstop to ensure that the lights don't go out so -- direct response to Mr quirk as that's how you make sure the lights don't go out a full procurement system may accomplish the same goal of the lights not going out but may do so in a way that really inhibit our ability to invest in the right clean -- source as self maybe with that thought thank you very much is chairman Toni Braun about half the California misplayed Khiladi says he Asian the state wide association public power in California -- reliability is the paramount -- goal of public power entities that is reflected in our long history of ownership of generation and as long and are reversed contracting with generation make sure that we keep the lights on for our customer owners in our in our community citizens I think it's important as we consider all this issues in the immense complexity of it to recognize that we're not writing on a blank slate here the legislature is already legislated -- at the to lease code requires that load serving entities not only maintain adequate supplies to meet load but also for -- forward planning obligations it out in the I. R. P. provisions in the utilities code all the load serving entities and that's most of the larger PPO use as well as the CPUC jurisdictional entities have to file I are peas and in the entire P. demonstrations of how they're meeting their load serving obligations and planning for reserves must be part of those documents so fortunately we're not making this up out of whole cloth we've already thought a little bit about these issues and I would think building on what we've already put in the in place in the statute and on the ground it would seem to get prudent -- place to start so we have PO use over twenty that are in the I SO and they set their own planning reserve margins as dictated with in the context of the state requirements but that's only part of the story there each year they get local capacity obligations that are allocated to them by the I SO and they get flexible capacity obligation so we've heard a lot about local capacity obligations and the thorny Nessa's associate with procurement local capacity this is been going on for a decade many of the P. a user smaller much smaller than the CCA's they have been able to meet the local capacity obligations that the I SO directs and the flexible capacity obligations that the I SO directs -- the if they don't the I SO goes out and has backstopped procurement so where is the safety net we've heard that with respect to the PO using the I SO if they do not meet their obligations which are defined by the ISO the I SO will go out and if there's a shortfall -- do the procurement and allocate those entities the cost so again we're not on a blank slate here we have a the P. you use that are not in the eyes so they're subject to the same obligations to meet load and resources in a real time basis as Mister ruff leader described so if they don't do that they violate various standards ants are subject to incredibly rigorous financial penalties are forced through the federal energy regulatory commission ultimately so they have a great incentive in you and you see that reflected in their in their planning practices so what we have put in place as Mister Smarty Jones indicated has worked pretty well is it a little frayed around the edges because of the challenges that we've talked about today there's no doubt about that -- fortunately we're not starting from a system where we had three loads serving entities and now we're gonna have over fifty the I SO indicated in a filing it made it for earlier this year late last year that there are forty load serving entities that currently deals with in its own resource adequacy regime right now so we're starting from a much higher number than three and but we're going to greater to segregation and we also have the behind your challenges and things like that so we absolutely need think fought fully about what we're putting in place going forward -- but I would urge the committee as we look at these things not to throw the baby out with the bath water I think there are some targeted things that we know we need to solve the particularly the low hanging fruit associated with that it's fairly discrete number of local resources that we know are needed to keep the lights on -- and probably need a a forward looking revenue stream to make sure that they're staying around resource is not the multi billion dollar project we might build in the future it's the gas plants that are in the ground right now and we need to make sure that we as we move to the D. carbonization and a low carbon future or the zero carbon future that we make sure that we maintain that safety net -- to ensure that we keep the a grade a stable and secure as we meet our energy policy goals so we know it's gonna be a long conversation we look forward to working with the committee thank you thank you for your comments good afternoon Mister chairman and member yes over there in with their others watching there are welcome cal chamber -- reliability and affordability are some of the primary concerns of our fourteen thousand member businesses that we do really appreciate you holding this hearing before we start considering all these bills this year -- we do remain concerned regarding legislation that seeks to improve it to impose mandates to procure one energy technology over another spend millions of dollars on climate programs that may or may not be effective at reducing emissions are banned certain technology customers members are big and small we have tech companies we have manufacturing we of small family owned businesses and employ hundreds of thousands of Californians these companies continue just pay some of the highest rates in the nation we move towards full reliance on renewables -- as they're currently defined by the law does relate risk the reliability of our electric grid and we need to be cautious and how we get there so in one of the potential costs associated with all the myriad other issues that we're dealing with an energy world right now including wild fires and climb an adaptation of resilience we encourage and appreciate the thoughtfulness and prudence with which is committee will consider energy bills going forward and we look forward to working with you this year thanks thank you Mister chairman and a assembly member Correa thank you for staying and for those that are still watching -- I know we all want to get out of here and it was and I wasn't planning on speaking and tell you raise the jobs issue -- ag Calpine owns and operates seven hundred and twenty five megawatts of geothermal facilities and like in cinema county those facilities employed full time three hundred people plus a hundred plus contractors daily those are hourly work force makes a hundred thousand plus benefits and bonuses except track those are jobs that do not require a college education unfortunately AB are seven hundred and twenty five megawatts of Jeff thermal we're not sure how those resources are going to continue to operate because they're not being port procured they are cost effective every model has shown that there cost effective they're important to median R. G. H. G. goals and also our reliability goals they're available about ninety eight point five I'm wrong on that but about ninety nine percent of the time so we have run legislation the last couple of years with that assembly member Aggie where curry Mr Garcia -- because we think your thermals a really important part of the resource mix going forward -- both existing and in New and Mr Garcia would like to have that those same jobs and economic opportunities in his district but number of the people that have testified before you today have opposed that -- those bills and so I just want to again say this is still an issue and something that we need to grapple with as we're looking at an art towards our future and how we're going to achieve reliability in an affordable way that accomplishes our GHG goals and as an added benefit creates job but not necessarily the single driver I hear you on that but it is a huge benefit so thank you thank you born column policy advocate was Sierra Club California thank you for the opportunity to comment today when most people think about climate pollution they think about power plants in industry however a quarter of California's GHG emissions are from homes and buildings the majority of which come from onsite combustion of gas for you for heating buildings are still a major gap in California's climate strategy Andy carbonization conversations roughly ninety percent of California's thirteen million homes and buildings rely on gas for water heating and space heating these gas appliances consume more gas than all the state's power plants creating a major source of unregulated climate pollution plus gas appliances worse an indoor and outdoor air quality and the distribution of gas to buildings is found to be increasingly vulnerable to leaks and explosions California must prioritize efforts to electrify homes and buildings to achieve climate safety and affordable housing goals and stop were seen our depend are gas dependency leaders of state agencies have a knowledge the need to electrify gas and uses empower them with clean and electricity Californians support this change just as they want clean energy on the grid they also want clean and safe energy in their homes now we just need the policy changes to make this a reality for Californians thank you thank you good afternoon committee members my name is Joseph with men I'm with plants look clean energy we are the CCA serving San Matteo county I just wanna one reiterate the points that made -- and then also point out what we need to get through this is collaboration with our state agencies not the sort of fights that we've been seeing and we're trying hard to do that with the state agencies I took a lot of heart in the February decision from the P. you see about the studies they're going to release I hope they come out sooner rather than later the end of the year probably is too late for those studies considering the P. you see is that it wants to look at central buyer in October the study is that they're doing will inform that decision so having the studies after the decision doesn't make much sense to me and I think that gets into the need to really take a hard look at the state agencies that are managing the are a system they need to self reflect on how that needs to change to keep up with the market changes that are coming P. C. E. has had requirements come down from the state agencies that were around yes when we tried to correct those just eight through discussions with the state agencies it was very difficult to get accurate numbers about the are a we were supposed to per care because they were using out of date information and so you know there's a there's a two way street here that I think we need to talk about and I think again took to Mister quirks point a residual buyer can do what's being asked to be done we put forward a very detailed proposal on that and I think we'll continue to have that conversation but I just urge this committee to think very carefully when it's asked him to pass legislation on those issues that it also thinks very hard about sort of what's broken in the current system and does that new idea really fix it rate so I just want to echo that and then also to assembly member Carrillo PC E. has a sustainable workforce policy that our understanding is it's one of the strongest ones available we have done over three hundred megawatts of solar power plant development in the state that's led to direct union jobs and I would be happy to share that with you and share our vision of how we develop a sustainable work force across the state were sprinkling our plants around the state so that those benefits spread out they don't just stay in one area so hopefully we can have a chat about that and I can talk to about that thank you thank you and and in a let me think everyone who came out to us here they're inside in their comments we appreciate the panelists because they certainly brought us some focus to our conversation and it was really important that we have this -- this hearing as I said at the beginning of before we got into the bill's making their way to this committee so that we can hear from all of you in a way that helps and former thinking and gives a some clarity in terms of some of the ways that we can move forward in a -- an appropriate way and one that's going to build on our system so that it is reliable so that is affordable and that we are moving smartly to our region are or carbon reduction goals of you know the the it says look at said all the time the eyes of the world are watching California and and certainly that's heightened now because of the instability in our -- investor owned utilities -- but we will get through that and we will create we will see ourselves on the other side but the question now is what is that look like what they see a growth of CCA's and wanting to see that there's a ability to foster opportunities for our the -- distributed energy resource community and developers there's still has to be a balance that has to take place here and we want to find ourselves in a place where are we're not back in the late nineteen nineties and two thousands where a resource adequacy becomes the issue again that will as Mr Paterson point now create a lot of anxiety and fear amongst everyone so we want to make sure we're putting forth good policies and we're putting forth policies that make sense of their pieces of the puzzle we acknowledge all the time especially with this committee there are a lot of pieces to the puzzle that are on the table sometimes you feel they're just scattered all over the table you're trying to force one piece and just because it looks like it should fit the right color you remember those puzzles are your kids a ten thousand pieces and you're trying to make him all come together and yet do you have to be smart about how you wind it up because just because it looks like it's supposed to work doesn't necessarily mean it's meant to work so we're going to do our our very best to to navigate through of the issues that are in front of us I think this state is done great work -- to lay out a clear vision of how we can move forward -- but we do have some central questions about the future of natural gas is an example and how of that is going to work for it and there are those who think we need to tomorrow be often there others it's a well that's going to take awhile in this transition -- or should hell was have a reserve and there are questions about the come to mind around of the city of Los Angeles -- -- looking to close down a couple of gas plants in in that community and how of the communities going to properly -- their of their needs are gonna be met without rates going up so it's a balancing act -- but we were looking forward to working with all of you you're all familiar faces to this committee and so will -- look forward to hearing your thoughts as we move forward but I'm glad you're able to join us today I think it was a very informative conversation and we look forward to you joining us once we -- start the role of real me a real bills to process so thank you very much we're adjourned
