I'M LIKE A LOT OF IT WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS AND COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES WE HAVE BEEN. IN SUPPORT OF UP. THIS EFFORT FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS I BELIEVE. THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED WITH THESE BALLOONS OF FIRES AS WELL AS RISK TO OUR EMPLOYEES THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS IN OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS WE'VE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF SPOT FIRES AND VEGETATION FIRES. IN LAKE ELSINORE PARIS. MEANT AN OUTAGE AND. TORRANCE RENTALS PALS BURDENS AREA THAT REALLY HEIGHTENS THE NEED FOR NOT ONLY EDUCATION WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING. OUR EDUCATION TO OUR SERVICE TERRITORY MEMBERS THAT BEGINS PRETTY MUCH AROUND THIS TIME OF YEAR GOES THROUGH THE FALL AS ALL THE KEY HOLIDAYS OF MEMORIAL DAY FOURTH OF JULY LABOR DAY. GRADUATIONS. EVEN FEDERAL REUNIONS AND WEDDINGS AND SO KNOWING THAT THIS ISSUE IS A IS A IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR US FROM A SAFETY IN A PUBLIC SAFETY ASPECT.

AB MARK I'M HALF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POWER AUTHORITY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. CNN ANY WITNESSES OR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM CAN MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN. I THINK YOU AND ONE OF THE MY YOUR TENACITY MISTER QUIRK BRINGING THIS BILL BACK IN DIFFERENT ITERATIONS TIME AFTER TIME. SO. SO DID THE OPPOSITION I MEAN WAS IT JUST YOUR. FANTASTIC NEGOTIATION POWERS THAT HASN'T NOT ALL MY BALLOON PEOPLE CALLING ME THIS TIME WHEN THIS BILL COMES FORWARD OR HAS THE INDUSTRY. ACKNOWLEDGES A BIGGER PROBLEM ARE WILLING TO.% TO HAVE TO COMPROMISE I'M JUST FANTASTIC. I WOULD CONCUR. FANTASTIC. AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. LIKE THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE DOCTOR BURKE THE BILL. WOULD. BAN THE MANUFACTURE. BALLOONS HERE NOT THE CONSUMPTION OF THE BALLOONS AND NOT THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF THE BALLOONS. I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW MANY WHAT WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE AND BANNING MANUFACTURING NOT THE OTHER AVENUES THE DISTRIBUTION AND HOW MANY OF THESE BONDS ARE ACTUALLY MANUFACTURED IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE ISSUE FOR GOING WITH THE MANUFACTURERS IS THAT TYPICALLY THE DOLLAR STORES DON'T DO ANYTHING. SO THERE IS A REQUIREMENT WHICH. A DOCTOR EGGMAN THIS. THE MAYOR FOR TOWN. WILL MAKE SURE THAT SHE'S GOT THESE WEIGHTS ATTACHED THE BALLOONS. HE GO THE SAFE WHERE THE DOLLAR STORE THEY DON'T BOTHER. AND SO WE THINK IT'S A LOST CAUSE TO WORK WITH THE RETAILERS. AND WE'RE HOPING WE CAN GET THE MANUFACTURES TO DO THIS IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS A CALIFORNIA PROBLEMS IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM. BUT WE DON'T HAVE. A NATIONAL CONGRESS ANYMORE THAT PASSES FAILS SO. WE JUST HAVE TO DO OUR BEST IN CALIFORNIA DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON HOW MANY OF THESE BALLOONS ARE ACTUALLY MANUFACTURED IN CALIFORNIA. THOUGHT SOMEONE MIGHT. OKAY SO CURRENT MANUFACTURERS IN THE U. S. SO THERE'S NO BAND BY THE WAY. WHAT HAPPENS IS? CURRENT. MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA OR ANY HAVE IT. THE PROBLEM IS. IT BALLOONS COMING IN FROM CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. BUT THERE'S NO I TRY TO BAN BEFORE WHICH I THINK MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. BUT THAT BALLOON LOBBY YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM. NOT WERE TALK ABOUT THAT THE WARNING LABEL RIGHT YEAH THIS MORNING IS LIKE THIS BILL REQUIRES A MORNING YEAH REQUIRES SOME NOISE. YOU FACTORED IN CALIFORNIA SUCH WIVES CURIOUS ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW. HOW MANY OF THESE BONDS ARE ACTUALLY MADE HERE SO IT SOUNDS LIKE? A FAIR NUMBER. ALRIGHT WHAT WE TAKE UP ENOUGH TIME WE CAN LOOK AT OR ABOUT THE CHILD THOU TRYING GET NANCY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ABSOLUTELY ASSEMBLY WOMAN BAKER THANK YOU I HAVE SIR A SIMILAR QUESTION WHICH IS YEAH APOLOGIZE I CAME A BIT LATE YOU MAY HAVE COVERED THIS ALREADY. IF THEY ARE MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WILL THEY BE TREATED THE SAME WAY AS MANUFACTURERS INSIDE CALIFORNIA OR ARE THEY TREATED DIFFERENTLY UNDER THE SPELL BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY UNDER THE SPELL. CHECKING. THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER WHEN WE CAN YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S TO MANUFACTURES A BALLOON IN THE STATE IT IS. A PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE STATE. IF THE PROBLEM YEAH IT'S MY PEOPLE THAT'S I DON'T TRY TO DO INTERSTATE COMMERCE. SO WE'RE TREATING WERE ONLY ADDRESS IN OUR CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS BUT OTHERS WHO MANUFACTURE THEM ELSEWHERE WILL NOT HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT AND THAT'S A PROBLEM. I AGREE THANK YOU ARE YOU NOW I'VE TRIED OTHER THINGS AND GOVERNOR VETOES. OR WHATEVER SO. WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CAN.

AND UNDER CURRENT REGULATIONS THERE IS A CANNABIS EVENT LICENSE AND ME AND CAMPUS EVENTS MAY ONLY BE HELD BY PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN ISSUED A CAMPUS EVENTS ORGANIZER LICENSE BUT THIS LICENSE TYPE IS INTENDED FOR THE LARGE SCALE. SALES IN CONSUMPTION EVENTS AND THAT YOU SEE ON COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS SUCH AS THE HIGH TENS OF AND HERE IS OUR COMMON OVER THE WEEKEND.

MISTER LACKEY MISTER BONTA. BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO START UP A SCENE THAT WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH WOULD ALLOW. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER RESORTING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL TAXES PRIOR TO JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WAS BILL SCHEDULED TO SUNSET IF WE ARE NOT MEETING THE ANNUAL REVENUES TO ADEQUATELY IN FUND AT AGENCY COSTS AS WELL AS PROGRAMS ENVISIONED UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR. MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY. AND I AM I'M. NOT MY NOT SO YOU UNDERSTAND OKAY OKAY. NOW HAVE WORKED CLOSELY THE CATHOLIC. AS FELLOW. PHILIP JOINT AUTHORS OF THE MEDICAL CANNABIS RATE THAT BIG STATE REGULATORY SAFETY ACT. WE ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WOULD. COOLEY JONES SAWYER LACKEY BONTA. HAVE BELIEVE IN CALIFORNIA WERE CANNABIS. LAWS. PROTECT THAT THE PUBLIC IN CHILDREN PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT INSURE SAFE PRODUCTS AND COME BACK THE ILLEGAL THE ILLICIT MARKET. IN RESPONSE THE ILLICIT MARKET WE NEED TO. WE NEED TO PASS THIRTY AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY SEVEN WHICH WILL CREATE A THREE YEAR WINDOW TO TRANSITION CONSUMERS FROM THE ILLEGAL CANNABIS SO SELLERS OF CANNABIS. TO LAWFULLY REGULATED MARKETPLACE LET'S BE CLEAR CALIFORNIA'S REGULATED CANNABIS MARKETPLACE IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY. THEIR SIGNIFICANT START UP COSTS FACING THE GOOD ACTORS THOSE BUSINESSES THAT WANT TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND DO BUSINESS THE RIGHT WAY. THIS GOODNESS IS GOOD BUSINESS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE AGAINST ILLICIT MARKET IF THEY CANNOT BE COMPETITIVE ON PRICE. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY LEVELS AN ESTIMATED FORTY FIVE PERCENT TAX ON COMPLIANT ACTORS. WE'VE SEEN THE STRATEGY OF OF TEMPORALLY DRIVE TEMPORARILY TILING BACK CERTAIN TAXES. THEY ACTUALLY PAY HUGE DIVIDENDS IN THE FORM OF HIGHER TAX REVENUES IN THE LONG RUN. BOTH OREGON AND WASHINGTON OF SIMPLIFIED TO REDUCE THEIR TAX RATES AND HAVE SEEN TACK THIS STATE TAX REVENUE INCREASE AS BUSINESSES PROSPER. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WASHINGTON LOWERED ITS TAXES WITHIN A JUST A FEW MONTHS OF LEGALIZATION. REVENUE GREW FROM THIRTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO THIRTY THREE MILLION IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. ONCE THE LEGAL MARKET PLACES ESTABLISH ITS ROOTS NO PUN INTENDED. THE TAX RATES WILL RETURNS THE PRESCRIBED LEVELS. SET IN PROP SIXTY FOUR AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY SEVEN IS IMPORTANT STEP TO ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT LEGITIMATE TAXPAYING BUSINESSES.

WHO DOES NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL BUT CAN PRIDE TECHNICAL IS THIS ASSISTANCE ON THE CALIFORNIA CAMPUS MARKET? THANK YOU FOR YOUR. INDULGENCE. THE CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN DOCTOR WOULD FOR SCORING ON OVER HERE AND I PRESENTING THIS IN ACCOMMODATING THIS COMMITTEE WILL POTS FOR JUST ONE MOMENT TO SUBSEQUENTLY SECRET. LOW HERE. BRO. ARAMBULA. BAKER. LITTLE. CHEN. CHIU. CUNNINGHAM. EGGMAN FONG. GIPSON. GRAYSON. HOLDEN. IRWIN. MEDINA. MULLIN. OBERNOLTE. TING. IT AGAIN JUST MEMBERS NOW THAT THE MATCH NUMBERS TEN AT A GIVEN THE ARE OF WONDERFUL ADDITIONS TO THIS COMMITTEE. PLEASE. YOU MY FRIENDS ABERNATHY FROM. WE ARE FREE GROUP BENT THERE ARE FEW MARKET RESEARCH. CALIFORNIA IS NOT LIKE MOST OF THE STATES THAT WE'VE SEEN. COME ONLINE WITH. ADULT USE. SO FAR. WE HAVE BY FAR THE MOST SOPHISTICATED. ILLICIT MARKET IN THE COUNTRY. WE. DEALT WITH. VERY LOOSE REGULATIONS FOR TWENTY YEARS AND BUSINESSES THAT WERE. LEGAL UNDER. THAT THE LOOSE MEDICAL REGULATIONS PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE. OF MANY OF THEM ARE NOW ON THE LIST SIDE OF THE BUSINESS SO WHEN WE LOOK AT. WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT DISPENSARIES COMPETING WITH? JUST YOU KNOW THAT ROOMMATE FROM COLLEGE OR THAT DAY SHADY STREET DEALER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT. LICENSED REGULATED BUSINESSES COMPETING WITH. AND MANY CASES SHOPS THAT TO THE CONSUMER LOOK. VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THOSE LICENSED AND REGULATED BUSINESSES DELIVERY SERVICES THAT LOOK AND FEEL. LIKE LICENSE IN REGULATED BUSINESSES. I'VE BEEN TO MANY OF THESE PLACES SINCE JANUARY ONE AND. THE ONLY INDICATION THAT YOU'D HAVE THAT. OF THESE PLACES ARE IN BACK NOT LICENSED AND REGULATED IS LOOKING AT. THE PRICE THAT YOU PAY WHEN YOU WALK OUT THE DOOR AND THE LACK OF. TAXES BEING COLLECTED. WELL THAT OVERALL DEMAND FOR CANNABIS IS RELATIVELY INELASTIC. WHEN YOU LOOK AT MARKETS THAT HAVE BOTH. LEGAL AND ILLICIT CHANNELS FOR ACQUISITION. THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF PRICE ELASTICITY. SO AS THE PRICE GOES UP IN LEGAL CHANNELS IT FORCES MORE AND MORE OF THE BUSINESS AT TWO. A. ILLEGAL CHANNELS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE THE WHOLESALE TAX. OF NINE THAT NINE DOLLARS INCLUDING FIVE CENTS PER OUNCE. IT'S ONE THING TO SAY NINE DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS PER OUNCE BUT THAT HAPPENS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUPPLY CHEN AND THAT TAX GETS COMPOUNDED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. DOWN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AS DIFFERENT PARTIES I'D TAKE THEIR MARGINS AND AS A. TAXES GET LEVY. SO ULTIMATELY BETWEEN. THE THE NINE. TWENTY FIVE. PER OUNCE TAX AND THE ADDITIONAL COST OF TESTING CANNABIS. THAT. REAL ESTATE ARTS ARE THAT THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX. AS WAS CALIFORNIA SALES TAX. AND THE ADDITIONAL NEED FOR A DISTRIBUTOR TO POLL MARGIN. WE'RE LOOKING AT A A SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT PREMIUM. UNKEPT. WITH THAT WHAT ONE MINUTE LEFT. I'M ON CANVASES PURCHASED THROUGH A. LICENSED AND REGULATED DISPENSARIES. THAT GOES UP DRAMATICALLY IS THE PULSE UP PRICES CANNABIS GOES DOWN THOSE CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON A FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR POUND PRICE FOR CANNABIS. AND IT'S A VERY. IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT WE'LL SEE SUB SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR POUND. CANNABIS OF THIS THIS BURDEN REALLY DOES MAKE IT A VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR. FOR LEGAL. BUSINESSES AND SET A CALIFORNIA TO COMPETE. WE'LL SEE SOME GROWTH. WHETHER OR NOT THIS BILL PASSES BUT WE'LL SEE A LOT MORE GROWTH. IF IT DOESN'T WAS TO EXPECTING A. WE EXPECT TWENTY NINE PERCENT. AS IS A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. IF WE COULD SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND COLORADO'S GROWTH RATE IN ITS FIRST THREE YEARS OF ADULT USE. WE WOULD SEE A ATTEMPT POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR MARKET IN TWENTY TWO ANYWAY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK EDITION ALL COMMENTS IT JUST DOESN'T NEED TO. YES I'LL BE BRIEF AS CHAIRMAN LOW MEMBERS A MEETING CAN SOMEBODY HAVE OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THIS IS OUR OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BILL.

TABLE AND WILL ALLOW UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SPEAK WHATEVER READY. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COMMITTEE MY NAME'S GOING ABOUT THIS AND I REPRESENT DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO. REDUCING THE HARMS RELATED WITH DRUGS TO DRUGS AND HARMS RELATE PROHIBITION AND IT'S INCARCERATIONS. RELATED TO DRUG USE. OUR SEE FOR PARTNER. DRUG POLICY ACTION WAS THE SECOND LARGEST DONOR TO PROP SIXTY FOUR AND WE WERE PARTICIPATED IN THE DRAFTING OF PROP FIFTY. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS MEASURE THAT WE GREATLY RESPECT THE AUTHORS. WE HAVE PROPOSES MEASURES PREMATURE. THE BALLOT MEASURE WAS DISCUSSED DEBATED AND ANALYZED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE LA NO OUR OWN STATE LA NO. DID AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE TAXES MEANT WHAT THE MARKET WOULD BEAR WHAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE MARKET. THEY SPOKE TO NUMEROUS EXPERTS HAD AT INDEPENDENT NOT INDUSTRY RELATED BUT INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS. DOPPLER ALICE'S NEAR ALICE'S WAS THAT WHEN THE MARKET WAS MATURE THIS WOULD BRING IN UPWARDS OF A BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE. IN STATE AND LOCAL REVENUE. ALSO IN THE ACT. WE MANDATE THAT THE LA I'LL DO ANOTHER ANALYSIS BASED ON THE FIRST YEAR HALF OR SO. OF THE CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE. AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW TO ADJUST THE TAX. AND IN THE ACT IT SAYS VERY CLEARLY. THAT THESE ARE THE MEASURES FOR DECIDING THAT. HOW TO UNDERCUT THE BLACK MARKET? HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCT IS NOT ATTRACTIVE TO MINORS? AND PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY ONE. AND TO MAKE SURE THE REVENUE COMES IN FOR THE THINGS THAT THE VOTERS MANDATED. THE VOTERS ALSO HAD A VIOLENT TWENTY SIXTEEN AS DID THE LA ELLEN. THE PRESSING WAS DEBATED. WHAT WOULD THE MONEY BE SPENT ON SO THE MONEY IS EARMARKED FOR REGULATION AS YOU KNOW? INVESTMENT IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY THE DRUG WAR INVESTMENT IN DRUG TREATMENT FOR YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS. INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION AND. PROTECTION. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PUBLIC SAFETY. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS. EARLY ACTION SUPPORTED BY THE INDUSTRY NOT SURPRISING THAT EVERY INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEIR TAXES CUT. THE SONGS WERE ABOUT THE INDUSTRY OUR CONCERNS ARE WHAT FUTURE WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA AND THAT'S THE JOB OF THE ONLY. TO COLLECT THAT DATA AND GIVE ASIDE ANALYSIS. AND WE'RE CONCERNED THERE'S POTENTIAL DANGERS. THE CHOICE OF HIGH TAXES COMES FROM OUR EXPERIENCE OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO. THE RESEARCH ON ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO IS CLEAR. YOU KEEP THE PRICES ARTIFICIALLY HIGH. SO IT'S LESS ATTRACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT'S TRUE FOR BEER IT'S RIVER LECTER EXTRA FOR CIGARETTES SURLY CIGARETTES ARE FAR MORE TAXING CANNABIS. BUT WE DO THAT FOR A REASON. NOT MAINLY AND PRIMARILY REVENUE. IT'S TO DETER YOUNG PEOPLE THE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DO RESPOND TO PRICE TAG. PRICES GO UP YOUNG PEOPLE LESS LIKELY CONSUME. I MAKE WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO SPEAK. BUT. TEN SECONDS LEFT. TEN SECONDS ROBERT. THE BILL. MY NAME IS ROBERT HARRIS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. WHO TOOK PART THEN TO PAST PRESIDENTS LED THAT NEWSOME TASK FORCE WHAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT? AND. THEY HAD HIM PUT MATT NEVER LANGUAGES FOR THAT THE IN THE TREATMENT LANGUAGE OF THE INITIATIVE WE THINK IT'S TOTALLY PREMATURE TO DO THIS WE THINK IT COULD HAVE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF WHAT. THE SPECULATIVE AND THESE ARE SPECULATIVE PER. IDEAS OF MORE MORE REVENUE IT'S KIND LIKE IF TO USE CAR EIGHT ZERO AND I'M A FEW. MONTHS OKAY DOT OF THAT'S A MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SINGLE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. YEAH DOT ORG. I THINK THAT AND NUMBER CAN BE A LONG MILE AND A QUESTION I KNOW YOU'RE PINCHING TODAY MISTER DOCTOR WOULD. UP BUT THIS IDEA OF OF PRE MATURITY. THE MAY REVISE BECOMING OUT WE WILL SEE WHAT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS ARE WHAT WHY THE RUSH. WELL I THINK I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE ACTUAL NUMBER TO REVENUE NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY LOWER SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN PROJECTED AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE IS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE TAX BURDEN ITSELF. THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE INDUSTRY I THINK TO GET STARTED AND. THE LICENSE FEES ARE VERY HIGH. LOCAL LOCALS HAVE ADDED ON TAXES AS WELL WITH THE YOUR COUNTIES OR CITIES. SO YOU'VE TAKEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE THAT ARE PAIN AND I DON'T THINK IT IS THE MISTER LACKEYS NOTES HERE NINE EXAGGERATION FORTY FIVE PERCENT TAX BURDEN. ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT THESE BUSINESSES CANNOT DEDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS EXPENSES LIKE. WAGES UTILITIES BECAUSE OF A FEDERAL TAX CALL CALLED TO EIGHTY E.. DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT OUR STATE FOLLOWS THAT AS WELL SO THE TAX BURDEN IS ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. AND I THINK THAT SOME PLAYERS IN THE IN THE IN THE MARKET ARE JUST SIMPLY SAYING. WELL I'M I'M JUST I'M JUST NOT READY TO GO THERE YET AND SO WE ARE NOT SEEN THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES COME FORWARD I BELIEVE THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GOING TO AND WE'RE NOT SEEING THE REVENUE COMING IN FOR THE TAXES AND SO. SO I WOULD AGREE WITH MISTER BACCHUS THAT THAT THAT THE IDEA WAS THAT AT A POINT WE WOULD HAVE A ROBUST MARKET WITH A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN TAX REVENUE. BUT I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAN THE ACTUAL NUMBERS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ARE WOEFULLY. WOEFULLY BELOW THE PROJECTIONS AND I THINK THAT'S A CHALLENGE AND SO WHEN THE LEDGE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. WE WERE ACTUALLY. WORKING ON ON TAX NUMBERS. AND ADDS THAT WAS WORKING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THOSE NUMBERS WERE ACTUALLY LOWER THAN WHAT IS IN THE INITIATIVE NOW. AND. BECAUSE WE LEARNED I THINK WE LEARNED. FROM THE INDUSTRY. AND THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE BALANCE. REPEAL THE TAX REVENUE IN THE TAX BURDEN SO. THAT'S THAT IS. THAT IS HOW I SEE IT I DON'T I. YOU KNOW IN A PERFECT WORLD IT WOULD IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE HAD HAD THE ABILITY AS A AS A AS A BODY TO ESTABLISH THE REVENUE THAT THE. THE OF THE ACTUAL ATTACKS LEVELS BUT WE DON'T AND THAT'S PART OF THE STATUTE ITSELF. BUT I AS I DON'T THINK ITS REPORT PREMATURE. IF WE WANT IF WE IF OF OUR GOAL AND THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AS AUTHORS. IS TO COME BACK THE ILLICIT MARKET BRING EVERYBODY TO REGULATE ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE TO MAKE IT FAIR. AND I THINK THAT. FORTY FIVE PERCENT IS PRETTY TOUGH ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT YOU NOW HAVE. THE INABILITY TO DEDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS EXPENSES AT A FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL THE TAX BURDEN. IT GOES WAY BEYOND FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF THAT POINT. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT WAS. TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WITH THE INITIATIVE. I I THINK THAT. DID THE VOTERS SUPPORTED. I. IT WAS A SIXTY FOUR PAGE INITIATIVE THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THERE I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC CLEARLY WANTED. THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES DECRIMINALIZATION THE ABILITY FOR ADULT USE I THINK PEOPLE REALIZE THAT WAS A LIE DETAIL IN THAT IN THAT INITIATIVE AND. YOU KNOW. I. I. DID YOU ALL READ THE SIXTY FOUR PAGES. I DON'T BELIEVE PEOPLE DEAD SOUTH AND AND SO I THINK IT'S I THINK PART OF OUR JOB IS A LEGISLATURE'S TO HELP. HELP IMPLEMENT THINKS I BELIEVE THIS ACTUALLY WILL IN TIME. ALLOW US TO GET TO A POINT WILL WE WILL BE ABLE TO REALIZE THAT BILLION DOLLARS. BUT WE NEED TO DO IT AND OUT IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY THINK. AND IF THEN IF THE NUMBERS COME OUT I MAY REVISE THAT ARE THAT ARE CLOSER TO PROJECTION. THEN I'D BE SURPRISED. LOW WILL THE BILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. WELL I AND THE THIRD. PICK ON THE PINCH HITTER THAT CAN YOU. I GOT BETTER MIGHT ASK HIM BUT. BUT BUT I WITH. IT AND IF I IF I MIGHT. DOCTOR EDMUND FOR THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A SUMMER BONTA PRESENT THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT. DID DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL MIGHT BE PREMATURE A GIVEN THE TIMING AND THE UNCERTAINTY GIVEN SOME OF THE PROJECTIONS AND SO PERHAPS YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE DOCTOR IT MEANS QUESTIONS AND GIVING. ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION. YEAH I THINK U. CELLO THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD AFTER STEP IN AND IT THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN AND AND THE WHOLE. COMMITTEE FREE FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR ENGAGE IN ON US. AS THE ISSUE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR IBUT WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED FOR WAS A LEGALIZED REGULATED MARKET. AND IT'S EITHER A LOT OF. ASSUMPTIONS THAT THAT WENT INTO WHAT KIND OF REVENUE WOULD COME OUT AT IT WHAT THAT IT MIGRATION FROM THAT. ILLICIT MARKET THE BLACK AND GREY MARKET THE LEGACY MARKET AS SOME PEOPLE CALL IT TO THAT REGULATED MARKET WOULD BE. AND WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. AND YOU'RE ONE IS SO CRITICAL FOR FOR THE TRANSITION WERE WERE JUST IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF ARE REGULATED MARKET AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS MANY. INDUSTRY MEMBERS ARE MOVING OVER TO TO THE REGULATED MARKET BEING CALIFORNIA BUSINESS LIKE ANY OTHER BUSINESS PAYING THEIR TAXES CREATING GOOD JOBS. AND IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING. AND. SORT OF COUNTER INTUITIVELY IF YOU LOWER THE TAX RATE. YOU CAN INCREASE THE TAX REVENUE AND THAT'S NOT JUST A HYPOTHETICAL ACADEMIC. PROPOSITION THAT'S WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IN THE STATE OF OREGON. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HAVE TO BE A WIN WIN IN THAT IT CAN GENERATE MORE REVENUE BY LOWER THE TAX RATE AND HAVING MORE TAX PAYERS COME OVER. TO THE REGULATED MARKET NUMBER ONE. AND. NUMBER TO HELPING ROUTE OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THAT THAT ILLICIT MARKET. AT WHICH WHICH UNDERCUTS THE REGULATED MARKET AND HELPS GIVE THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA WHAT THEY WANTED LEGAL REGULATED MARKET SO I MEAN IS IS. IS A LOT OF THIS. YOU KNOW. OUR WORD WHAT WORD TRYING TO DO WITH THE BEST INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE YES IS IT IS IT A GUARANTEED EXACT SCIENCE I CAN PROMISE YOU. IT IT'S OCCURRING EXACTLY THAT VOTE THE WAY WERE SAYING. I DIDN'T KNOW I WE DO THAT ALL THE TIME THAT WITH OUR BILLS WE TRIED IT WITH THEM WITH INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE WE TRY TO CREATE THE BEST POLICY. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST TO BE NIMBLE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING OR IN THIS CASE NOT HAPPENING WHICH IS. NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE MOVING OVER TO THE RATED MARKETPLACE SO WE THINK THIS IS A A A. A PRO. LEGALIZED AND REGULATED REGIME BILL THAT CAN ACTUALLY GENERATE MORE REVENUE BUT WERE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT. YOU KNOW IT IT. TRY TRY TO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REVENUE IS. BOB AT AND WHERE IT'S GOING AND AND AND TO THE PEOPLE THAT IT IT SUPPORTING THAT THEY'VE REMAIN WHOLE THIS IS NOT. AT ALL AND AN ATTEMPT TO DEPRIVE ANYONE OF REVENUE THAT THEY SOUGHT THE RIGHT NOW THE REVENUE THEY EXPECTED. IS IS NOT HAPPENING I IS NOT COMING AND WE THINK IT IT'S MORE LIKELY TO WITH THIS PROPOSAL. GOOD TO THE QUESTION WHAT AGAIN THOUGH IF IF. IF AFTER THAT MAYBE IF IT LOOKS LIKE THINGS ARE NOT AS NOT AS DIRE AS YOU'RE YOU'RE SUGGESTING. WILL THE BILL CONTINUE MOVE FORWARD. IT I AM I THINK WE HAVE TO BE OPEN TO NEW INFORMATION BUT EFFORT COME WHATEVER MAY BE IF IF WE SEE IN MAY THAT. REVENUES ARE STRONG AND ILLICIT MARKET IS IS IS SHRINKING AT A RATE THAT'S THAT THAT IS. CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE. AND THAT ARE BILL THIS IS NO LONGER NECESSARY OF OF COURSE THAT NEW INFORMATION WILL BE RELEVANT TO WHAT WE DO WITH THE BILL GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A MEMBER CHAD. THANK YOU MISTER THIS QUESTIONS US FOR THE OPPOSITION. AND MY QUESTIONS THEIR OF ID CHECKS. RIGHT NOW WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR ILLICIT SELLERS. IF THE AREA IN WHICH THERE INTEREST IN AREAS LIKE THERE'S A. A MINOR. WOULD HAVE ID CHECKS. DO IF ANY RIGHT NOW ARE CURRENTLY. THE PRESENT. THE BALLOT MEASURE PROVIDES FOR REVENUE FOR REGULATION ACROSS THE NUMBER OF SECTORS IN THOSE INCLUDE EXPLICITLY THAT WE WANT IT IN THE BALLOT MEASURE THE SIXTY FOUR PAGES THAT WERE MENTIONED INCLUDE. DO THE SAME THING WE DO FOR ALCOHOL WHICH IS CENTERED UNDER AGE. THE UNDER TWENTY ONE PERSON INTO A SPACE TO SEE IF THEY CAN PURCHASE THAT THEY CAN THEN. SHOT THAT PROGRAM DOWN OR NOT PENALIZE AT THAT PROGRAM. I LIVE ILLICIT SELLERS. ARV SHOULD BE SET ESPECIALLY THEY'RE TRYING TO RUN A STOREFRONT OR DELIVERY SUBJECT TOO MANY LEVELS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND INCLUDING THE ID CHECK IF THEY'RE TRYING TO PRETEND TO BE A REAL SHOP AND THEY CHECK ID BUT THEY DON'T COLLECT TAXES FOR CALIFORNIA. TASTY SHUT DOWN WHEN THINGS ARE PROP SIXTY FOURS IT RAISES THE MONEY FOR ENFORCEMENT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY FUNCTIONS AND IT'S NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO FISHING GAME. AND THE INDUSTRY TO DO WHAT YOU JUST MENTIONED CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE MINERS AREN'T IN THOSE STORES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS AT THIS TIME ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU TO A CHAIR AND. IF I A AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION I JUST ABOUT FOR SECOND BUT I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION OVER THE REVENUE AND. WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO GET ENOUGH TO COME IN OR NOT REALLY FOR ME THE ISSUE WAS MORE ABOUT. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATE A PATHWAY FOR THE UNREGULATED TO GET INTO THE REGULATED WELL FIELD AND AND FOR ME. IF IT MEANS REDUCING TAXES BECAUSE THE POINT WAS MADE A DOCTOR WITH THAT YOU MADE. THAT. LOCALS ARE TAXING THIS AS WELL AND IN SOME CASES EXORBITANTLY. TO THE POINT THAT IT'S ALMOST INCENTIVE TO NOT GET INVOLVED OR TO NOT BE AND GET INTO THE REGULAR A REGULATORY FIELD SO. FOR ME IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE AND BRING EVERYONE IN AND REALLY HIT THEM THE BLACK MARKET OR THE UNDER MARKET REALLY HARD. AND SO OF REVENUE THAT'S ONE THING. THAT COMES AND. MORE IMPORTANT FOR ME IS THE SAFETY. AND THE BIGGER THE BLACK MARKET THE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE WE HAVE EXPOSED. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT CHECKING ID'S. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT PAYING ANY TAXES SO SOME TO ME IS BETTER THAN NONE. AND SO FOR ME I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL SIMPLY FOR THE FACT THAT IT HELPS INVITE AND CREATE A PATHWAY FOR FOLKS TO COME INTO THE REGULATORY. A WORLD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS A COMMENT AT THIS TIME. AS SEEN NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMUNITIES AT THIS TIME. TO THE AUTHORS SEE WISH TO CLOSE JUST TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION YOUR ENGAGEMENT OR QUESTIONS AND AND DOT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE THE WORKING WITH THE CHAMPIONS. IF YOU CAN SEE MEMBERS LACKEY BONTA COOLEY JOINTS OR AND DOCTOR WOULD ARE. LISTED AS CO AUTHORS OF THIS MEASURE AND I. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU A MEMBERS I'D HAVE SOME. A SIGNIFICANT. RESERVATIONS WITH THIS BILL ABOVE FOR US. BUT IT DOES ENJOY DO A PASS RECOMMENDATION ON TELL YOU WHY WITH HIS PERSPECTIVE SOME RESERVATIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT WE ARE JUST SIMPLY BUT FIVE MONTHS INTO THE LEGALIZATION OF THIS INDUSTRY. AND OF THERE ARE A LOT OF VARYING MOVING PIECES AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE ACTION TO IDENTIFY OF THE ISSUES AT HAND IN THE INFANCY OF RECOGNIZING THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE WHAT CAN WE DO WHAT MECHANISMS TO HAVE IN PLACE. A TO GET RID OF THE BLACK MARKET A MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION AS WE ALL KNOW IN THE PROPOSITION WAS A TOUTING THE. SIGNIFICANT REVENUES COMING FROM LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS AND SO THAT IS VERY COMPELLING TO ME. AND FOR US TO THEN THINK ABOUT ABOUT REDUCING THE TAX RATE. WITH JUST BUT FIVE MONTHS IN WHEN IT WAS PROPOSED TO THE ELECTORATE A TO BE OF THIS SIGNIFICANT REVENUE STREAM YEAH IS A SOMEWHAT CAUSES. SOME SOME SIGNIFICANT PAUSE. AT THE SAME TIME. I HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH A OF THE AUTHORS. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS TO IDENTIFY THE INTENT WHICH IS THAT OF. GETTING. ACTORS GOOD ACTORS INTO THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE AND HOW DO WE IDENTIFY THAT OF THE BLACK MARKET. A MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION SHOULD ALSO BE WITH RESPECT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ENSURING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES THEIR JOB. AND IT IS BEEN. THE OBSERVATION THAT THE THERE IT AND INADEQUATELY. EQUIPPED AND TO DO HOMES OF THE PRIVATIZATION AND THE REVENUES TO ENFORCE. IT TO THE EXTENT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY SHOULD. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN THERE'S BEEN A COMMITMENT FROM THE AUTHORS ON A BUDGET ASK SPECIFICALLY WITH AYE ENGAGING IN REQUESTING ADDITIONAL REVENUES FOCUSED ON THAT OF LAWN FORSMAN SO WHILE WE HAVE BEFORE US A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IS JUST. NARROWLY TAILORED TO THAT OF THE INDUSTRY I KNOW THAT THERE'S A BIG IN THAT COMMITMENTS OF FROM INDUSTRY AND FROM AUTHORS TO ALSO IDENTIFYING THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. OF THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT WITH A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN PERMITTING AT THERE'S ALSO BEEN ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PIPELINE. A SO THAT WE CAN HAVE OTHER INDIVIDUALS INTO THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE. IT SHOULD BE KNOWN. STATED THOUGH THAT. MEMBERS YOU SHOULD REMEMBER AND RECALL THAT. THE STATE DID A LOAN OF FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP SIXTY FOR CLOSE TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT NEEDS TO BE REPAID. AND GIVEN THAT IT IS THE ASSESSMENTS AND THE PROJECTIONS THAT WE WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER THOSE REVENUES. THERE'D AGAIN CREATE SOME PAUSE WHICH IS THAT OF THE REVENUES PROJECTED THAT WE WILL SEE AND THAT MAY REVISED DO NOT EVEN MEET THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE REPAID. THAT IS IS OF CONCERN. IDEA ELLIE O. PROJECTED THAT WE SAW THAT IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN THAT WE ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE A HUNDRED CENTER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN PROJECTED SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MILLION IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. HOW WE ALL RIGHT TO SPAIN THAT THERE'S NOWHERE CLOSE NEAR TO THAT? AND SO WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS A NEED FOR CHANGE AND BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS NOT GOING TO WORK BUT AGAIN. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT EXISTS AT LEAST FOR SOME PAUSE TO TRY AND IDENTIFY. THE ISSUE AT HAND WHICH IS THAT OF THE BLACK MARKET OF THIS IS JUST ONE TOOL TO ADDRESS AND ACCOMMODATE THESE ISSUES THERE CAN BE SOME NOTED UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT WE BEST BE MINDFUL OF. WHICH IS WHY I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS NOW WHICH IS AGAIN TO TO RESTATE THAT. OF THE AMEND THAT SECTION OF THIS BILL IS TO INCLUDE INTENT LANGUAGE STATING THAT IN THE EVENTS THAT. ANNUAL REVENUES FOR THE ADJUSTED CANNABIS TAX STRUCTURE ARE PROJECTED TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO ADEQUATELY FUND BOTH REASONABLE AGENCY COST AND THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN PROGRAM FUNDING ENVISIONED IN PROP SIXTY FOURTH THE LEGISLATURE SHALL CONSIDER RESTORING. THE ORIGINAL TAX RATE PRIOR TO JUNE ONE TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE SO AGAIN MEMBERS. THERE HAS BEEN CONVERSATION WITH RESPECT TO A RESTORING THE ATTACKS RATING I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE MEASURE FOR US TO CONSIDER AND AGAIN IT IS THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO. ACCOMMODATE AND REVISIT THIS ISSUE AT HAND AND SO GIVEN THE RESERVATIONS AND GIVEN SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES THAT I HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AND AGAIN THE. COMMITMENT AND THE TENACITY OF THE AUTHORS OF THIS DOES ENJOY AND AYE RECOMMENDATION AND WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU ALSO TO DO SO TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. AND ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT A PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS THIS OF THE BLACK MARKET AND SO HAVING SAID THAT. THE MUSIC THEY WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
