CENTER NIELSEN [inaudible]

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:07.432
WELL.

00:31:07.498 --> 00:31:09.701
WORKING ON THIS FOR SOME TIME.

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:13.338
THERE'S BEEN THE MANY YEARS HERE

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:15.173
KIND OF AN ELECTED CLASS BULLIES

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:22.213
AND THEY CAPTION FLOYD.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:30.855
IN MY ROLE.

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:34.459
OPPORTUNITY. TO PARTICIPATE.

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:38.429
IN A FOR MORE FAIR MINDED WAY.

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:39.631
AND WHAT IT WOULD DO IS SET UP

00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:40.798
AN ARBITRATION.

00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:43.568
PROCESS.

00:31:46.104 --> 00:31:48.339
NOW.

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:50.541
THESE GRIEVANCES ARE ROUTINELY

00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:53.278
DENIED.

00:31:53.344 --> 00:31:55.280
SO IT'S ALMOST A MOCKERY.

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:56.547
SAYS THEY HAVE NO OPTIONS OTHER

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:58.149

00:31:58.216 --> 00:32:00.585
BOARD OR THE COURT [inaudible]

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:03.755
AND THAT'S TIME CONSUMING IT

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:07.525
AFFECTS CERTAINLY THE EMPLOYEE.

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:10.795
DOESN'T REALLY HELP THE STATE.

00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:12.096
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:14.132
TO OPTIMIZE THE GRIEVANCE

00:32:14.198 --> 00:32:15.166
ROCESS?

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:18.002
ALLOWING THE EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:21.272
TO REQUEST ARBITRATION.

00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:22.607
AFTER THEY WOULD NOT A BIG IS

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.776
LOST THE NORMAL GRIEVANCE

00:32:24.842 --> 00:32:26.411
PROCESS.

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:27.979
AND THAT'S A KIND OF A NORMAL

00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:29.480
THING IN STATE GOVERNMENT YEP

00:32:29.547 --> 00:32:34.052
EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:35.687
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT.

00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:37.789
ADDITIONALLY THIS ADDS A LOSER

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:40.491
PAY MODEL.

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:45.096
THIS IS A FILTER A CONSCIENCE.

00:32:45.163 --> 00:32:48.032
ON FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS.

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:49.667
AND ALLOWS THE PARTIES AND GIVE

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:51.202
SOME INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO

00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:52.603
SERIOUSLY.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.772
CONSIDER RESOLVING THINGS

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:55.073

THIS BILL OVER THE YEARS.

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:05.483
END OF CHIEFS A MINOR AND THAT I

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.385
THINK SIGNIFICANT.

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:07.985
TECHNICAL CHANGES THAT WOULD

00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:09.921
NARAL [inaudible]

00:33:09.987 --> 00:33:12.924

00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:19.931
OF THIS CONTINUED.

00:33:19.997 --> 00:33:22.433
AND PROTRACTED LITIGATION.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.035
IF THERE'S EVER TO BE A

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:27.638

00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:29.107
AND PARTICULARLY TOGETHER.

WHO ARE SO OFTEN FORGOTTEN?

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:40.385
AND KEEP IN MIND.

00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:42.186
AND THIS IS KIND OF GOING A

00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:42.787
LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM THE BILL

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:46.224
BUT EXPLODED EMPLOYEES OR WHAT I

AND TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY.

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:04.442
AND VERY OFTEN THEY PAY A PRICE.

00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:06.043
VERY OFTEN THEY GET LESS MONEY.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.711
FOR TAKING THAT EXTRA

00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:10.148

CITY THAT THE PERSON WORK FOR

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:08.839
IN PLACE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS.

00:50:08.905 --> 00:50:10.607

COMPLETED.

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:25.215
THE FOR THIS LEGISLATION IS IF

IT IS -- CONSIDERED AND SIGNED

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:29.019
BY THE GOVERNOR.

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:31.855
THE WE WOULD LOSE THAT APPEAL

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:32.589
PROCESS [inaudible]

00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:34.191
SO.

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:37.327
DUE PROCESS RIGHTS ARE FROM

00:51:37.394 --> 00:51:40.130
BEING DAMAGED BY THIS UP --

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:41.932
LEGISLATION.

00:51:41.998 --> 00:51:43.333
INCREASED FINANCIAL RISK ON

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.903
BEHALF OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.271
ENTITIES NOT JUST PLASTER COUNTY.

00:51:48.338 --> 00:51:51.575
THIS IS A COMPLETE NEW PARADIGM

00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:53.343
SHIFT FROM.

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:56.112
WHAT EXISTS NOW TO PUTTING THE

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:58.315
THE SOLE BURDEN ON THE LOCAL

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:01.017
ENTITY?

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:02.385
IT WOULD BE DRAMATIC WHEN YOU

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.387
CONSIDER NOT ONLY THE EXISTING

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:05.922
MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN PAYING

00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:06.990
INTO.

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:08.525
THE ARM.

00:52:08.592 --> 00:52:10.694
CALPERS FOR THIS PROVISION BUT

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.697
ALL OF THE RETIRED MEMBERS OVER

00:52:13.763 --> 00:52:15.699
THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

00:52:15.765 --> 00:52:17.667
IT GOES TO THE ISSUE OF

00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:19.102
SEPARATION OF POWERS THIS

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:20.570
LEGISLATION.

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:21.872
BASICALLY.

00:52:21.938 --> 00:52:24.608
ORDERS THE LOCAL ENTITY TO MAKE

00:52:24.674 --> 00:52:26.109
GOOD.

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:28.578
ON A PROVISION THAT HAS BEEN

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:30.981
TURNED DETERMINED BY CALPERS.

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:33.683
SHOULD BE DISALLOWED BALL.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:37.287
SO IT IT AFFECTS IT'S IT'S NOT

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:39.089
ONLY ADDRESSES THE GOES TO THE

00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:42.292
ISSUE OF GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS.

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:44.294
BUT IT GOES TO THE ISSUE OF

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:46.329
ACTUALLY ORDERING A PUBLIC

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:47.864
ENTITY TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:49.032
AND MAKE GOOD.

00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:52.435
BASED SOLELY ON THE DECISION OF

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.204
CALPERS SO [inaudible]

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:56.706
COM.

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:58.875
THE PROBLEM HERE.

00:52:58.942 --> 00:52:59.976
IS THAT.

00:53:00.043 --> 00:53:02.445
OVER THE YEARS AN INTERPRETATION

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:04.714
BY CALPERS.

00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:06.783
CHANGES THEY WILL SAY OF THIS IS

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:09.119
GOOD AND THEN TWENTY YEARS LATER

00:53:09.185 --> 00:53:11.454
THEY'LL SAY THIS IS BAD.

00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:13.990
AND IF NOTHING HAS CHANGED NO

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:16.393
RULES HAVE CHANGED HOW IT HOW IS

00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:36.339
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING GOOD

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:39.309
ON A DETERMINATION BY CALPERS.

00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:41.744
BASED ON A NEW INTERPRETATION.

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:43.746
OF OF OF THEIR LONGEVITY

00:59:43.813 --> 00:59:46.082
PROVISION THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:59:46.149 --> 00:59:47.951
IT'S NOT GOOD NOW WHY ALL OF A

00:59:48.017 --> 00:59:48.518
SUDDEN ARE THERE NEW

00:59:48.584 --> 00:59:50.720
INTERPRETATIONS WELL MAYBE IT'S

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:52.922
BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING. FOR FOR

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:53.156
MONEY.

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:56.826
MAYBE THAT IS WHAT WHAT'S GOING

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:57.660
ON THE PROCESS IS.

00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:59.662
WHEN SOMEONE RETIRES ALTHOUGH

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:01.564
CALPERS THEY DO AUDITS AND

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:03.166
THEY'VE DONE AUDITS OF PLASTER

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:05.034
COUNTY AND LONGEVITY HAS NEVER?

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:08.104
BEEN CALLED OUT THE PROCESS IS

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.672
FOR WHEN SOMEONE RETIRES.

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:12.408
THEY RECEIVE A REPORT FROM THE

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:14.510
LOCAL ENTITY AS TO WHAT IS THE

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:16.045
COMPENSATION AND IT'S BROKEN

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:18.281
DOWN AND DURING THAT TIME

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:20.383
CALPERS COMES UP WITH.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.784
IN FACT I THINK THAT'S WHAT

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:23.519
HAPPENED IN THE CITY OF DAVIS.

01:00:23.586 --> 01:00:24.988
THE THE QUESTION WILL HOLD IT

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:26.155
WHY ARE YOU GETTING THIS

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:28.358
LONGEVITY LET'S LOOK AT THE

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:29.759
LONGEVITY.

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:33.262
AND AND IT IT IN THEIR MIND IT

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.598
DID NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.500
THEIR DEFINITION OF LONGEVITY.

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:39.268
HERE.

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:42.505
WE HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR LONGEVITY.

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:43.606
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED CALPERS

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:45.274
HASN'T CHANGED YOUR DEFINITION

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:47.343
OF LONGEVITY NOTHING IS CHANGED

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.245
IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:50.380
WE'VE BEEN AUDIT.

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:51.881
YOU'VE REVIEWED THIS EVERY

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:55.218
SINGLE TIME SOMEONE HAS RETIRED.

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:56.185
THE HIGHER EARNERS WHEN THE

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:58.087
HIGHER EARNERS RETIRED THE THEY

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.722
DO MULTI MONTH.

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:02.225
INVESTIGATIONS THERE'S AN O. H.

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:03.760
DECISION THAT SPECIFICALLY

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:06.729
ADDRESSES THE PLASTER COUNTY --

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:09.532
LONGEVITY PROVISION AND IN THAT

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:13.636
CASE THEY DID NOT CONTEST THE

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:15.872
ARM THE LONGEVITY PROVISION BUT

01:01:15.938 --> 01:01:17.240
NOW THE NOW OUT THERE TO

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:20.443
CONTESTING IT OKAY SO REAL QUICK.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.611
JUST ONE REAL QUICK.

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:23.646
IT'S IT'S NOT BLACK AND WHITE IN

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:25.915
THE SENSE THAT YOU CAN PLACE ALL

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:29.285
OF THE BLAME ON THE EMPLOYER.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:32.588
AND NONE OF THE BLAME ON CALPERS.

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:34.123
IT'S IT'S JUST NOT LIKE THAT IN

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.759
REALITY IT TELLS ME LIKE.

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:37.560
WE'RE WE'RE I'M HEARING THE WORD

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:39.195
LONGEVITY THE TERM LONGEVITY A

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:40.663
LOT SEEM LIKE THE PROBLEM IS THE

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:41.631
INTERPRETATION.

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:43.166
OF LONGEVITY I DON'T SEE HOW

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:44.700
CALPERS CAN EVER CONSIDER IT NOT

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:45.935
TO BE PART OF NORMAL

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:47.470
COMPENSATION WHEN IT'S ON THE

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:48.438
SCHEDULE ITS BARGAINING CENTER

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:48.971
BUT THAT.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.239
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT WHITE BUT I

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.307
THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE BUT

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:52.775
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:53.409
NECESSARILY HERE TO TALK ABOUT

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:54.911
TODAY BUT AGAIN YOUR INTENT IS

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:55.978

AGENCIES INCLUDING CHARTER

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:58.381
SCHOOLS CORRECT.

01:01:58.448 --> 01:01:59.782
YES ECHO IT WILL IT WILL APPLY

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:01.250
TO CHARTERS CUTS OUT SALUTE IF

01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:02.585
THAT'S NOT CLEAR WE WILL MAKE

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:03.553
THAT CLEAR OKAY THANK MY INTENT

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:04.754

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:07.657
MAKE SURE BECAUSE YES.

01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:08.925
SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY IF THEY'RE

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:09.525
NOT IN.

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:10.960
THAT EVERYONE.

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:11.994
AROUND IS TRUE AND THEN WE HAVE

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:14.730
A COURT -- SO -- WITH THAT I

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.332
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:17.333
WHO WOULD HAVE REQUIRED COMMA

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:17.900
THERE'S A CASE PLAYING ON A

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:19.035
SECOND COUNTY THAT GOES BACK TO

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:20.403
THE EIGHTIES A BENEFIT THAT WAS

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:21.904
NEGOTIATED?

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:23.739
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS A NEW --

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:25.274
RETIREMENT BOARD DIRECTOR COME

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:27.376
IN CO AND SAID NO THEY SHOULD

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:28.478
RECEIVE THESE BENEFITS SO HER

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.179
SUDDEN IT GOES BACK. THIRTY

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:31.647
SOMETHING YEARS AND NOW THEY'RE

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.082
CHANGING IT AND WHO GETS TO THE

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:35.618
IN THE EMPLOYEE DOES RETIREES.

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:36.552
SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:38.621
WHERE BOTH SIDES GO IN.

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:40.056
NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS YEAH

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:41.757
CALPERS I BELIEVE THIS GROUP

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:42.859
ONCE IN AWHILE.

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:43.826
BUT WHEN YOU KNOW YOU GET

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:45.428
NEGOTIATED CONTRACT YOU KNOW

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:46.395
ABOUT IT.

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:48.264
YOU HAVE YOUR ATTORNEYS THERE

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.899
AND IF SOMEONE NEGOTIATED THAT

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.534
CONTRACT THAT'S ON THEM ON

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.970
EITHER SIDE I MEAN SO IT'S IT'S

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.071
KIND OF HARD IN.

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:56.606
NO IT'S NOT LAST NIGHT WE GOT

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:58.007
SOME MOM LEADS WITH CITIES MY

01:02:58.074 --> 01:03:07.550
LOCAL CITIES SENT ME LETTERS

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:08.184
OPPOSITION AT FIVE O'CLOCK LAST

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:08.918
NIGHT.

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:09.452
THAT'S B. S. IF YOU GOT A

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:10.486
PROBLEM.

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:12.688
HAVE THOSE FOLKS WAY IN EARLIER.

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:13.823
THE LEGAL AID INTO THE CITY'S

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:14.323
DIDN'T CELLS LIKE HEY.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:15.558
IS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU THAN

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.092
WAY IN EARLY THIS ISSUE.

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:16.859
AND A FIVE O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:17.460
AND IT'S DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:19.295
BUT THE BIG ISSUE IS LIKE I SAID

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:20.229
I'VE SEEN PUT OUT ON BOTH SIDES.

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:21.931
I SIMPLY PROJECT NEGOTIATED AND

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:22.698
GOT NO WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GO

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:25.768
INTO IT WITH WHAT EYES WIDE OPEN

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:27.203
SO.

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.638
THIS IS MY TWO CENTS WITHOUT

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:29.138
THAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:31.040
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:34.610
OFFER SOME ARTICLE IT'S I GUESS

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:36.245
I'M GONNA MOVE THE BILL BUT

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:38.347
THERE'S A DAY IN THIS AREA

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:40.716
GENERALLY AND I I'M I'M NOT

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:41.984
QUITE SURE HOW I WOULD.

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:44.554
FATHOM THE MEANING WE HAVE A

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.988
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION.

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:48.124
SOLIS WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:49.559
PENSIONS SYSTEM LIES WITH THE

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.494
RETIREMENT BOARD.

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:52.495
THIS INCLUDES A PAYMENT OF

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:55.364
BENEFITS IT'S ADMINISTRATION

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:55.665
[inaudible]

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:58.467
SO CONSTITUTIONALLY SOLIS WHO'S

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:00.503
RESPONSIBLE AS A PRUDENT EXPERT

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.104
BECAUSE THAT'S A STANDARD VOTERS

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:06.375
ADDED IN JUNE OF EIGHTY FOUR

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:07.743
UNITS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:09.712
SPECIFICALLY IN THE CONSTITUTION

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:11.948
NOT RETIREMENT BOARD'S.

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:13.683
SO I SEE IS KIND OF DOING SOME

01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:15.218
ADJUSTMENT BETWEEN.

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:16.852
THE RETIREMENT BOARD.

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:18.454
UNITS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SOME

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.723
ALLOCATION OF WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.124
BUT I SEE THE UNDERLYING

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:23.693
CONSCIOUS RAISES SAYS IT'S

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:25.428
RETIREMENT BOARD ITS SOLE AND

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:27.396
EXCLUSIVE INCLUDES

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:31.300
ADMINISTRATION -- SO I'M ALMOST

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:32.735
ONE IF THERE IS SOME.

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:33.970
WELL WHILE WE'RE TAKEN WITH THE

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:35.304
STATUTES WHETHER THIS.

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:37.073
UNDER GIRDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:40.643
LAW. TO FIND WHO'S RESPONSIBLE

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.612
IN THE TOP.

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:44.013
THE EXTERNAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.815
THERE IS A SPECIFIC DEFINITION

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:47.483
THE CUSTOMS TO SAYS RETIREMENT

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.285
BOARD DOES NOT INCLUDE LOCAL

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:50.720
ELECTED.

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:53.256
SO I HI JUST ADMITTING THAT I'M

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:54.357
ACTUALLY GOING TO SUPPORT THE

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:55.691
BILL HER TODAY.

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:58.561
BUT I EXACTLY HOW THIS WORKS IN

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:00.196
CONNECTION TO THE RELEVANT

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:01.631
CONSCIOUS PROVISION.

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:02.832
IS ACTUALLY SORT OF A QUESTION

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:05.801
MY MIND.

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:07.103
THANK YOU WITHOUT SAID ANOTHER

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.237
QUESTION BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:11.307
SENATOR LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:12.241
YOU VERY MUCH.

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:13.809
SHE THE DISCUSSION -- BUT I JUST

01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:15.478
WANT TO ALSO BE ON RECORD SAYING

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:16.812
THAT I COULD NOT DISAGREE MORE

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:18.514
WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES THEY

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:19.248
WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:20.950
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.518
OUT THERE IN THIS ACTUAL

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:23.619
SITUATION.

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:25.054
THERE ARE NOT THOUSANDS OF

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:26.455
PEOPLE OUT THERE THIS AFFECTS

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:28.691
VERY FEW PEOPLE OUR HOPE IS IT

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.159
WILL NOT AFFECT ANOTHER PERSON

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:32.161
THIS BILL WOULD JUST MAKE SURE

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:33.929
THAT WE HAVE A MECHANISM IN

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:35.965
PLACE SO THAT PERSON IS NOT

01:05:36.032 --> 01:05:37.099
HARMED.

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.534
THE SIXTEEN MILLION.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.169
I'D IF THAT IF THAT GENTLEMAN%

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:41.170
KNOWS THAT THEY THIS BILL COST

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:42.605
SOME SIXTEEN MILLION SINCE THEN

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:43.572
HE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE UNDER

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:45.441
PAYING PEOPLE AND THAT THEY HAVE

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:47.376

SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION THREE

URGES CONGRESS TO DO SOMETHING I

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:20.169
SHOULD HAVE DONE A LONG TIME AGO

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:21.337
WHICH IS REPEAL THE GOVERNMENT

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:22.972
PENSION OFFSET ALSO KNOWN AS THE

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:23.773
GPO.

01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:25.641
AND THE WIND POLLINATION

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.610
PROVISION WEB -- THESE ARE TO

01:07:27.676 --> 01:07:29.478
FEDERAL POLICIES THAT WHILE

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:30.546
PERHAPS WERE WELL INTENTIONED

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:32.214
APPROVING TOTALLY UNFAIR TO MANY

01:07:32.281 --> 01:07:34.183
PUBLIC SERVANTS THESE UPDATED

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.684
POLICIES ARE HAVING A DENTAL

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:37.520
EFFECT ON MANY HARD WORKING A

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:38.921
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SUCH TEACHERS.

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:40.556
FIREFIGHTERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.425
OFFICERS IF AN IMP IF AN

01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:44.059
EMPLOYEE HAS WORKED IN BOTH THE

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.262
PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTORS.

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:47.396
THEY MAY HAVE PAID INTO BOTH SO

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:49.999
SECURITY AND A SEPARATE

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:50.733
GOVERNMENT PENSION.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.668
IN THE CASE IF THIS IS THE CASE

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.503
THE WEAPONS SLASH AT PERSONS

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.338
RIGHTFULLY EARNED SO SECURITY BY

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:57.440
AT LEAST HALF.

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:58.507
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S A

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:01.177
FIREFIGHTER FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:03.446
AND HIS SOUL SECURITY.

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.714
SLASH BY 90%.

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:08.217
YEAH THE JEEP THE GPO IS SIMILAR

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:09.418
IF SOMEONE IS PAID IN FULL

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:10.653
SECURITY AND THEIR SPOUSE HAS

01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:12.087
PAID INTO SEPARATE GOVERNMENT

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:13.656
PENSION THEY KNOW SO SECURITY

01:08:13.722 --> 01:08:16.091
BENEFITS ARE IN DANGER AS WELL.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:18.160
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT FAIR

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:19.195
THERE'S NO REASON THE THESE

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.297
PEOPLE SHOULD GET BACK THEY

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:22.531
SHOULD GET BACK EVERYTHING THAT

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.833
THEY'VE PAID INTO.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.100
SO THIS IS SPECIALLY HARMFUL TO

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:26.569
LOW INCOME WORKERS WHO ARE

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:27.570
ALREADY A DISADVANTAGE.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:30.105
AND WHO RELY ON THESE BENEFITS

01:08:30.172 --> 01:08:31.607
AFTER THEY RETIRE.

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:32.274
AND MANY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:33.776
IT UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE THEY

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:34.610
RETIRE.

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:35.845
WHICH CAN CAUSE EXTREME

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:37.246
FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR THOSE WHO

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:38.781
DO KNOW BEFOREHAND THESE

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.049
POLICIES WILL DISCOURAGE HIM

01:08:40.115 --> 01:08:41.817
FROM PURSUING BADLY NEED PUBLIC

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:42.751
EMPLOYMENT.

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.286
LIKE TEACHING A PARTICULAR AIM

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:46.021
CONCERNED ABOUT STEM EDUCATION

01:08:46.088 --> 01:08:48.090
AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THIS

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:49.625
MAKES IT HARDER FOR OUR COUNTRY

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:50.759
TO COMPETE ON AN AT

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:52.261
INTERNATIONAL SCALE.

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:53.996
SO IT'S WELL PAST TIME THAT THE

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:55.130
CONGRESS DO THE RIGHT THING AND

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:57.800
REPEAL BOTH THE GPO AND WEPT.

01:08:57.867 --> 01:09:00.135

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.819
A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:17.887
TEACHING POPULATION IN THE STATE

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.289

STEM BUT THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.371
IS THAT WE HAVEN'T TOLD THEM

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:37.439
CAST WHAT BY SERVING THE KIDS IN

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.474
OUR STATE.

DECADES NOW UNFORTUNATELY

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:54.490
WITHOUT ANY RESOLUTION TO THIS

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:55.658

WHOSE SPOUSES JUST PASSED AND

01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:04.800
THEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.769
BENEFITS THAT THEY WERE RELYING

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:08.771

JUST HAVE IT RIPPED OUT FROM

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.957

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:29.892
UP FOR OUR POPULATION AND SINCE

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:31.260
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:32.161
OUR STATE.

01:10:32.227 --> 01:10:33.829

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.998
