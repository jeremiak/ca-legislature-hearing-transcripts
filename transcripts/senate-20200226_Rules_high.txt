TO SERVE IN THIS CAPACITY WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION YESTERDAY YOU MIGHT JUST BE OF INTEREST TO THE PANEL WE TALKED SOME ABOUT THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT SOME EFFORTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO. CHANGE THAT IN HE OFFERED SOME CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE SON INDENTURED SPECIES PROTECTION. IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND SHARING THAT WITH THIS. YEAH ABSOLUTELY- WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- TO HAVE OUR OWN CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT WHICH MEANS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ON PROTECTED SPECIES WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO OFFER VERY STRONG PROTECTIONS TO SPECIES HERE THAT FIND THEMSELVES ON THE TRAJECTORY TOWARDS EXTINCTION SO- WERE WERE VERY LUCKY TO BE IN THAT POSITION AND IN SOME IN SOME WAYS THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OFFERS EVEN MORE PROTECTION IT DOES HAVE A CLAUSE THAT SAYS- TAKE WILL BE. MINIMIZED AND FULLY MITIGATED FOR SPECIES THAT ARE LISTED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND FREQUENTLY ARE OUR PIECE OF LEGISLATION TENDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS POLITICIZED THAN THAT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER PROTECTIONS TO THE SPECIES THAT NEEDED HERE IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IT WILL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I DON'T HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR YOUR- COURTESY IN. FOR SENATOR RAWSON ME I THINK I'M GOOD FOR A WHILE SO THAT'S OKAY IN HERE THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SORRY WE DIDN'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET ALTHOUGH TALK TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND YOU GOT RAVE REVIEWS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. SO I THINK THE GOVERNOR MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE IN IN THIS IN THIS CASE. FISHING DANCE ONLY HAVE ONE I NEVER ASK A QUESTION THAT HAVE AS PRIVATELY BUT WE DID MEET PRIVATELY BUT YOU MENTIONED BASS FISHING SO WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. BASS FISHING I KNOW THE ANSWER I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU KNOW THE ANSWER. RATES SO THE BASS FISHING THAT WE DID WAS NOT IN CALIFORNIA SADLY BUT DO YOU KNOW WHERE. WE WERE AND WE WERE IN MEXICO OKAY YEAH WELL THE BEST IS IN MY DISTRICT IF YOU WANT TO BRING THE FAMILY COM. LET THE HOST YOU ITS CASTAIC LAKE RIGHT UP BY FIVE IN TODAY BELIEVE THAT THE LARGEST BASS IN THE WORLD IS IN. IN THAT LAKE THANK YOU SENATOR WHERE IT IS MORE LIKE A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IN IN SPONSORSHIP ADS IF YOU GET IT SO BRING- FAMILY DOWN MAYBE AUGMENT YOUR- YOU ONLY GET PER DIEM WAS NOT VERY MUCH MONEY SO MAYBE WE CAN AUGMENTED BY. HAVING YOUR DAUGHTER YOUR SON CASH THAT WORLD RECORD BASS THANK ANYWAY CONGRATULATIONS ON THE- NICE. THERE'S A LOT I COULD SAY. I SENATOR BATES I WILL JUST BE- TURN IT OVER TO YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START WITH I'VE GONE TO A CAMPUS IN WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD FISH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD THOUGH BECAUSE MY HUSBAND'S A FILTER PERSON BUT- ANYWAY I HAVE A WONDERFUL BACKGROUND WONDERFUL PRESENTATION I WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET. FACE TO FACE BUT CERTAINLY A YEAR CIVIL QUALIFIED AND YOU HAVE WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE ONLINE SERVICES THAT YOU HAVE A REAL PASSION FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION BECAUSE THIS IS A AN ISSUE THAT'S COME UP LEGISLATIVELY. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS ON THE PART OF A LEGISLATOR WHO IS NOW RETIRED BUT IT WAS THE EXTENSION OF FISHING LICENSES FOR A YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE AND I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A RECOMMENDATION OUGHT TO THE COMMISSION FROM THE DEPARTMENT. WHERE ARE YOU ON THAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT BECAUSE IT TO THE- PROM THAT WE'RE IN WITH REDUCTION IN. ACTUALLY THE LICENSE BECAUSE- MANY OF THEM DON'T LAST THE ENTIRE YEAR YOU HAVE TO RE UP SO IT SEEMED TO BE A- BETTER WAY TO DO IT BY. REGULAR THEY LEGISLATION BY. ON THAT WAS A- PLAN AT HIM FOR A COUPLE YEARS. WHAT PAST COUPLE YEARS. SO YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR BATES- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE FISH AND GAME CODE IS WRITTEN WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE THE AUTORITY. TO GET AWAY FROM THE CALENDAR YEAR- LICENSES BUT THERE IS A BILL- BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. THAT DOES PROPOSE THIS- TWELVE MONTHS AT LICENSE- LICENSE OVER A- ANNUAL CALENDAR YEAR. AND WE HAVEN'T TAKEN A FORMAL POSITION ON ITS I AM AWARE THAT OTHER STATES HAVE TRIED THE STRATEGY AND FOR EXAMPLE IN ABOUT I BELIEVE SALES WENT UP. 35% OR SO- IT COULD BE A FIT FOR CALIFORNIA BUT AGAIN WE HAVEN'T TAKEN A POSITION ON IT I KNOW THAT. THERE ARE SOME UP FRONT COSTS POTENTIALLY RELATED TO- INSTALLING NEW SOFTWARE SO YOU CAN GET THE SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUTO RENEWAL PIECE IS A IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT AS WELL FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE TWELVE MONTH CYCLE FOR FISHING LICENSES BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WERE AWARE OF BEEN. AND THINKING AND TRACKING CLOSELY. LEGISLATOR THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR AND YOU WILL HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT GRADUATIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR. THANK YOU- I'M THRILLED TO SEE THE GOVERNOR APPOINT ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS AND- I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH SENATOR OFTEN. RESERVE OR- MAIN ONLY WORK WITH PRESS. I THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GRAY.

MY PARENTS SACRIFICED EVERYTHING SO THAT MY BROTHERS AND I COULD HAVE A BETTER LIFE AND A CHANCE AT A FUTURE THIS IS WHY A THEY WERE RELENTLESS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE TOOK EVERY ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THE TO US BY THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY I SHARE THIS WITH YOU BECAUSE MY CHARACTER IS SHAPED BY MY EXPERIENCES AND MY COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SERVICE IS ROOTED IN THE IDEA THAT GOVERNMENT CAN AND MUST LOOK TO BUILD AN EQUITABLE JUST AND TOLERANT SOCIETY. TOGETHER WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS WE CAN BUILD A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL OUR JOB AS GOVERNMENT IS NOT ONLY O LEFT THOSE WHO'VE BEEN MARGINALIZED BUT TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE ABLE TO LIVE HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES.

TO ARE YOUR FAMILY. LET ME START WITH YOU SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN MISTER MEETS THANK YOU FOR. YOUR SERVICE TODAY AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS APPOINTMENT ALSO WANT TO WELCOME YOUR FAMILY FOR NOT ONLY BEING HERE BUT FOR THEIR SUPPORT. OF YEAR. AMAZING SUCCESS IN IN RESUME I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY I APPRECIATED THE- BROAD RANGE AND SHARING SOME OF THE- CHALLENGES THAT. YOUR FAMILY SUCCESSFULLY INJURED IN IN OVER CAME- WE TALKED SOME ABOUT THE CORONA VIRUS- IT'S IN OUR HEADLINES IN OUR MINDS I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN IN A KEY POSITION OF TRYING TO COORDINATE RESPONSE IN CALIFORNIA. MAYBE REAL TIME SHARE WITH THIS KIND OF PUT SOME OF THE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN HOW YOU'RE WORKING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES- AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND I THINK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET WITH ME YESTERDAY I KNOW THAT THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS IS SOMETHING THAT'S TOP OF EVERYBODY'S MIND SO. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME THINKING AND WORKING ON SO ET ME WALK YOU THROUGH WHAT WE'VE DONE TODAY AND WHAT WE KNOW AS OF THIS MORNING. FIRST THE SPREAD WITHIN CALIFORNIA WE CURRENTLY HAVE EIGHT INDIVIDUALS HAVE TESTED POSITIVE OF ALL RETURN FROM THIS. FROM CHINA- WE HAVE BEEN PRO ACTIVELY WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL COUNTERPARTS. BOTH AT THE COUNTY AND CITY LEVEL AS WELL AS OUR EALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. TO PREPARE THEM FOR THIS EVENT. UNLIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM IS UNBELIEVABLY IMPRESSIVE. AND I AM. CONFIDENT THAT SHOULD THIS VIRUS SPREAD ANY FURTHER BEYOND- WHAT IT HAS TO DATE. THAT WE ARE UNBELIEVABLY. TO RESPONSE I'LL SAY WITH THAT. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS FROM A ONE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE SO. YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES LEADING THIS EFFORT. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES A STORY. THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARE CALLOW YES PARTNERS. AND THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ARE THERE- AND THAT OUR- OUR- HEALTHCARE DELIVERY PARTNERS ARE THERE. RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN CONVENING WITH. OUR SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES WE SEND OUT FACT SHEETS TO SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE'VE DONE THE SAME FOR PRESCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE FACILITIES. AS WELL AS UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES- WE'VE BEEN IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I LEAD A CALL EVERY MORNING WITH MY COLLEAGUES WITH THE CDC THE ASPER AND THE HHS. AND WE ARE IN COORDINATION WITH ALL OF THE OTHER ENTITIES OF STATE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE RESPONDING THIS REALISTICALLY- I THINK THIS IS INVOLVING SITUATION- THAT IS CHANGING QUITE RAPIDLY. BUT I THINK IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE DEFINITELY PREPARED WE'VE BEEN TESTED WITH H. ONE AND ONE AND SARS- BUT I THINK WE ARE READY TO TAKE THIS ON. THANK YOU. IRIS OTHER MEMBERS MAY HAVE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ON THAT BUT I WANT TO JUST TEST ANOTHER QUESTION WE DISCUSSED. POTENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS OF THE PUBLIC CHARGE ANA DECLARATIONS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- FOCUSED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS BUT- OUR CONCERN ABOUT. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN US CITIZENS NOT FULLY REALIZING BENEFITS THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR HOW HOW ARE YOU AND YOUR DEPARTMENT DEALING WITH THAT SENATOR THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AGAIN AND THIS IS TOP OF MY MIND WITH THAT- WITH THE FINALIZATION OF THE FEDERAL RULE ON MONDAY. THERE'S TWO PIECES TO THIS FIRST I THINK THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE UNBELIEVABLY VULNERABLE- AND THEY ARE SCARED IN TERMS OF WHAT BENEFITS THEY MIGHT WANT TO PARTAKE IN A AND WHAT IMPACT THAT MIGHT HAVE ON THEIR STATUS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. WHAT WE'VE DONE IS REALLY LOOKED AT HOW WE ORGANIZE COLLECTIVELY IS ONE GOVERNMENT TO THINK ABOUT OUR MESSAGING SO IT'S NOT BIFURCATED AND DIFFERENT WHEN IT COMES OUT OF SACRAMENTO- AND MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK THE COMMUNITY THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO HEAR FROM STATE GOVERNMENT THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM THE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY TRUST AND VALUE. AND SO WE'VE BUILT COALITIONS WITHIN IT WITH ORGANIZATIONS ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO EMPOWER THEM WITH THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION SO THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS THE CHALLENGE SENATOR HERE IS NOT OVER COMMITTING IN TELLING SOMEBODY THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY BUT REASSURING THEM THAT HERE IS THE INFORMATION THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE AND BEING ABLE TO NAVIGATE AND THROUGH THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. EARLIER THIS WEEK WE SENT OUT TO ALL YOUR OFFICES FACT SHEETS IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH ABOUT THIS TOPIC WE ALSO WORKED WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES TO SEND OUT INFORMATION TO WORK ACT IT COUNTERPARTS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE ADMINISTERED. BY OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY ALSO HAVE THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION AND SO OUR HOPE IS BY ENGAGING LOCAL COUNTERPARTS IN ORDER TO SPREAD THE INFORMATION AND GIVE THE INFORMATION TO THEM IN A WAY THAT'S DIGESTIBLE UNDERSTANDABLE AS A WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA I. BUT A IS SOMETHING THAT'S OF SICK. CONCERN TO ME AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO. THANK YOU AND AS YOU MENTION AS WE DISCUSSED YESTERDAY THE CHALLENGE. IS PROVIDING ACCURATE INFORMATION SO WE DON'T. CAN MISLEAD PEOPLE IN A MANNER THAT CAN HAVE AN ADVERSE CONSEQUENCE BUT YOU HAVE FAMILIES WITH CITIZEN CHILDREN. MAYBE A GREEN CARD LEGAL IMMIGRANT PARENT MAY BE A PARENT AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO ADJUST STATUS- IN AS A FAMILY THEY'RE HAVING TO NAVIGATE- A LABYRINTH OF DIFFERENT. REGULATIONS BUT NUTRITION PROGRAMS THAT US CITIZEN CHILDREN ARE FULLY ELIGIBLE FOR IN MANY IMMIGRANT CHILDREN ARE. MAYBE JUST A FINAL COMMENT ON HOW IN YOUR WORK WHEN THE COUNTIES AND AGENCIES. WE DON'T OVER PROMISE BUT WE ALSO WORK TO MAKE SURE THOSE THAT ARE INDEED LEGAL LEGALLY ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES- DON'T MISS OUT ON WHAT CAN HELP THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF OUR BROADER COMMUNITIES YEAH I THINK WE HAVE TO WALK A VERY FINE BALANCE- WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT'S ACCURATE BUT NOT OVER. OVER REASSURING AND SO I THINK PART OF IT IS BEING ABLE TO BE NIMBLE AND ADJUSTING OUR MESSAGING AS WE BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONCERNS OF THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND ARE AND I THINK ALSO LOOKING AT OUR DATA IN CASE SO IT'S AND THE TRENDS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITHIN THE DATA- I THINK THAT WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO BE. TRUE PARTNERS IN THIS EFFORT AND IN REAL TIME ADJUSTER MESSAGING SHOULD WE NEED TO ADJUSTED- I THINK WE HAVE TO BALANCE THIS NOTION OF OVER PROMISING TO INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS S. TELLING SOMEBODY THAT THEY ARE OKAY TO RECEIVE BENEFITS THEM RECEIVING BENEFITS AND THEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT DEEMING THEM ELIGIBLE FOR CITIZENSHI AND WE HAVE WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN TERMS OF HOW WE DRAW THE LINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH I'M GONNA THANK YOU. THAT APPROACH ACTUALLY- I HAVE NO WELL I HAVE NO QUESTIONS RESPECTFULLY CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE. AT SOME POINT. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH YOU AS TO WHETHER. WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE THE CHANGES TO THE MCO TAX IN THE PROPOSED- PROGRAM CHANGES- HAVING TO DO WITH BLOCK GRANTS AND ARE MEDI CAL PROGRAM BUT I'LL SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER TIME AND WOULD GET HERE. WE'LL BE HAPPY TO MOVE YOUR CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME SENATOR THANK YOU VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THOROUGHLY ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY BY THE WAY I THINK YOU HAVE GREAT TASTE AND TIES. I THINK SOME AGO I THINK IT WILL BRING YOU WITH ME- AND I REALLY ENJOYED YOU EDUCATED ME ON THE WHOLE CORONA VIRUS THING BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT. WHERE THIS NEWSPAPERS RADIO TV THEY'RE THERE TO SELL ADVERTISING SPACE I KNOW THEY'RE SCARING US AND AS YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A FRIEND RIGHT NOW WHO'S IN A FEDERAL FACILITY IN OMAHA BECAUSE HE WAS HIM AS MY FROM THE DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE AND- HOW DID THIS. TEN DAY CRUISE FOURTEEN DAYS SITTING. IN YOUR ROOM A ON A CRUISE SHIP. AND THEN YOU THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE GOING TO GO HOME IN THE SAID NOPE YOU YOU TEST FOR CORONAVIRUS NOW HE'S IN OMAHA AND THEY KEEP SAYING HE'S GONNA GO HOME AND ANY HE'S BEEN THERE FOR EVER- SO THAT WAS GOOD. MY DAD I DON'T NEED TO GO TO STATUS I KNOW YOU KNOW THEM THAT I WANT TALK ABOUT FOSTER USE. OF IN MY DISTRICT ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE FOSTER YOUTH RESIDE IN MY DISTRICT. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATS IS IN ABJECT FAILURE AT AS A PROGRAM AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT SO I'M GONNA MAKE A KIND OF BROAD BASE AND YOU TAKE IT ANYWAY YOU WANT TO GO. I'M INTERESTED IN THAT THE COORDINATION OF SERVICES A PARTICULARLY AS IT PERTAINS TO MENTAL HEALTH. AND THEN WHAT SPECIFIC STEPS IS AGENCY LOOK AT DOING IN TERMS EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR YOU TO TAKING THE TIME YESTERDAY TO MEET WITH ME. I WILL SAY THAT I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE YOUTH AND CHILDREN ARE IN OUR CUSTODY IN THERE ARE KIDS. AND I THINK THAT CULTURE IN THAT MENTALITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THIS PERSON'S CATER THAT DEPARTMENTS KID THERE ARE COLLECTIVE AND WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM. I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM EFFORT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I THINK IT'S PART OF A CULTURE CHANGE BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE COUNTY LEVEL TO THINK DIFFERENTLY. ABOUT HOW WE TAKE CARE OF THESE KIDS. AND PRIMARILY WE'VE BEEN PUTTING THESE CHILDREN IN CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS THAT DO NOT YOUR THE OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT IN FACT THEY ARE. THAT THEY'RE NOT THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE PUTTING THEM AND SO PART OF CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM WAS TO SAY. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE PLACE THESE CHILDREN. IN FAMILY SETTINGS WHERE THEY CAN THRIVE AND BE SUCCESSFUL. AND SO I AM REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THE TRANSITION THAT WE'VE MADE WITH REGARDS TO C. C. R. I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THAT FRONT. I THINK IN ORDER FOR US TO ENSURE THAT THESE KIDS HAVE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES BOTH WHETHER IT'S THE- MATTER. A SIDE. I WE OUGHT NEED ENSURE THE STRIP. OR THE END. WHO TAKING. THEM HAVE APPROPRIATE TO ASSISTANCE. SUPPORT THEM. WELL IT IN THE ALL OF THEM HAS A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CAL. AND THE PARENT KNOWS TO TURN TO OUR HOW TO DEAL WITH IT. THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT WE TO BE WORKING ON IT ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THESE ARE SUCCESSFUL. I AM PRETTY COMP THAT OR CALL. HAS NEEDLE. DO I. THAT WE- DON'T. OUT I THINK GOT LOTS MORE WORK DO AND POP OF IT IS S. S. COMING TO. AND BREAKING TO. THIS I THINK THAT. SOME OF THE HIGH NEEDS IT SO AB TWO. EIGHT THE- PAST. LAST I'D- REALLY. IT ON IF. ABOUT HOW. BRING TO. A SYSTEM OF CARE FOR THESE CHILDREN NOT MULTIPLE SYSTEMS BUT ONE SYSTEM WHETHER THEY'RE GETTING SERVICES FROM MEDICAID OR THE REGIONAL CENTER SPORTS. ED THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS IS THE KID. AND HERE THE KIDS NEEDS AND WE'RE WRAPPING OURSELVES AROUND THOSE NEEDS- AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND OTHER COLLEAGUES. I THINK WE ARE ARE NOW MEASURING OUR SUCCESS WITH REGARDS TO SEIZE HERE THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT I'M REALLY PROUD OF WHERE WE'VE COME TODAY. EIGHTY MORE WE CAN DO ON ON THE EDUCATIONAL SIDE OF IT. YEAH I MEAN I THINK PART OF IT IS OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS PART OF THIS TWENTY EIGHTY THREE WORK WE BROUGHT THEM INTO OUR- INTO OUR- A FULL THEN. ARE REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE- ALIGN BOTH THE HEALTH SIDE IN THE EDUCATION SIDE BECAUSE- IF YOU SEND A KID TO SCHOOL AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE NUTRITION OR THE- ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. YOU KNOW THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES ARE NOT GONNA BE THERE SIMILARLY. TO HEALTH OUTCOMES I MEAN WE CAN GIVE SOMEBODY HEALTH INSURANCE BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE FOOD ON THE TABLE IF THEY DON'T HAVE HOUSING IF THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION. WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE SAME OUTCOMES AND SO I THINK PART OF IT IS MAKING SURE THAT WERE SPEAKING AS ONE SYSTEM. AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN MAKE SOME COULD PRETTY STRONG PROGRESS IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS. GREAT THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT LOOKING FOR TO VOTING FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION TODAY THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES.

INTERVIEWS THAT I'VE HAD IN PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF IN MY DAILY WORK HAVING BEEN A SOCIAL WORKER AND- UNDER- CERTAINLY THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND- HUMAN SERVICES MANY YEARS AGO. THERE WASN'T A QUESTION THAT I COULD ASK MR MEETS THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE A VERY IN DEPTH ANSWER TO AND THAT IS IMPRESSIVE. HOW WE HAVE THE CORONA VIRUS ISSUE- YET ORANGE COUNTY ALL RIGHT IT IS UNDER LITIGATION SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO THERE BUT- HE ANSWERED EVERY. SINGLE QUESTION ABOUT THAT. HE ALSO DISPELLED ANY- RUMORS THAT WE ARE NOT COORDINATING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BOB THAT IS VERY VERY CLOSELY COORDINATED AND NOW HE IS. HAVING WEEKLY BRIEFINGS WITH THOSE OF US WHO HAPPEN TO HAVE. ALL THOSE SITUATIONS IN OUR DISTRICTS SO- NOT A SINGLE QUESTION I TALKED ABOUT THIS FUNDING. ALL THAT COUNTY BELIEVE FOR WHERE THAT'S GOING ANY IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME HOW THEY'LL BE APPROACHING THAT. SO I'VE ANSWERED ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT I GAVE YOU THAT YOU GAVE ME THE ANSWERS TO.

DON'T HOLD THAT AGAINST ME WHEN I CALL THE ALL. TIME AND SAY I NEED SOMETHING BECAUSE- I'M BLAMING THEM FOR THAT. I TOLD THEM DON'T ASK ME FIRST OFF BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU NEED- SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU KNOW. BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT I DID WANT TO ASK- SORT OF ALONG THE LINES- YOU KNOW WE HAD AN OUTBREAK OF HEPATITIS A IN SAN DIEGO. A FEW YEARS AGO AND BASED ON A STATE AUDIT AND- LEGISLATURE REFORMS AND RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE WE SEEN AN IMPACT ON THAT AND I'LL MAKE THE QUESTION A LITTLE BIT BROADER BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT THE CURRENT. SITUATION WITH CORNER VIRUS. IT WE WORK THROUGH OUR PARTNERS THE COUNTIES I JUST WOULD LOVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF EACH TIME SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS HOWEVER WE WORK IN BETTER AND BETTER WITH THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE PARTNERS WE ARE A BIG STATE. AND IT SEEMS A LITTLE FRIGHTENING TO ME THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO COUNT ON FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE. WORKING WITH THE STATE DO YOU SEE AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR SENATOR IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION AROUND THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION ON THE HEPATITIS OUTBREAK I THINK I'M THAT DID NOT GO OUT WELL AND I THINK WE LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS WITH REGARDS TO OUR ROLE AS A STATE AND OUR COUNTY PARTNERSHIP AND I THINK THAT. WHAT I WILL SAY THERE IS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE PROACTIVE IN THERE OKAY INSTANCES WHERE WE MIGHT DISAGREE WITH THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY IN TERMS OF APPROACH AND THAT'S OKAY. I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE AN HONEST AND FRANK CONVERSATION AND WE NEED TO BE OPEN ABOUT IT AND- I THINK THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM THESE INSTANCE SAYS. EVERY SINGLE SCENARIO IS DIFFERENT AND EVERY RESPONSE YIELDS A DIFFERENT RESPONSE AND I THINK PART OF IT IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING WHAT OUR ROLES AND AUTHORITIES ARE AND IN SOME INSTANCES A REQUIRE US GOING IN AND SAYING WE MIGHT HAVE A DISAGREEMENT AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE- ELEVATE THAT IN THE STATE TAKING A MORE PROMINENT ROLE IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY- I. THINK THAT WE LEARNED A LOT FROM THAT AUDIT FINDING IN TERMS OF SAN DIEGO IN PARTICULAR. AND I THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING A LOT IN ORDER TO THINKING ABOUT HOW TO BE MORE REALISTICALLY RESPONSE SOME OF THESE PIECES IT'S NOT ALTHOUGH EVERY CAN IN A BE FOR. BRUCE TO BE SPENT THERE ARE PLUS THAT WE HAVE OUR JOB. TO I'M SO. I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT WE LEARNED FROM THAT EXPERIENCE IN SAN DIEGO. IN IT I MEAN I THINK FOR ME AND PROBABLY FOR MY COLLEAGUES ALL OVER THE STATE WHEN THERE IS A SITUATION LIKE THAT. AND WE MAY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW ARE COUNTY MIGHT BE ACTING WE'RE NOT I'M NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT BY ANY STRETCH. YOU KNOW. I THINK I WANT TO KNOW WHEN CAN THE STATE STEP IN AND TAKE A OVER RIDE- AND AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU. FEEL LIKE YOU GET THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE A SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. MAKE A DETERMINATION AND DECIDE. WHETHER IT IS IN THE OVER ARCHING- INTEREST FOR STATE PUBLIC HEALTH. FOR THE STATE TO ACTUALLY. STEP IN AND DO WE HAVE REALLY THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. I THINK WE DO AND I THINK THAT IT WILL ALWAYS DEPEND ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN BUILD CONSENSUS WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS THAT'S THE- THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO STRIVE FOR. FIRST AND FOREMOST BUT I THINK IF THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN AND AT LEAST IN THE PUBLIC CAL SPACE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL PARTICULARLY. THEIR THINGS ACTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE AT THE STATE LEVEL IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT. WE ARE AT LEAST PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE OF INDIVIDUALS IN EITHER THAT COMMUNITY OR IN THE BROADER COMMUNITY CONTEXT. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. THAT GIVES ME A SENSE OF WELL BEING THAT. YOU WANT TO WORK WITH THE PARTNERS BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE PREPARED TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BOB AND YOU DONE THAT AGAIN GET. ON MULTIPLE ISSUES TERMS NEED IN THE COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY. I WILL SAY IN. WE NEEDED STATE ASSISTANCE- ON AN ISSUE THAT WAS A REALLY HOURS. TECHNICALLY SPEAKING ARE LEGALLY SPEAKING BUT WE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR VISITING THE SHELTER I THINK IT MEANT. A GREAT DEAL TO A LOT OF PEOPLE- SO MY THANKS TO YOU FOR DOING THAT THANK YOU IT'S OUR COMMUNITY- I WE DON'T. MAY I WELL IT WITH THE A SIDE WE DON'T ALL SIT ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THE HOMELESS. PROPOSE ONE PLANNED- ANYTHING AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME CONVERSATION ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. I'D LOVE TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR VISION ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND HOW YOU'RE- UNDERTAKING- THE CONVERSATION AS WE COME TOGETHER TO TRY TO. SUPPORT THE RESOURCES BUT MAKE SURE. THAT I THEY WILL BE USED EFFECTIVELY WORKING WITH THOSE SAME PARTNERS IN MANY CASES AND OTHERS. SO I THINK SENATOR IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I'M GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR AT LEAST THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. I THINK IT IS STILL A CRISIS AND I THINK IT JUST POINTS TO. THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT ON THIS BY DEDICATING HIS ENTIRE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS TO THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC- IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU- WE'RE LOOKING TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO HOUSING SERVICES FUND WITH THE IDEA THAT WE INVEST SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND BUILD ON TOP OF THAT WITH PHILANTHROPIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR DOLLARS- I THINK. WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS A LOOK AT HOW WE DISRUPT THIS ISSUE. AND PERHAPS A DIFFERENT WAY THAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND IN MY CONVERSATION CENTER BATES IN PARTICULAR I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO THE CATERPILLAR DE THAT. THE OUTCOMES WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO PARTICULAR OUTCOMES THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE WITH THESE DOLLARS TEN PART OF IT TOO IS THAT- PUBLISHED IT DOES NOT. ISOLATED TO ONE PARTICULAR. AREA OF WHETHER THAT'S A GEOGRAPHIC CITY OR CAN BE. FACT MOVES ACROSS CAP LINES ANY. SAYS SO. THERE NOT ALL THE TRYING PRESENT TO. IS LOOK AT HOW DO WE JUST THIS PROCESS. IN ORDER PRIVATE OUT MEANS THE ONLY OTHER THING I WAS IS THAT GOV CANNOT SOLVE THE ALONE. IN PART OF THE IDEA BE. REALLY LOOK AT CREE THIS FIND. AND ALLOWING PHILANTHROPY AND PRIVATE SECTOR TO COME TO THE TABLE IS TO REALLY CREATIVELY THINK ABOUT HOW WE YES CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER. TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEMFOR THE NEIGHBORS THAT WE WALK BY I MEAN THIS AFTERNOON ON MY WAY INTO THE CAPITAL. I DID WALK BY A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SITTING ON THE STREET. AND I THINK WE MUST DO BETTER FOR THEM WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE NOT IN SHOULD ONLY ENSURE. THAT WE GIVE THEM HOUSING BUT THAT WE WRAP THEM AROUND WITH THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES SAID THAT WE ADDRESS THEIR MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE SO THAT THEY CAN STAY HOUSE. IT DOESN'T DO THEM ANY GOOD TO JUST GIVE THEM A PLACE TO GO WITHOUT REALLY ADDRESSING THEIR UNDERLYING NEEDS SIMILARLY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS FOR ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS. THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE WRAP OURSELVES AROUND THEM TO THINK ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY KEEP THEM HOUSE AND SO. MY HOPE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AS WE DELIBERATE AS YOU DELIBERATE THE BUDGET AND WE ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION WITH YOU. AT OUR LOCAL PARTNERS IS A REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS BALLISTICALLY AND LOOK THIS. STAFF MOVING FOR. BUT THANK YOU I. HI A. I THINK ALL THE TIME ADD BEEN DOING WORK FOR WELL OVER TWO DE AND I THINK IT REALLY I FIND IS SOMEWHAT OF A AN ISSUE OF. AND WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO STAY FOCUSED. FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE- YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE WATCHED ONE WOMAN IN THIS PARK THE ENTIRE TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE FIRST YEAR I TRIED TO OFFER HER FOOD. I AND SHE WON'T I CAN YOU CAN APPROACH- AND I'D LIVE ACROSS FROM THE PARK AND I SEE HER AND I. SEE THE WOMAN THAT SPEAKS RUSSIAN- AND TALKS TO HERSELF ALL NIGHT I MEAN HIGH LOOK AT THE FACES. AND I REALIZE I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR TEN YEARS AND I HAVE GOTTEN MONEY FOR HOUSING. AND I'VE WORKED ON HOMELESSNESS AND WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE. AND I A I THINK IT IS A FAILURE- THAT ALL OF US SHARE. AND SO I AM WERE READY TO TRY ANY NEW APPROACH- AS LONG AS WE'RE GOING TO STICK TO IT STAY FOCUSED AND MAKE SURE THOSE RESOURCES ARE GOING WHERE THEY NEED TO GO ONE MORE HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE OUTCOMES. SO I WISH YOU THE BEST AND IF YOU ARE THE TOP PERSON I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU FURTHER. MORE EVIL WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU- SO THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE I HAVE WAITED. YEARS FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS OF THIS. AND SO.
