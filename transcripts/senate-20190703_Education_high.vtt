AYE OPPOSED POSITION AT THIS

00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:56.414
TIME WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:57.282
CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHORS

OFFICE WHEN IT THANK HEIR STAFF

00:26:58.116 --> 00:26:59.617
FOR THAT TIME BUT WE DO HAVE.

00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:01.820
A FEW CONCERNS I JUST WANT TO

00:27:01.886 --> 00:27:03.688
HIGHLIGHT ON THIS BILL -- I

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:05.023
THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.324
QUESTION FOR US IS IS IS THE

00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:07.859
GOAL OF THIS THIS POLICY

00:27:07.926 --> 00:27:10.128
CONSISTENCY -- ACCURACY AND WE

00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:10.695
DO BELIEVE THAT THIS WOUD

00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:12.664
CREATE A CONSISTENT MECHANISM

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:14.332
FOR HOUSEHOLDS HAVE TO CALCULATE

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:16.201
HOUSING BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE.

00:27:16.267 --> 00:27:17.235
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE MORE

00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:18.803
ACCURATE -- YOU KNOW OUR SCHOOLS

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.105
DO WORK HARD TO SET THIS

00:27:20.171 --> 00:27:22.374
ACCURATELY WERE REQUIRED UNDER

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.876
FEDERAL RAGS TO TO SET IT IS

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:25.810
ACTUALLY POSSIBLE FOR THE ACTUAL

00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:27.479
LIVING CONDITION OF WHERE

00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:29.848
STUDENTS GO TO SCHOOL -- AND YOU

00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:31.182
KNOW I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE TWO

00:27:31.249 --> 00:27:31.883
EXAMPLES I THINK HIGHLIGHT ARE

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.618
CONCERNED WITH PERHAPS THE THE

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:37.055
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS.

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:39.024
SO.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.492
UNDER THIS BILL -- ALL OUR

00:27:40.558 --> 00:27:41.593
INSTITUTIONS IN LA COUNTY WE

00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:42.260
HAVE TWENTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS IN

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:43.261
LA COUNTY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:45.430
USE THE SAME HIGH DATA POINT AND

00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:46.531
SETTING.

00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:48.933
HOUSING A CALC ACOSTA TENANTS

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.101
JUST BE CLEAR THIS IS SETTING

00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:51.569
BECAUSE WE TEND TO THE CEILING.

00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:52.570
THE OUR SCHOOLS CAN PROVIDE

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:54.773
EIGHT UP TO THAT POINT WE CAN'T

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.641
PROVIDED BEYOND THAT.

00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:58.543
SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT FOR ALL

00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:59.110
OUR SCHOOLS LA COUNTY -- WE

00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:00.412
WOULD HAVE TO USE A FIGURE ONE

00:28:00.478 --> 00:28:01.012
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY

00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:01.679
FOUR DOLLARS THAT WOULD APPLY TO

00:28:01.746 --> 00:28:02.714
OUR SCHOOLS IN MALIBU IN WITH

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:04.349
HERE IN PASADENA AND EVERYWHERE

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:06.451
ELSE IN BETWEEN THE COUNTY -- IN

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:07.085
OUR SCHOOLS ARE CONCERNED THEY

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:08.586
ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT THE LOCAL

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:09.888
HOUSING CONTACTS IN THE REGION

00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:11.689
THERE AND THAT THAT NUMBER MIGHT

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:14.225
NOT BE THE MOST ACCURATE MEASURE.

00:28:14.292 --> 00:28:15.126
IN A COUNTY'S LARGEST LA.

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:17.295
ANOTHER EXAMPLE -- IN RIVERSIDE

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:19.831
COUNTY THAT FIGURE WOULD BE NINE

00:28:19.898 --> 00:28:20.899
HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX DOLLARS FOR A

00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:24.469
ONE BEDROOM -- HOUSING AT LAST

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:25.370
YEAR WHICH IS ONE REMEMBER

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:26.004
INSTITUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY USING

00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:28.740
A NUMBER OF ONE THOUSAND ONE

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:29.507
HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DOLLARS -- SO

00:28:29.574 --> 00:28:30.675
IN ESSENCE WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS

00:28:30.742 --> 00:28:31.810
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF AID BY

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:33.478
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN

00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:34.679
DOLLARS PER MONTH AT OUR SCHOOLS

00:28:34.746 --> 00:28:35.914
COULD PROVIDE.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.450
STUDENTS -- IN THAT AREA -- NET

00:28:38.516 --> 00:28:40.718
EFFECT BEING ABOUT FOURTEEN

00:28:40.785 --> 00:28:42.387
HUNDRED DOLLARS LESS AN AIDE PER

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:43.888
YEAR AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE YOU

00:28:43.955 --> 00:28:45.457
KNOW WE'RE DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM

00:28:45.523 --> 00:28:45.957
SO WE'RE USING A NUMBER

00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:47.859
MECHANISM SOME SCHOOLS LOOK AT

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:49.994
SEARS AND JUST UPDATE HAVE BEEN

00:28:50.061 --> 00:28:50.728
UPDATING FOR INFLATION.

00:28:50.795 --> 00:28:52.163
SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE ARE

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.199
ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE NEW SEARS

00:28:54.265 --> 00:28:55.733
DATA WHICH IS GOING TO BE MORE

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.234
NUANCED AND LOCALIZED.

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:58.236
OTHERS LOOK AT LOCAL HOUSING

00:28:58.303 --> 00:29:00.171
SURVEYS I EVEN OTHER SURVEYS

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.806
WITH AND HIDE IT FOR EXAMPLE IN

00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:02.874
RIVERSIDE COUNTY TALK ABOUT

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.209
SIGNIFICANT VARIATION WITHIN

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:05.410
REGIONS -- YOU KNOW WHETHER

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:07.512
YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT TO A CAMPUS OR

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:08.113
WHETHER YOU'RE IN A MORE RURAL

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:10.048
AREA SO THOSE ARE OUR CONCERNS

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:12.083
WE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WORK HARD

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:12.984
TO SET THIS IS ACCURATELY AS

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:14.519
POSSIBLE CAUSES IMPLICATIONS FOR

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.955
STUDENTS -- BUT THAT WE WE

00:29:17.021 --> 00:29:18.156
REALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT THIS IS

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:19.791
GOING TO LIMIT THEIR FLEXIBILITY

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:26.364
TO CONSIDER LOCAL CONTACTS AND

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:26.898
SET THAT NUMBER ACCURATELY

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:30.869
THANKS.

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:33.538
I FELT LIKE YOU FOR SECOND.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:36.274
ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION.

00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:36.841
CASINO TO BRING IT BACK TO

00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:37.509
COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:40.245
AND CONCERNS.

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:40.812
SENATOR DRAWS.

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:42.647
YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:43.148
FOR BRINGING THIS SOME.

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:45.350
THIS FORWARD COULD YOU RESPOND

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:47.652
TO THE ISSUES RAISED -- ACTUALLY

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:48.319
OUT MY QUESTION WAS A LITTLE BIT

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:49.454
SIMILAR BUT I WAS GONNA ASK YOU

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:52.056
TO GIVE ME A EXAMPLE OF A

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.758
CONCRETE WAY IN WHICH THIS

00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:55.226
CHANGE.

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:56.194
HOW WOULD THAT ACTUALLY IN A

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:58.796
VERY SPECIFIC WAY HELP?

00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:00.798
STUDENTS UP BECAUSE I'LL HEAR

00:30:00.865 --> 00:30:02.534
FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT IT

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.002
COULD ACTUALLY HURT.

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:06.204
US STUDENTS AND I DON'T THINK

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:08.640
THEY'RE DOING IT WITH MALICE SIR --

00:30:08.706 --> 00:30:10.508
TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG

00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:15.013
SO COULD YOU THEY'RE SORT OF

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:17.615
CONNECTED THERE UP STORY THANK

00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:17.815
YOU.

00:30:17.882 --> 00:30:18.983
WE HAVE DONE VERY THOROUGH

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.718
RESEARCH ON MANY INSTITUTIONS

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:23.488
ACROSS THE STATE LOOKING AT THE

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:26.157
UC DATA AND CAL STATE DATA FOR

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:28.026
EXAMPLE HOW WE COMPARE THE UC

00:30:28.092 --> 00:30:29.194
COST OF ATTENDANCE FIGURES FOR

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.929
OFF AGAIN THIS IS JUST FOR OFF

00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:33.298
CAMPUS HOUSING -- OFF HAS OFF

00:30:33.364 --> 00:30:35.900
CAMPUS HOUSING COSTS TO YOU SEE

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:37.769
YOU THROUGH THE CSU SYSTEM I

00:30:37.835 --> 00:30:40.405
NEAR OR THE SAME COUNTY SAME

00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:41.839
REGION -- SO THAT WE CAN FIND

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:44.142
COMPARISONS WE FOUND OUT THAT.

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:46.211
WITHIN THE SEVEN COMPARISONS

00:30:46.277 --> 00:30:47.312
THAT WE DID ARGUE LOOK AT

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:49.847
BERKELEY EAST BAY SANTA CRUZ

00:30:49.914 --> 00:30:52.217
MONTEREY BAY I RIVERSIDE SAMBAR

00:30:52.283 --> 00:30:55.153
DINO SAN DIEGO SAN DIEGO -- TWO

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.187
CAMPUSES BURKE CLEAN UC SAN

00:30:56.254 --> 00:30:58.790
DIEGO HAVE HIGHER THAN THE CS

00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.091
USE OFF CAMPUS HOUSING FIGURES

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:02.794
BALL THE OTHER FIVE HAVE LOWER

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.796
OFF CAMPUS HOUSING THAN THE

00:31:04.862 --> 00:31:06.164
LOCAL CSU'S.

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:08.766
SO WE DO SEE DISCREPANCIES I'M

00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:11.035
EVEN BETWEEN THE UC'S AND THE CS

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:12.203
USE THAT ARE LITERALLY JUST

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.639
MILES APART FROM EACH OTHER.

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:17.342
AND SO WHAT WE WIND TO IS THAT

00:31:17.408 --> 00:31:19.444
WE WANT JUST TO HAVE AN ACCURATE

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.845
ASSESSMENTS TO STUDENTS CAN MAKE

00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:24.215
THE BEST FINANCIAL -- CHOICE

00:31:24.282 --> 00:31:29.053
WHEN IT AFFECTS IT COULD -- YOU

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.388
KNOW.

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:35.560
THE FACT HOW MUCH ONCE A TAKE

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:37.128
OUT.

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:38.696
DO THEY NEED TO TAKE OUT MORE

00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:39.264
LOANS DO THEY TAKE OUT LESS

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.633
LOANS AT THE END OF THE DAY WE

00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:43.401
WANT TO ADDRESS STUDENT DEBT WE

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:45.003
DON'T WANT STUDENTS TO INCUR

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:47.338
MORE DEBT THAN NEEDED -- BUT AT

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:47.939
THE SAME TIME WE WANT THEM TO

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:50.808
GET A STRONG FINANCIAL PACKAGE --

00:31:50.875 --> 00:31:52.410
THAT COULD HELP THEM COVER THESE

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:53.378
COSTS AND WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING

00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:54.679
WHICH INSTITUTION TO GO TO THEY

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:55.613
NEED TO KNOW WHAT WILL MY

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.649
FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE COVER WHAT

00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:58.750
WHAT I NEED TO PAY.

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:01.586
OUT OF POCKET AND THEN TURNING --

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:02.920
TO STUDENT LOANS AND

00:32:02.987 --> 00:32:04.255
UNFORTUNATELY WE THAT'S ALREADY

00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:05.990
A CRISIS THAT WE FACE NATION

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:09.160
WIDE SO AFTER DOING THOROUGH

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:10.628
RESEARCH -- WE FOUND OUT THE

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:11.362
FEDERAL HOUSING AND URBAN

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:12.497
DEVELOPMENT HAS CREATED THIS

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:15.133
FAIR MARKET RATE EACH YEAR SINCE

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:16.234
NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR UPDATING

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:18.503
THAT LIST -- BECAUSE SEVERAL

00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:20.071
SERVICES RELY ON THIS HIGH DATA

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:22.507
ALREADY ACROSS THE NATION AND

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:25.443
ITS UPDATED ANNUALLY WITH CENSUS

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.513
TRACKS AT ITS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:29.414
TO ANYONE.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.316
I SO YOU DON'T AYE WE HAVE

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:33.084
ACTUALLY SPOKEN -- TO THE

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:35.286
OPPOSITION AT LANES AND WERE

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:37.789
ALWAYS OPEN AND WILLING TO

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:39.424
FIGURE OUT A PATH FORWARD OR IF

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.192
THERE ISN'T AN EASY NESS WHERE

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:42.994
THEY FILLED IT STUDENTS WOULD BE

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:44.195
AFFECTED IN ANY WAY THAT IS

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:46.931
CERTAINLY NOT WHAT WE EVER WANT

HAPPY NIGHT.

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:49.000
I FEEL LIKE I RESISTED IT THE

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:49.901
OTHER DAY TEN YEARS AGO I

00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:57.008
GRADUATED FROM UC RIVERSIDE --

00:32:57.075 --> 00:33:01.546
AND AND THE COST OF HOUSING I

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:02.747
CONTINUES TO BE A NUMBER ONE

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:03.414
CONCERN FOR STUDENTS AND SO ALL

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:05.116
WE'RE LOOKING FORCE TRANSPARENCY.

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:07.318
ACCURACY AND THE CONSISTENCY --

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:09.287
THAT EVERY UNIVERSITY PUBLIC

00:33:09.354 --> 00:33:11.823
PRIVATE TAKE [inaudible]

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:15.259

00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:18.129

ACCOMPLISH HERE.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.973
BUT I THINK THAT -- WITH LOOK AT

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.942
SEARS IN THESE BASED ON ANALYSIS

00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:32.910
I MEAN IT'S DONE TRY ANNUALLY I

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:33.945
THINK THE FACT ALTHOUGH EVEN

00:33:34.011 --> 00:33:34.712
THOSE SUPPOSEDLY EVERY THREE

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:35.980
YEARS THE LAST ONES LIKE TEN

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.415
YEARS SO THAT.

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:38.182
THAT'S A BIT DISTURBING THE

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:39.851
TERMS OF SAYING THAT THAT SHOULD

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:41.052
BE USED AS THE MAIN BENCHMARK

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:43.020
WHICH I THINK IS. ONE OF THE

00:33:43.087 --> 00:33:44.155
REASONS FOR THIS BILL.

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:46.057
HIDE IS UPDATE MORE RECENTLY BUT

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:46.791
ONE HEARING FOR THE OPPOSITION

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:48.526
IT MAY NOT BE GRANULAR ENOUGH

00:33:48.593 --> 00:33:54.832
RATES OF THE REGION'S VERY LARGE --

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:58.469
AND YOU'RE AVERAGING OUT THEN

00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:00.071
THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT DEPENDING

00:34:00.138 --> 00:34:01.406
ON WHERE THE CAMPUS IS A BABY AN

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:02.173
AREA WHERE HOUSING IS MUCH MORE

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.643
COSTLY THAN THE AVERAGE AND

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:06.844
OTHER AREA WHAT.

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:12.316
SO -- YES -- SO I GUESS MY

00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:14.819
QUESTION IS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:16.287
GIVEN WHAT THE OPPOSITION'S

00:34:16.354 --> 00:34:18.656
REYES I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED VERY

00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:20.792
HARD ON THIS BILL I THINK.

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:21.392
YOU KNOW HOW THE TIDE VARIETY

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:23.561
MUCH MORE RECENT INFORMATION IT

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:25.696
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S OF PERHAPS

00:34:25.763 --> 00:34:26.264
STILL A BETTER BASS LINE.

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:31.436
DO YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE -- AT AT

00:34:31.502 --> 00:34:32.870
IN YOUR BILL PERHAPS.

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:33.771
TREATING SOME KIND OF

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:35.973
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CAMPUS TO BE

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.875
ABLE TO IN THAT BECAUSE THAT YOU

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:38.676
WRITE THESE IT TRIES FINANCIAL

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:41.913
AID A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS --

00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:43.881
AND IN TERMS OF BEGAN TRYING

00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.316
FRIDAY TRANSPARENCY ACCURATE

00:34:45.383 --> 00:34:47.218
INFORMATION -- SOME ABILITY FOR

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:49.020
CAMPUSES TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:50.855
USING THE MOST RECENT SEARS TO

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.523
THE HEAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.491
THAT THAT THAT MIGHT GIVE A

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:54.559
BETTER IDEA WHAT'S LOCALLY I I'M

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:55.660
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.328
DEAL THE GRANULARITY ISSUE THAT

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.430
WAS -- I THINK SORT OF RAISED BY

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:00.631
THE OPPOSITION AND BY ALSO

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:02.733

THE SURVEY MAY SOUND LIKE IT'S

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:04.302
WHAT IF YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:05.269
EVERY THREE YEARS THE HOUSING

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:06.804
MARKET CAN CHANGE A LOT THREE

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:08.272
YEARS SAYS THE LAST ONE WAS

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:09.340
ALMOST TEN YEARS EVEN THEY

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:09.707
SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:10.675
IT EVERY FEW YEARS IT DOESN'T

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:12.276
SOUND TO ME TO BE VERY VERY

00:35:12.343 --> 00:35:18.616
RELIABLE AND SO WE JUST DOING A

00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:20.618
PERCENTAGE ADJUSTMENT.

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:21.452
THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE AN

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:23.721

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:11.468
ISSUES THAT WERE.

00:46:11.535 --> 00:46:12.803
ADDRESSED AND DISCUSSED SINCE

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.538
THEN I I DO WANNA SAY BELIEVE

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.073
WE'VE BEEN AND CONTINUED

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.276
COMMUNICATION -- BUT I GUESS BUT

00:46:19.343 --> 00:46:21.712
SOME OF THE LANGUAGE HAVING TO

00:46:21.778 --> 00:46:23.147
DO WITH.

00:46:23.213 --> 00:46:26.150
VARIOUS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS ON

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:27.684
BEHALF OF THE BILL -- WHO MAY

00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:29.586
RUN CONTRARY TO SOME OF THE

00:46:29.653 --> 00:46:31.288
INTERESTS?

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:32.656
THAT THAT THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO

00:46:32.723 --> 00:46:33.257
SOME OF THE CONCERNS

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:33.557
[inaudible]

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.459
CARE.

00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:36.627
THAT'S I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR

00:46:36.693 --> 00:46:38.962
QUESTION.

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:41.899

END UP HAVING MANY ORGANIZATIONS

00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:48.172
THAT SUPPORT.

00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:49.573
A BILL.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.241
AND SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.510
INVOLVED MAY BE IN DIRECT

00:46:53.577 --> 00:46:54.845
CONTRAST THING VIEWPOINT.

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:57.481
WITH FORMER OPPOSITION.

00:46:57.548 --> 00:46:58.749
I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE CONCERN

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:00.150
IS COMING FROM NOT KNOWING

00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:01.818
EXACTLY WHAT.

00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:02.953
SOME OF THE SET UP OF WITH THE

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.855
POTENTIAL PRIVATE FUNDS BEING

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:06.957
USED. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:09.026
THIS BILL -- I THINK THERE'S

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:11.428
CONCERN THAT WELL HOW WILL THESE

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:12.796
FUNDS BE USED AND WHAT.

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:14.231
DOCTOR AND WILL THEY BE

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:15.832
UTILIZING THAT IN SCHOOLS EIGHT

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:17.434
THAT'S WHERE THE CONCERN IS

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:19.503
COMING FROM.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:20.170
WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN MAY I

00:47:20.237 --> 00:47:21.238
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHO EVEN

00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:21.872
MAKES THAT DECISION OF SOME WAS

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:24.441
A PRIVATELY FUNDED FOR SCHOOLS

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:27.010
HOW DOES HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK.

00:47:27.077 --> 00:47:29.379
IF WHO MAKES THE DECISION.

00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:31.815
BECAUSE IT.

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:35.018
CAN YOU CAN YOU.

SHISEIDO.

YOUR GOOD IT'S ON THANK YOU.

00:47:44.928 --> 00:47:46.263
SO -- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS IS

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.264
THE MAN AND WHAT WAS PUT IN TO

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:49.833
ALLOW -- PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.236
AND INDIVIDUALS TO PROVIDE FUNDS

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:53.470
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:55.172
OKAY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM.

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:56.773

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.975
THINK WE'VE WE'VE EXPRESSED THE

00:47:58.041 --> 00:47:59.343
CITY OFFERS OFFICE SENSES

00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:00.010
AMENDMENTS WERE MADE.

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:02.579
THAT THERE'S REALLY NO GUARANTEE.

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:05.816
THAT THERE IS WON'T BE -- YOU

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:10.821
KNOW ANY ANY BIAS OR INFORMATION

00:48:10.887 --> 00:48:12.522
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY NUTRITION

00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:15.025
BASED -- THAT THAT WILL BE USED

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:17.728
TO PROMOTE THAT MOVING FORWARD --

00:48:17.794 --> 00:48:19.329

THIS PRIVATE FUNDS UTILIZED --

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:24.034
IT'S IT'S JUST A VERY BROAD

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:25.002
PROVISION THAT'S IN THE BILL

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.436
THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS THEM TO

00:48:26.503 --> 00:48:27.871
ACCEPT PRIVATE FUNDS TO

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:29.273
REIMBURSE SCHOOLS.

00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:32.376
THAT CHOOSE -- TO TO USE -- TO

00:48:32.442 --> 00:48:34.711
USE THIS OPTION SO I GUESS PART

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.013
OF IT IS ALSO JUST THAT THE FOR

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:38.181

IS VERY BROAD WITH REALLY NO

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:41.285
CONSTRAINTS OR FOR OR LIMITING

FRAME FOR LIVING AROUND THE

00:48:42.152 --> 00:48:43.053
FRAMEWORK.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.588
THAT PROVIDES US WITH WITH THAT

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:46.089
CONCERN MOVING MOVING FORWARD IF

00:48:46.156 --> 00:48:46.890
THE AUTHOR SO INCLINED WOULD YOU

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:48.458
BE WILLING TO CONTINUE HAVE

00:48:48.525 --> 00:48:50.127
DISCUSSIONS ON THAT YEAH I THINK

00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:51.328
WE HAVE AND WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:52.996
WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.398
THE AUTHORS OFFICE SENSE ABOUT

00:48:54.464 --> 00:48:55.599
ARC THAT CONCERNED -- SO FAR

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:56.833
THERE'S NOT BEEN A DESIRE TO

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:57.901
ADDRESS THAT CONCERN BUT IF

00:48:57.968 --> 00:48:59.403
THERE WAS AT SOME POINT -- WE

00:48:59.469 --> 00:49:00.337
WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:01.672
SIT DOWN AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST

00:49:01.738 --> 00:49:02.806
WE HAVE BEEN.

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:04.107
OPERATING AND GO SHOOTING GOOD

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:07.277
FAITHON THIS BILL AND SO I

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:07.878
THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE OPEN TO

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:09.413
CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:10.681
THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR I DO

00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:14.384
BELIEVE THAT IT'S C. D. E. THAT

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:17.254
WOULD MAKE THE DECISION.

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:19.756
YEAH CAT IF THAT WOULD HELP YEAH

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:21.658

00:49:21.725 --> 00:49:25.495
GOOD ASSEMBLY SENATOR DRUG SO.

00:49:25.562 --> 00:49:27.030
YEAH I I'M NOT SURE HOW TO IF

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:27.664
THERE'S A FIX FOR THIS BUT ONE

00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:28.832
THING THAT THE GENTLEMAN SAID

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:29.232
THAT DID.

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:31.268
GET MY ATTENTION IS THAT DOES

00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:33.370
THIS BECOME A BIAS -- YOU KNOW

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:34.271
AGAINST OTHER FOODS -- AND I

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:35.472
WOULD BE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:37.341
THAT IT'S ONE THING TO

00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:39.209
ACCOMMODATE AND PROVIDE CHOICES

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:41.111
BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I GO TO

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:43.213
CERTAIN GROCERY STORES AND MY

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.047
COMMUNITY.

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:47.351
WE ARE NOT PROVIDED THE CHOICES

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:50.454
AND FRANKLY I DO A MIX OF THINGS

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.723
YOU KNOW IT'S A TRY TO GET MORE.

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:54.424
VEGETABLES YEAR IN THERE AND ALL

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.927
THAT BUT I DO GET A MIX UP I

00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:59.162
LIKE THE CHOICES AND SO I WOULD

00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:01.965
WANT THIS TO BECOME THAT WERE.

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:04.201
SLOWLY MOVING IN WITH CERTAIN

00:50:04.267 --> 00:50:06.670
FOODS AND A TO THE DETRIMENT OF

00:50:06.737 --> 00:50:10.173
NOT OFFERING OTHER FOODS SO AND

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.376
I THAT.

00:50:12.442 --> 00:50:13.944
COULD HAPPEN I MEAN THERE'S VERY --

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.612
SERIOUS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.848
FOR EXAMPLE A BUDGETARY AND BE

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:22.219
GOOD AND THEN MEAT EATERS SO.

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:22.953
THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE BUT I I

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:24.621
APPRECIATE THAT.

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:25.555
THIS IS ALSO ADDRESSING

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:27.724
RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL ISSUES

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:28.925
AND CONCERNS SO.

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:32.829
I'M FOR IT BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE

00:50:32.896 --> 00:50:33.563
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO IN THE

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:37.968
OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE NINE

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:40.704
OTHER FOODS -- IN THIS PROCESS.

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:42.873
THANK YOU SO.

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:44.941
LET ME LET ME JUST.

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:46.276
TRY.

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:47.411
TO GIVE A AS AS SPACE BRIEF OF A

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:49.613
RESPONSE.

00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:50.881
PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:51.915
ACHIEVE WITH THIS IS CHANGE A

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.417
CULTURE.

00:50:53.483 --> 00:50:54.618
BECAUSE WHAT'S BEEN

00:50:54.684 --> 00:50:56.420
INSTITUTIONALIZED OVER TIME.

00:50:56.486 --> 00:50:58.889
ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF FOODS THAT

00:50:58.955 --> 00:51:01.725
HAVE BEEN -- SUBSIDIZED BY

00:51:01.792 --> 00:51:02.993
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:04.528
AND HAVE BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED

00:51:04.594 --> 00:51:07.097
IN THE PROCESS.

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.498
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:10.934
IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:12.669
A LARGE GROWING POPULATION SOME

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:13.837
OF THOSE EFFORTS NEEDED TO BE

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:14.905
PUT INTO PLACE.

00:51:14.971 --> 00:51:16.473
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT ONCE

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.975
THAT HAPPENS.

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:21.278
THEN OVER TIME SOME THINGS ARE

00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:22.379
NEGLECTED.

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:25.048
AND SO THIS IS AN EFFORT TO TRY

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:26.983
TO JUST DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:28.985
ARE OTHER OPTIONS.

00:51:29.052 --> 00:51:30.687
AND FOR CHILDREN SCHOOL AGE

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:32.889
STUDENTS TO BECOME BETTER

00:51:32.956 --> 00:51:33.990
INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.792
CONSUMING.

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:38.228
IT'S NOT EVEN FORCING THEM. TO

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:40.363
EAT IT IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:41.598
THEY DON'T HAVE.

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:43.300
TO IT'S BASICALLY.

00:51:43.366 --> 00:51:45.569
FOR REQUIRING SCHOOLS AT LEAST

00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:47.003
OFFER THE OPTION.

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.438
SO THAT THEN STUDENTS CAN BE

00:51:48.505 --> 00:51:49.940
BETTER INFORMED AND KNOW FOR

00:51:50.006 --> 00:51:51.408
THEMSELVES IF THEY WANT TO

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:53.210
PARTICIPATE OR NOT.

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:54.611
THAT'S REALLY THE GOAL NOW.

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:56.746
PRIVATELY FUNDING SOMETHING WE

00:51:56.813 --> 00:51:58.815
CONSTANTLY DO THAT WE CONSTANTLY

00:51:58.882 --> 00:52:00.116
GET INTO PUBLIC PRIVATE

00:52:00.183 --> 00:52:01.885
PARTNERSHIPS.

00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:04.020
IN ORDER BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:52:04.087 --> 00:52:06.022
ENOUGH FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:07.324
MEET THE NEEDS THAT.

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:10.293
OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND SO WE

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.995
USUALLY SET UP A PILOT PROJECT

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:14.464
PROJECT AND WE GARNER PRIVATE

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:16.833
SUPPORT SO THAT WE CAN HELP.

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.669
MOVE OR ADVANCE A CERTAIN ISSUE

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:22.305
FORWARD THIS IS.

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:23.807
THIS IS BASICALLY DOING THAT

00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:24.374
WHAT'S ALLOWING FOR THAT TO

00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:26.309
HAPPEN.

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:27.611
MINOR OFFER SOMETHING AS AN

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:29.913
OPERATIONAL POINT OF VIEW OUR

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.214
JOB IS TO FEED.

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:33.216
STUDENTS AND IF WE ARE CREATING

00:52:33.283 --> 00:52:34.818
A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT SATISFY

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:37.320
THE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS.

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:38.688
THEN THAT'S WHEN WE'RE FAILING

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:41.191
AND SO RIGHT NOW WE STRUGGLE TO

00:52:41.258 --> 00:52:42.993
DO THAT INTO OLD EMILY WE'RE

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:44.661
STILL GOING TO BE PROVIDING FOOD

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:46.429
THAT EVERY CHILD WANTS IN THIS

ALTHOUGH THIS MEASURE HAS THE

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:27.116
BEST INTENTIONS.

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:28.384
IT WOULD UNDERMINE OUR STATE'S

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:29.451
COMMITMENT TO PREVENT YOUTH

WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.305
CHANGING THIS BILL FROM WHEN IT

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:51.640
WAS FIRST INTRODUCED.

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:53.575
BUT WE STILL HAVE SOME SERIOUS

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:55.210
PROBLEMS WITH THIS PROPOSAL.

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:57.079
FIRST ORGANIZATION A JET OF

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.248
CHECKS TO THE AUTHOR GIVING A

01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:00.683
PRIVATE ORGANIZATION THAT

SUPPORTS HIS CAMPAIGN PLANNED

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:03.485
PARENTHOOD.

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:05.621
THE BILL OF THE TO USE THIS LAW

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:07.656
TO PROMOTE ITSELF TO MILLIONS OF

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:10.926
PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS AND

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.561
COLLEGE STUDENTS.

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:13.228
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THIS BILL WILL

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:14.363
GIVE A LOT OF FREE ADVERTISING

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.764
TO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE PLANNED

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:17.032
PARENTHOOD.

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:18.133
THAT IS GOING TO MAKE OTHER

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.602
PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS JEALOUS I

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:22.137
CAN IMAGINE IN THE COMING YEARS

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:24.273
MANY PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:26.175
GIVING MONEY TO POLITICIANS.

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:27.810
IN HOPES THAT THEIR PRODUCT HOT

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:29.945
LINES GET MANDATED IN THE PUBLIC

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.146
AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS.

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:32.848
THIS IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE USE

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:34.850
OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES WE ALSO

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.652
BELIEVE THIS BILL VIOLATES THE

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:38.420
FREE SPEECH RIGHTS OF PRO LIFE

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:41.056
STUDENTS WITHIN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:42.658
BY FORCING THEM TO DISPLAY

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:44.293

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:46.161
THEIR POCKETS AND ID CARD THAT

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:48.864
ADVERTISES FOR ABORTION SERVICES.

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:51.166
IN CONTRADICTION TO THEIR

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:52.267
SINCERELY HELD BELIEFS.

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:54.737
AND LASTLY THIS BILL STILL

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:56.505
COMPELS PRIVATE SCHOOLS TO

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:57.940
COMMUNICATE A GOVERNMENT

01:12:58.006 --> 01:12:59.975
SPONSORED MESSAGE BY REQUIRING

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:01.677

PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS ON STUDENT

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:04.780
NINETIES.

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:06.081
THE SUPREME COURT RECENTLY

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:08.016
INVALIDATED THE CALIFORNIA FACT

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:10.385
ACT FOR THE SAME TYPE OF

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:11.920
GOVERNMENT COMPELLED SPEECH

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:13.455
CALLING IT A VIOLATION OF FIRST

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:14.923
AMENDMENT.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:17.025
AND THIS BILL IS NO DIFFERENT.

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.127
I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:20.562
AUTHOR REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:22.998
THAT RELIGIOUS PRIVATE SCHOOLS --

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.134
DON'T HAVE TO PRINT THE SEXUAL

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.535
AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH HOTLINE

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:29.004
ON ID CARDS HE RECOGNIZED A

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.806
COMPELLING A RELIGIOUS SCHOOL TO

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:32.674
PROMOTE A MESSAGE IT DISAGREES

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:33.809
WITH.

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:35.410
VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION.

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:37.112
BUT ALL THE GOVERNMENT COMPELLED

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:38.747
SPEECH VIOLATES THE FIRST

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:39.982
AMENDMENT.

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:42.084
IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THE SPEECH

ORGANIZATIONS ARE PRIVATE FOR A

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:52.394
REASON.

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:54.496
THE CONTENT THEY GIVE TO THEIR

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:55.831

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:57.766
A BEHAVIOR COME FROM THEM ALONE

01:13:57.833 --> 01:13:59.134
AND THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE

01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:00.402
MANDATING THESE MESSAGES ON

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:02.271

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:49.897
UNBELIEVABLE.

01:27:49.964 --> 01:27:51.165
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US CAN

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:52.867
IMAGINE IT'S HORRIBLE TO IMAGINE

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.102
BEING INCARCERATED.

01:27:54.168 --> 01:27:55.870
IT'S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:57.505
IMAGINE BEING INCARCERATED FOR

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:59.173
SOMETHING YOU DID NOT DO.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.142

THEIR SPOUSES HAVE DIVORCED --

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:12.253
THEIR FAMILIES HAVE MOVED AWAY

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.455
THEIR PARENTS HAVE DIED YOU KNOW

A STATE WE DON'T EVEN SAY I'M

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:23.631

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:24.365

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.043
THE OTHER DAY.

01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:36.778

FROM YOU WHAT ABOUT THE JUDGE

YOU DIDN'T CONSIDER CERTAIN

01:28:41.783 --> 01:28:43.317
THINGS WHAT ABOUT THE DISTRICT

01:28:43.384 --> 01:28:44.152
ATTORNEY AND WITH THE WHOLE IS?

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:44.952
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE PEOPLE

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:45.787
WHO INTENTIONALLY HELD

01:28:45.853 --> 01:28:48.489
INFORMATION EVERY LAST ONE OF

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:50.291
HAS BEEN PROMOTED UP THE LINE?

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:52.460
THE JUDGES NOW AIDED DEALING

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:53.661
WITH THE HE'S ON THE COURT OF

SO NOTHING NEGATIVE IS HAPPEN TO

01:28:58.566 --> 01:29:00.535
THOSE FOLKS WHO INTENTIONALLY

AND SO WHEN YOU SEE THESE THINGS

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:05.707
IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO THE TO

01:29:05.773 --> 01:29:06.874
MATCH AND OUR SYSTEM DOES THIS

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:08.142

01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:09.143
RETURN.
