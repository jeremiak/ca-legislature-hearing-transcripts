YEP HELLO THANK YOU DR COURT MY NAME IS JEFF TARKOVSKY AND I AM THAT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AS THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WORKS TO IMPLEMENT THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM. THE BOARD HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL STATUTORY CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO HELP COMMUNITIES MORE QUICKLY. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX TO AUTHORIZE THE WATER BOARD TO ISSUE A SINGLE ORDER TO REQUIRE MULTIPLE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS TO CONDUCT MONITORING OR PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE BOARD. THIS IS AN EFFICIENCY MEASURE TO SAVE RESOURCES AND WILL HELP SUPPORT MONITOR AND ENSURE STATE WATER QUALITY AND PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THAT REQUIRE ASSISTANCE. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FIVE SIX. WHICH GAVE THE BOARD AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE ALL OR ANY GROUP OF WATER SYSTEMS TO MONITOR FOR P. TAX. THIS BILL WILL ALSO ALIGN THE WATER BOARD'S DRINKING WATER AUTHORITIES WITH ITS WATER QUALITY AUTHORITY. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX ALLOWS THE WATER BOARD TO ADOPT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THAT WILL HELP THE BOARD TAKE QUICK ACTION IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT DATA IS READILY AVAILABLE AND IT'S A KEEPING WITH OUR EXISTING AUTHORITIES. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WILL IT STAND THE WATER PORTS AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE TECHNICAL REPORTS FROM STATE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. THIS WILL ENSURE SAFE DRINKING WATER IN SMALL SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITIES. AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE BOARD'S CURRENT AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE THIS INFORMATION FROM A LARGER PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WILL ALSO ALLOW THE WATER BOARD TO ADDRESS EMERGENCY SITUATIONS THAT OCCUR AT A FAILING WATER SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY THE BOARD WOULD BE AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WITHOUT A WRITTEN AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO ADDRESS A DRINKING WATER EMERGENCY. FOR EXAMPLE TO PROVIDE BOTTLED WATER. THE BILL WILL ALSO AUTHORIZE THE BOARD TO MAKE ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO ENTITIES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED TO RECEIVE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUNDS. THE WATER BOARD GENERALLY MAKES PAYMENTS ON A REIMBURSEMENT BASIS HOWEVER THIS PROCESS CAN BE A FINANCIAL BURDEN PARTICULARLY ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE THE CASH FLOW UP FRONT. THIS WILL HELP SMALL COMMUNITIES ACCESS SAFE WATER MORE QUICKLY. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX INCLUDES AN EXEMPTION FROM CERTAIN STATE CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM. OF NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATE AT THE FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM AND PROVIDED THE BOARD WITH THIS EXEMPTION. SB TWO HUNDRED HOWEVER FAILED TO INCLUDE SECTION EXEMPTIONS. THIS BILL WILL WIND THE EXEMPTIONS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET ACT WITH THE INTENT OF SB TWO HUNDRED.

TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LARGE INFORMED FIFTY YEARS. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY STATEMENT SO WE AS A GOVERNMENT NEED TO BE AS CREATIVE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO FIGURE IT OUT TO FIX IT AND TO BREAK DOWN THOSE ROADBLOCKS ONE OF THOSE ROADBLOCKS IS ARTIFICIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUNICIPAL WATER AGENCIES AND STORM WATER AGENCIES STORMWATER AS WAS INDICATED IN THE AND THE AND THE IN THE SUPPORT LETTER FROM THE OCEAN STOP- BECAUSE KEEPERS. IS A VALUABLE RESOURCE WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO CAPTURE THAT RESOURCE I INTRODUCED A BILL THAT WAS QUITE CONTROVERSIAL SOME YEARS AGO TWO THIRTY ONE INVOLVING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN WATER AND STORMWATER WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ALLOWS BECAUSE THE LAW THERE'S A EXCUSE NO DISRESPECT SIR BUT THERE'S A QUIRK IN THE LAW. THAT REQUIRES A CHANGE BECAUSE OF THIS DISTINCTION SO TO MAKE IT EASY THERE'S ONLY FOUR DISTRICTS TO DO THIS NOW TO ALLOW VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS TO BE ENTERED INTO.

I'M HANDS AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. THANK YOU. YEAH OKAY MANY. ANALYSTS WITH MEDICARE AND THEN- NICE WALKING OVER HERE WAS VERY MUCH TRYING TO GET CLOSE TO THE MIKE BUT MIKE MASCOT. PRECIADO BUT I GOT A PHONE CALL IT MIGHT BE THIS BILL SB SIX HUNDRED MIGHT BE IN CONFLICT WITH PROP. TO EIGHTEEN DO YOU FEEL OF SOME CONFLICT WITH TWO EIGHT TWO ONE SIX PRESS WITH ALL THE SUPPORT THAT'S THE DEBATE WE HAD SOME YEARS AGO INVOLVING S. B. TWO THIRTY ONE WHICH DEBT DEFINE STORM WATER NO I DON'T THINK SO. I KNOW THAT THERE'S AN ARGUMENT IN THAT IN THAT RESPECT AND THERE WAS A COURT CASE IN SALINAS IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WITH RESPECT TO THAT ISSUE. AND IT'S GOING TO BE LITIGATED AGAIN AND I'M SURE THAT WE WITH A WILL BUT- BUT THE IDEA IS- THIS ALLOWS FOR VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT SO IT'S SUSPECTED WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS. THE WATER LAWYERS ON LIKE A STATUTORY MANDATE THAT WE DID ON TWO THIRTY ONE- I CAN'T WROTE YOUR THAT WAS. BUT IS QUITE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE LAWYERS WILL DRAFT THIS IN A WAY TO AVOID LITIGATION RISK IT'S A DIFFERENT THANK. BECAUSE THE QUESTION AS WELL THIS WATER STORMWATER AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU ADD A FEATURE TO IT WELL THOSE ARE GOING TO BE QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE WILL BE- NETTED OUT WITH RESPECT TO THE LAWYERS WHEN THEY- DRAFT THESE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WITH THE FEE STRUCTURE IS HOW THOSE CHARGES ARE MADE. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT CREATE THE CHALLENGES IN PROP TO EIGHTEEN WHICH THE HOWARD JARVIS FOLKS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN THEY HAD LITIGATION SALINAS VERSUS HOWARD JARVIS BACK IN NINETY EIGHT. MAYBE WAS EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBERS ANYMORE BUT THE POINT IS THAT I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE A PROBLEM PERFECT THANK YOU LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORT IT ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. EXCELLENT AND THEN- MR MURATSUCHI THANK YOU SIR I I'M HEARING ALL THESE. GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOUR. BILL BUT I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND UP- MAKE SURE AND- IT IS A FROM THE PRESS OF THE STORM WATER TREATMENT COSTS I KNOW THAT MY CITIES IN THE SOUTH BAY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY ARE YOU KNOW EVER SINCE I ARRIVED HERE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW. THE THE REQUIREMENTS THE CLEAN- CLEAN AND TREAT THE STORMWATER RUNOFF IS SO OVERWHELMING THAT- THAT THEY THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT HOW IS THIS BILL GOING TO- HELLO THIS IS DAVID THE PROBLEM L. A. COUNTY PARTICULARLY COMMITTEES REPRESENT. WAS THESE NPDES PERMITS- THAT ARE REQUIRED IN THE COSTA COUNTY PASSED TONIGHT I DIDN'T REALLY SUPPORTED THOUGHT HOW THEY DONE IT WAS WRONG THIS HUGE OBLIGATION THINKING COULD BE AS MUCH AS TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IMPOSE PARTICULAR IN SMALLER CITIES YOUR CITIES GLENDORA SOME OF THE CITY'S REALLY HAD ITS REAL CHALLENGE WITH THAT SOME YEARS AGO WHEN THAT PASS AND I GET. OFF ON BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT THESE PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS MY CONCERN WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT YEAR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS A VERY I THINK AS- THE SEVEN ABOUT QUE HAN SAID IS KIND OF AN ELEGANT SOLUTION BECAUSE- WHAT'S HAPPENING IS. THAT THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED THE IT IS THE BOND ISSUES PASSED IN LOS ANGELES TALK ABOUT REQUIRING CLEANUP CAPPED IT TAKE RUN OFF CLEAN. IT UP AND TOWARD THE OCEAN RIGHT. YEAH THIS ANY OF THIS- LOOKING YOU GOTTA HOLD OF YOU HEAD WHY NOT. THAT WATER. THAT WERE CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR THE FARMERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE'RE CAUSING FOR PROBLEMS WITH WITH WITH LAKE MADE AT THE RIVER AND ALL THE STUFF IS GONE SALTON CITY. WERE CAUSING PROBLEMS IN THE NORTH. WE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE TO CAPTURE EVERY DROP OF WATER PARTICULARLY THAT CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING IN THE DROUGHT. SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS MEASURE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT HAPPENED. UNDER THE BOND ISSUE THE THAT YOU'RE CITIES WERE SO UPSET ABOUT. IS THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY CAPTURE AND MAKE MONEY RIGHT TO RECYCLE THAT WATER TO RECHARGE THE GROUNDWATER WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT. METROPOLITAN WATER IS THE ONLY COUNTY IS INCREDIBLE MAP WHICH ON THE DOOR OF MY OFFICE MY DISTRICT WHICH SHOWS ALL THE PLACES THROUGHOUT BOTH ORANGE COUNTY L. A. COUNTY. WELL WE CAN RECHARGE THE GROUNDWATER. TO ELIMINATE THESE LARGER PROBLEMS WE SHOULD RESTRUCTURE WATER POLICY IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY. AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE FACING SUCH AN EXTRA NEGATIVELY WHAT FACING THE DROP WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS. SO THIS DID THIS IS A THIS IS A STORY CORK IN THE LAW WHERE. WE'VE GOT THESE STUPID SILOS ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE OF HISTORICAL REASONS. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO BE CREATIVE COMING UP WITH WAYS. WHERE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN WORK TOGETHER SAY WATER AND ALSO POSSIBLY TAKE THAT WATER. THAT RIGHT NOW YOUR CITY HAS TO PAY TO PUT THE OCEAN MAYBE THEY COULD TURN INTO AN ASSET. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BUY WATER AT ELEVEN DOLLARS AN ACRE FOOT. THAT'S THE REASON SO IT'S A REALLY IT'S TO ME IT'S COMPLIMENTARY IT SHOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF. BUT YOUR POINT IS BRILLIANTLY TAKEN AND I AGREE WITH YOU AND I DIDN'T SUPPORT THAT WATER BOND THE TIME. PRECISELY FOR THAT REASON IS WE SHOULDN'T JUST SAY WE'RE GONNA CLEAN UP THE WATER WE SHOULD CLEAN IT UP AND CAPTURED BECAUSE IT'S CLEAN UP TO FEDERAL STANDARDS. FROM WHICH WE CAN THEN HAVE. PIPES BUILT A RECHARGE GROUNDWATER WHICH WOULD BE TELE POLICY WHICH IS ULTIMATELY WHAT I WANT TO GO IN THE WATER SPACE. SO STATE ABILITY. LESS RELIANCE LESS POLITICAL ARCHITECTURE. MORE HARMONY AMONG FOLKS IN THE WATER WORLD SILICIFIED BY ENCOURAGING THAT THE CAPTURE. AND THE TREATMENT FOR. PURPOSES LIKE RECHARGING THE- AQUIFER OR- ARE USING IT FOR. FOR IRRIGATION OR OTHER PURPOSES. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE THE COSTS TO. MY CITIES IN TERMS OF COURSE THEY THAT THE TREATMENT- SURE IT'S A REVENUE STREAM. OR TAKE A MESSAGE YOU'RE IN YOU'RE YOU'RE BEING MANDATED TO PUT IN THE OCEAN. YOU KNOW. I MEAN IT'S TERMINAL BOX ROCKS I JUST IT JUST CRAZIER THAN TO ME. BUT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE BEHIND IT WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL PIECE THEY WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT THE WATER SUPPLY PIECE AND THE OTHER PIECE OF SUSTAINABILITY. AND ALSO THE POLITICS OF WATER FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH AS WE ALL KNOW. WHISKEY'S FOR DRINKING A WATER FIGHT OVER. AND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM. AND WE NEED TO BE SMART ABOUT IT IN PARTICULAR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'RE BOTH FROM. WE GOTTA BE DOUBLY SMART. ABOUT IT. OKAY THANK YOU. I HAVE NEVER HAD AN AUTHOR. WHO KNEW MORE ABOUT THIS BILL. GEN YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG. SO AGAIN THESE ARE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS UP OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.
