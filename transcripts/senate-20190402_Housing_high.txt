SENATE BILL -- FIFTY THE MORE HOMES ACT. SB FIFTY ADDRESSES ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL OBSTACLES TO HAVING ENOUGH HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A SPECIFICALLY HYPER LOW DENSITY ZONING. THAT BANDS EVEN SMALL APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDINGS AND A HUGE MAJORITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HYPER LOW DENSITY ZONING OFTEN IN THE FORM OF BANNING AND PROHIBITING ALL FORMS OF HOUSING. OTHER THAN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA TO CLOSE OUR MASSIVE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOME DEFICIT. IT PERPETUATE SEGREGATION. IT PUSHES WORKING FAMILIES OUT OF COMMUNITIES AND INTO MULTI HOUR COMMUTES. IT INCREASES FREEWAY CONGESTION AND CARBON EMISSIONS. AND IT MAKES HOUSING BRUTALLY EXPENSIVE. SB FIFTY SETS BASIC STANDARDS FOR ZONING NEAR HIGH QUALITY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND IN JOB CENTERS. IT DOES SO BY LEGALIZING SMALL TO MID SIZE MULTI UNIT HOUSING IN AREAS THAT ARE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF HIGH QUALITY PUBLIC TRANSIT. AND JOB RICH AREAS. AND IT DOES SO LOG. ENSURING THAT CITIES CONTINUE TO HAVE LOCAL CONTROL OVER MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES. FOR EXAMPLE THE APPROVAL PROCESS. FOR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS CITIES WILL RETAIN THAT FULL CONTROL. WHETHER SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; CONDITIONAL&lt;/c&gt;</u> USE DISCRETIONARY APPEAL DESIGN STANDARDS. RULES AROUND DEMOLITIONS RESTRICTIONS ON DEMOLITIONS. ALL LOCAL CONTROL UNDER THIS BILL. THESE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE. TO CREATED IMPOSE IMPACT FEES WHETHER FOR TRANSPORTATION OR SEWERS OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND CITIES WILL CONTINUE. TO BE ABLE TO IMPOSE SETBACK REQUIREMENTS MANY MANY ASPECTS OF LOCAL LAND USE ON THEIR SB FIFTY WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNDER LOCAL CONTROL -- AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS COLLEAGUES. THE COALITION SUPPORTING THIS BILL. IS BROAD AND DIVERSE. IT'S ONE OF THE FEW BILLS THAT I'VE SEEN. WITH ENDORSEMENTS FROM BOTH TE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE YOU DON'T SEE THAT VERY OFTEN. OUR INTEREST IS ALSO INCLUDE THE BUILDING TRADES. NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDERS WHO BUILD. SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FOR OUR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE UC STUDENTS ASSOCIATION. A A RP HABITAT FOR HUMANITY DISABILITY RIGHTS RGANIZATIONS AND A GROWING LIST OF MAYORS COUNTY SUPERVISORS AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. WHO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM? ISN'T WORKING AND NEEDS REFORM. AND THE BILL'S SIXTEEN CO AUTHORS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE. INCLUDE SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE'S MOST LIBERAL PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS. AND SOME OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS. SHOWING ONCE AGAIN THAT HOUSING IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. WHETHER RED OR BLUE. OUR COMMUNITIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOUSING. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS BILL. ABOUT HOW IT'S A SUPPOSE IT COMPLETE STATE TAKEOVER OF LOCAL LAND USE. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. AS I JUST DESCRIBED SB FIFTY RETAINS ENORMOUS LOCAL DECISION MAKING. BUT IN ONE AREA OF STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE DENSITY NEAR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND JOBS. IT SETS A BASIC STANDARD. OTHERS HAVE CLAIMED THAT SB FIFTY IS AN ATTACK ON SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. THAT IS ALSO INACCURATE. NOTHING IN SENATE BILL FIFTY PREVENTS ANYONE FROM BUILDING OR LIVING AND A SINGLE FAMILY HOME. SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. IN MY VIEW OR A GOOD THING. BUT SO OUR APARTMENT BUILDINGS. SB FIFTY ALLOWS SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. BUT IT MOVES US AWAY FROM MANDATING THAT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ARE THE ONLY THING. FEDERAL OUT TO BE BUILT -- NEAR TRANSIT OUR JOBS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD VARIOUS KINDS OF HOUSING NOT JUST ONE TYPE. SO WHY FOCUS ON ZONING DENSITY NEAR TRANSCEND JOBS. WALL ZONING ISN'T THE ONLY IMPEDIMENT. TO CALIFORNIA MEDIAN HOUSING NEEDS WE ALSO NEED FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE NEED STRONGER TENANT PROTECTIONS. WE NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO HELP CITIES ENGAGE IN GOOD PLANNING AND SO FORTH. ZONING IS FOUNDATIONAL. YOU CAN UP ALL OF THE INVESTMENT AND STREAMLINING IN THE WORLD. BUT IF IT'S A LEGAL IF IT IS PROHIBITED TO BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING. THEN YOU'RE SORT OF STOCK. AND 80% APPROXIMATELY OF THE RESIDENTIAL LEASE ON LAND IN CALIFORNIA AND ABOUT 70% EVEN IN BIG CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES. IT IS ILLEGAL TO BUILD ANYTHING OTHER THAN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME OR MAYBE A TWO UNIT BUILDING. THAT MANS IT'S ILLEGAL TO BUILD EVEN A THREE FOUR FIVE OR SIX UNIT SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING ILLEGAL IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA. THAT MEANS IT'S ILLEGAL TO BUILD MULTI UNIT SENIOR HOUSING. ILLEGAL TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS BECAUSE THAT IS INHERENTLY MULTI UNIT. AND WHAT DOES THIS RESTRICTIVE ZONING MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA. THAT MAKES IT ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO CLOSE OUR THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOME DEFICIT. IT'S BASIC MATH. IF YOU SAY THAT YOU CAN ONLY BUILD ONE UNIT PER PARCEL IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MEET YOUR HOUSING GOALS AD IF YOU DO. YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT BY CREATING MORE AND MORE SPRAWL COVERING UP FARMLAND AND OPEN SPACE AND CLOGGING OUR FREEWAYS AN INCREASING CARBON EMISSIONS. AND CREATING A GROWING CLASS OF SUPER COMMUTERS WHO SPENT FOUR OR FIVE HOURS A DAY. ON THE ROAD. THIS HOUSING SHORTAGE WHICH IS SELF INFLICTED IN MANY WAYS HAS REAL LIFE CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE IT PUSHES PEOPLE IN THE POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. AT SPIKE'S EVICTIONS AND DISPLACEMENT. IT IT IS A PROBLEM AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS A AND WE WILL NEVER MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE PAPER LOW DENSITY ZONING NEAR JOBS IN TRANSIT. ALL WE WILL DO IS FORCE PEOPLE TO COMMUTE LONG HOURS. AND INCREASED CARBON EMISSIONS. SB FIFTY ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM IN A THOUGHTFUL AND BALANCED WAY. OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. A WE HAVE WORKED WITH A BROAD SPECTRUM OF STAKEHOLDERS. INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTENDED ADVOCATES. FOR PROFIT AND NOT FOR PROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPERS. ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS LABOR UNIONS STUDENTS RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND DISABILITY AND SENIOR ADVOCATES. TO CRAFT A BILL TO MOVE THE DIAL ON HOUSING. SO THAT WE MOVE AWAY FROM HOUSING ANXIETY AND TOWARD HOUSING ACTION. SB FIFTY PROVIDES AN AREAS WITHIN A HALF A MILE OF FIXED RAIL OR FERRIES STOPS. WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF A HIGH FREQUENCY BUS STOP WHICH MUST RUN FROM EARLY MORNING INTO THE NIGHT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AT A HIGH FREQUENCY. OR IN A JOB RICH AREA. THE CITY COULD NOT PUT AN ARBITRARY CAP ON DENSITY BY MANDATING FOR EXAMPLE ONLY ONE OR TWO UNITS ARE ALLOWED ON THE PARCEL. THE CITY ALSO CANNOT FORCE A HEIGHT LIMIT LOWER THAN FOUR OR FIVE STORIES. IN THE AREAS AROUND FIX RAIL OR FURRY. OF COURSE BASIC GEOMETRY AND THE BUILDING CODE PUT A NATURAL LIMIT ON DENSITY. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH SPACE AND THERE ARE BASIC REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE BUILDING CODE. BUT WE WILL MOVE AWAY FROM THE ARBITRARY NUMERICAL COPS. BOB PLEASE NOTE THAT I ORIGINALLY LAST YEAR HAD IN EACH STORY OPTION IN THE BILL AND WE REMOVED THAT. LISTENING TO CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK SOME THE SUMMER ON HAPPY THAT WE REMOVE THAT BUT SOME WERE VERY HAPPY -- AROUND THE BUS STOPS AND JOB RICH AREAS THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE ABILITY OF CITIES TO ENFORCE LOCAL HEIGHT LIMITS. MORE SETBACKS. SO IF THE LOCAL HEIGHT LIMIT IS THIRTY FEET THAT HEIGHT LIMIT WE WILL BE ADOPTED EFFECTIVELY BY SB. FIFTY BUT INSTEAD OF BEING MANDATED TO ONLY BUILD SINGLE FAMILY YOU COULD BUILD LET'S SAY THREE FLAT. MULTI UNIT OR SIX TWO PER STORY. THE BUILDING WOULD LOOK THE SAME FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE SAME HEIGHT SAME SETBACK BUT INSIDE IT WOULD HELL'S MORE FAMILIES. ALSO IN RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK FROM TEN ADVOCATES. THIS BILL NOW CONTAINS. AMONG THE STRONGEST PERHAPS THE STRONGEST TENER PROTECTIONS THAT EXIST UNDER STATE LAW. SPECIFICALLY. IF A TENANT HAS RESIDED ON THE PROPERTY AT ANY POINT IN TIME IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. YOU CANNOT GET A DEMOLITION PERMIT TO BUILD UNDER THIS BILL. EVEN IF YOUR LOCAL CITY WOULD ALLOW YOU TO HAVE THAT PERMIT THIS BILL SAYS YOU CAN'T USE THIS BILL. TO START THE POLICY INTENDED OCCUPIED BUILDINGS THE BILL FURTHER PROVIDES THAT IF IN ELLIS ACTIVE ACTION HAS OCCURRED ON THE PROPERTY. IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS YOU CANNOT INVOKE THIS BILL. OUR GOAL HERE IS TO BE ADDITIVE WITH HOUSING TO ADD THE HOUSING WE NEED NOT TO REPLACE EXISTING RESIDENTS. I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED AROUND DISPLACEMENT. WE HAVE EXPERIENCE OUT IN SAN FRANCISCO IT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE STATE -- AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE ARE ADDING THE HOUSING WE NEED WHICH WILL REDUCE DISPLACEMENT. BY STOPPING THIS RUN AWAY HOUSING MARKET. WHAT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY LIVING IN A COMMUNITY CAN STAY THERE? SB FIFTY REQUIRES THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BE A PART OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS. ABOVE A CERTAIN SIZE. LOCAL INCLUSIONARY WILL APPLY IF THERE IS NO LOCAL INCLUSIONARY. THAN THIS. PROVIDES AN INCLUSIONARY STRUCTURE -- FOR THESE PROJECTS. FINALLY -- SB FIFTY DIFFERS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL FOR FIVE YEARS. IN WHAT WE CALL IN THE BILL SENT QUOTE UNQUOTE SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES THE FIND IS NEIGHBORHOODS WITH SIGNIFICANT LOW INCOME POPULATIONS. WITH RISK OF DISPLACEMENT. SO THAT THESE COMMUNITIES CAN ENGAGE AND LOCAL ANTI DISPLACEMENT PLANNING. AND EXERCISE MORE FLEXIBILITY ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION -- IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. KNOWN IN TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL -- WHILE THE BILL AS I DSCRIBED LARGELY RETAINS LOCAL CONTROL. IT DOES MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STATE AND LOCAL DECISION MAKING BALANCE. JUST AS WE HAVE. A STATE LOCAL BALANCE AROUND PUBLIC EDUCATION. LOCAL CONTROL ISN'T BIBLICAL. LOCAL CONTROL IS A GOOD THING WHEN IT DELIVERS GOOD RESULTS AND IT USUALLY DOES DELIVER GOOD RESULTS AND I SAY THIS IS A FORMER LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL. BUT NOT ALWAYS. AND WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM OF ALMOST PURE LOCAL CONTROL. HASN'T WORKED WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH THAT SYSTEM. FIND TO REFORMAT SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AS A STATE. I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL IS A CONTINUING WORK IN PROGRESS. WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS OVER THE PAST YEAR OR SO WORKING NOT JUST WITH OUR SUPPORTERS BUT WITH OUR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICS PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE THE BILL LAST YEAR OR NEUTRAL. BUT WE'RE WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH US TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND WORK TOGETHER TOWARD SOLUTIONS -- AS YOU PROBABLY SAW A COALITION OF HOUSING PROGRESSIVE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS SENT IN A LETTER OF CONCERN. OUTLINING ISSUES ON WHICH THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK. I AM DEEPLY COMMITTED TO THAT WORK. WHILE I CAN NEVER GUARANTEE -- THAT WE WILL ALL END UP AGREEING ON A 100% OF EVERYTHING. AS I'VE SHOWN OVER THE PAST YEAR I'M WILLING TO LISTEN. EXCEPT CRITICISM AND FEEDBACK AND ADJUST THE BILL AND REASONABLE WAYS. INDEED THE TENET AND DEMOLITION PROTECTION IN THIS. PROTECTIONS IN THIS BILL WERE NEGOTIATED WITH SOME OF THE KEY SIGNERS OF THAT LETTER OF CONCERN SO I PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS WHEN IT COMES TO WORKING WITH PEOPLE. WHO AREN'T IN AGREEMENT? AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATOR MCGUIRE WHO IS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE IS NOT HERE RIGHT NOW WILL BE HERE SHORTLY -- I WANT TO THANK SENATOR MCGUIRE WHO ALSO OF COURSE CHAIRS THE NEXT COMMITTEE STOP -- FOR THIS BILL THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE -- CENTER MCGUIRE AND I CHAIR THE TWO COMMITTEES -- THAT HERE A LOT OF THE HOUSING -- BILLS IS DOUBLE REFERRALS -- WE AGREE ON MANY THINGS WE DON'T AGREE ON EVERYTHING WE HAVE SOME DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES -- BUT I THINK OUR PRO TEM IN -- SHE'S A VERY WISE PERSON IN HER IN HER WISDOM SHE APPOINTED TO TEARS WHO DON'T NECESSARILY SEE EYE TO EYE. ON EVERYTHING BECAUSE THAT OFTEN RESULTS IN STRONG BALANCED POLICY. SENATOR MCGUIRE AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING INTENSIVELY FOR AWHILE NOW. TO SEE TO WORK TOWARD. A SHARED APPROACH WHERE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER -- REGARDING SB FIFTY AND US BEFORE -- I KNOW THAT CENTER MCGUIRE AND I OR BOTH COMMITTED. TO DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN -- TO REACH A RESOLUTION -- COLLEAGUES WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE SUFFERING. AND THEY WANT THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES TO FIX THE PROBLEM. AND FRANKLY MOST OF THEM DON'T REALLY CARE WHETHER THE ELECTED OFFICIALS FIXING THE PROBLEM. ARE THE PEOPLE THEY VOTED FOR ON THE CITY COUNCIL LINE. FOR THE PEOPLE THEY VOTED FOR ON THE STATE SENATE OR ASSEMBLY LINE. THEY JUST WANT US TO FIX IT AND THEY DON'T CARE WHICH OF US IS ACTUALLY FIXING IT. THEY WANT US TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE THINGS BETTER REGARDLESS OF WHAT OUR TITLE IS. SB FIFTY IS CERTAINLY NOT THE COMPLETE SOLUTION. BUT IT IS PART OF THAT SOLUTION. COLLEAGUES I THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE -- WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY. H. O. GOV I WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE OF OUR BILL SPONSORS WHICH REPRESENTS A BROAD COALITION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS -- MICHAEL GUNNING WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND STATES ARE THE AS WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES THANK YOU. BUT I WANT TO ALSO SAY THE JOINING US TODAY. AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS BRIAN HAMMOND THE CEO CALIFORNIA U. M. B. -- ALSO ONE OF OUR SPONSORS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS PATRICK OF ALL AND I'M WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SB FIFTEEN AS A BOLD APPROACH TO ADDRESS OUR STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. BY PROMOTING INCLUSIVE GROWTH WHILE COMBATING RESTRICTIVE AND EXCLUSIONARY ZONING AND PROTECTING EXISTING AFFORDABILITY. NPH IS A FORTY YEAR OLD AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT WORKS AND ALL NINE BAY AREA COUNTIES. WE REPRESENT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MEMBERS WHICH INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS BUSINESSES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ORGANIZATIONS MISSION IS TO SEE A BAY AREA WHERE EVERYONE HAS AN AFFORDABLE AND STABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME. AND WE'RE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES CAN STATE AND PROSPER. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE BAY AREA IS AT THE EPICENTER FOR STATES HUMANITARIAN HOUSING EMERGENCY AND WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE SOLUTION IS MORE HOMES NOT MORE RESTRICTIONS. FOR MORE PERSPECTIVE AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WE ARE EXCITED BY SB FIFTIES HEIGHT INCREASES BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW CONSTRUCTION OF DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOMES. IN PLACES WHERE MULTI FAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WAS PREVIOUSLY NOT ALLOWED TO TO LOCAL HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS. ALLOWING MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES TO BE BUILT NEAR HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT WHICH RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESIDENTS RIGHT MORE. THAN WERE THOSE HOMES LOCATED ELSEWHERE -- SB FIFTY ALSO INCLUDES A 15225% INCLUSIONARY HOUSING COMPONENT DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT SIZE AND RESPECTS LOCAL INCLUSIONARY PROGRAMS IF THEY REQUIRE HIGHER LEVELS OF AFFORDABILITY. THIS WILL LEAD TO THE PRODUCTION OF THOUSANDS OF NEW INCOME RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOMES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHICH WAS ANOTHER CRITICAL REASON FOR OUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AS THE SENATE A SENATOR WIENER DESCRIBED SB FIFTY ALSO HELPS PRESERVE EXISTING AFFORDABILITY AND PROTECT TENANTS FROM DISPLACEMENT. THROUGH STRICT DEMOLITION PROVIDE CONTROLS ON SITES THAT HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED BY TENANTS WITHIN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. AND ANY SITE THAT HAS HAD AND ELLIS ACT EVICTION OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. SB FIFTY ALSO INCORPORATES. CRITICAL COMPONENT THAT IN PH PUSH FOR THROUGH THE CASA CON PROCESS CALLED. SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES CAUGHT SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES WHICH ALLOW LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO THE POWER TO SELF DETERMINE THEIR FUTURE BY THE LAYING THERE IN INCREASED AND CITIES IN SB FIFTY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. SO THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES CAN DEVELOP THEIR OWN COMMUNITY PLANS THAT ADDRESS ISSUES OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND ANTI DISPLACEMENT POLICIES WHILE STILL MEETING THE MINIMUM BILL HEIGHTS AND DENSITIES. WELL SB FIFTY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE WE AND THEN PH FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MORE THE MORE HOMES ACT IS ONE OF THE CRITICAL SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS OUR STATE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. WE'D I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND POSSIBLE [inaudible] FOR TWO NEXT WITNESS. MADAM CHAIRMAN MICHAEL GUNNING WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION FOR A START I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE MY GOOD FRIEND CITIES ARE HERE AND THAT WE'RE HERE TOGETHER -- AND HAVE YOU KNOW CBI A INSTITUTED THE HOUSING KILLER AND HOUSING CREATOR LIST LAST YEAR WHICH POINTS WHICH TRIES TO IDENTIFY THOSE -- THOSE BILLS THAT EITHER EXACERBATE OR MILLIE EIGHT THE HOUSING CRISIS AND WE'RE HERE TO ANNOUNCE THAT OF COURSE SB FIFTY IS A HOUSING. CREATOR TODAY AND I THINK ONE WAY TO POINT THAT IS LITERALLY TO GO THROUGH THE DEFINITIONS ON HOW WE ARRIVED AT THAT DECISION AND EXPLAIN WHY SB FIFTY MAKES THE CRITERIA. WELL THE BILL STIMULATE HOUSING PRODUCTION SUPPLY YES. WOULD DECREASE THE COST TO BUILD HOUSING YES WOULD MAKE HOUSING LESS EXPENSIVE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS YES WOULD MAKE ANY OF THE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH HOMEBUILDING SUCH AS THE EXT ENTITLEMENT APPROVAL OR PERMITTING PROCESS LESS COMPLICATED EASIER AN EXPEDITIOUS. YES WILL ENCOURAGE HOMEOWNERSHIP YES DOES IT DECREASE REGULATORY BARRIERS YES. DOES THE BILL PROPOSED TO RESOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS FAIRLY WITH AN EGALITARIAN DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOLUTION YES. SO. WITH THAT CRITERIA OUTLINED WE CERTAINLY THINK THIS IS A HOUSING CREATOR AND DESERVES OUR SUPPORT IN AN AYE VOTE TODAY AND URGE YOU TO VOTE ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SISTER THE IS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL.

FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PERSONALLY STRUGGLING WITH HOUSING -- AND SO I ALSO REPRESENT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ACTUALLY BUILD THE HOUSING AND MAKE A LIVING. OFF OF AND CAREERS -- WITH BENEFITS FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY CLOSE TO OUR HEARTS -- IN THE BUILDING TRADES TO WORK VERY CLOSELY AT ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT BOTHER STATUS FACE WITHOUT -- ONE OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF HOUSING OTHER HOUSING CRISIS IS A INCREASING EVER INCREASING INCOME GAP. AND PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO EARNED -- ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES -- WHICH WHERE THEY'RE WORKING. AND SO -- WITH THAT COMPLEXITY -- OFTENTIMES A SOLUTION TO TRY TO PRODUCE MORE HOUSING. HAS TO DEAL WITH ISSUES OF LOCAL CONTROL -- HOW TO DEAL WITH THE ENVIRONMENT? HOW TO DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICES SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SERVICES THAT IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING AND WORKING AROUND THOSE COMMUNITIES? AND OF COURSE AFFORDABILITY. BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE ECONOMY. AND SO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WE ARE VERY PROUD OF HOW -- THE CENTER HAS REACHED OUT TO A LARGE COALITION OF FOLKS AND IS STILL WORKING WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN VERY SURGICAL AND CAREFUL MANNER.

I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY OTHER SUPPORT AND TO ME AS WELL -- CITY GEORGIA BENEATH REPRESENTING AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION WERE ACTUALLY THE ONES ARE GONNA HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS -- AND WE WERE YOU TALK TO THE AUTHOR WE HAVE A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL ISSUES THEN WE'D LIKE TO BE FIXED SO IT FUNCTIONS WELL. AND THAT WORKS WELL WITH THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN PASSED -- WE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GONNA HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS AT THE CANNERY WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO THAT. IN ADDITION WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S MORE CONTEXT SPECIFIC SO WE DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THE GOALS OF THE BILL TO JUST WANT TO LET LET EVERYTHING ABOUT THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL -- FOLKS HERE IN SUPPORT. IF NOT THOSE OPPOSED TO YOU COME FORWARD THREE OF OKAY [inaudible] SIR. TO ALL THREE OF YOU WILL HAVE THREE SONS CHOOSE WHICH IS GOING. TO AND THEN -- AND TOTAL OF TEN MINUTES SOPHIA AS THE CHURCH THANK YOU. SURE MEMBERS CHASE FRIENDLY CALIFORNIA CITIES -- WE HAVE AN OPPOSING THE SUBMITTED POSITION ON THIS BILL. AND I THINK YOU KNOW THIS YEAR. KILLER HOME WE WE'VE REALLY -- YOU KNOW PUSH OURSELVES TO GET TO A POSITION WE CAN REMOVE YOUR OPPOSITION TO NUMBER THESE BILLS ON SWEET YOU KNOW TAKING A REALLY DEEP DIVE WITH OUR BORDER POLICY COMMITTEES ARE INTERNAL COMMITTEES AND COMMITTEES. TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT ARE THOSE SOLUTIONS MAYBE ALTERNATIVES -- BUT WHAT CAN WE DO IN ORDER FOR THIS DISCUSSION -- AND TO BE REALLY CLEAR THOUGH -- YOU KNOW WE WE AGREE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH HOMES BEING BUILT IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE KNOW THAT WE ARE CERTAINLY PART OF THAT SOLUTION AND WE PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT PART AND SAY IN THE STAGE FOR FOR DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY IN SUPPORT OF MORE DENSITY AROUND KEY TRANSIT AND JOB CENTERS NEAR WERE OR ABSOLUTELY AND SUPPORT OF OPENING UP YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITIES TO ALL THOSE FOLKS WHO WANT TO LIVE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES -- BUT I THINK THERE'S WAYS OF GOING ABOUT DOING IT PERHAPS THAT -- THAT MIGHT BE MORE ACCEPTABLE TO TO FOLKS. SO WHAT SPECIFICALLY REGARD SB FIFTY ON THE ISSUE -- THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW THE COURSE OF THIS IS REALLY THE UNDERMINING OF THIS EXISTING PLANTS AND WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT -- ILLEGALS OWNING AND NOT BE ABLE TO BUILD -- WHILE IT'S NOT A FORMALLY AUTHORIZED TO BUILD A MULTI FAMILY IN A SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOTHING PROHIBITS A BILL FROM COMING INTO MY QUESTION IS ONLY CHANGE IN ORDER TO BUILD THAT -- SO THAT OFTEN DOES HAPPEN AND THEN IT WILL OCCUR BUT IT DOES ALSO MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE DEVELOPER I'M TO ACTUALLY BUILD. NOW WITH REGARD TO THE PLANS IT WOULD JUST LIKE TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT 90% 91% OF OUR CITIES ALL HAVE AN APPROVED HOUSING PLAN THIS IS SOMETHING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS APPROVED. IT IS REQUIRED BY LAW JUST IKE A GENERAL PLAN. AND WE HAVE ALL OF THE ZONING AND CITED IN EDUCATION NECESSARY TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE GROWTH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAID WE MUST ACCOMMODATE INNER CITIES. SO THE STATE IS COMPLETELY COMPLICIT WHEN IT COMES TO APPROVING THOSE PLANS SO IT IS SAYING THAT WE ARE READY FOR DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPERS COME IN AND DEVELOP SO THE IDEA THAT. WE'RE JUST NOT DOING WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IF WE ARE FOLLOWING THE HOUSING PLAN THAT IS APPROVED BY SEE THE CALIFORNIA WE ABSOLUTELY ARE. SO BY COMING IN AND HAVING THIS TOP DOWN APPROACH AND COMPLETELY UNDERMINING THOSE PLANS A REALLY QUESTIONS WHY CITIES HAVE TO DO GENERAL PLAN AND WHY CITIES NEED TO DO A HOUSING ELEMENT. AND INCORPORATE ALL THE COMMUNITY INPUT IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE'RE SETTING OUR CITIES UP TO FAIL YOU TELLS THE PLAN YOU pARE GOING TO BE CHANGED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL INPUT. SO PROVIDING THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR INPUT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT SB FIFTY I'M STILL HAS THE DEVELOPER OFTEN APPROACH WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE CONCERNS WITH. BECAUSE IT'S NOT SITTING STATE POLICY THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THE DEVELOPERS GOING TO BUILD A MAXIMUM HEIGHT THE MAXIM DENSITY. IMPORTANT TRANSIT HUB THEY COULD FLUCTUATE BETWEEN THEIR SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT IF THE STATE WANTS TO HAVE A POLICY MAYBE SHE LITTLE PRESCRIPTIVE IN WHAT'S THAT HEIGHT WHAT'S THAT DENSITY THEY LIKE TO SEE. AND NOT ALLOW IT OVER TO TO PICK AND CHOOSE -- AND FINALLY YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO TO TO SAY THEY CERTAINLY APPRECIATE SENATOR WINNERS -- ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT COMMUNITIES ARE DIFFERENT AND THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME TO UPDATE THEIR PLANS -- WE JUST THINK THAT PERHAPS ALL COMMITTEE SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE THAT STILL MEETS THE STATE CRITERIA THE STATE CAN BE VERY SPECIFIC IN WHAT THEY WANT. BUT ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR US TO MEET THOSE NEEDS AND WITH THAT I'LL HAND IT OVER TO THE NEXT SPEAKER THANK YOU. I GUESS SON THANK YOU KAREN KLINGER LOCAL REAL ESTATE BROKER I OPPOSE SORRY IT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT BILL BUT WE ALREADY HAVE THAT IN OUR COUNTY GENERAL PLAN UPDATE AND MORE. THIS IS BY RIGHT ANYTHING THAT -- YOU'RE SAYING. YOU WANT TO HAVE BUILT LIKE IT'S NOW SEVEN STORIES NOT EIGHT BY THE POTENTIAL OF EIGHT STORIES THIS WOULD DESTROY MY SUBURBAN. SINGLE FAMILY ONE HOME PER LOT NEIGHBORHOOD [inaudible] BECAUSE IT IS MY RIGHT THE LOCAL OFFICIALS WOULD BE ELIMINATED UNDER THIS PROCESS YOU WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF AGENCIES AND DEFINITELY THIS IS ABOUT REGIONALIZATION WHICH AYE OPPOSED. I SUPPORT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR VISION AND WE THE PEOPLE OUR VISION OF WHAT WE WANT. I DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO SEE A VIOLATION OF OPS OWNING. AND IT CAN BE UP SOME DID IN THE TIME NOT JUST UNDER THIS ONCE UPS OWNED IT ANYTIME. THIS IS THE REMOVAL AS A SET OF A LOCAL -- LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING IN TO SEE THE FUNDING SOURCE ON THIS BECAUSE A CA ONE IS GOING TO BE THE FUNDING SOURCE -- BUT THIS IS THERE'S A LOT OF UNKNOWNS WITH THIS AND IT'S UNKNOWN BECAUSE WHEN THE ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE REMOVED WHO WILL BE OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. WE KNOW THAT IT WILL BE SPECIAL INTERESTS STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE PAST WE KNOW IT COULD BE OBVIOUSLY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. WE KNOW IT COULD ALSO BE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL ALL KINDS OF COMMITTEES DEPARTMENTS AGENCIES A PARTY'S. BETTER THERE BUT THEY'RE HIDDEN AROUND KNOWN YOU DON'T SEE THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE THERE IT'S LIKE REDEVELOPMENT THIS IS ABOUT REDEVELOPMENT THIS IS ABOUT DESTROYING. SUBURBAN ONE HOME PER LOT SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL NO NEIGHBORHOODS. AND I'M SORRY BUT I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS THIS IS DISCRIMINATION. IT'S ALSO ABOUT SMART GROWTH AND IF ANY OF YOU FOLLOWED SMART GROWTH YOU KNOW EXACTLY THAT IT IS ABOUT REMOVING ARE SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS ONE QUARTER TO ONE HALF A MILE. FROM THE TRANSIT TAUGHT STOP TRANSIT REMOVE SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS AND MOSTLY FOR THOSE IN POORER NEIGHBORHOODS TO HAVE ALREADY THOSE BUS STOPS PROBABLY MUCH CLOSER. I WANT -- TO FINISH BY SAYING THIS IS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM VICE TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENATOR WIENER MY NAME IS NORMA GARCIA I AM THE DIRECTOR POLICY ADVOCACY FOR THE MISSION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY WHICH IS A FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD NONPROFIT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. ORGANIZATION. HEADQUARTERED IN SAN FRANCISCO'S MISSION DISTRICT WERE ALSO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER WITH A SIGNIFICANT TRACK RECORD A FEW POINTS BECAUSE I WANT TO BE A ONE MINUTE TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN THE SAFETY VALVE OFFERED AS THE SENSITIVE COMMUNITY DEFINITION. UNBELIEVABLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE MISSION DISTRICT IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE AND A SENSE OF COMMUNITY WHEN WE SEE HEADLINES LIKE THIS ON SAN FRANCISCO WEEKLY THAT THE MISSION IS GENTRIFYING THERE'S NO DENYING THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO MISSION DISTRICT IS A SENSITIVE COMMUNITY GET WE DO NOT APPEAR. ON THAT MAP. THERE'S ALSO ISSUES AROUND ON THE SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES LIKE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SEVEN YEARS LET'S JUST SAY THAT'S US FIX STOP THAT WERE A SENSE OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SEVEN YEARS TO REVERT BACK. TO KNOW PROTECTIONS THAT'S NOT CLEAR THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE ABOUT A LACK OF VALUE WE CAPTURE FOR THE CITY WE'RE GIVING AWAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DEVELOPERS BY THIS PROPOSAL AND NOT BRINGING THAT MONEY BACK TO THE CITY. TO HELP WITH THE KINDS OF PROGRAMS A CONSERVE THE KINDS OF CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE IT AT META WHICH ARE LARGELY LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY IN SAN FRANCISCO IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THEY'VE CALLED THEIR HOME PERHAPS SINCE MANY CASES FOR GENERATIONS. THIS IS TALKING ABOUT REZONING THE WHOLE STATE. WITHOUT A STUDY. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WILL BE ARE WE READY TO PROCEED AS A STATE ON THIS SCALE WITHOUT HAVING BACK QUESTION THOSE IMPORTANT ISSUES ANSWERED. TEN PROTECTIONS THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK ABOUT THERE BEING SOME SAFETY NETS HERE FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN ELLIS ACTED -- FOUR HAVE LIVED THE WERE THE BUILDING HAS BEEN OCCUPIED IT FOR SEVEN YEARS. BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING HERE ABOUT WHATHAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO LEAVE THEIR PROMISES BECAUSE THEY WERE BOUGHT OUT TEN AND BUYOUTS ARE INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY FOR OF COMMON IN SAN FRANCISCO. THERE'S NO PROTECTIONS HERE THERE'S NO AND THERE'S NO ANYTHING HERE FOR TENET BUYOUTS. FINALLY THE LETTER THAT -- SENATOR WINNER ALLUDED TO THAT LETTER I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S VERY DETAILED AND IT AND EXPRESSES THE VIEWS. OF NOW FIFTY FIVE SIGNATORIES. COMPRISED OF LARGELY SOCIAL JUSTICE LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS. ADVOCATES FOR LOWINCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT SUBSTANTIVE CONCERNS. OUR POSITION AT MATTER WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED BUT WE ARE ASKING YOU TO TAKE A REALLY CLOSE LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS NOT PROTECTED. AND WE KNOW THAT WE ARE GROUND ZERO FOR GENTRIFICATION SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M FROM THE MISSION DISTRICT AND I ALSO HAVE DEEP ROOTS IN BOYLE HEIGHTS AND I CAN TELL YOU THE LAST THING I WANT TO SEE. IS THAT THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND SAN FRANCISCO IN BOYLE HEIGHTS IS REDUCED TO A PLAQUE ON THE GROUND THAT SAYS WE WERE HERE. SO IF YOU WANT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE TABLE AND HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS WERE HAPPY TO SPEAK WITH YOU SENATOR WIENER ABOUT OUR PERSPECTIVE WE'VE OFFERED TO BE THE TABLE WE CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT OFFER. THANK YOU HE GOT ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF LEFT SO I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT SHORT MY NAME IS RENEE KRISTIN MOORE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING IS A HUMAN RIGHT THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATIONS HOUSING ADVOCACY DIVISION I'M ALSO A VOLUNTEER TENANT ORGANIZER WITH ELLIE TENANTS UNION.

TO HOUSING IS HUMAN RIGHT HAS TAKEN AN EARLY POSITION OF OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL FIFTY WE BELIEVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THAT STRIP SIGNIFICANT POWERS FROM OUR COMMUNITIES TO DETERMINE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES LIKE PLEASE TO EXPERIENCE AGAIN IF I CAN GENTRIFICATION PRESSURES WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LIKE THE ONE I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN AND WHAT SHAPES MY UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM AT HAND. WE BELIEVE SB FIFTY WILL ADD SUBSTANTIAL PRESSURE TO TENANTS IN PLACES LIKE LA DOING LITTLE TO SPUR THE TYPE OF HOUSING CONSTRUCTION WE NEED WHILE PUTTING UPWARD PRESSURE ON RENTAL HOME PRICES IN HOT REAL ESTATE MARKETS. AS WRITTEN SB FIFTY WOULD NOT MANDATE SUFFICIENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL PROJECTS AND A SKILL COMMENSURATE TO THE CRISIS AND IN FACT MAKES EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSING REQUIREMENTS WHICH WE MOST URGENTLY LEADING CAP NEED IN CALIFORNIA OPTIONAL. THE BILL ALLOWS DEVELOPERS TO PAY THEIR WAY OUT OF FULFILLING ONSITE AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN LA. AS WE'VE SEEN A DEVELOPERS BEING INCENTIVIZE TO BUILD THE WRONG SORT OF HOUSING FOR THE COMMUNITIES I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ESPECIALLY IN SOUTH CENTRAL LA AND IN NORTHEAST LA THANK YOU BY THE WAY.

MAILING STEPHAN REPRESENTING SUNNYVALE NEIGHBORS WE WANT TO RISE AND RECESSED SB FIFTY WE WANT OUR COUNT SHOWS TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE. PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE OUR LOCAL DEMOCRACY THANK YOU [inaudible] QUE EL. THAT'S IT ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS -- SENATOR SKINNER YOUR ALL I THOUGHT YOU WENT THAT WAY THIS [inaudible] ROTH. ACTUALLY I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION HAPPEN WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL IN THE ONE TO FOLLOW BUT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME OF THE BILL. SENATOR I WILL. YES -- IS THAT A COUPLE QUESTIONS I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE. TO GET ALL THE ANSWERS RIGHT NOW BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE STOOD OUT. TO ME -- IS IF ONE OF THE GOALS IS TO INCREASE HOUSING. FOR ALL INCOME SNEER TRANSIT AND I KNOW YOU ARE. COMMITTED TO THAT WHY INCLUDE ON IN -- IN LIEU FREE OPTION. THAT ALLOWS AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO BE PLACED ELSE WERE AWAY FROM TRANSIT BUT HIT ME. I THANK YOU -- CENTER THERE ALSO FOR THAT. QUESTION -- THIS IS BEEN INTERESTING BONE OF CONTENTION. BECAUSE THAT PROVISION FOR THE IN THE MOVIE WAS PLACED IN THE BILL AT THE REQUEST OF NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS THE PEOPLE WHO BUILD A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE -- BECAUSE THOSE FEES GO TO FIND OUT A 100% FOR WHETHER IT'S FOR FORMALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE. FOR SENIORS OR WHATEVER THERE'S BEEN CONCERN ABOUT THAT AND WHAT I'VE ON THE EQUITY ADVOCATES ARE THE HOUSING ADVOCATES WHO RAISES CONCERNS. I'VE ENCOURAGE -- TO ENTER INTO DIALOGUE WITH THE NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS THIS IS A PROGRESSIVE. DISCUSSION AND AND I YOU KNOW WE CAN GO IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS ON THAT BUT I JUST WANNA FROM ABOUT TWICE. IT'S IN THE BILL OKAY IT WAS NOT OR IT WAS NOT MY ORIGINAL INTENTION. OKAY -- ANOTHER QUESTION IS. I THINK THIS IS BROUGHT UP BY ONE OF THE SPEAKERS IS -- WHERE GENTRIFICATION IS ALREADY UNDER WAY -- HOW DO WE IS OUR WAY OR HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES ALSO? INCLUDES THAT MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN THAT. SIR CAN YOU COULD YOU JUST YEAH. THIS IS ABOUT -- AREAS WERE GENTRIFICATION IS ALREADY UNDER WAY LIKE HOW DOES THE DEFINITION OF A SENSE OF COMMUNITY. INCLUDES THAT AND NOT SO MUCH JUST. YOU KNOW LEVELS OF POVERTY OR SEGREGATION BUT THERE'S ALSO ISSUES OF GENTRIFICATION THAT HAVE ALREADY STARTED. SORRY I WASN'T SPEAKING WORLD I MEAN ON THE SIDE -- SO -- CENTER THANK YOU FOR THAT THE THE THE SENSITIVE COMMUNITY DISCUSSION AS A CONTINUING -- ONE THERE'S BEEN -- WORK THAT IS HAPPEN ON THAT ISSUE BOTH AT A AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL -- AND ALSO IN THE BAY AREA -- AND WE PROVIDE SOME A LOT OF STUDENTS TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE IMPLEMENTATION -- AND THAT'LL BE A CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSION -- WE I WANT ONE THING I DO WANT TO KNOW I'M ONLY BECAUSE THE META FROM THE MISSION. WHAT'S YOUR TESTIFYING AGAINST THE THERE ARE LOW INCOME COMMUNITY THIS IS NOT ALL THERE AREAS LIKE ITSELF LA OR PARTS OF OAKLAND -- THAT ARE ZONED -- LOW DENSITY BUT WE KNOW THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- ARE OFTEN ZONE THAT HIGH DENSITY ALREADY BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN THE INEQUITABLE APPROACH WE TAKE IN THE HOUSING FOR A LONG TIME IN THE STATE OR WEALTHIER. PLACES HAVE LOW DENSITY SINGLE FAMILY HOME -- AND LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES CUTS ON FOR DENSITY -- THE MISSION -- IS ZONED FOR SIGNIFICANT DENSITY -- AND SO I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE AT RISK FOR BEING GENDER FIGHTER MAYBE GENTRIFIED. THAT WON'T HAVE MUCH IMPACT FROM THIS BILL BECAUSE ARE ALREADY ZONED. FOR DENSITY -- BUT THAT WILL BE A CONTINUING DISCUSSION -- SO LET ME JUST SAY HI -- WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS YOU AND I I KNOW YOU WORKED EXTREMELY HARD OVER THE LAST AT LEAST TWO YEARS IF NOT LONGER. UP MANY YEARS SEVERAL YEARS AN AND I APPRECIATE KNOW EVERY TIME THAT YOU GOT ANOTHER ORGANIZATION TO SUPPORT YOU GOT VERY EXCITED BECAUSE YOU'RE COALITION WAS GROWING. AND AS A COALITION BUILDER I TRULY BELIEVE IN THAT SO I COMMEND YOU FOR THAT NIGHT I THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK -- I REPRESENT A VERY DIFFERENT OF VERY DIVERSE PART OF LOS ANGELES -- AND CERTAINLY GENTRIFICATION IS VERY VERY HIGH ON THE LIST OF CONCERNS -- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VERY SIGNIFICANT ORGANIZATIONS -- IN LOS ANGELES THAT EVER REACHED OUT TO ME. AND THEY REPRESENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- AND THEIR THEIR WORK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN MY DISTRICT SO -- I'M NOT THE EXPERT I'M SURE YOU'RE BECOMING IF NOT ALREADY ON EXPERT -- BUT I RELY ON THEM VERY MUCH FOR THE KIND OF HOUSING POLICY THAT -- WE SHOULD HAVE IN LOS ANGELES -- I'M OPEN TO SUPPORTING -- THIS BILL BECAUSE I I KNOW YOU SAID SEVERAL TIMES THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO CONTINUE TO MEET WITH ORGANIZATIONS -- SO TO MOVE THROUGH THE FIRST STEP OF THE POLICY PROCESS SO THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. ALL RIGHT OBVIOUSLY I INTEND TO BE MORE INVOLVED WITH THE ORGANIZATION SO THAT I CAN BETTER -- EXPLAIN TO YOU -- FROM MY POINT OF VIEW AND THEIR POINT OF VIEW WHAT THE ISSUES ARE OF CONCERN -- SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY COMMITTED TO DO -- AND I HOPE THAT THEY'LL BE SOME INCLUSION OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REFLECTED IN THE BILL -- THE NEXT TIME BEFORE IT'S BEFORE IT'S A A COMES TO US -- I DO WANT TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SISTERS AND BROTHERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION. INDUSTRY IN THE CONSTRUCTION UNIONS BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE IN VERY GOOD JOBS THE ONLY WAY TO REBUILD OUR OUR MIDDLE CLASS. AND I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT -- FOR MORE APPRENTICES AND JOURNEYMEN AND WOMEN SO I APPRECIATE THEM ALSO BEING ON ON SUPPORT OF THE VIEW. I HOPE THIS DOESN'T BECOME OF OF US VERSUS THEM SITUATION BECAUSE WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES NEED EACH OTHER WE'RE NEVER GONNA. RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF HOUSING OR OF GOOD JOBS IF WERE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER SO. I'M RELYING ON YOU TAKE ALL THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND LET'S. CHANGE THIS OF OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION ENOUGH SO THAT OTHER CONCERNS ARE BROUGHT IN SO THANK YOU AGAIN CENTER. THANK CENTER MORLOCK BECAUSE CENTER. OTHER THAN THAT NO PRESSURE. CENTER WIENER -- IT'S AN AMBITIOUS BILL IN IT IT PROVIDES CHANGE. AND CHANGE CREATES A LEVEL OF ANXIETY SO I APPRECIATE THE GOOD DISCUSSION AND ALL THE HARD WORK TO BE DONE FOR THE LAST. FEW MONTHS THERE'S A LOT A LOT HERE-- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEFINITIONS AND SO YOU'VE GOT SOME GREAT NEW TERMS HIGH QUALITY BUS CORRIDOR JOBS RICH AREA HI I HIRE. A MAJOR TRANSIT STOP -- AND SO -- I WOULD APPRECIATE I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE IT TODAY BUT MAYBE IN IN THAT THE NEAR FUTURE IF YOU COULD DEVELOP A MAP. OF THE LEAST SAFE FOR ORANGE COUNTY WERE YOU YOU HAVE A TRAIN STOP HALF MILE. CIRCLE AROUND THAT IN. YOU KNOW THEN. YOU KNOW WHAT IS A YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE OTHER TRANSIT OPPORTUNITIES SOME OF THESE -- DRAWBRIDGE YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT WERE WERE READY JUST LIKE SAN FRANCISCO WE'RE WE'RE JUST BEHIND YOU AND DENSITY. SO ARM WOULD LOVE TO SEE WHAT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THIRTY FOUR CITY COUNCILS THEY ALL KINDA. YOU KNOW PERK UP AND IT WOULD BE NICE JUST TO SHOW AN OVERLAY OF OKAY HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. THE SECOND IS. THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA THAT'S AS BEFORE. SO DO I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN YOURS AND AS BEFORE OR DOES THE LAST WHEN THEY GET SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR PREVAIL OR WHAT WE WHAT WE DOING ON THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- AS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MY RECOMMENDATION IS FOR BOTH BILLS TO MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE -- SENATOR MCGUIRE AND I AS I NOTED IN MY OPENING REMARKS ARE WORKING INTENSIVELY TOGETHER TO TRY -- TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER AS OPPOSED TO HAVING COMPETING BILLS AND I KNOW. HE IS STUCK IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NOW I KNOW HE HAD WANTED TO MAKE SOME REMARKS I TO THAT HE'S JUST RELAY THAT TO ME WERE -- IN AGREEMENT -- THAT WE WANT BOTH BILLS -- TO MOVE OUT -- AND TO CONTINUE THAT -- THE CONVERSATION. BUT THEY ARE COMPETITIVE BILLS THEY'RE SIMILAR WITH THEIR SOME UNIQUE DIFFERENCES AND WE'RE GONNA. THE WHY AND OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO NOT HAVE COMPETITIVE BILLS. THE WRITING WORKING VERY HARD TOGETHER. TO COME TOGETHER AND MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER CENTER MCGUIRE AND I AND YEAH SO I I'M OUR GOAL IS FOR NOT FOR THAT NOT TO BE THE CASE NOW A LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION. SENATOR AND CONSIDER THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU SIR WIENER FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ISSUES I THINK FACING THE STATE -- SOME QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE AREAS OF FOCUS -- ONE OF YOURS A FOCUS UNDERSTAND IT'S QUARTER MILE [inaudible] OF RADIUS -- IN CONNECTION WITH A BUS STOP ON A FORGOTTEN THE TERM HIGH FREQUENCY HIGH FREQUENCY CORRIDOR. SO. IF IF THAT BUS STOP MOVE WHAT HAPPENS OF THAT BUS STOP MOVES TWO YEARS AFTER [inaudible] CONSTRUCTION BEGINS. BOB ONE OF THE REASONS -- UP FIRST OF ALL -- BY STOCKS FIVE YES IT'S POSSIBLE FOR A BUS STOP TO MOVE -- I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND SINCE WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN IT MIGHT BE A MOVES ACROSS THE STREET ONE BLOCK OVER -- SO IS IT POSSIBLE FOR BOTH OF THEM OF COURSE IT IS I DON'T THINK IT'S A COMMON. ONE OF THE READING WE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED THIS BILL IS SP TWO SEVEN LAST YEAR. BOB BUS STOPS TRIGGERED THE SAME HEIGHT CHANGES THAT FIXED RAIL THAT. OUGHT WE TO IN RESPONSE TO YOUR EXACT QUESTION WE CHANGE IT TO SAY THIS BILL WILL DEFER TO LOCAL HEIGHT LIMITS AROUND BOSSES. TO TRY TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE BUT IN THE END GOD SOMEONE BILLS SAY AN ITALIAN ABILITY THING AND THE BUS STOP MOVED. A FEW BLOCKS OVER IT THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD WE HAVE APARTMENT BUILDINGS ALL OVER. CALIFORNIA NOT ENOUGH PLACES SINCE MOST OF IT IS KNOWN TO MAN AT BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OUR BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE THOSE BANDS WENT INTO EFFECT -- SO I I DON'T SEE IT AS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. I THINK IN AREAS THAT ARE DEVELOP SERVICES GO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S LESS OF AN ISSUE THAN AREAS THAT ARE DEVELOPING -- WHERE? ROUTES CHANGE DENSITY CHANGES AND YOU CAN MOVE A BIT BUS STOPS. MAY MOVE A QUARTER OF A MILE OR HALF A MILE. SO THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH YOU. TRYING TO SEE IF WE CAN'T SOMEHOW -- MAKE SURE WE WE WE DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE. SORT OF A A BUS STOP EVERY QUARTER OF A MILE WHICH BASICALLY -- CHANGES. CHANGES THE THE WHOLE TENOR THAT BILLS WE WOULD WELCOME THAT DIALOGUE IN YOUR FEEDBACK ONE THING I WHY I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE CLEAR AND WITH THE SUPPLIES TO AT ASHOKE I SET HIGH FREQUENCY IT'S WITH A BIG LABEL AT HIGH QUALITY BOSS QUARTER. AND IT'S AROUND THE BUS STOP NOT AROUND AREAS IN BETWEEN THEM. ON AND IT HAS TO BE IT IS VERY ROBUST SERVICE SO IT HAS TO RUN FROM. SIX AM TO TEN PM MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY -- DURING THE RUSH HOUR PERIODS WHICH ARE AT LEAST THREE HOURS WITHIN THE SIX AM. TO TEN AM -- FOR THREE HOURS WITHIN THREE TO SEVEN PM IT HAS TO RUN A FIFTEEN MINUTE HEADWAYS. AND THEN FOR THE REST OF THE DAYS OF THE TIME PERIOD FROM SIX AM. TO TEN PM IT HAS TO RUN A TWENTY MINUTE HEADWAYS AND THEN ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY FROM EIGHT AM TO TEN PM THAT HAS TO RUN A THIRTY MINUTE HEADWAYS SO THIS IS. THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD POINT OUR BUS MAY NOT RUN THAT OFFICE ROBUST IT'S ROBUST SERVICE BUT WE WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION CENTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR SKINNER [inaudible] THANK YOU. I'M CENTER WIENER I WANT. TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INCREDIBLE WORK YOU'VE DONE OVER THE LAST. YEAR. I SAY YEAR BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AO I WAS SITTING IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE FIRST ATTEMPT WHICH I WASA CO AUTHOR OF SB. EIGHT TWO SEVEN I DID NOT MOVE FORT [inaudible] AND WHAT YOU DID SINCE THAT TIME. WAS TO REALLY. REACH OUT TO ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. THAT. HAD VARIOUS OPINIONS ABOUT. HOW A? INCREASE DENSITY AROUND TRANSIT. BILL MIGHT HELP US IN THIS HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN. NOW WHEN I THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE OUTREACH AND WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE AND THE COALITION YOU BUILT I AM NOT. I WANT TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT DISRESPECTING THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE OPPOSE. BUT I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BILL NOW. COMPARED TO LAST YEAR I WAS WILLING TO SUPPORT LAST YEAR'S BILL. THERE ARE. IT IS MORE LIMITED. THERE ARE FOUR FAR MORE. CAN I PROTECTIONS. AND THERE IT IMPACTS COMMUNITIES NEIGHBORHOODS SOME MAY SAY NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WHERE. SOMEBODY FOR NEIGHBORHOODS ALREADY HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY GENTRIFIED BUT THE WAY THIS IS STRUCTURED IS THAT. IT [inaudible] DOES NOT. ADD THIS INCREASE DENSITY IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT. WHERE THE GENTRIFICATION HASN'T COMPLETELY YOU KNOW IS NOT? YET A FETE ACCOMPLI. AND I REALLY RESPECT THAT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'VE DONE -- WE YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING. I THINK WE KNOW IT. WE'VE HEARD IT FROM THE GOVERNOR WE'VE HEARD IT FOR ANY ANY SET OF DATA POINTS THAT WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA IS IN A HOUSING CRISIS. NO CERTAINLY MANY OF US LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE LENS OF AFFORDABILITY. BUT WE HAVE TO ALSO LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE LENS OF SUPPLY AND WHILE. I AM NOT THE BIGGEST FAN OF UNFETTERED. MARKET CAPITALISM AND I'LL BE UP FRONT ABOUT THAT. THE FACT IS THAT. OUR THIRTY TO FORTY YEAR SUPPRESSION OF BUILDING HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. HAS COME BACK TO HARNESS. AND THAT. LACK OF SUPPLY THE FACT THAT IN YOU STAYED IN YOU AGAIN ANY DATA POINT ANYONE WANTS TO LOOK AT WE ARE. FORTY NINE IN NUMBER OF UNITS PER CAPITA [inaudible] FORTY NINE WE HAVE THIRTY THREE OF THE HIGHEST RENT CITIES IN THE ENTIRE U. S. OUT OF FIFTY TO PURCHASE A HOUSE COST TWO POINT FIVE TIMES MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY. THESE ARE FACTORS OF SCARCITY SCARCITY DRIVES UP PRICES. THE DRIVING DRIVING UP OF PRICES THEN DRIVES PEOPLE OUT. CREATES HOMELESSNESS. YES WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING YES WE HAVE TO HAVE INCLUSIONARY YES WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL THOSE THINGS BUT WE ARE STILL NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN SUPPLY. AND THIS IS A REASONABLE AND SMART INCREASE IN SUPPLY BECAUSE IT IS AROUND OR TRANSIT AREAS. AND I COMPLETELY SUPPORT DOES RESULT [inaudible] NOW. I APPRECIATE THOSE. FOLKS WHO'VE COME TO THE THE MIKE TO COME HERE AT THE HEARING BECAUSE THE VERY FEARFUL. THAT THEY COULD BE DISPLACED FROM THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. AND CERTAINLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WAY PRICES HAVE GONE UP IN ANY. OF OUR JOB RICH AREAS WERE ALL THE FREE TO THAT. I AM IN A YOU KNOW I'M ABOVE MIDDLE CLASS. BUT IF I WERE TO LOSE MY HOUSE TODAY I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO LIVE IN MY COMMUNITY OF BERKELEY. AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH RIGHT NOW IN BERKELEY THE BIGGEST CHANGE. IN THE LAST TWO SENTENCES. HAVE BEEN HAS BEEN THE AVERAGE INCOME OF BERKELEY RESIDENTS WHY. BECAUSE HOUSING IS SO EXPENSIVE KNOW WHAT A BERKELEY DO BERKELEY IN THE SEVENTIES PASSED THE NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION ORDINANCE WHICH BASICALLY PREVENTED BERKELEY FROM ALLOWING ANY APARTMENT BUILDINGS. TODAY THE VERY FEW APARTMENT BUILDINGS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME BUILT IN THE LAST. EIGHT YEARS BUT PRIOR TO THAT NONE WERE BUILT. OVER GOOD THIRTY YEAR PERIOD. TODAY THE ONLY LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT STILL REMAIN A BERKELEY ARE IN THOSE APARTMENT BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT PRE THE NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION ORDINANCE -- UNLESS YOU HAVE LIVED IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME THAT IS RENT CONTROLLED FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR MORE. YOU PRETTY MUCH CAN'T AFFORD ANYWHERE TO LIVE IN BERKELEY. UNLESS YOU AGAIN WERE ON SECTION EIGHT WHICH MOST RENT MOST OWNERS IN BERKELEY WON'T EVEN TAKE A SECTION EIGHT TENANT ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY CAN GET SO MUCH MORE. IN A MARKET RATE. AND I USE JUST MY CITY IS EXAMPLE BECAUSE I KNOW IT SO WELL BUT I COULD USE MANY MANY MANY MANY MANY OTHER CITIES. SO WE HAVE TO FIX IT AND THIS IS ONE WAY TO FIX IT AND I DON'T BLAME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALONE THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO BURKE TO CALIFORNIA. UNDER BUILDING THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS PRIVATE SECTOR WASN'T INVESTING IN URBAN AREAS FOR RESIDENTIAL PROP THIRTEEN DIDN'T MOTIVATE ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT THERE'S SO MANY FACTORS BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THE COLLECTIVE. INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OVER THIS ENTIRE PERIOD OF TIME AND ALL THOSE OTHER FACTORS YOU HAVE THE CRISIS WE HAVE TODAY AND WE HAVE TO FIX IT. AND I SUPPORT RENT CONTROL I SUPPORTED PROP. TEN I SUPPORT JUST BECAUSE EVICTION AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF THE FOLKS. THAT SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT ARE MORE IN THE BUILDING BUT YOU KNOW IN THAT SPHERE ARE NOT AS HAPPY WITH THOSE TYPES OF POLICIES THIS BILL DOESN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS THOSE. BUT WE HAVE TO DO BOTH WE HAVE TO PROTECT EXISTING TENANTS AND WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE FOR WERE NOT GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS CRISIS AND THIS BILL. IS. APPROPRIATE AND RIGHT ADDITIONALLY. WE HAVE SUPER COMMUTING CALIFORNIA NOW. SUPER COMMUTES BECAUSE THE VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT ARE YET HOMELESS. LIVE. EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED TWO MORE MILES AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS. BECAUSE THE THAT'S A HUNDRED MILES AWAY IS THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN AFFORD THAT IS WRONG. AND WE HAVE TO FIX THAT ALSO SO I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE -- AND IF THANK YOU. SENATOR BATES THANK YOU. LET ME ADD MY OUR KUDOS ON TO YOU SENATOR WINNER FOR TAKING ON A PROJECT LONG OVERDUE. CERTAINLY ARE LOTS OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE ON UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT COULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY ON MY BIGGEST ISSUE THE HAS BEEN AND I THINK OF SHARE THAT WITH YOU ALL ALONG IS THE PARKING. RESTRICTIONS THAT WILL BE LIFTED BECAUSE PARKING IN OUR SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES TO DRIVE SO MANY PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES I WANT. YOU KNOW GET INTO SO MANY OF THOSE TODAY BUT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DISCUSS AS WE GO FORWARD I JUST LIKE. TO I ASK A FEW QUESTIONS ARE -- BEGINNING WITH THE DEFINITION HI JOBS RICH AREA IT'S IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ANNOUNCES SENSITIVE COMMUNITY. AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT IS PRESENT IT IN IF IT'S RESPECTIVE LAWRENCE RETRO ACTIVE. AS WE GO FORWARD WHEN SOMEONE COMES TO A COMMUNITY AND WANTS TO DEVELOP -- A PROPERTY AND SEEKS THE DEFINITION TO ALLOW THEM TO GO FORWARD WHAT IS THE POINT IN TIME BECAUSE I THINK THESE ARE TWO AREAS THAT COULD -- BE GAME TO A LITTLE BIT DEPENDING ON ON THE APPLICATION PROCESS. HOW DO YOU SEE THESE SUPPLIED -- IN THE CURRENT WHEN THIS GOES INTO EFFECT IS IT TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN SOME COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE ALLOWED AN ADDITIONAL FIVE OR SIX YEARS TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN. WHICH COULD CHANGE THIS DRAMATICALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN COMMUNITY PLAN AND I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE MOST OF SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY. WAS DEVELOPED A LONG PLANNED COMMUNITY PLANS WHICH INCLUDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING LOW INCOME -- APARTMENTS WE HAVE A LOT OF APARTMENTS IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY SOME I THINK MANY COMMUNITIES ARE STILL WORKING ON THE RENO. THAT TIME NOT TO THEY'RE NOT UNDER GREATLY BECAUSE WE'VE HAD MAKES USE MUCH OF THAT SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT. INVOLVE OUR HOW WOULD YOU SEE THOSE SUPPLIED GOING FORWARD. SO IN TERMS OF THE JOB BRIDGE AREA. CATEGORY IN GENERAL -- THE BILL -- REQUIRES EACH CD AND TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN EVERY FIVE YEARS THEREAFTER TO PUBLISH -- THOSE MAPS SO IT WILL BE UPDATED. ON EVERY FIVE EVERY FIVE YEARS THROUGH EACH COMMUNITY. FIVE THE CITY WAS YOUR MAP FOR THE ENTIRE STATE -- THAT WAS CHAU WHAT QUALIFIES AS A JOB RICH OUR COMMUNITY. UNDER HEIR STANDARDS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING OUT FOR THAT YES AND THOSE ARE THE BILL CONTAINS ENUMERATION -- AND THEY'RE ALSO THERE ARE METHODOLOGIES THAT THE STATE HAS EMPLOYED. IN THE PAST AROUND -- THIS ISSUE SO THIS IS NOT -- RECREATING THE WHEEL FROM SCRATCH ALTHOUGH OF COURSE HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO CONFORM THE BILL BUT THEY'VE DONE THIS KIND OF WORK -- BEFORE SO IT'S NOT BRAND NEW IN IS NOT ARBITRARY FELT WHAT ARBITRARY IT IS DEFINITELY NOT ARBITRARY THEN SECOND ITEM IS UNDER THE CONCESSIONS THAT ARE GRANTED I THINK YOU SAID. THE SETBACKS WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED YEAH THE CONCESSIONS THAT ARE GRANTED THERE'S THREE ADDITIONAL ONES UNDER THE CURRENT DENSITY BONUS LAW IN ONE OF THOSE IS A REDUCTION AND SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING SET BACK AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND THAT WOULD BE GRANTED HAS AN ADDITIONAL CONCESSION ACCORDING TO USING THE EXISTING DENSITY BONUS LIE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. WELL THE THE DENSITY BONUSES EXISTING LAW YEAH HAS ITS PROVISIONS -- AND WE'RE NOT CHANGING. WHAT THE DENSITY BONUS -- PROVIDES BUT IT IS THAT IT WOULDN'T AFFECT SET BACKS AND THIS WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT COULD AFFECT. SET BACKS IF THEY ARE GRANTED ANOTHER CONCESSION UNDER SOMEONE INVOKES THE DENSITY BONUS BUT THEY CAN INVOKE DENSITY BONUS ON AFFECTS UP BOX TODAY. YEAH. SO THEN IT'S NOT. CONSISTENT THAT YOUR CURRENT BILL WOULD NOT A FAX SETBACK. REQUIREMENTS PUT ON OR SOMEHING BY A SB FIFTY ITSELF -- DOES NOT. OVERRIDE SAID THERE IS A NARROW CATEGORY OF IF THERE'S SOME COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE. WHAT WE MIGHT CALL ABUSIVE SETBACKS ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD ANYTHING RIGHT PUTTING THAT ASIDE -- SETBACKS ON OR NOT OVER WRITTEN IN THIS BILL BUT THE DENSITY BONUS EXISTING STATE DENSITY BONUS PROGRAM THE TIME IMPACT SETBACKS. AND WE'RE NOT CHANGING WHAT THE DENSITY BONUS -- PROVIDES OUR ALLOWANCE. BETTER SAID YOUR BILL DOESN'T ADD. TO WHAT'S CURRENTLY GIVEN AND LAW. IT DOESN'T GIVE ALL AROUND DENSITY AND IN SOME SITUATIONS HIGH AND IT DOES THAT ARE THERE THAT WE DO IN SOME RESPECTS. BUT PERCENT X. IT WOULD BE THE DENSITY BONUS SECOND IMPACTS UP BOX. I'M NOT YOUR BILL NOT IT'S BECAUSE THE BUT IF SOMEONE INVOKES THE DENSITY BONUS. BEN DATE BACK AND IMPACTS THAT BOX BUT THAT IS A LOT TODAY. OKAY THAT'S GOING A LITTLE CONFUSED ON THAT ONE FINALLY ON THE JOHN GENTRIFICATION. ISSUE ARE CERTAINLY AND ARE LOS ANGELES AREA SO I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH HAVING BEEN A FORMER ALSO. FORMER SOCIAL WORKER A LOT OF THE PROJECTS -- AND THE LOWER INCOME HOUSING AND SOME OF OUR SOUTH PHILLY AREAS DO LIE AND THE VERY ARE ALL. GREAT TRANSIT AREAS A JOB RICH AREAS BECAUSE ARE CLOSE TO YOU -- TRANSIT AND BUS SERVICE SO I THINK THAT THE ISSUES BROUGHT UP BY THOSE WHO ARE VERY CONCERNED ARE VERY REAL AND KNOWING THAT YOU'RE GOING. TO TAKE A DEEPER -- LOOK AT THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING AND SOMETIMES BECOMES ALMOST THE THE MOTIVATION -- FOR THOSE PROJECTS TO COME FORWARD SO. I'M JUST SAYING THAT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER CONCERN OF MINE -- HAVING WALKED THE BOX MANY YEARS AGO. THIS COULD DISPLACE LARGE POPULATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF THE SEVEN YEARS OR EVEN BEYOND. SO I'M CENTER MAY I I REALLY I I APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- TO TALK ABOUT GENTRIFICATION AND WHAT CAUSES GENTRIFICATION. I LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED THE CASTRO IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GENTRIFICATION ILIVE ABOUT FIVE BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE MISSION. WHICH HAS EXPERIENCED FOR THE LAST -- YOU KNOW GOING BACK AT LEAST FIFTY YEARS SIGNIFICANT -- GENTRIFICATION WITH THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ARE BEING PUSHED OUT. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT CAUSES GENTRIFICATION AND IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE BUT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS ARE CAUSES GENTRIFICATION DISPLACEMENT. IS NOT HAVING ENOUGH HOUSING. FIVE AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING IT EXPLODES HOUSING COSTS AND PEOPLE GET PUSHED OUT. WE HAD A HUGE FIGHT SAN FRANCISCO -- HEARD ABOUT THE MISSION BEFORE WE HAD A HUGE FIGHT ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO ABOUT AN EFFORT TO PUT A MORATORIUM ON HOUSING IN PLACE IN THE NATION -- BECAUSE OF A CONCERN THAT NEW DEVELOPMENT WAS UP CAUSING GENTRIFICATION PUSHING PEOPLE OUT. WHAT TURNS OUT THAT AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME AS OF AROUND TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR THE LAST DECADE OR SO THE MISSION HAD SEEN ONE OF THE LOWEST? NUMBER OF NEW HOUSING BEING ADDED IT WAS TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST AND SAN FRANCISCO IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF NEW UNITS OUT OF VERY LITTLE NEW. DEVELOPMENT HAD ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THE MISSION THERE WAS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE. VERY LITTLE HAD HAPPENED YET THAT MISSION WAS EXPERIENCING TERRIBLE DISPLACEMENT. AND GENTRIFICATION TO THIS NOTION THAT IT'S NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW HOUSING THAT IS CAUSING DISPLACEMENT -- WHILE OF COURSE WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IF YOU START ALLOWING PEOPLE TO START TEARING DOWN EVICTING PEOPLE IN TEARING DOWN BUILDINGS YES THAT IS DISPLACEMENT AND WE TRY TO PROTECT AGAINST SIDE. IN THIS BILL -- BUT WHAT THE HEART OF DISPLACEMENT IS EXPLOSIVE HOUSING COSTS BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING. FOR A GROWING STATE WE'RE PRETTY WE'RE ACTING LIKE WE'RE STILL A STATE OF TEN MILLION PEOPLE WHEN WE'RE STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE -- HEADING TOWARDS FIFTY MILLION -- AND SO -- THE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THINGS WE CAN DO IN ADDITION TO TENER PROTECTIONS TO REDUCE DISPLACEMENT IS TO ACTUALLY ALLOW ENOUGH HOUSING FOR EVERYONE THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE ON THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SEVEN AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR EFFORTS THANK AND ALTHOUGH THE ON GOING. AND MORLOCK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF SEVERE WINTER JUST WHEN I GET BACK TO IT. A LITTLE DIFFERENT TOPIC. BECAUSE YOUR YOUR WHOLE PREMISE IS BASED ON TRANSIT ANTI WANNA TALK ABOUT TRANSIT A LITTLE BIT -- I'M I COME FROM A SCHOOL WHERE YOU YOU KNOW THE TREND IS YOUR FRIEND. AND AND WE'RE SEEING TRANSIT DECLINE WE'RE SEEING LIKE A 40% AREAS. THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY SING BROKE BUS RIDERSHIP DECLINED. RATHER DRAMATICALLY UP TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S ALMOST. YOU KNOW YOU GOT IT CAN I DO A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS KIND OF STUDY ON WHETHER IT'S STILL. WORTH PURSUING SO PEOPLE ARE UING WHAT WITH THEIR UBER OR NEVER GOT. AN AGE OF SELF DRIVING CARS WHICH WE WOULD BE PERSONAL RAPID TRANSIT. SO THERE THERE'S LIKE A PUSH AWAY FROM. TRAINS AND BUSES WHEN A TRAIN FAILS EVERYBODY'S YOU KNOW STOCK AND THEY CAN. DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST STUCK. SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS. IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON ON THOSE CONCERNS IT IS IS THIS THE RIGHT PREMISE [inaudible] AND WHY. ABSOLUTELY -- I THINK WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE NEAR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION UNTIL LIVE NEAR WHERE WITH WITH NEAR WHERE THEY WORK -- AS A MATTER OF ENVIRONMENT AS A MATTER OF NOT FORCING PEOPLE TO COMMUTE TWO HOURS. AS IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HAVING -- HEALTHIER FAMILIES SO PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING HOME AT NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN THEIR KIDS ARE ALREADY IN BED BECAUSE THEY JUST HAD A TWO AND A HALF HOUR COMMUTE -- SO I I DO THINK THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. IS A VERY APPROPRIATE WAY OF DETERMINING WHERE YOU SHOULD HAVE A MORE HOUSING -- BECAUSE ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DRIVE YOU WANT TO GIVE THESE GIVE PEOPLE THE OPTION NOT TO DRIVE. ON NOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SOME OF THE DECLINING RATES OF TRANSIT USAGE THERE ARE AGAINST COMPLICATED THERE'S NO ONE REASON -- ONE OF THOSE REASONS -- WE SEE WE KNOW THE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IS IS GOING TO STRUGGLE IF YOU DON'T ALLOW DENSITY. AROUND THOSE TRANSIT PODS -- BECAUSE IF PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE NEAR WHERE THE TRANSIT AS THEIR VERY MUCH LESS LIKELY TO USE IT -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO LIVE NEAR TRANSIT -- LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE -- THE MOST LIKELY OUR WRITERS OF TRANSIT -- AND THAT'S TRUE IN A LOT OF AREAS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE ALSO AREAS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF YOU KNOW BOTH MIDDLE CLASS AND LOWER INCOME PEOPLE USING TRANSIT -- BUT IF YOU DO WHAT WE'VE DONE. IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS TO SAY IN A LARGE MAJORITY OF PLACES WERE ONLY GOING TO ALLOW SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. MAKES IT REALLY HARD FOR PEOPLE OF LOWER MEANS LOWER INCOME -- TO TO BE ABLE TO LIVE NEAR THAT TRANSIT AND SO IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO USE THAT THEY CAN'T WALK THERE. THEN YOU HAVE TO DRIVE TO TRANSIT WHICH IS VERY. CAN BE VERY HARD -- SO I I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOMMIT TO IMPROVING OUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION -- TO MAKE IT EASIER AND SAFER AND CLEANER FOR PEOPLE TO RIDE IT AND AND ADDING PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT AT LIVING CLOSE TO IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CURRENT I'VE WANTED TO MAKE SURE I ASK NO QUESTIONS UNTIL SENATOR MCGUIRE RIGHT THE FIFTY FIFTY ANIMAL FAR. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR VERY GRATEFUL -- I WANNA APOLOGIZE TO AT CARE WIENER. FOR BEING TARDY -- WE HAD A BILL. RIGHT BEFORE OUR BILL -- THAT ONE A LITTLE LONG AND OUT THEM THERE IS AS A ROBUST DISCUSSION -- BILLS I DO APOLOGIZE SIR. I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT AT SIMPLY TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR THE CONVERSATION. OVER THESE PAST MANY WEEKS SAID ASSN WINNER AND I HAVE HAD. IN THE COLLABORATION AS WELL -- SIR WINNER AND I'VE BEEN IN COLLABORATION FOR WELL OVER A MONTH NOW -- ON BOTH. SB FIFTY AS WELLS AS BEFORE. I I THINK IT WAS VERY STRATEGIC -- PRO TO MACINNES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. CENTER WIENER ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE -- IN BEING ABLE TO SIT ON HOUSING ENSURING THAT WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON BILLS THAT ARE MOVING THROUGH THE SENATE. AND THAT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THE BILLS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US TODAY WHETHER IT IS FIFTY FOUR OR FIVE IN. A CENTER WIENER AND I HAVE BOTH AGREED PRIOR TO THIS HEARING TO BE ABLE TO PLAY OFF OF EACH OTHER'S BILLS. NOT TO PREJUDICE ANY ISSUE -- AND COMMITTED TO KEEP WORKING AND WORKING TOGETHER INTO THE FUTURE -- AS WE BRING THESE DISCUSSIONS WE WOULD HOPE AND I WANT TO PUT WORDS INTO CENTER WINNERS MOUTH -- BRING DISCUSSIONS AND OUR COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS TO CLOSE BY APRIL TWENTY FOURTH WHICH IS THE DATE IN WHICH ALL THREE BILLS WILL BE HEADING GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE -- WITHOUT AND WITH GREAT RESPECT DO YOU WANT TO SAY THANK YOU -- AND KNOW THAT WE HAVE UP CONVERSATIONS OF THE COMPANY THEN VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE EFFORTS THAT YOU PUT IN YOUR TEAM IS PUT IN OVER THE PAST MANY WEEKS [inaudible] OKAY -- WE HAVE MOTION SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- THANK YOU -- MISTER VICE CHAIR. OUR COLLEAGUES THE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE DISCUSSION. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY -- FASTENING WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME AND HOUSING POLICY YOU CAN SEE FROM THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE THE VERY DIVERSE PUBLIC COMMENT TODAY SPANNING THE ENTIRE -- SPECTRUM -- AND AND JUST ALL OF A STAKEHOLDERS AND ALL OF THE STRONG OPINIONS TO THAT SPAN THE ENTIRE. RUN THE ENTIRE GAMUT ON IT'S IT'S NOT. SURPRISING THAT IT'S HARD. TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND HOUSING THE VERY VERY HARD THING I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT MIGHT BE HARDER IS LIKE TAX REFORM -- WHICH IS ALWAYS WINNERS AND LOSERS IN TAX REFORMS AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENS -- BUT THE BUT THE OTHER PIECE OF IT. IS THAT THE ONE THING THAT EVERYONE AGREES ON MAYBE NOT EVERYONE BUT I WOULD SAY A LARGE MAJORITY OF BOTH SIDES OF THIS BILL -- IS THAT WE WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING WERE IN TROUBLE. WE'RE IN A YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT IT'S A CRISIS IS AN EMERGENCY AS WE ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE -- AND BUT I'M AN OPTIMIST WE CAN TURN AROUND. AND WE CAN FIX IT. AND WE KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. AND THE THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN ARE NOT EASY. IMPROVING TARA PROTECTIONS IS NOT EASY WE KNOW WHAT HAVE YOU KNOW THE HISTORY IN THIS LEGISLATURE. ON THAT FRONT -- INCREASING FUNDING DRAMATICALLY. FOR SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS INCLUDING VERY LOW INCOME INCLUDING EXTREMELY LOW INCOME. THAT IS NOT EASY. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY AND THOSE CHOICES ARE HARD THE POLITICS ARE HARD. AND CHANGING THE WAY THAT WE'VE DONE ZONING IN CALIFORNIA FOR A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS. THE DYSFUNCTIONAL WAY THAT WE'VE DONE ZONING WHERE WE HAVE ALLOWED CITIES TO SAY NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO LIVE IN MY CITY. UNLESS YOU CAN AFFORD A SINGLE FAMILY HOME. IF YOU CAN AFFORD A SINGLE FAMILY HOME WHETHER IN THE OPPONENT BEVERLY HILLS OR IN SAN FRANCISCO ON WHICH IN THE LION'S SHARE OF SAN FRANCISCO OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN PALO ALTO. YOU CAN'T AFFORD A SINGLE FAMILY HOME [inaudible] GET OUT. THAT'S THE SIGNAL THAT WE ARE SENDING WE ARE TELLING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MOVE BACK TO THE TOWN OR CITY WHERE YOU GREW UP UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA LIVE. IN YOUR PARENT'S BASEMENT OR GET A JOB THAT PAYS THROUGH THE ROOF WE'RE TELLING. CHILDREN THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO LIVE IN A CAR BECAUSE ONE OUT OF TWENTY SCHOOL CHILDREN. IN CALIFORNIA IS HOMELESS. THIS IS. WE HAVE TO MOVE PAST THE PARALYSIS ON HOUSING AND CHANGE HOW WE DO THINGS SB FIFTY PEOPLE CAN HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT VIEWS I MAKE CLEAR WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO CAME UP -- INCLUDING OCTILLION CITY TO EXPRESS THEIR SERIOUS CONCERNS I KNOW THEY HAD A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME -- WHAT THEY DIDN'T MENTION IS THAT WE WORKED INTENSIVELY WITH THEM AND PUT AMENDMENTS INTO THE BILL AT THEIR REQUEST I HOTEL THE KNOWLEDGE THAT NEXT TIME -- BUT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK HARD AND WE WANT TO MAKE SOME POSITIVE CHANGE HERE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CENTER MCGUIRE AND OTHERS -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE SECRETARY. CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. SENATE BILL FIFTY BY SENATOR WINNER THE MOTION IS TO PASS A RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE SENATOR WIENER. WIENER I MORRELL. MORRELL AYE BATES NO BATES SNOW COVER. COVER I DORADO [inaudible] MCGUIRE [inaudible] MOORLACH. MORE LIKE I ROUGH. ROUGH I SINNER. SKINNER I UMBERG. CASKEY. SIX ONE WILL HOLD OVERLOAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALEX. SENATE. CHOIR YOU READY TO PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU. OKAY WILL NOW CALL -- ITEM NUMBER ONE AS THE FOUR BY SENATOR MCGUIRE WHO WILL BE CO PRESENTING WITH HIS JOINT AUTHORS SENATOR BILL OKAY [inaudible] NOT YET. I CENTER HOLDING ONE THAT'S WAY FOR PEOPLE TO THEIR ALSO OKAY I THINK WE CAN START SANDERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AGAIN I'M GONNA TAKE MOMENT. TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRMAN. FOR HIS COLLABORATION OVER THESE PAST MANY WEEKS. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THE GENTLEMAN TO MY RIGHT SENATOR BELL. WHO HAS BEEN A PARTNER IN BOTH SENATE BILL FOUR AND HE'S BEEN TAKING THE LEAD AND SENATE BILL FIVE AND WILL BE PRESENTING THAT BILL HERE IN JUST A MOMENT? AND IT'S GOING TO SAY PUBLICLY HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO BE ABLE TO TO WORK WITH YOU SENATOR BAIL AND FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK IN LEADERSHIP OVER THESE PAST MANY YEARS. ON THE AREA OF HOUSING. AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD. TO OUR CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS WITH GERMAN WIENER. LEADING INTO GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. MISTER CHAIR OVER THE PAST SIXTY EIGHT MIND CENTER BELL AND I HAVE PARTNERED IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA. IN FACT WE KEEP IT OFF LAST FALL. THE FIRST HEARING WE DISCUSSED THE HOUSING CRISIS AND HOW TO ADDRESS IT THROUGH FURTHER STATE FINANCIAL. INVESTMENTS OUR SECOND HEARING FOCUS ON LAND USE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO ENABLE ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE AND MARK RATE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. AND HERE'S WHAT WE NOW. WHAT WE KNOW IS AFTER THE SERIES OF MEETINGS AND NOW IT DIDN'T TAKE THE MEETINGS TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE THIS? BUT HEARING THE INPUT WAS IMPORTANT. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT? CALIFORNIANS FACED WITH A SERIES OF COMPLEX CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILD OUT OF HOUSING. WHETHER IT'S HIGH LAND PRICES. THE LACK OF HOUSING STOCK ASSOCIATED WITH GROWING DEMAND. THE LACK OF AN ONGOING SUSTAINABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING REVENUE SOURCE. REGULATORY HURDLES HI CASA SO SHE WOULD PERMITTING AND YES. SONY. AN INABILITY IN SOME JURISDICTIONS BUILD STRATEGIC INFILL HOUSING. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME TO BE ABLE TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT THAT'S FACING US. WE MUST HAVE A LASER FOCUS A LASER FOCUS ON THE BUILD OUT OF WORK FORCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL IN EVERY CORNER OF CALIFORNIA. AND HERE'S WHY. THE TRUE CRISIS EXISTS WITH THE WORKING POOR IN THE MIDDLE CLASS AT THE STATE. WE'RE SHORT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AFFORDABLE UNITS BETWEEN. TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN THE MODERATE. LOW IN VERY LOW AFFORDABLE CATEGORIES. THE STATE NEEDS TO STEP UP. AND WE NEED TO BE A TO DEVELOP A PERMANENT REVENUE SOURCE TO HELP SUBSIDIZE ACOSTA AFFORDABLE HOUSING CALIFORNIA. TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT WITH A BILL THAT CENTER BELLS TO WORKING SO HARD ON AND THAT'S SENATE BILL. FIVE WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS EVERY SITTING COUNTY THE GOLDEN STATE NEED TO DO THEIR PART WITH HOUSING. AND THE STRATEGY OF SAYING NO TO HOUSING. NO LONGER WORKS. AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE DIFFERENCES OF JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE A BLANKET ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK EITHER. AND THAT'S WHY WERE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH SENATE BILL. FOR SENATE BILL FOR ADVANCES. THOUGHTFUL STRATEGIES THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE. WITH THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT WE RECENTLY ADVANCED. THIS BILL HITS 90% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. BRIEFLY HERE THE GUTS OF THIS BEFORE. IN COMMUNITIES WITH FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATION IN A NUMBER ONE STRATEGIC INFILL HOUSING FOCUSED WITHIN A HALF MILE OF FIX PASSENGER RAIL OR FERRY TERMINALS. SHALL BE ONE STORY ADDITIONAL HEIGHT. ABOVE WHAT IS CURRENTLY ZONED. PLUS VINCENT DENSITY BONUS BY RIGHT AROUND RAIL AND FERRY STATIONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LIVE IN A COMMUNITY THAT ALLOWS FOR THREE STORIES. YOU AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVE A FOUR STORY [inaudible] BY RIGHT. AND THE MAXIM BUILD OUT ON THAT LOT. WITHIN A HALF MILE A PASSENGER RAIL INDOOR RAIL LINE OR FERRY TERMINAL. HOUSING IN THE COASTAL ZONE HISTORIC DISTRICT IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES WOULD BE EXCLUDED. BUT AGAIN THIS BILL HITS 90% OF THE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. BY RIGHT APPROVAL OF FOR PLEXUS WOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED. IN THESE BY RIGHT APPROVAL FOR PLEXUS WILL SPREAD OUT DEAN SITTING COMMUNITIES WITH A POPULATION OF FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE. BY RIGHT APPROVAL OF DUPLEXES TO SPREAD OUT INTO NEW COMMUNITIES WITH A POPULATION OF FIFTY THOUSAND OR LESS WOULD BE ALLOWED. WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF PARKING IN CITIES OVER? ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND NO PARKING WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF A PASSENGER RAIL OR FERRY TERMINAL. POINT FIVE PARKING SPOTS WITHIN A QUARTER MILE TO A HALF MILE CITIES UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND POINT FIVE PARKING SPOTS WITHIN A HALF MILE FROM PASSENGER RAIL. AS WELL AS PASSENGER FERRY. WE KNOW THE GREATEST NEED FOR HOUSING IS THE LOWEST IN THE ECONOMICS SPECTRUM. THAT'S WHY SB FOUR ALSO HAS A REQUIREMENT. INCLUDE STRONG LABOR PROTECTIONS ENSURE THAT WORKERS CAN LIVE IN THE HOUSING THAT THEY ACTUALLY BUILD. NOW ALL SAY. BUT THIS ISN'T AN EASY BILL. I AND CANDIDLY. WE HAVE HAD OUR SHARE. OF FOLKS WHO HAVE SAID THIS IS TOO AGGRESSIVE. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. EVERY COMMUNITY MUST SEE CHANGE. SB FOUR PROVIDES A PATH FORWARD FOR CATALYZING THAT CHANGE. WITHOUT EARNING OVER EVERY DIFFERENCE IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WOULD LIKE TO BE TO TURN IT OVER. TO SENATOR BAIL TO BE ABLE TO OFFER COMMENTS AS WELL. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I SUPPORT -- TO AND I'M PROUD TO CALL AFTER THIS BILL THIS THIS BILL -- PROVIDES -- IS SOONER MCGUIRE INDICATED -- CABLE THE RESULT OF THE HEARINGS THAT WERE CONDUCTED -- IN IN THE STATE LAST FALL AND PREPARING -- US FOR A APPROACH THAT GIVES FLEXIBILITY. TO THE CONCEPT OF INCREASING DENSITY IN A WAY HERE -- ALL CITIES CAN PARTICIPATE WHETHER -- OF SMALL MEDIUM OR LARGE SIZE COMMUNITIES -- IN TERMS OF MY EXPERIENCE IN. IN HOUSING AND REZONING AND OF THOSE KINDS ISSUE I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYBODY IN THE LEGISLATORS DONE MORE. APPROVAL OF HOUSING REZONING THIS THAT I HAVE IN MY THIRTY EIGHT YEARS. OF ELECTED PUBLIC SERVICE -- REPRESENTING THE CITY OF SAN JOSE ACTUALLY WAS ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS BEFORE I WAS ELECTED. SO I UNDERSTAND -- THE FACT THAT -- REZONING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS IS REALLY A DIFFICULT THING -- AND I THINK THAT -- THIS BILL PROVIDES WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE. A A APPROPRIATE -- AND DIRECT INCENTIVE. FOUR BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT CAN'T OVERCOME. THE INHERENT DISADVANTAGES -- TO GOVERNMENT'S MISS WILL GOVERNMENTS -- THAT BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING HOUSE OF THE DISADVANTAGES ARE WELL KNOWN WE HAVE A DISADVANTAGE OF IT IN TERMS OF TAX. REVENUES THAT'S A DISADVANTAGE. OF CITIES WOULD MORE LIKELY WANT TO BUILD HIGHER COST HOUSING OR OTHER LAND USES. THAN BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THE FACT OF MATTER IS THE PLANNING TO AS I SAID A LOT OF PEOPLE THE PLANNING DIRECTOR WORKS FOR THE CITY MANAGER. THE CITY MANAGER HAS TO PRESENT THE BUDGET. TO THE CITY COUNCIL THE CITY COUNCIL HAS TO APPROVE A BUDGET. WITH POLICE FIRE AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF SERVICES SO THERE'S AN INHERENT. WHAT I CONSIDER CONFLICT CONFLICT BETWEEN PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ON ONE HAND AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RUNNING AN OPERATED MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT. IN TERMS OF BALANCING THE BUDGET PREPARING A REVENUE AND ESTIMATES -- COLLECTING TAXES AND HIRING STAFF AND RUNNING THE CITY GOVERNMENT SO I THINK THIS BILL THIS BILL -- DOES PROVIDE A BALANCE. THIS NECESSARY IN COUNTER BALANCING THE INHERENT TENDENCY OF CITIES. TO SHY AWAY FROM BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY. IT'S A ZONING ONLY PROBLEM IS ALSO FISCAL PROBLEM BECAUSE CITIES. CITIES DO NOT. NECESSARILY. OF ESPECIALLY THE THE THE LEADERS OF THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT NECESSARILY -- CONSIDER -- THE PRIMARY DUTY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN MY OPINION AND I THINK SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES -- IT TAKES THE LEGISLATURE. AS WAS DISCUSSED IN THE LAST BILL AND WAS DISCUSSED IN THIS BILL. TO SET THE THE THE PRIMARY DUTY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. TO COUNTER BALANCE. THAT TENDENCY OF FISCAL MANAGEMENT AND CREATING THAT FISCAL TAXPAYER BASE -- WE WILL ATTEMPT TO DO THAT WITH OUR HOUSING BILLS. WE MUST DO THAT AND IT'S GOING TO BE A A NECESSITY IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. AND THANK YOU I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THE BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ABOUT RESPECT TO THE CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS WITH BASS FOLKS IN SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO STAND DOWN TWO DAYS WE KNOW THAT IS GONNA BE CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS AND WOULD I TURN IT BACK TO YOU SIR MISTER.

PEOPLE FROM THESE COMMUNITIES TO BUILD THESE PROJECTS THAT THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OR SHALL WE SAY BETWEEN HERS -- THE BILL I SING ON IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SIR PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON KIM STONE OF STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATED BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T SUPPORT THE PREMISE OF THE BILL BUT THERE IS A LABOR PROVISION IN THE BILL. THAT EXEMPTS FROM A CERTAIN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND ALSO PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS -- ANY CONTRACTOR WHO IS UNDER A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT AND SO THEREFORE IF OUR MEMBER CONTRACTORS -- FOR TO DO THE BUILDING THEY WOULD NOT BE EXEMPT FROM THESE REQUIREMENTS BUT IF UNION LABOR WAS TO DO THAT BUILDING THEY WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THOSE REQUIREMENTS -- WE FEEL THAT THIS DISADVANTAGES ARE MEMBERS IN AN UNFAIR WAY. AND THAT THEREFORE APPOINTED TO EXPRESS THOSE CONCERNS THANKS. I AGAIN BELIEVE THIS IS NOT A GOOD FOR SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS AGAIN I LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE OP E ARE ALREADY A TARGET FOR INFILL DEVELOPMENT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN ALL OF THIS IS VERY AND KNOWN IT'S VERY FRIGHTENING BECAUSE YOU COULD TAKE MY WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD. OF NINETEEN HUNDRED HOMES BY THIS ONE QUARTER MILE ONE HALF MILE AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M GONNA FIGHT YOU. BECAUSE I DO NOT BELIEVE THE STATE HAS THE RIGHT TO REMOVE NEIGHBORHOODS WHETHER POOR OR RICH FOR THE BENEFIT OF REPLACING IT WITH SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS DISCRIMINATION. GOOD AFTERNOON FROWNED ROSSI WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WERE. RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE LAST MINUTE TO THE VERSION AND PRINT HOWEVER IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE FORTHCOMING AMENDMENTS. TO REMOVE THE FEE IMPACTS SO WE LOOK.

OKAY SING THEM WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. COLLEAGUES AS A SARGON CENTER MCGUIRE. ONE I SHOULD WATER BECAUSE IN A MINUTE -- AS I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING -- SENATE MCGUIRE AND I SINCE WE'RE WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH AGREE THAT WE'RE GOING TO STAY OFF OF EACH OTHER'S -- BILL SO I WILL BE SAYING OFFER THIS BILL BUT I AM. RECOMMENDING THAT THE COMMITTEE -- SUPPORT MOVING THE BILL FORWARD IN AN EFFORT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION -- SO -- THAT IS MY OUR RECOMMENDATIONS -- ANY COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS QUESTIONS. SENATOR BATES A QUESTION REGARDING THE IN FILL ON DEVELOPMENT ISSUE IN COMMUNITIES WHERE YOU HAVE H. AWAY STANDARDS CCAR'S REGARDING THEN. THE TYPE OF HOME FIVE PARKING REQUIREMENTS WITH THIS BILL -- FOR PLANT A CC IN OURS AND IN IN A YOU KNOW. OWNERS ASSOCIATION. THIS WOULD NOT SUPPLANT ANY PRE EXISTING. BUT IF A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION WERE TO BE BUILT WITHIN FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT A HALF MILE OF THE RAIL LINE OR A PASSENGER FERRY TERMINAL. YES THEY WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY. DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE CITY HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE -- WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF RAIL LINE. NO PARKING -- REQUIREMENTS. WITHIN A HALF A QUARTER MILE HALF MILE. POINT FIVE IN ANYTHING UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND BE POINT FIVE PROJECT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT -- I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SENATOR MCGUIRE BECAUSE IN MY COMMUNITIES. ALONG THERE'S A RAIL LINE THAT RUNS. ALONG THE DECENT TO THE FREEWAY THE I FIVE WE HAVE SOME VERY ON HIGH AND DEVELOPMENTS THERE WHICH YOU'RE A GATED COMMUNITIES AND THERE ARE VACANT LOTS. LOT OF ARE INDEPENDENT YOU KNOW. FOR AN INDEPENDENT -- HOME BUILDER TO COMEY ON LOTS RANGE IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LOT. AND IF YOU COULD COME INTO ONE OF THOSE AREAS AND BUILD A TO TWO CLICKS ARE FOUR PLEX I THINK YOU'VE GOT INVERSE CONDEMNATION I I APOLOGIZE I THOUGHT YOU REFER TO THE LARGER DEVELOPMENT SO WITHIN THE DUPLEXER THE FOUR PLEX THEY HAVE TO BE A TO CONFORM WITH. WHAT THE LOCAL ORDINANCE ALREADY STATES I APOLOGIZE SENATOR BATES WHAT A CC IN OUR IS THE IS A A COMPANY? SO I I APOLOGIZE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO A LARGER DEVELOPMENT I AM SO SORRY SO WITHIN THE DUPLEX THE FOUR PLEX HE WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH WHAT THE CURRENT LOCAL ORDINANCES IN. THE LIGHT IT WOULD ALLOW BY RIGHT. IF YOU'RE LIVING IN A COMMUNITY FIFTY THOUSAND NOT A FOUR PLEX. I THINK THAT THAT IS PROBLEMATIC FOR THOSE HOMES THAT THE THEY BASICALLY WERE BUILT ON REGIONAL LINES ACTUALLY. HANDED OVER LOOK IN ON THE FREEWAY IN DIFFERENT AREAS BUT THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE -- BACON LOTS OPEN LOTS OF HAVEN'T SOLD PROBABLY MORE BECAUSE OF THE RECESSION. I TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THROUGH YOU KNOW JUST COMING OUT OF IT. ONLINE THAT WOULD BE VERY PROBLEMATIC AND SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO AVOID LITIGATION ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SECRET ISSUE. HAS TO DO WITH THE CHARACTER THE COMMUNITY IN THE CURRENT ESOS VALUES. OF THOSE COMMUNITY SO I JUST BRING THAT UP AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT. I THINK WHAT I'LL DO I I LIKE THE DIRECTION THIS IS GOING ON I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE SOME SECRET SAUCE YOU WORKING ON TO MAKE SOME MORE CONGRUENCY WHICH IS WHICH IS GREAT. SO I THINK I'LL JUST LAY OFF ON THIS BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S PROBLEMATIC CERTAINLY FOR THE AREAS THAT I REPRESENT WE HAVE A LOT OF COOL CELS ON SO THAT'S ALREADY OUT THAT THESE ARE AREAS THAT ARE BEYOND THE MEAN. HIGH TIDE LINE. AND THEY ARE NOT CURRENTLY DEVELOPED BECAUSE THEY WERE PROBABLY DEVELOPED WITH THE MAJOR -- HOUSING -- PLANNED COMMUNITY PLANS PROBABLY IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. I HAVE A DOWN UPON TO BE FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COLLEAGUES YES I WAS I POLITICS AND ARE MORE LIKELY DID HAVE FOR HIM BUT BEFORE SORT OF A YOU MISTER CHAIR. GOOD TO FEEL IGNORED -- THREE TO TALK TO IGNORE. OF SENATE MCGUIRE YOU YOU USE THE PHRASE IT THIS WOULD APPLY IN THE POPULATION THE CITY CALIFORNIA. I'M SORRY SAID AGAIN 90% OF THE POPULATION. OF THE STATE'S POPULATION 90% OR SO. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN BECAUSE? I DON'T HAVE ANY FERRY TERMINALS IN ORANGE COUNTY SO OF RAIL. I HAVE RAIL BUT IT'S A LOS HAND CORNER THEY CANNOT CUTS CUTS CROSS. DIAGONALLY IT'S NOT REALLY -- THE ARMY OF DESERT WE TALKED AND LAST QUESTION YOU HAVE TO DRIVE TO A TO GET TO IT FOR MOST THE RESIDENTS HOPE. SO I GUESS MAYBE 90% WHEN APPLIED ORANGE COUNTY THEN. I CAN'T TALK IF YOU SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ORANGE COUNTY BUT WHEN WE DID OUR MAPPING WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT BETWEEN RAIL FERRY TERMINAL. IS WELL AS THE FOUR PLAQUES. FIVE PLAY FOUR PLEX DUPLEX MINUS SEEN OUT [inaudible] HISTORIC. COASTAL IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. THAT'S ABOUT 90% OF THE POPULATION AND YOU HAVE A MAP. WE DID MAPPING YES AND BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MEDIC. PLEASE EACH RECEIVING JUST ORANGE COUNTY WOULD BE GREAT WONDERFUL THE SECOND QUESTION. IS THAT -- IT GETS BACK TO LOCAL CONTROL AND IT'S FROM CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE ELEVEN SECTION SEVEN THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING WELL WAIT A SECOND YOU CAN'T DO THIS IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL I'M WONDERING. IF EITHER OF YOU HAVE DONE ANY LEGAL RESEARCH. TO GET SOME SCHOLARSHIP ON ON THE ON THE CONCERN OF BABY. OVER WRITING WHAT CAN BE DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL [inaudible] SO [inaudible] WITHIN. OUR BILL THERE'S ALREADY PRESIDENT AT THIS LEGISLATURE'S ESTABLISHED -- IT SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW WITH AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE WITH THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT [inaudible] PLUS. ONE N. MAXIMUM DENSITY BUILD OUT ON THE LOT -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SB FOUR CAN'T SPEAK TO SB FIFTY BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT. CHAIRMAN SAY THE SAME THING WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD WITHSTAND ANY CONSTITUTIONAL TEST ARE IN THE COURTS. AS IT IS BUILDING ON PRE EXISTING. ZONE LAND. FOR HOUSING -- AND BUT DENSITY BONUS. IF ALLOWED BY THE COUNCIL WOULD ALLOW FOR AN ADDITIONAL STORY ALREADY. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR OKAY ANY OTHER DRIVE CENTER CABALLERO. I I HAD THE SAME QUESTION THAT CENTER MORE LIKE IT IF YOU COULD SHOW US A MAP THAT BE GREAT ABSOLUTELY AS I THINK WE HAVE IN OUR HEAD WHAT. WOULD IT WOULD COVER BUT IT IT'S BETTER TO SEE IT ON PAPER WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MAKING. OKAY YES CENTER BATES I THINK YOUR PARDON I MEANT TO AS GO A LITTLE DEEPER ON THE PARKING ISSUE I'VE REYES SO WITH SB FIFTY THE SAME ONE HERE BUT EVEN IF PEOPLE ARE LOCATED. CLOSE TO TRANSIT RAIL BUS SERVICE ODDLY STILL MOST LIKELY ON CARS AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHAT OF THOSE CARS GO IF WE'VE ELIMINATED. YOU KNOW PARKING REQUIREMENTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE OR EVEN JUST A HALF OF SPACE. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THOSE FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORS OF NEAR -- THE DEVELOPMENT AND WE'VE HAD PROBABLY MOST OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE CITIES THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH AND SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY. THURMOND FIGHTS OR PARKING ISSUES NOT REGARDING NEW DEVELOPMENT REGARDING -- DEVELOPMENT WHERE A MULTI FAMILY THOSE CLOSE TO THOSE SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE CHANGE THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS SO THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING. GARAGE SO THEY MOVE INTO THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ALSO GETS PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT WITHOUT PARKING. ARE THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS DON'T WORK SO. ARE I THINK YOU NEED TO TAKE A LOOK SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE PARKING RESTRICTIONS. THAT YOU'RE ALLOWING ON THESE ARE NO PARKING REQUIREMENTS AT ALL. ARE THERE HAVE TO BE INCENTIVES GIVEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE THAT EITHER SHUTTLE SERVICES YOU CAN WORK WITH THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES WITH THIS BE ONE AND THE MONEY THAT'S PROVIDED THEREFORE ON MORE TRANSIT. YOU CAN HAVE THOSE LOCAL CIRCULATORS THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING -- THAT COULD PROVIDE FIRM IS SHELTERING OF SOMEONE WHO OWNS A CAR OR YOU WOULD BE REQUIRED IF YOU MOVE INTO THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS THAT YOU BASICALLY. FIND A DOCUMENT THAT YOU DON'T OWN A CAR BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IS THAT. THERE WOULD BE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES THAT ARE CREATED WHEN YOU HAVE THESE -- RESIDENTIAL AREAS WITH TOM PARKING ALL ALONG NEXT TO THE SIDEWALKS WE HAVE HAD TWO INCIDENCES IN MY COMMUNITIES WHERE CHILDREN NOW CROSSING BETWEEN CARS AFTER THEY GET OFF THE BUS OR GOING TO SCHOOL. HAVE BEEN KILLED AND THAT'S JUST A FACT SO IT'S SIGNIFICANT WITH ME IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THIS THAT THERE'S A WAY. THERE'S GOT TO BE AN INCENTIVE IN THERE SOMEWHERE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THE OWNERSHIP OF A CAR EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T USE IT EXCEPT. FOR LET'S SAY ON RIGHT AROUND YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT AROUND COMMUNITY SHOPPING FOR THE WEEKEND ISSUES WHERE YOU'RE AYE TRANSPORTING CHILDREN NOT TO ALL THEIR ACTIVITIES. SO PLEASE TAKE A LONGER LOOK AT THAT AND BOTH OF BILLS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST HURDLE FOR ME HAVING I EXPERIENCE IT. FOR MY THIRTEEN YEARS ON A CITY COUNCIL IN MY FOUR YEARS ON THE BOARDS TO EIGHT YEARS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ALWAYS THE ISSUE. IS ABOUT PARKING THAT THAT GETS PUSHED INTO RESIDENTIAL AREAS BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF ADJACENT MULTI FAMILY. NO AND I APPRECIATED. THE THOUGHT THAT CENTER BATES IS PUT INTO THE SINCE COMING FROM EXPERIENCE. THROUGH THE CHAIR IF IT'S ALRIGHT. WE HAVE. TRIED TO FOCUS THE ISSUE OF PARKING. TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LARGER. A JOB CENTER. AND DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO RAIL OR FERRY SERVICE. SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE ONLY AREA WITHIN A BILL WITHIN THE BILL [inaudible] THAT. WOULD NOT ALLOW FOR PARKING AT THIS MOMENT. WOULD BE WITHIN A COMMUNITY OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND A QUARTER MILE UP TO A QUARTER MILE AWAY FROM A RAIL LINE OR FERRY TERMINAL. ANYTHING FROM A QUARTER MILE TO A HALF. WOULD BE POINT. FIVE POINT FIVE IS FAIRLY STANDARD -- ESPECIALLY FOR NEWER. I HIGHER DENSITY APARTMENTS CONDOMINIUMS -- DEPENDING ON COMMUNITY WHICH YOU LIVE IN. IF YOU'RE LIVING IN A COMMUNITY UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND BECAUSE TRANSIT IS NOT AS RELIABLE CANDIDLY. IT WOULD ALLOW FOUR POINT FIVE PARKING SPOTS -- SO WE WE REALLY TRYING TO REFINE IT BUT I HAVE. TO FOLLOW UPS. AS BATES SAID I HAD ONE IS THE FOUR PLEX DUPLEX ISSUE THAT YOU RAISE IN THE OTHER ISSUE IS PARKING. AND I PROMISE I'LL GET BACK. TO BOTH OF US WILL. SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU MISTER PERHAPS I MISSED THE SINCE I HAD.

FOR YES SO NEXT WE'RE GONNA BE GOING TO ITEM THREE WHICH IS SENATE BILL -- FIVE WITH OUR SAME JOINT AUTHORS BUT THIS TIME I BELIEVE CENTER BELT -- WILL BE TAKING THE LEAD -- AND THE COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. CENTER ABOUT. OF THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I PRESIDING SB FIVE AND ALSO JOINING ME IS OR JOINT AUTHORS AND REQUIRE. AND WE'RE PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY -- SB FIVE IS -- SUPPORTED BY OVER. SIXTY ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE BIG MAYOR'S STAKE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES FIRST COMMUNITY HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AND WE WOULD LIKE -- TO DISTRIBUTED A UPDATED SUPPORT LIST -- OF THE SUPPORTERS. OF SB. FIVE AND MANY OF THESE GROUPS WERE NOT IN YOUR YOUR REPORT. SO THEREFORE I WON A MAIL MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LIST. OF THE PROPER LISTS THIS BILL IS A A PART OF THE WORK THAT CENTER MCGUIRE -- DONE AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED -- IN TERMS OF SB FOUR FIVE AND SIX WHICH I BELIEVE IS COMING UP. AND A WEEK OR TWO THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE. THE PACKAGES BASED ON INPUT GATHERED AT THE SERIES OF PUBLIC MEETINGS. AND HEARINGS WE CONVEYANCE ACROSS THE STATE THIS FALL -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE SAY FOR THE RECORD THAT WE ACCEPT -- COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS -- CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS IS STAGGERING SB FIVE CREATES -- DESPERATELY NEED HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS. BUT ALSO HELP ALLEVIATE POVERTY CREATES JOBS AND MEETS OUR STATEWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS WITHOUT AFFECTING SCHOOL FUNDING. SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES CALIFORNIA'S HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE THE ESTIMATED A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND NECESSARY HOUSING UNITS PER PER YEAR -- THIS RESULT HAS HAS HAS CAUSED NEARLY IN MY OPINION HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND MEN WOMEN CHILDREN LIVING ON OUR STREETS EVERY YEAR. SO I THINK OUR HOUSING SHORES HAS ACTUALLY. CREATED THAT SITUATION. ANOTHER TWO POINT TWO MILLION EXTREMELY LOW INCOME AND VERY LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS ARE COMPETING FOR ONLY SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. THIS LEAVES ONE POINT FIVE FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS OF THE LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO HOUSING AND AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. THE STATE MUCH ACT WITH AN URGENCY TO ADDRESS THIS SHORTAGE. SB FIVE MAKES THE STATE A LONG TERM PARTNER. AND PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED MONEY TO SPUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION ACROSS THE STATE. IT PROVIDES SIX NEVER FORGET ONGOING INVESTMENT WRAPPING UP TO TWO BILLION ANNUALLY OVER TIME. AND OFFERS AN EFFECTIVE FINANCE TOOL LOST WHEN THE STATE DISSOLVED OR REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. SPECIFICALLY SB FIVE ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COLLABORATE IN STATE APPROVED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHICH WILL BE FUNDED BY REDUCING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE EDUCATION. REVENUE AUGMENTATION FUNDS. FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR THE FOLLOWING PURPOSES AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. WHICH COULD BE HOUSING INFILL DEVELOPMENT WHICH COULD BE HOUSING. RES REVITALIZING AND RESTORING NEIGHBORHOODS. AND ALSO PLANNING -- FOR THE SEA LEVEL RISE ISSUES. A MINIMUM 50% OF THE FUNDS MUST BE USE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THERE IS THERE IS A 12% SET ASIDE FOR RURAL CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND THE BILL CREATES A STATE COMMITTEE HOUSE UNDER THE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW AND APPROVE PROPOSED PLANS PROVIDING STATE. STRONG STATE OVERSIGHT. NOT NOT LIKE WHAT WE DID WITH REDEVELOPMENT WHERE THERE WAS LITERALLY NO STATE OVERSIGHT -- THE COMMITTEE HAS -- IS ALSO THIS COMMITTEE THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE IS ALSO EMPOWERED TO TAKE CORRECTIVE. ACTION WHEN LOCALS DO NOT MEET THEIR PLAN PLANS -- OBJECTIVES -- I LIKE TO TURN OVER TO SAM REQUIRE AND THEN -- HERE ARE WITNESSES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. CENTRE BELL ALL BE VERY QUICK. AS WE JUST HEARD THIS IS A DESPERATELY NEEDED MEASURE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT CRISIS OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FORMAL UNITS NEEDED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT'S THE DEFICIT WE PROJECT BETWEEN. TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN ADDITION TO THE 50% OF THE PROGRAM FUNDING GOING TO CONSTRUCTION AFFORDABLE HOUSING REMAINING FUNDS CAN BE USED RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE. BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN FROM DEVELOPERS AS WELL AS CITIES THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS WATER SEWER ELECTRICAL HOOKUP OR SOME OF HE LARGEST DRIVERS. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION COSTS. AND WE LEARN FROM THE LESSONS OF THE PAST CENTRE BELL HAS BEEN ADAMANT TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE. AND BRINGING FORWARD THIS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. THE BILL ALSO HOLES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE THEY DO NOT SPEND THESE FUNDS AS THEY SAID THEY WOULD -- SB FIVE PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH AN ONGOING REVENUE SOURCE TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT IT DOES SO IN THAT RESPONSIBLE WAY THAN INSURERS THE STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRIORITIES ARE MET. I AND WE WOULD SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR AND I ABOUT MISSED HERE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND AGAIN THANK YOU CENTER. THEN I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER THE WEIRDNESS JASON RYAN IS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CITIES AND DâN DOWNTOWN MUSHI FROM THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CARPENTERS. REGIONAL COUNCIL AND DANCE GOING TO PRESENT THE RESULTS FROM A ECONOMIC ANALYSIS. OF IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP THAT WAS DONE ON SB FIVE SOLTERO TO WITNESSES AND YES THANK YOU SIR ABOUT THE MEASURE MEMBERS JASON RHYNE LEE CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE LAST TIME MSM SO WE'RE BUT WE ARE IN SUPPORT VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. SB FIVE IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT IT BUILDS OFF OF ALL OF THE GREAT EXISTING TOOLS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED WITH PAST FIVE SEVEN YEARS -- WHAT'S REALLY BEEN MISSING THOUGH. IS THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE CITY COULD FORMA DE I FTA COULD FORMER CREA -- BUT THEY HAD TO DO IT ALONE AND THEY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE THAT FINANCIAL LIFT. SB FIVE IS A GAME CHANGER IN THAT IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE STATE TO ENTER THE SPACE -- THROUGH A AN APPROVAL PROCESS THROUGH IT OVERSIGHT PROCESS A COMMITTEE PROCESS I'M DEBT REALLY CHANGES ON THE WITH WHAT WE DID IN THE PAST IN THE NEW PARADIGM HERE IS. NOBODY IS FORCED AND CITIES ARE ENFORCED AND COUNTY SPECIAL JUST CANNABIS FORCED IN THE STATE'S NOT FORCED AND WE CAN ALL COME TOGETHER AND FORM THAT PARTNERSHIP AND THEN THE STATE CAN COME IN A AND DECIDE WHICH PROJECTS THEY WANT TO APPROVE -- AFTER WE GO THROUGH THAT LINK THE EDIFICATION PROCESS AND THEN IT'LL BE AN ONGOING FORM OF FUNDING THAT CITIES WILL BE ABLE TO USE IN ORDER TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A HOUSING. AND REVITALIZE OUR COMMITTEES -- IN WITH THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE TURN OVER THE NEXT GUEST. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS -- DANKO MUCCI I'M A RESEARCHER WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CARPENTERS REGIONAL COUNCIL -- AT CENTRE BELL NOTED IN COLLABORATION WITH CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. WE USE IT IN PLAN INPUT OUTPUT MODEL TO EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF DIRECT INVESTMENTS AND ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE FUNDS FROM SENATE BILL FIVE AS IT WAS INTRODUCED. OUR MODEL IS BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. AND LIKE THE PROGRAM WE EXPECT THE STATE'S DIRECT INVESTMENT FROM SB FIVE TO BE LEVERAGE OVER THREE TIMES FROM LOW INCME TAX CREDITS. OTHER FEDERAL FUNDS LOCAL FUNDS AND OTHER PRIVATE SOURCES. THESE INVESTMENTS COULD TRANSLATE INTO OVER SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY NINE ARE NOW ALSO IS ALSO SET ALSO SHOWS THAT OVER THE NEXT DECADE THESE INVESTMENTS CAN PRODUCE OVER EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND NEW AND REHABILITATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX REVENUE. TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN LABOR INCOME AND SUPPORT APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND JOBS INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND FAMILY SUPPORTING PREVAILING WAGE CONSTRUCTION JOBS WITH HEALTH AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS. THANKS TO EXISTING PUBLIC WORKS APPRENTICESHIP REQUIREMENTS PROJECTS THAT RECEIVE INVESTMENT SOME SB FIVE WILL SUPPORT WORKFORCE TRAINING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR VETERANS AND FOR OTHERS JUST BEGINNING THEIR CONSTRUCTION CAREERS. APPRENTICESHIP IS BOTH AN ESCALATOR TO THE MIDDLE CLASS AND IT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE HAS A SKILLED CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE WE NEED. TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING SHORTAGES. SB FIVE WILL NOT ONLY HELP US MEET THE STATE'S URGENT NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. IT'S AFFECTS WILL RIPPLE THROUGHOUT OUR ECONOMY. IT WILL RESULT IN MORE JOBS INCREASED CONSUMER SPENDING AND MORE TAX REVENUE IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN THE STATE'S CURRENT AND FUTURE WORK FORCE. AND THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CARPENTERS ARE PLEASED TO OFFER OUR SUPPORT THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OF TESTIMONY.

SENATORS PAT ACKLAND WITH THE CITY OF NEVADO THE CITY DID SEND YOU A LETTER INDICATING THAT WE SUPPORT SB. FIVE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OF THE TESTIMONY. HI THREE NINE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I'M I AM VERY APOLOGETIC WE DO HAVE A LATE OP THE OPPOSE POSITION ON THE MEASURE OUR STATE COUNCIL JUST TOOK A POSITION ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE PHYSICIAN BUT I DO NEED TO NOTE THAT THE WHAT THE AUTHORS HAVE BEEN DILIGENTLY TRYING TO WORK WITH US TO COLLABORATE AND WORK OUT CONCERNS AND WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE. OF SOME OF THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT HVE BEEN PUT INTO THE MEASURE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOL FUNDING IS PROTECTED THE PROBLEM THAT CTA HAS WITH THE METHODOLOGY THAT'S BEING USES THE ONLY WAY THAT SCHOOLS CAN BE PROTECTED IN THE EVENT. OF ANOTHER RECESSION IN A DOWNTURN IS THAT WE HAVE TO RELY ON FUTURE LEGISLATORS AGREEING TO BACK FILL UP PROPERTY TAXES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE LAST RECESSION THAT WE HAD PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WAS SUSPENDED TWICE. I'M SO IF WE COUNT ON THE PROMISE OF A FUTURE LEGISLATURE NOT TO SUSPEND PROP NINETY EIGHT AND TWO GUARANTEED THAT PROPERTY TAX REVENUE IS GOING TO BE BACK FILLED FOR SCHOOLS. WE WOULD BE PUT IN A GREAT SITUATION BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES -- FOR SCHOOLS AND SO SHOULD THERE BE AN ABSOLUTE GUARANTEE WE WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RELY ON ABSOLUTE PROMISES -- IN THE BACK FROM FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S AND SO THAT IS THE REASON THAT WE OPPOSE WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY WAY THE SITUATION CAN BE RESOLVED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN HELP OUR CONCERNS ADDRESS IS IF WE WEREN'T. IF THE BILL WERE USING PROPERTY TAX REVENUES FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THANK YOU NEXT RECORD. I THIRD I JUST HEARD A FEW WORDS THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR SO YOU ARE RESURRECTING IN A WAY STATEWIDE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES THAT ENDED UP WITH A DEBT OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND WE THE PEOPLE WERE LIED TO ALL THE TIME. ON'T TAX INCREMENT FINANCING FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS. IT'S ABOUT STEALING PROPERTY TAXES. AND GIVING THEM TO ANOTHER AGENCY. THAT MEANS OUR POLICE FIRE. ALL SPECIAL DISTRICTS DO NOT GET MONEY PARKS LIBRARIES I OPPOSE THAT NOT EVEN READING THE BILL BECAUSE I KNOW HOW CORRUPT. STATEWIDE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE AND IT WAS ALL ABOUT STEALING TAKING PROPERTY BY EMINENT DOMAIN WHICH EACH ONE OF THESE BILLS BY THE WAY. ARE REQUIRING IT'S ABOUT DEMOLITION I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS AND I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER WHAT KIND OF A GOVERNANCE. WE HAVE UNDERNEATH THIS DOME I THINK YOU REACH THE LEVEL OF COMMUNISM THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ABSURD AND YOU LAUGH MISTER BELL. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IF YOU'RE TAKING TAX INCREMENT FINANCING AGAIN AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE IT MEANS MORE AND MORE TAXES FOR THOSE OF US WHO OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS YOU CREATE MORE BONDS YOU CREATE MORE PERSONAL TAXES. AND THIS IS DISCRIMINATION ABOUT THE VERY PEOPLE WHO OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY LIKE HOMES IN SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS ESPECIALLY THANK YOU. NO THANK YOU. OKAY IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. HAILING STEPHENS SUNNYVALE PLEASE REQUIRE CORPORATE TO DO THEIR FAIR SHARE. LET'S JUST A TINY BIT OF THEIR PROFIT THEY CAN GIVE US BILLIONS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION COMMON. SIGNAL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AYE AYE FOR LONG AS I HAVE FOR THE BILL AND I LIKE IT A LOT SO -- CALLERS OF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MOTION BY SENATOR ROSS -- CENTER CABALLERO. I JUST HAVE A QUESTION AND I I AM. IT IT IT'S RELATED TO THE THE FUNDS FOR THE PROGRAM -- SO SO WHAT WHAT THE ANALYSIS SAYS IS THAT -- THERE ARE A SERIES OF PRIORITIES AT THE COMMITTEE. IS GOING TO BE USED TO DETERMINE -- WHAT PROJECTS GET FUNDED? AND AND ONE OF THE PRIORITIES IS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IT'S DEFINED AS A 120% OF THE MEDIAN INCOME AND SO -- ONE OF THE ISSUES I THINK THIS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. BECAUSE IN SOME COMMUNITIES WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE SUBSIDIZING UP TO A 120% OF THE MEDIAN INCOME YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPENT ON THE MEDIAN INCOME IN SOME OF THE BAY AREA CITIES IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUBSIDIZING SOMEONE WHO'S EARNING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN ONE REGION AND AS OPPOSED TO FARMWORKERS AND A BLUE COLLAR WORKERS IN IN MY COMMUNITY AND SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU GET MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. IF YOU'RE SUBSIDIZING THOSE THAT REALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN NYC IN THE COMMUNITY -- AND I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME KIND OF EQUITY RATHER THAN SUBSIDIZING SOMEONE WHO EARNS A HUNDRED AND 20% OF THE MEDIAN INCOME WHEN IT'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO REALLY SUBSIDIZE -- JANITORS AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND FIVE FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS AND SO I I I AM I'M NOT I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER IN TERMS OF WITH THE FORMULA. SHOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I'M I WANT TO PUT THAT PLUGIN THAT THERE BE A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL LOOK AT BECAUSE OTHERWISE AS THEY TRY -- TO TO HAVE GEOGRAPHICAL -- COVERAGE IN THE STATE YOU'RE GONNA RUN INTO THESE ANOMALIES BUT OTHER THAN THAT I THINK IT'S GREAT AND I SUPPORT THE BILL YEAH THE THE EACH COMMUNITY THIS IS AN OPT IN. SO EACH COMMUNITY HOUSES SUBMIT A AND I THINK THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT THE LOOKING AT THOSE KINDS OF FACTORS SO. COULD BE PART OF THE PLAN REQUIREMENTS WE WILL WELL WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE IN [inaudible] OTHERS. TOO SEE WE CAN -- ACCOMMODATE. GREAT THANK YOU I THINK YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE WHERE WE ARE. SIMILAR FEELINGS ABOUT THE SUBJECT [inaudible] SENATOR RUSSELL. YES -- COULD YOU -- PLEASE RESPOND TO THE ISSUE OF THE FUNDS BEING DIVERTED FROM PUBLIC EDUCATION OBVIOUSLY. NO WILL VERY PROTECTIVE OF OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SO IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THAT. I THINK THE THE FEAR OBVIOUSLY IS. GOING BACK TO REDEVELOPMENT OKAY. AND REDEVELOPMENT IS YOU KNOW WAS -- TAX INCREMENT FINANCING. THAT SIMPLY -- ALLOW THE CITY TO CREATE A REDEVELOPMENT SAYING AUTOMATICALLY -- TOOK REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS -- ENDED UP BY THE TIME THAT -- WE DISSOLVE REDEVELOPMENT IT WAS OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF PROPERTY TAXES WERE USED STATEWIDE AND REDEVELOPMENT. THERE'S A LOT OF UNCONTROLLED. OF REDEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SOME COUNTIES HAD AS MUCH AS A FOR A 30% OF THE TOTAL PROPERTY TAX. WENT TO REDEVELOPMENT WHAT THIS PLAN DOES INSTEAD IS TO NOT ALLOW THAT KIND OF SITUATION TO OCCUR AGAIN WITH THIS ALLOWS IS A COMMITTEE. TO BE CREATED AND EACH CITY WOULD SUBMIT AN APPLICATION AND THE COMMITTEE WOULD LOOK AT THAT APPLICATION TO SIDE. OF THE LEVEL OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING TO BE ALLOWED IN THAT APPLICATION FOR THAT CITY. OR COUNTY OR OR OTHER ENTITY THAT THAT CREATES THESE WE ALSO HAVE A PROVISION IN THIS LAW. AND WE HAVE A LETTER FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHICH EXAMINED SB FIVE AND THE LETTER BASICALLY SAYS. THAT SB FIVE WOULD HAVE -- IF IF IMPLEMENTED THE WAY WE HAVE IN THE STATUTE IT WOULD HAD A SUMMARY THIS IS UNDER SB FIVE THE STATE WOULD. BE REQUIRED TO RE BENCH THE RAF REDUCTIONS PART TO RISE BY THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IT WAS IT INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THIS REQUIREMENT MEANS THE STATE EFFECTIVELY WOULD BE COVERING THE COSTS OF THE PROGRAM. THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL JENNER FRONT GENERAL FUND SPENDING RATHER THAN A REDUCTION IN SCHOOL FUNDING SO IT'S IT'S IT'S A MATTER IF THE SCHOOLS WOULD BE MADE WHOLE UNDER THIS LEGISLATION. SO SO THAT'S THE LETTER FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND THEN WE ALSO PUT -- PROVISIONS ADDITIONAL SET UP PROVISIONS IN THE LOBBY ON EVEN EVEN WHEN THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN DATED MARCH EIGHTEENTH WE ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT RECENTLY WE'RE DONE. I'M SORRY SIR SO THE FUNDING WOULD CONTINUE TO COME THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND. EVERY YEAR ON ONGOING BASIS SO IT WOULDN'T TAKE AWAY FROM FUNDING TOWARDS THE PUBLIC EDUCATION. WE WOULD HAVE -- TO DECIDE HOW MUCH MOEY WE WANTED TO PUT. IN THIS PROGRAM WITH THE JOB THE THE BILL ALLOWS FOR A RAMPING UP. FROM TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR UP TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS. TEN YEAR PERIOD SO IT'S A RAMP UP. IT DOESN'T GO UP ALL OF A SUDDEN RAMPS UP TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IT -- IT ALSO -- OF COURSE -- DEALS WITH -- SCHOOLS IN ANOTHER WAY THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS UC. OF AND I THINK YOU HAVE A COPY SHOWS THAT. THIS BILL WILL GENERATE -- SIGNIFICANT LOCAL STATE REVENUES IN AND TAXES AND THEN. I THINK THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER WAS IN IN YOUR REPORT. FOR TAX INCOME. FROM THE LEGISLATION IT WAS A TOTAL OF TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND WE ALSO HAVE IN THE BILL. A WHAT WE CALL AN OFFRAMP OF WHAT I CALL A BUTTON THAT CAN BE PUSHED BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO STOP. THE PROGRAM IF THERE'S A FISCAL DOWNTURN. SO WE HAVE A A PROCESS FOR THAT AS WELL THAT IN A BUDGETARY PROCESS WE CAN DECIDE -- TO STOP THE THE THE SPENDING ON THIS PROPOSED THIS PROGRAM -- DURING A FISCAL -- PROBLEM PERIOD IN THE STATE SO YOU CAN YOU CAN. ACTUALLY HAVE THAT IMPLEMENTED IT ACTUALLY SAYS IS IMPLEMENTED -- BY THE LEGISLATURE -- WHEN -- WHEN -- FISCAL EMERGENCY SICK PLACE SO FOR YOU TO SEE ANY. DANGER OR THREAT TO THE FUNDING TO PUBLIC EDUCATION AS I DON'T BUT I THINK I THINK THE RAISE LEGITIMATE ISSUES ABOUT THE OVERALL LACK OF FUNDING FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION I I CERTAINLY AM SYMPATHETIC. AND THAT'S AN ISSUE I MEAN THAT'S LIKE I THINK THE FEAR IS BASED ON JUST THE LACK OF OVERALL. FUNDING AND I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC -- HOWEVER IT'S UP TO US. TO DEAL WITH THAT QUESTION. THIS WOULD ALLOW A PROGRAM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA. TELL AN ONGOING MAJOR SOURCE OF OF FUNDING WITH CITY GOVERNMENTS. TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AN ATTACK OF ANY ECONOMIC DEVELOPER AND TO ATTACK POVERTY THAT'S WITH THIS PROGRAM WOULD DO. AND IF THERE'S ANY WAY THAT WE COULD MAKE THAT CLEAR THAT THERE'S NO THREAT TO THE PUBLIC FUNDING THAT. IN IF IT'S OKAY WITH MISTER BELL DAY TRIP TO TO SENATOR ALSO. WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN THE CONCERNS VERY SERIOUSLY THE EDUCATION COALITION. ON IN WE HAVE GREATLY APPRECIATED OUR TIME SITTING DOWN WITH HIM SEVERAL TIMES. THAT'S WHY WE WENT TO LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO GET A REVIEW OF THE ENTIRE BILL. AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO BE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN A REVIEW OF THE BILL AND WHY THEY BELIEVE THERE WILL NOT BE A FISCAL IMPACT. TWO K. THROUGH COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATION. AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE ALSO IMPLEMENTED VERY SIMILAR ARE FRANCE THAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH FOR EXAMPLE -- OTHER FUNDING PROGRAMS IT'S IN THE STATE THAT WOULD HAVE TRIGGERS. TO BE TO STOP THE FUNDING DURING TIMES OF THE DECLARED FISCAL EMERGENCY. I COULD DO WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY AS I KNOW EVERYONE ON THE STATUS DOES A MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING SCHOOLS HOLD. WILL PROVIDE THE LA ANALYSIS. ONE SENATE ROTH. JUST A FOLLOW ON ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS JUST OF ASKING ABOUT I MEAN MY UNDERSTANDING. THE CITY IS COMMON AS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE I AGREE RECESSION IN THE SUSPENSION OF PROP NINETY EIGHT IS A RECALL. AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW K. TO TWELVE IS IT DO IT AUTOMATICALLY REQUIRES A BACK FILL FROM PROPERTY TAX. BY ME FROM THE GENERAL FUND WHEN THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUES LESSEN ANTICIPATED AT LEAST TWO CASE OF TWELVE FOR THE MEDICALLY REQUIRES IN THE ANALYSIS. TO THIS BILL. TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH THAT. PROVIDES THAT -- THIS BILL STATED BACKFILL SHALL ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL OF REVENUE AS THEY WOULD HAVE IN ABSENCE OF THE BILL. SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AT LEAST IS TWO K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. OF THE FUNDING STREAM IS SECURE -- IN ANY EVENT ABSENCE -- CATASTROPHE AS WE EXPERIENCE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX SEVEN EIGHT I THINK THAT'S CORRECT IS IT NOT -- SERVO. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- OKAY -- ONE THING -- CENTER BILL YOU INDICATED THE BEGINNING THAT YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AND ANALYSIS I JUST WANNA COVER ONE OF THOSE A MA'AM AND SIR -- IS IT WAS A LITTLE MORE GENERAL IN THE ANALYSIS BUT YESTERDAY WERE ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON A FIVE IN ALICE'S TALKS ABOUT -- MACHINE JURISDICTIONS AN ELIGIBLE IF THEY VIOLATED STATE HOUSING LONG LAST FIVE YEARS -- WE AGREED TO THAT TO IT TOO LIMITED TO THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AND THE DENSITY BONUS -- SO YOU'RE YOU ACCEPT THAT A MOMENT IS ALL OVER. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION -- AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS ON THE BILL THAT DIED IN THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL I'M NOT DYING BOTH AUTHORS FOR THE DILIGENT WORK UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'LL BE A CONTINUING PROCESS -- WE NEED TO DO -- AS I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR IN MY WORK AROUND STREAMLINING REZONING REFORM WE ALSO NEED TO BE SUPPORTING. LOCAL COMMUNITIES NOT JUST TELLING THEM BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT HELPING THEM -- PAY FOR A HELPING THEM PAY FOR THE PLANNING STAFF WHEN THEY NEED IT CETERA. IN THIS IS IMPORTANT -- STOP -- THE AMENDMENTS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY WILL ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY READY TO CREATE THE HOUSING AND WE'LL DO IT QUICKLY AND AND IN A STRONG WAY -- WILL GET.

OF THE IS NO PARTICIPANTS ONLY A SMALL NUMBER ARE HOMELESS. AND THE HOUSING -- THE PROVIDE THAT ARE PROVIDED BY THE CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT IS ONLY TEMPORARY A UCLA STUDY. ON OF THIS PROGRAM THAT THE THE CURRENT PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE FEELS IS SAYS IT FAILS TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM. THE MAIN GOAL. AND AND THAT PARTICIPANTS PARTICIPANTS ONLY RECEIVE TEN MONTHS OF TREATMENT ON THE AVERAGE BEFORE DROPPING OUT OF THE PROGRAM. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO REDIRECT THE CURRENT PROGRAM. IT WILL PROVIDE FUNDS FOR THE THAT THOSE FUNDS TO BE RE DIRECTED BETTER SERVING THE POPULATION. WITH THOSE FUNDS IT REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. ADMINISTERS THE FUNDS TO COUNTIES TO ENSURE THE PARTICIPANTS CAN ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH. AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT THROUGH MEDI CAL SB -- TWO EIGHTY TWO PAINS TO REDUCE THE RECIDIVISM. AND PROMOTE REENTER SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION TO SOCIETY BY PROVIDING SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS ON PAROLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IS A BETTER WAY. THAN CURRENTLY EXIST HIGHER CHEN AYE VOTE AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESSES. WHO ARE HERE TO TO SPEAK TO YOU THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT? GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- S. SENATE BILL NOTED -- THERE IS A STRONG LINK BETWEEN INCARCERATION HOMELESSNESS AND RECIDIVISM -- PEOPLE EXITING PRISON HAVE SIGNIFICANT OF COLD HE'S ACCESSING HOUSING ESPECIALLY HOUSING THEY CAN AFFORD. AND WHEN YOU ADD IN PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS THAT JUST -- COMPLICATES THE THE DIFFICULTIES. FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE ALSO EXPERIENCE RESTRICTIONS AND ACCESS TO OTHER FUNDS THAT COULD BE USED FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR EXAMPLE MANY FEDERAL PROGRAMS RESTRICT -- ACCESS TO FOR EXAMPLE SECTION -- EIGHT BECAUSE THE PERSON IS ON PAROLE OR PROBATION. WITH 40% OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION BEING AFRICAN AMERICAN. THE AN EQUITIES IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TRANSLATE TO AN EQUITIES AND ARE HOMELESS POPULATION. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE DO KNOW HOW TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS AMONG THE VERY VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AS PAROLEES. MULTIPLE -- JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE NATION HAVE CREATED SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE ON PAROLE AND PROBATION. AND AS SENATOR BELL -- DESCRIBES THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE HOUSING WITHOUT LIMITS ON LENGTH OF STAY AS WELL AS INTENSIVE SERVICES TO PROMOTE HOUSING STABILITY INCREASE INCOME AN INCREASE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER -- HEALTH CARE TREATMENT. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE OHIO RETURNING HOME PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES SUPPORTIVE HOUSING TO PEOPLE ON CRUEL WHO OF EXPERIENCE OR AT RISK OF EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND AN EVALUATION WAS DONE TWICE ON THE PROGRAM FOUND SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS. BY MOVING PEOPLE INTO SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS ACTUALLY A CONTROL GROUP AND THE STUDY FOUND THAT OF THE PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM HAD 60% FEWER DAYS INCARCERATED. THAN THE CONTROL GROUP HAD AND HAD THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER -- ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND TO HIGHER INCOME LEVELS AS A RESULT OF THE PROGRAM. AFTER FIVE YEARS OHIO -- MADE THIS PROGRAM PERMANENT AND THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM HAS INCREASED EVER CENTS EACH YEAR TO PROVIDE MORE -- SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THE POPULATION. OTHER STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS HAVE DONE SIMILAR VALUATIONS AND OVER TWENTY STUDIES HAVE FOUND VERY SIMILAR RESULTS. WITH DECREASE COSTS -- OF SIGNIFICANT COST AVOIDED BY -- REDUCING SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM. I'M LIKE SB TEN TEN WHICH PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY AND PASSED ON CONSENT ON THE SENATE FLOOR. AB TWO EIGHTY TWO WE USE EXISTING RESOURCES TO CREATE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE ON PATROL. WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. SB TWO EIGHTY TWO WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE THE EVIDENCE BASED MODEL TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT WILL ALSO CONNECTS PEOPLE TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. SO AND TO CLARIFY THIS BILL DOES NOT -- REALLY -- HAS PEOPLE TRANSFERRING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT TO MEDI CAL MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS SO IT THE PROGRAM WOULD NO LONGER BE FUNDING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT IT WOULD ONLY FUNDS SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- SB TWO EIGHTY TWO WILL ALSO MOVE THE FUNDING TO THE STATE AGENCY THAT HAS THE MOST CULTURAL COMPETENCY AROUND HOUSING. AND THEY ARE CURRENTLY FUNDING A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE SERVING PEOPLE ON CRUEL. A WELL PEOPLE -- WILL NEED TO BE ON PRO WHEN THEY'RE INITIALLY ELIGIBLE THERE IS NO LIMIT ON LENGTH OF STAY BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY WOULD LIVE IN THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING FOREVER. THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS THREE YEARS AND PEOPLE TYPICALLY MOVE ON TO OTHER PERMANENT HOUSING AND HOUSING STABILITY. OHIO DOES HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED MOVING ON AND IT DOES PROVIDE SERVICES TO HELP PEOPLE GROW THEIR INCOMES. TO TRANSITION OUT OF THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND THAT -- MODEL HAS BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY IN OTHER STATES AS WELL. SB TWO EIGHTY TWO WILL ESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH TO REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND FRONT TRANSFORM HOW WE PROVIDE HOUSING TO PEOPLE ON PAROLE. THREE STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT RECORD WITH. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS LENDING CROWDY AND I'M A POLICY FELLOW WITH LEGAL SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH CHILDREN ALL OF US ARE NINE ORGANIZATION. EMPLOYING AND WORKING SO HOLD THE DIGNITY OF FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS I'M ALSO FORMALLY INCARCERATED. I LIKE TO SHARE MY STORY ABOUT TE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING AND KEEPING HOUSING AS A PERSON RE ENTERING SOCIETY POST INCARCERATION. I WAS INCARCERATED I TOOK THE TIME TO WORK ON MYSELF AS HAVE NUMEROUS CLASSES FACILITATED CLASSES ADDRESS IT THINGS FROM MY PAST AND FOCUS ON BEING A BETTER ME. I REALIZE THAT IT WAS MY POOR CHOICES THAT LANDED ME IN MY SITUATION. AND I WAS READY TO MOVE FORWARD IN MY NEW BEGINNING AND BETTER ME. THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL THINGS THAT KEPT ME MOTIVATED AND GROUND IT. PLANNING MY FUTURE. AFTER A LITTLE OVER EIGHT YEARS MY THEY HAVE FINALLY COME AND I WAS READY TO BE PRODUCTIVE SAY SAY THE ST. EAGER TO BUILD A PRODUCTIVE LIFE. I WAS GIVEN FOUR MONTHS INSIDE A TRANSITIONAL HOME. THEY SEEM LIKE THE MOMENT I STE STEP THROUGH THOSE DOORS I WAS GREETED WITH A HARSH REALITY. USUALLY WHEN A PERSON FINDS OUT THAT YOU JUST CAME HOME ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS IS HOW DO YOU FEEL. YES I WAS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO BE HOME BUT I WAS FULL OF ANXIETY WORRY. AND FEAR. I QUICKLY LEARNED UPON MY RELEASE THAT THE AVERAGE RATE WAS AT LEAST A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE. I KNEW THAT FIND AN ADEQUATE HOUSING WAS A VITAL COMPONENT IN THE SUCCESS OF MY FUTURE. BUT I WAS GIVEN JUST FOUR MONTHS TO FIGURE THIS OUT. WITH TRYING TO FIND A LIVABLE WAGE JOB CLOTHING AND MONEY FOR FOOD I FOUND MYSELF WAS SMART FOUND MYSELF LOSING CONFIDENCE AT TIMES. LIVING IN THE COAL WHERE TRANSITIONAL HOME THE MAIN TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WAS HOUSING. I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT I WAS FAR FROM LOAN ALONE IN MY ANXIETY AND WORRIES OUR CASE MANAGERS HAD LITTLE TO NO RESOURCES TO ASSIST SAYS SO WE WERE ALONE IN FIGURING IT OUT. ONE OF MY-ROOMMATES WHO WAS OPEN ABOUT HER MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS WITH ME. A SURPRISE TO ME THAT THIS WAS HER SECOND TIME IN A TRANSITIONAL HOME. SHE SAID THAT. WHEN SHE WAS THERE THE FIRST TIME SHE RAN OUT OF TIME BEFORE FINDING HAVE A BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO FIND A HOUSING? AND SO SHE HAD TO LIVE IN A CAR FOR A WHILE. DUE TO HER MENTAL HEALTH SHE WAS GRANTED ANOTHER FOUR MONTHS INSIDE THE TRANSITIONAL HOME. I WATCH MY ROOMMATES SAID SEARCH FRANTICALLY FOR HOUSING OFTENTIMES ENGAGE IN WHAT I THOUGHT WERE SKETCHY SITUATIONS. SHE USE A CRAIGSLIST AMONG OTHER SOURCES TO FIND ROOMMATES SOMETIMES A LOOK LIKE SHE WILL FIND GOOD LEADS. BUT THEY WERE NEVER CALL HER BACK AFTER MEETING HER. OTHER TIMES I WILL HEAR HER COMMUNICATING WITH MEN WHO WERE RENTING AND SOMETIMES HERE RED FLAGS. THERE WAS NO ONE REALLY THERE TO HELP HER AN ASSIST HER WITH HER SPECIAL NEEDS OR THOSE OF US WHO ARE FACING HOMELESSNESS AFTER TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. AFTER FOUR MONTHS IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING I WAS FORTUNATE TO FIND A PROGRAM THAT HELPS FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE. IN THE COMMUNITY FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS. BUT AT THAT TIME I OTHER FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE I WILL AGAIN FACE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING TO SECURE HOUSING. AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE AREAS IN THE COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE IN WHICH IS GENERALLY IS LEGAL TO DENY HOUSING FOR PEOPLE SOLELY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD. BECAUSE OF THESE CHALLENGES I FACE THE REAL POSSIBILITY OF NOT SECURING SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT ALL. MANY OF MY HOUSE MAY SUFFER FROM SOME FORM OF MENTAL ILLNESS INCLUDING THE TRAUMA OF INCARCERATION AND THE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL SCARS THAT. ON ONE EXPERIENCE IS GOING THROUGH THE SITUATION WHICH I'M ALSO DEALING IN HAILING WITH AT THIS MOMENT. FOR US FINALLY HOUSING IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT WITH A CRIMINAL CONVICTION NOT TO MENTION THE EXTREME COSTS OF HOUSING. WE ALL DESIRED TO MAKE IT ON OUR OWN AND MOVE FORWARD IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY. HOUSING IS NOT A PRIVILEGE IS A NECESSITY PLEASE VOTE YES FOR SB. TWO EIGHTY TWO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY AND SPEAKING TO SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT BILL.

BUT YOU WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT IT MAKES NO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PROVIDERS.

IN ORDER TO FUND THIS IS A WORTHWHILE PROGRAM IN AND OF ITSELF IS MADE UP.

HOMELESSNESS NEEDS. AS WELL NO CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN STRUGGLING TO ADDRESS ITS HOMELESSNESS CRISIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AS OF LAST YEAR ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. ARE HOMELESS NEARLY A QUARTER OF THE NATION'S TOTAL HOMELESS POPULATION. AS CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS FOR ONLY THIS STATISTIC IS BOTH STARTLING AND CONCERNING. A SLIGHTLY UNDER 70% CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF UN SHELTERED HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THE NATION. A RECENT SURVEY FOUND THE PROBLEM IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY WHICH I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT WAS EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT. IT FOUND IN ONE IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY ALONE MY DISTRICT ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN PEOPLE WERE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. 80% OF THEM HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR PEOPLE ARE A SHELTERED. AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN HOMELESS PEOPLE WERE COUNTED AS VETERANS NINETY SEVEN OF THEM LIVED ON THE STREETS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN AND LEGISLATURE AGREED TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO CREATE THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM BLOCK GRANT. HE HAS PROVIDED DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO CITIES COUNTIES AND CONTINUE WHIMS OF CARE. TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. THEY KEEP GRANT PROGRAM HAS ALREADY ASSISTED COMMUNITIES IN BETTER SERVING THEIR HOMELESS POPULATIONS THROUGH SERVICES SUCH AS STREET OUT WHICH IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE DIVERSION PROGRAMS. HOUSING VOUCHERS RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAMS JUST TO NAME A FEW. AS WE ARE ALL AWARE ON MARCH TWENTIETH MAYORS FROM CALIFORNIA'S. THIRTEEN LARGEST CITIES MET WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOME TO ADVOCATE FOR ADDITIONAL STATE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE ON GOING HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. THE MAYOR'S HIGHLIGHTED THE SUCCESS OF THE HEAP PROGRAM WHICH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WENT DIRECTLY TO CITIES WITH A POPULATION OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE. THAT IS ON TRACK TO PRODUCE MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND NEW SHELTER BEDS ACROSS THE STATE. LA MAYOR CARCETTI SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR BREED. AND HARRIS TO DO MAYOR OF ANAHEIM WHICH I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS OF THE HEAP PROGRAM AND TEN OTHER BIG CITY MAYORS STATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HE FUNDING AND HOW IT HAS BEEN USED TO SISTER CITIES IN ADDRESSING THE HOMELESSNESS NEEDS. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE STATE CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO FUND THE HEAT BLOCK GRANT ANNUALLY IN ORDER TO DIRECTLY ASSIST CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ADDRESS THE PERVASIVE ALL MRS CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESS TOM HERNANDEZ. CHIEF HOMELESS OFFICER FOR THE COUNTY SAN MARINO THANK YOU SAID SENATOR KING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TOM RIGHT AND IS COUNTY SUMMER DINO OFFICE ALMOST SERVICES. ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY SAN MARINO I AM PLEASED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE SEVEN THREE LEGISLATION THAT WILL PROVIDE A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION. OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM TO ASSIST LOCAL AGENCIES INCLUDING INCLUDING COUNTIES AND CITIES. TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. THE SEVENTY NO COUNTY OFFICE ALMOST SERVICES AS THE ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITY FOR THE CONTINUUM OF CARE RECEIVED ABOUT NINE POINT THREE MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS THROUGH THE HEAP. THE PROGRAM WILL BE PROVIDING ONE TIME FUNDING FOR TWENTY TWO AGENCIES FOR TWENTY FIVE PROJECTS WHICH INCLUDE SEVEN CITIES AND THE COUNTY UNINCORPORATED AREAS. THE PROCESS IS REALLY SPARKED THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARTNERSHIPS AND MULTI JURISDICTIONAL COLLABORATIONS. THIS IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED A CONTINUUM OF CARE TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERS. THE SEVENTEEN COUNTY CONTINUE OF CARE HAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE A GOVERNING BOARD COMPOSED OF WORK FORTY MEMBERS. WHICH RANGE FROM CITY COUNTY AGENCY BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NONPROFIT FAITH BASED PARTICIPATION. AS WELL AS OVER TWO HUNDRED NONPROFIT PROVIDER REPRESENTATION WITHIN OUR CONTINUE OF CARE. THE FUNDING IS MEANT TO TERMINATE BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT THIS POINT THERE IS NO LONGER AN ONGOING PROVISION FOR CONTINUED SERVICE. THIS FUNDING WILL DEFINITELY ASSIST TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIACY OF HOMELESSNESS IN OUR REGION. HOWEVER ONCE FUNDING IS OVER THE ADDED PROGRAMS STAFFING SERVICES ENDS WHICH PROVIDES ONLY A TEMPORARY RESPITE TO THE INCREASING NUMBER OF HOMELESSNESS AND OUR COMMITTEE ARE HOMELESS IN OUR COMMUNITY. DESPITE THE ONGOING MEET THE REGION HAS SEEN POSITIVE CHANGES AS A RESULT OF INVESTMENT IN PROGRAMS SUCH AS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING HOMELESSNESS OUT REACH AGGRESSIVE USE OF HOUSING FIRST. AND RAPID RE HOUSING PROTOCOLS. OUR OVERALL DECREASED. POINT IN TIME COUNT FROM TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THROUGH TWENTY EIGHTEEN DEMONSTRATES OUR SUCCESS AND COMMITMENT AS DOES THE HOUSING OF OVER TWELVE HUNDRED HOMELESS VETERANS AND SUPERVISORS. IMPLEMENTED A HOUSING INITIATIVE SPECIFICALLY TARGET. TO HOUSE HOMELESS VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. HOWEVER OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ARE REGION'S POINT TIME COUNT NUMBERS HAVE BEEN-INCREASING CONSISTENT WITH THE INCREASES SEENAND WITHIN CALIFORNIA. HE FUNDS WILL HELP TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED EMERGENCY SHELTER RAPIDLY HOUSING SERVICES OUTREACH AND EDUCATION SERVICES AND BRIDGE HOUSING TO THE REGION WHICH FOR US IS TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATIONS PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. WITH THE CLEARLY DEVELOPED HOUSING PLAN. NATIONALLY ACCORDING TO HUG THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY TO MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE DAYS. FOR SEVENTY NO COUNTY CONTINUOUS CARE THE NUMBER RANGES FROM A HUNDRED AND FOUR TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY DAYS AND THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HOUSING AND DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM DATA. WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MANDATING THE USE OF HOUSING FIRST ALONG WITH THE NATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF LOW BARRIER. MINIMAL PENALTY HOUSING EXPEDIENCY THE NEED FOR CONTINUED FUNDS TO PROVIDE THESE TYPES OF SERVICES IS IMPERATIVE TO THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR CONTINUE OF CARE.

TO DEAL WITH -- BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS AND BILLS IN TERMS OF THE HOUSING ISSUE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I SUPPORTED AND I THINK MANY OF US SUPPORTED LAST YEAR I DON'T NEED ANY DISPUTE THAT THE MONEY IS IMPORTANT AND THAT THE NEED IS. HUGE AND OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT SIGNIFICAN ALMOST RELATED FUNDING IN HIS PROPOSED BUDGET -- SO UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SIGNIFICANT APPROPRIATIONS AT THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WILL. ANALYZE AND ASSESS AND I'M SURE CENTER YOU'LL BE WORKING IN THE BUDGET PROCESS ON THIS -- AS A POLICY MATTER I'M COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THIS AND I DO RECOMMEND THAT I BUILT THANK YOU. SO FIVE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SURE YEAH I I I BELIEVE THAT IF IT IS MORE OF A SEMANTICS ISSUE WITH. YOU KNOW THE I GUESS WHATEVER YOU CALL IT BUT I BUT MY FOCUS IS REALLY ON THAT THE PERVASIVE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE. AND WHATEVER FUNDING THAT WE NEED TO DO TO ALLOCATE -- TO TO PROVIDE SUPPORT YOU KNOW I I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SO WITH THAT I I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. AND WE DO HAVE A MOTION. IN MY MOST CENTER MAROC. THE SENATE BILL FIVE SEVENTY THREE BY SENATOR CHIANG THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CENTER WIENER. AYE WIENER AYE MORRELL. BATES. BATES I COVER. DORADO. DORADO AYE MCGUIRE. MCGUIRE I MORE LOCK. MORE LIKE I ROUGH [inaudible] SKINNER. NUMBER. NUMBER I CASKEY. GUSTY NOW. FOR A VOTER SIX ONE THAT'S ENOUGH TO PASS A BILL -- BUT WE'LL KEEP THE ROLL OPEN FOR UP TO MEMBERS THANK YOU. I SEE THE CENTER PORTANTINO'S HERE SO WE WILL GO -- TO AND THERE ARE AM I MISSING ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE NOW CENTER PORTANTINO ITEM NUMBER. TWELVE SB. SIX NINETY FIVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE CHAIRS. AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH MY OFFICE I KNOW -- EVERYBODY WORKED HARD ON THIS BILL -- AND SO I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT -- VISUALLY ASKS -- SB -- SIX NINETY FIVE WELL LET ME JUST START BY SAYING YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS. SORT OF INTRIGUED ME -- ABOUT FOSTER YOUTH I MEAN I I'VE DONE. ALMOST EVERY YEAR IN OFFICE I HOLD THE FOSTER YOU TOWN HALL MY DISTRICT OFFICE IS VERY CLOSE. TO THE FOSTER YOUTH COMMUNITY AND NUMBER OF GROUP HOMES AND IT'S JUST A IT'S JUST A A COMMUNITY THAT I JUST DEEPLY CARE ABOUT AND I'VE. BEEN STAGGERED BY THE STATISTICS OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER MANSA PATIENT -- WITH MANY FOSS YOUTH -- ENDING UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM -- I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT WE COULD DO MORE AND AND TRY TO ENCOURAGE LASTING FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND SO. I WAS INTRIGUED BY THIS IDEA OF MAYBE WE CAN INCENTIVIZE -- FAMILIES TO TAKE IN FOSTER YOUTH. BY CREATING A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM -- ANTI IT. SERENA AND SO. YOU KNOW WHEN THE STAFF CAME BACK AND SAID YOU KNOW CAN WE LOWER FROM 10% 25% I SAID ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I I I JUST WANT TO SEE. IF IF AN INCENTIVE WORKS. BECAUSE I HAVE THIS CRAZY IDEA THAT IF WE CAN CREATE. THIS PROGRAM. AND CREATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH FAMILIES BEYOND EMANCIPATION THAT WE MIGHT BE HELPING A CHILD. YOU KNOW ONCE THEY'RE OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND SO THAT'S SORT OF THE THEORY BEHIND IT AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF WORKING WITH US TO GET THIS. IN A POSITION WHERE I BELIEVE THE CHAIR -- WILL HAVE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE THEORY BEHIND IT IT'S NOT. TO TO TO GIVE ANYBODY RELIEF IT'S NOT TO GIVE ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT JUST TO TRY TO CREATE SOME SYSTEM. TO HELP INCENTIVIZE PLACING FOSTER YOUTH IN. SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND SO THAT'S THE HEART OF IT -- AT THE SAME TIME WE WERE APPROACHED BY THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE -- TO TALK ABOUT -- HOW SHARING ARRANGEMENTS FOR LOW INCOME SENIORS WHO FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS OR ABOUT TO BE HOMELESS ARE HARM HURTING WHEN THEY'RE RENTING OR BUYING -- AND SO YOU KNOW WE WANT ALSO HELP THAT POPULATION BY -- GIVING SOME -- COMMONSENSE TO HOME SHARING WITH SENIOR SO THIS BILL DEALS WITH BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES -- I THINK THEY'RE BOTH YOU KNOW WHERE THE EFFORTS AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. BALANCE IS FOR YOU TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MAP SELECT THANK YOU. OKAY -- IS THERE ANY SUPPORT OF TESTIMONY. I SEE NINE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION [inaudible] WERE YOU. WITHIN THE STANCE BEFORE. YES IS THE CENTER HAS SAID WE HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE BRIAN AUGUSTA. WHICH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. IN AS A SENATOR PORTANTINO NOTED WE HAVE HAD A SIMILAR POSITION ON HIS PRIOR BILL AND WE'VE SEEN OTHER BILLS FROM OTHER AUTHORS. AND IT JUST NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION -- NOW OBVIOUSLY WE REGRET OPPOSING THIS BILL BECAUSE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOAL OF INCREASING FOSTER YOUTH PLACEMENTS AND SHARED HOUSING ARRANGEMENTS. WE DON'T AGREE WITH THIS APPROACH AND IT'S YOU KNOW COMING ON THE HEELS OF A A LONG. DISCUSSION THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT HOW DO WE INCREASE THE HOUSING SUPPLY. THIS BILL WOULD. DECREASE. OUR POTENTIAL SITES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. BECAUSE IT WOULD IT WOULD TAKE OUR REGION HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION AND ALLOW THE CITY TO REDUCE IT EVEN BY THE 5% THAT -- THE COMMITTEE IS REQUESTED. REDUCE IT BY 5% WHICH WOULD CORRESPOND TO REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT A CITY MUST IDENTIFY ITS HOUSING ELEMENT TO MEET THAT NEED. AND WE THINK THAT'S THE WRONG APPROACH. TO ADDRESSING THE NEED THAT MISTER PORTANTINO HAS IDENTIFIED -- WOULD LOVE TO FIGURE OUT SOME OTHER INCENTIVES BUT ALLOWING A CITY TO REDUCE ITS PLANNING FOR HOUSING TO DO THAT. WHO DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT OUR HOUSEHOLD AGREES TO TAKE EITHER? A MEMBER OF EITHER POPULATION BUT WE WILL SEE A LOSS OF PRODUCTION OF NEW HOUSING WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEED AND AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED. ANNUAL OR WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM ZERO F. WE NEED MORE SITES FOR HOUSING NOT FEWER AND UNFORTUNATELY THE UPSHOT OF THIS BILL IS THAT CITIES A TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM WILL. BE ALLOWED TO PRE PROVIDE FEWER SITES FOR NEEDED NEW HOUSING WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR TO FIND WAYS. TO GET MORE FOSTER PLACEMENTS BUT THIS IS THE WRONG APPROACH. THIRTY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. I'D LIKE TO RESPOND IF I COULD. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND BEFORE IN YOUR CLOTHES PERHAPS YOU COULD. RESPOND ARE I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO SOME SPECIFIC. ISSUES MEASURE SIR I'LL ASK YOU TO RESPOND WITH A FIFTY FOUR I THINK THE KEY THING. WORD WAS POTENTIAL SO UNDER THE CURRENT HOUSING LAW. WHEN YOU PLAN FOR HOUSING IT'S? YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY BUILD IT AND SO WE'RE NOT REDUCING. ANYTHING WERE PLACING POR. FOSTER CHILDREN IN HOMES IN ORDER TO GET. THE 5% IN ORDER TO QUALIFY IT'S NOT A THEORETICAL PLACEMENT. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PLACE. THIS NEEDY CHILD IN A HOME. YOU DON'T GET A 5% REDUCTION IN YOUR HOUSING ELEMENT JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU WANT. TO IF YOU ACTUALLY PLACE A CHILD IN A HOME. IT UP 25%. YOU CAN MEET YOUR HOUSING REQUIREMENTS OR NOT GETTING OUT OF ANYTHING. AND WE'RE TAKING SOMETHING THAT'S IN THEORY. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY SAYING IT HAS TO BE HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION -- AND I THINK THIS IS A POPULATION THAT'S POOR. A POPULATION THAT SOMETIMES DOESN'T HAVE A FAMILY UNIT. IT'S A POPULATION THAT'S OFTENTIMES FORGOTTEN. AND IF WE CAN CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR THAT ACTUALLY PLACES KIDS IN A HOME. FOR A MERE 5% IN CENTER OF I THINK THAT'S A LAUDABLE GOAL IN A LAUDABLE PURPOSE AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH WHAT. YOU KNOW HOW TO PLACE FOSTER USE FOR FIFTY YEARS. AND YEAH IT'S AN OUT OF THE BOX THING IT DOESN'T BUILD ANYTHING BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY ANYTHIG BUT TO PROVIDE SHELTER FOR A FOSTER YOUTH [inaudible] ANYWAY. I CENTER MY COUNTY. OF RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH WITH YOUR COMMENT -- I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD A PROBLEM WITH UNDER RENO HAVING CITIES PRODUCE HOUSING AND AND WE ALL AGREE MAYBE WELL DONE AGREE BUT WE WE REALIZE IT JUST IDENTIFYING SITES. THAT WE'VE DONE FOR HOUSING ELEMENT AFTER HOUSE MANAGE TO HOUSING ELEMENT ISN'T ISN'T ENOUGH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT YOU WANT IS. YOUR THIS THIS MECHANISM WILL NOT PRODUCE ANY NEW HOUSING YOU'LL JUST SAY IT WILL JUST SAY FOLKS THAT IF YOU PUT TOGETHER SOME FORK FOSTER USE THE PUT HIM THERE IN A STABLE ENVIRONMENT. THEN YOU CAN COUNT THAT TOWARDS TOWARDS THE THE THE NUMBER I PERCENT. WHEN THE WAY IT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT YOU GET A CREDIT TOWARDS THE PRODUCTION UNDER RENO BUT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY BUILD THE ANY -- OF OF THAT THE HOUSING I THINK THAT'S YEAH WE JUST HAD A PREVIOUS BILL THAT WANTED. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS CONTINUOUSLY I DIDN'T SUPPORTER BUT MAYBE THAT'S A POT OF MONEY THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND GET THAT TYPE OF WORK THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE. YOU WANT TO CREATE THAT STABILITY AND ALSO EXTEND THE TIME I BELIEVE YOU WANT YOU WANT THE PEOPLE TO BE IN A STABLE FOSTER. ENVIRONMENT PROVIDING A HOME. WE'RE NOT BUILDING A HOUSE. PROVIDING A HOME WE'RE NOT BUILDING A HOUSE REGRETTED ME REGRETTABLY MISTER CHAIR I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT I SEE THAT THE RENO AVENUE -- I I I'M JUST NOT THERE I'M AND IN ORDER TO QUALIFY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR HOUSING ELEMENT. ALREADY STE. CERTIFIED SUFFICE SO IN ORDER TO QUALIFY GOING FORWARD. YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR HOUSING ELEMENT ALREADY CERTIFIED. IN AND YOU GET A FLOW AGAIN WE'RE NOT GIVING [inaudible] RELIEF OR PROVIDING HOMES. 45%. ANY OTHER A COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS -- SENATOR BATES ADMIN CENTER MORE LOCK. I'LL SEND YOU PORTANTINO I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING ABSOLUTELY BUT THE WAY WE READ THE BILL IN OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HAVE A PLAN. BUT YOU SAID YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO MAKE A PLACEMENT SO I THINK THAT LOOKS TO BE. REALLY CLARIFIES. IN THE BILL AND WHAT I LIKE IS THE FACT THAT ALL OF THIS HOUSING ISSUES ABOUT THE HOME OF SO YOU'RE TAKING AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO'S HOMELESS AND PROVIDING A DOMICILE FOR THEM. ON A PERMANENT BASIS. AND WE KNOW FROM THE POINT -- BECAUSE THE POINT. ACCOUNT. THAT A NUMBER OF OUR FOSTER KIDS. WHO ARE EMANCIPATED LET'S SAY FALL INTO THE THE DRUG CULTURE? AND THEY BECOME SUBSTANCE ABUSERS AND THEY'VE ALSO DEVELOP IF THEY DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE PHONE. HEALTH ISSUES WE HAVE THAT I MEAN THE SOBER LIVING HOMES PERFECT EXAMPLE SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO MAKE IT FIT MAKES IT TO THE FLOOR TO MAKE THAT CLEAR BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I THINK THAT FROM THE SKI PACKAGE WE JUST HAVE TO PUT A PLAN. NO NO NO IT'S MY INTENTION THAT YOU ONLY. GET THE FIVE FOR UP 25%. IT'S COMMENSURATE WITH THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF CHILDREN YOU PLACE IN HOMES SO YOU HAVE A LEANER REQUIREMENT. AND THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO COUNTING YOU HAVE TO REACH THE 5%. IF YOU HAVE THEM PLACE TO GET A PERCENTAGE OF HOW MANY CHILDREN YOU ACTUALLY PLACE. 255% THAT YOU'VE MADE OUT OF THE 1100% RENO REQUIREMENTS GOT IT OKAY THERE'S NO THEORY YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PLACE AND IT'S VOLUNTARY FOR THE CITY STOP IN SO ANYWAY. FERGUSON REMOTEST THE SYSTEM THAT AND THAT IS THE IMPORTANT POINT PLACE NUMBER SERVICE NOT PLAN OR I'LL CLEAR THAT UP THAT'S OKAY SO IF YOU'LL YOU'LL ACCEPT THAT AMOUNT I'M SON OKAY SO WILL WORK OR NOT. CAPTION IS NEVER BEEN MY INTENT TO MAKE THIS THEORY YOU ONLY CAN MEET THE THE THE NUMBER IF YOU ACTUALLY PLACE MUCH OLDER AND IN HOMES. THANK YOU CENTER MARK RESEARCHER CENTER PORTANTINO FOSTER CARE IS A COUNTY. PROGRAM. AND THEY USUALLY PLACE YOUTH IN HOMES [inaudible] SO. ONE WHAT IT WHAT WHAT MEDIA WE TRYING TO FILL WITH IF THEY ARE IN HOMES. IN THE EARLY ARE YOU SAYING THAT IF WE DON'T PLACE IN THERE AND LIKE WE HAVE ORANGE WOULD IN ORANGE COUNTY THE COUNTY OFFICE HOUSES EMINENT. NOT EVERY FOSTER YOUTH AS IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME MANY ARE IN GROUP HOMES. BUT I HAVE A SAY IN A GROUP HOME SO AND THEN THEY GET EMANCIPATE SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF AMEND UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. YOU'RE USING THE TERM YOUTH SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS EIGHTEEN AND OLDER THAN. I'M HOPING THAT IF WE PLACE YOUNGER FOSTER YOUTH INTO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THE FAMILY BOND WILL CARRY. FORWARD BEYOND EMANCIPATION. SO I'M HOPING TO CREATE A WHOLE NEW INCENTIVE PROGRAM OF NONTRADITIONAL FOSTER YOUTH I ENVISION COMMUNITIES WORKING WITH THEIR CHURCH COMMUNITIES GOVERNOR QANTAS CLUB OUT OF THE BOX BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN. GIVING A CITY IN AND SENATE WHEN REALLY WE GOT WE GOT TO GET THAT THE HOMES THE PARENTS THE THE CATALYTIC BUT THAT'S THE INCENTIVE FOR THE CITIES SO. COMMUNITY MINDED ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN THE CITY. CAN CREATE THIS ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS AND THE INCENTIVE FOR THE CITY IS TO GET. 5%. FROM THEORY ON THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED TO ACTUALLY PLACING THESE KIDS IN HOMES [inaudible] SO. YES COUNTIES THE ONLY DOWN TO MY PERSONAL LEVELS I GOT THIRTY FOUR CITIES SO NOW I'VE GOT A CITY THAT'S REALLY ACTIVE TRYING TO FIND PARENTS ARE DOING COMMUNITY ARE ALL BASED ON THEIR OWN VOLUNTEER EFFORT AND IT CAN BECAUSEMAYBE WE THE KIDS ARE NOW HOUSE. MORE IN ONE CITY ABOVE THE NORMAL AVERAGES. THEY SAY HEY WAS OUR EFFORTS. TO GET THESE KIDS AND HOMES IN OUR CITY THEREFORE WE SHOULD GET ARENA CREDIT. OF UP 25% MY GETTING IT UP OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU AND IT'S ALL VOLUNTEER. IF THEY DON'T PLACE THE KIDS THEY DON'T GET THE BENEFIT AND NO HARM NO FOUL IN. THE RAIN THERE ARE HOUSING ELEMENT IS. APPROVED TO START WITH SO. EIGHT IT'S JUST AN OUTSIDE THE BOX INCENTIVE TO TRY TO HELP KIDS GET HOME SO YES WE'RE NOT BUILDING ANYTHING BUT WE'RE PROVIDING HOMES. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY -- THANK YOU TO EVERYONE INTO. AND TO SENATOR -- I AS CENTER KNOWS I SOME QUESTIONS ON THE SPOKE FIRST CAME TO US AND I STILL THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME WORK -- IN THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF DEFINING PARTICULARLY THE NEW ELEMENT -- THAT THE SENIOR CONGRESS HAS TO PUT IN -- AND BUT I AM COMFORTABLE WITH THE REDUCTION FROM 10% 25% -- AND SOME OF THE GUARD RAILS SO WE PUT IN-- PASSING THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE -- SO IS THERE -- A MOTION -- BY SENATOR BATES -- AND I'M SORRY DID NOT KEEPING UP SOONER CLOSE NO I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HOME VERSUS HOUSE AND SO I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE. AND I JUST THINK THIS LITTLE TINY ELEMENT. WILL HELP SOME KIDS I I I I WAS STRUCK WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. I HAD A GROUP OF TEENAGERS COME TO SEE ME WHO ARE ABOUT TO BE EMANCIPATED AND THIS ONE YOUNG WOMAN SAID TO ME DURING THE MEETING WITH MY STAFF SHE SAID LISTEN. I'VE GOT MY APPLICATION I'M GETTING EMANCIPATED I'VE GOT MY APPLICATION AT EVERY STARBUCKS IN TOWN AND IF I DON'T GET A JOB WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. I'M GONNA HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. PROSTITUTION AND SELLING DRUGS. AND I JUST SAID TO MYSELF NO TEENAGER SHOULD BE EVEN COGNIZANT OF MAKING THAT TYPE OF A FAMILY DECISION FOR HERSELF. AND YOU KNOW SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP FOSTER YOUTH EVERY CHANCE WE CAN. I JUST THINK THIS IS A LAUDABLE EFFORT TO DO IT AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR HELPING. I WITHOUT WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. SENATE BILL SIX NINE FIVE A SENATOR PORTANTINO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE AND HUMAN SERVICES. SENATOR WIENER AYE WIENER AYE MORRELL. BATES. BATES I COVER DORADO. REQUIRE. MCGUIRE AYE MORLOCK [inaudible] ROUGH [inaudible] SKINNER. NUMBER. NUMBER HI BUT CASKEY. CASTING NOW. SO THE VOTERS -- FOUR TO ONE BUT WE WILL LEAVE THE ROAD OPEN THANK YOU BETTER THANK YOU -- NEXT -- TO WE WILL GO TO SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HIS BILL ITEM FIVE SB THIRTEEN CENTER YOU READY GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS CONTAINING COMMENT SIX AND SEVEN IN THE ANALYSIS. SB THIRTEEN IS IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND LIKE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. WERE MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS EIGHTY USER CHEAPER THERE QUICKER TO BUILD AND THEY REQUIRE NO PUBLIC SUBSIDY HOWEVER HUNDREDS OF HOMEOWNERS ARE STOPPED IN THEIR TRACKS WHEN THEY HAVE WHEN THEY'RE HANDED THE SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR. A BILL FOR DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES -- SB THIRTEEN CREATES A TWO YEAR FEE STRUCTURE WELL WHICH CHANGES EIGHTY USE -- BASED ON THEIR SIZE TO TAKE IN CONSIDERATION THAT THE IMPACT OF THE EIGHTY YOU ON THE NEIGHBORHOODS INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES IN IS INHERENTLY DIFFERENT. FROM OTHER TYPES OF NEW HOUSING THESE EXCESSIVE FEES COUPLED WITH A STRINGENT CODE STANDARDS HAVE PROMPTED MANY HOMEOWNERS TO BUILD A TO USE WITHOUT PERMITS WE ALL KNOW SOMEBODY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND THE CORNER. IT HAS AN PERMITTED EIGHTY YOU -- RECENT STUDY PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION ESTIMATES THAT THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND PERMITTED EIGHTY USING THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA ALONE. SARAH SENATE BILL THIRTEEN ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY CREATING AN AMNESTY PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS A HOMEOWNER TO BRING EIGHTY YOU INTO COMPLIANCE IF LOCAL OFFICIALS DETERMINED THAT THE NEEDED FIXES ARE NOT NECESSARY TO PROTECT. HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE RESIDENTS SENATE BILL. THIRTEEN HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY SLIM DOWN. SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE LAST YEAR'S SENATE BILL EIGHT THREE ONE BY REMOVING REQUIREMENTS PERTAINING TO FLOOR AREA RATIO IS. SET BACKS AND LOT SIZE. WITH ME TODAY IS SAMARA CISNEROS FROM THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AND STEVE ALEJO'S FROM. I BUILDER OF PRE FAB EIGHTY USE MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] MY WITNESSES. SAID HE ACT AFTERNOON. FIVE AS HUMANS THE CENTERS OF THE BAY AREA COUNCIL A NONPROFIT PUBLIC POLICY ORGANIZATION ADVOCATING FOR A STRONG ECONOMY AND A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR EVERYONE WHO LIVES HERE. HOURS OF YOUR HOUSING SHORTAGE CONTINUES TO DRIVE UP HOUSING CRISIS ADDRESSING SHORTFALL OF THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES WITHIN SEVEN YEARS SEEMS DON TEEN. BUT THIS AMBITIOUS GOAL SHOULD MOTIVATE US TO TAKE BOLD ACTION NOW. WE HAVE SEVERAL BARRIERS TO OVERCOME BUT WE SHOULDN'T UNDERESTIMATE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND SB THIRTEEN CAN HELP PROVIDE A VIABLE SOLUTION TO OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM. FOR EXAMPLE EIGHTY USE OUR FORMAL BY DESIGN BECAUSE LESS TO BUILD AND RUN FOR LESS AND THIS IS CRITICAL WHEN IN CALIFORNIA THE AVERAGE COST FOR HOUSING IS HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. AND EVEN MORE SO IN METROPOLITAN AREAS IN SAN FRANCISCO -- CLOSE TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ACCORDING TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN TURNER CENTER REPORT ALMOST 60% OF EIGHTY YOU OWNERS READ TO THE UNITS AT BELOW MARKET RATES. AN ENTRY TO MARKET IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS ARE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. IF JUST 10% OF CALIFORNIA'S NINE MILLION. NINE MILLION OWNERS OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WERE TO CREATE EIGHTY USE THAT COULD EASILY AND QUICKLY ADD NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND MUCH NEEDED HOMES. ALTHOUGH WE MADE SOME PROGRESS IN LOWERING AT RESTRICTIONS FOR THE PASSAGE OF SB TEN SIXTY NINE WHICH WE WERE PROUD TO SPONSOR. SB THIRTEEN BUILT ON HIS LEGISLATION AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SOLUTIONS. AND TAXIS ARE MAJOR BURDEN FOR THE TYPICAL HOMEOWNER AND ARE DESIGNED FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION THAT TRIGGER INCREASE SERVICES AND UTILITIES. THE TIERED FEE REDUCTION PROPOSED IN SB THIRTEEN STRIKES A FAIR BALANCE FOR BOTH HOMEOWNERS AND AGENCIES. ELIMINATING A LOCAL REQUIREMENT OF OWNER OCCUPANCY IT'S ALSO KEY TO UNLOCKING ITS HOUSING SOLUTION. IN CALIFORNIA ALMOST TWO MILLION SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ARE RENTER OCCUPIED. THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY REQUIREMENT REDUCING OPTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS. IT'S FOR LEGISLATION WILL ADD THOUSANDS OF NEW HOMES TO CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING STOCK. FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE. COUNSEL IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB. THIRTEEN GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS STEVEN ELSE I'M THE PRESENT OWNER OF VALLEY ON DEVELOPMENT AND EIGHTY YOU CONTRACTOR AND CREATIVITY YOU A EIGHTY YOU. CAN FACTORY COMPANY BASED IN FAIRFIELD CALIFORNIA -- WE'VE BEEN BUILDING A USE FOR THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS. SO WE'RE VERY INTIMATE WITH THE PROCESS BOTH PRE AND POST -- LEGISLATION CHANGES -- WE BUILT OVER  HUNDRED SEVENTY OF THEM ACROSS PROBABLY MORE THAN NINETY FIVE JURISDICTIONS. SO WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS -- THEY GO WITH EIGHTY USE IN IN IN TERMS OF WHAT CITIES ARE GOOD AND WHAT CITIES ARE ARE BAD TO DEAL WITH. JUST A QUICK -- JUST A QUICK UNDERSTANDING WHAT WHAT EIGHTIES ARE ON THE TYPICALLY RANGE IN SIZE FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY SQUARE FEET. ON UP TO ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET -- THEY CAN COST ANYWHERE FROM THE LOW IN FROM ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND ON UP TO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THERE'S A THERE'S QUITE A RANGE OF BOTH IN SIZE AND PRICING. OF EIGHTY YEARS -- I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE MRS DAY LISTENING TO LOTS OF DISCUSSION ABOUT FOUR BY HOUSING -- I DON'T. I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY OTHER SOLUTIONS OUT THERE THAT CAN PERCENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS I MEAN THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OUT THERE -- I HEAR A LOT OF TALK I SEE A LOT. I WATCHED WHAT'S GOING ON WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT BILLS. AND I SEE A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING AND YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT YOU KNOW MOST OF THE THE FOR ONE THOUSAND UNITS. STAR OFFICE PROBABLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BAY AREA AND IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO SEE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT HAVE A PRICE TAG OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BAY AREA. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A TO USE WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING VERY UNIQUE. WE ALSO NEED TAKING CONSIDERATION THAT THESE HOMES DO NOT REQUIRE ANY SUBSIDIES SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING WHERE WE'RE ASKING STATE TO HAND OUT MONEY TO MAKE I IS HAPPEN. HOMEOWNERS HAVE THE INCENTIVE ON THEIR OWN EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. HAS SOMEBODY IN THEIR LIFE THAT COULD USE ONE OF THESE I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT SPARKING CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING AND GATHER A GROUP OF PEOPLE AROUND ME OR SHARE IN THE PROBLEMS. IN THIS IS JUST A IT'S IT'S JUST A PRODUCT THAT IS SO NEEDED. SO WITH THAT IN CONSIDERATION WHY ARE WE BUILDING ANYMORE. I MEAN WE WE SHOULD BE BUILDING TONS OF RIGHT I MEAN IT'S JUST IT THEY'RE THEY'RE AFFORDABLE -- EVERYBODY NEEDS SOME HOMERS WANNA. WE SERVE IMPEDIMENTS I MEAN WE'RE STILL WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT WHEN YOU TAKE WHEN YOU TAKE THAT EXAMPLE OF A SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR EIGHTY YOU. AND YOU TACK ON FORTY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF IMPACT FEES. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THAT HOME OR TO MAKE THAT DECISION. AND SAY YOU KNOW I WANNA GO AND PULL THE TRIGGER FOR SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF ACTUAL PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION. AND HERE. THE MAN OR MONEY THAT GOES NOWHERE IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WHAT IMPACT FEES ARE BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT IMPACT FEES WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING. PERMIT FEES OR THE THE APPLICATION REVIEW FEES THESE FEES ARE CHARGED INDEPENDENTLY BY THE PLANNING THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT. IMPACT FEES OF THOSE OF THE FEES ARE COMING FROM THE WATER DISTRICT. SCHOOL DISTRICT -- PARKS AND RACKS OF FIRE SANITATION DISTRICT -- SO SO END AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THOSE FEES ARE ACTUALLY TO PROVIDE A NEW SERVICE TO THAT LOT THAT SERVICE READY EXISTS ON THE A LOT. IS READY HOME THERE AND AT THAT PRIMARY HOMES ALREADY PAID FOR THOSE SERVICES. ADDING TO THIS PROBLEM ON A DAILY BASIS WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WHEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE CONFRONTED WITH THE SITUATION. AND THE QUESTION COMES UP WHY DON'T I JUST DO IN ADDITION THAT. THAT VERY SAME ADDITION OF THE VERY SAME SIZE IS USUALLY NOT CHARGE THOSE IMPACT FEES. SO NOW WE HAVE THE SITUATION WHERE A HOMEOWNER IS DECIDING. WHETHER THEY SHOULD DO AN EIGHTY YOU OR THEY SHOULD JUST DO A SIMPLE ADDITION. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT WITH THAT SCENARIO IS THAT WERE DISCOURAGING THEM FROM ACTUALLY BUILDING AFFORDABLE UNIT. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY WE'RE ACTUALLY STEERING THEM TOWARDS A SOLUTION WHICH BASICALLY FURTHER EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM BY CREATING MORE MAKE MANSIONS AND BIGGER HOMES THAT COST MORE AND MAKE THE DEVICE EVEN. FURTHER SO I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO DO -- DIDN'T DO THIS OPPORTUNITY JUSTICE BY FINDING WAYS TO REDUCE THOSE FEES AND MAKE IT EASIER ON THE CONSUMER MAKE A RELATIVE TO THE ACTUAL COST THAT THE BURDEN WITH FOR THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THAT UNIT. ON A TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS UNIT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FEES IS IS. IS APPROPRIATE BUT ON A SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR UNIT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FEE IS NOT APPROPRIATE. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT COMES UP EVERY NOW AND THEN AS OUR OCCUPANCY. AND I JUST WANT TO DO A QUICK POINT ON THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S BROUGHT UP IN A LOT OF CONVERSATION AND I KNOW THE THE EPA AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS -- CAN REALLY WANTED. WANT THE OWNER OCCUPANCY THERE -- I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT THE THE THERE ARE THERE ARE FOUR CITIES IN IN A NORTH AMERICA THEY'VE DONE OVER A THOUSAND EIGHTY YEARS. AND WHAT ALL FOUR OF THEM HAVE IN COMMON THEY DON'T HAVE DEMOCRACY REQUIREMENTS. THEY ALSO REMOVED A LOT OF PARKING RESTRICTIONS AND IMPACT FEES AS WELL. BUT THE BUT THE POINT IS THAT. WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS FOR THE HOMEOWNER TO MAKE THIS DECISION IF WE WANT THESE TO BE OUT THERE IN HIGH NUMBERS. AND WE DON'T WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY COMING FROM THE STATE TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THE HOMEOWNERS WAY TO MAKE IT EASIER TO DO THE SAME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ARE TO RESPECT ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WE ARE% IN SUPPORT OF OF THE BILL WE DO APOLOGIZE THAT OUR LETTER WAS DELIVERED YESTERDAY -- AND URGE YOU TO VOTE HI. LOUIS MANTE WITH CALIFORNIA BE WE WERE LATE IN GETTING OUR LETTER IN AS WELL BUT AREN'T SUPPORT THE BILL. TWENTY WITH A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT SITUATION WHERE SPORTS ALL. YOUR LETTER WAS IN ON TIME. THANK YOU PARTNERS OKAY ANY ADDITIONAL SO ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT HER. SORRY IT'S BEEN A KIND OF THAT -- ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING SHARON MEMBERS I'M SPEAKING OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION LAUREN TABLE AND SAT REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION I'M WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. AMONG THE BILL BUT I DO FIRST WANT TO APPRECIATE -- THE DIET I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT SB THIRTEEN IS AND THE WORK THAT SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE HAS DONE TO SLIM DOWN -- SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WERE INITIALLY PROPOSED IN PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE BILL -- WE DO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND SO FROM THAT STARTING POINT PERHAPS WERE NOT AS FAR APART ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE. A GENERALLY SPEAKING A PA I'M IS CONCERNED THAT WE DO SEE ANNUAL CHANGES BEING PROPOSED EACH YEAR TO THE EIGHTY LAW -- WE DO KNOW AS EVERYBODY HAS -- SCENE THAT WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN I'M AT PROTECT PRODUCTION OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WITH THE CHANGES IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN I MEAN WE DO JUST GET CONCERNED WITH GOING BACK REVISING THOSE ORDINANCES THAT EVERYBODY HAS ALREADY ADOPTED OR IS IN THE PROCESS OF OF DOING BUT AGAIN A PEAK IS NOT OPPOSED EIGHTY USE WE DON'T WANT TO PUT. ANY RESTRICTIONS OR WE DON'T WANT THINGS TO BE IN PLACE THAT LIMIT A D. AS WE JUST THINK THAT THERE DOES NEED TO BE SOME PARAMETERS AROUND CERTAIN THINGS AND SO. ON THE ISSUE OF HONOR OCCUPANCY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CONCERN I THINK APA HAS AND ONE THAT CERTAINLY IS NEAR AND DEAR TO SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI -- WE ARE JUST GENERALLY CONCERNS THAT -- WITH THE REMOVAL AS OWNER OCCUPANCY AS A TOOL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THAT IS -- THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO REQUIRE HONOR OCCUPANCY -- THE MORE LIKELIHOOD OF AN OWNER THAT IS -- RESIDING IN THEIR DWELLING WHETHER IT'S THE DO YOU OR THE THE MAIN UNIT. THAT WILL MORE THAN LIKELY HOPEFULLY RENT OUT THEIR UNIT FOR A MORE AFFORDABLE RENT AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT REMOVING THOSE -- OWNER OCCUPANCY RESTRICTIONS OUR ABILITY -- FROM THE BILL DOES POTENTIALLY INCENTIVIZE INVESTORS TO COME IN AND EITHER RENTS HOW IT'S PURCHASE A LOT WITH AN EIGHTY YOU OR AT AN EIGHTY OR I'D BOTH -- AND THEN RENT THEM OUT FOR WHATEVER THE MARKET WILL BILL BEAR AND WE DON'T WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT WE KNOW THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS DO USE OWNER OF ORDER OCCUPANCY AS A TOOL TO THAN. A PLACE AFFORDABILITY RESTRICTIONS ON THE UNIT SO THAT IF ON OCCUPANCY IS NOT REQUIRED FOR EXAMPLE SANTA ROSA WILL WAIVE UNDER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. I KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT DO HAVE OTHER HARDSHIP WAIVERS IN THE EVENT THAT THE OWNER MOVES OUT OF THE IS THE MAIN OR THE X. AT THE EIGHTY YEAR OLD -- OR NEEDS TO MOVE FOR WORK RELATED REASONS WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME ISSUES WITH FINANCING ON OWNER OCCUPANCY -- WE REALLY DON'T WANT THAT TO BE -- THE IMPEDIMENT TO THE TO BEING ABLE TO STILL REQUIRES SO WERE REALLY HELPFUL THAT WE CAN TRY TO WORK WITH A SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI. ON MAY BE FINE TUNING SOME LANGUAGE IN THOSE INSTANCES SO THERE ARE HARDSHIP WAIVERS AND THERE IS THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE THAT BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND AND FOR THE REASONS I'VE STATED FOR NOW WE ARE OPPOSE LESS AMENDED THANK YOU. EVENING CROWNED ROSSI WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WE TOOK IN POST POSITION ON FRIDAYS MY APOOGIES FOR THE LATE OPPOSITION -- FOR OUR PARKING FIRE DISTRICTS IMPACT FEES ARE. AN ESSENTIAL SOURCE OF REVENUE IN PARTICULAR FOR A FIRE DISTRICTS THE IMPACT FEES TYPICALLY GO TO PAY FOR NEW EQUIPMENT FOR NEW ENGINES TO SERVICE. AREAS AS POPULATION DENSITY INCREASES FOR OUR PARK DISTRICTS THE IMPACT FEES TYPICALLY GO TOWARDS ESTABLISHING NEW PARKS THIS POPULATION IN A I CITIES AND IN INCREASE -- SO AGAIN WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR OUR DISTRICTS INTO NEW PROVIDING A PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES AS WELL AS SERVICES FOR QUALITY OF LIFE IF SB THIRTEEN MOVES FOR THANK YOU. PLEASE PRESS. ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. THING BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES AN QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANNA CABALLERO. VERY QUICKLY I'M I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I JUST A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WOULD BE ANY RESTRICTION ON THE UTILIZATION OF AN EIGHTY UNIT FOR RENTAL PER FOR FOR SHORT TERM RENTAL PURPOSES. NO NOT IN THE HERE WE'RE LEAVING THAT UP TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THEY'RE ALL OVER THE BOARD OF WHAT THEY WANT LIMóN IT DOESN'T [inaudible] I'M AGNOSTIC. YEAH I GUESS I WANT TO URGE YOU NOT TO BE AGNOSTIC ON THIS -- ONE IF WE'RE GONNA COUNTED AS PART OF OUR RENEWED NUMBERS AND I THINK IT SHOULD FRANKLY -- I THINK IT IT SHOULD BE RESTRICTED BUT THAT'S JUST MY TWO CENTS WORK THE NIGHT I PUT THAT IN THERE. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES SENATOR SKINNER -- I JUST NOTE THAT THE A. P. A.'S PART OF THEIR OPPOSITION WAS THE FACT THAT. PEOPLE THAT ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD HAVE TO ONCE AGAIN REVISED THEIR AID YOU ORDINANCES HAD WE BEEN SUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR AS WE HAD ATTEMPTED. TO THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN REVISING THEIR ORDINANCES AT THE SAME TIME AND ALL TOGETHER. SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT. THE BILLS -- GOT HUNG UP LAST YEAR BUT I THINK THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF IT'S MUCH EASIER [inaudible] TO GIVEN THAT WE HAVE EXISTING RESIDENTIAL UNITS. AN EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. TO ADD ANOTHER RESIDENTIAL UNIT IS MUCH EASIER THAN STARTING AGAIN. WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION WHETHER IT'S THROUGH ANY OF OUR OTHER. BILLS THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO THOSE BUT THEY IT'S GOING TO TAKE MUCH LONGER. SO IN TERMS OF THIS HOUSING CRISIS THIS IS VERY NEEDED BUT I DO SEE HERE DISCOVER YEARS CONCERNING THAT I WANT THESE ADDITIONAL UNITS TO COUNT TOWARDS ARENA. I WANT THEM NOT TO BE. SHORT TERM. AND I ALSO THINK. THE WHILE. REQUIRING OWNER OCCUPANCY IS TOO ONEROUS I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT MINIMIZES THE SPECULATIVE VALUE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A MOTIVATION. FOR THESE -- HOUSING CORPORATIONS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE A COUPLE CORPORATION STEP BOUGHT UP SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES -- AND THEN OUR RAINING IN THE MET QUITE HIGH PRICES AND SO. SOME LEVEL YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S A RESTRICTION ON OF A YOU KNOW LARGE LARGER CORPORATE OWNERS% BUT ANYWAY OTHER NAT I THINK IT'S A GREAT DEAL. CAN I MOVE IT. OKAY WITH MOTION -- I I WILL SAY I'M. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR TAKING HIM INSIDE AMERICAN MONEY AND I ON THE SIDE LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR A JOINT AUTHORED WHATEVER YOU WOULD. ADD ME AS STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. I WANTED TO SAY THERE ARE AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN HOUSING -- POLICY AND POLITICS FOR A LONG TIME THERE ARE -- A LOT A LOT OF ASPECTS OF HOUSING POLICY POLITICS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE UPSETTING TO ME IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF MAKING IT HARD TO CREATE HOUSING AND HAVING CHILDREN SLEEPING IN CARS AND YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T MOVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY GREW UP IN. A VERY TOUGH SITUATION THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT REALLY BUG ME MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE ALLOWED CITIES TO DO IN TERMS OF FEEDING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. TO ALLOW. YOU TO USE IT WAS I AM THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PASSED A LAW THEY SAID YOU HAVE TO LET PEOPLE PUT EIGHTY USE. IN THEIR HOMES PERIOD. AND FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS CITIES IN THE STATE INCLUDING BY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE FLOUTED THAT LAW. NOR TO HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW. AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HOUSING SHORTAGE WE HAVE THE EFFICIENCY OF PUTTING IN LAW UNITS AND NOW YOU'RE NOT. YOU KNOW GETTING INTO HIGH IMBOLC ISSUES THAT PEOPLE SOMETIMES ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT. AND YET WE HAVE ALLOWED CITIES INCLUDING MY OWN TO OBEY THE LAW -- I WANTED HIM TO IN TERMS OF THE EPA'S COMMENT THAT WHILE GOD THEIR CHANGES EVERY SINGLE YEAR WEATHER CHANGES EVERY YEAR BECAUSE THIS IS TURNED INTO A CAT AND MOUSE GAME. WERE IN THE LEGISLATURE SAYS YOU HAVE TO ALLOW EIGHTY USE AND THEN NOT ALL BUT A LOT OF CITIES FIND WAYS TO MAKE IT TOO EXPENSIVE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY PUT THE VIEWS AND SEVEN SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HERE CENTER SKINNER CENTER TANGER CENTER OR SOMETHING THEM BLOOM -- HAS TO LIKE STEP IN WITH TO PASS ANOTHER LAW TO CLUES CLOSE MORE LOOPHOLES AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER LOOPHOLE SO THAT'S THE REASON IT'S DOCTOR GRATUITOUSLY WHICH IS DECIDING TO PASS NEW LAWS FOR EIGHTY USE EVERY YEAR. IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE SERIOUS WHEN WE SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO LET YOU USE -- GO IN -- AND UNTIL THIS CAT AND MOUSE GAME ENDS THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE -- LAWS AND THE IMPACT THE SOME SENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO RELY ON IMPACT FEES -- BUT WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT THESE SOME OF THESE FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR OR MORE IMPACT FEES BEING PUT ON EIGHTY YOU -- IT'S IT'S JUST NOT IT'S NOT REASONABLE AND SO UNFORTUNATELY A COP. IS I THINK REQUIRED -- AND AND SO ON I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR A BRING IT FORWARD -- AND IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS -- AND WE HAVE A MOTION WILL CALL THE ROLL -- I'M SORRY. THE ONLY PLEASE CLOSE THE STRUCTURE ALL USER COMMENTS OKAY. THANK YOU. FIVE THAT DUMB. THE SENATE BILL THIRTEEN BY SENATOR WITH CASKEY THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE SENATOR WIENER. YES AS FIVE WIENER HI MORRELL. BATES. BATES I COVER. COVER I DRAWS -- MCGUIRE MORLOCK MORE LIKE I ROTH. ROTH AYE SKINNER. I NUMBER. NUMBER FIVE A CASKEY. CASSIE I IT HAS ENOUGH BOTH SPOKE OF THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU CENTER. OKAY -- WILL NOW GO TO CENTER SKINNER -- ITEM NUMBER SIX SB EIGHTEEN THANKS SO MUCH MISTER TURN MEMBERS SB EIGHTEEN THE PURPOSE OF THE BILLS TO RECOGNIZE THAT. IN THIS HOUSING CRISIS THE CALIFORNIA HAS WITH HOUSING COSTS SKYROCKETING AND UNFORTUNATELY WELL WE'VE INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE -- WAGES HAVE MORE OR LESS STAYED STAGNANT -- YOU'VE GOT MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE. REALLY COMPROMISED WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO MEET THEIR RENT. AND ARE JUST A FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR UNEXPECTED EXPENSE AWAY FROM HOMELESSNESS. HOMELESS POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA ROSE BY 16% FROM. TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE ON OUR IN OUR MANY OF ARCHIMEDES DO THESE REAL TIME COUNTS AND COLLECT A LOT OF DATA AROUND ARE HOMELESS. IN THAT. THAT INCREASE THE MAJORITY OF THEM. WERE NEWLY HOMELESS NEVER BEEN HOMES BEFORE. HAD JOBS. AND MANY OF THEM HAVE JOBS NOT HAD HALF HAVE JOBS. AND MANY OF THEM HAVE CHILDREN. SO THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL OR ADDICTED THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT JUST. FROM. BECAUSE THEY WERE PAYING MORE THAN 50% POTENTIALLY. OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT. FACE TO DIFFICULTY MANY OF THEM WERE NOT EVEN AFFECTED STATE LEFT THEIR PLACE BEFORE BEING AFFECTED. BECAUSE TO HAVE AN EVICTION ON YOUR RECORD ALMOST MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RENT AGAIN. SO USE MANY TENANTS WILL LEAVE. BEFORE THEIR AFFECTED AS SOON AS THEY'RE ENOUGH LATE IN THEIR RENT ENOUGH MONTHS. SO WHAT SB EIGHTEEN WILL DO IS INCREASE [inaudible] CALIFORNIA'S FIND WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUND NOW. SO IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL OWN APPROPRIATION WILL INCREASE THAT FUND SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. MORE EMERGENCY OR RATHER WE CAN PROVIDE EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO MORE TENANTS. THIS IS PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AND ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD INCREASE THE LEGAL FUNDS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE SOME LEGAL ASSISTANCE. BECAUSE IN SOME CASES THE TENANTS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE AND WE CAN AVOID WE CAN KEEP THEM IN THEIR HOME JUST WITH SOME LEVEL OF LEGAL ASSISTANCE. BUT MY PRIORITY FOCUSES ON THE EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE. AND ADDITIONALLY IT HAS SOME OTHER COMPONENTS BUT I WILL ALLOW MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO SPEAK WE HAVE KEREN ERICKSON FROM CATHOLIC CHARITIES WHO IS PART OF A PROGRAM IN MY DISTRICT THAT IS RUNNING. AN EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND ALSO ALEXANDER HARDEN FROM THE WESTERN CENTER LAN PARTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- FOR HAVING ME COME AND SPEAK AND I'M I'M. HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL OF SENATOR SCANNERS -- I WORK FOR CATHOLIC CHARITIES AT THE EAST BAY AND WE'VE BEEN PART OF A PARTNERSHIP FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS CALLED KEEP OAKLAND HOUSED. PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN US BAY AREA COMMUNITY SERVICES AND EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER. AND OUR PURPOSE IS HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION. SO THERE'S SO MANY AND AND YOU CAN SPEND ALL AFTERNOON HEARING ABOUT. INTERVENTIONS IN HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS -- AND WE JUST WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT PREVENTION IS ANOTHER PIECE THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO FIND -- PREVENTION IS THE LEAST COSTLY AND THE MOST HUMANE. SO BASICALLY IT'S AN ENABLES US TO USE CASE MANAGEMENT EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOUSING. SO NOT ONLY ARE PEOPLE AND FAMILIES NOT BECOMING HOMELESS WE'RE NOT LOSING THE UNITS. ISN'T WHICH IS A REALLY HUGE -- PROBLEM BECAUSE THEN WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GO -- IN THE SIX MONTHS THAT WE'VE BEEN. OPERATING WE'VE SERVED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE HOUSEHOLDS WITH AN AVERAGE OF LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH -- AND THAT JUST SHOWS HOW -- AFFECTED IT CAN BE IN TERMS OF IN COMPARISON -- TO IF YOU WERE TRYING TO BUILD. THAT MUCH HOUSING -- ACTUALLY FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY HOUSEHOLDS -- YOU WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO BUILD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY UNITS. SO IT'S ABOUT FIVE TIMES AS EFFECTIVE -- WE JUST REALLY BELIEVE IN AND GETTING GETTING UPSTREAM WITH THIS PROBLEM NOT NOT REPLACING BUILDING HOUSING BUT ADDING TO WHAT I COLOR TOOL BOX SO THAT WE HAVE A LOT MORE TOOLS. IN OUR HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING TERM MEMBERS I'M ALEXANDER HER NAME WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PLEASED TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT SB -- EIGHTEEN THIS BILL CONTAINS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT INTERVENTIONS TO PROVIDE STABILITY TO STRUGGLING RENTERS AND A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTEDHOUSING COSTS -- THE FIRST OF THE BILL EXTENDS IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS LIVING IN FOR CLOSE PROPERTIES WHICH WILL OTHERWISE EXPIRE THIS YEAR -- AND WHICH SHIELD INNOCENT TENANTS FROM ARBITRARY AFFECTIONS AFTER FORECLOSURE -- WELL. NOT AFFECTING EVICTIONS BASED ON TENANT FAULT FOR REASONS SUCH AS NON PAYMENT OF RENT OR VIOLATION OF THE LEASE -- IN ADDITION THE BILL PROVIDES NEEDED. RENTAL ASSISTANCE EDUCATION AND LEGAL SERVICES FOR TENANTS AT RISK OF DISPLACEMENT. ACROSS THE STATE WE KNOW OVER HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S TENANTS ARE RENT BURDEN -- WITH ALMOST ONE THIRD LIVING WITH EXTREME RENT BIRD AND MEANING THEY'RE PAYING OVER HALF OF THEIR INCOME JUST FOR HOUSING -- AS WE WORK TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF RISING RENTS AND HOUSING SUPPLY. NEAR TERM INTERVENTIONS LIKE RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND LEGAL RESOURCES ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO MAKING SURE THAT TENANTS AT RISK OF DISPLACEMENT AREN'T FORCED. PREDICTABLY INTO HOMELESSNESS AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S A SIMPLE COMMON. CASEY LAID ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF OAKLAND SANTA ANA BERKELEY IN EMERYVILLE ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU FOR SPEAKER.

THE BILL TODAY SANDY GEORGE REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. OKAY SEE NINE OPPOSITION. TONY BE WITH THE A CALIFORNIA PERMANENT SOLUTION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE SENATOR. AND THE CENTERS OFFICE AND WE FEELCONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO REMOVE OPPOSITION SOON. THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS OPPOSITION. A GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF CREAM THREE CM BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IS INTRODUCED WE DID HAVE AN OPPOSING WAS AMENDED POSITION ON SB -- EIGHTEEN BUT WITH THE MARCH TWENTY FIFTH THE MOMENTS WE HAVE MOVED TO A NEUTRAL POSITION SO JUST ANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK THE AUTHOR. AND HER STAFF -- FOR WORKING TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WE GREATLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. CASEY NONE WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND TO MOVE BY CENTER OFF A CENTER WHAT CAL SKI. SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ON THE THE SUNSET PROVISION IN NINETY DAYS. FORECLOSURE SAID NINETY DAY PERIOD WHEN IS THE NOTICE OF WHEN DO YOU WHEN HAS TO NOTICE BEEN DONE IN THE PROGRAM IS IT ON DAY. ONE OR DAY. NINETY WHEN THAT WHEN THAT LAND WHEN THE OWNER OF THE HOME GIVES NOTICE TO THE TENANTS THEY JUST NEED TO GIVE A NINETY DAY. AFFECTION NOTICE IT SO. IF YOU ARE EVICTING AS A RESULT OF FORECLOSURE. YOU NEED TO GIVE THE TENANT NINETY DAYS NOTICE THAT WAS UNDER THE THE ORIGINAL FORECLOSURE BILLS WERE GONNA JUST REMOVE THAT SUNSET SO THAT CONTINUES. BUT ON THE PROBLEM -- THERE WAS CONCERN. EXPRESSED THAT. THE WHAT IF THE TENANT JUST DECIDES TO GET A NINETY DAY NOTICE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE AFFECTED IN NINETY DAYS SO THEY JUST STOP PAYING RENT. IF THEY JUST STOP PAYING RENT THE LANDLORD CAN PROVIDE A THREE DAY NOTICE THE EVICTION PROCESS CAN START IF THE TENANT HAS NOT PAID RENT. RIGHT SO THE NOTICING OF NINETY DAYS DOES NOT ABSOLVE THE TENANT OF THE RENT OBLIGATION. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS -- EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS IN THE THE CATHOLICS ALWAYS WANT TO HELP OUT WHENEVER THEY CAN -- THE THE AND THEN FORECLOSURE PROCESS YOU KNOW THE LANDLORD OR THE HOMEOWNER HASN'T PAID THE MORTGAGE HAS FAULTED UNDERGO THE I'M WONDERING IF THEY'VE DEFAULTED THEY GET THE NOTICE FROM THE BANK. IS THE IS THE POINT OF IS THE DESIRE THAT OKAY YEAR IN NINETY DAYS IF NINETY DAYS YOU THE LAND OR THE HOMEOWNER HAVE NINETY DAYS TO CURE IF YOU GIVE NOTICE TO THE TEN AND THAT I'M UNDER FORECLOSURE HAS BEEN COMPLETED YET. BUT IT'S GOING DOES DO YOU ANTICIPATE YOUR PROGRAM THE EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS THE COME AND SAY -- WITH THIS PERSON COULD LOSE THE HOUSE WE'LL QUEUE -- THE DEFAULT IN THE TEN IT CONTINUES TO PAY OR THIS IS IT'S FOR CLOSE THE SALE HAS OCCURRED AND TENANTS JUST THERE IS. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE HOMEOWNER. ANY MONEY TO AVOID THEIR FOR CLOSURE THAT MAY BE A LEGITIMATE POLICY CONSIDERATION BUT THAT IS NOT IN THIS BILL. THIS BILL THAT [inaudible] PORTION OF REMOVING THE SUNSET FOR THE NINETY DAY NOTICE. REGARDING AFFECTION UNDER FORECLOSURE IS A SEPARATE PROVISION OF THE BILL. AND THEN THERE IS THE DISTINCT PROVISION FOR EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE BUT EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED TO THE MORTGAGE HOLDER THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES CENTER CABALLERO. LIKE I JUST HAVE A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE FINDS IT WOULD COME FROM THIS C. S. H.. AND THE IT LOOKS LIKE THE RECOMMENDATION IS THEY GO TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. AND I'VE I'VE HAD SOME CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN MY COUNTIES AROUND -- THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN SOME OF THE SOME OF THE COMMUNITY OF KERR'S SO I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE ALSO TOOK THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE HOMELESS MONEY. AND AND I'M I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH THIS ACTUALLY SETTING GOALS SO THAT WE HAVE A WAY TO KNOW WHETHER THE MONEY IS REALLY GOING TO WHAT WE WANTED TO GO TO SO I I RAISE THAT I I AM GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT MORE IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE I'M I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT. BUDGET AMID CONCERN WHAT WE DID SO FAR IN THE BILL WAS RECOGNIZE THAT EACH CD DOES HAVE AN EXISTING. EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. WHICH WAS AUGMENTED. LAST YEAR WITH THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION SO WE MADE A CONSISTENT BUT WE DO SHARE A CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER IT SHOULD BE BROADER THAN JUST THE CONTINUINGCARE AND AS WE MOVE THE BILL THROUGH. WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY SING NOW WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR ROTH AND THE AND I AM RECOMMENDING AND AYE VOTES. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. CLOSE [inaudible] FOR CALDERON. THIS IS SENATE BILL EIGHTEEN BY SENATOR SKINNER THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY SENATOR WIENER AYE. WIENER AYE MORRELL [inaudible] BATES [inaudible] CAMARO. CAMARO I DRAWS -- MCGUIRE. MORE LUCK. ROUGH. ROTH AYE SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE AMBERG. NUMBER I CASKEY. CASKEY AYE. OKAY THAT IS SIX BOTH WHICH IS ENOUGH BUT WE'LL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS WILL NOW GO TO OUR SECOND THE LAST ITEM -- ITEM -- THIRTEEN BUT SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR BY CENTER CABALLERO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AS WE ALL KNOW WHEN WE'VE HEARD IT VER AND OVER TODAY CALIFORNIA FACES A DOUBLE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS AND A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THE RESULTING BURDEN FALLS PARTICULARLY HARD ON PEOPLE LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. NEARLY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ARE HOMELESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE LIVING WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS. IN MONTEREY COUNTY ARE BY ANY ACCOUNT FOUND HOMELESSNESS GREW AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN TEN YEARS. WE KNOW THE PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS MENTAL ILLNESS LIVING ON SHELTERED OR CYCLING IN AND OUT OF HOSPITALS IN AN INCARCERATION IS COSTLY TO THE PUBLIC. AND RESULT IN NEEDLESS SUFFERING RESEARCHING COMMON SENSE TELLS US THAT PROVIDING HOUSING WITH SUPPORT SERVICES IS AFFECTED IN AND ENDING HOMELESSNESS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT LAST FALL VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED PROPOSITION TWO THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME INITIATIVE WHICH AUTHORIZED THE STATE TO ISSUE TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS TO CREATE TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. FOR HOMELESS MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SUCH HOUSING KEEP PEOPLE INSIDE REDUCES ILLNESS AND SUFFERING AND LOWERS PUBLIC COSTS. SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR HELPS FULFILL THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS BY CLARIFYING AND STREAMLINING THE LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES LIKE THOSE THAT NO PLACE LIKE HOME BONDS ARE FUNDING. SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR UTILIZES A STREAMLINING APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECT ENVISIONED IN LAST YEAR'S. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO AND APPLIES THIS PROCESS TO THE PROPOSITION TWO NO PLACE LIKE HOME SUPPORT OF HOUSING THE BILL EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND INCLUDES A BY ITS USE BY RIGHT IN STONE FOR MULTI FAMILY AND MIXED USE ARE PERMITTED. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL PROVIDES THAT APPROVAL OF A PROJECT SUBJECT TO STREAMLINE REVIEW SHALL NON NOT CONSTITUTE A PROJECT FOR PURPOSES OF SEAQUEST NOR DOES THE DECISION BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO SEEK NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDS -- ALSO A BET SUBJECT IT TO SEE WHAT. FINALLY ANY SECRET CHALLENGE SHALL BE RESOLVED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION WITHIN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS. THUS EXPEDITING THE PROCESS CALIFORNIA VOTERS MADE IT CLEAR THEY WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND HAVE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS TO BE SHELTERED AND CARE. FOR OPPOSITION TO GOT MORE VOTES THAN ANY OTHER MEASURE ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BELIEVE ME IN THE SENATORS -- ADRIN SULTAN WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR SENATE BILL -- SEVEN FOUR FOUR CALIFORNIA DOES FACE AN IMMENSE HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. AND WITH UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS LIVING ON OUR STREET ANY GIVEN NIGHT A THIRD OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS MORE HAS TO BE DONE. AND SENATE BILL SEVEN FOUR FOUR WILL STREAMLINE THE STUDY PROCESS FOR THE TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS THAT WAS PROMISED BY NO PLACE LIKE HOME. IT'S TIME TO TAKE ON CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS YOU AND BREAK THE CYCLE OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AND SB SEVEN FOUR FOUR PROVIDES ARE HOMELESS LIVING WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS WITH THE PLAN. AND FUNDING TO EXIT FROM THE STREETS THAT WE BELIEVE THIS IS A HUMANE AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO ENDING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. AND SB SEVEN FOUR FOUR POINTS ARE HOMELESS TOWARD A PATHWAY OF RECOVERY AND WELL BEING LAST YEAR I VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING CHAIR MEMBERS OF CHRIS PUT YOUR THOMAS LAW GROUP I'M HERE IF THE COMMITTEE AS ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OF PUBLIC COMMENT. DELTA DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIAN WERE SUPPORT -- AS YOU KNOW -- HAS BEEN REPEATED THROUGHOUT THE DAY TODAY THAT WE ARE. IN THE MIDST OF AN EXTRAORDINARY HOUSING CRISIS AND NO ONE REALLY OF IS IMPACTED BY THAT AS MUCH AS THE PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. SO AS YOU'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY HERE FROM US MANY TIMES -- THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WHO ARE LEFT ON THE STREETS -- OFTEN ARE SUBJECT TO MORE RESTRICTIVE -- OPTIONS THAT ARE MADE BY -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO WE THINK THIS IS -- AN IMPORTANT TO MEASURE TO GET THE DOLLARS OUT -- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE -- ONE OTHER PIECE THAT WE WOULD KNOW IT -- AS ARE A FRIENDS IN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE DO -- HAVE CONCERNS WHEN THERE ARE CALENDAR PREFERENCES -- FOR SYKORA -- BECAUSE THAT THEN MOVES OTHERS TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE IN IN LITIGATION AND THOSE OF US THAT HAVE DIFFERENT CASES IN LITIGATION WANT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE CASES CAN MOVE AS QUICKLY AS OTHERS THANK YOU. TWENTY BILLION WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT SORRY FOR THE LATE SUPPORT LETTER [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. SEE NOT OPPOSITION [inaudible] FOR GOOD EVENING TURN MEMBERS TEN PLAN FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THE DISTRICT COUNCILS OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT ONLY THE EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW PROVISIONS -- THAT WERE JUST REFERENCED IF THE PROVISION WERE REMOVED FROM THE BILL THE COUNCIL WOULD READ WITHDRAW ITS OPPOSITION IS ALL OF THE REMAINING ISSUES IN THE BILL. OR OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL'S PURVIEW JUST AS A PRELIMINARY MATTER. IT'S UNCLEAR WHY THE EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW PROVISION IS STILL INCLUDED IN THE MEASURE SINCE THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL AS THE AUTHOR INDICATED. MAKE SUCH PROJECTS USED BY RIGHT AN EXEMPT FROM SEA QUEST SO WE'RE JUST. KIND OF PUZZLED OF WHY YOU WOULD NEED TO MAINTAIN THE EXTRA JUDICIAL REVIEW PROVISIONS IN LIGHT OF THE LATEST AMENDMENTS. THAT BEING SAID AS WITH THE OTHER PENDING BILLS THAT CONTAIN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW REQUIREMENTS. THE COUNCIL'S OPPOSITION IS LIMITED TO THE COURT IMPACTS OF SUCH LEGISLATION AND IT SIGNIFICANT INTERFERENCE WITH THE COURTS FUNDAMENTAL DUTY TO BRIGHT X. EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE. IN ALL OTHER CASES ON THE COURT'S DOCKET SO THESE OLDER CALENDAR PREFERENCES HAVE THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF PUSHING ALL OTHER CASES ON THE COURT'S DOCKETS TO THE BACK OF THE LINE. EVEN CASES THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY PRIORITIZED -- ESSENTIALLY THE THIS TYPE APPROACH PICKS WINNERS AND LOSERS EVEN AMONG CASES INVOLVING HOUSING RIGHTS THAT FALL WITHIN THIS COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION. JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. IF A HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS ACTION FOR IMPROPER FOR CLOSURE IS BROUGHT OR AN INSURANCE BAD FAITH CASE. OR OTHER CLAIMS BROUGHT BY HOMEOWNERS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE RECENT DEVASTATING FIRES. IN SANTA ROSA -- THE MUD SLIDES IN SANTA BARBARA THOSE CASES WILL TAKE LONGER TO DECIDE IF A HOUSING DISCRIMINATION OR EIGHTY A LAWSUIT IS BROUGHT BY PEOPLE WITH MENTAL AND OTHER DISABILITIES IN FACT THERE'S A ARTICLE IN TODAY'S LA TIMES ABOUT. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT GOING AFTER LA FOR NOT INSURING THAT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. IN LA ARE NOT DISCRIMINATING UNLAWFULLY AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES SO EVEN IF THOSE KINDS OF LITIGATION WERE BROUGHT THOSE AGAIN MOVED TO THE BACK OF THE LINE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ULTRA CALENDAR PREFERENCE. JUST A COUPLE OF NON HOUSING RELATED CASES. FOR EXAMPLE A PERSONAL INJURY ACTION INVOLVING A SEVERELY BRAIN DAMAGED CHILD THOSE DO NOT GET THE SUPER X.. WE DO ELDER ABUSE LITIGATION INVOLVING DYING PLAINTIFFS CIVIL ACTIONS INVOLVING HUMAN TRAFFICKING WAGE THEFT. THESE AND OTHER IMPORTANT CASES ON THE COURT DOCKETS WILL ALL TAKE LONGER. TO DECIDE SYNDICATE EARLIER WERE NOT JUST CLEAR AT ALL AND WHY YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN THIS EXTRA JUDICIAL REVIEW IN THE FACE OF THE USE BY RIGHT. AND SECRET EXEMPTION. FINALLY THE THE ASSUMPTION THAT UNDERLIES THE EXTRA. JUDICIAL REVIEW AS WE UNDERSTAND IT IS THAT THE DEVELOPERS AND FIND ANSWERS INDICATE THATTHEY NEED THE CERTAINTY THAT WOULD COME WITH A THE QUICK TURNAROUND TIME THAT HAS BEEN IMPOSED ON THE COURTS. WE'RE HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IN THE REAL WORLD THAT DOES THAT CERTAINTY DOES NOT EXIST IN THE TWO CASES THAT BEEN LITIGATED TO DATE UNDER A. B.. NINE HUNDRED THEY WERE BOTH SEE QUIRK AND NON SEQUEL CAUSES OF ACTION LAWSUITS FILED FOR THE SEQUEL COULD. LITIGATION PERVERSELY GOES ON THE SUPER ACCELERATED TRACK BUT THE NON SEQUEL CAUSES OF ACTION ANOTHER LAWSUIT PROCEED NORMALLY. IN FACT THE MOST RECENT CASE EIGHTY ONE FIFTY SUNSET BOULEVARD PROJECT IN LA HAD FOUR SEPARATE LAWSUITS. FILED BY FOUR SEPARATE GROUPS THE PLAINEST NOT COORDINATED IN ANY FASHION. THEY HAD SECRET AND NON SEQUEL CAUSES OF ACTION THE SEQUEL LITIGATION WAS ALL CONSOLIDATED MOVED ON A FAST TRACK. THE BAR FOR CATERED OFF THE NON SEQUEL CAUSES OF ACTION IN EVEN AFTER ALL OF THE SEQUEL LITIGATION PATHWAY WAS CLEARED. THE REMAINING LITIGATION IS STILL PENDING IN THE LA SUPERIOR COURT AND THE LOCAL PLANNING COMMISSION HISTORICAL COMMISSION HAS NOT SIGNED OFF. ON THE PROPOSED DEMOLITION OF THIS BEAUTIFUL MID CENTURY BNK BUILDING THAT HAPPENS TO BE ON THE SITE. THAT IS PROPOSED FOR THIS PROJECT SO THAT THE CERTAINTY WE WOULD SUBMIT RESPECTFULLY. THAT UNDERLIES THE WHOLE ASSUMPTION FOR THESE EXTRA JUDICIAL YOU SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST IN THE REAL WORLD. FOR THOSE CASES THAT GET SUED WHEN THEY'RE IT'S REALLY CONTENT TO LITIGATION AND PEOPLE ARE WELL RESOURCE IN ORDER TO DO THAT THEY WILL. BRING ALL CAUSES OF ACTION SEQUEL AND NON SEQUEL. AND THAT WE RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT THAT JUST AS FUNDAMENTALLY AT ODDS WITH OUR COURT SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO OPERATE IN ITS FOR THOSE REASONS THAT WE ARE IN OPPOSITION AND AGAIN. IF THAT PROVISION WILL REMOVED WE WOULD WITHDRAW OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. BRENNAN DAWSON I'LL BE OF THE SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA WE WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS IS A REALLY TO SEE COLLUDED CATION TO WITH OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- ADDITIONALLY WE WANT TO ADD THAT -- MOST OF THE HOUSING PROJECTS AS RELATES TO DISABILITY CATION -- ACTUALLY ONLY NEED -- HI THERE I ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS OR NAKED NECK DACHSHUNDS A NEGATIVE -- DECORATIONS THEREFORE THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE TO GO TO THE C. COLOURATION PROCESS -- BUT EVEN THEN WE WOULD ACTUALLY ASKED THAT THE AUTHOR REMOVED THE SECRET EXEMPTION ALTOGETHER -- PORTING THE SICKLE PROCESS IN OUR VIEW -- SEVERELY LIMITS A COMMUNITY'S ABILITY TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITY AS IT RELATES TO HOW MUCH POLLUTION EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE -- HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN -- WHEN CONSTRUCTION OCCURS AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THANK YOU CARD FOR LONDON AND DID YOU SAY THAT THE I. R. AS IN NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE C. COMPRESSIBLE MANY BOOKS SO BECAUSE BECAUSE MANY? BECAUSE MANY -- HOUSING PROJECTS ONLY HAVE TO DO YEAH I OURS OR NAY THEY HAVE NEGATIVE DECORATIONS THE ACTUALLY JUST REVIEW IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THOSE POSIT JONES PRODUCTS. ARE PROJECTS SORRY THOSE PRODUCTS USUALLY DON'T TAKE AS LONG AS IT WOULD TAKE TO GO TO THE COURT SYSTEM. BIGGER BIGGER THROUGH THE AUTO OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR THANKS BIGGER. AARON RIGHT BURKE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION ALIGNING OUR COMMENTS WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND AGAIN IF THE EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE BUILDING WE WOULD HAVE NO. POSITION ON THE BILL THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. IT WILL BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE HOW CAN I SUCCESS OPPONENTS TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUE OF WHY THE ACCIDENT A REVIEW IS AN AND THE BILL. NUMBER PATELLAR CODE. SURE THANK YOU -- I'M A FIRST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE LANGUAGE IN PUBLIC RESOURCE CODE TWO ONE ONE SIX THREE POINT FIVE AS PROPOSED WOULD SAY TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE IT'S NOT A MANDATE ON THE COURT IT'S A IT'S AN ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THEY DO IT IF IT IS POSSIBLE. I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION -- SECONDLY THAT AS I'M SURE ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE THERE ARE MULTIPLE OR NUMEROUS LAWSUITS EVERY YEAR AGAINST EXEMPTIONS. SO HAVING EX BUT I REVIEW FOR PROJECT IS EXEMPT FROM SEQUEL IS STILL HELPFUL TO GET IT THROUGH THE LITIGATION PROCESS. IN ADDITION NOT ALL -- SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS. ARE COVERED BY THE BY RIGHT PROVISIONS IF IT WAS. REQUIRED TO REZONE TO ALLOW FOR HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE WHICH THERE ARE SOME JURISDICTIONS A MAY BE INCLINED TO DO THAT PROJECT MAY VERY WELL STILL REQUIRE ANY AYE ARE. AND COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE STREAMLINED LITIGATION PROCESS -- IN ADDITION I WAS ONE OF THE COUNCILS AND THE WORKERS ARENA CASE AND WHILE THEY WERE ABLE TO GET DOWN INTO AND SEVEN DAYS THEY WERE VERY CLOSE SO I CAN SAY FROM MY EXPERIENCE. IT WAS AN EFFECTIVE PROCESS. FINN ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WILL MAKE THIS VERY LONG BUT I JUST HAVE SOME QUESTIONS OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL I MEAN CERTAINLY THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE ALLOWS. IN FACT REQUIRES SOME. PRIORITY IN TERMS OF LITIGATION DOES IT NOT IT IT DOES IN FACT SEQUEL CASES ARE ALREADY ENTITLED O'FALLON BUT FRIENDS BUT NOT FORGET SINGLE TO RICK CELEBRATED FORGET SEQUEL WHAT ELSE? AND UNLAWFUL DETAINER. OLD PEOPLE WHO ELSE KATE CASES WHERE PEOPLE AS YOU INDICATED AND IN DANGER OF OF DYING CERTAIN ELECTION MATTERS THAT AFFECT STATEWIDE ELECTIONS THAT KIND OF THING SO SO OVERSEE SORT OF TIRED WITH THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT TAKES FOR THIS PROCESS TO OCCUR. WE DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THE PROCESS WE DON'T WANT TO CUT ANY SHORT WE'VE GOT A COUPLE. HAVE SHORT CUTS BUT WE WANT THE STUFF DECIDED AND WE WANT IT DECIDED QUICKLY. AND SINCE WE FIND YOU. WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT YOU REQUIRE IN ORDER TO HAVE EXPEDITED SEQUEL LITIGATION IF YOU SAY YOU CAN'T DO IT AND IT'S KIND OF FEAR INTERFERE WITH OTHER CASES IN THE? IN THE TWO CASES THAT BEEN LITIGATED UNDER A. B.. NINE HUNDRED FROM THE FROM THE INFORMATION THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AVAILABLE THE THE TO THE TWO ATTORNEYS IN THE WARRIORS CASE RATHER THAN THE ONE SUPPORTING THE JUDGE -- THEY WERE ALL WORKING NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS AND THE REST OF THE CASES ON THEIR DOCKET. GOT SHORT SHRIFT THEY HAD TO WAIT LONGER IN ORDER TO BE DECIDED. IN THE IN THE LITIGATION DOWN SOUTH. SIMILAR THE THE JUDGE AND THE SUPPORT STAFF THAT WAS REQUIRED TO HANDLE THAT CASE WAS EXTRAORDINARY IN NATURE AND THAT MEANS THAT ALL THE OTHER CASES ON THEIR DOCKET TOOK LONGER TO DECIDE WELL COURSE THOSE ARE TWO THAT SOUNDS LIKE THOSE ARE. TWO ONE USUAL CASES CERTAINLY THE WARRIOR CASES UNUSUAL AND THAT DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION WHAT WOULD YOU IS A JUDICIAL COUNCIL REQUIRE IF WE WANT TO IMPOSE. SEQUENCE STREAMLINING WITH REGARD TO LITIGATION. CAN MORE JUDGES. TWENTY WELL ANY MILLION DOLLARS. THE DIFFICULTY WITH THAT IS THAT AND I KNOW YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU YOU'VE BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER IN TERMS OF GETTING US ADDITIONAL JUDGES. I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM ANY OF OUR JUDGES ARE THE SUPPORT STAFF THAT WE NEED MORE SECRET JUDGES ARE FUNDING SPECIFIC THE SEQUEL BECAUSE THE WE DON'T CONTROL. THAT DOCKET HOW OFTEN CASES GET FILED HOW MANY AND HOW COMPLEX THOSE CASES ARE WE CERTAINLY COULD BENEFIT. FROM HAVING MORE JUDICIAL OFFICERS AS YOU KNOW AND HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BUT THERE'S NOT TO MAGIC NUMBER THAT IF WE BECAUSE WE AGAIN WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE DOCKET WHICH CASES GET FILED. WELL I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR THIS TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SEPARATE CONVERSATION WITH YOU ON THE SUBJECT BECAUSE I FRANKLY BOTHERED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS POSITION IN THIS CASE. ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE. HOW WE CAN RESOLVE THAT IN THIS AND OTHER CASES WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO STREAMLINE THE SECRET PROCESS THANK YOU MISTER? CENTER LIKE HEALTHY.% CAN WE TURN OUR ATTENTION TO PAGE EIGHTEEN LINE TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MISTER POND HAS HIT THE ENTIRE NAIL ON THE HEAD. BECAUSE HE'S TALKING ABOUT CASES THAT WILL BE STREAMLINED FOR SEQUEL BUT IT SAYS AFTER NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROJECTS WITH THE GRANTING OF ANY APPROVAL FOR THAT PROJECT. SO WAS I READ THAT NOT ONLY IS IT IS SEEK WHAT CHALLENGE IT'S A IT'S ANY. POSSIBLE ACTION WOULD HAVE TO GET THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY SPA FAST TRACK FOR THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECT. THERE'S A NOR THERE OR THE GRANTING OF ANY APPROVAL SO ANY OF THE SUPPORT OF PROJECTS IN ANY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AT ANY TIME. ANY LAWSUIT FOR WHATEVER MATTER THAT GOES FOR THE APPROVAL GETS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAY. FASTRACK. THAT'S HOW I READ THAT. WHAT COULD YOU SAY THAT THE PAGE IN THE LINE AGAIN AGE EIGHTEEN LINE TWENTY FIVE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT IT STARTS UP THE INCLUSION THE RULES OF THE COURT TO BE AMENDED FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL? SHALL APPLY TO ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING AND IT GOES REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT FOR THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROJECT WHICH IS WHAT MR. TONE IS TALKING ABOUT FOR THE GRANTING OF ANY APPROVAL FOR THAT PROJECT. BUT EVERYTHING. ANY LAWSUIT I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WAR YEARS CITY STADIUM ANOTHER PROJECT ON THERE THIS IS. ANY LAWSUIT ON ANY THESE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ON ANY SUPPORTIVE HOUSING [inaudible] THAT'S BIG. AM I READING THIS WRONG. THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROJECTS FOR THE GRANTING OF ANY APPROVAL FOR THAT PROJECT NOT FOR THAT SEEK WHAT THAT PROJECT. IN A PLACE LIKE HOME PROJECT. WE GET TO TO ONE SEVENTY DAIS. I GOT A BIG PROBLEM WITH THAT. I MEAN IT THIS IS NOT JUST FAST A CHALLENGE AND SEEK WITH THIS IS ANY. ANY WAS LAWSUIT. THIS THIS THIS IS INTENDED AND AND THE WAY I READ IT IT'S IT'S IF YOUR USING NO PLACE LIKE HOME. PROJECT FUNDS. THAT -- HAT IS -- CONSISTENT. WITH THE GRANT. AND CONSISTENT WITH THE THE THE WAY THAT -- IT EXPEDITED WHICH IS THAT IT'S ALREADY BEEN SOWN FOR APARTMENT IT'S ALREADY BEEN SOWN IT FITS EVERYTHING IN THE CITY. THAT IT CAN'T BE IT CAN'T BE DENIED BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A PROJECT FOR THE MENTALLY ILL. AND WAITED WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO FILE A SEQUEL LAWSUIT HE GETS A EXPEDITED NO NO IT'S IT'S IT'S SAYING MORE THAT IT'S SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILE A SEQUEL LAWSUIT YOU CAN FILE ANY LAWSUIT. BECAUSE IT'S APPROVAL THAT YOU DON'T. FORGET SEQUEL. FORGETS TO QUIT SAYING IF YOU GO ONE OF THESE PROJECTS ARE GETTING BETTER ARE EXEMPT HERE IT'S IT'S IT'S FAST TRACK FOR EVERYTHING YOUR PROBLEMS A JUDICIAL COUNCIL JUST GOT MULTIPLIED BY. FIVE HUNDRED THAT'S THIS IS NOTHING I MEAN THAT'S WHAT HOW IT READS AS IT IS I GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT. THE THE GOAL OF THE GOAL OF THE LANGUAGE I BELIEVE WAS TO INSURE THAT THESE PROJECTS DEVELOP QUICKLY SO IF YOU AS WAS MENTIONED IF IF SOMEONE COULD pACTION HAVE A BIFURCATED INTO SEVERAL CASES. THAT DOESN'T ACHIEVE THE GOAL SO IF IF THE GOAL IS TO GET THESE IN A FAIRLY NARROW CLASS OF PROJECTS THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROJECTS TO THE PROP TO FUNDING -- APPROVED AND THROUGH LITIGATION QUICKLY AYE I DO THINK THAT THERE'S VALUE IN MAKING SURE THAT THE PROJECT THAT THE LITIGATION ISN'T SEPARATED INTO. MULTIPLE MATTERS AND THAT A COURT DOES HERE ALL OF THAT ONCE I I PERSONALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD TAKE THAT MUCH LONGER TO DEAL WITH A SEEK A LAWSUIT. IN ADDITION TO OTHER CLAIMS AS IS OFTEN DONE IN SECRET LITIGATION. YES SIR MY LOCK. MICHELLE TO COULD YOU -- HELP ME OUT HERE A LITTLE BIT JUST TAKE IT INTO LAYMAN'S TERMS THE COUNTY. FILE SO GRANT. FOR THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDING. WITH THAT GRANT INCLUDE THE SPECIFIC REAL ESTATE AND THE PROJECT AND BE VERY CLEAR. AND AND THEREFORE HOPEFULLY A LOT OF THE APPROVAL. PROCESS IS ALREADY BEEN. TAKING CARE OF SO I'M I'M I'M WONDERING. IF THIS SEQUEL LAWSUIT COME OUT OF NO WHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YES. SO WE'RE ALL MOVING ALONG WITH FOUND THE PROPERTY WERE. FOR HAPPY WITH BUILDING A FACILITY FOR MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS PEOPLE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN. A SERVICE FOR LAWSUIT SHOW UP. AND YOU'RE SAYING. SPEEDED UP GET IT DONE AND THAT'S THAT'S THE GIST OF THIS BILL. OKAY THANK YOU I ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OKAY -- MIGHT. HA. HA MY OUR RECOMMENDATION IS AN ALLY ON THIS BILL -- YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE ISSUES ARE WITH EXPEDITED REVIEW. PERHAPS YOU AND CENTER OFF CAN FIGURE IT ALL OUT AND WE CAN FIX IT -- BY I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO GRANT EXPEDITED SEQUEL LAWSUITS TO SPORTS ARENAS WE SHOULD RUN AT THE HOMELESS PEOPLE. TO AND I THINK WE HEAR THIS -- ACTUALLY ALIVE A LOT OF I THINK VARIOUS AREAS MEMBERS TALKING ABOUT THIS THAT WERE. CONTINUALLY STREAMLINING SEQUEL -- FOR THESE MAJOR. ARENA PROJECTS WHICH AND I'M SUPPORTED -- THAT STREAMLINING -- BUT WHY CAN'T WE DO IT FOR HOUSING. TOO AND YOU KNOW WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE GROUND THE BATES ABOUT SEQUEL BECAUSE HE PUT THOSE SIR MANY VALUABLE PURPOSES WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT TO BE USED AROUND INFILL HOUSING. AND IS PARTICULARLY ABUSE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO SLOW DOWN AND STOP -- SUPPORTER PROJECTS FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE IN FACT IN MY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT NOW OR THE MAYOR IS TRYING TO PUT A NAVIGATION CENTER AT THE EMBARCADERO. AND THEIR NEIGHBORS WHO THROUGH GO FUND ME SIDE OF ALREADY RAISE MONEY TO HIRE A LAWYER TO FILE A CIVIL LAWSUIT AGAINST THAT WHEN THERE IS NO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THAT I CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF SO I'M A SUPPORTIVE AND I RECOMMEND THAT I BUILT. ON SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR I YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM WITH WITH VIDEO VIGNETTES IS IT EVERYBODY CAN COME UP WITH ONE THAT THAT TOP THAT REALLY EXPLAINS IT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ON IT THAT THE ONE I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT AND FRANKLY -- IN MONTEREY COUNTY AND THE CITY OF SALINAS THERE HAS. THERE THERE THERE IS THE THREAT OF SEQUEL LITIGATION OR ITS SEQUEL EDUCATION ON EVERY SINGLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT AND THE ONE THAT IS THE MOST RECENT WAS A FARM WORKER PROJECT OUT IN THAT COUNTY AND INCORPORATED AREA OF SPRECKELS WHICH WAS AN INDUSTRIAL SITE. AND HAD HAS NOT BEEN UTILIZED. FOR THIRTY YEARS AFTER SPRECKELS CLOSE THE PLANT -- A LOCAL COMPANY. HAD PLANS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THEIR WORK FORCE THE AT COMMUNITY OF SPARKLES DIDN'T WANT FARMWORKERS LIVING WITHIN PROXIMITY OF THEIR HOMES -- PUT UP A HUGE CHALLENGE AND FRANKLY SINCE THERE WERE NO PUBLIC FUNDS IN THE PROJECT THEY WENT AHEAD AND BUILT THE PROJECT WHILE THE SECRET. LITIGATION WAS PENDING AND ONCE IT WAS RESOLVED TO THAT -- WELL BASICALLY ONCE THAT HOUSING WAS BUILT -- THE SEQUEL LITIGATION WAS -- RESOLVED FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR BECAUSE IT REALLY HAD NO MERIT AND AND IT WHEN IT WENT AWAY SO IT SEEK WHAT IS USED REPEATEDLY -- IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AS A WAY TO INTIMIDATE. THE DEVELOPMENT OR FOR THE PERSON THAT'S GOING TO BE DOING THE DEVELOPMENT THE IN THIS CASE IT WAS AN AGRICULTURAL COMPANY AND THEY JUST THEY JUST WENT WENT AHEAD AND DID IT. AND HAT WAS BECAUSE THE JUDGE ORDERED THAT -- THAT THERE WAS COULD NOT GOING TO BE AN INJUNCTION. ON ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT AND SO. THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS TO GET THERE WHICH IN NO INJUNCTIONS CAN BE GRANTED -- AND THAT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND BUILD IT. TING A SEQUEL LAWSUIT BUT I I AGREE WITH YOU IF WE'RE GONNA DO SYKORA -- STREAMLINING FOR BIG PROJECTS AND I THINK THE WORD OKAY IT OUT VERY QUICKLY AND YOU'LL SEE VERY FEW SEQUEL TYPE LITIGATION CASES -- ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF THERE'S AN EXPEDITED REVIEW. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY OUT CENTER OFFICE TO THE BILL AND WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SENATE BILL SEVEN FORTY FOUR BY SENATOR CABALLERO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE SENATOR WIENER. WIENER IMRO. BATES. ZERO HI SEVERAL AYE DORADO MCGUIRE. MORLOCK. WARLOCK I ROTH. ROTH AYE SKINNER. SKINNER AYE AMBERG. NUMBER FIVE CASKEY. CASSIE NOW. OKAY I BETTER SIX BOTH SIDES OF THE BILL WILL BE ALFA WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN. WE'LL NOW GO TO ITEM SEVEN SP FORTY EIGHT ALL PRESENT AT ALL AND THE GAVEL TO CENTER BATES AND SPECIAL. THANK YOU FOR PATIENTS. PLEASE RECEIVED SENATE UNDER BATES -- COLLEAGUES -- I WILL SENATE BILL FORTY EIGHT WILL CREATE A STREAMLINED APPROVAL PROCESS -- FOR LOW BARRIER -- LOW BARRIER -- HOMELESS. SHELTERS THAT CONNECT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. TO SERVICES IN PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS. AS REPORTED CREATES A NEW STREAMLINED PROGRAM FOR WHAT WE CALL INTERIM SHELTER DEVELOPMENTS. THE GOAL OF WHICH IS TO EXPEDITE THE APPROVAL OF HIGH QUALITY LOW BARRIER SHELTERS I CONNECT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. TO SERVICES AND SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- ONLY SHELTERS THAT MEET ALL APPLICABLE HEALTH SAFETY AND BUILDING CODES -- THAT ALLOW FOR THE PRESENCE OF PARTNERS PATHS AND STORAGE OF POSSESSIONS. THAT PROVIDE PRIVACY AND OUR LOW BARRIER -- AND OFFER SERVICES TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO PERMANENT HOUSING ONLY THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS STREAMLINING. THE BILL ALSO MAKES CLARIFYING CHANGES TO HOUSING EXISTING HOUSING ELEMENT LAW. WITH REGARD TO ZONING -- IN TERMS OF WHERE MERGING SEE SHELTERS ARE ALLOWED AS A PERMITTED USE -- WITHOUT A CONDITIONAL USE DISCRETIONARY PERMANENT. AS YOU KNOW COLLEAGUES NEARLY POPULATION -- IS ON THE STREETS EVERY NIGHT IS I'M SHELTERED -- THE STAGGERING NUMBER IS A MORAL FAILURE -- BUT WE KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO WE NEED TO DO TO HELP PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND THE TRANSITION -- AND THE HOUSING -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT OTHER SHELTERS OTHER DO EXIST FOR SMALL THEY'RE BIG SWATHS OF THE STATE WITH NO SHELTER ACCESS EITHER NODE BEDS AT ALL. WAR ON VERY LIMITED ONLY IN THE WINTER -- AND THERE ARE ALSO SHELTERS WITH VERY HIGH BARRIERS SO THAT -- THERE ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY WILL NOT ACCESS THEM SO THE GOAL THIS BILL IS FIRST AND FOREMOST TO INCENTIVIZE -- THESE LOWER BARRIERS SHELTERS -- BUT THE BILL ALSO ADDRESSES THE EXISTING STREAMLINING PROVISION -- RIGHT NOW CITIES ARE REQUIRED IN THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT TO DESIGNATE AN AREA FOR EMERGENCY SHELTER ACCESS -- UNFORTUNATE ARE NO REAL CONSTRAINTS AROUND WHERE THEY CAN IDENTIFY THOSE PARCELS AND AND THERE ARE CITIES THAT ARE IDENTIFYING THEM. IN INDUSTRIAL AREAS THAT ARE REALLY. KNOW WHERE A BETTER NUMBER CLOSE TO SERVICES AND REALLY. KNOW WHERE THEY YOU WHATEVER POINT -- SHELTER US OF THE BILL -- WILL -- REQUIRE -- THAT -- THAT THE EMERGENCY SHELTER AREA AND THE HOUSING ELEMENT BE DESIGNATED EITHER IN A RESIDENTIAL OR MIXED USE AREA WORK IT IS IN OUR INDUSTRIAL AREA. THAT IT MEETS CERTAIN CRITERIA SO THAT IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH TO SERVICES THAT IT WILL ACTUALLY -- WORK -- SO COLLEAGUES THIS BILL WILL HELP EXPAND ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SHELTER AND THE LOW BARRIER -- SHELTER OF COURSE WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF GETTING PEOPLE ON THE HOUSING -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR OF THE BILL ARE ON YOUR LAWLER FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY.

THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AS A SENATOR SAID -- FOR ABOUT A DECADE STATE LAW HAS REQUIRED ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS-TO HAVE AT LEAST A ZONE WHERE EMERGENCY SHELTER CAN LOCATE BY RIGHT -- THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES OVER THE LAST DECADE IN IMPLEMENTING THAT LAW AND IT'S ALSO REALLY NOT PROVIDING THE SITES THAT WE NEED AT THE SCALE THAT WE NEED THEM TO PRODUCE THE SHELTER BEDS THAT WE NEED THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- WHILE THE SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS ULTIMATELY IS AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO VERY LOW AN EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN EVERY COMMUNITY IN THE STATE -- SHELTERS ARE CRUCIAL IN TERMS STEP TO ENSURING THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT LIVING ON THE STREETS IN CARS AND IN OTHER PLACES UNFIT FOR HUMAN HABITATION -- WALL THEY RECEIVE NEEDED SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE IN SECURING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AS HE FORTY EIGHT EXPANDS OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE HIGH QUALITY LOW BARRIER SHELTERS AND COMMUNITIES WHERE MORE SHELTER BEDS ARE CURRENTLY DESPERATELY NEEDED WE FRANKLY NEED TO GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MORE TOOLS TO GET BEYOND REACTIONARY OPPOSITION TO PROVIDING SHELTER TERM MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THIS BILL WOULD DO THAT. YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- AGAIN LIKE MS LAWLER SAID PERMANENT HOUSING IS THE SOLUTION HOMELESSNESS BUT SHELTERS PROVIDE A KEY ROLE IN ALLOWING ACCESS POINTS FOR GETTING PEOPLE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. AN SB FORTY EIGHT CREATES INCENTIVES FOR THE SHELTERS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF RESIDENTS INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SHELTERS TO OFFER THESE SERVICES TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO PERMANENT HOUSING. TO PROVIDE PRIVATE AND HABITABLE PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO SLEEP TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO ENTRY AND TO COMPLY WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY CODES WHICH WE ALL THINK ARE CRITICAL TO MAKING SHELTERS AS AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE AS POSSIBLE. SB FORTY EIGHT WITH EXPAND ACCESS TO SAFETY AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS AND FOR THIS REASON WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND OF WE SUPPORT THE BILLS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ANY GEORGE OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BUT IF AMENDED -- OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT WANT TO MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHEN WE'VE MET THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE ACCESSTO SERVICES.
