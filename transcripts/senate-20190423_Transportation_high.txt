WE WILL TAKE A MOTION ON THAT WILL GET A QUORUM AND WE WILL -- GET A CORPSMAN SAYS WE HAVE THE RECORD NUMBER MEMBERS RIGHT NOW. WE WILL OPERATE AS A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE. AND BEGIN TO HEAR BILLS. AND OUR FIRST SAUCER IS RIGHT HERE -- CENTER GLACIER. AND SIR GLACIERS PRESENTING I BELIEVE CENTER ON ON SB. THREE NINETY SEVEN AND CENTER -- YOU HAVE THE FLOOR AND SB THREE NINETY SEVEN PUBLIC TRANSIT OFFERS PASSENGERS WITH PAT. ON EVACUATION ORDERS CENTER YOU HAVE THE FLOOR ON THIS BILL. THANK THANK YOU -- CHAIR VAL AND AND MEMBERS. THE OPTION THAT THIS BILL DO YOU IT THAT REQUIRES TWO THINGS IT WOULD REQUIRE A PUBLIC TRANSIT OPERATOR. TO ALLOW PASSENGERS TO BOARD A TRANSIT VEHICLE WITH THEIR PETS. WHEN AN EVACUATION ORDER IS ISSUED? IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE IN EACH TRANSIT OPERATOR TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES FOR ALLOWING PETS ON PUBLIC TRANSIT -- THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE TYPES OF EVACUATION ORDERS. HI ACT AS EXPERTS ESTIMATE THAT OVER TEN THOUSAND PETS WERE DISPLACED BY THE WALLS THE HILL AND CAMPFIRES ALONE TEN THOUSAND PETS. THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLISHED A STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SHOWING THAT PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT TO EVACUATE. DURING A DISASTER WITHOUT THEIR PETS AND ANIMALS. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO NEARLY -- NINETEEN MILLION DOMESTIC PETS -- THE PREPARATION FOR THEIR EVACUATION TIMES EMERGENCY IS CRUCIAL TO THE SAFETY OF THE OWNERS AND THE PETS THEMSELVES. IN THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE KATRINA. CALAVERAS CONGRESS CONGRESS PASSED THE PETS ACT. IT MANDATED THAT DISASTER PREPAREDNESS PLANS ACCOUNT FOR COMPANION ANIMALS. HOWEVER ADOPTION OF THE SLOTS BEEN SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE NATION. INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA OUT OF A RESPONSE EMERGENCY SYSTEM DEVELOPED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX BY CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. ALONG WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG -- NOTED THAT RESOURCES FOR PLANNING TRAINING EVACUATING ANIMALS DURING EMERGENCIES WERE LACKING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HOWEVER THERE'S BEEN NO LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. ALLOWING PETS ON A PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION DURING EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ENSURING THAT BOTH PETS AND THEIR OWNERS. ABLE TO GET SAFELY -- TO AWAY FROM THESE DISASTERS. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN HERE THROUGH THE CROWDS OF FIVE SECURITY TO GET INTO THE BUILDING THIS. AYE FEARLESS ADVOCATE FOR THE BILL JENNIFER FEARING AND WE WELCOME HER TESTIMONY AS THE CHAIR REQUESTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAU YOUR TESTIMONY IN FAVOR OF THE BILL THANK YOU RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON MY NAME IS JENNIFER FEARING I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE SAN DIEGO HUMANE SOCIETY IN SUPPORT OF SB -- THREE NINE SEVEN AS THE CONTRACTED ANIMAL CONTROL AGENCY FOR TWELVE MUNICIPALITIES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. SAN DIEGO HUMANE SOCIETY IS CHARGED WITH PROVIDING EMERGENCY RESPONSE DURING TIMES OF DISASTER. AND DURING A MAJOR EVENTS PRIMARILY FAST MOVING FIRES ARE YOU MAY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DO JOIN WITH OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS TO ASSESS WITH ACCUSATIONS. REMOVING BARRIERS TO SELF EVACUATION SUCH AS ALLOWING RESIDENTS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WITH THEIR PETS WOULD FREE RESOURCES FOR MORE COMPLICATED EVACUATIONS LIKE LARGE ANIMAL RESCUE OR EVACUATION OF RURAL AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORT. SO AS THESE LARGE FIRE AND OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED EVENTS BECOME MORE THE NORM INSTEAD OF THE EXCEPTION WE DO APPRECIATE ALL EFFORTS AT THE STATE MAKES IT MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE AND THEIR PETS TO GET TO SAFETY SO. WE WITH THAT WE WOULD URGE YOUR YES VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU OTHERS SPEAKERS IN FAVOR PLEASE. YEAH. THE TRANSIT JUST WORKED IN THE NAPA VALLEY TURN. ALSO SUPPORT THIS BILL WE THINK IT MAKES A GOOD POLICY PEOPLE USUALLY JUST WANNA LEAVE THAT LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND. OKAY. OTHERS SPEAKERS PLEASE. MR TURN MEMBERS MADISON DOLLY ON BEHALF OF MARS PET CARE AND MARS INCORPORATED IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. FUTURE MEMBERS MICHAEL HIM TELL THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION WILL HAVE AND SOME SUPPORT POSITION ON THE BILL JUST YET BUT WE ARE LOOKING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE IT TAKES A VERY MINOR AMENDMENTS HOPEFULLY -- THAT CAN BETTER INSURE THAT BILLS OPERATIONALIZED AS INTENDED -- BUT OTHER THAN THAT -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING. FOR OKAY THANK YOU -- WE HAVE SPEAKERS -- OPPOSING THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD ANYBODY'S OPPOSING. THIS BILL THIS IS THE US BE -- THREE NINETY SEVEN SIR GLAZERS WILL ANYBODY OPPOSING -- I SEEN ON ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. SENATOR DODD YEAH I I TOTALLY SUPPORT THE BILL I'M IS. THE VOTE ON YES ON THIS BUT I GUESS I WONDERED YOU KNOW IT ARE THERE ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE KEEP CALM LIKE -- YOU KNOW OTHER PASSENGERS ON THERE LIKE BEING. NO ATTACK BY A PIT BULL OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE I MEAN LOOK AT AYE AYE. I JUST THINK WE OUGHT TO THINK THESE THINGS THROUGH -- THEN THE MOST WE CAN BEFORE WE JUST PASS A BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO I I JUST. WORRY ABOUT THAT PARTICULARLY DURING A STRESSFUL TIME IN -- PEOPLE ARE FREAKING OUT AND THAT MAKES ANIMALS AND EASY YEAH WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THAT. AFTER GLAZER HAVE A QUARTER A QUESTION CAN YOU ANSWER. THANK YOU AT YOUR BILL AND AND SENATOR DODD. IT IS A GOOD QUESTION AND IT CERTAINLY IS A POTENTIAL -- THING THAT COULD HAPPEN OUT THERE THAT'S WHY PART OF THE BILL IS TO ASK EACH TRANSIT OPERATOR TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES. OFFER ALLOWING PETS -- SO IT DOES INCORPORATE THOSE KINDS OF SIR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY OCCUR AND TO HAVE THEM THINK THAT THOSE ISSUES THROUGH. SO THAT THEY CAN BE DONE APPROPRIATELY IT'S NOT MEANT THAT A A PET SHOULD DISPLACING A PERSON. AND CERTAINLY -- AN ANIMAL THAT IS NOT IN THE RIGHT CONDITION TO BE TRANSPORTED IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. SO IT'S MY HOPE THAT THAT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS GOING TO DEAL WITH EXACTLY THAT QUESTION WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT. ONE OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I SEE NONE. CENTER -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WHICH ARE LOS THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THIS BILL. WE CARE ABOUT OUR PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE WE ALSO CARE ABOUT OUR FOUR LEGGED FRIENDS. AND THIS IS TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO HELP BOTH BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WON'T LEAVE. IF THEY'RE LEAVING BEHIND THEIR THEIR FAVORITE PACKED WITH THEM SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND THAT BALANCE THIS BILL THANK YOU -- WE GOT COCO CHANEL. WELL THIS IS IN SUPPORT. COCOS BEEN A VERY GOOD COM DOG THAT'S COCOA. ALL RIGHT CENTER GALGIANI SO LOVE [inaudible] ALL. DONE. WHAT WE'LL DO IS TURN OVER CENTER DOT DOT WILL PRESENT CENTER DOT WILL PRESENT HIS BILL -- EVERYBODY THIS IS ITEM SEVEN ARGENTO'S SAYS BE. THREE THREE SIX TRANSPORTATION FULLY AUTOMATED TRANSIT VEHICLES THIS IS SENATOR DODD'S BILL EVERYBODY -- SB. THREE THREE SIX AND SIR YOU HAVE THE FLOOR FOR THE PRISON THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SB THREE THREE SIX REQUIRES THE PRESENCE OF AT LEAST ONE PUBLIC TRANSIT EMPLOYEE ON ANY FULLY AUTOMATED TRANSIT VEHICLE. FULLY AUTOMATED VEHICLES CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE TRANSIT BUT THEY POSE RISK AS WELL ESPECIALLY PUBLIC SAFETY OF TRANSIT RIDERS AND ACCESSIBILITY FOR DISABLED CUSTOMERS. TRIP TO THE BOYS OFTEN SERVICE SOCIAL WORKERS ON THERE PUBLIC TRANSIT VEHICLES DISABLED AND ELDERLY PASSENGERS RIDING THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR PARA TRANSIT. RELY ON TRANSIT EMPLOYEES TO HELP THEM ONBOARD AND OFF BOARD SECURE WHAT WHEELCHAIRS AND OTHER SERVICES. SCHOOL CHILDREN COMMUTE TO SCHOOL USING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WITHOUT AN EMPLOYEE ON BOARD THESE CHILDREN WILL NOT RIDE. TO WITH ADULT SUPERVISION. WITH ADULTS OR SUPERVISION. PASSENGERS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RANDOM OR PLANNED ACTS OF VIOLENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASSAULT AS WELL AS A HOST OF OTHER SAFETY CONCERNS WHEN LEFT ALONE ON THE VEHICLE. ADDITIONALLY OVER A MILLION DRIVERS TRANSPORT PASSENGERS FOR A LIVING PUBLIC TRANSIT JOBS ARE STABLE JOBS AT GOOD WAGES AND BENEFITS THIS IS STAY IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. FULLY AUTOMATIC AUTOMATED PUBLIC TRANSIT WOULD DISPLACE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS WITHOUT. RETRAINING OF JOB CREATORS A RETRAINING OF JOB CREATION PLAN NOT ONLY DOES THIS IMPACT WORKERS BUT THEIR FAMILIES BUT ALSO IN THEIR FAMILIES BUT ALSO IMPACT STATE'S BUDGET. THIS BILL REQUIRES THE PRESENCE OF THE LEAST ONE PUBLIC TRANSIT EMPLOYEE ON ANY FULLY AUTOMATED VEHICLE THERE FOR CALIFORNIA CAN GREATLY REDUCE THE RISK OF PASSENGERS MIGHT FACE WHEN REWRITING IT FULLY AUTONOMOUS. TRANSIT BECAUSE I PROTECT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION JOBS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE IN HERE TO TESTIFY IN THIS BILL -- FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR -- FOR FEDERATION ALSO MATT BROUGHT UP REPRESENTING THE AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION. OKAY WITNESSES IN FAVOR THE BILL PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ACTUALLY SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AN AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL -- ALONG WITH -- THE MACHINISTS AYE OF P. T. E. LOCALS TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE THE INLAND BOATMEN ME TO UNION UNITE HERE AND OTHERS -- ALL IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- THE USER CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL THE TEAMSTERS IN ABOUT A MINUTE TRANSIT UNIT REPRESENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF TRANSIT WORKERS IN THE STATE. AND AND AND FOR THESE WORKERS THIS BILL IS. AT ITS VERY CORE ABOUT THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE THEIR TRANSIT MEMBERS PROVIDE ON A DAILY BASIS -- THEIR JOBS ARE JUST. TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL AND STEPPING ON THE GAS -- DAY PROVIDE. A MYRIAD OF SERVICES INCLUDING BEING A LOCAL SOCIAL WORKER. BREAKING UP FIGHTS -- PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST RESPONDER -- THEY PROTECT OUR KIDS -- THEY HAD ASSIST THE ELDERLY AND THE DISABLED AND WITH. THE ONSET OF A OF AUTOMATED VEHICLES THOSE NEEDS THOSE NEEDS FOR THE SERVICES DON'T GO AWAY. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT IT KNOWLEDGE IS TO BE FOR THE SERVICES AND PROVIDE A CREATIVE WAY THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THEM WITHOUT HANDCUFFING THE TRANSIT AGENCIES -- SOME FOLKS WANT US TO PROVIDE A LICENSE COMMERCIALLY DRIVER A COMMERCIALLY LICENSED DRIVER IN THE VEHICLE. THE TEAMSTERS AND AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION REPRESENT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COMMERCIALLY LICENSED DRIVERS WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE COMMERCIALLY LICENSED DRIVERS IN ALL OF THE BUSES BUT THAT'S NOT REALISTIC WE NEED TO HAVE REALISTIC POLICIES. THIS BILL PROVIDES AN EMPLOYEE THAT CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICES WITHOUT. WITH PROVIDING THE MAXIMUM LEVEL FLEXIBILITY SO WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL [inaudible] THIS PLEASE. IS TO TURN MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS MEASURE. COME FROM MY PERSPECTIVE OF WE AS THE STATE HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH THE FUTURE OF WORK AND ENSURING THAT THERE WILL STILL BE JOBS -- AS WE SEE INCREASED AUTOMATION AND TECHNOLOGY USED ON TO CHANGE WORK AND ALSO IN SOME CASES TO DISPLACE WORKERS. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL IS MEANT TO DO IS -- TO UNDERSTAND THAT SURE THERE ARE GOING TO BE CHANGES TO THE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE USED -- AND THAT CAN BE THAT CAN BE GOOD OR BAD DEPENDING IN THE WAY THAT THOSE TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEPLOYED -- BUT THAT WE CAN YOU WE AS POLICY AS YOU AS POLICY MAKERS AND WE AS UNIONS CAN PLAY A ROLE IN HELPING TO SHAPE THAT FUTURE. AND HELPING TO INSURE THAT WORKING PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE TO FIND A MEANINGFUL WORK SO THAT'S THE GOAL WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE WITH THIS BILL HERE IN. STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES PLEASE -- STEVE ALL COMING UP THE NAPA VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND THE ALAMEDA CHARACTER -- ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA TRANSIT DISTRICT ALSO SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GERMAN RECESS ARE DIEM HALF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED ASK FOR SUPPORT A OTHER -- WITNESSES -- OKAY -- WE HAVE THE OPPOSITION COME FOR PLEASE [inaudible] THANK YOU. YOU GOV RIGHT HERE. HAVE A SEAT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. MICHAEL HIM UNTIL THE CALIFORNIA TRANSITION WE ARE BETWEEN -- ON THIS BILL DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL TO HISTORICALLY -- OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT PRE JUDGING -- THE FUTURE OF WORK IN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A TRANSITION POINT MEANT -- PARTICULARLY PARTICULARLY AS THESE VEHICLES HAVE NOT YET BEEN DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY TRANSIT AGENCIES -- WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE BUILDING MORE THOROUGHLY I AND IF THERE'S ANY FEEDBACK THAT COMES FROM THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE CONSIDERING THAT AS WELL. ON WILL BE TAKEN DECISION AT THAT TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES SIR MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARE MIKE ANDERSON WITH THE SHEET METAL AIR RAIL TRANSPORTATION FORMALLY UNITED TRANSPORTATION UNION. AND WHAT WE CONCUR WITH THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN NUMBER SIX ABOUT THE TRIAL PERIOD. THAT HAVE SUNSET AND ALSO WE THINK THAT THE PERSON ON BOARD SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF OPERATING THE VEHICLE -- IF IT BECOMES NECESSARY. WE THINK THIS MAINTAINS A LEVEL OF SAFETY. FOR NOT ONLY THE PASSENGERS THE EMPLOYEE. AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT SURROUNDS IT MUST BE SHARE THE ROAD WITH. FISH THESE VEHICLES SO WITH WITH THAT THAT'S ALL THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY I GOT -- OTHER WITNESSES -- OPPOSITION. OKAY QUESTIONS IN QUESTION SIR DODD YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THOSE CONCERNS WERE READ WE LOOKED AT THAT THE ALMOST CERTAINLY AND I THINK -- YES JAMES -- SAID IT'S YOU KNOW SOMETHING WERE -- YEAH WE GOT BE REALISTIC AND WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT THIS -- YOUR THROUGH A MORE YUP. YUP BROADLANDS AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE CAME UP WITH WAS HAVING SOMEBODY ON BOARD THEY CAN. ASSIST WITH PASSENGERS DISABLED PASSENGERS YOUNG KIDS -- AND ALSO -- YOU AT THE END OF THE DAY -- AS SOME OF THESE OTHER ISSUES COME UP -- YEAH WE CAN DEAL WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE BUT WE WE JUST FELT THAT THIS WAS THE PROPER WAY TO GO. MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D ALSO JUST ADD TO THAT THAT. WHAT THE IN THE BILL IT IT DEFINES FULLY AUTOMATED VEHICLE AND THESE VEHICLES WILL NOT HAVE ANY CONTROLS FOR A LICENSED DRIVER TO OPERATE? SO. DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF AUTOMATED VEHICLE THERE ARE WHAT'S THAT MEAN. LIKE THERE'S STAGE ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND FIVE YOU KNOW IT'S UP. THEY GET TO FIVE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY. STRUCTURE TO IT BUT IF IT'S A FOR THAT MIGHT HAVE A I AM A DEVICE OR STEERING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OTHERS. DIFFERENT TYPES OF AUTOMATED VEHICLES SO. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE THE ISSUE WE'LL SEE. IF IT WERE GOING TO HAVE A FIVE YEAR PERIOD WITH THIS LAW WILL BE IN EFFECT. UNDER THE MOTION. AND IT'LL BE AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YEAH I THINK INSTEAD OF MANDATING IT RIGHT. BECAUSE TIME GOES ON IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- IS FELT BY THE TRANSIT OPERATORS IN THAT THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES SOME CLEAN UP LANGUAGE COULD BE BROUGHT INTO. TO MODIFY BUT FOR NOW THIS IS THE FIRST STEP YEAH WE HAVE SEVERAL TEST ON AUTOMATED VEHICLES GOING ON AROUND THE STATE AND WE HAD A HEARING IN THIS COMMITTEE ON THE SUBJECTS SO I THINK. WE'RE GETTING TO A POINT WERE IN -- FUTURE. YEARS WE'RE GOING TO START SEEING. SOME RESULTS ON THOSE -- TEST AND SEE WOOD. THINGS LIKE THE ACCIDENT RATE WITH -- HOW? I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS FOR ME HOW. AUTOMATED VEHICLES DEAL WITH THE DISABLED PEOPLE WITH -- DIFFERENT KINDS OF ABILITIES -- ELDERLY -- CHILDREN YOU KNOW THOSE KINDS OF THINGS OUT UNDER THE COCOA YEAH -- HOW DO THEY DEAL WITH -- DODD AND AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SAFE -- A LOT OF OUR TRANSIT -- WORKERS. TO SPECIAL BUSES. FOR ESPECIALLY THE THE TEAMSTERS IN MY AREA OR DO A LOT OF BUS DRIVING FOR THE SPECIAL ED CHILDREN -- YOU KNOW THE DISABLED -- THE DEVELOPMENT DISABLED -- SO WE REALLY DEPEND ON THOSE DRIVERS. TO TAKE CARE OF OUR OUR CHILDREN HILL CALLING YOU KNOW MY FAMILY. AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CONCERN THAT WE THEY DO A GREAT JOB BY THE WAY SO. REALLY APPRECIATE THEIR ABSOLUTELY -- CARE FOR PEOPLE ON HAVING A DRIVER'S REALLY IMPORTANT. SO SIR GALGIANI HAS A COMMENT CENTER IN THAT EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN OTHER COUNTRIES TO HAVE HIGH SPEED RAIL EVEN THOUGH THOSE TRAINS HAVE POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL THEY STILL UTILIZE. OPERATORS AND SO I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IN THIS BILL IS IN LINE WITH WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES WHO HAVE A TECHNOLOGY. ARE STILL DOING. YEAH. HE SAID OKAY SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WILL HAVE CONSIDERATION. WILL REACH THANK YOU -- SIR MORE ART. SIR MORE LUXURIOUS TWO BILLS SIR MARK -- YOU HAVE -- ITEM THIRTEEN IS SB FOUR FOUR SEVEN AND I AM -- SIXTEEN SB. FIVE ONE ONE AND SAID THE FLOOR. THANK YOU COULD PICK WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO START WITH FOUR FOUR SEVEN YES SIR OKAY WE'LL START WITH. FOUR FOUR SEVEN COLLEAGUES SP FOUR FOUR SEVEN TRANSFERS TWO PARCELS OF LAND. FROM CALTRANS TO THE CITY OF ORANGE. ONE PARCEL IS A PORTION OF HEART PARK A VERY POPULAR IN SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT. OF THE CITY'S PARKS SYSTEM IS JASON TO THE TWENTY TWO FREEWAY ALSO KNOWN AS THE GARDEN GROVE FREEWAY. THE LAND. USE WOULD BE RESTRICTED TO PARK LAND IS IT'S NOW CURRENTLY LANDMARK INSIDE. THE PARK FOR RECREATIONAL OPEN SPACE THE OTHER PARCELS A PORTION OF HANDY PARK ADJACENT TO THE FIFTY FIVE FREEWAY ALSO KNOWN AS THE COSTA MESA FREEWAY. THAT HE'S CALL INSIDE THESE PROPERTIES REQUIRED BACK IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES -- BY CALTRANS DURING CONSTRUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT OF THESE TWO STATE HIGHWAYS ORANGE COUNTY IS NOW THE SECOND MOST DENSELY POPULATED COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA JUST BEHIND. SAN FRANCISCO PARK LAND IS PRICELESS PRESERVING IT IS THE GOAL OF SB. FOUR FOUR SEVEN AS CALTRANS DOES NOT INTEND TO RENEW ITS PORTER BILL LEASE WITH THE CITY OF ORANGE. IT BEHOOVES THE LEGISLATURE TO RESOLVE THE MANAGEMENT. OF THESE CRITICAL ASSETS IN A RESPONSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE MANNER. FOR THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE A WITNESS MISS BONNIE HAGEN FROM THE CITY OF ORANGE THANK YOU OF WELCOME YOU HAVE THE FLOOR YES. THE OTHER AFTERNOON I CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS BONNIE HAGEN AND I'M THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF ORANGE. ON BEHALF OF THE CITY I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL. FOUR FOUR SEVEN THE CITY OF ORANGES A HARD WORKING MIDDLE CLASS CITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS AND RICK RICH AGRICULTURAL HISTORY. WITHIN THE CITY ARE TO PARKS CALLED HEART PARK IN HANDY PARK BOTH PARKS ARE LOCATED ADJACENT TO MAJOR FREEWAYS I IN ORANGE COUNTY AND ARE WIDELY USED BY OUR RESIDENTS RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORING CITIES YOUTH SPORTS GROUPS HIGH SCHOOLS AND EVEN LOCAL UNIVERSITIES. PORTIONS OF THE TWO PARKS ARE OWNED BY THE CITY WHILE OTHER PORTIONS ARE OWNED BY CALTRANS. CALTRANS PURCHASE THOSE PROPERTIES FROM PRIVATE ENTITIES IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES. FOR THE USE DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TWENTY TWO AND FIFTY FIVE FREEWAY. ONCE CALTRANS DETERMINED THAT THE PROPERTIES WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY THEY LEASE THEM TO THE CITY OF ORANGE THROUGH WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE PORTER BELLY'S. THE UNIQUE TYPE OF LEASE GAVE THE CITY THE LAND UNDER THE CONDITION THAT IT WOULD BE USED AS RECREATION AND OPEN SPACE FOR THE DURATION OF THE LEASE. THE CITY OF ORANGE ENTERED INTO TWO SEPARATE FIFTY YEAR LONG PORTABILITY SAYS WITH CALTRANS FOR HEART PARK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE AND HANDY PARK IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR THE CITY WAS ALERTED BY CALTRANS DISTRICT TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT CALTRANS HAD NO INTENTION OF RENEWING THE FIFTY YEAR PORTER BUT LEASES AND INSTEAD. WOULD GO THROUGH THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS TO SELL THE PROPERTY AS EXCESS PLANT. DUE TO THE COMPLICATED FACTORS SURROUNDING THE CURRENT USE OF THE LAND AND THE NATURE OF THE PORTER BUT LEASES THE CURRENT LAW THAT GOVERNS THE DISPOSAL CALTRANS SURPLUS LAND DOESN'T FULLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE FACTORS WHEN DETERMINING A PURCHASE AND SALE PRICE. THE CITY OF ORANGE AND ITS RESIDENTS VALUE. PARK IN OPEN SPACE IN THE COMMUNITY. THE CITY IS WILLING AND ABLE TO TAKE AND MAINTAIN THE PARKS FROM CALTRANS AS PART OF THE CITY'S EXISTING PARKS SYSTEM. SB FOUR FOUR SEVEN WOULD ENSURE THAT THESE TO CRUCIAL PUBLIC PARKS CONTINUE TO BE RECREATION AND OPEN SPACE FOR EVER. THE CITY IS WILLING TO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ADD A PURCHASE PROVISION FOR THESE PARKS AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT TRANSFER PRISON PROVISION THAT'S IN. FOUR FOUR SEVEN WE HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH SENATOR MORE LUCK AND CAL TRANS TO ENSURE THAT OUR RESIDENTS HAVE SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO PARKS AND OPEN SPACE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING YOUR CONSIDERATION OF SB. FOUR FOUR SEVEN THIS IS IN FAVOR PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] OKAY -- WITNESSES OPPOSING THE BILL. SHANE ON THE CENTER OF FOR ME -- APPRECIATE YOUR BILL IS BRING IT FORWARD -- I THINK IT'S HOWEVER. A BILL THAT IS -- SOMEWHAT PREMATURE AND A LIGHT IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE LEASE EXPIRES. TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR SO. WE DO HAVE TIME. TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CALTRANS ON THIS ISSUE. A PERSONALLY I FEEL -- CALTRANS THE LAW IS THE CALTRANS THE CITY AS A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. THERE'S SO OF PROTECTIONS THERE ARE. ARE THEY CAN'T -- HOW DO YOU SAY GO AHEAD JUST SO IT FROM OUT FROM UNDER THE CITY AT THAT SO I DON'T THINK THE PLAN TO DO THAT? FIVE YOU KNOW I KNOW THEY'RE NOT -- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT -- NEGOTIATING A PRICE THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS PROBABLY NOT. A GOOD WAY TO WORK WITH CALTRANS. SO -- MAYBE YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT I I PREFER THAT YOU. HOLD THE BILL. FOR YEAR CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CALTRANS. AND SEE IF WE CAN COME TO SOME AGREEMENT. OVER THE NEXT -- FEW MONTHS. THAT WOULD BE WHAT MY PREFERENCE WITH LINE AND OTHER WORDS I'M NOT SAYING. NO. WE'LL KEEP WORKING ON IT -- I THINK WARRANT YOU MADE A GOOD CASE FOR ORANGE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT BUT ALL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR USE. GUY. TRUST AND KNOW WHY I KNOW I CAN WORK WITH HIM ON THIS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I AM -- THAT'S WHAT I'M CONSIDERING FOR THIS BILL. NOT RECOMMENDING AT THIS TIME BUT CONTINUED. TO WORK WITH THE IF YOU -- MAKE IT A IN THE SECOND YOUR BILL. THAT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE. OTHER COMMENTS FROM OTHER MEMBERS. MAY I SUPPORT THE BILL IN THAT WAY AND IN THAT IN THAT FRAMEWORK. I AM HAPPY TO MAKE IT TO YOUR BILL MISTER CHAIR THANKS FOR THE COUNCIL AYE. WE DID WORK HARD. WORK IN OUR THE PRICE. MADE A FAIR OFFER BUT LET'S GO AHEAD AND NOT TAKE A VOTE AND WILL MAKE THIS A TO YOUR BILL. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WORK WITH YOU AND SURVEYS. BECAUSE SHE'S THE OWNER TO WRITE YOUR ORANGE COUNTY [inaudible] OKAY. NOT YOUR CITY BUT THE LEGISLATURE ALLOWED YEAH I DO TOO I'M GRANT TOTALLY AGREE -- OKAY CENTER YOU HAVE A SECOND BILL I'LL GIVE IT A SECOND SHOT HERE. WITH THE SENATE BILL FIVE ELEVEN BY THE WAY AND COLLEAGUES A AND A HALF AGO -- DURING THAT THE BREAK IN AT THE END OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN I I CAME UP TO THE CAPITAL. AND SPECIFICALLY MET WITH SECRETARY STATE ALEX PADILLA I I'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF PHONE CALLS AND EMAILS -- FROM MY CONSTITUENTS AS THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MOTOR VOTER. AND SO. IT'S THE SECRETARY AND I HAD A REALLY GOOD MEETING AT HIS OFFICE ANY ASSURED ME THAT. EVERYTHING WAS TAKEN CARE OF THAT THERE WOULD BE NO. REASON TO BE CONCERNED -- ALMOST LIKE A ABSOLUTELY NOT DON'T WORRY THAT ONE NON CITIZEN WILL NOT BE REGISTERED THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS. EVEN THOUGH AT THE TIME THE BILL THAT APPROVED MOTOR VOTER WAS GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND EVEN UP TO THE IMPLEMENTATION HI EVERYONE WAS WARNING THAT THE SOFTWARE WAS NOT. READY IT WASN'T FULLY COOKED AS ONE TERM KEEPS BEING USED AROUND HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE LEARN OF A DMV INTERNAL WHAT IT SHOWING THAT ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE BEEN IMPROPERLY REGISTERED TO VOTE. SO I FOLLOWED UP WITH A LETTER TO THE SECRETARY AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH HIS OFFICES. IN TRYING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP. COLLEAGUES I'M I'M SOMEONE WHO -- OBTAINED THE PRIVILEGE TO BOTH THE HARD WAY I HAD TO EARN IT I BECAME A CITIZEN OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY. THEREFORE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE IS PRETTY SACRED. TO ME. CONSEQUENTLY WITH I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE MY CONCERNS FOR THE AUDIT RESULTS WITH REMEDIES WE HAD A GOOD BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW HEARING MONDAY MORNING FIRST THING WITH. REGARDS TO THE WEIGHT LINES AT THE DMV WHICH DIDN'T HAVE TO DO WITH MOTOR VOTER MORE WITH -- THE REAL ID BUT WE HAD A GOOD CHANCE TO TALK TO THE ACTING DIRECTOR. AND THE SECRETARY FOR GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS SB FIVE ELEVEN RECOMMENDS ESTABLISHING A COMMITTEE TO FACILITATE THE BETTER SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH REGARDS TO MOTOR VOTER. I'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER VOTERS NEIL KELLY. A PROFESSIONAL WHO I ENJOYED WORKING WITH AS A FELLOW DEPARTMENT HEAD AND THEN IT AS HIS BOSS IS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. SB FIVE ELEVEN IS THE RESULT OF OUR COLLABORATION THE LAST THING WE NEED IS A DARK SHADOW HANGING OVER CALIFORNIA'S ELECTION PROCESS LET'S GET THE PARTIES TOGETHER DISCONTINUE THE BLAME GAMES AND FOCUS ON PREVENTING FUTURE ERRORS IN ORDER TO RESTORE VOTER CONFIDENCE IN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO MANAGE THROUGH THE SITUATION. BUT GOALS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE TO ADDRESS ONE PROPER TRAINING AND TO BETTER SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT. THE COLLABORATION SHOULD PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND A FINISHED PRODUCT THAT CLOSES THE BREACH TO THE SATISFACTION OF ALL IMPACT THE DEPARTMENTS. WITH THE INCREASES IN THE STABBING FUNDING AND AUDITS THE DMV HAS BEEN VERY BUSY OF LATE TRYING TO CATCH UP. BUT IT ALSO NEEDS TO INITIATE PROACTIVE EFFORTS TO MOVE FORWARD. TOWARD AN ERROR FREE ENVIRONMENT. DELAYING OR MAKING EXCUSES SHOWS A LACK OF MANAGERIAL LEADERSHIP ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WE CANNOT. LET THAT HAPPEN IT'S TIME TO FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE A WITNESS MISTER. FRIEDMAN. HISTORY OF THE FLOOR HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JIMMY FROM ANIMAL DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE ARE THE NONPROFIT. LEGAL AID AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES -- ONE OF THE PRIMARY KEYSTONES OF WHAT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA'S IS BASED ON OUR BELIEF ON EQUAL.% AND PASSIONATE FULL LIVES FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES AND A BIG PART OF THAT IS ENGAGING FOR US IS ENGAGING SYSTEMATIC ADVOCACY. TO ENSURE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF VOTER INFO WHICH IS WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY -- DEMOCRACY WORKS ONLY WITH CLEAN AND HONEST ELECTIONS AND WE FEEL THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT EVERY VOTE IS COUNTED ADEQUATELY. ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY ONE REQUIRED THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE DMV TO ESTABLISH. THE NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM UNFORTUNATELY SINCE THEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF INS COVERED SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION. THE DMV IS REPORTED THAT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ERRORS WERE DISCOVERED AND DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSING ERROR. SB FIVE ELEVEN SIX TO ELIMINATE THE MARGIN OF ERROR BY ESTABLISHING A COMMITTEE WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND COUNTIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING THE SHARING OF INFORMATION. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES TRAINING FOR DMV EMPLOYEES FOR VOTER REGISTRATION AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TWELVE WITNESSES OPPOSING THE BILL PLEASE ANY WITNESSES OPPOSING THE BILL -- QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE OF I THINK ONE OF THE ONE OF THE REASONS-WHY I HAVE RELUCTANCE ON THIS BILL CENTER. IS YOUR TRAINING PEOPLE ACTUALLY THE TONE. WORK WITH MOTOR VOTER. IN THE DMV AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT -- JUST. TO AFTER THE BILL DOESN'T SEEM. TO FOCUS ON THE PROBLEM AND ACTUALLY. CREATES A PROBLEM IN MY OPINION. SO I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. NOW THAT I'M TWO FOR TWO YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. TODAY. IS SATURDAY BE BETTER. ACTUALLY ONE AND A HALF TO TWO YEAH BUT MR TURN NOT REALLY A BIG ADVOCATE FOR SETTING UP MORE COMMITTEES RIGHT. BUT I THINK THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE. AND AND JUST YOU KNOW LETTING THINGS GO ON THEIR OWN HASN'T BEEN WORKING QUITE WELL. SO I I DON'T THINK I WANT TO MAKE THIS INTO YOUR BILL I'LL GO AHEAD AND PUT UP FOR BOTH MAKE YOU KILL IT OUT RIGHT OKAY THERE'S NO. THANK YOU OF FIGURES AND ARMOR LOCK -- FOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- WHO THE COMMITTEE REPORT TO AND -- BUT THE LEGISLATURE AND SECRETARY OF STATE TERROR [inaudible] HOW THAT? COMMUNICATION HAPPEN IF IT SHOULD IT SHOULD CONCLUDE WITH THE YOU KNOW AT THE AT THE CAUGHT A WHITE PAPER IT SHOULD COME TO THE LEGISLATURE IT SHOULD PROVIDE FOR PROPER TRAINING -- PROTOCOLS AND IT SHOULD -- PROVIDE FOR BETTER SOFFER MANAGEMENT -- SO THAT -- THE REGISTRARS OF THE STATE ARE A FEELING COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THAT THE DMV IS -- ACTUALLY BEING CAREFUL ABOUT HOW ITS HANDLING VOTER REGISTRATIONS. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW YOU CAN TO GET FIVE QUESTIONS ON A SCREEN AND LEAVES EVERYBODY. USED IN BEWILDERED -- SO -- THAT WOULD BE THE THE GOAL THE END PRODUCT AND THEN IT WOULD JUST GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE GET EVERYTHING. YOU KNOW RUNNING IN A IN A PROPER FASHION. AND HOW WITH THE OF MEMBERS -- OF THE COMMITTEE BE CHOSEN IN SENATE AND GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTMENT OR HIS SECRETARYOF STATE APPOINT SOMEBODY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLE -- PLACES SOMEBODY ON THERE HOW HOW THAT HAPPENED RIGHT NOW IT'S SELF APPOINTED TO ASSURE MAKE SOME AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IT REAL SPECIFIC BUT WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT HOW DO WE GET YOU KNOW. WE ARE MAKE IT SO UBER FORMAL IT'S LIKE LET'S GET SOMETHING DONE REPORT BACK TO US HELP US OUT. WITHOUT MAKING IT A YOU KNOW. SO THIS IS MORE IT IS IT'S INFORMATION ON AMBER INFORMATION FINDING IT DOESN'T PROVIDE A A MANDATE THAT -- THEIR FINDINGS HAVE TO BE MANDATED INTO SERVICE OR AS A WAY TO EDUCATE THE DMB ON HOW TO BETTER -- RUN THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM IT'S IT'S THE LATTER IT INTO ITS LET'S LET'S IT'S A IT'S A I'M GETTING THE IMPRESSION CENTER STONE THAT YOU KNOW IF WE WERE BOTH FROM SUPERVISOR LAND. AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE I HAVE TO MANAGE THE STATE OR WE HAVE TO SOMEHOW MANAGED TO STATE THROUGH LEGISLATION. AND SO THIS WAS THE IDEA IT WAS OKAY LET'S. IT'S GOT A COMMITTEE TOGETHER -- BECAUSE WE NEED TO REASSURE THE VOTERS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT ALLOWING. NON RESIDENTS TO REGISTER TO VOTE. AND SO WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY SO. WHAT'S IT WHAT'S A CORDIAL WAY TO FACILITATE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND THIS IS THE APPROACH WE TOOK. WELL OBVIOUSLY -- THE STRUCTURE WITH THE THE DEPARTMENT OR VEHICLES WE SET A LARGE HEARING OF ONE WAS AT THE MONDAY -- YEAH. THE DAYS AGO BY SO FAST HERE AND AND WE HAVE A WE HAVE A AN AGENCY THAT HAS A LOT A LOT OF ISSUES AND FORTUNATELY WE HAVE A TASKMASTER THE NICELY. SECRETARY THAT WAS THERE -- CAM OR HER NAME BUT SHE WAS WONDERFUL AND SHE HAS SIX MONTHS TO COME UP WITH -- RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE CAN MAKE OUR DEPARTMENT OF A MOTOR VEHICLES A STELLAR DEPARTMENT -- I MENTIONED DURING THAT HEARING THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONE INTERACTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE BULLS COMMON WITH THE STATE AGENCY AND THAT FIRST IMPRESSION IS A LASTING IMPRESSION AND CERTAINLY. THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DMP IS BEEN GIVING AND I ALSO QUALIFY THIS OF 90% OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE DMV ARE HARD WORKING DEDICATED PEOPLE I JUST THINK THERE WAS A LACK OF LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP THAT. BECAUSE THE THE AGENCY DIFFICULT THE FUNDER -- BUT I SEE THIS IS -- AWAY TO HELP IDENTIFY PROBLEMS AND THE RESULTS AREN'T NECESSARILY MANDATED I THINK IT'S A GOOD WAY TO BRING TO LIGHT -- ISSUES A COULD IMPROVE THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM -- AND FOR THOSE REASONS MISTER SHERROD I UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR OPPOSITION BELOW I LIKE TO MOVE IT AND WITH THE COURTESY TO MY COLLEAGUE AND I I DO SUPPORT THE BILL. THURSTONE ALL OAKLAWN YOU'LL REACH COR. OKAY. SIR DO YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS TO MAKE DOES THAT YOU KNOW ARE. YOU KNOW YOU YOU JUST SIT HERE AS A AS A SENATOR YOU CHECK A WEEK IDENTIFIED AN ISSUE LET'S SEE. WHAT WE CAN DO IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER TO GET RESOLVED WITHOUT YOU KNOW CREATING? A COMMITTEE THE LAST FOR UMPTEEN YEARS YOU CAN BE ANOTHER BOX WE CAN'T BLOW UP. LET'S LET'S JUST GO AHEAD AND TRY SOMETHING IN A IN A IN A FORMAL THE IF AND I'M A KIND OF AN INFORMAL FASHION TO GET THINGS ACCOMPLISHED AND I COURT ARE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THE USER BATES HAD A COMMENT SENATE JUST A QUICK COMMENT HAVING GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS MYSELF AND BEEN A SOMEWHAT CONFUSED BY THE SCREENSHOT FROM. I THINK BOB I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT SENATOR MORLOCKS APPROACH HERE IS THAT. WITH THE COMMITTEE TAKING A LOOK AT WHERE THE ERRORS OCCUR IT WILL BECOME VERY APPARENT IT IS IN THE FIRST SCREEN WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO BE REGISTERED BECAUSE OR YOU DON'T WANT TO BE REGISTERED BECAUSE WHAT I HAVE. UNDERSTOOD FROM THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON WHERE THIS IS HAPPENED OR BEEN INTERVIEWED WHEN YOU DECLARE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE REGISTERED BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT. A CITIZEN THAT INFORMATION IS TRANSFERRED TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF OUR CONGRESS PEOPLE IS A MATTER OF FACT THAT. WHEN THEY'RE WORKING WITH THOUGHT UNDOCUMENTED ON TRYING TO BECOME CITIZENS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED WITH ALL THE FOCUS ON? YOU KNOW THE ORDER OUR SECURITY ETCETERA THAT THEY WILL BE TARGETED. FOR SOME SORT OF PICK UP BECAUSE THEY NOW KNOW THEY ARE ON THEIR UNDOCUMENTED BECAUSE THAT GOES TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND IT'S VERY CLEAR. ON THE FORM THAT YOU FILL OUT THAT THAT'S WHERE THE INFORMATION'S GOING. AND PRESENTLY YOU CAN JUST APPLY FOR A DRIVER'S LICENSE DOCUMENTED OR UNDOCUMENTED AND THERE'S NO INFORMATION THE GHOST ANY OTHER PLACE BUT TO THE DMB. AND I THINK JUST CHANGING A FEW OF THE QUESTIONS ON THAT ORIGINAL SCREEN. WILL PROVIDE SECRETARY OF STATE WITH THE INFORMATION THEY NEED AND CERTAINLY INSURED. PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO REGISTER CAN REGISTER IN I THINK WITH YOUR BILL TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IT DOESN'T TAKE A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT THAT'S WHERE THE MISTAKES ARE BEING MADE. IT ISN'T THE EMPLOYEES IS ACTUALLY THE FORM YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND YOU GET TWO SHOTS AT IT WHEN WHEN YOU WERE NOTIFIED. THAT YOU HAVE TO GET A NEW DRIVER'S LICENSE IN THE ENVELOPE YOU GET IS A NEW REGISTRATION FORM. IT'S QUITE LONGER THAN THE WHEN YOU PICK UP AT THE LIBRARY IN A HOUSE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON IT THERE WASN'T REQUIRED BEFORE AND THE TOP LINE IT SAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WOULD JUST SIT REGISTERED TO VOTE THIS INFORMATION WILL BE CONFIDENTIAL WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. MEANING THAT NOW YOUR DMV INFORMATION IS NOW PROVIDED TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. SO THEY'VE TRANSFERRED BACK ONTO THE SCREEN THE COMPUTER SCREEN IN I THINK JUST KIND OF TAKING THAT OFTEN GET GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY SAY I DON'T WANT TO READ STRIVE ALREADY REGISTERED. MAKING THE LANGUAGE SIMPLER IS GONNA SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN YOUR COMMITTEE WOULD HELP WITH THE GROUP OF PEOPLE SITTING AROUND SO IT'S NOT POLITICIZED. THE SE -- LET'S JUST CHANGE A FEW WORDS HERE AND THEN IT'S GOING O WORK FINE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE AREAS -- I'VE SPENT TOO MANY HOURS TAKING A LOOK AT AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DID I KINDA GET. NEWS REPRESENTED IN IT WAS STRICTLY THE WAY I ANSWERED THOSE FIRST COUPLE QUESTIONS SO IN. SO I DO SUPPORT YOUR DIRECTION IT REALLY PUTS IT WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE ALL STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS LET'S GET AS MANY PEOPLE. INTO OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN THAT'S REALLY GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY. THANK YOU CENTER AND THANK YOU CENTER WILL -- CALL FOR THE VOTE WHEN -- IT'S A QUORUM THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SERVICE CENTER LEYVA YOU HAVE THE FLOOR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. SERVER LABORS INTRODUCING HER BILL. THIS IS THE US BE -- TWO ONE ZERO AND OR THIS IS ON HEAVY DUTY -- VEHICLE INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE. SO CERTAINLY WE HAVE A FOUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY OFFERING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THINKING YOU AND YOUR FOR YOUR HARD WORK. I ALSO WANT TO THINK THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS FOR CONTINUING TO WORK SO COLLABORATIVELY WITH ME AND MY TEAM ON THIS MAJOR. MEMBERS SB TWO TEN ESTABLISHES SMOG CHECK REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. UNLIKE PERSONAL PASSENGER VEHICLES CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS TO HAVE REGULAR SMOG INSPECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING PROPERLY. THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN. APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS DRIVE ACROSS CALIFORNIA ROADS ANNUALLY AND ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THE STATE'S POOR AIR QUALITY. THE BIGGEST ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH ISSUE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND IN MANY REGIONS ACROSS OUR STATE IS THE POLLUTION FROM THE CONSTANT TRUCK TRAFFIC ON OUR STREETS AND FREEWAYS. STATEWIDE ABOUT TWELVE MILLION RESIDENTS LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT FAIL TO MEET FEDERAL CLEAN STANDARDS CLEAN AIR STANDARDS. HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS OPERATING CALIFORNIA ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY NITROGEN KNOCKS. AND 82% OF DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER PM TWO POINT FIVE A POTENTIALLY CANCER CAUSING AIR CONTAMINANT. INCREASED EXPOSURE TO THE HARMFUL AIR CONTAMINANTS PM TO FIVE AN OZONE IS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR CHRONIC HEART AND LUNG DISEASES. AND OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH IMPACTS FOR ELDERLY ADULTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD CARB CURRENTLY ADMINISTERS TO INSPECTION PROGRAMS FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. HOWEVER THESE PROGRAMS ONLY REQUIRE THE CONTROL OF EXCESSIVE SMOKE AND LACK MEASURES TO LIMIT HARMFUL EMISSIONS. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THESE PROGRAMS ARE INFREQUENTLY PERFORMED AND THEY ARE NOT COMPREHENSIVE. SB TWO TEN WOULD DIRECT CARP TO WORK IN COORDINATION WITH MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT A HEAVY DUTY INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM FOR TRUCKS. THOSE ARE TRUCKS FOURTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS OR MORE. SB TWO TEN WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH TEST PROCEDURES FOR DIFFERENT MODEL YEARS AND A MISSION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EMISSIONS CONTROL OF KNOX AND PM TWO POINT. FIVE SB TWO TEN ALSO APPLIES TO OUT OF STATE TRUCKS AND WILL HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR ARE LAW ABIDING TRUCK OWNERS AND OPERATORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OVER THE NEXT DECADE SB TWO TEN WILL ASSIST IN THE REMOVAL OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED TONS OF HARMFUL PARTICULATE MATTER WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT TO TAKING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TRUCKS. OFF THE ROADS OF CALIFORNIA. NOT ONLY WILL SB TWO TEN HELP IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND AIR QUALITY IT WILL IMPROVE THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. SB TWO TEN APPLIES SIMILAR RESPONSIBILITIES TO TRUCK OPERATORS TO MAINTAIN THEIR MISSION CONTROLS AS WE ALREADY REQUIRE IN THE CARS THAT WE DRIVE EVERY DAY. I WANT TO AGAIN THANK THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMIT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH EACH OF THEM TOGETHER TO FURTHER THIS BILL WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS ALLEN ALPS WITH THE BAY AREA QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. ENVIRONS RYAN SHOOK SHE CARD FROM CAL START. WILL BE MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU WITNESSES AND SUPPORT PLEASE WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BELL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALAN ABSENT WITH THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT I'D LIKE TO START WITH KNOWLEDGE IN THE EXCELLENT COMMENTS FROM SENATOR LABEL IN POINTING OUT THE AIR QUALITY IMPACTS OF CRITERIA POLLUTANTS IN AIR TOXICS EMITTED FROM MEDIUM AND HEAVY. DUTY TRUCKS IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW'S SMOG CHECK PROGRAM SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO FOR LIGHT DUTY CARS AND TRUCKS COULD HELP IN REDUCING THOSE OVERALL IMPACTS. AS THE SENATOR NOTED WE HAVE CLOSE TO ONE MILLION HEAVY DUTY AND MEDIUM DUTY TRUCKS OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA THE DRIVE CLOSE TO SIXTY MILLION MILES PER DAY. IN THE BAY AREA WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND TRUCKS THAT COVER CLOSE TO SEVEN MILLION MILES A DAY. THROUGH THE BAY AREA'S CARE PROGRAM AND ALSO THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITY OR PROTECTION PROGRAMS WE'VE SHOWN THAT MANY AREAS WITHIN OUR REGION AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. EXPERIENCE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS FROM AIR POLLUTION AND IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT MANY OF THESE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS ARE IN HIGH TANSPORTATION AREAS IMPACTED BY DIESEL PARTICULATE. AS AN EXAMPLE -- IN THE WEST OAKLAND AREA OVER 50% OF THE CANCER RISK -- COMES FROM THE PORT OF PORT OF OAKLAND TO AND THE HEAVY DUTY AND MEDIUM DUTY TRUCKS THAT SERVE THAT PORT OF OAKLAND. AND SO -- I IN CONCLUSION THE THE SB TWO TEN WOULD SUPPORT -- THE BAY AREA AND AND THE REST OF THE STATE IN REDUCING THE RISKS OF DIESEL POLLUTION. AND WE HIGHLY -- RECOMMEND SUPPORTING THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON IS RUNNING SHORT ON BEHALF CAL START CAL STAR IT IS A CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY CONSORTIUM. COMPRISED OF OVER TWO HUNDRED BUSINESSES NONPROFITS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IT'S BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO CELEBRATE THE TRANSPORTATION CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR FREIGHT SYSTEM. WHICH IS A MAJOR ENGINE OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY. HOWEVER THESE VEHICLES ALSO IN A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF CRITERIA POLLUTANTS INTO OUR ATMOSPHERE. MANY FEET OPERATORS THERE ARE MEMBERS SUCH AS UPS PROPERLY MAINTAIN THEIR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE FLEETS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE VEHICLE EMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STATE. TOGETHER FLEETS LIKE THESE COMPRISE MANY THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES USING SCALP USING CALIFORNIA'S FREIGHT QUARTERS WEEKLY. HOWEVER SOME FLEETS ARE GROSS POLLUTERS TO THE DETRIMENT OF OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTH THIS CREATES A DISPROPORTIONATE. EXCUSE ME THIS CREATES A COMPLETE COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR THE FLEAS WHOEVER SPOTS WILL WELL MAINTAINED EQUIPMENT ON THE BAD ACTORS ARE ABLE TO KEEP LOSING OUR COMMUNITIES THERE. THE CURRENT LACK OF SUCH SMOG CHECKS EQUATES TO AN UNFAIR TAX ON RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES AND AN UNFAIR TAX ON COMMUNITY MEMBERS LONGS. SB TWO CHANNEL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD ACROSS THE COMMERCIAL TRUCK OPERATORS BY ENSURING THAT EVERYONE IS HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO VEHICLE EMISSIONS. IT ACTUALLY HELPED MANY FLEETS BY STOPPING LOWER AND OPERATORS THAT POLLUTING VEHICLES FROM UNDERCUTTING THE PROFESSIONAL WELL MAINTAINED VEHICLE OPERATIONS. SB TO DENNIS DENNIS SENSIBLE WAY IT'S MEANT TO BE A LIGHT TOUCH REGULATORY SYSTEM EVEN LATER THAN A CAR SMOG CHECK. AND IS THAT A STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR FLEAS THAT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED COMPLIANCE HISTORY. CARLA ALTERNATELY HAVE TO DETERMINE THE PROCESS THROUGH RULE MAKING A PROCESS THAT WOULD INCLUDE REGULATED PARTISAN SELVES TO TO BE A PART OF NO FLEET OPERATORS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CIRCUMVENT STATE VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS. AND SB TWO TEN IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO ENSURING PARITY ACROSS ALL INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS IN SOUND THE BILL PROVIDES A WORKABLE COMMONSENSE APPROACH PRETENDING DOWN ACROSS COMPUTERS. BOB WHAT DO YOU NEED FOR MEASURES THAT CREATE UNNECESSARY RED TAPE. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OF WE HAVE OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO ADD ON IBM'S CHAIRMAN BILL MCADAMS CHOLISH FOR CLEAN AIR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER PEOPLE PLEASE.

THIS WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET EVERYBODY THE SUPPORTS THE BILL FIRST. SO THE OTHER THE OTHER SUPPORTERS HERE TODAY OKAY -- OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME. FOR YEAH HE CAN COME UP IF HE WANTS OVER [inaudible] MAYBE RIGHT. A ROMAN WITH THE CALVARY TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ON AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THEM OVER SAY CONCERNS AND COST EFFECTIVENESS AND DUPLICATE REGULATION. CITY AND ITS MEMBERS. DO NOT OPPOSE NEW INSPECTION ON OUR EQUIPMENT. TO THE CONTRARY WE BELIEVE THAT INSPECTIONS DONE WELL -- IN REMOVING DUPLICATION WILL HELP THOSE TRUCKING COMPANIES WHO HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY IN NEW EQUIPMENT AGAINST THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO REFUSE TO COMPLY. WITH STATE REGULATIONS. HOWEVER WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE P. THIRTY THIS BILL PROVIDES CARP. CARP IS STILL IN THE COURSE OF DESIGNING THEIR HEAVY DUTY SMOG CHECK PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF THE COST OF THE REGULATION WILL BURY DEPENDING ON DECISIONS CARP STAFF AND THE BOARD HAVE YET TO MAKE WE CANNOT SUPPORT HANDING OVER A BLANK CHECK TO THE AGENCY. THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY ALREADY INVEST APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. TO COMPLY WITH CARP RULES. TO DATE CARP IS LEVIED NO FEES TO IMPLEMENT THESE RULES. IF NEW THE AUTHORITIES TO BE GRANTED CAR MUST DISCLOSE WHY THE FEES REASONABLE AND NECESSARY AND THAT THERE AND WHY THEIR PROGRAM COSTS ARE JUSTIFIED. TO DATE DESPITE DISCUSSING THE CONCEPT FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS. NO COST ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO STAKEHOLDERS TO JUSTIFY THE FEE -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE SENATOR -- BUT AT THIS TIME WE ARE STILL POSE LESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THE WITNESS PLEASE YES. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST AN OLD FIELD WITH THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION I TO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE FOR WORKING WITH US -- AND IN NOT TRYING TO BE REDUNDANT WITH WITH WHAT'S IN THE ANALYSIS BECAUSE AS THE ANALYSIS DOES STATE -- SEVERAL AMENDMENTS WILL BE MADE TO ADDRESS -- CONCERNS -- THAT WERE BROUGHT FORWARD BY OUR COALITION I DO WANNA QUICKLY FOCUS ON ONE SPECIFIC. ISSUE THAT I BELIEVE IS IS OUTSTANDING AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FIX THE TICKET COMPONENT. OF THE BILL AND AND PROVIDING A CERTAIN TIME FRAME FOR AN OPERATOR TO CORRECT A VIOLATION -- AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS NOTES THAT -- AT LEAST IN OUR OPINION FROM AGRICULTURE THAT THAT THAT WINDOW SHOULD BE NINETY DAYS. AND WE THINK THAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE AND A REASONABLE REQUEST -- AND A GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT REFLECTS A SORT OF A VERY BUSY TIMES DURING OUR PLANNING AND HARVESTING SEASONS -- THAT WE THAT THAT WE SEE IN CLIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND I I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE QUICK EXAMPLE AND IT'S MORE THE LIVESTOCK SIDE GIVEN WHO I REPRESENT BUT LIVE SOCCER PRIMARILY MOVE TWICE A YEAR -- IN THE IN THE SPRING -- ERECTION STARTING IT RIGHT NOW -- WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LIVESTOCK THAT ARE MOVED -- FROM FROM WINTER WINTER PASTURE TO SUMMER PASTURE AND AGAIN IN THE FALL BACK TO SUMMER POWER TO WINNER PRESSURE IN THOSE CATTLE ARE MARKETED DURING THOSE PERIODS. AND THEY ROUGHLY RUN FOR ABOUT NINETY DAYS AND THAT'S IN THE SPRING AND THE FALL WE CALL THE SCREEN FALL RUN -- AND WE ALREADY HAVE A VERY STE WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF TRUCKS SPECIFICALLY LIVESTOCK COLLEGE IN THE STATE. SO WE DO HAVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF TRUCKS THAT COME INTO A SYSTEM THAT NINETY DAY WINDOW. AND IF WE WERE TO LOSE TRUCKS DURING THAT NINETY DAY WINDOW BECAUSE OF A FIX A TICKET THAT WAS ONLY AT FORTY FIVE DAYS WE WOULD HAVE CONSIDERABLE -- ISSUES WITH MAKING UP THAT CAPACITY AND THAT'S I THINK ONE GOOD EXAMPLE MY WE REQUEST THAT THAT NINETY DAY FIX IT -- TICKET WINDOW SO THIS ISSUE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK -- WITH THE AUTHOR AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. OF OTHER PEOPLE OPPOSING THE BILL PLEASE YEAH -- GOOD AFTERNOON MICROBES IN THE I'M HERE ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION IF YOU JUST INDULGE ME FOR A SECOND SENATOR I WE ARE NOT PRIVATE FLEETS WERE NOT -- COMMERCIAL OPERATORS OF FLEETS WE WE WITH THIS IS THE THE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ARE REGULATED UNDER CARP THROUGH -- SOMETHING CALLED THE PUBLIC AGENCIES AND UTILITIES. THAT RICK FLEET REGULATION FOR PROBABLY EACH SEASON UTILITIES AND AND THROUGH THAT REGULATION THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE THEIR FLEETS REQUIRED HAVE BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY IN ALL THEIR OTHER HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. AND WE'RE SIMPLY WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S A MEMBERS GOING IN FOR THE PRIVATE OPERATORS ABOUT DUPLICATIVE REGULATIONS IN. IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE ENTERTAINING TO PUT THE IDEA OF DUPLICATIVE REGULATIONS ARE STRAW THAT THROUGH THE PUBLIC FLEETS IN THERE AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO TO NOT OVER REGULATE THE PUBLIC FLEETS WHICH IS ONLY GONNA BECAUSE YOUR UTILITY RATES AND OTHER RATES YOU PAY AS UP. AS TAXPAYERS TO YOUR PUBLICATIONS HE'S TO GO UP SO THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON WELL CREAMERS CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION -- WE SHARE THE CONCERNS OF ALL ALREADY BEEN EXPRESSED AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS.

MR JR MEMBERS BREDERODE UNITED CONTRACTORS IN THE WESTERN LIKE INSTRUCTORS AND WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO RECOGNIZE THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- ARE BEING WORKED THROUGH AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. I'M IN THE RIGHT LINE. YOU'RE YOU'RE GOOD -- ROBINSON ENTERPRISES OPPOSE. OKAY THANK YOU. CHARLIE RAY CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION DUSTER MATERIALS ASSOCIATION OPPOSING UNTIL WE SEE THAT MEN'S [inaudible] OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON FRIENDS ROSS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY POST ONCE AMENDED. JUST LIKE TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS FOR THOSE OF SENIOR WAY THANK OKAY -- OKAY ANY OTHER OF OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL OKAY SEEN ON PERHAPS THE ISSUES RACE WITH THE OPPOSITION RESPONDED. TO SO WE HAVE -- CENTER LABOR ALL TURN OVER YOU AND YOUR WITNESSES PERHAPS BEEN. RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED. I HEARD -- ABSOLUTELY. PLEASE THE COURT. INPUT FROM -- PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY THE YOU'LL FEES AND THE SIX A TICKET ISSUE ABSOLUTELY OKAY SO I WOULD FIRST ARE WITH THE THE FEE OF FORTY AND AND THAT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING A BIG CONCERN TO FOLKS WHICH IT IS TO US AS WELL -- THERE CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE A BLANK CHECK THAT IS HANDED OVER TO CARB -- WHAT WE'RE WAITING FOR QUITE FRANKLY IS TO GET -- TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS WHERE WILL HAVE A MORE DETAILED FISCAL ANALYSIS. I COULD GIVE YOU A NUMBER I COULD PULL SOMETHING OUT OF THE AIR AND JUST GAS BUT WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GET WE COME UP WITH THE PROPER FEE. SO WE ARE COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO WORKING ON IT BUT AGAIN THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE WE ARE LOOKING TO GET THOSE ANSWERS WHEN WE GET TO SENATE IF WE ARE LUCKY ENOUGH. TO GET TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS -- AS FAR AS THE FORTY FIVE DAYS VERSUS THE NINETY DAYS WE'RE 1100% COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS ISSUE WE IN NO WAY WANT ANY ANIMALS TO DIE WE WANT NO FRUITS OR VEGETABLES TO ROT. I AM SO CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN FIND A WAY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE -- I JUST AGAIN ONE THINK THE STATE HOLE STAKEHOLDERS -- AND MY STAFF THIS IS OUR THIRD YEAR WITH THIS BILL AND WE TRY TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL I LIKE TO SAY TO PEOPLE THAT -- WHEN YOU'RE NEGOTIATING IF EVERYBODY WALKS AWAY A LITTLE BIT UNHAPPY EVERY WALKS WITH A LITTLE BIT HAPPY THEN WE DID OUR JOB WE ARE NOT TRYING TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS HERE [inaudible] OKAY. WE HAVE THE WITNESSES SO CAN YOU DRESS THE FEES ISSUE HOW DO YOU DO THAT [inaudible] THE CARD. WHAT DO YOU BASE IT ON COST RECOVERY OR? IS THERE A WELL OUR THE OUT OUR THIS OUT HOW WILL. THOSE. IT'S OF COURSE. PEOPLE WHAT WOULD WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT BUT ONE I'M NOT SURE I'M THE BEST PERSON ANSWER THIS QUESTION WORKING FOR THE FOR THE BAY AREA AIR DISTRICT IN NOT CARB BUT BUT I WOULD JUST LOOK AT IT SIMILAR -- TO THE EXISTING LAWS SMOG CHECK PROGRAM FOR FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES IN IN THAT THERE IS A OR A SIMILAR TYPES -- COST RECOVERY KIND OF THING RIGHT YES SIR I THINK IT IS YEAH IT IS [inaudible] THE SIR DODD HAD A QUESTION. THERE MEMBERS OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE THE AUTHOR -- FOR YEAH WORKING WITH THE YEAH PEOPLE THAT HAD SOME CONCERNS ON THIS BILL AYE AYE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS -- YOU KNOW MORE WORK TO DO OTHER THAN COST RECOVERY I I I LOOK AT THIS THING WE WE HEARD TONIGHT FAIR TAX -- ON PEOPLE'S LAWNS AND I AGREE WITH THAT -- IT'S NOT FAIR TAX ON RESPONSIBLE TRUCK OWNERS. AND I GUESS YEAH WHAT WE'VE DONE -- THROUGH OUR PROGRAMS WHICH ARE RIGHT AND JUST LOOK AT WE GOTTA GET CLEAN AIR IN THE STATE AND-SO WHAT WE'VE DONE. IS WE FORCE TRUCKING COMPANIES. TO REALLY GO THE EXTRA MILE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY BUY A NEW VEHICLES WHILE WE'VE BEEN ALLOWING OTHER VEHICLES TO COME IN AND THE POLLUTE THE AIR SO ONCE AGAIN WHAT MY BIGGEST CONCERN HERE IS ONCE AGAIN. THE RESPONSIBLE TRUCK OWNERS. ARE GETTING TAXED. AND ALSO WHAT I SEE IS YOU I USED TO OWN -- PROBABLY THE OVER TWENTY MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. AND WHEN YOU BUY A NEW VEHICLES -- PRESUMABLY YOU'RE PARTICULARLY IN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THIS STARTS. BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IDEA AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DURATION OF THE TIME PERIOD IS -- EVEN WITH CARS THESE DAYS HOW OFTEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE DONE BUT WITH THE NEW TRUCKS WITH THE NEW FILTERS AND EVERYTHING THEY HAVE -- THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BUYING A NEWER TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE GRANDFATHERED IN IT SEEMS TO ME MAYBE THAT'S YOUR BILL I DID NOT READ THAT -- YOU KNOW IN IN IN IN THE ANALYSIS. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- THIS IS A SMALL CHECK IT'S NOT A TAX SO IT'S LIKE YOU AND I WHEN WE TAKE OUR VEHICLES -- EVERY YEAR EVERY OTHER YEAR DEPENDING ON THE MAKE AND MODEL AND THE YEAR OF OUR CAR WE TAKE IT IN TO GET A SMOG EMISSIONS TEST. WHEN WE FOUND OUT A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT ARE BIG DIESEL TRUCKS THAT ARE ON THE ROADS MORE THAN WE TRAVEL AS PASSENGER CARS -- DAY IN AND DAY OUT YOU HEARD OVER A MILLION MILES ON A TRAVERSE OUR ROADS EACH YEAR I THOUGHT WELL IT DOESN'T SEEM UNREASONABLE TO ASK. BIG RIGS TO DO THE SAME THE EACH AND EVERYONE OF US TO WITH OUR PASSENGER VEHICLES. SO THE THE BILL CURRENTLY REQUIRES THE A. R. B. TO ESTABLISH DIFFERENT TESTING PROCEDURES AND A REQUIREMENT FOR DIFFERENT MODEL YEARS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE STANDARDS AND THE CAP THE CAPABILITIES OF NEWER AND OLDER MODELS. SO IF YOU'RE IN A NEWER TRUCK. I I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT TO BE YOU MIGHT NEED A SMOG CHECK EVERY OTHER YEAR LIKE WHEN YOU DRIVE A NEWER CAR NOW I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE NEWEST CARS AT A MINUTE THE LOWEST. MICHAEL A FEW YEARS WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE A SMOG CHECK THIS WOULD BE SIMPLEST BILL WOULD BE SIMILAR FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. THE BILL ALSO CURRENTLY ALLOWS FOR STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR TRUCKS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED HISTORY OF BEING WELL MAINTAINED. CURRENTLY THE AIR BE AN INDUSTRY ARE EXPLORING WAYS TO ALLOW WELL MAINTAINED FLEET TO CONSISTENTLY REPORT ON TIME. TO DECREASE THE FREQUENCY OF TESTING TO EVERY OTHER YEAR INSTEAD OF EVERY YEAR OR JUST SIMPLY SUBMIT DATA IN LIEU OF OPACITY TESTING FOR ENGINES TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OR NEWER. WE INTEND THIS BILL TO TRACK WITH THOSE FLEXIBILITY AS IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT COMMERCIAL TRUCKS ARE DRIVING A LOT MORE MILES AND MORE POLLUTING THE RANK OF REGULAR VEHICLES IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. SO INCREASE SMOG CHECK FREQUENCY AS NECESSARY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD WHEN WE INITIALLY INTRODUCES BILL A COUPLE YEARS AGO AS WELL WHAT WE DO WITH THE OUT OF STATE TRACKS WE CAN DO ALL THIS GREAT WORK IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WHAT WE DO NGUYEN TRUCKS COME IN FROM OTHER STATES. THEY WILL HAVE TO HAVE A PERMIT TO OPERATE THEY WILL HAVE TO GET A SMOG CHECK AS WELL SO WE THINK THAT THAT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD FOR THE TRUCKERS. AND THE TRUCK DRIVERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND A LOOK MEANS THE BAD ACTORS OUT OF STATE WILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS AS WELL I HOPE THAT. SOMEHOW I I THINK IT DOES I I GUESS WHAT I'LL DO IS I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I RESERVE THE RIGHT ON THE FLOOR THIS IS AND TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS -- TO YOUR OPPOSE THE BILL BOERNER HORVATH THANK YOU SENATOR DODD. SIR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR. GRATEFUL IN WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO AT THE SENATOR FOR ALL OF HER WORK ON THIS AND ME MY STAKEHOLDERS -- IN TWO WE HAD OPPORTUNITY JEEP GRATEFUL THAT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU BEFORE COMMITTEE AS WELL SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME. I'D LIKE TO BE A TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE IN REGARDS TO FEES AND THE PILOT PROJECT. SO BY THE PROJECT. COMES BUT I'D SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY MODELING YOUR FEES OFF OF WHAT CARB. MAYBE RECOMMENDING CORRECT. THE OUT AND THEN WILL WE FIND OUT AND SEND APPROPRIATIONS WHEN WE HAVE A MORE FISCAL ANALYSIS OKAY SO ALL. EIGHT EIGHT I THINK THAT THE ANY TIME. WHETHER IT'S AN INDUSTRY OR FAMILY -- DOESN'T HAVE DEFINITION THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE NERVOUSNESS. IN ESPECIALLY COMING OUT OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE RETROFITS -- IN THE PURCHASE NEW EQUIPMENT THERE'S REAL CONCERN SO NOW THAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THAT IN WANTING TO BETTER BRING DEFINITION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE YOU WINE COMMENTING ON THAT A LITTLE BIT NOT AT ALL THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO GETTING THE FEE STRUCTURE TAKING CARE OF LIKE I SAID EARLIER I THINK THAT TAT'S BETTER SUITED FOR A FISCAL PA FISCAL COMMITTEE LIKE APPROPRIATIONS IF WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY -- AND I COULD JUST PULL A NUMBER OUT BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT IT MIGHT BE TOO LOW IT MIGHT BE TOO HIGH WE REALLY WANT TO DO A GOOD FISCAL ANALYSIS. AND AND OF COURSE WAS LOOKING TO GET THE LOWEST FEE TO COVER THE COST OF THE PROGRAM. HI THIS IS NOT A MONEY MAKING PROGRAM THIS IS STRICTLY BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COST OF THE PROGRAM IS COVERED BUT WE ARE WE HAVE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR THAT THAT IS A CONCERN TO FOLKS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. IN THE LAST PIECE IS ON FIXING TICKETS AND JUST WANTING TO TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE MAY BE A SWEET SPOT AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN THE MOUTH. BETWEEN FORTY FIVE IN THE NINETY IN IN TRYING TO CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE ON THAT AND CAN HIS COMMENT ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. YET WE ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO FINDING THAT SWEET SPOT -- BUT LIKE I SAID WE DO NOT WANT ANY ANIMALS TO DIE ON THE ROAD IF SOMEONE GETS PULLED OVER AND HAVE A FIX THE TICKET WE WANT THEM TO CONTINUE. TO FINISH THAT LOAD -- ALSO WITH -- FRUITS VEGETABLES WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD SO WE DON'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY HARM TO PEOPLE AND I AGREE I THINK I ABSOLUTELY THINK BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SUCH A PRODUCTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. THAT WE CAN FIND THE SWEET SPOT AND FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE IN MY LAST QUESTION ON THAT SWEET SPOT AT WHICH IS VERY TECHNICAL. IS -- DO YOU HOPE TO HAVE THAT PRIOR TO APPROPRIATIONS OR IT CONTINUE TO WORK ON A JUST WHAT WHAT YOUR IDEAS YEAH I MEAN WE CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ON A VERY FREQUENT BASIS -- WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO BUT WE WANT TO DO IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO LOOK I I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS IN AND I WILL STOP THE GOOD TWENTY QUESTIONS OF THE GOOD SENATOR -- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE THERE HAVE BEEN -- AND I THINK THE ANALYSIS EVEN POINTED THIS OUT RIGHT. THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS WE SEEN MORE AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT. AND A NARROWING OF THE BILL AND AND MORE OF A FOCUS -- IN TRYING TO BE ABLE TO IRON THOSE ISSUES OUT THEY JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU -- AS THIS IS A BIG -- ONE YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SENATORS WELL. UNDERSTANDING THAT SHE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON BOTH ALL ISSUES A FIX IT TICKETS AS WELL AS ON THE FEE STRUCTURE WILL OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT THAT HERE TODAY TO ALLOW THOSE CONVERSATIONS. TO CONTINUE WITH AND I ALSO KNOW THAT SHE'S HEARD AS YOU DO SAID LOUD AND CLEAR THAT NEED TO BE A FIGURE THAT OUT AND BRING SOME FROM THIS TO THAT SO. DISTRICT GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND LOOK FOR HAVING FOR THEIR CONVERSATION THANK YOU CERTAINLY THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE. OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM SENATORS SERVICE STUFF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND CENTER LEAVE -- I I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS WITH HIS BILL I'M. I STILL GOT SOME CONCERNS -- ESPECIALLY WITH -- TRUCKS THAT ARE COMING FROM OUT OF STATE -- ALL TAKE WALMART IT IS AS AN EXAMPLE A LOT OF THEIR TRUCKS ORIGINALLY FROM BENTONVILLE ARKANSAS. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN A LOCAL -- REGULATIONS AND LICENSORS THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE -- TO BYE BYE -- THEY'RE DOING COMMERCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE CLAUSE OF THE US CONSTITUTION THAT WERE IMPEDING THEIR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND LET'S SAY THAT -- YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY CAN DO THIS IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS LAW ON THEM I MEAN ARE YOU GOING TO CYNICAL TALKTALK OUT THERE THEY KEEP. COMING INTO THE STATE AND THIS WILL BE OUR LAWS I MEAN IS IS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU HAVE COMPANIES FROM OUTSIDE THE US STATE CALIFORNIA'S KERRY'S ARE. YOU PLANNING FOR SICKNESS ABSOLUTELY SO WE KNOW THAT TRUCKS HOW THAT ARE GOING TO BE DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THERE FROM OUT OF STATE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PERMIT TO OPERATE. IF THIS BILL PASSES AND BECOMES LAW THEY WILL HAVE TO DO A SMOG CHECK BEFORE THEY CAN GET THEIR PERMIT TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S HOW WE WILL DO IT IF THEY COME IN THEY GET PULLED OVER NO PERMIT TO OPERATE THEN THEY'RE IN TROUBLE AND THEY GET. SENT BACK OUT. SOUNDS SIMPLE I'M SURE IT WILL BE QUITE THAT SIMPLE NOTHING EVER IS BUT IT SHOULD BE JUST THAT EASY. WE KNOW HOW MANY CITATIONS ARE AT NEW YEAR FOR TRUCKS OR NOT. I HAVE REQUIRED INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA HAVE NO IDEA THE CALIFORNIA DESERT ERUPT -- I HAVE NO IDEA I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT MANY THAT THEIR ANALYZE PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS THAT THERE IS NOT A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT EVEN AND WHAT. IS DONE NOW TO TRY AND FIND THE BAD ACTORS SO THIS IS TRYING TO BRING SOME REGULATION TO THE GOOD AT FOR THE GOOD ACTORS TO THE BAD ACTORS. OKAY AND THEN THE FOLLOW UP THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- IN MY REPORT SAYS THAT -- WE SUBJECT HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES TO REGULAR INSPECTION EMISSION CONTROLS -- THE CALIFORNIA HEAVY DUTY INSPECTION PROGRAM ALLOWS CARBON INSPECTION TEAMS TO CONDUCT RANDOM INSPECTIONS FOR EXCESSIVE SMOKE -- VEHICLES TRAVELING TO CALIFORNIA'S ALSO HEAR ME CALIFORNIA'S EMISSION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS OR OBTAIN AN EMISSION CONTROL LABEL SO. HOW IS THIS NOT A DUPLICATION OF THE EFFORTS ALREADY UNDERWAY BY BY CAR? DOES NOW IS NOT A SMOG CHECK THIS WOULD REQUIRE EVERY VEHICLE HAS A SMOG CHECK AT SOME POINT IN THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IS VERY RANDOM AND I WILL SAY RANDOM WITH THE CAPITAL ARE -- IT DOES NOT HAPPEN VERY OFFICE SO YOU'VE GOT A FEW TRUCKS THAT MIGHT BE CHECKED WORDS WITH THIS PROGRAM EVERY TRUCK WILL HAVE TO PASS AT A SMALL TEST. OKAY WELL APPROVED THANK YOU A APPRECIATED WORKING CLOSELY WITH. THE OPPOSITION AND MCCARTY TO CONTINUE TO DO SO THANK YOU WILL DO THANK YOU SIR -- THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM SENATORS. OKAY CENTER YOU HAVE THE FLOOR FOR CLOTHES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION AND I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW GROWING UP IN CHINO IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHICH IS WHEN THE CITY'S I REPRESENT. TODAY ARE GROWING UP THERE IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES AS A VERY LITTLE GIRL THERE ARE MANY DAYS WHEN WE COULDN'T SEE THE MOUNTAINS WHEN I WAS IN GRADE SCHOOL THERE WERE DAYS WHEN WE HAD SMOG ALERTS HARD CHEST HER WE COULDN'T PLAY OUTSIDE WE HAD TO STAY INDOORS. NOW WE SEE THE MOUNTAINS MORE OFTEN WE HAVE LESS SMOG ALERTS SO OVER THE YEARS PRIOR TO ME EVER COMING TO THE SENATE. PEOPLE HAVE DONE GOOD WORK TO MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEANING UP OUR AIR QUALITY THE PROBLEM TODAY IS THAT THE PARTICULAR ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THEY USED TO BE SO EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY DAY WE HAVE SOME OF THE WORST AIR POLLUTION. IN THE COUNTRY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FAIR ABOUT WHO IS -- IS WHO IS BEING -- WHO IS -- ACTUALLY MAKING SURE AIR QUALITY IS -- IT'S CLEAN WE ALL DO SMALL CHECKS EVERY YEAR OR EVERY OTHER YEAR ON OUR CARS MAYBE LONGER IF YOU HAVE A VERY NEW CAR. ASKING THE TRUCKERS WHO PUT CAN POTENTIALLY -- POLLUTE THE MOST SUBMIT THEM TO A SMOG CHECK AS WELL WE THINK IS FAIR. MAKING SURE THAT ARE OUT OF STATE FOLKS THAT ARE COMING IN AND OUT APPLIED TO THE THESE APPLY TO THEM AS WELL WE FEELS VERY FAIR. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE FOLKS CAN CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS CLEAN AIR TO BREATHE.

SHE HAS -- HER BILL SP. FOUR NINETY EIGHT THREE QUARTERS AND PROVEN FUNDS THE GRANT PROGRAM SHORT LINE RAILROADS. AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR AND SHE WILL MAKE HER PRESENTATION -- SO THIS I'M. FOURTEEN ON OUR AGENDA CENTER YOU HAVE THE FOR GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- I PRESENT SB FOUR NINE EIGHT THE THE SHORTLINE RAILROAD IMPROVEMENT ACT. A A BILL TO SUPPORT RAILROAD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN OUR STATE. OF BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED OF PROPOSITION ONE BE EIGHTY TWENTY BILLION BOND ACT. THAT ACT INCLUDED TWO MILLION TO ESTABLISH A TRADE CORRIDORS IMPROVEMENT FUND TO ADDRESS HIGH VOLUME OF FREIGHT MOVEMENT. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA STATE RAIL PLAN IN BOUND AN OUT. AND OUT BOUND AFRAID -- RAIL TRAFFIC IN CALIFORNIA IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY MILLION TONS BY. TWENTY FORTY WITH THAT PROJECTED GROWTH COMES INCREASES AND TRUCK TRAFFIC AND FREIGHT BOTTLENECKS WITH WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN EMISSIONS UNLESS MORE IS DONE TO REHABILITATE THE SHORTLINE RAIL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. THE PLAN ALSO IDENTIFIED THAT WE COULD INCREASE RELIABILITY AND EFFICIENCY TO THE ENTIRE STATEWIDE RAIL WOULD RAIL ROAD NETWORK IF WE DIRECTED FUNDING FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. SB FOUR NINE EIGHT BUILDS ON UP THE PLANS RECOMMENDATION TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND CONSTRUCTION UP PROJECTS TO UPGRADE THE STATE WIDE SHORTLINE RAIL ROAD NETWORK. IMPROVING SHORTLINE INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE TRACK RAIL AND SPURS AFFORDS LOCALIZED IN STATEWIDE ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND CONNECTS OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES TO MORE RESOURCES. SB FOUR NINE EIGHT WILL KEEP CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE BY INCENTIVIZING SHORT LINE RAILROADS TO INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE ABOVE AND BEYOND THEIR CURRENT ME IN SCHEDULES WITH AN OPPORTUNITY. TO RECEIVE GRANT FUNDING. WITH ME TODAY IS TRAFFIC SHOCK ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR A CHEN CN WYOMING AND PHILIPPE IT WENT AS WITH THE APEX GROUP BOTH CAN. HELP EXPLAIN SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT IS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE RAIL PLAN. THANK YOU CENTER -- WE HAVE THE WITNESSES IN FAVOR. THIRD A BELL A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JEFF AND SHAKEN I'M THE USES A VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR JANICE IN WYOMING IN OUR SIX OBSERVE YOUR SHORT LINE RAILROADS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M HERE TODAY I WAS IN SUPPORT OF US BEFORE NINETY EIGHT WANT. TO THANK CENTER HER DAUGHTER FOR HER FOR SIDE -- WITH THIS LEGISLATION -- IN CALIFORNIA SHORELINES OPERATOR POSSIBLY 25% OF THE RAIL NETWORK AND MOVE ABOUT 11% OF THE TOTAL FOR A TRAFFIC THE SHORELINES EXIST TO SERVE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE TRACK WAS HELD BY PREVIOUS OWNERS BUT SPOT OFF DUE. TO A LACK OF CUSTOMER VOLUME OR INEFFICIENCY IN RAIL ROUTING AS RESULT THE SPOT A FAST THAT SUFFERED YEARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND AN ACTIVE MARKETING MITCHELL AND REAL COMPANIES LIKE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY RAILROAD BOUGHT THESE UNDERPERFORM BRANCH LINES TO REVITALIZE THEM ALLOWING RURAL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AND CUSTOMERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR ACCESS TO THE NATIONAL FREIGHT RAIL NETWORK. I THINK THE CALIFORNIA STATE RAIL PLAN SAYS IT REALLY WELL ON PAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT AND I QUOTE. THE PRINCIPLE CHALLENGE THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IS THAT SOME OF THE STATE'S SHORELINE TRACKAGE CANNOT HANDLE FREIGHT CARS WAY TO AN EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND POUNDS. A STANDARDTHAT CLASS ONE RAILROADS ADOPTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR OR LINE IS NOT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND POUND CAPABLE THE COMMON PRACTICE IS TO EITHER LOAD A REAL CAR TO LESS THAN ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY. OR TO TRANSFER THE TRANSFER THE LOW TWO TRUCKS FOR TRANSPORT TO A LOCATION WHERE THE RAILROAD CAN HANDLE THE HAVE YOUR LOAD. BUT PRACTICES UNNECESSARILY INCREASED COSTS THROUGH THE INEFFICIENT USE OF ASSETS THE ADDITIONAL STEPS REQUIRED AND THE ADDITIONAL TRAVEL TIME. THIRTY THREE OTHER STATES. IN THE COUNTRY HAVE PROGRAMS DEDICATED TOWARD FUNDING SHORTLINE RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP IMPROVE THE ASSETS AND KEEP THEM AT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND POUNDS AND ALLOW THEM TO MOVE SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY. IN CALIFORNIA I THINK WE SEE SUCH BENEFITS LIKE IMPROVED AIR QUALITY THROUGH FEWER TRUCKS ON THE CALIFORNIA ROADWAYS. OF YOUR TRUCKS WAS ON LESS ROADWAY CONGESTION AND IMPROVE HIGHWAY SAFETY. OF THIS BILL WOULD SERVE A DIVERSE BASE OF AGRICULTURAL MANUFACTURING SECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY THAT NEED SHORELINES TO REACH THEIR DESTINATION IT'LL PROVIDE IMPROVE TRANSPORTATION CONNECTIVITY THERE'S THE STATES THAT ARE OFTEN RURAL AND LEFT WITH FEW. OPTIONS FOR GOODS MOVEMENT TO APPRECIATE CONSIDERATION OF THIS -- BILL AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS THANK CHAIRMAN BILL FLEET A POINT IS AVOCATE FOR TENNESSEE IN WYOMING I WANT TO THANK SENATOR COURT BATTLE AND OBVIOUSLY YOU YOUR COMMITTEE IN YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF. SENATOR FOR ENTERTAINING THIS MEASURE TODAY -- I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF FOLKS MAY HAVE BUT REALLY THIS IS A A SIMPLE MEASURE THAT BUILT ON OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STATERAIL PLAN IN THAT LEVERAGES ALL OF THE STRENGTHS OF THAT PLAN WITH SOME OF THE LOW HANGING FRUIT. HEARING CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS A SHORTLINE RAIL INDUSTRY AND SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OF ANYBODY HAVE AS AN OF OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR OF THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. OKAY MISTER CHAIR I I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT. MY APOLOGIES FOR THE LATE INTRODUCTION OF OUR SUPPORT LETTER BUT THERE'S A COALITION OF SIXTEEN COMPANIES AND SHIPPERS WHO -- FILED THEIR LATE SUPPORT ALBEIT A FOR FOR THE MEASURE IN IN YOUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANT HOUSE THANK YOU -- WITNESSES OPPOSING THIS BILL ANY WITNESSES OPPOSING. ONE PERSON COME FORWARD [inaudible] WELCOME. AND THE OTHER [inaudible] FOR THE COMMISSION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- TO ME CAN REPRESENT IS SAYING YOU'RE VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS AND ALSO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS. ONE THING IS NOT BEEN SERVED ABOUT THE BILLS WERE ARE THE FUNDS COMING FROM. THE BILL PROPOSES TO TAKE. WHAT WE CALL COST SAVINGS FROM THE? TO SHOW YOUR PROGRAM. WHICH CURRENTLY OVER THIRTEEN YEARS TOTAL THIRTEEN YEARS. HAVE ROTATED BACK TO PROJECT SPONSORS. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONSENSUS GROUP. WHICH IS MADE UP OF THE FOR COUNTIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE HAVE COST SAVINGS WHICH WE HAVE HAD COST SAVINGS OVER THE YEARS WE BRING IT BACK TO OUR? MEMBERS -- COUNTIES WHICH INCLUDES LA. RIVERSIDE ORANGE COUNTY IN SEPTEMBER AND YOU KNOW. AND UNDER THE GUIDELINES AND UNDER STATE LAW. WE HAVE TO USE THOSE PHONES FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. WITHIN OR WHO IS WHAT THEY CALL THE SUB -- ALLOCATION REGIONS OR NO FOUR BY STATE LAW. HI I HAVE A OF A PARTICULAR. SITUATION WAS. UNSINKABLE VALLEY WHERE IF THIS BILL IS TO PASS. WE POTENTIALLY WILL PROBABLY LOSE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. FROM EXISTING THREE REASONS WHICH WOULD IMPACT FOR THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE SENATOR RUBIO. THERE WOULD REALLY SUPPORT OUR ABILITY TO DO A VERY IMPORTANT A GRADE SEPARATION PROJECT -- IN HER ACCOUNT AND HER JUST RIGHT ARM. WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE THREE ROW PLANNED SALES WE DON'T DISAGREE WERE SHORT ONE RIVER ROAD. IN THE NEW FOCUS ON EDGE WE DO SO HAVE A MAJOR MERGER SURE THESE FUNDS ARE COMING FROM. CURRENTLY THE CTC IS WORKING WITH ALL THE TO SHOW YOURSELF SPONSORED HELD USE. TO DETERMINE WHEN WE ARE GOING TO CUT OFF THE TEE SHOWING OF PROGRAM. CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW UNDER THE GUIDELINES OF THE COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED. THE PROGRAM WOULD END IN JUNE OF NEXT YEAR OR AND I WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE. TO AT LEAST IF WE HAVE WHERE. THE THE CITY SHE'S LOOKING AT EXTENDING THE PROGRAM. TO JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY WE CHECK IF WE WERE TO ALLOW THE CITY TO SEE THE ABILITY TO MARKET THE POLICY. AND DETERMINE IF TWENTY TWENTY YEARS THAT NEW DROP DEAD DATE. THEN WE COULD YOU KNOW. BASICALLY IN THE TEACHER PROGRAM IF WE HAVE COST SAVINGS THE LEGISLATURE COULD GO AHEAD AND RE PROGRAMMING FOR OTHER WERE YOU PROJECTS. OKAY THANK YOU SIR -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN IN OPPOSITION. OKAY -- TO HAVE QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE -- PERHAPS WE CAN RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS PEOPLE OUT ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT IS THE MEMBERS THE COUPLE OF THINGS YEAR EXCELLENT ANALYSIS OF POINTS OUT THAT THE FUNDING FOR THIS GRANT PROGRAM COMES FROM THE CDC WITH GUIDELINES PRESCRIBED BY THE CDC SO TO THE CONCERNS -- AND WE'RE HAPPY TO MEET WITH THE OPPOSITION ALBEIT IT IT'S LATE AND I THINK IT'S PART OF THE DEADLINE WEEK HERE BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO DISCUSS SORT OF HOW TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT I THINK WHAT'S CLEAR IN THE ANALYSIS IS THAT THE CDC IS INSTRUCTED TO COME UP WITH THE GUIDELINES AND IF THERE ARE ALLOCATION FORMULAS. THAT HAVE TO BE HONORED -- EVEN THOUGH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ALLOCATED PROGRAMMATIC SAVINGS THEN I THINK. WE'RE ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO IT -- BUT I I I DON'T SEE A REAL CHALLENGE HERE -- THAT WE CAN'T SORT OF DISCUSSES THE BILL PROGRESSES IF THIS COMMITTEES WILLING TO TO MOVE IT OKAY -- I THINK I THINK -- WHAT ELSE IS LIKE? THREE QUARTERS -- A LOT OF MONEY. IN A BILL THAT THE WE APPROVED A FEW A YEAR OR TWO AGO. SB. ONE SO WE GOT A LOT WE GOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOW FOR TREE QUARTERS -- BUT THE TREE QUARTER PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING DONE OR MAYBE MORE TRUCKING ORIENTED AND THE REAL QUARTERS. THE PUT THE TRADE RAIL QUARTERS OR KIND OF STEP CHILD'S. OKAY THIS IS I'M GIVING YOU A KIND OF A BLUNT TALK HERE. SO SO THIS BILL. FINDS A LITTLE PROJECTS SAVINGS IN THE BONDS THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY GOOD GOOD AMOUNT. AND IT SAYS OKAY WE TAKE THEIR PROJECTS SAVINGS MAY WE CAN USE THAT MONEY. TO UPGRADE THE SHORT. THE SHORTER -- BLIND RAY RHODES THAT EXISTS OR THE SENSUALLY. FALLING APART BECAUSE THEY CAN'T EVEN HOLD THE WEIGHT OF A REGULAR TRAIN. AND WE WANT TO FIX UP THOSE OLD RAIL LINE SO THEY CAN BE USABLE. FROM A TRADE QUARTER STANDPOINT. SO I CAN I I WHEN I LOOKED AT THIS I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S A PRETTY LOGICAL THING IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT I THINK WHAT IT WILL DO IS HELP [inaudible] THESE -- SMALL. SHORT LINE RAILROADS TO BE FIXED UP SO THEY CAN BE USED. FOR OF THE ECONOMY CALIFORNIA BENEFIT. YES THERE'S ALWAYS OTHER PROJECTS THAT WE COULD FIND I THINK WE CAN WORK WITH SAN GABRIEL VALLEY AND WORK OUT. SOME OF THOSE ISSUES WITH THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE FOR TREE QUARTERS IN GENERAL SO. SO THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS -- GOOD BILL IN TERMS OF USE OF THE FUNDS SO I THOUGHT IT WAS A IT GOES TO THEM THE REPAIR. OF RELIANCE THAT ARE NOT IN VERY GOOD CONDITION ESSENTIALLY. WE NEED UPGRADING SO THEY CAN BE USED CORRECTLY. AND I THINK THAT'S A FAIR THING TO DO [inaudible] SO. AND JUST DONE SIR DEFINING THE PUBLIC PURPOSE IN THIS. THIS ACT THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY A PUBLIC POLICY REASON. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE PUBLIC POLICIES. SO OF I DON'T IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT SO WHAT I JUST SAID. BE HAPPY TO LISTEN. TO OKAY CENTER YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS A CLOSE. AT THIS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE OKAY THANK YOU WILL WILL TAKE UP FOR THE VOTE WHEN THE WHEN THE COMMITTEE WHICH IS A QUORUM. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN SECURED THIS YEAR TO BE A CONNECTIVE SEGMENTS OF THE GOOD SUPERVISORS TALK ABOUT FROM HUMBLE COUNTY. I AND WE LOOK FOR TO THE ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL MASTER PLAN -- THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THIS YEAR AND THAT FINAL ON IT WILL BE DELIVERED BY JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE YOU DOWN THE AGENCY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTED THE MOST APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. I THINK THE THE COMPLETION A TRAIL OF THE A THE STATE WHERE JIM. OF SIGNIFICANCE. SO -- IS TOTALLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE HARD WORK YOU PUT IN FOR DECADES IN. THOSE COUNTIES COMPLETED. OF KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND WILL BE SUPPORTING OF OF YOU. IN YOUR EFFORTS AND TAKE THE WORD BACK THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT YOUR COMPLETION OF THAT TRAIL THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US. I WILL DO THAT. HE'S EMISSIONS CHAIR OF WHAT'S THE CEILING TO FIND SOME AUTHORS. THE PRESENT BILL WE HAVE WE'RE DOWN. TO ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN SEVEN AUTHORS. IT'S WATER STONE HERE ITEM OF TWENTY WHICH IS SB SEVEN FORTY TWO AND WELCOME CENTER TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE YOU AT THE FOUR THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT I MISS CHAIR. SO -- THAT SB. SEVEN FORTY TWO REMOVES THE PROHIBITIONS IN CALIFORNIA LAW. THAT CURRENTLY HAMSTRING AND IMPORTANT NETWORK OF PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED INNER CITY BUSES. FROM OPEN THE COMPETING FOR WRITERS WITH PRIVATE. FOR PROFIT BUS OPERATORS YOU WILL SPUR GREATER COMPETITION THE MOCHA OPEN MARKET PLACE. AND HELP GOVERNMENT SPEND TAXPAYER MONEY MORE EFFICIENTLY SO JUST GIVE A LITTLE BACKGROUND CITY CALIFORNIA AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SPEND BILLIONS OF TAX DOLLARS. EVERY YEAR ON TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN ARRAY OF TRANSIT TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. TO INCREASE THE MOBILITY OF A RESIDENCE IN SIR AND VISITORS. BUT SOME OF THAT TAX MONEY IS USED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE REGIONAL JOINT POWER AUTHORITIES TO OPERATE MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE. INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL QUARTERS AT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. A LOT THIS COMMITTEE. AND YOUR COURSE ONLY A CERTAIN PORTION THE STATE IS A COVERED BY RAIL -- AND IN FACT THERE'S A LOT OF MAJOR GAPS IN THE SYSTEM. SO WE NEED TO HAVE CORRIDORS THAT ARE THEN BOLSTERED BY A LARGE NETWORK OF THROUGH A BUSES. THE BRANCH OUT FROM RAIL STATIONS TO CONNECT WRITERS TO OVER TWO FIFTY POUNDS COMMUNITIES. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND EVEN INTO NEVADA AND TO GIVE ME AN IDEA TO GET. FROM LA TO SACRAMENTO THE FASTEST WAY THROUGH RAN TRACK IS TO TAKE A BUS. TO OVER THE OVER THE THE THE THE PAST TO BAKERSFIELD MEN HOP ON THE TRAIN THAT GOES UP -- THE THE CENTRAL VALLEY I'M A SIMILAR YOU KNOW IN IN IN THAT CENTER STONE'S DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A YOU KNOW THE TRAINTHAT GOES EAST ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ARE THEN THE B. BUS CONNECTIONS THAT WILL YOU KNOW WILL TAKE OFF FROM PONDERING STATION FOR EXAMPLE. TO ALLOW FOR A LITTLE MORE ACCESS. AND SO COLLECTIVELY THESE RAILWAYS AND BUSES TOGETHER PROVIDE A RELIABLE AFFORDABLE TRAVEL OPTIONS NOT SIMPLY BETWEEN URBAN HUBS BUT ALSO TO MANY OUT OF THE WAY. MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES HERE'S THE PROBLEM TWENTY YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA NOT TO LEGISLATION. SPONSORED BY A PRIVATE FOR PROFIT BUS COMPANY WHO ARGUED THAT IT NEEDS PROTECTION. AGAINST COMPETITION FROM A NUMBER YOU KNOW FROM FROM -- FROM -- THESE AMTRAK BUSES IN AS A RESULT THERE'S A STATE BAN MODELED AFTER -- THAT BASICALLY PROHIBITS PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED REAL THROUGH A BUSES FROM SELLING TICKETS TO ANY PASSENGER. UNLESS YOU'RE SHE EITHER ROAD ON A TRAIN BEFORE CATCHING THAT BUS OR IS WRITING ON THAT BUS TO CATCH A TRAIN. HOW YOU KNOW HERE'S THE STORY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER WRITTEN ON AN AMTRAK THRUWAY BUS BEFORE BUT SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING OR THE END OF THEIR ROUTE? THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE ON THE BUS. AND YOU KNOW EVEN IF THE BUS STARTS A ROUTE FROM A TRAIN STATION WITH ALL THE SEATS OCCUPIED AS A TRAVELS FROM ONE COMMUNITY TO ANOTHER. IT OFTEN GETS COOKING I AM DEAR AND I'M HERE AND HOUSE A GOOD PUBLIC POLICY TO FOR BID. THAT AMTRAK THRUWAY BUS OR OTHER JOINT POWER AUTHORITIES FROM ADVERTISING IN SELLING TICKETS TO KEEP THOSE SEATS FILLED TO THE BUSES THEMSELVES TO COST. LESS PUBLIC MONEY TO OPERATE IN YOU HAVE LESS PEOPLE ON THE ROADS THE BUSES RUNNING ANYWAY -- HE WE WE MIGHT AS WELL ALLOW THAT BLESSED TO BE ABLE TO SELL TICKETS. HI YOU KNOW SO SO THAT'S MY STRONG FEELING I AND AND YOU KNOW I I REALLY YEAH IF I'VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD THIS UNTIL I FOUND OUT BUT WHY. I'M GETTING THIS HOPEFULLY AND WE'RE GONNA GET THIS ADDRESSED THROUGH THROUGH SB SEVEN FORTY TWO AND I VERY MUCH -- YOU KNOW I I I I I THINK THIS IS A IS A SMART WAY OF ADDRESSING A PROBLEM IN OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN WITH ME TO SUPPORT. THIS BILL -- WE HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES DAN LEVIN WHOSE MANAGER REGIONAL INITIATIVES FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY ALSO DUG. FOR REPRESENTING REAL PACK -- THE REAL PASSENGERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA BATTERY OF SOME OTHER FOLKS TO ORGAN INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. JUNE CHAIR BELL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MONIES CAN LET THAT. ARE PERCENT BOTH THE SAN JOAQUIN JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY AND THE CENTRAL BY WELL WORKING GROUP'S. SO CAN JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IS THE MANAGING AGENCIES FOR THE AMTRAK TELL TEENS INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE. AND SUCH A VIRAL WORKING GROUP IS A TWENTY AGENCY WORKING GROUP THAT INCLUDES ALL THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. REGIONAL REAL OPERATORS COUNTY IS A MAJOR CITIES BETWEEN SACRAMENTO AND MERCED. SB SEVEN FORTY TWO PROPOSES TO AMEND -- IN AND ENABLE STATE FUNDED AMTRAK OPERATED INTERCITY RAIL SERVICES THE SAN JOAQUIN'S KAPPLE CORRIDOR AND THE PACIFIC SURFLINER TO PICK UP AND DROP OFF PASSENGERS ON THEIR AMTRAK INTERCITY THROUGH A BUSES. WITHOUT REQUIRING PASTORS HAVE A REAL TRIP IS PART OF THE TICKET. THIS BILL IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY FOR AT NO ADDITIONAL COST THE RESULT IN REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IMPROVED AIR QUALITY. REDUCE CONGESTION ON THE HIGHWAYS PROVIDE INTERCITY SERVICE TO DISADVANTAGED AND UNDERSERVED RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS INCREASE REVENUE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MOST THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY PRIVATE INNER CITY BUS OPERATORS CALIFORNIA. FOCUS ON ROUTES BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S MAJOR CITIES WITH LIMITED INTERMEDIATE STOPS. FOR THESE MARKETS PRIVATE INTERCITY BUS OPERATORS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ALREADY COMPETING WITH STATE SUPPORTED INTERCITY RAIL AND BUS SERVICES SINCE A TRAIN TRIP IS PART OF THE AMTRAK. TICKET FOR THESE MARKETS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE STATE SUPPORTED AMTRAK THREE BUS ROUTES WILL BE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY SB SEVEN FORTY TWO ARE CONTRACTED OUT TO PRIVATE OPERATORS. AND THAT SB SEVEN FORTY TWO IS CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW SINCE CALIFORNIA INTERCITY RAIL SERVICES IN ASSOCIATE THROUGH A BUSES ARE PREDOMINATELY SUBSIDIZED BY THE STATE. IS GOOD GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY TO BEST UTILIZE STATE INVESTMENT FROM TAXPAYERS DOLLARS AND ON BEHALF OF SOAKING JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY THE CENTER BY REAL WORKING GROUP WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO VOTE YES OTHERS SPEAKERS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BILL MEMBERS AS A TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. HI I AM DOUG KERR OF HEALDSBURG. REPRESENTING REAL PACKED THE REAL PASSENGERS SOCIAIS TION OF CALIFORNIA. THE REAL PACK FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO THANK A CHAIRMAN THEY'LL FOR IS CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR PASSENGER RAIL. REAL PACKS SUPPORTS SB. SEVEN FORTY TWO AMENDING PROVISIONS REQUIRING PURCHASE OF AN AMTRAK BUS TICKET WITH THE TRAIN TICKET. I WILL GIVE TO THE MANY EXAMPLES OF WHY SEVEN FORTY TWO IS NEEDED. THE SAN JOAQUIN CORDER OPERATE SAM TRACKS THROUGH A BUS SERVICE FROM EUREKA ARCADIA TO MARTINEZ. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SERVICE FROM THE NORTH CONNECT WITH THE SMART TRAIN IN SANTA ROSA PROVIDING CAPABILITY. FOR OUR NORTH COAST NEIGHBORS TO REACH ROHNERT PARK CA TIDY PETALUMA AND NEVADO CITIES NOT SERVED BY A PRIVATE BUS OPERATORS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THIS CONNECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THROUGH A BUS TICKET BETWEEN THE NORTH COAST CITIES AND SANTA ROSA IS NOT LINKED TO AN AMTRAK TICKET. AMTRAK TRAIN TICKET. ANOTHER EXAMPLE I LIVE IN HILLS BIRD CINEMA COUNTY. LET'S SAY I WANT TO GO TO FOR TUNA IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. THE AMTRAK THREE BUSES SERVE BOTH CITIES BUT CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS ME FROM USING THEM. PRIVATE BUS OPERATORS ABANDONED SERVICE TO BOTH CITIES YEARS AGO. THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO TRAVEL TO FOR TUNA IS BY AUTOMOBILE. CURRENT LAW PROTECTS PRIVATE OPERATIONS THAT OFTEN DO NOT EXIST. IN FACT ALMOST 60% OF THE STOPS SERVED BY CALIFORNIA THROUGH A BUSES ARE NOT SERVED BY PRIVATE OPERATORS. SB SEVEN FORTY TWO WILL CORRECT THESE ISSUES ALLOW FULL USE OF THE THROUGH A BUS SERVICES. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC TRANSIT CONNECTIONS IN REDUCE AUTOMOBILE USE. REAL PACK URGES PASSAGE OF SB. SEVEN FORTY TWO OTHER WITNESSES -- THIS IS A HERE TO ALREADY SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIDGE BECAUSE KOREAN BEHALF OF THE SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS SANTA BARBARA COUNTY ASSOCIATION A GOVERNMENT'S TRANSPORTATION AGENCY.

DID YOU HAVE PRIVATE OR PUBLIC BUSES GOING TO AND FROM HUMBOLDT COUNTY. WE HAVE PUBLIC BUS SERVICE GOING EAST -- BUT IT TAKES THREE BUSES TO GET TO READING AND THEN IF YOU'RE GOING SOUTH -- WE ALSO HAVE -- WE HAVE GREYHOUND BUS SERVICE -- BUT IT'S ABOUT UP TO OREGON. WE HAVE NOTHING GOING NORTH. OKAY SO YOU HAVE NOTHING GOING TO OREGON NOW NOW -- AND THIS WITH THIS -- FLEXIBILITY IN THE AMTRAK SERVICE WOULD GREATLY HELP -- OUR TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. JERRY MCGUIRE JUST AS THE YOU CAN GET THE DOWN OR DOWNLOAD HAS A SHOULD THE DOWNWARD SINCE THEIR BUS DOWN TO HUMBLE -- I THINK IT'S ONCE A DAY BUT THEN YOU'RE STUCK. IN CRESCENT CITY CAN'T GET UP. TO DEL MAR. IT IS OBVIOUS RESIDENCIA EXACTLY SPECIALLY IF LAST CHANCE GREAT CLOSES DOWN -- WHICH IT HAS -- FOUR TIMES THIS YEAR YEAH GO NORTH OF CRESCENT CITY. HAVE WE ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO KEEP THEIR SALES TAX IN CALIFORNIA. WELL I WAS I WAS SICK AND OF A MAJOR STATE FACILITY UP THERE YEAH YES THAT DAY IT'S A VERY POPULAR -- FACILITY -- AND AS I'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE CHAIR HE'S TOOK ITS WALKING. STREET STORY TOOK HIS WIFE TO PELICAN BAY -- AS PART AS A VACATION TWO YEARS AGO SO -- NO I DID NOT SHE REFUSE -- THAT'S NOT RIGHT EITHER YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT IF I MAY IF I MAY ADD THAT THE CONNECTION TO THE NORTH BAY REALLY IS CULTURALLY CONNECTION FOR US. WHERE IS RIGHT NOW THE AMTRAK US GOES TO MARTINEZ AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO GO TO SAN FRANCISCO YES WE ARE? THANKS OKAY THAT'S THE I THINK. THIS YOU CAN A YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT WOULD APPLY TO A LOT OF READING AND ALL THESE OTHER PLACES -- THE AMTRAK TRAINS GO OKAY -- WILL SPEAK -- AGAINST THE BILL SPEAKERS AGAINST YES MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSH CON AND BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUS ASSOCIATION. THE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IN THE THE FIFTY YEAR. LIGHTNING ROD FOR SAFETY AND PROFESSIONALISM IN THE STATE. FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT. THE ASSOCIATION HAS NO PROBLEM WITH AMTRAK EXPANDING THEIR SERVICE AS WAS JUST SPOKEN ABOUT UP IN THE NORTH COAST. THAT'S PART OF WHAT AMTRAK SHOULD DO AND WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF CONNECTING TO RAIL SERVICE. HI THE BILL THOUGH IN BRIEF -- DOES BASICALLY SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT SUPPORT AND THAT IS IT SETS A SYSTEM UP -- PROVIDING TAXPAYER FUNDS TO COMPETE AGAINST TAX PAYNE BUS COMPANIES. HI. TWO THINGS ARE HAPPENING HERE ONE IS THAT THE FEEDER BUS SYSTEM FOR AMTRAK AND TO IS THE BILL AS ALLOWING DISTRICTS TO ENTER THIS MARKET PLACE. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS PRETTY SIMPLE ALL GIVE YOU JUST THREE REASONS SENATOR AND MEMBERS -- ONE IS -- THOSE TRANSIT DISTRICTS ARE TAX EXEMPT SO THAT MEANS THAT PRIVATE COMPANIES NOT IN THIS. AREA. HAVE TO PAY ALL THE FEDERAL STATE AND ESTATE SALES TAX INCLUDING I PERSONALLY SUPPORT ADDRESS BE ONE MANY BUS COMPANIES SUPPORT SB. ONE NOW THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE USED AGAINST PRIVATE COMPANIES A AND E'S SUBSIDIZED WAY. HI THE FEDERAL TAX EXEMPTION IS SEVEN CENTS THE STATE -- TAX EXEMPTION IS THIRTY SIX CENTS THE ESTATE SALES TAX EXEMPTION IS THIRTY ONE CENTS. NUMBER TWO POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE A SENATOR -- AND MEMBERS -- THE UNITED STATES CALIFORNIA AND LOCAL MONIES SUBSIDIZE -- TRANSIT OPERATIONS WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT 7280% OF THE OVERALL OPERATION COSTS OF THOSE TRANSIT DISTRICTS -- ARE ARE SUBSIDIZED BY OUR TAX DOLLARS. WITHIN THE SUBSIDY A SUBSIDY SIR TAXPAYER FUNDS FOR CLEAN VEHICLES AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CARP TO CLEAN OUR FLEETS EACH ONE OF OUR OUR COACHES COST ABOUT A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS NOW. HI SO AND WE'VE HAD TO UPGRADE OUR FLEETS TO COMPORT OURSELVES WITH THE THE AIR STANDARDS THAT ARE THAT WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH FOR FEDERAL LAW PURPOSES IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT. THE THIRD PIECE IS RIGHT NOW MEMBERS THERE IS A VIBRANT PRIVATE INDUSTRY IN THIS SECTOR. THE VIBRANT PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS UPWARDS OF TWENTY DIFFERENT COMPANIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT OPERATE PRIVATELY WITHOUT SUBSIDY WITHOUT THE SUBSIDIES THAT I'VE NAMES. AND WITHOUT THE SUBSIDIES THAT ACTUALLY HI. BASICALLY FREE EQUIPMENT AND AND CAPITAL COSTS TO OPERATE. SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU -- BUT WE ARE. IN OPPOSITION WOULD URGE YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS MEASURE -- OKAY LET'S HEAR IF THERE'S OTHER OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ANYBODY ELSE ARE. I SER HAD A QUESTION -- THE PRIVATE OPERATORS SAW. WORK WITH THE PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES HAVE WORKED WITH THE PUBLIC AT TRANSIT AGENCIES YES AT A COOPERATIVE MANNER YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY IN CALIFORNIA SIR IN CERTAIN SENT AND CERTAIN AREAS YES PRIVATE OPERATORS TO AND IN FACT PRIVATE OPERATORS IN THE AMTRAK SYSTEM YES. THOSE ARE MEMBERS OF OURS ROD BUT THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM IN THOSE TAXES WHEN HEY WERE -- THE PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE BILLED SO. BUS TERMINALS CONSTRUCTED THOSE BUS TERMINALS ENCOURAGE. INTER CONNECTIONS WITH THE BUS TERMINALS FROM THE TRANSIT SYSTEMS. OF SO THAT. THAT. IS THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP THAT'S A POSITIVE THING FOR PRIVATE OPERATORS CORRECT. SO THAT'S THAT SO. YOU KNOW WHEN WE YOU KNOW LIKE WE'RE BUILDING BUS TERMINALS IN SAN JOSE OR LIKE HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE ONE RIGHT -- WHILE THE MEGA BUS OPERATES OUT OF THE SIXTY FIFTH STREET JOSH AND YEAH THE BUS THAT GOES FROM RENO TO SACRAMENTO SACRAMENTO TO SAN FRANCISCO YEAH YEAH SO IT IT IT KIND OF THERE IS -- SO THE QUESTION. FOR MAYBE -- SIR ALAN. IS WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE. PUBLIC. SYSTEMS BUT ALSO PRIVATE SYSTEM HOW. TO HELLO HOW HOW DID YOU -- HOW DO YOU FEEL YOUR BILL ANSWERS THAT QUESTION? YEAH SO THIS. PORTANTINO SO RECENTLY THIS BILL JUST RELATES. TO THE THE BUSES THAT DATE THE X. CONNECT TO AND SERVE THE RAIL SYSTEM. SO I IT DOESN'T SUPPLANT THE RAIL SYSTEM SO ANYTHING THAT SO SO THE THE THE BIG ROUTES BETWEEN SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE. THAT THE PRIVATE BUSES ARE INVOLVING THE PRIVATE BUSES ARE INVOLVED IN IN SERVING THAT THE BIG CITY DID BIG CITY ROUTES. AND AT MOST OF THOSE ARE SERVED BY RAIL ALREADY -- WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS IS -- TO PROVIDE FOR A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO THOSEBUSES THAT CONNECT UP TO THE EXISTING RAIL SYSTEM -- AND IN A LOT OF RURAL AREAS FOR EXAMPLE AS WE HEARD FROM OUR FRIEND FROM THE NORTH COAST -- THAT IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE ONLY YOU KNOW. MAJOR TYPES OF OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AVAILABLE ARE YOU THAT THE THE PRIVATE FOLKS SERVED ARE PROVIDING AN IMP INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SERVICE BUT THEY ONLY PROVIDE SERVICE. TO THOSE ARE RUDE SAID OUR MOST PROFITABLE FOR FOR GOOD REASON. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I FOR GONNA BE RUNNING BUSES WHICH WE DO BECAUSE WE WANT TO SERVE ALL PARTS OF THE STATE -- UP AND DOWN AREAS WHERE THERE MAY NOT BE THE SAME KIND OF TRAFFIC -- YOU KNOW ON THE NORTH COAST IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ACTUALLY FILLING OUT THOSE BUSES. AT B. THE BUSES ARE RUNNING ANYWAY WE MIGHT AS WELL GET THEM FILLED AND SO THAT THAT'S ALL WE'RE DOING HERE WE'RE NOT SUPPLANTING THE THE THE MAJOR IN A RAIL -- INTERCITY RAIL SYSTEM -- YOU KNOW THE MEGA BUS WILL CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITH THE RAIL SERVICE. AND WILL DO SO VERY COMPETITIVELY EFFECTIVELY -- SUB. THAT'S ALL THAT THE BILL SEEKS TO DO IT'S NOT ACT A KIND OF MASSIVE CHALLENGE TO PRIVATE BUSES IN UFC RIGHT WE DO OE OUT PEOPLE ON ON ALL FORMS OF PUBLIC REGISTRY CLEANING YEAH. PRIVATELY RUN PUBLIC EDUCATION -- WHEN WE DID SB [inaudible] ONE WE CORRECT YOU'RE CORRECT WE WHAT WE DID IS WE SET UP A FUND FOR THE FIRST TIME. FOR INTER CITY RAIL IT -- COMMUTER REAL. FUNDED BY THE STATE TRANSIT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SO WE SET UP A FUNDING MECHANISM SP ONE FROM THE STATE AND TRANSIT TO FIND THE THE TREND THE REAL TRANSIT -- AUTHORITIES LIKE YOUR ONE IN SAN JOAQUIN -- THE SMART -- THE OTHER ONES. CALTRAIN -- YOU KNOW THOSE SERVICE. AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUSES. AND THE QUESTION THE QUESTION WOULD BE -- I THINK YOU MAY BE DONE MAYBE. SERVICE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON THIS BUT I THINK WE NEED TO INCLUDE. SB INCLUSIVE NOT EXCLUSIVE SO WE STATE WE NEED TO INCLUDE. THE BUSES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT ALSO WE SHOULD WORK WITH THE PRIVATE BUSES. TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO BETTER FACILITATE -- THE BUS SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA -- TO ENCOURAGE BUSES BECAUSE BUSES. HELP REDUCE POLLUTION. THEY HELP THOUGH THAT'S PART OF OUR GOAL. AND MORE PEOPLE RIDING THE BUSES IS GOOD THANK MY OPINION. SO -- IN TERMS OF THE PLANNING THAT THAT WE DO -- FOR INNER CITY [inaudible] CALIFORNIA PLANNINGWE NEED TO INCLUDE SOME KIND OF WAY OF HAVING BUSES INCLUDE IN THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN OF THE STATE. I MISSED NO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK ON OKAY ALL AGES FOR WE HOPE YOU AGREE WITH THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND NOT IN THE PLAN RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WE HAVE A STATE RAIL PLAN WE HAVE A RIGHT. THE MASTER PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION. SHOULD INCLUDE BUSES THESE INTERCONNECTIONS THESE BUS BRIDGES. EURO SERVING ALL THE COMMUNITIES. THE DON'T HOUSE PUBLIC SERVICE INNER CITY SERVICE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. SO I I THINK THAT SOME NOT BE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. I MEAN SURROUND BROKE BROACH THE SUBJECT I THINK WE CAN WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS HERE. AND WORK ON THAT TO CONTINUE PRESS ONE OF THINGS ALL SAY THIS. IS I KNOW THAT THE RAIL SYSTEM BENEFITS FROM THE PRIVATE BUSES. BECAUSE THEY DROPPED PASSENGERS OFFICE DOES RAIL STATIONS AND PEOPLE GET OFF THOSE. PRIVATE BUSES AND THEY GET ON THE REAL LINES YES AND SO THAT THAT'S A BENEFIT TO THE A RAIL SYSTEM AS WELL. WORKING TOGETHER BOTH BENEFIT FROM EACH OTHER. SO THE INTER CONNECTED WITH THE BENEFITS WE WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU AND SENATOR ALLEN ON THAT MR CHAIRMAN I THINK. MISSION OF CLARIFICATION THOUGH IT SEEMS LIKE CENTER ALLEN IS ST. THAT HI HE HE HE ISN'T TRYING TO GET DISTRICTS INVOLVED IN THE PRIVATE WORK. THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN. IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S HAPPENING. AND SO IF CENTER ALLEN WOULD WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON THAT AS WELL AS YOUR RECOMMENDATION MISTER CHAIRMAN WE WOULD THAT WE WOULD WELCOME THAT THANK YOU. BECAUSE WE WE DO. WE CAN'T OUR OUR CLIENTS OUR MEMBER COMPANIES CAN'T COMPETE AGAINST 80% -- SUBSIDIES NO TAXES ON FUEL WE THEY JUST CAN'T DO IT RIGHT NO DIFFERENT THAN I REALLY CAN'T COMPETE AGAINST IN THIS FORM AGAIN CENTER ALLEN AND HIS LEGISLATION. ALL GRANT HIM THAT. BECAUSE HE'S A WERE THE FOR THE MEMBER AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AND SENATOR ALAN. THANK YOU OF SOME REQUIRE. THANK YOU VERY QUICKLY TO CHAIR AT JUST WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD LOOK BOTTOM LINE IS COMMONSENSE APPROACH -- IN ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA GIVEN EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE HAVING TO BE ABLE TO GO TO SAN FRANCISCO TO ARCADIA. YOU TRAVEL FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SANTA ROSA YOU PUT IT VERY WELL COULD POTENTIALLY SWITCH OR GAIN PASSENGERS AND YOU GO TO SANTA ROSA TO UKIAH. WHEN YOU GO TO YOUKAI AT TO ARCADIA IN WHAT SHOULD BE A FOUR HOUR ISRAELI DOUBLE THE TIME TO BE ABLE TO GET? UP THE NORTH COAST. IN WHAT WE KNOW IS RIGHT NOW THERE ARE VERY FEW SEATS IN MANY ON OF THESE ROUTES THAT ARE TAKEN. AND IF THERE IS AN ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY INTO THE SYSTEM. IT JUST MAKES SENSE I APPRECIATE. THE GOOD CENTER FOR BRING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S THAT I THINK COMPETITION IS GOOD YOU'RE ABLE TO FILL IN THE SEATS -- AND IT'S GONNA BE MORE CONVENIENT ESPECIALLY. FOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN SOME OF THE MOST RURAL AREAS IN HER CHALLENGED -- TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK HOME AND ALSO HELPS THOSE WHO ARE. ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND DAD WHO REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE. TO TRAVEL IN A WAY THAT IS ECONOMIC FOR THEIR FAMILY SO DO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK. OKAY THANK YOU ARE CENTER YOU HAVE A CLOSE STATEMENT YEAH I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF EVERYBODY AND AND AND I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BY BY OUR FRIENDS FROM THE PRIVATE BUS. INDUSTRY THE WHAT THE WHY ONE I GUESS MY ONE PUSH BACK IS. WHEN AND AND THE CHAIR KNOWS A LOT MORE ABOUT SB ONE THAN I DO BUT -- BUT ARE FINDING WENT INTO -- INTO THE INTO GROWING THE RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE YEAH AND THE TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE NOT -- YES SUBSIDIZING -- THROUGH A BUSES THE SP ONE FINDS. I AM SO. SO I I A A ALABAMA A ONE PUSH BACK ON THAT BUT I THINK THE GENERAL BAR TEN HERE IS TO JUST. YOU KNOW ADDRESS THE THE IN A GROTESQUE -- SITUATION WHERE WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW TREAT YOUR BUSES THAT ARE YOU KNOW CONNECTING PEOPLE TO OUR IMPORTANT RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE WE WANT PEOPLE TO CLEAN RURAL AREAS THAT ARE FAR FROM -- TRAIN STATIONS AND OTHER FORMS TRANSPORTATION TO ACCESS THE AMTRAK NETWORK AND YET IT'S JUST CRAZY THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW THESE BUSES THAT ARE RUNNING WITH ONE PERSON ON THE IS ON THE BUS FOR HOURS AND HOURS JUST BECAUSE BECAUSE WE WANT YOU KNOW AND THEN AND AND THEN. THERE THE BUSES ARE STOPPING IN IN IN IN GOING ALSO DIFFERENT CITIES AND IF WE CAN SELL TICKETS BETWEEN THOSE CITIES WE REALLY OUGHT TO AND SO. I I I ABSOLUTELY WITH THE CHAIR WHEN WE SEE THAT THE PRIVATE BUS SYSTEM IS IN AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR BROADER TRANSPORTATION NETWORK AND HAPPY. TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND TALK SHOP ABOUT HOW WE CAN -- WE CAN WE CAN MEET OUR MUTUAL GOALS WITH THIS BILL AND SO -- THEM VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION EDU THANKS FOR A VOTE -- OKAY CENTER -- WE WILL CALL THE ROLL ON THIS BOAT. WHEN WE REACH MORE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU? THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU BETTER HERTZBERG IS -- MOMENTARILY EXPECTED SO. ON HIS BILL. YOUR OVER. CENTER -- CHURCH BIRD WILL BE.

THREE SIXTY NINE AND WILL TURN OVER CENTER HERTZBERG. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR CENTER. OKAY THANKS BOB JAMES. TOMORROW OKAY SO YOU TO MARK YEAH [inaudible] SHERMAN. HOW YOU DOING TODAY? LONG DAY SOME ACCOUNTS DID YOU SAY THE LAST COMMITTEE I'M MORE THAN ONE OF THE SENATOR -- I GOT TWO HOURS BEFORE GAME TIME. OKAY THE SEVENTH GAME OF FIRST LET ME BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE ARGUMENT LAYOFFS I LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW HOW. I KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT SPORTS I KNOW PLAYOFFS OF WHAT SPORT H. DIET. SO WHAT CAN I SAY WELL THE SHARKS OR PLANE TODAY FOR THE SEVEN GAMES. WERE. HOLDING OFF FOR A VICTORY. SO EACH OF US IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] ON HAVE STORIES ABOUT ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS. JUST ITS PURPOSE IT IS JUST BEEN NOTHING LESS THAN EXTRAORDINARY. AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE THAT I'VE BEEN QUITE FRUSTRATED WITH MISTER CHAIRMAN. IS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WERE IN THE ACT CAN BE OTHER COMMITTEE THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE. IS THAT WERE OUT THERE SPEND ALL THIS MONEY PASSING ALL THESE MEASURES IN LOS ANGELES CITY AND COUNTY PASSING MEASURES OF THE STATE. PASSING MEASURES FOR HOUSING IN TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP THE HOMELESS. AND THE REALITY IS IS THAT THOSE WHO FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS EXCUSE ME. WITH THE REALITY IS IS IS THAT WHAT'S THE IMPACT IS IT WE SEE IT ON THE STREET EVERY SINGLE DAY AND SO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE SOME NEAR TERM ISSUES THAT WE CAN DO THAT CAN IMPACT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE. THAT FOLKS WHO FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS CAN CAN ENGAGE IN WE HAVE A BILL WHICH SOME OF YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE IS SEEN DEALING WITH PETS 425% OF THE PEOPLE AND TOLD IN LOS ANGELES. HAVE PETS AND WILL GOING. TO YOU GUYS. GOING TO A HOMELESS SHELTER BECAUSE ARE THEY CAN'T TAKE THEIR PETS ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS IN CARS. THE THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN LIVE AND THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE AND SO WORKING WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TIONAL HERE FROM -- HERE TODAY BUT TOGETHER WITH -- OTHER WESTERN CENTER WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH TO GATHER WITH THIS COMMITTEE HOW CAN WE ADD TO PUBLIC POLICY THEY CAN CREATE. QUICK A QUICKER RESPONSE IS FOR FOLKS THAT ARE IN CARS PROVIDING SAFE PARKING AND SO. THE THE THE BASICALLY WHAT THIS MEASURE DOES IS THAT THIS SB THREE SIXTY NINE ENCOURAGES THAT THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY. WHICH CURRENTLY OPERATING AS A PARKING PROGRAM THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES WERE INDIVIDUALS OR LIVING OUT OF THEIR CARS TO GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. AND SO WHILE AT THE THE THE THE FOLKS WHO ARE HERE TODAY TO HELP US A TALK TALK ABOUT THAT -- AT THE AT THE WESTERN CENTER -- WE HAVE YOU MIKE HERALD WAS ALWAYS HERE BUT HE HAS -- IT MORE WEEKS WHEN THE PRESSURE CORRECTLY WHO'S BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON THE DETAILS OF THIS AND I WANTED HIM TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN SPEAKER. AS WELL AS ANDREW ENTRY THE THOUGHTFUL -- FORMER -- COULD CHIEF CONSULTANT OF THE CAN THIS COMMITTEE IN THE OTHER HOUSE SOME YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF THE GREAT TALENTS IN THIS BUILDING THE SOLID DOWNTREND TRADE. TO ALSO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU WANT ONE WE HAVE START WITH A STRANGELY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS INJURY ANTS WE WOULD SHOW YOUR ANSWER HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI -- THE CITY PARKING PROGRAMS ARE CROPPING UP -- BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME NEED THESE ARE SERVICES THAT ARE RENDERED ON PARKING LOTS AFTER HOURS TYPICALLY WHERE PEOPLE ARE GIVEN A SAFE PLACE TO PARK THESE ARE SICK PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE. THEIR CARS ARE LAST WORLDLY POSITION IN THIS AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY SERVING AS THE PLACE WHERE THEY SLEEP. AND WE GIVE THEM A PLACE WHERE THEY'RE NOT ADDRESS FOR THE VEHICLES BEING TOLD. AND THEY'RE ALSO RECEIVING SERVICES A SIMILAR TO NAVIGATION CENTERS WHERE THEY'RE ASSESSED. COM AT THE LEVEL WHERE THEY ARE AND THE DETERMINATION HAS BEEN MADE TO THEY NEED SMOG ASSISTANCE OF ANY RELIEF WITH BACK PARKING FINES. THEY NEED TO BE REFERRED TO A MORE PERMANENT HOUSING SITUATION MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THERE'S ALSO OPPORTUNITIES FOR PLACEMENT OF MOBILE SHOWERS -- AND THERE'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO KIND OF DEAL WITH THEIR PERSONAL BELONGINGS IN A PLACE THAT'S LOCKED AND SAFE OVERNIGHT -- BUT WE FOR THE FINAL SOCIAL SITUATION WHERE BECAUSE THE VEHICLE -- HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE UP TO DATE ON THEIR SMALL. AND THE TAGS ARE BAD DURING THE DAY WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN THESE PARKING LOTS TO GET HAVE THOSE VEHICLES TOLD ARE TAKEN AWAY. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE THANK CENTER HERTZBERG FOR BRING IS MEASURE FORWARD BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW US TO ENHANCE THE ASSISTANCE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING. FOLKS THE FINAL CELLS IN THE SITUATION. FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS SPEAKERS. THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU THE CHAIR FOR GIVING ME TIME TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE -- WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCE A CRISIS IN HOMELESSNESS ON LOS ANGELES ALONE FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND NEARLY A THIRD OF THEM ARE LIVING THEIR VEHICLES ARE HALF OF WHICH ARE CHILDREN -- BUT WHEN INDIVIDUALS SEEK SHELTER IN THEIR VEHICLES THEY ALSO PUT THOSE VEHICLES AT RISK BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA -- LOCALITIES CAN TOLL AN IMPOUND YOUR VEHICLE IF IT'S REGISTRATION HAS BEEN LAPSED FOR OVER SIX MONTHS -- OUR CLIENTS MANY TIMES CANNOT BRING THE FUNDS TOGETHER TO PAY THE HIGH VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES OUT ONCE -- AND THEN MANY OF THEM ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN THEIR VEHICLES BECAUSE THEY CAN FIND PROPER HOUSING SO AS A LIVE IN THEIR VEHICLES ON THE STREETS -- THEY RISK LOSING THEM -- NOW -- SB THREE SIX NINE SIX TO REMEDY THIS -- IT ACTS AS A BRIDGE OF SORTS IT'S NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION BUT IS IMPORTANT -- BECAUSE IT PROVIDES OR CREATES A FRAMEWORK IN OUR STATE -- TO CREATE THE SAY PARKING PROGRAM SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN COME AT NIGHT THEY CAN PARK THEIR CARS -- THEY CAN BE GUARDED -- THEY CAN HAVE ACCESS TO FACILITIES AND RESOURCES -- ABOUT ARE IMPORTANT FOR THEM -- AND WHILE ALL AT THE SAME TIME UTILIZING UNDER USE PARKING SPACES ARE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE WIDER COMMUNITY -- SO. SAY PARKING PROGRAMS LIKE THIS HAVE ALREADY HAD SUCCESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM LOS ANGELES SORRY TALK ABOUT THEIR PROGRAM -- SANTA BARBARA AS WELL HAVE WON THE EARLY IS PROGRAM TO STAR IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THEY'VE SERVE THOUSANDS OF PARTICIPANTS -- AND IT'S BEEN HIGHLIGHTED BY THE COMMUNITY AND BEEN GENERALLY REGARDED AS A SUCCESS SO -- WHILE THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T SAY THAT IT IS -- IT DOESN'T A RECOGNIZES THAT. OUR PROBLEM WITH HOMELESSNESS WILL NOT BE SOLVED TOMORROW -- WE MUST STILL DO ALL THAT WE CAN'T TODAY TO HELP OUR NEIGHBORS -- AND THAT'S WHY THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY URGES AN AYE VOTE I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. AND TESTING -- SPEAK OTHERS SPEAKERS IN FAVOR PLEASE. SPEAKERS IN FAVOR. OF SPEAKERS OPPOSING. AND IF UP OPPOSITION.

DURING THE NIGHT TIME HOURS. THANK YOU FOR THAT WILL JUST -- TO ADD TO THAT THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT STEPS VALLEY'S. TRYING TO PROVIDE A SAFE PLACE FOR OUR HOMELESS POPULATION AND BUT THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL THANK YOUNG. THANK YOU SIR. WAY TO A RECORD. SENATOR AND A QUESTION OF A GROUP CALLED THE STUDENT HOMELESS ALLIANCE. STUDENT HOMELESS ALLIANCE. CAME TO ME IN SAN JOSE THEY'RE YOUNG. YOUNG PEOPLE THAT GO TO SAN JOSE STATE [inaudible] AND THE ASKED ME ABOUT THIS KIND OF PROGRAM -- AND THEN I HAD ANOTHER GROUP COME TO ME. FROM SALAS. CITY COLLEGE. THEY TOLD ME THERE'S LIKE FOUR FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS LIVING IN CARS AROUND SO AS THE CITY COLLEGE [inaudible] OKAY. AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THERE'S BEEN A RECENT SURVEY ABOUT.

WHO ARE DOING THIS STUFF AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE THEY'RE GOING TO CHURCHES AND TEMPLES AND SCHOOLS AND TRYING TO FIND FOLKS THAT WILL LET THEM USE THEIR PARKING LOTS SO THE IDEA? WAS HOW CAN WE KIND OF HELP OVERCOME SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND CERTAINLY. HE WITH YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL IS TO DO GO AS FAR DOWN THAT LINE AS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN -- BUT CLEARLY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GO ON OF MANAGED MISTER ENTRY FEE OF ANY THOUGHTS TO ADD TO THAT. IS THIS WITH TALKED ABOUT IN LOS ANGELES AND YOUR IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED -- THERE'S ACTUALLY A BILL ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE BY SELLING MEMBER BERMAN THAT LOOKS AT THIS KIND OF APPLICATION ON PARKING FACILITIES ON COMMITTEE COLLEGE SETTINGS. SENATOR -- THERE'S NOTHING TO PRECLUDE -- A PROPERTY OWNER BE AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR SCHOOL UNIVERSITY FROM WORKING WITH THE NONPROFIT TO SET THIS PROGRAM -- WHAT WE'RE THANKFUL ABOUT IN THIS BILL IS THAT IT SETS THE PARAMETERS SO THAT? THESE WILL BE CERTIFIED PROGRAMS SO THAT THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO MAKE THEMSELVES ELIGIBLE FOR THE SMOG CHECK REPAIR SYSTEM. THAT THEY ARE RECOGNIZED PROGRAM. AND THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF THRESHOLD FOR ENTRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PIPELINE OF PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD FOR THIS TYPE OF ASSISTANCE -- THERE'S A BONA FIDE PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

THIS IS SB SIX SIX TWO BY CENTER ARE CHIRLA -- CENTER YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU CENTER I APPRECIATE THE TIME COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN TODAY I COME BEFORE YOU WITH THE SENATE BILL SIX SIX TWO WHICH WOULD ALLOW INVESTOR OWNED. ELECTRICAL UTILITIES TO MEET THEIR TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION MANDATE. WHICH BY INVESTING IN RENEWABLE HYDROGEN AS A TRANSPORTATION FUEL. IN ADDITION TO THEIR CURRENT SINGULAR COMPLIANCE PATHWAY OF INVESTMENTS IN BATTERY ELECTRIC CHARGING PROJECTS. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. AND TO AFFIRM TO YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY IMPOSED MANDATE THAT THE UTILITIES DO THEIR SHARED CLEAN UP OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AN OVERDUE AND MUCH NEEDED STEP TO CLEAN UP OUR AIR IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS MEANT TO COME TO COMPLEMENT THE GROUND BREAKING STRIDES MADE UNDER SB THREE FIFTY BY BRINGING ANOTHER TECHNOLOGY INTO THE FRAY AND ADDING AN ADDITIONAL WEAPON. TO OUR ARSENAL IN THE FIGHT TO REDUCE TRANSPORTATION RELATED EMISSIONS AND CALIFORNIA. SB SIX SIX TWO DOES NOT IMPOSE ADDITIONAL MANDATE ON UTILITIES BUT RATHER ADDS AN ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE PATHWAY FOR THEIR EXISTING MANDATES. THIS BILL WILL HOWEVER FACILITATE A TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL STANCE ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION AND ALLOW FOR RENEWABLE HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY TO PLAY A ROLE IN HELPING US ACHIEVE. OUR EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS IN CALIFORNIA. HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN WIDELY ACCEPTED AS A ARE A CRUCIAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE TO TRANSFORM OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. PARTICULARLY IN THE HEAVY DUTY SPACE AND IT IS. IT IS PAST TIME THAT THE STATE INVEST IN BEHAVIOR. THE DISPLAY A RECOGNITION OF THIS FACT AS WELL. I'VE BEEN IN THESE TECHNICALITY I'VE SEEN THIS AT THE TECHNOLOGIES IN ACTION I'VE DRIVEN THE HYDRO FUEL CELL VEHICLE. AND THE PERFORMANCE WAS IS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN MY OWN CONVENTIONAL CAR. I ACTUALLY FEEL THE THE AUTOMOBILE THAT I WAS DRIVING -- WITH THE HYDROGEN AND THAT THE SPEED IT TOOK TO FILL BAD WAS EQUIVALENT TO MY CAR. AND I PUT THE HELLO BACK ON THE ON THE PUMP DROVE OFF AND I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE BRIDGE SPOT. I JUST RECENTLY RETURNED FROM JAPAN. FOR THE FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY IS WIDELY ACCEPTED NOT AND ADOPTED HYDROGEN WORKS AND IT'S OUR PLANS IN THE FUTURE AND IF WE CAN START WORKING WITH IT TODAY. LIKE MOST BUILT AT THIS POINT TIME IT IS NOT YET -- PERFECT BUT I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS TO CRAFT A BILL THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS AND ADDING HYDROGEN. INTO OUR TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION EFFORTS. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE JAKE -- DONAHUE AND TIM SAN SCENE WITH -- BILLARD FUEL IN THE FUEL SYSTEM AND THEY ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. AND MISTER GERALD TURN IT OVER TO THEM IF YOU DON'T MIND. THANK YOU CENTER -- WITNESSES IN FAVOR PLEASE. MR SURE MEMBERS J. DONOHUE ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR BALLARD FUEL CELL SYSTEMS AS WELL AS SOME LINE TRANSIT AGENCY RED OR WHITE FLEET AND GOLDEN GATE ZERO MISSION MARINE. THESE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENT A BROAD SWATH OF THE HYGIENE INDUSTRY FROM ALL THE ENGINEERING MANUFACTURING AND END USER PERSPECTIVES. THESE DIVERSE VIEWPOINTS PUT TOGETHER A COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED FOR HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY IN TRANSFORMING OUR HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TWO ZERO MISSION. KERN INVESTMENTS IN BATTERY ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY HAVE BY MAGNITUDE OF MORE THAN TEN FAR EXCEEDED THOSE AND HYDROGEN. THE ISSUE WITH THIS IS THAT WHILE THOSE INVESTMENTS IN BATTERY ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY HAVE CLEAR VALUE IN ACHIEVING THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS THEY WILL NOT GET IS THERE ALONE. THIS BILL SEEKS TO SIMPLY ALLOW CALIFORNIA ELECTRICAL UTILITIES TO MAKE DYNAMIC INVESTMENTS IN MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGIES AS A PART OF THEIR PURSUIT OF TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. RATHER THAN THEIR CURRENT MANDATE TO PUT ALL THEIR EGGS IN ONE BASKET. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US IN THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO CRAFT A MAN IS THAT WE FEEL MAKE THE BILL EVEN BETTER AND WHAT THAT I HEARD YOUR AYE VOTE ON THE BILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU [inaudible] OTHER WITNESSES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M TIM TESTING WITH BALLARD FUEL CELL SYSTEMS THE SPONSORS SENATE BILL. SIX SIX TWO WE SPONSORED THIS BILL TO PROVIDE A MECHANISM TO MORE EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVE CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS AND CRITERIA POLLUTANT REDUCTION GOALS. HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY IS PROVEN TO BE THE ONLY FEASIBLE ZERO EMISSIONS OPTIONS FOR MANY OPERATORS IN THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY. ARENAS SUCH AS BUSES TRUCKS MARINE VESSELS AND LOCOMOTIVES. THE LONG ROUTES AND OPERATING TIMES EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND HIGH ENERGY DEMANDS. ARE JUST A FEW REASONS WHY FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN NEEDED IN THESE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY APPLICATIONS. WITHOUT INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLE HYDROGEN THOSE APPLICATIONS WHERE NEEDS CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY MET BY BATTERY ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY. WILL LIKELY BE APPLICATIONS THAT REMAIN POWERED BY DIESEL AND OTHER NON ZERO EMISSION PAT POWERTRAINS A PATHWAY WHICH IS IN STARK CONTRAST THIS LEGISLATURE STATED GOALS FOR THE FUTURE. SB SIX SIXTY WILL BRING SOME SEMBLANCE OF PARITY IS STATE AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS IN ZERO MISSION TECHNOLOGIES AND FOR THAT REASON WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES. GOT TO STEVE ALL COMBAT THE CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION ENVIRONMENT ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ROCKY RAGING WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEED TO GO FOR THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WE ACTUALLY DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE SPOT THIS TIME BUT WE'RE HOPING TO SUPPORT THE BILL IN THE NEAR FUTURE -- THE ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ON IS. WHETHER OR THIS BILL PICKS WINNERS OR LOSERS AND SOME OF BY MEMBERS ACTUALLY PRODUCE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN ON IT'S VERY COST EFFECTIVE IT IS FULLY RENEWABLE -- IT HAD IT CAN HAVE A LOWER CARBON INTENSITY AND EVEN A CARBON NEGATIVE -- INTENSITY BUT UNFORTUNATELY DOES NOT FIT THE DEFINITION -- IN THIS BILL AND SO WE'RE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM HAVING VERY POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS AND JUST WANTED TO STATE OUR ISSUE FOR THE RECORD THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY -- OTHER SUPPORTERS OF OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE ANYBODY ONE IS BIG. OPPOSING THE BILL. QUESTIONS WERE COMMITTEE. OF SIR WHAT CAO SKI ANYBODY ELSE. YOU HAD IN YOUR COMMITTEE YEAH.

IS DESIGNED TO HAVE CALIFORNIANS TURN IN THEIR HIGH POLLUTING CLUNKER CARS. FOR OTHER VEHICLES WITH THIS BILL DOES IS IT SIMPLY ALLOWS. CALIFORNIANS THE TURN IN THEIR HIGH POLLUTING CLUNKER CARS FOR AN E. BIKE WHICH IS FAR MORE EFFICIENT TERMS OF BOTH ENERGY AS WELL AS POLLUTION. THEN -- ANOTHER VEHICLE FOR A VOUCHER FOR EXAMPLE FOR OTHER MOBILITY OPTIONS IT'S A SIMPLE BILL AND HIGHER JUGGLED WITH ME TODAY IS LARA PT ALL SKI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF UC INSTEAD OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES. AND LINDA -- COMMOTION SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION. NOT PROFESSOR BUT I APPRECIATE THAT -- CHAIR BILL IN MEMBERS HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY LOWER PUT ALL SKI WITH YOU SEE INSTEAD OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL JUST HERE TO PROVIDE EXPERT TESTIMONY -- I'M SPEAKING TO A NEW BRIEF THAT JUST CAME OUT THIS MONTH FROM DOCTOR DILLON FINCH WHO IS THE CO DIRECTOR. OF THE BICYCLING PLUS RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE GROUP AT UC DAVIS SO HE LOOKED AT AND SUMMARIZED THE EXISTING STUDIES LOOKING AT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN E. BICYCLING AND REDUCTION AND CAR TRIPS. AND VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND HE FOUND THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT THAT YOU BICYCLING DOES REDUCE CAR TRIPS AND DOES REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. I'M THEIR MANY STUDIES IN EUROPE ON THIS THERE ARE THE E. BIKE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ARE PREVALENT IN THE IN EUROPE. AT THE NATIONAL. REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL THEY'RE VERY RARE IN THE U. S. THOUGH I'M SO IN LOOKING AT STUDIES IN EUROPE HE FOUND THAT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY OF 35250% OF P. BY TRICK IT EASY BIKE TRIPS. WOULD HAVE MADE BY CAR IF THE BIKE WAS NOT MADE AVAILABLE. AND THERE WAS A SMALLER GROUP OF STUDIES IN NORTH AMERICA THAT FOUND 112406% OF E. BIKE TRIPS SUBSTITUTED FOR CAR TRIPS LOSES JUST TO GO TO SHOW THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE E. BIKES DO. OF SUBSTITUTE FOR CAR TRIPS AND VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED -- IN SUMMARY OF CALIFORNIA DECIDES TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR E. BIKES WHICH THERE IS EVIDENCE AGAIN TO SHOW THAT HE BIKES DO SUBSTITUTE FOR CAR TRIPS AND VMT. THEN THE U. S. UCITS WOULD RECOMMEND -- TO INCORPORATE EVALUATION I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT SAY THAT AS FROM UNIVERSITY. TO COLLECT DATA ON BEFORE AND AFTER OF TRAVELS LOUIS ACTUALLY CAN PROVIDE BETTER ESTIMATES BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SUBSTITUTION IS THANK YOU. THE NEXT WITNESS. HI LINDA COMMISSION WITH A CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION AND JUST HERE AT TO ASK -- FOR THIS PROGRAM TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE ARE EXPANDING MOBILITY OPTIONS TO REALLY BE INCLUSIVE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS WE CAN OFFER -- ARE A CONSTITUENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND REALLY GIVE THEM THE THE FAST AT ABILITY TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR THEMSELVES -- THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS PUT FORWARD VERY AMBITIOUS I GOALS COMICAL HEALTH GOALS AND WE REALLY WANT TO AT TAKE AT A ADVANTAGE OF EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO MEET THAT -- BICYCLING OFFERS MANY CO BENEFITS THE BICYCLING IS ONE OF THOSE WAYS THAT WE'RE GETTING MORE PEOPLE ON BIKES AND MORE OF THE TIME SO. I WOULD URGE FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU. OTHERS SPEAKERS IN FAVOR PLEASE. OTHERS SPEAKERS IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL YEAH -- I'M JOHN SWAN. PRESIDENT OF THE DAVIS BY CLUB. I'M A BICYCLE ADVOCATE AND I WAS -- A BIKE -- ANYBODY DEALER -- UP UNTIL LAST OCTOBER AND I WAS DOING THAT FOR ABOUT NINE YEARS -- THE THE BIKE IS INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT VEHICLE -- OF ELECTRIC CARS GET ON THE ORDER OF ONE TO TWO HUNDRED MILES PER GALLON. WHERE'S THE BIKES GET TWO TO THREE THOUSAND MILES PER GALLON EQUIVALENT -- THE TECHNOLOGY IS BEING EMBRACED -- MORE THAN I COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED WHEN I GOT INTO THE BUSINESS NINE YEARS AGO ON AN EVIDENCE OF THAT IS THE THE JUMP BIKES RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- THERE IT'S A BIKE SHARE PROGRAM WITH ELECTRIC BIKES -- AND THEIR OWN I THINK MOST PEOPLE KNOW THEIR OWN BY UBER AND THERE WAS AN ARTICLE THAT I READ SEVERAL MONTHS AGO THAT SAID IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA -- THEY HAD DURING A PARTICULAR PERIOD THEY HAD MORE. BIKE TRIPS ON THEIR JUMP BIKES AND THEY HAVE A UBER TRIPS IN THE CITY OF A SACRAMENTO -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AN ATHLETE AND IS SO GET IT ACTUALLY REALLY DOES GET MORE PEOPLE. ON AN OUT OF THEIR CARS AND WOULD NOT NORMALLY DO THAT -- AND THEIR SAFETY IN NUMBERS THERE'S BEEN STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THE MORE BICYCLES ON THE ROAD TO SAY FOR EVERYBODY IS BECAUSE THE CARS BECOME AWARE OF SIR OR JUST I THINK A TESTIMONY OKAY A FROM PEOPLE. WANT TO SAY THEIR FAVOR THE BILL I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF THIS AMENDMENT THANK YOU. SIR. THAT WOULD MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS LAURA BENNETT WITH CALIFORNIA VISORS ON BEHALF OF UBER I'M NOT SURE NEED TO SAY MUCH HE DECIDED FOR ME WE ARE IT'S PART OF SB FOUR HUNDRED THANK YOU IT.

AND IT ALLOWS -- ARB TO ENGAGE IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND TO SET FOR YOUR GOALS. NOW WHY BY INTRODUCED SB. FORTY FOUR CALIFORNIA IS STILL PLAGUED WITH DIRTY AIR AS MUCH AS WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP. SEVEN OUT OF THE TEN CITIES IN THE US WITH THE MOST POLLUTED AIR ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NOW WE ARE ALSO A STATE. TO FIRST WE WE ARE ONE OF THE FIRST WE ENACTED A CLEAN AIR ACT BEFORE THE U. S. GOVERNMENT DID -- BUT WE'VE ALSO BEEN LEADERS IN CLIMATE PROTECTION. NOW ONE OF THE KEY WAYS THAT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ADDRESS OUR AIR POLLUTION PROBLEMS AS WELL IS OUR GREENHOUSE GAS. PROBLEMS IS GETTING AT PETROLEUM BASED DIESEL. WHY BECAUSE THAT PARTICULAR FORM OF DIESEL IN OUR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES? CREATES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE PARTICULAR MATTER AND 33% OF CALIFORNIA'S SMOG CAUSING POLLUTION. AND 25% OF THE TOTAL EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION. SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL TO BRING SPECIAL ATTENTION. TO ASSISTING THE OPERATORS AND OWNERS OF HEAVY. DUTY AND MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLES SO THAT WE CAN GET THAT -- THAT FORMER POLLUTION AND HELP -- ELIMINATE IT -- THROUGH TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL [inaudible] INCENTIVES. THAT WOULD. HELP US MOVE TOWARDS IT SO WITH THAT I WILL HAVE MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SPEAK TO THE BILL. THANK YOU. HEARING MEMBERS ARE. ONE PUSH THE BUTTON THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS RIGHTS YOU AREN'T ON BEHALF CAL START WHERE TECHNOLOGY CONSORTIUM -- WORKING WITH AROUND TWO HUNDRED MEMBERS TO ACCELERATE THAT THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S AVERAGE JUST KIND OF GOES HAVE GIVEN RISE TO RENAISSANCE VEHICLE MANUFACTURING -- AS I DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY ON THAT SPRINT BRINGING A WHOLE SLEW OF MANUFACTURERS TO THE STATE INCLUDING PER TERAMO TO BE Y. DE AND AND SEVERAL OTHERS. THESE COMPANIES ARE JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG THAT COULD BE HERE FOR FOR WHAT'S TO COME FROM FROM OUR OUR CAP AND TRADE AND RELATED CLIMATE CHANGE UP PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. AS A RESULT OF THEIR WORK HERE A WHOLE NEW SET OF VEHICLE CLASSES AND MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING OR HAVE ALREADY BEEN BECOME COMMERCIALIZED. SB FORTY FOUR IS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP IN OUR STATE PLANNING EFFORTS TO KEEP RATCHETING DOWN A VEHICLE EMISSIONS AND SIGNAL TO MANUFACTURE THE WE ARE NOT BACKING DOWN OUR COMMITMENTS. BUSINESS THEY'RE MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS ON A LONG TERM BASIS IN THIS THE STATE IN AND IT NEEDS TO MORE MORE CLOSELY SYNCHRONIZE AN AMP AND PROVIDE PLANNING DIRECTION. THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INVESTMENT CYCLES OF THE INDUSTRY THIS DOING SO WOULD HELP TO BRING TO THE MARKET VEHICLES FASTER AND TO CONTINUE TO RUN MORE VEHICLES AND MANUFACTURES TO THE STATE. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OR DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON AS CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS ROCKY RUSSIAN WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR AND MY COMMENTS TODAY REFLECT SUPPORT FROM. THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION AND SEVENTEEN OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH RGANIZATIONS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT AIR POLLUTION CHALLENGES IN UNITED STATES. DESPITE REPRESENT A SMALL SHARE OF TOTAL ON ROAD VEHICLES HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES OF THE STATE'S LARGEST MOBILE SOURCE OF HARMFUL KNOCKS AND PM TWO POINT FIVE EMISSIONS. EMISSIONS FROM MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY. DIESEL TRUCKS ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO LOCAL AND REGIONAL POLLUTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH BURDENS INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESS CANCERS AND PREMATURE DEATH. LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FACE DISPROPORTIONATE BURDENS AND ELEVATED CANCER RISKS DUE TO NEARBY DIESEL HOT SPOT. SUCH AS PORTS IN WAREHOUSES. LOW INCOME. CHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO ADVERSE HEALTH IMPACTS OF PM AND KNOCKS FROM DIESEL TRUCKS AND WORKERS ALSO FACE GREATER RISKS DUE TO INCREASED EXPOSURES. DIESEL EXHAUST IS CLASSIFIED AS A TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT BY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND IS CLASSIFIED AS A HUMAN CARCINOGEN BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S INTERNATIONAL AGENCY. FOR RESEARCH -- CENTER ON CANCER. OVERWHELMINGLY EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT. BOB PRTICLE POLLUTION LIKE THAT COMING FROM DIESEL EXHAUST CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF HEART DISEASE LUNG CANCER ASTHMA ATTACKS AND GREATER USE OF ASTHMA MEDICATIONS AND CAN INTERFERE WITH GROWTH. AND WORK OF LUNGS. MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ARE ALSO A MAJOR SOURCE OF BLACK CARBON. CLIMATE POLLUTION THAT THREATENS HEALTH TODAY IN THAT OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS SB FORTY FOUR WOULD DIRECT CARP TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO IDENTIFY HOW THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE SECTORS CAN REDUCE DIESEL EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FIFTY RESPECTFULLY.

THEY HAVE -- BEEN MORE HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARDS OUR PASSENGER VEHICLES ENDS CLEARLY WE WANT TO CLEAN UP OUR ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM BUT GIVEN THE THE HARMFUL HEALTH IMPACTS OF THESE PARTICULAR VEHICLES IF THEY ARE. POWERED BY -- MORE POLLUTING DIESEL FUEL. I IT SEEMS LIKE WE GET AS THEY SAY A BIG BANG FOR OUR BUCK IF WE PUT MORE EMPHASIS TOWARDS TRYING TO SUPPORT. MOVING AWAY FROM THAT FUEL IN THE FOR THAT TECHNOLOGY EVEN DEPENDING ON HOW ONE CHOOSES TO DO IT. IN THIS MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SECTOR AND THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO ASSIST IN THAT PROCESS MOVE THE WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THE MOTION SIR ACCOUNTS COULD.

WE ACCEPT THE MA'AM AND COMMENT NINE WHICH WILL ALLOW AUTOMOBILE DELAY TO BE USED AS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. AND WE ACCEPT THE COMMENT THAT WITH IT WE ACCEPT THE MEMORY COMMON. SEVEN WHICH WOULD LEAVE THE REQUIREMENT FOR BICYCLE LANES ON SHOP PROJECTS BY THE FALL. AND INSTEAD REQUIRE CALTRANS TO INCLUDE THESE FACILITIES. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON CERTAIN SECTIONS OF HIGHWAY. THIS BILL IS -- PASSED OUT THE AMENDMENTS FOR EVERYBODY WRITTEN. SO WE GOT COPIES. THANK YOU CENTER I THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US MISTER CHAIRMAN VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. ON THIS BILL -- IT IS I SEE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD -- WE HAVE IN OUR STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA -- NUMEROUS -- HIGHWAY SEGMENTS QUOTE ON QUOTE THAT ARE ACTUALLY CITY SURFACE STREETS. WE HAVE THEM ALL OVER THE CITY WHETHER IT'S PORTIONS OF SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD WERE VENICE AVENUE OR NINETEENTH AVENUE IN SAN FRANCISCO OR SAN PABLO AVENUE IN THE SPARE. MANY PARTS OF HIGHWAY -- ONE WHERE IT'S A STATE HIGHWAY BUT IT'S REALLY THE MAIN STREET OF A CITY. AND SO PEOPLE ARE WALKING ON THE STREETS AND CROSSING THE STREET AND AND AND BIKING ON THOSE STREETS AND WAITING FOR THE BUS ON THE STREETS. UNFORTUNATELY CALTRANS HAS TYPICALLY TREATED THOSE STREETS AS IF THEY WERE JUST REGULAR OLD STATE HIGHWAYS -- WERE NO ONE'S WALKING OR BIKING. MAKES A VERY DANGEROUS AND SO -- WE HAVE SEGMENTS OF OUR STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM THAT OUR CITY STREETS AND HAVE NO SIDEWALKS OF DOING OF CROSSWALKS BUT DON'T HAVE AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO WAIT. FOR THE BUS OR TO BIKE -- AND THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE CALTRANS -- TO ACTUALLY WHEN THEY'RE DOING WORK IN THESE AREAS -- TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO INCORPORATE WHAT WE CALL COMPLETES THREE ELEMENTS -- STREET SAFETY FOR ALL USERS NOT JUST FOR CARS. I WANT TO SAY -- THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD WITH THIS BILL COLLEAGUES. TIME IS THAT -- WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET -- GOOD DATA FROM CALTRANS BACK CALTRANS HAS COMPLETELY FAILED TO GIVE US ANY DATA -- RELATING TO THESE PARTICULAR THREE FACILITIES THAT RUN THROUGH CITIES -- SURFACE STREETS -- I SENT A LETTER TO CALTRANS -- ABOUT A YEAR AGO REQUESTING THIS INFORMATION THE DEPARTMENT HAS -- FAILED. NOT DESPITE REPEATED FOLLOW UPS -- TO TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND SO I'VE DIRECTED MY STAFF JUST TO THE COMMITTEES INFORMATION -- TO SUBMIT AN AUDIT REQUESTS TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. THEY WANT TO INFORMALLY WILL GET IT THROUGH A FORMAL AUDIT. SB -- ONE TWO SEVEN INSURERS ARE CALTRANS CONSIDER THESE COMPLETE ST ELEMENTS SO THAT EVERYONE IS SAFE ON OUR STREETS. WE KNOW THAT -- CALTRANS THIS CONFERENCE IS SPENDING. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR -- TO FIX THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM AND I SUPPORT THAT WORK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DEPLOYING THOSE RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY -- IN THESE AREAS THAT RUN THROUGH CITIES. AND TOWNS -- SO THE BILL DOES A FEW THINGS A REQUIRES -- THAT -- WHEN CALTRANS AS HIS PROJECTS -- THAT A CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF ALL ROAD USERS -- AND SO FORTH -- SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME -- TODAY -- OR PAPA JOH VOLUNTEER AT AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION -- LYNN THE COMMISSION FROM OTHER CAL FROM CAL BIKE WHO'S HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS -- AND INNOVATIVE -- YOU SALAS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CULT OF CALL TO VOTE NOT SALUTE. A WITNESSES IN FAVOR PLEASE. AIR AND MEMBERS OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KIND OF A BY YOU SLICE I AM THE DIRECTOR OF COURSETHE BY LAST ALLUDE AND WE ARE A SMALL PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. THAT'S BEEN WORKING IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO CREATE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES I'M ALSO A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER FOR FRESNO UNIFIED ALTHOUGH I'M NOT HERE TO REPRESENT THE SCHOOL BOARD I AM HERE. TO GIVE VOICE TO MANY OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT I AND YOU REPRESENT IN THIS REGION. I GREW UP IN RURAL FRESNO COUNTY I WALK TO SCHOOL MOST OF MY CHILDHOOD EVERY DAY WAS A RISK LIKE MANY CHILDREN IN RURAL COMMUNITIES TODAY. I DIDN'T HAVE NICELY PAVED SIDEWALKS ARE BRIGHTLY PAINTED CROSSWALKS. THERE WERE A FEW NEAR MISSES BUT HERE I AM. THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHO DID NOT HAVE THE SAME LOT CAN I WON IT REMEMBER. DIEGO ESTRADA WHO WAS NINE YEARS OLD IN PART THEY'RE CALIFORNIA WHO WAS STRUCK ON HIS WAY TO SCHOOL. AMIN ABANG WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD SHE WAS CROSSING THE STREET TO CATCH THE BUS THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY TAKE HER TO SCHOOL. WHEN SHE WAS KILLED AND ERICA MEAN THOUGH WHO IS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD? HE WAS JUST A FEW STEPS FROM THE GATE OF HIS SCHOOL WHEN HE WAS STRUCK BY A VEHICLE. WE CN ARGUE ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DEATHS. BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROTECTED -- CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD NOT RELY ON LOCK THEY SHOULD RELY ON GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE -- FOR THEIR SAFETY. THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THE ODDS FOR MANY OF THE RURAL COMMUNITIES. THAT I REPRESENT. ENSURING THAT CALTRANS RESPONSIBLY WORKS TO CREATE COMPLETE STREETS ON ALL THE STREETS UNDER THEIR PURVIEW HELPS TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN PARTICULAR AND RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BISECTED BY THESE HIGHWAYS. ARE DUE TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL -- AT ONE TWENTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT REPLACES CHANCE WITH PREVENTION IT ALLOWS RURAL COMMUNITIES WHICH OFTEN STRUGGLE TO DRIVE DOWN GRANT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THEIR LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE. TO HAVE ONE LESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT IN RELATION T THOSE ROADS. WE'VE SEEN THIS WORK IN MODESTO ON THE SOMEBODY AVENUE AND IN STOCKTON ON HARM HAMMER LANE AND TURNED AWAY -- THIS BILL IS AN OBVIOUS SOLUTION TO A PRESSING NEED I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND I WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR ACTION ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIR THE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS PAPA JOE. AT THE VOLUNTEER THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION OUR HOLY THE SUPPORT. SB. ONE TWENTY SEVEN THIS BILL WILL HELP IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MAKING IT EASIER AND SAFER FOR THEM TO BE ACTIVE. TO THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION THE NEEDHAM BENEFITS COMPLETE STREETS OF CLEAR WALKING AND BICYCLING. AS A MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION OF DOUBLE BETWEEN 200-022-00012. BETWEEN 200-020-0012 CONSISTING NEARLY 20% OF TRIPS IN CALIFORNIA. URGING EVEN MORE CALIFORNIA'S TO WALK OR BIKE. UNNECESSARY OUTCOME FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT PERSONALLY. I HAVE BENEFITTED FROM COMPLETE STREETS. IF YOU SAW ME SIX YEARS AGO YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE ME. THAT'S BECAUSE IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS WALKING UP TO FIVE MILES A DAY RAIN OR SHINE MAKING THE SIDEWALK BY MY TREADMILL AND THE CITY MY GYM I LOST OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS BY WALKING. I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE I LIVED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH SIDEWALKS WHY FELT SAFE TO WALK. LATER OUR STARTER BIKE RIDING. AND UNFORTUNATELY IT HAD A ACCIDENT TWO YEARS AGO ON MAY I MET MAGNOLIA BOULEVARD AND MY QUESTION. WHERE THE SIGNS WERE NOT PROPERLY WHERE THE STREETS ROUTE PROPERLY SIGNED AND I WAS I WAS STRUCK BY A CAR? AS SOMEONE WITH BENEFITTED FROM ACCEPTS ACCEPTS ABILITIES TO SIDEWALKS AT THE SAME TIME HAVING SURVIVED A BICYCLE ACCIDENT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME TO HAVE THE STREETS WERE THE FATE FOR PEOPLE TO SHARE THE ROADS WITH CARS AND TRUCKS. YOU HAVE SHOWN PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN WALKABLE NEIGHBORHOODS GENERALLY GET MORE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY EACH WE CAN HAVE A LOWER RISK OF DEVELOPING DIABETES HEART DISEASE. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND SOME CANCERS WHO LIVE IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE LESS WALKABLE. WHEN OUR COMMUNITY HAVE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS ROADS -- AND PROTECTED BY CLAIMS AND ACCESS TO PARKS AND SIDEWALKS RESIDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO BIKE MORE. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY GIVEN LESS THAN HALF THE U. S. CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS WITH THE REQUIREMENT GUIDELINES OF LESS THAN 60%. OF EXERCISE SIXTY MINUTES OF EXERCISE EACH DAY. IN ADDITION TO THAT 10%. OF ADULTS MEET THE REQUIRED GUIDELINES OF AT LEAST THIRTY MINUTES. OF MODERATE TO VISIT VISIT BITS OF THIS VIGOROUSLY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY EVERY DAY. PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND ABILITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE SAFELY AND CONVENIENTLY WITH A LIVE. WORK GO TO SCHOOL AND PLAY. WE NEED ROADS THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE WHETHER YOU USE A WHEELCHAIR. RIGHT A BIKE. POR BRIGHTER TRAIN BUS OR TRAIN. OR DRIVE A CAR. THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ARJUN AYE ARE YOU A VOTE ON THIS BILL.

I'LL JUST SAY IT ON THE BIG PICTURE WAY WE AGREE WITH ALL THE POSITIVE AND SUPPORTING TESTIMONY TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PLANNING FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. ON URBANIZED STATE HIGHWAYS. THE REASON FOR OUR OPPOSITION THIS TODAY IN IT AND WE TAKE A LOT OF IT IS ADDRESSED IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE TAKEN. IS SEVERAL ELEMENTS OF THIS BILL ADDRESS THE STATE HIGHWAYS WHERE THERE ARE NO CYCLISTS ARE PEDESTRIANS ALLOWED THINGS LIKE AUXILIARY LANES IN AUTOMOBILE DELAY THAT ARE ON THE OTHER PORTION OF THOSE SOME OF THOSE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. WE THERE'S ONE OR TWO AREAS THAT I THINK THAT WILL STILL WORK WITH -- TO AUTHOR WITH AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN WE JUST WANTED TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE WHILE WE'RE ON THE SIDE TODAY WE APPRECIATE THE VERY IMPORTANT VALUES THAT YOU TESTIFIED ABOUT TODAY. AND THAT IS THAT WHEN WE CONCUR WITH THAT. IT'S JUST WHERE THIS BILL REACHED BEYOND THAT SCOPE THAT BRINGS US UP HERE TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MORE TOP ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY -- WE DO HAVE AN OF OFFICIAL OPPOSE POSITION -- BUT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- MORE DRESS TODAY -- THANK THE AUTHOR AND AND YOUR STAFF -- FOR TREMENDOUS WORK TO I THINK TAKE CARE OF THE BULK OF OUR MOST SERIOUS CONCERNS AS MISTER HIGGINS MENTIONED -- I THINK WE TO AGREE WITH THE NEED -- FOR GOOD SAFE COMPLETE STREETS -- BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE FROM A TRAIN FROM A TRULY TECHNICAL TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVE -- THERE WERE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU SEE IN THIS IN THE BILL -- EVEN IF IT'S COMING FROM -- OUT WITH US THAT WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON I THINK THAT WE ALL SHARE THE SAME GOALS -- AND AND AND WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE -- TO TO FINE TUNE THE BILL JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE SO IT DOESN'T HAVE THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES THANK YOU -- OTHERS SPEAKERS IN IN OPPOSITION. OKAY QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMITTEE. THE RUBIO SIR WHAT COUNTS THE NUMBER. SEVERAL. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- I PERSONALLY HAVE EXPERIENCED THE BENEFITS OF COMPETE STREETS AND I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. AS IT PERTAINS TO AREAS WERE SCHOOLS IN KIDS SEEN ALL HARM. I A WALK AROUND SO I APPRECIATE THE STORIES BECAUSE THEY WERE SO A COUPLE OF INCIDENTS IN MY COMMUNITY AS WELL BUT I ALSO KNOW THE RISK CONCERNS AND FROM WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING THAT COULD -- THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT. SOME OF THESE CONCERNS AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT THAT YOU ALSO THANK YOU WITH THAT MOVE THE BILL THINKING. M. I'M READING ON THAT AMENDMENTS AT ONE FOUR FIVE TO SIX POINT. EIGHT DOESN'T MENTION. URBAN I STREET TO JUST MENTIONS THE STATE PROJECT. OUR STATE PROJECT THE CROSSES A LOCAL STREET AND THEN YOU GIVE SORT OF A KNOCKED OUT YOU HAVE A HEARING. IT SO IT'S THE BURDEN IS ON THE LOCAL AGENCY TO SHOW THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE OPT OUT FROM. FROM THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION IS AT MY UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF THE MEN'S. I THINK THAT I THINK THAT'S CORRECT YEAH. TO SHOW ALL THE SHOP FUNDING BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WOULD BE SUBJECT TO IT BUT YOU HAVE TO OPT OUT. AND JUST TO CLARIFY THIS IS NOT LOCAL AGENCIES IT'S THE DISTRICT THIS IS A DISTRICT RIGHT SKEWS ME. ADS SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY OPT OUT AND AGAIN THIS IS THE SECTION WHERE SENATOR AT WIENER MENTIONED THAT WE DID NOT GET THAT THE DATA WE NEEDED FROM CALTRANS. AND SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S A BED. NOT MAYBE SOME CLARITY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING -- FOR BUT AS IT IS RIGHT NOW THIS IS. IT'S A LIMITATION TO THE PLACES THAT ARE MAIN STREETS -- AN URBANIZED AREAS AND RURAL AREAS WHERE STATE HIGHWAYS GOING THROUGH AND THAT'S THE MAIN STREET ACROSS NOW WE'VE WE'RE WE WILL. ONCE WE GET THAT DATA -- WE CAN WORK TO REFINE THE DEFINITION EVEN MORE. OKAY SERVE THE RIGHT I GET YOUR SEVEN SUBPARAGRAPH C. INCLUDES THAT PROVIDED BY THE DAY THE DATA [inaudible] THEY WROTE. TWO SIX THE NAME ROAD AND SENATE DISTRICT MISSION BOULEVARD AND HAYWARD -- SIXTY TWO ALL RIGHT RIGHT THROUGH WILL FIGHT ON MOVE THE BILL. FOURTEEN WE ARE LOW HERE. WE WE WE ALLOW THE STREETS IN SAN JOSE WHERE THERE IS A STATE HIGHWAY. GOING RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND NEIGHBORHOODS. SO WHAT WE DID IS WE WENT TO CALTRANS AND SAID WE WANT YOU TO RELINQUISH THESE ROADS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID WE GOT WE GOT TO TOOK OVER THEIR INNOCENCE TOOK OVER. ELIMINATE THE STATE HIGHWAY COMPLETELY AND JUST TOOK OVER AS LOCAL ROADS AND THAT WAY. WE HAD COMPLETE CONTROL OVER HIM. HOWEVER THERE'S SOME ROADS. THE WE CAN'T REALLY. REALISTICALLY DO THAT. SO THERE HAS TO BE A WAY. FOR THESE LOCAL SAFETY BY SCHOOL SAFETY OTHER KIND OF PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. COMMUNITY. EURO ORIENTED PROJECTS CAN BE DONE S. THAT'S WE GOT WE GOT NOW WITH THESE AMENDMENTS WEEKLY WHERE WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. WITH CALTRANS IN THESE LOCAL ORDERS MISTER CHAIR YOU DID IT BACK IN THE DAY WHEN. CALTRAIN HAD TO RELINQUISH THE ROADS IN GOOD A STATE OF GOOD REPAIR. THE LAST TWO BILLS THAT I RAN ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM I JUST TOOK THEM AS THEY WERE BEAT UP FOR YOU SHOULD. ASK FOR MONEY GROUND AS WE DO WE GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT THE RECESSION BROUGHT ON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF FINANCE I'M NOT SURE IF YOU OF OKAY CENTER RUBIO AN ANSWER NUMBER. DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION. YES IT IS OKAY. ALERT ALL OF HIM AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK TO CENTER RING. SO US AND WE ARE THANK YOU -- I'VE REVIEWED THE AMENDMENTS APPRECIATE THAT I ASSUME THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS THOUGH. THE RIGHT. EVERY BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT NOT BUT IT'LL YOU KNOW WHAT IT AYE AYE. YEAH SO I HAVE STATE ARE YOU STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO FOR EXAMPLE ORANGE COUNTY WHICH IS LARGELY COMMUTER -- AREA AND IN TERMS OF PRIVATIZATION IN TERMS OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO SPEND OUR PRECIOUS RESOURCES I AM HOPEFULNESS PORTABLE BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- SOME COMMUNITIES ARE NOT -- DE PRIORITIZED. YEAH I DON'T KNOW I PRETTY I MEAN THAT THE CLICK OF MY LAST -- ANSWER -- BUT YOU KNOW. AB. THE INTENT IS NOT TO BE PRIORITIZE COMMUNITIES AND EVEN IN THE VERSION OF THE BILL -- BEFORE THEM AND THEN WE PUT SAFETY. AS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY WHICH I DON'T CARE WHAT COUNTY YOU'RE AND YOU KNOW ORANGE COUNTY VALUE SAFETY AS MUCH OF SAN FRANCISCO OR LOS ANGELES WE ALL VALUE IT -- FOR ALL USERS A WE WANNA -- BUT YOU KNOW I THINK CALTRANS CAN DO BOTH IN THEIR DIFFERENT NEEDS AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL FORMAL HIGHWAY IN. GETTING PEOPLE WERE THERE GOING OFFICIALLY AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT CALTRANS IS. ACTUALLY WORKING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES FOR THOSE STREETS AND INTERACT WITH PEDESTRIANS AND TRANSIT RIDERS IN CYCLES SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT LOOKING. TO TAKE AWAY AND I THINK PARTICULAR WITH THE AMENDMENTS -- IN EUROPE BUT I'M INTERPRETING IS YOUR POTENTIAL CONCERNS. HAVE. POTENTIALLY BEEN ADDRESSED SO ONE OH MITIGATED MEDICAID AND I WERE UP AROUND HAPPY TO TAKE FOR THE PEOPLE FROM THE ONES YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY. LOOK AT IT MORE CLOSELY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M I'M SORRY. THANK YOU I JUST FELT SAID TO MENTION AND DIE I SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION ABOUT -- CALTRANS AND I'M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED FOUND DATING BACK TO YOU -- THAT MAKES YOUR JOB HARDER IN OUR JOB HARDER BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION WE NEED AND ARE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT I FIND THAT THEY'RE SLOW TO RESPOND IN SOME DOUBT THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE ON INTENT I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT FOR THE RECORD I THINK.
