CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND

00:49:12.182 --> 00:49:13.283
RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.685
BILL MANY APOLOGIES FOR THE

00:49:14.751 --> 00:49:16.019
LATENESS OF OUR OPPOSITION AND

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:17.921
FOR NOT HAVING A LETTER AND BUT

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:20.157
WE DO HAVE PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:21.825
OBJECTIONS TO NOT JUST.

00:49:21.892 --> 00:49:22.993
ESSENTIALLY PUTTING TAXPAYERS ON

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:23.694
THE HOOK FOR EMPLOYER

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.962
RESPONSIBILITY BUT ALSO I THINK

00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:27.764
MORE TO THE POINT THAT WHILE

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:29.132
KOBE DEFINITELY PLAYED A ROLE IN

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:30.634
THE SIZE OF THIS DEBT THE

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:31.601
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM HERE'S THE

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:33.970
INSOLVENCY OF OUR SYSTEM. AND IF

00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:35.472
IT IS NOT COVERED IT'S A

00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:37.040
RECESSION IT'S ANY NUMBER OF

00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:38.141
OTHER THINGS WAITING IN THE

00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:40.143
WINGS THAT COULD CAUSE US TO

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.578
GENERATE ANOTHER MASSIVE DEBT TO

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:42.813
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.214
WOULD THEN NEED A MASSIVE

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:45.849
INTEREST PAYMENT FROM THE STATE.

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:47.184
WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT ANY

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.219
SORT OF BAIL OUT OF THIS SIZE

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:50.320
SHOULD DEFINITELY COME WITH THE

00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:51.355
FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE

00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:53.390
SYSTEM TO PREVENT THIS SORT OF

00:49:53.457 --> 00:49:55.225
THAT FROM BEING GENERATED IN

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:56.927
FUTURE WE ALSO THINK THAT IT

00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:58.128
ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE MENTIONED

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:01.131
THAT BENEFIT LEVELS IN THE STATE

00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:02.432
ARE WILDLY INADEQUATE THE RIGHT.

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:04.101
NOT FOUR HUNDRED FOR MAXIMUM

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:05.969
BENEFIT AMOUNT HAS BEEN IN PLACE

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:10.340
FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS. 40% OF

00:50:10.407 --> 00:50:12.109
WORKERS HIT THAT MAXIMUM CAP AND

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:13.343
AS A PAINT AWARE FOUR HUNDRED

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.712
FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK IS NOT

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:16.680
NEARLY ENOUGH TO FUND EVEN YOUR

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:17.347
HOUSING RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:18.815
STATE MUCH LESS EVERYTHING ELSE

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:20.350
THAT YOU NEED TO PAY FOR AS A

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:22.586
CITIZEN OF THE STATE. AND SO WE

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:24.087
REALLY BELIEVE THAT ANY SORT OF

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:25.922
A LOT OF THE SITE SHOULD COME

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:27.023
WITH AN INCREASE IN BENEFIT

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:28.358
LEVELS FOR WORKERS- A REFORM

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:29.926
FUNDING STRUCTURE SO THAT WERE

00:50:29.993 --> 00:50:30.794
BETTER ABLE TO WITHSTAND

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:31.695
WHATEVER RECESSIONS ARE COMING

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:33.530
IN THE FUTURE. AND ALSO SOME

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:35.732
SORT OF A SOLVENCY SURCHARGE

00:50:35.799 --> 00:50:36.933
THAT OTHER STATES HAVE TO MAKE

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.169
SURE THAT IF WE DO NEED TO PAY

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:41.138
OFF INTEREST ON A FEDERAL LOAN

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:42.439
THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF PAYS FOR

00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:44.274
THAT THE EMPLOYERS PAY FOR THAT.

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:46.042
RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO BACK TO

00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:47.277
TAXPAYERS TO COVER THAT

00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:49.446
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE REASONS

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:51.348
WERE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU

00:50:51.415 --> 00:50:54.184

MR VOCALS- CONCERNS IN IN

01:38:14.021 --> 01:38:18.659
POSITION ON. I THINK THAT WHAT

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.995
GOT YOUR ATTENTION AND- AGAIN I

01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:23.297
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS WHAT

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:24.765
COLOR YOUR ENTIRE VIEWPOINT OF

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:25.899
WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID BUT BUT

01:38:25.966 --> 01:38:27.534
WHAT YOU LEAD WITH WAS. WHEN DID

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:30.904
THE CONTRIBUTIONS OCCUR. AND THE

01:38:30.971 --> 01:38:32.940
CONTRIBUTIONS AREN'T ACTUALLY

01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:34.975
THE POINT OF THIS BILL THE

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:36.010
COUNTRY SINCE EARLY HAVE NO

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:37.978
IMPACT ON THIS BILL THE

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:39.213
CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ACTUALLY JUST

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.782
A MINOR PART. OF THE STORY. IT

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:47.021
WAS WHAT I DREW PEOPLE TO ASK

01:38:47.087 --> 01:38:48.956
FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT

01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:52.326
COMMUNICATIONS. WE WITHOUT THAT

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:55.429
WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE PUBLIC

01:38:55.496 --> 01:38:56.430
RECORDS ACT REQUEST TO

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:58.032
UNDERSTAND. YES IT COULD

01:38:58.098 --> 01:39:00.567
CONTRIBUTIONS HAPPENED BUT THERE

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:02.836
WAS A SIGNIFICANT OVERRULING OF

01:39:02.903 --> 01:39:04.705
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:08.008
DEALING WITH THAT THAT DONOR. SO

01:39:08.075 --> 01:39:10.644
WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WASN'T THE

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:12.746
CONTRIBUTION WHAT WAS IMPORTANT

01:39:12.813 --> 01:39:15.616
WHAT IS IMPORTANT. WHAT ARE THE

01:39:15.683 --> 01:39:17.918
MEETINGS THAT OCCURRED THAT LED

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:20.688
TO OVERTURNING STAFF. THESE ARE

01:39:20.754 --> 01:39:21.955
PEOPLE WHO ARE DEDICATED

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:23.757
PROFESSIONALS IN THEIR CAREERS

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:25.693
REGULATING A THREE HUNDRED

01:39:25.759 --> 01:39:26.527

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:32.766
WERE THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT'S

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.168
WHAT THIS BILL GETS TO IT'S NOT

01:39:34.234 --> 01:39:36.070
ABOUT THE POLITICS OF CAMPAIGN

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:38.372
CONTRIBUTIONS. WE JUST DON'T

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:39.673
KNOW WHAT THOSE COMMUNICATIONS

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:42.042
ARE SO IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND

01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:43.811
LIKE WHY. PUT AN INSURANCE

01:39:43.877 --> 01:39:46.213
COMPANY THAT OVER CHARGED SMALL

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.349
BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WHY

01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:50.451
WOULD THEY BE LET OFF THE HOOK.

01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:52.286
WHEN ALL OF THE STAFF REGULATORS

01:39:52.353 --> 01:39:53.287
SAY THAT THEY SHOULD BE HELD

01:39:53.354 --> 01:39:55.489
ACCOUNTABLE YOU NEED TO KNOW

01:39:55.556 --> 01:39:59.393
WHAT COMMUNICATIONS OCCURRED.

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:00.828
ALL RIGHT SIR ANY OTHER

01:40:00.894 --> 01:40:02.730

ARCHER WHO HAD MISTER MAYES- I

01:40:05.466 --> 01:40:07.167
THINK THAT THE AUTHORS UP.

01:40:07.234 --> 01:40:09.570
PURPOSE IN THIS- IS IN

01:40:09.636 --> 01:40:11.805
TRYING TO- TO WRITE SOMETHING HE

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:14.608
SEES AS A AS A WRONG- I JUST

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:16.343
HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN SUPPORTED

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:18.245
IN BACK ON MY TIME. AS A CITY

01:40:18.312 --> 01:40:19.413
COUNCILMEMBER WHEN DEALING WITH

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:21.048
EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS AS IT

01:40:21.115 --> 01:40:21.482
APPLIED TO PLANNING

01:40:21.548 --> 01:40:23.117
COMMISSIONERS. OF THE FIRST

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:25.152
MEMBER THE U. S. CONSTITUTION IS

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:27.921
VERY VERY CLEAR- AND ONE OF THE

01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:29.189
MOST FUNDAMENTAL PARTS OF OUR

01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:30.057
GOVERNMENT IS THE ABILITY TO

01:40:30.124 --> 01:40:32.025
BUILD A PETITION- ELECTED

01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:34.228
REPRESENTATIVES- WHEN I HAVE A

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:35.729
CONSTITUENT THE COMES. AND MEETS

01:40:35.796 --> 01:40:37.765
WITH ME AND THAT CONVERSATION

01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:38.665
THAT I HAVE WITH THAT

01:40:38.732 --> 01:40:40.033

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.402
PRIVATE BETWEEN ME AND THEM AND

OF THOSE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND

01:40:45.939 --> 01:40:47.975
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE- FOR

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:49.176
ELECTED OFFICIALS TO BE ABLE TO

01:40:49.243 --> 01:40:50.978

THAT ARE PETITIONING THEM AND I

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.248
THINK THE RULES THAT WE HAVE IN

01:40:54.314 --> 01:40:56.383
PLACE IN REGARDS THE PUBLIC

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:57.551
RECORDS ACT AND OTHER THINGS- IS

01:40:57.618 --> 01:40:59.887
MORE THAN ENOUGH- THAT THEN AND

01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:01.388
I THINK THIS JUST GOES. A GOES

01:41:01.455 --> 01:41:04.358
TOO FAR SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING
