00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:03.396
SUPERVISORS FOR SIXTEEN YEARS

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:04.063
ENDED.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.731
GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS AND SO.

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:05.932
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:06.833
COMPLIANCE PART FOR CITIES AND

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:07.834
COUNTIES THAT ARE IN COMPLIANCE

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.568
AND AND YOU KNOW THAT.

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:09.435
IF YOU HAVE A GENERAL PLAN THAT

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:10.603
IS IN CONFORMANCE AND YOU DON'T

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.472
MEET YOUR HOUSING -- ELEMENT

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:16.209
IT'S QUITE FRANKLY 99% THE TIME

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:17.210
IT'S DUE TO THE FACT THAT.

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:19.879
DEVELOPERS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:21.614
OF THIS IS THAT THE PLAN THE

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.282
GENERAL PLAN OPTIONS BECAUSE

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:24.751
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO GET A

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:25.384
RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT AND

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:27.120
THAT SO I'VE I'VE RAN THE TRAP

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.188
LINE ON QUITE A FEW OF THE

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:30.423
COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.558
AND THE COST IS SO HIGH THAT

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:33.793
THERE'S TOO MUCH RISK AND THAT'S

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.394
WHY WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF HOUSES

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:36.763
BUILT QUITE FRANKLY IN.

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:39.398
ALL OF CALIFORNIA SO NOW WE'RE

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.000
GONNA GO IN AND AND COMPOUND

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.502
THAT EVEN MORE SO LOCAL

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:43.703
JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE THE

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.772
ABILITY TO RAISE TAXES TO PAY

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:47.974
EVEN FIND SUED -- IF IF THEY'RE

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.643
GONNA COME IN.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.911
AND I KNOW YOU'E TRYING.

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:52.512
TO COURAGE THEM ALONG.

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:53.646
THROUGH WITH THE PROCESS THAT

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:54.714
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I I

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:55.548
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT AT THE END

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:56.149
OF THE DAY.

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:57.617
IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BUILD

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:59.986
THOSE HOMES NOW -- INTEL WE

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:00.586
DRIVE THE COST OF THOSE HOMES

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:03.322
DOWN -- SOMEHOW -- YOU'RE NOT

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.590
GONNA GET MORE HOMES WERE GONNA

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:06.325
BE THE SAME THAT'S WHY THEY'RE

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:06.926
NOT BUILDING HOSE AUS BECAUSE

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:08.394
DEVELOPERS -- THERE'S TOO BIG OF

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.630
A RISK AND THEY DON'T GET A

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:11.931
RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT.

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:13.032
SO I IT'S LIKE CONTINUE TO GO

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:13.966
AFTER.

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:15.234
CITIES AND COUNTIES DON'T BUILD

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.837
HOUSES WE INCENTIVIZE YES HAT

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:19.038
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.406
WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA PUT MONEY

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:23.376
INTO SIN OF EYES -- HOUSING

00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:25.244
WHICH IS -- IT WILL BE HELPFUL

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:26.512
IN DRIVING THAT COST DOWN BUT

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.248
THERE'S THAT MONEY'S COMING FROM

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:30.183
TAXPAYERS SO.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.551
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:33.920
HAVING A HAMMER ON CITIES AND

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:36.355
COUNTIES -- BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:37.023
THEY'RE NOT THE REALLY THE ONES

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.659
THAT BUILD HOMES AS DEVELOPERS

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:41.327
TO BUILD HOMES.

00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:42.862
I THINK I'LL MAKE A COUPLE BRIEF

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:43.930
POINTS IN MY COLLEAGUE DANIELLE

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.431
MAY WANT TO WEIGH IN AS WELL --

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:46.799
THE FIRST THING IS FOR THIS

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:48.401
SPECIFIC LAW THAT HOUSING

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:50.803
ELEMENT -- IT'S NOT REALLY

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.238
FOCUSED ON THAT PRODUCTION

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.472
ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE GOAL TO GET

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:54.440
THESE HOUSES.

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:55.842
BUILT IN THE AND OF COURSE

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:56.876
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT AND THIS IS

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.311
PART OF THAT BUT WHEN I SAY IT'S

00:07:58.377 --> 00:07:59.545
NOT FOCUSED ON THAT THE

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:00.813
JURISDICTIONS DON'T ACTUALLY

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.781
HAVE.

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:03.249
TO PRODUCE THE HOUSES IN ORDER

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.383
TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW THIS IS

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.552
EVEN WELL BEFORE THAT IT SIMPLY.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:07.687
PUTTING TOGETHER A PLAN AND

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:08.921
MAKING PLANNING AND ZONING

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.590
DECISIONS THAT ARE IN COMPLIANCE

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:12.391
WITH HOUSING ELEMENT LAWS SO

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:14.026
IT'S MUCH MORE BEFORE --

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:15.528
DEVELOPERS SAY HEY IT'S

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:17.196
EXPENSIVE TO BUILD YOUR END PART

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:18.264
OF THE LAW AND YOU MENTIONED

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:19.498
IT'S INCENTIVES AS WELL WITH THE

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:20.333
INFO INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.801
PROGRAM OFTEN DEVELOPERS DON'T

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:22.902
WANT TO BUILD BECAUSE THE

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.170
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:25.771
BUILDING IS IN REALLY THERE SO

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:26.372
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.040
SUPPORT TEIR BUT THIS.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:30.243
IS BEFORE THEN EXISTING LAW JUST

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.943
SAYING WHAT STATE HOUSING

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.478
ELEMENT LAW YOU SHOULD PUT

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:33.679
TOGETHER A PLAN AND EXCITING

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:35.381
DECISIONS THAT COMPLY WITH THAT

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:36.649
WHETHER DEVELOPERS ARE OTHERS

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:37.683
BUILD OR NOT.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.352
AND THEN I THINK THE SECOND PART

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:40.419
IS YOU MENTIONED SOME THESE

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:41.721
JURISDICTIONS EVERYONE IS IN A

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:43.623
DIFFERENT SITUATION SO AS PART

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.124
OF THE REMEDIES INCLUDING THOSE

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.425
THAT ARE A LAST RESORT.

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:48.127
BUT THERE IS A PART OF THE BILL

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.528
THAT ALLOWS FOR MITIGATING

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:50.863
CIRCUMSTANCES OF JURISDICTION

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.865
DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:53.966
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:54.967
ABOUT IN THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:56.535
EMERGENCY SITUATIONS IN ON

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:57.236
PARADISE.

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:58.070
THIS LAW IS NOT GOING TO BE

00:08:58.137 --> 00:08:59.772
ENFORCED AGAINST THE COMMUNITY

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:00.373
LIKE THAT WHEN THEY'RE COMING

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:02.308
OUT OF THAT DISASTER LIKE THAT

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.809
SO THERE IS SOME DISCRETION FOR

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:09.015
THE JUDGE TO MAKE THOSE TYPES OF

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:10.483
DETERMINATIONS.

00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:11.884
SO IS THERE ANY FUNDS AVAILABLE

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:13.352
ENTERED ACTUALLY HELP THEM.

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:14.987
WITH THEIR THEIR GENERAL PLAN

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:16.522
AMENDMENTS.

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:18.791
SO GENERALLY REVIEW THAT TWO

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:19.558
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:20.393
THAT'S GOING TO LOCAL%

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.328
JURISDICTIONS AS PROVIDING THE

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.697
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- TO COME

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:27.600
UP WITH THESE PLANS.

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.135
OKAY THANK YOU.

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.336
THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.538
QUESTIONS SENATOR MORLOCK.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- IS

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.775
THERE ANY INTEGRATION WITH NO

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:38.711
PLACE LIKE HOME -- WE'RE TRYING

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:40.780
TO BUILD HOUSING WITH PROP TO

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:42.448
FIND SO I'M I'M WONDERING IF WE

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:43.649
CAN DO SOME BLENDING SO WE GET A

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:45.017
BONUS TO SOME OF THESE

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:50.356
COMMUNITIES.

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:51.390
GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL FRIEND OF

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:54.093
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND NO

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.395
PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDS SHOULD BE

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:57.463
DEPLOYED THE SIDE.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.564
THEY HAVE BEEN APPLIED UP MY

00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:00.333
APOLOGIES -- THIS LATE LAST

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:02.702
SPRING AND THE USES ARE SIMILAR

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:03.636
TO SOME OF THESE OTHERS AND THEY

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:05.738
CAN BE USED N COMBINATION WITH

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:09.408
OTHER FUNDS -- TO BASICALLY

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:11.644
BUILD HOT HOUSING ENTRANCES FROM

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:12.678
HOUSING.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:14.246
AND JUST FROM A ANOTHER QUESTION

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:15.381
DIFFERENT SUBJECT BUT JUST FROM

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.016
AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT IF IF WE

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:18.818
KNOW THIS.

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.820
THE FUSION OF FUNDING IS

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:22.421
BECOMING AVAILABLE WITH THAT.

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:24.490
KEEP THE PRICE OF RAW LAND THESE

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:26.058
INFILL PROPERTIES WITH THAT KEEP

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.960
IT STABLE WOULD INCREASE IT

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:29.662
WOULD DECREASE IT BUT IT.

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:31.330
GIVE A LIKE I'M AN ECONOMIC

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:33.299
MODEL ON WHAT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN.

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:34.967
SO YOU'RE TALKING SPECIFICALLY

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:36.836
ABOUT THE EXISTING PRICE OF LAND

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:38.671
WITHOUT DEVELOPMENT ON IT RIGHT

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:40.139
IF I HAD SOME INSTILL PROPERTY

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:42.008
I'M THINKING IF THERE IS A STATE

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:43.175
PROGRAM COMING WITH SOME FINDING

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:44.710
I MIGHT WANT TO HOLD OUT FOR A

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.812
HIGHER PRICE.

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:48.748
SO I THINK THE WHAT WITH THE WAY

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.149
WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:52.418
IS BY -- RIGHT NOW IN A LOT OF

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.953
THESE WELL ON ON THIS LAND IT'S

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.888
NOT SIT SIMPLY NOT ZONED FOR

00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:56.789
HOUSING.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:58.924
SO YOU KNOW WHERE IS THAT ONE

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:00.659
SPECIFIC PROPERTY IF YOU ZONE IT

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:02.728
FOR ADDITIONAL USES ON IT COULD

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.163
POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE VALUE

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.898
OF THAT LAND BUT IT'S THE

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.800
OVERALL SUPPLY -- HOUSING IN

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:09.568
CALIFORNIA IS INCREASED THAT

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:13.606
SHOULD IN ARGUE MAKE UP HOUSES

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:14.874
HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.443
AND THEN -- MY LAST QUESTION --

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.779
WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT MORAN.

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.481
IT IS MARIN EXEMPTED.

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:23.449
SO I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.051
ANYTHING IN THIS BILL BEFORE YOU

00:11:25.117 --> 00:11:27.053
REGARDING MORAN.

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:27.620
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S IN THE

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:29.188
SPILL.

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:33.759
THEY'RE ALWAYS SPECIAL.

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:35.294
THANK YOU MENTOR YOU'RE WELCOME

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.797

ASK YOU TO FLESH OUT THE

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:44.870
SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE.

FRAMEWORK AND HELP US REALLY

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.140
UNDERSTAND WHAT.

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:49.508
WHAT SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:51.510
MEANS VERSUS JUST TO RESTRICT

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:52.878
FRAME OR CAN YOU?

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:55.748
HELP ELABORATE YES SO THE WAY AT

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:56.949
THE ADMINISTRATION AND WORKING

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.317
WITH NUMBERS THE LEGISLATURE

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.252
THINKING ABOUT THIS IS WE WANT

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:02.154
TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE'RE

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.389
BRINGING JURISDICTIONS INTO

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:05.224
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW -- BUT

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.425
WE ALSO WANT TO JURISDICTIONS TO

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:07.993
UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE NOT

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.662
GOING THAT NICKEL AND DIME THEM

00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:10.930
OR HIT THEM FOR EVERY LAST

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:12.798
VIOLATION WE WANT THEM TO COMPLY

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.300
AND THE PENALTIES ARE ONLY.

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:15.734
IF THEY NOT ONLY DON'T COMPLY

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:17.803
BUT AFTER A PERIOD OF AT LEAST

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.171
ONE TO ONE AND A HALF YEARS.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.506
AFTER THE JUDGE ISSUES THEIR

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.341
FINAL ORDER THEY'RE STILL NOT IN

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.509
COMPLIANCE TO THE REASON WE USE

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:24.810
THE TERM SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:26.946
IS WE WANNA JURISDICTIONS TO

00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:29.014
KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE BASICALLY

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:30.449
DOING THE RIGHT THING YOU KNOW

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:31.684
MAYBE THERE'S A CERTAIN PARTY OR

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.552
PLANNED IT DOESN'T EXACTLY

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:34.186
ALIGNED.

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:35.855
WITH WHAT HCV HAD IMAGINED AT

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.424
THE OUTSET -- BUT THE COURT SEES

00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:40.226
IT AS THEIR THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:41.260
FOLLOW THE LAW THERE MAKING A

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:42.628
GOOD FAITH EFFORT THAT THEY

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:43.429
HADN'T MADE BEFORE.

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:44.396
AND THAT BRINGS YOU INTO

00:12:44.463 --> 00:12:45.531
SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.500
LAW SO IT GOES BACK TO THAT

00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:48.534
PURPOSE THAT WE WANT YOUR

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.969
SECTIONS TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:51.971
EVEN AT THE END OF THIS REMEDY

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.439
ACCORD ABOUT IMPOSED REMEDY WE

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:55.074
STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:55.875
ARE WORKING WITH THEM AND NOT

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:57.843
SIPLY FILING LAWSUITS AGAINST

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.477
THEM.

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:00.079
SO SO WHAT FACTORS PLAY INTO

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:01.680
THAT DETERMINATION THAT HAVE

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.048
SORT OF A GOOD FAITH EFFORT AT

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:06.118
AND DID EFFORTS TOWARDS THE UP

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:08.120
PLANNING UPDATE IT MEANS OR WHAT

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:09.155
WHAT FACTORS ARE IN THIS YEAR I

00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:10.322
JUST WONDER WHAT THE COURTS

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:12.258
WOULD LOOK TO IN TERMS OF NOT

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:12.491
BEING.

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:15.694
TOTAL -- STRICT CONSTRUCTIONIST

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:18.030
ON EXACTLY WHAT MAKES SENSE.

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:18.697
SERVER.

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:19.431
THEY'RE THEY'RE I THINK THEY'RE

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:20.833
TWO THINGS TO NOTE ONE IS THAT

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.868
THE COURT WITH A LOOK AT AND SAY --

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:24.270
IS YOUR PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.471
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.473
BEFORE YOU KNOW BECAUSE WHEN YOU

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.909
THINK ABOUT WHY EVEN BRINGS --

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:31.043
THE LAWSUIT INTO PLACES ONLY

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.912
AFTER THESE TWO MEETINGS IT'S

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.947
AFTER A NOTICE DAN DIA TOURNEY

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:45.191
GENERAL FILES A LAWSUIT AND THEN

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:46.058
THERE'S A WHOLE COURT HEARING

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:47.059
BEFORE THE COURT IMPOSES ITS

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:47.326
JUDGMENT.

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:47.927
AND SO PRESUMABLY THINGS ARE

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:48.460
ONLY GETTING TO THAT POINT

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:49.395
BECAUSE THERE IS A PRETTY WIDE

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:50.763
GULF BETWEEN THE LAW AS

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:52.131
INTERPRETED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:52.798
HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT.

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:53.532
AND HOW THE JURISDICTION IS

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:54.900
ACTING SO IF THERE IS A BIG

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:55.467
SWITCH IN THE JURISDICTIONS

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:56.068
BEHAVIOR WITHIN THAT ONE YEAR

00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:57.636
AFTER THE JUDGMENT IS ENTERED.

00:13:57.703 --> 00:13:58.370
DAN YOU KNOW CERTAINLY COURT

00:13:58.437 --> 00:13:58.971
WOULD LOOK AT THAT AS A BIG

00:13:59.038 --> 00:13:59.838
FACTOR IN COMPLIANCE IN WHETHER

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:01.073
IT'S SUBSTANTIAL IS UP TO THE

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.441
DISCRETION OF THE COURT -- BUT

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.342
THEY WOULD BE WEIGHING THOSE

00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:04.877
FACTORS AND THEN I THINK THE

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:06.212
SECOND IS THAT THE COURT IN

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:07.446
ASSESSING ANY PENALTIES AND I

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:09.048
KNOW WE DISCUSSED THIS BRIEFLY

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:10.382
WHAT LOOK AT ANY MITIGATING

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:12.518
CIRCUMSTANCES -- AND SO DOES

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:13.385
COULD BEAT IN TERMS OF THE

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:15.588
RESOURCES THE JURISDICTION HAS

00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:17.423
ANY EXTERNAL EVENTS -- ANY

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:18.958
CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING THERE

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:19.925
SERVING ALL THESE FACTORS WAY

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:21.794
INTO WHAT THAT SUBSTANTIAL

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.596
COMPLIANCE STANDARD IS THANK YOU

00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:27.266
THANK YOU.

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.568
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN.

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:30.603
AS WE'VE ADDRESSED THE HOMELESS

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:31.971
SO OVER THE YEARS AND THERE BEEN

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:33.072
MANY BILLS THIS IS JUST ANOTHER

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:36.075
AND CONTINUE ON IS THERE

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:37.076
ANYTHING IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:39.345
LEGISLATION.

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:40.980
IT WOULD HELP DIRECT THE

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:42.615
HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL.

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.883
TOWARDS RESOURCE NOT JUST THE

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.585
HOUSING WHERE THEY CAN.

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:50.089
LIVE IN RESIDE SLEEP.

00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:52.725
FIND SHELTER FROM THE STORMS.

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:55.094
BUT TO PUT THEMSELVES IN AN

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.129
EMPLOYABLE CATEGORY SO THEY CAN

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:59.765
BE SELF SUFFICIENT. TO DIRECT

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.400
THEM TOWARDS REHABILITATIVE

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:03.502
OPPORTUNITIES WHICH MANY OF THEM

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:05.771
NEED ALCOHOL SUBSTANCE ABUSE FOR

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:07.172
EXAMPLE.

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:09.842
I DON'T SEE MUCH FOCUS ON THE

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:11.543
LONG TERM SOLUTION THERE'S NOT

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:12.711
JUST TRYING.

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:13.712
TO KEEP BUILDING AND BUILDING

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:15.147
AND BUILDING TO KEEP UP WITH THE

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:17.249
POPULATION OF INCREASING NUMBERS

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:19.885
OF HOMELESS BUT IT ALSO HAS TO

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:21.787
DELVE INTO.

00:15:21.854 --> 00:15:23.188
DEALING WITH THE ISSUES THAT

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:25.124
CAUSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO BE

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.860
HOMELESS AND HOPEFULLY GET MANY.

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:31.830
NOT. TO HAVETO BE IN THAT CLASS

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:34.667
OR CHOOSE TO BE IN THAT CLASS.

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:35.968
SO I WOULD MAKE TWO POINT YOU'RE

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.102
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT IT'S NOT

00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:39.071
SIMPLY ABOUT EXPANDING HOUSING

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:40.105
OPTIONS ALTHOUGH THAT IS A BIG

00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:41.740
PART OF IT AND SO I THINK THERE

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:43.475
ARE TWO THINGS THAT THIS.

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:44.977
TALE AND THE BROADER BUDGET TO

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.412
FIRST TO SPECIFICALLY IN THIS

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:47.246
BILL.

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:48.647
WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:50.883
RELEASED IN JANUARY IT PROPOSED

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:52.484
NOT SIMPLY SHELTERS BUT ALSO

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.920
NAVIGATION CENTERS AND A FOCUS

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:56.255
ON PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.023
ALL ACROSS THAT SPECTRUM?

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.525
AND WHAT WE'VE DONE SINCE THEN

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:01.293
WORKING WITH AND RECEIVING

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:01.894
FEEDBACK FROM MEMBERS OF THE

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.762
LEGISLATURE IS EXPANDING THE

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:05.331
NUMBER OF OPTIONS FOR WHICH THAT

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:06.932
MONEY CAN BE USED SO.

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:08.267
THAT WE'RE NOT CONTROLLING IT AT

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:09.635
THE STATE LEVEL LOCAL

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:10.703
JURISDICTIONS WHAT A LOT OF

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.604
FLEXIBILITY -- BUT THEY KNOW ON

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:14.039
THE GROUNDS CLOSEST TO THAT AND

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:15.507
WHERE THE NEEDS ARE AND HOW TO

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:16.942
MAKE SURE NOT ONLY THAT WE'RE

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:18.210
HELPING PEOPLE GET SHELTER BUT

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:19.745
THAT WE'RE MOVING AS MANY PEOPLE

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.113
AS WE CAN INTO PERMANENT

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.047
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND THEN

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:24.350
EVENTUALLY -- IN SOME CASES

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:25.250
WITHOUT NEEDING FURTHER STATE

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:26.618
SUPPORT SO THERE IS THAT

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:29.221
FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE SIX

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:29.955
HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS IN

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:31.490
THIS BILL AND THEN THE SECOND

00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:32.991
THING I'LL SAY AND NOT ALL THESE

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:34.560
ELEMENTS ARE WITHIN THE SPECIFIC

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.028
BILL BEFORE YOU -- BUT THE

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:37.830
ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET ALSO

00:16:37.896 --> 00:16:39.665
INCLUDES A WHOLE PERSON CARE

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:41.066
PILOTS AND A NUMBER OF IN A

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:42.601
RAPID RE HOUSING EFFORTS AT UC

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.470
AND CSU INFINITY COLLEGES

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:45.704
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE CAN GET

00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:46.705
HOUSING THERE THEY GET THEIR

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:47.840
DEGREE IT'S LESS LIKELY THAT

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:48.807
THEY WILL.

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:50.576
BE IN HOUSING EMERGENCIES SO I

00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:51.443
THINK YOU SEE A NUMBER OF

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.544
EFFORTS WITHIN THE BUDGET

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:54.213
INCLUDING ALSO RE ENTRY FOR

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.748
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANSITIONING OUT

00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:57.416
OF A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.

00:16:57.483 --> 00:16:57.950
THAT WE THINK ARE REALLY

00:16:58.016 --> 00:16:59.818
IMPORTANT TO ATTACK THIS ISSUE

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:05.357
FROM ALL ANGLES BUT WILL THERE

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:06.725
BE ANY LEVEL.

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:07.960
OF ASSESSMENT FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:08.827
NAVIGATION CENTERS HAVE AN

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:09.561
ATTRACTION.

00:17:09.628 --> 00:17:10.362
THAT TO ME.

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:12.097
BUT AT THAT NAVIGATION CENTER

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:13.899
WHICH IS A CENTRAL PLACE.

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:15.968
WOULD THERE BE ANY ASSESSMENT

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:17.603
CAPABILITY AT THAT CENTER WITH

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:18.637
LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE THE

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.205
OPPORTUNITY THE RESOURCES THE

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:23.175
MEANS THE POWER BUT TO ASSESS

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:25.210
THE NEEDS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL.

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:26.445
NOT JUST IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:27.980
WOULD RESIDE.

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:29.882
BUT HOW THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:31.483
PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.951
AND FIND RESOURCES FOR THE

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:34.586
CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE WILL

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:36.455
THERE BE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES IN

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:37.723
THE NAVIGATION CENTERS.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.691
I BELIEVE SO BECAUSE WE ARE NOT

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:41.293
PRESCRIBING THE FUNDING TO THAT

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.562
LEVEL OF DETAIL IN STATUTE IN

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:44.863
THIS BILL SO I BELIEVE THAT

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.165
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WILL HAVE A

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:47.900
LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN MAKING

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:49.568
THOSE TYPES OF DETERMINATIONS.

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:51.170
WELL IT'S A LITTLE LATE IN THE

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:53.205
GAME BUT I WOULD SUGGEST

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:55.040
VERBIAGE IN THE BILL.

00:17:55.107 --> 00:17:56.008
THAT MONEY SHOULD.

00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:57.643
OR ENCOURAGING LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:59.044
TO FOCUS ON THAT WOULD BE

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:01.914
HELPFUL.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.582
THIS CALL TO YOUR FOLLOWED BY

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:04.817
MISS SKINNER.

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:07.019
VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR -- I JUST

00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:10.189
WANTED -- TO TO THANK YOU FOR

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:11.957
THE THE STRUCTURE FOR THAT --

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:14.526
THAT HOUSING ELEMENT COMPLIANCE.

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:16.929
AND COURT REMEDIES -- INITIALLY

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:18.530
THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:21.533
A MUCH MORE ONEROUS PENALTY AT

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.168
THE END WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:24.603
STATE TO COME IN AND TAKE OVER

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:25.404
AND I THINK THAT.

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.272
CREATED SOME ANXIETY FOR MANY OF

00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:28.040
US WHO COME FROM LOCAL

00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:29.842
GOVERNMENT -- EVEN IF IT WAS

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:31.877
NEVER UTILIZE THE FACT THAT IT'S

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.479
THERE BECOMES A I I THINK A

00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:35.013
CHALLENGE SINCE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.215
IN THE STATE ALL REPRESENT THE

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:37.783
SAME PEOPLE SO I I AM I

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.251
APPRECIATE THAT THAT.

00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:41.086
THE STRUCTURE I ALSO APPRECIATE

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:44.089
THE ESCALATING NATURE OF THE

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:48.160
COMPLIANCE -- PENALTIES BECAUSE

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:49.361
WERE REALLY.

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:50.863
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:51.997
STEP.

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.665
IN PLANNING FOR HOUSING WE'RE

00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:54.566
NOT TALKING ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.235
PRODUCING IT OR NOT THIS IS

00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:58.070
REALLY THEFIRST STEP WHICH IS

00:18:58.136 --> 00:18:59.238
THE PLANNING STEP AND SO.

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:00.706
ON REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT AND

00:19:00.772 --> 00:19:02.574
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I I

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:03.842
COMMUNICATED THAT THERE ARE MANY

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:05.611
OF US THAT ARE THAT ARE -- MUCH

00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:07.112
HAPPIER WITH THE WAY THAT IT'S

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:08.580
BEEN STRUCTURED THIS POINT I

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:09.715
SHOULD CLARIFY AN INTEREST OF

00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:11.383
FULL TANSPARENCY THERE IS AS A

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.918
LAST RESORT AT THE END OF THIS

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:13.418
BILL.

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:15.153
THE COURT WITHIN ITS DISCRETION

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.555
COULD APPOINT AN AGENT OF THE

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:17.589
COURT.

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:18.657
TO HELP BRING THE JURISDICTION

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:20.158
COMPLIANCE BUT AS YOU NOTED IT

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:22.594
IS ONLY AFTER A SERIES OF STEPS --

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:23.962
WHERE EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.963
ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITH OTHER

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.232
REMEDIES WELL AND IT'S ALSO IT'S

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:28.901
A IT'S A COURT?

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:31.069
IT'S A COURT INITIATED PROCESS

00:19:31.136 --> 00:19:33.138
CORRECT YES AND ED ED.

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:34.973
APPOINTED BY THE COURT -- AND SO

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.642
THAT THE I THINK IS IS FOR

00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:38.443
FURTHER REMOVES THE STATE FROM

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.347
THAT WHOLE.

00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:43.849
THAT WHOLE FRAMEWORK

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:44.149
[inaudible]

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:47.586
THE SCANNER.

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:49.388
THANK YOU I MADAM CHAIR -- I

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:49.988
THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.023
THERE'S MOST ELEMENTS TIME VERY

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:52.724
VERY HAPPY WITH.

00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:55.460
THERE IS ONE CONCERN THAT I HAVE

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.229
IN IN THE HOMELESSNESS SECTION.

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:59.932
WHERE WE PROVIDE THE FUNDING TO

00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:01.400
THE CITIES?

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:03.302
AND THEN TO THE COUNTY AND TO

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:04.870
THE CONTINUUM OF CARE.

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:08.473
THE LANGUAGE IN -- THE SECTION

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:15.147
STARTING WITH -- STARTING WITH

00:20:15.213 --> 00:20:16.782
PAGE.

00:20:16.848 --> 00:20:18.650
FORTY FOUR LINES TWENTY FOUR ON

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:24.423
IT ADDRESSES -- BEING ABLE.

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:25.857
TO DEAL WITH IMMEDIATE HOMELESS

00:20:25.924 --> 00:20:27.526
CHALLENGES.

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:29.194
BUT THEN THE LANGUAGE IN THOSE

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:32.164
LINES TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.698
TWENTY SEVEN IS EXPLICIT.

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:36.535
OF IT'S VERY SAD NERO THAT IT

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:38.303
NEEDS. TO MOVE HOMELESS

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.972
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES INTO

00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:42.007
PERMANENT HOUSING AND SUPPORTING

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.809
THE F. EFFORTS OF THOSE

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:45.677
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES MEANING

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:47.145
THE HOMELESS FAMILIES.

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:51.083
SO THEN YOU GO ON TO PAGE.

00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:55.220
FORTY SIX AND IN OUR LINE

00:20:55.287 --> 00:20:55.787
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IT

00:20:55.854 --> 00:20:57.556
REFERENCES THAT THE FUNDS CAN BE

00:20:57.623 --> 00:20:59.524
USED FOR PREVENTION SO THAT

00:20:59.591 --> 00:20:59.858
WOULD.

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:02.227
INDICATE SOMEONE WHO IS NOT YET

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:03.362
HOMELESS.

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:08.667
BUT THEN I GOES DOWN TO LINES

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:09.301
TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:09.868
NINE THIRTY WHICH SEEMED TO

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:10.569
REFERENCE.

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:13.672
FEDERAL DEFINITIONS WHICH ARE

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:15.707
VERY NARROWLY CONSTRUED TO BE

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:16.942
ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:20.012
HOMELESS OR WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS

00:21:20.078 --> 00:21:21.647
OF BECOMING HOMELESS.

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:25.417
SO THEN IF WE GO TO PAGE FORTY

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:26.985
SEVEN IT INDICATES THAT WE CAN

00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:29.554
USE THE FUNDS. TO ADDRESS AND

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:32.290
PREVENT HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:33.759
RENTAL ASSISTANCE.

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:36.094
MY CONCERN IS THAT BY THE NARROW

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:37.429
DEFINITION.

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:39.731
OF THAT YOU HAVE TO BE WITHIN

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.033
FOURTEEN DAYS OF BEING HOMELESS

00:21:41.099 --> 00:21:43.201
THAT IT WOULD.

00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:45.070
RESTRICT THE THE SEEM TO BE

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:46.505
CONTRADICTORY.

00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:49.808
AND IT WOULD ONLY ALLOW.

00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:51.610
A NEW ENTITY WHO IS APPLYING FOR

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:54.579
THESE FUNDS WHO WANTS.

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.581
TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO PREVENT A

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:58.984
FAMILY FROM BECOMING HOMELESS.

00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:00.285
TO ONLY PROVIDE THEM THAT

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:02.754
SUPPORT IF THEY'RE WITHIN

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:04.022
FOURTEEN DAYS.

00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:06.058
OF BECOMING HOMELESS.

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:09.661
MOST FOLKS WHO ARE FACED WITH.

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:11.029
EITHER THE POTENTIAL FOR

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:13.298
ADDICTION OR EVEN EVICTION NO IT

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:14.866
BEFORE FOURTEEN DAYS.

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:17.703
AND A WINDOW OF FOURTEEN DAYS IS

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:20.338
A VERY SHORT WINDOW TO REALLY.

00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:21.473
ASSIST.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.108
AND PREVENT THEM FROM LOSING

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:24.609
THEIR HOME.

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:28.213
SO I I ASKED MY STAFF TO TAKE

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.549
THE BILL TO LEDGE COUNCIL TO SEE.

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:32.951
IF MY INTERPRETATION BECAUSE I

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.653
DIDN'T WANT IT AND LEDGE COUNCIL

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.455
SAYS YES IT SEEMS TO BE

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:38.590
CONTRADICTORY OR THEY MAY NOT

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:40.125
USE THAT LANGUAGE.

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.060
BUT RATHER THAT -- THAT CLEAR

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:44.129
FINDING LANGUAGE MIGHT BE

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:44.563
HELPFUL.

00:22:44.629 --> 00:22:46.498
AND I REALIZED THAT WE WANT TO

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:49.167
PASS TODAY I'M HOPING THAT WE

00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:50.969
CAN DO SOME CLEAN UP LANGUAGE

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:52.771
BECAUSE WHEN I READ THE BILL IT

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:55.574
SEEMS VERY CLEAR IN ITS INTENT.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.042
THAT WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE

00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:59.244
FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO USE

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:01.513
THE FINDING IF THEY SO CHOOSE TO

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.014
HELP PREVENT PEOPLE FROM

00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:04.616
BECOMING HOMELESS.

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:06.585
AND WE MAY NEED WHAT WHAT I

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:08.720
ASKED LEDGE COUNCIL IS WHAT IS

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:10.989
THE SIMPLEST AMENDMENT.

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:13.492
THAT COULD MAKE SURE THAT THESE

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:14.693
ARE NOT AT ODDS.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.628
AND I WANT TO RAISE THIS BECAUSE

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:18.930
NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE.

00:23:18.997 --> 00:23:20.265
WE HAVE THIS CLEAR INTENT I

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:21.066
DON'T WANT IT TO BE

00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:23.869
CONTRADICTORY BUT EDITION ONLY

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:25.036
IF WE LOOK AT THE DATA. FOR THE

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:27.672
RISE IN HOMELESSNESS IN THE LAST

00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:28.707
FIVE YEARS.

00:23:28.774 --> 00:23:32.277
AND WE'VE SEEN THESE JUNKS. 17%

00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:34.212
OVER A PERIOD OF A YEAR JUST

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:35.847
BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:37.783
IN MANY OF OUR JURISDICTIONS

00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:38.083
[inaudible]

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.018
THOSE PEOPLE.

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.987
THE DATA SHOWS.

00:23:42.053 --> 00:23:44.289
ARE NOT MENTALLY ILL.

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:47.492
ARE NOT ADDICTED ADDICTED.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.461
MANY HAVE FAMILIES.

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:52.097
ALL WERE HOUSED NEVER ON HOUSE

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:53.665
PRIOR.

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:55.033
ALL HAVE JOBS.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.535
SO THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE THAT

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:59.738
FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY OF

00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:00.705
FACING.

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:02.908
THAT UNEXPECTED EXPENSE WHICH

00:24:02.974 --> 00:24:04.376
THEN LED THEM TO GET BEHIND ON

00:24:04.442 --> 00:24:05.877
RENT POTENTIALLY AND NOW I'M

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:07.779
SPECULATING BUT THEY FACED AN

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:10.649
UNEXPECTED EXPENSE. FOR THEY

00:24:10.715 --> 00:24:12.584
FOUND THEMSELVES WERE THERE

00:24:12.651 --> 00:24:14.085
WHERE THEY WERE LIVING.

00:24:14.152 --> 00:24:15.687
MAYBE THE PERSON WHOSE NAME WAS

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:17.489
ON THE LEASE LAUGHTER HAD TO

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:18.890
MOVE IN THEIR NAME WASN'T ON THE

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:19.958
LEASE AND SO THEN THEY DIDN'T

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:21.993
HAVE PROTECTIONS OR ANY NUMBER

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.495
OF OTHER THINGS.

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:26.331
THAT IF WE CAN INTERVENE.

00:24:26.398 --> 00:24:27.799
BEFORE.

00:24:27.866 --> 00:24:31.303
THERE ON THE STREET IS FAR FAR.

00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:34.539
LESS RESOURCES TO KEEP THE HOUSE

00:24:34.606 --> 00:24:36.308
AND WE KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:38.310
MAYOR'S THE FOURTEEN MAYORS OF

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:39.444
THIRTEEN MAYORS ALL WROTE US A

00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:41.146
LETTER SAYING THAT THEY WANTED.

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:42.814
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WOULD

00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:44.382
HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE THIS

00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:45.750
FOR EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:48.286
SO I'M BEING VERY CLEAR ABOUT IT

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.884
AREA THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME.

00:28:39.951 --> 00:28:43.455
IS THE THERE IS A SCANNER CENTER

00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:45.090
SCANNER WAS TALKING ABOUT AND

00:28:45.156 --> 00:28:47.592

YET ON THIS BILL OKAY.

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:58.603
I I I DON'T SEE MUCH EMPHASIS IN

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.705
THIS BILL ON THAT CATEGORY

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:01.773
THAT'S THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.944
PER. 13250% -- THAT IT'S BEEN

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.779

MILLION UNITS SHORTAGE.

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:17.388
AND THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT

00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:19.657
ARE FALLING INTO HOME WAS IN

00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:21.059
FACT SACRAMENTAL RIGHT HERE.

00:29:21.126 --> 00:29:23.261
LAST YEAR JUST NEAR YOUR ONE

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:26.131
YEAR THE YEAR WAS 19% INCREASE.

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:26.931
AND WE'RE GETTING SIMILAR

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:30.902
NUMBERS IN LOS ANGELES SAN JOSE

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:31.903
SAN FRANCISCO ALL THE

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:32.904
COMMUNITIES ARE HAVING THESE --

00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:34.506
INCREASES.

00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:36.141
IN THE HOMELESS AND IT'S THE

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:38.710
PEOPLE IN THIS CATEGORY.

THAT ARE FALLING INTO HOMELESS

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:46.484
AND THE QUESTION AS OF DO YOU

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:48.520
AGREE THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW UP

00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:49.854
WITH THIS BILL.

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:51.389
IN STUDYING WHAT WE COULD DO

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:54.025
WITH THAT CATEGORY WE NEED TO WE

00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:54.225
NEED.

00:29:54.292 --> 00:29:55.793
TO FOLLOW UP.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.929
AND DEAL WITH THAT PARTICULAR

00:29:57.996 --> 00:30:01.699
AREA OR ELSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE --

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:05.103
MMHM WAY MORE HOMELESS SO PEOPLE.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.772
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.307
WE'RE GONNA KEEP FALLING BEHIND.

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:11.342
OF IT EVERY YEAR IN TERMS OF

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:13.411
TOTAL NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE

00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:16.915
THAT WE HAVE IN IN CALIFORNIA.

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:19.751
AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I THINK

00:30:19.817 --> 00:30:20.885
WE'RE DEALING WITH THE HOME WAS

00:30:20.952 --> 00:30:22.420
THAT WE HAVE NOW GOOD BUT WHAT I

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:25.256
THINK WE'RE NOT RECOGNIZING THAT

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:26.624
WE'RE HAVING A TREND HERE.

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:28.993
THAT'S REALLY A BAD TREND IT'S

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.895
IT'S DANGEROUSLY BAD.

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:33.231
OF AND PART OF IT'S BECAUSE BY

00:30:33.298 --> 00:30:36.000
THINGS LIKE THE THE CANCELLATION

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:38.269
OF THE DEED RESTRICTIONS THAT.

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:39.938
FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:40.805
UNITS.

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:42.507
HAVE.

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:44.642
IN TERMS OF THE DEED

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.511
RESTRICTIONS THE THAT WERE

00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:48.780
PLACED ON THE GENEROUS LIKE.

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:49.847
THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS AGO

00:30:49.914 --> 00:30:52.317
THAT ARE NOW EXPIRING.

00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:54.419
AND SO NOW THESE UNITS ARE BEING

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:56.187
PRICED AT A MARKET RATE THE

00:30:56.254 --> 00:31:01.626
RENTS ARE RIGHT RISEN -- THE THE

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:04.762
THE INCREASE WITH THE FAILURE OF

00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:05.997
OF ANY KIND OF RENT CONTROL OR

00:31:06.064 --> 00:31:09.234
IN WRITTEN RENT ISSUES.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.468
HAS REALLY CAUSED.

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:12.470
A LARGE NUMBER OF RANTS TO GO UP

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:15.106
WHICH PUTS PUSHES PEOPLE OUT OF

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:16.441
THEIR UNITS.

00:31:16.507 --> 00:31:18.509
QUITE FRANKLY -- THAT'S THE

00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:21.412
CONSEQUENCE -- WE KNOW THIS IS

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:22.513
HAPPENING.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.915
AND WE'RE SEEING THE NUMBERS THE

00:31:23.982 --> 00:31:25.750
ALMOST COUNTS ARE JUST GOING UP

00:31:25.817 --> 00:31:26.851
SPEC YOU KNOW JUST.

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:28.920
IN A IN A IN A CRISIS MODE

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:34.092
MANNER -- BUT IN THE BUDGET HERE.

00:31:34.158 --> 00:31:35.293
THIS TRAILER BILL DOESN'T

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.562
RECOGNIZE.

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:39.330
OF THAT PARTICULAR FOR THAT

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.565
PARTICULAR.

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:43.368
CATEGORY I HONESTLY IT DOESN'T.

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:44.902
I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A

00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:46.104
TRUE STANDPOINT IT REALLY

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.406
DOESN'T SO CAN YOU CAN YOU OUT.

00:31:48.473 --> 00:31:49.907
IF YOU COULD COMMENT ABOUT WHAT

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:52.176
WE HAVE TO DO NEXT.

00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:53.077
YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO ADOPT

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.579
THIS THIS IS KIND OF A HALF HALF

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:55.680
THE GAME.

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:56.881
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:58.449
THIS [inaudible]

00:31:58.516 --> 00:32:01.619
CRISIS CATEGORY THAT WE HAVE CAN

THE FUTURE. TO ADDRESS THESE

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:17.001
THIS CRITICAL CRISIS THAT WE

00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:18.636
HAVE.

00:32:18.703 --> 00:32:20.271
YES TELL MAKE TWO POINTS THANK

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:21.606
YOU FOR THAT I THINK THE FIRST

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:23.408
IS THAT YOU ARE RIGHT THAT A

00:32:23.474 --> 00:32:24.909
NUMBER OF THESE PROGRAMS --

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:26.444
FOLLOW A BROADER MORE MIXED

00:32:26.511 --> 00:32:28.346
INCOME YOU KNOW UP TO A 120%

00:32:28.413 --> 00:32:31.215
AREA MEDIAN INCOME -- PERCENTAGE --

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:32.684
AND WHEN IT COMES SPECIFICALLY

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.719
THOUGH TO THE FOCUSED -- THAT

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:36.621
YOU MENTIONED WE DO BELIEVE THAT

00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:38.656
A PART OF OUR EXPANSION OF THE

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:39.924
LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT --

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:41.159
MAKES A DIFFERENCE THERE AND I

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:42.593
WILL SAY ABOUT THAT PART OF THE

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.429
PACKAGE WHERE AS MOST OF THE

00:32:44.495 --> 00:32:46.230
OTHER ITEMS WITH REGARD TO

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:47.231
SPENDING IN THIS BILL ARE ONE

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:47.899
TIME.

00:32:47.965 --> 00:32:49.667
THAT IS AN ON GOING OUT LOCATION

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:50.902
DATA FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:32:50.968 --> 00:32:52.270
DOLLARS WHICH IS SPLIT BUT PART

00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:53.371
OF THAT REALLY IS FOCUSED ON

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:55.373
EXPANDING THAT 4% TAX CREDIT AND

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.841
MAKING SURE IT GETS. TO THOSE

00:32:56.908 --> 00:32:58.576
FAMILIES BUT ON THE BROADER

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:00.078
POINT AT YOU ARE CORRECT THAT.

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:01.412
THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T BELIEVE

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:02.146
THAT THIS ONE BILL BY ITSELF

00:33:02.213 --> 00:33:03.881
WILL SOLVE THE ISSUE AND HE

00:33:03.948 --> 00:33:05.316
KNOWS THAT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE

00:33:05.383 --> 00:33:07.251
TO DO SO HE NEED MINISTRATION

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:08.553
ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING LATER IN

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:10.021
THE SESSION OVER THE UPCOMING

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:11.823
YEAR. TO CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:12.690
MORE WE CAN DO IN THIS AREA

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:14.325
THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT THIS

00:33:14.392 --> 00:33:15.993
CATEGORY THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:16.894
ABOUT.

00:33:16.961 --> 00:33:21.699
IS THE SOFT SPOT IN THIS.

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:22.967
TRADE HOUSING TRAILER BILL.

00:33:23.034 --> 00:33:24.068
IT'S A SOFT SPOT YOU'RE YOU'RE

00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:24.669
YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:26.804
TAX CREDITS I THINK IT WAS. TWO

00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.606
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:30.808
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION CORRECT.

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:31.442
WELL THAT'S THAT'S NICE BUT IT'S

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:32.710
NOT.

00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:33.845
IT'S NOT GOING TO PLUG THE DIET

00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:37.014
OF THE RISE IN HOMELESSNESS SETS.

00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:39.617
NICE BUT IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO

00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:40.852
SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:41.919
THEY CERTAINLY MORE TO DO

00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:44.856
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

00:33:44.922 --> 00:33:46.157
I THINK THERE'S A PACKAGE OF

00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:47.825
BILLS GOING TO THE ROCESS ALSO

00:33:47.892 --> 00:33:49.560

CONTROL.

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:00.438
BILLS THAT DIED.

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:02.407
ARE GOING TO HAVE A VERY BAD

00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:04.208
EFFECT OVER THE NEXT YEAR.

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:06.344

DIRECTLY AS YOU MENTIONED IT WAS

00:36:31.722 --> 00:36:33.558
