ECONOMY VERY SLOWLY WE OPEN

00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:02.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE LEARNING

00:57:02.318 --> 00:57:04.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THE OPENING MIGHT ACTUALLY

00:57:04.387 --> 00:57:06.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BE A LOT MORE CHALLENGING THAN.

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:09.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE ORIGINAL LOCKED DOWN- AND I

00:57:09.492 --> 00:57:10.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

RESPOND TO A MAJOR ECONOMIC

00:57:25.408 --> 00:57:27.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:29.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT MAJOR

NUMBER ONE CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:20.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:24.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ENFORCEABLE OPEN GUIDELINES DAD.

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:26.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO PROTECT WORKERS AND HOUSE.

00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:28.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND GENERALLY WHEN WE COME TO

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:30.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE LEGISLATURE WE ASK FOR

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

STATE PACKED- IT'S IMPORTANT-

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:51.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THE STATE

01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:52.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACTED QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY NO

OF THE WESTERN PACKED YEAH AND

I THINK ONE THING THAT'S CLEAR

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:13.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:14.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

THE STORE WHICH I THINK WAS

MORE SO FORWARD. OR ARE WE

02:09:46.178 --> 02:09:47.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOING TO SEE FOLKS WANTING TO

EVEN BEFORE THAT CAN'T GET A

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:56.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CAT. AND AGAIN I THINK THAT.

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:46.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ALL DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:47.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUSINESS. I SO I THINK FOR ME I

02:10:47.873 --> 02:10:49.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TALK REALLY WATCH THE IMPACT

02:10:49.841 --> 02:10:52.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SMALLER RETAIL. AND HOPING THAT

02:10:52.744 --> 02:10:53.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY CAN MAKE IT THROUGH YOU

02:10:53.745 --> 02:10:55.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAY SEE THEM. VERY MAYBE A BIT

02:10:55.614 --> 02:10:57.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BETTER BECAUSE I THINK THERE

02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:58.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ARE FOLKS IN THEIR LOCAL

02:10:58.817 --> 02:11:00.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY WANT TO

02:11:00.285 --> 02:11:01.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
GO WAITED OUTLOOK LOCAL

02:11:01.553 --> 02:11:03.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BOOKSTORE. LOCAL GET SHOT

02:11:04.056 --> 02:11:05.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT PERSONAL

02:11:05.324 --> 02:11:06.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONNECTION AND THEY WANTED TO

02:11:06.825 --> 02:11:09.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BE THERE LOCAL START FEEDING.

02:11:09.661 --> 02:11:10.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND BUT I THINK IT WILL BE

02:11:10.896 --> 02:11:12.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INTERESTING I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:11:12.998 --> 02:11:14.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE WILL KNOW THE FULL IMPACT.

02:11:14.666 --> 02:11:16.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR ANOTHER. YOU KNOW A COUPLE

02:11:16.635 --> 02:11:18.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF WEEKS AND TODAY AS A MATTER

02:11:19.037 --> 02:11:21.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF FACT IN. CALCULATOR WEEKEND

02:11:21.873 --> 02:11:23.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ONE OF THE LARGEST SHOPPING

02:11:23.508 --> 02:11:26.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MALLS WITH OPENING. AND SO I'M

02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:32.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THAT WORK.

02:11:32.084 --> 02:11:32.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HE SAN DIEGO OPENING THE LAR

02:11:32.985 --> 02:11:35.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MARKET THEIR OPENING FOR. YOU

02:11:35.587 --> 02:11:37.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW DO PEOPLE SHOW UP DO NINE

02:11:37.889 --> 02:11:39.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO I THINK IT'S A LITTLE EARLY

02:11:39.591 --> 02:11:43.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO BE- BUT THAT IMPACT IS BUT

02:11:43.328 --> 02:11:45.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. IF

02:11:45.564 --> 02:11:45.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THERE'S ONE THING THAT I

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:48.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ENCOURAGE PARTICULARLY SMALLER

02:11:48.133 --> 02:11:49.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUSINESSES IS THAT THEY DO HAVE

02:11:49.935 --> 02:11:52.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO RETAKE GOING FORWARD THEIR

02:11:52.804 --> 02:11:53.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEIR BUSINESS PLAN IN TERMS

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:56.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT. ONLINE PRESENCE YOU KNOW

02:11:56.174 --> 02:11:57.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IF WE DO HAVE A SECOND WAVE

02:11:57.976 --> 02:11:59.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ENSURING THAT THEY CAN DO

02:11:59.144 --> 02:12:02.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CURBSIDE IF THEY CAN STILL NEW

02:12:02.547 --> 02:12:04.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND GOODS TO THEIR STORES.

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:06.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REALLY INCREASING YOUR ONLINE

02:12:06.485 --> 02:12:09.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRESENCE AND HOPE THAT WE CAN.

02:12:10.022 --> 02:12:12.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IF WE DO GET IN ANOTHER

02:12:12.958 --> 02:12:13.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SITUATION LIKE THAT. RETAILERS

02:12:13.892 --> 02:12:15.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
CAN STILL BE SOMEWHAT

02:12:15.327 --> 02:12:17.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMPETITIVE AND I WOULD HOPE

02:12:17.829 --> 02:12:19.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT A BROADER.

02:12:19.364 --> 02:12:21.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

02:12:21.099 --> 02:12:22.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

INTO THIS ESSENTIAL

02:12:23.769 --> 02:12:25.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

LIMITED OPERATIONS FOR THE LAST

02:19:14.379 --> 02:19:16.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MONTH OR TWO I CAN TELL YOU

02:19:16.214 --> 02:19:17.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THAT THESE THINGS AND

02:19:17.282 --> 02:19:18.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ESPECIALLY AS COUNTIES ARE RE

02:19:18.717 --> 02:19:20.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OPENING NOW. THESE ARE THE

02:19:20.952 --> 02:19:22.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINGS THAT CONSUMERS WANT TO.

02:19:22.687 --> 02:19:24.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND WHEN THEY WALK INTO A

AT THIS. CRISIS AND WE BAD DID

02:25:48.139 --> 02:25:49.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT I AND I HOPE THAT THAT

02:25:49.707 --> 02:25:51.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POLICY MAKERS LOOK BACK. ONCE

02:25:51.476 --> 02:25:52.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

NINETEEN. FIFTY WILL WORK AND

02:25:56.647 --> 02:25:59.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT NEEDED TO BE ADAPTED. TO

02:25:59.183 --> 02:26:00.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE DEPEND PROTECTION ACT I'M

02:26:00.952 --> 02:26:01.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SEASON PRODUCTION ACT OF

02:26:01.919 --> 02:26:04.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COURSE. IS A DRASTIC STEP. IT

02:26:04.388 --> 02:26:07.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COMMANDEERS A FACILITY AND

02:26:07.592 --> 02:26:08.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REQUIRES PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:09.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MATERIALS. ON THE CHALLENGE

02:26:09.727 --> 02:26:10.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH THAT IS MAKING SURE THAT

02:26:10.962 --> 02:26:12.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THERE S A SUPPLY CHAIN THAT

02:26:12.563 --> 02:26:14.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CAN BACK THAT UP. AND THAT IS

02:26:14.565 --> 02:26:15.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NOT ALWAYS THE CASE IN SOME

02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:17.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TIMES AS WE TALKED BEFORE THAT

02:26:17.902 --> 02:26:19.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GLOBAL- THAT SUPPLY CHAIN IS

02:26:20.004 --> 02:26:21.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AVAILABLE ONLY GLOBAL. IN

02:26:21.639 --> 02:26:22.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

UNITED STATES FOR PRODUCTION I

02:26:24.475 --> 02:26:25.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAME JOB ONE WHICH IS WHY I

02:26:25.843 --> 02:26:27.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MENTION THE PORT ACTIVITY. ON

02:26:29.247 --> 02:26:31.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CRITICALLY A VITALLY IMPORTANT-

02:26:31.282 --> 02:26:33.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK WHAT COULD DO THAT WE

02:26:33.551 --> 02:26:35.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COULD HAVE BEEN DONE. BUT THE

02:26:35.686 --> 02:26:36.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

THE INDUSTRY SECTOR THAT-

02:26:45.696 --> 02:26:46.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PRODUCES THOSE TEMP TO MAKE

02:26:46.764 --> 02:26:48.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BECAUSE I. AM A NINETY FIVE
