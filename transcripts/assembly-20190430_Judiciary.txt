FROM FICTION AND FANTASY. ALTHOUGH THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD HAVE BROAD IMPLICATIONS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY ELECTION OUTCOMES AND DIPLOMACY IT IS PREDOMINANTLY BEING USED TO HARASS AND HUMILIATE WOMEN. BY SCRAPING THEIR PHOTOS FROM THE INTERNET AND MANIPULATING THEM INTO SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL. BEYOND NATURAL FEELINGS OF EMBARRASSMENT FALSELY APPEARING IN A DEEP FAKE PORN VIDEO CAN CAUSE IRREPARABLE HARM TO A VICTIM'S REPUTATION. JOB PROSPECTS PERSONAL REAL RELATIONSHIPS AND MENTAL HEALTH.

COMPETITION ACTED THE OFFICE RECEIVES ALL OF THE CIVIL PENALTIES AWARDED BY THE COURT. HOWEVER WHEN THE CITY ATTORNEY BRING SUCH ACTION THE CIVIL PENALTIES MUST BE SPLIT EVENLY WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THAT COUNTY. THIS DISCREPANCY HAS LEFT THOSE ELIGIBLE CITY ATTORNEY'S WITH A DIFFICULT CHOICE. COUNTING THE PURSUIT OF LEGAL RECOURSE AGAINST UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS WITH THE REALITY OF FINITE PUBLIC RESOURCES. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN REQUIRES PENALTIES COLLECTED BY THE ELIGIBLE CITY ATTORNEY FROM AN ACTION UNDER THE FAIR UNFAIR COMPETITION ACT TO BE PAID ENTIRELY TO THE CITY.

TWO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD WE NEED AS MANY PROTECTIONS OF OUR TENANTS AS WE CAN. THE ONE THING I JUST WANNA MENTION AS AS YOU KNOW IS -- I HAVE A SEPARATE BILL -- THAT IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL GETTING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WOULD ESTABLISH AN ANTI RENT GOUGING CAP AT THIS POINT -- THE BILL WOULD CAP RENT INCREASES AT CPI PLUS 5%. MY HOPE IS THAT -- ASSUMING BOTH OF THESE GET THROUGH THE PROCESS WE CAN RATIONALIZE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE TRIGGERS -- WORK BUT WITH THAT I THINK THE CONCEPT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO MAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF SENSE AND I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THE MOTION TO MOVE IT FOR THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M EIGHTY SIX SEVENTY AND FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AND MISTER -- THE CHAIRMAN WORKING WITH US ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THERE ARE OVER FIFTY TWO THOUSAND COMMUNITY INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE STATE THAT MAKE UP APPROXIMATELY SIX MILLION TOTAL HOUSING UNITS APPROXIMATELY A QUARTER OF THE STATE'S HOUSING STOCK. RESIDENTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DENIED THE ABILITY TO BUILD AN EIGHTY YOU -- WHICH WE ALL AGREE IS A BIG PART OF THE STATE'S SOLUTION TOWARDS OUR HOUSING CRISIS -- BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE AWAY REGULATIONS THAT OVER THAT TRUMP ON THE STATE'S RULES SOMEHOW WHICH I BELIEVE IS NOT INTENDED IN THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION AND PROBABLY NOT KNOWN. I'M. SO AB SIX SEVENTY ALLOWS WERE APPROPRIATE THOSE HOHNER HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A SECOND UNIT IT APPLIES TO ALL EXISTING GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS AND ALLOWS REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS PROVIDED THAT THOSE RESTRICTIONS DO NOT EFFECTIVELY PROHIBIT. THE USE OF THE SECOND UNIT OR A JUNIOR -- EIGHTY YOU THIS IS A TARGETED APPROACH OF COURSE THAT FOCUSES ON SINGLE FAMILY DEVELOPMENT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ASSOCIATION MANAGERS ON THE SOLUTION -- IN LIGHT OF THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS THE EIGHTY USE ARE A VERY IMPORTANT SOLUTION AND WE CAN'T ALLOW ONE SMALL GROUP -- TO PROHIBIT THEIR PROPERTY OWNERS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THIS IMPORTANT -- A SOLUTION ARMED WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS DAVID JONES REPRESENTING THE TOWN OF TRUCKEE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FIRST WITH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DAVID JONES ABOUT THE TOWN PRESS -- WE DO THINK THAT THE STRIKES A VERY REASONABLE BALANCE SIMILAR TO BILLS THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S PASSED ALLOWING -- HOMEOWNERS IN H. A WAYS TO HAVE SOLAR A WATER EFFICIENCY SO WE THINK THAT THE LEGAL PRECEDENT IS GOOD -- WE WOULD RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF AN H. AWAY -- TO MAINTAIN ALL THOSE -- COVENANTS THAT WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH HAVING AN EIGHTY OLDER. UNIT THEN THE THE RESIDENTS WOULD BE RESTRICTED FOR FIFTY FIVE AN OLDER SO WE WE WANT TO MAINTAIN THE CHARACTER IF IT'S A SPANISH STYLE ARCHITECTURAL EIGHTY YOU I MEAN H. AWAY WE WOULD HAVE A SPANISH STYLE DESIGNS WE TRY TRY TO STRIKE THE BALANCE. OF RESPECTING -- THE TENANTS RIGHTS THE H. AWAY RIGHTS AND THEN ALLOWING THOSE -- THAT DESIRE TO HAVE ANY EIGHTY YOU TO BE ABLE HAVE THEM TRUCKEE IS UNIQUE WE'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE MILES OF NATIONAL FOREST AROUND US WE HAVE AN ACUTE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR WORKFORCE HOUSING -- WE HAVE A MASSIVE H. AWAY THAT IS DENIED -- EIGHT EIGHTY USE IN THAT THAT -- THAT PLACE THAT -- REST THOSE RESIDENTS -- WE HAVE.

KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN AYE OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE NO PETRIE-NORRIS. NORRIS I RACE. RACE AYE. THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU HI MISTER BLOOM. SIX IS THAT A NUMBER TEN AB. THIRTEEN NINETY NINE SEC THANK YOU RYAN ADDRESSED -- BUT MOST MORNING THE SECOND AIR AND MEMBERS THE THIS BILL WILL MAKE CLARIFYING CHANGES TO THE ELLIS ACT THAT ARE INTENDED TO BOTH ENSURE FAIRNESS FOR TENANTS. AND REMOVE AMBIGUITY FOR BOTH LANDLORDS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE ELLIS ACT WAS INTENDED AS A MEANS FOR LANDLORDS TO EXIT THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS NOT AS AN END RUN AROUND LOCAL PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY SOME LANDLORDS ARE USING A LOT TO DO THAT. OF THESE LANDLORDS ARE EVICTING TENANTS UNDER THE GUISE OF EXITING THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS BUT WITH NO INTENT OF ACTUALLY LEAVING THE MARKET INSTEAD. THEIR GAMING THE SYSTEM TO AVOID LOCAL PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS. SO TO ADDRESS THESE ABUSES THIS LEGISLATION WILL CLARIFY THE ELSE ACT IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. FIRST IT WILL REAFFIRM THE LAWS ORIGINAL INTENT THAT THERE CAN. BE ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHEN TIME LINES UNDER THE ACT BEGIN TO RUN. SECOND IT WILL CLARIFY THAT ONCE ANY UNIT IN A BUILDING IS RETURNED TO THE RENTAL MARKET THE ENTIRE PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED BACK ON THE RENTAL MARKET FOR PURPOSES OF THE ACT. AND FINALLY THE BILL MAKES CLEAR THAT THE PAYMENT OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES UNDER THE ACT DOES NOT EXTINGUISH THE LANDLORDS OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW IS STILL REQUIRED. I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS ON AMENDMENTS THAT WILL TAKE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND ARE CLOSE TO REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. WHICH I HOPE TO HAVE RESOLVED BY THE NEXT DURING. THIS BILL GETS TENANTS SOME SECURITY AND KEEPING THEIR HOMES IN A TIME WHEN HOMELESSNESS FOR OUR POOR SENIORS DISABLED AND EVEN WORKING CLASS IS A REALITY THAT MAY. BE JUST A PAYCHECK OR RENT INCREASE AWAY DUE THE LACK OF READILY AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH BRIAN AUGUSTA HERE TO ADD HIS COMMENTS. THANK YOU FIRST WHAT A SECOND CHAIR MEMBER TRYING TO GUESS IT JUST LET ME CLARIFY ONE THING -- A MY FATHER MISTER BURN READ IT THAT WAY BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN THOSE. AMENDMENTS TO SATISFY THE REALTORS OPPOSITION THOSE ARE IN PRINT AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM THEM THAT THEIR OPPOSITION IS REMOVED -- WE ARE WORKING ON SOME LAST MINUTE. DISCUSSIONS WERE DOWN TO ONE WORD WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND AND IF YOU WORK IN THIS BUILDING OF THAT THAT WERE PROBABLY MATTERS AND SO WE'RE VERY CLOSE THOUGH AND WE HAVE GOTTEN. I THINK --  97% OF THE WAY THERE SO THIS BILL AS MISTER BLOOM AS DISCUSSED. MAKE SIMPLE CLARIFYING CHANGES TO THE LAW TO REALLY ENSURE THAT THE ACT -- THAT CLARIFIES THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE ACT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE IS ONE WHICH ALL DATE AND THERE'S ONE DATE FOR RETURNING THE UNITS. TO THE RENTAL MARKET NOT ONLY WILL THIS HELP. PROVIDE CLARITY TO BOTH PROPERTY OWNERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. BUT IT WILL ALSO REDUCE A POTENTIAL LITIGATION OVER THAT REMAINING AMBIGUITY -- LITIGATION THAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IN MISTER ROOMS DISTRICT AND SO WE THINK WITH THOSE CLARIFYING CHANGES. WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE ARE. REDUCE OUT LITIGATION AND PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR BOTH PROPERTY OWNERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PROTECT. TENANTS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ORDERED AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. MITCHELL PARASITE WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. YES THE LEASH ON BEHALF OF CITY SANTA MONICA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TO PROTECT TENANTS THANK YOU. KAELIN DEAN ON BEHALF OF POLICY LINK PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL. SASHA HER NAME AT THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. RAND MORE NOW WE HAVE THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALI I PHELPS ON BEHALF OF ACE IN SUPPORT. QUESTION A LOT OF PICOULT CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT COMMITTEE AROUND KINGSTON I REPRESENT THREE OF REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS EAST BAY RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION. ASSOCIATION ORANGE COUNTY AND THE APARTMENT SITUATION CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CITIES WE HAVE ONE ISSUE WITH THE BILL. WHICH WE STRONGLY BELIEVE. ACTUALLY WILL HURT. BOTH PARTIES. THE BILL AS AMENDED APRIL TWENTY FIFTH JUST LAST WEEK. PAGE SIX ONE SENTENCE RIGHT THE LAST SENTENCE OF THAT PAGE. SAYS IN PERTINENT PART. THAT SHOULD I AS A PROPERTY OWNER EXTEND THE TIME PERIOD FOR A TENANT TO MOVE. THAT THAT EXTENDS ALL THE TIME PERIODS FOR ALL THE OTHER TENANTS TO MOVE -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A STRONG INCENTIVE. FOR THE PROPERTY OWNER NEVER TO GIVE AN ACCOMMODATION OR EXTENSION OF TIME SO THAT TEN IT CAN MOVE. BECAUSE THE TENANT HAS COME TO US AND SAID WE NEED ANOTHER MONTH OR TWO MONTHS OUR NEW RENTAL UNIT IS NOT AVAILABLE QUITE YET. NOW IF THIS BILL SHOULD BE SIGNED INTO LAW. I CAN TELL YOU THE ADVICE TO OUR CLIENTS. WHO DECIDE TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS WOULD WOULD DETERMINE THAT THEY WILL NOT EXTEND THE -- RENTAL UNIT FOR ONE TENANT -- AND CONSEQUENTLY IT WILL HURT THAT ONE TENANT PERHAPS TO TENANTS. WE HAVE BEEN IN ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH MISTER BLOOM AND WITH THE SPONSORS -- BRANDS LOOKING. LOOKING LIKE HE WANTS TO TALK TO THIS -- AND WE HAVE. HAD DISCUSSIONS LAST NIGHT THIS MORNING HOW DO WE FIX THIS WE FIX THIS BY SAYING IF YOU. AS A PROPERTY OWNER DECIDE TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS. AND DECIDE TO EXTEND -- THE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR ONE OF THE TENANTS -- BECAUSE OF THE REQUEST OF THE TENET DUE TO THE REQUEST OF THE TENET THAT THAT SHALL ONLY APPLY TO THAT ONE TENANTS. NOT TO EVERYBODY WHO IS ALREADY DECIDED TO MOVE IT CETERA SO THAT'S OUR REQUEST TO FIX. THIS ONE SENTENCE OR SUBPARAGRAPH PAID. SIX LINE FORTY WOULD CHANGE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT OUR REQUEST IS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AS INTRODUCED C. R. DID HAVE AN OPPOSED LIST AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL HOWEVER THE APRIL TWENTY FIFTH THE MEN'S -- DO SATISFY OUR CONCERNS AND AGAIN WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH US TO RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THIS WILL PERHAPS YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. IT JUST SEEMS THAT AND I'M NOT SURE THAT'S WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED ACTUALLY CUTS A BECAUSE IF THE PROPER AIR IS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS AND FOR SOME REASON EXTENDS ONE TENET WHY WOULDN'T THEY EXTENT ALL THE OTHER TENANTS. BUT THEN I THINK THE QUESTION IS DOES THAT. CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR. PRIOR TO THE DECISION TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND WHAT THE INITIAL SORT OF CURVE IS AS I UNDERSTAND THIS BUT HOT PROPERTY WHAT I I I I I DON'T THINK SO I THINK YOUR THE FIRST PART OF YOUR ANALYSIS IS THE ONE THAT REALLY APPLIES HERE -- WE'VE ONLY HAD THIS ISSUE SINCE. MID DAY YESTERDAY -- BUT MISTER GUS HAS GIVEN IT SOME THOUGHT AND TO LET HIM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN STEP. JUST TO EXPAND FURTHER THAT'S NOT WHAT MISTER KING SENATE'S DESCRIBE IS NOT THE INTENT OF THAT SECTION THE ONLY PURPOSE. OF THAT LANGUAGE. IS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WHATEVER THE TIME PERIODS ARE OF ALL THE TENANTS. IN THE BUILDING SO SOME MAY HAVE A SHORTER NOTICE AND SOME MAY HAVE A LONGER NOTICE BECAUSE THE LAW ALLOWS FOR EXAMPLE. SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES TO HAVE UP TO A YEAR NOTICE -- AND SO YOU MAY HAVE DIFFERENT. TIME PERIODS DIFFERENT NOTICE PERMITS IS IS OF THE BILL IS TO CLARIFY THAT THE WITHDRAWAL DATE FOR DETERMINING WHEN ALL THE OTHER TIME LINES IN THE BILL. FOR THE LOG BEGIN TO RUN THAT THAT DATE IS TRIGGERED. A BY THE LAST TENANT -- THAT TENANTS TERMINATION DATE SO THAT THERE ARE NOT MULTIPLE WITHDRAWAL THERE'S THERE'S ONLY ONE AND IT'S THE LAST DATE THAT THE LAST AND IT. MOVES OUT ESSENTIALLY AND THAT'S THAT'S WITHOUT LANGUAGES INTENDED TO DO THE FACT THAT MR KINGS AND REPORTS SAY THIS WE HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF TIME TO CONSIDER HIS COMMENTS BUT THAT'S OUR GOAL AND I THINK WHAT HE'S DESCRIBING IT'S NOT -- IMPLICATED BY THAT LANGUAGE IN ANY WAY THEN. THE OWNER STILL MAINTAINS THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO EXTEND TENANTS ARE NOT BUT OUR OUR LANGUAGE AS A CHANGE THAT AT ALL IT JUST SAYS. THIS BAT LAST DATE THE LAST TENANT THAT'S THAT WITHDRAWAL DATE THAT'S ALL WE'RE DOING THERE. OKAY SO IF THE IF IF THERE'S A DEAL TO BE HAD HERE AND AND AND ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP WORKING ON IT I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU MAKE SURE YOU. LOOK BACK THAT WHATEVER CHANGES YOU COME WITH THE COMMITTEES THAT WE HAVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THAT GOES YEAH THAT WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND WE WILL -- REFERENCE BACK ANY CHANGES. TO OKAY THANK YOU -- ANYBODY ELSE WAS GALLAGHER. THIS SO TO THE OPPOSITION IT IF IF THAT. IF THIS IS IF YOU WERE TO BE ADDRESS WOULD YOU GUYS BE MOVING TO A SUPPORT POSITION OR A NEUTRAL POSITION -- NEUTRAL MR GALLAGHER OKAY AND I I THINK LISTENING. TO YOU AND YET IS QUESTION SO YOU KNOW AND I I THINK WHAT MISTER KING SIN IS GAIN AS NOT THE STATUTORY. NOTICE REQUIREMENTS BUT SAY THAT THEY ACCOMMODATE A TENANT. YOU KNOW THAT THE STATUTORY TIMED NOTICE TIME TO GET OUT IS LET'S SAY IT'S A YEAR FOR SENIORS -- IF THEY ACCOMMODATE THAT TEN AND IN THE END OF THE YEAR IS COMING UP AND THE AND THAT TEN IT SAYS HEY. I NEED. NO MAYBE ANOTHER COUPLE MONTHS RIGHT AFTER THE STATUTORY NOTICE. PERIOD IS ALREADY RUN. AND THEY GIVE THAT PERSON AN ACCOMMODATION. SHOULD THAT EXTEND IT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. YOU KNOW THE REST OF THOSE DEADLINES AND I IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE REALLY GETTING THAT NOT THAT IF. YEAH I MEAN THE DEADLINE IS WHATEVER IT IS RIGHT DEPENDING ON THE STATUS OF THE PERSON THAT'S INVOLVED -- BUT IF YOU ACCOMMODATE SOMEONE IN THAT AND THEY EXTEND BEYOND BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP. THERE ARE PARTICULAR SPECIFIC SITUATION SHOULD THAT ALSO EXTEND. THE DATE FOR EVERYBODY ELSE'S AB YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING YES MISTER GALLAGHER I THINK ACTUALLY HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING MISTER KING SINCE ARGUMENT TENDING AND HE HAS SO THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK WE WILL -- IN LIGHT OF THAT AND WILL CERTAINLY GO BACK AND TALK FURTHER ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT MIGHT BE AND SEE IF THERE ISN'T SOME COMPROMISE THEIR IT. I'M NOT ONE OF COURSE NOT SPEAKING FOR THE AUTHOR. THAT'S CERTAINLY MY POSITION. THANK YOU THIS FEATURE IS. THIS DOES SEEM TO ME LIKE A VERY COMMON SENSE APPROACH AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR. FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO THIS POINT TO NEGOTIATE AND ENGAGE WITH THE OPPOSITION I AND FOR YOUR CONTINUED WILLINGNESS TO DO SO. AND GIVEN THAT AND VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU WE'RE PLEASED TO AFTER TWO YEARS THAT WERE CLOSE TO A RESOLUTION. RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SIGNAL MISTER BLOOM YOU MAY CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND THAT MOTION IS DUE PASSED CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I CHAO. CHU. CHU AYE GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN. HI MAIENSCHEIN I OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE I PETRIE-NORRIS. NORTH AYE RACE. RACE AYE. THAT BILL IS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER SANTIAGO SO THIS TAKES US TO ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN A. B.. FIFTEEN SIXTY THREE ONE OF FIRST BANK -- THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HELPING US. TO CONTINUE THIS WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE ACCEPT ALL THE AMENDMENTS ON STRETCHERS YOU KNOW AB FIFTEEN SIXTY THREE WOULD ADD ANOTHER LAYER PROTECTION. AT THE MOST AFFORDABLE POPULATIONS AND ENCOURAGE GREATER CENSUS PARTICIPATION -- BY PREVENTING ANYBODY FROM FALLS FALSELY REPRESENTING THEMSELVES HAD TO BE STATE LOCAL OR FEDERAL OFFICIAL -- EMPLOYEE WITH THE INTENT THAT -- TO GATHER OTHER INFORMATION FROM BOOKS. THANK MISTER OUR STATE LAST NIGHT ABOUT THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE. ALL RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER GALLAGHER. SO I MEAN MY QUESTION THIS BILL WAS LIKE ARE WE ARE WE ACTUALLY SEEN THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY OCCURRED. THE WOMEN WE HAVE BEEN BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SENSE IS COMING UP AND I MEAN IT IT HAPPENED IN THE LAST CENSUS AT ALL I MEAN THAT'S I'M KIND OF TRYING TO SEE IF THIS IS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM. WHY DO I BELIEVE IT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM ABSOLUTELY -- SO I'D LIKE TO PREVENT THE PROBLEM FROM GETTING GREATER. WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM? WHAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM I MEAN LET'S LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THIS OKAY SO LET'S GET TO THE CORE THE QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING? RIGHT -- AND LET'S GET TO THE CORE OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO PREVENT I WOULDN'T WANT TO ANY AGENTS -- THAT ARE NOT CENSUS EMPLOYEES KNOCKING ON DOORS ASKING PEOPLE FOR IMMIGRATION STATUS -- AND THEN -- THE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT INFORMATION IN DOING OTHERWISE. I WOULD SENSES WORKER WOULDN'T DO WHICH IS JUST COLLECT INFORMATION BUT LOOK. THE OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT HERE TOO IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA GETS ALL THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS WHICH I THINK WE WOULD BOTH AGREE. RIGHT BUT THIS COULD ALSO APPLY TO OTHER YOU KNOW IS I MEAN I I HAVE I GET THAT MAYBE THE TARGET IS LIKE ICE. BUT WHAT IF IT'S JUST. SOME OTHER RANDOM GROUP THAT'S REPRESENTED THERE A CENSUS TAKER JUST TRYING TO GET INFORMATION. WELL I WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY FALSIFYING WHO THEY ARE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR I THINK WE BOTH AGREED -- THAT WE WANT THE PUBLIC -- THE PUBLIC TO BE SAFE -- IF YOUR SENSES WORKER THEN THAT'S FINE YOU CAN FIGURE CENSUS WORKER -- BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE MOST REASONABLE PEOPLE WOULD AGREE -- THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT SOMEBODY MISREPRESENTING -- WHO THEY ARE WHEN THEY'RE NOT GONNA DOOR RIGHT -- YEAH I MEAN. I GUESS FOR MORE SPECIFIC TALKING ABOUT ICE OR ANY OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OUT OUT THERE. I SUPPOSE THAT THERE ARE. YOU KNOW THEY USE STING OPERATIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY USE IT IN THIS EXACT FASHION. AGAIN I NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS EVER. COMING UP AS AN ACTUAL -- THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THEY ACTUALLY DID -- BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES HAVE IN IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES RIGHT I I WOULD ASSUME YOU WOULD WANT FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO GO OUT AND USE STING OPERATIONS TO GET OUT POLLUTERS. YOU KNOW YOU WOULD WANT YOU KNOW DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO WHATEVER THEIR PURPOSES. WHATEVER THEY ARE TASKED WITH ENFORCING YOU WOULD WANT THEM TO GO OUT. AND ENFORCE THE LAW THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ENFORCE RIGHT EVEN IF WE MIGHT. LOOK. I THINK A LOT OF US AGREE APPEAR THAT. IMMIGRATION LAW HAS A LOT THERE'S A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT AND HE'S BEING MADE. TO IMMIGRATION LAW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT NONE THE LESS WE DO HAVE TO ENFORCE THE LAW. AND I THINK IN ANY OTHER CAPACITY WOULD WANT TO SAY -- HADE AGENCY DON'T ENFORCE THE LAW DON'T USE YOUR ENFORCEMENT POWERS. TO DO THAT RIGHT. YOU MAY RESPOND OUT ALWAYS WANTING YOU RESPOND I WAS TRYING. TO PUT OUT LIKE THIS COULD HAVE. OTHER PRESIDENTIAL IMPLICATIONS RIGHT THAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING. WELL NUMBER ONE THE ONE SAYING FOLLOW OR DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW IN THIS BILL WITH THIS VERY VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT NOT IMPERSONATING -- ANY INDIVIDUAL SO LET'S TAKE THAT OFF THE TABLE NUMBER TWO IF YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT I NEVER HEARD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PRETENDING TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE WALKING IN IN IT. AND IF THERE IS A STING OPERATION THERE IS ALREADY A SET PROCESS IN PLACE -- WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY OF THAT BASICALLY WHAT THIS SAYS IS YOU CANNOT IMPERSONATE SOMEONE -- WHAT WHEN YOU'RE NOT GOOD LORD WE KNOCKING OR TALKING TO SOMEBODY TO COLLECT INFORMATION? SO I DON'T SEE ANY OF THOSE OTHER ARGUMENTS BEING RELATIVE BUT IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE YOU JUST CAN'T FALSIFY -- IF YOU IF YOU'RE A PUBLIC -- EMPLOYEE OR AN OFFICIAL -- TO SAY THAT YOUR FEDERAL AGENT -- GETTING OTHER SORTS OF INFORMATION PRETTY SIMPLE PRETTY NARROW BUT BUT I THINK YOU MOST REASONABLE PEOPLE WOULD AGREE -- THAT ANY OF THE OTHER LAWS THAT ARE IN THE BOOKS WE WOULD WANT THEM UP HELD THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A BUT LOOK I TELL YOU AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH I THINK. MOST REASONABLE PEOPLE WOULD AGREE -- THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD GET ITS FAIR SHARE FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND DO SO IN AND WE NEED PEOPLE OUT THERE TAKEN. CENSUS INFORMATION RIGHT AND SO. THE TWO I'M ON THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE WE WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS RIGHT NOW -- YOU KNOW I'M JUST. NO WONDER WHAT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF OF THIS MIGHT BE I I THINK MAYBE COULD EVEN BE SOMETHING THAT MIGHT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT RAY AND AND TAKING CENSUS INFORMATION I THINK THE ONLY INFORMATION IS THAT IS THAT GIVEN THE SENSITIVITY AND GIVEN THE FEAR. FOR MISUSE OF THE SYSTEM ALL THIS SAYS IS WHATEVER YOU CANNOT REPRESENT YOURSELF AS A CENSUS TAKER MUST YOUR CENSUS TAKER THAT'S THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES. AND I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING LIKE COULD THIS STOP COMMUNITY GROUPS FROM MAYBE GOING OUT AND HELPING WITH CENSUS NOTE COLLECTION THAT COULD BE ONE THING. AND THEN AND THEN I GUESS. YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S MANY CASES WERE LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES DO UNDER COVER OPERATIONS WHERE THEY DO REPRESENT THEMSELVES TO BE. SOMETHING SOMETHING ELSE. IN ORDER TO GET OUT A LEGAL ACTIVITY. AND SO. YOU KNOW DOES THAT SWORE LEGITIMATE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AS IS OR IS MY IS MY CONCERNS OF THE BILL I I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM WITH IT. BUT I THINK THERE COULD BE OTHER IMPLICATIONS. THAT WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPOND YES. WHAT NUMBER ONE AT THE I WOULD TAKE BECOME BUT ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T PREVENT THEM IN IT? AND IF YOU THINK THAT DOES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT YOU THINK THAT -- WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY A PROCESS IN PLACE -- AND IT DOESN'T STOP COMMUNITY GROUPS FROM PARTICIPATING ANY ANY CENSUS WORK EITHER BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT IMPERSONATING THEMSELVES FALSELY THEN THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO ANY SORT OF WORK -- YOU AND I CAN CONTINUE -- TO KNOCK ON DOORS WITH THIS IN YOUR DISTRICT OR MY DISTRICT TO HELP PEOPLE -- GET COUNTED FOR THE CENSUS -- ALL IT SAYS IS YOU AND I COULDN'T -- MRS REPRESENT OURSELVES A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SAY THAT WERE A CENSUS WORKER AND COLLECT OTHER INFORMATION -- THAT'S ALL IT SAYS. SO I MEAN I THINK IF -- I MEAN IF YOU DON'T IF IF -- I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE PASSES A BILL THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T FALSIFY WHO YOU ARE -- WHEN YOU'RE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR? OR COLLECTING INFORMATION. THANK YOU THIS IS US. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. THIS PREVENTS ONE ACTIVITY THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT MIGHT UTILIZE -- HOWEVER DISGUSTINGLY -- TO GET INFORMATION FROM AN INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE THEM SELF REPORT THAT THEY'RE NOT -- HERE WITH DOCUMENTATION CRACKED JUST ONE ACTIVITY THAT'S LITERALLY IMPERSONATING A CENSUS TAKER OR OR ANYBODY ELSE RIGHT AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO KNOCKS ON THE DOOR WHO SAYS. GRAHAM -- CENSUS WORKER CRACKED I I'M JUST I I'M I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED WHAT ROAD WE'RE GOING DOWN WITH MY COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION. SO SO. ICE CAN STILL HOLD BOGUS -- COME PICK UP YOUR LOTTO WINNIE AND STING OPERATIONS THEY CAN STILL GO TO A DOOR IF THEY HAVE AN ARREST WARRANT THEY CAN STILL PULL PEOPLE OVER IF THEY IF THEY HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT -- THEY'RE HERE UNLAWFULLY IS THAT CORRECT THIS WOULD BE CORRECT THE DIFFERENCE IS THEY COULD NOT IMPERSONATE SO THE ONLY ACTIVITY ON THIS THAT WE'RE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. IS NOT TO BE THAT SO PRECIOUS AND SOME POINT WERE PUTTING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO OUR BUDGET ON TOP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDS BECAUSE WE WANT A COMPLETE COUNT AND ALL WE'RE SAYING IS. NOBODY SHOULD GO TO A DOOR. AND SAY I AM A CENSUS TAKER IF THEY ARE NOT CORRECT THAT IS ALL THIS LADAS PLANE SIMPLY I AM OF THE BILL. SO I THINK IF WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MR CHOLERA AND THE MISTER OPEN ALL DAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SUMMER SANTIAGO FIRMING THIS BILL I THINK IT'S THIS HAS CREDIBILITY. TO THE CENSUS TAKING PROCESS. THE REALITY IS AND ALONG FORSMAN CONTACTS WERE TALKING ABOUT STING OPERATIONS WHAT HAVE YOU -- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO USE AS A ONE OFF INTERACTION THAT CENSUS TAKERS HAVE. WITHIN IT WITH INDIVIDUALS AS A RUSE -- THE THE ONES THAT WOULD MOST LIKELY USE IT WAS OUR ICE OR OTHER IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT WHICH ARE NOT PEACE OFFICERS UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. AND IT ALL COMES UNDER PUBLIC POLICY DISCUSSION THE DECISION ON A BALANCING ACT AT THE END OF THE DAY. A. N. ONE ICE AGENT. IMPERSONATING A CENSUS TAKER FOR THE PURPOSES OF DOING THEIR INVESTIGATION BECAUSE SUCH CHILLING AFFECT. A DRUM I MEAN RIGHT RIGHT NOW WHEN I'M IN SAN JOSE AND THERE'S EVEN A RUMOR. THAT ICE IS IN IT IS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD -- IN TOWN. EVERYONE OF A RAISE THE ALARM AND SO THIS IS ABOUT AN ACCURATE COUNT THAT'S WHAT THE SENSE ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT NEVER SHOULD BE. AND WE HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT STAKE. AND SO -- IT'S REALLY PUZZLING THAT WE WOULDN'T WANT EVERYONE I I'D BE SHOCKED IF THIS IS NOT A BIPARTISAN UNANIMOUS VOTE TO MAKE SURE THOSE ARE ASKING. THAT ARE UP. ARE PUTTING THEMSELVES FORGED ESSENCE TAKERS ARE ACTUAL CENSUS TAKERS HEY IT'S I I DON'T I DON'T SEE HOW IT'S ANY MORE SUPPORT IN THAT. AND BE ABSOLUTELY DON'T WANT ICE ANYWHERE NEAR THE CENSUS TAKING PROCESS -- UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT AN UNDERCOUNT. OF OF THOSE THAT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD REACT TO THAT CHILLING EFFECT AND I REALLY WOULD HOPE THAT NO COMPANY LEGISLATOR WOULD WANT THAT. THANK YOU MR BRILL THING -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE IS SUPPORTIVE OF OF MY QUESTION IS. MY READING OF STATE LOG INDICATES THAT THAT'S ALREADY ILLEGAL FALLS PERSON NATIONS ALREADY A CRIME UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE PENAL CODE SO HOW DOES THIS BILL DO ANYTHING MORE THAT'S NOT ALREADY ON THE BOOKS. OR WILL IT WHEN WE WANT TO PUT AN EXTRA LAYER ON A PLAIN AND SIMPLE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU'RE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU HAD A HESITATION ABOUT OPENING THAT DOOR. THAT YOU ARE INSURED 1100% -- THAT THIS INFORMATION WILL NOT BE USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE AND AND I WOULD ECHO WHAT I SAID EARLIER WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID LOOK AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE CERTAINLY LOOK THERE IS -- WHAT DO YOU ROOT WHATEVER SIDE OF THE AISLE YOU'RE ON? IT THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO ACCESS AS MANY DOLLARS AS POSSIBLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE IT'S QUITE FRANKLY BI PARTISAN ISSUE WITH THE YOUR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RULE AREAS. OR URBAN AREAS LIKE I REPRESENT YOU WANT YOUR POPULATIONS COUNTY BECAUSE WHAT'S AT STAKE IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- AND SO THE ATTEMPT AT THIS IS TO ACT AN EXTRA LAYER OF PROTECTION LIKE I MENTIONED AND THEN TO THE SIGNAL AND ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS -- DOCUMENTARY AND DOCUMENT UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW AND THAT THE INFORMATION WILL NOT BE USED FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE PERSON AT THE DOOR -- IS NOT A FALSIFYING WHO THEY ARE. BUT IT DOESN'T PREVENT. ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN THAT ONE PARTICULAR ACT. OF KNOCKING ON SOMEONE'S DOOR NOW HE'S KNOCKING THE THAT'S ONE GENERAL WAY THAT HAPPENS. AND SAYING -- THEY CAN STILL KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SAY WHO THEY ARE THEY JUST CAN'T KNOCK ON THE DOOR SAY ON THE CENSUS WORKER COLLECT INFORMATION AND THEN DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH IT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. IT AND TO BE CLEAR THIS IS ACTUALLY AN AREA THAT'S A LITTLE THAT IS NOT THAT CLEAR UNDERSTATE LAW OR FEDERAL LAW. BECAUSE THOSE LAWS ARE TYPICALLY. TO PREVENT SOMEONE FROM. POSING AS AN OFFICIAL IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO SOMETHING OF VALUE. THIS IS DOCUMENTATION STATUS IS. ARGUABLY NOT IN THAT CATEGORY SO WE FIELD AND THAT'S WHY -- SUPPORTING THIS BILL WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A POTENTIAL LOOPHOLE AND GIVEN THE CHILLING THE FACT. THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAD NOT REALLY BEEN CONTEMPLATED PRIOR. IT WAS GALLAGHER. SO JUST TO GET KIND OF MORE SPECIFIC ON THE LANGUAGE -- THIS SECTION WHERE IT SAYS OR FALSELY ASSUME THE ROLE OF SO IT. I GET I GET A FALSE REPRESENTATION I'M A CENSUS WORKER AND I'M HERE TO GET INFORMATION THAT'S ONE THING BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF NONPROFIT GROUPS INVOLVED IN THE CENSUS. GOING OUT AND I MEAN ARE. ARE THEY ASSUMING THE MAYBE THEY'RE NOT AN OFFICIAL CENSUS WORKER BUT THERE. YOU ENCOURAGING PEOPLE GETTING PEOPLE INVOLVED IN MAKING SURE THEY FILL OUT CENSUS DATA. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT LEAVE IT'S A LITTLE BIT. WHAT IS ASSUMING THE ROLE OF A CENSUS WORKER YOU KNOW I THINK? IN A NICE TO KINDA TIGHTEN UP SOME OF THAT LANGUAGE I GUESS I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE TIGHTENING UP BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE THE THE ALL THE BILL SAYS IT SHALL BE UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON TO FALSELY REPRESENT THEMSELVES TO BE IN ON A PUBLIC. OFFICIAL OR PUBLIC EMPLOYEE CONDUCTING A GOVERNMENT CENSUS WITH A KNOWING INTENT TO DECEIVE AND AND DOCUMENTARY -- THAT'S THE WORST THAT. THAT'S ABOUT OKAY. I'M SORRY MS GALLAGHER. I WAS LOOKING AT THAT ONE OKAY. AGAIN THE KEY I MEAN THIS THIS WAS A A COMMITTEE MEMBER THE KEY TO THAT IS THAT THEY ARE FALSELY ASSUMING THAT ROLE SO I DON'T THINK THAT RUNS AFOUL OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN. WHO IS ASSISTING? IN THE IN THE THE UNDERTAKING SO SOMEONE WHO IS ASSISTING IT NOT NECESSARILY SAYING THAT THEY'RE A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL BUT SAYING WE ARE ASSISTING THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL BUT ON A FULL SPACES OR TO COLLECT INFORMATION. THAT'S WHERE THAT LIKE WHICH IS INTENDED TO COVER. WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT TO WORK OUT WE SEE -- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT TO WORK ON LANGUAGE ANYWAYS SO. YEAH THAT THAT WAS KIND OF YOU KNOW. MY CONCERN. RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RIGHT SIGNAL MISTER SANTIAGO YOU MAY CLOSE I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN RESPECT LAST FOR FOR AN I. BOWED AND WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR ARE WORKING HELPS CLARIFY WHERE WE'RE GOING THANK YOU. THANK YOU BUT WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE I GALLAGHER [inaudible] CHOW. TWO BY CHU I CONSOLIDATES. HOLDEN. HOLDEN I KALRA. COLDER I KYLIE. MAIN SHINE HI MAIN SHINE I OVER MULTI. CRIMINAL T. I. PETRI NORRIS. BEACH NORTH I RAISE. THAT BILL IS OUT THANK YOU. I THINK THAT BRINGS US TO MISS COME AUGER DEATH SO ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN AB. SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE GOOD MORNING THE CHAIR MEMBERS. I AM HERE TO PRESENT. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE WHICH WILL REQUIRE LANDLORDS IF THEY SEEK TO DISPLACE THE TENANT OR LEASE SEE UNDER THE ELLIS ACT. TO PROHIBIT ACCESS TO THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION RECORDS AND REQUIRE THE LANDLORD TO IDENTIFY THE TYPE OF UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION IN THE CAPTION OF THE LANDLORDS COMPLAINT. AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE WOULD ENSURE THAT WHEN A LANDLORD HAS ELECTED TO EVICT A TENANT UNDER THE LS ACT. NOT A PUBLIC EVICTION RECORD DOES NOT UNFAIRLY PENALIZE THOSE TENANTS SO CURRENTLY. WHEN A LANDLORD DECIDES TO RECLAIM THEIR PROPERTY THEY CAN EVEN ACT A TENANT -- BUT WHAT WILL IN IT AN ADVERT ONLY HAPPEN IS. HE VIXEN WILL SHOW UP ON THE TENANTS CREDIT REPORT. EVEN THOUGH WHILE TECHNICALLY THEY WERE AFFECTED THEY WERE EVICTED THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN SO THIS IS A RATHER SENSIBLE AND PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO THAT SITUATION THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS WE KNOW. THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH NOW. AND THE LACK OF SUPPLY MAKES IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR TENANTS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR RENTAL UNITS TO FIND THEM AND IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM. IF THEY HAVE THIS THE VIXEN ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT. IT IS ALSO I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR LANDLORDS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR PROSPECTIVE TENANTS -- TO FIND THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT A SHRINKING POOL OF PROSPECTIVE TENANTS BECAUSE THERE ARE FOLKS OUT THERE THAT HAVE THE VIXEN NOTICES ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT WHEN THEY'VE BEEN EVICTED THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. SO THIS BILL AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE WOULD ADDRESS THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. AND WITH ME I HAVE IN SUPPORT LARRY DOLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR ASSOCIATION AND BRING BRIAN AUGUSTA WITH THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. THANK YOU FOR SWISS PLACE MORNING LARRY DOYLE AND HAVE THE CONFERENCE THE CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS NO LONGER THE STATE BAR. FOR BUT STILL -- AND THIS IS A I REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO ADD TO THIS DEBATE OTHER THAN WHAT WAS IN THE ANALYSIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL. ANALYSIS THAT GOES THROUGH THE DETAILS AS TO THE WHY OF THE BILL. THE REASONS THAT THE IT IS TAKING WE'VE TAKEN SUCH AN INCREDIBLY FOCUSED. EFFORT TRYING TO FIX. HAVE A MENTAL EXCLUSIVELY ON ELLIS ACTIVATIONS WHERE THERE IS NO FAULT WHATSOEVER IN PART ON THE PART OF THE TENANT. BUT WHERE THE TENANT IS UNDER CURRENT LAW. POSSIBLY BEING CAUGHT WITH A BROAD BRUSH AND HAVING THEIR REPUTATION OF THEIR ABILITY TO GIVE SUBSEQUENT HOUSING -- TAKEN AWAY IT'S A IT'S YEAH I THINK WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB WE APPRECIATE. HIS CATALOGUER DOVE -- CARRYING THE BILLING WE AS FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT A SPLIT MIXTURE MEMBER MEMBERS BRIAN AUGUSTA. WITH THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. WE KNOW FROM TALKING TO ATTORNEYS IN OUR FIELD OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE EVERY DAY THAT. AND IT'S AN AFFECTION ON YOUR RECORD AS THE AUTHOR DISCUSSED WILL HAVE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR ABILITY TO FIND. HOUSING AND IN THIS INSTANCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ELSE ACTIVE ACTION IN WHICH THERE IS. NO FAULT ON THE TENANTS PART -- THE LANDLORD IS GETTING OUT OF THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS THERE'S A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT. THAT ACTION MIGHT BE FILED IN THAT MIGHT ULTIMATELY END UP ON THE TENANTS CREDIT REPORT AND IMPAIR THEIR ABILITY. TO RENT HOUSING FOR SEVEN PLUS YEARS AND THIS IS A SENSIBLE PROTECTION THAT SAYS. WE RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT FALL AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA KEEP THAT MASKED SO THAT THAT DOES NOT BECOME PART OF THE TENANTS. PERMANENT RECORD AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE VIRGIN ABOUT. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. I SUPPORT THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF THESE THANK YOU. YES I'M WILLIAM CASEY WITH A SIDE DEFINITELY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. SASHA HER NAME AT THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND SUPPORT -- RUBBER CALLED A SECOND A TENNIS YOU NEED SUPPORT. MICHELLE PARASITE WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. CHRISTIAN ALONE -- PICO CALIFORNIA SUPPORT. JAMES DALE'S AMAZE I SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND JUST HEARD AGAIN IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE IS THEIR OPPOSITION HI GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS NEVER CALLED FOR THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. FIRST OF ALL LET ME STATE OUT OF ALL DUE RESPECT THERE SHOULD NEVER BE AN EVICTION IN THIS SITUATION. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION BEING CREATED HERE. THERE IS AND WE HAD ALWAYS WORKED IN GOOD FAITH TO CREATE LONG TERM NOTICES SO IN THIS CASE OF THE ELLIS ACT. TENANTS ARE GIVEN IN MANY CASES A YEAR NOTICE IT'S NOT A FORMAL OBJECTION. WHAT'S HAPPENING UNFORTUNATELY IN MANY OF OUR RENT CONTROL JURISDICTIONS ON DAY. THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE AN ATTORNEY HELPS ATTENDED STAY IN THE UNIT BY SAYING DON'T LEAVE. FORCE THE EVICTION ACTED ACTION TO TAKE PLACE. THE OWNERS ALREADY COMMITTED TO EXTENSIVE RELOCATION COSTS IN SAN FRANCISCO THERE'SEXTENSIVE RELOCATION COSTS. AND NOW. BECAUSE THE THE TENANT HAS NOT LEFT AFTER THAT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAY NOTICE. THERE IS A FORMAL OBJECTION THAT IS FILED. THE OWNER AND LET ME MAKE IT ALSO CLEAR THESE OWNERS ARE NOT LARGE OWNERS THEY'RE VERY SMALL OWNERS. IN MANY CASES THE AVERAGE SIZE OF AN ELLIS ACT IS ABOUT TEN UNITS VERY SMALL SO IT'S A MOM AND POP NOW AFTER PAYING RELOCATION. AND NOW BEING FORCED TO FILE AN EVICTION BECAUSE THEY IN MOST CASES WANT TO MOVE INTO THE UNIT THEMSELVES -- HAVE TO NOW PAY AN ATTORNEY. IN MOST CASES IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING RENT BECAUSE THE TENANT IS NOT GOING TO PAY RENT UNDER THIS SITUATION. SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THERE SHOULD NEVER BE AN EVICTION THIS CASE BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE NOTICE THAT IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED. AND WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION -- CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING WOULD BE PROUD THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL -- AT THIS TIME WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS. ABOUT THE BILLS CUTTING OFF ACCESS TO THE COURT RECORDS AND REALLY CUTTING OFF THE ONLY MEANINGFUL WAY THAT A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC OR JOURNALIST OF THEY'RE INVESTIGATING THESE ISSUES. COULD GET ACCESS TO THOSE RECORDS THEY BASICALLY HAVE TO KNOW ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CASES ARE READY TO GET ACCESS. UNDER THE BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN -- WE'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND HAVING A GOOD DIALOGUE THERE SO WE'RE HOPING WE CAN WORK OUT. MORE NARROW WAY -- TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM THIS BILLS AIMED AT THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS THIS REBUILDING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THE ELSE ACT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS. THAT UNDER THE ACT YOU CAN PROVIDE NOTICE AND THE TENTATIVE SUPPOSED TO MOVE OUT AT THE END OF THAT NOTICE PERIOD OF THE TENANT DOESN'T MOVE OUT AT THE END OF THAT NOTICE PERIOD. THEN YOU HAVE TO FILE AN EVICTION UNDER THE ELLIS ACT SO THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT. YOUR BILL WOULD BE -- FOR PROTECTING OTHER PEOPLE THAT REFUSED TO MOVE OUT AFTER THE END OF THE NOTICE PERIOD IS THAT RIGHT BECAUSE I I'M JUST I'M JUST WONDERING WHEN A WALK. IT IF THESE PEOPLE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN HAD TO MOVE OUT THEN I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT BUT IF THEY REFUSED TO MOVE OUT MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT SHOULD BE OF CONCERN TO A FUTURE LANDLORDS OF JUST. WONDERING HOW YOU REACT TO THAT THAT [inaudible] ADAM. JOE DIRT TWO THINGS ON THAT QUESTION I AM ONE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS IN WHICH AT THE TIME PERIOD THAT AS A LANDLORD MIGHT BE ENTITLED TO FILE THEIR ACTION. THERE. ARE THAT THE ACTION COULD BE FILED WITHOUT THE TENANT. WELL WE SEE FREQUENTLY AN ACTION FILED EVEN THOUGH THE TENNIS COMPLIED WITH THE NOTICE SO THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ACTION WOULD BE FILED. AND THE TENANT HAD MOVED OUT AND SO THEN THEY WOULD BE IMPLICATED POTENTIALLY IN ESSENCE -- TO IF THE ACTION WERE PROSECUTED FURTHER BY THE LANDLORD. SECONDLY THERE MAY ACTUALLY BE A LEGITIMATE DISPUTE ABOUT THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE NOTICE AND THAT'S WHY OUR COURT SYSTEM PROVIDES THE REVENUES THAT IT DOES TO ALLOW IT. TO DEFEND HIM OR HERSELF AND SO. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO FAULT ON BEHALF OF THE TENANT THEY WERE ASSERTING A DEFENSE THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO UNDER THE ELLIS ACTIVE GET. ADEQUATE NOTICE AND SO THAT MAY LEAD ALSO -- TO TO THE ACTION PROCEEDING IN A WAY THAT COULD OTHERWISE SHOP ON THEIR CREDIT REPORTS I THINK. ALTHOUGH IN THE VAST NUMBER OF CASES PEOPLE WILL MOVE OUT THERE ARE INSTANCES IN WHICH THEY ARE LEGITIMATELY DEFENDING THEIR RIGHTS OR HAVE HAD THE ACTION PROCEED WITHOUT -- THEIR ABILITY TO DEFEND BECAUSE THEY HAVE IN FACT MOVED OUT AND THEN THAT COULD SHOW UP ON THE RECORD AS WELL OKAY BUT THE I MEAN THE BILL'S VERY BROADLY WORDED. I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT THAT IS NOT SAYING THAT IT'S GOING TO PROTECT JUST THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHALLENGING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE NOTICE. IT SAYING THAT IT'S ALSO GOING TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO IGNORE THE NOTICE AND NOT MOVE OUT. THE BILLS DESIGNED TO PROTECT THOSE TENANTS WHO. ARE GIVEN AN EVICTION NOTICE BECAUSE THE LANDLORD IS RECLAIMING THE PROPERTY FOR THEIR OWN USE. THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN THESE TENANTS ARE BEING VICTOR PUTS THE LAW ALLOWS THE LANDLORD TO DO. RIGHT BUT THE LAW ALSO SAYS THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND RIGHT NOW THE PROCESS IS CALLED. EVICTION NOT NONE OF THAT'S WHERE WE'RE DISAGREEING BECAUSE WELL I MEAN IT. THE LANDLORD PROVIDES NOTICE. AND UNDER THE LAW THE TENANT HAS TO VACATE WITHIN THE NOTICE PERIOD IS OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO VACATE. IF THEY REFUSED TO VACATE. THEN THE LANDLORD FILES AND FICTION NOTICE UNDER THE ELLIS ACT AND THAT FALLS UNDER THE CATEGORY FOR BILL. I MEAN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO. HAVE -- YOU KNOW THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN BEING FORCED OUT IN AND I'M I'M SURE OUR HEARTS ARE WITH WITH THOSE PEOPLE. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE REFUSED TO LEAVE. I IT LOOKS I MISUNDERSTAND WELL THERE ARE A LOT OF INSTANCES WHERE. INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE -- THE TENANTS MAY WISH TO BE -- YOU MAY BELIEVE THAT THE L. SECTION -- EVICTION IS OR THE REMOVAL WHATEVER YOU CALL IT -- GUN. TO THE NOTICES INSUFFICIENT THEY KNOW THEY'RE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE. INCORRECTLY EVERYTHING ELSE AND THEY HAVE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS -- THERE'S A MENTIONED IN THE LETTER THAT WOULD WAS RECEIVED THAT. IS OVER IT'S CAN BE A YEAR'S NOTICE BUT THEN THAT'S ONLY LIMITED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. IS THAT THE GREATER NUMBER OF NOTICES ARE A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY LEFT LESSENED THE LEGAL UNIVERSE. AND THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT NOW WITH IT.ONE THING THAT YOU HAVE IS THAT IF YOU SEEK TO DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS AS A TENANT. TO SAY THAT THE NOTICES INSUFFICIENT OR THEIR OTHER. OF FAILINGS IN THE EFFORTS TO HAVE YOU REMOVED AND THE ELLIS ACT WHATEVER THAT IF YOU DO THAT WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE REX KING. BEING IN AN EVICTION SITUATION AND THEREFORE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING HOUSING DOWN THE LINE. ARE GOING TO BE -- CERTAINLY ARE GOING TO BE HURT WHAT SUBSTANTIAL JUST TO BE CLEAR IF THE BILL HAD BEEN WORDED. SO THAT IF YOU CHALLENGED AND ALICE ACT. EVICTION AND PREVAILED THAT THE COURT RECORD WOULD SEAL. I THINK -- WE WOULD BE A 100%. BEHIND YOU BUT IT'S NOT WORTH IT THAT WAY IT'S WORDED TO PROTECT EVERYBODY THAT'S BEEN CONVICTED. UNDER THE ELLIS ACT EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW THEY HAD TO VACATE REFUSED TO VACATE DIDN'T HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON FOR REVIEWS THAT REFUSAL. AND THE LANDLORD HAD WAS FORCED TO THAT THE SO I MEAN THAT THAT THAT'S WHY I MEAN UNFORTUNATE OFTEN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION -- IF IF IT HAD BEEN WORDED MORE NARROWLY THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BUT SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THOSE THAT ARE PRESENT. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. STEVE I'LL JUST MAKE A FEW COMMENTS THE YELLOW SECT IN MANY COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE INCLUDING MY OWN. HAS BEEN USED. TO EFFECT HUNDREDS OF NOT THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS -- AND IN MANY INSTANCES THE ELLIS ACT HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE A PRETEXT FOR MOVING FOLKS OUT WITH CERTAIN OWNERS WHO THEN. OUR RENT OUT APARTMENTS -- AFTER NOT HAVING -- MOVE FOR WITH WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DONE ON THE ELLIS ACT. AND IN OTHER INSTANCES -- IT I DON'T THINK ANYONE HERE WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF YOU'VE LIVED IN YOUR HOME FOR DECADES -- YOU SHOULD DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO TRY TO STAY TO LIVE IN YOUR HOME WHEN THE ALTERNATIVE IS BEING FORCED OUT ON THE STREET AND THAT'S AGAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE FIND A LOT OF THESE FAMILIES AND AND SO. THE CHOICE THAT. I THINK THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO ADDRESSES. FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO EXERCISE ALL OF THE LEGAL RIGHT TO HAVE -- BUT BUT IN THIS CASE THEY'RE FORCED -- TO POTENTIALLY RISK HAVING THEIR NAME BE PUT ON A COMMERCIAL BLACKLIST THAT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM BEING A WELL CONSIDERED BY FUTURE LANDLORDS FOR UP TO SEVEN YEARS AND AND AND I THINK THE IDEA THAT. GIVEN THAT THE STARTED -- BECAUSE OF AN ADDICTION THAT DID NOT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING THAT WAS AT THE FAULT OF THE TENANT -- WE SHOULD NOT FORCE THEM TO THIS CHOICE OF WHETHER TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS OR BE PLACED ON A BLACKLIST FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS AND BECAUSE OF THAT -- I WILL ABSOLUTELY BE SUPPORTING THIS AND HAVE BEEN WITH US BEFORE THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION SIR SECOND. AND A SECOND. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. FEATURED OR CAN I JUST CAN I CLARIFY AND THE CAT CATEGORIES AS INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU SAID THAT THIS WOULD APPLY TO SO YOU THINK YOU SAID THAT. THERE ARE THE PEOPLE IN STROBEL EVERNOTE HE NOTED I WHO. REFUSED TO LEAVE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN A LEGITIMATE DISPUTE ABOUT THE EVICTION PROCEEDINGS. SOUND LIKE YOU SAID THERE IS A THIRD CATEGORY OF INDIVIDUAL WHO ACTUALLY HAVE LEFT. WHEN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BUT ARE STILL BEING FALSELY LISTED AS BEING AFFECTED WITH THE DATA THAT IS A POSSIBLE OUTCOME YEAH I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE SEEN INSTANCES IN WHICH AND? MR TO DID A BILL COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TO TRY. TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT WE WERE SEEING. INSTANCES IN WHICH THE ACTION IS FILED THEN THE TENANT. MOVED OUT OR MAYBE THEY MOVE OUT SIMULTANEOUS DETECTION BEING FILED THEY MAY NEVER GET NOTICE OF THE ACTION THEY GET A DEFAULT AND THAT DEFAULT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE LANDLORD TO GET AN ORDER OF POSSESSION. AND THEN THAT WOULD. WOULD THEN BE REFLECTED ON THE TENANTS CREDIT REPORT AND SO I THINK. THERE IS THAT THAT IS A POSSIBLE OUTCOME THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME IS YOU -- REITERATING OF A PERSON IS DEFENDING THEMSELVES AND I THINK JUST THE OTHER POINT THAT I FAILED TO MAKE THERE WAS. IF YOU HAVE. THE COURT THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE LANDLORD CAN GET POSSESSION BACK THERE THEY CAN FILE THEIR EVICTION ACTION THEY CAN PROCEED TO A JUDGMENT QUESTION IS WHETHER IT REFLECTS ON THE TENANTS. CREDIT WORTHINESS AND IN THIS INSTANCE BECAUSE AS MR SHE WAS DISCUSSING AND THE AUTHORS POINTED OUT. A THERE'S REALLY NO FAULTS HERE MAYBE THERE WAS A DISPUTE MAYBE THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY SECURING OTHER HOUSING BUT IT REALLY CAN REFLECT ON THEM AS A TENANT. THAT THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE KIND OF THING THAT WE SHOULD PUT ON THE TENNIS GREAT REPORT FOR SEVEN YEARS AND THAT'S I THINK THE CENTRAL PREMISE BEHIND THIS BILL. RIGHT NOW I DO I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND YES WHEN IT COMES IN THE BUSINESS WORLD THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO HEAR HAVE DATA TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS. BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE THAT DATA IS FLAWED. AND THE IMPLICATIONS AND THE AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT DATA BEING FIRED. ON SOMEONE'S CREDIT REPORT FOR SEVEN YEARS IS. MEANS ABSOLUTELY CATASTROPHIC AND SO TO ME I THINK. YEAH THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE I'M GONNA. YOU'RE ON THE SIDE OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT HI. RUNNING SOMEONE'S LIFE -- PERMANENTLY BECAUSE OF A POTENTIALLY FIVE DATA. I AND SOME HAVE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANKS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THIS ALL IN. YES I WAS GOING TO I WAS KIND OF FOLLOW ALONG THE SAME LINES AT THE THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS ARE ARE -- NOTED AND AS I WAS REFLECTING ON THE QUESTION BACK AND FORTH I WAS ALSO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF AFTER. THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS IF THEY STAY IN THE UNIT THAT THAT SORT OF SPARKS AND NEED TO TAKE SOME TYPE OF ACTION BUT I BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CLARITY OF WHAT. THE CHALLENGE WOULD REPRESENT THAT THEY'RE STILL BLACKLISTED FOR SEVEN YEARS AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND THAT. SEEMS TO BE A BIT EXCESSIVE IN TERMS OF THEIR TRYING TO CHALLENGE OR BETTER CLARIFY -- THE POSITION AND I GUESS ALL OF THESE SITUATIONS WE KNOW THERE ARE -- PROPERTY OWNERS OUT THERE WHO -- CAN USE THESE. THEY ALL SUCK AND OTHER TOOLS TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE WHO MAY NOT OR MAY BE USING IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO -- NOTED SO -- I% THINK UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INTENT OF TRYING TO PROTECT -- FOLKS WHO ARE IN A SITUATION. BY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN -- TO SAFEGUARD THEM FROM BEING PUT IN JEOPARDY -- WITH THEIR CREDIT -- BEING PUT. ON A SEVEN YEAR -- STATUS I THINK THAT. IT'S WORTHY OF THE SUPPORT I I'D LIKE TO HAVE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A WAY TO MAYBE EVEN. FINE TUNE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE -- WITH SOME TYPE OF AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ADDRESS. WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS RAISED SO THAT THERE'S? ABOUT THAT LIGHT SHINING THROUGH HERE THAT IT COULD BE SEALED A LITTLE TIGHTER -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD BE AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT -- BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE THERE TO CONTINUE TO BE CONVERSATION AND AND THAT PROCESS IF THERE'S A WAY. TO SORT OF FINE TUNE A LITTLE BIT MORE I CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE THAT BUT AS IT'S WRITTEN TODAY AND WITHOUT HAVING ANY. OF SUGGESTED. ALTERNATIVE I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT [inaudible] TWO OTHERS. RIGHT THIS CALL NOT GONNA BE MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY PROPOSED AMENDMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION BUT BASED ON THE CONVERSATION HAD HEARING COMMITTEE I AM CERTAINLY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO TIGHTEN THE LANGUAGE SO THAT IT IS EXPLICIT AND AND YOU WHO IT IS -- TRYING TO PROTECT -- THE OPPOSITION IS IS CORRECT IN MANY INSTANCES THESE LANDLORDS ARE MOM AND POP LANDLORDS ON THAT HAVE VERY SMALL NUMBERS OF UNITS AND THEIR RELOCATION ASSISTANT COSTS ARE EXORBITANT. YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING TO RECLAIM PROPERTY THROUGH NO AT YOU KNOW IN A DATING ATTENDANT TO NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN IT IS. THEIR INCREDIBLE FINANCIAL STRAIN OFTEN TIMES THAT THEY'RE DOING SO AND SO WE ARE LOOKING TO FIND WAYS TO BOTH PROTECT THEM BUT ALSO TO PROTECT THE TENANTS. WHO WILL NOW HAVE TO LOOK YOU KNOW FOR OTHER -- SPACES TO RENT AND SHOULDN'T BE BLACKLISTED OR BLACKBALLED BECAUSE THEY WERE EVICTED THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN -- WITH THIS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE ARE GALLAGHER. ALGOR DON'T NO CHILD. TO TWO ARKANSAS IS HOLDEN. HOLDEN I CHOLERA. CALLER I.

YOU MUST CALL IT WHAT IT IS THAT WE MUST ACT. ACCORDINGLY SEVENTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS READ THE PLACE THEY CALL HOME. OUR FAMILIES AND NEIGHBORS ARE FACING SKYROCKETING RENTS AND MANY FACE EVICTIONS THAT FORCE THEM FROM THEIR HOMES. I REPRESENT ONE OF THE HARDEST CITIES OAKLAND CALIFORNIA. BUT OAKLAND IS NOT ALONE IN THIS CRISIS ALL OVER CALIFORNIA DISPLACEMENT DUE TO LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS CHANGING THE VERY FACE OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT MANY PEOPLE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD. TO LIVE WHERE THEY GREW UP. ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK. OR IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY LOVE. A B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE WILL ADDRESS WRONG PHONE AND ON JUSTIFICATIONS IT WILL HELP TO KEEP MORE FAMILIES. IN THEIR HOMES. UNDER A BE FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE TENANTS WOULD BE PROTECTED FROM DISCRIMINATORY RETALIATORY. OR ARBITRARY EVICTIONS LANDLORDS WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO EVICT. TENANTS FOR FAIR REASONS FOR JUST REASONS FOR EXAMPLE IF THE BREACH THAT LEASES REFUSED TO PAY RENT. OR BREAK LAWS RELATED TO THEIR TENANCY. LAST WEEK THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE AND HOUSING PAST AB. FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO BY SOME REMEMBER. TO MR CHOOSE RENT STABILIZATION ANTI GOUGING BILL GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THIS BILL. IF A TENANT IS PROTECTED FROM RENT GOUGING BUT CAN BE EVICTED FOR ANY REASON. OR FOR TEN IT CAN ONLY BE EVICTED FOR FAIR AND JUST REASONS BUT CAN BE ECONOMICALLY AFFECTED BY AN EXCESSIVE RENT INCREASE. THEY ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECTED. TENNIS NEEDS NEED AND DESERVE BOTH ANTI RENT GOUGING AND JUST BECAUSE PROTECTIONS. TODAY. RENTERS CAN BE EVICTED WITHOUT ANY INDICATION AS TO WHY. THIS LEAVES SO MANY OF CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA SEVENTY MILLION TENANTS WONDERING. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I LOSE MY HOME? WHERE WILL I GO? HOW WILL I FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING? HOW WILL I TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY? OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS NOT LIMITED TO JUST THE SUPPLY PROBLEM. WE DO NEED MORE SUPPLY AND I HAVE AND I DO SUPPORT BUILDING MORE UNITS ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE UNITS. BUT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT A HOUSING CRISIS HOLISTICALLY. AND USE EVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO BRING RELIEF TO AS MANY CALIFORNIANS. AS POSSIBLE. WE CAN AND WE SHOULD STIMULATE SUPPLY AND PROTECT OUR TENANTS. THESE THESE APPROACHES ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. A B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE SOLUTION TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS.

FOR THE SIMPLE REASON TO REMOVE ME SO THAT A HIGHER INCOME RESIDENT COULD MOVE IN WHO COULD PAY MORE OR EVEN FOR DISCRIMINATORY PURPOSES. THIS ADDICTION NOTICE GIVEN AFTER MY SIXTEEN YEARS THERE. I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE SEVERAL OTHER TENANTS IN MY BUILDING LONG TERM TENANTS WERE ALSO SERVE NO BECAUSE OF ACTIONS AFTER YEARS OF LIVING IN THEIR HOMES. NO REASON GIVEN WE JUST KNEW WE HAD TO LEAVE. I FELT LIKE GIVING UP HONESTLY. I'VE LIVED THERE LONGER THAN I WOULD ANYWHERE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I AM DISABLED IT IS MY SANCTUARY AND WITHOUT IT I FEAR I WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD ON TO MY PRECARIOUS HEALTH. FORTUNATELY FOR ME AFTER USING THE THREAT OF LEGAL ACTION UNDER THE PROMISE OF RETALIATION. THE OWNERS DECIDED TO RETRACT THE NO CAUSE OF ACTION. HOWEVER IT DID NOT REPLACE THE SEVERAL MONTHS OF ANGUISH AND STRESS I FELT DURING THOSE DAYS WONDERING IF I COULD STAY AT MY HOME. AND I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF OTHER TENANTS IN THE STATE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE WILL POWER ACCESS YOUR INFORMATION TO ADDRESS SUCH ATROCIOUS ACTIONS. ALTHOUGH THAT OBJECTION WAS ADDRESSED AS SOON EXPERIENCE A NOTICE OF RENT INCREASE THAT WOULD MORE THAN DOUBLE MY RENT. I AM NOW BEING FORCED TO LOOK FOR NEW HOUSING AND MOVE OUT BY THE END OF JULY BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD THE NEW ROUND. AND WITH A NEWLY ISSUED SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER FINDING A PLACE IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. I AM HERE TO SUPPORT A BE FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE AND JUST BECAUSE OF ACTION PROTECTIONS BUT TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT. THAT IT WILL TAKE MULTIPLE AND COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS TO FIX OUR HOUSING CRISIS SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS I'M JUST NOW BECAUSE OF ACTIONS IN ADDITION TO SKYROCKETING RENTS THEY MUST GO TOGETHER. IN REDWOOD CITY WE HAVE LITTLE TO NO REAL RENTER PROTECTIONS AND ABSOLUTELY NO RENT STABILIZATION POLICY WE NEED STRONG AND REAL PROTECTIONS NOW. PROTECTIONS LIKE THOSE IN A B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE AND AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH PROTECTS TENNIS FROM ADDICTION WITHOUT REASON. AND PREVENT UNCONSCIONABLE RENT HIKES LIKE THE ONE I JUST EXPERIENCED. LAST THURSDAY THE GOVERNOR STATED IN REMARKS THAT VULNERABLE RESIDENTS SENIORS FAMILIES WITH SMALL CHILDREN AND PEOPLE ON A FIXED INCOME. SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR OF ADDICTION BUT THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ARE HOUSING AND SECURE FACING EVICTION AND WONDERING IF THEY WILL BE HOMELESS THE NEXT TIME THEY COMPLAIN OR GET SERVED A RATE HIKE. WE MUST PROTECT OUR PEOPLE PLEASE SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN ANYONE ABOUT TO PROTECT US TO PROTECT ME TODAY. THE TIME IS NOW MILLIONS OF TENANTS ARE DEPENDING ON YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HOLD ON HOLD ON YOU GUYS WERE VERY WELL BEHAVED. EARLIER ON BUT I DO WE WE CANNOT HAVE. WE WE CANNOT HAVE OUTBURSTS IF THE YOU HAD READ EARLIER IF YOU WANT TO EXPRESS SUPPORT. THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE BUT NO OUTBURSTS PLEASE NO TALKING OVER OTHER WITNESSES [inaudible] PLEASE NO. COMMENTING FROM THE AUDIENCE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE CAN HEAR AND LISTEN TO EVERY WITNESS THAT'S TALKING TODAY SO YOU YOU'VE DONE GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT NEXT WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING TERM MEMBERS I'M SUCH A HARD TIME WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PROUD TO CO SPONSOR A BE. FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE ARBITRARY AFFECTIONS AND PROTECT TENANTS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION BY REQUIRING LANDLORDS TO STATE IT THE REASON BEFORE EVICTING TENANTS FROM THEIR HOMES. THE BILL LET'S SETTLE ALLOWABLE REASONS FOR EVICTION INTO CATEGORIES OUT FAULT AND NO FAULT EVICTIONS. OUT FAULT OF ACTIONS INCLUDE THOSE BASED ON TEN AND CONDUCT SUCH AS NON PAYMENT OF RENT VIOLATION OF THE LEASE OR DISTURBING NEIGHBORS. AND NO FAULT EVICTIONS INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE ON OUR MOVE AND DEMOLITION OR RENOVATION -- FOR NO FAULT EVICTIONS THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF RELOCATION ASSISTANCE TO TENANTS AND RECOGNITION OF THE HARDSHIP IMPOSE ONE ONCE FORCE FROM YOUR HOME. THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT NOVEL THEY HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND IN CONNECTION WITH ALMOST EVERY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING PROGRAM FOR DECADES AND OF LANDLORDS BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE IN PROPERTIES. OR TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO WITH THEIR PROPERTIES SUCH AS UNDER THE ALLIS ACT -- IT'S ALSO A CRITICAL BELT TO ENSURING THAT OUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS SKYROCKETING RENTS AND PRICE GOUGING ARE EFFECTIVE. BY PREVENTING LANDLORDS FROM ESSENTIALLY ACCESSING A LOOPHOLE WHEREBY THEY COULD EFFECT A TENANT FOR NO REASON AND THEN RAISE THE RENT. FOR THE NEXT TOWN AND IN VIOLATION OF OUR EFFORTS AROUND AROUND PRICE GOUGING SO -- THIS BILL SIMPLY STATES THAT OF LANDMARKS DON'T HAVE A VALID REASON TO EVICT A TENANT THEY SHOULDN'T FORCE THAT TENET FROM THEIR HOME AND WE RESPECTFULLY OR DRIVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHERS AND SUPPORTS. YOU WANNA COME INDICATE SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS -- IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS OPPOSES AB. FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE WHICH PROHIBITS A RENTAL PROPERTY UNDER FROM TERMINATING A LEASE WITHOUT JUST CAUSE. HOWEVER BASED ON CONVERSATIONS HE OURS HAD WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE SPONSORS AND STAFF SEE OUR WILL BE DISCUSSING MAYBE FOURTEEN EIGHTY WANTED ITS UPCOMING BUSINESS MEETINGS LATER THIS WEEK. DURING THIS MEETING C. R. WILL EVALUATE THE BILL AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INPUT ON THE MEASURE. SEE OUR LOOKS FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THE LEGISLATURES OF HOLES IT EXPLORES VARIOUS PUBLIC POLICY OPTIONS THAT SEEK TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU TEXAS WITH. BUT CHECK -- TWENTY WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION MASS SPLIT MY TIME WITH MY IN HOUSE COUNSEL TO GIVE A PERSPECTIVE A MECHANICS MY TIME FOR THAT OKAY UP IT'S NOT YOUR TIME I'LL START. MY TIME RIGHT -- BUT ALL RIGHT I WILL I WILL DO THAT IN THIS CASE -- YOU ABOUT A MINUTE HALF CATCH. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY SAYING WE'RE NOT HERE TO DEFEND BAD ACTING OWNERS AND THEIR ACTIONS -- OUT ALSO BEGIN BY SAYING THAT DISCRIMINATORY AND RESULTS WERE AFFECTIONS ARE ILLEGAL. UNDER CURRENT LAW TODAY. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE FEAR THAT THIS BILL WOULD NOT PROVIDE THE PERFECT -- PROTECTIONS AS INTENDED -- AN EFFECT OF SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE POLICIES COULD BE. COULD BE INCREASED RENTS NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S ACTION IS RIGHT. BUT WE KNOW THAT JUST BECAUSE POLICIES STARTED RECTAL JURISDICTIONS AS A WAY TO ENSURE OWNERS WILL NOT. GET AROUND LOCAL RENTAL WALLS. ADDITIONALLY IN PROPERTIES SUBS JUST BECAUSE OWNERS STRUGGLE TO REMOVE BAD ACTING TENETS SELLING DRUGS ON THE PRINCE'S. OWNERS MUST RELY ON THIRD PARTY WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN COURT AND NEIGHBORING TENNIS OFFICE DO NOT WANT TO PUT THEMSELVES IN THAT SITUATION. WELL TODAY IN ORDER TO SERVE A THIRTY OR SIXTY DAY NOTICE TO TERMINATE THIS BAD ACTING TENET. UNDER AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY ONE ON THIS WILL NOT BE AND WOULD BE UNABLE TO DO SO UNLESS NEIGHBORS ARE WILLING TO TEST BY WHICH MOST TENNIS WILL NOT AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN OVER. TO GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS MY NAME IS NOW UNDER GREAT WALL I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH C. EIGHT BEFORE JOINING CA I WAS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE. SPECIALIZING IN LANDLORD TENANT LAW I HAD TONS OF CASES WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY ON THE PROPERTY AND OWNERS ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE BURDEN OF PROOF TO PREVAIL IN A JUST CAUSE LAWSUIT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO RELY ON THIRD WHITE. PARTY WITNESSES THESE ARE THE WITNESSES THAT ARE THE GOOD TENANTS ON THE PROPERTY GOOD TENANTS ARE AFRAID AND DO NOT WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN LAWSUITS. PRESIDENTS MAY CALL THE POLICE BUT DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF NUISANCE ON THE PROPERTY POLICE OFTEN SAY THAT THIS IS A CIVIL MATTER AND THAT THE LANDLORD WILL NEED TO VIC THE TENET. SO WITHOUT ACTUAL PROOF OR WITNESSES WILLING TO TESTIFY A LAND OWNER PREVAILING IN IT JUST BECAUSE LAWSUIT IS PRETTY SLIM WITHOUT THE USE OF AN ATTORNEY AND AN ATTORNEY WILL NOT FILE A CASE WHERE. THERE IS NO PROOF AND SO OWNERS WILL BE ASKED TO WAIT AND BUILD THEIR CASE AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW THESE TYPES OF BAD TENANTS ON THE PROPERTY. LEADING GOOD TENANTS WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER WALL GOOD TENANTS SOME OF THEM WHO CAN AFFORD IT MAY VACATE OTHERS WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN UNSAFE COMMUNITIES. A TYPICAL FICTION CASE ONCE IT'S FILED TAKE SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS AND THAT'S WHEN THERE ISN'T A REQUEST FOR A JURY TRIAL THIS COSTS A MOM AND POP OWNER. SIX YOU KNOW FOR FIVE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEES -- LANDLORDS ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF THE VICTIM TENETS SO JUST THIS JUST CAUSES AND PROVIDE. TEXANS FOR THESE LOW INCOME RESIDENTS BUT INCREASES THE COST AND IT REDUCES THE SAFETY OF THESE GOOD RESIDENTS ON THESE PROPERTIES WILL BE FORCED TO LIVE IN THESE UNSAFE COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RUN KINGSTON REPRESENTING THE SAME THREE REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS. EACH BE RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION APARTMENT ASSOCIATION -- OF CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CITIES AND ALSO ORANGE COUNTY. I'M TERMINATIONS ARE. SOLELY BASED ON ONE ISSUE THAT THIS BILL TURNS ON CONDUCT OF THE TENANT. CONDUCTIVITY TENANT. YOU HAVE TO REMEDY SET LAW TODAY YOU CAN EITHER PURSUE AN INFECTION OR TERMINATION. IF THE CONTACT IS BASED ON COMPLAINTS BY OTHER TENANTS. NO WAYS -- PLAYING A STEREO FOR EXAMPLE VERY VERY LOUD THREATENING BEHAVIOR THE WE WOULD THINK UNDER MISTER BOTCHES BILL THAT THE EASY REMEDY IS TO AFFECT IT'S NOT. KNOW WHETHER TEN IT WILL APPEAR IN COURT TO SUBSTANTIATE THE CLAIM -- THAT THEY THAT THEY ARE FACING AND HAVE TALKED -- TO WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER NOBODY ELSE SO WE ARE NOW PLACED IN A QUANDARY WITH THIS BILL. AND THE ISSUE THAT THIS BILL TURNS ON IS. HOW DO WE [inaudible] I HAVE THAT TENANT MOVE ON THAT IS CAUSING THE MASSIVE DISTURBANCE OF OTHER TENANTS. THE OVERALL QUESTION IS WHO IS THIS BILL TRYING TO PROTECT THE OTHER. OTHER ALL THE OTHER TENANTS THAT ARE HAPPY WHERE THEY ARE BUT THEY'RE HAVING ONE PROBLEM WITH -- ONE OF THE TENETS. WAR WE PROTECTING THE TENET THAT HAS. TREMENDOUS BAD BEHAVIOR AND WE CAN'T SUBSTANTIATE. THE CLAIM. AND THEN TO THE LAST WITNESS IF WE CAN'T SUBSTANTIATE THE CLAIM WE ARE IN PANDORA'S BOX AND THIS BILL PUTS US IN THERE AND KEEPS US. IN THERE FOR GOOD -- AND WITH THAT WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION OF COURSE GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS KATE BELL CAPITAL ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION. WE HAVE OVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND MEMBERS AND HALF MILLION FROM THE STATE AND WE OPPOSE BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE CORRECT AS WELL THANK YOU. JENNIFER TOWN HELL WITH ERIN READING ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. STEVE CARLSON FOR THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF GREATER LOS ANGELES IN THE SANTA BARBARA RENTAL PROPERTY ASSOCIATION OF POST. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SINA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RIGHT SEEING NONE [inaudible] MISTER GALLAGHER [inaudible] MISTER GALLAGHER [inaudible] SO -- LOOK THE REASON WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL AT THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT REASONS BUT I THINK THE MOST. FUNDAMENTAL IS THAT I THINK IT TURNS THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY ON IT SAID AND AND I'M I'M I BELIEVE FUNDAMENTALLY -- THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS IS THE THING THAT THAT MAXIMIZES THE BENEFITS TO SOCIETY -- NO ONE MORE THAN THAN THAN AN OWNER OF LAND HIS MADE THE INVESTMENT IN THAT LAND. IS MORE VESTED IN ENSURING THE LONG TERM -- PRODUCTIVITY AND BENEFITS. BENEFITS OF THAT PROPERTY -- AND I THINK HISTORY IS JUST SHOWING THAT VERY CLEARLY -- AND WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO DO WITH THESE TYPES OF LAWS IS. BEND IT MORE IN FAVOR OF NO NOW THE TENET IS IS THE ONE THAT'S IN CONTROL. OF THE PROPERTY -- NOW. OF COURSE THE TENANT WHO IS LIVING IN A AN APARTMENT HAS A VERY MUCH AN INTEREST -- IN THAT PROPERTY -- BUT SO LONG AS THAT TEN AND I THINK AGAIN THE THE RECORD IS SEAN THIS VERY CLEARLY AND SO LONG AS THAT TENANT. IS PAYING RENT AND IS KEEPING UP THAT PROPERTY AS IN KEEPING UP THEIR OBLIGATIONS. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PRIVATE INTERESTS ANY VICTIM THAT PERSON. WHATSOEVER BECAUSE THAT'S EXOTIC ZACH LEE WHAT. IS GONNA KEEP THAT PROPERTY PRODUCTIVE AND BENEFICIAL FOR THAT LANDLORD LONG TERM. I DON'T SAY THIS IN A VACUUM. I'M A TENANT. I'M A TENANT FARMER. AND WE HAVE FORMED THIS THE SAME PROPERTY FOR A LANDLORD FOR FORTY PLUS YEARS NOW -- WE HAVEN'T BEEN KICKED OFF LINE I'M SURE THERE'S OTHERS WHO COULD OFFER MORE MONEY. FOR THAT PROPERTY BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE'VE MADE THE PROPERTY PRODUCTIVE AND LONG TERM THAT LANDLORD IS SEEN THE BENEFIT. BUT THEY HAVE THE FULL RIGHT TO DO SO IF OUR LEASE IS UP. YOU KNOW THEY COULD MAKE THAT DECISION TO GO HEY THIS IS MY PRIVATE PROPERTY AND AND AND ULTIMATELY. THAT IS THE THING THAT WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO LONG TERM PRODUCTIVITY. OF THAT AND AND I THINK THE SAME THING IS IS IS CLEAR HERE. HERE'S THE OTHER THING IT DOES TO ME. IS I THINK WITH THE MORE WE GO DOWN THIS ROAD WITH THESE LAWS IT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES MORE. SLUM LORD TYPE ACTIVITY. WHO'S GOING TO COME IN AND MAKE THE INVESTMENT ON A PROPERTY THAT HAS BECOME DEBILITATED IT'S FULL OF COCKROACHES THAT HAS. IN UNINHABITABLE -- CONDITIONS IF THEY WON'T THEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACTUALLY UPGRADE THAT PROPERTY. DEATH TO DO ELECTIONS TO CLEAN IT UP AND AND AND BRING YOU BRING IT UP TO STANDARD AND THEN WE OFFER IT TO PEOPLE. REBEL WHO'S GONNA MAKE THAT IF THEY CAN'T FULLY CONTROL. THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY WHEN THEY COME IN TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT. TO MAKE IT BETTER -- YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT IS VERY OFTEN THE CASES WE HAVE INVESTORS WERE WILLING TO GO INTO -- PROPERTIES THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO DISREPAIR. MAKE THAT INVESTMENT WITH ALL THE RULES AND RESTRICTIONS THAT WE ARE NOW PUTTING ON LANDLORDS. AND THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT. THERE'S GONNA BE LESS INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO DO SO AND TO ME THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE -- HIM THEY MIGHT BE RENT CONTROLLED. THEY MIGHT MAYBE WE IMPLEMENT JUST BECAUSE BUT THEY'RE STILL GONNA BE SLUMS AND THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE BECAUSE NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE THAT INVESTMENT TO MAKE THEM BETTER -- SO I WOULD THINK IT'S AN OVERALL BEST INTERESTS LONG TERM OF OF INCREASING THE QUALITY OF OUR HOUSING. TO ENSURE THAT LANDLORDS HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO WITH THEIR PROPERTY. AS THEY SEE FIT -- YOU KNOW IT OTHERWISE I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A DISINCENTIVE -- AND THEN I THINK YOU KNOW FINALLY THE REAL REASON THAT WE HAVE MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS AS WE HAVE. AS WE ALL KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS MANY TIMES BUT WE WE DON'T REALLY DO MUCH ABOUT IT. IS WE HAVE A HOUSING SUPPLY PROBLEM. THERE IS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF HOUSING. THERE'S NOT A LOT THERE'S NO ROOM THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM TO GO ANYWHERE THERE'S NOT COMPETITION. SO WHEN THERE ARE SLAMMED RENT CONTROLLED MAYBE THE RENT CONTROLLED SLUMS WHERE ELSE YOU GONNA GO. RIGHT -- WHEN YOU GET EVICTED BECAUSE THERE ISN'T SUPPLY AND WE CONTINUE TO PUT LAWS IN PLACE THE GREATEST ENEMY? OF THE TENANTS TODAY IS MORE LAW. IN MY OPINION ACTUALLY. WE'VE WE'VE CREATED MORE MORE LAWS THE BIGGEST ONE NICK DID THAT KEEPS MANY PROJECTS -- MOVING FOR THE SEQUEL WE ALL KNOW THAT. AND EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT CALIFORNIA BARMAN EQUALITY ACT STOPS GOOD PROJECTS FROM GOING FORWARD AND ALL OF OUR URBAN AREAS -- NIMBY ISM. STOPS GOOD PROJECTS FROM GOING FORWARD IN ALL THESE AREAS AND THEY USE THE LAW. DIFFERENT LAWS ARE PUT IN PLACE THE ABUSE IT. TO STOP THOSE PROJECTS FROM GOING AND SO WE DON'T GET THE LOW INCOME. AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT WE COULD GET IN MANY AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE BOUNCING BODY CHANGING SEQUEL. EXCEPT FOR A FEW PEOPLE. AND MY AND THE ONLY TIMES THAT WE DO DO IT SEEMS TO BE FOR STADIUMS AND ARENAS. BUT WE DON'T WE'RE NOT REALLY DOING THAT YOU KNOW -- TO ENSURE THAT MORE HOUSING COMES ONLINE THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM. THAT IS WHY HOUSING AND RENTS ARE SO HIGH. AS WHY AT THE PRICE TO BUY YOUR FIRST HOUSE IS SO HIGH. IN THESE TYPES OF BILLS DON'T DO ANYTHING TO GET AT THE HEART. OF THAT ISSUE -- SO FOR ME I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE REAL FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE ESTABLISHING A DISINCENTIVE IS THAT LONG TERM. IS GOING TO LEAD -- TO LESS QUALITY HOUSING FOR ALL. THIS IS TRUE. LET ME START BY -- RESPOND TO A FEW POINTS OUT THAT I WASN'T GONNA RAISE BUT I THINK THE SUGGESTION OF THAT IF YOU ARE A GOOD TENANT THERE'S NO REASON TO RAISE THE RENT. HAS BEEN PROVEN WRONG. HAS BEEN PROVEN WRONG MILLIONS OF TIMES IN RECENT YEARS RENTS HAVE BEEN RAISED. ON THE GOOD PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. DURING THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY IN THE PAST TEN YEARS ALONE THE MEDIAN RENTING CALIFORNIA'S BEEN INCREASED BY OVER A THIRD WHILE MEDIAN INCOME HAS REMAINED FLAT. AND AT THIS TIME OVER HALF OF ALL RENTERS OVER 80% OF LOW INCOME RENTERS THEIR RENT BURDEN WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE PAYING OVER A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME TOWARDS RENT -- AT THIS TIME THERE CALIFORNIA PAIN FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS MORE FOR HOUSING. AND THEY CAN AFFORD IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PROBLEM THAT I THINK -- WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE MEALS RESPONDED THE SUGGESTION THAT WE CAN BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS. IT'S THE ESTIMATE IS CALIFORNIA'S THREE AND A HALF MILLION UNITS BEHIND WHERE WE NEED TO BE. IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY WILL TELL YOU. THAT IF WE ENTITLE THREE AND A HALF MILLION UNITS OF HOUSING TO DAY. IT WILL TAKE US YEARS OF NOT DECADES TO BUILD. AND YET WE HAVE MILLIONS OF TENANTS WHO ARE ONE TO RENT INCREASE AWAY FROM BEING FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOMES OF DECADES BEING FORCED OUT ON THEIR STREETS FORCED OUT OF OUR STATE. LET ME SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT THIS BILL -- THIS BILL IS CRITICAL WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE -- THAT TO WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THE CRISIS WE'RE ALSO PROTECTING TENANTS -- THIS IS A BILL THAT WORKS HAND IN HAND WITH AN ANTI RANK OUT YOUR BILL THAT I HAVE PROPOSED WHICH WOULD PREVENT RAIN INCREASES ABOVE. CPI PLUS 5% OR ESSENTIALLY 8% A YEAR -- AND AS MR BONTA SAID IT'S IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF THESE BILLS MOVE FORWARD. BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE RANK OUTING PROTECTIONS WITH NO JUST CAUSE PROTECTIONS IF YOU CAN'T RAISE RENTS ABOVE A CERTAIN LEVEL YOU CONVICT THEM FOR ANY REASON BUT IF THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. IF YOU CAN'T VIC SOMEONE FOR ANY REASON BUT YOU CAN CONSTRUCTIVELY EVICTED BY DOUBLING THE RANT. WE'RE BACK IN THE SAME PROBLEM. I WANT TO SAY A FEW THINGS. TO THE INDUSTRY AND I DO KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. WE HAVE HEARD THE INDUSTRY POTENTIALLY REFERENCE THE OREGON BILL THE CPI PLUS SEVEN BILLS A MODEL TO LOOK AT I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT THAT IS A BILL THAT INCLUDES JUST BECAUSE PROTECTIONS AND SO AGAIN. MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN WORK OUR WAY TO A SOLUTION IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS ON THIS -- I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST I'VE HEARD. IT I'VE HEARD SOME OF THE THE THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENTS TO WHY THIS BILL SHOULDN'T MOVE FORWARD AND AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON SPECIFIC CAUSES THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER CAN CONTINUING -- OR ADDING IF THEY'RE AT FAULT CAUSES OR NO FAULT CAUSES THAT THIS BILL IS MISSING I THINK THAT IS A WELCOME DISCUSSION -- I'VE HEARD THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW CURRENT LAW DOESN'T ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THE THE STORY OF THE DRUG DEALING TENET. AND THE CHALLENGES FACING THIRD PARTY WITNESSES AS A FORMER CRIMINAL PROSECUTOR I DO THINK THERE ARE WAYS FOR US TO GET OUT THOSE CASES BUT I THINK THAT IS A LEGITIMATE CONVERSATION. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE -- BUT TAKING A STEP BACK I DON'T THINK THAT'S A REASON TO SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A JUST CAUSE LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT ALL -- IS. WE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF SUCH AN INTENSE CRISIS AND WE NEED SOLUTIONS HERE -- WE'VE HAD MANY CITIES THAT HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED JUST COST PROTECTIONS IT HAS NOT HARMED THE RENTAL MARKET IN THOSE CITIES. AND AND I DO THINK THIS IS A VERY REASONABLE -- SET OF POLICIES AGAIN TO PROTECT -- SEVENTEEN MILLION RENTERS WHO ARE ALL AT RISK AT THIS TIME SO WITH THAT. HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS HOPE WE CAN MOVE THIS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND WILL MAKE THE MOTION THAT WE DO SO THANK YOU IF YOU HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU THIS CAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF MISTER BOND TO AND MR CHEW ON THESE REALLY DIFFICULT ISSUES AND YOU KNOW THE I LIVE AND I REPRESENT. SAN JOSE -- OUR METRO AREA IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKET IN THE NATION AND MY DISTRICT INCLUDES NOT ONLY SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST. PORTIONS OF OF CALIFORNIA -- INCLUDING THE CAPITAL OF THE DOWNTOWN OF SAN JOSE IT ALSO INCLUDES THE LOWEST INCOME AND POOR A CENSUS TRACTS OF SILICON VALLEY AS WELL. I WOULD NEVER REFERRED ANY THE MUSLIMS I GO THERE OFTEN AND THEY'LL GIVE ME A PLEASE NO AUDIBLE RESPONSE AND THEY'RE GREAT FAMILIES THAT LIVE THERE. I WILL SAY THAT ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS IN FACT I WAS WHEN THE INSTIGATORS LAWS ON CITY COUNCIL THE RESPONSIBLE LANDLORD IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE -- STARGAZER INITIATIVE BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF MULTI FAMILY APARTMENT BUILDINGS ARE ON THAT BILL THE OWNERS WERE NOT UP KEEPING THE PROPERTY AND THE FAMILIES IS HARD WORKING FAMILIES. WERE SUBJECTED TO REALLY POOR LIVING CONDITIONS WE LITERALLY HAD TO TAKE -- PROSECUTORIAL ACTION -- IN ORDER TO FORCE THEM TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR PROPERTIES AND TO MAKE IT SAFER. FOR THEIR TENANTS. I MENTION THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE BAD APPLE ARGUMENT IS ALWAYS USED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT JUST BECAUSE THE REALITY IS A LOT OF GOOD APPLES ARE BEING THROWN OUT. BY EITHER -- OF ADDICTION WITHOUT THE NEED FOR CAUSE OR BUT WHAT WHAT AMOUNTS TO ADDICTION BY THEIR DRAMATIC INCREASE OF RENT. WE'RE IN A CRISIS MAYBE NOT I'D BE PART OF THE STATE SEES IT IN THAT SAME WAY THAT I SEE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY. WITH THE NUMBER OF CHRONIC HOMELESS INCREASING WITH FAMILIES THAT CONTACT OUR OFFICE BECAUSE THEY'RE AT THE BRIDGE OF BEING A VICTIM I CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO STOP IT. I'M NOT SAYING LOOK. HI MY FAMILIES LIVE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING I'VE BEEN A RENTER. HOMEOWNER AND UP -- MY AWARE WE HAVE A SON IN POP OR SODA POP LANDLORDS. I GET IT I'M I I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE IS SAYING THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN ABILITY FOR SOMEONE TO PROFIT. BUT TO SUGGEST SOMEHOW THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS SHOULD BE ABOVE ALL THE ONLY THING THAT WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT AND THAT THEY'LL JUST TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN. ALTHOUGH TAKE CARE THE BUT IT WILL THAT WHAT WAS SAID WAS WELL WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT THE BEST VALUE COMES OUT OF THAT PROPERTY YEAH THEY'RE RIGHT. THE BEST VALUE WILL COME OUT OF THAT PROPERTY FOR THAT OWNER. BUT WE HAVE A PUBLIC PLAN IN FACT THIS COUNTRY IS FOUNDED. BY GIVING RIGHTS ONLY TO WHITE PROPERTY OWNERS. AND SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS WE AS LEGISLATORS OF A PUBLIC POLICY. CRISIS ON OUR HANDS BECAUSE OF THE OUT OF CONTROL PROPERTY VALUES HOME CLASS RENTAL. COSTS AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND I AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT EVEN THE OPPOSITION. OF UNDERSTANDS THAT I MEAN I THINK I'VE TALKED TO MANY OF THEM BUT CERTAINLY THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY GET THAT WE'RE IN A CRISIS MODE WE ALL AGREE WE NEED TO BUILD MORE. YOU COME TO SAN JOSE YOU'LL SEE PLENTY OF BUILDING HAPPENING -- AND I'M GONNA KEEP BUILDING AFFORDABLE MARKET RATE YOU NAME IT ALWAYS ENCOURAGE THAT. BUT IN THE MEANTIME -- FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING AND AND AT THE END AND TOO MANY OF THEM ARE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY ONE MEDICAL EMERGENCY AWAY -- FROM BEING HOMELESS AND FAR TOO MANY LIVE IN THEIR CARS OR OR OR IN STABLE RIGHT NOW. AND SO I I THINK THAT THESE ARE TOOLS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CRISIS. AND I I THINK THAT THE THE FEARS -- HAVING AGAIN. BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE'VE HAD TENANTS THAT WERE TROUBLE TENANTS AND YES IT TAKES SOME EFFORT -- MEANT TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES BY THE END OF THE DAY. THE OBLIGATIONS IT SHOULD BE SUCH THAT PEOPLE'S HOMES ARE PROTECTED WHAT THAT THOUGH THE WEATHER THE RENTING OR NOT THAT'S THE HOME. THIS IS NOT TALK MY REVEAL IT WITH RENTING A LOCKER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THIS IS OUR HOME. AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY COGNIZANT OF THAT AND I HAVE PRACTICED THEM OR TENANT LAWS WELL. AND UNDERSTAND HOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS WHEN TENANTS ARE TRYING. TO HAVE SOME SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT EVEN IF THEY HAVE LAWS PROTECTING THEM THE RED THE REALITY IS THAT -- THE DATA THAT THE THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST THEM -- AND FOR THAT REASON I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THE SPONSOR. I THINK JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS A IT IT IT SADDENS ME TO QUITE TENANTS AND PRODUCTIVITY ON THE LANDS WHICH IS CLEARLY AN AGRICULTURAL CONCEPT AND THE ANALOGY IS ESSENTIALLY. ASCRIBING TENDENCY TO HOW WE TREAT CROPS ON THE LAND AND I THINK THAT'S I'M GONNA STRUGGLE WITH THAT WITH THAT ANALOGY AND AND I'LL ALSO. SAY THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT SEEKING A SEQUEL HAS BEEN A KIND OF A WHIPPING BOY WAY FOR LAND USE ISSUES BUT IF YOU LOOK STATISTICALLY. AT HOUSE EQUITIES USE IT IS CLEARLY NOT THE PROBLEM THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE FACE RIGHT NOW. WITH GETTING MORE HOUSING BUILT. IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR ALL THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES ECONOMIC STUDIES THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE SHOWING THIS RIGHT NOW. THAT THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS AND GIVEN THE TERRACE ON STEEL ON THE TERRACE ON CONCRETE AND THE LACK OF A WORK FORCE TO PROVIDE. TO IT TO BE BUILDING THOSE ARE GOING TO THE PLACES THAT CAN AFFORD TO THE PROJECTS HE CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE HIGHEST COST OF CONSTRUCTION. AND THAT'S THESE LARGE COMMERCIAL PROJECTS WHICH BY THE WAY ARE NOT CARING THEIR SHARE OF PROPERTY TAX BURDEN. TO TO REALLY FUN THE LEVEL OF SERVICES AND THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU LOOK AT THE CURRENT STUDIES THAT ARE SHOWING WHAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND NOT HAPPEN WITH RESPECT TO DEVELOPMENT. DON'T EVEN MENTION THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT SO FAR DOWN THE THE LIST WHEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC PRESSURES THAT ARE DRIVING THE KINDS OF PROJECTS WHERE ALL OF THOSE RESOURCES ARE GOING. IT'S NOT GOING TO HOUSING SO EVEN IF WE ARE. PUSHING TO BUILD HOUSING ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE ALL THOSE RESOURCES GOING INTO THAT THE CONSTRUCTION IN THE IN THE COMMERCIAL SIDE A LOT OF THE MEGA CAMPUSES THAT ARE HAPPENING AND AND LARGE DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE GOING ON SO IN HE MEANTIME. WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE TENDENCY IS WHAT WE DO WITH THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK AND PROTECTING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE THAT'S WHAT THIS CONVERSATION IS AN EVEN THAT THE? LANDLORD THAT I'VE TALKED TO IN IT OUT OF MY DISTRICT AND IN ENVIRONS CLOSE [inaudible] REALLY. TALK ABOUT THAT [inaudible] THE CAPS ON RENSE RENT CONTROL HOWEVER THEY GETS FRAMED AND PROTECTION OF TENDENCIES AS GOING HAND IN HAND AND THEY OFTEN DON'T LIKE ONE OR THE OTHER BUT THEY CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CANNOT WE CANNOT HAVE A SYSTEM OF PROTECTING TENDENCIES UNLESS WE HAVE. THE BREADTH OF CONTROLS THAT ARE THERE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES THAT'S WHAT MR TO CHOOSE BILL DOES AND THAT'S WHAT MR GRAYSON'S BILL IS TALKING ABOUT IN THAT AND THAT'S GOING TO COME UP NEXT. SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT YOU BRING IN THIS FORD THIS IS A CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO BE HAVING IN CALIFORNIA. AND PROTECTING THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN HOUSING NOW SO THAT THEY'RE NOT LOSING HOUSING THAT THEY'RE HAVING STABLE AND SECURE HOUSING. AS WE THEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THE HOUSING ACTUALLY BUILT WE HAVE PROBLEMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL GETTING PROJECTS ENTITLED WE'VE GOT ZONING CHALLENGES THAT'S WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS WORKING ON BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. EVEN IF THOSE HAPPEN. THE HOUSING PROJECTS SPECIALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS JUST REALLY CANNOT GET BUILT UNTIL THE LABOR SUPPLY THE MATERIAL SUPPLY TURNS AROUND AND THAT SITUATION CHANGES OTHERWISE ALL THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO. TO COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS FORWARD BUT SINCE YOU'RE HERE AND SINCE MR GRAYSON IS THERE ALSO YOU TOO HAVE VERY SIMILAR BILLS AND I'LL SAY THIS WHEN MR GRACE COMES UP AS WELL. I KNOW YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BRINGING THEM TOGETHER AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT HAPPENS FOR THIS COMMITTEE. I'M NOT MAKING THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE COMBINE THE TWO BILLS BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT THAT I'M HOPING YOU'RE GOING TO BE HEADING IN TO BRING THESE BILLS TOGETHER SO THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE FLOOR. GETS TO THE OTHER HOUSE THAT WE'RE MOVING A VEHICLE THAT EVERYONE CAN FOCUS ON AND MAKE SURE THAT WE TRY TO GET IT PASSED WITHIN. THE THE PURVIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE SO WITH THAT THE SPONSOR YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- ME ADDRESS YOUR MOST RECENT POINT FIRST AND SAY THAT MR GRACE AND I ARE DEFINITELY TALKING WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT. ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR ONE BILL THAT OUR COLLEAGUES WELL AFTER COLLEGE TO VOTE ON WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY CONFUSION OR CONSTERNATION ABOUT THE TWO BILLS AND SO WERE GETTING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THERE FOR THIS COMMITTEE -- BUT WE HOPE TO GET THERE AND OUR GOAL IS TO GET THERE BY THE TIME WITH THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR IT SHOULD IT SHOULD OUR BILLS GET OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. I WANT TO JUST A COUPLE QUICK ITEMS THAT WERE MADE IN OPPOSITION AND ABBOTT AS I CLOSE ONE IS. IT WAS MENTIONED BY THE IN OPPOSITION THAT DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION ALREADY ILLEGAL -- THAT'S TRUE. BUT IS ALSO A LOOPHOLE THAT YOU COULD DRIVE A TRUCK THROUGH. AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT THE LANDLORD NEED NOT STATED REASON FOR AFFECTION IT'S JUST A NOTICE OF AFFECTION. AND SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT CAN BE FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON AT ALL IT COULD BE FOR AN ARBITRARY REASON IT COULD BE FOR DISCRIMINATORY REASON IT COULD BE FOR RETALIATORY THAT WE DON'T KNOW. BECAUSE IT'S A BLACK BOX IT'S A MYSTERY TO QUESTION MARK. IT'S NOT BEEN ARTICULATED BY HAVING THIS ADDED. LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE OF TRANSPARENCY OF OPENNESS ABOUT WHAT THAT ARTICULATED REASON IS FOR THE EVICTION WE PROVIDE MORE PROTECTIONS -- TO OUR TENANTS WHO ARE IN A STATE OF CRISIS THROUGHOUT -- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO HEARD IN OPPOSITION THAT INCREASE RENT IS IS THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME OF THIS JUST BECAUSE BILL. THAT MAY BE. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE NEED. MR CHOOSE BILL THEY GO HAND IN HAND JUST BECAUSE GOES HAND IN HAND WITH AFTER RECOUNTING WE NEED BOTH. AND SO -- WHERE WHERE WHERE THAT POTENTIAL IF JUST BECAUSE MOVED ALONE BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST BECAUSE ALONE BUT IT'S IT'S COUPLE TO MR CHOOSE ANTI RENT GOUGING BILL? NOW DOES A LOT OF QUESTION ABOUT THE FACT THAT WITH JUST BECAUSE OF ACTIONS. AS PROPOSED UNDER THIS BILL. LANDLORDS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFECT TENANTS FOR JUSTIN FAIR REASONS. AND A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WITNESSES AT TRIAL. AND BEING IN FRONT OF A JUDGE IN IN IN A TRIAL. THE FACT OF THE MATTER THAT TENANTS RARELY HAVE THE LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO GO TO A CONTESTED TRIAL. AND THAT THE VACATIONS ARE NOT RESOLVED AT TRIAL. MANY TENANTS WERE THEY RECEIVE AN EVICTION NOTICE. COMPLY AND VACATE. IF A IF LITIGATION. AND LEGAL ACTION MUST BE TAKEN THEN. I IT'S USUALLY IT'S TO A DETAINER ACTION. AND BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE REPRESENTATION TENANTS 40% OF THE TIME. THIS IS RIGHT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- LOSE THEIR IT UNLAWFUL DETAINER CASE BY DEFAULT. SO YOU DON'T DON'T IN A TRIAL DON'T IN FRONT OF QUARTERS NORTH WITNESS BEING ASKED TO TESTIFY -- WHEN A TENET DOESN'T? VACATE AFTER RECEIVING AN EVICTION NOTICE OR DOESN'T LOSE UNLAWFUL DETAINER CASE BY -- DEFAULT OFTENTIMES THEY LOSE BY MISS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. AND ONLY IN VERY FEW CASES DO WE GO TO COURT FOR A CONTEST TO TRIAL SO SO LET'S NOT. USE -- THE EXCEPTION. AND TURN THAT INTO THE BIGGEST ARGUMENT AGAINST US BECAUSE BECAUSE IT BECAUSE IT REALLY HAPPENS AND FRANKLY NO IT WAS SAID THAT THERE ARE. TENANTS WITH QUOTE TREMENDOUS BAD BEHAVIOR. WHO WE CANNOT -- AFFECT IF IT'S TREMENDOUS BAD BEHAVIOR. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT QUITE EASILY. I IN YOUR IN YOUR FILINGS WITH THE COURT OR CERTAINLY IN A TRIAL. SO. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE THIS BILL IS NOT. TO TO PROTECT TENANTS WHO THAT FROM THERE THERE IS CAUSE FOR THEIR ADDICTION -- WHEN IT'S FAIR AND JUST? TENNIS CAN BE AFFECTED. WHEN IT'S NOT WHEN IT'S ARBITRARY? WHEN IT'S RETALIATE FOR WHEN IT'S DISCRIMINATORY THEY OUGHT NOT BE -- WE ALSO HAD AT SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT ABOUT PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS. YOU KNOW THIS JUST BECAUSE THERE'S NOT. ENOUGH FLIP THE POWER DYNAMIC HERE AND AND MAKE TENANTS ALL POWERFUL [inaudible] IT. IT. DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO EVEN IN THE SCALES. THIS IS A MODICUM AFFAIR MODICUM OF PROTECTION. FOR TENANTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHO ARE IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY. IT'S A POWER RELATIONSHIP THAT VERY MUCH FAVORS LANDLORDS AND WILL CONTINUE. TO BUT IT PROVIDES A EIGHT A LEVEL OF OF DECENT DIGNIFIED PROTECTION. FOR TENANTS -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND YOU KNOW. I APPRECIATE MY MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS ABOUT ABOUT -- HE WRITES A YOU KNOW. I I HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND YOUR APPROACH WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM. I THINK SOME OF THAT THOUGH IS IN MY VIEW IS IS IS. A CONCEPT AND THEORY THAT'S NOT PLAYING OUT ON THE GROUND WE WE ONLY NEED LOOK AT THE OUTCOME SO AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT'S HAPPENING IS NOT WORKING -- AND OUR JOB HERE IS TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC POLICY THAT PROTECTS ALL OF US -- NOT JUST PROPERTY OWNERS NOT JUST LANDLORDS -- BUT EVERYONE INCLUDING OUR TO OUR TENANTS WHO ARE BEING HURT. A LOT RIGHT NOW. AND I WANT TO CLEAR BUT ONE ITEM THERE WAS A POINT MADE THAT BECAUSE OF JUST BECAUSE THE LANDLORD WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO BE. I THINK THE WORD WAS USED A SLUM LORDS OR OR TO NOT UP KEEPER MAINTAIN THEIR PROMISES. TO BE CLEAR THAT OUT WE HAVE ARTICULATED NO FALL JUST CAUSES ONE OF IT IS UNSAFE HABITATION. OR SUBSTANTIAL REMODEL. SO LANDLORDS CAN EVICT OF AS A NO FAULT JUST BECAUSE A TENANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT UPKEEP AND MAINTENANCE. OTHER PROPERTIES THAT'S THAT'S NECESSARY. SO YOU KNOW I WANT TO END BY SAYING THIS. WE'RE NOT TALKING TODAY ABOUT A GARDEN VARIETY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION -- WHEN I TALK ABOUT WIDGETS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT COMMODITIES? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE'S HOME. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR SHELTER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PLACE THEY PUT THEIR HEAD DOWN AT NIGHT. THE PLACE WHERE THEY FEEL SAFE. WHETHER FAMILIES ARE SAFE WITH THEIR KIDS ARE SAFE. AND I BELIEVE WE OWE IT. IN THE STATE OF CRISIS THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. AT AT A TIME WHEN SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE SCREAMING FOR HELP THAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY'RE SCARED. BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HAVE AN EVICTION NOTICE THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY'RE SCARED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT -- UNMAINTAINED PART TO THEIR PROPERTY BECAUSE THEY THINK IT MIGHT BE TURNED TO AN INFECTION NOTICE. THAT WE PROVIDE THEM A LITTLE SUPPORT. AND THIS JUST BECAUSE BILL IS THAT IT PROVIDES A MODICUM OF SUPPORT. AN ADDED LEVEL OF PROTECTION. TO HELP WITH THIS TIME OF CRISIS FOR A SEVENTEEN MILLION TENANTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EYEBALLS. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE I GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CHOW. CHU. CHU I GONZALEZ HOLDEN. HOLDEN I CHOLERA. CALLER I. KYLIE MAIN SHINE. OVER MULTI. OVER **** NO PEACHY NORRIS RACE. THE BILL IS ON CALL. WE NEED A FEW MORE VOTES ON THAT SO WE'LL PLACE IT ON CALL. AND TAKE IT UP BUT WE HAVE MORE MEMBERS HERE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUE THANK YOU STAFF THANK YOU. SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN AV SIXTY NINETY SEVEN MISTER GRACE. AND AS HE COMES UP I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS COMMITTEE OFTEN HAS THE BENEFIT. OF HAVING INTERNS WHO ARE LAW STUDENTS HELPING US OUT. AND IT'S NOT SOMEONE IN FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU DON'T ALWAYS SEE THE RESULT BECAUSE YOU SEE COMMITTEE STAFF. AS HAVING WRITTEN IN THE ANALYSES. BUT WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IS OFTEN TIMES WE HAVE INTERNS THEY PROVIDE A INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF VALUE. AND AND GIVE US THE ABILITY TO DO MORE RESEARCH AND MORE WORK ON THE THE ANALYSES THAT WE DO SO I WANT TO POINT OUT CHANTELLE JOHNSON. WHO'S SORT OF HIDING IN THE CORNER HERE WHO IS BEN A AND THEN TURNED ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS AND TODAY IS HER LAST DAY. COMMITTEE WANT TO SAY OFFICIALLY THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK AND THE TIME THAT YOU'VE PUT IN YOU'VE MADE THIS COMMITTEE. BETTER YOU HAVE HELPED US ANALYZE BILLS AND MOVE US THROUGH THE PROCESS I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHTS MR GRAYSON WELCOME. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. SIXTY NINETY SEVEN FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE GOOD WORK ON THIS BILL AND LET YOU KNOW THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AS AUTHOR AUTHORS AMENDMENTS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA FOR SHARING HIS STORY AND SO ELOQUENTLY AND ABLY. SHARING HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE. THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THE LONG TERM MULTI DIMENSIONAL NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT ANY VICTIM HAS ON RENTER'S ESPECIALLY MOTHERS AND THEIR CHILDREN. I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT I HAVE HEARD. IN MY COMMUNITY AND WHY I FEEL IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MORAL IMPERATIVE TO ADDRESS JUST CAUSE INFECTION. I BECAME INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE THROUGH A FAMILY IN CONCORD. THEY CAME TO ME TO ASK WHAT THEY SHOULD DO WHEN THEY WERE GIVEN A NOTICE TO VACATE THEIR PROPERTY WITHOUT CAUSE. THIS FAMILY INCLUDED SENIORS AND A MEMBER ON LONG TERM DISABILITY. THEIR APARTMENT WAS CLEAN AND WELL KEPT THEY PAID THE RENT ON TIME THEY WERE GOOD TENANTS. THEY ASKED ME WHAT THEY SHOULD DO SHOULD THEY STAY IN THE UNIT AND MAKE THE LAMB OR GO THROUGH THE FORMALLY FICTION PROCESS. AND I TOLD THEM THE RIGHT THING TO DO WAS TO SIMPLY COMPLY WITH THE LAW. BUT I SAW THE FEAR THE UNCERTAINTY AFFECTING THIS FAMILY THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY COULD AFFORD TO STAY IN THE SAME COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY WORKED WHERE THEIR KIDS WENT TO SCHOOL. WHERE THEY WENT TO CHURCH? I REALIZE THAT IT WASN'T THIS FAMILY WHO SHOULD BE ASKING WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO WAS BUT RATHER US. AS THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. AND THAT IS WHY I DECIDED TO CARRY THIS BILL BECAUSE THE HARM CAUSED BY THE VISION IS SO GREAT. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A COMPELLING INTEREST TO INTERVENE. THE REQUIREMENT TO STATE OF BECAUSE IN AN ADDICTION NOTICE GUARANTEES TENETS DUE PROCESS OF LAW THAT GUARDS AGAINST ARBITRARY RETALIATORY AND DISCRIMINATORY EVICTIONS. WHAT IT IS ILLEGAL FOR A LANDLORD TO EVICT SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY ARE A MEMBER OF A PROTECTED CLASS? A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR BECAUSE THE FILE HABIT THE HABIT OF THAT -- ABILITY -- COMPLAINT. IT IS LEGAL TO EVICT THEM FOR NO CAUSE AT ALL. IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE A SITUATION IN WHICH A LANDLORD ACTING IN BAD FAITH COULD USE THIS LOOPHOLE TO MASK THE INTENTION BEHIND A TRULY ILLEGAL EVICTION. A B. SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN WILL SIMPLY REQUIRED THAT A LANDLORD LISTED BECAUSE IN THEIR WRITTEN NOTICE TO TERMINATE A TENANCY. PROVIDE TENANTS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO CURE ANY CORRECTABLE LEAST VIOLATIONS. AND GIVE THEM NOTICE OF THEIR RIGHTS IN THEIR LEASE DOCUMENT. RECOGNIZING THAT A HEALTHY RENTAL MARKET BENEFITS TEN IT'S AN APARTMENT OWNERS ALIKE THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES SEVERAL PROVISIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE POLICY DOES NOT PLACE AN UNDUE BURDEN ON LANDLORDS. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE REQUIREMENT TO LIST THE COST IN ANY TERMINATION NOTICE WILL NOT BECOME OPERATIVE UNTIL A TENET HAS OCCUPIED A RENTAL UNIT FOR AT LEAST TEN MONTHS. I UNDERSTAND THAT LANDLORD SOMETIMES HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE ON A TENANT THIS PROVISION WILL GIVE THEM A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME TO EVALUATE NEW TENANTS. IF THE TENANT DOES NOT LIVE UP TO THE LANDLORDS EXPECTATION FOR ANY REASON DURING THIS TIME THEY CAN BE SERVED A NOTICE TO VACATE WITHOUT A CAUSE. JUST LIKE UNDER EXISTING LAW. THIS MEANS THAT THE RENTERS SUBJECT TO THE JUST CAUSE PROVISIONS WILL NOT BE SHORT TERM UNKNOWN ENTITIES. THESE ARE TENANTS WHO HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR HOMES WHO HAVE PAID RENT AND PLAY BY THE RULES FOR A LONG TIME. CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ARISE IN WHICH A LANDLORD NEEDS TO PULL A UNIT OFF THE RENTAL MARKET. THE BILL ALLOWS FOR A LANDLORD TO REMOVE A TEN IN A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING ORDER INTENT TO OCCUPY THE PROPERTY WITHDRAWAL FROM PROPERTY FROM THE RENTAL MARKET I'D SAVE HABITATION OR INTENT TO DEMOLISH OR TO SUBSTANTIALLY REMODEL. THE PROPERTY FINALLY IN ORDER TO RENT COMPASS OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE HAVE NOT FORCING THE BILL WILL ALLOW FOR A LANDLORD TO TERMINATE A TENDENCY. IN OTHER NO FAULT CIRCUMSTANCES AS LONG AS THEY ARTICULATE A CAUSE AND PROVIDE COMPENSATION TO THE TENANT IN THE FORM OF RELOCATION ASSISTANCE. AB SIXTY NINETY SEVEN INSURERS THAT TENANTS ARE ARE PROVIDED DUE PROCESS GUARDS AGAINST RETALIATORY AND DISCRIMINATORY EVICTIONS THAT HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON FAMILIES CHILDREN. AND THE MILLIONS OF THE FAMILIES OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WHO DO RENT THEY DESERVE THE CERTAINTY AND STABILITY THAT WITH THAT WE WOULD EXPECT THEM TO FIND IN ANY HOME. AB SIXTY NINETY SEVEN IS A BALANCED APPROACH TO THIS CRITICAL TENANT PROTECTION ISSUE AND TODAY MY WITNESS IS -- DENISE PINKSTON FROM DMG PARTNERS. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME'S DENISE PINKSTON I'M WITH TI NG PARTNERS WE ARE A FULL SERVICE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA WE FOCUS ON URBAN INFILL PROJECTS SO YES I AM A BUILDER OF HOUSING. AM I ALSO SERVE CURRENTLY ON THE OAKLAND CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BOARD AND I HAVE BEEN THE CHAIR OF THE BAY AREA COUNCIL HOUSING COMMITTEE. IN MY MY MY COMPANY AND A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE BUSINESS AND DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY ARE INCREASINGLY SEEING THAT IS ESSENTIAL IN HOUSING POLICY FOR US TO COLLECTIVELY DISPENSE. WITH FINGER POINTING AND ACCUSATIONS AND TO FIND A PLACE TO COME TOGETHER AND SUPPORT A HOUSING PACKAGE THAT ADDRESSES PRODUCTION OF NEW HOUSING. AND THE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION OF EXISTING TENANTS AN EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. COME TO THAT IN A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I SERVED ON A TWO YEAR PAINFUL COMMITTEE IN THE BAY AREA THE COMMITTEE TO HOUSE THE BAY AREA. WHERE WE WE MADE COMPROMISES ON TO GREET THE THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T LOVE BUT WE CAN LIVE WITH? AND SO DID TENANT ADVOCATES AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PLANNERS. THIS BILL EXACTLY REPRESENTS THE KIND OF AGREEMENT THAT REASONABLE PEOPLE WHO WERE WILLING TO LAY DOWN THEIR POLICY SWORDS AND FIND A NEW WAY FORWARD. CAN COME TOGETHER ON AND A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SUPPORTED THIS BILL IF AMENDED -- SIXTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF A PACKAGE THAT PROVIDES PROTECTION TO RENTERS WHILE ALLOWING BUSINESS OWNERS LIKE MYSELF TO OPERATE SUCCESSFULLY. IT IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT MANY CALIFORNIA CITIES HAVE THIS THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY HAS HAD A SIMILAR JUST CAUSE OF ACTION REQUIREMENT FOR DECADES. AND THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU WORRY ABOUT IN THE NEW POLICY IN A BIGGER ECONOMY LIKE CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN VETTED IN CALIFORNIA IN NEW JERSEY AND MOST RECENTLY IN OREGON. JUST BECAUSE A FICTION STANDARDS CAN EXIST HOUSING MARKETS CAN WORK WELL LANDLORDS CAN DO THEIR BUSINESS IN A REASONABLE WAY IF THEY'RE WELL CRAFTED. THIS BILL IS WELL CRAFTED TO ENSURE THAT JUST BECAUSE POLICY DOES NOT PLACE AN UNDUE BURDEN ON PROPERTY OWNERS. IT GIVES TIME TO VET THE TENANT WHICH IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS BILL THAT CURRENTLY IS NOT REFLECTED AS MUCH IN THE BOND TO BILL -- IN THIS CASE IT'S TEN MONTHS TO VET TENANTS THAT COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY POSE A DANGER OR A HOUSE OR TO OTHER TENANTS IN THE BUILDING. IT ALLOWS CUSTOMARY JUST BECAUSE STANDARDS LIKE OWNER MOVE IN AND THINGS THAT ALLOW ONE OWNER TO CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS -- AND IT PROVIDES RELOCATION ASSISTANCE WHEN A TENANT IS AFFECTED FOR NO FAULT FOR AN OWNER BUSINESS PURPOSE -- AT WE HAVE RECOMMENDED OUR COMPANY IS RECOMMENDED THAT THAT RELOCATION ASSISTANCE BE CAPPED. AND AS AN EXAMPLE THE RECENT OREGON LAW WHICH DOES INCLUDE JUST BECAUSE OF ACTION PROVISIONS CAPREOL CATION ASSISTANCE AT ONE MONTH'S RENT SO THAT THAT'S A CONVERSATION I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF ACKNOWLEDGE SHOULD CONTINUE. CALIFORNIA NEEDS POLICIES TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD HOMES AT ALL INCOME LEVELS. AS WELL AS POLICIES TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED WHERE THEY ARE TODAY SO IF THEY HIT AN UNEXPECTED BUMP IN THE ROAD OF LIFE WHICH WE ALL WILL. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WE DON'T LOSE THE ROOF OVER OUR HEADS. AB SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE HUMANE AND ECONOMICALLY SUCCESSFUL HOUSING POLICY FOR CALIFORNIA AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU. OTHERS AND SUPPORTS. HOLLY FOR MANY ON BEHALF OF SILICON VALLEY AT HOME AND SUPPORT AS WELL AS HABITAT FOR HUMANITY IS SPACE ALL KIND OF ALLEY. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE AND SUPPORT.

FIVE A B. O. ELEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHAT GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT A BE ELEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR LANDLORDS AND TENANTS TO ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. TO TEMPORARILY RESIDE ON THEIR PROPERTY. THE GENESIS OF THIS BILL IS CONVERSATIONS WITH RESEARCHERS AT UCSF WHO HAVE IDENTIFIED TEMPORARY HOUSING WITH FAMILY OR FRIENDS AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO ALLOW STRUGGLING INDIVIDUALS TO SECURE SHELTER. SAVE RESOURCES REGROUP AND SEARCH FOR MORE PERMANENT OPTION. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT SIX TO FACILITATE THIS PROCESS BY PROTECTING TENANTS WHO WISHED TO HOUSE A FAMILY MEMBER OR FRIEND. AND PROVIDES A LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT WILL INCENTIVIZE BOTH LANDLORDS AND TENANTS TO ALLOW PERSONS AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS TO OCCUPY A UNIT ON THEIR PROPERTY FOR UP TO TWELVE MONTHS WHICH MAY BE EXTENDED BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED AB ELEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT BALANCES THE NEEDS OF ALL OF THE INVOLVED PARTIES SEEKING TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS AND INCENTIVES TO LANDLORDS TENANTS AND INDIVIDUALS AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. IN SHORT WHILE IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING IT PROVIDES LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND A FRAMEWORK THAT WILL ENABLE LANDLORDS AND TENANTS. WHO WISHED TO DO SOMETHING TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ADDRESSING OUR STATE'S HOMELESSNESS CRISIS? I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE THE RESULT OF EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH APARTMENT OWNERS AND HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION AND TEN IN ADVERSITY ADVOCACY GROUPS. AND A PARTICULAR LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR VERY HELPFUL FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS DR KELLY NIGHT A RESEARCHER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU TO BE CLEAR YOU'RE TAKING THE AMENDMENT RIGHTS AS OTHERS OF THEM YES SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. RIGHT THANK YOU A TEAR STONE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS DR KELLY NIGHT AND I'M AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. I'M IN AN I. H. FUNDED RESEARCHER WITH OVER TWO DECADES OF EXPERIENCE RESEARCHING HOMELESSNESS. MY REMARKS TODAY REFLECT THE WORK THAT MYSELF AND DOCTOR MARGOT WHO SHALL PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND LEADING RESEARCHER ON HOMELESSNESS HAVE CONDUCTED TOGETHER. ON THE CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS IN OLDER ADULTS. IN OUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT AMONG THE HOMELESS ADULTS AGED FIFTY AND OLDER 29% HAD STAYED OVERNIGHT WITH A FAMILY OR FRIEND IN THE PRIOR SIX MONTHS. AND 9% REPORTED MOVING IN WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS WE WERE SURPRISED TO LEARN HOW COMMON IT WAS FOR PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO STAY WITH FAMILY OR FRIENDS FOR A SHORT WHILE. AND THEN RETURNED TO THE SHELTER ON THE STREETS. AND WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING AN H. FUNDED RESEARCHERS RESEARCH TO INCREASE THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE BASED TO UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE. WE FOUND THAT FAMILIES AND CLOSE FRIENDS ARE FOR MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AN ONGOING SOURCE OF SUPPORT BOTH EMOTIONALLY AND MATERIALLY. WHILE MANY FAMILY MEMBERS ARE WILLING TO TAKE IN THEIR LOVED ONES THEY FACE MANY BARRIERS IN DOING SO. ONE COMMON REASON THAT HOMELESS OLDER ADULTS DID NOT STAY LONG TERM WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS WAS DUE TO THE HOUSE FAMILY MEMBERS FEAR OF VIOLATING THEIR LEASE BY HAVING A NON LEASEHOLDER STAY WITH THEM. THIS FEAR OF CAUSING ADDICTION CAME UP IN OUR INTERVIEWS WITH HOMELESS ADULTS WOULD STAY WITH FAMILY MEMBERS BUT THEN LEFT. SUCH AS THIS OLDER MAN WHO STAYED ONLY TEMPORARILY WITH HIS SISTER. HE SAID I DON'T STAY THERE WITH MY SISTER OF COURSE NOT SHE WOULD BE AFFECTED IF THEY LACK OF THE LANDLORD KNEW SO OFFICIALLY I DON'T STAY THERE BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE LEASE. WE ALSO HEARD THIS FROM FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL WHO EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT HOSTING A ABOUT HOSTING A HOMELESS FAMILY MEMBER. ONE WOMAN WE INTERVIEWED WANTED TO BE ABLE TO OFFER HER BROTHER A PLACE TO STAY AFTER HE HAD WITNESSED A SHOOTING WHILE LIVING ON THE STREET AND WAS TRAUMATIZED. BUT SHE FEARED THAT THE FOR LANDLORD KNEW ABOUT HER BROTHER STAY SHE WOULD LOSE HER HOUSING. WE FOUND THAT STAYING WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS BOUGHT ALSO BROUGHT BENEFITS BEYOND JUST PROVIDING RESPITE. FROM SHELTER OR THE STREETS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS OFTEN PROVIDED NEEDED ASSISTANCE SUCH AS GETTING HELP TO MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS GETTING HELP GETTING PAPERWORK IN ORDER MANAGING MONEY AND HELP FIGHT FINDING PERMANENT HOUSING. HOMELESS ADULTS WHO STAYED WITH FAMILY VIEW THIS OPTION A SAFER AND MORE DIGNIFIED THAN STAYING IN SHELTERS OR ON THE STREET BUT THEY ALSO SOUGHT. A LONG TERM PERMANENT HOUSING SO THEY SAW IT AS AN EXIT AWAY TO EXIT HOMELESSNESS QUICKLY REGROUP SAVE THE RESOURCES AND LOOK FOR A MORE PERMANENT OPTION. WE BELIEVE THAT HOUSING WITH FAMILY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BRIDGE HOUSING A LOWER COST WAY TO HOUSE PEOPLE TEMPORARILY RATHER THAN NECESSARILY A PERMANENT SOLUTION. BUT WITH THE ENORMOUS TOLL OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA OUR RESEARCH SHOWS. THAT. WE NEED TO BE SUPPORTING OUR FAMILIES TO PROVIDE ONE SOLUTION TO GETTING HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS INSIDE AND STABILIZED WHILE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SEEKING MORE PERMANENT HOUSING. AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT IN A WAY THAT HOLDS FAMILIES AND YOUR FRIENDS HARMLESS SO THEY DO NOT RISK THEIR OWN EVICTION. OR HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THEIR OF THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HELP A LOVED ONE IS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. TONY WITH THE A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT SO SHE SHE'S WANTED THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US. EARLY ON WE DON'T HAVE POSITION YET BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO -- IT'S A GREAT CONCEPT AND GREAT -- BILL THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

HADN'T OPPOSE LIST AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL -- BECAUSE IT DIDN'T REQUIRE THE ATTENDANT TO OBTAIN A WRITTEN LANDLORD APPROVAL HOWEVER THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- THAT I BELIEVE ARE CONTAINED IN THE COMMITTEE PACKAGE TODAY -- ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AND SINCERELY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF IS WAS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US TO RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS WE ARE NOW NEUTRAL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO TROLL OTHERWISE. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE OF IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SAYING THAT THIS GAME REALLY MAKE CLOTHES YEAH I JUST THINK THE COMMITTEE -- I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF AGAIN FOR YOUR VERY HELPFUL -- SUGGESTIONS AND FEEDBACK I THOUGHT THERE WERE SOME VERY ELEGANT SUGGESTIONS IN THE COMMITTEE -- ANALYSIS -- YOU KNOW THIS THIS TO ME IS -- WHAT I SEE AS AS WHAT I HOPE TO BE THE BEST A PUP POLICY MAKING WHICH IS EVIDENCE BASED PUBLIC POLICY MAKING WE WENT -- AS I SAID AND SAT WITH SOME RESEARCHERS AT THE UC SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO. TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE DON'T THINK THIS IS -- THE WHOLE SOLUTION OR EVEN THE MAJOR SOLUTION BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO TO BE HELPFUL AND SO -- HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I VOTE. THANK YOU I'M LOOKING FOR A MOTION THAT MOTION WOULD BE DO PASS AS AMENDED. I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. DOWN BY STONE I GALLAGHER CHOW HOLDEN I CHOLERA. CALLER I.

PLEASE THANK MISTER MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE A CALIFORNIA STATE LAW CURRENTLY PROTECTS PARTIES IT ENTER INTO PREMARITAL AGREEMENTS BY REQUIRING THAT SEVEN DAYS ELAPSED BETWEEN WHEN THE AGREEMENT IS PRESENTED AND WHEN THE AGREEMENT IS SIGNED. HOWEVER SOME DISPUTE HAS ARISEN OVER WHAT OCCURS WHEN AN AMENDMENT IS IS PREPARED FOR A PREMARITAL AGREEMENT WHETHER OR NOT THAT SEVEN DAYS STARTS FROM THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT OR WHEN THE AMENDMENT WAS PRESENTED. ALSO THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT SEVEN DAY PERIOD APPLIES TO PARTIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED PARTIES THAT ARE UNDER REPRESENTED OR BOTH. SO THIS BILL IS A COMMON SENSE CLARIFICATION TO EXISTING STATE LAW. IT WOULD CLARIFY THAT THE SEVEN DAY PERIOD STARTS FROM ANY SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENT THAT IS PRESENTED TO THE AGREEMENT THAT WOULD CLARIFY THAT STATE LAW PROTECTS BOTH REPRESENTED IN UNDER REPRESENTED PARTIES.

AND WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT ARE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WILL -- MAKE THIS A GOOD BILL FOR EVERYONE [inaudible] THANK YOU. FIRST WITH US PLEASE. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS LAWRENCE RUSSO AND I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO. I AM HERE TODAY TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR A. B.. TWELVE EIGHTY SIX I WAS IN SAN DIEGO IN OCTOBER AFTER COMPLETING A THREE HUNDRED MILE BIKE RIDE FROM SANTA BARBARA IN SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION. AFTER THE RIDE I DECIDED TO REMAIN IN SAN DIEGO FOR A FEW DAYS. AND VISIT THE NAVAL BASES I AM A RETIRED NAVAL VETERAN. I WAS GOING TO TAKE THE TROLLEY TO THE BASE. BUT I LEARNED IT WAS QUITE A DISTANCE TO WALK SO I DECIDED. TO RENT TO SCOOTER. I'D BEEN ON TO THE PREVIOUS DAY SO I WASN'T. I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE USE AND THEY WERE ALL. ROB -- THEY WERE ALL -- BIRD SCOOTERS. WHEN I WAS ON THE SCOOTER I DECIDED THAT I I WAS DESCENDING A HILL WHICH BECAME QUITE STURDY? WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES THEY FAILED? IMMEDIATELY I ASK MYSELF WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW -- WHAT THING THAT CAME TO MIND WAS? STARING INTO A DRIVEWAY. IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS YARDS AND HOPING I CAN GO OVER THE RETAINING WALL THE EDGE OF THEIR PROPERTY. A SECOND THOUGHT WAS TO GO TO THE BOTTOM AND TURNED SHARPLY UP THE ROAD THAT SEEM TO BE IN ASCENDING. ONE I REMEMBER NOTHING AFTER THAT -- FRIGHT BLACKED OUT AND DIDN'T WAKE UP UNTIL I WAS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM IT UCSD -- AND I HAD A HELMET ON AND I HAVE A HELMET ON DOCTOR WAS TALKING TO ME AND AND DESCRIBING BYE. BYE INJURIES [inaudible] AND THEN ASKED ME. IF I WAS WILLING TO LET THEM BRING ME -- TO ARE. BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO PAINFUL TO KNOWN TO HAVE ALL MY WOUNDS CLEAN [inaudible] KNEES ELBOWS BACKS OF BOTH HANDS. SO I SAID OKAY. IF YOU MUST. WOULD YOU AGREE TO DONATE YOUR ORGANS IF WE IF YOU DON'T COME OUT OF IT AS THAT WAS A REALITY CHECK IT SAID. CERTAINLY BUT I HOPE I DO MAKE IT MAKE IT FROM THE OPERATING ROOM -- I ALSO HAD TO HAVE STITCHES ON MY LEFT HANDED AND MY RIGHT ELBOW. BUT UNFORTUNATELY -- I I HAD A HELMET ON SO -- I SURVIVED THE INCIDENT I NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE HAD I NOT HAD THE HELMET ON I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR TWO AND A HALF DAYS AND STILL HAVE SOME RECURRING -- DISCOMFORT IN IN MY HANDS IN THE ELBOW. AND SOME COGNITIVE ISSUES. ESCHOOL NEWS MAY PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. BUT THEY NEED TO BE YOU WELL MAINTAINS. SO THAT THOSE THAT RIDE UPON THEM. CAN BE SAFE. RIGHT NOW THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY RECOURSE AGAINST THESE COMPANIES. IMAGINE YOURSELF RENTING A CAR ONLY TO FIND THAT. THE BRAKES DIDN'T WORK WHEN YOU WERE DESCENDING A HILL. AND YOU HIT A WALL -- WORSE A CHILD -- BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T STOP THE VEHICLE. YOU HAVE SOME RECOURSE AGAINST. CAR RENTAL AGENCY OR THE CAR MANUFACTURER. BUT IT'S THE SCOOTER COMPANIES DON'T SEEM LIABLE FOR ANYTHING RIGHT NOW. THAT HARDLY SEEMS FAIR. THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION I BELIEVE TO MAKE SURE THAT MINIMUM SAFETY AND INSURANCE PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE. A B. TWELVE EIGHTY SIX DOES THIS AND I RICHER SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS. HELLO I'M CHRISTOPHER DOLAN FROM THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IS A PAST PRESIDENT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR PROVIDING US THIS TIME TODAY. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND TIMELY BILL. JUST LIKE WE DEALT WITH A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK CARRIERS WE HAVE HAD. A CARPET BOMBING OF SCOOTERS ALL OVER OUR COMMUNITIES -- BEFORE ANY REGULATIONS OR ANY PERMISSION ADVENT SAW. AS A RESULT WE'RE SEEING A RISE IN INJURIES THAT ARE HAPPENING FROM THE SCOOTERS. AS YOU JUST HEARD. CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN THE BILL SUCH AS THE INSURANCE MAKE SURE THAT THE COMPANIES THAT ARE PROVIDING THESE SCOOTERS ARE COMPANIES THAT HAVE SOME SOLID FOUNDATION TO THEM AND CAN BE. IN A POSITION TO PAY FOR ANY HARMS THAT THEY CAUSE. ADDITIONALLY IT PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REGULATION BY THE LOCAL CITIES AND GOVERNMENTS AND AND REQUIRES THEM TO PUT FORTH THESE REGULATIONS SO THAT THERE IS SOME FORM. OF REGULATION OVER THESE DEVICES AND IT'S NOT JUST THE WILD WEST. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL AND I KNOW ONE OF THE ONES IT'S MOST CUT THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL. IS THE RELEASE AND WAIVER LANGUAGE. AND I WANT. TO DISCUSS WITH THE COMMITTEE WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. SO WITH SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS THAT ARE IN THESE PROVIDERS CLICKING ACCEPT AGREEMENTS INCLUDE A ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP. ON ANY DAMAGES THAT ARE CAUSED BY THE PROVIDERS -- NEGLIGENCE FOR THE PROVISION OF THE FAULTY DEVICE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN IT. IN ANOTHER ASPECT IS THAT THEY CHANGE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS TO REDUCE IT SO THAT AN INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT HAVE ANY AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY NEED TO FIND A LAWYER. AND THE INVESTIGATING PROSECUTOR CLAIM. NOW THESE ARE SUBSTANTIAL ALTERATIONS IN THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY ARE ON AWARE OF BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW CLICKING ACCEPT. IS A WAY THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST GETTING ACCESS WITHOUT FULLY KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE DOING. IN THE RELEASE IN WAIVER THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING. SO WHAT WOULD A RELEASING WAIVER -- PROVIDE PROTECTION FROM FOR THESE COMPANIES. WELL BIRD HAS JUST CREATED ITS OWN SCOOTER. AND NOT ONLY IS IT A PUTTING A SCOOTER ON THE STREET BUT IT IS DESIGNED IN MANUFACTURING THE SCOOTER. A BIRD IS A COMPANY THAT IS THE FASTEST COMPANY TO REACH A ONE BILLION DOLLAR VALUATION. IT'S REAL IT'S RAISED OVER NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS AND IS VALUED CURRENTLY AT OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS. SO THESE ARE NOT COMPANIES ARE GONNA BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS BY COMMON SENSE REGULATION. BUT IF THEY'RE SCOOTER IS PUT ON THE ROAD AND AS WE'VE HEARD THE BRAKES FAIL. ARE THERE INSTANCES THAT WE'VE SEEN OF THE STEERING COLUMN COLLAPSING ON THE VEHICLES AND EVEN BATTERY FIRES. IF THIS THESE WAIVERS AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK -- CLAUSES ARE NOT REMOVED IN THOSE COMPANIES WOULD BE COMPLETELY IMMUNE FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEVICES THAT THEY NOT ONLY PUT ON THE STREET. BUT THEY ARE DESIGNING AND THEY'RE PRODUCING. MOREOVER THESE RELEASES EXTEND TO OTHER MANUFACTURERS. SO WHEN SOMEONE TAKES ONE OF THE SCOOTERS OUT THE RELEASE IN WAIVER RELEASES IN WAVES THE MANUFACTURE. OF A SCOOTER IF IT'S NOT THE PROVIDER IN AND THAT'S UNHEARD OF THAT'S LIKE RENTING A CAR AND PROVIDING A RELEASE AND WAIVER TO FORD OR GM OR ANOTHER CORPORATION IF THEY HAVE A CAR. THAT HAS FAULTY BRAKES OR CATCHES ON FIRE. SO THESE ARE REALLY OVER BROAD AND THEY PROVIDE A PROTECTION NOT TO THE CONSUMER BUT A PROTECTION THAT ONLY PROTECTS THE COMPANIES. THAT ARE MAKING CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF MONEY OFF OF THESE. WHAT ELSE IS IMPORTANT? WELL WE HAVE THE JAM ON THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION TALKING ABOUT A MARKET INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INJURIES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THE SCOOTERS. THEY'RE A BAND -- POLLS OF EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANS SUCH AS IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT HAVING TEN OF THESE INJURIES COMING IN A WEEK. SO IF WE PROVIDE IN THE M. UNITY WHICH IS REALLY WHAT A RELEASE AND WAIVER IS TO THESE MANUFACTURERS. THEN THEN WHO'S GOING TO PICK UP THE BILL FOR THESE INJURIES. MANY OF THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD A CAR. IN SO THEY'RE RIDING A SCOOTER AND MANY OF THEM ARE UNINSURED SO WHO'S GOING TO PICK THAT UP MEDIC COW THE TAXPAYERS. IN THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING WHEN YOU HAVE COMPANIES THAT ARE VALUED AT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS [inaudible] SO. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ENTIRETY. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE OPPOSITION TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS AN ACTIVITY AND LIKE MANY ACTIVITIES THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK IN THE ACTIVITIES. THOSE ACTIVITIES OR SKY DIVING SKIING THIS IS NOT AN ACTIVITY. THIS IS A A BUSINESS PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION SERVICES FOR WHICH THEY CHARGE. IT AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN ENJOY IT. YOU SHOULDN'T ASSUME THE RISK BUT THAT THE PARALLEL OF THAT IS RENTING A CAR THAT'S A CONVERTIBLE IN BECAUSE IT CAN BE FUN BECAUSE THE WIND BLOWS THROUGH YOUR HAIR. DID THEN THERE SHOULD BE AN ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK FOR USING THAT VEHICLE. THE ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK IS IS BAD POLICY. IT BENEFITS AND PROVIDES PROTECTION FOR ONLY ONE ENTITY THE ENTITY WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAS NO INCENTIVE THEN TO REPAIR MAINTAIN OR MAKE SURE THEIR PRODUCTS ARE SAFE FOR THEIR INTENDED USERS. SO I I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES ON THIS AND APPRECIATE THE TIME AND ATTENTION IS BEING GIVEN. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE AND SUPPORTS. YOU COME FOR GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLACE. YEAH. AFTER THE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RUBBER TO GO HERE ON BEHALF OF LEAVE CALIFORNIA CITIES -- WANT TO SAY THAT WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKING IN THE LAST COMMITTEE PLUS THE MOMENT THAT THE AUTHORS AG HAS AGREED TO IN THIS COMMITTEE. OF THE LEAGUE WILL MOVE TO A FORMAL SUPPORT POSITION -- AND IF THE AUTHOR WOULD CONSIDER IT -- WE WOULD ALSO BE LIKE TO ADDED AS A CO SPONSOR POTENTIALLY AT THE IF THE IF THE AUTHOR SO PLEASE IS SO -- WITH THAT JUST WANTED -- TO LET'S START A POSITION FOR THE RECORD THANK YOU THANK YOU. DANIEL TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. HER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE AND SUPPORT. RIGHT SEEING NONE SIR OPPOSITION. ONE IS ON HIM. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COURT IN JENSEN ON BEHALF OF TECH THAT -- FIRST ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR AND THIS COMMITTEE FOR ADDRESSING MANY OF OUR CONCERNS I'M VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE DIRECTION THAT THIS BILL IS HEADING. I'M JUST UP HERE TODAY -- TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE REMAINING ISSUES -- WITH AND CONTINUING OUR POSE POSITION -- ON THE WAIVERS AND RELEASE AND THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WHICH PROHIBITS WAIVERS AND RELEASE AND AND USER AGREEMENTS FOR SHARED. MOBILITY DEVICES ARE REMAINING CONCERN THE WAIVERS AND RELEASES ARE STANDARD FEATURES -- DESIGNED TO PROTECT COMPANIES FROM LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTS BECAUSE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN -- WE BELIEVE THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD STILL APPLIES AND SO THIS IS SIMPLY A SOMETHING THAT WE THAT IN THE WAIVER SOME LIABILITY IS REALLY AT MAKING SURE THE COMPANY IS NOT LIABLE FOR SOMETHING THERE'S COST OR NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN -- SO JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR THIS WOULD BE -- SINGLING OUT SHARED MOBILITY HOW AMONG INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA FOR LIMITATIONS ON THEIR FREEDOM OF CONTRACT -- AND THEN ALSO JUST TWO SMALL REMAINING CONCERNS I'M IN THE DEFINITION OF SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE -- RELATED TO LANGUAGE IT SAYS VIA A DIGITAL APPLICATION OR OTHER ELECTRONIC OR DIGITAL PLATFORM THIS PROVISION WOULD PROHIBIT ACCESS TO THE PRODUCTS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE A DIGITAL APPLICATION. FOR EXAMPLE SUCH INSTANCES WERE RENTALS ARE COMPLETED VIA PHONE SUPPORT -- AND THEN JUST SO IT'S SMALL WANT ANY INSURANCE PROBE -- PORTION OF THE BILL WITH THE LANGUAGE OF LESS THAN AND WE'RE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A CONSISTENCY ACROSS LOCALITIES IN THE INSURANCE COVERAGE PROVISIONS BUT AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S POSITIVE DIRECTION OF THIS BILL. AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ERIN RYE BROOK ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. GREAT CAMPBELL ON BEHALF OF LIME ALSO IN OPPOSITION BUT APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HOPE WE CAN BE IN SUPPORT. ALICIA PECK ON BEHALF OF BIRD APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR WE'RE CURRENTLY OPPOSE BUT HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET TO A PLACE THAT'S WORKABLE. MY CRIME SCENE ON BEHALF OF UBER -- CURRENTLY OPPOSE THE BILL THAT REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THE AUTHOR'S DOING AND LOOK FOR THE CONTINUING THOSE EFFORTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. I THINK THAT'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. IS WITH US AND THEN I I AM NOT ASKING QUESTION I KNOW THE ANSWER TO I I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT PROVISIONS WE HAVE -- OR IF WE HAVE PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THIS TYPE OF LIABILITY -- SUPPORT FOR A RIDE CHER COMPANIES. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS A BILL -- THAT WAS SPONSORED BY AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT DNIA. THAT REQUIRED THE TEA AND SEES THAT WERE REFUSING TO OBTAIN INSURANCE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE UP TO A MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER. ANY TYPE OF INCIDENTS CAUSED BY THEIR DRIVERS INCLUDING UNDER INSURED UNINSURED MOTORIST COVERAGE. CURRENTLY THE TORT SYSTEM THE NEGLIGENCE SYSTEM IS WORKING AS IT RELATES TO THESE TN SEASON THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CASES RELATING. TO NEGLIGENT DRIVING AND TO ANY TYPE OF FAULTY EQUIPMENT THE DRIVER MAY HAVE SO THE NEGLIGENCE SYSTEM IS WORKING AND I'M. WITH DUE RESPECT TO TECH NET. IF THESE THIS BILL IS NOT PASSED THE NEGLIGENCE SYSTEM IS KILLED IT IS CUT OUT BY THE RELEASE AND WAIVER. IF THERE IS NO ABILITY TO CLAIM NEGLIGENCE AGAINST THE MANUFACTURERS ARE PROVIDERS WITH THIS RELEASE AND WAIVER. DID I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. SOMEWHAT I DO REMEMBER THE BENNY A BELL MY CONCERN IS THIS AND I'LL JUST SAY THIS OVER I'M DEFINITELY VOTING FOR THAT SOME. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BEEN MOVED. MY MY CONCERN IS -- AS CITIES -- A LOT OF WHICH GANG UP ON ON THESE PRODUCTS -- AND THESE ARE THE LAST MILE KIND OF US SOLUTIONS FOR A LOT OF AREAS AND% WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REGULATIONS IN THE OWNERS -- HAVE REQUIREMENTS WE PLACE ON THEM AREN'T -- AREN'T MORE THAN WE PLACE ON CARS THAT ARE BEING UTILIZED IN SIMILAR FASHION THROWN OUT BASED -- S. SYSTEM THAT'S ALL I'M YOU KNOW I I DON'T WANT TO DISFAVOR -- ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION OF ANY SORT -- I GUESS THIS IS MOTORIZED BUT STILL -- OVER AT THE USE OF CARS OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BETTER FOR ENVIRONMENT WE NEED TO KEEP THAT IN MIND THE BILL WILL PROVIDE EQUALITY AMONGST ALL IT WILL NOT IN ANY WAY PUT AN ONEROUS BURDEN. IT WILL JUST MERELY RELEASED SECULAR OVER TO THEM PART WAS AN ACTUAL QUESTION THERE MISS CORA. THANK YOU MR CHAD THANK YOU A SOME MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IS A DEFINITELY A TOUGH ISSUE THAT TO TAKE ON AND AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT -- WORKING WITH OPPOSITION ON SOME OF THE DETAILS BECAUSE AT THAT HIM BEING IN SAN JOSE CERTAINLY. UP I ACTUALLY USE THOSE TWO COMPANIES I USE THEM FREQUENTLY -- THERE DEFINITELY PROVIDE A SERVICE BY THE VALUE AT THE SAME TIME -- THERE YOU KNOW THAT THE LOCAL AND AND SOUNDS A IN CITY HALL THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT -- HOW TO DEAL WITH THE SAFETY ISSUES SOUNDS A STATE CAMPUS IS BANNED THEM AS ACTION IDEAL CAMPUS TO HAVE THEM BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY ACCIDENTS? IT'S A NEW THING. THAT LIKE WOULD LIKE ANYTHING NEW WE WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT NOT JUST REGULAR REGULATORY. MEASURES BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE USING IT ARE PROTECTED IN A MANNER THAT STILL ALLOWS INDUSTRY -- BUT TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE BUT I THINK THAT -- I'M GLAD THAT THIS BILL IS GOING FORWARD I'M CONFIDENT OF THE FLORIDA THIS COMMITTEE BUT AS IT DOES -- I I LOOK FORWARD TO IT -- WILL. THE THE ADDING THAT THE FOR THE CLARITY AND DETAILS BUT I THINK IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH SORRY SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUST. TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF OF OUR COLLEAGUES -- IN AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE GRAPPLE WITH IN SAN FRANCISCO INTENSELY IT'S GOOD TO SEE FOR SOME OF OUR CONSTITUENTS HERE -- I AM CERTAINLY LIKE MR CAR SOMEONE WHO'S USED THESE DEVICES I HAPPEN TO THINK ELECTRIC BIKES AND SCOOTERS AND OTHER SHARE MOBILITY DEVICES ARE. CONVENIENT ARE ECO FRIENDLY ARE GOOD ALTERNATIVE MODES FOR TRANSIT TO DEAL WITH CONGESTION BUT THAT BEING SAID WE NEED SOME RULES OF THE ROAD WE NEED TO HAVE. SOME MINIMAL STANDARDS -- WE PUT THEM IN PLACE IN SAN FRANCISCO I THINK THIS BILL DOES PROVIDE THAT AS WELL -- AND WITH THAT HAPPY TO SECOND THE MOTION I THINK WAS CALLED CONSULTS MADE. RIGHT WILL TAKE THAT AS A MOTION BY MEN THIS IS ALLISON A SECOND BY MISTER [inaudible] TOO ALL RIGHT. SWEAR TO SEE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I APPRECIATE THAT I REMEMBER BACK TO THE TNC DEBATE IN THIS. HOUSE WHERE WE WERE ALL WRAPPED AROUND THE AXLE IF YOU WILL ABOUT. THE GIG ECONOMY AND MOVING FORWARD IN TECHNOLOGY AND ALL THAT AND ULTIMATELY IT WAS INSURANCE QUESTION BECAUSE WE WERE LEAVING TO MANY PEOPLE WITHOUT RECOURSE. THAT'S ALL WE'RE DOING HERE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. AS WE DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND CAPACITIES AND CAPABILITIES OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO USE THESE INTERESTING NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD. BUT IN THE END WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE IS INJURED AND THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE AND I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE FOR JURISDICTIONS. TO APPROPRIATELY REGULATE IN FACT THEY SHOULD BE BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME. CONSEQUENCES ON STREETS AND SIDEWALKS AND PARKING AND AND OTHER PLACES WHERE I KNOW WE'RE SEEING THIS IN SANTA CRUZ. WHICH FAVORS BICYCLE MOBILITY BUT YET. HAS SOME REAL PROBLEMS WITH A LOT OF THE ELECTRIC BIKES THAT ARE THERE AND THE WAY THAT THEY END UP BLOCKING SIDEWALKS THEIR CHAINS TO EVERY SINGLE POST AND I WOULD HOPE THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES JURISDICTIONS UNIVERSITIES. TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY WITH SOME BACKING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO PUT REASONABLE RULES IN PLACE. REALLY THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID. SO WITH THAT. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU SIR I REALLY APPRECIATE AGAIN THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THIS BILL -- I THINK IT IT IS A MY MUCH STRONGER BILL THAN WHEN WE STARTED I I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS TWO POINTS -- YOU KNOW A FIRST TO EXPRESS APPRECIATION FOR THE LEAGUE OF CITIES -- FOR BEFORE -- THE THE INVITATION -- TO TO BE ADDED AS A CO SPONSOR I I THINK THAT REALLY SHOWS THAT WE'RE TRYING -- TO NOT IMPOSE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT THAT WE WANT TO LEAVE IT TO WHETHER IT'S THE% SENATE'S A CAMPUS OR OR LOCAL CITIES TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN RULES -- BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE THE MINIMUM BASELINE -- SAFE TO REQUIREMENTS THAT -- ARE ARE ARE PROVIDED IN THE IN THIS BILL SECOND. NO AS AN ENVIRO MYSELF I MEAN I WANT TO SEE THIS -- INDUSTRY -- SUCCEED AND SO WELL WE WANT TO SEE IT SUCCEED TO THAT -- AS MS GONZALEZ -- INDICATED THAT WE WE ADDRESS THE LAST MILE -- ISSUE -- IT'S AN IMPORTANT -- MODE OF OF IT CHEAP FUN AND AND ECO FRIENDLY TRANSPORTATION AND SO NOW I WANT TO MAKE IT SUCCEED -- BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS DONE IN A IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS -- CALIFORNIANS AND SO I ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE I GALLAGHER. NO GALLAGHER NO CHOW. CHU. CHU I CONSOLIDATES. GONZALEZ FIVE HOLDEN. GOLDEN EYE CHOLERA. CALLER I. KYLIE. EARLY NO MAIN SHINE. OVER NINETY FOUR NO TINO PEACH NORRIS RADIUS. IT'S TWO MORE VOTES THAT BILL ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU I THINK THIS -- WHAT? ITEM NUMBER SIX AB [inaudible] ELEVEN NINETY WELCOME. OUR NAME MISTER CHAIR AND MANY MEMBERS FIRST I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS REFERENCED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THANK YOU. A LOT OF MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU -- SIX TO PROVIDE A STATEWIDE FRAMES. WORK FOR DRONE REGULATION AND UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS OR DRONES ARE RAPIDLY GROWING MARKET CURRENTLY THERE'S A LACK OF STATE GUIDANCE AS TO WHEN WHERE AND HOW AND MANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS CAN BE OPERATED. SAFELY AND LEGALLY THE LACK OF STATE STANDARDS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO DIRECT USERS ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAW. SO WE'VE WORKED WITH -- INDUSTRY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND AB ELEVEN NINETY SIX PROVIDES STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK AS I MENTIONED FOR DRONE REGULATION GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU FIRST WITH US PLEASE. GOOD MORNING STILL MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE A CHARLES HARVEY ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND SUPPORT WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE -- AND AB ELEVEN NINETY AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED A REFLECTIVE SENSE OF STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES A PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED TO AUTHORIZE A LOCAL -- LOCAL AGENCIES THAT REASONABLE TIME PLACE MANNER REGULATIONS ON THE USE OF DRONES ARE REQUIRE OPERATORS TO REGISTER THEIR DRONES WITH THE FAA. AND ADOPT LAWS AND ORDINANCES THAT EMPOWER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO HELP THE LAW KEEP CURRENT -- WITH THIS NEW AND EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY SO WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA HAVE A DRONE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT -- WHILE RESPECTING THE JURISDICTION OF THE FAA -- PROVIDES FOR THE APPROPRIATE USES OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING IMPORTANT PUBLIC SAFETY PRIVACY -- AND OTHER ISSUES THAT WILL INEVITABLY ARISES DRONES ARE INCREASINGLY USE FOR RECREATIONAL BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSES AND SO. WITH THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND A RELATED STAKEHOLDERS -- TO HELP ENHANCE THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK UNDER THIS BILL AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU EXODUS PLEASE NOT CLUB SCENE ON BEHALF OF DJ I WE JUST WANT TO REALLY THANK THE AUTHOR FOR UNDERTAKING THIS THIS BIG -- GROUP EFFORT TO FIND A COMMON SENSE -- MIDDLE OF THE ROAD SOLUTION HERE WELL JUST WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEE -- CONSULTANT IN THE REST THE COMMITTEE FOR THE REALLY THOUGHTFUL AND ALSO SINCE DOES SUGGEST AMENDMENTS THERE -- LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKE HOLDERS AS WE CONTINUE THROUGH THE YEAR. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THEIR OPPOSITION. SIGNUP BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISERABLE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF SPORT THE BILLING PRIVACY OF CERTAINLY BE SPORTING AGAIN TODAY I JUST ONE COMMENT THAT -- DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO ASK AND PRIVACY BECAUSE I WAS PRESENTING ANOTHER BILL IT'S WHERE -- THERE'S A SECTION HERE THAT PROHIBITS WEAPON ICING A DRONE OR OP IN THE OPERATING A WEAPONIZED DRONES WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING WE CAN ALL AGREE IS A GOOD IDEA. HOWEVER THERE IS A DEFINITION OF WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANS TO WEAPONIZE A DRONE. AND I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYWHERE ELSE IN ST CODE WHERE THAT IS TO FIND AND SO I WANT TO URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT MAYBE. WRITING THAT DOWN AND DEFINING EXACTLY WHAT WEAPONIZED DRONES ARE YEAH I MEAN IT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS THAT WE DON'T WANT A DRONE DROPPING A BOMB SURE. MADE ME THINK ABOUT LIKE A WATER BALLOON IS THAT WEAPONIZED YOU COULD ARGUE THAT ONE EITHER WAY. SO -- I JUST THINK THAT THIS. DESERVE SOME MORE SPECIFICITY. AT THAT COMMENT. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS WAS TOGETHER. DONE HOW DO HOW DO WE GET AT YOU KNOW I THINK THE LEGITIMATE PRIVACY ISSUES POSED BY THIS YOU KNOW I MEAN. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY. AND I THINK MOST ESPECIALLY THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT SURROUNDING THE HOME OUR HOME IS SUPPOSED TO BE KIND OF A HE A CIRCUS IT SHOULD BE A SACROSANCT PLACE. AND I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT DRONES. IS YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW. VIDEO INTO SOMEONE'S BACKYARD YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE THEIR KIDS ARE PLAYING WHERE YOU'RE HAVING. A FAMILY BARBECUE. MAYBE EVEN TO SEE INSIDE PEOPLE'S WINDOWS -- YOU KNOW SO CONSIDERING THAT WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN PROTECTING THAT. THAT PRIVACY INTERESTS -- AND AND YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW THE MAYBE MAKING THE THE REFERENCE POINT TO LIKE YOU KNOW WE DON'T ALLOW -- YOU KNOW SEARCHES AND SEIZURES INTO THE HOME BUT IN EFFECT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY BY THE GOVERNMENT BUT NOW BY THE MORE PRIVATE ENTITIES YOU HAVE IN EFFECT MAY BE THE SAME THING. YOU KNOW HOW HOW HOW DOES THIS. HOW IS THIS GOING TO HELP US GET OUT THAT? THAT ISSUE OR NOT. SO WHAT -- THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WORKING TOGETHER AND TRYING TO FIND. A BASIC FRAMEWORK FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A BIT OF THE WILD WEST AND AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LOT OF DISAGREEMENTS -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISAGREEMENTS ON WHAT'S IN THE INITIAL BILL SHOULD LOOK LIKE THE INITIAL THE INITIAL REGULATORY SYSTEM SO THAT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE THINGS TO LOOK AT GOING FORWARD. BUT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO ESTABLISH BASICALLY WHAT WHERE THERE IS FEDERAL PREEMPTION AND WHAT THE ROLE IS OF THE STATE AND WHAT THE POLICE POWERS ARE OF THE OF LOCAL CITIES AND CITIES AND COUNTIES SELF. ONGOING CONVERSATION. THE FEDERALS AT THE ANY OF THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS AT ALL PROHIBIT THAT KIND OF PRACTICE -- USE OF USE OF DRONES LIKE FOR INSTANCE. TO YELL. I DON'T BELIEVE SO. NOT AT THIS TIME ANYWAY YEAH OKAY THIS IS -- THE THINGS THAT WERE WORK IF WE WERE GOING TO BE WORKING ON IS WHAT IS THAT WHAT ARE THE POLICE POWERS OF THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO ENFORCE THOSE PRIVACY REGULATIONS. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RIGHT SIGNAL MISTER WHEN YOU MAKE CLOTHES. JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR SUPPORT.

OR RETALIATION BY THEIR EMPLOYER BASED ON THEIR STATUS AS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR UNDER THE CURRENT LAW SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND STALKING. MUST BE PROVIDED JOB PROTECTION TIME OFF TO SEEK MEDICAL LEGAL. AND SOCIAL SERVICES AS WELL AS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS IN THE WORKPLACE. UNFORTUNATELY. WHEN THESE RIGHTS ARE VIOLATED SURVIVORS ARE OFTEN LEFT WITH LITTLE TO NO RECOURSE TODAY SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO EXPERIENCE MISCONDUCT AT THE HANDS OF THEIR EMPLOYER ARE ABLE TO FILE? A COMPLAINT HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND A COMPLAINT WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. OR PURSUE A CLAIM UNDER THE PRIVATE BUT UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS PAGA THESE EXISTING OPTIONS OFFER IT -- INEFFECTIVE REMEDIES THAT CAN TAKE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS. TO PROCESS. AND I'LL TAKE THIS MOMENT TO HAVE MY WITNESSES INTRODUCED. AND OFFER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR SERVICE PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KRISTEN I'M STUCK WITH THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION WORKING WITH LOCAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS ALL ACROSS THE STATE REALLY PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE SPELL -- RIGHT NOW THE EXISTING EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS FOR SURVIVORS PROVIDE LIMITED PATHWAYS -- FOR RELIEF THAT FAR WHEN SURVIVORS RIGHTS IN THE WORKPLACE ARE VIOLATED -- A TWENTY TEN SURVEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOUND THAT EITHER HAVING BEEN FIRED OR FEARING TERMINATION BECAUSE OF THEIR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. 34% OF SURVIVOR SURVEYED HAD TO QUIT A JOB BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS IMPACTS CAN BE DEVASTATING TO SAY NO THIS COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE. OF THE LEADING CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS FOR WOMEN AND FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AND THE ECONOMIC REASONS ARE A KEY FACTOR BY SURVIVORS RETURNED. AS IT STANDS IT'S VERY CONFUSING AND DIFFICULT FOR SURVIVORS TO NAVIGATE THE CURRENT ENFORCEMENT -- MECHANISMS AND ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS A B. FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR SURVIVORS TO HAVE A CLEAR PATH TOWARDS REMEDY IS THAT THEY NEED AND WITHOUT WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS WOULD. DO WELL ON BEHALF OF THE CONFERENCE CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS. THIS IS -- BILL TO CLARIFY% EXISTING LONG KNOW. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME THIS CLARITY AND SOME OF THE OPINIONS. THAT HAVE COME DOWN AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION EXISTS. UNLIKELY IT DOES LIKE OTHER PROVISIONS IN LABOR CODE. TO HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH PROVIDES. THE VICTIMS OF IS STRAIGHT FORWARD AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF SEEING THEIR RIGHTS -- ACTED. THIS ONE THIS. FIGHTS THAT RIGHT IN A IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATIONS. FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FOR OTHERS LISTED IN THE CURRENT STATUTE -- ONE THING I WOULD NOTE THAT -- THE ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE BILL IS THAT. IT PROVIDES FOR POSSIBLY DOUBLE DIPPING. BY SOMEBODY FILING DUAL ACTIONS. BUT I THINK THAT THE ANALYSIS -- PRETTY MUCH TO SPELLS THAT. A POSSIBILITY BUT I KNOW IT POINTING OUT THAT IF A PERSON WERE TO GO TO THE TAKE THE ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY AND OBTAIN. OF GOVERNMENT AGAIN TO THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THEN THERE WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR THEM TO GET UNDER A A COURT CASE. AND THEREFORE THERE'S NO POINT IN GOING THAT DIRECTION. HEY YOU WILL AS A VICTIM YOU GET TO PICK YOUR REMEDIES. OR PICK YOUR WAY OF A TRYING TO OBTAIN YOUR REMEDIES. AND THE V. -- FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT GIVES THEM A THE BEST WAY OF TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. TOOK. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE AND SUPPORTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS MICHAEL YOSHIHARA WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLAN MILLERS ASSOCIATION STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE AND SUPPORTS. BUT SEEING THAT IS THEIR OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS LAURA CURTIS ANDI'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH A B. FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT OF COURSE WE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THE ISSUE AT HAND. HOWEVER OUR CONCERNS ARE THAT IT ALLOWS FOR A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AS WELL AS ONE SIDED ATTORNEY'S FEES CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW THE VICTIMS ARE PROVIDED REMEDY. THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT OR THROUGH A PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT CLAIM. SO THERE ARE AVAILABLE AVENUES FOR THE EMPLOYEE TO SEEK RELIEF IN THOSE SITUATIONS WE'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. IS A CHAMPION FOR EMPLOYEES WALKS IN THROUGH THE PROCESS THE SYSTEM THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION AND ALL THOSE ISSUES SO WE DON'T SEE WHY THAT. ISN'T IN A CORRECT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EMPLOYEE TO SEEK RELIEF IN THIS A SITUATION. ADDITIONALLY THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT ALLOWS AN EMPLOYEE. TO ADD TO FILE A CIVIL ACTION FOR ANY LABOR CODE VIOLATION SO AGAIN THERE IS A DIRECT -- CIVIL ACTION THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE EMPLOYEE CURRENTLY. WITH REGARD TO THE ATTORNEY'S FEES PROVISION WE THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY THAT AS ATTORNEYS FEES PROVISION ISN'T NECESSARY IN THIS SITUATION. HOWEVER IF IT IS GOING TO BE ADDED AND SHOULD NOT BE ONE SIDED BOTH PARTIES SHOULD HAVE AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD WHEN IT COMES. TO LITIGATION IN ORDER TO REDUCE FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION ALSO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE BILLS HOLISTICALLY THERE ARE CURRENTLY THREE ASSEMBLY BILLS AMENDING LABOR CODE. TWO THIRTY AND OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT IF YOU HAD A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO THIS BILL AS WELL ADDITIONALLY IMPACT THE OTHER TWO BILLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY -- IN THE ASSEMBLY FOR LABOR CO TWO THIRTY VIOLATIONS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. X. WITNESS MISTER CHAIR KRISTA KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION SORRY FOR MY BACK TO THE OTHER MEMBERS -- JUST IF I COULD ADD A FEW POINTS -- TO MISS CURTIS'S COMMENTS -- THERE IS NO IN NO WAY WOULD WE CONDONE -- ANY OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT IS TRYING TO BE ADDRESSED HERE AND CERTAINLY THE NOTION OF RETALIATION -- SHOULD BECOME BATTED AT EVERY AVENUE OUR BELIEF IS IS THAT THERE ARE APPROPRIATE INSTANCES AND REMEDIES AVAILABLE PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER PROCESS. WE APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF IS SPENT ON THIS ISSUE I THINK THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL OR PHILOSOPHICAL. A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WHETHER THE LAW IS CLEAR UNCLEAR. AND AS USUAL YOUR COMMITTEE COUNSELS ANALYSIS IS THOROUGH IN THAT DISCUSSION WE DON'T THINK THAT ADDITIONAL LITIGATION IS THE PREFERRED APPROACH WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATIVE ROUTE. THROUGH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IS THE APPROPRIATE ROUTE WE'VE BEEN HERE AND BEFORE THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES NUMEROUS TIMES ENCOURAGING ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND POWERS BE GRANTED TO OUR LABOR COMMISSIONER TO COMBAT THIS. AND WE THINK IT IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER LABOR CODE. SECTION TWO THIRTY FOR EXAMPLE IS -- DEFINED IN PAGA AS A SERIOUS VIOLATION OF WHAT THAT MEANS OF COURSE IS THAT. AN EMPLOYER IS NOT ALLOWED THE ABILITY TO CURE. A YOU CAN GO RIGHT TO THAT LITIGATION -- OUR OTHER CONCERN WITH THIS IS THAT IT UNDERMINES PAGA. NIGHTS DENYING YOU KNOW POCKET WAS ENACTED INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AS AN AVENUE FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO BRING ON BEHALF LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALLOWING THIS ADDITIONAL P. R. A. UNDERMINES THAT EFFORT AND THEN LASTLY IS MISS CURTIS INDICATED AND I THINK AS MR CALLERS HERE HEARD HIS BILL AND OTHER BILLS IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE PRIOR TO YOUR COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIR. ONE SIDED ATTORNEY'S FEES WE DON'T THINK IS THE RIGHT ROUTE TO TAKE EITHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. A GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS ARTICULATED BY THE PRIOR OPPOSITION WITNESSES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ERIN RUBBER GONE WE HAVE THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. VAPOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS STATED. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RIGHT SEEING NONE THIS CRAZY MAN CLOSER THIS FEATURE NORRIS I'M. WHAT IS THE RATIONALE I'M FOR GOING DIRECTLY TO THE COURTS RATHER THAN PURSUING THE CURRENTS? ODD MINISTER PROCESSING THROUGH. THE FIVE AT LABOR COMMISSIONER. WELL I THINK -- THE OPPOSITION ACTUALLY STATED THAT IN TERMS OF THEIR OVERWHELMED AND OVERWORKED THERE'S NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES SO WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS ALLOW. A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT HAS EXPERIENCED MISCONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE TO HAVE DIFFERENT AVENUES TO ACTUALLY PURSUE HER CASE HIS OR HER CASE. RIGHT ANYONE ELSE [inaudible] SCREAMING CLOSE. THANK YOU -- AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- IS THE BILL THAT WOULD PROMOTE THE ECONOMIC STABILITY OF SURVIVORS BY EMPOWERING THEM TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION OF RIDING OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO SEEK JUSTICE THROUGH THE ASSISTANCE IN NEGOTIATING THE RETURN TO WORK.
