FROM AN ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.875
ONE CANNOT IDENTIFY WHAT IS THE

OPTIMAL SIZE THE BANK OR EVEN

SAY CONCLUSIVELY WHAT THE BANK

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.080
IS TOO LARGE OR TOO SMALL. THE

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:29.949
OPTICS OF THIS ARE CHALLENGING

THROUGH A MARKET ADJUSTMENT. AND

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:32.812
THIS IS WHERE OLD NUMBER ONE

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.347
REQUIRES A LOT OF ATTENTION TO

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.249
UNDERSTAND THE WHAT WE'RE TRYING

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:41.354
TO- CONVEY. TO THE COMMITTEE. WE

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.455
MENTIONED THE QUALITY

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.991
ADJUSTMENTS SUCH AS WERE

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:45.825
IMPLEMENTED AND REGGIE ARE AN

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:47.894
OPTION ANOTHER OPTION AND

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.629
PERHAPS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN BE

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.597
IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:53.566
ENGAGEMENT. WOULD BE TO RAISE

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:56.002
THE PRICE FLOOR BECAUSE OF

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:58.004
POSSIBLY THAT COULD BE DONE. BY

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.539
THE AGENCY AND THAT RAISING THE

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:03.142
PRICE FOR CRUDE. COULD COULD

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.677
CONSTRAIN THE NUMBER OF

ALLOWANCES THAT ARE ENTERING THE

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:08.314
MARKET. HOWEVER STRONGER IDEA

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.982
MAY BE TO IMPLEMENT AN

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.718
ADDITIONAL PRICE STEP. WHICH

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:14.487
WHICH IS THE AFFECTED REGGIE

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:15.388
IMPLEMENT THE REGIONAL

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:16.822
GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.991
IMPLEMENTED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

WASHINGTON STATE PROGRAM

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.830
DESIGNED. THIS PRICE STEP THAT

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.098
WHICH REGGIE CALLS AN EMISSIONS

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:28.100
CONTAINMENT RESEARCH WOULD BE

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:30.436
ABOVE THE PRICE FOR. WITH ITS

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:31.871
OWN SUGAR PRICE APPLIED TO

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:34.273
APPORTION SAY 10% OF THE

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.776
ALLOWANCES THAT WOULD BE ISSUED

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:39.111
AN AUCTION. BUT SO THE SHARE OF

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:40.279
ALLOWANCES THAT THAT ENTER THE

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:42.648
PROGRAM WOULD BE REDUCED AT A

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:44.583
PRICE BELOW THIS PRICE STEP

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.687
LEVEL. OF THIS CREATES A PRICE

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:50.056
RESPONSIBLE PLIABLE LOUNGE WHICH

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:51.657
IS ALREADY PARTIALLY AFFECTED

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:52.992
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.027
EXISTENCE OF THE PRICE FOR YOU

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:56.629
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT. OR THINK

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:58.364
ABOUT EMISSION CAPS THEY OFTEN

00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.332
THINK THAT THERE'S A FIXED

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:00.499
QUANTITY OF ALLOWANCES UNDER

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:01.934
RIGHT TO ENTER MARKET BUT

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:03.970
CALIFORNIA AND REGGIE THE NORTH

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:05.104
AMERICAN CARBON MARKETS HAVE

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:06.339
ALREADY BEGUN TO MOVE WELL

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:08.040
PASSED OUT BOTTLED THROUGH TRUE

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:10.876
SUPPLY ALLOWANCES. THE RESPONSE

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:12.979
FOR THE PRICE OF THE MARKET AND

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:14.914
THIS YOU KNOW RESEARCH WE

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:16.749
ADVOCATE FOR THE ROLE OF CARBON

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:18.184
MARKETS BECAUSE THE EFFICIENCY

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.418
AND EFFECTIVENESS THAT THEY

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:20.386
BRING IN ACHIEVING EMISSION

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.688
REDUCTIONS BUT IN DESIGNING CAP

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:24.790
AND TRADE MARKETS. THE TYPICAL

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:26.625
APPROACHES THAT FOR JUST THE CAP

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.461
OR NO OTHER COMMODITY MARKET IN

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:30.496
THE WORLD IS LIKE THAT AND OTHER

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:32.131
COMMODITY MARKETS THE SUPPLIER.

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:34.333
OF THE GOOD RESPONSE TO THE

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.602
PRICE OF ALLOWANCES THAT HELPS

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:38.137
YOU PRAYED FOR PRICE OF. THE

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:39.105
COMMODITY THAT HELPS WITH PRICE

00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:40.940
DISCOVERY HELPS CHEEK LIBERMAN

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:42.875
THE MARKET AND IT CAN BE A

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:44.443
REALLY USEFUL TOOL AND IT HELPS

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.244
FOR THE CORPORATE MARKET IN

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.013
CALIFORNIA TO INTRODUCE

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:47.513
SOMETHING LIKE EMISSIONS

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.281
CONTAINMENT RESERVE. SO THAT IF

00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:51.851
THE PRICE FALLS L. AS THE PRICE

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:54.954
FALLS THE END OF BECOMES CHEAPER

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.188
TO ACHIEVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS

00:10:56.255 --> 00:11:03.162
THAT. FEWER EMOTIONAL OUT TO

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:04.997
SOME OF THE MARKET. I'M THE

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:05.898
FINAL END IN. THING WE HAVE. IS

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.433
THE EMPLOYEE THAT PC OF ANY OF

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.901
THESE OF MARKET IS. COULD HELP

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:10.636
ON THE GAS REDUCTION FUND THE

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:11.270
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FOR AS

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.839
YOU KNOW BEEN VERY. FOR DRIVING

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.574
INVESTMENTS IN MEMBERS

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:16.575
COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY

00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:17.276
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.278
CALIFORNIA. RESTRICTING THE

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:22.915
SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCE WHICH COULD

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.417
AFFECT THE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:25.084
REDUCTION FUND. IMPORTANT LESSON

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:25.985
HERE IS THERE IS ACTION

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:29.655
OPPORTUNITY. P. O. THE RESEARCH

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:30.756
RESTRICTING THE NUMBER OF

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:31.991
ALLOWANCES TO ENTER THE MARKET

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:33.359
WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:34.894
PRICE OF OIL CHANGE THE MARKET.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.329
AND THE OVERALL VALUE OF ALLOW

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:38.998
ALLOWANCES THE MARKET WOULD

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:40.933
ACTUALLY INCREASE NOT DECREASE

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.935
BY REDUCING THE SUPPLY OF OIL TO

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:44.270
FOREIGN MARKETS SORT OF LIKE

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:46.205
WHAT. HAPPENS IF A BENEFIT

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.207
MONOPOLY TRIES TO CONTROL THE

00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:49.942
SUPPLY OF SOME GOOD INTRO

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:50.709
MARKETS OVERALL REVENUES COULD

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:53.112
INCREASE. THAT THIS MARKET

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:55.081
DEPEND UPON THIS CASE OF. I CAN

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:56.549
SPEAK PRETTY CONFIDENTLY THAT WE

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:57.550
WOULD EXPECT TO SEE AN INCREASE

00:11:57.616 --> 00:11:59.618
THAT AND THE ASSET VALUE

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:00.653
ALLOWANCES THE CAP ND TRADE

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:02.455
MARKET. THE GLOBAL MARKET

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:04.023
HOWEVER CURRENTLY ABOUT HALF OF

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.224
THE ALLOWANCES THE MARKET ARE

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:10.563
ISSUED FOR FREE. AND IF THE

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:11.197
SUPPLY WAS REDUCED. STRICTLY BY

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:12.364
REDUCING THE SALES. OWNED LAND

00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:15.034
TOOLS DONE THE VALUE OF FREELY

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.335
DISTRIBUTED ALLOWANCES WOULD

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.571
RISE SHARPLY. AND THE GREENHOUSE

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:20.372
GAS REDUCTION FUND WOULD BE

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.508
IMPOVERISHED. WE DESCRIBE AN

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.310
APPROACH THAT WOULD PROTECT THE

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:26.345
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND.

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:27.880
WHICH WOULD PROBABLY REQUIRE

00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:29.615
LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT SO THAT

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:31.217
THE SUPPLY IF THE SUPPLIER

00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:34.753
RESTRICTED. OVERALL EACH CHANNEL

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.022
SUPPLY ENTERING THE MARKET WOULD

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:38.791
BE RESTRICTED PROPORTIONALLY. SO

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:40.593
THAT'S A PRESENTATION OF THE

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:41.660
IDEAS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:43.963

FAVOR QUESTIONS I KNOW. I

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:52.338
WOULDN'T SAY I ENJOYED READING

00:12:52.404 --> 00:12:53.806
THE FORTY TWO PAGE REPORT BY

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:55.908
IRAQ OR IS RATHER THICK BUT- I

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:57.576
DIDN'T WORK MY WAY THROUGH IT.

00:12:57.643 --> 00:12:59.745
NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM- THE

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:03.415

STRENGTHENING THIS PROGRAM AND

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.731
KEEPING IT A VIBRANT AND

00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:20.533
SUCCESSFUL PART. OF THE STATE'S

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:22.001
CLIMATE POLICY PORTFOLIO I THINK

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.736
THERE ARE SOME REAL CHALLENGES

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:24.637
WE NEED TO ADDRESS BUT PLEASE

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:26.305

SPIRIT OF TRYING TO MAKE THESE

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:30.209
THINGS BETTER AND STRONGER AS

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:32.077

BEFORE US WITH I THINK

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.020
SUBSTANTIAL NEW EVIDENCE ABOUT

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:42.922
THE STATE OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.490
AS INSIGHTS FROM OTHER PROGRAMS

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:45.224
AROUND THE WORLD HAVE CONFRONTED

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:47.326
SIMILAR CHALLENGES. I WANT TO

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:48.894

UP ON THE ISSUE OF THE SCOPE AND

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:53.299
PLAN SHOPPED AT THE DALLAS

00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:54.200
TALKED ABOUT AS WELL AS THE

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:56.302
ALLOWANCE BANKING CHAPTER AND

00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:57.403
I'LL CLOSE MY REMARKS BY TALKING

00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:58.904
ABOUT THE ROLE OF CARBON OFFSETS

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:00.439
WHICH PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT PART

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.408
IN THE LARGE A COMPLIANCE

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:02.908
PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE IN

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.411
CALIFORNIA. SO TO START WITH- I

00:14:05.477 --> 00:14:06.912
WANT TO ECHO I THINK POLICY

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:08.113
MAKERS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.115
BALANCE THREE GOALS ONLY TWO OF

00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:11.884
WHICH I THINK CAN BE PRESENT AT

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:14.286
ANY GIVEN TIME. ONE IS TO HAVE A

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:16.422
LARGE ROLE FOR THE CAP AND TRADE

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:17.523
PROGRAM IN ACHIEVING THE STATE'S

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.791
TWENTY THIRTY TARGET THE SECOND

00:14:18.857 --> 00:14:19.992
IS THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:21.560
ALLOWANCE BANKER RELATIVELY LOW

00:14:21.627 --> 00:14:24.230
MARKET PRICES AND THE THIRD IS A

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:25.998
PLAN THAT CAN GET US TO OUR

00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:26.532
TWENTY THIRTY CALL. IT IS

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:28.067
POSSIBLE IN MY OPINION TO GET

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:29.168
TWO OF OUT OF THESE THREE BUT

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:30.736
NOT ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:32.271
AND I THINK WE HAVE PRETTY

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:33.906
CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE

00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:35.641
A VERY LARGE ALLOWANCE BANK AND

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.042
THAT THREATENS THE ABILITY OF A

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:38.544
STRATEGY THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:40.079
THIS PROGRAM TO GET TO THE

00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:41.347
TWENTY THIRTY TARGET.

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:42.548
POLICYMAKERS HAVE IMPORTANT

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.583
CHOICES AS TO THE SIZE AND ROLE

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.884
OF THE PROGRAM IN AN OVERALL

00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:47.553
SCOPE OF THE PLAN PROCESS AND

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.388
THOSE POLICY CHOICES NEED TO

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:50.689
CONFRONT A SERIES OF TRADEOFFS

00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:52.558
WHICH I KNOW ARE FAMILIAR TO THE

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:53.993
LEADERSHIP IN THE EXECUTIVE

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:55.494
BRANCH AS WELL AS THE

00:14:55.561 --> 00:15:00.099
LEGISLATURE. SO JUST FOCUS. ON

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:00.933
THIS ISSUE FOR A SECOND BECAUSE

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.201
I THINK. BALANCING THE ROLE THAT

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:03.168
AND TRADE. IS A- PART. QUESTIONS

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.070
AND IF THE STATE WISHES TO

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:06.005
MAINTAIN A PLANNED ROLE FOR CAP

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:08.240
AND TRADE THAT IS SIGNIFICANT.

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:09.475
IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:10.876
PLAN CAP AND TRADE IS THE SINGLE

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:12.745
LARGEST DRIVER. OF OUR STRATEGY

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:14.713
TO GET TO TWENTY THIRTY IT WAS-

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.515
REPRESENTING ABOUT 38% OF THE

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:17.683
CUMULATIVE REDUCTIONS OVER THIS

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.251
DECADE. NEARLY HALF OF THE

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:20.886
REDUCTIONS THAT CARB EXTRACTED

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.288
AND THAT PLANNING PROCESS TO BE

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:24.056
ACHIEVED BY TWENTY THIRTY. TO

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:25.324
CHOOSE SOMETHING SIMILAR I THINK

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:26.358
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO MAKE

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:27.459
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:29.828
PROGRAM- AND IN ORDER TO FIGURE

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:30.963
OUT. WHAT CHANGES NEED TO BE

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.731
MADE IF ANY IT'S GOINGTO BE

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.066
IMPORTANT IN THE SCOPE AND

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:34.867
PLANNING PROCESS. THE CARD IS

00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:37.202
CURRENTLY UNDER UNDERTAKING. TO

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:38.904
QUANTITATIVELY PROJECT WHERE

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:40.139
CARB THING SUBMISSIONS IS GOING

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:42.508
TO BE. AND TO IDENTIFY A ROLE

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:43.842
FOR THE PROGRAM IN CLOSING THE

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:45.210
GAP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:46.512
SUCCESSFUL AND AMBITIOUS CLIMATE

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:48.280
POLICIES. AND ITS CLIMATE

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:49.348
TARGETS FOR THE YEAR TWENTY

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:51.550
THIRTY- THE SCOPING PLAN CHAPTER

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.519
IN THE I. IMAC REPORT- DISCUSSES

00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:55.387
HOW. THE MODELING WORK TODAY IT

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:56.989
DOESN'T ALLOW US TO ADDRESS ANY

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.023
OF THOSE QUESTIONS BUT I

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.391
UNDERSTAND AND I'M SURE WE'LL

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.125
HEAR MORE FROM THE NEXT

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:01.593
PANELISTS THAT. NEW MODELING

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.995
WORK IS EXPECTED SOON THAT MAY

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:04.863
ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS. THE

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.131
ECHO DALLAS'S COMMENTS THOSE

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:07.199
DEVELOPMENTS WOULD BE VERY

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:08.434
WELCOME AND I THINK WE PROVIDE A

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.102
CONSTRUCTIVE BASIS FOR FIGURING

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.904
OUT WHERE WE NEED TO CALL. WITH

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.205
RESPECT TO THE ALLOWANCE BANKING

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:14.540
CHAPTER I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT JUST

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:15.874
A COUPLE OF ISSUES- BEFORE

00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:17.943
MOVING ON TO OFFSETS- THE

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.311
CHAPTER OBSERVES USING CARBS

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:21.113
DATA THAT THE ALLOWANCE BANK IS

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.381
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:23.916
ONE MILLION ALLOWANCES. THAT'S A

00:16:23.982 --> 00:16:25.684
VERY TECHNICAL NUMBER BUT TO PUT

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.419
IT IN CONTEXT. IT'S ABOUT TWICE

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:29.154
THE SCENARIO THE CARD CONSIDERED

00:16:29.221 --> 00:16:30.222
IN ITS TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.957
RULEMAKING IMPLEMENTING AB THREE

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:33.058
NINETY EIGHT. AND IT'S

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:34.126
SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:35.728
CUMULATIVE PRODUCTIONS CARB

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:37.563
IDENTIFIED AS NECESSARY COMING

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:38.831
FROM THE ENTIRE CAP AND TRADE

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:40.766
PROGRAM OVER THIS DECADE. IN ITS

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:41.800
PREVIOUS COUPLE PLANNED PROCESS

00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:43.802
SO. DALLAS IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:45.604
TO SAY THERE'S NO. MAGIC NUMBER

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.673
OR TARGET WE SHOULD BE AIMING

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.341
FOR BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:49.908
PRETTY CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT.

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:50.909
THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.945
WHAT WE EXPECTED- I THINK IT'S

00:16:53.011 --> 00:16:54.246
ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT-

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:55.881
WE'VE HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS AS-

00:16:55.948 --> 00:17:00.586
SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU'LL NO.

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:01.086
DOUBT RECALL IN PREVIOUS

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:01.720
COMMITTEE HEARINGS. WERE VERY

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:02.621
FOLKS INCLUDING MY- AND ALL. WHO

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.690
RAY CONCERN ABOUT THE- BACK FOR

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:06.392
FIVE YEARS AGO- SOME FOLKS MADE

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:07.793
QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS AND

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.794
THEY THE ALLOWANCE BANKING

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.596
CHAPTER TRACKS THE OUTCOMES

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:12.231
RELATIVE TO THOSE PREDICTIONS. I

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:12.831
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:13.999
HIGHLIGHT THE PEOPLE WHO RAISE

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:16.068
CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE

00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:17.669
ALLOWANCE BANK. MADE PREDICTIONS

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:18.804
THAT WERE VERY CLOSE TO WHAT

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.139
WE'VE OBSERVED. AND WHAT WAS

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:21.373
OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANTLY

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.175
DIFFERENT THAN PAST REGULATORY

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:24.510
PLANNING DOCUMENTS IDENTIFIED

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:26.278
AGAIN THE SPIRIT OF THIS IS TO

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:28.280
IDENTIFY THE NEED. FOR A NEW

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:30.015
DISCUSSION. RATHER THAN JUST

00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:31.216
SORT OF COUNT POINTS IN THE

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:32.851
PAST. BUT I THINK IT IS

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:33.952
IMPORTANT TO OBSERVE THAT THE

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:35.020
EVIDENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:36.155
THOSE WHO HAVE EXPRESSED

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.823
CONCERNS ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.124
THAT WE REALLY NEED TO MOVE

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:40.592
FORWARD IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY TO

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:42.261
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IF CAP AND

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:43.095
TRADE IS GOING TO PLAY A

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:45.764
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN OUR PATH TO

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.932
TWENTY THIRTY. THE LAST TOPIC I

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:48.534
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE CARBON

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.670
OFFSETS PROGRAM- THIS IS ALSO A

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.705
VERY CONTROVERSIAL TPIC- AND I

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:54.940
THINK A COUPLE THINGS TO SAY

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:56.942
ABOUT IT TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT-

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:58.210
THE ALSO THE PROGRAM IS OFTEN

00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:00.312
DESCRIBED AS A SMALL PART OF THE

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:01.213
CAPITATE PROGRAM. BUT THAT IS

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.182
NOT IN FACT TRUE ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:04.550
AND SIXTY MILLION FOREST CARBON

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:07.453
OFFSETS- WERE AT THEIR BOSS SETS

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:09.588
WERE USED IN THE- COMPLIANCE

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:11.123
PERIOD FOR THE FIRST. THREE

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.960
COMPLIANCE PERIODS- AND- THAT IS

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.528
IT IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:17.663
ACROSS BOTH CALIFORNIA AND

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:19.698
QUEBEC. ABOUT 80% OF THOSE

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.266
OFFSETS COME FROM THE FOREST

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:22.901
CARBON OFFSETS PROGRAM. SO WHEN

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:24.269
WE THINK ABOUT A LARGE ALLOWANCE

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:26.138
BANK AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:27.272
TWENTY ONE MILLION ALLOWANCES

00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:28.040
AND OFFSET USE IN THE

00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:29.408
NEIGHBORHOOD OF A HUNDRED SIXTY

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:30.209
MILLION ALLOWANCES. I HOPE YOU

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:31.276
CAN SEE THAT THE CONNECTION

00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:33.745
BETWEEN ABILITY THE ABILITY OF

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:34.613
COMPLIANCE ENTITIES OF THE

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.416
PROGRAM. TO RELY ON. OFFSETS AND

00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:39.351
SAVE OR NOT USE ALLOWANCES IN

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:41.587
RETURN. IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF

00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:42.988
THE SORT OF MACRO CONDITIONS

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:44.189
WERE OBSERVING WHAT THE PROGRAM

00:18:44.256 --> 00:18:48.126
MAY HAVE TOO MANY COMPLAINTS.

00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:49.094
INSTRUMENTS AT AT AT PRESENT. I

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:49.928
WANT TO DISCUSS THREE PER. THAT

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:51.830
ARE REFERENCED IN THE CHAPTER-

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:53.932
WHICH BOTH ADDRESSES THESE

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:55.000
TECHNICAL CONCERNS WITH THE

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:56.268
PERFORMANCE OF THE FOREST

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:57.836
OFFSETS PROGRAM. THAT MAKES A

00:18:57.903 --> 00:18:58.704
NUMBER OF STRUCTURAL

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.205
RECOMMENDATIONS POLICYMAKERS

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:01.773
COULD CONSIDER TO MAKE BIG

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.041
PICTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:04.376
PROGRAM IF THEY AGREE WITH THESE

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:07.312
CONCERNS. THE THREE PROBLEMS ARE

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:08.814
THE FACT THAT THERE APPEAR TO BE

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:10.616
SOME PROJECTS PARTICIPATING IN

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:11.717
THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CLAIMING

00:19:11.783 --> 00:19:12.918
CREDIT FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:15.487
ACTIVITIES. IT IS DIFFICULT TO

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:17.456
PRECISELY IDENTIFY WHICHAND HOW

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:19.424
MANY BECAUSE- THE QUESTION OF

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:20.359
WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY IS

00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:21.426
TAKING CREDIT FOR BUSINESS AS

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:22.961
USUAL IS HARD TO DETERMINE

00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:24.796
DEFINITIVELY. BUT THERE'S BEEN

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:26.398
SOME SIGNIFICANT REPORTING THAT

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.467
SUGGESTS LARGE PROJECTS IN THE

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:29.268
SYSTEM MAY IN FACT BE DOING

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:32.037
THIS. THERE IS DOCUMENTED PEER

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:33.639
REVIEWED EVIDENCE FROM A STUDY

00:19:33.705 --> 00:19:35.207
THAT I PARTICIPATED IN THAT WE

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:37.142
DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT. ABOUT

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:38.677
HOW PERHAPS AS MANY AS ONE OUT

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:40.345
OF THREE OF THE CREDITS ISSUED

00:19:40.412 --> 00:19:41.813
TO THE FOREST OFFSET PROJECTS DO

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.015
NOT REFLECT REAL CLIMATE

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:44.683
BENEFITS. AS A RESULT OF

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.318
WEAKNESSES IN THE PROGRAM RULES

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:49.755
THAT- PARTICIPANTS IN THE

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:50.622
PROGRAM ARE FINANCIALLY

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.157
ARBITRAGE. AND THE REPORT ALSO

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:53.892
DISCUSSES A NUMBER OF CONCERNS

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:55.460
RELATED TO THE PERMANENCE OF

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.095
CARBON CLAIMS BEING MADE BEFORE

00:19:57.162 --> 00:19:58.497
THE FOREST OFFSETS. ALL

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:00.065
CALIFORNIANS KNOW THE WILDFIRES

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.667
WE'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THE LAST

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:03.168
TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN RECORD

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:04.102
BREAKING. UNFORTUNATELY THOSE

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:05.971
FIRES ALSO HIT QUITE A FEW LARGE

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.573
OFFSET PROJECTS AND WE ARE

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:08.807
LOOKING AT PERHAPS SOMETHING ON

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.909
THE ORDER OF THE SHIFT. OF THE

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:12.244
STATE'S INSURANCE PROGRAM OR ITS

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:13.579
SO CALLED BUFFER POOL FOR

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:14.913
PROTECTING THE PERMANENCE OF

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.449
THESE FORESTS CARBON CLAIMS. MAY

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:18.784
HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE FIRES AND

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.185
I THINK IT RAISES SIGNIFICANT

00:20:20.252 --> 00:20:21.253
CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.155
THIS PROGRAM IS PREPARED TO MAKE

00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:23.956
THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE

00:20:24.022 --> 00:20:25.991
REQUIRED. TO MAKE A FOREST

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.392
CARBON CLAIM RESEMBLE ANYTHING

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:28.627
RESEMBLING THE ON GOING

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:30.495
COMMISSIONS. THE LAST THING I

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:31.863

CRITICAL STUDIES PUT OUT OUR

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:38.503
WORK IN PUBLIC ABOUT TEN MONTHS

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.139
AGO WE- SHARED OPENLY WITH DATA

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:42.874
AND METHODS. THAT WERE

00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:44.476

PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS OF THE

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:55.053
GOVERNMENT. TEN MONTHS LATER WE

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.555
DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING IN

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:58.657
THE WAY OF SUBSTANTIVE CRITIQUES

00:20:58.724 --> 00:20:59.725
FROM FOLKS WHO DISAGREE WITH THE

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:02.327

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:03.929
AND HAS BEEN ACCEPTED INTO THE

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.464
ACADEMIC LITERATURE AND I JUST

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:06.665
WANT TO FLAG. THE PRIMARY

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:08.333
RESPONSE I'VE RECEIVED FROM CARB

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:13.505
HOMINEM AND FALSE ATTACKS ABOUT

THE CLAIM THAT I FALSELY

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:16.274
PARTICIPATED IN LITIGATION

00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:18.276
AGAINST THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD.

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:19.511
THIS CRITICISM HAS BEEN REPEATED

AGAINST ME AND MY CO AUTHORS IT

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:23.415
IS A FALSE CRITICISM- AND IT'S

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:24.549
REALLY DISTURBING TO ME AS

00:25:51.783 --> 00:25:53.685
ESSENTIAL WE FOLLOWED THE STEP

00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:56.755
WISE APPROACH. VERY IMPORTANTLY

00:25:56.821 --> 00:25:57.956
ANY CHANGES WOULD HAVE TO BE

00:25:58.023 --> 00:25:59.524
CONSISTENT WITH STATUTORY

00:25:59.591 --> 00:26:01.393
REQUIREMENTS AND WHEN IT COMES

00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:03.228
TO CAP AND TRADE OR ANY OTHER

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:03.728
PROGRAM CODE INSIDE BY

00:26:03.795 --> 00:26:06.064
LEGISLATION. WE SEE OUR ROLE IS

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:08.600
IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM BASED

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:11.469
ON STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS.

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:12.070
EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT LAYS

00:26:12.137 --> 00:26:13.238
OUT MANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:14.205
CAP AND TRADE AND THE

00:26:14.272 --> 00:26:16.374
ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSED ON

00:26:16.441 --> 00:26:18.810
IMPLEMENTING THOSE REQUIREMENTS

00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:20.145
. WE MENTION IN THE TWENTY

00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:21.880
TWENTY LETTER TO CHAT WHY CASKEY

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:23.048
THAT WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE

00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:24.816
LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY AREAS

00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:26.217
BRAND NEW LEGISLATION COULD

00:26:26.284 --> 00:26:27.953
FURTHER THE SUCCESSFUL

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:29.354
IMPLEMENTATION OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:31.323
CLIMATE STRATEGY. I HOPE WE CAN

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:33.291
ENGAGE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS ONCE

00:26:33.358 --> 00:26:35.026
WE HAVE A SENSE THROUGH THE

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:35.961
SCOPING PLAN OF AREAS WHERE

00:26:36.027 --> 00:26:37.796
LEGISLATION WILL BE THE MOST

00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:39.965
NEED IT. J. ROUNDUP WILL GO INTO

00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:41.433
DETAIL ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:44.035
IN THE IRON MASK FOR PAUL LET ME

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:44.836
BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF

00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:46.905
TOPICS. AS WE HAD FROM THE

00:26:46.972 --> 00:26:48.873
PREVIOUS BECAUSE THE I. IMAC

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:49.374
TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.109
PROVIDES RECOMMENDATIONS FOCUS

00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:52.510
ON THE SCOPING PLAN ALLOWANCE

00:26:52.577 --> 00:26:54.646
BANKING ADMISSIONS MARKET DESIGN

00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:57.215
AND PROGRAM REFORM. CARBON

OFFSETS AND EMISSION LEAKAGE

00:26:59.217 --> 00:27:00.585
MIDDAY AND MITIGATION MEASURES

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:01.686
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE

00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:03.455
EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND THOUGHT

00:27:03.521 --> 00:27:05.490
PROVOKING AND I SHOULD I CAN

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:07.459
ASSURE THE EMAIL MEMBERS AND THE

00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:09.094
SENATORS ON THIS COMMITTEE THEY

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.895
WERE CAREFULLY CONSIDERING EACH

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:11.863
OF THEM WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.398
THE DELIVERY. PROCESS I

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:15.500
DESCRIBED EARLIER. I REALLY

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:16.601
SPOKE ABOUT THE SKILL BEING

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:18.236
PLANNED SO LET'S BRIEFLY DISCUSS

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:21.139
UNUSED ALLOWANCES AND LEAKAGE.

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:22.440
ON UNUSED ALLOWANCES WE AGREE

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:24.242
WITH THE I AM BACK THE ISSUE

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:25.944
NEEDS TO BE SAID THE STUDY. IS

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:28.113
DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW

00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:29.414
MANY UNUSED ALLOWANCES ARE

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:36.721
APPROPRIATE AND ACCEPTABLE. THIS

00:27:36.788 --> 00:27:37.989
IS HOW MANY WOULD BE TOO MANY.

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:40.025
WHAT I SUGGEST IS COPPER BACK

00:27:40.091 --> 00:27:41.192
THE LEFT OF. THE END OF TWENTY

00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:41.793
TWENTY THREE. DURING THE STATE

OF THE- FOR AND IT NEST. SHOULD

00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:44.662
YOUR LEADS LET JUST CHANGES TO

00:27:44.729 --> 00:27:45.797
INITIAL THE NUMBER OF ALLOW. IN

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:47.899
THE SYSTEM IS APPROPRIATE. WHICH

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:49.434
SUGGESTS THE END OF TWENTY

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:50.869
TWENTY THREE BECAUSE BY THE END

00:27:50.935 --> 00:27:52.971

OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE WORKSHOPS ON

00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:03.882
THE TOPIC BEFORE COMING BACK TO

THE LEGISLATURE. AND HE BRIEFLY

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.085
TO ON THE ISSUE OF LEAKAGE THIS

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:08.753
IS WHY ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.922
ASSOCIATED EMISSIONS SHIFT FROM

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:12.023

LESS STRINGENTLY ALL NOT AT ALL.

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:20.565
WHAT'S DIFFICULT TO TRACK THE

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:21.166
POSSIBILITY OF LEAKAGE IN THE

00:28:21.232 --> 00:28:23.301
SYSTEM. A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:25.403
DOES HAVE GUARDRAILS IN PLACE TO

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.505
PREVENT LEAKAGE. WE ALSO WORK

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:29.607
VERY HARD TO EXPLORE I. GHG

SPECIFIC REGULATIONS MORE

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:17.595
IMPORTANTLY SPECIFIC CHANGES TO

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:20.531
EXISTING REGULATIONS. IT'S AFTER

00:33:20.598 --> 00:33:22.400
FINALIZING THIS CABIN PLAN THAT

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:24.268
CARP AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES

THREE FIFTY- AND WHICH I WORKED

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:44.555
ON QUITE A BIT IN MY PREVIOUS

00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:45.857
ROLE. THE IMS RECOMMENDATIONS

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:48.059
ARE GENERALLY AT THIS LEVEL OF

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:50.294
POLICY DEVELOPMENT. AND ARE

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:53.297
ABOUT A SPECIFIC REGULATION. CAP

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:57.769
AND TRADE. WELL I'M NOT GONNA GO

00:33:57.835 --> 00:33:59.337
THROUGH EVERY BULLET ON THE

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:00.671
SLIDE I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT

00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:03.474
THERE IS- A ROBUST PUBLIC

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:04.742
PROCESS THAT CARBON AT THEIR

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:07.044
AGENCIES FOLLOW WHEN WE DEVELOP

00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:09.447
REGULATIONS. WE ARE WORK IS

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:10.848
GOVERNED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:34:10.915 --> 00:34:12.617
PROCEDURES ACT WHICH PROVIDES

00:34:12.683 --> 00:34:14.051
THE PUBLIC WITH THE OPPORTUNITY

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:15.486
TO PARTICIPATE AND INCREASE

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:17.622
PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT FORMAL NOTICE

00:34:17.688 --> 00:34:20.992
SAYS REGULATORY TAXED. AND SOME

00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:23.027
REGULATORY ACTIONS ALSO REQUIRE

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:24.962
AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THROUGH THE

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:26.964
DEVELOPMENT OF A STANDARDIZED

00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:28.599
REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT OR

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:31.135
SYRIA. WHICH IS REQUIRED WHEN AN

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:32.870
AGENCY ESTIMATES THAT A PROPOSED

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:34.539
REGULATION HAS AN ECONOMIC

00:34:34.605 --> 00:34:36.274
IMPACT EXCEEDING FIFTY MILLION

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.708
DOLLARS. AND THIS IS

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:39.043
PARTICULARLY RELEVANT WHEN

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.745
CONSIDERING CHANGES TO CAP AND

00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:42.914
TRADE BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.449
DIRECTED CAR TO ACHIEVE THE

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:46.818
MAXIMUM TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE

00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:49.754
AND COST EFFECTIVE GHG EMISSIONS

00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:56.327
REDUCTION. SEVERAL STEPS IN THIS

00:34:56.394 --> 00:34:58.196
PROCESS REQUIRE US TO ASSESS

00:34:58.262 --> 00:34:59.597
ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.699
ACTIONS AND TO ASSESS BOTH THE

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:04.602
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:08.306
IMPACTS OF THOSE AUTHENTICATES.

00:35:08.372 --> 00:35:10.308
SO I'M NOW INTERESTED IRAQ'S

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:12.076
MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR MOST

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:14.412
RECENT REPORT. THEIR FIRST

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:15.513
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.114
SCOPING PLAN SHOULD EXAMINE

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:19.517
PROGRESS TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:22.386
CLIMATE TARGET. AS DISCUSSED

00:35:22.453 --> 00:35:25.323
EARLIER WE AGREE AT THE TWENTY

00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:26.424
TWENTY TO SCOPING PLAN UPDATE

00:35:26.491 --> 00:35:28.860
WILL ASSESS PROGRESS TOWARDS THE

00:35:28.926 --> 00:35:30.294
TWENTY THIRTY TARGET IDENTIFIED

00:35:30.361 --> 00:35:31.596
THE NEED FOR POTENTIAL

00:35:31.662 --> 00:35:33.965
ADJUSTMENTS TO STAY ON TRACK AND

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:35.666
LAY OUT A PATH TO ACHIEVE CARBON

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:39.036
NEUTRALITY NO LATER THAN TWENTY

00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:40.404
FORTY FIVE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:41.639
SCOPING PLAN HAS A LONGER

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:43.107
PLANNING HORIZON THAN PREVIOUS

00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:45.643
SCOPING PLAN. WHICH BEST FITS A

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:47.111
GREATER FOCUS ON THE OUTCOMES

00:35:47.178 --> 00:35:49.347
NEEDED TO ACHIEVE GHG EMISSIONS

00:35:49.413 --> 00:35:51.949
REDUCTIONS. THE PLAN WILL FOCUS

00:35:52.016 --> 00:35:53.351
ON OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:56.053
TECHNOLOGIES FUELS ENERGY

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.356
SOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:35:58.422 --> 00:35:59.690
WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO

00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:01.492
TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:03.361
FUELS BY MID CENTURY. THE

00:36:03.427 --> 00:36:04.962
RESULTS OF SCENARIO MODELING

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:06.764
WILL ALSO BE USED TO EVALUATE

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.633
THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:09.901
BENEFITS OF THE DIFFERENT

00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:11.736
SCENARIOS. THIS COPING PLAN

00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:13.204
PROVIDES AN ECONOMY WIDE

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:15.273
FRAMEWORK SPANNING MANY YEARS

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:17.341
AND THEREFORE AS NOTED EARLIER

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:18.943
DOES NOT DELVE INTO THE DESIGN

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.711

OR REGULATIONS. NOR DOES IT

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:24.549
SUPPLANT OR CREATE NEW STATUTES

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:26.551
AND REGULATIONS. THOSE

00:36:26.617 --> 00:36:36.394
ACTIVITIES WILL OCCUR SEPARATELY. THIS WILL ANALYZE OUR PROGRESS

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.230
TOWARDS THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET

00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:40.731
- AND THE BOARD ASSESSED THE

00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:43.234
ISSUE A BANK ALLOWANCES IN OUR

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:44.802
TWENTY EIGHTEEN RULEMAKING. AND

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:46.804
IS ALSO PREPARING A REPORT-

BANK ALLOWANCES AND WHETHER OR

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:55.012
NOT THEY ARE HINDERING PROGRESS

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:57.548
TOWARDS- TWENTY THIRTY CALLS.

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:59.417
SOME ACTORS SOME ECONOMISTS HAVE

00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:00.585
STUDIED WHO HAVE STUDIED THE

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:02.687
PROGRAM HAD HAVE ADVISED THAT

00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:04.922
ARTIFICIALLY REMOVING UNUSED

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:08.092
ALLOWANCES NOW. COULD ONLY SERVE

00:37:08.159 --> 00:37:09.060
TO INCREASE PRICES IN THE

00:37:09.126 --> 00:37:10.728
PROGRAM WITHOUT CLEAR

00:37:10.795 --> 00:37:12.229
CORRESPONDING EMISSIONS

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:15.433
REDUCTION BENEFITS. HOWEVER AS

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:16.801
AS THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:18.936
DISCUSSED WE MUST CONSIDER ANY

00:37:19.003 --> 00:37:22.707
NUMBER OF THINGS ALLOWANCES IN

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:23.708
THE CONTEXT OF THE COMPLETE

PROGRAM. END DATE AND THE DESIGN

00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:28.546
OF THE PROGRAM OVER THE YEARS.

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:30.348
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE STRENGTHEN

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:31.949
THE SELF RATCHETING MECHANISM SO

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:34.051
THAT ALLOWANCES AND SOLD FOR

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:35.453
EIGHT AUCTIONS WOULD BE REMOVED

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:36.621
INTO THE ALLOW ITS PRICE

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:38.589
CONTAINMENT RESERVE. THROUGH

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:40.324
THIS MECHANISM MORE THAN THIRTY

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:42.727
SEVEN MILLION ALLOWANCES WERE

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:43.995
ALREADY MOVED INTO THE RESEARCH

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:45.529
. IN ADDITION IN SETTING THE

00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:49.266
ALLOWANCE BUDGETS 421-202-1220

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:50.368
THIRTY WE REFLECTED THE FACT

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:52.436
THAT WE HAD ACHIEVED A TWENTY

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:54.138
TWENTY TARGET EARLY BY REMOVING

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:55.406
ALLOWANCES FROM GENERAL

00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:57.308
CIRCULATION AND PLACING THEM IN

00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:59.577
RESEARCH. ALSO AMENDED THE

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:01.212
REGULATION TO PERMANENTLY REMOVE

00:38:01.278 --> 00:38:02.546
ALLOWANCES FOR GENERAL

00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:04.782
CIRCULATION TO REFLECT CHANGES

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:05.916
TO THE ASSET USAGE LIMIT

00:38:05.983 --> 00:38:08.986
ESTABLISHED BY EIGHTY THREE

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:10.321
NINETY EIGHT. I'M GONNA BRIEFLY

00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:12.523
TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THE EIGHTY

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.124
THREE NINETY EIGHT CHANGES TO

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.227
THE PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE

00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:18.362
A DIRECT BEARING ON THIS ISSUE.

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:20.398
BUT I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT.

00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:21.966
THIS WORK DEMONSTRATES THAT WE

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:23.668
WILL MAKE CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:25.936
WHEN NECESSARY INCLUDING

00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:27.038
REMOVING ALLOWANCES FROM THE

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:28.773
GENERAL POOL TO BETTER ALIGN

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:30.474
WITH PROGRAM PERFORMANCE. BASED

00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:35.146
ON. CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND A

00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:36.847
REGULATORY PROCESS THAT IS

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:40.451
CONSISTENTLY STATUTE. WHEN WE

00:38:40.518 --> 00:38:42.186
TALK ABOUT POTENTIAL CHANGES TO

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:43.788
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WE

00:38:43.854 --> 00:38:45.489
MUST NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM HAS

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:47.258
CHANGED A LOT AS OF JANUARY

00:38:47.324 --> 00:38:50.561
FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND MOST

00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:51.162
OF THOSE CHANGES WERE MANDATED

00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:53.097
BY EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT. AS

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:55.332
PART OF THE PROGRAM GOING OUT TO

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:56.534
TWENTY THIRTY WE SET OUR CATS TO

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.302
REFLECT THE FACT THAT THE TWENTY

00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:00.438
THIRTY GOALS ESTABLISHED BY SP

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.206
THIRTY TWO IS STEEPER THAN THE

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:03.874
TWENTY TWENTY GOAL. AS A RESULT

00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:06.010
THE CAT SMITH FROM ABOUT 2% PER

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:08.145
YEAR FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:10.147
TWENTY TWENTY. TWO ABOUT 4% PER

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:14.351
YEAR FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO

00:39:14.418 --> 00:39:15.386
TWENTY. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:16.787
REQUIRED US TO SET A PRICE

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.656
CEILING STARTING IN JANUARY

00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:20.057
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THAT IS

00:39:20.124 --> 00:39:22.059
NOW SET AT SEVENTY TWO DOLLARS

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:24.328
AND TWENTY NINE CENTS IN TWENTY

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.097
TWENTY TWO. WHICH LIKE THE PRICE

00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:28.766
FLOOR GOES UP BY 5% PLUS

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:31.869
INFLATION EVERY YEAR. AB THREE

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:32.970
NINETY EIGHT ALSO REQUIRED US TO

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.472
REDESIGN THE ALLOWANCE PRICE

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.207
CONTAINMENT RESERVE WHICH SERVES

00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:37.742
AS AN IMPORTANT COST CONTAINMENT

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:39.376
OF THE PROGRAM. TO HAVE TWO

00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:42.113
TIERS. THESE TEARS ARE PARKED AT

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:45.015
THE 50% AND 75% MARK BETWEEN THE

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:46.117
PRICE FLOOR AND THE PRICE

00:39:46.183 --> 00:39:48.853
CEILING WHICH THIS YEAR ARE AT

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:50.387

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:56.327
AND AGAIN THESE ALSO GO UP 5%

00:39:56.393 --> 00:39:59.363
PLUS INFLATION. AB THREE NINETY

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.865
EIGHT ALSO REQUIRED A 1100%

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:03.167
LEAKAGE ASSISTANCE FACTOR TO BE

APPLIED TO ALL INDUSTRIAL

00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:07.404
SOURCES. AND LASTLY AB THREE

00:40:07.471 --> 00:40:08.105
NINETY EIGHT SUBSTANTIALLY

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:09.607
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS THAT

00:40:09.673 --> 00:40:12.710
REGULATED ENTITIES CAN USE FROM

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:14.111
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:16.213
THIRTY. FROM 8% 24% AND A HALF

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.583
THAT 4% MUST PROVIDE DIRECT

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.050
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:22.353
CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE ALL

00:40:22.419 --> 00:40:23.621
DIFFERENT CONDITIONS FROM THE

00:40:23.687 --> 00:40:25.456
FIRST THREE COMPLIANCE PERIODS

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:27.892
OF THE PROGRAM. BOASTS BOTH IN

00:40:27.958 --> 00:40:29.393
TERMS OF BEING MORE STRINGENT

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.262
BUT ALSO MAKE CHANGES TO CONTAIN

00:40:31.328 --> 00:40:33.898
PRICES AND AVOID MAKING. AND

00:40:33.964 --> 00:40:35.166
IMPORTANTLY WE DON'T KNOW YET

00:40:35.232 --> 00:40:37.368
WHAT THE FULL IMPACT OF THESE

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:40.838
CHANGES WILL BE ON THE LINE. I

00:40:40.905 --> 00:40:42.406
AM NOT A REPORT ALSO INCLUDED

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:44.408
RECOMMENDATIONS ON ADJUSTING THE

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:46.143
AMOUNT SUPPLY IN RESPONSE TO

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.078
ACTUALLY HELP COMES. EFFECTIVELY

00:40:48.145 --> 00:40:49.413
ENHANCING THE MARKET'S PRICE

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.981
FLOOR BY ADDING AN ADDITIONAL

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:52.416
EMISSIONS CONTAINMENT RESERVE

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:54.852
PRICE STEP. AS EXISTS IN OTHER

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:56.253
NORTH AMERICAN EMISSIONS TRADING

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.622
PROGRAMS AS DALLAS DESCRIBED

00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:02.092
EARLIER. AS I JUST DESCRIBED ON

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:03.394
THE PREVIOUS SLIDE THE

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.895
LEGISLATURE WAITING THROUGH THE

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:06.864
PASSAGE OF AB THREE NINETY EIGHT

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.432
ON THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM.

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:09.900
AND MANY OF THOSE CHANGES

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:11.202
INCLUDING REINFORCING THE

00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:12.570
REGULATORY MECHANISM FOR

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:14.405
REMOVING ALLOWANCES WHEN THERE

00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:16.106
IS LOW DEMAND AT AUCTION. AND

00:41:16.173 --> 00:41:17.975
ESTABLISHING THE TWO NEW PRICE

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:19.610
CONTAINMENT RESERVE TEARS AND

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:21.779
CRIES FEELING TOOK A BACK TOOK

00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:23.914
EFFECT FULLY LAST YEAR. AND WE

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.783
HAVE LIMITED DATA ON THE IMPACT

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.852
OF THOSE CHANGES. AND WE WILL

00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:31.188
ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE TO ASSESS

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:32.389
AND ADJUST AS NEEDED. THE

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:34.291
PROGRAM HAS SUPPORTED A STEADILY

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:36.627
INCREASING PRICING NOW AS NOTED

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:38.395
ON THE SLIDE. WHICH HAS SEEN

00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:40.097
PERIODS OF BOTH LOW AND HIGH

00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:42.600
DEMAND INCLUDING A SCENE IN

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:45.069
RECENT AUCTIONS. I'D ALSO LIKE

00:41:45.135 --> 00:41:46.370
TO KNOW THAT WE MUST ALWAYS

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:48.005
CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:49.707
METRICS TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:41:49.773 --> 00:41:51.909
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM. FOR

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:53.444
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THOSE

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.045
METRICS MUST INCLUDE REVEALING

00:41:55.112 --> 00:41:57.047
HOW EMISSIONS AND CRISIS FOR

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:58.682
ALLOWANCES ARE CHANGING OVER

00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:04.989
TIME. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:06.824
IMF RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:10.361
ASSETS AS I NOTED A B. THIRTY

00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:11.161
THREE NINETY EIGHT CUT THE ASSET

00:42:11.228 --> 00:42:14.865
LIMIT IN HALF 24% IN RESPONSE TO

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:16.867
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS.

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:19.470
AND THAT WILL ADJUST 26% WE HAVE

00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:20.871
CONDUCTED PERIODIC REVIEWS OF

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:23.574
OUR OFFSET PROTOCOLS AND UPDATED

00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:26.610
THEM BASED ON THE LATEST SCIENCE

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:29.413
. CARB HAS RESPONDED TO SOME OF

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.215
THE ACADEMIC CONCERNS RELATED TO

00:42:31.282 --> 00:42:33.817
FOREST ASSET PROTOCOL AND AS

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:34.919
USUAL WE ARE CONSTANTLY

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:36.487
REVIEWING YOU DATED THAT MAY

00:42:36.553 --> 00:42:38.522
WARRANT TECHNICAL UPDATES IN

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:40.591
OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE I

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:42.593
DIRECTED CARDS STAFF TO START

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.495
HOLDING WORKSHOPS THIS SUMMER TO

00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:46.230
EVALUATE THE LATEST SCIENCE FOR

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.532
ANY POTENTIAL PROGRAM UPDATE.

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.100
AND TO DISCUSS THE CONCERNS

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:52.536
RAISED ON THE FOREST OFFSET

00:42:52.603 --> 00:42:54.972
PROTOCOL. ONE THING I WANT TO

00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:56.907
TOUCH ON BEFORE WE MOVE ON IT IS

00:42:56.974 --> 00:42:59.410
THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRES ON

00:42:59.476 --> 00:43:02.079
FORESTS ASSET PROJECTS. THIS IS

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:04.281
CLEARLY A SERIOUS ISSUE AS

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:06.417
CLIMATE CHANGE EXACERBATES OUR

00:43:06.483 --> 00:43:09.219
WILDFIRE PROBLEM. WE FORESAW THE

00:43:09.286 --> 00:43:10.821
POSSIBILITY OF WHAT WE CALL OUR

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:13.023
FIRST CELLS DUE TO WILDFIRE AND

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.125
OTHER DISTURBANCES SUCH AS PEST

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:17.227
INFESTATION WHEN THE OFFSET

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:19.396
PROGRAM IS DESIGNED. TO FORCE

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:20.864
OFFSET PROTOCOL TAKES INTO

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:22.833
ACCOUNT THESE RISK FACTORS BASED

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.735
ON THE BEST AVAILABLE DATA FROM

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:27.037
WHEN THE PROTOCOL WAS ADOPTED

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:28.672
AND LATER AMENDED. BASED ON THE

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:30.674
RISK FACTORS A PROJECT SPECIFIC

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:32.609
PERCENTAGE DISCOUNT DETERMINES

00:43:32.676 --> 00:43:34.244
THE NUMBER OF CREDIT SATISFIED

00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:36.046
INTO THE FOREST BUFFER ACCOUNT

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:37.414
WHICH SERVES AS AN INSURANCE

00:43:37.481 --> 00:43:40.217
MECHANISM TO ENSURE PERMANENT.

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:42.152
TYPICALLY EACH PROJECT THAT IS

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.921
ISSUED CARBON OFFSET CREDITS

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:45.689
CONTRIBUTES BETWEEN SEVENTEEN

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:47.958
AND 19% OF THEIR TOTAL CREDIT

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:50.060
INTO THE BUFFER ACCOUNT. IN THE

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:52.029
EVENT OF A WILDFIRE DESTROYING

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:54.031
PART OF A PROJECT WE ESTIMATE

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:55.399
THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:58.202
REDUCTIONS LAST AND REQUIRE ANY

00:43:58.268 --> 00:44:00.104
SORRY RETIRE AND EQUIVALENT

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.572
AMOUNT OF ASSETS FROM THE BUFFER

00:44:01.638 --> 00:44:03.741
POOL TO MAINTAINING

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:04.341
ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY OF THE

00:44:04.408 --> 00:44:06.810
PROGRAM. SINCE OUR PROTOCOL

00:44:06.877 --> 00:44:08.178
APPLIES TO PROJECTS ACROSS THE

00:44:08.245 --> 00:44:09.880
COUNTRY THERE IS A WIDE VARIETY

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:11.782
OF FOREST TYPES AND LOCATIONS

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:14.184
CONTRIBUTING TO THE BUFFER POOL.

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.652
APPROXIMATELY THIRTY MILLION

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:16.954
CREDITS HAVE BEEN A TRICK

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:18.989
CONTRIBUTED TO THE PARK FOREST

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:21.258
BUFFER POOL TO DATE WITH EACH

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:23.193
NEW PROJECT CONTINUING TO

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.696
CONTRIBUTE. APPROXIMATELY ONE

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:28.165
POINT ONE MILLION CREDITS OR

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:31.068
LESS THAN 4% HAVE BEEN RETIRED

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:33.103
FROM THE FORCE AFTER ACCOUNT TO

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.906
DATE TO ACCOUNT FOR INVOLUNTARY

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:38.675
REVERSALS. THIS MEANS TO THE

00:44:38.742 --> 00:44:40.277
EXTENT THAT PROJECTS DO NOT FACE

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:42.246
REVERSAL EVENTS THE PROGRAM

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:43.881
ACHIEVES MORE REDUCTIONS THAT

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:45.349
ARE PRESENTED IN THE ASSETS

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:48.352
PRODUCE. AS I NOTED WE WILL BE

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:49.720
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE LATEST

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:51.388
SCIENCE AS PART OF THE STAFF

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:53.424
WORKSHOPS THAT WILL BE CONVENED

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.793
LATER THIS SUMMER INCLUDING A

00:44:55.859 --> 00:45:00.564
DISCUSSION. OF WILDFIRE RISKS.

00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:02.132
FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:03.200
RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:05.069
KIDS IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:07.137
THAT EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT

00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:08.572
MANDATES THE LEAKAGE ASSISTANCE

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:09.740
FACTOR FOR ALL INDUSTRIAL

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:11.475
SOLUTIONS GOING FORWARD. AND

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:13.644
CARBS OUTPUT BASED ALLOCATION

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.613
METHODOLOGY FOR INDUSTRY IS

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.248
BASED ON ACTUAL UPDATING DATA.

00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:19.983
CARB HAS IDENTIFIED LEAKAGE IN

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.119
THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET AND

00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:23.854
WE DO RETIRE ALLOWANCES RELATED

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:26.523
TO EM OUTSTANDING EMISSIONS TO

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.292
ADDRESS THIS LEAKAGE. I'LL NOTE

00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:30.694
THAT CAR WAS FULLY ENGAGED WITH

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.763
OTHER STATES AND STATE AGENCIES

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.865
TO IMPROVE COORDINATION AND DEEP

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:36.934
IN WESTERN ELECTRICITY MARKETS

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:37.901
WHILE ENSURING THAT WE HAVE

00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:40.971
ACCURATE GHG ACCOUNTING AND OUR

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:43.407
DRESSING LEAKAGE EIGHTY THREE

00:45:43.474 --> 00:45:44.541
NINETY EIGHT ALSO REQUIRES US TO

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:46.310
REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY THE

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:49.480
END OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ON THE

00:45:49.546 --> 00:45:53.784
LAKE IS PROPOSED BY. OKAY I'M

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:55.085
GONNA GO THROUGH THE LAST FEW

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:58.822
SLIDES FAIRLY QUICKLY- JUST TO

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:01.925
NOTE THAT- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS

00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:04.261
AS DISCUSSED EARLIER OF UPDATING

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:06.396
THE SCOPING PLAN- IT WILL LAY

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:07.698
OUT THE FOUNDATION FOR THE

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:08.966
DEVELOPMENT OF ALL OF OUR

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.567
CLIMATE REGULATIONS INCLUDING

00:46:10.634 --> 00:46:12.803
CAP AND TRADE. WILL BE ASSESSING

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.438
PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING THE

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:16.607
TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. BUT ALSO

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:18.809
RECOGNIZES THAT TWENTY THIRTY IS

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:21.845
A MILESTONE ON. WHERE RECENT

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:23.413
SCIENCE SAYS WE NEED TO BE BY

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.582
MID CENTURY SO WE CAN'T WAIT

00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:28.218
UNTIL TWENTY TWO THIRTY ONE TO

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:29.319
START PLANNING FOR TWENTY FORTY

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:29.853
FIVE BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.522
TRANSFORMATION IS NEEDED NEEDED

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:33.290
ACROSS THE ECONOMY IS

00:46:33.357 --> 00:46:35.359
UNPRECEDENTED. SO WE NEED TO

00:46:35.425 --> 00:46:37.127
LOOK FOR ACTIONS TO DEPLOY CLEAN

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:39.396
ENERGY AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGY TO

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:40.864
HIT THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET AND

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:42.633
PUT US ON A PATH TOWARD

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:46.036
DECARBONIZING. TOWARD A

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:47.471
NEUTRALITY IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:49.173
. YOU CAN'T DECOUPLE THE TWO

00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:54.845
ANNOUNCED. THIS COPING PLAN WILL

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:55.946
HAVE THE LONGEST PLANNING

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:58.215
HORIZON OF ANY PREVIOUS SCOPING

00:46:58.282 --> 00:47:00.951
PLAN. AND WE WILL PLACE A LARGER

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:02.753
FOCUS ON OUTCOMES WE IN NEED

00:47:02.819 --> 00:47:07.024
NEED TO RICHIE'S BY TWENTY FORTY

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.258
FIVE IN IDENTIFYING OUTCOMES THE

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:09.893
MODELING WILL PROVIDE PAST FOR

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.628
CLEAN TECHNOLOGY ENERGY

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:13.830
DEPLOYMENT. FOR EXAMPLE THE RATE

00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:15.165
OF SALES OF LIGHT DUTY ELECTRIC

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:18.602
VEHICLES OR ELECTRIC APPLIANCES

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.971
THESE METRICS IN ADDITION TO THE

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:24.708
ANNUAL GHG INVENTORY WILL HELP

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:27.044
US TRACK PROGRESS MOVING FORWARD

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:27.811
. THESE OUTCOMES WILL BE

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:29.546
CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:31.381
CHEATING NEAR TERMAIR QUALITY

MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF A- PRO.

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:03.767
AND ONE OF THE TO TELL. THAT HAD

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:05.836
A THERE'S A SCOPING PROCESS.

REALLY SHOULD- SHOWED WHY ON HOW

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:09.740
THE STATE REACHES ITS GREENHOUSE

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:12.175
GAS GOALS NOT JUST IN TERMS OF

00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:13.310
WHAT TECHNOLOGIES COULD BE USED

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:15.479
TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS BUT-

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:16.012
EXAMINATION OF THE POLICY

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:18.382
OPTIONS- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE-

00:50:18.448 --> 00:50:19.983
GOT A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.251
EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM DESIGN

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:23.053
CHANGE BUT- SHOULD HELP IN OUR

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.921
VIEW INFORM POLICY DISCUSSIONS

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:26.356
FOR EXAMPLE WHAT ARE THE COSTS

00:50:26.423 --> 00:50:28.158
OF DIFFERENT POLICY OPTIONS.

00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:29.326
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS HOW THOSE

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:31.027
COSTS AND BENEFITS DISTRIBUTED

00:50:31.094 --> 00:50:31.762
ACROSS DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLDS AND

00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:33.797
BUSINESSES. WHAT'S THE ROLE OF

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:35.399
CAP AND TRADE IN WHEN AND WHY

00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:36.733
MIGHT THE STATEMENT WENT OUT

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.903
OTHER. COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES.

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.171
THIS IS REALLY ONE OF THE MAIN

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:42.406
POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE

00:50:42.472 --> 00:50:43.807
SCOPING PLAN PROCESS INFORMING

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:45.075
THAT POLICY DOES POLICY AND

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:46.643
BUDGET DECISIONS FOR YOU AS A

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.112
LEGISLATURE- GOING FORWARD AND

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:50.380
UNDERSTAND THE TRADE OFFS AND WE

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:52.549
WORRY ABOUT- YOU KNOW DEPENDING

00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:53.450
ON KIND OF WHAT WHAT THAT

00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:54.317
MODELING LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT

00:50:54.384 --> 00:50:55.719
THAT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE THE

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:56.720
CURRENT APPROACH MIGHT NOT

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:58.321
PROVIDE THAT TYPE BUT NOW ALSO

00:50:58.388 --> 00:50:59.222
SO I THINK THAT'S- A LEGISLATURE

00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:00.424
MIGHT WANT TO ASK YOU

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:01.358
MINISTRATION WHETHER THAT. THAT

00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:02.926
SCOPING PLAN PROCESS WILL FOCUS

00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:04.494
ON SOME OF THOSE POLICY OPTIONS

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:06.229
AND TRADE OFFS. AND OTHER

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:07.364
EXAMINE THE ROLE OF

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:15.605
CONCENTRATING DESIGN OF. COUNTRY

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:16.673
AS PART OF THAT PROCESS. THE

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.175
SECOND. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:20.043
THE ISSUE ALLOWANCE- AND WE

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:21.478
THINK IT'S A- HELPFUL TO HER.

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:22.913
KIND OF AN AGREED. PUBLIC MET.

00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:23.880
FOR THE SIZE OF THE ALLOWANCE

00:51:23.947 --> 00:51:25.115
BANK. WHICH THREE HUNDRED TWENTY

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:27.117
ONE MILLION TONNE. THERE TO

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:28.051
TWENTY- MAKE A JUDGMENT ABOUT

00:51:28.118 --> 00:51:29.252
THE- TO WHICH SETS UP. AS MUCH

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:31.488
MORE TO. IN THE ON A LOT OF

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:32.122
REQUESTS. FOR EXAMPLE WHAT THE

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:34.157
PRIMARY GOAL OF THE PROGRAM AS-

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:35.392
WHETHER THE PROGRAM WILL

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:37.661
CONTINUE DOWN TWENTY THIRTY. BUT

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:39.196
SOME OF THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

00:51:39.262 --> 00:51:40.096
HIGHLIGHTED IN THE REPORT ARE

00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:42.499
CONSISTENT WITH RESPECT WE- AT

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:44.201
B. L. L. AT HIGHLIGHTED SEVERAL

00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:45.702
YEARS AGO ABOUT THE SUPPLY OF

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.237
ALLOWANCES NOT. NOT BEING

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:48.638
CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:49.306
LEGISLATURE'S TWENTY THIRTY

00:51:49.372 --> 00:51:51.508
GOALS. AND SO IN OTHER WORDS

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:53.143
WITHOUT CHANGES WE DEFEND AS

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.411
CURRENTLY DESIGNED THERE'S A

00:51:54.478 --> 00:51:56.213
VERY REAL REST OF THE PROGRAM.

00:51:56.279 --> 00:51:57.047
DOESN'T DRIVE EMISSION

00:51:57.113 --> 00:51:58.315
REDUCTIONS THE STATE IS COMING

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:00.250
ON TO ME THAT'S A TWENTY THIRTY

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:01.918
G. ISSUE GOALS. SO AS A RESULT

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:03.019
WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:04.254
A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:05.388
ADJUSTMENTS ARE NEEDED AND WHAT

00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:10.260
THE TRADE OFFS MIGHT DEAL. WITH

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:11.161
SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENT

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:12.128
ADJUSTMENTS. SO THE COMMITTEE MY

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:13.497
- ADMINISTRATION. THANKS THE

00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:16.800
ALLOW BANKERS IT IS A RE RISK- I

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:18.268
. THINK I HEARD SECRETARY BLOOM

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:19.202
KILLED MANY. AND REPORTING BACK

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:19.903
ON THE ALLOWANCE THANK BY THE

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.138
END OF TWENTY TWENTY-ONE KEY

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:25.709
QUESTION IS THAT A VALUATION-

00:52:25.775 --> 00:52:28.712
TOO LATE- SOMETIMES- REGULATORY

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:30.747
PROCESS CAN TAKE. A YEAR OR TWO

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.616
AND SO- THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT

00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:33.517
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ON THE

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:36.353
SIZE OF THE BANK NOW. AND YOU

00:52:36.419 --> 00:52:37.554
WAIT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:40.190
TWENTY TWENTIES- YOU COULD MAKE

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:41.291
IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE STATE

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:45.161
TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN TIME TO

00:52:45.228 --> 00:52:46.096
MEET ITS TWENTY THIRTY GOALS.

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:47.163
THE THIRD- AND FINALISED I

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.932
REALLY HIGHLIGHT IS JUSTICE OF A

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:50.133
MARKER OF. SO TO FIX THE

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.968
LEGISLATURE. AGREES THAT THERE

00:52:52.035 --> 00:52:53.803
IS A PROBLEM WITH THE PROGRAM

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.772
STRINGENCY AND THAT THERE ARE.

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:56.773
THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.375
POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR CHANGES

00:52:58.441 --> 00:53:00.076
SOME. THEY ALL REQUIRE CAREFUL

00:53:00.143 --> 00:53:01.645
THOUGHT AND DESIGN AND I'M NOT

00:53:01.711 --> 00:53:03.580
GOING TO GO INTO ALL OF THEM IN

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:04.314
DETAIL. BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:06.449
A COUPLE OF KEY THOUGHTS AGAIN

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:07.984
REITERATING SOME OF THE THINGS

00:53:08.051 --> 00:53:09.753
THAT ARE IN THE- REPORT. ONE IS

00:53:09.819 --> 00:53:11.321
THAT WE AGREE THAT IT'S BETTER

00:53:11.388 --> 00:53:12.856
TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:14.958
SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES AND KIND OF

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:17.627
A RULE BASED MANNER SO- YOU KNOW

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:19.329
SETTING UP RULES AND CRITERIA.

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:21.531
CLEARLY AND PUBLICLY ON KIND OF

00:53:21.598 --> 00:53:22.866
WHEN ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:24.668
AND WHY IT RATHER THAN KIND OF

00:53:24.734 --> 00:53:26.269
AN AD HOC BASIS WE THINK THAT.

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:28.004
HELPS PROVIDE A GREATER MARKET

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:31.107
CERTAINTY- AND THE ADJUSTMENTS

00:53:31.174 --> 00:53:32.175
WE THINK SHOULD BE MADE WITH THE

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:33.543
LEGISLATURE'S CLIMATE GOALS IN

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.179
MIND SORT OF FOCUS ON- KIND OF

00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:36.846
WHAT THE MISSION GOALS.

00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:38.548
PRODUCING EMISSIONS IN A WAY

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:39.182
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:42.018
GOALS. ARE IT IS IMPORTANT AS MY

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:43.620
COLLEAGUE- COLLEAGUES HAVE

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:45.288
MENTIONED THAT ADJUSTMENTS COULD

00:53:45.355 --> 00:53:47.724
RESULT IN. HIGHER PRICES WHICH

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.392
DOES HAVE A STRAIGHT OFF OF

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:50.927
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS

00:53:50.994 --> 00:53:52.329
OF HIGHER HOUSEHOLD ENERGY COSTS

00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:54.931
FOR EXAMPLE- HOWEVER WE THINK.

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:55.865
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MAYBE GETTING

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:57.500
THOSE TYPES OF IMPACTS ARE ARE

00:53:57.567 --> 00:53:58.902
IMPORTANT BUT SHOULDN'T. REALLY

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:00.737
BE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ON SOME

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:01.938
OF THE OTHER PROGRAM DESIGN

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:04.007
FEATURES A CIVICALLY. THINGS

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.609
LIKE- PRICE DECLINES IN THE

00:54:05.675 --> 00:54:07.110
LEVEL THE PRICE CEILING WHICH IS

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:09.145
KIND OF SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:10.013
TRYING TO MAKE IT MITIGATE THAT

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.148
AFFECTS. AND IMPORTANTLY THE USE

00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:14.818
OF ALLOWANCE REVENUE- SO FOR

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:16.686
EXAMPLE LET'S SAY YOUR MIGHT

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:18.254
WANT TO CONSIDER. HOW REVENUE

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:19.990
CAN BE USED TO PARK PARTIALLY OR

00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:21.958
FULLY OFFSET. ANY OF THOSE

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:23.460
CONCERNS ABOUT FINANCIAL IMPACTS

00:54:23.526 --> 00:54:25.462
THROUGH TAX REBATES OR OR TAX

00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:26.630
REDUCTIONS OR SOMETHING LIKE

00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:28.264
THAT- SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:29.132
AN IMPORTANT SET OF

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:30.400
CONSIDERATIONS AROUND KIND OF

00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:32.168
THE- THE CONVERSATION AROUND

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:33.670
AWHILE AND SUPPLY BUT WE DO

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:35.338
THINK DECISIONS ABOUT. ADJUSTING

00:54:35.405 --> 00:54:36.973
THE ALLOWANCE SUPPLY SHOULD.

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.174
SHOULD BE MAINLY FOCUSED ON KIND

00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:39.309
OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS AND

00:54:39.376 --> 00:54:40.944
THEN SOME OF THESE OTHER

00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:42.412
MECHANISMS COULD BE USED TO.

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:51.154
MITIGATE. ANY POTENTIAL

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:54.658
FINANCIAL AND I. GOT IMPACT. SO

00:54:54.724 --> 00:54:55.792
IN MY COMMENTS. HERE BUT IF

00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:57.093

THEY IS FOR ANYBODY ON THE

00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:15.645
COMMITTEE. WHAT IS THE CURRENT

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:17.514
NUMBER OF POLLUTERS THAT BUY

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:20.183
SELL OR TRADE ALLOWANCES TO

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:21.117
REDUCE EMISSIONS WITHIN THE

00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:22.919
STATE. IS THERE IS THERE DATA ON

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:29.125
THAT. YES SENATOR- OFF THE TOP

00:55:29.192 --> 00:55:30.260
MY HEAD YOU KNOW THE EXACT

00:55:30.326 --> 00:55:31.895
NUMBER BUT THERE'S AROUND FOUR

00:55:31.961 --> 00:55:33.263
HUNDRED ENTITIES THAT ARE

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:34.230
REGULATED IN THE STATE OF

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:35.632
CALIFORNIA THE CHAIR THE CARD

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:36.933
CHAIRMAN WISH TO CORRECT ME I

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.001
CAN PULL THAT UP FOR YOU. THERE

00:55:38.068 --> 00:55:40.070
ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

00:55:40.136 --> 00:55:41.971
PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE NOT WHAT WE

00:55:42.038 --> 00:55:43.339
CALL COMPLIANCE ENTITIES PEOPLE

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:44.741
ARE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS

00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:46.576
OF THE PROGRAM BUT WHO

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:47.977
PARTICIPATE AS INVESTORS-

00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:49.412
SPECULATORS AS OTHER KINDS OF

00:55:49.479 --> 00:55:50.747
ACTORS IN THE FINANCIAL SIDE OF

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:52.382
THIS MARKET BUT ON THE ORDER OF

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:55.518
FOUR HUNDRED- COMPANIES AND

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:56.553
ENTITIES IN THE STATE OF

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:58.354
CALIFORNIA. WHAT ABOUT OUT OF

00:55:58.421 --> 00:56:03.660
STATE. CENTER OFF THE TOP OF MY

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:04.894
HEAD I DON'T KNOW- AND I SUSPECT

00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:08.331
THAT. I KNOW KARMA HAS THAT

00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:09.866
INFORMATION I'LL TRY AND LOOK IT

00:56:09.933 --> 00:56:11.601
UP WHILE WE'RE SPEAKING HERE.

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:12.836
OKAY THEN MY NEXT QUESTION IS

00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:14.938
FOR THE I. E. MAC. ONE OF THE

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:17.340
CARBON. WHAT OTHER CARBON COST

00:56:17.407 --> 00:56:18.675
IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW THEY

00:56:18.742 --> 00:56:20.410
INTERACT WITH THE COST OF CARBON

00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:22.779
IN CAP AND TRADE. IS THERE AN

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:30.453
OVERLAP. A FEDERAL JUDGE FIRST

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.054
OTHERS MAY WANT TO ADD ON TO

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:34.023
THIS. IS CLEARLY AN OVERLAP AND

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:36.426
BY DESIGN AND OVERLAP THE- THE-

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:38.428
REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT

00:56:38.495 --> 00:56:39.796
EVERYTHING FROM THE LOW CARBON

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:42.565
FUEL STANDARD TO. ENTER YOUR

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:45.034
CYSTITIS PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:48.505
OF CENTRAL ALL OF WHAT MANY OF

00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:50.874
THEM. AFFECT THE SAME SOURCES

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.175
THAT ARE COVERED BY THE CAP AND

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:54.778
TRADE PROGRAM CAP AND TRADE THE

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:56.312
COUPLE MARKET COVERS

00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:58.581
APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE TOTAL

00:56:58.648 --> 00:56:59.883
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM

00:56:59.949 --> 00:57:01.785
THE STATE ABOUT US. GENERALLY

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:03.219
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IS THE

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:04.621
CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS

00:57:04.687 --> 00:57:05.688
SOCIALLY WITH FOSSIL FUEL

00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:07.991
COMBUSTION. AND THEN MANY OTHER

00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:10.326
SOURCES DISPERSED- GREENHOUSE

00:57:10.393 --> 00:57:12.162
GAS EMISSIONS WOULD INCLUDE.

00:57:12.228 --> 00:57:14.864
METHANE FROM A MUNICIPAL SOLID

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:18.001
WASTE STORED NATURAL GAS USE-

00:57:18.067 --> 00:57:19.803
OTHER EMISSIONS OF SOCIAL

00:57:19.869 --> 00:57:24.340
NETWORKING LANDS. AND SUCH FOR

00:57:24.407 --> 00:57:26.843
THE- SHOULD CELTIC YOU'RE- YES

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:29.145
SOME THANK YOU THE NOW THIS IS

00:57:29.212 --> 00:57:31.748
FOR- DELEO- MISTER ROSS HOW MUCH

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:33.383
CLOSER WOULD WE BE TOWARDS

00:57:33.449 --> 00:57:36.452
REACHING OUR TWENTY THIRTY. GOAL

00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:37.921
OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AT

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:40.690
THE STATE BEGAN COUNTING CARBON

00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:46.763
EMISSIONS FROM WILDFIRES.

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:49.265
SENATOR DOLLY- MEANS TO THE NET

00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:51.835
I JUST MY- INITIAL REACTION IS

00:57:51.901 --> 00:57:52.869
THE NET EMISSIONS FROM FORESTS

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:54.804
ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:56.639
SOURCE OF EMISSIONS TO COUNT- IN

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:57.974
PART BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:00.543
ANNUAL VARIATION AND WILDFIRE

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:01.344
RELATED EMISSIONS OF FOR

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:04.414
EXAMPLE- I THINK IN TWENTY

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.481
TWENTY AND THE ESTIMATE WAS THAT

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:06.683
THERE WERE OVER A HUNDRED

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:09.018
MILLION TONS. OF EMISSIONS FROM

00:58:09.085 --> 00:58:11.421
WILDFIRES BUT THE YEAR BEFORE IT

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:13.556
WAS CLOSER TO FIVE MILLION TIMES

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:14.991
A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON THE

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.960
ANNUAL BERRY ATION. PLUS THE NET

00:58:17.026 --> 00:58:18.962
IMPACT ON CARBON I'M GONNA NEED

00:58:19.028 --> 00:58:20.263
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.598
CARBON THAT'S BEEN SEQUESTERED

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:24.267
IN STORED EACH YEAR SO I THINK.

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:25.768
IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT SOME YEARS

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:28.504
ADDING WILDFIRE EMISSIONS WOULD

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.606
PUT US FURTHER AWAY FROM OUR

00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:31.641
GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS AND IN SOME

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:32.275
CASES KIND OF QUITE A BIT

00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:35.144
FURTHER. BUT IN OTHER YEARS- YOU

00:58:35.211 --> 00:58:37.447
KNOW MAYBE NOT THAT MUCH OF A

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:38.047
DIFFERENCE OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:39.082
MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT

00:58:39.148 --> 00:58:40.250
ABOUT THE ISSUE GIVEN THIS

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.751
ANNUAL VARIATION AND KIND OF

00:58:41.818 --> 00:58:43.219
LONGER TIME HORIZONS KIND OF A

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:50.059
DECADE AT A TIME BECAUSE. THERE

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:51.427
IS A LOT OF THIS ANNUAL

00:58:51.494 --> 00:58:52.095
FLUCTUATION. WELL DOES YOUR YOUR

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:52.996
WAY WE DON'T. WE DON'T COUNT

00:58:53.062 --> 00:58:55.298
THOSE CARD WE DO COUNT FOREST

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:56.065
FIRE. SO IT IS A TO MAKE THAT

00:58:56.132 --> 00:58:57.734
STATEMENT I TO BUILD TRY TO GET

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.335
A GET US THE LARGEST TO COUNTER

00:58:59.402 --> 00:59:01.137
WE DON'T CARE SO THAT THE NEXT

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:01.771
QUESTION WOULD BE. THIS COULD BE

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:03.172
FOUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE R. A. R.

00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:04.140
B. WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE IF

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:05.341
THE STATE BEGAN ACCOUNT FORCED

00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:07.110
EMISSIONS TOWARDS OUR STATEWIDE

00:59:07.176 --> 00:59:12.048
GOAL. I THINK THAT AS AS ROSS

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:15.451
NOTED IT IS CHALLENGING TO-

00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:18.087
CALCULATE- THAT GHG EMISSIONS

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:21.624
FROM. WILDFIRE GIVEN THAT- SOME

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:23.226
OF ITS NATURAL SOME OF ITS-

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:26.763
ANTHROPOGENIC- AND SO I DON'T

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:29.265
KNOW THAT WE HAVE. AN ESTIMATE

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:31.534
OF WHAT THAT WOULD. WHAT THAT

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:34.137
WOULD LOOK LIKE WE DO- TRACK

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:36.506
WILDFIRE EMISSIONS- WE ASSESS

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:38.441
THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:42.478
EMISSIONS. AND THE STATE HAS. OF

00:59:42.545 --> 00:59:44.814
COURSE. BEEN PUTTING SIGNIFICANT

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.349
RESOURCES AND EFFORT INTO

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:50.987
REDUCING WILDFIRES- SO AS- IN

00:59:51.054 --> 00:59:51.854
THE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.856
CHAPTER OF THE SCOPING PLAN

00:59:53.923 --> 00:59:55.625
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO AS

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:57.794
MUCH. ANALYSIS OF THAT AS

00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.897
POSSIBLE. OKAY THANK YOU SO MY

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:02.966
NEXT QUESTION IS GOING TO BE FOR

REPORT OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS IN

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:17.880
REVIEWING THE ARTICLE ON THE

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:20.950
REPORT. IN THE INSIDE EPA WHICH

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:23.653
WAS TITLED PEACE. THE PANEL

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.023
WANTS HIGHER GHG CREDIT CRISIS.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.625
WOULD YOU LIKE THE FLOOR OF THE

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:30.827
PRICE WOULD YOU WOULD YOU LIKE

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:33.262
TO. THE FLOOR PRICE OF CARBON

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.164
INCREASED IN THE CAP AND TRADE

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.734
PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.268
QUESTION SENATOR ADJUSTER

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:41.871
BRIEFLY CLARIFY THE I MAC REPORT

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.039
DOES NOT CALL FOR THE

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:44.207
APPROPRIATE PRICE DOUBLED THAT

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:45.641
SHOULD BE SET- BUT I DO WANT TO

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:46.943
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.579
BECAUSE I THINK YOU RAISE A VERY

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:50.646
IMPORTANT QUESTION- MY PERSONAL

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:53.149
OPINION IS THAT. THE PRICE FOR

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.550
WE CURRENTLY HAVE IS NOT

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:56.119
CONSISTENT WITH THE CAPITATE

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:57.553
PROGRAM PLAYING A SIGNIFICANT

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.522
ROLE IN DRIVING OUR EMISSIONS

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:00.556
REDUCTIONS TO THE TWENTY THIRTY

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:03.092
TARGET SO IF POLICYMAKERS WISH

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:04.394
TO HAVE A LARGE ROLE FOR THIS

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.362
PROGRAM AND WISH TO HIT THE

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:07.363
LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED TARGET.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.931
AND I THINK PRICES DO NEED TO BE

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.166
HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT PRICE

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:12.135
FOR- BUT AGAIN JUST TO CLARIFY

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:12.969
THE REPORT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:15.471
CALL FOR- A PARTICULAR PRICE

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:17.206
LEVEL THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A POLICY

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:19.108
QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.176
AND TO SOME EXTENT THE

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:22.345
LEGISLATURE AS WELL- I'M NOT

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:23.813
FAMILIAR WITH THE WITH THE

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.049
COVERAGE YOU SITE BUT I WANTED

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:26.916
TO CLARIFY THAT. VERY BRIEFLY IF

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:28.851
I MAY SENATOR- WITH RESPECT TO

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:30.153
WILDFIRE MISSIONS QUESTION THIS

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:31.554
IS AN ISSUE OF COLLEAGUES AND

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:32.889
ARE WRKING ON RIGHT NOW I'LL BE

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:33.923
HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.258
THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHEN

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.859
YOU DON'T HAVE MEGA FIRES LIKE

01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:39.162
WE SAW IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:40.797
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SEASONS. FIRES

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:42.899
ARE NOT THAT ARE NOT BAD THE

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:44.600
FORESTS ARE PROBABLY CLOSE TO A

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:47.203
SINK OR TO HELPING US AND WHEN

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.438
WE HAVE THE PRESENCE OF THESE

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:49.539
BAD YEARS FORCE MAKE THE

01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:51.541
CHALLENGE HARDER TO ANSWER YOUR

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:52.608
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:54.577
INCLUDING FORESTS MAKES IT

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:56.045
EASIER OR HARDER I THINK WE ARE

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:57.580
LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE

01:01:57.647 --> 01:01:59.215
FORESTS ARE ACTUALLY HURTING THE

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.750
STATE'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE AND

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.318
THAT COMICAL BECAUSE OF THE FIRE

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:04.120
RISK THAT WESTERN FORCES FACE IN

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:08.958
PARTICULAR- GET HAPPY TO FOLLOW

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:11.394
UP ON ANY OF THAT. I WILL. I

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:12.395
WANTED. TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THAT

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:13.763
WHEN I WHEN TO FOLLOW UP ON MY-

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:14.730
ORIGINAL. WHAT OF. SO WHAT DO

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.432
YOU THINK THE PRICE OF CARBON

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:17.066
SHOULD BE SHOULD BE FIFTY SIXTY

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:18.634
DOLLARS. HUNDRED WHAT WHAT WOULD

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:20.336
THAT LOOK LIKE I KNOW THAT-

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.105
DIVIDED ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:24.140
IT SHOULD BE AROUND FIFTY ONE.

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:26.976
DOLLARS YES YOU'RE REFERRING TO

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:28.144
THE WHAT'S CALLED THE SOCIAL

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:30.113
COST OF CARBON WHICH IS A FAIRLY

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.414
STANDARD WAY THAT ACADEMICS HAVE

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.316
THOUGHT ABOUT. THE LONG TERM

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:35.051
SOCIAL DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:36.652
POLLUTING THE ATMOSPHERE WITH

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:37.887
CARBON AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.222
POLLUTION SO I THINK THAT'S

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:40.490
RELEVANT MY COLLEAGUE DALLAS

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:41.891
KNOWS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THAT

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:44.727
WORK- I'M- AGAIN. I'M NOT IN ANY

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:45.862
WAY TRYING TO DODGE YOUR

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:47.597
QUESTION THIS IS A POLICY

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:48.397
QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:50.933
ADDRESSED. OUR JOB AND THE IF

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.502
THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AT LEAST

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:55.171
AS I SEE IT. IS TO ADVISE ON THE

01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:56.005
CHOICES THE POLICIES ARE MAKERS

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:57.140
ARE MAKING AND WHETHER OR NOT

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:58.608
THEY'RE CONSISTENT SO THE BEST

01:02:58.674 --> 01:03:00.042
ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU IT IS.

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.744
VERY DIFFICULT TO SPECIFY A

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:03.679
PRECISE NUMBER. BUT THE NUMBER

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:05.014
NEEDS TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:07.483
POLICY STRATEGY. AND SO A KEY

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.018
PREDICATE TO YOUR QUESTION IS

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:10.786
HOW MUCH OF A ROLE THIS PROGRAM

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.321
SHOULD BE PLAYING. IN ORDER TO

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:14.023
GET TO OUR TARGET. THERE ARE

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:15.324
OTHER POLICIES AND MEASURES WE

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:17.160
USE SOME OF WHICH ARE RELATIVELY

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:18.694
COST EFFECTIVE SOME OF WHICH ARE

01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:20.596
RELATIVELY NOT COST EFFECTIVE.

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:21.964
AND THE COMBINATION OF POLICIES

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:23.399
IS GOING TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.834
OF WHAT THE OVERALL COST PROFILE

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.969
WOULD BE TO GET THERE- I THINK

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.104
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.172
ISSUE THE MODEL THAT I

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:30.940
SYMPATHIZE WITH THE CHALLENGE

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:31.908
FACING THEIR RESOURCES BOARD

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.276
AND- DRESSING THE TYPE OF

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:34.477
QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING WHICH I

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:35.878
THINK NEEDS TO BE MADE EXPLICIT.

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.180
AND ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES WE

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:38.714
HAVE RIGHT NOW. IS THERE AREN'T

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.183
CLEAR EXPECTATIONS ARE WHAT THAT

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:41.684
NUMBER SHOULD BE. I THINK THAT

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:43.286
UNCERTAINTY CREATES CHALLENGES

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:45.188
IN THE LONG RUN THAT ARE THAT

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:45.855
ARE MORE PROBLEMATIC THAN TRYING

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.356
TO SET A CORRECT NUMBER. AND A

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:49.358
FISCAL POLICY THAT ADDRESSES THE

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:50.893
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT NUMBER.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.696
WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT- I

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:54.931
THINK THIS IS THE KEY QUESTION

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:55.965
THAT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:57.600
BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:01.604
CONTINUALLY. PASSES LEGISLATION

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:02.238
TO SET TARGETS. WE HAVE A TWENTY

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:04.540
THIRD GOAL. WITH THAT NEEDS TO

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:07.510
BE SET AND ACHIEVE THOSE THERE'S

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:10.580
AN IMPACT TO THE CONSUMER I MEAN

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:12.615
. WHEN THE CONSUMER AT THE END

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:15.218
OF THE DAY IN IN IN- TWO

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:15.818
THOUSAND SIXTEEN STANDARDIZED

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:17.186
REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT ON

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:19.822
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BY CAR

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:20.856
THEY STATED THE FOLLOWING

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.692
CONTENT THIS IS THIS IS FOR

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:26.329
EVERY FOR EVERY. TEN DOLLARS IN

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:29.565
THE ALLOWANCE COST. THE GALLON

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:31.834
OF GAS GOES UP NINE CENTS A

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:32.935
GALLON OF DIESEL GOES UP TEN

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:34.704
CENTS. BUT FOR EVERY TEN

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:37.373
DOLLARS. NATURAL GAS GOES UP

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.442
POINT FIVE. PER THERM

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:40.876
ELECTRICITY RATES GO UP SIX

01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:41.911
DOLLARS AND THIRTY FIVE CENTS

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:43.579
PER MEGAWATT SO THAT'S SIX CENTS

01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:46.215
A KILOWATT. SIX POINT THREE FIVE

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:49.619
CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR- SO THIS

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:50.486
IS THIS IS THE QUESTION NEED TO

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:54.123
BE ASKED BECAUSE- IF WE DO GO TO

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:55.358
. SOME NUMBER WHATEVER THAT

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:56.759
NUMBER IS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL

01:04:56.826 --> 01:04:58.294
IT'S GOING TO DIRECTLY IMPACT

01:04:58.361 --> 01:04:59.595
THE COST OF LIVING TO EVERY

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:02.365
SINGLE CALIFORNIAN. IN IN AND

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.500
THAT'S IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED- I

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.269
WILL BE I'M BERNARD SHAW HAS HIS

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:08.037
HAND UP SO MAYBE HE'S THE CHAIR

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:10.773
OF THE- I MAC. DOCTOR WANTED TO

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.043
GIVE IT A CRACK. THANK YOU. I

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:15.745
AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT DANNY

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:18.281
COHEN WORDS. A WORD FOR WORD. I

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:20.449
THINK. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:22.952
THE- IN THE NEXT WEEK MONTHS IF

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:24.887
NOT WEEKS I WOULD EXPECT THE BY

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.289
DEMONSTRATION TO REVISE THE

01:05:26.355 --> 01:05:28.391
SOCIAL COST OF CARBON AND IT

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:30.760
WILL. IT'S CONFIDENTIAL NOW AND

01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:32.061
I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION.

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:33.729
BUT BASED ON THE LITTER ON AN

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:35.831
EXTENSIVE ADDITIONAL LITERATURE

01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:37.500
SINCE LAST TIME WAS UPDATED. I

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:38.134
THINK THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.102
ESTIMATES WILL DOUBLE OR MORE

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:41.203
WILL BE A THREE DAY JUST IN

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.272
TERMS OF THE- NATIONAL ELSE

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:44.440
LITTLE WHAT THE IMPACT ON

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:46.108
SOCIETY AS PER TON OF CARBON.

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:51.247
ADMITTED HOWEVER. IS DANNY

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:52.682
STARTED TO ANSWER. DOES THAT-

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:55.318
YEAH SHOULD YOU WANTED FROM AN

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:56.085
ECONOMIC FOR THAT'S WITH PRICE

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:57.953
OF COVERAGE BE BUT IT'S NOT WHAT

01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.689
THE PRICE OF CARBON CAN BE IT'S

01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:01.424
NOT SUSTAINABLE POLITICALLY OR

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:04.193
ECONOMICALLY I WOULD ARGUE ABOUT

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.529
MY PAY GRADE SENATOR BUT THAT

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:08.331
STATE CANNOT SUPPORT SUSTAINED A

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:09.899
TYPE OF A PRICE LEVEL WITH THE

01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:12.601
ACTING INDIVIDUALLY AS A STATE

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:13.536
SO THEREFORE THAT'S WHY THE

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:14.603
WHOLE DESIGN OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:17.073
CLIMATE POLICY PORTFOLIO.

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.909
INVOLVES USING A CARBON PRICE TO

01:06:19.975 --> 01:06:21.010
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO LOW

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:23.045
COST MR REDUCTIONS LOOK BEHIND

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:25.381
BUT ALSO IT FEARS OF REGULATORY

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:26.849
MEASURES TO TRY TO DRIVE

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:28.284
INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT AND

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:30.553
TRY TO ACHIEVE CARBON REDUCTIONS

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:31.887
A WAY THAT WILL JUST TRIGGER

01:06:31.954 --> 01:06:34.557
LEAKAGE ACROSS THE FACILITY THE

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:35.925
- THAT'S SUCH A WRECK WITH

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:37.326
RESPECT YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:38.828
ABOUT WHAT WHAT I ADVOCATE FOR

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:40.262
PRICE FOR TO BE INCREASED OR NOT

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:42.198
AS THE AGENDAS OF THE NETWORK

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:44.166
SAID THAT IS NOT OUR JOB BUT I

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:45.368
WILL POINT OUT THE RIGHT NOW

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:47.636
SINCE THE PRICE IS WELL TEN OR

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:48.704
TWELVE DOLLARS ABOVE THE PRICE

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:50.806
FLOOR. I DON'T SEE WHERE HOW

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:53.509
WOULD HELP THE STATE GOALS IN

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:56.045
ANY WAY EXCEPT FOR THE CUTE

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:57.346
AFFORDABILITY QUESTION YOU JUST

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:59.281
RAISE KEEPING OUT OF MIND I

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:00.483
DOESN'T OPEN CIRCLES ANYWAY TO

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:01.550
SEE THE PRICE COME BACK DOWN AND

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:03.552
DROP TEN DOLLARS BACK TO THE

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:05.521
PRESS FOR SO THERE IS AN

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:06.722
OPPORTUNITY IN THIS PART THE

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:07.957
SCOPING PLAN PROCESS I THINK

01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:10.292
THAT THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:12.328
ALL SLICKLY AND FINALLY. WE ARE

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:13.796
THE COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED A

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.464
VARIETY OF POLICIES THAT ARE

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:16.832
THERE COULD BE POSSIBLE AND ONE

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:18.968
OF THOSE WOULD NOT JUST BE TO

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:20.136
RAISE THE PRICE FOR BETTER

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.337
INCREASE SO IT'S A PRICE

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.105
RESPONSE TO SUPPLY FOOD WHEN

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:24.573
IT'S CHEAPER TO ACHIEVE A MISS

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.908
REDUCTIONS MORE EMISSION

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:27.543
REDUCTIONS OR KERR OR BECOMES

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.545
MORE EXPENSIVE TO DO SO BUT MORE

01:07:29.612 --> 01:07:30.613
MISSIONAL ELSE'S MODEM TO THE

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:32.548
MARKET SO THAT'S WHY I WENT TO

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:33.382
PREVIOUSLY HAD SOME WAX

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:35.217
DESCRIBING ADDITIONAL PRICE

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:36.552
STEPPER PRICE STEPS THAT COULD

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:38.120
BE ADDED TO THE MARKET. I THINK

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:39.288
THAT MIGHT BE A REFORM THAT

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:40.723
WOULD BE BETTER THAN JUST

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:41.891
INCREASING THE PRICE FOR

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:54.537
SECRETARY RUMSFELD- BUT

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:55.204
WITHSTANDING THE- HEDGE FUND MAN

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:56.539
. ARE THE UNITED STATES HAVE

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.874
THERE IN HERE- CAN YOU. AS

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:00.276
SIMPLY TO SAY THAT I THINK

01:08:00.342 --> 01:08:02.711
RANDALL. SAID ISRAEL WELL I'M

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:03.746
VISAS ARE NOT NEW EXCLUSIVE WE

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:04.747
CAN REDUCE. GREENHOUSE GAS AND

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:06.182
I'LL POLLUTANTS AND- MANAGER FOR

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.516
AND THAT AND I THINK SHE WAS

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.452
TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.320
THAT EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:12.922
DOES THAT- WE'RE INCREDIBLY

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:14.557
FOCUSED INTO THE TALLY ON THIS

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:17.259
ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY- AND THAT

01:08:17.326 --> 01:08:19.061
HAS TO BE INTEGRATED INTO EVERY

01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:22.431
ELEMENT OF. HOW WE PLAN HOW WE

01:08:22.498 --> 01:08:25.668
EXAMINE WHAT WE'RE DOING HOW

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.136
WE'RE DOING AND THAT AND I

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.204
THINK. PART OF THE DISCUSSION

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:28.771
THAT YOU'LLFOCUSING ON AND

01:08:28.838 --> 01:08:30.506
HELPING US FOCUS ON IS IF YOU

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.341
JUST LOOK A CAP AND TRADE IN

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:33.075
ISOLATION OF ALL THE OTHER

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.610
PROGRAMS AND REGULATIONS AND

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:37.046
INCENTIVES AND INNOVATION-

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:38.247
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE FULL

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:39.849
PICTURE OF HOW WE'RE GONNA.

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:43.752
TACKLE OUR PRODUCTION GOALS- BUT

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:45.221
MAKE NO MISTAKE WE ARE WE ARE

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.356
INCREDIBLY FOCUSED ON THINGS FOR

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:48.858
INSTANCE WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:49.825
THAT CALIFORNIA ENERGY

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:51.861
COMMISSION. IS DOING ON ENERGY

01:08:51.927 --> 01:08:54.163
EFFICIENCY THAT HELPS PEOPLE

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:57.600
SAVE ON THEIR ENERGY BILLS- WEEK

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.969
IN WEEK OUT THE SAME IS NOW TRUE

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:01.670
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL COST

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:03.472
OF. MAINTAINING AND OWNING AN

01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:05.708
ELECTRIC VEHICLE THIS IS THE

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:07.143
FUEL AT THE PUMP AND WE'RE

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:08.477
PUTTING IN TIME TOGETHER WITH

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.179
THE LEGISLATURE'S SIGNIFICANT

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.580
FUNDING INTO LOW INCOME PROGRAMS

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:13.148
TO. HELP BRIDGE THOSE

01:09:13.215 --> 01:09:14.750
AFFORDABILITY GAP SO

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:17.152
AFFORDABILITY IS A VERY SHE'S

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:19.555
CONCERNED. THAT WE SHARE AND

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.924
JUST TO GO BACK TO- CHECK THAT

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:25.027
TROLLS COMMENT- THE SOCIAL COST

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:27.096
OF CARBON IS AND WHAT THE

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.797
IMPACTS OF CARBON HOW THEY

01:09:28.864 --> 01:09:30.599
NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ECONOMY

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.801
OUR HEALTH- IT ISN'T DIRECTLY

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.703
ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WALK KABIN

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.106
SHOULD COST WITHIN THE CAP AND

01:09:37.172 --> 01:09:38.073
TRADE- ANY. MARKET BASED

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.743
MECHANISM THAT THAT SEPARATE-

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:41.877
ISSUES IN TO CONFLATE THEM I

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:43.979
THINK- LEADS AN IMPRESSION THE

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:45.481
OLDEST COST NEEDS TO BE BORN

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:46.615
THROUGH THE CAP AND TRADE

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:47.950
PROGRAM. WE NEED TO JUST

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.785
RECOGNIZE THAT COBB AND IS

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.921
HAVING INCREDIBLY DAMAGING

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:53.789
EFFECTS ON OUR HEALTH TODAY AS

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.025
YOU ARTICULATED ON. WILDFIRE

01:09:56.091 --> 01:09:58.694
SMOKE ALONE- BUT LOOK AT THE

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:01.230
DROUGHT FOR US- AND THE EXTREME

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:02.631
HEAT IMPACTS THAT THERE'S A

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.133
WHOLE LOT OF CALCULATED INTO THE

01:10:04.199 --> 01:10:06.735
SOCIAL COST. OF CARBON- AND SO

01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:08.704
WE ARE PAYING FOR THEM. AND I

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:10.239
AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:12.341
DO COLLECTIVELY IS COME OUT WITH

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:14.944
A SET OF MEASURES THAT REDUCE

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.346
CARBON. AT THE SAME TIME DON'T

01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:23.485
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT. STUFF

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.721
CALIFORNIANS. SENATOR ALL MY

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:28.057
PURSE ALL THOSE IN BUT I THINK

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:28.891
THE KEY THING I HEARD A THERE

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:31.126
WAS A HOLISTIC. SO I'VE BEEN

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:33.329
HERE TEN YEARS AND UNLIMITED

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:35.264
HERE. AND I'VE BEEN TALKING

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:39.602
ABOUT. BILL FOREST FIRE IN. WE

01:10:39.668 --> 01:10:42.171
SEEM TO USE IT AS WE BURNED

01:10:42.237 --> 01:10:43.172
ALMOST FOUR POINT THREE MILLION

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:47.109
ACRES. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:48.811
TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE I

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:50.579
BELIEVE IT IS. SO WHEN YOU TALK

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:51.814
ABOUT. THAT THAT'S OUR SEEK THAT

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.215
YOU KNOW WHAT WE LEARNED IN

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:54.950
FIFTH GRADE IS WHAT WE READ OUT

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:56.719
THE TREES BREEDING BUT THEY'RE

01:10:56.785 --> 01:10:57.519
DEAD. THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.822
SEQUESTERING CARBON. EMITTING

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:03.058
CARBON. ENTERS THE POLICIES OF

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:04.593
HOW WE MANAGE OUR FOREST WE'VE

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.129
GOT A HUNDRED YEARS OF FIRE

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:08.130
SUPPRESSION WHICH IS NOT NATURAL

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:10.165
TO ARE FORCED. IN THE FORCE

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:12.267
NATURALLY THIN ITSELF WITH FIRE.

01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:13.502
WE NEED TO THIN OR FORCE ALLOWED

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:15.170
TO BE ALIVE WHEN FIRE CAN WIN

01:11:15.237 --> 01:11:16.138
THEN WE CAN HAVE FAR TO GO

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.440
THROUGH THERE SO WE POINT TO THE

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:21.276
FIRE. AND THE SMOKE AND THE- IN

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:23.912
THE- HEALTH. THE ISSUES THAT

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:25.014
COME WITH THAT AND THEN WE GO

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.018
AND REGULATE. THE CARS IN

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:31.487
BREEDERS AND LAWN MOWERS AND

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:33.422
SMALL GENERATORS THINGS THAT

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:34.957
PEOPLE NEED EVERY DAY TO.

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:36.458
SUSTAIN LIFE WHEN THERE'S NO

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:37.793
POWER IN THE STATE SO

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.428
HOLISTICALLY I WANT I WANT TO

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:40.729
TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND WE

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:42.364
DON'T SEEM TO EVER TALK ABOUT.

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:44.400
WHAT THE LONG TERM GOAL IS GOING

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:46.535
TO BE AT THE SAME TIME. MY

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:48.771
CONSTITUENTS AND EVERYONE OF THE

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.973
SENATOR'S CONSTITUENTS COST OF.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:51.874
THINGS THAT THEY USE EVERY DAY

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.309
IS SKYROCKETING IN CALIFORNIA I

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.145
HAVE A TRUCKING BUSINESS. THE

01:11:56.211 --> 01:11:58.113
ONE UP A DOLLAR FOR DIESEL IN

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:02.117
THE LAST THREE MONTHS THAT'S A

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:03.252
HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY IT COST ME

01:12:03.318 --> 01:12:05.354
FOR EACH TRUCK. THAT'S DRIVES UP

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:07.956
THE COST OF A LOAF OF BREAD-

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:09.391
WHEN YOU BUILD A HOUSE ALL THAT

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.293
GETS PASSED ON TO THE END USER

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.128
AND THE POOREST. PEOPLE IN

01:12:13.195 --> 01:12:14.930
CALIFORNIA THE WORKING CLASS

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:17.332
PEOPLE ARE GETTING DEVASTATE WE

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:19.668
TALK ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE. THOSE

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:21.737
PEOPLE. THERE ARE ENOUGH FOR THE

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:23.439
PEOPLE ON A FIXED INCOME ARE

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:24.707
GETTING ESTROYED IN CALIFORNIA

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.942
AND IT'S BECAUSE THESE POLICIES

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.510
DON'T LINE UP WITH LIKE REALLY

01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:29.778
REDUCING CARBON AND THAT'S

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:32.715
THAT'S BEEN MY- MY- FRUSTRATION

01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:35.017
OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE WE DON'T.

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:36.719
THEY DON'T THERE'S NO HOLISTIC

01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:39.421
PROGRAM HERE SO I WANT TO JUST

01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:40.956
ADD. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:43.058
AB THREE NINETY EIGHT TWO

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.259
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:45.627
CENTERPIECE OF THAT. WAS TO KANE

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:46.528
CONTAIN COST AND PROTECT

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:48.163
CONSUMERS. THOSE ARE OUR

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:49.798
CONSTITUENTS RIGHT NOW THERE IN

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:52.701
MY MIND AREN'T BEING PROTECTED

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:53.969
WHILE REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS.

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:55.370
WHY ARE WE WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT

01:12:55.437 --> 01:12:57.005
CHANGING THIS PROGRAM WE'RE ONLY

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:59.608
TWO YEARS INTO IT. THAT THAT'S A

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:00.275
QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO ASK AND

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:02.411
I HAVE SINCE. MY LAST THREE OR

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:04.880
FOUR QUESTIONS. I HAVE HERE IS-

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:08.417
FOR CHAIR RAND OFF. SO FOR THE

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:10.686
CHAIR WELL WHAT PERCENTAGE. IS

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:11.754
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.189
PLAYING IN REDUCING GHG UNDER

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:20.529
THE CURRENT SCOPING PLAN. HE

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:22.197
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING CLAN-

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:23.899
ASSUMED ABOUT A THIRTY EIGHT

01:13:23.966 --> 01:13:26.802
PERCENT- ROLE FOR CAP AND TRADE

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:29.404
AND THE NEWS COMING PLAN WILL.

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:31.607
ANALYZE WHAT WORLD CAP AND TRADE

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:34.443
SHOULD PLAY- WE WILL LOOK AT ALL

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:35.778
OF OUR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS FOR

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:39.414
REDUCING CARBON- LOOKING AT-

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:41.617
WHAT REDUCTIONS WE EXPECT. TO

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:42.818
GET FROM THOSE DIFFERENT

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:44.019
PROGRAMS SOME OF WHICH DID NOT

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:47.089
EXIST- DURING THIS TWENTY

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:47.723
SEVENTEEN SCRAPPING PLANNED SO

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.057
IT'LL BE A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO

01:13:49.124 --> 01:13:51.727
ASSESS THOSE- AND THEN WE WILL

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:53.462
SEE WHAT KEPT THAT CAP AND TRADE

01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:58.066
PROGRAM SHOULD- EXPECT TO COVER-

01:13:58.133 --> 01:13:59.635
BEYOND THOSE PROGRAMS AND SAID

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:02.738
THAT'S THE ANALYSIS THAT WE ARE

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:03.772
WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. MY SECOND

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:04.673
WOULD BE WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.074
THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IS

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:08.043
PLAYING IN REDUCING GHGS IN THE

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:11.013
CURRENT SCOPING PLAN. SO AGAIN

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:12.014
THAT WILL BE PART OF THE

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.816
ANALYSIS THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:15.417
PROGRAM THAT WAS NOT IN- FULL

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:18.053
EFFECT- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.822
SO THERE WILL BE A NEW

01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:22.658
OPPORTUNITY TO. DETERMINE WHAT

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:26.628
ROLE L. CSS WILL BE PLAYING. SO

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:28.197
WHICH PROGRAM IT IN ARE YOU

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:30.132
EVALUATING THE SCOPING PLAN GETS

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:32.801
THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF GHG

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:33.802
REDUCTIONS FOR THE LEAST COST

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:36.004
PER TON. THAT'S PART OF THE

01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:37.206
ANALYSIS WERE DOING RIGHT NOW

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:38.874
THAT WE- WILL BE REALLY

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.909
RELEASING LATER THIS SPRING AND

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:44.947
THAT WILL THAT WILL BE. OUT WHEN

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:46.348
. WE HAVE SOME INITIAL MODELING

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:48.383
RESULTS THAT'LL BE OUT IN MID

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:49.985
MARCH AND THEN WE WILL HAVE A

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:53.355
DRAFT. OF THE PROPOSED CAPPING

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:57.292
PLAN AND IN LATE APRIL. MY LAST

01:14:57.359 --> 01:14:58.694
QUESTION WOULD BE THE CURRENT

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.463
SCOPING PLAN IS PREPARING FOR

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:02.898
TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOAL. OF THE

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:05.000
BEAT THAT CARBON NEUTRAL AND THE

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:06.802
STATES AUTHORIZED CAP AND TRADE

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:09.104
PROGRAM WHICH- BUT BY THE WAY

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.439
WAS APPROVED BY A TWO THIRDS

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:12.908
VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE. IS SET

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:14.810
TO EXPIRE IN TWENTY THIRTY. HOW

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:16.278
DO HOW DO YOU PLAN ON MAKING UP

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.046
THE FIFTEEN YEAR GAP OF GHG

01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:19.815
REDUCTIONS WITHOUT AN AUTHORIZED

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:23.118
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM- SO THIS

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.087
COMING PLAN WILL ASSESS OUR

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:28.223
PROGRESS TOWARDS THE- TWENTY

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:30.525
THIRTY GOALS- 40% BELOW NINETEEN

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:31.827
NINETY LEVELS. AND WE'LL ALSO

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:35.731
LOOK AT CARBON NEUTRALITY WE BUY

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:37.199
TWENTY FORTY FIVE OR SOONER- WE

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:40.636
WILL ASSESS- A ROLE FOR CAP AND

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:44.373
TRADE- BUT TO YOUR POINT IT IS

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:50.245
TRUE THAT- BY A LOT IT- IT. ENDS

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:52.381
IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. THANK YOU

01:15:52.447 --> 01:15:54.516
FOR YOUR LAN NEED ASK QUESTIONS

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:56.451
TODAY I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME

01:15:56.518 --> 01:15:58.620
LAST COMMENTS HERE. MY LEVEL OF

01:15:58.687 --> 01:16:00.822
FRUSTRATION HAS BEEN. I'VE I

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:02.624
THINK I'VE VOICED IT PRETTY LOUD

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:04.993
PRETTY PLAINLY OVER THE TIME

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:06.561
THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE

01:16:06.628 --> 01:16:10.599
LEGISLATURE CALIFORNIA. PRODUCES

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:14.636
1% OF THE WORLD'S CARBON. WE ARE

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:16.939
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. THERE

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:18.607
WERE TOUTED AS LEADING THE WORLD

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.442
AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO. REDUCE

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:24.813
CARBON. NUMBER ONE WE DON'T

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:25.814
COUNT THE EMISSIONS FROM FOREST

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:30.686
FIRE. WHICH WE PUT OUR FORCES IN

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.354
THE SHAPE THAT IT'S IN THERE IS

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:33.922
CLIMATE CHANGE BUT A LOT OF IT

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:35.290
IS DUE TO THE MANAGEMENT

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:36.358
POLICIES THAT WE HAVE OVER THE

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:39.594
LAST SIXTY TO SEVENTY YEARS. AND

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:42.364
WE NEED TO AGGRESSIVELY. THEN

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:43.899
THE FOREST AND TAKE CARE OF OUR

01:16:43.966 --> 01:16:45.067
WATERSHEDS OF FIRE CAN ACTUALLY

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:47.135
GO THROUGH THE FORCE WITHOUT

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:47.769
COMPLETELY DESTROYING THE FORCE

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:50.038
WE HAVE. ROUND CATASTROPHIC

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:52.040
FIRES THAT WE CAN REDUCE THOSE

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:53.108
MISSIONS AND- MANY OF THE

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:55.344
LEGISLATORS HAVE BEEN OUT. TO MY

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:57.446
DISTRICT TO SEE WHERE WE STAND

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:58.747
AND FIRE CAME THROUGH WE STILL

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:01.283
HAVE A FORCE THAT'S ALIVE AFTERTHE FIRE COMES THROUGH IT IS

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:03.251
STILL. THE QUESTION CARBON AND

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:05.020
ACTUALLY WHEN WITHIN THE FOREST

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:06.855
IT GROWS TREES FASTER WHICH

01:17:06.922 --> 01:17:07.823
SEQUESTERS MORE CARBON SO

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:11.393
THERE'S A REAL. PUBLIC BENEFIT

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.761
TO DOING GOOD FORESTRY. TWO

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:14.830
THIRDS OF STATE IS FORESTED IN

01:17:14.896 --> 01:17:17.532
THE STAIRS AND WE NEED TO MAKE

01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:19.501
SURE. THAT WE DO THAT. SO I JUST

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:21.636
WANT TO SHARE THAT. IF YOU

01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:24.940
HAVEN'T NOTICED IT'S REALLY

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:27.042
EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:28.810
. FUEL SKYROCKETING COST OF

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:30.479
BUILDING IS SKYROCKETING FOOD IS

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:32.180
SKYROCKETING AND IT'S DUE TO

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:33.715
THESE POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:34.683
THIS LEGISLATURE COULD WE SET

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:37.019
TARGETS WITHOUT A BRIDGE TO GET

01:17:37.085 --> 01:17:40.055
THERE. LAST WEEK IN SUB TWO WE

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:43.125
TALKED ABOUT EV'S. N. EXECUTIVE

01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:45.727
ORDERS THAT ARE GOING TO GET.

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:47.696
THEY GET THEY GET EXACTLY ORDERS

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:49.731
THAT ARE GOING TO GIVE US. ALL

01:17:49.798 --> 01:17:51.333
ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND WE DON'T

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.834
HAVE ANY INFRASTRUCTURE EVEN

01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:55.137
CHARGES ELECTRIC VEHICLES SO I'M

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:57.339
LOOKING FOR OVERALL POLICY OF

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:58.707
HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO OUR

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:01.777
GOALS APPRECIATE YOUR- TIME IN

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:05.013

MEMBERS FOR JOINING US AS WELL

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:23.965
HI I TAKE A SIMILAR I GUESS BUT

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:26.835
SLIGHTLY. SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:29.304
APPROACH- TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:32.808
THE NORTH- I THINK I SHARE THE

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:35.477
ADMINISTRATION'S CONCERNS ABOUT

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:35.944
I GUESS WE'RE CALLING

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:38.914
AFFORDABILITY. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.249
I THINK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY I

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:44.686
THINK ABOUT THE INABILITY FOR

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:45.787
PEOPLE WHO ARE THE MOST

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:47.122
VULNERABLE IN THIS STATE TO

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:51.326
AFFORD. A FUTURE OF RELENTLESS

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:53.495
AN UNMITIGATED CLIMATE CHANGE A

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.864
FUTURE WHERE YOU HAVE TO DEPEND

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:58.767
ON WHAT HAPPENS IN RUSSIA OR

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:02.304
SAUDI ARABIA TO DECIDE- HOW MUCH

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:04.873
YOU'RE GOING TO BE PAYING WHEN

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.575
YOU FILL UP YOUR DIESEL TRUCK

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:07.609
EVERY DAY. OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:11.279
LIVE IN YOUR REFINERY- OR NEAR A

01:19:11.346 --> 01:19:16.084
CEMENT FACTORY OR A GAS FIELD-

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:17.786
OR PEOPLE SIMPLY JUST LIVE NEAR

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:20.188
FREEWAYS AND- THE INFANT

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:22.324
MORTALITY RATES IN. THE

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:23.992
PREMATURE BIRTHS AND PREMATURE

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:27.629
DEATHS THAT. WE GO THROUGH- AS A

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:30.999
STATE AND THE ABJECT PUBLIC

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:34.336
HEALTH CRISIS- THAT'S BEEN

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:36.238
FALLING AS WELL YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:39.374
BEEN STRUGGLING THROUGH COVETED-

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:42.711
THIS HUGE. UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL

01:19:42.777 --> 01:19:46.348
INJUSTICES IS MOUNTING DAILY SO

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:48.884
I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT WE CAN'T

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.619
AFFORD TO JUST THINK ABOUT

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:53.388
TWENTY FORTY FIVE HERE. AND I

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:56.124
APPRECIATE THAT- YOU KNOW THERE

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:57.459
WERE CERTAIN SORT OF MINIMUM

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:59.094
THRESHOLD SET IN LAW BY THE

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:00.729
LEGISLATURE IN BOTH SP THIRTY

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:04.933
TWO AND- IN THE FINER POINT WAS

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.836
PUT ON ALL THAT BY- EIGHTY THREE

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:11.373
NINETY EIGHT- MY FIRST QUESTION.

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:13.942
IS REALLY LOOKING AT. SORT OF

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.744
WHERE WE'RE HEADED IN THE NEAR

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:18.380
TERM. AND YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:20.549
ABOUT TARGETS AND GOALS- AND I

01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:22.017
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO SORT

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:24.085
OF INFORM THIS IS MARKET BASED

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:25.787
REDUCTION CONVERSATION THE CAP

01:20:25.854 --> 01:20:30.091
AND TRADE CONVERSATION BUT- I

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:34.062
THINK IF WE END UP AT THE ESPY

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:38.400
3240% GOAL- BY TWENTY THIRTY.

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:39.701
BUT WE HAVEN'T TRANSFORMED

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:43.505
CALIFORNIA. I WILL FAILED THE

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:45.707
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND I LOOK

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.642
AT THE YOU KNOW WHEN WE SET

01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:49.678
THOSE NUMBERS IN LAW BACK THEN

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:51.713
THERE'S A LOT WE DIDN'T KNOW. TO

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:53.815
MR BURR TRUST POINT ABOUT SOCIAL

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:56.184
COST OF CARBON. WHATEVER THAT

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:57.786
REGRESSION ANALYSIS OR WHATEVER

01:20:57.852 --> 01:20:59.588
WE THINK THAT PEOPLE CAN BEAR TO

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:02.257
AFFORD WHO ARE NOW UNDER WATER

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:03.992
AND HAUSER HAD THEIR COMMUNITIES

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:05.293
BURNED DOWN OR HAD THEIR

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.661
BUSINESSES GO UP IN SMOKE OR

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:08.396
LOST THEIR LIVES LIKE. THAT

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:10.298
SOCIAL COST ACTUALLY IS A LOT

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:12.567
HIGHER THAN WE OFTEN ESTIMATE.

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:13.535
SO I KNOW THE BITE

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:16.071
ADMINISTRATION IS SET. GOALS

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:19.007
NATIONWIDE- FOR TWENTY THIRTY

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:20.375
THAT ARE ACTUALLY MORE

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:21.610
AGGRESSIVE THAN WHAT

01:21:21.676 --> 01:21:23.578
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN LOOKING AT I

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:25.747
THINK. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FIT

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:27.482
THEY'RE FAR AND IN OUR LOWER AND

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:29.084
I THINK YOU COULD BE ALMOST AS

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:33.021
MUCH AS 10% MORE. PRODUCTIONS-

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:35.390
SET OUT A GOAL FOR THE FOR THE

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:36.992
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND WE

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:38.193
LIKE TO PRIDE OURSELVES ON BEING

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.595
LEADERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:43.131
GUESS I'M WONDERING. IF THERE'S

01:21:43.198 --> 01:21:47.235
ANY HOPE FOR GOING FASTER AND

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:49.004
FOR THE KIND OF NO REGRETS

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:50.205
INVESTMENTS AND TRANSFORMATIONS

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:52.207
THAT. I THINK WE'RE ON THE VERGE

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:55.143
OF ACHIEVING HERE- IN THE NEAR

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:57.646
TERM IN CALIFORNIA SO IS THERE

01:21:57.712 --> 01:21:59.214
JUST AT A HIGH LEVEL ANY

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:02.050
PERSPECTIVE- OR ANY HOPE TO GIVE

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:04.519
US HERE THAT. GOOD WE CAN TACKLE

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:06.588
THIS EMERGENCY AND OF COURSE WE

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.423
HAVE TO MODEL OUT TO DID YOU

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:10.358
KNOW TWO DECADES FROM NOW BUT

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:11.626
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T BREATHE

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:14.996
TODAY- WELL HOPE CAN YOU. YOUR

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:19.100
YOUR LENDERS HERE. IS THAT GO TO

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:21.102
THE SECRETARY OF THE STATE FAIR

01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:23.672
BOARD CHAIR AT THE GATES ON THAT

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:25.740
ONE AND I THINK YOU HAD YOUR

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:29.244
HAND UP TESTING. RIGHT I THINK

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:34.182
THERE IS- THERE IS A LOT TO BE

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:35.417
HOPEFUL ABOUT THAT CALIFORNIA

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:38.653
HAS VERY SPECIFIC ACTIONABLE

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.489
STRATEGIES- TO GET WHERE WE NEED

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:44.659
TO GO- LOOKING AT THE ENERGY

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:47.228
SECTOR FOR INSTANCE- THE

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:49.331
PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE HAS

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:52.500
BEEN DRAMATIC AND- AND

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:57.305
CONTINUES- WE ARE THE LARGEST-

ENERGY STORAGE- IN ANY

ON PAGE EIGHTY ONE OF THE

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:09.183
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT WHAT IT

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:12.353

HEALING SO I WOULD I WOULD TEND

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.393
TO AGREE WITH YOU I JUST FROM A

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.128
FROM A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE

01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:56.497
I GUESS I'M I'M TRYING TO

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:59.701
UNDERSTAND. DO WE HAVE- A

01:28:59.767 --> 01:29:03.604
QUANTIFIABLE HOPE OF EXCEEDING

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:05.506
THE TALK THE CURRENT TWENTY

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:07.542
THIRTY TARGETS IF WE SAY REALIZE

01:29:07.608 --> 01:29:09.544
ALL THESE INVESTMENTS AND PURSUE

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:12.246
ALL THE OTHER DIRECT MEASURES AS

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:14.615
WELL AS A WELL MANAGED CAP AND

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:17.285
TRADE PROGRAM IS THERE IS THAT A

01:29:17.351 --> 01:29:18.686
IS THAT A SCENARIO THAT THE

01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:21.656
ADMINISTRATION FINDS THAT LIKELY

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:24.058
OR OR POTENTIALLY LIKELY

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:26.094
REASONABLY LIKELY THAT WE COULD

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.062
WE COULD CHECK IN AT J. RANDALL

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:29.797
CAN ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE THIS IS

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:31.232
EXACTLY WHAT COPS GETTING IN THE

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:34.202
SCOPING PLAN. IS TO SCENARIO OUT

01:29:34.268 --> 01:29:35.002
AND JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR THE

01:29:35.069 --> 01:29:38.172
GOVERNOR INSTRUCTED ALL OF US-

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:40.641
HE AND BILLY AND DISCUSS THIS

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:42.810
VERY CLEARLY WHICH IS NO LATER

01:29:42.877 --> 01:29:44.979
THAN TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO COBB

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.380
IS DOING SCENARIO PLANNING TO

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:48.049
LOOK AT HOW AGGRESSIVELY TO

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:52.186
BRING THOSE NUMBERS. DOWN BUT

01:29:52.253 --> 01:29:53.221
I'LL TURN IT J. RANDALL- YES

01:29:53.287 --> 01:29:55.356
THAT'S CORRECT M. S. WE ARE

01:29:55.423 --> 01:29:57.225
LOOKING AT- SCENARIOS THAT

01:29:57.291 --> 01:30:00.962
INCLUDE- TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND

01:30:01.028 --> 01:30:03.531
TWENTY FORTY FIVE- I THINK ONE

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:04.665
AREA THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:06.801
IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS IS THAT THE

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:10.004
M. ALICE'S WILL INCLUDE. SOME

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:11.906
ANALYSIS AROUND UNCERTAINTIES

01:30:11.973 --> 01:30:14.642
AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT NO ONE

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.544
INDIVIDUAL AND NO OR NO ONE

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:19.080
ENTITY CONTROLS IN TERMS OF

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:21.349
IMPLEMENTING OUR STRATEGIES-

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:23.017
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AS

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:24.452
SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL MENTIONED

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:26.587
THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE WHERE-

01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:29.257
IT'S REALLY GOING TO DEPEND ON A

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:31.959
LOT OF WORK STATEWIDE- LOCAL

01:30:32.026 --> 01:30:34.495
GOVERNMENTS- AND REGIONAL

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:36.964
GOVERNMENTS TO. CONSIDER THE

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:38.633
LAND USE POLICIES THAT WILL

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:41.502
RESULT IN- IN A REDUCTION IN

01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:45.940
RELIANCE ON. VEHICLES ANOTHER

01:30:46.007 --> 01:30:47.775
EXAMPLE IS RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:50.978
DEPLOYMENT- AS THESE PROJECTS

01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:53.881
NEED TO BE BUILT- AND THEY NEED

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:55.383
TO BE LOCATED AND BECOME

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:57.952
OPERATIONAL- AND SO WE NEED TO

01:30:58.019 --> 01:31:01.355
MAKE SURE THAT. THE RATE OF

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:03.624

THAT YOU MENTIONED- IT

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.032
ESPECIALLY IN THE INDUSTRIAL

01:32:18.099 --> 01:32:21.869
SECTOR SAW DIRECT EMISSION

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:24.038
INCREASES- AS THE LAST COPING

01:32:24.105 --> 01:32:25.039
PLAN UPDATE I'M THINKING OF

01:32:25.106 --> 01:32:27.108
SPECIFICALLY IN REFINING AND

01:32:27.174 --> 01:32:30.578
CEMENT- I KNOW THAT THIS WAS A-

01:32:30.645 --> 01:32:33.748
PARTICULARLY ACUTE FOCUS- FOR. A

AND TRADE IN THEIR PARTICULAR

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:45.927
COMMUNITIES- IDEAS HAVE BEEN PUT

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:48.763
FORWARD LIKE- NO TREATING ZONES

01:32:48.829 --> 01:32:51.065
OR OTHER WAYS. THROUGH CAP AND

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:52.466
TRADE BUT I ALSO KNOW THERE'S

01:32:52.533 --> 01:32:53.301
SORT OF DIRECT EMISSIONS

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:55.636
REDUCTION STRATEGIES AS WELL CAN

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:57.905
YOU CAN YOU WILL TOUCH ON- THE

01:32:57.972 --> 01:33:00.608
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND- THAT SORT

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:03.377
OF HARD TO REACH HIGH HEAT-

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:06.414
HIGH- YEAH THE HIGHLY

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.449
INDUSTRIALIZED INDUSTRIES THAT.

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:11.152
THAT HAVE SO FAR SORT OF-

01:33:11.218 --> 01:33:15.423
INVADED OUR ABILITY TO TRANSFORM

01:33:15.489 --> 01:33:20.027
AND FIND A NEW WAY. I GUESS I

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:24.332
WILL KICK **** AND NOTES THAT-

01:33:24.398 --> 01:33:27.435
THERE ARE- DIRECTED MISSIONS-

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:29.236
REGULATORY OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:32.840
STATIONARY SOURCES- AND- AND I

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:34.775

01:33:40.047 --> 01:33:43.050
QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT-

01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:45.186
AND- IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE

01:33:45.252 --> 01:33:46.587
THE IMPORTANCE OF STRATEGIES

01:33:46.654 --> 01:33:48.356
LIKE A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:51.993
TO. DRIVE INNOVATION AND DEVELOP

01:33:52.059 --> 01:33:55.563
RENEWABLE FUELS THAT REDUCE.

01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:57.832
EMISSIONS IN SECTORS THAT ARE

01:33:57.898 --> 01:34:00.267
HARD TO ELECTRIFY. I THINK

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:03.571
THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES THERE- BUT

01:34:03.637 --> 01:34:05.139
YOU KNOW I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT

01:34:05.206 --> 01:34:06.507
WE NEED TO BE CLEAR EYED ABOUT

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:08.709
RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:11.612
THAT. PARTICULAR USES AND

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.914
INDUSTRIAL PROCESS SEES THAT-

ARE GOING TO NEED. MORE WORK AND

01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:19.320
MORE INNOVATION AND I THINK WE-

01:34:19.387 --> 01:34:22.089
ARE. TRYING TO DRIVE THAT NOT

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:25.926
JUST THROUGH- CAP AND TRADE BUT-

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:28.462
THREE WELL CSS- AND THROUGH

01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:33.267

TO- THAT TO BRING THE LOCAL- AND

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.305
ZERO CARBON STRATEGIES TO THOSE

01:34:38.372 --> 01:34:44.245

IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION FOR.

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:54.048
SURE BEYOND OUR PORTFOLIO TO

FOR THE STAGE OVERALL GREENHOUSE

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:07.354
PREVENT BACKSLIDING. BY

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:10.157
MAINTAINING- OF A MODEST CARBON

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:12.726
PRICE IN THE IN THE PROGRAM AND

01:37:12.793 --> 01:37:15.896
GOING FORWARD MY G. YOU KNOW MY

01:37:15.963 --> 01:37:17.965
PROFESSIONAL THE REAL STEP WHAT

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:19.333
REALLY HAS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.268
DRIVE CHANGES IN THE HARD TRUTH

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:22.636
IS A SO CALLED HARD TO OBEY

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:24.271
TRACTORS ARE NOT EVEN INCLUDES

01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:26.507
TRANSPORTATION OF COURSE. BUT

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:28.709
ESPECIALLY INDUSTRY IS. REALLY

01:37:28.776 --> 01:37:30.878
PRIVATE INVESTMENT I MEAN PUBLIC

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:32.279
SECTOR INVESTMENT IS VERY

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:35.049
IMPORTANT BUT IT IS ONLY USEFUL

01:37:35.115 --> 01:37:37.117
ULTIMATELY AFFECT LEVERAGES MANY

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:38.619
FOLD MORE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.120
INVESTMENT AND RE DIRECT THOUGHT

01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:42.256
PRIVATE SECTOR DRUNK AND BACKS.

01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:43.157
AWAY FROM WHERE IT'S GOING TO

01:37:43.224 --> 01:37:44.959
HAPPEN ANYWHERE IN ANY WAY INTO

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:47.094
CLEAN TECHNOLOGY IN THE ENERGY

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:49.930
TRANSFORMATION THAT WE NEED SO I

01:37:49.997 --> 01:37:52.166
THINK THAT THERE ARE POLICIES IN

01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:53.867
ADDITION TO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO

01:37:53.934 --> 01:37:55.135
SEE A STRENGTHENING OF THE

01:37:55.202 --> 01:38:00.140
CARBON. MARKET AND A

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:01.041
STRENGTHENING OF THE CARBON

01:38:01.108 --> 01:38:01.942
PRICE. I SHOULD THAT THERE ARE

01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:04.445
POLICY WHAT SURE. MAY BELOW CARB

01:38:04.511 --> 01:38:06.213
STANDARD IS A- IS A REALLY

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.581
PROBLEMS TEMPLE THAT COULD. USED

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:08.882
AS A TERM AS A BUY. CENTER

01:38:08.949 --> 01:38:11.719
CHURCH FOR STANDARD THE LOOK AT

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:13.587
A MATCH OR OTHER ADULT SECTOR.

01:38:13.654 --> 01:38:15.756
BECAUSE IT IS A REMARKABLE

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:17.258
ATTRIBUTE OF THESE OF THIS KIND

01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:19.159
OF TRAVEL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:20.961
IS IT REALLY DRIVES INNOVATION

01:38:21.028 --> 01:38:23.130
AND REALLY DRIVES INVESTMENT IN

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:24.932
THE SECTOR IS WORTH HAVING A

01:38:24.999 --> 01:38:27.201
RELATIVELY MODEST EFFECT. ON OUR

01:38:27.268 --> 01:38:29.169
CONSUMER PRICES DOWNSTREAM. SO

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:31.605
IT'S NOT THE HOLY GRAIL TUNA

01:38:31.672 --> 01:38:33.240
CONOCE CARBON PRICING IS THE

01:38:33.307 --> 01:38:35.376
HOLY GRAIL BUT IT COMES WITH ITS

01:38:35.442 --> 01:38:37.778
OWN LIMITATIONS AND SO I THINK.

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:39.380
THE IDEA OF HOLISTICALLY LOOKING

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:40.648
AT INTEGRATING THESE DIFFERENT

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:42.416
TYPES OF POLICY PROPOSALS.

01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:44.351
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:51.358
A R. B. TO BE DIRECT. DR CONCORD

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:52.326
. THANK SENATOR. I YOU KNOW. I

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:53.827
WAS REFLECTING LISTENING TO

01:38:53.894 --> 01:38:55.629
SECRETARY BLUMENFELD TOUT THE

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:57.197
STATE'S LEADERSHIP ESPECIALLY IN

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:58.999
BUDGET MATTERS ENSURE RANDALL'S

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:00.467
VIEWS ONTHE STATE'S LEADERSHIP

01:39:00.534 --> 01:39:02.536
IN THE ENERGY SECTORS. I THINK

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:04.004
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL TO BE PROUD

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:05.873
OF AND TO BRAG ABOUT TO THE

01:39:05.939 --> 01:39:07.041
WORLD. I THINK IF YOU LOOK

01:39:07.107 --> 01:39:07.708
CAREFULLY AT THE EXPERIENCE OF

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:09.009
REAL CLIMATE LEADERS IT'S

01:39:09.076 --> 01:39:10.711
USUALLY SECTOR SPECIFIC POLICIES

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:12.279
AND INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY THAT

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:13.380
GETS A LOT OF THE WORK DONE AND

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:14.515
I CELEBRATE. EVERYONE'S

01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:15.783
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THAT FIELD

01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:16.984
HERE I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:18.952
FIND THE CAP AND TRADE. IS GOING

01:39:19.019 --> 01:39:19.820
TO BE THE PRIMARY WAY TO GET

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:21.388
THINGS DONE I THINK THEY'RE

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:22.456
STRONG ECONOMIC RATIONALES TO

01:39:22.523 --> 01:39:25.225
MAKE AS MUCH OF IT IS WE CAN.

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:26.427
HAPPEN AND I JOINED ALLISON IS

01:39:26.493 --> 01:39:28.562
VERY THOUGHTFUL REMARKS ABOUT

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:29.863
THAT BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.031
WORLD DANCING RISE WE HAVE THE

01:39:31.098 --> 01:39:32.900
SCOPE AND PLAN THAT SAYS MOST OF

01:39:32.966 --> 01:39:34.601
THE WORK IS GOING TO BE DONE MY

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:36.203
CAP AND TRADE. WE DO NOT HAVE A

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:37.538
CAP TRADE PROGRAM THAT'S CAPABLE

01:39:37.604 --> 01:39:38.205
OF DOING THAT RIGHT NOW. AND THE

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:39.840
POLITICS OF REFORMING THAT ARE

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:41.141
VERY DIFFICULT. SO I WELCOME ANY

01:39:41.208 --> 01:39:42.676
DEVELOPMENTS ABOUT STRENGTHENING

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:43.744
OUR BUDGET MEASURES BETTER

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:45.079
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ABOUT OUR

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:46.313
INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY ABOUT

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.448
EFFORTS TO REFORM THE CAP AND

01:39:47.514 --> 01:39:48.349
TRADE PROGRAM I THINK WE

01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:49.917
PROBABLY NEED ALL OF IT. THANK

01:39:49.983 --> 01:39:51.618
YOU FOR TAKING A REALISTIC LOOK

01:39:51.685 --> 01:39:52.986
THE MOST AMBITIOUS CARBON

01:39:53.053 --> 01:39:54.288
PRICING JURISDICTIONS IN THE

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:55.356
WORLD LIKE THE EUROPEAN UNION

01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:56.890
WHICH HAVE PRICES FOUR TIMES

01:39:56.957 --> 01:39:58.325
OURS. ARE STILL RELYING VERY

01:39:58.392 --> 01:39:59.693
HEAVILY ON INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.128
AND THAT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:02.096
GOING TO BE THE WAY THAT WE LEAD

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:03.630
AND SUCCEED. HOPEFULLY WE DO IT

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:05.766
ALL TOGETHER AND THE THING THAT

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:08.202
I THINK JUST. KEEPS ME UP AT

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:09.870
NIGHT IS WE CAN'T HAVE AN HONEST

01:40:09.937 --> 01:40:10.637
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CAP AND

01:40:10.704 --> 01:40:12.039
TRADE PROGRAM IS WORKING AND

01:40:12.106 --> 01:40:13.540
THAT'S BEEN THE CASE SINCE I

01:40:13.607 --> 01:40:16.910
STARTED WORKING ON THE SYSTEM.

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:18.846
MANY MANY YEARS AGO- RANDOLPH-

01:40:18.912 --> 01:40:20.514
I'LL JUST SAY A COUPLE THINGS-

01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:23.684
FIRST- YOU KNOW I THINK WE NEED

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:26.353
TO RECOGNIZE THAT- CAP AND TRADE

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:28.756
IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN OUR

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:31.692
PORTFOLIO WE HAVE A RANGE OF

01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:35.496
REGULATORY- IN SENATE REGULATORY

01:40:35.562 --> 01:40:36.897
PROGRAMS INCENTIVE BASED

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:38.799
PROGRAMS CAP AND TRADE ALL OF

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:41.368
THEM CREATE- A SUITE OF

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:43.203
STRATEGIES TO GET TO OUR GOALS

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:45.172
AND I DO WANT TO CLARIFY EARLIER

01:40:45.239 --> 01:40:46.507
YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE HAVING A

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:47.908
DISCUSSION WITH SENATOR DOLLY

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:49.543
ABOUT THAT TWENTY THIRTY

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:51.712
DEADLINE. THE CAP AND TRADE

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:56.083
PROGRAM AS PRESCRIBED BY AB

01:40:56.150 --> 01:40:57.117
THREE NINETY EIGHT IS WHAT

01:40:57.184 --> 01:40:59.620
EXPIRES IN TWENTY THIRTY- BUT WE

01:40:59.686 --> 01:41:01.555
STILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO HAVE

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:03.690
A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM UNDER AB

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:04.858
THIRTY TWO AND SO THAT IS WHY

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:06.326
THE SCOPING PLAN IN ITS

01:41:06.393 --> 01:41:11.031
ANALYSIS- WILL- ASSUME THAT A

01:41:11.098 --> 01:41:13.200
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM CONTINUES-

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:15.235
THE ON TWENTY THIRTY INTO- OUR

01:41:15.302 --> 01:41:18.205
GOALS FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY-

01:41:18.272 --> 01:41:20.908
AND- AND THEN I WILL ALSO NOTE

01:41:20.974 --> 01:41:24.578
THAT YOU KNOW. HE THE QUESTION

01:41:24.645 --> 01:41:27.181
OF HOW MUCH- THE CAP AND TRADE

01:41:27.247 --> 01:41:29.950
PROGRAM WILL AND BE EXPECTED TO

01:41:30.017 --> 01:41:32.119
DO THIS LIFTING TO TWENTY THIRTY

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:33.787
AND BEYOND WILL BE PART OF THE

01:41:33.854 --> 01:41:36.190
ANALYSIS IN THIS CAMPAIGN PLAN-

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:38.692
AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT ALL OF

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.561
THESE PROGRAMS AND HOW THEY FIT

01:41:40.627 --> 01:41:42.129
TOGETHER AND ASSESSING WHAT THE

01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:45.132
RULE OF CAP AND TRADE WILL BE

01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:47.634
AND- YOU KNOW WE ABSOLUTELY GET

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:49.169
ADVOCACY ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:50.771
ISSUE RIGHT WE GET ADVOCACY

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:52.806
THAT. THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:55.442
SHOULD PLAY A LARGER ROLE AND-

01:41:55.509 --> 01:41:58.846
AND IT AND IT CAN PROVIDE MORE

01:41:58.912 --> 01:42:00.614
COST EFFECTIVE REDUCTIONS WE GET

01:42:00.681 --> 01:42:03.851
ADVOCACY N THE OTHER SIDE THAT-

01:42:03.917 --> 01:42:06.253
IT SHOULD NOT PLAY A LARGE ROLE-

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:09.389
AND THAT- A MARKET BASED PROGRAM

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:11.391
SHOULD HAVE A LESSER ROLE AND

01:42:11.458 --> 01:42:14.461
DIRECT AND- EMISSIONS

01:42:14.528 --> 01:42:20.100
REGULATIONS. SHOULD HAVE A

01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:21.201
GREATER ROLE- AND THE ISSUES

01:42:21.268 --> 01:42:22.803
WILL ON A AND- IN THE SKY

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:24.137
PLANNING WILL WE WILL A FULL

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:25.339
PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS.

01:42:25.405 --> 01:42:27.274
PLAN ITSELF AND IMPORTANTLY-

01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:29.676
WHEN THAT IS DONE WE WILL HAVE A

01:42:29.743 --> 01:42:31.178
FULL. REGULATORY DISCUSSION

01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:32.713
ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE CAP

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:35.349
AND TRADE PROGRAM AS IT EXISTS

01:42:35.415 --> 01:42:38.051
AND WE WILL TACKLE- AND THESE.

01:42:38.118 --> 01:42:40.687
THESE ARE CRITICAL ISSUES- THAT

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:42.823
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. IT

01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:46.093
TODAY'S HEARING SO I JUST WANTED

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:50.197
TO CLARIFY THAT. MR BROWN. YEAH

01:42:50.264 --> 01:42:52.232
I JUST WANTED TO OFFER I GUESS

01:42:52.299 --> 01:42:54.735
MY TWO CENTS ON THE CENTER'S

01:42:54.801 --> 01:42:56.870
QUESTIONS- I MEAN I THINK- FROM

01:42:56.937 --> 01:42:58.305
OUR PERSPECTIVE THE WAY THE

01:42:58.372 --> 01:43:00.541
PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY DESIGNS.

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:02.509
IT'S JUST NOT DESIGNED TO KIND

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:04.077
OF ENSURE THAT THE STATE NEEDS

01:43:04.144 --> 01:43:05.512
IT'S TWENTY THIRTY GOALS NOT

01:43:05.579 --> 01:43:07.247
SORT OF I THINK A BIG PART OF

01:43:07.314 --> 01:43:08.715
THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:10.751
HAVING- SO FAR HERE TODAY- AND

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:13.120
SO. THERE'S A VERY REAL RESPECT

01:43:13.186 --> 01:43:13.921
SORT OF UNDER THE CURRENT DESIGN

01:43:13.987 --> 01:43:15.489
IT'S JUST NOT NOT GOING TO KIND

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:16.590
OF PROVIDE THAT INSURANCE

01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:18.325
ASSURANCE AND SO THE KEY

01:43:18.392 --> 01:43:19.426
QUESTION I THINK FOR THE

01:43:19.493 --> 01:43:20.360
LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE

01:43:20.427 --> 01:43:22.229
OVERALL IS WHAT TYPE OF ROLE IS

01:43:22.296 --> 01:43:24.298
AT ONCE- THE ROUTE THE CAP AND

01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:26.300
TRADE PROGRAM TO PLAY. GOING

01:43:26.366 --> 01:43:27.935
FORWARD- I THINK FROM OUR

01:43:28.001 --> 01:43:29.870
PERSPECTIVE. THERE IS JUST A

01:43:29.937 --> 01:43:32.940
VERY STRONG- RATIONALE FOR

01:43:33.006 --> 01:43:36.543
CONCENTRATING ON THE MOST COST

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:38.378
EFFECTIVE. ROACH STREET. AND BY

01:43:38.445 --> 01:43:39.379
. IT ALSO MEANS YOU KNOW A LOT

01:43:39.446 --> 01:43:40.881
OF THOSE COSTS ARE CAN BE VERY

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:42.749
VISIBLE AND WE TALKED ABOUT KIND

01:43:42.816 --> 01:43:44.651
OF SHELL GASOLINE PRICES AND

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:45.586
OTHER THINGS. LIKE THAT- THAT

01:43:45.652 --> 01:43:46.887
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE OVERALL

01:43:46.954 --> 01:43:48.455
COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN OTHER

01:43:48.522 --> 01:43:50.223
PROGRAMS WE DO THINK THAT THERE

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:51.858
PROBABLY LESS THAN A LOT OF THE

01:43:51.925 --> 01:43:52.759
OTHER ALTERNATIVES BUT THERE'S-

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:54.294
A LOT OF CONSIDERATIONS OF

01:43:54.361 --> 01:43:55.195
WHETHER SOCIAL LAUGHED AWAY AND

01:43:55.262 --> 01:43:56.830
THINKING ABOUT. HOW MUCH THE WAY

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:58.298
KIND OF THAT. SORT OF COST

01:43:58.365 --> 01:43:59.866
EFFECTIVE OVERALL.

01:43:59.933 --> 01:44:01.435
CONSIDERATIONS WITH OTHER THINGS

01:44:01.501 --> 01:44:02.769
LIKE- BENEFITS AND HOW THOSE

01:44:02.836 --> 01:44:04.204
COSTS ARE DISTRIBUTED WHAT KIND

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:06.173
OF MAKING A DECISION ABOUT WHAT

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:07.708
ROLE IT WANTS TO CONCENTRATE

01:44:07.774 --> 01:44:09.176
PROGRAM. TO PLAY AND I DID JUST

01:44:09.242 --> 01:44:11.011
WANT TO KNOW AND ONE OTHER THING

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:11.745
AND THAT. IN THE CONVERSATION

01:44:11.812 --> 01:44:13.580
AROUND INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS. I

01:44:13.647 --> 01:44:15.415
WANT TO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:44:15.482 --> 01:44:16.183
PROPOSED BUDGET THIS YEAR

01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:18.752
INCLUDES. TWO HUNDRED AND TEN

01:44:18.819 --> 01:44:19.853
MILLION DOLLARS FOR KIND OF A

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.688
NEW INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:22.589
PROGRAMME AT THE ENERGY

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:24.491
COMMISSION I THINK IN LARGE PART

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:28.428
TO. EXPLORE NEWER TECHNOLOGIES

01:44:28.495 --> 01:44:30.564
IN THAT AREA GIVE AND I THINK A

01:44:30.631 --> 01:44:31.531
LOT OF THE CHALLENGES AROUND

01:44:31.598 --> 01:44:32.432
KIND OF WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE

01:44:32.499 --> 01:44:34.835
IN THAT AREA SO- I THINK OVERALL

01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:36.770
I THINK THAT'S A- REASONABLE.

01:44:36.837 --> 01:44:37.871
ROLE FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN THE

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:39.706
STATE TO PLAY THAT KIND OF TRY

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:41.508
TO EXPLORE AND PILOT AND TEST

01:44:41.575 --> 01:44:42.909
AND DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THOSE.

01:44:42.976 --> 01:44:45.679
NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THOSE AREAS-

01:44:45.746 --> 01:44:47.414
WHERE THE SOLUTIONS ARE MUCH

01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:48.849
MORE DIFFICULT AND SO I DID JUST

01:44:48.915 --> 01:44:50.150
WANT TO KIND OF. KNOW THAT AS A

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:51.952
AS A KIND OF ANOTHER PIECE OF

01:44:52.019 --> 01:44:52.986
THAT THE STRATEGY THAT MIGHT

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:54.221
WORK IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER

01:44:54.287 --> 01:45:01.528
ROLE COUNTRY. PROGRAM A COUNTRY

01:45:01.595 --> 01:45:03.497
PLACE. THANK FOR THANKS TO

01:45:03.563 --> 01:45:04.031
EVERYBODY THANK YOU MISS

01:45:04.097 --> 01:45:06.299
CHAIRMAN. THAT COME. TEXT ALL

01:45:06.366 --> 01:45:09.202
RIGHT- WELL. THAT I GUESS I HAVE

01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:10.270
A COUPLE. ON WHETHER THINGS ARE

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:13.006
RIGHT OR LEGAL OR IF WE'RE-

01:45:13.073 --> 01:45:18.779
DOING. ENOUGH- D. THE IDEA OF

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:20.580
ROLLING OVER THE ALLOWANCES WAS

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:23.784
A BIG. BIG PROBLEM IN THE

01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:25.719
EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE YOU

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:27.421
KNOW THAT WAS A POLICY DECISION

01:45:27.487 --> 01:45:28.822
THAT WAS MADE BY THE PREVIOUS

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:30.791
ADMINISTRATION AND I RECOGNIZE

01:45:30.857 --> 01:45:32.859
THAT THE SECRETARY AND THE CHAIR

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:35.662
INHERITED DEBT BUT THIS IS NOT A

01:45:35.729 --> 01:45:37.831
NEW DEBATE THAT'S COME OUT WITH

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:41.435
THE WITH THE- IRAQ REPORT AND- I

01:45:41.501 --> 01:45:42.703
WAS HERE WHEN THAT HEARING I

01:45:42.769 --> 01:45:44.471
WAS. I CONDUCTED THE HEARING FOR

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:46.973
GOD SAKES ON THE APPROVAL AND WE

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.341
WILL THE REPRESENTATIONS WITH

01:45:48.408 --> 01:45:50.177
THAT- AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT

01:45:50.243 --> 01:45:52.446
MAYBE A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION-

01:45:52.512 --> 01:45:54.247

ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:21.234
SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK INTO

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:24.938
AND THE PROPOSAL IS REALLY TO

01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:27.073
UNDERSTAND ONCE. WE HAVE

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:29.309

01:47:31.478 --> 01:47:34.548
OF THAT ECONOMIC TRAJECTORIES-

01:47:34.614 --> 01:47:36.216
OUR COVERAGE AND HOW THAT

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:38.218
IMPACTS THE MISSIONS THAT WE

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:41.054
LOOK AT THIS ISSUE. AND GET BACK

01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:42.989
TO THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS-

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:44.958
CHAIR RANDOLPH WENT THROUGH AND

01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:46.426
THEN GET DETAIL ON THAT

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:48.929
POWERPOINT PRESENTATION AND- THE

01:47:48.995 --> 01:47:52.199
DIFFERENT- REDUCTIONS- FROM

01:47:52.265 --> 01:47:54.467
EIGHT TO FULL. HELLO ALL THE

01:47:54.534 --> 01:47:56.002
OTHER WAY RATHER THAN THE FULL

01:47:56.069 --> 01:47:57.304
PERCENT REDUCTIONS THAT WE'RE

01:47:57.370 --> 01:47:59.673
CURRENTLY- SEEING AS A RESULT

01:47:59.739 --> 01:48:05.512
OF- EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT-

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:07.047
SO. WE YOU KNOW THE FROM AN

01:48:07.113 --> 01:48:08.715
ECONOMIC AND I THINK THAT YOU

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:11.384
BUT TROLL DESCRIBE THIS AND

01:48:11.451 --> 01:48:13.453
MAYBE WILL DO SO AGAIN. IT IS

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:15.088
HARD TO TELL IS IT TOO BIG

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:17.424
EITHER TOO MANY OTHER TWO TWO WE

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:19.192
DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ABILITY TO

PINPOINT THAT- CHAIR LIKE HOW

01:48:21.428 --> 01:48:23.663
SKI AND SO. I THINK WHAT WE'RE

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:27.500
PROPOSING IS- YES. WHERE WE

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:29.102
LOOKING AT THIS WITH THAT

01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:30.337
TENSION BUT I THINK IT THE

01:48:30.403 --> 01:48:32.105
STATUS AND I CERTAINLY

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:34.541

01:48:34.608 --> 01:48:36.776
INTENDING TO LIFT IT UP AND GIVE

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:38.044
IT THE ATTENTION THAT IT

01:48:38.111 --> 01:48:39.813
DESERVES AT THE MOMENT I DON'T

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.915
THINK I'M- RIGHT A PLACE WHERE

01:48:41.982 --> 01:48:44.384
WE SAY WE NEED TO TAKE. AND WE

01:48:44.451 --> 01:48:46.920
WILL BE TAKING ACTION ACTION TO

01:48:46.987 --> 01:48:49.789
JUST SIMPLY CHANGE THINGS YOU

01:48:49.856 --> 01:48:51.858

BE DONE AND THEN COMING. TO YOU

01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:03.870
AFTER DOING A PUBLIC PROCESS-

01:49:03.937 --> 01:49:09.309
THROUGH COBB. THAT WOULD- LOOK

01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:10.744
AT. POTENTIAL INTENT I JUST

01:49:10.810 --> 01:49:13.847
CHECKS. THAT COULD. BE ADOPTED

01:49:13.914 --> 01:49:16.349
BY YOU- AND THE LEGISLATURE I'M

01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:18.919
SORRY. CURRENT OFFER GUESS WHAT

01:49:18.985 --> 01:49:20.320
YOU'RE THINKING WHAT METRICS DO

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:22.222
YOU USE WHEN YOU DETERMINE I

01:49:22.289 --> 01:49:24.658
WE'VE WE'VE HEARD FROM. OUR

01:49:24.724 --> 01:49:27.460
ESTEEMED SCHOLARS WHAT METRICS

01:49:27.527 --> 01:49:29.996
DO YOU USE TO DETERMINE HOW MANY

01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:31.698
WHAT'S THE RUSH WHAT'S THE RIGHT

01:49:31.765 --> 01:49:33.400
FIX AND WHAT WE JUST CONTINUE.

01:49:33.466 --> 01:49:35.001
AND WE'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:37.604
YEARS OF POLLUTION IN THEN.

01:49:37.671 --> 01:49:41.641
BANKED ALLOWANCES. WHAT CAN YOU

01:49:41.708 --> 01:49:43.343
SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT. YEAH I

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:44.844
MEAN I GUESS I WOULD START OFF

01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:49.015
pBY SAYING- THAT DOES ALL- IT ALL

01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:51.985
BOILS DOWN TO THE INVENTORY AND

01:49:52.052 --> 01:49:53.386
UNDERSTANDING ARE WE SEEING

01:49:53.453 --> 01:49:55.889
REDUCTIONS HAPPEN- AND WE

01:49:55.956 --> 01:49:58.291
CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THAT EVERY

01:49:58.358 --> 01:50:01.194
YEAR AND ASSESS YOU KNOW ARE WE

01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:02.862
REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS

01:50:02.929 --> 01:50:05.765
EMISSIONS- AND AT THIS TIME THE

01:50:05.832 --> 01:50:09.102
ANSWER TO THAT IS YES- AND- YOU

01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:11.004
KNOW WE HAVE TAKEN MEASURES AS I

01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:13.540
DISCUSSED IN MY PRESENTATION- IN

01:50:13.606 --> 01:50:14.741
TERMS OF THE SELF RATCHETING

01:50:14.808 --> 01:50:17.177
MECHANISM- AND REMOVING

01:50:17.243 --> 01:50:18.278
ALLOWANCES FROM GENERAL

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:21.314
CIRCULATION. PER AT EIGHTY THREE

01:50:21.381 --> 01:50:24.985
NINETY EIGHT- AND- AND WE WILL

01:50:25.051 --> 01:50:28.088
CONTINUE TO ASSESS- THIS PROGRAM

01:50:28.154 --> 01:50:30.457
THAT LITERALLY STARTED ONE YEAR

01:50:30.523 --> 01:50:32.058
AGO IN THE SENSE OF HOW IT IS

01:50:32.125 --> 01:50:35.095
CURRENTLY. STRUCTURED AND SO I

01:50:35.161 --> 01:50:36.296
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:39.699
UNDERSTAND- TO LOOK AT THE YOU

01:50:39.766 --> 01:50:43.069
KNOW THE CURRENT- ALLOWANCES AND

01:50:43.136 --> 01:50:47.374
THE CURRENT PROGRAM AND ASSESS-

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:49.376
YOU KNOW. AS I ALSO MENTIONED

01:50:49.442 --> 01:50:51.411
EARLIER WE DO SEE A STEADYING A

01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:54.180
STEADILY INCREASING- HIGH SIGNAL

01:50:54.247 --> 01:50:56.149
I THINK THAT THE CONCERNS RAISED

01:50:56.216 --> 01:50:58.318
BY THE COMMITTEE ARE REALLY

01:50:58.385 --> 01:51:00.286
IMPORTANT VALID CONCERNS THAT WE

01:51:00.353 --> 01:51:01.688
ABSOLUTELY NEED TO ROLL UP OUR

01:51:01.755 --> 01:51:04.124
SLEEVES AND EXAMINE- BUT I THINK

01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:06.493
IT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF.

01:51:06.559 --> 01:51:08.928
UNDERSTANDING HOW THE CHANGES

01:51:08.995 --> 01:51:10.997
WE'VE MADE MORE RECENTLY ARE

01:51:11.064 --> 01:51:14.667
PLAYING OUT- IT'S IN THE CONTEXT

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:16.836
OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE EXPECT

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:18.538
FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

01:51:18.605 --> 01:51:20.473
WITH REGARD TO OUR OVERALL

01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:22.742
EMISSIONS REDUCTION STRATEGY IN

01:51:22.809 --> 01:51:24.644
THE SCOPING PLAN. AND YOU KNOW

01:51:24.711 --> 01:51:26.913
IT'S A RECOGNITION THAT A MARKET

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:29.115
BASED PROGRAM NEEDS TO SEND SOME

01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:30.283
CONSISTENT SIGNALS TO THE

01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:33.853
MARKET- AS- YOU KNOW AS AS

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:35.789
DALLAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE

01:51:35.855 --> 01:51:38.324
IDEA OF SORT OF. PLANNED

01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:40.060
SYSTEMATIC PROGRAM REVIEWS WHERE

YOU ARE ASSESSING YOUR PROGRAM

01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:43.563

YOU NEED TO- TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

01:51:45.698 --> 01:51:47.400
NEED TO BE PART OF A ROBUST

01:51:47.467 --> 01:51:50.670
CONVERSATIONS AND IT NEEDS TO.

01:51:50.737 --> 01:51:53.106
NOT NECESSARILY BE. SOMETHING

01:51:53.173 --> 01:51:54.774
THAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW EVERY

01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:57.110
SINGLE YEAR OR OR MORE

01:51:57.177 --> 01:51:59.546
FREQUENTLY THAN IS NECESSARY SO

01:51:59.612 --> 01:52:01.314
I THINK YOU'RE HEARING BOTH FROM

THE ON THE PROGRAM BUT WE WOULD

01:52:18.098 --> 01:52:20.934
LIKE TO DO THAT. AFTER WE ASSESS

TRADE AS A PART OF OUR LARGER

01:52:24.904 --> 01:52:29.042
STRATEGY- AND THEN WORK BEGIN

01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:30.610
WORKING THAT PUBLIC PROCESS

01:52:30.677 --> 01:52:31.678
AFTER THIS COPING PLAN IS

ADOPTED- IN TERMS OF OUR-

01:52:35.148 --> 01:52:38.017
TYPICAL PRE REGULATORY WORKSHOPS

AND DISCUSSION. WITH

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:42.622

ADVOCACY FROM ALL. INTERESTED

01:52:48.962 --> 01:52:52.465
STAKEHOLDERS TO UNDERSTAND- HOW

01:52:52.532 --> 01:52:53.199
WE SHOULD ADDRESS THE PROGRAM

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:54.968
GOING FORWARD AND YOU DON'T HAVE

01:52:55.034 --> 01:52:56.769
ANY CONCERNS THAT YOU MIGHT BE

01:52:56.836 --> 01:52:58.805
WAITING TOO LONG SO THAT THERE

01:52:58.872 --> 01:53:01.074
MIGHT NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO

01:53:01.141 --> 01:53:05.512
CHANGE THE PROGRAM IN ORDER TO.

01:53:05.578 --> 01:53:06.479
TO MEET OUR OUR CLIMATE GOALS. A

01:53:06.546 --> 01:53:08.381
REDUCTION REDUCTION SHOULD STEP

01:53:08.448 --> 01:53:10.517
DOESN'T CONCERN YOU WITH ALL THE

01:53:10.583 --> 01:53:15.522
URGENCY. I HATE YOU KNOW GIVEN

01:53:15.588 --> 01:53:18.057
THAT WE HAVE- MADE RECENT

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:21.661
REDUCTIONS I THINK THAT- THERE

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:24.164
IS. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO ASSESS

01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:26.099
THOSE THOSE RECENT REDUCTIONS

01:53:26.166 --> 01:53:27.634
AND HOW AND WHAT THE EFFECT

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:31.004
THOSE HAVE- AND I THINK IT IS

01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:34.874
POSSIBLE TO INGEST- BETWEEN NOW

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:37.710
AND TWENTY THIRTY AND GOING

01:53:37.777 --> 01:53:40.413
FORWARD- IF IT'S DETERMINED THAT

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:44.551
THAT'S NEEDED AND NECESSARY- AND

01:53:44.617 --> 01:53:49.022
SO I DO THINK THAT WE CAN-

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:50.723
CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS TO

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:52.892
TILT TOWARDS OUR GOALS WHILE WE

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:55.762
UNDERSTAND- WHETHER OR NOT WE

01:53:55.828 --> 01:53:58.998
CAN MAKE. EVEN BETTER PROGRESS.

01:53:59.065 --> 01:54:00.600
DR CONVERGING AT YOUR HAND UP

01:54:00.667 --> 01:54:03.736
FOR SECOND. YEAH I JUST I WANTED

01:54:03.803 --> 01:54:05.305
TO CHIME IN BECAUSE I FIRST SAW

01:54:05.371 --> 01:54:07.373
THIS IS A VERY NASTY PROBLEM

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.942
THAT OUR POLICY MAKERS OF

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:12.312
INHERITED- S. AND I WANT TO READ

01:54:12.378 --> 01:54:13.980

01:54:14.047 --> 01:54:15.648
BEEN CRITICAL OF THE PROGRAM AND

01:54:15.715 --> 01:54:16.749
HE THINKS THERE'S A NEED TO

01:54:16.816 --> 01:54:18.785
REFORM IF EVERY POLICY MAKER THE

01:54:18.851 --> 01:54:20.153
GOVERNOR OF THE PRO TEM SPEAKER

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.688
OF THE ASSEMBLY SAID YOU'RE IN

01:54:21.754 --> 01:54:22.789
CHARGE GO FIGURE IT OUT. THE

01:54:22.855 --> 01:54:24.524
FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS

01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:25.325
CONDUCT A SERIOUS ANALYTICAL

01:54:25.391 --> 01:54:27.460
EXERCISE S. IS BEEN PROMISED IN

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:28.761
THIS COUPLE AND WE'VE NOT YET

01:54:28.828 --> 01:54:29.796
SEEN WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:31.664
BETTER IT'S BEEN ABOUT THE

01:54:31.731 --> 01:54:32.799
PROMISE TONIGHT I DO APPRECIATE

01:54:32.865 --> 01:54:36.202
THAT. THE TENSION THAT I HAVE

01:54:36.269 --> 01:54:38.004
BEEN IN A KNOWLEDGE IN THE

01:54:38.071 --> 01:54:39.172
IMPORTANCE OF DOING THAT

01:54:39.239 --> 01:54:41.307
ANALYSIS AND DOING THAT RIGHT IS

01:54:41.374 --> 01:54:42.875
THAT YOU KNOW AIR B. DID AN

01:54:42.942 --> 01:54:45.445
ANALYSIS OF ITS CAP AND TRADE

01:54:45.511 --> 01:54:47.180
PROGRAM WITH ALL OF THESE POST

01:54:47.247 --> 01:54:48.548
TWENTY TWENTY FEATURES AND IT

01:54:48.615 --> 01:54:49.983
SAID YOU WERE FINE IF THERE'S A

01:54:50.049 --> 01:54:50.883
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:52.118
ALLOWANCES BANKED. LOOKING AT

01:54:52.185 --> 01:54:54.053
EXACTLY THESE FEATURES AND I

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:59.192
MENTION THIS NOT NOT. TO GET

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:00.026
INTO AN ARGUMENT ABOUT ANY OF

01:55:00.093 --> 01:55:01.661
THIS BUT- WE THINGS ARE WORSE

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:02.662
THAN THAN WERE ANTICIPATED IN

01:55:02.729 --> 01:55:03.663
THAT ROLE MAKING IT'S NOT EVEN

01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:04.931
CLOSE IT'S LIKE TWICE THE LEVEL.

01:55:04.998 --> 01:55:08.001
THAT WAS ANTICIPATED- SO I GET A

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:09.302
LITTLE SENSITIVE WHEN PEOPLE

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:10.536
START SAYING ALL BUT THE PROGRAM

01:55:10.603 --> 01:55:11.838
IS DIFFERENT NOW WE KNOW WHAT

01:55:11.904 --> 01:55:12.805
THE PROGRAM HAS LOOKED LIKE

01:55:12.872 --> 01:55:14.040
SINCE MID TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND

01:55:14.107 --> 01:55:15.275
EVERY TRADER WHO PLACES A BET

01:55:15.341 --> 01:55:16.509
EVERY PERCH IN PERSON WHO

01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:18.411
PURCHASES THAT AUCTION. KNOWS

01:55:18.478 --> 01:55:19.679
EXACTLY WHAT THOSE RULES ARE

01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:20.380
THERE'S NOTHING NEW WE'RE

01:55:20.446 --> 01:55:22.415
LEARNING. SO THAT THE TENSION I

01:55:22.482 --> 01:55:24.550
WANT TO SERVICE HERE IS THAT. IF

01:55:24.617 --> 01:55:25.518
WE ARE GONNA HAVE AN HONEST

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:26.853
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS A LITTLE

01:55:26.919 --> 01:55:29.122
LATER. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE

01:55:29.188 --> 01:55:30.456
SORT OF TRUST WITH THE NUMBERS

01:55:30.523 --> 01:55:31.824
ARE GOING TO BE BECAUSE WE HAD A

01:55:31.891 --> 01:55:32.992
KNOCK DOWN DRAG OUT ABOUT THIS

01:55:33.059 --> 01:55:34.327
FOUR YEARS AGO. AND WE LOST YOU

01:55:34.394 --> 01:55:36.362
KNOW FOR FIVE YEARS OF CLIMATE

01:55:36.429 --> 01:55:37.230
PROGRESS WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO

01:55:37.297 --> 01:55:39.165
THAT AGAIN. AND I DON'T THINK

01:55:39.232 --> 01:55:40.500
ANYONE COULD SAY HERE'S THE

01:55:40.566 --> 01:55:41.934
PERFECT STRATEGY WITHOUT GOING

01:55:42.001 --> 01:55:43.569
THROUGH THE EXACT PROCESS THAT.

01:55:43.636 --> 01:55:44.971
I'VE HEARD THE CHAIRMAN THE

01:55:45.038 --> 01:55:47.740
SECRETARY ADVOCATE SO- THAT'S

01:55:47.807 --> 01:55:48.941
WHAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT AS

01:55:49.008 --> 01:55:50.310
WELL AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

01:55:50.376 --> 01:55:51.577
CONFLICTED ABOUT HIS ID. THERE

01:55:51.644 --> 01:55:53.513
ARE NO MAGIC LEVERS TO PULL WORK

01:55:53.579 --> 01:55:54.914
POLICY STRATEGIES TO JUST

01:55:54.981 --> 01:55:56.749
MAGICALLY IMPLEMENT. WE'VE GOT

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:58.084
TO HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION

01:55:58.151 --> 01:55:59.686
ABOUT ALL THE STUFF AND THEN

01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:00.286
WE'VE GOT TO BE ACCURATE ABOUT

01:56:00.353 --> 01:56:02.355
IT. AND THAT'S THE PART THAT'S

01:56:02.422 --> 01:56:03.556
BEEN MISSING AND I JUST

01:56:03.623 --> 01:56:05.591
INCLUDING WITH THE CHAIR. I MEAN

01:56:05.658 --> 01:56:06.859
IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE

01:56:06.926 --> 01:56:07.827
AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:56:07.894 --> 01:56:10.063
THIS AND THAT'S NOT A COMMENT ON

01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:11.197
YOUR CURRENT LEADERSHIP BUT IT'S

01:56:11.264 --> 01:56:12.699
A HISTORICAL PROBLEM THAT

01:56:12.765 --> 01:56:13.499
TECHNICAL EXPERTS HAVE BEEN

01:56:13.566 --> 01:56:14.801
DEALING WITH. THIS AND I'M JUST

01:56:14.867 --> 01:56:16.636
BEGGING. FOR GOING TO WAIT CAN

01:56:16.703 --> 01:56:21.574
WE. PLEASE SPEAK OPENLY. YEAH

01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:22.342
THERE ARE SOME. THERE'S

01:56:22.408 --> 01:56:23.776
CERTAINLY BEEN HAS BEEN. A CARB

01:56:23.843 --> 01:56:26.346

CARBON HE PROTESTED BECAUSE HE

01:56:51.003 --> 01:56:52.038
THOUGHT IT WAS FUNDAMENTALLY

01:56:52.105 --> 01:56:55.108
FLAWED. I KNOW THAT IT WHEN KERR

01:56:55.174 --> 01:56:58.845

01:57:06.986 --> 01:57:08.087
THERE'S NO QUESTION OF ITS

01:57:08.154 --> 01:57:10.456
LEGITIMACY I KNOW THE SENATE HAS

01:57:10.523 --> 01:57:12.291
RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE CAP

01:57:12.358 --> 01:57:14.127

THE SAME THINGS LIKE NOT OVER

02:03:45.718 --> 02:03:51.423

PLANS ARE- AND WHETHER OR NOT-

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:07.339
LINKAGES IN THE PROGRAMS ARE.

02:04:07.406 --> 02:04:08.908
POSSIBLE- BUT AS- YOU KNOW I

02:04:08.974 --> 02:04:10.843
JUST GO BY TO THE LEVEL POINT-

02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:13.145
THAT WE ARE ALWAYS OPEN TO

02:04:13.212 --> 02:04:14.647

FOCUSED ON- AT. A CLEAR CLEAR

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:24.790
EVIDENCE CLEAR ANALYSIS AND A

02:04:24.857 --> 02:04:26.292
ROBUST PUBLIC DISCUSSION WHERE

02:04:26.358 --> 02:04:28.627
ALL POINTS OF VIEW- CAN HAVE THE

02:04:28.694 --> 02:04:31.030
OPPORTUNITY TO BE PRESENTED AND

02:04:31.096 --> 02:04:35.167
CONSIDERED. I WOULD BE A LEO

02:04:35.234 --> 02:04:36.502
DON'T YOU THINK I MEAN WE HAVE

02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:38.537
WE SET UP THIS PROGRAM YOU WERE.

02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:41.307
YOU AROUND THE OLD DAYS- THAT WE

02:04:41.373 --> 02:04:42.408
HAVE THIS PER PROGRAM WE WANTED

02:04:42.474 --> 02:04:44.643
TO INVITE OTHER ENTITIES OTHER

02:04:44.710 --> 02:04:46.779
STATES TO DO YOU DO THIS FREE

02:04:46.846 --> 02:04:50.816
FLOW. OF TREATING AND REDUCTIONS

02:04:50.883 --> 02:04:51.817
SO WE WOULD REDUCE ACTUAL

02:04:51.884 --> 02:04:53.419
MISSION ARE WE MISSING AN

02:04:53.485 --> 02:04:55.187
OPPORTUNITY WITH THE STATE OF

02:04:55.254 --> 02:04:59.358
WASHINGTON ON NOT- NOT PREPARED.

02:04:59.425 --> 02:05:02.528
TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT IN AN

02:05:02.595 --> 02:05:06.198
EXPEDITED WAY- MISTER CHAIRMAN I

02:05:06.265 --> 02:05:09.668
THINK UNFORTUNATELY I. AM NOT.

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:10.803
TOO FAMILIAR WITH KIND OF THE

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:12.638
DESIGN OF THE WASHINGTON PROGRAM

02:05:12.705 --> 02:05:13.939
KIND OF EXACTLY ALL THE

02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:15.174
DIFFERENT FEATURES THAT I KNOW

02:05:15.241 --> 02:05:17.243
SOME OF THE I DID NOT REPORT-

02:05:17.309 --> 02:05:18.344
KIND MENTIONS SOME OF THAT

02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:19.745
OFFSETS FEATURES AND- YOU

02:05:19.812 --> 02:05:21.914
MENTION IN YOUR- YOUR COMMENTS

02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:24.416
JUST NOW AS WELL- I MEAN I THINK

02:05:24.483 --> 02:05:27.152
THERE'S A LOT OF- COMPLICATED-

02:05:27.219 --> 02:05:28.988
SET OF ISSUES AROUND SHE KIND OF

02:05:29.054 --> 02:05:30.789
LINKING TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

02:05:30.856 --> 02:05:32.725
AND DETERMINING SORT OF OUT OF

02:05:32.791 --> 02:05:34.793
THERE THE PROGRAMS ARE KIND OF

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:35.561
DIFFICULT WHEN TECHNICALLY

02:05:35.628 --> 02:05:38.664
STRINGENT- SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:39.765
CHALLENGES TO THAT BUT THERE IS

02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:41.500
ALSO A KIND OF A LOT OF MERIT I

02:05:41.567 --> 02:05:43.102
THINK TO KIND OF EXPLORING THOSE

02:05:43.168 --> 02:05:45.404
ISSUES JUST FROM A- KIND OF-

02:05:45.471 --> 02:05:46.839
DEMONSTRATION PERSPECTIVE AS

02:05:46.906 --> 02:05:50.175
WELL AS- YOU KNOW POTENTIAL FOR.

02:05:50.242 --> 02:05:52.411
JUST LOWER OVERALL COSTS- ACROSS

02:05:52.478 --> 02:05:53.879
KIND OF ALL JURISDICTIONS AND

02:05:53.946 --> 02:05:55.748
KIND OF REDUCING EMISSIONS SO OF

02:05:55.814 --> 02:05:57.816
COURSE I GUESS I'M NOT ABLE TO

02:05:57.883 --> 02:05:59.184
COMMENT TOO MUCH ON THE

02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:00.052
SPECIFICS OF THE WASHINGTON

02:06:00.119 --> 02:06:01.720
PROGRAM AND- AND YOU KNOW HOW IT

02:06:01.787 --> 02:06:03.122
KIND OF LIKES TO CALIFORNIA AND

02:06:03.188 --> 02:06:04.156
KIND OF THE PROCESS FOR THAT

02:06:04.223 --> 02:06:06.458
EXACTLY BUT- YOU KNOW IT'S

02:06:06.525 --> 02:06:08.627
DEFINITELY KIND OF WORTH- WORTH

02:06:08.694 --> 02:06:10.262
EXPLORING I THINK IT'S JUST A-

02:06:10.329 --> 02:06:11.597
TO KNOW WHAT I MEAN. AT LEAST

02:06:11.664 --> 02:06:13.666
BASED ON MY FAMILIARITY WITH THE

02:06:13.732 --> 02:06:14.767
PROCESS OF THEIRS. IT CAN BE

02:06:14.833 --> 02:06:16.402
VERY COMPLICATED AND A LOT OF

02:06:16.468 --> 02:06:17.503
IMPORTANT KIND OF CONSIDERATIONS

02:06:17.569 --> 02:06:19.405
GO INTO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE

02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:20.940
PROGRAMS ARE EQUIVALENT BEFORE

02:06:21.006 --> 02:06:22.741
THEY KIND OF CONNECT WITH ONE

02:06:22.808 --> 02:06:28.714
ANOTHER. DR BURCHELL. THANK YOU

02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:29.715
. I REALLY AGREE WITH WHAT SHE

02:06:29.782 --> 02:06:31.483
SAID AND I DO ALL OF. I THINK

02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:33.319
I'M- OF JUST A COUPLE. THE

02:06:33.385 --> 02:06:34.887
LOOKING. SINCE I KNOW THEY ARE

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:35.921
WENT THROUGH FOR YOU. AND

02:06:35.988 --> 02:06:37.656
WORKING OUT NEGOTIATIONS WITH

02:06:37.723 --> 02:06:39.291
QUEBEC AND- IT WAS APPROACHED TO

02:06:39.358 --> 02:06:42.561
DO THAT THE WAY IT WAS DONE AND-

02:06:42.628 --> 02:06:45.464
I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT- HOWEVER.

02:06:45.531 --> 02:06:49.868
I THINK. WE NEED TO. RECOGNIZE I

02:06:49.935 --> 02:06:51.637
THINK YOU WANT TO RECOGNIZE

02:06:51.704 --> 02:06:53.605
CALIFORNIA STANDS OUT ON A

02:06:53.672 --> 02:06:57.376
GLOBAL STAGE I DO A LOT OF WORK

02:06:57.443 --> 02:06:59.411
IN EUROPE I'VE DONE SOME WORK IN

02:06:59.478 --> 02:07:02.047
ASIA AND I AM. AMAZED AT THE

02:07:02.114 --> 02:07:04.216
ATTENTION OUT SO DO YOU KNOW

02:07:04.283 --> 02:07:05.150
CALIFORNIA IS WITH A HUGE

02:07:05.217 --> 02:07:07.286
ECONOMY WHAT SHIFT SIX LARGEST

02:07:07.353 --> 02:07:08.687
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD ANYWAY BUT

02:07:08.754 --> 02:07:09.955
THE ATTENTION THE CALIFORNIA

02:07:10.022 --> 02:07:11.457
DECISIONS ON THIS THIS POLICY

02:07:11.523 --> 02:07:13.392
DIRECTION BACK IN THE ORDER OF

02:07:13.459 --> 02:07:15.160
ATTENTION THAT A LOT OF OTHER

02:07:15.227 --> 02:07:17.162
JURISDICTIONS TAKE COURAGE FROM

02:07:17.229 --> 02:07:17.930
DECISIONS THE CALIFORNIA MAKES

02:07:17.997 --> 02:07:21.834
US. I THINK US SENATOR DOLLY

02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:23.535
SAID EARLIER EARLIER THAT YEAH

02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:25.604
WE'RE 1% GLOBAL AMBITIONS BUT WE

02:07:25.671 --> 02:07:26.972
HAVE GREATER THAN THAT INFLUENCE

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:28.340
IN CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO

02:07:28.407 --> 02:07:35.614
CARBON PRICING AS PART OF A TOLL. ROAD HARBOR. PERFORMANCE LED

02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:37.583
TO SITUATION GLOBE WORK. WERE

02:07:37.649 --> 02:07:38.417
ROUGHLY TWO FIVE PER OF. AND ARE

02:07:38.484 --> 02:07:40.386
NOW CO BY SO TYPE OF CARBON. AND

02:07:40.452 --> 02:07:41.787
YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED THAT A

02:07:41.854 --> 02:07:43.155
GREAT PORTION OF THOSE ARE OUT

02:07:43.222 --> 02:07:44.590
OF CARBON PRICE OR HIGHER THAN

02:07:44.656 --> 02:07:45.157
THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE

02:07:45.224 --> 02:07:47.326
OBSERVE IN CALIFORNIA. IT WE

02:07:47.393 --> 02:07:48.927
DISCUSSED EARLIER THE BARRIERS

02:07:48.994 --> 02:07:50.262
TO EXPANDING CARBON PRICING IN

02:07:50.329 --> 02:07:52.364
CALIFORNIA THERE. IT'S VERY

02:07:52.431 --> 02:07:53.866
CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF LEAKAGE

02:07:53.932 --> 02:07:55.000
BUT LINKING WITH OTHER

02:07:55.067 --> 02:07:57.069
JURISDICTIONS IS THAT IS THE KEY

02:07:57.136 --> 02:07:59.071
PIECE TO ADDRESSING THAT LEACH

02:07:59.138 --> 02:08:00.973
LEAKAGE CHALLENGE LINKING

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:03.375
ADDRESSES LEAKAGE. BECAUSE IT

02:08:03.442 --> 02:08:05.177
BRINGS IN TRUCKS WERE CALLED

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:07.246
MARKET ALIGNING CLASS OF CLIMATE

02:08:07.312 --> 02:08:09.481
POLICY STRINGENCY. POSSIBLY LEAK

02:08:09.548 --> 02:08:10.649
FORMAL LINKING WITH MARKETS

02:08:10.716 --> 02:08:12.518
OTHERWISE ALIGNING CLIMATE

02:08:12.584 --> 02:08:13.585
POLICY GOALS AS WE CAN WITH

02:08:13.652 --> 02:08:15.587
ORDER BENEFITS STOPPED. BY WITH

02:08:15.654 --> 02:08:17.523
THAT WITHIN A- SPECIFIC TRADING

02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:19.591
MARKET. THIS IS PROLIFERATING

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:21.660
ACROSS WESTERN STATES WAS MORE

02:08:21.727 --> 02:08:24.663
MORE INTEREST IN THIS SO I WOULD

02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:26.065
THINK THAT IT'S IN CALIFORNIA'S

02:08:26.131 --> 02:08:28.000
INTEREST I THINK IT. I THINK

02:08:28.067 --> 02:08:28.700
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT OUR

02:08:28.767 --> 02:08:31.370
DOCTOR SHOULD DISCUSS IN TWENTY

02:08:31.437 --> 02:08:33.539
TWENTY TWO DOES. THE OBSTACLES

02:08:33.605 --> 02:08:35.007
AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR LINKING

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:36.508
WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS

02:08:36.575 --> 02:08:37.276
ALIGNING WITH OTHER

02:08:37.342 --> 02:08:38.911
JURISDICTIONS. IN ORDER TO GET A

02:08:38.977 --> 02:08:40.345
GRIP GROWING SENSE OF MOMENTUM

02:08:40.412 --> 02:08:41.680
ACROSS ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE

02:08:41.747 --> 02:08:43.182
WESTERN POWER GRID BUT IN

02:08:43.248 --> 02:08:45.217
GENERAL ACROSS THE WHOLE NATION

02:08:45.284 --> 02:08:47.753
OF A CLIMATE MOVEMENT THAT CAN

WITH THE PROCEEDS. I HAVE A

02:11:46.965 --> 02:11:49.201
QUESTION ON THE FORCE OFFSETS IN

PARTICULAR THE I. MAC REPORTS

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.107

02:11:55.173 --> 02:11:58.210
TALKING ABOUT I'VE SPOTS I. DID

02:11:58.277 --> 02:11:59.911
OUR PANEL WITH THEIR- WE'RE ALL

02:11:59.978 --> 02:12:01.179
FAMILIAR THE LA WATER FROM SEPT

TO FIRST TALKED ABOUT BPF ENERGY

02:12:04.783 --> 02:12:06.518
BUYING ANY RANCH IN MENDOCINO

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:08.754
COUNTY AND CARBON CREDITS WERE

02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:10.722
OFFSET BY THEIR ADMISSIONS AT

02:12:10.789 --> 02:12:13.625
THE OIL REFINERY- WE ALL KNOW

02:12:13.692 --> 02:12:15.160
THAT IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY

02:12:15.227 --> 02:12:17.229
EIGHTEEN. THE GETTY RANCH

02:12:17.296 --> 02:12:19.698
BASICALLY BURNED DOWN IN NEARLY

02:12:19.765 --> 02:12:21.800
ALL THE PLANNED CARBON CREDITS

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:24.102
WERE RENDERED USELESS HOWEVER

02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:26.505
MONTHS LATER. TO YOUR BOARD

02:12:26.571 --> 02:12:28.273
ALLOWED THE OPERATION TO SELL

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:30.375
THOSE CREDITS TO POLLUTERS BASED

02:12:30.442 --> 02:12:32.844
ON THE DECISION THAT THE STATE

02:12:32.911 --> 02:12:34.980
OF THE RANCH BEFORE THE FIRE.

02:12:35.047 --> 02:12:36.615
EVERYTHING MIGHT HAPPEN AT AT

02:12:36.682 --> 02:12:38.183
EIGHTIES RANCH WAS PERMITTED

SALE OF THE ASSETS ON THE LAND

02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:43.255
SO THE QUESTION COMES IN WHEN

02:12:43.322 --> 02:12:44.790
WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THESE

02:12:44.856 --> 02:12:46.558
PROGRAMS ALTHOUGH THE

02:12:46.625 --> 02:12:50.362
TRANSACTION WAS LEGAL DO YOU

02:12:50.429 --> 02:12:51.330
THINK IT WAS WRONG. SECRETARY

AGREED TO BY. OKAY I WILL I'LL

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:09.114
TAKE THIS- THIS ONE INDEED- YOU

KNOW THE PROCESS FOR HAVING A

02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:13.785
APPROVING AN OFFSET PROTOCOL IS

02:13:13.852 --> 02:13:16.621
VERY COMPLEX TAKES A SIGNIFICANT

02:13:16.688 --> 02:13:21.026
AMOUNT OF TIME AND INCLUDES- AS

02:13:21.093 --> 02:13:23.028
I DISCUSSED IN MY PRESENTATION

02:13:23.095 --> 02:13:27.532
IT INCLUDES- THE ADDITIONAL-

02:13:27.599 --> 02:13:29.000
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BUFFER

02:13:29.067 --> 02:13:34.272
POOL- AND SO YOU KNOW WE THE

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:37.476
QUESTION OF- HOW PARTICULAR OR

02:13:37.542 --> 02:13:39.277
ISSUES RELATED TO PARTICULAR

02:13:39.344 --> 02:13:43.382
PROTOCOL APPROVALS- AND- AND HOW

02:13:43.448 --> 02:13:46.418
THAT- HOW THOSE PLAY OUT. ARE

02:13:46.485 --> 02:13:47.619
ALL SORT OF PART OF THESE

02:13:47.686 --> 02:13:51.923
TECHNICAL- CONSIDERATIONS IN THE

02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:54.292
IN THE OFFSET PROGRAM AND AS I

02:13:54.359 --> 02:13:56.061
MENTIONED IN MY PRESENTATION I

02:13:56.128 --> 02:13:59.297
HAVE ASKED STAFF TO- TAKE A LOOK

02:13:59.364 --> 02:14:01.867
AT SETTING UP A PUBLIC WORKSHOP-

02:14:01.933 --> 02:14:04.269
AND DIVING INTO SOME OF THESE

02:14:04.336 --> 02:14:07.773
DESIGN ELEMENTS WITH REGARD TO-

02:14:07.839 --> 02:14:10.509
TO THE OFFSET PROTOCOLS- AND I

02:14:10.575 --> 02:14:11.576
WILL SAY YOU KNOW THERE ARE

02:14:11.643 --> 02:14:17.015
CERTAIN- AREAS WHERE- REASONABLE

02:14:17.082 --> 02:14:19.017
PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT THE SAME

02:14:19.084 --> 02:14:21.653
INFORMATION AND DISAGREE- AND

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:24.923
DRAW. DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS- IN

02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:28.326
TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE

02:14:28.393 --> 02:14:30.061
OF THE PROTOCOL APPROVAL

02:14:30.128 --> 02:14:33.832
PROCESS- AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE

02:14:33.899 --> 02:14:35.100
THERE WAS ROBUST DEBATE AT THE

02:14:35.167 --> 02:14:39.571
TIME- THAT- FORESTRY PROTOCOLS

02:14:39.638 --> 02:14:41.606
WERE APPROVED ABOUT HOW TO

02:14:41.673 --> 02:14:44.376
CONSIDER THINGS- SUCH AS

02:14:44.443 --> 02:14:47.779
ADDITIONALITY AND PERMANENCE AND

02:14:47.846 --> 02:14:50.949
OTHER ISSUES- WE CAN CERTAINLY

02:14:51.016 --> 02:14:52.584
HAVE A OF A PUBLIC DISCUSSION

02:14:52.651 --> 02:14:54.152
ABOUT WHETHER WE NEED TO REVISIT

02:14:54.219 --> 02:14:56.988
ANY OF THOSE- FACTORS AND I

02:14:57.055 --> 02:14:58.723
THINK THAT WILL BE PART OF THE

02:14:58.790 --> 02:15:01.026
DISCUSSION- IN THE END THE

02:15:01.092 --> 02:15:02.794
WORKSHOP PROCESS THAT WE ARE

02:15:02.861 --> 02:15:07.899
PLANNING TO KICK OFF LATER. THIS

02:15:07.966 --> 02:15:09.868
YEAR- BUT AT YOU KNOW AT. I

02:15:09.935 --> 02:15:13.205
THINK WE NEED TO- BE OPEN TO

02:15:13.271 --> 02:15:14.606
HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT WE

02:15:14.673 --> 02:15:16.308
ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:15:16.374 --> 02:15:17.375
THERE MAY BE A POINT AT WHICH WE

02:15:17.442 --> 02:15:19.578
DISAGREE- AND IT DOESN'T MEAN

02:15:19.644 --> 02:15:21.947
THAT WE ARE BEING. DISHONEST IT

02:15:22.013 --> 02:15:23.982
MEANS THAT WE ARE SIMPLY.

02:15:24.049 --> 02:15:25.283
LOOKING AT THE SAME DATA AND

02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:26.885
DISAGREEING WITH THE POLICY

02:15:26.952 --> 02:15:28.820
APPROACHES THAT ARE CHOSEN I

02:15:28.887 --> 02:15:30.355
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TRANSACTION

02:15:30.422 --> 02:15:31.790
WAS LEGAL YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:15:31.857 --> 02:15:33.391
PLENTY OF LAWYERS ON THE SCREEN

02:15:33.458 --> 02:15:35.126
HERE IN IN THE AUDIENCE THERE

02:15:35.193 --> 02:15:38.363
I'M JUST IT'S THAT THE IDEA THAT

02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:40.866
THIS TYPE OF. TRANSACTION NEEDS

02:15:40.932 --> 02:15:42.267
TO BE ADDRESSED SO THAT IT

02:15:42.334 --> 02:15:44.135
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN NO IT'S

02:15:44.202 --> 02:15:46.071
NICE TO TALK ABOUT THE PROTOCOLS

02:15:46.137 --> 02:15:48.173
IT'S NICE TALK ABOUT PRICES BUT-

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:50.208
YOU KNOW I'VE- BEEN TO. SOME

02:15:50.275 --> 02:15:51.710
PEOPLE NOTED TO SOMETIMES I GET

02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:53.678

CREDITS FOR BIRD TELL FORESTS.

02:15:58.116 --> 02:16:00.218
IN THE END THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY

02:16:00.285 --> 02:16:01.520
READ OVERALL REDUCE OUR

02:16:01.586 --> 02:16:03.555
GREENHOUSE GASES SOMETHING'S GOT

02:16:03.622 --> 02:16:06.091
TO CHANGE SO I HOPE THAT. THE

02:16:06.157 --> 02:16:08.093
MESSAGES IS GET THAT AT LEAST

02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:09.761
THIS LEGISLATOR WOULD LIKE TO

02:16:09.828 --> 02:16:11.763
SEE WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS IT'S

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:14.299
WITH AN EYE TOWARDS THIS. IF

02:16:14.366 --> 02:16:17.168
THIS ENDS NOW THAT'S NOT WHAT

02:16:17.235 --> 02:16:19.538

ANTICIPATE- ADDRESSING THOSE-

02:17:42.787 --> 02:17:43.955
AFTER THE SPENDING PLAN IS

02:17:44.022 --> 02:17:45.924
COMPLETED AS PART OF THE FREE

02:17:45.991 --> 02:17:47.692
WORLD MAKING WORKSHOP AS PART

02:17:47.759 --> 02:17:50.495
OF- AN ADDITIONAL REPORT TO THE

02:17:50.562 --> 02:17:52.330
LEGISLATURE SUGGESTED BY

02:17:52.397 --> 02:17:54.733

PART OF THAT- YOU KNOW DETAIL

02:17:57.435 --> 02:18:00.305
THE PUBLIC PROCESS- THAT WILL

02:18:00.372 --> 02:18:02.407
DIVE INTO. SOME OF THESE

02:18:02.474 --> 02:18:04.643
IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTIONS THAT

02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:07.612
ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL- AND WOULD

02:18:07.679 --> 02:18:13.885
BENEFIT FROM- SOME. YEAH OF DATA

02:18:13.952 --> 02:18:16.254
THAT- AT IN TERMS OF HOW THE

02:18:16.321 --> 02:18:24.095
PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY PERFORMING. SO FOR INSTANCE ON THIS

02:18:24.162 --> 02:18:26.131
ASSESSMENTS THAT CARBS SHOULD

02:18:26.197 --> 02:18:28.566
REVISIT THE DATA AND ASSUMPTIONS

02:18:28.633 --> 02:18:30.602
THAT YOU SIGNED ON FOR

02:18:30.669 --> 02:18:34.472
ALLOCATIONS YOU WOULD SCHEDULE

02:18:34.539 --> 02:18:36.307
PART OF THE HEARING TO LOOK AT

02:18:36.374 --> 02:18:37.909
THE I MAC REPORT ON THE FREE

02:18:37.976 --> 02:18:40.211
ALLOCATIONS AND WHAT THAT

02:18:40.278 --> 02:18:42.147
REGULATORY DESIGN. OR IF THE

02:18:42.213 --> 02:18:45.650
ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU MAKE. IS IT

02:18:45.717 --> 02:18:47.218
USEFUL AS IT'S STILL LEGITIMATE

02:18:47.285 --> 02:18:49.854
THAT WHEN YOU HIT THAT YOU'RE

02:18:49.921 --> 02:18:52.424
CURRENTLY USING. WELL YOU KNOW

02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:54.526
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE I THINK

02:18:54.592 --> 02:18:57.195
THE- THE PRE REGULATORY WORKSHOP

02:18:57.262 --> 02:18:58.797
PROCESS CAN BE REALLY USEFUL

02:18:58.863 --> 02:19:01.132
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN SET UP A

02:19:01.199 --> 02:19:03.835
CONVERSATION THAT HIGHLIGHTS YOU

02:19:03.902 --> 02:19:05.637
KNOW SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

02:19:05.704 --> 02:19:07.439
SPECIFIC ISSUES IN THE REPORT.

02:19:07.505 --> 02:19:11.509
AND SET UP PANELS OR OR OR OTHER

02:19:11.576 --> 02:19:14.446
MEANS TEN TO DIVE INTO. THE

02:19:14.512 --> 02:19:16.247
PROPOSALS AND HEAR THE PROS AND

02:19:16.314 --> 02:19:18.316
CONS FROM VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS-

02:19:18.383 --> 02:19:21.953
ABOUT HOW- WE SHOULD ADDRESS

02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:22.821
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. DR

02:19:22.887 --> 02:19:28.126
BERTRAM. THE GENERAL THANK

02:19:28.193 --> 02:19:29.994
YOU'RE GENERALLY I THINK THE

02:19:30.061 --> 02:19:31.830
FIRST THING THAT WILL BE LOOKING

02:19:31.896 --> 02:19:34.566
FOR IS THE- THE AND A

02:19:34.632 --> 02:19:36.301
CONSTIPATED INCLUSION ON THE

02:19:36.367 --> 02:19:37.869
SCOPING PLAN PROCESS OF SOME OF

02:19:37.936 --> 02:19:39.738
THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HELP WITH

02:19:39.804 --> 02:19:41.473
WITH RESPECT TO THE ROLE OF THE

02:19:41.539 --> 02:19:43.775
CARBON MARKET COMPLEX- I THINK

02:19:43.842 --> 02:19:45.744
THAT- SURE RANDALL SENSOR

02:19:45.810 --> 02:19:48.113
PREVIOUSLY WAS SPOT ON THAT-

02:19:48.179 --> 02:19:49.781
IT'S THE WORKSHOP PROCESS THAT

02:19:49.848 --> 02:19:51.716
CAN REALLY HELP FROM THESE IDEAS

02:19:51.783 --> 02:19:53.651
COME TO LOOK FOR SOME OF THESE

02:19:53.718 --> 02:19:55.120
IDEAS HAVE TO BE WORKSHOP. ARE

02:19:55.186 --> 02:19:57.188
THEY THEY ARE NECESSARILY OUT OF

02:19:57.255 --> 02:19:59.390
THE BOX THE RIGHT WAY TO GO-

02:19:59.457 --> 02:20:01.626
BUT- THE I THINK THAT THERE'S A

02:20:01.693 --> 02:20:04.028
LOT OF CONTRIBUTION TO BEAR ARMS

02:20:04.095 --> 02:20:06.397
I THINK THAT- ONE SUGGESTION

02:20:06.464 --> 02:20:11.870
THAT WE HAD THAT WE- THE ON

02:20:11.936 --> 02:20:15.240
GOING- IDEA OF REGULAR

02:20:15.306 --> 02:20:16.808
MONITORING OF THE PROGRAMME IN

02:20:16.875 --> 02:20:17.942
APPROVAL OF THE PROGRAM OVER

02:20:18.009 --> 02:20:19.310
TIME IS REAL TIGHT BUT BETTER

02:20:19.377 --> 02:20:22.747
REAL TIME METRICS ALL THE- SIZE

02:20:22.814 --> 02:20:23.681
OF THE LAWN SPANKING ALONE

02:20:23.748 --> 02:20:25.617
HOLDINGS TRANSACTIONS THE

02:20:25.683 --> 02:20:27.819
PRODUCTS CAN BE ACCOMMODATED

02:20:27.886 --> 02:20:29.220
UNDER PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS FOR

02:20:29.287 --> 02:20:31.456
THE COMPLIANCE ENTITIES. MARKET

02:20:31.523 --> 02:20:33.925
PARTICIPANTS SO THAT MIGHT FALL

02:20:33.992 --> 02:20:35.126
IN THE REALM OF A REGULATORY

02:20:35.193 --> 02:20:36.561
RULEMAKING SO MAYBE IT'S NOT

02:20:36.628 --> 02:20:38.329
PART OF THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS

02:20:38.396 --> 02:20:40.565
BUT IT CAN BE PART OF THE OF THE

02:20:40.632 --> 02:20:43.601
WORKSHOP AND SPECIFICALLY I'M IT

02:20:43.668 --> 02:20:44.636
IS PART OF THE SCREEN PLAN

02:20:44.702 --> 02:20:46.771
PROCESS I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO

02:20:46.838 --> 02:20:51.509
SEE OR SOME ALTERNATIVE.

02:20:51.576 --> 02:20:52.844
SCENARIOS THAT. THE A GRAY OR-

02:20:52.911 --> 02:20:55.146
ROLE. OTHER CAR MARKET LET'S TRY

02:20:55.213 --> 02:20:59.450
A I MEAN I AM A MODELER AND I

02:20:59.517 --> 02:21:01.586
HAVE. I'M IMPRESSED DEEPLY

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:03.354
IMPRESSED BY THE AMBITION OF THE

02:21:03.421 --> 02:21:04.556
SCOPING BOMB PROCESS FROM THE

02:21:04.622 --> 02:21:06.224
FIRST WHISTLE THAT'S TAKEN AS

02:21:06.291 --> 02:21:08.960
PART OF THAT- SO I DON'T WANT TO

02:21:09.027 --> 02:21:10.662
OVER ELSE CAN TERMS OF THE

02:21:10.728 --> 02:21:12.997
DETAIL WHEN FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED

02:21:13.064 --> 02:21:16.301
CERTAIN. DECADE IN ANY CASE BUT

02:21:16.367 --> 02:21:17.635
I DO THINK THAT THE PROCESS

02:21:17.702 --> 02:21:19.270
SHOULD LOOK AT SCENARIOS WHICH

02:21:19.337 --> 02:21:21.039
HAVE A GREATER OR LESSER ROLE

02:21:21.105 --> 02:21:21.973
FOR THE CORPORATE MARKET AND

02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:22.774
THAT COULD BE RERESENTED

02:21:22.841 --> 02:21:24.309
THROUGH A GREATER OR LESSER.

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:30.014
CARBON PRICE OR- OR- AND I WOULD

02:21:30.081 --> 02:21:31.883
SPECIFICALLY LIKE TO SEE IF THE

02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:32.417
MARKET DYNAMICS COULD BE

02:21:32.483 --> 02:21:34.385
REPRESENTED THROUGH ALTERNATIVE

02:21:34.452 --> 02:21:36.187
SUPPLY ADJUSTMENT APPROACHES

02:21:36.254 --> 02:21:38.056
FULL SUCH AS CHANGING THE PRICE

02:21:38.122 --> 02:21:40.425
FOR OR PRECIOUS MUSCLE ALONE.

02:21:40.491 --> 02:21:42.327
LIVE BY ADDING ON AN ADDITIONAL

02:21:42.393 --> 02:21:44.062
PRICE STUFF THINGS LIKE THAT

02:21:44.128 --> 02:21:47.665
THAT COULD INFORM OF THE OF THE

02:21:47.732 --> 02:21:49.100
REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT AND

02:21:49.167 --> 02:21:50.668
TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I READ YOUR

02:21:50.735 --> 02:21:52.904
QUOTE IN THE AP ARTICLE LAST

02:21:52.971 --> 02:21:55.874
WEEK ABOUT- THE SIZE OF THE A

02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:57.909
LOT OF THE OF THE BANK OF THE

02:21:57.976 --> 02:22:00.211
ALLOWANCE IN YOUR ID CODE SAYING

02:22:00.278 --> 02:22:02.013
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ALL THE

02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:04.115
COVERED SOURCES. DON'T REDUCE

02:22:04.182 --> 02:22:05.683
EMISSIONS AT ALL IN THE COURSE

02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:07.552
OF THE DECADE COULD YOU EXPAND

02:22:07.619 --> 02:22:09.721
ON THAT IS IT HE SAID. I MEAN

02:22:09.787 --> 02:22:11.890
THAT'S A REAL CONCERN THAT THERE

02:22:11.956 --> 02:22:14.392
ARE SO MANY ALLOWANCES AFTER.

02:22:14.459 --> 02:22:16.494
THAT ALL THE POLLUTERS JUST SIT

02:22:16.561 --> 02:22:18.596
HERE FOR THE NEXT EIGHT. EIGHT

02:22:18.663 --> 02:22:20.431
YEARS AND JUST SEND THEM THE

02:22:20.498 --> 02:22:22.367
ALLOWANCES AND DO NOTHING. HELLO

02:22:22.433 --> 02:22:23.635
GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS WE

02:22:23.701 --> 02:22:29.607
GET TO IT. TWENTY THIRTY BUT-

02:22:29.674 --> 02:22:30.842
EXPAND ON THAT. WELL THAT'S

02:22:30.909 --> 02:22:32.143
EXACTLY I WAS GOING UP FROM THE

02:22:32.210 --> 02:22:33.645
TRUSTEE THE THEY'RE IN THE BANK

02:22:33.711 --> 02:22:35.380
FULL FLEDGED. BUT IT DOES. ADD

02:22:35.446 --> 02:22:39.050
UP TO THE- A- I JUST REQUIRE

02:22:39.117 --> 02:22:40.818
ISN'T QUITE THE RIGHT WORD BUT

02:22:40.885 --> 02:22:43.288
THE- EXPECTED EMISSION

02:22:43.354 --> 02:22:45.456
REDUCTIONS FROM COVERED SOURCES

02:22:45.523 --> 02:22:46.557
SOURCES ARE COVERED BY THE

02:22:46.624 --> 02:22:48.259
CORPORATE MARKET WHICH ARE 75%

02:22:48.326 --> 02:22:50.161
OF SOURCES IN THE STATE THAT

02:22:50.228 --> 02:22:51.195
THEY COULD AT LEAST APPLY AT

02:22:51.262 --> 02:22:52.830
LEAST WITH RESPECT TO THE- THE-

02:22:52.897 --> 02:22:54.132
OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

02:22:54.198 --> 02:22:55.466
COVER MARKET THEY DON'T HAVE.

02:22:55.533 --> 02:22:56.501
THAT MEANT THEY COULD GET AWAY

02:22:56.567 --> 02:22:58.269
WITH DOING NOTHING I'M NOT

02:22:58.336 --> 02:22:59.237
SUGGESTING THAT WILL HAPPEN

02:22:59.304 --> 02:23:00.571
THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT

02:23:00.638 --> 02:23:01.906
DECISION POINT AND YOU'VE JUST

02:23:01.973 --> 02:23:03.942
MENTIONED IT WITH BY MEASURING

02:23:04.008 --> 02:23:04.842
TWENTY THIRTY I THINK ONE OF THE

02:23:04.909 --> 02:23:06.044
KEY QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD PUT

02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:08.079
ON THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA. AS

02:23:08.146 --> 02:23:10.181
THE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IS WHAT

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:11.883
HAPPENS POST TWENTY THIRTY AND

02:23:11.950 --> 02:23:13.584
YOU ASKED A COUPLE QUESTIONS WE

02:23:13.651 --> 02:23:15.787
GO WELL WHAT KINDS OF REFORMS

02:23:15.853 --> 02:23:18.589
MIGHT. HAPPEN THE REALLY HELP

02:23:18.656 --> 02:23:21.259
PROVIDE GREATER ASSURED US THAT

02:23:21.326 --> 02:23:22.827
THE STATE WILL ACHIEVE ITS GOALS

02:23:22.894 --> 02:23:24.429
AND SENATOR STERN ALSO RAISES

02:23:24.495 --> 02:23:26.397
QUESTIONS I THINK THERE THAT WAS

02:23:26.464 --> 02:23:28.833
THE NEXT BIG QUESTION BEFORE THE

02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:34.405
LEGISLATURE MR MAP. OUT A CARBON

02:23:34.472 --> 02:23:36.407
. OUCH SHE TRUE NET ZERO YEAH

02:23:36.474 --> 02:23:38.309
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT DOWN

02:23:38.376 --> 02:23:39.944
WOULD BE A WITH BANKING ALLOWED

02:23:40.011 --> 02:23:41.713
OR WHATEVER ONE COULD SEE THESE

02:23:41.779 --> 02:23:44.282
OTHER CUMULATIVE. ABOUT NUMBER

02:23:44.349 --> 02:23:46.017
OF TONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE.

02:23:46.084 --> 02:23:48.119
THE REMAINDER COME FROM A SOURCE

02:23:48.186 --> 02:23:50.922
IN CALIFORNIA OVER A TWENTY YEAR

02:23:50.989 --> 02:23:52.757
HORIZON OR WHATEVER YOU SHOULD

02:23:52.824 --> 02:23:55.093
NOT ZERO BEING. ACHIEVED AND

02:23:55.159 --> 02:23:57.195
THAT WILL INVOLVE GOING THROUGH

02:23:57.261 --> 02:24:00.198
THE GATEWAY OF WHAT HAPPENS IN

02:24:00.264 --> 02:24:01.632
TWENTY THIRTY SO IT COULD BE

02:24:01.699 --> 02:24:03.101
THAT WE NEED A BANK THAT'S

02:24:03.167 --> 02:24:05.470
COMPILED SOURCES NEED A BANK. OF

02:24:05.536 --> 02:24:06.671
THREE HUNDRED MILLION TONS OF

02:24:06.738 --> 02:24:07.672
TWENTY THIRTY IN ORDER TO

02:24:07.739 --> 02:24:08.940
ACHIEVE THAT THAT'S YOUR GOAL IN

02:24:09.007 --> 02:24:10.074
WHICH CASE THEY'LL BE AMPLE

02:24:10.141 --> 02:24:11.175
EMISSION REDUCTIONS THE

02:24:11.242 --> 02:24:12.643
STOCKADE. SO THAT THEY CAN

02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:14.579
PRESERVE THAT BANK AND USE THEM

02:24:14.645 --> 02:24:16.481
LATER ON IN THE PROCESS WHEN IT

02:24:16.547 --> 02:24:18.416
BECOMES REALLY. INCREASINGLY

02:24:18.483 --> 02:24:20.118
AMBITIOUS AND THE AND DIFFICULT

02:24:20.184 --> 02:24:21.586
TO ACHIEVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS

02:24:21.652 --> 02:24:23.621
THAT'S WHAT. A PLANNER CAN'T

02:24:23.688 --> 02:24:25.223
REALLY KNOW THAT UNTIL THERE'S A

02:24:25.289 --> 02:24:26.924
FULL VERSION OF TERMSWHAT'S

02:24:26.991 --> 02:24:28.092
GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE WHOLE

02:24:28.159 --> 02:24:29.894
COURSE OF THE CLUB POLICY

02:24:29.961 --> 02:24:31.396
PORTFOLIO FOR THE STATE. SO

02:24:31.462 --> 02:24:37.535
THAT'S WHAT. I WOULD SORT OF

02:24:37.602 --> 02:24:39.270
BACK UP SHE WAS A BIG CHALLENGE.

02:24:39.337 --> 02:24:40.071
THAT IS PICTURE- I ONE MIGHT

02:24:40.138 --> 02:24:41.739
SUSPECT I COULD GO ON FOR A LONG

02:24:41.806 --> 02:24:43.641
TIME ON THIS SUBJECT BUT I HAVE

02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:44.809
GOTTEN THE RED FLAG BECAUSE I

02:24:44.876 --> 02:24:46.544
NEED TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC

FOR MANY TAKE COULD TAKE IN

02:25:05.797 --> 02:25:08.132
CALIFORNIA AND MEETING OUR

POLICIES THAT INCREASE THE COST

02:29:11.842 --> 02:29:15.146
OF. COMPLIANCE AND THEREFORE-INCREASE THE COST THE CALIFORNIA

IMPACTS TO SOCIETY. BUT AS

02:29:41.972 --> 02:29:44.075
MENTIONED BY JOHN WOO THE SIMPLE

02:29:44.141 --> 02:29:45.843
SOLUTION TO THE BANK IS TO

02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:47.678

02:29:47.745 --> 02:29:48.779

THE PRICE WITHIN THIS PROGRAM

02:30:57.081 --> 02:30:58.282
