YOU HAD MENTIONED IN YOUR

TESTIMONY THAT- THE CITY OF SAN

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:20.004
DIEGO ALREADY ENFORCESA POLICY

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:21.205
SIMILAR TO THIS ONE AND THAT

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:23.007
THE TIME AND EXPENSE THAT WAS-

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:23.775

00:32:23.841 --> 00:32:26.010
THAT THE- OPPOSITION ALSO RAISE

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:26.878
THAT POINT WITH THIS MAKE

00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:28.446
THINGS LESS EXPENSIVE FOR SAN

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:31.549
DIEGO- NO I'M NOT. I'M NOT

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:32.150

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:35.453
POSSIBLE RIGHT IN THE CITY HAS

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.221
AN INDEFINITE DETENTION POLICY

00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:39.657
CURRENTLY THIS. PAUL THE BILL

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:41.659
BEFORE YOU SET IT AT TWO YEARS.

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:42.827
OF WHERE WOULD ACTUALLY

00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:44.028
PROBABLY SAVE MONEY IT WOULD BE

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:45.630
A BETTER LOCAL EXAMPLE WOULD BE

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:46.631
A SANTA UNIFIED SCHOOL

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:48.099

00:32:48.166 --> 00:32:50.068

00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:51.035
IN SIGNIFICANT A COSTLY

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:53.304
LITIGATION- THAT. SUBSEQUENTLY

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:55.506
TOOK MONEY FROM OUR CLASSROOMS-

00:32:55.573 --> 00:32:57.542
SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE

00:32:57.608 --> 00:32:59.077
SAVINGS IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING

00:32:59.143 --> 00:32:59.844
CLEAR GUIDANCE THE RETENTION OF

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:02.213
THESE EMAILS. REDUCING THE NEED

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.514
FOR LITIGATION BY THOSE SEEKING

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:05.416
THEIR RIGHT THE CONSTITUTION TO

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:06.617
INFORMATION. TO THE GENERAL

00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:08.453
THIS WOULD BE LESS EXPENSIVE

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:09.420
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT RATHER

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:10.755
THAN MORE EXPENSIVE. WHAT FOR

00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:12.523
SOME I MEAN FOR SOME THAT TO

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.591
HAVE AND INDEFINITE POLICIES

00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:14.692
ANY THAT'S PUT IT PLATE.

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:16.361
PROBABLY PRETTY OBVIOUS. I

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:17.061
THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:18.363
PROVIDING IT'S CLEAR THAT A

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:20.064
DIRECTION TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:21.899
A COULD MITIGATE LITIGATION-

00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:23.801
STORAGE COSTS YOU KNOW AT THAT

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:26.204
COMES UP OFTEN- OF THERE IS THE

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.572
ARGUMENT ALREADY THAT THESE ARE

00:33:27.638 --> 00:33:28.906
OF ATTAINABLE UNDER THE PUBLIC

00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:31.676
RECORDS ACT. LAW HOWEVER A MOST

00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:33.144
MANY OF THEM ARE BEING DELETED

00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:35.213
AFTER THIRTY DAYS- SO. YOU

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.081
KNOW. I WILL LET YOU WAY FOR

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:39.250
YOURSELF- THE MATHEMATICS OF

00:33:39.317 --> 00:33:41.319
THIS- BUT I THINK THE COSTS-

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:42.687
THE CONCERNS ABOUT COSTS ARE

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.455
OFTEN OVER EXAGGERATED. ON YOU

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:45.556
CAN SEE THAT I KNOW YOU KNOW

00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:47.425
TECHNOLOGY QUITE WELL. THE COST

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:48.626
OF THE DATA STORAGE HAS GONE

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:50.495
DOWN DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT

00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:51.562
YEARS. I AGREE WITH YOU I MEAN

00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:54.298
THE- DATA STORAGE IS NOT WE'RE

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:54.932
TALKING ABOUT HERE THE COST IS

00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:58.035
STORED TO SENSUALLY ZERO. BUT

00:33:58.102 --> 00:33:59.303
YOU KNOW AND I THINK WE'RE

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:01.973
UNIFIED IN OUR DESIRE TO BE- OR

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:05.109
TRANCE. WITH A POP AT ALL. GOV

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:07.945
BUT- THE PROBLEM I THINK IS

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:08.780
THAT THE IF YOU ARE A IS BROKEN.

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.348
WITH HER. TO DO RECORDS AND

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:11.482
MORE AND OF OUR RED ARE DID YOU

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:18.289
INCLUDING. EMAIL FOR. SO HERE

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:19.524
IT'S NOT TO. EXPAND ON THIS

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.692
IT'S BROKE I MEAN IF THAT WILL

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:23.928
A CITIZEN SOME A UNDER THE CPR

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:25.396
A FOR RECORDS THE FACT THAT A

HUMAN IS COMBING THROUGH

SOMETHING THAT'S RELEVANT TO

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:30.802
THAT REQUEST IS RIDICULOUS

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:32.069
THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT OUGHT TO

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:34.539
BE DONE- SOMEHOW WE NEED TO AS

00:34:34.605 --> 00:34:36.407
A SOCIETY GET TO A POINT WHERE.

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:37.508

WHAT THEY'RE INVESTIGATING

00:34:48.453 --> 00:34:50.321
WHAT'S NOT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT

00:34:50.388 --> 00:34:51.322
SHOULD BE SOMETHING THE

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:52.390
GOVERNMENT DOES IT SHOULD BE

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:53.357

REMOVED REDACTED THESE ARE

00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:30.254
SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND IT IS

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:31.622
GOING TO HAVE WHETHER THIS IS A

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:34.859
SMALL- AGENCY SMALL DISTRICT OR

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:36.527
IT'S A EXTREMELY LARGE ONE THE

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:38.329
LARGER THEY ARE THE MORE EMAILS

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:39.263
ARE GOING TO HAVE. THE WAR

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.531
CHINESE ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:43.868
TO ENSURE THE WHAT WE'RE

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:46.938
RELEASING. IS SAFE. THE IS IT

00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:50.474
DOESN'T. PUT CITIZENS OR

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:52.209
EMPLOYEES AT RISK. AND SO THERE

00:36:52.276 --> 00:36:53.344
IS SIGNIFICANT COST WITH JUST

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:56.380
GOING THROUGH THOSE EMAILS. AND

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:58.316
FOR US WE HAVE STUDENT AS WELL

00:36:58.382 --> 00:37:00.151
AS EMPLOYER RECORDS THAT WE

00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:00.718
MUST ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:03.154
VIOLATING. ABOUT WERE FOR PAUL

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:04.322
LOSS SAID THAT'S THE PROBLEM

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:05.790
WITH US THAT HALF OF OUR SCHOOL

00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:08.025
DISTRICTS ARE SMALLS- HALF OF

00:37:08.092 --> 00:37:09.627
OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE LESS

00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:11.095
THAN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

00:37:11.162 --> 00:37:12.263
STUDENTS AND THEN THAT MEANS.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.764
THAT'S THE SCOPE HOW MANY STAFF

00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:15.933
WE GOT A WE HAVE WITH THEM. IN

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.868
TRYING TO ASSESS HOW DO WE

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:21.806
DETERMINED AND HOW DO WE MEET

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:22.406
THE REQUIRED THE REQUEST THAT

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:23.307
COME IN WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:24.875
IN REQUESTS COMING IN BECAUSE

00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:26.243
OF THE CHANGES UNDER LOCAL

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.311
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. PEOPLE

00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:29.380
ARE INTRIGUED AWARE SCHOOLS ARE

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:31.549
NOW. RE DIRECTING RESOURCES SO

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:33.184
WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBER OF PR

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.286
RABOR CLASS. INCREASE IN THE

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:37.088
LAST FIVE YEARS AND YET OUR

00:37:37.154 --> 00:37:39.490
TECHNOLOGY HASN'T KEPT UP.

00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:41.158
BECAUSE MANY OF OUR RULES SITES

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:43.327
DON'T HAVE STRONG CONNECTIVITY

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:44.562
SO WE'RE STILL BUILDING OUT

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:45.863
WE'RE STILL UNFORTUNATELY

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:46.964
LIVING IN THE TWENTIETH

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:49.066
CENTURY. IN TERMS OF THE WAY WE

00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:51.002
ADMINISTERED EDUCATION IN THE

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:51.936
STATE. SO IT WOULD SEEM TO ME

00:37:52.003 --> 00:37:53.537
THAT SOME VERSION THAT ANALYSIS

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:54.572
HAS TO BE DONE EVEN WITHOUT

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:55.973
THIS BILL IT'S JUST. LIKE WHO

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.108
MAKES THE DECISION WHETHER OR

00:37:57.174 --> 00:37:58.542
NOT RETAIN RIGHT NOW IS THAT

00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:59.710
DONE BY THE INDIVIDUAL. I

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:01.512
EMPLOYEE OR IS IT DONE MORE

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:03.581
HOLISTICALLY. IT'S DUE WITH SO

00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:04.982
WE'RE PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:06.851
WHAT IS A- A RECORD WHAT IS A

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:08.686
DOCUMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:11.288
KEEP SO. USUALLY WHAT IT IS THE

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:13.024
ATTACHMENT THIS IS ASSOCIATED

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.058
WITH AN EMAIL. THAT IS THE

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:15.993
DOCUMENT THAT IS THE RECORD

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.928
THAT IT THAT IS CAPPED- THE-

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.530
THINGS LIKE OUT OF OFFICE

BUT- OFTENTIMES WHAT THOSE DUES

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:38.616
THE QUOTE DOES GO BACK ON TWO

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:40.084
SEPARATE SERVERS SO THEY'RE NOT

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:44.789
REALLY. GONE THEY THE- SO

00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:49.493
EXAMPLE FOR DISTRICT. I'M HERE

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.095
THE- IF ONE OF YOUR- WERE. ANY

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.897
IN THE- IT'S- ON THE LEAD.

00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:54.598
SERVER AND THE LEGISLATURE. GO

THROUGH IN THE LEADS THOSE

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.068
THINGS SO THEY'RE NOT. REALLY

00:38:57.134 --> 00:38:58.969
GONNA IN INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES

TO LEADING THEM BUT THEY'RE

00:38:59.937 --> 00:39:01.372
PROVIDED CERTAIN GUIDANCE ON.

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:03.474
THESE RECORDS THESE DOCUMENTS

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:04.308
THAT WERE PROVIDING TO THE

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:06.777
PUBLIC THAT HAVE. A POLICY THAT

00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:09.146
HAVE A- AN ACT THAT WE ARE

00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:11.515
WORKING ON OR PROVIDE GUIDANCE

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:12.016
TO THE PUBLIC THOSE ARE

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:13.784
DOCUMENTS THAT ARE ALL CAP. BUT

00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:15.753
INSIGNIFICANT EMAILS AND THAT

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.121
THAT WOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED

00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:18.656
ABLE UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS

00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:20.224
ACT. THOSE KIND OF THINGS ARE

00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:22.159
DELETED. AFTER AFTER WHATEVER

00:39:22.226 --> 00:39:24.528
THAT IS THE POLICY THAT THAT-

00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:26.931
AGENCY HAS ESTABLISHED. AND OUR

00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:28.733
SCHOOLS AS I MENTIONED WE HAD

00:39:28.799 --> 00:39:30.067
WE FOLLOW REGULATIONS THAT WE

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:31.869
HAVE FOUR CLASSIFICATIONS ON

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.671
HOW WE RETAIN INFORMATION SO WE

00:39:33.738 --> 00:39:35.172
TRAIN OUR STAFF. IN TERMS OF

00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:37.508
ITS PERMANENT RECORDS. EXAMPLES

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:39.176
ARE PERSONAL RECORDS PAYROLL

00:39:39.243 --> 00:39:41.045
AND SCHOOL BOARD MINUTES IS A

00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:43.414
CLASSIFIED AS OPTIONAL RECORDS

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:44.648
THESE CAN BE SOMETHING THAT

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:47.885
OCCURS. IN TERMS OF A TIME LINE

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:50.721
OF- AT DEAD DISCUSSION YOU KNOW

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:51.789
THAT'S WORTH THE OF TEMPORARY

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:53.691
PERSPIRATION BETWEEN THE

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:54.658
SUPERINTENDENT AND IT DOES IT

00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:57.862
MEAN. AND SO WE WERE TAKING

00:39:57.928 --> 00:39:58.429
THEM FOR AN- FOR A SPECIFIC

00:39:58.496 --> 00:39:59.597
TIME FRAME BEFORE THEY'RE JUST

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:00.898
STORY AND THEN WE HAVE THE

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:02.333
DISPOSABLE RECORDS WITH WHICH

00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:04.268
WE HAVE DETERMINED. THAT THERE

00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:05.703
OPTIONAL THAT THE CAMPUS

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.738
DESTROYED WITHIN A- AFTER THE

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:10.307
THIRD. JULY ONE PERSON US

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:11.809
EXCEEDING THE COMPLETION OF ALL

00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:13.344
LEGAL REQUIREMENT WE'RE NOT

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:14.812
ASKING THAT EMAIL TO YOUR

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:16.814
SECOND. EMAIL PANOPLY OF I

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:17.548
DON'T KNOW THAT I GOT MY

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:18.816
QUESTION PRESS WE HAVE I'M

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:20.584
CLASSIFIED UNDER SCHOOLS BY

00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.520
CATEGORIES SO I THINK THE

00:40:22.586 --> 00:40:24.021
PROBLEM IS THAT NOT ALL PUBLIC

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.589
AGENCIES HAVE THE SPECIFIC

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:27.892
PROTOCOLS IN PLACE RIGHT. POINT

00:40:27.958 --> 00:40:28.726
POINT AS THE I GUESS IS MY

00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:30.394
QUESTION IS IF YOU'RE HAVING TO

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:32.396
DO THAT ANALYSIS RIGHT NOW AND

00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:34.932
CITING WHAT TO. DELETE IN

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:36.000
ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR EXISTING

00:40:36.066 --> 00:40:38.135
POLICIES. WHY IS THAT PROCESS

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:40.204
NECESSARILY LESS BURDENSOME AND

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.639
THE PROCESS YOU FEAR WOULD TAKE

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:42.473
PLACE IN A MISTER GLORIA'S

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.275
BELLER HAVING TO DO THAT

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:45.509
ANALYSIS IN RESPONSE. ALRIGHT

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:46.944
REQUESTS WE THINK IT JUST

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:50.514
EXPANDS THE SCOPE BECAUSE IT'S

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:51.048
SUCH A BROAD BILL AT THIS

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:52.216
POINT. WOULD MEAN WHEN WE'RE

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:53.517
WEBER AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO BE

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:55.753
KEEPING EVERY EMAIL IT'S ABOUT

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.389
THE RESPONSE. TO THE C. P. R.

00:40:58.455 --> 00:40:59.590
A. RICK US IT'S- IN THE STORE

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:02.426
IS A- LOW THE COST RIGHT NOW.

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:04.128
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COST

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:05.129
WILL BE IN THE FUTURE WE CAN'T

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:07.898
PREDICT WHAT MICROSOFT- IS

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:08.933
GOING TO CHARGE US AND- PERHAPS

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.401
ONCE THEY SEE THAT WE HAVE BY

LAW. TO RETAIN AND MAINTAIN A

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:13.604
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STORAGE THEY

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:15.472
MAY CHANGE THEIR PRICING. OF

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:16.874
THE AND THAT THAT WAS

00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:18.275
HIGHLIGHTED IN THE DEPARTMENT

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:20.044

FINANCE WE'LL SEE OF THIS BILL

00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:23.013
LAST THE WHILE COSTS. FOR

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.982
STORAGE MAY BE LOW NOW WE CAN'T

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:28.819
PREDICT. WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:41:28.886 --> 00:41:29.820

YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT. A LOT

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:39.363
OF OUR BILLS ON A LOT OF THE

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:40.965
CURRENT LAN TRANSPARENCY

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:42.700
RELATES TO WHEN WE WERE

00:41:42.766 --> 00:41:45.903
STRICTLY A PAPER. SOCIETY AND

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.372
WHEN WE RECEIVE LETTERS FROM

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:52.543
CONSTITUENTS- AND WHEN A MEMOS

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.011
WENT BACK AND FORTH IN INTER

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:55.779
OFFICE MAIL WENT BACK AND FORTH

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:57.882
IN THOSE FOLDERS THAT YOU BUT

00:41:57.948 --> 00:41:59.884
HERE THAT'S NOT THE CASE NOW

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.852
AND SO YOU'RE LEGISLATION

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:03.721
ATTEMPTING TO DEAL WITH THIS

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:05.623
TRANSFORMATION AND HOW

00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:06.156
GOVERNMENT DEALS WITH THE

00:42:06.223 --> 00:42:08.626
PUBLIC I THINK IS IMPORTANT-

00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:09.193
ALSO TO IN TERMS OF STORAGE

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.762
CROSS EYED. I DO THINK THAT

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:15.032
THIS COULD LEAD TO- PUT IN A

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:16.800
POTENTIALLY LEAD TO MORE COSTS

00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:18.669
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT I THINK BY

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:20.304
AND LARGE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT

00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:22.206
STORAGE COSTS ARE ON. A

00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:25.442
MICROSOFT AGO EVEN IPHONE OF

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:25.976
THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT FOR

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:28.579
EXAMPLE USED APPLE THIS ABLE TO

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:31.115
STORE FOR NINETY NINE CENTS A

00:42:31.181 --> 00:42:31.649
MONTH FOR INDIVIDUALS FOR

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:33.183
EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW THE COST IS

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.818
PROBABLY AN EQUITABLE IN

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:38.789
ADDITION- IN TERMS OF WHAT IT

00:42:38.856 --> 00:42:41.759
IS THIS NOTION OF THAT THERE IS

00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:43.193
SOME CONFUSION THERE COULD BE

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.795
SOME CONFUSION AS WHAT. WHAT IS

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:46.830
TO BE SAFE OR NOT THAT'S THAT

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:47.898
COULD HAPPEN NOW I MEAN THAT

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.433
YOUR BILL DOESN'T CHANGE WHAT.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:54.838
IS BUT- WHAT IS DISCOVERABLE ON

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:57.508
UNDER A PUBLIC RECORDS. REQUEST

00:42:57.574 --> 00:42:58.676
IF SOMEBODY'S TALKING ABOUT

00:42:58.742 --> 00:42:59.944
GOING TO LUNCH THAT WAS NEVER

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:00.945
DISCOVERABLE THAT'S NOT

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:01.745
RELEVANT TO THE PUBLIC

00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:04.715
BUSINESS- SPAM EMAILS SOME OF

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:05.549
THESE THINGS THAT ARE BEING

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:07.518
BROUGHT UP WEREN'T RELEVANT

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:08.419
BEFORE THEY'RE NOT RELEVANT

00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:11.455
NOW- IT IT. AND JUST A

00:43:11.522 --> 00:43:12.990
CURIOSITY ACTUALLY ONE THING

FOLKS IF THEY FEEL LIKE THAT'S

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:35.212
TOO MUCH- THERE WAS A TIME IN

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:36.714
MY LIFE I PROPOSE ONE YEAR AND

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.882
THAT WAS NOT WELL RECEIVED- BY

LANDED IT TO- IF FOLKS HAVE A

00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:44.355
GENIUS IDEA MISTRAL NOT HE'S

00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:45.422
GOT NEVADA AND HIS MIND OF

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:46.623

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.258
LIKE IN THE FUTURE EIGHT A

00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:50.294
MAULERS BUT A BUT HONESTLY THAT

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:51.595
WAS WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A HAPPY

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:53.397
MEDIUM OF GOLDILOCKS OPTION IF

HAPPENING WITHIN THE

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.412
GOVERNMENT. AND SO EVEN IF

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:09.747
THERE ARE SOME INCIDENTAL COSTS

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:11.081
THAT GO WITH THAT I THINK THESE

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:12.282
ARE IMPORTANT COSTS THAT THE

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:13.183
LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.586
TO. KEEP THESE DOCUMENTS AT A

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:19.223
TIME WHEN- BUT THE WAY THE

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:19.990
PUBLIC INTERACTS WITH

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:21.358
GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED OR IS

00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:23.861

TO SOME DEGREE I THINK IT'S

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:04.628
IMPORTANT HONE IN ON HOW YOU

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:07.164

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:49.072
OF CLIPS. BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN A

00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:51.575
REAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT AN

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:54.077
APPROPRIATE TIME. WOULD OR

00:46:54.144 --> 00:46:58.048
SHOULD LOOK LIKE. AND I'M SORRY

00:46:58.115 --> 00:46:59.516
FOR MY IGNORANCE BUT WHEN IT

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:01.185
WAS PAPER WHAT IS THE

00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:05.222
REQUIREMENT FOR. TWO YEARS TWO

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:07.624
YEARS OKAY SO THAT'S- WHAT THE

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:09.526
THAT'S THE MORNING. THIS IS

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:10.761
EXACTLY THE ISSUE OF GETTING TO

00:47:10.827 --> 00:47:12.062
BUY IS THAT YOU HAVE THIS

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:13.931
REQUIREMENT FOR EXISTING IT

00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:16.533
WILL HIS STARK DOCUMENTS-

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.269
EQUALIZING THAT- WITH THIS

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.904
AGAIN IS A DIFFERENT FROM

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:22.239
WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING WITH

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:22.839
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:24.575
FAR FAR LOWER OR IN SOME CASES

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:26.210
FAR HIGHER REQUIREMENTS OF

00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:27.578
PROVIDING THIS GUIDANCE IN THE

00:47:27.644 --> 00:47:29.479
STATE. OF WHAT THIS COULD BE

00:47:29.546 --> 00:47:30.914
FINDING IT AS SUCH AS MR MAJOR

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:32.349
TALK ABOUT WITH HOW WE

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:33.617
COMMUNICATE TODAY AS WE'VE DONE

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:35.219
IN THE PAST THAT'S WERE COMING

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:37.654
FROM. AGAIN IF CALL IS TRULY

00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:38.288
THE CONCERN THAT WE COULD

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:39.423
POTENTIALLY TALK ABOUT THAT

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:41.692
FURTHER- BUT I THINK THAT WE

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:42.492
NEED TO HAVE THE DIGITAL

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:43.460
CONVERSATION OF THE GOVERNOR ON

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:44.728
WHAT'S NECESSARY AND I THINK

00:47:44.795 --> 00:47:46.230
THE OPPONENT TO HEAR TODAY NEED

00:47:46.296 --> 00:47:47.564
TO RECOGNIZE THE ELECTRNIC

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:48.699
COMMUNICATION IS HOW WE

00:47:48.765 --> 00:47:50.400
COMMUNICATE TODAY AND SO A BILL

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:52.135
WILL PASS. QUESTION IS WHAT CAN

00:47:52.202 --> 00:47:52.970
WE DO TO MAKE THIS EASIER ON

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:56.073
THEM RIGHT- SO ON THE TEARS I'M

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:59.009
SORRY JUST YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF

00:47:59.076 --> 00:47:59.610
YOU KNOW THE HISTORICAL WHAT.

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:01.144
WHITE YOU DON'T KNOW WHY THAT

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.346
WAY BETTER THAN THE COMPETITION

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:06.016
IS HAVE HIT A ROOM. LIKE THIS

00:48:06.083 --> 00:48:07.351
AND- YEAH I AM. YOU KNOW WE- I

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:08.352
THINK WE BOUNCE HISTORY. A LOT

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:09.519
IN A PRESS. LAST YEAR BECAUSE

00:48:09.586 --> 00:48:11.722
OF THE RELATION TO COST AND- OF

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:13.624
COURSE. AS THINGS CHANGE

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:14.625
WRITTEN DOCUMENTS THAT WE KEPT

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.426
WERE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN.

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:18.629
MASSIVE THE EMAILS IT'S EIGHTY

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:19.796
ONE GOT A LAUNCHER YOU KNOW THE

00:48:19.863 --> 00:48:22.032
CHAIN OF EMAILS THAT. COULD OR

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:23.867
COULD NOT BE. RELATED TO THE

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:27.838
ACTUAL. DISCOVERABLE DOCUMENT-

00:48:27.904 --> 00:48:30.807
IF YOU. BY CHANCE IN AND MOVING

00:48:30.874 --> 00:48:33.076
TO APPROPRIATIONS COULD. A

00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:34.478
NURSE ANY OF THAT I MEAN WE CAN

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:35.245
DO THAT WORK I'M JUST VERY

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:37.748
CURIOUS I ON HOW WE GOT TO TWO.

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:40.284
IS THAT THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER-

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:43.587
ESPECIALLY. IN AN EMAIL FORM

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:44.921
WHERE SO MUCH MORE IS BEING

00:48:44.988 --> 00:48:46.223
RETAINED OF THEM WOULD HAVE

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.525
BEEN RETAINED RENT DOCUMENTS I.

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:50.694
AND I'M I'M- FOR TRANSPARENCY

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:52.629
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S GOOD I.

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:53.764
YOU KNOW ALMOST WAS CONVINCED

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.332
MAYBE SHOULD BE LONGER THAN TWO

00:48:55.399 --> 00:48:56.099
YEARS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COST A

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:57.834
LOT TO STORE BUT WE WANTED TO

00:48:57.901 --> 00:49:00.270
BE MANAGEABLE AS WELL AND WE'VE

00:49:00.337 --> 00:49:02.739
ALL SEEN THOSE. REYES FOR

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:05.075
POLITICAL REASONS THAT THAT ARE

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:06.810
MASSIVE AND YOU KNOW REALLY

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:10.213
HAVE NO. DESIRE BUT TO FIND

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.417
SOME GOTCHA DOCUMENT- OBVIOUSLY

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:16.720
THAT THAT IS EVERYBODY'S RIGHT

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:17.888
TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT BUT I'D

00:49:17.954 --> 00:49:20.324
LOVE TO REALLY NOBLE STAND MORE

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:22.759
HOW WE GOT TO TWO YEARS WHY

00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:23.794
THAT'S IN A PART NUMBER AND IF

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.163
THAT SHOULD BE A APPROPRIATE.

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:28.765
ARE MOVING FORWARD SCRIPTED

00:49:28.832 --> 00:49:31.835
THAT THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE.

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:32.736
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:35.339
GLORIA ARE IT AND ACTUALLY

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:37.341
THINK THIS DISCUSSION POINTS

00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:38.608
OUT WHY SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:40.410
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THE TWO

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:41.712
YEARS I'M NOT SURE IN THE

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:43.113
HISTORY OF THE TWO YEARS AROUND

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.482
DOCUMENT RETENTION. PROBABLY

00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:47.551
WASN'T CHASING AT SOME POINT.

00:49:47.617 --> 00:49:49.086
THAT RECORDS ARE HELD LONG

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:50.787
ENOUGH FOR AN ISSUE TO BE

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:52.856
DISCOVERED AND THEN. AND THEN

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:54.458
B. B. SOCK DOCUMENTS GET

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:56.026
SOUGHT. BUT SOME OF THE

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:57.094
COMMENTS WILL FIRST OF ALL THE

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.595
STORAGE COSTS QUESTION TO ME

00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:00.597
IS. SPEECHES I MEAN THAT'S

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.332
RIDICULOUS IT'S NOT GOING TO GO

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:04.334
UP IT'S DOING NOTHING BUT GOING

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:06.970
DOWN YOU CAN BY. NOW BY FOR

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:10.207
PRETTY DARN CHEAP. BUT THE FACT

00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:12.209
THAT SOMEBODY CAN SIT HERE

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:14.611
GLIBLY SAY WELL WE'RE GONNA

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:16.012
HAVE TO STORE ALL OF THESE

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:18.281
USELESS EMAILS. HOW DO WE KNOW

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:19.750
THEY'RE USELESS BUT WE HAVEN'T

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:22.052
SET A STANDARD AND YES

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:22.552
ATTACHMENTS CAN BE VERY

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:24.588
IMPORTANT. MAYBE WEEK WE CAN

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:26.556
DRAW SOME DISTINCTION THERE BUT

00:50:26.623 --> 00:50:28.258
OFTEN TIMES THERE IS

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:29.259
INFORMATION THERE ARE

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:31.128
ADMISSIONS THERE ARE THINGS IN

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:34.331
THE BODY OF AN EMAIL THAT CAN

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:36.133
BE VERY SIGNIFICANT TO LINE OF

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:38.168
INQUIRY AND VERY DIFFICULT FOR

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:40.337
US TO SAY. THAT'S NOT PROBATIVE

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:41.204
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:43.540
GOING TO BE SOUGHT- FRANKLY

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:44.674
SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:46.877
PUBLIC AGENCIES. IF PEOPLE ARE

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:49.379
USING THEIR PUBLIC AGENCY EMAIL

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:50.647
TO SET UP LUNCH STATES ROBERT

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:52.816
WE NOT AN APPROPRIATE USE OF A

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.718
STATE RESOURCE. I KNOW THAT

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:57.921
HAPPENS. BUT THESE. THERE

00:50:57.988 --> 00:50:59.956
PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE SOME.

00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:02.259
DISCIPLINE AROUND HOW EMAILS

00:51:02.325 --> 00:51:04.694
GET USE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL

00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:05.429
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:06.296
THAT IS THE MEANS OF

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:07.864
COMMUNICATION THAT I DO

00:51:07.931 --> 00:51:09.766
UNDERSTAND I HAVE BEEN BEAT UP

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:10.534
LOCALLY OVER THIS BILL LAST

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:15.138
YEAR. THAT POTENTIAL COST. THEY

00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:17.874
ARE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY

00:51:17.941 --> 00:51:19.676
BEING HELD ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:21.645
COMPUTER BECAUSE THAT

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:22.679
INDIVIDUAL MIGHT BE CALLING

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:24.247
THROUGH THOSE DEPENDING ON WHAT

00:51:24.314 --> 00:51:26.249
THE AGENCY'S STANDARDS ARE BUT

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:27.884
THEY DO EXIST EITHER IN AN

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:29.886
ARCHIVE OR ON AND AGENCIES

00:51:29.953 --> 00:51:31.655
SERVER THE FACT THAT IT'S ON A

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:33.123
SERVER ALSO MAKES IT MORE

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:34.891
INHERENTLY SEARCHABLE NOW I

00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:36.293
DON'T KNOW MISERABLE NOLTE FOR

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:37.594
RIGHT. FOR THE DAY WHEN

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:39.396
EVERYTHING THAT WE GENERATE BUT

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:40.597
BY EMAIL ALL THESE

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:41.131
COMMUNICATIONS ARE

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:42.732
AUTOMATICALLY THEN SENT UP AND

00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:46.169
SEARCHABLE BY EVERYONE- WE YOU

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:48.705
CAN YEAH- THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:50.207
THIS BILL IS ABOUT THAT'S A

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:51.875
THAT'S A SEPARATE DISCUSSION

00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:53.810
ABOUT. THAT REALLY THAT THE

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:55.745
OPENNESS AT SOME POINTS. I

00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:57.080
DON'T DISAGREE WE MAY BE THERE

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:58.915
OR SOMEWHERE LIKE IT BUT I

00:51:58.982 --> 00:52:00.484
THINK WE AS A SOCIETY ARE STILL

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.586
STRUGGLING WITH WHAT. THE

00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:04.354
DIGITAL WORLD LOOKS LIKE AND

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:06.189
MEANS AND IN THE MEANTIME. FOR

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:07.858
US TO HAVE SUCH A VARIETY OF

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:10.260
POLICIES AT DIFFERENT AGENCIES

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:12.996
SOME SECIFICS I'M NOT SOME AND

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:16.066
KNOWING SOME KIND OF A KNOWING.

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:17.834
THEN SORT OF OBVIOUS GETS THE

00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:19.202
REAL VALUE OF WHAT SOME OF

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:21.171
THESE DOCUMENTS ARE AND IDO

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:22.672
UNDERSTAND THE COST INFORMATION

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:23.840
AND MISS GONZALEZ I THINK

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:25.008
YOU'RE RIGHT TO BE WORRYING

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:27.143
ABOUT THAT BUT IF THE REASON

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:28.712
FOR US TO SAY WE ARE NOT. GOING

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:31.181
TO BE TRANSPARENT IS BECAUSE OF

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:32.916
COSTS WILL THAT SHIP SAILED.

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.384
DECADES AGO AS SOON AS WE

00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:36.219
STARTED DOWN THAT THE PATH OF

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:37.921
PUBLIC RECORDS OF PUBLIC DISCO

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:40.457
DISCLOSURES. SO I'M NOT SURE

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:42.459
HOW WE SOLVE THAT. OR IF IT'S

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:43.827
REALLY SOLVABLE BUT THE FACT OF

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:44.928
THE MATTER IS THERE'S A

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:45.896
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:52:45.962 --> 00:52:47.364
INFORMATION YES THERE'S A LOT

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:49.165
OF CHAFF. BUT THERE'S ALSO

00:52:49.232 --> 00:52:50.867
INFORMATION THAT IS VALUABLE TO

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.235
WHATEVER PUBLIC INQUIRIES COULD

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:53.270
BE THAT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:55.539
SHY. AWAY FROM THAT SIDE I

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:56.640
THINK THAT FROM THIS COMMITTEE

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:58.041
STANDPOINT THE FACT OF THE-

00:52:58.108 --> 00:52:59.242
GOVERNOR VETOED IT. MISTER

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:00.544
GLORIA GOOD LUCK WITH THE

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:01.845
GOVERNOR ON THAT THAT'S BEYOND

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:03.213
WHAT THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.481
LOOK AT. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:06.349
POLICY WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE I

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:07.717
AM VERY SENSITIVE THE COST

00:53:07.784 --> 00:53:09.452
ISSUES HERE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:13.790
ELSE WE CAN DO. IN THIS-SITUATION OTHER THAN TRIED SET

00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:15.158
SOME CLEAR STANDARDS AND MOVE

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:17.994
FORWARD. AND THIS OBERNOLTE

00:53:18.061 --> 00:53:19.262
MAYBE WHEN YOU'RE IN CONGRESS

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:20.630
YOU CAN PROPOSE SOMETHING THAT

00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:23.233
OPENS UP. ALL PUBLIC.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.668
INTERACTIONS TO BE

00:53:24.734 --> 00:53:26.336
AUTOMATICALLY PUBLIC BUT I

00:53:26.403 --> 00:53:29.873
THINK THERE'S SOME BOOKS ON.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:30.440
THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITH

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:31.074
THAT IN MIND. ANYWAY SO I THINK

00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:32.776
THIS MEETS OUR STANDARD IS FOR

00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:34.377
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD MOVE

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:36.012
FORWARD AS IT DID LAST YEAR.

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:36.880
SHE IS WITH THE GOVERNOR AND

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:38.715
OTHERS AND IF THERE IS A BETTER

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:40.450
WAY TO DEFINE OR TO MANAGE

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:41.818
COSTS I WOULD HOPE THAT WE LOOK

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:43.019
AT THAT BECAUSE I THINK FOR ALL

00:53:43.086 --> 00:53:44.788
OF US. THAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE A

00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:47.257
SERIOUS ISSUE BUT UNDERLYING.

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:50.527
THIS IS THE OBLIGATION TO MAKE.

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:52.662
SEND PUBLIC RECORDS AVAILABLE

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:54.130
TO THE PUBLIC IS REALLY WHAT

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:56.766
THIS IS ABOUT SO GLORIA MAY

00:53:56.833 --> 00:53:58.501
CLOSE. THE CHAIRMAN AS USUAL

00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:00.170
YOUR SPOT ON I JUST WANT TO

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:01.371
MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS FOR THE

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:02.672
RECORD. I'LL BE CLEAR THAT I

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:03.607
WILL WORK WITH ANY THE

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:04.908
STAKEHOLDERS AFFECTED TO MAKE

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:05.842
SURE THAT WE END UP WITH A

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:07.577
REASONABLE RESPONSIBLE POLICY.

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:08.912
LIKE YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D

00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:10.480
JERRY CONCERNED ABOUT COST ANY

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.381
OF YOU KNOW ME KNOWING I'D

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.083
CHEAP AS ALL GET OUT SO LISTEN.

00:54:13.149 --> 00:54:14.818
I WILL WORK WITH PEOPLE TO TRY

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:15.585
TO MAKE SURE COSTS ARE

00:54:15.652 --> 00:54:17.253
CONTAINED. BUT I WANT TO MAKE

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.990
pWERE TALKING TO THE TRUE COSTS.

00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:21.057
WHETHER THAT IS THE UNLIMITED

00:54:21.124 --> 00:54:22.158
ATTENTION BY CERTAIN

00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:23.960
JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH PEOPLE

00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:24.761
DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A CONCERN

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:26.329
ABOUT THOSE COSTS OR THE REAL

00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:28.098

JURISDICTIONS AND BETTER LATER.

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:34.070
SOMEHOW DISCOVERED WE KNOW THAT

00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:35.372
THEIR ACOSTA SO DO SUCCEED WITH

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:37.007
OUR CURRENT APPROACH THIS BILL

IS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THAT-

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:39.876
AND- LASTLY I WANT TO SAY IS

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:41.344
SOMEONE WHO CARES DEEPLY ABOUT

00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:43.647
IT ABOUT PRIVACY ISSUES. IN NO

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:45.815
WAY WILL BE DISCLOSING PEOPLES-

00:54:45.882 --> 00:54:48.118
ALREADY- PROHIBITED A PERSONAL

00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:49.519

PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW THIS

00:54:50.987 --> 00:54:52.222
BILL NO WAY EXPANDS THE SCOPE

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:53.823
OF WHAT'S DISCOVERABLE UNDER.

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.291
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WHAT IT

00:54:55.358 --> 00:54:56.993
EXPANDS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT A

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.228
RECORD THAT IS DISCOVERABLE BY

00:54:58.294 --> 00:54:59.963
THE PUBLIC ENTITLED TO THEM BY

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:01.931
OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. IS NOT

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:03.233
THE LEAD ON THE THIRTY FIRST

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:04.768

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.741
THAT TRAUMA KIT SHOULDN'T BE

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:20.043
AVAILABLE IN THESE LOCATIONS

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.577
IT'S THE MANDATE YOU KNOW

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.312
ADDING TO THE MANDATE THAT WE

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:25.915
THAT THESE BE AVAILABLE IN ALL

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:27.283
OF THESE BUILDINGS THAT THAT

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.017
MEET THE CRITERIA THAT YOU'VE

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:30.086
OUTLINED- I JUST WANNA MAKE

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:31.320
SURE THAT WHEN WE MAKE THESE

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:32.422
DECISIONS WERE DOING IT ON THE

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:34.590
BASIS OF STATISTICS AND

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.793
SCIENTIFIC FACT RATHER THAN.

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.261
YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:40.563
GOOD AND THE- PROBLEM THAT I

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.198
HAVE WITH IT IS IF YOU LOOK AT

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:43.666
THE STATISTICS ON YOUR

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.768
LIKELIHOOD OF EXPERIENCING ONE

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:47.537
OF THESE TRAUMA RELATED

01:01:47.603 --> 01:01:49.105
INJURIES IN ONE OF THESE

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:52.442
BUILDINGS IT'S INCREDIBLY LOW I

01:01:52.508 --> 01:01:53.409
MEAN LOWER DOWN YOUR ODDS OF

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:54.510
GETTING OUT BY PUTTING. AND

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:55.945
JUSTICE I'VE SEEN SO WHAT I

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:58.281
PROPOSING THAT. YOU KNOW

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.582
LIGHTNING KITS BE AVAILABLE IN

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:00.716
ALL OF THESE BUILDINGS RIGHT

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.885
AND YET THE DATA WOULD SUGGEST

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.053
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE MORE OF

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.588
A SOCIETAL BENEFIT THAN WHAT'S

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:07.290
IN YOUR BILL SO WHAT. WE HAVE

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:08.458
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:10.426
BECAUSE THE STATISTICS SAY.

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:12.061
THAT PUTTING THIS REQUIREMENT

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:13.196
ON COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:14.697
IS NOT REASONABLE. WELL I CAN

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:16.199
LOOK AT IT AS WHAT WE DO EIGHTY

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:17.667
TEACH RIGHT THERE PRETTY MUCH

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:18.734
WATCHWORD EVERYWHERE THERE

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:20.303
ACTUALLY IN THE CAPITAL. SO I'M

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:21.237
LOOKING AT FROM THAT

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:22.772
PERSPECTIVE. THE CHALLENGES

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.474
THAT WE GOT A E. DIS TO BE

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.242
INSTALLED IN BUILDINGS. SUCH AS

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:28.044
OURS. THAT THE SUGGEST A

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:30.780
SUPPLEMENTAL- SAFETY DEVICE TO

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:32.615
HELP FOLKS AS WE DO A DIS. I

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:33.483
THINK IT'S VERY CHALLENGING

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:34.750
BACK THEN AND I THINK THIS

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:35.852
WOULD PROBABLY CALL SOME

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:36.385
CONCERN WITH FOLKS LIKE

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:38.154
YOURSELF AND OTHERS. THAT IT

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:39.789
MAY NOT BE NEEDED BUT I THINK

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:42.291
AS TIME. MOVES FORWARD AND JUST

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:43.025
TYPES INSTANCE RECEIVED

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:44.927
FREQUENT MARK DURING. THAT IS

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:46.596
SOMETHING AS A JUST AN

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:48.297
ADDITIONAL TOOL AND I DON'T

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:49.499
THINK THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT A

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:51.400
COST AS BEING OR MANDATE

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.369
BECAUSE- VERY COSTS IS VERY

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.770
MINIMAL I THINK OF YOU BY THESE

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:56.672
ITS LARGE SCALE THAT. WE'RE

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:57.373
DOING IS TRYING TO SAVE

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.209
SOMEBODY'S LIFE IF WE TRYING

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.577
TO. BOB POLITICIZED EVENT OR

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:02.812
MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT'S NOT

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:04.347
USEFUL THAN YOU KNOW WHAT ARE

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:05.581
WE SAYING TO FOLKS OUT THERE

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:06.616
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO. HAVE

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:07.617
SOMETHING AVAILABLE TO SAVE

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:09.085
SOMEONE'S LIFE AND IN THIS CASE

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:10.853
IT'S A TOURNIQUET- I THINK I

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.355
HELPS WHEN THEY'RE OUT THE- THE

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:13.723
DIE START. WITH THE CHAIR FOR

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:15.758
ANYONE TO LOOK AT IT IT'S VERY.

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:16.692
VERY SMALL MINIMAL AND IF WE

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:19.562
CAN PUT. HI FIRST AID KIT WITH

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.130
THE TOURNIQUET SUCH AS THOSE

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:23.766
THEIR NEXT TO AN A E. D. AS- WE

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:27.036
DO ALREADY I MEAN AS SOME AREAS

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:28.137
DO ALREADY. HAVE THAT I THINK.

01:03:28.204 --> 01:03:29.505
THE SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING THAT

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:31.574
WE SHOULD- BECAUSE TO CONCERN

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:32.875
BECAUSE OF COST OR OTHER THINGS

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:34.210
OF THAT NATURE. RIGHT NOW IT'S

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:36.546
MORE THE MANDATE. BECAUSE AS I

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:37.747
SAID BEFORE GONNA PUT A MANDATE

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:38.381
ON PEOPLE LET'S MAKE SURE THE

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:40.349
MANDATE MAKES SENSE. AND TO

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.051
YOUR POINT ABOUT EIGHTY D. IS.

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:45.321
THE ODDS OF. SOMEONE NEEDING

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:47.723
ACCESS TO DEVELOP GREATER. IN A

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:48.991
COMMERCIAL BUILDING. YOU KNOW

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:50.793
OUR- UP SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.028
THAN ANYTHING WE'RE TALKING

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:56.199
ABOUT AND- SO. YOU KNOW IT'S- I

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:57.300
THINK WHEN YOU'RE MORE LIKELY

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:58.234
TO GET STRUCK BY LIGHTNING

01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:00.603
THEN. TO NEED A TRAUMA KIT YOU

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:01.404

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:02.805
COMPELLING SO BEING RESPECTFUL

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:04.140
OPPOSITION AS I WAS LAST YEAR

INTENTIONS BY THE BILL AND AS I

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:08.344
SAID. I WISH THAT THE STOOD

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:09.378
SOMERTON PIECE OF IT WOULD HAVE

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:10.713
BEEN SEPARATED OUT BECAUSE I'M

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.814

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:35.077
DOG SPARED FROM A LIFE ALONE IN

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:37.046
A CAGE SUFFERING FROM NAUSEA

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:40.449
VOMITING SEIZURES AND DEATH.

01:08:40.516 --> 01:08:42.685
DOG SUBJECTED TO TOXICITY TESTS

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:44.186
ARE FORCED TO INGEST OR INHALE

01:08:44.253 --> 01:08:46.121
HIGH DOSES OF THE SUBSTANCE

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:46.956
SOME ARE EVEN GIVEN

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:48.691
INTRAVENOUSLY AND THEY ARE

01:08:48.757 --> 01:08:50.893
NEARLY ALWAYS KILLED AT THE END

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.695
OF THE STUDY. THE EPA

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.530
ELIMINATED THE ONE YEAR DOG

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:57.333
TASK MORE THAN A DECADE AGO

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:57.967
BECAUSE THE AGENCY TO TERM THAT

01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.835
THE TASK WAS NOT SCIENTIFICALLY

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:01.837
NECESSARY YET COMPANIES STILL

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.706
CARRY THESE TESTS OUT AND SEND

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:06.542
RESULTS TO THE EPA FOR APPROVAL

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.511
IN THIS SHOULD BE A NO NO. YOU

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:10.513
ASKED WHAT ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY.

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:12.381
I SAY THERE ARE SCIENTIFIC

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:13.816
FLAWS IN TESTING ON DOGS FOR

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:16.352
HUMANS MANY TESTS HAVE RESULTED

01:09:16.418 --> 01:09:18.020
IN FALSE NEGATIVES. THE FAILURE

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:19.622
RATE FOR TOXICITY TESTING OF

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:21.590
DOGS ON ANIMALS IT'S MORE THAN

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:23.659
90% WHEN THE SAME DRUG TESTED

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:26.028
ON HUMANS PUTS THE HUMANS AT

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.263
RISK. SO WHAT DOES THIS TELL

01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:29.698
YOU. IT SAYS THAT THESE

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.867
TOXICITY TESTS DO NOT INSURE

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:33.969
HUMAN SAFETY AND THEY TOTALLY

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:35.838
DISREGARD CANINE LIFE.

01:09:35.905 --> 01:09:37.606
CALIFORNIA IS PROUD TO BE A

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.208
LEADER IN INNOVATION AND

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:40.643
TECHNOLOGY AND THE WORK OF

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:42.278
COMPANIES HERE IN THE STATE ARE

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:43.078
TO WHO ARE DEVELOPING

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:45.114
ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL TESTING

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.182
IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE. ORGAN ON

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:48.918
A CHIP TECHNOLOGIES FOR EXAMPLE

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.553
USE HUMAN CELLS AND STIMULATE

01:09:50.619 --> 01:09:52.521
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE HUMAN

01:09:52.588 --> 01:09:54.657
BODY. WE CAN ALSO USE COMPUTER

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:56.959
MODELING TO ASSESS HISTORICAL

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.194
DATA TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF A

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:01.497
PRODUCT. THESE ALTERNATIVES ARE

01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:03.032
AVAILABLE AND CONTINUE TO

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:05.401
BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED THE

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:07.603
EPA HAS EMBRACED THIS APPROACH

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:09.104
AS A WAY FORWARD AND ACTUALLY

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:11.073
PLANS TO ELIMINATE ALL TESTING

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.142
ON MAMMALS FOR PESTICIDES AND

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:14.510
CHEMICALS BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:17.079
FIVE. THE FDA IS ALSO WORKING

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:18.681
ON A PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY ROAD

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:21.016
MAP SEEKS TO REDUCE ANIMAL

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:23.419
TESTING. NOW THESE APPROACHES

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:26.989
IMPACT ALL ANIMALS BUT AB

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.557
TWENTY FIFTY NINE IS JUST ABOUT

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:31.961
THE DOGS. BUT WHAT IT SAYS IS

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:33.362
THAT WE DO NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:36.665
BETWEEN HUMAN LIFE AND DOG LIFE

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:38.000
PASSING AB TWENTY FIFTY NINE

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.735
MEANS WE CAN SAVE CANINE LIVES

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:41.770
AND PROTECT HUMAN SAFETY BY

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:43.372
CARRYING OUT RELEVANT AND

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:45.641
REQUIRED REQUIRED TOXICITY

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:48.811
TESTING IN NEW WAYS. THAT ARE

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:51.113
MORE RELIABLE AND SAFE FOR. NOW

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.481
I WILL ALSO SAY THAT ALTHOUGH

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:54.316
THIS BILL HAS BEEN PRINT IN

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:56.251
PRINT FOR OVER A MONTH.

01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:58.220
CONCERNED PARTIES DID NOT SEND

01:10:58.287 --> 01:11:00.356
SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS UNTIL LAST

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:03.125

ACCEPTED CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:06.829
AND I'M OPEN TO CONTINUE THE

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:09.732
CONVERSATION. THAT PROTECT THE

SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES. I

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:47.703
ACTUALLY WORKED FOR SEVERAL

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.538
YEARS AT A PRIMATE BREEDING AND

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:51.640
RESEARCH FACILITY BECAUSE I

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:52.875
CARED ABOUT HUMAN HEALTH AND

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:54.910
ANIMALS I LEFT THE LABORATORY

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.845
FOR THOSE VERY SAME REASONS.

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:57.746
FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND ANIMAL

01:11:57.813 --> 01:12:00.349

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:01.817
FOR TESTING AND RESEARCH THAT

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:03.552
IS MORE HUMAN RELEVANT COST

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:06.221
EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT AND SPARES

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:07.489
ANIMALS FROM SUFFERING. YOU'VE

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:09.091
HEARD HOW NARROW THIS BILL IS

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.926
IT IS ABOUT TOXICITY TESTING

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.428
ONLY THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:13.328
TESTING THIS IS ONLY ABOUT

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:15.264
TOXICITY TESTING NOT REQUIRED

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:16.999
BY FEDERAL LAW. CARRIED OUT ON

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:19.034
DOGS IN FRONT PRODUCTS MEANT

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:21.203
FOR HUMANS NOT DOGS. EXAMPLES

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.538
OF DRUG TESTING THOSE IMPACTED

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:24.239
BY THIS BILL ARE CERTAIN TESTS

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:25.974
ON PESTICIDES FOOD IN COLOR IT

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:28.110
IS HUMAN DRUGS AND OTHERS. MOST

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:29.745
PEOPLE AS YOU HEARD ARE SHOCKED

01:12:29.812 --> 01:12:31.013
TO HEAR THIS IS STILL HAPPENING

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.748
AND TWENTY TWENTY. DOGS ARE

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:33.982
USED TO THESE CHECKS BECAUSE

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:35.651
THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN THEY'RE

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:37.786
COMPLIANT INTERESTING ANIMALS.

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:38.654
AND THAT MAKES IT EASY TO

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:42.424
pINCENTIVE TO STOP. DRUG TESTING

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:43.926
DOESN'T ENSURE HUMAN SAFETY AS

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:44.793
YOU HEARD AND IT'S ACTUALLY

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.395
HARM TO MEN'S JUST TO GIVE AN

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:48.564
EXAMPLE. VIOXX WHICH WAS

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.232
REMOVED FROM THE GLOBAL MARKET

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:52.134
WAS LINKED TO A HUNDRED AND

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:52.935
FORTY THOUSAND HEART ATTACKS IN

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:54.570
HUMANS SIXTY THOUSAND OF THOSE

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.672
FATAL. THIS WAS AFTER SIX

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:58.373
DIFFERENT ANIMAL STUDIES ON

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.209
FOUR SPECIES INCLUDING DOGS

01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:01.043
WHICH SHOWED THAT

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.711
VIDAK: WAS ACTUALLY PROTECTIVE

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:04.613
AGAINST HEART ATTACKS WHEN

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.381
ACTUALLY CAUSE HARM IN HUMANS.

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:07.983
BILL GATES GAY RECENT REMARKS

THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:11.653
MEANING POINTING OUT THAT THIS

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.822
IS TECHNOLOGY. HAS THE

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.057
POTENTIAL THE NON ANIMAL

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:17.025
METHODS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:20.062
SAVE YEARS OF THE TIME. IT

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:21.563
TAKES TO EVALUATE SAFETY OF

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:22.164
DRUGS OF THE PRACTICE AND SAY

RESURGENT CLINICAL TRIALS SO

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:27.035
WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE TO MOVE

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:28.270
AWAY FROM FAILED TESTING ON

EIGHTEEN THE USDA ESTIMATED

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:28.897
THAT FIVE THOUSAND DOGS IN

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:06.488
NON ROAD. WELL I WOULD

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:08.023
CERTAINLY OPEN TO HAVING AN

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:09.624
ETHICAL CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:11.159
ALL SEVENTEENTH BEINGS ARE

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:16.564
TREATED- ON THIS PLANET- BUT I

01:22:16.631 --> 01:22:17.766
THINK AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:19.801
DOGS LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:21.770
HAS SHOWN THAT FALSE NEGATIVES

01:22:21.836 --> 01:22:23.471
HAVE COME AS A RESULT OF SOME

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:25.006
OF THE TESTING SUGGESTS THAT

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:26.908
MAYBE THE THAT'S NOT THE BEST

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:28.777
OR MOST APPROPRIATE SPECIES I

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:31.246
ALSO WANT TO REITERATE AND-

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:33.948
THAT THIS DOES NOT IMPACT

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:35.884
MEDICAL RESEARCH THIS IS NOT

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:36.418
ABOUT THE TESTING FOR THE

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:37.686
EFFICACY OF A DRUG IT'S ABOUT

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:40.021
TOXICITY LEVELS. AND WE'D HAVE

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:41.456
THAT CONVERSATION YEARS AGO

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:43.958
AROUND LEAD PAINT- RIGHT SO

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:46.594
IT'S- NOT ABOUT IF THE PAINT

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:48.163
WORKS IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:50.131
TOXICITY IS IN THE PAIN AND IS

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:51.700
THAT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:53.401
SORT OF CONTINUE TO KEEP OR TO

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:55.503
MOVE AWAY FROM. WE MOVED AWAY

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:58.540
FROM IT- SO YOU CAN YOU CAN

01:22:58.606 --> 01:23:00.308
STILL TEST IT ALSO DOES NOT

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:03.278
IMPACT TESTING ON- DRUGS THAT

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:06.848
ARE USED ON ANIMALS IN ON DOGS.

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:08.883
SO I KNOW THAT THAT WAS STATED

01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:12.487
AND SOME OF THE OPPOSITION.

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:15.890
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE-

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:16.624
DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S OTHER

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:17.826
REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT

01:23:17.892 --> 01:23:19.894
REQUIRE TESTING ON A NON RODENT

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:23.698
SPECIES BESIDES I KNOW YOUR-

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:25.734
MA'AM IN SETTING DEAL WITH THE

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.370
USDA BUT ARE THERE OTHER.

01:23:28.436 --> 01:23:30.572
FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT REQUIRED.

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:33.308
THERE ARE SOME- EPA REGULATIONS

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.076
THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN DRUG TEST

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:36.378
WHICH WOULD BE EXEMPT BY THIS

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:38.546
BILL AND THEN FTA DOES NOT ALL

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:41.483
EDC CDC DOESN'T DO ANY MANDATE

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:44.753
ANY TESTING THEY DO LOOK AT-

01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:45.854
DRUGS FOR EXAMPLE A MAN

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.689
APPROVED BY FDA AND AN ADVOCATE

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:51.693
FOR THIS TO BE. IF THERE WERE

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.928
OTHER. FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT

01:23:53.995 --> 01:23:55.563
REQUIRE THIS ON EARTH BETWEEN

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:57.132
NOW AND APPROPRIATIONS YOU'D BE

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:58.900
WILLING TO YES- SO THIS DOES

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:01.369
SAY THAT THIS EXEMPTS ALL- THAT

01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:03.671
ARE REQUIRED BY LAW BY FEDERAL

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:06.141
LAW I ANY FEDERALLY RIGHT. OKAY

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:07.675
TO FILL FEDERAL AGENCY SAYS

01:24:07.742 --> 01:24:10.478
DOGS SPECIFICALLY YEAH. THAT'S

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:12.947
WHAT WOULD BE EXEMPT. IF IT

01:24:13.014 --> 01:24:16.418
REQUIRES. TESTING ON A NON

01:24:16.484 --> 01:24:20.789
RODENT SPECIES. PACIFIC WE DOCK.

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:25.393
SO IF THERE'S A IF A FEDERAL ID

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.594
OTHER I'M SORRY I'M JUST NOW

01:24:26.661 --> 01:24:28.296
NOW I'M GETTING CONCERNED THAT

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:30.465
WE'RE PICKING LIKE. ONE ANIMAL

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:33.001
UHHUH WENT I MEAN AS A RABBIT

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:34.669
WELL I WOULD CERTAINLY LOVE TO

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:36.805
HAVE OF A BILL THAT SAYS WE

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:39.274
STOP TESTING ON ALL ANIMALS-

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.176
AND I'M SURE THESE NICE PEOPLE

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:42.877
WOULD. NOT LOVE TO HAVE THAT

01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:44.312
AND SO WE ARE CERTAINLY

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:45.380
INTERESTED IN A GLOBAL STEP

01:24:45.447 --> 01:24:49.951
FORWARD- BUT- SOMETIMES IT'S

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.019
IMPORTANT TO TAKE INCREMENTAL

01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:52.320
STEPS SO THAT YOU CAN MOVE

01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:53.688
FORWARD WITH THIS CONVERSATION

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:56.057
BUT I WOULD LOVE IT- IF WE

01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:57.492
COULD SEE THE DAY WERE WERE NOT

01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:59.027
TESTING ON ANY ANIMALS AT ALL.

01:24:59.093 --> 01:25:00.795
DO YOU KNOW BESIDES DOG WHAT

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:03.298
OTHER- ANIMALS ARE BEING TESTED

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:05.300
THEN WHEN THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:07.302
TEST NON RODENT SPECIES.

01:25:07.368 --> 01:25:09.838
VARIOUS OTHER SPECIES NO I NOW

01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:12.674
IRIS VERY VERIFY MAY I MEAN

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.509
LIKE I'M OKAY WITH FERRIS BUT

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:16.611
JUST JOKING JUST JOKING PLEASE

01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:17.111
DON'T EMAIL ME ABOUT THE

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:19.848
PARENTS. WE'VE ALL BEEN DOWN

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:24.352
THAT HOLE. I'M I'M JOKING. NOT

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:25.253
JOKING THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN DOWN

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.789
THAT HOLE- YES I OULD LOVE AN

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:30.124
ANSWER I'M JUST I DON'T KNOW

01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:31.192
ENOUGH ABOUT THIS THAT'S WHY

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:32.760
I'M ASKING BECAUSE I'M TRYING

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:34.329
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE WHAT

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:36.030
WE'RE PUSHING IN THE TESTING

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:38.032
TOWARDS HERE OF COURSE NOT YES

01:25:38.099 --> 01:25:39.033
WE ARE THERE'S REQUIRE WE ARE

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.301
ADVOCATING FOR NON ANIMAL

01:25:40.368 --> 01:25:41.269
METHODS TO BE WHAT IT'S

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:42.904
WHATEVER RIGHT OFF THE WALL-

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.372
OTHER SPECIES ARE FAIR IT'S

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:46.374
PRIMATES OTHER CURRENT VIRUS

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:48.710
ARE FAIR AT SOME PRIMATES BEING

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:50.979
USED RIGHT NOW. IT IS. ONE OF

01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:52.580
THE REASON THE ANIMAL YOU. AND

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:54.249
WE USE NUMBERS FOR DOGS IS SO

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.850
LOW IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:56.951
OTHER MODELS THAT ARE SO

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:58.620
SPECIFICALLY. DESIGNED FOR EACH

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:00.054
DISEASE THAT WE RESEARCH FOR

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:01.990
INSTANCE IF YOU'RE STUDYING A

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:03.625
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ELECTRIC

01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:04.926
EELS OF THE MODEL OF CHOICE OF

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:05.960
YOUR STUDYING. FOR INSTANCE

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:07.495
LEPROSY ARMADILLOS AND MODEL

01:26:07.562 --> 01:26:09.831
CHOICE AND SO. CANINES OF THE

01:26:09.898 --> 01:26:10.698
MODEL OF CHOICE FOR VERY

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:11.966
SPECIFIC PORTION OF DISEASE

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:13.334
RESEARCH AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:15.036
WE MIGHT NEED TO DO. CERTAINLY

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:16.704
WE'RE NOT GOING TO. DEVELOP A

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:18.740
DRUG FOR I DON'T KNOW BREAST

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:19.941
CANCER AND USE IT AND DODD

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:21.209
RESEARCH A MAN AND YOU STOCKS

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:22.277
OF THE MODEL JUST. NOT THE

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:24.479
CORRECT MODEL TO DO THAT. AND I

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:25.947
DO WHAT THE FLICK TO SNEAK IN

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:27.282
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT

01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:29.484
THE NUMBER THAT. OF THE AUTHOR

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:31.152
MENTION THAT FIVE THOUSAND DOGS

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:32.353
WERE USED IN BIOMEDICAL

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:33.187
RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA I'M

01:26:33.254 --> 01:26:35.390
SORRY THIS IS NOT THE

01:26:35.456 --> 01:26:38.192
OPPORTUNITY TO VEER OFF OF THE

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:39.427
QUESTIONS ASKED. THANK YOU.

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:42.497
THANK YOU. OKAY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:45.833
COMMENTS GALLAGHER. YES SO I

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.702
THINK I'M I'M INCLINED TO

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:49.170
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- I THINK

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:52.407
THE- YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:54.175
THERE'S A PRACTICALITY ARGUMENT

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:55.677
HERE AND THEN AND THEN THERE'S

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:57.045
KIND OF A MORAL ARGUMENT IN THE

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:59.280
PRACTICALITY IS IT APPEARS FROM

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:01.082
SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT DOGS

01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.816
AREN'T ALWAYS A VERY GOOD

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:04.218
INDICATOR OF. WHAT IS TOXIC

01:27:04.285 --> 01:27:05.687
TOWARDS HUMANS SAID OR AT LEAST

01:27:05.753 --> 01:27:06.421
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF VERY

01:27:06.487 --> 01:27:08.957
ABILITY AND SO WE'RE KINDA

01:27:09.023 --> 01:27:10.959
SAYING LOOK WHY USE AN ANIMAL

01:27:11.025 --> 01:27:12.994
THAT'S NOT VERY INDICATIVE OF

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:15.897
TOXICITY RIGHT- AND I THINK

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:18.166
THAT'S KIND OF. A BIG REASON

01:27:18.232 --> 01:27:19.701
FOR MY SPORT BUT I THINK WHAT

01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:21.536
WE'VE BEEN GETTING THAT. IN

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:23.771
SOME OF THIS DISCUSSION. IT

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:24.939
SEEMS LIKE WE ARE SAYING WE'RE

01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:27.308
OKAY WITH DOING TESTING. AND

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:29.644
BECAUSE WHAT'S BECAUSE THE

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:31.112
IMPLICATION HERE IS THAT WE'RE

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:32.113
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.648
DON'T HAVE TOXICITY IN HUMANS

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:35.450
WHEN WE USE DIFFERENT DRUGS OR

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:37.485
WHEN WE'RE USING DIFFERENT. AND

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:39.654
THE IDEA IS TO PROTECT. YOUR

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.923
HUMAN LIFE AND- IN ORDER TO DO

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:43.324
THAT YOU HAVE TO DO SOME KIND

01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:47.261
OF TESTING TO SEE IF THERE'S-

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:48.630
GONNA BE TOXICITY AND IT'S

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:50.898
GOING TO BE HARMFUL TO HUMANS

01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:52.266
RIGHT SO IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE

01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:55.103
WERE AS SOCIETY EXCEPT IN SOME

01:27:55.169 --> 01:27:57.505
LEVEL OF TESTING. BUT THEN WE

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:58.573
GET INTO LIKE WILL WHICH

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.508
ANIMALS ARE OKAY TO TEST ON

01:28:00.575 --> 01:28:04.545
RAY. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE.

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:05.680
YEAH I GUESS THERE IS A LITTLE

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:06.981
BIT OF A STRUGGLE THERE LIKE

01:28:07.048 --> 01:28:09.183
ARE A RODENT SOMEHOW LESSER

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:13.354
ANIMALS AND OTHERS- I THINK. A

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:14.422
LOT OF US WOULD SAY YES WE LOVE

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:16.124
OUR DOGS AND WE'RE NOT REALLY

01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:17.291
TOO THRILLED ABOUT RATS AND YOU

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:20.361
KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW. BUT AT THE

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:21.663
SAME TIME LIKE YOU SAID I MEAN

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:24.699
THESE ARE ALL LIVING THINGS.

01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:25.600
AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:27.535
WHAT WE HAVE TO KIND OF WHERE

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:29.737
DO WE DRAW THE LINE YEAH WELL

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:32.507
YOU KNOW- IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:34.942
CONVERSATION. AND THE QUESTION

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:36.944
ULTIMATELY IS WHAT'S THE

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:40.148
APPETITE OF THIS BODY OR EVEN

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:42.850
OUR CULTURE TO SAY CAN WE

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.585
CONTINUE SCIENTIFIC TESTING

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:47.555
WITHOUT DOING IT ON. ANIMALS ON

01:28:47.622 --> 01:28:49.023
CREATURES AT ALL I WOULD ARGUE

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:51.659
THAT IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO.

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:53.161
MAKE AN DEVELOP A CAR THAT CAN

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:55.830
DRIVE ITSELF. YOU CAN PROBABLY

01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:57.365
FIND A SCIENTIFIC METHOD THAT

01:28:57.432 --> 01:28:59.567
WILL ALLOW YOU TO TEST TOXICITY

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:00.868
LEVELS AND THE EFFICACY OF A

01:29:00.935 --> 01:29:02.937
DRUG WITHOUT USING A LIVING

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:06.040
BREATHING CREATURE- BUT THAT.

01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:11.179
IS CERTAINLY UP FOR DEBATE. WE

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:12.780
I THINK MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY

01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:15.349
THEY WANT TO MOVE TOWARDS NON

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:17.985
ANIMAL METHODS- YOU KNOW AND

01:29:18.052 --> 01:29:19.887
ONCE AGAIN I THINK. THAT'S A

01:29:19.954 --> 01:29:22.023
QUESTION THAT SPEAKS TO YOU

01:29:22.090 --> 01:29:23.491
KNOW THE COURAGE OF A COMMUNITY

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:24.559
TO SAY HOW DO WE MAKE THIS

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:26.928
HAPPEN THIS IS ABOUT CHANGING A

01:29:26.994 --> 01:29:28.696
BUSINESS MODEL IS IT IS ABOUT

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:32.767
AS YOU. ALSO STATED LOOKING AT-

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:34.936
YOU KNOW HOW PRACTICAL IT IS TO

01:29:35.002 --> 01:29:36.571
DO SO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE

01:29:36.637 --> 01:29:38.106
TESTING FOR EXAMPLE THE TAXES

01:29:38.172 --> 01:29:40.007
THE LEVELS OF ROUNDUP AND

01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:41.509
YOU'RE NOT YOU KNOW BE KILLING

01:29:41.576 --> 01:29:43.878
THE DOG BUT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:45.546
LEGAL TO HUMANS CHANCES ARE

01:29:45.613 --> 01:29:46.914
MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP DOING

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:49.050
THAT KIND OF TEST ON THAT KIND

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:52.019
OF CREATURE- SO I CERTAINLY

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:53.221
DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE TIME

01:29:53.287 --> 01:29:54.922
TO GET INTO THOSE KINDS OF.

01:29:54.989 --> 01:29:56.424
EXISTENTIALIST SHINS BUT I

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:57.625
CERTAINLY WOULD HOPE THAT THERE

01:29:57.692 --> 01:29:59.026
WOULD BE AN APPETITE AT SOME

01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:00.428
POINT TO SAY HOW DO WE

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:01.262
ENCOURAGE THIS KIND OF

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:04.632
SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT TO ALLOW

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:05.266
US TO DO THESE KINDS OF STUDIES

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:07.368
WITHOUT HARMING ANIMALS. ANY

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:08.870
KIND OF. YOU KNOW AND HOW COME

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:09.804

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:12.907
OF ANIMALS THAT ARE BEING

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:14.308
TESTED HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:15.643
HOW MANY OF THEM DO GET ADOPTED

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.078
AND HOW MANY OF THEM STAY ALIVE

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:18.613
ONCE THEY ARE ADOPTED IN WHAT

01:30:18.679 --> 01:30:21.282

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:24.652
