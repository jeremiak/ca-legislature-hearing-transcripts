AND WITH THAT. SENATOR WINNER WHEN YOU'RE READY. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER. OUT WORKING WITH US ON S. B. IT -- TWENTY EIGHT AND I DO -- EXCEPT THE COMMITTEES ARE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT TO THE BILL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT -- SP TWENTY A I WILL STRENGTHEN -- THERE GREEN ARE THE REASON A HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT -- TO MAKE IT -- A MORE POWERFUL TOOL OPETH STATE TO ENFORCE OUR HOUSING LAWS AND FAIR SHARE. OUR PRINCIPLES -- AS YOU KNOW. THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOMES WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE HOUSING DEFICIT IN THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES -- COMBINED -- THIS DEFICIT IS AT ALL INCOME LEVELS IS A MARKET RATE AND IT IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE AT LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME. A LEVELS WHERE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT BEING PUSHED IN THE HOMELESSNESS WORKING FAMILIES WHO WERE FORCED TO COMMUTE HOURS AND HOURS TO WORKING PEOPLE. WHO ARE LEAVING THE STATE ENTIRELY AND CHILDREN WHO GO TO COLLEGE AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE BACK IN THE TOWN WHERE THEY? GREW UP AND LET'S HAVE THAT IN THEIR PARENTS BASEMENT SO THIS IS AN EXTREME ISSUE THAT. HARMS OUR ECONOMY OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR STATE'S DIVERSITY -- OUR HEALTH OUR QUALITY OF LIFE -- AND STRENGTHENING RENA THIS ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES ARE ARE. CREATING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF HOUSING -- THAT IT'S EQUITABLE -- AND THAT -- HEALTH IN ALL INCOME LEVELS IS BEING ZONED FOR AND ONLY A MOVE FORWARD S. B. THIRTY FIVE LAST YEAR THAT WAS BY THE ONE THING THAT EVERYONE AGREED ON THAT RENO NEEDED A LOT OF HELP -- AND THERE ARE SOME EXTREME DISPARITIES ON FOR EXAMPLE -- IN -- LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- REDONDO BEACH WAS ALLOCATED ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED UNITS OF HOUSING OVER NEED YOUR ARENA CYCLE ITS NEIGHBORS. SIMILAR POPULATION HERMOSA BEACH MANHATTAN BEACH -- WERE AYE RESPECTIVELY ALLOCATED TO UNITS AND THIRTY SEVEN UNITS BEVERLY HILLS WAS ALLOCATED TO UNITS OVER AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD -- IT SO I DID SOMETHING WRONG. I'M SB. TWENTY EIGHT ON THOSE A FEW THINGS ON PURPOSE TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE TO A CD. ON HOW TO CALCULATE BUT BACKLOG OF EXISTING HOUSING NEED REASON BY REASON BY INTEGRATING DATA ABOUT THEY CAN SEE RAY OVERCROWDING AND HOUSING COSTS BURDEN. SO WE CAN START DIGGING OUT OF A MASSIVE DEFICIT WE FACE I ALSO [inaudible] REQUIRES COMMUNITIES AS PART OF THE RINA AND HOUSING ON THE PROCESS. I TWO ZONE FOR ONE HUNDRED AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT OF HITTING A 100%. I WE STARTED OUT OF THE BILL THE CHALLENGES THATIF A COMMUNITY IS JONES FOR EXACTLY THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY OF THE PROJECT. X. Y. Z. PROJECT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN OR MIGHT BE DELAYED OR MIGHT END UP PRODUCING FEWER UNITS AND AND THAT ITS OWN. FOR AYE SO YOU'RE SETTING YOURSELF UP NEVER TO HIT A 100% AYE IF YOU ONLY ZONE FOR HUNTER PRESENTS A ONE TWENTY FIVE WILL LEAST -- GIVE US A SHOT AT HITTING 100% -- AND THEN -- IN TERMS OF IF GROWTH IN PAINFUL AREA SO IT REQUIRES ON THE COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS OUGHT TO FOCUS ON ON GROWTH AND HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS WITH THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. A LOT OF THE BILL ALSO EXCEPT TO GUARD RAILS -- AROUND WHEN THE STATE ALLOCATES TO EACH REGION THIS IS HOW MANY UNITS YOUR REGION IS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A RIGHT NOW IT BECOMES A POLITICAL FOOD FIGHT IN TERMS OF HOW. THOSE NUMBERS ARE DISTRIBUTED WITH AND THE REASON TO INDIVIDUAL CITIES THAT'S HOW WE END UP WITH SOME OF THESE DISPARITIES. OF THE BILL WILL REQUIRE A MUCH MORE -- DATA DRIVEN APPROACH IN TERMS OF THOSE INTERNAL REGIONAL -- ALLOCATIONS OF HOUSING GOING TO THANK THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP BAY AREA COUNCIL FOR CO SPONSORING THE BILL -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY ARE MICHAEL LANE FROM THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND LESS SHEPHERD FROM SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS HAVE BLACK SHEPHERD REPRESENTING THAT SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP. THE LEADERSHIP GROUP JOINTLY RELEASED A REPORT CALLED THE SILICON VALLEY COMPETITIVENESS AND INNOVATION PROJECT THAT LOOKS AT THE EFFECTS OF HOUSING CRISIS THE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR REGION. THE REPORT FOUND THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TEN IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE SILICON VALLEY HAD A NEW JOB GROWTH AT WHILE ONLY HAVING NEW HOUSING GROWTH OF 4%. COLLECTIVELY LEADERSHIP GROUP MEMBERS PROVIDE NEARLY ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS IN THE SILICON VALLEY. AND EVERY CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD WITH OUR SOUL SEC IF WE HEAR ABOUT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AS THE NUMBER ONE THREAT TO OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH. OUR COMPANIES ARE STRUGGLING TO ATTRACT AND KEEP EMPLOYEES AT ALL LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE COST OF HOUSING. SB EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT IS IN LINE WITH LONGTIME LAND USE PRINCIPLES OF THE LEADERSHIP GROUP TO INCREASE HOUSING SUPPLY AND ENSURE THAT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE DOING THEIR NECESSARY FAIR SHARE. OF BUILDING NEW HOUSING SB EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT IS THE FIRST STEP IN GETTING TO MORE EFFECTIVE RINA PROCESS AND IT'S CRITICAL TO ADDRESS OUR STATE'S WORSENING HOUSING CRISIS. WE THANK YOU AND WE ARE TRITE BUT CHURCHILL AND MEMBERS MICHAEL AND WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE RINA REFORM AND MODERNIZATION THAT S. B. I. TWENTY EIGHT REPRESENTS. THE SCARCITY OF PROPERTIES OWNED MULTI FAMILY SITES OUR COMPETITIVE PER STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE PROGRAM IS A REAL PROBLEM. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT ADDRESSES BY REQUIRING THE JURISDICTIONS OWN FOR MORE SUCH SITES. THIS REPORTEDLY SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON SKYROCKETING LAMB PRICES AND ENSURE SUFFICIENT PARCELS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT% THE BAY AREA WERE LACKING GO FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS PER ACRE MORE MORE. THERE ARE THREE INGREDIENTS NEEDED TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING LAND TO FUNDING AND POLITICAL WILL TO GET PROJECTS APPROVED. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF LAND IN ITS AVAILABILITY AND VIABILITY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THE METHODOLOGY CALLED FOR AN SBA TWENTY EIGHT TO ASSESS AND ALLOCATE THE TRUE HOUSING NEED WILL PROVIDE BOTH GREATER ACCURACY. AND EQUITY IN THOSE RINA NUMBERS AND FAIR SHARE [inaudible] DISTRIBUTION. CREATING A BUFFER BY SELLING FOR MORE THAN JUST 1100% OF THE ALLOCATION IS IT IS A BEST PRACTICE THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS ALREADY USE BUT MORE NEED TO DO THIS IN THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT WE THINK THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND FOR THESE REASONS REAP RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GOT OTHER SUPPORT IS A LIKE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY. CHIU HERE CHIU HERE MAIENSCHEIN. CHAO. CHOI HERE SHOW HERE GLORIA GLORY HERE ONLY MONTH. AND AMONG HERE WOULD WOULD BE HERE WE HAVE A QUORUM WITH THAT LET'S GO TO OTHER SUPPORTERS NAME AND TITLE PLACE THANK YOU. JENNIFER SPENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT. THINGS CHAIR KEEFE THEN ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING SYLVIA OFFERING TO HAVE A FACEBOOK IN SUPPORT. KEVIN ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. MORNING ASSISTANCE AND I'M HALF CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN SPORT. MONETARY MEMBERS THIS FRONT AND BE HAPPY CALIFORNIA VIA TRANSPORT. AND A MUSICIAN WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS A CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT. CORNELIUS BROKE THE BEAR COUNCIL SUPPORT. TIFFANY FAN OF HOW THE BRIDGE HOUSING IN SUPPORT. PLAY SHEPHERD AGAIN FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. AND LET ME NOW ASK IF THERE ARE ANY. FOLKS IN OPPOSITION. CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT FIRST THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY SEVERAL PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THAT WE SUPPORT AND SEE TAX SUPPORTS. LOOKING AT THE RENO PROCESS AND PUTTING SOME GUARDRAILS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALLOCATING THE HOUSING PLANNING AND REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE JOBS AND TRANSIT AND OVERCROWDING AND UNMET DEMAND. AND SO WE THINK THE SECTIONS OF THIS BILL FOR FIVE OR SORRY FIVE AND SIX BETTER RELATED TO THAT PROCESS AND IMPROVING NOT PROCESS ARE LEGITIMATE AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION IF THAT WERE ALL THAT THE BILL THAT. THE PARTS OF THE BILL THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOWEVER DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RINA ALLOCATION OR ASSESSMENT PROCESS BUT RATHER WITH THE HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO FOR INSTANCE SECTION ONE A REQUIREMENT THAT IF YOU CAN'T HIT ALL OF YOUR ADEQUATE SITES IN TERMS OF LAND THAT'S ALREADY ZONED FOR HOUSING. IT PUTS FURTHER RESTRICTIONS BEYOND WHAT'S ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT LAW ON WHERE THAT LEE AND THAT CAN BE DEDICATED FOR HOUSING HOUSE TO BE LOCATED. SO CURRENTLY THE DEFINITION THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE BILL IS LITERALLY UNWORKABLE FOR COUNTIES AND WHILE WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE ABOUT POTENTIALLY INCLUDING OTHER. AND LIMITATIONS ARE PEOPLE ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET THE ADEQUATE SITES UNDER THE THRESHOLDS FROM THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN LAST YEAR. AND THEN BEING PUT IN A BOX IN TERMS OF ALSO NOT HAVING ENOUGH SITES FOR WHERE THEY CAN REZONE IT ALSO MEET THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS. I AM FOR SECTION TWO AND THREE WHICH IS THE REQUIREMENT TO ZONE FOR A 125% OF YOUR ADEQUATE SITES AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED WITH THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN AND ONE SIXTY SIX LAST YEAR. WHICH BOTH ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND WHICH REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET BECAUSE FOLKS HAVEN'T DONE THEIR FIRST HOUSING ELEMENTS UNDER THOSE NEW STANDARDS. SO THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN INSURES THAT THE SITES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE INVENTORY ARE THE MOST EASILY DEVELOP ALL POLL SITES AND SO THEY'RE GOOD SITES AN SP ONE SIXTY SIX REQUIRES THAT THERE ALWAYS BE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF SITES. TO MEET YOUR REMAINING THAT RINA ALLOCATION SO WE DID A NEW THRESHOLD THAT SAYS THE SITE HAVE TO BE EASY TO DEVELOP AND WE ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH SITE SO WE THINK WE'VE ALREADY FIX THIS PROBLEM. AS RELATED TO RUNNING OUT OF ADEQUATE SITES DURING THE PLANNING PERIOD WITH LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATION AND WE DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ADD A NEW THRESHOLD AND AND REQUIRE -- THAT HUNDRED AND 25% A LEVEL FINALLY WITH AND SECTION FOUR OF THE BILL WE ARE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THIS LANGUAGE IT'S KIND OF LIKE STATUTORY INTENT LANGUAGE. BUT IT DESCRIBES WHAT RINA REALLY IS AND SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED WITH STRIKING THE LANGUAGE THAT REALLY DOES RECOGNIZE THAT DESPITE ALL THE BEST EFFORTS OF CITIES AND COUNTIES SOMETIMES DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE OF THE MARKET BECAUSE OF WHATEVER. DOESN'T MEET THOSE THRESHOLDS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO REVISE THAT LANGUAGE TO AT LEAST. MAINTAINED SOME RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S PARTS OF THE MARKET THAT ARE JUST BEYOND GOVERNMENT CONTROL AND SO WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS WILL BE ABLE TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION BUT FOR NOW WE ARE OPPOSE LET'S AMENDED THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING BILL HIGGINS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE BEEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION BUT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKE AND RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THAT THE STATEWIDE FACTORS. WERE THE THING THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS WITH OUR SMALLER COGS BECAUSE IT WAS PROBABLY INFLUENCE WITH YOUR WORK WITH ONE OF OUR LARGER MEMBERS. AND SO WE'RE JUST MAKING SURE THAT IT WORKS ACROSS THE BOARD. BUT THE SECOND THING AND I IS THAT WE HAVE THIS COMMITTEE PISSED UP PASSED OUT A BILL AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE BLOOM. THAT DEALS WITH SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES. AND WE CAN'T REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION UNTIL THOSE TWO ARE IN SYNC BECAUSE THAT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE APPROACHING THE SAME PROBLEM AND DIFFERENT WAYS AND WE ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO GET IN THE SAME ROOM AND TALK ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO BILLS AT THE END OF THE THE THING THEN THE LAST ISSUE. IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE DO NEED TO WORK ON ALL TOGETHER. BECAUSE THIS IS ASKING OUR MEMBERS TO DISTRIBUTE HOUSING UNITS ON A FAIR SHARE PRINCIPLE. AND THAT WILL RESULT IN A VERY DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTION VAN WHAT YOU ANOTHER LAWS YOU WE HAVE ITS S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE THAT SAYS WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. A DISTRIBUTION THAT REDUCES GHG S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE TARGETS. AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION THAT IF THIS BILL PASSED RIGHT NOW. WE WOULD BE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A ARE BE PUSHING US ON ONE LEVEL. TO GET ONE RESULT AND H. CD DOING A DIFFERENT WE NEED THE STATE TO WORK TOGETHER ON THOSE TWO ISSUES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM IT'S GREAT TO WORK WITH US ON THAT YOU'VE NODDED YOUR HEAD YES AT LEAST LAST TIME I TOUCHED BY THIS I'M HOPING WE CAN WORK THAT ISSUE OUT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER. TO MAKE SURE THE STATE SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE. THE MASS FOR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN OPPOSITION MR OF MR MEMBERS USE RIGHTLY CALIFORNIA CITIES AND WE HAVEN'T WAS LESS SIMILAR POSITIONS WELL WE SHARE MANY OF THE THE COMMENTS THAT I SEE SEC MATE. WE APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK WITH US WITH GOING BACK AND FORTH AS A STAFF WERE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET THERE -- BUT FOR NOW WE HAVEN'T BUSINESSMAN POSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN EVER DAVID JONES BEHALF OF SAN MARCOS IN THE CITIES IN MARIN COUNTY IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR ALICE KESSLER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LONG BEACH AND RESPECTFULLY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. KELLY BUCKS ON BEHALF OF THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND OF THE SAME CONCERNS AS HE'S ACTING CAM. ANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ALAMY ELSA CENTER IF YOU WANNA RESPOND TO YOUR OPPOSITION PROPER THROW WE HAVE BEEN WORKING -- HARD WITH LITTLE WITH THE LEAGUE WITH C. SAP WITH CAL BECAUSE WE MADE. AMENDMENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK OUT WITH THAT DEFINITION OF INFILL OR ANY OF THESE OTHER ISSUES ARE -- AND AND BY IN TERMS OF THE INTENT LANGUAGE THAT'S YOU SUCK ON MENTIONED WERE ALREADY WORKING I BELIEVE WITH THE LEAGUE ON THAT SO. OR MAYBE WITH CALCOT ACCOUNT NUMBER BUT I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK OF WITH ALL OF THEM -- I'M WE WILL DEFINITELY BRING COMMUNICATION WITH THE SPONSORS OF THE BLOOM READ A BILL WE OBVIOUSLY WANT THEM TO BE COMPLEMENTARY AND FOR ALL I THINK ALL. ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE. I THOUGHT THAT THAT HAPPENS -- BUT I I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL AN IMPORTANT STOP AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND DAD JUST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE APPRECIATE YOUR ADVOCACY OVER -- HOUSING AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT THAT RENA IT HAS BEEN IN NEED OF REFORM IT HAS NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO. I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS THAT OUR COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED -- AND SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS TO PUSH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO UP BILL MORE HOUSING SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY LET ME ASK IF THERE OTHER COMMENTS. MISTER GLORIA DAVID CHAIRMAN AND SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL I'M I'M CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF IT I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO MAYBE EXPAND IT MORE ON THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE THE THE PUSH AND PULL BETWEEN CAR. AND THE LITTLE BIT THEY SHOULD WE JUST MENTIONED CAN YOU SPEAK MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK. IT WILL HAPPEN TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT ENCOURAGING SPRAWL THAT AND WE THIS IS OUR I THINK A IN HER INTENTION AND HOUSING POLICY IN. CALIFORNIA PA AND EVERYONE'S RIGHT TO DIE WELL ON THE ONE HAND [inaudible] WE WANT. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT WHERE WE'RE CONCENTRATING HOUSING. YOU KNOW AROUND TRANSIT AROUND IN JOB CENTERS -- NOT CREATING SPRAWL ON THE OTHER HAND I WE WANT EQUITY SO WE DON'T HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OPTING OUT OF HOUSING THAT ARE SAYING NO LOW INCOME HOUSING HERE -- AND SO FORTH AND WE HAVE TO BALANCE THE TWO WE ARE -- WE HAVE WE HAVE AMENDED THIS IN THE TO TO TRY TO REDRESS BY -- TALK ABOUT CONCENTRATING DEVELOPMENT IN THESE MORE SUSTAINABLE AREAS LIKE AROUND WHICH HAS TO SHOULD BE DIFFICULT LANGUAGE AND TO THAT EFFECT. I AND YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT -- IT IS IMPORTANT BUT ISN'T EXCEPTIONALLY HARD BALANCE TO STRIKE AND LIKE I SAID ACT ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT ARGUMENT EVERYONE'S RIGHT -- AND SO WHAT WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO STRIKE A BALANCE WELL APPRECIATED PERSISTENCE IN THE IT ATTEMPTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FUNDAMENTALLY GET MORE HOUSING BUILT WHICH IS ULTIMATELY I THINK THIS BILL IS TO DELIVER ENDEAVORING TO DO -- ENDS YOU KNOW IT IS WHO RENTS ARE TOO HIGH HOUSING IS TO ON AFFORDABLE I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DON'T VOTE FOR AN EFFORT THAT TRIES TO MOVE THIS FORWARD SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING FORWARD IT IS DIFFICULT. AND YOU MAY KNOW MY OWN COUNTY WE CAN STRUGGLING WITH THE DESIRED OF LOWER -- THEIR MEAN A STANDARD THINK WE'VE SUCCESS COULD NOT THAT THAT -- THIS BILL I THINK ONLY A STICKS IN THE FURTHER IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO WE APPRECIATE THE PERSISTENCE OF HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. IT'S BEEN A MOTION OF THE BILLS ARE SECOND THEIR SECOND THAT ANY FURTHER COMMENTS CENTER ANY CLOSING COMMENTS RESPECT WITH LENOVO. WITH THAT OF MADAM SECRETARY. MOTION TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CHIU AYE CHIU AYE MAIENSCHEIN CHAO. CHAU AYE. CHOI [inaudible] GLORIA. GLORIA AYE LIMA [inaudible] WOULD [inaudible] WAIT I YOU EFFORT VOTES YOUR BILL IT WILL BE OUT BUT WILL WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL ANALYST YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU COLLEAGUES MEGACENTRE [inaudible] CENTER BATES. WILL BE. CONSIDERING FILE ITEM THREE SB TWELVE TWENTY SIX SENATOR WELCOME. WELL GOOD MORNING ON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AYE AYE AGAIN WE HAVE -- BEFORE YOU A BILL THAT SEEKS TO ADDRESS FIVE THEY HOUSING ISSUES. ARE S. B. R. TWELVE TWENTY SIX DIRECTS THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION TO ADOPTED BUILDING STANDARD. THAT WOULD CLARIFY THE AUTHORITY FOR A LOCAL BUILDING OFFICIAL TO PERMIT AN EXISTING RESIDENTIAL UNIT. LEASE ON THE DATE OF CONSTRUCTION CURRENT STATUTE DELEGATES LOCAL BUILDING OFFICIALS WITH THE AUTHORITY TO APPLY THE CURRENT PROVISIONS OF THE BUILDING STANDARDS CODE. BUT CURRENT LAW IS UNCLEAR ABOUT A LOCAL BUILDING OFFICIALS ABILITY TO GO BACK IN THE CODE TO PERMIT THESE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. THE BILL SEEKS TO MAKE IT CLEAR AND TO CLARIFY EXISTING PRACTICE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE THESE ON PERMITTED EXISTING RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ARE. BRING THEM UP TO A SUITABLE LEVEL IN THE CODE WHICH ENSURES BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. THE BILL WAS APPROVED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS AS IT I WENT THROUGH THE SENATE AND RECEIVED NO NO VOTES IN COMMITTEE I HAVE A TO HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TODAY MAYOR CATHERINE BLACKS FEAR. AND JONATHAN I'M MAYOR CATHERINE LAXER OF ANTHONY DESK IN MY DISTRICT AND JONATHAN CLAY WHO'S HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BOTH ARE WITH THE CITY OF ENCINITAS. CATHERINE FOR GOVERNING GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M CATHOLIC SPARE THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF ENCINITAS AND I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE AS THE SPONSORING CITY FOR SP TWELVE TWENTY SIX AUTHORED BY OUR STATE SENATOR PAT BATES THANK YOU. OTHER CURRENTLY WE ESTIMATE THAT IN THE CITY OF ENCINITAS THERE ARE AT LEAST A THOUSAND ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS THAT ARE ON PERMITTED. BUT ARE A VITAL PART OF OUR EXISTING HOUSING STOCK AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALSO IN THIS POSITION. MANY OF THE OWNERS OF THESE UNITS LIVE IN THE SHADOWS AND THEY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE THAT THEIR NEIGHBOR COULD TURN THE MEN WITH ONE PHONE CALL. BUT THEY'RE ALSO UNABLE TO PERMIT THE UNIT BASED ON IN FEASIBILITY OR PROHIBITIVELY HIGH COST. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES S. B. TOLD TWENTY SIX IS THAT CLARIFIES THAT A LOCAL BUILDING OFFICIAL HAS THE AUTHORITY TO PERMIT THESE ALREADY OCCUPIED HOMES. BASED ON THE BUILDING STANDARD THAT WAS IN A FACT WHEN THE UNIT WAS CONSTRUCTED. I'VE HEARD FROM RESIDENTS THAT THEY'RE VERY OLD ACCESSORY UNITS SOME OF THEM ARE MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD PRE DATING OUR CITIES AND CORPORATION. ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PERMIT UNDER OUR CURRENT CODES. AND SO THEIR ONLY OPTION WOULD BE REMOVAL OF THIS YEAR THESE UNITS WHICH IS NOT IDEAL FOR THEM AS THE LANDOWNER OR FOR THE CITY AND THE STATE AND A HOUSING CRISIS. SO AS A GOVERNMENT WORK CONCERNED ABOUT MAINTAINING IN CREATING A SAFE HOUSING STOCK. AND WERE ALSO TRYING TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSING IN OUR CITY NOT LESS. SO THIS BILL WILL LEAD TO MORE PERMITTED HOMES AND THEREFORE AN INCREASE IN SAFE HOMES AND WE APPRECIATE SENATOR BATES AUTHORING THIS BILL FOR US AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING -- I ME KATIE ALMOND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS TODAY. AND I WANT TO SPEAK AS TO THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT ACTUALLY HELP DEVELOP THESE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODES AND ENFORCE THEM ON A DAILY BASIS. BUILDING OFFICIALS CURRENTLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PERMIT STRUCTURES ARE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND THEREFORE PLACING THIS DUPLICATIVE LANGUAGE IN STATUTE -- WOULD ONLY A INTERFERE WITH THE CONSISTENCY OF REGULATORY CODE. AS PART OF CALVET SIX POINT POLICY A WE DO NOT SUPPORT COULD IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS RATHER THE REGULATORY PROCESS FOR THE CONSISTENCY AND ACCURACY. BY THIS PART OF THE AUTHORITY -- TO PERMIT THE STRUCTURES ALREADY IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN IBC I RC IN THE EPC BUILDING CODES. CALVO SUPPORTS IMPLEMENTATION OF LOCAL ORDINANCES WHICH ALLOW FOR THE AT ADAPTATION AND ACCOUNT FOR THE DIVERSE REGIONS OF OUR STATE. COUPLE WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE TRAINING ASPECT AND NOT LEGISLATIVE CODE IMPLEMENTATION. PLACING THIS ENFORCEMENT IN STATUTE DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. AGAIN THE CITIES AND THE POPULATIONS THAT THESE EIGHTY USE RESIDE IN CALPERS SUPPORTS LOCALITIES A DEVELOPING THESE ORDINANCES AND WHEN IT TURNED OUT SUPPORT THESE LOCAL NEEDS THANK YOU. LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY. OTHER INDIVIDUALS WILL LIKE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. OKAY BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. MISTER GORE. ITEMS SHARE AND THAT NEAR IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU OUTLOOK SENIOR UP -- I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD THIS FROM CONSTITUENTS IN MY MIND AND THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE BUT WE ARE STUCK WITH THAT I HEARD THE COMMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION I THINK ONE AND MAYBE THIS IS FOR A FOR YOU -- I THINK A PART OF THIS BILL IS CLEAR FINE WHEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE. TO BRING IT UP TO RIGHT I THINK MOST THAT MAY LEAST MY SPIRITS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEY'D THE EXISTING RADIO OWNER WOULD HAVE TO BRING IT UP CURRENT CODE. AS OPPOSED TO NINETEEN SEVENTY NINETEEN EIGHTY WHATEVER BECAUSE GOD NO PLEASE UM THEY CAN ACTUALLY PERMIT ON A P. CASE BY CASE BASIS CURRENTLY AND APPLY WHAT THEY FEEL IN THEIR OPINION IN THEIR AUTHORITY APPLIES TO THE EIGHTY OR SO. AS LONG AS SAFETY AND HEALTH MEASURES ARE MET THEY CAN GO BACKWARDS AS LONG AS THEY THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TIME. IT'S VERY SUBJECTIVE ALRIGHT. AGAIN IT'S THEIR AUTHORITIES YEAH SO IT'S IN THEIR EXPERTISE MA'AM SYMPATHETIC TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN TERMS OF WHAT WE PUT INTO THE TO THE CODE OF WHAT WE DON'T HARM BUT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH ALL RESPECT TO OUR LOCALS YOU KNOW IS REALLY MAKING SURE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO BRING. UP TO ACTUALLY FACILITATE AND THIS IS A EIGHTIES ARE NOT A PANACEA AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE OUR HOUSING CRISIS HOWEVER -- THESE ARE UNITS FOR WHICH PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT AS THEY WERE SAYING -- HAVING THEM ATTENDED TO CODE COMPLIANCE VETERAN BASICALLY FINANCIALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING TO CODE AND THEN THE UNIT JUST COMES OFF THE THE INVENTORY THINK THAT'S WHAT. THE THE AUTHOR THAT CITY BATES TRYING TO DEAL WITH CRAP -- SO I'D THAT SUBJECTIVITY I THINK YOU MAY HAVE SOME JURISDICTIONS WITH A BILL IN OFFICIALS WILL PROBABLY. APPROACH WITH MORE CAN DO CUSTOMER SERVICE ATTITUDE IN RIGHT I'M DEPEND ON THEIR THEIR VIEW ON EIGHTY IS AYE I THINK THAT'S THE VALUE OF THIS BILL -- AND SILLY NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE SOME OF ITS HOUSING IS BROUGHT UP FROM WHATEVER CURRENT STANDARDS THAT MAY BE. HOMEOWNER MAY WANNA MAKE AN IMPROVEMENT BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HELP CONVERT PERMITS FOR IT IF IT'S ON PERMITTED IN THE FIRST PLACE CRACK RIGHT. SO THAT WE TO THE ONE QUESTION I HAD A ONE MAYBE OF AS AS LOOKING AT THE BILL -- CONCERN IS THEORETICALLY IF THERE ARE IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE THAT MAY REQUIRE RELOCATION. OF THE EXISTING TENET AND THE BILL DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK TO WHAT HAPPENS THAT TENET IF AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS I REALIZE THAT THAN THAT ADJUSTMENTS COULD BE FAIRLY MINOR THAT COULD BE FAIRLY MAJOR -- IF IF GIVING A A PROPERTY OWNER WHO THEORETICALLY MAYBE DIDN'T QUITE FOLLOW RULES OF WHEN THIS WAS CREATED -- I'M I'M A LITTLE HESITANT ABOUT PUTTING THAT BURDEN ON THE ON A TENANT WHO. MAYBE IF THE FED COMFORTABLE LIFE -- BUT MAY SUDDENLY BE DISRUPTED BECAUSE WE GRANTED THIS AUTHORITY CAN YOU SPEAK. TO I SENATORS FOR YOU AS THE AUTHOR -- WHAT YOUR VIEW IS ON ON WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO THE TENANTS THAT ARE IN THESE UNITS THAT'S INTERESTING YOU BRING THAT FORWARD TO THE SONY MEN ARE GLORIA BECAUSE? SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN WE INCORPORATED IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY THE CITY OF LAGUNA BEACH SOUTH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES. WHAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS SAW CERTAINLY WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL THE FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO BE ENFORCED WHATEVER? YOU KNOW I WE HAVE BEEN IN AN INDIVIDUAL YOU THOSE UNITS AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A RELOCATION PROBLEMS. FOUND THE CITY ACTUALLY TOOK THAT ON AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE CERTAINLY SOMETHING -- THAT WOULD LIVE WOULD BE LOOKED AT IN A DISCRETIONARY FASHION BUT OTHER THAN THAT I NEED TO GET ON SO THE CITY RELOCATED YEAH WELL THEY HAD THE DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OF VOUCHERS -- FOR YOU KNOW HOTELS Y. AT THAT TIME AND WE'RE TALKING. TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO I THINK THIRTY YEARS AGO -- WHEN ALL THAT HAPPENED AND IT WAS SPREE MOB PRETTY MAJOR AT THAT TIME? THAT I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT IN TERMS OF HOW MANY AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM WOULD BE AN ESPECIALLY WITH SENIORS. THAT CAN BE A REAL ISSUE BUT CHAO SOMETHING THAT I THINK GOES BACK TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT DISCRETION AND CERTAINLY THE WAY THEY LOOK AT TAKING CARE OF THEIR THEIR RESIDENTS. WHO MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES IN THAT DIFFICULT POSITION? WHY WOULD YOU SAY HE THERE'S THERE'S VALUE CAN CONVEY TO THE PROPERTY ON RIGHT BY THE OUT OF BRING SOMETHING INTO COMPLIANCE MAKE IT LEGAL IMPROVE THEIR PROPERTY VALUE THEY -- IT'S ALL UPSIDE FOR THE FOR THE PROPERTY OWNER. I'M OFTEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE TENANT INVOLVED IN I'D YOU KNOW I'M I REALIZE IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF MISSILE BEFORE US TODAY AND CERTAINLY YOUR BILL TO DO WITH WHAT YOU AS YOU SEE FIT PASS MAYBE GONNA GO FOR BASIS TO GIVE SOME CONSIDERATION. TO WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE FOR THE TENANTS. WHO THEORETICALLY WILL GET NO UPSIDE TYPICALLY IF HAVE TO BE RELOCATED AND? I'M ANYONE IS OUT ON THAT ON THE MIDDLE MARKET RIGHT NOW COULD I AND IN YOUR QUESTION A LITTLE OR SO. I THINK THE THE MAIN BENEFIT IS THAT FOR THE TENANTS THAT THEY'RE LIVING IN A PLACE THAT'S ACTUALLY SAFE. SO THERE IS A CONCERN THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN PLACES THAT ARE NOT SAFE AND THEY'RE NOT UP TO FIRE STANDARDS OR OR OTHER STANDARDS. AND AT LEAST FROM MY EXPERIENCE OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME IN AND MEET WITH ME ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS. THEY'D THEY WOULDN'T BE PROACTIVELY KICKING SOMEBODY OUT TO MAKE THESE IMPROVEMENTS WHAT THEY WOULD BE DOING AT THE TIME WHEN IT WOULD NATURALLY TURN OVER WHETHER SOME OTHER TYPE OF REASON THAT THE TENANT MOVES OUT ON THEIR OWN. OR IT INVOLVES A FAMILY MEMBER MULTI GENERATIONAL AND SO IT'S A WAY TO TO TO HELP THAT PROCESS MOVE ALONG AND PROVIDE CLARITY TO THE BUILDING OFFICIAL. BUT ITS I I DON'T SEE THERE AS BEING I'M OF A MAD RUSH TO KICK OUT PEOPLE GET THESE PERMITS COULD I JUST SEE IT AS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM BE PERMITTED BUT I I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE ACTUALLY SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. BUT I I AGREE WITH YOU IT'S A CONCERN -- BUT BUT I I DO I DO THINK THAT IT'S IT'S THE HIGHEST GOOD IS THE SAFETY OF RESIDENTS IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AGREE -- WHAT DE I'VE AND I APPRECIATE THAT INPUT ON THAT -- THIS CHAIR I BELIEVE THIS ENJOYS DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I'M I'M LIVE THAT'S WITH THE RATE THIS MOTION MOVE IT AND A SECOND ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. BUT MR GLORIA THINK CAPTURED MY OWN PERSPECTIVE ON THIS WHICH IS WHILE. NOT THESE RULES ARE IN THE CODE -- THERE CLEARLY ARE SOME A LACK OF CLARITY ARE AS I THINK WE'VE ALL DISCOVERED AND I ALSO DO NOT SEE THE HARM IN IN PUTTING THIS -- INTO STATUTES OF THAT THERE'S SPORTS SO -- THAT'S WHY THIS BILL DOES NOT RECEIVE MY SUPPORT AND WITH THAT ANY FINAL COMMENTS FROM THE CENTER RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BILLION APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. THINK THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WHEN WE SEE WE HAVE THE RENTAL CRISIS GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME THAT. THINK A WITH A HUMANITARIAN APPROACH THAT WE NOW HAVE IN OUR CITIES WITH REGARD SOME HOMELESS FOR ALL THAT. I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING CITIES WOULD TAKE UNDER SERIOUS CONSIDERATION THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO DISPLAY SOME MONEY AND LET'S SAY BANANA UNIT FOR TWENTY YEARS AND YOU KNOW -- ACTUALLY RENTING OR PERHAPS EVEN WHERE THEY HAVE A A RELATIVE SO I THINK THAT CAN BE SOLVED ARE VERY. EASILY MAYBE NOT QUICKLY BUT EASILY I ASK THE COUNCIL'S LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL CASES. WELL THANK YOU GREAT AND WITHOUT OF MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES FORCED TO LIVE IN BUILDINGS THAT WERE NEVER MEANT TO HOUSE PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL EXTENDS RELOCATION BENEFITS TO TENANTS OF I'M PERMITTED SPACES WHEN THEY'RE FORCED TO VACATE DUE TO UNSAFE CONDITIONS. THIS BILL ALSO IMPROVES THE PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING IN FIXING DANGERS BUILDINGS FROM START TO FINISH BY BEEFING UP LOCAL INSPECTIONS ALLOWING LOCAL OFFICIALS TO CHARGE A FEE ALSO TO BE A COVER THOSE INSPECTIONS. IT ALSO ENSURES ACCOUNTABILITY BY REQUIRING REPORTS ON INSPECTIONS ALREADY MANDATED BY LAW. WHEN A DANGEROUS BUILDINGS DISCOVERED SP FOURTEEN FIFTEEN IMPROVES THE TOOLS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE AVAILABLE AND REMOVES OTHER HURDLES TO ENFORCEMENT? ITALSO MAKES IT EASIER FOR TENANTS AND LANDLORDS TO BRING BUILDINGS UP TO CODE BY DIRECTING LOCAL OFFICIALS TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC VIOLATIONS OF BUILDING CODES AND OFFER ADVICE.

AND YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE MISCHIEF THAT WOULD -- BE INVITED IF THE RULES FOR QUALIFICATION OUR ELIGIBILITY TO RUN IS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WERE SUBJECT TO MANIPULATION IN THE WAY THAT THE RULES. CAN BE AND HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST FOR HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS IN FACT -- THERE ARE IN MANY CASES. MANY MORE RULES HIGHER STANDARDS FOR RUNNING. FOR FOR A OF THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION BOARD THAN THERE ARE FOR AS A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY ROOM. SENATE WE THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS ARE. A REALLY ON A GROWING AND PORTENT FORCE IN -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN BECAUSE THEY CALL CARSON OF CLAUSE I GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN MANY WAYS. BOMB AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE BY SENATOR WIECKOWSKI. VITAL TO ENSURING THAT THESE ELECTIONS ARE THE THAT THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS FROM THE BILL OVER APPARENTLY BEING DELETED BECAUSE I THINK THOSE WHO I'M ACTUALLY DID. FIST ARM IN SORT OF ADVANCING THE PRINCIPLES THAT THE BILL SOUGHT TO ENACT ON NEVERTHELESS WE REMAIN SPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER ANY. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT. FEEL FREE TO STEP UP AND HIDE STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. GOOD MORNING MALLORY MICHAEL ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DAVE JONES AND SUPPORT THINK YOU. THERESA BURKE* ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE IT WAS TO OPPOSE THE BILL. ARE YOU A TWEENER [inaudible] AT HOW TO WOULD YOU LIKE TO EXPRESS YOUR PERSPECTIVE. YES I WOULD THINK YOU. ARE I'M AN INDIVIDUAL. WITHIN A HOMEOWNERS I'VE ACTUALLY A COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION ARE YOU AT SUPPORTER OPPOSITE I AM IN SUPPORT RIGHT AND WHAT IS YOUR NAME. MY NAME IS MARTHA AND RATIONAL. ANYWAY FROM ADORAMA I AM FROM THE HISTORIC TOWN OF LOCK CALIFORNIA WHERE I OWN THE PROPERTY [inaudible] AND HI THERE ARE EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS OF THE ELECTION LAWS. THAT HAD BEEN GOING ON SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE WITHIN OUR LITTLE. UP BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT RUNS THE WITH THE COMMUNITY INTEREST DEVELOPMENT THERE -- THAT THE HAVE SELF ELECTED THEIR BOARD SEATS -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE THEY HAVE APPOINTED THEIR GIRLFRIENDS THEIR MORTGAGE SHE'S AND THEIR TENANTS TO THE BOARD AND I HAVE KEPT ALL OTHERS OUT GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU NEED YOUR HELP PAYING VISUAL HERE. TESTIMONY. EXCUSE ME SIR ARE YOU ALSO IN SUPPORT. IF YOU WANT TO JUST STEP TO THE MIKE AND TELL US YOUR NAME AND WHERE YOU'RE FROM THANK YOU I'M FROM BURLINGAME CALIFORNIA I'M A MEMBER OF CCHL. AND I AM SUPPORT OF THIS OF THE BURLINGAME ARE PARK PLAZA TOWERS IS NOT RUN PROP PROPHYLAXIS IN TWELVE YEARS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW TO THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE. HOW WE ARE OPPOSED NOW TO S. B. TWELVE SIXTY FIVE ONE I THINK THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE ANALYSIS AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE SUGGESTED? THEY DO MAKE SOME POSITIVE CHANGES TO THE BILL BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- WERE CONCERNED IT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS ACTUALLY GOING TO INCREASE COSTS FOR ASSOCIATIONS AND ULTIMATELY MORE LIKELY SUPPRESS VOTER A PARTICIPATION. A BECAUSE SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND IT CREATES -- THE FIRST AND FOREMOST ON THE INCREASING OF THE COSTS -- IT SAYS AND THE ONLY WAY THAT A BOARD COULD DISQUALIFY MEMBER. PURSUANT TO THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW IS IF -- THROUGH ITS BYLAWS THE ASSOCIATION I ADDED THIS LANGUAGE WHEN UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S EVEN NECESSARY AS JUST AN UNNEEDED COSTS THAT EVERY ASSOCIATION FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND DO. IN ORDER TO DO A BYLAW AMENDMENT YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE THOSE BY LAW MINUTES DRAFTED MOSTLY BY AN ATTORNEY AND THEN ELECTION HAS TO TAKE PLACE. IF IN FACT THESE ARE GOING TO BE THE REQUIREMENTS THEN WHY NOT JUST MAKE THOSE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND RELIEVE THESE ASSOCIATIONS OF HAVING TO DO THE BYLAWS. WE HAVE SAID ARE ALL ALONG THAT WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER AREAS OF THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED FOR AND THAT ASSOCIATION SHOULD HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY. TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL DISQUALIFICATION. IN THAT AREA WE WOULD BE OPEN TO ALLOWING THAT TO BE DONE BY A BYLAW CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S A HIGHER BAR THERE'S GREATER TRANSPARENCY THERE. THERE ARE ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- SOME BOARDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE THAT SPOUSES CANNOT SERVE ON THE BOARD AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S OTHER CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT MAY OCCUR MAYBE SOMEONE IS AN ACTIVE LITIGATION WITH THE ASSOCIATION. TO CREATE A SIGNIFICANT CONFLICT FOR THEM TO BE ON THE BOARD WE THINK THOSE TYPES OF SITUATION SHOULD BE ALLOWED AT A LOCAL LEVEL AND THAT THE ASSOCIATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THOSE. THROUGH A CHANGE IN THE BYLAWS NOT NECESSARILY A RULE. WE AGREE THAT THE IDEA OUR ISSUE A NEED TO BE ADDRESSED -- THEY PROVIDE THAT FOR A MEMBER IN GOOD STANDING WOULD JUST BE REGULAR ASSESSMENTS ARE NOTHING ABOUT SPECIALIST US ASSESSMENTS WHICH OCCUR. HOT THROUGHOUT ASSOCIATIONS ARE IN THE STATE. NOW WRAP UP ON THE WHY WE THINK THIS WILL SUPPRESS OUR ACTUAL PARTICIPATION IN IN THESE ELECTIONS THESE VOTE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE WAY THE BILL IS RED NOW -- MEMBERS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE VOTER REGISTRATION LIST THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THE BALLOTS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SIGNED ENVELOPES BASICALLY HAVE ACCESS TO EVERY PIECE OF PAPER AND THEN BE ALLOWED TO COPY THAT. MOST ASSOCIATIONS IN THE STATE AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT ARE LESS THAN FIFTY UNITS. I THESE ARE SMALL COMMUNITIES IT DOES NOT TAKE A WHOLE LOT OF EFFORT TO PUT THOSE BALLOTS TOGETHER. WITH ASSIGNED ENVELOPES AND REALLY START TO CREATE AN INVASION OF PRIVACY IN FACT THERE IS LITIGATION THERE'S COURT. CASE OUT THERE THAT HAS HELD THAT IN AN OWNER'S INTEREST PRIVACY CONSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS TO PRIVACY IS ACTUALLY A HIGHER BAR AND ALLOWING SOMEONE ACCESS TO THE COPYING OF THESE THESE DOCUMENTS WE THINK AT A MINIMUM. THAT PASSED TO BE A REMOVED TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY INTERESTS A OF THESE OWNERS THAT PARTICIPATE WITHOUT THAT. SIMPLY WILL SEE A WHOLE A WHOLE HOST OF VOTERS. NOT PARTICIPATE IN THESE ELECTIONS BECAUSE OF THE FEAR PRIVACY [inaudible] WE SUPPORT. UNBIASED ELECTIONS WE SUPPORT CLEAR AND CONCISE RULES ARE CONCERNED WITH THIS BILL RIGHT NOW IS IT IS SO CONVOLUTED. SO COMPLEX IT'S JUST GONNA RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND MORE LIKELY MORE NON COMPLIANCE A BY ASSOCIATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEREFORE WE OPPOSE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER WHAT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGERS -- WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHORS ACCEPTED A BUT FOR THE REASON CA I STATED WE WOULD ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH THOSE COMMENTS AND WE REMAIN OPPOSED. RIGHT OTHER ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE AND OPPOSITION. LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION. AYE YES MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO PROVE ELECTION FRAUD IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE UNIVERSE THE VOTERS SO YOU DON' KNOW WHO YOU'RE STARTING WITH WE PUT IN. SAFEGUARDS OF THE LEADING PEOPLE USE THE PARCEL THE HER HIGH I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT MY PARCEL NUMBER IS EVEN THOUGH I READ IT ON MY CHECK WHAT I PAY MY PROPERTY TAXES TWICE THE PRICE YEARS WERE TRYING. TO PROVIDE THAT BUT I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH THE THE OPPOSITION AS I HAVE THROUGHOUT THE RESERVE PRICE OF DEMOCRACY. YOU KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO COST US ONE OR TWO DOLLARS FOR THESE ELECTIONS THAT I THINK THAT THAT'S A VALUABLE PRICE TO PAY TO LIVE IN A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. TO SIT BACK AND SAY EVERYBODY PARTICIPATES IN A IN IN THE ELECTION -- IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL TODAY WE MOVE ONTO JUDICIARY I WILL -- WORKED WITH THE OPPOSITION ON WHETHER I WE CAN DO THIS STATUTORILY OR BYLAWS AT AND YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO HAVE PACKAGES. A UNUSUAL BECAUSE TO ME I KNOW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS THAT WHILE THE AT THE CREATION OF THE THAT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS REQUIRED THAT THEY HAVE ELECTION AT THE INCORPORATION MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE ANY. PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THEM TO HAVE ON GOING. YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME UNIFORMITY I'M WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THAT -- THE THRESHOLDS BUT WITH THAT I AM I WOULD. VIRGIN AYE VOTE. GREAT ARAB AND WITHOUT APPRECIATE JET YOUR WORK ON THIS AND FOR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I THINK CLEARLY WE ALL WANT TO STAND FOR OF FAIR ELECTIONS THAT ARE TRANSPARENT -- AND THAT WORKED AND SO WITH THAT -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND HAVE A DO PASS AS AMENDED RECOMMENDATION AND I DO KNOW THAT THIS WILL BE GOING ON TO ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHERE. A NUMBER OF US WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THAT SO -- WITH THAT -- I'LL TAKE THAT AS YOUR FINAL COMMENT IT LOOKS LIKE DOCTOR CHOI YOU HAVE A QUESTION. I'M ASK OF SENATOR -- IN NY. WOULD BE -- SO DIFFICULT TO LEAVE US. OUT TO THE ELECTED BODY. PARTS OF THE UP BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF EACH -- STUFF BICU A RULE RECESS AND THAT THEY ARE [inaudible] CONSTANTLY -- YEAH YOU READ ACTED. IF THE YEAH I HAVE A PROBLEM SO THAT THE MEMBERS SO ORDER ORDER ORDER -- CHOOSES SOMEBODY OUTSIDE AND THEN A CAN YOU TELL IF OFFICE TANAKA LIVING DOCUMENT THOUGH WHY DO WE HAVE TO GOVERN OVER THE ELECTED. BOARD OF DIRECTORS BECAUSE IN SOME INCIDENCES LEASE WITH THE I SO THE CENTER FOR HOMEOWNERS RIGHTS THEY'VE SHOWED REPEATED -- TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN USE TO DISASSOCIATE UP PEOPLE FROM THE ELECTORAL PROCESS JUDGE SERB MADE BIG IF YOU MORE SPUR PACIFIC. YES DR J. WHAT. WHAT HAPPENS IN MANY OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS IS THAT THE BOARD WHICH HAS NOW HAS THE POWER TO SET? ANY QUALIFICATIONS WITHOUT LIMIT. ON WHO CAN RUN FOR THE BOARD IN THAT POWER HAS BEEN ABUSED IN A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS THAT WE HAVE DOCUMENTED. AND SO ONE OF THE KEY PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL IS IT GREATLY LIMITS THE BASIS ON WHICH A PERSON CAN BE DISQUALIFIED. FROM RUNNING FOR THE BOARD THAT IS ONE OF THE MECHANISMS OF PRIMARY MECHANISMS HOW IN INCOME AND BOARD REMAINS IN POWER IS DON'T ALLOW OTHERS TO RUN. AND THROUGH THE CHAIR I WOULD SAY FOR THE THE GOOD ACTING IN A DEMOCRATICALLY EMBRACING HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION THIS THIS WILL BE A NOTHING BURGER FOR THEM BUT FOR THE PEOPLE HAVE WHO HAVE HAD THESE BOARDS THAT HER. ABUSIVE AND AND AND AND NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE SUSPECT ASSOCIATION PARTICIPATE I THINK THIS COULD BE A WATERSHED CHANGE OF OPERATION AND THERE ELECTIONS. AND WITH THAT ANY FINAL COMMENTS. FROM LOCK TO LAFAYETTE IN LOS ANGELES TWO WAMPOS WE NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE. FIVE SUPPORTERS THANK YOU THERE'S BEEN A MOTION MOVE THE BILL BY MISTER CHILD SECOND BY MS IMAN MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION TO BUSES AMENDED TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHU AYE CHIU AYE MAIENSCHEIN CHOW CHOW AYE CHOI KNOW JOEY NO. GLORIA. LEE MON. WE MONTH I WOULD. YOUR BILL HAS THREE VOTES WILL WAIT FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON AND WITH THAT WE WILL GO TO THE FINAL BILL ON TODAY'S AGENDA AND THAT IS FILE ITEM TO SP. EIGHT THIRTY ONE MISTER SENATOR UP. THANK YOU ARM [inaudible] SO WHEN. THE GOAL OF WILL BE. WELL I GUESS. I AM UNABLE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE WRITTEN REPORT THAT WILL HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND WE WILL GO FORWARD AYE. AYE. THE GOAL OF THE S. B. EIGHT THREE ONE AYE IS TO ELIMINATE THE REMAINING BARRIERS TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF ACCESSORY TWELVE DWELLING UNITS OR A. D. U.'S. TWO YEARS AGO I WAS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND S. B. ATTEND SIXTY NINE I AM WHEN IT WENT INTO EFFECT EIGHTY YOU PERMIT APPLICATIONS INCREASED BY 63% AND CALIFORNIA IN SOME AREAS LIKE. A MISS LIMON SAYS SANTA BARBARA IT WAS THREE HAD OVER 3100%. HOWEVER HUNDREDS OF HOMEOWNERS ARE STOPPED IN THEIR TRACKS WHEN THEY'RE HANDED A SIXTY THOU SEE HE THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL FOR IMPACT FEES BY THAT ME MUNICIPALITY. SOMETIMES THESE FEES I CAN AMOUNT TO MORE THAN THE COST TO THE CONVERTED GARAGE TO THE EIGHTY YOU. AS A RESULT PEOPLE RESORT TO BUILDING THESE UNITS WITHOUT A PERMIT. IN FACT THE STUDY FOR IN SANTA CRUZ FOUND THAT ONLY 46% OF THE AT THE EIGHTY USE IN THIS COUNTY HAD PERMITS. IT'S THE 1% OF HOMEOWNERS A WITH THESE AND PERMITTED EIGHTY YOU CITED THAT THE FEES WAS THE REASON FOR MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT HAVING A PERMIT. WE ARE PUSHING THESE UNITS INTO THE SHADOWS BY REFUSING TO ADDRESS THE UNTOUCHABLE FEES THAT SOME CITIES ARE. UP PROPOSING I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT FREMONT FREMONT AFTER HAVE AG ACTUALLY PRO HAVING LISTENED TO ME FOREVER PESTICIDE THAT THEORY PACKED IN COURT ARE NOT GOING TO CHARGE IMPACT FEES AS HIS SAN DIEGO. BUT A RECENT STUDY PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND PERMITTED EIGHTY USE IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA ALONE THERE'S THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND EIGHTY USE IN THE GREATER. LOS ANGELES ON THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT. THERE'S A REASON WHY PEOPLE DON'T GO TO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND GET A PERMIT THEY AND THEY'VE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE FIRED [inaudible] FOR A PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS DO NOT ACCOUNTED FOR WATER AND SEWAGE DISTRICT THEY ARE NOT THEY DID NOT PAY ANY IMPACT FEES. THE BIG THEY'RE NOT PAYING ANY PROPERTY TAXES. BUT AND NOW. NOBODY. NO NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE BROUGHT UP WHICH AMP TRACK WERE TRYING TO DO TODAY THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS A PROPERTY TAXES WITH EIGHTY YOU UNITS. SO LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO BREAKDOWN OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE AVERAGE COST OF AN EIGHTY YOU IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE BILL. THAT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION THAT DIFFERENT EDIE WAS ASSESSED AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE PROPERTY TAXES INCREASED BY 1% THAT'S A VALUE OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS. PER UNIT THAT IN THE IN THE STATE. OF LOS ANGELES HAS. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND PERMITTED BY UNITS SO WHAT'S TAKEN CONSERVATISM SEE THAT'S A HALF A MILLION UNITS IN CALIFORNIA THAT UNDER THE CURRENT REGIME WITH THE CITY SICK CHARGING THE IMPACT FEES THAT THEY WANT. THAT'S THAT'S ANNUAL TAX REVENUE OF SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT THE EXISTING PERMITTED UNITS THAT'S PART OF THE THE PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT HAS FOR AN AMNESTY WE WANNA HAVE SOME. REASON FOR PEOPLE TO COME OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND SAY I'M GOING TO GET MY PLACE PER MINUTE NOT TO PAY THE FULL FEE BUT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN AMNESTY PROGRAM. THE IMPACT FEES TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE FUNDING REALLY FOR CITIES I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE NOBODY GETTING THE PERMIT YOU'RE GETTING A 100% BUT ZERO WHICH IS. ZERO IT DOESN'T IT THAT THE NUMBERS DON'T WORK OUT ELIMINATING THE IMPACT FEES ONE SURE THAT STEVE CONSTRUCTIONS OF EXCESS READ WELL IN UNITS AND CAN HELP IN OUR LONG TERM REVENUE I'M. WE NEED TO BE SMART ABOUT THIS AND LOOK AT THE LONG TERM WITH ME THAT DAY IS CORNELIUS BURKE WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AND VIANI NAVA WHICH A CALIFORNIA. OR SILICON VALLEY WHICH WHICH IS ALSO IN CALIFORNIA. ARM TEAR TO ENCOURAGE THE SUPPORT OF S. B. [inaudible] EIGHT THIRTY ONE I MEAN WE'VE HAD. HI MY NAME IS BEN AND I WITH THE HOUSING TRUST ON THE EMAIL YOU PROGRAM MANAGER. THE HOUSING TRUST IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE WE'RE ACTUALLY NONPROFIT HOUSING LENDER IN THE BAY AREA WE COVER THIRTEEN COUNTIES -- AND WE BILL EIGHTY YOU PROGRAM BECAUSE WE BELIEVE EIGHTY USER A GREAT TOOL TO HELP WITH HOUSING CRISIS ALLEVIATE THE HOUSING CRISIS. IT'S A MULTI GENERATIONAL TOOL WHERE -- HOMEOWNERS CAN USE TO HOUSE SIR -- THEY'RE OLDER THEIR ADULT CHILDREN THEIR AGING PARENTS AND THAT THEY COULD ALSO DOWNSIZING TO AT AND THE PROCESS TO GET IN THAT'S DON IS OFTENTIMES DIFFICULT AND DON TEAM AND JUST A WHOLE OTHER LANGUAGE NOT TO MENTION EXPENSIVE. EXPENSE UPS ARE EIGHTY YOU PROGRAM THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING INCLUDES WORKSHOPS FOR EDUCATION. AS WELL AS WE'RE COMING UP WITH THE FINANCIAL PROGRAM TO HELP PEOPLE GET THROUGH WHAT THE SENATOR WAS TALKING ABOUT THESE PERMIT FEES ARE A HUGE BARRIER FOR HOMEOWNERS HOMEOWNERS. STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN THE HOMEOWNERS ARE VERY EXCITED TO BUILD EIGHTY YOU BECAUSE ALL OF THESE BENEFITS AND THAT CAN BILL WELL FOR THEM. BUT ONCE THEY GET THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO PULL HE WOULD YOU BILL -- OFTENTIMES BE -- AS HIGH AS 10% OF THE TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COST AND SO IT'S A HUGE BURDEN NOT JUST ECONOMICALLY BUT I THINK ALSO PSYCHOLOGICAL -- TO GET THROUGH THIS I THINK THERE'S THROUGH OUR PROGRAM WOULD BE TALKING TO HOMEOWNERS WHO WE FOUND MORE AND MORE OFTEN THAT WHEN I ASK HOMEOWNER WHY THEY WANT TO BUILD. THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION SO HERE'S A HOMEOWNER THAT MAYBE DOESN'T HAVE ALL THESE OTHER NEEDS LIKE OTHER PEOPLE THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. THEY GO DOWN TO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND BUILDING AND SUMMIT AND THEN THEY GET A HUGE BELL AND I THINK THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL. PSYCHOLOGICALLY IT BECOMES A BARRIER OF LIKELY I'M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING GOOD AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY DECIDE TO BUY FROM YOU FROM DOING THAT LIKE IF THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S GONNA BE CONSTRUCTION COST BUT I THINK A LOT OF HOMEOWNERS FEEL LIKE I'M. THE CITY SHOULD BE SUPPORTING THEM -- AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THAT THE IMPACT FEES AS A BEAR TO BUILDING. EIGHTIES. THEREFORE THE HOUSING TRUST SUPPORTS S. B. EIGHT THIRTY ONE WHICH PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE ELEMENT IMPACT FEES IN CAP SCHOOLS ARE THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE FIND THAT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE -- IMPORTANT SOLUTION FOR THE PRODUCTION OF IDIOTS FIGURE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CORNELIUS BURKE WITH THE BAY I'LL BET THE BAY AREA COUNCIL REPRESENT THREE HUNDRED THE TOP EMPLOYERS IN THE BAY AREA REGION. OUR COMPANIES ARE TELLING US IS YOU KNOW THAT'S HOW THE CRISIS REALLY MAKE IT QUITE DIFFICULT TO FIND. TRACK AND RETAIN TALENT A WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS WHAT WE NEED TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING. EIGHTY WAS GETS US THERE WE ALSO HAVE BOLD AND AMBITIOUS CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS IN THE STATE WHEN YOU REDUCE THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. HAVE REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES ARE EIGHTY SMART DELICATE INFILL DEVELOPMENT. ALSO WE TALK ABOUT LOCAL DISPOSAL LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL BILL. I GIVES POWER BACK TO THE HOMEOWNERS THAT YOU CAN ANY MORE LOCAL THAN THAT -- FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT THIS BILL REQUEST WE ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT CAN. HATE THAT MAKE. I NEVER SEVERE REVENGE I AM HOMEOWNER -- WHO WOULD BENEFIT ENORMOUSLY FROM S. B. -- EIGHT THIRTY ONE THE NEW LAWS REGARDING EIGHTY USE HAVE ALREADY HELPED PUSH ME FROM THE CAMP OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT CONSIDER BUILDING AN EIGHTY YEAR TO PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT BUILDING EIGHTY USE -- I REALLY BELIEVE THAT HAVING A REGULATIONS IN PROTECTIONS AND FRANKLY JUST PRESS AT THE STATE LEVEL -- IS REALLY CRITICAL FOR HOMEOWNERS LIKE ME TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S LEGITIMATE AND NOT UNDER THE TABLE A PUBLIC MOST OF MY NEIGHBORS HAVE DONE IN THE PAST -- SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED BUT THAT'S A PART OF THIS BILL IS TAKING OUT THE LOOK A LOT COVERAGE -- WHICH IS REALLY CRITICAL FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO MIGHT HAVE SMALLER LOTS -- WHERE THE CITY IS LIKE REALLY DETERMINE THEIR PLANNING DEPARTMENTS DON'T WANT YOU TO PUT SOMETHING BACK THERE -- AND THEY USE LIGHT AREA COVERAGE AS A WAY TO BLOCK THAT SO I CANNOT. REALLY CRITICAL -- ALSO THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS OPEN UP POSSIBILITIES -- IT'S LIKE I HAVE A REALLY OLD GRUDES TOTALLY UNCLEAR WHETHER IT'S ONE SPACE FOR TWO SPACES IN THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT WILL USE THAT TO SAY. I CAN'T BELIEVE NAY YOU UNLESS THEY REPLACED THE GARAGE AND YOU KNOW I CAN AFFORD TO PUT DOWN A SLAB AND PUT DOWN A PREFAB EDU I CANNOT AFFORD TO ALSO REALLY ASKING MY ENTIRE YARD PUT IN A NEW GARAGE AND IN YOUR DRIVEWAY -- I ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE THE AT THE TIME LIMIT -- THAT THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO HAVE -- I HAVE NEIGHBORS WITH NIGHTMARE STORIES ABOUT -- PLANNING DOCUMENTS GETTING LOST AND EVEN JUST HAVING A TIME LIMIT SO LIFE SOME IDEA OF HOW LONG THE PROCESS MIGHT TAKE AT THE PLANNING LEVEL -- HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE STRESS OF THE PROCESS BECAUSE IT PUTS ANOTHER KNOWN IN THEIR IN. I MEAN ENDING POINTS BACKED WHAT VA SAID I WANT TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THE HOUSING CRISIS -- THOSE FEES ARE A HUGE EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIER I WANT TO GO OUT AND I WANT TO DO SOMETHING GOOD -- AND ON TOP OF THAT ACTUALLY NEED THE INCOME MY MY PARTNER IS SEC -- AND AYE LOSSES INCOME LAST YEAR AND SO IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR HOUSE -- I REALLY NEED TO FIND ANOTHER SOURCE OF INCOME AND IN EIGHTY YOU WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO DO THAT BUT THE FEES THAT ARE HAVE TO PAY ON TOP OF THE UNIT ITSELF. ARE A MASSIVE BARRIER TO ME ACTUALLY -- FOR TO BE PROFITABLE FOR ME TO BUILD THE EIGHTY SO I AM I REALLY SUPPORT SB EIGHT THIRTY ONE IT WOULD BE ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL THANK YOU.

MARJORIE MURRAY CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION LAW IN SUPPORT WE THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING FORTH THIS MEASURE. GOOD MORNING MISS SHARON MEMBERS AND COMMUNISTS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES JUMPING IN HERE IS A NEUTRAL IF I COULD JUST TO MAKE. A COMMENT -- WE WOULD NEUTRALIZE LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE SENATOR AND AND STAFF IN THE HARD WORK THEY PUT IN COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL. JUST ONE TO POINT OUT THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. YOUR IN THE BILL THAT -- DESPITE THE AGREEMENT WE'VE WE'VE REACHED WHERE FEES I AM IT THAT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE DOES EXPANDED THE LIST OF EIGHTY USE THAT WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THOSE FEES THE WAY IT'S DRAFTED SO I WE'VE SUBMITTED LANGUAGE TO COMMITTEE STAFF AND AND THE AUTHORS OFFICE. TO ADDRESS THAT WE THINK IT SAID A TECHNICAL FIX THAT WOULD THAT WOULD ADDRESS THAT CONCERN. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU -- LET ME ASK IF THERE'S OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WE CAN MAKE SOME ROOM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SCHEMES WANTING AS MUCH OR IF. CHAIR MEMBERS NVIDIA WITH THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DO -- REMAIN OPPOSED -- THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA IS BASED ON THREE THINGS RIGHT STATE. BONDS LOCAL BONDS AND DEVELOPER IMPACT FEES AND SO OBVIOUSLY OF THIS HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SCHOOLS ABILITY -- TO MEET THEIR STUDENT HOUSING NEEDS AND SO -- AND ALSO -- PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THAT DID JOB A LOT THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM IT AT A WHICH INCLUDES A OF THE FEES -- IN AND IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A CHANGE SO -- FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN OPPOSED AND CERTAINLY WE THOUGHT THE THE ANALYSIS -- IDENTIFIED THE OF THE CORRECT APPROACH THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND CHRIS LEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION I DO WANNA POINTOUT THAT WE AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND THOSE WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ADDRESSING OUR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. BUT OUR CONCERNS DO EXTEND ACTUALLY BR SO FIRST I WANT TO ECHO THAT THE BROAD CONCERN ABOUT PLACING ESSENTIALLY AN ARBITRARY RESTRICTION ON IMPACT FEES THAT THAT THE SCHOOLS HAVE CHF. JUST BROUGHT UP ON THESE ARE IS ESSENTIALLY SECOND HOMES THAT ARE BEING ADDED TO PARCELS AND IN COUNTY WORLD PEOPLE ARE PAYING IMPACT FEES TO SUPPORT LIBRARIES TO SUPPORT PARKS TO PORT SHARE OF STATIONS. SUPPORT ALL OF THESE PUBLIC GOODS THAT WE KNOW PEOPLE NEED IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE MOVING INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD AND INCREASING THE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICE SAYS. NOT TO MENTION ROADS WHERE WE JUST PASSED A BILL LAST YEAR S. B. ONE THAT INCLUDES AN INCENTIVE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CHARGE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEES TO HELP BRING THE LOCAL REVENUES INTO THE SYSTEM -- SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FEW LIMITATIONS I THINK THERE'S BEEN SORT OF A AN IMPRESSION GIVEN HERE THAT THESE VIEWS ARE ARBITRARILY CREATED AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE. WE HAVE THE MITIGATION FEE ACT WHICH REQUIRES THAT THESE FEES BE LINKED TO THE ACTUAL IMPACTS THAT ARE CREATED -- IF FEES ARE BEING CHARGED RIGHT NOW 280- USE THAT ARE NOT PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR IMPACTS THAT WE SHOULD THROW THE BOOK AT THOSE PEOPLE WE SHOULD REQUESTED JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE AUDIT. AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHY THE FEES ART AND ACTUALLY PROPORTIONATE TO THE SIZE OF THE UNIT OR THE NUMBER OF BEDROOMS TO THE ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE IMPACTS THAT ARE HAPPENING. AND SO WE WERE JUST GOING TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE IN THE LAW AND SAY THAT THESE FEES MUST BE PROPORTIONATE THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD SUPPORT AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING. WHERE AND YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT THAT SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING UNDER EXISTING LAW EVEN -- ASIDE FROM THE FEE ISSUE WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT SOME HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES THAT ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. SECTION THREE OF THE BILL IS ESSENTIALLY THE EXCEPTION THAT EIGHT THE ROLE SO WHILE SECTION ONE AND THE OTHER PARTS OF THE BILL. ALLOW US TO PRECLUDE EXCEPT THREE DWELLING UNITS BASED ON HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS FOR INSTANCE WE'VE SEEN SEVERAL LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT PRECLUDE EIGHTY USE IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES WE'VE SEEN SEVERAL LOCAL ORDINANCES LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR INSTANCE JUST APPROVED BEARS. THAT PRECLUDES EIGHTY USE AND HEALTH SITE MANAGEMENT ZONES WHERE LANDSLIDES OR COMMENT ESPECIALLY IF YOU ALSO HAVE A FIRE AND THAT'S HAPPENED AND SO WE THINK IT'S AGAINST GOOD PUBLIC POLICY TO PRECLUDE. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM LIMITING FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS WHERE THOSE TYPES OF EIGHTY USE LISTED IN SECTION THREE OF THE BILL CAN ACTUALLY BE PLACED. SO UNDER SECTION THREE OF THE BILL WE WOULD HAVE TO ALLOW BY RIGHT ON ANY PARCEL THAT HAS A SINGLE FAMILY HOME EXISTING. STAND ALONE EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT EIGHTY YOU UP TO TWO EIGHTY USE ON A MULTI FAMILY PARCEL WITH AND HOUSING AS WELL AS CONVERSIONS WHICH ARE ALREADY BY RIGHT. AND THERE'S ALSO WE'RE WE'RE NOT AS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BUT THERE'S ALSO THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING SPACE WITH AND MULTI FAMILY DWELLING UNITS. SO AT THE VERY LEAST WE NEED TO HAVE THE SAME ABILITY TO PRECLUDE THOSE BY RIGHT SORT OF DEFAULT EIGHTY USE IN SECTION. THREE THAT WE DO IN THE REST OF OUR ORDINANCES BECAUSE THE WAY IT FUNCTIONS NOW IS IT'S REALLY AN EXCEPTION THAT UNDERMINES ALL THE OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BILL -- FINALLY I WANT TO SAY THAT. FOR APPROVAL AND WE CAN ACCEPT AN ACCELERATED TIME FRAME AND I THINK WE'VE INDICATED TO THIS AUTHOR OF NOT IN MY DEFENSE OF THE OTHER TWO EIGHTY YUBA AUTHORS. AND THAT WE COULD ACCEPT A NINETY DAYTIME FRAME IF IT REQUIRES SUBMISSION OF A COMPLETE APPLICATION. ON AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS -- INSTANCE WHERE THERE'S A DEEMED APPROVED REMEDY IN THE BILL AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED AS I MENTIONED THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WOULD BE I THINK A GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ON I THINK WE CAN HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NEXT YEAR WHEN EACH C. D. COMPLETES THE ANALYSIS OF THE MITIGATION FEE ACT THAT WAS REQUIRED BY AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE FROM LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. BUT UNTIL THAT TIME WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE AND AGAINST GOOD PUBLIC POLICY TO ARBITRARILY PRECLUDE THESE NEW SECOND UNITS FROM PAYING THE IMPACT FEES THAT SUPPORT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND FACILITIES THAT THE RESIDENTS THERE BONNIE THANK YOU. SARAH ROGERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AMENDMENTS. JEFF RIGHTLY CALIFORNIA CITIES AND WE ALSO SUPPORT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL I'M JUST VERY BRIEFLY ON THE FEES SOME REALLY CLEARED AB AGREE WITH WHAT DOES HE SEC MENTION HE'S WRITTEN ABOUT MITIGATION FEE ACT IT IS ILLEGAL FOR A CITY. TO CHARGING A FEE BASED ON MITIGATION FEE ACT IF THAT HE'S GONNA THEN GO TO THE GENERAL FUND THE FUNDS CAN ONLY BE USED FOR THE SERVICES THERE REALLY DEMANDED BY THOSE WHO RESIDE IN THAT NEW EIGHTY YOU. I'M IN BUT WE ARE PURPOSES. ORINDA VALENCIA REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION ALSO OPPOSED IN WHAT I CALL THE COMMENTS RAISED AND JUST ONE AD WE DO APPRECIATE THAT. A REFERENCE TO THE AND NATIONAL POLICY A STUDY THAT WAS DONE -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A LOT OF CHANGES IN THIS BILL BEYOND FEES I'M AND THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW OR LOOKING AT MAJOR CHANGES SOMETHING. YEAH LAST YEAR. KELLY BRICKS ON BEHALF OF THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION AND WE WOULD ECHO THE COMMON IT'S ABOUT SUPPORTING ON THAT A COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. DAVID JONES ABAFT THE CITIES OF BURBANK THE CITIES OF MARIN. CITY IS OF ME PERIODIC AND SAN MARCOS ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT LEAVING MY FRIENDS FROM CAESAR. ALICE KESSLER ON BEHALF OF JUST ONE CITY CITY OF LONG BEACH ALSO RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION. KATIE ALMOND WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS OPPOSITION. THANK YOU LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND I'LL START OFF WITH SOME COMMENTS -- FIRST OF ALL A FOR A COLLEAGUES I WANNA JUST -- LAY OUT A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED AND A SENATOR AND I I THINK WE'VE HAD FOR CONVERSATIONS ON THIS. AND YOU'VE BEEN ABLE FOR IF NOT MORE THINK FOR AND OUR STAFF HAVE HAD PROBABLY -- SEVERAL DOZEN POT AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE WON ME OVER ON MANY THE MINUTES THAT WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK -- WITH ONE EXCEPTION AND THAT IS THE FEE ISSUE AND I RAISE THAT TO SAY THAT I THINK WHERE I AM AND WHERE THE SENATOR ARE WE AGREE ON 95% OF THIS BILL. ARE AND IT'S JUST THAT ONE LAST PIECE THAT WE ARE -- LITTLE BIT STUCK ON AND I'LL JUST SAY IN THE STAFF ANNOUNCES THIS BILL DOES SIXTEEN THINGS AND UP THE ONE ISSUE THAT -- THAT I KNOW YOU FOCUSED YOUR TESTIMONY ON WHICH WAS THAT THE FEAR SHE WAS THE ONE THAT WE'RE WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THIS BILL DOES A LOT OF THINGS WE ARE ASKING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO A LOT OF THINGS AND I THINK. IT THIS TIME UP WITHOUT FURTHER ANALYSIS OUGHT TO SAY THAT -- WITH THAT WITH JUST THE CAP ON SCHOOL FEES AND A WITH THE ISSUES WITH RELATED TO UTILITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CANNOT -- ASK ANY OTHER FEES. I'M I'M NOT COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS ZERO NOW I WILL SAY THAT I AGREE WITH YOU. THAT THERE DO APPEAR TO BE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE FEES ARE TOO HIGH -- BUT THAT IS WHY LAST YEAR AS PART OF THE HOUSING PACKAGE WE SUPPORTED AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE WHICH WILL REQUIRE A STUDY OF THE IMPACT FEES TO COME BACK. TO THIS LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THESE ISSUES I THINK WE WILL LIKELY HAVE A VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR ABOUT ALL HOUSING IMPACT FEES AND I'M JUST WORRIED. THAT DEALING WITH THIS AND AND IN A IN SUCH A BIFURCATED WAY FULL ANALYSIS. I THINK IT'S A BIT PREMATURE OUT ALSO SAY THIS COMMITTEE -- SEVERAL WEEKS AGO WE HAD ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAMS BILL WHICH YOU KNOW IS A BILL THAT IS A COMPANION BILL TO THIS. ONE AYE AND WE HAD ASKED HIM TO TAKE THOSE. A REQUIREMENTS OUT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE DID. AND SO I THINK OUT OF CONSISTENCY WOULD MAKE SENSE TO DO THAT THAT BEEN SAID YOU KNOW YOU WE JUST WE'VE DISCUSSED OF THE LAST FEW DAYS SOME WAY TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PROPORTIONALITY FEES WOULD LOOK LIKE WE JUST HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH LANGUAGE -- I'M OPEN TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION THROUGH THE PROCESS -- IN IN THE COMING WEEKS IF WERE ABLE TO GET THERE A BUT I THINK AT THIS TIME THE IDEA OF JUST SIMPLY TAKING ALL THE FEES OUT -- GIVEN ALL THE THINGS THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS A LITTLE PREMATURE AND I WILL JUST SAY JUST TO SUMMARIZE. THIS BILL IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS IT REQUIRES LOCAL AGENCIES TO POTENTIALLY DESIGNATE AREAS WERE EIGHTY USE MAY BE EXCLUDED FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS. SAYS AT LOCAL AGENCIES CAN'T ESTABLISH STANDARDS AROUND MINIMUM LOT SIZES -- REFERENCES SQUARE FOOTAGE IS A PROPOSED EIGHTY USE MINIMUM MAXIMUM SIZES FOR EIGHTY YEARS SETBACKS GARAGES CARPORTS NAM APPLICATION TIME FRAMES -- I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND WHAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO DO IS IT LAYERS MANY ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHICH I SUPPORT. BUT AGAIN THE IDEA OF SAYING WE'RE GONNA LAYER ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS -- BUT SAY THAT LOCALS ARE UNABLE TO RECOUP ANY OF IT THAT'S WHAT'S GIVING ME A LITTLE BIT HARPER SO ODD RABBIT YOU KNOW HAVING DISCUSSION YOU KNOW I'VE HAD A COUPLE TIMES BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY ALL THAT. LET ME TRY TO NARROW THE THE WINDOW THAT THAT THAT I THINK THE ADVOCATE WHO IS REFLECTIVE THE ADVOCATES IN IN THE SPIRIT OF AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GONNA COME BACK TO US NEXT. NEXT YEAR AND PROBABLY NOT COULD HAVE REGULATIONS TILL TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF IT IF IT IF IF THEY COME BACK WITH RECOMMENDATIONS SO WE BRAG BECAUSE THAT'S THAT THE THE THE STUDY SUPPOSED TO COME BACK NEXT YEAR SO WE COULD ACTUALLY. LA WE COULD ACTUALLY TAKE MAKE DECISION. OKAY EXACT I'M HOPING TO ALL TO SAY THAT FOR EVERYONE WHO. NOW THERE'S A MOVE HOPE THAT WE DON'T BUT SO THE POINT OF ASKING THE STUDY TO COME BACK NEXT YEAR TO GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY HERE'S MY CONCERN IN THE MATCH -- WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND PERMITTED UNITS ARE NOT THERE'S STILL A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT OF FUN PER MINUTE YOU. AND AND AND THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE AN AMNESTY PROGRAM IF THEY HAVE TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR THE PERMITS THAT THEY HAVE THEY'RE NOT PAYING PROPERTY TAXES AND THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COUNT THAT WE THAT OUR HOUSING ELEMENTS AND EVERYTHING HAS. SO IF WE'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE A HAVE THE THE WAIVER OF THE FEES UNTIL WE TAKE SUCH ACTION AND THEN THAT WOULD BE WITH THE RESULT OF AB. SEVEN NINE A EIGHT SEVEN NINE AND THERE'S A THERE'S A CONSENSUS IN LEGISLATION THAT THE GOVERNOR -- SIGNS THEM WHAT WE WILL BE DOING IS IS IS WILL HAVE A YEAR OR EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR TWO YEARS THAT THERE WOULD BE THIS WINDOW SO THAT ALL THE BOOTLEG UNITS WOULD KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO GO NOW. OR THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE THAT. AT CPAP PAY THE FEE ADDITIONALLY ALL BE ABLE TO SHOW AT THAT TIME HOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE COME ONLINE AND ARE PAYING THE PROPERTY TAXES. BECAUSE YOU KNOW AGAIN THESE WE WEEK CONVENIENTLY FORGET THE FIRST WORD OF THE THE FEES WERE TALKING ABOUT IS DEVELOPER IMPACT FEES. THE SERVER HOMEOWNERS THEIR PAIN THE IMPACT FEES THEY'RE TREATING THEM THE ALL OF THEM ARE TREATING THEM LIKE THEY'RE DEVELOPERS BUT THEY'RE NOT DEVELOPERS HERE'S THEIR OUR NEIGHBORS OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE PUTTING IN A SECOND UNIT. THEY'RE NOT A DEVELOPER IMPACT FEE SO IN THAT SPIRIT I GET IT WHEN YOU COME IN YOUR EACH WEEK CAN BE HOMES THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING BUT BUT WE'VE ALLOWED THE SCHOOLS AND THE COUNTIES. AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO TREAT THESE. AS THOUGH THEIR DEVELOPERS AND WE'VE HEARD IT INSTEAD AND PREVIOUS SO. I KNOW THAT THAT IS A BIG LEAP FOR ME TOOK A TO TAKE BUT BUT I'D AT LEAST. MAYBE ALL BE WRONG AND WILL HAVE THIS WINDOW OF TIME WHATEVER IT IS TO TAKE TO IT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ANYTHING FEES I'M WILLING. TO FALL ON THE SWORD AND SAY I'VE I FEEL SO -- DRIVEN THAT I NEED I NEED TO SHOW THAT THESE FOLKS CAN COME OUT AND WE CAN ACTUALLY. ADDRESS THE HOUSING ISSUES THAT THAT ALL LIVE WITH EVERITT WHATEVER THE AT EACH CD COMES OUT ON WHAT THEY BELIEVE WILL BE THE IMPACT THE IMPACT FEES ON EIGHTY USE THAT WOULD BE THAT BECOME THE STATE LAW WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS. AND GIVE ME A SMALL WINDOW OF TIME TO TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME OF THESE PEOPLE UNDER THE AMNESTY PROGRAM. A COME FORWARD INTO LEGITIMATELY PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITIES THAT'S I I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT THAT'S FAIR BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BARRIER THAT'S OUT THERE AND I REALLY I UNDERSTAND THE CHAIR AND AND THE COUNTIES IN EVERYBODY'S. INTERESTED IN HAVING MORE HOUSING A A UP THERE IN THE ACT BY. I DO THAT WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR THE CHAIR IN THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR THE WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE FOR THIS SMALL WINDOW UNTIL THEY MAKE THEIR DECISION AND WE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW WHAT THE NEW FEES ARE GOING TO BE FOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS WHICH I THINK. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR. SO WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAYING IS THE POTENTIAL SMALL WINDOW THAT THAT'S NOT AN IDEA THAT. I I KNOW WE HAD DISCUSSED THAT SO I GUESS I WOULD LIKE ON IT. I SLEPT ON A COUCH AND WE DID HAVE A CHANCE RIGHT WE DON'T JUST TALK THIS MORNING ELIMINATE LET ME LET ME SAY A FEW THINGS AND RESPONSE -- I KNOW YOU CHARACTERIZE THIS AS HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE ARE TRYING TO BUILD EXTRA HOME THAT IS THE CASE WITH WITH MOST. OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT WE ARE NOT ASKING YOU TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED AN OWNER OCCUPIED. REQUIREMENT WHICH DOES ME MANY MANY. MANY MANY AND LAW UNITS I IN WE'RE NOT ASKING FEE. THERE ARE THAT FEELS A LITTLE BIT -- FEELS A LITTLE BIT STRANGE WE ALSO KNOW IT WAS ALIVE. WE ALSO KNOW AT THIS TIME THERE ARE CITIES THAT HAVE CHOSEN BECAUSE THEY'VE MADE THE CALCULATION LIKE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. OUGHT TO OUGHT TO WEIGH FEES TO HAVE AN AMNESTY AND I THINK THAT IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ARE DECIDED THAT THAT WAS THE RIGHT POLICY BECAUSE THEY WOULD EXPECT TO SEE MORE IN PROPERTY TAXES. ARE THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND DO IT THERE'S NOTHING THAT PREVENTS A LOCAL CITY. A CITY FROM FROM MOVING FOR DOING THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW THOUGH IS THAT THIS IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL LET'S. ELIMINATE ALL FEES FOR ALL JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE TWO CATEGORIES THAT YOU ENUMERATED IN AGAIN FOR THAT'S WHAT WINDOW FOR A SMALL WINDOW OF TIME. UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE ACCENT EACH ARE A CD. ROD RECOMMENDATIONS SO THAT IT WOULD BE TIME WHAT IS TIME SENSITIVE WE WOULD PUT AMEND THIS BILL SO THAT WHEN THAT BECAME THE LAW WE WOULD PUT IT IN. AND AND AGAIN WE IT RATHER THAN FOCUS ON THAT THE FAIR CITIES HAVE A FEE THAT THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE AT ANOTHER THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO WORK WITH ME AND WORK WITH THE ADVOCATES THERE A LOT OF CITIES THAT ARE USED IN THE FEES. SIMPLY AS A WAY TO DISCOURAGE THE EIGHT ACT EIGHTY USE WE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A HISTORY -- THROUGHOUT THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THERE THERE AREN'T ANY EIGHTY USE THAT EARLY HOLD THAT BILL I MEAN THERE'S A UP HANDFUL OF THEM THE MOST OF THEM DO NOT GET PERMITS THERE'S A REASON WHY PEOPLE HAVEN'T DONE DONE THAT. IN IF WE JUST IF WE JUST CONTINUE WITH THAT ALLOW THE HOW COME THE BAD ACTORS CITIES AND THE AND THE OTHER CITIES IF IF THEY COME TO JESUS AND THEY CHANGE THE FEES WERE NOT NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT. THAT DESIRABILITY OF OF HAVING HOMEOWNERS BUILD THINGS AND AGAIN I THINK IN THE LONG PICTURE THE CITIES IN THE SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO BE MADE WHOLE BECAUSE IT WHO THAT TAX INCREMENT IS GOING TO BE. COMPORT AND THAT'S ON ME THAT'S ON ME WHEN I EIGHT CD COMES AND SO. THAT'S MY PLEA SO. APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AS AS I'VE SAID TO YOU AND I WILL MAKE THIS COMMITMENT THAT I AM PREPARED TO TO WORK WITH YOU DURING THIS PROCESS AFTER IF THIS BILL GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE. OUGHT TO THINK OF WHAT THE PROPORTIONAL -- SUGGESTION MIGHT BE AND HOW TO HANDLE THESE FEES ARE BUT I JUST THINK AT THIS POINT I IT'S THE LITTLE BIT TO TO WORK THIS OUT ON THE FLY WITH WHAT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS A DEADLINE OF WHEN. ANOTHER BILL MIGHT ESET THESE FEES SO WILL PASS WILL HAVE A WAIVER UNTIL ANOTHER BILL COMES ALONG THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD WOULD RESET FEES AND I I THINK IT'S BETTER TO JUST HAVE THE CONVERSATION AT ONCE AND WE DECIDE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO MOVING FORWARD SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK. BOB BUT AGAIN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT IF THIS BILL MOVES FOR OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY. ARE WITH THE STATUS QUO LOW WITH REGARDS TO FEES THAT OUT LATER ON OF THE PROCESS WE CAN'T THAT WE CAN ADDRESS. BUT LET'S HAVE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION MISTER GLORIA. THANK YOU AS CHAIRMAN AND SENATOR THANK YOU FOR OF THE BILL TODAY -- I APPRECIATE THE EXCHANGE AND OBVIOUSLY THE FOCUS ON THE ISSUE -- FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T AYE REPRESENTS EIGHTY EIGHT SO YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND MY POINT OF VIEW ON THIS ISSUE A WHICH IS STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AND I FEEL THIS WAY BECAUSE MY CITY CANNOT SOLVE THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. AND SO IF YOU SEE A BONE OF GRANNY FLAT SINCE WE'RE GOING UNITS WAVE YOUR CALL -- IN MY SEE THAT IS NO WAY GOING TO SOLVE THE POWER. AND AS AN OUT PROUD YIN BE ELECTED OFFICIAL -- I NEED MORE COMMITTEES DO THAT BECAUSE MY FOLKS ARE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN A MY ATTITUDES ON THIS ISSUE I WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT OTHERS WILL DO THEIR FAIR SHARE -- AND SO -- YOU KNOW THIS IS REALLY TO MISINFORM BY MY LOCALS A WHO LOOKED AT THIS CLOSELY OF ASSISTING DAHLE UNITS I THINK IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO OF THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM WHERE CLOSE TO FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE THE COUNCIL ACTION IT'S AS WELL AS I THINK. EIGHT THOUSAND POINT IS IS IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE I'VE HEARD FROM CONSTITUENTS WHO DON'T KNOW WHO BOB WHITE HOUSE HE IS WE DON'T KNOW WHO S. B. WHY S. B. EIGHT THIRTY ONE IS. TELLING ME THEY NEED THE FEES REDUCE FOR THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS -- AND SO IT'S VERY ODD OR UNUSUAL TO HAVE ORGANIC UNPROMPTED CONVERSATION THE CONSTITUENT ABOUT A POLICY IDEA BUT THIS IS ONE OF THEM. I WHEN I HEARD OF YOUR BILL I THINK IT'S WORTHWHILE TO TO MOVE THIS DIRECTION I SHARE THESE FEELINGS WITH THE CHAIR -- MIND COLLEAGUES MAY REMEMBER MR TEAMS BILL WAS HERE AND HAD A PROVISION SUMMER THIS I'D QUESTION WHY WAS REMOVED BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S THAT. A CRITICAL TO GO NO GO ON IF YOU BELIEVE AS I DO THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FACING THE STATE IS OUR HOUSING CRISIS THEN WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I'M I HEARD THAT THE SENATOR'S COMMENTS AND I SEE THIS IS DOUBLE REFERRED I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TAKE THE AMENDMENT THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING WHICH THINGS A REASONABLE SORT OF HALF MEASURE -- TO YOU KNOW SORT OF SUSPEND THIS FOR THE SHORT TERM UNTIL THE STUDY COMES BACK -- I THINK I KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE THE HONESTY OF IT TO TO KNOW FEES -- BUT YOU KNOW AS A FORMER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER YOU KNOW THAT I REALIZE HE'S HE'S A CRITICAL THE BUILDING LIBRARIES ARE ACTUALLY WHAT I'M EXISTING COMMUNITIES MOSTLY -- TO EXPANDING LIBRARIES IMPROVING LIBRARIES FIRE STATIONS ACCEPT IRA -- BUT GUYS NO ONE DELIVER THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT AFFORDABLE THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THEM TO LIVE -- AND I TEND TO AGREE WITH WHAT MR Y. KOWSKI SAYING IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO BRING THESE UNITS INTO COMPLIANCE. OBVIOUS OUT REASSESS THE PROPERTIES OF FOR THEY WERE ALL GOING PROPERTY TAXES WHICH THE HECK OF A LOT MORE MONEY -- THEN DEVELOP A ONE TIME DEVELOPER FEES SO I SUPPORT THIS MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY -- DE ENVISIONED OF NOT TO BE PROVOCATIVE BUT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S ANOTHER STOP BEFORE THE FLOOR THE ASSEMBLY AND THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I WOULD BE A TWO OF PSYC TWO STOPS MY APOLOGIES -- I CAN COUNT -- TO TO HAD THAT THERE'S ANOTHER STOP ON THE WAY IN THIS CAN ALLOW MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED BUT I MAKE THIS MOTION ON BEHALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS WHO. ARE TRYING TO DO THEIR VERY BEST TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BUT CAN DO BY THEMSELVES THEY NEED THE ENTIRE STATE MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION. ANY OTHER CONVERSATION BUT CHOI. SENATOR LISTENING TO OUR THE ARGUMENT DOUBLE ON FOR SIZE SO. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED. THEM MEETING IN THAT HAPPY MEDIUM OCCUR HEAVY DISCOUNT. IQS SO THAT DOT. COM DEVELOP BUT IN A IMPACT FEE. UP WE IMPACT THE A TWO COSTA TO BE ARE SO HIGH INTO ELIMINATING AND A LACK OF 50% 6% 80% DISCOUNT THAT AND TO STEER. US SOME REASONABLE RECHARGE IT BE MADE TO US WITHOUT A THE LOCAL AGENCIES WHO WOULD BE HAPPY. YES I HAVE ENTERTAIN THAT HEY WE ARE WE DOCTOR CHOI CHU I HAVE PROPOSED SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO BE PROPORTIONAL I JUST I THINK IT THIS TIME WITHOUT FURTHER DATA -- TO GO FROM WHAT IS BEING. PAID FOR RIGHT NOW DOWN -- TO ZERO WITH ALL OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT THIS BILL IS REQUIRING IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PUT A LOCAL. JURISDICTIONS AROUND EIGHTY YEARS FEELS INCREDIBLY ONEROUS SO I I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE MR GLORIA'S POINTED I AGREE I THINK THESE FEES. VERY LIKELY NEED TO BE REDUCED BUT I'M JUST NOT CERTAIN RIGHT NOW IF IT NEEDS TO BE REDUCED FROM A 100% DOWN. TO ZERO AND AGAIN CITIES THAT BELIEVE THAT. AN AMNESTY MAKES SENSE CAN GO FORWARD AND DO IT AND AND THAT'S WHAT SAN DIEGO HAS DONE. AND AND I ENCOURAGE OTHER CITIES IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THEY CAN DO. AS WELL BUT JUST TO HAVE THE STATE TELL EVER IT SHOULD TELL YOUR CITY OF IRVINE -- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN'T COLLECT FEES EVEN IF YOU'RE GONNA SPEND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IMPLEMENTING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF SACRAMENTO IS ASKING YOU TO IMPLEMENT. BOB THAT THAT JUST FEELS HONOR SO WE HAD WE HAD OFFERED SOME WHAT WE REFER TO AS MORE PROPORTIONAL -- LANGUAGE TO TO TRY TO REDUCE THE FEES WITHOUT ELIMINATING THE FEES CENTER WHITE HOUSE GET ON A FEW THOUGHTS ON ON THAT. I'M WALLS SO WE'RE ALL CLEAR YOU CAN STILL CHARGE PERMIT FEES YOU CAN STILL CHARGE INSPECTION FEES YOU CONSISTENT CHARGE THE IDEAS THAT YOU CHARGE THAT WORK THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN OVER THE TIP TO PROCESS THIS. I'M YOU KNOW WE'VE. THE IMPACT FEES ARE A A FLAT FEE THAT THE CITY COULD HAVE ON THE PARKS THAT THEY SAVED FOR FUTURE PARK SERVE CURRENT PARKS IT'S SEVEN GRAND IN ITS SEVEN GRANTS WHICH FOURTEEN THOUSAND WE ALLOWED. THEM. TO TO PUT THAT IN I'M. YOU KNOW THE BILL BEFORE YOU WE'VE TAKEN OUT AT LEAST FOR A FLAT FEE FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT IS THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ARM YOU KNOW WHEN I CAN I ASK WHERE THAT WE WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DISCERN WHERE THE THREE THOUSAND ALL FLIGHT WAS TEMPERATURES. ABOUT MCGWIRE'S -- HAVE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE IN THIS CENTURY WHAT'S IT BASED ON I THINK IT IN THE LOCAL AREA HE HAD -- NO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE SCHOOLS CANNOT CHARGING IMPACT FEE FOR AN EIGHTY YOU THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED FEET OR LAST. SO ALL THE ALL THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING OF AT SCHOOL IMPACTS IF IT'S FIVE INTERFERE LESS IT'S NOTHING SO IT'S BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND ABOVE THEY CAN HAVE AN IMPACT HE SAID THAT'S LIMITED. AND MOST THAT THE GARAGE CONVERSIONS ARE BETWEEN FOUR FIFTY AND FIVE FIFTY SO YOU KNOW THEY THAT THE WHAT YOU GET A CATCHES ANOTHER FIFTY FEET IN THE GARAGE CONVERSION SO. RATHER THAN PALM. QUIBBLE I I TOOK THE AMENDMENT IT WAS ASKED UPON ME I THOUGHT WHEN I WAS IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THAT CENTER SKINNER ABOUT. CONSOLIDATING THE BILL'S WITH HER SO I'M. THAT I DON'T. KNOW THAT IT'S SCIENTIFICALLY DRAWN I CHAIR. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW SCIENCE FAX THE I DATA. THERE WAS ANOTHER QUESTION I FORGOT IT'S I'M SORRY ANY OTHER ANY OTHER DISK FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS THAT DIE IF -- LEADS THIS HONUS AMNESTY PERIOD THAT DIDN'T GIVE WHEN -- THAT SO THAT MEANS SAID THERE'LL BE NO PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING. REGISTERED DAHLE PAY CORRECTIVE MEAN MY IN WHAT I ENVISIONED UNDER THE AMNESTY PROGRAM IS THAT THAT YOU WOULD FIRST YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE INSPECTOR TO COME OUT. AND SECOND YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR PERMIT FEE THAT'S THAT THAT'S THAT'S NINE THIS DISPUTABLE YOU COME IN THERE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR WHAT. WHATEVER THEY SAY HAS BEGUN TO MAKE IT. SAVE THAT NO I CENTER BATES HAS A BILL THAT SAYS IF YOU LOOK AT THE TIME WHEN IT WAS BUILT AND IT WAS A BILL TO CODE AT THAT TIME THE LANGUAGE HERE SAYS THAT WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU TEN YEARS. TO BRING IT UP UP TO SAFETY THAT IS MAKE IT THAT DETERMINATION BY THE INSPECTOR THE IDEA AND THEN THE IDEA WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT WITHOUT THE FEES IS THAT PEOPLE COME FORWARD. PEOPLE MAKE THE A A IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BAR THE HOME THEY START PAYING THEIR PROPERTY TAXES ON THAT GARAGE CONVERSION THE ASSESSOR COMES IN IT AND THAT'S THAT AND IN THE CITY OR THE COUNTY. THE IT I'LL YOU KNOW DOES THE ARCHITECTURAL WOULD PUT IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE CIVIL YOU KNOW PUT A DOOR AND THERE WERE MAKE IT LOOK NICER SO SO WE INSTEAD OF SAYING YOU DO IT ALL UP FRONT AT THE TIME WE GIVE THEM A PERIOD. BECAUSE I AYE IT BELIEVED THAT THE M. FOR CLINTON MEAN THERE'S TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE SAY HEY I BOOTLEG THIS NOBODY KNOWS I EXIST WHY MY GONNA COME IN AND YOU KNOW LET THEM KNOW I'M. LEGAL -- SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHY OF OF GIVING THEM THAT TIME PERIOD UNTIL IT WAS THE PROPERTY TAX IT WOULD BE UP ON THEM FROM. A THIS POINT ON NOT THE TERMINATION OF THE PASSAGE E. YEAH THAT WAS A MAIN. YES THAT'S THAT'S THE BILL BEFORE YOU IS THAT IT STARTS WHEN THEY COME IN AND AGAIN THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM OUT THERE THAT THESE FOLKS ARE THERE AND IF I IF I MADE THEM PAY THE RETROACTIVE PROPERTY TAX NOBODY COME FORWARD. LA REGIS WOULD HIT SAY NO THAT'S NOT THERE'S NO DEAL THERE -- SO. NOW WITH THAT AN AMNESTY ARE MOVING FOR THE FROM NOW ON RIGHT NOW OR NOT BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT OKAY. SO ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION -- SO YOU KNOW AGAIN MY PERSPECTIVE HE AYE I HEAR WHAT I THINK I'M. HERE IS A DIFFERENT. SUGGESTED AMENDMENT THAT SOMEHOW THERE BE AN AMNESTY WHICH WOULD APPLY FROM WHEN THIS BILL GOES TO EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST TWO WHEN THE REPORT. GETS RESOLVED WHO WILLING AND WE AND THEY RENEW YOUR INTO WE CODIFY WHAT IT SO SO IN EUROPE IT WHAT YOU'VE SAID TODAY IS THAT IS IF THIS BILL BECAME LAW. BEGINNING JANUARY ONE OF NEXT YEAR THERE WOULD BE NO FEES THAT PEOPLE COULD. WHAT DID YOU MISS A PAL THESE AND COUNTIES COULD A CHARGE THE SCHOOLS WILL GET A THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR THERE WOULD BE AN AMNESTY PERIOD WHERE PEOPLE WOULD COME IN AND SAY? I WANT IT I WANTED -- I WANT TO COME LEGAL AND DO THIS THEN WE WILL BE RACING THE CLOCK WITH HDDS REPORT IF IT EIGHT CD COMES UP WITH ITS REPORT ISSUE SAID NEXT YEAR AND THERE'S LEGISLATION THAT WE TAKE THAT SAY. THE EXCESS RECALLING UNITS SHALL PAY. NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY AS A REASONABLE FEE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE AND CITIES ARE ABLE TO CHARGE THAT THEN JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT WOULD BE. WE AYE I'VE. GOTTA GO TALK TO LEDGE COUNCIL BUT THAT WOULD BE THE LAW THAT WOULD THAT WITH THIS LITTLE WINDOW WOULD GO AWAY AND IF IT WAS. ZERO THEN IT WOULD SAY. SO IF I CAN'T OF MY COMMITTEE SEPARATE MY ME WE CAN'T TAKE AMENDMENTS AT THIS POINT SITE WOULD HAVE WHAT HE AND LOCAL GOV SO WHAT I'M ASKING FOR YOU AT THIS TIME IS -- AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD REVERT BACK PORTION SO RELATE NUMBER TEN OF THE SIXTEEN THINGS -- BACK TO CURRENT LAW SORT SO IN OTHER WORDS THAT WE NOT. OR THAT THAT THAT WE NOT -- ADDRESS THIS FEE ISSUE HERE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS AFTER THIS COMMITTEE ARE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THIS I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO ENTERTAIN IT I'M JUST NOT WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS IDEA IN PART BECAUSE I THINK THE IDEA OF AN AMNESTY THAT START SHARING Y.. SOME BEARD OF TIME MAYBE THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR -- IT PUTS YET ANOTHER PART OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO FIGURE OUT THE AMNESTY PIECE WHEN THEY MAY HAVE TO REVERSE IT. LITERALLY SOME MONTHS LATER AND SO IT FIGURE THIS OUT ON THE FLY JUST DON'T THINK ONE OF THE ENTITIES PIANIST THESE PRETENDERS THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE MC FOR TEN YEARS WHAT I WAS SAYING WITH REGARD TO WHAT THE FEEBLE CORRECT. FIFTY THERE WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FEE IS OUT THERE WOULD BE A A INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO COME OUT OF THE DARK IF THEY KNEW THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY AN IMPACT FEE. A DEVELOPER IMPACT THE RAIN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A FOR A FOLKS WOULD GET THERE WELL. WE CAN CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION I JUST THEM ASKING FOR A COMMITMENT THAT WE RIVER AT LEAST THIS SECTION BACK TO CURRENT LAW. YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT GREATS RELUCTANTLY OKAY THANK YOU. ARE WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO PROPOSE A DO PASS. OUR EYES IT DEPENDS AS AMENDED. WITH WITHOUT UP WITH THE WITH THE AMENDMENT THAT WE JUST WITH THE AMENDMENT WE JUST DESCRIBED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THIS FEE ISSUE. AS THE PLAN IS THE BILL WAS PRESENTED THAT'S THE MAP THAT'S THE ONE AMENDMENT. THERE'S NO THERE THERE I I DID NOT ACCEPT THE OTHER AMENDMENT THAT WAS OUTLINED IN THE STAFF REPORT. IT WILL CROSS [inaudible] OKAY. CENTER MIGHT MY STAFFER MONEY THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE TAKEN AS AN AUTHOR AMENDMENT NOT AS A COMMITTEE MEMBER BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY. IT'S PROCEDURE SO RUSHING YOU TO TAKE THE AMENDMENT THAT THAT ISSUE ON FEES -- WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN. SECTION ARE IN GOD NUMBER TEN OF THE SUMMARY OF THIS THAT WE JUST REFER BACK TO LOSS OF STRIKE THAT PORTION. AND THEN WE CAN LIVE TO DISCUSSES ANOTHER DAY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU WOULD WANT THE AUTHOR TO TAKE THAT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT I WILL CONTINUE. TO TO WORK WITH YOU SO FOR PURPOSES OF TODAY I'M WILL HAVE THE AUTHOR AMENDMENT BUT I STILL WANT TO SEE IF I CAN CONVINCE YOU. OF THAT THE GOOD THE BENEFITS AND THE WISDOM OF HAVING AT LEAST A SMALL WINDOW OF OF NO PEACE OR LIMITED FEES THAT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE. I WITH THAT I'M WILLING TO UNWILLING TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION THAT COMMITMENT BECAUSE I'VE HAD FOR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT BUT HAPPY TO OF HAPPY TO ENGAGE AND AND AND I WILL SAY TO THE PUBLIC WE ARE LOOKING. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME CREATIVE IDEAS ON HOW TO ADDRESSES BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT IF. FEES IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS ARE TOO HIGH EVEN THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN CHOOSE TO ELIMINATE THEM ON THE OTHER HAND. BRING THEM DOWN -- TO ZERO FEELS A BIT ONEROUS AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE LAYERING ON SO MANY NEW REQUIREMENTS ON ATV SO WITH THAT I THINK WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT [inaudible] OKAY -- OR WITHOUT AND LESSER ANY FINAL COMMENT MAKE IT JUICE WITH. THE ROOM FILLED I AM. IN MY HEART OF HEARTS BELIEVE THAT THIS FEE THING IS THE LYNCH PIN THAT'S GOING TO THAT'S REALLY GOOD AND UNLEASH THE HOUSING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR FIFTH MEETING. TO DISCUSS TO DISCUSS THIS IS WHAT WAS MEETINGS WITH OTHER -- FOLKS TO TO UNDERSCORE THAT EVEN IF IT'S FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I THINK IT'S GOOD IT THE THE ADDRESSING THE HOUSING NEEDS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA ARE SO ACUTE. THAT -- BUT IT'S A LONG DAY SO. EDU HAS IT IS WE'VE EPSOM SOME SUCCESS AND MOVE THE WE ARE. OKAY THERE'S BEEN A MOTION WITH THE BILLS ARE SECOND.
