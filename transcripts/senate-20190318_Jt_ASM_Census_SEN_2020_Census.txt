THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE SELECT COMMITTEES ON THE CENSUS. WE'RE JUST OVER ONE YEAR OUT FROM CENSUS DAY APRIL FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY AND TODAY IS THE FIRST HEARING OF THIS SESSION AND THE NEWLY RECONSTITUTED SELECT COMMITTEES. THAT WERE APPOINTED BY SPEAKER RENDON AND SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM ATKINS. I WANT TO WELCOME BACK DOCTOR PAN MY PARTNER ON CENSUS MATTERS THIS PAST YEAR AS WELL AS WELCOME SENATOR UMBERG. AS CO CHAIR OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE IN OUR NEW PARTNER. THANK YOU TO OUR COLLEAGUES NEW AND RETURNING IT WILL BE SERVING ON THIS LIKE COMMITTEES OVER THE NEXT YEAR PLUS. AS MANY OF YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS WILL BE THE MOST CHALLENGING CENSUS COUNT CALIFORNIA HAS EVER UNDERTAKEN. WE'RE THE HARDEST ACCOUNT STATE IN THE COUNTRY. ON TOP OF THAT THERE IS AN UNPRECEDENTED UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF FEAR AND ANXIETY IN OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. ARE PARTICIPATING IN ANYTHING RELATED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO AN EVEN LARGER UNDERCOUNT THE NORMAL. FORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA STARTED PLANNING EARLY AND IS ALREADY MADE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN ACHIEVING A COMPLETE COUNT. THUS FAR THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR ALLOCATED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO FIND OUT REACHING COMMUNICATION EFFORTS TO ENSURE AN ACCURATE AND SUCCESSFUL COUNT. THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND THE STATE'S EFFORTS. IN TOTAL THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS -- PROPOSED TO BE INVESTED WHICH BROUGH TODAY'S COMMITTEES AGENDA. TODAY'S HEARING WILL FOCUS ON THE STATE'S CENSUS TWENTY TWENTY PROGRAM. THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY WAS TASKED TO WORK WITH THE AC WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT OFFICE TO DEVELOP OUR REGION COMMUNICATION PROGRAMS TO REACH THE HARDEST ACCOUNT CALIFORNIANS. TESTIMONY TODAY WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE SINCE THE JUNE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ALLOCATION. SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE CONCERNING THE PROGRAMS OVERALL FUNDING AND THE ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE TO BE GIVEN TO MAJOR STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS. AS I STARTED IT -- IN MY OPENING. WE ARE NOW JUST OVER ONE YEAR FROM CENSUS DAY SO WE NEED TO BE TRANSITIONING FROM PLANNING TO ACTION. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE TO DATE AND WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE -- AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY CO CHAIRS -- FOR ANY OPENING REMARKS -- AND THEN WE'LL GET STARTED. SO I SENATOR UMBERG. WELL I I COULD BE SHORT JUST SAY WHAT HE SAID. BUT BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR CONVENING THIS SESSION. A COUPLE OF THINGS. THERE ARE A FEW THINGS WE DO IN GOVERNMENT THAT ARE AS IMPORTANT AS IS MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE BOTH. PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION. AND ALSO WE PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES. TO TO FUND THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES OF GOVERNMENT THE CENSUS IS A CRITICAL AND I CAN'T UNDERLINE THAT ENOUGH CRITICAL. COMPONENT OF ENSURING THE THAT WE PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION AND THAT WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THE THAT WE HAVE AN ACCURATE. RENDERING OF THE COUNT SO THAT RESOURCES ARE ACCURATELY APPROPRIATED FOR US HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OF AND I'M SURE WE'LL GET INTO THIS IS IN MY VIEW OF IN INSIDIOUS ATTEMPT TO THWART THAT PROCESS THE QUESTION OF CITIZENSHIP. ON THE BALLOT I'M NOT SURE THAT EVEN REASONABLE MINDS CAN DIFFER THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT. ON THE CENSUS SO I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT BUT ALSO IN IN TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT I THINK AGAIN IS IS JUST ABSOLUTELY OBVIOUS THAT THE PERSON THAT QUESTION IS -- TO INTIMIDATE FOLKS SO THANKS AGAIN MISTER CHAIR FOR CONVENING US AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY CULTURE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD AFTERNOON NO I THINK EVERYONE HIS PRESENCE HERE I SPECIALLY WANT TO THANK -- LIKE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN HIS ONCE AGAIN THAT SHARING THE SIMPLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE CENSUS AND REALLY APPRECIATED WORKING WITH YOU THIS PAST. YEAR LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED WORK TOGETHER I'M ALSO EXCITED TO HAVE A CO CHAIR AT THIS YEAR ON MY SIDE AS WELL SO CENTER BURKE. I SINCERELY LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PARTNERSHIP AS COACH OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE CENSUS IS WEEKEND THIS CRITICAL YEAR AND WHICH WEHAVE ONE CHANCE ONE CHANCE TO GET IT RIGHT AND APPROACH OF SINCE THE STATE WHICH IS JUST ABOUT A YEAR OF WEIGHTS IN APRIL. OF OF TWENTY TWENTY I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE GOV OPS FOR THEIR CONTINUING LEADERSHIP OF THE CENSUS AND ALL OUR SPEAKERS ARE HERE TODAY TO HELP US KICK OFF. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN A CENSUS EFFORTS I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THE CENSUS IS IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE CONSTITUTION I STATES EXPLICITLY SAY STATES. THAT WE CANNOT EVERYONE WE CAN'T EVERYONE WHO'S IN THE UNITED STATES THAT'S WHAT THE CENSUS IS ABOUT IT'S A BEDROCK OF OUR DEMOCRACY. SO IT'S GREAT TO SEE SUCH INTEREST IN THE SENSE OF TRISTEN THE CENSUS HAS CERTAINLY GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY AND PEOPLE RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CENSUS. TODAY OUR GOAL IS TO LEARN HOW FAR WE'VE COME SINCE LAST YEAR'S HEARINGS AND IDENTIFY THE NEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT LIE AHEAD OVER THE NEXT YEAR. WHILE MUCH OF THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SENSES OUTREACH EFFORTS HAVE BEEN ARRAY BEEN DETERMINED RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT A CRITICAL POINT WHERE WE CAN STILL SHAPE EXACTLY HOW WE LEVERAGE. THE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES WHICH HAVE BEEN ALLOTTED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND APPROVED BY THE GOVERNOR AND NOW IS ALSO TIME TO IDENTIFY ANY GAPS THAT EXIST BETWEEN A CURRENT CAPACITIES AND OUR ULTIMATE GOAL WHICH IS THE COUNT. EVERY CALIFORNIANS SO WITH THAT I LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR PANEL I KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR MEMBERS -- HERE AT THE END IT DOES ANYONE WISH TO MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL. REMARKS ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THE CHEERS YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING. MY INTEREST IN THIS -- COMES FROM A NUMBER OF OF DIFFERENT ANGLES FIRST IS THE CHAIR OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS ALONG WITH OUR GREAT VICE CHAIR DR PAN. OUR API CAUCUS WITH THE INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY OF API COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE. ARE KEENLY KEENLY KEENLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT WE GET IT RIGHT AND THAT WE CAN EVERYONE -- BUT CERTAINLY TEN YEARS AGO WITH THE TWO THOUSAND TEN CENSUS WHEN I WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IN OUR CITY WE INVESTED HEAVILY ENSURING THAT EVERYONE WAS COUNTED AND WORK CLOSELY WITH CEOS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. AND BECAUSE OF THE PROACTIVE INVESTMENT WE MADE WE WERE ONE OF THE FEW CITIES IN THE STATE THAT DID NOT SEE ARE HARD TO COUNT POPULATION NUMBERS GO DOWN. AND THIS IS WHY ALONG WITH I THINK EVERYONE ON THIS PANEL -- WERE ALL VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ENSURING THAT WE GET THE RESOURCES TO THE RIGHT PLACES TO MOVE THAT FORWARD. AND THEN I WOULD SAY WITH REGARDS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE CENSUS WE KNOW WE HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL MINISTRATION. THAT IS NOT A SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AS WE WOULD NEED THEM TO BE AND AS ONE OF A MORE ALONG WITH OTHER LEGISLATORS. ONE OF THE PARTIES TO THE LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION -- WE HAVE AN UP HILL BATTLE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER ACROSS OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES -- TO ADDRESS THIS THERE'S SO MUCH AT STAKE IN WITHOUT LOOKING FOR TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIRS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEES TO GET IT RIGHT [inaudible] THANK YOU. YES I MADE A QUICK -- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEN OF THE FIFTY NINE TO SENATE DISTRICTS SOUTH LOS ANGELES. AND THE FACT THAT WE PROBABLY HAD THE WORST COUNT. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M HERE TO MAKE SURE WE DO NOT HAVE THE WORST COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOPEFULLY EVER AGAIN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT ONLY GET EVERYONE COUNTED. BUT GROUPS THAT ARE THAT ARE FEARFUL. SHE WAS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN GROUP THAT ARE FEARFUL TO COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND BE COUNTED. BECAUSE SOME ADVERSE THINGS MAY HAPPEN TO THEM -- I AM KEENLY AWARE THAT AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE -- WHEN THEY DO GET COUNTED AND THEN THERE CAN'T KEEP DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE WAY WE COUNT EXPECT? A DIFFERENT RESULT WE'RE OFF TO DO SOME INNOVATIVE THINGS TO GET THESE DISCOUNT UP AND I'M HERE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE AND WHEN I SAY PUSH THE ENVELOPE -- I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO BOTH CHAIR STATE -- I'M VERY -- KEEN TO TRYING TO DO SOME THINGS THAT ARE -- OUT OF THE BOX AND I DON'T CARE TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND LIKE IT WE NEED TO GET DISCOUNT DONE AND GET IT DONE RIGHT. RIGHT THANK YOU THANKS MUCH CENTER THIRD ROUNDS. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER. AND OUR SENATORS -- FOR CHERRY AND CO CHAIRING -- WHAT I'M MOST CONCERNED ABOUT AS WE DIG INTO THIS IS THAT THERE IS APPEARS TO BE A VERY? ORGANIZED DELIBERATE. OF STRATEGY AND PLAN TO NOT COUNT OUR COMMUNITIES -- THROUGHOUT A CALIFORNIA. AND OF THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IS VERY DIVERSE OR ITS API -- AND LET. AND AFRICAN AMERICANS. THIS IS OF THE BIGGEST CONCERN BUT IF WE'RE NOT SUFFICIENT NICE -- IN CALIFORNIA -- THERE WE WILL BE ABLE. TO RESPOND AND THE DRESS THE WAY THAT THIS ORGANIZED OPPOSITION IS TO DOING ACCOUNTS WHICH WE NEVER THOUGHT WE'D SEE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DOING THIS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU I'M I THINK THIS IS. POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SELECT COMMITTEES WE HAVE -- AND AM HAPPY THAT I AM ABLE TO SERVE YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY REMEMBER AS A YOUNG GIRL. WALKING -- NEIGHBORHOOD BLACKS WITH MY MOTHER -- WHILE SHE PARTICIPATED IN A SENSE IS BY BEING A CENSUS COUNTER SHE WAS A SEASONAL WORKER. AND WE WALKED UP AND DOWN BLOCKS IN BROOKLYN AND IN NEW YORK CITY -- COUNTING AND I DIDN'T. I WAS DOING WITH HER. BUT SHE TOOK GREAT PRIDE IN DOING THIS. AND SHE KNEW THAT IT WAS ABOUT COUNTING EVERY SINGLE PERSON SO THAT ADEQUATE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO THOSE COMMUNITIES OFTENTIMES POOR COMMUNITIES OFTENTIMES BLACK BROWN PORTER RICAN COMMUNITIES -- IN BROOKLYN. AND IN NEW YORK. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY UNDER COUNTED. AND SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO SHIFT THE PARADIGM. TO BECOMING A STATE WHERE WE ARE APPROPRIATELY COUNTED. AND ALSO BEING VERY HONEST WITH HOW FAMILIES ARE LIVING NOW. WE ARE ALL NOT JUST ONE FAMILY IN ONE HOUSE WE ARE DOUBLED UP WE ARE TRIPLED UP WE DON'T HAVE HOMES. AND SO WE WILL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT NEW TECHNIQUES FOR HOW TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT WITH HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH FOLKS IN A WAY THAT THEY SEE CREDIBILITY AND THE FOLKS DELIVERING THE MESSAGE. AND IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE TRYING NEEDS TO GET THIS INFORMATION ACROSS AND TO GET OURSELVES COUNTED WE HAVE TOO MUCH AT STAKE AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE SCARED. AT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING SEATS AS A RESULT OF BEING UNDER COUNTY. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE PRESENTATIONS AND PARTICIPATING IN WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S RELATES TO THE CENSUS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPENING REMARKS ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA BEGIN. YES PLEASE DO YES FROM THE RIVER. IN MANY RESPECTS SIDE THERE'S NO ISSUE MORE IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA THEN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS SO THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH -- FOR ALL THREE FOR BRINGING THIS HEARING TOGETHER TO LOOK FOR TO PARTICIPATING. THANK YOU. RIGHT. OKAY SEEN OTHER OPENING REMARKS -- I WANT TO WELCOME UP OUR FIRST PANEL. THAT -- INC LIKE TO INVITE UP SECRETARY OF GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY -- MARIBEL BACHELOR AND DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR THE SENSES JUSTIN HOWARD AND ADRIANA MARTINEZ STEP THE DIRECTOR OF OUTREACH AND TRIBAL LIAISON AND THIS FIRST PANEL BE DISCUSSING THE CALIFORNIA CENSUS TWENTY TWENTY FUNDING AND OPERATIONS WELCOME AND WILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE LOOK FOR TO YOUR REMARKS. YEAH OKAY AND SO I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND BEGIN -- AND THEN I SURE TO BE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AS WELL SO THANK YOU -- THANK YOU MISTER CO CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIRMAN VERY MUCH AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- WE'RE DELIGHTED TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU AS HAS BEEN STATED THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN WE CAN AND MUST DO IN CALIFORNIA THAN -- THE SENSES AND GET IT RIGHT SO GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME AND THE STAFF FROM THE CENSUS HERE TODAY WE HAVE MANY STAFF MEMBERS. RIGHT BACK HERE IN THE FIRST COUPLE ROWS. AND JUSTIN AND ADRIANA WILL BE -- WILL PROVIDE YOU A MUCH GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORK WE HAVE BEEN DOING BUT I WANTED TO TAKE JUST A FEW MOMENTS. TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE ACTIVITIES SINCE LAST JULY. AS YOU WELL KNOW THE US COMMERCE DEPARTMENT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED TO CONDUCT A NATIONWIDE CENSUS EVERY TEN YEARS. AND FOR THE PAST TWO CENSUS COUNTS THE STATE HAS CARRIED OUT A LARGE SCALE OUT REACH AND COMMUNICATIONS CAMPAIGN TO ENSURE A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COUNT. OF ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. I KNOW THAT I NEEDN'T TELL YOU THAT. THE OUTRAGE CAMPAIGN FOR THE SENSE CALL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS AS MANUEL STATED BY MANY OF YOU TODAY. WE ARE FACING A NUMBER OF UNIQUE CARE -- CIRCUMSTANCES ALSO THAT HAS BEEN NOTED BY MEMBERS. THE CONTROVERSY AND UNCERTAINTY OF THE PROPOSED CITIZENSHIP QUESTION. INTRODUCTION OF THE FIRST DIGITAL U. S. CENSUS SURVEY FORM. THE UNIQUE DIVERSITY DENSITY AND SIZE THAT MAKE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL ALSO MEANS THOSE SENSORS CHALLENGES WILL BE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT. WE ARE HOME TO MORE THAN 12% OF THE NATION'S POPULATION YET WE ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 30% OF THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERED HARD TO COUNT. LOS ANGELES AS IT'S BEEN STATED IS THE HARDEST ACCOUNT CITY IN THE HARDEST ACCOUNT COUNTY IN THE HARDEST YOU COUNT STATE. LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS ALSO ONLY SECOND TO NEW YORK FOR HOLDING THE LARGEST POPULATION OF HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THE NATION. AN ACCURATE COUNT OF THE POPULATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND POLITICAL REDISTRICTING. IT ALSO PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN MANY AREAS OF PUBLIC LIFE INCLUDING THE IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. WITHOUT A COMPLETE COUNT THE STATE FACES A POTENTIAL LOSS OF A CONGRESSIONAL SEAT AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND MUCH NEEDED FEDERAL FUNDING. FOR TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS PLANNING WORK STARTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN MOVED TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH IN JULY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT SENSES TWENTY TWENTY OFFICE WAS MOVED TO THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY FOR WHICH I AM THE SECRETARY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT LAUNCHING THE STATE CENSUS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN A HUGE ENDEAVOR. THERE'S NO PRECEDENT IN THE STATE. IN TWENTY TEN THERE WERE TWO FULL TIME STAFF AND THREE LOANED PEOPLE FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITH A BUDGET OF JUST TWO MILLION DOLLARS. COMPARE THAT TO THE TWENTY TWENTY CAMPAIGN WE HAVE THE FUNDS FOR THIRTY THREE FULL TIME STAFF AND A BUDGET OF A HUNDRED POINT THREE MILLION WITH FIFTY FOUR MILLION MORE PROPOSED IN GOVERNOR NUISANCE BUDGET. BUT MORE THAN A STAB MACHINE AND OFFICE WITH ALL OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROCEDURES AND FUNDING METHODOLOGIES WE ARE CREATING A REPEATABLE PROCESS SO THAT IN. TWENTY THIRTY MUCH OF THE WORK WE WILL WE ARE DOING NOW HAVE WILL HAVE BEEN DONE. THAT NEW TEAM. WILL HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS BUT NOT START FROM SCRATCH AS WE HAVE DONE IN SO MANY PARTS OF OUR PLANNING PROCESS. SO AT A HIGH LEVEL WE LET ME SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THEN JUSTIN IN ADRIAAN A WILL GOING TO FAR GREATER DETAIL. WE HOSTED TWENTY FOUR REGIONAL CONVENIENCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHICH STARTED BEFORE JULY AND WRAPPED UP IN AUGUST WE HELD THREE TRIBAL CONSULTATIONS IN NORTHERN SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND A TRIBAL WEAPON ARE. OPENED OFFICES IN SACRAMENTO LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO FRESNO AND OAKLAND. OF OUR THIRTY THREE FULL TIME STAFF WE HAVE HIRED TWENTY SEVEN STAFF MADE OFFERS FOR THREE MORE AND RECRUITING. FOR THE FINAL. THREE DEVELOPED OUR FUNDING METHODOLOGY AND ANNOUNCED IT ON MEMBER. EIGHT TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE SENT LETTERS TO COUNTIES TRIBES COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ASKING IF THEY WANT TO OPT IN TO STATE FUNDING. JUSTIN WILL GO INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW AM OR EXCUSE ME WHO HAS RESPONDED AND HOW MUCH THEY WILL RECEIVE. IF WE ISSUED THREE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL RFPS TO THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THE CBO'S. STATEWIDE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OUTRAGE AND PUBLIC RELATIONS LAST TUESDAY WE ANNOUNCE THE TEN WINNERS OF THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS RFPS. LAUNCHED WE LAUNCHED -- FIRST PHASE OF SWARD REGION RAPID DEPLOYMENT ONLINE PORTAL. WE HAVE BROUGHT ON OUR FIRST COHORT IMPORTANT PARTNERS THE COUNTIES AND WILL BE BRINGING THE ADMINISTRATIVE. COUNTY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ON BOARD IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. WE HAVE HOSTED FIVE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE MEETINGS. THIS IS ALL. AT THIS ALL IS IN ADDITION TO THE ROUTINE ROUTINE BUT IMPORTANT TASKS OF BUILDING A WEBSITE GETTING THE SACRAMENTO AND FIELD OFFICES SET UP. AND ALL OF THE LOGISTICAL ISSUES THAT ENTAIL. I AM VERY PROUD OF THE WORK -- WE HAVE DONE SINCE JULY THE TASK OF COUNTING ALL OF CALIFORNIA IS CRUCIAL AND I KNOW EVERYONE WORKING ON THIS EFFORT FEELS ITS IMPORTANCE AND IS PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A FOUNDATION FOR A REAL SUSTAINABLE EFFORT AND I WILL TURN NOW OVER TO JUSTIN TO GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I'M VERY WILK I WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANELISTS FINISHED THANK YOU IT WILL TAKE QUESTIONS ANSWERED POUND THANK YOU WELCOME. GREAT -- THANK YOU FOR HAVING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY JUSTIN HOWARD ON THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR CENSUS OF THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. HOPEFULLY EACH OF YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU -- HAND OUT THAT WAS A POWER POINT I WAS PUT TOGETHER -- JUST FOR SOME TALKING POINTS THAT I WANT TO GO THROUGH AND SOME DETAIL HERE KIND OF WHERE ALL THE ALL THE FUNNY THING PROPOSED TO GO. AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS -- RELATED AS THE SECRETARY HAD MENTIONED AS A MENTION OPEN REMARKS THE STATE IS INVESTING AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF FUNDING TOWARDS -- OUT OF REACH AND FOR THAT TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS THIS ALL STARTED BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS I WAS ALLOCATED TO BOTH -- OPR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MOST OF THAT WAS RELATED TO OUR INITIAL WHAT WE CALL THE LOCAL UPDATE A CENSUS ADDRESS AT THE OPPORTUNITY WHERE THAT. A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA CAN UPDATE THEIR MASTER DRESSED VIOLENCE IN THOSE ADDRESSES AND TO THE US CENSUS BUREAU WHY IS THAT CRITICAL THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE THIS IS AN ADDRESS BASED ENUMERATIONS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE CORRECT ADDRESSES ARE SENT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT. WHEN THEY DO THEIR -- CAMPESINA MAY DO SEND OUT ALL THEIR ON POSTCARDS WITH THE ONLINE NUMBERS THAT EVERYONE WHO HAS AN ADDRESS IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION. AND THE OTHER THREE AND THE OTHER PORTION WAS REALLY FAR INITIAL PLANNING. ACTIVITIES THROUGH OPR AND FUNDING MANY OF THE CONVENIENCE OF THE SECRETARY MENTIONED -- IN PART -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON NINETY POINT THREE MILLION WAS ALLOCATED BY THE BY THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT TOGETHER BASICALLY A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH STRATEGY -- AND AS YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE ARE PROPOSING ANOTHER FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO BASICALLY SUPPLEMENT OUR EFFORTS AS WIND AS WE HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE SOME GAPS THAT WE NEED -- TO FIND AS PART OF A IS TO DEVELOP A CALL COMMUNITY GAUGE UTILIZES TRUSTED MESSENGERS IN THE COMMUNITY YOU DIDN'T WANT TO UTILIZE PEOPLE LIKE ME HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE WANT TO UTILIZE. FOLKS WERE ON THE GROUND IN THE COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAD TO PUSH THAT FUNDING DOWN BASICALLY TO THE LOCAL LEVEL AND NOT CONTROL IT UP HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL -- OUR ACTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLEMENT THE SIX US CENSUS BUREAU'S EFFORTS AND THEY ALSO REQUIRE COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION AMONG STAKEHOLDERS AND HAVE SUCH WITH THAT COLLABORATION CORONATION WE CAN HELP AVOID THE DUPLICATES AND OTHER. OF EFFORTS BETWEEN ALL OF OUR PARTNER-- ORGANIZATIONS SO AGAIN OUR STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE THOSE RESOURCES ON THE GROUND WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT WILL HELP BUILD THAT STRONG BASE OF TRUSTED COMMUNITY VOICES IT ALSOALLOWS. FOR WHAT WE WHAT WE CALL AN IN AN IN PERSON IMPRESSIONS IMPRESSIONS BASED ON HOW MANY TIMES CAN YOU YOU KNOW REACH A HARD O COUNT INDIVIDUAL -- WHAT WE KNOW IS IT'S GOING TO TAKE MULTIPLE IMPRESSIONS ON THESE FOLKS WE CAN'T JUST TELLING ONCE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TELL IN MULTIPLE TIMES? IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE AND HOPEFULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE CENSUS -- THIS IS ALSO BY PUSHING THE FUNDING DOWN LOCALLY IT ALSO HELPS TO FACILITATE THAT CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE ENGAGEMENT WITHIN OUR HARD ACCOUNT COMMUNITIES AND AS WELL AS A WILL HELP BREAK DOWN LANGUAGE ACCESS BARRIERS WE THINK ABOUT IT THE LOOK THE OUT REACH THAT'SGOING TO BE DONE BY OUR PARTNERS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE AND THE CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND LINGUISTICALLY ACCURATE MANNER -- FEAR DOING OUTREACH TO A PARTICULAR ETHNIC GROUP IS GOING TO NEED TO BE AND THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY THAT THEY PREDOMINATELY SPEAK -- ALSO BY PER -- WHETHER OR NOT AND WE'RE GETTING BASICALLY FROM THE FROM THE FROM. ENTITIES OUT THERE WHO ARE TRYING TO DISSUADE PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE CENSUS AND BY HAVING THE MONEY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WILL BE ABLE TO BASICALLY ALLOWS FOR RAPID RESPONSE ISN'T HIS SHIFT RESOURCES WHERE NEEDED TO HELP COMBAT SOME OF THOSE -- DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS THAT MAY ARISE THROUGHOUT THE ENUMERATION PROCESS -- SO ON THE NEXT SLIDE YOU KIND OF SEE THE THE THE OVERALL FUNDING ALLOCATION APPROACH I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO DO HERE COME TO SPEAK TO THIS AND THE OTHER PAGES BUT THIS KIND OF GIVES YOU JUST A HIGH LEVEL CHARTER OF WHERE ALL THE FUNDING IS BEING. PROPOSED AGO AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS -- SO WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON FIRST IS REALLY WHAT WE CALL OUR GROUND GAME OUR GROUND GAME IS. IS HOW WE ARE TARGETING ARE HARD TO COUNT POPULATION SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHERE THE HARD TO COUNT POPULATION LIVES AND THAT'S DONE THROUGH GEOGRAPHIC BASED OUT REACH. AND WE DO THAT AND ONE OF THREE WAYS OR COUNTIES THERE ARE A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS -- AND OUR TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS SO THAT'S KIND OF OUR GEOGRAPHIC BASE AND THEN WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR WHO THE HARD TO COUNT OUR THAT IS THE SECOND KIND OF LAKE HERE AND IT'S REALLY. WE TARGETED ABOUT FOURTEEN SPECIFIC -- DEMOGRAPHIC AREAS AND WE ARE LOW A WHITE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO TARGET WHO THESE POPULATIONS ARE. AND THEN THE THIRD AREA IS REALLY OUR SECTOR BASE OUR REGION THIS IS HOW DO WE GET TO THEM WHO DO THEY ENGAGE WITH IN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT WE CAN. SO THAT WE CAN TARGET THOSE EFFORTS BASED ON WHO THEY INTERACT WITH ON A FREQUENT BASIS. IT'S UP HEADING INTO COUNTY OUT REACH TO DATE WE'VE PROVIDED TWENTY SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED FOR DIRECT ALLOCATIONS THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT -- COUNTIES ARE TO SERVE AS THE FISCAL AGENTS WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA IN THOSE COUNTIES HAVE ALSO BEEN GIVEN SPECIFIC INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CITY'S -- WITHIN THEIR AREA -- ARE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY IS PREDOMINATELY BASED UPON WHAT WE CALL THE CALIFORNIA HARD TO COUNT INDEX. AND IF THIS IS WHAT REALLY MAKES SOMEONE CAN HARD TO COUNT IT'S MORE THAN JUST ETHNICITY BASE THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT GOES IN THERE IT'S AN COM IT'S DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND. THEIR SPORT THERE'S FOURTEEN DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO WHAT MAKES SOMEONE HARD TO COUNT AND WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE FUNDING AS WE'VE ALLOCATED OUT. BASED UPON WHERE THEY LIVE AND WHETHER OR NOT YOUR CONSIDER HOW TO COUNT BY THE CALIFORNIA HARD TO COUNT IN THAT. SO ON THE NEXT PAGE YOU CAN KIND OF GET A SENSE OF WHERE OUT WITH ARE COUNTING OUT REACH WE HAVE FORTY FIVE OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO PARTICIPATE AND ARE STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN. ON WHICH IS REALLY GOOD THOSE COUNTY CONDOS THE LETTERS WENT OUT TO COUNTIES BACK IN NOVEMBER AND THE DEADLINE WAS IN EARLY FEBRUARY FOR COUNTIES TO GET BACK TO THE STATE REGARDING THEIR PARTICIPATION. FOR THOSE COUNTIES WERE NOT CHOSEN OPT INTO THE OUT TO THE OUTREACH PROGRAM IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING THAT JUST MEANS THEY CHOSE NOT TO SERVE AS THE FISCAL AGENT AND DO THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK SOMEONE MAKE THAT CLEAR WE DO HAVE COUNTIES WHO HAVE OPTED OUT. THEY'RE GOING TO PARTICIPATE WHERE THEY CAN SERVE AS THE FISCALLY THAT SO WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THOSE THAT THOSE COUNTIES WALTER I'LL GIVE YOU TO THE BIG ONES -- FIRST ONE IS SAN DIEGO -- SAND ACT HAS STEPPED UP TO SERVE AS THE FISCAL AGENT FOR THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT SAN DIEGO IS ONE OF OUR HARDEST TO COUNTY AREAS IN THE STATE. I'M WITH A VERY DIVERSE POPULATIONS THAT THE OTHER ONE IS I SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY -- WHERE THEY ALSO CHOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE THERE IT'S KIND OF TWOFOLD AS WE'VE REACHED OUT AND HAVE BEEN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CITY OF STOCKTON IN THE CITY OF STOCKTON IS STEPPING UP TO SERVE AS THE FISCAL AGENT FOR THEIR INCORPORATED CITY? AND THEN WE'RE GONNA WORK WHAT THEY AWARDED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION FOR THAT REGION FOR THE OTHER AREAS WITHIN THAT COUNTY. AND THAT PREDOMINATELY IS WHAT WE ARE DOING FOR ALL THE OTHER COUNTIES OPTED OUT IS WE'RE GONNA BE THAT MONEY WILL STAY WITHIN THE COUNTY SO WE HAVE ALLOCATED RESOURCES TO DROUGHT REACHING A COUNTY. WE PLANET STAYING THERE AND WE'RE GONNA DO THAT BY GIVING THAT THOSE RESOURCES TO OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THEY ARE TO WORK. IS TO DO THE OUR REGION THE COUNTY WITH THOSE DOLLARS. OUR NEXT AREA HAS BEEN A IS OUR NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL GOVERNMENT OUT REACH HISTORICALLY THE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO COUNT -- SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IT'S KIND OF A UNIQUE -- THEY HAVE A LOT OF UNIQUE CHALLENGES WHAT WE'RE DOING IS A VERY MULTI PRONGED APPROACH FOR DEALING WITH OUR TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATIONS SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE DIRECTLY FROM FUNNY FUNDING DIRECTLY -- TO THE THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL SERVICE AREAS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY GIVEN THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF THAT POPULATION DOESN'T LIVE WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE FUNDING SUBSTANTIAL -- CONTRACTS THERE ARE COMMUNITY BASED STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS TO TARGET BASICALLY OUR URBAN INDIAN POPULATION WHO LIVE OUTSIDE OF THOSE POPULATIONS WE PLAN ON EXECUTING MULTIPLE CONTRACTS TO MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS TO DO THIS -- OUT RESTORE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN ADDITION TO THAT AS WE WORK WITH OUR ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THEY WILL ALSO BE CONDUCTING OUR RATES TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS I'M FROM THE RESOURCES THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING AND THEN FINALLY AS WE LOOK TO OUR OUR REGION PUBLIC RELATIONS CONTACT WHICH IS BASICALLY. OUR MEDIA EFFORTS WE ALSO BE FUNDING SIGNIFICAN OUR EXPORTS TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGH OUR MEDIA -- EFFORTS AS WELL. AND THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES IS GOING TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE DIRECT ALLOCATIONS ONLY -- SO WE WERE PROVIDED THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND FOR DIRECT ALLOCATIONS -- WE BASE THIS ON FUNDING TEARS RELATED TO HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS ARE IN A GEOGRAPHICAL SERVICE AREA FOR TRY MOST OF THEM HAVE VERY LOW NUMBERS OF HOUSING UNITS THERE'S NOT A LOT OF POPULATION AND LIVE ON THOSE TRIED SO WE'VE REALLY DONE IS PROVIDED A LOT OF MICRO. FUNDING AMOUNTS FOR ASKING THEM TO HOLD ONE COMMUNITY EVENT COME SINCE IT'S TIME TO BRING TOGETHER THOSE TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY HOUSEHOLDS TO TALK ABOUT THE CENSUS. AND I'VE BEEN GIVEN THE FINAL ONE MINUTE SO -- THE NEXT LIKE CAN GIVE YOU A BREAK ON WHERE WE STAND WITH OUR TRIBAL GOVERNMENT OUR REACH -- AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE TWELVE TRIBES OF OPTED IN WE HAVE FOURTEEN MORE WITH COMMITTED TO OPT IN AND AND WARRANT STRONG CONVERSATIONS WITH ANOTHER NINETEEN TRIBES -- WE WE'VE WE'VE WE FIRMLY BELIEVE MOST OF THOSE WILL ALSO COME IN AT THE END OF THE DAY AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO REACH ANOTHER -- TWENTY TWO TRIBES TO GARNER PARTICIPATION. AS IT RELATES TO OUR REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE -- AS YOU MAY IT MAY BE AWARE THE STATE IS DIVIDED UP INTO TEN REGIONS AND WE MADE THOSE TEN AWARDS TODAY WE'VE PROVIDED TWENTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION TO THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND WE ARE PROPOSING ANOTHER TEN AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WHICH THAT ADDITIONAL TEN WILL REALLY GO FOR WHAT WE CALL OUR NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP PERIOD THAT'S REALLY THE CRUCIAL POINT WHERE WE NEED TO DO CAMPESINA DOOR KNOCKING. TO ENSURE PARTICIPATION IN THE CENSUS FOR THOSE WHO DENNIS RESPOND EARLY ON THE NEXT FIGHT -- REALLY GOES INTO THE METHODOLOGY THAT WAS RELATED TO HOW WE MEET OUR AWARDS -- WE'VE ON MARCH TWELFTH WE MADE THE AWARD WINNING TEN ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND THESE ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATED IN A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS SOMEONE MAKE THAT CLEAR THIS WAS A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS -- WINNING BIDDERS WERE CHOSEN BASED ON THEIR ABILITY TO PARTNER WITH A DIVERSE SET OF SUBCONTRACTORS TO REACH THOSE HARD ACCOUNT POPULATIONS. SO ON THE NEXT PAGE IT GOES INTO WHO THE AUTHORITIES ARE AND YOU CAN SEE THE AT TEN FORTY AS I BELIEVE THAT WAS IN YOUR NOTES AS WELL SOLVE KINDA. TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT OUR STATE WIDE CTO RATE OUR REACH WERE PROPOSING TEN MILLION FOR THAT INITIAL OUR INITIAL AMOUNT IS FOUR FOUR MILLION. AND WE'RE PROPOSING AN ADDITIONAL SIX MILLION AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT'S THE TARGET THE SIXTEEN ORGANIZATION -- SIX OF THE FOURTEEN SPECIFIED DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS -- WE PLAN TO MAKE THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND MOUNT ON FRIDAY WHO'S GOING TO GET THOSE INITIAL SET OF AWARDS -- I WILL SKIP OVER THE NEXT FIGHT IT HEAD ON TO EDUCATION SO ONE OF OUR SECTOR -- EFFORTS IS RELATED TO EDUCATION WE'RE PROPOSING TO GIVE ONE POINT SEVEN NINE SEVEN FIVE MILLION TO FORTY COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WERE TARGETING TITLE ONE TITLE -- THREE CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THOSE SCHOOLS WILL BY DOING THESE FORTY AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION DEPARTMENT WHAT WE'RE WE'RE GONNA CAPTURE 98% OF ALL THOSE KIDS WHO READS WHO MEET THAT CRITERIA -- OTHER SECTOR OUT REACH OUR OTHER SECTOR OUT REACH PLAN IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT WE HOPE TO COME OUT WE COME UP WITH THAT COME OUT WITH THAT FAIRLY SOON -- BUT WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DEDICATED OUT WREATHS -- RELATED TO UNION FAITH BASED COMMUNITIES BUSINESS INCORPORATIONS TECHNOLOGY -- AND INNOVATION AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND YOU'LL SEE THAT PLAN HERE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE WE'RE ALSO PROPOSE IN ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEDICATED FOR HEALTH CARE SECTOR -- HEALTH CARE AS WELL -- ESPECIALLY -- THROUGH THE WHAT PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF INTERACTION WITH THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE TARGETING -- IN THAT WILL HELP US REACH THAT POPULATION -- THE NEXT SLIDE REALLY STARTS GOING INTO OUR MEDIA CAMPAIGN THERE'S NOT MUCH I CAN SAY HERE BECAUSE WE JUST PUT OUT THE ART PIECE OR AN ACTIVE SOLICITATION MODE AT THIS POINT -- WE HAVE SIXTEEN POINT ONE MILLION A WERE -- ALLOCATED FOR OUR MEDIA CAMPAIGN AND WE'RE PROPOSING ANOTHER THIRTY AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUDGET YOU CAN SEE A TIME LINE HERE -- WE HOPE TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE WAR THAT CONTRACT AND STARTING AT THE END OF JUNE -- THE OUTREACH AND PUBLIC RELATIONS ARE P. REALLY FOCUSES ON THE CALIFORNIA'S HARD TO COUNT -- THERE ARE COMPOUND CONTRACTOR WILL BE REQUIRED TO WORK WITH LOCAL ETHNIC MEDIA SO THAT WE CAN TARGET THE HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE THERE WILL BE MESSED THIS TESTING AND THAT IN REQUIRED AS PART OF THAT CONTRACT. IN THE PRIORITY DEMOGRAPHIC AUDIENCES ARE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATIONS LATINO POPULATIONS ARE TRAVEL POPULATION AS WELL AS MIDDLE EASTERN NORTH AFRICAN POPULATION -- THE NEXT LIKE KIND OF GOES INTO SOME OF THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH RELATED TO ACTUALLY -- ON MAKING THE WAR THERE'S GOING TO BE A BETTER CONFERENCE HELD ON MARCH TWENTY NINTH WE WILL RANK THE BETTER THE BIDS AS THEY COME IN AND WE WILL ACTUALLY CONDUCT ORAL INTERVIEWS WITH THE TOP. THREE METERS AND THE WILL POTENTIALLY NEGOTIATE WITH ONE OR TWO BETTERS -- AT THE END OF THE DAY TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA. ON THE NEXT SLIDE TALKS TO OUR LANGUAGE ACCESS -- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A CRUCIAL PART OF EVERYTHING WE DO AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER LANGUAGE ACCESS IS AT THE CORE OF EVERYTHING WE DO HERE IN THE CENSUS OFFICE. AT ALL THE OUT REACH SUPPOSED TO BE DONE AND THE LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE MANNER -- OUR PARTNERS AS THEY DEVELOP THEIR MATERIALS WILL MAKE MAKE SURE THAT THIS HAPPENS -- WE ARE DEVELOPING STANDARDS THAT WE WANT OUR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS TO FOLLOW -- THOSE STANDARDS WE PUT OUT A DRAFT OF THE STANDARDS AND WE'RE EXPECTING FEEDBACK ON THAT DRAFT -- OVER THE NEXT -- FEW WEEKS DRAFT ONCE WE RECEIVE THAT INITIAL FEEDBACK AND FOR PEOPLE TO REVIEW ONCE AGAIN GIVEN THE CRITICALITY OF LANGUAGE ACCESS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. OTHER FUNDED EFFORTS INCLUDES A SET ASIDE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IS BASICALLY SATISFIED A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY ONLY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CONTINGENCIES EMERGENCIES WE PLAN TO DEPLOY THESE RESOURCES. DURING ACTUAL ENUMERATION PERIODS SO AS EVENTS UNFOLD ON THE GROUND -- WE CAN QUICKLY AUGMENT -- OUR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS THE DOESN'T RESOURCES WHERE WE SEE AREAS POP UP OF CONCERN SOMEONE TO MAKE THIS REALLY CLEAR HERE IS ALL THE CONTRACTS OR EXECUTING ARE BEING EXECUTED IN A WAY THAT ALLOW US TO BE VERY NIMBLE. SO THAT WE CAN QUICKLY AUGMENT -- EFFORTS ON THE GROUND IF NEED BE. ADDITIONALLY WILL BE DOING SOME STATE AGENCY WORKING GROUP ACTIVITIES THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE OUR OWN STATE DEPARTMENTS AND THEY'RE BASICALLY THE TOUCH AS THEY HAVE WITH THE POPULATIONS THAT THEY SERVE. AND WE'VE ALSO AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE DID THE LOCAL UPDATE SINCE IT'S THE DRESSES WERE ALSO PROPOSING A LITTLE BIT OF FUNDING FOR WHAT'S CALLED TE CALIFORNIA HOUSING POPULATION SAMPLE NUMERATION. AND THEN WE HAVE OUR MINISTRY OF COSTS AND WHAT WE'RE PRO PROPOSING AS PART OF OUR OVERALL OPERATIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE KEEP OUR MINISTRY OF COSTS NO MORE THAN 10%. AND WE'RE HOPING THAT OUR PARTNERS CAN DO THE SAME AS WELL. AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER -- TO OUTREACH EFFORTS AND TEAM.

SO THAT WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT -- I PERSONALLY LOOK FOR IN YOU KNOW REVIEWING OVER A HUNDRED RESUMES AND EVENTUALLY -- INTERVIEWING FOLKS IS THAT THERE. THERE ARE HARD AND THEIR SOUL AS IN ADDITION TO THEIR TALENTS THEIR SKILLS -- THEIR BACKGROUND. THAT THEY MUST HAVE THAT ATTRIBUTE IN ORDER TO JOIN. A TEAM WHICH IS REALLY. US A SELECTIVE OF YOU KNOW WE WE ONLY HAVE FIFTEEN WE HAVE ROUGHLY. HALF OF THE COMPLETE COUNT OFFICE SO THAT'S YOU KNOW AGAIN A PRIVILEGE WE WE HAVE. A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US -- BUT WERE ALL VERY MUCH PASSIONATE DOING AND I ONE ACTUALLY US THE TEAM MEMBERS TO STAND AGAINST A FEW OF THEM ARE HERE NOT ALL OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT IF YOU.

AND OUR FOCUS ARE THESE INDIVIDUALS THE PEOPLE. BEHIND THE LABELS IF YOU WILL -- THAT ARE THE FIFTEEN HARD TO COUNT DEMOGRAPHIC POPULATIONS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED. AND THAT'S REALLY THE FOCUS OF OUR PROGRAM. AND IT IS AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING -- FOR PASSION IN PURSUING THIS WORK ON THE GROUND AND ALSO VERY MUCH EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS GUARDING THE PUBLIC. TAX DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING INVESTED THAT WE HAVE BEEN CHARGED BY ALL OF YOU AND THE GOVERNOR TO INVEST A STRATEGICALLY ON WISELY AS POSSIBLE. IN REACHING. THE IN EVERY COMMUNITY ACROSS OUR STATE. TO ACHIEVE A COMPLETE COUNT AMONG A 100% OF THE INHABITANTS ACROSS THE STATE AND SOMEONE SAID BY CONSTITUTION. INCLUDING THE HARD TO COUNT. KNOWING THAT CALIFORNIA'S CHALLENGES ARE UNIQUE AND YOU LAYER ON TOP OF THAT THE UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THIS CENSUS COUNT. TWENTY TWENTY THE ONLINE OF DIGITAL RESPONSE THAT IS EXPECTED BY THE US CENSUS BUREAU SO WE'RE VERY MINDFUL OF THAT AND VERY LASER FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT.

THE CHIEF ROLES YOU KNOW FUNDAMENTALLY OF THE REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGERS ACROSS THE STATE AND WE DO HAVE -- FIFTEEN TEAM MEMBERS BUDGETED FOR AND THAT INCLUDES -- FOR STATEWIDE ROLES BUT THE REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGERS WHICH ARE REGIONALES SIGNED THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RULES ARE REALLY.

AND SO WITH THAT ONE TURN OKAY. MISTER JONES SOURCE. THANKS. FOR SO -- I'M REALLY CONCERNED SPECIFICALLY OF OF ABOUT MY DISTRICT TO FIFTEEN ACT ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. AND I THINK I MENTIONED TO EARLIER ABOUT -- REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT AFTER AMERICAN LATINOS NOT BEING COUNTED. AND I KNOW SOME OF IT'S JUST TRIVIAL OR SUBLIMINAL OR WHATEVER. BUT EVEN WHEN YOU PRODUCE A MAP LIKE THIS. NO NO WHO PRODUCED IT. AND WE'RE NOT ON THE MAP. THAT'S A PROBLEM. THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT WE'VE BEEN LEFT OUT BEFORE WE EVEN STARTED. SO WHOEVER PUT THIS MAP TOGETHER LEFT UP TO FIFTY NINE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I'M TELL YOU WHERE IT IS TO SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS. SINCE SOUTH LOS ANGELES. NORTHERN BORDER IS THE TEN FREEWAY EAST WEST BORDERS OF WESTERN ALREADY ALAMEDA OLLIE DOWN TO MANCHESTER [inaudible] AND SO. LOOKING AT THIS I KNOW YOU HAVE THE OVERALL NUMBERS. BUT I NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO IN MY DISTRICT. AND I'M I'M SAYING THAT NOT TO BE SELFISH BUT TO BE SELFISH FOR MY CONSTITUENTS. BECAUSE IT'S STILL. IT JUST DRIVES ME NUTS WHEN? THE INDIVIDUALS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING CARE OF US. LEAVE US OUT OF THE EQUATION. AND SO IF YOU'RE IN THAT WAY THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE PROBLEM AND REASON I'M ON THIS COMMITTEE IS TO MAKE SURE. THAT PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT ONLY GET COUNTED. BUT THE FUNDING THE RESOURCES ARE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED TO MY DISTRICT AND THAT WE'RE NOT LEFT OUT. YOUR LACK OF FIVE FIFTY NICE YOU LOOK ALL DAY LONG IS NOT THERE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. OBVIOUSLY NOT HERE. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR NUMBERS ARE THE LOWEST [inaudible] GOING [inaudible] FOR OUR YEAH.

ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THAT WILL PROBABLY GO IN THE NEXT TOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH INTO EXACTLY HOW THEY'RE INCORPORATING. SOUTH LOS ANGELES THAT IS. ABSOLUTELY TOP OF MIND I MYSELF AM FROM BOYLE HEIGHTS. SO I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR AND APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT THAT THE MAP THAT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT -- OUTLINES THE REGION'S AS MULTIPLE COUNTIES. BUT I DO KNOW THAT. G. I. S. MAPPING LEAD JIM MILLER WAS PART OF OUR TEAM HAS ALREADY -- BECAUSE WE HAVE WE WANTED TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL AT THE CITY LEVEL SO WE HAVE A BREAK DOWN BY. ASSEMBLY DISTRICT -- IN TERMS OF WHERE THE HARD TO COUNT ARE -- WITHIN EACH REGION IN A WITHIN THESE COUNTY SO WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH -- YOUR OFFICE AGAIN I BELIEVE CECIL FLOOR NóI FROM OUR TEAM OUT REACH TEAM HAS ALREADY STARTED THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR STUFF AT THE DISTRICT -- FIELD OFFICE THE POINT I'M MAKING IS I'M NOT IN YOUR DATABASE [inaudible] OKAY. I'M JUST SAYING. IF. ONE OF YOU KNOW ONE LITTLE. THING LIKE THIS CAN TURN TO ANOTHER LITTLE THING TO IN THE LITTLE THING AND THEN I BEHIND THE BALL. ADVANI BUT TRYING TO CATCH UP. BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ME IN YOUR LIST OF YOU HAVE MY DISTRICT IN A LIST OF OF PRIOR. I'M HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE DON'T HAVE LITTLE SLIP UPS WHICH COULD BE REALLY BE PROBLEMATIC AS WE MOVE FORWARD THAT'S ON TRACK YEAH THANK THANK YOU SOMEONE NUMBER -- SO I THINK I WAS A SENATOR ALSO -- AND THEN I'M GONNA GO TO SOME OF THE WORD -- CENTER CUT -- CENTER CABALLERO. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE -- THE THE TIME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND FOR GOING THROUGH THE THE STRATEGY UP TO THIS POINT HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS ONE IS. YOU HAVE THE MEDIA OUT REACH AT SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WITH AN EXTRA THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS CAN YOU TELL US WHAT. IT GENERALLY WHAT YOUR STRATEGY IS IN TERMS OF USE OF THE MEDIA. AND AND THEN NUMBER TWO IS YOU TALKED ABOUT HOLDING THE CONTRACTORS ACCOUNTABLE AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES MANY TIMES -- FOR GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS IS HOLDING THE CONTRACTORS ACCOUNTABLE. WHAT ARE THE METRICS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE TO HOLD A BIG IT'S A LOT OF MONEY GOING OUT AND IT'S GOING OUT IN A REALLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME -- SOME REAL WELL MEANING ORGANIZATIONS BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HIRING STAFF AND SO I KNOW WHAT I DO IN A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE SOME METRICS YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING. AND IF YOU COULD TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU EVALUATE WHETHER THE MONEY YOU'RE SENDING TO A PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION IS BEING WELL SPENT SPENT. SURE I AGAIN JUSTIN HOWARD HAD DEPUTY SECRETARY AT DEVOPS -- TO ANSWER THE THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION ABOUT MEDIA AS AS I MENTIONED THE MEDIA OF P. IS OUT THERE WHAT WE'RE PLANNING ON DOING IS. POTENTIALLY OR IN A PRIME CONTRA TO THOSE LOCAL ETHNIC MEDIAS THE IDEA IS THAT THE THE THE MEDIA THAT'S BEING DONE WHETHER IT'S OR MEDIA ARE PAID MEDIA. IS GOING TO SUPPLEMENT THE EFFORTS ON THE GROUND SO FOR HOLDING EVENTS OVER DOING OUT REACHING A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY WILL THEN LAYER ON TOP OF THAT MEDIA IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA AS WELL -- FROM THOSE EFFORTS -- IT'S HARD TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE PROPOSED WE'RE REQUESTING PLANTS FROM OUR FOLKS RIGHT NOW AND WE'LL BE EVALUATING THOSE PLANS AS THEY COME IN. AND AND AS MENTIONED WE'LL GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF OF INTERVIEWING THE TOP -- THREE FOR POTENTIAL WAR AND AND WE COULD ACTUALLY MAKE MORE THAN ONE WAR AND WE HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY THAT WE PROVIDED IN THE MEDIA CONTRACT -- ARE THEN WE ARE ASKED P. ASKS ATTY ACCOUNTABILITY KIND OF IT IS VERY IMPORTANT SOMEWHAT WE HAVE STRUCTURED IS IS DELIVERABLE BASE CONTRACTS SO ALL THE CONTRACTS HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT CERTAIN DELIVERABLES TO THE STATE. WHICH EIGHT RAWNESS TEEN ON THE REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGERS -- WILL REVIEW AND APPROVE SO AND IF YOU DO A DELIVERABLE AND IT'S NOT APPROVED BY THE TEAM IT COULD BE A REPORT IT COULD BE IN A CERTAIN ACTIVITY ON ACTIVITIES SUCH AS USING OUR STATEWIDE OUTREACH RAPID DEPLOYMENT TOLL HAVE YOU BEEN UPLOADING YOUR ACTIVITY WITH YOUR OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. AND THAT DATABASE WILL BE REVIEWING THOSE AND EVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THESE REPORTS AND THEY DON'T GET PAID UNLESS THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE SO WE CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON FROM -- FIGHT A HOLISTIC LEVEL THROUGHOUT THE STATE IMPORTANTLY TO AS PART OF THAT CHIP SEEN OTHER THINGS -- WHAT THIS IS GOING TO HELP SHIPS EXCUSE ME TO CALIFORNIA SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT -- WE HAVE FUNDED I'M SO WE CAN GET A SENSE OF WHETHER THE DOLLARS WERE WELL SPENT OR NOT AND WHETHER OR NOT OUR MESSAGING WAS ACTUALLY RECEIVED IN THE COMMUNITY -- SO BETWEEN OUR OUR ONLINE TOOL AND OUR QUESTIONNAIRE THAT WE'RE GOING TO DEVELOP AS PART OF THAT SAMPLE ENUMERATION WILL HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING THE COMMUNITY -- THE THE COMMUNITY THAT WERE TARGETING HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS. IF I COULD -- I I GUESS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS HOPING I'D HERE IS THAT. ONE OF THE METRICS IS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO. FILL OUT THE QUESTION THAT THE QUESTIONNAIRES OR THAT THEY DO -- DO WHATEVER IT'S REQUIRED WHETHER IT'S GET ON THE INTERNET FILL OUT PAPERWORK IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT. THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO HOLD MEETINGS AND TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND TO YOU KNOW. BE FRIENDLY SURE I MEAN WE REALLY THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE WE HAVE SOME NUMBERS. THAT HE REALLY INDICATE THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY DOING WHAT WE NEED THEM TO DO IN ORDER TO SATISFY HIS SENSES QUESTION OR NOT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I FAILED TO MENTION IS ONE THING THAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU WHAT WE'RE GOING. TO BE GETTING IS REAL TIME RESPONSES TOOL IS WE'RE GONNA LAYER IN THOSE RESPONSE RATES INTO OUR INTERACTIVE MAP MEANS THAT WE CAN SEE WHERE THOSE RESPONSE RATES ARE IN RELATION TO THE OUTREACH EFFORT THAT WE'RE DOING SO FOR HOLDEN EVENTS IN A CERTAIN COMMUNITY. HOW IS THE RESPONSE RATE GOING IS AT HIGHS AND LOW IN PART OF THAT IS SO THAT WE CAN THEN QUICKLY? CHANGE RESOURCES IF WE NEED TO ST HEY WE'RE DOING REALLY GOOD OVER HERE BUT IT'S SUPER LOW OVER HERE AND WE CAN WE CAN DIRECTOR CONTRACTORS. THROUGH THE PROVISIONS IN OUR CONTRACTS AND YOU NEEDED SHIP TO RESOURCES FROM THIS AREA TO THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE RATES ARE COMING IN VERY. BAD IN THIS AREA SO THOSE ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE MAKE TO MORE MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE INCLUDED. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. SANTA ROSA THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- COUPLE QUESTIONS -- WHAT IS THE TOTAL NUMBER TARGETED? OF AND WHAT IS THE NUMBER THAT YOU EXPECT US TO REACH. WELL I MEAN I I'M SURE YOU HAVE THAT NOT JUST FOR STATEWIDE BUT YOU MUST HAVE THAT FOR REGION'S. SURE SO WE WE CAN GET YOU THE BREAKDOWN BY REGION THAT WERE REALLY I BELIEVE THE NUMBERS ALL THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION -- HARD TO COUNT POPULATION WITHIN CALIFORNIA OFFICE ACTUALLY -- EVERYONE'S A LITTLE OVER FIFTEEN MILLION. LIKE A LITTLE OVER 50% OR LET THE IN ALL AND THEN THERE'S A FURTHER BREAKDOWN. BUT IT'S IT'S OVER FIFTEEN MILLION AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE FACTORS IS THAT OVER 27% OF THAT HARD TO COUNT. THEIR FOREIGN BORN SO IT'S ANOTHER -- UNIQUE CHALLENGE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE AMONG. BUT THE THREE OF THEM AT THE END OF TEN MILLION AS HARD TO COUNT. TARGETED NUMBER. THAT YOU'RE LOOKING. TO GET TO DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WHICH IS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CENSUS CORRECT THAT'S ENOUGH. OKAY ANOTHER QUESTION IS -- ON THE EDUCATION SECTOR OUT REACH -- I KNOW IN TALKING TO SOME FOLKS -- WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT CATION ON AS INSTITUTIONS -- ESPECIALLY -- K. THROUGH TWELVE OR EVEN YOUNGER. THAT WE HAVE OR INFRASTRUCTURE THERE. THAT IS VERY EFFECTIVE. OR COULD BE VERY EFFECTIVE AND I KNOW THAT PART OF THE POPULATION OF HARD TO COUNT I HAVE HEARD I UNDERSTAND. ART NOT COUNTING OUR BABIES AND OUR CHILDREN. SO -- I DON'T SEE HOW. A MILLION LESS THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR. COULD POSSIBLY WORK I MEAN IT SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE -- IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE WHAT ALREADY EXISTS. TO GET THE MOST OUT OF IT AND MAYBE THERE ARE OTHER -- EDUCATIONAL YOU KNOW MAYBE CARE PROVIDERS ON THE ANSWER BUT BUT CERTAINLY OUR K. THROUGH. TWELVE SO HOW HOW WOULD YOU. I KNOW YOU SAY CAPTURES 98% OF TARGETED POPULATION BUT AS SENATOR CABALLERO SAID. JUST. JUST SAYING YOU DID SOMETHING TO REACH OUT TO THEM DOESN'T MEAN YOU'VE ACTUALLY CAPTURED THE SO HOW CAN YOU. SPEND MORE TIME DESCRIBING THAT. SURE SO AS PART OF THE AT EDUCATION SECTOR OUT REACH -- I WOULD I WOULD KEEP IN MIND FIRST THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE POPULATION WERE TARGETING AT MULTIPLE TOUCHES FROM DIFFERENT GROUPS RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING OUR EDUCATION BASED SCHOOLS TO DO IS. IS BASICALLY -- LOOK AT THAT LOOK AT THE REASON WE'RE PROVIDING THE RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY THOSE LOCATIONS WHERE THEY CAN SET UP KIOSKS WHERE THEY CAN LEVERAGE THEIR PARENT RESOURCE CENTERS WHERE THEY CAN HAPPEN QUESTIONER SYSTEM CENTER STAY OPEN LATE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME IN UTILIZED. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MANY OF THE SCHOOLS HAVE RELATED TO BE ABLE TO HOPEFULLY GO ONLINE AND FILL OUT THE CENSUS FORM. WE'RE ALSO ASKING THEM TO REALLY DO -- BIG WHAT'S BASICALLY WEEK WE HAVE TURNED US CENSUS WEEK WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT AND DO AT HAVE ALL THE SCHOOLS AT THE SAME TIME CONDUCT SINCE THIS WEEK ACTIVITIES -- RELATED TO THE CENSUS AND WE'RE ALSO BUILDING IN -- FOR OUR FOR OUR SCHOOLS EFFORTS RELATED -- TO A CURRICULUM AND GROUPS -- SO THAT WE CAN TEACH ABOUT THE CENSUS DURING THE ACTUAL -- SPRING PERIOD WHEN THE CENSUS IS GOING ON TO MAKE IT -- FRESH IN EVERYONE'S MIND WITH THE WITH THE GOAL THAT IF YOU TEACH ABOUT IT NOW THEY'LL REACH REMEMBER IT FOR THE LONG TERM CONTINUE. TO PAY IT FORWARD AS THEY THE LONG THROUGH THEIR LIFESTYLE AND HOPEFULLY THE CHRISTIAN CAN THEN GET EMBEDDED IN THE SCHOOL -- OVERALL CORRECT THEM ON ONGOING BASIS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE. TO JUST DO IT ONCE EVERY TEN YEARS. THE YOUR MUCH AS A RUNNING PLEASE SIT AT THIS ONE NOTE ON THE ZERO FIVE THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR FIFTEEN HARD TO COUNTER MY GRAPHICS AND WE WE ARE BEING AS RESTORE RESOURCEFUL AS POSSIBLE WITH THE BUDGET THAT WE DO HAVE. BUT A COUPLE OF STRATEGIES ARE -- ALSO THROUGH OUR SECTOR OUT REACH. WITH THE HEALTH SERVICES INDUSTRY -- WORKING WITH -- FOR EXAMPLE DEPARTMENTS LIKE -- HELP THE SOCIAL SERVICE AND THIS IS THE IN THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL ADDITIONAL EARMARKED -- FOR WORKING THROUGH WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN PROGRAMS -- INCLUDING THAT CLINICS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THE HEALTH SERVICES INDUSTRY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND TERMS OF OUR PART OF OUR STRATEGY AND MAKE SURE WE REACH THE ZERO TO FIVE AND THIS -- THE THIRD OF FIVE OF THE CHALLENGE THAT IS PARTICULARLY PREVALENT AMONG LET THE IN ALL RECENT IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND ALSO SOME OF THE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER SO. VERY IMPORTANT WORK. OKAY I'M SORRY PLEASE MORE OF IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE. MAYBE WITH WE JUST CAN. NO TALK MORE OFF LINE BUT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S MATCHING. THE HARD TO COUNT AT THAT AGE. YOU KNOW WITH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING SPENT IN TOTAL SO. I WOULD JUST URGE. LOOK AT THAT AGAIN BECAUSE I IT. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND I'VE BEEN WITH THE CAMPAIGN SO WE SAY ON THE GROUND ON THE GROUND AND THEN WE SPEND. YOU KNOW ZILLION DOLLARS ON MEDIA -- AND WE DON'T REALLY DO AS AGAIN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE OUR SCHOOLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHILD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS OF A FIRST QUESTION IS -- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SPECIFIC MEASURES THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE OR TO BE IMPLEMENTED? A TO SAFEGUARD THE AN INDIVIDUAL'S PRIVACY AND DOZENS THERE'S A NUMBER OF DATA POINTS THAT ARE PERTINENT AND RELEVANT -- TO PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY WHETHER IT'S OF THE COLLECTION OF THE DATA ITSELF OR THE TRANSMISSION OF THE DATA OR DISTORTED THAT IT DATA. WHETHER OR NOT THE DATA INCLUDES TO CITIZENSHIP QUESTION OR OTHERWISE I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER YOU KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT AREAS THAT WE NEED TO SAFEGUARD AGAIN USERS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE OR A TO BE IMPLEMENTED -- SO THAT WE CAN -- YOU KNOW -- SHARED THE INDIVIDUALS OF THEIR PRIVACY BEING PROTECTED HELLO SIR. SO. THIS IS WHERE -- YOU KNOW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU HAS. IT ME THIS IS MY CONSTITUTION ABSOLUTELY I REMEMBER BEING PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND CAMPAIGN I WAS FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE CALENDAR THEN GOVERNOR DAVIS. THAT WAS AND STILL IS WILL BE. ONE OF THE CHIEF -- CHALLENGES IS. ENCOURAGING PROCESS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE CAN -- REASSURE WE ARE -- THEN HAVE ASKED THE BUREAU AND WE'RE EXPECTING TO HAVE -- YOU KNOW MORE TOOLS MORE COLLATERAL MORE -- WHETHER IT'S INFOGRAPHICS WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE BECAUSE THERE ARE DISTINCT NEEDS AMONG WHETHER IT'S A TRIBAL -- GOVERNMENT OR WHETHER IT'S A PARTICULAR -- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION ASKING FOR A DIFFERENT WAY OF REASSURING AND HAVING THAT LANGUAGE BUT THAT'S A PROTECTION THAT. BY CONSTITUTION -- IT EXISTS BUT IT IS ONE OF THE CHIEF CHALLENGES AND WE PLAN TO DEFINITELY GET THAT INFORMATION OUT HOW DO WE AT THE STATE LEVEL MONITOR WHAT THE GOVERNMENT. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS IS DOING THE RIGHT THING WHETHER OR NOT THERE DO YOU KNOW BASICALLY PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUALS. ARE. FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM IT'S NOT AN OVERSIGHT SITUATION BUT YOU KNOW WE AT LEAST WE NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AND HOW THEY'RE USING THE COMPUTER SYSTEM AND AND SO ON SO FORTH. RIGHT SO WE WE'VE ENGAGED QUITE A BIT WITH THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU ON THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY OF THE DATA -- AS YOUR WHERE THEY'RE THE ONES ACTUALLY DO THE ENUMERATION COLLECT THE DATA AND THEREFORE STORE IT NOT US -- AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE MAKING WE'RE GOING TO PAINSTAKING A LINKS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT COLLECTING PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE CONDUCTING NOT REACH. TO BUT HAVING SAID THAT WE'VE ENGAGED QUITE A BIT. SO THAT WE CAN HELP WITH THAT MESSAGING TO OUR COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS -- ON THE GROUND SO THEY CAN THEN RELAY THAT TO FOLKS -- WE WE RUN INTO CERTAIN CHALLENGES WITH THEM WE HOLD THE WEAPON ARE SPECIFICALLY RELATED -- TO DATA PRIVACY -- YOU KNOW THE THE WILLINGNESS TO SHARE ALL THEIR EFFORTS IS IT IS NOT NECESSARY THEIR FOR FEAR OF IF THEY MAKE CERTAIN THINGS PUBLIC AND THEY WOULD ACTUALLY LEAD TO POTENTIAL ISSUES OF PEOPLE TRYING -- TO SO BURKE WHAT THAT THE SAFEGUARDS THAT THEY WOULD PUT IN PLACE TO IT'S POSSIBLE TO FORCE TO BASICALLY GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR OFFICE TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON TO CUT. ON MONITORS SORT OF FOR LIKE A YES ABSOLUTELY AND WE WE LIVE LED TO SHARE THE PRESENTATION FROM OUR WEAPON ARE WITH YOU AS WELL CONTACT SECOND QUESTION DEALS WITH THE OVERALL PICTURE. HI IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PAST DUE TO PREVIOUS OUR SENSES -- ENDED UP -- IN UNDER COUNTS SO -- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THOSE -- EXPERIENCES A SPECIFICALLY WHETHER IT WAS IT WAS IT BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE ACCESS OR IN THE SELECTION OF COMMUNITY GROUPS OR YOU KNOW VERY SPECIFIC ITEMS FROM THE PREVIOUS TO OUR SENSES THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM. AND TO AVOID BASICALLY JUST I'M AROUND. SO I I THINK THE VERY FIRST THING THAT WE LEARNED WAS THAT IT. IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER OUTREACH WE DO IS DONE BY TRUSTED MESSENGERS THAT'S WHAT WAS LEARNED IN THE PREVIOUS CENSUSES THAT YOU CAN'T DO IT AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL HERE IN SACRAMENTO REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE COMMUNITY. BY THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THE DAILY INTERACTION WITH THE POPULATION THE ONES THAT THEY TRUST THE MOST -- SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WITH OUR CAMPAIGN IS MAKING SURE WHERE. FUNDING -- THOSE THOSE LOCAL ETHNIC COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO GET THAT MESSAGE OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE MOST TRUSTED PEOPLE WHEN WHEN SOMEBODY COMES AND SAYS HEY PARTICIPATE IN THE CENSUS AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE MYSELF. TELLING YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CENSUS YOU NEED THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO DO IT SO THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST AND FOREMOST THING THAT WE LEARNED IN THAT WERE TRYING -- TO EMPLOYMENT AS OUR STRATEGY HERE'S TO FUN THAT WHICH IS WHY WE'RE PUSHING THE DOLLARS DOWN TO THE LOCAL. YEAH GRANTED GRANTED THAT THE FUNDING SITUATION OR LACK THERE OFFICE WILL YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY FIRST AND FOREMOST BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT DIRECTOR FUNDING AS YOU KNOW THE NEXT IMPORTANT QUESTION. THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND IT'S ONE WORD DOLLARS. THANK YOU I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CBO'S ROLE IN HOW THAT -- I'M ASSUMING OF COURSE THEY GET THE MONEY AND THEN THEY'RE FINDING SMALLER CBO'S TO DISTRIBUTE THAT TWO WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. I'M FROM EIGHT AT CONSTITUENCIES STANDPOINT I CAN IMAGINE THAT THIS MAY CAUSE -- SOME CONCERNED WITH OUR OUR LITTLE NONPROFITS WHO MAY GET THE MONEY OR MAY NOT GET THE MONEY WITH AN ART ARE DISTRICTS SO THAT'S WHY I HAVE SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN ESPECIALLY. I MEAN I LOVE THE UNITED WAY SENIOR COUNTY YOU SIT ON THE BOARD -- I THINK THEY REPLACE BEING HAVE ONE OTHER NOW LATINO ON THEIR BOARD ON WHICH IS NICE BUT PROBABLY NOT -- FULLY EMBRACED BY THE COMMUNITY IN THAT SENSE RIGHT -- SO IS THERE ARE. GUIDELINES FOR THE CBO'S WITH THREE THE SEAT SMALLER CBO'S ACTING LEFT TO EACH REGION ARE THEY GONNA UP FRONT THE MONEY OR THEY THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TIME HERE IT'S ON PAYMENTS AND REIMBURSEMENTS -- SO AS OF RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NOT PUT OUT SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR THE SUBCONTRACTING FROM A CBO DOWN TO THE CBO'S. AND WE DON'T WANT TO INSTITUTE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THEM KNOWING THAT EVERY -- ENTITY WHO WE MADE IN A WAR TO MAY OPERATE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY SOUND SO NOW THAT WE'VE MADE THOSE AWARDS WE ARE NOT GOING THROUGH THE ACTUAL LEADING OF THE CONTRACTS IT'S GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE WEEKS. IN SOME OF THOSE THINGS WILL BE DETERMINED AS WE HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM -- BUT WE DO WANT TO GIVE THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO HOPEFULLY MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION ON HOW THEY WANT TO DO THE SUBCONTRACTING FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE. FROM EIGHT ORGANIZATION MATCH UP PERSPECTIVE -- IF THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE INTERESTED AND SUBCONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE AN ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION WHO GOT AN AWARD. I'M ADRIAAN IS TEAM WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO AND WE JUST SENT THIS OUT ON FRIDAY WE ARE WEBSITE AS WELL. AS WE'VE BASICALLY CREATED AN INTEREST FORM SO IF YOU'RE AN ORGANIZATION AND YOU CAN GO TO OUR WEBSITE YOU CAN ENTER YOUR INFORMATION FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION WHAT -- REGION OF THE STATE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN -- I IS THERE A PARTICULAR -- TARGETED -- HARD TO COUNT AS THEY THEN CONDUCT THEIR REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETINGS WITH AC BILLS THEY WILL MATCH THEM UP AND THEN BRING THEM TOGETHER IN A ROOM SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THAT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THEIR CAPABILITIES ARE. AND WHAT THEY CAN POSSIBLY FIND SO FOR OUR PURPOSES A WIN THESE RULES COME DOWN OR NO RULES IT SOUNDS LIKE NO NO PRESCRIPTIVE RULES -- WILL THERE BE SO IT AS WE ARE CONTACTED BY SOME OF THESE GROUPS A WHO DON'T GET GRANTS OR BE WHO GET GRANTS BUT THE PAYMENT IS NOT TIMELY OR THEY HAVE SOME DISPUTES ABOUT. WHAT'S BEING REIMBURSED BECAUSE I GUARANTEE IT LIKE THIS IS WHAT I ANTICIPATE HEARING -- WILL THERE BE SOMEBODY THAT WE WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH WILL THERE BE LIKE AN ARMY SPOKESMAN IN YOUR OFFICE THAT WILL DEAL -- WITH THE A CBO ARE WE GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR DIRECTLY TRYING TO GET. THE UNITY HAVE STAFF WITHIN OUR OFFICE SHOULD THERE BE PAYMENT ISSUES BETWEEN THE THE AT AND MINISTRY OF AN A COMMUNITY BASED ONE LIKE WISE VERSUS THE STATE. ADMINISTRATIVE -- ON WE HAVE A SCHEDULE OF PAYMENTS THAT'S LAID OUT IN THE R. S. P. FOR WHICH WERE GIVEN TO THE AWARDS SO PAYMENTS WILL GO OUT OF PARTY THAT SCHEDULE SO MEAN THE DELIVERABLES ARE MET -- SO IT'S WERE PRETTY UP FRONT TRANSPARENT ABOUT HOW WE'RE SENDING OUT THE MONEY TO OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WE'LL HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ON WHAT'S THE BEST APPROACH FOR THEM BEFORE WE LET THEIR CONTRACT AND WHAT ARE THOSE DELIVERABLES. IT'S IT'S BEEN FOR THE MOST PART IT IS WITH THE YOUR TD PLANS THEIR IMPLEMENTATION PLANS AND THEN THE FOLLOW UP TO THAT INCLUDING ALL THE DATA THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT. THAT WE WANT TO PUT INTO OUR STATEWIDE -- ONLINE TOOLS THAT WE CAN MAP WHAT'S BEING DONE FOR PURPOSES OF SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE WE ARE HOPEFULLY DEPLOYING THE RESOURCES CHOI AND TO WEAR AREAS WHERE WE SEE ISSUES AND I I THINK THIS IS REALLY TOUGH FOR ME THAT THIS IS A BALANCE RIGHT SO. PROBABLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE CBO'S ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE IN FILLING OUT THAT PAPERWORK BUT THEY'RE THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN ACTUALLY REACHING THE COMMUNITY. WE KIND OF HAVE A A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY IN THE COMMUNITY AND THOSE PEOPLE CAN HIRE GRANT WRITER OR SO THAT'S ONE REASON WHY WE WENT WITH THE A. CDOS BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BE THE EXPERTS IN PROVIDING ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT ADMINISTRATIVE CAPABILITIES TO HELP. THOSE SMALLER CBO AND THEY'LL BE CHOOSING THEM I'M SORRY THIS IS LIKE BUT THEY'LL BE CHOOSING THEM HOW LIKE BASED ON THEIR STAFF THEIR BOARD WILL CHOOSE WITH. IT'S JUST KIND OF A A BIG DISCONNECT I I WOULD THINK BETWEEN. THE A. CBO'S AT LEAST IN AND MY REGION AND THE ACTUAL CBO IS ON THE GROUND AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHO'S. PROVIDING ARE YOU JUST FEEL CONFIDENT THOSE CHOICES THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE MORE RELATIONSHIPS AND WE SEE. THIS IS THE A A REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND THIS IS WHERE THE REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGERS ON THE OUT REACH TEAM. REALLY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE AS LEADERS. THEY WILL HERE FOR A AND THEY HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM SOME OF THE SMALLER CBO'S. A WITH ANY TO REGION WHETHER IT'S WITHIN THE CITY OF COMMUNITY AT CETERA. AND SO THE RULE THE RPM REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGER -- IS FACILITATING THOSE INTRODUCTIONS ULTIMATELY FOR THE RPM WHERE THEY HOLD THAT THE PRIME CONTRACTOR ACCOUNTABLE WHETHER IT'S A COUNTY WHETHER IT'S A ADMINISTRATIVE CBO OR EVENTUALLY THE ONES WILL ANNOUNCE ON FRIDAY THE STATEWIDE -- CBO'S IT'S IN THE PROGRAM ELEMENTS THE REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE AND ANY OF THE STRATEGIC PLANS YOU KNOW FROM LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ACCESS -- STANDARDS YOU KNOW SPECIFIC -- TO EACH REGION LIKE JUSTIN SAID EVERY REGION AND COMMUNITY. THEY'RE IN VERY DISTINCT -- OR WHETHER IT'S A VOLUNTEER PLAN -- INNOVATIVE WAYS OF REACHING THE HARD TO COUNT FOLKS GIVEN THE UNIQUE ELEMENTS THIS TIME OF WHAT THE SENATE CENSUS BUREAU EXPECTS -- FROM DIGITAL ONLINE RESPONSE. AT CETERA SOCIAL MEDIA HARPER LOCAL -- TACTICS SO THEY'RE ELEVEN DISTINCT ELEMENTS -- THAT. ARE REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGERS WILL BE LOOKING AT THROUGH. CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH THE PRIME CONTRACTORS AND ALSO WITH THE SUBS EVENTUALLY WE HAVE BUILT IN A PROCESS WHERE THE CONTRACTORS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT THEIR MONTHLY MEETINGS. TO THE RPM ON HOW THEY ARE WHICH THE RPM WILL LOOK AT THOSE ELEVEN ELEMENTS AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON YOUR MISSING -- A CRITICAL LANGUAGE WHETHER IT'S MYSTICAL INVENTOR COUNTY AND CLEARLY THERE'S A HARD TO COUNT SIGNIFICANT POPULATION THERE THAT SPEAKS MYSTICAL AND THEY HAVE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT IN THEIR PLAN. WE'RE WE'RE GONNA PULL THEM ACCOUNTABLE -- OR RPM'S FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS AS THE TEAM HAS BEEN GROWING THEY HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT PRO ACTIVELY. TO THE COUNTIES THEY'RE IN CONTACT WITH COUNTY LEADS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT REGIONS -- NOW THAT THE A. CBO'S HAVE BEEN AWARDED THEY'VE BEEN REACHING OUT TO THE TO THE CENSUS LEADS WITHIN THE CBO SO -- DEFINITELY WILL AS YOU HEAR FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS -- AND THEN THE THIRD CALL THE THIRD ROUND OF CALLS OUR TEAMS HAVE BEEN BUSY -- MAKING ARE REACHING OUT -- TO YOUR YOUR DISTRICT STAFF. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY USE THAT YOUR STUFF ARE AWARE OF OUR PROGRAM AND AND MAKE SURE THE ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU -- NEXT UP WE HAVE. THIS NOVEMBER COLORADO. THANK YOU -- SO CAN YOU ALSO SHARE WITH ME AGAIN THE THE PRINTED AND THE DIGITAL -- MATERIALS WILL BE OUT. AND THE VETTING PROCESS FOR THE TESTING ESPECIALLY FOR THE DIGITAL -- REFERRING TO THE US CENSUS BUREAU -- SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS. AND LATE MARCH -- EVERYONE WILL -- NOT EVERYONE BUT THOSE HAVE BEEN SELECTED WILL ALL GET LIKE A POSTCARD IN THE MAIL. ON THAT POSTCARD YOU'LL BASS IT'LL BASICALLY HAVING A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER NUMBER FOR YOUR HOUSEHOLD -- AT THAT POINT IN TIME THEY WILL OPEN UP THE CENSUS TO OUR OPEN UP THE PROCESS WHILE YOU GO ONLINE -- TO HOPEFULLY. VOLUNTARILY FILL OUT THE THE CENSUS FORM -- APRIL FIRST IS THE ACTUAL CENSUS DAY IN AND OF ITSELF -- THIS PROCESS WILL CONTINUE WHERE YOU'LL GET DO YOU ACTUALLY GET IN THE MAIL THE FORM -- SO IF YOU DON'T UTILIZE THE ONLINE PROCESS YOU WILL EVENTUALLY BE FOLLOWED UP BY THE US CENSUS BUREAU -- WITH A MALE FORM -- IT AGAIN THAT'LL THAT OCCUR ONCE OR TWICE I BELIEVE AND THEN AFTER THAT IF YOU DON'T RESPOND TO THE MAIL FORM YOU'LL ACTUALLY HAVE SOMEBODY FROM THE US CENSUS BUREAU COME TO YOUR HOUSEHOLD AND ULTIMATELY KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR. AND HOPEFULLY GET YOU TO FILL OUT THE FORM IN PERSON -- THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS WHERE YOU CAN FILL OUT THE FORM CAN BE ONLINE YOU CAN DO IT VIA TELEPHONE -- OR IN PERSON -- AND EITHER THROUGH ONE OF OUR QUESTIONNAIRE SYSTEM CENTERS ARE CHAOS THAT WE'RE GONNA SET UP OR THROUGH SOME TYPE OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SET UP SOME PROCESS TO USE A TABLET. OKAY AND SO TO KIND OF FOLLOW UP ON WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER THÅU ASKING. HOW ARE WE PREPARING FOR DEALING WITH CYBERSECURITY -- FAKE NEWS -- YOU KNOW BOB SO I MEAN THERE'S A HYPERSENSITIVITY AROUND WHAT PEOPLE SEE AND BELIEVE TO BE TRUE ON SOCIAL MEDIA -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE PLATFORMS HAVE LESS CREDIBILITY NOW WITH CERTAIN COMMUNITIES SO HOW ARE WE PREPARING FOR THEM. SO PART OF OUR MEDIA ARE INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT RELATED -- TO DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS AND THINGS THAT GET REPORTED. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT SOME OTHER -- TECHNIQUES FROM A COUPLE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WE'VE BEEN CONTACT WITH THAT COULD HELP REPORT THAT INFORMATION MORE VASTLY TO US THAT WE CAN REACT QUICKER WHEN PEOPLE SEE. ON THIS TYPE OF CAMPAIGNS -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- SO DID MY FINAL QUESTION SERVE. GOING OFF OF THAT AND ALSO WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZWAS ASKING THEM IT'S ABOUT THIS NOTION AROUND TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND PARTNERING WITH CBO'S -- IN THE COMMUNITY YOU KNOW YOUR IDEA OF A TRUSTED MESSENGER AND MY IDEA OF A TRUSTED MESSENGER MAY NOT BE THE SAME. RIGHT AND SO AS WE ARE CONSIDERING NONTRADITIONAL YOU KNOW. CBO'S OR NONTRADITIONAL COMMUNITY LEADERS REACHING OUT TO THOSE FOLKS THAT REALLY KIND OF HAVE -- CREDIBILITY WITHIN COMMUNITIES. I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN HEARING. A LOT ABOUT THAT AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE HAVE UNINTENTIONAL THERE IS BIAS. IN WHO WE CONSIDER TO BE TRUSTED MESSENGER AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING AS SERIOUS. AS COUNTING EVERYONE SOMETIMES I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AND EVEN WITHIN THE SYSTEMS THAT WERE DEVELOPING THAT WE LOOK TO SAY. HEY YOU KNOW MY MAKING SOME ASSUMPTIONS. ABOUT THE KIND OF TRUSTED MESSENGER THAT I'D WANT TO WORK WITH SO THAT WE'RE WILLING TO CONTRACT WITH BECAUSE YOU KNOW ABC ORGANIZATION MIGHT BE GREAT. BUT POOKIE. MAY ACTUALLY HAVE THE BEST RELATIONSHIP. AND HAVE THE LONGEST TENTACLES INTO THE COMMUNITY BUT IN OUR EFFORT TO BE PROFESSIONAL AND OUR EFFORT TO BE KIND OF INCLUSIVE IN OUR EFFORT TO BE ALL OF THESE THINGS. ARE BIAS. ENCOURAGES US TO MARGINALIZE EVEN SOME OF THOSE YOU KNOW COMMUNITY GROUPS -- YOU KNOW NONTRADITIONAL. COMMUNITY -- STAKEHOLDER SO CAN WE KIND OF TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK IF WE'VE DONE THIS MULTIPLE TIMES AND WE'VE STILL BEEN UNDER COUNTY. THEN THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT WERE NOT DOING RIGHT THAT MAYBE WE CONTINUE. TO YOU KNOW WANT TO DO AND IT'S LIKE JUST I HOPE THAT WE STOP HITTING HER HEAD AGAINST THE SAME WALL. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THEM. AND ANOTHER WAS A LOT SURE. THOSE WERE ALL EYES AND EARS ON A LOCAL LEVEL REALLY COME INTO PLAY BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ALL ARE TALKING ABOUT. FOR US IT -- AGAIN BECAUSE WE WERE RELATIVELY LEAN AND MEAN TEAM WE DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE GUARDING THE THE THE DOLLARS THAT ARE INVESTED WE HAVE THE ADMINISTRATIVE CBO -- STRUCTURE HOWEVER -- THE MEMBERS OF THE OUT REACH TEAM -- WORKING IN IN YOU KNOW HIP TO HAVE WITH WHETHER IT'S MEMBERS OF YOUR FIELD STAFF THE COUNTY THE CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTIES BECAUSE WE ARE FORCING FOR EXAMPLE THE CITIES I MEAN THE COUNTY SO DEFINITELY EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T CONTRACT WITH THE CITY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THOSE CITIES ARE ARE INCLUDED IN THE IN THE EFFORT -- IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL EYES AND EARS LOCALLY. ARE ARE INFORMING US GIVING US FEEDBACK ON SOME POSSIBLE -- COLLABORATORS THAT WE MAY NOT YET HAVE HAVE AT THE TABLE I THINK THAT'S WAS ILLUSTRATED BY. THE FACT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRING THE CONTRACTORS WITH WITH OUR OFFICE -- TO CHECK IN. MINIMALLY EVERY MONTH REALLY IT'S IT'S ONE WEEKLY BASIS YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT -- IF WE HEAR WHETHER IT'S SOMEONE FROM YOUR OFFICE OR SOMEONE IN THE COMMUNITY SAYING HEY I'M I'VE GOT AN EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA AND I REALLY WANT TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS. THAT WE ALLOW THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT YOU KNOW MARRYING THEM UP WITH THE WITH THE CONTRACTORS THAT WERE WORKING WITH BECAUSE WE ABSOLUTELY -- WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALLOW -- THOSE -- OPPORTUNITIES TO HAPPEN LAKE LOCALS IS IT YOU KNOW LA HAD THE HOMELESS COUNT DATE FIGURE OUT WAYS TO BE VERY GRASSROOTS AND TO EXPAND THEIR REACH AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW I MEAN I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE ENROLLING FOLKS AND COVER CALIFORNIA. SO MANY CHALLENGES UNTIL THE ELEVENTH HOUR WHEN PEOPLE REACHED OUT AND SAID HEY AND IT WAS A SIMPLE AS COMING UP WITH AN IDEA LIKE PUT A KIOSK IN THE MALL. YOU NOBODY SHOULDN'T HAVE THAT SHOULDN'T COME UP AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR. U KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO. MAYBE I CAN EXPAND A LITTLE BIT I MEAN ALL THESE AREAS ALL THAT WE'RE MAKING IT WORKS IS ALL PARTICIPATE IN WHAT'S CALLED A LOCAL COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE. AND OUR RPM'S ARE ALSO -- ATTENDING THESE LOCAL COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE SO WE HAVE ONE AT THE STATE LEVEL OR GETTING IDEAS AND FEEDBACK -- FROM FROM WHAT WE'RE DOING BUT ALL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ARE ARE ARE AND THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PARTICIPATE IN LOCAL ONES WHERE THEY SHOULD BE GETTING THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHO IS THE BEST ENTITY. TO DO OUTREACH TO THE SPECIFIC GROUP AND OUR AREA IN DOING THAT THAT AIM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'RE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE AT THE STATE LEVEL JUST FOR THE REASON THAT YOU MENTIONED IS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA KNOW KNOWING US WE TYPICALLY PUT A LOT. OF REALLY STRICT REQUIREMENTS ON THINGS BUT WE WANT THEM TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT BETTING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHAT WHO IS THE BEST ORGANIZATION TO DO THAT OUT REACH -- WE CAN'T PRESCRIBE THAT HERE SO THAT WE CAN BE AS HELPFUL AS POSSIBLE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE RIGHT INFORMATION IS GETTING TO THE RIGHT GROUPS IN OUR DISTRICT. THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL THE OTHER THING. I THINK YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT BANGING OUR HEADS AGAINST THE SAME WALL WE HAVE NEW TOOLS THIS YEAR THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE. THEY'RE MUCH MORE PRECISE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS -- OF THE HARD TO COUNT AREAS SO WE CAN RAPIDLY DEPLOY PEOPLE ONCE WE HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING IS ANYTHING ON IT AND JUSTIN HAVE DESCRIBED THE PROCESS IF WE ARE. LEARNING THROUGH THE DATA COLLECTION THAT THERE ARE AND THROUGH OUR COORDINATION WITH OUR OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS THAT WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE OF MISTRUST OR OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING WE CAN RAPIDLY DEPLOY. INTO THOSE AREAS THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS TO COLLECT THAT AT TO HELP -- ORGANIZE THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLDS OR PEOPLE AND MAKE SURE WHETHER TO HOMELESS AREA OR AT AND NEIGHBORHOOD -- WE WILL DEPLOY THE THE I COORDINATED EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN PEOPLE WITH FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT ARE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT ACCOUNT. THANK YOU YOU HAVE NEW TOOLS BUT YOU ALSO HAVE NEW DANGERS SO YES WE DO DARK MEDIA IS VERY FRIGHTENING. AND WE WE'RE GOING TO DO RAPID DEPLOYMENT AROUND OUR MEDIA IS WELL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER I'M BURKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST FEW QUESTIONS. HOW LONG DO YOU ANTICIPATE WILL TAKE AN INDIVIDUAL FILL OUT A FORM? WE'VE I THINK THE CENSUS OFFICES -- WAS IT TEN MINUTES WELL. WE ONLY US AND OUR COMMITTEE ASKED THAT AT A RECENT QUARTERLY MEETING AND THE ESTIMATE IS FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES -- WE'VE ALSO LEARNED FROM THE BUREAU THAT -- ONE MUST COMPLETE THE ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE AND ONE SITTING IN OTHER WORDS. IT'S NOT A PROCESS WHERE ONE CAN SIT AND STARTED SAVE IT AND COME BACK TO IT LATER SO IT HAS TO BE COMPLETED. ONCE SO IF IT TAKES IN. SO IT TAKES TWENTY ABOUT HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD IS THERE IS A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME IF YOUR HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD LET'S SAY YOU'VE GOT THE HOUSEHOLD WITH FOUR MEMBERS HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE. THE SENSE OF THIS SO I I THINK THEY GIVE US AN AVERAGE SO IT'S SOME ORGAN SOMERBY QUICKER SUMMER BE LONGER JUST DEPENDING HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD SO SOMEWHERE AROUND. WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE AVERAGE FIFTEEN MINUTES I TENANTS -- INFORMED US WAS FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES. OKAY -- DEPEND ON HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE HOUSEHOLD UHHUH. THAT SOUNDS KIND ALONG TO ME -- ALL RIGHT SO IN TERMS OF THE ONLINE. APPLICATIONS ARE THEY THE PROCESS BEING TESTED RIGHT NOW NOT THAT THERE'S EVER BEEN NINETY ISSUE WITH THE GOVERNMENTAL. BILL OR ORGANIZATION JUST CURIOUS -- SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE THEIR ONLINE TESTING BUT I MEAN I WOULD NEED TO GET A SPECIFIC RESPONSE FROM THEM THEY'RE THE ONES ACTUALLY ARE DOING THE ENUMERATION PROCESS AND DOING ALL THAT THEY DID A A COMPREHENSIVE -- FEEL PASSED AND I BELIEVE IT WAS SOMEWHERE IN DELAWARE IT WAS IN PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND IT'S A SINGLE LOCATION WHERE THEY HAVE TESTED. OKAY AT ARE THEY GONNA TESTING CALIFORNIA AT ALL [inaudible] NOW [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. IN -- IN ORDER TO I THINK THERE'S CONSENSUS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE IS ACCURATE ACCOUNT AS IS HUMANLY POSSIBLE OR EVEN ELECTRONICALLY POSSIBLE -- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE NEED AS LAWMAKERS TO DO TO FACILITATE THAT SO FORGET EXAMPLE THIS. IS ONE ONE EXAMPLE SCHOOLS -- ANYTHING WE NEED TO CHANGE THE CODE. TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO BE ABLE -- TO FOR EXAMPLE IN PARENT TEACHER NIGHT MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE'RE COUNTING EVERYBODY. WILL SAY ONE THING. TO ONE WHERE WE HAVE COMMITTED ALREADY TO SOME OF YOUR STUFF -- WITH BECAUSE WE HAVE HEARD FROM A FEW LEGISLATORS ALSO. THAT WE WILL PROVIDE -- TALKING POINTS THAT YOU MAY INSERT AND WE WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO INSERT IN ANY FORM OR PUBLIC SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT WHETHER IT'S AT A SCHOOL. TO JUST START TO EDUCATE AND IMPRESS UPON YOUR CONSTITUENTS THE IMPORTANT. THAT THAT'S THE THAT I APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE QUESTION I'M ASKING SO IS THERE SOME CHANGE IN THE LAW. THAT NEEDS TO BE ME I I GET THE WILL GET TALKING POINTS AND WE SHOULD BE. PROSELYTISING IT WILL DO THAT SO IS THERE ANYTHING IN LAW THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED I GOT YOU I ALSO GOT MORE RESOURCES PART I GOT THAT PART BUT I'M AWARE OF AND THEN YOU NEED. FOR FOR ANY KIND OF CHANGE IN STATUTE -- THAT WOULD ENGAGE THE LEGISLATURE ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN I THINK IT WAS WONDERFUL THAT YOU ALL APPOINTED A PERSON AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL TO BE A CENSUS POINT OF CONTACT THAT WAS ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL TO US -- AS WELL AS HAVE SOMEBODY HERE INSTEAD REACH OUT TO BUT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY -- STATUTORY CHANGE THAT HAS COME UP IN ANY OF OUR CONVERSATIONS EITHER WITH THE BUREAU OR WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE -- NOT AWARE OF SO FOR EXAMPLE CONDITION OF ENROLLMENT AND ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES OF CALIFORNIA WHEN THE CAMPUSES. IS IT OKAY IF WE ASK IS A CONDITION ONE MOMENT. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU'VE BEEN PARTICIPATED IN THE CENSUS OF BEEN ENUMERATED. POLLY HANSON YOU KNOW WHAT IT WILL TAKE YOUR COMMON APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF DEVELOPING THE HIGHER END. ENGAGEMENT -- OUR SELF IS OUR SERVICE ALL RELATIVELY NEW WE FULLY DEVELOPED THE K. THROUGH TWELVE YOU KNOW JUST TO MENTION THE INVESTMENT IN THE FUNDING I'M FORTY COUNTY OFFICES OF IT ACROSS THE STATE. THE HIGHER EDUCATION PIECE WE ARE. WE ARE STILL. DEVELOPING AND FINALIZING. SOMEONE TO TAKE YOUR QUESTION I YOUR COMMENT AND HAVE OUR TEAM. LOOK INTO THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION YEAH THERE'S A SUGGESTION WE WE SENT DEVICES BY LOWERING TUITION -- I I'LL JUST SAY AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT THERE'S GREAT IF THERE'S IDEAS OUT THERE THAT YOU HEAR THAT WE HAVE IN HERE WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT THOSE IDEAS ARE SO THAT WE CAN TAKE THEM INTO CONSIDERATION AND HOW WOULD THAT WORK AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING -- YOU HEAR ABOUT IDEAS YOU KNOW I WIN RIGHT OKAY SIX FLOOR. I KNOW YOU'VE THOUGHT THROUGH THIS. ANY. CONTACTED WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN. AND IF WE CAN WHETHER WE WANT. TO FOR EXAMPLE GETTING A DRIVER'S LICENSE TO WE WANT TO MAKE THAT PART OF GETTING A DRIVER'S LICENSE HAVE YOU PARTICIPATE IN THE CENSUS I REALIZE IT'S A SENSITIVE ISSUE. BUT IT'S NOT MORE SENSITIVE THAN THAN THAN THE THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION WE WE'VE I FIND THAT TO BE INSIDIOUS THAT DOESN'T CITIZENSHIP QUESTION POTENTIALLY ON THE BALLOT BUT BUT WE WANT TO COUNT EVERYBODY. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WHETHER WE EXPLORED ALL LEGITIMATE. WAYS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE GETS COUNTED BUT NOT. NOT NOT INTIMIDATE ANYBODY. I THINK THE ONE THING WE HAVE CONSIDERED AND THOUGHT THROUGH AND TALKED ABOUT. ALMOST SINCE THE BEGINNING WHEN CENSUSES MOVED INTO GOV OPS IS USING STATE ENTITIES THAT ARE THE TOUCH POINTS I THINK A DROWNING MENTIONED WITH FOR EXAMPLE. THE OTHER IMPORTANT TOUCH POINTS THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. TOUCH SERVE GOVERNMENT SERVICES FOR IS TO USE THEM AS INFORMATION -- SOURCES SO NOT NOT ASKING BUT PUSHING OUT INFORMATION HOW IMPORTANT CENSUSES HOW IMPORTANT THEIR PARTICIPATION IS -- THAT WE INDEED WILL DO. OKAY I GOT THANKS I GOT THE CARROT PART OF CENTER PAN. THANKS VERY MUCH AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR RESPONSES SORT QUESTIONS -- SHOWS THINKING LIKE IT'S APRIL WE SHOULD GIVE HER ONE LIKE A DOLLAR TAX DEDUCTION FOR THE FINAL ON THE STATE TAXES. OKAY SAME TIME -- SO I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- WE'VE -- PROP IS TOTALLY OF COURSE THIS IS THE U. S. CENSUS WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN EVERYONE CALIFORNIA BUT WE HAVE TO INTERFACE WITH THE U. S. AT THIS OFFICE. I KNOW THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE SOME REMARKS ABOUT -- I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT MINISTRATION -- MAYBE SELLING SOME THIS TRUSTS -- IN BOTH -- THOSE DIRECTLY IN ACTIONS TO CENSUS RELATION THIS AS A QUESTION BUT ALSO INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE TYPE OF RHETORIC WE ALSO KNOW THOUGH THAT -- THE CENSUS BUREAU PROFESSIONALS WHO ACTUALLY STAFF TO BURROW I THINK ARE VERY DEDICATED AND AND WANT TO SEE A SUCCESSFUL SENSES THAT IS CONSTITUTIONAL -- BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION THOUGH IS WITH THE CENSUS OFFICE. DO YOU FEEL THAT -- GIVEN YOUR ACTIVITIES RIGHT NOW IS THIS IS THIS SOMETHING WHERE POLICE. ANTICIPATES ANY CHALLENGES IN TERMS OUR INTERFACE WITH THE CENSUS OFFICE ARE -- IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF RAPID FEEDBACK YOU GET A D. ESPECIALLY WHEN CENSUS TIME COMES AROUND I MEAN. WE'RE TALKING AND IT'S LIKE A CAMPAIGN RIGHT AND SO YOU'RE THAT LASTED IS THAT LAST MONTH BEFORE ELECTION DAY WHEN EVERYONE'S GOT TO MAIL IN BALLOTS IN NEEDHAM WITH THE TURN IT IN RIGHT SO YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME. TO MESS AROUND LOOKING TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U. S. CENSUS OFFICE. YES THE THE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US CENSUS BUREAU REGIONAL OF THE WHOLE WESTERN REGIONAL TEAM -- IS EXCELLENT YOU KNOW WE ARE HIP TO HIP WE LIKE TO DESCRIBE IT WE HAVE TO BE. WE JUST HAD A JOINT OF FIRST STREET TO STRATEGIC MEETING LAST WEEK. FOUR DAYS AGO HERE IN SACRAMENTO WITH THEIR THEIR NEWLY HIRED -- OUTREACH COORDINATOR SO OVERSEE THE PARTNERSHIP SPECIALISTS AND THEY'RE ALSO STILL GROWING. YEAH I'VE GOT TO PEOPLE MORE TO HIRE THEY HAVE OF A HANDFUL MORE. AND OF COURSE THEN THEY'LL GET. HUNDREDS OF ENUMERATORS AND WE WILL BE HAVING MORE THAN JOINT MEETINGS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO COORDINATE HOW TO COLLABORATE HOW. TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR FOR OUR PURPOSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE ABSOLUTELY -- THROUGH OUR ACTORS BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IS A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT HOW WILL THEY HELP FACILITATE MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS. SOME OF THESE NEWLY TRUSTED MESSENGERS FOLKS -- IN THE COMMUNITY. HAVE A SHOT AT THESE THE US CENSUS BUREAU JOBS AS THE NUMERATORS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS. SO IT'S IT'S EXCELLENT AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL BEHIND ALL THAT BUT JUST TO SAY THAT. THEIR HANDS A LITTLE BIT TIED IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY SAY IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON DC. AT THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL. AND IN TERMS OF IT WOULD YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT JUSTIN MESSENGERS AND SO FORTH -- YEAH -- YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS CERTAINLY DID PORTENTS OF THE REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGERS -- BUT I THINK WHAT YOU HEAR IS -- YOU AND GET YOU KNOW THE REGIONAL THE AC -- BUT TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO THAT THEY'RE TOUCHING EVERYONE AND I KNOW THAT ONE THE CHALLENGES I THINK SOME PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IS IS THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT HAPPENS USING IN A CBO IS AN INTERFACE BECAUSE OF THE STATE. WE HAVE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE ON OUR MONEY APPRECIATE ACCOUNTABILITY PART AND CERTAINLY I WANT PEOPLE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE BUT ALSO WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE. THE ELSE SO MY COLLEAGUES RAY MENTIONED -- EFFECTIVE PEOPLE MAY NOT BE PEOPLE WHO HAVE OUT ITS THEY DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW -- THEY MEAN I'D BE YOU KNOW THEY MEAN I'VE IN THAT YOU KNOW HAVE SOME KIND OF TAX STATUS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT COULD BE AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT OUR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. AND HOW TO BE SURE WE GET DOWN TO THAT AND ACTUALLY FRANKLY ALSO ON THE MEDIA SIDE. RIGHT -- SO YOU KNOW YOU START TALKING OKAY GREAT THE BIG MEDIA COMPANIES EASY YOU START DRILLING DOWN WEDNESDAY AT THE MEDIA WHAT YOU MEAN BY ETHNIC MEDIA RIGHT AND AND SO WE REALLY DOWN OR MEDIA THING. AGAIN AND SO I'M HOPING IS IS THAT MAYBE YOU CAN JUST TOUCH ON IT TO DO IT YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE DISTRICT OFFICES SO WE DON'T KNOW EVERYBODY BUT THEY KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE -- AND CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGERS TO BUT THE GREEN THAT -- THERE COULD BE SOME KIND OF REQUIREMENT THAT IS THEY'RE DOING TO MEDIA BUYS AND THEY'RE ON THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEY'RE DOING THAT OUR REACH THAT THEY ACTUALLY CHECK IN AND THAT WE GET INPUTS ARE DISTRICT OFFICES GET INPUT INTO BE SURE THAT THEY'VE. GOT THEY'VE ACTUALLY HAD PEOPLE THAT MAYBE OUR DISTRICT OFFICES OF WORKED WITH A NO THROUGH. DIFFERENT THINGS THAT -- THAT -- WE HAD THAT WE GET SOUTH BEACH SO IS THAT SOME ANSWERING ABSOLUTELY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE MEDIA BUT I'LL SPEAK TO THE ON THE OUT REACH AS I MENTIONED. BEFORE THE REGIONAL PROGRAM MANAGERS OR REQUIRED YOU KNOW THEY'VE THEY'VE. EVERY WEEK THEY ARE CHECKING AND REACHING OUT JUST WITHIN THE PAST TWO WEEKS SO I I JUST. I I THINK THAT THERE'S AROUND ME TO CUT IT OFF BY IT AND BUT WE ARE STILL SHOWING TIME I MEAN I GUESS I WANT TO BE SURE IS THAT. NO DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS AND I YOU KNOW I I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN MY THE ACBL IN MY AREA AND I'VE WORKED WITH THEM BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE BLIND SPOTS THEY HAVE PEOPLE THERE USED TO WORKING WITH AND SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE PEOPLE WHOM. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DECLARE -- MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS ARE COMMUNITIES -- SOME ARE BETTER AT WORKING WITH SOME THAN OTHERS AND SO WE WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE COVER ALL THOSE BLIND SPOTS AND IN WE HAVE SOME BLIND SPOTS IN A DISTRICT OFFICES BUT I THINK WE START OVERLAPPING BE SURE THEY'RE SUFFICIENT. THEN -- TO SURE WE CAN GET THOSE RESOURCES INTO THIS IT AND AND TO ALL THE PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND I APPRECIATE THAT. THE ANSWER IS YES AND I LOOK FORWARD HOW WE FOLLOW THROUGH ON OUR QUESTION I ALSO HAVE. IS -- IS IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE ACCESS -- ARE YOU GONNA HAVE LANGUAGE ACCESS REQUIREMENTS ARE GONNA FORCE ON THE COUNTY CPOS IN THE MEDIA TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE AT A NO THE SPOKE. TO SOME OF THAT BUT IT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE REACHING OUT TO ALL COMMITTEE CERTAINLY SOMETHING IMPORTANT FOR MANY COMMITTEES INCLUDING THIS -- OUR API COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO MANY OTHERS AS WELL SO -- ARE YOU GONNA HAVE REQUIREMENTS TO BE SURE THAT -- NOT JUST LIKE THE TOP FIVE NECESSARILY. IT MEANS GET FAR MUCH FARTHER DOWN WE KNOW THAT A FORTUNE THE US CENSUS TO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF LANGUAGES THAT THEIR OF PUTTING THINGS INTO AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO THAT MAKES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE. WHO ARE REACHING OUT AND AND AND AT THE STATE OUR STATE OUT REACH? YES IT WILL BE REQUIRED -- LAST WEEK WE PROVIDED AN INTERIM% SET OF STANDARDS WHICH THEY WERE INTERIM BECAUSE THEY'RE MEANT. TO GET INPUT FROM OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- FROM ANY OF YOU AND ANYONE FROM THE PUBLIC WHICH WE WE HAVE BUT THEY ARE REQUIREMENTS -- EVERY REGION WILL BE DIFFERENT -- WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF OF RECEIVING -- AND ANALYZING TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT THRESHOLD SHOULD BE -- YOU KNOW PER REGION BUT FOR THE BIDS AS AN EXAMPLE WE ASK THAT EACH BIDDER FOR THE REGIONALLY CBO CONTRACTS. THAT THEY TALK ABOUT A MINIMUM OF SIX LANGUAGES IN THEIR PARTICULAR REGION THE TOP. SIX BUT MOST RESPONDED WITH A BID THAT INCLUDED -- TWELVE OR MORE AND WE WILL REQUIRE EVERY REGION WILL BE DIFFERENT IT DEPENDS -- IT DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW. HOW MANY LANGUAGES -- ARE WE ARE WE REACHING -- AGAIN WE HAVE OUR LANGUAGE AND OUR RE AND LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATIONS ACCESS MANAGER WE FULLY -- SET ASIDE IN OUR BUDGET FOR ONE FULL TIME STAFF BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE OUT REACH -- BUT I KNOW I'M FREE SHEET THAT AND I THINK -- WELL WHEN YOU'RE OF IN THE THE PERSONAL CHECK WITH. CHAIR BERMAN YET BUT I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT SO WHY ALSO WANTED SO AGAIN AYE SIR BACK TO REITERATE ON THE DISTRICT OFFICES SO. I THINK THAT WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU IN MORE DETAIL EXACTLY LIKE WHAT THE ROLE -- VARIOUS DISTRICT OFFICES CAN PLAY IN PROVIDING INPUT AS TO WHICH MEDIA -- THE LOCAL ACADEMIC LOCAL MEDIA -- THAT SHOULD BE INVOLVED -- AND AS WELL AS OF COURSE -- I DON'T COME EVEN ORGANIZATIONS FRANKLY THE PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT SHOULD BE REACHED OUT -- TO TO TO BE SURE WE HAVE AT AND THE ROLE THAT OUR DISTRICT OFFICE COMPLAIN PROVIDING DOWN INPUT BASHING THE DECISION MAKING [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU AT YOUR PAN AND WE HAVE HAD YOU AND I HAVE AN AGENCY CONNECT BUT MY STAFF -- BRIEF ME AND AND SO I FULLY AGREE WITH YOUR YOUR DESIRE TO HAVE A SEPARATE HEARING JUST ON LANGUAGE ACCESS ISSUES THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY ALSO HAVE A SEPARATE HEARING. SPECIFICALLY ON THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN STRATEGY IS THAT GETS A LITTLE MORE DEVELOPED ONCE THE THE FOLKS REPLIED OUR FEES -- SO -- QUESTION THAT I HAD IT WAS THE TO THE LEGISLATURE SHOW THAT THE STATEWIDE OUR REGION COMMUNICATION STRATEGY. IS SCHEDULED TO BE FINALIZED BY DECEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN IS THAT CORRECT -- I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE STATEWIDE OUR REGION COMMUNICATION STRATEGY THE JOCKS EXACTLY AND SEPTEMBER. I THINK IT'S IT'S MOSTLY A FINALIZED TOWARDS THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR THAT IS CORRECT TOWARD THE END OF INDIAN IN ON PLANETS ROCK KIND OF SOUND NOW WE'RE GONNA BE SEEKING. TO ADD TO IT AS WE GET ALL THE FEEDBACK AND WE GO THROUGH BASICALLY OUR IMPLEMENTATION -- CONVENIENCE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD THAT WE'RE DOING OVER THE SUMMER AND HAS PLAN START DEVELOP WILL BE FOR UP THE SOCKS SO THAT WHEN WE HIT WE HAVE THE TWENTY TWENTY WERE READY TO GO OKAY AND THAT THAT MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS -- IN JUST IN THE IN THE SENSE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE FINALIZING THE STRATEGY ONLY THREE MONTHS BEFORE. CENSUS DAY -- TWENTY TWENTY AND I KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE -- YOU KNOW THE THE ROBUST PROCESS AND A LOT OUR REGION COMMUNICATION MEET HEARINGS WHICH I KNOW YOU ALL OF ALREADY HAD -- INCLUDING TWENTY FOUR LAST YEAR -- SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS DON'T AND WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL TOO LATE BEFORE YOU TAKE BECAUSE INEVITABLY WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT THAT SOME PARTS OF THE PLANE DON'T AREN'T WORKING IN ONE THE TO TO CAN I CHANGE. DIRECTION. AND JUST TO CLARIFY THE BY REGION THE IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING WORKSHOPS WHICH JUST TO MENTION WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE LOOSELY THE SECOND ROUND OF CONVENING -- MANY OF YOUR YOUR STUFF OR INVOLVED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS A READINESS ASSESSMENT THIS YEAR. THE IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING WORKSHOPS WHICH RUNS -- JUNE THROUGH SEPTEMBER THEY ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TWENTY SEVEN OF THEM. WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF PLANNING THOSE THAT'S WHERE THE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS -- WILL BECOME FINALIZED. BEFORE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. START TO HAPPEN COME JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S WHERE ALL THE PARTNERS COME TOGETHER THE CONTRACTORS MEMBERS OF YOUR IN FACT WE WE REALLY WANT THE STUFF. IN YOUR RESPECTIVE OFFICES TO BE PART OF THE RPM'S PLANNING COMMITTEE. GOING TO BRING THIS THIS OR LIKE A KITCHEN CABINET EYES AND EARS -- PER REGION TO HELP PLAN THE THE RIGHT FOLKS ARE THERE NOT JUST THE CONTRACTORS WITH SOME OF THESE -- TRUSTED MESSENGERS SOME OF THESE. ALL CBO SOME OF YOU KNOW I WORK WITH THEM BEFORE IN THE PAST -- THEY JUST BLOSSOM WITHIN THE PAST TWO THREE YEARS CERTAINLY TONS OF AFTER SOCIAL MEDIA TOOK OFF AND ANYWAY THE POINT BEING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT FOLKS ARE AT THESE -- WORKSHOPS THAT WILL HELP THE CONTRACTORS -- FINALIZE THEIR THEIR PLANS. SO THAT THEY CAN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING SO TO SPEAK COME JANUARY PERFECT. BOXES LIKE AN UMBRELLA -- GUIDING -- YEAH DOCUMENTS I WORRY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HITTING THE GROUND RUNNING COME JANUARY I THINK WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS. ESSENTIALLY DESENSITIZE THE CENSUS RIGHT MAKE IT SOMETHING NORMAL MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE IS PARTICIPATING IN MAKING SURE THAT. EVERYONE IS EDUCATED ABOUT IT YEAH AND BE AN EVEN MORE CHALLENGING TASK -- AND SO JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND THIS YEAR -- KIND OF FORMULATING YOUR TIMELINE IS IS THE EARLIER THE BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO STARTING TO REACH OUT OBVIOUSLY THE HEAVY LIFT WILL COME. IN TWENTY TWENTY BUT BUT DON'T JUST WAIT UNTIL THEN TO OKAY NEW YEAR'S EVE TO TO GET THAT PROCESS STARTED -- I HAVE. THE RPM'S GONNA BE DOING A LOT -- AND I WORRY THAT THEY MIGHT BE DOING. TOO MUCH OR OR HAVE TOO MUCH ON THEIR PLATE -- TO BE ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE AT THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT TASKS ON A SOME OF THEM -- ARE GOING TO BE ORGANIZING FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD IN. THE HALF DOZEN OR MORE COUNTIES -- THEY HAVE TO BE ORGANIZING WITH THE THE LOCAL CBO'S -- THE DISTRICT OFFICES FOR DIFFERENT LEGISLATORS -- THE DIFFERENT -- COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE IS AS A BEEN ANY KIND OF THOUGHT ABOUT ARE YOU KNOW IT IS THAT WORKLOAD MANAGEABLE FOR THEM TO REALLY ALSO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND BE -- COORDINATING THE EFFORTS IN THEIR REGIONS. THUS THE DESIGN OF ADMINISTRATIVE CBO. AND WITH THAT STRUCTURE AND OPERATION -- THE WORK IS -- MANAGEABLE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT IS A HUGE WORKLOAD -- YOU KNOW IF I GOT MY GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESS DEGREE. THIS IS LIKE. BOTH WAYS IT WAS MY DREAM JOB WITH -- KIND OF LIKE A YOU KNOW STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT BUT THAT THAT IS WHY THE DESIGN AS IT IS MAKES SENSE AS OPPOSED TO CONTRACTING WITH. INDIVIDUAL CBO'S CONTRACTING WITH INDIVIDUAL CITIES BECAUSE OF THE THE BUDGET THAT WE'VE BEEN ALLOCATED AND THE RESOURCES BEHIND THAT THE THAT STRUCTURE WORKS RIGHT NOW SOME COUNTY -- SOME REGIONS ARE LITTLE. HEAVIER ON THE COUNTY SIDE. I'LL GIVE YOU A GREAT EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW REASON ONE HAS LIKE TWENTY SEVEN COUNTIES -- HOW HOWEVER YOU KNOW LA HAS ONE COUNTY HOWEVER ONLY HAS NINETY CITIES THAT HAVE? A SIGNIFICANT -- HARD TO COUNT POPULATION WITHIN THEM SO WE TAKE A LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE FACTORS. AND DIVIDED UP THE WORK LOAD ACCORDINGLY. PLAYING A GAME OF CHESS SINCE SEPTEMBER AS WE'VE BEEN ADDING STUFF TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY EDUCATING FOLKS ON THE GROUND VARYING DEGREES OF AWARENESS OF THE CENSUS AND ITS VALUE AND IMPORTANCE -- BUT WE'VE BEEN DOING THE EDUCATE THE OXYGEN EDUCATION PHASE GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH. AND JANUARY ACTIVATION THAT'S KIND OF LIKE GET OUT THE VOTE IT'S SORT OF LIKE WHEN WE STARTED WAS REALLY ACTIVATE FOLKS THAT'S WHAT THAT IS I'LL JUST ADD TO IS THAT. FROM OUR LAST LEGISLATIVE REPORT THAT WE PROVIDED WE ACTUALLY DID A REASSESSMENT WE LOOKED AT THE RPM WE ACTUALLY BUMPED UP BY ADDING A COUPLE TO SMALL STAFF GUNS WITH THE LEVELS THAT WE COULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WE ADDED AN ADDITIONAL LEAD. TO THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AREAS THAT WE HAVE A LEAD IN NORTHERN SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND WE ADDED AN ADDITIONAL -- RPM POSITION IN GENERAL TO HELP COVER THE WORKLOAD THAT WE FORESAW COUNTY -- AND THEN A QUESTION ON THE THE THE FUNDING OVERVIEW WHAT IS STATE PROGRAMMATIC COSTS I KNOW IT'S A LINE ITEM UNDER EVERY DIFFERENT CATEGORY -- RIGHT YEAH BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR STATE PROGRAM COSTS AT THE COST OF ACTUALLY RUNNING OUT REACH CAMPAIGN THAT IS THE COST OF A TREE ON THE STAFF AND THE TERMS OF THEM WORKING IN THE FIELD -- WITH OUR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS UNDER ADMINISTRATION AND IT'S NOT AN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS MINISTRY OF COSTS ARE TYPICALLY OR THINGS LIKE HUMAN RESOURCES LEGAL GOD BUDGET -- THOSE TYPES EFFORTS HERE AT HEADQUARTERS GOTCHA -- AND THEN I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION IS [inaudible] THERE. A LOT OF DIFFERENT WELL OF KNOW ALSO THAT FOR ANOTHER TIME THE MY LAST COMMENT I GUESS BECAUSE IN A RUNNING VERY LATE -- IS SO DIFFERENT ONE AGREED WITH THE CONCERNS OR REYES ON THE EDUCATION BUDGET -- AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW -- TRYING TO FEWER RESOURCES TO A VERY -- THE END TO A VERY IMPORTANT POOL OF OF HARD TO COUNT. CALIFORNIANS -- AND THEN I ALSO CHINA WAS SOMEBODY MY OFFICER THERE TODAY -- FROM THE REPRESENTS DIFFERENT TRIBAL GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTS -- AND THE THREE DID SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WAS DEDICATED DIRECTLY TO TO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER YOU KNOW REVENUE STREAMS AND AND DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO TRY TO REACH. TRIBAL MEMBERS BUT THE THREE TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND DIRECTLY TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS SEEM LIKE A VERY SMALL SUM -- AND SO I KNOW THAT YOU ALL HAD A BIG CONVERSATION WITHOUT WITH THE STATEWIDE COMPLETE CHARACTER COMMITTEE LAST WEEK I'M SURE HE'LL BE HAVING FUTURE CONVERSATIONS BUT JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU. TO TO REASSESS THAT -- AND THAT'S ALL OF QUICK QUESTION. THIS IS GOING TO BE TAKING -- PLACE. DURING THE PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTION AND I'M SORRY. WE HAVE A LOT WILL LIKE GOING ON AND AND SO HAVE YOU TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND AND SPECIFICALLY WITH -- ISSUES LIKE -- MEDIA BUYS AND HOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THEY COULD BE AND AND COMPETING IN IT WHEN YOU HAVE REALLY COMPETITIVE DISTRICTS ARE ALSO GOING TO BE COMPETING WITH. A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE KNOCKING ON DOORS AND AND YOU MIGHT HAVE -- RESIDENTS THAT ARE NOT OPENING THE DOORS ANYMORE HAVE YOU TAKEN ALL THAT INTO ACCOUNT. WE HAVE WE HAVE THOUGHT OF THOSE CHALLENGES OF WHETHER OR NOT AND WE ARE WE ARE ABLE TO COMBAT ALL THAT'S GOING TO GOING ON IN THAT. FIRST HALF OF THE NEXT CALENDAR YEAR WITH THE PRIMARY PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY THE OLYMPICS AND OTHER THINGS. IT'S GONNA BE IT'S HARD TO KNOW BUT WE DEFINITELY HAVE SOME COMPETITION OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE'S ATTENTION ON THIS TOPIC. AND FINANCIALLY FOR THINGS LIKE MEDIA BUYS. ARE YOU IT ARE YOU EXPECTING THAT IT'S GONNA BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN. WOULD BE NOW. WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THAT SPECIFICALLY BUT AS JUSTIN SAID -- WE DEFINITELY HAVE AND ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW -- COMPLICATED THE CALENDAR IT IS -- WE WILL WE WILL DISCUSS OR IF HE THAT SAT ON WE'LL GET A BETTER SENSE ONCE WE GET BACK OUR RESPONSES TO OUR P. WE ENGAGE ARE THE POTENTIAL MAMA WAR EASE WHEN WE GO THROUGH OUR NEGOTIATION PERIOD THEY WILL LET US KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SEEN WHAT THEIR POTENTIAL. COSTS ARE GONNA BE FOR ME AND MY CENTER MARK. THE LOCATIONS IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING CORRECT THAT YOU'LL. YOU MEAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE IDENTIFIED HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE AND HAVE NOT COMPLETED THE CENSUS FORM. SO WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE HAT U. S. CENSUS BUREAU THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDING US WITH RESPONSE RATES SO -- I THAT BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE IS A KIND OF POSSIBLE BUT CAN WE SAY THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS HAS NOT OR HAS FILLED OUT A SURVEY. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA WE'RE GONNA GET TO THAT. LEVEL OF DETAIL FROM THEM BUT WE SAID NO LIKE WITHIN THIS BLOCK GROUP AREA -- WHETHER OR NOT 10% OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE RESPONDED OR 15% RESPONDED SO WE'LL KNOW GENERALLY WHERE WE'RE AT ON THE RESPONSE RATES FOR GET SPECIFICS AND I'VE TRACKED I GUESS I'M. LOOKING AT IT FROM. THE PERSPECTIVE OF HAVING GONE THROUGH ALL OF US HAVE GONE THROUGH CAMPAIGNS AND YOU CAN TELL WHO'S VOTER HAS VOTED. YOU GET OUT THOSE WHO HAVE NOT VOTED BUT WE WON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION SUCH THAT WE CAN GO TO A HOUSEHOLD AND IDENTIFY THAT HOUSEHOLD. THAT IS NOT. BEEN NUMEROUS RIGHT THAT IS MY UNDERSTAND I'M NOT GONNA HAVE INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLD INFORMATION FROM THE OKAY. NOW WAS STANDING THAT CAN CAN WE STILL DO I'VE BEEN COUNTED BUTTONS LIKE COULD DO I VOTED BUTTONS OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS LITTLE STICKERS. THAT IS A FANTASTIC IDEA AND WE CAN DEFINITELY LOOK INTO MAKING SURE THAT GETS INCLUDED. THANKS. I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT ON THAT.

WE WORK TO ADDRESS ROT CAUSES ARE PRESSING CHALLENGES THAT PREVENT THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR REGION FROM THRIVING IN THE AREAS OF EDUCATION. HOUSING HEALTH AND IMMIGRATION. AND ACHIEVING A COMPLETE COUNT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS IS A CORE PRIORITY FOR US HAVING PARTICIPATED IN THE TWENTY TEN CENTS A SEPARATE AS WELL. THE FORMIDABLE CHALLENGES THAT THE CENSUS PRESENTS REQUIRES THE KIND OF COMMITMENT AND LEADERSHIP BEFITTING THE STRENGTH AND THE PRESERVATION AND SERVE THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. SO THE CORNERSTONE OF THE CENSUS EFFORT IS OUR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY AND COUNTY OF LA. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERS. IT IS BECAUSE OF THOSE EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS KNOWLEDGE IN CIVIC ENGAGEMENT GRANT MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE AND PLANNING EFFORTS TO DATE SINCE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WE BELIEVE CCF WAS SELECTED TO SERVE. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT A GUIDING PRINCIPLE. FOR CCAF IS PROMISE ON LEVERAGING STATE RESOURCES AND COORDINATING WITH THE STATE'S. COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL EFFORTS ARE COORDINATED AND THINGS UP WITH THE STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN. SO WE BELIEVE LA COUNTY IS THE EPICENTER OF STATEWIDE EFFORTS FOR A COMPLETE COUNT. WITH MORE THAN THREE MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN CENSUS TRACTS CLASSIFIED AS HIGH RISK OF AN UNDERCOUNT. THE LA REGION IS THE HARDEST ACCOUNT COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN THE NATION. MORE OVER OUR INCREDIBLE ETHNIC DIVERSITY AND GEOGRAPHIC COMPLEXITY. REQUIRE HYPER COORDINATION ONGOING COLLABORATION. AND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE THAT. TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT THERE ARE CURRENTLY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN LA. COMMUNITIES ARE SPREAD ACROSS EIGHTY EIGHT DIFFERENT CITIES WITH AN ARRAY OF EIGHTY ONE SCHOOLS DISTRICTS. SO WHAT'S GOING ON IN LA AND WHAT IS THE FOUNDATION DOING TO SUPPORT CENSUS OUTREACH EFFORTS. I'M GONNA HIGHLIGHT FIVE KEY POINTS THIS -- TODAY. SO NUMBER ONE WE ARE SECURING AND STREAMLINING RESEARCH THAT'S FOR COMMUNITY BASED EFFORTS. SO SEE SEE I'VE HAD SECURED LOCAL DOLLARS TO LAUNCH A STREAMLINED SINGLE SOURCE FUNDING AND REPORTING. FOR COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS WORKING WITH. AND ON IN THE HEART TO COUNT. GROUP SOME POPULATIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE REGIONAL FUNDS THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED CCF HAS BEEN WORKING ON RAISING AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS. TO SUPPORT DIRECT SENSE OF OUTRAGE. TWO WE ARE SUPPORTING A COMMUNITY DRIVEN PLAN FOR EDUCATION AND MOBILISATION. SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CENSUS POLICY IN ADVOCACY INSTITUTE -- NETWORK SORRY WE HELPED ESTABLISH THE LA REGIONAL CENSUS TABLE. WHICH BROUGHT TOGETHER NEARLY A HUNDRED OR SERVING A VARIETY OF POPULATIONS DEAN'S HARD TO COUNT TO DEVELOP OR REGIONAL PLAN OF ACTION FOR LA. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE CENSUS UP THE ALLEY REGIONAL CENSUS TABLES ABOUT FAME TABLE GREW AND REACH. AND IS NOW CONVENING HYPER LOCAL ACROSS -- ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS SIX DESIGNATED. REGIONS IN THE COUNTY SO FROM ANTELOPE VALLEY TO LNG BEACH TO SOUTH LA [inaudible] TO POMONA -- THESE MEETINGS ARE CREATED TO ENSURE THAT ALL VOICES ARE HEARD. IN THE PLANNING PHASE. AND THE COLLECTIVE LEARNINGS ARE ALSO OCCURRING. DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION STATIONS. SO THESE MEETINGS ARE BRINGING TOGETHER NOW HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS SOUTHEAST ASIANS. NATIVE AMERICANS CHILDREN -- LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT IMMIGRANTS LGBT Q. COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- TO JUST JUST TO NAME A FEW. THREE IN ADDITION TO CCAF IN ADDITION CCF HAS ESTABLISHED A STEERING COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF TEN LEADING -- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. TO HELP -- TO REALLY SERVE AS ADVISORS TO THE FOUNDATION TO HELP WAS WITH SETTING FUNDING PRIORITIES. TO SHAPE AND LAUNCH A UNIFIED -- CAMINO AND TO ADVICE ON THE BALLOT A SHOULD METRICS THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM AND THAT'S ALSO VALUE. TO THEM. SO SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE NOT LA -- CALIFORNIA CALLS CALIFORNIA NATIVE BOOK PROJECTS ELLIE VOICE BUCKLEY MOVE YOU TO FULL LONG BEACH FOR ITS SOUTHEAST LA COLLABORATIVE ANTELOPE VALLEY PARTNERS FOR HEALTH. AND ADVANCEMENT PROJECT CALIFORNIA. NUMBER. FOUR WE KNOW THIS IS A LANDMARK CENSUS AS SUCH LEARNINGS FROM. THIS EFFORT WILL BE CRUCIAL IN FUTURE AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT -- CAMPAIGNS SO WE ARE BEGINNING TO ALSO MAP OUT -- EVALUATION CRITERIA TO SET A PLAN IN ACTION. AND LASTLY NUMBER FIVE OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS SEE SEE APPLE RELIEF AN INITIAL COUNTY WIDE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. AROUND IDENTIFIED CENSUS OUT REACH TACTICS SUCH AS COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND ORDERED OR CAMPUS SAYING ASSISTANCE CENTERS TO NAME A FEW -- AT WHAT OUR GOAL BEING TO REALLY PROVIDE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE FUNDING THAT THEY NEED BY THE SUMMER OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO THAT THEY CAN BUILD THEIR CAPACITY AND START TO IMPLEMENT THEIR THEIR PLANS INTO ACTION. SO TO CLOSE WE BELIEVE THAT COMMUNITY -- PARTNERS MUST HAVE A LEADING VOICE IN OUR EFFORTS. THAT THE FLOW OF RESOURCES SHOULD BE INFORMED BY THEIR NEEDS. AND THAT ON THE GROUND ORGANIZING AND COMMUNITY EDUCATION WILL WIN THE DAY FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS. BUT ORDINATION IS ESSENTIAL AND IT MUST BE NOW. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS RAMIREZ MS ROBINSON. THANK YOU TO THE OF THREE COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- ALSO APPRECIATE YOU STAYING LATE -- TO FOR THIS HEARING -- MY NAME IS JUDY ROBINSON ON THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS MANAGER FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY -- IT IS AN HONOR AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY -- I'VE ALSO HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH SOME OF YOUR STAFF AS WELL AS STATE CENSUS STAFF SINCE JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THEY'RE AWESOME. SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS MOST APPRECIATIVE OF THE NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WE WILL RECEIVE IN STATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT CENSUS OUT REACH. WE HAVE SIGNED THE STATE CONTRACT AND ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING OUR STRATEGIC AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS IN COLLABORATION WITH A COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE'RE VERY EXCITED THAT THE SACRAMENTO REGION COMMUNITY FOUNDATION WAS SELECTED AS REGION ONE A CBO. TOGETHER WE'RE COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING THE STATE AND DEPLOYING SENSES OUT EDUCATION AND ASSISTANCE TO OUR ONE POINT FIVE MILLION RESIDENTS TO ACHIEVE A COMPLETE COUNT. SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS ONE OF THE TOP TEN HARDEST ACCOUNT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. SACRAMENTO IS ONE OF THE THREE MOST DIVERSE CITIES IN THE STATE AND HOME TO MOST OF THE TO MOST OF THE REFUGEES. RE SETTLEMENTS IN THE NATION. OUR LOCAL STATE UNIVERSITY CSU SACRAMENTO HAS 46% OF ITS STUDENT POPULATION IS FIRST GENERATION IMMIGRANTS. WITH OVER THIRTY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AHEAD AND WERE PREPARING TO MEET THEM. IN SUPPORTING THE STATE'S GUIDANCE OUR COMMUNITY OUT REGION ENGAGEMENT PLAN IS UTILIZING TRUSTED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY MESSENGERS TO REACH THE HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS. AND BECAUSE OF OUR CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THE REGION FOUNDATION STARTING LAST APRIL. THEY'RE BRINGING IN THE COMMUNITY PIECE OF ARE SO WE ALSO ENGAGED ALL OF OUR CITIES LAST APRIL I'VE BEEN MEETING REGULARLY WITH THEM. OUR COMMUNITY GOVERNMENT -- AND PARTNERSHIP COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION WILL BUILD CAPACITY LEVERAGE RESOURCES AND AVOID DUPLICATION. A COMPLETE COUNT SENSES FOR SACRAMENTO COUNTY WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY APPLYING COMMUNITY DESIGNED AND COMMUNITY CENTERED OUT READ STRATEGIES. THEY WILL BE INNOVATIVE COMPREHENSIVE AND COHESIVE RESULTING IN STRENGTHENING COUNTY WIDE MULTI SECTOR COLLABORATION. THIS WILL BE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COMMUNITY AND LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS. WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY WE FORMED A COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE STRUCTURE WITH TWO STEERING COMMITTEES GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY. THEY'VE BEEN MEETING SINCE LAST FALL. THE COMMUNITY COMMITTEE IS CARRYING THE LOAD OF HARD TO COUNT GROUPS AND ARE THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS DURING THE MOST CRITICAL AND LABOR INTENSIVE WORK. THEY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE AND ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED. THE COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEES AND THEY'RE WORKING GROUP'S ARE CREATING AN EXTENSIVE INVENTORY OF RESOURCES ASSETS AND FACILITIES WHICH IS BEING PUT INTO A MINISTRY AT A G. TO INFORM OUR STRATEGIC INFORMATION AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS. AND IDENTIFY GAPS SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THEM. THE WORKING GROUP'S CURRENTLY HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED AND ARE CONTINUALLY ADDING MORE TO GROW COMMUNITY IN ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY. OVER THOUSAND HOURS HAVE BEEN DONATED TO DATE. WE'RE LEVERAGING LESSONS LEARNED FROM LAST NOVEMBER'S VOTERS CHOICE ELECTION WHICH SAW THE HIGHEST VOTER TURNOUT FOR MID TERM GENERAL ELECTION. IN COUNTY HISTORY. CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE COMMUNITY LEVER THERE'S AN HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES A SHARED PARTICIPATION EVENTS ARE ALL PART OF OUR OUTREACH PLAN. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY TO PLAN EVENTS ACROSS THE COUNTY IN PARTICULAR HARD TO COUNT NEIGHBORHOODS. EVENTS WILL BE HELD AT SCHOOLS LIBRARIES PARKS COMMUNITY CENTERS CHURCHES HEALTH CENTERS AND HOUSING COMPLEXES. WE WILL BE HIRING COMMUNITY RESIDENTS TO HELP WITHOUT REACH WE'RE PLANNING LOCAL EVENTS WITH A LIBRARY VAN AND POTENTIALLY FOOD TRUCKS. AND TO GO TO THE RESIDENTS TO MAKE THIS AS EASY AS POSSIBLE AND GET CENSUS QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. AND YES MORE FUNDING IS NEEDED -- FOR SACRAMENTO AND ACROSS THE STATE FOR COUNTIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. I MENTIONED SACRAMENTO'S DIVERSITY BUT THE STATE FUNDING DISTRIBUTION FORMULA DIDN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE BROAD VARIETY OF LANGUAGES SPOKEN. THE DIFFERENCES IN CULTURES AND THE INCREASED COST TO ENGAGE WITH THESE VERY DIFFERENT GROUPS. SACRAMENTO COUNTY NEEDS AN ADDITIONAL THREE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT WITH THE STATE IS ASKING OF US. THESE FUNDS WILL SUPPORT AND NOT DUPLICATE FUNDING CBO'S. A DUPLICATE THE FUNDING THAT CBO'S WILL BE RECEIVING. THERE WILL BE STATE LANGUAGE ACCESS REQUIREMENTS AND THE HOMELESS COUNT WILL NEED LOCAL RESOURCES AND NAVIGATORS ALL REQUIRING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT. FURTHER THERE IS NO FUNDING FOR HIGHER ED AND LIBRARIES THERE'S A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING GOING TO K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. HOWEVER AS EARLIER MENTIONED THAT'S A SMALL AMOUNT TO BE SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE WILL RECEIVE. FIFTY THREE THOUSAND TO SURE WAS SIXTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH AND STUDENTS. HIGHER EDUCATION LIBRARIES ARE BEING REFERRED TO THE COUNTIES COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEES FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THE LIST GOES ON THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION ALLOCATED FOR REGION ONE CBO'S IS WOEFULLY UNDERFUNDED. REGION ONE HAS SEVENTEEN VERY DIVERSE COUNTIES AND COVERS THE LARGEST YEAR GRAPHIC AREA IN THE STATE. SACRAMENTO'S PORTION OF FUNDING IS THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE WORK OUR CBO'S WILL BE DOING. UNLIKE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE SACRAMENTO HAS NOT RECEIVED FUNDING FROM FOUNDATIONS TO HELP WITH THE CENSUS WORK. SACRAMENTO CBO'S WILL NEED ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO COVER THE TO IN FUNDING TO DO THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND WORK. FOR DISSIPATING CONDUCT OF ANTS. PROVIDE EARLY CENSUS PARTICIPATION IN NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP. WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THERE IS GREAT COLLABORATION OCCURRING AT ALL LEVELS AND WILL CONTINUE. THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. THEY WERE QUESTIONS ANSWERED EARLIER NEXT TIME ALLOWS WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE -- THANK YOU AGAIN [inaudible] HI. HI AM COLLEEN STEVENS AND I MARKETING DIRECTOR FOR COVER CALIFORNIA. AND I AM PLEASED TO TO ALLOW ME TO SHARE SOME INSIGHTS INTO WHAT WE LEARNED. IN RAMPING UP COVERED CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF MARKETING. SO THAT LOTS OF OUR SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TACIT COVER CALIFORNIA HAD IN THE TASK YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU -- BOTH OF US NEEDED TO REACH HARDER TO AND USING TRUSTED MESSENGERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BOTH OF US ARE USING A COMBINATION OF GROUND TROOPS AND OUR MARKETING EFFORTS. BOTH OF US ARE NEED TO WORK BOB COORDINATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND ARE WORKING UNDER. FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD RIDICULOUS TIME LINES TO GET THESE THINGS DONE. FOR COVER CALIFORNIA WE DID A LOT OF PLANNING JUST AS YOU DID AND ONE OF THE LAST COMPOSED TO BE ADDED IN REALLY FLESHED OUT WAS THE MARKETING CAMPAIGN. IN MAY OF TWENTY THIRTEEN WE MAILED ON OUR CONTRACT WITH OUR ADVERTISING AGENCY. IN JULY OF THE SAME YEAR WE HIRED OUR FIRST MARKETING STAFF. AND BY SEPTEMBER WE HAD A FULL COMPLETE CAMPAIGN IN THE MARKETPLACE PROMOTING COVER CALIFORNIA. BASED ON THE TYPE TIMELINE WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF THINGS. WHAT IS WE ENDED UP WITH A REALLY GREAT ADVERTISING AGENCY THAT WENT THE EXTRA MILE OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEY DID THINGS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT GO AGAINST EVERYTHING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL -- IT WAS A BIG ENOUGH AGENCY TO GET THE JOB DONE BUT WAS ALSO FLEXIBLE ENOUGH THAT IT COULD BRING IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WOULD WE NEED THAT THEM AND THAT WAS OFTEN -- WE WERE ALSO LUCKY THAT COVER CALIFORNIA WAS ABLE TO HIRE A FEW PEOPLE. MYSELF INCLUDED WHO ALREADY HAD WORKED ON MARKETING CAMPAIGNS WHO KNEW THE STATE RULES AND HOW TO MANAGE A CONTRACT AND HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR DOLLARS. LASTLY WE HAD A VERY SUPPORT OF LEADERSHIP TEAM AND THAT LEADERSHIP TEAM DID A LOT OF WORK IN TERMS OF GETTING AROUND STATE PROCESS NOT THAT GETTING AROUND IS THE WRONG PHRASE. TO MAXIMIZING STATE PROCESSES SO WE DIDN'T GET BOGGED DOWN IN STATE PROCESSES WHICH SOMETIMES HAPPENS. COVERED CALIFORNIA INVEST ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON MARKETING OUTREACH AND THAT'S A COMBINATION OF OUR COMMUNITY GROUNDS ARE OP COLUMNS AND A MARKETING CAMPAIGN. THE ACTUAL ADVERTISING BAD BUDGET ITSELF IS BETWEEN FORTY ONE AND FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WITH A LARGER AMOUNT SPENT IN THE FIRST YEAR COVERS CREATIVE RESEARCH PRODUCTION COLLATERAL SOCIAL MEDIA. AND TV AND RADIO PLACEMENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS GO TO BY MEDIA TIME. SO I'M OFTEN ASKED WHY THIS MEDIA COST SO MUCH MONEY. AND CAL IS BASED ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ANTICIPATED TO SEE ANY GIVEN AT AND A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WHERE THE SIZES SO LARGE -- IT COST MORE COOPER JUST LARGE CALIFORNIA HAS WITHIN IT IF TALK OF THE TOP TWENTY GENERAL MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES THREE OF THE TOP GENERAL MARKETS IN FOR THE ENGLISH MARKET. AND FIVE OF THE TOP LATINO MARKETS OF THE UNITED STATES. AND I COULD GO WITH OTHER MARKETS BUT YOU GET THE PICTURE. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED THAT IS WORK SUCCESSFULLY FOR US IS A LAYERED APPROACH TO BUYING MEDIA. THERE ARE MORE MEDIA CHOICES THAT ANYBODY COULD POSSIBLY AFFORD TO BUY. AND MEDIA'S CONSUMPTION OF PEOPLE'S CONSUMPTION OF MEDIA VARIES BY THEIR AGE THEIR INCOME THEIR EDUCATION AND WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM. TO GIVE YOU JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS IS COMPLICATED IF YOU THINK OF THE LATINO POPULATION AND I'M A TALK ABOUT WHAT HE WAS VERY BROADLY. THEIR PEOPLE ONLY SPEAK SPANISH THEIR LATINOS WHO FEEL VERY TACTILE THE COMMUNITY BUT THEY ONLY SPEAK ENGLISH AND THEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN BETWEEN WHO CAN SPEAK BOTH LANGUAGES. SO IF WE JUST BOUGHT SPANISH LANGUAGE MEDIA WE WOULDN'T REACH THE PEOPLE AND THERE'S A BIG PART SENATOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T SPEAK SPANISH WHO ARE VERY MUCH RELATE TO THAT CULTURE. SO WE BY SPANISH MEDIA IN THE IN CAN TELL SPECIFIC SHOWS THAT HAVE HIGH VIEWERSHIP OF LATINOS AND WE ALSO BY THOSE SHOWS. AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BILINGUAL WE MAKE SURE THAT THE MESSAGES THAT RUN IN SPANISH TV AN ENGLISH TV ARE COMPLEMENTARY SO IT'S NOT A CONFUSION FOR THE PERSON WHO'S WATCHING BOTH LANGUAGES. AND THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF ONE LANGUAGE THERE'S A DIFFERENT THAT DYNAMIC FOR ALMOST EVERY ETHNIC COMMUNITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE'VE ALSO FOUND. THAT HAVING ONE STATEWIDE AGENCY WITH ETHNIC SUBCONTRACTORS WITH EXPERTISE IN REACHING THEIR COMMUNITIES. COMBINED WITH THE STATE WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN WORKS BEST. SO THAT WE END OF SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE HAVING CONSISTENT MESSAGING AND CLEAR MESSAGING FOR EVERYBODY. WHILE THE PLAN IS STATEWIDE IT IS INFUSED WITH. ETHNIC IN LANGUAGE AND HYPER LOCAL MEDIA TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MEDIA [inaudible] PENETRATION. WHILE WE HAVE GREAT CONTRACTORS IT REMAINS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT DIVERSITY WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE SURE ARE WE REACHING. THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATIONS WERE TRYING TO GET TO AND THEN THAT COULD BE ETHNIC OR LANGUAGE OR GEOGRAPHIC. I HAVE WORKED AND NO OTHER PROGRAMS WHERE THEY USED MORE REGIONAL APPROACH AND WHILE IT SOUNDS GOOD THERE ARE SOME DOWNFALLS TO USING A MORE REGIONAL APPROACH. WANTED CAUSES HORRIFIC PROBLEMS INTERESTS ACCORDING ATION YOU GET IN CONSISTENT MESSAGING THE BIG COUNTIES CAN DO IT BETTER THE SMALL COUNTIES HAVE VERY LITTLE TO NO FUNDING -- IT CAUSES INCREASE PRODUCTION COST AND DUPLICATE COSTS AND LASTLY THERE BUYING EFFICIENCIES WHERE YOU COULD REALLY MAP OUT. A PROGRAM -- SO THAT YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF THE DOLLARS AND I SHOULD ADD ONE MORE. MEDIA THE CIRCLED MEDIA GOES OUT IS NOT BASED ON COUNTY LINES SO SOME COUNTIES MIGHT GET THREE DIFFERENT STATIONS I MEAN. YOU KNOW MAYBE MAKE IT SAN FRANCISCO MEDIA THEY MIGHT GET SACRAMENTO MEDIA AND THEY MIGHT GET SHE GOT ME TO GET JUST DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE -- MEDIA CAMPAIGNS ARE UNIQUE AMONG OTHER KIND OF CAMPAIGNS AND YOU WILL FIND THIS AS YOU MOVE FORWARD AND YOU GET OPINIONS FROM PEOPLE. EVERYBODY IS AN EXPERT ON MEDIA EVERYBODY HAS AN OPINION ABOUT MEDIA. WHOEVER RUNS THIS CAMPAIGN WILL LIKELY FIND THAT THEY ARE COSTLY APPROACH WITH IDEAS FOR THE NEXT GREAT COMMERCIAL. MEDIA VENDORS ROUTINELY GO AROUND THE STATE STAFF AND GO STRAIGHT TO THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT -- TO PITCH THEIR PRODUCTS. EVERY SINGLE WEEK. SOMEONE IS TRYING TO SELL ME THEIR BRAND NEW SOFTWARE A NEW SPORTS TEAM SPONSORSHIP A NEW MEDIA PLATFORM AND IF I JUST SPENT MY MONEY WITH THEM. I WOULD END UP DOING BETTER OR THAT ALL WILL BE RIGHT WITH THE WORLD. SO MY JOB OR WHOEVER RUNS THIS CAMPAIGN'S JOB. IS TO BE DISCIPLINED. TO USE THEIR ADVERTISING AGENCIES AND THEIR EXPERTISE BOTH IN THE GENERAL MARKET AND ETHNIC MARKETS TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE SOUND AND MAXIMIZE THE INVESTMENT. MY JOB IS TO STAY ON STRATEGY TO MAKE SURE WE DELIVER ON THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM AND TO UTILIZE OUR MEDIA PARTNERS. TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THE BEST JOB TO MAXIMIZE RESOURCES. AND TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM. I THINK I MISSED A PIECE OF PAPER MAYBE HAD. SO YOU GUYS HAVE A TOUGH JOB AHEAD OF YOU. AND I DON'T ENVY YOU AT ALL THAT'S THAT'S WITH THE MISSING. IS A PIECE OF PAPER SAID. YES IT DOES. I THINK I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT COVERED CALIFORNIA THAT WITHIN OUR STAFF HAS A LOT OF GOOD EXPERIENCE IT IN LOTS OF THINGS BOTH I THANK ABOUT MARKETING BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF COMMUNITIES CBO'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE AND WE ARE ALWAYS WILLING TO SERVE. AS A RESOURCE FOR OTHER STATE AGENCIES [inaudible] YOUR THANK YOU ARE TO DAHLE THREE VERY MUCH I KNOW WHEN I STARTED -- ENGAGING IN CENSUS EFFORTS. SOME OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO COME AND AND PRESS US WHERE THE FOUNDATIONS AND IN THE FOUNDATION WORLD -- AND I'M PRETTY SURE THEY PROMISE US THEY'RE GONNA MATCH AS ONE FOR ONE IN TERMS OF STATE SPENDING SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ANTICIPATED WE SPENT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AT THAT TIME -- BUT OUR FOUNDATIONS ARE SUCH A CRITICAL PARTNER -- IN TERMS OF REACHING OUT TO THE WHO THOSE TRUSTED MESSENGERS ARE TO HAVING DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS -- AND SO -- YOU KNOW ARE GONNA BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS EFFORT -- IS THE THE THE COUNTY GOVERNMENTS I REPRESENT. SAN MATTEO COUNTY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY -- AND I KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING AS HARD AS ANYBODY -- ON THIS AND IN CAN MEANING THAT THE LEVEL COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEES AND YOU KNOW WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT KNOWING WITH THOSE TRUST MESSENGERS ARE AND AND ARE COUNTIES. ARE THE ONES WHO OFTEN HAVE WORKED WITH THEM AND HAVE CONTRACTS WITH THEM ALREADY -- IN PLACE AND SO REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND THEN COVER CALIFORNIA YEAH. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT COVER CALIFORNIA FOREVER IS THE GOLD STANDARD -- SO IS A REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND PROVIDING YOUR EXPERTISE DIDN'T ONE QUESTION AND IS. ONE OF THE VERY FIRST ASK MISTY EVENTS IT. IF YOU WERE US AND AND YOU WERE FACING THIS TASK AND AND KIND OF YOU KNOW THE THE GO DAY WAS ALSO APRIL FIRST EVEN THOUGH IT'S KIND OF MARCH TWENTY THIRD BUT FOR SOME REASON WE SAY TABLE FIRST -- WHEN WOULD YOU BE? ON THE AIRWAVES AND WHEN WOULD YOU BE ACTIVELY -- DO PUSHING OUT MESSAGE YOUR YOUR MESSAGE. TO TO THE VOTER I'D SOME VOTERS CONSTITUENTS TO THE FOLKS. I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THIS BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED IT COVER CALIFORNIA YEAH SO WHEN COVER CALIFORNIA STIRRED. IS STARTED ADVERTISING IN SEPTEMBER FOR AN OPEN ENROLLMENT THIS STARTED ON OCTOBER FIRST. AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE SIGNED UP WHO HAD. MAYBE BEEN HUNGRY FOR INSURANCE IT WAS A PENT UP DEMAND AND SIGNED UP RIGHT AWAY. AND WE HAVE FOUND IN SUBSEQUENT LEADERS NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE SAY GET OUT THERE AND DO IT EARLY SO WE'VE LEARNED TO GO AROUND DATES SO WE FRIDAY A PREP PEOPLE FOR THE FACT THAT THE OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD IS COMING WE OP WROTE IT AT A LOWER LEVEL. TO START WITH AND DO STRATEGIC PLACEMENT AND THEN AS A GETS CLOSER RATCHETED UP. AND AGAIN THIS IS WE JUST FINISHED OUR SIX YEAR AND IT'S THE SAME PATTERN EVERY TIME NO MATTER HOW MUCH NOTICE WE GIVE THEM. RIGHT AROUND THOSE FINAL DEADLINES IS WHAT EVERYBODY DOES IT SO -- I REALLY. LOOK AT THE MEDIA AND STRETCH IT OUT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT'S REALLY THERE WHEN YOU NEED IT THE MOST AND NOT DO A LOT OF UP FRONT ADVERTISING. SO YOU ACTUALLY STILL HAVE TIME. THAT'S THAT'S HEARTENING TO HEAR AND THE JUDY YOU SAID YOU WANT TO ANSWER -- YEAH YOU SAID YOU WANT ANSWERS IN THE EARLIER QUESTIONS -- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THEN TO ALL THREE OF YOU IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS. OR COMMENTS BASED ON SOME OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED PLEASE DON'T DON'T. DON'T HOLD BACK. GREAT THANK YOU. DID YOU WANNA JACKSON THING SENATOR PAN. FOR WHAT YOU GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT I WANT TO ASK THEM. GREAT -- THANK YOU SO -- THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT CAME UP EARLIER ON AROUND EDUCATION AND FORTUNATELY SACRAMENTO COUNTY ALONG WITH FRESNO COUNTY IN LA COUNTY OR THE THREE OFFICES OF EDUCATION ON VETERAN THAT ARE INVOLVED -- WITH CREATING CURRICULUM AND I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE SEEN THE CURRICULUM AND IT'S IT'S IT'S AWESOME. AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CENSUS NIGHTS LIKE YOU HAVE BACK TO SCHOOL NIGHTS AND AND AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND AND IN MY COMMENTS I I ALLUDED TO THAT YOU KNOW. THE THE K. TWELVE FUNDING REALLY NEEDS TO BE OR INCREASE FUNDING TO THE CBO'S OR COUNTIES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SUPPLEMENT MORE -- EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES TO BE ABLE TO USE SCHOOLS AS OUR PARTNERS ON THE IDEA OF OF POSTER CONTESTS THE AND BEING ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE ON THAT THAT THE STUDENTS AT DIFFERENT AGES AND AND MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN BRING THEIR PARENTS IN TWO OF THE SCHOOLS AND YOUTH. AND AND BEING ABLE TO ASSIST IN COMPLETING THE CENSUS THOSE ARE. A NUMBER OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DOING IN SACRAMENTO THAT CAN BE REPLICATED ACROSS THE STATE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE WE ALREADY WELL AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH SO MANY OF THE DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND TEACHERS THE AND YOU. KNOW THEY'RE ALREADY OVERWHELMED AND SO WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IN INCENTIVIZE THEM FAR AND ABOVE WHAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE AND AND CHRIS AND THAT IN ALSO A PLACE TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND THEN ALSO -- Là OUR OUR OUR LIBRARIES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO THE ON ALL WORK% TOGETHER ON THERE WAS A SUGGESTION ACTUALLY THAT WAS MADE THAT WENT TO ONE OF CENTER OF BERKS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT MAY BE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT DO IT AND THERE IS -- THE LET YOU KNOW OR FROM THROUGH MID APRIL BECAUSE IT'S REALLY MORE THAN A WEEK -- BUT SIMILAR TO THEIRS VOTER EDUCATION WEEK THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALREADY DOES. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD FURTHER HELP -- SUPPORT SCHOOLS SO I I I OFFER THAT TO YOU -- THERE'S PROBABLY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW TALKING MORE LOCALLY ABOUT HOW WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT WERE ENGAGING WITH THE RIGHT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND HOW IS IT THAT WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT FOLKS AT THE TABLE AND AND AND WE SPENT MONTHS WITH THE REGION. FOUNDATION -- AND A NUMBER OF OTHER WELL RESPECTED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTY VETTING ORGANIZATIONS AND VETTING THEIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WERE THERE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE CAPACITY THAT THEY WERE WELL RESPECTED THAT THEY HAD LEADERSHIP -- CAPABILITIES AND CAPACITY AND THAT THEY WERE REPRESENTING THE RIGHT GROUPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HARD TO COUNT WERE IN FACT COVERED IN IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH HOW AMAZING THAT COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE -- IS IS REPRESENTED -- AND THEN WANTED KINDA LAST POINT THAT HASN'T COME UP IN ANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS IN AND AROUND THE THAT THE CENSUS AND ALL. AND I KNOW THAT WE TALK ABOUT -- NUMBER OF CONGRESSIONAL SEATS WE TALK ABOUT STATE -- LOSS OF OF FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHAT WE DON'T HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IS HOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA USES CENSUS DATA. AND I'VE WRITTEN A TON OF GRANTS ON BOND GRANT THAT'S GOING THROUGH -- FUNDING RIGHT NOW HAS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT GOES I GO OUT ON A PER CAPITA BASIS. SO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THIS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE I MEAN HOW IS THIS GOING TO AFFECT THE DATA AND HOW WE DISTRIBUTE FUNDING TO OUR OWN STATE. AND WE AND WITH IT IF IF IF WE DON'T GET IT RIGHT YOU KNOW WE RUN SERVICE SEVERE RISK OF LOSING REGIONS THAT YOU KNOW IN SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF OF THE STATE. ARE BECAUSE OF THE IMBALANCE IN AN ACCURACY OF THE DATA THAT WE'RE COLLECTING SOUGHT I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THAT ON OUR RADAR -- AND HONE IN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CONNECTING THE DOTS TO ALL THE FUNDING CALIFORNIA DISTRIBUTES ON YOUR CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS NAME IT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY CARVE OUT. SO THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE POINTS I WANT TO CIRCLE BACK. TO THANK YOU. SO I WANTED TO EXPAND ON ONE AREA THAT I HAD SPOKEN TO ABOUT LAYERED MEDIA. SO WE DO AND USE THAT. MAJOR MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO DO AN UMBRELLA CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE PEOPLE TO MOTIVATE THEM TO TELL THEM WHAT THE DEADLINES ARE. AND I HAVE BEEN BUYING ETHNIC MEDIA FOR THIRTY YEARS SO I'M. A BIG BELIEVER. BUT IN THE BROAD KIND OF REACH YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THEIR ART ETHNIC MEDIA IN ALL THE AREAS YOU NEED THERE TO BE ETHNIC MEDIA. AN ETHNIC MEDIA FOLLOWS WHERE THERE'S POPULATIONS. SO -- THERE'S A LOT OF ASIANS THE BAY AREA BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE BUT IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE THAT AREA OR LA THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY MEDIA. THAT REACHES PEOPLE WHO DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE SO YOU HAVE TO REALLY LOOK AT LAYERING AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEDIA TO REACH DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE -- AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK OF THE BEST EXAMPLE I COULD BE GIVE IS OF ANY USE THE SACRAMENTO BEE. I WOULD DISSECT WILL BE EVERY DAY IF YOU PUT AN AD IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE ONCE A WEEK FOR THE WHOLE NEXT YEAR. I'LL READ IT A COUPLE TIMES BUT I WILL READ IT EVERY SINGLE DAY BECAUSE AFTER AWHILE GET USED TO IT. BUT I READ THE SECOND MAYBE IT EVEN IF YOU USE THAT PAPER EVERY SINGLE WEEK. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER READ THE SACRAMENTO BEE AND HAS NOTHING TO SAY WITH THE QUALITY OF THE MEDIA OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME PEOPLE ARE GOOD ONLY LISTEN. AND TO SOCIAL MEDIA SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WATCH TELEVISION SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE A BILLBOARD SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO READ THE NEWSPAPER YOU HAVE TO DO A VARIETY OF THINGS BECAUSE YOU CAN COUNT ON ONE OR TWO VEHICLES TO GET EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT. SIMILAR AND IT -- VIEWERSHIP AB ETHNICITIES AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT FACTORS BUT MARKETING CAMPAIGNS HAVE A WHOLE MARKETING AGENCIES OF PEOPLE SO MEDIA HAVE REALLY HOLD THEIR ABILITY TO PINPOINT -- HOW TO SELL YOU A PRODUCT AND THE CENSUS IS IN A VERSION -- I KIND OF PRODUCT -- THE OTHER THING I BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT A REGIONAL APPROACH. I WOULDN'T. THE FIRST YEAR OF COVER CALIFORNIA WE LET OUT LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF GRANTS AND WE HAD PEOPLE AT FAIRS AND FARMERS MARKETS EVERY PLACE YOU CAN THINK OUT THERE WITH THEIR LITTLE. NOT KIOSK WOULD LIKE A TABLE AND BROCHURES AND THINGS TO HAND OUT. AND IT WAS AND PEOPLE WOULD COME TO BE YOU NEED TO PROMOTE WHEN I'M DOING OUT OF THE AT THE FARMERS MARKET. IN SOME CASES THERE WOULD BE A THOUSAND EVENTS. OVER A WEEKEND. SO YOU CAN'T REALLY PROMOTE A THOUSAND EVENTS AND WHAT WE ENDED UP DOING IS COLLAPSING THOSE AND HAVING THE DATES AND HAVING THE LOCATIONS AND ALL HAVE HAVING ALL POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE. SO THAT PEOPLE AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO TO THE WEBSITE TO FIND OUT WHERE THE EVENTS WERE SO THAT THEY CAN SIGN UP. BUT JUST AS TO DO AN AD FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE OF THOUSANDS OF FANS WOULD BE -- AND IN LOS ANGELES YOU KNOW THE EVENT IS ON THE WEST SIDE AND YOU KNOW EVERYBODY HERE IS IT BUT NOBODY'S GOING TO DRIVE FROM THE EAST SIDE TO THE WEST SIDE TO GO TO A FARMER'S MARKET UNLESS THIS IS ONE REALLY TERRIFIC FARMERS MARKET. SO -- BY COLLAPSING IT WOULD PUTTING ON A WEBSITE REALLY ALLOWED PEOPLE WHO JUST WANTED TO GO OUT AND FIND AN ACTIVITY LIKE THAT TO LOCATE THEM WITHOUT -- I'LL OR FIND ONE IN THEIR COMMUNITY THAT WAS EASIEST FOR THEM TO REACH. THANK THANK YOU OFFER FOR BEING HERE ACT -- SERVICE REPAIRS. LA. HUGE HATE -- AND YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES -- SO. ACTUALLY WELL YOU'RE A CBO YOU HEARD ACTUALLY EVEN FROM MEMBERS FROM LOS ANGELES SAYING WELL WE NEED TO FIND COOKIE I GUESS THAT'S THAT. SO I SO WHAT SO WHAT DO YOU SEE IS THE CHALLENGES FOR USE THE CBO RIGHT BECAUSE YES MONEY FROM THE STATE STATES GO SAY YOU NEED TO COUNT FOR ALL THE MONEY HERE'S OUR METRICS ETCETERA AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO AND DEBTS REASONABLE WE ACTUALLY DEMAND THAT OVER. AGENCIES. AND IN MEANTIME IS IS THAT -- THERE'S POKEY WHO. THEY USE THIRTY SOUNDS IT IS THIRTY DOES EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS. AND RIGHT WHO WHO KNOWS EVERYBODY NEIGHBORHOOD TO GET PEOPLE MOVING IF THEY NEED. TO FRANKLY ISN'T EVEN A ORGANIZATION RIGHTS PERSON. AND YOU KNOW TO GIVE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS SHE'S DOING SO -- SO WHAT HAS HAD HAD TO HIDE AND YOU'RE LIKE HEY I WANT TO HELP OUT WITH THE CENSUS. AND SHE'S LIKE WELL [inaudible] WHY? THE BETTER SO IT WAS A TO TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE IS THE CHALLENGES -- FOR THAT SO I COLLEAGUES ARE SAYING WELL WE NEED WE NEED TO WE NEED TO FIND AND GET COOKIE INVOLVED YEAH I THINK -- OBVIOUSLY THE FOUNDATION DIDN'T MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WE WERE IN APPLY FOR REGIONALLY CVO IT WASN'T UNTIL OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS CAME TO US AND SAID. HEY WE'D LIKE FOR YOU TO DO THIS YOU GUYS HOW THE BACKBONE TO DO IT YOU GUYS HAVE THE CAPACITY SO THAT WAS A RULE THAT WE WERE INTENTIONAL ABOUT TAKING. THAT BEING SAID BEFORE THAT WE WERE WORKING -- REALLY SINCE LAST YEAR TO RACE THAT TEN MILLION DOLLAR. POLLS FIND -- WITH OTHER FOUNDATIONS TO REALLY SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS. ONE OF OUR CONCERNS TO BE QUITE CANDID WITH SERVING AS A REGIONAL A CBO IT'S THE THE CONFINEMENT THAT SUCH A STRUCTURE CAN ALSO BRING YOU KNOW YOU ONLY GET THEIR MONEY AFTER YOU MEET A CERTAIN SET OF CRITERIA AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE YOU KNOW. WE HAVE TO SHOW PROOF YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE STATE. BUT GROUPS NEED THE MONEY RIGHT NOW ARM UP YOU KNOW THEIR CAPACITY THEY NEED -- A NEED MESSAGING NOW THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY CAN ACCOUNT -- FOR AND SO. I DO WORRY SOMETIMES THAT THE FUNDS THAT WILL TRICKLE BACK FROM REGIONALLY CBO WON'T BE AS FLEXIBLE -- AND ALSO WON'T BE IF TIMELY SO THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY CCF REGARDLESS ABOUT HAS CONTINUED TO SORT OF PARTNER WITH OTHERS -- IT WITH THE CITY OF LA TO REALLY SORT OF HAVE POOL A POOL FULL RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO MEET THOSE DEMANDS -- DOES THAT HELP ANSWER OKAY YET -- AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I KNOW THAT -- SOME OF BERMAN I AND WE BUT WE WENT DOWN -- TO HIS DISTRICT TO AND TALK TO SOME FOUNDATIONS I I DID IT I DO HEAR FROM US -- MY OWN COUNTY HERE ABOUT THE WELL -- SOME AREAS HAVE. MORE OR FEWER RESOURCES IN TERMS WE WE DID HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SOME THE FOUNDATIONS ABOUT TWELVE IN WHEN IT COMES TO GOVERNMENT MONEY. RIGHT. THERE'S OFTEN IT'S PUBLIC MONEY DIRECTORS STRINGS THAT HAVE TO BE ATTACHED STIRS LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT. MAKES IT MUCH HARDER TO GET DOWN TO THE GRASS ROOTS -- ARE YOU ARE YOU LOOKING AT ALSO IN ADDITION TO THIS OR THE STATE MONEY AND SO FORTH TO HAVING THIS CONVERSATION FOUNDATIONS OR SOMETHING WE CAN DO TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE FOUNDATIONS ALSO TO HELP GIVES I GUESS SOME MORE FLEXIBLE MONEY THAT MIGHT BE THAT THAT THE THAT MIGHT. BE HELPFUL IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET MONEY DOWN INTO THE GRASS ROOTS. ALL ALSO. SHARE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE TO DATE IN TERMS FOR ME PLAN -- TO OUR CAMPAIGN WAS TO REALLY SATISFIED -- FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE FOR RAPID RESPONSE GRANTS THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW UNTIL MARCH TWENTY TWENTY HITS. SO MAYBE THE STATE CAN ALSO THINK OF SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT LIKE HAVING A RESERVE THAT'S REALLY YOU KNOW SMALL GRANTS WORK WE DON'T HAVE TO PULL SO MANY STRINGS ATTACHED IT'S REALLY JUST. A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PRINT COPIES YOU KNOW. A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET SUPPORT FROM YOU KNOW A CONSULTANT TO REACH X. Y. Z. OR TO HIRE. STAFF YOU KNOW THAT CAN GO OUT THERE AND DO COUNTY SEEING -- PROVIDES CAN SING SUPPORT OR YOU KNOW KNOCK DOOR TO DOOR SERVICES SO. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I YOU KNOW I WOULD RECOMMEND I THINK. DS AND YOU KNOW THE THE COMPLETE -- COUNT COMMITTEE HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB AT KEEPING YOU KNOW CONVERSATIONS VERY OPEN WITH FOUNDATIONS I THINK WE INVITE MORE -- THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING. THE WAIT FOUNDATIONS ALSO PARTICIPATE ADD AS PART OF THE STATE WIDE FOUNDATIONS TABLE SO THE OF PART BANDAGES COMING TOGETHER TO REALLY TALK ABOUT THE CENSUS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE CONSTANTLY DISCUSSING. IS HOW DO WE PLAN TOGETHER WITH THE STATE WE DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S HARD TO MAKE FUNDING DECISIONS BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE. OUR STAKEHOLDERS THAT YOU KNOW DEMAND CERTAIN THINGS OUT OF US AND ALSO ONE TRANSPARENCY AND THAT WANT TO KNOW THAT WERE REALLY USING OR STEWARDING RESOURCES APPROPRIATELY RIGHT LOOK SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CONTINUE TO GET HIT WHEN WE TALK TO OTHER. FOUNDATIONS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO INVEST IN THE CENSUS IS WELL WHY STEPHANIE AT LIKE THE STATE HAS YOU KNOW RELEASED ALL THIS AMOUNT. YOU HAVE THIS AMOUNT SO WHAT'S REALLY WHAT'S THE NEED -- OUT THERE AND UNTIL WE KNOW AT A SLOWER PACE. WE JUST DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE SO I THINK AGAIN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AND MORE PLANNING MEETINGS TOGETHER I THINK IT'S A WELCOME OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE HAD SOME BUT I THINK. IT COULD BE THAT WOULD BE GREAT. ESPECIALLY AS WE START TO THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW ETHNIC MEDIA -- OUT REACHING TO THEM IN CREATING -- MEDIA PARTNERSHIPS I SEE THE STATE'S SORT OF TAKING ON THAT LEADERSHIP ROLE AND REALLY NEGOTIATING THE BIG CONTRACTS BUT ALSO PARTNERING WITH FOUNDATIONS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND AND THAT ARE THINKING MORE REGIONALLY AT AT WHAT CAN WE TAKE ON LIKE FOR EXAMPLE RADIO IN LA. AND AN ORANGE COUNTY IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IT ACTUALLY -- HAS SHOWN THAT IT HAS IT REACHES THE AUDIENCES THAT WE WANT SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE BIG YOU KNOW LACKEY NO NETWORK THAT WE NEED -- IT MIGHT BE THAT SO WHO'S GOING A FEW SCHOLARSHIP BILLS LIKE THE SMALLER MEDIA STATIONS HOW DO WE PARTNER TO KNOW THAT TO IT TOO YOU KNOW COLLECTIVELY WITH THE STATE TO KNOW THAT LIKE HEY YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HANDLE THIS PIECE THIS IS WHERE PLAN TO BE. CAN COMING -- MESSAGE TESTING AND PLATFORM I KNOW YOU KNOW. FOUNDATIONS LIKE MYSELF HAVE INVESTED IN IT INCLUDING AN ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN BERNARDINO FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE THERE WERE NO FUNDING PARTNERS DOING ANYTHING IN THAT REGION AND SO WE KNEW. THAT. DOING IT NOW MIGHT BE TOO LATE BECAUSE BY THE FALL EARLY NEXT YEAR. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO BE READY. SO -- THINKING ABOUT MAYBE LIKE A WEBSITE THAT -- MAYBE THE STATE CAN ALSO HELP US MANAGE OR AGAIN PAY FOR WHERE NON PROFITS -- OR COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS CAN REALLY ACCESS THAT MESSAGING THAT HAS BEEN ALREADY VETTED IN CUSTOMER -- CUSTOMIZE AND THEY CAN TAKE THAT AND ALSO REPORT BACK ON IT OR ALSO TAKE THOSE LEARNING THANK CREATE. CONTENT THAT IS CUTS MY CITY THAT COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE SO. RIGHT THANK YOU -- AND THEN ESPECIALLY -- THOMAS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN MY DISTRICT. YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THAT AND I THINK WHAT WE AND THE THE SPENCE IS RELATED TO THAT IS I THINK THAT I I UNDERSTAND IT'S ONE THE REASONS THAT YOU THINK SACRAMENTO SERVE UNDER FUNDED TERMS OF BE ABLE TO HAVE ENOUGH. MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IS THAT DO YOU SEE THAT IT'S THE STATE THAT SHOULD PROVIDE THE MATERIALS AND REYES DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THAT CAN BE DELIVERED ARE WE LOOKING AT LOCAL I MEAN -- WHERE DOES THE THE IT AND TO REALLY TAKE PLACE -- AND ALSO I RECOGNIZE THAT CERTAINLY SOME OF THE LANGUAGES ACTUALLY. FOR MAY COMMUNITIES ARE NOT PRIMARILY I MEAN THAT ARE PROBABLY WRITTEN RIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY VERBAL OR SOMETHING SO IT'S NOT LIKE -- I CAN JUST PRINT OUT A BUNCH OF FLYERS IN THAT LANGUAGE AND THAT'S GOING TO WORK SO COULD YOU SPEAK. TO TO THE SECOND MOST COUNTIES CHALLENGES REGARDING LANGUAGE AND AND AND THEM OUT OF FUNDING YOU HAVE. THANK YOU -- YES AND SO IT IS IT IS THE THE ASPECT OF DIFFERENT CULTURES AND DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THEY COMMUNICATE IN WHAT MESSAGING WORKS WITH ONE DOESN'T WORK -- WITH ANOTHER. AND SO -- THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THEY DO KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH FOLKS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES -- BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE JEWEL CONTACTS AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE A FAR FAR BROADER. GROUP OF OF INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO REACH OUT IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW DIVERSE WAYS YOU KNOW IT WITHIN THE COMMUNITY VERSES. IF WE HAD THE SAME NUMBER THAT WERE -- THAT WAS YOU KNOW ME BEING MOSTLY YOU KNOW VIETNAMESE AND HISPANIC YOU KNOW IS IT TOO AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW THIRTY PLUS YOU KNOW TYPE. SO THERE'S THE THE INCREASED AMOUNT IN IN BEING ABLE. TO CREATE WE HAVE TO CREATE DIFFERENT MESSAGING FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND AND AND COMMUNITIES AND AND I THINK THOSE WERE DISCUSSED EARLIER ABOUT THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE WAY THAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT -- AND THEN THE OTHER IS AND AND WE WE WE TOTALLY SUPPORT -- TO LANGUAGE ACCESS AND AND AND MAKING SURE THAT THINGS ARE ACCEPTABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS OF OF ALL DIFFERENT YOU KNOW DISABILITIES OR ABILITIES -- AND AND SO WITH THAT IT'S NOT A YOU KNOW A ONE OFF OF YOU KNOW YOU CREATE THIS AND THEN AND THEN YOU PUT IT OUT AGAIN DIFFERENT GROUPS COMMUNICATE AND AND WE'VE BEEN -- YOU KNOW FOLKS HAVE GOT DIFFERENT HEARING IT LISTENING DEVICES YOU KNOW WE CAN HAVE A TRANSLATOR IT'S IT'S STILL DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW QUITE ACCURATE SO WERE OR WANTING TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS FROM THIS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS MORE SPECIFICALLY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW WHERE THEY CAN TALK WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS AND SO THEY THEY SEE THAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT OR OR COLLEGE STUDENT THAT'S BEEN IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND NOW. YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALSO SHOWING UP A COMMUNITY MEETINGS THAT'S PART OF THE COMMUNITY BUILDING YOU KNOW THAT WERE ALSO TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THE THROUGH THIS -- THE STATE WIDE BASIS IS TWO ONE ONE AND THEY OFFER TRANSLATION SERVICES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S OFFERED. ACROSS THE STATE -- AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO GROW THAT CAPACITY I THROUGHPUT YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY A STATE CONTRACT BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU YOU KNOW CALL 211- AND YOU NEED A TRANSLATOR SOMEBODY STILL HAS TO PAY THAT COST AND SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S FACTORED INTO OUR BUDGET -- YOU KNOW WE ARE BUILDING A WEBSITE FOR THE COUNTY AND FOR A RESIDENTS BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE IN SIX DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ARE MAINTAINED IN SIX DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. IT SHOULD BE -- BUT AGAIN IT TAKES ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO TO TO DO THAT TYPE OF THING. SO YOU KNOW AGAIN YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S THE DIVERSE THE NATURE OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF OF CULTURES AND LANGUAGES. THAT THEN JUST MAKES REPLICATION OF OF ALL OUT REACH A LITTLE BIT MORE COSTLY MUCH NEEDED YOU KNOW BUT THAT ADDS TO THE COST. SO I WOULD YEAH. I WOULD ADD ONE THING TO YOUR CONVERSATION -- I THINK THAT THERE'S IN SOME WAYS A BENEFIT FOR THE STATE TO DO A LOT OF THE TRANSLATING. SPEAK ADD MAKING I UNIVERSAL OR EVERGREEN PIECES SO THAT PEOPLE COULD MAYBE PUT THERE ARE LIKE STAMP. PRINTED TO PERSONALIZE IT -- BECAUSE THE THINK OF A TERRACE AND I HAVE A PERSONAL PREJUDICE ABOUT TRANSLATING. BOB EVERY DOCUMENT EVER WRITTEN THAT ISN'T PUBLICLY RELEASED I HAD AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE READ IT AFTER I WROTE IT TO MAKE SURE WAS RIGHT. AND WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES BUT THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE WITH TRANSLATIONS WERE PEOPLE ASSUME BECAUSE A PERSON SPEAKS VIETNAMESE THEY ARE TRANSLATING IT PERFECTLY. AND IT JUST AS YOU WOULD DO IT IN ENGLISH AND YOU WOULD HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE REVIEW IT YOU NEED TO HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE LOOK AT IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NOTHING LOST IN THE TRANSLATION. AND SO THAT'S I THINK A JOB IS EASIER THAN IN THE STATE WIDE BASIS AND THE PERSONALIZED TO THE COUNTY BECAUSE I THINK THAT MANY COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR THE RATE RESOURCES OUR CAPACITY TO TRANSLATE INTO THE NUMBER OF LANGUAGES JUST THE BASIC LIKE WHICH IS. NOT THE UNIQUE LANGUAGES THE BASIC LANGUAGES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED [inaudible] THANK YOU. RIGHT WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR FOR BEING HERE I KNOW THAT THAT'S RUNNING LATE. AND STAND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A SINGLE PLANE BESTS HUH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PERSONS FOR BEING HERE AND AND THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING WHAT YOU HAD SURE THE IT'S BEEN VERY. VALUABLE INFORMATIVE TO US NOW THANK YOU PLEASURE THANKS MUCH OKAY SO -- I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT IT WAS A SIGN UP SHEET THERE IF PEOPLE WANT TO LINE UP AT THE MICROPHONE -- GONNA ASK IF YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP YOUR COMMENT TO A MINUTE. AND ALWAYS FEEL FREE TO SUBMIT AND WELL THE SO -- AND I SHE ACTUALLY THINKS THAT MICROPHONE OVER THERE USE THAT. ONE OKAY AND THE OTHERS SIGN IN SHEET SO THAT WAY WE HAD WE KNOW WHO. SO YOU SAY YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION AT THEN -- YOUR YOUR YOUR COMMENT. HI AM CRAZY CASTRUM NAVAJO AND THE CHAIR OF THE LA CITY COUNTY NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN COMMISSION I WANTED TO JUST ADD TO SENATOR BERMAN COMMENTS ABOUT THE FUNDING ALLOCATION TO TRIBES -- MOST TRIBES ARE RECEIVING AS ZERO DOLLARS OR ONE THOUSAND OR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO CONDUCT OUTREACH WHICH IS SORELY INSUFFICIENT FOR SUCH A HARD TO COUNT OUR POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO -- YOU KNOW NATIVE PEOPLES NATIONALLY IN THE LAST CENSUS WERE THE HARDEST ACCOUNT WE'RE IF WE HAD A 5% UNDER COUNT WHICH IS TWICE AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER POPULATION -- AND THERE'S STILL TIME TO CORRECT THIS SOME REALLY APPEALING TO THOSE BODIES LEADERSHIP TO INVESTIGATE THIS AND TO REALLY SUPPORT AUGMENTATION OF FUNDING AND I WILL BE SUBMITTING A LETTER WITH A LOT MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CENTER SEE AROUND SANTANA REPRESENTING CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WE ARE A COMMUNITY BASED CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO'S CHINATOWN. AND SINCE OUR INCEPTION IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE WE HAVE WORKED ON THE CENSUS FOR THE LAST FIVE DECADES. OUR COMMITMENT REMAINS THE SAME IS TO HELP ENSURE AN ACCURATE COUNT OF OUR HARD TO REACH POPULATIONS. THIS LAST WEEK THE STATE CENSUS OFFICE WRISTS A RELEASE THEIR DRAFT LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN. AND WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT THAT PLAN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE FEDERAL EFFORTS AND THE LOCAL EFFORTS. SO WE ALONG WITH OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- THE FEDERAL BUREAU SAID PLAN IN REACHING OUR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT COMMUNITIES AND OUR MANY DIVERSE -- LANGUAGE COMMUNITIES SO IN CHAU THE FEDERAL BUREAU STE PLAN ACTUALLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENTS WHO ARE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT WHO ARE REFUGEES ASIANS PACIFIC ISLANDERS. LANGUAGES OF LESSER DIFFUSION AND ARE NON WRITTEN LANGUAGES -- AND SO. GIVEN I THINK IN ADDITION THIS MAKES OUR LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN EVEN MORE CRITICAL AND IT'S EVEN MORE CRITICAL BECAUSE THIS LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN WILL INFORM. THE STATE'S. OUTREACH EFFORTS AND IT WILL INFORM THE STATE'S MEDIA EFFORTS SO -- MISTER HOWARD TALKED ABOUT THE GROUND GAME IF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO RUIN THE GROUND GAME WE MUST MAKE SURE OUR LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN IS REALLY -- OPERATIONAL AND SO I IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL JUST GIVE YOU ARE ONE PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE PLAN FOCUS ON OPERATIONALIZE SEEING HOW LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. IN SPECIFIC LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT COMMUNITIES INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES NOT -- YOU KNOW THAT SPEAK IN. THE MIST ECHO OR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND FAILURE TO DO SO. BUT TO CONFRONT THESE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES WILL REALLY JEOPARDIZE THE EFFICACY OF ALL THE STATE CENSUS DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN INVESTED THANK YOU. Q.
