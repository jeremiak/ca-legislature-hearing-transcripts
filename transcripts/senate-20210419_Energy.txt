AND IN THIS BILL WE WILL BE LIMITED TESTIMONY TO FIFTEEN. MINUTES PER SIDE FIFTEEN MINUTES OF SUPPORT FIFTEEN MINUTES IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE ORGANIZED PRESENTATIONS IN SUPPORT. AND ORGANIZE PRESENTATIONS IN OPPOSITION AND SUPPORT WILL HAVE RUDY RUDY RADIUS. AND BARBARA NEMCO IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE SUSAN FOSTER AND PULL. TOGETHER AND WE WILL BEGIN OF FIVE BY HEARING THE OPENING PRESENTATION BY THE AUTHOR CENTER DOT WELCOME. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SB FIVE FIVE SIX WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA INTO CONFORMANCE WITH EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW SEEKING TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I'M ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I WANT TO THANK THE CONSULTANT HELPING TO REFINE THE LANGUAGE ON ISSUES PERTAINING TO AESTHETIC STANDARDS AND TIMING. DEMAND FOR RELIABLE HIGH SPEED BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER THAN IT IS TODAY. THE CODE NINETY PANDEMIC HAS ONLY ELEVATED THE EXTENT TO WHICH BROADBAND ACCESS. ACCESS SKEWS ME HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL FOR PARTICIPATING VIRTUALLY IN EVERY ASPECT OF MODERN SOCIETY. ASSESSABLE RELIABLE BROADBAND NETWORKS ARE NOW MORE THAN EVER CRITICAL IN OUR DAILY LIVES. IT TOO MANY HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS THE STATE CAN'T ACCESS BROADBAND BECAUSE IT'S NOT AVAILABLE WHERE THEY LIVE. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WORLD POPULATIONS AND WORKING FAMILIES WHO LACK BROADBAND RISKS FALLING FURTHER BEHIND. AS LEARNING IS SHIFTED ONLINE STUDENTS MAY STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP ADULTS AND COMMUNITIES WITHOUT INTERNET ACCESS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEARCH AND APPLY FOR JOBS WORKING REMOTELY START BUSINESSES OR ACCESS EDUCATION SOCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED TO THRIVE IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. SB FIVE FIVE SIX WILL DRESS THOSE NEEDS BY CONFORMING CALIFORNIA LAW WITH THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FCC- FEDERAL REGULATION IN ORDER TO EXPAND FIVE G. DEPLOYMENT. IN ALSO TO CONTRIBUTE TO CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THIS BILL REQUIRES. I THINK. THIS BILL REQUIRES LOCALITIES TO GIVE ACCESS TO THE STREET LIGHTS AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLES IN ORDER FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO ATTACH THEIR WIRELESS FACILITIES THE BILL FOCUSES ON ENSURING THAT ACCESS TO THOSE TOOLS IS PROVIDED AT A NON DISCRIMINATORY COST BASED RATE. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE FCC ISSUED AN INFRASTRUCTURE ORDER THAT REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE A COST BASED RATE FOR TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO ATTACH WIRELESS FACILITIES TO STREET LIGHTING TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLES THE FCC ESTIMATED THAT THE PRESUMPTIVE NOT DISCRIMINATORY RATE. AT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS. HOWEVER MANY LOCALITIES IN CALIFORNIA STILL REFUSED TO OBEY THE FCC ORDER. THERE'S BEEN WIDESPREAD RESISTANCE NOT COMPLIANCE IT CONTINUED LITIGATION OVER THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ORDER. SB FIVE FIVE SIX WILL CREATE UNIFORMITY WITH THE FCC ORDER BY FIRST OFFERING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE OPTION TO CONFORM TO THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS FCC PRESUMPTIVE RATE. WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO NOT WISH TO APPLY THAT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLAR RATE THE OPTION OF USING A COST PLEASE. READ ATTACHMENT FORMULA THAT IS MODELED AFTER AB. TEN TWENTY SEVEN PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. THAT COSBY'S FORMULA HAS BEEN USED BY THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES FOUR YEARS. IT IS NOT APPLIED IT IS QUITE BY THE CPUC TO INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND TELEPHONE COMPANIES AS WELL. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS IS REALLY A SAFE HARBOR FOR LOCALITIES TO CHOOSE NOT TO APPLY THE FEE CALCULATION THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL PROHIBITING THEM TO COME UP WITH A HIGHER RATE% AFTER THEY COMPLETED THEIR- COST STUDY. FINALLY AUTHORS AMENDMENTS MOVED SINCE SUBSTANTIVE LANGUAGE OF SB FIVE FIVE SIX INTO A STANDALONE PUBLIC UTILITY CODE SECTION. TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE PO USE THAN A CABLE ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS ALIGNING THE LANGUAGE ON REASONABLE COSTS WITH THE LANGUAGE IN THE FCC TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ORDER. TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ARTICULATED BY THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE AMONG STAKEHOLDERS IN MY TEAM CENTER DOT I HATE TO INTERRUPT YOU WE HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM. DEALING WITH ARE THE QUORUM LOSE TELEVISION THE VOTE WE TOOK BECAUSE WE MAY LOSE SOME MEMBERS I WANT TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM SO WITH THIS COMMITTEE COMING FORWARD- WE'RE GOING TO NOTIFY THE LAST SOLO AND I'M GONNA ASK THE CLERK TO.

STERN JOINING THEM. SURE NOW YOU HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU SENATE OFFICE PLEASE CONTINUE. THE DALLAS ON A ROLL THEIR MISTER CHAIRMAN TO SCAN UP BRIEFLY HE- GOOD FAITH. HAVE BEEN TAKING AMONG STAKEHOLDERS MY TEAM WHILE THE AMENDMENTS OF ADDRESS SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS I KNOW THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO AND I'M COMMITTED TO DOING THAT I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH LEADERS FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND OTHERS I FEEL LIKE THIS IS- VERY DOABLE. ON THE PHONE IS BARBARA NEMCO FROM THE NAPA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND IN THE GALLERY IS- RUDY RAY IS FROM VERIZON HERE TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. OKAY SO- WILL WILL- WILL ASK THE SPEAKERS IN THE ORDER THAT YOU INTRODUCED ON BEGINNING WITH BARBARA NEMCO IF SHE'S ON THE PHONE. I AM THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY I'VE BEEN THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS IN NAPA FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND WE HAVE BEEN INTEGRATING TECHNOLOGY INTO EVERYTHING WE DO BUT WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT AND WE HAD TO PUT THE TWO CHILDREN DOING REMOTE LEARNING MORE DISTANCE LEARNING. WE DID WHAT MOST EXPECTED WE WENT OUT WE PURCHASE DEVICES FOR ANY CHILD WHO DIDN'T HAVE ONE THE PURCHASE TALK ABOUT THEM WE SEND THEM HOME. BUT THE PROBLEM IS A HOT SPOT WON'T WORK IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR IT TO CONNECT TO. AND SO WHO GOT HURT BY THAT THE KIDS IN THE MOST RURAL AREAS THE KIDS IN THE POOREST AREAS WHO DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEAR THEIR HOME. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE HOMEWORK GAP FOUR YEARS FOR THE KIDS WHO DON'T HAVE APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE COMPARE IT TO HAVING ELECTRICITY BACK IN THE DAY. IT'S CRITICAL THAT EVERY CHILD HAD THE APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE NOT JUST IN SCHOOL BUT AT HOME AND YET ONE IN EIGHT HOMES IN CALIFORNIA STILL DOES NOT HAVE THAT. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE THE BURDEN FALLS SO I AM REALLY CONCERNED ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH LEARNING LOSS. WE HAVE GOT TO GET HIS LESSONS ARE EXCITING AND INTERACTIVE AND PERSONALIZED AND MOTIVATING AND WE CAN DO THAT WITH TECHNOLOGY BUT NOT IF THEY CAN'T USE IT AT HOME. I URGE YOU TO PLEASE. BRING CALIFORNIA INTO CONFORMANCE WITH EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW AND I ASK YOU RESPECTFULLY TO VOTE. ON THIS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL LEGISLATION THANKS. VERY MUCH WE'RE GOOD RUDY RADIUS. IN THANK YOU CHAIRMAN OF THE CAN- THAT YOU SENATOR FOR ALLOWING ME TO. NEXT TO YOU IT AT LEAST IN THE JUST TO A- TO SUPPORT. YOUR CALIFORNIA. ACT WHICH IS VITAL FOR DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. STATEWIDE- THE SENATOR AND AUTHOR. AND THE LAST SPEAKER WENT THROUGH WHAT THE BILL DOES- IN IN SHORT. IT HOLDS FEDERAL LAW IN REQUIRING LOCALITIES TO MAKE THEIR POLL INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE ON REASONABLE. NON DISCRIMINATORY AND COST BASED. METHOD FOR WIRELESS ATTACHMENT IN ORDER FOR US TO DEPLOY A FIVE G. AT SCALE ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA- THE CENTER WENT THROUGH WHAT THE BILL DOES LET ME JUST FOR A MOMENT ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND CLARIFY WHAT THE BILL DOES NOT DO. SOME HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS THE SECOND COMING OF SHERMAN WAY SAYS SB SIX FORTY NINE FIRST FROM SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND THAT WAS ALSO A GREAT HONOR. BUT THAT BILL DID GET VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. HE LIKED THE BILL BUT HE SAID WE NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME IN THE MEANTIME THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION DID ADOPT THE GUTS OF SHERMAN WAY SAYS BILL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TODAY IS THAT NUMEROUS CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO RESIST CONTINUED TO NOT COMPLY WITH THE- FCC DECISION. AND SAID WE'RE SEEING WIDESPREAD DELAYS AND RED TAPE AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. WHICH IS EXACERBATING THE PROBLEM OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE SO WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO IS IT WILL SAY THAT IT WILL BRING CALIFORNIA INTO COMPLIANCE WITH FCC REGULATIONS. IT WOULD ESTABLISH A COST FORMULA THAT IS ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA ALONG APPLICABLES TO THE TELEPHONE COMPANIES TO THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES. BUT ALSO HAVE TO MAKE THEIR POLLS AVAILABLE FOR ATTACHMENT AT COST BASED RATES THEY WOULD TAKE THAT. FORMULA AND APPLY IT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THEIR STREET LIGHT POLES AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLES. THE BILL WOULD PRESERVE ALL LOCAL CONTROL OVER THE PLACEMENT AND SIDING OF THIS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE- I SO LONG AS IT IS DONE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. IT WOULD PRESERVE LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER STATICS AND AMENDMENTS THAT WERE- TAKEN BY THE AUTHOR AND ALSO SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE FURTHER CLARIFIED THAT. IT CONTAINS A GRANDFATHERING CLAUSE THAT WOULD PRESERVE EXISTING AGREEMENTS IN EXISTING DEPLOYMENTS BUT PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO. TO ACCELERATE DEPLOYMENT ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND LASTLY IN CLOSING I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IF THE AUTHOR IN THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE ME TO. I WOULD SAY THAT THIS BILL THANK YOU PLEASE CONCLUDE YOUR COMMENTS OVER THREE MINUTES. IT AT THIS BILL- WHILE VITAL IS NOT A SILVER BULLET THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION COMING ACROSS OUR DESKS LATER THAT WILL ADDRESS OTHER PARTS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THANK YOU MR REYES APPRECIATE. EVEN PART OF THIS PROCESS NOW WILL GO TO- THE- GALLERY IF THERE ARE ANY SPEAK- SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT.

SENATOR EGGMAN THEN FOLLOWED BY CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- SO I HAVE HEARD FROM MY COMMITTEES AT MY CITIES WERE UP ON OPPOSITION TODAY AND I'VE HEARD FROM A ANOTHER MAYOR. HI AS I UNDERSTAND IT. SENATOR DO YOU NEED THERE'S STILL SOME CONFUSION WITH THIS BILL OVER THE BILL OF OUR STEAM CHAIR PRESENTED A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND THE LANDSCAPE SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN. SO I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I THINK YOU THEY'RE STILL IN WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THAT EVERYBODY ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL DOES BEFORE IT MOVES OFF THIS FLOOR. SO AMBER APPEARED TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY. AND ASK YOU TO WORK ON THAT TO REALLY TAKE THE CONVERSATION I THINK OUTSIDE OUR BUILDING SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. BUT JUST FOR THE POINT OF CLARIFICATION TODAY CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT SELF FIRED CELL TOWER FIRES BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE COUNTER. INTUITIVE TO WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD REDUCE IF WE HAD TO HAVE LESS BIG TOWERS AND MORE JUST THINGS ON SMALLER POOLS THAT ARE ALREADY ALREADY OUT AND ABOUT CAN YOU CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEPARATE BECAUSE YOU'RE SPOT ON ON. ON TAT ISSUE BUT- INSTEAD OF ME GIVING I'D RATHER HAVE A TECHNICAL- DESCRIPTION DANCE OF MISTER RAY IS. IS STILL ON THE LINE MISTER CHAIR IF YOU WOULD ALLOW HIM TO RESPOND TO THAT WITH THE EXACT TECHNICAL INFORMATION PLEASE. YES MYSTERY IS WOULD YOU LIKE TO- COMMENT ON THAT. AS YOU MAY COMMENTS TO THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED YES MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR AND THANK YOU CENTER AND THEN- YOU'RE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT SENATOR DODD THIS BILL WOULD- PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WHEN THERE'S A FIRE YOU REALLY NEED ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE SERVICE SO THIS BILL IS GONNA. AT INCREASE SERVICE ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE REFERENCED FIGHTERS FROM SOME OF THE SPEAKERS WERE TO LOVE WIRELINE AND OTHER ISSUES THEY WERE VERY DISCREET TO MALIBU AND THAT ISSUE OCCURRED YEARS AND YEARS AGO WAS ADDRESSED BY THE PC AND IS BEING ADDRESSED RIGHT NOW. ARE YOU SATISFIED CENTER EGGMAN YES THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU BYE CENTER GROW. THANK YOU I AM MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THE FOR THE AUTHOR IF AT THROUGH THE CHAIR HE'D BE WILLING TO TAKE THEM. SENATOR WE'VE GOT YES PLEASE SENATOR DODD SO- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING- AS READING YOUR BILL- THAT THIS DOES NOT CREATE AN AMBIGUITY BUT KINDA CENTRALIZES OR MAKES THINGS LEVEL ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS DIFFERENT CITIES TO MAKE DIFFERENT RULES OR DIFFERENT AND THE SCHEDULES DIFFERENT AND YOU KNOW REGULATORY PROCESSES AND THIS STILL KIND OF JUST STREAMLINES IT SO THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY CAN. AND INTO THE INFRASTRUCTURE UP THAT WE NEED FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATION- ACROSS THE STATE EVEN A REAL COMMUNITIES MY RIGHT OR WRONG. YOU'RE RIGHT SAID IN A GRAVE. OKAY M. SO IT DOESN'T CREATE AMBIGUITY INCREASE CONSISTENCY I HAD TO CITIES THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION I TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT THEY NEEDED AND YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM AND THEY HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION BECAUSE YOU WERE SO GRACIOUS TO WORK WITH THEM SO I THINK YOU FOR THAT AND THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAD IS THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT THIS YOUR BILL REMOVES MONEY FROM WILDFIRE PROTECTION- WELFARE- AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE EITHER I THINK YOU GET A PORTION. OF CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS IN MY NOT RIGHT I'M I COULD BE WRONG ON THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE FUNDING MECHANISM COMES FROM BUT IT'S THIS MONEY DOES NOT COME FROM WELFARE PROTECTION OR WILDFIRE MITIGATION. I CONSIDER GROW BY PRITCHETT THE QUESTION BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T WIN THESE. RUMORS ARE OUT THERE THAT REALLY DETRACTS FROM. THE EFFICACY OF THIS BILL AND- NONE OF THE MONEY. I'M NOT EVEN SURE THERE'S ANY GOVERNMENT MONEY. GOING TO THIS EFFORT THIS IS MONEY THAT'S BEING. PAID BY THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS. INDUSTRY SO NO STATE MONEY. PROBABLY NO STATEMENT I'M JUST GONNA SAY PROBABLY NO STATE MONEY IS GOING HERE AT ALL- BUT I WILL TELL YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY NO MONEY THAT IS DESIGNATED. FOR WILDFIRE- EITHER SUPPRESSION OR PREVENTION IS GOING HERE. OKAY AND- I KNOW THIS QUESTION MAY BE A LITTLE OUT THERE ESPECIALLY IN THIS FLOOR. BUT OU'RE NOT PURPOSELY PUTTING THIS BILL FORWARD SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BE SPIED ON CORRECT. THAT COULD BE WHAT. THERE IS A LOT OF ACCUSATIONS ABOUT IN THE OPPOSITION THAT THIS BILL WILL FURTHER ALLOW GOVERNMENT TO SPY ON THEM THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE I COULDN'T SEE ANY OF THAT IN THIS BILL YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT THAT'S NOT YOUR INTENT THOUGH THAT HAS. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH IT THIS THE INTENT OF THIS BILL INTO THIS BILL IT'S CLEAR IN TERMS OF GETTING MORE CONNECTIVE ITTY WITH ALL OUR MUTUAL CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU SIR- I DO WANT TO TELL YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING WITH MY CITIES AND THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAD WITH THE BILL WHICH YOU ADDRESSED IN ITS I'D BE GLAD TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU AND- OKAY WILL COME TO. POOR JUST AND THEN GONZALEZ BUT I WANTED TO WRAP UP THAT QUESTION. THAT SENATOR GROVE ASKED JUST TO I AM VERY CLEAR THAT NO STATE MONEY WILL BE USED. IN IMPLEMENTING THE ROLLOUT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY I'M VERY CERTAIN ABOUT THAT I DON'T HAVE A DON'T MIND QUESTION IS THERE ANY RATEPAYER MONEY. BEING USED IN MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS AND FOR THAT I WANT TO GO TO- MISTER RAY IS- DO YOU KNOW THAT IS POSSIBLE AT ANY RATE PAYER AT LEAST- ANY FUNDS I DON'T KNOW THAT- EVEN THE PC CAN AUTHORIZE THAT BUT- RATEPAYER MONEY USED FOR. THE ROLLING OUT OF THE SYSTEM MAYBE THROUGH SOME OF OUR- BILLS THAT. INTENDS TO ROLLOUT CONNECTIVITY. IS THAT. I WE NEED NORMALLY THAT MONEY IS USED IN UNDERSERVED AREAS BUT- IS THERE ANYTHING RELATED IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD USE RATEPAYER MONEY TO ROLL OUT THE SYSTEM ARE ALL THOSE BE A 100% PRIVATE INVESTMENTS AB CHAIRMAN THIS WILL BE 1100% PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY- WE HAVE CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS WE- WE'RE NOT. RATE REGULATED BY THE COMMISSION OKAY THIS IS SUBSIDY OKAY BUT WE HAVE ADVANCED SERVICES FUND MONEY AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT NONE OF THAT WOULD. BE USED. ACT OKAY WE'LL GO- CENTER BORCHERS FOLLOWED BY CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH A BUNCH OF FOLKS ON THIS ISSUE. AND I KNOW THAT SOME FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT- HAVE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS TO THIS BILL- BELIEVED IN THE CITY OF CLOVIS JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE. HAS EXPRESSED OPPOSITION BUT THE DEEPER I'VE HAD A CATION HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE FOLKS. IS THAT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR IS TAKEN. OFF FROM THE COMMITTEE AND THE CONVERSATIONS ARE STILL. ONGOING SO THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS. SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT I THINK ARE WORTH MENTIONING. IS THAT THIS WOULD THAT THESE WOULD ONLY GO ON EXISTING. POLLS IN THE TRANSMISSION RIGHT OF WAY THAT THIS IS- NOT GOING INTO- ON REGULATED OR ON AUTHORIZED. YES AND IF I MAY ALSO ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU CAN JUST KIND OF JUST GENERICALLY CONFIRM THAT THESE ARE SOME OF THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE SECOND IS THAT IT WOULD STANDARDIZE THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT WOULD BE. CHARGED TO THE CARRIER OR PROVIDER. ON A MORE- A FORMULAIC BASIS BASED ON WHAT IS BEING CHARGED FOR THE TELEPHONE POLES FOR EXAMPLE THE AESTHETICS IN BEAUTIFICATION- AUTHORITY STILL REMAINS WITH THE MUNICIPALITY WHERE THE RELEVANT ON A GOVERNMENT ENTITY. SO LONG AS IT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS ALREADY ON THE POLLS AND- THE TRANSMISSION AREAS- I THINK MAKING CERTAIN THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT SPEED. WHETHER B. TWO FIVE G. AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE G. A. STILL CONSTRUCTION MY HEAD AS WERE ALREADY MAKING INROADS INTO A SIX G. WORLD- BUT NONETHELESS THESE ARE IMPORTANT- INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENTS. THAT ARE COMMUNITIES NEED AND NO DOUBT THIS WILL BE MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS URBAN AREA. BUT WE HAVE DESPERATE NEED OF FOR THESE TYPES OF TRANSMISSION SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN RURAL AREAS IN A COVE IT HIGHLIGHTED ALL OF THAT I HAD TWO KIDS HAD TO GO TO SCHOOL REMOTELY JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DID OR HAD. RELATIVES OR FRIENDS IN THAT SITUATION. HAVING ACCESS TO SPEED IN THIS TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE. IS JUST NOW IN ESSENTIAL LEVEL OF SERVICE. SO I WILL GO FURTHER THAN THAT EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT. EVEN THOUGH I HAVE RECEIVED CONCERNS FROM. FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT I TAKE THEM VEY SERIOUSLY AT THIS POINT. YOU KNOW ONE AS A MATTER OF COURTESY BUT ALSO I THINK WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THEY'LL BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS TODAY. I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT ITS FINAL VERSION WILL LOOK LIKE- WHAT HITS THE FLOOR BECAUSE THINGS CAN CHANGE. AND I KNOW THAT- THE AUTHOR IS A MAN OF HIS WORD AND HE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH. WITH FOLKS TO TRY TO RESOLVE. MOST OF THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES IF I CAN JUST GET CONFIRMATION FROM THE AUTHOR. THESE ARE GENERALLY- AGREED UPON POINTS. THE CHAIR. THE CHAIR YES CENTER BOARDS- I THINK YOU'RE CORRECTED HOW YOU VOTE FRAMED IT. THE WHOLE INTENT OF THIS IS- THIS WHOLE PROGRAM IS SO. NEW POLLS WON'T HAVE TO BE PUT IN AN AD- THE COSTS BORNE- YOU KNOW TO DO THAT HOWEVER. NOW BECAUSE OF THE MEN THAT WE TOOK. A WHEN THERE IS A PROBLEM TOO MUCH WEIGHT OR SOMETHING LOCAL THAT. THEY DON'T. WANT ALL ON ONE TOWER. YOU KNOW IT WOULD YIELD. THE COMMUNITY COMPANY WOULD BEAR THE EXPENSE OF PUTTING IN ANOTHER TOWER OR A SWAGING THE CONCERTS OF THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY. SO THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS A GREAT AND NORMALLYI'M A BIG PROPONENT OF LOCAL CONTROL. THERE ARE SOME SITUATIONS- THAT ARE IN THE ESSENTIAL SERVICE CATEGORY THAT I BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE- A- DEGREE OF SHARED CONTROL. SO THAT- PROPER INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE PUT INTO PLACE IN THOSE. THOSE INVESTMENTS BE MADE POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL GO TO CENTER GONZALEZ- BUT IF I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WE HAVE. HERTZBERG BECKER AND MEN WANTING TO SPEAK IF WE CAN JUST NOT GET IT NOT OFFENSE YES. YES OKAY WHO. COULD A CERTAIN SALAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK- THIS YEAR OF COURSE MANY OF US HAVE BEEN LEGISLATING ON BROADBAND ISSUES AND I KNOW THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO- THE SENATOR THE GOOD SENATOR FROM NAPA AND SO WANT TO THANK HIM FOR BRINGING THIS FOR TO KNOW IT'S NOT. EASY AND I ALSO- HAVE A FEW CITIES SIGNAL HILL MAY WOULD LAKE WOULD- THE WHO HAVE A DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BUT I KNOW THAT WILL CONTINUE WORKING I'M WITH THEM. ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO TO HELP I'D LOVE TO DO THAT AND I ONCE WANTED TO BE ON RECORD TO SAY THAT SO ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG FOLLOWED BY CENTER BECKER FOLLOWED BY CINNAMON. YES THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST VERY BRIEFLY YOU KNOW. THESE SMALL CELLS HAVE BECOME THE FOUNDATION THE BACKBONE OF THIS WHOLE EXPANSIVE ECONOMY IN WHICH WERE INVOLVED IN ALL OF US USE THESE DEVICES EVERY DAY WHEN I SERVED IN GOVERNMENT BEFORE THEY DIDN'T EXIST GOOGLE DIDN'T EXIST- I PHONES DIDN'T EXIST BUT IT'S CHANGING AT A FAST PACE WHILE I WAS OUT OF GOVERNMENT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING IN THIS SPACE ALL AROUND THE WORLD EVERY YEAR DURING MY BIRTHDAY I WOULD GO TO SOUTH AFRICA THE CAPE TOWN TO AFRICOM. DEALING WITH THE LARGEST. SO COMPANIES IN THE WORLD CHICORY WITH RESPECT TO AFRICA AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN RWANDA BUT YOU WOULDN'T LOSE CELL TRANSITION YOU'D YOU'D GO ANYWHERE AND YOU WOULDN'T LOSE TRANSMISSION YOU GO TO JAPAN YOU DON'T LOSE TRANSMISSION ARGUEDON THE FOUR OH FIVE IN MY COMMUNITY AND I LOSE TRANSMISSION AND THAT THE DEMAND IS GREATER AND GREATER- I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK WE'RE ANYWHERE NEAR WE NEED TO BE WITH FIVE G. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOW MUCH CONTROL THAT THEY WANT I GET IT. BUT THIS IS LIKE A NATIONAL RAILWAY SYSTEM A NATIONAL ROAD SYSTEM IS SO IMPORTANT WE IN THIS BODY TALK ALL THE TIME ABOUT ACCESS TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WELL THAT ACCESS IS NOT JUST INFORMED BY WHAT THE ROADS LOOK LIKE OR WHAT THE TRAP PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION LOOKS LIKE IT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENS OVER THESE DEVICES AND EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO EXPEDITE THIS PROCESS IN MY JUDGMENT PARTICULARLY FOR MY GLOBAL EXPERIENCE. IN SEEING ALL AROUND THE WORLD IN ASIA ALL TO CHINA AND THE LIKE HOW MUCH HEY'RE GETTING AHEAD OF US ON THESE THINGS THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL SPEED TO MARKET IS EVERYTHING STRONG SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. SIR BAKER. THANK YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR IT DOES THIS. IT ANYWAY MAKE IT MORE RESTRICTIVE POLICIES IN WITH THE FCC ALREADY. SAYS IS PERMISSIBLE. MY ANSWER TO THAT IS NO BUT I THINK IT'S WE OUGHT TO ASK MISTER RAMOS- AND HAVE HIM GO ON RECORD THAT QUESTION FOR CENTER BECKER MISTER RACES ONE ANSWER THAT QUESTION I'M SORRY CHAIR COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION SENATORS. QUESTION MISTER BECKER WHETHER SHORT IS A BILL REQUIRING THINGS ABOVE AND BEYOND WITH THE FCC ALREADY REQUIRES TO MAKE IT MORE RESTRICTIVE ESSENTIALLY WHAT CITIES CAN DO OR IS IT PRIMARILY CODIFYING WITH FCC ALREADY. REQUIRES THANK YOU SENATOR THE ANSWER IS NO THE BILL FILLS IN SOME OF THE DETAILS THAT THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION WISELY DEFERRED TO THE STATE SUCH AS HOW STATES WOULD COME UP WITH. A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF COSTS BUT THE BILL IS A 100% CONSISTENT. WITH THE FCC ORDER. OKAY I THAT AND WE SHOULD BE ALL DRESS THE MEMO INTO LAW OF WORK IS BEING DONE TO SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN THE TRANSPORTATION RIGHT. TRANSMISSION RIGHT AWAY ON A CORNER I'M WATCHING WITH GREAT INTEREST AND I'VE HEARD THE SAFETY CONCERNS FOR THE DISTRICTS SO CONTINUE WATCHES GOING FORWARD BUT I WILL. NOT BE SUPPORTED TODAY. OKAY CENTER MEANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES TO NAPA FOR BRINGING FORTH THIS BILL WE'RE RIGHT NOW IN THE NATIONAL DEBATE OVER WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS THE PRESENCE BROUGHT FORTH A TWO TRILLION DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY INFRASTRUCTURE'S INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS SO CRITICAL FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IS GOING% TO DETERMINE OUR COMPETITIVENESS AS AN ECONOMY. AND WE'VE SEEN THIS STARKLY ILLUSTRATED DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS TO THE INTERNET ACCESS TO FIVE G. FOUR G. IS IT SO IMPORTANT FOR OUR KIDS SCHOOLING FOR BUSINESS FOR SO MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE AND I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE MAJORITY LEADER WE ARE FALLING BEHIND IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS HI AND IF WE'RE GONNA TRY TO CATCH UP WITH WE'RE GOING TO REMAIN THE LEADER ECONOMICALLY IN THE WORLD. WE NEED TO INVEST IN THESE TYPES OF THINGS AND THE SENATOR FROM NAPA'S BILL DOES THIS EXTREMELY LOW COST IS NOT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS IS COST NEUTRAL ODYSSEY REASONABLE STEPS AND LOOK I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS AROUND LOCAL CONTROL CONCERNS AROUND THE SAFETY THESE DEVICES I HAD A LONG CHAT WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA EARLIER TODAY AND HE WALKED ME THROUGH. MANY OF THESE CONCERNS I KNOW HE'S BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN WILL CONTINUE WORKING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS BUT I WANT TO JUST REITERATE THAT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT FOR OUR STATE AS WE. MOVE FORWARD. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SPORT THE BILL THANK YOU TO DO WE HAVE ANY ELSE. OKAY OF. I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S COMMENTS I THINK THIS THE COMMENT RELATING TO- PUSHING FOR WITH NEW INNOVATION THE IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS VERY IMPORTANT NINE HI AS MENTIONED BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I DID RUN A BILL THAT WAS VETOED THAT ENVISIONED TO GETTING OUT AHEAD. OF OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS I THINK REALLY CALIFORNIA SHOULD TAKE A LEAD. AND THIS IS INFRASTRUCTURE WE DESPERATELY NEED TO LIVE. YEAH AND YOU KNOW OF FEDERAL LAW ALREADY STUN OF DONE TO THIS BILL CLEAN SET UP AN OPPORTUNITY STATUE NOT ALSO. CREATES THE PROCESSES BY WHICH COULD THIS COULD BE. DONE EFFICIENTLY BUT ALSO SAFELY AND YOU CAN'T IGNORE. ALL THE NUMBER OF LAWS THAT WE HAVE PASSED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVING TO DO WITH FIRES SAFETY AND PRODUCT SAFETY AND HARDENING ARE CREATED MAKING IT MORE RESILIENT TO FIRES AND I THINK THIS WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO THAT REVIEW PROCESS OF MAKING SURE THAT ANYTHING THAT IS CONSTRUCTIVE. CONFORMS WITH WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS. SO- CENTER DOT IF YOU WANNA MAKE SOME CLOSING COMMENTS WE COULD MOVE FORWARD WITH YES I SHOULD SHARE I WANT TO THANK MY FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS- YOU KNOW HERE FOR THEIR CONFIDENCE IN- THE POLICY ITSELF BUT ALSO IN ME TO DO THE WORK THAT'S LEFT OVER THIS NECESSARY TO WORK WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND OTHERS ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS YOU'VE GOT MY WORD THAT I'LL DO THAT GOING FORWARD I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EITHER.

PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. YEAH. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE BUILDINGS SECTOR IS THE SECOND LARGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STATE MAKING ALMOST A QUARTER OF OUR OVERALL EMISSIONS BECAUSE OF THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY FORTY FIVE BUILDING STARK WILL BE BUILT BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE REDUCE EMISSIONS IN OUR BILLION SECTORS KEY TO REACHING THE STATE'S EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS. MANY LOCAL AGENCIES OF DRILL PROGRAMS AND PASS REACH CLOSER REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS IN THE BUILDING STOCK. BUT THERE'S BEEN MINIMAL ACTION FROM THE STATE. TO MAKE SIMILAR EFFORTS FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS. RIGIDLY STRUCTURED TO EMPHASIZE COST SAVINGS. AND HAVE ONLY RECEIVED BANDAID FIXES A RECENT YEARS TO ALONG WITH THEIR MOST URGENT DEMAND SUCH AS THE CLIMATE CRISIS. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE TAKE SWIFT ACTION TO REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS IN THE BUILDING SECTOR BY INSTITUTING A LARGE SCALE REVISION. OF OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THE B<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> ADOPTION OF CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS IN OUR BUILDING START. WITH THE RECENT FEDERAL MINISTRATIONS CHANGE. WE CAN LIKELY EXPECT AN INFLUX OF FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS WHICH CAN BE WHICH CAN HELP. BOOST FUNDING. OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUILDING DECARBONIZATION PROJECTS. THEREFORE THE IDEA HERE IS TO CODIFY BUILDING DECARBONIZATION INTO EXISTING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS AGAIN EXISTING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS TO PROMOTED AS ANOTHER TOOL UTILITIES REGULATORS CAN USE TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT PRESERVE PUBLIC HEALTH. SB THIRTY ONE A CAUCUSES IS BUYING CORPORATE BUILDING CARBONIZATION INTO ALREADY EXISTING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT IS ESTABLISHED AS A STATE WIDE PRIORITY MOVING FORWARD. AND ALLOWS FOR ANY FUNDING TO PULL EASILY TO BUILDING DECARBONIZATION PROGRAMS OR PROJECTS. I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE BILL IN NO WAY PRAYER FOR TICE'S BUILDING DECARBONIZATION FOR EXAMPLE OVER OTHER METHODS OF CARBON REDUCTION WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS. AND IT DOES NOT ALTER THEIR FUNDING STRUCTURES I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR. THAT BY TAKING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS OF WHICH I DO. ARE WE PROVIDE AN INCLUSIVE DEFINITION FOR BUILDING DECARBONIZATION THAT APPLIES TO ALL MENTIONS OF THE TERM IN THE BILL SO THAT IT DOES NOT PRESCRIBE ONE SINGULAR PATHWAY FOR APPROACH FOR HER WE REMOVE CARBON FROM OUR BUILDINGS. I WANT TO THANK THE CHERRY COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK OF WORKING WITH ME AND MY STAFF THE TO IMPROVE THIS BILL FOR TODAY'S HEARING. AID HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MELISSA ROMERO FROM THE CALIFORNIA. NEW CONSERVATION VOTERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THE COURT TIME A- FORMAT.

TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATOR CLINTON AT THREE THIRTY ONE AND I WANT TO FIRST START OFF BY SAYING THANK YOU TO THE CORRECT TECHNICAL RECOGNIZING THE IMMENSE OPPORTUNITY THAT EXISTS. WITH FEDERAL FUNDING COMING TO CALIFORNIA TO GO TOWARDS EXISTING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE PRIVATIZATION OF THE BILL THE FACTOR WHICH WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT RATEPAYERS FINANCIALLY AND HAVE GREAT PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. BUT CAN ALSO ALIGN YOU CONCRETING PROGRAMS THAT THE PEOPLE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. BOB THE CREDIT CRISIS. FUNDING FOR THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS THAT WILL GO TO BE CARBONATED BUILDING FACTOR. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT THE REDUCTION IN ENERGY USE LOWER ENERGY BILLS AFTER THE CLEAN ENERGY AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. AND THE SENATOR STATED CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS BUT THE BUILDINGS THAT LIVE AND WORK AND CONTINUE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A QUARTER EDUCATION GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. MEANING THAT CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO MEET GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAVE FAT AND REDUCE EMISSIONS AT A LEVEL THAT WOULD BE THE- OF THE KIND OF CRAZY AS- THE LAST PLANNED FOR THE PRIVATIZATION. OF BUILDING. AND IF YOU FEEL INCLINED. THE STATE NOT ONLY IN. TO HELP AND ENVIRONMENT IMPACT AT THE END OF IN THE BUILDING SECTOR. WELCOME TO THE B. ACTS. WORK FOR INCREASE ENERGY UP. CAPITAL OF THE BUILDING CARBONIZATION CAN BE. I BY POWER. I THINK 31% A MAJOR ALL. CONDITIONALLY RELY FEDERAL. FOR AN EXTRA THE REDUCTION OF THE GAS. FROM THE BUILDING FACT.

YES MISTER CHAIRMAN A MEMBER SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL SHEET METAL WORKERS AND THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU ARE ON DECARBONISATION THIS BILL IT'S COMPLETELY PERVERSE. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS WERE DEVELOPED TO DECREASE RELIANCE ON THE ELECTRICAL GRID INTO LOWER RATE PAYERS RATES. D. D. IS ANY INCREASES COSTS FOR RATEPAYERS NUMBER TWO.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE CORTES WE WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR. BOB BECKER WITH SB SIX EIGHT. AND YOU COULD PRESENT FROM YOUR DESK CENTER BACK IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU ABSOLUTELY GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. SB SIXTY EIGHT IS ABOUT REDUCING BARRIERS. FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO. HELP US KEEP OUR COMMON GOALS IN BUILDINGS AND VEHICLES. UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE WANT TO SWITCH TO ELECTRIC HEATING FOR INSTALL VEHICLE CHARGERS OR ENERGY STORAGE EQUIPMENT. THEY OFTEN FACE HIGH COSTS AND LONG DELAYS. WE NEED PEOPLE TO BE MAKING THESE CHANGES TO MEET OUR GOALS SO WE SHOULD MAKE IT A LOT EASIER FOR THEM TO DO SO. THE BILL TAXPAYERS IN THREE WAYS. BETTER INFORMATION. BETTER TECHNOLOGY. REDUCING DELAYS. FIRST INFORMATION CONTRACTORS OFTEN HAVE LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH ELECTRIC HEATING AND OTHER NEW DEVICES AND GIVEN ADEQUATE THE ADVICE ABOUT THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO HOMEOWNERS. WILL END UP BEING TALKED ABOUT FOR CATION BUT TO FIND BECAUSE CONTRACTORS DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT. WITHIN OF DOING COSTLY PANEL UPGRADES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. LOCAL BUILDING DEPARTMENTS ARE ALSO UNFAMILIAR WITH BUILDING EXTRICATION. AT THE TIME AND COST REQUIRED TO GET PERMITS INSPECTIONS IS MAKING IT UNNECESSARILY EXPENSIVE. THIS BILL DIRECTS ENERGY COMMISSION TOGETHER AND PUBLISH BEST PRACTICES TO HELP GET BETTER INFORMATION OUT THERE TO HELP BUILDING OWNERS THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO THIS MORE EFFICIENTLY. SECOND TECHNOLOGY. WE DRIVE DOWN COSTS THERE'S SOME TECHNOLOGY THEY CAN AVOID THE NEED FOR PANEL UPGRADES WILL MAKE IT FASTER AND CHEAPER TO HANDLE PANEL CHANGES. BUT IT'S RELATIVELY NEW AND NOT WIDELY DEPLOYED. THIS IS AN AREA WHERE ARE ANTI FUNDING COULD HELP. THE BILL SAYS THAT REDUCING THE COST OF BILL MUCH VACATION SHOULD BE ON THE LIST OF CHALLENGES TARGETED BY THE EPIC PROGRAM. THE THIRD DELAYS PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO ADD ELECTRIC HEATING OR ENERGY STORAGE ARE OFTEN FRUSTRATED BY SLOW SERVICE FROM UTILITIES. IN GETTING ELECTRICAL SERVICE CAPACITY INCREASED WE'RE GETTING PERMISSION TO TURN ON THEIR STORAGE SYSTEM. MANY COMPLAINTS THAT WE'VE DOCUMENTED FROM FOLKS MY OWN DISTRICT ABOUT HOW LONGER PROJECTS WERE DELAYED. ONE PERSON TRYING TO SELL HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER WAS DELAYED FOR FIVE MONTHS WE'VE UTILITY RESPONSE REQUEST TO UPGRADE THE ELECTRICAL PANEL. PANEL TO TWO HUNDRED AMPS. WITH A WATER HEATER NEEDS REPLACING BOTH PEOPLE ARE NOT HER PLACE TO ELECTRIC MODEL IF THEY NEED TO WAIT FIVE MONTHS. ANOTHER PERSON SHOULD FRUSTRATING STORY BUT THE SEVEN MONTHS IT TOOK TO GET PERMISSION TO TURN ON THE BETTER BATTERY STORAGE SYSTEM. BLACKOUTS HAPPENED LAST AUGUST THEY COULD USE IT BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL WAITING ON THE UTILITY. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE ACTORS WE HEAR FROM FRUSTRATED CONSTITUENTS. BUT WHATEVER WITNESSES WILL SPEAK TODAY THAT THEY HAVE ON WIDESPREAD NATURE OF THESE DELAYS. ESPECIALLY FOR ELECTRICAL PANEL UPGRADES. THIS BILL DIRECTLY TO THE COMMISSION TO SET RESPONSE TIME STANDARDS. AND HOLD UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO MEETING THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRING THEM TO REPORT RESULTS AND JUSTIFY ANY MISSTEP LINES. WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY TO HEAR BASIC LEVEL SIX SERVICE LEVEL STANDARDS YOU EXPECT MANY WHEN YOU DO BUSINESS WITH. I THANK THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE STAFFER IDENTIFIED SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BILL. PARTICULARLY IN ADDRESSING CONCERNS RAISED BY UTILITIES ABOUT THE WAY WE HAD TO FIND ROUTINE VERSUS NON ROUTINE SERVICE UPGRADES. AND HAPPY EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. TWO WITNESSES STANDING BY ON THE PHONE.

THANK YOU ANY OTHER SPEAKERS. THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL COME BACK TO THE FLOOR TO FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS MOTIONS SENATOR. BRADFORD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE BUT- HI TO HAVE GREAT CONCERNS NOT AT THE GOALS AND AMBITIONS OF THIS BILL BUT THE MISUNDERSTANDING AND MIS CHARACTERIZATION THAT. THIS IS ROUTINE WORK AS INDIVIDUAL WHO WORKED A SPENT TWELVE YEARS WORKING FOR A UTILITY I WAS THE INTERFACE MANY TIMES OF THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS MANAGER WITH COMMUNITIES WHO WANT ONE OF THESE FACILITIES INTO MANY MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WERE OPPOSED TO IT A POST NOT BECAUSE OF. WHAT WAS INVOLVED WHAT WE REALLY BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS OFTEN INVOLVE NOT WITH THEIR NEIGHBOR WAS ASKING FOR. FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WASN'T ABOUT ELECTRIC CARS IN THEIR DRIVEWAY WAS ABOUT PEOPLE. BELT ENLARGING THEIR HOMES THE MAXIMIZATION OF HOMES GOING FROM A TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOME TO A THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOME REQUIRING PANELS TO BE CHANGED BUT- IT'S MORE THAN JUST GOING TO A HOUSE IN CHANGING THE PANEL. WHAT AM MEMBERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE POLL HAS TO BE CHANGED AS WELL AND THAT'S WHERE THE WRIST THE TIME IN THE ENGINEERING COMES IN. IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ELECTRICITY IN OUR COMMUNITY SMALL CIRCLES ROUND CYLINDER TRANSFORMERS ARE FOUR KV. THEY WERE PUT THERE FIFTY SIXTY YEARS AGO NOW WE FAST FORWARD TO ALL THE HOMES WHO HAVE MULTIPLE COMPUTERS AND TV'S IN THEIR HOME LOAD USAGE IS GROWING TO REQUIRES YOU TO CHANGE OUT. THAT FOUR KV TAUGHT EIGHT OR SIXTEEN KV TRANSFORMER THAT'S FOR THE DELAY COMES IN SO IN ORDER TO TRANSFER. A CHANGE THAT OUT REQUIRES IN THE BRING DOWN POWER. FIRST YOU HAVE TO ENGINEERS. AND MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO IMPROVE THE DISTRIBUTION LINE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING FROM FOUR KV TO NOW EIGHTY K. B. OR SIXTEEN KV SO YOU HAVE TO REWIRE THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD MIGHT MANY TIMES OR AT LEAST A STREET WHERE THIS WORK IS GOING ON. AND THEN YOU SAY THE REPAIRS TO PAY FOR BUT THAT WAS PART OF THE ARGUMENTS WE SEVEN HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS WHEN WE MET WITH THE RESIDENTS OF SEEN. JUST BECAUSE MY NEIGHBOR WANTED THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOME WHY SHOULD I BE DOING FOR PAYING FOR. THIS UPGRADE OF INFRASTRUCTURE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF MY NEIGHBOR AND I FIND A REAL IRONIC ALL THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CONTINUE. THE SAY THEIR ENERGY INDEPENDENT. AND NO LONGER NEED. THE UTILITY. BY DOING THIS YOU FALL MORE MORE DEPENDENT ON THE UTILITY TO MAKE SURE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THERE SO THERE IS A CONCERT IT'S NOT A INDEPENDENT SAID MANY PEOPLE ARGUE. YOU NEED TO UTILITY BUT YOU JUST CAN'T ROLE IN A CRUEL OVERNIGHT. AND CHANGE OUT OF. THE PANEL ON A HOME WHEN I FIRST WHEN INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE POLE AND THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND THAT'S WHERE THE DELAYS COMING AND- IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE SITTING AROUND. TWIDDLING THEIR THUMBS I'VE WATCHED THESE LIKE TRADITIONS I WATCHED THESE LINEMEN GO OUT AND DO THE WORK. AND I HI AND IT'S TEDIOUS WORK. AND YOU HAVE TO ENGINEER YOU HAVE A PLANNING DEPARTMENT DO HAS TO. SCHOOL ALL THIS WORK OUT IS NOT TO SIMPLY LOOK THE SAME GOING TO A HOME IN CHANGING OUT OF COUNCIL. I NEED FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND- AGAIN I COMMEND THE GOALS OF THIS BILL BUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE SO DESCRIBE THIS AS ROUTINE. AS FAR FROM ROUTINE WORK. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS BILL. WE HAVE A MUCH BY CENTER GONZALEZ. VERY WELL- IF THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS I JUST WANT ONE OF. CLARIFY THE MOTION IS- TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY- CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CAN I GO TO. MAKE YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS I'M SORRY CENTER PICTURE. I LIKE TO CLOSE AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS AND- I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE WORKING WITH US TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER TO ONE ADDRESS BY MY GOOD FRIEND- THIS COMMENTS- IN THE CLOTHES WHICH IS TO SAY A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS THAT. PART OF THIS BILL IS EDUCATION BECAUSE MANY TIMES THE PANELS ACTUALLY DON'T NEED TO BE UPGRADED. AND I'M FACING THAT RIGHT NOW WE SAID ELECTRIC CAR QUESTIONS DO WE NEED TO UPGRADE THE PANEL SO THIS IS REALLY A BETTER EDUCATION. AS MANY TIMES. THIS IS A LOT MORE YOU CAN DO ON ON THE EXISTING PANELS THAN PEOPLE THINK. CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT CREATING A NEWPROCESS IS READY PROCESS THAT EXISTS- FOR RULES AROUND PERMISSION TO OPERATE. IN THAT WORKS WELL. WE DON'T PUT DEADLINES HAD A SAFETY. MOST CASES SHOULD BE ABLE TO FINISHED WITHIN THE TIMELINES ESTABLISHED BUT IF NOT THE TO THE NEED TO REPORT THE DELAY TO THE QC. EXPLAINED WHY AND GIVEN ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETION. THAT'S REALLY THE SAME PROCESS THAT HAPPENS TODAY AROUND PERMISSION TO OPERATE. IN MOST CASES WILL BE RELATIVELY SIMPLE CASES. AS MY COLLEAGUE SAYS SOME WILL BE MORE COMPLICATED. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE WILL TAKE LONGER. WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE. TO MANAGE FOR THAT. SO WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID. I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS. AND EFFECTIVELY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB SIXTY EIGHT BY SENATOR RECORD TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST DEMANDS AND WE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. WESSEL WESSELS BY DOLLY NO. TELLING THEM BAKER HI BAKER I. REGIS BRADFORD. DODD DODD AYE EGGMAN HI. EGGMAN HI GONZALEZ I GONZALEZ I. NO GROVE KNOWN HERTZBERG HI HERTZBERG AYE MCGUIRE. MEN BY WOMEN I RUBIO. STERN STERN I. SURE THERE'S AS INTERNALS OKAY THAT BILL HAS ENOUGH TO GET OUT WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BILL CENTER DAUGHTER YOU READY TO PRESENT SB NINETY NINE. FIFTY COMPOSITE FROM YOUR DESK FEEL LIKE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB NINETY NINE THE COMMUNITY ENERGY RESILIENCE ACT SB NINETY NINE CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF A NEW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE RESOURCES TO DEVELOP CLEAN ENERGY RESILIENCE PLANS WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH UTILITIES AND PRIORITIZING ENHANCE RESILIENCE FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE FREQUENCY OF NATURAL DISASTERS IN THE UTILITIES USE A PROACTIVE POWER SHUT OFFS. LOWS IN ENORMOUS COST ON CALIFORNIA IT PROMPTED MANY HOMEOWNERS BUSINESSES AND UTILITIES TO RUSH TO PURCHASE HIGHLY POLLUTING BACKUP GENERATORS. THERE IS BETTER ALL IN ABOUT A BETTER ALTERNATIVE THEN HE INSISTS THAT ENHANCES ENERGY RESILIENCE USING DECENTRALIZED LOCALLYPRODUCED CLEAN ENERGY THAT ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF-RECENT COST REDUCTIONS FOR CLEAN ENERGY. UNLIKE DIESEL GENERATORS THAT MIGHT ONLY BE USED A FEW DAYS A YEAR DISTRIBUTED CLEAN ENERGY CAN BE USED ON A DAILY BASIS INCLUDING TO LOAD SHIPS ACCESSIBLE GENERATION FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY SO CONSERVE. IN THE EVENING HE CLOSED OUR STATE'S ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM UTILITIES HAVE BEEN WORKING TO ENHANCE RESILIENCE THROUGH OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT THEY DO NOT CONTROL THE LOCAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE ROADS AND PARKING LOTS OF MUNICIPAL. FACILITIES PLACES WORD DISTRICT NEW DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES COULD BE STRATEGICALLY LOCATED. BECAUSE THE ENERGY RESILIENCE IS INHERENTLY LOCAL BUILDING MORE RESILIENT SYSTEM WILL REQUIRE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES THE PLAN IN SIGHT DISTRIBUTED DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. THIS IS WHERE SB NINETY NINE FEELS THE CURRENT VOID IN STATE POLICY IT PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH RESOURCES TO DETERMINE HOW AND WHERE TO SITE NEW ENERGY RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE IN COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTION UTILITY. RATHER THAN HAVE A CRUCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT DECISIONS MAYBE A PROCESS DISCONNECTED FROM LOCAL PRIORITIES AND NEEDS IT WOULD FOSTER COLLABORATION AND STRATEGIC PLANNING. THIS TYPE OF PLANNING IS NECESSARY IT'S A NECESSARY FIRST STEP IN ATTRACTING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN ENERGY pPARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS FEDERAL LAWMAKERS CONTEMPLATE A NEW TRILLION DOLLAR. INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE I'M JOINED HERE TODAY BY TWO WITNESSES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY NINE. KURT JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY WAS EMERGING RESILIENCE AT THE CLIMATE CENTER AND MICHAEL WARREN DIRECTOR OF ENERGY AND CLIMATE POLICY PROGRAM. AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. OKAY WE HAVE TO US IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES ALLOTTED FOR THE SPEAKERS SO EACH SPEAKER HAVE A MINUTE AND A HALF. WILL BEGIN BUT WITH KIRK JOHNSON.

TODAY NOT NOT TODAY JUST A THREE MINUTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRED VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ADAM SMITH SEVEN CALIFORNIA EDISON IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE THREE THREE WE BELIEVE THAT ONGOING SYSTEM HARDENING AND ONGOING HE UC REGULATORY OVERSIGHT NICK THE PROPOSALS IN THE BILL UNNECESSARY TO PAINT A PICTURE OF KIND OF WHERE WE'VE COME FROM AND WHERE WE'RE GOING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE. GET THEM BACK. WERE DE ENERGIZED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. OR NOT HE ENERGIZED. IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S ALMOST A 50% DROP IN CIRCUIT DE ENERGIZED. DUE TO IN PART ARE REQUEST HARDENING ACTIVITIES. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PC SB HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE CIRCUITS THAT WERE MOST IMPACTED WAX IN TWENTY TWENTY AND ON THE FIFTEENTH OF THIS MONTH WE FINALIZED PLANS TO HARD IN THOSE SEARCH. OUR OUR ESTIMATES ARE BY THE HEIGHT OF THE SANTA ANA WINDS EVEN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE BELIEVE THAT HYPER FOCUSED ON THE MOST PFAS IMPACTED CIRCUITS. WILL REDUCE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS IMPACTED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY ANOTHER 50% THAT'S THE KIND OF YOU KNOW I DID MENTION EARLIER THAT THE KIND OF YEAR ON YOUR PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING ON THE AT. ISSUE WE UNDERSTAND THE AUTHORS EXPECTED AMENDMENTS WE LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THOSE BUT IN PRINCIPLE WE THINK THAT THE KIND OF SPECIFIC. TECHNOLOGIES AND APPROACHES CALLED OUT IN THIS BIL THINGS LIKE MICROGRID UNDERGROUNDING WILL BECOME. UNNECESSARY AND COST PROHIBITIVE. EXCEPT IN THE MOST EXTREME CASES. IMPARTING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IS THE RIGHT AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF PSP- WITHOUT STRANDING AFTER. I THINK IT'S BEEN ONE QUICK MOMENT BEFORE I CLOSE JUST HIGHLIGHTING ANOTHER ISSUE OF THE BILL THAT WASN'T ADDRESSED. IN RECENT AMENDMENTS WE UNDERSTAND THE AUTHORS TAKING SB FIFTY FIVE THIRTY THREE ALSO AGREED TO POTENTIAL SECURITY RISKS ARE REQUIRING A CENTRALIZED DATABASE SPECIFYING ALL THE GOVERNMENTAL FACILITIES AND HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICT ALONG WITH IDENTIFYING THE WIRES AND TRANSFORMERS IN CONNECTION TO PROVIDE POWER TO THE BUILDING THE FACILITIES THINGS LIKE WATER PUMP FIRE STATIONS HSPITALS. DUE TO CYBER SECURITY RISK EDIT AND BELIEVE THE DATABASE LIKE THIS IS VERY CONCERNING A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITY DATABASE COULD PROVIDE A ROADMAP TO DISRUPT ELECTRIC DELIVERY TO THIS CRITICAL FACILITY IF IT GETS INTO THE WRONG HANDS. WE AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH SUGGESTED THAT THE RISKS MAY OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A DATABASE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE ALREADY WORK SO CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS TO PLAN. YES MA'AM IN CLOSING SB YEAH SB FIVE THIRTY THREE RAISES CONCERNS OVER CUSTOMER KERR SECRETARY STRANDED INVESTMENTS WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH SENATOR STERN IN HIS OFFICE WE APPRECIATE THE FOCUS HIS PROXIMITY ISSUES IN HIS DRIVE.

THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL EXPAND THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY FOR LOW INCOME ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THE ELECTRICITY SAVINGS ASSISTANT PROGRAM IS ONE OF THE STATE'S LONGEST STANDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES NO COST HOME WEATHERIZATION SERVICES ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES AND MINOR HOME REPAIRS LOW INCOME FAMILIES SERVED BY THE STATE'S FOUR LARGEST ENERGY UTILITIES. THE PROGRAM HELPS TO CONSERVE ENERGY. REDUCE ENERGY UTILITY BILLS IMPROVE HEALTH COMFORT AND SAFETY SUPPORT JOBS AND DISADVANTAGED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ALL THE WHILE HELPING TO ADVANCE THE STATE CLIMATE GOALS. THE CURRENT INCOME ELIGIBILITY LIMIT HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND ELIGIBILITY TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WHOSE INCOME FALLS JUST ABOVE THE CURRENT LIMIT. OF TWO HUNDRED PERCENT. OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO THOSE HOUSEHOLDS AT OR BELOW LEVEL I ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IN NO WAY BUSINESS BUILDING INCREASING THE CURRENT BUDGETS. FOR THE ESSAY AND I DO NOT INTEND FOR THIS BILL TO INCREASE THE COSTS ON REPAIRS ON THE CONTRARY THERE OFTEN TENS AND SOMETIMES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AGO UNSPENT IN THE ESA BUDGETS ANNUALLY. THIS BILL BY EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF A LOW INCOME ELIGIBILITY WOULD HELP TO ENSURE THAT MORE OF KEPT CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL STRUGGLING FAMILIES WILL BE SERVED THAT WILL BE- ADDING COST EFFICIENCY MEASURES. AND COST SAVINGS INTO THE PROGRAM AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY INTO THE PROGRAM. THE LIGHT OF THE CURRENT PANDEMIC THE URGENCY TO HELP MORE CALIFORNIANS IS EVEN MORE PRESSING THIS IS A JOB CREATION BILL IT'S ALSO AN ENERGY SAVINGS BILL. BANERJEE EFFICIENCY BILL IN A QUALITY OF LIFE BILL I HAVE TO WILL WITNESSES ON THE LINE THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY AND SO FORTH WE HAVE WITH A CIVIL RIGHTS ICON ICON DOLORES HUERTA.

THANK YOU THANK IS OUR LITTLE IN A MONTH THANK THE COMMITTEE ALSO PARTICULAR AT THIS BILL- WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HOME WEATHER STATION. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY GIVES A LOT OF EDUCATION. TO FAMILIES ABOUT HAVING TO ENERGY SAVING BUT WE ALL KNOW. THAT WE ARE OF ALL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING AND- I WANT TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN. TO DECREASE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT. THIS IS ONE GREAT WAY TO DO IT AND SO THAT THIS BILL IS GREAT THANK YOU ONLY NEEDED AS WELL AS SOME KIND OF RELIGIOUS SAID IT WILL INCREASE. AND THESE ENERGY SAVING EDUCATION TO SAW MANY MORE FAMILIES THE DEATH OF THE LEADER WE DO A LOT OF WORK A LITTLE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT PEOPLE REALLY WOULD LIKE.

MY CHARLIE ME CHAIR YES GOOD EVENING SHRON MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS MICHAEL THE SENATE AND THE PRESIDENCY- PUBLIKU THE NATION'S LARGEST HOLE AND OLDEST COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. WHOSE WORK IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CPUC INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS EVER SINCE OESA PROGRAMS SECTION. WE THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WAS SO FOR YOUR AUTHORSHIP OF SENATE BILL SEVEN FIFTY SIX HUNDRED CURRENT RULE THE FAMILY FORCE ELIGIBLE FOR ME SO PROGRAM SERVICES IF THEY EARN NO MORE THAN APPROXIMATELY FORTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. UNDER THE NEW INCOME CAP PROPOSED IN SB SEVEN FIFTY SIX I THINK WE HAVE FOR. THE EARN UP TO FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH A MODEST INCREASE OF SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH. SENATORS YOUR PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE CALIFORNIANS WHO LIVE IN YOUR DISTRICTS WILL ALLOW US TO AGREE THAT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR TO MAKE IT ON FORTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR LESS PER MONTH JUST CONSIDERING HOUSING COSTS ALONE. I BELIEVE YOU WILL AGREE THAT A FAMILY EARNING ROUGHLY A THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE THAN THAT PER MONTH IT'S NOT IN SUCH AN IMPROVED FINANCIAL POSITION THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN ELIGIBLE FOR IMPORTANT SERVICES. SENATE JUBILEE MADE POSSIBLE BY SB SEVEN FIFTY SIX WILL NOT RESULT IN ANY INCREASE WHAT SO EVER TO RATE PAYERS OR TO THE STATE BUDGET SB SEVEN FIFTY SIX SIMPLY EXPAND THE PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY TO FAMILIES IN YOUR DISTRICTS OR AMONG THOSE MOST ECONOMICALLY IMPACTED.

IN ROOM ONE TWELVE IN SEEING NONE THERE OKAY MEMBERS WILL BRING IT BACK OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. I HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR DODD. SEEK OUT- SORRY CENTER RUBIO. THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NFI MAY I THINK I HEARD ANA ATTILA COMMISSIONERS ARABICA MAKE A COMMENT I'M JUST CURIOUS OF FOR JUST MY PERSONAL EDUCATION. AS YOU ARE DOING THESE PROJECTS HOW OUR FAMILIES NOTIFIED- THAT THIS IS AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF JUST A FEW. CAN MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT REAL QUICKLY THANK YOU. GENERALLY THESE PROGRAMS GENERALLY ARE PROMOTED EITHER THROUGH- THE DEPARTMENT WEBPAGE. OR SOMETIMES THEY'RE INCLUDED IN MERRILEES MAILINGS BY THE UTILITIES. OF BUT THIS IS OFTEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE STATE GENERALLY STRUGGLES WITH PROGRAMS AND REALLY FUNDING ADEQUATE OUT REACH THAT'S USUALLY ONE OF THE CHALLENGE SO OFTEN TIMES ARE NONPROFIT PARTNERS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE ATTILA COOL AND- DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE FARMWORKERS UNION AND DIFFERENT NONPROFITS THAT WORK WITH LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT- REACH OUT AND TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO QUALIFY FOR THESE PROGRAMS ALSO THERE'S A LONG LIST OF- CONTRACTORS THAT PERFORM THIS WORK. AND THEY ALSO ON THEIR OWN DIME OFTENTIMES REACH OUT AND MARKET THESE PROGRAMS PUBLICLY SO THAT PEOPLE COULD BE MADE AWARE THAT THEY EXISTED SO THEY COULD CALL ON THAT SO THERE'S A DIFFERENT- ALL THESE DIFFERENT METHODS OF DELIVERY OF SERVICE THROUGH ADVERTISEMENT OF NONPROFITS. CONTRACTORS AND STATE PROGRAMS. AND SO FAR IT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE- BUT OFTEN TIMES- WERE SEEN THAT LASTS FAMILIES. THAT- QUALIFIER ARE R. ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY PARTICIPATING PROGRAM A ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT QUALIFY UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM I BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE ROLLING OUT ENERGY EFFICIENCY- AT A LEVEL THAT THAT EXPANSION TO WHERE THE MARKET IS ACT I MEAN. THAT YOU YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THERE BEEN OTHER CHANGES AND IN IN INCOME OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS THAT NEED AN ADJUSTMENT THIS WILL BE AN ADJUSTMENT THAT SAW WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO- THE GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY AND- THE GROWTH AND CHANGES IN TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE EARN. THANK YOU AND I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM I KNOW THAT YOU PROBABLY IT'S SIMILAR TO SOMETHING ABOUT IN THE PAST THAT I ALSO SUPPORT BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO. HAVE COLLECTIVELY FOCUS ON HOW DO WE EXPANDED AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE OF FOLKS THAT QUALIFY HAVE ACCESS TO THAT BUT WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE ACTOR FOR CATION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER SENATORS WISH TO COMMENT. SAYING ON I WOULD A MINUTE. COMMENT I THINK THIS IS THE- APPROPRIATE BILL THERE THERE'S SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT FUND- I FOUND OUT TO FROM OUR CONSULTANT OR PROXY SIX HUNDRED MILLION. BY RAISING THE- CAP UP IT WILL BRING A LOT OF IN IT AND A LOW INCOME FAMILY- THAT TRYING TO SURVIVE IN CALIFORNIA FROM FIFTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS IS A REAL FEAT. THE COOL THING ABOUT THIS. THIS PROGRAM IS THAT IT ALLOWS YOU TO ENERGY EFFICIENT YOUR HOME AT THE SAME TIME. SAVING ENERGY SO YOU SEE YOU IT'S A DOUBLE WIN FOR THOSE FAMILIES SO FOR THOSE REASONS ALL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL SO.
