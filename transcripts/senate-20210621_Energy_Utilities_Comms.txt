VERY WELL THANK YOU THAT BILL WILL BE- THAT BILL HAS ENOUGH TO GET OUT BUT WILL HOLD HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH THE FIRST BILL A. B. FIVE THREE SEVEN BY TO COMMUNICATIONS WORLD WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND BROADBAND. FACILITIES WELCOME SOME REMEMBER QUIRK. YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. YES THANK YOU START SHARING SENATORS. NINE THANK YOU CHAIR FOR DISCUSSING THE BILL WITH ME EARLIER TODAY- SO THE BILL ITSELF IS A CLARIFICATION OF THE BILL THAT IS OF THE RULES THAT ARE IN. OUR STATUTE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN TIME LINE AND THE COUNTIES HAVE TO APPROVE IT OR DISAPPROVE OF IT WITHIN THAT TIME LINE- THEN IF THEY HAVEN'T ACTED IT'S DEEMED APPROVED AND THE PERMITS MUST BE ISSUED. AGAIN THEY CAN- BOTH AGREED AND ISSUED THE PERMITS OR THEY CAN DISAPPROVE OF NOTHING STOPS THEM FROM DOING THAT. SO WE HAVE A PROCESS WE'RE TRYING TO DEFINE IT. THE TIME LINES THAT WERE SET UP IN THE ORIGINAL BILL OF THAT SUPERSEDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE ALSO LINING THOSE. I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WORKED WITH US ON THIS PANEL. AND WHILE THEY OPPOSE THE ORIGINAL BILL INCLUDING AND ALSO A BILL THAT YOU AND I RAN. OUT TOO CLOSE TO ALSO WORK IN THIS AREA- THE- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE DROPPED THEIR OPPOSITION. THAT WAS DIFFICULT WE HAVE TO GET THEM TO AGREE TO EVERY COMMA EVERY PERIOD EVERY WORD. AND I WAS THEREFORE SURPRISED WHEN THE STAFF A COMMITTEE STAFF SAID THAT WE HAD PRECLUDED LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE JUDICIAL- REVIEW. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS FOR THIRTY DAYS FOR THEM TO APPLY FOR A JUDICIAL REVIEW THAT WAS NOT DEEMED O HAVE BEEN CHANGED. HOWEVER IN VIEW OF THE CONCERN OF THE COMMITTEE I'M QUITE WILLING TO GET TOGETHER OTHER BILL SPONSORS LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE STAFF AND GET AN AGREEMENT. IF THE CURRENT BILL DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE- IF THEY CAN CONVINCE US THAT THE CURRENT BILL PRECLUDES THAT. OR WE COULD CONVINCE THEM THAT THE CURRENT BILL DOESN'T BUT WE CAN GO FROM THERE IF WE ARE QUITE HAPPY IF WE CANNOT COMMIT. IF COMMITTEE STAFF. ARTIST BELIEVES THAT- DESPITE WHAT THE LAWYERS ARE SAYING THAT. WE HAVE PRECLUDED IT I AM QUITE HAPPY TO ADD CLARIFYING LANGUAGE. AND AGAIN THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT WITH BOTH SIDES BOTH THE SPONSOR THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND OF COURSE WE WOULD WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF. SO WITH THAT- I WOULD BE QUITE HAPPY TO BRING THE BILL FORWARD I PLEDGE THAT IF WE DON'T GET AGREEMENT FROM ALL SIDES THAT I WILL NOT. MOVE THE BILL OFF THE SENATE FLOOR ALL MAKE IT TO YOUR BILL. I ANTICIPATE WITH A FEW WEEKS WORK AND AGAIN I SAY A FEW WEEKS BECAUSE WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE GOT EVERY DOT. EVERY WORD OKAY SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT AGAIN AS WE- EXAMINE WHAT STAFFORD SAID. AND IF AGAIN IF THEY INSIST ON CLARIFYING LANGUAGE WERE QUITE HAPPY TO DO THAT IT'S JUST IT'LL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO DO IT. SO THAT'S WHAT I PROPOSE TO DO WITH THE BILL- IF YOU AGREE TO PASS IT OUT TODAY. WELL WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ANSWER THE CONCERNS OF COMMITTEE STAFF. THANK YOU TO SO I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE SPEAKERS OR CAN ORGANIZE PRESENTATION AND WE HAVE. AN ORGANIZED OPPOSITION TO AND- THERE ARE TWO IN EACH CATEGORY ON BOTH. AND I I'M- GONNA SET ASIDE THREE MINUTES TOTAL FOR EACH WHICH WOULD GIVE EACH SPEAKER- A NINETY NINETY SECONDS OR MEET THE MINUTE AND A HALF TO MAKE THEIR PRESENTATIONS- SO WE'RE GONNA ASK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH THE- THIS THE ORGANIZED PRESENTATION SUPPORT WE HAVE NICK. NATE SOUL OF FROM CUT CROWN CASTLE FOLLOWED BY FEDERAL NAVA- THESE FEATURE A COMMISSIONER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE LITTLE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION SO- MODERATOR CAN WE CHECK TO SEE IF- NASAL OF IS ON THE LINE. YEAH LATE SOW UP HERE ON BEHALF OF CROWN CASTLE THANK YOU ASSUMING THE RECORD SHARE WEBSITE WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR YEARS OF COMMITMENT JOKES ALREADY BROADBAND EXPANSION IN ACCESSING CALIFORNIA. WE SHARE YOUR GOAL AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW HIGH SPEED INTERNET PROJECTS TO BE COMPLETED IN MONTHS INSTEAD OF YEARS. CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS PERMIT SHOT CLOCKS IN PLACE FOR BROADBAND PROJECTS THANKS TO ITS ON THE RECORD HE B. FIFTY SEVEN FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN THIS LAW HAS BEEN WORKING WELL AND HAS HELPED PREVENT PERMIT DELAYS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THIS BILL SIMPLY UPDATE CALIFORNIA LAW TO REFLECT THE NEW FEDERAL TIMELINES THAT WERE RECENTLY ADOPTED SOLAR SHOT CLOCKS ARE CONSISTENT. AND ALSO PROVIDE CLARITY AROUND WHEN THE SHOT CLOCK STARRED IN THE PROCESS. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SHOT CLOCK. FIVE SEVEN THE RIGHT BALANCE THAT PRESERVES THE CAN. BY A SHOULD TO YOU WHATEVER PROCESS THEY WANT TO EVALUATE BROADBAND PREVENTS. AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO APPROVE OR DENY THE BROAD BAND- BUT- THAT ALSO HAS ENHANCED PROTECTIONS FOR PROJECTS IN THE RIGHT OF WAY. THIS IS WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT GROUPS LIKE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES C. SACK AND RC RC OR NEUTRAL. ALL THE BILL DOES IT MAKE SURE THAT CITIES MAKE A DECISION TO APPROVE OR DENY A BROADBAND PREVENT WITHIN FEDERALLY MANDATED TIMELINES WHICH ARE TYPICALLY TWO TO THREE MONTHS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PROJECT. THIS BILL WILL MAKE A REA DIFFERENCE FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO DESPERATELY NEED IMPROVED INTERNET ACCESS FOR SCHOOL TELEHEALTH REMOTE WORK IN COMMERCE. THAT WILL LEAD TO COMMUNITIES GETTING QUICKER ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET PROJECTS WHILE MAINTAINING LOCAL CONTROL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED DIALOGUE WITH THE COMMITTEE ON. CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU NOW CAN WE HEAR FROM FEDERAL NAVA.

YET IN OUR TWENTY TWENTY ISSUE BRIEF ON CALIFORNIA'S DIGITAL DIVIDE WE FOUND THAT AS MANY AS TWO POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LACK ACCESS TO BROADBAND AFFORDABLE HIGH SPEED INTERNET IS NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER YET FAR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE LEFT WITHOUT. A STATE WRAPS UP ITS DIGITAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO IT WILL BE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE RELIABLE BROADBAND CVERAGE EIGHTY FIVE THREE SEVEN WOULD ADVANCE THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION BY INCREASED ACCESS TO RELIABLE HIGH SPEED BROADBAND THE BILL WOULD MAKE SURE THAT ALL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. UTILIZE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S BROADBAND PERMIT SHOT CLOCKS SO HIGH SPEED INTERNET PROJECTS CAN BE DELIVERED QUICKLY TO OUR COMMUNITIES EIGHTY FIVE THREE SEVEN STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE BY ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO APPROVE OR DENY BROADBAND PERMITS THE BILL JUST CLARIFIED THAT IT MUST BE DONE IN A REASONABLE TIME FRAMES THE STYLISH BY THE FCC ON BEHALF OF A LITTLE OVER COMMISSION.

AND MEDICARE THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THE TIME. VERY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMITTEE MEMBER COMMENTS. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL- REGARDING A SHOOTING PERMITS AND ALLOWING CONSTRUCTION- AND I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN INCIDENTS- IN IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE- REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MORE LAX WHERE YOU'VE ACTUALLY HAD CONTRACTORS- PERFORM WORK WITHOUT. CONTRACTOR'S LICENSE OR EVEN PERMITS. AND SO WE I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. THAT IT IT DOESN'T EVADE THE PUBLIC SAFETY PERMITTING PROCESS AND THAT IT DOESN'T SEND MESSAGES TO THE PUBLIC THAT THEY DID HAVE NO LEGAL RECOURSE TO CHALLENGE- THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE PROJECTS AS THEY COME AND I MAY NOT. I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND I AND I. ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW AS LONG AS WE HAVE COMPETITION OF BROADBAND IN CALIFORNIA THERE THEY'LL BE A HEALTHY MECHANISM THAT'LL HELP TO ENSURE THAT WE KEEP THE COSTS LOWER FOR THE USERS. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY THAT- CUTS THROUGH A LOG JAM OF THE LANE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A OF A SYSTEM THAT HELPS WITH A RESPONSE TO WILDFIRES A RESPONSE TO PUBLIC SAFETY- ARRIVING FASTER WHEREVER IT IS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TO PROTECT PUBLIC. AND THAT COMMUNICATIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE IMPROVEMENT OUR ECONOMY AND GIVING PEOPLE ACCESS TO IT. AND WE SAW DURING THE PENN PANDEMIC THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING ACCESS TO PEOPLE TRYING TO GET. THIS SIMPLE ACCESS TO SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. THIS IS I BELIEVE A STATE- FISH AT ISSUE TO THE STATE THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO ADDRESS URGENTLY WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO BRING IN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND STATE AND THE WAY IT'S GOING TO CUT COSTS AND MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC. HI I'M GONNA ASK THE I. O. I GET A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH THE AUTHOR EARLIER AND I THINK WE AGREE ON A LOT OF POINTS. JUST SIMPLY CLARIFIED LIKE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE. THE THAT INSURES THAT ALL PROJECTS COMPLY WITH SAFETY REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING DIG SAFE REQUIREMENTS. PRIOR TO THE START OF THE PROJECT'S CONSTRUCTION. AND ALSO THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE A RIGHT TO APPEAL FOR A JUDICIAL REVIEW- AND THAT THAT PROCESS IS PRESERVED PRIOR TO CONSTRUCT CONSTRUCTION- CONSTRUCTION CONSTRUCTION BEGINNING AND I KNOW WE- THE YOU KNOW THE DETAILS ARE ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT SO I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. THROUGH THIS PROCESS I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL WILL BE HEARD AT THE NEXT POLICY COMMITTEE WE HAVE AMPLE TIME TO IN THAT PROCESS JUST TO PROVIDE THE CARE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE AND YOU MAKE COMMENTS TO THAT. IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENTS BUT I JUST WANTED YOU TO CONFIRM- SHOW- I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT DICK SAFE BEFORE SO FAR AS I KNOW WE DON'T CONTRADICT ANYTHING THAT WOULD INVOLVE DICK SAFE OR PROPER CONTRACTING- AGAIN WE ARE MORE THAN GLAD TO LOOK AT THAT WITH YOU AND IF YOU AND YOUR STAFF FEEL THAT- LANGUAGE IS NEEDED THERE WERE MORE THAN HAPPY. TO HAVE IT- THE SAME FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW AGAIN. HI AND I BELIEVE THE CITY'S WHEN THEY WENT NEUTRAL ON THIS THE CITIES COUNTIES. ALSO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S IN THERE BUT IF- IF YOU AND YOUR STAFF FEEL IT'S NOT WE'LL PUT IN CLARIFYING LANGUAGE YEAH I GUESS SO YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW AS- WE'VE HAD INCIDENTS IN OUR STATE THAT HAVE CAUSED. WILDFIRES AND THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER FIRES TIED TO. THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY OVERSIGHT AND INVESTMENT. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THIS THE BILL DOESN'T CUT INTO MAKE IN- YOU KNOW THE SYSTEMS A PROVIDER THESE IS YEAH I- I PLEDGE THAT I WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR FULLY SATISFIED. WITH ANY CLARIFICATION LANGUAGE YOU NEED OTHERWISE I'LL MAKE IT A TWO YEAR BILL I CAN'T GUARANTEE HOW LONG THAT WILL TAKE SO IT COULD BE IF IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET THE LANGUAGE THAT IT BECOMES A TWO YEAR BILL BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'LL BE THE CASE I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE THE CASE EITHER BUT I THINK WE CAN WORK OUT THE DETAILS OF FLEA. YEAH BUT I'M NOT SURE WE CAN DO IT BEFORE THE NEXT COMMITTEE HEARING BECAUSE WHEN THE LAWYERS GET INTO THIS AND I KNOW THIS FROM EXPERIENCE. EVERY PERIOD EVERY COMMA EVERY WORD WILL BE DISCUSSED YES AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFF ARE SATISFIED AND OTHERWISE IT BECOMES A TWO YEAR BATTLE HI LARRY A PLUS OUR PROMISE TO WORK THROUGH IT WITH GREATER THAT. NIGHT HI SURE WE CAN GET TO- A PLACE TO CLARIFY- AND I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE TOO SHAREHOLDERS BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'VE- I'VE WORKED HERE LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT. CAN POTENTIALLY UNRAVEL. BUT WE- WE PLAN TO WORK WITH YOU THROUGH THIS SO. THAT YOUR BILL COULD MOVE FORWARD. CENTER RECOMMENDED YOU WANNA MAKE A PROMISE JUST THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST I DON'T KNOW IF THIS BILL HAS BEEN MOVED YET BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AND TO TAKE MISTER DOCTOR QUICK FOR HIS WORK.
