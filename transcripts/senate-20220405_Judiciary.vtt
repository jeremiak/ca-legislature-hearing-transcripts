SUDDEN YOU SEE THAT ASSAULT

00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:54.452

TAXI DRIVER GETS CHARGED BECAUSE

DAY ASSUMING SOMEONE BRING. SAID

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:06.551
THAT ACTION TO CHALLENGE THIS.

AT THIS CAL. LAW WE WANT TO BE

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.655
ABLE TO. TO PUT THE COURT IN A

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.357
IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:13.591
THEY'RE HELD. TO ACCOUNT AND I

00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:15.260
JUST SAY ONE THING A CENTER SIX

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:16.861
IMPORTANT IN THIS REGARD. AND I

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:18.430
KIND OF TIE THIS INTO MY CLOTHES

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:20.398
AND ANSWER QUESTIONS IS. YOU

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:22.267
KNOW WHEN WE DID THE RESEARCH ON

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:24.335
LOOKING AT THE- BRIEFS THAT WERE

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:26.071
FILED BEFORE THE COURT. BY FOR

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:28.106
THE NC SUPREME COURT THERE IS A-

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:30.442
A BRIEF FILED BY THE FIREARMS

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:32.010
POLICY INSTITUTE CAN'T MAYBE

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:33.711
HAVE IT OFF. BUT BASICALLY THE

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:35.814
IDEA WAS THEY BROGHT A CAKE

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.415
THEY BROUGHT IN TO MAKE HIS CASE

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:39.451
A COURT AND SAID LOOK. IF THIS

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:40.718

THING IS GOING TO APPLY TO GUNS

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:43.788
AND SO THE ARGUMENT WELL THE

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:45.290
SUPREME COURT WASN'T AWARE OF

00:28:45.356 --> 00:28:46.958
THIS THEY HAD A BRIEF AN

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:47.792
ARGUMENT THAT WAS QUITE

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:49.727
BRILLIANT. IN TERMS OF MAKING

00:28:49.794 --> 00:28:50.862
THIS ARGUMENT AND THE COURT

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:53.398
REJECTED IT SO I THINK IT GAVE

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:57.402
US A LITTLE BIT MORE STRENGTH IN

00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:59.337

PRESENTED IN FEDERAL SATUTE

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:44.235
THEY GIVE NEARLY TAYLOR TO THE

00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:45.637
POTENTIAL DEFENDANT I THINK

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:46.871
THERE'S SOME OTHER ELEMENTS IN

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:48.706
HERE THAT THE MAKERS LEGALLY

00:31:48.773 --> 00:31:51.876
DEFENSIBLE THE ONE QUESTION I DO

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:54.545

THE TEXAS ABORTION BAN WHICH I

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.632
THINK WAS A HARD DECISION AND

00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:16.634
FRANKLY- I MISREAD A

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:21.139
CONSTITUTION. OF THE- YOU KNOW

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:23.207
THE SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.909
RIGHTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ON THE

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:25.877
FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AND A

00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:27.745
NUMBER OF OTHER- IMPLIED AND

00:32:27.812 --> 00:32:29.781
SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS SO HOW HOW

00:32:29.847 --> 00:32:32.216

LOSE FOOTING HERE IN UP HOLDING

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.262
THIS LAW OR DO YOU THINK THERE'S

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:45.663
AN INDEPENDENT. BASIS TO SORT OF

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:50.635
ARGUE THIS BEFORE THE COURT AND

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:52.537

WHERE THIS CHALLENGED WITHOUT.

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:57.075
AFFIRMING WHAT I VIEW IS THAT

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:59.310
PRESIDENT. I THINK THE ANSWER TO

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:01.879
THE QUESTION SIR I THINK THAT

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:04.048
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS.

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:04.682
FOR LEGISLATORS COULD DO

00:33:04.749 --> 00:33:06.551
WHATEVER THEY WANT RIGHT AND IT

00:33:06.617 --> 00:33:08.519
WOULD BE KIND OF NICE IN A

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:09.954
CERTAIN SENSE BECAUSE IT WOULD

00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:12.924
BE IN TERMS OF THE SUPREME COURT

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.891
CHANGED OPINION. OF WE'VE SEEN

00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:15.360
THIS YEAR'S COMPETITION THROUGH

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:16.794
COURT MAKES A DECISION AND

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:18.196
THAT'S THE LAW UNTIL THE NEXT.

00:33:18.262 --> 00:33:20.231
GROUP OF JUSTICES. OVERTURNING

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:21.699
RIGHT SEPARATE BUT EQUAL WAS

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:23.234
LEGAL UNTIL BROWN VERSUS BOARD

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:24.335
OF EDUCATION CAME AROUND.

00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:26.104
EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE OF THOSE

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.872
KINDS OF THINGS BUT CERTAINLY WE

00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:29.741
COULD DO THAT HOWEVER I WOULD

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:31.876
SIX FACT. THAT GIVING PRIVATE

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:35.179
RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE UNLIKE.

IT PORTION ISSUE WHERE THERE'S A

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:38.683
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. AND

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.952
THERE'S AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT.

00:33:41.018 --> 00:33:41.686
I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:43.788
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE IT

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.957

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.735
ILL ABOUT LEGAL DIAL WHICH WE

00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:58.936
DON'T TOUCH LEGAL GUN OWNERS

00:33:59.003 --> 00:34:00.371

DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT ANY OF

00:34:08.513 --> 00:34:09.714
THOSE THINGS IT DOESN'T.

00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:10.381
REGISTRATION GETTING PASSED OVER

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:11.883

ASSAULT WEAPONS AND GHOST GUNS.

00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:19.624
AND JUST TO ANSWER IT'S ENOUGH

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.459
TO PUT IN THE CLUBS- THE-

00:34:21.526 --> 00:34:23.494

I'M A BUT KNOWING SOLVE THAT

00:34:37.675 --> 00:34:38.743
PROBLEM THE SECOND THERE'S A

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.845
MEASURE BEFORE THE SLOW AB SIX

ABORTIONS. BUT JUST TO PUT A

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:05.636
FINER POINT AT THIS POINT WE ARE

00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:09.440
DEPENDENT YES LEGALLY ON THAT

PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL- IN

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:25.456
CREATIVE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:27.825
AS TO. ENFORCING CURRENTLY

00:35:27.892 --> 00:35:30.194
EXISTING GUN LAWS IN CALIFORNIA

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:31.529
AND SECONDLY IS THE HIGHLIGHT

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:33.097
THE ABSURDITY OF THE- SLAUGHTER

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:43.241
ULTIMATELY DECIDES THE TEXAS AND

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:45.810
FORCE A MECHANISM IS. CRAZY

00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:47.612
THAT'S RIGHT- IN AND I'M HOPEFUL

00:35:47.678 --> 00:35:49.280
THAT THAT THERE WILL BE A

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:50.781
FINDING THAT THE TEXAS

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:54.585
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IS CRAZY-

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:57.655
THE CHALLENGE OF COURSE IS THAT.

00:35:57.722 --> 00:36:00.024
WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF TWO MINDS

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:03.060
HERE WHERE. WE AT LEAST ME AND I

00:36:03.127 --> 00:36:04.762
THINK YOU JOIN ME CENTER

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:05.530
HERTZBERG AND HOPING THAT THE

00:36:05.596 --> 00:36:07.665
TEXAS LAWS FOUND TO BE

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:09.467
UNCONSTITUTIONAL- IN THE US

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:10.935
VOIDING THE LAW THAT MAY BE

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:13.304
PASSED ON THIS COMMITTEE TODAY-

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:14.772
HAVING SAID THAT I'M I'M GOING

00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:17.742
TO SUPPORT IT. BUT IT IS MY HOPE

00:36:17.808 --> 00:36:19.243
AND DESIRE THAT THAT ULTIMATELY

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.346
THIS BILL ACTUALLY NOT PROCEED-

00:36:22.413 --> 00:36:24.949
BECAUSE THE TEXAS LAW IS FOUND

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:26.884
TO BE WRONG ON CONSTITUTIONAL

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:29.253
AND CRAZY THIS IS SORT OF COMES

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.023
UNDER THE MONKEY SEE MONKEY DO

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:33.424
RUBRIC- AND- HOPEFULLY WE WON'T

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:35.660
BE DOING THE MONKEY SEE MONKEY

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:39.330
DO THINGS. ALL THE WAY TILL THE

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:41.532
- DATE OF THIS YEAR SESSION SO

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.568
HAVING SAID THAT IS OUR MOTION

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:46.904
SOME OF THE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.706
CAN MOVE THE BILL. K. BRIEFLY.

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:51.709
YES I JUST WANT TO KIND OF BREAK

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:52.543
A FINER POINT WHICH CENTERS

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.145
CHANGED IN WOULD YOU SAID OF

00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:56.147
COURSE THAT'S THE CASE BUT WHEN

00:36:56.213 --> 00:36:58.049
THE SITUATION HERE WHAT WHAT IF

00:36:58.115 --> 00:36:59.550
IT TURNS OUT WHEN THIS IS GOING

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:01.285
TO LITIGATION PROCESSES WHOM IT

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:03.387
DOES IT WORKS THAT IT HAS A

00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:04.689
CHILLING EFFECT THAT IS A

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:06.223
CONSEQUENCE IT HELPS GETTING

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.592
SOME GUNS OFF THE STREET WHICH

00:37:07.658 --> 00:37:08.859
THAT MIGHT HELP THESE ILLEGAL

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:10.595
GUNS MIGHT HELP PREVENT CERTAIN

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:11.662
KINDS OF THESE HORRIBLE

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.230
TRAGEDIES RIGHT SO THERE MIGHT

00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:14.498
BE A SILVER LINING WE MIGHT IN

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:15.900
FUTURE LEGISLATURES MIGHT WANT

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.935
TO COME BACK. ON THIS IT BY

00:37:18.002 --> 00:37:19.904
VIRTUE OF IT BEING EFFECTIVE SO

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:21.205
IT'S A GOOD DOUBLE SILVER LINING

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:23.341
IN THE SENSE OF WHAT THAT WHAT

00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:24.642
THAT LOOKS LIKE A LAST YOU WANNA

00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:25.910
I'M SOMEONE WHO ALWAYS USE

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:27.645
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT'S DUE AND

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:53.455
THOSE ARE CONCERNS ARE WITH THE

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.693
PROBLEMS BUT WOULD BE AFFECTED

BY THESE CHANGES TO EXISTING

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:00.696
LEGAL PROCEDURES. FIRST I WANT

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:02.431
TO FLY THE BREADTH OF HE BILL-

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:04.299
THE BILLS ARE FITTED REPEATEDLY

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:05.701
REFERRED TO AS PRODUCTS FOR

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:07.169
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:08.570
ACTUALLY THE BILL IS NOT LIMITED

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:09.738
TO IN ADDITION TO SIMPLY SAYS

01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:11.640
TIONS THAT CAUSE HARM SO WE

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:13.609
ACTUALLY VIEW THIS IS VIEW IT AS

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:14.243
AFFECTING POTENTIALLY THE

01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:15.344
MAJORITY OF CIVIL CASES WITH

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:16.612
THESE CHANGES THE DISCOVERY

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:19.081
BECAUSE THAT LANGUAGE ISN'T.

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:21.049
ACTUALLY THE DEFINITION THE BILL

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.484
- A SECOND THE SUBTLE PROVISIONS

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:24.052
HERE ARE NOT THE BIGGEST CHANGE

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:25.921
TO THE BILL IN OUR MIND- BUT WE

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:26.855
CERTAINLY ARE OPPOSED TO

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:28.023
POLICIES THAT PROHIBIT PARTIES

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.358
FROM CONTRACTING TO DO THAT IF

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:30.692
THEY WOULD LIKE. AND BELIEVE

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:31.593
THAT MAY DISINCENTIVE I

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:32.861
SETTLEMENT LEAD TO MORE CASES

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:35.130
BEING FOUGHT TO TRIAL THAT ISN'T

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:35.697
THE BIGGEST CHANGE INOUR

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:36.732
READING. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:38.967
CHANGE THE CHANGE. PROCEDURES

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:41.136
PARTICULARLY PROTECTIVE ORDERS-

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.938
THAT THIS BILL CREATES THAT. THE

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:43.438
PROFESSOR MADE THE POINT

01:15:43.505 --> 01:15:45.240
CORRECTLY DOES NOT. PROHIBIT THE

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:46.308
MAKRIS A STRONG PRESUMPTION

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:47.743
AGAINST PROTECTIVE ORDERS. AND

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:49.111
THAT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:50.045
SOME CONTEXT PROTECTIVE ORDERS

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:51.179
ARE REGULARLY USED IN

01:15:51.246 --> 01:15:52.281
LITIGATION. WHEN THERE ARE

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:54.383
DOCUMENTS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT

01:15:54.449 --> 01:15:55.484
BE SOMETHING THE PARTIES

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:56.852
DISAGREE ABOUT TO FACILITATE THE

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.620
EXCHANGE I USE THE MY LITIGATED.

01:15:58.687 --> 01:15:59.655
IT'S VERY COMMON BASICALLY

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.189
YOU'RE SAYING HEY. WE MAY NOT

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:02.691
AGREE ON WHERE THESE ARE PUBLIC.

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:03.959
BUT LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE AND

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.560
COME TO THE COURT IF WE HAVE TO

01:16:05.627 --> 01:16:07.663
AND LET'S EXCHANGE NOW. AND WE

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:08.764
WILL PROVIDE ABOUT THAT FOR THE

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.499
COURT SUBSEQUENTLY PURSUANT TO

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:12.100
THIS ORDER IF IT COMES UP. THE

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:13.302
FACILITY DISCOVERY I USE THEM IN

01:16:13.368 --> 01:16:14.536
CIVIL RIGHTS CASES RELATED TO

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:16.338
POLICE POLICIES. WE MIGHT SAY WE

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:17.372
DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU THE

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:19.308
POLICY ON HOW THE POLICE CLEAR

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:20.542
AN ARMED ROOM. THAT COULD BE

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:22.444
DANGEROUS TO POLICE CAN GIVE IT

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:23.712
TO UNDER PROTECTIVE ORDER. AND

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:25.948
THEN WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT IF

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:26.815
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT PUBLIC

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:28.483
LATER. SO THESE ARE NORMAL

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:29.718
DISCOVERY PRACTICES PRACTICED IN

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:31.453
IN. THE I WOULDN'T SAY THE

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:31.954
MAJORITY BUT OF. A VERY

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.055
SUBSTANTIAL CHUNK OF CIVIL

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:33.822

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:35.123
ABOUT CREATING A PRESUMPTION

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:38.927
AGAINST THEM. FOR PERSONAL.

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:42.097

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:54.810
LANGUAGE WHICH IS USED IN THE

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:57.145

01:20:22.784 --> 01:20:24.753
ENVIRONMENTAL WELL THAT'S NOT

01:20:24.819 --> 01:20:25.921
THE TEXT IT DIDN'T FIX IT THAT'S

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:28.223

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:36.431
PUBLIC HAZARDOUS SECRETS THE

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:39.234

EVEN THE CONSUMER PORTS TOUCH

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:45.840

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:56.518

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:58.887
MAKING CALLS EVERYTHING VERSUS A

01:20:58.954 --> 01:20:59.854

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:13.468
BAR AND MUSHING THEM ALTOGETHER.

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.036

OXYCONTIN EXAMPLE- THE IT WAS IT

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:28.076
WAS LITIGATION BETWEEN THAT

01:27:28.142 --> 01:27:31.846
PRODUCERS OF THE PROJECT- AND

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:33.514
THOSE THAT HAD BEEN HURT RIGHT.

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:37.418
BUT THERE WERE BUT THERE WERE.

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:40.221
OTHER PARTIES THAT HAD TO MAKE

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:42.790
THAT. PARTICULAR DRUG AVAILABLE

01:27:42.857 --> 01:27:45.727
LIKE DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS AND-

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:50.098
AND IN THAT PART AND SO- WOULD

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:52.400
IT YOUR BILL REQUIRE THE

01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:54.469
DISCLOSURE AND I'M NOT TALKING

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:55.803
ABOUT THE THOSE AT

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:56.371
OVERPRESCRIBED BECAUSE THAT

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:57.905
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT ISSUE

01:27:57.972 --> 01:28:00.475
RIGHT- THE MILLS THAT STARTED

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:03.711
CHURNING OUT- HILLS FOR ANYBODY

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:05.279
BUT- PRESCRIPTIONS FOR ANYBODY

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:06.881
THAT WANTED HIM OUT TALK ABOUT

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:09.584
THOSE I'M TALKING ABOUT- THIRD

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:11.719
PARTIES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PART

01:28:11.786 --> 01:28:15.289
OF THE- OF THE- THE SALE IN THE

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:17.925
PURCHASE OF THE PROJECT. BUT

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:20.795
DIDN'T PRODUCE IT NECESSARILY

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:23.598
WORK WERE ACCEPTING THE- THE

01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:26.401
ASSURANCES OF THAT OF THE-

01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:28.403
MANUFACTURE THAT IT WAS A GOOD

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:30.371
PRODUCT AND IT SERVED ITS

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:32.473
PURPOSE WHICH LATER ENDED UP NOT

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.841
BEING TRUE CORRECT EVAN LOW

01:28:33.908 --> 01:28:35.643
PROFESSOR OF SOFT BETTER ANSWER

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:37.278
BUT WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY IS

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:38.579
THIS WE WANT TO HOLD EVERYONE

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:40.281
RESPONSIBLE AND WHAT I'VE HEARD

01:28:40.348 --> 01:28:42.750
FROM DOCTORS- SINCE WE DISCOVER

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:44.552
THE OXY CODE IN AN OXYCONTIN

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:46.821
WERE SO ADDICTIVE. IT WAS NOT

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:49.257
THE WAY IT WAS SOLD TO THEM IT'S

01:28:49.323 --> 01:28:51.359
NOT WHAT THEY WERE TROUBLED BY

01:28:51.426 --> 01:28:52.126
THE MANUFACTURER RIGHT IF THIS

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:53.928
BILL IS SIGNED INTO LAW AND

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:55.430
THESE COMPANIES SEE THAT THEY'RE

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:57.198
GONNA BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

01:28:57.265 --> 01:28:59.901
THEIR LIES THEN MY HOPE WOULD BE

01:28:59.967 --> 01:29:01.502
IS THEY WOULDN'T LIE TO OTHER

01:29:01.569 --> 01:29:02.704
PEOPLE DOCTORS WITH THIS CASE

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.872
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DRUGS SO I

01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:08.109
THINK RIGHT NOW INPUT- COMPANIES

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:09.477
DRUG COMPANIES ANY COMPANY.

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:10.712
THEY'RE NOT TOO WORRIED THEY

01:29:10.778 --> 01:29:12.647
KNOW THAT THEY CAN GO TO COURT

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:14.148
AND THEY CAN GET THIS

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:15.483
INFORMATION SEALED AND THAT WE

01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:17.185
WON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR PRODUCT

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:18.820
CAN ACTUALLY DO TO SOMEONE BUT

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:20.254
ONCE THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE

01:29:20.321 --> 01:29:21.589
GONNA BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE I

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:24.025
THINK WE CAN SEE CHANGE BUT

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:24.525
PROFESSOR AND IF THERE'S

01:29:24.592 --> 01:29:25.560
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD. WELL

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.595
I AGREE WITH THAT I'M JUST

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:28.830
TRYING TO EXTRAPOLATE TED THEIR

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:30.765
CONCERN IS THAT THEY DON'T GET

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.400
LOOPED IN ON SOMETHING THAT THEY

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:34.602
HAD NO THAT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW-

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:35.737
BUT THEY DIDN'T PRODUCE THE

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:37.739
PRODUCT IS SO THAT IF YOU'VE GOT

01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:38.706
AN ANSWER THAT I DO SO THE

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:43.211
HISTORY. WILL ACTUALLY COTTON IS

01:29:43.277 --> 01:29:45.780
AT THE STATE OF WEST GENUSS THE-

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:46.380
PADUCAH. TO TWO AND THOUSAND

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:47.849
FOUR THAT CASE WAS SETTLED. AND

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:50.184
IT WAS SETTLED BUT- APPARENTLY

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.252
FOR A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY BUT

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:53.020
THE JUDGE INVOLVED IN THAT CASE

01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:55.189
CREATED A PROTECTIVE ORDER. SO

01:29:55.256 --> 01:29:56.591
THAT NONE OF THE TROOPS OF THE

01:29:56.657 --> 01:29:58.092
OVER PRESCRIPTION OVER ADDICTIVE

01:29:58.159 --> 01:30:01.195
PROPERTIES. AND THE RATCHETING

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:03.731
UP OF THE DOSAGES CAME OUT TO

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:06.334
THE PUBLIC AS A RESULT FROM TWO

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.802
THOUSAND FOUR TO AT LEAST TWO

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:08.870
THOUSAND SIXTEEN ANOTHER TWELVE

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:10.071
YEARS. UNTIL INFORMATION WAS

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:12.640
RELEASED TO THEM TO THE L. A.

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:15.042
TIMES. DOCTORS INNOCENT DOCTORS

01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:17.211
ARE SEEING PATIENTS WHO DIDN'T

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:18.713
KNOW ABOUT THIS WHO DIDN'T

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.448
UNDERSTAND THAT THESE THINGS

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:21.449
WERE BEING GROSSLY

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:23.117
OVERPRESCRIBED AND WE'RE GROSSLY

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:25.586
ADDICTIVE. LATER ON A JUDGE A

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:27.421
FEDERAL JUDGE IN CLEVELAND OHIO

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:29.323
AT TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL CASES

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:31.859
IN FRONT OF HIM. AND HE CREATED

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:33.694
UMBRELLA PROTECTIVE ORDER A

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:35.363
COMPLETE CONE OF SILENCE SO

01:30:35.429 --> 01:30:37.465
AGAIN. THE PUBLIC HAD NOT NO

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:40.835
IDEA WHATSOEVER. FTA WHICH WAS

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:42.503
TRYING TO INVESTIGATE THIS IS A

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:44.939
POINT THAT- STERN RIGHT FTA WAS

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:46.374
SHUT OUT OF THE PROCESS THEY

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.875
COULDN'T INVESTIGATE. AND MOST

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:50.044
IMPORTANTLY THE DOCTORS THE GOOD

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:51.946
HONEST MY PARENTS FOR DOCTORS

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:54.248
THE GOOD HONEST DOCTORS REACHES

95% OF THEM OUT THERE. JUST

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.685
SIMPLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE

01:30:57.752 --> 01:30:59.587
OXYCONTIN WASN'T WORKING AND

01:30:59.654 --> 01:31:01.589
THEY BOUGHT INTO. TO PRODUCE

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:03.758
SPIEL BECAUSE THIS JUDGE IN

01:31:03.825 --> 01:31:06.727
CLEVELAND FRANKLY HAD KEPT TWO

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:07.728
THOUSAND CASES SECRET ALONG WITH

01:31:07.795 --> 01:31:13.067

LOOK AT IT AND SEE IF THERE'S A

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:11.859

SOME OF THE- CONVERSATION HAS

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:21.903
PASSED. OR WHERE I WAS BUT- A

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:24.138
INITIALLY. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:27.275
THERE WAS A DISCONNECT- WITH

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:29.043
CENTER WHITE HOUSE SKIS CONCERN

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:31.178
ON YOURS BECAUSE I THINK HE WAS

01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:32.947
TALKING ABOUT OVERLY BROAD AND

01:32:33.014 --> 01:32:34.548
YOU THOUGHT THAT ONE WORD WAS

01:32:34.615 --> 01:32:36.651
GONNA DRESS IS OVERLY BROAD I

01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:39.987
DON'T THINK IT DOES. A. N. N.

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:41.188
AND SO I THINK IT GETS

01:32:41.255 --> 01:32:43.891
SYNTHESIZED MAYBE I WOULD SAY

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:45.826
GIVEN ALL THE DISCUSSION. THAT

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:48.195
THIS BILL ADDRESSES A PROBLEM

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:52.500
THAT WAS REALLY EMPLOYEE. YOU

01:32:52.566 --> 01:32:54.735
KNOW DEMONSTRATED AND I SUSPECT

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:56.771
WE ALL REALLY WANTED TO BE

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:58.272
ADDRESSED. AND THEN THERE'S A

01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:00.474
PROCESS AND THERE'S A QUESTION

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:01.575
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PROCESS

01:33:01.642 --> 01:33:03.244
ACT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES A

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:04.912
PROBLEM AND THEN THERE'S A

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:05.513
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:07.682
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND THE

01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:10.785
PROCESSES IT AND SO I'M WITH THE

01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:13.421
GROUP THAT- I WANT TO GIVE YOU

01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:15.389
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS.

01:33:15.456 --> 01:33:16.590
BUT I JUST HOPE THERE'S NOT

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:18.626
KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THOSE ARE

01:33:18.693 --> 01:33:21.362
THE ISSUES IT AND THOSE ARE THE

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:23.597
THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE ASKED. IN

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:25.800
A CLEAR WAY TO MAKE SURE AS THIS

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:28.636
MOVES OR COMES BACK THAT IT IT

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:30.404
DOES ALL THAT IN IT AND THIS

01:33:30.471 --> 01:33:32.473
BILL WAS SO BIG BECAUSE IT

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:35.609
ADDRESSES SUCH A BIG PROBLEM.

01:33:35.676 --> 01:33:37.078
THAT WHETHER IT'S DISCOVERY OR

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:38.646
FOR OTHER THINGS IT HAS THE

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:40.548
POSSIBILITY REALLY ROPING A LOT

01:33:40.614 --> 01:33:42.850
OF THINGS IN HERE AND SO. I'M

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:45.219
JUST HOPING THAT MAYBE IT WAS

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:46.721
SOME OF THE SENATORS THAT MADE

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:47.922
COMMENT YOU'LL GROUND TROOPS

01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:49.724

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:52.259
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES IT AND THAT

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:55.162
LEADS TO. THE POINT THAT YES-

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:56.364
IT'S SUCH A BIG PROBLEM THAT

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:57.798
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I'M GONNA

01:33:57.865 --> 01:33:59.767
VOTE TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD IN

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:03.371
THE HOPES THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:04.605

WORKING WITH US ALSO ON SOME

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:12.313
CLARIFICATION- AND IT. THIS IS

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:15.216
AN IMPORTANT POLICY HAS TO BE AT

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:17.985
ACTUALLY- INTERPRETED AND THE

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:19.754
POTENTIALLY ENFORCED BY A JUDGE

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.455
AND SO ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:23.224
MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH FOR.

01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:24.892
THE JUDGE TO BE ABLE TO.

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:26.694
PROPERLY INTERPRET THIS IS A

01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:28.429
QUESTION I AND I DAHLE DIRECTED

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:30.898
TO USE OUR LEYVA BUT MY GUESS IS

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:31.732
THAT- PROFESSORS IT TURNS

01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:32.433
PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO TAKE

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:35.970
IT. SO I'M LOOKING AT PAGE FIVE

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:36.670
AND I'M LOOKING AT THE

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:38.806
PRESUMPTION THAT SAYS. THE PARTY

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:39.573
REQUESTING THE ORDER

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.608
DEMONSTRATES THAT THE

01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:41.909
PRESUMPTION IN FAVOR OF

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:43.911
DISCLOSURES CLEARLY OUTWEIGHED

01:34:43.978 --> 01:34:46.113
IF YOU RECOGNIZE THAT. BOB I

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:49.717
ASSUME THAT THIS IS A REBUTTABLE

01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:50.885
PRESUMPTION RIGHT. RIGHT AND

01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:52.820
IT'S REMARKABLE BY A

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:56.957
PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE.

01:34:57.024 --> 01:35:00.194
BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE IS NOT

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:02.696
CUSTOMARY LANGUAGE. WOULD YOU

01:35:02.763 --> 01:35:04.832
LIKE ME TO ANSWER SOME YES

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:08.469
PLEASE YES ARE THE WAITING

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:14.375
PROCESS IS DEFINED AS. ARE

01:35:14.442 --> 01:35:17.778
CLEARLY OUTWEIGH IT IT'S NOT

01:35:17.845 --> 01:35:19.814
UNCOMMON FOR LEGISLATION TO HAVE

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.316
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T SPECIFY

01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:23.984
CURRENT CONVINCING EVIDENCE IS

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:25.886
SUPPOSED TO A PREPONDERANCE OF

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:27.088
EVIDENCE AS OPPOSED TO PROVE

01:35:27.154 --> 01:35:28.789
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THIS

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.157
RESERVE IT'S CLEAR AND

01:35:30.224 --> 01:35:31.759
CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT USES

01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:34.095
THE WERE WERE CLEARLY OUTWEIGHED

01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:34.662
BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:37.264
PHRASE. ORDINARILY IN THE

01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:39.166
LEGISLATION THAT I HAVE READ AT

01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:41.502
LEAST- PUTTING IN A BURDEN OF

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:43.304
PROOF WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE

01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:44.805
IN THIS SITUATION RATHER THE

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:46.841
PHRASE CLEARLY OUTWEIGHED GIVES

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:48.809
THE JUDGE GARDENS IS THE

01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:52.246
INFORMATION THAT SOUGHT TO BE

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:52.913
PROTECTED CLEARLY OUT MORE.

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:54.381
CLEARLY OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC

01:35:54.448 --> 01:35:56.250
INTEREST IN THE IN THE INSTANCE

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:58.519
OF HOW YOU CREATE AN IPHONE THE

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:00.020
ANSWER IS GOING TO BE US IN THE

01:36:00.087 --> 01:36:01.889
ANSWER AND THE INSTANT SUPPORT

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:02.490
YOUR PROTECT SOMETHING THAT'S

01:36:02.556 --> 01:36:03.557
DEFECTIVE HATCH IS GOING TO BE

01:36:03.624 --> 01:36:05.993
NOW. BUT THE OUTWEIGHED WORD

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.228
MEANS THE JUDICIAL DISCRETION IS

01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:09.130
GOING TO BE EXERCISED BY EACH

01:36:09.196 --> 01:36:12.066
INDIVIDUAL JUDGE TO SAY BASED ON

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:14.001
WHAT I'VE HEARD. IS YOU

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:15.736
SUBMITTED TO ME COUNSEL YOUR

01:36:15.803 --> 01:36:18.005
ARGUMENTS I'D THE JUDGE BELIEVES

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:19.773
THAT IT HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.376
CLEARLY OUTWEIGHED SO FIRST LET

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:25.246
ME SURE CUT YOU OFF. YEARS WORTH

01:36:25.312 --> 01:36:26.647
. MY EXPERIENCE IS THEJUDGES

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:29.150
ACTUALLY LIKE US TO DEFINE THE

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:31.018
EVIDENTIARY STANDARD THAT

01:36:31.085 --> 01:36:34.288
THEY'RE IN REQUIRED TO. EMPLOY

01:36:34.355 --> 01:36:35.923
IN THE T'S WHY

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:38.192
QUESTION AND I ASSUME THAT IT'S

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:39.527
A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT

01:36:39.593 --> 01:36:41.262
CAN BE OVERCOME BY A

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:42.396
PREPONDERANCE ALTHOUGH THAT THE

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:44.765
USING THE PREPONDERANCE STANDARD

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:46.867
THAT THE COURT THE NEEDS TO LOOK

01:36:46.934 --> 01:36:47.801
TO SEE. IF IT'S CLEARLY

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:48.869
OUTWEIGHED BY SPECIFIC AND

01:36:48.936 --> 01:36:50.304
SUBSTANTIAL OVERRIDING

01:36:50.371 --> 01:36:52.039
CONFIDENTIALITY INTERESTS SO I'M

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:53.440
THAT'S THAT'S ALL I'M

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:55.309
INTERPRETING IT AND I SUPPOSE

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:57.178
WHEN SOMEBODY LOOKS BACK AT THE

01:36:57.244 --> 01:36:58.279
LEGISLATIVE. HISTORY THEY'LL

01:36:58.345 --> 01:37:00.247
HEAR THOSE COMMENTS SO THAT'S

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:02.850
THAT'S POINT ONE. POINT TWO IS

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:06.120
THAT- AND IT WAS MY SUGGESTION

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:08.189
CONCERNED I THINK THAT YOU- AT

01:37:08.255 --> 01:37:10.157
LEAST INDIRECTLY ADDRESSED THAT

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:12.193
CONCERN THE CONCERN IS THAT. IF

01:37:12.259 --> 01:37:13.827
THERE IS A THIRD PARTY WHO IS

01:37:13.894 --> 01:37:15.663
SUBPOENAED FOR INFORMATION FOR

01:37:15.729 --> 01:37:17.765
EXAMPLE A DOWNSTREAM SUPPLIER

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.500
AND UPSTREAM SUPPLIER OF

01:37:19.567 --> 01:37:22.469
CERTAIN- INFORMATION THAT THEY

01:37:22.536 --> 01:37:24.305
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND I WE'VE

01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:25.539
WE'VE MENTIONED ANALYSIS BUT

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:27.775
THEY HAVE A- AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:37:27.841 --> 01:37:30.477
BE ABLE TO. OBJECT AND THAT THAT

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:33.280
THAT THAT THAT THAT POINT IN

01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:35.282
TIME I'M NOT SURE THAT THE-

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.851
STANDARD SHOULD APPLY TO THEM

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:39.486
THEY'RE NOT A PART OF THE

01:37:39.553 --> 01:37:40.854
LITIGATION BUT THEY SHOULD BE

01:37:40.921 --> 01:37:42.056
ABLE TO PROTECT OUR OWN

01:37:42.122 --> 01:37:44.792
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY- IF THE

01:37:44.858 --> 01:37:48.229
COURT SO FINDS THAT THAT- IT IS

01:37:48.295 --> 01:37:49.830
IN THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST TO

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:55.803
PROTECT. OTHERS NOW THIS BILL

01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:56.437

PHILOSOPHIC CHALLENGE FOR US THE

01:37:57.838 --> 01:37:58.539
CHEN. THAT SOMEBODY'S GOING TO

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.474
PAY THE PRICE FOR THE BILL

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:02.176
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY THE

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:02.943
PRICE WE'RE GONNA BE INDIVIDUAL-

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:04.411

MATTER IN A MUCH MUCH MUCH

01:38:08.415 --> 01:38:10.851
HIGHER LEVEL. THAN THEY MIGHT

AND TRANSPARENCY BETTER PUBLIC

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.835

. I JUST HAVE A QUESTION IN

02:05:57.349 --> 02:05:59.785
REGARDS TO- I THINK THIS IS

02:05:59.852 --> 02:06:02.688
REALLY AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY

02:06:02.755 --> 02:06:04.857
FOR THE SCHOOL TO KNOW- GET

02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:08.093
INFORMATION. WITH THE APPROVAL

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:12.431
OF THE PARENTS- ABOUT- THINGS

02:06:12.498 --> 02:06:14.266
THAT WOULD HELP THE SCHOOL TO

02:06:14.333 --> 02:06:16.368
BETTER PREPARE A GOOD LEARNING

02:06:16.435 --> 02:06:18.771
ENVIRONMENT AND I SAY THIS AS- A

02:06:18.837 --> 02:06:21.707
MOTHER OF FIVE CHILDREN IT-

02:06:21.774 --> 02:06:24.576
THAT- NEEDED EXTRA HELP IN THEIR

02:06:24.643 --> 02:06:25.611
LEARNING AND THEY HAD

02:06:25.678 --> 02:06:27.379
DISABILITIES AND SO IT'S REALLY

02:06:27.446 --> 02:06:29.748
TOUGH ON THE TEACHERS- TO FIGURE

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:31.150
OUT WHAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT

02:06:31.216 --> 02:06:33.552
THEY SHOULD CREATE AND- AND THIS

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:35.788
THIS PROVIDES IN. A PATHWAY TO

02:06:35.854 --> 02:06:37.356
BE ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION BUT

02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:40.526
I WANT TO BE VERY CERTAIN THAT

02:06:40.592 --> 02:06:42.695
UPON SHARING INFORMATION WITH

02:06:42.761 --> 02:06:45.030
THE SCHOOL THAT THE INFORMATION

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:48.067
IS KEPT IN A CONFIDENTIAL-

02:06:48.133 --> 02:06:51.537
ENVELOPE. ONLY TO BE OPENED BY-

02:06:51.603 --> 02:06:54.907
INDIVIDUALS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A

02:06:54.974 --> 02:06:56.775
NEED TO SEE THAT INFORMATION. I

02:06:56.842 --> 02:07:00.112
WOULDN'T BET YOU KNOW IT IT WILL

02:07:00.179 --> 02:07:01.180
BE ALL HAVE SMALL SCHOOL

02:07:01.246 --> 02:07:02.548
DISTRICTS TRICKS IN OUR IN OUR

02:07:02.614 --> 02:07:05.217
IN OUR DISTRICTS. THAT HAVE VERY

02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:08.854
VERY- LIMITED NUMBER OF TEACHERS

02:07:08.921 --> 02:07:10.990
AND STAFF IN THE FRONT OFFICE

02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:12.858
THEY KNOW EACH OTHER THEY GAS UP

02:07:12.925 --> 02:07:15.828
THEIR FRIENDS- THEY WERE ALL

02:07:15.894 --> 02:07:17.763
FROM MY NEIGHBORHOOD INSIDE WANT

02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:19.999
TO MAKE SURE. FOR INFORMATION.

02:07:20.065 --> 02:07:22.568
IT WOULD. BUT THEN WOULD BE USED

02:07:22.634 --> 02:07:25.004
TO TRACK MY KID- AS THEY GROW

02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:27.539
OLDER AND MAYBE GROW GROW OUT OF

02:07:27.606 --> 02:07:29.341
SOME OF THAT BEHAVIORAL ISSUES

02:07:29.408 --> 02:07:31.243
THAT ARE CHALLENGES FOR

JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE-

02:07:35.814 --> 02:07:39.018
I ASKED THE QUESTION AS TO

02:07:39.084 --> 02:07:39.518
WHETHER IT WOULD BE KEPT

02:07:39.585 --> 02:07:42.654
CONFIDENTIAL- AND THE ANSWER IS

02:07:42.721 --> 02:07:45.357
YES BUT I REALLY DO THINK THAT

02:07:45.424 --> 02:07:46.425
IT PROBABLY REQUIRES A LITTLE

02:07:46.492 --> 02:07:49.328
BIT STRONGER THAT THAT THE

02:07:49.395 --> 02:07:52.297

THERE ANY CENTER HERTZBERG.

02:25:58.316 --> 02:26:04.122
YEAH- I SPENT MORE HUNDREDS OF

02:26:04.188 --> 02:26:07.425
HOURS NEGOTIATING- WHATEVER

02:26:07.492 --> 02:26:08.826
THESE THINGS THE FIRST ONE ON

02:26:08.893 --> 02:26:10.294
THE BALLOT FIRST ONE OFF THE

02:26:10.361 --> 02:26:12.029
BALLOT AND THE SECOND ONE ON THE

02:26:12.096 --> 02:26:15.533
BATH YOU KNOW TOP TWENTY FOUR.

02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:18.936
AND IT WAS TOUGH. VERY TOUGH

02:26:19.003 --> 02:26:21.038
BECAUSE UNLIKE INDUSTRIES OR YOU

02:26:21.105 --> 02:26:22.240
HAVE LIKE LABOR AGAINST

02:26:22.306 --> 02:26:23.774
MANAGEMENT THE LINES ARE PRETTY

02:26:23.841 --> 02:26:25.843
CLEAR OR THE DOCTORS AGAINST THE

02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:27.512
LAWYERS AND THE LIKE AND IT WAS

02:26:27.578 --> 02:26:29.914
CLEAR YOU KNOW THE KANA EASIER-

02:26:29.981 --> 02:26:31.482
POSITIONS YOU DON'T I MEAN WHEN

02:26:31.549 --> 02:26:33.084
YOU HAVE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

02:26:33.151 --> 02:26:36.187
THIS WAS VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE-

02:26:36.254 --> 02:26:38.222
ALL THESE COMPANIES THAT HAVE

02:26:38.289 --> 02:26:40.158
SOUGHT TO MONETIZE THE INTERNET

02:26:40.224 --> 02:26:41.993
HAS DONE IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS I

02:26:42.059 --> 02:26:43.561
CAN NAME SPECIFIC COMPANIES IT'S

02:26:43.628 --> 02:26:45.630
VERY DIFFICULT TO IS HARD FOR

02:26:45.696 --> 02:26:48.599
THEM ON THE ONE HAND. TO TRY TO

02:26:48.666 --> 02:26:49.600
COME TO AN AGREEMENT ABOUT

02:26:49.667 --> 02:26:51.369
HERE'S WHAT WE WANT VERSE THE

02:26:51.435 --> 02:26:53.171
CONSUMER GROUPS RIGHT AND- AND

02:26:53.237 --> 02:26:55.139
THE CONSUMER GROUPS BUT WE GET

02:26:55.206 --> 02:26:57.642
IT WILL GIVE US A LIST OF FORTY

02:26:57.708 --> 02:26:58.276
ONE THINGS WERE GIVEN TWENTY

02:26:58.342 --> 02:26:59.610
SEVEN OF THE THINGS IN THE

02:26:59.677 --> 02:27:00.444
GROCERY ASIANS BUT YOU KNOW

02:27:00.511 --> 02:27:03.314
THEY- DIDN'T UP SOME OF THE NAP

02:27:03.381 --> 02:27:04.282
SUPPORTING OF SOME OF THEM DID.

02:27:04.348 --> 02:27:06.284
BUT THE THING THAT WAS THE MOST

02:27:06.350 --> 02:27:07.485
AGO SHEETED THING HERE WHICH I

02:27:07.552 --> 02:27:09.220
WANT TO TALK ABOUT. WAS THE WHAT

02:27:09.287 --> 02:27:10.588
DOES IT MEAN TO IMPLEMENT THE

02:27:10.655 --> 02:27:13.658
LAW. OKAY EXISTS ALSO GOES TO MR

02:27:13.724 --> 02:27:16.160
MAKOWSKI IS MEASURED HERE TO.

02:27:16.227 --> 02:27:18.095
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO IMPLEMENT

02:27:18.162 --> 02:27:20.731
THE LAW. ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW

02:27:20.798 --> 02:27:22.200
WE GO THROUGH ALL THIS HEARTACHE

02:27:22.266 --> 02:27:23.701
TO GET SOMETHING PASSED BY THE

02:27:23.768 --> 02:27:24.969
VOTERS AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE

02:27:25.036 --> 02:27:27.271
CAN CHANGE IT IN ANY WAY WHERE

02:27:27.338 --> 02:27:27.905
THEY'RE GOING TO BE GUARDRAILS

02:27:27.972 --> 02:27:29.707
OR NOT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT

02:27:29.774 --> 02:27:32.210
WE DON'T TIME WE GET IN TAX

02:27:32.276 --> 02:27:35.413
POLICY WITHOUT LABOR POLICY. WEALL SORTS OF THINGS AND SO ONE

02:27:35.479 --> 02:27:36.647
OF THOSE GUARD RAILS LOOK LIKE.

02:27:36.714 --> 02:27:38.449
IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE QUITE

02:27:38.516 --> 02:27:39.684
FRANKLY LOOK HELLO THE HIP AT

02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:41.786
THE PARK RECEIVE IT OFF. BECAUSE

02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:43.554
I JUST WAS HERE TO. TO GET.

02:27:43.621 --> 02:27:46.457
PRIVATE FACTION BILL. BUT THAT

02:27:46.524 --> 02:27:47.892
WAS BASED UPON A DEEPLY WAS

02:27:47.959 --> 02:27:49.393
DIFFERENT THIS WAS NEGOTIATED

02:27:49.460 --> 02:27:51.696
DEAL. AND SO I JUST WANT TO

02:27:51.762 --> 02:27:52.563
REFERENCE THIS BECAUSE I DON'T

02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:53.898
SUPPORT THIS BUT WAS SUPPORT

02:27:53.965 --> 02:27:55.132
WITH WITH WITH SOME.

02:27:55.199 --> 02:27:56.934
QUALIFICATION I THINK YOU KNOW

02:27:57.001 --> 02:27:58.436
IN THE DISCUSSION AS WE ENGAGE

02:27:58.502 --> 02:27:59.737
IN PRIVACY GOING FORWARD I'M

02:27:59.804 --> 02:28:01.372
GONNA BE GONE IN TEN SECONDS OUT

02:28:01.439 --> 02:28:02.974
OF THE SHOP AND- THEY'LL BE

02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:04.709
SOMEBODY ELSE NEW SITTING IN

02:28:04.775 --> 02:28:05.476
THIS SEAT. BUT I THINK IT'S

02:28:05.543 --> 02:28:07.445
IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE

02:28:07.511 --> 02:28:09.013
INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY AND IN THAT

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:09.814
REGARD. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:11.449
WAS ONE OF THE- BIGGEST ISSUES

02:28:11.515 --> 02:28:12.416
THAT WAS NEGOTIATED AMONG

02:28:12.483 --> 02:28:15.152
EVERYBODY. WAS IMPLEMENTATION IN

02:28:15.219 --> 02:28:16.988
THE WORDS THE BALANCE OUT THE

02:28:17.054 --> 02:28:18.522
PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS

02:28:18.589 --> 02:28:20.825
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. BUT GOING

02:28:20.891 --> 02:28:22.793
FORWARD HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:24.895
THEY WERE GONNA HAVE. AND HERE

02:28:24.962 --> 02:28:26.831
WAS THE DEAL THAT WAS THE

02:28:26.897 --> 02:28:29.533
BIGGEST PIECE SECTION. IS C.

02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:31.335
PARAGRAPH SIX. THE LAW SHOULD BE

02:28:31.402 --> 02:28:32.903
AMENDED IF NECESSARY TO IMPROVE

02:28:32.970 --> 02:28:35.306
ITS OPERATIONS. PROVIDED THAT

02:28:35.373 --> 02:28:40.578
THE AMENDMENTS DO NOT COMPROMISE. OR WEAKENED CONSUMER PRIVACY.

02:28:40.645 --> 02:28:42.380
AB CRITICAL THE- APPROACH TO

02:28:42.446 --> 02:28:44.115
ADOPT FOUR WAS NO WEAKENING OF

02:28:44.181 --> 02:28:45.983
CONSUMER PRIVACY WHILE GIVING

02:28:46.050 --> 02:28:47.618
ATTENTION TO THE IMPACT ON

02:28:47.685 --> 02:28:49.754
BUSINESS AND INNOVATION. AND MY

02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:51.322
SUGGESTION AND TRYING TO READ

02:28:51.389 --> 02:28:52.757
THIS INTO THE RECORD FROM MY

02:28:52.823 --> 02:28:54.659
EXPERIENCE WAS THAT THIS WAS THE

02:28:54.725 --> 02:28:56.427
LANGUAGE IT WAS TOUGH. BECAUSE

02:28:56.494 --> 02:28:58.462
BUSINESSES OH MY GOD IF YOU GET

02:28:58.529 --> 02:28:59.664
OUT THERE AND CREATE THESE

02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:01.832
CHILLING EFFECT WITH ALL THESE

02:29:01.899 --> 02:29:02.433
NEW LAWS THAT THEN. EVERYBODY

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:03.968
COULD SUE US UNDER PRIVATE RIGHT

02:29:04.035 --> 02:29:05.403
OF ACTION THAT MAY HAVE A

02:29:05.469 --> 02:29:06.504
CHILLING EFFECT ON INNOVATION

02:29:06.570 --> 02:29:08.005
AND THAT WAS WHERE THE DELICATE

02:29:08.072 --> 02:29:10.341
BALANCE WAS. AND I DON'T ANSWER

02:29:10.408 --> 02:29:11.575
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THE

02:29:11.642 --> 02:29:13.377
QUESTION YOU WITH RESPECT TO

02:29:13.444 --> 02:29:15.046
SENATOR PANTS MEASURE OR CENTER

02:29:15.112 --> 02:29:15.680
WOULD HOUSE THESE MEASUREMENTS

02:29:15.746 --> 02:29:17.181
SUPPORT THEM BOTH TODAY. BUT I

02:29:17.248 --> 02:29:21.252
WANT TO PUT THAT IN THE NATION

02:29:21.319 --> 02:29:22.253
OUT THERE BECAUSE IT'S

02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:23.954
IMPORTANT- THEY HAVE HONOR

02:29:24.021 --> 02:29:26.290
INTEGRITY TO. WHAT WAS DISCUSSED

02:29:26.357 --> 02:29:27.458
AMONG ALL THE PARTIES NOW

02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:28.726
OBVIOUSLY FUTURE LEGISLATORS

02:29:28.793 --> 02:29:30.428
COULD DO WHAT THEY WANT. THEY

02:29:30.494 --> 02:29:31.562
CAN INTERPRET ANYWAY THEY DEEM

02:29:31.629 --> 02:29:33.731
APPROPRIATE. BUT I THINK IT'S

02:29:33.798 --> 02:29:34.832
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT LEVEL OF

02:29:34.899 --> 02:29:35.900
HISTORY IN THEIR STANDING OF

02:29:35.966 --> 02:29:37.535
WHAT HAPPENED. AND ALL OF THE

02:29:37.601 --> 02:29:38.703
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS

02:29:38.769 --> 02:29:40.504
OF NEGOTIATION AND WHY THIS WAS

02:29:40.571 --> 02:29:42.606
IMPORTANT AND- DOES THIS GREAT

02:29:42.673 --> 02:29:43.941
THAT CHILLING AFFECT WITHIN THE

02:29:44.008 --> 02:29:45.643
CONTEXT OF. BALANCING THE

02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:47.178
CRITICAL MESSAGE THE SAYS YOU

02:29:47.244 --> 02:29:49.780
EXPAND CONSUMER RIGHTS WELL NOT

02:29:49.847 --> 02:29:51.215
HAVING A CHILLING EFFECT ON

02:29:51.282 --> 02:29:52.683
INNOVATION SO WITH THAT. I

02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:54.352
WANTED TO. POINT THAT OUT TO THE

02:29:54.418 --> 02:29:56.020
HISTORY TO THE COMMITTEE. FROM

02:29:56.087 --> 02:29:57.355
SOMEBODY WHO WAS A PERCIPIENT

02:29:57.421 --> 02:30:01.158
WITNESS SOME TWELVE HUNDRED

02:30:01.225 --> 02:30:03.027
YEARS AGO. AND YEAH THAT SURE

02:30:03.094 --> 02:30:04.295
THAT WITH BUT WAS SUPPORTED BUT

02:30:04.362 --> 02:30:07.164
WITH THE ADMONITION THAT- I

02:30:07.231 --> 02:30:09.066
WOULD HOLD THE RIGHT TO WEAR.

02:30:09.133 --> 02:30:12.269
YOU KNOW DEAL WITH IT LATER. ANY

02:30:12.336 --> 02:30:14.405
OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FROM

02:30:14.472 --> 02:30:17.408
THE COMMITTEE. I DON'T SEE

02:30:17.475 --> 02:30:19.510
ANYBODY WITH ANY CONCERNS I HAVE

02:30:19.577 --> 02:30:22.113
SOME CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO THE-

02:30:22.179 --> 02:30:27.952
C. P. R. R. A. AND- AND THE NEED

02:30:28.018 --> 02:30:30.588
TO START MAKING EXCEPTIONS TO

02:30:30.654 --> 02:30:33.991
THAT- FOR. THE NEED TO ADD TO IT

02:30:34.058 --> 02:30:35.760
WHEN IT REALLY HASN'T BECOME

02:30:35.826 --> 02:30:38.129
EFFECTIVE YET AS A TOOL- IN THE

02:30:38.195 --> 02:30:41.298
TOOL BOX AND IN ADDITION TO THAT

02:30:41.365 --> 02:30:43.467
THE NEED FOR. A THE PRIVATE

02:30:43.534 --> 02:30:45.870
RIGHT OF ACTION WHAT Y. EIGHT Y.

02:30:45.936 --> 02:30:48.139
E. THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL

02:30:48.205 --> 02:30:50.775
YEAH. THE QUESTION AND- SO THANK

02:30:50.841 --> 02:30:52.276
YOU CENTERS FOR THE HISTORY

02:30:52.343 --> 02:30:53.544
LESSON ALTHOUGH I THINK I WAS

02:30:53.611 --> 02:30:56.180
AROUND THE SAME TIME SO I GUESS

02:30:56.247 --> 02:30:57.448
WE'RE BOTH TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS.

02:30:57.515 --> 02:31:00.518
OLD SO- I THINK ONE OF THE

02:31:00.584 --> 02:31:01.485
THINGS SOMEONE EMPHASIZE WHICH

02:31:01.552 --> 02:31:03.254
ENSURED THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT

02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:05.890
THIS IS A- I WILL SAY UNIQUE BUT

02:31:05.956 --> 02:31:07.691
THIS IS A VULNERABLE POPULATION

02:31:07.758 --> 02:31:09.026
RIGHT THESE ARE STUDENTS AND

02:31:09.093 --> 02:31:10.461
THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. THEY

02:31:10.528 --> 02:31:12.496
HAVE TO DOUBTS AND THE PROCTOR

02:31:12.563 --> 02:31:14.398
IN COMPANY IT IS NOT SOMETHING

02:31:14.465 --> 02:31:16.066
THAT THEY CHOSE SO THEY DIDN'T

02:31:16.133 --> 02:31:18.469
CHOOSE TO USE THIS COMPANY- THE

02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:19.703
SCHOOL OR WHOEVER YOU KNOW

02:31:19.770 --> 02:31:21.005
WHICHEVER THE THAT THAT

02:31:21.071 --> 02:31:22.907
TESTAMENTARY SAID YOU SHALL USE

02:31:22.973 --> 02:31:25.676
THIS PRODUCT AND COMPANY- AND-

02:31:25.743 --> 02:31:27.178
WHATEVER TRACKING COMPANY WANTS

02:31:27.244 --> 02:31:28.946
FROM YOU. YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE

02:31:29.013 --> 02:31:30.014
BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU CAN'T TAKE

02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:32.783
THE EXAM AND THAT EXAM MAY BE IN

02:31:32.850 --> 02:31:34.919
MANY CASES- MOST OF US THERE'S-

02:31:34.985 --> 02:31:36.487
THE EXAMS ARE PRETTY CRITICAL

02:31:36.554 --> 02:31:38.222
EIGHT OUT WE CAN'T SAY OH WELL I

02:31:38.289 --> 02:31:40.124
WILL TAKE THE EXAM THEN RIGHT.

02:31:40.191 --> 02:31:40.658
SO WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY A

02:31:40.724 --> 02:31:42.560
POPULATION A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO

02:31:42.626 --> 02:31:44.195
ARE. VULNERABLE BECAUSE THEY

02:31:44.261 --> 02:31:45.596
THEY THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE A

02:31:45.663 --> 02:31:47.364
CHOICE UNLESS THEY WANT TO GIVE

02:31:47.431 --> 02:31:48.899
UP THAT CAREER PATH OR WHATEVER

02:31:48.966 --> 02:31:50.568
THAT EXAM IS GOING TO LEAD TO. I

02:31:50.634 --> 02:31:51.936
THINK THAT CREATES THAT CREATES

02:31:52.002 --> 02:31:53.471
A PARTICULAR SITUATION AND ALSO

02:31:53.537 --> 02:31:54.805
THE PRICING COMPANY DOESN'T

02:31:54.872 --> 02:31:58.342
HAVE. ANY BUILT THEY CAN ASK FOR

02:31:58.409 --> 02:32:00.177
WHATEVER THEY WANT AND THERE'S

02:32:00.244 --> 02:32:02.780
NO LIMITATIONS THERE. AND SO

02:32:02.847 --> 02:32:04.615
THAT'S WHAT THE SEE THIS BILL

02:32:04.682 --> 02:32:06.784
SEEKS TO DO IS TO SAY **** YOU

02:32:06.851 --> 02:32:08.085
SHOULD BE COLLECTING ALL THE

02:32:08.152 --> 02:32:09.820
INFORMATION YOU CAN TRY TO GET

02:32:09.887 --> 02:32:10.721
YOU SHOULD BE TO COLLECTING JUST

02:32:10.788 --> 02:32:12.957
WHAT YOU NEED. AND ALSO WE NEED

02:32:13.023 --> 02:32:14.725
TO BE SO AGAIN TO PROTECT THE

02:32:14.792 --> 02:32:16.727
PRIVACY. BECAUSE AND THEN ALSO

02:32:16.794 --> 02:32:19.430
HOW LONG YOU HERE HANG ON TO THE

02:32:19.497 --> 02:32:20.798
DATA BECAUSE OF SOMEONE HACKS-YOUR DATABASE. ARE YOU

02:32:20.865 --> 02:32:21.999
COLLECTING LL THIS BIOMETRIC

02:32:22.066 --> 02:32:24.902
DATA AND SOMEONE GETS THAT DATA-

02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:26.303
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT SELLING IT BUT

02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:27.771
IF SOMEONE GETS THAT DATA

02:32:27.838 --> 02:32:29.840
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN SWITCH

02:32:29.907 --> 02:32:30.474
OUT YOUR EYEBALL IN THE FUTURE

02:32:30.541 --> 02:32:32.343
IF SOMEONE REYES STOLE YOU KNOW

02:32:32.409 --> 02:32:33.644
YOUR IDENTITY YOU NAME WITH. THE

02:32:33.711 --> 02:32:35.179
PHOTOMETRIC DATA RIGHT THAT IT'S

02:32:35.246 --> 02:32:36.647
LOST FOREVER IT'S AND IT'S NOW

02:32:36.714 --> 02:32:38.282
AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE FOREVER.

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:40.484
SO I THINK THERE'S PARTICULARLY

02:32:40.551 --> 02:32:41.252
ONLY TALKING AND MOBILE

02:32:41.318 --> 02:32:42.219
POPULATION PARTICULARLY

02:32:42.286 --> 02:32:44.655
SENSITIVE AND WE NEED TO BE SURE

02:32:44.722 --> 02:32:46.457
THEY GIVE THEM RECOURSE L. I. I.

02:32:46.524 --> 02:32:47.725
EASEMENT I'M NOT A PERSON IS

02:32:47.791 --> 02:32:49.693
REALLY INTO PRIVATE RIGHT OF

02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:50.728
ACTION I'D USUALLY I'M THE ONE

02:32:50.794 --> 02:32:56.934
PEOPLE SAYS WELL. BUILT FRAMED

02:32:57.001 --> 02:32:58.035
ACTION I'M NOT SUPPORTING IT.

02:32:58.102 --> 02:33:01.672
HE'S OF A- YES- BUT I THINK IN

02:33:01.739 --> 02:33:03.641
THIS IN THE GALLATIN FOR CASE-

02:33:03.707 --> 02:33:04.408

THE TEAM AND CJ AND SO FORTH-

02:33:07.678 --> 02:33:09.246
AND A PRIEST APPRECIATE THAT

02:33:09.313 --> 02:33:10.414
ACTUALLY WON THE MAJOR

02:33:10.481 --> 02:33:11.048
CONTRACTING COMPANIES ACTUALLY

02:33:11.115 --> 02:33:13.183
SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE I

02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:13.918
THINK WHEN IT COMES TO

02:33:13.984 --> 02:33:14.718
INNOVATION. THEY RECOGNIZE THE

02:33:14.785 --> 02:33:16.353
INNOVATION IS GOING TO BE ON HOW

02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:17.688
DO I COLLECT MORE AND MORE DATA

02:33:17.755 --> 02:33:19.356
ON PEOPLE THE INNOVATIONS HOW

02:33:19.423 --> 02:33:21.258
CAN I ACTUALLY DO A BETTER JOB

02:33:21.325 --> 02:33:22.960
PRACTICING AND DO IT BETTER

02:33:23.027 --> 02:33:23.594
WITHOUT ACTUALLY NEEDING MORE

02:33:23.661 --> 02:33:24.795
MORE INFORMATION THAT PUTS

02:33:24.862 --> 02:33:25.896
POTENTIALLY CAN PUT THE TEST

02:33:25.963 --> 02:33:27.798
TAKER AT RISK THAT THE COMPANY

02:33:27.865 --> 02:33:29.767
HAS TO NOT HAVE TO USE IT YOU'LL

02:33:29.833 --> 02:33:31.602
HAVE TO HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION

02:33:31.669 --> 02:33:33.904
TO BE ABLE TO STILL DO THE JOB

02:33:33.971 --> 02:33:35.673
AND- AND THEN AGAIN OF COURSE

02:33:35.739 --> 02:33:36.307
THEIR CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY THE-

02:33:36.373 --> 02:33:37.408
TEST ADMINISTRATOR TO SCHOOL OR

02:33:37.474 --> 02:33:38.509
WHATEVER BODIES THE TEST

02:33:38.576 --> 02:33:39.643
ADMINISTRATOR AND THAT'S THE

02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:41.879
OPPORTUNITY FOR INNOVATION. SO

02:33:41.946 --> 02:33:43.681
THE L. A. I DO THINK THAT WE

02:33:43.747 --> 02:33:46.016

02:33:49.386 --> 02:33:50.921

COMPANY IS NOT ONE THAT THEY

02:34:04.501 --> 02:34:06.503
CHOSE GOOD SIR FORCED UPON THEM.

02:34:06.570 --> 02:34:07.504
IS IN A PARTICULARLY HORRIBLE

02:34:07.571 --> 02:34:08.505
SITUATION THEY NEED TO HAVE THE

02:34:08.572 --> 02:34:11.575

JUST FROM A PROCEDURAL

03:12:43.518 --> 03:12:46.521
STANDPOINT THOUGH- WHEN WE WENT

03:12:46.588 --> 03:12:48.323
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE

03:12:48.390 --> 03:12:50.992

03:12:57.666 --> 03:12:59.834

RIGHT. YEAH IN JANUARY OF TWENTY. WE STARTED THIS IS HERE AND WE

03:13:19.321 --> 03:13:22.090
WERE TWENTY TWO. EITHER WAY- I

03:13:22.157 --> 03:13:24.693
THINK MY POINT IS THAT- THIS IS

03:13:24.759 --> 03:13:26.594
RELATIVELY NEW AND STILL BEING

03:13:26.661 --> 03:13:27.529
ROLLED OUT I THINK MINOR

03:13:27.595 --> 03:13:28.363
STANDARD THERE ARE SOME

03:13:28.430 --> 03:13:30.532
EXCEPTIONS THAT ARE STILL BEING-

03:13:30.598 --> 03:13:32.701
TEASED OUT. BUT MY RECOLLECTION

03:13:32.767 --> 03:13:35.236
IS THAT ALL THE PARTIES WERE

03:13:35.303 --> 03:13:37.505
BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THIS ISSUE IN

03:13:37.572 --> 03:13:39.140
THERE WERE CONCESSIONS AND

03:13:39.207 --> 03:13:41.543
UNDERSTANDINGS MADE DURING THAT

03:13:41.609 --> 03:13:45.480
PROCESS IN MY ONLY CONCERN BY

03:13:45.547 --> 03:13:47.215
LEESON AT THE PROCEDURAL LEVEL

03:13:47.282 --> 03:13:50.385
IS IF WE WENT THROUGH THAT

03:13:50.452 --> 03:13:52.387
ENTIRE PROCESS. DODD WE HAVE TO

03:13:52.454 --> 03:13:53.989
REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS WHETHER

03:13:54.055 --> 03:13:55.724
THEY BE IN THE SPECIAL INTEREST

03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:58.693
FOR THE POLICY REALM THAT WHEN

03:13:58.760 --> 03:14:00.562
WE AGREED TO SOMETHING. THAT

03:14:00.628 --> 03:14:01.830
WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY GOING TO

03:14:01.896 --> 03:14:03.999
TAKE A SECOND THIRD AND FIFTH

03:14:04.065 --> 03:14:07.035
BITE AT THE APPLE- THAT THAT

03:14:07.102 --> 03:14:08.370
SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIES THE

03:14:08.436 --> 03:14:09.571
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN

03:14:09.637 --> 03:14:11.873
PLACE WITHIN IT. SO I GUESS YOU

03:14:11.940 --> 03:14:13.708
KNOW MAYBE IT'S A QUESTION TO

03:14:13.775 --> 03:14:15.443
YOU BUT I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED

03:14:15.510 --> 03:14:17.278
THAT WE WENT THROUGH THAT ENTIRE

03:14:17.345 --> 03:14:19.547
PROCESS IN MOUNTAINS WERE MOVED.

03:14:19.614 --> 03:14:22.917

03:14:23.752 --> 03:14:26.388
WITH THAT. THAT ARE WE RETIRE WE

03:14:26.454 --> 03:14:28.623
ARE RISK OF LOSING CREDIBILITY

03:14:28.690 --> 03:14:30.959
WITH PARTNERS AS WE MOVE

03:14:31.026 --> 03:14:32.127
LEGISLATION- BY BUILDING

03:14:32.193 --> 03:14:34.229
COALITIONS AND THEN ONCE WE GET

03:14:34.295 --> 03:14:36.598

03:14:36.664 --> 03:14:41.002
THE APPLE. VISIT SHERIFF HER.

03:14:41.069 --> 03:14:42.604
ALTHOUGH I AM HUNGRY I DON'T

03:14:42.670 --> 03:14:44.172
THINK WE'RE TAKING TOO MANY

03:14:44.239 --> 03:14:49.911
BITES OF THE APPLE I IN. D.

03:14:49.978 --> 03:14:50.712
ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE HAS AN

03:14:50.779 --> 03:14:53.581
ENCOMPASSING DEFINITION OF WHAT

INDICATED MY- OPENING IS. REALLY

03:16:18.566 --> 03:16:20.502
IMPOSSIBLE TO RETRACT EVERY ONCE

03:16:20.568 --> 03:16:22.937

- MORE JUST ANYMORE NO I IN.

03:16:46.895 --> 03:16:48.897

ACROBATICS THAT WAS FUN- YEP BY

03:16:52.901 --> 03:16:55.436
I THINK MY THOUGHT MY FINAL

03:16:55.503 --> 03:16:58.072
POINT ON THAT SAME ISSUE IS THAT

03:16:58.139 --> 03:16:59.107
IT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

03:16:59.174 --> 03:17:00.408
THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL

03:17:00.475 --> 03:17:02.777
PROTECTIONS THAT WERE PUT IN

03:17:02.844 --> 03:17:04.512
PLACE AND NUMBER OF US ACTUALLY

03:17:04.579 --> 03:17:06.748
. WENT TO IRELAND AND NUMBER

YEARS BACK TO APPRECIATE HELLO

THE EUROPEANS WERE PUTTING FOR

03:17:10.552 --> 03:17:12.487
THEIR PRIVACY. LAWS IN THEIR

03:17:12.554 --> 03:17:15.089
PRACTICES- AND THAT BILL OF

03:17:15.156 --> 03:17:17.825
COURSE- HAD SUBSTANTIAL-

03:17:17.892 --> 03:17:19.227
SIMILARITIES TO THE EUROPEAN

03:17:19.294 --> 03:17:22.096
SYSTEM I THINK- IN GENERAL

03:17:22.163 --> 03:17:24.365
BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE- ON THAT

03:17:24.432 --> 03:17:27.068
ON THAT TRIP AS WELL. SO I THINK

03:17:27.135 --> 03:17:29.804
WHEN WE DO WE MOVE. A BILL LIKE

03:17:29.871 --> 03:17:32.473
THAT. THE PRIVACY ACT AND WE GET

03:17:32.540 --> 03:17:34.976

COOPERATION IN CONCESSIONS THERE

03:17:37.245 --> 03:17:40.215
NEEDS TO BE A DEGREE OF RESPECT

03:17:40.281 --> 03:17:42.250
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PROCESS. IN

03:17:42.317 --> 03:17:44.652
THAT INDIVIDUALS CANNOT COME IN

03:17:44.719 --> 03:17:47.121
IN THE END RELATIVE QUICK

03:17:47.188 --> 03:17:47.855
SUCCESSION INSTRUCTED HER

03:17:47.922 --> 03:17:49.490
ALTERING OR UNDERMINING IT OR

03:17:49.557 --> 03:17:52.460
TWEAKING IT IN WAYS THAT REALLY

03:17:52.527 --> 03:17:54.529
YOU KNOW KIND OF. UNDO THE

03:17:54.596 --> 03:17:56.231
GOODWILL THAT WAS DONE BEFORE

03:17:56.297 --> 03:17:58.533

BILL PURELY FOCUSED ON INTENT.

03:18:13.114 --> 03:18:14.349
IT WOULD DO LITTLE TO GUARD

03:18:14.415 --> 03:18:15.883
AGAINST SORT OF THIS BLANKET

03:18:15.950 --> 03:18:17.819

03:50:52.705 --> 03:50:56.275
COURTS AND YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T.

03:50:56.342 --> 03:50:58.477
CONFIRMED A WHOLE LOT BUT IT

03:50:58.544 --> 03:51:00.580
APPEARS THAT THAT MONEY IS NOT

03:51:00.646 --> 03:51:02.748
BEING USED NOT BEING SPENT THE

03:51:02.815 --> 03:51:05.551
WAY FOR THE WRONG REASONS- THAT

03:51:05.618 --> 03:51:09.021
WE NEEDED THEM SO I WOULD REALLY

03:51:09.088 --> 03:51:13.726
ASK TO- AMEND THIS SO WE COULD-

03:51:13.793 --> 03:51:16.028
EXTEND THE IT WE CAN EXTEND IT

03:51:16.095 --> 03:51:19.298
RATHER THAN HAVING IT-

03:51:19.365 --> 03:51:21.734
ELIMINATING THE SUNSET. AND THEN

03:51:21.801 --> 03:51:23.736
JUST MAKE SURE WE HAVE TO MAKE

03:51:23.803 --> 03:51:25.538
SURE THAT THIS THIRTY MILLION

03:51:25.605 --> 03:51:27.873
DOLLARS IS BEANS USE THE WAY

03:51:27.940 --> 03:51:31.844
THAT WE DECIDED. TO USE IT- SO

03:51:31.911 --> 03:51:34.780

SOMETHING NEAR TERM AND THEN

03:51:59.105 --> 03:52:01.040
ALSO THAT WASN'T RAISED IN THE

03:52:01.107 --> 03:52:02.475
DIRECT TESTIMONY HERE IN THE

FIFTEEN YEARS OF PRACTICE AND

03:52:37.743 --> 03:52:39.578
THE- TO MORE THAN A DECADE AGO

03:52:39.645 --> 03:52:43.816
SO I DID NOT- ACTUALLY PRACTICE-

03:52:43.883 --> 03:52:47.186
REMOTELY- THE IDEA PRACTICE OF

03:52:47.253 --> 03:52:50.389
DOING IT REMOTELY- DOES GIVE ME

03:52:50.456 --> 03:52:53.326
SOME TREPIDATION- AS AN ATTORNEY

03:52:53.392 --> 03:52:54.493

SUPPORTING IT- TODAY- AND I ALSO

03:53:11.210 --> 03:53:15.548
. JUSTIN IN TERMS OF. I THINK

03:53:15.614 --> 03:53:17.049
JUDGES SHOULD HAVE SUPER BROAD

03:53:17.116 --> 03:53:21.987
DISCRETION TO DISALLOW- TO

03:53:22.054 --> 03:53:24.357
DISALLOW REMOTE STATION- AND I

03:53:24.423 --> 03:53:26.559
KNOW THERE ARE A BUNCH OF

03:53:26.625 --> 03:53:27.626
DIFFERENT STANDARDS IN HERE BUT

03:53:27.693 --> 03:53:29.995
WHEN I JUDGE COUNTER COUNTS- BUT

03:53:30.062 --> 03:53:32.331
I JUST TO THINK THAT JUDGES ARE

03:53:32.398 --> 03:53:37.670
REALLY BROAD ABILITY- TO- TO

03:53:37.737 --> 03:53:40.673
REQUIRE. SUSPICION IN PERSON I

03:53:40.740 --> 03:53:43.242
DO LIKE HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY-

03:53:43.309 --> 03:53:44.844
AND AUTHORIZING CONTINUE

03:53:44.910 --> 03:53:48.914
FLEXIBILITY- BUT I COULD TO SEE-

03:53:48.981 --> 03:53:50.616
I COULD I COULD SEE SOME

03:53:50.683 --> 03:53:52.184
PROBLEMS ARISE IN THE LONG RUN I

03:53:52.251 --> 03:53:53.786
DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN COMMENT

03:53:53.853 --> 03:53:57.390

03:54:05.664 --> 03:54:06.999
TESTIMONY IN TERMS OF MULLIN I'M

03:54:07.066 --> 03:54:08.801
NOT SURE YOU CAN ELIMINATE A

03:54:08.868 --> 03:54:10.936
SUNSET ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT

03:54:11.003 --> 03:54:13.239
CURRENTLY IN LAW- BUT I DO

03:54:13.305 --> 03:54:18.043
THINK- OKAY PASSING MAKING IT.

03:54:18.110 --> 03:54:19.912
TAKING IT FROM AN EXECUTIVE

03:54:19.979 --> 03:54:24.183
ORDER TO OUR EMERGENCY ORDER TO-

03:54:24.250 --> 03:54:26.952
BEING APPROPRIATE TO BE USED IS

03:54:27.019 --> 03:54:28.754
- IS THE WAY TO GO BUT I DO WANT

03:54:28.821 --> 03:54:30.689
TO GRIEVE WITH US SENATOR WIENER

03:54:30.756 --> 03:54:33.292
ABOUT- GIVING DISCRETION TO

03:54:33.359 --> 03:54:35.261
JUDGES I DID PRACTICE LIKE I

03:54:35.327 --> 03:54:38.998
PRACTICED CRIMINAL DEFENSE WORK

03:54:39.064 --> 03:54:41.567
FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND- I HAD

03:54:41.634 --> 03:54:43.169
. MANY OF MY CLIENTS WERE

03:54:43.235 --> 03:54:44.670
MONOLINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKING SO

03:54:44.737 --> 03:54:46.372
WE HAD AN INTERPRETER AND WE HAD

03:54:46.439 --> 03:54:48.741
MULTIPLE INTERPRETERS DEPENDING

03:54:48.808 --> 03:54:51.377
ON HOW MANY- HOW MANY VICTIMS

03:54:51.444 --> 03:54:53.913
AND HOW MANY- DEFENDANTS THERE

03:54:53.979 --> 03:54:56.348
WERE AND THE THOUGHT OF TRYING

03:54:56.415 --> 03:54:58.584
TO DO THAT REMOTELY JUST. CHILLS

03:54:58.651 --> 03:55:00.719
ME TO THE BONE I WOULD WANT A

03:55:00.786 --> 03:55:02.888
JUDGE TO SAY NO WE UP WE ALL

03:55:02.955 --> 03:55:04.623
HAVE TO BE. PRESENT IN THE

03:55:04.690 --> 03:55:06.258
COURTROOM IN ORDER FOR THIS TO

03:55:06.325 --> 03:55:08.093
THIS KIND OF A CASE TO BE

03:55:08.160 --> 03:55:10.262
APPROPRIATELY RECORDED AND

03:55:10.329 --> 03:55:12.531
DOCUMENTED SO I WOULD LIKE THE

03:55:12.598 --> 03:55:13.766
JUDGES TO HAVE SOME DISCRETION

03:55:13.833 --> 03:55:15.768
SO IF YOU COULD IF YOU COULD

03:55:15.835 --> 03:55:18.370
ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE- WE- DO

03:55:18.437 --> 03:55:23.309
HAVE A MOTION. WE NEED A MOTION

03:55:23.375 --> 03:55:26.178
. THERE IS A MOTION A NEW THE

03:55:26.245 --> 03:55:28.614
MOTION IT WILL BE TO PASS- BUT

03:55:28.681 --> 03:55:30.049
WILL TAKE YOUR GEAR IN HER

03:55:30.115 --> 03:55:33.385
STATEMENT IN THE CONSIDER HM.

03:55:33.452 --> 03:55:36.121
RIGHT SO IT UP. AS I GO AROUND

03:55:36.188 --> 03:55:38.591
THE HORN HERE- I'M PROBABLY

03:55:38.657 --> 03:55:39.725
FORGOTTEN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS

03:55:39.792 --> 03:55:41.193
BUT AS TO THE QUESTION

03:55:41.260 --> 03:55:42.161
CONCERNING DISCRETION JUDGES

03:55:42.228 --> 03:55:44.129
HAVE ISCRETION THE AL MAKE IT

03:55:44.196 --> 03:55:45.531
EVEN CLEARER IN THE BILL BUT I

03:55:45.598 --> 03:55:47.800
BELIEVE IT IS CLEAR IN THE BILL

03:55:47.867 --> 03:55:48.934
BUT- TO. AVOID ANY DOUBT JUDGES

03:55:49.001 --> 03:55:51.437
HAVE DISCRETION TO BE ABLE TO

03:55:51.504 --> 03:55:53.038
REQUIRE WITNESSES TO BE PRESENT

03:55:53.105 --> 03:55:57.610
FOR EXAMPLE- IT IN TERMS OF. THE

03:55:57.676 --> 03:55:59.712
VERBATIM RECORD- AS WAS

03:55:59.778 --> 03:56:00.913
MENTIONED I THINK THERE'S BEEN

03:56:00.980 --> 03:56:03.382
THIS IS NOT STILL A BEGINNING OF

03:56:03.449 --> 03:56:04.717
AN EXPERIMENT WE'VE BEEN USING

03:56:04.783 --> 03:56:07.019
REMOTE ACCESS NOW. SINCE I

03:56:07.086 --> 03:56:08.621
BELIEVE THE BEGINNING OF TWO

03:56:08.687 --> 03:56:10.322
THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE- THE

03:56:10.389 --> 03:56:11.690
BILL IS IN LAW WE'RE NOT WE'RE

03:56:11.757 --> 03:56:13.626
NOT AMENDING A BILL IT'S NOT

03:56:13.692 --> 03:56:15.794
BECOME EFFECTIVE THE BILL AS OF

03:56:15.861 --> 03:56:16.462
JANUARY ONE OF TWO THOUSAND AND

03:56:16.529 --> 03:56:17.463
TWENTY TWO BECAME BECAME THE

03:56:17.530 --> 03:56:20.266
LAW. OF THE SIMPLY SONS THE BILL

03:56:20.332 --> 03:56:22.234
IS THAT EXIST TODAY SUNSETS AND

03:56:22.301 --> 03:56:24.370
IN MID. TWENTY TWENTY THREE

03:56:24.436 --> 03:56:26.338
WHICH CREATES THIS. WEIRD

03:56:26.405 --> 03:56:28.541
SITUATION WHERE IF THE BILL

03:56:28.607 --> 03:56:31.277
SUNSETS IN MID TWENTY TWENTY

03:56:31.343 --> 03:56:33.679
THREE. AND WE DON'T ACT THIS

03:56:33.746 --> 03:56:35.848
YEAR AND WE ACT NEXT YEAR

03:56:35.915 --> 03:56:37.349
THERE'S A SIX MONTH PERIOD WHERE

03:56:37.416 --> 03:56:40.152
WE GO BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN

03:56:40.219 --> 03:56:40.853
TWENTY. TWENTY OR TWENTY

03:56:40.920 --> 03:56:43.822
NINETEEN- THERE HAVE BEEN IS WAS

03:56:43.889 --> 03:56:45.624
TESTIFIED TO OVER A MILLION

03:56:45.691 --> 03:56:48.427
DIFFERENT- SETTINGS UP NO DOUBT

03:56:48.494 --> 03:56:50.829
THAT THERE'S EXCEPTIONS- I'M-

03:56:50.896 --> 03:56:52.264
SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY TRIED A

03:56:52.331 --> 03:56:54.633
JURY TRIAL- MID COVE IT LASTS

03:56:54.700 --> 03:56:57.503
ABOUT TWO AND HALF MONTHS AND WE

03:56:57.570 --> 03:56:58.771
USE REMOTE ACCESS IN MANY

03:56:58.837 --> 03:57:00.272
DIFFERENT FORMS. BOB IT'S NOT

03:57:00.339 --> 03:57:02.341
IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT'S MUCH

03:57:02.408 --> 03:57:03.208
BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE

03:57:03.275 --> 03:57:05.311
WHICH IS NOT HAVING A TRIAL. AND

03:57:05.377 --> 03:57:06.545
IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE

03:57:06.612 --> 03:57:08.681
ALTERNATIVE FOR THOSE WHO ARE

03:57:08.747 --> 03:57:10.215
INDIGENT BECAUSE REMOTE ACCESS

03:57:10.282 --> 03:57:11.817
PROVIDES FOR EXAMPLE FOR STATUS

03:57:11.884 --> 03:57:13.986
CONFERENCES. FOR IT CERTAINLY

03:57:14.053 --> 03:57:16.488
MINISTERIAL MATTERS THAT THEY

03:57:16.555 --> 03:57:17.890
CAN ACCESS THE COURT WITHOUT

03:57:17.957 --> 03:57:19.625
MISSING A DAY OF WORK THEY CAN

03:57:19.692 --> 03:57:21.060
ACCESS THE COURT FROM SOMEWHERE

03:57:21.126 --> 03:57:23.162
NEAR WHERE THEY LIVE GO TO LEGAL

03:57:23.228 --> 03:57:25.264
AID OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- AS

03:57:25.331 --> 03:57:26.398
OPPOSED TO HAVING COME TO COURT

03:57:26.465 --> 03:57:28.367
BUT IF THEY WANT TO COME TO

03:57:28.434 --> 03:57:29.635
COURT. THIS DOES NOT PREVENT

03:57:29.702 --> 03:57:34.740
THEM FROM COMING TO COURT- THE-

03:57:34.807 --> 03:57:36.008
CHALLENGE THAT WE- IS A

03:57:36.075 --> 03:57:38.110
CHALLENGE CONCERNING PROVIDING

03:57:38.177 --> 03:57:41.647
COURT REPORTERS. IN COURT ROOMS.

03:57:41.714 --> 03:57:44.049
TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO. ALL

03:57:44.116 --> 03:57:46.518
LITIGANTS TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL

03:57:46.585 --> 03:57:49.221
COURT REPORTER PRESENT AND ICOMPLETELY ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS

03:57:49.288 --> 03:57:51.357
WITH SENATOR ALSO WHEN SHE SAYS

03:57:51.423 --> 03:57:52.558
WHERE DID THAT THIRTY MILLION

03:57:52.625 --> 03:57:54.026
DOLLARS GO I DON'T KNOW WHERE

03:57:54.093 --> 03:57:55.327
THAT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS HAS

03:57:55.394 --> 03:57:57.296
GONE BUT WE CERTAINLY SHOULD

03:57:57.363 --> 03:57:58.497
FIND. OUT AND WE CERTAINLY

03:57:58.564 --> 03:58:00.899
SHOULD AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC

03:58:00.966 --> 03:58:02.134
POLICY DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE

03:58:02.201 --> 03:58:03.902
THAT THERE ARE COURT REPORTERS

03:58:03.969 --> 03:58:06.805
AVAILABLE- RIGHT NOW THERE'S A

03:58:06.872 --> 03:58:07.840
TREMENDOUS SHORTAGE OF COURT

03:58:07.906 --> 03:58:09.808
REPORTERS WHICH IS STYMIEING.

03:58:09.875 --> 03:58:12.444
AND IN FACT PROVIDES BASICALLY

03:58:12.511 --> 03:58:14.179
IT PROVIDES AN ADVANTAGE TO

03:58:14.246 --> 03:58:15.547
THOSE LITIGANTS THAT CAN'T

03:58:15.614 --> 03:58:17.349
AFFORD A REPORTER THEY CAN BE

03:58:17.416 --> 03:58:18.717
OUT. THEY CAN BE QUITE

03:58:18.784 --> 03:58:20.886
EXPENSIVE. I AGAIN ASSOCIATE

03:58:20.953 --> 03:58:24.223
MYSELF WITH THE MISS CASTRO IN

03:58:24.289 --> 03:58:27.159
HER COMMENTS. ABOUT TOM HOW WE

03:58:27.226 --> 03:58:31.497
HAVE- WE HAVE AN DURRETT. BUT

03:58:31.563 --> 03:58:33.132
WE'VE BEEN DOOR IN A SITUATION

03:58:33.198 --> 03:58:35.367
WHICH SORT OF CATCH AS CATCH CAN

03:58:35.434 --> 03:58:36.735
CONCERNING COURT REPORTERS IN

03:58:36.802 --> 03:58:38.404
TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT THE AYE I

03:58:38.470 --> 03:58:40.005
WASN'T PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENT AS

03:58:40.072 --> 03:58:43.909
TO AT THE SUNSET. SO I'M I'M NOT
