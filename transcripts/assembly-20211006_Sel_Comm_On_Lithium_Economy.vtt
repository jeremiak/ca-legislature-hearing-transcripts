00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:56.974
FROM WASTE ROCK- THE WASTE

00:32:57.041 --> 00:32:58.476
WATER PRODUCT FROM NINETY YEARS

00:32:58.543 --> 00:33:00.712
OF MINING OF OPERATION AT THIS

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.447
PARTICULAR SITE IN MY HOMETOWN.

00:33:02.513 --> 00:33:03.948
THE PLANT IS CURRENTLY

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:04.916
OPERATING AT FIVE METRIC TONS A

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.951
YEAR. WHICH IS ENOUGH TO

00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:07.685
PRODUCE BATTERIES FOR

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:10.288
APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY THOUSAND

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:12.757
ELECTRIC VEHICLES. HOWEVER THIS

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.192
PLANT HAS THE CAPACITY TO

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:15.426
DOUBLE THAT PRODUCTION

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:17.729
DETAINMENT METRIC TONS OF

00:33:17.795 --> 00:33:19.464
BATTERY GRADE LITHIUM A YEAR.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.632
WHICH WOULD POWER A HUNDRED AND

00:33:21.699 --> 00:33:22.133
FORTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.936
VEHICLES. I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:26.971
THAT THIS PLANT IN BORON IS

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:29.207
PRODUCING LITHIUM ENTIRELY FROM

00:33:29.273 --> 00:33:31.075
WASTE MATERIAL WHICH MEANS NO

00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:33.177
FURTHER MINING AS NECESSARY.

00:33:33.244 --> 00:33:34.946
THIS IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL OF

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:36.647
THIS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:33:36.714 --> 00:33:38.416
THE NATION AND THE REST OF THE

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:39.684
WORLD IS SERIOUS ABOUT CARBON

00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:42.854
REDUCTION. MY DISTRICT IS

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.123
ALREADY TAKEN THE INITIATIVE TO

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:45.723

MINDED AND MORE ON WHERE OF

00:35:22.453 --> 00:35:24.388
MINE TAILINGS ARE BEING PROCESS

00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:26.023
TO EXTRACT LITHIUM AND IT'S

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.025
ANOTHER EXCITING EXAMPLE OF

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:30.495
CALIFORNIA'S. LITHIUM OF

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:34.065
POTENTIAL AS AS WE CONSIDER THE

00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:35.800
LITHIUM ECONOMY EACH YEAR IN

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:38.903
CALIFORNIA- SO WHAT I'M GOING

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.973

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:43.975
TO RECOVER LITHIUM FROM

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:45.910
GEOTHERMAL BRINES AT THE SALTON

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:47.979
SEA AND HOW THAT DIFFERS FROM

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:49.413
SOME OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.683
WAYS OF PRODUCING LITHIUM SO

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.753
ON. MY WAY OF CONTEXT OF COURSE

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.221
CALIFORNIA'S A NATIONAL AND

INTERNATIONAL LEADER IN OUR

00:35:58.656 --> 00:35:59.590
RENEWABLE ENERGY CLIMATE AND

00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:01.359
CLIMATE GOALS THAT MAKES US A

00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:03.861
LEADER AND WE VERY MUCH ARE A

00:36:03.928 --> 00:36:06.030
LEADER IN DEPLOYING LITHIUM

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:08.199
BASED TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS-

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:09.534
ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT USE

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.636
LITHIUM ION BATTERIES AS WELL

00:36:11.702 --> 00:36:14.939
AS- LITHIUM BASED BATTERIES

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:16.641
THAT HELP SUPPORT OUR ELECTRIC

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:18.409
GRID DURING CRITICAL THAT PEAK

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:21.212
HOURS- WERE ALSO AT THE ENERGY

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:22.780
COMMISSION WE HAVE THE

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:26.017
PRIVILEGE OF HELPING SUPPORT-

00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:26.651
BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION A

00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:27.685
LITHIUM EXTRACTION IN

00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:30.655
CALIFORNIA AND- THAT'S BEEN. A

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:34.525
GREAT EFFORT TO- ASSESS

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:35.660
OPPORTUNITIES AND REALLY

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:38.062
EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES- FOR

00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:38.930
WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE

00:36:38.996 --> 00:36:41.699
SALT SEA REGION AS WELL AS

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:43.634
SUPPORTING COMMUNITY DIALOGUE

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:47.805
AND ENGAGEMENT- GLOBAL TRENDS

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.607
ARE VERY MUCH IN THE DIRECTION

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:51.943
OF RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN

00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:53.110
ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES THAT

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:55.413
REQUIRE LITHIUM BUT REALLY

00:36:55.479 --> 00:37:02.453
MASSIVE SCALES AND THIS.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.022
POSITIONS CALIFORNIA AND- SOME

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:07.725
SEE READ. TO BE LEADER IN A

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:11.596
CALL SUPPLY CHAIN- THAT CAN. I

00:37:11.662 --> 00:37:12.630
AM VERY INCLUDED FIRST

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:15.800
COMPONENT OF HOW. LITHIUM AND

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:19.837
ALSO RELATED INDUSTRIES THAT

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:22.206
TAKE ADVANTAGE URBAN USE THAT

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:24.375
UTILIZE THE LITHIUM AND THE

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:27.078
CLEAN ENERGY THAT WE HAVE IN

00:37:27.144 --> 00:37:31.182
ABUNDANCE IN THE STATE. SO- THE

00:37:31.248 --> 00:37:33.517
DEAL THERMAL BRIAN'S ON THAT

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:35.987
ARE ABOUT A HALF MILE BENEATH

00:37:36.053 --> 00:37:39.523
THE SALTON SEA HAVE PROBABLY

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.958
WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT CERTAINLY

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:42.727
CURRENTLY BELIEVED TO BE THE

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:44.729
HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:47.198
LITHIUM CONTAINEDIN GEOTHERMAL

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:49.367
BRINES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:51.268
AND RECOVERING LITHIUM FROM

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:53.037
THOSE BRIAN'S IS FUNDAMENTALLY

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:54.939
A VERY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

00:37:55.006 --> 00:37:58.509
PROCESS DONE THE WAY LITHIUM IS

00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:01.679
CURRENTLY- MIND SO WELL THE TWO

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:02.747
WAYS A LITHIUM IS CURRENTLY

00:38:02.813 --> 00:38:04.682
EXTRACTED RIGHT NOW. INCLUDE

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:06.884
HARD ROCK MINING AND THAT

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.419
FOLLOWS THE TRADITIONAL MINING

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:10.321
PROCESS WHERE HEAVY EQUIPMENT

00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:12.990
IS USED TO REMOVE SOIL FIND

00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:14.392
LIST AND FIND WITHIN RICH

00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:18.062
DEPOSITS WITHIN HARD ROCK-

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:20.898
THOSE DEPOSITS ARE EXTRACTED

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:24.368
AND THEN THERE'S A CHEMICAL.

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:27.905
PROCESSING THAT'S DONE TO GET

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:30.374
THE LITHIUM OUT OF THOSE HARD

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:32.777
ROCK DEPOSITS ON THE MINING IS

00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:35.813
ENVIRONMENTALLY- IMPACTFUL

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.349
OBVIOUSLY IN THAT IT CAN SCAR A

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:39.984
LANDSCAPES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT

00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:42.153
ECOSYSTEMS AND HABITAT. IT'S

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:43.654
ALSO WATER AND ENERGY

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:47.158
INTENSIVE. IN CONTRAST TO THE

00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:50.161
PROCESS AND THE OPPORTUNITY AT

00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:52.363
THE SALTON SEA WHERE LITHIUM

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.132
RECOVERY CAN LITERALLY BE ANY

00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:58.469
COPRODUCT OF CLEAN ENERGY

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:02.039
PRODUCTION- THE HARD ROCK ALL

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:05.576
RIGHT SO THE OTHER MAJOR OUR

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:07.478
METHOD FOR PRODUCING LITHIUM

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:10.314
TODAY. IS THE OF THE OPERATIVE

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:12.650
BRIAN PROCESSES USED X.

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:15.186
EXTENSIVELY IN PARTS OF SOUTH

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:18.222
AMERICA AND THIS PROCESS

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:21.258
INVOLVES PUMPING HIM BRIAN.

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:24.261
UNDERGROUND SURFACE POOLS

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:25.996
MIXING INTERLOCAL THAT HELP

00:39:26.063 --> 00:39:27.531
SEPARATE OUT THE NON LITHIUM

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:30.334
CONSTITUENTS LETTING THEM STAY

00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:31.268
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAT CAN

00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:34.538
EXTEND FROM MONTHS TO YEARS. TO

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:39.543
EVAPORATE AND- TAKING EXPOSED

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:42.913
WITH. THE M. FOR FURTHER

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:43.714
PROCESSING SO. THIS PROCESS IS

00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:47.918
IN- IT'S YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:50.421
WATER INTENSIVE IN A DESERT

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:52.690
REGIONS SO IT IT'S GOT

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:54.825
SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL AND

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:57.194
HUMAN IMPACTS IN MANY PLACES

00:39:57.261 --> 00:39:58.929
WHERE- WHERE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS

00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:02.199
WIDESPREAD. AND IT CAN REQUIRE-

00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:03.901
THOUSANDS OF SQUARE MILES OF

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:07.938
LAND. SO IN CONTRAST TO THESE

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:10.007
TWO TECHNOLOGIES DIRECTOR

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:12.977
LITHIUM RECOVERY ALLOWS FOR A

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:15.179
VERY VERY SUSTAINABLE LITHIUM

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:17.782
SUPPLY. IT'S THE PROCESS OF

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:19.784
REMOVING LITHIUM FROM

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.920
GEOTHERMAL BRINE. ARE TYPICALLY

00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:24.355
USING AN ENGINEERED MATERIAL

00:40:24.421 --> 00:40:27.057
SURFACES THAT THE LITHIUM ION

00:40:27.124 --> 00:40:29.960
IN THE BRINE IS ATTRACTED TO

00:40:30.027 --> 00:40:33.164
AND STICKS TO SO BASICALLY THE

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.733
GEOTHERMAL BRINE IS BROADER FOR

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.536
WELLS IT'S USED TO GENERATE

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:40.371
ELECTRICITY THE VERY HOT BRINE

00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:42.139
IS USED TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:44.375
GEOTHERMAL PLANTS. AND THEN IT

00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:49.580
WOULD BE FURTHER PROCESS TO-

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:51.515
GET THE LITHIUM OUT OF THE

THESE ARE TRUCKS CLEARLY THE

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:28.685
FIRST ONE OF THEM IS ENERGIES.

00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:31.855
STEVEN WILL TALK THAT A SMALL-

00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:33.757

PROGRESS THAT. NOW BACK IN TWO.

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:44.935
AND SOME SHORT WAS STILL IN THE

EARLY STAGES- IT WAS VERY CLEAR

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:50.274
THAT THIS IS GOING TO WORK- I

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.808
WAS PUSHING STEVEN CHOI DID WE

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:53.010
SHOULD BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:55.279
IN TERMS OF THE METRICS THAT WE

00:46:55.345 --> 00:46:58.515
WERE USING. IT WAS ALSO A- THE

00:46:58.582 --> 00:46:59.716
ONE THING THAT COULD LOOK AT

00:46:59.783 --> 00:47:01.785
SOLAR OR WIND FOR THAT MATTER.

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:03.387
IS THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:05.322
LOW COST- RIDGE IN THOSE DAYS

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:07.024
BATTERIES WERE ABOUT THREE

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.058
HUNDRED DOLLARS A KILOWATT

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.127
HOUR. AN HOUR CALCULATIONS WERE

00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:11.562
TELLING US THAT WE NEEDED TO

00:47:11.628 --> 00:47:12.663
GET TO ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS A

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:15.599
CAN OF. COURSE NOW WITH TESLA'S

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:17.668
BOB THE PRODUCT WE NOW HAVE THE

00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:19.970
POSSIBILITY OF GETTING TO ONE

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:20.837
HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A

00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:22.039
KILOWATT HOUR BUT WE NEEDED TO

00:47:22.105 --> 00:47:27.811
GET THE THIRTY DOLLARS HELLO.

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:29.546
SO IT WAS VERY CLEAR THE

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:33.283
REVENUE. ARE TO BE STRONG GET.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:34.384

MY BATTERIES I SHOULD SAY THAT

00:47:46.463 --> 00:47:47.097
AT MY BROTHERS WERE INVENTED

DOLLARS INVESTING IN GEOTHERMAL

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.485
THERE IS NO BROADBAND AND SO

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.853
THAT'S A MAJOR NEED FOR US TO

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.421
BRING BROADBAND INTO THAT AREA

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:09.492

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.372
ENTIRE COUNTY IS A FOREIGN

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.541
TRADE ZONE. WHICH MEANS THAT WE

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.443
CAN NOT ONLY IMPORT BUT WE CAN

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.578

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:18.861
LIMITATIONS BUT I THINK THAT'S

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:19.862
SOMETHING THAT THAT COULD BE

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:21.831
WORKED ON AS AN EXAMPLE THERE'S

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:23.399
A CAP ON FUNDING FOR TEN

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.901
MILLION DOLLARS. MOST THE

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.169

DOLLARS AND IMPERIAL COUNTY IS

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:33.643
A LOT OF THE LOCATION WHEN WE

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:35.178

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:36.445
RECYCLE THOSE MATERIALS AND

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:37.513
TURN THEM INTO OTHER OTHER

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.015

BUSINESSES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:52.094
THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.729
COMING OUR WAY. IMPERIAL COUNTY

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:54.830
IS AN IDEAL PLACE TO CAPTURE

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:58.201
THE ENTIRE SITE SUPPLY CHAIN-

01:03:58.267 --> 01:04:00.536
OF THIS INDUSTRY THAT IS BEFORE

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.638
US BUT WE REALLY NEED TO STAY

01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:05.107
AHEAD OF THE CURVE. AND THE WAY

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.842
THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT IS WITH

SOME THINGS I JUST MENTIONED BE

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:10.713
PREPARED AND WORKING ON ALL

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.314

COMMITTED TO BUILDING A PILOT

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:18.988
PROJECT. IN A COMMERCIAL

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.623
PROJECT WILL BE SCALABLE FOR

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.925
THE FUTURE. ENERGY SOURCE JUST

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:23.960
RECEIVED THEIR PERMITS LAST

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:26.395
WEEK. I FOR THEIR LITHIUM

01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:26.996
EXTRACTIONS WERE VERY EXCITED

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:28.998
ABOUT THAT. CONTROLLED THERMAL

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:30.800
RESOURCES NEW COMPANY IS

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:32.501
LOOKING AT BUILDING. ITS FIRST

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:33.869
PHASE NINETY FIVE MEGAWATT

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:35.338
GEOTHERMAL PLANT WHICH WILL BE

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.706
ABLE TO PROVIDE THE INNER CITY

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:39.609
AND THE MINERALS THAT CAN BE

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:40.743
EXTRACTED FOR THIS INDUSTRY.

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:41.377
ALL THESE CUTS ALL THESE

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:42.745
BUSINESSES AND THE OTHERS THAT

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.513
WERE WORKING WITH. ARE VERY

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.148
CAREFUL NOT TO OVER PROMISE AND

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:49.652
UNDER DELIVER. A REALISTICALLY

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:50.186
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS HE

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:51.387
TARGET DATE THAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:53.089
LOOKING AT IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:54.957
WAY OFF. BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:56.092
GOING TO TAKE IN ORDER TO

01:04:56.158 --> 01:05:00.396
PERMIT. CONSTRUCT AND- FINANCE.

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.064
INDUSTRIES FINANCING IS THE KEY

01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:04.900
HERE AND SO AS WE'VE BEEN

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:06.102
MOVING ALONG WITH THESE

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:08.404
COMPANIES FOR MANY YEARS IT'S

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:09.472
PROVING A DE RISKING THE

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:11.440
INDUSTRY SO THAT WE CAN ATTRACT

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.643
THE FINANCING. ADDUCTION TAX

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:14.877
CREDITS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:17.013
FEDERAL PROGRAM WHICH WAS DOES

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:19.115
NOT BENEFIT GEOTHERMAL ENERGY.

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:20.016
TAKES EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO BUILD

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:21.350
A GEOTHERMAL PLANT PRODUCTION

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:23.486
TAX CREDITS THE DION AFFECT

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:24.453
TWELVE MONTHS AFTER YOU BREAK

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.822
GROUND. THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF

01:05:26.889 --> 01:05:29.659
HOW A CERTAIN CERTAIN PROGRAMS

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:30.860
DO NOT BENEFIT THIS INDUSTRY

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:32.194
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:32.962
CALIFORNIA WE COULD WORK ON

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:34.530
THAT TOGETHER. WE'VE BEEN VERY

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.666
SUCCESSFUL BUT WITH THE DARK

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:38.434
CAL COMPETES PROGRAM FOR THESE

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.469
BUSINESSES AND IMPERIAL COUNTY-

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:43.072
CHALLENGES THERE IS THAT- YOU

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.173
HAVE TO HAVE EXTERNAL

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.708
COMPETITION FROM OTHER STATES

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.510
AN ORDINANCE THAT. AND SO

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:49.145
THERE'S A FOCUS ON THE LITHIUM

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.913
INDUSTRY THEN I THINK THAT'S

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:51.547
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BENEFIT US

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:53.683
LOCALLY- THE REASON FOR THAT

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:55.217
IS. BECAUSE THIS GENTLEMAN

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:56.986
ANOMALY IS ONLY INDIAN GIRL

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:59.155
COUNTY. THERE'S NO PLACE IN IN

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:00.923
THE UNITED STATES THAT HAS THIS

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:02.858
RESOURCE AT THE VOLUME THAT WE

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:05.795
HAVE. IN ADDITION TO THAT IT

01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:08.631
THIS INDUSTRY REQUIRES A LOT OF

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:10.533
WATER AND A LOT OF ENERGY. OUR

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:11.967
POTENTIAL FOR GEOTHERMAL ENERGY

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:14.036
IN THE GIRL COUNTY IS PROBABLY

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.871
ONLY ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. AND

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:16.939
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.374
TO EXPAND THAT AS WE EXPAND THE

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:19.842
JEWS THE GEOTHERMAL POWER

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:20.943
PLANTS WERE ALSO SPENT

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.012
EXPANDING. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:24.246
THE EXTRACTION OF THE MIRROR OF

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.948
THE MINERALS SO THEREFORE WILL

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:28.250
BUILD PRODUCE THE POWER IN THE

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:33.522
MINERALS AT THE SAME TIME.

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:34.090
THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:34.690
THAT YOU LOOK AT. IF YOU THINK

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:36.359
ABOUT AND- IN THIS OF. ARE THEY

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:37.727
ARE CHALLENGE THEIR ON THE BACK

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:38.861
AND THEN AND NOT ON THE FRONT

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:41.464
END. AND MY OPINION IS THAT

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.598
INCENTIVES DON'T MAKE ABOUT POP

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.033
OBJECT GOOD TO MAKE A GOOD

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.135
PROJECT GREAT. AND THAT'S WHERE

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:47.236
WE NEED HELP WITH A COUPLE OF

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:48.371
THESE PROGRAMS. WHAT'S THE

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:49.972
NUMBER ONE CENTER WE CAN HAVE

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:51.807
WORKFORCE. RIGHT IS THERE A WAY

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:53.409
THAT WE CAN DEVELOP PROGRAMS

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:54.944
THAT ARE THESE INDUSTRIES HIRE

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.845
LOCAL PEOPLE AND TRAIN LOCAL

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:57.480
PEOPLE. THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:58.981
THE FUNDING TO DO THAT THEN

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:00.783
THAT WOULD BE. HUGE WE'RE

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:01.884
LOOKING AT AN INDUSTRY THAT'S A

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:03.586
GAME CHANGER FOR COUNTY COUNTY

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:06.188
THAT HAS. A HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:07.223
SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. I WE

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:10.259
HAVE- THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:12.128
WE HAVE PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:13.396
TO TRY TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:14.830
OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR COUNTY AND

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:16.565
RETAIN OUR WORK FORCE. AND THIS

01:07:16.632 --> 01:07:17.900
IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:20.302
THAT. SO WITH BUT LOOKING AT

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:21.904
THAT WE CAN'T MAKE THE MISTAKE

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:23.205
THAT WE MADE WITH SOLAR. WHICH

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:26.609
IS REQUIRED THAT WE HAVE SOLAR

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:27.243
IN THE IN THE STATE OF.

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:28.677
CALIFORNIA AND THAT WE DON'T

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:30.079
CREATE THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:32.181
INCENTIVES. TO BE ABLE TO. A

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:35.217
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:36.652
THINGS THAT THE WORK TO BE DONE

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.354
TO MAKE US COMPETITIVE. AND TO

ATTRACT INDUSTRIES. ANOTHER

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:41.257
THING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:43.092
SHOULD BE PUSHING PUSHING FOR.

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:45.060
IS TO CHANGE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:47.596
ZONES. I WHICH IS A MECHANISM.

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:49.532
THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES ARE NOT

NOT ONLY HAVE BEEN PROVED OUT

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:57.766
BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE NEW

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.935
TERRITORY. ALL OF THIS IS

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:01.803

THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS IS

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:12.948
JUST A MORAL- TRAGEDY THAT

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:14.116
WE'VE LET IT GET THIS FAR

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:16.284
WITHOUT RESPONDING. AND AS BILL

CLINTON USED TO SAY NEVER LET A

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:20.455
GOOD CRISIS GO TO WASTE SO HERE

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:22.657
WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUGE

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:24.292
JOB TURN WHERE THE STATE OF

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:26.495
CALIFORNIA HAS HUGE RESERVES-

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:29.231
THE ECONOMICS OF KOBE ED. ARE

TESLA. WITHOUT A CARD. THERE

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:16.545

DOLLARS THAT WILL BE NECESSARY

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:31.446
TO DEVELOP WHAT WE KNOW IS THE

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:33.181
FOURTH LARGEST RESERVE OF

01:22:33.248 --> 01:22:35.250
LITHIUM ON PLANET EARTH. AND IS

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:37.252
CARRYING IT MENTIONED EARLIER

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.888
IT IS A MORE SUSTAINABLY

01:22:39.954 --> 01:22:41.856
DEVELOP A BALL SOURCE OF

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:43.525
LITHIUM THAN ANY PLACE ON EARTH

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:45.827
AS WELL ALL AND BY THE WAY THE

01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:47.929
BEST WAY TO ACCESS IT IS THE

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:50.031
INCREASED MORE RENEWABLE POWER.

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:52.000
BY CREATING MORE GEO THERMAL

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:54.402
ENERGY WHICH- BY THE WAY THE

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:55.937
STATE OF CALIFORNIA JUST PUT

STORAGE SO THERE'S ANOTHER BOOK

01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:16.725
AND THAT HELPS TO CREATE THE

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:18.460
ECONOMIC FLOOR THAT IS

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:20.729
NECESSARY. FOR THE ATTRACTION

INTO THIS GAME. AND I'LL JUST

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:27.669
CLOSES BY STATING THAT THE

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:29.804

AB THREE NINETY EIGHT A FEW

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.185
YEARS AGO AND THE PURPOSE OF

NEUTRAL ECONOMY. AND SO I WANT

TO USE WHAT WE LEARNED IN THAT

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:17.332
PLAN AND IN THAT RESEARCH TOOK

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:21.569
TO RELATE IT HERE- TO THIS.

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:23.938

YOU KNOW OF OUR COMMUNITY BUT

01:27:35.883 --> 01:27:37.251
IT IT REALLY IS AN EFFORT TO

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:38.720
PUT THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER

01:27:38.786 --> 01:27:41.322
AND USE GOVERNMENT RESOURCES-

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:43.558

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:46.628
BUILD UP A FULL INDUSTRY THAT-

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:48.696
THAT CAN NOT ONLY HELP MEET OUR

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:50.698

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:59.273
INEQUITIES THAT WE SEE AND THAT

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.142
ARE PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:04.278
PLACES LIKE PM IMPERIAL VALLEY

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:06.114
AND THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT AT

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:09.050
EACH STAGE OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:10.685

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.355
BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:16.991
INVESTMENT AND THOSE JOBS SOME

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:18.259
OF THEM ARE PROFESSIONAL AND WE

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:21.062
CAN TAP INTO ARE WONDERFUL YOU

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:23.564
SEE AND STATE AND COMMUNITY

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:26.100
COLLEGE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUILD

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:27.368
THE TECHNICAL SKILLS THAT ARE

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:30.505
NEEDED AND A LOT OF THEM ARE.

01:28:30.571 --> 01:28:33.074
BLUE COLLAR WORKERS WHO- YOU

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:37.145

01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:40.014
AND BENEFITS- BUT IN OUR

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:42.250
ECONOMY ARE OFTEN PART OF ARE

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:44.419
REALLY TERRIBLE TREND OF THE

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:48.356
GROWTH OF LOW WAGE JOBS. AND

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:50.825
BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG. EFFORT

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:53.661
OF PUBLIC PRIVATE AND- YOU KNOW

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:55.730
INTENSE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:57.632
TO BUILD THE SUPPLY CHAIN WE

01:28:57.699 --> 01:29:00.401
CAN INFLUENCE WHETHER OR NOT.

01:29:00.468 --> 01:29:02.704
THE A NONPROFESSIONAL JOBS ARE

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.439
GOOD JOBS WITH FAMILY

01:29:04.505 --> 01:29:07.241
SUPPORTING WAGES AND BENEFITS

01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:08.142
YOU KNOW IT REALLY USED TO BE

01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:09.844
THAT IN PLACES LIKE IMPERIAL

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:13.014
VALLEY WE TENDED TO SAY ANY JOB

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.883
IS BETTER THAN NO JOB- BUT

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:17.118
WE'VE LEARNED THAT LOW WAGE

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:19.187
JOBS ARE PROBLEM FOR FAMILIES

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:21.155
COMMUNITIES AND ALL LEVELS OF

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:24.826
GOVERNMENT- SO I THINK. WE SEE

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:27.829
WE DO ALSO HAVE THIS UNIQUE

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:30.998
OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE TO

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:33.234
EFFORTS OF CREATING A GOOD JOBS

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.737
ECONOMY. AND BUILDING A NEW

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:38.072
INDUSTRY THAT IS CLEAN AND

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:41.109
HELPS US MEET OUR THAT THE- IN

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:43.478
ON THE EXISTENTIAL CRISIS THAT

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:46.247
WE'RE FACING WITH CLIMATE AND-

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:49.250
WE HAVE TO DO THAT

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:52.653
INTENTIONALLY- AND- WE HAVE THE

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.624
TOOLS NOW TO LOOK AT WHICH

01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:58.259

01:29:58.326 --> 01:30:00.528
GENERATING JOBS AND WHETHER OR

01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:03.765
NOT WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:05.600
POSSIBILITY THAT THESE COULD BE

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:08.035
LOW WAGE JOBS AND THEN LOOK AT

01:30:08.102 --> 01:30:09.871
THE SPECIFIC TOOLS THAT WE

01:30:09.937 --> 01:30:12.640
HAVE. THAT CAN COMPLEMENT THE

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:14.342
OTHER GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:17.311
PROGRAMMES AND MANDATES AND

01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:20.148
PERMITTING PROCESSES- THAT CAN

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:23.117
BE USED TO ENTICE THE BETTER

EMPLOYERS TO HOLD THE EMPLOYERS

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:27.922
THAT ARE INVESTING TO THEIR

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:29.891
BEST BEHAVIOR BECAUSE OFTEN

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:31.726
THEY HAVE BETTER BEHAVIOR IN

01:30:31.793 --> 01:30:33.327
PLACES LIKE EUROPE THAN THEY

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:35.663
MIGHT IN THE U. S. BECAUSE

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:37.098
EUROPE HOLDS THEM TO BETTER

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:40.168
STANDARDS AND REALLY- BUILD

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:43.104
WHAT WE CALL THE HIGH ROAD AND-

JOBS WHICH ARE GOING TO BE

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.576
REALLY IMPORTANT AND DANNY'S%

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:50.978
GONNA TALK TALK ABOUT- YOU KNOW

01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:53.014
BUILDING PROCESSING FACILITIES

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.949
BUILDING MARTILLO THERMAL

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:57.485

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:03.891
AT TRIED AND TRUE METHODS

THROUGH- PROJECT LABOR

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.429
AGREEMENTS TO TAPPING INTO ARE

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:10.598
INCREDIBLY VALUABLE

01:31:10.665 --> 01:31:13.167
APPRENTICESHIP- SYSTEM IN

01:31:13.234 --> 01:31:14.969
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE GOLD

01:31:15.036 --> 01:31:16.270
STANDARD OF TRAINING FOR

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:20.374
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS- WE HAVE.

01:31:20.441 --> 01:31:22.510
WAYS ENSURE THAT WE TAKE THE

01:31:22.577 --> 01:31:25.146
HIGH ROAD IN CONSTRUCTION AND I

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:26.814
I'M I'M NOT GONNA STEAL DANTES

01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:28.349
THUNDER BECAUSE I THINK HE WILL

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:29.851
BE VERY ARTICULATE AND TALKING

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:31.652
ABOUT WHAT THE SPECIFIC TOOLS

01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:33.721
ARE AND WHAT THEIR- WHAT THE

01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:35.656
BENEFITS OF GOING THE HIGH ROAD

01:31:35.723 --> 01:31:37.992
ARE IN IMPERIAL VALLEY. IN

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:39.160
ADDITION TO CONSTRUCTION

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:41.229
THERE'S ALSO GONNA BE A LOT OF

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:45.266
OTHER JOBS- AND I THINK WE CAN.

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:47.068
LOOK AT OUR POLICIES AND

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:48.903
PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:50.471
THERE ARE LABOR STANDARDS THAT

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:52.840
WE DO ENTICE THEM THE BEST

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:54.609
EMPLOYERS AND ENTICE EMPLOYERS

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:58.479
TO BE THEIR BEST- AND- THAT'S

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:02.783
NOT ALWAYS- A COMMON SET OF

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:05.686
KNOWLEDGE OR OR OR TECHNICAL

01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:08.456
ASSISTANCE. WITHIN THAT THE

01:32:08.522 --> 01:32:12.426
TYPES OF- AGENCIES AND LEADERS

01:32:12.493 --> 01:32:16.397
WHO ARE. INVOLVED IN IN LANDING

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:19.000
THE SCHOOL SUPPLY CHAIN- BUT I

01:48:14.287 --> 01:48:15.922
THAT THERE'S ENOUGH R. AND D.

01:48:15.989 --> 01:48:17.958
MONEY FOR DIFFERENT AREAS IN

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:20.393
THE STATE OF LITHIUM IS FOUND.

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:21.761
THAT IT THAT THAT EVERYBODY

01:48:21.828 --> 01:48:22.996
GETS THEIR FAIR SHARE WE JUST

01:48:23.063 --> 01:48:24.297
DON'T CONCENTRATE NECESSARILY

01:48:24.364 --> 01:48:27.100
INSULTS YOU KNOW DON'T TAKE

01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:27.601
NOTHING FROM HEADWATERS

01:48:27.667 --> 01:48:28.802
DISTRICT. BUT AS A LINES GET

LACKEYS DISTRICTS ABOUT THREE

01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:35.342
MILES WEST OF MY DISTRICT SO IF

01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:36.643
THE LINES MOVE JUST A LITTLE

01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:38.278
BIT IT MIGHT BE IN MY DISTRICT.

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:40.413
IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. BUT BUT

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:41.681
JUST KIND OF KEEP THAT IN

01:48:41.748 --> 01:48:43.950
PERSPECTIVE THAT WE DON'T JUST

01:48:44.017 --> 01:48:46.553
ZERO IN ON ONE SECTOR IN

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:47.120

CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE- FOR. THE

01:49:49.482 --> 01:49:51.117
PURPOSE OF. AGAIN BEING A

01:49:51.184 --> 01:49:55.155
LEADER- IN THIS- AREA OF- CLEAN

CLIMATE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES-

01:49:58.892 --> 01:50:03.463
BUT. QUESTION MISTER LOOKED AS-

01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:06.499
A RESERVE. I DO A QUESTION FOR

01:50:06.566 --> 01:50:09.002
DOCTOR- WE SEE THE BUILD OUT

01:50:09.069 --> 01:50:12.872
OF- SOLAR- FROM THE BEGINNING

01:50:12.939 --> 01:50:14.574
TO THE PRESENT TIME. WHAT ARE

01:50:14.641 --> 01:50:16.343
SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED IN

01:50:16.409 --> 01:50:18.945
TERMS OF- PROGRAMS INCENTIVES

01:50:19.012 --> 01:50:21.514
APPROACHES. THAT YOU CAN KIND

01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:22.816
OF TOUCH ON THAT COULD

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:24.017
POTENTIALLY BE APPLICABLES

01:50:24.084 --> 01:50:25.819
HERE- THAT WITH THIS-

01:50:25.885 --> 01:50:28.188
DISCUSSION ON LITHIUM RECOVERY

01:50:28.254 --> 01:50:30.490
AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. YEAH

01:50:30.557 --> 01:50:31.891
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION BUT

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:34.594
WHEN WE STARTED SON SHOT IN TWO

01:50:34.661 --> 01:50:36.629
THOUSAND ELEVEN. WE TOOK ALL OF

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:38.031
THE GOVERNMENT APPROACH WHICH

01:50:38.098 --> 01:50:40.333
WHICH MEANS WE SAID THAT WE ALL

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.568
SORT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:43.370
UNITED STATES AND WE WANT THEM

01:50:43.436 --> 01:50:45.005
TO BE SUCCESSFUL GET THE

01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:46.806
BENEFITS OF THE TAX CREATED BY

01:50:46.873 --> 01:50:48.608
US BUT- SO IF YOU SOME CHART

01:50:48.675 --> 01:50:50.343
WHEN I WAS THERE ARE ALSO PART

01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:52.812
OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

01:50:52.879 --> 01:50:53.847
DOLLAR. TO YOUR PROGRAM.

01:50:53.913 --> 01:50:55.315
OXIMETRY THE ORDER OF MANY OF

01:50:55.382 --> 01:50:57.083
THE PROGRAMS THAT WITHIN. THE

01:50:57.150 --> 01:50:59.652
APPLIED PARTS OF DEAL WEEKS SO

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:01.988
WITH THAT WE HAD FUNDING

01:51:02.055 --> 01:51:04.190
OPPORTUNITIES AND THE YOUR I

01:51:04.257 --> 01:51:05.558
WAS THAT BIG TO YOURS I WAS

01:51:05.625 --> 01:51:08.161
THAT WE DONE ABOUT. TWENTY TO

01:51:08.228 --> 01:51:08.728
TWENTY TWO DIFFERENT FUNDING

01:51:08.795 --> 01:51:11.064
OPPORTUNITIES. SOME OF THEM

01:51:11.131 --> 01:51:11.831
WERE OF THE SCALE OF THE

01:51:11.898 --> 01:51:13.299
MILLION DOLLARS R. D.

01:51:13.366 --> 01:51:15.168
OPPORTUNITY. AND SOME OF THEM

01:51:15.235 --> 01:51:16.736
WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO A FIFTY

01:51:16.803 --> 01:51:17.937
MILLION DOLLAR OPPORTUNITY

01:51:18.004 --> 01:51:19.305
WHICH IS VERY MUCH FOCUS ON

01:51:19.372 --> 01:51:21.241
MANUFACTURING. MANY OF THEM

01:51:21.307 --> 01:51:23.109
HAVE COST SHARE REQUIREMENTS

01:51:23.176 --> 01:51:25.712
TYPICALLY. ONE TO ONE OR TWO TO

01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:27.113
ONE COST SHARE REQUIREMENTS

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.715
BECAUSE WE WANT THE PRIVATE

01:51:28.782 --> 01:51:29.783
SECTOR. TO HAVE A SKIN IN THE

01:51:29.849 --> 01:51:31.284
GAME. AND WE WERE TRYING TO

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:33.420
OVERTLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT

01:51:33.486 --> 01:51:35.522
LEVERAGE WHICH MEANS IF THE

01:51:35.588 --> 01:51:36.222
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS A

01:51:36.289 --> 01:51:38.258
DOLLAR IN. THAT YOU GET THREE

01:51:38.324 --> 01:51:39.926
DOLLARS WORTH OF BENEFIT BY

01:51:39.993 --> 01:51:42.062
LEVERAGING NOT ONLY THE PRIVATE

01:51:42.128 --> 01:51:43.797
SECTOR BUT IN THE CASE OF

01:51:43.863 --> 01:51:45.732
CALIFORNIA I KNOW. KAREN AND

01:51:45.799 --> 01:51:47.100
DAVID HOCHSCHILD AND BEFORE

01:51:47.167 --> 01:51:49.402
THAT BOB. AND THEY'VE BEEN

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:51.471
FANTASTIC INSTANCE YOU SEE A CO

01:51:51.538 --> 01:51:53.073
INVESTING IN MANY THINGS. SO

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:54.607
THAT YOU CAN BIGGER BENEFIT

01:51:54.674 --> 01:51:56.743
FROM THE FEDERAL INVESTMENT.

01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:58.378
BUT THE UPPER END OF IT I THINK

01:51:58.445 --> 01:52:00.246
STEVEN TALK ABOUT IT. WE HAD

01:52:00.313 --> 01:52:01.381
THE LOAN GUARANTEE WE STILL

01:52:01.448 --> 01:52:02.215
HAVE THE LOAN GUARANTEE

01:52:02.282 --> 01:52:03.983
PROGRAM. THE LOAN GUARANTEE

01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:05.652
PROGRAM IS IN SOME SENSE OF IN

01:52:05.718 --> 01:52:07.954
SIMPLE TERMS. IT'S A DELISTING

01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:09.522
PROGRAM FOR VERY RISKY

01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:11.458
PROJECTS. ESPECIALLY IN THE

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:12.492
MANUFACTURING OF NEW

01:52:12.559 --> 01:52:14.894
TECHNOLOGIES. THAT IS PERHAPS

01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:16.563
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART IN THE

01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:18.331
WHOLE ECOSYSTEM. AND THEREFORE

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:20.433
WE HAD WE I DID A LOT OF

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.135
DILIGENCE AND THE LOAN

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:24.404
GUARANTEE PROGRAMS- IN TERMS OF

01:52:24.471 --> 01:52:31.878
HELPING COMPANIES- GO FORWARD

01:52:31.945 --> 01:52:32.712
WITH THE PROPOSAL'S. SO HOW

01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:34.914
DOES SPEC OF. I WANT TO FOCUS

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:36.382
ON. PART I CAN YOU WHAT YOU

01:52:36.449 --> 01:52:38.051
WOULD SIX. AND I WILL ALSO TELL

01:52:38.118 --> 01:52:39.686
YOU WHAT WE WOULD NOT VERY

01:52:39.752 --> 01:52:41.888
SUCCESSFUL. AND DUCK THERE WERE

01:52:41.955 --> 01:52:43.423
SOME LESSONS LEARNED THE FIRST

01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:45.125
THING WAS TO BE RECOGNIZED

01:52:45.191 --> 01:52:47.060
EARLY ON I DO BECAUSE I COMMEND

01:52:47.127 --> 01:52:49.529
MY TEAM MEMBER SAID DOE. YES

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:52.332
FOLKS WERE JUST AMAZING- IS

01:52:52.398 --> 01:52:55.201
NOT. A BIG PORTION OF THE COST

01:52:55.268 --> 01:52:57.570
OF SOLAR WAS THE SOFT COST.

01:52:57.637 --> 01:52:58.905
TERMS ARE PEOPLE ARE FOCUSING

01:52:58.972 --> 01:53:00.640
ON THE PANEL COSTS AND STUFF

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:01.841
BUT CHINA WAS DOING A LOT OF

01:53:01.908 --> 01:53:03.710
THE MANUFACTURING. AND THEY

01:53:03.776 --> 01:53:05.311
WERE BRINGING THE COST DOWN BY.

01:53:05.378 --> 01:53:07.814
THE WAS A TIME WHERE THE COST

01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:09.516
OF. RUNNING THE STORE OF THE

01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:11.050
FINANCING THE INTERCONNECT

01:53:11.117 --> 01:53:13.486
ISSUES THE INSPECTION ALL OF

01:53:13.553 --> 01:53:14.654
THOSE THINGS WERE VERY VERY

01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:17.290
EXPENSIVE. SO ONE SUNTRUST DID

01:53:17.357 --> 01:53:19.559
WAS REALLY TO PUT A BIG FOCUS

01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:20.827
ON THE SO CALLED SOFT COST.

01:53:20.894 --> 01:53:23.196
ONCE WE LAUNCHED PROGRAMS-

01:53:23.263 --> 01:53:24.597
PEOPLE ATTRIBUTE THIRD PARTY

01:53:24.664 --> 01:53:27.000
FINANCING FOR EXAMPLE BACK IN

01:53:27.066 --> 01:53:27.867
TWENTY TEN DODD WAS NOT VERY

01:53:27.934 --> 01:53:30.336
POPULAR TODAY THAT'S BASICALLY

01:53:30.403 --> 01:53:32.172
THE VERY ACCEPTED PROCESS. BY

01:53:32.238 --> 01:53:33.873
WHICH YOU CAN DO THESE KINDS OF

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.775
FINANCING. HOW DOES ONE

01:53:35.842 --> 01:53:38.311
OVERCOME INERTIA INCOMES OF THE

01:53:38.378 --> 01:53:40.213
UTILITIES INCOME SO INTEGRATING

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:42.248
SOLAR WHICH IS A VERY BILL

01:53:42.315 --> 01:53:43.750
RESOURCE WHAT I'M- INTO THE

01:53:43.816 --> 01:53:45.418
NETWORK AND WE WORKED. QUITE A

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:46.753
BIT WITH THE UTILITIES SOME OF

01:53:46.819 --> 01:53:48.054
THEM WERE VERY EASY TO WORK

01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:54.327
SOMEWHAT A LITTLE BIT. MORE

01:53:54.394 --> 01:53:55.862
DIFFICULT. THE ONE THING THAT-

01:53:55.929 --> 01:53:58.431
I. YEAH WOULD HAVE LIKED A DONE

01:53:58.498 --> 01:54:00.466
MORE. IS MANY. I HAVE TO TELL

01:54:00.533 --> 01:54:01.568
YOU ALL. I'M VERY OBSESSED

01:54:01.634 --> 01:54:03.903
ABOUT MANUFACTURING WITHIN THE

01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:05.705
UNITED STATES WE NEED TO MAKE A

01:54:05.772 --> 01:54:07.240
KID IN THIS COUNTRY AND STELLAR

01:54:07.307 --> 01:54:10.443
WORK WHITE. AND SO WE HAD

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:11.411
GOTTEN INTO THIS GAME A LITTLE

01:54:11.477 --> 01:54:13.379
BIT LATER BECAUSE CHINA HAD

01:54:13.446 --> 01:54:14.447
ALREADY MIDDLE PART OF THE

01:54:14.514 --> 01:54:16.716
INVESTMENT TODAY 90% OF SOLAR

01:54:16.783 --> 01:54:18.651
MANUFACTURING. IS IN CHINA. AND

01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:20.286
IS NOW COMMODITIZED SORTS BUT

01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:21.454
YOU DIFFICULT FOR A NEW

01:54:21.521 --> 01:54:24.157
TECHNOLOGY- THAT'S BASED ON NEW

01:54:24.224 --> 01:54:25.925
INVENTIONS TO MAKE IT THERE.

01:54:25.992 --> 01:54:27.026
I'M NOT WAS ONE OF THE BIG

01:54:27.093 --> 01:54:28.528
LESSONS LEARNED THE ONE THING

01:54:28.595 --> 01:54:30.163
THAT I WAS PUSHING FOR PART I

01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:31.831
WAS HONORED TO BE DO AT THAT

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:33.933
POINT. YES IF YOU REALLY WANTED

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.668
TO THE MANUFACTURING THE

01:54:35.735 --> 01:54:37.403
FINANCIAL SECTOR HAS TO BE

01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:39.339
INFORMED WAY AHEAD OF RATED

01:54:39.405 --> 01:54:41.774
WHAT'S- TYPICALLY WE DON'T DO

01:54:41.841 --> 01:54:42.942
THE INNOVATION BIRD WALKS I'LL

01:54:43.009 --> 01:54:44.310
GIVE YOU A QUICK NUMBER AND

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:45.812
THEN I'LL FINISH UP. IF YOU

01:54:45.878 --> 01:54:48.014
LOOK AT FINANCING IN EQUITY

01:54:48.081 --> 01:54:50.717
FINANCING 75% OF THAT WAS

01:54:50.783 --> 01:54:51.985
HAPPENING IN THE U. S. IN THE

01:54:52.051 --> 01:54:54.120
SOLAR SPACE. WHICH MADE A LOT

01:54:54.187 --> 01:54:55.922
OF START UP COMPANIES ALL OF

01:54:55.989 --> 01:54:56.522
THOSE GUYS PUT EQUITY

01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:59.025
FINANCING. ON DEBT FINANCING

01:54:59.092 --> 01:55:01.995
ONLY 11% WASN'T THE U. S. BACK

01:55:02.061 --> 01:55:03.363
FINANCING IS WHERE YOU BRING

01:55:03.429 --> 01:55:05.365
FACTORIES TO MAKE PRODUCTS AND

01:55:05.431 --> 01:55:07.200
SOUGHT. WE WILL NOT DOING THAT

01:55:07.267 --> 01:55:09.002
WELL BECAUSE OUR TWO SECTORS IN

01:55:09.068 --> 01:55:10.570
THE FINANCIAL SECTOR WERE

01:55:10.637 --> 01:55:12.839
DISCONNECTED. AND THEREFORE I

01:55:12.905 --> 01:55:14.207
THINK WHEN WE START TO PUT THE

01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:16.509
LITHIUM KANEMI TOGETHER PERHAPS

01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:18.511
WE SHOULD GET ALL OF THEM INTO

01:55:18.578 --> 01:55:21.180
THE SAME ROOM. WHEN WE MAKE ALL

01:55:21.247 --> 01:55:22.749
THE DECISIONS SO THAT WE KNOW

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:24.050
HOW THE MANUFACTURER IS GOING

01:55:24.117 --> 01:55:26.185
TO HAPPEN. WHEN IT GETS TO

01:55:26.252 --> 01:55:28.321
MONETIZE THE MARGIN SO SALUTE-

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:29.722
THEN YOU REALLY NEED THE

01:55:29.789 --> 01:55:31.057
SUPPORT OF THE BIG FINANCIAL

01:55:31.124 --> 01:55:32.892

EXPERIENCE WHAT ALSO WAS A

01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:39.098
LITTLE BIT TOO LATE. AND WE

01:55:39.165 --> 01:55:40.667
