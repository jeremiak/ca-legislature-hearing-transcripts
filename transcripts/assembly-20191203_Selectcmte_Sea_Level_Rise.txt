My name's Tasha burner were rather like to welcome you. The end. To be back as many of you know I was elected the state SMS council my for over. Seven up in the world. So I did get your Cooper mission today- I want to thank the city of Anthony is for allowing us to you chamber we have city manager Karen breast there on the back thank you so much for calling us to be the chamber. And we a hard stop at five PM so we'll- go to public. Kind of look. I like to encourage the rule. That we have an instant it is that if you agree with that statement. Do little chance. That way we see you all the way in the back that you agree. We can. Bonta. And I want to thank. The coming senators that we have here we have. O'donnell assembly member Todd Gloria. And is that lay ahead- and addressing the impacts of sea level rise specifically as they relate to the California economy so we know there are lots of impacts of sea level rise to many different aspects so when I. Look at this and I think about sea level rise my California economy especially what it means. In San Diego county but throughout the state. The thing one is the M. it's gonna and then the second as our infrastructure and the third which. I think is probably the most timely when we look at now that we have in del Mar. To do with the at. And of course those just. This focus areas the all have- but I'd like to- really reiterate we know the sea level is rising. We have. High tides and for. Ocean our direct tax in California this is. Putting now and we just saw the reports that more and of the rail corridor in del Mar has fallen away we know this is we're probably a little too late for this discussion so when we talk about our issues and we think about them. Really like us to look at how do we move forward to action. It a lot amber this. We have. Cut pressing issues now throughout our state that we need to address we know. Will governments have. I was in a city council I was a co chair of the sea level rise subcommittee. Where we were looking at our phone local infrastructure in this area and I know with stand out of the showing preservation working group we looked and take a take an evaluation. Of the entire coastline and sandy of county on where is double structure and. Areas that we can come together and work together best to make sure we have the best outcome not only for today but for tomorrow. And then we know as a state where our priorities can be and how do we better coordinate these efforts into real change. So before first path to get to open up to the assembly members and senator Bates for any. Comments that you license will have thank you so much for being here. Madam but this and I just. Asian your district today of these are all all three are fine representatives of your area I know Mr Gloria you're next door but still- you you to work together very well along with the senators so I appreciate the opportunity to sit here today and really learn more than I already know because I don't. Know enough but why am I here- specifically my district have went back to see low rise I represent seventy sunny district. Long home stand Catalina island so ground zero right I'm a priest Adam economy on to this hearing it's not just about sea level rise but the impact struck on me I represent that both ports right let one of largest port complexes in the world. And sea level rise has already impacting them I represent a lot of homes on the beach. Already ma'am I was reading some articles as I came down. I to this hearing and I think the two numbers resonated in. Mind the most were ninety nine over the last hundred years we've lost nine inches of beach but in the next four years will lose nine feet of beach and that's going to have a significant impact on our last stop on economy we need to be prepared. For that fact and as the local. In the last few years we've seen climate change impact our fire season well I think we're going to face the same dynamic. On the ocean front and we need to be prepared for that night you know our coaching building homes these places. Are starting. Their bill. Homes in the persons and then ultimately our economy insurance rates etcetera so with that I thank you again madam chair. For the invitation here today and I look forward to listening and learning more. Of thank you madam chair nothing construed. Offers comments I'm glad that does that so making a it's good to see. The great Khali among. Yeah to be set up thank you we owe. The cook and of. Our to represent isn't quite not a C. O. del Mar and so on a beach I see America surged in his head thank you for putting him on the agenda Medina has been able and pourtant voice on this issue in his community really taken so the tougher issues on how you implement or deal with this and so I'm grateful that you're giving him. The platform to share I think other cities could learn what. May for making time today. I'm just. I want to let everyone know that. Boerner Horvath and I have been collaborating China state do. See an budget next year. One you have a post là. Ask your state senator president pro tem Toni Atkins able secure significant funding tried state for will stay busy in the more plus area though quizzes are emergency. The. In this right there ago anyway certainly add my appreciation to. AB. Putting this together I think we're all here the bill here find solutions. Heard from her seat we've also heard often environmental style. Concerns than everyone else on points of this problem we aye the Anthony. Bob purchased a home here in Encinitas we still have it and we used to visit the beach here always it was always slow so much fun so recently after the bluff collapse I toured the beaches and I was shocked shocked to see how much how much is not left. In terms of- what has happened over those several decades so see rice's real of for those who are not comfortable with that I am very comfortable with that because I've witnessed it it affects my district at thirty six Senate district runs from Rancho Santa Margarita yeah and the Orange County down through and so need of sorry here in north San Diego county so I have- coastal cities all along the way recently and send committee- coastal trail that. We work so long I was on the Orange County Board of supervisors to ensure that we have the funding for that and it would go through all the various sub permitting- we lost a part of that due to a bluff collapse so now that coastal trail and someone. Who I thought was absolutely wonderful- passed away and it was projects so I would hope some day we it's going to be named in her honor back thinking about I felt a few tears from heaven when that happened we also have to Capistrano. Beach we lost out to with the high price and that was a huge recreational area for the people in south Orange County cities of data points and committee and surrounds so it's real in it so- I think great that we're all here in a bipartisan way with experts that will help us I navigate this very very difficult. Problem and the solution that we can all get behind it is going to be a little bit of every part of the question is going to there's to be a little bit a compromise that have staff to happen but every France that's what I'm here to hold to hear from experts and how we approach. Thank you again and yes time to pull. Sec so I'd like to our first now is sealevel rise what is the state up against an invite doctor mark Meer filled director center for climate change impacts and adaptations institute of oceanography at UCSD we're so fortunate to have such a premier organization- an institution of research just in our backyard- really helping us to address some of these. Issues so the floor is yours. Thank you for the invitation to speak and I have a lot to cover ten minutes all just jump right to it. So what are we up against what we facing so this plot. Is a projection of sea level into the future for this is global but it is AB pregnant for California as well. So yellow line is where we've been you can see will slow seal riser last century. And then those lines going off to the right or projections are based on different scenarios for. A carbon use coverage a missions- output and also some sciences come to bear however how stable the green. Of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets actually are. All I want to emphasize with this plot there's a lot of detail here but what I want to emphasize is first of all the- magnitude of what the- okay the man the man but that so we're looking at anywhere from two to eight feet of sea level rise by the in the century. Depending on the scenario. The other thing size the uncertainty there's a quite a range here that it's hard to make projections it's hard to make actionable- decisions based on this sort of information you need more detail- the other bit of it is the timing so where we are right now at the end of the yellow curve. You can hear the our future for soft the- office. Senate yes. It means that we have a choice true path with- for most think of. How to do it will rise. Is how to the mission. And how to keep. Going forward our job. Is to take is going to be. I was a with which we keep that curve down. What the set up. What's it all for you coast fact. Some maps. A moderate celos attempt to see by some sort of center. On top and storm thing significant but he dot green it is flat after of brown's owns a lot. Earlier than flood. Zones and so where you the server. Sure we can. Some hot just Kobe San Diego of inter county- Orange County new Newport Newport beach. And that flooding will bring with packs us. Structure will be. Ports and calm will have to deal with the tires levels rational Tiffany's talked about the truck. And of course many of the- other I'm supposed highways are will be impacted. And many facilities are among the most which. Here's a that hi fi. Not only the beaches because there are to be a core class this is work Adam young- a survey that was done that was just before one of these cliff collapses. I just by happenstance they happen to be there and captured this- this happens frequently I think Adam show this last winter as being a particularly. I'm. Or slides were particularly prominent throughout the winter season. And we- heavy rains have already started so that was the fall let's see I think there's a little dramatic pause here. Keeps going. This is a natural of phenomena. It's. As a more weight impact at the shore là. Honest two minutes later. And shot and of course here the card on top of that so- chest heading home how vulnerable that hold out. Yes okay so what can we do that's why we're here so what sort of actions can we take our first of all a some of the information that we have to deal with while it's very useful for long. Term projections it's not it's hard to make. A definitive plan. Need more. In about. It a base for that act quantifies the impacts flooding on the Cup what's the second can pass along a rose to view what's- ships and pose for since shoreline that based on exit it's hard to kind of scared from to predict what happened. Though not. Database out percent I these infants are happy day not likely to change in the future. Also the economic impact CNN but our making some great strides in imperial beach with a search the dance team this was on a forecast it was Mayes last last winter and part of. Understanding flooding is understand. Pleasant so were dedicate helping them get a better understanding floods. Answer and so they can do so planet buzz how the world into still Lara. Is in a couple of a cat. Came that prop. Hey so. As I said there's a lot of uncertainty going forward click those curves are- quite different difference so you have to do is buy step proactive approach to- adaptation so it's called triggered an adept pathways. So this is all some strategies to try take some pretty open the shore in their- search for. You my are out of the- and I. The left side. Water level rises far enough for the be. Advice all you have to some of us structure or some sort harder topic along shoreline that's passed by a. I and eight and that'll serve. Dozens and at some point they have to be some actual- up open what. I'm on the impacts understand and the when you make these ages what is trigger. Prompt you from current that's where the path and someone. Think that have to be back on scientific information in these are all decisions but again with that and Ste information about flood out has database of the flood and cal yeah we'll be more informed decisions about how to. Approach this problem. The other thing I should know it is not. I think California should look the way in a. In developing our our innovative strapped for sure. So what is person strategy for our show as many of the- guidance is a come out are for sure lines on the east coast. As we want to think about California's house lines are settlement our way climate is the best management strategy how often should happen what's the grains. I'm sure we built. Up if the blood was the living shoreline it was put in a part of. Task I really. Need to understand the process and call that. Affect California the test for coastal protection. Our research we don't I am the team after that's for sure but we do need to have such as a better understanding of how predict nama. So was slot. Katie I see is if you. We have the personal blocks over the summer this is what. I get scraps. Base of down that'll in the new year I color plot what's- but it be up Baker. Sir with the light ours going. Of the July. Thirty August in under. Leaving little fast but what to do I the very start embrace a mitigation policies were tens and keep the rocks as well going forward I'm we need a slang misinformation so cal. Present each year impacts that's some will leave in some form. Information that will. Here's the we can catch on at held is to find a data ways to results. I are still to do it in predict the mops of copal change reaches plus. Calvet you should the Senate demonstrate prior to that also the strategies go forward. See this is the- run up hearing I'm sorry next panel please have three local elected from San Diego cap- so like to call you up the penalty- over here so you can sit comfortably. On. And we're protecting Costa committees from the rising seize the local government perspective and experience we have councilmember Kelly he said even senators. Rank ocean I am search did enough city of them pearl beach thank you so much we can start in that order if you're comfortable hoping that my presentation reached Dave chop this is a. So I come here Catherine breaks for is join us in the back everybody welcome our favorite mare. Accept research is also a favorite mayor a lot favorite mayors and San Diego county. Do each of you have a presentation so if not work on getting killers presentation we can start research is that work out. Yeah present ride your presentation okay well I can get started as okay hasn't Asians coming up so- marks everything I was to say so. No I'm just kidding but so my name's Kelly she has he I'm- here. So it's an honor to be sitting here at a local government. Perspective it's all very humbling to remote experts- and thank you only members and are so are for the- thing this in it. Rather than Sacramento bee is. Thinking into nida's opportune. It is the this matters and see what you know what. What is it that we're trying to preserve and how do that'll gather so. For my presentation begins in the men's room the way. Ono well could I a let's see what we need I can with a global. While cal is right now presentation when I recognize a council for. A she's the hope hotel. Email. The card Jerry Howard from Anthony this what did I miss any other elected officials that I should have called out I'm sorry. While working on the present there's white will. You know what what are you are you to. Write one. Yellow they are for mayor. And white one the back thank you for joining us. It's like the way the public in the way on the city council. That would like to give presentations. Thank you. Ask yeah I thought we had thought we had pink slips Republican I realized no longer on the city council we don't have. Okay so prior to- my time here on council I served at the Leucadia main street station. And so were a chamber of commerce Julie for a historic visit district. It has been a lot of time. North coast one of which is the historic business. That's also one of our principal transportation. I'm one good to talk about intersection of steel right and Oakley because of the two topics that I'm passionate about. So up. Is there a local sobre universe all mom pop businesses just this past may I'm as you can see an event poster we are so proud of our- into the code we us so much of a tentative our small business up into the fact that were beach adjacent we are visitor search commercial not serves both. Locals and- as far as far as imperial valley imperial. Me out zona and you see that during the summer. So beach people come here for. A for our businesses. I'm some one is that it was created to be a- just. To conveyance that's all it was designed to do getting people from LA to town San Diego or to. For the years we've seen that the functionality of this road has changed as a community. Charlie. Brown's was born I think it's always been not the corner here of ash hi everyone I want and that was all- auto serving a card it ship and recently they respond to the changing culture and they re open and read. It as Charlie's electric by. Good example in a ship in our economy. That beautiful store that was struck by local artists are him out and you can see. Lights were. Oct Bob. Food so highly one one really is our town square it's a these are people come together it has to about- in and of itself to just. From point a to point B. our our our like. Both our economy and to coastal act yes in taxes start talking about all rights because not only is it transportation but also these other two. Parts of what it what the Stevenson it assist is made up. So what we're not lose that in thirty three sixty six per cent of beaches southern California this is. So hard right around I don't even think that I fully done it yet and most. Armored. Zero beaches which is Annie this is our majority of B. we really only have two beaches left that you can go during even a medium tied which- one is now in Cardiff and other one is moonlight beach. And so here to- images to illustrate the child that we're up against. The left you'll see a photo from the twenty eighteen stone steps toward on test is. A much loved community event. Gives birth to our small businesses. Because people come for this event people have a living area for a long time they- they come back to locate enjoy it. But as you can see there was no beach and so. They kind of left everybody thinking I can still surf but there's just this specter. Vent that's missed. So what you see over the years is fewer and fewer days that we can actually enjoy our beaches and the other effects of that is that. Our recreational opportunities are limited our exercise opportunities are limited and this is a really threaten ecosystem in southern California. That we're seeing get smaller and smaller by the day. This year the San papers are out there so take a look if you have a chance to get down there- and on the right that's a an example of a success so this is the living shoreline project- I found out recently that Larry Giles who's our marines. Safety captain. He is a fourth generation and intonation. It's a need. And that he he remembered when this was- do not attack and so this was sort of impetus of. How can we engineer re engineer dunes that have multi benefits including infrastructure protection for this really practice. Connection between. It's a need us in our- subsidies. Infrastructure protection- replacement of historic ecosystem so it's amazing I think we had our first snow you clover- make a nest there last year it didn't. Last but the hope is that they will learn that this is a place where they can find rest. And we even added. A improve our coastal access with Gen walkway. Highway and right to do even though you're not a beach up there still will to interact with the ocean and able to enjoy our coastal. And we added four acres of this project so that those and it's come a new destination and a lot of ways- so these are the images from last Tuesday. It was six point six tied we had lots of service to. See start and to. Or if roof and these photos were taken caption there Giles- and the middle one was taken of Leucadia beat its grand view and in Leucadia. No beaches the only people there a go to the beach that day were really if Sir. To keep. These what steps and jump off and get into the ocean but beach access. I'm this was taken on thinks. Is also located. Side part of this is just I'm size part that. We have a local music will there we host of events that the- AB small businesses come together. So it's all because of the dedicated. That would be able to turn this a park back into apart from big back into a park for surf top which is almost as. If that had been etched. And you'll see the in the background you. A manual pumps are still out there even. We didn't get off the event it's still challenge for us. I'm so coastal region comes in a whole bunch of different varieties which means that we have to react we have to message we have to respond in. Many different ways so you see that photo the far left was a discreet episode think happened in just a moment. And as a mark Gen there's vegetation that have ice plant I can't any other chronic inclusion but- looks like it could have been part of that feel in the middle this is a case in US ongoing stumping. Up doesn't. It. But he really even talk to missus isn't. That much of note and on the right had a catastrophic failure summers I think we all still field believe me a lot the lives of. Three shifts community map. Dot thank. Coastal phone- program in ministry and dot person is like. To you a couple of projects that works about happening right now in the city of Encinitas. You have two minutes. Okay I'll run through this I'm Jamie to really come the some program administrator for the city best a which is funded and by at a transient occupancy tax that was established in nineteen ninety eight through a local proposition the program and I are dedicated solely to building coastal resilience and facilitating beach restoration projects through a phased out of. Reach so what these- efforts is the at St compatibility which is to use program or stoop we maintain these per. Their federal and state regulators permits which help streamline the process dean. And depositing high quality compatible and low volume amounts of San. You are road beaches under the skew program Sanders obtained through opportunistic sources which may include the goon in the aging is my construction basin maintenance or habitat restoration projects. Additionally the coastal management program advocates and coordinates with the army corps of engineers and elected state officials in pursuit a fifty year and mostly federally funded large beach nourishment project. The coastal storm damage reduction project as it's called at plans to place three hundred forty thousand cubic yards of sand initially and. Two hundred twenty thousand cubic yards every five years after that. For only be. The product hills taking San from for press. And place it in a wide berm at the very bluff through nine nourishment. I from these types of nurse projects ongoing scientific studies form beach and bluff management teams and help us plan the dot for long term sea level rise. Beats with and by our bi annually state at least across the whole city. And said he's been perfect part of. Highway one by both CLA and use S. T. bluff management studies are also currently underway we are investigating the causes of bluff failures as as they relate to vegetation. The city is C. to devise a bluff vegetation management I'd with the goal of providing. In seizing. Guidance to private residence and state parks on how best to manage. Create less vulnerable hazardous mission. The city consistent studies near Sharif's to ensure that all out it's been cleaned efforts are not negatively affecting our offshore biota. These studies specifically will inform long term adaptation solutions such as the creation of artists to reefs. That could facilitate San retention. Okay I'm gonna get through it. Thirty seconds oh my goodness okay I'm gonna skip this one but our highway has continued to adopt as we have to become a gathering. For people of. All abilities all ages together they're out of carbon- emitting vehicles of X. on foot strollers wheelchairs. That's what our highways working often hear some of our a new users we didn't see a lot of those before. This I could have on one street scape and using Jack that- trees question been chopper rain water provide access. Senate bill road to the beach and then lastly how are later can assist us. So we need some Caltrans coordination with. Right prior to our critical infrastructure assets of the family hold a goon is it ranks highly- for their funding and it should be because it's very vulnerable we need help eliminate access or beach the PC no longer wants a permit crossings but are the cheapest sixteen usually forts we're gonna need some help- under crosses them and also we need more collaboration between our non regulatory agencies to help our cities. And running before having to act can't talk. I el amendment. And then lastly settlement and addresses you know we find out that. Sentiment trapped in our local watersheds how do we get it where it needs to be to the beaches and not have to. Eat so much for with private developers to do that- so if anybody wants to write a letter to. The army corps that's a contact info and that would be helpful thank you. I love the action orientation of the last five. Yes thank you councilmember cut. Almost like thirds I wanna. Here I want to thank assembly member about for having us I think one of our biggest challenges going forward is to have this collaboration any successful solution was gonna bald us is I can- and so any a mitigation efforts we don't impact our neighbors native. Negatively gathered tele. I'm gonna steer away from some macros just focus on our unique challenge Oceanside. And having an in for us this a speculative issue. Now and we need to take action immediate I don't. Our to along motions aye and what a what so have the CEO of visit oceans and. And as you brought up earlier there are economic on. Coastal provision could. Once is our city so this first picture it gives you a really good over view she died and- for those you were not aware we are the third biggest city in the county by population about a hundred seven five was in the of three to four miles. Three miles across the street from. Ten in our harbor as you can see to. Carlsbad to this so it but I cannot. West. We are a public utilities and we have a lot of our drivers are driven by our beaches so we have. An estimate we provide our beat writer she provides about hundred job. Room three hundred fifty one million annual visitors spending and twenty two and state and local taxes and a lot SB Joran and we have a Venn super approach is it's a fantastic event for us and- I've taken my daughter there several years and just incredible for our- region answer. That have a soccer term at the beach so it is our beaches are integral part our state and mark successfully hinges on. Other of our beaches. So going through start for north south we harbor it's your unique to our being that starts a camp Gen. Out of the Santa Margarita river more work to. But what finished as it does is it stops function Santa support from north south so with that and mark the river. So my group eight light tan post but at. The pretty pictures most back. Beaches are Beach until ten and they want to be. When you decide you can still get learn more. So our check is open year. The hopper dreads that's army corps of engineers broad and generally happens every spring and you can see from the ocean between the outer breakwater their break water fills up a sand from the law sure San transport every spring and has. Rights to get to the proper depths. Product that is sand that will. Which is but very many it doesn't actually. Sir be as much as we need so and that's one of our main challenges is you know how do we get some at San from north of the harbour to south no water harbor does have- causes its fair share of sand issues it's also a great economic driver as well so. It not only does have the del Mar both basin for K. Senate's although almost a thou slip order a harbor. Also regional asset that is a fantastic place whether you sail or even take well watching it it's a great opportunity we just need to. Learn how to work with it and get the sand around that I that's been our- biggest challenge. The north the south we also miss our beach and while. Maybe you to have as a long wooden pier Wescott in this kind of Morrell. S. a man structures and for so as you go of the south from the pier. Your week we have a unique to on our coast were. About a hundred- a much for coastal land was subdivided in plan for resident no so we have streets and houses up right on the beach there protected by these rock revetments. We don't have a healthy each the way to go into a commitments at the state agency we're dealing with now. Our best laid out as that. Through on a healthy beach also impacting those revetments at home so this is a challenge we've had for awhile but now it's becoming extreme as you can see in this picture. Close that's our strand we club road regularly during high tides and when we have- more swelled the normal. It's a challenge we're already seeing damage to houses. And those are we have about five homes that we roughly a dinner a dinner coastal hazards vulnerability assessment. Five hundred million dollar and property value in million dollars every year. And residential property tax so it's a it's a big on ports of our city. Economic. Mmhm success is down there it's gonna be I was going forward to address some of the houses that are located there. I want to go. On to conclude that's our southern border which the it's on these houses and very. Portable how's but since I found it three side by what so they're gonna impact and his rise or any stand. Which in the end we are you check Gen oceans I think. Really impacted are the- I think I'm going back this really illustrates this picture is a great. Example of shoes you see the sand stopping north of the harbor and we install it so. I don't know how the left wing. This is this. Is not in your twenty year this is it she we're dealing with now and it's could come in. We address it and so we focused the next fifteen to twenty years you know that way we don't the spec it. Out about two feet of sea level Rafe. Yes it's almost irrelevant we have an issue to deal with immediately and it's to be Chao. We've. It numerous letters army corps of engineers asking for fees of study and that's what on what can we do with our endorsement. Impact does the harbor have. Mission promised in twenty twenty- get put on the priorities so I can tell you the good news the sounds of the council unanimously passed a step for us go ahead and route in the nourishment. Là via. She's we have all our city were all work in the right direction to get those beaches help again but it's going to be a challenge so they also have our- principle planner from the city rest Cunningham who is kind lead the move. City to. This fight what the effects will be so again for having us. Thank you. The thank you very much for that I appreciate you doing. Man it really helps us understand the similarities between the cities and the difference. And now mayor to Tina. Great I think I have a present and I'm imperial beach the stopping of the county. Bob blue collar town twenty thousand people third of our kids live in poverty 25% poverty rate. So really the frame here is gonna be really about equity. And really not just about economic development but about the development we don't have. And the fact that when we have flooded floods cleaned or be on our streets that means that's money were taken away. From life are problems and try to get a part. Because we don't. We don't have. Recently grocery store so we're not there were some percent of. Our. Living in Iraq hide your pride making ends. Not just about it in in poppy ride like inch with trailer parks are still tight you know it you you see I hope. That's not the sort of issue there were dressing on a drug issue same and my pop he is. Making sure that we can we can carry out of for that are still live in poverty and have a great quality of life to send your kids an insidious Russian side or. Throughout southern California how we're surrounded on three sides. To start. Any to wallow if you know straight obviously. Rising that's going to be end up. In my area there is kids I'm. Might you know I grew up in ivy my focus right now isn't to still buys it make sure to my can walk street not by a car that's the issue right like paving always were crosswalks I am interested to your leads back of unpaved alleys right people were because I can get to their home. Was ending and thanks we've been able heaving always doing our rates are and you know on the grocery store right across all that reading a trader Joe's real whole foods. Grocery outlet that's what works for our community the- well for us right. And in addition to the toxic waste in storage at the club southern be trait eight months right so we are dealing all the new things try to fight for community. In dealing boxing is to bridge. As our southern beach last year's on is. Close right now so what are your servers were. Big waves the last week especially the bay. Guys run the water. Disclosed pollutant charts rough level this is a state. Feel state I surely this because this is a reality on on where the- I think is right. It's gonna be shows dealers a video which of you can press up now yeah see. Thanks mark the guys have been help. The transcripts be John Gould has lived in vero beach again for a little over a year. He's already gotten loose. It was my. Sixteen high tide. They haven't once or twice sorry. No that was last year. Worse. I script predicted that the light the minute thank you mark. We were we can is four days in advance what really really hot on. So anyway we actually carried out on talking to twenty fifteen op I think the California coast commission California coast Conservancy and are sending a foundation I see the rise in by. This and- but. The supervisor base structure on so. We found that on again impacts. On throughout our community it a total a lot Buck. A lot of cost of ink on route the city not just the west side of this right by the ocean but on our bay front. And identifying the few flooding right this is actually were built on the salt flat rock Michael upland habitat from. It back the day was flooded right looks like supposed to be I'm so what we find about 40% of all roads will be about. A Silverlight rise 2110030% a part in buildings arm and in. South. Pretty so often and here I think the forty three different. Things we can do all I took a hundred saw. Dr if we only focused on manage retreat and get mad the people don't want to lose our homes and were surprised that we see what happened del Mar and ID. Then we're going to spend the next hundred years being at war with the wealthy speak on the planet. I'm not doing allocation. I think what you're seeing at the statewide level and on and on the global level as it was at the meditation meeting in now to sign in in in our in in April. Or may we have people from all over the world actually talking meditation is they realize that if we're just gonna get in a box about manage retreat. With private property owners we're not to preserve our coast we've got to figure out we've got to be a lot smarter about how to do this. And we got to broaden the scope of what we do. Not talk about the address but I'm we know we know who paid for we know who process obviously the client the- fossil fuel industry so. We were the first city world to sue the fossil fuel industry for causing surprise. It was. My Richmond Santa Cruz. Carries a separate tailing brand. All older now by state of Rhode Island to more. As the fact is I think this is a big thing legislators. We have zero money to deal with this zero money either want to pay my straight to make sure that my kids have a great quality of life kids who live in poverty. Or I can find the money from somewhere and reality is we're gonna figure this out for California so on I wanna think scripts for this our coastal monitoring forecasting flooding model it's brilliant it's genius. Loves talk to scripted wrote scientists on our beaches with low they call. Taking a class. And use it top world prop that helps. Run flow. If your local calls plan. Which is in about as a regulatory box about something that happened over the next hundred years. All right who has to deal with the next hundred years right. If we think it's been hot it is a reason it's hard because we're not we're not process been built. To deal with for years right we can over the next ten minutes in the next ten years but not on for years it's complex stuff. Research figure. Out park or because the plan to deal with. Watashi. Destructive right public the structure. Republican for sure public pressure that's our obligation to address the construction we're gonna. All natural climate solutions restoration right restoration restoration restaurant. On the beach us let's take the next better could not test. On to be. Should with natural ecosystems we are so behind we've got to be ahead of the curve and I've talked to leaders Sacramento the resource. God way Crofoot. This we've got to be better on this and- figure out how to given agencies like the poor the airport authority or send act in Senate to question more carbon. The enough for one the solutions. And then maybe even do offsets for it right and then finally. Eight there's a kid from the valley kids are to make sure. This weather. Is Sir. Where is it. When the water could not be that's what it is right right. I say manage. What's happening or even I be is to be expected if you come up planned the says. It it's will tell you that you might have to move out your houses in three years of course people get upset we should expect. We have to be smarter about how we do this I saw presentation by mark called is that the ocean protection council I think folks in Sacramento we're talking climate bond are really thinking strategically about this and saying if we get sucked in. To adults with private you know the wealthiest people on the planet. We're not. Storm protect the entire California coastline blocking. For well as assembly hold a gun and- we think stand for billing project assembly hall. Hello talk about it. But that's we have to focus on these. Big picture. Public infrastructure protecting our beaches right. On restore our natural wetlands. And doing those things robin just. Spending 99% of our time doc. But private property. Just cried since this battle that. Districts a losers that set the other day Hey we always wanted on the beach right so thank you very much. What's but no less from my age to Dana thank you so much for really at addressing the elephant that I think is in the room. How do you really talk matter that Tatian when there's conflict involved. In the interest of time running about five minutes behind we're gonna move straight to the next panel of the so I hope for. Our panel will- of to limit centers. Will remove. No solutions to see level right we have Jacob Gould single senior legal counsel for in north county transit district. Calling plans for the director of regional planning. And ag I think once a few words welcome to join us branded read director of planning of fail us for this vehicle county regional airport authority as well as Eileen mayor- direct. Environmental conservation for the port. Wait intro to the next panel because he mentioned I think half of the agencies are all the agencies that are going to be presenting so we can go ahead and start with Jacob. Would you like to make some introductory comments. Thank you very much- glad to see you by the way don't tell. I felt that the five. Have I appreciate being here at this hearing I've been here for a year. I am bay area I seen how close the track to the beach. And I can tell you that. If you think about it. Let's say god forbid operations stop. We could read out passengers what to do with freight 10% of old many fact card was so LA law. Mr Donahue but one with Christ said the LA a Long Beach we said we need the state to help and we get to a bond be money. To build goods moment the first Sector-Limón Senate that that very well. We need the same level here. I promise you it's Sunday. We are gonna once and for all. Official to do immediate things we did- thank god for the civilization that I would engineers that either way what happened. To the to go with the- this Senate that I can get this from the not say yes to six million dollars to design the next phase that's the belies ation. We need eighty nine million dollars. To quote design construct. Civilization five five six that's immediate that's a safety issue. We should not the bill. We should figure out what get the money we should do it. Long. And I appreciate Medina said look then we have to. Face up to the fact that political solution is not get. It's not cheap. It's gonna và moving the fax Ellen is gonna involved and a lot of if structure work that were not used to and it's gonna cost in the billions. Of the millions. And I promise you I met to you that in eighteen months. You will see the solutions in the table on I told you a some of that. Going to be any discussion partisan discussion for leaders to difficult Sir gonna here today from Colleen about specific things as he level rise and other things we were doing the five big moves. I think we're leading the country acted in how we think about the future in a press to the class provisional sustainability so with that thought then. The final. Thank you. Members of the- and I'm thank you Hassan for the introduction and I think this- actually the way we are thinking about this fits in really well for what am heard from I'm doctor Merrifield about it the key. Mitch sealevel rise as a result of that and so one of the things that we're working on it see an bag is putting a bold new transfer. Vision to really fundamentally change how people get around region have a real true transportation option driving up on so this right away that are greenhouse gas emissions is what the big moves. All of what can we please but or take the whole concept of come street. All of our made record is in the reached. At every. Door we have managed and we have a speech and Mike and Pat a lot of we are team now that is constructed in the five. Because. North train we can and to the next level. But the eighty ninety eight mile our that would be compact. With dropping mobile the heads of the centers act. Get after. Highs in transit networks to the smaller nay. Get mobility hub and throughout our community and an operator system that's what we call the bring to this team that's the technology we have all the information to help us make the best transportation choice in terms of time and be able to pay for that right on our own. New we're doing in this planning in addition to this- also the G. is using data to help in more. Ways. Pretty project. Will help move the dot in read greenhouse gas emissions starting just where people work. Reach and where they live this figure. Where where is along the coast which is important climate of all right well dark. So the Boston populated area. Read and then on where people work these are the appointment setters in our region and when you bring them together there really all with the same part of the India region in the western third. At the one block me depressed and fully. It. Now can we call our our figure eight we have a full connected high speed internet now that's also ported I. Can hi be met lanes hi stem that this will port its movement in there HM. Our poll thing and- well highs transistor trip travel option. And looking brighter begins to much of what is really focus. On what. Can bill you look this coach I think about each and were able to. More than. Read the import opportunity one we can start and development in the what the region. Not fall out it opens. It is a miles trout direct relation with greenhouse gas emissions but also we can take advantage of the carbon sequestration through preserving our open space as the- well Beach mentioned it's also important to look at though most of our growth all of our infrastructure is in the- areas. So this is the area where we're going to be making the greatest investments in the transportation network and need to be thinking about the resiliency and how we plan for these. Light of sea level rise- we've all seen the effects- this is just one example one on Taiwan a at it. This think is. Action kind of similar we see each that were having to address this up for regular basis of course what happened over the weekend where what we're we're dealing with is a many right off and rainy this step. That we toured as- well as- on blast so it's from both aspects with more violent storms that we have to be thinking about all of this in collaboration with local jurisdictions in this region and so we have eighteen cities one county ten local jerks ten cities- our have our along the coast the county is a small piece but literally every. Be with Israel Gen as is packed I see level right even down to those areas river valleys all of these are areas that are a half this is the more at risk thank debt income ratio our local state Senate's the fight the way we but or- to become. North south is. In right so this is San Diego. But if you look at this is. Here are give me my five I. Feet of sea level rise that said the top front groups talked about. You can help me that I'd with below in the red line with. Five at and the trolley these are made the court or as transportation infrastructure in this region and while we a lot of help the black the Coast. Can anyone there are big impacts also in south county Coronado strand you see these yellow areas these are the it is the are greatly. Impacted by two and a half feet. A seat all right and that shows that. Six point. Eight in level so it is up and down the coast there are major at the a issues associated with all yes. Well at Xin strip tease possible Jennifer there's a drip with everything from knowing. When to close on the street from the brace back. Now we do are you made in for sure in men's exam that. We can continue to do that the repair work to stabilize the bluffs in the Los and corridor while we are planning for an approach is a sign mentioned actually move that trade corridor further east out of them less vulnerable areas. The Los and corridor think everyone here this is the second is interest. L. but or a nation. Ask a day third out in. You're about billion in moved and something that we can forget about is portal to the F. early doesn't the rock for it and access which has a door in our and our region and the economy of our region so just to kind of wrap up we talked about the bluffs it's veto. It the right from up above. Well at. The door upset he wrote in the black from that blow. Also bridges and other infrastructure that help the poor the quarter this is the bridge today just imagine. Beat of sea level rise- six feet you see right away what that would do in this is major of that order so we just want to wrap up by saying this region is ready to work together to hold multiple work efforts at local Jr. Done a deep level it really does take a regional approach we can expect the city of imperial beach to be addressing- you know sea level rise on their own or Encinitas or del Mar Coronado it impacts the airport the port of San Diego in all of us and I think working together is an important piece we are extremely appreciative of the- funding that we receive from senator Atkins. To really start some of the work in the you don't continue the work on the low side corridor there's a lot more to do replying federal grant we are looking at every opportunity to secure funding to help make this region as resilient as possible under the circumstances will. Also plan. Reduce. With that I'll turn it over to my friend here from NC TV. Good afternoon- my name is taken goal from NCTE filling in here for our chair Tony Krantz he's been under the weather- original presentation was just gonna be a half hour of that bluff slipping. From Delmar. Will save you the terror that we've been in during for that- NCG as a transportation agency- for years under seventeen oh three. A lot of the region employer Xin of the checks was transferred over standard **** love stabilization we work closely with stand on that but the operation the date a- that is what in see TV does. We have really two sides the coin we have our infrastructure that we operate on and we have the vehicles that operate within on that infrastructure- we have transitioned are breeze fleet which is our bus fleet- almost entirely from diesel to. Natural gas- right now we have a total fleet will out of a hundred fifty vehicles nine of those are CNG and so were I are diesel the rest are CNG were making that move towards a cleaner- fleet there. Are we have currently on order were re looking to replace our seven locomotives which are currently tears zero we've had those since inception- those are. Moving up we're very shortly are on order to our tear for a clean diesel. Electric locomotives so on the G. G. application for Viçt that's were removing all of it takes a tremendous amount. In into the buses off million dollars locomotives I can imagine is quite a bit more than that- to do those rations- it takes money that obviously we don't collect from any of our writers- we rely on the state and the federal government for a lot of those grant. Application. Our backup generators for all of this is to make sure that if the power goes out we can still operate trans for those that need it some people that's the only way that they can get around- looking into that to see what we can do in corporate in green infrastructure in our capital projects that we actually implement so that we can do that in a sustainable manner. Dream is a huge issue along the entire right away- with a lot of the cities where we operate- nobody wants to see it and we- came. In for deep purple for a bus to come. With ME delayed for half an hour because the track you can see what the- it's like when it. When it's been raining for more. Twenty minutes. To meet these within the corridor were implemented. We Santa gone for capital project temptation. Bridge replacement from a hundred year old timber to deal in. That of that the potential- flood any access so that when it does. X. are and then the one that is obviously on every his mind is our bluff stabilization- what are we doing for that we've had we're currently- marble for stable to project- blood stabilization project five is actually push for were asked for additional money from the state on an emergency basis to go under in a W. W. engine. To use the tional. Have inspectors out there twenty four seven we've got crews out there. Water situation is really saw a lot of things happening you saw the picture of the whole. Keynote two feet from the track- there are piles in a lot of the block that are keeping that up so there's no immediate driven balling in. Tuition I'm what is the economic loss should something catastrophic happened- we can't calculate the entirety of that economic loss in terms of freight good- of all. Else but just the replacement cost if the rail were to be taken out you take out a two hundred foot section. Just replace that is about three hundred ten million dollars over a year almost nine hundred thousand dollars a day just to re route traffic to put all that freight onto a truck and put it on I five to get. People on the bus bridges they can get to work that does not take into account. Travel does not take into account the value goods there moved in that right which is quite a significant impact on that. Again there. The needed secured within that rely uber tell patients run in there that's not in there if that cut we losing from we lose. Lose a so it is a big deal- what we are asking the state and the federal government and grant applications we have- to their open right now- I know for del Mar bluffs five I think- that one is out for about thirty billion dollars. As the sun said it's probably closer to ninety to get the thing done- and that is not. In our next year that's a long term of. A long term item. So this one's going to be with us for a while we're looking for solutions to that and as my executive director would say show me the money. A five we have money to do it will do it. The biggest interested bring that together. Good afternoon I first want to thank the chair for inviting already to participate in this important discussion today. My name is Brandon read on the- I will fairs at the airport- before joining their fourteen years ago actually was the city to list as climate medic adaptation met. From the circle for. Really not too shocking to say that airports are incredibly important transportation asset when you're looking at the California county or even the San Diego economy last year our airports International Airport twenty million passenger. About a hundred thousand tons of move through the can that can help contribute to the airports annual economic benefit to the region about twelve billion dollars. I in this map- on the display shows it's black that is a five passed yours. I think it's just a great weather are you are a business our resident or visitor comments to break go spur. Bear serves at. The key to this region worse than all the act make. Connected with that. I'm I'm a little more optimistic it's just my nature about one thing I wanted to note is that- sea level rise is something we've actually been thinking about for awhile in this region in twenty twelve all the jurisdictions are on the air the cynical baking together enveloped a joint level rise out of two. Strategy twelve. The wild wild west prime an adaptation no. Think about it. And this is really one of the first studies like this that happened in the nation so we had some really great momentum that I wanted to recognize. Of airport authority of the last year's formalized our- strategies if you will- more- with our resilience plan. Where we look at the airports expo. She loves ice precipitate change and ting he- through. The century and then I did some quantifiable. Sure that are doing we need to do to be more recipients. So to sum it maps maps are thing we can about. At this age. Before I get to the mall going that help to warm up AB T. strategy he's just. Federal. The fate we have run away see that it down the middle. The river. Going north. The north we have a target. If but he's an- users axe them I'm- Washington Street. One thing that people don't always realize that we actually aren't right on the water we have others between us in the water line- and we have a locked so starting on our southeast corner this is actually US Coast Guard. Station. We harbor on which the poor S. and Esther's on our- own through have the same. Property. Fourth we have the marine corps with deep so I can't stress enough that regional solutions collaborative approaches for us it's a must because we can do everything on site we can but if we're not working with the port in the city and other. As a really help us at the end of the day. So this is just these are just some maps that we've done using cost us which is a of off the shelf Bob playing of. Twenty hundred. At the blue is. Flooding can adjust the level rises. Those store one your form of. So if in twenty for the you know I see some storm surge flooding along with harbor I've she is the an animal. At point to the airport and on the- very. Our we hundred and if center building again we cease storm surge really creating most of the flooding pattern at those two corners well of are pretty. When we go to a more extreme C. là press the five. Billion I'm you can. The map start. Mark I didn't see much more serious now along the entire harbor five. This group Steve Kerr water. And we have more distance thing. On west side of our can't as well. They're actually deliver. Five if you can. If you go on line down you know the- factors for the level rise in store which actually would look worse. Of those who fled. Anymore since the cut out a with. We actually. There are very airport and I'm bringing up only because fought for actions today. Really can have a big impact in twenty one hooked. And Fuller close but we didn't make those changes that I just highlighted with sea level rise in mind your we're fixing drainage issues we're just preparing the site for construction so just imagine what we can do when we have this information to inform. That design of a new terminal for say. Little optimism. So I wanted and just with that sort of some observations and lessons learned from the airports experience. I'm one again as I think now is time to. Create resilient is in the sciences forever changing and is rates up have to use the better for me we have how to. Is this our how infrastructure this transfer in infrastructure that's- to our economy. A big part of what we found is really the need for more granular data that's C. là eyes and rural but also pride like data I've would have just use the our shop you will thousand model. Of thanks. But again we had our in our day and so we have a seat see we are a little bit better shape another thing I just would point out where working with doctor merry feels group at scripts and the port of San Diego to deploy a network of sea level rise centers in San Diego bay to figure out how does that storm surge which really is actually probably the most impactful part of all of the all these impacts how does that work in a semi closed embayment as opposed to an open coastline so that'll really help us define. Those models. And then I can see at the airport we're embedding climate resilience you can climb at TI in toward the making system. So. Every little prop and jet he was ending for the team and we don't give a **** this point. Documents you know and for the feet four feet we taped thing the best a double. Time because it's get involving prop yes point it at its a critical part of our decision making process. And then I just want to point out another thing out of this little study from twenty twelve. The jurisdictions around the table that work on a real as well it really helps when sort of the on the ground practice get together. I'm sure lessons learned. And Richard is and through this this is one of the impetus for creating the sandy regional climate collaborative. I'm and now there are similar collaborative all across the state- so just one highlighted those type of. Forms where academia comes together with non profit business and public agencies because this is certainly an all hands on deck kind of problem. With that I thank you for your time thank you. Yeah great. Yeah my name's I call her and I'm with. The director Barbara county chin and I also see are aquaculture bluetec program and I mention that because it will be talking about- what mayor dina doctor about and some of our- since two sealevel rise that were working on so. The poor you probably pass along harbor drive going to the airport when you're going to and from your thanksgiving vacation- but we are San Diego bay we have see. Sec about six thousand acres around San Diego bay that we are the trustee for the state of California to manage those resources. We have about twenty two public park so come on down to visit I'm more than happy to the- we. Bob yes our water is. Bogart. And of course public and one TV along. As it. The islands around twenty eight thank Montel were first fisheries navigation wrecked environmental stewardship. It's called the penny this is. We also regularly including coastal act the port act in a lot of weeds under. Assembly six one. Which required us to look at our bone ability for sea level rise. We have a lot of plans and policy center on our website it good night time reading there we by you to take a look bad. Assembly bill six the what was. Specifically to force. Impacts kilo right look at to fix he will rise time Ms refining telling to be of. Talk steak burgers and work them to answer questions that court that was due last year. Whenever AB adaptation policies and we have me I. This is a example you have to use both kids but we also looking living or lines up that. It has in Marin only for. Tional but lends. I mean things I an instruction. Step back to be a to accommodate. Of all right. So the port is also a large partner with the US navy- we've been partnering them for decades starting with our integrated natural resources management plan which is only joint dot in the country and we also have. A random. With the V. eight ten the only be I'm- agree this the next three with AB. And local group so basically we're nay on the level rise and coast leading the bay. I wanted to. Mention as Brandon mention are- wave monitoring pilot project with scripts. And I'm personal. A lot of the work that hearing of. If you the rest of ones that will help. At sealevel rise. Trees planted in. Three but when an acting nine will have that's. So not only does it have with all right here question Gen for both wetland in yoga. I'm sick to bay has about fifty in person the bill in the state. I'm a. That the three is more. Than forest's general so. Eight eight two one six working on health under section couple years is for us in the bay are clueless the city beach on the right and a city of Saint go on left. And that is a former stock pond we want store to. Well let at a- meeting bang- in the fun from that mitigation bank with. The local community with infrastructure and jobs. In we started during current studies as we think this restoration for creating a ticket thank you be about an 89% by your to one hundred. Big see. That part because when that price for it if. We also have a cut in to be. Up. To clean we see this. So here's the part Leo I will que sure. Growing see we of cleaning up the mess in the a and a couple of projects that all dive into you. I'm. No pan into some guys dive. Do you like three D. can for as a. Using kelp kelp into corporation well we they to feed water. Gallons a day an instant also there's also carp. The we are pop culture call one eight three I am. The company that working their cell to arrest. The thing rips apple Charlie. Were hurt can hope that. May make. A rap but also make pool in missional at which will so. At Easter and also help with currency question in. Conclusion we're seeing a lot of work- to resources habitat restoration mitigation banking- in innovative technology clean aquaculture to you with carbon seek patient all help with reap billions. So thank you. Thank is somehow back on track on time so I'm sure that do you have any questions from our member legislators before we go into public. Ten questions. And in the coastal protection and I wondered what is the number there how much money are are you able to just from your own efforts are put forward towards your plan. Gives us an idea of what additional money we need it be opting for no like men that matching funds and things like that that. Are certainly. Available we if we can show that the communities to see these are doing a lot on their own- the state needs to step in and I think it also helps with a federal. Matching funds just like it does for transportation. I'm so I can answer that over the past two years we've accumulated- about five hundred thousand. Dollars in the tier to find in August two coastal zone management. I just I just like to put that out there for discussion when we get back to Sacramento that. When you cities that are stepping up to address this and there are. No the loan- Indians out there trying to you know support and protect their immunities that we should be first and foremost to advocate for them at the state. All to do a matching funds sort of program in our budget. With the fat with our federal representatives also because it is you know it's kind of show me the money for a lot of these projects that are very very important. So I just like to note that but congratulations I think when you get a local tax past that connects directly to something. An official odd to your community the buyer whatever. We have a lot of support from president. Those of us who are at. No tax an orange get went to hell in a house the house on those we had to fight to get him to pass. For our- roads budget Aston south. Tell them to support completely to help us and match us. Thank you other. Thank you madam chair one of all the presenters- it's a luxury that we don't get to have a more in session hello the latest for a long time here from all different perspectives of says the I said. Get everyone giving us so much of apple Tom. Start with the most urgent to terms the dhamma blasts and out of San data into T. wants to address this- but the funding that senator Atkins was able to secure in this year's budget- I. Was on I think I heard you say that will have- since our deliverable in next year or so have the desire. For a. The civilization five we need. Money to construct the actual piles and you get a number for what eighteen million dollars two five and six design and build an engine that would be like most projects a blend of local state federal funding of some club and that would be very happy to. Local funding into. We have the state and if it comes in not to hold you. For a specific figure today but a ballpark figure of what that be from a state perspective eighty nine million a. But that is why he's very good at what he got. The you can get then I appreciate. Willing to discuss this to the state level any money can we get to just simply do five and six to realize issue. At four twelve avoid. It will it will be much you have to look at the longer term solution that will cost more. I think you have issue saying out of forum. For the server. For this plan is on the table at again assemblymember hard discussing a lot of the citing issues there and you do not be shy minister how can put this issue obviously in a center at. People engaged. This is urgent and you are your your comment. Above for both agencies- illustrate this isn't just an inconvenience not of couple commuters on the coaster that's going to be inconvenient so that would mean to me by itself. This is truly could be catastrophic our economy. Not just locally before nation and I want act accordingly and show the kind of urgency from the state level that. Is appropriate for the service without committee you. She needs of ends up parts of the state so- thank you again at. Coming out of I just want to. Amplify that the words of you know did a great job of. Begin to something that this has been a few of the seemingly zero sum game in when we when we buy into that kind of. That I mean nothing gets done and if I think all in this room this afternoon because you believe this is an urgent issue. And any sort of still meeting of it is not beneficial I appreciate you. Taking the number things we can do- that there is broad consensus forecast what senator Bates is getting to a moment ago- and I would urge that continued focus on on those kinds of issues- informed as to what we can do and I think. Many in this room I know not everyone may realize. The to a year where- you know we collect legislative ideas and figure out priorities to address in it- and so. This is the perfect time to say you know Hey this not that. This week here this repeal their this internet legislation here- these are often while we hope these hearings at this time of year and stuff. That I think of AB wonder leave your one me what should come next immediate we- should be in contact with any of our offices saying. You know here's a legislative idea this year is a budget ask for the coming year. Or his image to repeat because it just doesn't work anymore- in the context of. Changing sea level rise so. I just put that general plea out. And then lastly of doctor Merrifield still here I think he has. A you you kind of put it. Last by which I. Because role that deliverables right a lot of this is information coming and it's fantastic but really. What can we do and ms Barnhart I. Took note of that. A substantial reduction in carbon emissions- maybe just. Of a moment at the microphone of what you might actually. Suggest we do I think we have some notions their bills up for around in the legislature. Some have been successful some have not been. From your person from your position in the professional. Background what would you like to see the state of California due to actually speak to that. Bullet point it is one one one one long but- what it. There's a lot I think we're at the point where. We appreciate we see because my we appreciate. In the. I'm really planning hi it doesn't quite have the detail we need for our sort of like- going forward in the ten twenty her oxen thinking about what we need to do now ice on these adaptive pathways stop steps so I'm I'm really in favor of expanding what we did in. Beach more communities along the coast to build in this resilient- infrastructure standing for in for predicting and for a going forward and I think more projects like that would really help community. Well we are so fortunate scripts here in San Diego I know you were because beyond just our our county limits will grateful that you're here. Thank you Esperanza shall follow up on that real quick if you wouldn't mind- specifically when you said aggressive reduction of greenhouse gas emissions what were the fob top five things California can do. Next year. To achieve that bullet point. I think for California one two three four and five is transportation I mean I thought the send a presentation was right on point. We have to bill communities were doing or what were we doing much traveling between. Where we working where we live. I was I thought the vision. Keeper for was system that we can reach that. But that's that's the future I think for California. Yeah I think there's some. I. I think that we can do a southern cal legislators of collective. And it is we talk about cabin trade funnies pictures California their fair share we have been receiving our fair share now typically transportation dollars are are are dealt out on a population basis or rap based on your population those are. Let's go up in a pretty fair fashion but the cap and trade has not so something we need to talk about as a southern California delegation going to this next year is how do we get our fair share of cap and trade. A to address in nexus between the purpose of having trading right and what the ultimately use her. Can I give you an example this last budget. There's a hundred million dollars- from cabinetry on ongoing committed on an ongoing basis to the Central Valley. To provide clean water. For there's no nexus between the purpose of the cap and trade dollars and clean water doesn't mean that clean water is not needed. But that's really a general fund expenditure that should not be a cap and trade expenditure that the legislature- committed to so those are the kinds of dynamics that we could walk. Watch for as we head into next year fair share and making sure that the dollars are spent. In a- fashion. Did you have a specific thing sure. Following climate change since nineteen ninety nine when I did a face some climate change could you please identify yourself yes I I'm Christopher those don't know I mean I work with sandbags. I live in dolma. I'm I've been. Interesting climate change since the nineteen eighties when I read an article in Scientific American that alerted me to the sea level rise. Only the thesis on the subject in nineteen eighty nine. But what I've seen in the trenches here over the last twenty years working in seated in San Diego. Easily get money. For checks that. Improve the capacity of a transportation system. What's very difficult is it meant. For resiliency. And as we soaring Collins presentation the bridge St Peter. With six feet a syllable rise will be at the top of that bridge. But it's very hard to get the money to replace that bridge because- it doesn't qualify as a capacity enhancing project. It's an old bridge. That is not resilient. And said my appeal to you as a group of that. This is trying to make some. Money available for transportation resiliency. As opposed to always saying you have to increase service so you have to. In a move more people we can't move any painful if the bridges on the war. Well the bluffs files a. Many for resistance is might flee. Thank you. Thank you. I wanna I wanna thank everybody removed public comment of them. You know when we get that impact. That assembly member Gloria was talking about for justifying the del Mar blast. I think one number that I see clearly from today's presentation hopefully all took that with the two. Is the impact and goods and services it would be if the del Mar blasts. Not available are the dump the. To the del Mar is not available so you know if we if you that number please share with us now but otherwise the idea right now but we have the economic impact. Of goods movement in the region we can make that inviolable to. Hey guests thing is to be with us today talking about how do we preserve what's wonderful about our coastline. But really faced allergies of the next hundred years and level right. Arm you know I a one I think all the agencies that are here today I want to thank my team. Cecilia Montez my legislative director she is a veteran of the building and I she was the one who is primarily responsible this so let's give the some jazz hands Visalia. With Claudia Espinoza from my team we have Alex he won my district director heather Conklin is somewhere my chief of staff rob Charles a somewhere Fernando is the- you know he's actually feel right for Mister- and our fifth wheel right for Oceanside but he actually with. The V. today's a good job in and out- and so made it all work I wasn't really clear about that- it when I when I pull this all together. What I hear is four main things. We need to pursue pursuit aggressive reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. And that means it's gonna be a change in our way of life. And changing aye. Cations first many years changes so hard for folks except. But if we want a planet for our children we're just going to embrace it. And waste well through it together I really. Appreciate surge dina. Caught let's get away from talking and retreat and talk about what are the adaptation strategies we can agree on- because with our science is changing so much. You know the second thing is I heard was. The more Deventer if it data driven modeling and I think what we've heard of scripts is doing a really great job we have spending for resiliency. I think what I want to thank the port and the airport authority in sand act and see TV I know you guys are on the frontline of this and I really think the airport a thought for how you present in it and she but it's possible- to plan for it- the last thing is- our second to last two things- we do need to move to action. Some of the actions for funding some of that action is policies- echo the sentiments assembly member Gloria now is the time we're putting together our build cages budget asks this is when we need to come together- do like I really pushed under Bates about asking funds- cities who are committing and putting. Their get in the game let's see what how can help them I think we see coastal cities when this arm know that every he has the capacity so how do we have the equity component in it- and I do see Coronado and AB are probably really on the frontline what we're gonna do. And I really urge you are any five and you have to fight traffic. Down or we can go have dinner. Make a little. Later and so when we look at this. We have a- board together this is the first of many hearings. I think it's really important we're starting here we're gonna do them throughout the state. She keeps I want to take of an. We do things assembly touched up but up her feet here looked at. An thank you assemblymember are owed being here we heard that Long Beach is already been experience as we know we saw those maps about Ventura thing in the bay area we know this is how. Eight and we moving forward that said we have fifteen minutes. Want to public comment you can line up if they're more than fifteen people you get thirty seconds if there's less than fifty people you get a minute. So please calm line up for public comment. As we do have to and five I'm sorry. Serve only five people line up you each get three minutes. Going now. There's people lined up you get five minutes is all works. I'll try to be brief okay thank you so much for your name for the record. Look I live in Cardiff. Not on the beach. Access. Some comments on some things that were said today in the last month and things were said to the- and- treat is never going to. The Xin is gonna take far longer than I have. I was suggested legislature get the coastal commission off that page. Suggest that you look at other areas of the country not and also in Europe. I grew up in New England where they've been fighting. Coastal erosion for over a hundred fifty years in winning. At any of that stuff here and I think we need to look outside of California for some answers- I used to take the closer to work in downtown San Diego stopped. Partly because he took an hour and a half extra than driving. And also up in that bluff is scared of these a salary I was in government and transportation for forty odd years. Looking at subway systems around the world. I would. Get off the bluffs fast as possible not miles inland because it that's what we're. Cutting over of one a one three del Mar. The be inconvenient for. But that's house somewhere well to Boston. Bill Tom. Right now I'm- right wing more earthquakes and we do. It's you know something needs to be done now- I've noticed in the standard budget there's been no money even the study some of the stuff for the last five years I suggest that. Thank you final. In is something that was only mentioned I also lived in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon Washington and British coal all have. Marked he wished includes. Because to not to do have king tides to have. I seen one sign in California. Is the holy shores at the beach. And then it doesn't tell you where to go it just says evacuation. This evacuation routes effective. Are clearly marked are free of impediments. And even having in washing safer volcanoes. As you a mountaineers their. The obvious choice for your like Leucadia and other parts of its a need just up and down the coast. What used to be one of. Nothing was state the state dropped no one is a highway. Because if anything happens and I five you have no back up. Living in Washington where a truck damage to bridge for six months. And they had to go on ninety nine which is equivalent up there. We don't have that back up. One on one would be the evacuation route strips gaping it's going to kill people. If you look at the paradise fire. When the main says of death. According to the LA times poll. Is that they'd street scape the main. Have any out of the town. People are trapped in their cars. We can't afford that here we need to be respectful for everyone and not for the convenience of a few. Thank you thank you so much you have two minutes. Good afternoon thank you so much for hosting this a hearing was very informative and Tara I know I appreciate that my name sherry mac and former council member for the city of Oceanside Oceanside resident in here today representing the citizens. Of the press parks and beaches something that is very dear to our. What I if at all possible I've been to several hearings and if you're here it's great you can absorb the information. However if you're not here trying to track down. The data the power point presentations all that great information you have to go to each agency and Hutton pack what are the possible that you could consider having a link to all the information that present. Possibly on Facebook page so that'd make it easy for the public. Said just said it will be on my website awesome I thank you so much. Hello my name my. Charlie McDermott insists for. I want to raise two points of a start some macro points the drill down to something that's that's really critical particularly for Anthony this. No California's very blessed we have. Probably mild climate compared to let's say New Hampshire we don't have ice storms we don't have to re pave the roads every three years- and we also have a massive tax base to hear there's no money the money there's no money the state has extremely high taxes. And there's potentially no meaningful infrastructure spending the state for near the century the greatest. Leucadia should not be flooding that's not sea level rise that's a rain storm and if you look at the data that was presented today. We haven't even headed to the point of significant sea level rise. We are just reaping. The seeds that we so inaction in maintaining reasonable infastructure for first will country Nicaragua has better drainage to locate a. And I think the issue to me is getting. Is caught up day to some of these very pressing issues. Which are very glad that was shown that's coastal erosion that's a massive collapse at a public beach where people and kids play in senators didn't lose three people at loss for people in the last ten years. And I live right in the KDE. That blood is full time I am shocked we four people have been killed. And what I recommend is. You guys have to support these now you have to at least I'll property owners to support their property with homes. And see walls and drainage. Or whatever it needs to be done instead of a tax. Threatening them having a life guard spying take pictures because you've been guided by. Rather. Problems playing box falling you killing people on the beach this is happening now and it's going to happen and I just went out there yesterday I saw about five hundred pound chunk that didn't come to wave action is because rainstorm and it fell down so I recommend private property owners be allowed to responsibly manage their boss without being attacked is right now no one's touching anything. And I think the access points do you think they should have more action concert. Tragedy in the light stamp right in front of the very small seat. This the safe. Going here he has put rocks in front read that it stands you will not while private property up to do right behind the massive retaining wall. From falling into the back of this. And round here anyone else because if you have a vertical near vertical slope and you're a lot of rain you could have a revision and then you get have collapsed. Think if he thank you.
