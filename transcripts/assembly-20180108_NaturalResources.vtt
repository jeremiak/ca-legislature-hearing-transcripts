LESS.

00:32:17.436 --> 00:32:20.138 region:rollup2
THIS IS LESS THAN A LEADER

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.373 region:rollup2

BEVERAGE AND SO THREE NINETEEN

00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:39.491 region:rollup2
IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:40.258 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE REALITY OF THE

00:32:39.491 --> 00:32:42.527 region:rollup2
TYPE OF BEVERAGES THAT ARE

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:42.894 region:rollup2

YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WE HAVE EIGHTY

00:32:49.568 --> 00:32:52.003 region:rollup2
SEVEN PERCENT OF THE BOTTLES

00:32:51.236 --> 00:32:53.038 region:rollup2
THAT COME BAGGED DO HAVE THEIR

00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:54.706 region:rollup2

00:32:53.038 --> 00:32:56.908 region:rollup2
THREE FOURTHS OF THOSE THAT COME

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:04.449 region:rollup2
BE DONE CLEARLY BUT WE. DON'T WE

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:05.717 region:rollup2
CAN'T SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IF WE

00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:08.086 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO

00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:08.987 region:rollup2
IT. TETHER TAPS GENERALLY IN

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:10.989 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PRODUCTS WOULD

00:33:08.987 --> 00:33:13.425 region:rollup2
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PLASTIC WHICH

00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:16.528 region:rollup2
IS CONTRARY TOMORROW THE OVERALL

00:33:13.425 --> 00:33:18.597 region:rollup2
GOAL OF TRYING HAVE LESS INTO

00:33:16.528 --> 00:33:21.633 region:rollup2
OUR WAY STREET. AND SO UNTIL WE

00:33:18.597 --> 00:33:24.503 region:rollup2
FIND OUT WHETHER IF IT'S A

00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:28.707 region:rollup2
TETHER TAP LIKE ON THE GLEE.

00:33:24.503 --> 00:33:31.209 region:rollup2
CRYSTAL GEYSER CAP A CUSTOMER.

00:33:28.707 --> 00:33:32.310 region:rollup2
COULD STILL HAVE THE TOP RUBBING

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:33.111 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEIR NOSE OR THEIR

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.479 region:rollup2
MOUTH AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT

00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:35.413 region:rollup2
WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM SIMPLY

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:36.648 region:rollup2
ON* THAT AND I STILL HAVING

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:38.049 region:rollup2
THE SAME PROBLEM THAT WE STARTED

00:33:36.648 --> 00:33:38.984 region:rollup2
OFF WITH. SO WE HAVE BEEN TRYING

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:41.653 region:rollup2
TO WORK IN THAT INDUSTRY IS NOT

00:33:38.984 --> 00:33:43.755 region:rollup2
LIKE WE'VE IGNORED THIS PROBLEM

00:33:41.653 --> 00:33:45.790 region:rollup2
AND WE DIE FOR YOUR OP NO VOTE

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:46.291 region:rollup2
ON THIS BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:49.060 region:rollup2
SIMPLY AS AN.

00:33:46.291 --> 00:33:50.095 region:rollup2
IF.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.830 region:rollup2
MR TURN MEMBERS BOB BACK ON

NOT TO BE REDUNDANT FOR THE

00:33:54.633 --> 00:33:57.302 region:rollup2
VERY EXCELLENT TESTIMONY FROM I

00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:58.603 region:rollup2
AM I MISS PIGGY ABOUT THE

00:33:57.302 --> 00:33:59.804 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF THE BILL SO THE P. R.

00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:01.606 region:rollup2
C. C. IS DEDICATED TO. A

BOTTLES AND THE CAPS.

00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:08.280 region:rollup2
THERE A NUMBER OF ISSUES A WITH

00:34:07.646 --> 00:34:09.347 region:rollup2
THIS MANDATED IT CERTAINLY IS

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.782 region:rollup2
BEING A PREMATURE IN TERMS OF

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:12.884 region:rollup2
ITS IMPACT ON A VERY WIDE RANGE

00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:14.786 region:rollup2
OF BEVERAGES. AND IS THE AB LAID

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:16.254 region:rollup2
OUT A TALK ABOUT CARBONATION.

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:17.789 region:rollup2
AND THE IMPACT ON THAT CAP THEY

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:18.957 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THE TETHER IT COULD

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:21.159 region:rollup2
INVOLVE PLASTICS THAT ARE NOT

00:34:18.957 --> 00:34:23.328 region:rollup2
COMPATIBLE WITH PT RECYCLING SO

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:24.429 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUTTHE IMPACT ON.

00:34:23.328 --> 00:34:25.964 region:rollup2
THE OTHER COSTS RECYCLING THE

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.998 region:rollup2
BILLY TO OFFICIALLY RECYCLE A

TECHNOLOGY FOR AN UNKNOWN RANGE

00:34:30.135 --> 00:34:33.872 region:rollup2
OF PRODUCTS THAT WE THINK IT'S

00:34:31.403 --> 00:34:34.806 region:rollup2
PREMATURE.

00:34:33.872 --> 00:34:36.107 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT THAT UP

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:36.875 region:rollup2
VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF

00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:37.375 region:rollup2

00:34:36.875 --> 00:34:39.611 region:rollup2
A CAPS

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:40.312 region:rollup2
A FIXED.

00:34:39.611 --> 00:34:41.980 region:rollup2
WE SURELY WOULD ENCOURAGE

00:34:40.312 --> 00:34:42.547 region:rollup2
GREATER PUBLIC OUTREACH TO

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.615 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO JUST

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:44.482 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:46.184 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD CERTAINLY

00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:48.086 region:rollup2
ADDRESS A A LARGER PORTION

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:49.387 region:rollup2

00:35:55.286 --> 00:36:00.825 region:rollup2
FROM MEMBERS.

00:35:58.223 --> 00:36:01.760 region:rollup2
MR. ON CAN I ASK THE PROPONENTS

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:04.062 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:06.097 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY OR LACK THEREOF.

00:36:04.062 --> 00:36:09.034 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK THAT'S.

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:10.702 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A GROWING.

00:36:09.034 --> 00:36:11.803 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF IDEAS TECHNOLOGIES

00:36:10.702 --> 00:36:12.837 region:rollup2
THAT ARE COMING FORWARD THAT I

00:36:11.803 --> 00:36:14.406 region:rollup2
THINK WILL SOLVE THAT THEIR

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:15.306 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:36:14.406 --> 00:36:17.008 region:rollup2
I HAD MET WITH THE INDUSTRY WHEN

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:18.943 region:rollup2
WE INTRODUCED THIS BILL LAST

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:20.545 region:rollup2
YEAR AND THEY WERE IN FACT

00:36:18.943 --> 00:36:22.147 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR TIME LINES. I HAVE

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:23.248 region:rollup2
NOT HEARD FROM THEM WHAT AT WHAT

00:36:22.147 --> 00:36:24.816 region:rollup2
A REALISTIC TIME I WOULD BE AND

00:36:23.248 --> 00:36:26.151 region:rollup2
I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO TO TALK

00:36:24.816 --> 00:36:27.652 region:rollup2
TO THEM ABOUT THAT WE WE PUT A

00:36:26.151 --> 00:36:29.220 region:rollup2
STAKE IN THE GROUND. HAS OF

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:31.089 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY TO REALLY TRY AND

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.724 region:rollup2
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. IF THEY'RE

00:36:31.089 --> 00:36:34.025 region:rollup2
CLOSE IF THEY NEED A LITTLE BIT

00:36:32.724 --> 00:36:34.526 region:rollup2
MORE TIME I THINK THAT'S FINE

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:36.861 region:rollup2
BUT YOU WE'VE SEEN SOME

00:36:34.526 --> 00:36:38.096 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES.

00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:39.764 region:rollup2
WHERE OTHERS HAVE COME UP WITH

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:42.033 region:rollup2
THAT OR NOT INDUSTRY HAVE COME

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:44.602 region:rollup2
UP WITH SOLUTIONS THAT ARE

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:46.204 region:rollup2
TETHERED THAT USE LESS PLASTIC

00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:49.641 region:rollup2
WERE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME FORM?

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:51.609 region:rollup2
OF OF CAP AS OTHERS THAT ARE

00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:53.344 region:rollup2
VERY LIKELY TO BE OF THE THROUGH

00:36:51.609 --> 00:36:54.479 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING SHIRI THAT IS OUT

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:56.281 region:rollup2
THERE MEAN THESE MACHINES ARE

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:58.917 region:rollup2
TURNING OVER PRODUCTS. ZILLIONS

00:36:56.281 --> 00:37:00.752 region:rollup2
OF PRODUCTS IN EVERY DAY.

00:36:58.917 --> 00:37:02.387 region:rollup2
AND SO A A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD

00:37:00.752 --> 00:37:03.321 region:rollup2
NEED TO WORK WITH OBVIOUSLY THE

00:37:02.387 --> 00:37:04.889 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S THAT'S

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:06.825 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN PLACE.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:08.293 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE ARE GOOD IDEAS THAT

00:37:06.825 --> 00:37:09.627 region:rollup2
ARE COMING FROM PLACES THAT ARE

00:37:08.293 --> 00:37:10.762 region:rollup2
NOT WELL FUNDED THEY DON'T HAVE

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:12.163 region:rollup2
MUCH INCENTIVE OTHER THAN THAT A

00:37:10.762 --> 00:37:14.532 region:rollup2
REDUCTION I THINK THE INDUSTRY

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:15.834 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY. CAN MOVE TO BE ABLE

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:17.736 region:rollup2
TO FIT HER TO TAKE ONE OF THE

00:37:15.834 --> 00:37:20.171 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS OR COME UP WITH ONE OF

00:37:17.736 --> 00:37:21.439 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN. SO I'D I DISPUTE THAT

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:22.507 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGY.

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:24.342 region:rollup2
I THINK THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE

00:37:22.507 --> 00:37:25.844 region:rollup2
THERE OR ARE CLOSE AND THEIR

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:27.912 region:rollup2
ENOUGH EXAMPLES TO BE ABLE TO

00:37:25.844 --> 00:37:30.215 region:rollup2
DRAW FROM TO BEN PUT THIS

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:33.885 region:rollup2
PROCESS ON A REALISTIC TIME LINE

00:37:30.215 --> 00:37:35.086 region:rollup2
AND GET US. THE BOTTLE CAPS TO

00:37:33.885 --> 00:37:36.755 region:rollup2
OTHER. I UNDERSTAND IT WAS A

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:37.889 region:rollup2
BILL SIMILAR BILL INTRODUCED IN

00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:40.692 region:rollup2
A TWO THOUSAND NINE THEREABOUTS.

00:37:37.889 --> 00:37:41.993 region:rollup2
R. AB NINE TWENTY FIVE SO. R..

00:37:40.692 --> 00:37:43.228 region:rollup2
THE BILL WAS HOLDING THE SENATE

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:45.797 region:rollup2
THOUGH WHAT WAS THE REASON WAS

00:37:43.228 --> 00:37:47.332 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE OF A TECHNOLOGY OR

00:37:45.797 --> 00:37:48.967 region:rollup2
LACK THEREOF AS WELL THAT. I AM

00:37:47.332 --> 00:37:51.236 region:rollup2
NOT SURE WHY THAT WAS HELD IN

00:37:48.967 --> 00:37:52.470 region:rollup2
THE SENATE THERE ALSO HAS BEEN

00:37:51.236 --> 00:37:53.805 region:rollup2
IF YOU GO BACK FAR ENOUGH.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.607 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT CAP MATERIAL WAS

00:37:53.805 --> 00:37:57.275 region:rollup2
NOT QUITE ROUTE IS RECYCLABLE AS

00:37:55.607 --> 00:37:58.843 region:rollup2
THE AS THE P. ET.

00:37:57.275 --> 00:38:00.512 region:rollup2
THEY. THE BOTTLES THEMSELVES NOW

00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:02.046 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT TRUE THEY

00:38:00.512 --> 00:38:04.048 region:rollup2
CAN CHOP UP THE PRODUCT IS A

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:05.784 region:rollup2
COMES IN AND THE CAT MATERIAL

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:07.152 region:rollup2
FLOATS SO THEY CAN BE SKIMMED

00:38:05.784 --> 00:38:08.887 region:rollup2
OFF. SO RECYCLERS ARE NOW

00:38:07.152 --> 00:38:09.787 region:rollup2
WANTING TO GET THE CAPS BACK

00:38:08.887 --> 00:38:11.556 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S RECYCLABLE

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:13.424 region:rollup2
PRODUCT AS WELL SO THAT'S TAKEN

00:38:11.556 --> 00:38:15.059 region:rollup2
AWAY THAT THIS NOTION THAT THE

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:16.094 region:rollup2
RECYCLERS DIDN'T REALLY WANT THE

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:17.562 region:rollup2
CAPS THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD.

00:38:16.094 --> 00:38:18.396 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO DO WITH.

00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:19.664 region:rollup2
WITH THE ISSUE THAT THAT BILL

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:21.566 region:rollup2
HAD BACK THEN BUT THIS IS RIGHT

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:22.500 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:38:21.566 --> 00:38:24.068 region:rollup2
THEIR CYCLES CAN CERTAINLY

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.836 region:rollup2
HANDLE THE PRODUCT WANT THE

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:26.805 region:rollup2
PRODUCT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S

00:38:24.836 --> 00:38:28.573 region:rollup2
VALUABLE RECYCLABLE PRODUCT IN

00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:30.074 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE CAPS

00:38:28.573 --> 00:38:31.676 region:rollup2
ARE COMING BACK THE BOTS.

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:33.478 region:rollup2
CAN I ALSO ASK THE OPPONENT JUST

00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:34.712 region:rollup2
ISSUE OFF OUT OF TECHNOLOGY IN

00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:36.414 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS TIME FRAME IS

00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:39.450 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WINDY EXPECTS THAT GO

00:38:36.414 --> 00:38:40.785 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE. AVAIL

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.953 region:rollup2
GRATEFUL.

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:43.021 region:rollup2
MR SHALL ALL THE COMPANIES ARE

00:38:41.953 --> 00:38:43.688 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENTLY WORKING ON IT

00:38:43.021 --> 00:38:44.856 region:rollup2
THEIR FEARS COMPARED PET

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:46.591 region:rollup2
COMPETITORS IN THE MARKETPLACE

00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:48.626 region:rollup2
SO IT IS JUST BECAUSE EVERYONE

00:38:46.591 --> 00:38:50.161 region:rollup2
ON THE OUTSIDE DOESN'T SEE A

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:51.362 region:rollup2
SAMPLING IT. THAT'S NOT TO SAY

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:52.964 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT GOING ON AND THEY

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:54.632 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN A LOT OF TIMES WILL

00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:56.401 region:rollup2
HAVE A PROTOTYPE THAT MIGHT WORK

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:57.435 region:rollup2
IT ORIGINALLY BUT AFTER IT'S

00:38:56.401 --> 00:38:59.737 region:rollup2
BEEN TESTED.

00:38:57.435 --> 00:39:01.139 region:rollup2
SHELF LIFE ONESELF WITH BALLS

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:02.640 region:rollup2
OFF THE SHELF IN THOSE KIND OF

00:39:01.139 --> 00:39:04.742 region:rollup2
THINGS AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THE

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.412 region:rollup2
UMPS SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AT THE

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:09.247 region:rollup2
FDA REQUIRES OF US SO THE LONG

00:39:07.412 --> 00:39:10.915 region:rollup2
TERM EVEN IF WE HAD A PROTOTYPE

00:39:09.247 --> 00:39:12.717 region:rollup2
FOR FRANCE'S COCA COLA. ARE

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:14.285 region:rollup2
BIGGER PRODUCER IF WE HAD A

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:16.120 region:rollup2
PROTOTYPE THAT WAS READY TO GO

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:17.222 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW TO GET IT IN ALL THEIR

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.090 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION STRAINED IT WOULD

00:39:17.222 --> 00:39:20.058 region:rollup2
TAKE EIGHT TO TEN YEARS FOR THEM

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.560 region:rollup2
TO GET OUT THERE AND HAVE IT ON

00:39:20.058 --> 00:39:24.863 region:rollup2
THE SHELF. AND THAT'S IF YOU

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.331 region:rollup2
HAVE ONE THAT'S HOT FEEL RECALL

00:39:24.863 --> 00:39:28.967 region:rollup2
FILLED TO BE ABLE TO TEST IT OUT

00:39:26.331 --> 00:39:30.235 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WON'T ALWAYS WORK THE

00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:33.004 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME YOU DO IT YOU HAVE TO

00:39:30.235 --> 00:39:34.439 region:rollup2
GO BACK. INTEMPERATE IN THAT'S

00:39:33.004 --> 00:39:38.910 region:rollup2
THE TIMEFRAME THEY PROVIDED FOR

00:39:34.439 --> 00:39:41.913 region:rollup2
ME EIGHT EIGHT TO TEN YEARS

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:43.147 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOVERNMENT PROVIDING.

00:39:41.913 --> 00:39:46.684 region:rollup2
THE WORK WILL GO TO MISTER FLOOR

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:47.852 region:rollup2
ON YOUR.

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:48.786 region:rollup2
I GOT MORE THAN THE GODDESSES.

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:49.287 region:rollup2
REITERATE.

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:49.887 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE INDUSTRY'S

00:39:49.287 --> 00:39:50.688 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE WHAT WOULD BE A

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:52.323 region:rollup2
REASONABLE TIMEFRAME TO GET THIS

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:53.558 region:rollup2
DONE AND IF YOU.

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:54.459 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORED MENTIONED YOU KNOW

00:39:53.558 --> 00:39:55.593 region:rollup2
OF AN ACCEPTABLE TIME FOR WHAT

00:39:54.459 --> 00:39:56.661 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT BE FOR YOU FOLKS.

00:39:55.593 --> 00:39:57.795 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS A MISTER FOR IS

00:39:56.661 --> 00:39:58.429 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T

00:39:57.795 --> 00:40:00.265 region:rollup2
NOW RIGHT SO WE DON'T HAVE A

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:02.400 region:rollup2
PROTOTYPE THAT HAS NOW. BEEN.

00:40:00.265 --> 00:40:03.268 region:rollup2
SHOWN TO WORK ONE HUNDRED

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.903 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE TIME BEEN

00:40:03.268 --> 00:40:05.503 region:rollup2
RELIABLE HAVE THE TAMPER

00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:07.505 region:rollup2
RESISTANT.

00:40:05.503 --> 00:40:10.208 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS THAT WE NORMALLY

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:12.543 region:rollup2
NEED FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SO.

00:40:10.208 --> 00:40:13.845 region:rollup2
IT IS HARD TO SAY YOU KNOW HARD

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:15.647 region:rollup2
CORE WE CAN DO THIS IN X. EUROPE

00:40:13.845 --> 00:40:17.615 region:rollup2
WE HAD A PROTOTYPE IN ONLY

00:40:15.647 --> 00:40:19.617 region:rollup2
QUESTION WOULD BE CHANGING OVER

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:20.485 region:rollup2
MACHINERY OR DOING THOSE TYPE OF

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:21.986 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE COULD GIVE YOU A

00:40:20.485 --> 00:40:23.554 region:rollup2
HARD DAY. BUT WE DON'T HAVE

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:25.256 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AND THEN EVEN IF YOU

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:26.824 region:rollup2
HAVE ONE PROTOTYPE THAT'S

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:28.126 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE JUST WHAT'S JUST FOR

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:30.094 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT'S SAKE SAY THAT THAT

00:40:28.126 --> 00:40:32.096 region:rollup2
EXISTS. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:34.098 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE APPROVING POLICY

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:36.934 region:rollup2
THAT ONLY BENEFITS ONE COMPANY

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:38.269 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS NOT USUALLY A PLACE

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:39.871 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE LIKE SERBIA

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:41.806 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING A

00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:43.474 region:rollup2
WINDFALL FOR ONE COMPANY THAT

00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:44.676 region:rollup2
EVERYONE OUT OF ALL THE BUT THE

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:46.110 region:rollup2
BEVERAGES THAT WE PRODUCE IN THE

00:40:44.676 --> 00:40:48.279 region:rollup2
STATE. WOULD HAVE TO GO TO ONE

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:51.316 region:rollup2
COMPANY TO PRODUCE IT'S TOPS AND

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:52.550 region:rollup2
THAT JUST IS NOT A SPLIT GOOD

00:40:51.316 --> 00:40:53.451 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY IN THAT SPACE.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.787 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS NO.

00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:57.288 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SMALLER

00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:57.922 region:rollup2
COMPANIES A LOT OF THESE ETHNIC

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:59.390 region:rollup2
DRINKS THAT YOU SEE IN SOME OF

00:40:57.922 --> 00:41:01.092 region:rollup2
SMALLER SUPERMARKETS IN THE

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:02.026 region:rollup2
LARGER CUP THERE'S NO.

00:41:01.092 --> 00:41:03.561 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT EXEMPT FROM THIS

00:41:02.026 --> 00:41:05.697 region:rollup2
BILL CORRECT THEY'RE NOT AND SO

00:41:03.561 --> 00:41:07.265 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A PRODUCT THAT MAY

00:41:05.697 --> 00:41:08.433 region:rollup2
BE AN ASIAN PRODUCT OR SOMEONE

00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:09.133 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FROM ONE OF OUR LATIN

00:41:08.433 --> 00:41:10.668 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES.

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:11.736 region:rollup2
IF THEY CANNOT COME INTO THE

00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:13.604 region:rollup2
STATE WOULD BE ABLE BE ABLE TO

00:41:11.736 --> 00:41:15.440 region:rollup2
BE SOLD AND SOME ARE SMALL

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:16.841 region:rollup2
ETHNIC STORES ON BECAUSE THEY

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.076 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T COMPLY WITH THAT WITH

00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:20.845 region:rollup2
THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THANK

00:41:18.076 --> 00:41:22.313 region:rollup2
YOU.

HEAR ALL THE TESTIMONY.

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:30.088 region:rollup2
AND I CAN I THINK YOU'RE JUST

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:31.122 region:rollup2
FIGURE BECAUSE THIS IS THE

00:41:30.088 --> 00:41:34.158 region:rollup2
PROTOTYPE RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS

00:41:31.122 --> 00:41:35.226 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A PROTOTYPE IT'S.

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:37.095 region:rollup2
READY TO GO. CORRECT DOWN.

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:38.796 region:rollup2
.

00:41:37.095 --> 00:41:40.198 region:rollup2
IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU

I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS

00:41:48.006 --> 00:41:49.540 region:rollup2
TODAY IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

00:41:49.307 --> 00:41:52.777 region:rollup2
WHERE.

TO TAKE A STAND ON LETTER BOTTLE

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:56.941 region:rollup2
CAPS REGARDLESS OF THE

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:58.843 region:rollup2
STATISTICS ARE STILL. ONE OF THE

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:59.811 region:rollup2
TOP TEN THIRD FIFTH DEPENDING ON

00:42:58.843 --> 00:43:01.946 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU COUNTED ITEMS THAT ARE
