PLEASE SUBMIT IT TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE WEBSITE. SO WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD BEGIN WITH THEIR FIRST AUTHOR SO OUR FIRST ITEM IS ITEM NUMBER ONE SB THREE SIXTY FIVE BY CENTER CABELLO. I SEE SHE'S AT THE PODIUM WELCOME. GO AHEAD PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB THREE SIXTY FIVE. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE MEDICAL TO REIMBURSE ALL PARTIES PARTICIPATING PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. FOR ECON SALT SERVICES INCLUDING THOSE WHO OPERATE OUT OF IT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CLINICS WERE RURAL HEALTH CLINIC. IT CONSULT SERVICES ARE TRULY A PATIENT CENTERED INNOVATION. WHEN A PATIENT HAS A NON URGENT QUESTION A CONDITION REQUIRING SPECIALTY CARE. THEY ALLOW ONE PROVIDER USUALLY A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER TO SEND ELECTRONIC CONSPIRED SOLD TO ANOTHER PROVIDER WHO IS USUALLY A SPECIALIST. THE SPECIALIST THEN GIVES THE RESPONSE TO THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND IT COULD VERY FROM WANTING TO SEE THE PATIENT IN PERSON. TO RECOMMENDING A PRESCRIPTION OR COURSE OF CARE. ECON SOLD OFFERED TIMELY RESOLUTIONS FOR PATIENTS WHO MAY NOT OTHERWISE. BE ABLE TO WAIT WEEKS OR MONTHS TO SEE A SPECIALIST FOR SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT REQUIRE AN APPOINTMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE. CURRENTLY EACH CONSULT SERVICES ARE REIMBURSABLE FOR PROVIDERS AT THE DISTANT SITE AND THESE ARE USUALLY THE SPECIALIST PROVIDERS HOWEVER THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AT THE ORIGINATING SITE IS NOT ABLE TO BILL. FOR THIS TELEHEALTH. CONSULT BOTH PROVIDERS BRING EXPERTISE IN INFORMATION TO THE TABLE WHEN DISCUSSING THE PATIENT'S CONDITION BUT ONLY THIS SPECIALIST IS REIMBURSED FOR THEIR TIME. IN FACT IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN IS GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND BY EACH CONSULTATION WITH THE SPECIALIST. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PATIENT IS EVENTUALLY REFERRED IF THE PATIENT IS REFERRED FOR AN APPOINTMENT THE SPECIALIST NOW HAS BACKGROUND ON THE PATIENT'S CONDITION. AND THE VISIT WILL BE WELL SPENT ON NEXT STEPS INSTEAD OF INFORMATION GATHERING. AND IF NO REFERRAL IS NEEDED THEN THE PATIENT WILL HAVE THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED WITHIN. WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. EITHER OF THESE OUTCOMES BENEFIT THE PATIENT MORE THAN A SIMPLE REFERRAL WITH NO PROVIDER TO PER. TO PROVIDER CONAND- THIS SHOULD BE A GREAT BUT TO RURAL RESIDENTS WERE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN GENERAL HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING ISSUE. IN RURAL DISTRICTS IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR GENERAL PRACTITIONER AT THE LOCAL CLINIC LET ALONE A SPECIALIST WHO MAY BE HOURS AWAY. DATA INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS DO NOT SEEK FOLLOW UP SPECIALIST CARE BECAUSE OF TRANSPORTATION AND CHILD CARE CHALLENGES. APART FROM EVERYTHING ELSE USE OF ANY CONSULT WOULD DETERMINE IF A PHYSICAL VISIT IS IN FACT NEEDED SAVING RURAL PATIENTS TIME MONEY AND ANXIETY. SB THREE SIXTY FIVE IS A SMALL CHANGE TO THE BILLABLE TELEHEALTH SERVICES IN MEDICAL. I BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL NOT ONLY CREATE EQUITY FOR THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WILL IMPROVE CARE FOR THE PATIENTS. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. HE'S TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT I'M SORRY MISTER TURNER IS A DOCTOR WHO IS IN A MEETING WITH THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR COMMENT IN A HEALTH CENTER. AND ROBBIE FRANCESCHINI POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE BLUE PATH HEALTH WILL BE ON THE LINE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR JUST TO CLARIFY IT WAS THE SECOND TO TESTIFIED JUST FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WAS ALSO GIVING TESTIMONY YES SEARCHES FOR TECHNICAL OKAY ALL RIGHT SO- MODERATE PLEASE BRING- DANIEL ROMERO- TO. LINES PROVIDE. ON S. THREE SIXTY FIVE IN SUPPORT. DAHLE PREMIER THE LINE IS OPEN ALL RIGHT SO THAT TWO MINUTES PLEASE PLEASE BEGIN. HELLO MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN YOU TODAY TO PRESENT ON SENATE BILL THREE SIXTY FIVE WHICH REQUIRES FROM MEDICAID TO REIMBURSE ENROLLED PROVIDERS FOR EACH CONSOLE SERVICES INCLUDING ACCURACIES AND ARE YOU SEE. MY NAME IS WHAT I NEED IS NINE THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER OF CAMERON HEALTH AND IF YOU H. C. WOULD HEALTH CLINICS IN SEVENTEEN SITES ACROSS FRESNO AND MADERA COUNTIES WE SERVE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PATIENTS AND ACCOMPLISH APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PATIENT VISITS A YEAR. PART CLINICS HE CONSUL PROGRAM HAS BEEN A LIFELINE FOR EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS. PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON FOR PATIENTS TO WAIT WEEKS TO MONTHS FOR SPECIALTY APPOINTMENTS. THE ADDITION OF THE CONSUL'S HAS HELPED TO RELIEVE WAIT TIMES FOR APPOINTMENTS BY ENABLING OUR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO ACCESS SPECIALTY INPUT AND MANAGE THEIR PATIENTS CARE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN IN PERSON SPECIALTY VISIT. AYE CAMARENA IN CASES WHERE PATIENTS RECEIVED ANY CONSUL ARE PCPS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR PATIENTS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR SPECIALTY VISIT IN PATIENTS WALKED AND WALKED TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS AND HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH MANAGING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR ACCESS TO CHILD CARE TO ATTENTION THEIR SPECIALTY APPOINTMENTS HAVE REPORTED GREATER SATISFACTION WITH THEIR CARE AT THE CHALLENGES BECOME NONEXISTENT IN THIS PROGRAM. ALLOWING FOR BOTH THE PRIMARY CARE TREATING PROVIDER AND THE CONSULTING SPECIALISTS TO BILL FREE CONSULS WILL ENSURE THESE CLINICIANS GET COMPENSATED FOR TIME SPENT ON SERVICES OUTSIDE OF CLINIC VISITS. SHOULD MY COLLEAGUES AND MY CLINICS AND OTHER FQHCS ACROSS THE STATE BE ABLE TO BILL FOR ECON SOLD SEPARATELY FROM THEIR CLINIC VISITS THE STATE WOULD BE MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN INNOVATIVE CARE PRACTICES AND TECHNOLOGY ALREADY IN USE AT LARGER HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT SERVE MANY CALIFORNIANS ON COMMERCIAL PLANS. IN A YEAR WHERE PARITY AND EQUITY ARE OF CONCERN TO STAKEHOLDERS AND POLICMAKERS ALIKE I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL THREE SIXTY FIVE SB CONSUL AS A CRITICAL TOOL FOR SAFETY NET PROVIDERS SERVING OUR.

SB THREE SEVENTY ONE- PLEASE BEGIN THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB THREE SEVENTY ONE WHICH IS STATUS IS A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK WHICH BUILDS UPON EXISTING DATA EXCHANGE EFFORTS IN THE STATE. TOWARDS A MORE ROBUST HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO ACCESS PATIENT MEDICAL RECORDS AND INFORMATION IN A SAFE SECURE AND TIMELY MANNER THIS DATA EXCHANGE CAN TAKE MANY FORMS INCLUDING HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES OR H. I. EASE NATIONAL DATA EXCHANGE NETWORKS AND APP BASED EXCHANGES. THESE FORMS OF DATA EXCHANGE PROVIDE CONFIDENTIAL ACCESS TO A PATIENT'S UNIQUE MEDICAL HISTORY REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY GO FOR CARE AND ALLOWS PROVIDER TO GIVE THE PROVIDERS TO GIVE INDIVIDUALIZED CARE BASED ON THE PATIENT'S HISTORY. CALIFORNIA NEEDS A ROBUST HEALTH DATA EXCHANGE TO ACHIEVE GREATER CARE COORDINATION AND VALUE BASED CARE DUE TO GREAT ADVANCES IN DATA EXCHANGE MOST PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONNECTED HOWEVER MANY SMALL RURAL AND SAFETYNET PRACTICES LACK THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND FUNDING TO ACCESS THE SYSTEMS. WITHOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES THESE POSITIONS ARE CUT OFF FROM THE KEY FROM THE EASY EXCHANGE OF DATA BETWEEN FELLOW PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT DIRECT PATIENT ACCESS TO THEIR OWN DATA WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT. SB THREE SEVENTY ONE ADDRESSES NOT ONLY THE VALUE OF THE INTER CONNECTIVITY HIV BUT ALSO MEETS THE NEEDS OF PHYSICIANS AND PHYSICIAN PRACTICES WHERE THEY ARE ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL SPECTRUM AND HELPS TO BRING IT EQUITY TO THE SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY SB THREE SEVENTY ONE CREATES A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR H. I. E. ACCESS IN ALL MEDICAL PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE BY BUILDING SUPPORT BRIDGE WHERE IT IS NEEDED FOR SMALLER ESTABLISHMENTS THIS BILL ALSO CREATES A STREAMLINED ACTS THIS. FOR PROVIDERS TO PUBLIC HEALTH THE- AND LEVERAGES FEDERAL FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION NEEDS ADDITIONALLY SB THREE SEVENTY ONE REESTABLISHES THE ROLE OF THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. AND THE E. HEALTH COORDINATING COMMITTEE UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO FACILITATE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE AND WITH OUR FEDERAL DEPARTMENT PARTNERS.

WE STARTED THIS EFFORT AS THE TECHNOLOGY ALLOW EXCHANGING THE USERS OF THE SAME. VENDOR EHR BUT THEN WE WERE QUICKLY ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE NATIONAL. CHANGE THAT WORKING CONSTANTLY THE CAREQUALITY FRAMEWORK ALLOWS EXCHANGE BETWEEN PROVIDERS USING ANY SORT OF FIND WORK ON THE CALL RECORD. TODAY WE LEVERAGES FRAMEWORK TO STRANGE SIX MILLION PATIENT RECORDS A MONTH WITH MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND INDEPENDENT PROVIDER OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE. AND MY PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES ACTUALLY EVERY SINGLE PATIENT BUT I'VE SEEN AS EXTERNAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE AUTOMATICALLY IN THEIR RECORD- LOCALLY AND YOU'RE GOING TO WORK- POLITICAL. LITERATURE CONNECTIVITY TREMENDOUSLY VALUABLE DURING THE PANDEMIC ALLOWING US TO CHANGE COULD BE TESTING OF THAT SCENE INFORMATION. FASTER WE ALSO WERE EARLY ADOPTERS OF NEW THE NEW GATE EXCHANGE MODELS UTILIZING APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE WHICH APPLE HEALTH IS REALLY OBLIGATED TO ALLOW PATIENTS ACCESS TO THEIR OWN HEALTH DATA.

OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH MODERATOR NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THERE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN I WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK IT IS- IS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY WELL INTENTIONED AND WOULD DO A LOT OF GOOD. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I DID RECEIVE NOT OPPOSITION BUT SOME CONCERNS FROM INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH OF WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT. BUT I THINK THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AND I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PREVIOUS EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN TO ADVANCE I E. EIGHTY. H. I. E. IN CALIFORNIA HAVE FAILED TO THE LACK OF REQUIREMENTS ON HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO PARTICIPATE. STATES OF SIXTEEN SUCCESSFUL HEALTH INFORMATION LAKE MICHIGAN MARYLAND NORTH CAROLINA ALL USE SOME FORM OF STRONG LEVERAGE ON THE PROVIDERS. AS AS RECOMMENDED BY THE GOVERNOR IN HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL AND I DON'T THINK THIS BILL COVERS THAT- BUT DO YOU THINK THERE'S A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT. THE CENTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT QUESTION APPRECIATE IT I BELIEVE THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT PART OF THE CHALLENGES THE RESOURCES. IF THERE ARE. NO RESOURCES TO HELP THEM. COME INTO COMPLIANCE THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SET UP A STRUCTURE RESET YOU GOTTA DO IT. AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT COST YOU TO DO IT AND SO WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO THROUGH THIS IS TO SET UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE GOING TO BE HOW MUCH MONEY IT'S GOING TO TAKE AND THEN WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO. MAKE IT HAPPEN SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS IS A WORK IN PROSPEROUS. GET THE SENATE HEALTHCARE. THANK YOU SIR EGGMAN. THANK YOU MUCH S. R. KOREA AND NOT. THAT I THINK IS A GOOD BILL AND I THINK IT'S GETTING OUT OF. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AROUND. ASH ACCESS AND EQUITY WHICH IS. A WHICH IS WHAT WE HOW WE LEAD WITH OUR VALUES. I AM. I TOOK MY- I AM. ON CLOSING MY- I PUT MY LICENSE BACK ON TRACK JUST SO I. HAD TO TAKE SOME SEE. AND SO I THOUGHT I SHOULD TAKE SOMETHING ON TELEHEALTH- ANYWAY I GUESS I JUST HAD NO IDEA OF THE CONNECTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED ON BOTH SIDES. OF BOTH THE RECEIVER- AS WELL AS THE PROVIDER. AND THE ALL POLL ALL I THINK ALL OF WHAT YOU DON'T SEE IN FRONT THAT GOES BEHIND THE SCENES IN MAKING THAT ENTIRE SYSTEM BE ABLE TO WORK. SO THAT THE- THE CLIENT AND THE PROVIDERS- ARE HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION AND ARE ABLE TO- INNER INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER SO- I THINK IS A GOOD BILL AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. ABSOLUTELY I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. ALL RIGHT THE NEW BY CENTER EGGMAN AT THE PERFECT TIME- CENTER WIENER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- I ALSO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR. A BRING FORWARD I DO WHICH IS TO QUESTIONS TO THE AUTHOR MISTER CHAIRMAN YES PLEASE. I'M THE FIRST ONE IS THERE'S A OPPOSITION UNLESS AMENDED LETTER FROM. ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION ABOUT SOME PRIVACY ISSUES JUST READING THAT LETTER. IT SEEMS LIKE. SHE'S A PERHAPS COULD BE WORKED THROUGH AND I'M JUST. WONDERING TO THE AUTHOR YOU- RESPONSES IN CONVERSATION. WITH EFF TO SEE WHAT CAN BE WORKED OUT WE WILL BE IN CONVERSATIONS THIS IS JUST THE FIRST STEP AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT THAT CONVERSATION IT. UP BY THE APPRECIATE THE ACCESS CAN BE ANALYZED AND VIEWED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN EQUITY THE SAME WAY SO YES. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO THAT. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN THE SECOND QUESTION IS HAS TO DO WITH- DATA COLLECTION AROUND. A DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUES ONE THING THAT. HAS COME INTO FULL SHINING LIGHT DURING COVE IT. IS THAT WE DON'T- HEALTH CARE SYSTEM- DOES NOT DO A GREAT JOB COLLECTING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. WE'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE WITH CODED. THE DATA THAT WE DO HAVE WHICH IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH BUT AT LEAST WE CAN SEE. SOME OF THE AGE DISPARITIES AND RACIAL. DISPARITIES AMONG COVE IT IMPACT NOT JUST ONE. PARTICULAR HEALTH PROBLEMS. AND SO WE'VE NEVER DONE THE GREATEST JOB AROUND- DEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION AND THEN OF COURSE. WITH SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY WE DO A CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS AN ABYSMAL JOB. BASICALLY COLLECTING EITHER NO DATA. OR EXCEPTIONALLY SPORADIC AND LIMITED DATA ON IMPACTS. WHETHER IT'S OF CODE OR ANYTHING ELSE ON THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. AND EVEN LAST YEAR WHEN WE PASS LEGISLATION MANDATING THE COLLECTION. IT REALLY HASN'T HAPPENED. IN A MEANINGFUL WAY BECAUSE OF. PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE DISJOINTED NATURE. OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO ALL IT TAKES IS ONE BOTTLE NEXT TO PREVENT THAT. FROM HAPPENING. SEMI I WOULD I WOULD I GUESS IS A BE A REQUEST. I THINK THIS BILL GIVEN ITS COOL WHICH IS A REALLY IMPORTANT GOAL OF TO. BOB THIS- IF BE AN AXE. A NEW ARE. TO PERHAPS CORPORATE. IN THE BILL. FOR DEVON. DATA COLLECTION INCLUDE. SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY. ON AND TO SAYS D. INTEGRATE THAT DATA COLLECTION AND ASSISTANCE I WANT TO REQUEST. ON THAT YOU AND YOUR SPONSORS CONSIDER THAT WE WILL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU WE HAVE A COALITION OF GROUPS. THAT FOCUS ON AND I THINK IT COULD BE A WIN WIN SO IF YOU COULD MAYBE JUST COMMENT ON- YES I DO I DO AGREE THAT- THIS IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO GET THE INFORMATION. AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY- NOT AFTER WE'VE GOT A PANDEMIC REACHING AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S GETTING SICK AND WHO ISN'T IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE. THIS INFORMATION THIS DATA- WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IN LOOKING AT- ILLNESSES AND DISEASES AND UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT BETTER THEIR THEIR ORIGIN SO HIGH. MORE I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE'LL CONNECT YOU WITH THE GROUPS THAT ARE WORKING ON THESE ISSUES OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OR QUESTIONS. K. IN THE NO. UP YOU. IF NOT THE- MAKES WILL TELL IS. ARE. FOR- PRESIDING OFFICER ME NOTED- SO SEE NINE OF US ARE KIND OF I THOUGHT DON'T THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS BILL TO I WILL JUST COMMENT THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT- THERE'S A FROM THE- THAT ALSO DRESSES SOMEBODY- PARALLEL ISSUES INCLUDING ACTUALLY THE REQUIREMENT HE SAID WHAT YOU MENTIONED THAT ALSO IS IT BECOMES A RESOURCE DISCUSSION TO. APPRECIATE THAT YOUR THAT THE ONGOING WORKS TO FURTHER REFINE THE BILL- I WOULD MAKE NOTE- SO SENATE LEADERS COURSE MENTIONED- BISMOL- PROFITABLE. THE DISMAL. OF TRYING TO THE OF COLLECTING DATA ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY AND OF COURSE FOR THE API COMMUNITY IT'S- THERE'S ALSO DISAGGREGATION OF THE DATA AND SUBGROUPS BECAUSE TOO OFTEN- THINGS GET MASS THAT WAY AS WELL SO. APPRECIATE YOU ALSO LOOKING INTO THOSE ISSUES AS WELL- BUT THAT CERTAINLY. WANT THANK YOU IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I THINK- ALL THE SENATORS THAT- HAVE QUESTIONS IN THAT HAVE SOME REALLY REALLY GOOD IDEAS.

ANOTHER ISSUE THE PANDEMIC I GUESS THAT WORLD DEALING WITH- GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY. AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE THE CHAIR IN THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR EVERYBODY'S WORK ON THIS AND- TO SAY I ACCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE. AMENDMENTS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB THREE EIGHTY WHICH WILL MAKE SOME REVISIONS TO THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. CURRENTLY I UP BY ORIGINALLY AUTHORED THE BILL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND IT WENT INTO EFFECT JUNE OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. SO THE INITIAL BUILD. WE'VE HELD OVERSIGHT HEARINGS IN THE ASSEMBLY ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT WITH INPUT FROM. CALIFORNIA PARTNER PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDERS HOSPITALS PATIENTS FAMILIES AND MORE- THERE ARE. REPORTS THAT COME OUT EVERY SINGLE YEAR ABOUT I. THROUGH THOSE THOSE HEARINGS AND ADDITIONAL DATA AND ANECDOTES WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO ACCESS FOR PATIENTS. OVER FIVE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION THE CURRENT PROCESS TO OBTAIN MEDICAL AID IN DYING. DRUGS IS UNNECESSARILY CUMBERSOME AND IS CREATED MANY ROADBLOCKS FOR MANY DYING PATIENTS. ONE STUDY FROM KAISER PERMANENTE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHOW THAT ONE THIRD. OF TERMINALLY ILL ADULTS TO REQUEST THE USE OF THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT DIED BEFORE COMPLETING THE TIME CONSUMING PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES A FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD. BETWEEN ORAL REQUESTS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN OREGON UPDATED THEIR LAW AND AUTHORIZED A WAIVER OF THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN OUR REQUEST TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. RECENT DATA SHOWS A PATIENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DIED DURING THE WAITING PERIOD. WERE ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR MEDICAL AID IN DYING THANKS TO THE AMENDMENTS. TO ADDRESS SIMILAR CONCERN JUST LAST WEEK NEW MEXICO CHANGE THEIR FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN TWO OR REQUEST TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS. WHY WOULD WE LIKE TO PREVENT ANY MORE TERMINALLY ILL TELL KATC TERMLY ILL CALIFORNIANS FROM SUFFERING UNNECESSARILY. IS ALSO BECOME CLEAR THAT THE SECOND WRITTEN REQUEST. DESCRIBED AS A FINAL ATTESTATION IS UNNECESSARY IT IS GIVEN TO THE PATIENT BY THEIR ATTENDING PHYSICIAN WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO FILL OUT. THE PRESCRIBED FORM WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF SELF ADMINISTERING THE AID IN DYING DRUGS. TERMLY ILL PATIENTS WHO ARE NEARING THEIR DEATHS HAVE ALREADY. HAD TWO EVALUATIONS PLACED INTO OR REQUEST THE FIRST WRITTEN REQUEST THAT WAS WITNESSED BY TWO INDIVIDUALS. THIS FOURTH REQUEST SEEMS REDUNDANT AND- AND PATIENTS REPORT. THE ADVANTAGE REPORT I CAN JUST ONE MORE THING THAT THEY HAVE TO TRY TO CHECK OFF THE BOX AT THE VERY END. CERTAINLY THE END OF THE LUCK LIFE OPTION ACT. REQUIRES THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN TO REMIND. QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS TO NOT SELF ADMINISTER AID IN DYING DRUGS IN A PUBLIC PLACE THIS IS BECAUSE SOME CONFUSION AMONG SOME HEALTHCARE FACILITIES THAT INTERPRET THAT LAW TO PROHIBIT PATIENTS FROM PARTICIPATING IN MEDICAL AID IN DYING IN THEIR FACILITY. ANOTHER BARRIER IS THE INCONSISTENCY IN WHICH OUR REQUEST FOR AID IN DYING DRUGS ARE DATED AND DOCUMENTED IN PATIENTS RECORDS. THIS BILL MAINTAINS THE COR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ONLY TERMINALLY ILL ADULTS WITH A TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS AND SIX MONTHS OR LESS TO LIVE FOR MENTALLY CAPABLE OF MAKING THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS AND ARE ABLE TO SELF IN JUST. EIGHT IN DYING MEDICATIONS QUALIFY UNDER THE LAW. ATIONS WILL STILL HAVE TO MAKE TWO ORAL REQUESTS AS A WRITTEN REQUEST. IN THE EVALUATED BY TWO SEPARATE POSITIONS IF EITHER PHYSICIAN FEELS THAT IS NECESSARY. THE PATIENT MAY ALSO BE EVALUATED BY A LICENSED PSYCHIATRIST OR PSYCHOLOGIST TO CERTIFY. THAT THE PATIENT IS MEDICALLY CAPABLE MENTALLY CAPABLE OF GIVING INFORMED CONSENT. THIS BILL REQUIRE THAT THE DATE OF THE ORAL AND WRITTEN REQUEST MUST BE DOCUMENTED ENSURING TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS. ACCESS TO TIMELY MEDICAL CARE UPON A TRANSFER OF CARE THAT MEDICAL RECORD WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL. WILL ALSO SHORTEN THE MANDATORY WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN OR REQUEST FROM FIFTEEN. DAYS TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS. THIS BILL WILL DEFINE PUBLIC PLACE AND CLARIFY THAT A HEALTH CARE FACILITY DOES NOT FALL UNDER THAT DEFINITION. IF THE PROVIDER IS UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO HONOR A PATIENT'S REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE POLICY. AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A STANDARD OF CARE BEING UPHELD BETWEEN THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THEM TO INFORM THE PATIENT THAT THEY DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE ACT. DOCUMENT THE PATIENT'S DATE OF REQUEST. AND PROVIDER NOTICE TO THE PATIENT OF THEIR OBJECTION IN THE MEDICAL RECORD. TRANSFER THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORD IMMEDIATELY UPON REQUEST. THIS BILL THIS BILL WILL ALSO REPEAL THE SUNSET DATE. DATE WE KNOW FROM DATA COLLECTED FROM THE CALIFORNIADEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN NEARLY TWO THOUSAND TERMINALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS HAVE RECEIVED A PRESCRIPTION FOR AID IN DYING DRUGS. THAT'S TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL STORE GRANTED THE OPPORTUNITY BE IN CHARGE. OF THEIR END OF LIFE CARE. THE PROTECTIONS BUILT INTO THE LAW HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTED INSTANCES OF ABUSE- CORE OR CORROSION. AND IT'S TIME TO MAKE THIS LAW PERMANENT ENSURE THAT ALL ELIGIBLE TERMINALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. AND DIE WITH DIGNITY. THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN AND JUST- I WASN'T SURE IF I MISSED IT- AND SO THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE CONSISTENT WITH IT BUT YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS. THAT IS CORRECT.

TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME OF THE POWER BACK THAT THEY- VERY FREQUENTLY LOSE DURING THEIR TIME PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY MANY PATIENTS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR OBSTACLES WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO ACCESS AID IN DYING. I WANT TO SECOND BUT SENATOR EGGMAN VERY WONDERFULLY PUT- THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE IS THE MANDATORY MINIMUM. FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN THE TWO ORAL REQUESTS. FOR AID IN DYING MEDICATION REQUIRED UNDER THE CURRENT LAW. A LOT OF MEDICATIONS I YOU MAKE THEIR REQUEST. WOULD SUFFICIENT LEAD TIME BUT CAN IN THE BEGINNING BOB DOWN IN THE RIVER FOR OR THAT THERE IS AN TO FORM REFERRAL. THAT THEY'RE IN.

WHEN THE SMALLEST PACKAGE SUPPORTERS APPOINTED TO THESE PROVISIONS AND SAFEGUARDS. TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ARE PROTECTED. NOW PROPONENTS WANT TO STRIP THEM AWAY- I'M REALLY IS OF THE PERIOD A LANCER STUDY FOUND. THAT PATIENTS WILL TO LIVE COSTRUCTION WAIT 30% IN A TWELVE HOUR PERIOD AND THE LONGER IT WENT THE HIGHER THE PERCENTAGE OF FLUCTUATION SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW A BAD DAY OR TWO THAT DAY SHOULD NOT MEAN A DEATH SENTENCE A FEW HOURS LATER- I ALSO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE SUNSET CLAUSE. ACTIVE CAL LET. WOULD LOOK AT EXTENSION DATA EXTENSION DATA BEFORE MAKING A RASH DECISION TO ELIMINATE THE SUNSET CLAUSE BUT LET'S LOOK AT THE SORRY STATE OF CALIFORNIANS DATA REPORTING. THERE IS NO DATA ABOUT WHAT PATIENTS ILLNESSES EVEN WORK UNLIKE IN OTHER STATES WHERE IT IS LEGAL. THERE'S NO STATISTICS ABOUT REFERRALS FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS UNLIKE IN OTHER STATES THERE ARE NO REASONS FOR PATIENTS AFTER CLASS UNLIKE IN OTHER STATES. THERE'S NO DATA ABOUT WHEN THE PATIENT INGESTED LEGAL DRUGS OR WHETHER THEY HAD COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS REGURGITATION OR SEIZURES OR WAKING UP INSTEAD OF DYING. ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED- AND- IT WOULD HAVE COME TO LIGHT IN OTHER STATES. NO ONE'S REQUIRED TO BE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF INGESTION SO THERE'S NO WAY TO REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND MOST EGREGIOUS CALIFORNIA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED DESTRUCTION OF THE LAND UNDERLYING DATA EVERY THREE YEARS. WHAT THE OVERSIGHT HEARING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHO DEAL WITH THE DATA THE STATE DOES COLLECTIONS LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. BUT THEY HAVE NO ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I CAN REMOVE THE SUNSET CLAUSE WHILE IGNORING MANY CRUCIAL THING THANK. THANK YOU. NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR SITE WITNESS- DOCTOR TELLS. YEAH THIS IS DOCTOR BY CALL ON MCCALLUM NAY AND CALIFORNIA SISTERS WHO ALSO SEE AS THE GOVERNOR THE BOTTOM FOR THE MAYOR COLLEGE TO SAY HOW TO BRING WHAT I CONSIDER THE PER THANK YOU COM OF THIS BILL THIS BILL STATES IN A POSITION LIKE MYSELF DOES NOT CONSIDER ASSISTED SUICIDE OF MEDICAL TREATMENT AND I DON'T INFORM THE PATIENT AS SUCH BUT I HAVE NOT PROVIDED INFORMED CONSENT WHICH INFERS LIABILITY IN NEGLIGENCE WHAT IS FIRST REMEMBER THAT ASSISTED SUICIDE IS NOT UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED AS A STANDARD OF MEDICAL CARE FOR TERMINAL ILLNESS. IT'S SUPPOSED IS UNETHICAL BY THE TWO LARGEST PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS STATE MERITED MEDICAL SAYS YOU SHOULDN'T AND THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS THIS BILL ALSO STATES THAT PHYSICIANS MUST REFER THE PATIENT FOR SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S WILLING TO GIVE THEM THE LEGAL MEDICATIONS EVEN IF THE REFERRING PHYSICIAN CONSIDERS THIS PRACTICE NOT ONLY UNETHICAL BUT NOT THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR PARTICULAR ILLNESS AND WHAT OF SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF DOESN'T THINK THE PATIENT IS TERMINAL WITHIN A FIFTEEN DAY FOR SIX MONTHS FOR A FORTY EIGHT HOUR WINDOW. IF I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT OR NOT AND A GUY DOWN THE ROAD BELIEVES THEY ARE THAT OPENS ME UP TO LIABILITY CENSURE AND SANCTIONS SO THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS WHY ARE WE TRYING TO BUILD BERKELEY OVERDOSE PATIENTS WHEN WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME THEY HAVE WELL. SPELL DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS FEDERAL LAW I BELIEVE THAT SECTION FIFTEEN FIFTY THREE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION. DISSIPATION AND ASSIST SILVA. AND FINALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THESE OX YOU'RE ASKING LIKE ME TO. MENTAL TO IT. NOT EVEN THE SIZE OR LICENSE LIKE SOMEONE THAT HAS FULLER TRY THAN MY- SO ASK WINDOWS A PRESCRIPTION PICK YEARS. TAKE THE TO DIE. AND MAKE IT TO DIE FOR THE LICENSE REVOKED UNITY IS ALREADY OUT TROUBLE ACTS TO CARE THANK YOU SO MUCH FROM TO.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE OTHER QUESTION IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHURCH YES PLEASE THANK YOU. OKAY WALK ME THROUGH THIS- YOU HAVE A PATIENT WHO HAS- CANCER YOUR THE PHYSICIAN LET'S SAY IT'S BEING OKAY YOU'RE THE DOCTOR AND THE PATIENT CAN YOU TELL ME DO YOU HAVE CANCER WHICH I'M ASSUMING WE WOULD KNOW BEFORE FIFTEEN DAYS BEFORE MY DEATH BED AND THAT I'VE BEEN RECEIVING TREATMENT BUT YOU SAY I THINK YOU'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN DAYS. AND THEN I SAY OKAY WHY WOULD LIKE TO EXERCISE MY END OF LIFE OPTIONS YOU SAY FINE- BUT YOU HAVE TO WAIT TWO DAYS. IS THAT RIGHT. PHONE. DO YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS ON THAT BECAUSE I DO SO THAT WHEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS AND I KEEP GOING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE MEMBERS WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I'M VERY TORN ON THIS ISSUE BUT I DO WANT AT LEAST NOW YOU KNOW MAKE AN EDUCATED VOTE HERE AS TO HOW THE TIME WHEN YOU CHANGE THE NOTE WENT IN TWO WEEKS IT'S DOWN FORTY EIGHT DAYS- HOURS. I'M SORRY HOURS GOSH NINE DAYS- SO THAT THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING IS IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME LIKE A BASIC HERE'S ON THIS WOULD ROLL OUT CERTAINLY CERTAINLY AND I AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- SO I THINK THAT THE ONE THING THAT WE NEED TO SAY IS THAT SOMEONE IS NOT GIVEN A DIAGNOSIS AND REQUESTING A MEDICATION I DON'T THINK EVER HAPPENS LIKE THAT RIGHT SOMEBODY HAS BEEN GIVEN A DIAGNOSIS THEY HAVE GENERALLY YOU KNOW SOME THE OPPOSITION I GREW. IT CAN IS ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A TO. ILLNESS THEY ARE GOING TO DIE. THE OFTENTIMES IN IN FOR ALL THE DATA WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE ENGAGE ACTIVELY IN TREATMENT AND IN TRIALS AND THEN CHEMO AND DO EVERYTHING. TILL THEY DECIDED THAT'S- THE CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT. WORTH T ANYMORE AND WE'RE TO END IN THE END IS VERY NEAR IT IT IS NOT IT THE END OF THE MIRACLE HAS NOT HAPPENED THE TREATMENT HAS NOT TURNED THINGS AROUND. AT THAT POINT SOMEBODY OFTENTIMES THAT TOWARDS THE END THEY HAVE NOW. DETERIORATED TO A POINT WHERE IF THEY WERE TO ASK THE PHYSICIAN. I'D LIKE TO EXERCISE THIS- THE PHYSICIAN AT THAT POINT AND I THINK WHAT WE HEARD SOME SOMETIMES IF YOU HAVEN'T ASKED YOU DON'T KNOW RIGHT SO THAT POSITIONAL SAY OKAY YOU'LL HAVE FIFTY DAYS I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT AND YOU SAY CAN I GET A REFER. A I'M SORRY I'M A DOCUMENT WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE SAYING YOU HAVE TO DOCUMENT THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT AND THEN- SO THEN THAT THAT PATIENT HAS TO GO. WITH HOPE YOU KNOW MAYBE A VERY SHORT TIME TO TRY TO FIND ANOTHER POSITION TO DO THAT INITIAL AND THEN WAIT FIFTEEN DAYS AFTER THAT TIME. TO ASK THE SECOND POSITION IT IS IT IS THAT IT IS IT IS THAT PERIOD SOMETIMES AND LIKE WE HEARD ONE OF THE YOUNG WOMEN SUPPORTERS CALLED IN AND SAID. IT THEY HAD THOUGHT PHYSICIAN WAS GOING SAY OKAY-AND THEY- WHEN THEY WERE TOLD NO THAT THAT STARTED THE CLOCK BUT THAT DIDN'T START THE CLOCK BECAUSE- THEY WERE NOT EVALUATED. TO THAT DEGREE. SO THAT'S THE ISSUE AND WE'RE NOT ANTICIPATING THAT PEOPLE WILL. ACTIVATE THAT FORTY EIGHT HOURS IT IS MORE OF A SAFEGUARD. FROM THE ALL THE PEOPLE WE HEARD THAT SAID IT WASN'T TOO LATE AND THEN HE OR SHE DIED IN EXACTLY THE WAY THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DIE. AFTER HAVING TOLD EVERYBODY THIS IS YOU KNOW NOT WHAT I WANT. AND ENDING UP SO THAT. THAT IS WHAT'S BEEN FOUND CONSISTENTLY IN OTHER STATES AND THAT'S WHY- WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT SAME THING. IF IT IF IT LEAVES COMMITTEE. OKAY THAT DOES HELP ME THANK YOU IN UNDERSTANDING THE TIMELINE- I KNOW. I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU- YOU KNOW I LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES OF THIS AND I WAS HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR FIRST BILL CAME DURING STRUGGLED. MIGHTILY WITH THAT FRANKLY AS A AS A CATHOLIC- BUT IS ALSO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO. YOU KNOW STEP INTO MY LIFE TO THE TO THE EXTREMES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO THIS IS. THIS IS A TOUGH ONE BY- THE TIME LINE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AT SOME OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN WORDS VERY FRUSTRATING OF A VERY MADE THE DECISION AND THEN YET THEY CAN'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT DECISION I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. THOUGH I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF SOME OTHERS WHERE- THAT IS A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. DURING WHICH- YEAH I HAVE SOME BAD DAYS I REMEMBER GOING THROUGH THIS WITH MY OWN FATHER LIVES SOME DAYS ARE GREAT SOME DAYS ARE NOT SO GREAT AND- HIS MOOD CHANGED WITH THAT. SO THAT IS OF CONCERN BUT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOU- BRING A BILL FORWARD AND NINE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO. HELP EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT IT IS YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THANK YOU. THANK UP OKAY TO THAT. NUMBER SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ALSO THAT THAT THAT PEOPLE DIED BUT THEN THIS LIKE SOMEBODY WITH A LESS THAN CAN NO LONGER LIFT IT UP TO BE ABLE TO SELF ADMINISTER BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE CRITERIA AS WELL YOU MUST BE ABLE TO. SELF ADMINISTER. AND THE AGONY OF WARNING IT AND IT BEING THERE AND THEN. JUST WATCHING IT. AND I WILL SAY THE DATA ALSO. CLEARLY SHOWS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GET THE PRESCRIPTION DON'T TAKE IT BUT IT'S JUST THE COMFORT. THAT THEY'RE- THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO RELAX THEN AND YOU KNOW AND DIED A NATURAL DEATH ON THEIR OWN TERMS STILL. BUT KNOWING THAT THAT THAT IS THERE IN CASE THEY NEED. THANK YOU A CERTAIN AMOUNT. THANK YOU AS THE STATE AND SENATOR I WAS NOT IN THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT CERTAINLY I HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS BILL AND THEN YOU KNOW IT CAUSED A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS IN THE DISTRICT- ONE QUESTION FOR YOU IN THAT ECONOMY AND THE MY QUESTION IS THE OPPOSITION SPOKE ABOUT DATA HOWEVER AND THE LACK THERE OF THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED HOWEVER YOU REFERENCE DATA COLLECTED IN BOTH YOUR OPENING STATEMENT AND IN THIS LAST-RESPONSE TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE. HE KNEW THAT IT KIND OF JUST COMMENTED OR HELP US UNDERSTAND- WHETHER OR NOT WE COLLECT DATA WHAT DATA IS APPROPRIATE AND HOW THAT DATA IS INFORMING- THE DIRECTION YOU ARE TAKING- IN THIS NEXT KIND OF PHASE OF THIS BILL MMHM THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YEAH SO WE LOOK AT THE DATA FROM OTHER STATES AS WELL SO THE STATE OF OREGON HAS HAD. THE ACT IN PLACE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS NOW SO WE LOOK AT THE DATA AS WELL AS OUR OWN AND THE DATA THAT IS COLLECTED IS THE DATA THAT WAS LAID OUT IN THE VERY FIRST BILL THAT WE DID THAT WAS NEGOTIATED TO THE COLLECTED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT CUT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR ANYBODY TO SEE IT ANYTIME IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THE STATE'S WEBSITE- AND IT'S MOSTLY DEMOGRAPHICS IT'S SAID THAT IT'S DIAGNOSES- COVER EVERYTHING UP AT THE TOP OF MY HEAD- BUT BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS NOT SOMEBODY WHO HAS TO SIT THERE AND WATCH SOMEBODY GO THAT IS NOT THAT IT. WASN'T NOT PART OF THE BILL INITIALLY IT'S NOT SOME IT'S BEEN FOR LIKE IT'S INTRUSIVE A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW DO INVITE FAMILY AND FRIENDS AROUND TO BE THERE WITH THEM IN THEIR FINAL MOMENTS BUTTON NOT EVERYBODY DOES SO- THE DATA IS WHAT WHAT WAS LAID OUT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BILL AND IT IS COLLECTED EVERY YEAR SO THE IDEA OF- REMOVING THE SUNSET JUST WILL LET'S JUST BE WIDE OPEN THERE IS STILL DATA THAT IS COLLECTED IT IS REPORTED EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND WE HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AND CAN MAKE. ADJUSTMENTS LATER. IF NEED. EIGHT YOU AND M. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- MY GRANDMOTHER PASSED AWAY AS- THE- I CAN'T. AND IT FOR THOSE THAT HAD. HAD LIVED THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO IS. VERY FEW. ESPECIALLY AT THE END AND SO THAT. YOU KNOW I THINK BACK TO WHAT IT WOULD HAVE. TO HAVE THIS OPTION- MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN EXPLORED BUT- CERTAINLY I THINK THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL DESERVES HE TO THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT FOR THEMSELVES- AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT IN THIS I KNOW THAT MY DISTRICT HAS HAD A LOT OF FEEDBACK ON ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- AND- YOU KNOW IT IS NOT AN EASY ISSUE FOR A LOT OF FOLKS BUT I THINK NONETHELESS. IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS I TO ME SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M SORRY FOR THE LOSS YOU GRANDMA. RIGHT A CENTER WIENER. BUT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- AFTER SOLIDIFYING- CENTER ADMIN FOR HER LONG TERM TENACIOUS WORK ON THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I REQUEST TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL. AND I THINK I'M MAKING THIS PERMANENT MAKE SENSE IS A BASIC ISSUE OF. COMPASSION AND MERCY- AND- YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH THAT I WISH WE'D DONE A LONG. TIME AGO THIS IS NOTHING SOMETIMES YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ABOUT- YOU KNOW IT ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BE PORTIONS OF THIS BY. I DON'T THINK THAT THE RECORD ACTUALLY SUPPORTS- I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. EVERYONE FAMILY INDIVIDUALS MEDICAL FOR EVERYONE TEXAS. CREDIBLY SERIOUSLY. PEOPLE UNDER THAT THIS IS A LIFE OR DEATH. DECISION BUT PEOPLE IN ALSO UNDERSTANDS. THAT FORCING SOMEONE TO GO THROUGH THE END STAGES OF AN UNBELIEVABLY PAINFUL- TERMINAL MEDICAL CONDITION JUST IF IT'S NOT HUMANA PEOPLE SET UP OPTIONS AND THAT IS THE COMPASSIONATE AND MERCIFUL THING TO DO. SO I RESPECT A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THIS IS A GOOD FAITH POLICY DEBATE BUT I FALL FIRMLY ON THE SIDE OF. A ALLOWING THIS COMPASSION TO OCCUR AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU THE AUTHOR FOR HER WORK. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. YES SIR LEYVA SORRY. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR I REALLY JUST WANT TO THANK SENATOR EGGMAN FOR HER WORK IN THE ASSEMBLY ON THIS AND NOW CONTINUING IN THE SENATE I HAD JUST BEEN ELECTED WHEN THIS BILL CAME UP AND I REMEMBER THINKING WHILE. WE ARE WORKING ON SOME REALLY TOUGH STUFF HERE AND IT'S SUCH AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE BUT IT'S SUCH AN APARTMENT PORTANT ISSUE AND I THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO TAKE IT ON AND TO BRING US ALL ALONG AS WELL MY MOM WENT ALL THROUGH PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS AND SERVER I CALLED HER AND I SAID MOM. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS AND YOU KNOW LIKE BATTLE OF MY MOM SHE IS VERY TO THE POINT AND BLUNT AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW HONEY WE DON'T MAKE AN ANIMAL SUFFER WHY WOULD WE MAKE PEOPLE SUFFER AND I SAID WELL THAT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT I JUST THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO WORK ON IT AND BRING US ALL ALONG WITH YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY.

BENEFITTED IF THAT'S EVEN YOU KNOW AWAY IT TO FRAME IT. FROM THIS- FROM THIS SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THEY WOULD HAVE DIED WITH DIGNITY AND THAT'S A THINK- THE PROMISE OF THIS- I HAVE RECEIVED OVER THIRTY- EMAILS FROM RESIDENTS IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL FROM THE LONG BEACH FOR A PANTHERS WHO ARE. CIVICALLY ACTIVE AND ENGAGED I'M JUST LOOKING AT THEIR TWITTER CIVICALLY ACTIVE ENGAGING SO.

OKAY SEEING NONE- SACRAMENTO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF. TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS- YOU KNOW- WHEN NAY YOU BROUGHT THE ORIGINAL BILL I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A SKEPTIC AND THAT MEANT I DID NOT VOTE FOR THE BILL I. CONCERNS BUT SAME TIME IT IS LAW- THE ORIGINAL BILL. AND THEY THINK THAT- IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS SOMETHING PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ONCE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WORKS. AND THAT'S WHY- I'VE KNOWN THAT IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH ME TO. JUST SOME OF THE PARAMETERS- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS RAISED IN TERMS OF- LIKE TIMING AND SO FORTH BUT I ALSO POINT OUT BECAUSE I KNOW SOMEONE HAD DONE. THAT IT'S BEEN ASKED. BUT THERE IS THERE IS A WHOLE PROCESS ARE A LOT OF PROTECTIONS I MEAN THOSE ARE PROTECTIONS ORIGINAL BILL I DON'T THINK WE'RE WEAKENING THOSE PROTECTIONS AT ALL. WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING AT THIS BILL WHAT WE'RE MAKING IS MAKING MORE WORKABLE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY. DESIRE AND ONCE- THIS OPTION. SO DAD. AGAIN I THINK SO MUCH WORK OF THE STAFF ABSENT CERTAINLY PERSONAL HELP IN SUPPORT OF. THIS BILL WOULD TO LIKE CLOSE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR MUCH AND THINK THINGS TO A MY CALL FOR. OTHER THOUGHTFUL. AND I KNOW IS A VERY DIFFICULT IS DEATH IS DEATH IS THE- AT THE BUT IS ONE THE THING THAT WILL FACE. THAT WE WILL ALL FACE AND- IT JUST SEEMS RIGHT THAT WESHOULD BE ABLE TO FACE IT ON OUR OWN TERMS. AND I'M ALSO A PRACTICING CATHOLIC. GO TO MASS EVERY EVERY WEEKEND WHEN THIS CAME UP THE- THE CHURCH REACH OUT AND WANTED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ON THEIR FORGET MY SCHEDULE SAID THE BISHOP ONCE. FORTY FIVE AN HOUR AND A HALF AND I SAID. GIVE THE BISHOP AN HOUR AND A HALF. THE BISHOP CARE MENU HAD FIVE OTHER FOLKS WITH THEM AND WE DIALOGUE AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME. AND YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE- SO. THIS IS THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT SOMEBODY IS HAVING A BAD DAY THIS BILL IS ABOUT SOMEBODY WITH A TERMINAL ILLNESS FACING THE END OF THEIR LIFE. HAVING LIVED THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AND AT THE VERY END BEING ABLE TO DECIDE. THEIR TERMS- SO WITHOUT AND WITH ALL OF THE SAFEGUARDS- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN IS THERE A MOTION ON THE BILL. OKAY IT'S MOVE THE BILLS MOVE BY CENTER LEYVA THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST. AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMEDIAN JUDICIARY'S ANOTHER POLICY COMMITTEE- CONTROLLED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HAND HI CAN. HI MELINDA'S. EIGHT HI EGGMAN ITEMS. HI AND SALAS I GREW. GROVE NO RETIRE.

SEVEN ONE OKAY THE BILL'S CURRENTLY SEVEN ONE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR AT ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL BEFORE US HERE- SO ITEM NUMBER FOR SB FIVE OH SEVEN- PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN STILL HERE I AM NOT PRESENT SB FIVE OH SEVEN A BILL THAT WILL MAKE REVISIONS. TO ON LPS LAST YEAR. I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT AND RECOMMENDED THE ANALYSIS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE SUBJECT OF A HEARING MAINTAIN THE RIGHT TO APPEAR. IN COURT IN PERSON IF THEY SHOULD CHOOSE. THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS. EXITING INVOLUNTARY HOLDS BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ROLLED CONSEQUENTLY IN SUBSEQUENT CARE TO HELP THEM TRANSITION SAFELY INTO THEIR COMMUNITY AND KEEP THEM CONNECTED TO VITAL RESOURCES. ROUGHLY ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE PLACED ON CONSERVATORSHIP CYCLE BACK TO RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS. DESPITE HAVING SUCCESSFULLY RECOVERED. YOUR ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEIR BASIC NEEDS WHEN THEY EXITED CONSERVATORSHIP. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW TO QUALIFY FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT A PERSON'S. CONDITION MUST BE SUBSTANTIALLY DETERIORATING. THIS CRITERION. SINCE WE PROHIBITS THOSE EXITING MORE RESTRICTIVE TREATMENT SETTINGS FROM ACCESSING AOTI EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BENEFIT FROM THE SERVICES. THIS BILL REVISES ELIGIBILITY ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT IT APPEARS REASONABLY LIKELY THAT THEY WILL BE AT SIGNIFICANT RISK FOR DETERMINATION BASED ON THEIR TREATMENT HISTORY AND CURRENT BEHAVIOR. WE WANT COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO OFFER PROVIDE A. O. T. PROGRAMS THAT WOULD PROVIDE CONTINUED TREATMENT AND ACCESS TO RESOURCES TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE EXAM OR TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHERE THE DEFENDANT HAS CAPACITY TO GIVE INFORMED CONSENT. REGARDING PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS WE KNOW THAT IT HURTS TO TAKING MEDICATION IS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT. TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S RECOVERY. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS A. O. T. PLANTS FROM INCLUDING. INVOLUNTARY MEDICATION. ALLOWING THE EXAMINER TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT OF MEDICATION DURING THE HEARING IS A SMALL STEP TOWARD INITIATING A DIALOGUE ABOUT THE PATIENT'S CAPACITY. TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY NEED MEDICATION. ESTABLISHING THIS CONVERSATION DURING THE HEARING WILL ALSO ENSURE. THAT IT IS DOCUMENTED IN THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL FILE WHICH CAN THEN BE REFERENCED DURING FUTURE MEDICATION COMPLIANCE CON CONVERSATIONS. WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. FINALLY THE BILL INCORPORATES A RECOMMEND RECOMMENDATION FROM THE AUDITOR TO ALLOW APPEARANCE. BEFORE THE COURT FOR TESTIMONY BY EXAMINING MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER BY VIDEO CONFERENCING. DO NOT CALL OUT ANY ON IT THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE SUBJECT OF THE PETITION TO ALSO APPEAR. VIA VIDEO IF THEY CHOOSE AND THEY RIPPED RETAIN THE RIGHT TO BE PRESENT AT THE HEARING. THE SPEND IMMIGRATION IS ALL THAT HAVING THE ABILITY TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO COMMUNICATE IS CRUCIAL WE WANT THIS ACCESS TO CONTINUE LONG AFTER THIS PANDEMIC IS ENDED. OUR CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES IN BOTH HOUSES ARE WORKING TIRELESSLY ON POLICIES TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM. I TALK ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WE ARE EXPERIENCING LAST YEAR WERE PRESENTING AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WE ARE STILL IN A CRISIS IN THE PANDEMIC IS STILL GOING ON. WE NEED SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND RESOURCES. A. O. T. WORKS IT INCREASES THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE ONE'S QUALITY OF LIFE. IT INCREASES THE CHANCES FOR RECOVERY. FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. IT SAVES LIVES AND IT KEEPS PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY IN A LESS RESTRICTIVE.

OF TWENTY TWENTY. HI ON THE AUDIT AND THEIR- IT- CLARIFIES THAT THOSE WHO WERE- WERE EXITING WHO RECENTLY EXITED. CONSERVATOR SHIPS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO BE PLACED IN THIS INVOLUNTARY ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. CURRENTLY COURTS CAN ORDER CONSERVATOR SHIPS ONLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR BASIC NEEDS. HOWEVER AFTER RECEIVING TREATMENT AND EXITING CONSERVATORSHIP. INDIVIDUALS ARE OFTEN NOT. CONNECTED TO CONTINUE CARE AS YOU HEARD IS THAT IT DURING THE DISCUSSION OF SB FIVE OF SEVEN. AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS DAY RELAPSE AND NEED CONSERVATIVE SHIPS AGAIN. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT ONE IN FOUR INDIVIDUALS WHO OF THE ACCIDENT CONSERVATORSHIP SWEAR PLACED. BACK IN CONSERVATORSHIP AGAINDESPITE HAVING BEEN DEEMED TO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RECOVERED- PREVIOUSLY. ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IS USED BY COUNTIES PROVIDE CARE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING. ENSURES THAT INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE SERVICES SUCH AS PSYCHIATRIC SUBSTANCE ABUSE AT THE- AND ASSISTANCE WITH HOUSING. THE STATE AUDITOR RECOMMENDED THAT ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT BE USED WHEN APPROPRIATE FOR INDIVIDUALS EXITING CONSERVATIVE SHIPS. BUT AS THE AUTHORS NOTED THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE UNDER CURRENT LAW. AS AS YOU HAVE HEARD THE CRITERIA FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT SERVICES EXCLUDES THESE INDIVIDUALS- TO RESOLVE THIS CONTRADICTION THIS BILL ADOPTS THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR BY ALLOWING THE COURT TO ORDER AN INDIVIDUAL EXITING CONSERVATIVE SHIPS TO OBTAIN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. IF THE COURTS FIND THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT TREATMENT- THIS BILL ALLOWS THE COUNTIES TO USE THE- ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT AS A STEP DOWN FORM OF CARE AS INDIVIDUALS TRANSITION TO LIVING INDEPENDENTLY.

FOUR FIFTY FIVE WOULD PROVIDE. COVER CALIFORNIA THE FLEXIBILITY NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH ONGOING CHANGES. TO FEDERAL AND STATE POLICIES. THE RECENT TRANSITION TO A NEW ADMINISTRATION. ONGOING PROPOSALS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC. AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WOULD REQUIRE COVERED CALIFORNIA TO CREATE AND IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENT. REGULATIONS QUICKER THAN THROUGH THE PERMANENT RULEMAKING PROCESS. EVOLVING STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES COULD IMPACT ELIGIBILITY. ENROLLMENT AND OTHER AREAS OF COVERED CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS. THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE EMERGENCY RULE MAKING AUTHORITY. TO BE EXTENDED BEYOND JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WITHOUT THIS EMERGENCY RULEMAKING COVER CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS COULD CONFLICT WITH STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES AND ULTIMATELY TO LACK OF ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR FAMILIES.

THE A WILL CAN DO IT FOR THE SEASON- A- CAN DO IT WHO'S THE OIL OF THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN AND I WILL IS LIVE ANALYSTS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST GOT IT I'M THRILLED HISTORY OF LAW I BELIEVE NO OFFICE OF ISRAEL YES SORRY OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CLARIFICATIONS I WISH I WOULD HAVE. BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE HAD IT ON THE PAGE BEFORE I LEFT FOR THE OTHER COMMITTEE HEY OKAY I THINK THAT THERE IS A LIMITATION I DIDN'T NOT KNOW THERE WAS A RULE OR MAYBE AN UNWRITTEN RULE THAT YOU CAN ONLY DO IT ONCE OR TWICE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE EXTENDING THE RULE MAKING PROCESS AGAIN WE EXTENDED IT IN TWO THOUSAND. EIGHTEEN AND NOW AND SERVE JUST EXTENDING IT FOR THREE YEARS WE'RE GOING TO EXTEND IT FOR FIVE YEARS JUST TO GIVE THEM THE FLEXIBILITY THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THE MOST. COVER CALIFORNIANS CAN BE COVERED. AND I GET MY GUESS MAKE. IS A I APPRECIATE THAT LIKE I SAY I DO SUPPORT IT I JUST HAD CONCERNS BASICALLY WITH WITH THAT AND ALSO UNDER THE EMERGENCY ORDERS. I MEAN IT'S- TRANSIT TRANSPARENCY THAT I'M SEEKING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THINGS LIKE THAT UNDER. A REGULAR. A REGULATIONS WHEN THEY GET PAST THERE'S A FORTY FIVE DAY PUBLIC COMMENT. PERIOD AND UNDER EMERGENCY. REGULATIONS THAT ARE PASTORS ONLY A FIVE DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD SO- I GUESS I HAD. CONCERNS ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUE AND I ALSO HAD CONCERNS ABOUT- JUST ELIMINATING THE CAP COMPLETELY SO- BUT I SUPPORT THE IDEA OF MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING GETS DONE IN A PROCESS. AND WE HAVE TO CONFORM WITH FEDERAL. POLICY THAT CONSTANTLY CHANGES. AND YOU KNOW WE ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN THE STATE SO. I DO I JUST HAVE THOSE CONCERNS AND- THIS EXTENDS IT FOR FIVE YEARS IT DOESN'T COMPLETELY ELIMINATE WHAT CAP. WELL AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS BASED ON THE ANALYSIS THAT I HAVE AND THE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU CAN AND RENEW THEIR MERCY REGULATIONS. TWICE OKAY A BIT THIS ALLOWS THEM TO THAT WERE MOVING THAT CAP YEAH THE ACCORDING TO OFFICE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW THAT THERE WERE ELIMINATING THAT CAP TO BE ABLE TO DO IT MORE THAN TWICE GOTCHA I SEE OKAY YES WE ARE THAT IS CORRECT. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU MORE OFFLINE IF THAT IS HELPFUL US SENATOR GROUP BUT I CAN ALSO GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT THEY HAVE DONE UNDER THE EMERGENCY OF RULEMAKING IF THAT'S HELPFUL IN THE TRANSPARENCY PIECE BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE NUMBER OF DAYS- IN REGULAR RULEMAKING VERSUS THE EMERGENCY RULE MAKING IS THAT CORRECT. YES BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW PUBLIC COMMENT IT TAKES AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AND PEOPLE AROUND SACRAMENTO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS BUT IT TAKES AWHILE TO GET BACK TO OUR DISTRICTS WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE COMMENT ON CERTAIN THINGS. AND I THINK HEALTHCARE IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT OVER AND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND ALL OUR CONSTITUENTS TO HAVE COMMENT ON IT BURNUP THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MA'AM. RIGHT AND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. RIGHT ACTUALLY. THE CERTAINLY THE I WOULD MAKE NO THAT ACTUALLY A PRIOR BILL THAT YOU AUTHORED WHICH I BELIEVE FOR EXTENDING THE DEADLINE FOR ACTUALLY SAYS THAT WHILE WE AND THAT PRIOR BILL ACTUALLY REMOVED. THE T. A CAP ON THE TWO BUT- IN EXCHANGE REQUIRES THAT ANY CHANGES BE ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED AT A BOARD MEETING WHICH IT HAS TO BE PUBLIC. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A BOARD COVER CALIFORNIA BOARD. REGULATIONS BE PRESENTED AND THEN IT HAS TO BE AT THE SUBSEQUENT BOARD MEETING. A BEFORE CAN BE ADOPTED SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF INTENDED EMERGENCY REGULATION BY THE COVER CALIFORNIA BOARD- SO THAT JUST AN OBSERVATION I WOULD MAKE- AND- IN TERMS OF BEING SURE THAT WE HAVE- PEOPLE CAN. ACTUALLY COME IN THE GAUGE ON IT- BEFORE ADOPTION. THANK YOU SENATOR PAM I APPRECIATE YOU REMEMBERING MY OF HER LEGISLATION BETTER THAN I DO THINK HE'LL- WELL. I JUST WANTED BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN RAISED US SO- BUT CERTAINLY THANK YOU SAID I THINK THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT TO BE SURE WE DON'T HAVE. PATIENCE PLANS PROVIDERS OTHER PEOPLE BEING CAUGHT UP. IN A IN A JAM BETWEEN FEDERAL REGULATIONS WHICH MAY HAVE TO CHANGE OUR LAWS. AND THE STATE SO THAT WE ACHIEVE THE ATTENDS AND SO WITH THAT I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THIS BILL WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AN EARLY.
