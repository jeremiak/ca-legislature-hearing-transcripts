ASSEMBLY BILL THREE OF SIX WITH AMENDMENTS BY SOMETHING MEMBER HARPER. MISTER HARPER ON YOUR AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. THE AUTHOR STATES ASSIST BILLS BASED ON I WILL LONG. AND TO IMPOSE A DEADLINE ON WHEN VOTERS ARE TO COLLECT THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS. FROM VOTERS WHO TURNED THEM IN WITH ELECTION OFFICIALS. THAT'S OUTLINED HERE IN THE US. VOTER OR THE. INFORMATION SHE ON THE BILL PROVIDED BY THE AUTHOR HERSELF. BUT TAKING ONLY ONE PORTION OF THAT LAW IS MISLEADING. THESE AMENDMENTS WHATEVER UP THE REST OF THE IOWA LAW THAT WAS LEFT OUT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. THEY WOULD REQUIRE PEOPLE TO COLLECT VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS FROM VOTERS. TO PROVIDE A RECEIPT TO THE VOTER UPON REQUEST IDENTIFYING WHO IS PICKING UP THE BALLOT. THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD PROUD PROVISIONS TO PROTECT VOTERS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR VOTE IS COUNTED. AND NOT ONE VOTE IS DISENFRANCHISED. BY FAILING TO DELIVER THEIR BALLOT TO ELECTION OFFICIALS. WITHOUT THESE AMENDMENTS LAW ENFORCED MEANT OFFICIALS WILL HAVE NO WAY OF BEING ABLE TO TRACK DOWN WHO FAILED TO DELIVER VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS. IN THE FIRST ELECTION SINCE BALLOT HARVESTING WAS LEGALIZED THERE WERE PUBLISHED REPORTS OF OVERLY AGGRESSIVE HARASSING VOTE BY MAIL DESIGNEES. COERCING VOTERS INTO HANDING OVER THEIR BALLOTS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE REPORTS THE LOS ANGELES TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD IN AN EDITORIAL ENTITLED DON'T ALLOW VOTER COERCION AND CORRUPTION. TAKE HOLD IN CALIFORNIA OCALAN MAKERS TO AN ACT VOTER PROTECTIONS AND IT SPECIFICALLY URGED US TO RECONSIDER THE WISDOM OF ALLOWING UNKNOWN THIRD PARTIES. WITHOUT ANY IDENTIFICATION WITHOUT ANY TRACKING OR ANY RECEIPT TO COLLECT BALLOTS FROM VOTERS. BY ADOPTING THESE AMENDMENTS WE CAN PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS AND ENSURE THAT EVERY VOTE IS COUNTED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MR CALDERON YOU'RE RECOGNIZED MAKING MENACE I MOVE TO LAY THE AMENDMENTS ON THE TABLE. THANK YOU MR CALDERON MOVES AND MISTER GIBSON SECONDS AT THE AMENDMENTS BE LAID ON THE TABLE THE MOTION IS NOT DEBATABLE.

THE CLERK WILL CLOSE THE ROLE AND TALLY THE VOTES AYE AYES FORTY EIGHT. KNOWS TWENTY FOUR. THE MEASURE FAILS START WITH THE MOTION THE AMENDMENTS ARE LAID ON THE TABLE. BACK TO THE BILL THE CLERK WILL READ. SOME OF ALL THREE OF SIX BY SOME THE NUMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AND ACTUALLY TO ELECTIONS. GONZALEZ FLETCHER THANK YOU THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE CLEAN UP BILL LAST YEAR WE PASSED A A BILL THAT SAID A VOTER CAN DECIDE WHO CAN. WE LET THE VOTER AND ADULTS MAKE THE DECISION ON WHO THEY WANT TO HAVE TURN IN THE BALLOT. AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE A STAMP OR CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE MAILBOX OR. A FRIEND IS GOING TO GO TURN IN A BALLOT THEY GET TO MAKE THAT DECISION NOW A VERY ADULT DECISION. I'M ALL THIS BILL DOES IS SAY THAT PERSON SHOULD DO IT WITH IN. TWO DAYS WE REALIZE AFTER THE BILL WAS ENACTED. THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THEY COULD HOLD ONTO IT UNTIL ELECTION DAY WHICH COULD BE UP TO THIRTY DAYS SO THIS IS JUST AS A SIMPLE CLEAN UP BILL IN ONE THAT I THINK MAKES SENSE TO ALL OF US I RESPECT LAST FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER HARPER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT AS I POINTED OUT EARLIER. THE EDITORIAL BY THE LOS ANGELES TIMES ENTITLED DON'T ALLOW VOTER CORRUPTION AND COERCION TO TAKE PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. WAS VERY CLEAR IN IDENTIFYING THAT THERE WERE MULTIPLE PROBLEMS WITH THE ORIGINAL BILL ALLOWING BALLOT HARVESTING. THIS IS NOT A FIX THIS IS INCOMPLETE AND IT WOULD BE A SHAM TO BE TELLING THE VOTERS. THAT THIS WAS A FIX TO THE CLEARLY IDENTICAL PROP IDENTICAL PROBLEM OF COERCION. CORRUPTION AS WELL AS HARASSMENT. IF LEFT UNCHECKED THERE WILL BE NO PAPER TRAIL NO WAY TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. PEOPLE WHO WERE INTERFERING WITH THE BALLOT PROCESS IN NEGATIVE IN NEFARIOUS WAYS. WHETHER IT'S POLITICAL BOSSES. WHETHER IT'S UNION BOSSES. WEATHER IT'S ORGANIZED CRIME BOSSES. OR PERHAPS A BILLIONAIRE. EMPLOYING A LEGION OF GOONS TO COURSE BUT AND CORRUPT THE ELK THE BALLOT PROCESS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT OUR SYSTEM HAS THE INTEGRITY TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE INTO THE NEXT DECADES INSTEAD OF GOING BACK TO TAMMANY HALL STYLE CORRUPTION. OF BIG CITY BALLOT BOXES. MISS ONE DOSE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. SO THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS BILL I DID NOT VOTE FOR BECAUSE I AGREE THAT IT COULD LEAD TO BALLOT HARVESTING. AND CERTAINLY POSE SOME PROBLEMS WITH OUR ELECTIONS. HOWEVER. THIS BILL WHICH IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE AFFECTS. I WILL AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER THAT I DON'T THINK IT GOES FAR ENOUGH A RECEIPT WOULD BE GREAT SOME SORT OF PROOF ONE WITH THAT THIS WAS COLLECTED IN BY HIM WOULD BE GREAT. THAT'S NOT IN THIS BILL THAT DOES NOT MAKE THIS BILL. UNSUPPORTABLE IN MY ARMS. SOMETIMES WE TO TAKE BABY STEPS TO FIX THINGS. WE CAN'T HAVE IT ALL AT ONCE IT'S FRUSTRATING. I SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU. BUT DO WE SAY NO TO SOMETHING THAT IS ATTEMPTING TO MAKE. SMALL SPECKS ALBEIT NOT AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO SAY NO TO THAT BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE THE WHOLE THING I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE. THERE ARE LOTS OF BILLS ARE LOTS OF POLICIES AND LAWS A TO PUT IN PLACE IN THIS HOUSE THAT WE LATER. MAKE SOME AMENDMENTS TO THAT WE MAKE SOME FIXES TO WHETHER TO TECHNICAL CLEAN UP WHATEVER IT IS WE DO THAT ALL OF THE TIME. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. AGAIN. RESTATING. MY COMMENT THAT I DO SUPPORT THE BILL. IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING HORRIBLE. IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE A FIX SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER.
