TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:54.551
SOME OF THE OPPOSITION- I THINK

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:55.586
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF

00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:56.587
CONFUSION ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:58.622
THIS BILL THAT AND HOW IT

00:45:58.689 --> 00:45:59.389
OPERATED AND OBLIGATIONS THAT IT

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:00.824
MIGHT IMPOSE ON FOLKS WHICH-

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:02.593
WHICH WE CERTAINLY WANT HELP TO

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:03.393
CLARIFY- BUT WOULD DEFINITELY

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.294
WHAT WE'LL CONTINUE THIS

00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:08.298
CONVERSATION I GUESS I'M A

00:46:08.365 --> 00:46:09.199
LITTLE BIT MORE BULLISH. ON THE

00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:10.434
ABILITY OF. THE DMV TO

00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.903

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.071
IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:15.305
DIMINISH- ARE VETERANS YOU KNOW

00:46:15.372 --> 00:46:16.974
I NOTE THAT THE STATE OF GEORGIA

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:17.608
ALASKA CONNECTICUT HAVE ALREADY

00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:19.309
FIGURED OUT. HOW TO DO THIS- AND

00:46:19.376 --> 00:46:20.444
THOSE ARE STATES WITH VERY

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.279
STRONG TRADITIONS OF HONORING

00:46:22.346 --> 00:46:23.013

GEORGE R. ALASKA CONNECTICUT

WOUD HAVE DONE ANYTHING THAT

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:29.253
WOULD DIMINISH. THE ABILITY OF

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:31.188
U. U. S. VETERANS TO ACCESS

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:32.222

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:48.852
AWARE THAT THIS PARTICULAR

PROVISION OF THE BILL IS CAUSING

00:49:51.054 --> 00:49:52.823
HEARTBURN FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:49:52.889 --> 00:49:54.591

MEMBERS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I

00:50:08.038 --> 00:50:09.506
BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT

CONFRONTATION BETWEEN LAW

00:50:10.874 --> 00:50:12.609
ENFORCEMENT THE PUBLIC BEGINS

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:13.777
BECAUSE PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:15.145

SOLUTION TO THIS DILEMMA. THIS

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:26.456

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:24.007
STORY OF BEING PULLED OVER. I

00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:25.442
WAS ON MY WAY TO CHURCH WITH MY

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:27.110
TWO TEENAGE SONS DRIVING DOWN

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:29.045
TRAVIS BOULEVARD I WAS DRIVING%

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:30.413
AT THE SPEED OF TRAFFIC IT WAS

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.082
PULLED OVER. I IMMEDIATELY

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:33.416
CALLED INTO THE SLOW LANE A SLOW

00:52:33.483 --> 00:52:35.452
DOWN TO ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:36.486
PER HOUR AND BECAUSE THERE WAS

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:38.522
AN EMBANKMENT I DID NOT BILL I

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:40.323
COULD SAFELY PULL OFF THE ROAD

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.125
SO I DROVE TO THE NEXT EXIT.

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:43.627
WHEN THE OFFICER CAME OVER TO

00:52:43.693 --> 00:52:45.328
THE CAR I ASKED WHY HE PULLED ME

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:47.364
OVER AND HE ASKED ME WHY I

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:48.398
DIDN'T PULL OVER IMMEDIATELY

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:50.567
BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE. WANTS FROM

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:52.736
THEM THEY LIKELY HAVE GUNS AND

00:52:52.802 --> 00:52:54.571
DRUGS IN THE CAR HE THEN ASKED

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:57.173
ME FOR MY I. D. AND THE KIDS I'D

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.442
BE AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE CAME

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:00.377

GUN. MY KIDS ARE NOT IN GAINES

00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:18.328

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:21.096
REPRESENT- RIVERSIDE WHERE A LOT

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:22.564
OF THE GOODS AND UP MOVING

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:23.498
THROUGH. SO THE QUESTION TO THE

01:23:23.565 --> 01:23:27.135
OPPOSITION IS HOW. DO YOU

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:29.771
JUSTIFY ADDING ADDITIONAL

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:33.775
PENALTIES TO FOLKS WHO USE THOSE%

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.811
A FOR- OTHER TRANSPORTATION

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:40.582
WHEN- LENGTH OF TIME. IS NOT

01:23:40.648 --> 01:23:42.717
UNDER THEIR CONTROL YES SIR IT'S

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:45.420
A GREAT QUESTION SO THERE'S THE

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:48.256
TWO FOLD- IT IS ESSENTIALLY WHEN

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:49.991
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:51.359
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A CARGO

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:54.195
OWNER- AND OCEAN CARRIER ANY

01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:55.797
OTHER CARRIER FOR THAT MATTER

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.532
THERE'S A THERE'S A CONTRACT

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:58.533
THAT'S INVOLVED WITH RESPECT TO

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.168
BOTH THE CARRIAGE IN THE AND THE

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:03.438
INTERCHANGE OF THAT EQUIPMENT-

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:05.006
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS SPECIFY.

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:07.008
THE TERMS UNDER WHICH THOSE ARE

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:10.578
USE THEIR NEGOTIATED- THOSE ARE

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:13.114
SUBJECT TO FEDERAL LAW- SO TO

01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:14.749
THE EXTENT THAT ANYONE BELIEVE

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:16.718
THAT THOSE ARE DONE. IN A WAY

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:18.787
WHICH IS IMPROPER OR THEIR OWN

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:20.722
FAIR THIS COMPLAINT PROCESS FOR

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:22.257
THAT AND PEOPLE GO THROUGH THAT

01:24:22.323 --> 01:24:24.893
OUR MEMBERS ABIDE BY THAT- AND

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:27.796
HAVE BEEN FINED- AND THERE ARE

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:29.464
ACTIONS AGAINST THOSE FOR THESE

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:31.332
VERY SAME THINGS WHICH ARE BEING

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:32.901
COMPLAINED ABOUT HERE- I THINK

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:34.736
THE QUESTION FOR THIS BILL IS

01:24:34.803 --> 01:24:35.804
WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE WANTS

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:38.373
TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL LAYER. OF

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.008
STEPPING INTO THAT PROCESS AS

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:43.311
WELL- BUT THE BASIS FOR HOW YOU

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:46.281
MOVE CARGO IS A CONTRACT ON

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:48.249
THOSE TERMS ARE NEGOTIATED-

01:24:48.316 --> 01:24:49.784
WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTIES FEEL

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:51.219
LIKE TO HAVE THE BARGAINING

01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:52.520
POWER THAT THEY'RE OF THEY'RE

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.322
LOOKING FOR I THINK IS OBVIOUSLY

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:57.625
UP FOR DEBATE- BUT PEOPLE HAVE

01:24:57.692 --> 01:24:59.127
EYES WIDE OPEN MOVING NTO THAT

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:02.664
BUT WHAT I WILL SAY- MOVING INTO

01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:04.132
WHERE WE ARE AT THE PANDEMIC-

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:05.533
IS. WE ARE DEALING WITH

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.769
UNPRECEDENTED SITUATIONS- THEY

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:09.637
HAVE RESULTED IN ON PRESIDENT

01:25:09.704 --> 01:25:12.607
NANA FINDS. DISRUPTIONS AND

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:13.541
THINGS WHICH WERE NOT

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:16.110
ANTICIPATED SO THOSE THINGS HAVE

01:25:16.177 --> 01:25:17.111
TO WORK THEMSELVES THROUGH THIS

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:18.880
PROCESS. PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINTS

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.748
NEED TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:21.349
WITH SET UP UNDER FEDERAL LAW

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:23.251
ARE RIGHT NOW- AND THAT IS

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:25.453
OCCURRING- BUT THE FINES ARE NOT

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.590
A SURPRISE. TO FOLKS WHO ARE

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:29.190
OPERATING UNDER THE CONTRACT

01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:30.992
WHICH OUTLINES THE FINES OR

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:33.695
THEY'RE UNDER A TARIFF. ON WHICH

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:35.597
ALREADY EXISTS AND HAS BEEN

01:25:35.663 --> 01:25:37.465
APPROVED BY A PORT- BUT I THINK

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:39.567
IN TERMS OF WHERE WE'RE SITTING

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:41.603
RIGHT NOW. THOSE OF THOSE ARE

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:42.971
NOT AGAIN NOT A SURPRISE TO

01:25:43.037 --> 01:25:44.239
ANYONE ON THE KNOW WHAT THE

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:46.875
TERMS ARE- THE QUESTION IS

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:48.109
WHETHER OR NOT THE APPLICATION

01:25:48.176 --> 01:25:50.578
OF THOSE THOSE ARE FAIR- AND

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:51.412
THEN WHO'S GOING TO BE THE

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:54.182
ARBITER. OF WHETHER NOT THEIR

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:58.653
FAIR WINNER POST. THANK YOU I

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.055
DON'T KNOW IF THE- SIDE WANTS TO

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:06.694
RESPOND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:07.929
ARMENIANS QUESTION AND MISTER

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.964
JACOBS RESPONSE YOU KNOW- WE

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:12.700
WOULD JUST SAY THAT- SB FORTY

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:14.269
FIVE WAS PASSED IN THE STATE OF

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:15.503
CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:16.771
FIVE AND SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.206
WE ARE STILL HAVING DISCUSSIONS

01:26:18.273 --> 01:26:20.174
ABOUT THE FAIRNESS OF DETENTION

01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:22.810
DEMURRAGE AND SO. WE DO BELIEVE

01:26:22.877 --> 01:26:24.812
THAT THE FINAL DISCUSSIONS ARE

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:26.381
PRODUCTIVE IN THE COMMITTEE

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:28.483
AMENDMENTS WILL ENSURE THAT-

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:29.684
WHATEVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:31.653
DOES OR DOES NOT END UP DOING IS

01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:33.187
ALIGNED WITH THOSE FEDERAL

01:26:33.254 --> 01:26:35.390
EFFORTS SO I THINK THERE'S WIDE

01:26:35.456 --> 01:26:36.691
RECOGNITION THAT A DETENTION

01:26:36.758 --> 01:26:38.259
DEMURRAGE NEEDS- FOR THE

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:41.396
SCRUTINY- IN THE FAIRNESS OF

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:43.965
THOSE FEES- NEEDS TO BE

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:45.600
ASSESSED. THANK YOU. MISTER

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:47.869
GIBSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH I

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:52.307
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION- AND

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:54.275
ONE WHO REPRESENTS THE YOU KNOW

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:57.245
FOR LOS ANGELES- AND THE GOODS

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:59.247
MOVEMENT COMING IN AND OUT- I

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:01.816
THINK WE I AND I'VE BEEN WITH

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.885
AND MET WITH AND TAKEN TOURS OF

01:27:03.952 --> 01:27:06.354
BUSINESSES OF SOMETIME THERE ARE

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:10.391
OUT OF THE OUT OF- ONES- CONTROL

01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:13.494
IF A SHIP DECIDES THEY DON'T

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:15.263
WANT ANYMORE CAN IN CONTAINERS.

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:16.831
THEN THOSE COMPANIES HAVE TO

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:19.734
HOLD THEM AND THEY HAVE TO HOLD

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:22.403
THEM AND KERR THE COSTS. OF AND

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:24.372
NOW AND THEN TO BE PENALIZED AS

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:26.174
A RESULT OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.776
I THINK THIS IS TRYING TO GET AT

01:27:28.843 --> 01:27:31.980
THE CRUX. OF MAKING SURE- THAT

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:32.814
WHEN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.450
HAPPEN THAT THEY DON'T THEY'RE

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:38.886
NOT UNFAIRLY- PENALIZED BECAUSE

01:27:38.953 --> 01:27:41.990
IF A SHIP REJECTED FOR WHATEVER

01:27:42.056 --> 01:27:42.657
REASON BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:44.892
THEY CAN. ARM THERE IS THE

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:48.763
BURDENS ON THE- OWNER OR WHO

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:51.232
OWNS THE CONTAINERS AND SOMETIME

01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:53.468
THEY CAN SIT FOR DAYS I'M AT A

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:55.803
TIME UNTIL WHATEVER THEY FEEL

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:57.572
LIKE ASKING FOR THOSE CONTAINERS

01:27:57.639 --> 01:28:00.808
TO BE UP TO BE BROUGHT FORTH.

01:28:00.875 --> 01:28:02.043
AND I THINK THAT. WE'RE TRYING

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.244
TO DO HERE IS MAKING SURE THAT

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:05.079
THESE ARE BUSINESSES STAY

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:08.850
AFLOAT- BUT ALSO I HEARD THE

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:11.285
AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK-

01:28:11.352 --> 01:28:12.820
AND TRYING TO FIND A MIDDLE

01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:15.490
GROUND- SO THAT WE CAN LEAST

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:16.958
ADDRESS THIS NOT THINK THIS.

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:18.393

YOUR EXACTLY CORRECT- WE HAVE A

01:28:38.179 --> 01:28:40.948
CONGESTION CRISIS- AND WE DO

HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE CANNOT

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:46.287
ACCEPT- BOXES THE TERMINALS ARE

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:48.089
FULL. A AND THERE IS A

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.758
CONSEQUENCES. AND THAT THAT IS

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.360
PHYSICALLY OCCURRING RIGHT YOU

HAPPENS WITH THOSE CONTRACTS AND

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:05.940

THOSE QUESTIONS- SO ARE QUITE

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:12.213
OUR OUR ISSUE WITH THE BILL

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.881
FRANKLY IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:16.751
THERE SHOULD BE A PROCESS FOR

RESOLVING THOSE CLAIMS- IT'S

01:29:17.985 --> 01:29:19.687

WHAT'S REASONABLE AND FAIR. AND

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:30.398
THOSE WILL BE ONGOING

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:31.499

LANDFILLING OR OPEN BURNING THAT

01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:52.545

URGENT THING WE CAN DO TO

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:05.525
ALSO THE SAME MEASURES THAT CAN

01:51:05.592 --> 01:51:06.559
PROVIDE CARBON NEGATIVE

01:51:06.626 --> 01:51:07.694
