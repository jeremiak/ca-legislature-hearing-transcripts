IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY POLICY FOR CERTAIN IMMIGRATION OFFENSES. AND THE WORLD WATCHED ON IS THIS POLICY RESULTED IN THE FORCED SEPARATION OF THOUSANDS OF MIGRANT FAMILIES AT THE BORDER. THE RESULTING TRAUMA AT THE SEPARATIONS COUPLED WITH THE CONFUSION OF NAVIGATING OUR COUNTRY'S COMPLEX IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. HAS UNDERSCORED THE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR THE MOTIONAL CULTURAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THESE FAMILIES. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN A LEADER IN SUPPORTING OUR IMMIGRANT POPULATION. AND HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF POLICIES AND PROGRAMS AND TO PROVIDING FOR THEIR LEGAL EDUCATION AND HEALTHY. WELL COURT ORDERS HAVE MANDATED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REUNIFY. AND PROVIDE FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF FAMILIES SEPARATED AT THE BORDER. THERE IS STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THE SUPPORT SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANT POPULATION ARE ADEQUATE. AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES AND CULTURAL NEEDS. AT TODAY'S HEARING WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THE HISTORY OF FAMILY SEPARATIONS. CALIFORNIA'S ROLE IN ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF IMMIGRANT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AND HOW FORCED FAMILY SEPARATIONS CAN RESULT IN TRAUMA AND LIFELONG FF. WE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WORKING TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN AND FEDERAL IMMIGRATION CAPACITY. THAT ARE WORKING TO LOCATE AND REUNIFY FAMILIES THAT REMAIN SEPARATED. AND ARE WORKING TO CONTINUE TO COORDINATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THESE FAMILIES. FINALLY WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW CALIFORNIA. AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN FURTHER SUPPORT OUR IMMIGRANT POPULATION. AS WELL AS ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE DOING THE DIFFICULT AND TREMENDOUS WORK OF SERVING THE FAMILIES. THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO JOIN US. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE GERMAN STONE FOR ANY OPENING REMARKS YOU MAY WISH TO CONTRIBUTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY. AND LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR PUTTING TOGETHER A GREAT BACKGROUND PAPER THAT REALLY LAYS OUT. THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN HERE. THIS LEGISLATURE BOTH YOUR COMEDIAN MINE SEEN A NUMBER OF BILLS GO THROUGH TRYING TO PROTECT. PEOPLE AT OUR BORDERS. AND YET CALIFORNIA HAVING TO STEP UP AND SPEND MONEY. REALLY IN RESPONSE TO FAIL FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICY REGRESSION POLICY THAT LEAVES FAMILIES AND KIDS SEPARATED AT THE BORDER. THESE CHILDREN CAGES SET UP IN HUMANE AND UNACCEPTABLE SITUATIONS SO FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT. WHAT THE REALITIES ON THE GROUND. TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE. COMING AND GOING THE CALIFORNIA AND IN PEOPLE WHO. OUR ECONOMY REALLY RELIES ON OUR ECONOMY OUR COMMUNITIES FUNCTION BECAUSE OF. THE IMMIGRANTS WHO COME. AND WEBER FIELDS AND WORK IN OUR HOTELS AND WORK. IN OUR RESTAURANTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE A BABY BENFORD GENERATIONS PART PARCEL OF REALLY WHO CALIFORNIA IS AND BECAUSE OF A FAILURE FEDERAL POLICY IN A BLACK ON WILLING TO WRECK. WHAT THREE IS FOR CALIFORNIA AND MANY OF THE BORDER STATES WE HAVING TO STEP IN AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING PEOPLE. WHO ARE COMING INTO OUR FAIR STATE AND- OFTEN VERY GOOD REASON. SO UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGES TO POLICIES AND I'M HOPEFUL THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL DO THAT. AND REALLY DEMILITARIZED IS CUSTOMS AND IMMIGRATION AND PUTS IT BACK TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION THAT IT HAD BEEN FOR GENERATIONS AND SUDDENLY IT BECOMES A PARAMILITARY FORCE THAT IS MORE INTENT ON KEEPING PEOPLE OUT. TREATING PEOPLE AS- WE WOULD NEVER WANT TO SEE PEOPLE BEING TREATED. UNTIL THAT CHANGES WE'RE GOING TO STILL CONTINUE TO NEED TO STEP UP AND FIGURE OUT WHAT RESOURCES AND POLICIES WE CAN BRING TO BEAR. TO HELP THESE PEOPLE OUT. TO THE BEST EXTENT THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY LOOK FORWARD. TO THE WITNESSES NORMALLY IN A HEARING LIKE THIS WE WOULD HAVE. WITNESSES ON HAS A STABLE SIDES ARE ALL SIGNS. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD BE. TO DO. THE INHUMANE POLICIES HAVE PUT US IN THE CITY. SO I LOOK FORTY HEARING FROM SPEAKERS. AND WHAT MAKES STEPS WHAT MORE WE CAN DO EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LAST FEW TO DO OUR BEST TO FOR TO SEE WHAT MORE WE CAN DO. TO PROTECT PEOPLE COMING IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN SOUTH I BEFORE I OPEN IT UP TO OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'D ALSO LIKE TO INVITE MAJORITY LEADER REYES TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS AS A FORMER CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE. MAJORITY LEADER REYES HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR CALIFORNIA MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THANK YOU SO. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR. I DO WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR PUTTING ON THIS SUCH AN IMPORTANT HEARING AND FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK AT THIS TIME ON THIS YEAR. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FAMILY SEPARATION IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BRING UP THE RACIST AND HATEFUL MESSAGES. THAT HAVE BEEN SENT TO OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE. I THINK WE IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY HAVE HEARD THIS MESSAGE SO MANY TIMES WE'VE HEARD ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THIS POLICY BUT IT BEARS REPEATING AGAIN. NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S A RACIST POLICY BUT JUST. NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE BAD POLICY BUT BECAUSE IT'S A MORAL FAILURE. FOR A COUNTRY. WE ESTIMATE THAT AS A RESULT OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY. OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED CHILDREN WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES. THE STAFF REPORT MENTIONED THAT IN MY FULL CHILDREN INCLUDING BABIES WERE HELD IN DEPLORABLE AND UNSANITARY CONDITIONS AND QUOTE. IMPACTED BY THIS POLICY WERE UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE. THESE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE OUR NEIGHBORS OUR FRIENDS MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. IT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT ONLY ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN BUT ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED IT. MUCH HAS TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS THE HARM DONE. BUT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PRIORITIZE SUPPORTING REUNITING THESE FAMILIES WHO ARE HERE SEEKING ASYLUM A LEGAL REQUEST. AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO SHARE THAT I HAVE MOVED TO INTRODUCED AB FORTY SEVEN WHICH WOULD COORDINATE SUPPORT OF SERVICES AND LINK EXISTING RESOURCES TO FAMILIES WHO WERE SEPARATED AT THE BORDER. MUST CONTINUE TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO ASSIST FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN AFFETED BY FAMILY SEPARATION AND I THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THANK YOU MADAM MAJORITY LEADER. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO INVITE ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO MAKE OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND ALSO TO OUR- OUR OTHER CHAIR- THANK YOU FOR PUTTING IS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING ON- THIS ONE ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT A MAJORITY LEADER HAD ALREADY INDICATED- YOU KNOW AMERICA HAS A VERY CHECKERED PAST BECAUSE- I CAN REMEMBER GOING BACK IN HISTORY. WHERE AFRICAN AMERICAN- CHILDREN WERE TAKEN AWAY AND SOLD INTO SLAVERY- AND THEN WE HAVE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE HAVE. KIDS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THE PARENTS AND BEING PLACED IN CAGES IN A VERY INHUMANE KIND OF TREATMENT. AND WE HOPE THAT THIS THIS HISTORY WHEN EVERY REPEATED AGAIN THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THE KIND OF HARD WORK THE HEAVY LIFTING TO MAKING SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN EVER AGAIN IN THIS COUNTRY AGAIN. AND SO IT IS TO THAT END THAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS TOPIC I'M EXCITED- THAT WE'RE TAKING ON THE WHOLE TOPIC SO THAT WE CAN ONE LET CALIFORNIANS KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO LEAD THE WAY IN THE SPACE BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE WRITE A NEW NARRATIVE MOVING FORWARD. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IMMIGRATION AND ALSO THE DREAM OF OUR CHILDREN AND I WANT TO GET TO ASK QUESTIONS OF OUR PANELISTS- BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL MISSING CHILDREN WHO ARE DISPLACED WHO ARE NOT CONNECTS THEIR FAMILIES AND TO THEIR TO THEIR PARENTS THAT I'M QUITE CONCERNED WITH AND SO.

I WANT TO PLEASE HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF THE PRESENTATION OF EACH PANEL. WE WILL NOW TURN TO OUR FIRST SPEAKER DAN THE WINDOW WITH THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION IMMIGRATIONS RIGHTS PROJECT. WELCOME DANCE. HI THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME IT'S NICE TO BE HERE AT LEAST TO BE VIRTUALLY BACK IN CALIFORNIA. I AM A STAFF ATTORNEY IN THE IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS PROJECT THE ACLU FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS I HAVE WORKED ON- THE MISS ELAPIDAE GEISHA- THE LAWSUIT THAT FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO REUNIFY THOUSANDS OF MIGRANT FAMILIES. AND DECLARED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES UNCONSTITUTIONAL- TODAY WE KNOW THAT MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED FAMILIES WERE RIPPED APART BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WE KNOW FAMILIES WERE SEPARATED EVEN MORE APPARENT WAS NEVER PROSECUTED FOR A CRIME ANY FOR THE FAMILY PRESENTED ITSELF TO A PORT OF ENTRY INSIDE A SILO. WE KNOWN AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS KNEW AT THE TIME. THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND NO CONFIDENT WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF THE SEPARATIONS AND SELECTED. ORATORY UNIFY FAMILIES QUICKLY. EVERY STEP OF TRYING TO HELP THESE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN MADE HARDER. BY THE CHAOS AND CRUELTY OF THIS POLICY. A COVER THREE TOPICS FIRST A TIMELINE FOR THIS BILL POLICY IN CONTEXT FOR HOW IT MARKED A DRASTIC CHANGE. SECOND OF THE CURRENT STATE OF EFFORTS TO CONTACT HELP FAMILIES STUDENTS L. AND THIRD A QUICK MENTION OF KEY STEPS THAT WE HAVE ASKED THE BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE. BUT TO UNDERSTAND HOW RARE SEPARATING A CHILD FROM THEIR PARENTS USED TO BE. LESS THAN A THIRD OF 1% OF ALL CHILDREN REFERRED TO THE CARE THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT. WHICH CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM PARENTS AS OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. PRIOR TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WHEN SEPARATIONS HAPPEN IN THAT ERA IT WAS FOR A MEDICALEMERGENCY FOR EXAMPLE OR THE RARE CASE OF APPARENT PROPOSED A CURRENT THREATS TO THEIR CHILD'S. THE OF SEPARATED CHILDREN- ARE ARE- INCREASED MORE THAN TENFOLD IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BEGAN EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PROSECUTED FOR ILLEGAL ENTRY OR RE ENTRY. TO TRY TO TIE THE PROGRAM A SUCH PROSECUTIONS IN THE EL PASO SECTOR THE RESULTANT SEPARATIONS A FAMILY. THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS AND HIS. BUT SOME OF THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS AND HIS OFFICE DROVE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SEPARATION POLICY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT'S THE RECENT CONCLUSION OF A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT. THAT REPORT- AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE RELYING ON THE NOTES OF SEVERAL PROSECUTORS AT A TWENTY EIGHTEEN. MAY TWENTY EIGHTEEN MEETING QUOTED SESSION SAYING TO THE PROSECUTORS QUOTE WE NEED TO TAKE AWAY CHILDREN. SHE WOULD GO ON TO ANNOUNCE THE FORMAL ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY- IN MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH RELIED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO REFER AS MANY ADULTS AS POSSIBLE FOR PROSECUTION. WHICH THEN LEADS THEIR CHILDREN BEING TAKEN FROM THEM WHILE IT WAS BEING PROSECUTED AND THEN THE SUBSEQUENT ORDEALS OF ATTEMPTING TO UNIFY AND GET THESE FAMILIES BACK TOGETHER- MEANWHILE WE WERE LITIGATING MISS L. AND A MONTH LATER IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE JUDGE IN THAT CASE. ORDERED THE GOVERNMENT TO REUNITE FAMILIES AND DECLARED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES. PRACTICES UNCONSTITUTIONAL CALLING THEM BRUTAL AND HOLDING THAT THAT SHOCKS- CHECKS THE CONSCIENCE. POINT OF ALL THE CHILDREN STILL IN OR CARE NEARLY A QUARTER OF THEM WERE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM A PARENT. NOW I SAID EARLIER THE TOTAL NUMBER THIS POINT IS MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED- IT INCLUDES ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED THEN IN GOVERNMENT CARE. ACCORDING TO SELL HAD ORDERED TO BE REUNIFIED IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES TWO OTHER GROUPS. ONE IS THE OLDEST SEPARATIONS WHERE THE CHILDREN WERE ALREADY OUT OF GOVERNMENT CARE BY THE TIME OF THE JUDGE'S ORDER. THAT GROUP WAS REVEALED ONLY LATE IN TWENTY NINETEEN AFTER INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORTS AND AFTER THE WAR IN MICELLE REQUIRED THE GOVERNMENT TO ACCOUNTS WITH THEM. THIS GROUP IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX CHILDREN AND FINDING THEM AND THEIR PARENTS HAS BEEN MUCH OF THE FOCUS OF OUR CURRENT WORK. THEY'RE ALSO SEPARATIONS AFTER. THE JUNE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND JUNCTION. SO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PURSUED SEPARATIONS EVEN AFTER THE COURT'S INJUNCTION DOING SO LARGELY BY CLAIMING EXCEPTIONS TO THE JUDGE'S ORDER THE MOST COMMON ONE WAS TO CLAIM THAT A PARENT'S CRIMINAL RECORD. EVEN IF MINOR. MEET THE PARENT A DANGER TO THE CHILD OR MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THE FAMILY WITH OTHER FAMILIES IN DETENTION. THESE SEPARATIONS. TOTAL ELEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE CHILDREN. ONE FINAL AND WHOLLY SEPARATE- NUMBER THAT I KNOW WILL BE OF INTEREST OF COMMITTEES- AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX PARENTS OF SEPARATED CHILDREN ARE BELIEVED TO BE IN. CALIFORNIA. OUR MOVE TO CURRENT EFFORTS. THIS FALL WE REPORTED THAT HUNDREDS OF THE OLDEST SEPARATIONS I THOUGHT THAT THE FAMILIES HAS NOT BEEN LOCATED YET. THE KEY REASONS SO MANY FAMILIES HAVE NOT BEEN REACHED YET IS BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FAILED TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT COULD HAVE HELPED US. FIND THESE FAMILIES. WHEN WE DID RECEIVE INFORMATION IN TWENTY NINETEEN ABOUT THE SEPARATIONS SOME OF THE CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY AND WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS. MAKING THINGS WORSE THE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE FAMILIES WE CAN WE WILL STILL TO PAY OR NONEXISTENT. I'M GOING TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT TO DRINK WATER. SO WHILE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND MOST FAMILIES EVEN WITH THE LIMITED INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE- AS OF THIS AFTERNOON- THE NUMBER IS THE PARENTS OF SIX HUNDRED CHILDREN HAVE YET TO BE LOCATED- AND OF THOSE SIX HUNDRED ABOUT ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED OF THEM ARE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO REACH THESE PARENTS HOPE TO MAKE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN THE COMING MONTHS NOW THAT. YET AGAIN- THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAD RECENTLY AND BELATEDLY DISCLOSED ADDITIONAL CONTACT INFORMATION FIRST. I WANT TO QUICKLY MENTION THE KEY ASKS WE HAVE MADE TO THE BY THE ADMINISTRATION- OF WHICH WE HOPE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL TAKE UP AS WELL IN THEIR ADVOCACY TO FEDERAL OFFICIALS. FIRST IS TO REUNITE ALL FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ENSURE THEY LIVE HERE TOGETHER THREE FROM DETENTION. THE BINDING MINISTRATION HAS THE POWER TO ROLL THESE FAMILIES INTO THE COUNTRY. ALLOWING THEM TO REUNITE AND SAFETY HERE. SECOND DISTRICT TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE PROTECTIONS FROM DEPORTATION FOR FAMILIES ALREADY HERE OR FOR THOSE THAT ARE BROUGHT HERE TO UNITE. AND THEN TO SUPPORT A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR ALL SEPARATED FAMILIES. THERE IS A FUND TO PROVIDE BASIC NECESSITIES INCLUDING TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. FOR IT IS SYSTEMIC CHANGES TO ENSURE AN ENDS TO FAMILY SEPARATIONS FOR. TO CLOSE I WANT TO BE SURE NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TRAGEDIES OF FAMILY SEPARATION- I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO THE STORIES AND I HOPE YOU WILL REMEMBER THEM- SUCH AS ONE OF THE FIRST REUNITED FAMILIES IN OUR CASE. HIS MOTHER TOLD US THAT HER FOUR YEAR OLD SON KEPT ASKING IF THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE HIM AWAY AGAIN. FOR THE PARENTS TO THEIR CHILDREN WOULD BE TAKEN. AND ASKED GOVERNMENT AGENTS FOR A MOMENT TO GRACE THE CHILD FOR WHAT WAS ABOUT TO BE. TO HAPPEN. ONLY TO BE TOLD NO. OR THE MOTHER WHO WAS FORCED TO WATCH AS OFFICERS DROVE AWAY WITH HER EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD. WELL MAYBE TRY TO GET ONE LAST GLIMPSE OF HER. IT IS THESE ACCOUNTS THAT SHOULD MOTIVATE US TO DO RIGHT BY THESE FAMILIES- AND ALSO FOR QUESTIONS AND- ONCE AGAIN THANKS FOR HAVING ME AND HAVING SOMEONE FROM THE ACLU.

THANK YOU MISS TEN OUR NEXT PRESENTER IS pRYAN MATLOW CLINICAL ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D LIKE TO START BY THINKING THIS JOIN ASSEMBLY FOR ATENDING TO THE RECEPTION CARE DIMINISH OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA. GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY SHARE MY EXPERIENCES AND OBSERVATIONS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BEING. OF THIS COMMUNITY. SO I WAS OUTSIDE COLLEGES MY WORK FOCUSES ON ADDRESSING AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF TELECOM ADVERSITY I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH IMMIGRANT YOUTH AND FAMILIES PRIMARILY FROM CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS. CONDUCTING TRAUMA FOCUSED CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION. IN PARTICULAR. IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE SPECIFIC IMPACT US GOVERNMENT POLICY AND PRACTICE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING OF CHILDREN FAMILIES SEEKING REFUGE INCLUDING THOSE IMPACTED BY IT ZERO TOLERANCE BY THE PROLIFERATION OF CHILD DETENTION. MY REMAIN MEXICO POLICIES BY CURRENT ASYLUM. THIS WORK IS INVOLVED VISITS TO CUSTODY SETTINGS IN DIRECT CONVERSATIONS WITH CHILDREN WHILE THEY'RE DETAINED IN THE MIDST OF ONGOING SEPARATION FROM THE CHARACTERS. AS WELL AS WORK WITH FAMILIES NAVIGATING. A CHALLENGING PROCESS TO REMOVE OF REUNIFICATION FOLLOWING GOVERNMENT PLUS SEPARATION. I'VE BEEN HONORED AND GRATEFUL TO BE PRESENT WITH THESE FAMILIES AS THEY SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES AND STRUGGLES MANY OF WHOM WONDER STORIES TO BE TOLD. WITH THIS WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO LISTEN. IN THIS WORK I'VE BEEN BOTH STRUCK AN INCREDIBLE RESILIENCE SHOWN BY KIDS AND FAMILIES IS IT PERSEVERED THROUGH MULTIPLE ADVERSITIES AND TRAUMAS. THE RAIN FROM TARGETED VIOLENCE EXPOSURE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES OF ORIGIN. GEN TO THE THREAT RISK AN ADDITIONAL BALLOTS EXPOSURE EXPERIENCED DURING THE MIGRATION JOURNEY. TO THE UNANTICIPATED TRAUMAS EXPERIENCED AT THE HANDS OF US GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS UPON ARRIVAL. THROUGH THIS CHILDREN THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS I REMAIN HOPEFUL FOR FUTURE OF SAFETY AND SECURITY. AND COMMITTED TO THEIR FMILIES WELL BEING AND THEY REMAIN OPEN TO BOTH RECEIVING AND GIVING SUPPORT. AND TO BUILDING COMMUNITY DURING THE TIME OF CRITICAL NEED IN CRISIS. THIS IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE. HOWEVER THE IMPACTS OF US POLICY IN PRACTICE PARTICULARLY SEPARATION UNDERMINES RESILIENCE IT IS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF AIMS TO PURSUE THE BEST INTERESTS OF CHILDREN. FIRST MOMENTS OF THE FOURTH FAMILY SEPARATION ARE MARKED BY ACUTE AND SEVERE DISTRESS INCLUDING INCLUDING PANIC CONFUSION AND DISEMPOWER. SH CAN BARELY MEMBERS ARE GIVEN INFORMATION ON THE RATIONALE NATURE AND COURSES OF SEPARATION IN THE FREQUENTLY BEEN MISLED- WORST AND SOMETIMES PHYSICALLY TORN ONE ANOTHER'S ARMS BY IMMIGRATION AGENTS. AS EXPERIENCES BECOME IMPRINTED IN THEIR MEMORIES AND PSYCHOLOGY. DENNIS EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE IN THIS CONTEXT IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WE KNOW THE TRAUMA IS SUBJECT. WHAT MAKES A CHALLENGE OR POTENTIAL THREAT DRAMATIC IS NOT KNOWING WHAT IS HAPPENING AND NOT FEELING A SENSE OF AGENCY TO AFFECT THE OUTCOME. AND THIS RESULTS IN EXTREME FEAR ANXIETY AND DYSREGULATION BOOKS FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. THAT BECOME SUSTAIN DROP PROCESSING IN CUSTODY IN A SYSTEM THAT IS UNFAMILIAR AND OFTEN THREATEN. WITH KIDS AND CAREGIVERS A DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING TRADITIONAL SUPPORTS. OVERTIMES INCITING PANIC BECOME ACCOMPANIED BY SANDERS DESPAIR AND HOPELESSNESS. SPOKEN WITH TEENAGERS IN CUSTODY INSTEAD THEY'RE SPENDING EVERY DAY ONE ABOUT THE CARE GIVERS WHEREABOUTS AND WHERE WE AND WELL BEING. THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FOCUS ON ANYTHING ELSE AND EVERY DAY THEY BREAK DOWN IN TEARS BECAUSE THERE HELP ME FEEL HELPLESS TO DO ANYTHING. THIS IS NO WAY FOR A CHILD TO BE SPENDING CRITICAL FORMATIVE DEVELOPMENTAL YEARS. AS THESE REACTIONS TO THE TRAUMA OF SEPARATION BECOMING GREAT. INDEED DECADES OF RESEARCH ON CHILDHOOD TRAUMA ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES A TOXIC STRESS. AND SHOWN THE EXPERIENCES OF SEVERE BELONGS RIGHT IN THE ABSENCE OF PROTECTIVE CARE GIVING SUPPORTS IN SESSIONS LASTING PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM. WITH LITERAL ALTERATIONS IN BRAIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION. AS WELL AS IMPAIRMENT BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING THE IMPACT LONG TERM HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES. JONES LEFT UNADRESSED WE CAN EXPECT THESE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN IMPACTED BY SEPARATION PRACTICES. HE WHAT PART OF CHILDREN'S RESILIENCE IS THAT THE ADAPTING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY ARE AT BUT ADAPTATIONS THE HARMFUL CIRCUMSTANCES PROPELLED AMERICAN OTHER CONTEXTS AND ALTERATIONS IN A CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORY THAT ARE BASED ON EXTREME AND CHRONIC THREAT OF SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. IN HUMANE SOCIETY IT IS IN NOBODY'S BEST INTEREST PER CHILD TO EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS THAT I AM IN DANGER. THERE'S NOBODY NOBODY TO PROTECT ME AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO TO HELP MYSELF OR MY LOVED ONES. THESE PATTERNS OF TRAUMA RELATED COGNITION AND AFFECT IN THE SOCIAL BEHAVIORS CLEARLY IMPACT ENGAGEMENT IN SCHOOLS AND HEALTH CARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IN IN THE DISTRESS OF SEPARATION WE SEE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS IN PARENT CHILD ATTACHMENT WHICH IS THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN CHILDREN AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. THAT IS FOUNDATIONAL FOR HEALTHY CHILD ABOUT. FOR SEPARATION BREAKS THE BONDS OF TRUST AND SECURITY IN A RELATIONSHIP. AND EVEN WELL AFTER REUNIFICATION THERE'S LASTING DISTRESS AND PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIPS AND FAMILY FUNCTION. WHAT WE IN TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THE CONFUSION OF SEPARATION CHILDREN MAY COME TO BLAME THEMSELVES OR THEIR CAREGIVERS AND OUTCOMES OF IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. THIS CAN LEAD TO LASTING SHAME ANGER RESENTMENT AND FAMILY CONFLICT. IT CAN TAKE YEARS OF THERAPEUTIC WORK TO RESTORE A SENSE OF SAFETY AND STABILITY AND CONSISTENCY IN THE PARENT CHILD ATTACHMENT. AND IMPACT IS COOLEY BIDIRECTIONAL AFFECTING PARENTS AS WELL. IN ADDITION TO THE LASTING TRAUMA SPENDING FOR A LONG TIME NOT KNOWING IF YOUR CHILD IS OKAY BEING RENDERED HELPLESS TO PROTECT THEM FROM HARM. THE PROCESS OF REUNIFICATION IS OFF THE MARK RICHARD OR STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND AND TO RECOGNIZE THE CHILD. STRUGGLING TO JIM JOHNSON AND BEHAVIOR STEMMING FROM THE SEPARATION. AND STRUGGLING WITH THEIR OWN FEELINGS OF SHAME AND GUILT THAT AFFECTS RENTAL EFFECTIVENESS. AND WHILE THE HARMS MAYBE DIRE THERE REMAIN OPPORTUNITIES FOR STABILIZATION RECOVERY GROWTH AND HEALING THAT CAPITALIZE ON THE RESILIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE IMMIGRANT CHILDREN FAMILIES. THESE OUTCOMES ARE NOT YET DETERMINED. JUST TO NAME A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF PROCESS OF RECOVERY STARTED HEARING CAPTURING ANY KNOWLEDGE IN FAMILIES EXPERIENCES. AND IMPACTS OF THESE INTENTIONAL STRATEGIES TO DETER THE PURSUIT OF SAFETY SECURITY AND HEALTH. AND BY GIVING CHILDREN FAMILIES AGENCY IN PARTICULAR THEIR NEEDS AND TO INFORM OUR RESPONSE. WE ALSO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO PURSUE POLICY TO PREVENT A REPETITION OF THESE HARMS. IN MOST PRACTICAL IMPORTANTLY TO HELP RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS OF CARE THE COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESSED NEEDS LASTING AND COMPLEX NEEDS OF CHILDREN FAMILIES AFFECTED BY SEPARATION PRACTICES. SO I HEARD OUR STATE AND OUR POLICYMAKERS THROUGH GAUGING EFFORTS TOWARDS THESE ENDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DOCTOR ABOUT LOW. I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I WOULD NOW LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS- IF ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS I HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONE. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- THE STATISTICS THERE WERE PROVIDED I DO THIS IS FOR ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL. YES THE STATISTICS GIVEN I KNOW HER VERY WELL I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY CHILDREN STILL ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS HAVE NOT BEEN REUNITED WITH THEIR PARENTS. THAT ANYONE ON THE PANEL CAN ANSWER MISTER GLENDORA THINK HAVE PROVIDED. YEAH I CAN I CAN BE I CAN BEGIN TO ANSWER THAT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR THE QUESTION IS ESSENTIALLY THAT THERE IS A LARGE GROUP OF CHILDREN THE SIX HUNDRED PERRANCE- PARENTS OF CHILDREN SEPARATED BUT WE HAVEN'T REACHED THE PARENT SO IN THAT SENSE WE DON'T KNOW. THE STATUS OF THE FAMILY SO THAT SO ESSENTIALLY THERE IS SUCH A LARGE GROUP. OR HOME NOT SURE WHAT THEIR STATUS IS IN WITHOUT REACHING THE PARENT WHO CAN'T FIGURE THAT OUT. THAT IT MAKES ANY SORT OF PRECISE NUMBER- QUITE QUITE DIFFICULT UNFORTUNATELY SO. WE HOPE TO GET. ESPECIALLY GIVEN JUST THE- OVER ARCHING THE SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF SEPARATION. WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE THAT KIND OF CLARITY AND I KIND OF NUMBER WHILE THERE IS STILL A LARGE POOL OF CHILDREN- FOR WHOM WE HAVEN'T REACHED THEIR FAMILIES IT IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT. TO DO SO. AND AS A FOLLOW PERFORMING THAT MEASURE. JEFF IS AN ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT TODAY- THE VICE ADMINISTRATION HAS COMMITTED TO WORKING TO REUNITE THE CHILDREN WITH THEIR PARENTS DOES THIS GIVE YOU MORE HOPE DONE AND FINDING THESE PARENTS AND GETTING THEM TOGETHER WITH THEIR CHILDREN. YES ABSOLUTELY IT IT- YOU KNOW IT IT IT HAS BEEN. DISCUSSED FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND BEEN PART OF- NO- NOW PRESIDENT BIDEN'S- CAMPAIGN WAS TO PLEDGE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND TO TAKE CONCRETE STEPS SO- YOU KNOW. IN VERY TANGIBLE FORM- WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING- UPDATED INFORMATION AND UPDATED CONTACT INFORMATION FOR FAMILIES FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND SO- PLEDGE TO HELP TO DO SO IN TWO. ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS AND- COOPERATE WITH IT AND TRY TO MOVE IT FORWARD IS A VERY VERY WELCOME CHANGE. THANK YOU MISTER GLENDALE DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER MISTER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RUN CHAIR MISTER GLENDALE I HAVE A QUESTION A FOLLOW UP ON- REGARDING THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN SEPARATED I UNDERSTAND FROM A NEW YORK- THE NEW YORK TIMES IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE- CHILDREN. AND THIS WAS BASED ON I GUESS KNOCKED OVER TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY I GUESS MY REAL QUESTION IS THERE THAT NUMBER REPRESENTS- THE CHILDREN WHO ARE STILL OUTSTANDING WHO HAVE NOT BEEN REUNITED WITH THEIR- PARENTS- AND THEN WHAT METHOD ARE YOU USING. TO TRY TO REACH THE COMMUNITIES THAT MAY KNOW SOMETHING TO TRY TO REACH THOSE AND REUNITE THOSE CHILDREN WITH THOSE PARENTS IS THEIR COMMUNICATION IS GOING OUT OF SPANISH WHAT ARE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO TRY TO REALLY- YOU KNOW I'M FRIDAY MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. THOSE MOTHERS AND FATHERS NO IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE THERE SO WHAT KIND OF COMMUNICATIONS ARE IN FACT BEING USED TO TRY TO REACH OF THE PARENTS BECAUSE THE KIDS THE KIDS CAME WITH THE PARENTS THAT HAVE. TO BE THE PARENTS REACHING THE KIDS. YES SO I WILL I'LL TAKE THAT QUESTION- IN. IN EACH PART- SO IN OCTOBER THE FIVE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE NUMBER REFERS TO. THE OLDEST SEPARATIONS- ONLY AND THAT WAS THE NUMBER OF PARENTS THAT WE HAVE NOT REACHED AT THAT POINT- THE REASON WE USE SIX HUNDRED NOW IS BECAUSE THERE IS A SMALL GROUP. OF PARENTS WHO WERE DISCLOSED TO US LATE BUT ARE NOT AMONG THE OLDEST SEPARATIONS AND THAT IS A GROUP WHERE WE- ESSENTIALLY THERE IS NO REASON TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN. WHEN A FAMILY WAS DISCLOSED PURPOSE OF WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO FIND THEM SO- YOU KNOW AND AS WE TRY TO IMPROVE THE WAY REPORT OUT NUMBERS WE HAVE TRIED TO BASICALLY. TREATED AS THE MOST ACCURATE NUMBER THAT WE CAN GIVE TAT INCLUDES ALL CHILDREN ACROSS ANY POINT AT WHICH THEY WERE DISCLOSED TO US. HAVE WE FOUND THEIR PARENTS ARE NOT SO. THE FIVE FORTY FIVE IS INCLUDED WITHIN THE SIX HUNDRED NUMBER I CITED TO YOU. AND MOST IMPORTANT THERE IS. WE JUST DON'T KNOW UNTIL WE REACH THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STATUS THAT FAMILY IS AND WE HAVE TO- TRY TO GUARD AGAINST THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME WHICH WOULD BE THAT THEY ARE STILL SEPARATED- WORRIED AND POSSIBLY EVEN NOT IN CONTACT WHICH WOULD BE THE SORT OF NIGHTMARE SCENARIO. SO THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATES THE SEARCHES. I ON THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF- YES THERE ARE EFFORTS ON THE GROUND IN COMMUNITIES- IN CENTRAL AMERICA. PRIMARILY IN GUATEMALA WE'RE THE LARGEST SET OF. SEPARATED FAMILIES IS FROM- SO WE PARTNER WITH A GROUP CALLED JUSTICE IN MOTION THAT WORKS WITH A NETWORK OF- FREQUENTLY THERE EITHER HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES WHO WORKS TO. TRACK FOLKS DOWN- AND THAT. AS AS I THINK YOUR QUESTION RIGHTLY ANTICIPATES- SOMEONE GIVES AND IT. IS A PAINSTAKING PROCESS- IT IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT IN A PANDEMIC AND HAS BEEN FROZEN AT DIFFERENT POINTS DEPENDING ON- LOCAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND IT IS ALSO EXTREMELY DIFFICULT GIVEN THE HURRICANES THAT PASSED THROUGH THOSE COUNTRIES AT THIS TIME SO I THINK THAT THAT BEGINS TO EXPLAIN SOME OF JUST THE- SHEER DIFFICULTIES BUT- IT DOES LITERALLY INVOLVED GOING TO COMMUNITIES. SPEAKING TO ELDERS AND COMMUNITIES USING WHATEVER SNIPPETS OF INFORMATION. ARE AVAILABLE LOOKING AT BIRTH REGISTRIES- AND SO ON AND SO ON AND THAT HAS YIELDED. RESULTS IT IS. LED TO DOZENS AND DOZENS OF FAMILIES FOUND BUT IT IS UNDERSTANDABLY QUITE SLOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO HAVE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HELLO ASSEMBLY MEMBER AMBULANCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF MY QUESTION TODAY IS GOING TO BE FOR DR MATHEW LOW IF I CAN. ON PAGE FIVE OF OUR BACKGROUND PAPERS TODAY IT STATES THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES AT THE BORDER NOT ONLY FACE TRAUMA CAUSED BY DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR ATTACHMENT. TO CARING ADULTS BUT THEY ARE ALSO PROCESSING THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED THEM TO SEEK ASYLUM IN THE FIRST PLACE SUCH AS WAR AND VIOLENCE IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. I WAS IMPRESSED BY WHAT YOU SAID. AND REALLY WANTS TO ECHO IT IF I CAN. YOUR STATEMENTS FOR THAT THIS CAN LEAD TO LASTING PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM. BUT THAT THESE OUTCOMES ARE NOT YET DETERMINED. THAT YOU HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE RESILIENCY AND THE KIDS THAT YOU'VE SEEN. MY QUESTION FOR YOU TODAY DR MATT LAUER. IS THE EARLY DETECTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION IS KEY IN HELPING TO PREVENT AND REDUCE THE HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OR ACES. CAN WE PROVIDE A SCREENINGS TWO ONE DOCUMENT A CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE HEALTH. AND WELL BEING AND POTENTIALLY. PREVENTING THESE CHILDREN FROM DEVELOPING MENTAL ILLNESS SUCH AS ANXIETY DISORDERS DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL IDEATIONS. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE QUESTION FOR YOUR COMMENTS ON. AN ABSOLUTELY PART OF OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE KNOW THE STRESS AND TRAUMA IS CUMULATIVE SO IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST LOOKING AT ONE EXPERIENCE OF ADVERSITY OR TRAUMA AND ISOLATION JUST AND NEXT EXPERIENCE OF SEPARATION BUT TO LOOK AT THE PRODUCTS WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE MULTIPLE TRAUMAS ADVERSITIES THAT CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCED. WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN FAMILIES ARE FLEEING FROM VIOLENCE OR NATURAL DISASTER HAS BEEN MENTIONED RIGHT SO- WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ACCUMULATION. OF TRUNKS AND THE SPECIFIC. THE SPECIFICALLY. OF THE IMPACT OF SECTION WHICH AGAIN IS NOT JUST A ONE TIME THING BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG PROCESS FOR MANY MANY FAMILIES- HOW THAT INFORMS OUR EARTH X. THE DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY. OF CHILDREN- AND WHEN WE SAY THAT THE OUTCOME WAS NOT TO DETERMINE THIS BECAUSE- MANY OF THESE CHILDREN AND EVEN INTO ADULTHOOD THERE REMAIN OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEALING AND RECOVERY. AND FOR- AGAIN ALTERING THE PATH THAT. I'M INTRODUCTORY COURSE POSITIVE OUTCOMES. ARE ABLE TAKING THAT EARLY INTERVENTION IS KEY EARLIER THAT WE CAN. CATCH AND ADDRESS- ANY DIFFICULTIES IF PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING- WHAT'S TRIMIX BORDER CHALLENGE THE LITTLE REGRESSIONS APPEARS KIND OF GOING BACK TO EARLIER STAGES OF FUNCTIONING. BUT IF WE CAN PROVIDE SAFETY STABILITY. SKILL BUILDING- THEN THAT. HELPED SHAPE THE PATH TOWARDS RECOVERY IN TOWARDS HEALING. SO AGAIN. SO THERE ARE MANY WAYS VULNERABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY. TO WHAT HOW THERE VIRUS MORE SENSITIVE EVEN MORE SO I WOULD SAY THN IN ADULTS TO TRAUMAS AND- CITIES. AND AFFORDABILITY IS BASED ON HOW THAT EXPERIENCING TRAUMA ALTERS THAT THE LITTLE TRAJECTORY AT THE SAME TIME CHILDREN ARE VERY OPEN AND RECEPTIVE TO. POSITIVE INTERVENTION THE POSITIVE LIFE EXPERIENCES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SKILLS THAT HELP WITH EMOTION REGULATION OR HELP WITH YOUR HELP IN COPING WITH. DEPRESSION ANXIETY SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND SO THE EARLIER WE CAN INTERVENE. EARLIER OF THE COMPLEXITY INSTABILITY- AND- THERE WOULD STILL YOU KNOW TRY TO ASK BUILDING PRACTICE IN DEALING- THE MORE. AND OPTIMISTIC WE CAN BE ABOUT LONG TERM SO AGAIN WE STILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO- ADDRESS THE HARMS OF FAMILY SEPARATION. AND AGAIN THAT THE SOONER THAT WE MOBILIZE AND THE QUICKER WE CAN WE CAN CATCH FAMILIES AND IDENTIFY THE SKILLS ARE NEEDED INTERVIEW NOT WAIT THE BETTER OFF- YOU CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WILL BE. ALL THINK I'LL JUST END BY SAYING I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- REUNIFYING FAMILIES THIS THE FIRST STEP. BUT FOLLOWING UNIFICATION THERE IS- SIGNIFICANT. DIFFICULTY AND YOU JUST. AND THE CYCLONE HARM DO NOT RESOLVE JUST FOR GREENVILLE. SO WE ALSO NED TO BE THE- ABOUT LONGER- SERVICES AND INTERVENTIONS JUST AS YOU SEE SUGGESTED. MY FINAL QUESTION TODAY YOU'LL ALLOW ME MADAM IS. YOUR ENDING COMMON THE INITIAL WAS A DOCTOR MATT LAUER THAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP RESOURCE AND POLICIES THAT CAN HELP I WAS HOPING YOU CAN ELABORATE A LITTLE FURTHER AND- WE MAY NEED TO DO IT OFFLINE BUT WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO- SHARE MORE IF YOU COULD. YEAH I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY HAPPY SINCE IT IS A OF. FRESH LARGE CONVERSATIONS I WOULD HAPPEN TO CONTINUE THAT THAT OFFLINE I DO THINK THAT THAT'S ALSO A PART OF THE SLAVE FROM THE SUBSEQUENT AND ALSO I'M I'M LOOKING TOWARDS THOSE AS WELL AS- WILL KILL THE MORE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES- SH. BUT I WILL SAY BRIEFLY THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK THERE'S A NEED TO- ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARMS OF THE BEEN COMMITTED. A KNOWLEDGE THE IMPACT AGAIN THIS IS WHERE WE SEE HISTORIES OF. TRAUMA AND OPPRESSION REPEATING THEMSELVES BECAUSE- THE HISTORIES AND NARRATIVES ARE NOT FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE ARE NOT FULLY COMPLETE AND SO THERE'S SOME ROOM FIRST INITIAL PUBLIC PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE IMPACT OF THESE PRACTICES- IT ALSO IT REALLY BUILDING OUR OUR SYSTEMS OF CARE. ON THAT IS SPECIFICALLY GEARED AND- SENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS AND BACKGROUND OF CHILDREN FAMILIES AND SO- THIS INCLUDES TRAUMA INFORMED SERVICES TRAUMA FOCUSED THERAPY SERVICES- THERAPEUTIC SERVICES THAT FOCUS ON REBUILDING THAT SENSE OF THE ATTACHMENT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CHILD AND THE CAREGIVER. AND ALSO A SPOKESMAN MENTIONED IN THE OPENING REMARKS- ASSEMBLY WRAPAROUND SERVICES KNOWING THAT- THE NEEDS OF OUR CHILDREN FAMILIES AND THEN SEPARATED ARE COMPLEX. WELL THAT THEY HAVE LEGAL NEEDS THEY HOLD. HEALTH NEEDS TO HAVE MET THEY HAVE PSYCHOLOGICAL MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND REALLY THE MORE THAT WE CAN BE INTEGRATED AND WORKING ACROSS OUR DISCIPLINES IN COORDINATING OUR RESPONSE- THE MORE EFFECTIVE WE CAN BE AND SO THIS IS A COMMUNITY FOR WHICH- THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY- WRAPAROUND SERVICEABILITY. IS A PARTICULAR NEED AND- ONE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO YOU TO DEVOTE. RESOURCES TO THOSE TYPES OF SYSTEMS OF CARE. THANK YOU MATT LOW. DO WE HAVE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBER THAT PROTEST REMOTE THAT HAVE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I. AM SORRY IF I JUST MAKE A COMMENT I APPRECIATE DR RAM VILAS LINE OF QUESTIONING IN AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND EVEN THE LATEST MOVES. WITH THE- DIGITAL JUSTICE SYSTEM EMBRACING AND UNDERSTANDING. AND ON DOING THE EFFECT OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. BRING THOSE NOTIONS INTO OUR SYSTEM OF CARE AND YET HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM. THAT IS CREATING ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES THAT WILL BE LEFT FOR STATE AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO TRY AND UNDO IN THE FUTURE THAT THAT IS WHAT IS FOR ME ONE OF THE MOST FRUSTRATING. ALLEN'S OF THIS IS WHAT HAS BEEN CREATED AND YET YOU CALIFORNIA TRYING TO MOVE AHEAD AND BRINGING EXACTLY THAT KIND OF THERAPEUTIC APPROACH TO OUR SYSTEM OF CARE REALLY BEING ON DONE BY LARGER IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT'S HERE IT'S JUST VERY FRUSTRATING AND I KNOW TAX REVENUE THAT'S AT THE HEART OF. AND WHERE YOUR QUESTIONS LIVE. THANK YOU CHEST DOWN. YEAH I CAN ASK I MEAN. CALIFORNIA ALWAYS SEEMS THE LEAD AT ANY CRISIS THAT WE HAVE. YOU ALWAYS GET A LOT OF FOLKS I'M JUST NOT TALKING DEBORAH I'M CHUCK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE ALSO JUMPS IN HERE JUST IT IT SEEMS THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NOT NOT IN JUST GOVERNMENT'S GONNA ANSWER AND FIXES BUT ARE WE GETTING FOLKS FROM THE OUTSIDE TO GET THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY WANT TO JOIN IN AND HELP I MEAN HAVE WE GOTTEN A MASKING- PARTICIPANTS HAVE WE GOTTEN A POOR FOLKS DOCTORS PSYCHOLOGISTS- YEP COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS I MEAN. THAT ONE A PARTY AND HELP IT AND GET INVOLVED. BECAUSE I MEAN. IT SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES THE- THAT. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE WERE PROTECTING OUR OWN AND I AND I ALWAYS THEIR OWN I MEAN CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS A LEADER- ARE WE GETTING FOLKS NOW SAYING HEY WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE READY TO PARTICIPATE AND I'M ASKED THE QUESTION IS TO THE PARTICIPANTS I'M I'M LOOKING AT THE PRIVATE SECTOR SUPPORT PRIVATE SECTOR SAYING THEY WANT TO GET INVOLVED ALSO BECAUSE WE NEED EVERYONE. TO JOIN IT. IF YOUR QUESTION DIRECTED TO A CERTAIN PANELISTS ARE YEAH JUST SUMMER ONE SISTER WHO OVER WANTS TO. ENSURE THAT. HI I COULD PERHAPS OFFER A BIT OF A BIT OF AN ANSWER- IT. IT IS EXTREMELY COMMON AND AS BEEN TRUE THROUGHOUT THE TWO AND A HALF YEARS THAT I WORKED ON THIS CASE THAT. THERE IS A STEADY STREAM OF FOLKS. IN AND OUT OF THE BLUE EVEN SORT OF SAYING I DON'T EVEN KNOW. WHAT WAY I COULD HELP BUT IF YOU COULD THINK OF A WAY. PLEASE LET ME KNOW PLEASE PUT ME INTO EFFORTS PLEASE REFER ME TO VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS THAT- YOU KNOW HOW FUNCTION AS SORT OF A MUTUAL AID NETWORK FOR- SOME OF THE SEPARATED FAMILIES- AND SO ON AND SO- I THINK THAT. THE VERY SHORT ANSWER IS YES STEADILY REGULARLY. PEOPLE TO REACH OUT FROM FROM ALL AREAS TO WONDER HOW MIGHT HOW MIGHT THEY HELP AND IS THERE A WAY FOR US TO. TO PLUG THEM IN AND THERE USUALLY IS SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER THERE ARE- YOU KNOW FOR SOME OF THAT FOR EXAMPLE OUR REACH TO SEPARATED FAMILIES- THOSE TEND TO BE TO DELEGATE CONVERSATIONS THAT. CAN'T REALLY HAPPEN THROUGH SORT OF ALL INTERIOR EFFORTS NECESSARILY BUT- IN MANY OTHER WAYS- THAT THAT HELP HAS BEEN INVALUABLE. CHINA VERY. THE HEAD. YEAH THIS TIME IN TIME IN AN ECHO THAT RESPONSE AMERICAN TO GET IN MY WORKING ON DROWNED BY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND PEDIATRICIANS WHO ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT IN IN OUR ROLES IN THIS HARM TO CHILDREN FAMILIES AND THAT REALLY RUSHED TO THE TWO CALLS TO HER TO RESPOND SO I HAVE HOPE AND OPTIMISM I KNOW WHEN I FIRST GOT INVOLVED IN SOME OF THIS WORK WHEN THEY WERE COST BUT OUT FOR- FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO BE INVOLVED IN THE MONITORING AND IMPACT OF. OF SEPARATION PRACTICES- VISUAL SUPPORT CALL OUT WAS WAS INUNDATED WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE NUMBER SPONSONS THAT THEY RECEIVED- SO I THINK THERE'S PROMISING THERE'S HOPE THERE'S MOMENTUM FOR FOLKS TO TAKE TO GET INVOLVED UNLESS MR CLINTON MENTIONED SOMETIMES- IT IT'S ABOUT FINDING- THAT HAPPENED AND THE PATHWAYS. WORKS HARD PROBLEM AND- I THINK IN THE PAST WE'VE BEEN CHALLENGING WORKING WITH- YOU KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND FINING IN FIND WAYS TO ACCESS- THE KIDS AND FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED SO AGAIN THIS IS WHERE THERE'S PROMISE WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION- THAT ACCESS WILL BE MADE A LITTLE IS IT- IN A LITTLE BIT EASIER- AND- WILL BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW. CHANNEL SOME OF THE MOVEMENT AND PASSIONATE FOLKS ARE BRINGING TO THIS ISSUE- INTO. TAX WILL CHANGES SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY LIVE TO NOW MOVE ON TO OUR SIDE PANEL ON TO IMMIGRANT CHILDREN AND FAMILY- TWENTY THINK THANK THE FIRST PANEL FOR TESTIMONY- WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY- ON OUR NEXT PANEL OUR FIRST WITNESS IS NAY HAAS TO SIGN WITH THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR. YOUTH LAW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON AND STONE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON HUMAN SERVICES AND JUDICIARY THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PRESENT TODAY AT THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. ARE YOU ALL ABLE TO SEE THE POWER POINT THAT I HAVE UP. NOT YET- WE CAN FIFTH PART OF IT- THERE WE GO NOW WE CAN FIFTH. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT MY NAME IS NAY HAD TO SITE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOU BOB. ALSO KNOWN AS NICHOL. NICHOLS A CHILDREN'S RIGHTS ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO ADVANCE JUSTICE FOR CHILDREN YOUTH AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS INCLUDING HEALTH. EDUCATION CHILD WELFARE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND IMMIGRATION. OUR IMMIGRATION WORK SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT IMMIGRANT CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO LIVING COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN IN GOVERNMENT CUSTODY. AND THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO HEAL AND THRIVE. OUR WORK WEAVES TOGETHER MULTIPLE TOOLS INCLUDING LITIGATION POLICY NARRATIVE CHANGE AND STAKEHOLDER EDUCATION. NICHOLAS IS COUNCIL ON FLORIDA'S THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WHICH RESULTED IN THE LANDMARK SETTLEMENT IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN GOVERNING THE CUSTODY DETENTION AND RELEASE ALL CHILDREN IN FEDERAL IMMIGRATION CUSTODY. OUR WORK MONITORING THE SETTLEMENT ALONG WITH OUR WORK IN RELATED CASES WE HAVE FILES PROVIDE HAS PROVIDED US WITH TREMENDOUS INSIGHT. INTO THE EXPERIENCES OF CHILDREN AND FEDERAL IMMIGRATION CUSTODY AS WELL AS THE FAILURES OF THE CURRENT APPROACH. I WAS ASKED TODAY TO EXPLAIN THE TRAJECTORY. IN THE CUSTODY OF THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT. WHICH IS WHERE YOU'D SEPARATED FROM THE ADULTS WITH WHOM THEY ARRIVED WOULD BE PLACED. I WILL START WITH THE FLOW CHART ILLUSTRATING THE COMPLEX PATH THAT CHILDREN AND FEDERAL IMMIGRATION CUSTODY TATE AND THEN I WILL WALK THROUGH THE CASE STUDY OF A CHILD'S JOURNEY THROUGH THIS PROCESS. CHIEF THE FIRST STOP FOR ALL CHILDREN IN FEDERAL IMMIGRATION CUSTODY IS CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION. IT IS HERE THAT CHILDREN ARE CAGED ATTEMPTING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT AND THEY'RE FREEZING CELLS UNDER MYLAR BLANKETS WITH BLINDING LIGHTS LEFT ON ALL NIGHT. THESE FACILITIES WERE DESIGNED WITH ADULT MEN IN MIND AND ARE COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN AND FRANKLY FRANKLY HUMAN BEINGS. CHILDREN ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO BE TRANSFERRED OUT OF TPP CUSTODY WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS YET FAR TOO OFTEN YOUR KEPT WELL BEYOND THAT LIMIT. CHILDREN ARRIVING WITH PARENTS OR GUARDIANS ALSO KNOWN AS A COMPANY CHILDREN ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTODY OF IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT. CHILDREN DREAM TO BE UNACCOMPANIED MEANING THAT THEY'RE ARRIVING WITHOUT PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS OR PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO CARE FOR THEM TIME. ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE COPS OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT NOTICE- ARE ARE. ANY CHILD THAT IS SEPARATED FROM AN ADULT WITH WHOM THEY ARRIVE WHETHER THAT BE A PARENT. LEGAL GUARDIAN OR AN ADULT ANOTHER ADULTS IS TRANSFERRED TO OUR AS WELL. FROM OUR CHILDREN ARE ABSOLUTELY RELEASED TO A SPONSOR GENERALLY A FAMILY IN THE COMMUNITY I CAN CARE FOR THEM. SOME CHILDREN RETURN TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY. IN SOME CASES VOLUNTARILY IN OTHER CASES DUE TO APPROVAL ORDER FROM AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE AND OTHER CHILDREN AGE OUT OF ICE BECAUSE OF OUR CUSTODY I'M SORRY INTO ICE CUSTODY ONCE THEY TURN EIGHTEEN. THE CASE STUDY THAT I WANNA SHARE WITH YOU IS A COMPOSITE OF CLASS MEMBERS WE INTERVIEWED OVER THE YEARS. THIS STORY DOES NOT TRACK THE EXPERIENCE OF ONE SINGULAR YOU. MCPHAIL'S MOTHER WAS MURDERED BY HIS STEPFATHER WHEN HE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD. AFTER HER DEATH THE DAILY NEWS THE BILLINGS WENT TO LIVE WITH THEIR GRANDMOTHER WHO LIVED IN AN AREA. THAT WAS CHANGED CONTROLLED BY GANGS. WORRIED ABOUT THEIR SAFETY MENTALES GRANDMOTHER OFTEN KEPT MATTEO AND HIS SIBLINGS HOME FROM SCHOOL. GANG MEMBERS REPEATEDLY THREATENED DOWN HIS OLDER BROTHER WITH VIOLENCE IF THEY DID NOT JOIN THE GAME. WHEN THERE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD HIS STEPFATHER ESCAPE FROM PRISON AND THREATENED TO KILL HIM AND HIS SIBLINGS. AIRED FOR THEIR LIVES MATTEO HIS NINETEEN YEAR OLD BROTHER AND HIS SEVEN YEAR OLD SISTER FLED FROM. AFTER TRAVELING FOR WEEKS AND DANGEROUS CONDITIONS BUT THEY ON HIS SIBLINGS WERE APPREHENDED BY C. B. P. AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. CBP AGENTS SEPARATED MATT DAMON HIS LITTLE SISTER FROM THEIR OLDER BROTHER KEEPING THEM IN A DIFFERENT AREA OF THE HOLDING FACILITY. BUT THEY IS OLDER BROTHER WAS THEN TRANSFERRED TO AN ADULT I USED TO TENSION. IN LOUISIANA. WELL I'M A DAY ON HIS LITTLE SISTER WERE TRANSFERRED TO A SHELTER IN TEXAS THAT HOUSES OVER A HUNDRED THE COMPANY CHILDREN. SCARED MATTEO MEDICAL STORY ABOUT HURTING PEOPLE IN LOTUS. HE THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE THE SHELTER STAFF AND OTHER CHILDREN LEAVE HIM AND HIS LITTLE SISTER A LOAN. THE NEXT DAY STAFF WILL COME UP AT FOUR IN THE MORNING SHACKLETON AND PUT HIM ON A PLANE TO A JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER. IN CALIFORNIA. SATIN THOMAS DALE WHITE IS BEING MOVED WHERE HE WAS GOING NOR DID THEY ALLOW HIM A CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE TO HIS SISTER. WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF HIS ARRIVAL AT THE DETENTION CENTER BUT THEY- TOLD THE CASE MANAGER THAT HE HAD MADE UP THE STORY ABOUT PEOPLE HURTING HIM. I'M SORRY ABOUT HIM HURTING PEOPLE. THE CASE MANAGER RECOMMENDED THAT MCCABE BE MOVED TO A LESS RESTRICTIVE FACILITY. WANT TO STEP DOWN WAS APPROVED BY OUR OUR IT STILL TAKES A LOT MORE WEEKS BEFORE HE STEPPED DOWN TO A LESS RESTRICTIVE FACILITY. WHILE HE WAS IN DETENTION HE WORRY CONSTANTLY ABOUT HIS LITTLE SISTER. HE WAS TERRIFIED. YOU NEED TO SAY GOODBYE TO HER. HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE WAS IN A DETENTION CELL RATHER THAN BACK AT THE SHELTER WITH HER. HIS MENTAL HEALTH DETERIORATED RAPIDLY. AND DURING HIS TIME IN THE DETENTION CENTER GUARDS MOCKED HIM USING RACIAL EPITHETS. ONE NIGHT HE WAS PEPPER SPRAYED WHEN CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT BETWEEN THE GUARD AND ANOTHER USE. SH MEANWHILE MATTEO AREN'T NAY ANY SUBMITTED A SPONSORSHIP APPLICATION IN ORDER TO HAVE HIM RELEASED HER CARE. SEVERAL WEEKS LATER SHE WAS INFORMED THAT SHE WOULD NEED TO UNDERGO A HOME STUDY AND SUBMIT FINGERPRINTS AS WELL. WEEKS AFTER COMPLETING THE HOME STUDY BUT THERE'S CASE MANAGER CALL MANDY AND TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS DENYING. SPONSORSHIP APPLICATION. THOUGH THE CASE MANAGER DIDN'T PROVIDE ANYTHING IN WRITING SHE MENTIONS IN MIAMI THAT SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT MY AND HE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH SPACE TO ACCOMMODATE MATTEO SINCE SHE LIVED IN A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. SHE ALSO SCRAPPED EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT MALAYS ABILITY TO MEET MATHIAS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. DALY HAD NO WAY TO CHALLENGE THIS DECISION. AND SOME BAIL REMAINED IN CUSTODY. ARE ARE SHOULD BE A SAFE PASSAGE FOR CHILDREN ARRIVING AT OUR BORDERS RELEASING CAN'T AND IT'S CARE SWIFTLY WITHOUT INFLICTING HARM WHILE THEY'RE IN GOVERNMENT JUST EIGHTY. LATER THIS WEEK NICKEL WILL BE RELEASING A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONGRESS AND HOW TO ACHIEVE THIS. AND MORE BROADLY TO DEVELOP A NEW PATH FORWARD. ONE THAT IS BASED IN CHILD WELFARE PRINCIPLES AND PROTECT THE DIGNITY HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL MIGRANT CHILDREN. EVERY SHARE TIME TODAY MOREOVER FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE CHILDREN. ON TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU MR FIVE- WILL HOLD FOR QUESTIONS TO THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK IN OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS ERICA THE OTHER A DIRECTOR INTERPRETATION AND POLICY I'LL ORDER LEVEL. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING TODAY. I'LL START WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW ABOUT OTHER SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO IMMIGRANT FAMILIES I'LL TALK ABOUT OUR REUNIFICATION. ASIAN PROGRAM AND THAT TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE AN SERVING FAMILIES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN REUNIFIED AND SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORTING THESE FAMILIES. ARE JUST A START WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ORGANIZATION WE ARE BY NATIONAL LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDER WITH OFFICES IN LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO AND TIJUANA. OUR LOS ANGELES OFFICE BOTH LEGAL PROGRAMS. FOCUSED AND SERVICES FOR UNDOCUMENTED UNINSURED MIGRANTS AT THE L. A. COUNTY HOSPITAL AND WE ALSO REPRESENT MIGRANTS DETAINED AT THE ADELANTO DETENTION FACILITY. BACKGROUND SERVICES FOR REFUGEES RECENTLY RESETTLED AND COUNTING. IT SAN DIEGO WE REPRESENT MIGRANTS DETAINED AT THE O. TIENEN MASSA DETENTION FACILITY WITH A FOCUS ON THE LONG DETENTION. WE HAVE A LITIGATION PROGRAM THAT HAS EIGHT PENDING CLASS ACTION CASES ADDRESSING THE RIGHTS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS AT THE BORDER AND MIGRANTS IN DETENTION. OUR BY NATIONAL FAMILY UNITY PROGRAM FOCUSES ON FORMER CALIFORNIA. WHO WERE DEPORTED AND WHOSE CHILDREN ENDED UP IN CALIFORNIA COUNTY FOSTER CARE SYSTEMS. AND TIJUANA BASED MORTAR RIGHTS PROJECT PROVIDES KNOW YOUR RIGHTS EDUCATION REPRESENTATION HUMAN RIGHTS-MONITORING ACCOMPANIMENT TO ASYLUM SEEKERS AT THE CALIFORNIA BORDER SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE SERVED OVER TEN THOUSAND REFUGEES AND HOSTED OVER THREE THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS IN TIJUANA. TURNING TO OUR FAMILY REUNIFICATION PROGRAM IT STARTED ORGANICALLY BECAUSE WE ARE TWENTY SEVENTEEN STARTED DOCUMENTING AN UPTICK IN FAMILY SEPARATIONS AT THE SENATE FUTURE PORT OF ENTRY. SEPARATIONS WE DOCUMENTED WHERE THAT OF US CITIZEN CHILDREN- EIGHT SEPARATED FROM ASYLUM SEEKING PARENTS AND THESE ARE GENERALLY NOT THE TYPES OF SEPARATIONS BEING ADDRESSED BY THIS HEARING BUT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AT THE CALIFORNIA BORDER. THE MOST COMMON FACT SCENARIO WE WOULD SEE. AARON TO A PRE RELEASE PREVIOUSLY SPENT TIME IN THE UNITED STATES HOW DO YOU S. BORN CHILD AND WENT BACK TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY VOLUNTARILY. AFTER FACING PERSECUTION IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY THEY WOULD COME BACK TO THE BORDER AND PRESENT THEMSELVES AT A PORT OF ENTRY- TO SEEK PROTECTION BUT BECAUSE CBP CANNOT SEND U. S. CITIZEN CHILDREN TO ICE CUSTODY. THEY WOULD CALL SAN DIEGO COUNTY CHILD WELFARE SERVICES TO TAKE CUSTODY OF THE CHILD SO THAT THEY COULD DETAIN THE PARENT WE NOW KNOW THAT BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. SAN DIEGO CHILD WELFARE SERVICES TOOK CUSTODY OF ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN CHILDREN FROM C. B. P. ECKLEY FACILITATING FAMILY SEPARATION. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED SEPARATED FAMILIES WE ARE FOCUSED ON ENTITIES. BY THE END OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE SAW AN INCREASING NUMBER OF REFUGEE CHILDREN BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS APPS AND BETWEEN PORTS OF ENTRY AND THE NUMBERS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS ZERO TOLERANCE WAS IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE BORDER. BY THE TIME THE ACLU FILED MISS L. VERSUS ICE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE KNEW THAT AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED PARENTS HAD BEEN DEPORTED WITHOUT THEIR CHILDREN AFTER BEING SEPARATED. AND THEIR CHILDREN REMAINED IN THE UNITED STATES. HELLO THROAT LEVEL BEGAN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE MICELLE STEERING COMMITTEE TO ATTEMPT TO UNIFY THESE DEPORTED PARENTS WITH THEIR CHILDREN. THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT FORM PART OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE DIDN'T INITIAL SCREENING FOR THE PARENTS AND REFERRED TO A LOCAL LEVEL ANY PARENT WITH THE PROTECTION CONCERNS. BETWEEN AUGUST AND DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN HELLO CARRILLO STAFF SCREEN ABOUT A HUNDRED DEPORTED PARENTS AND TRAVEL TO CENTRAL AMERICA ON FIVE SEPARATE SEPARATE TRIPS TO CONDUCT IN PERSON INTERVIEWS. ULTIMATELY OUR ORGANIZATION SUBMITTED FORTY THREE PETITIONS FOR RETURN THROUGH THE ACLU IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AROUND THAT TIME THERE WAS A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THAT INDEFINITELY EXTENDED THE GOVERNMENT'S DEADLINE TO RESPOND LEAVING PARENTS DESPERATE FOR ANOTHER OPTION. SO IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND JANUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN A LOCAL OTHER WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN MEXICAN VISAS THAT ALLOW TWENTY NINE OF THE SEPARATED PARENTS AND THEIR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS TO LEGALLY TRAVEL THROUGH MEXICO. AND WE HELPED PRESENT THIS GROUP AT THE BORDER IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN. ALL WERE ADMITTED TO THE UNITED STATES AND OF SINCE REUNIFIED WITH THEIR CHILDREN. IT TOOK THE GOVERNMENT OVER A YEAR TO ADDRESS THE REST OF THE PETITIONS WE SUBMITTED THROUGH THE MISALLOCATION IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT PARENTS FROM% THAT GROUP. WERE ABLE TO REUNIFY WITH THEIR CHILDREN ONLY IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. ANDSOME MEMBERS OF THE ORIGINAL CLASS STILL REMAIN SEPARATED. AS DANIEL GLENDALE MENTIONED EARLIER IN TWENTY NINETEEN ACLU SUCCESSFULLY EXPANDED THE MICELLE CLASS TO INCLUDE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SO SINCE LAST YEAR TO ALLOW HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO IDENTIFY. THESE PARENTS AND SCREEN THEM TO SEE IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR UNIFICATION THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS. SO WE'RE CURRENTLY REPRESENTING A GROUP OF AROUND THIRTY PARENTS WERE DEPORTED WITHOUT CHILDREN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ALL OF WHOM WANT TO RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES TO REUNIFY WITH THEIR CHILDREN. MOST ARE IN HIDING AND HAVE SUFFERED THREATS AND PERSECUTON AFTER BEING DEPORTED FROM THE UNITED STATES. WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE BY DEMONSTRATION WILL PROVIDE DEPORTED PARENTS WITH THE POSSIBLE RETURN REUNIFICATION. THESE PARENTS- WHO WERE DEPORTED WITHOUT THEIR CHILDREN HAVE VERY FEW RIGHTS UNDER THE MICELLE SETTLEMENT. AND THE COURT HAS NEVER ESTABLISHED A CLEAR PROCESS FOR RETURNING REUNIFICATION. EVEN IF THE GOVERNMENT WERE TO STIPULATE FOR RELIEF FOR DEPORTED PARENTS THAT ARE CLASS MEMBERS AND THE MISSILE CASE. VERY FEW WOULD MEET THE STRICT CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE JUDGE. THIS MEANS THAT THE NEED FOR THE BITING MINISTRATION TO CREATE AN ACTUAL PATH FOR RETURNING REUNIFICATION. IS CRITICAL OF ANY OF THESE PARENTS ARE EVER GOING TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN AGAIN. THE COURT HAS ALSO LIMITED RELIEF TO THOSE PARENTS FOR THE VIABLE ASYLUM CLAIMS. EVEN THOUGH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS INTENTIONALLY LIMITED ASYLUM PROTECTIONS FOR CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS. OUR HOPE IS THAT THE BLIGHTED ADMINISTRATION WILL ALSO OFFER OFFER A FORM OF RELIEF INDEPENDENT FROM ASYLUM. AND NOT FORCES PARENTS TO GO THROUGH AN ADVERSARIAL COURT PROCEEDING TO GAIN STATUS IN THE UNITED STATES. CURRENTLY A LITTLE OTHER WAS WORKING WITH DOZENS OF FAMILIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REUNIFY ABOUT A QUARTER OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE SETTLED IN CALIFORNIA AND THE REST ARE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AS ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES MENTIONED EARLIER REUNIFICATION IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP THESE FAMILIES HAVE ENORMOUS NEEDS ACROSS ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIVES. STILL A LOTTERY LOTTO EMPLOYS A WRAPAROUND SERVICE MODEL WHICH MEANS THAT WE ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL COVERAGE. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOOD HOUSING PROBLEM THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE NEEDS. A WRAPAROUND SERVICE MODEL RELIES ON OUR COLLABORATION WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING BENEFITING ALL AGENCIES MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS LIKE SENECA. MEDICAL PROVIDERS LIKE OUR PARTNERS AT THE L. A. COUNTY HOSPITAL. AND CDSS FUNDED LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS IN AREAS NOT SERVED BY A LOT FOR A LOT OF. GETTING BENEFITS FOR UNIFIED FAMILIES CAN BE DIFFICULT. BECAUSE THEIR CASES ARE STILL PENDING IN IMMIGRATION COURT SO THEY DON'T HAVE LEGAL STATUS AND THEY CAN'T QUALIFY FOR MANY SERVICES. CHILDREN ARE IN A BETTER POSITION DUE TO THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL IN CALIFORNIA BUT PARENTS AND SPONSORS ARE OFTEN LEFT OUT. UNIFIED FAMILIES HAVE ALSO SUFFERED IMMENSELY DURING THE CALL THAT CRISIS. FORTUNATELY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RAISE FUNDS PRIVATELY TO ASSIST FAMILIES WITH EMERGENCY HOUSING AND FOOD ASSISTANCE. OTHERWISE AND MANY WOULD HAVE ENDED UP HOMELESS AND HUNGRY. TO BE THERE LOST THEIR JOBS OR AT OR OR ELEVATED RISK OF KOBE DUE TO THEIR CENTRAL WORK. CHILDREN STILL SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS ARE OFTEN LIVING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS WERE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME SUPPORTING THEM FINANCIALLY THROUGHOUT THIS CRISIS. MOVING FORWARD. STILL CALIFORNIA CAN HELP SUPPORT REUNIFY FAMILIES BY EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS TO INCLUDE PARTS WHAT BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN AS WELL AS SPONSORS CURRENTLY CARING FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE STILL SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS- I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE CDSS PROGRAMS- AVAILABLE. TO LEGAL AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WORKING WITH REUNIFIED FAMILIES BUT THEY DEFINITELY WILLNEED TO BE EXPANDED TO MEET MY NEEDS FIVE FAMILIES. THE STATE CAN ALSO WORK WITH COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BORDER COUNTIES OF SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL TO PROHIBIT AGENCIES FROM FACILITATING FAMILY SEPARATION RESULTING FROM INTERNAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT OR BORDER ENFORCEMENT. AND FINALLY THE STATE CAN INSURE THE ICE FOLLOWS CALIFORNIA LAWS THAT PROTECT THE PARENTAL RIGHTS OF INCARCERATED PARENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK.

FANECA WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND IS NOW ONE OF THE LARGEST NONPROFIT PROVIDERS OF CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ON THE WEST COAST.

IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THANK OFFERED EXPERT TESTIMONY IN THE MOST JP THE SESSIONS CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.

PROGRAM WAS BORN. STILL THE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN WORKING TO LOCATE FAMILIES IMPACTED BY THE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY AND LINK THEM TO RESOURCES. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS IN TRAUMA INFORMED CARE SINCE DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. DURING THIS TIME WE HAVE SPOKEN TO MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THIRTY STATES WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE. PROVIDERS NATIONALLY TO PROVIDE LOCAL REFERRALS TO FAMILY. CAMELINA ELIGIBLE FOR DELIVERY FOR ME ARE THOSE THAT WERE SEPARATED AT THE BORDER BY THE US GOVERNMENT ON OR AFTER JULY. FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND REMAIN IN THE US. THIS IS JUST ONE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT WAS HARMED BY THE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY WELL CRITICAL OUR SERVICES ARE LIMITED AND DON'T REACH EVERY IMPACTED FAMILY. THIS GROUP IS NOT A MONOLITH EACH FAMILY HAS A UNIQUE STORY UNIQUE STRENGTHS AND CHALLENGES. WITH THE FAMILIES DO HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY HAVE LEFT OF SEPARATION CHAOS IN HUMANE TREATMENT. AND ARE NOW NAVIGATING A LOT AND I KNOW IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS FOLLOWING DETAINMENT. I'D LIKE TO SHARE TODAY IS THE OVERARCHING LESSONS FROM PARTNERING WITH THIS POPULATION OVER THE LAST YEAR. IMPROPERLY FAMILY OUT WE APPROACH EACH COMMUNICATION pAUTOMATED. YEAH MORE THAN THAT THE LIBERTY TO MEDIA NEW STUDY OPPOSITE OF. RECORDS GETS ON THE PHONE IN THE FINAL CITY THROUGH FOR MEDIA. HI I'M JOE HUNTER PRESS. CALLING FOR OPENING THE MEDIA THE DO YOU LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE. AVAILABLE TO YOUR FAMILY. SOME PARENTS. ASK I'VE GOTTEN THERE PHONE NUMBER. OTHERS ASK IF ACCEPTING AND THEIR IF. CASES MANY ASKED ABOUT THE PUBLIC CHARGE OLD WERE IMMIGRANTS TO THE U. S. CAN BE DENIED PERMISSION TO STAY AT THE REQUIRED GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE OR LACK ECONOMICALLY SOURCES. I THINK THAT HELPED. IT IS OFTEN NOT EVEN OUR STATE TO ASK FAMILY IN THIS FIRST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE HORRIFIC TRAUMA THEY HAVE. RECENTLY ENTERED SO WE BOUGHT SHAFT CONNECTIONS P. FIFTIETH. FAMILY SICK RESOURCES FOR THE THINGS THAT ANY FAMILY ME. DIAPERS THREE INTERNET TAX OBLIGATES FOR DISTANCE LEARNING SCHOOL ENROLLMENT SUPPORT LEGAL SUPPORT. DR THANK YOU FOR THEIR KIDS MATCHES THE VETTING TELEPHONES. WE'VE BUILT A FOUNDATION BY REMAINING A RELIABLE RESOURCE THAT FAMILIES CAN COME AND THEY HAVE BASICALLY. FIFTY TAKES SO MUCH RESOURCEFULNESS AND CREATIVITY THEIR COMMUNITIES WHERE RESOURCES ARE SCARCE THAN OTHERS. WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF SUPPORT AVAILABLE. SERVICE PROVIDER ARE CON BUILD CONNECTION WITH LOCAL BASE OR- SO WE CAN MAKE ONE HAND. BUILDING THE FINISHED RELATIONSHIP IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE EVENTUALLY MANY FAMILIES WILL OPEN UP ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN DETENTION. AND EXPRESSED INTEREST IN RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. MONSON DIED SURE THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE HYPER VIGILANT AND FEARFUL OF A THIRTY THINK IT'S KATHLEEN HAVE RECURRING NIGHTMARES ARE DISPLAYING AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. I'M TURN ARE ANGRY AT THEIR PARENTS WERE LEADING THEM DON'T SPEAK VERY SUDDENLY SPEAK OR HAVE TROUBLE FOCUSING ON SCHOOLS. MAYBE THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE APPETITE OR INTERESTING EATING OR HAVE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS OF TRAUMA. THE MORE LETHARGIC OR HAVE SLOWED GROWTH IT TAKES A LOT FOR PARENTS TO TRUST US TO SHARE THIS IFORMATION. I BELIEVE WE AFTER IT AFTER DARK WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF THIS TYPE OF TRAUMA ON INFANTS AND CHILDREN. AND ADOLESCENTS. BASICALLY CONSISTENT WITH IF NOT LIMITED PORTRAYAL OF THE PHYSICAL MENTAL SYMPTOMS OF. THE CHILDREN IN CARE IN OUR PROGRAM. ONCE THE FAMILY. INTEREST WE WORK HARD. TAKE A THEM TO MY DAUGHTER IN THE- AND ABOUT FOR THEM I CALL THIS IS OF THE HOT HAND ON WE SUPPORT ACTIONS HAVE. PAYMENT INFORMATION SHARE WITH FAMILIES MAKE FACT DURING THE FIRST VISIT AND SOMETIMES WITH THEIR NEW PROVIDERS WITHOUT PART OF RECESSION. THE WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO THE POINT VEHICLES. RESOURCE AND PARTNER TO FAMILIES THEY WILL TELL US IN THE SERVICE IS WORKING. LIKE ANY PERSON GOING TO ANY TYPE OF THERAPY FAMILY THINGTO LIKE AND TRUST THEIR PERPETRATORS THAT THEY WILL RETURN. COLD TEAM HAS DEMANDED EVEN MORE CREATIVITY. AND ALLOWED US TO LEVERAGE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TELEHEALTH. SOME FAMILIES LIVING IN MORE REMOTE AREAS CAN ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES VIA THEIR OWN. WHERE CAN I THINK THAT THAT THIS WOULD OTHERWISE BE DIFFICULT. ANOTHER LESSON WE LEARNED AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR FAMILIES TO SEE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS THAT SHOW THEIR CULTURAL IDENTITIES OR DEEPLY FAMILIAR WITH THEIR IMMIGRATION MEREDITH. FAMILIES NEED SIX MINUTES PROVIDERS THAT CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO THE SIGNIFICANT DIVERSITY OF ATTITUDES TOWARD AND EXPERIENCES WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. MANY FAMILIES HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT THEIR CARRIED THE SEPARATION OR WHAT HAS HAPPENED SEND. IT WITH THOSE FAMILIES WE ARE PATIENT WE RESPECT THEIR TIME LINE AND FOLLOW THEIR LEAD. SO MUCH OF OUR WORK IS OUT REACH TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT OUR WARM LINE IN SERVICE LINKAGE CAPACITY. WE HAVE BEEN FRUITFUL HAD BEEN GOING DOOR TO DOOR IN CHIDING FACEBOOK MESSAGING. WORD OF MOUTH REFERRALS BY COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND LEADERS. FAMILIES WE ABOUT THE TALKING OTHER FAMILIES ABOUT THE SERVICES WE CAN OFFER. I CAN LEAVE YOU WITH A HIGH LEVEL THOUGHT THIS AFTERNOON IT WOULD BE THAT WE NEED TO KEEP SHOWING UP FOR THE FAMILIES. AND I THINK HE'S FAMILIES I REALLY MEAN OUR FAMILIES WERE IN THE SAME COMMUNITIES ARE IN THE SAME SCHOOLS WERE IN. LINE TOGETHER AT THE GROCERY STORE. AND ONCE YOU GET THE TEN O'CLOCK HOPEFULLY BE AT THE SAME COMMUNITY EVENT. THE HEALTHCARE THEY AREN'T HEALTHIER WE ALL ARE. THE WHAT ARE PRO IS NOW THE- WE NEED A SUSTAINED. CULTURALLY SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR THE FAMILIES. AS THEIR IMMIGRATION STORIES ARE STILL UNFOLDING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MY CEO CAN BEAR IT ALSO HERE AND HE IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LITIGATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATH NEVADA PUT S. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- I WOULD LIKE TO NOW OPEN IT UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE SIX ROBERT DRAWING MY FIRST QUESTION FROM IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE AC AC E. STUDY CONCLUDED BY THIS BY THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL- CDC AND KAISER FOUND THAT YOU WERE TALKS ABOUT THE TRAUMA THINGS OF THAT NATURE- THAT THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE GOING THROUGH MY FIRST QUESTION IS. HOW HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE LEGAL AND REMORSE AN EMOTIONAL CULTURAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES THROUGH LITIGATION. SO THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION MY SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE I KNOW WE THE NUMBER OF THESE CHILDREN THE BULK OF MY HAVE COME FROM CENTRAL AMERICAN AND OTHERS. HAVE OTHER CHILDREN WHO POSSIBLY WERE UNDOCUMENTED FROM OTHER COUNTRIES BEEN ALSO SWEPT UP- ALSO- ARE HAVING A HARD TIME REAP CONNECTING WITH THEIR FAMILIES. MISTER GIBSON SAID DIRECTED TO- SHAHADAH OR WHOEVER CAN ANSWER ANYBODY HAVE. ANYONE ON THE PANEL CAN ANSWER PLEASE. I COULDN'T SPEAK- AT LEAST JUST FOR A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS IN RESPONSE- IN TERMS OF. ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE FAMILIES THROUGH LITIGATION- LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SENECA MENTIONED THERE WAS A CASE THAT MANDATED THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- I KNOW THE SENATE HAS BEEN A BENEFICIARY OF THAT- THERE'S ALSO- OTHER CASES THAT WERE FILED KIND OF IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MASALA EDUCATION. THAT TALKED ABOUT- GIVING PARENTS AT LEAST KIND OF ANOTHER SHOT AT SOME OF THE IMMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE SO- MENTALLY AFFECTED BY THE SEPARATION WHEN THEY INITIALLY- WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE IMMIGRATION PROCESS SO PEOPLE HAVE HAD THEIR- WHAT'S CALLED CREDIBLE FEAR INTERVIEWS DENIED TO GET ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE SENSUALLY BECAUSE OF THE- MENTAL ANGUISH THAT SEPARATION HAD CAUSED- I CAN STATE AS TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FAMILIES FOR SEPARATED WERE FROM CENTRAL AMERICA CURRENTLY WE'RE WORKING WITH SEVERAL WHO ARE MEXICAN FAMILIES AS WELL- AND I KNOW THAT THE MAIN PLAINTIFF THE NAY PLAINTIFF AND MISS I'LL- WAS ACTUALLY FROM AFRICA SO THERE WERE FAMILIES THAT WERE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WERE SWEPT UP IN THE US BUT THE VAST MAJORITY- WHO WERE DEPORTED WITHOUT THEIR CHILDREN WERE FROM CENTRAL AMERICA. SOME FROM MEXICO- PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES GENERALLY WERE STILL IN DETENTION AT THE TIME THAT THE MICELLE COURT MANDATED REUNIFICATION SO WE'RE NOT SEEING THE SAME KIND OF ISSUES IN TERMS OF. NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND PARENTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH VENTURE FIVE MASS OF THE QUESTION YES- YOU MENTION NOT YOU PARTICULARLY THE LAST THE LAST VISITOR YOU MENTIONED THAT PARENTS WHO- WHO BANNED I'M SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN AND SPONSORS WHO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN DO NOT MEET ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR WRAPAROUND SERVICES TO UNIT UNIFIED. FAMILIES WHY IS THAT WHY IS THAT THAT THEY DON'T MEET THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. FOR RESOURCES. ONE IS TAT DIRECTLY TO ANY OF THE PANEL STRIP WHERE ONCE. THEY WERE HERE THEY CAN- RESPOND WITH ANY WITH ANY OF THE PANELISTS CAN RESPOND. I'M I'M HAPPY TO- I'M CAN DIRECT THE OF SENECA SO WHAT MOST WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW ARE GEARED SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUTH AND CHILD WELFARE AND LIMITED TO THAT POPULATION OBVIOUSLY. OF THE YOUTH- IN THESE PROGRAMS AREN'T IN CHILD WELFARE I ALSO WANTED TO ADD TO. WHAT THE LIMITS OF THE LITIGATION. OF THE BIT THAT- MARK ROSENBAUM OF PUBLIC COUNSEL FOR WE ARE VERY VERY NOW AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- LIMITS HAS VERY STEEPLY TO BILLS AND SOAK. UP SOME OF THE INTERVENTIONS THAT JOHANNA POINTED OUT ARE ONES THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO DO. IT ALSO REFERS TO A EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT PRIVATE SECTOR SUPPORT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING IN. SOME VERY LIMITED PRIVATE. SECTOR SUPPORT TO DO THINGS THAT ARE NOT WITH IN THE LITIGATION IT'S FAIRLY SILLY TO OFFER SOMEONE. WHO'S REALLY REALLY HUNGRY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOSE BASIC NEEDS FIRST. AND ONCE WE DO THAT AND DEVELOP A BASIS OF TRUST WE MOVED FORWARD TO MAKE MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER. TYPES OF SERVICES AND ERICA FOR THE STERLING OF THE LEGAL SERVICES ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE. CHEER ALL OF THE TIME BUT YOUR LEGAL STATUS YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO WORK TO MAKE YOUR FAMILY HOLE AFTER THE TRAUMA EXPERIENCE. SO WE'RE ABLE TO CREATE TEAMS TO PUT TO ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER AND RIGHT NOW THE LITIGATION ALONE DOESN'T ALLOW US TO DO THOSE THINGS. WE'VE ALSO BEEN FORTUNATE TO GET OUT ON MEDIA TO GET THE WORD OUT- USING CELEBRITIES- FACEBOOK ANNOUNCEMENTS AT CETERA BUT WE HAVEN'T. FULLY PENETRATED THE POPULATION BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T KNOWN UNTIL VERY RECENTLY ALL OF THE MEMBERS AND. THE CLASS WAS VERY LIMITED. THANK VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- AND BEFORE WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTION I JUST I APOLOGIZE I WANTED GO BACK TO- IS YOUR- OF JONATHAN A YOU HAVE A STORY TO SHARE WITH US REGARDING NELSON. THANK YOU I HAVE A TESTIMONY. AN HOUR WHATEVER CLASS MEMBERS REFER I FELT I READ IT HELLO MY NAME IS MELVIN A FEW YEARS AGO I LEFT MY COUNTRY OF EL SALVADOR TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES. I DID THIS TO SAVE MY LIFE AS I WAS RECEIVING DEATH THREATS IN MY COUNTRY THAT I WAS GOING TO BE KILLED I DECIDED TO SEEK ASYLUM IN THE US WITH MY SON WE CROSSED THE RIVER AND ARRIVED AT THE BORDER THEY WERE APPREHENDED BY IMMIGRATION AND I EXPLAIN TO THEM WHY WE WERE THERE. THEY ASKED ME FOR ALL THE DOCUMENTS I BROUGHT WITH ME AND FROM THERE THEY TOOK US TO TWO DIFFERENT ATTENTION CENTER MYSELF IN ONE AND MY SON IN ANOTHER WHEN I ASKED HIM THEM WHERE THEY WERE TAKING MY SON THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE HIM TO ANOTHER FAMILY SO THEY COULD ADOPT HIM. AFTER THAT MOMENT I DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MY SON FOR TOO MUCH WHEN MY SON AND I WERE REUNITED HE TOLD ME THAT HE CRIED EVERY DAY BECAUSE HE MISSED ME SO MUCH HE WROTE ME LETTERS EVERY DAY AND HE ASKED I THINK TENSION CENTER OFFICERS FOR ME EVERY DAY UNTIL HE FOUND ME AGAIN. H. YOU PICTURES OF. ME AND OUR FAMILY TOGETHER. IF ME GREATLY. AND I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW IT AFFECTED HIM AS A CHILD. EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO US ON OUR JOURNEY. HAS HAD A MAJOR EFFECT ON OUR MENTAL HEALTH. WE WERE SEPARATED AND I WAS WITH OTHER PARENTS WHO ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN. I TRIED TO BE STRONG FOR THEM. AND SUPPORT THE OTHER PARENT. BUT WHEN YOU START TO SEE OTHER PARENTS BEGIN TO WEAKEN AND BEGAN TO pWEAK AND SUFFER. MY HAIR STARTED TO FALL OUT FROM ALL THE STRESS AND I HAD SEVERE HEADACHES. THE SEPARATION AFFECTED MICE AND GREATLY. AT THE BEGINNING HE WOULD HAVE DREAMS THAT WE WEREN'T TOGETHER AND WOULD WAKE UP. THINKING HE HAD MANY NIGHTMARES. I DON'T WAKE UP FEELING SCARED. WHEN I RECEIVED A CALL FROM SENECA AND THAT'LL PUT ME COMING UP PROGRAM I WAS HAPPY. IT WAS A JOY FOR ME TO HEAR THAT THIS PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE. IT WAS VERY GOOD FOR ME AND FOR MY SON. WE'RE NOT RECEIVING LOTS OF HELP FROM A THERAPIST THAT HAS. HELPED MY FAMILY GREATLY I'VE NOTICED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN HIM. MY SON HAS TOLD ME THAT HIS THEIR PROCESS HELP THEM VERY MUCH. HE HAS LEARNED RELAXATION EXERCISES AND TECHNIQUES SO HE CAN REMIND HIMSELF. THAT WE'RE TOGETHER AND WE ARE SAFE. YOU FINALLY HAVING A LOT LESS NIGHTMARES. LITTLE BY LITTLE HE IS GETTING BETTER. THE SIMPSONS OF THE TRAUMA THAT HE XPERIENCED THAT NOW ARE MUCH LESS THAN THEY WERE BEFORE. MY DREAM JUST LIKE EVERY FATHER IS TO HELP MY CHILDREN GET AHEAD AND MOVE FORWARD. I WANT TO SEE MY CHILDREN SUCCEED. FROM OF A HOLD BACK. AND WAIT TO BE REUNITED. RIGHT NOW MY WIFE AND OTHER CHILDREN. ARE STILL IN MY HOME COUNTRY HEALTH WHAT ARE. BUT THREE FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA THIS TO REUNIFY OUR WHOLE FAMILIES BUT CANNOT RETURNS HER HOME COUNTRY'S AND SOME FAMILY MEMBERS CANNOT MAKE THE JOURNEY HERE. IN MY CASE WITH MY WIFE AND MY TWO OTHER CHILDREN THEY DID NOT COME WITH US BECAUSE MY WIFE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH TO MY YOUNGEST CHILD IT WAS VERY PAINFUL FOR MY WIFE WITH ON OFF OUT THE DOOR. TO WATCH THE NEWS AND SEE THAT CHILDREN ARE BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS AND BEING PLACED IN DETENTION CENTER. IT WASN'T UNTIL I WAS RELEASED FROM THE DETENTION CENTER BUT I REALIZED I WAS IN TEXAS AND MY PHONE WAS ALL THE WAY IN NEW YORK. I COULDN'T BELIEVE HE WAS ALL THE WAY OVER THERE THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM ME MY FAMILY SUFFERED VERY MUCH BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO US. THERE BEEN MANY CONSEQUENCES. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS TRAUMA. THERE ORGANIZATIONS CAL. LIKE FENNICA. THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD SUPPORT BECAUSE THEY'RE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE TRULY SUPPORTING SEPARATED FAMILIES. THE GOVERNMENT WOULD CONTINUE SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CANADA. AND THE BILL. I'M SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE HELPING ALL OF THE OTHER FAMILIES LIKE MINE. MY FAMILY IS VERY GRATEFUL FOR WELCOMING FAMILIA pSTERLING HELPED IN DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS AVAILABLE I HOPE THAT ANYONE. WHO HAS NOT RECEIVED HELP YET LISTEN TO MY WORDS AND ACCEPT THE HELP THEY ARE OFFERING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH- DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NO TRIVENI COMMITTEE MEMBERS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. OKAY THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- IF I CAN MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL ADDRESSING ONGOING NEEDS OF THESE FAMILIES- WE WILL BEGIN WITH HOLLY COOPER CO DIRECTOR OF THE UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF LAW'S IMMIGRATION LAW CLINIC WELCOME HOLLY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON STONE INVITATION IN THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING HERE TODAY I TRIED TO- ELIMINATE DUPLICATIVE TESTIMONY AFTER HEARING ALL OF OUR STUDENTS PANELISTS TODAY HOW MANY OF WHOM ARE CLOSE FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES- IN THIS. THE LAST FOUR YEARS- SO I WAS INVITED TODAY. TO DISCUSS THE NEED FOR INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES FOR IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WHO ARE. IN THE CUSTODY OF THE OPPOSITE THAT THE SETTLEMENTS- OFTENTIMES- IMMIGRANT CHILDREN SUFFER CONTINUING WITH TRAVELERS IS WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY FROM- IT'S BEEN YET- AS WELL AS FROM- JUST DECIDE. AND PART OF THOSE CONTINUING TRAUMAS. IS THE FAMILY SEPARATION. AND THAT OFTENTIMES THE SAYS THE NEED FOR APPROACH TO BE ADMINISTERED. MEDICATION WHAT I WILL FOCUS MY TESTIMONY ON TODAY IS THE LACK OF PROPER PROCEDURES TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS THAT- THE SECOND PROGRAMS ARE BEING ADMINISTERED WITH INFORMED UNDERSTANDING. FOR BOTH THE PARENTS THE CHILDREN AND THE FAMILY MEMBERS- WHO ARE ACTING AS GUARDIANS FOR CHILDREN. I ALSO- THAT WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR CLINICS WORK AND THEN AT THE END OF ALSO DETAILS SOME CONCRETE PROPOSALS I BELIEVE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD UNDERTAKE- TO ADDRESS THESE DEFICIENCIES WITHIN OUR- AS THE NEXT PANELS WILL DISCUSS MANY OF THESE OR FACILITIES ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ARE LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE- AN OBLIGATION AND AN ABILITY. TO RECTIFY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WILL DISCUSS THIS PANEL. FIRST OF ALL I CO DIRECTOR UC DAVIS IMMIGRATION HAWK CLINIC WHICH IS ALSO AN HONOR. AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACETS OF OUR COMMUNITY IS THAT WE ALL FEEL GAVE AN EXPERIENCE OF LEARNING FOR ALL STUDENTS. ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT A LOT. OF THAT WERE PRIMARILY INVOLVED BY STUDENTS OF COLOR OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE OFTEN FIRST OR SECOND GENERATION IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES INTO THESE ISSUES ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE HEART. AND OFTEN THEY ARE THE ONES WHENEVER YOU SEE MY NAME JUST REALLY UNDERSTAND OR MY WORK IT'S REALLY THE WORK OF THE STUDENTS- MANY OF WHOM WERE IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES- ARE THAT HAVE HELPED SUPPORT THE LITIGATION. AND ALL THE PROFILE OF OUR CLINICS WORK SO I REALLY WANTED TO TAKE MYSELF OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT I RECOGNIZE. THAT I'M ONLY HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE WORK OF THE STUDENTS. AND BECAUSE. ALSO THE TRUST OF OUR CLIENTS. THIS CALL. AND LAST YEARS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HE IN THE WORK SEVERAL. THAT MANY WHICH I'M- OF THE TEAM DINNER. WE JUST THE CASE LAST. THE CALL OF IN YOUTH. WHO ARE ALSO ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH WITH GAME. OF THE TRUMP. AND NOT WORRY IN LONG ISLAND ANY OF THEM AND BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA TO GO COUNTY JAIL- DURING THE TENURE OF THE REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS. WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SETTLED THE CASE. TO PROVIDE PROPER PROCEDURES FOR CHILDREN BEFORE THEY'RE ARRESTED OFF THE STREETS IT'S TAKEN FROM THEIR% FAMILIES AND FOUGHT ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TENSION REMOVAL. WELL WE ALL WORKS- WITH MISS TO SIGN OTHERS ON THE BECAUSE OUR LITIGATION. WHERE WE'RE SPEAKING TO IMPROVE PROCEDURES LIKE CONDITIONS FOR CHILDREN HELD IN FEDERAL CUSTODY. AS WELL AS I WORK FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS ON THE FOR A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WILL BE ABLE TO GET. BASIC MINIMUM STANDARDS OF CARE FOR CHILDREN IN FEDERAL CUSTODY. AS WELL AS BOND HEARINGS FOR CHILDREN. NOW FOCUS MY TESTIMONY ON THE LACK OF INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES FOR CHILDREN IN OUR CUSTODY. BUT I THINK LIKE MANY OF MY CO PANELIST IT'S ALSO NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND. THAT FAMILY SEPARATION IS BUT ONE OF A MULTITUDE OF TRAUMAS. OFTENTIMES JUST LEAVING THE HOME COUNTRY OR THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN FOR THE CHILD ON THIS PHONE IS A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. IN AND OF ITSELF. I THINK THE OFFICE LOSING A FAMILY SEPARATION IS BEING AT THE BORDERBUT OFTENTIMES FAMILY SEPARATION STARTS IN THE HOME COUNTRY. CHILDREN OFTEN MAKING THE HARD DECISION WITH PARENTS OR GUARDIANS OF SIBLINGS TO LEAVE THEIR COUNTRIES INTO MIGRATED HERE TO THIS COUNTRY A LOT. OF THE VAST MAJORITY OVER 80% THE KIDS IN FEDERAL CUSTODY LATEST VERSION. TO COME HERE AS AN UNACCOMPANIED MINOR. ALSO THERE IS THAT STEP. SO THERE'S THE PARTNERS. IS ALSO THE PROBLEM OF MIGRATION- OFTENTIMES A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS CALL MEXICO THE VERTICAL BORDER. THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES DURING THE TRAVERSE THROUGH THE COUNTRY OF MEXICO POPE JOHN OR EXPLOITED- WE'VE HEARD STORIES. BUT I WOULDN'T- EVEN TALK ABOUT IN FRONT O THIS ASSEMBLY BECAUSE EXPOSURE MATIC- THERE'S SO THERE'S THE EXPLOITATION PROMISE OF MIGRATION. AND THEN ONCE THEY MAKE IT TO THE UNITED STATES THEY'RE ARRESTED AND OFTENTIMES CAGE DISMISS DECIDED ELOQUENTLY- SPOKE OF THEIR OFTENTIMES PUT IN THE ORDER SHALL CAGES. I'M VERY INTIMATE CONDITIONS AS WELL AS A HORROR CUSTODY SO THERE'S WHAT WE CALL THE DETENTION TRAUMA ITSELF. THE TIME OF THE TRIAL ARRIVES OFFICER PRODUCE CUSTODY. THERE CAN OFTEN. YES I CAN. BREAKDOWN OF THE CHILD. WE HAVE TALK WITH LOCAL. A REPRESENTED WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE WHILE IN CUSTODY. WHERE WE HAD A CLIENT TO IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ATTEMPTED TO HANG HIMSELF IN THE BATHROOM. DUE TO THE ENORMOUS TRAUMA THAT HE HAD WITNESSED IN HIS HOME COUNTRY HOWEVER WHEN HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE PSYCHIATRIST WELL HE WA DIAGNOSED WITH OPPOSITIONAL DEFIANT DISORDER BECAUSE THE PSYCHOLOGIST NEVER MEETING COREY. INTO THE FACT THAT HE HAD JUST FLED AND WITNESSED HIS FAMILY BEING MASSACRED IN THIS WHOLE COUNTRY AND THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE CAN OF THE STATE FOR LICENSING ARM MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS LEGAL PROFESSIONALS CAN REQUIRE IS AN EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT OF THAT LICENSURE SO THAT WE NEVER HAVE A CHILD MISDIAGNOSIS. OR UNDER DIAGNOSED- FROM THE PRODUCT THE TRAUMAS THAT THEY'VE ENTERED BOTH IN THE MIGRATION AS WELL AS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES AS. WELL AS IN THIS COUNTRY SO- OFTENTIMES WILL A CHILD GIVEN LIKE. MEDICATION THAT THEY MAY NEED IT FOR WHAT WE WANT TO ENSURE. OF MY TESTIMONY TODAY IS THE WE MAKE SURE THAT THE RESIDENTS UNDERSTANDING OF THE USE OF THOSE THOSE MEDICATIONS ON CHILDREN. WHAT WE'VE SEEN OFTENTIMES THERE'S A STAFFERS DETENTION FACILITIES CONSENTING ON BEHALF OF THE PARENT. ANOTHER WORDS WE ARE RENDERING OFTENTIMES INVISIBLE THE LATINO FAMILY THE PARENT THE PARENTAL AGENCY THAT THEY HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE OVER THEIR CHILDREN. SOMETIMES WHEN PARENTS ARE NOT IN THE PICTURE BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROPER PROCEDURES AND PROTECTIONS IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN RESPECT. THE IDENTITY AND AGENCY OF A LATINO FAMILY NOT JUST A LATINO FAMILY BUT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THESE CHILDREN ARE INDIGENOUS. THANK YOU COMING TO THIS COUNTRY. INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE LANGUAGES ENCOURAGES CULTURES SO DON'T WANT TO REPEAT OUR OWN HISTORY AS A COUNTRY. OF RENDERING INVISIBLE. AGENCY OR FAMILIES OF COLOR WHO ARE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY OR. EVEN WHOEVER NEEDED TO THIS COUNTRY- WE ALSO NEED TO ASSESS THE USER PUBLIC. USED MULTIPLE. DRUGS ON. AT THE SAME TIME. WE ALSO MET WITH CHILDREN WITHIN OUR OWN WHO HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY HAVE THE- ONLY PEPPER SPRAYED BUT OFTENTIMES DUE TO PSYCHIATRIC HAVE BEEN FORCIBLY SEDATED. AND THIS IS WHERE THE STOCK FOR DETENTION FACILITY IS CONSENTING ON BEHALF OF THE CHILD FOR THIS THIS TREATMENT. THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS OR MEDICATIONS CAN NEVER BE GOOD FOR CHILD OFTEN THEY CAN BE VERY BENEFITS WHICH FILE. BUT WHAT WE ARE HERE TO SAY IS THAT CONSENT IS A VERY UNIQUE FOR IMMIGRANT CHILDREN. AS MANY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE TENDENCIES AND THE DETENTION ITSELF IS INHERENTLY COERCIVE. THE CHILDREN AS MR SITE ELOQUENTLY PUT IN HER CHART FORTEAN CONCURRENTLY IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS. SO WHEN YOU'RE TELLING A CHILD HE HAS THE ABILITY TO FOUR MAY HAVE THE ABILITY TO REFUSE MEDICATION. IT'S A DONE BY YOU KNOW TO A STAFFER WITH THE CHILD FEELS OCCURS INHERIT YOU KNOW CORSON BYRON MEANT THAT THEY MUST APPLY TO THE U. S. GOVERNMENT ASKING IT TO DO FOR FEAR OF DISRUPTING THEIR ASYLUM APPLICATION. TO THESE UNIQUE ASPECTS OF IMMIGRANT CHILDREN IN CUSTODY MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENTS DEVELOP- PROTOCOLS AND STANDARDS FOR HOW. TO ADMINISTER PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION. INFORMED IF IT CAN PROCEDURES BE SAFE MUST BE EFFECTIVE THEY MUST PROMOTE THE CHILD'S BEST INTEREST. AND THEY ALSO LOST- USED AS A MODEL WITH A CALIFORNIA'S ON FOSTER CARE PROCEDURES THAT IT'S IT THAT IT'S THAT IT'S STUDY IN DEPTH. AS WELL AS THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF. PEDIATRICS AND LOOKED AT THESE FOR INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES- DEVELOP POLICIES WITH CLARITY WHAT THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT WHERE THEY HAVE A DETENTION FACILITY. TO SHELTER CARE FACILITIES IN THE STATE. THE ASKED IS THAT THE COULD DEPRIVE COULD CENTER MUST BE IDENTIFIED AND WE MUST CONSIDER THE CHILD'S PARENTS. AS A POTENTIAL CONSIDERED TO NEED MEDICATION. OFTENTIMES IN HERE BECAUSE OF HER PARENTS OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY. IT IS TOO POOR TO AFFORD OF THE PHONE OFTENTIMES THEIR DAY BEST OF THIS DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY OVER THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND AT THE STATE WE CANNOT STAND BY THIS TYPE OF A PROTOCOL. SO WE MUST CONSIDER THEM AS IT WAS WITHIN THE AMBIT OF THE POWER AND TO DECIDE ON BEHALF OF THEIR OWN CHILD EVEN WHILE THEY'RE IN FEDERAL CUSTODY- MOREOVER- A CHILD MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THE FAMILY MUST HAVE AN INFORMED UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE DIRECTIONS ARE. WHAT THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE NOW WITH THE GOOD SORT OF WAITING THE GOOD AND THE BAD TO COME TO AN INFORMED UNDERSTANDING SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE CHOICES VERY TOUGH CHOICES. FOR THEIR CHILDREN OR WHERE THE PARENT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES- THE PROPRIOCEPTIVE. PERSON IS APPOINTED TO ASSIST THE CHILD. BUT IN CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS THE WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE CALIFORNIA CAN HELP BECAUSE OUR POLICY DOES REQUIRED STUDENTS. TO FOLLOW STATE LAW THE RIVER BELIEVE IT OR BECAUSE OF A- NEEDS THIS SORT OF CLARITY FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK IT'S TO HELP ORDERFELT POLICIES AND PRACTICES. AND GUIDELINES TO HOWTO SAFELY ADMINISTER PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS. FOR CHILDREN. THIRTEEN WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WE WOULD ALSO THE CAL. TO STORE CAME. FOR IT INFORMED CONSENT- MUCH OF LIKE WHAT IT ALREADY DOES IN IN THE STATE SYSTEM. WELL WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S THE ISSUE OF REFUSAL OF MEDICATION MANY OF THE CHILDREN WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE TOLD ME THAT WHEN THEY REFUSE MEDICATIONS ARE GIVEN A SPECIAL INCIDENT REPORT THE PROLONGS THEIR STAY IN CUSTODY. SO THEY FEEL THAT THEY CAN BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT FOR THEM TO REACH YOU REFUSE TO TAKE THE MEDICATION SO NOT ONLY SHOULD THERE BE INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES BUT THERE SHOULD BE AN UNDERTAKING TO DEVELOP PROPER PROTOCOLS FOR CHILD. NEEDED TO HAVE SOME AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD THESE MEDICATION WITHOUT PROLONGING HIS OR HER STAY IN CUSTODY OVERCROWDING TYPE OF INCIDENT REPORT THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THEM. FOR THEIR ASYLUM CASE. CALIFORNIA HAVE A ROLE ALSO KNOWN. OF IN WAY. I THINK THAT THING THAT THE BEEN OVERLOOKED HERE TODAY IS THE FOURTH. OF THE U. S. GENERAL'S WITHIN THE STATE- ARRESTING. FAMILY MEMBERS AND THEM OR OF FAMILY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT LAWYERS WORKING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR. LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH BLOOD STARTED OR TRAINING. UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE IN THE LONG TERM IMPACT. OF FAMILY SEPARATION. ON. ALL OF THE CASES THAT THEY ASSISTED. MOREOVER BECAUSE THIS HAS. THE EASTERN THE SHOOTER AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE. HAVE MENTIONED- WHICH IS SPEARHEADED BY THE SURGEON GENERAL. I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND FOLDING INTO THAT STUDY. ALSO PROPER PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS FOR CHILDREN FEDERAL CUSTODY WITHIN THE STATE- AND ALSO JUST PROPER TRAINING OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. AND DIAGNOSE THE NEWCOMERS IMMIGRANT CHILDREN THE DOOR NUMBER FOUR- LAWMAKERS IN HERE FOR THE COMPLETE SATISFACTION. VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MR FIVE GATE- OUR NEXT PRESENTER IS OR HOLE THOMAS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION POLICY CENTER. HI JUST MAKE SURE EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS COULD SEE ME. HOW. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU MISTER THOMAS. THANK YOU THANK YOU COMMITTEE CHAIRS MEMBERS AND STAFF FOR CONVENING THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TODAY ALSO THANK YOU TO THE OTHER PANELISTS FOR SUCH INSIGHT AND GREAT STORIES ABOUT THE NEED. FOR WHY WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH REUNIFICATION REPORT MY NAME IS ARGHA THOMAS AND I HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING AS THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS THE CALIFORNIA POLICY CENTER ORGANIZATION HAS SERVED CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT POPULATION FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND IS ONE OF THE LEADERS OF POLICIES THAT ADDRESS IMMIGRANT INCLUSION HEALTHEQUITY ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND ENDING THE STATE'S DETENTION TO DEPORTATION PIPELINE. I WILL BE SPEAKING MORE GENERALLY ABOUT THE ONGOING NEEDS OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES SPECIFICALLY A DOCUMENT CALIFORNIANS IN THIS TOUCHES ON HEALTHCARE ECONOMIC SECURITY AND ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES. COBIT NINETEEN SHOWN THAT DESPITE CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP. ON PROVIDING A SAFETY NET FOR IMMIGRANTS OF ALL STATUS LEVELS MORE CAN AND NEEDS TO BE DONE. CURRENTLY THE STATE PROVIDES MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS. ANY THE ELIGIBILITY AS THE YOUNG ADULT REACHES THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX. WE ARE WORKING WITH LEGISLATIVE CHAMPION SOME OF WHO ARE HERE TODAY. TO EXPAND MEDICARE COVERAGE TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. AND WHILE THE PANDEMIC A SHIP GOING THAT THE MOST AT RISK. UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED THE DATA ALSO SHOWS THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT POPULATION. ARE JUST POOR DISPROPORTIONATELY DYING AND CONTRACTING CO BID AT A HIGHER RATE THAN OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC POPULATIONS IN THE STATE. THIS YEAR THE STATE IS EXPANDING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT TO IMMIGRANT WORKERS WILL FILE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OR ITIN RATHER THAN A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. AS SEPARATE WILL HELP PROVIDE ECONOMIC SECURITY TO MEMBERS OF OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY BUT IT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT AS ONLY A START THIS EXPANSION CONTINUES TO EXCLUDE IMMIGRANTS. WORKING UNDER THE TABLE ROLES ENTERPRISES OR WHO ARE WORKING IN JOBS THAT DO NOT PROVIDE WAGES SUCH AS CARE GIVING TO FAMILY. CIBC'S HOPE IS THAT THIS BODY CONTINUES TO THINK YOUR POLICY. THAT CAN PROVIDE ECONOMIC SECURITY. FOR FOR THEM TO SEEK OUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORKFORCE. LASTLY AND PROBABLY MOST% RELEVANT TO THE CONVERSATION AROUND REUNIFICATION I WANT TO TOUCH UPON THE IMMIGRATION SERVICES PROGRAM THAT MYTH CAME IN WITH SPOKE OUT IN PANEL ONE. THE ONE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM HAD IS IT AS IT IS KNOWN TO ADVOCATES CURRENTLY PROVIDE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE BUDGET. FUNDING TO COMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THESE DOLLARS PROVIDE FUNDING FOR EDUCATION OUT OF REACH. LOW TO NO COST LEGAL SERVICES ON ISSUES SUCH AS DACA INITIAL APPLICATIONS AND RENEWALS. DEPORTATION DEFENSE AND MANY OTHER PROGRAMS. THE I. P. C. AND OTHER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS ARE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE CDSS WITH AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO BE SPREAD OUT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. AND THIS FUNDING WOULD ALLOW FOR THE STATE TO BE READY ENACT RAPIDLY IN RESPONSE TO POTENTIAL IMMIGRATION CHANGES. FROM THE BINDING MINISTRATION. THIS REQUEST IS BEING MADE AT THE BEHEST OF THE LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND WILL ALLOW THEM TO ADDRESS REAP REUNIFICATION EFFORTS. AND OTHER POTENTIAL CHANGES SUCH AS DOC EXTENSIONS AND A POTENTIAL PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR THOSE THAT ARE HERE. CIPC IS APPRECIATIVE OF TODAY'S CONVERSATION LOOKS FORWARD TO CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP. WITH MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES STAFF AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN EFFORTS TO ADDRESS FAMILY REUNIFICATION. AND THE LARGER CONDITIONS THAT MEET IMMIGRANTS COMING TO CALIFORNIA FOR OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER THOMAS- OUR NEXT. PANELIST IS WHEN TEACHERS LASKY CO FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IMMIGRANT DEFENDERS LAWCENTER. HI EVERYONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME THIS AFTERNOON- AS WAS SAID I AM THE CO FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRANT DEFENDERS LAWCENTER WE'RE ALSO KNOWN AS IN DEBT. AND WE ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST NONPROFIT DEPORTATION DEFENSE PROVIDERS IN THE STATE ANNUALLY WE SERVE MORE THAN SIXTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE FORCED TO FACE AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE ALONE APPROXIMATELY HALF OF OUR CLIENTS ARE CHILDREN WHO CAME TO THE U. S. UNACCOMPANIED. AND WERE DETAINED IN THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT SHELTER SYSTEM. WE ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES INCLUDING ONE ON ONE LEGAL CONSULTATIONS AND KNOW YOUR RIGHTS CLASSES TO APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN HUNDRED CHILDREN ANNUALLY. WERE DETAINED IN- OUR SHELTERS IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY AND INLAND EMPIRE REGION. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE LAUNCHED THE FAMILY UNITY PROJECT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE REPRESENTATION TO FAMILIES THAT WERE SEPARATED BY ZERO TOLERANCE. OUR PROJECT HAS WORK TO REUNITE FAMILIES PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT AND REPRESENT THEM IN THEIR ONGOING DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS. CURRENTLY WE REPRESENT MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FAMILIES THAT WERE FORMERLY SEPARATED BY ZERO TOLERANCE. WE LEARNED TOO MANY LESSONS FROM RESPONDING TO ZERO TOLERANCE TO DEMONSTRATE GAPS WE NEED TO FILL TO PROTECT THE SILENCE SEEKING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES GOING FORWARD. THE FIRST ASPECT OF THAT WHICH I'LL DISCUSS AND WHICH WAS TOUCHED ON BY MY COLLEAGUE MS COOPER. IN THIS IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE IN PROTECTING CHILDREN IN OUR STATE IS STRENGTHENING THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR- OUR OUR SHELTERS OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT WE AS A STATE ARE WELCOMING UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN TO CALIFORNIA WITH DIGNITY. IN MANY WAYS CALIFORNIA'S AHEAD OF THE CURVE WITH SOME OF OUR FACILITIES WHEN COMPARED TO FACILITIES AND OTHER STATES. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE IS NOT ROOM FOR SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. IT'S OUR SUGGESTION THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON THE STRONG FOUNDATION WE HAVE INTERNALLY IS TO LEAD THE WAY FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND CARING FOR UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN IN A WAY THAT CENTERS AND UP HOLDS THEIR DIGNITY AND HUMANITY. IN ORDER TO DO THIS CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENSURE THAT THEIR SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT OF ALL ASPECTS OF ALL OUR OUR FACILITIES IN THE STATE. I STRENGTHENING LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. X. ADJUSTERS INCLUDE. CREATING A CLEAR PREFERENCE FOR HOME BASED PROGRAMS SUCH AS- ARE OURS CURRENT TRANSITIONAL FOSTER CARE PROGRAM RATHER THAN THE CONGREGATE CARE SHELTER FACILITIES A TRUCK TRANSITIONAL FOSTER CARE PROGRAMS GIVES CHILDREN AND- OUR CUSTODY THE ABILITY TO LIVE WITH A FAMILY IN OUR COMMUNITY ATTEND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WELL AWAITING REUNIFICATION WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. FOR THOSE CHILDREN RICH THEY MUST BE DETAINED IN A CONGREGATE CARE FACILITY DUE TO CAPACITY OR OTHER ISSUES CALIFORNIA SHOULD LIMIT THE SIZE OF THOSE FACILITIES TO LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE CHILDREN AND IT SHOULD BE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED BUT THOSE SHELTER SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR SHORT STAYS. LICENSING SHOULD FURTHER BE UPDATED TO ENSURE THAT ONLY QUALIFIED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WITH A TRACK RECORD OF PROVIDING CULTURALLY COMPETENT SAFE CARE FOR CHILDREN ARE A TEAM ABLE TO OBTAIN NEW LICENCES VERSUS BUT STILL IT'S- IN THE STATE. IN THE ABSENCE OF THE STRONG COMMONSENSE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS CALIFORNIA COULD FIND ITSELF IN THE SITUATION WE DID IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT WAS CONSIDERING OPENING A FACILITY IN THE VAN NUYS AREA OF LOS ANGELES. THAT WOULD HAVE DETAINED MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED CHILDREN IN ONE FACILITY RUN BY A FOR PROFIT COMPANY WITH NO TRACK RECORD OF PROVIDING CARE FOR CHILDREN IN OUR STATE. STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN NOW TO ENSURE THAT THIS POSSIBILITY IS NEVER RACED AGAIN THANK YOU CHAIRED MINISTRATIONS. I ALSO WANT TO TOUCH ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING INDEPENDENT COMPETENT LEGAL REPRESENTATION AND CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITHIN THE STATE- I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR MY COLLEAGUE MISTER THOMAS FROM THE I. P. C. SPEAK ON. THE SPECIFICS OF ONE CALIFORNIA FUNDING AND I WANT TO. I REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING TO INVEST IN LEGAL SERVICES FOR FAMILIES SEEKING ASYLUM. NOT ONLY IS IT IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE FAMILIES WILL BE 11100% I'M NOT LOOKING AT ZERO THERE ACCIDENTALLY I MEAN 11100% MORE LIKELY TO SUCCESSFULLY OBTAIN PROTECTION IN OUR IMMIGRATION COURTS THAT THEY HAVE A LAWYER. BUT IT'S ALSO A KEY ENTRY POINT AND LINKING FAMILIES NEW TO CALIFORNIA TO COMMUNITY BASED RESOURCES FOR HOUSING MEDICAL CARE EDUCATION AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING MULTI YEAR FUNDING TO LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS GIVEN THAT DEPORTATION DEFENSE CASES ALWAYS REMAIN OPEN FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WELL IN MOST CASES THEY DO. APPLE OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY CASES THAT END UP OPENED AS PART OF OUR FAMILY UNITY PROJECT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE OF THOSE FAMILIES REMAIN IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS. AND REQUIRE ONGOING CASE MANAGEMENT AND REPRESENTATION. RECENT DATA FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SYRACUSE SHOWS THAT IMMIGRATION COURT CASES LAST ON AVERAGE FOUR AND A HALF YEARS BEFORE. MIGRANTS HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT. IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE FUNDING FOR NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES TO PROVIDE REPRESENTATION BE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CONTINUITY AND STABILITY THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE PROGRAMS THAT WILL ENRICH OUR COMMUNITIES FOR YEARS TO COME. THE LAST POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE UP IS AROUND ONE PORTENTS OF BROADLY DEFINING FAMILY SEPARATION TO INCLUDE SUPPORTING ALL FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA AND ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE BEEN VICTIMIZED. DUE TO THE COLD POLICIES THE LAST THE LAST FOUR YEARS. WE SHOULD NOT BE LIMITING OUR RESPONSE AND COMPASSION AS A STATE TO ONLY THOSE VICTIMIZED BY THE SPECIFIC POLICY OF ZERO TOLERANCE. ITS MOST PRESSING IN THIS MOMENT- CALIFORNIA FOR THE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WHO REMAIN TRAPPED AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER AS PART OF THE REMAIN IN MEXICO PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS MPP AND OTHER BORDER POLICIES. MANY FAMILIES OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO THIS DEADLY POLICY AND HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AS A RESULT. IN AS WE ACTUALLY SAW THE BY THE MINISTRATION BEGAN THE FIRST STEPS TO DISMANTLE THIS PROGRAM LAST WEEK WE ANTICIPATE THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WILL BE PASSING OR BORDER PORTS OF ENTRY AND MANY SETTLING HERE AT THE STATE. AND THAT'S AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS ALL OF BUT A LOT OF WAS ALSO- ON AN EARLIER PANEL TODAY. ARE PART OF THE NEWLY FORMED CALIFORNIA WELCOMING TASK FORCE THAT IS HELPING TO COORDINATE THE SIGNIFICANT HUMANITARIAN AND LEGAL RESPONSE THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO WELCOME THESE TRAUMATIZED FAMILIES INTO OUR STATE. THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATING IN THE INITIAL RESPONSE TO THE DISMANTLING. OF THE REMAIN IN MEXICO PROGRAM AND ALSO TO THOSE STATEWIDE WILL PROVIDE ONGOING LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. TO THESE FAMILIES IN THE LONG TERM. MY VERY LAST POINT IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT ALL IMMIGRATION DETENTION AND ICE PRISONS IN OUR STATE CAUSES FAMILY SEPARATION. THEREFORE WE IMPLORE LAWMAKERS TO SUPPORT STATEWIDE EFFORTS TO END IMMIGRATION DETENTION TO PROVIDE STRONG REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT OF FACILITIES FOR AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO EXIST IN OUR STATE. AND TO SUPPORT UNIVERSAL REPRESENTATION FOR ALL DETAINED IMMIGRANTS SO THEY CAN BE REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME TODAY. THANK YOU MAY. LUCKY THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MISS COOPER MISTER THOMAS MRS LASKY- I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. DO WE HAVE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY THAT WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION. OKAY. AT THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION OF OUR HEARING. ALMONDS ARE LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES OPERATOR ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- WHO WISH TO MAKE COMMON. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN ON THE PHONE LIKE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO ATG OPERATOR WILL GIVE YOUR LINE NUMBER SO YOU CAN MAKE YOUR COMMENT. PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND NOBODY IS QUEUING UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY FINANCE WE HAVE NOBODY IN THE QUEUE- TURMAN STONE- TO MAKE CLOSER REMARKS IF YOU HAVE ANY. OKAY THANK THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING HEARING I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN TRACKING OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. AND IT'S GOOD TO GET THIS INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO NEXT. ON THE TABLE AND FOR US TO CONSIDER. I THINK THAT THE MOST HELPFUL THING. IS THE CHANGE IN TONE COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW AND IF THEY WILL. TAKE A SERIOUS RUN AT ADDRESSING SOMEBODY IMMIGRATION ERROR ISSUES. I HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND I THINK THAT MAKES. OUR JOB. EASIER BUT IT IS DISHEARTENING TO SEE THE DESTRUCTION THAT STILL EXISTS. AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND FAMILIES WHO ARE. BEING REALLY TRAUMATIZED BY A GOVERNMENT SYSTEM THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA I THINK THAT WE ALL. EXPECT IN THIS DAY AND AGE SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME CLEAR INDICATIONS OF THINGS WE NEED TO BE DOING AND THERE STILL IS A LOT MORE TO BE DONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR RUNNING GREAT HERE. THANK YOU TERMS THE- I THANK YOU AGAIN TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS WHO SPOKE TODAY AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO JOINED US- THE FERRY'S BEEN VERY LIMITED I APPRECIATE OUR WITNESSES TAKING THE TIME TO SHARE THEIR EXPERTISE EXPERIENCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS AS CLEAR THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF FORCE FAMILY SEPARATION WILL HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON THESE FAMILIES AS WELL AS ON THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY CHOOSE TO SETTLE. WE'VE LEARNED TODAY THAT TRAUMA CAN HAVE LIFELONG ADVERSE EFFECTS IF LEFT UNTREATED IN CALIFORNIA MUST BE MINDFUL OF THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FAMILIES FACE WHEN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING SUPPORTS TO SERVE THEM I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT MORE CALIFORNIA CAN DO TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR IMMIGRANT POPULATION THANK YOU THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED.
