00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.082
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:32.217
ORGANICS BRAND SO YOU CAN SEE.

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:35.654
WE'VE DONE QUITE A BIT AROUND

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.122
COMPOSTING- THIS YEAR AND THE

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:39.024
PAST COUPLE OF YEARS I'M A

00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:40.793
COUPLE OF THE INNOVATIVE IDEAS

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:42.995
AROUND- ANAEROBIC DIGESTION AND

00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:44.630
THEN THE CITY OF STAND AS STUDY

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:46.932
VEIL IS THAT IS. BEING UP IN THE

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:48.934
AND USING THOSE TECHNOLOGIES I'M

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:50.302
WHICH I THINK WILL BE A REALLY

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:52.905
EXCELLENT COMPLEMENT TO WHAT WE-

00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:54.973
ARE SEEING BILLS ACROSS THE

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.109
STATE AROUND CO DIGESTION. SO

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:58.911
ALL OF THIS TOGETHER WILL GO

00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:01.113
WITH THE COMMUNITY COMPOST ACT

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.348
SB CAPACITY PLANS THAT WE SHOULD

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:04.850
BE SEEING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:07.085
MONTHS. TO HELP US REALLY DRY

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:09.221
OUT A MAP AND A LANDSCAPE OF

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:10.756
WHERE OUR RESOURCES ARE MOST

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:13.125
NEEDED- AND THEN HOPEFULLY NEXT

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:14.660
YEAR WE CAN HAVE A NUMBER NOTHER

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:16.261
CONVERSATION OF REALLY WHAT THAT

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:18.063
LANDSCAPE LOOKS LIKE. FOR THE

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.898
STATE OF CALIFORNIA I HAD TO

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:21.700
GIVE THE IS LEGISLATURE AN IDEA

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:26.271
OF HOW WE'RE DOING AND. AND

00:18:26.338 --> 00:18:27.105
WHERE WE'RE DOING OUR BEST WORK.

00:18:27.172 --> 00:18:29.241
I'M THESE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:30.576
OF OUR EDIBLE FOOD RECOVERY

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:32.478
GRANT PROGRAM I STAFF YOUR

00:18:32.544 --> 00:18:33.679

THAT I LOVE TALKING ABOUT THIS

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:36.715
PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU'RE A

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:37.583
RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENT

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:40.319
MAKES A HUGE IMPACT- OUT OF VERY

00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:42.788
VERY GRASSROOTS LEVEL SO THIS IS

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:44.857
THE ST FRANCIS CENTER IN LOS

00:18:44.923 --> 00:18:46.992

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.627

DOLLARS TO PURCHASE TWO

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:52.030
REFRIGERATED BOX TRUCK SO THIS

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:55.667
IS REALLY JUST INFRASTRUCTURE-

00:18:55.734 --> 00:19:00.672

SOME REALLY INCREDIBLE LOCAL JOB

00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:35.207

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:54.825
CLOSING DOWN FOR ANYWHERE FROM

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:57.861
ONE TO SIX MONTHS I'M SO AB AND

00:49:57.928 --> 00:50:03.200
PEOPLE- STAYING IN PLACE. AND SO

00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:05.502
WE DID ALLOW EIGHTEEN BILLION

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:08.505
RETURNS WHILE SEEING RECORD

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:13.176
SALES- AND THEN HEARING IN

00:50:13.243 --> 00:50:13.643
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS I

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:14.745
HIGHLIGHTED THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:18.715
PRESENTATION WE ARE BACK UP OVER

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:23.220
EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION-

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:25.322
CONTAINERS RECYCLED. I'M SO THAT

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:27.858
REALLY GOES TO ILLUSTRATE SORT

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:29.793
OF THIS FLUCTUATION THAT WE'RE

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:32.195
SEEING IN THIS PROGRAM- AND IF

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:34.331
YOU WANT A SENATOR I'M HAPPY TO

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:36.933
GO THROUGH SOME OF THE KEY

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.035
QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK- AND THE

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:42.339
LETTER THAT YOU SENT- BUT- I

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:45.375
THINK THAT THE- IT TO BE A

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:46.410
LITTLE CHEEKY THE HUNDRED

00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:48.345
MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS WHY

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:51.748
IS THE NUMBER. SO IS SUCH A HUGE

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:54.117
DISCREPANCY FROM WHAT WE THOUGHT

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:56.052
IT WAS GOING TO BE LAST JANUARY

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:58.054
AND THE ANSWER IS REALLY THE

00:50:58.121 --> 00:50:59.890
PROJECTIONS THAT WE BUILD INTO

00:50:59.956 --> 00:51:01.892
THE BUDGET OR THE SEMI ANNUAL

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:06.096
REPORT. OR OR ANY OF THE OTHER.

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:07.998
PLACES THAT WE WOULD PROJECT HOW

00:51:08.064 --> 00:51:11.735
THE THAT THE FUND IS GOING TO GO

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:13.003
WERE OFF. USUALLY IN A RECESSION

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:14.337
WHERE WE'VE SEEN HISTORICALLY

00:51:14.404 --> 00:51:16.440
DURING A RECESSION IS THAT

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:19.609
BEVERAGE CONTAINER- SALES GOES

00:51:19.676 --> 00:51:22.412
DOWN PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY- BUT

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:24.281
REDEMPTION EITHER IT STAYS

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:25.816
PRETTY LEVEL OR BUMPS UP A

00:51:25.882 --> 00:51:28.151
LITTLE BIT AND SO WE DID NOT

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:31.288
PROJECT- THE SALES THAT WE ENDED

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:33.156
UP SEEING IN TWENTY TWENTY AND

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:35.025
CONTINUE TO SEE IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:37.627
ONE. AS PART OF- THE REPORTS

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:39.095
THAT WE DID THAT REALLY

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:40.864
HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE THINK IS GOING

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:42.566
TO HAPPEN WITH THE FUNDS WE WENT

00:51:42.632 --> 00:51:44.801
THE MORE CONSERVATIVE ROUTE OF

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:47.137
PROJECTING. WHAT WOULD NORMALLY

00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:49.673
HAPPEN DURING A RECESSION- AND

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.408
AS YOU ALL KNOW THE SEMIANNUAL

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:54.478
REPORT IS REALLY AIMED AT MAKING

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:55.946
SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:51:56.012 --> 00:51:59.349
AWARE- WIN THIS FIGHT AND- IS

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:02.085
STARTING TO DECREASE- IS AWARE

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:04.054
WHEN- WE ARE PROJECTING A

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.323
PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION IN AND

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:08.425
THE FORMULAS FOR PAYMENTS. I'M

00:52:08.492 --> 00:52:10.360
RECTOR DIRECTOR LET ME I GUESS I

00:52:10.427 --> 00:52:12.596
MEAN WE ALL MADE MISTAKES IN

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:14.598
MARCH AND APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:52:14.664 --> 00:52:15.932
OF THE GOVERNOR OUR BUDGETS

00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:18.268
ANTICIPATED- REDUCTION WE'RE

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:20.136
GOING TO GO INTO A WRITTEN OTHER

00:52:20.203 --> 00:52:22.639
RECESSION AND THAT'S THAT'S FAIR

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:24.274
ENOUGH THAT THERE BUT BY THE

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:25.809
TIME WE GOT TO DECEMBER OF

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:27.644
TWENTY TWENTY. I MEAN I THINK

00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:33.283
ONE OF THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE. IS

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:34.451
WE PAY DISTRIBUTORS. TWENTY FOUR

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:36.887
MILLION A YEAR TO REAP TO K.

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:37.454
RECYCLE HOW MANY CANS AND

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:38.522
BOTTLES THEY'RE DELIVERING NOT

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:40.290
SUPPORT BEING RECYCLED BUT THAT

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:42.092
WAS THAT'S LIFE THAT HAPPENED

00:52:42.158 --> 00:52:44.761
APRIL MAY JUNE JULY ALL THREE

00:52:44.828 --> 00:52:46.396
TWENTY TWENTY. AND THEN YOU CAN

00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:48.398
THEN IT GOT CONTINUED IN IT IN

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:50.233
FEBRUARY MARCH AND APRIL AND MAY

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.536
BEFORE WE DID THE BUDGET. BEFORE

00:52:52.602 --> 00:52:54.371
DOES THE BUDGET SO DOESN'T MEAN

00:52:54.437 --> 00:52:56.606
WE'RE PAYING TWENTY FOUR MILLION

00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:58.842
DOLLARS FOR THAT DATA. IT IN

00:52:58.909 --> 00:53:00.176
LIFETIME LIFETIME IT'SNOT IT'S

00:53:00.243 --> 00:53:01.578
NOT YOU KNOW IT'S ACTUAL IT'S

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:03.179
NOT ESTIMATE IS NOT PROJECTION

00:53:03.246 --> 00:53:05.615
WE KNOW THAT IT IT'S AT THE

00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:07.984
STORE READY TO BE SOLD. SO WHEN

00:53:08.051 --> 00:53:11.288
WE TALK ABOUT- D. B. BEVERAGE

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:13.590
CONTAINER RECYCLING FIND AND

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.091
WHAT IS REPORTED IN THE BUDGET

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:18.128
AND NOT THAT OF FOUR HUNDRED

00:53:18.194 --> 00:53:21.331
AND- TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR

00:53:21.398 --> 00:53:24.701
NUMBER AS YOU OUTLINED IN- AND-

00:53:24.768 --> 00:53:27.504
AT YOUR LETTER. THAT NUMBER IS

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:29.673
PART OF THE JANUARY TEN BUDGET

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:31.474
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OBVIOUSLY

00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:35.412
AND I EITHER WAY. I THINK I DID

00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:36.880
A REALLY. MEDIOCRE I WAS GONNA

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:39.249
SAY BAD BUT I THINK I DID A

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:40.283
REALLY MEDIOCRE JOB EXPLAINING

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.119
THIS TO- THE CHRONICLE REPORTER

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:45.021
BECAUSE LIVING AND BREATHING THE

00:53:45.088 --> 00:53:47.457
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR SO MANY

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:49.759
YEARS. I REALLY I THINK

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:52.262
ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:54.297
THE WAY THAT OUR BUDGET WORKS IS

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:56.199
THAT THAT NUMBER IS THAT BUDGET

00:53:56.266 --> 00:54:00.937
FIND. OUT THAT FUNDS- NUMBER IS

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:03.573
FORMULA EIGHT FORMALIZED- FOR

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.308
THE JANUARY TEN BUDGET AND THEN

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:07.043
IT CARRIES OVER INTO THE BUDGET

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:10.981
YEAR AND IS WHITE- AS WHAT. YOU

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:13.750
ALL ARE WORKING OFF THAT SO WHEN

00:54:13.817 --> 00:54:15.518
WE TALK ABOUT THE PROJECTIONS IN

00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:18.955
SALES AND THE PROJECTIONS OF

00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:22.425
REDEMPTION- AND I THINK IT I

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:24.194
THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.862
WHAT I THAT ARE USEFUL WAS

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.564
COVERING IS THIS ABSOLUTE

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:31.801
ORIGINS. AND COMPARISON BETWEEN-

00:54:31.868 --> 00:54:33.570
THAT FUND STATEMENT THAT IN THE

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:35.705
BUDGET AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.507
THE SEMI ANNUAL REPORT THAT

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:40.310
REPORT IS NOT MEANT TO SHOW THE

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:42.145
HEALTH OF THE FUNDS. THAT REPORT

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:44.948
WAS CREATED VERY SPECIFICALLY

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:47.083
AFTER THE LAST TIME WE WENT INTO

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.918
PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION BY THE

00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:51.721
LEGISLATURE TO GET AWARENESS SO

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.189
TO PROVIDE ALL OF THESE

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:54.924
PROJECTIONS AND WHAT WE THINK IS

00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:56.593
GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE FIVE. I

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.829
HONESTLY AND BECAUSE NONE OF MY

00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:02.165
FRIENDS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF I

00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:02.766

IS HAPPENING ON A MONTH TO MONTH

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:17.947
BASIS OUT IN THE WORLD AND WHAT

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:19.215
IS ACTUALLY BEING RECYCLED

00:55:19.282 --> 00:55:21.184
SERVES YOUR PURPOSE IS SO MUCH

00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:23.520
BETTER THAN WHAT WE STATUTORILY

LAST TWO YEARS- CONTINUE- IN

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:55.645
TERMS OF SALES AND THAT'S WHAT

00:56:55.712 --> 00:56:56.613
WE'RE SEEING I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:56:56.679 --> 00:56:58.848
WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE THAT AS

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:01.184
THE WORLD IS NOW STARTING TO

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:02.986
OPEN UP- WHETHER WE WILL GO BACK

NOW I DON'T ANTICIPATE

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.503
EVERYTHING'S GOING INTO THE

GO. SO I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:33.583
IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT- THAT DAY

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:36.653

ON ONE MOMENT IN TIME- AND THEN

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.972
IT IS A DIFFERENT MOMENT OF TIME

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:44.374
THAT WE RELEASED THE BUDGET AND

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.575

YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THIS

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.913

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:03.232
DIMES ADD UP TO BILLION OVER A

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:04.600
BILLION DOLLARS WELL OVER A

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.936
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. I'M AND

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:08.437
WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:09.772
THAT WE'RE DOING IS PROVIDING

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:11.340
YOU THE INFORMATION YOU NEED SO

01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:12.575
THAT YOUCAN ADEQUATELY

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:14.944
APPROPRIATE THIS MONEY- THAT

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.679
KEEP THAT KEEP THE FIND HEALTHY

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:19.348
SO. AGAIN WE WILL COME BACK TO

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:21.550
YOU FOR MAY REVISE WITH UPDATED

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:26.022
INFORMATION- AND AS YOU KNOW I'M

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:26.789
ALWAYS HAPPY ALWAYS HAPPY TO

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:29.058
TALK ABOUT. THIS PROGRAM AND ANY

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:30.526
OF OUR OTHER LIKE I GUESS IN

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:37.533
JANUARY YOU CAME UP- OR THE GOOD. THE BUDGET SAYS THAT THAT

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.402
WE'RE GOING TO SEE. OUR A DEAF

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:41.537
OR WE'RE GOING TO BE TOWARDS A I

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:43.339
THINK A HUNDRED TO NINE THE I'M

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:44.273
I'M SHUFFLING MY PAPERS RIGHT

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.242
HERE HOW DO WE GET TO THAT

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:48.077
NUMBER. MAYBE THE FINANCE NUMBER

01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:49.178
IF IT'S NOT IF IT IS DIRECTOR

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:51.947
PLEASE. SO WE'RE NOT PROJECTING

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:53.649
A DEFICIT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.951
SURPLUS. WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:58.421
BASED ON. OUR PROJECTIONS OF THE

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:00.756
AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING OUT OF THE

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.925
FIND. VERSES THE AMOUNT OF

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:05.127
SIERRA COMING IN. IT IS THAT

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:06.962
THAT NUMBER IS BIGGER. BUT

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:09.532
BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES IN

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:11.233
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR THE CHANGES IN

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.170
THIS MARKET. OVER THE LAST. FIVE

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:15.938
YEARS OR SO WE'VE DEVELOPED A

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:17.873
SURPLUS AND IT REALLY DOES COME

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.608
DOWN TO YOU HOW MANY BOTTLES AND

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:21.344
CANS ARE BEING RECEIVED. AND I

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:23.412
USE THAT MONEY GETTING OUT THE

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:26.982
DOOR SO I DO THINK THAT THAT. BY

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:29.051
THE END OF THIS THAT THE NEXT

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:31.787
BUDGET YEAR AND WE WILL SEE THAT

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:33.723
SURPLUS GO DOWN BECAUSE WE ARE

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:35.658
SEEING THAT TREND AROUND

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:38.928
RECYCLING GO UP AGAIN- BUT- WE

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:41.230
ARE. AT YEAH I KNOW YOU DIDN'T

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:42.732
HEAR ME COME IN AT THE BEGINNING

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:45.301
OF THE YEAR AND- TELL YOU I'M

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:46.369
WORRIED ABOUT PROPORTIONAL

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:48.003
REDUCTION IN THE NEXT YEAR SO WE

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.638
ARE DEFINITELY NOT IN THE PLACE

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:51.674
WHERE WE THINK. THAT THERE WILL

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:54.210
BE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BECAUSE

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:56.512
THE SURPLUS HAS ACCUMULATED. SO

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.414
OKAY I'M LOOKING TO. RESTORE

01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:00.683
SOME FAITH AND FOLKS- YOU KNOW

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.385
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PILOT

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:04.820
PROGRAMS AND WE'RE GONNA GET TO

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:06.322
THAT IN A SECOND. BUT GENERALLY

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:08.224
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RECYCLING

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:09.725
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:11.260
TALKED ABOUT DESERT WE'VE TALKED

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:12.428
ABOUT THE UNDERSERVED WE'VE

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:13.763
TALKED ABOUT. WE'RE JUST

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:15.998
STARTING TO GET IT WHAT HAS

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:18.334
CHANGED WHAT WHAT CONSUMER

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:20.936
BEHAVIOR HAVE CHANGED IF. PEOPLE

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:22.037
ARE MAD ABOUT THE PANDEMIC%

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:24.407
DERMATOPHYTE IN PLACE. AT ABOUT

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:26.008
THIRTY EIGHT RUSSIANS INVADING

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:28.077
YOU KERN WHAT MAKES THEM. THANK

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:29.378
WHAT MAKES US THINK THAT NOW

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:31.247
THEY'RE GOING TO TRAVEL FIFTY

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.515
FIVE MILES TO RECYCLE THEIR

01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:35.084
BOTTLES I MEAN WHAT WHAT. WHAT

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:37.486
IS NEW INFORMATION. FOR FRONT OF

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:38.754
YOU THAT WOULD RESTORE THE

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:41.390
FAITH. IN THE PUBLIC AT LARGE

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:42.892
ARE YOU SEEING LESS PEOPLE DOING

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.794
CURBSIDE IS THERE ANY DATA

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.029
THAT'S COMING IN. THAT WOULD

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:53.369
INDICATE. THAT IT'S WORKING.

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:55.971
WELL I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW A

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:57.907
RISK RATE THAN IT DOWN TO

01:07:57.973 --> 01:08:00.776
ROUGHLY SIX EIGHT PERCENT. HI IN

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:01.710
TWENTY TWENTY BUT THAT WAS WITH

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:04.780
MANY OF OUR RECYCLING CENTERS-

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:06.182
CLOSED FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:08.384
REASONS. AND MANY PEOPLE AREN'T

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:10.219
NOT LEAVING THEIR HOMES WE WERE

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:13.756
STILL RECYCLING AND 68% AND

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:14.490
TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT JUMPED

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:17.226
BACK UP TO OVER 70% I THINK FOR

01:08:17.293 --> 01:08:18.994
FIGURING IT'S GOING TO BE AROUND

01:08:19.061 --> 01:08:21.197
SEVENTY POINT SIX PERCENT- AS WE

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:23.766
FINISH COMPILING THAT DATA FOR

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:25.167
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO WHAT WE

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.869
ARE SEEING IS PEOPLE ARE STILL

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:28.737
RECYCLING THAT THAT RECYCLING

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:31.340
RATE OVERALL IS IT IS PRETTY

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:34.477
AND- PRETTY STATIONARY THAT'S

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:36.412
NOT TO SAY THAT THAT THAT WE

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.580
SHOULD BE IMPROVING IT. I'M JUST

01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:40.216
SAYING 70% IS A PRETTY HIGH

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:42.551
RECYCLING RATE FOR ANY PROGRAM

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:45.955
MUCH LESS- AT ONE THAT IS-

01:08:46.021 --> 01:08:48.491
BRINGING IN. EIGHTEEN POINT

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:50.326
EIGHT BILLION BOTTLES AND CANS

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:52.127
LAST YEAR THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:54.263
NUMBER. I THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:57.066
BEFORE SO I THINK. WE'RE SEEING

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:59.134
THAT THAT THOSE REDEMPTION

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:02.438
OPPORTUNITIES- NEED TO IMPROVE

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:03.639
THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF OUR

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.674
STATE WHERE DOES THAT WHERE WE

01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:06.709
ARE NOT SEEING THAT RATE OF

01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:08.644
REDEMPTION. THAT YOU MAY

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:12.414
EXPERIENCE AND- AND OTHER PARTS

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.283
OF THE STATE THAT WE ARE SEEING

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.451
THE AMOUNT OF RECYCLING GOING

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:17.620
UP. I ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AS

01:09:17.686 --> 01:09:21.223
AS A POSITIVE- AS YOU KNOW THE-

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.192
REPLANTED PUBLISHERS HAD. A

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:26.095
MAJOR IMPACT ON RECYCLING AND

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:29.064
CONVENIENCE DON'T- AVAILABILITY

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:31.901
I FEW YEARS BACK- BUT JUST IN

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:35.571
THE LAST TWO YEARS- WE'VE I'M ON

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:38.474
A BROAD ONLINE. THIRTY MORE

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.109
RECYCLING CENTERS AND THAT'S

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:42.578
DURING THE PANDEMIC SO THERE IS

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:44.013
IMPROVEMENT AS IT IS HAPPENING

01:09:44.079 --> 01:09:47.249
BUT AS- AT AS AND YOU

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:53.422
HIGHLIGHTED SENATOR. AND WE TALK

01:09:53.489 --> 01:09:56.425
ABOUT FOR A LOT OF YEARS THERE

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:58.994
IS A LOT OF ROOM. A YEAH I GUESS

01:09:59.061 --> 01:09:59.595
SO WE HAVE THE LAW AUDIENCE.

01:09:59.662 --> 01:10:00.863
REPLAY CLOSE TWO HUNDRED AND

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.431
EIGHTY FOUR SITES IN TWENTY

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:04.600
NINETEEN N. N. N. N. SO WE HAD

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:08.203
ALMOST A FULL YEAR. OF NOT

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:10.873
HAVING RE PLANET- WHEN WERE YOU

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.908
GUYS ARE MAKING PROJECTIONS IN

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:13.809
TWENTY TWENTY RIGHT SO THAT SO

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:20.783
WE KNEW THAT- N. AS- OKAY.

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:23.252
ANOTHER I GUESS MY QUESTION IS

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:27.423
ON THE PILOT PROGRAMS WITH THE

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:28.958
SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE TALKED

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:31.193
ABOUT- THAT THE ARTICLE-

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.495
HIGHLIGHTED ON SOME OF THE

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:36.198
CHALLENGES OF WANTED THE PROGRAM

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:38.167
START WHEN DID THE MOBILE

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:39.969
PROGRAM START THERE'S DIFFERENT

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:42.237
COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM- THE

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:44.907
JULY FIRST ST WERE VERSUS THE

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:45.507
ACTUAL DATE WHEN THE MOBILE

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:48.377
PROGRAM- STARTED CAN YOU SHED

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:51.113
SOME LIGHT ON ON THAT BECAUSE

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.815
WHAT I AM WHERE I'M GOING FOR MY

01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:54.483
SECOND SHOULD SUPPLY THE FIRST

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:55.618
ONE I'M GOING IS THAT WE KNOW

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:58.287
THAT ALL THE OPTION BE PAYMENTS

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:02.524
STOPPED. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:03.659
REPLACEMENT ON THE RECYCLING.

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:06.829
WASN'T IN EFFECT. WELL AS YOU

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:09.698
KNOW SENATOR- THAT BUDGET PASSED

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:13.268
LAST YEAR SB ONE FIFTY FIVE-

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:15.804
CONTAINED A PROVISION THAT-

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:21.810
PROVIDED OUT FOR A YEAR- EIGHT

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:24.713
AND- AT HIATUS FROM PAYING

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.548
OPTION BE IF HE MET CERTAIN

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:29.118
SMALL RETAILER OF REQUIREMENTS

01:11:29.184 --> 01:11:30.719
IN THIS WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.788
TECHNOLOG MEN OF THE HARDSHIP OF

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:35.658
THE PANDEMIC HAS CREATED WAR

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:38.193
SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO. IT MOST

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.362
OPTION BE FOR THOSE SMALLER

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:43.198
RETAILERS THE SMALL BUSINESSES-

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:47.670
ARE NOT CURRENTLY I IN IN A FAX-

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.838
AS FOR THIS ONE YEAR PERIOD OF

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:52.074
TIME TO GIVE THEM TIME TO GET

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:55.577
BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE PRIOR TO

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:56.812
THE PANDEMIC I'M BUT YOU KNOW

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.747
SAN FRANCISCO IS AS A AS AS I

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:01.050
PUT IN MY RESPONSE SAN

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:01.917
FRANCISCO'S. PILOT PROJECT HAS

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.752
REDEEMED OVER TWENTY MILLION

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:06.055
CONTAINER SINCE IT BEGAN IN JULY

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.790
OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND I WILL

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:09.992
GO TO SAY THAT WE'VE AUTHORIZED

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:12.561
THESE PILOT PROJECTS EARLIER BUT

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:13.829
AGAIN MUCH LIKE STATE GOVERNMENT

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:15.030
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE REALLY

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:17.266
STRUGGLING DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:12:17.332 --> 01:12:18.834
ESPECIALLY THE EARLY PART OF

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:20.669
PANDEMIC TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:23.272
OPERATE REMOTELY AND I THINK WE

01:12:23.338 --> 01:12:25.074
CAN ALL SYMPATHIZE WITH THEM-

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.709
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE INSTEAD OF

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:28.110
THESE PILOT PROJECTS AND TAKING

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.312
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME- WITH THE

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:32.047
PILOT PROJECTS IT'S- A

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.549
PARTNERSHIP HAS TO BE BUILT

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:35.584
BETWEEN RECYCLERS- THE LOCAL

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:38.020
GOVERNMENT ENTITY- AND THE

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:40.155
PLACES THAT ARE GOING TO BE. AT

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:42.725
A CITING THE DROP OFF OR R. OR

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:45.994
PICK UP- OPPORTUNITIES AND SO IT

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:47.496
TAKES A LITTLE TIME TO FILL

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:48.597
THESE OUT BUT SAN FRANCISCO SO

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:52.067
FAR HAS- SENDS JULY TWENTY

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.702
TWENTY ONE RECYCLED MORE THAN

01:12:53.769 --> 01:12:56.638
TWENTY MILLION CONTAINERS- AND

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:58.841
THEY ARE DOING AN INTERESTING I

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:00.409
THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO LOOK

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:01.643
AT THEIR PILOT PROJECT BECAUSE

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:03.011
THEY'RE TESTING A NUMBER OF

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:04.913
DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.049
SO MOBILE RECYCLING WILL BE ONE

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.851
OF THEM AS THEY'RE GETTING NOT

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:34.877

MUCH MORE ELOQUENTLY TO THE

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:54.129
SPECIFIC CHALLENGES THAT. I HAVE

01:13:54.196 --> 01:13:55.931

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:17.719
WHEN I WAS STILL IN THE

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:18.720

STATUTE IS INCREDIBLY

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:48.477
PERSPECTIVE ON HOW WE- AT WHAT

01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:50.045
WE COLLECT AND WHAT WE COLLECT

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:52.581
ON AND HOW WE GET PAYMENTS AND

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:53.849
ON WHAT SCHEDULE WE GET

LEGISLATURE. AS I LOOK AT THE

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:43.852
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL SOME

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:45.120
OF THE DIFFERENCE SEEMS TO BE

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:46.822
EVAPORATING WHERE HE JUST

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:49.191
DECIDES I WANT TO DO IT THIS WAY

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:51.093
BUT UNLESS IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:51.793
HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.196
AND IT'S ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:54.830
DIFFERENCE TOWARDS THEM SO- WE

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:57.265
CAN LIVE WITH THAT I DIDN'T WANT

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:58.333
TO ASK I NEVER HEARD FROM

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.335
FINANCE WHAT WAS THE MINIMUM OF

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.070
THE RESERVE THAT THEY THOUGHT

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:03.772
THAT SHOULD BE IN THE ACCOUNT. I

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:07.042
MISSED OUT ON THAT. YES SIR

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.510
GENERAL PART OF FINANCE WE DON'T

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.545
ACTUALLY HAVE A SPECIFIC

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:12.714
MINIMUM- YOU KNOW IT IT IT

01:19:12.781 --> 01:19:14.249
REALLY DEPENDS ON THE PLANET

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:15.684
I'LL GO I'LL JUST SAY THAT WE'RE

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:16.585
DEFINITELY STILL KIND OF

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.854
MONITORING THE HEALTH CONDITION

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.556
OF FUND AND- LOOKING TO BE KIND

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:22.491
OF WHAT THE TRENDS ARE GOING TO

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:24.726
BE MOVING. THAT NOT THEY AT ME

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:27.796
VISION THERE'S NO YEAH NUMBER

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:29.798
THAT PER SE THAT WERE SAYING

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:32.734
SHOULD BE THE MINIMUM OF THE DAY

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:34.669
SO FINANCES AWARE WE TALK THIS

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:35.904
FUND SOME LIKE IF DID IF YOU

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:38.373
JUST LANDED FROM OUTER SPACE IT

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.509
SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS A GREAT THING

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:41.877
SURPLUS FUND THESE ARE DEPOSITS

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:44.112
THAT CONSUMERS HAVE PAID THAT

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:44.846
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:47.349
REDEEM. THEY THEY PAID THEIR

NICHOLSON PAID THEIR TIME IN THE

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:51.786
SYSTEM IS SO BROKEN BUT THEY

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:53.788
HAVE NO PLACE TO GO NOW SOME

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:56.091
PEOPLE FOR CONVENIENCE WOULD DO

I REPEAT EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:02.063
TALKING ABOUT INFLATION AND

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.032
PROBLEMS WITH DISADVANTAGED

MONTH AND DEPOSITS THAT THEY

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:10.539

THEY CAN'T GO TO THE STORE THEY

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.009

IS THE CONSUMERS MONEY THAT

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.818
WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING OF IN AN

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:25.754
APPROPRIATE WAY I GUESS BECAUSE

OF EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO TRY TO

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.362
GET THERE. I TEND TO THINK OF

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:36.297
THEM AS PART OF A ROAD MAP

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:37.932
INJECTION THREE BIG BUCKETS. AND

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:39.400
ONE IS A SERIES OF STATEWIDE

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:41.135
STRATEGIES FOR THINGS LIKE

01:25:41.202 --> 01:25:43.771
REFORESTATION PRESCRIBED FIRE

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.440
WOULD YOU LOSE ASIAN PRIVATE

SURE. AGENCIES ARE COORDINATING

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:50.512
AND MOVING FORWARD IN EACH OF

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:52.847
THOSE AREAS. SECOND A

01:25:52.914 --> 01:25:54.949
COMPREHENSIVE TRACKING SYSTEM.

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:56.684
SO THAT YOU AND OTHERS CAN BE

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:58.052
AWARE OF WHAT WE'RE

01:25:58.119 --> 01:26:00.154
ACCOMPLISHING ON THE GROUND. AS

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:01.356
YOU PROBABLY KNOW ALL THE

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:02.824
AGENCIES ACCOUNT THINGS LIKE

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:04.592
ACRES TREATED VERY DIFFERENTLY.

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:05.760
WE'RE TRYING TO ALLOW ACT COME

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:08.129
UP WITH ONE CONSISTENT SYSTEM.

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:09.664
AND ALSO GO BEYOND ACRES TREES

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:11.366
AND BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:13.234

KNOW EFFECTIVENESS AT CETERA.

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:22.877
AND THEN FINALLY AND I THINK-

01:26:22.944 --> 01:26:23.878
OKAY PERHAPS MOST IN THE

01:26:23.945 --> 01:26:25.280

01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:36.824
UNDERSTAND THAT. WE ARE PUTTING

01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:38.960
TOGETHER A FIVE POINT STRATEGY

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.528
TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THAT WE'VE

01:26:40.595 --> 01:26:42.230
GOT A SERIES OF REGIONAL FORUMS

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:43.865
WERE MEETING REGULARLY WITH THE

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:45.800
LEADERS IN EACH REGION. TO

SO THAT WE CAN. HELP THEM

01:26:49.637 --> 01:26:51.839
ADDRESS THEM SECOND A SET OF

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:53.841
REGIONAL PROFILES ARE SCIENCE

01:26:53.908 --> 01:26:56.678
DRIVEN. THAT RECOGNIZE WITH THE

01:26:56.744 --> 01:26:59.647

BUT THE LEGISLATURE. CODIFIED

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:11.059
LAST YEAR TO BUILD A PIPELINE OF

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:12.594
REGIONAL PROJECTS THAT REFLECT

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.129
AGAIN THE PRIORITIES AND RISK IN

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:18.099
EACH REGION AND TO FUND THOSE

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.601
THROUGH A NEW CONCEPT THAT WE'RE

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:21.502
STARTING TO PILE IT WHICH IS

01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:23.471
REGIONAL BLOCK GRANTS TO BE ABLE

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:25.006

PRIORITIZE AND GET PROJECTS

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:47.729
DONE. OF COURSE DOING ALL THAT

01:27:47.795 --> 01:27:49.831
DOES TAKE RESOURCES ARE WE ARE

01:27:49.897 --> 01:27:51.833

ABOUT OUR STRATEGY I KNOW WE

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:46.848

CODIFYING THE ACTION PLAN- I HAD

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:05.566

HARDENING- IN DEFENSIBLE SPACE

01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:16.711
PRONG OF THE STRATEGY- AND I'M

01:30:16.778 --> 01:30:19.080
JUST WONDERING I KNOW THERE WAS

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:20.782
SOME RESISTANCE TO PUTTING

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:23.518
ANYTHING QUANTIFIABLE THAT WOULD

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:25.953
BE SOME KIND OF ANALOG TO. THE

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:31.125
A CENTRAL METRIC AND YOU KNOW I

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:31.793

DEFENSIBLE SPACE WORKING. SEEMS

01:30:39.066 --> 01:30:40.535
LIKE THE BUDGET KIND OF REFLECTS

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:45.673
THAT- THAT PRIORITY IN IN THE-

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.308
CURRENT ATTENTION BEING GIVEN

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:50.077
TO- THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS BUT

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:51.712
I'M I'M WONDERING IN LIGHT OF

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:53.681
THE FACT THAT- APARTMENT

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:55.683
INSURANCE APPARENTLY HAS. A NEW

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:56.984
PROPOSAL THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:59.487

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:09.697
TO. TO HELP DRIVE- THAT PRONG OF

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:12.333
THE STRATEGY. YES WE DO WE HAVE

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.367
AN EFFORT UNDERWAY WE'VE GOT A

01:31:13.434 --> 01:31:15.303
FIRE ADAPTED COMMUNITIES WORK

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:17.104

GROUPS TO TRY TO GET A BETTER

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:26.380
HANDLE ON. HOW DO YOU EVALUATE

01:31:26.447 --> 01:31:28.216
COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY WHAT'S

01:31:28.282 --> 01:31:31.152
WORKING AND NOT WORKING AND WHAT

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:34.088

OF- RESIDENCES AND BUSINESSES

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:44.465
THAT HAVE HOME HARDENING THAT

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:46.434
HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE DO THEY

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.803
HAVE EVACUATION ROUTES. DO THEY

01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:50.738
HAVE OUT OF REACH- THERE'S A

01:31:50.805 --> 01:31:52.807
WIDE VARIETY OF RAZORS OUT THERE

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:55.176
ON THE DATE MOST OF THE FOCUS

01:31:55.243 --> 01:31:56.711
HAS BEEN ON GETTING THOSE

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:59.447
INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS OF THESE

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:01.515
PROGRAMMES UNDERWAY- BUT I'D BE

01:32:01.582 --> 01:32:03.517
THE FIRST TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO

01:32:03.584 --> 01:32:05.586
DO A BETTER JOB. OF TRYING TO

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:07.722
THEN ROLL THOSE UP AND BE ABLE

01:32:07.788 --> 01:32:09.824
TO TELL YOU AND OTHERS HOW MUCH

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:11.626
PROGRESS ARE WE MAKING IN MAKING

01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:13.995
COMMUNITIES RESILIENCE IT'S A

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:15.596
REAL CHALLENGE IN COMING UP WITH

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:17.832
A SINGLE DEFINITION OF WHAT

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:19.467
MAKES A COMMUNITY RESILIENCE-

01:32:19.533 --> 01:32:20.768
BUT THERE IS AN EFFORT UNDERWAY

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:22.103
JUST TO ESTABLISH A SET OF

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:23.604
INDICATORS THAT WILL DO THAT.

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:25.039
CERTAINLY HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP

01:32:25.106 --> 01:32:26.774
WITH A WITH A MORE DETAILED

01:32:26.841 --> 01:32:27.975

THAT FINING THOSE SORT OF.

01:32:38.886 --> 01:32:40.354
MEASURES ARE THE PART. PART OF

01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:41.923
THE WILDFIRE STRATEGIES GOING TO

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:44.525

THESE THE REGIONAL FORMS YOU

01:32:49.096 --> 01:32:51.766
DESCRIBE- YEAH I KNOW I DO THINK

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:53.301
THE REGIONAL FORMS ARE GOING TO

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:55.036
BE THE CIVIC CREASING LEE THE

01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:56.904
CENTRAL WAY WHERE WE GET THINGS

01:32:56.971 --> 01:32:59.240
DONE. I THINK FOLKS UNDERSTAND

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:01.509
THAT. AND WE'RE HEARING THIS

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:03.210

FIRE DISTRICTS SAYING. IF WE

01:33:08.182 --> 01:33:10.217
HAVE TO GET THE JOB DONE THROUGH

01:33:10.284 --> 01:33:13.521
COMPETITIVE GRANTS WE CANNOT.

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:15.289

TOWARDS SUSTAIN FINDING OF THESE

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:28.235
REGIONAL PLANTS. YEAH I'D BE THE

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:30.371
FIRST TO SAY THAT'S VERY HARD TO

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:33.274
DO IN YOU KNOW A SITUATION WHERE

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.810
BUDGETS ARE ANNUAL. SO WE'RE

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:37.478
TRYING TO COME UP WITH A WAY SO

01:33:37.545 --> 01:33:39.947
THAT WE CAN BLAND PARTICULARLY

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:43.050
SOME OF THESE. YOU KNOW ONE

01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:43.684
TIME. ASIANS OF MONEY WERE GAY.

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:45.820
THROUGH GRANTS TO AGENCIES SO

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:47.788
THEY'VE GOT SEVERAL YEARS OF

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:50.791
MONEY OVER TIME TO GET BLOCKS OF

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:52.793
PROJECTS DONE SO THAT THEY CAN

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.228
HIRE THE CONTRACTORS THE

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:56.597
CONSULTANTS THE CREWS. ARE VERY

01:33:56.664 --> 01:34:00.167
HARD TO DO WHEN YOUR- YOUR

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:01.602
FUNDING STRATEGY IN YOUR

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:03.738
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY YOU KNOW

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:05.706
IS BASED ON A QUESTION AS TO

01:34:05.773 --> 01:34:07.208
WHETHER OR NOT. YOU'LL GET A

01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:09.810
COMPETITIVE GRANT OR NOT-

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:11.379
THERE'S A LONG STANDING HISTORY

01:34:11.445 --> 01:34:13.581
THOUGH IN CALIFORNIA- GOING THE

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:15.750
COMPETITIVE GROUP ROUTE TO MAKE

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:16.917
SURE THE BEST PROJECTS GET

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:18.586
FUNDED SO WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:20.421
BLEND OVER TIME WE'RE

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:22.423
INCREASINGLY AS REGION'S

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:24.125
DEMONSTRATE TO ALSO THEY'VE GOT

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:26.193
SOLID PLANS. THAT HAVE BROAD

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:27.828
BASED SUPPORT THEIR PERFORMANCE

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:30.197
STANDARDS AND MONITORING THAT

01:34:30.264 --> 01:34:32.066
ONCE THEY CAN MEET THAT TEST AND

01:34:32.133 --> 01:34:34.402
HAVE A SOLID PLAN INCREASINGLY I

01:34:34.468 --> 01:34:35.536
HOPING THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE

01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:37.271
TOWARDS BLOCK GRANTS TO THOSE

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:38.906
ENTITIES SO THAT THEY CAN BE

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:41.075
DECIDING WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:43.144
IN THEIR REGION. RATHER THAN

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:45.579
FOLKS IN SACRAMENTO. AND MUSIC

01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:48.182
TO MY EARS IN TERMS OF- TRYING

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:49.984
TO GET AROUND THIS SORT OF

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:50.918
SPORADIC CYCLE ESPECIALLY AS

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:51.752
YOU'RE DOING CAPACITY BUILDING

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:54.989
IN AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE MUCH-

01:34:55.056 --> 01:34:57.658
BUT ON THAT NOTE I. I RECALL

01:34:57.725 --> 01:34:58.759
THAT WE DO HAVE A CONTINUOUS

01:34:58.826 --> 01:35:00.761
APPROPRIATION I THINK FROM THE

01:35:00.828 --> 01:35:02.663
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND ON

01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:05.399
AT LEAST SOME ASPECT OF OUR OF

01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:07.268
OUR WILDFIRE. MITIGATION

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:10.571
STRATEGY IS THAT HOW HOW MIGHT

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:12.306
YOUR TASK FORCE BE ABLE TO

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:19.146
ARTICULATE- SOME PRIORITY SAY.

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:20.314
FOR THOSE KINDS OF ON GOING

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:21.449
STREAMS- THAT THAT KIND OF ON

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:22.483
GOING SCREENING TO PROVIDE THIS

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:24.418
KIND OF. OR CAPACITY ASSISTANCE

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:26.220
IS THAT IS THAT ON THE TABLE.

01:35:26.287 --> 01:35:27.354
THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GREAT

01:35:27.421 --> 01:35:28.789
QUESTION I THINK AS WE MOVE TO

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:31.292
DEVELOP THIS CONCEPT FOR BLOCK

01:35:31.358 --> 01:35:32.560
GRANTS WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:33.894
WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND

01:35:33.961 --> 01:35:35.830
FINANCE TO FIGURE OUT. SOME

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.698
FUNDING STREAMS FROM BOTH THE

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.467
STATE SIDE IN THE FEDERAL SIDE

01:35:39.533 --> 01:35:41.535

TYPE OF COMPENSATION IT'S PRETTY

01:46:01.455 --> 01:46:03.690
RIDICULOUS. I SENT A MILLION

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:06.393
DOLLARS- THIS STATE SHOULD BE

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:09.329
COMPENSATING CRAB FISHERMEN FOR

01:46:09.396 --> 01:46:11.031
THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IF

WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT YET

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:22.476
THERE'S BEEN THIS. EXPECTATION

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:24.478
SINCE BEARS AROUND IN THIS STATE

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:26.313
THAT THE FLEET IS GOING TO DO IT

01:46:26.379 --> 01:46:27.914

BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGE SEASONS

01:46:29.816 --> 01:46:32.085

DIFFICULT POSITION OF HAVING TO

01:52:34.114 --> 01:52:35.381

AT THE PARK SYSTEM. I WAS

01:56:15.702 --> 01:56:16.836
SURPRISED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND

01:56:21.741 --> 01:56:23.543
ACTUALLY SURPRISED THAT THERE

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:25.845

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:27.880

MAINTENANCE IS SOMETIMES. THIS

01:56:42.695 --> 01:56:44.597
THE TREE LINE ON THE TRAIL HIGH
