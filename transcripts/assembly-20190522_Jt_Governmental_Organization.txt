HOLD A CANDLE TO THE SCRUTINY THAT IS APPLIED TO RACING IN CALIFORNIA. AND MOST OTHER RACING JURISDICTIONS. LAST NIGHT TWENTY FOUR MAJOR LEAGUE TEAMS PLAY BASEBALL GAMES. I STRONGLY DOUBT THAT THEY WIND UP THE PLAYERS. IN A LINE AFTER THE GAME. AND SAID YOU YOU YOU AND YOU. WE NEED TESTS. HERE'S YOUR CUP. WE DO THAT AFTER EVERY RACE EVERY DAY. OF COURSE OUR NEW SUBSTANCES THAT MAY NOT YET BE DETECTABLE. IT TOOK YEARS BEFORE BARRY BONDS AND LANCE ARMED ARMSTRONG WERE CAUGHT. WERE CAUGHT. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THE MEDI LAB KEEPS OUR SAMPLES FOR TWO YEARS FOR RETROACTIVE TESTING. UNTIL NEW TESTS CAN BE DEVELOPED. OTHER SPORTS ARE MANAGED BY LEGAL OFFICES. WE DON'T MANAGER RACING WE REGULATED. UNDER THE LAWS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE C. H. R. B. RULES AND REGULATIONS. EVERY POSITIVE TEST IS INVESTIGATED BY ONE OF OUR INVESTIGATORS. AND A COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST THE LICENSEE. THE BOARD TAKES EACH ONE VERY SERIOUSLY. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A COMPLAINT WAS FILED AGAINST A TRAINER FOR HIS THIRD CLENBUTEROL VIOLATION. AFTER THE HEARING THE BOARD SUSPENDED HIS TRAINER'S LICENSE THROUGH ITS TERM. AND FIND THAT TRAINOR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR THOSE VIOLATIONS. EVERYTHING WE DO IS IS ABOVE BOARD AND OUT IN THE OPEN. EVERY DISCIPLINARY RULING OR LOSS OF A HORSE IS REPORTED IN OUR WEEKLY STEWARDS MINUTES AND AND OUR WEB PAGE. IN THAT SPIRIT OF TRANSPARENCY I'D LIKE TO UPDATE YOU ON THE STATUS PHONE OF OUR INVESTIGATIONS. INTO THE FATALITIES AT SANTA ANITA. OUR THIRTEEN INVESTIGATORS ARE SWORN PEACE OFFICERS. WE HAVE FOUR OF THEM WORKING FULL TIME. ON THE TWENTY THREE NECROPSY INVESTIGATIONS. AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD IT'S A JOINT INVESTIGATION WITH THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. WE HAVE ISSUED SEVENTY SUBPOENAS SO FAR. IN INTERVIEWS OF VETERINARIANS TRAINERS AND JOCKEYS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THE HORSES ARE ONGOING. SO FAR WE'VE COMPLETED FORTY SIX OF THOSE INTERVIEWS. WE HAVE TWENTY ONE INTERVIEWS YET TO BE COMPLETED. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A VERY THOROUGH AND CAREFUL PROCESS WE ANTICIPATE THAT NEARLY ALL THESE CASES WILL BE COMPLETED. IN THE NEXT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE DAYS. AND FINALLY A NOTE ABOUT SAFETY WE ARE THE ONLY JURISDICTION IN THE COUNTRY WAS SAFETY STEWARDS ASSIGNED TO EACH RACE. TO ENFORCE RULES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE RACE HORSES. THESE SAFETY STORED SPEND CONSIDERABLE TIME THE STABLE AREAS AND ON THE RACETRACK. MONITORING THE PROPER TREATMENT OF HORSES. MISTREATMENT OF FORCES IS NOT TOLERATED. THE C. H. R. B. HAS A SUPPOSED HAS A SPECIFIC ANIMAL WELFARE PROVISION IN ITS REGULATIONS TO PROSECUTE CRUELTY. MISTREATMENT NEGLECT OR ABUSE. AND WHEN APPROPRIATE CASES CAN BE AND ARE REFERRED TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. I AM PLEASED TO REPORT TO THIS COMMITTEE. THAT THE WORST RACING BOARD CHAIRMAN WINNER AND MYSELF. HAVE HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. WITH KATHY GILL YERMO FROM PETER. AND JUDY MEN -- SO FROM SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION. WE TOGETHER HAVE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THAT WE BELIEVE CAN BE ACHIEVED. AND WE DO THANK. THAT IF WE'RE INVITED BACK. IN A SUBSEQUENT YEAR. BEFORE TOO LONG WE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THE CALIFORNIA RACING IS NOT ONLY THE SAFEST IN AMERICA. BUT AMONG THE SAFEST ANYWHERE. THERE ARE MANY MORE OF THOSE INITIATIVES ON THE BOOKS ARE IN THE REGULATORY PIPELINE. AND I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER THE DISCUSSION TO OUR VICE CHAIR. COMMISSIONER MADELINE AUERBACH FOR MORE ON THOSE MEASURES. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN DODD AND GERMAN GRAY. ON MEMBERS OF THIS JOINT COMMITTEE I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THE BOARD IS DOING EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO ENHANCE THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF OUR HORSES. BEGINNING WITH ITS MEETING IN MARCH THE BOARD HAS NUMBER ONE PRE AUTHORIZED THE RELOCATION OF THE RACE MEET FROM SENATE NEEDED TO LOS ALAMEDA IS. SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY BOTH OF THOSE PARTIES SHOULD THAT MOVED BECOME NECESSARY. TO WE HAVE SUSPENDED AUTHORIZED THRESHOLDS FOR ELEVEN ANTI INFLAMMATORY MEDICATIONS. AT ALL RACETRACKS IN CALIFORNIA THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS A ZERO TOLERANCE. FOR THE PRESENCE OF THESE MEDICATIONS AND POST RACE TESTS. EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE THERAPEUTIC DRUGS THEIR PRESENCE CAN HIDE OR MASK AND SOUNDNESS. EVERY RESOURCES EXAMINED BY THE STATE VETERINARIAN ON RACE DAY WHO WILL NOW BE BETTER ABLE RECORD. BE BETTER ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM SHOULD ONE EXIST. INTRODUCED REGULATORY LANGUAGE. TO STRICTLY LIMIT THE USE OF THE RIDING CROP THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE WILL ALLOW THE WRITERS TO CARRY THE CROP FOR SAFETY PURPOSES ONLY. IT IS BEING PREPARED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD. NUMBER FOUR WE'VE INCREASED THE OFFICIAL VETERINARIAN SAFETY STORED AND INVESTIGATORS STAFF. AT SANTA ANITA NUMBER. FIVE WE'VE GREATLY EXPANDED OUT OF COMPETITION TESTING WITH STIFF PENALTIES ALTHOUGH WE RARELY FIND PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES IN THESE TESTS. THIS REGULATION PUTS TEETH IN THIS PROGRAM. IN RACING IF THE MEDICATION IS NOT ONE OF THE FEW THAT IT IS EXPLICITLY PERMITTED THAN IT IS PROHIBITED. NUMBER SIX MARK REGULATORY LANGUAGE TO MAKE ME CROP TEE REDUCE MANDATORY. ALL FUTURE REVIEWS GOING FORWARD WILL INCLUDE OF C. HRB INVESTIGATOR THE OFFICIAL VETERINARIAN AND A KNEE CROPSEY STEWARD. REQUIRE TRAINERS TO MAINTAIN COMPLETE RECORDS OF ALL THAT NERI TREATMENTS AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE UPON DEMANDED THE EXAMINING VETERINARIAN IN A REAL TIME MANNER ON RACE DAY. OR ANY OTHER TIME AS REQUIRED. ELIMINATE THE USE OF THIS FASCINATES IN RACE HORSES ESTABLISH THRESHOLD LIMITS FOR CERTAIN PERMITTED MEDICATIONS DURING WORKOUTS. AND SEVEN AND OUR BOARD MEETING TOMORROW WILL DISCUSS CHANGES TO SEE HRB RULES. WITH RESPECT TO LIMITATIONS OF FOR DRUGS MIGHT LASIX. USE BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY UNDER CONSIDERATION WILL BE THE ELIMINATION OF LASIX FOR ALL TWO YEAR OLDS. AS WELL AS ALL HORSES RACING GRADED STAKES EVENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE ZERO TOLERANCE MEDICATION POLICY MENTIONED ABOVE. AND THE OTHERS TO COME CALIFORNIA IS NOW THE STRICTEST RACING JURISDICTION IN AMERICA. OUR GOAL IS TO LOOK BACK AND REALIZE THAT THIS WAS JUST THE START OF OUR COOPERATIVE EFFORT. TO MAKE RACING AS SAFE AS IT CAN BE FOR BOTH THE HORSE. AND THE RIDER. FINALLY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR LEADERSHIP. IN MOVING SB FOUR SIX NINE YOUR INTEREST IN THE INDUSTRY AND DESIRE TO STRENGTHEN THE AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD. TO ACT QUICKLY TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF BOTH HORSE AND RIDER IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED AND IT'S NECESSARY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DOC. YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME START TO REGARD DURING THE COIN MEDICAL DIRECTOR AT UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE I'M ASSIGNED FULL TIME TO THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD THROUGH AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT. MY ROLE IS TO LIAISON BETWEEN THE BOARD AND UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ADVISE THE BOARD ON MATTERS RELATING TO MEDICATION AND DRUG TESTING TO PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF COURSES. BESIDES THE COIN MEDICAL DIRECTORS CONTRACT THE SCHOOL CONTRACTS WITH THE BOARD FOR DRUG TESTING DR HEATHER CAN NATURE VETERINARY PHARMACOLOGIST WHO WILL. DISCUSS THE EQUINE -- MANDY EQUINE ANALYTICAL LABORATORIES DRUG TESTING PROGRAM IS HERE TODAY AND STILL COVER THAT THE THIRD CONTRACTORS BETWEEN THE SCHOOL IN THE C. H. R. P. FOR THE NECROPSY PROGRAM. AND THIS WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY AND IS CONSIDERED AN INTERNATIONAL MODEL. SHORTLY AFTER THE KNEE CRAPPIE PROGRAM BEGAN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT WE NEEDED DATA BETTER DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING THE NONPROFIT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EQUINE FOUNDATION -- IT IS BUILT A NUCLEAR IMAGING FACILITY AT SANTA ANITA AND SENT STAND TWELVE THOUSAND OVER TWELVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NUCLEAR SUMMIT GRAPHIC EXAMINATION. BEEN PERFORMED. TO IDENTIFY INJURIES TO THE HUMERUS SCAPULA PELVIS LUMBAR IN OTHER AREAS THAT ARE NOT AMENABLE TO REGULAR RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION. WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS FROM THAT SAME THE PROPERTY PROGRAM. AND FROM RESEARCH FROM MY COLLEAGUES THE UC DAVIS -- TO TO DEVELOP A STANDING POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY OR PET SCAN THAT'S A THREE D. NUCLEAR IMAGING MODALITY. THAT WE THINK WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY PRE EXISTING LESIONS IN THE FAT LOCKED PADLOCK BEING THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF BREAKDOWNS AND TO SET OR NOT. CURRENTLY AMENABLE -- TO DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING. THE PAD IS BEING ACQUIRED THROUGH A MAJOR DONATIONS FROM THE STRONG GROUP IN A CLINICAL VALIDATION. AT SANTA NEED IS BEING FUNDED FROM THROUGH A GRANT FROM THE GRAYSON JOCKEY CLUB RESET SEARCH FOUNDATION TO UC DAVIS. IN SPITE OF THE PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD THIS WINTER IT. TO SANITY THAT THE SCHOOL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WILL BE THE SECOND LOWEST NUMBER PATHOLOGIES CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. WE'VE REDUCE FATALITIES BY OVER YEARS OR SAFETY HAS BEEN A CONSTANT CONCERN OF THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD IS ANY REVIEW WITH THE MEDICATION SAFETY AND WELFARE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD -- WILL SHOW. THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE JOCKEY CLUB WELFARE AND SAFETY SUMMIT TO THOROUGHBRED SAFETY COMMITTEE IN THE NTR A ACCREDITATION PROGRAM. I HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF DIFFERENT TASKS THAT WE'VE DONE SOME OF THEM ARE REDUNDANT FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SO -- WE DO HAVE A A PREPARED MATERIAL THAT I'LL GIVE TO YOU LATER -- BUT YOU KNOW IT'S THE REALITY OF IT IS THAT NOBODY WANTS REGULATION UNTIL THERE'S A QUE QUE CATASTROPHE. IN EVERY NEW REGULATION HAS BEEN A BATTLE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BATTLE AND SOMETIMES -- ALE DOESN'T HELP. BUT REGARDLESS I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THE C. H. R. B. -- THINKS THAT THERE ISN'T MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. I KNOW WHY DON'T AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO MAKE RACING SAFER AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. DR. HI DR HEATHER CONNECTION PROFESSOR BASED OUT OF THE KALE MADDIE EQUINE IN LITTLE CHEMISTRY LAB. SO DOCTOR THIRTY TALKED ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD SO I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO SUMMARIZE THE LAB ITSELF AND THE DRUG TESTING PROGRAM. SO THE MEDI LAB IS ONE OF THE TOP IF NOT THE TOP DRUG TESTING PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS UNIQUE AMONGST OTHER DRUG TESTING LABS IN THAT IT'S COMPRISED OF BOTH A VERY ROBUST DRUG TESTING COMPONENT. AS WELL AS A VERY STRONG RESEARCH ARM. SO TO SPEAK TO THE DRUG TESTING ON THE LAB UTILIZES MASS SPECTROMETRY WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE. IS CONSIDERED THE GOLD STANDARD FOR DRUG TESTING. WE CURRENTLY HAVE METHODOLOGY IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS US TO SCREEN FOR NEARLY A THOUSAND DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS AND WE ADD TO THAT AS AS NECESSARY. TO LOOK FOR THESE COMPOUNDS IN BOTH BLOOD AND URINE SAMPLES. OUR LAB OPERATES UNDER AYSO SEVENTEEN ZERO TWO FIVE ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS WERE CREDITED BY A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF LABORATORY ACCREDITATION. WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST LAPS TO BE ACCREDITED BY THE RACING MEDICATION AND TESTING CONSORTIUM. AND WE'RE THE ONLY A UNITED STATES LAB TO BE CERTIFIED BY THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF HORSERACING AUTHORITIES. AS FOR THE RESEARCH COMPONENT AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES THIS LAB UNIQUE. IS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO RESPOND VERY QUICKLY TO WHAT WE REFER TO AS EMERGING THREATS SO MERGING THREATS MIGHT BE COMPOUNDS WHERE THERE'S RUMORED RUMORS OF ITS USE. OR SOMETHING THAT WE FIND ON A ROUTINE SCREEN THAT WE HAVEN'T PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED. AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE MAHDI LAB AND ONE THING THAT HELPS US REACT QUICKLY TO THESE EMERGING THREATS. IS OUR EXERCISE THOROUGHBRED RESEARCH HEARD THAT WE MAINTAIN THIS IS A HEARD THAT IS MAINTAINED BY THE LAB SO WE HAVE READY ACCESS TO THESE ANIMALS. THEY'RE ALL YOUNG EXERCISED THOROUGHBRED HORSES SO BY EXERCISED WE TRY TO KEEP THEM FIT USING A COMBINATION -- EXERCISE REGIMEN INCLUDING HIGH SPEED TREADMILL. SO THIS IS OUR ATTEMPT TO AS BEST WE CAN IN A CONTROLLED RESEARCH CITING. KIND OF MIMIC AT YOUR TYPICAL RESOURCE. SO HAVING ACCESS TO THESE ANIMALS AT ANY TIME ALLOWS US RESPOND LET US RESPOND VERY QUICKLY TO EMERGING THREATS WE CAN VERY QUICKLY ASSESS HOW COMPOUNDS MOVE THROUGHOUT THE ANIMAL SYSTEM WHERE THEY GO HOW THEIR LIMITED. THE PHARMACOLOGIC OR PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF THESE DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY FROM A REGULATORY SPECTRUM PERSPECTIVE WE CAN DEVELOP AND VALIDATE SENSITIVE ANALYTICAL METHODS THAT CAN THEN BE USED AS PART OF THE REGULATORY SCREEN SO WE REGULARLY TRANSFER THESE METHODS FROM THE RESEARCH ARM. TO THE DRUG TESTING PORTION OF THE PROGRAM. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN VERY PROLIFIC WE'VE PUBLISHED UPWARDS OF NINETY MANUSCRIPTS IN PEER REVIEW JOURNALS RELATED TO EQUINE PHARMACOLOGY. THIS INFORMATION IS THEN USED BY OTHER DRUG TESTING LABS BOTH FROM A MYTHOLOGICAL STANDPOINT AS WELL AS FROM. A REGULATORY STANDPOINT IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHING. REGULATORY RECOMMENDATIONS. THE LOCATION OF THE MADDIE LAB AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MORE SPECIFICALLY AT THE SCHOOL% OF VETERINARY MEDICINE ALSO PROVIDES A NUMBER OF BENEFITS TO OUR LAB. SO BEING PART OF THE VETERINARY SCHOOL ALLOWS US READY ACCESS TO INDIVIDUALS WITH WITH EXPERTISE IN MANY DIFFERENT AREAS. NOT ONLY DOES THIS INCLUDE PHARMACOLOGY IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY BUT ORTHOPEDICS EQUINE GENETICS DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING AND EACH EQUINE EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY. SO WE FORMED MANY COLLABORATIONS WITH THESE DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPERTS IN THESE FIELDS. AND THIS ALLOWS US -- TO PUSH FORWARD WITH OUR RESEARCH AND REALLY ADVANCE OUR RESEARCH DEVELOP NEW ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY COLLABORATING WITH AN EXPERT IN EQUINE GENETICS TO DEVELOP A NEW METHODOLOGY. THAT WE HOPE TO YOU USE IN THE FUTURE TO AUGMENT OUR CURRENT METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF THE BLOOD DOPING AGENT OR A THREE POINT IN. SO IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THIS NEW METHODOLOGY WILL ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DETECT ADMINISTRATION OF MICRO DOSES OF IVO THROUGH THE USE OF BIOMARKERS OF ADMINISTRATION SO ALTERNATIVE TECHNIQUES TO DETECTING DRUG ADMINISTRATION. AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE TO BEING PART OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE SCHOOL OF THAT MAN AS WE ARE ABLE TO USE THE UNIVERSITY'S INFRASTRUCTURE TO ADVANCE OUR RESEARCH GOALS. SO WE USE THE UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE THEY REGULARLY REVIEW ALL OF OUR ANIMAL STUDIES ALL OF OUR PROTOCOLS. THE VETERINARY FACILITIES TO HOUSE OUR HORSES THE TREADMILL THAT'S LOCATED AT THE VET SCHOOL AND THEN ALSO FACILITIES TO CONDUCT RESEARCH STUDIES. AND THEN LASTLY AS WELL AS BEING PART OF THE VET SCHOOL THE MOUNTIE LAB IS LOCATED WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY LAB AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. WHICH IS AN A. A. B. L. D. ACCREDITED LAB GIVING ADDITIONAL BENEFITS SUCH AS A BUILT IN SAFETY PROGRAM. BOARD CERTIFIED PATHOLOGISTS THAT SUPPORT THE KNEE CROPSEY PROGRAM AND OTHER SERVICES SUCH AS TOXICOLOGY. THE TOXICOLOGY GROUP IS ALSO I SO SEVENTEEN ZERO TWO FIVE ACCREDITED FOR COBALT TESTING IN SUPPORT OF THE CEDAR BE DRUG TESTING PROGRAM. AND SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR THIS AFTERNOON SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL TAKE SOME -- QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT IN TIME YES. YES THANK YOU OF THIS YEAR. THANK YOU FOR APPEARING TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING HERE AND IT WAS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S TAKING PLACE -- IF YOU CAN JUST KIND OF WALK US THROUGH -- DIRECTOR I UNDERSTAND WHO ARE TWENTY THREE HORSES AT WHAT POINT DID YOU GET. VETERINARIANS AND EVERYONE INVOLVED AT THE THE SIX PARTS SEVEN HORSE AND OURS WHEN DID IT IT BECOME AN URGENT URGENT MATTER WHERE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAD TO BE A CALLED AND WHICH ARE AN AUTOPSY DONE. WALK US THROUGH THIS WHOLE -- TRAUMA THAT YOU ALL WENT THROUGH. WE TRACK EVERY FATALITY AS IT OCCURS AND OF COURSE WHEN YOU STUDY. ANY KIND OF STATISTICAL OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. YOU ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ANOMALY. AND THE EARLY PART OF THE SENATE NEED A MEETING. WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RAIN. ACTUALLY THE NUMBERS FROM THE VERY FIRST PART WERE NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN PREVIOUS YEARS. BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THOSE NUMBERS BECAME MORE NUMEROUS -- WE IMMEDIATELY GOT DR ARTHUR INVOLVED -- SPOKE NOT ONLY WITH OUR OFFICIAL VETERINARIAN BUT THE TRACK VETERINARIAN ALSO THE RACING OFFICE AT SANTA ANITA. MANAGEMENT IS SANTA. AND THESE NUMBERS BEGAN TO ESCALATE RATHER RAPIDLY. WE TALKED ABOUT THE FRUSTRATION. ON THE PART OF THE BOARD. OF NOT BEING ABLE TO STEP IN AND STOP THINGS. AS A RESULT SENATOR DODD OF SOMEBODY GERMAN GRAY. HAVE MOVED THIS BILL AS BEFORE SIXTY NINE WHICH WILL GIVE THE BOARD THE AUTHORITY. IN FUTURE TO STEP IN AND ACT IMMEDIATELY. THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT SO I THINK THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION SIR IS THAT -- WE WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM FROM THE START. YET. I THINK THOSE PROBABLY IS FAIR TO SAY THAT WE EXPECTED THAT IT WAS AN ANOMALY AND THAT IS ENOUGH AS A MATTER OF FACT THINGS WOULD CALM DOWN. IN RETURN TO NORMAL. INSTEAD THEY RAMPED UP DRAMATICALLY IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME -- SO WE DID ACT WE TALKED MANAGEMENT AT SANTA ANITA. THEY DECIDED TO CLOSE TRAINING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS -- RE OPEN. AT ANOTHER FATALITY AND THEN THEY DECIDED TO SHUT DOWN ALTOGETHER. I THINK YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE REST OF THE TIME LINE. SO WE WERE INVOLVED EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AND DID YOU FIND THAT THOSE LAST TWO HORSES DIED I THINK THIS LAST WEEKEND. PERHAPS THIS SAME TYPE OF EITHER MEDICATION OR OR SOIL OR I MEAN HAVE YOU GOTTEN A CLUE WHAT THIS MIGHT BE SO WHAT I'LL GIVE THIS TO DOCTOR ARE THERE IN A MINUTE BUT THE ONE THING THAT STE MEDICALLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THE PREVIOUS ONES AND THESE. IS. MAYBE NOT AND MAYBE IT'S NOT ENTIRELY THERE BECAUSE WE DID OUR BRAIN RECENTLY BUT I THINK DOCTOR ARE THERE CAN COMMENT ON THIS BETTER THAN I CAN BUT THE EARLY ONES. CERTAINLY WERE AFFECTED BY THE FOURTEEN INCHES OF RAIN DURING THE SAME. PERIOD THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT GOT. TO SELL WAS CREATED A RATHER UNIQUE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN TERMS OF MAINTAINING THE RACETRACK SEALING IT OPENING IT BACK UP SEALING THE CEILING AGAIN -- AND I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION IT PUT VULNERABLE HORSES MORE AT RISK. THE FOCUS OF MANY OF THE THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR TODAY IS ABOUT BETTER IDENTIFYING THOSE VULNERABLE HORSES. AT THE BOARD ALSO WILL BE CONSIDERING SOME RESTRICTIONS ON TRACK MAINTENANCE GOING FORWARD DOCTOR ARE THROUGH YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE MEDICAL PART OF AND BEFORE YOU GO ON DR I I I ASK. FOR IN A RESULT OF AN AUTOPSY DID YOU CONDUCT ANY IS ALONG THE WAY. EVERY WORDS DIES WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE OF A BE RAISING YOUR CALIFORNIA. THE LABORATORY SITE SO THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER IN THE YOU KNOW WE DO THAT WITH YOU. EXACTLY SURE WE EVEN HAVE A A VERY ONLY IF THAT WAS ENFORCED -- THE PROPERTY SO WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THESE WE MONITOR I'M I WANT. EVERYONE. TO COME THROUGH SO THAT THAT IS STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR US. BUT GET YOUR SECOND QUESTION THE THE LATEST TO THE TALON THESE ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST -- TWENTY THREE ONE OF THOSE WAS SENT DOWN WHICH IS ABOUT 5% OF THE TRAINING AND RACING BUT ALEX OVER ALL. THE TWENTY TWO MUSCLES SO ALLEN THESE NINETEEN OF THOSE TWENTY TWO MORE OF THE FACT LOCKED. WOULD BE INCLUDING THE PROXIMAL SESAMOID BONE WHICH IS A BONUS VERY PRONE. TO EIGHT HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE -- A COMBINATION OF EIGHT EIGHT FRANKLY HARD TRACKS IN OVERTRAINING. AND WE'RE STILL IN A INVESTIGATION PART OF THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND BUT EIGHT THAT'S A PULMONARY STATEMENT -- SO I TAKE THAT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BUT YEAH YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE LAST TWO ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST. TWENTY TWO MY FELLOW THE LAST COUPLE QUESTIONS WE SHARE THE COMMON DENOMINATOR BETWEEN THOSE TWENTY THREE WERE ABLE TO DISCOVER THAT. IN THAT WHAT LED YOU TO TO GET THE THE TO THE DA'S OFFICE INVOLVED DID YOU SUSPECT SOMETHING. I WASN'T INVOLVED IN GETTING IT DA'S OFFICE INVOLVED I LOOK AT THIS MORE AS AN ACADEMIC -- IT -- EFFORT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THESE SOURCES FRACTURED AND HOW WE CAN AVOID IT I MEAN THEY THEY INVESTIGATIONS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE USUALLY DO -- BUT YEAH THEY THE COMMONALITY IS AT THE HORSES HAVE ACCUMULATED MORE HIGH SPEED EXERCISE IN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME. THE NICKEL HEARTS. THEN I CAN ADDRESS THAT INVEST THE DA'S PART OF THIS THING. WE DID NOT APPROACH THE DA -- OTHERS DID ASK THE DA TO GET INVOLVED. AND SO THE THE DAY DECIDED -- TO APPROACH US IN TO CONDUCT A JOINT -- CAN INVESTIGATION ON ON EACH OF THESE BAY TELL THESE THE SANITY TO RETRACT HAS SUCH A GREAT REPUTATION -- GOOD NUMBER OF YEARS JUST A JUST A BEAUTIFUL PLACE -- AND I'M SURE EVERYONE THERE IS IS COOPERATING AND TRY AND DO WHAT THEY CAN. OF WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR NEXT STEP IS GOING TO BE HERE THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. WELL WE'VE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS WE HAVE AND MANAGEMENT AT SANTA ANITA HAS YOU'LL HEAR FROM THEM A LITTLE LATER -- IN THIS HEARING -- SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO EVERYTHING THAT -- WE CAN POSSIBLY DO -- WE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM AT SANTA AT DEL MAR THREE SUMMERS AGO. AFTER THERE WAS A SPATTER OF FATALITIES NOT NEARLY AS BAD AS THIS BUT VERY ALARMING. AND WORKING WITH DOCTOR ARTHUR DOCTOR ARE THERE WITH THE OTHER OFFICIAL THAT'S PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY HORSES THAT WORK RISK. IT IS DOCTOR ARTHUR REFLECTED IN HIS COMMENTS WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED WITH SEEN JUST SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN WE HAD SEEN A 60% REDUCTION IN FATALITIES. SO THIS. EXPERIENCE AT SANTA ANITA. THIS YEAR -- STOPPED ALL OF THAT PROGRESS IN ITS TRACKS. AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED -- BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT NOT ONLY ALL OF THOSE CHANGES AND PROGRAMS THAT WERE PUT INTO PLACE AS A RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENED A DOWN MARKET. BUT MANY MORE JUST LIKE IT NOW WHETHER ON THE PART OF THE BOARD FOR THE PART OF MANAGEMENT AT SANTA ANITA. ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE HAVE THEIR AFFECT ON RACING GOING FORWARD. IT IT SOUNDS WEIRD TO SAY BUT I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WITH ALL OF THE SAFETY MEASURES NOW IN PLACE. RACING IS NEVER BEEN SAFER IN CALIFORNIA THAT IT IS. ODDLY PROBABLY PARTLY BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED. THANK YOU MISTER DIRECTOR -- THANK YOU CHAIR. CENTER CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU. FORGET MY VOICE A LITTLE RASPY TODAY -- YES TIME MASS SENATOR RUBIO I REPRESENT ACTUALLY SANTA NEEDED TO MY DISTRICT AND TELL. WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- I KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE ESPECIALLY FOR ALL OF US TOUGH FOR ME PERSONALLY THE SAFETY OF THE HORSES AND THE JOCKEY IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE SPOT. I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND YOU BECAUSE I KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW YOU STEPPED UP AND I DID HEAR ALL THE CHANGES THAT YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING CURRENTLY. AND I'VE ALSO MET UP WITH -- THE SONICS GROUP AND THEY ALSO SHARED SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT THE CONTENT. TO IMPLEMENTED I KNOW THAT THIS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S EMOTIONAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW MORE SUSTAIN. BUT I THINK THAT WORK ON THE RIGHT TRACK IN TERMS OF NOT BEING TO NARAL ON ONE TRACK VERSUS TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR CALIFORNIA. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- YOU MENTION AND I THINK IT WAS YOU DOCTOR ARE PRODUCT THERE YOU STATE YOUR DEVELOPING A SCANNED A PET SCANS SO WE DON'T HAVE. ONE CURRENTLY THAT WORKS OUT RIGHT AT THAT HAS BEEN USED. I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF THIS IS THE FIRST ONE THAT'S BEING -- DOCTOR NANCY SPRAY AT THE BATTERY RADIOLOGIST AT THE THE SCHOOL HERE IN DAVIS DEVELOPED THE TECHNOLOGY -- FOR POSSIBLY EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY IT'S THE FIRST ONE TIME IT'S BEEN USEDIN A HORSE. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING IS STANDING THEY THEY HAVE TO BE ANESTHETIZED FOR THE WITH THE WORK THAT HE DID ON CAMPUS. BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT -- HE'S DOING IN COOPERATION WITH A COMMERCIAL COMPANY IS DEVELOPING A STANDING -- P. ET SCAN WHICH ALLOWS THE HORSES NOT TO BE ANESTHETIZED AND BE EXAMINED AT SANTA ANITA OR FORTUNATE SANITY DO WE ALREADY HAVE A NUCLEAR IMAGING FACILITIES SO WE HAVE ALL THE NUCLEAR MEDICINE LICENSES. AND WE JUST MET EARLIER THIS WEEK WITH THE MANUFACTURE AND DOCTOR SPRY AT AND AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE IT THERE BEFORE -- BREEDERS CUP. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M IN THIS QUESTION IS. FOR I'M SORRY I DIDN'T GET YOUR NAME EARLIER TODAY FOR GETTING ME ONE SECOND HERE I THINK IT'S TIME DR HEATHER. WHAT I THINK IT WAS YOU I'M SORRY FIGHT I WANT TO AYE SOME TOO MANY WERE TALKING ONE OF YOU WERE YOU WERE EXPRESSING OF FINING YOU MET THE METHODOLOGIES TO DETECT DRUG ADMINISTRATION? CAN YOU TELL ME HOW LONG THAT'S GOING TO TAKE AND WHEN YOU SEE THIS BEING USED. THE ONE AT THE EXAMPLE I GAVE WAS THAT OF THE BLOOD THAT WE NEED. TO WAIT WHICH WE CURRENTLY DO HAVE METHODOLOGY PLACE TO DETECT -- USING OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY BUT WE'VE HEARD RUMORS OF MICRO. WE'VE HEARD RUMORS OF MICRO DISTINGUISHES ADMINISTRATION OF LOW DOSES WITH -- HOPING TO GET THE SAME EFFECT BUT YET CIRCUMVENTING DETECTION PROCEDURES SO WHAT WE ARE DOING THERE IS TRYING TO DEVELOP ESSENTIALLY BIOMARKERS. SO THINGS THAT CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO DRUG ADMINISTRATION SO THAT WOULD HELP COMPLEMENT OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY SO WE COULD POTENTIALLY DEVELOP THIS FOR OTHER DRUGS AS WELL. THANK YOU WELL ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT I THAT I WANT EXPRESSED OUT NOT ONLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS I STATED BEFORE IT IS IN MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW THAT SENATE EMPLOYS SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE CONCERNED THEY'RE WORRIED AND BEFORE. FOR ME PERSONALLY I WANT TO MOVE VERY CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT WE FIND OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE THIS BETTER SO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND THEN WE HAVE A SUSTAINABLE HORSE. RACING -- INDUSTRY THAT IS ALSO THAT THE INTEGRITY IS STILL INTACT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW KERRY THERE'S A LOT OF THIS -- CONCERNED ABOUT THE DOG BEING AND AND AND USING DRUGS ON HORSES SO. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT I ALSO WANT TO CAUTION LIKE I SAID ON MY COLLEAGUES TO MOVE VERY CAUTIOUSLY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE LISTENING. THAT WORKS THERE AND AGAIN I WANT TO BE VERY MINDFUL THAT THIS IS THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND SO I WANT TO MOVE WITH WITH DATA WITH EVIDENCE AND WITH INFORMATION ON OUR HANDS BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TRYING TO SELL THIS WITH US. REALLY APPRECIATE IT BILLS. OKAY -- I'VE I'VE I I'VE GOT A QUESTION AB ANYBODY CAN TAKE THIS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN -- AT WHAT A CATASTROPHIC INJURY IS AND WHY DOES IT ALMOST ALWAYS LEAD TO EUTHANASIA -- THE HORSE AND THEN MAYBE THE LAST THING IS. DO WE ALWAYS HAVE -- TO UTILIZE THEM IS THERE SOME OTHER. USE -- FOR THEM AB ONE THIS WORLD. YEAH I'LL TAKE THAT -- I'VE BEEN I STARTED PRACTICING A PRACTICE FOR THIRTY YEARS AND SANTA NEED IN PRACTICE OF MY FORTY SECOND OPENING -- DAY IT SANTA NEEDED THIS YEAR. AND THEIR HORSES STACKED -- WE WOULD USE A NICE BACK FORTY TWO YEARS AGO THAT ARE REPAIRED IN RACING TODAY -- MOST INJURIES ARE -- REPAIRED YOU KNOW FORCES GO TO OTHER CAREERS TO GO TO THE BREEDING CHAD -- SO THE THE CATASTROPHIC INJURIES OR IN ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING A FATAL INJURIES SO -- THEY'RE STILL AT RELATIVELY A SMALL PORTION OF THE INJURIES THE ATHLETIC INJURIES THAT OCCUR -- BUT THE PROBLEM WITH FORCES IS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE STANDING ON ALL ALL FOUR LEGS -- IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER SURGERY SO IT LIMITS YOUR ABILITY REPAIR SOME FRACTURES -- AND IT ALSO WAS. MY FINAL QUESTION APPEARS IT. IT IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT CONDUCT HORSE RACING RATES OF COURSE TO TELL THESE ARE LOWER. IT IN SOME INSTANCES MUCH LOWER. THAN THE RATES EXPERIENCE IN THE UNITED STATES DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON WHY THAT IS -- I I WILL TELL YOU MY INTERNATIONAL COLLEAGUES -- BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE OF ARE RELATIVELY LIBERAL -- MEDICATION POLICIES IN THE U. S. -- I'M NOT CONVEYANCE IS SET SIMPLE WE HAVE A CLAIMING OF GAME AYE AYE. YOU HAVE TO GET IN THE INSIDE BASEBALL BUT THERE ARE SOME BUSINESS ASPECTS OF COURSE RACING THAT PUT MORE STRESS ON HORSES TO TREAT HIM A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A COMMODITY. THAN THEY DO INTERNATIONALLY -- WE'VE TRIED TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE NEGATIVE IN ST TEAMS FOR NOT DOING RIGHT BY THE HORSE AND I THINK WE'VE BEEN FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL AT THAT -- THE ALSO RECENT TURF -- IN MANY OF THE EUROPEAN YOU -- OR INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS AS COMPARED DIRT IN CALIFORNIA -- IN DIRT IS A LESS FORGIVING SURFACED IN TURF. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I GUESS OF THE I HAVE. YOUR YOUR ANSWER -- MAYBE THING ANOTHER QUESTION -- DO WE RACE ALL YEAR ROUND HERE AND DO THEY RACE ALL YEAR ROUND EVERYWHERE ELSE -- THEY RACE YEAR ROUND IN AUSTRALIA AND THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY MAJOR JURISDICTION THAT I'M AWARE OF THE DOES -- TO EUROPE IS -- SEASONAL -- HONG KONG HAS ABOUT -- QUé -- SIX WEEKS BREAK. IN FACT THIS BREAK FROM SANTA NEED -- TO WHEN THEY WERE RE WORKING THE RACETRACK IS THE LARGEST BREAK THAT I CAN REMEMBER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RACING. IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR MORE. MISTER BECKER I GOT. SAY IT'S MY FINAL ONE BUT I YOU KNOW YOU BEEN CONNECTED RACING YOU ALMOST YOUR ENTIRE LIFE -- IF YOU SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE THIS THIS. SPIKE THAT -- THAT WE HAVE WITNESSED ITS INUNDATED -- NO NOT ANYTHING CLOSE THE THE ONLY OTHER EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD WAS -- THE ONE I REFERENCED AT DEL MAR -- WERE NUMBER FORCES DURING THE FIRST WEEK DOWN THERE -- WERE LOST AND AS AS I SAID THAT LED TO A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THAT CHANGED THINGS AND YOU KNOW WE WERE GOING REALLY MAKING GREAT PROGRESS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I IT WASN'T THIS WAY A LONG TIME AGO -- BACK WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN THE SPORT -- AND I THINK VERY SIMPLY THERE WERE MANY MORE. FORCES INVOLVED IN RACING -- CALIFORNIA WAS A PRIME OPPORTUNITY FOR A WORST RACE -- IF -- HORSE BECAME INJURED HERE -- YEAH. PROBABLY YOU KNOW WENT ON THE DISABLED LIST AND ANOTHER FRESH HORSE WAS BROUGHT IN -- THERE WERE ALMOST TWICE AS MANY FULLS OF BACK THEN AS THERE ARE NOW -- SO THAT HAS STRESSED TO THE RACING POPULATION WE WE DO REYES DAY AND NIGHT NORTH AND SOUTH IN CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND HORSES. IN NOT IN OUR CLOSURES IN CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDES CORE WORSEN HARNESS RACING -- SO THERE'S NO PRESSURE THAT THAT -- YOU KNOW FORCES ARE UNDER MORE PRESSURE. I WAS SO RELIEVED. THE RUBIO YES THANK YOU -- I JUST I I DID READ THE REPORT -- SOMEONE HANDED ME THEIR CAR FROM THE JOCKEY CLUB IN A TALKS AT A LOT ABOUT CHEATING IN THE INDUSTRY SOME I CAN ASK THIS QUESTION JUST BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU CAN HELP CLARIFY -- YOU FOR YOUR YOU STATED THAT WHEN THE HEART GETS INJURED THE MEDICAL RECORDS ARE GOING TO FOLLOW NOW THAT THE HORSE. AND I KNOW FOR US THERE'S STUFF SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE AS IT PERTAINS TO KEEPING YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS PRIVATE SO NO ONE CAN ALTER THEM SO IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE INDUSTRY THAT WOULD PREVENT SOMEONE FROM CHANGING THE RECORDS AND ALL TRAIN ANY. THAT INFORMATION TO TRY AND CHEAT THE SYSTEM. NO I DON'T THINK SO AS A MATTER OF FACT COURSE ANY OF THAT WOULD ONCE DISCOVERED WOULD AMOUNT TO A VIOLATION AND A COMPLAINT FILED AND IN THE IF IT WAS A VETERINARIAN. TO LOSE THE ABILITY TO PRACTICE IN RACING IN CALIFORNIA -- THERE IS A PROVISION IN THE VETERINARY MEDICAL LAW. THAT SAYS THAT ANY OTHER STATE JURISDICTION -- CAN REQUIRE AN EXCEPTION TO THE PRIVACY. LAW. AND SO AS A RESULT WE ARE ABLE TO REQUIRE THAT THE MEDICAL RECORDS ARE TRANSFERRED WITH THE HORSE. THAT [inaudible] THAT'S THANK YOU. I WAS FOR YOU. OTHER THAN THOSE FOR YOU THAT'S A RELATIVELY NEW -- PROVISIONS IN IN OUR RULES AND REX BUT WE'RE GONNA BE SEEING MORE THAT -- AS WE GO FORWARD TO THE POINT WHERE I THINK THAT WILL BE COMMONPLACE THAT THE RECORDS MOVE ALONG WITH THE HORSE FROM START. TO THE END OF HIS CAREER IS THERE ANY SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPER IN PLACE THAT. YOU CAN SHARE VIA THE INTERNET OR THROUGH TECHNOLOGY VERSUS PHYSICAL RECORDS AGAIN I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SOME CHINA CD CAN HELP EDUCATE ME ON THAT DOCTOR ARE THERE'S BEEN WORKING ON A PROGRAM WITH THE JOCKEY CLUB THAT'S COINCIDENTAL TO THAT. YEAH WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A PROGRAM -- FOR SEVERAL YEARS THAT WOULD ALLOW TREATMENT RECORDS TO BE -- RECORDED ELECTRONICALLY WE MAINTAIN NOW NORMAIS BOXES OF HAND WRITTEN HARD TO READ -- PAPER RECORDS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET ELECTRONICALLY RECORDED THAT WOULD BE MORE AMENABLE TO EASY TRANSFER MOST VETERINARY PRACTICES ARE COMPUTERIZED TODAY. SO THAT WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY WHERE THEY CAN TIE IN THIS THE TWO SYSTEMS TOGETHER SO THAT WOULD BE MORE. USER FRIENDLY BUT I I WILL TELL YOU THESE THINGS OR OR YOU SOUND EASY BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS MORE DIFFICULT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GET INTO TRYING. TO TO MASH UP MULTIPLE -- COMPUTER PROGRAMS TOGETHER BUT ONCE WE GET THERE THEN THAT DATABASE WILL BE SEARCHABLE. AND RELATABLE. SO WEEKEND THE EXPERTS THE DOCTORS CAN'T DISCERN ANY KIND OF PATTERNS ANY PARTICULAR INCREASING USE OF A PARTICULAR STE -- MEDICATION -- THAT MAY BE APPROPRIATE MAYBE NOT. AND SO WE OUR EXPERTS CAN BECOME MORE EDUCATED AS TO WHAT IS BEING USED. BY THE VETERINARY COMMUNITY ON THE BACKSIDE -- IT IS DOCTOR ARTHUR SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO NOW WITH THE OLD SCHOOL METHOD OF REPORTING. SO I HOPE TO SEE HAS GET THERE THANK YOU. IT'S A JOB FIRST AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. I THINK YOU'RE MY CHEN IS GERMAN -- I WALKED IN A LITTLE BIT LATE SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR INCOME IS BUT I HAVE. TWO BASIC CATEGORIES OF IT OF A QUESTION IS. THE FIRST A CATEGORY OF THINGS TO THE BECAUSE FOR THE DEBTS THE MOTHER PUT THAT. ON I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE SOME CONSULTANTS WHO WERE ON SITE EXAMINING TO SURFACE -- AND BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY RAIN THAT OCCUR PRIOR TO SO OFFICE SO SO QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WERE YOU ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OR CAUSES OF OF FOR THESE MULTIPLE DEBTS. AND OF THE SECOND CATEGORY OF OF THE QUESTION IS -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THE RACE TRACK LONG WAY TO THE AIRPORT ALL ADOPTED A NUMBER OF REFORMS INCLUDING THINGS LIKE -- THE PHASING OUT OF THE LEAST SICK AND THE LIMITED USE OF THE CROP ALSO THE SCANNING OF THE HORSES A PRIOR TO US IN THE LIGHT. OF SO I WAS WONDERING IF OF DUES MEASURES THOSE REFORM MEASURES ALL WOULD DO IT THE TEAM ADEQUATE FOR EXAMPLE TO AT LEAST CARP THE THE SITUATION OR YOU KNOW TO BASICALLY. TO ADDRESS IT TO ME. THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE COULD WE ADDRESS THE SECOND ONE BECAUSE WE HAVE AN EXPERT ON THE TRACKS HERE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE RIGHT FOR TODD SAID. DRESSES SECOND WHEN YOU CAN ASK THE FIRST QUESTION TO ANOTHER PANEL. THANK YOU. YEAH SO IN TERMS OF WHAT WE USED FROM THE INVESTIGATIONS -- I EXPLAINED IN MY REMARKS THAT THEIR ON GOING THERE WITH THESE ARE ENHANCED INVESTIGATIONS THEY INVOLVE A CH ARE BE SWORN INVESTIGATOR. AS WELL AS AN OFFICIAL VETERINARIAN AS WELL AS A STEWARD -- WE HAVE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE INTERVIEWS COMPLETED -- WE EXPECT TO HAVE THEM ALL DONE IN THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS OR SO -- AT THAT POINT WE'LL LEAVE IT -- TO THE DOCTORS LIKE DOCTOR ARTHUR THE OFFICIAL VETERINARIANS TO EXAMINE TE RESULTS OF THE NEW CROP SEES TO HELP US INTERPRET THE ANSWERS THAT WERE GIVEN IN THE INTERVIEWS -- AND IT'S POSSIBLE THEN THAT WE MIGHT DRAW SOME CONCLUSIONS SOME COMMON THREAD. IT'S NOT LIKELY FRANKLY BECAUSE EACH HORSE IS DIFFERENT MAY HAVE AT BREEZE KISSING CONDITIONS SOME MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT THE THE EXTREME WEATHER IN THE CONDITION OF THE RACE TRACK WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE. TO BEYOND A DOUBT RIGHT BUT WE CAN DRAW CONCLUSIONS BUT IT'S TOO SOON IF YOU KNOW ALL THESE INVESTIGATIONS. AS I STATED I THINK YOU WERE HERE WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE BEING DONE IN COOPERATION WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE SO THE VERY THOROUGH AND CAREFUL. THE KIND OF TAKE AS LONG AS THEY TAKE BUT ONCE THEY'RE DONE THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO EXAMINE THEM MORE [inaudible] THANK YOU. Q. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU GUYS GO OVER THE SPECIFICS LIKE WITH DIFFERENT BREEDS I'VE I'M A HORSE OWNER AND WE'VE GOT TO SEE WALKERS WE'VE GOT ARABIANS WE'VE GOT QUARTER HORSES AND I FEDERAL REST BEFORE. JUST FOR THE MEMBERS THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE IN THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURE IN THE BREEDS. AND THE BONE STRUCTURE AND IN. AND EVEN THE TEMPERAMENTS IF YOU ALL WANT. TO TOUCH ON THAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I THINK SOME MEMBERS THINK A HORSE IS A HORSE IS A HORSE. AND I I KNOW THERE'S A VERY VAST DIFFERENCE -- BUT MAYBE TOUCHING ON THAT BECAUSE I KNOW BONE STRUCTURE IS A LOT DIFFERENT I KNOW WHEN YOU DO INSURANCE WRITING YOU DON'T START. YOU DON'T GET HOME TILL THEIR FIVE WITH THIS REASON ON THAT TOO MOST ON DO A LOT BETTER -- THREE YOU KNOW IN THE DIFFERENT SPORTS HAVE DIFFERENT TIME LINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IT SPECIFICALLY BASED ON THE HORSE'S BREEDING IN THE BOND STRUCTURES IN THOSE THINGS FOR WHAT IS BETTER SO CAN YOU GUYS TOUCH ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. JUST TO KIND OF INFORMED. A LITTLE BIT MORE. IT'S ACTUALLY -- GETS INTO SOME PRETTY SERIOUS BONE PHYSIOLOGY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TRAINING THROUGH A BROWSER LINK OUT ANYWHERE BUT THEY THEIR THEIR BONES ACTUALLY RESPOND -- TO TRAINING -- IN THE HORSES OF COURSE ARE BORN WITH RESOURCE SKELTON'S THEY HAVE TO ADAPT AND TRAINING DOES THAT AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THE YOUNGER AGES -- THE BONE ADAPTS MORE CAREFULLY GET STRONGER GET STRONG ENOUGH TO BE AT A RATE SOURCING FACTORS DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THE LATER OR TO START -- THE MORE RISKS THEY ARE FOR INJURY. SO COURSES WORDS LIKE A RACE CAR THERE THEY HAVE IS LIGHT A BONUS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO CARRY THAT. HEAVY WEIGHT AROUND THE RACETRACK -- STANDARDBRED SWITCHER TROTTERS OR A LITTLE BIT HAVE YOUR BILL THERE'S MORE STYLE -- AND THEY'RE BIGGER GAIN CLEAR HORSES FOR THE MOST PART EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN GET HIM ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND QUARTER HORSES ARE MOSTLY THOROUGHBREDS TODAY BUT THERE'S SORT OF THE SPRINTER TYPES OR THE THE THE FULL BACK TYPE OF OF OF COURSES IN THEIR THEIR STOUTER THEY'RE STRONGER AND THEY GIVE. A ENORMOUS BURST OF SPEED FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. SO IT IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING. FOR YEAH BUT I MEAN I I KNOW THE DIFFERENCES BUT I DON'T KNOW FOR MY COLLEAGUES NECESSARILY DO SO CALLED ROLLERS ARE THE ONES WE SEE IN THE RODEOS. JUST MAYBE EDUCATING. MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES ON ON THAT MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL FOR YOU ALL YEAH THEY THEY THE DIFFERENCES ARE A I I DON'T WORK I I DON'T WORK MUCH WITH RODEO HORSES AND AND THE LIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE EIGHT DIFFERENT HORSES AFTER FOR USES WE DO HAVE THE DRAFT HORSES AT SANTA ANITA THEY USED TO PULL THE GATE AND THEY'RE STILL THERE FOR FOR THE PUBLIC TO LOOK AT IN THEIR BEER VERY HEAVY STYLE HORSES. BONES ARE ARE IS BIG IS AROUND IS MOST PEOPLE'S LEGS AND THEY JUST GO VERY SLOW WHEN THEY'RE VERY STRONG AND THEY THEY NEVER GET INTO PROBLEMS -- BUT THOROUGHBRED STATE ARE VERY HIGH CAN ANY SPORTS STATE THE ANIMALS THEY LOVE TO RUN -- THEY'RE VERY COMPETITIVE -- THEY BURNED BRED TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE RUN FAST FIRST THREE HUNDRED PLUS YEARS. SO -- YOU KNOW THEY THY DO ENJOY DOING WHAT THEY DO -- AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY'RE THEY'RE FAT AS COMPARED TO WHEN THEY'RE TURNED OUT. BUT THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT SIZES LIKE IS THAT WE EVEN HAVE MANY WORSE -- FORCES ON THE BACKSIDE THEIR PANTS. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU -- DOCTORS ARTHUR AND THE KITCHEN IS A LOTS OF THAT RIGHT THIS DOES CORRECT YES THANK YOU BOTH. FOR BEING HERE MISTER BOEDEKER AND MISS OUR BACK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR EXPERTISE AND YOUR ALL OF YOU. THANK THANK YOU.

THEIR DIETS EXERCISE AND DAILY REGIMEN ARE CAREFULLY OVERSEEN BY EQUINE PROFESSIONALS THEY'RE SUBJECT TO PRE AND POST RACE EXAMINATIONS AND TESTING. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CREATING AND PAYING FOR THE SAFE AS A VARMINT POSSIBLE FOR THESE ATHLETES TO RAISE AND TRAIN. IN ALMOST INCIDENTS OF SERIOUS INJURIES AT ST YOU THIS WINTER SERVES AS A REMINDER WE CAN ALWAYS STRIVE TO IMPROVE AND ENHANCE OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE THINGS SAFER FOR HORSES. THAT'S WHY WE'VE ENDORSED REFORM MEASURES RECENTLY PUT IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT OFFER ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS THE HORSE AND RIDER INCLUDING WE'RE RAMPING TRAINING PROTOCOLS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL THAT NERI CHECKS.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR COMING BEFORE US TODAY -- COULD YOU REFER TO THE THREE STRIKE RULE CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO THREE STRIKE RULE IS. THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION. AND THEN THE SECOND OKAY. IN THE SECOND QUESTION I WILL BE WHAT DO YOU THINK OR WHAT COULD WE DO TO TRY -- TO ASSIST AND HELP IN THIS EFFORT. OFFER SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN LOS ANGELES -- WHO TRAVEL WITH MY MY DADDY WHO WENT -- TO HOLLYWOOD PARK AND I HAD AND I GREW -- FONDNESS OF THE HORSE INDUSTRY AS A RESULT OF THAT -- WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY CONTINUES OTHER WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IT'S BETTER FOR ALL. INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED SO WHAT CAN WE DO IT IN ORDER TO HELP MAKE IT BETTER I'M AS A STATE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS AND THEN PLEASE EXPLAIN A THREE STRIKE RULE. TO LIST THE THREE STRIKE RULE IS IS. YOU. THREE STRIKES IF YOU NEED THEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO GIVE A HORSE A CHANCE TO RESPOND YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP KEEP WRITING THEM. AGAIN IT HAS TO BE WITH THE WITH THE MANDATORY CUSHION CROP. WHICH IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN ONE OF YOU EVER SEEN WHEN YOU CAN FEEL IS A LOT LIKE A NERF -- THING SO IT MAKES A LOT OF NOISE IN THE CRAP IS USED FOR FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT REASONS I MEAN FIRST OF ALL SAFETIES IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REASONS THAT IS USED FOR BUT YOU KNOW REALLY HE KEEPS ALL YOU CAN YOU CAN ENCOURAGE A HORSE. IN A SAFE MANNER. YOU CAN KEEP HIM FOCUSED AS YOU SAW IN THE KENTUCKY DERBY HORSES DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO RUN STRAIGHT SO IT ALSO HELPS SHE GUIDED TIMES BUT IT'S IT'S IS THE NECESSARY TOOL THAT WE REALLY REALLY REALLY HAVE TO HAVE. AND AS FAR AS WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER OF THESE PRE RACE EXAMS -- WHATEVER WE COULD DO IS A WRITER -- IN ON POLICING OURSELVES IN AND AND LET EACH OTHER KNOW THAT IF SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT. YOU KNOW JUST TO HEAD STRAIGHT OVER TO THAT NEVER ENDS YOU KNOW AND AND AND NOT TAKING ANY ANY RISK AND IT'S RISKY ENOUGH AS IT IS BUT WE CAN ALL DO BETTER WE'RE ALL GONNA WORK HARDER AT IT -- AND AND WE'VE BEEN DOING SO I MEAN TRUST ME MY LIFE ON THE LINE EVERY TIME I GO OUT THERE AND I I'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT THERE UNLESS I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THAT IS SAFE AND AND LIKE I STATED EARLIER I HONESTLY FEEL NOW THAT I I RIDE. IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT THAN I EVER DID WHEN I FIRST UNDER RIGHT NOW BEEN GOING THIRTY YEARS. WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER WHAT CAN WHAT CAN STATE DUE TO HELP? AND ASSISTANCE EFFORT. A SECOND SIR WHAT CAN THE STATE DO. TO HELP. WAS FOR IS IS. IT A LOT OF THAT WOULD BE BOB COMPLAINTS OF A LITTLE BETTER FOR YOU BUT AS FAR AS A WRITER AND AND WHAT WHAT WHAT WE COULD DO IS. WE'RE WE'VE BEEN PRETTY HAPPY WITH WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE DONE BUT WE NEED TO WORK MORE WITH WITH WITH VETERINARIANS AS FAR AS IS IS PRE PRE RACE -- EXAMINATIONS YOU KNOW IT AND WE WERE WARMING UP IN THE POST PARADE MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING'S RIGHT AND IF THERE'S SOME OTHER MIDDLE STRONGER RULES THEY NEED TO PUT IN THE WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH ANYTHING THAT YOU NEED TO DO. SO IS A VETERINARIAN. ON SITE. YES SIR. AND THE CHECK OUT THE HORSES BEFORE THE CONVERTED NORTH DISINTEGRATE YES SO THERE IS A MATTER OF FACT A LOT OF TIMES ESPECIALLY ON ON YOU KNOW DERBY DAYS OR EVEN REDUCE COMPANIES THERE'S THERE'S FOUR FIVE OF THEM ON SITE. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA AYE AYE RACE ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA IS PROBABLY THE MOST REGULATED STATE I MEAN WE REALLY. I MEAN WE GO THE THESE HORSES THEY HAVE TO JUMP. A JUMP THROUGH A LOT OF HOOPS BEFORE THEY GET THAT STERN GAME AND AND SO IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY WHAT HAPPENED THIS WINTER LIKE I'M VERY FORTUNATE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WELCOME WOULD BUT YOU KNOW YOU YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHEN IT MIGHT HAPPEN YOU KNOW. THIS HORSE IS THE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT CAN AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T YOU KNOW SOMETHING HAPPENS AND SO -- I I JUST REALLY I WAS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE OF K&lt;c.cyan&gt; HAPPENING AND I KNOW&lt;/c&gt; THE WEATHER YOU KNOW PLAYED A BIG PART IN IT. BUT IT WAS -- YOU KNOW I WAS YOU KNOW I I'VE ONE MIGHT TO TRIPLE CROWN HORSES TRAINED ON THAT SAME SERVICE YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER AND MARK DERBY HORSES I MEAN CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST POP FOUR OUT OF FIVE WITH THE DERBY FAVORITE AND THEY'D ALL TRAIN IT'S AND THE THE THIS WINTER SO. IT WAS JUST SOMETHING NOT ON I CAN'T SPEAK. WITH THE WHY -- BUT IT WAS UNFORTUNATE BUT I REALLY THINK WITH EVERYTHING THEY PUTTING IN PLACE NOW I THINK. I THINK THE TRAINERS AGAIN DO A BETTER JOB POLICING THEMSELVES EVERYBODY I MEAN. YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN -- OF IT'S BEEN SOME ON HARD TIMES YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH US AND NEED A ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL. TRACK IN THE IN THE COUNTRY AND IS IT'S IT'S A SHAME THAT WAS PUT IT'S BEEN UNDER THIS KIND OF SCRUTINY. THANK YOU CENTER RUBIO. THE HOUSE THE FIRST QUESTION BUT I'M SORRY I MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THE FIRST -- HELLO BUT MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER THIS I'M A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD. THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD I ANOTHER SEVEN MEMBERS CAN YOU TELL ME THERE'S ANY EXPERTS ON THE BOARD AS IT PERTAINS TO THE TO THE INDUSTRY. HAVE RACE BEFORE JOCKEYS ANYBODY THAT HAS THAT KIND OF DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE. YEAH YES THERE IS ACTUALLY -- THERE'S A JOB THESE NAMES ALEX LEASES ON THE BOARD AS WELL. BUT A LOT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE OWNERS OF RESOURCES -- I'M NOT TOO SURE IF THERE'S A TRAINER ON THE BOARD. I'M SURE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST BUT BUT I'M NOT SURE THERE IS RIGHT NOW BUT BUT A LOT OF OUR OUR OWNERS IN IN -- THERE IS ONE ONE JACQUI THIS ON THE BOARD. THINKING OUT HOW TO CHANGE UP INTO THE IN MATTER OF FACT. I THINK IT'S REMEMBER CHAO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF I COULD FOLLOW UP -- ON MISTER GIBSON'S QUESTION SO CURRENTLY.

WE GET ABOUT. AND WE JARGON BACK AND FORTH YEAH. YOU KNOW YOU CAN TELL THE HORSE'S GAIT IF THEY'RE HOW THEY FEEL AND AND THESE VETS THAT THAT ACTUALLY THAT THAT ARE EXAMINING. THEY KNOW MOST OF THE HORSES THEY HAVE NOTES ON EVERY HORSE IF THERE'S ANY CHANGE AT ALL THEY MAKE A NOTE OF IT. SO THERE ITS THIRD THERE UNDER A LOT OF SCRUTINY SOURCES SO -- AND YOU DON'T SEE THAT ANYWHERE OF ME CALIFORNIA IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY TOUGH. FOR THAT'S WHY I WAS VERY SURPRISING WHAT'S GOING ON THIS WINTER AND SO -- IT'S ACTUALLY -- IT'S PRETTY. YOU KNOW STRICT RULES WE HAVE. THE NEED TO ADMINISTER LATELY SICK FOR EXAMPLE WHEN DOES THAT -- CAN ADMINISTER. HELLO DEBTS IN MINISTERED BY A THIRD PARTY BY THIS. STATE APPOINTED -- BATS -- THAT THE MINISTER FOR HOURS PRIOR.

CENTER BRADFORD YES I'M SURE SAID I MISS IT HOW MANY HORSES RUNNING CALIFORNIA I OR OR RUN ON A ANNUAL BASIS I THINK LAST YEAR THERE WERE AS BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX THOUSAND THOROUGHBREDS. OKAY AND OF THAT FIVE SIX THOUSAND HOW MANY INJURIES DID YOU HAVE WASHER. I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION FOR THE C. H. EVERITT ON TAX ARE. AND I I JUST WANT TO THINK ARMS BRADFORD AND THE INDIVIDUALS WHO GAVE ME TO OUR NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. SENATE NEED TO AND I TOTALLY AGREE I WAS. THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED -- I GREW UP RIDING HORSES BUT I LEARNED SO MUCH THAT DAY AND HA. IT'S ONE THING I KNOW FOR SURE THAT SAFETY OF THE HORSES AND SAFETY OF THE JOCKEYS ARE PARAMOUNT ON EVERYTHING THAT I SAW IN NEW FARM AND IT WAS. AMAZING SHOW -- AS A LEGISLATOR WE DEFINITELY WANT TO PRESERVE THIS INDUSTRY FOR SURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S UNIQUE IN ITS -- SPECIAL -- I AT HOLLYWOOD PARK IN MIGHT TWO STRICKEN WITH NO LONGER HAVE THAT RACETRACK SO -- BUT WHATEVER WE CAN DO. TO GUARANTEE ANIMAL AND JOCKEY SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS BUT AGAIN ON YOU GUYS ARE THE EXPERTS -- ARE WE CAN ASSIST AND I THINK MISTER BAFTA CHIP ON CALIFORNIA'S THE MOST REGULATED. STATE IN ANY INDUSTRY SO WELCOME TO THE CLUB OF JEAN OVER REGULATE OUR THE OTHER QUESTIONS. XENA GENTLEMAN IT MAY HAVE BEEN SHORT DURATION BUT WE GOT A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION FROM YOU. REALLY APPRECIATE THE YOU COMING TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER -- NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE BACK TO THE SECOND GROUP WHICH IS. THIS IS GONNA BE ON THE SCENE IN THE TO UPDATE PRACTICES MOVING FORWARD. BLOOM DISTRAUGHT AGE -- CHAIRMAN OF IT PRESIDENT OF THE STROLLER GROUP. I A DOCTOR DION BENSON CHIEF BENNETT VETERINARIAN OFFICER FOR THIS PRODUCT GROUP. IN ONE TO BE NAMED LATER. GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD EVENING -- MY NAME IS BELINDA STRONACH I'M THE CHAIRMAN AND THE PRESIDENT OF DESTROYING A GROUP. PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES FOR MY MY VOICE I I DID A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH TALKING ON THE WEEKEND. AS WE HOSTED THE PREAKNESS -- I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LIMITED -- TIME TO SPEAK BUT WE'RE VERY PROUD. OF SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED MOST RECENTLY AT SANTA ANITA. WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS WITH THE TOC. WITH THE CITY TO THE TRAINERS WITH THE JOCKEYS. AND ALSO WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE C. H. R. B.. WITH ME HERE IS OUR WHO -- AN EXECUTIVE WHO USUALLY CHOI WHO JUST JOINED US -- INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED VETERINARIAN -- EXPERT -- DR DEANE BENSON. AND ALSO THE PRESIDENT OR RACING DIVISION MIKE ROGERS SO. I'M ONE OF THE BELIEVERS THAT THE HORSE RACING IS REALLY THE LAST GREAT SPORTING LEGACY PLATFORM. THAT REALLY NEEDS TO MODERNIZE. AND WHEN I FIRST FOLLOWED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF OUR FAMILY BUSINESS. MY FOCUS WAS REALLY ABOUT. HOW DO WE TURN AROUND THIS INDUSTRY THAT IS DECLINING? IN POPULARITY AND HOW DO WE ATTRACT NEW GUESTS AND NEW FANS TOUR SUPPORT. SO MY FOCUS WAS REALLY ABOUT. THE GUEST EXPERIENCE HOW WE CAN ENHANCE THAT HOW WE CAN MODERNIZE OUR FACILITIES HOW WE CAN CURATE A COMPELLING. ENTERTAINMENT OFFERING OF WHICH HORSE RACING AND WAGERING IS AT THE CORE. AND YOU KNOW APPLYING TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AND NEW FORMS OF WAGERING IN BETTER. BUT AS I GOT MORE INTO IT AND THEN TOGETHER WITH THE WITH THE VERY UNFORTUNATE SERIES OF EVENTS. WAS RECENTLY AT SANTA ANITA. MY FOCUS IN TOGETHER WITH OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM TURN TO THE INJURIES AND THE CATASTROPHIC INJURIES AT SANTA ANITA. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT TO OF THOSE LESS FAMILIAR WITH OUR WITH OUR INDUSTRY IN OUR SPORT. THE STRONG GROUP IN SANTA NEED AND ALSO GOLDEN GATE FIELD HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE THE PLATFORM. AND WE ARE ALSO A STAKEHOLDER INDUSTRY THAT MEANS WE NEED THE JOCKEYS WE NEED THE TRAINERS WE NEED THE HORSE OWNERS WE NEED THE VETERINARIANS. AND WE NEED EVERYBODY TO WORK TOGETHER. TO TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS STAKEHOLDERS QUIRK REALLY WORKS. AND WITH THE WITH WHAT HAPPENED -- IN THE RECENT MONTHS WITH THE INCREASING THE CATASTROPHIC ENERGY ENTRIES WHAT WE DID IS WE SAID WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM. THAT MAKES UP OUR SPORT AND RACING AT SANTA ANITA. AS WE WERE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I THINK BOB BAFFERT HAD TO LEAVE. BUT HE WAS IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION WHERE HE WAS ONE MORNING GIVING AN INTERVIEW -- WITH FOX TELEVISION LIVE. AND WE SUDDENLY HAD ANOTHER CATASTROPHIC INJURIES. AND THAT WAS A VERY DEVASTATING MOMENT FOR EVERYONE THAT WITNESS TO THAT MOMENT. AS AN EXECUTIVE TEAM WITH AND SAID LOOK WE REALLY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING NOW. THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT WE HAVE REALLY TO HAVE COURSE WELFARE AND WRITER WILL FOR AT THE CENTER. OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DO. IT WAS IN MID MARCH THAT WE ISSUED THAT OPEN LETTER. TO THE PUBLIC THAT STATED WHAT OUR INTENTIONS WERE. AND THAT WILL GO INTO THAT IN A MINUTE. I THINK WHAT MOST IMPORTANT WHAT. BUT THAT THOSE REFORMS OF WHAT. WHAT WHAT THAT LED TO IS? I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA RACING IS NOW THE SAFEST IN NORTH AMERICA. WE HAVE MOVED TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON ALL. OTHER CONSISTENT WITH OR BETTER THAN INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. EXCEPT FOR LASIX. AND WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR A PHASE OUT OF LASIX. AND WE'VE STATED THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ALL TWO YEAR OLDS WILL BEGIN TO RUN WITHOUT LASIX. AND FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR CAREERS WILL NOT HAVE LASIX WE'VE ALSO COMMITTED TO STAKES RACES. BEING LASIX FREE SO IT IS MY HOPE THAT IN BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE THAT WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE FORCES RUNNING ON LASIX. WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. THAT ARE I BELIEVE WE'RE SEEING SOME OF THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES AS IT RELATES TO THE PROTOCOLS MUCH MORE STRINGENT PROTOCOLS. REGARDING WHICH HORSES TRAINED AT OUR FACILITIES. AND FOR EXAMPLE HAVING TO SIGN UP FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN ADVANCE WILL WORK OUT. MEANS THAT THE APPROPRIATE TIME CAN IS THERE FOR THE INTERVENTION. IN CASE THERE ARE SOME COURSES THAT MAY NEED THAT EXTRA INTERVENTION WHERE WE TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT IS THAT OF COURSE. TRULY FIT TO TRAIN. WE ALSO MADE THE COMMITMENT TO UP MAKE AVAILABLE STATE OF THE ART DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT MANY OF THE OWNERS AND TRAINERS ARE UNAWARE OF SOME OF THE INJURIES THAT THEIR HORSES MAY HAVE SOME OF THOSE PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. SO TRUE TO OUR COMMITMENT OF WHAT WE STATED WE HAVE INVESTED IN THE ACQUISITION OF A P. E. T.'S CAM WHICH DOCTOR BENSON CAN SPEAK. OF MUCH MORE KNOWLEDGE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THAN THAN I CAN -- THE OTHER THING THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AND HOW DO WE ENHANCE THE TRIAGE PROGRAM. WHEN THERE IS AN INJURY ON THE TRACK THAT THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE ATTENTION GIVEN TO THAT HORSE? AND THAT NOT IN ALL CASES THAT HORSE IS A EUTHANIZED THAT WE REALLY TAKE A LOOK CAN THAT HORSE BE SAVED. CAN -- CAN SURGERY OCCUR AND CAN THAT HORSE BE THEN -- INTRODUCED INTO ANOTHER ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT CAN LIVE -- UP UP THE REST OF HIS LIFE. AND THE OTHER. PART THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ALSO. I BELIEVE MAKING VERY GOOD IN ROADS IS THE AFTER CARE PROGRAMS AND I KNOW THAT OTHERS WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT KARMA -- TO FOLLOW. SINCE WE HAVE REOPENED SENT TO NEEDED JUST TO PUT A LITTLE CONTEXT AROUND THINGS. WE'VE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND SESSIONS ON THE TRACK SO HUNDRED THOUSAND HORSES WHETHER BE RACING TRAINING OR WORKING OUT. WE'VE HAD TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SINCE THE OPENING OF THE SEASON SINCE THE TWENTY SIXTH OF DECEMBER. WE'VE HAD FIFTEEN HUNDRED HORSES RACING WE'VE HAD OVER SEVEN THOUSAND WORKOUTS WHICH MEANS THOUSAND HORSES GALLOPING. AND EVERY SINGLE DAY WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTEEN POINT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED HORSES ON THE TRACK. THOSE ARE VERY HIGH NUMBERS. AS I SAID EARLIER AND CHAIRMAN GRAY OPENED WITH THIS THAT. CALIFORNIA RACING IS THE GOLD STANDARD WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA RACING IS THE GOLD STANDARD. HAVING MORE WORK I WOULD DO WELL WE'VE COME QUITE AWAY WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS AN ONGOING. EXAMINATION THAT SHOULD OCCUR CAM WE DO THINGS BETTER. TOGETHER WORKING WITH OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS CAN WE MAKE THINGS SAFER CAN WE FIND A BETTER RACING SURFACE CAM WE INSTITUTE BETTER PRO PROTOCOLS -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE AS WE MOVE FORWARD CALIFORNIA RACING WE WANT TO SEE CONSISTENCY ACROSS ALL OF CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE STANDARDS ARE CONSISTENT. ALSO IMPORTANT IS THAT AS WE HAVE THE GOLD STANDARD HEARING CALIFORNIA IN NORTH AMERICA. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT THE GOLD STANDARD MOVES ACROSS NORTH AMERICA AND THAT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY. LOOKS AT THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BECAUSE IF IT'S GOOD FOR CALORIE CALIFORNIA RACING. AND GOOD FOR THE HORSES HERE AND THE WRITERS IN CALIFORNIA IT SHOULD ALSO BE. GOOD FOR HORSES ELSEWHERE IN THE HEALTH AND WELFARE FORCES ELSEWHERE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE THAT THERE IS GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN OUR SPORT. IN TERMS OF CONSISTENCY WITH RESPECT TO REPORTING CATASTROPHIC INJURY SO WE CAN SEE. WHO IS DOING IT RIGHT AND WHO ISN'T DOING IT RIGHT? AS WELL WITH RESPECT TO TRAINERS WHEN THERE'S A TRAINER THAT HAS AN INFRACTION IN ANOTHER STATE. WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENCY THERE. AS WELL WE'VE I THINK MADE GREAT WRECKED PROGRESS TOGETHER WITH THE C. H. R. B.. WHERE VETERINARY RECORD SHOULD FOLLOW THE HORSE AND SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT FROM THAT TO THAT? I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT. AS I HEARD SOME OF THE SPEAKERS BEFORE -- WE WE COULD HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF CHUCK WINNER AND THE ENTIRE SEIZURE BE THEY MOVED VERY QUICKLY. BUT I ALSO HAVE TO COMMEND MY INDUSTRY PARTNERS BECAUSE IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE COLLABORATION WITH THE SEAT. THE C. D. T. WITH THE TOC. WITH THE JOCKEYS WITH DEL MAR WHERE THE INDUSTRYGOT TOGETHER AND SAID WE REALLY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. AND I THINK BECAUSE WE GOT TOGETHER AND IT WAS INDUSTRY LEAD WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY. THROUGH THESE CHANGES AND THE CA TURBIE ALSO RESPECTED THAT AND WAS ON THE SAME PAGE AS WE WORK AND AND I BELIEVE IT WAS THAT. A COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVENTS AND DESIRE TO MAKE CHANGE AND PROGRESS IN REFORMS THAT HAS BROUGHT US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. SO -- ON THAT NOTE I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO DR BENSON. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR DION BENSON I'M THE CHIEF VETERINARY OFFICER FOR THE STRONG A GROUP. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE TODAY -- IT'S SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME UP SURROUND THINGS LIKE COURSE EXAMINATIONS AND ONE OF THE JOBS THAT I'VE HAD UNTIL THE THIRTY DAY THIS YEAR WAS I WAS A VETERINARY. A REGULATORY VETERINARIAN AT IN KENTUCKY. SO I'VE DONE THESE EXAMS. AND SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE MADE. WILL HELP. VETERINARIANS DO THESE JOBS BETTER -- PLACED HER OUR BOOK REFERENCING CHANGES REGARDING CORTICOSTEROIDS AND NON% STEROIDAL ANTI INFLAMMATORY. THESE MEDICATIONS BY SEPARATING THEM FROM BRACING ALLOW. THE REGULATORY VETERINARIAN WHEN THEY LOOK AT THAT HORSE AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING. THE DAY THAT IT RACES. TO FEEL EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON WITH THE HORSE TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION HAVE BETTER ABILITY TO DIAGNOSE THE HORSE -- FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T AWARE THOSE HORSES ARE LOOKED AT ONCE IN THE MORNING THERE LOOKED AT IN THE PADDOCK BY REGULATORY VETERINARIAN THERE LOOKED AT IN THE POST PARADE SO THAT FROM THE MINUTE THEY LEAVE THE PADDOCK TO GO TO THE GATE THEY WARM UP. THEY ARE THERE OBSERVE BY A REGULATORY VETERINARIAN -- IN ALL OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENHANCED BY THE RULES THAT THE STRONG A GROUP ENCOURAGED AND MORE ADOPTED BY THE C. H. R. B. -- REGARDING CORTICOSTEROIDS AND NON STEROIDAL ANTI INFLAMMATORIES -- ALSO. THE TRAINING REGULATIONS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE ARE TRULY THE GOLD STANDARD NOT JUST IN NORTH AMERICA BUT IN THE WORLD. THERE AREN'T THERE ISN'T ANOTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE. HORSES ARE REGULARLY OBSERVED TESTED. AND CHECKED BEFORE WORKING -- TRULY THAT IS A ONE OF A KIND PROGRAM AND SOMETHING THAT WAS PUT INTO EFFECT. AFTER THIS RECENT EVENTS THESE RECENT EVENTS -- YOU WITH RESTRICTED MEDICATIONS AND POST TRAINING TESTING PRE TRAINING EXAMINATIONS AND A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE WORK HISTORY AND AND RACING HISTORY IT REALLY ALLOWS US TO GET A GOOD IDEA OF WHETHER THESE HORSES ARE APPROPRIATELY -- SET TO BE TRAINED. THE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS MENTIONED THE PT SCAN WE HOPE WILL BE. A GAME CHANGER FOR US THERE IS A SPECIFIC BONE ON THE BACK OF THE HORSES ANKLE. THAT THERE IS A A DEFECT THAT CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED BY ANY EXISTING. TECHNOLOGY AND THE P. E. T. SCAN WHICH THIS TRYING TO GROUP -- DONATED HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR ITS IT'S ACQUISITION. WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE. THOSE DEFICIENCIES ARE DEFECTS AND TRULY THE ONE THING THAT I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS POSITION -- IS. INNOVATION IS A BIG. THING TO THIS COMPANY THEY REALLY WANT TO FIND ANYTHING IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WILL MAKE HORSE RACING SAFER. THEY ARE INTERESTED IN IT THEY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT IT AND WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW. WHAT IF ANYTHING IS OUT THERE THAT CAN MAKE HORSE RACING SAFE THERE -- I DON'T I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE COMING FROM A NON PROFIT WHERE YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING NOT TO SPEND ANY MONEY IT'S REALLY EXCITING TO HAVE A COMPANY THAT IS REALLY ENTHUSED ABOUT THESE TYPES OF OF ADVANCES REALLY WILLING TO INVEST IN THE SPORT -- YEAH WE AREN'T -- WE ARE CONSTRAINED BY. ANY LIMITATIONS ON WHAT WILL MAKE COURSE RACING SAFER IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK MAY MAKE HORSE RACING SAFER. WHETHER IT BE LOOKING AT TRAINING PRACTICES I KNOW EARLIER SOMEONE MENTIONED THE NUMBER OF HIGH SPEED FOR A LONG AS OF COURSE DOES. WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT INFORMATION IN TRYING TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY THAT AS IN TRAINING WE CAN REGULATE THAT. OR NOT TAKE ENTRIES OF A HORSE HAS HAD TOO MANY HIGH SPEED FOR A LONG FOR HIS TRAIN TOO MUCH COMING UP TO A RACE OR WORK. SO REALLY WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO MAKE HORSE RACING SAFER. AND I HOPE YOU EVENTUALLY TO BE THE THE GOLD STANDARD FOR THE WORLD AND HAVE EVERYONE ASK WHAT CALIFORNIA'S DOING [inaudible] THANK YOU. HI MY NAME'S MIKE ROGERS -- PRESIDENT STRONGER GROUP I'VE BEEN AN EXECUTIVE WITH STRONG RECOUP FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS I SIT ON VARIOUS INDUSTRY BOARDS FOR THE BREEDERS CUP TO THE INJURY TO THE T. R. A.. WELCOME BASS I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS -- TO ADD I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND SUPPORT THESE TWO FANTASTIC. CENTER BRADFORD YES DOCTOR YOU MENTIONED A BONE BEHIND THE% ANKLE WAS THAT THE MOST COMMON BREAKDOWN IN THE GINGER'S THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR. SO I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE ACTUAL NAY CROSSES THAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR AND CERTAINLY I'VE NOT BEEN ON THE STRENGTH OF LONG ENOUGH. BUT FOR THE MAJORITY OF INJURIES THAT OCCUR IN HORSES ARE CENTER ON WHAT'S CALLED FAT LOCKER WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OTHERS THEIR INFO. AND THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE PLACE THAT WE CANNOT CURRENTLY DIAGNOSE ANY ISSUES SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW US. TO REMOVE THAT BLIND SPOT. FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER GREAT. CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND CERTAINLY. I WILL COMMAND THE STRATA GROUP. FOR GETTING OUT GRASS OF LEE -- TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF Là DESIST REMAINS THE ON WHAT THE SOLUTIONS MAY OR MAY NOT BE. AND WHERE THE QUESTIONS A BITE TO EAT ADDRESS TO THE VETERINARIAN. DR INTO THIS YOU KNOW. SON THERE'S CRITICISM OUT THERE THAT FOR EXAMPLE -- CHANGES TO THE USEFUL -- AND MY SIX DON'T MESS TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BREAKDOWN. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT CRITICISM [inaudible] SO. LASIX MAY NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH BREAKDOWN SPECIFICALLY FOR FRANKLY THE RESEARCH WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RESEARCH WOULD BE I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE IS EVER TAKEN A LONG TERM -- LOOK AT WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN ANY CHANGE IN THE BREEDING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH. THE ABILITY TO USE LASIX SO CERTAINLY THAT'S A QUESTION THAT I CAN'T ANSWER BUT I DO KNOW THAT BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES. ARE SIGNIFICANT PERCEPTION ISSUES FOR THE PUBLIC AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO COME TO RACING BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT. COURSES ARE WHIPS OR THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE MEDICATION TO COMPETE. THEN WE DON'T HAVE A PRODUCT IN WE NEED WE NEED TO BE DOING THE BEST THING NOT ONLY FOR THE HORSES BUT FOR THE SPORT. I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER AND SHE TO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF PERCEPTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT DOES LIVE THROUGH AN OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE THE STRONGER COOPER ANY OTHER -- YOU KNOW INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDER CAN IGNORE. IT'S A SPORT THERE ARE FANS AND YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE PUBLIC AND APPROPRIATE MANNER ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. BUT AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS A EDUCATION ROOTED IN SCIENCE. NOT ALL OF US HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE ALWAYS. DO A GOOD JOB OF ROUTING OUR DECISIONS IN SCIENCE AND DATA. AND IT'S CERTAINLY STRIKES ME AS ODD WE LOOK IN -- WE ARE WE LOOKING OTHER STATES AND WE ARE WITH THESE CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED IN YOU SEE -- FATALITIES DOWN YOU LOOK EVEN YOU KNOW WE HAD SOME DISCUSSION INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS RIGHT AND CERTAINLY AGAIN I APPLIED -- THE PURSUIT OF THE HIGHEST STANDARDS IN ANY. IN ANY CONCERTS -- BUT EVEN INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THERE ARE FATALITIES -- SO SOME OF THE STRIKES ME AND I'LL CONTRACTORS QUESTION OPEN AND LEADER WHOEVER MIGHT WANT TO TAKE IT -- HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION ISSUES THAT JUST FRANKLY DON'T REALLY LINE UP WITH IT AND WE'RE WE'RE YOU'LL FATALITIES ARE DOWN? AND YET WE'RE HAVING A HEARING HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS WHAT PEOPLE EARLY SOME OF THE PRESSURE OR OTHER PERCEPTION FOLKS MY AND COHEN A CRISIS -- AND AGAIN IF IF THE RESULT OF ALL THAT IS IS A CONTINUATION. OF THE GOLD STANDARD HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR PERHAPS MAKING IT THE PLATINUM STANDARD. THEN -- THAT'S A GOOD THING TO GET THE FOR THE INDUSTRY IT'S GOOD TO BE A SUPPORT GROUP OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WITH THAT YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU SEE THE PERCEPTION ISSUES GOING FORWARD -- HELLO DOCTOR BENSON TALK TO THE SCIENCE OF THE I'LL TALK TO THE PERCEPTION. SO -- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER OUR OUR INDUSTRY IS ONE THAT IS IN DECLINE. SO WE HAVE A REAL CHALLENGE HOW DO WE WANT TO GET THOSE NEW FANS NEW GUESTS ARE INDUSTRY -- THAT DEMOGRAPHIC THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO ATTRACT -- DOES NOT WISH TO SEE HORSES BEING DRUGGED. OR RUNNING ON MEDICATION. THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE HORSES RUNNING ON PAGE OR TRAINING ON PAIN MEDICATION. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE EXCESSIVE USE OF THE WEB FOR THE CROP. THOSE ARE THE VALUES THAT WE ALSO EMBRACE IF IF WE DON'T INCREASE THOSE VALUES. THERE WILL BE A CONTINUATION A CLIENT OF OUR BUSINESS -- IN OUR INDUSTRY SO BUT THOSE ARE ALSO VALUES THAT THAT WE DO EMBRACE BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT OF COURSE WELFARE -- AND WRITER WELFARE THAT IS AT THE CENTER OF OF WHAT WE DO [inaudible] SO -- YOU KNOW WE JUST HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IT WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ALSO -- THAT WE ADVOCATE FOR ADVOCATE FOR THE CHANGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT WE WE HAVE A UNIFORM PLATFORM IN NORTH AMERICA. I'M OFTEN ASKED WELL IF THEY CAN RUN IN IN EUROPE WITHOUT LASIX WHY CAN'T YOU. IF THEY CAN RUN THE DUBAI WORLD CUP. WITHOUT LASIX WHY CAN'T YOU. SO IT. PERHAPS SOME OF ITS PERCEPTION ISSUE. PERHAPS -- THE SCIENCE YOU KNOW THERE IS MIXED -- DEBATE AROUND THE SCIENCE DOES IT CONTRIBUTE. TO CATASTROPHIC INJURY INJURIES OR DOES IT CONTRIBUTE TO A A WEAKENING OF THE THOROUGHBRED -- FREE -- THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S A QUESTION FOR SCIENCE BUT FROM A PERCEPTION STANDPOINT FROM THE NEW GUESTS THAT WE WISH TO ATTRACT. WE HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE VALUES [inaudible] SEVEN REVIEW. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN I JUST HAVE A A FOLLOW UP -- TO WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GREGIS AUS OUT THE PERCEPTION PIECE IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU ARE DOING TO BE PROACTIVE IN TERMS OF MESSAGING BECAUSE CLEAR YES HE WAS STATING -- YOU KNOW THE MEDIAN WE'VE ALL HEARD AT THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING JUST AS IN TERMS OF OF ALL THE EFFORT SAY YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT. THAT FORWARD TO MAKE THINGS BETTER IS THERE ANY PLAN IS THERE. SOME KIND OF OUTREACH THAT YOU PLANTED TO IN TERMS OF CHANGING PERCEPTION. WELL I THINK THE YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THE ACTIONS WE TAKE THE REAL ACTIONS THAT THE REFORMS THE CHANGE. WILL HELP TO CHANGE PERCEPTIONS THIS ISN'T A PR STUNT WE'RE NOT DOING THIS FOR FOR GOOD PR WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THOSE MEETING FULL CONCRETE REFORMS THAT WE COULDN'T PLAY PUT CAN PUT IN PLACE. THE TRULY AFFECT THE OUTCOME -- AT THE END OF THE DAY AND THEN. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US IN THE INDUSTRY TO ADVOCATE THE POSITIVES THAT OUR INDUSTRY -- AND OUR SPORT DOES BRING. AND WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW -- JOBS THE LOVE OF HORSES THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT WORK IN OUR INDUSTRY. AND THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE ARE MAKING CONCRETE IMPROVEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO HORSE WELFARE AND WRITER WELFARE. THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE HAVE TO COLLECTIVELY KEEP. KEEP -- KEEP TALKING ABOUT. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT AS A PUPPY SPLIT THIS EAST ON BECAUSE CLEARLY -- SOME HORSES HALF HAVE DIED BUT IN THE REASON I SAY THAT BECAUSE IT IS MY DISTRICT. NAKED CALLS ALL THE TIME ABOUT THE NUMBERS OF COURSE IS THAT DIED IN IT'S NOT ACCURATE I DON'T KNOW HOW. TO ACCURATELY DEFENDED -- AND I'M NOT TRYING TO I'M TRYING TO JUST MAKE SURE TO BE HONEST YOU KNOW BUT MY POINT IS THAT. THE MESSAGE KEEPS GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER BY THAI PEOPLE HEAR IT AND AND I KNOW IT'S JUST A SUGGESTION BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF THERE'S INFORMATION TO BE CLARIFIED. IT IS WOULD BE HELPFUL SO PEOPLE DON'T BLOW THINGS OUT OF PROPORTION SO BUT YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A LITTLE WORK TO DO. THANK YOU -- BUT YOU SAW THE FINAL QUESTION YOU KNOW. OR I'LL START WITH THE STATE AND THEN JUST HAVE YOU COMMENT ON IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS TO HAVE BETTER METRICS. I MEAN WE'VE HAD THIS SAY THERE'S TWENTY SIXTH. TWENTY FIVE YES THIS YEAR BUT THEN WE HEAR. ABOUT HOW WAR AT THE LOWEST POINT THAT WE'VE BEEN A LONG TIME IN THE INDUSTRY AND YOU KNOW THOSE. TWO IMPORTANT -- DATA SETS ARE CONFLICTING IT'S SO WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE -- THAT ARE -- YOU KNOW AND NOT AS UP ON IT AS YOU ALL ARE -- THEN YOU GET THESE PERCEPTIONS. IS SO PERCEPTIONS ASIDE WE STILL AT TWENTY FIVE ANIMALS DIED THIS YEAR. AND I THINK THE INDUSTRY SHOULD COME UP WITH. SOME METRICS SO THAT -- NOT THAT THERE -- IT'S NOT LIKE PUTTING LIPSTICK ON A PIG IF YOU WILL IT'S REALLY HARD CORE THESE ARE HOW MANY RUNS A WE HAVE THIS. IT IN IN MAYBE CITING SOME STATISTICS -- YOU OFFER A LOT FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME OR YOU KNOW SOME POINT IN TIME THIS JUST MAY BE -- AN ABERRATION I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. FIFTY CREATURE SURE -- THERE IS A A DATABASE THAT RACE TRACKS ARE INVITED TO USE IN THAT ALL OF THE STRONG A GROUP TRACKS TO USE IT'S CALLED THE EQUINE ENTRY DATABASE THAT TRACKS THE NUMBER OF INJURIES. OVER TIME FOR HORSES AND WHEN I STARTED IN THIS INDUSTRY SEVEN EIGHT YEARS AGO. TOO WEIRD TWO PER THOUSAND CATASTROPHIC INJURIES -- PER THOUSAND INSTANCES OF RACING. WE ARE NOW DOWN AS AN INDUSTRY ABOUT ONE POINT. EIGHT L.. THAT IS CERTAINLY A GREAT IMPROVEMENT AND BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE FEELS THAT WERE DONE AND YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES AND THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER -- I DON'T THINK WE EVEN NEED TO SHOOT FOR WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO I THINK OUR GOAL IS -- ZERO PER THOUSAND WE MAY NEVER GET THERE BUT I THINK WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS THAT -- YOU KNOW AND AND THAT IS ULTIMATELY THE GOAL. I ALSO THINK THAT IF YOU -- LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. SINCE. THE REFORMS HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN. WERE AT 2% IN THOUSAND OR TWO PER EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED ACTUALLY WHEN YOU INCLUDE RACING SO THAT'S CERTAINLY AN IMPROVEMENT FROM WHERE WE HAVE BEEN AND WE CONTINUE. TO HOPE THAT TREND CONTINUES. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS ZERO NO MATTER WHAT WE'RE DOING WHAT NUMBER WERE AT AT THE TIME. LET'S IN LESS SOMEBODY HAS SOMETHING ELSE LET'S AND ON THAT NOTE I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU COMING HERE TODAY AND AND GIVING US YOUR VALUABLE. WHAT'S GOING ON AND YET. WITH STROLLER GROUP IN PARTICULAR THANK YOU. NOW THE NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE WHAT ALEX WALDRON PRESIDENT CEO. NATIONAL THOROUGHBRED RACING ASSOCIATION. IT CHAIR RACING -- MEDICATION AND TESTING CONSORTIUM AND CRAIG -- SORRY CAN'T READ HERE. BROUGH -- PRESIDENT CEO OF THE BREEDERS CUP LIMITED. WELCOME [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CREATE THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU. ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THESE COMMITTEES FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC OF HORSE RACING SAFETY -- IS A CONCERN WHICH IS UNDOUBTEDLY FUNDAMENTAL TO THE FUTURE OF COURSE RACING NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA. BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I AM ALEX WALDER PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE NATIONAL THOROUGHBRED RACING ASSOCIATION AND ALSO CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE RACING MEDICATION AND TESTING CONSORTIUM -- WHAT WE CALL THE RTC? I'M BEFORE YOU TODAY REPRESENTING TWO NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE AT THE HEART OF THE U. S. RACING INDUSTRIES EXTENSIVE. AND ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENHANCE THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF HORSE RACING'S EC WINE AND HUMAN ATHLETES. I'LL BEGIN BY DISCUSSING THE RTC. THE RTC CONSIST OF TWENTY THREE RACING INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDER ORGANIZATIONS. THAT REPRESENT MULTIPLE READS OF RACING -- FOR MOST FOR MORE THAN TWO DAYS TO TECH FOR ALMOST TWO DECADES OF THE R. M. T. C. HAS ENSURE THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF RESOURCES. BY DEVELOPING AND PROMOTING SCIENCE BASED UNIFORMITY CATION REGULATIONS. ESTABLISHING CONSISTENT HIGH QUALITY DRUGS TESTING STANDARDS. COORDINATING AND FUNDING ILLICIT SUBSTANCE RESEARCH. AND GENERATING EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES THAT ENSURE THE SAFETY OF RACE. AND PARTICIPANTS. CALIFORNIA STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE C. H. R. B. ARE AMONG THE MOST ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS AND FUNDERS OF THE RTC. OOPS ON MORE. THE RTC PROVIDES CRITICAL SUPPORT TO REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ACROSS THE US INCLUDING THE C. H. ARMY. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHAT WE CALL OUR NATIONAL UNIFORMITY CATION PROGRAM -- THIS ARE ANTI SAID THE CEDAR FELT MEDICATION REFORM INITIATIVE IS NOW PART OF THE NATIONAL MODEL RULES OF RACING. ADOPTED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF RACING COMMISSIONERS INTERNATIONAL ARE WE WE CALL THE R. C. I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR ALL THE ACRONYMS -- THE NATIONAL UNIFORMITY CATION PROGRAM CREATES A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND PROVIDE UNIFORMLY GALATIANS ACROSS ALL COMPLIANCE STATES -- THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES A LIST OF PERMITTED THERAPEUTIC MEDICATIONS INCLUDING TESTING% LIMITS AND RECOMMENDED MEDICATION WITHDRAWAL TIMES KNOWN AS THE CONTROLLED THERAPEUTIC. SUBSTANCES LIST. THE PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDES RIGOROUS CONTROLS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF FUROSEMIDE ALSO KNOWN AS LASIX. THEREBY REMOVING PRIVATE VETERINARY ACCESS TO OUR HORSES ON RACE DAY. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES A NATIONAL MULTIPLE MEDICATION VIOLATION PENALTY SYSTEM TO ENHANCE PUBLIC PALACE MEANT FOR HORSE TRAINERS WITH INCREASING MEDICATION ABOUT LIKE VIOLATIONS REGARDLESS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE OFFENSE OCCURRED. THE FOURTH COMPONENT OF THE NATIONAL PROGRAM IS THE ARM TC'S LABORATORY ACCREDITATION AND EXTERNAL QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. THE RTC ACCREDITS LABORATORIES THAT DEMONSTRATE CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE DETECTION FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF SUBSTANCES AT LOW CONCENTRATIONS -- THE NINE OR MTC ACCREDITED LABORATORIES WHICH INCLUDE THE UC DAVIS MADDY LAM. NOW PROVIDE TESTING FOR OF SAMPLES FOR THIRTY TWO OF THIRTY FOUR PARA MUTUAL RACING JURISDICTIONS. RECENTLY THE AREN'T YOU SEE ALSO DEVELOPED AN EXPANSIVE OUT OF COMPETITION TESTING PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES. A CORRESPONDING PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES LIST. THIS OUT OF COMPETITION TESTING PROGRAM IS AS COMPREHENSIVE AS ANY IN THE WORLD AND HAS BEEN FULLY AND AGGRESSIVELY IMPLEMENTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA BY THE C. H. R. B.. CALIFORNIA HAS FULLY ADOPTED THE NATIONAL UNIFORM PROGRAM. WITH THE EXCEPTION. OF THE MEDICAL MULTIPLE MEDICATION VALID VIOLATION PENALTY SYSTEM. WHICH IS UNDER REVIEW BY YOU THE LEGISLATIVE TEAM -- FOR THE C. H. R. B.. CURRENTLY -- THE RTC. IMPROVES DETECTION OF ILLICIT OR PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES THROUGH OUR TACTICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM -- THE RAPID TEST DEVELOPMENT PROVIDED BY THE THE TACTICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM IS CRUCIAL TO A RADIC HEADING PERSISTENT CHEATERS. IDENTIFYING UNKNOWN SUBSTANCES FOR REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND REGULATED RACETRACK OPERATORS. AND COLLABORATING WITH LABORATORIES TO TACKLE BLOOD DOPING IN AN HOUR ANABOLIC AGENTS -- THAT ARE PROVEN ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY REGULATION OF THE SPORT. THE LIST OF OUR MTC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN NEW YORK A. R. C. I. MODEL RULES JUST IN THE FIGHT LAST FIVE YEARS IS TO LINK THE YOU CAN SEE AN COMPLICATED TO MENTION. BUT THE WORK GOES ON AND I WILL NOTE THE CALIFORNIA HAS ADOPTED OR IS IN THE PROCESS OF ADOPTING ALL OF OUR R. M. T. C. RECOMMENDED NATIONAL MODEL RULES. THE LIST THE LIST OF CALIFORNIA TRACKS AND ASSOCIATIONS THAT SUPPORT AND PARTICIPATE IN THE ARE IN DC IS LINKING. AND GIVEN THE COMMITMENT. OF THE RTC TO A SAFER RACING ENVIRONMENT -- THE RTC WILL STRONGLY CONSIDER RECOMMENDING CALIFORNIA'S ENHANCED CORTICOSTEROID IN ANTI INFLAMMATORY POLICIES. TO BE INCLUDED IN THE NATIONAL UNIFORMITY CATION PROGRAM AND PERHAPS AS MODEL RULES. SO NEXT NOW FOCUS MY EFFORTS ON THE N. T. R. A. AND ITS SAFETY AND INTEGRITY ON ITS. AS PART OF OUR MISSION TO PURSUE CONSENSUS DRIVEN SOLUTIONS TO INDUSTRY PROBLEMS. THE INTERIOR CREE THE INTERIOR A SAFETY IN INTEGRITY ALLIANCE WHOSE FUNCTION IT IS TO IMPLEMENT. NUMEROUS PROVED PROVEN SAFETY INITIATIVES ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS INCLUDING THE NATIONAL UNIFORM MEDICATION PROGRAM. THE FUNDAMENTAL FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ALLIANCE IS THE CONVICTION THAT. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR HUMAN AND NECKLINE ATHLETES IN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SPORT OUR HORSE RACING'S TOP PRIORITIES. WE FORMED THE ALLIANCE AS A CATALYST FOR CHANGE AFTER A BILL SUFFERED CATASTROPHIC INJURIES AND WAS EUTHANIZED ON TRACK AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT KENTUCKY DERBY. AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TRIPLE CROWN THE END TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OF GRAND HOPEFUL BIG BROWN. WAS REVEALED TO BE LEGALLY RECEIVING REGULAR CYCLES OF ANABOLIC STEROIDS. SUDDENLY HORSE RACING FOUND ITSELF ON THE FRONT PAGE OF NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS AND FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS. IN ADDITION CONGRESS WAS ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS THERE INDUSTRY WAS HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME ANSWERING. RACING UNDERSTOOD THEN AS IT DOES NOW THAT A LOT CAN BE LOST IF WE FAIL TO ASSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR HORSES AND RIDERS. AND THE INTEGRITY OF OUR COMPETITION. SO BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINE THE SAFETY IN INTEGRITY ALLIANCE. ALONG WITH A HOST OF OTHER INDUSTRY. INITIATIVES WAS IN FULL GEAR DEMONSTRATING THAT BY WORKING TOGETHER. GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS CAN REFORM THE INDUSTRY. THE ALLIANCE'S PURPOSES PURPOSE IS TO ESTABLISH AN SECURE IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL STANDARDS TO PROMOTE SAFETY IN INTEGRITY. THROUGH AN IT HERE IT'S TO IT ALLIANCE CODE OF STANDARDS -- THE ALLIANCE IMPLEMENTS AND ENFORCES THESE STANDARDS EMBODIED IN THE CODE TO A COMPREHENSIVE ACCREDITATION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. TO BE CREDITED A RACETRACK MUST DEMONSTRATE IN WRITING AND BY PASSING A RIGOROUS ONSITE INSPECTION. IT HAS IT HAS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ALL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ALLIANCE GO TO STANDARDS. AND THOSE THAT CODE COVER SIX BROAD AREAS. INTO REPORTING AND PREVENTION. A SAFER RACING AND TRAINING AND WALDRON WE WE CAN READ THAT OKAY JUST YOU CAN SEE THAT. SO COLLEGE EYES SO TIME DOESN'T PERMIT ME TO GO INTO A DEEPER PRESENTATION OF THE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE PAGE BECAUSE STANDARDS. YES. SO I CAN JUST POINT YOU TO W. W. W. THAT INTERIOR ALLIANCE DOT COM -- I WILL SAY THAT THE CO STANDARDS IS AN EVOLVING DOCUMENT ITS UPDATED CONTINUOUSLY AND MODIFIED BASED UPON THESE FOR STANDARDS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE PUBLIC SUBMISSIONS. OBSERVE BEST PRACTICES AND THE MODEL RULES AS THEY CHANGE -- WE HAVE AN ADVISORY BOARD -- THAT'S CONSISTING OF MANY OF OUR INDUSTRIES KEY STAKEHOLDER GROUPS THAT REVIEW AND REVISE THE CODE OF STANDARDS AT LEAST ONCE ANNUALLY. BY UPDATING THE CODE CONST CONSTANTLY AND BY HEARING TO A BIENNIAL RE ACCREDITATION CYCLE WE MAKE SURE THAT PARTICIPATING TRACKS. ARE CONSTANTLY AND CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING. RIGHT NOW THERE TWENTY FOUR CREDITED RACETRACKS ACQUIRE ACCOUNTING 490% A GRADED STAKES. OF STAKES RACES IN 75% OF NORTH AMERICAN WAGERING. HERE ON CALIFORNIA'S ACCREDITED TRACKS AND IT NEEDED DEL MAR GOLDEN GATE FIELDS. AND ALSO METERS. AND YOU CAN SHARE IT READY SURE REST ASSURE THAT THE ALLIANCE IS ALREADY AT WORK ANALYZING THE CHANGES RECENTLY EMIT IMPLEMENTED BY THE STRONG TO GROUPS CALIFORNIA TRACKS. AND SOON TO BE ADOPTED BY DEL MAR. THESE CHANGES THE TERM -- IF THEY'RE DETERMINED TO BE BENEFICIAL TO THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE HORSE THEY WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME PART OF OUR CODE OF STANDARDS -- REFORMS IMPLEMENTED BY THE SAFE MATERIALIZE THE ARE IN DC AND OTHER LIKE MINDED ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE C. H. R. B. HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A 16% DECLINE IN EC ONE FATALITIES. NATIONALLY THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE LIKEWISE EVEN WITH THE RECENT SPATE OF FATALITIES AT SENATE NIDA CALIFORNIA IS ON TRACK TO RECORD ITS SECOND THE SECOND FUSE FATALITIES. SUCH BECAME CHANGE BEGIN RECORDING THOSE IN -- NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE PROGRESS BOTH NATIONALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA IS UNDENIABLE. BUT WE CAN AND WE MUST DO EVERYTHING EVEN MORE TO PROTECT THE HORSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANKS MISS WALDRON VERY IMPRESSIVE -- THE NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS CRAIG FOR EVIL AND THE CHAIRMAN OF AND I'M THE PRESIDENT CEO THE BREEDERS CUP. FORMALLY PRESIDENT GENERAL MANAGER OF THE DEL MAR THOROUGHBRED CLUB -- AND SO I GO BACK A LONG WAY IN CALIFORNIA RACING I'M. HERE TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU THAT THE LACK OF PREPARED COMMENTS IS A GREAT ASSISTANCE AND BREVITY SO. I WILL -- WITHHOLD ANY FORMAL COMMENTS AND SIMPLY STATE -- HOW IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA RACING IS AND I'M HERE PRIMARILY TODAY -- AS ERIC REQUESTED ME TO DO TO TO TESTIFY. THE IMPORTANCE OF CALIFORNIA RACING TO THE NATIONAL RACING ENVIRONMENT. AND AS A A GREAT THE HOST SITE FOR THE BREEDERS CUP -- WE HAVE HELD THE BREEDERS CUP NINE TIMES AT SENATOR WERE SCHEDULED TO HOLD THE BREEDERS CUP AGAIN THERE -- IN EARLY NOVEMBER THE FIRST WEEKEND IN NOVEMBER -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE HELD THE BREEDERS CUP AT DEL MAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ROUTINELY AMONGST OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL HIGHLY -- ANTICIPATED AND ENJOYABLE BREEDERS CUPS -- PARTLY THANKS TO THE GREAT MANAGEMENT TEAMS AND HORSEMEN -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO TO THE STUPENDOUS WHETHER BOTH IN ARCADIA -- AND AND DEL MAR -- AYE IN ADDITION TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA IS TO US NOT JUST OF THE BREEDERS CUP INTO THE BREEDING INDUSTRY -- IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU WHAT A GREAT EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA SAID OVER THE YEARS AND I AS I SAID I STARTED WORKING IN THE RACING INDUSTRY IN. NINETEEN NINETY MY FIRST JOB WAS AT DEL MAR WHICH I'D LOVE TO TAKE THE BREEDERS CUP IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN OVER THAT TIME SPAN. I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE HOW MANY NEW INITIATIVES WERE BEGUN HERE IN CALIFORNIA FROM THE FIRST EQUINE MEDICAL DIRECTOR THAT SENATOR. MADDY CONJURED UP -- IN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. TO THE NECROPSY PROGRAM TO THE MADDIE LABORATORY AT UC DAVIS. TO SAFETY RAILS BEING THE FIRST ASSAULT AROUND THE COUNTRY I COULD GO ON AND ON BUT CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN FIRST. AND ONCE AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY OUR FIRST ON THE BED OF A POINT OF THE SPEAR HERE BECAUSE OF THAT A RECENT UNFORTUNATE SERIES OF EVENTS BUT YOU'VE ALSO. SHOWN A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR HOW TO REACT TO THAT KIND OF SITUATION HOW TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS DOES NOT RELAX. TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE VIGILANCE WE ALL NEED TO BE MORE AND MORE CAREFUL ABOUT AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE -- PEOPLE SAY WHAT CAN WE DO I THINK NATIONALLY A LOT OF THE REFORMS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED HERE. NEED TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO IMPLEMENT THOSE MORE EFFECTIVELY MOREQUICKLY -- AND AND MORE UNIVERSALLY SO THAT CALIFORNIA'S AND SITTING ON AN ISLAND BY ITSELF SO -- I COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR WORK -- THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD HAS BEEN A GREAT PARTNER TO THE BREEDERS CUP WE HAVE DONE. ALL KINDS OF NEW INITIATIVES WITH THEM FROM -- ERADICATING LASIX FROM TWO YEAR OLD RACES IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND THIRTEEN DURING THE BREEDERS CUP -- TO OTHER FORMS OF OUT OF COMPETITION TESTING THAT BEEN DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH DR ARTHUR IN THE MEDICAL TEAM -- AND MANY MANY MORE -- THAT HAVE SET GREAT EXAMPLES FOR SAFETY AND INTEGRITY AROUND THE INDUSTRY AND WE'RE PROUD TO BE A PART OF IT THANK YOU QUESTIONS. I'VE GOT -- ONE I I I MENTIONED THIS EARLIER AND I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE PERHAPS -- THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE STATS HERE CALIFORNIA COMPARED -- TO YOU OVERSEAS IN TERMS OF COURSE YEAH DOUBTS IN AGAIN. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC METRICS EXCEPT. FOR YEAH WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS YEAR SO FAR CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT ANY THOUGHT YOU HAVE ON THAT [inaudible] WELL THE I THINK IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE WE'RE COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES -- AND THAT'S AND I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION WHEN WHEN WE SAY. BUT WE DO ABOUT THE U. S. VERSUS -- OF EUROPEAN OR INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS -- WE WE IN THIS COUNTRY I HAVE A ONE METRIC I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT HAPPENS -- IN EUROPE -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT MEMBER THEY RAISE PRIMARILY ON ON GRASS -- AND SYNTHETIC WHERE AS WE RACE ON DIRT THAT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE ENTIRELY -- THOSE THINGS AFFECT THOSE NUMBERS AS WELL -- BUT ANYWAY YOU SLICE IT THE THE US NEEDS TO IMPROVE ON OUR A FATALITY RATE -- NATIONWIDE AND AND IT LETTER EVERY LEVEL -- WE NEED TO BE BELOW EUROPE -- WERE EVERY TIAS -- BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND AMERICAN PUBLIC WANTS THAT -- THAT'S NOT ONLY TRUE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THAT'S TRUE ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- AND SO WE WANTED TO MEET AND EXCEED YOUR AND AND IT'S IT'S IT'S STANDARD -- THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO SHOOT FOR BUT WE'VE MADE PROGRESS AND I'M PROUD TO SAY WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND AND WITH THESE NEW REFORMS. THAT HAVE COME ALONG IN CALIFORNIA MAYBE WE CAN MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS WELL AND I'M EXCITED TO DIG INTO. TO THE THE THINGS YOU'VE DONE HERE ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE DONE HERE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN. IMPLEMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- TO TO BRING FATALITIES DOWN IN OTHER IN OTHER STATES. AND YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED AS APOLOGIZE IF I MISSED YOU YOU MENTIONED. THE UNITED STATES VERSUS EUROPEAN AND OTHER. FOREIGNERS BUT WHAT ABOUT WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME STATES. ARE ALLOWING US YOU KNOW. SOME THINGS THAT OTHER STATES DON'T DESERVE. WHAT'S THE UNIFORMITY LOOK LIKE AMONG THE STATES IN IN AMERICA. WELL -- IT COULD BE BETTER -- WE HAVE WE HAVE THE THE MID ATLANTIC THE THERE ARE I THINK ELEVEN STATES FROM NEW YORK -- DOWN THROUGH VIRGINIA THAT WORK TOGETHER AND THEY'RE VERY CLOSE IN IN PROXIMITY SO THEY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF UNIFORMITY IN IN THAT AREA -- BEYOND THAT THERE AND THERE'S NO ONE REGION -- THE NATIONAL UNIFORMITY CATION PROGRAM. HAS SUBSTANTIAL UNIFORMITY BUT IT NEEDS TO BE ADOPTED IN CERTAIN MAJOR STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA WE SAID TO MAKE TO HAVE PERFECT. UNIFORMITY SO THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE THERE IS NO QUESTION WE NEED TO ACT FASTER AND WE NEED TO GET THAT DONE THE HORSES ARE TRAVELING AROUND THE COUNTRY THEY'RE GOING TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT REGIONS TO RACE IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S TRUE. SO IS THERE A NATIONAL ASSOCIATION THAT'S LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES TO TRY TO GET IT UNIFORM WELL THAT'S WHAT THE RTC IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT THE ALLIANCE DO TOGETHER THEY WORK HAND IN GLOVE. TO ESTABLISH THE UNIFORM PROGRAM AND TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM AND AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT THOSE TWO ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON NOT EXCLUSIVELY BUT THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHAT THEY DO -- AND SO IT'S UP TO TO US IF YOU WILL TO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND THEN YOU YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THERE'S A UNITED STATES IS MOSTLY DIRT EUROPE IS MOSTLY. GRASS AND ARTIFICIAL TURF IS OUR ARTIFICIAL. YEAH THERE ARE ARTIFICIAL SERVICES OR WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE WHO REJECT -- THE SOULS WITH AMONGST THE DIFFERENT REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES IS THERE ARE DIFFERENT ARE THE THE IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN THE DIRT OR IS IT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS WELL I'M GONNA I'M GONNA DEFERRED TO SERVER THE OTHER SERVICES AS GENERALLY ON THE HOW pUNIFORMITY. WELL I THINK I THINK I'M GOING TO DEFER TO DOCTOR PETERSON WHO'S GOING TO BE UP NEXT HE WILL TELL YOU THAT SERVICES AND AND HE WILL I THINK IS THE OF THE THE RESIDENT EXPERT AND HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT HOW. A GOOD DIRT TRACK COULD BE AS SAFE AS A AS A SYNTHETIC TRACK BUT SO HE'LL HE'LL EXPLAIN THAT LATER BUT THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE -- I IT'S GOT TO BE REALLY QUICK BECAUSE I WANT TO GET THE NEXT ONE UP CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE PROCESS THE BREEDERS CUP IS IMPLEMENTED FOR TRAINERS. WHO'VE BEEN SANCTIONED FOR MEDICAL VIOLATION OF A SPECIFIC CATEGORY BY RACING. REGULATORY AGENCY OVER ONE YEAR DURATION. AND IT HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE I THINK I THINK YOU JUST DESCRIBED A IF IF TRAINERS HAVE. CERTAIN TYPES OF OF CLASS -- ONE VIOLATIONS I BELIEVE CLASS -- TO WITHOUT SOME PARTICULAR PERIOD OF TIME PRIOR TO THE BREEDERS CUP -- THEY'RE PRECLUDED FROM ENTERING SO WE WE WE MAINTAIN COMPLETE DISCRETION OVER THE ENTRY FORCES IN THE BREEDERS CUP ENOUGH. F. TRAINERS OR OWNERS ARE OTHERS DON'T MEET THE STANDARDS THEN WE JUST DON'T LET THEM RACE AMERICA. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. AND FOR EVERYBODY YOU KNOW I KNOW THIS TIME THE TIMING IS -- IT IS WORTH NOTING THOUGH DO WE WERE AN HOUR LATE BECAUSE THE ASSEMBLY WAS STILL GOING. IN WE HAVE A SENATOR LEFT. SO -- NEXT PANEL. IN THIS OF THE STAFF. ASSEMBLY STAFF DEDICATED LOYAL GO AHEAD. HELLO MY NAME IS MICHAEL PETERSON MAKE I GO BY -- THINK HAD SLIDES UP HERE I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET TO HIM [inaudible] OF ALL RIGHT. UP. SO -- I AM A I AM DIRECTOR BAGGY QUINN PROGRAMS THAT -- UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY AND I AM OF PROFESSOR AND BY ASSISTANCE AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING -- MY EXPERTISE TO SEE AN OF RACING SURFACES. OF WHAT I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY IS THE EFFORTS THEY'VE BEEN MADE TO IMPROVE RACING SERVICES -- ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND CALIFORNIA'S BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THESE EFFORTS. OF WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WE REFER TO THE MAINTENANCE QUALITY SYSTEM THAT'S IMPLEMENTED A DOZEN OF THE TOP TRACKS IN THE UNITED STATES. OF THOSE THAT INCLUDES DEL MAR AND SANTA ANITA. IT'S A THREE PHASE PROCESS THAT WE USE WERE. SAMPLES ARE TAKEN FROM THE RACETRACK SURFACE AND ARE UTILIZED AND ARE TESTED AT OUR FACILITIES IN LEXINGTON KENTUCKY THERE'S A SERIES OF TWELVE TESTS TO VERIFY THE COMPOSITION OF THE MATERIAL. THOSE TESTS THROUGH THEN DONE% FROM SEVEN LOCATIONS ON THE TRACK IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE CONSISTENCY -- SPATIALLY ON THE TRACK THAT'S DONE BEFORE EVERY RACE MEET IN THE CASE OF A LONG RACE MEET LIKE SANTA NEEDED STUNT SEASONALLY DURING -- IT'S DONE BEFORE THE WINTER SEASON STARTS AND BEFORE THE SUMMER SEASON BECAUSE THERE'S TYPICALLY SOME BIG CHANGES AT THAT POINT -- THEN PRIOR TO EACH RACE MEET WE HAVE A CERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT WE GO THROUGH THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH -- WHAT'S DONE IN A LOT OF OTHER SPORTS SOCCER -- RUGBY AMERICAN FOOTBALL DOES NOT TO IT OF WHERE WE USE A BIOMECHANICAL SURFACE TESTER THAT'S BECOME AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD THAT WAS ALSO DEVELOPED USING -- HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I WAS IN MAINE AND COLORADO WHILE WE WERE DEVELOPING IT THERE WAS CALIFORNIA THAT LED THAT EFFORT. OF WE ALSO USE GROUND PENETRATING RADAR TO VERIFY THE SURFACE BEFORE EACH RACE MEET -- THAT'S IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH GROUND PENETRATING RADAR THAT'S LIKE IF YOU WATCH THE FORENSIC TV SHOWS WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE BODY THAT'S THE SAME TECHNOLOGY WE USE THAT TO VERIFY. THE SUBSURFACE OF THE TRACK. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THEN IS THAT SHOWS THAT THE SURFACE OF THAT SHOWS THAT THE SERVICE IS APPLICABLES CANDIES CAN BE SAFELY AND SAFE THING CONSISTENTLY USE SO IN PARTICULAR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY'RE SWITCHING FROM SANTA NEEDED TO DEL MAR -- THAT THE SURFACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HORSES HAVE A SIMILAR SERVICE TO RACE ON AT DEL MAR THE AS THEY DID ITS AND THE NEED. TO WE THEN HAVE A PROTOCOL THAT USE DAILY FOR DOCUMENTATION OF THE RACING SURFACE MAINTENANCE. A WEATHER STATION THE LOGS THE DATED EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTE INTERVAL MOISTURE CONTENT MEASUREMENTS TO MAKE AND ARE TAKEN EVERY DAY -- PRIOR TO RACING AND ALSO DOWNLOADED TO A RELATIONAL DATABASE. OUR GOAL IN THIS IS TO TREAT A RACE TRACK LIKE YOU WOULD A AN AIRPLANE WE EVERYBODY SAT ON THE TARMAC WILL BE PREPARED THE RARE AIRPLANE TO GET READY TO GO WHERE THERE'S A CHECKLIST. IT NEEDS TO BE CERTIFIED ALL THE MAINTENANCE IS DONE. AND THEN THE MAINTENANCE IS CERTIFIED BY A SECOND PERSON WHO DOES A CHECKLIST. OUR INTENT IS. TO CREATE A SAFETY CRITICAL SERVICE. WHICH THE RACING SERVICES IS SAFETY CRITICAL. PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT USED EVERY DAY WE'RE RISKING BOTH RIDERS AND HORSES ON THOSE SERVICES. AND SO IT NEEDS THE SAME STANDARDS OF CARE THAT WE THAT WE WOULD PUT INTO A AIRPLANE BEFORE WE BEFORE WE LET. PASSENGERS FLYING ON IT SO -- I WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR QUESTIONS WE'VE GOT TO IMPROVE WE'RE AT WE'RE WHERE WE ARE -- AND WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE AT THIS POINT BUT THIS IS RACING SERVICES NEED TO IMPROVE AND WE NEED TO GO FORWARD THEM OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TO FLY OUT HERE FROM KENTUCKY I DID AND WITH A REALLY NICE SEVEN SEVEN POWER POINT SLIDES THAT WITH NICE PICTURES AND EVERYTHING. BUT IT'S ALL OVER ALL TAKE THE CLIP LOCAL BACK TO MY OFFICE -- MAKE SURE YOU GET OF EVEN THE NO I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I GUESS I I GUESS BECAUSE IT'S FORGET. DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE CALIFORNIA YOU'RE AN EXPERT AT THE AT RACE TRACKS -- YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF I MISSED IN YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED OUT HERE PARTICULARLY AT THE THE OTHER ONE RACE TRACK AND SEE IF YOU'VE GOT ANY COMMENTS -- YEAH RELATIVE TO THAT WELL WHAT THE WEATHER IS UNUSUAL THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT I MEAN WE TO DO THE PEOPLE MENTIONED OTHER THIRTEEN INCHES OF RAIN OUR ON SITE WEATHER GAGE HAD SEVENTEEN INCHES OF RAIN OVER THAT'S OVER THAT -- OVER THAT TWO MONTH PERIOD I MEAN YOU WE SEE THAT A LOT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. BUT THE CHALLENGES THIS IS ALSO RACING SURFACE IT HAS TO BE USED -- DURING YOUR DRY HOT SUMMERS IN ARCADIA SO THE CHALLENGES TO PUT TOGETHER SURFACED THAT'S WILLING TO THE TABLE TO HANDLE THAT SEVENTEEN INCHES OF RAIN AND ALSO HANDLE HANDLE THE DRY PERIOD -- THAT SAID. OKAY I I'LL AND SINCE I DON'T HAVE MY SLIDE SO -- ALL USING ENGINEERING ANALOGY FOR YOU HERE AND I I I I I USE A SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN MAX -- BOEING AS AS THE EXAMPLE AND I I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN THAT SERIOUSLY BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS A SERIES OF THINGS THAT HAD TO GO WRONG YOU KNOW YOU HAD TO HAVE. THE DESIGN OF THE PLANE. THE ANGLE OF ATTACK SENSORS THE LACK OF GAUGES AND THE LACK OF TRAINING. AND WE HAVE TO APPROACH THIS THE SAME WAY BOEING'S APPROACHING THEIR PLAY. WE CAN'T FIX ONE THING AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HANDLE THAT WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE HAD WE SHOULD HAVE HAD PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT COULD HANDLE THE WEATHER AND WE DIDN'T AND THE CHALLENGE AND THE NICE THING IS IN THE THOROUGHBRED DAILY NEWS BOB BAFFERT EVEN SAID. THE SAME THING YOU GOT FROM THE ENGINEERS SO I THINK THAT GIVES IT SOME WHITE THE CHALLENGES WHEN IT BEGINS TO DRY OUT. AND IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND SAID I NEED IS ONE OF MOST DIFFICULT TRACKS TO MAINTAIN YOU CAN START OUT THE RACE CARD WITH IT -- FLOATED AND WET. AND IF YOU HAVE A HOT DRY WIND COMING OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS. BY THE BY THE FIFTH OR SIXTH RACE YOU MAY BE THINKING ABOUT GETTING THE WATER TRUCKS OUT. THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT -- SITUATION FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO BRING TECHNOLOGY TO BEAR ON THIS TO HELP SUPPORT THE SUPERINTENDENT'S ON THOSE DECISIONS MAKING THOSE DECISIONS AND AND AND THIS IS WHERE? OF OF WHAT -- BELINDA STRONACH WAS TALKING ABOUT IS IS IS KEY THIS IS THIS IS NOT A STATUS QUO. INDUSTRY THIS NEEDS TO BE AN INDUSTRY THAT LOOKS FORWARD TO IT TWO NEW FUTURE.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN DODD CHAIMAN GRAY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JOHN BOSWELL LONG AND I AM PRESIDENT OF THE PARA MEACHAM PLOYS GIL OF CALIFORNIA LOCAL TO EIGHTY AFFILIATED WITH THE S. C. I. YOU. WE REPRESENT NEARLY ONE THOUSAND PER MEACHAM PLOY EASE AT TRACKS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE ARE THE WORKERS WHO MAKE SURE EVERY CUSTOMER IS ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THE MANY RACES CARRIED OUT AT THE TRACK. I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF LOCAL TO EIGHTY AS A PERMIT TO CLERK AND HAVE WORK FOR VARIOUS HORSE RACING ASSOCIATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. MY FAMILY HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN HORSE RACING FOR GENERATIONS IN ALL ASPECTS. AS OWNERS TRAINERS JOCKEYS JOCKEY AGES GROOMED HOT WALKERS AND PARA MUTUAL CLERKS. MY FATHER WAS A HALL OF FAME JOCKEY WHO REGULARLY ROAD KELSO VOTED FIVE TIME HORSE OF THE YEAR WINNER FROM. NINETEEN SIXTY TO NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE HE WAS ALSO A TWO TIME KENTUCKY DERBY WINNER AND A TWO TIME. PREAKNESS STAKES WINNER WITH TEN TâM IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT AND WITH FORWARD PASS IN. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT NOT ONLY IS HORSE RACING IN MY BLOOD. BUT THE WELL BEING OF HORSES IS IN MY HEART. QUITE SIMPLY WITHOUT THE HORSES THERE IS NO HORSE RACING INDUSTRY. FROM MY UP CLOSE VIEW OF HORSE RACING. I KNOW HOW FAR THE INDUSTRY GOES TO PLACE THE WELL BEING OF THE HORSES FIRST. LIKE THE MILLIONS OF HORSE RACING FANS IN CALIFORNIA. THE MEMBERS OF MY UNION OUR HEART SICK OVER THE RECENT LOSS OF ANIMALS WE LOVE AND ADMIRE. WE SUPPORT CONTINUE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND WELL BEING ACROSS INDUSTRY FOR THESE MUCH BELOVED ANIMALS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT. FOUND OUT FOUND THAT HORSE VISIT FATALITIES IN CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING HAVE BEEN REDUCED NEARLY WITH MUCH OF THAT DECREASE IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION TO THE DESK AND SENDING IT TRACKS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE EVEN GREATER SAFETY. FOR THE HORSES WE LOVE. GETTING BACK TO RACING SAFETY IS ALSO A MATTER OF SURVIVAL FOR THOSE OF US WHO WORK WITH THE HORSES. AT ONE TIME HORSE RACING CALIFORNIA HAPPEN FIVE OR SIX DAYS A WEEK. NOW WE ARE AT THREE OR FOUR RACING AT SENDING THE TRACK IS AT THREE OUR WORKERS HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO THIS INDUSTRY FOR DECADES AND EVERY WORKER DESERVES THE STABILITY. OF EMPLOYMENT ALONG WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT ON THE JOB. THIS REDUCTION AFFECTS PARA MUTUAL STAFF OTHER UNION MEMBERS AT THE TRACKS AS WELL AS JOCKEYS OWNERS TRAINERS INVENTORS. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR LOCAL TO EIGHTY MEMBERS TERRY BENTSEN HAS BEEN DEEPLY IMPACTED BY THE REDUCTION TO THREE DAYS A WEEK. SHE WAS FORCED TO GET ANOTHER JOB TO SUPPORT THE SUPPLEMENTARY INCOME AND IS USING A CAR GIVEN TO HER BY HER FAMILY FOR TRANSPORTATION. SHE'S BARELY MAKING ENDS MEET. AND AS HER INCOME IS BELOW POVERTY LEVEL SHE HAS MOVED INTO SECTION EIGHT HOUSING. SHE WANTS TO WORK FULL TIME AND MAKE A DECENT LIVING WAGE AND REGAIN SOME OF HER DIGNITY AND RESPECT AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE RACING INDUSTRY. SHE WORRIES THAT THE INSTABILITY WILL MEAN CONTINUED STRUGGLE OUT OR I'M SORRY TO DO THIS CHEN INJURE WRAP UP OKAY. YEAH I'M ALMOST DONE HERE SO -- MEETS CONSIST DRIVE FOR HER FAMILY HER WORRIES ARE SHARED BY MANY OTHER TRACK EMPLOYEES WHEN SENDING IT WAS CLOSED IN MARCH OUR MEMBERS WERE OUT OF WORK WITH NO INCOME. THE CURRENT ACTION IN RACINE DAYS REPRESENTS 25% CUT IN MEMBERS WEEKLY INCOME. MONEY THEY NEED TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE RAN AND EVEN THEIR KIDS COLLEGE TUITION. STAFFING REDUCTIONS ACROSS THE STATE MEANS SOME MEMBERS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS COMPLETELY. UNION MEMBERS WHO WERE ABLE TO WORK EVERY WEEK AND NOW FIND THEMSELVES WITH NO WORK AT ALL IN CONCLUSION. A CONCLUSION OF I'VE I MADE ONLY I JUST READ YOUR WHOLE SPEAK GO IT GO AHEAD IN CONCLUSION WE SUPPORT SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE CONDITIONS THE RACING INDUSTRY. AND THE WELL BEING OF ALL HORSES BUT WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST AND LOSS OF WORK TO ALL PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I THINK WE ALL DO TO THANK YOU THANK ALL OF YOU VERY VERY MUCH. WE'RE GONNA GO THERE WAS A SCRATCH AT THE GATE. WE CANCELED THE THOROUGHBRED AFTER CARE IN AWARENESS RACE. WILL NOT BE HAPPENING TODAY WE'LL JUST HAVE TO GET BACK TO THAT A DIFFERENT TIME WE'RE MOVING TO GET NOBODY'S EVEN LAUGHTER THAT'S OUT LATER. ALL RIGHT SO. YEAH SO ANYWAY WE'RE GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT NOW DO WE HAVE A MIKE READY. HOW MANY HOW MANY WISHING -- TO AS A PUBLIC COMMENT JUST COME UP TO THE TABLE. PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR WAITING I KNOW THE YOU HAD. I'M GOING. TO APPLY. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD HERE DONE. AND EVERYONE -- I'M JUDY MAN CREW SO FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION AS MOST OF YOU KNOW WE ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE VOICELESS IN CALIFORNIA. ANIMAL LOVERS SUCH AS MYSELF AND OUR SUPPORTERS WANT TO KNOW SO THAT ALL THE WANT TO KNOW THAT ALL THE FORCES THAT HAVE DIED HAVE NOT DIED IN VAIN WE NEED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF HORSE RACE SCENE AND THE TIME IS NOW NO MORE DELAYS AND NO MORE. EXCUSES PERSONALLY I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE TRACK OWNERS FIND ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE MONEY AND MAINTAIN OR GROW JOBS SUCH AS TURNING THEIR VENUES INTO OTHER MONEY MAKING FACILITIES OR INTO HOUSING THAT IS SORELY NEEDED IN OUR STATE. OR ANY OTHER OF THE MANY OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST FOR THEM EACH OF THESE NEW POTENTIAL TRANSFORMATIONS CAN CREATE JOBS EVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR MANY MORE JOBS WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE ANIMALS USED IN ENTERTAINMENT GO BY THE WAYSIDE. THESE ANIMALS COULD NOT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES ON WHEN THEY ARE IN PAIN OR NOT UP TO RUNNING AROUND THE TRACK AN UNNATURAL SPEEDS. THEY SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS A DISPOSABLE COMMODITY TO BE ABUSED FORSAKEN AND THROWN AWAY. HOWEVER IF THE TIME IS NOT RIGHT THEN WE MUST RAISE OUR STANDARDS TO BE THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD AND NOT ONE MORE HORROR SHOULD DIE. THERE ARE PREVENTIVE MEASURES THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THIS CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE BEHIND HONG KONG AND DO BY WE NEED NOT ONLY TO MATCH THEIR STANDARDS BUT TO EXCEED THEM. MY GROUP IS WORKING ALONGSIDE PIZZA AS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT KATHY GILL AMERO WHO IS THE LEADING EXPERT IN HORSE RACING FOR THE ANIMAL RIGHTS COMMUNITY WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THE STRONG A GROUP BELINDA AND HER TEAM WHO ARE OPEN AND WILLING PARTNERS FOR CHANGE AS YOU HEARD HERE. TODAY AND THE C. H. R. B. WHO HAS NOT HAD AS MANY WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN THE PAST TO SEE THROUGH GROUNDBREAKING STANDARDS FOR THEIR INDUSTRY WE HAVE MET MULTIPLE TIMES WITH THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF AND MANY OTHERS IN THE LEGISLATURE. LEGISLATURE TO BEGIN CREATING LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE MAJOR CHANGE CHANGES THAT MUST BE AMPLE MINUTE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND IN THE UPCOMING MONTHS WE WILL BE MOVING LEGISLATION. AND OF COURSE FOR THE MAJESTIC COURSES THAT NEEDLESSLY DIED. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M GOING TO THE AIRPORT. BUT BY NEXT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME'S CATHY GILLIAM -- I'M WITH PEOPLE FOR THE ETHICAL TREATMENT OF ANIMALS OR PIZZA I'M ALSO A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT -- EVERYBODY TODAY HAS HAD A LOT OF INTERESTING COMMENTS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HORSES WHO DIED BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT EVERY YEAR DOZENS AND DOZENS OF HORSES DIE ON CALIFORNIA RACETRACKS. AND WE KNOW FROM NEW CROPS IS DONE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS THE PRE EXISTING INJURIES AT THE SIGHT OF THOSE BREAKS OFTEN EXIST. WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN MEDICATIONS THAT MASK INJURIES ARE GIVEN LEGALLY AND THIS CAUSES A PROBLEM I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST A WEIRD ANOMALY THAT IN SIX WEEKS THERE WERE NO DEATHS AT SANTA ANITA? I THINK THE RULES THAT SANTA NEED TO PUT IN PLACE ARE WORKING AND THOSE RULES INVOLVE PULLING BACK ON THOSE MEDICATIONS AND NOT MAKING SURE THE INJURED HORSES ARE GOING ON THE TRACK. WE NEED TO DO MORE OF THAT THERE'S MORE THAT CAN BE DONE MORE MEDICATION WITHDRAWAL HORSES SHOULDN'T BE RUNNING ON FETAL BUTTE IS OWN IS ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THEM ARE IN TWO DAYS BEFORE. A RACE THERE IS SOPHISTICATED SCAN TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL SCAN ON ALL FOUR LEGS OF A HORSE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN UNDER ONE MINUTE AND DETECT A LOT OF THIS INJURY. AND IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK THAT VIOLATORS BE KICKED OUT OF THE SPORT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF MEDICATION VIOLATIONS AND THEY NEED TO GO. THERE'S MORE THAT CAN BE DONE BUT MOST OF ALL FORCES SHOULD NOT BE THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE IN RACING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THAT INCLUDES -- THIS HEARING I DO WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR ITS HERE STILL -- THE HANG HANG OUT THE ENTIRE TIME WE APOLOGIZE FOR THIS IS A TOUGH TIME A YEAR TO HAVE. A HEARING BECAUSE BOTH HOUSES ARE INVOLVED IN -- THE HOUSE OF LORDS SHOULD DEADLINES HEARING ALL THE BILLS BUT WE FELT THAT THIS WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE -- IN OUR STATE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE YEAH WE AT LEAST HAD THE HEARING. THAT HAD STARTED AN HOUR LATER I FEEL REALLY GOOD WE CAN BE GIVEN EVERYBODY THAT. THE TIME AND RESPECT THEY NEEDED I APOLOGIZE TO ANYBODY IF I WAS OFFENSIVE TRIED. TO GET HERE BY SIX PM BUT THIS MEETING IS NOW ADJOURNED YEAH
