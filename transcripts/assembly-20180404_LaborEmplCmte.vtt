BILL MENTIONED I STARTED LOOKING

00:29:14.553 --> 00:29:17.522 region:rollup2
AT THIS ISSUE.

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:19.925 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF A CONTAMINATED GUN

00:29:17.522 --> 00:29:21.226 region:rollup2
RANGE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND

00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:22.694 region:rollup2
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS CALLED

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:23.962 region:rollup2
.

00:29:22.828 --> 00:29:26.498 region:rollup2
THE.

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:27.599 region:rollup2
THE RANGE CONTENT WITH BADLY CAN

THE PARK AND IN NEIGHBORING

00:29:33.305 --> 00:29:36.141 region:rollup2
HOMES WAS ALSO QUITE

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:37.976 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATED. AND I STARTED TO

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:39.645 region:rollup2
LOOK IN THIS STORY ONE OF THINGS

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:41.213 region:rollup2
THAT I LEARNED WAS THAT.

00:29:39.645 --> 00:29:42.848 region:rollup2
YEARS BEFORE A CLOSED SYSTEM

00:29:41.213 --> 00:29:44.549 region:rollup2
LIKE THIRTEEN YEARS PRIOR THE

00:29:42.848 --> 00:29:46.318 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:47.619 region:rollup2
HEALTH BECAME AWARE OF.

00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:49.288 region:rollup2
VERY SERIOUS LEAD POISONING

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:50.188 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS INCLUDING AN INCREDIBLY

00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:52.591 region:rollup2
LET PUTTING WORKER WHO

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:54.293 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENTLY ACTUALLY DIED. ON

00:29:52.591 --> 00:29:56.194 region:rollup2
THE MOST LIKELY FROM THE FROM

00:29:54.293 --> 00:29:58.864 region:rollup2
LEAD POISONING IT IMPACTS

00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:59.531 region:rollup2
I AM AND WHAT I FOUND JUST

00:29:58.864 --> 00:30:01.400 region:rollup2
SURPRISING WAS THAT.

00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:03.368 region:rollup2
THE.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.070 region:rollup2
CITY P. H..

00:30:03.368 --> 00:30:07.673 region:rollup2
DIDN'T INFORM CALLOSUM THAT THIS

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.840 region:rollup2
WORKER HAD.

00:30:07.673 --> 00:30:11.076 region:rollup2
IT OUT OF A POTENTIALLY DEADLY

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.144 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF OF OF LEAD POISONING

00:30:11.076 --> 00:30:12.644 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON I THINK THEY SAID

00:30:12.144 --> 00:30:14.846 region:rollup2
THEY. DIDN'T DO THAT WAS

00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:16.748 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:18.450 region:rollup2
THEY PREFER TO WORK WITH

00:30:16.748 --> 00:30:19.718 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS AND ONLY AS A LAST

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.352 region:rollup2
RESORT WOULD.

00:30:19.718 --> 00:30:21.920 region:rollup2
INFORMED CAL OSHA OF THE

00:30:20.352 --> 00:30:24.156 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.458 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT JUST YOU KNOW EITHER

00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:27.125 region:rollup2
SO MANY STORIES AS YOU AS IF YOU

00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:29.227 region:rollup2
FOLKS NOW.

STRUCK ME IT'S JUSTIN SOUND

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:35.567 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO I STARTED LOOKING INTO

00:30:32.864 --> 00:30:38.136 region:rollup2
IT. AND WITH THE HELP OF THE US

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:39.838 region:rollup2

AND SIXTEEN. APPROPRIATED A

00:30:49.748 --> 00:30:54.186 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:55.654 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO CLEAN UP THAT THAT

00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:57.322 region:rollup2
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND THERE BE

00:30:55.654 --> 00:31:00.025 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE TEN THOUSAND

00:30:57.322 --> 00:31:00.592 region:rollup2
HOMES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. I'M

00:31:00.025 --> 00:31:02.561 region:rollup2
WITH UNSAFE LEVELS OF LEAD.

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:03.762 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:04.563 region:rollup2
I'M I KNEW THAT WAS GONNA BE BAD

00:31:03.762 --> 00:31:06.298 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT THERE HAD TO BE

00:31:04.563 --> 00:31:07.866 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS INSIDE THE PLANT BUT

00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:10.268 region:rollup2
I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR WHAT WE

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:11.636 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FOUND. WHICH WAS THAT

00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:13.238 region:rollup2
BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:15.607 region:rollup2
AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:16.608 region:rollup2
THE PLANT CLOSED CD P. H. WAS

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:18.543 region:rollup2
AWARE OF.

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:20.946 region:rollup2
OVER TWENTY THREE HUNDRED CASES

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:22.714 region:rollup2
OF.

00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:23.648 region:rollup2
BOB DOUBLE OF LOW BLOOD LEAD

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:24.516 region:rollup2
TESTS WHICH WERE BASICALLY LEAD

00:31:23.648 --> 00:31:26.518 region:rollup2
POISONED WORKERS WITH A VERY

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:27.319 region:rollup2
SERIOUS LEVEL OF OF OF LEAD IN

00:31:26.518 --> 00:31:29.955 region:rollup2
THEIR FIGHT. OVER ABOUT TWENTY

00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:31.790 region:rollup2
FIVE MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER

00:31:29.955 --> 00:31:32.724 region:rollup2
AND DURING THIS TIME.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.793 region:rollup2
.

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:36.895 region:rollup2
CALOSOMA KID ONE INSPECTION

00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:38.997 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY FIND THAT EXCITE A

00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:40.165 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS.

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:41.900 region:rollup2

00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:44.569 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW IT'S JUST

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.971 region:rollup2
REALLY STRIKING AND YOU KNOW

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:47.205 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WAS YOU KNOW WE

00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:49.374 region:rollup2
FELT WE HAD TO REPORT OF COURSE.

00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:50.208 region:rollup2
AND.

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:52.043 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE ONE OF THE THINGS

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:53.845 region:rollup2
THAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE

00:31:52.043 --> 00:31:56.248 region:rollup2
PROBABLY CALIFORNIA'S REALLY A

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:57.048 region:rollup2
SYSTEMIC ONE? I'M BECAUSE YOU

00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:58.316 region:rollup2

00:31:57.048 --> 00:32:00.418 region:rollup2
AGENCY COLLECTING THIS

00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:02.287 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ANNA ON THE OTHER

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:03.855 region:rollup2
HAND YOU HAVE ONE THAT'S. IF

FORCING LABOR LAWS AND THERE'S

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:07.392 region:rollup2
ZERO CLARITY AS TO WHEN THAT

00:32:06.825 --> 00:32:09.861 region:rollup2
INFORMATION MUST BE SHARED.

00:32:07.392 --> 00:32:10.662 region:rollup2
.

00:32:09.861 --> 00:32:11.763 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW BASS WITH

AND.

00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:16.535 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE SURPRISING THINGS

00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:17.769 region:rollup2
THAT I FOUND I THINK WHY THIS

00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:19.805 region:rollup2
BILL IS SO IMPORTANT.

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:22.107 region:rollup2
IS THAT THIS ISN'T THE CASE

00:32:19.805 --> 00:32:24.709 region:rollup2

HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS.

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:31.149 region:rollup2
I.

00:32:30.015 --> 00:32:32.784 region:rollup2
THE ANOTHER EXIDE BATTERIES

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:34.920 region:rollup2
LIKELY PLAN IN FORT SMITH

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:36.555 region:rollup2
ARKANSAS WAS FINE SEVENTY ONE

THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HAVING THE

00:32:36.555 --> 00:32:39.958 region:rollup2
SAME KIND OF HIGH LEVEL THAT

00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:42.127 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF LEAD AT THAT PLANT. SO

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:43.261 region:rollup2
WHY WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

00:32:42.127 --> 00:32:45.297 region:rollup2
HERE'S THE HERE'S THAT THE KEY

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:46.531 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE ARKANSAS LIKE THIRTY

00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:48.834 region:rollup2
EIGHT OTHER STATES HAS CLEARED

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:50.735 region:rollup2
LAWS WHICH STATE THAT ANY TIME

00:32:48.834 --> 00:32:52.938 region:rollup2
WORKERS HAVE THAT TWENTY FIVE.

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:54.840 region:rollup2
MICROGRAMS OR HIGHER AYE LEVEL

00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:56.107 region:rollup2
OF OF OF LEAD IN THEIR BLOOD

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.610 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE SAME LEVEL AS AS

00:32:56.107 --> 00:33:01.346 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMAN KALRA HAS IN HIS IN

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:04.115 region:rollup2
HIS BILL. I'M THAT DEALT THOSE

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:06.051 region:rollup2
THEN I'M QUOTING HERE I'M IN THE

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.918 region:rollup2
WORK THAT DOES.

00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:07.886 region:rollup2
SHALL BE CONSIDERED HIGH GRAVITY

00:33:06.918 --> 00:33:09.087 region:rollup2
SERIOUS AND MUST BE HANDLED BY

00:33:07.886 --> 00:33:10.622 region:rollup2
INSPECTION

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:12.958 region:rollup2
I REPEAT MUST BE HANDLED BY

00:33:10.622 --> 00:33:13.725 region:rollup2
INSPECTION YET AT EXCITE WE HAD

00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:15.827 region:rollup2
THESE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:16.928 region:rollup2
WORKERS. WHO HAD THIS LEVEL

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:18.663 region:rollup2
AND ONE INSPECTION IN TWO

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:20.632 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHT?

AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR

00:33:20.632 --> 00:33:24.236 region:rollup2
OF FINES SO THIS JUST IT JUST

00:33:22.868 --> 00:33:25.570 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE A KIND OF.

00:33:24.236 --> 00:33:26.137 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT BETWEEN THESE

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.306 region:rollup2
AGENCIES ATTEMPT OF GETTING

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:29.975 region:rollup2

BLOOD LEAD LEVELS.

00:35:56.988 --> 00:36:01.159 region:rollup2
THEN THIS COULD ADD ANOTHER SIX

LEGISLATION HAS SAID THAT BROKEN

SOMEBODY GETS SICK.

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:40.985 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:42.187 region:rollup2
CREATE A LAW COULD THIS SEEMS TO

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:45.623 region:rollup2
BE A LITTLE MORE PREVENTATIVE SO

00:38:42.187 --> 00:38:48.359 region:rollup2
I TRIED UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:49.561 region:rollup2
ISSUES?

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:50.562 region:rollup2
IRVINE I THINK YOUR SUMMER JONES

00:38:49.561 --> 00:38:50.995 region:rollup2
SAWYER AYE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT

00:38:50.562 --> 00:38:52.263 region:rollup2
IS A

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:53.565 region:rollup2
PREVENTIVE MEASURE

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:57.035 region:rollup2
IN THAT WE WANTED PREVENT.

00:38:53.565 --> 00:38:59.537 region:rollup2
A MAJOR A PUBLIC HEALTH. ISSUES

00:38:57.035 --> 00:39:01.239 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHE IS EVEN A TO OCCUR

00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:02.841 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY WE DO THAT IS BY NOT

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:03.908 region:rollup2
JUST HAVING THE INFORMATION

00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:06.177 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE INFORMATION THE

00:39:03.908 --> 00:39:08.179 region:rollup2
PROMISE OR NOT. DIRECTING.

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:09.647 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT AS TO WHAT TO DO

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:11.416 region:rollup2
WITH THAT INFORMATION GETTING IT

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:12.684 region:rollup2
OVER TO CAL OSHA. A IS

00:39:11.416 --> 00:39:14.018 region:rollup2
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:15.553 region:rollup2
THEY CAN DECIDE THAT WHAT THE

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:17.121 region:rollup2
NEXT STEPS ARE THE BACK THE

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:18.489 region:rollup2
MATTER IS YOU CAN HAVE YEARS AND

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:20.225 region:rollup2
YEARS AND YEARS OF DATA. AND IF

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:21.693 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT

00:39:20.225 --> 00:39:22.360 region:rollup2
AND YOU DON'T DIRECT.

00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:23.928 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC PUBLIC HEALTH AS TO

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.296 region:rollup2
WHAT TO DO WITH THAT AND CAL

00:39:23.928 --> 00:39:26.164 region:rollup2
OSHA IS NOT AWARE OF IT THEN

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:27.599 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE POINT OF COLLECTING

00:39:26.164 --> 00:39:30.034 region:rollup2
THAT DATA AND LET'S KEEP IN MIND

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:30.235 region:rollup2
AS WELL. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:32.270 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:39:30.235 --> 00:39:33.671 region:rollup2
.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.672 region:rollup2
D. I AM THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:35.573 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:38.409 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING WHAT WHAT WOULD

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:39.711 region:rollup2
REQUIRE. OF REPORTING IT A

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:40.545 region:rollup2
SETTING APART TO QALISYA.

00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:42.780 region:rollup2
IS TWENTY FIVE MICROGRAMS PER

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:44.282 region:rollup2
DECILITER.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.750 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE CDC

00:39:44.282 --> 00:39:48.119 region:rollup2
REVISED REVISES GUIDANCEON

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.454 region:rollup2
ADULT LED DOWN FROM TWENTY FIVE

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:51.222 region:rollup2
MICRONS. TO TEN.

00:39:49.454 --> 00:39:52.156 region:rollup2
MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER EVEN

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:54.659 region:rollup2
LOWER THAN OUR RECOMMENDED

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:56.127 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD SO WE COULD EVEN GO TO

00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:58.529 region:rollup2
A LOWER THRESHOLD I THINK.

00:39:56.127 --> 00:40:00.365 region:rollup2
I THINK MATCHING ARKANSAS IS A

00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:02.267 region:rollup2
GOOD PLACE TO START TO ENSURE

00:40:00.365 --> 00:40:04.269 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T ALLOW. LEVELS OF

00:40:02.267 --> 00:40:06.204 region:rollup2
LEAD TO CONTINUE AT THE WORK

00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:07.505 region:rollup2
SITE BECAUSE FRANKLY I'M I THINK

00:40:06.204 --> 00:40:09.140 region:rollup2
MOST EMPLOYERS WITH IF THEY KNOW

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:10.842 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S THE CASE WILL DO

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.443 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. UP BUT GO DO

00:40:10.842 --> 00:40:13.678 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ABOUT IT IF THEY HAD

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:15.113 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND CAL OSHA WORKS

00:40:13.678 --> 00:40:15.914 region:rollup2
WITH THEM TO ENSURE THEY DO

00:40:15.113 --> 00:40:17.749 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ABOUT.

00:40:15.914 --> 00:40:19.350 region:rollup2
SO AB AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS

00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:21.386 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT WORKER SAFETY WORKER

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.954 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS BUT ULTIMATELY IT

00:40:21.386 --> 00:40:24.689 region:rollup2
SAVES EMPLOYERS IN THE LONG RUN

00:40:22.954 --> 00:40:26.758 region:rollup2
AS WELL FROM HAVING TO. DO A

00:40:24.689 --> 00:40:27.892 region:rollup2
MUCH GREATER REMEDIAL WORK THAN

00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:29.427 region:rollup2
IF THEY HAD THAT INFORMATION

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:31.396 region:rollup2
EARLY ON AND WERE GIVEN

00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:33.531 region:rollup2
DIRECTION TO AN INSPECTION TO AN

00:40:31.396 --> 00:40:36.134 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION EARLY ON. AND AYE

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:39.537 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY HELPS EMPLOYERS

00:40:36.134 --> 00:40:41.472 region:rollup2
MAKE THEIR OF. WORK SITE SAPER

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:43.107 region:rollup2
AND ECONOMICALLY A IS ALSO

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:44.242 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL TO THEM AS WELL UP

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:45.977 region:rollup2
BUT OF COURSE THE CRUX OF THIS

00:40:44.242 --> 00:40:47.745 region:rollup2
BILL IS WORKER SAFETY.

00:40:45.977 --> 00:40:50.581 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY COMMUNITY

00:40:47.745 --> 00:40:51.115 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:52.550 region:rollup2
FAR TOO MANY EXAMPLES OF.

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:54.085 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT LACK

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.620 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION AND TO AND

00:40:54.085 --> 00:40:57.922 region:rollup2
DIRECTION AS TO WHAT TO DO THAT

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.991 region:rollup2
INFORMATION. THAT UP WE'RE NOT

00:40:57.922 --> 00:41:01.459 region:rollup2
DOING OUR JOB AS AS LEGISLATORS

00:40:59.991 --> 00:41:04.028 region:rollup2
AND AS A STATE TO MAKE SURE

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:06.731 region:rollup2
PROTECTING OUR WORKERS.

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:08.833 region:rollup2
I KNOW CHAMBER CAME ITEM ONE OF.

00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:11.102 region:rollup2
DID YOU. CAN ONLY GO OUT PLEASE

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:12.003 region:rollup2
COME FORWARD FAIRS COME FORWARD.

00:41:11.102 --> 00:41:14.706 region:rollup2
AND I AYE MY AND MY DISTRICTS

00:41:12.003 --> 00:41:15.573 region:rollup2
RIGHT NEXT TO THE EXCISE EXCITE

00:41:14.706 --> 00:41:17.508 region:rollup2
PLANTS THEN AND IT'S HAD AN

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:18.509 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON MY. COMMUNITY MY

00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:19.544 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS.

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:21.913 region:rollup2
AND IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:41:19.544 --> 00:41:22.914 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE PREVENTED.

00:41:21.913 --> 00:41:26.250 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED ELECT SIDE OF?

00:41:22.914 --> 00:41:27.251 region:rollup2
I'M MORE.

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.287 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BEEN DOING THIS AWHILE

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:30.188 region:rollup2
AGO SO I JUST WANT TO HEAR. WHAT

00:41:29.287 --> 00:41:31.522 region:rollup2
YOU'RE?

00:41:30.188 --> 00:41:34.225 region:rollup2
THINK UNITS AGAIN OR DID I

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:39.530 region:rollup2
SO OUR OUR ISSUE ISN'T THAT

00:41:37.729 --> 00:41:41.432 region:rollup2
WHETHER.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.700 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SAFETY HAZARD HERE ARE

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:44.535 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH THE PROCESS AND THAT

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:46.504 region:rollup2
CAL OSHA HAS THE JURISDICTION

00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:48.406 region:rollup2
OVER WORKPLACE SAFETY IF WE HAVE

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:49.674 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE WITH WITH LEAD LEVELS

00:41:48.406 --> 00:41:51.409 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE'RE TREATING THEM AND

00:41:49.674 --> 00:41:52.910 region:rollup2
HOWARD TREATING SPORTED A LEAD.

00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:54.245 region:rollup2
IN THE WORKPLACE WE NEED TO GO

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.113 region:rollup2
THROUGH CAL OCEAN THROUGH

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:57.015 region:rollup2
STANDARD CHANNELS AND HAVE THIS

00:41:55.113 --> 00:41:57.348 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION. IF THE INFORMATION

00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:59.183 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:41:57.348 --> 00:42:01.019 region:rollup2
DID THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:02.987 region:rollup2
HEALTH IS COLLECTING. IS NOT

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:03.187 region:rollup2
GETTING CAL OSHA IN A MANNER

00:42:02.987 --> 00:42:05.156 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:06.491 region:rollup2
THAT IT SHOULD BE AND SO THAT

00:42:05.156 --> 00:42:08.159 region:rollup2
IT CAN BE DEALT WITH AND AND

00:42:06.491 --> 00:42:09.994 region:rollup2
REVIEWED AND PROPER STEPS CAN BE

00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:11.596 region:rollup2
TAKEN. THAT THAT'S ANOTHER

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:14.032 region:rollup2
QUESTION BUT TAKEN THE

00:42:11.596 --> 00:42:16.768 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND SETTING A LIMIT

00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:17.802 region:rollup2
HERE WITHOUT. THE SCIENCE BEING

00:42:16.768 --> 00:42:19.103 region:rollup2
DEBATED THROUGH THE THE MEANS

00:42:17.802 --> 00:42:20.638 region:rollup2
THE CALIPHATE HAS TO REVIEW

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:21.773 region:rollup2
SCIENCE AND THEY DO THEY HAVE A

00:42:20.638 --> 00:42:24.542 region:rollup2
SPECIAL COMMITTEE IN A SPECIAL

00:42:21.773 --> 00:42:25.743 region:rollup2
PROCESS. FOR REVIEWING HEALTH

00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.110 region:rollup2

00:42:25.743 --> 00:42:27.211 region:rollup2
US SUCH AS LEAD.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.679 region:rollup2
.

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:31.516 region:rollup2
THEN WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:33.017 region:rollup2
PERHAPS WITH CAL OSHA.

00:42:31.516 --> 00:42:34.752 region:rollup2
HOW THIS HOW THIS INFORMATION

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:36.487 region:rollup2
CAN GET TO THEM AND AND WHAT

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:38.890 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'LL DO WITH IT?

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:40.725 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S MORE FOR

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:43.294 region:rollup2
US IT'S A PROCESS QUESTION WE WE

00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:44.162 region:rollup2
WE. WE RISK HIGHLY RESPECT THE

00:42:43.294 --> 00:42:46.230 region:rollup2
WORK OF CAL OSHA AND THEIR

00:42:44.162 --> 00:42:47.265 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO IDENTIFY HAZARDS AND

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:49.233 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THEIR PRIORITIES

00:42:47.265 --> 00:42:51.202 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE LIMITS THAT THEY.

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:52.703 region:rollup2
THEY WORK WITH THEM WITHIN THAT

00:42:51.202 --> 00:42:54.172 region:rollup2
