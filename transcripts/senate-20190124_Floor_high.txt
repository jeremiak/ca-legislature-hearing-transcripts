EXCUSE ME TO BOB PRESSING ON BEHALF OF HIS LATE FATHER. THE FORMER STATE SENATOR ROBERT CLIP PRESLEY SO IF WE COULD HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE. CENTER NIELSEN THAT ARE PRESENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE AND PERMISSION TO DISPLAY THE BLUE BOOK WITHOUT OBJECTION. THIS IS A NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE ADDITION OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLUE BOOK THERE'S A BEEN A LATER ONE MORE RECENTLY ABOUT A DECADE AGO. THESE USED TO BE REGULARLY PRINTED BUT NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE BUT THIS IS THE FIRST ONE THAT SENATOR BOB PRESLEY APPEARED IN. HE HAD BEEN ELECTED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR I HAD THE PLEASURE OF COMING ALONG FOUR YEARS LATER AND SERVING. MANY YEARS WITH BOB PRESLEY. CENTER PRESLEY. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN WAS THE EPITOME. OF WHAT A CENTER [inaudible] TO BE [inaudible] DISTINGUISHED [inaudible] RESPECTFUL [inaudible] BRIGHT. VERY FOR STUDIOUSLY. HE DID THE RULES OF THE INSTITUTION. IS A FRIENDLY MAN. HE HAD A VERY WRY SENSE OF HUMOR. DRY AND DRY. AND HE HAD AN INCREDIBLE LIFE. IN WORLD WAR. TWO HE RECEIVED THE BRONZE STAR IN COMBAT [inaudible] IN ITALY. THAT'S ONE OF THE HIGHEST HONORS ACCORDED. TO A MILITARY HERO. BUT NEVER TALKED ABOUT THAT. AS DID MOST OF THE WORLD WAR TWO VETERANS. BUT HE CARRIED HIMSELF WITH THE BEARING OF ONE WHO HAD. BEEN IN VERY DIFFICULT SITUATIONS. WHO HAD COME TO TERMS OF THOSE SITUATIONS? DEALT WITH THEM AND APPLIED WHAT HE HAD LEARNED IN THOSE ARDUOUS TIMES. THE WHAT HE WAS DOING TODAY. THERE WAS A AND I WAS A BRAND NEW. SENATOR IN THE BEEN BALD AND CRIME VICTIMS ISSUES AND PUBLIC SAFETY NOT TO THE DEGREE THAT BOB PRESLEY THOUGH. HE HAD A TWENTY FOUR YEAR CAREER. IN THE RIVERSIDE [inaudible] SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AFTER THAT TIME HE SERVED IN THE THE STEAM POSITION [inaudible] AS UNDERSHERIFF. OF THAT COUNTY [inaudible] HE KNEW [inaudible] LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT CAME HERE [inaudible] ANY CERTAINLY. DID STAKE OUT. THE LEADERSHIP ROLE. AND PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT HE HAD MANY OTHER INTERESTS. CHILDREN. WERE VERY MUCH [inaudible] OF INTEREST [inaudible] BOB PRESLEY. HE HAS SERVED AS HEAD OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. MANY COMMITTEES THE SERVER. AND DURING THE PERIOD WHEN WE WERE BUILDING PRISONS. HE WAS A CHAIR. APPROPRIATELY OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. THE CAP ON AYE ON HOW WE WERE DOING THESE PRISONS AND THAT WE WERE GETTING THEM DONE. AND THAT THEY WERE FUNCTIONING. HE WAS QUITE A ENVIRONMENTALIST AS WELL. KERRY MANY BILLS PARTICULAR RELATED TO AIR QUALITY. THE DISTRICT HE REPRESENTED IS BEEN MUCH AFFECTED OVER THE DECADES. WITH AIR POLLUTION. AND BOB IS ALWAYS. AT THE HEAD OF THE CURVE FIGHTING. FOR CLEAN AIR. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT HE REPRESENTED BOB PRESLEY. VOTED. THE DISTRICT [inaudible] NOT [inaudible] THE PARTY. BUT THE DISTRICT THAT HE REPRESENTED. THAT'S WHAT I WAS ALWAYS SO OVERWHELMINGLY [inaudible] ELECTED [inaudible] AND REELECTED. AS A ROOKIE SENATOR I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ONE OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE GANG OF FOUR MAYBE IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SO CALLED GAINES AROUND THIS PLACE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL SENSE BUT THE GANG OF FOUR THEN WAS. BOB PRESLEY. AND JIM NIELSEN IN THE SENATE ALISTAIR MCALLISTER. AND DAVE STERLING IN THE ASSEMBLY. TWO REPUBLICANS TWO DEMOCRATS. THE GANG OF FOUR AUTHORED ALL OF THE MAJOR PUBLIC SAFETY BILLS. OF THAT ERA. AND I DO NOT KNOW WHO GAVE US THAT DESIGNATION THE GANG OF FOUR BUT IT WAS AN INTERESTING COMBINATION. A BI PARTISAN [inaudible] COMBINATION. AND ONE YEAR WE PUT TOGETHER SOMETHING CALLED COMMITMENT TO COUNTIES TO COUNTIES OF ALWAYS BEEN THE STEPCHILD OF GOVERNMENT. IN MANY RESPECTS. THEN THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT TO HELP THE COUNTIES. VERY A SERVICE CARRIED WERE THE LEAD WITH THE OTHERS BEING JOINT AUTHORS. BOB GREAT CONTRIBUTION BEING THE LEAD AUTHOR. OF SOMETHING THOSE CALL TRIAL COURT FUNDING. IN WHICH I WOULD SAY YET EVEN TODAY IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW IF NOT THE ONLY TIME THE STATE HAS EVER CAPAS WORD TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TRIAL COURT FUNDING WAS THIS SYSTEM. WITH THE CONDUCT THEIR TRIAL COURTS [inaudible] FINANCIAL. AND IT STAYED AROUND. IT WAS A QUESTION. FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND IT CERTAINLY DID HELP OUR COUNTIES IN UNDERSTAND THAT KINDA CAME ON THE HEELS OF PROP. THIRTEEN COUNTY SAN WERE STRUGGLING. AND THIS WAS VERY HELPFUL. THAT I CONSIDER THAT ONE OF THE LANDMARK ACCOMPLISHMENTS BOB PRESLEY [inaudible] HE WITH SUCH A A FRIENDLY FELLOW. I DON'T THINK I'VE SAW HIM GET ANGRY. THE MOST I COULD SAY I SAW BOB PRESLEY AS HE WOULD GET SERIOUS. NOW HE DID NOT END HIS SERVING THE PEOPLE. JUST IN THE STATE SENATE. HE THEN WENT ON TO OTHER POSITIONS. FOR A TIME AS THE CARE OF THE YOUTHFUL OFFENDER PAROLE BOARD. GOVERNOR DAVIS APPOINTED HIM. TO THE SECRETARY. OF THE END WAS CALLED THE YOUTH AND ADULT CORRECTIONS AGENCY NOW IT'S CALLED THE WHAT WOULD WE CHANGE THE NAME HIGH GOODNESS IT SEE -- NOT YA QUE ANYMORE. NOT THINK OF IT. HE BECAME THE CHAIRMAN. THE SECRETARY THE ENTIRE AGENCY UNDER DAVIS. THEN WHY CAPACITY AT THE BOARD OF PRISON TERMS. AND BRIEFLY AT THE IS OFTEN A PRO ABORT I GOT TO HELP AND WORK WITH [inaudible] BOB. DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION IS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR HERE. AND BOB WAS A TOUGH ON CRIME GUY. BUT HE ALSO [inaudible] WAS. VERY DEDICATED THE REHABILITATION WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS. SO THAT WHATEVER WE PUT OUT. WHOEVER DID COME OUT UNDER ORDER OF LAW UNDER THE TERMS SENSE LAW OR BY APPROVAL. ABOARD PRISON TERMS OF THE ACTUAL OFFENDER PAROLE BOARD. THAT THEY WERE REALLY READY. THEY HIT THE STREETS. BOB IS VERY DISCERNING IN THAT REGARD. IT DID A FINE JOB. AND I CANNOT SAY THAT I EVER SAW MUCH [inaudible] PARTISANSHIP [inaudible] BOB PRESLEY. THEY ALWAYS RECEIVE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT. AND IS DISTRICT [inaudible] FROM REPUBLICANS. THOUGH HIS DISTRICT. LOS LEAN REPUBLICAN AND HE WAS A UNAPOLOGETIC DEMOCRAT. I GATHER WHAT WE THEN CALLED A ROOSEVELT DEMOCRAT. LATER A REAGAN DEMOCRAT. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT PREOCCUPIED BUT PRESLEY. IT WASN'T THE POLITICAL PERSUASION. THAT WASN'T HOW FAR LEFT TO RIGHT [inaudible] ANYBODY WAS. IT WAS WHAT WAS GOOD FOR THE DISTRICT THAT HE REPRESENTED I BELIEVE WAS THE THIRTY FOURTH. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MAN OF ABSOLUTE INTEGRITY. KINDA THE CUSTODIAN OF THE ETHICS OF THE INSTITUTION. WAS BOB PRESLEY ANY ALWAYS SERVED. ON THOSE KEY COMMITTEES THE OVERSIGHT. BOB HAD A VERY. CLOSE KNIT STAFF [inaudible] AND FAMILY [inaudible] TODAY. HIS SON BOB IS HERE WITH US. THERE'S QUITE A RESEMBLANCE OF HIS FATHER. ALSO TRISH PRESLEY. THAT'S BOB'S WIFE. MARYLAND RAFAEL. AND DONNA DANIELS THOSE ARE BOB'S SISTER'S. ADD UP HIS STAFF THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW WELL OVER THE YEARS. TO SUSAN WALLACE. BOB FRENZY IS BACK IN THE ROOM HERE AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM COME UP SO WE CAN RECOGNIZE IN WITH -- CENTER ROTH. RICHARD MARX IN [inaudible] SUSAN WALLACE. AND KAREN FRENCH. KAREN HAS BEEN A LONG TIME INSTITUTION HERE WORKED BOB ON THE FISCAL COMMITTEE. AND SHE TOLD ME TODAY THAT SHE JUST RETIRED. MAYBE A APPROPRIATE TIME FOR HIM TO RETIRE WHEN WE'RE RECOGNIZING THEIR FORMER BOSS [inaudible] BOB PRESLEY. MANY PEOPLE HAVE SERVE HERE A LITTLE OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA HAVE SERVED IN THE STATE SENATE OF ALL THE BILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED IN THE STATE BOB PRESLEY. WILL RATE IS ONE OF THE BEST. EVEN AT THE TIME VARIOUS. INSTITUTIONS THAT RATED LEGISLATORS. ALWAYS PUT BOB. THE TO TALK. HE MANAGES BILLOWED ABLY. DIDN'T KERRY STATEMENT BILLS. THE BILL SHE CARRIED WE'RE IMPORTANT. THEY GOT MOST OF THEM PASSED. THEY GOT ALONG VERY WELL WITH REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS. AS WELL AS DEMOCRATIC. GOVERNORS. IN THE AS I NOTED HE WAS EVEN APPOINTED AGENCY SECRETARY. THAT IS THE RESUL CORRECTIONS. BY GOVERNOR DAVIS. IF YOU EVER WANTED. TO CRAFT WHAT I WOULD SAY THE PERFECT. PERSON. TO BE HONEST HONORABLE BODY. MEMBER OF IT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN [inaudible] AND WAS. SENATOR BOB PRESS. I ASKED LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THAT YOU. HONOR HIM TODAY. THE JOURNEY IN HIS MEMORY. BUT DON'T LET THAT JUST PASSED TODAY. THOSE OF YOU WHO NOW SERVE. KEEP IN MIND DOES TO PASS THROUGH HERE BEFORE YOU. AND WHEN WE MEMORIALIZE SOMEONE LIKE BOB PRESLEY. KEEPING ON YOUR MIND WHY? BECAUSE THERE WERE GOOD EXAMPLES OF INDIVIDUALS WHOSE EXAMPLE OUGHT NOT BE LOST. ON US TODAY. WHEN THINGS ALONG WITH DIFFERENT? A BIT MORE PARTISAN RULES ARE NOT AS IMPORTANT. LET'S THINK ABOUT THE TIME WHEN THERE WERE PEOPLE THE WORK HISTORIANS OF THAT INTEGRITY. AND THAT RESPECT FOR THE INSTITUTION [inaudible] BOB PRESLEY. IS THAT PERSON. MAY GOD BLESS HIM AND HIS FAMILY. MAYBE REST IN THE MANSIONS OF THE LORD. THANK YOU FOR JOINING. IN MEMORY OF BOB PRESLEY. I THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN ON THIS IN TURN IN MEMORY.

WITH THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. MOST NOTABLY SENATOR DAVE KELLY HOW MANY OF YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER WHILE THEY WERE BOTH SENATORS FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY FROM DIFFERENT PARTIES AND HE OFTEN REMINISCE HOW THEY WOULD -- GO ACROSS THE STREET AT THE HYATT AND HAVE A COUPLE OF DRINKS AND SETTLE THE SCORE. AND MOVE LEGISLATION. I IN THE BEST INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA. BOTH COMPROMISING TO TO DO WHAT WAS BEST. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW THERE'S ONE COMMON DENOMINATOR OF BEING A MEMBER OF A FAMILY. AND BEING A MEMBER OF THE SENATE. AND IS THAT ISSUED CANNOT PICK YOUR RELATIVES.

INJURED IN HIS MEMORY. THANK YOU SENATOR STONE ANY OTHER. PEOPLE WISH TO SPEAK. SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW BOB PRESLEY'S LIFE WAS ABOUT SERVICE. SERVICE TO HIS FAMILY SERVICE TO HIS COMMUNITY. AND SERVICE TO HIS COUNTRY. MY COLLEAGUE A SPOKE ELOQUENTLY ABOUT SENATOR PRESLEY'S SERVICE IN WORLD WAR TWO MEMBER OF THE GREATEST GENERATION. WE FEE SERVE A GENERAL MARK MARK AND THAT FIFTH ARMY IN ITALY. WE'RE HE RECEIVED A BRONZE STAR FOR HER WAS AMEND. FRANKLY THAT WAS SOME OF THE TOUGHEST FIGHTING THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HISTORIANS KNOW SOME OF THE TOUGHEST FIGHTING. IN WORLD WAR. TWO IN ITALY. WITH THAT ARMY. BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT BY TALKING TO SENATOR BOB PRESLEY. I NEVER DID IN ALL THE YEARS. THAT I KNEW IN. HE WAS A MAN OF DISTINCT GRAYSON HUMILITY A MAN OF COURAGE. AND A MAN OF DECENCY. YOU KNOW DURING HIS TIME IN THE SENATE HE WORKED ACTUALLY WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE. TO GET STUFF DONE SORT OF A NOVEL CONCEPT THESE DAYS. OUR YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO HE WAS ON THE TICKET AS BOTH THE DEMOCRATIC AND THE REPUBLICAN. NOMINEE AND CANDIDATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. AND AFTER SEARCHING OUR STATE ARCHIVES OUR CURRENT SECRETARY OF STATE [inaudible] HAS CONFIRMED. BUT HE'S THE ONLY POLITICIAN. IN MODERN HISTORY TO HAVE DONE SO. NEEDLESS TO SAY SENATOR BOB PRESLEY WON THAT RACE. IN ADDITION TO HIS WORK IN PUBLIC SAFETY WHICH MY COLLEAGUE IS HIGHLY HIGHLIGHTED. IN SOME DETAIL. YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT BOB PRESLEY FOUGHT. FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ABUSE ESTABLISHING SHELTERS AND RESOURCES. AROUND THE STATE TO HELP WOMEN AND CHILDREN IMPACTED. BY THOSE HEINOUS CRIMES. AND TOGETHER WITH FORMER ASSEMBLYMAN THEN LATER CONGRESSMAN JERRY LEWIS. HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN DAY SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. LEADING [inaudible] TO CLEAN AIR. IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE CLEANER. THAT WE MOSTLY ENJOY. TODAY HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STATE AND HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR NATION WILL BE FELT FOR GENERATIONS. FOR MAKING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS SAFER TO THE AIR WE BREATHE CLEANER. TO OUR POLITICS MORE COMPASSIONATE AND DIGNIFIED. IN MY VIEW. HE WAS ONE OF THE FINEST PUBLIC SERVANTS CALIFORNIA WILL PROBABLY. EVER SEE. NOW I FIRST MET. BOB PRESLEY IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FORTY YEARS AGO. I WAS A YOUNG AIR FORCE CAPTAIN IN THOSE DAYS WORKING FOR A LIEUTENANT COLONEL BOB BOSS AT MARCH AIR FORCE BASE. AND ' AYE CENTER PRESS THE WITH THE BILL.

BOB PRESLEY INVITED OBVIOUSLY MY BOSS BUT ALSO INVITED ME TO COME TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE TO TESTIFY IS THAT YOUNG CAPTAIN. YOU KNOW I BEGGED OFF. FRANKLY THE THOUGHT OF COMING TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. INTIMIDATED ME. FUNNY HOW THINGS WORK OUT. OVER THE YEARS HE BECAME A MENTOR TO ME WE SERVED ON COMMUNITY BOARDS AND ADVOCACY GROUPS TOGETHER. AND HE WAS ONE OF FRANKLY TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WHO CONVINCED ME TO RUN FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OF FOLLOWING REDISTRICTING. AND HE CONTINUED TO CHEER AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY WOULD DO I MET HIM. FOR LUNCH ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AFTER COMING UP HERE AND HE CONTINUED TO CHEER ME ON AFTER THAT TO ENCOURAGE ME TO TALK ABOUT WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE EVEN IN THIS POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. AND HOW BENEFICIAL IT WAS BOTH TO HIS CAREER AND TO THE RESIDENTS OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY SENATOR BOB PRESLEY GAVE MY WIFE CINDY HER FIRST JOB. AT AGE SEVENTEEN IN HIS CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE DISTRICT OFFICE IN RIVERSIDE CALIFORNIA AND CONTINUED TO MENTOR HER AND GUIDE HER IN HER CAREER FOR AS LONG AS HE LIVED.
