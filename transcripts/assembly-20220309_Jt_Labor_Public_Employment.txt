I BELIEVE HE LEFT SO GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR FIRST PANEL. THAT COULD BE THE ACTUAL ADVISORY PANEL. THEIR FIRST FIGURES- DAVID TOMORROW A DEPUTY ASSISTANT ACTUARY CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE THAT YOU HAVE A SLIDE DECK APPOINTMENT SURE. PERFECT YOU SHOULD ALWAYS SEE THAT RIGHT NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO I AND I'M DAVID LETTERMAN AND MEMBER OF THE I NEED THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY TELLS THE TRUTH BUT I'M REALLY HERE TODAY AS THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY BUYS A WEEK PANEL. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE ON THE PANEL IN THAT CAP THE CAP WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT BY- SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY THREE. WE ARE AN EIGHT MEMBER PANEL HOUSE IN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AT PRESENT THE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION SEVENTY FIVE OR SEVEN POINT TWO THE PANEL SHALL PROVIDE IMPARTIAL INDEPENDENT INFORMATION ON PENSIONS AND OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND BEST PRACTICES. TO PUBLIC AGENCIES. FAT EVERY MEMBER OF THE PANEL IS A- BY ENTITY. AND CALLOUS TOWARDS REPRESENTATIVES ON A CAT. I HAVE LISTED HERE ALL OF THE ENTITIES AND INCLUDED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE AND HIDE A HYPERLINK. IF YOU WANTED TO SEE WHO THE EIGHT ANIL MEMBERS ARE- EACH PANELS YOU GENERALLY SERVES A TERM OF THREE YEARS. FIVE SO THE CABINS WE'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR SEVERAL YEARS ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS FOR ACTUAL WORK IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OVER THE YEARS YOU SHOULD SEVERAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS IN THE MAIL WHEN I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE FIRST ONE IS THIS IS A GUIDANCE ON SOMETHING POLICIES FOR PENSION PLANS AND OPEN IT IN CALIFORNIA AND SINCE WE HAVE ISSUED A DOCUMENT IN CALIFORNIA ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO IT HAS BEEN ADOPTED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. BY THE- CONFERENCES CAN ACTIVITIES SO THOSE DOCUMENTS HAVE INCLUDED THE HYPERLINK HERE ARE AVAILABLE ON THE CAP WEBSITE IS- DARN CODE SECTION TWO ZERO TWO TWO NINE. THE DATA SECTION CODE REQUIRES CALTRANS ADELIE PROVIDE CERTAIN INFORMATION RELATED TO PENSION COSTS FOR STATE EMPLOYEES SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES CALPERS TO DISCLOSE AND WILL LEAD THE LIABILITIES AND CONTRIBUTION RATES FOR THE STATE EMPLOYEES. F. ONTO AN INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTION THAT IS 2% HIGHER AND 2% LOWER THAN CURRENTLY ISSUE. AND IT ALSO REQUIRES CALPERS TO DISCLOSE WHAT THE CONTRIBUTION RATES WOULD BE FOR THE STATE PLANS IF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY WAS PAID DOWN OVER A PERIOD CALLED THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD. THIS IS BASICALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE EMPLOYEES TODAY HOW MANY YEARS ARE THEY EXPECTED TO WORK ON AVERAGE FOR THE STATE THAT'S WHAT THE LAW SAYS THAT CALPERS IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE AND ALSO RELATED CALPERS AS SATISFIED THIS REQUIREMENT EVERY SINGLE. YEAR SINCE IT'S BEEN ADDED TO STATUTE. NO NOT A ROLE TODAY IS LOOK AT GOVERNMENT SIX TWO DO NOT. IT REQUIRES A- FROM THE CATS. TO COME TO THIS JOINT HEARING AND EXPLAIN THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTION. AND THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD IN THE CALCULATION THE CONSTITUTION WHICH- TO DESCRIBE THE CONSEQUENCES TO FUTURE STATE BUDGETS IF THE INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTION IS NOT RELIANCE. AND TO ALSO REPORT WAITER THE CALPERS BOARD SUMMER TRANSITION PERIOD EXCEEDED. THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE. EMPLOYEES COVERED BY THE CONSTITUTION THAT'S WHAT SECTION TWO OH TWO TWO NINE SIX. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT FIRST THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTIONS SO. I LIKE THIS PICTURE BECAUSE YOU THINK ABOUT. HOW YOU FUND PENSION BENEFITS A PENSION PLAN WILL FIRST CONNECT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM MEMBERS AND EMPLOYERS AND THEN THE- MISSIONS ARE INVESTORS. AND INVESTMENT RETURN THAT YOU. TURN ON KINDS IN SIX IN AND ALL I BEHIND SON BENCH FUNDS IS TO OVERTIME- OVER THE LONG TERM TO TRY TO KEEP THIS IMBALANCE YOU CAN KIND OF SEE IF INVESTMENT RETURNS END UP BEING LESS THAN EXPECTED OR LOWER. THEN THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THIS AND TWO BALANCES BY COLLECTING MORE CONTRIBUTIONS AND VICE VERSA IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE HIGHER THAN CONTRIBUTIONS CAN BE REDUCED. JUST TO HELP YOU SEE HOW IMPORTANT INVESTMENT BECOMES ARTS YOU LOOK AT MOST PENSION FUND IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU ASK YOURSELF. FOR EVERY DOLLAR IN BENEFITS IF HE PAID TODAY HOW MUCH COMES FROM INVESTMENT RETURNS IF YOU LOOK AT MOST PENSION FUNDS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ANSWER IS GOING TO BE AROUND. SIXTY CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR. BUT SO SINCE. RETURN IS WHO AT INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTION WHAT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU IT'S JUST IT'S A SERVICE THAT'S RELEASED EVERY YEAR. BY NASA AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE RETIREMENT ADMINISTRATORS IT'S A BASIC CHART. BUT ALL I WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON IS THAT MIDDLE MINDED MEDIA. THIS SHOWS YOU FOR EVERY PUBLIC LANDS IN THE UNITED STATES. WHAT WAS THERE AS SOON INVESTMENT RETURNS FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND ALL I WANNA HIGHLIGHT HERE IS HOW IT HAS. CHANGED OVER TIME. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE DIDN'T MEDIA WAS 8% AND IF YOU LOOK IN CALIFORNIA AT THAT TIME YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT MOST PUBLIC PLANS IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ASSUMING AROUND 8% AS THEIR INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTION. FAST FORWARDING TO TODAY THE MEDIAN IS NOW 7% IN THE UNITED STATES AND IF YOU LOOK IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN. YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT THAT MOST PUBLIC PLANS ALL EITHER USING SEVEN PERCENT. OR SOMETHING MORE TALK TODAY. LAST NIGHT. DEKALB BOARD REVIEW ITS INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTION AND MADE A DECISION TO LOWER RATES FROM SEVEN TO SIX POINT 8% NOW WHAT THAT MEANS IS NOW WHEN CHILD INDUSTRY WHICH ONE CALPERS WILL. AN ISSUE. IN OUR AT S. AS THEIR FUNDING LEVELS. THEIR FUNDED STATUS AND DETERMINE THE CONTRIBUTION RATES THEY'RE GOING TO ISSUE ON THAT WHERE THE LONG TERM THEY ARE GOING TO EARN SIX POINT 8% ON THEIR INVESTMENTS NOW WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF. CALPERS WORK TO EARN LESS THAN SIX POINT EIGHT PERCENT. IN FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE GONNA HAVE TO BE HIGHER THAN WHAT CALPERS IS CURRENTLY PROJECTING AND VICE VERSA IF CALPERS IS ABLE TO EARN MORE THAN SIX POINT EIGHT PERCENT. IN FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE LOWER THAN WHAT CALPERS IS CURRENTLY PROJECTING SO- AND THAT IS FOR EVERY PENSION FUND IF THEY ARE ON MORNING WOULD BE. OR CALL. WILL BE ABLE TO LOWERED AND VERSA. BUT CALPERS DID A CURRENTLY ASSUMES POINT EIGHT PER. NOW THE I'M ALSO SUPPOSED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE ADVERTISING SHOULD BE- THEN WHEN YOU HEAR OUR TAXATION PERIOD JUST THINK ABOUT. AS AN INDIVIDUAL YOU'RE TRYING TO GO GET A MORTGAGE AND- YOU HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN MOST OF THE TIME BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND THIRTY YEARS SO. CALPERS AT JUST A FEW YEARS AGO AND MADE THE DECISION BARE BOARDS VOTED TO LOWER THEIR AMORTIZE ASIANS. FROM WHAT USED TO BE A THIRTY YEAR AMORTIZATION. TO NOW A TWENTY YEAR AMORTIZATION. UNFUNDED LIABILITY AT THAT CHANGE BECAME EFFECTIVE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND AGAIN IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT I'M ORGANIZATION HERE THAN YOU. THINK ABOUT A MORTGAGE THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES. HERE WHEN EIGHTY. WHEN IT SIX ADOPTS H. PERIOD TO PAY DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY IT'S REALLY MEANS HARDCORE. IN A SHORT TERM BUT LOBO TOTAL LONGER YOU PAY LESS IN INTEREST THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD DO IF YOU PICK A FIFTEEN YEAR MORTGAGE VERSUS THE THIRTY YEAR MORTGAGE IT ALSO MEANS THAT CURRENT TAXPAYERS WOULD PAY MORE TO WORK THE CURRENT UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND LONGER BEARD SAME THING WOULD HAVE LOWER CONTRIBUTION RATES WOULD YOU PAY THEM FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. WHICH MEANS HIRING TOOL COSTS OVER THE LONG TERM. AND IN THIS CASE IT WILL NEED TO BAXTER'S WILL PAY MORE. TO WORK CURRENT UNFUNDED LIKE. NOW WHAT OF THE TEAMS. TO YOU ASK GOVERNMENT JOBS TO GO TO NINE IT IS. S. DOES THE CALPERS AMORTIZATION EXCEEDED THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE BEER FOR STATE EMPLOYEES. SO F YOU LOOK AT THOSE STATE EMPLOYEES AND THAT'S FIVE PLANS THAT CALPERS ADMINISTERS. THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD ALL OF THESE RANGES BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE WEEK TWELVE YEARS SO. AND THAT'S BASED ON THE CURRENT DEMOGRAPHICS OF THOSE PLANS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS BASICALLY ON AVERAGE STATE EMPLOYEES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THE STATE FOR ABOUT ELEVEN TO TWELVE. NOW SINCE CALGARY'S AS A NOW THAT. AMORTIZED ISN'T YOU ON STANDARD LIABILITY OVER A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD THEN THE ADVERTISER THE U. S. TODAY DOES IT EXCEED. THIS AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD BUT WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT. IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A BAD THING. IN FACT IF YOU REFER BACK TO THAT GUIDANCE DOCUMENT THAT I MENTIONED. EARLIER ON SIGNING POLICIES. IN THAT DOCUMENT AS THE CAT WE'VE PROVIDED A RANGE OF WHAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE A MODEL PRACTICE A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE WHEN IT COMES TO AMORTIZE ASIANS BEARD. AND WHAT DID CAP STATED IT IS ANYWHERE BETWEEN SIXTY TO TWENTY YEAR SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A AS A MODEL PRACTICE SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT CALPERS DOES NOW WITH ADVERTISING THEIR NEW ONES ON THE LINE BUILT OVER TWENTY YEARS. IT'S RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE MODEL TRACTORS ISSUED. BY THE CAT. SO FOR THE CAL SPECIFIC IN FROM THAT IS REQUIRED SECTION TWO OH TWO TWO NINE IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF INFORMATION IT'S A LOT OF NUMBERS. BECAUSE OF WHAT'S REQUIRED TO BE CALCULATED AND DISCLOSED THE- CALPERS HAS BEEN PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION EVERY YEAR. THROUGH THEIR- WOULD. THE ACTUAL EVALUATION OF THE STATE THE MOST RECENT REPORT THAT'S AVAILABLE IS THE JUNE THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ACTUAL VALUATION WHICH WAS ISSUED LAST FALL. WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THIS WAS ISSUED BEFORE THE CALPERS BOARD LOWERED THEIR INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTIONS THAT THIS IS STILL BASED. ON THE PRIOR S. HUMAN BREAST AND RETURN OF 7% BUT THE INFORMATION IS QUITE LENGTHY IT'S ON. PAGES FORTY SIX THROUGH FIFTY SIX OF THE REPORT I'VE BEEN QUOTED A HYPERLINK HERE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WAS NOT PLANNING TO GO TO ALL OF THE INFORMATION TODAY BECAUSE THERE ARE. A LOT OF NUMBERS AND THE REPORT COVERS ALL THE DISH SIDE PLANS FOR WHICH THAT THE- THE CALPERS ADMINISTERS IT'S JUST TAKING A SLANG ESTATE INDUSTRIAL STATES AT STATE POLICE OFFICERS AND FIRE AND CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. SO THAT'S WHAT. I WANTED TO COVER TODAY. TO ENSURE THE CALL. THAT WAS ASKED AT BEGINNING- WITH RESPECT TO. ON LIABILITY OFTEN HEAR ABOUT SOME OF THE ABOUT THE PENSION SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA FISHY CALPERS AND CALSTRS TEND TO MAKE A NEW OFFER. THAT WHAT I'D LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE IS. TO YOU KNOW PEOPLE START TO PANIC BECAUSE THEY ARE LARGE NUMBER MOSTLY BECAUSE CALPERS AND DANCERS ARE TWO OF THE LARGEST PENSION FUND IN THE WORLD. WHAT IS IT THE WAY TO VIEW AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY WHEN YOU HEAR THAT THE- HELPERS AS AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY- IT'S SIMPLY TO SEE ANYTIME A PLAN AS ANNOUNCED ON THE LIABILITY. IT'S MORE YOU CAN VIEW IT AS TO WHAT IS THE PLAN ON SCHEDULE YES OR NO USUALLY UNFUNDED LIABILITY NEEDS YOU PROBABLY FIND IT A LITTLE BIT BEHIND YOUR. SCHEDULE TO- TO BE A HUNDRED FUNDED WE ALSO WHAT YOU SHOULD REALLY WATCH WHEN YOU SEE A PLAN. IS BELOW A 100% FUNDED AND HAS AN ON STANDARD LIABILITY WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST CRITICAL IS TO FIRST FIND OUT. DOES THAT PLAN HAD A IS THERE A PLAN IN PLACE TO ACHIEVE FULL FUNDING AND ELIMINATE THIS SOME SORT OF LIABILITY OVER A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S REALLY WHAT IS CRITICAL HERE. I CALPERS. DEARBORN IS ADOPTED AT TWENTY YEAR AMORTIZATION- IT'S A BEAR GOAL THIS FOR ANY NEW UNFUNDED LIABILITY. TO ELIMINATED OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS WHICH IS A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME I I'VE TELLS JURORS WE HAVE ACCOUNTS RESPONDING PLAN IN PLACE. WHICH ARE CEO AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT MORE LATER WHEN SHE DOES OUR PRESENTATION BUT THAT'S WHAT HE DID. THE KEY FOR ANY PENSION FUND WHEN YOU HAVE AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY AS ALWAYS HE HAD A PLAN IN PLACE IN THE NATIVE OVER REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME. YOU ARE IN GREAT SHAPE. SO THIS IS ALL I TO CALL TODAY HAPPY ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS. ANY MEMBERS MAY. ON JUST PENSION IN GENERAL IN JELLICO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MR LAMBRO. OF NO WILL TURN TO MEMBERS OF THE TWO COMMITTEES PRESENT- ANY QUESTIONS. YES SIR SOME OF OUR RECORDS. THE QUESTION IS DURING COVERT WE'VE SEEN THE OCCURRENCE OF WHAT THEY REFER TO AS THE GREAT RESIGNATION THROUGHOUT OUR ECONOMY A LOT OF PEOPLE OPTING TO RETIRE- HAVE WE SEEN ANYTHING JUST SORT OF BEEN THE CURVE AS AFFECTING STATE EMPLOYEES- SUCH THAT THEY SORT OF NOTED CHANGING YOUR UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS. ABOUT AMORTIZATION WORK FORCE OF SORTS OF ISSUES. DID YOU GET THE MISERABLE YES I DID GET THE QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO I WILL NOT RESIGN THIS ONE I'LL GIVE YOU MORE OF A GENERAL ANSWER IT THERE SHOULD BE SPECIFIC TO CALPERS SINCE I WORK AT CALENDARS AS YOU KNOW EVERY PENSION FUND AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING THE SAME ACCOUNTS AS WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING THE DEMOGRAPHIC BEHAVIORS OF OUR MEMBERS. THROUGH CODED WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS THAT GENERALLY ACTUARIES AND PENSION FUND WILL AT EVERY FEW YEARS PERFORM A IF YOU WANT AN IN DEPTH REVIEW OF DEMOGRAPHIC BEHAVIORS BY THEIR MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY KEEP ANY PENSION SIGN WHEN YOU TRY TO. FUND RETIREMENT BENEFITS IS TO ENSURE THAT THE ACTROS SOME SHINS THAT YOU USE AT THE FUNDING OF THE SYSTEM. OUR REFLECTION OF REALITY AND HOW. HE HATES SO I SAID CALISTO WAS WE HAD BEEN WATCHING. CLOSELY HOW. B. AS IN OUR- WE DID SEE. INCREASED WITH AT THAT TIME OR- IN THE EARLY DAYS OF SCHOOL THIS STAY. SINCE SO FOR US I KNOW WE FUNDING PENSION BENEFITS IT'S MORE ABOUT I THINK IT'S NORMAL TO SEE- WHAT I WOULD CALL SHORT TERM FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMOGRAPHIC BEHAVIOR IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELVES- FOR THAT WHEN YOU FIND RETIREMENT BENEFITS IT HAD THESE. ARE THESE CHANGES GOING TO BE STAY FOR THE LONG TERM AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO TELL NOW THAT SINCE WE'RE STILL IN THE KOBE AT THE END. BUT I THINK MOST SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND IF NEEDED MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS AND RESPONDING IN THEIR SYSTEM. I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU. YES ANYBODY ELSE. WITH QUESTIONS LET ME JUST SAY I SAID I SUSPECT- IT'S A SIMILAR ANSWER IT IT- THROUGH AMBER WELL I ALSO HAVE YOU WORKED ON IT SERVED ON ON LOCAL- PENSION BOARDS RETIREMENT BOARDS I KNOW THAT THE WORK THAT YOU DO IS NOT. SUSPECT- TO SHORT TERM PARKING FLUCTUATIONS OR- ARE GREATLY IMPACTED BY THAT- INFLATION I MENTION THAT MY OPENING COMMENTS- INFLATION IS OBVIOUSLY UPON US- WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL BE HERE IT'S CERTAINLY- WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO BE AROUND LONG TERM RELATIVE TO ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS- THAT YOU'RE MAKING- BUT I DON'T WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR YOU- DOES THAT- IT IS THAT IF THEY CREATE ANY PARTICULAR CHANGE IN IN THE WAY YOU APPROACH YOUR WORK. BECAUSE THE ANSWER IS NO IT IS SOMETHING THAT- THE CALL AND I THINK ALL ACTUALLY SOME MONITORING RATE SINCE INFLATION HAS BEEN. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE HIGHEST WHICH SENIOR THE UNITED STATES FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS AT. TODAY'S DAY I THINK WHAT WHAT ACTUALLY IS PAID MORE ATTENTION TO IS WHAT IS THE LONG TERM EXPECTATIONS AND AS YOU SAID. THIS EVEN THOUGH INFLATION HAS BEEN PRETTY HIGHLY IT HAS. NOT YET SHIFTED I THINK MOST ECONOMISTS STILL EXPECT FROM DEMONSTRATION TO BE IN THE TWO AND A HALF PERCENT RANGE. BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT- I THINK ALL ACTORS ON MONITORING RIGHT NOW IN YOUR CORRECT WELL AND YOU WILL NOT SEE. THAT YOUNG YOU'RE NOT LIKELY TO SEE. CHANGES IN THE SHORT TERM IN REACTION TO THIS HIGH INFLATION BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEING. MONITORED AS WE DO WAIT WAIT ALL ACTUAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO THIS SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING. TO THAT I THINK THAT'S IT- THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENT FOR B. HERE- WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER IMAGES INSERT HERE FOR THOSE- I THINK WE HAVE SOME. FOLKS HERE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE GALLERY AND ON THE SHOW WE WILL HAVE SOME. THROUGH THE MODERATOR LATER WE WILL TAKE ALL PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF OUR FOUR PRESENTATIONS SO. I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR EXPECTATIONS SHOULD BE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM. OR CALPERS MS MARCY FROST MISTRUSTING HIM FOR BEING HERE WITH US TODAY AND- LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION. GOOD MORNING TERAKHIR TELL C. H. R. COOPER AND MEMBERS OF THE TWO COMMITTEES. I WAS VERY HAPPY TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN UPDATE ON. ALL THINGS COUNTERS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DO HAVE A PACKAGE- THE PRESENTATION THAT I SENT IN ADVANCE AND- ON YOUR- WORKSTATION. SO IF WE GO TO SLIDE TO. JUST MAKE A FEW POINTS AND I WILL ADDRESS. SURE KEEPER FLESH THAT HE AND HIS INTRODUCTION. SO IF WE LOOK AT THE LAST FIVE YEAR PERIOD WHICH I THINK IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN FROM. THE CALPERS FINANCIAL STREET HAS IMPROVED AND MUCH OF THAT IS WHAT DAVID LAMB OR OKAY WITH THE KID IN HIS PRESENTATION JUST BEFORE ME. AND BIT THE FUNDED STATUS OR WHAT WE CALL THE COVERAGE RATIO WHICH IS MOVING THE AVAILABLE ASSETS ON HAND TO TAKE THE FUTURE PENSION PAYMENTS ARE. THE TOP RIGHT OF THE SYSTEM. FIVE YEARS AGO THAT NUMBER SAT AT ROUGHLY 6566% AND YOU FAST FORWARD BACK TO JUNE THIRTIETH OF LAST YEAR BETWEEN ONE POINT 3% RETURN THE CALPERS WAS ABLE TO GET. AND THAT NUMBER NOW SITS AT EIGHTY PERCENT. 80% IS STILL NOT OBVIOUSLY BUT WE WANT TO BE WANT TO BE CLOSER TO THAT HAD A PERCENT MARKET AS MUCH AS WE CAN. I'M IN WHAT THAT WAS REALLY NEAT AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE SIX HUNDRED BILLION IN THE PORTFOLIO IF WE WOULD HAVE A 100% COVERAGE RATIO OR A MARKER IT'S A MARKER THAT I'M ONE MEMBER STATE ACROSS ITS ENGINE TO OUR RETIREES. IT PLEASANT AND GINGER AND IT REALLY IS AN INDICATOR. OF A PUBLIC PENSION PLANS HELLO. SO OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE. WITH MITIGATION BACK IN THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE BOARD REALLY FIVE ABOUT. I DRIED RATES A PRIME. WAYS TO BE OVER PORTFOLIO WITH MEETING HADN'T FUNDS BENEFITS OVER. TO COME. AVOIDING ANY OF THE- AND SHORT TERM IS ON. I THINK IF. USING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO. YOU HAVE TO ELEVEN I. REMAIN IN AND MANY OF PLAN BUT YOU KNOW WOULD WORKING. TWO FIVE THIRTY YEARS SO. OUR EVER GO. AND IMPLANTS ARE. BENEFITS FOR. AND WE HAVE THINK ABOUT QUOTE. AND SAME WAY. I SAW FOR THE BOY. AND FOR THE- OFFICE WITH MEETINGS. AROUND DRIVE. RATES BECAME- PRETTY IMPORTANT I SINCE LEARNED CERTAINLY OF THE- ONLY ONLINE FINANCIAL. AND SO WHAT WE DID. WE PUT UP WITH ME. POLICY IN PLACE THAT THESE. SAID IT'S- HERE ZERO OF RETURN. THAT HE IS. GREATER RETURN OF THE DISCOUNT RATE ON THAT LIABILITIES FROM LIABILITIES ALSO. AT THE SAME TIME. SO THE SEVEN. AND WAS DECREASED SIX POINT EIGHT WHAT IS DONE THROUGH THAT RISK MITIGATION POLICY THAT WAS PUT INTO EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. AND SOME OF THAT IS TO HELP US WITH THAT YOU KNOW THE- WE HAVE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS AND WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THEIR BUDGETS. ARE QUITE STRANGE YOU HEAR FROM THEM EITHER WITH THE BASES WE NEED WITH THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND CONTRIBUTION RATES AS A DAVIS PRESENTATION HI SEAN. YOU PUT A CONTRIBUTION RATES AS WELL AS INVESTMENT RETURNS WILL NEED TO LOOK AT THE BOOK OUT THE PENSION CAME. IS GIVEN TO A RETIREE. SO LAST NOVEMBER I AM FOUR YEARS AGO WHAT THE COMPANY ASSET MY- NOW. SITE IN. AT THE BORDER THE NEW STRUCTURE ASSET ALLOCATION. THAT ALLOCATES MORE TO THE PRIVATE MARKETS PRIVATE EQUITY. REAL ASSETS AND THEY ALSO DID A 5% ALLOCATION TO PRIVATE THAT STRATEGY. AND I ALSO ADDED SOME LEVERAGE AT THE TOTAL FUN LEVEL. IS LEVERAGING THE ASSET CLASS LEVEL IN THE PAST JUST LIKE MOST OF THE PENSION PLANS BUT THE BOARD WANTED TO MONITOR THIS A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY AND SO THEY PUT IT AT THE ASSET ALLOCATION LEVEL. AND JACK TO GET A BIT MORE TRANSPARENCY AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE WOULD NOT BE HIS. TIMING IS EVERYTHING WAS YOU KNOW ON ON LOSING LEVERAGE LEVELS BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT THAT. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE END. OF MY JOB. AND ALSO ADDRESSING A SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS WE REALLY HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM E. S. AND G. AND REALLY. PUT THAT INTO THIS PRODUCT CATEGORY AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. I DIDN'T BUY JEANS ADDRESS RIGHT HERE WITH ME TODAY. I HE IS OUR INTERIM MANAGING INVESTMENT DIRECTOR FOR SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS IN GOVERNANCE AND HE IS- HE REPLACED AND SIMPSON. WHO LEFT THIS MONTH MORE RECENTLY. AND THEN SOMETHING I THINK THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION AS PART OF ITS HAVING SUSTAINED OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN CUSTOMER EXCELLENCE RELATED TO. YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY WHAT TIME IN THE HOSPITAL ON THE WEDNESDAY AND THEN EVERYONE FULL TIME REMOTE WORKING VERY NEXT DAY. OUR IT SYSTEMS ARE SECURITY SYSTEMS OUR CUSTOMER. SYSTEMS ALL HAVE WORKED EXTREMELY WELL WITH MARKEDLY WELL OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND LAST WEEK WE GET RETURN ARE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED EMPLOYEES RE OPENED A REGIONAL LOCATIONS AND TO ADD THAT IT'S GOING QUITE WELL RIGHT. I SEE MOSTLY. AND MOST OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE WORKING IN THE HYBRID MODEL WHERE THERE THREE DAYS IN THE OFFICE AND TWO DAYS FROM NOW. WE HAD MADE OUR ENTIRE CONTACT CENTER BE AVAILABLE FOR FULL TIME OR NOT WOULD CONTINUE TO OFFER TO OUR MEMBERS ARE TWO MILLION MEMBERS AROUND. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND. HI PENSION PAYMENTS MOST OF THAT IS. EIGHT TO INDIVIDUALS WHO CONTINUE TO RESIDE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CLOSE 290% OF THOSE PENSION PAYMENTS. AVERAGE MONTHLY ALLOWANCE FOR ALL THE TIMES AND- ITS NUMBERS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE OFTEN HEAR CRITIQUES THAT NEEDS PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ARE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN RETIREMENT. AT THE AVERAGE AMOUNT IS AROUND THIRTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND I BROUGHT THE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES INTO THAT NUMBER IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THIS ONE POINT AVERAGE THAT NUMBER COMES DOWN. QUITE CONSIDERABLY. FOR ALL NEW RETIREES WHO ARE NOW RETURNING OUT OF THE SYSTEM OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THAT NUMBER INCREASED TO THIRTY SEVEN NINETY THREE AND 33% OF OUR MEMBERS. ADDITIONAL MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS. OR DO NOT USE SOCIAL SECURITY. I WILL MEMBERS ARE ARE GOING TO. APPELLATION TO BE HONEST I FOUR HI AS A- JUNE THIRTIETH OF LAST YEAR THE BERKELEY SEVEN SEPARATE INSISTING BILLION THAT NUMBER WENT OVER THE FIVE HUNDRED BILLION AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND I HAVEN'T SEEN IN SOME OF THE VOLATILITY THAT WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN SEEING AND EXPERIENCING THAT NUMBER HAS COME BACK DOWN AND AGAIN JUST A REMINDER OF THE FUNDED STATUS AT 80% WHICH IS. IN A BETTER PLACE CERTAINLY NINETEEN NOT 6566% AT THAT TIME WHAT WE'RE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IS AND NOT AS WELL OKAY 50% MARKER AND THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR A PUBLIC PLAN OF OUR SIZE LIABILITIES WE HAVE TO FULLY RECOVER FROM THAT SO AGAIN ANOTHER REASON WHY THAT PRESENTATION AT POLICY AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES WERE PUT IN PLACE AND THEN A TWENTY ONE POINT THREE I NEVER. TURNED ON ON INVESTMENTS. I'M GOING TO CITE IF YOU LOOK AT THE LONG TERM. AGAIN FOR A LONG TERM AND THAT'S- A WEEK INTEND TRIPLE Y. TERM. YOU OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO LITTLE BETTER I. YOU KNOW ANALYSIS OF EACH. SHORT TERM DYNAMIC OF MEETING HAPPEN IN ON THE- BUT ESSENTIALLY OTHER THAN THE- EIGHT OH NINE I PARTY INTO CRISIS. EVERY TIME PERIOD SPANS IN EXCESS OF THE ASSUMED RATE OF RETURN TODAY AT SIX POINT EIGHT. IT WAS AT SEVEN POINT FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUT HAS BEEN COMING DOWN. TO WHERE IT COUNTS SINCE ABOUT SIX POINT EIGHT. I COMING TO. AN OPPORTUNE ON SIX INVESTMENT RISK. YES THERE'S A LOT OF RISK IN THE PORTFOLIO THERE'S REALLY NOWHERE TO HIDE FROM NOT TIGER WOODS NEW INSPECTIONS THAT'S POINT 8% ON. ON ON YOUR MONEY. I SUSTAINABILITY BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM AT THE ABILITY FOR OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO CONTINUE TO AFFORD. AFRICANS PUBLIC EMPLOYEE BENEFITS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS. AND OUR CONSULTANT FOR AND OBVIOUSLY WANT TO CONTINUE TO OFFER THIS IS FOR THE RECORD. RETENTION IT'S I. HELPS WITH THAT TOTAL COMPENSATION OF BEING A PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT SOMETIMES SILENCE AND A LACK. IT TYPICALLY EMPLOYEE BENEFITS FOR HOW YOU BALANCE OUT THAT EQUATION YOU NEED TO RECRUIT FOR TOP TALENT. AND THEN- EXCEPTIONAL HEALTH CARE WE ARE THE SECOND LARGEST IMPORTER PURCHASER OF HEALTHCARE IN THE UNITED STATES JUST UNDER FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. OUR STRATEGY AND THEN OUR NEWLY RELEASED. ABOUT A YEAR AGO WHEN WE STARTED CURSING AT THE MEETING QUESTION FRAMEWORK. WHICH REALLY IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES AROUND THE REGIONAL EQUITY AUDIT. THIS WOULD GIVE YOU THAT SAME. FROM THE SAME FRAMEWORK OR THE SAME TYPES OF STRATEGIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK FORCE THE SUPPLIER DIVERSITY IN THE HEALTH CARE PLANS ALL ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF. THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO MOVE ON TO AN- READ. AND SO WHAT WE CAN DO OUR YEAR. PLAN BUILDING MANAGEMENT AND STAFF THE CAPITAL MARKETS. BASICALLY WE COULD TO EARN ON ON NINETY THREE- PUBLIC EQUITY IT WILL STAY. FOR STRUCTURE EXTENDS. BUT THERE'S NO. HAVE BEEN. OVER THE NEXT YEARS OF TIME. WELL YOU KNOW THAT WE HAD TO GO. SO AT SIX. TO GET OUT THAT 7% WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEW CAP MARKET ASSUMPTION THAT. WE IS 6% SO THEY CANDIDATE FOR. THAT WERE PRESENTED TO THE BOARD INCLUDING GOING UP NEXT CHAPTER AT 6% PER CALL IT SIXTY FIVE. SIX POINT FIVE SIX POINT SEVEN FIVE SIX ONE EIGHT AND THEN SEVEN. THE BOARD ULTIMATELY DECIDED ON THE SIX POINT EIGHT. BECAUSE OF THOSE LOWERING. CAPITAL MARKET ASSUMPTIONS INCREASE THE ALLOCATION TO PRIVATE ASSETS. AND REALLY PUSHED FOR TIME YOU KNOW HOW WE ENGAGE THE PUBLIC COMPANIES WILL TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE ENGAGING THE PRIVATE COMPANIES AS WELL. AND IT REALLY PUSHED US TO GET MORE INVOLVED AROUND- YOU KNOW CLIMBING AROUND THE PERSON YOU RECKON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES THAT ARE HAPPENING WITHIN. THE COMPANY'S WORK WHERE WE INVEST. SO ON TO ASK NINE. THAT IS COULD BE. WILL NOTICE OUR LAST HALF AN HOUR. OF IS APPROVED IN NOVEMBER PRIOR THAT HE HAD AN- TO. THE TO CATCH THAT WAY REMOVED BECAUSE OF THE- OUTLOOK DEMAND THAT'S HOW WITH OUR INVESTMENT THIS. I DID ALSO TO ON WHAT I CAN THE TOTAL. FOR IN THE PAST THERE WAS A LOT OF ASKED CLASS. APPROACH IN SOMETIMES THOSE ASSET CLASSES WERE COMPETING WITH ONE ANOTHER OR THEY WOULD CANCEL OUT A STRATEGY. IT'S A REALLY PUTTING AND- EVERYONE'S INCENTIVE PLANS AS WELL THAT WHEN THE TOTAL FUND AS WELL THEN THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT BRAND WILL BE SHARED WITH HIM THIS MONTH AND START LOOKING AT THAT. I TOLD MY MOTHER VERSUS JUST AGAIN ASK US TO LOOK AT THE FIXED INCOME. PRIVATE EQUITY. AND THEN I'M REAL ASSETS SINCE THE- YOU KNOW NINE POTENTIAL PRICES WELL IT'S BEEN A LONG. LONG JOURNEY HERE IS REALLY MOVING OUR REAL ASSETS STRATEGY AWAY FROM A GROWTH STRATEGY TO MORE OF AN- INCOME BASED STRATEGY. AND AT THAT PARTICULAR PORTFOLIO HAS TWENTY PERCENT. IN THE MOBILE ENERGY STORAGE. IN THE PORTFOLIO SO THAT'S BEEN A- RECENT DEVELOPMENT I WOULD SAY WOULD LAST YEAR'S RECOGNITION BUSTED RECORDS AND RECORDS. I WATCHING. OVER THOSE PARTS FROM YESTERDAY. AND ON THE DEFENSIVE BACK PLEASE. I REALLY THIS MEAN I THINK FOR ALL OF NEW BAD. YOU KNOW TWENTY ONE THREE PER RETURN THAT NEED NOT LAST MORE COMPARE DATA BENCH MARK THAT TO ME OF OUR- YOU'LL SEE THAT NUMBER. YOU KNOW. LAST WE WERE TWENTY ONE THREE CLEARANCE WILL BE TO TWENTY FIVE AND SEVEN. THAT'S REALLY DOES DEPEND STRATEGY IN LIGHT. WE'RE ASKING BEFORE WHEN AROUND THREE PER. AND AT PORT WE SEVEN. THOSE DEFENSIVE STRATEGY ACTION STABLE ON DOWNSIDES OF. HOW ALL THE TEAMS FIRST MEETING- HOW MANY BASICALLY AFFECTIONATE ACROSS THE BOARD- SO NOW I'M GONNA TURN IT UP AGAIN AND VILLAGES WHERE A COUPLE OF THE SUSTAINABILITY SLIDES A MOMENT ME QUICKLY THROUGH THIS SO WE CAN GET SPARKED QUESTIONS. WE GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON SUSTAINABILITY OUR BOARD OF ADMINISTRATION DIRECTS OUR EFFORTS ON SUSTAINABILITY TO STOP THE POLICY. DOES INCLUDE TOTAL FUND INVESTMENT POLICY INVESTMENT BELIEFS GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIC PLANNING SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR LIABILITIES WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE LONG TERM. PLEASE MOVE TO SLIDE ELEVEN. HERE YOU SEE NOT THE NUMBER OF ITEMS AND WE ARE FOCUSED ON INSISTING ABILITY THEY INCLUDE RESEARCH THIS INCLUDES INTERNAL RESEARCH ALSO INCLUDES MAJOR INITIATIVES LIKE OUR SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT RESEARCH INITIATIVE WE ARE ON C. READ THREE WHICH WE WORK WITH AN ACADEMIC CONSULTANT AND WE'RE FOCUSED ON. CLIMATE RISK AS WELL AS HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. DATE IN COURT REPORTING IS IMPORTANT. THERE'S A HUGE GAP BETWEEN WHAT INVESTORS THE X. AND WHAT WE GET IN REGULATORY. DATA REPORTS SO WE ARE FOCUSED ON GETTING MORE OUT OF THE REGULATORS AND GETTING MORE FROM COMPANIES. WHEN IT COMES TO THE DATA THAT THEY PROVIDE. GIVEN THE ENHANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY WE BELIEVE THAT COMPANIES CAN PROVIDE AS MUCH MORE. AND GIVE IN THAT WOULD GIVE US A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GREAT ALLOCATION DECISIONS. AS YOU KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. CLIMATE RISK IT IS A PRIORITY FOR US AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. DIVERSITY INCLUSION AS WELL. WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR BECAUSE OF OUR POPULATION WE NEED TO GET THE MOST OF THE TALENTS OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE. WE CAN POINT IT AT. CHIEF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OFFICER AND WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL. D. I. FRAMEWORK. PRIVATE EQUITY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND WE ARE EXPANDING OUR PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND WE ARE FOCUSED ON ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY. IT IS SUBSTANTIAL THAT ARE PRIVATE EQUITY GROUP HAS LAUNCHED A VERY IMPORTANT INITIATIVE CALLED YES G. DATA CONVERGENCE PROJECT WITH A FOCUS ON NET HIRES EMPLOYEE FEEDBACK WORK INJURIES RENEWABLE ENERGY AND- GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. FINALLY THE MANAGER EXPECTATIONS NEEDS EXACTLY THAT WE EXPECT OUR MANAGERS TO DO WHAT WE DO. AND FOCUS ON WHAT WE WANT THEM TO FOCUS ON AND WE DO THAT BY SHARING OUR POLICIES. WITH THEM WE FOCUS ON THE FOUR STREAMS DOES OUR ADVOCACY ENGAGEMENT INTEGRATION AND PARTNERSHIPS. THE WORK WE DO IS BEST DONE THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS. IF YOU WANT TO GO FAST YOU GO ALONE BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR YOU MOVE WITH OTHERS IN THROUGH THIS IN ALL OF THESE EFFORTS WE FIND IT INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE WHEN WE WORK WITH PARTNERS. A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A BOOST TO SLIDE THIRTEEN. CONGRESS CONVENED AND CO FOUNDED CLIMATE CLIMATE ACTION ONE HUNDRED PLUS. IT CURRENTLY CONSISTS OF SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN FESTERS REPRESENTING SIXTY FIVE TRILLION IN ASSETS. IT IS THE WORLD'S FIFTY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT CORPORATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTERS. THOSE ARE RESPONSIBLE SIT ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE ORGANIZATION WE CULTURED THE H. ADVISORY GROUP AND WE BELIEVE THAT TWENTY TWO COMPANIES. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT. AMONG THESE COMPANIES ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN OF THEM. HAVE ME NET ZERO GOALS BY APER ON EXTERNALITIES AND COMMON OWNER OPINED THAT CLIMATE ACTION ONE HUNDRED PLUS CONSTITUTES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. PRIVATE ACTION ACTUALLY REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS FROM THIS I THINK IS IMPORTANT HIGHLIGHT THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE AND THAT IS WITH OCCIDENTAL. CALPERS LEADS ON THE ACCIDENTAL ENGAGEMENT. ACCIDENTAL WAS THE FIRST TO SET NET ZERO TARGETS. IN FACT IT IS VIEWED AS THE ONLY COMPANY THAT SETS TARGETS AMBITIOUS ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY MEET THE NET ZERO GOAL BY TWENTY FIFTY IN FACT THEY'VE SET THEIR GOAL. TO BE MET BY TWENTY FORTY NUMBER OF MEMES METHANE CAPTURE EFFICIENCY COGENERATION FLARING REDUCTION. EMISSION MITIGATION AND LOW CARBON PRODUCTION. I PROVIDE THESE DETAILS THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO AND WE'RE ABLE TO GET TO ONE BOOK THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS AND WE ACT AS AN ACTIVE OWNER OF THESE OF THESE PARTICULAR ASSETS. AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO MARCY AS I INDICATED EARLIER WE HAVE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND PUBLIC EMPLOYERS- COULD PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIPER SYSTEM AND WE SEE THEM AS KEEN TO RUNNING AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM THAT WE NEED TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO THEM WITH THE TOOLS THAT HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR BUDGETS APPROPRIATELY WE NEED TO GIVE THEM PRE FUNDING OPTIONS TO THINKING TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR SUPPORTING THESE TRUSTS AND ALLOWING US TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THOSE TO HELP OUT ALL OF OUR PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS. AND NO ONE FOR YEARS I THINK THAT AT THE HEIGHT ON THE SIDE BECAUSE WE HAD SOME YOU KNOW THERE ARE TWO REPUBLICAN FOUR YEARS EARLY ON THERE'S A LOT OF MEDIA COVERAGE WHERE I. WE HAD EMPLOYEES WHO WERE NOT OBTAINED THE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THEIR CURRENT ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND WE'RE NOT PAYING THE ASSOCIATED CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE RETIRED. AND SO- TODAY I WE HAVE NO EMPLOYERS WHO ARE DOING WHEN I'M IN RETENTION PAYMENTS ON THE ARE REPORTING ABOUT THE DATA. AND CONTRIBUTIONS TIME. IF YOU PROVIDE A COURT REPORT THE BOARD I. ONCE BOARD TO MAKE A DETERMINED. ON I GERMANY I'M IN HAPPENS WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. YEAH THE LITTLE BOY IN SEMESTER TIRE MEANS A LOT OF NOTICE AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD FROM SOME OF OUR- I INDIVIDUALS RETIREES WHO HAD SPENT THEIR PENSION PAYMENTS CUT BY SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. AND BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT NATURE AND BACKS. J. P. ACT. ON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE WE USED TO CALL ME HELP THAT TRIANGLE IT IS NOW MORE OF A QUIET A FULL CIRCLE AND WHAT WE GOT IN THERE IS REALLY HELP THAT THEY NEED THAT SO I WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A GLOBAL OUTCOMES FOR EVERY PURCHASE. WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE. MILLION PARTICIPANTS IN OUR HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS- WHAT WE'RE PURCHASING HEALTH CARE. SO NOT ONLY IS IT IMPORTANT INSTANT HIGH QUALITY IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE ACCEPTABLE. AND I DO HAVE A SLIDE WHERE I CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT JUST FOR THE RECORD TO SLIDE. TWENTY AND THIS IS AN AREA OVER THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS IT'S MORE IN LINE WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE PURCHASERS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WE'RE ALL BASICALLY RUNNING THE SAME TYPE OF OPERATIONS OF THE SAME TYPE. OF PURCHASING I'M IN. TIME TO SUPPLIERS OR THROUGH OUR TEENS AREN'T WORKING WITH THE SAME PLAN ALL THE GAMES SEEMS VERY SEPARATELY YEAH WE ALL ARE COVERING THE SAME TYPES OF SERVICES. AND SO- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAS BECOME EXTREMELY MORE IMPORTANCE AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN ON THE HEALTH SERVICES WITHIN SUFFERING. SO TRYING TO CHOLESTEROL TWO TO THREE TOP PRIORITIES FOR TOP PURCHASERS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE. CALPERS CALIFORNIA AND DEPARTMENT MANAGED HEALTHCARE GAUGE I SNACKS AND REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING THERE BUT WE SING ON THREE PRIMARY CHRONIC CONDITIONS OBVIOUSLY PHARMACEUTICALS ARE THE LARGEST PART AND SEND ALONG WITH INPATIENT. AND LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE OUTCOME OF THE WORK THAT'S. BEEN HAPPENING BY THIS COALITION. AND ON US. THE SITE IS NOT TO TWO WHICH IS OUR DIVERSITY AT AND FRAMEWORK AND WE'RE QUITE PROUD OF A SPRING TOGETHER THAT WE CAN'T ALL- WE INDEPENDENT WORK HOW ACROSS THE ORGANS AND WITH ABOUT SOME HELP WITH. KIND SUPPLIERS BUT THAT'S AN INVESTMENT THAT'S IN TALENT MANAGEMENT AND WE HIRE IN NINETEEN OF THE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED POINTS TO HAVE A CALPERS SO IT'S ALL BASED ON OUR FIVE CORE PRINCIPLES ONE WE CULTURED VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A CULTURE THAT IS. GETS THE BEST TALENT POSSIBLE THAT PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEIR CULTURE THAT PROMOTES ANNIKA TREATED FAIRLY BY THE LEADERSHIP AND THEY HAVE ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN GROW DEVELOP AND PROMOTE AND WE DO HAVE WAYS OF MEASURING EVERY ONE OF THESE FIVE COMPONENTS AND THEN ON THE TALENT MANAGEMENT SIDE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WORK HE NEEDS AND- WHAT'S THE BEST ANSWER THAT'S HEALTHCARE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE RIGHT TALENT IN THE DOOR. AND TALENT AGAIN THAT REPRESENTS THE DIVERSITY. HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EXACTLY I DID ABOUT THAT. SUPPLIER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IN EACH THAT WE A NEED TO. CONTRACT WITH A NEW TO FILL EIGHT FOR PART OF THE BASE THAT HAS SELECTED FOR OUTSIDE. THAT WE IN THAT WE TRY TO DIVERSE SENSE. TO CHOOSE FROM AND THEN ON INVESTMENTS HI JAMES MENTIONED THIS THIS IS ALL ABOUT MANAGER SELECTION. AT THE BASKET DURING ASSETS ARE MANAGED IN HOUSE AT CALPERS SO THAT TALENT MANAGEMENT AND RECRUITMENT. EQUALLY IMPORTANT IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE RUNNING OUR INVESTMENT PROGRAM THAT WE'RE- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE DIVERSITY AT THE TABLE WHEN DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE AROUND THE PARK. AND HE SEEMS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. IMPROVEMENTS THERE THERE WERE QUITE PROUD OF. SO IN. I WOULD HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY THAT LONG TERM. ASSISTANCE AND THE PENSION FUND PROMISE. STUDENTS AMONG THEM. I MOSTLY GETTING. THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY HEALTHCARE INCLUDING THE PUBLIC IMPORTANCE TO. IF THEY COME INTO. OUR HEALTH CARE PROGRAM THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE. HEALTHCARE SERVICES OR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. FOR THEIR RETIREES AS WELL. CONTINUING TO LOOK MEDICARE MEASURES TO REDUCE OUR OF BEGAN IT'S VERY TO HIDE FROM THE RISK. BECAUSE YOU RISK FREE RATES IS CERTAINLY NOT SIX POINT EIGHT. OUR FOCUS VERY MUCH SOMEONE WERE SERVICING AS WELL AS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS ON MEETING ANY OF OUR GOALS I KNEW I HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH LEGISLATORS ON VARIOUS FILM IDEAS FOR PROPOSALS. REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AREN'T SO I CAN. SURE I CAN GO. DIRECTLY ANSWER SOME OF. THAT CHECK OR ASK FOR YOU STRAIGHT BACK TO YOU FOR GENERAL QUESTIONS. HE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS ROSS- WANTED TO PLEASE- RESPONDED SURE COOPER'S QUESTIONS AND WE'LL SEE WHAT ELSE WE HAVE IF WE HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS WILL HAVE TO DO A BIT OF A LIGHTNING AROUND THE HOME. HE DID VERY WELL COVERING A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION- IN A IN A WITHIN THE EXPECTED PERIOD OF TIME BUT- WE'LL OUT ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES FOR Q. NA JUST TO SET EVERYONE'S EXPECTATIONS SO THANK YOU ALTERNATE BACK TO YOU- MISS ROSS QUESTION AND IT WAS REGARDING THE INVESTMENTS IN THE PORTFOLIO AND HOW MUCH HAS BEEN LOST BY THE SYSTEM'S EITHER IN ACTUAL INVESTMENT LOSSES OR AN OPPORTUNITY LESSONS- EITHER THROUGH SELF DIRECTED INVESTMENT OR LEGISLATED TO TAP MY DECIDED TO COMPEL THE VESTMENTS AND THE MOST RECENT REPORTS ARE THAT WE GET FROM BOETTCHER CONSULTANTS WHO DOES THE CALCULATION ON RECORDED THE BEST ONES IN THE SUSPENSE IS ABOUT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND LOST LOST OPPORTUNITY. OR THE COST OF THAT ACTUALLY MEANT A LOT OF THAT INCIDENT TO BACK THOSE ARE THE VAST MAJORITY NEEDS AND TOBACCO AT THIS POINT AND BUT I THINK IT'S SAFE WITH HIM THE WHOLE IDEA OF ENGAGEMENT OVER THE LAST NIGHT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE FIRMLY BELIEVE AND NEAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE INVESTOR THE BEST IN HIS WILLINGNESS ON THE ROOT CAUSES OF CARBON EMISSIONS. IT'S GOING TO TAKE- YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF THIS FIFTY FIVE TRILLION KIND ACTION ONE HUNDRED PLUS IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVERYONE DOING THIS INCLUDING GOVERNMENTS REGULATORS INVESTORS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING CALPERS AND CAL STAR SECIAL SPEECH SPEAKING FOR THEMSELVES STAND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN SOLVE INDEPENDENTLY AND JUST AS A REMINDER ON THE FOSSIL FUEL SITES ON WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING AND THE QUESTION AS WELL AS SAFE IF NOT 20% OF THE PORTFOLIO IS REALLY EXPANDS THERE IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OR GET INTO A CARBON NEUTRALITY PORTFOLIO. WHEN YOU THINK OF OTHER SECTORS THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR THE PACKAGING SECTOR OF THE TRAVEL SECTOR AND YOU KNOW IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SOLVE GET INTERNET SIR BY TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE. COMMITTED TO GET INTO THAT SORT OF I. TWENTY FIFTY QUID- COMING. LOOK YOUR ACCOUNT. AND THEN THAT'S ME TO TAKE MORE THAN CALC SIMPLE. FROM SOME. IF YOU SOLVED ENTIRE PROBLEM DIVEST FROM EVERYTHING THAT HAS. A CARBON. THERE'S REALLY PLACE HELP TO BE BEST FOR THEM POINTS. SO AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE- SHAREHOLDERS. I BELIEVE J. ANSWER. OUR AN EXAMPLE A SHAREHOLDER ACTIVITY WE NEED THAT WE HAVE SOME. SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AND THAT WAS WITH OXYGEN AND SAY ALSO IT'S ON SOME OF OUR ENGAGEMENT AND- PROXY AND VOTING. AND WITH EXXON AND GETTING THE CLIENTS I WILL BE GETTING A CLIMATE SCIENTIST ON THAT BOARD. AND WE FOUND THAT MOST OF THE PUBLIC COMPANIES BUT WE ARE ENGAGING FOR CLIMATE ACTION ONE HUNDRED PLUS HAD MADE A COMMITMENT TO CANCER. FIFTY WHAT IS CHANGING TO CATEGORY NEED THAT DATE I WOULD MORE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THAT EMISSION DATA SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE FORCEFUL AND NAVIGATIONAL BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE. FOR HOLDING MORE MORE ACCOUNTABLE NOT ENGAGEMENT SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE- CONTINUING TO PUSH ON THE S. E. C. YOU KNOW WE'RE- INVESTING LOCALLY WILL PUSH ON THAT I. R. S. AND THAT. YOU KNOW YES SHE REALLY HAS BECOME MORE AND A SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT STRATEGY LONGER TERM ABORTING TRYING TO. FIX IT WE CAN'T AVOID AND SHORT TERM. ISSUES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OBVIOUSLY SEARCH ENGINES WILL ADDRESS THAT WHERE WE CAN ENGAGE IN ACTION PATTERNS AND GAUGE OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED OUTCOME THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET TO WORK. ON THE ALBUM SOMETIMES A DISAGREEMENT IS REALLY ABOUT HOW TO GET TO THAT OUT TOGETHER AND THAT'S WHERE. WE'RE EXTENSIBLE WILL MEET WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WILL EXPLAIN THE SHIP WAR. AND REALLY TALK ABOUT WHY AND THE DECISIONS THAT WE'RE MAKING FOR THE PART BUT WE ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST. ON ALL TWO MILLION MEMBERS. THE END AND HER TEAM WERE USING IS POSTED ON THE WEBSITE- MOST OF US HAD- BUT HAND OUT OF THE CITY OF SLIDES- BUT THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CORE LISTENING IN WATCHING- GO TO THE TAB THAT SAYS. HEARINGS TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE WEBSITE- YOU CAN ACCESS- THE PRESENTATION THAT WAS JUST- GONE THROUGH IT AND PERHAPS IT MAY HELP ADDRESSING QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEFORE THE END OF THE HEARING THANK YOU KNOW BACK TO THE MEMBERS SOME. OF THE COMMITTEE'S ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. RIGHT SEEN NONE OF FROM THE EMBERS LET ME JUST. ASK- A RISK QUESTION THE MISS ROSS THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF QUESTIONS- I SUPPOSE A WEEK WE COULD- ASK YOU IN TERMS OF GETTING- EVEN MORE DETAIL IN ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING BUT JUST I'M JUST GOING TO LIMIT MYSELF TO ONE QUESTION HERE ALSO IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. ON CLIMATE- CLEARLY. YEAH YOU'RE DOING A LOT IN TERMS OF CONVENING FOLKS TO CURLY YOU HE TALKED ABOUT. THE OPPORTUNITY THERE WE HEARD FROM THE GOVERNOR LAST NIGHT HIS HIS TAKE ON. ON THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY- IN IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA OF THE ECONOMY IN THAT SPACE WHAT ABOUT THE RISK- WHAT IS IT WHAT IS THE RISK OF. THE CLIMATE CRISIS ITSELF. ON TO. YOUR INVESTMENTS TO THE PENSION FUNDS INVESTMENTS. WHERE DO YOU I ASSUME THAT YOU TRACK THAT- WHERE THE GREATEST THREATS IS IT. IS IN THE REAL ESTATE SPACES AND SOMEWHERE ELSE. HERE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WE ARE- RECENTLY INCIDENTS ONLY WITHIN THE LAST YEAR AND DID THE REPORTS ARE WHICH IS BASICALLY A STANDARD FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE CARBON BUT WHEN YOU ARE PROBABLY OUT OF THE TEACHING IT TO YOUR ACCOUNTS OF COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES AND YOU KNOW STEP ONE STEP TWO WHICH ARE THE DIRECT EMISSIONS ARE COMING FROM POSSIBLE CONFUSION IF YOU ARE. NOT REPRESENTS ABOUT YEAH I JUST WAS AT A CONFERENCE IN AND THE NUMBER THAT I NEED TO BACK THE OTHER DAY BUT YOU KNOW FORTY PERCENT. OF MUCH OF THE CARBON EMISSIONS ARE BECOMING FROM THE STATE AND THE LACK OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES GOING INTO BUILDINGS AND- WE'RE VERY LONG TIME CALIFORNIA JUST AROUND THE GLOBE I AM BACK IN YORK I JUST PUT IN LATER DECADES WE'LL START FINDING THOSE COMPANIES ARE THOSE BUILDINGS OWNERS OF THOSE BUILDINGS ARE NOT LABELS CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REMAINS CONNECTED BUILDINGS MORE. EFFICIENT SERVICE THERE'S THE SUBMISSIONS ARE EVERYWHERE IN THE PORTFOLIO JUST LOOK AT SOMEONE'S GOT TO WHERE WE THINK WE HAVE DATA INTEGRITY THAT'S ROUGHLY 20% OF ITS PORTFOLIO OF REAL ASSETS SIGNS INDICATING WE HAVE THAT WE MOVE ENERGY ASSETS AND ALL THOSE LOOKING FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. TO INCREASE IN THAT PORTFOLIO SIZE INTO THE BELIEF THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN SITTING AT THE TABLE WITH HIS COMPANY AND SITTING AT THE TABLE WHERE LIKE MINDED INVESTORS AND WE WILL FINANCE OPPORTUNITIES I MEAN AVAILABLE TO LAST YOU INVEST IN THIS TRANSFORMATION AGAIN THIS TRANSFORMATIONS. YOU HAVE TO BE IN. I TO IDENTIFY THEM AND WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE AND I TELL YOU. OF THAT WORLD INSTITUTE AND- I NOT HAVE THE BEST INSTRUMENT AND HOW SEEN IN STRAY- AND REALLY. DEVELOPING OUT THAT'S HOW ON YOUR DESK TEAM. HERE FOR. GET DATA AROUND THE HOUSE GAS EMISSION WERE BORN. I AM EQUITY NOW IT'S- THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE BUSINESS OUT. TO BE ABLE TO SAY YEAH THIS MAKES SENSE THIS WILL GET US TO OUR HARDER. OCCIDENTAL THESE TYPES OF MEASUREMENTS IN THE SECTOR WILL GET US TO THAT NEXT YEAR WILL BE TWENTY FIFTY OR SOONER. AND THAT'S WHEN WE GOT TALENT MANAGEMENT TALENT RECRUITMENT THAT'S THE NEXT SET OF AGREEMENTS. THAT. WILL BE DOING OUR BEST MARKETS. SHE DOES IN- IN ORDER RESPONSE I THOUGHT WAS ABOUT HIM JUST TELL WASN'T. AND DIVESTMENT AND ALMOST THE PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED IN- IN ASSETS THAT- WHERE MISSIONS ARE PRESENT I THINK WHAT I WAS REALLY ASKING MAYBE IS- THE. THE UNINTENDED OUTCOMES OF CLIMATE CHANGE IF YOU WILL WHAT WE'RE SEEING YOU KNOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY TO SOME DEGREE HAPPENING ALL OVER THE WORLD THOSE THINGS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED. TO CLIMATE I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT YOUR RISK ANALYSIS IS IF YOU HAVE ONE AND I CAN TAKE THAT OFF LINE WE DON'T NEED TO GO IN INTO A DEEP DIVE ON THAT HERE TODAY. TO WHAT DEGREE YOU'RE EVALUATING RISK WITH REGARD TO YOUR OWN INVESTMENTS IN ASSETS WITH REGARD TO WILDFIRE WITH REGARD TO SEA LEVEL RISE IN THE IN THE BAY AREA- IN THE SOUTH BAY AREA IN SILICON VALLEY- THE AREA I REPRESENT MOST OF THE DRIVING INDUSTRIES- SOME OF WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE INVESTED IN- ARE EXTRAORDINARILY CONCERNED- ABOUT- SEA LEVEL RISE WHICH IS BECAUSE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY MEASURABLE SO I'M I'M REALLY JUST ASKING WHAT WHAT. WHAT IS YOUR- WHAT WORK ARE YOU DOING TO EVALUATE THAT KIND OF CATASTROPHIC RISK IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN. INVESTMENT DIVESTMENT. OKAY I THINK FRANCE OR WHATEVER THE TERM IS PROBABLY STRANDED ASSETS YOU WILL GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS AROUND WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE STRANDED ASSETS INTO THESE TYPES OF SCENARIOS IN THE PORTFOLIO MAKING SURE TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT BUT I THINK SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR QUESTION WHAT ARE WE DOING AROUND MANAGING RISKS TO SEA LEVEL RISE OR WINE BUYERS WE RECENTLY JUST COMPLETED SO I'LL HAVE MORE INFORMATION FOR YOU SOON AT THIS TIME DATA ANALYSIS IS NOT QUITE COMPLETE YET. THAT WE PARTNERED WITH AN OUTSIDE- MANAGER TO COME UP WITH THE CONCEPT OF BREAST I SO IN A REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO OR YOU KNOW AND BEYOND FRANKLY WHERE DO WE SEE THE GREATEST ZIP CODE RACE BASED ON WHETHER THAT SINCE YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN WHETHER THAT MEANS YOU KNOW NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIVE TIMES I'VE BEEN I'LL HAVE MORE INFORMATION FOR YOU ON THAT QUESTION DIRECTLY VERY SOON YEAH AND JUST ASK. THE TOPLINE INFORMATION YEP NOT A- YOU KNOW THAT WE NEED TO. GET INTO. A PROPRIETARY WE'RE IN OUR THAT YOU'RE- BUT- HI DO IT WHICH DOING- YOU KNOW HOW YOUR CONVENING YOUR OWN YOUR OWN TEAM AROUND THE- IF YOU HAVE. A LEAVE BEHIND DOCUMENT FOR US AT SOME POINT YOU CAN DISTRIBUTE TO THE COMMITTEE. OF BOTH COMMITTEES THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- WE DO HAVE ANOTHER. QUESTION BY SOME MEMBER O'DONNELL. YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND I DO YOU MAY HAVE MENTIONED IT I DON'T KNOW I HEARD IT CLEARLY. AT WHAT PERCENT- IS PURSE FIND IT RIGHT NOW. WELL FUNDED 80% AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY ONE WHICH WAS THE LAST TIME. I WAS A LITTLE BIT AND YOU SAY EIGHTY EIGHT ZERO. ZERO GREAT THANK YOU AND MAYBE JUST A COMMENT I HOPE YOUR BOARD FULLY ENGAGES IN STATE LEGISLATION. I MEAN YEAH AND EVERY YEAR WE GET A NUMBER OF DIVESTMENT BILLS AND THOSE CONCERNED ME. IT SHOULD BE REALLY THE ROLE OF THE BOARD. TO DESIGN THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY OF THE DOLLARS THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MEMBER THOSE PEOPLE'S RETIREMENT MONEY. I'M ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF STIRS ENTERS- SO I DO HAVE GREAT CONCERNS WHEN PEOPLE JUST THROW DIVESTMENT BILLS AND IT'S OFTEN MORE OF A POLITICAL VENDETTA POLICY EVENT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WANT YOU TO BE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE WITH THESE DOLLARS BUT NOT NECESSARILY. FISCALLY RECKLESS SO I GET GOING FOR A GO FORWARD BASIS I HOPE THAT YOUR BOARD TAKES POSITIONS ON BILLS ETCETERA. BECAUSE THEY DO NEED TO INFORM THE LEGISLATURE AS TO THE IMPACTS. OF THE BILLS THAT THAT PEOPLE- SPONSOR AND WISH TO. WISH TO PUSH THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND SOMETIMES RESTRICT. YOUR ABILITY TO INVEST THE FUNDS IN THE IN THE BEST PLACES AGAIN I WANNA BE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WE ALSO NEED TO LET THE BOARD DO ITS JOB THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH MEMBER- THIS FOR US- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME- GREAT JOB GETTING THAT. PRETTY MASSIVE PRESENTATION DONE WITHIN GENERALLY WITHIN OUR TIME CONSTRAINTS HERE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. IN WE WILL. THERE IS ONE MORE QUESTION YES SOME SORRY I'M I'M MAY DEPEND DEBATING WHETHER ASK QUESTION HERE NOT A PROBLEM NOT A PROBLEM PLEASE PROCEED OKAY SO IN OUR PORTFOLIO WE MAKE A 21% RATE OF RETURN LAST YEAR DO WE HAVE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE CAN TRACK WHAT THE PERCENTAGES OF RATE OF RETURN ARE IN EACH OF THOSE- THOSE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT PORTFOLIO IS- IS. PERFORMING WELL AND WHAT PORTFOLIO WAS NOT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT A LOT OF TAXPAYERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. IS THAT WHEN THE- COSTS FOR THE SYSTEM. OUTWEIGH THE REVENUES WHICH IS THE RATE OF RETURN IS THE BEST REVENUE. WELL THE- IF IT TRICKLES DOWN THEY WIND UP PAYING MORE. SO HOW ARE THOSE DIFFERENT PORTFOLIOS PERFORMING WHAT'S THE STRONGEST PORTFOLIO AND WHAT'S THE WEAKEST ONE OF THE PERCENTAGES. THAT DAY- THEY ARE PERFORMING AT. MISS ROSS- MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE US ON THE TOP LINE RESPONSE TO THAT AND THEN PERHAPS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE YOU COULD GET- I'M SURE YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY DISTRIBUTED TO- THE FOLKS- YOU KNOW ON A MORE OF A WHOLESALE BASIS SO YOU GET TO US AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK AT A TOP LEVEL WE DO TRACK PERFORMANCE BY VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES NO BUT OUR GLOBAL EQUITY PERFORMANCE MEANS IN ORDER TO EXTEND CONTAINS PERFORMANCES PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND SO ON THAT IS REPORTED OUT ON EVERY QUARTER AND SIGNED HIM ON A WEBSITE THAT I WILL READ A SHEET THAT SHOWS YOU THAT PERFORMANCE OVER TIME THE BEST PERFORMING ASSET CLASS OVER TIME IS PRIVATE EQUITY DEPENDING ON WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH WITHIN THE MARKETS. AND YOUR BOTTLE AT ME TODAY THEY'RE GOING TO VERY OVERTIME BUT BY FAR THE ASSET CLASS AND PERFORMANCE- PRODUCES THE HIGHEST. RATING TERM IS PRIVATELY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS ROSS THEN A IF WE COULD ASSESS- THAT YOU DISTRIBUTE TO EACH. A MEMBER OF EACH OF THE TWO COMMITTEES TODAY- WE WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT IN AGAIN GRATEFUL FOR YOUR- YOUR OVERVIEW TODAY IN YOUR PRESENTATION HERE THANK YOU OKAY BUBBLE WILL BE OUR THIRD PRESENTATION TODAY AND THAT IS- FROM REPRESENT IS THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS WE HAVE WITH US TODAY MISTER ERIC STERN CEO OF THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND MR DAVID NELSON CEO OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY RETIREMENT ASSOCIATION- REPRESENTING THAT SYSTEM- WELCOME MISTER SHARON. MR NELSON AND YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIR. AND CHAIR COOPER MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES WERE VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY TO REPRESENT WERE COMMONLY CALLED THE SAKHIR SYSTEMS- ALL OF US HAVE JOINED THE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS. AND WORK TOGETHER FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF ALL OF OUR COUNTIES. IN THAT ORGANIZATION JUST SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION BEFORE WE GET INTO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE AFFECTING COUNTY SYSTEMS- YOU KNOW THAT THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THAT WARMS THE ABILITY FOR ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS TO- BE. ARMED THATLAWS CHANGED A NUMBER OF TIMES OVER THE YEARS AND ACTUALLY SOME OF THAT WATER IS CHANGED FOR SOME OF THE- INDIVIDUAL COUNTIS WITHIN THAT SO. EVEN THE YOU KNOW THE GOVERNING STRUCTURE OF OUR COUNTY SYSTEMS IS ALWAYS NOT ENTIRELY MATSON'S. ADDITIONALLY EACH. GOVERNED BY INDEPENDENT. BOARDS CONSISTING OF LOCAL ELECTED LOCALLY APPOINTED. WE HAVE A GREAT DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT AND POLICY AND PHILOSOPHY AMONG THOSE TWENTY SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AS WE SAID TWENTY COUNTIES OF ESTABLISHES SOME BUT THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBEROF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. EMPLOYERS WITHIN THOSE COUNTIES THAT HAVE JOINED OUR SYSTEMS AS WELL- SO WE REPRESENT NOT ONLY TWENTY COUNTIES BUT A NUMBER OF LOCAL SYSTEMS AS WELL ONE OF OUR SMALLEST COUNTIES MENDOCINO CERTAINLY OUR LARGEST. IS LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHICH REPRESENTS ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR TOTAL MEMBERS AND TOTAL ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. WE DO COLLECTIVELY REPRESENTS. JUST A LITTLE UNDER FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND RETIREES. AND WE HAVE COLLECTIVELY OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SIX BILLION IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT- WHEN LOOKING AT THE FUNDING STATUS BUT THE COUNTY SYSTEMS THERE IS DIVERSITY BUT ALL TAKEN TOGETHER. WE ARE A MARKET VALUE BASIS JUST UNDER 90% SO A LOT OF OUR SYSTEMS ARE IN A VERY SOLID FUNDING POSITION WE EVEN HAVE TWO OF THEM. THAT ARE OVER. A SOME OF ITS- FACING OUR SYSTEMS AND WE'LL TAKE A- GOOD MORNING I'M- SORRY THE PRESS THE PRESENTATION DAVE AND I WILL BE TAKING TURNS GOING THROUGH- GOING THROUGH THE SCIENCE. IT IS ONE ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO JUST TOUCH ON WAS REALLY RELATED TO THE- PANDEMIC AND AS WE GROW OUT OF THAT. AS YOU KNOW LABOR LABOR ISSUES- LABOR SHORTAGE ISSUES- REMOTE STAFFING ISSUES THAT WE'RE ALL DEALING WITH THAT WE SEE IN ALL ALL SORTS OF INDUSTRIES WERE NOT IMMUNE TO THAT AS WELL AS WE- RETURN TO WORK THE RETIREE RETURN TO WORK ROLES OR SOMETHING I JUST WANT TO PUT ON THE RADAR OF- OF BOTH COMMITTEES. WITH WITH TAPPARA BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THERE A LOT OF NEW RESTRICTIONS PUT INTO PLACE TO PREVENT DOUBLE DIPPING THOSE THE CONSENT VERY GOOD AT. POLICY REASONS BEHIND THAT SOME OF THOSE RULES WERE SUSPENDED DURING THE PANDEMIC TO DEAL WITH LABOR SHORTAGES THEY'VE BEEN OFF AND ON OVER THE LAST YEAR- AND THEY'RE NOW BEING THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING REMOVED IT IS IT IS AN AREA. OF INTEREST THAT WE HAVE AND I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES OF THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT HOW THOSE RULES ARE WORKING AND- MAYBE A BETTER LONG TERM A LONG TERM SOLUTION. AS WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH LABOR SHORTAGES. IN THE GOVERNMENT AND- JUST REAL BRIEFLY ONE OF THE ISSUES YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE WERE SOME RESTRICTIONS WITHIN THE OPEN PUBLIC MEETING LAWS THAT APPLY TO OUR SYSTEMS THAT WERE LIFTED AND WHAT WE FOUND MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS OF SOUND IS THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC WE'VE SEEN THE UTILIZATION OF THESE VIRTUAL MEETING TECHNOLOGY. GREATLY INCREASED ONLY OUR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION BUT IS ALSO INCREASE THE ABILITY OF OUR OWN BOARD MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE ON A REGULAR BASIS- REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE AND SO WE JUST WOULD ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE DEPENDENCE A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT- THOSE OPEN. PUBLIC MEETING LAWS TO PERHAPS. CORPORATIONS THE ADVANTAGES AND SOME OF THE BENEFITS THAT THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW FOR BOTH PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. IN. SO IT ISSUE THAT'S UNIQUE TO THE COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS- HAS TO DO WITH US CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT CAME DOWN IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND THIS WAS- IN THE AFTERMATH OF PEPPER IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SOME LITIGATION THAT- THERE WAS A THERE WAS A FOLLOW UP ON- ACROSS THE STATE WITH A DIFFERENT COUNTY SYSTEMS THAT DO NOT IMPACT- CALPERS ARE CASTERS BUT IT'S REALLY JUST FOCUSED ON THE COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS. DEALING WITH WHAT SORT OF TALENTS ARE INCLUDED AND ENGINE CALCULATIONS TO UNDERGRAD- PENSION SPIKING. THOSE CASES WERE ADJUDICATED OVER OVER A YEAR PERIOD. RULING CAME DOWN IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY- THIS AFFECTED ABOUT HALF THE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IT'S CALLED THE ALAMEDA DECISION BECAUSE ALAMEDA WAS THE LEAD- THE DEFENDANT. IN THAT CASE IT'S REQUIRED A LOT OF MODIFICATIONS TO PENSION CALCULATIONS- CONTRIBUTION RESPONSE PENSION ADJUSTMENTS ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE WITH THAT WITH SEVERAL SYSTEMS INCLUDING- MINE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY- ONE OF THE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT MIGHT UNDO CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THAT. YOU KNOW THE COURT RULED THAT KEPT THAT PAPER WAS CONSTITUTIONAL WE ALL ARE COMPLYING WITH THAT COURT MANDATE TO. TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH- FAIR UNIFORMED G. CALCULATIONS ACROSS THE STATE SO ANY ANY YOU KNOW LEGISLATION THAT MIGHT UNDO THE COURT DECISION IS SOMETHING WE'RE WATCHING REALLY CLOSELY IT CAN REQUIRE. SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD ON OUR END WE'RE VERY SMALL SYSTEMS WITH MUCH MORE STAFF TO HER SISTERS HAVE- COULD RE REALLY REQUIRE. A LOT OF HEADACHES MORE LITIGATION AND WE JUST REALLY LIKE TO GET. THESE ISSUES RESOLVED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AS WE- MANY PARTS ARE IN GOOD BUT INSTEAD AND YOU HATE EVEN RECORD. THAT THERE IS PERHAPS ANYTHING OTHER THAN POSITIVE NEWS- FULL FUNDED STATUS. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE'VE ALWAYS SEEN AND NOTICE AND IT'S NOT JUST YOU NEED TO CARRY. IT AROUND THE COUNTRY. OFTEN WHEN SYSTEMS FIND THEMSELVES IN A SOLID FUNDING POSITION. THERE IS POTENTIALLY PRESSURE TO LOOK AT BENEFITS FUTURE PERHAPS TRYING TO INCREASE BENEFITS AND WE KNOW WE JUST WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS. THESE FUNDED STATUSES ARE POINTS IN TIME- AND THAT. PERHAPS ADDING BENEFITS AT THE PEAK OF THE MARKET- WILL CREATE DOWNSIDE PRESSURE IN THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF FUNDING. SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS UNDERSTAND AND BE GRATEFUL FOR- THE STATUS THAT WE'RE IN BUT PERHAPS LOOKING AT SHORING UP- FOR INSTANCE LONG TERM INVESTMENT RETURN AND- THE RISKING SOME OF OUR PORTFOLIOS. MIGHT BE BETTER HOUSTON'S TO UTILIZE. THAT FULL FUNDING. REALLY LOOKING AT ENHANCEMENTS. REAL THAT'S THE TOPIC OF THE DAY THAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT AIR POWER AND I JERKED ABOUT SOME ISSUES AND THIS IS A THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING AREA FOR THE SMALLER COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE- WELL THE LEGISLATURE HAS- HAS PROVIDED DIRECTION AND THE REST OF BILLS OVER THE YEARS THE COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN- HAVE BEEN EXEMPT FRO THOSE AND IS REALLY A POLICY REASON IN A PRACTICAL ADMINISTRATIVE REASON FOR THAT. WE DO NOT MANAGE ASSETS INTERNALLY IN OUR SYSTEM SO WE WERE ALL EXTERNALLY MANAGED ASSETS. ACROSS THE TWENTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS AND- WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WE HIRE MANAGERS- AND ENTERED A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS. AND LARGELY CO MINGLED FUNDS THAT WE DON'T CONTROL- SO WE CHOOSE AND WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY HIRE A MANAGER. AND ALLOCATE DOLLARS TO THAT MANAGER TO INVEST IN OUR BEHALF. IN WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OR MUCH SWAY AND WHAT THOSE WITH THOSE INDIVIDUAL ASSETS ARE THOSE YOU KNOW WE DON'T BUY INDIVIDUAL STOCKS SO. THAT MANAGERS DOING THAT ON OUR BEHALF. AND SO IF WE EVER WERE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE WERE- REQUIRED OR OR DIRECTED TO DIVEST ROM A SPECIFIC ISSUE- WE COULD POTENTIALLY REQUIRES TO TERMINATE THAT MANAGER WHICH WHICH WOULD HAVE. BEEN A SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. IN ORDER TO POSSIBLY YOU KNOW TO GET RID OF A MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT MIGHT COST US. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TRANSACTION COST ON WINE THAT SO. THERE'S A VERY IN MINISTRY TO PRACTICAL REASONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS- HAS HAS NOT FOCUSED AS MUCH ON THE COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS APPRECIATE THAT DISCRETION. ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP KEEP THAT IN MIND AS THESE ISSUES- IF YOU NEED TO GET DISCUSSED AND DEBATED. OVER THE OVER THE NEXT YEAR. AND I THINK IT IT. YOU KNOW THE ENTRANCE OF THE QUESTIONS- CHAIR COOPER. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIS ERIC SAID YOU KNOW THE BEST MEN'S HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE THINGS OVER THE TIME THE BOARD SHOULD BE TAKEN ACTIONS ON THEIR OWN- YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T. HAVE ANY COLLECTED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE BEST MAN ACTIONS MAY HAVE OCCURRED OVER TIME POSSIBLE IMPACT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STAKEHOLDER CHANGED AGAIN WITH TWENTY BOARDS. FOR YOU KNOW VARIOUS PHILOSOPHIES AND ACTIVE BASKIN YOU'RE GONNA BE A LOT OF DIFFERENT. ACTIONS AS TO HOW THEY THESE BOARDS TO ENGAGE WITH OUR PARTNERS IF AT ALL WITH REGARD TO THOSE THINGS AND THE SAME WITH THE S. STREET. THERE IS A WIDE DIVERSITY OF WHETHER FOLKS ARE USING ESP HOW THEY'RE USING AS TO WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT. WHAT POLICIES THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE WITH REGARD TO THE ISSUE SO IT'S NOT A MARGIN IS ACROSS OUR TWENTY SYSTEMS IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY. IN ANY SORT OF- FOLLOW ON TO A QUESTION TO MISTER COOPER HAD. ABOUT THE ROLE THAT WE HAVE A SHAREHOLDERS IS THAT WE ARE WE ARE FEATURES OF THE SIGN AND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE WE WERE PASSIVE INVESTORS- MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS TO USE- PROXY VOTING SERVICES TO. TO PARTICIPATING SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS BUT TO A LARGE EXTENT WE ARE- WE ARE PASSIVE INVESTORS- REALLY TAKING OUR FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS IS SORT OF THE PRIMARY FOCUS- AND NOT ENGAGING AS MUCH AND- SOCIAL SOCIAL ISSUES. THAT CAN. THAT CAN RANGE FROM DIFFERENT FUND OF FUNDS. WE HAVE AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION THANKS FOR DOING SUCH A CONCISE JOB OF IT YOU'RE- THREATENING TO KEEP GET US BACK ON TRACK YOUR TIME WHY SO. THAT'S UNUSUAL IN THESE CHAMBERS- YES AS A MEMBER WITH ON YEAH I JUST A QUICK COMMENT- IT KIND OF A YOU KNOW IT'S- IT'S BUILT ON THE COMMENTS MADE PREVIOUSLY ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE DIVESTMENT OF THE DAY. AND I JUST DON'T BUY INTO THE ARGUMENT THAT COUNTIES SHOULDN'T BE SUBJECT TO A STATE POLICY AS WELL- WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER IT'S BAD POLICY IT'S BAD POLICY FOR EVERYBODY. SO FOR THE COUNTIES TO MAKE A CASE THAT HEY THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I DON'T KNOW THAT I BUY INTO THAT WE DON'T NEED TO BE LITTLE HAT ARGUMENT TODAY BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT I. I BUY INTO THAT AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU PERSONAL FINANCE. ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TO THIS PANEL- THE- SEEN NONE. FROM THE FLOOR LET ME LET ME JUST ACTUALLY. PICK UP ON- WERE SOME MEMBER OF PUT ON A LEFT OFF BUT- MORE IN TERMS OF A QUESTION PERHAPS IN A COMMENT- IN THIS CASE IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT. THE FIRST ONE YOU JUST SAY I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT DIVESTMENT- IN AND HOW THEY CAN IMPACT THINGS BUT- SOMETIMES WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE- THE WORLD IS AT WAR OR- THE STATE HAS- IF. FOR WHATEVER REASON FEELS AN OBLIGATION TO. A TO MOVE AWAY FROM CERTAIN INVESTMENTS I WOULD ASSUME THAT YOUR CONTRACTS. WITH- I'M HERE WITH WITH YOUR INVESTMENT FIRMS HAVE. TYPICAL THE WHOLE CLUB OWNER PLAY LANGUAGE IN THAT SAYS THAT- THEIR ACTIVITIES HAVE TO COMPORT WITH STATE LAW OR THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- MAY OR MAY NOT ADOPT LAWS WHICH IMPACT THOSE INVESTMENTS IT IS THAT THE CASE OR NOT THE CASE. YES THERE ARE YES OUR CONTRACTS AT ALL- BREAKS POSSIBLY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH CALIFORNIA OKAY GREAT IN IN I DON'T WANNA BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO. YOU KNOW PUSH ON THAT ISSUE BUT- IT WOULD PROBABLY BE HELPFUL AT SOME POINT FOR. FUTURE REFERENCE I THINK OF FOR US TO UNDERSTAND US BEING. THE LEGISLATURE- IN. ALL ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MEMBERS TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE ARE ISSUES WITH REGARD TO PHASING IN CHANGES THAT MAYBE ARE MORE ACUTE WITH YOU I WAS SUSPECT BECAUSE OF THIS DIFFERENT SCALE THAT YOU'RE AT. THEN THE FOLKS WE JUST HEARD FROM FOR EXAMPLE CALPERS THAT YOU MAY- HE CHANGES MAY. BE NOT BE- MADE AS NIMBLY AS AS PERHAPS SOMEBODY ELSE COULD DO WHERE WERE IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE PORTFOLIO BUTTON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO COMMENT ON THAT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT MORE IS A REQUEST FOR. YOU KNOW FOR FUTURE INFORMATION- AS- AS SOON AS R. O. OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE EITHER IN THE STATUTORY HEARINGS OR- MEMBER. CONTACTS OF ONE ON ONES WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND- WHEN CHANGES ARE MADE- WHAT THE CRITICAL PATH IS FOR YOU- THANK YOU AND I WANT TO TURN TO A TEACHER COOPER NOW. THANK YOU MR HERE'S A QUICK COMMENT- THERE ARE. EIGHTY FIVE DIFFERENT RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA FOR SCOOTERS SECOND COUNTY- THEY DON'T HAVE RETIREE MEDICAL. THURS DOESN'T PERS DOES AND THAT'S DRIVES A LOT OF THOSE COST IN THERE TO PAY FOR RETIREES MEDICAL THAT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE SO IT'S NOT APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON YOU EXIT EIGHTY FIVE RETIRED MRS IN CALIFORNIA SO VERY DIFFERENT IF YOU NOTICE- IS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES NOT A NOT A BIG NUMBER WHEN COMPARED TO STIRS A PURSE THANK YOU MR THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION OF ONE MORE CALL FOR QUESTIONS- FROM THE FLOOR SO TO SPEAK- SEEN NONE- THANK YOU. GENTLEMEN VERY MUCH FOR. YOUR PRESENTATION AND- YOUR RESPONSE TO OUR QUESTIONS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR LAST PRESENTATION FOR TODAY WHICH IS BY THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM COASTERS REPRESENTED BY KASANDRA LOOK SMART. AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IN MR CHRISTOPHER AILMAN CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AND JUST BEFORE- THE TWO OF YOU BEGIN TO PRESENT LET ME- LET ME JUST. MAKE MY ANNOUNCEMENT ONE MORE TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- ASSUMING SO PEOPLE MIGHT BE TUNING IN- TUNING OUT- IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ANY PRESENTATIONS. ON OUR WEBSITE GO TO THE WEBSITE AND THEN LOOK AT THE TAB THIS- HEARINGS HEARINGS TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT WOULD BE THE TAB ON THE WEBSITE. WHERE YOU CAN SEE. ANY OF THE MATERIALS THAT ARE BEING PRESENTED TO US TODAY THANK YOU AND NOW TO OUR PRESENTERS PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING ARCHER'S PARTIES IN COOPER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M BECAUSE ANDERLECHT NOT THE CHIEF OPERATING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT CAL STARS I WAS. JUST APPOINTEDTO THE POSITION- ON JULY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE AND I WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER CASTERS- WHICH IS WHY I'M STILL USING THAT TITLE. SOME OF THE TIMES. ACCOUNT SERVICES THE LARGEST EDUCATOR ONLY RETIREMENT SYSTEM IN THE NATION AND WE PROVIDE RETIREMENT DISABILITY AND SURVIVOR BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA EDUCATORS AND THEIR FAMILIES WE DO NOT PROVIDE. MEDICAL CARE IN RETIREMENT SO I JUST WANTED TO CORRECT THAT THOSE- RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS ARE ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR TEACHERS- SO THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN HAT CALPERS ADMINISTERS. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR BENEFIT TO OUR CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATORS OUR MEMBERS DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN SOCIAL SECURITY FOR ANY OF THE CASTERS COVERED EMPLOYMENT. AND WITH THE CAREER LONGEVITY OF OUR MEMBERSHIP OUR MEMBERS RELY UPON- BENEFIT AS THE MAJORITY IF NOT SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME IN RETIREMENT. WE TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY AN ADMISSION DRIVES EVERY DECISION THAT WE MAKE AS AN ORGANIZATION. A FEW YEARS AS PROBABLY KNOW THE FUN WAS PROJECTED TO RUN OUT OF ASSETS IN ABOUT THIRTY YEARS BUT- BECAUSE OF OUR CULTURE SPENDING PLAN THAT WAS ADOPTED IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN. CASTERS AS FINANCIALLY STRONGER AND BETTER POSITIONED TO ACHIEVE FOR FINDING. THE FUNDING PLAN INCREASED COMP CONTRIBUTIONS AMONG THE PROGRAMS THREE COM CONTRIBUTORS CASTERS MEMBERS EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE. AND IN FACT CASTERS IS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND ITS GOAL OF REACHING FULL FUNDING BY TWENTY FORTY SIX THE TARGET DATE ESTABLISHED IN OUR FUNDING PLAN. THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS MADE TO THE STATE THE LAST FEW YEARS TO REDUCE ITS SHARE OF THE CASTERS UNFUNDED LIABILITY. COMBINED WITH THE TWENTY SEVEN POINT 2% INVESTMENT RETURN THAT WE EARNED LAST YEAR. PUT CASTERS ON A PATH THAT COULD LEAD US TO FULL FUNDING PRIOR TO THE TWENTY FORTY SIX TARGET DATE. AND THE STATE COULD ACTUALLY FULLY ELIMINATE THEIR SHARE OF THE CULTURES AND FUNDED LIABILITIES IN THE NEXT. TWO TO THREE YEARS. THE KIOSK OF THE FUNDING PLAN IS THE LIMITED RATE SETTING AUTHORITY THAT PROVIDES THE BOARD. TO ADJUST THE STATE AN EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES AND THIS ALLOWS CASTERS TO RESPOND TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND BETTER POSITIONS US TO TEACHING FOR FUNDING. BUT THERE ARE RISKS THAT REMAIN- AS WE ARE MONITORING THE FUNDING PLAN THAT COULD PREVENT US FROM REACHING THE FULL FUNDING. AND THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THREE I'M GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT- BRIEFLY. THE FIRST IS THE LONGEVITY RISK. THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED ALL THREE OF THE WRIST IN DIFFERENT WAYS. AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO IMPACT THESE RISKS ON THE SHORT TERM- AS AN END AS WELL AS A LONG TERM. THE LONGEVITY RISK REFERS TO THE POTENTIAL THAT MEMBERS LIVE LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED. RESULTING IN THE NEED FOR THEIR LIFETIME BENEFIT TO COVER A LONGER PERIOD THAN EXPECTED. LIVING LONGER FOR RETIREMENT SYSTEM NEEDS PAINTWORK AND BENEFITS. AND ON THAT FRONT CASTERS IS UNIQUE OR TEACHERS ENJOY A LONGER LIFESPAN THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN THE UNITED STATES. A FEMALE CASTERS TEACHER LIVES ON AVERAGE TWO TO THREE YEARS LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE WOMAN LIVING IN CALIFORNIA AND FIVE TO SIX YEARS LONGER. THAN THE AVERAGE U. S. WOMAN. AND WITH BEING WOMEN. THIS LONGEVITY CORRELATES WITH THE MAJORITY F OUR MEMBER POPULATION. JUST TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN MEMBERS THAT ARE OVER THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED. IN OUR SYSTEM WITH OUR OLDEST RETIRING BEING ONE HUNDRED NINE YEARS OF AGE SO YOU CAN SEE THE SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE THAT THERE FOR NOW. FINANCIAL SECURITY. AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN A FINANCIAL SECURITY- IS CORE TO WHAT WE DO. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC ADDS EXTRA CERTAINTY TELSTRA'S PROJECTIONS OF THE LIFE EXPECTANCY AND IT'S REALLY NOT CLEAR WHETHER. THE PANDEMIC WILL HAVE LONG TERM OR SHORT TERM IMPACTS ON MORTALITY. AND REALLY NOT KNOW THIS FOR THE- NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. BUT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC CASTERS IS ALSO SEEN A DECLINE. OF MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND AND THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE MEMBERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEFINED. BENEFIT PROGRAM. THIS WOULD N. AS IN. INACTIVE MEMBERS HAS BEEN OVER THE- TWO YEARS AND THIS ISN'T UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA WE'RE SEEING THIS- ACROSS THE NATION THAT THE- THAT THE PAYROLL GROWTH AND- ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IN THE TEACHER POPULATION IS CONTINUING TO DECLINE. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE IN ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP WITH A HIGHER THAN EXPECTED RETIREMENTS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. ADDITIONALLY RECENT DECLINES IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ENROLLED IN THE CATER TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AS WELL AS THE PROJECTED DECLINE IN FUTURE MOMENTS MAY RESULT IN A NEED FOR FEWER TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS COULD FURTHER IMPACT THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE TEACHES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEFINED BENEFIT PROGRAM. SO THERE IS A GROWING CONCERN RELATED TO THE LONG TERM PAIN OR DYSFUNCTION OF THREE AND A HALF PERCENT THAT IS USED IN THE FUNDING OF THE SYSTEM. THE RULES OF THE FUNNY PLAN AS WELL AS THESE ISSUES AFFECTING PAYROLL GROWTH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT HOUSES ABILITY TO FOR FINDING ADULTS REQUIRING CONTRIBUTION RATE INCREASES ESPECIALLY. FOR OUR EMPLOYERS. BUT OF ALL THE RISKS PASTORS MONITORS INVESTMENT RELATED VOLATILITY REMAINS THE GREATEST RISK FACING CONCERTS TODAY AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE- JUST TO REITERATE WHAT DAVID LAMB OR- HAD MENTIONED ABOUT SIXTY CENTS COME. OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE PAY COMES FROM INVESTMENT INCOME. AND THE COMBINATION OF CASTERS BEING A MATURE SYSTEM EVER CREATED IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN AND THE DECREASING TIME FRAME OF THE FUNDING PLAN ONLY SERVES TO EXASPERATED STRESS. AND WHEN INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE BELOW EXPECTATIONS THE UNFUNDED ACTUARIAL OBLIGATION INCREASES WHICH IN TURN REQUIRES ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO BRIDGE. THE GAP. BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER LAST YEAR IS TWENTY SEVEN POINT 2% INVESTMENT RETURN HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE OUTLOOK FOR FUNDING LEVELS IN THE STATE CONTRIBUTION RATES AND- REALLY ASSUMING THAT- THE FUND EARNED 7% OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE STATE SHARE THE UNFUNDED OBLIGATION IS NOW PROJECTED. TO BE ELIMINATED BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. ANOTHER PART TOOL IN MY- THE PLAY ISN'T SHE THE AXE. SOME THAT WE USE OUR A PROBE WORKFLOW EXPO. OF THE FUTURE. AND EVERY FOUR YEARS PASTORS PERFORMS A FORMAL REVIEW. OF OUR ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND THIS REVIEW WAS DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE REVIEW OF OUR ASSET ALLOCATION. WHICH IS HOW WE INVEST OUR ASSETS AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE RECEIVE. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS. THAT ARE MORE TAKES ON EVERY FOUR YEARS AND DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE LONG TERM INVESTMENT RETURN TURN ASSUMPTION ARE CURRENTLY SET AT SEVEN PERCENT. THE BOARD LAST REVIEW THE ADOPTION AND ADOPTED THE ASTROS SOME SINCE LAST JANUARY. JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY. AND THE NEXT REVIEW CYCLES OF WILL BEGIN NEXT FISCAL YEAR TAKES APPROXIMATELY A YEAR TO GET THROUGH THAT PROCESS. I ALSO WANTED TO TOUCH ON ONE OF THE- SPECIFIC ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FUNDING OF CASTERS DEFINED BENEFIT. PROGRAM AND THAT'S INFLATION AND THAT WAS ONE OF THEM. COMMENTS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER IN THE- HEARING TODAY IT'S AN IMPORTANT SOMETHING THAT IMPACTS- EXPECTED PAPER WORKS. AND THE INCIDENT INVESTMENT RETURN AND MORE IMPORTANTLY CAN IMPACT OUR MEMBERS NEGATIVE NEGATIVELY WE ALL KNOW INFLATION HAS REALLY BEEN HI THIS LAST YEAR IT'S MATTER OF FACT EVEN. HAD MENTIONED THAT IT'S THE HIGHEST THAT WE'VE SEEN. IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA AND WHEN AN INFLATION IS HIGH IT CAN BE VERY HARMFUL TO OUR OLDER RETIREES BECAUSE OUR BENEFIT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME PURCHASING POWER. AS WHEN THEY RETIRED. AND- SEVERAL MEASURES IN PLACE TO HELP PROTECT OUR OLDER RETIREES FROM THE IMPACT OF INFLATION THE FIRST. IS A SIMPLE 2% ANNUAL BENEFIT ADJUSTMENT. I'M IN THE SECOND AS OUR SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT MAINTENANCE ACCOUNT OR SBMA. CASTERS ADMINISTERS THE ESTIMATE WHICH IS A PROGRAM. DESIGNED TO PROTECT RETIRED MEMBERS AGAINST HIGH INFLATION BY HELPING MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF PURCHASING POWER PROTECTION. AND THIS PROGRAM IS FUNDED BY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE STATE AND HELPS ARE OLDER RETIRED MEMBERS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES BY ENSURING. THEIR PURCHASING POWER DOES NOT DROP BELOW 85% THE LEVEL CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY. REPLACING PROTECTION PROGRAM. THIS BEEN IF IT IS IMPORTANT FOR MEMBERS. AN INCIDENT CORTESE AND- SENT BILL EIGHT SIXTY OF A BILL THAT PER A JUST SP. O THOSE WHO BEGAN RECEIVING BENEFITS PRIOR TO NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE ARE QUITE A FEW THAT- IN OUR SYSTEM THAT DO RECEIVE BENEFITS. AND NEED TO HAVE THAT PROTECTION THE TEACHERS RETIREMENT BOARD IS FORMALLY ADOPTED AT A SUPPORT POSITION ON THIS BILL LAST WEEK. I'M THAT THE MEETING SO I'LL GO AND HANDED OVER TO. OUR CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER CHRIS ELEMENT TO TALK ABOUT OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN THE- THE FUNDING LEVELS AND DISCUSS AND ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS OPPOSED BY- NUMBER. OR PRESS. THIS OF. THE CHAIR CORTESE AND COOPER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY MY NAME'S CHRIS SALMON ON THE TEETH IN THE SOFT SERVICE WAS INTRODUCED LET ME TALK FOR MEN ABOUT DIVERSIFICATION DIVERSIFICATION IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE FOR MITIGATING RISK AS AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR AND INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS WERE DIVERSIFIED ACROSS- ASSETS AND DIVERSIFIED ACROSS COUNTRY- AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT DIVERSIFICATION ACTUALLY IS IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION IS A EQUIREMENT FOR ALL THE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS. WITHIN THAT DIVERSIFICATION COMES UP THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT DIVEST AND YOU BROUGHT IT UP SEVERAL TIMES TODAY- WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT CAL STIRS HAS TO INVESTED- A TOTAL OF SIX TIMES OVER THE LAST TWENTY TWO YEARS- I'M KIND OF SAD TO SAY WERE PROBABLY THE MOST MORE THAN ANY OTHER PLAN IN THE COUNTRY. OF ALL THOSE TO VESTMENTS EACH ONE OF THEM TO DATE HAS LOST MONEY- TO ANSWER- CINDER COOPER'S QUESTION WERE AT NINE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF LOST AN OPPORTUNITY LOST A LOT OF THAT IS THE COMPOUNDING- AND AS- MARCY FROST SAID DID A LOT OF IT IS DUE TO TOBACCO- IF YOU. ADDED THAT BACK IN OUR PLAN WOULD BE THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER IN OUR FUNDING PLAN- AND WE'D BE A LOT QUICKER TO BEING FULLY FUNDED PUBLIC UP CUT A COUPLE YEARS OFF OUR PLAN TO BE FULLY FUNDED- NOW A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS MAY FINALLY TURN EVEN- BUT IT'S SAD TO SAY- AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY PERSONAL HISTORY ADMINISTERS FOR THOSE TWENTY TWO YEARS. NONE OF THEM HAS ACTUALLY BROUGHT ABOUT ANY SOCIAL CHANGE THEY'VE ALL BEEN FOREIGN INVESTMENT DECISION TO TRY TO MITIGATE RISKS AND SINCE WE'VE LOST MONEY TODAY THEY HAVEN'T HELPED US MITIGATE. RISK BUT WE KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE. WITH THE DIVEST THOUGH AND I AND I GUESS I WOULD ADD. IF YOU THOUGHT OF A SINGLE WORD WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD DIVEST MEANT THINK OF THE WORD AS DISENGAGEMENT IT CAUSES US TO TURN OUR BACK TO A PROBLEM OR IGNORE PROBLEM AND I KNOW THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO PUT OUT STRONG STATEMENTS- BUT I AGREE WITH THE OTHER STATEMENTS ABOUT ALLOWING THE BOARD TO MAINTAIN THEIR FIDUCIARY ARREST. WE ALL CONSIDER ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE FACTORS IN OUR INVESTMENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS- CASTERS FIRMLY BELIEVES IN ACTIVE MANAGEMENT AND ENGAGEMENT- WE SOLD MANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS- IN RUSSIA AS THIS HORRIBLE WAR BROKE OUT. TO MITIGATE OUR RISK- UNDER TWENTY ONE RISK FACTORS- SO WE WILL TAKE ACTIONS IN OUR PORTFOLIO- BECAUSE WE'RE ALL WE BOTH- BIG FUNDS BELIEVE IN SUSTAINABILITY INCORPORATING SUSTAINABILITY OR ESG IS ACTUALLY IN OUR CORE INVEST SOME POLICY AND IT'S IN EVERY SINGLE ASSET CLASS INVESTMENT POLICY. SO MY STAFF AND IHAVE TO LOOK AT THAT ON EVERY SINGLE INVESTMENT WE DO. AND YOU KNOW THE WORLD'S NOT BLACK AND WHITE SO EVERYTHING COMES WITH SHADES OF GREY ABOUT RISK. AND WHETHER ONE RISK IS ACCEPTABLE OR WHETHER IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. WE'RE VERY WELL AWARE OF CENTER GONZALEZ BILL SB. ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE OUR BOARD TOOK A POSITION LAST WEEK TO OPPOSE THAT BILL AND WILL BE SHARING THAT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THE REASON IS WE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRESSING ISSUE IT IS CRITICAL TO OUR PORTFOLIO IS CRITICAL OF MANKIND. I DO NOT BEING- pCASTERS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE LEADING VOICES IN THE NATION AND THE WORLD AS A PENSION PLAN ON CLIMATE CHANGE. WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE DRAMATIC CHANGES IN OUR ENGAGEMENT. WHICH MADE A CHANGE IT WORKING WITH THE HEDGE FUND IN CALIFORNIA TO CHANGE THE EXXON MOBIL BOARD. WE'VE WORKED WITH OCCIDENTALIS CALPERS DID TO MAKE DRAMATIC CHANGES AND THERE WE ACTUALLY CHANGE THE CEO MANY YEARS BACK. SO WE WILL STEP UP AND SHOW OUR STRENGTH IN AND AS JAMES SAID FROM CALPERS. IF YOU WANNA GO FAST TOO BY YOURSELF BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET A LOT DONE AND YOU WANT TO GO FARTHER YOU WORK WITH OTHERS. SO JUST GIVE YOU SOME NUMBERS ON OUR PAST ENGAGEMENT- WE WORK WITH A A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN COMPANIES. APPOINTING WOMEN TO THEIR BOARDS WE WORK TO THE CALIFORNIA INVESTORS GROUP WHICH INCLUDED THE COUNTIES. AND WE ACHIEVED FIFTY TWO COMPANIES THAT ADDED WOMEN OR A DIVERSE PERSON TO THEIR CORPORATE BOARD. AND WE'RE NOT DONE. BOTH CALPERS AND CAL STIRS A BEEN DOING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS IT'S RATHER AMAZING AND PAST LEGISLATURES RECOGNIZE THAT. THEY CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED THESE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POSITIONS AT BOTH FUNDS SO THAT. GOVERNORS COULDN'T CUT IT OUT AT DIFFERENT TIMES. AND WE BOTH STAYED COMMITTED AND WE'RE BOTH AMONGST THE LEADERS IN THIS ENTIRE NATION. AND ENGAGING COMPANIES. CAL STIRS LAST FALL MADE A COMMITMENT TO BE NET ZERO BY TWENTY FIFTY OR SOONER. WE JOIN MANY COMPANIES AND MANY. OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER PLANS WITH THE UNITED NATIONS- TO ACHIEVE THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US AND IT IS SOMETHING THE BOARD IS GOING TO ADDRESS ON A REGULAR BASIS. UPCOMING IN MAY WILL ANNOUNCE OUR WHAT WE CALL OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND OUR CARBON INTENSITY. AND WE WILL PLEDGE ON WHERE WE WANT TO BE OUR GOAL FOR WHAT WE WANT TO BE AND REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT BY TWENTY THIRTY. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TWENTY FORTY. BUT WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. DIVESTITURE OF CARBON WOULD JUST CHANGE OUR PORTFOLIO BUT WE NEED MANKIND WE NEED EVERYBODY. TOGETHER ON THIS TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR IN ORDER TO ROUTE SCREEN OUT PASSES. AND ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS WAS YOU KNOW IS IT IN INDUSTRY IS JUST ONE INDUSTRY THE PROBLEM. AS MARCY SAID THE ANSWERS NOW. GREENHOUSE GASES ARE EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERYTHING. IT STARTS WITH ELECTRICITY TRANSPORTATION WHICH EVERYBODY THINKS OF BECAUSE AUTOMOBILES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IT'S ALSO IN AGRICULTURE WHICH IS GOING TO BE A HUGE ISSUE IN OUR STATE. IS IN MANUFACTURING- IT'S IN REAL ESTATE AS MARTY MENTIONED SO. WE NEED TO WORK COMPREHENSIVELY ACROSS ALL THOSE AREAS NOT JUST ONE AREA AND NOT VILLAIN EYES ONE INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT'S GONNA JUST CREATE A WAR BACK AND FORTH. WHERE WE GET VERY LITTLE DONE. OUR OTHER STEWARDSHIP PRINCIPLES- BECAUSE- CENTER FOR ASK ABOUT THOSE. WE'RE WORKING ON CORPORATE MARKET ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT MARKET AND CORPORATE DISCLOSURE CORPORATE CEO PAY AND DISCLOSURE ON THAT. WE ARE WORKING ON EFFECTIVE CORPORATE BOARDS PUSHING FOR DIVERSITY ON THEIR BOARDS- AND TURNOVER ON BOARDS. WE'RE WORKING ON HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT WHICH IS REALLY A NICE WAY OF SAYING THE WORK FORCE GETTING BETTER REPRESENTATION IN THE WORKFORCE BETTER DIVERSITY OF THE WORKFORCE OF WORKER RIGHTS. AND WE ALSO WORK VERY HARD ON THE LOW CARBON ECONOMY AND TRYING TO GET COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH THAT PLAN. AND BEGIN A TRANSITION TO THAT. LOW CARBON ECONOMY AND LASTLY IT OUR PHONE WE PREDICT WE CARE ABOUT FIREARMS SO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN CREATING A SET OF FIRE ON PRINCIPLES. AND REALLY TRYING TO PROMULGATE THOSE NOT THE FIREARM COMPANIES BECAUSE WE INVESTED OF THOSE SO THEY WON'T TALK TO US WE CAN'T TALK TO THEM BUT TO RETAILERS. FINANCE COMPANIES EVEN SHIPPERS. TO REALLY TRYING GET SOME BETTER RESPONSIBILITY. IN THE FIREARM INDUSTRY. TWO OTHER THINGS I JUST WANT TO CLOSE ON REAL QUICK YOU'LL HEAR FROM US THE COLLABORATIVE MODEL WE NEED TO HEAR THAT JUST THINK OF WE'RE TRYING TO DO BUSINESS DIFFERENTLY WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT OF SOME OF THE PARTNERSHIPS AND ACTUALLY OWN OUR ASSET MANAGERS- I CAN TELL YOU HONESTLY THAT I THINK WITHIN FIVE YEARS WILL PROBABLY SAVE CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IN FEES TO WALL STREET BY IMPLEMENTING THIS COLLABORATIVE MODEL. YOU'RE THE BALDWIN CALPERS RUN A LOT OF ASSETS IN HOUSE IT SURPRISES PEOPLE BUT IN SACRAMENTO YOU HAVE TWO VERY LARGE TRADE DEFICITS. IN OUR CASE WE RUN OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION. IN WEST SACRAMENTO- WITH OUR STAFFS- VERY VERY EFFECTIVELY. THE OTHER ONE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR BOARD IS DIVERSITY INCLUSION. AND EQUITY. WE BELIEVE IN DIVERSITY NOT ONLY OF OUR INTERNAL TEAM WHICH IS FANTASTIC BUT ALSO ESPECIALLY OF OUR EXTERNAL MANAGERS. NO I SAID WE DO BUSINESS AROUND THE WORLD SO DIVERSITY CHANGES AROUND THE WORLD I TRY TO BE A VOICE OF WHAT DIVERSITY MEANS. FROM THE CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE- BUT ALSO PUSH THAT ON OUR INVESTMENT YOUR- I PERSONALLY WORK WITH THE CFA THAT CHARTERED FINANCIAL ANALYST INSTITUTE THAT'S OUR LEADING INDUSTRY ORGANIZATION FOR INVESTMENTS. TO PUT OUT- THEIR STANDARD FOR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AND THEIR BEST PRACTICES ON DIVERSITY INCLUSION. WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE THE FACE OF THE INVESTMENT IN STRAIGHT AWAY FROM PEOPLE LIKE ME AND I GET IT. BUT TOMORROW DIVERS FACE MORE THIS REPRESENTATIVE CALIFORNIA BUT IT TAKES TIME THE SUPPLY OF PEOPLE COMING UP IN THE BUSINESS SCHOOL BUT IT'S ALSO THAN FINDING THEM. SO THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO SUCCEED. YOU'RE GONNA SEE A REPORT FROM US- SHORTLY ON OUR D. AND I EFFORTS WITHIN CANCERS AND THEN WITH OUR VESSEL PORTFOLIO. WE IN CALPERS HAVE TEAMED UP TOGETHER AND PRODUCED A CONFERENCE LAST YEAR ON DIVERSITY IN OUR INDUSTRY. AND ACTUALLY DONE FIVE OF THOSE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS SO THE TWO OF US HAVE BEEN VERY VOCAL. WE WORK WITH A LOT OF GROUPS- IN THE LEGISLATURE- IT'S GOOD TO SEE- CENTER COOPER AGAIN- AND A LOT OF THE AFFINITY GROUPS- IN OUR INDUSTRY THAT REALLY PUSHES ON DIVERSITY- SO FOR OUR BOARD IT IS CRITICAL RIGHT NOW I'M MERGING MANAGERS IN OUR PORTFOLIO WHICH FRANKLY JUST MEANS SMALL. BUT THAT'S THE WAY WE HAVE TO MEASURE IT RIGHT NOW WITH PROP TWO OH NINE- IT REPRESENTS ABOUT 15% OF OUR EXTERNAL MANAGERS- WE COULD DO BETTER AND I GET PRESSURE ALL THE TIME TO DO MORE BUT I THINK THAT'S A NICE START. IN AN AREA FOR US TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. LASTLY WITH ALL THOSE EFFORTS AND GOALS I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THAT. OUR JOB IS STILL TO MAKE WE DON'T MAKE THE FULL FUNDING PLAN WE PUT PRESSURE ON YOU AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ESPECIALLY ON TEACHERS ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SO. WE GOT A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US OUR GOAL ALL THE TIME IS TO KEEP HITTING THAT THAT AVERAGE. BECAUSE SANDRA BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU CHRIS- AND AS FOR SAID WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE EFFORTS TO FIND NEW WAYS TO STRENGTHEN. OUR OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO ATTRACT- A HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND- TALENTED WORKFORCE. WE KNOW THAT DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT AND EXPERIENCE AS A TALENT IS WHAT. WILL MAKE US RESILIENT IN AN EVER CHANGING. WORK ENVIRONMENT. WE WELCOME AND EMBRACE DIVERSITY OF THINKING BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE. TO ENHANCE OUR CULTURE AND DRIVER BUSINESS SUCCESSES. VALUING EACH INDIVIDUAL'S PERSPECTIVE. EMPOWER STAFF TO PERFORM THEIR BEST WORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR MISSION. AND CAL STIRS DIVERSITY EQUITY ANDINCLUSION EFFORT IS AN INITIATIVE TO ATTRACT AND RECRUIT A DIVERSIFIED WORKFORCE. REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S GROWING POPULATION WHILE ALSO REALIZING STAFF NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED AND DEVELOPED ONCE THEY'RE HERE. AND TO MAINTAIN THE CULTURE OF CULTURES WHILE ALSO. ADAPTING TO THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED. CASTERS PATH FORWARD WHICH IS A FRAMEWORK TO CREATE. A NEW WORK ENVIRONMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL PET A PANDEMIC. AND ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN OR COMPREHENSIVE BUT THE OVERALL INTENT. IS REALLY TO CREATE AN ADAPTABLE AND RESILIENT- ORGANIZATION THAT CONTINUES TO THRIVE IN ADVANCE TO MEET ALL OF OUR OVERALL BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AT CAL STARS WITH A LOT OF THEM UNDER WAY- CURRENT YOU CAN. LOOK ACROSS THE RIVER AND SEE OUR HEADQUARTERS EXPANSION PROJECT THAT WAS- THAT IS. YOU KNOW BEING BUILT IN THE- IN THE FINAL PHASES OF COMPLETION THROUGH THIS NEXT YEAR. THAT EXPANSION PROJECT WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE BOARD IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND- IT WAS TO ADDRESS THE ORGANISATION'S GROWTH EXPECTATIONS OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. AND DUE TO INCREASING COMPLEXITIES IN OUR INVESTMENT MARKETS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR. AND THE PUBLIC PLAN ADMINISTRATION. ARE CASTERS A STAFF HAS GROWN. SINCE MOVING INTO THE WESTERN CRIMINAL HEADQUARTERS IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. AND WE REALLY- WERE OVER OCCUPIED IN OUR TOWER FACILITY- AT THE TIME AND WE WERE LOOKING TO. EXPLORE WHAT OUR EXPANSION- NEEDS WERE GOING BE FOR THE NEW BUILDING WILL BE FULL AQUI. BY STAR STAFF. AND WILL BE A MOST. AND THE REGION PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND PROMOTING HEALTH AND A COMMUNITY CONNECTIVITY. AND OVER THE SHORT TERM THE EXPANSION WILL MAKE UP MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF RENTABLE OFFICE SPACE AVAILABLE. FOR LEASE IN OUR CURRENT- TOWER RIVERFRONT BUILDING. SO AND WE THINK THAT DESPITE A PANDEMIC DIFFERENT SHIFTS IN THE- OFFICE SPACE NEEDS CUSTER'S HEADQUARTERS. IS REALLY POSITIONED TO BE AN ATTRACTIVE LEASING SPACE FOR THE SACRAMENTO DOWNTOWN AREA AND GENERATE. THIRD PARTY LEASE REVENUE FOR THE FUND. OUR LONG TERM PLANS- PROJECT CASTERS GROWTH TO FULLY OCCUPIED- BOTH BUILDINGS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DECADES. AND THEN THE OTHER PROJECT I WANTED TO MENTION WAS THE PIGEON SOLUTION PROJECT WHICH IS A MULTI YEAR PROJECT TO REPLACE OUR CURRENT PENSION ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM MINUTES UNTIL RECENT STORMS. THE PENSION SOLUTION PROJECT IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IT IT PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY- OR CASTERS SISTER THAT PENSION SOLUTION. PROJECT ALIGNS WITH OUR STRATEGIC PLAN AND DELIVERS FOR PRIMARY BENEFITS TO THE ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS OUR CUSTOMERS AND THOSE ARE ENHANCING SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS AND BENEFICIARIES ARE STAFF. AND EMPLOYERS INCREASING OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO. OUR CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS NEEDS GAIN LONG TERM OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVE OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS SO WE'RE WELL UNDERWAY AND THAT PROJECT ALTHOUGH WE'RE- LOOKING AT THE- THE CHALLENGES WITH THE TIME. THE ADDITIONAL TIME NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THAT SYSTEM. AND THEN THE OTHER- THE SMALLER BUT ITS DEFENSE JUST AS IMPORTANT RELATIVELY OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT WERE LOOKING AT- TO TRY TO ACHIEVE AN EMPLOYER REPORTING TO FINAL BENEFIT PROJECT AND- THE GOAL IS TO BETTER- TO BUILD BETTER PROCESSES SO THAT RETIRED MEMBERS CAN FEEL CONFIDENT. IN THE PEACE OF MIND AS THEY MAKE DECISIONS ON TRANSIT TRANSITION OUT OF THEIR TEACHING CAREERS IN RETIREMENT THAT THEIR BENEFITS WILL NOT ADJUST AND WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL WITH OUR- STAKEHOLDER MEMBERS AND EMPLOYER GROUPS TO FURTHER MINIMIZE THAT MINIMIZES CHANGES TO THE- MEMBERS OF BENEFITS AND WITH THE AIM OF BRINGING A CERTAINTY. AND CONSISTENCY TERM MEMBERS AND- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER SPONSORING- AB SIXTEEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH IS TO HELP ADDRESS. SOME OF THE STABILIZATION EFFORTS- AND THEN SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT I JUST WANTED TO MENTION OUR OUR RETIREMENT READINESS- SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IT DOESN'T REALLY. HAVE THE- THE BENEFIT OF EXPANDING OUR OUTREACH OR STAKEHOLDER MEMBERS WITH- BRINGING SESSIONS AND- TRAINING SESSIONS GROUP SESSIONS AND INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING SESSIONS. I'M INTO A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT WHICH BRINGS OUR REACH. YOU KNOW BRINGS THE CAPACITY TO REACH TO A GREATER. POPULATION SO WE'RE KIND OF GOING TO CONTINUE TO. EXECUTE STRATEGIES THAT BUILD UPON THAT WHILE ALSO OPENING- AND KEEPING OUR MEMBER SERVICE CENTERS OPEN AS WE TRANSITION INTO MORE OF A PHYSICAL- AND PERSON ENVIRONMENT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE STILL KNOW WAS MISSING- OR THE OUR MEMBERS MRS COMING IN AND BEING ABLE TO- INTERACT INDIVIDUALLY WITH OUR- WITH OUR COUNSELORS AND- WHILE OUR OFFICES ARE OPEN WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN. THE RESURGENT OF OUR MEMBERS I'M COMING IN AT THE RATE THAT THEY WANT TO DO IT SO THAT MAKES US BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE- AND CAPTAIN TO THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. TO GREATER DEGREE THAN WHAT WE HAD EXPECTED A PREVIOUSLY. AND JUST IN CONCLUSION I WANTED TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN SERVING CALIFORNIA EDUCATORS FOR MORE pMISSION OF SECURING THE FINANCIAL FUTURE- ENTRUST RECOVERY EDUCATORS OUR PRIORITY. IS FOR EVERY MEMBERS QUALITY OF LIFE. AFTER RETIREMENT TO BE EXACTLY. WHAT THEY EXPECTED IT TO BE A BETTER. AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR FOR ON X. THE COUNCIL FUNDING. AND MONITORING ADJUSTING TO THE A DIFFERENT FUTURE RISKS THAT ARE GOING TO BE CHALLENGING US OVER THE NEXT. YOU KNOW FEW DECADES REMAIN COMMITTED TO INVESTING RESPONSIBLY OVER THE LONG TERM- CONTINUING TO ADD VALUE TO OUR PORTFOLIO. ALL FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR CALIFORNIA EDUCATORS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND WITH THAT A HUNDRED BACK OVER TO YOU A SENATOR PURCHASING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS BOOK KNOCK AND- YOU KNOW AND ALSO MISTER ALEMAN PRESHEAF VERY MUCH- YOUR PRESENTATION. IN RESPONDING TO- SOME OF THE EARLY QUESTIONS A- THERE WERE THERE WERE ASKED HOME IN I THINK- ANTICIPATING THE FEW QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE- SO GOOD JOB WITH THAT- I KNOW WE HAVE A RIGHT TO REQUEST BE RECOGNIZED BY SOME MEMBER COOLLY SERMON ATTORNEY HIM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- YEAH THIS QUESTION RELATES TO THE GENERAL TOPIC OF DISINVESTMENT WHICH- SPOKE TO MISTRIAL MONDAY- I ACTUALLY AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH PROP TWENTY ONE THAT WAS A C. SIXTEEN WHICH IS A STAFF MEMBER IN EIGHTY THREE ACTUALLY WORKED ON- MY BOSS WAS THE AUTHOR- YOU KNOW I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS INVESTMENT I THINK WE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE OUR ROLE TO PLAY. WHICH IS FRANKLY THE UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE IDEAS IT SORT OF BRINGS TO MIND THE EXPRESSION FOOL ME ONCE SHAME ON YOU FOOL ME TWICE SHAME ON ME. YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY FOUND IT INTERESTING MISTRIAL MENU REMARKED THAT NINE TIMES. YOU HAVE UNDERTAKEN. DIVESTMENT TYPES OF DECISIONS- ANY REMARKED ON THE COLLECTIVE LOSSES THAT THAT IMPOSED ON THE SYSTEM. AND SO I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE HAVE THEY EVER BEEN. NEUTRAL HAVE THEY ALWAYS FLED THE FUND IN SOME RESPECTS BACKWARDS. BECAUSE THEN IF WE KNOW THAT IS INVARIABLY TRUE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY UNRING THAT BELL AND THAT BECOMES A PART OF WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE INVESTMENT REQUIREMENT ADDED TO THE CONSTITUTION BY PROPOSITION TWENTY ONE. HOW DOES IT RELATE THESE ISSUES NOT EVERY YOU WOULD NO LONGER DEAL WITH DISINVESTMENT CENTER CASE OF FIRST IMPRESSION AS A LAWYER YOU MIGHT REFER TO IT AS- WE'VE WE'VE SEEN A SERIES OF THEM THEY HAVE A CERTAIN. TYPE OF CONSEQUENCE AND I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE NOTE OF THAT SO- HAS THERE EVER BEEN A DISTANT A DISINVESTMENT TYPE OF PROGRAM THAT HAS RESULTED IN. A SENSE OF GAIN TO THE SYSTEM. THANK YOUR PRESENT A PROOF CENTER CALLING FOR THAT QUESTION- AND I WANT TO CORRECT I IF I MISSPOKE- WE DIVEST AND WE'VE DIVESTITURE GAINS IN THE LAST TWENTY TWO YEARS- YOU WOULD THINK THAT SOME OF THOSE MIGHT BE A BREAK EVEN WITH THE BEST OF COAL. BOTH US AND NON US- WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A VERY SOLID DECISION- BUT UNFORTUNATELY- THE PASS TO ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON CAME ALONG AND- COLE JUMPED. IN USE- AND IT IT IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST ONE OF THE- SIX THEY WOULD GO TO- BREAK EVEN- THE OTHER THAT WE THOUGHT MADE SENSE WAS- WE DIVEST OF FIREARMS- COMPANIES THAT SELL PARTS. THAT ARE ILLEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT WAS ONLY TWO STOCKS- BUT THERE AGAIN- UNFORTUNATELY BEEN SALES WENT THROUGH THE ROUGH- IN DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND THEN LASTLY ANOTHER ONE I WOULD SAY THAT WAS PROBABLY OUR LAST INVESTMENT IF I RECALL CORRECTLY- WE DIVESTITURE OF TWO PRIVATE PRISON COMPANIES- AND- WHILE THERE WAS A BIG PUSH TO STOP DOING BUSINESS- PEOPLE HAVEN'T- AND THOSE STOCKS- UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THE MARKETS ARE SO STRONG- A RISING TIDE RAISES ALL BOATS EVEN ONES THAT MIGHT BE WEAK LIKE THOSE STOCKS AND THEY WENT UP IN VALUE. SO THERE ARE LEAST OF THOSE THREE OF THE SIX I WOULD SAY OUR BREAK EVEN THE CHALLENGE I GUESS I WOULD RACE TO YOU IS THAT I THINK WE WHEN YOU WANT US TO TAKE ACTION. AND DIVEST MANY OF THOSE DO NOT HAVE A SUNSET CLAUSE AND SO ON PARTICULARLY ON IRAN AND SUDAN SUDAN DID START TO GET BETTER AND AT LEAST SEPARATED. BUT WE WOULD NOT HAVE INVESTED BACK IN COMPANIES THAT WERE DOING BUSINESS WITH SOUTH SUDAN BECAUSE THE LOG SYSTEM SO. IT'S A TOUGH INSTRUMENT IT'S A HARD DEBATE I DID IT AND THEN- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON PROP TWENTY ONE IT'S BEEN MY ENTIRE CAREER- WORKING. IN CALIFORNIA. PENSIONS- IT'S A DISCUSS ABOUT HOW TO BRING ABOUT THE RATE CHANGE AND I JUST WANTED HER TO DIVEST MAN IS AN INVESTMENT DECISION- IT HAS NOT AFFECTED SOCIAL CHANGE. YES PLEASE JUST BY WAY I MAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO SAY. I ASKED THE QUESTION TO INFORM HOW WE IN THE LEGISLATURE DELIBERATE UPON THESE MATTERS. ALL WE DO SET THE POLICY WE GIVE DIRECTION. YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS US TO DO IS TO THINK DEEPLY ABOUT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THINGS. SO I THINK. ARE VERY STRINGENT SYSTEMS OPERATE A PROP TWENTY ONE VIOLENT YOU DO THE BEST YOU CAN- I WAS I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THEY JUST SORT OF IN LARGE MY FRAMEWORK ON THESE MATTERS. AND THAT OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO I THINK YOU VERY MUCH VERY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR WORK AND YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SO EVER END IN BEFORE WE GO ON- JUST ANOTHER ANNOUNCEMENT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC COMMENT- KEY TO DIAL IN THE TOLL FREE NUMBER IS EIGHT FOUR FOUR. TWO NINE ONE. ACCESS CODE IS FOUR SIX. SIX THREE NINE SIX EIGHT. IF YOU DIAL IN NOW- YOU'LL BE- TO BE QUEUED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WHICH WILL BE OCCURRING AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE WITH QUESTION ANSWER ON THIS PANEL. SO THANK YOU IN BACK TO QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS UNTIL COOPER. THANK YOU MR CHAIR- I DON'T THINK MR ALLMAN FIRST CANNED OR TENDER- YOU KNOW CAL STIRS NINE POINT EIGHT BILLION IN LOSSES- THE CAL STARS AS DIVERSE AS SIX TIMES IT DOESN'T CREATE SOCIAL CHANGE IN IN FOR FOLKS TO THINK ABOUT THAT I DROPPERS FOR YEARS NOW. AND I CURRENTLY CHAIR PERSON THE ASSEMBLY- CALIFORNIA RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- I HAD THE MOST RETIREES IN THE SECRETARY MY DISTRICT IN THE MOST ACTIVE. PERSON PLEASE IT'S ABOUT RETIREMENT GETTING THERE ON THE GROUND THE CAPITOL EMPLOYEES THAT WORKERS ARE EMPLOYEES THIS IS THE MAKE SURE WE SECURE THEIR FUTURE THAT THEY WERE PROMISED FOR RETIREES. TO SECURE THE FUTURE PROMISED EVERY YEAR THERE'S FOUR FIVE BILLS ON THE VESTMENT THAT COME BEFORE COMMITTEE IT'S RUSSIA IS CHINA'S BELARUS ISRAEL TURKEY. DIVEST FROM FIREARMS TOBACCO COAL PRIVATE PRISONS- IT'S TOUGH YOU KNOW PEOPLE STILL USE GAS THAT'S THE BIG FOSSIL FUEL ISSUE IN YOU REALLY DIG INTO THINGS AND DELVE DEEP INTO IT- CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL I BELIEVE IN IT. IT TAKES TIME- THE MANAGER KARA CALIFORNIA'S FOURTEEN YEARS OLD LAWFUL TO OUR CAR PAYMENT THEY CAN AFFORD EVEY THEY CAN AFFORD THE INSURANCE HOW DO WE DO WITH THOSE FOLKS THINK ABOUT THAT SO. LIKE I SAID I'M I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT IT BUT ALSO TO BE REALISTIC WE IMPOSE SO MUCH ON CALIFORNIANS IT IS EXPENSIVE TO LIVE HERE BECAUSE THE THINGS THE LAW SWEEP THE THINGS WE DO THE LAWS WE PASS AND THAT'S THAT'S THE TOUGH PART ABOUT IT SO. THIS HEARING IS BEEN GOOD IT'S BEEN REFRESHING TO HEAR SOME SOME CANDOR- FROM THE FOLKS IN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS. AND THAT'S WHERE IT COMES DOWN TO WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION THOSE FOLKS ARE RETIRED ALREADY IN THOSE FUTURE EMPLOYEES ARE EMPLOYEES IN THE BUILDING WHICH NUMBER A GREAT DEAL AND THE OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES TO MAKE SURE- THEY GET WITH THEIR PROMISE SO. THAT BE VERY JUDICIOUS IN HOW WE APPLY THIS AND RIGHT NOW IT'S THAT THE VESTMENT MILK. GUNS ARE STILL AROUND PEOPLE LIKE FIREARMS. DEMOCRATS INTO. ENDED UP. SO WE'VE A VERY. AND WE PERCEIVE ON THIS THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU MR ISSUE YOUR COMMENTS- LET ME IT IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO QUESTION COMING FROM FOR LET ME JUST SAY IN IN I DON'T THINK THIS IS NECESSARILY- AN ALTERNATIVE POINT OF VIEW BUT I THINK WHAT. IS GOING ON WILL CONTINUE GOING THE LEGISLATURE IS- THERE'S A COST IS THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHETHER OR NOT- IN THE CASE OF CLIMATE FOR EXAMPLE LET ME JUST SAY. I HAVEN'T TAKEN A POSITION ON CURRENT LEGISLATION ON THE INVESTMENT AROUND CLIMATE BUT- WHEN ON THE DAY THAT I WAS SWORN INTO OFFICE ALONG WITH- MY VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE DECEMBER SEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY- IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT DAY THAT CALIFORNIA. ECONOMIC DAMAGE TO TWO. WILDFIRES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION- IN- JUST. A RECENTLY. NATIONAL ESTIMATES ON FIRE DAMAGE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR SEVENTY BILLION. MORE THAN HALF OF WHICH ABOUT FORTY FIVE BILLION WAS IN CALIFORNIA AND SO I THINK WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE AREN'T NECESSARILY LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT- THE DIVESTMENT HAS EFFECTUATED CHANGE WITHIN. WITHIN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM ITSELF- OR WHETHER THAT HAS. LED TO- GLOBAL CHANGE BUT I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS WE HAVE NOT ONLY CONSTITUENCIES BUT A SENSE OF VALUES TAT SAYS WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE CAN ABOUT CLIMATE. IT'S EXISTENTIAL AND THE COST TO THE STATE OF DOING. NOTHING WOULD BE IN THIS CASE. IN IN THE WORST YEAR WE HAD A HUNDRED ALMOST A HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS SO I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT'S ATTACHED TO THAT FOR ME. IT IS IT SEEMS IT SEEMS IT SEEMS THERE'S TWO WAYS FOR THE PENSION FUNDS TO HANDLE THESE QUESTIONS- HE ONE IS. TO SAY WE'RE JUST YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO OPPOSE. DIVESTMENT BILLS ARE GONNA TRY TO TALK PEOPLE DOWN FROM FROM THE CLIFF SO TO SPEAK ANOTHER WAY IS TO SIT IN A MAYBE AND MAYBE THIS IS BOTH HAND IS TO SAY. WE ANTICIPATE EITHER BY LEGISLATIVE MANDATE OR BY ATTRITION- THAT THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY IS GOING TO DECLINE OR THAT OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN HOUSTON GOING TO DECLINE AND WHAT IS THAT CRITICAL PATH LOOK LIKE I DON'T THINK I'VE YET HEARD TODAY ANYONE COME FORWARD AND SAY- WE'RE NOT PARTICULARLY KEEN ON DIVESTMENT. IMMEDIATE DIVESTMENT WE DON'T THINK IT'S PRACTICAL WE DON'T THINK IT'S EFFECTIVE BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS BUSINESS AND HERE'S HERE'S HERE'S- HOW WE CAN DO THAT. HERE'S A CRITICAL PATH IT'S TEN YEARS OF DECLINE INVESTMENT IN THIS SPACE OR IT'S TWENTY YEARS- I'M NOT HEARING THAT AND I JUST WANTED TO ASK. EITHER OF OUR CURRENT PRESENTERS WHETHER OR NOT THAT KIND OF WORK IS ACTUALLY BEING DONE INDIA HAVE. CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR MOVING OUT OF. INVESTMENTS THAT ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COSTLY FOR SOCIETY. HE RESPECTABLE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES. I'LL JUMP IN AND TURN IT OVER TO CALPERS AFTER THAT THAT'S RIGHT. THANK. I'LL GO AHEAD MY NAME IS CHRIS HIM AGAIN- ABSOLUTELY SIR WE'RE VERY ACTIVE BOTH WE AND HERS ARE ACTIVE IN TRYING TO GET OUR PORTFOLIOS TO NET ZERO WHAT THAT MEANS IS NOT JUST GETTING FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES TO STOP DRILLING FOR OIL BUT TO GET THEM TO CHANGE THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY TRANSITION I AGREE WITH SENATOR COOPER'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE PRICE OF AUTOMOBILES BUT AS I SAID IT'S EVERYWHERE SO WE WANT TO REDUCE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF OUR TWO PORTFOLIOS STEADILY OVER TIME BUT A BIG PART OF THAT IS TO GET FORD AND GM TO MAKE MORE EASY. IS TO GET ALL THE ELECTRICITY MANUFACTURERS ARE PROBABLY THE ELECTRICITY GENERATORS AND UTILITIES IN THE COUNTRY TO SHIFT AWAY FROM COAL AND FROM OIL AND GAS- AND GO TO HYDROGEN AND OTHER RENEWABLE SOURCES BUT THAT CAN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO EXPENSIVE IT'S GOT TO BE A STEADY TRANSITION- AND WE FRANKLY I'VE GOT TO GET THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AND THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY OF TEXAS TO BE WILLING TO SHIFT AWAY FROM WHAT'S BEEN THEIR BREAD AND BUTTER OVER TO OTHER AREAS AND IT'S HARD TO TURN A BIG SHIP LIKE EXXON MOBIL BUT WE DID IT BY CHANGING THE TOP. AND GETTING THEM TO START TALKING ABOUT NET ZERO IN TWENTY FIFTY THEY'RE NOT MAKING PLANS FAST ENOUGH GRANTED BUT THEY ARE MAKING A CHANGE LOOK AT WHAT SHELL CHEVRON IS DOING IN TRYING TO BUY INTO A GREEN DIESEL SO PEOPLE REALIZE AND THESE COMPANIES REALIZE IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE IN THE FUTURE THEY'VE GOT TO CHANGE IF THEY DON'T CHANGE YES HER SISTERS WILL BE COMPELLED TO HAVE TO SELL THOSE STOCKS IF WE WANT TO REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT. BUT THAT'S GOING TO ENTAIL A RISK. IF THE REST OF THE HAS SHIFTED. AND WE ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE ARE LIVING CLOSER TO NET ZERO. THEY WERE TAKING WHO DRESSED AND WE'RE PREDICTING THE FUTURE. AND THAT INVOLVES A CHALLENGE. SO THAT'S PROBABLY TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE NOT TODAY BUT YOU HAVE TO START ON THAT TRIP TODAY IF YOU WANT TO GET TO ZERO BY TWENTY FIFTY OR EARLIER. IT'S GOT TO BEGIN TODAY. YEAH I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT- AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT IF YOU DON'T GET TO KNOW ZERO. AND DON'T MEAN YOU WE- BUT THAT TIME FRAME. YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE PENSION FUND BECAUSE IT'S AN ISSUE OF. OF HUMANITY SURVIVING BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY ALL I WAS ASKING FOR IS WHERE'S YOUR- THIRTY YEAR PLAN YOUR TWENTY YEAR PLAN WERE. THERE'S BILLS LEGISLATION THERE'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO WRAP UP THE EV'S. TO TOLD EMANATE- THE SALE OF GAS POWERED VEHICLES HERE LAST YEAR THERE WAS A BILL THAT ACTUALLY GOT SIGNED INTO LAW THE ELIMINATING- GASPAR GARDEN TOOLS WITH YOU AGREE WITH THAT OR NOT I'M NOT EVEN ASKING A QUESTION. OR THE AGREE WITH WHETHER OR NOT CALIFORNIA ITSELF CAN. CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BY DOING THOSE THINGS- WHAT IS YOUR PLAN DO YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE- AN ACTUAL RAMP DOWN PLAN IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS. YOU KNOW THE FOLKS THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN ARE MOVING QUICKLY ENOUGH- SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GET HIM TO DO THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S- THAT'S PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE FUNCTION THAT'S OUR JOB IF THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO- TO MOVE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION- BUT I DON'T. I'M A I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE'S NOT A PERIL OF PLAN THAT I'M HEARING- YOU KNOW IN THE PENSION FUNDS IN. A IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING THROUGH IT YOU'RE DOING THE WORK BUT IF THERE IS SUCH A PLAN AGAIN I THINK I'D BE A GREAT THING TO DISTRIBUTE- YOU KNOW TO ALL OF US SO WE CAN. WE CAN SEE IT MAY TEMPER. OR A CAR BECAUSE PEOPLE TO ADJUST- THE KIND OF LEGISLATION TO BRING IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND TO TRY TO TIE IT TO THE KIND OF TIME LINE SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY. MORE COMFORTABLE WITH- THEM AT THE SCHOOL YOU LEANING IN THAT YOU WANT TO COMMENT AGAIN. I DO AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THEY CAN DO MORE BUT LIKE THIS HE SAID IF THE WORLD HAS A SHIFT AWAY. AND A GOOD EXAMPLE THE BIGGEST INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE. SO CARD SAYS YOU CANNOT USE THIS TRY ACTOR IN CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU CAN USE IT IN ELSE IN THE WORLD- THE- KIND. THAT THAT IS NONSENSE. BECAUSE THAT JUST DRIVES UP PRICES IN CALIFORNIA SO. I THINK IT'S BEEN-FORCED DOWN BY THE LEGISLATURE THE PUBLIC. ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE THINGS I THINK- PERSON STARS IN THE REST EIGHTY FIVE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS. CAN DO TO FIGURE OUT HERE OUR GOALS. HOW TO GET THERE AND I THINK THEY CAN DO THAT MAYBE THEY'VE SHOWN THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN INSTEAD OF YOU HAVE IT FORCED DOWN THEIR THROAT WITH THAT AND A BAG WITH IT WITH THE CHERRY IT'S I'D LOVE TO HEAR THEIR IDEAS. HOW WE GET THERE I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT AND THERE'S GONNA BE SOME MIDDLE GROUND ON THIS SO GREAT COMMENTS. THANK YOU SURE COOPER IN- I THINK IT'S BEEN A GOOD DISCUSSIONS AND INFORMATIVE- I WILL SAY BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS TODAY WE KNEW WE HAD TO. A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT OF HEARING TODAY BUT I THINK- A LOT OF GOOD- POLICY ISSUES HAVE ALSO SURFACED- FOR THE PRESIDIO WITHIN OUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES- I'M GONNA MAKE- SOME ABBREVIATED CLOSING REMARKS- BUT I WANT TO GIVE. YOUR COOPER CHANCE TO DO SO FIRST AND THEN WE'LL SWITCH RIGHT OVER TO. PUBLIC COMMENT SO WE CAN- SWING THROUGH THE ROOM. I STILL THINK THE PANELISTS BEING WITH TODAY TO PROVIDE INSIGHT THE WORK THAT YOU DO TO MINISTER THE RETIREMENT THE COMPLEXITY MINISTRATION AND WHAT IT TAKES TO ENSURE FINANCIAL SECURITY IN RETIREMENT. RETIREES WHO RELY ON YOUR EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE TO ENSURE THAT THEIR PENSION PROMISES MAINTAIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND LET ME FORMALLY ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US THINK THE LAST- PANELISTS ON US AGAIN CEMEX WE GIVE AND TAKE THERE WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION IS GREATLY APPRECIATE HIS SIDING- SOME OF THE CURRENT LEGISLATION THAT'S AROUND THAT MAY- MITIGATE IMPACT ON ON FOLKS IN TERMS OF INFLATION AND- AND SOME OTHER ISSUES SO- WE THANK EVERYONE TODAY FOR PARTICIPATING WE UNDERSTAND. THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THIS WORK- IN THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROMISE WE MADE TO PEOPLE. WHO DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO SERVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS REALLY ULTIMATELY THE BENEFICIARIES OF ALL THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING- WITHIN THE PENSION FUNDS AND IN OUR INTENTIONS TO BUT TO TRY TO HELP AND BE SUPPORTIVE. HOWEVER WE CAN AS A LEGISLATURE- I WANT TO- MOVED DOWN TO TWO PUBLIC COMMENT- IN THAT WILL. ESSENTIALLY BE HOW WE CLOSE SO I WILL ADJOURN AFTER THE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT- I WILL THINK OF ALL THOSE SPEAKERS- ONCE THEY'RE DONE AND- BEFORE WE GO TO THE MODERATOR- WE- NOW WILL GO TO THE GALLERY- I'M TOLD AND I CAN KIND OF SEE FROM HERE THAT WE HAVE- FOLKS HAVE BEEN WAITING TO SPEAK FROM THE GALLERY- WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT PUBLIC SPEAKING. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FOLKS ARE ARE ON- THE TELECOM IT'S WINE- I WAS ANTICIPATING ALLOWING ABOUT TEN MINUTES TOTAL THERE SO WE'RE GONNA JUST ASK EVERYONE TO LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO ONE MINUTE- PLEASE TRY TO ABIDE BY THAT IF YOU CAN'T THANK YOU AND- PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND PERCY. GOOD MR CHAIR AND CHAIR COOPER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SANDY EMERSON AND I'M A CLIMATE ACTIVIST FROM BERKELEY. THE SUDDEN LOSS OF VALUE OF INVESTMENTS IN RUSSIA SHOWS HOW QUICKLY ASSETS CAN BECOME STRANDED THE CRISIS IN UKRAINE HAS BROUGHT GLOBAL SANCTIONS AGAINST VLADIMIR PUTIN AND HIS ON JUST WAR AS USUAL THE MOST SEVERE IMPACTS WILL BE FELT BY PEOPLE WHO WANT NO PART OF THIS WAR. BUT THE FACT THAT RUSSIA DEPEND SO HEAVILY ON SALES OF ITS FOSSIL FUELS HAS THROWN ITS ECONOMY INTO CHAOS. THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT OF THE WAR HEIGHTENS THE URGENCY OF WINDING DOWN INVESTMENTS IN FOSSIL FUELS IN AN ORDERLY FASHION BEFORE THERE'S A CRISIS. PENSION FUND SHOULD NOT BE THE HOLDERS OF LAST RESORT FOR TOXIC FOSSIL FUEL INVESTMENTS. AS THE GOVERNOR SAID LAST NIGHT WE MUST END OUR DEPENDENCE ON PETRO STATES INCLUDING THE PLANET SIZED SPHERE OF INFLUENCE OF THE OIL MAJORS WHO SEEK TO PERPETUATE THEIR DESTRUCTIVE BUSINESS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IS NOT AFFECTED THE GASOLINE INDUSTRY THAT SEEKS TO GROW ENDLESSLY AND RELENTLESSLY AND IS AS DEADLY AS ANY DICTATOR. ASKING FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES TO START PRODUCING FOSSIL FUELS IS NOT GOING TO GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. BOTH CALPERS AND CAL STIRS HAVE PLEDGED TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO BY TWENTY FIFTY IN ORDER TO LIMIT GLOBAL TEMPERATURE RISE TO ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS MEETING THAT CARBON BUDGETMEANS THAT 90% OF COAL AND 60% OF BOTH OIL AND GAS HAS TO STAY IN THE GROUND. YOU CAN'T SELL IT IN OUR PENSION FUNDS SHOULDN'T GET STUCK OWNING IT I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU TO WRAP UP PLEASE. WITH THE UKRAINE CRISIS JUST LIKE THAT THE INVESTMENT LANDSCAPE CHANGED. LIKE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF LARGE ASSET OWNERS CALPERS AND CAL STIRS CAN TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DIVEST FROM FOSSIL FUELS IN AN ORDERLY FASHION. AND ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION TO A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND CULTURE COOPER MY NAME IS GLEN SHIEL BEN I AM A CALPERS MEMBER. I'M ALSO AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND A CLIMATE ACTIVIST. FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND ESPECIALLY THIS WEEK. THE STRATEGY OF HOLDING ON TO FOSSIL FUEL INVESTMENTS LOOKS LIKE A GOOD IDEA. THIS MORNING I HEARD THAT A PRICE THAT A BARREL OR OIL IS NOW SELLING FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS. AND THE FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES ARE MAKING BIG PROFITS SO IT LOOKS LIKE A RESPONSIBLE DECISION TO HOLD ON TO THESE ASSETS. BUT ALSO THIS WEEK ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN KNOCKED FROM THE HEADLINES BY PUTIN'S TERRIBLE MISADVENTURE IN UKRAINE. HUMAN LIFE AS WELL AS MOST OTHER LIFE ON EARTH IS IN SUCH TROUBLE AS TO DESCRIBE DESCRIPTION. AUSTRALIA THIS WEEK IS EXPERIENCING THE WORST FLOODS IN ITS ENTIRE HISTORY. AFTER SOME OF ITS WORST FIRES RESIDENTS OF PLACES LIKE PHOENIX AND MIAMI NOT TO MENTION LARGE SWATHS OF PAKISTAN INDIA AND AFRICA. WILL BE TRYING TO LIVE THROUGH DEADLY HEAT WAVE HEAT WAVES. WITH OVER A HUNDRED DAYS A YEAR OF DEADLY HEAT THE BARRIER REEF WILL BE MOSTLY IF NOT COMPLETELY GONE IN DECADES. WORST OF ALL THE POPULATIONS OF SMALL CREATURES THAT FEED EVERYTHING HIGHER ON THE FOOD CHAIN INCLUDING US ARE COLLAPSING AS WE SPEAK. INSECT POPULATIONS HAVE DECLINED BY ABOUT 70% WHICH- LEADS TO A BLEAK FUTURE FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. FOR MARINE ANIMALS FOR BIRDS FOR EVERYTHING IN SHORT THAT WE DEPEND ON. I MEAN I HAVE TO ASK YOU TO WRAP UP I APOLOGIZE JUST STORES FARED EVERYONE WE'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH. I'M SORRY I CAN HEAR YOU YES WE CAN HEAR YOU OKAY WE ESTABLISHED A ONE MINUTE A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD PER SPEAKER SO JUST ASKING YOU TO WRAP UP. OKAY I ASK YOU AND THANK YOU GERMAN CORTESE FOR QUESTION TO CONSIDER THE EFFECTS ON INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE TOURIST INDUSTRY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THE SKI INDUSTRY THE RECALL STATE INDUSTRY AND VERY MUCH ELSE I THINK YOUR POINT WAS WELL TAKEN THAT A COLLAPSE IN THE CLIMATE IS JEOPARDIZING ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE CALPERS PORTFOLIO AND I THINK I'M BEING ASKED TO QUIT SO I WILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. HELLO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR ATTENTION FOR BEING HERE WE APPRECIATE THE PUBLIC COMMENTS OR ANYONE ELSE IN THE GALLERY THAT WISHES TO SPEAK I SEE NONE- ORGAN TURN THE MODERATOR ANNOUNCED THAT- PHONE LINE A COUPLE OF TIMES- LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK AGAIN IF THERE IS- THERE'S STILL A ONE MINUTE LIMIT PER SPEAKER.
