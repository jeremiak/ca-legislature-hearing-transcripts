THANK YOU REFER OPEN IT UP TO. THIS DEPARTMENT FINANCE OR L. A. ILL HAVE ANY COMMENTS MAKE. YOU CAN. THOUSAND HE WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. FOR THE LAKERS MAR TH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. NO COMMENTS THIS TIME. HEY THANK YOU HAVE A THE PRESENT I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND CONCERN IN SOME OF THE MEMBERS ALSO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- I'M GONNA START OFF BY ASKING WE'VE YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE'S TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FEWER PEOPLE IN PRISON NOW THAN IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. AND THIRTY SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SAVINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE DECREASE IN THE PRISON POPULATION AND HOW THE DEPARTMENT IS REDIRECTING THE SAVINGS- AND WHAT KIND OF ON GOING SAVINGS ARE YOU ANTICIPATING. YEAH THIS IS A ERIC SWANSON I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF US JUST GO SERVICES AT CDC- WE HAVE. THE SAVING ASSOCIATE WITH HER- POPPING DECREASE. I'M A LOT OF THE SAVINGS THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED WE'VE HAD TO. READER TO CALL IT UP AGAIN EFFORTS. ARE SO FAR BY IS A LOW IS CERTAIN. ALISON IN THE IN HER INITIAL CALL. HOW SOME OF THE SAVINGS THAT WE MANAGE TO. OKAY ON TO THE NEXT OF MEDICAID EFFORTS THAT WE ARE. A INSIDE THE PRISONS. THAT THE ALL THE SAVINGS TO LETTER DO WE A BREAK. AND DO WE HAVE ANTICIPATION FOR OF DOWN THE ROAD HELLO FABIAN'S MIGHT BE USED. YEAH I CAN PROVIDE YOU IF YOU WANT I CAN PROVIDE YOUR STAFF WITH THE BREAKDOWN OF- OF THE SAVINGS THAT WE ARE ANTICIPATED TO RECEIVE FROM THOSE THAT WE- ARE REDIRECTED TO COPE WITH MEDICATION. THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED I HOPE AS WE CONTINUE THE WORK WE LOOK AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. THAT WE DEFINITELY HAVE BEING CHALLENGED WITH AND I KNOW THAT THAT REALITY CHANGES ON US EVERY DAY- BUT I HOPE THAT WOULD ALSO START THINKING LONG TERM AND PLANNING AHEAD- ALONG THE WAY. I WITH THE SAME WITH THE SAME A LINE OF QUESTIONING WE HAVE SEEN A DECREASE IN THE PRISON POPULATION- AND DOWN 20% CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE. ON WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTING FOR ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO BE RELEASED EACH MONTH. DUE TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AS WE CONTINUE. SO OURONGOING EFFORTS- AND I DID FAILED TO MENTION IN MY OPENING COMMENTS ABOUT OUR TWELVE WEEK PASTA PROGRAMMING CREDIT THAT WAS AFFORDED TO ALL OFFENDERS THAT WERE NOT. A LOT FOR CONTEMPT. WE ARE CONTINUING WITH OUR SIX MONTH TO RELEASE ONGOING. AND WE ALSO CONTINUE- WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME INDETERMINATE LEAST SENTENCED OFFENDERS LOOKING AT THAT PROCESS TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY RELIEF. EVERY ALL THE HIGH RISK MEDICAL CASES- THE MAJORITY OF THE HIGHER RISK MEDICAL CASES THE MISTER DS AND I BOTH DID FOR I DETERMINE THE STEPS THAT WE- DIFFERENT THAT ENDED. SO WE ARE IN AT FAST- AS FAR AS ESTIMATES. ESTIMATES I WOULD SAY I WOULD HAVE TO GET YOU SPECIFIC NUMBERS AS IT RELATES TO THAT. I MEAN I CAN TELL YOU HOW MANY WE HAVE GOING ON ON ANY GIVEN MONTH. BUT INTEL WE- CLEAR THE BACK. OF OUR INTAKE I THINK IT'S GOOD IT'S TO BE HARD FOR TO WITHOUT SHORT OF RESEARCH TO. SHOULD BE TO PROVIDE YOU THAT. FOR SO I GUESS THAT'S AS WITH READING ABOUT PLANNING ONE TO RELEASE- THESE INDIVIDUALS MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT RE ENTRY SUPPORT ON THE BACKEND. I THINK SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE PLANNING BOTH PIECES SO THAT WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL LONG TERM. SO I THINK AT WE WOULD APPRECIATE SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE TO BE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THANK YOU AND I WILL SAY THAT- ALL THEIR FIRST RELEASES DID NOT NECESSARILY COME WITH A COUPLE HUNDRED OF SUPPORT HOWEVER THE JULY FIRST THROUGH PRESIDENT RELEASES ARE RECEIVING SUPPORT THROUGH OUR STOP PROGRAMS THROUGH OUR PAROLE DIVISION- AS WELL AS SOME FUNDING FROM A GRANT FROM THE SEC WE RECEIVED A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FOR LATCH AND THOSE I WILL SAY THAT. WE HAVE A LOT OF OFFENDERS IN THOSE BEDS AND I THINK IT'S MADE OF A MARKET DIFFERENCE AND- FIVE HOPEFULLY WILL TAKE A MARKET DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOMES. OF A DEFENDER SO LEAST THEY HAVE A NICE LANDING SPOT OF VERSATA IS BEING- ALBUM SHOOT DIRECTLY OUT TO THE COMMUNITY WITH NO HOUSING SUPPORT. SO CITED A THAT THE BEEN A TO- OFFENDERS WITH THAT OFFER. CAN TWENTY EIGHTH IN JULY WE DON'T HAVE ANY SERVICES THE REAR FOR THE IN THE FROM END ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IN EVERY TRACKING THEM NOW OR THE TH WE'VE- LOST TRACK OF THEM COMPLETELY. NO AND I'M SORRY OKAY SO INITIAL WE SHOULD MAKE IT. FOR ALL- THEY WERE ABOUT TWENTY HUNDRED OFFENDERS RELEASED EARLY. DOES HI THIS SO ARE WORLD IF THEY FOR PAROLE THEY WERE A TO GO TO PRO. IF NOT THEY HAVE THE WORK FOR POST RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION THEY HAVE TO GO INTO ONE OF THEIR PROGRAMS THAT ARE RUN BY THE COUNTIES IN JULY WE STOOD UP THE- THE SEC MONIES WE DIDN'T CARE WHERE THEY WERE GOING WHETHER THEY WERE GOING TO PAROLE SUPERVISION OUR COMMUNITY SUPERVISION THEY WERE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS PROGRAM SO IT REALLY BROKE DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE ACCESSING PROGRAMS THAT I REALLY DO THINK THAT THAT'S MADE OF MODIFICATION. EARTH AND WE HAVE AND I HAVE EXACT NUMBERS OF FISH WHICH IS TO PAY THOSE PROGRAMS TODAY I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO FIND IT NOW. SO- I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS BUT I'M GONNA OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES BEFORE I AM. THAT'S MY QUESTIONS. MR STONE. THANK YOU JUST. TRYING TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN AND I REALIZE THIS IS THIS IS TOP LEVEL BUT STAYING WITH THE TOP LEVEL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE SAYING AND I THINK WE DEFINITELY NEED TO SEE. THE DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COVERT RESPONSE BECAUSE- WE'VE BEEN TRACKING YEAR TO YEAR. THE EXPECTED SAVINGS OUT OF THE BUDGET BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION IN THE POPULATION. AND WE'RE SEEING ADDITIONAL DEBT REDUCTION OF POPULATION BECAUSE OF CODE BUT ALSO ADDITIONAL EXPENSES SO FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TRACK YEAR TO YEAR AND UNDERSTAND HOW. WHAT THE TRENDS ARE AND WHETHER WE'RE ON TRACK WE NEED TO SEE THOSE EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES. PULLED OUT. WHICH IS LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT YOU GAVE US. GOING THAT NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR WHICH IS THE PROPOSED BUDGET. FROM. 201-922-2020 ONE BUDGET WENT UP. BUDGET POSITIONS WHAT UP AND THE PRISON POPULATION STAYED ABOUT THE SAME FLIGHT DROP BUT LOOKING FOR FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE ENACTED TO THE PROPOSED BUDGET WE'RE SEEING THE TOTAL BUDGET. NOT REALLY CHANGING THAT MUCH BUT A SEVENTY DAY BUT THE POPULATION IS 77% OF WHAT IT HAD BEEN. AND THE BUDGET POSITIONS OR OR 95% OF WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN. SO I THINK WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. IF WE'RE GOING TO BECAUSE AND A LOT OF YOUR COSTS ARE ARE TAKEN UP IN PERSONNEL COSTS. SO AS WE'RE TRACKING THE REDUCTION IN. THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE ARE OF COURSE RATED. WE NEED TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT IMPACT IS WITH THE BUDGET POSITIONS SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SAVINGS IS. BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING A REAL REDUCTION IN THE PUT THE OF THE POPULATION BUT NOT A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE BUDGET POSITIONS IT'S REALLY HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE GETTING THE EFFICIENCIES THAT WE'RE- EXPECTING TO GET OUT OF IT AND THEN ADD ON TOP OF THAT OF COURSE THE PRISON CLOSURES WHICH WE'RE GONNA SEE. ADDED AT A DIFFERENT HEARING. DOES ALL TAKEN TOGETHER OUR LITTLE LITTLE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WITH THAT THE LIMITED INFORMATION THAT WE'VE- HAD HERE TODAY SO THAT'S WHAT I'M REQUESTING IS TO SEE. IF WE CAN GET THE PUBLIC RESPONSE MONEY TAKEN OUT OF THIS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SOME SENSE OF IT AND THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT THE PLAN IS FOR MANAGING THE BUDGET POSITION SO THAT WE CAN SEE HOW THE DROP AS WE'RE CLOSING PRISONS AND AS- THE AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION IS THE DAILY POPULATION IS. WHERE THE OVERALL PRISON POPULATION IS DROPPING IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO SEE WHAT THOSE SAVINGS ARE. GOING TO LOOK LIKE OVER TIME. HI THIS IS ALLISON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEY JUST WANT IT I CAME IN HERE WITH A BIT OF A CLARIFYING POINTS SO WE HAVE CALCULATED AS OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN POPULATION SAVINGS THAT WOULD IT BE REDIRECTED TO COVERT RESPONSE. UNDER SECRETARY MENTIONS THAT WE'RE ESTIMATING BETWEEN NINETEEN TWENTY AND CURRENT YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS I'M INTO THE TO SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH POPULATION SAVINGS WOULD BE REDIRECTED TO COPE IN RESPONSE WHICH STILL LEAVES A GAP I'M WHICH WERE STILL GOING TO. WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION STILL GOING TO BE LOOKING AT IN ADDITION TO TRYING TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE I'M BUT I JUST WANTED TO CHIME IN WITH THAT FIGURE IN CASE IT'S HELPFUL TO YOU IT IS IT IS GOING OUT- AND CALLED OUT. AND IN THE BUDGET DOCUMENTS BUT HAPPY. TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THERE. WELL IF IT IS BUT I'M ALSO LOOK. AT THE OVERALL N. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS IT IS A VERY SMALL DROP IN THE IN THE BUDGET AND PART OF THAT AS WAS EXPLAINED IS BECAUSE OF THE COVERT EXPENSES. SO IF WHICH I GUESS IS OKAY IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT AND THEN. RECOGNIZE WHAT THE SPECIFIC COVERED EXPENSES ARE IN DEFICIT THAT OUT. OKAY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING. INFORMATION THAT WE CAN TRACK AND SEE SO THAT WE CAN SEPARATE THE COVERT RESPONSE. N. IN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REDUCTIONS ARE EVEN WHEN WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THESE TOP LEVEL POSITIONS OR THESE TOP LEVEL KIND OF SUMMARIES. BECAUSE YOU JUST LOOK AT. THE DAILY POPULATION AND ITS DROP AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET POSITIONS AND THE TOTAL BUDGET THEY'RE NOT DROPPING AT THE SAME LEVEL. THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO AND THAT'S FINE BUT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALL OF THOSE RELATE TOGETHER. I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO SEE. WHAT MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND THEN WE CAN DIFFERENTIATE THE COVERT EXPENSES. OVER THE THIS YEAR. BUDGET HERE LAST YEAR WHENEVER THOSE ARE ARE RELATED AND UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE ARE BEING IMPACTED WHERE WERE MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS WHERE THOSE- DO WHERE THOSE ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE SAVINGS WE WOULD OTHERWISE EXPECT. JUST THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF KIND OF THE TRACK THAT WERE ON. THANK YOU AND I DID SOME QUICK MATH AND WE HAVE AN OVER 20% DECLINE IN THE PRISON POPULATION BUT- ABOUT 4% DECLINE IN THE PROJECT THE POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE HERE YEAH- AND SO THE LEAST THAT DISCREPANCY I THINK WE NEED TO BE EXPLAINED TO US- MAYBE THERE'S VALIDITY TO. TO OF NUMBERS I AND THEN I WOULD GO BACK TO THE SEPARATION IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THE MOMENT RIGHT NOW BUT WE'RE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE IN THIS MOMENT AND WE WANT TO BE PLANNING LONG TERM AS WELL. FOR THOSE QUESTIONS MR STONE. WE HAVE SOMEONE ELSE SOMEONE SPEAK. MISTER JONES SAWYER. BUT IT THANK YOU SECRETARY ALISON- A. N. THE OTHER TYPICAL ABOUT THE ADDRESSED AND I THINK WE REALLY DO NEED SOME CLARIFICATION ON AND I'M JUST ECHOING WHAT MIGHT TO COLLEAGUE SAID IF SAID EARLIER OPTIMA MY FIRST CONCERN I JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS MY FIRST CONCERN IS. YES WE'VE RELEASED. INDIVIDUALS OUT AND I GUESS THERE'S A 20% DECREASE IN THE NUMBER RECENT ABOUT-COMMUNITY SUPERVISION NON NON NON EARLY RELEASE HIGH RISK MEDICAL REVIEW RELEASED COURT REFER ORIGINALLY SET UP PROP FIFTY SEVEN EARLY RELEASE CREDITS. AND REDUCTION OF INMATES COMING IN FROM THE COUNTY JAILS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED- AS WHY WE REDUCE OUR OUR POPULATION. WHEN IT COMES TO COMMUNITY SERVICE SUPERVISION AND OTHER PROGRAMS YOU MENTION SOME OF PAROLE I DO WE EVER DO. ANY ASSESSMENT OF HOW BECTIVE AND PATIENT THESE PROGRAMS ARE WHETHER THEY'RE NCDC ARE. ARE OUT. IN TWO NONPROFITS AND INTO THE COMMUNITY DO WE DO HAVE A SENSE OF HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE OR WE KIND OF A- A WIDGET SEN. BUT WE REALLY DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS SHOULD WHICH IS COMING OUT WE JUST WE JUST PLUGGING PEOPLE INTO PROGRAMS AND WE NEVER REALLY DETERMINE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. AND EFFICIENCY. THANK YOU I- WE DO HAVE SOME OF THE RESEARCH BEING CONDUCTED ON OUR PROGRAMS WE ASK FOR ALL OVER PROGRAM PROVIDERS TO BE EVIDENCE BASED BASED ON THE QUEUE- CRITERIA FOR. EVALUATING PROGRAMS SO THERE IS A VALUATION WE ALSO CONTINUE WITH OUR RECIDIVISM REVIEWS. OF OUR OVERALL RECIDIVISM I HAVE ASKED IN PARTICULAR TO HAVE DATA. AS IT RELATES TO THIS- ARE. LET'S CALL HAVEN'T ARE SEE HOW EFFORTS ARE TO BE ABLE TO TRY THOSE OFFENDERS TO SEE IF WE ACTUALLY DID PROVE THAT THAT. SOFT LANDING SPOT OF BREAKING DOWN ALL THOSE BARRIERS SINCE BEEN HELPFUL ONE OF THE CRITERIA CHANGES THAT WE MADE IN THAT PROGRAM IS OFTENTIMES OFFENDERS FEEL LIKE THEY CAN GO HOME TO THEIR GRANDMA'S HOUSE OUR MOM'S HOUSE- AND UNFORTUNATELY TWO WEEKS LATER THEY- THAT SITUATION IS CHANGING THEY HAVE THEY NO LONGER HAVE HOUSING OPTIONS. SO THIS PROGRAM IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH THAT ALL IT IS HEY IT'S A PHONE CALL TO THE PAROLE AGENT HEY I NEED A PLACE TO GO AND WE'RE ABLE TO HOUSE THEM- VERY RAPIDLY. AND SO I WE DO HAVE OUR- AN EMPLOYEE FROM DR HAVE A ON THE PHONE COULD MAYBE STILL MORE SO. ABOUT SOME OF THE RESEARCH- OPPORTUNITIES. SO I ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES LET ME DO IT THIS WAY MAYBE AND GET BACK UP TO. HER QUESTIONS AND THE REASON THAT LAST WAS SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE- THE CHAIR ASSEMBLY BUDGET IS REALLY REALLY HARD WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING NEW PROGRAMS IF YOU CAN PROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR PROGRAMS- YOU CAN YOU CAN REALLY DO WELL WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUDGET AND HOW WE PROGRAM FUNDING AND SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO GET INVOLVED IN THAT. AND THEN. ARE WE GETTING PREPARED YOU THIS IS PROBABLY A GLOBAL QUESTION. ARE WE GETTIN PREPARED FOR VACCINATION. THAT IS THE NEXT TRUMP STEROID YES WE'RE DOING. ALL WE CAN TO IDENTIFY AND WE HAVE DONE. THAT GOOD JOB FROM WHAT I CAN SEE BUT EVENTUALLY. EVENTUALLY VERY SOON WE SHOULD HAVE VACCINATIONS AND IS CDC ARE READY FOR THAT YOU CAN ANSWER THAT LATER. AND THEN YOU MENTIONED VIDEO VISUALIZATION COMPUTER SYSTEM. WHAT ABOUT CAMMISH. ARE YOU PUT YOU PUT ANY MONEY IN THE BUDGET SO THAT EVERY PERSON CDCR- HAS SOME TYPE OF CAMERA SO WE CAN SEE FINALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. IN OUR PRISONS AND WE CAN MAKE EFFECTIVE DECISIONS ON WHAT CAN AND CAN'T BE DONE. AND THE VEXING QUESTION AS PART OF ISSUE TO SOME AND A HALF OF THE HOLD UP ON THAT- DO YOU WANT TO. RESPOND ABOUT THE CAMERAS AND THEY WILL WANT TO MISTER LACKING. ABSOLUTELY AS- AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS WE'VE COME BACK AND FORTH OVER THE YEARS REQUESTING DIFFERENT- REQUEST FOR CAMERAS THERE IS. AN R. ARMSTRONG ORDER THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL REQUEST FOR CAMERAS. CURRENTLY WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A PILOT F. R. G. D. WHICH IS AN OPERATING RICHARD J. DONAHUE- INSTITUTION SAID THE ECHO. OF WE'VE IMPLEMENTED BODY CAMERAS AND WE PLAN TO HAVE A FULL INSTALLATION OF FIXED CAMERAS IN APRIL. WE CERTAINLY WELCOME CAMERA BUT THEY'RE QUITE COSTLY CAMERAS CAMERAS ARE ABOUT ONE POINT SIX MILLION ON AVERAGE AND OUR- FIXED CAMERA SYSTEMS ARE. A SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PER INSTITUTION UNDERSTAND OUR INSTITUTIONS. IN SIZE- AND SO THAT REALLY THE STUFF OF THE FOOTPRINT TO- AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF STAFF. JEFF CHASE THE COSTING OF CAMERAS COULD YOU. COULD YOU GET ME GET THIS COMMITTEE. THAT QUOTE US I THINK I COULD GET A BETTER QUOTE BUT THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE PLUS. IT'S JUST IMPORTANT THAT. THE LIFE AND SAFETY OF INMATES SHOULD NOT BE BASED ON HOW MUCH IT COSTS WE SHOULD WE SHOULD LOOK ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT. BUT WE WILL MAKE NOTED THAT HE GET THAT INFORMATION TO US IN THE FUTURE IN THE MEANTIME I'M GOING TO MOVE ON TO WHAT THE VICE CHAIR. THE COMMITTEE MR LACKEY LEFT THE COUPLE QUESTIONS AS WELL. YEAH MY QUESTION IS ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE HAS TO DO WITH THE- THE WORKERS COMP. COSTS AS THEY RELATE TO- CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS I IF I'M CORRECT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. APPROXIMATELY IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. FOR WORKERS COMP RELATED TO THIS CALL WITH THE SITUATION- I AM I CORRECT ON THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS AN EFFORT SPONSORED AGAIN DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES WE DO HAVE A PROPOSAL IN THE- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT'S ATTACHED TO. I THINK IT'S AB ELEVEN FIFTY NINE WHICH WAS A BILL THAT PASSED ON. LAST YEAR THEY CHANGES THE PRESUMPTION FOR. ATTACHED TO PUT. IN THE WORK PLACE- THIS ONE WHAT AND WHERE WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THERE IS A- GREAT DEAL OF UNKNOWN BECAUSE WE'RE KIND OF- IS YOU KNOW WE'RE KIND OF GOING THROUGH COMING IN REAL TIME. LEAVING SOME CUSTOMERS BASED ON. WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED SO FAR BUT- PART OF THE PROPOSAL IS THAT. IF OUR COSTS COME INTO HARD IF OUR GUESS IS WRONG. THEN WE HOW THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW US. TO TO. USE THE FUNDING THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE PROPOSAL WOULDN'T GO BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND. BUT WITH DEDICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE- BUT BASS HAS BEEN WE'VE EXPERIENCED- SOMETIMES YOU KNOW OUR EMPLOYEES ARE THE FRONT LINE AND THEY ARE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO. TO COPE IT IS REQUIRED EXPERIENCED WE DO EXPECT TO INCUR SOME. SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN THE COMING YEARS. HI ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS DECLARE THEIR SPEED ONE DOLLAR. AND INCLUDED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THEY IS NINE NINE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND ARE SOME VARYING AMOUNTS IN THE OUT YEARS. AND IT'S NOT ONGOING FUNDING IT IS YEAH IT EXTENDS THREE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND BUT IT IS IN RECOGNITION OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LEGISLATION. OKAY AND JUST PROGRESS I THINK OF SENATE BILL ELEVEN FIFTY NINE BUT YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFO. THANK YOU AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HEARING ON MARCH FIRST WHERE WE WILL BE. LOOKING AT ISSUES OF CAMERAS AND WORKERS COMP SO. MAYBE BY THEN- YOU CAN GET SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SO WE CAN BE A LITTLE LESS UNKNOWN. CATEGORY IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY AT WILL HAVE MISTER CHANG CLOSE THE FACT THAT THIS PANEL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THIS IS WITH. GREAT TO THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL FIRST. THE KICK OFF FOR YOUR TENURE- OF MADAM SECRETARY WHILE. PUSHING YOUR YOUR PRESENCE TODAY AND JUST HAD A JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR. THE SECRETARY LAW DEPARTMENT FINANCE I JUST GOING BACK TO- ON. MISTER STONES LINE OF QUESTIONING. WE SEE THAT EVEN. AS THE- YOU KNOW WE WERE LOSING. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED POSITIONS AND- WE'RE LOSING TWENTY. SEVEN THOUSAND INMATES. THE BUDGET HAS BARELY GONE DOWN SO- BASED ON YOUR PROJECTIONS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO START SEEING. ON SORT OF MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES. IN THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET. EVEN. THIRTEEN THIS IS ERIC SWANSON DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FISCAL SERVICES BOB HEARD OF THE I THINK THERE ARE- I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION KIND OF IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS THE FIRST TURN. WAY IS THE TIME. OUR LONG TERM REDUCTION PLAN FOR CDC ARE RELATED TO POPULATION WAS TO CUT- CONTRACT BASED FACILITY ARE YOU SOME CONTRACTORS FACILITIES FIRST. WE ARE STARTING NOW TO GET INTO IS YOU KNOW THIS LAST BUDGET HAS US CLOSING DVI AND THEN WHAT IS STILL PRESENT IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE OF THE POSITION REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- WILL START- WILL START GETTING HIGHER- BUT THAT WAS PART OF OUR REGIONAL APPROACH TO- GETTING US LESS RELIANT ON OUR- OUT OF STATE PRISONS IN ALABAMA AND OTHER PLACES. AND- SO THAT WE CAN CUT THOSE FIRST I THINK THE SECOND THING. THAT WE SHOULD MENTION IS THAT- OPEN ITSELF IS A FAST MOVING SO. WE DID NOT. PREDICT BE PART DECREASED WE EXPERIENCED NOW. AND- IT CORRECT HERE WHILE REDUCING THE PAST YEAR LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AXLE. EVENTUALLY I THINK AS WE GET MORE DATA WE WILL BE ABLE TO- FEDERAL LINE- THOSE TWO CATEGORIES OF DATA. IN ADDITION TO THAT- I WILL SAY THAT DUE TO CALL THAT A SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE TO SPREAD OUT OUR BLUEPRINT WHAT WE COULD TO CONSOLIDATE HOUSING UNITS THAT WE WOULD TYPICALLY BE ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE- WHEN OUR POPULATION IS LOWER. BUT DUE TO COLD AND WE HAD A DARK SPECIALLY ARE OPEN DORMS WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN SIX OF THE DISTANCE AND SO WORRIED WE HAVE A LARGER PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT. AND YOU DON'T START SEEING SAVINGS UNTIL YOU'RE ABLE TO REDUCE THE STAFFING. CHECK FOR WE CAN GET LET'S SAY- SO IT'S ALSO COMPLICATING FACTOR. SO I THINK WE'RE CLOSE IT IS OVER I THINK YOU'LL YOU'LL START SEEING SOME. SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS THAT THAT EVERYBODY IS ANXIOUS TO SEE BUT. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT WE STILL HAVE. YOU KNOW NEARLY ALLOW THOUSAND IN THE ACCOUNT JAILS HAVE TO IN AND WE HAVE TO PAY THOSE X. TO COUNT- INS IN THANK YOU FOR HOUSING IN OUR OFFENDERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU KNOW OF WILL BE UNDERSTOOD- SO I GUESS THE GOING YOUR YOUR POINT SO WHEN COLD FOOD IS NOT GOOD FOR THE ME JUST REPHRASE THE QUESTION SO WHEN IT'S COLD IT IS OVER. WHAT TYPE OF DROP IN EXPENDITURE WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE. HI ALEX CAN DO IT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS THE FIRST IS. ON THE BUDGET DOES REFLECT SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSURE OF DVI. I MEAN THAT'S NINETY FOUR C. NINETY FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION I'M IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND ONE TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT THAT IS REALLY WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF VERY DIRECT THE BEAMS COME BECAUSE THE CLOSER CLICKS YOU BE CLOSURE OF THE PRISON IS REALLY IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR DECLINING PRISON POPULATION. AND THEN THERE WILL BE OTHER ADJUSTMENTS THAT HAPPENED ON THE NATURAL DETERRENTS THAT ARE EXCUSE ME TIED TO YOU DIRECTLY TO THE POPULATION IN CITIES YOU ARE SO THOSE WOULD. COME ON THE NATURAL BUT I THINK WHAT WE WOULD SAY IN THE NEAR TERM IS IT'S NOT THAT. I'M AND A LOT OF WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN TERMS OF THAT THAT POPULATION SAVINGS OR SAVINGS THAT'S- RESULTING FROM THE REDUCTION IN POPULATIONS IS CAPTURED IN THE PRISON CLOSURES. AND WE WOULD ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO CLOSE AN ADDITIONAL AND PRISON WHICH WOULD COME FORWARD IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND SO THAT WOULD AGAIN KIND OF. TIME I'M CREATE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE REALIZED OVER THAT TIME I THINK. THIS IS A WOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL. AND SO IS IT FAIR TO ASSUME THAT WHEN THAT SECOND FACILITY IS ANNOUNCED AND- SET FOR CLOSURE WILL GET APPROXIMATELY ABOUT THE SAME. AMOUNT OF COST SAVINGS ROUGHLY. IDON'T KNOW IF THAT'S- I MEAN CERTAINLY BY OF THE ON. THAT'S BUT I THINK THAT'S GOING TO. ON A NUMBER OF. OPEN QUESTIONS THIS TIME. NOTHING I CAN SHARE. CERTAINLY THAT IN FOR. WOULD BE A- IN THE- TO. FORWARD WHY IS IT WHEN. EVEN PLAN ANNOUNCED THE NEXT. I'M NOT ABLE TO SHARE IT THIS TIME CERTAINLY HAPPY TED TIP- FOLLOW UP I KNOW THAT I. DID YEAH. ANNOUNCEMENT IS TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THAT WOULD WOULD THAT WOULD BE WHEN WE BRING THE PROPOSAL FORWARD. I'M NOT ABLE TO HEAR ANYTHING AS TO TIMING. THE TRUST GO BACK TO THE CONTRACT BASED FACILITIES THE- THE PARTY WAS TALKING ABOUT I JUST WANNA CLARIFY. I KNOW WE WERE VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF CLOSING OUT- CONTRACTS HOWEVER I THINK THERE WERE. SOME CONTRACT THE FACILITIES THAT WE THOUGHT IT MADE SENSE TO CONTINUE. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE IN SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SHAPE. THAN THAN MANY OF OUR FACILITIES AND SO WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF DEFERRED. MAINTENANCE FOR THOSE FACILITIES AS WE DO FOR. OTHER FACILITIES INACTION FROM START TO THE CONTRACT WITH WHICH WE HAVE NO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BECAUSE WE DON'T PAY FOR THAT. SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD JUST BE I THINK AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION I WOULD MAKE FOR. A DEPARTMENT FROM OUR FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW HOW IT MIGHT BE JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. I'M I DID WANT ASK THE DEPARTMENT WHETHER YOU AGREED WITH THE L. A. AS ASSESSMENT THAT. ON TOP OF- THE SECOND FACILITY CLOSING THAT WITH THE L. A. O. PROJECTED THAT WE COULD BE CLOSING UP TO FIVE OF TOTAL FACILITIES AND- WE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT PROJECTION. HE WELL FIRST LET ME ADDRESS YOUR FIRST QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO- SO WE HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FACILITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE WE DO CONTRACT WITH CALIFORNIA CITY AND OUR CURRENT PROPOSALS JUST TO KEEP CALIFORNIA CITY HAS A CONTRACT CONTRACTED FACILITY WE TOTALLY STAFF BUT WITH OUR STAFF BUT YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THE PHYSICAL PLANT IS MAINTAINED BY THE CONTRACTOR THE FACILITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLOSING OR COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES THAT ARE- VERY SMALL FOOTPRINTS LOWER LEVEL OFFENDERS- SO WE'RE LIMITED ON WHAT WE ARE WHO WE CAN HOUSE THERE. AND THEY GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE- A HIGHER LEVEL SECURE PERIMETER SO IT DOES LIMIT US ON WHO CAN HOUSE THERE THE CURRENT ONE THAT IS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE IN MAY AS OUR LAST- FEMALE OFFENDER PROGRAM WHICH IS A MCFARLANE CALIFORNIA- AND SO THAT'S THE LAST. ONE THAT IS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE. AND NOW I'VE LOST MY BY JENNIFER AS TO GET RESERVE QUESTION WAS JUST REGARDING WERE YOU AGREE WITH L. A. ELSESSER THAT POTENTIALLY UP TO FIVE FACILITIES COULD BE CLOSED IN THE FUTURE. IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WELL OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS AND COBIZ TAUGHT US A LOT AS IT RELATES TO PHYSICAL PLANT OF OUR FACILITIES. AND HOW WE HOUSE- OFFENDERS- I WILL SAY NOBODY. KNEW AS FAR AS THAT OPEN CELL. CELL PHONES AS WELL AS YOUR SETTINGS. ON HOW RAMPANT IT WOULD GROW WITHIN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS SELECTED ITEMS SECRETARY GIVE AN ANSWER FOR MY QUESTION PLEASE. HONESTLY I THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO MAKE AN ESTIMATE OF FIVE INSTRUCTORS I DID WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE THE TRAILER BILLS THAT WE ARMY- THE GOVERNOR SIGNED LAST YEAR AND INTO LAW WHICH WAS. AROUND ASKING DEPARTMENT TO DO- CAPITAL PLANNING AND THE REASON I ASK FIVE FACILITIES IT IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WITH DVR ONE OF THE CONCERNS THE LEGISLATURE HAD IS COMING TRUE HELLO WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF CLOSING A PRISON WERE CLOSING DVI AT A TIME AFTER. WE HEARD THE RECEIVERS INSTRUCTION PUT IN A BRAND NEW- HICK HICK THERE BY FORGOT THAT WHAT STANDS FOR BUT HEALTH CARE FACILITY WHICH I THINK APPROXIMATE COST US THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SO BASICALLY WE PUT IN A BRAND NEW CARE FACILITY I GOT I GOT COLLEGE SHAKING THEIR HEAD I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT. ON THERE AND- AND THAT ON. THIS IS THIS IS A YOU KNOW VERY. SIGNIFICANTLY SO WE WERE TOLD BY YOUR STAFF THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE- FOLLOWING THE LAW AND WHAT WAS REQUIRED IN THE TRIPLE BY IGNORING US ARE. THOSE ARE NATURAL OKAY. OUR SYSTEM RIGHT BUT- BUT THAT THEY WERE JUST GONNA BE IGNORING- THAT PART OF THE BUDGET AGREEMENT SO COULD YOU CLARIFY AND MAYBE ELIMINATE TO US WHY THE STAFF IS DECIDING TO- NOT GIVE US THIS VERY CRITICAL INFORMATION SO THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO. THROW AWAY THE PUBLIC'S MONEY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK- I KNOW YOU HAVE THE NEXT HEARING WE HAVE IS- DEDICATED TO CAPITAL OUTLAY AND I THINK ONE OF THE TOPICS IT'S GOING TO COME OUT THIS- PESAR EL OR SUPPLEMENTARY. LANGUAGE THAT I THINK YOU'RE- YOU'RE MENTIONING- REGARDING EXPERIMENTATION OF PROJECTS- WE WILL JUST SAY THAT. FROM COOKING UP FROM THE SECRETARY SHE'S CHOOSING CHARGE. WELL I WILL SAY THAT- WE'RE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE OUR FACILITIES MANAGEMENT ADDRESSED THAT VERY SPECIFIC CONCERN YOU KNOW DECISIONS ARE MADE I DON'T THINK ANY OF US IN NEW WHEN SOME OF THESE DECISIONS WERE MADE THAT OUR POPULATION WOULD REDUCE AS DRASTICALLY AS IT DID NOBODY FOR SAME COVERAGE AND THAT DRASTIC REDUCTIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN WE DO HAVE TO MAINTAIN OUR FACILITIES FOR THOSE WHO LIVE THERE- AS LONG AS THEY LIVE THERE I CANNOT HAVE LEAKY ROOFS OVER OFFENDERS HOUSING UNITS. AND WE HAVE ON ALL WE DON'T WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE ARE JUST ASKING FOR A PLAN OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SO THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO WASTE THE PUBLIC'S MONEY. PUTTING IN MONEY FOR TO. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR FACILITIES WHICH WE ARE GOING TO CLOSE. WHAT AND WHAT I WOULD SAY WE DO HAVE A HEARING ON THIS AS AN EXPERIENCE I WOULD I WOULD URGE THE SECRETARY TO HEAR THE MEMBERS FRUSTRATIONS AND QUESTIONS THE ONE ASK YOU THEN COME PREPARED- TO. TO GIVE US SOME BETTER ANSWERS AT THE NEXT HEARING ON THIS TOPIC THAT'S- THAT'S THE FIVE. IT ADOPTABLE REQUESTING A MEETING WITH YOUR FACILITIES- THE PROPER FACILITIES PERSON HAVE A DISCUSSION. ON THAT DIRECTLY. SO I WILL MAKE THANKS TO COMMENTS AND THEN I DO HAVE TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL JUST TRYING TO MINDFUL OF TIME- THE CLOSING OF THAT PERSON WITH PLAN BEFORE COVE IT. ON AND SO WE CAN'T PUT- WE CAN'T PUT THE BLAME ON COVER FOR WHERE WE SPENT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ON A HEALTH CLINIC IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE PRISON DOWN ON AS I THINK WE NEED A BETTER ANSWER COME NEXT HEARING- IN ADDITION TO THAT- EVEN WITH THE DROP IN POPULATION. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOR EXPECTING A PLANE COMPENSATION TO ALL BY TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO AND SO WE DO HAVE SOME PLANNING THAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE YOU SEEN OUR TAX DOLLARS AS WISELY AS POSSIBLE MOVING FORWARD AND SO- I APPRECIATE THE SECRETARY'S TIME. I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN HERE A. LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN I'VE BEEN HERE BUT NOT MUCH LONGER- BUT THE- THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR YEARS AND- A LOT OF HIS FRUSTRATIONS ARE ONGOING- BEFORE BECAUSE OF IT AND WE HOPE THAT. WITH YOUR- TENURE WE COULD TURN THINGS AROUND AND HAVE. A BETTER RELATIONSHIP- AND A BETTER PROCESS THE PLANNING. FOR CLOSER CENTER BUDGET DOLLARS. SOME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE US TOWARDS SECOND PANEL. FOR A SECOND PANEL WE HAVE THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHO WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF PART THE OTHER COVERT NINETEEN. REVIEW OF THE STATE PRESENTS. THE RECEIVER'S OFFICE WILL PROVIDE A STATUS UPDATE ON CDC OURS ONGOING MITIGATION EFFORTS. WE HAVE TO THE PANELISTS WITH THIS DAY WE HAVE ROY WESLEY OUR INSPECTOR GENERAL. CLARK KELSO ARE FEDERAL RECEIVER AND CDCR STAFF WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE. AND SO I WILL- WE WILL HAVE TO BEGIN EMPANELING OFF THE PANEL PANELIST TO PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF BEFORE YOU SPEAK. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. I'M ROY WESLEY. THE CALIFORNIA ALL OF INSPECTOR GENERAL. I WILL ADDRESS THE THREE REPORTS MY AGENCY COMPLETED AT THE REQUEST OF THE HONORABLE ANTHONY RENDON SPEAKER THE ASSEMBLY. IN ANSWER TO HIS REQUEST WE BROKE THE PROJECT INTO THREE BROAD PIECES. THE FIRST WAS A REVIEW ON HOW THE DEPARTMENT SCREEN STAFF AND VISITORS WHO ENTERED THE PERSON'S. WE PUBLISHED A REPORT ON THE SCREENING PROCESS ON AUGUST EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AND WE FOUND THAT THE SCREENINGS WERE NOT CONSISTENT OR STANDARDIZED ACROSS THE SYSTEM. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT HAS SINCE BEEN REMEDIED. THE SECOND PART WAS THE USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WITHIN THE PRISONS AND INCLUDED COMPLIANCE WITH MASS WEARING PROTOCOLS. THAT PUT THAT REPORT WAS PUBLISHED ON OCTOBER TWENTY SIX TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AND WE FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH THE DEPARTMENT MANDATED TO WEAR A FACEMASK. ENFORCEMENT OF ITS MANDATE WAS LACKS. OUR FINAL REPORT ISSUED ON FEBRUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE ADDRESSED THE TREATMENT OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE. WHO WERE SUSPECTED TO HAVE CONTRACTED CODE NINETEEN OR WORK SUPPOSED TO COVER NINETEEN. WITH A FOCUS ON THE MOVE A MEDICALLY VULNERABLE INCARCERATED PERSONS. FROM THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR MEN TO SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON. AND CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON CORCORAN. THE LATEST REPORT ALSO INCLUDES AN ANIMATED TIMELINE DETAILING THE OUTBREAK OF THE VIRUS AT SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON. AND CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON CORCORAN. EACH OF OUR REPORTS CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE. TODAY I'LL PROVIDE A SHORT SUMMARY OF OUR LATEST REPORT. THE LATEST REPORT DETAILS THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE MAY TWENTY EIGHTH THROUGH MAY THIRTIETH MOVES OF MEDICALLY AFFORDABLE INCARCERATED PERSONS FROM THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR MEN. TO THE SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON CORCORAN. LET ME SAY AT THE OUTSET THAT THE DECISION TO MOVE THESE MEN. WAS WELL INTENTIONED AND REFLECTED A CONCERN ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THESE MEDICALLY FRAGILE PATIENTS. I BELIEVE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY. TO TRY TO PROTECT THESE INDIVIDUALS. UNFORTUNATELY THE EXECUTION OF THESE MOVES WAS DEEPLY FLAWED. REQUIREMENTS APPROVED BY THE RECEIVER JUST ONE WEEK PRIOR TO THE MOVES WERE NOT FOLLOWED BY DEPARTMENT STAFF. WHAT ALARMS RAISED BY MEDICAL STAFF THAT NO TESTING HAD RECENTLY BEEN DONE. THOSE CONCERNS OF MEDICAL STAFF WERE IGNORED BY THEIR MANAGERS. IN ADDITION LINE STAFFER UNDER A MISTAKEN IMPRESSION FOSTERED BY THOSE ABOVE THEM. THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THE VULNERABLE PATIENTS HAD TO HAPPEN BY A HARD DATE. CURSORY PERSONS WERE PUT ON BUSES. IN MOST CASES WITHOUT APPROPRIATE TESTING. WITHOUT APPROPRIATE SYMPTOMS SCREENING AND WITHOUT APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL DISTANCE. FOR THOSE ARRIVING AT SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON. ONCE THEY REACH THEIR DESTINATION THEY WERE NOT PLACED AN APPROPRIATE ISOLATION OR QUARANTINE. EVEN THOSE WHO WERE SYMPTOMATIC WHEN THEY REACH TANK WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY SEGREGATED. MULTIPLE CUSTODY STAFF REGULARLY WORK IN NUMEROUS AREAS OF THE PRISON. AND INITIALLY NO MODIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO CUSTODY STAFF ASSIGNMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT STAFF DID NOT CARRY INFECTION FROM ONE PART OF THE PRESENT TO OTHER PARTS OF THE PROJECT. IT IS LIKELY THAT CUTS THE STAFF ON WITTINGLY CARRIED THE VIRUS TO MULTIPLE PLACES WITHIN THE PRISON. FINALLY IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT ENOUGH THOUGHT WAS GIVEN TO WHETHER THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF SAN QUENTIN. WITH ITS OPEN SELF FRONT ARCHITECTURE MAYBE IT'S PRISON ON APPROPRIATE CANDIDATES TO RECEIVE THESE MEGA. THE FAILURE TO PROPERLY TEST AND SCREEN THE PEOPLE BEING TRANSFERRED INAPPROPRIATE HOUSING. AND LACK OF INTERNAL SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE STAFF WITHOUT VECTORS TO THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. LED TO AN OUTBREAK OF ENORMOUS PROPORTIONS. AT SAN QUENTIN. I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU AN ANIMATION OF THE TIME I MIND THAT WE DEVELOPED. OF THE OUTBREAK AT SAN QUENTIN. THANK YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THE PANEL PRESENTATIONS FOR THIS IS SHERRY BEFORE WE TAKE QUESTIONS SO WE COULD HAVE OUR SECOND SPEAKER. MADAM CHAIR GARCIA- AND- MY NAME'S CLARK ALSO AND I SORT OF THE FEDERAL RECEIVER RESPONSIBLE FOR MEDICAL CARE WITHIN CDCR. TODAY I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CALL WITH THE UPDATE. CCAR'S EXPERIENCES SIMILAR TO THE EXPERIENCE NATIONWIDE OF OTHER CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND CONGREGATE LIVING ENVIRONMENTS SUCH. AS SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THE ARE NOT SAFE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH TO BE HOW OR DO WORK DURING A HAND. WE FOLLOW THE DEVELOPING SCIENCE ON CLIMATE DALY AND WITH THE HELP OF OUR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. WE ARE IMPROVING OUR POLICIES PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES ON A CONSTANT BASIS. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE PRESIDENT'S AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE. WE ARE.

FOURTEEN THOUSAND HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MOTORISTS ALL AN EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE STILL. THERE ARE MANY TWENTY FIVE STAFF THIS. YES MA'AM. I AM VERY GOOD PIECES MOVEMENTS PERHAPS THE BEST MILLIONS IN A YEAR STRAWSON DIFFICULT. FIRST STARTED IT GOES OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR THE RISK TO CARPOOL WITH PATIENTS OF THE HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH. SEVENTEEN CREASED ABOUT 26% EVERY NINETY DAYS. THIS MEANS THAT SOMEONE TESTS POSITIVE FOR GOVERNMENT TODAY M. C. C. R. IS ABOUT 50% LESS LIKELY TO BE HOSPITALIZED OR DIED. ANY OF THAT SAME PERSON WORKING WITH DEFICIT POSITIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BAND. DON'T WORRY HAVE TOTALLY GOTTEN BETTER AND MONITORING CARING FOR AND TREATING ARTICLE WITH PATIENTS. SECONDLY EVEN BETTER NEWS IS THAT WE HAVE STARTED VACCINATING ANIMALS VULNERABLE PATIENTS ONES MOST LIKELY TO BE HOSPITALIZED FOR TONIGHT. I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THE FIRST ALLEGATION OF AXIOMS WAS RECEIVED ON DECEMBER TWENTY FIRST AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FACILITY IN STOCK. INITIALLY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOSES OF FIGHTER AND BUT THERE ARE NONE OR IN MEDIA DISTRIBUTION. TO HIGHEST RISK PATIENTS WHAT ARE THE EQUIVALENT OF NURSING HOMES THE FACILITIES.

I AM TO SEVEN POINT AN IMPORTANT. TO AND BEFORE WE TAKEN THE TIME ADEQUATELY PREPARE AND TRY ALL THE NEW MOVEMENT PROTOCOLS THAT HAD JUST BEEN INVOLVED. IN THE WEEK PRIOR TO THE MOON. THE MATERIALS REPORT AWAY. I THINK IT'S CONFIRM WHAT I SAW SIX MONTHS. AND I WON'T. THE ALLIED WORK. AND IT'S DETAIL. WE WERE TRYING TO MOVE QUICKLY WITH THE TWO BIG. YES ARE ONLY TO PAY OF IMPORT COMMENTS. MORE FULLY DISCUSS BUT I THINK THE O. R. G. REPORT. FIRST I THINK RECORD ALL DOWN. THE REASON FOR THE TRANSFER. IN THE BRONX LOSES OF THE LAW BIRD. DECISIONS THAT MADE DURING THE- GLOBAL SPRAY WITHIN SPEED I AM. AND WE FACED A SIR THAT IF WE NOT. ANOTHER THOUSAND RATHER AND CHAU WOULD ALLOW BE IN FACT. AND A NUMBER THOSE NOT. REDUCING THAT RISK WAS THE- URGENCY. AND NUMBER TWO IT IS. THROUGH THE ATTEMPTED MOVE. THERE WAS NO ARTIFICIAL URGENCY THERE WAS NO BUREAUCRATIC AND DEVIL SO WITH THE MOVE. AND WE MAY LOCAL BUT STILLTHE FEDERAL. THERE WAS URGENCY ALL BECAUSE OF TRAILER. AND SEE I AM. WE WERE MOVED QUICKLY. IN REFERENCE- GREAT. BECAUSE THE OF THE MOMENT WE FOUGHT FOR THAT TYPE OF BACK. THANK. IT MADE IT MADE. TWENTY IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WAS KNOWN ABOUT FM TIME. ALTHOUGH WE IS NOT CLEAR THAT DON'T SEE BE. AND HOW SUCH AS A AND- BECAUSE THE VIRUS BY AEROSOL SAFE SHARE ERRORS. PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES BACK IN MAY. BELIEVE CODES FOR BY. MARC SAUSAGE. THAT ALONG WITH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE ASSUME DROPPED ONLY TRANSFER. THE SPACE PARKING WHAT HAVE BEEN A PART PLACE FOR POOR. AND TO TEST THE PATIENCE OF FROM C. HIGH. SPACEBALL DON'T AT THE TIME WE THE SAMPLE WAS SAFER PLACE THAN I AM FOR THE SENATE. AS WE WERE. AND ULTIMATELY CONFIRM AS FOR DISEASE TO AND- IN OCT. OF LAST YEAR. GO FOR IT. MINOR RENTALS ARE. ABSOLUTELY THE SAN JOAQUIN TRADE. THE ONE REPORT ON I THINK CORRECT THAT ONE REASON DID NOT A SIMILAR UP CORPORATION IS QUARANTINE SPACE THERE WAS MORE. AT PREVENTING. ULTIMATELY WE LEARNED FROM THE SAMPLE NOW IT. THEN THERE'S THE I THE REPORT INDICATES WE SAW THE PROBLEM MADE A SINCE NUMBER OF IMPROVE. ALL SEASON PROCEDURE RELATED TO MANAGING OPERATE AND MOVING. SO THEY SAID QUITE UNTIDY FAILURE HAS NOT HAPPENED AGAIN. IMPOSING ONE REARRANGED THE WE HAVE LOOKING FOR TO IMPROVE. ON FOR WE KNOW WE CAN NEVER THE MOVEMENT AND STUFF THE LIST PARTNERS NO MATTER HOW HARD WE TRY. AS ONE DATASET. IT FRONT OF MYERS FOR DESIGNED IF I DEAL ALL. IT WOULD BUILD A PER. THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR OUR COMMITTEE MEETING THAT'S FINE WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER. I DON'T REMEMBER THE REST. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OR FIGHT A FINANCE OR ALEJO. MORROW THE L. A. O. NO FOR THE COMMENT. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I DON'T THINK HE WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU AND I HAVE. A SERIES OF QUESTIONS FROM THE ON GOING TO THAT THE FIRST ONE AND THEN. I'M GOING TO PASS THAT TO MR LACKEY TO ASK THIS QUESTION OF XTC HAD EARLIER. THANK YOU BOB MY QUESTION- I KNOW MISTER KELSO YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD A SIMILAR SEARCH IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PAD IN THE PUBLIC BUT THE PRESIDENT THERE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SYSTEM WE HAVE A CONTROL SPACE- WHERE WE HAVE STAFF THAT ARE SUPPOSE TO BE DOESN'T REGULARLY PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO VERY MATH WE HAVE WITH WILL BE SCREENING PEOPLE AND THEY ENTERED THE PRINCESS. KEEPING PEOPLE SEPARATED- AND SO FORTH I AND SO IT'S NOT THE SAME AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC OUT THERE TO VERY DIFFERENT CONTROLLED SPACE AND WHILE WE CAN'T COMPLETELY STOP THE SPREAD OF COVERAGE WE COULD DEFINITELY MITIGATE THE CASES OR HOW QUICKLY IT SPREADING INSIDE IN THE CAR ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OVER TIME. AND SO DO YOU NOW THAT YOU ARE SAYING YOU. YOU'RE LEARNING SOME LESSONS- AND WE CAN MAYBE ADMIT THAT THE POLICIES WERE NOT SUFFICIENT TO BEGIN WITH HOW ARE WE ENSURING THAT WE HAVE COMPLIANCE ACROSS ALL THIRTY FIVE STATE TO THAT- FOLKS ARE WEARING THEIR MATH WE ARE SOCIALLY DISTANCING WE ARE USING ALL THE BEST PRACTICES WE ARE ADHERING TO WHAT THE CDC IS RECOMMENDING OUT THERE NOWTEN MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD WITH LESSONS LEARNED. I'M SURE- I THINK IT TO ASPECTS OF YOUR QUESTION I THINK. ON THE FIRST IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANT TO TRY TO MAKE URE WE HAVE MASK WEARING. ON AND JUST INSANE RIDICULOUS BY STAFF WILL ALSO. BY INMATES. OF THE ANSWER THAT IS FOLLOWING ME ALL RIGHT REPORTER. STEPPED UP ENFORCEMENT. OF DISCIPLINE. INCLUDING I HEARD RECENTLY DISCIPLINE UP TO THE LEVEL OF WORK- WAS NOT. WEARING A MASK. FOR AND WE'RE LOOK THEM IMPROVE LEVEL. OF THE COURT- I HAVE THE OLD OF INSPECTOR GENERAL. IT WAS JUST YOU KNOW I'M- AND WILL. ON THOSE OF COMPLIANCE. SO I THINK OF STUFF ARE BEING TAKEN THE TO RECRUIT COMPLY. THIS PART OF THE- EVEN WITH A FULL- YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S SORT OF A CONTROLLED AND- BUT IS A CONTROLLING. WHERE YOU'VE GOT NINE. TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CLOSE. PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER. M. EVEN WITH COMPLIANCE THIS IS A HIGH SETTING. FOR AN INFECTION DISEASE QUICKLY AS WHY THIS IS BEEN A AROUND THE COUNTRY ON ALL JAIL. THIS IS A CENTRAL. IF YOU HAPPEN PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR IS. DEALING IN OUR. ALONG WITH CONTRACT. OVER THE LONG TO MAKE ITS WAY YOU. YEAH BEFORE CHRISTMAS NINE ONE POINT. FOR WHY WOULD YOU UP SEEING AND WHOLE. OF MALCOLM CORRECTIONS. IS THAT. WE INVITE. ACCESS AS A MAN. ANY THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY IT'S GOING TO BE GLORIFIED TIMES WORSE. IN THE CAR STILL AND MEDICARE. AND M. RUSSELL. WHAT THAT REALLY IS THE FACT. IS THAT MUCH MORE- SO IT KNOW THAT THINGS ARE GONNA BE WORSE- IN THESE FACILITIES I AM GONNA HAVE TO HAVE THE PUSH BACK ON HOW WE PLANNED THEN ACCORDINGLY AND HOW WE ENSURE THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS AND REDEEMED THE REPORT FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THERE WAS LACKS IMPLEMENTATION- ALL OVER THE pPLACE EVEN AS IT READ THE REPORT ABOUT ENFORCEMENT. OF STATUS OVER THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AT LEAST AS OF NOVEMBER A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT GOING ON A LOT OF LITTLE WHETHER IT'S VERBAL OR WRITTEN COUNSELING- WITH STAFF ABOUT SIMPLE THINGS LIKE MATH WEARING OUT THERE AND IF WE ARE GOING TO BE RELYING ON THE VACCINES HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT DO NOT WANT TO BE VACCINATED ARE WE MODIFYING THEIR WORK ASSIGNMENTS WHO LIMIT THEIR CONTACT. WITH PRISONERS AND OTHER STUFF. WELL THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- GENERALLY- SO FAR ALONG ON OUR- IN POPULATION- THE OFFICE TODAY. BY YEAH MAYES THEM EXTRA. HIGH FOR BANKS. ALMOST EVERY FOR. AND START STAMINA- WE RISK. NINETY ACCEPTANCE. RATES NOW WE HAVE EXPANDED DROPPED BEAT UP DOWN TO MORE HIGH 8285% PERHAPS TO TALK TO LOWER. FONG WHAT DO ABOUT SO THE BILL'S GOING WERE. EITHER A WEEK'S MANY OF OUR OF OUR INMATES SURVEYS THAT WE'VE DONE- ELIMINATED THEY JUST DON'T WANT. TO TAKE A FIRST. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS ELSE TAKES. SO WE CONSTANTLY GO BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN WERE. I YEAH WE ARE DISCOVERING THAT AS HAS THERE INCREASE TAKING A BACKSEAT. BARNSTEAD BILL THAT. IS CONTINUING TO BE A WORK AND- WE DO HAVE ON STAFF JUST AS IN THE FREE WORLD WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUSPICIOUS OF VACCINES. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO STILL DON'T BELIEVE. HELLO THE CODE IS THREE. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. ALL RIGHT WE'RE DOING THE SAME VITAMINS STAFFING TRYING TO GO BACK THE STAFF ON AS THEY SEE OTHER PEOPLE TAKING THE VACCINE AND WHEN ONE WAS LOOKING NOT HAVING BABIES SIDE EFFECTS. OVERSEEING AN INCREASING PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE SAY YES SO I HAVE BEEN OUR INITIAL APPROACHES WHILE WE'RE PUSHING OUT THE VACCINE PROGRAM. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN'T GET AS. MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I WANTED TO USE- UNDERTAKING- ANALYSIS ABOUT WHAT WE DO WHEN WE- THE OPEN AND- WE WON'T. PRESENT SO WHAT DO WE DO THAT TWENTY ARMENIANS ARE OF. AMISTAD BUT UNTIL IT CAME THROUGH THEM AND MAKE THE RIGHT. I'M NOT HERE TODAY TO SAY WHAT WE MIGHT END UP RECOMMEND IS IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM PROBLEM AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE BEST A GREAT QUESTION. SO THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT INFORMATION BUT I ACTUALLY. DON'T THINK YOU ANSWERED MY QUESTION- WHAT ARE WE DOING EVERY MODIFYING SCHEDULES VERY MODIFYING HOUSING IN THE MOMENT FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT DO NOT WANT TO BE VACCINATED BECAUSE THEN THE MOMENT. WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION AND PHIL I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GONNA COME BACK TO THEM A SECOND TIME IN A THIRD TIME. BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING IN THE MOMENT TO MODIFY. EXPOSURE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION CORRECTLY I THINK THE ANSWER IS WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING IN TERMS OF MODIFYING. HOUSING UNITS. IN THE LOWER ONE WE'RE STILL. TRYING SIMPLY TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE. HOUSE NOT THE TIME. TO START FOR EXAMPLE SAY WELL IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE GONNA MOVE. THE PRESIDENT THE US- PLEASE THOSE. FOR SO WE HAVE BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT WE ARE- TRY TO MAKE SURE THOSE BE WHO ARE NOT TAKE THE MAX. WE'RE WATCHING ESPECIALLY CAREFULLY ABOUT. ON IT ABOUT DISTANCE. AND THEIR WHEN I DON'T TERM. AS WE GET. OTHER REST OF THE MAXIMUM BROKE. WELL LOOK NO ARE GONNA BE RECOMMENDED ABOUT HOW. BUT WE'RE NOT MAKING A QUICK DECISION ABOUT MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE. FROM PEOPLE ACTUALLY WITH COLD IN THE PROP. AND WHAT ABOUT THE PATH OF THE TO BE BACK. YEAH EYES YEAH I DO WITH ME ON THIS THING DR JONES BIT WITH OUR TREATMENT OFFICE WOULD YOU LIKE PROVIDE A- FOR. THANKS FOR I'D GIVEN IF YOU NEED MORE. YEAH AND I WOULD LIKE AN EXPLANATION ALSO WITH STAFF WHO IS A VACCINATED I THINK NOT DOING ANYTHING IS HOW WE GOT INTO THIS PROBLEM ON AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO LEARN FROM PAST MISTAKES AND BE A LITTLE MORE PROACTIVE. TO PROTECT EVERYONE WHETHER IT'S OUR PRISONERS THEIR FAMILIES ARE OUR WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. UP UNTIL I'M SORRY. FOR DR. VISITS BENEFIT BECAUSE I JUST POSTED THE HIM BEFORE HE WAS PERHAPS. WHAT WOULD YOU QUESTION SO HE CAN ADDRESS IT PROPERLY. IF A STAFF MEMBER REFUSES TO GET VACCINATED WELL YOU MODIFY THEIR WORK ASSIGNMENTS TO LIMIT CONTACT WITH OTHERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT ALTHOUGH I'M NEVER HAPPY WITH THE PACE OF ANY OF OUR INITIATIVES ARE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS THIS WEEKEND IN JUST THE LAST FIVE MEETINGS. WE'VE MANAGED IT ACTS MAY HAVE OVERSTAFFED WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT GETTING SOME OF THE- WHEN YOU PUT THAT WITH THE FIFTEEN. ALREADY HAVE. WE WILL PASS THIRD OF OUR STAFF WRITER THAT'S NEEDED. OR HAVE SOME DEGREE OF IMMUNITY BECAUSE HAVING HAD. THIS IS JUST FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR SO. WE REMAIN VERY OPTIMISTIC. A LARGE NUMBER LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR STAY. GET ON BOARD ZACKS NATION WE HAD A VERY DETAILED ONLINE SURVEY AT THE BEGINNING THIS EFFORT. ABOUT HALF OF THE PEOPLE ONE OF THE VACCINE NOW IN ANOTHER REPORTER SAID. TO SEE MY BUDDY YOUR GOAL FIRST ARE MORE. SO VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET A HIGH TAXES OF ALONG BOTH OCCASIONS AND IMPORTANT. OKAY SO I JUST THAT READ THE IT THAT IS SOMEONE RIGHT REVIEW TO GIVE ACT AND- NOTHING IS BEING MODIFIED. THIS TIME THEIR JOB IS NOT BEING MODIFIED THEY ARE BEING REQUIRED TO WEAR FACE COVERINGS THAT ALL THE TIME AND USE APPROPRIATE FISCAL DISTANCING BUT THEY'RE NOT BEING PENALIZED AT THIS TIME OKAY JOB CHANGE OR NOT BEING FIRST IN LINE FOR THE NEXT THREE. OR WE COULD THINK ABOUT IT THAT WE'RE- NOT PRIOR EVERYONE'S HEALTH. OFTEN TRY TO BE A SERVICE BY- I'M GONNA HAVE WITH OUR VICE CHAIR- **** QUESTION. I NOTICED WENT WHEN YOU WERE A- SHOWING US THE CONCENTRATION OF THE SPREAD OF THE- OF THIS RECORD NINETEEN PROBLEM. I THINK IT WAS REFERRING ONLY TO THE INMATES I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS THE COMMENSURATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INMATES AND THOSE WHO ARE SERVING THEM. THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WHO ALSO CONTRACTED THAT MAY HAVE- ONGOING CONDITIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE IN A WORKMAN'S COMP COSTS. BECAUSE THOSE ARE ALL VERY SIGNIFICANT BUDGET CONCERNS THAT WE NEED TO PLAN FOR. WELL I THINK YOU'RE ASKING DID WE ANIMATE THE- SPREAD OF THE DISEASE VICE FOR STAFF AND THE ANSWER IS NO- THAT WAS- A LITTLE BIT HARDER. PROCESS OF THE WAY WE WERE ABLE TO ANIMATE THE- SPREAD OF THE DISEASE OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION WAS BY. PHYSICALLY MAPPING WHERE THEIR BEDS WERE- THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION FOR UP FOR STAFF WE JUST HAVE RAW NUMBERS. OKAY SO. JUST TO CLARIFY ON THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT. THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND THE STAFF THEY WERE DEALING WITH THE INMATES HAD VERY LITTLE SPREAD. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME. WELL CERTAINLY NOT AS ARE NOT AS DRAMATIC AS THE INCARCERATED POPULATION- THE NUMBERS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT- I'M LOOKING TO SEE IF I HAVE HERE. THE NUMBERS FOR THE- FOR THE STAFF INFECTIONS I DON'T THINK I HAVE THOSE- BUT IF WE COULD GET ALONG TO BE HIGHLY INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT WHAT THEY ARE JUST FOR SAFETY PURPOSES AND THOSE ARE ACTUALLY- RESPONSIBLE FOR CARING FOR THE INMATES I THINK THAT WE HAVE A STRONG DUTY TO- MAKE SURE THAT WE BUDGET. APPROPRIATELY SOUGHT THEIR COVERED FOR BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU A LOT OF THE HAVING BEEN A PERSON THAT'S- ADULT WITH THE VIRUS I HAVE ONGOING. HEALTH ISSUES. THAT THE THEY'RE NOT CHEAP. AND SO THESE ARE ALL VERY SIGNIFICANT COSTS THAT WE NEED TO BUDGET FOR AND THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO I'M NOT TRYING TO POINT FINGERS ANYBODY I JUST WANT. INFORMATION SO WE CAN PLAN ACCORDINGLY. WHAT WE WILL CERTAINLY GET THAT INFORMATION TO. MR DON'T FIRE. AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON. BUT IT APPEARS THE CDC ARE HAS ONCE AGAIN OPTED GATED THE ISSUE. A STATE SENATOR BRADFORD AND I BOTH WILL MAKE WITH THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION THE PREVIOUS SECRETARY A SECRETARY ALLISON THIS IS FOR YOU TO KNOW. THAT WE ASKED ABOUT THE SITUATION. WE WERE TOLD SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BENEFITS IN THIS REPORT. AND SO IF WE'RE HARD ON YOU. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF THIS COMMITTEE A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS HAS BEEN VERY VERY DIFFICULT. AND SO. WHEN I FIRST GOT ON THIS COMMITTEE. ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF CLARK KELSO AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE THE FEDERAL RECEIVER. I NOW UNDERSTAND FULLY WHY. UP FEDERAL RECEIVER HAS TO BE. INVOLVED IN CDCR WE ALREADY HAD THE REASON THEY'RE THERE BECAUSE PATIENTS INMATES DIED LEFT IN THE HALLWAY TO DIE. AND NOW WE'RE HERE WITH COATED WE'RE NOT ONLY INMATES ARE DYING. CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND STAFF ARE DYING AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE AND MOST IMPORTANT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY WENT BACK TO THE PRISONERS CAN'T GO BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY. SO OUR CONTRACT TRACING. EVEN ON OUR OWN EMPLOYEES WHICH SHOULD BE PARAMOUNT TO EVERYBODY. IS ABYSMAL AT BEST. AND SO. I THINK AND IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL RECEIVER THE INSPECTOR GENERAL MR WESLEY HAS DONE A SUPERB JOB AT TRACKING THIS AND THESE ARE TWO INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM THAT CAN GO INTO THE SYSTEM IN FACT WE PROBABLY SHOULD GIVE THEM MORE POWERS SO WE GET THIS INFORMATION TO US QUICKLY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IS IT IS A BIZARRE WHAT WE'RE GETTING RIGHT NOW. AND SO WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH NOT ONLY MAKING SURE WE CLEAN THIS MESS UP. THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN THAT WE PUT IN PLACE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK. I'M GONNA RECOGNIZED MR LEVINE WHO'S JOINING US HERE TODAY WHO REPRESENTS THE AREA THAT INCLUDES THANK LEFT SAN QUENTIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR FOR- FOR WELCOMING ME TO THE DAIS TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FEAR REPORT I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE ATTENTION THAT TELL YOU BROUGHT TO THIS- MY GRATITUDE ALSO EXTENDS THE SPEAKER- WHO REQUESTED THIS- THIS AS WELL- I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS FOR. A VERY LONG TIME AND- THEN I SEE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S AND COVERED- A VERY DISTURBING TRAIL- OF IT KNOWLEDGE MEANT OF- OF THE INADEQUATE PREPARATIONS THAT- THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS HAS SIDE HAD MADE. IN THE SPRING AND THE- THE- INABILITY FOR THE FEDERAL RECEIVERS OFFICE TO MAKE ANY COURSE CORRECTIONS- BUT INSTEAD POWERHEAD WITH VERY BAD DECISION MAKING AS EVIDENCED BY THE EMAILS- THAT WE SEE- AND ALSO THE KNOWLEDGE MEANT FROM THE RECEIVER HIMSELF. THE- THE EMAIL THAT I SEE ON ON THE FACT SHEET DATED WEDNESDAY MAY TWENTY SEVENTH- IT'S A PRETTY SERIOUS THIS PRETTY SERIOUS THEY THEY KNEW THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. AND WHEN I STARTED. REACHING OUT TO THE PARDON OF CORRECTIONS- ALTERNATELY HAVING A TELEPHONE CALL WITH WARDEN BROOMFIELD A DOCTOR. CHECK AND- UNDER SECRETARY REBAY I HAD ASKED ABOUT PLANS AND PREPARATIONS AT IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF A CONCERN- A VALID CONCERN BUT NOT LOOKING BACK THE BIGGEST CONCERN I SHOULD'VE HAD BUT BUT A CONCERN ABOUT. THE IMPACT ON HOSPITALS AND HOSPITALIZATION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OUR PRISONS ALL THIRTY FIVE FACILITIES- ARE FREQUENTLY IN PLACES WHERE THERE IS NOT. A GREAT DEAL OF CAPACITY FOR HOSPITALS. AND I'D I'D HADN'T CONSIDERED THE OTHER MISSTEPS THAT WOULD LEAD TO THIS PROBLEM- MY CONCERN WAS THAT THE DUAL THREAT OF BOTH THE COMMUNITY SPREAD AND SPREAD IN A PRISON OPERATE OF CODED BUT THE DATE. OF THIS EMAIL. OF WEDNESDAY MAY TWENTY SEVENTH IT'S A IT'S A REAL PROBLEM FOR ME BECAUSE IT WAS JUST A DAY BEFORE. THAT WE IN THE ASSEMBLY. ORGANIZED AS A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE. ON MAY TWENTY SIXTH TO TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET. AND WITH THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE STANDING UP THERE LIKE A STATUE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS RAISE CONCERNS THEY HAD ABOUT THE BUDGET. AND MY CONCERNS FOR WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN WITH AN APARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS FIELD MOST OF THE FIVE MINUTES I HAD THAT DAY. AND I I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHAT DID YOU DO. WITH ALL THE FEEDBACK YOU RECEIVED ON THE BUDGET THAT DAY. I WAS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THANK U. S. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU WITH SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I WAS NOT A PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU HAD. AND I THINK. IF YOUR QUESTION IS TO COVERT RESPONSE GENERALLY I'M DEPARTMENT FINANCES BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO. ASSIST FUNDING FOR THAT IN TERMS OF KIND OF OPERATIONAL NEEDS I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT. SO I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN KNOWING IS. WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES. PARTICIPATION IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE. PERFORMATIVE OR DID THE ADMINISTRATION PAY ATTENTION TO THE ISSUES THAT LAWMAKERS WERE RAISING THAT DAY. AND DO YOU HAVE EVIDENCE. THAT THERE WAS ANY RESPONSE TO THE ISSUES THAT THAT WERE RAISED. BECAUSE LOOKING AT THE EMAIL OF MAY TWENTY SEVENTH. OR THE EMAIL OF MAY TWENTY EIGHTH IT SEEMS LIKE NO ONE NO ONE HEARD THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD- THE AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT RAISE CONCERNS. ABOUT CORRECTIONS BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH IT IT NEVER LEFT. THE ASSEMBLY THAT DAY. WHEN THE DIRECTOR FINANCE WALKED OUT. I'M THANK YOU FOR THAT THE QUESTION WOULD JUST SAYING AGAIN AT I AM CERTAIN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TOOK ALL OF THE ASSEMBLY CONCERNS UNDER CONSIDERATION I'M WE PUT FORWARD A BUDGET THAT INCLUDED I'M RESOURCE HERE I AM INTERESTED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO COPE DID WE HAVE A BUDGET NOW AND ARE LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO FUND COVERT RESPONSE. I'M IN TERMS OF ANY SPECIFICS ABOUT CONVERSATION I WOULD HAVE TO IS FOLLOW UP WITH OUR LEADERSHIP AND GET BACK TO YOU BUT I THINK THIS ADMINISTRATION AS A WHOLE PARTICULARLY FOR CDC ARE ANYTHING. AND SO MOTHER RIGHT BIT APARTMENT CAN SPEAK TO A LITTLE BIT I'M BETTER THAN MYSELF AND SOME OF THOSE ARE YOU KNOW OPERATIONAL DECISIONS. INTERVENE HI. MAY QUICKLY BUT TERMS OF THE RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN PRIORITIZING RESOURCES FOR COPING. NOT JUST WITHIN CDCR BUT ACROSS THE STATE. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN AND LOOKING TO PARTNER WITH OUR- I FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEMATIC RIGHT AWAY AND I THINK. AS MANY RESOURCES AS POSSIBLE I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE. FOR I'M NOT SURE WHO CAN ANSWERED MY NEXT QUESTION I DON'T I DON'T. I WON'T. ASK YOU TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT YOU'RE IN A POSITION REALLY ADEQUATELY DEAL WITH AN INSPECTOR GENERAL MIGHT HAVE SOME INSIGHT. THE V- GRAPHIC THE ANIMATION THAT YOU PRESENTED- WITH SOMETHING THAT THAT MY COMMUNITY EXPERIENCED IN REAL TIME- CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE IN SAN QUENTIN EXPERIENCE IN REAL TIME. WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO TAKE THE DISASTER SERIOUSLY AT SAN QUENTIN I WAS CALLING. VERY EARLY FOR- YEAH AN OPERATIONAL COMMAND TO BE SET UP- FOR- AN ALTERNATE CARE SITES TO BE SET UP- FOR SPACING FOR THE INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO LIMIT SPREAD. NONE OF THIS TOOK PLACE UNTIL JULY WHEN- YES GOT INVOLVED WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG CAN ANYONE ANSWER THAT QUESTION. HELLO THIS IS ROY WESLEY- INSPECTOR GENERAL I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO- MR KELSO. OUR OUR REVIEW OF THE PROCESS REALLY DIDN'T GO INTO THE RESPONSE ONCE THE OUTBREAK HAPPENED- WE LOOK AT THE OF THE MOVEMENT OF THOSE INCARCERATED PEOPLE AND THEM THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT MOVEMENT. AND DID NOT LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING THE AUTOCRAT THE ABSENT CLINTON ONCE THAT HAPPENED WELL WE DID NOTED OUR REPORT THAT SAN QUENTIN APPEARED TO BE A LITTLE SLOW AND- ISOLATING AND TESTING- THE PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED AND THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAN QUENTIN AND CORCORAN. BUT ONCE THE OPERATE- I'D HAVE TO DEFER TO MISTER COUNCIL ON ON WHAT I'M FINE HOW THEY HANDLED THAT. MISTER YES WE WERE GOING TO BE HERE- THANK YOU MA'AM LET ME GO QUESTIONS I DON'T THINK YOU'RE AWARE. REALLY EARLY JUNE WHEN WE REALIZE WE HAVE THE BEGINNINGS OF AN OUTBREAK AT SAN QUENTIN WELL I HAD ASKED- OUR EXPERT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO AND BERKLEY- TWO. SEVEN ONE TWO A LOOK AT WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AS YOU KNOW. OF AB. OR BACK TO ME AND GEN- INDICATING WHAT THEY BELIEVE WAS GOING TO BE USED. WHITE PLEASE. OF FOR. IN A SERIES OF STEPS AND INCLUDING SOME OF THE ONES YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT NEEDED TO BE TAKEN. I THINK THE REASON THAT SO LONG AS BEST- CALLED AND I DIDN'T COME HERE. TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I THE LEADERSHIP OF SAN QUENTIN BOTH. AND SIMPLY NOT OVER WHILE. I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE WHOLE WIDE RECEIVER. THAT- WE JUST. WE ARE SLOWING US TO REACT. YEAH ULTIMATELY- THAT WAS RECOGNIZE IN THE- I THINK OF THE RIGHT THING BY BRINGING HIM THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICE INSTEAD THE YOUNG COMMAND CENTER. THANK GROUP QUICKLY WENT WORKING STRUCTURE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED FROM. WELL AS WE NEED TO HAVE A AND- GAMES COME. UNIT CENTRAL. AFRICAN I WOULD- NOT LONG AFTER- BUT NOT SO THAT EVERY INSTITUTION WHAT ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH- OUTWARDS IT ULTIMATELY SERVED AS WHITE WELL IN THE NOVEMBER DECEMBER OUTBREAKS WHICH BASICALLY WE HAVE OUTBREAKS THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE SYSTEM. WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE SPORT OF YOU MIGHT. I WAS GREATEST SYSTEM TOOLS. OKAY YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CALL SO IT SO YOU HAD MENTIONED EARLIER IN YOUR PRESENTATION. THE GOOD NEWS- AND YOU SAID THAT THAT THE VERY SAME PERSON TODAY WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO DIE THAN IN JULY. AND I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU. HOW YOU MODEL- THE INCARCERATED PEOPLE ON THE PATIENTS AND THEIR RISK. AND THEIR LIKELINESS TO DIE FROM COVE ED. PURSES THE REALITY THAT PERHAPS THE MOST FRAGILE MEDICALLY VULNERABLE INCARCERATED PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY BEEN BEEN KILLED BY CODE. I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION I'M BEING TURNED TO DR SHORTLY AFTER I GET A- A WHAT I THINK IS THE PROPER ANSWER. OUR QUALITY MANAGEMENT UNIT WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE ISSUE. THREE COMING UP ON. TABLE. TO- OKAY- THE RISK FOR BASED ON EVERY- IN MAINE'S AGE COMORBIDITIES AND SO ON SO WE ARE NOT HAVING CONGRESS FOR SUPPORT EACH. INMATE DRAMA SYSTEM. EARLY IT'S WELL WE HAVE CREW GETS HOSPITAL ON. IN THE WIDELY LOOK OF YEAH IF YOU BECOME ACROSS. AND WE AS A MATTER ALL OVER THOSE NINETY DAYS SO THAT CRIED. NOTHING HEREIN BASED. BOB WAS SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY MODEL. HERE IS HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD HOSPITALIZE AND LIKELY WOULD HAVE DIED. IF NOTHING CHANGED. I'VE BEEN ON A PLANE THAT DIRECTLY DR BILL- RIGHT ANY MISTAKES AREN'T MADE ON THAT ANSWER. I THINK THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT YOU CAN ALSO SAY THAT EVERY PATIENT IS ASSIGNED THIS CALL RIGOROUS SCORE YEAH EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PATIENTS ALLOCATED CORPORATE RESOURCES OR INCREASED RISK. FOR HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH. THANK 9% OF OUR- HOUSE PATIENTS SO THEY WERE A NUMBER OF STEPS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE. IMPORTANT TO PROTECT PATIENTS GOING FORWARD YEAH I HAD TO DO WITH WHERE PATIENTS WITH ELEVATED RISK SCORES COULD BE PROBLEMS. HE MOVED FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER WHAT TYPE OF MONITORING WOULD TAKE PLACE OF PATIENTS DURING OUR BREAK SO WE CAN RAPIDLY IDENTIFY THOSE THAT NEEDED A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE. THE TYPE OF TREATMENT WAS PROVIDED TO PATIENTS. WITH DISABILITIES PRIOR TO THEM HAVING TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL'S. ON TOP OF THAT THERE DO YOU SEE. IMPROVE IN COMMUNITY. IN TERMS OF HOW PATIENTS ARE TREATED WITH WRESTLING IMPLEMENTED OTHER TREATMENTS SUCH AS THE MONOCHROME ANTIBODY THERAPY IN AN ATTEMPT TO DECREASE PEOPLE'S SEVERITY OF ILLNESS. SO EVERY ONE OF THEM TWO HUNDRED PATIENTS DESPERATELY PATTERSON AND TRAGIC BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A PERSON ALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR OVERALL RISK POPULATION. IN OUR ALREADY SEEN WITH MORE EXTENSIVE VACCINATION. THE RISK OF PEOPLE BECOMING SEVERELY ILL AFTER GETTING FIRST DOSE. SEEMS TO BE INCREASING. THIS OF SOME OF OUR OUR- I THANK DR BECK. MMHM MR CALL SO HAD MENTIONED- THAT- THAT WHAT WE HAD KNOWN AND MISTER BECAUSE WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS AT THE LAST HEARING THAT AT THAT POINT IN TIME HE WAS AWARE THAT DROPLETS WERE A THREAT. HE WAS NOT. CONVINCE THE ASSOCIATION HAD BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY ACCEPTED AS THE THREAT- I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE USING COMMONSENSE KNEW BETTER. BUT GIVEN WHAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING HOW DID YOU MODEL SAN QUENTIN IS APPROPRIATE IN A TROPICAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE ARE NO CLOSED DOORS AND ALL THAT BUT DROPLETS LIKE THAT THAT. HOW DID YOU FIGURE THE DISTANCE THE YOU KNOW SELL SPACE HOW DID YOU PLAN THAT ONE OF THE THIRTY FIVE FACILITIES. FOR THE TRANS. REMEMBER THE QUESTION. LET'S BE CLEAR ALSO I DO NOT MAKE THESE DECISION BY MYSELF ALL. WILL NOT BE INVITED TO A PUBLIC ALL THE MEDICAL LEADERSHIP. YOU FOR RECOMMENDING RECOMMENDATIONS MADE TO ME. ALTHOUGH I ON THE ONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING THAT DECISION BUT THE THAT'S WHY IT STOPPED THE PROBABILITY FOR. SIX MONTHS AGO. BUT IT'S NOT JUST ME I'M RELYING UPON EXPERTS WHO ARE FOLLOWING THE FINAL PRETTY CLOSELY. IN PARTICULAR AFTER SAM POINTON- I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT THE C. I. M. ALL THE WERE ALREADY VULNERABLE. YOU FOR MEMBERS WHO HAVE MEDICAL NEEDS SERVICE. YEAH IT WAS OF THE VIEW FIRST THE TIME AT HIM YEAH- SO. SUFFICIENT QUALITY OF MEDICAL CARE AND ACCESS TO HOSPITAL CARE SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE ONLY APART FROM PROBABLY. THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO STILL HAVE MEDICAL NEEDS. IN TERMS OF ALL ONE MY STAFF ABOUT IT LONG LEVEL DROP SPREAD GONNA BE A PROBLEM. EIGHT THE SOLEMN BAYERN IS THE ONLY MAKES SENSE. WE'RE STILL OUTSIDE A HOUSE. THE DIFFERENCE. DROPPED ONCE WHEN. IS YOU. NUMBER PROBLEM SINCE FEET ACROSS THE- THE GROUND. SO LONG AS SAID IN A- YOU PROTECT. THAT'S THE MODEL SAW SEVEN ONE. HELLO I. T. EXAMINATION OF YOUR SHOW YOU SO UP TO THE MAXIMUM. BROWN IF I LOOK FOR. WELL WHEN I WAS HAVE PEOPLE WITH TEARS WHO BECAUSE OF THEIR ASIAN IT WAS NOW. I AM A PART IS STILL ON THE LINE OF SAN QUENTIN. AND AS THE WORLD FROM THE U. CAL INDICATED OF THE- WITH THOSE UNITS. OF THE BILL SEEN SINCE- FOR A ERROR- INSTEAD OF PROMOTED AS MAY. WHERE ARE EVER SOLVED SPREAD. MOST NO. THANK YOU AND SO YOU KNOW ALTERNATE. YOU DON'T YOU DIDN'T HAVE A MODEL FORCE. WHEN THE CHOICE WAS IN. AND IT WASN'T REALLY S. OF WHAT WOULD BE A PRO. AND YOU YOU TO MAKE IT. BASED RECOMMEND AND I. CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT A POSITION LIKE THAT WOULD BE. WHO RECOMMENDED SAN QUENTIN IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE. MY WHY IT'S ALMOST BLIND ON OTHERS. IN THE WITH THEM MEDICAL LEADERSHIP- WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN. OKAY AND- I DON'T THAT ANYBODY HAVE WITH MODELS IN AND OKAY HOW GREATER OUR BROTHER YOU'RE AN DR THERE IT WAS THERE PEOPLE AT CDC ARE ADVISING YOU ON ON WHAT AN APPROPRIATE LOCATION ONCE. BROWN'S YOU KNOW I KNOW I MEAN IT WOULD BE DR THERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERS- ON THE STAFF ABOUT. BUT A DECISION ABOUT WHERE TO MOVE. SURE BUT DATE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SOMEONE AT CDC ARE SAYING THIS IS THE THIS IS THE TYPE OF FACILITY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND WHERE THEIR CHOICES OF FACILITIES OR THERE WAS ONE PERSON AT CDC ARE SANE. THE ONE FACILITY. NO I DON'T THINK OF ANYBODY ELSE THE ECR WAS TELLING US WHICH FACILITY I DON'T WE HAVE IN A DIFFERENT BOX THERE- BURKE CORRECTION SERVICES. AT THE TIME WHAT WAS DALY CONSTANT CONTACT WITH C. C. R. AND B. ALBUMS AND CDCR. THERE WERE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- IS THIS APPROPRIATE. I WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED CDC ARE THEIR CUSTODY SIDE TO IT SO HAVE. A VIEW. FROM. A HEALTHCARE PERSPECTIVE. SO BY THE CHURCH BEEN A GRACIOUS WITH ME FIVE ONE LAST QUESTION YOU YOU. SAID THAT SAN QUENTON WAS THE PLACE TO GO THAT THAT THERE IS A PLAN A PLACE TO SEND PEOPLE AND DO TESTING BUT THERE WAS NO PLAN FOR TESTING. THE NIGHT THAT THEY ARRIVED WHERE THERE WERE WERE SYMPTOMATIC PASSENGERS ON THE BUS- THERE WAS NO CAPACITY TO TEST AT SAN QUENTIN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO COMMUNITY HOSPITALS TO GET THEIR TASKS. THERE THERE IS NOTHING THERE FOR THEM TO TEST AND NOTHING THERE FOR ADEQUATE- QUARANTINE. THE STILL SAY THAT YOU HAD A PLAN TO TEST WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT SOME POINT. BECAUSE I THINK I NEED TO DO BEFORE AND I THINK THE ORANGE ORDER REVEALS. THERE WERE CONVERSATIONS WITH SAM POINT. WHERE THEY KNEW THAT THEY SHOULD. HAVE TESTED AND WARRANTY. THE FACT THAT HAVE A LITTLE MORE SLOWLY THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. AND I DON'T KNOW A LITTLE MEAN THAT. FRANKLY THIS FRIEND I THINK THEY JUST WANT. THERE WERE TOO MANY CASES THEM ABOUT THE SAMPLE. IN NOVEMBER UP BEING A OUT OF PLACE. BOB HAVE ANY. OPEN CASES. THANKS PLAN WAS SIMPLY. USE THE FORM SPACE A LITTLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IF NO ONE ELSE WITH ANY OTHER. THANK YOU I WOULD JUST- WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO ISSUE THE IN IN A MINUTE BUT I WHICH IS. I RECOMMEND THAT WE HERE THE MEMBERS FRUSTRATIONS THAT THE STATUS QUO ISN'T WORKING. AND THAT WE EXPECT- THAT WE EXPECT THAT WE EXPECT THE CDC ARE TO CORRECT- THE PORES THEY'VE BEEN ON WE WANT TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE IF YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE- AND THE WORK YOU'RE DOING BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT WE'RE LACKING THAT I WHEN WE'RE GETTING ANSWERS LIKE. WE'RE NOT SURE WE NOTHING HAS CHANGED OUT THERE ARE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THINGS DO CHANGE BECAUSE IT COMES WITH LIABILITY TO OUR TAX DOLLARS JUST RECENTLY OF CALLOUS OR FIND THE FIND THE DEPARTMENT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR CODE VIOLATIONS AND THAT THEY'RE NOT THE FIRST. AND OUR TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THAT FOR THE VIOLATIONS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING ALL WE CAN TO AVOID THE VIOLATIONS THAT IS TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE BUT ALSO TO PROTECT THE TAX DOLLARS FOR ALL THE OTHER SERVICES THAT WE NEED OUT THERE.
