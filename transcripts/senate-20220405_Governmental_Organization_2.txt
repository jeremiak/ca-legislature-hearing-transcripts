I BELIEVE MR OF O'KELLY- TRIBAL NEGOTIATOR FOR THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM IS HERE IN THE CHAMBER MISTER MCNALLY PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BE YET. THE MORNING THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DON COMMITTEE MEMBERS. J. THE CHANCE THIS MORNING TO CRIED RIGHT INFORMATION ON THE CONTACT AMENDMENTS IN FRONT OF THE SENATE GEO COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NATHAN VOCALLY ON THE SENIOR ADVISER FOR TRAVEL NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE OFFICE. BEFORE WE START I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE TRIBES IN THEIR CHAIRPERSONS CHAIR MARKETS QUERO CAMPER VAN TO DIG WHEN YOU MISSION INDIANS JOSE SIMON THE THIRD FOR MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA CHADLI A CISCO FOR SANTA ROSA RANCHERIA AND CHAIR BRENDA LOVELL FOR TABLE MOUNTAIN RANCHERIA. THESE FOUR TRIBES ARE ALL CURRENTLY CONDUCTING CLASS THREE GAMING PURSUANT TO TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACT ORIGINALLY SIGNED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE ANDREFERRED TO AS NINETY NINE CONTACT. SB EIGHT NINETY EIGHT WOULD RATIFY AMENDMENTS EXTENDING THESE NINETY NINE CONTACTS FOR ONE YEAR TO JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I'LL GIVE A VERY BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE NINETY NINE CONTACTS TOUCH ON THE RASON FOR THE EXTENSIONS AND THEN WRAP UP WITH THE PROCESS FOR FINALIZING THOSE EXTENSIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND PROP ONE A. GRANTED TRIBES THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO OPERATE SLOT MACHINES AND BANKING IN PERCENTAGE CARD GAMES IN CALIFORNIA. PROP ANDONE A WAS CODIFIED IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE FOUR SECTION NINETEEN WHICH ALSO AUTHORIZES THE GOVERNOR TO NEGOTIATE. COMPAQ'S INCLUDING AMENDMENTS SUBJECT TO LEGISLATIVE RATIFICATION. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE TO TWO THOUSAND THE STATE ENTERED INTO OVER SIXTY TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACTS PURSUANT TO THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT. THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE CONTACTS WERE FOR AN INITIAL TWENTY YEAR TERM EXPIRING DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE CONTACTS ARE AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDED FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR TRYING THAT DID NOT YET HAVE A NEW CONTACT. THOSE NINETY NINETY NINE CONTACTS NOW EXPIRE BY THEIR OWN TERMS ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE NINETEEN NINETY NINE CONTACTS ALLOWED BUT DO NOT REQUIRE SURE I'VE IN THE STATE TO EXTEND THEIR TERM BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. MORE RECENTLY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE EIGHT TRIBES WITH NINETEEN NINETY NINE CONTACTS SIGNS NEW CONTACTS. THREE OF THESE CONTACTS INCLUDING THOSE FOR MIDDLETOWN RANCHERIA AND SANTA ROSA RANCHERIA WERE RATIFIED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SUBMITTED TO THE SECRETARY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR FOR REQUIRED FORTY FIVE DAY REVIEW. UNDER THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THESE EXTENSIONS IS THAT IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR INDIAN AFFAIRS. PURSUANT TO AUTHORITY DELEGATED FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR DISAPPROVE THREE OF THE GAMING COMPACTS. AS A RESULT OF THOSE CONTACT US APPROVALS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE STATE AND REMAINING NINETEEN NINETY NINE CONTACT CRIMES. WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A NEW COMPACT WITH SUFFICIENT CONFIDENCE THAT THE NEW CONTACTS WOULD TAKE EFFECT UNDER A GRAD. BEFORE TRIES NINETY NINE CONTACT EXPIRES ON JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. A ONE YEAR EXTENSION SHOULD AFFORD SUFFICIENT TIME TO HELP ADDRESS THE UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY THE RECENT CONTACT IS APPROVALS. AND ALLOW THE STATE TO NEGOTIATE NEW CONTACTS WITH TRIBES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN DOING SO. THESE FOUR TRIBES HAVE ALL AGREED TO ONE YEAR EXTENSIONS FOR THEIR NINETEEN NINETY NINE CONTACTS. OTHER TRIBES HAVE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED INTEREST IN A LONGER TERM EXTENSION. THE EXTENSION IS EFFECTIVELY AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONTACT FOR PURPOSES OF STATE LAW. THE AMENDMENTS WERE NEGOTIATED BY THE GOVERNOR AND MUST BE RATIFIED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. AND AMENDMENTS ONLY TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTACT UNDER FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE. THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR TO APPROVE THE EXTENSION BUT IT STILL MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT. THESE AMENDMENTS TO EXTEND THE CONTACTS FOR ONE YEAR WOULD NOT PREVENT THE STATE TRIBES FOR MUTUALLY AGREEING TO FURTHER EXTENSIONS AS NECESSARY. I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME TODAY AND I REMAIN AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VOCALOID APOLOGIES FOR MISPRONOUNCING YOUR NAME OUT AT THE TOP.

THE COULD YOU SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME I HEARD THAT YEAH THERE'S BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT A NUMBER BY A NUMBER OF TRIBES IN ONE YEAR MAY NOT BE ENOUGH OBVIOUSLY THE TRIBES HERE TODAY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN DO THIS BUT THERE'S OTHERS AND I KNOW THE MEMBERS OF HEARD THIS AND- CAN YOU COMMENT ON WHY YOU THINK A YEAR IS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S HELPFUL. BUT IT APPEARS- AT LEAST THAT'S ACCORDING TO- MY AGENDA THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THE PUBLIC- DISCUSSION FIRST AND THEN WILL ASK MEMBERS- OF THE- PRINCIPLES OF THE PARTIES TO- TOOK TO COMMENT SO- WILL NOW MOVE ON ANYONE WANT TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT- IT'S A REMINDER DUE TO CONSTRAINTS ON LAKES THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS.

THEY MIGHT BE KNOWLEDGE THE TRIBES HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND DIFFERENT NEED. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH TO TRIBAL AGREEMENT. AND THAT WE SUPPORT THE RIGHT OF TRIED TO TAKE THE ONE YEAR EXTENSION OFFERED. WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER TRIES INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF THE MEGA MEMBER TRIBE. THAT PHILIP THIRTY MONTH EXTENSION WOULD BE MUCH BETTER FIT FOR THEIR UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. FOREMOST AMONG THE FACTORS ARE MULTIPLE FEDERAL COURT CASES THAT HAVE YET TO BE RESOLVED. INCLUDING THE STATE ON APPEAL AND CHICKEN RANCH RANCHERIA THE NEWS THEM. IN THAT CASE THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN FRESNO FOUND AT THE STATE AND NOT NEGOTIATED IN GOOD FAITH WITH FIVE TRIED. TO THE STATE INSISTENCE ON INCLUDING CERTAINLY CONTACT PROVISION. WHICH THE TRIBES HAD OBJECTED INCONSISTENT WITH AGRA. THAT CASE IS NOW PENDING BEFORE THE NINTH CIRCUIT. THE DIFFERENT CORNER FRESNO NOW HAS EIGHT OTHER CASES PENDING IN VERY SIMILAR ISSUE. PUBLIC RADIO MATTERS FURTHER. EVEN TRIED TO AGREE TO THE STATE CERTAIN TODAY THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR WHICH MUST ALSO REVIEW THE COMPACT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY DISAPPROVE THEM FOR INCLUDING PROVISIONS DEEMED OUT OF THE SCOPE OF EGRA AND THEY RECENTLY DID THE LAST FOUR RATIFIED COMPAQ. AT THIS POINT EVEN IF THE CASE WERE TO BE RESOLVED. NEGOTIATING RATIFYING AND OBTAINING THE L. I APPROVAL THIRTY NEW COMPACT. COULD NOT BE COMPLETED BY JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

EVERYONE'S COMMENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. OKAY SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS FILE ITEM EIGHT SB TWELVE FIFTY ONE MOTION IS TO PASS THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE DODD I THOUGHT I'D NIELSEN ALLEN. ALLEN HI ARCHULETA ARCHULETA HI BAKER BAKER I WERE JUST GORGEOUS NO BRADFORD GLAZER WESO JONES KAMLAGER MELENDEZ MELENDEZ NO PORTANTINO RUBIO. RUBIO AYE WILK ON CULTURE THANK YOU THE BILL'S ON CALL WE'RE MOVING NOW TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN S. B. TWELVE OH THREE BY CENTER BACKER. YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU BUT CHAIR MEMBERS. SB TWELVE A THREE IS ABOUT HAVING THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S AN EXAMPLE. BY GETTING TO NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION EMISSIONS ITSELF BEFORE ASKING EVERYONE ELSE IN THE STATE TO DO SO. CALIFORNIA'S BEEN LEADING THE WORLD REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS AND ASCETICAL FOR THE WHOLE STATE TO BE NET ZERO BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WEST IN OUR COMPANIES AND OUR CITIZENS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REDUCE EMISSIONS DRAMATICALLY IN ORDER TO HIT THAT TARGET. I BELIEVE THAT WE IN STATE GOVERNMENT NEED TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE. THIS BILL SETS A PLANNING GOAL FOR ALL OF OUR STATE AGENCIES TO AIM TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO FROM THEIR OWN EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. TEN YEARS AHEAD OF THE STATE AS A WHOLE. THAT MEANS REDUCE EMISSIONS FOR STATE AGENCIES BUILDINGS AND VEHICLES EVAN ELECTRICITY THEY CONSUME. REQUIRES AGENCIES TO PUT TOGETHER PLANS TO IDENTIFY WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GET TO THIS YEAR BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND HOW MUCH IT WILL COST INTRODUCTION TO INCLUDE THOSE ACTIONS IN THE PLANNING PROCESS SEES. AN BUDGET REQUESTS. THIS BILL WE'RE BUILDING A WORK THAT MANY FIRST AGENCIES HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING. IN REPORTING THEIR EMISSIONS INVENTORIES ANNUALLY AND MAKING PROGRESS ON REDUCING EMISSIONS SINCE TWENTY TEN. THIS BILL PROVIDES A CLEAR TARGET TO MOTIVATE CONTINUED PROGRESS. TO ALLOW AGENCIES TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO AS COST EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. THE BILL PROVIDES MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN THE TECHNOLOGIES AND APPROACHES AVAILABLE. IT ALSO DIRECTS DCS IS OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY TO ACCESS THE CENTRE OF EXPERTISE AND ASSIST OTHER AGENCIES AND PLANNING EXECUTION. WHAT THE QUESTIONS ARE OFTEN HERE IS WHETHER IT'S REALLY FEASIBLE FOR STATE AGENCIES TO GET TO KNOW ZERO BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. BECAUSE WE CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT IN ITS YOUR TARGET IS ACHIEVABLE. BECAUSE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IS ALREADY SHOWING US HOW. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE UC SYSTEM SET A TARGET FOR SELF TO BE NET ZERO BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. NOT TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. GIVEN THE HOMES THEMSELVES ABOUT THE SAME OUT OF LEAD TIME IS THIS BILL WOULD GET BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND THE REPORT BE ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE THAT TARGET IN JUST A COUPLE MORE YEARS. AGAIN THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE OFF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THAT WILL PLAY PARTLY THROUGH OFFSETS IN THE HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT- WHAT. ARE HIGH QUALITY OFFSETS IN WITH THOSE- AGREED TO BE. I DO NOT TO CONCERNED AGENCIES HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED PLANS. FOR GETTING THAT ZERO. AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES THE CRIME WORKING GROUP FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION ON THIS TICKET TO REMAIN. AND SO WE- AND WE NEED A BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FEASIBILITY AND COST OF ACHIEVING THE NETS RECALL ONCE THEY DO SO. SO AGAIN PASSING THIS BILL WE'VE MADE THIS BILL. IS NOT A BINDING COMMITMENT TO THAT ZERO BY TWENTY THIRD FEB WERE COMMITTING TO UNKNOWN FUTURE BUDGET EXPENDITURES. THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE HOW FAR. AND HOW FAST. YOU GO THROUGH FUTURE BUDGET PROCREATION ONCE THOSE PLANS ARE DEVELOPED. FOR THIS BILL WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS GOING ON WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE.

MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. IN RECENT YEARS THE UNITED STATES HAS SEEN AN INCREASE IN ATTACKS ARE TOWARDS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS INCLUDING ITS AGRICULTURE AND WATER SECTORS. THESE THREATS INCREASINGLY BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC COULD HAVE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES ULTIMATELY AFFECTING BOTH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF CALIFORNIANS AND THE ECONOMIC STRENGTH OF CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE. THE CYBER ATTACKS AFFECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR FOOD AND WATER AND THESE CREATE UNCERTAINTY THAT CAN LEAD TO INCREASED RISK TO OUR FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN. A BROKEN FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN WOULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES LIVING TO INCREASE PRICES AND LESS FOOD AVAILABILITY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALREADY THAT WERE ALREADY SEEN DUE TO THE LACK OF WATER FROM DOCTOR DROUGHT AND MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCED THIS AT THE GROCERY STORE. ADDITIONALLY AS OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOTED WE NEEDED TO STRENGTH WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR CYBER PREPAREDNESS IN THE WAKE OF AN INCREASING PROBABILITY. OF RUSSIAN CYBER ATTACKS. FOR EXAMPLE OF WE KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE IN CONDUCTING SOME RESEARCH FOUND THAT. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CYBER ATTACKS- HAVE BEEN DOWN HERE AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY AN ESTIMATED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND CYBERATTACKS WITH PAYOUTS TOTALING ONE POINT TWO BILLION WERE REPORTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND CYBERATTACKS HAD ALREADY BEEN REPORTED IN THE STATE REPRESENTING IT IN AN ANNUAL INCREASE OF 62% IF TRENDS CONTINUE. WHAT ALL THIS IN MIND IT IS INCREASINGLY NECESSARY FOR STATE TO STATE PROACTIVE IN ENSURE WE ARE PREPARED IN THE EVENT OF A CYBER ATTACK ON THESE CRITICAL SECTORS. SB EIGHT NINETY TWO ISSUES OPTIONAL REPORTING GUIDELINES AROUND CALIFORNIA'S FOOD AND WATER SECTORS AND IT ENCOURAGES OUR STATE CYBERSECURITY AGENCIES. TO STRENGTHEN OUR STATE CYBERSECURITY DEFENSES. SB EIGHT NINE TWO ENCOURAGES ENTITIES IN THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE SECTOR AND WATER AND WASTE WATER SECTOR TO REPORT INSTANCES OF A VERIFIED CYBERTHREAT. OR CYBER ATTACK WITHIN THIRTY DAYS TO RELEVANT TECHNOLOGY BASED STATE AGENCIES THIS THE BILL ALSO DIRECTS OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IN THE CYBER SECURITY INTEGRATIONS TO DEVELOP PLANS TO INCREASE OUTREACH FOR CYBERSECURITY PREPAREDNESS AS WELL AS IDENTIFY POTENTIAL FUNDING SOURCES THAT SUPPORT CYBERSECURITY BUT PLACING A STRONGER FOCUS ON CYBERSECURITY NOW AND RECOGNIZING ITS IMPORTANCE TO CALIFORNIA'S. AGRICULTURE AND WATER SECTORS SB EIGHT EIGHT TWO ALLOWS CALIFORNIA TAKE A MUCH NEEDED STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF CYBER CYBERSECURITY PREPAREDNESS- AND I HAVE ONE WITNESS TODAY JOINING US REMOTELY AND THAT'S OUR JUSTICE GARBA POLICY TRIP FOR THE CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS A COMEDIAN COUNTERTOP THANK YOU- AS SENATOR THOMAS AND I'M THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATIONS PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE THE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS THE MORE THAN NINETY WATER SUPPLIERS THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION- TOGETHER WE PROVIDE SAFE CLEAN AND PORTABLE DRINKING WATER SERVICE TO ABOUT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS- I CAN SURELY LIKE TO THANK SENATOR TADO FOR OPENING DISCUSSION ON THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND BRING FORWARD SENATE BILL EIGHT NINE TWO- HER STAFF AND SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC TO WORK WITH. THREE THAT HIGH RISK SO IMPORTANT WATERSHED. IS QUITE SIMPLE WE PROVIDE THE ONLY PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICE FOR CONGESTED. ENSURING THE SAFETY WATER WE PROVIDED ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE JUST CAN'T EVER GET WRONG- AND ON THE ON THE FLIP SIDE WE FACE MERRY. THREATS CYBERSECURITY TRACKS AS WITH MOST THINGS MANY PORTIONS OF STATE WATER SYSTEMS ARE CONTROLLED REMOTELY. OPEN UNITED THEM UP TO POTENTIAL CYBERATTACKS. JUST LAST YEAR WAS WIDELY REPORTED THAT HACKERS- IN THE BAY AREA WILL BE ABLE TO I BELIEVE SOME OF THE PROGRAMS USED TO OPERATE A WATER TREATMENT PLANT THAT. SUPPLIES WATER TO CUSTOMERS IN THE BAY AREA. AND WHILE THIS TAP WAS CAUGHT AND ADDRESSED IN TIME. RELYING ON LUCK IT'S NOT A SOUND STRATEGY- NOT ONLY CAN FIBER CARE ACT AFFECT THE SAFETY OF DRINKING WATER BUT THEY CAN IMPACT EVERYTHING FROM. THE SUPPLY OF DRINKING WATER SHE WAS SIMPLY THE LOSS OF CUSTOMER- YEAH- AND THE LOSS OF PUBLIC A- PUBLIC IDEA PUBLICLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE WATER SECTOR FACES IS THE LACK OF STATE. UNIFORMS BEING FEDERAL CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS FOR WATER SUPPLIERS THE PROBLEM. ASSEMBLE A NINETY WILL HELP CLOSE THAT GAP. AND WE TRULY APPRECIATE SENATOR THOMAS WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT VITAL TOPIC. IF YOU ALL HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I MORE THAN- MIGHT HAVE TO GET DRESSED US BUT IT'S NOT THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.

ON OUR CONCERN- WE DO EXPRESS OUR CONCERN OVER CYBER SECURITY PROBLEMS AND ISSUES- BUT CURRENTLY HAVE DRAFTED WE ARE- A LITTLE BIT UNSURE HOW IT WOULD WORK THROUGHOUT.

AND I CAN APPRECIATE WHAT THE OP HAS STAYED AND YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH THAT I JUST WANT A LITTLE BIT CLARIFICATION IF I MAY ADDRESS THE AUTHOR. QUESTION TO THE OTHER. WE ARE AND THAT IS YOU KNOW AS I'M READING THE BILL AND I THINK I READ SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT ALSO CAME FROM THE OPPOSITION. I'M READING HERE THAT IT'S COMPLETELY OPTIONAL AND THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO SIMPLY OPT OUT CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT FOR ME PLEASE. YOU SO. THE BILL WAS AMENDED AT BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE OPPOSITION RAISED- IN REGARDS TO- MANDATING RIGHT- AT BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY REPORTING THAT IS DONE. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND SO. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO BE. ON FOR YOU HAVE YOUR SITE AT. LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE GOT IT WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO STAY THAT AS PER WITH A IN FOR. AND SO WE OF COURSE WANT TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AND WE MADE IT UP OPTIONAL REPORTING. I SO IT'S NO LONGER ADD MANDATORY. THANK YOU FOR THAT SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE I GUESS I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S OPPOSITION BUT WHEN I SEE THAT THIS IS COMPLETE. ARE COMPLETELY OPTIONAL I THINK IT'S WORTH MOVING FORWARD AND YOU KNOW I'M A SHIRT BUT BASED ON THE COMMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION THAT THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN OPEN TO WORKING WITH THEM AND- AND I THINK THE FACT THAT IT'S COMPLETELY OPTIONAL I THINK THAT- IT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I WITH THE BILL. THANK U. S. SENATOR RUBIO ANYBODY ELSE WISHING.

ALL RIGHT SO I AM PRESENTING SB NINE NINE THREE. WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR VICTIMS COMPENSATION. OF PROCESS AND ALSO SOME- REVISIONS TO OUR FLEXIBLE ASSISTANCE. SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE. ON GRANT PROGRAM. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESTABLISH THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD WHICH PROVIDES FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND SERVICES TO CRIME VICTIMS AND TO EXONERATE. NOW WHAT WE'VE FOUND AND THERE'S GOOD DATA SUPPORTING THIS THAT PROVIDING SUCH SUPPORT. INCREASES COMMUNITY SAFETY. IMPROVES THE TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND VICTIMS AND LEAVES. RETIRED REDUCES RETALIATION CRIMES THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN THE VICTIM OF CRIME FEELS THAT THERE ARE NOT THAT THE- THERE'S NOT BEEN AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE THEY'VE NOT BEEN ASSISTED HERE'S YOU KNOW THE CRIME IS NOT BEING SOLVED AND WE HAVE SEEN IN MANY CASES WHERE. CRIME IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ENDS UP BEING THIS- CYCLE OF KIND OF RETALIATORY CRIMES WHICH DOES NOT BENEFIT ANYONE. NOW THIS IMPORTANT SERVICE IS UNDERFUNDED AND GOVERNED BY STATUTORY LANGUAGE THAT HAS PREVENTED MANY CRIME SURVIVORS FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCESS FUNDS OR RECEIVE THE HELP THEY NEED. AND DISTINCTIONS ABOUT WHO DESERVES HELP WHEN THEY'VE EXPERIENCED A CRIME LEAVES MANY VICTIMS LEAVING FEELING LEFT OUT OF THE PROTECTION OUR PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE AND I THINK ALL OF US KNOW. IF WE ANY OF US ARE EVER SUBJECT TO A VIOLENT CRIME WE'RE OTHER CRIME THAT WE ALL DESERVE SUPPORT IF THE STATE HAS DEVELOPED A SYSTEM TO PROVIDE SUCH SUPPORT. WHAT SB NINE NINE THREE DOES IS IMPROVES ACCESS TO SUPPORT AND SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS OF CRIME AND TO EXONERATION THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE. WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND INCREASES THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT A CRIME SURVIVOR CAN RECEIVE AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK MY WITNESSES- TOUR HERE- I BELIEVE ON A CALL LINE TO PROVIDERS- CAST MONIQUE. AND MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CARTOONISH ROLLINS WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CRIME SURVIVORS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND MARK HUGHES THE DIRECTOR OF YOUTH ALIVE WHICH IS A VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAM.

CCJ IS PROUD TO SPONSOR SB NINE THREE THREE AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK SENATOR SKINNER FOR CHAMPIONING. THIS GROUNDBREAKING LEGISLATION. BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SEND PRAYER AND CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVING FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WERE IMPACTED BY THE MASS SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE. JUST A BLOCK AWAY FROM THIS BUILDING. AND I SPENT THIS MORNING READING THE NAMES OF HOSE ITEMS ARE LEARNING ABOUT THEIR LOVED ONES AS THEY DESCRIBE THEM AND THOSE WHO WERE LEFT BEHIND. AS A SURVIVING FAMILY MEMBER OF TWO HOMICIDE VICTIMS SOMEONE WHO LOVES TO READ AND THEN VIOLENCE IN THE TRAUMA. I UNDERSTAND THE TRAUMA THAT CAUSED. DAMAGE TO MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY I UNDERSTAND WITH THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF THIS EXPERIENCE ARE GOING THROUGH. SOME OF THOSE JOBS HOMES SO MAY LITERALLY LOSE LIVE I'M SELF MEDICATING IN BEING UNABLE TO COPE WITH THE PAIN OF THE PROBLEM. LYFT COMES VERY COMPLICATED EXPENSIVE AND CONFUSING FOR VICTIMS AND FAMILY MEMBERS AFTER CRIME IN ANY BARRIER TO GETTING HELP OR SUPPORT CAUSES MORE TRAUMA IT CAN PLACE PEOPLE IN DANGER. IN THIS MOMENT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ASSESS THE NEEDS OF ALL VICTIMS THIS IS THE IN THE BEST IT IS THE SAFE. AND IT THE NIGHT HE IS A BILL. THAT WILL HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN MAKE THAT REAL COME. FOR NATIONAL LEAGUE. FORTUNE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN LEGAL BAY TO HIM THIS BILL WOULD REMOVE DOZEN OF LEGAL BARRIERS IN PREVENT PREVENT CRIME AND SO WILL GIVE SYSTEM IT WOULD REDUCE TAPE IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS INCREASED FLEXIBILITY IN FUNDS INCREASE RESPONSE TIME FOR FOLKS MAKE SURE THAT THE OUT REACH PROGRAMS REALLY TOUCH THE COMMUNITY AND THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET ACCESS TO THE HELP THAT THEY NEED IT WOULD LESSEN THE RATE VARIES THAT HAVE. ANY PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST. BY CRIME FROM GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. AGAIN HELPING VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE STATE.

AND SENATE BILL NINE NINE THREE WILL OPEN DOORS- IT IS SO IMPORTANT WE RECOGNISE FAMILIES IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SITUATION THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW THE ANGUISH THE PAIN- AND THE EXPENSE OF THE FUNERALS IN STRONG ONE. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US IN THE SENATE TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND SAY WE DO CARE ABOUT THE VICTIMS WE DO CARE ABOUT THE VICTIMS OF CRIME AND THAT WE'RE TAKING THIS STEP FORWARD.

THE TRAGEDY DOESN'T JUST STOP WITH THE CRIME IT'S WHAT'S LEFT IN THE AFTERMATH WITH FAMILIES TRYING TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER WITH YOU KNOW VICTIM STRUGGLING TO RECOVER AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH IT SO I'MREALLY PLEASED TO SEE THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD IN ANYTHING AGAIN THAT WE CAN DO TO INCREASE FINANCIAL SUPPORT SO THEY CAN GET.

SKEWS ME SUTTER AS OF SERGEANTS YOUR MIND THAT'S OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN I PUT IT UP A LITTLE LATE APOLOGIES- SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BY THERE ARE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS I WANNA MAKE- I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT. THE FUNDING FOR THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM- IS AT RISK IT IS NEARING INSOLVENCY IN OVER. THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS THIS BODY HAS. DECREASED THE ABILITY TO COLLECT FUNDS FOR THIS PROGRAM IN THE IN THAT WE HAVE REDUCED FINES AND FEES- YOU KNOW. FOR- CHECK TICKETS YOU KNOW TO GET REVENUE IN PARTICULAR- IN AND THEN OF COURSE WE'VE INCREASED- THE ABILITY FOR OTHERS TO COLLECT FROM THIS BE SO WE'RE INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CAN USE THIS REVENUE- WE'RE DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE AND WE DON'T HAVE A DURING A DEDICATED FUNDING STREAM FOR THIS AND THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED OTHERWISE THERE WON'T BE ANY MONEY FOR ANYBODY IN THE FUTURE- SO I REALIZE THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF YOUR BILL SENATORS SKINNER- AND I APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT AT SOME POINT THIS ODY HAS TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE DEPLETING THIS FIND. AND IT'S NOT GONNA FEEL GOOD ANYMORE TO SAY YOU'RE EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM IF THERE'S NOTHING IN IT TO GET THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OKAY- THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED. UP BY SENATOR RUBIO. THE MOTIONS TO PASS TO PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT FIRST CENTER SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH TERROR AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES AND SENATOR TO LEAD TO YOUR REFERENCE THE JUST. HORRIBLE TRAGEDY OF SATURDAY NIGHT. WITH THAT. MASS SHOOTING. AND WE I THINK ALL OF US WERE RELIEVED TO SEE THAT AT LEAST ONE ARREST HAS BEEN MADE. NOW IN SUCH AND WE HOPE THAT THE PERPETRATORS ARE FOUND. AND THAT WE- THE ANTI- TRIED- HAND THAT WE GET US A RESOLUTION TO THIS HORRIBLEMASS SHOOTING BUT WHAT WE FIND SO OFTEN IN SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE SHOOTINGS OCCURRED. IS THAT THERE'S- WE NEED COOPERATION WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO IDENTIFY SUSPECTS AND MAKE THE ARRESTS AND THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO KEEP US SAFER AND SO THANK GOODNESS THERE WERE. EITHER OBSERVERS ARE VICTIMS IN THIS SITUATION ON SATURDAY NIGHT WHO COOPERATED WITH THE POLICE THANK GOODNESS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE AND OF COURSE PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THOSE WHO'VE EXPERIENCED THESE AWFUL INCIDENTS. IS GOING TO ASSIST US IN DOING THAT NOW I ALSO WANT TO JUST BE CLEAR IN CASE SOMEONE FEELS THAT THIS THESE CHANGES WILL SOMEHOW ONLY BENEFIT CERTAIN VICTIMS NO WE'RE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL IMPROVE ALL WE'RE NOT CREATING A ZERO SUM GAME. AND TO SENATOR MELENDEZ COMMENTS- YES THE DEPENDENCE THE FUND'S DEPENDENCE ON THE FINES OR FEES LIKE SO MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE MADE DEPENDENT ON SUCH THINGS. HAS MADE THE FIND LESS STABLE AND SO WE WILL IF THIS BILL IS SUCCESSFUL WE WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT AND AS THE BUDGET YEAR. I INTEND TO WHILE I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO PRESUME WE HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS PROCEEDS THROUGH THE PROCESS IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO DO WHICH IS TO- ADJUST AND IMPROVE THE FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN SUPPORT VICTIMS.

SEVEN ZERO TERMINAL CALL SEVEN ZERO THAT BILLS ON CALL THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER. WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WELL I DON'T SEE SENATOR MEN WE IS HERE GREAT ONE ZERO ZERO ONE FOR THURMOND YOU BIG BABY YET. CAN'T GIVE ME THAT EASILY CHAIRED- I THANK YOU AND MEMBER THANK YOU MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE IN THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL- I RISE TO PRESENT SB ONE THOUSAND ONE WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER. ALSO KNOWN AS CAL CYSTIC TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF REQUIRING CREDIT REPORTING BUREAUS AND LENDERS TO UTILIZE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SECURITY TACTICS. TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM FINANCIAL FRAUD. UNFORTUNATELY AS WE ALL KNOW IDENTITY THEFT AND FINANCIAL FRAUD ARE IT PER SE PERVASIVE AND MASSIVELY GROWING PROBLEMS IN OUR SOCIETY- WITH THE RISE OF THE INTERNET AND- ONLINE TRANSACTIONS. I IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE ALONE THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION RECEIVED NEARLY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION IDENTITY THEFT INCIDENT REPORTS. WHICH WAS UP FROM TWO POINT ONE MILLION. REPORTS RECIBIR PRIOR AND THE STAFF DO NOT COME WITHOUT A COST EVERY DAY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE CONSUMERS REPORTED LOSING MORE THAN FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO FRAUD. INDICATING AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN 70% FROM TWENTY TWENTY ATTACKS TO INDIVIDUALS THEIR LOVED ONES HOWEVER IS DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE. BECAUSE ONCE A PERSON'S IDENTIFYING INFORMATION STOLEN IT CAN POSE A LONG TERM THREAT TO ONE'S WELL BEING. CREDIT REPORTING BUREAUS HOUSE SOME OF OUR MOST SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EQUIFAX DATA BREACH IS A WAKE UP CALL FOR EVERYONE PROVING THAT WE NEEDED TO KEEP UP WITH THE L. VAULTING IDENTITY THEFT CRIME MARKET. I PERSONALLY WAS A VICTIM OF THAT ATTACK MY INFORMATION LIKE MANY PROBABLY IN THIS CHAMBER WAS EXPOSED- MY FAMILY AND I WERE ALSO EXPOSED AS PART OF SUBSEQUENT BREACH OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT EMPLOYEE- AND THEN ALSO WITH T. MOBILE WE'RE I'M A CUSTOMER. AND I SAY THIS ONLY TO POINT OUT THAT. IDENTITY THEFT- ARE LOTS OF INFORMATION. IS UBIQUITOUS AND LIKELY TO IMPACT ALMOST ALL OF US IN THE VERY VERY NEAR FUTURE. MY KIDS RIGHT NOW I RECEIVED MAYBE EVERY MONTH OR SO A REPORT SAYING THAT THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ARE ON THE DARK WEB. ON SO WE NEED SOME ANSWERS HERE AND THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TO TRY TO. COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS. IT WILL REQUIRE THIS CAL CYSTIC TO RESEARCH POTENTIAL IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION TOOLS. INCLUDING MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION EACH TIME A NEW LINE OF CREDIT IS OPEN OR CREDIT REPORTS ACCESS. UTILIZING POTENTIALLY STATEWIDE ALTERNATIVES TO SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AS AN AUTHORIZATION. CLING POTENTIALLY A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER PLUS OR WHAT'S CALLED A MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE- THIS BILL WILL HELP INFORM OUR LEGISLATURE HOPEFULLY WE CAN. WITH THAT INFORMATION COME UP WITH THE SOLUTIONS- TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY AS WE'VE ALWAYS DONE. I IN PROTECTING OUR CITIZENS FROM IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD. THANK YOU TURNOUT. THANK YOU ANYBODY WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THE NOBODY. IN THE CHAMBERS- OF MODERATOR- CAN WE- OPEN LINES AND SEE IF ANYBODY IS ON THE LINE TO SUPPORT OF. SB. TEN OH ONE.

OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION ANYBODY ELSE SENATOR BORDERS PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE WORK THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DONE AND CONTINUES TO DO IN THE SPACE- I THINK- THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN- CYBERSECURITY AND IDENTITY THEFT- THIS IS OUR NEW REALITY. AND WE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING AT MANY OF THESE ISSUES TACTICALLY. BUT MORE- FROM A STRATEGIC STANDPOINT. DO WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE WHERE WITH ALL TO STICK TO KEEP UP AT THE PACE. THAT MALWARE AND RANSOMWARE AND IDENTITY THEFT. OPERATORS WITH THEIR ONGOING SOPHISTICATION. ARE OPERATING- TO MATCH OUR TACTICAL MEANS SO I WANTED TO CONGRATULATE YOU CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTIVE AND APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU DO. THANK YOU SENATE. THANK YOU CENTER MELENDEZ THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I'M- SENATE SENATOR MAN CYSTIC TO SUBMIT THEIR REPORT TO LEGISLATURE IN THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF REQUIRING CREDIT LENDERS TO IMPLEMENT NEW INFORMATION SECURITY TACTICS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM FINANCIAL FRAUD- IN THIS AGENCY. I'M LOOKING AT WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE CAN YOU TELL ME- WHAT SUCCESS THEY HAVE HAD SO FAR SINCE THEIR INCEPTION IN THWARTING- THESE TYPES OF ATTACKS- SO I JUST ACTUALLY VISITED CAL CYSTIC A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AS YOU ARE AWARE CENTER THEY'RE A RELATIVELY NEW I DON'T BELIEVE IN AGENCY AT THIS POINT THERE ARE A PART OF CAL OH YES. MY UNDERSTANDING BUT THE- HAVE. I THINK BEEN FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL SO FAR IN TRYING TO COORDINATE BEST PRACTICES. I AM TRYING TO FEND OFF. A CYBER SECURITY TAX- I CAN'T SPEAK TO ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE OBSERVE JUST BECAUSE I KNOW SOME OF THAT SENSITIVE INFORMATION- BY IN VISITING THEM IN IN TALKING WITH OTHER AGENCY HEADS I THINK THAT THERE SO FAR SEEN AS A KIND OF A MODEL FOR THE NATION TO FOLLOW. I BELIEVE IN THE NEAR FUTURE THEY'LL BE LEADING. A COORDINATION OF A NUMBERS STATION AND- THE SENSE THAT I'M GETTING FROM OTHER STATES AS A CALIFORNIA HAS THE BEST PRACTICES- SO AS FAR AS BEATING UP OUR CYBER SECURITY- I THINK THAT WE'RE DOING. THE RIGHT JOB I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT WE FENDED OFF. CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS BUT- BY MY BELIEF IS YOU KNOW IT WITH IN CONCERT WITH. SOME OF THE LEADING. CYBERSECURITY PREVENTION PRIVATE FIRMS WHICH ARE BASED IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW- THE THEY ARE SEEN AS A- A GROWING MODEL NOW THIS IS KIND OF NEW AS FAR AS GOVERNMENT ACTION- WE- WE ARE TRYING TO. WADE INTO IT NEW SPACE HERE IN AND SET PRECEDENTS THAT REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN SET YET BUT- YOU KNOW MY SENSE SO FAR IS THAT THEY ARE SEEN AS SUCCESS. OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT- I'M JUST. YOU KNOW I'M LOOKING HERE AS ENVISIONED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE DEVELOPING A STATEWIDE CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY OVERSEEING A CYBER INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM WHICH SERVICE CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY UNIT IN CYBER THREAT DETECTION REPORTING IN RESPONSE FOR THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS ASSISTING LAW ENFORCEMENT- FROM COLLECTING AND SHARING CYBER THREAT INFORMATION IT SEEMS LIKE. THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN TASKED WITH ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOUR BILL- PROPOSES TO DO THERE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY INFORMATION YET ARE DATA TO SUGGEST THAT THEY HAVE BEEN LARGELY SUCCESSFUL- IN THEIR EFFORTS WELL I'M AS DEFINED IN THE BEGINNING SO IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T SUPPORT THE IDEA I'M JUST MY HEAD THAT PERHAPS WE'RE GIVING THEM MORE AND THEY SEEM TO DO THE WHOLE POINT BEHIND CREATING CAO CYSTIC WAS IT WAS THIS. THINK TANK THAT- NEW CERTAINLY MORE THAN THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE OF HOW TO ADDRESS THIS. ISSUE AND LIKELY WOULD. MAKE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS YOU KNOW TO THE LEGISLATURE REGARDLESS OF IF WE MANDATE OR NOT MEAN THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THEIR EXISTENCE- SEVEN THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION. IF I MIGHT JUST RESPOND JUST TO BE CLARIFIED THAT WHAT CAL CYSTIC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IS CYBER SECURITY PREVENTION I WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO WITH THIS BILL IS A SOME PARTICULAR CHANGES I IN PRACTICE AROUND- THE CREDIT REPORTING BUREAUS IN THE RELATIONSHIP LENDERS WHICH HOUSES IT DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO- AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING CONTEMPLATING IS WHETHER IT WOULD MAKE SENSE. TO HAVE MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION EVERY TIME YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT OPENED OUT WHETHER WE SHOULD CREATE ALTERNATIVES TO SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. SO SCARY NUMBERS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE ASSOCIATE WITH ARDENT IDENTIFICATION. I'VE JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE TIED TO SO MUCH ANCILLARY INFORMATION BUT THE IDEA THAT YOUR SSN IS USED AS YOUR PRIMARY POINT OF AUTHORIZATION THAT IS TO SAY. YOU GIVEN SSN. AND YOU HAVE ACCESS TO OPENING UP FINANCIAL. ACCOUNTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AYE DADDY SCENE IS VERY OUTDATED THAT THIS NINE DIGIT NUMBER SHOULD SERVE THAT PURPOSE. ALSO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS AN ALTERNATIVE- THERE'S BEEN SOME DEBATE AND SO WE HAVE THE CYBER SECURITY- SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING WHICH I CHAIR. RECENTLY AND I THINK CENTER BOARD JUST WAS PART OF THAT. AND I THINK THIS SET CONSENSUS WAS THAT THE NEED TO BE MORE STUDY BUT WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES SHOULD BE SO. THIS PARTICULAR STUDY IS VERY FOCUSED. ON HOW WE CAN CREATE A BERRIER STATE ANY THEFT AND FINANCIAL FRAUD PARTICULAR NOT CYBER SECURITY INCURSIONS BUT HOW CAN PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM THAT FIXING PROBLEM THAT IS HITTING SO MANY OF US. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE CIVIC CENTER BACKER. YEAH I WOULD. WHICH CAN THINK ON THEIR FOR HIS WORK ON THIS BILL CERTAINLY THESE THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES HAVE JUST VAST VAST VAST AMOUNTS OF DATA AND LOOKING AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO. MAKE SURE IT'S PROTECTED I THINK IS VERY VALUABLE AMOUNT DATABROKER BILL THAT WILL- IF YOU TALK ABOUT LATER BUT- I JUST APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS AREA. THANKS AND- GREAT- OKAY- SEARCH WHAT AT THE BEGINNING DID YOU MOVE THIS BILL YEAH THAT'S RIGHT OKAY SO THE MOVEMENT BUILT IN NEARBY CENTER ARCHULETA THE PAT THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED JUST VERY SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HI DOT HI NIELSEN ALLEN ARCHULETA ARCHULETA I'D BAKER. BAKER I BORDERS REGIS I BRADFORD GLAZER GLAZER IGHT WESO JONES KAMLAGER MELENDEZ. MELENDEZ AYE PORTANTINO RUBIO. RUBIO AYE WILK ITEM ON CALL- SO WE ALL. NOTED SENATOR- THE S. B. TEN- FOR A FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE HAS- IN WHICH WOULD DRAW ON. BUT THIS POINT IN TIME. HM SUTTER ARCHULETA WOULD YOU LIKE TO- PRESENT. PLEASE PROCEED CENTER ARCHULETA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS MORNING I AM HERE TO REPRESENT SENATE BILL ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN AND IMPROVE THE SMALL BUSINESS AND DISABLED VETERANS BENEFITS BUSINESS ENTERPRISE AND THE PROGRAMS THEY'RE UP. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WILL INCREASE THE MAXIMUM CONTRACT AMOUNT FOR SERVICES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONTRACTS AWARDED THROUGH THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND DISABLED VETERANS BUSINESS ENTERPRISE OPTION FROM THE SMALL BUSINESS DISABLED VETERANS BUSINESS ENTERPRISE CONTRACTING OPTION IS A STREAMLINED PROCUREMENT. ASSESSED FOR CERTIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES MICRO BUSINESSES OR DISABLED VETERAN'S BUSINESS ENTERPRISES THE OPTION ALLOW STATE DEPARTMENTS TO CONTRACT DIRECTLY WITH CERTIFIED SMALL BUSINESS DISABLED VETERANS ENTERPRISE FOR GOODS SERVICES OR I. T. AS LONG AS THE AGENCY ALSO OBTAINS QUOTES FROM TWO SMALL BUSINESS. VETERANS ENTERPRISES. OTHER STATES SMALL AND VETERAN- BUSINESSES HAVE FACED UNIQUE CHALLENGES. IN OUR STATE IS NO DIFFERENT OUR BUSINESS ENTERPRISE THEY FACE ON OUR VETERANS FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AND MANY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CLOSE OUR DOORS AND OR LAY OFF STAFF. HIS INCREASE TO THE SMALL BUSINESS DISABLED VETERANS BUSINESS ENTERPRISE OPTION IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. BUSINESSES IN THE STATE HAVE STRUGGLED WITH INFLATION INCREASED EXPENSES DRIVING UP THE COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES AND NO DIFFERENT FROM THE SMALL BUSINESSES. SENATE BILL FORTY SEVENTY EIGHT INCREASES THE MAXIMUM CONTRACT AWARD FROM TO FOR A 200-500-0025 HUNDRED THOUSAND TO ALLOW SMALL IN BETTER IS BUSINESS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE COMPETITIVE WHEN BIDDING FOR STATE CONTRACTS WHILE ALSO INCREASING THE AMOUNT THEY CAN BENEFIT FINANCIALLY FROM BY DOING BUSINESS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. INCREASING THE OPTION TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOULD HELP ADDRESS RAISING COSTS AND INFLATION WHILE ALSO. ENSURING THAT THRESHOLD. IS APPROPRIATE FOR pGOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT AWARD CONTRACTS FOR THE DEPARTMENTS BUT TO IN FOR VETERANS. WITH SMALL BUSINESSES AND VETERAN OWNED COMPANIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. EQUITABLE RECOVERY REQUIRES EMPHASIS ON THESE BUSINESS GROUPS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE SERIES OF BILLS RECOMMENDED BY THE STATE AUDITOR. TO IMPROVE THIS AND STRENGTHEN THE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO THE LEGISLATION RE REGARDING OVERSIGHT ADVOCATES FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS DISABLED VETERANS BUSINESS ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY MET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. AND ITS LEADERSHIP TO REQUEST BETTER REPORTING IN THE PRIME AND SUBCONTRACTOR UTILIZATION. THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES DEVELOP AN ANNUAL REPORT THAT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM BY TRACKING REPORTING IN PRIME AND SUBCONTRACT UTILIZATION AND OBTAINING CRUCIAL DATA. RIGHT TO THE CREATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT BY SMALL BUSINESS DISABLED VETERANS BUSINESS ENTERPRISE THERE WAS NO WAY TO TRACK THE SUBCONTRACT WORK. WE CAN NOW HAVE A CLEAR AND ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE SUCCESSES OF THE SMALL BUSINESS DISABLED VETERANS BUSINESS ENTERPRISE. AT THE PRIME AND SUBPRIME LEVELS THESE VESTS FOR EACH THESE EFFORTS WITH ACCUMULATION OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE SMALL BUSINESS DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY TO IMPROVE ON THE PROGRAM. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WILL HELP SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESSES DISABLED VETERANS BUSINESS ON ENTERPRISE IT WAS STRENGTHENING THE PROGRAMS AND OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES.

THE LINE FIFTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MR CARE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PHIL VERMAELEN I REPRESENT THE COALITION A SMALL A DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESSES- I ALSO SERVE ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY TASK FORCE FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS AND LAST YEAR WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMERCIALLY USEFUL FUNCTION COMMITTEE- ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS IS THERE ARE MANY LARGE BUSINESSES THAT WILL GO IN THE AN OFFER A SMALL BUSINESSES 82% SPIFF AS WE CALL IT. TO ALLOW THEM TO UTILIZE THE SMALL BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESS- IT PROGRAMS THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE TALKING YOU HAVE TO CLARIFY THERE IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY AND THAT IS THE TO CALL SYSTEM SO FOR EXAMPLE UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS DGS NOW FROM THERE BUYERS CAN CALL TO PEOPLE THAT ARE CERTIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES ARE DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESSES. AND OBTAIN A PRICE FROM THEM THAT'S ALL GREAT AND WONDERFUL- THEY WERE BEEN FOR DIFFERENT TIMES. THIS BILL HAS BEEN. BUT THROUGH THE LEAD. WE HAVE BEEN ACT. OPPOSED THE WHOLE TIME IT'S COUNTER TO THE BY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AND THINK WELL GEEZ WE'RE GONNA RAISE AT THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. REMEMBER FOR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE TO RAISE THOSE KINDS OF FUNDS FROM. BANK ALONE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OUT THAT LOAN TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PRODUCT. OF A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES CARE IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. ON THE AUDIENCE OVERLAP NUMEROUS YEARS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROGRAMS THE BASS MAJORITY AT THE BP AND SMALL BUSINESSES. ARE NOT GETTING THE BENEFITS FROM THE REYES FROM TO AT UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY IF YOU MAKE IT UP TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT AGAIN IS GOING TO BENEFIT SOME PEOPLE THERE ARE NUMEROUS THINGS WE CAN DO WE NEED TO TIGHTEN THE LAWS FOR EXAMPLE- ONE OF THE PROBLEM. THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES DID AWAY WITH WHAT WE CALL CONTRACTS ONE OF MYERS SEVERAL OF MY MEMBERS A COUPLE YEARS AGO LOST OVER A MILLION DOLLARS ON A CONTRACT WITH THE STATE. WHERE THEY ACTUALLY CONTRACTED WITH THE STATE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS THEY HAVE TO ORDER THOSE PRODUCTS. AND AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE AND THEN GIVE YOU A MAP OVER THE YEAR THE CONTRACT UNFORTUNATELY THE STATE HAS THE RIGHT NOW. TO ELIMINATE THOSE CONTRACTS IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THINGS CHANGE SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY CONTRACT A ONE PLANET GREEN. THAT IT BURNS SMALL BUSINESSES THAT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO CLARIFY WE NEED TO GET THAT RESOLVED BECAUSE THAT ALMOST RATES OF ALL MY BILLS. MY MEMBERS OUT OF BUSINESS BUT BY RAISING A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL OVER THOSE. BUYERS IN TERMS OF WHO THE TWO PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT AND REACH OUT TO YOU. AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY IS WHY IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS- THAT THEY ARE GOING TO A VAST MAJORITY OF US BY THE HANDFUL. OF BUSINESS IS NOT TO. ASKED ME TO OF PEOPLE IT SHOULD BE OUT THERE WITH ARE SMALL BUSINESS HELLO THREE I PLEDGE TO WORK THE SENATE ON COMING UP WITH SOME THAT WILL WORK BUT INCREASE THE LIMIT OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS JUST GOING TO PROMOTE MORE FRAUD SO FOR THOSE REASONS UNFORTUNATELY WE OPPOSE THE BILL AS IT. CURRENTLY READS THANK YOU VERMILION WHEN HE SAID WE- IT YOU REPRESENTING A- UTAH'S WHAT WHAT WERE YOU WHICH IS A SMALL AND DISABLED. OKAY SO THE COALITION IS SMALL AND STABLE VETERAN BUSINESSES I THANK YOU I AM A LOTTERY OR ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE ARE GOING TO BRING THIS BACK TO OUR MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- I'M NOT SEEN ANYBODY I'D SERIOUS- CONCERN HERE- SAID ARCHULETA. DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES YES PLEASE PROCEED YES ONCE AGAIN AND I'LL BRING IN THE EXPERT THAT  BROUGHT IN BUT ONCE AGAIN HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE VETERANS- TO COME TOGETHER TO START OPENING UP THEIR BUSINESS TO BE COMPETITIVE AND IN TODAY'S WORLD TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IS AS A SMALL SMALL AMOUNT. AND IS SO NOW THEY'LL BE ABLE TO BE COMPETITIVE IN REACH UP TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UP TO NOT NECESSARILY THE FIVE AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESSES THAT YOU'VE HEARD ARE ARE WITH US THE OTHER THE THING THAT WAS MENTIONED BUT FRAUD IT'S A MINUTE MIGHT MUTE- AMOUNT IN BECAUSE OF THE- THE OVERSIGHT THAT'S THERE- WE ARE IN GOOD SHAPE AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL. AS THE LAST ONE WILL OPEN DOORS FOR ME MORE AND MORE VETERANS INVOLVED BUSINESSES AND SO WITH THAT AYE RICHER AYE VOTE. OKAY ANYBODY- ANY MEMBERS WISHING TO- MOVE THIS BILL. SUTTER GLAZER THANK YOU THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO MILITARY VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. A SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. DODD I THOUGHT I'D NIELSEN ALLEN ARCHULETA AYE ARCHULETA AYE BAKER. BAKER HI GORGEOUS BRADFORD GLAZER GLAZER HI WESO JONES KAMLAGER MELENDEZ MELENDEZ I PORTANTINO RUBIO. RUBIO I WILL ARE CALL CENTER WIENER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- PATIENTS THANK YOU MR THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA. SO WE'RE MOVING NOW TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX S. B. ELEVEN FORTY FOUR I CENTER WIENER CENTER YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO YOU IN THE COMMITTEE. OUR COLLEAGUES THAT I'M PRESENTING SENATE BILL ELEVEN FORTY FOR THE SAFE AND EFFICIENT WATER ACT. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS A LEADING EXAMPLE FOR THE NATION AND WORLD- WITH SO MANY OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICIES. HOWEVER TRAGICALLY OUR DRINKING WATER REGULATIONS DO NOT ALWAYS PASS MUSTER. I KNOW WHERE IS THIS MORE EVIDENT THAN IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS DATA COLLECTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY- SHOW THAT 53% OF REPORTING SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOUND LEAD IN AT LEAST ONE OF THEIR DRINKING WATER FOUND. GUNS ON CAMPUS. LET OF COURSE IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS FOR EVERYONE PARTICULARLY CHILDREN. I'M AFRAID IN TWENTY ONE HUNDRED DRINKING WATER FOUNTAINS TESTED POSITIVE FOR LEAD IN THIRTEEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY THIS ISSUE- DOESN'T STOP WITH LET THE SAME WATER SYSTEMS I MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSING STUDENTS TO LEASE AN HOUR RATE ON AN ARM AND A HOST OF OTHER POTENTIALLY HARMFUL CONTAMINANTS. I HOWEVER THE TESTING THE BROUGHT- THE DATA AROUND LED TO LIGHT DID NOT REQUIRE TESTING FOR ANY OF THESE OTHER CONTAMINANTS. WITHOUT A TESTING REGIME STATE WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE- IN DARKNESS- ASSUMING THAT SCHOOLS AND STATE AGENCIES ARE FOR FILLING EVERY CALIFORNIANS RIGHT TO CLEAN AND SAFE WATER WHEN THAT ASSUMPTION TRAGICALLY IS NOT WARRANTED NOT AND- NOT BECAUSE OF INTENTIONAL HARM- BUT BECAUSE WE'RE SIMPLY NOT DOING INSPECTIONS. SB ELEVEN FORTY FOUR WILL REMEDY THE SITUATION BY REQUIRING ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS WELL AS STATE AGENCIES FOR STATE OWNED BUILDINGS TO COMPLETE A WATER QUALITY ASSESSMENT ON THEIR FACILITIES. INCLUDING TESTING PER LED RATE ON A LEGIONELLA AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS IF THEY FIND A CONTAMINANT THE OPERATING AGENCY WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPLACE THE FIXTURE AT THE EARLIEST PRACTICAL TIME SUBJECT TO FUNDING- AND ALSO. TO PROVIDE NOTIFICATIONS SO PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEIR IS AN ISSUE- IF. DAY FUNDS IS NOT A- IN. IS NOT KERR POSSIBLE- THE OPERATING- AGENCY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PREPARE WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN. TO INCLUDE INTERIM REMEDIATION MEASURES AS WELL AS REGULAR TESTING. ON A MAJOR REASON FOR CONTAMINATION OF SCHOOLS AND STATE AGENCIES IS THE AGE OF BUILDINGS OLDER PLUMBING SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION. AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO CONTAIN SOME. ASPECT OF LEAD FROM THE PIPES ADDITIONALLY THESE OLD SYSTEMS ARE LIKELY TO BE INEFFICIENT EITHER BY LEAKING AND WASTING. A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER- OR BY SIMPLY BEING AN EFFICIENT AND UTILIZING EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS. OF WATER SB ONE FORTY FOUR WILL ADDITIONALLY REQUIRE SCHOOLS AND STATE AGENCIES TO TEST THEIR WATER EFFICIENCY- AND SUBJECT TO FUNDING. OF REPLACE FIXTURES OR APPLIANCES THAT DON'T MEET WATER EFFICIENCY STANDARDS. FINALLY THE BILL WILL REQUIRE SCHOOLS AND STATE AGENCIES. TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF INSTALLING AN ONSITE GREYWATER SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT WATER RECYCLING AS PART OF. CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE- WE ARE WORKING CURRENTLY ON AMENDMENTS WITH- WHATEVER USE- REGARDING THIS- GRAY WATER PROVISION TO BROADEN AT- AND ALLOW CONNECTION TO ALTERNATIVE RECYCLED WATER SYSTEMS. RATHER THAN EXCLUSIVELY OUR GRAY WATER- SO WE- OUR INTENT IS TO INCORPORATE- THOSE MOMENTS IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE IF THE COMMITTEE PASSES THE BILL TODAY- THIS TESTING. BOTH OF POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION IN WATER% QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY ACROSS BUILDINGS THAT HOUSE OR USE PUBLIC SERVANTS AND A HOST OF OTHER CALIFORNIANS WILL ENSURE THAT THE STATE IS PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO CLEAN SAFE WATER. AND IS CONSERVING THIS PRECIOUS RESOURCE- COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS ARE WELL WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY. OR SCOTT WHAT'S ON BEHALF OF OUR SPONSORED THE STATE PIPES. COUNCIL AS WELL AS THOMAS AND ON THE OF THE- SO. OF PLUMBING AND THE KIND OF OFFICIALS. MORNING MR WEBB'S PLEASE PROCEED. MISTER CHAIRMAN A MEMBER SCOTT WENT SHOULD BE HALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARK TRADES COUNCIL THE PATRIOTS COUNCIL REPRESENTS LOCAL PLUMBING INSPECTORS IN JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHOSE JOB IT IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH AND SAFETY IN DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS PROVIDING THE IDEAL NUTRIENTS FOR BACTERIA TO GROW AS A RESULT ACCORDING TO THE CASE THE CDC. THE NUMBER OF. SICKNESS IS BEING REPORTED EACH YEAR AS A RESULT OF MICRO ORGANISMS IN OUR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS NOW APPROACHES NEARLY THIRTY TWO MILLION. PARTICULARLY OF CONCERN IS THE DRAMATIC RISE IN THE CASES OF LEGIONELLA THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED SINCE TWO THOUSAND. IN THE LAST YEAR AVAILABLE THAT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S REPORTED OVER TEN THOUSAND CASES OF LEGIONELLA IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE BUT 10% OF VICTIMS WHO FALL ILL WITH LEGIONELLA ACTUALLY DYING. JUST LAST WEEK WE HAD A LEGIONELLA OUTBREAK AT A HOTEL IN HAWAII. SB ELEVEN FORTY FOUR ATTEMPTS TO GET- THE STATE'S ARMS AROUND THIS. BY THIS PROBLEM BY A MODEST BUT TESTING OF OUR WATER SYSTEM AND REQUIRING THE BUILDING OWNERS PUT TOGETHER A MANAGEMENT PLAN TO ADDRESS ANY- PROBLEMS WITH LEAD IN PIPE OR WITH OTHER MICROORGANISMS- WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER WAX NECKS BAKER. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PLUMBING AND MECHANICAL OFFICIALS OR AT I AM ALL I AM WITH THE PUBLISHER OF THE- MODEL OP TIMING CODE THAT CALIFORNIA PLUMBING CODE IS BASED ON AND ALSO HAS. WATER QUALITY- DIVISIONS AS WELL. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL I JUST LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE- ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON IT ONE ON THE EFFICIENCY ISSUE- THERE WAS LEGISLATION A NUMBER YEARS AGO THAT REQUIRED COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS TO UPDATE UPDATE AND REPLACE OLD INEFFICIENT PLUMBING FIXTURES. BUT IT DIDN'T APPLY TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND STATE BUILDINGS- REPLACING THESE INEFFICIENT PICTURES WOULD SAVE BILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER A YEAR AS WELL AS- REPLACE OLDER PICTURES THAT HAVE A HIGHER MY CONTENT. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD. REQUIRE SCHOOLS AND STATE BUILDINGS TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THEY HAVE AN EFFICIENT FIXTURES TO REPLACE IT IF FUNDING IS AVAILABLE AND WE DO KNOW FUNDING IS AVAILABLE SUCH AS AB EIGHT FORTY ONE CALLOUS A PLUMBING PROGRAM INCENTIVES THE LEGISLATURE PASSED. A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND THE NEW FEDERAL OF BUILDING BETTER SCHOOL. INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM THAT'S COMING DOWN THE LINE. THE ALSO REQUIRES A CERTAIN WATER POLO AND- AS A I MISS WEST DISK THIS IS A RELEASE WITH. RATE ON WE- LEGION IS LEADING CAUSE OF- OF SICKNESS AND BUILDINGS. ARE THIS WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THESE ISSUES TO REMEDIATE THEM WITHIN A YEAR OR TO HAVE A MANAGEMENT PLAN IF YOU CAN'T REMEDIATE INTERMEDIATE IT WITHIN A YEAR. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE COOLING TOWERS HAVE LEGIONELLA MANAGEMENT PLAN IN PLACE WHICH IS THE INDUSTRY. MOST BUILDINGS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT YOU KNOW THE GENERAL INDUSTRY STANDARD. AND THEN FINALLY MYERS- NO SCHOOLS TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW THOSE THAT IF THEY DO HAVE WATER QUALITY THAT AT RISK FOR STUDENTS OR STATE- WORKERS THAT THEY ARE PROVIDE NOTICE OF IT AND WE THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUFF GOOD STUFF I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. EXPECT HER. MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS MIKE WEST ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I CAN JUST WEST.

TO THE SCHOOL AND- ALONG THE- THE PIPES AND SO ON I'M JUST THINKING IS IT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT- REPAIRING ALL THE WATER FOUNTAINS WITH NEW PIPING AND SO ON ARE WE LOOKING AT RETYPING THE PARTICULAR SCHOOL FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER CENTER WHAT WHAT DID YOU FIND IN ON THAT YEAH I SURE CAN ANSWER THAT IF MR WATCH THANK YOU NOT ONLY CAN THE ON THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE WATER FOUNTAIN ITSELF I MEAN IT'S ABOUT- THE ENTIRE PLUMBING SYSTEM POTENTIALLY- EVALUATING IT BECAUSE EVEN IF THE- EVEN IF THE WATER FOUND ITSELF IS OKAY THERE MIGHT BE A DEEPER.

SB TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE LEE SAYS THAT IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIANS AND YOU HAVE BILLS TO PAY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT YOU CAN NOTE THAT YOU MUST BUT THAT YOU CAN USE VIRTUAL CURRENCY TO DO SO IF THE STATE AGENCY WILL ALLOW IT. SB TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE IS A PERMISSIVE BILL THAT WOULD NOT REQUIRE A STATE AGENCY TO ACCEPT VIRTUAL. WHAT IT WOULD DO IS PUT CALIFORNIA IN THE GAME ON AN ISSUE WHERE WE HAVE BEEN SORELY LACKING. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIRTY THREE STATES AUTHORED LEGISLATION ON VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND HOW TO USE IT EXCEPT IT VALUE IT RECORD IT. AND REALLY JUST HOW TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT EXISTS. IN CALIFORNIA WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE STATES AND SO HERE WE ARE IN TWENTY TWO. VIRTUAL CURRENCY IS HERE TO STAY AND WHILE IT MAY NOT BE INGRAINED IN DAILY LIFE. OR UBIQUITOUS IN THE FINANCIAL ECOSYSTEM OR EVEN A PROMINENT PART F AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS ON TRACK TO BE ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND MORE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. WE SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY WE SHOULD BE EMBRACING IT. BECAUSE IT IS MONEY. IT IS JUST MONEY THAT IS STORED OR EXCHANGED USING COMPUTER SYSTEMS. THE ROLE OF PHYSICAL CASH IS DECLINING ACROSS THE GLOBE AS INSTITUTIONS ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AND VIRTUAL CURRENCY HAS ARRIVED AND INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES ARE ADOPTING IT. WHILE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS ARE GENERALLY WHITE MAN 44% OF BITCOIN AND CRYPTO INVESTORS ARE NON WHITE SURVEY SHOWS THAT 16% OF AMERICANS HAVE INVESTED IN DIGITAL CURRENCY AND ACCORDING TO DATA FROM HARRIS POLL GIVEN EXCLUSIVELY TO USA TODAY 23% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN SEVENTEEN PERCENT. OF HISPANIC AMERICANS OWN VIRTUAL ASSETS WHICH IS JUST ABOUT INVESTING NOT ABOUT PAYMENTS IT IS CLEAR THAT BANKING INSTITUTIONS ARE ALSO INVESTING A LOT OF THEIR RESEARCH RESEARCH RESOURCES AND RESEARCH REGARDING CRYPTOCURRENCY INTEGRATION IN THEIR OPERATIONS. VISA HAS STARTED A CRYPTO CONSULTING SERVICE AND INVESTED IN CRYPTO PLATFORMS AS PART OF A PUSH FOR DIGITAL CURRENCY ADOPTION APPLE PAY AND GOOGLE PAY MAKE IT EVEN EASIER TO SPEND VIRTUAL CURRENCY CHASE AND BANK OF AMERICA ARE INVESTING HEAVILY IN THIS SPACE IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED FOR THE WAVE OF TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE COMING. MANY OF WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY MISSING OUT ON. SB TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE ACCEPTANCE OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY MAKES SENSE FOR STATE AGENCIES FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT MAKES SENSE FOR BUSINESSES THE EASE OF PAYMENT BY THE CONSUMER. AND REDUCED COSTS OF PAYMENT PROCESSING BY THE SERVICE AGENCY. VIRTUAL CURRENCY CAN BE USED AS A TOOL FOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE ONE THAT CAN HELP UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES INCREASE OUR ECONOMIC MOBILITY BY BUILDING GENERATIONAL WEALTH. ACCORDING TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH NETWORK UNBANKED AND UNDERBANKED AMERICANS SPEND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEES AND INTEREST ON FINANCIAL PRODUCTS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LATEST YEAR FOR WHICH THERE IS COMPLETE DATA. USING THE FDIC'S ESTIMATE THAT SOME SIXTY THREE MILLION AMERICANS ARE UNBANKED OR UNDERBANKED THAT WOULD BE AN AVERAGE OF THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ANNUAL COSTS PER PERSON THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BEAR. MANY PEOPLE HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY AND HACKING AND BAD ACTORS AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME OF THAT. IN MY OPENING HEY THERE ARE CONCERNS CONCERN SECURITY CONCERNS HACKING AND BAD ACTORS IN THE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL LENDING SPACES RIGHT NOW. B. THIS BILL WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE STATE TO START ACCEPTING VIRTUAL CURRENCY IN FACT IF THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN ACCEPTING PAYMENTS COULD CONDUCT THEIR OWN STUDY. AND MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT IF THEY'RE WILLING OR ABLE TO ACCEPT IT. AND SEE. ANY BILL THAT DEALS WITH CURRENCY SHOULD MAKE SURE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE THAT SAFEGUARDS AGAINST MALICIOUS ACTORS AND THERE ARE VIABLE SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE AS WELL AS SOLUTIONS FOR USER PRIVACY. MY HOPE IS THAT THIS WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE SO THAT THOSE DETAILS AND GUARDRAILS COULD BE FLESHED OUT ARE STATE LEVEL STUDIES HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AS WELL AS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THAT ASKS FOR A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. THE STUDY AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE. IN THAT REPORT IS SCHEDULED TO BE FINISHED AND RELEASED IN SEPTEMBER SO LOTS OF OUR EYES ARE ON THIS ISSUE. AND SB TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE WOULD JUST ALLOW A LAUNCH PAD FOR WHEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS READY. WITH ME IN SUPPORT TODAY IS ALLEY MEDINA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BLOCKCHAIN ADVOCACY COALITION AND MICHELLE NEEDS FROM BLOCKCHAIN LAW AND SOCIAL GOOD CENTER- WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I THINK I'M ALSO SUPPOSED TO MENTION THAT. MY TWO WITNESSES ARE IN THE GENERAL Q. RATHER-THAN THE DEDICATED LINE. AND SO THEY MAY HAVE TO BE CALLED OUT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER COM AUGER I WILL NOW MOVES ON TO ANYONE WAITING. WANTING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT- SO LET'S MOVE THERE'S NOBODY IN THE CHAMBERS LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA THE TELECONFERENCE OR. AND IF SO YOU CAN PRESS ONE ZERO WE CAN OPEN YOUR LINE. DISBARMENT HERE. ILLEGAL LINE FIFTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MICHELLE NEEDS AND I AM A LAW PROFESSOR AT GOLDEN GATE UNIVERSITY I AM ALSO THE FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF THE BLOCKCHAIN LOT FOR SOCIAL GOOD CENTER AND I WAS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA BLOCKCHAIN WORKING GROUP IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. OUT WE'RE HERE BECAUSE BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THE CRYPTO CURRENCY IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT THE BILL IS INTRIGUING BECAUSE IT RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT CALIFORNIA COULD BE INVOLVED WITH THE USE OF CRYPTO CURRENCIES AS A WAY TO FOSTER FINANCIAL INCLUSION. SO WE WOULD ADVOCATE FOR A BALANCED AND RESEARCH APPROACH TO THE ISSUE A CRYPTOCURRENCY VIEWED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS OUTLINED IN THE CALIFORNIA BLOCKCHAIN WORKING GROUP REPORT THAT WAS PUBLISHED. IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY- YOU KNOW THAT'S IN THE IN. FINDERS IN IN NUMEROUS. AROUND THE WORLD FOCUS ON FINANCIAL. AND WE NEED TO DEVELOP A BETTER PATH TOWARDS FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN CALIFORNIA. WELL WHERE THERE ARE SUCH HIGH NUMBERS OF UNBANKED AND UNDERBANKED POPULATIONS ESPECIALLY AMONG COMMUNITY AS A COLOR. CURRENTLY IN A- COULD PLAY A ROLE IN THIS EFFORT TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL SERVICES TO TRADITIONALLY DISENFRANCHISED POPULATION. AND GOVERNMENT PAYMENTS AND RECEIPT OF PAYMENT WOULD BE A STEP FORWARD. SO WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE MANY ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED. FIRST THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY AND CYBERSECURITY ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AVOID UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHILE IT IS ENSURING THAT INNOVATION AND PUBLIC PROTECTION ARE WELL BALANCED. WE ALSO SHOULD MAKE SURE TO BE CAREFUL IN OUR SELECTION OF A BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATION TO RECEIVE AN ADMINISTER CRYPTO PAYMENT. BECAUSE IT MUST BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ADAPT TO THE FLUCTUATIONS. HAPPENING IN THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY. LASTLY WE HOPE THAT LED TO WOULD CONSIDER USING AN APPLICATION THE FIFTY AND WITH CALIFORNIA'S STATED VALUES FROM THE BLOCKCHAIN WORKING GROUP REPORT. THESE INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND ISSUES OF FAIRNESS AND EQUITY WHEN SELECTING APPLICATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT IN THE LINE FIFTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AND I'M GUESSING THAT YOU KNOW THE DIRECTOR BLOCKCHAIN OUT OF THE COALITION SPEAKING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO R.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATE HAVING HEARD FROM ALL THE SUPPORTERS WILL NOW FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM ANY OPPOSITION. I BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN TRIP- FOR THE CALIFORNIA. STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE HERE IN THE CHAMBER TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SIR PLEASE BEGIN. GIVE ME A GET THE MIKE UP TOP PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY MY NAME'S BEEN TRIP BOTH THE OFFICES THE CONTROLLER BETTY YEE CONTROLLER YOU RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES SB TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH ALLOWS THE AGENCIES TO ACCEPT CRYPTOCURRENCY IS A FORM OF PAYMENT. AS CALIFORNIA'S CHIEF FISCAL OFFICER CONTROL HE BELIEVES IT WOULD BE FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE THE STATE TO VENTURE INTO THE CRYPTOCURRENCY SPACE AT THIS TIME SEOS PRIMARY CONCERN CENTERS ON OUR OFFICES CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PRODUCE TIMELY AND ACCURATE YEAR END FINANCIAL REPORTS IN BOTH THE BUDGETARY LEGAL BASIS IN A FORMAT CONSISTENT WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. CALIFORNIA WAS ELEVEN MONTHLY PUBLISHING THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY YOU KNOW COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL REPORT. WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE A CLEAN AUDIT IN THE SHOULD NOT BE REPEATED. PERSONALLY YEAR END REPORTING FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS CURRENTLY TRACKING WORSE THAN LAST YEAR SIXTEEN AGENCIES AND A HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE FUNDS STILL DELINQUENT IN REPORTING THEIR BUDGETARY LEGAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WELL AS HE WAS WORKING WITH THESE DEPARTMENTS INTRODUCING DIGITAL CURRENCIES A METHOD OF PAYMENT FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICES BILL TIME AND NOT PRUDENT. GIVEN THE NEWNESS OF CRYPTO CURRENCIES PREVAILING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WERE ESTABLISHED A TIME TO DIGITAL CURRENCIES WERE NOT YET CONTEMPLATED. CALIFORNIA HAVE WOULD HAVE CRYPTO CURRENCIES ON ITS LEDGER STATE AGENCIES WOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IT WOULD NEED TO APPLY ARCANE CAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO NEW TECHNOLOGY. MOREOVER BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME FLUCTUATIONS IN CRYPTOCURRENCY VALUE THERE ON DOWN TO BE DISCREPANCIES INHERENT WITH RECONCILIATIONS MEETING THE FINANCIAL REPORTS FOR THE SCO. FOR FEAR FOR YEAR END FINANCIAL PARTS. IF RESPONSIBLY REGULATED FOR CONSUMERS PROTECTIONS CALIFORNIA MAIN BRACE THE USE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY HOWEVER IT MUST BE DONE IN A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER TO ENSURE ABILITY TO ACCURATELY MEASURE AND ACCOUNT FOR PERFORMANCE. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED HAVE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF THE CHAMBER- MODERATOR COULD YOU PLEASE PROP INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE PLEASE. THANK YOU INTO A OPPOSE SB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE YOU CAN PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AGAIN IT'S ONE ZERO. AND GIVE US JUST A MOMENT HERE. AND WE GO TO LINE SIXTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. DANIEL GUTIERREZ ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND WE LOOK FOR TO THINK ANY CHANGES ARE MADE THE BILL BUT WE- WERE. AND CURRENTLY NONE FURTHER IN Q. OKAY THANK YOU TO ALL OUR SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS. ANYBODY WISHING TO. YES THIS CENTER BACKER. YES A TWENTIETH OF PERSONAL THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER WORK ON THIS AT MEASURE- AND- DO YOU TAKE THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE- COMMENTS IS SERIOUSLY I DID YOU WANT TO ASK YOU KNOW IF YOU'D BE WILLING TO DESERT AT POSSIBLE DOING SOME KIND OF PILOT. OR SOMETHING THAT- MIGHT ALLOW TO TEST THIS OUT WITHOUT- REQUIRED A LOT OF WORK ON A LARGER SCALE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- ABSOLUTELY INTERESTED IN. A PILOT- INTERESTED IN ENGAGING WITH DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES ARE MOST INTERESTED IN VENTURING INTO THIS SPACE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE DEALS MOSTLY WITH PAYROLL AND SO THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY ANYTHING THAT WOULD COME TO THAT PARTICULAR OFFICE AND I KNOW THERE BEEN MANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT VOLATILITY AND FLUCTUATION SO ALSO INTERESTED IN PRESENTING MORE GUARD RAILS. SO THAT THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY ACCEPT THE CRYPTOCURRENCY AND THAT FORM BUT COULD ACCEPT IT AS IT IS CONVERTED INTO CASH. WHICH WILL STOP THE VOLATILITY IN ISSUES AND CONCERNS AROUND FLUCTUATION- SO THE SHORT ANSWER AGAINST THE LONG ANSWER IS YES. THANK YOU ARE BE WILLING TO HELP SUPPORT IN THE INTEREST OF CONTINUED ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS. SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I ALSO ENJOYED THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR ADVANCING THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION WE SEE- HOW NEW INNOVATIONS AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND- MONEY ARE HAPPENING AROUND THE GLOBE- THE CONTROLLER WAS VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT SHE SAW WITH- WITH ALLOWING THIS IN OUR STATE IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL REPORTS THAT. THAT OFFICE IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AND THE PROBLEMS THAT SHE'S HAD- JUST IN THE LAST FEW YEARS OF SOLVING THE AUTHOR COULD SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE WITH THE FINANCIAL REPORTS THAT COULD BE IN JEOPARDY- WITHOUT EITHER OF YOU KNOW THE CARE THAT I KNOW WE ALL WOULD WANT INDICT VANCE IN THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM AND HAD A SECOND FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS IS NOT HAPPENING TODAY AND IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN TOMORROW AND I THINK MANY OF- THE STATEMENTS AND COMMENTS BOTH IN THE LETTER OF OPPOSITION IN THE STATEMENTS TODAY TALK ABOUT THE REPORTS THAT THE BACK LOGGED ON NOW MY EXPECTATION AND EVEN THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THIS ISN'T ANYTHING THAT WOULD HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY I ALSO BELIEVE AS I SIT IN CHAIR BUDGET SUB THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN A BUDGET INCREASE TO HELP THEM WITH THIS KIND OF BACKLOG AND- I THINK THAT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT- IT DOES. AND THIS YOU KNOW MOVING SOMETHING FORWARD ALLOWS FOR THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS TO BE RAISED AND TO BE TACKLED. I'M USING- THE REPORTS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THE BLOCKCHAIN WORKING GROUP USING HOPEFULLY THE STUDY THAT WILL COME FROM THE FBI- IN A FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION AND HOPEFULLY EVEN USING THE GUIDANCE THAT WOULD COME FROM- THE WHITE HOUSE. THE SECOND QUESTION WAS THERE AT THE ANALYSIS AND THANK YOU TO THE STAFF FOR WRITING A TERRIFIC ANALYSIS ON THE BILL- RAISES THE AYE CONCERNED IT INDICATES AT LEAST THAT IT THIS ONE STATE HAD ADOPTED THIS OHIO- AND THEN- QUICKLY REVERSED COURSE. ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY OTHER STATE THAT'S ALLOWING THIS TYPE OF. ACTION TO TAKE PLACE YES SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE- THE ISSUE WITH THE OHIO IT REVERSED COURSE BECAUSE THERE WAS THAT A CHANGE- IN THE PERSON IN THE POSITION YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY- TO MOVE THAT KIND OF FORWARD THAT- THIS ISSUE FORWARD AT. A PARTY CHANGE AS WELL AS AN IDEOLOGICAL CHANGE- BUT THERE AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING THEIR THIRTY SEVEN STATES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS WYOMING. NEW YORK. ARIZONA OKLAHOMA COLORADO- MANY OF THEM ARE EITHER. ALLOWING YOU TO ACTUALLY PAY YOUR TAXES WHAT DID VIRTUAL CURRENCY ALLOWING YOU TO PURCHASE A LOTTERY TICKETS ALLOWING YOU TO PAY FOR REGISTRATION FEES- YOU KNOW ALLOWING YOU TO RECORD YOUR INVESTMENTS AND SO THERE ARE DOZENS OF- STATES. THAT HAVE INTRODUCED- LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION. IN MY IN MY- MY TIME- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- NOT ALWAYS LIKE CALIFORNIA TO BE AND- THE INNOVATION STATE AND TO- IT'LL BE A LEADER AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES CONCERNED THAT- THAT WE MAY BE GOING A LITTLE TOO FAST AND- I WOULD LIKE TO. SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE STUDY DONE AND MORE- CALIBRATED. SMALL BABY STEPS INTO THE SPACE- VERSUS THE BROADER- AUTHORIZATION THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED IN THE BILL AND SO I AND- I AM IN A LAYOFF THE BILL TODAY AND HOPE THAT- IF THE BILL DOES MOVE FORWARD IT- IT WEEK. IT CAN BE NARROWED TO A PLACE OF A MORE THOUGHTFUL STUDY AND CARE. ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO ADDRESS THE BODY ON THIS. OKAY CENTER CAMARGO I BELIEVE THE BILL'S PREMATURE IT COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS FOR BOTH THE STATE AND THOSE SEEKING TO USE THIS TYPE OF CURRENCY WE MUST MAKE SURE THE APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS ARE IN PLACE AND ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS ARE INFORMATION IS WELL PROTECTED YOU HAVE BEEN DOLLARS YOURSELF ABOUT THE STATE STUDY THAT'S COMING THE FEDERAL STUDY THIS COMING- I BELIEVE WE SHOULD WAIT AND SEE WHAT THOSE STUDIES. PRODUCED BEFORE WE MOVE DOWN THAT ROAD WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE I WAS- ON THE PHONE WITH SENATOR COM AUGER THIS MORNING PRIOR TO THAT THE TODAY SHOW REPORTED THIS MORNING THE CRYPTO CURRENCY IS THE SECOND LEADING FRAUDULENT AREA IN FINANCE IN THE COUNTRY TODAY. THAT IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME IS WILL WELL I HOPE THAT YOU WOULD AGREE TO A WORKING GROUP TO STUDY THIS ISSUE AND ALLOW MORE TIME TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU'RE OPEN TO THAT SUGGESTION SO ODD UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL AS IS SENATOR COM AUGER WHICH I DO CLOSE. YES THANK. YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I AM. WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE AND I'M OPEN TO A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING IT THIS IS A PERMISSIVE BILL AND SO THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT OR MANDATE. THAT ALL AGENCIES HAVE TO START IMMEDIATELY ACCEPTING DIGITAL CURRENCY AS PAYMENT- THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INVESTING IN DIGITAL CURRENCY WHICH I THINK WHERE MOST OF THE DISCUSSION LINES. AND THEN ACTUALLY USING DIGITAL CURRENCY TO PAY FOR SOMETHING- THERE'S ALSO A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCEPTING DIGITAL CURRENCY IN ITS FORM RIGHT AND IT'S DIGITAL FORM. AS OPPOSED TO WORKING WITH THIRD PARTY VENDORS TO CONVERT IT INTO CASH WE ACTUALLY THERE IS A AS A BANK HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THAT ACCEPTS DIGITAL CURRENCY AND SO THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. IN CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE AND THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS AS I MENTIONED TO CREATE A LAUNCHING PAD FOR THE STATE TO BEGIN TO. INCREMENTALLY OR NOT MOVE INTO THIS SPACE AS WELL I WANT TO ALSO ADD THAT THE UNITED STATES IS TIED FOR TENTH PLACE IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF HOW MANY OF OUR CITIZENS ARE RESIDENTS. OWN AND USE DIGITAL CURRENCY- THE PEOPLE BEEN TALKING ABOUT RISK YOU KNOW THE INTERNET IS RISKY PEOPLE WERE SCARED ABOUT INVESTING IN INTERNET STOCKS IN THE NINETIES AND THEN LOOK WHAT HAPPENED- AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT SUGGESTING. THAT WE DON'T TAKE ANY OF THOSE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION IN FACT WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS WHY DON'T WE USE THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT THAT ARE IN PROCESS NOW TO HELP GUIDE HOW WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP GUARD RAILS. AND YET ALLOW FOR THE FLEXIBILITY THAT CAN ENCOURAGE THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS PERHAPS MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE DIGITAL CURRENCY AND WOULD LIKE THAT TO PAY FOR A STATE PROVISION. IN A WAY THAT IS SAFE IN A WAY THAT IS SECURE AND IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT EEP BILL. PUSH THE LIABILITY OF VOLATILITY ON TO THE STATE THERE ARE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND THIS BILL IS JUST ASKING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE PART OF DISCUSSING- THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A NO VOTE COMING FROM THE CHAIR AND IF THIS WERE TO FAIL I AM WOULD CERTAINLY ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION.
