AND HOPEFULLY WE GET FIFTY BUT IF WE DON'T WE YOU KNOW WE CAN WORK ON EVERY YEAR HAVING AN ALLOCATION TO HELP.

AGAIN I WANT TO WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- ASSEMBLY WOMAN AYE LOUISE RAY AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON -- TO TO THE HEARING AND THAT THIS POINT IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO START WITH PLEASE -- GO AHEAD AND DECIDE THIS TIME. THE MADAM CHAIR -- I THINK THIS SELECT COMMITTEE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND YOU'RE RIGHT YOU YOU'VE HAD SOME PARTNERS BACK IN THE COMMUNITY -- ON THE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WELL ONE OF THOSE PARTNERS IS NOW SITTING IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT'S YOUR SISTER CENTER -- SUSAN RUBIO. AND THAT'S IT. I THINK IT IT TELLS US THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A TOPIC THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO DO SO MUCH MORE -- THE TOPIC OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. OFTENTIMES IS A VERY PAINFUL ONE TO DISCUSS AND SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE. TO HAVE THESE CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE SO NECESSARY. I AM DEEPLY DISTURBED BY THE PREVAILING SO VIOLENCE AGAINST YOUNG GIRLS AND WOMEN IN THE STATE. AND I'M COMMITTED. TO WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMUTE THIS COMMITTEE TO BRING CLARITY IN ACTION TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT CULTURE. EARLIER THIS YEAR I WAS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THE DURING A PERIOD OF ALMOST THREE DECADES. MORE THAN FOURTEEN THOUSAND YOUNG WOMEN. HAD BEEN SEXUALLY EXPLOITED -- SEXUALLY. EXPLOITED I'M GOING TO USE THAT WORD. BY DOCTOR TENDO A LONG TIME GYNECOLOGIST AT U. S. C. WHO IS THERE FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. HE HARASSED ALL THESE WOMEN BUT HE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED WOMEN OF COLOR. AND IMMIGRANT WOMEN. THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. THEY WERE IN FACT THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. I'VE INTRODUCED AB FIFTEEN TAN IN RESPONSE TO THIS MY HOPE TO REOPEN THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. THAT IS ALREADY EXPIRED AND THEN TO ALLOW THE SURVIVORS TO SUBMIT THEIR CLAIM TO COURT IF THEY SO CHOOSE. IT'S THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY REALITY THAT I HAVE TO AUTHORS SUCH A BILL A WE SHOULD BE BEYOND ALL OF THIS -- BUT IT WAS NECESSARY LEGISLATION IN MY OPINION BECAUSE THE ACTS THAT OCCURRED OCCURRED OVER SUCH A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. WE KNOW THE PREVENTION IS CRITICAL. TO STOPPING THESE EGREGIOUS ACTS AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND MAKING SURE THAT THE BUDGET REFLECTS OUR OUR VALUES. AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU YOU JOIN WITH THOSE WHO ARE REQUESTING THAT THE BUDGET REFLECT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE ENOUGH. AND I'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE SAID THIS MANY TIMES BUT TO BE SURE THAT THE THE THE THE THE REQUEST IS MADE I DO LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THIS SEC SELECT COMMITTEE. AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONVENING IT TODAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS SELECT COMMITTEE ON THIS A VERY IMPORTANT. AREA A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION AND THESE TYPES OF THINGS HAPPEN ACROSS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS ALL ETHNICITIES AND AND AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND AND TAKE A STAND TO SHOW THAT THOSE THAT. HAVE. BEEN THROUGH THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS KNOW THAT WE ARE IN SUPPORT AND TRYING TO GET ON RESOURCES TO TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A LIFE AND HOLDING THOSE THAT PERPETRATED IT. AGAINST THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS ALSO. AND MANAGER I WALKED IN WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION WE JUST MOVED ON THE FLOOR -- FOR MAKING MAY -- AWARENESS FOR MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS SO WOMEN -- IN THE NATION BUT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S A HIGH POPULATION -- AND IT'S NUMBER SIX ON THE LIST SO THIS IS VERY -- TIMELY AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES IN HEARING FROM THOSE THAT ARE HERE TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUE TO FORMULATE LEGISLATION -- IN THE FUTURE SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS AND THANK YOU FOR ASSEMBLY IN THE SELECT COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING TO YOU -- EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU -- I WANT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL TO OUR OUR CHAIRWOMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS IMPORTANT. AND MUCH NECESSARY I'M CONVERSATION ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION -- LIKE MY COLLEAGUES WHO ALREADY SAID WE AYE ECHO -- THE COMMENTS THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE -- IN OUR COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA -- I JUST RE WAS REFLECTING ON SO MY TIME WHEN I WAS A POLICE OFFICER IN THE CITY OF MAY WOOD. AND GOING TO A HOME WHERE A HUSBAND JAZZ VIOLATED HIS WIFE AND OT PHYSICAL AND HOW ANGRY I BECAME AS A RESULT OF OF THAT SITUATION. AND SO WE REALIZE THAT WE MUST CHANGE -- THE TRAJECTORY AND PEOPLE'S MINDS THAT -- STARTING AT AN ADOLESCENT AGE THAT BULLYING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE -- BUT ALSO TO LET -- THOSE HERE KNOW THAT -- WILL -- THOSE WHO ARE VICTIMS ARE NOT JUST WOMEN MEN ALSO OUR VICTIM AND ALSO SHOULD HAVE THEIR PLACE IN THE CONVERSATION -- BECAUSE SOMETIMES A LOT OF VIOLENCE WITH THAT MEN SUFFER GOES UNREPORTED BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA YOU POST BE A MAN SUCK IT UP YOU KNOW AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND SO WE MUST REMEMBER THAT MAN ALSO ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- AS WELL AND SO I'M HAPPY WANT TO SEE -- ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT I REPRESENTS -- BELIEVES THE CITY IN WHICH I REPRESENT LONG BEACH LGBT US CENTER OF LONG BEACH IS IS HERE IN REPRESENTATIVE ADD THEIR VOICES -- WITH ALL THAT WHO WILL COME AND TESTIFY SO I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THEIR ROBUST CONVERSATION AS WE MOVE FOR SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I'M YES -- THANK YOU -- FOR FOR BEING HERE BUT ALSO I DID WANT -- TO TALK ABOUT SENATOR SUSAN RUBIO WHO'S BEST SAID IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW -- AND AS A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHE'S DOING SOME WORK ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I DON'T WANT TO FEEL -- HEARD THUNDER -- BECAUSE SHE IS VERY OBVIOUSLY MORE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE ISSUE AND SHE'S GOT A PIECE OF A COUPLE PIECES OF LEGISLATION. ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I AND THE NEXT -- HOPEFULLY THE NEXT HEARING WE WE CAN HEAR FROM HER AND HOW THE LEGISLATION IS GOING -- BUT I'VE ALSO PARTNERED WITH SENATOR BAIL -- DO AS WE DID LAST YEAR TO TO REQUEST A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR SIX DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT THE SENATORS HASN'T SENATOR SUSAN RUBIO HAS HAD -- IS ABOUT THE PREVENTION AND ABOUT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS -- SHE AND I HAD -- ANY DENT IN OUR DISTRICT -- FOR YOUNG WOMEN AND WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT -- HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP WITH THE YOUNG FOLKS WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THAT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS THEY NECESSARILY MEAN TO ME TO BE ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS. BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT THEM AS THE VIOLENCE IN TERMS OF OF A ROMANTIC PARTNERS -- THE SPOUSES AND GIRLFRIENDS AND BOYFRIENDS BUT THE REALITY IS AND THE THE YOUNG WOMEN POINTED THAT OUT IS THAT THEY THOUGHT. THE SAME THING BUT WHEN WE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THEM WE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. A ROMANTIC PARTNER YOU CAN BE -- VIOLATED OUR BULLIED BY BY FRIENDS AND THAT'S HOW THE CYCLE OF THE OF DOMESTIC OF YOU'D BE STARTS IF YOU ALLOW OTHER PEOPLE. TO TO TO BULLY YOU VIOLATE YOU -- EVEN IF IT'S NOT ROMANTICALLY THEN WHEN YOU GET INTO A RELATIONSHIP A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP YOU DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AND YOU ASSUME THAT THAT'S ALSO. OKAY EVEN IF YOUR GUT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S NOT OKAY AND SO IS VERY -- EYE OPENING FOR ME BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN TERMS OF ROMANTIC PARTNERS -- BY THE CYCLE STARTS WITH OTHER RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE NOT HEALTHY AND SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE -- AND I WANT. TO BRING UP OUR NEXT PANEL AND AGAIN I THINK THE PANEL MEMBERS WILL BRING YOU UP -- WILL HAVE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR OF DISCUSSION -- AND THEN A QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE FROM THE COMMITTEE AND POSSIBLY FROM THE PUBLIC AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE THE FOLLOWING PANEL OUR GOAL IS TO BE OUT HERE BY -- ELEVEN THIRTY AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP TO THAT TIME JUST SO THAT WE CAN BE A THIS F.

TO TO THE DíAS PLEASE AND THEN -- SERWIS ALL OF AN EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM COORDINATOR -- CATALYST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES IN CHICO AND MELODY. OF COURSE BY THE END OF PREVENTION AND POLICY DIVISION DIRECTOR PEACE OVER VIOLENCE IN LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU WELCOME AND THERE'S SOME -- NAME PLATES IF YOU WOULD LIKE. TO AB RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU JUST SAW THAT TO A WE KNOW. WHO WE ARE DRESSING THANK YOU THANK [inaudible] THANK YOU -- IF WE CAN START THE CONVERSATION AUDREY -- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START OKAY THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS AUDREY DAVIS AND I THANK YOU. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND SPEAK ABOUT PREVENTION WORK WITH YOUTH. I ENJOY WORKING WITH YOUTH AND MY ROLE AS A PROGRAM COORDINATOR FOR ETHOS YOUTH CENTER. WHICH IS LOCATED IN MARIPOSA CALIFORNIA. WERE PART OF A LARGER ORGANIZATION THE ALLIANCE FOR COMMUNITY TRANSFORMATIONS. WHICH ALSO HAS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT PROGRAMS IN MARIPOSA AND MERCED. THOUGH OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SMALL AND RURAL VIOLENCE STILL HAPPENS IN OUR HOMES AND IN OUR SCHOOLS. OUR ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN DOING PREVENTION WORK AND MAYOR POSTS AND MERCED FOR MANY YEARS AND IT'S HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING IN OUR PROGRAMS FOR OVER FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE CHANGES IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THREE EVALUATING SOME OF OUR EFFORTS I HAVE DOCUMENTED INCREASES IN KNOWLEDGE MESSAGING AWARENESS AND EDUCATION. HAVE WE A RADIC HATED VIOLENCE ALL TOGETHER. NO. BUT HAVE WE HELP THE COMMUNITY TO LEARN TO RECOGNIZE SEXUAL VIOLENCE I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY YES. A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THECOMMUNITY IT RESPONDING APPROPRIATELY IT TO INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR. TWO YEARS AGO THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED OR CHALKED UP TO JUST SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS. BUT WITH MORE EDUCATION AND AWARENESS ABOUT WHAT SEXUAL ASSAULT IS. THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE SPEAKING OUT AND REACTING TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. THE WAYS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH FAMILIES AND WITHIN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS HELPED TO CREATE CHANGES SUCH AS ADVOCATING FOR INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGING SCHOOL POLICY CHANGES. SO I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT SOME OF THE LARGER PREVENTION EFFORTS THAT I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO BE A PART OF OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. WHEN I FIRST BEGAN DOING PREVENTION WORK AMONG CRISIS SERVICES IN MARIPOSA? WE WERE ONE YEAR INTO A FIVE YEAR GRANT FROM THE CDC IN THE GRANT HELPED US TO FOCUS ON A COMMUNITY LEVEL CHANGE. BY CREATING MESSAGING AROUND ADOLESCENT RELATIONSHIP ABUSE PREVENTION AND ENCOURAGING OUR COMMUNITY TO THINK OF SCHOOLS AS PLACES WHERE. HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS BEGAN. AND WE'RE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP SKILLS CAN BE TAUGHT AND TALKED ABOUT. IN ADDITION TO CREATING AND DISSEMINATING MESSAGING AROUND THIS ISSUE WE ALSO DEVELOP POLICY GUIDELINES FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT TO CONSIDER AS WELL AS SCHOOL SITE LEVEL CHANGES THAT COULD BE PRACTICES. TO PROMOTE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS SUCH AS ENCOURAGING SCHOOLS TO HIRE A COUNSELOR FOR EACH SCHOOL SITE PROVIDING TRAINING FOR ALL STAFF AND RECOGNIZING AND RESPONDING TO RELATIONSHIP ABUSE. WE WERE ABLE TO EVALUATE OUR EFFORTS AND MEASURE INCREASES IN OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. WE ARE ABLE TO MEASURE AN INCREASE AND MESSAGING ABOUT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS THAT WAS NOT ONLY COMING FROM US BUT FROM OTHERS WHO ARE SHARING OUR MESSAGES. THAT INCREASE HELPED US TO SEE THAT THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTED OUR MESSAGING IN THAT THEY BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR SCHOOLS TO TEACH AND TALK ABOUT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. THE LASTING IMPACTS OF THIS PROJECT HAVE. INCLUDED BETTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND BEYOND MORE YOU FLAT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS SUCH AS THE YEARLY PERFORMANCE EVENT. A YOUTH ACTION COMMITTEE AND A REGULAR MONTHLY COLUMN IN OUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER. THE YOUTH PERFORMANCE EVENTS STARTED AS A SPARSELY ATTENDED CHAU SPOKEN WORD POETRY THAT A FEW YOU THROW AND PERFORMED. AND THE IDEA FOR THAT EVENT WAS TO HEAR FROM YOU WITHIN THEIR OWN WORDS ABOUT THEIR IDEAS OF HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AND HOW ADULTS COULD SUPPORT THEM. IT GREW OVER THE YEARS AND FEATURED DIGITAL ART AND AUDIO DRAMAS ALL CREATED BY YOUTH AND CENTER ON THE IDEA OF HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. AND AFTER ABOUT THREE YEARS THE HIGH SCHOOL DECIDED TO CONVERT THE SHOW TO BE ONE OF THEIR REGULAR PERFORMANCES -- NOW THE SHOW'S CALLED YOUTH VOICES ROCK AND RIGHT AND STUDENTS RAPE SCENES INSPIRED BY MUSIC STUDENTS THAN DIRECT AND PERFORM THE SCENES AND YOUTH BANDS PERFORM THE SONGS. ALTHOUGH IT TOOK SOME TIME THE SHOW GREW FROM A FEW PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE TO BEING A SOLD OUT SHOW FOR FOR TWO NIGHTS. WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM THAT REACHES A LOT OF PEOPLE. OF THE READERSHIP OF OUR NEWSPAPERS AROUND A THOUSAND PEOPLE WHICH IS A LOT FOR HER SMALL COMMUNITY. AND WE HAVE THIS REGULAR COLUMN SO WE CAN SHARE OUR PROGRESS AND PREVENTION OTHER SUCCESSES FROM OUR PROGRAMS. OUR CURRENT PREVENTION WORK IS AIMED AT CREATING PROTECTIVE ENVIRONMENTS ONCE AGAIN WE'VE DECIDED TO FOCUS OUR WORK ON SCHOOLS AS PLACES FOR LEARNING SKILLS FRUITION SHIPS AND FOR CREATING POSITIVE SCHOOL COMMUNITIES AND CLIMATE. WERE IMPLEMENTING AN EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM CALLED SHIFTING BOUNDARIES WHICH NOT ONLY TEACHES MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS SKILLS FOR RESPECTING BOUNDARIES AND PERSONAL SPACE. AND HOW TO BECOME ADVOCATES FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY BUT IT ALSO GIVES STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THEIR SCHOOL SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT THROUGH A HOT SPOT MAPPING ACTIVITY IN. WE'VE EMPLOYMENT OF THIS PROGRAM IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND ARE PLANNING TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS OR MORE. THE OUTCOME SO FAR INCLUDE REACHING AROUND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. HELPING THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PERSONAL BOUNDARIES ARE ALL ABOUT. BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY NEEDED CHANGES THAT EACH SCHOOL STATE BASED ON STUDENT RESPONSES AND CONTINUING TO BUILD OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH LEADERS IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. SO THAT WE MAY CONTINUE TO SUPPORT POSITIVE CHANGES WITHIN THAT SYSTEM. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT I COULD SAY ABOUT THE POSITIVE IMPACTS OF PREVENTION OUR COMMUNITY WE HAVE A DROP IN CENTER OR YOUTH CAN GO AFTER SCHOOL TO BE SAFE PLAY GAMES LISTEN TO MUSIC DO ART PROJECTS AND TALK WITH ADULTS. AND THEIR PEERS ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY MAY BE FACING. WE TEACH A LIFE SKILLS CLASS OUR ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL ONCE A WEEK WHICH GIVES US ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT WITH YOUTH WHO HAD MANY CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR LIVES. WE MEET WEEKLY AT A GIRLS GROUP HOME AND DO ART WHICH HELPS THEM TO COPE WITH THE STRESS OF BEING AWAY FROM HOME AND THEIR FAMILY IS. THE WE'RE DOING IT SO MUCH PREVENTION WE'VE HAD HAD SUCCESS AND BEEN ABLE TO SEE CHANGE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. MORE FUNDING FOR PREVENTION IN OUR COMMUNITY WOULD ALLOW US TO CONTINUE THE WORK WE'RE DOING AN INCREASE OUR CAPACITY TO DO MORE. WE ONLY HAVE A FEW STAFF WORKING PRIMARILY ON PREVENTION AND THEY WORK HARD. LONG HOURS AND WEEKENDS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY NO. TO THINGS IN THIS FIELD BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO MISS ANY OPPORTUNITY IS SO WE END UP BEING SPREAD VERY THIN BUT BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT WORKS WE KEEP WORKING AT IT AND WHEN WE LEARN OF OUR SUCCESSES IT MAKES US WANT TO WORK HARDER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE TIME TO SPEAK TODAY AND TO SHARE SOME OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING. THANK YOU I'M BEFORE WE CONTINUE I JUST ONE AND YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU GOT A GRANT FROM CDC -- CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE AMOUNT OF THE GRANT IS. THE AMOUNT FOR OUR PROGRAM IS EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND WITH THE AND IT'S YEAH IT'S DISPERSED TO OUR PROGRAM AND ANOTHER PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA -- SO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF AND ALSO THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO THE TOTAL NUMBER IS LARGER THAN THAT BUT IT IS A FIVE YEAR GRANT SO WE HAVE A FULL TIME STAFF PERSON WORKING ON THAT GRANT AND THEN A COUPLE OF OTHER -- STAFF WHO WORK. A FEW HOURS ON THAT GRANT AS WELL [inaudible] BUT YEAH IT IS THROUGH THE CDC SO IT'S NOT CALIFORNIA STATE FUNDING AND IT'S AN AWESOME FUNDING SOURCE FOR US BUT IT'S YEAH NOT FROM. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT THIS POINT BECAUSE YEAH IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE ACCESSING -- MONIES YOU KNOW WE SEEM TO THINK THAT. WHY LEAST I DO THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO FIND IT BUT THE CDC? YOU KNOW IF WE CAN ACCESS SOME OF THOSE GRANTS THAT MIGHT HELP ME IN OAK DUPLICATOR PROGRAM IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A FANTASTIC PROGRAM. SO THANK YOU WE CAN YOU KNOW TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE AFTERWARD BY JUSTIN WAS INTERESTED IN THE AMOUNT YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THEN I HI. HOW MANY MISTER SOLOMON AND I AM THE EDUCATION OUT REACH PROGRAM COORDINATOR AT CATALYST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES IN BUTTE COUNTY? I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU I LIKE TO ESPECIALLY THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND COMMITTEE CHAIR BLANCA RUBIO FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE. TALKING ABOUT INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IS HARD. IT IS UNCOMFORTABLE AT TIMES SCARY TO THINK ABOUT OUR LOVED ONES BEING HARMED BY SOMEONE THEY LOVE AND TRUST. PREVENTION EFFORTS BRING A HISTORICALLY PRIVATE CONVERSATION TO THE PUBLIC EYE AND THAT CAN FEEL TABOO. BUT TALKING ABOUT IT OPENLY AND HONESTLY IS THE FIRST STEP TO PREVENTING IT FROM HAPPENING TO FUTURE GENERATIONS. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THESE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS AND FOR ADVOCATING FOR CHANGE. I HAVE WORK TO CATALYST MYSTIC VIOLENCE SERVICES FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS I AM AN ADVOCATE A COMMUNITY EDUCATOR AND A SUPERVISOR. THE MISSION OF CATALYST IS REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE THROUGH CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND THE PROMOTION OF HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULTS TO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT RED FLAGS OF ABUSE AND GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO ENGAGE IN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. BOTH ROMANTICALLY AND PLATONIC LAME. I WORK WITH MY TEAM TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE CURRICULUM BASED ON BEST PRACTICES TO ADDRESS THE MERE OUT OF ISSUES ARE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FACING TODAY WHEN TRYING TO NAVIGATE NEW RELATIONSHIPS. MANY OF THEM HAVE NEVER HAD HEALTHY COMMUNICATION MODEL THAT HOME AND STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO ENGAGE IN HEALTHY BEHAVIOR. I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT DURING THE 200-017-22000 EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR OUR TEAM REACH TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TO USE. WE FACILITATED TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PRESENTATIONS AND WE PARTICIPATED IN FIFTY TWO COMMUNITY EVENTS. WE KNOW THAT WITH MORE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS WOULD REACH EVEN MORE PEOPLE. SOMETIMES DIRECT SERVICE WORK CAN FEEL OVERWHELMING AND MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE HOPE LESS. WE KNOW THAT ONE IN THREE PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE IN A RELATIONSHIP AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIVES. THAT IS A STAGGERING NUMBER. WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT TAKES AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN TIMES TO LEAVE AN ABUSIVE PARTNER. BUT THERE IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. PREVENTION BRINGS HOPE TO THE CHALLENGING IN OFTENTIMES DEVASTATING WORK THAT WE DO EVERY DAY WITH VICTIMS. BY BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WE ARE ABLE TO ELIMINATE THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH EXPERIENCING ABUSE AND EMPOWER THEM TO BREAK THE INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLE OF ABUSE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WILL IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME BEFORE WE SEE A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE AND INSTANCES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND BUTTE COUNTY. HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE ALREADY SEEMS SUCCESS AND OUR WORK. WE SEE SUCCESS WHEN STUDENTS WERE WORK WE'RE WORKING WITH HAVE THAT LABEL MOMENT. WHEN WHAT WE'RE SAYING WITH THEM WHAT WE'RE SAYING REALLY CLICKS WITH THEM? WE SEE SUCCESS WHEN AFTER PRESENTING TO A HIGH SCHOOL CLASS WE RECEIVE A PHONE CALL FROM A TEACHER THAT A STUDENT WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH US ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND DEVELOP WAYS TO STAY SAFE. WE SIXTIES SUCCESS WHEN STUDENTS AFFIRM THEIR COMMITMENT TO HEALTHY COMMUNICATION BY SHARING THE FAIR ARGUMENT RULES WITH THEIR PARTNERS AND FAMILIES. FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT PREVENTION. ONE OF OUR PREVENTION EFFORTS I AM MOST PROUD OF IS OUR ANNUAL YOUTH EMPOWERED CONFERENCE. THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO EDUCATE INFLUENTIAL EIGHTH GRADERS AND YOU COUNTY ON WAYS TO BE ACTIVE BYSTANDERS IN SITUATIONS LIKE BOWLING DATING ABUSE SEXUAL ASSAULT HAZING AND DISCRIMINATION. AS THEY GET READY TO START HIGH SCHOOL. THE RISK FACTORS PROTECTED Và FACTORS AND LONG AND SHORT TERM CONSEQUENCES OF BULLYING AND TEEN DATING ABUSE ARE VERY SIMILAR. THIS CONFERENCE PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR EERS TO BE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE CREATE CONNECTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY AND COMMIT TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF BOTH BULLYING AND TEEN DATING ABUSE AND THEIR SCHOOLS. THIS YEAR WE HAD STUDENTS FROM LAST YEAR'S CONFERENCE COME BACK AS PURE FACILITATORS THIS PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUTH LEADERSHIP AND PEER TO PEER PROGRAMMING. BYSTANDER INTERVENTION IS A REALISTIC AND REASONABLE APPROACH PREVENTION. WHILE PREVENTING ALL ACTS OF SEXUAL ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FROM EVER OCCURRING CAN SOMETIMES FEEL OUT OF REACH CREATING ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HARM OTHERS DO NOT BELIEVE THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. IS ATTAINABLE. CHOOSING A STEP IN CAN AFFECT HOW OTHERS AROUND US THINK ABOUT AND RESPOND TO HARMFUL BEHAVIORS. THAT'S WHY WE WORK WITH SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND ASK THEM TO NOMINATE STUDENTS FOR THIS CONFERENCE WERE SEEN AS LEADERS AMONG THEIR PEERS STUDENTS WHOSE VOICES ARE RESPECTED. WE GET THE STUDENTS IN A ROOM TOGETHER AND WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROTECTION SAFETY OF THEIR PEERS USE THEIR VOICES FOR POSITIVE CHANGE AN ACT AS ROLE MODELS. AT FIRST WHEN STUDENTS ARRIVE AT THE CONFERENCE THEY'RE A LITTLE GUARDED AND MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE SKEPTICAL. BUT ONCE WE'VE GOTTEN THEM TO TAKE OFF THEIR COOL JACKETS THE TRANSFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS REMARKABLE. STUDENTS MEET NEW PEOPLE GET OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONES AND CONNECT ABOUT THE HARDSHIPS THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON. WE ASK THEM AT THE END OF THE DAY TO ANONYMOUSLY SHARE ONE THING THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO DO DIFFERENTLY MOVING FORWARD. ONE STUDENT SHARED THAT THEY WOULD SPEAK UP FOR THOSE WITH NO VOICE. ANOTHER STUDENT SHARE THAT THEY WERE COMMITTED TO STAND UP FOR WHAT'S RIGHT. ANOTHER SAID I LEARNED JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT THE BULLY DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T HELP THE VICTIM. ANOTHER SHARED I'M COMMITTED TO MEET A LEADER NOT A FOLLOWER. OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE INCREMENTAL CHANGE BY HAVING MORE ON GOING SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS. THE USING POWER CONFERENCE IS JUST THE BEGINNING WE WOULD LIKE TO CREATE AN AMBASSADOR PROGRAM WHERE STUDENTS WHO ATTENDED THE CONFERENCE MEET REGULARLY THROUGHOUT HIGH SCHOOL TO BRAINSTORM IDEAS TO IMPLEMENT THE TOOLS THEY'VE LEARNED. IN SITUATIONS ARE WITNESSING AT SCHOOL. 63% OF THE STUDENTS WHO ATTENDED THE CONFERENCE THIS YEAR SO THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN STAYING INVOLVED WITH THE PROGRAM. ASSOCIATIONS WITH PEERS THAT ARE POSITIVE INFLUENCE AS WELL AS A CONNECTION OUR COMMITMENT TO SCHOOL REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF BOTH BOWLING AND ADOLESCENT EATING ABUSE. THE CONFERENCE PROVIDE STUDENTS THE SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE TO SAFELY INTERVENING COMPLEX THEY WITNESS IT TAKES LONGER TERM TRAINING TO KEEP IT UP. SHORT TERM INTERVENTION PROGRAMS IGNORE THE ONGOING CONDITIONS THAT NORMALIZED VIOLENCE. ONGOING BYSTANDER INTERVENTION PRACTICES. CAN BE THE FOUNDATION FOR CHALLENGING SOCIAL NORMS. STUDENTS CONTINUALLY SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN INTERVENING WHILE LEARNING TO BECOME BETTER ALLIES. THE LOW COST INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING IS MAKING AN IMPACT. WITH MORE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING WE COULD DO EVEN MORE. TO KEEP OUR PREVENTION PROGRAMMING SECURE WE SEEK OUT GRANT OPPORTUNITIES BUT THEY'RE HARD TO COME BY. AS OF RIGHT NOW OUR PROGRAM IS FUNDED BY TEMPORARY GRANTS THE REALITY IS THAT BY THE END OF NEXT JUNE WHEN ONE OF OUR MAJOR GRANTS ENDS WE COULD RISK LOSING TO PREVENTION. I CATALYSTS WE BELIEVE THAT LOVE SHOULDN'T HURT WE BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE DESERVES TO FEEL SAFE IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. PREVENTION IS THE KEY TO REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ABUSE. WE ALL HAVE A ROLE IN KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. WITHOUT ONGOING SUSTAINABLE PREVENTION FUNDING THIS CRUCIAL WORK IS AT RISK OF COMING TO AN END THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SERRA AND MELODY. YEAH HI EVERYONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE THANK YOU CHAIRMAN RUBIO. FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER HAD SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC SO I'M MELODY CRISPO THEN I'M FROM PEACE OVER VIOLENCE IN LOS ANGELES -- AND WE ARE A TOOL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE PROGRAM THAT SERVES THE COMMUNITY WE WERE FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE SO WE'RE ONE OF THE OLDEST ORGANIZATIONS TO BE DOING THIS KIND OF WORK IN THE NATION -- AND WE'VE BEEN DOING PREVENTION WORK SPECIFICALLY FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS SO I'VE ALSO BEEN DOING THIS FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AND SOMETHING THAT I FEEL. INCREDIBLY LUCKY. TO BE ABLE TO SAY IS THAT I RUN A PREVENTION DEPARTMENT OF EIGHT PEOPLE I INCLUDING MYSELF SO AS THE DIRECTOR OF PREVENTION AND POLICY AT PEACE OVER VIOLENCE -- WE DO A LOT OF WORK -- IN THE COMMUNITY THAT'S PREVENTION RELATED -- ALONG WITH THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS' SO WE DO EMERGENCY SERVICES INTERVENTION SERVICES WE ALSO RUN THAT LOS ANGELES RAPING BATTERING HOTLINE. AS WELL AS REALLY THE FIRST OF ITS KIND OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT HOTLINE OF FOR METRO ARE COUNTY WIDE -- PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. SO I MEAN I I'M LIKE VERY VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT PREVENTION AND THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND PREVENTION IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO PREVENT YOUNG PEOPLE FROM EXPERIENCING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THEIR ADULTHOOD BUT ALSO BECAUSE THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE IMPACTING THEM NOW. AND WE CAN LOOK AT PREVENTION A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN LOOK AT IT AS YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO TO TRY AND PREVENT AN INCIDENT OF VIOLENCE OCCURRING AGAIN TO A STUDENT WHO PERHAPS IS ALREADY DEALT WITH THIS. BUT ALSO HOW CAN WE DO PRIMARY PREVENTION AND TRAIN US STOP IT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE -- WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT DATING VIOLENCE SEXUAL VIOLENCE TEEN DATING VIOLENCE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. I IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT THE TWO PEOPLE INVOLVED IT SPILLS OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY THERE'S EMERGING RESEARCH THAT THERE'S A STRONG CONNECTION TO GUN VIOLENCE -- AND THAT SOME OF THE FATALITIES OF OF PARTICULARLY YOUNG WOMEN -- IN DATING RELATIONSHIPS -- ARE ARE LINKED TO GUN VIOLENCE AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR SCHOOLS. AND ONE THING WE CAN DO TO HELP ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IS TALK ABOUT THE PREVENTION OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND DATING VIOLENCE -- AND YOU KNOW IT DATING VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAIN JUST HAVE SO MANY SHARED RISK FACTORS AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS WITH OTHER ISSUES THAT WE CARE ABOUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. LIKE GANG VIOLENCE LIKE SUICIDE LIKE UNWANTED PREGNANCIES THAT AGAIN IF WE COULD JUST KIND OF TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT BUILDING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. WE COULD HAVE THIS HUGE RIPPLE EFFECT INTO OTHER ISSUES SO WHAT I WANTED TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME DOING WAS TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE KIND OF A RAY OF DIFFERENT PREVENTION PROGRAMS WE DO AT PEACE OVER VIOLENCE JUST TO SHOW. THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR IT AND THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO GO ABOUT IT -- SO. I WANTED TO START WITH SOME OF OUR SCHOOL BASED PROGRAM JUST BECAUSE THAT IS A REALLY GREAT WAY TO WORK WITH YOUTH DIRECTLY AS WITH THE SCHOOLS SO. WE WORKED MOST CLOSELY WITH LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IT'S THE SECOND LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE NATION WITH OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND TEACHERS AND STAFF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS -- AND THE UNFORTUNATE FACT IS THAT WE CAN'T REACH THEM ALL BECAUSE OF THAT SIZE AND SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR IN TRYING TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR PREVENTION IS. DOING EQUITABLE WORK ACROSS THE SCHOOLS YOU KNOW IT SHOULDN'T YOUR PROTECTION AND YOUR SAFETY SHOULDN'T BE DICTATED BECAUSE YOU HAPPEN TO BE S. AT A SCHOOL NEAR PEACE OVER VIOLENCE OR NEAR ONE OF OUR SISTER AGENCIES AT SOMETHING. THAT SHOULD BE GUARANTEED TO EVERYBODY SO -- WE DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS WITH SCHOOLS WE HAVE A CURRICULUM THAT WE DEVELOPED AT PEACE OVER VIOLENCE THAT'S USED ACROSS THE COUNTRY CALLED IN TOUCH WITH TEENS. IT'S A COMPREHENSIVE VIOLENCE PREVENTION CURRICULUM THAT ADDRESSES BOTH SEXUAL ASSAULT AND DATING VIOLENCE SO THAT STUDENTS NOT ONLY LEARN THE WARNING SIGNS BUT ARE ALSO LEARNING HOW TO HAVE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS HOW TO DO CONFLICT RESOLUTION. HOW TO TALK ABOUT THEIR BOUNDARIES AND CONSENT HOW TO UNDERSTAND -- HOW THEY SEE VIOLENCE AND GENDER IN THE MEDIA THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT'S REALLY REALLY FUN? WE DO IT WITH YOU THAN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND WE PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS AND ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND ACTUALLY -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SOME OF THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF DOCTOR TEN DAHLE AT USC -- ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO I'M MOST OFTEN WERE IN CLASS LIKE HEALTH CLASSES -- TO TRY AND FIT THIS IN A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS ARE COMING TO US TO HELP SUPPLEMENT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT OF WHICH YOU KNOW EXPANDED SEX EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS -- NOT ONLY TO MAKE IT MANDATORY BUT TO SAY THAT. STUDENTS HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT THEY HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT -- HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP SKILLS AND A LOT OF THEM. THEY DON'T HAVE ALREADY THE CURRICULUM TO DO THAT AND SO THEY'VE BEEN CALLING US TO HELP SUPPLEMENT THAT PART OF THE SEX THAT EDUCATION -- BUT AGAIN THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES LIKE WITH PASADENA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ANOTHER -- DISTRICT WITHIN OUR SERVICE AREA BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS THAT THAT DISTRICTS SPECIFICALLY HAS BEEN SEEING. THEY'VE CUT HEALTH CLASSES AND SO IT'S IT'S REALLY ABOUT LIKE WE HAVE MATH TEACHERS TRYING TO TEACH SEX ED AND HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS NOT TO SAY THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT IT OR CAN'T DO IT. BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST SO MUCH COMPETITION FOR THIS -- WE ALSO DO CYCLE EDUCATIONAL GROUPS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS ARE AT HIGH RISK OF BEING VICTIMIZED OR OF VICTIMIZING OTHERS -- AND A LOT OF TIMES THOSE GROUPS ARE GENDER SPECIFIC SO WE ARE WORKING SPECIFICALLY WITH YOUNG MEN. SO THAT WE CAN TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BUILD HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS ADDRESSING LIKE TOXIC MASCULINITY THAT. BEING A MAN DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN BEING AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT AND DOMINATING TOWARDS WOMEN AND ADDRESSING LIKE HETERO NORMATIVITY IN SOME OF THE HOMOPHOBIA WITH YOUNG BOYS AND REALLY TRYING TO CONNECT THEM TO ADULT MALE MENTORS. WHO CAN MODEL TO THEM WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HEALTHY MAN -- AND AND HAVE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS -- AND WE ALSO DO CAMPAIGNS WITH THE STUDENTS ACROSS THE SCHOOLS LIKE DENIM DAY SO LA UNIFIED IN A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- PROCLAIM DENIM DAY FOR THE DISTRICTS AND HAVE THEIR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS WHERE THESE KINDS OF THINGS -- AND WE DO EMPOWERMENT SELF DEFENSE FOR GIRLS ALSO WHICH I THINK IS REALLY COOL AND WE TRY AND INJECT A LOT OF PREVENTION STRATEGIES IN THERE THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. LIKE THE PHYSICAL TECHNIQUES OF LEARNING HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF BUT REALLY TO TALK ABOUT IT'S OKAY TO BE ASSERTIVE IT'S OKAY TO SET BOUNDARIES -- AND HOW TO BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN WE ALSO FOCUS A LOT ON LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT WITH YOUNG PEOPLE SO WE ALSO HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE DOING PER GRAMS AT OUR OFFICE -- AND THROUGHOUT THEIR SCHOOLS TO BUILD THEIR LEADERSHIP SKILLS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. THE MORE EMPOWERED THAT YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL THE MORE OF THESE LIKE DEVELOPMENTAL AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS THAT THEY HAVE THE LESS VULNERABLE THEY ARE TOO AGAIN PERPETRATE VIOLENCE OR TO BE VICTIMIZED BY A VIOLENT SO -- WE HAVE A SCHOOL BASED PROGRAM CALLED STOP CLUBS THAT STANDS FOR STUDENTS TOGETHER ORGANIZING PIECE -- AND THAT'S FOR STUDENTS -- ON THEIR SCHOOL CAMPUSES TO REALLY TAKE THESE ACTIVITIES INTO THEIR HANDS AND DECIDE WHAT DO THEY WANT TO DO FOR THEIR SPECIFIC COMMUNITY BECAUSE NOT ALL OF LOS ANGELES IS THE SAME EVERY SCHOOL IS DEALING WITH A DIFFERENT ISSUE -- AND WE HAD A LOT OF SIX THAT I ACTUALLY STARTED OUT IN THE STOP CLUB PROGRAMS WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER -- AND AND THEY DID A LOT FOR MY LIFE I ALSO PRO I'M PROVIDING FOR YOU TODAY. AN ARTICLE THAT WAS WRITTEN ABOUT ONE OF OUR STUDENTS IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES -- HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF ONE OF OUR LOCAL STOP CLUBS -- AND HE GOT INTO HARVARD -- IT IS THE FIRST IN HIS FAMILY NOT ONLY TO BE GOING TO COLLEGE BUT TO GO TO HARVARD -- AND HE TALKS A LOT ABOUT HOW DOING THESE TYPES OF LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS TALKING ABOUT OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION HELPED HIM TO FEEL LIKE HE COULD BE A LEADER AND LIKE HARVARD WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ATTAINABLE TO HIM -- WE ALSO HAVE A FIVE WEEK. INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AN INSTITUTE THAT WE RUN EVERY SUMMER CALLED OUR YOUTH OVER VIOLENCE LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE OF WE ACCEPT THIRTY STUDENTS INTO THIS PROGRAM -- SO THAT THEY CAN GET REALLY IN DEPTH AND TO SEE THIRTY TEENAGERS SPENDING FIVE WEEKS OUT OF THEIR SUMMER ALL DAY JUST TO TALK ABOUT VIOLENCE PREVENTION IS INCREDIBLY INSPIRING -- AND WE LIKE TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST THE LEADERS OF TOMORROW THEY'RE THE LEADERS OF TODAY -- AND SO THEY WORK ON INTERNSHIPS PROJECTS THEY DO DIGITAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA SPOKEN WORD COMMUNITY ORGANIZING -- SO THAT THEY CAN REALLY ENGAGE THEIR PEERS ON THESE KINDS OF ISSUES AND I'VE ALSO REPORT. WHY DID TO YOU ANOTHER REPORT THAT WAS DONE BY THE NATIONAL RESOURCE CENTER ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT TALKS ABOUT THIS FIVE WEEK PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE AND HOW IMPACTFUL HOW BENEFICIAL IT IS IN YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES? BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS AGAIN KIND OF A DRESS THE SHARED PROTECTIVE FACTORS THAT HELP US KEEP STUDENTS SAFE AND WE WANT TO BUILD THINGS LIKE CONNECTEDNESS TO THEIR COMMUNITY TO THEIR SCHOOLS TO EACH OTHER. TO A TRUSTED ADULT BECAUSE THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT SAY -- HELP PREVENT VIOLENCE FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO THE STUDENTS REALLY TAKE ON ISSUES LIKE GUN VIOLENCE AND HOMELESSNESS AND THINGS THAT THEY CARE ABOUT -- THEY DO A DAY OF THE DEAD AT THE AT THE LOS MARCOS EVENTS -- WHERE THEY HONOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE PASSED BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE -- AND AND THAT'S A WAY TO BRING A CULTURAL AWARENESS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES ABOUT THIS SO. I CAN GO ON AND ON I'M GONNA STOP IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO LET ME KNOW. THANK YOU -- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I CAUGHT -- FROM THIS AND I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT -- SURVIVORS IN HOW WE HELP SURVIVORS BUT I THINK THE PREVENTION -- PORTION OF IT NOT JUST FOR FEMALES BUT FOR THE BUT THE BOYS IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WANT TO STOP THE THE CYCLE OF ABUSE -- AND I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST BY MEN OR BOYS WHO WHO -- ARE THE PERPETRATORS RIGHT THEY ARE ALSO VICTIMS BUT THE MAJORITY ARE MEN AND IF WE DON'T STOP THE CYCLE EARLY THEN WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TO TEACH -- YOU KNOW THE THE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AFTERWARDS -- BUT THANK YOU I WILL LEAVE -- AT OPEN FOR THE THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND AND ALL THE DIFFERENT WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED ANY OF THEM THE CULTURAL DIVIDES WITH THIS IN THIS CITY AND AND DIFFERENT GROUPS OF OF SOMETIMES -- HARBORING KEEPING ALL THAT WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ARE WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD AND HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT. YEAH I CAN ANSWER SO -- YOU KNOW BEING IN LOS ANGELES WE DO WORK WITH A VERY DIVERSE -- SET OF COMMUNITIES WE WORK WITH INDIGENOUS FOLKS WE WORK WITH -- THE LET NEXT COMMUNITY WITH DIFFERENT ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES MIDDLE EASTERN COMMUNITIES AND OFTEN. WE HAVE TO TAKE CULTURE INTO THE PERSPECTIVE AND SO LIKE I SAID THAT WAS ONE WAY THAT THE YOUTH CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA TO DO A DAY OF THE DEAD EVENT -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW. THE OF THE LOS MARCUS'S NOVEMBER FIRST OCTOBER IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH DO YOU KIND OF PUT THIS TOGETHER AND SAID WELL IF WE'RE HONORING THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED. LET'S USE THIS TO DRAW ATTENTION AND THIS IS AN EVENT THAT WE GET CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY COMING TO TO COME TAL TITUS -- TO HONOR THOSE TO THOSE VICTIMS AND SO WE HAVE TO TRY AND ADDRESS THINGS LIKE MUCH SHE MALL OR THE ROLE OF MEN AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE JUST. I HAD A A STUDENT REPORT LAST WEEK WHO IS MIDDLE EASTERN AMERICAN -- AND SHE WAS REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW HER DAD WOULD REACT WHEN HE FOUND OUT THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED -- AND WAS LIKE BEGGING US NOT TO TELL HIM BECAUSE SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HOW. THIS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED IN HER CULTURE AND WHITE SEXUAL SALTS -- MIGHT MEAN TO THEM AND SO IT CAN BE REALLY DIFFICULT AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO THINK ABOUT PREVENTION IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND TO PARTNER LIKE PEACE OVER VIOLENCE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING SO WE HAVE OTHER COMMUNITY OR BECAUSE WE WORK WITH THAT SPECIFICALLY WORK WITH DIFFERENT CULTURAL POPULATIONS -- BUT WE NEED SPACES TO ALSO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AND TALK TOGETHER AND SHARE RESOURCES SHARE INFORMATION SHARE TOOLS THAT ARE WORKING FOR EACH OF US. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS -- AND I APOLOGIZE I'M RUNNING A LITTLE BIT LATE HERE IN THIS -- IF IF YOU ALREADY COVERED SOME OF THESE THINGS BUT MAYBE IF JUST BRIEFLY LIKE KIND OF OUTLINE SOME OF THE THE BIG ISSUES THAT YOU'RE SEEING A MONK'S USE -- IF AND AND I SEE WE HAVE A MISSILE OF AN FROM CATALYST IN IN CHICO AND MY DISTRICT AND THEY DO GREAT WORK. IN THE COMMUNITY THERE. BUT YES MAYBE JUST. REALLY BRIEFLY IF IF YOU MAYBE HAVE ALREADY COVERED A LOT OF THIS STUFF. I JUST OUTLINED SOME OF THE BIG THINGS THAT YEARS YOU GUYS ARE SEEN. I YEAH I CAN GET STARTED THEM. I THINK THE YOUNG PEOPLE I'LL A BIG FEAR THAT WE SEE IS FEAR OF REPORTING -- BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GET THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE THEY DON'T GET THEIR PARTNERS IN TROUBLE ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A YOUNG PERSON WHO'S DATING SOMEONE OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR THERE ABOUT GETTING THEIR PARTNER IN TROUBLE -- SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE TRY TO WORK WITH AND WE DO ALSO DO A GROUP WITH JUVENILE HALL EVERY SINGLE WEEK -- WHICH IS A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH PEOPLE -- YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THE HIGHEST RISK -- AND WE KNOW THAT THE YEAH THE INCARCERATED YOUTH ARE ACTUALLY USE THAT MOST LIKELY HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED THEMSELVES FROM VARIOUS FORMS OF ABUSE WE TALK ABOUT ACES. THEY'RE PRETTY HIGH UP THERE ON THE SCALE SO WE WE WORK WITH THEM -- TO EMPOWER THEM TO BE ABLE TO MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES -- TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP COMMUNICATION SKILLS THINGS THAT MAYBE THEY'VE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO BEFORE -- SO HELPING THEM WITH THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS MENTIONED THE CULTURAL PIECE AS WELL AND WE DO HAVE A BI LINGUAL COMMUNICATOR ON STAFF WHO SPECIFICALLY WORKS OF THE LOT NEXT COMMUNITY -- AND TRIES TO MAKE OUR CONTENT RELEVANT FOR THAT COMMUNITY AS WELL BECAUSE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY THE CONCERN OF I'M LIKE AIRING YOUR DIRTY LAUNDRY. I'M HAVING A PRIVATE ISSUE BECOME PUBLIC AND AND ALSO DEFINITELY THE RELIGIOUS COMPONENT HAVE I'M WANTING TO STAY WITH YOUR PARTNER NOT WANTING TO DIVORCE AND I'M WANTING. TO TO FOLLOW AM FOLLOW THAT THOSE WAYS OF THINKING AND SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY AND SO I'M TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO KIND OF WORKING WITH. THEM -- WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM AS WELL SO THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT COME TO MIND FOR ME. THANKS YEAH I AGREE I AGREE WITH ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU SHARED AND I THINK THAT THE YOUTH THAT WE WORK WITH AND YOUTH CULTURE IN GENERAL RIGHT NOW AT LEAST IN MY SOMEWHAT ISOLATED COMMUNITY OF MARIPOSA -- THEY ARE VERY ENGAGED IN THEIR LIVES AND IN THE WORLD THE REALLY WELL INFORMED ABOUT ISSUES AND I THINK -- TECHNOLOGY HAS A LOT TO DO THAT -- I WOULD SAY THAT YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULTS -- TOO STILL ARE LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO HAVE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AND WHAT IS HEALTHY AND WHAT ISN'T AND OFTENTIMES CERTAIN BEHAVIORS ARE NORMALIZED LIKE CONTROLLING BEHAVIORS OR EXTREME JEALOUSY OR SO BEING ABLE. TO TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN CONTROLLING AND CARING BEHAVIOR IS A DIFFICULT THING FOR US ALL TO NAVIGATE AND SO THE MORE OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND TO SEE EXAMPLES OF HEALTHY A RESPECTFUL RELATIONSHIPS VERSES RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE MAYBE NOT BASED ON THE QUALITY. IS GREAT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND FOR ALL OF US AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO DEVELOPING OF LANGUAGE TO DISCUSS THESE TOPICS THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND CULTURES AND RACE AND SEX AND GENDER AND ALL THAT IT'S A LOT TO BREAK DOWN AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN A IN A HIGH QUALITY WAY I'M SO. THAT'S WHAT COMES TO MIND THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTION. I WANTED TO SAY TO SPECIFIC THINGS WERE SEEING IN LOS ANGELES AT LEAST -- ONE IS. WE HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORS IN LOS ANGELES SO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME FROM CENTRAL AND NORTHERN I'M -- AMERICA. AND WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH OUR ALLIES -- AND SO YOU MIGHT HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE USING ON HEALTHY BEHAVIORS BECAUSE PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT THEY EXPERIENCE FROM THEIR HOME COUNTRY OR THERE'S DIFFERENT CULTURE AND AND ACCEPTED BEHAVIORS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY AND AND HELPING TO PROVIDE THEM WITH EDUCATION ON THINGS LIKE CONSENT AND WHAT'S OKAY AND NOT. OKAY -- NOW THAT YOU'RE IN THIS COUNTRY AND SO EDUCATING THEM ABOUT -- THE LAWS HERE IN ABOUT SAFETY AND THINGS LIKE THAT ANOTHER THING WE'VE SEEN IS A REALLY BIG INCREASE IN REQUESTS FROM TEACHERS ON A BECAUSE WE PROVIDE TRAINING FOR TEACHERS AS WELL. TRAINING ON ADDRESSING SEXUAL HARASSMENT WE'VE SEEN A MARKET UP TICK IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT PARTICULARLY AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL -- THAT THE TEACHERS JUST HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME -- KNOWING HOW TO PREVENT OR OR TALK ABOUT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M INTERESTED IN GETTING THE INFORMATION ON ON YOUR PROGRAMS -- I AM YOU KNOW -- WANT. TO BRING SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS TO MY COMMUNITIES AS WELL AND SO IF ANYBODY'S INTERESTED IF YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION AND THE MODEL PROGRAMS BECAUSE I I THINK ALL THREE OF THEM. ARE EXCELLENT AND I I KNOW THAT THEIR SPECIFIC TO YOUR AREAS BUT I SEE THE VALUE IN THOSE AND I THINK THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW SOMEHOW I LEASE BRING THEM. TO OUR COMMUNITIES AS VIRAL SITE WHICH WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT AND YOU KNOW SPREADING AROUND THE PROGRAMS THAT I'M LISTENING. TO THAT YOU HAVE ARE AMAZING AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU WERE ALL ENGAGE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF OF CONVERSATIONS SO IF ANYBODY ELSE THAT IS LISTENING OR ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE WANTS TO MODEL SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS YOU'VE ALREADY. DONE IT YOU'RE ALREADY DOING IT AND I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN HOW YOU GOT THOSE GRANTS I'M STILL STUCK ON THE GRANT. WILL BECAUSE THE SEAT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE CDC WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS FOR FOR FOR PROGRAMS LIKE THIS AND NOW THAT WE KNOW -- WE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA FUNDED IT CAN ALSO BE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CDC I THINK THAT'S A VALUE TO OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE I'M PROBABLY THINKING ALL MORE MONEY MORE MONEY MORE MONEY THAT WE YOU KNOW THE THE THOSE. RESOURCES ARE LIMITED BUT IF WE CAN GET SOME OF THAT FUNDING FROM THE CDC SOME ALL THE VERY INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT WHAT THE BUT THE THE GRANT IS AND HOW WE CAN. HELP OTHER -- COMMUNITIES OBTAIN THOSE THOSE GRANT CELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR LADY'S FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IF WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL WHICH WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD I THINK WE ARE NEXT -- TOPIC IT'S CULTURALLY SPECIFIC PREVENTION WORK -- AND IF WE CAN HAVE CONNIE CHUNG JOE -- ALSO -- DANIEL MARTINEZ -- COME UP TO THE DIES PLEASE. WELCOME SO CONNIE WOULD YOU LIKE TO START YES AND YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME -- FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS I'VE SERVED AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF KOREAN AMERICAN FAMILY SERVICES ARE QUE PFAM WHERE THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION IN LOS ANGELES. ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF STRUGGLING CREAN AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE FORTY ONE STAFF WORK WITH OVER SEVEN THOUSAND CLIENTS A YEAR SERVING WITH SERVICES RANGING FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO MENTAL HEALTH TO FOSTER CARE AND OTHER FAMILY SUPPORT. FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS IN LARGE PART DUE FUNDING FROM BLUE SHIELD FOUNDATION K. FAMILIES INVESTED OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN TRAINING AND PARTNERING WITH CREE AND FAITH LEADERS. TO DATE WE'VE TRAINED OVER A THOUSAND KOREAN CLERGY ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TWO FORTY OUR TRAININGS SEMINARY CLASSES TO DAY RETREATS ALL THE CONFERENCES AND THER WORKSHOPS. LIKE MANY IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FAITH BASED INSTITUTIONS ARE CRITICAL BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE COMMUNITY COMES TOGETHER TO SOCIALIZE EXCHANGE INFORMATION. PASSED ON CULTURAL PRACTICES TO THEIR CHILDREN AND TO BREAK BACK AND TO BREAK BREAD OR IN OUR CASE WE SHARE KIMCHI. 7280% OF KOREAN IMMIGRANTS ATTEND CHURCH AND THAT'S WHERE THE FAMILY GOES WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS IT'S A PERSON THAT'S THEIR PASTOR OR THE PASTOR'S WIFE THAT THEY WANT TO SPEAK. TO THEY DO NOT COME FIRST TO A PROFESSIONAL D. V. AGENCY. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS HOW WE HEAR SIMILAR STORIES ACROSS SO MANY CULTURAL GROUPS ABOUT THE ROLE FAITH LEADERS PLAY IN ADDRESSING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. CASE THEM AS PART OF THE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NETWORK WHICH IS A GROUP OF SEVENTEEN CULTURALLY SPECIFIC AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE FUNDED BY BLUE SHIELD. THAT FOCUSES ON ADDRESSING TV IN OUR RESPECTIVE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WITH WE SHARE WITH EACH OTHER OUR LESSONS LEARNED IN OUR BEST PRACTICES AND WHAT'S SURPRISING IS DESPITE HOW DIFFERENT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE. THERE ARE SIMILARITIES IN THE WAY WE ARE SERVING ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES SO WHETHER YOU'RE IN CENTRAL VALLEY WORKING WITH AMONG SHAMANS OR IN OAKLAND WORKING WITH BLACK CHURCHES. ARE BASICALLY ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA WORKING WITH LATINO PRIEST. FAITH LEADERS ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO INFLUENCE CULTURAL NORMS AND SERVE AS FIRST RESPONDERS TO FAMILIES IN CRISIS. SO THERE'S A LOT OF TRUST BUILDING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU WORK WITH FAITH LEADERS. CREE INJURE CHURCHES IN GENERAL WE HOLD THE HOLD. CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN VALUES AND FEEL THEIR ROLE IS TO PUT THE FAMILY FIRST WHEREAS IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FIELD WHERE PROGRESSIVE FEMINIST BASED MOVEMENT WAY PUT THE SURVIVOR AT THE CENTER. SO CAN BE CHALLENGING REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE AT TIMES WHEN VALUES AND PERSPECTIVES SEEMS SO DISPARATE. SOMETHING TRANSFORMATIONAL HAPPENS WHEN YOU BRING A GROUP OF FAITH LEADERS TOGETHER AND LET THEM TALK TOGETHER ABOUT WITH TV LOOKS LIKE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO WHEN WE HAVE A TWO DAY RETREAT AND FEMALE FAITH LEADERS CHOOSE TO SET UP TILL TWO AM IN THE MORNING SO THEY CAN CONTINUE SHARING STORIES. SOMETHING MAGICAL HAPPENS IN THAT MOMENT BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE TAKING THE DB EDUCATION THAT THEY'VE LEARNED FROM EARLIER IN THAT DAY. AND THEY'RE TURNING IT INTO A PERSONAL REFLECTION. ON HOW THEY OR THOSE AROUND THEM HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY TV. AND TV SHOULD BE A PERSONAL DISCUSSION BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY IT. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT ONE IN THREE WOMEN EXPERIENCE TV IN HER LIFETIME HOW CAN IT NOT BE SOMETHING PERSONAL TO ALL OF US? STATISTICALLY SPEAKING UNLESS YOU LIVE ALONE IN A DESERTED ISLAND WE ARE ALL CONNECTED TO SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCE TV WHETHER IT'S A RELATIVE OR FRIEND A COLLEAGUE OF CONGRESS OR OUR AND THAT'S THE VALUE OF PREVENTION WORK IT TAKES WE SEE. IT TAKES WHAT SEEMS LIKE AN ABSTRACT SOCIETAL ILL AND IT TURNS IT INTO SOMETHING DEEPLY PERSONAL THAT EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO AND WANT TO FIX. LAST YEAR WHEN I TESTIFIED I SHARED WITH SOME OF YOU MY OWN PERSONAL STORY ABOUT COMING FROM A FAMILY WITH THREE GENERATIONS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. HOW MY MOTHER GREW UP WITH AN ABUSIVE FATHER? AND ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS A TEENAGER. SHE WENT TO HER ROOM. AND SHE SLIT HER WRISTS. AND SHE WROTE A MESSAGE TO HER FATHER WITH HER OWN BLOOD. AND SHE SAID THAT IF SHE EVER SAW MY GRANDFATHER HIT MY GRANDMOTHER AGAIN SHE WOULD KILL HERSELF. I SHARED HOW THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AROUND ME WHO EXPERIENCE TV. AND HOW I WORRY THAT TV MIGHT PASS ALONG TO THE FOURTH GENERATION OF MY CHILDREN AND MY NIECES AND NEPHEWS. WHAT I DIDN'T SHARE WAS THAT WHEN I STARTED AT DICK AT CAPE DAM IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT TV WAS A PERSONAL ISSUE? MY PARENTS WERE NOT ABUSIVE TOWARDS IT THEN IT TOWARDS EACH OTHER I HAD NEVER BEEN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. THEREFORE IT SEEMS LIKE AN ABSTRACT PROBLEM. IT WAS ONLY AFTER I STARTED WORKING AT QUE PFAM DID I START TO REALIZE THAT MY FAMILY'S HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE WITH TV WAS OF COURSE PERSONAL. AND EVEN IF I NEVER WITNESSED ABUSE MYSELF KNOWING THAT MY GRANDFATHER'S ABUSE HAS LEFT A LEGACY THAT'S BEEN PASSED FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION DOWN OUR FAMILY TREE. NOW MAKES IT A DEEPLY PERSONAL ISSUE. EVERYONE OF THE FAITH LEADERS WE TRAIN AT KEITH THEM KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A VICTIM OR PERPETRATOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ALTHOUGH MOST DO NOT REAL RECOGNIZE THAT BEFORE THEY COME TO OUR TRAINING. BUT THEN WE START TO TALK ABOUT KOREAN COMMUNITIES. AND HOW THE INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLE OF VIOLENCE HAS A LONG TERM DEVASTATING IMPACT ON OUR CHILDREN. WHO GO ON TO REPEAT WHAT THEY SAW WITH THEIR PARENTS? AND THAT'S WHEN OUR FAITH LEADER START TO THINK ABOUTTHEIR OWN FAMILIES AND THEIR OWN CHILDHOODS AND THEIR OWN FRIENDS AND THEIR CONGREGANTS AND THEY REALIZE THAT THEY WERE PATTERNS AND SIGNS OF ABUSE EVERYWHERE AROUND THEM. AFTER THE TRAININGS WE SEE AN INCREASE IN REFERRALS BECAUSE THE FAITH LEADERS KNOW NOW HOW TO IDENTIFY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BEYOND A BLACK GUY OR HOSPITAL VISITS. AND THEY KNOW HOW TO APPROACH THE SUBJECT OF GETTING SOMEONE TO A TV AGENCY FOR HELP. RATHER THAN LIMITING THEIR INTERVENTION TO PRAYER ALONE. LAST YEAR KPM SERVED A HUNDRED CREE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS THIS IS THE HIGHEST NUMBER WE HAVE EVER SERVED AND A MANYOF THOSE REFERRALS CAME TO US THROUGH THE FAITH LEADERS WHO HAD RECEIVED OUR TRAINING. FOR MORE THAN JUST THE UP TAKEN REFERRALS THERE'S A SLOWER SUDLER BUT EVEN MORE PROFOUND CHANGE THAT'S OCCURRING THROUGH THESE TRAININGS. BECAUSE AS FAITH LEADERS CHANGE THE WAY THEY THINK ABOUT THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THEY START TALKING AND PREACHING ABOUT HOW EVIL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS. HOW IT DESTROYS OUR FAMILIES AND HOW THERE IS NO PLACE FOR IT IN A CHRISTIAN FAMILY? WHEREAS THE STARTED OFF BELIEVING THAT TV MUST BE IN TOUR FOR THE SAKE OF PROTECTING A FAMILY ONCE THEY GET TRAINED THEY REALIZE SAID TV MUST BE STOPPED FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY. THIS CHANGE MENTALITIES BEING SPREAD BY ARGUABLY THE MOST INFLUENCE INFLUENTIAL LEADERS OF OUR CLEAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. AND I SEE ARGUABLY BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE BTS THAT'S TAKING OVER THE WORLD. BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW MANY CRISIS CALLS KVM ANSWERS HOW MANY SAFETY PLANS WE CREATE OR HOW MANY RESTRAINING ORDERS WE FILE. THOSE WILL NOT LEAD OUR COMMUNITY TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IT'S THE CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARDS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITH ART THOUSAND TRAINED FAITH LEADERS ARE SPREADING. THAT IS WHAT WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE END OF TV IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT IS WHY AS A MEMBER OF THE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NETWORK AND AS A PART OF THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- WE A WE URGE THE STATE TO CONSIDER HOW TO FIND ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION WORK. THAT WILL ALLOW NEW AND INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT WILL REACH UNDERSERVED CULTURALLY SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES LIKE OURS. WHO HAD BEEN TRADITIONALLYSO HARD TO REACH IN THE STATE? THANK YOU I'M. IT SOUNDS LIKE -- IT'S NOT JUST A KOREAN AMERICAN -- ISSUE I THINK THAT IF WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THAT THAT INFORMATION AND BRING IT TO ALL OF OUR LATINO CHURCHES AND YOU KNOW ALL THE OTHER CHURCHES I THINK THAT'S THE THE TYPE OF TRAINING THAT I THAT I THINK WE ALL NEED AND SO I THINK YOU -- FOR FOR FOR PRESENTING AND IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL OR ANY COMMENTS. I'M SORRY FROM THE COMMITTEE IS. DOES IS SAY I MEAN THAT WAS VERY POWERFUL STORE THAT YOU SHARED -- AND HOW THAT IS IS WORKING WITH AND ARE WORKING IN AND THROUGH OUR FAITH COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW TO RECOGNIZE THIS AS AN ISSUE AND I AM SEEN THAT MORE MORE I I I I SEE IN THE FAITH COMMUNITIES. MY BROTHER IN LAW'S ACTUALLY PASTOR -- DOWN IN -- IN THE POWER WAY AREA -- AND THEY RECENTLY HELD A CONFERENCE WHERE. THEY HAD RACHEL -- DEN HOLLANDER COME AND SPEAK AND TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW HER. HER GROWING UP IN THE CHURCH AND YOU KNOW WHEN SHE HAD FIRST TALKED ABOUT THIS PEOPLE NOT -- NOT BELIEVING HER IGHT -- AND HOW BUT HOW. THROUGH HER FAITH COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW THAT THAT BEGAN TO CHANGE. AND ULTIMATELY LED TO HER BEING THE FIRST TO COME FORWARD AGAINST LARRY NASSER -- AND AND EVERYTHING THAT TRANSPIRED -- THEREAFTER -- BUT HOW OUR FAITH COMMUNITIES AS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT CAN MAYBE. ONE THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT THINGS WE LEARN FROM OUR FAITH COMMITTEES HAVING LOVING COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS YOU KNOW THOSE ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY HEALTHY THINGS -- BUT AS SOMEONE ELSE -- MENTION MAYBE AT TIMES LIKE SAY HEY NOT WE DON'T WANT AREA AIR DIRTY LAUNDRY. THESE -- KIND OF NOT WANTING TO TALK ABOUT MANY THINGS THAT ARE NOT GOING SO WELL -- FOR FEAR OF OF SOME KIND OF EFFECT A REPUTATION OR AND SO. YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME GREAT WORK I THINK IS GOING ON IN OUR CHURCHES AND OUR FAITH COMMUNITIES WHERE IT'S SAYING HEY LET'S. LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING AND LETS. YOU KNOW EMPOWER BUYER FACE WORK THROUGH THOSE THINGS AND AND ACTUALLY BRING ABOUT. HEALING AND RECONCILIATION -- AND AND AND CALLING OUT THESE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON RIGHT AND NOT BEING AFRAID TO CALL THEM OUT -- THAT THAT'S REALLY PART OF THAT'S REALLY PART OF OF OUR FAITH RIGHT -- IT IS FAITH IN ACTION -- AND SO -- ANYWAYS I JUST I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY THAT YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION AND YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD WORK THEY ARE DOING AND CERTAINLY WHAT I THINK THIS IS. SOMETHING WE'RE SEEING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS AND AND HOPEFULLY WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND I THINK -- YOU KNOW. EVERY TIME. A SURVIVOR A CHILD TO SURVIVE TELL THEIR STORY I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BRING IT OUT OF THE DARKNESS I THINK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR MOM STORAGE HERE TODAY -- AND I THINK THAT IT'S SUCH A GREAT MODEL THAT YOU GUYS ARE USING LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER SPOKE ABOUT USING TRUSTED COMMUNITIES RIGHT I MEAN THE FAITH BASED COMMUNITIES OF THE COMMUNITIES WE TRUST WHERE WE FEEL SAFE. RIGHT IN TRAINING THOSE THAT THE COMMUNITY ALREADY TRUST TO BE OUR PARTNERS IN HELPING IDENTIFY THIS AND BREAK THE CYCLE AS YOU DESCRIBED I THINK IS SO CRUCIAL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD URGE US TO THINK ABOUT IS -- EXPANDING HIS WORK IN FAITH BASED COMMUNITIES AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED BUT ALSO THINKING WHAT ARE THE OTHER TRUSTED COMMUNITIES THAT WE CAN TAKE THIS INTO OUT YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO FAITH BASED WORK BUT ALSO. LOOK AT WHERE TO WE HAVE TRUSTED SOURCES THAT WE CAN TRAIN PEOPLE SO THAT IT'S NOT HAVING TO GO SOMEWHERE NEW. TO GET STARTED IN THE PROCESS OF HEALING AND BREAKING THE CYCLE AND SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND I HOPE WE CAN EXPAND IT [inaudible] WITH A WITH THE TREES. IT WAS IT WAS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL FOR ME TO HEAR -- TO HEAR YOUR STORY AND HEAR ABOUT THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING I AM SO IN WHEN I WAS GROWING AT IN A FAITH BASED COMMUNITY UNFORTUNATELY. YOU KNOW THAT. THE THE PASTOR WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUR TRUSTED ADVISER AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO INTERVENE. YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WE WENT AND TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THE FACT THAT MY MOTHER WAS BEING ABUSED IN MY STEP BROTHER IS BEING ABUSED. HE SAID SAID TO ME AS A TWELVE YEAR OLD HE SAID WELL THE MAN IS THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND HE'S THE ONE WHO WHO NEEDS TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOUR FAMILY AND THAT WAY IS. THAT WAS WRONG NOT IN AT NIGHT I THINK IN ANY OF OUR FAITH TRADITIONS. YOU KNOW WHAT OUR FAITH IS ABOUT AND I'M YOU KNOW WHAT FAMILY IS ABOUT WHAT SUPPORT IS ABOUT SO. IT'S REALLY ENCOURAGING TO ME TO HEAR. I THINK THAT WE'RE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS AND YOUR CLEARLY THE ROLE THAT FAITH LEADERS PLAY AND HELPING ADDRESS THIS IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL SO. I'M VERY ENCOURAGED AND AS YOU SAID. VERY INTERESTED IN THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE TAKE SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT HAVE WORKED IN THE COMMUNITIES ARE WORKING WITH. AN AMPLIFIED THAT -- ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES AND ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU MISTER GOOD. DOES WAS A THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COURAGE -- I WORK WITH THE FAITH BASED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE AGAIN -- THE FAITH BASED COMMUNITY STANDS AS A LEADER -- IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SHOULD CERTAINLY BE -- ONE TRUSTED BUT ALSO TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE GENERATIONAL CURSES -- AND BREAKING THE CURSE -- AND IS IS GENERATIONAL BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW SOMEONE SEE THAT YOU KNOW DADDY'S BEATING MOMMY AND THEN WHEN HE GROWS UP HE THINKS THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS THE WRONG THING TO DO. LOVE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HURT. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN LOVE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HURT RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE TO START REALLY -- USING MY COLLEAGUES -- COMMENTS THAT GOING TO THE FAITH BASED LEADER AND NOT GETTING THE SUPPORT. IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHY WE NEED -- TO TRAIN OUR FAITH BASED LEADERS IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA SO WE CAN BEGIN TO TEAR DOWN THE WALLS -- AND ALSO BREAK THE CURSES THAT CREEPS INTO OUR HOMES AND SO I WANT TO ENGAGE ENCOURAGE YOU -- ONE LADY SAID I USED TO USE IT USE THE PHRASE -- DV SHE SAID DON'T DO THAT. DON'T DON'T USE THAT TV SAID OUT LOUD TO EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT D. V. MEANS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND SAID OFTEN -- AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN SO WHEN SOMEONE HEAR YOU SAYING NOT D. V. BUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT COULD BE THE PERPETRATOR THAT COULD BE THE INDIVIDUAL OR VICTIM HEARING THE WORDS. AND ALSO SOMETHING CAN CHANGE IN TERMS OF SEEKING HELP OR STOP DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND SO WE WANT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE THE WORD -- I'LL USE THEM AND IN A VERY LOUD VOICE -- SO THEY CAN RESIGNATION -- NOW IN THE CHAMBERS BUT ALSO IN THE HALLS AS WELL AS WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU CONTINUE ON SPREADING THE WORD AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MOST THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOU ALLUDED TO OF GENERATIONS OF OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND AND SOME OF THOSE HOW DID HOW DO YOU THEN WORK WITHIN THE THE CULTURAL ASPECT TO START TO GET AWAY FROM. THOSE THINGS I I KNOW THAT IN SOME CULTURES IT'S A VERY RUDE -- ME IN AND AND HOW THINGS ARE ARE BEING PERPETRATED BASED ON WHAT THEY'VE SEEN PRIOR AND FEEL THAT IS PART OF THE THE THE CULTURAL ASPECT OF IT. SO HOW DO YOU DIVE INTO THAT AND START TO CHANGE THAT FROM THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM FROM THE BEGINNING RIGHT AND AND I I AGREE WITH THAT I AND I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME OF MY LATINO COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER ADVOCATES SAY TALK ABOUT THEM THAT YOU SMALL IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THE CULTURE AS WELL -- SO CREAM CULTURE BEING THAT IS A CONFUCIAN PATRIARCHAL THE OTHER BASED SOCIETY THERE IS THIS HISTORY OF IT BEING VERY MALE DOMINATED AND THE FATHER HAS A RULE. THE WOMAN'S ROLE WAS TRADITIONALLY TO OBEY YOUR HOW YOUR FATHER THEN WHEN YOU GET MARRIED YOU'LL THEIR HOUSE SIGN AND THEN WHEN YOU GET OLDER YOU I EXCUSE ME YOUR SPOUSE AND THEN WHEN YOU GET. OLDER YOU'LL BE YOUR SIGN AND THAT WAS THE CONFUSION TEACHING AND SO THAT'S DEEPLY ROOTED IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO WHAT WE DO IS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE HEALTHY PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR CURRENT CREAM CULTURE THAT WE WANT TO KEEP. AND WE DO IT WE DO EMBRACE THE IDEA OF IMP FM FOR EXAMPLE RESPECTING YOUR ELDERS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS AND THAT THE FAMILY UNIT AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS BUT THEN WE START UNPACK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT HEALTHY ABOUT IT. SO WE TALK ABOUT GENDER NORMS AND WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT THE MAN FIRST HOW THAT IS SOME OF THE THE REASONS WHY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OCCURS IS BECAUSE THIS THIS POWER IMBALANCE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF RESPECTING ONE MAN. IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU RESPECT MAN AND SO IT IS. IT IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL THAT. THAT RESPECTING THE MAN IS ROOTED IN OUR CREAM CULTURE AND SO WE TRY TO TEACH THAT NO -- CREAM CULTURES. NECESSARILY A BALLOT FEES ON HEALTHY GENDER. NORMS IN DYNAMICS BUT IT IS LET'S PROMOTE SOME OF THE HEALTHIER PARTS OF OF THAT OUT OF THAT WE LIKE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND NOT OTHERS. THERE USED O BE A KOREAN SAYING BACK IN THE DAY AND IT WENT SOMETHING LIKE -- YOU TREAT EACH YEAR WOMEN AND THERE'S A DRIED FISH THAT KOREANS EAT IN THE SAME WAY THEY SHOULD BE BEATEN EVERY THREE DAYS BECAUSE THIS FISH NEEDS TO BE POUNDED IN ORDER TO BE SOFT ENOUGH TO EAT. AS WE TALK ABOUT HOW THAT USED TO BE THE NORM IN OUR CREAM COMMUNITY BACK WELL MANY MANY DECADES AGO BUT WE SAY HOW FOOLISH AND HOW WRONG THAT IS NOW AND PEOPLE. CAN AGREE WITH THAT THAT WE HAVE EVOLVED FROM THAT SO IT'S CONTINUING TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO EVOLVE OUR CULTURE AND THAT IF WE WANT TO ADDRESS THINGS LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SOCIAL SEXUAL ASSAULT. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE PATRIARCHAL GENDER NORMS AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT WHEN THEY SEE WHAT. WHAT THE IMPACT HOUSE ON THE FAMILY? AND IF I'M AT MY MAY RESPOND TO SOME OF THE OTHER COMMENTS -- BUT YOU KNOW I DO APPRECIATE YOU SHARING WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT WHAT YOUR FAITH LEADER HAS SAID TO YOU AS A CHILD AND WE'VE HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES FROM OUR SURVIVORS. SOME LIKE THAT THAT ARE REALLY DEVASTATING AND OTHERS WHERE THEY'VE BEEN REALLY SUPPORTIVE -- TO THE THE SURVIVOR AND HER CHILDREN. AND IT MAKES A NIGHT AND DAY DIFFERENCE THE WAY YOUR FACE LEADER RESPONDS YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR FAITH IN GOD IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TREATED AND SUPPORTED DURING THEIR MOMENTS OF CRISIS. AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN REINFORCED IN THEIR FAITH -- BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED AND GONE ON TO HELP OTHERS AND SO WE DO SEE IT SO POWERFUL WHEN THE FAITH LEADERS CAN HAVE SO MUCH INFLUENCE. IN IN IN CREATING A BETTER SITUATION OR WERE SITUATION AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT AT MORE ADVOCATES REALIZING THAT AS WELL. BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING MORE AND MORE REQUESTS FOR TRAINING FROM ADVOCATES IN ALL DIFFERENT CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES ONE NEED TO KNOW WHAT OUR BEST PRACTICES AND STRATEGIES ARE. BECAUSE WHAT'S INTERESTING IS NO MATTER HOW DIFFERENT OUR CULTURES ARE SOME OF THE STRATEGIES AND THE WAY YOU WANT TO BUILD THE BRIDGE WITH FAITH LEADERS. ARE IN MANY WAYS UNIVERSAL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS KATE THEN WE CAN CONTINUE WITH DANIEL THANK YOU DONNA FOR OF PATIENTLY WAITING. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- MY NAME IS DANIEL MARTINEZ I WORK AT THE LGBT Q. CENTER LONG BEACH AS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELOR ADVOCATE -- LITTLE HISTORY ABOUT ME I WILL SAY I DID -- POST GRADUATING I DID TWO YEARS OF WORKING IN BETTER THAN A MENTOR PROGRAMS SO INTERVENTION PROGRAMS WITH WITH -- BATTERS MAINLY MALE A LAND NECKS IDENTIFIED -- FROM THERE I GOT HURT AT THE TO BE TQ CENTER BECAUSE OF THAT JOB BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO START DOING PREVENTION WORK PRE THEM GOING INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM -- SO AT THE LGBT Q.

THEY'LL TO BE TOO CUTE COMMUNITY CLOSER TO MESSI BALANCE INCLUDING THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY THEMSELVES SO THE WAY WE GET CLIENTS THERE IS THEY COME FUNNELED THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH -- DEPARTMENT WHICH THEY WANT TO DO COUPLES COUNSELING SO FROM THERE THEY ARE SENT TO US. AND WE DO AN ASSESSMENT EVENTUALLY TO SEE IF THEY ARE ARE FIT -- FOR COUPLES COUNSELLING WE DO NOTICE THAT A LOT OF TIMES -- COUPLES WANT TO TO COUPLES COUNSELING THERE IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE RELATIONSHIP SO WE FEEL LIKE IT'S UNSAFE TO PUT THEM IN A ROOM TOGTHER JUST TO BASICALLY. LIKE LIKE WE SAID ERROR OUT THEIR LAUNDRY AND THEN GO BACK HOME AND SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN -- MY CUT SAID THAT ALSO MEN GO THROUGH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND IT IS TRUE MEN ALSO WATER TO MY CERVANTES AND ALONG WITH OUR CHANCE IDENTIFIED PEOPLE AND OR NON CONFORMING PEOPLE -- IT IS REALLY HARD FOR FOR PEOPLE TO GET SERVICES -- JUST BECAUSE SPECIALLY WITH VICTIMS FOR SHELTER THAT THEY WE WE SENT A CHANCE ON THE TO A SHELTER A LOT OF TIMES SHELTERS WILL TAKE THEM IN BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW. TO HANDLE A TRANS WOMAN THERE LIKE WHEN THEY WERE BORN MALE WHAT DO WE DO WHAT WE PUT THEM WE DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD PUT THEM WITH THE WOMEN ARE THE MEN -- ALSO MY TYPE WORK IS I DO LIKE I SAID TO OUR PREVENTION SO WHAT WE DO IS ONCE WE SEE THE COUPLES ARE. CAPABLE OF DOING COUPLES COUNSELLING WE SEPARATE THEM FIRST WE WAITED BUYS THEM TO DO INDIVIDUAL CASTING. I USUALLY GET THE PEOPLE THAT ARE A LITTLE MORE ON THE AGGRESSIVE SIDE AND THE TO INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING WITH ME. AND ALSO A STRESS IMPAIRMENT AS JUST A POWER MANAGEMENT GROUP THAT I THAT I RUN -- I BELIEVE THAT MY WORKIS REALLY IMPORTANT JUST BECAUSE WE I'VE SEEN SO MANY CHANGES IN AND INDIVIDUALS EITHER WANTED TO MAKE CHANGES IN THE RELATIONSHIP REALIZING THAT THEIR THEIR BEHAVIORS ARE ARE ABUSIVE AND AND NOT HEALTHY. AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING THEM ALSO -- I RARELY WORK WITH SOME VICTIMS BUT WHEN I DO WORK WITH VICTIMS ALL THAT KIND OF WORK THAT I DO IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND I FEEL LIKE WE ESPECIALLY. SORRY-- MY MY AGENCY WE REALLY NEED THIS FUNDING JUST BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY TWO OF US WORKING ON MYSELF AND MY BOSS DOING THIS KIND OF WORK AND MY AGENCIES SO WHENEVER ONE OF US HAS TO LEAVE. THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSISTENT BACK IN THE OFFICE AND WE HAVE A BUNCH OF CLIENTS THAT WE HAVE TO SEE SO HAVING TO CANCEL CLIENT IS REALLY IS REALLY HARD FOR FOR THEM IN BECAUSE IT'S REALLY CRUCIAL WORK THAT WE DO WE'RE ALWAYS THERE FOR THEM IN. WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I KNOW YOU LEFT YOUR BOSS BY HIMSELF TO HIS. YES BUT THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON FROM THE THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] COMMENTS. CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THERE'S ONLY TWO OF YOU SERVING THIS WORK -- AT YOUR AGENCY HOW MANY OTHER AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA DO THIS WORK AND WHERE THEY LOCATED BECAUSE BEING IN THE BAY AREA I KNOW WE PROBABLY HAVE A HUGE NEED FOR THIS KIND OF SUPPORT FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS AS WELL. YEAH SO UNFORTUNATELY THE TWO AGENCIES IS LGBT Q. CENTER OF LONG BEACH AND LGBT Q. CENTER OF LOS ANGELES SO THAT BOTH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE NO SUS PORT FOR THOSE. SPECIFIC CULTURALLY RELEVANT SUPPORT FOR LGBT Q. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS IN THE BAY AREA EXACTLY.

A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO SERVE OUR LGBT COMMUNITY WHO COME IN THROUGH -- CENTERS ARE NON PROFITS YEAH. YES SO DEFINITELY I KNOW LIKE THIS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN VERY -- BINARY WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN ARE ARE VICTIMS MANNER ARE USUALLY THE BATTERS AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY IT'S MORE COMPLEX. RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF IDENTITIES -- SEX ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE TEND TO TO GET CONFUSED WHEN IT COMES TO THIS RIGHT YOU KNOW LET'S SAY THERE IS -- A LESBIAN COUPLE RIGHT AND THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ONE IS MORE MASCULINE PRESENTING WITH MORE FEMALE PRESENTING SOMETIMES WHEN WHEN -- LAW ENFORCEMENT GETS INVOLVED THEY AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME THAT THE MORE MASCULINE PRESENTING -- WOMAN IS THE AGGRESSOR JUST BECAUSE OF OUR OUR GENDER NORMS SO DEFINITELY THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX WHEN IT COMES TO TO ROLES -- WOMEN CAN BE ABUSIVE AS WELL -- AND ANYONE CAN BE ABUSIVE RIGHT ANYONE CAN FALL INTO INTO THIS THIS ROLE IT'S JUST IT'S JUST ALL ABOUT -- LEARNING THESE BEHAVIORS AND ON LEARNING -- UNHEALTHY ONES MS RIVER.

PERSON RAMBO AND VIRGINIA TO PLACES -- PLEASE COME UP REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. VIRGINIA WOULD LIKE TO START THANK YOU. OKAY I'M EXT CHRISTEN THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS KRISTEN RAMBO. AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF STAND STRONG. A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ORGANIZATION IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. I AM NEWISH TO CALIFORNIA I MOVED HERE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO FROM ATLANTA GEORGIA. SO THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN YOUR CAPITOL BUILDING AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND THANK YOU ESPECIALLY TO YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO FOR SHARING THIS COMMITTEE AND FOR GIVING VOICE TO THIS ISSUE. IN ATLANTA I WORKED AT THE US CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION THE CDC. WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS THE NATION'S PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY. MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING THINGS LIKE FLU AND EBOLA. THE CDC ALSO HAS A DIVISION OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION. AND THAT IS BECAUSE VIOLENCE IS A LEADING CAUSE OF INJURY AND DEATH IN THIS COUNTRY. SO FOR THAT REASON IT REQUIRES A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH AND THE GOAL IS TO TRULY PREVENT THE VIOLENCE. TO STOP IT BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS. IN THE DIVISION OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION I LED THE CDC'S NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAM. IN THAT ROLE I GOT TO SEE WHAT VIOLENCE PREVENTION LOOKS LIKE IN STATES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND I LEARNED A LOT OF THINGS THERE THAT HAVE CARRIED THROUGH IN MY ROLE IT STANDS STRONG HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR ONE THING I LEARNED MORE ABOUT A PROGRAM CALLED COACHING BOYS INTO MEN. WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO BE IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. THIS IS A PROGRAM WORKING WITH HIGH SCHOOL AGE MALE ATHLETES BUILDING ON THEIR STRENGTHS AS LEADERS AND INFLUENCERS IN THEIR PEER GROUPS. TO CHANGE THE CULTURE ON THAT TEAM IN THAT SCHOOL IN THEIR PEER GROUP. IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT ATHLETES OFTEN LEARN ON THE FIELD OR ON HE COURT. SUCH AS LEADERSHIP RESPECT AND COOPERATION. CAN ALSO TRANSLATE INTO SKILLS FOR PROMOTING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WHETHER IT'S WITH YOU KNOW OTHERS IN THEIR LIFE PARENTS PEERS AND CURRENT OR FUTURE ROMANTIC PARTNERS AS YOU. DISCUSS IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT ROMANTIC PARTNER COULD BE FRIENDS. SINCE COACHING BOYS INTO MEN BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND ONE THOUSANDS OF COACHES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE SIGNED ON AND WHAT'S EVEN MORE EXCITING. IS THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN RIGOROUSLY TESTED AND EVALUATED. AND THE RESULTS ARE SOME VERY ENCOURAGING OUTCOMES. IN THIS STUDY THAT INCLUDED SIXTEEN HIGH SCHOOLS AND OVER TWO THOUSAND ATHLETES THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ATHLETES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM NOT ONLY HAD GREATER INTENTIONS TO INTERVENE. WHEN THEY SAW ABUSIVE AND DISRESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR AMONG THEIR PEERS BUT THEY ACTUALLY DID SPEAK UP AND INTERVENE IN THESE SITUATIONS AT HIGHER RATES? THAN THOSE WHO HAD NOT BEEN THROUGH THE PROGRAM. NOT ONLY THAT BUT EVEN A YEAR AFTER COMPLETING THE PROGRAM. THOSE WHO HAD PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM HAD LOWER RATES OF ABUSE PERPETRATION. AND LOWER RATES OF PASSIVELY ALLOWING ABUSED TO HAPPEN AMONG THEIR PEERS. SO THIS RESEARCH TELLS US THAT YES IT REALLY IS POSSIBLE. TO STOP GENDER BASED VIOLENCE BEFORE IT STARTS AND THAT YES WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY WE'RE IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM INTO HIGH SCHOOL SO FAR. ONE CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN ONE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL. AT ONE OF THE SCHOOLS WE ARE WORKING WITH A VOLLEY BALL A GOLF AND THE BASEBALL TEAM RIGHT NOW. AND WE'RE ADDING FOOTBALL IN THE FALL. ALTHOUGH IT'S EARLY ON WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT THAT THIS PROGRAM IS HAVING. COACHES HAVE SHARED THAT THEY'VE NOTICED DIFFERENCES IN THEIR TEAMS MOSTLY IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY USE. AND HOW THEY HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND FOR THEIR WORDS. THEY'VE ALSO NOTICED THIS PROGRAM BRINGING TEAMS TOGETHER AND GETTING THEM TO COMMUNICATE ON A DEEPER LEVEL. ONE COACH SHARE THAT AFTER DISCUSSING HARMFUL LANGUAGE DURING ONE OF THEIR COACHING BOYS INTO MEN SESSIONS ONE STUDENT ACTUALLY CALLED ANOTHER ONE OUT. WHEN HE STARTED MAKING FUN OF HIS TEAMMATES? ANOTHER COACH HAS SEEN OLDER PLAYERS RISE TO LEADERSHIP ROLES IN THE PROGRAM SOMETIMES LEADING DISCUSSIONS ON THESE TOPICS SOMETIMES FOR OVER THIRTY MINUTES. HE SAID IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE ATHLETES WANT TO TALK ABOUT THESE TOPICS. BUT MANY OF THEM HAVE NEVER BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OR THE TOOLS TO COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS TO ONE ANOTHER. PRIOR TO THIS PROGRAM. ANOTHER COACH SHARE THAT WHEN HE OVER HEARD A DISRESPECTFUL DISCUSSION IN THE LOCKER ROOM HE WAS PROUD TO HEAR ANOTHER STUDENT CHIME IN TO SAY THAT HEY WE SHOULD BE SAYING THAT STUFF. NOW WHENEVER I TELL PEOPLE ABOUT COACHING BOYS INTO MEN THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT'S AWESOME FOR THE BOYS. WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS? IT WAS REALLY HARD TO FIND FUNDING TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH GIRLS. WE HAD A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS AND PLANS AND WE HAD THE PERFECT INFRASTRUCTURE. BECAUSE WE WERE ALREADY SET UP TO DO THE SAME WORK WITH BOYS THEIR COACHING BOYS INTO MEN. BUT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY IS NOT A LOT OF FUNDING OUT THERE FOR PREVENTION. PREVENTION CAN BE HARDER TO UNDERSTANDING GRAB HOLD OF THEM WHAT FOLKS ARE USED TO FUNDING. WHICH IS HOW TO INTERVENE AFTER THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE. AS A SOCIETY WERE OFTEN MUCH BETTER AT HELPING OUT AFTER THE FACT. WHAT SAVE THE DAY FOR US FINALLY WAS THE FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION GRANT FOR THE FX GRANT FROM CALLOW YES THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES? I'M EXTREMELY HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT WE ARE NOW ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM FOR HIGH SCHOOL AGE GIRLS. CALL ATHLETES AS LEADERS. THAT WAS DESIGNED AS THE COMPANION PROGRAM TO COACHING BOYS INTO MEN. AND EVEN THOUGH THAT GRANT JUST STARTED WE ALREADY HAVE A GIRLS VOLLEYBALL TEAM AND A ROLLER DERBY TEAM. ON BOARD TO IMPLEMENT THE ATHLETES AS LEADERS PROGRAM. WE'RE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THIS FUNDING AND FOR THE FORESIGHT AND A COMMITMENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT HAS MADE THIS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE SIMPLY COULD NOT DO THIS WORK WITHOUT THIS FUNDING FROM CALLOW YES. AND THAT'S ANOTHER LESSON THAT I LEARNED IN MY TIME AT CDC. I LEARNED THAT STATE FUNDING IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION EFFORTS. WITHOUT THESE FUNDS THERE IS JUST A VERY LITTLE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND PARTICULARLY FOR SEXUAL AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION. EVEN THAT GREAT CDC FUNDING WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT HERE TODAY WHICH IS WONDERFUL. IS LESS THAN SIX MILLION DOLLARS NATIONWIDE. IT ONLY FUNDS TEN STATES. AND WE'RE LUCKY THAT CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF THEM. BUT EACH OF THOSE TEN STATES ARE LIMITED TO WORKING WITH THAT FUNDING IN ONLY TWO COMMUNITIES. SO THAT FUNDING IS A GREAT START. BUT IT'S NOT AND REALLY NOT INTENDED TO BE. ALL ENCOMPASSING AND I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT LATER IF YOU LIKE -- BUT YOU KNOW OFTEN IT'S EASIER FOR FUNDERS TO UNDERSTAND. PAYING FOR NIGHTS AT THE SHELTER FOR CHILD CARE YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS THAT FEEL MORE IMMEDIATE AND FEEL MORE TANGIBLE. AND I REALLY UNDERSTAND PERSONALLY WHY IT FEELS GOOD TO FUND THOSE THINGS AND THOSE THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY VITAL -- BUT AS WE LOOK DOWN THE ROAD. IF WE WANT TO REACH A DAY WHERE WE NO LONGER HAVE TO FIND SHELTERS. TO A FUTURE WHERE NO ONE HAS TO LEAVE HOME BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING TERRORIZED BY SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS TO LOVE THEM. WE HAVE TO INVEST NOW IN PREVENTION. FUNDING PREVENTION IS A SMART LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND IT IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR CHILDREN. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IN OUR FUTURE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ME QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES MISSED THE TRAINERS. SIR COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE AND I THINK WE WE KNOW THAT. PREVENTION IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN CARE YET YOUR TIME AND AGAIN IN ISSUE AFTER ISSUE WE DON'T INVEST IN PREVENTION WE WAIT FOR THERE TO BE A CRISIS -- SIX THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE HAD SOME VERY EXCITING SUCCESS APPRECIATE AND IN PARTICULAR I THINK YOUR EVIDENCE. I YOUR EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH. SAID YOU'RE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN TO COMMUNITIES ARE THAT THE FUNDING THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW. IS SUFFICIENT FOR YOU TO OPERATE IN TO COMMUNITIES. WE'RE IN TWO HIGH SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH OUR COACHING BOYS INTO MEN PROGRAM AND WE'RE LOOKING TO ADD MORE HIGH SCHOOLS TO THAT. AND THEN WE HAVE OUR ATHLETES AS LEADERS PROGRAM STARTED MORE RECENTLY BECAUSE THAT'S A GRANT THAT JUST STARTED FOR US -- AND THAT'S THE ONE THROUGH THE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THAT'S THE PROGRAM FOR THE FEMALE IDENTIFIED ATHLETES -- AND THROUGH THAT WE HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL HIGH SCHOOL -- WHERE WILL BE DOING THE GIRLS VOLLEYBALL AND THEN A NON HIGH SCHOOL SETTING WHICH IS THE ROLLER DERBY? AND HAVE YOU. THOUGHT AT ALL ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE. TO EXPAND THAT. OF COURSE OF COURSE YEAH WE OKAY I THINK ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME -- WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT -- IN TERMS OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IT SORT OF JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET -- WITH THE WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDING THE CDC FUNDING WE DO HOPE TO EXPAND TO MORE SCHOOLS HOPING TO EVENTUALLY GET. TO FIVE FOR THE MALE IDENTIFIED ATHLETES AND THAT -- WITH THE ATHLETES AS LEADERS I DON'T I DON'T KNOW YET WHAT THAT HOLDS BECAUSE IT'S STILL A NEWER PROCESS BUT I MEAN YOU THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS IN ANY GIVEN COMMUNITY. AND OF COURSE IT WOULD TAKE A LOT MORE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY REACH ALL THE SCHOOLS THAT AND ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT PREVENTION IS THAT -- YOU HAVE. TO REALLY GET IN THERE AND SORT OF GO DEEP WE CAN'T SORT OF SPRINKLE IT DOWN FROM THE DISTRICT LEVEL WE HAVE TO GO INTO THE SCHOOLS WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE COACHES WHO THEN. WORK WITH THE ATHLETES AND SO -- UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NOT A SORT OF BROAD. TOP DOWN THING THAT WE CAN DO IT REALLY IS A MATTER. OF GOING INTO EACH SCHOOL. AND WORKING WITH THOSE COACHES IN WITH THOSE TEAMS TO CHANGE THAT CULTURE WITH THE HOPE THAT. THE COACHES ARE INFLUENCERS FOR THE ATHLETES THE ATHLETES ARE INFLUENCERS FOR THEIR PEERS AND THAT IT SPREADS THAT WAY. AND BEYOND. HELP WITH SECURING FUNDING ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. AS LEGISLATORS THAT COULD HELP YOU AMPLIFY THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THAT'S WONDERFUL -- AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT BEFORE WE GOT HERE THAT -- YES WE TALK ABOUT AGING INFLUENTIAL ADULTS AND YOU ALL ARE CERTAINLY SOME INFLUENTIAL ADULTS -- ANOTHER COMPONENT OF OUR OF OUR WORK IS ASKING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. WHO ARE SEEN AS LEADERS IN THE COMMUNITY WHETHER THEY BE FAITH LEADERS WHETHER THEY BE -- YOU KNOW BUSINESS PEOPLE WHAT WHATEVER SECTOR THERE FROM -- TO STAND WITH US AND TO HELP CREATE THIS COMMUNITY WHERE WE SAY WE DON'T TOLERATE. THIS VIOLENCE AND WE DON'T TOLERATE THE TYPES OF WORDS OR ACTIONS THAT PROMOTE AND SUPPORT A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER ARM OF OUR PREVENTION WORK. AND AS WE LOOK TO WHO ARE THOSE INFLUENTIAL ADULTS THAT NOT JUST KIDS LOOK TO BUT THAT OTHER ADULTS LOOK. TO I CERTAINLY SEE A ROLE FOR LEGISLATORS LEGISLATORS VERY POWERFUL IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND HERE. AT THE STATE LEVEL -- THERE'S CERTAINLY A ROLE FOR LEGISLATORS TO HELP US BE THAT VOICE TO SAY. THIS IS WHAT. THIS IS THE KIND OF PLACE I WANT THIS COUNTY TO BE THIS COMMUNITY TO BE THIS TOWN TO BE IN THE STATE TO BE. A PLATE YOU KNOW WEEK WE CAN LEAD THE COUNTRY. IN TERMS OF NOT TOLERATING VIOLENCE IN TERMS OF OF PROMOTING HEALTHY RELATIONS WAS REALLY UNDERSTANDING. AT A DEEP LEVEL WHAT THAT MEANS A LIVING. SO I THINK THERE'S A GREAT ROLE THERE AND THAT IS. SEPARATE FROM THE WHOLE FUNDING QUESTION IN A LOT OF THAT. LEGISLATORS CAN DO FOR FREE RIGHT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OKAY THANK YOU BRITTANY. GOOD MORNING OUT PROCESS ON YES GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN WOMAN RUBIO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE AND SOME IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO PREVENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACROSS THE STATE. MY NAME IS VIRGINIA DUE PROCESS AND I'M A PROJECT DIRECTOR ON THE HEALTH TEAM OUT FUTURES WITHOUT VIOLENCE WE'RE A NATIONAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL JUSTICE NONPROFIT BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH ONE SIMPLE MISSION. TO HEAL THOSE AMONG US WHO ARE TRAUMATIZED BY VIOLENCE TODAY AND TO CREATE HEALTHY FAMILIES. FREE OF VIOLENCE TOMORROW. OUR GROUND BREAKING PROGRAMS POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLIC ACTION CAMPAIGNS ARE DESIGNED TO PREVENT AN AND VIOLENCE AROUND THE WORLD. STRIVING TO REACH AUDIENCES AND TRANSFORM SOCIAL NORMS WE TRAINED PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS DOCTORS NURSES JUDGES AND ATHLETIC COACHES ON TAKING ACTION TO ADDRESS VIOLENCE AND ABUSE. WE ALSO WORK WITH ADVOCATES POLICYMAKERS AND OTHERS TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATE PEOPLE EVERYWHERE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF RESPECT AND HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. IN ADDITION TO MY OVER FIFTEEN YEAR CAREER AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE I COME TO YOU AS A SURVIVOR. AND AS A MOTHER OF A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. I'M COMMITTED TO PREVENTION WITH THE HOPE THAT OTHERS IN MY FAMILY AND COMMUNITY. NEVER HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THE FEAR ISOLATION AND SHAME THAT WERE PART OF MY STORY. BUT OF COURSE PREVENTION CAN BE DONE BY ONE PERSON OR EVEN BY ONE ORGANIZATION NO MATTER HOW COMMITTED WE ARE. EACH AND EVERYONE OF US HAS A YOU HAS A UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT ROLE IN PREVENTING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. TODAY I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT A FEW OF THE STRATEGIES THAT FUTURES WITHOUT VIOLENCE HAS DEVELOPED AND THAT WE SUPPORTED -- COMMUNITIES IN IMPLEENTING. SO COACHING BOYS INTO MEN AND ATHLETES AS LEADERS ARE TWO OF OUR PROGRAMS -- IN ADDITION TO HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS COACHING BOYS INTO MEN IS ALSO BEING PILOTED AT UC BERKELEY WITH THREE SPORTS TEAMS. WE KNOW THAT SPORTS CAN BE AN IMPORTANT VEHICLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE AND HAVE DEVELOPED A PARTNERSHIP WITH MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL. EACH SPRING FUTURE STAFF HEADS TO FLORIDA AND ARIZONA TO PROVIDE WORKSHOPS FOR EVERY MLB TEAM'S FORTY MAN ROSTER WITH AN EMPHASIS ON PREVENTION AND BUILDING HEALTHY. PASSED UP POSITIVE BYSTANDER. AT BEHAVIORS WHETHER IT'S INTERRUPTING SEXIST JOKES IN THE LOCKER ROOM OR HOW TO SAFELY INTERVENE IF THEY WITNESS A PHYSICAL ALTERCATION. WE KNOW THAT CHANGE TAKES TIME BUT OVER THE FIVE YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL WE'VE SEEN THE CULTURE SHIFTING. PLAYERS WHO ARE IN OUR VERY FIRST TRAININGS FIVE YEARS AGO ARE NOW ACTING AS MENTORS AND SUPPORT TO NEWER PLAYERS MAKING SURE THAT THE NEW PLAYERS TAKE THE WORKSHOP SERIOUSLY. AND HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE TO HIGH STANDARDS OF EQUITY AND RESPECT. BUT WE'RE MORE THAN JUST SPORTS. OUR ORGANIZATION ACTUALLY STARTED OFF AS A TINY OFFICE IN THE BASEMENT OF SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL WHERE WE SUPPORTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WHO ARE COMING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. SINCE THEN WE'VE EXPANDED TO A NATIONAL PROGRAM THAT IT INCLUDES RESEARCH TRAINING AND RESOURCES FOR A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. IN FACT FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN THE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED NATIONAL RESOURCE CENTER ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND RECENTLY BECAME A PARTNER IN THE BOND. OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER FOR AT THE CDC. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE LED THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HEALTHCARE PARTNERSHIP WHICH WAS FUNDED BY BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION. INCLUDED NINETEEN CLINICS FROM ACROSS THE STATE THAT PARTNERED WITH THEIR LOCAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS TO BETTER PREVENT AND RESPOND TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WERE TRAINED ON HOW TO TALK WITH ALL OF THEIR PATIENTS ABOUT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ON ADVOCACY RESOURCES. SO INSTEAD OF JUST ASKING A SCREENING QUESTION LIKE HAVE YOU ARE YOU BEING HURT BY A PARTNER. PROVIDERS IN THIS INITIATIVE ACTUALLY STARTED WITH CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CONSENT RESPECT AND RELATIONSHIP SAFETY. BOTH ARE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA SHOW IMPROVEMENTS FOR BOTH THE PROVIDERS AND THE PATIENT'S. PROVIDERS FELT MORE CONFIDENT TALKING ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION. AND PATIENTS FELT MORE SUPPORTED BY THEIR PROVIDERS. MANY PATIENTS SHARED THAT THE INTERACTION WITH THEIR PROVIDER WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT ANYONE IN THEIR LIVES HAD TALKED TO THEM ABOUT WHAT. HEALTHY AND SAFE RELATIONSHIP MIGHT LOOK LIKE WHAT THEY DESERVED. AND HOW THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED IN A RELATIONSHIP AND THEY ALSO SHARED THAT THEY WERE TAKING THE INFORMATION BACK TO THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THIS IS WHERE WE SEE THE INCREDIBLE RIPPLE EFFECT OF PREVENTION WORK. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TALKING WITH PATIENTS WHO IN THE END WHO IN TURN BRING THESE IMPORTANT PREVENTION MESSAGES BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE'VE ALSO SEEN GREAT REGIONAL LEADERSHIP EMERGE SO THE CLINICS IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE LOS ANGELES AREA CONTINUE TO MEET AS A TASK FORCE. FOCUSED ON PREVENTION WORK EVEN THOUGH THERE GRANT FUNDING HAS ENDED AND I DID MY LITTLE GOOGLE SEARCH WHILE FOLKS WERE SPEAKING AND I KNOW THAT. LOT OF THESE CLINICS IN TV PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT -- SOME FOLKS ON THIS COMMITTEE SERVICE SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE IN TOUCH WITH THEM TO TALK MORE ABOUT THEIR WORK. WORK PLACES ARE ANOTHER FORM OF COMMUNITY WE SPEND MORE TIME WORKING THAN ON ANY OTHER WAKING ACTIVITY SO THE WORKPLACE PRESENTS A CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR PREVENTION. FUTURES WITHOUT VIOLENCE IS ALSO HOME TO WORK PLACES RESPOND TO DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND NATIONAL RESOURCE CENTER. WHICH IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP FUNDED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. EMPLOYEE AND SUPERVISOR TRAINING PROGRAMS AWARENESS RAISING ACTIVITIES AND WORKPLACE VIOLENCE POLICIES ARE JUST SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT WORKPLACE STAKEHOLDERS CAN UTILIZE TO IMPLEMENT PROACTIVE MULTI STAKEHOLDER PROGRAMS THAT NOT ONLY RESPOND TO THE IMPACTS OF VIOLENCE. BUT WORK TOWARD PREVENTING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. JUL SUCH AS ONE CALL CHECK YOUR WORKPLACE ENCOURAGE ORGANISATIONS TO START CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PREVENTION AND GETTING INPUT FROM WORKERS AT ALL LEVELS. TO HELP CREATE A CULTURE OF SAFETY AND RESPECT. AND OF COURSE BEFORE ANY OF US AND TO THE WORKPLACE WE HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL. SO FUTURES WITHOUT VIOLENCE HAS HELPED CREATE PREVENTION PROGRAMS FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD. K. TO TWELVE AND COLLEGE CAMPUS SETTINGS -- SO FROM PRESCHOOL TO PHD WE HAVE EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES THAT CAN PREVENT VIOLENCE BEFORE IT OCCURS. FOR EXAMPLE ON OUR WORK WITH HEAD STARTS. WE'VE CREATED RESOURCES FOR TEACHERS AND STAFF TO TALK WITH ALL CARE GIVERS ABOUT HEALTHY AND SAFE RELATIONSHIPS. FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL WE HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED START STRONG THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS PROVIDES TOOLS FOR PARENTS TO TALK TO THEIR KIDS ABOUT DATING. RELATIONSHIPS RESPECT AND HEALTHY FRIENDSHIPS. ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES WE CAN BE LEADERSHIP INSTITUTES FOR STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF TO CREATE COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION PLANS. AND ALTHOUGH WE BRING OUR OWN TOOLS BUILT ON YEARS OF RESEARCH AND ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE WE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE COMMUNITIES TO ADAPT THEM TO MEET THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS AND STRENGTHS. PREVENTION IS POSSIBLE VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA ARE NOT INEVITABLE PARTS OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE CONCRETE STRATEGIES TO HELP INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES AROUND TO KEEP DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HOPE THIS COMMITTEE WILL HELP CREATE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPLEMENT THEM ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. LIKE THAT OUT FROM FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL OPEN IT UP FOR OUR FOR ABOVE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT AGAIN IF YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION TO US AND THAT WE WILL DISTRIBUTE IT TO THE COMMITTEE -- I'M INTERESTED IN YOU KNOW THE THE PROGRAMS. FOR ALL ALL SCHOOL AGE KIDS BY -- SPECIFICALLY ARE THE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS I THINK WE TALKED TOUCH. WE TOUCHED ON IT EARLIER ABOUT -- SOME TEENS THINK THAT -- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS -- OR VIOLENCE IS JUST INTO MY PARTNERS BUT WE THAT CYCLE STARTS WITH -- UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS JUST WITH FRIENDS AND SO I THINK THAT IF WE CAN FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON ON THAT TYPE OF TRAINING FOR OUR STUDENTS ARE FOR KIDS. THEN THE WILL LEARN THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT AND NOT GET INTO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIPS -- WITH INTIMATE PARTNER SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE -- THE PANEL IN THE WALL OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT -- AND THEN -- HOPEFULLY WE CAN. AND WITH SOME TOOLS AND SOME INFORMATION GATHERING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SOME OF THESE -- QUESTIONS AND POLICIES AND TO ACTUAL REALITY THANK YOU.
