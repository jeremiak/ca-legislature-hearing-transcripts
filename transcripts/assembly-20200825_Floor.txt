THIS MORNING THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE BIG THREE NETWORKS REPORTED UPDATED SURVEY AND BIG BASS AND STATE PARK. CALIFORNIA'S OLDEST. REVEALS MOST OF ITS TREES HAVE SURVIVED THE FIRES. THOSE WORDS SOME OF WHOSE TREES WERE YOUNG AT THE TIME OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. WE'RE NOISY WITH LIVE YESTERDAY WAS SQUAWKING STELLAR JAYS AND INDUSTRIOUS WOODPECKERS. THIS NEW NOTWITHSTANDING CALIFORNIA FOR SOME OR ALL OF OUR MINDS TODAY. AND IT IS RIGHT THAT THEY SHOULD BE TRUE. THREE SEVEN UNDENIABLE MAJESTY. A DECADE AFTER BIG BASS WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN OH TWO. THE AMERICAN POET JOYCE KILMER GANDER MORTALITY WHEN HE WROTE. I THINK THAT I SHALL NEVER SEE A POEM LOVELY AS A TREE. TREES WHETHER ABOUNDED ON A HILLSIDE OR MAGNIFICENT WITH THE LOVELINESS OF A LOAN SILHOUETTE. ARE THE WORK OF YEARS. THEY ARE SCOLDED ACCORDING TO THE WINDS TO BLOW THROUGH THEM. THOSE WINDS ARE INVISIBLE. BUT THEY LEFT THE MOVE BRANCHES AS A TIME WHEN AMONG THEM. PUSHING IN SHAPING EACH BALLOT BUT AS THEY GROW. EACH NEEDLE RELIEF MUST ADAPT TO THE WINS OR BE CARRIED AWAY. THE TRUCKS THEMSELVES GROW IN BULK TO SUPPORT THE LIVING AND GROWING BRANCHES. A HILLSIDE OF CALIFORNIA TREES IS A METAPHOR FOR THE DYNAMISM OF LIFE. AND JUST LIKE TO MARTINEZ TREES IN THE FOREST. AMERICAN DEMOCRACY SINCE ITS FOUNDING. HAS GROWN AND BEEN SHAPED BY THE INSISTENT AND FAR REACHING CURRENTS. OF WE THE PEOPLE. AND IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION. BECAUSE OUR DEMOCRACY IS DERIVED FROM THE LIVES AND DREAMS OF OUR PEOPLE. THIS POSSIBILITY OF GROWTH HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN. INDEED THIS POSSIBLE OUR GROWTH IS INSEPARABLE FROM OUR HUMANITY. MATTHEW HENSON THE FRAME AFRICAN AMERICAN ARCTIC EXPLORER SAID AT THE START OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. LIFE IS GROWTH MY FIRST PROGRESS AND PROGRESS DEPENDS ON NEW IDEAS. WITHOUT THE ADVENT OF NEW IDEAS WE SHOULD STILL BE RIDING STAGE COACH AND READING BY THE LIGHT OF TALLOW CANDLES. GREAT IDEAL SAID REPREHENSIBLE THE GLORY OF MANAL. NO OTHER CREATURE CAN HAVE THEM. ONLY MAN CAN GET A VISION AND INSPIRATION THAT WILL LIFT HIM ABOVE THE LEVEL OF HIMSELF. AND SENT HIM FORTH AGAINST ALL OPPOSITION IN ANY DISCOURAGED. TO DO AND TO DARE AND A COP WITH WONDERFUL AND GREAT THINGS FOR THE WORLD FOR HUMANITY. FURTHER IN THE HOLE OPEN POSSIBILITIES OF OUR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS VERY CLEARLY THE WORK OF OUR DAY. IT IS A POSITIVE WORK TO THWART THE IMPULSE OF TURNING. TWO BOTTLE DECENCY AND RESPECTFUL COLLABORATION AND HUMAN PROGRESS. AND KEEP FAITH WITH THE VISION OF OUR NATION'S FOUNDERS AND ITS CONSTITUTION. THIS WEEK WE CONTINUE THAT WORK. LET ME SEVERAL WE ARE DONE THEN ON OUR DAY. THE TREE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY GREW TALL AND STRONG. AMID THE BLOWING WINDS OF CHANGE SHOULD PROSPER. AS A REFUGE OF LIES. AND THE SOUNDS OF VIBRANT LIFE. AND DID NOT BECOME A SILENT AND EMPTY RELIC.

THANK YOU MR SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY I'M PROUD 2% SB EIGHTY SIX ON BEHALF OF SENATOR ALSO I'M ALSO A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION THE BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION TO SUBMIT QUARTERLY REPORTS TO LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES AND THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL ON THE USE OF GRANULAR PRODUCTS APPLY PARA FOSS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR STATE CONTINUES TO ALLOW THE USE OF CHLORPYRIFOS IN GRANULAR FORM IN SPITE OF SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDING THE GRANULAR FORM PRESENTS A WRISTER ARMWORKERS CHILDREN AND MOTHERS FARMWORKERS ARE AT RISK FROM THESE PRODUCTS WHEN THEY MIX UNLOAD AND APPLY THE PRODUCT WORKERS ARE VULNERABLE TO HARM THROUGH EXPOSURE TO SKIN AND INHALATION EXPOSURE EVEN WHEN THEY FOLLOW THE LABEL INSTRUCTIONS AND WEAR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. CLICK FOSSE'S ARE A CUTELY. AND ASSOCIATED WITH IN ORDER KNURLED MEN HARM IN CHILDREN. CHILDREN CAN BE EXPOSED TO THIS BRAIN DAMAGING PESTICIDE IN VARIOUS WAYS INCLUDING WHEN THEIR PARENTS OR SIBLINGS BRING THE PESTICIDE INTO THE HOME. ON THEIR SKIN CLOTHING AND SHOES. PRENATAL AND EARLY LIFE EXPOSURE TO CHLORPYRIFOS IS ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED RISKS OF REDUCE IQ. LOSS OF WORKING MEMORY DELAYS IN MOTOR DEVELOPMENT ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE BRAIN. AS LONG AS CALIFORNIA ALLOWS ANY TYPE OF THIS PRODUCT INCLUDING GRANULAR PRODUCT REMAIN IN USE. FARMWORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WILL SHOULDER ANOTHER RISK TO THEIR HEALTH. NOW THIS IS NOT A BAN ON THIS PRODUCT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO STATE. THIS IS A DATA COLLECTION BILL THE NOT DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING WILL HELP PROVIDE MEANINGFUL TOOLS THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE USE AND THE IMPACT OF THESE PRODUCTS ON THIS POPULATION. FOR US TO IT'S GONNA RESPONSIBILITY TO AT LEAST MONITOR THE USE OF THE PRODUCTS AND MONITOR THE EFFECT IT HAS ON THIS POPULATION OF HIS PEOPLE AND CHILDREN WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE. THIS WORK IS NOT BE BEING DONE NOW. AND WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF WHAT WE KNOW TO BE A DANGEROUS CHEMICAL WITHOUT AYE URGENT AYE VOTE. THANK OF A THREE MISTER. HERE RECOMMENDS THANK YOU MISTER STE MEMBER. BUDGET CUTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND- ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT THE FINDINGS OF THIS BILL- WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A DANGEROUS CHEMICAL. BUT THE FACT IS WHEN. CHLORPYRIFOS IS USED IN THE PALLETIZED GRANULAR. FORM THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WHICH WE ALLOW IT IN CALIFORNIA THE FILTER THEN SHUT DOWN. THEY SAY DO NOT ENTER THE LET THE WORKERS KNOW THEY LET EVERYBODY KNOW SO WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN YOU GET YOUR HOUSE BLOG IN THE PUT THE TEN OVER IT. SO TO SAY. THAT WORKERS ARE ARE CARRYING THIS BACK IN THEIR HOMES IT IS BASICALLY CALLING THE WORKERS AND CONFIDENT WHICH WE ALL KNOW ISN'T TRUE. BECAUSE THERE ARE MEASURES TAKEN. STEPS PUT IN PLACE. ALL THIS BILL IS DOING. IS GOING AFTER IN USING. DEFINITIONS OF SPRAY PRACTICES WHICH WE NO LONGER DO. THIS BILL IS GOING TO COST THE STATE MONEY DURING A TIME OF RECESSION I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER VOTING NO WERE LAYING OFF AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THERE WAS MATHIS MR STONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS COOPER FOSTER IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS CHEMICAL. I WISH WE WERE BANNING IT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF RISK IT ACTUALLY REPRESENTS NOT JUST TO THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE FARMWORKERS IN PEOPLE ON IN THOSE FIELDS BY THE DAMAGE THEY CAN DO IN THOSE THOSE COMMUNITIES AROUND. THAT THE FEELS LIKE IN MY DISTRICT WHERE IT IT IS BEING USED THIS IS REALLY SCARY STUFF THIS BILL IS A MINOR BILL THAT IS LOOKING TO COLLECT DATA AND HELPING THE STATE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND IN MANAGER PRODUCT LIKE THIS AND I HIGHLY REQUEST THAT THAT WEPASS THIS TO GET THE INFORMATION WE NEED WE NEED WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS NOW- OR WE'RE GONNA LOSE GROUND. IN ENSURING THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA ASKS FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK MISSION STONES SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM IS FRIEDMAN YOU MAY CLOSE. YES I WANT TO THANK. MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE DEBATE ON THIS BILL THIS BILL IS A COMPROMISE MEASURE. THERE ARE THOSE OF US WHO ORIGINALLY WOULD HAVE LIKE TO SEE A BAN N THIS PESTICIDE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A MEASURE SO THAT A STOP GAP MEASURES SO THAT. THE OTHER SIDE THE USERS CAN SHOW THAT THE CHEMICAL IS SAFE BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SAFE OR NOT IF WE'RE NOT MONITORING HOW IT'S USED. AND WHAT THE RESULT IS ON THESE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT ARE IMPACTED. AND YEAH IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IN A PERFECT WORLD WITH ALL PERFECT PRECAUTIONS THIS CHEMICAL WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE BUT WE KNOW THAT IT IS. WE KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING INTO GROUNDWATER WE KNOW THAT IT'S GETTING INTO WATER WE KNOW THAT THERE'S RESIDUE. I'M REMAINING ON FOOD PRODUCTS WE KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN IMPACTING THE POPULATION OF INSECTS AND POLLINATORS. SO WE NEED TO HAVE THE DATA TO REALLY SHOW THE LINK BETWEEN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT OCCURRENCES AND THAT MEANS THIS VERY SIMPLE BILL. THAT REQUIRES THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND REPORTING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WITHOUT AYE ORIGIN AYE VOTE. AND WITH THAT CORPORATE THE ROLE. HE SAID ABOUT ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF VOTE.

THAT CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE SENT TO THE SITES THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TEAM REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VENUE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARTIST. AS OPPOSED TO BEING TRUE EASILY PULLED OUT TO OTHER VENDORS THAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO HAVE A SITE THAT GIVES PEOPLE ACCESS TO OTHER TICKETS THAT THAT FINE THAT'S THIS IS NOT GOING AGAINST THAT.

DUPED LIKE THIS IT ACTUALLY HURTS THE VENUE IT HURTS THE ARTIST IT HURTS THE SPORTS TEAM JUST SO SOMEONE ELSE CAN LINE THEIR POCKETS THIS IS A GOOD BILL THIS IS CONSUMER PROTECTION IT IS APPROPRIATE.
