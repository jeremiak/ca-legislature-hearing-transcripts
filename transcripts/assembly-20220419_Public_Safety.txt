FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF TO REFINE AND FORM THE AMENDMENTS FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL WHICH I AM ACCEPTING. I AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE IS A BIPARTISAN BILL THAT ESTABLISHES THE CALIFORNIA FEDERAL ABUSE TASK FORCE THE TASK FORCE WILL COLLECT AND ORGANIZE DATA ON THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF FENNEL ABUSE AND EVALUATE APPROACHES TO TREAT AND PREVENT OVERDOSES AS WELL AS INCREASED PUBLIC AWARENESS OF FENNEL. THIS TASK FORCE'S MEMBERSHIP IS DIVERSE INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM NONPROFITS AND HEALTH AGENCIES. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES CALIFORNIA AND THE REST OF THE NATION HAVE SEEN A RISE IN OVERDOSES RELATED TO OPIOID USE. AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE BECOME WELL AWARE OF THIS. THE AT HOW THIS NEW WAVE OF DRUG DEATHS CAUSED BY FENTANYL AFFECTS CALIFORNIANS OF ALL DEMOGRAPHICS AND COMMUNITIES. COSTS IN LIVES OF ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE PHENYL OVERDOSE BECAME RECOGNIZED AS THE LEADING CAUSE. OF AMERICANS OF DEATH FOR AMERICANS AGED EIGHTEEN TO FORTY FIVE. AND THAT'S MORE THAN SUICIDE GUN HOMICIDE AND CAR ACCIDENTS. DATA FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT YIELDS OF THE BAY AREA ALONE HAD OVER TWENTY NINE THOUSAND GRAMS OF FENTANYL THAT WAS SEIZED IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. WHICH IS ENOUGH FATAL OVERDOSES TO KILL FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE. THE VALUE OF BRINGING TOGETHER A STATEWIDE TASK FORCE OF INDIVIDUALS ALREADY TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED AN EPIDEMIC OF THESE PROPORTIONS DESERVES A RESPONSE THAT BRINGS TOGETHER THE BEST OF OUR STATE'S RESOURCES. AB SEVENTEEN ARE SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE WILL ASSEMBLE THAT DATA AND INDIVIDUALS TO IDENTIFY THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO RESPOND TO THIS FORM OF SYNTHETIC OPIOID ABUSE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN OR THE CAPE TIBBETTS FACT WILL HELP PREVENT VIOLENT MURDERS AND ASSAULTS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO K. TO THIS LAST YEAR. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE SIXTY ONE YEAR OLD WAS LIVING ALONE WITH APPROPRIATE LARGE BROKE INTO A HOME ASSAULTED AND THEN MURDERED HER. IS ONE A PREDATOR ALSO KILLED BOTH CASE DOGS ATTEMPTED TO BURN DOWN A HOME TO CONCEAL HIS REFER CRIMES EARLY THAT EVENING BEFORE KATE'S MURDER OUR NEIGHBOR CALLED POLICE REPORTING A SUSPECT WHO IS STANDING ON THE PORT MANN. IN FOR THE DOOR CAMERA AT THAT TIME THE SUSPECT WAS ON PAROLE FOR THE VIOLENCE SERIOUS CRIMES OF ROBBERY AND ASSAULT WITH DEADLY WEAPON. HE WAS A TRANSIENT WAS IN VIOLATION OF HIS PAROLE FOR NOT CHECKING IN PRO HAD NO WAY TO CONTACT HIM EVEN KNOW HIS WHEREABOUTS. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON THREE VIOLENT OR SEXUAL PREDATOR PAROLE THE TO BE AT LARGE BECAUSE THEY ARE TRANSIENT AND REFUSED TO CHECK IN. UNFORTUNATELY IS ALSO NOT UNCOMMON FOR A VOTE IMPROVE THE POTENTIALLY VIOLATES THE CONDITIONS OF PAROLE NOT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND TO CONTINUE TO DO AS THEY PLEASE AND WONDER UNCHECKED. LET ME BE CLEAR. THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE PRO AGENTS THE FILLION SYSTEMS GIRLY FALLS UPON POOR POLICY BY THE CDC ARE HERE'S WHAT AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN DOES TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THE FIND A HIGH RISK FRAWLEY AS ONE HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF A VIOLENT CRIME FELONY SEXUAL OFFENSE OR SERIOUS FELONY LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR RIPPING OF A DISABLED PERSON. CREATES A MISDEMEANOR SAID AT THE COUNTY JAIL TIME NOT PRISON WITH A HIGH RISK POOL YOU FELT TO REPORT TO A PAROLE AGENT. RICARDO HIRES PEARLY WHO'S TRANSIENT TO BE FITTED WITH A MONITORING DEVICE UPON RELEASE FROM PRISON OR TILL THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED RESIDENCE. THIS GIVES TOTAL A FULL DISCRETION TO THE COURTS. NOT TO SUBJECT IT A HIGH RISK PROCEDURAL TIME TOTAL COURT DISCRETION. THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO THOSE WHO ARE ON PAROLE AFTER BEING CONVICTED OF A VIOLENT SERIOUS FELONY OR SEXUAL FELONY. HERE TODAY IS DENTED ITS CASE BROTHER AND ASK THE DOC IS. KATE'S FRIEND. THANK YOU HAVE FIVE FIVE MINUTES ALTOGETHER WHATEVER WAY YOU WANT TO SPLIT UP TWO AND A HALF MINUTES OR FOUR MINUTES TO ONE WHATEVER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRED COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU PULL THE MIGHT CLOSE AS WE CAN HERE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS DAN TIBBETTS ONE OF KATE'S BROTHERS MY BROTHER GEORGE IS ALSO HERE TODAY. ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER THIRD OF LAST YEAR MY SISTER MARY KATE TIBET'S WAS AT HER HOME IN THE LAND PARK COMMUNITY OF SACRAMENTO WHEN THE SUSPECT BROKE INTO HER HOME AND ASSAULTED AND MURDERED HER. HE ALSO KILLED HER TWO DOGS AND THEN SAID KATE'S HOUSE ON FIRE. MY SISTER WAS A GOOD PERSON A REGULAR VOLUNTEER FOR THE SPCA AND ALWAYS WORKED ELECTIONS. SHE BELIEVED IN THE CIVIC PROCESS AND BELIEVE THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WOULD ALWAYS DO THEIR BEST TO PROTECT SOCIETY. THE PERSON WHO KILLED MY SISTER VIOLATED HIS PAROLE HE FAILED TO APPEAR IN COURT FOR NEW CRIMES HE COMMITTED WHILE ON PAROLE AND HAD A WARRANT OUT FOR HIS ARREST AT THE TIME HE MURDERED KATE. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THIS PERSON WAS TRANSIENT PAROLE OFFICERS HAD NO MEANS TO BE ABLE TO FIND THIS PERSON TO ENSURE HE MET THE SIMPLE LIST STIPULATIONS OF HIS PAROLE. THEREFORE THE SYSTEM THAT QUE BELIEVED IN AND TRUSTED. DRASTICALLY FELT HER AND IT COST HER HER LIFE. MY SISTER'S MURDER HAD. HAS HAD PROFOUND IMPACTS TO NOT JUST MY FAMILY BUT TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. PRIOR TO KATE'S MURDER I FELT SAFE IN MY HOME. BECAUSE OF KATE'S MURDER AND THE NUMEROUS OTHER MURDERS AND VIOLENT CRIMES TAKING PLACE EACH WEEK IN OUR STATE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY NOTE NO LONGER FEEL SAFE FROM VIOLENT PREDATORS EVEN IN OUR OWN HOMES. LATELY ALL TOO OFTEN CONVICTED FELONS ARE BEING RELEASED EARLY FROM PRISON ON PAROLE. HER ROLE IS BASICALLY AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS GOVERNANCESYSTEM AND A VIOLENT CONDUCT THAT SAYS. OKAY YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF WHILE BEING INCARCERATED WILL LET YOU OUT EARLY AND CONTINUE TO SEE IF YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF. HOWEVER MANY TIMES HIGH RISK PAROLEES DO NOT BEHAVE THEMSELVES UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A VERY DEFICIENT STRUCTURE TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY INTENTIONALLY VIOLATE THEIR PAROLE. AND THIS IS EVEN MORE APPARENT IF THE PAROLE THE HAPPENS TO BE TRANSIENT. K. TIBBETTS ACT WOULD REQUIRE TRANSIENT HIGH RISK PAROLEES TO WEAR AN ANKLE MONITORING DEVICE SO THAT IF AND WHEN THEY VIOLATE PAROLE CONDITIONS THEY CAN SIMPLY BE LOCATED. HAD THE TRANSIENT PAROLEES WHO KILLED KATE BEEN REQUIRED TO HAVE THIS MONITORING DEVICE HER SENSELESS AND BRUTAL MURDER LIKELY WOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY THAT THIS VIOLATES THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE VIOLENT PAROLEES MY COUNTER TO THEM IS TWO FOLD FIRST THESE VIOLENT CONT THAT CONTACTS FORFEITED SOME OF THEIR RIGHTS WHEN THEY COMMITTED THEIR CRIMES THAT LED TO THEIR INCARCERATION IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND SECOND WHAT ABOUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF VICTIMS LIKE KATE. ARE WE AS A SOCIETY PUTTING THE FORFEITED RIGHTS OF CONVICTED FELONS THE HEAD OF THE RIGHTS OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS TAXPAYERS AND CONSTITUENTS OF THE STATE. THEREFORE I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE CAPE TIBBETTS ACT AND A VOTE FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU SIR. YES WE CAN SO WE CAN HEAR YOU. YOU CAN PUT CLOSER. NOT TO TOUCH IT. WELL MISTER. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY MY NAME IS ANSWERED ACCESS AND I'M TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND AS TO WHY. AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN IS NAMED AFTER IN HONOR OF KATE TIBBETTS I MET KATE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WHEN WE ARE BOTH BUSINESS STUDENTS AT CAL STATE SACRAMENTO. WE QUICKLY BUILT A CLOSE FRIENDSHIP AND THE NEXT ACADEMIC YEAR BECAME ROOMMATES OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWELVE YEARS KATE AND I WOULD SHARE FOUR DIFFERENT HOMES IN SACRAMENTO AND THE EAST BAY WITH ONLY A FEW SHORT BREAKS DUE TO EDUCATION OR EMPLOYMENT. AS KATE AND I EACH BECAME HOMEOWNERS WE LIVE SEPARATELY BUT CONTINUE OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP IN FACT I REFERRED TO KATE AS MY SECOND SISTER INSTEAD OF A BEST FRIEND OF WHICH KATE HAD TOO MANY TO COUNT. OVER THE PAST FORTY THREE YEARS KATE CELEBRATED MY SUCCESSES AND SUPPORTED ME THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES INCLUDING THE DEATH OF MY BLOOD RELATED SISTER FROM CANCER FIVE YEARS AGO. WHEN KATE ABOUT HER LAN PER COMMON TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I WAS HAPPY THAT SHE WAS MOVING TO A SAFER NEIGHBORHOOD THEN- PRIOR HOUSE NOW I KNOW BETTER NO NEIGHBORHOOD IS SAFE IN SACRAMENTO OR EVEN CALIFORNIA. ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER THIRD KAY WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED AFTER TREY DAVIS A VIOLENT OFFENDER BROKE INTO HER HOME DAVIS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN RELEASED FROM CUSTODY ON TO THE STREETS OF SACRAMENTO WITH NO PLACE TO LIVE. AND IN FACT DAVIS HAVE BEEN RECORDED PERFORMING SEXUAL ACTS ON INDOOR SECURITY CAMERA EARLIER THAT DAY. A CONCERN LAND PARK RESIDENT CONTACTED THE POLICE WHO PUT A HELICOPTER IN THE AIR LOOKING FOR DAVIS LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS FORCED TO SUSPEND THE SEARCH WHEN DAVIS COULD NOT BE LOCATED. IN MY OPINION WE HAVE NOT GIVEN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ENOUGH TOOLS TO DO THEIR JOB HAD THE PROVISIONS OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN THE KATE TIPPETT'S ACT BEEN IN PLACE DAVIS COULD NOT COULD HAVE BEEN LOCATED AND KATE SENSELESS MURDER COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. IT IS SIMPLY NOT OKAY FOR A LOT OF. WOMEN LIVING ALONE TO PUT AT RISK IN FAVOR OF VIOLENT OFFENDERS RIGHTS. WHEN A VIOLENT OR SEXUAL OFFENDERS RELEASED FROM PRISON A MONITORING DEVICE SEEMS LIKE A SIMPLE SOLUTION FOR THOSE RELEASED WITH OUR- AND ESTABLISH A- IT ALLOWS. WHO HAVE EARNED EARLY RELEASE CREDITS TO RE. SOCIETY WITH AN APPROPRIATE MECHANISM AND MAINTAINING CONTACT WITH THEIR PAROLE AGENTS. AND WITH OTHER SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOCUS ON TRUE REHABILITATION WHILE ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY. AB EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN ENCOURAGES CONTINUED COMPLIANCE PROVIDE. BY PROVIDING CONSEQUENCES FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS.

SERVICES TO CURRENTLY IN PREVIOUS INCARCERATED PEOPLE INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE IN RE ENTRY- IS BILLS- THAT SEEKS TO PLACE LIKE TOM MINERS ON PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERED HIGH RISK FRAWLEY'S AND HELPLESS- WE KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A HOUSE THIS THIS PROBLEM IS SYSTEMIC. IT IMPACTS MANY PEOPLE FROM MANY DEMOGRAPHICS ACROSS CALIFORNIA- D. D. BEING HOUSES I'M SORRY ADDITIONALLY PEOPLE WITHOUT HOMES HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME ACCESSING PLACES RIGHT LET TRICITY THAT'S SETTING AT SETTING THEM UP FOR NON CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS- ADD THAT. THERE'S LITTLE DIFFERENCE FROM HIGH RISKS AND HIGH NEEDS PEOPLE ON PAROLE AS SOMEBODY WHO WORKS WITH PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THIS FIELD. A LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN HOW WE DO THAT ASSESSMENT- AT HOUSELESS PEOPLE- FOR ALREADY FACE A MERE READ A SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES AND MORE BARRIERS TO THE NON SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION ONLY COMPOUNDS IN EXISTING ISSUE FORM ELECTRONIC INCARCERATION A CONTINUES AT THE PRISON SYSTEM LONG AFTER PERSONS RELEASED- AND I'LL ADD THAT THERE'S ALREADY PROVISIONS WITHIN WITH WITHIN THIS LAW THAT I A AND THAT'S RARELY AVAILABLE- TO BE PLACED PEOPLE WANDER ELECTRONIC MONITORING BY AT THE BORDER PRO HEARINGS. THE COURT AND INCLUDING THE SUPERVISING- PRO AGENTS- AND SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS JUST MAKE A BLANKET I'M BILL THAT WOULD PUT EVERYBODY WHO IS CONSIDERED HIGH RISK FOR ALL ON ELECTRONIC MONITORING WHEN THEY BECOME HOUSE THIS- AND I'LL FINISH IT WOULD WANT ONE MORE THING- WHEN I PAROLED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. THIS BILL WOULD. ME THE SHORT. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU- MY NAME IS MARCO GEORGIAN I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN- FIRST I WANT TO SAY TO THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF KATE I'M REALLY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU- BUT AB TWENTY. EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN IS NOT A SOLUTION TO PAROLEES BEING HOMELESS OR RE OFFENDING. INSTEAD IT'S A JOB CREATION PROGRAM FOR MORE PAROLE OFFICERS AND MORE LAWYERS PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS POINTED OUT HIGH RISK SEX OFFENDER PAROLEES ARE ALREADY ON GPS MONITORING- AND I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF FACTS IN THE ANALYSIS- ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY SIX THOUSAND PAROLEES WHO WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO GPS MONITORING UNDER. THIS PROPOSED BILL. ONE STUDY TOUTING GPS SAID THAT- OPTIMUM CASELOADS FOR PAROLE OFFICERS MONITORING GPS PAROLEES WAS TWENTY PAROLEES CURRENTLY- THERE ARE ABOUT FIFTY PAROLEES WHO ARE NOT ON GPS MONITORING TO EACH PAROLE OFFICERS CASELOAD. SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD MULTIPLY- SIX THOUSAND AND DO THE MATH AND YOU HAVE TO HIRE MORE PAROLE OFFICERS- THE CALIFORNIA OFFICER INSPECTOR GENERAL- FOUND THAT ANY ADVANTAGES OR GPS MONITORING CAME AT THE EXPENSE OF DIVERTING AGENTS. SO THAT THEY WERE BUSY REVIEWING THE GPS TRACKS BECAUSE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO. TO REVIEW THE TRACKS DALY A LOT OF THE TRACKING REVIEWS AND THEN RESPOND TO ALERTS AND IN SOME CASES THERE WERE UP TO A THOUSAND ALERTS A DAY AND THOSE WERE ALERTS FROM THINGS LIKE THE BATTERY GOING OUT- SOMEBODY BEING UNDER A BRIDGE AND IT NOT WORKING- YOU KNOW JUST THINGS THAT WERE LIKE FALSE ALARMS. AND THIS TROUBLE IS NOT LIMITED TO CALIFORNIA ALREADY ON THE STATES THAT DO HAVE SIMILAR PROVISIONS NEW YORK AND FLORIDA THE AGENTS WERE SO OVERWHELMED WITH NONSTOP ALERTS. THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO PROPERLY SUPERVISE THE PAROLEES AND SOME OF THEM WENT ON TO COMMIT NEW VIOLENT CRIMES AND Q. CONCLUDING AND ONE SPEC IF YOU. OKAY HE CONCLUDED OKAY SO THAT AND CLOSING I WOULD JUST SAY THE SOLUTION IS TO PROVIDE HOUSING IT'S CHEAPER IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE AND IT WORKS TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM RE OFFENDING WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON A. B. EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN. THE NOW HEAR FROM WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- TO THE BILL A. B. EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN NAME AT ORGANIZATION.

THANK YOU AND I'LL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER CORK. ARM I'LL JUST HAVE A COMMENT AND THEN I'VE GOT A CO PRESENTER BELL BUT MY MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS APPROACH IS I DON'T THINK IT'S PRACTICAL. UP YOU HAVE TO CHARGE THESE BINDERS STANDING IS TWICE A DAY FOR AN HOUR- EACH TIME AND THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT AT NIGHT DURING THE DAY THEY COULD GET TO THE PAROLE OFFICERS- OFFICE AND DO IT THERE. AND THEN- YOU KNOW IF IT LOSES ITS CHARGE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TRACK THEM. OF WHICH SEEMS A LIKELY- EVENT AND THEN YOU'RE NO BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM SO THAT IS MY CONCERN AND- I HAVE TO GO PRESENTED BILL BUT- I'M SORRY. ON THAT ISSUE I WILL SAY THAT THEY DO CHARGE YOUR CELLPHONE THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS A QUESTION BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT TO. ANY OTHERS. SENILE YOU MAY CLOSE MISS COOPER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- JUST SOUTH BECAUSE NOT SPEAKER- DON'T START ANY MISTER CHAIR. HE COULD BE SPEAKER IF YOU WANT. MISTER CHAIR- IT'S INTERESTING I LISTEN TO THE COMMISSION SPEAKERS AND THE LADY REPRESENT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S SYNCING SHOULD WORRY ABOUT PUBLIC DOLLARS OVER SAVING LIVES- YOU KNOW ONE THING TO TALK ABOUT AS WE KNOW THAT VOLUNTARILY WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF PROBABLY. REFUSES TO MEET THE STIPULATIONS OF THEIR PAROLE ARE CAN BE LOCATED TO FULFILL PROGRAMS TO HELP THEM BETTER THEMSELVES IT IN FOR THE REHABILITATION THE FACT THEY CAN BE FOUND OR HELD ACCOUNTABLE. DENIES THEM THE HELP THEY NEED TO GET BACK INTO SOCIETY IS IN FACT PART OF PEARLS REHABILITATION. AND WITH THE BIG ISSUES WITH A LOT OF FOLKS AROUND PRO RIGHT NOW THAT. AREN'T GOING TO. VIOLENCE PREVENTION ANGER MANAGEMENT. DRUG REHAB. ALCOHOL REHAB- PAIRING ISSUES A BUNCH OF THINGS AND NOTHING HAPPENS RIGHT NOW THE LANGUAGE OUT THERE THE OPPOSITION ADMITS THERE'S A PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS AND PULL THESE BILLS NOT OF KNOWLEDGE THAT BALLING THE PAROLE IS A PROBLEM WITH THAT THIS PROBABLY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK THERE TWENTY TWO APRIL THESE THROUGH THEIR SEVEN YEAR HOMELESS AND NOT ALL ARE HOMELESS SUMMER HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THEIR- RESIDENTS SEARCH BY LAW ENFORCEMENT SO. W. DO HAVE SOME THAT ARE TRULY HOMELESS. NOW THE OPPOSITION MENTION KATE TO THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND VIOLENT MURDER. FOR THE NUMEROUS OTHER VICTIMS THAT KEEP STACKING UP. NO I CONCERN IS FOR THE PRO LEAGUE VICE IGNITIONS OF HIS PAROLE. IS IT LEARNING TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND ABIDING BY THEIR PAROLE STIPULATIONS. PART OF REHABILITATION INTO SOCIETY. I HAVE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE OPPOSITION BELIEVE THAT KATE WAS JUST COLLATERAL DAMAGE. BUT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO ALLOW VIOLENT COOLEY TO ROAM FREE AND TO NOT BE THE SIMPLEST CONDITIONS OF HIS PAROLE. I WANT TO REITERATE THE GOAL OF EIGHT A. B. EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN IS PROTECT WOMEN LIKE KATE FROM VIOLENT SEXUAL PREDATORS WHO VOLUNTARILY REFUSED TO SIMPLY COMPLY WITH A BROKEN DITIONS IRIS PRO HE'S FULLY COMPLY WITH THE PRO ARE NOT VICTIMS. K. TIBBETTSIN ME LIKE HER ARE THE VICTIMS. WHILE THE FENDERS WE SERVE AT HIGHER RATE HE NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS. OVER SIXTY PERCENT. AT SIXTY THREE POINT 8% OF THE VOTE OFFENDERS **** BY BEING REARRESTED. THIS COMPARES TO LESS THAN FORTY PERCNT. THIRTY NINE POINT EIGHT PERCENT. OF NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS WHO REAR VIEW WHO WERE REARRESTED. THIS IS FOR THE US SENTENCING COMMISSION- ONE OF OUR STAFFERS HERE LOT OF OUR CATHOLIC COMMUNITY LIVING LAND PARKER THE SOUTHLAND PARK AREA THIS IS A TRAGIC INCIDENT. IT KEEPS COMING UP IN UP AGAIN. ROMPER ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE BACK LARGELY WANT TO HELP THEM SUCCEED BUT THE BOTTOM LINE THE KNOX EXCEEDING IF NOT GET THE HELP THEY NEED. AND IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT A LOT I PUT THE BLAME SQUARELY ON CDC ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB NOT THE PRO AGENTS THOSE MEN WOMEN DO A GREAT JOB DAY IN AND DAY OUT IT'S A TOUGH JOB. THEIR CASELOADS OVERWHELMING BUT CVC ARE ON THEIR POLICIES ON WE WANT TO HELP THESE FOLKS THE HOMELESS THE STATE SHOULD HOUSE THEM BOTTOM LINE SHOULD BE HOMELESSNESS STREET SPECIAL WITH THESE FOLKS IT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF THING. WE THROWN OVER FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS A HOMELESSNESS ALMOST THIS IS GOTTEN WORSE SO I CAN UP. ALL PAROLEES WERE TALKING TO INFINITE NUMBER OF PAROLEES THAT IS MANAGEABLE THERE'S HALF WE HOUSING C. R. C. C. C. R. CAN DO THAT THEY HAVE NOT DONE THAT- SO IT SOME POINT WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE WITH THIS- THOSE. THE SHOOTING SECOND TO LAST WEEK. CDCR PAROLE. WITH THEIR FOR VIOLENT CRIME THE VIOLENCE SO A DEADLY WEAPON SO KEEP COMING BACK TO THAT SO- AT SOME POINT WE GOT IS SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THIS OTHERWISE IT LANGUISHES AND- I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU AND- AND I THINK OTHER MEMBERS HAVE SAID- TO THE TIBBETTS FAMILY YOUR YOUR YOUR STORIES TOUCHES ALL- IT IS A TRAGIC INCIDENT OCCURRED WITH WITHOUT A DOUBT AND NO ONE- POLICY COMMITTEE FOR NO ONE- IS LEGISLATURE WORLD. WE'LL SAY ANYTHING DIFFERENT- AND WE OF COURSE GRIEVE WITH YOU AND THERE'S PROBABLY NOTHING WE CAN SAY- THAT CAN TRULY HELP- THERE WAS A FAILURE. OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITHOUT A DOUBT- NOT NECESSARILY A FAILURE TO PAROLE CLASSIFICATION BUT DEFINITELY- THE COMMUNICATIONS TO ENSURE THE CDC ART DID THEIR JOB TO ENSURE. THAT THESE TRAGEDIES DON'T HAPPEN. DID NOT HAPPEN AND- WE AND WHEN I SAY WE THE STATE WE BECAUSE WE ARE CDC ARE NEED TO HELP CDC ARE DO A MUCH BETTER JOB ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC. THAT THE PUBLIC IS NOT IN DANGER- AS THEY MAKE THESE DECISIONS DESERT AS AS MY STEAM COPLEY FROM ELK GROVE HAS SAID THESE ARE TOUGH DECISIONS THAT WE PLACED ON TTC ART TO MAKE BUT WE ALSO- HOPEFUL- AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S PRESENTED OF FEAR IN THIS COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING AN ADEQUATE JOB WHICH NOW. HAS PLACED A FEAR OF PEOPLE BEING ALLOWED OUT ON THE STREET WHICH IS EXACERBATING THE CRIME PROBLEM AND SO I BELIEVE WE NEED TO WORK VIGOROUSLY. HELLO ALL OF US TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE GETS LEFT OUT- WORKER RECREATE THIS TRAGEDY BUT MOST IMPORTANT. THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IF SOMEONE IS EVEN. REMOTELY NOT ABIDING BY THE PAROLE OBLIGATIONS WE IMMEDIATELY TAKE CARE WE DON'T LET IT LANGUISH WE DON'T FINGER POINT- AND I'M NOT TRYING TO FINGER POINT BETWEEN ONE AGENCY D. OTHER I JUST WANT TO. FIX IT. JUST FIX IT SO THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN- UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE SOLUTION. BUT I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT FORWARD BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION- RESTORES OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE HAS SAID THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THIS IS THE WAY. BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THE BILL. SECOND WAS BEEN MOVED IMPROPERLY SECOND MAY CALL THE ROLL.

FOR YEARS WE HAVE WITNESSES WE HAVE WE HAVE WITNESSES FAR WITNESS FAR TOO MANY TRAGEDIES AND PATTERNS OF INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE SHERIFF'S. ARE ALLOWING TO OVERSEE. THE CAUSE OF DEATH RULING. THIS HAS RESULTED IN BIAS MEDICAL INVESTIGATIONS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. A. B. SIXTEEN OH EIGHT WE'LL PUT CALIFORNIA IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE STATES THAT HAVE ALREADY ADVANCED A SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION LIKE ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN OH EIGHT CALLOW IN CALIFORNIA TEN COUNTIES. ARE ALREADY DOING WHAT ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN OH EIGHT SEEKS TO ACCOMPLISH I AM PROUD TO SAY. THAT THE- THAT LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO COUNTIES. ARE PROUD SUPPORTERS OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BOTH OF THESE COUNTIES ALSO HAVE SUCCESSFUL INDEPENDENT FUNCTIONS CURRENT LAW CURRENT STATE LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE NO ONE UNDERSCORE DOES NOT REQUIRE A SHERIFF TO HAVE ANY MEDICAL BACKGROUND. OR CERTIFICATION TO ASSUME THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITY OF A CORNER. AS A RESULT IT HAS CAUSED MANY TO QUESTION WHETHER AND MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS IS BALLOT NGUYEN THERE IS ALL OFFICER INVOLVED DEATH. IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR ANGELO CANTLE. THE UNITED STATES NAVY VETERAN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED. BY POLICE. ANGELO KATO'S CASE EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THE DEATH THE CARD R. COSTA COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE ISSUED A REPORT B. FOR THE AUTOPSY. BEFORE THE AUTOPSY. AND RULED THAT THE DEATH OF AN ACT OF DEATH AND ACCIDENTS AND LISTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH AS EXCITED DELIRIUM. I WANT YOU TO PONDER ON THAT FOR A MOMENT WHAT DOES EXCITED DELIRIUM ACTUALLY MEANS. THE TERM EXCITED DELIRIUM HAS BEEN REJECTED. I SAID REJECTED BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION THIS TERM HAS BEEN REJECTED BY MEDICAL COMMUNITIES YET IT IS STILL USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EXPLAIN CERTAIN DEATHS OCCURRED JOAQUIN COUNTY IT TOOK A VERY PUBLIC EMBARRASSING RESIGNATION FROM THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER AND OTHER MEDICAL EXAMINERS ON STAFF OF FOR THAT- THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY. OVER NINE MONTHS OVER NINE MONTHS PERIOD THE CHEAPEST MEDICAL EXAMINERS DOCUMENTS CALCULUS EXAMPLES OF AUTOPSIES THEY PERFORMED THIS DOCUMENTATION INCLUDES. INSTANCES WHERE THE SHERIFF CHANGED THE CALLS OF DEATH BINDINGS. ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENTATION IN SOME CASES THEY FELT PRESSURED BY THIS YEAR TO REPORT SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN ORANGE COUNTY CHRISTOPHER EISINGER DIED AFTER BEING TAKEN OFF LIFE SUPPORT EIGHT DAYS AFTER BEING TRANSPORTED BY AMBULANCE TO THE HOSPITAL SIX PEOPLE ATTENDED THE AUTOPSY INCLUDING FOR MEMBERS OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND TWO OFFICERS FROM THE SENATE FROM. ANAHEIM POLICE DEPARTMENT THE PATH OLOGY THIS CONCLUDES THAT THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST. THREE YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH A JURY FOUND THE OFFICERS WERE NEGLIGENT. AND LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHRISTOPHER'S DEATH AND AWARDED THE FAMILY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES. KERN COUNTY DAVID SILVA DIED FROM A OF A- POSITIONAL TO CONFUSE ME- A FIX THE- DURING AN ENCOUNTER WHEN SEVERAL KERN COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES AND TWO HIGH PATROL OFFICERS THE KERN COUNTY- CORNERS DECLARED THE DEATH ACCIDENTAL AND HEART DISEASE RELATED. THE PROSECUTOR THE PROSECUTION DID NOT FILE CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST KERN COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES OR CALIFORNIA HIGH PATROL YET CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT COUNTY ENDED UP SETTLING A THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR CIVIL LAWSUIT. THESE ARE ONLY A FEW EXAMPLES WHERE COUNTIES HAVE SPENT LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO SETTLE. POSSIBILITY TO QUESTION WHAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE AND THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. JOINING ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF SIXTEEN OH EIGHT IS THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER OF- EXAMINE OFFICER FROM WASHINGTON DC WHO ALSO CONDUCTED THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AUDIT OF THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. IN ADDITION- WE ALSO HAVE JOINING ME US IN PERSON IS- CENTER KETO COLLINS THE MOTHER AND JOKING SO BELLA- CANTIL SISTER UP AND LOOKING TO AND ROBERT COLLINS THE STEPFATHER OF ANGELO KING TO. THANK YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TWO MINUTES APIECE OR WHATEVER WE ONLY MOVED TO THE TO THE DOCTOR DOCTOR MITCHELL. OKAY HE'S ON THE LINE OKAY A FIVE MINUTES ALL TOGETHER SO OKAY THE DOCTOR MITCHELL MET TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME- IT IS LOOK OKAY. GO AHEAD T. OPERATOR OPEN UP LIKE A DOCTOR MITCHELL. AT&amp;T OPERATOR. THE WORD EIGHTY NINE HE HAS I DO NOT SEE A NAME LISTED IF HE COULD PLEASE PRESS ZERO THEN ONE TO TAG KIDS LINE. OKAY WHILE THE FIND A DOCTOR MITCHELL WE CAN GO TO AND DOES MOM CENTER CAN TELL SURE. GOOD MORNING WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MY NAME I COUNTY PULLED THE MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CASSANDRA KING TO COLLINS THIS IS BELLA AND ROBERT. WE ARE THE FAMILY OF FANS ARE LOOKING. MY SON ANGELES KILLED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY BY ANTIOCH POLICE OFFICERS. IN FRONT OF ME ON MY BEDROOM FOR. HE WAS EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT MIGHT. BUT HE WAS NOT VIOLENT. DID NOT HAVE ANY WEAPONS AND WAS NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ANY. COMMON SUBSTANCES OF ABUSE. DESPITE THE OFFICERS ACKNOWLEDGING ALL OF THESE THE PLACE THE MONEY STOMACH WUNDERGROUND HANDCUFFED HIM PUSHED HIS CROSSED LEGS. AGAINST HIS BACK AND BEYOND THE BACK BUSINESS. I REMEMBER DEEP THEM STAYING. SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS WHAT WE DO TO CALM THEM DOWN. DURING AT LEAST FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES OF THIS RESTRAINT HE WAS COMPLETELY. UNRESPONSIVE. THANK YOU I. SO AFTER HIS DEATH WE EXPERIENCED A LOT OF DECEIT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- WHEN WE FIRST MET ARE LAWYERS THEY TOLD US THAT HIS DEATH WOULD BE BLAMED ON EXCITED DELIRIUM DESPITE WHAT EVIDENCE WAS COLLECTED EARLY ON- AND SO WE GOT A PRIVATE PATHOLOGIST TO DO OUR- EXAMINATION. BECAUSE WE DO NOT TRUST THAT THERE WOULD BE AN UNBIASED INVESTIGATION AND- AUTOPSY AND ACTIVITY CORONER'S INQUEST WHICH DETERMINES IN ALL MANNER OF DEATH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL- WE WITNESSED FIRST HAND THE DECEIT AND- THE. THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY THAT GOES ON BETWEEN THE SHERIFF'S AND CORONER'S IN THIS INESTIGATION THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE INDEPENDENT- THEY DID NOT NAME WITNESSES THEY WITHHELD EVIDENCE THEY LEAD WITNESSES THAT THEY DID NAME- TO CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS THAT THEY HAD ALL CREATED TOGETHER. AND THEY COMPLETELY- NICK NORD MEDICAL RECORDS- THANK YOU SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY THIS MORNING S. N. MEMBERS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR AN AB SIXTY NO EIGHT IS A COMMONSENSE REFORMS THAT INCREASES TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY- AND OBJECTIVITY IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING A DEATH. THAT IS QUESTIONABLE. THAT IS A PROCESS THAT SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL AND NOT AN ELECTED OFFICIAL THAT HAS NO MEDICAL TRAINING. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AT A TIME WHEN WE- WE CERTAINLY HAD QUESTIONS AS SOON AS OUR LAWYER TOLD US THAT WE SHOULD GET AN INDEPENDENT PATHOLOGIST. BUT I THINK IN THIS SOCIETY IN GENERAL YOU'RE SEEING THAT EVERYONE WANTS AN INDEPENDENT PATHOLOGIST BECAUSE THERE'S NO TRUST IN CALIFORNIA. A. N. INTO THAT SEPARATION IN THAT OBJECTIVITY BECAUSE THE SHERIFF OVERSEAS IN FORTY EIGHT COUNTIES. WHAT THE OP WHAT THE CORNER CONFINED AND SO THIS IS REALLY A COMMONSENSE REFORM WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS SOMETHING THAT INCREASES ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND OBJECTIVITY AND- AND IT'S A GOOD GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE IT BASICALLY SAYS WE CAN TRUST THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE- YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT. SHOULD NOT INVESTIGATE ITSELF WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING AT ISSUE SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS REALLY I THINK I COMMONSENSE REFORM IT JUST TAKES OUT WHO IS THE TOP PERSON THAT'S MAKING THAT DETERMINATION. AND IN INSTEAD IT IT JUST MEANS THAT SOMEBODY WOULD AS SCIENTIFIC TRAINING AND THAT OF A PATHOLOGIST THE DOCTOR IS GOING TO MAKE THAT ULTIMATE DETERMINATION AND NOT BE OVERRIDDEN BY A SHERIFF. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU- AT&amp;T OPERATOR REVILLA PINE THAT COULD DOCTOR. I AM SORRY NOW- THE BILL LINE HE WASN'T ABLE TO GET AND FOR SOME REASON THEY'RE NOT ALLOWING ARDOCH IMAGE WILL WILL GO TO ROOM FOR ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WHO SHALL MATURE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION ON BEHALF OF THAT I. CALIFORNIA STATE CORONERS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SIXTEEN OH EIGHT- THE CURRENT SHERIFF CORNER APPROACHUTILIZED BY CHOICE- BY A VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA- COUNTIES. ENJOYS THE BENEFIT OF OPERATIONAL AND BUDGETARY EFFICIENCY- SEPARATING THIS OFFICES WILL REMOVE INVESTIGATIVE EFFICIENCIES AND DRASTICALLY INCREASE COUNTY COSTS. UNNECESSARILY BY REQUIRING FORTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO STAND UP SEPARATE CORNER OFFICES. ARE FROM A GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE THIS BILL IS HEAVY HANDED AND DISREGARDS LOCAL CONTROL. EXISTING LAW ALREADY PERMITS COUNTIES TO PURSUE MULTIPLE MODELS OF COUNTY OFFICE CONSOLIDATION OR SEPARATION HI THIS IS A DECISION BEST LEFT TO THIS SOUND DISCRETION OF LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BUDGET AUTHORITY AND RELEVANT LOCAL EXPERIENCE. AT THIS BILL INCLUDES NO FUNDING FOR COUNTIES TO SEPARATE THE OFFICES OF CORNER AND SHERIFF THAT DEMANDS THAT IT BE DONE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE MASSIVE COST THIS WILL CREATE. EVEN IF FUNDING WERE PROVIDED THIS BILL DISREGARDS LOCAL CONTROL AND A DECISION MADE OVER BY THE YEARS BY PAT BY VAST MAJORITY OF STATES COUNTIES. COUNTIES HAVE ADOPTED PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS PERCEIVED CONFLICTS WITH HOW DEATH INVESTIGATIONS ARE UNDERTAKEN. IN ORDER TO APPARENTLY FURTHER ENGAGING IN THIS IRINA WE BELIEVE AB SIXTY NO EIGHT IMPOSES THEIR- WE INCENTIVE SEISMIC SHIFT IN HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CHOOSE TO ORGANIZE YOUR FUNCTIONS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IN THE WE HAVE DOCTOR MITCHELL ON THE LINE- GREAT DR MITCHELL WHEN EVERY YEAR READY TO BEGIN. YOU HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES CAN YOU HEAR ME IT. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES WE CAN.

OVER TWO THOUSAND AUTOPSIES IN MY CAREER AND YOU HEARD THAT I WAS PART OF THE TRANSITION FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN SHERIFF'S CORONER'S OFFICE TO A MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM. THIS BILL GOES A LONG WAY TO INSTILLING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN DEPTH INVESTIGATION PARTICULARLY THOSE DEATHS THAT OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. ONLY THAT BUT PROPERLY STAFFED AND TRAINED MEDICAL LEGAL DEATH INVESTIGATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIANS. THAT ALLOW THEM TO RELY ON NOT JUST FOR DEATHS IN CUSTODY BUT FOR SUDDEN UNEXPECTED NATURAL DEATHS DEATHS OF MOMS WHO DIE DURING CHILDBIRTH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE DEATHS DUE TO COLD BIT AND EVEN IN THE RECENT HISTORY MASS FATALITY EVENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE HAVE CALLED FOR THE STRENGTHENING OF THE MEDICAL LEGAL DEATH INVESTIGATION. SYSTEM NATIONWIDE. BY REMOVE THE SHOW CORONER SYSTEM. NOW LET ME BE CLEAR BOTH CALLED AND MANNER OF DEATH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AT THE OFFICIAL RECORD OF DEATH IS THE DEATH CERTIFICATE WHICH IS USED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL. THIS DOESN'T SHOW A DISTRICT SUPPORT FOR SHERIFF'S BUT ACTUALLY SUPPORT SHERIFF'S BY SEPARATING THIS RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF QUALIFICATIONS THAT A SHERIFF HAS IN ESTABLISHING MANNER OF DEATH- THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE THIS SYSTEM IN THIS IS HAPPENED. SINCE THE COLONIAL INVASION OF THIS COUNTRY AS WELL AS SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE MEDICAL LEGAL DEATH INVESTIGATION SYSTEM AB SIXTEEN OH EIGHT WITH A SMALL BUT NECESSARY STEP. TOWARDS GIVING CLOSURE TO FAMILIES THANK CREATING A RELIABLE RECOUP REPRODUCIBLE TIMELY AND ACCURATE DEATH INVESTIGATION SYSTEM I'M PROUD OF THIS AUSPICIOUS BODY FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE THIS CHANGE AND HOW CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO BE THE LEADER.

MCCULLOUGH I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL- YOU MENTIONED AND LOOKING TO- AND THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT CASE- WHEN YOU HAVE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS WERE IN CUSTODY DEATHS- THERE'S AN INHERENT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE SHERIFF. WHO OFFICE PARTICIPATED IN THE TRAGIC OUTCOME ALSO THAN INVESTIGATING THE CORONER'S OFFICE I ALSO THINK OF JOHN HORTON. WHOSE DEATH WAS RULED. A SUICIDE ONE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY COUNTY JAIL ONLY TO THEN BE OVERTURNED AFTER BEING INDEPENDENTLY INVESTIGATE I THINK OF ANDREAS WE DATO. IN LOS ANGELES AS WELL. WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE'VE SEEN. THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM AND IT'S A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE REMEDIED AND I. APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT REMEDY IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF CO AUTHORS I'M HAPPY TO JOIN YOU. THANK YOU. REALLY NOTED. DESPITE THE THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AS WELL AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED AS A CO AUTHOR AS WELL I JUST WANTED TO PARTICULARLY THANK THE KEY TO FAMILY ANGELA KEEP OF STANLEY FOR BEING HERE- THEY ARE A PART OF A TRIBE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT EXIST AND FOLLOW ALONG AND- WE'RE BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO. SPEAK TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF ANGELES STUFF TODAY- BUT I KNOW THAT THEY TRAVEL WITH MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE SHARE SIMILAR STORIES- WHERE WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A SEPARATION OF THE CORNER FROM FROM FROM THE SHERIFF IN THOSE INVESTIGATIONS AS THEY CONTINUE TO GO ON SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS COMING TO SHARE YOUR STORY AND TO SHARE ANGELA WITH THIS. THANK YOU. THE OTHER COMMENT YEAH. YES SORRY I SOMEONE NEEDS TO TEMPER SO IN THIS DISCUSSION A LITTLE BIT- I'D LIKE TO JUST NOTE THAT- BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SENATE BILL ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE. IT WAS ABOUT FOUR BY- PAM IN JACKSON SENATORS PAM JACKSON. OF WHICH FOLLOWED A HIGH PROFILE CASE IN VENTURA COUNTY- THEY JOINTLY AUTHORED THE LEGISLATION WHICH INCREASE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST WORKING FOR THE SHERIFF'S CORNER BY DEFINING AUTOPSIES AS A MEDICAL PROCEDURE THAT MAY BE FORMED ONLY BY A LICENSED PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON. MOREOVER THE BILL PROVIDED. THAT WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL DIES AS A RESULT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY APART THE PROHIBITS LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVED. IN THE DEATH FROM ENTERING THE AUTOPSY. OR HAVING ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE EXAMINATION SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT SEPARATION ALREADY EXISTS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL HARMS AND INTERFERES WITH SELF DETERMINATION ON THE ISSUE WITH THE COUNTIES. YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT POSITION THERE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND- SO UNFORTUNATE I THINK YOUR YOUR BILL IS WELL INTENTIONED BUT I REALLY. THINK THAT- THIS PROBLEM HAS ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED AND I THINK THE COUNTY SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION. ON HOW THIS PARTNERSHIP SHOULD- EXIST IT'S VERY VERY COSTLY. TO DO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO DO ALSO AND I DON'T SEE A FUNDING MECHANISM TO HELP THAT. SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL SORRY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION WANT TO THANK THE KANTO FAMILY DOCTOR- MICHEAUX AND THOSE WHO. VOICE THEIR- AYE VOTES OR SUPPORT FOR SYMBOL BILL SIXTEEN OH EIGHT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. I'M NOT ONLY DOES IT. GIVE A PIECE OF MINE. TWO OF THE FAMILY WHO LOST A LOVED ONE- WEATHER'S INVOLVES- INVOLVED SHOOTING OR AN OFFICER. IN OF SOMEONE PASSING AWAY IN CUSTODY. IT ALSO PROVIDES TRANSPARENCY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT- TWO ONE I HAVE A- AUTOPSY- IN A RULING- THEY EITHER. THAT EITHER CLEARS A OFFICER. OF WHAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE UPSET- BUT ALSO GIVES THE FAMILY. THE PEACE OF MIND TO ACTUALLY KNOW THE CAUSE OF DEATH- I'VE MADE MENTION IN MY OPENING COMMENTS. ABOUT THE COSTS. I KNOW IT'S BEEN. SAID TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN THIS HEARING. HOW EXPENSIVE IT WOULD BE FOR COUNTIES TO SEPARATE. WITH THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. EXPAND OR PASSED MONEY TO THE SHERIFF. TO OVERSEE THE COUNTING. WHAT DID STAND FOR THE COUNT FOR THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO GIVE THE MONEY DIRECTLY TO THE CORONER'S OFFICE AFTER IT'S BEEN BIFURCATED AND SEPARATED SO THEY CAN DO INDEPENDENT AUTOPSIES WITHOUT ANY POTENTIAL INFLUENCE- BY A SHARED THE OVERSEAS SUCH OF RESPONSIBILITIES. ALSO INDICATED- THAT WANT TO GIVE A FAMILY THE KIND OF PEACE OF MIND BUT ALSO THE COUNTY. I MADE MENTION THAT COUNTIES HAVE TO PAY OUT WRONGFUL DEATH OF- IS LARGE SUMS OF MONEY. AND SO THOSE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY- COULD BE REDUCED BY SEPARATING- THE TWO DEPARTMENTS- OF THE SHARE STANDING ALONE AND THE COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE STANDING ALONG AS WELL- MEMBERS I HAVE ALSO TALKED ABOUT EXCITED DELIRIUM AND ALSO GIVEN. OTHER INDICATIONS OF WHERE COUNTIES HAD TO PAY OUT MONIES- BASED ON THEIR RULING. WE HAD IN SAN JOAQUIN A MEDICAL EXAMINER OFFICE WHO RESIGNED UNDER EMBARRASSMENT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN MOVING FORWARD AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL SIXTEEN OH EIGHT. PROVIDE THE KIND OF TRANSPARENCY AND THE PEACE OF MIND THAT FAMILIES ABSOLUTELY DEMAND AND ABSOLUTELY NEED MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK BUT I VOTE FOR THE FAMILY MEMBERS TO KEEP YOUR FAMILY AND THOSE. WHO HAVE ALREADY- I SPOKE UP IN MY OPENING COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN A DECADE I WOULD TAKE YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I WILL ALSO OFFER MY CITIZENS AS SOMEONE WHO SITS ON BUDGET SUB BY PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET. UP TO HELP YOU FIND THE FUNDING IF NEEDED. I DON'T THINK IT'S NEEDED BUT IF IT'S NEEDED WE SHOULD ADDRESS IT AND FIND THE FUNDING PORT PORT DIRECTOR TO MAKE THIS MOVE FORWARD AND ULTIMATELY- MAKE SURE THAT IS IMPLEMENTED. IN EVERY COUNTY AND IN THE STATE THE CHURCH RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ON AB SIXTEEN OH EIGHT BY SEVEN MEMBER GIPSON THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER HI LACKEY.

OUR GUN LAWS AND PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S SEVEN STATES HAVE ALREADY PASSED LAWS SIMILAR. TO THIS POLICY IS ONLY BE- SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE AB SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE IS ALSO IN LOCKSTEP WITH THE FEDERAL ACTION LAST MONDAY BY THE BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO REGULATE GHOST GUNS PARTS BY TREATING THEM AS FAR ARMS LET ME BE CLEAR. THIS BILL IS ABOUT TAKING AWAY IS NOT ABOUT TAKING AWAY THE RIGHTS OF LEGAL GUN OWNERS IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE ENSURES THAT THESE DANGEROUS AND UNTRACEABLE WEAPONS ARE ERADICATED GHOST GUN PARTS AND KITS CAN BE ORDERED ONLINE IN STORES OR AT A GUN SHOW WITHOUT UNDERSCORE WITHOUT A BACKGROUND. CHECK AND THEY CAN BE PUT TOGETHER. TO FORM A FULLY FUNCTIONING FAR AREN'T UNDER A HALF AN HOUR. LESS THAN THIRTY MINUTES. IT CAN BE PUT TOGETHER MEMBERS FOR THE MOMENT FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME OR LESS NEEDED TO DISCUSS THIS BILL TODAY SOMEONE COULD HAVE BUILT A GHOST GUN AND IT IS EVEN LESS TIME THAT IT TOOK THEM TO BUILD THAT GUN THAT THEY COULD USE THAT GUN AND TAKE SOMEONE'S LIFE AWAY. AND ALMOST EVERYONE. CAN AND ANYONE CAN ORDER THESE KIDS IN A VIDEO THAT MY STAFF HAS SAID EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU IN YOUR INBOX A SEPARATE SURE IT WAS STILL A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD.

THE WILDFIRE OF GUN VIOLENCE IN NOT ONLY MY COMMUNITY BUT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND IT'S SPECIALLY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN LOS ANGELES ALONE DURING JUST THE FIRST HALF OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE. POLICE CONFISCATED EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE GHOST GUNS THIS WAS A 4100% INCREASE FROM THE PERIOD PRIOR YEAR.

EIGHT ATTEMPTED HOMICIDES ED A DOZEN ASSAULTS AND ARMED ROBBERS JEFF IN LOS ANGELES ALONE IN ADDITION TO THE CALMUS INDIVIDUALS OF ALL INDIVIDUAL HOMICIDES GHOST GUNS ARE BEING USED IN MASS SHOOTINGS. FOR EXAMPLES. DAVID MORA. SINCE APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE MORE WAS UNDER A RESTRAINING ORDER THAT BARRED HIM FROM POSSESSING A FIREARM AND AUTHORITIES DO NOT KNOW HOW HE OBTAINED ONE. WE HAVE TO STOP THE KILLING AND START THE HEALING PROCESS IN THIS STATE. LOSING LOVED ONES DUE TO GUN VIOLENCE. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE. AND BRING US ONE STEP CLOSER TO JUSTICE ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE SEEKS TO HALT THE SALE OF FIREARMS PRECURSOR PARTS WHICH ARE UNFINISHED PARTS AND ON TRACEABLE GUN PARTS UNTIL. UNTIL AND SUCH TIME THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGULATES THEM I PASSING THIS BILL WOULD GO INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY THE FIRST TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY THREE AND EVERYONE IN POSSESSION OF A UN SERIALIZED BAR ON WOULD HAVE SIX MONTHS FROM THAT DATE TO STERILIZE THOSE PARTICULAR FAR ARMS.

OUR STATE HAS UNFORTUNATELY BECOME AN EPICENTER FOR THESE TYPES OF GUNS IN LOS ANGELES THE NUMBER OF GHOSTS AND RECOVERED FROM CRIME SCENE HAS RISEN APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. LAST WEEK PRESIDENT BY THE MINISTRATION FINALIZED A RULE TO REGULATE THOSE GUNS. THAT WILL AMONG OTHER THINGS ENSURE THAT THE WEAPON IF IT LOOKS LIKE A GUN SHIP LIKE A GUN AND KILLED LIKE A GUN. IT WILL BE TREATED LIKE A GUN. WELL THE ROLE OF A MAJOR STEP FORWARD IN CUTTING OFF THE STREAM OF UNTRACEABLE GUNS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE ACTION ON BOTH GUNS AND EVERY LEVEL. PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES LIKE THE ONE I EXPERIENCED. EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE.

AND WE'RE HERE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH MAKES SEEKS TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF SO CALLED PRECURSOR PARTS BANS THE SALE OF ANY UN SERIALIZED FRAME OR RECEIVER AND PROHIBITS THE SALE OF COMPUTER NUMERICALLY CONTROLLED MACHINES WAS PRIMARY PURPOSES PRECURSOR PART MANUFACTURING. WITHOUT QUESTION THE RECENT ESCALATION IN CRIME THROUGHOUT THE NATION IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN HOWEVER PRIVATELY MADE FIREARMS HAVE BECOME AN UNFORTUNATE SCAPEGOAT ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF GHOST GUNS HAVE INCREASED IN POPULARITY QUOTE UNQUOTE GHOST GUNS THERE IS SIMPLY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE THE CAUSE FOR THE SURGE IN VIOLENT CRIME ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES. RECENTLY REPORTED BY THE MEDIA GOES GUNS HAVE BEEN TIED TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE HOMICIDES OR ATTEMPTED HOMICIDES NATIONWIDE SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN NOT OUR NUMBERS ATF WHICH IS ZERO POINT 36% OF ACTUAL HOMICIDES FURTHER OF THE GUNS RECOVERED IN THE OFT REPORTED STATISTICS FROM L. A. COUNTY ELLIE CITY THERE IS A LITTLE DATA THAT INDICATES HOW MANY WERE USED. IN THE ACTUAL- COMMISSION OF GUN VIOLENCE FINALLY ONE POINT THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY OVERLOOKED IS THE FACT THAT WHENEVER A FIREARM IS SEIZED AND THE SERIAL NUMBER HAS BEEN REMOVED AS IN FILED OFF OR A PUBLIC RATED WHICH IS A COMMON THING AMONG CRIMINAL USE GUNS IT NOW FITS THE DEFINITION AND IS STATISTICALLY COUNTED AS A GHOST GUN THIS IS MISLEADING THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE GUNS WERE MADE. AND SEVERAL NUMBERS WERE ADDED TO THEM. THE OF THIS BILL THAT BANS THE SALE OF COMPUTER NUMERICALLY CONTROLLED MACHINES THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MANUFACTURING ON SERIALIZE FRAMES AND RECEIVERS AS TROUBLING AS WELL. GIVEN THAT IT DISCOURAGED REGARDS THE FACT THAT CNC MACHINES NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OR WHAT SIZE CAN BE USED TO MANUFACTURE PARTS MADE OF METAL PLASTIC OR EVEN WOOD. ALL OF WHICH- COULD BE. AND IN MOST CASES ARE UNRELATED TO FIREARMS A GUN PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA UNTIL WE PASS STRINGENT PENALTIES FOR THE CRIMINAL USE OF FIREARMS THERE WILL BE LITTLE TO NO IMPACT ON GUN VIOLENCE IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE AB SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO.

THANK YOU MARK HAS BEEN THANK YOU THANK YOU BRING ABOUT COMMITTEE- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ONE RESPOND TO IT IN MR. I'LL MOVE THE BILL BUT ALSO WANTED TO THANK AT THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS LEGISLATION I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT WITH YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT- AND WAS ABLE TO SEE THE COMPONENT PARTS. OF THAT OF OUR SO CALLED. YOU HAVE OTHER USES BUT CLEARLY DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER USE BUT THEN TO BE A PART OF. THE COMPONENT OF A GUN- AND THOSE PARTS ARE UN SERIALIZED THE FACT THAT THEIR- SERIALIZED BECAUSE GREAT CAUSES GREAT HARM- AT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TRACEABLE ARE NOT ABLE TO BE PUT TOGETHER- FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN TO BE A GUN THAT CAN BE USED. TO CAUSE HARM SO I THANK YOU FOR THE BILL AND- AND FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE PUTTING I. THINK SELECTED. YEAH FOR OF ALL LET ME SAY THAT- I YOU'RE INTO ARE NOBLE ADMIRABLE BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL HATE THE- THE VIOLENT OUTCOMES THAT ARE- BEING DISPLAYED. AND UP ON OCCASION USING THESE THESE TYPES OF WEAPONS CALLED GHOST GUNS NO ONE LIKES GHOST GUNS NO ONE. AS A MATTER OF FACT- IT'S ALREADY ILLEGAL TO MANUFACTURE FIREARM WITHOUT NOTIFYING. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WE'RE GETTING A SERIAL NUMBER FOR THE FIREARM. AND THERE'S ALSO A PROHIBITION AGAINST SELLING ONE ALREADY- FIRE PARTS DON'T KILL PEOPLE. BEHAVIOR KILLS PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHAT I WISHED ARE FOCUS WOULD BE MORE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE- THE VIOLENT BEHAVIOR ISSUES WITH ANY WEAPON NO MATTER WHAT IT IS AND- I JUST FEEL LIKE THIS IS CHASING THE WRONG THING SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. SORRY THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENT. SANTIAGO YEAH I THINK IT WAS DIFFERENT TYPICALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE A LOT OF WORDS ON SOMETHING THAT I SUPPORT BUT I THINK THIS IS THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I CAN APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION HAVE AN OPPOSING VIEW I DON'T SHARE THAT VIEW BUT BUT I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS RESPECT FACTOR YOU COMING HERE UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST- AND I HAD TO SAY THAT BUT I DON'T AGREE BECAUSE- THESE GUNS HAVE NO PLACE ON THE STREETS. SOMEBODY'S GUNS WERE BUILT. THE MASS DESTROYS SOMEBODY'S GUNS WERE AT THE CONCEPT OF CREATING PARTS THAT ARE UNDETECTABLE SO THAT THEY CAN BE PUT TOGETHER IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION STILL UNDER INTACT THE BOWL. TO MAKE A GUN THAT UNDETECTABLE. THAT IS BUILT WITH THE IF IT WOULD WITH THE INTENT OF MASS DESTRUCTION TO ME MAKES NO SENSE FOR US TONIGHT I MEAN LET LET ALONE HAVE A BUT WE CAN HAVE THAT DEBATE DOWN THE LINE FOR THEM TO EXIST FOR THEM TO HAVE THEM FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN TO BE WALK AROUND THE STREET OWNING ONE OF THESE GUNS. FOR MASS DESTRUCTION OF WE'VE DONE A LOT IN CALIFORNIA BUT BUT THE RIVER THE REALITY WE REMAINS AND UNLESS WE GET COMPREHENSIVE. GUN CONTROL MEASURES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL PEOPLE CAN STILL GO OUT OF STATE GET ONE BRING IT BACK AGAIN. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME TO HAVE A GUN LIKE THAT OR WHY SOMEBODY WOULD WANT TO HAVE ONE W. AS IT MAY THE CONCEPT ALONE OF HAVING A GUN LIKE THIS IT IS UNTRACEABLE. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE TO ME THAT WE WILL EVEN HAVE. A DEBATE ABOUT TRACING A GUN. L. A. N. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT ABOUT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD FOCUS ON. ON PEOPLE NOT GUNS BUT A PERSON IS NOT GOING TO GET UP AND SHOOT SOMEBODY WITH A GUN. SO OF COURSE WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE GUY YOU WANT ELIMINATE A LARGE PORTION OF THE EQUATION OF WHAT KILLED SOMEBODY WITH A GUN YOU HAVE TO LIMIT THE GUN WE EAT WE CAN VIEW IT DIFFERENTLY BUT THE OTHER AT THE END OF THE DAY. THE LOGIC STILL STANDS. YOU DON'T GET UP TO SHOOT SOMEBODY WITH A GUN AND HURT THEM UNLESS THE GUN IS PRESENT. GIVEN THE JUST NO SHOT THAT'S THE LOGIC. SO WE CAN DO. SO WE COULD BE THERE ALL DAY LONG BUT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED. THE STRONGEST CONTROL CONTROL MEASURES. ON THE STREETS TO PREVENT. PEOPLE FROM GETTING SHOT OR PEOPLE FROM SHOOTING. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR HARD WORK AT THE GIVEN MODEST IN YOUR EFFORTS. ITBUT I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE'RE GONNA BE FACING AND YOU HAVE. BEEN DOGGED ON THIS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS I WANT TO THANK YOU AND- AND WE HOPE TO ALLOW ME TO JOIN YOUR PARTS OF IN ALREADY CO AUTHORED IT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT INCREDIBLE IN POINT THAT THIS GETS SIGNED I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE- HAVE A WAY TO DETECT A GUN TO THE BILL THE MURDER PEOPLE- AND IT'S- IT'S JUST UNIMAGINABLE TO ME THAT WE EAT. OR EVEN HAVING A DEBATE ABOUT IDENTIFYING UNDETECTABLE WEAPON MADE FOR MASS DESTRUCTION. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYMORE COMMENT. SEEING NONE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION I JUST WANT TO CALL TO YOUR ATTENTION WHAT TRANSPIRED IN SACRAMENTO I MADE MENTION OF MY OPENING REMARKS ABOUT DAVID MORE. DAVID MORA HE- HAD THERE WAS A REGISTERED GUN OWNER- HE WAS RICHARD GUN OWNER BECAUSE THE WORK THAT THIS PUBLIC SAFETY AND MY COLLEAGUE DONE. BECAUSE OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT EXIST AT GOMEZ TAKEN AWAY AND TAKEN OUT AT HOME. BUT DAVID MOORE ALSO HAD SUPERVISED VISITATION RIGHTS. TO SEE HIS THREE DAUGHTERS. WELL DAVID- MATE A. K. FORTY SEVEN. I WENT TO GO VISIT HIS THREE DAUGHTERS. AT CHURCH A PLACE OF WORSHIP HERE IN SACRAMENTO. HE TOOK THAT A. K. FORTY SEVEN IS A R. FIFTEEN I APOLOGIZE. ANY KILLED HIS THREE DAUGHTERS AT CHURCH. HE KILLED THE SOCIAL WORKER AND THEN HE TURNED HIS GUN ON HIMSELF. HE WAS PROHIBITED FROM HAVING A GUN AT ALL. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN TV ON TV TIME AND TIME AGAIN IS MASS SHOOTINGS NEW YORK CHICAGO. LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA PROVIDES OF GREAT LEADERSHIP AS RELATES TO PUBLIC SAFETY IN THIS SPACE AND OTHER STATES FOLLOW CALIFORNIA BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE UNLESS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTERVENE I AM SO EXCITED THAT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. ANNOUNCED HIS WAR ON GHOST GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY WE NEED FEDERAL INTERVENTION WE NEED FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IT WITH HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT OUR GOVERNOR WANT AS A FATHER AS A HUSBAND TO UNDERSTAND THAT NONE OF US. ARE EXEMPT FROM BEING AT A CHURCH A CLUB- WALKING DOWN OUR STREETS BEING EXEMPT FROM GUN VIOLENCE- COMING AND KNOCKING ON OUR DOORS THIS IS A VERY THOUGHTFUL MEASURE. WE HAVE TO STAND UP FOR FAMILIES WHO STILL MOURN THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE WE HAVE TO STAND UP FOR MOTHERS WHO STILL WEEP BECAUSE THEIR CHILD HAS JUST BEEN DONE DOWN WE JUST HEARD FROM LITTLE MIA WHO'S AT SCHOOL RIGHT NOW WHO HAD TO SAY GOODBYE BECAUSE SHE THEY WERE IN SAUGUS- AND- HER FRIENDS THAT OTHERS WERE TAKEN AWAY DUE TO NON VIOLENCE AND A GHOST GUNS. WHEN IS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH THIS BILL IS A THOUGHTFUL MEASURE- AND WE BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO THE RIGHT DIRECTION- WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT TO WRITE A NEW NARRATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TODAY I ASKED FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO WITH A STRONG AYE VOTE. ON SIXTEEN- EIGHT TWENTY ONE SEASON I HAVE TOO MANY SIXTEEN. THANK YOU OF THE BILL THANK YOU. JUDGE RECOMMENDED THE AGUINALDO STAR MISTER CHAIRMAN APOLOGIZE WE HAVE FOUR THOUSAND SIGNATURES- THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN PAGES OF PEOPLE SIGNING SUPPORT OF SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE THAT I WAS GOING TO LIBERTY OFFICES BUT AS WITH THE SHOW YOU. THANK YOU IT'S GOOD TO SHOW THERE'S NO NEED TO KILL A TREE. WHAT THAT'S AN AB SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE BY SEVEN OVER GIPSON THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER HI LACKEY. LACKEY NEL BONTA. BONTA HI BRIAN. BRIAN I WORK. SANTIAGO SANTIAGO I SEYARTO SEE OUR TURN NOW. IT MEASURES OR CALL NEEDS ONE MORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK EVERYBODY. NOW MR HOLDEN YOU HAVE TO BILLS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE ITEM NUMBER EIGHTY NINE. AB TWENTY EIGHTY FIVE HOLDEN CRIMES MANDATED REPORTERS SIX THIRTY TWO HOLDEN. SEGREGATED CONFIDE. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO GET THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB TWENTY FIVE WILL ADDRESS THE OVER SURVEILLANCE AND OVER REPRESENT OVER REPRESENTATION OF FAMILIES OF COLOR IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM BY REFORMING MANDATED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ORIGINALLY CREATED TO MANDATE PHYSICIANS TO REPORT PHYSICAL ABUSE. AND OVER THE YEARS THESE REPORTING LAWS HAVE EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF REPORTABLE CHILD ABUSE AND PERSONS REQUIRED TO REPORT. ALTHOUGH WE ALL INTENDED DATA SHOWS THAT MANDATED REPORTING LAWS DO NOT PREVENT CHILDREN FROM EXPERIENCING ABUSE. AND THE HIGH VOLUME OF CALLS THAT THE CHILD WELFARE HOTLINE RECEIVES HAS CREATED UNIMAGINABLE CASELOADS FOR SOCIAL WORKERS. THE HIGHEST RATE OF CALLS THAT COME INTO THE CHILD PROTECTION HOTLINE OR THE CATCH ALL CATEGORY OF GENERAL NEGLECT IN THIS CATEGORY PRIMARILY CAPTURES CASES OF POVERTY AND ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE THEY CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY RESOLVED BY THE DIRECT SERVICES OFFERED BY CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES. CHILDREN OF COLOR ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE REPORTED FOR ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT DESPITE THE MAJORITY OF ALLEGATIONS GOING UNSUBSTANTIATED. NOT ONLY DOES THIS RESULT IN UNNECESSARY OVER SURVEILLANCE OF FAMILIES WHO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN BUT LACK RELIABLE ACCESS TO CONCRETE RESOURCES IT ALSO BURDENS TO AN ALREADY OVERWHELM SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY FAMILIES ENTERING AND INTERACTING WITH CPS RESULTS IN UNDUE TRAUMA TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN OFTEN CAUSING NEGLECT NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. I HAVE ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND HAVE AMENDED THE BILL TO DO THE FOLLOWING. RETAIN CURRENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR GENERAL NEGLECT AND ABUSE. RETAIN EXISTING DEFINITIONS OF IMMINENT HARM AND REASONABLE SUSPICIONS. THEREFORE THIS BILL WILL SIMPLY AMEND THE CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT REPORTING ACT TO CLARIFY THAT PARENTS ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE DOES NOT TRIGGER GENERAL NEGLECT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL INSTEAD DIRECTS MANDATED REPORTERS TO USE THEIR DISCRETION AND TRAINING TO DETERMINE WHETHER FAMILIES NEED TO BE REPORTED TO CHILD WELFARE SERVICES OR IF THEY SIMPLY NEED TO BE CONNECTED WITH COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. BY DOING SO FAMILIES ON THE VERGE OF BEING CHILD WELFARE CASES CAN AVOID BEING SUBJECTED TO SURVEILLANCE BY CPS WHILE RECEIVING FAMILY STABILIZATION RESOURCES IN A MORE TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE MANNER. THESE CHANGES PROVIDE MANDATED REPORTERS WITH CLEAR GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING CASES THAT ARE LEGITIMATELY IN NEED OF CHILD WELFARE INTERVENTION WHILE REDUCING TRAUMA IN FAMILIES AND UTILIZING MORE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES TO MEET FAMILY NEEDS. ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ARE CHELSEA REUSS A USE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY OVER REPORTING AND DR KELLY FONG AT A SO THE SYSTEM PROFESSOR SOCIOLOGY WITH THE GEORGIA INSTITUTE.

HI MY NAME IS JENNY PEARLMAN I'M WITH AN ORGANIZATION AND FAITH AND FOUND WHICH IS CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION ORGANIZATION IN SAN FRANCISCO AND WE ARE THE CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION COUNCIL FOR SAN FRANCISCO. I'M I'M SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION OF THE BALLOT CURRENTLY RIGHT ABSOLUTELY THE PORT THE BILL'S INTENT TO REDUCE THE OVER REPORTING OVER SURVEILLANCE RELATED TO ISSUES OF POVERTY- WHICH IS NOT A REPORTABLE ISSUE HERE- TO CHILD WELFARE WHAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD- BUT AS YOU'VE WRITTEN THE LANGUAGE THAT. PROVIDES AN EXCEPTION TO THIS ALLOWING- SAYING THAT IT IS A GROUP MANDATED REPORT IF THERE IS-ARE THERE ARE SERVICES AVAILABLE AND THE FAMILY REFUSES SERVICES. WE ALL KNOW THAT FAMILIES DO NOT SEEK SERVICES MULTIPLE REASONS INCLUDING THEIR- IMMIGRATION STATUS THEIR PRIOR NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH SERVICES. OVER SURVEILLANCE BE RACISM. THAT EXIST.

GO AHEAD DO YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL YEAH SORRY ABOUT THAT AND THANK YOU ALL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU% TODAY SO. MY NAME IS KELLY FONG I'M AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE THEOLOGY AND CHURCH ATTACK AND I SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHTY FIVE AS AMENDED BECAUSE BASED ON MY EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. I THINK THIS LEGISLATION AS A WAY TO IMPROVE CHILD WELL BEING IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME CHILDREN. SO OUR GOAL SHOULD BE ENSURING CHILDREN'S SAFETY RATHER THAN CREATING PDF REPORTS FOR THE SAKE OF CREATING REPORT. IN MY RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT EXCLUDING SITUATIONS OF POVERTY FROM REPORTING MANDATE. ACTUALLY MAKES CHILDREN WORKSPACE AND BEFORE I GET INTO HOW THE LEGISLATION WILL DO THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MANDATED REPORTERS. CAN STILL REPORT ANY SITUATION THEY FEEL ARE CONCERNING. INTEREST LEGISLATION SIMPLY CLARIFIED THAT THEY CAN USE THEIR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN SITUATIONS RELATED TO POVERTY. SO THEY CAN BRING CONCERNS IT'S CAN IN REDUCE AND- REPORT. HOW DOES THAT HELP CHILDREN THE FIRST AS A MEMBER HOLDEN INDICATED. IT CAN REDUCE FAMILY STRESS SO AS MOTHERS I INTERVIEWED SHARED WITH ME. AT THE REALLY CARE AND- IN THEMSELVES EVEN WHEN THEY'RE PROMPTLY CLOSED- SECOND AS THE PARTY STATED AS WELL HIS WORKERS ARE ALREADY FRIENDS. AND SO REDUCING UNNECESSARY REPORT CAN FOCUSED FOR HER ATTENTION ON HIGHER RISK CASES. AND THIRD REDUCING UNNECESSARY REPORTS CAN ENCOURAGE AND MAINTAIN FAMILY CONNECTIONS WITH NEEDED RESOURCES. CHOI INTERVIEWED MANY PARENTS WHO REPORTED BY MANDATED REPORTER AND OVER HALF OF THEM DESCRIBE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THEY WERE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SUPPORTERS EVEN WHEN PPL DID NOT IDENTIFY THE KEY CONCERNS. SO AFTER REPORTS MON WHICH DOCTORS THEY CANCELED SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS THAT CHANGE SCHOOL. EVEN PROACTIVELY ANTICIPATING POTENTIAL REPORTS FROM MANDATED REPORTERS THEY HAD THE DATA TO SHARE THINGS LIKE HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH IN. THE DENSELY CUTTING OFF CRITICAL SOURCES OF SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN AND I PROVIDED SOME EXAMPLES IN THE LETTER OF SUPPORT THAT I SUBMITTED. SO AND I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT EIGHTY TWENTY EIGHTY FIVE AS AMENDED TO PROMOTE THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU IN EIGHTEEN T.

THE LACK OF HUMAN CONTACT AND ENLISTMENT MARC MONOTONY CAUSES DEEP DEPRESSION PARANOIA AND SOME EVEN SUFFER HALLUCINATIONS OTHERS EXPERIENCE LARGE FLUCTUATIONS IN WEIGHT AND CHRONIC PAIN AND DUE TO ITS EXTREME EXTREMELY RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS EITHER GO UNTREATED OR ARE MISTREATED. AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY TWO PROVIDES A CLEAR DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES SOLITARY CONFINEMENT ACROSS ALL FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND IMPOSES STRICT LIMITS ON HOW IT CAN BE USED. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WILL PROHIBIT THE USE OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR AUDIBLE POPULATIONS SUCH AS PREGNANT WOMEN AND THOSE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. TO STATE THE OBVIOUS PEOPLE WHO NEED SPECIALIZED CARE SHOULD NOT BE LOCKED IN A ROOM THE SIZE OF A KING SIZE BED WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED. AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY TWO PER ALSO PROVIDES IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. AN EXAMPLE. CURRENT REGULATIONS ALLOW THE USE OF FOOD AND NUTRITION AS AN ADDITIONAL LEVER OF PUNISHMENT FOR CONFINED INDIVIDUALS THIS BILL DISALLOWS THAT. MANY TIMES WE LIKE TO BOAST THE CALIFORNIA THAT AS CALIFORNIA GOES SO GOES THE NATION BUT WE ARE BEHIND IN SETTING CLEAR STANDARDS ON THE USE OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. SEVERAL STATES INCLUDING NEW YORK AND COLORADO HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THIS CRITICAL STEP. CALIFORNIA'S JOIN THE STATE'S IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO SET CLEAR STANDARDS AND LIMITS ON THE USE OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. THIS BEGINS BY RECOGNIZING THAT PROLONGED SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IS TORTURE AND SETTING UNIFORM AND CONSISTENT LIMITS ON HOW SOLITARY CONFINEMENT ISSUES IS AN ALL DETENTION FACILITIES. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SIX TWENTY SIX THIRTY TWO IS ERIC HARRIS WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND KEVIN MCCARTY WHO WILL SPEAK TO THE IMPACT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT HAS HAD ON HIS LIFE. AHMED YAZAN IS ALSO HERE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ON THE BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. GETTING GENERALLY GET FIVE MINUTES AND WHERE WERE YOU GOING TO BREAK IT UP IS FINE. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. A STATEWIDE NONPROFIT PROTECTION ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF ALL PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN THE STATE. WE ARE PART OF A COALITION OF PROUD CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY TWO. WE WORK IN JAILS JUVENILE FACILITIES AND DETENTION CENTERS TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY ISOLATION AND SEGREGATION AND SECURE ADEQUATE MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IS TORTURE AND A PRIORITY ISSUE FOR DRC BECAUSE OF ITS HARMFUL IMPACT ON DISABLED PEOPLE WHO AS A GROUP ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY SUBJECT TO ITS USE. WE'VE LITIGATED OBTAIN CONSENT DECREES WITH JAILS AND AGO SHARED WITH IMMIGRATION DETENTION OPERATORS TO LIMIT ITS USE. MOST RECENTLY WE SERVED ON THE EXECUTIVE STEERING STEERING COMMITTEE AND WORKING GROUPS OF THE BOARD AND STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS FOR THE TITLE FIFTEEN JAILS REGULATION REVISION TO LIMIT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. BUT WERE UNABLE TO GET THE NECESSARY REFORMS THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS A STATEWIDE COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION TO END THE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN JAILS PRISONS AND IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IS A PRACTICE THAT DOES NOT REHABILITATE BUT CAUSES HARM ESPECIALLY TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO MANAGE VIOLENCE IN A IN CORSO. AND CARCERAL SETTINGS. RATHER SOLITARY CONFINEMENT EXACERBATES THESE ISSUES RESEARCH SHOWS THE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT DOES NOT MAKE JAILS OR PRISONS SAFER NOR DOES IT IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCOMES BECAUSE EXPOSURE TO SOLITARY CONFINEMENT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO INCREASE RECIDIVISM IN SOME CASES. THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL ALSO VIEW SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AS A RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUE. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IS MOST OFTEN USED AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR ESPECIALLY BLACK AND LATIN NEXT PEOPLE. ALTHOUGH THE STATISTICS ARE NOT RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC RESEARCHERS ESTIMATE THAT BETWEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND 90% OF PEOPLE IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR TWO A BILL THAT WOULD BAN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SUCH AS INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES PREGNANT WOMEN YOUTH AND THE ELDERLY. PROHIBIT LONG TERM SOLITARY SEGREGATED CONFINEMENT BY LIMITING THE TIME SPENT IN CONFINEMENT TO NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN DAYS CONSECUTIVE DAYS OR FORTY DAYS AND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAY PERIOD. AND REQUIRE FACILITIES TO KEEP CLEAR RECORDS OF THE USE OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BELIEVE THAT WE CAN COME TO A COMMON GROUND ON THIS BILL. CALIFORNIA WOULD JOIN OTHER STATES LIKE NEW YORK AND COLORADO WHICH HAVE PASSED SIMILAR BILLS. AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY TWO WOULD HELP CALIFORNIA SET CLEAR STANDARDS AND LIMITS ON THE USE OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN JAILS PRISONS AND DETENTION CENTERS. THANK YOU AND WE REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU GOOD. GREETINGS HONORABLE CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS KEVIN MCCARTHY I'M AN UNDERGRADUATE OF LEGAL STUDIES AND A MEMBER OF THE UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS AT UC BERKELEY I SPENT A TOTAL OF TWENTY TWO YEARS INCARCERATED AND ROUGHLY TWELVE YEARS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT INCLUDING TWO YEARS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AS A JUVENILE. MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT TOOK PLACE WHEN I WAS SENT TO THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY. I NEED TREATMENT FOR ADDICTION BUT INSTEAD WAS GIVEN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. ONCE A WEEK WE WERE GIVEN ONE NOVEL FIVE PIECES OF PAPER AND A PENCIL. TALKING TO OUR NEIGHBORS WHILE IN OURSELVES WAS PROHIBITED WE CAN ONLY TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE WHEN WE WERE GIVEN ONE HOUR OUTSIDE IN THE EXERCISE CAGE. USUALLY I FINISH MY WEEKLY NOVEL IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND BECAME SO DESPERATE TO TALKING HERE SOUND. THAT WOULD ASK MYSELF QUESTIONS AND THEN RESPOND OUT LOUD. I WOULD ALSO RECITE EVERY MEMORY THAT I COULD REMEMBER SENSE BIRTH JUST AS A WAY TO GET MY MIND TO DO SOMETHING. SOMETIMES I WOULD JUST SIT THERE AND CRY OUT OF FRUSTRATION. ALL GOING TO SPEND A TOTAL OF TWENTY THREE MONTHS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT BEFORE I WAS PAROLED. BUT NOT BEFORE I SAW TWO PEOPLE COMMIT SUICIDE IN SOLITARY IN MANY OTHERS MAKE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. ONCE I WAS OUT I FELT SO MUCH ANGER AND ANIMOSITY ESPECIALLY TOWARDS FIGURES OF AUTHORITY. I AVOIDED PEOPLE AND DID NOT LIKE TALKING TO ANYONE. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IS A VICIOUS ASSAULT UPON ONE'S PSYCHE AND SOUL. IT IS A FORM OF SPIRITUAL EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE. HOW CAN WE PROHIBIT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE UNDER THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT BUT NOT STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST THE MINE. I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A PHYSICAL BEATING IN LIEU OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. BRUISES AND CUTS ON MY BODY HEAL BUT THE ONES IN MY MIND AND SOUL HAVE ONLY BECOME INFECTED AND CONTINUE TO HARM ME. WHEN I WAS IN SOLITARY THE GUARD'S FAVORITE RESPONSE WAS THEY DON'T MAKE THE LAW THEY JUST FOLLOW IT. THIS LEGISLATURE MAKES THE LAW AND HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO STOP TORTURE. AND SAVE LIVES THROUGH THIS BILL I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY HAS A TESTAMENT TO THE HORSS SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND ALSO AS PROOF THAT PEOPLE CAN CHANGE THEIR LIVES. THERE IS NOTHING THAT THE STATE CAN DO TO RESTORE ME AND OTHER VICTIMS OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. BUT THIS LEGISLATURE CAN PROTECT FUTURE GENERATIONS FROM EXPERIENCING THIS PERMANENT HARM RGS COMMITTEE TO GIVE A YES VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPER COURT NAME AN ORGANIZATION. MARCO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. KAREN MEMBER SALLY HANDED ON WITH WHAT I MEAN TO REPRESENT NEXT IN CALIFORNIA PROUD SPONSORS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THAT HASHEM IS YOUR FIRST MY DRESSES CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. JACKIE GONZALEZ IMMIGRANT DEFENSE ADVOCATES A PROUD CO SPONSOR ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER AND CALIFORNIA INDIVISIBLE STAYED STRONG THANK YOU. SERIK ME ON BEHALF OF INITIATE JUSTICE A PROUD CO SPONSOR IN STRONG SUPPORT. MARGOT MENDELSON WITH PRISON LAW OFFICE A PROUD CO SPONSOR IN SUPPORT. GLENN BACKUS ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN STRONG SUPPORT. FRED WILLIAMS ACLU CONTACTS IN IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU NOW WE HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. A WITNESS OPPOSITION ROOM AT JENNIFER COULD YOU MAKE ROOM SO THEY CAN MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MATTHEW EASILY RIP SINGING CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY TWO. THE REGARDING SEGREGATED CONFINEMENT. CCPOA HAS MAJOR ISSUES WITH THE LIMITATIONS ON SEGREGATED CONFINEMENT THAT ARE CONTAINED IN AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY TWO. THESE LIMITATIONS MAY CREATE SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES FOR OUR OFFICERS AND THE INMATES WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM. MOST OF THE INVOLUNTARY PLACEMENTS IN WHAT IS CURRENTLY REFERRED TO AS ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION OR SECURITY HOUSING UNITS ARE INMATES WHO HAVE COMMITTED NEW SERIOUS INFRACTIONS WHICH ARE TYPICALLY VIOLENT CRIMES SUCH AS ASSAULT MURDER RAPE OR ATTEMPT THEREOF. WELL INCARCERATED. FORCING THE DEPARTMENT TO RELEASE THESE INDIVIDUALS FROM SEGREGATED CONFINEMENT AFTER ONLY FIFTEEN DAYS. COULD PLACE OUR OFFICERS AND OTHER INMATES AT SERIOUS RISK OF HARM. THAT POTENTIAL RISK ONLY INCREASES WITH THE BILL MAXIMIZING ITS USE TO NO MORE THAN FORTY FIVE DAYS WITHIN A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY PERIOD. THE BILL GOES FAR BEYOND TARGETED REFORMS TO ADDRESS ANY MISUSES OF SEGREGATED CONFINEMENT. AND THROWS OUT ANY EFFECTIVE USE NO MATTER THE REASON FOR PLACEMENT. WHEN INMATE SHOWS A PROPENSITY FOR CONTINUED VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHER INMATES FORCING THEM BACK INTO THE GENERAL POPULATION TOO EARLY. WILL ONLY RESULT IN FURTHER A FURTHER VIOLENCE PERPETRATED ON INMATES AND CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. INMATES WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED OR SUCCEEDED IN MURDERING THEIR CELLMATES WOULD HAVE TO BE PLACED BACK INTO THE POPULATION TO WHICH THEY POSE A RISK. AS FAR AS OUR OFFICERS ARE CONCERNED EVEN WHEN TACK ATTACKS ARE NOT DIRECTED AT THE OFFICERS. ANY VIOLENCE WITHIN A PRISON FACILITY POSES A DANGER TO THEM WHEN THEY INTERVENE. IT STANDS TO REASON THAT REMOVING EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS FROM ACCESS TO THEIR POTENTIAL VICTIMS. PROMOTES A MORE GENERALLY STABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR EVERYONE ELSE INMATES AND OFFICERS ALIKE. ANOTHER TROUBLING RESULT OF AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY TWO IS THE INABILITY OF CDCR TO VOLUNTARILY PLACE AN INMATE AND SEGREGATED CONFINEMENT FOR THEIR PROTECTION AGAINST KNOWN THREATS TO THEIR LIVES. THE BILL ONLY ALLOWS FOR PLACEMENT INTO ANOTHER UNIT OR AREA OF THE FACILITY. THIS MAY BE FOR THAT SUFFICIENT IN SOME CASES BUT IF AN INMATE HAS BEEN DESIGNATED BY PRESENTING TO BE KILLED. MOVING INTO ANOTHER AREA OF THE PRISON IS FAR FROM A GUARANTEE OF PROTECTION. UNFORTUNATELY THE REGION INFLUENCE OF SOME PRISON GNGS WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE THE PERSON AT RISK. IT WILL NOT TAKE LONG FOR THE ORDER TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE PRISON IN IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES SEGREGATED CONFINEMENT IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THEIR PROTECTION. IN THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THAT EVEN AT THE REQUEST OF THE INMATES. THE NEW AN OVERLY BROAD DEFINITION OF SEGREGATED CONFINEMENT. INCLUDES THE CONFINEMENT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND A CELL OR SIMILARLY SIMILARLY CONFINED HOLDING OR LIVING SPACE ALONE OR WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS. WITH SEVERELY RESTRICTED ACTIVITY MOVEMENT OR SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN THIS GOES WAY BEYOND WHAT IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERED AS ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION. OR SECURITY HOUSING UNITS OR ANY OF THE OTHER. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY WITH SOLITARY CONFINEMENT- AND IT ALSO INCLUDES INMATES SUFFERING FROM SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES THAT ARE PLACED IN SHORT AND LONG TERM MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BEDS. SO I KNOW IT'S NOT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT THAT THE BILL COULD POTENTIALLY ALSO SEVERELY LIMIT THE TYPE OF CARE THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE. WOULD WOULD FORCE THE DEPARTMENT TO PLACE THEM BACK INTO A LESS RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT WHERE SOME INMATES MAY BE A GREATER. DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. AND I'VE SEEN SOME OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THEY DO MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BILL BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE OUR POSITION. AND THE AUTHOR IN HIS OFFICE HAVE BEEN VERY COMMUNICATIVE THE- WITH- OUR ASSOCIATION SO DEFINITELY DO APPRECIATE THAT. WE DO HAVE A PRETTY DIFFICULT HURDLE TO OVERCOME WITH THE BASELINE ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS ON THE DURATION OF SEGREGATED CONFINEMENT IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT DID PROVISIONS FOR NOW OF TWENTY SIX THIRTY TWO ARE FAR TOO RESTRICTIVE AND LIMIT THE ABILITY OF STAFF AND MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OFFICERS AND INMATES AND FOR THESE REASONS CCPOA. IS A POST THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU MAY BEGIN GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN RESOLUTION MUCH FOR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. I RESPECTFULLY AND OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY TWO. AS A GENERAL MATTER WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IMPOSING ON THE SIGNIFICANT MANDATES AND STATUTE. S. CENTRAL ROLE OF THE BOARD OF THE ESTATE AND COMMITTEE CORRECTIONS IS TO SET MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR. CUSTODIAL FACILITIES ADOPTING AND REVISING THESE MINIMUM STANDARDS IS AN ONGOING PROCESS. THAT INVOLVES STAKEHOLDERS FROM ALL PERSPECTIVES AND ALLOWS FOREIGN FOR EVOLUTION AND REFINEMENT OF REQUIREMENTS AND PROCESSES. WITHOUT THE BURDEN OF HAVING TO AMEND STATUTE. EVERY TIME IT CHANGES NEEDED. THE B. S. C. AND THE PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPERVISION. HOUSING AND REHABILITATION OF INCARCERATED PERSONS ARE BEST SITUATED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT BEST PRACTICES AND FACILITY STANDARDS. WHAT SPECIFICALLY THE RESTRICTIONS IN THIS BILL WOULD PRECLUDE MANY IF NOT MOST OFFENDERS FROM BEING CONFINED IN A WAY THAT MEETS THE BILL'S DEFINITION. THE TERM SPECIAL POPULATION WHICH IS THE TRIGGER FOR THE GENERAL PROHIBITS XIN ON THE USE OF SEGREGATED CONFINEMENT INCLUDES PERSONS UNDER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER THAN FORTY NINE- PRECHT AN AMPLE SUPPORT PARDON PERSONS AS ALREADY MENTIONED LGBT Q. PLUS PERSONS OR PERSONS WHO EXPERIENCED CHILDHOOD TRAUMA OR TRAUMA THAT OTHERWISE CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR ARREST. CONVICTION OR DETENTION BEYOND THAT THE BILL'S ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WILL PARTICULAR. PRACTICALLY ELIMINATE ANY USE ARE SEGREGATED CONFINEMENT INCLUDING WHEN SUCH PLACEMENT IS NECESSARY AS ALREADY MENTIONED. FOR THE SAFETY OF THE FACILITY OR INDIVIDUAL AND MAKES THEMSELVES. FINALLY THE BILL REQUIRES ALL FACILITIES TO PLACE INDIVIDUALS IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE HOUSING POSSIBLE THIS MANDATE WILL ABSOLUTELY RESULT IN PLACEMENTS THAT ARE UNSAFE TO OTHER INMATES AND STAFF AND ECLIPSE ALL OF THE OTHER CLASSIFICATION DECISIONS THAT MUST BE MADE WHEN DECIDING HOW TO USE BECAUSE STILL THE RESOURCES. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. WHEN I BRING IT BACK. DO NOT HERE FOR OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN A ROOM AND OUTSIDE IN THE HALLWAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALL IN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE REPRESENTS FROM STATE SHARES AND CCPOA THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I'D ALSO LIKE TO RECOGNIZE MR MCCARTY ARTIST CORPORATE YA- I DID HAVE A QUESTION I'M SORRY I MISSED TALKING TO YOU LOOK I THINK YOUR BILL AND ALL SPORTING A TODAY IS GREAT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY. BUT THERE'S A FEW INDIVIDUALS WHO I THINK. YOU KNOW PEOPLE OF KILTER CELLMATE OUR PEOPLE ARE GENERAL AND DE DANGER OF GENERAL POPULATION WHERE- HEY. THERE'S I THINK THEY HAVE TO HAVE SPECIAL COULD. AND WALLET IN THEORY THAT CAN BE DONE IN YOUR BILL BY EXTENDING THE FIFTEEN DAYS REPEATEDLY I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S A GOOD WAY. TO DO THIS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THE CRITERIA FOR THIS- I'D JUST LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE SPECIFICITY ON WHAT YOU DO WITH PEOPLE WHO REALLY CAN'T BE RELEASED AND IT MAY BE ONLY YOU KNOW ONCE A YEAR THIS HAS TO BE LOOKED AT HER. HOPEFULLY NEVER BUT I DO THINK THAT REQUIRES A BIT MORE WORK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE THAT GOOD THE NEW MAKE CLOTHES NOW THANK YOU- FIRST ALLIED TO YOUR POINT- YOU KNOW WE'RE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMMITTEE AND WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES- INPUT AND WE APPRECIATE AND THAT'S WHY THESE HEARINGS OR PART OF THE PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN AS WE ARE MOVING THE BILL FORWARD OR IN A PLACE WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN. MAKE IT EVEN BETTER- YOUR COMMENTS ARE LOST I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. MIGHTY AND I THINK WE'VE ALSO BEEN MADE AN OFFER TO THE COMMITTEE THAT WILL BE VISITING NEW FOLSOM ON WEDNESDAY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACTUALLY SEEING- WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF TESTIMONY AND APPRECIATE MR MCCARTY'S- A PICTURE IN OF. PARTICULAR ENCOUNTER- IT IS THE IT IS THE UNDERPINNING OF WHY THIS BILL IS IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE. ARE YET TO FIND A PERFECT BILL. AND I'VE SENT THE IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE- BUT- THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM HERE. THERE'S A DYSFUNCTIONAL SYSTEM. THAT PEOPLE ARE FINDING THEMSELVES TRAPPED IN AND I'M NOT. SAYING THAT THIS BILL IS SOME BECAUSE WE EVEN HAVE IN IT THERE WERE LEAST RESTRICTIVE HOUSING. POSSIBLE HAS BEEN STRICKEN FROM THE BILL SO EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT IT DOES NOT IT HAS BEEN. SO WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT. AND WE WANT. OF THOSE WHO WERE GUARDS. WHO WERE IN HIS PRESENCE TO BE SAFE WE WANT. IN MAYES OTHER INMATES IN THE PRISON AND STAFF. TO BE SAFE AND WE HAVE TRIED TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THOSE CONCERNS IN THOSE ISSUES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE JUST TRYING TO ALSO MIRROR BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. SO WE'RE NOT EVEN. TRYING TO CREATE SOMETHING SUPER BRAND NEW HERE. WE'RE RECOGNIZING. LEADERSHIP AROUND THE RECORD. ESALA CONFINE BEING TO. AND WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE POLICIES THAT ARE FAIR- AND RESPONSIVE TO THAT REAL ISSUE. AND THE TRAUMA THAT IT CREATES ISRAEL. I HAD A STORY THAT I WAS GOING TO CLOSE WITH AND ENSURING WITH YOU BUT I THINK MR MCCARTY STORY. IS OF IS WANT THAT TO BE MY LAST WORD. WE WILL CONTINUE IN THIS PROCESS. WE HOPE THAT THOSE OF YOU HAVE ARE OPEN TO VISITING WITH US AND THERE'S A NEW FOLSOM. OF SO WE ALL SEE TOGETHER MANY OF YOU PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE. BUT WE ARE TRYING TO TALK TO FOLKS THERE TO TRY TO GET CLARITY ON HOW WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT. ALL INTERESTED PARTIES A CONCERNS ARE BEST REPRESENTED. THE BOTTOM LINE IS FOLKS WHO ARE BEING SUBJECTED TO THIS KIND OF WHAT WE WILL CALL IN HUMANE TREATMENT DOES NOT ELIMINATED. BUT IT PUTS WE THINK SOME APPROPRIATE STANDARDS IN PLACE THAT MAYOR COLORADO NEW YORK NEW JERSEY AND THE INTERNATIONAL. COMMUNITY SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IPHONE THE BILL. THANK MOTION AND SECOND- BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THAT THE REAL PROBLEM. IT IS NOT REALLY SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. IS THE ABUSE OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT BY BOTH THE PRISON GUARDS. NCDC ARE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOESN'T TAKE EFFECT. THE LONG STANDING. HARM BED IT DOES TO PRISONERS. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY CARE. AND WHEN THEY DECIDED TO GO TO PUT SOMEBODY IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. FORD INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT PRISONER AND THEY JUST TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE INMATE THERE. AND IT'S GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL- I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS PUTTING IN SOME BATTERIES SAFEGUARDS BUT COMING UP WITH SOME. METHODOLOGY FOR WHY YOU DO IT OR WHY YOU DON'T DO IT- AS OPPOSED TO JUST LEAVING IT UP TO THE WHIMS OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING. THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE INCARCERATED AND SO- I'M- RECOMMENDED I BOTH. YEAH ON AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY TWO BY THE MEMBER HOLDEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER HI LACKEY LACKEY NEL BONTA BONTA HI BRIAN HI BRIAN HIGH COURT.

NOT ONLY DO THEY DETERMINE THE CRIME SOMEONE IS CHARGED WITH BUT ALSO WILL BE DETAINED OR RELEASED PRE TRIAL WHETHER THEY'RE CONVICTED OF THE CRIMES HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH AND HOW SOMEONE SCHOOL HISTORY MAY IMPACT THEIR TREATMENT JUST TO NAME A FEW EXAMPLES. YET DESPITE THIS GREAT AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE VERY FEW JEEZ PUBLICLY REPORT MUCH ABOUT THEIR CHARGING RATIONALE THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES THE CASE MOVED TO THE PROCESS AND THE NUMBER OF CERTAIN CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN CHARGE. THIS LACK OF INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY IS ONLY ENABLED RACIAL BIAS PROLIFERATE WITHIN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE A CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM OF PEOPLE OF COLOR VASTLY OVER REPRESENTED IN CALIFORNIA'S PRISON AND JAIL POPULATIONS.

IN THE END- WE CAN FLY OKAY A BUT WE WILL CAN. FOR WHAT WOULD YOU IN A AT THE MISTER KILEY CERROS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS AS OF YOUR PAY- THERE TO PRESENT ON AB TWENTY. SIXTIES A. TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN ENCOURAGES RESTRAINT IN THE OVER RELIANCE ON INCARCERATION BY REQUIRING COURTS TO CONSIDER OTHER ALTERNATIVES IN SENTENCING DECISIONS. WHILE EXISTING LAW CONTAINS NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES VERY FEW SECTIONS NEITHER LIMIT NOR DISCOURAGE INCARCERATION AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT. THE LACK OF THIS LACK OF DIRECTION AS PER CALIFORNIA BEHIND STATES SUCH AS ALABAMA ARKANSAS MINNESOTA TENNESSEE AND NEW YORK ALL OF WHICH ALREADY REQUIRE SENTENCES TO BE THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS POSSIBLE OR THE CASE IN NEW YORK. EXPLICITLY STATED THE MINIMAL AMOUNT OF CONFINEMENT SHOULD BE IMPOSED. SUCH PRACTICES ARE IN LINE WITH SEVERAL CASE STUDIES AT APPOINTED TOWARDS EVIDENCE OF DIVERSION BEING EFFECTIVE METHOD AND DISK TO CREASING FUTURE CONVICTIONS. FURTHERMORE ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION OF BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO REDUCE PRISON AND JAIL COSTS LOWER RECIDIVISM RATES ARE ONE WAY TO ADDRESS HARMFUL RACIAL DISPARITIES COME A JUSTICE SYSTEM I SAW THIS FIRST HAND. IN MY LIVING YEARS W. PUBLIC DEFENDER HALF WHICH I SPENT IN DRUG COURT AND ACTUALLY SAW THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES OF CHOOSING REHABILITATION AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE OVER SIMPLY INCARCERATING INDIVIDUALS. OVERALL BY REQUIRING COURTS PRESIDING OVER A COUPLE MATTER TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES INCARCERATION. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN SHIPS CALIFORNIA AWAY FROM AN OVERLY PUNITIVE SYSTEM. THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WAS RE TOWARDS REHABILITATION APRS RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND OTHER DIVERSION PROGRAMS. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION INITIATE JUSTICE AND THE NATIONAL. OF SOCIAL WORKERS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OUR AGE ANA GRIFFITH ON BEHALF OF INITIATE JUSTICE AND AS A TECHNICAL WITNESS RICK OWENS SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY WITH COMMITTEE ON REVISION. OF THE PENAL CODE. YEAH THANK YOU. FIVE MINUTES OR BOTH WITNESSES. IN MORNING GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN. MY NAME IS ADRIANA GRIFFITH AND I AM PLEASED TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN. I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL BECAUSE NOT ONLY AM I DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY INCARCERATION BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT I DO EVERY DAY IS ROOTED IN RESTORATIVE AND TRANSFORMATIVE JUSTICE. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN IS A MUCH NEEDED ADDITION TO CALIFORNIA'S PENAL CODE. AND ENCOURAGING ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION WILL NOT ONLY SAVE THE STATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BUT ALSO PROVIDE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WITH BETTER OUTCOMES WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC SAFETY. IN BOTH MY PROFESSIONAL LIVED EXPERIENCE I'VE SEEN THE POWERFUL EFFECT THE DIVERSION AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAMS HAVE ON INDIVIDUALS. AS AN EXAMPLE AND SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY WE CREATED A DIVERSION PROGRAM IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THE WOMEN'S CENTER YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES AND OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR PROSTITUTION RELATED OFFENSES. THIS PROGRAM OFFERS INDIVIDUALS A WAY TO LEARN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF HARMS CAUSED BY SEXUAL EXPLOITATION TRAFFICKING BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY. PROGRAM OFFERS A WAY TO ALLOW THE M. THE HARMS CAUSED EXPLOITATION. IN THE OFFERS THE WAY TO LEARN FROM THE AND MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGES MOVING FORWARD. INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM ARE OFFERED RESOURCES TO ASSIST THEM WITH BASIC NEEDS AS WELL AS CONTINUED PEER SUPPORT AND REFERRALS FOR ADDITIONAL COUNSELING AND THERAPY SERVICES. MORE RECENTLY SAID KING COUNTY HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAM FOR LOW LEVEL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES ALSO IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND WHICH I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BEING ONE OF THE CASE MANAGERS IN THAT. GRAHAM THE PAST FORTY YEARS HAVE SHOWN THE IN CARS ASIAN IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST OR MOST EFFECTIVE TOOL TO DEAL WITH HARM. WE MUST CONSIDER AND INVEST IN ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION IF WE WANT TO BREAK OUT OF THE HARMFUL CYCLES OF MASS INCARCERATION AND DISRUPT CYCLES OF VIOLENCE AND HARM. FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO PASS AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU YOU MAY BEGIN SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RICK- AND I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY FOR THE BE ON REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE. THE COMMITTEE RISEN CODE WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE. TWENTY TWELVE. IT MANDATE IS TO RIGOROUSLY STUDY THE EXISTING CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM AND TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO SIMPLIFY AND RATIONALISE THE LAW. OKAY RECOMMENDATION. THIS IS. THE TWENTY ONE SIXTY IS ABOUT GIVING JUDGES GUIDANCE ON WHEN TO IMPOSE A SENTENCE OF INCARCERATION OR WENT TO OPPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION. COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO BETTER RESULTS OF INCARCERATION IN MANY CASES AND ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS WHILE THE PENAL CODE HAS A NUMBER OF SECTIONS THAT REQUIRE JUDGES TO INCARCERATE IT DOES NOT GIVE MUCH GUIDANCE WHEN ALTERNATIVES SERRATION. THERE IS A- HM AND INCARCERATION RATES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OF DATA ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY THE COMMITTEE SHOWED THAT THE RATE OF INCARCERATION PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE RANGE FROM AS LOW AS UNDER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN SOME COUNTIES. TO NEARLY FIVE TIMES THAT AMOUNT IN OTHER COUNTIES AND IN EVERY COUNTY EVEN THOSE THAT HAD LOWER INCARCERATION RATES THERE WERE- SIGNIFICANT RACIAL DISPARITIES IN THE RATES OF INCARCERATION WITH BLACK PEOPLE VASTLY OVER REPRESENTED IN THEIR CARS RATED POPULATION. UP CALIFORNIA CAN ENCOURAGE THE USE OF ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION BY IMPLEMENTING A STATEMENT OF RESTRAINT INTO THE PENAL CODE THAT GIVES JUDGES GUIDANCE ON WHEN INCARCERATED IT IS APPROPRIATE. SUCH STATEMENTS ARE WELL ESTABLISHED- THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL WELL AS WELL AS THE MODEL PENAL CODE HAVE RECOMMENDED ST STE A LOT. AND STILL JURIST INCLUDING NEW YORK AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE SUCH LAWS INCORPORATE INTO IT. A LEGAL TERM THE LOCAL COMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT THIS RECOMMENDATION COULD REDUCE INCARCERATION IN THE STATE WHILE NOT IMPACTING PUBLIC SAFETY AFTER LEAVING JUDGES WITH THE DISCRETION TO INCARCERATE WHEN NECESSARY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE IS IN A LOT LAST FEW YEARS ON- POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND- TRANSPARENCY AS FAR AS INFORMATION THIS THIS ISSUE KIND OF THAT TACKLES BOTH THESE THINGS RELATED DEATHS IN CUSTODY TRANSPARENT PROCESS TO FIND OUT WHEN SOMEBODY DIES. AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WHILE IN CUSTODY SINCE THE L. A. COUNTY JAIL. AS WELL AS DEATH CERTIFICATES- ARE THE PRIMARY DATA SOURCE USED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO TRACK MORTALITIES IN THE NOT ALWAYS. ACCURATE WITH THESE INDICATIONS SO THIS WOULD MAKE SURE THAT- CURRENT LAW CLARIFIES THIS AND WE DON'T HAVE A HOTCH POTCH- SYSTEM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I KNOW OUR OPPOSITION SAYS THIS IS DUPLICATIVE AND SO IF IT IS I GUESS WHAT THE PROBLEM AND BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS MAKE SURE WITH THIS MAKE SURE THAT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE A UNIFORM. A POLICY WITH FOCUSING ON- TRANSPARENCY INFORMATION FOR- FAMILIES WITH SOMEBODY DOES DIE IN CUSTODY. AS WELL AS JUST GOOD GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL I WITH ME TODAY ARE TWO REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE- YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER AND THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION. THANK YOU FOR GOOD AFTERNOON FAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME IS APRIL GRAYSON A POLICY ASSOCIATE FOR THE YOUNG ONES FREEDOM CENTER AND A POLICY FELLOW WITH THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA SO LEAST POLICY INSTITUTE BOTH SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY ONE. A TWENTY. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY ONE REQUIRE A DEATH CERTIFICATE TO INCLUDE IN THE FIELD THAT INDICATES WHEN SOMEONE DIES WHILE IN CUSTODY AT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT FACILITIES TO DISCLOSE TO THE PUBLIC WITH SOMEONE DIES WHILE IN CUSTODY. A. TWENTY TWENTY REPORT TWENTY TWENTY ONE SKEWS ME REPORT BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. FOUND THAT APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE PEOPLE ARE KILLED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IN CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR. HOWEVER AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ONLY REPORTED EIGHTY NINE DEATHS OCCURRED WHILE LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT. NATIONALLY ACCORDING TO RESEARCH PERFORMED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF OFFICER INVOLVED DEATHS WERE UNDERCOUNTED OR MISLABELED. THE DEATH CERTIFICATE IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR MANAGING MORTALITY TRENDS PROVIDING OUTCOME DATA FOR RESEARCH STUDIES AFTER SETTLING. PART OR IS FOR HEALTH RELATED FUNDING RESEARCH AND INTERVENTIONS. INFORMATION ON THE DEATH CERTIFICATE IS ENTERED INTO THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRONIC DEATH REGISTRATION SYSTEM. THIS DATA IS THEN USED TO FORMULATE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICIES TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE DEATH CERTIFICATE CURRENTLY. DOES NOT CURRENTLY CAPTURE WHETHER DEATHS ARE OFFICER INVOLVED BUT WHEN THE DEATH OCCURRED WHILE IN CUSTODY. THE PROCESS FOR CUTTING THAT RELIED ON THE MEDICAL EXAMINER OR CORONER TO INCLUDE THIS INFORMATION. BUT IT'S UP TO THE DISCRETION. WHAT OFTEN GETS SUBMITTED. FURTHERMORE THE PUBLIC CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE A TIMELY ACCESS TO DATA ON DEATHS THAT OCCUR WHILE IN THE CUSTODY OF STATE OR LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. WHILE EXISTING LAW REQUIRES LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES A CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES TO REPORT DEATHS IN CUSTODY FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE AGENCIES TO SET THIS INFORMATION WITH THE PUBLIC OR UPDATE THE POSTING WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AFTER THEY CHANGED INFORMATION. OR DETAILS BEING REPORTED. GREATER TRANSPARENCY IS NEEDED. BY IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S DATA COLLECTION PRACTICES THE TRANSPARENCY PRACTICES THIS BILL WILL ENHANCE COMMUNITIES REST ASSURE ALL DEATHS ARE COUNTING. IT BECAUSE THE DEATHS ARE REPORTED. OR COVER THE POLICY MAKERS WON'T HAVE AN ACCURATE SENSE OF THE NUMBERS OF DEATHS ARE HAPPY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE ASSOCIATED PROBLEMS. I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO PUBLIC POLICY CRISIS. THIS ENTIRE BILL IS ABOUT ENSURING TRANSPARENCY AND THAT CALIFORNIA'S THAT IT'S ACCURATE IS NOT. ABOUT CULPABILITY. WE ARE HERE FOR CHECKBOXES THE NOTIFICATIONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY ONE THANK YOU THAT ON THE MORNING- THAT'S A GOOD IDEA YEAH IT'S IS TO ME WHEN THE MICROPHONES ON ARM SO ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THAT ARE IN THE BUILDING.

THE INFORMATION THAT A PEERS TO BE SOUGHT BY THE PROPONENT PROPONENTS OF THE BILL CAN ALREADY BE ACCESSED FURTHER REQUIRING THIS INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DEATH CERTIFICATE COULD SLOW THE COMPLETION OF THAT DOCUMENT AND TIMELY RELEASE OF THE DEATH CERTIFICATE IS A PARAMOUNT GOAL FOR DEBT INVESTIGATORS. WE NOTE THAT NO DEATHS INVOLVING OTHER PROFESSIONS WOULD TRIGGER AN ANALOGOUS INCLUSION INVESTOR DIFFICULT. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL'S REQUIREMENT TO POST CERTAIN FACTS ABOUT AN IN CUSTODY DEATH ON THE AGENCY'S WEBSITE IS DUPLICATIVE COSTLY AND UNNECESSARY UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT IS UNLIKELY TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION THAT IS NT ALREADY PUBLIC OR ATTAINABLE- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS BUT- WE RESPECTFULLY ASK CONTINUE TO- OPPOSE. ALSO ON BEHALF OF THEIR- CALIFORNIA CORNERS ASSOCIATION- WE HAVE NOT- TAKEN A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE TEN DAY REQUIREMENT HAS NOW BE HAS NOW BEEN EXTENDED. TO THIRTY DAYS ON BAD BAD GUIDELINE IS STILL INSUFFICIENT- FOR- IN MOST CASES DOES- DOES ON DEATH INVESTIGATIONS DO TAKE FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS TO COMPLETE- SO THIRTY DAYS IS A VERY VERY- IT'S NOT UP PROFICIENT SUFFICIENT TIME FOR US TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE- WHAT THE AUTHOR NEEDS NOW FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION.

THAT SAYS THAT THE DEATH WAS CAUSED BY AN OFFICER AND HERE'S WHY. THINGS LIKE THAT OFTEN GO OUR TO COURT BEFORE THEY DECIDE I DON'T THINK IN THIRTY DAYS YOU CAN COME TO THAT NOW WHAT YOU PROBABLY CAN SAY. ON A DEATH CERTIFICATE IS THAT THE AREAS- OFFICER FORCE WAS USED THE PERSON WAS IN CUSTODY. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SAY WHETHER OR NOT IN WELL. IN ALL CASES IN SOME CASES PERHAPS YOU CAN DECIDE IN THIRTY DAYS AND THE OTHERS YOU CAN'T. AND I THINK YOUR BILL SHOULD BE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT BEGINNING THAT WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I THINK THAT'S OUR INTENT IS TO SPECIFY THE DEATH IN CUSTODY. WHETHER IT'S A SIMPLE FACT WHETHER YOU ARE IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY AND YOU DIED ARE YOU DID NOT OKAY THE TIME OUT OF THE CASE ITSELF I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S WHEN THE MAN MANAGEMENT- I'M AN ACCORD THAT THAT'S A DIRECTION ALL RIGHT. SO THEY WON'T. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE REQUIREMENT SAYING THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY THE- OFFICER IN A THIRTY DAY TIME SPAN. MAYBE YOU COULD DO IN A RARE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. BUT YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T DO IT ROUTINELY SO I'LL JUST ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS TIME GOES ON. WE'LL GET. THE GLOBAL. I LAST. SO WHAT YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

TO MAKE KNOWINGLY BUYING OR RECEIVING STOLEN FIREARM A MISDEMEANOR OR A FELONY REGARDLESS OF THE VALUE OF THE FIREARM. THE DATA IS CLEAR. BY THEM VIA VIOLENT CRIMES. INVOLVING FIREARMS HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED DURING THE PANDEMIC. MANY OF THESE CRIMES INVOLVED STOLEN FIREARMS TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM HERE FROM THE STATE CAPITOL INVOLVED A STOLEN FIREARM. CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE STRICTEST GUN LAWS IN THE COUNTRY. BUT ALL THESE LAWS THAT WERE PASSING ARE MEANINGLESS UNLESS THERE ARE MEANINGFUL CONSEQUENCES. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A COMMON SENSE PROPOSAL. TO KNOWINGLY BY A RECEIVE A STOLEN FIREARM KNOWING THAT IT'S A STOLEN FIRE ARM REGARDLESS OF VALUE SHOULD BE TREATED AS A SERIOUS CRIME. MOST GET HAND GUNS YOU CAN CHECK IT ON THE WEBSITE MOST HANDGUNS ARE LESS THAN NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN VALUE. WE NEED TO HAVE MEANINGFUL CONSEQUENCES. TO FIGHT GUN TRAFFICKING. AND DEFY THE SPIKE IN GUN VIOLENCE. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS A SPONSOR. THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION.

INCLUDING THE THEFT OF A FIREARM IF THE VALUE OF THE FIREARM IS UNDER NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS LOWERING THE THEFT OF A FIREARM TO A MISDEMEANOR WAS NOT THEIR INTENTION AND THAT'S WHY ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN- DAY PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE TO FIX ONE OF THE FIREARM LOOPHOLES BY STATING THAT ANY THEFT OF A FIREARM IS NOW A FELONY REGARDLESS OF THE VALUE OF THE FIREARM. EXCEPT THERE IS STILL ONE MODEL MODIFICATION LEFT ARE TO MAKE. AND THAT IS THIS BILL WE NEED TO CLOSE THE CURRENT LOOPHOLE IN LOSS OF RECEIVING A FIRE ARM WITH THE VALUE OF NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OR LESS CAN BE CHARGED AS A WOBBLER- SO WE DO ASK THE COMMITTEE- TO.

RECEIVING STOLEN FIREARM VALUE LESS NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS EXCEPT IN VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES CAN ONLY BE CHARGED AS A MISDEMEANOR WHICH IS NOT REFLECT THE DANGEROUSNESS OF THE CRIME. STONE FIREARMS ARE FOR OFTEN FOUND IN UNDERGROUND GUN MARKETS WERE THERE ILLEGALLY SOLD TRADED. IN USED TO FACILITATE VIOLENT CRIMES POSING SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE COMMUNITY SAFETY. OUR COMMUNITIES ARE EXPERIENCING INCREASED VIOLENT CRIME MANY OF WHICH INVOLVE FIREARMS WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THIS COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA SOME OF THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE COUNTRY HOWEVER MANY OF THEM INCLUDING THE ILLEGAL PURCHASE OF STOLEN FIREARMS BECAUSE IN MANY INSTANCES THEY KNOW THEY'LL FACE. VERY FEW CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR ILLEGAL ACTS FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY FIVE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE IN THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

BUT ISRAELI PERRY ON THE HAPLESS FOR ACTIVE SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR. I HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU. IT WILL NOW MOVE TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- I THINK I NEED ANOTHER CHAIR AT THE THANK YOU READ EVERY. THANK YOU RYAN. OKAY. WITH EVERY RATED BEGIN FIVE MINUTES. MY NAME IS MARCO GEORGIAN I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AGAIN IN OPPOSITION TO TWENTY FIVE FORTY FIVE- HI AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY FIVE IS NOT NEEDED AS THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR OF THIS BILL NOPE STOLEN GUNS WHEN YOU STARVE WHEN USED OR FOR CRIMES IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL WILL FACE MUCH MORE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES WHICH RANGE FROM AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. TWO TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE IN STATE PRISON- MUCH MORE THAN THE WOBBLER THIS BILL PROPOSES. THIS BILL WILL NOT SEND THE MESSAGE TO CRIMINALS. WHAT TWENTY FIVE FORTY FIVE WILL DO. IS END UP WITH MORE BLACK AND BROWN CALIFORNIANS SENT TO JAIL OR PRISON BECAUSE PROSECUTORSWILL ELECT TO CHOOSE THEM WITH FELONIES. IMPOVERISH THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES PERMANENTLY LIMIT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SUFFERED FELONY CONVICTIONS TO LOW PAYING JOBS BECAUSE MANY EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND BETTER PAYING JOBS AREN'T OPEN TO FELONS. WASTE TAXPAYER RESOURCES IMPRISONING PEOPLE WALK CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HEALTH CARE AND HOUSING. WANT TO GO WAIT WANTING FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING. SO WHAT WE URGE YOU INSTEAD TO DO IS ADOPT A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO GUNS AND GUN VIOLENCE. IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IT WOULD BE MORE HUMANE AND IT WOULD COST LESS. WE HAVE ALREADY TRIED TOUGH ON CRIME IT FAILS. CALIFORNIA HAS REDUCED SMOKING BY IMPOSING TAXES ON CIGARETTES FANS ON SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES AND EDUCATION SIMILARLY. DEATHS FROM MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS ARE DOWN BY 90% AND THAT ALSO- WAS THE RESULT OF A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH. SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON A B. TWENTY FIVE FORTY FIVE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAMBERS FRED WILLIAMS OF ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION AC CALIFORNIA ACTION IS A COLLABORATION OF ACLU SOCAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SAN DIEGO WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWO FIVE FOUR FIVE. THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE THE PENALTY FOR ANYONE WHO BUYS ARAMBULA GET TO BE STOLEN FROM A MISDEMEANOR TO ALLOW THEIR OFFENSE WE UNDERSTAND OTHERS INTENT TO CURB THE STOLEN THE STOLEN FIREARM SECONDARY MARKET. AS WELL AS PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE ISN'T ON THE FIRE HOWEVER IMPRISONING MORE CALIFORNIANS WITH LONGER SENTENCES IS NOT THE SOLUTION. CURRENTLY POSSESSION OF A STOLEN FIREARM IS ALREADY COMMON IS THIS THING LAW IN THIS TOPIC IS OFFICIALLY ADDRESSED IN THE PENAL CODE. AND MY COLLEAGUES THAT THEIR MERE A MYRIAD OF PENALTIES AND ENHANCEMENTS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO COMMITS AN OFFENCE WHILE ARMED WITH A STOLEN FIREARM USING A FIREARM. DURING THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE INDEED THAT IS CORRECT FROM YEAR TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE DEPENDING ON THE SENATE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENSE WHEN WE CHANGE MISDEMEANORS ALLOW THE PENALTIES WILL WE DO IS WE- AUGMENT THE CURRENT DISPARITIES THAT ARE ALREADY PRESENT. WITHIN OUR SENTENCING MOST ON BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS MALL EVEN MORE OFTENTIMES BLACK MAN AND BROWN MAN INDIVIDUALS END UP BEING TARRED WITH THE WOBBLER IS TO THE MISDEMEANOR AS A WHITE- AS- Y. INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMIT THE SAME CRIMES. AND SO WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THE BASIC BILL PLAN AT OF THOSE BRUCE HE SAID HE OF THESE BILLS CREATE A NEW CRIME. USUALLY FINDING A NOVEL WAY TO CHARACTERIZE AND CRIMINALIZE CONDUCT THAT IS ALREADY PROSCRIBED. IS MULTIPLICATION IN PARTICULAR THEY XIN OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR CREATES INCREASING COMPLEXITY WITHOUT COMMENSURATE BENEFITS. AND IT'S FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON TWO FIVE FOUR. FIVE YOU. ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN ROW. OR OUTSIDE THE ROOM THEY WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR COULD YOU OPEN UP FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FIVE POINT FIVE MURATSUCHI. YOU CAN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO. PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND I HAVE NO ONE IN THE PHONE QUEUE THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS MR QUIRK. SO MISTER MURATSUCHI- YOU AND I ARE TOGETHER A LOT OF THINGS WERE NOT TOGETHER HERE BUT JUST TO GIVE ONE EXAMPLE. THAT GUN THAT WAS FOUND STOLEN GUN. UP FIRST FOES COULD CONVERTED TO BE A MACHINE GUN. WHICH IS HIGHLY ILLEGAL I THOUGHT IF IT WAS USED IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME IT'S FELONY WHICH MAY WELL HAVE I'M NOT GOING TO PREJUDGE IT BUT IT MAY WELL HAVE. CARRIED IT IN PUBLIC IS A FELONY AND HE WAS A FELON SO HAVING THE GUN WAS A FELONY THAT'S ENOUGH. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IT WOULD ALLOW. AN ARBITRARY SEARCH. WELL SHE IS ME IT WOULD ALLOW US LAW ENFORCEMENT ATTACKED TO TARGET GROUPS FIRST SEARCH AND THEN FINDING THE GUN- ALLOWANCE TO ALLOW THE DA TO SAY. LEAVE A MISDEMEANOR FOR X. Y. OR C. OR WE WILL CHARGE YOU WITH FELONY AND I JUST DON'T AGREE WITH THAT BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO CREATED DISAGREE THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MATT RESPOND HERE THANK YOU UGH MR QUIRK I AGREE WHERE WE ARE- FRIENDS AND- WE AGREE MORE THAN WE DISAGREE- I WOULD JUST SAY THE AND THAT AS A FORMER- LOS ANGELES COUNTY PROSECUTOR AS WELL AS A LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER- THAT NUMBER ONE THE ARGUMENTS THAT THERE ARE OTHER CRIMES. THAT CAN BE- CHARGED TO PUNISH SOMEONE WHO KNOWINGLY RECEIVES OR BUYS A STOLEN FIREARM THAT'S IF THERE IS ANOTHER UNDERLYING CRIME. BUT HERE I MEAN. IF WE ARE TO AGREE AS THE COMEDIAN ALSO POINTS OUT THAT ALL GUN CRIMES SHOULD BE TREATED AS SERIOUS THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS NO UNDERLYING CRIME WHEN THEY WOULD KNOWINGLY BUY OR RECEIVE A STOLEN FIREARM. AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S I MEAN I AGREE THAT. YOU KNOW I I'M A JOINT AUTHORS ACTUALLY OF A BILL THAT THAT MR GIPSON A PRESENTED EARLIER ON THE ON THE- BANNING MOST GUNS I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S ANOTHER PROSE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE I MAY DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE SUPPORTERS ALL. OF THIS BILL ON THAT POINT BUT- YOU KNOW I DO BELIEVE THAT IT COMES DOWN TO YOU KNOW IF WE ARE TO HAVE A STRONG ENFORCEMENT OF GUN LAWS THERE NEED TO BE CONSEQUENCES SO. YOU KNOW WE SAW THERE WAS A RECENT LOS ANGELES TIMES ARTICLE- STATING YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT- THE NUMBER OF MISDEMEANOR CRIMINAL CHARGES FILED BY THE CURRENT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS HALF OF WHAT WAS FILED UNDER THE PREVIOUS DISTRICT ATTORNEY. YOU KNOW I IF IT TALK ABOUT. ABOUT YOU KNOW THE CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT APPROACH FAILING YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT- CRIMINAL STATISTICS ARE ARE MORE COMPLICATED- IT'S HARD TO DETERMINE CAUSE AND EFFECT. YOU KNOW JUST LIK IT'S HARD TO SAY. THE RECENT INCREASE IN VIOLENT. CRIMES IS A REFLECTION OF THE FAILURE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM I MEAN. THE BALANCE YOU KNOW WE NEED TO HAVE A BALANCED APPROACH WHERE. AS I SUPPORT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE. BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KNOWINGLY RECEIVING STOLEN FIREARM. STANDING IN AND OF ITSELF. THE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THAT THE OPTION. OF FILING AND YOU EITHER AS A MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY. WELL WE JUST AGREE TO DISAGREE. AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE I DO THINK AS ONE OF THE- OPPOSITION PEOPLE SAID IT'S- YOU KNOW. IF YOU'RE WITH THE SON OF A- WHITE RICH PERSON YOU'RE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO. BE OUR- SEARCH MUCH LESS LIKELY TO BE CHARGED ETCETERA ETCETERA- I THINK OUR OUR LAWS YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO DISAGREE SORRY THANKS. ANYMORE COMMITTEE FOR. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I AM A- LOOKING TO SEE A YOU KNOW WHERE THE REPUBLICANS WIN. AYE AYE AYE WHICH TO SAY THAT- YOU KNOW I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO. WE NEED TO DO MORE OBVIOUSLY I THINK WE WANT ONE THING THAT WE SHOULD BE OF THE GREEN THAT AGREE ON IS THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO FILE IT FILE A FIGHT VIOLENT. YOU KNOW I IT'S NAY NEEDLESS TO SAY ON MY PART THAT- THAT THAT THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT ARE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT BLACK AND BROWN VICTIMS- AND SO RATIONAL. PROPOSAL TO TRY TO RESTORE SOME OF THE BALANCE IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING- DRAMATICS AND VIOLENT CRIMES IN OUR STATE MOVE THE BILL- BUT IT. I WILL NOT VOTE FOR THE BILL BUT I WILL RESPECT AND HOPEFULLY- WEEK ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL WILL SECOND IT SALUTE AT LEAST VOTE- VOTED UP OR DOWN- I AM NOT. I AM NOT A- FORMER PROSECUTOR NORM A FORMER DA. BUT PRESENTLY I'M AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE. WHO KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE. WHEN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BY D. A.'S LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKS AGAINST YOU ADD THE PYLON AT DECISIONAL. PROBLEMATIC LAWS THAT WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS IT IS A PROBLEM AND WE WENT TO THIS LIKE THIRTY YEARS OF IT OF YOU KNOW LET'S GET ON CRIME LET'S AND USE THAT MEANT LET'S GET. OFF ON PEOPLE OF COLOR. LET'S LOCK UP AS MANY PEOPLE OF COLOR BECAUSE WE ARE SO AFRAID OF THEM WERE SCARED OF THEM WE NEED TO DO MORE TO MORE TO LOCK THEM UP. TO MAKE US. WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE US I FEEL COMFORTABLE AND SAFE AND BETTER- AND THAT'S WHY WE PROBABLY HAVE A PLETHORA OF. PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I KNOW YOU GENERALLY BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU BELIEVE THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A GO AHEAD AND GIVE ME THE COURTESY VOTE AGAIN I HOPE YOU YOU YOU GET THAT BOAT BUT GET. IT TO BE VOTED ON TO BE HEARD BEING HURT- BUT BUT I HOPE THAT WE CAN EVENTUALLY COME UP WITH- A WAY THAT WE CAN BOTH HELP. PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF WHAT CRIME AND WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T BECAUSE IT'S JUST THE EASIEST-THING TO DO. AND SO- I THINK YOU'RE GENUINE AND THAT I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT WE UNITE. TO HAVE HAD OUR- DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS- BUT I WOULD DO BELIEVE YOU GENERALLY HAVE A HEART IN THIS AND YOU GENERALLY. BELIEVE IN IN PARTS OF REHABILITATION CAN YOU BELIEVE IN. THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE HAVE NOT DONE WELL WHICH I WILL AGREE WITH YOU. AND ONCE WE GET OUR MUCH WE ABLE TO DO THAT PROVIDE HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH- EDUCATION ONCE WE GET THAT ON TRACK I THINK THE PUBLIC WILL. SEE THE BENEFITS OF IT LONG RANGE IT'S JUST THAT IT TAKES TIME. LOCKING SOMEONE UP AND THROWING AWAY THE KEY IS OUT. IMMEDIATE AND YOU FEEL BETER YOU WALK AWAY WHAT DOES IT DO TO OUR COMMUNITY IT IS DOESN'T HELP BY SEVEN RUMORED TO G. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NILE LACKEY BONTA BRIAN. BRIAN NOT VOTING QUIRKNO WORK NOW SANTIAGO. SEYARTO THE MEASURE FAILS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE. ONE ON OUR SIDE. MY BACK UP AGAIN. I THINK I'LL BACK UP AGAIN. WE HAVE DO WE HAVE ON OFFER IN THE HOUSE. MISTER TERRIFIC- WELL JONES SAWYER OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ARE PESENT AB OF FORTY TWENTY FORTY THREE RISK A LINE CALIFORNIA WITH EIGHTEEN OTHER STATES WITH REQUIRING BAIL FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENTS COLLATERAL YOU KNOWN AS BOUND A KNOWN AS BY HIS TO BECOME LICENSED BY THE STATE. CURRENT LAW ON BAIL FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENTS IS LIMITED TO EDUCATION NOTICE AND CONDUCT STANDARD WHICH IS UNVERIFIABLE CONSIDERING THERE IS A LACK OF IN HOUSE SUPERVISION FROM INDUSTRY WHEN HIRING AND MANAGING RECOVERY AGENTS FURTHER POINT TO BAIL FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENT IS TERMINATED PRO FOR VIOLATING CALIFORNIA LAW THERE IS NO WAY TO TRACK SUCH TERMINATION AT DUSTY'S INDIVIDUALS CAN BE HIRED BY A SEPARATE COMPANY. THE CURRENT ISSUE WE FACE IS NO ENTITY IS CHARGED WITH ENFORCEMENT OF THESE RECOVERY AGENTS AND AS SUCH THEY ARE ALL IN PORTSMOUTH CAREERS AFTER THE FACT BECAUSE THE RECOVERY AGENTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BAIL BOND TRANSACTIONS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE CDI HAS BECOME THEIR DE FACTO WATCHDOG. DESPITE THE FACT THESE AGENTS ARE NOT LICENSE I DO NOT PAY ANY FEES TO CDI. BELL FUGITIVE RECOVERY TO FOR INCENTIVE TO MAKE ARRESTS OFTEN WITHOUT WARRANTS COMBINED WITH THE ABILITY TO SELF REGULATE FAILS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM A JOB. THAT SIMULATES LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SUBJECTS THE PUBLIC TOO DANGEROUS AND DRAMATIC SITUATION. FOR EXAMPLE IN APRIL. TWENTY TWENTY ONE A PALM SPRINGS RESIDENT WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY A BILL FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENT DESPITE NOTING THAT NO WARRANTS HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR THE RESIDENTS ARREST. AND THE RESIDENT HAD NOT FAILED TO APPEAR IN COURT TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE RECOVERY AGENT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DOING RECOVERY WORK NOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM IN THE FIRST PLACE DUE TO HIS. PRIOR FELONY CONVICTIONS THIS TRAGIC KILLING COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED HAD THERE BEEN MORE ASIAN AND PRE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING FOR THOSE WHO HIRED THIS RECOVERY AGENT AS WELL AS HAD BEEN THERE AND IT HAD BEEN AN ENTITY TO VERIFY WHO ALL IS OPERATE IN OUR STATE. OTHER TROUBLING SITUATIONS HAVE INCLUDED SHOOTING OF A MILITARY VETERAN WITH PTSD AFTER COVERING AGENTS BROKE INTO THE VETERANS RESIDENTS. THROUGH HIS WINDOW. GIVE ME. S. AND SEPARATELY. RECOVERY AGENTS BREAKING INTO AN INNOCENT FAMILIES HOME WHO HAD NO RETALIATION TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO COVER AGENTS WERE TARGETING. MEMBERS FOR. AN OCCUPATION THAT IS GIVEN GREATER AUTHORITY THAN LAW ENFORCEMENT BY NOT REQUIRING A WARRANT TO ARREST AND ENTER SOMEONE'S HOME ENHANCE STANDARDS ARE CRITICAL. BY REQUIRING BAIL FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENTS BECOMES LICENSE AB TWENTY FORTY THREE WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE LONG OVERDUE OVERSIGHT OF ITS ACTIVATION BUBBLE ALSO PROVIDE. GREATER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR HARM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ADDITIONALLY AB TWENTY FORTY THREE WAS SYSTEM LOCAL AW ENFORCEMENT IDENTIFYING WHO IS OPERATING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND PROVIDE THEM WITH GREATER INSIGHT WERE RESPONDING TO CALLS AS WELL AS PROVIDE AN EXTRA TOOL FOR PROSECUTORS TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO BREAK CALIFORNIA LAW WITH ME VIA THE TELECONFERENCE LAW TO SPEAK OF. THOSE MONSTER IS KENDRA ZOELLER DEPUTY LEAD DIRECTOR OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. GOOD AFTERNOON HUNDRED DOLLAR HERE ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. AS THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THE MEASURE. AB FOUR THREE WOULD CREATE THE FIRST FAILED. RECOVERY AGENT LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA THERE BY BRINGING LONG OVERDUE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT THAT THEY'LL FIND INDUSTRY AND ALIGN OUR STATE WITH EIGHTEEN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE EXISTING MANDATORY. LICENSURE IN PLACE BOUNTY HUNTER DAY BECAUSE OF INSURANCE REGULATE FAIL BONTA ON BAIL AGENT. WE OFTEN RECEIVE COMPLAINTS INVOLVING BALE FUGITIVE RECOVERY PERSONS HOWEVER SINCE WE ARE NOT THEIR REGULATOR THERE IS LITTLE WE CAN DO. A FEW RECENT AND TRAGIC INCIDENT INVOLVING BOUNTY HUNTERS TRYING TO ACKERMAN. AND THOSE WHO JUMPED BAIL HAVE THE NEED FOR MORE DEPARTMENT OVERSIGHT AND FOUNDING. TO THE PARK FIVE. WE HAVE NOT FOR YEARS THAT ALLOWING THE INDUSTRY TO SELF REGULATE IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THE STATUS QUO HAS NEVER BEEN ENOUGH. REQUIRING FUGITIVES RECOVERY PERSONS TO FIRST OBTAIN A LICENSE PRIOR TO CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN THE STATE WOULD HELP CURTAIL RECKLESS PURSUITS APPREHENSION OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IN ADDITION BAILED OF RECOVERY AGENTS WOULD HAVE TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECKS DONE BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION PRIOR TO LICENSURE AND THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CAROLINE KERRY LIABILITY INSURANCE WHICH WOULD PROVIDE HARM CONSUMERS AND CENTRAL AVENUE TO COLLECT DAMAGES. AB EIGHT ZERO FOUR THREE IS NEEDED NOW TO RAISE THE STANDARD FOR BAIL FUGITIVE RECOVERY PERSON TO APPREHEND BAIL YOU DID IT AS WELL AS SHINING. LIGHT ON THE INDUSTRY IT WILL ALSO STRENGTHENED THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND PREVENT FUTURE VIOLATIONS OF LAW THAT READY PUBLIC. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE THOSE.

THE BACK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WOMEN STAFF TO GET TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS A GOOD PRODUCT IF YOU LOOK AT MOST THE AMENDMENTS THOSE FOR ALL PRODUCTS CONVERSATIONS WE HAD WITH THE DEPARTMENT. FLAG ON THIS BILL IS THAT- THE AGENCY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A BAIL AGENT BAIL RECOVERY AGENTS CREATED BY A CONTRACT IT VERY SELDOM INVOLVES AN INSURANCE COMPANY WHICH I REPRESENT. SO THE AMEND WE WOULD ASK FOR IS THAT THE PERSON THAT APPOINTS THE BILL RECOVERY AGENT FILES THE POINT WITH THE DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE. IN I SAID THE AGENCY RELATIONSHIPIS CREATED BY THE CONTRACT. BAIL AGENT HIRED THE BILL RECOVERY AGENT AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE WOULD ASK ON THIS BILL IS TO MAKE CLEAR TO THE PUBLIC AND THE DEPARTMENT WHO'S ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT WHEN THE HIGHER THE BILL RECOVERY AGENT. OTHER THAN THAT I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL I THINK IT'S AS THE SOMEONE IN SAID CONSISTENT WITH. A LEGISLATION EIGHTEEN OTHER STATES MOST OF WHICH I'VE WORKED ON- AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS BILL FAIRLY CONSISTENT- WITH THE PRACTICE AND OTHER STATES HAVE CHOSEN TO REGULATE FORTUNE MY HOME STATE OF COLORADO HAS NOT SO GIVE HIM A RING AND LET THEM KNOW- THAT IT'S TIME BUT AGAIN LIKE THINKING.

COMMITTEE COMMITTEE- THAT WILL ALSO SHED SOME LIGHT ON HIS PERFECT PERSPECTIVE AND A LOT OF TIMES OF MY SIDE OF THE AISLE DUTTON IN LIST. SOME OR- FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE SO I WOULD I WOULD BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR US TO CONTINUE THIS PROCESS.

WHO NEEDS TO BE REPORTED TO BUT INSURANCE COMPANY OR THE BOND AGENCY BECAUSE THESE CONTRACTS COULD BE- WE JUST NEED TO LOOK AT THE RIGHT. LET'S SEE THAT EVERYTHING BEING DONE THAT AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL LAUREL AND AB ON AB TWENTY FORTY THREE BASS JOHNSON- THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI GENSER IRAQI STATE LACKEY ABSTAINED BONTA I'VE BONTA HI BRIAN. WORK HI WORK I SANTIAGO. SEYARTO THE R. TEN NOT VOTING THAT MEASURE. NEEDS TO WORK THANK YOU. MISS PETRI NORRIS WHY DON'T YOU COME FORWARD. YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THAT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BELT TWENTY TWO SIX. AB TWO TWO FOUR SIX AIMS TO PREVENT FEDERAL POISONING BY STRENGTHENING PENALTIES FOR THE TRAFFICKING OF THIS DEADLY DRUG WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS FOR ATTEMPTS TO SELL TO CHILDREN AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE JOURNAL IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS AND DEADLY SUBSTANCES IN THE WORLD JUST TWO MILLIGRAMS TO MILLIGRAMS OF FUNCTIONAL IS TWO GRAINS OF SAND IS ENOUGH TO KILL. AND KILL EIGHT IT CERTAINLY HAS ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA'S DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY STATEWIDE FEDERAL DEBTS INCREASED BY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE. I LIKE FENTANYL NOW ACCOUNT FOR ONE AS HER TWO THIRDS OF NATIONWIDE DRUG RELATED DEATHS BUT TWO DISTURBING TRENDS REALLY HAVE DRAMATICALLY ESCALATED THE DANGERS OF FUNCTIONAL AT FIRST THE DECEPTIVE USE OF FENTANYL IN COUNTERFEIT PILLS. AND SECOND THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA TRAFFIC THESE SUBSTANCES AND THIS POISON OUR CHILDREN INTO YOUNG PEOPLE. FEDERAL IS EASY AND CHEAP TO MANUFACTURE AND IT'S OFF MAST AND MARKETED IN THE FORM OF COUNTERFEIT PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE THERE BEEN THOUSAND OF REPORTS INDIVIDUALS WHO DIE OF A FENCE IS. AFTER CONSUMING A THAT THEY WERE MISLED TO BELIEVE WAS SOMETHING ELSE ALTOGETHER. I IN FACT THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION THE D. E. A. RECENTLY RELEASED A WARNING ON THE SHARP INCREASE IN FAKE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CONTAINING FENTANYL. I THIS DRUG PRODUCED A CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IT'S INCUMBENT THAT WE ACT NOW TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. AND ESPECIALLY OUR KIDS FROM THIS PRESENT. THESE ARE TO BE JOINED TODAY BY TWO WITNESSES WHO WILL SHARE THEIR STORIES AND THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH FUNCTIONAL. WE'RE JOINED BY AND AMY NOVEL AND CHRISTY. HI MY NAME'S AMY LEVEL. AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MY SON ALEXANDER NOBLE. HE ALEX WITH ADOBE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD FROM THE SUBURBS OF THE SKATEBOARD AND A BRIGHT FUTURE. HE DID MAKE THE DECISION NOT TO MAKE TO PURCHASE A PILL VIA SNAPCHAT AND HAD IT DELIVERED TO OUR HOME JUST LIKE EASY AS ORDERING A PIZZA. ALEXANDER DIED SOMETIME IN THE NIGHT IN HIS BEDROOM. FROM WHAT I SAW ON SNAPCHAT AND ALEXANDER AND WHAT I HEARD FROM ALEXANDER'S FRIEND FRIENDS THIS DEALER OPENLY DENIED ON SNAPCHAT WHAT WAS PLAIN HIS PILLS CONTAINED FENTANYL AND KILLED MY SON. THIS IS THE SAME DEALER IS NOW CONNECTED TO SEVERAL MORE DEATHS BEFORE ALEXANDER'S DEATH AND AFTER. I'M NOT A VINDICTIVE PERSON BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT MONSTERS LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ROAM FREELY ROAM OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND ONLINE. WE SHOULD MAKE EFFORTS TO INCARCERATE THOSE WHO KNOWINGLY PEDDLE POISON AND DEADLY AMOUNTS. I ASSURE YOU THAT FENCE ALL IS A POISON. WITH COCAINE AND HEROIN ONE HAS TO CONSUME DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNTS TO OVERDOSE. TODAY FENCE NOT REQUIRED NO MORE THAN A PENSION TO KILL FOUR POPLE. THIS DRUG KILLS AND WE NEED TO ACT LIKE IT. FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS VINCE ALWAYS BEEN GROWING AND MULTIPLYING IN OUR DRUG STREAM LIKE A VIRUS. IT IS NOW IN THE MAJORITY OF ILLICIT DRUGS YET WE CONTINUE TO BEHAVE THAT THE DRUG CLIMATE IS THE SAME AS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN. IT'S NOT TODAY TODAY'S ILLICIT DRUG MARKET RACKS UP OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICAN DRUG DEATHS A YEAR DRIVEN LARGELY BY SENTINEL. THAT NUMBER IS STILL GOING UP BECAUSE COMMITTEES LIKE THIS STOP HELPING DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S SCHOOLS AND CLINICIANS WITH OUR DRUG PROBLEM. LIKE IT OR NOT AMERICANS WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIMENT AND CONSUME. DRUGS TO GET HIGHER TO TREAT PAIN OR WHATEVER REASON THEY HAVE. WE NEED TO HELP PEOPLE BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THEY USE THEM. FOR DECADES WE WITNESSED THE WAR THE OLD DRUG OR FAILURES WE SAW PRISONS OVERFLOW FOCUSED UPON MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND ARE NOW SELF PARALYZED DUE TO OVER CORRECTION. THIS SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF EVERYONE'S MIND HERE WHEN CONSIDERING ENHANCING PENALTIES. WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE EXAMPLES IN PORTUGAL IN EUROPE OR PENALTIES WERE RE EVALUATED ACROSS THE BOARD. PUBLIC HEALTH IS PRIORITIZE AND DRUG EDUCATION IS REQUIRED AS PART OF HARM REDUCTION. FOR THESE REASONS I SAW THIS BILL AS A FIRST STEP. THE TERMS OF THIS BILL WAY OUT REASONABLE PENALTIES FOR FENTANYL DISTRIBUTION. THIS BILL-FOCUSES UPON SPECIFIC METHODS OF SALE THIS BILL IS FOCUSED UPON A DRUG THAT LITERALLY KILLS PEOPLE FORTY SIX TO GO TO THE FLOOR FOR DEBATE. YOU ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WITH INTERNAL NOW IT'S TIME TO LET THE PUBLIC HAVE A SAY BY LETTING THEIR REPRESENTATIVES DISCUSSED IT AND DECIDE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MIKE WAS. WHENEVER YOU A TO DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS IN TWENTY TWENTY I FOUND MY SEVEN YEAR OLD SON ZACH APPEARING TO BE ASLEEP ONLY TO FIND HIM NOT BREATHING LOSING A CHILD FROM A DANGER WE HAD NOT HEARD OF BEFORE HAS BROUGHT DEBILITATING TORMENT TO OUR FAMILY. SACRAMENTO THE COUNTERFEIT PRESCRIPTION PILLS AND CHAD TO CONTAIN ONLY FUNCTIONAL HI DESPITE HAVING NO HISTORY OF DRUG USE. ZACH DIED FROM FENTANYL POISONING. ZACH WAS A SELF TAUGHT MUSICIAN BONAFIDE STRAIGHT A STUDENT ACCOMPLISH MULTI SPORT ATHLETE LEAD ROLE IN A HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL AND ACTIVE IN SCOUTING. SINCE HIS PASSING ZACH WAS ACCEPTED INTO FIVE UC'S INCLUDING UCLA. LIKE SO MANY ZACH HAS DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS AND SHOWED PROMISE TO BRING INNOVATION AND PROGRESS TO OUR WORLD IN A BEAUTIFUL WAY. INSTEAD HE WAS ROBBED OF THAT CHANCE CDC HAS REPORTED OVER ONE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND LIVES LOST IN OUR NATION FROM DRUGS IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. AND ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND ATTRIBUTED TO SYNTHETICS MOSTLY FENSOM. THAT'S A FINAL DEATH RATE ABOUT ONE EVERY SEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE U. S. BECAUSE- ORDER PROTECTION. AGENCY REPORTED OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS OF FENTANYL THAT WERE CONFISCATED AND YET ESTIMATE ONLY ONLY 5% ARE ACTUALLY BEING SEIZED THE RADICALLY THAT'S TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS OF FENTANYL. THAT ARE STILL ON OUR STREETS TODAY FROM ONLY ONE YEAR OF TRUCK TRAFFICKING. YET DEALERS ARE KNOWINGLY AND WILLINGLY WILLINGLY SELLING ILLICIT PRODUCTS CONTAINING FENTANYL TO UNSUSPECTING YOUNG ADULTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR AN EASY PROFIT. CALIFORNIA IS A HOT SPOT STATE ALONG THE BORDER AND THIS EVIDENCE SHOWS THERE IS A CLEAR PUBLIC SAFETY DANGER AND IT IS ONLY WORSENING. IN THIS BILL TO THE FLOOR WOULD SHOW A LACK OF PRIORITY TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY. THE NATURE OF THIS CRISIS SHOULD ALLOW THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY THE RIGHT AND THE RESPONSIBILITY. TO STUDY AND IMPLEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO STOP TRAFFICKERS FROM VICTIMIZING THE PUBLIC WHO ARE UNWITTINGLY INGESTING FENTANYL AND DINE. THINK ABOUT IT I FELT NO RELATED DEATH EVERY SEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES PLEASE SUPPORT AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SIX STANNIS HOLIDAY ALREADY WITH US WITH OUR FAMILY AND SO MANY OTHER FAMILIES IN OUR NATION AND HELP SAVE OUR NATION'S FUTURE THANK.

THANK YOU FOR NOW HEAR FROM WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO- AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SIX. A FAMILY YOU COULD ALLOW THEM TO HAVE AT THE SEE THANK. THE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I WANT TO START BY- OFFERING MY CONDOLENCES TO ALL THE FAMILY MEMBERS- OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE OVERDOSED FROM SENTINEL MY NAME IS JENNA HEY WHAT I'M THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION AT THE NATIONAL HARM REDUCTION COALITION WE ARE A CAPACITY BUILDING AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WHO BUILDS BASED STRATEGIES WITH AND FOR PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS OUR APPROACH IS ROOTED IN THE FACT THAT MOST DRUG RELATED HARMS ARE CAUSED BY FAILED POLICY AND NOT ACTUAL DRUG AND- I AM ALL HERE. AS A FORMER INJECTS DRUG USE WHO IS NOW IN RECOVERY RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB ME TO FORTY. I DID JOB IS AND BUILDING HARVARD PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA I WORK% WITH DOZENS OF DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PARTICIPANTS OF HARM REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND ALL OF US WANT TO AND OVERDOSE DEATH AB TWENTY FORTY SIX IS NOT CERTAIN OVER. AS I SAY DOWN AT MY COMPUTER YES TO REPAIR MY STATEMENT I OPENED IN A FROM A MOTHER IN. SHE WANTED TO THANK US FOR OUR WORK AND TELL US ABOUT HOW SHE HAD RECENTLY LOST HER HER SECOND SON TO OVERDOSE HER AND HER SON ALLEN HAD OVERDOSED IN THE BACK OF A POLICE CAR UNDER CUSTODY ON MARCH TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND WAS DEAD FOR OVER AN HOUR BEFORE OFFICERS OPENED THE DOOR TO CHECK ON HIM. THIS IS ONE OF HUNDREDS OF INSTANCES WHERE POLICE INTERVENTION THAT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE SAFETY. HAS INSTEAD ONLY CAUSE MORE HARM. THE OVERDOSE CRISIS WILL NOT BE SOLVED BY ENHANCED SENTENCING FOR LOW LEVEL DRUG SELLERS MANY OF WHOM ARE USING THEMSELVES. THE REALITY IS THAT NOW IS PART OF THE DRUG SUPPLY NOW AND FOCUSING ON CRIMINALIZING PEOPLE WHO SELL DRUGS ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT GOING TO STOP DRUG USE OR DRUG SALES. AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO FIX THE DRUG SUPPLY. PROHIBITION AND CRIMINALIZATION HAVE LONG BEEN TACTICS IN THE WAR ON DRUGS AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT BAIL OVER OVER AGAIN. WHEN OVER NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO OVERDOSE DEATHS BETWEEN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY AND JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN CALIFORNIA. THE LEGISLATURE URGENTLY NEEDS TO ACT WHAT WE SEE ON THE GROUND IS THAT HARM REDUCTION WORKS AND I DON'T JUST MEAN IN TERMS OF DISEASE PREVENTION. THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF HARM REDUCTION CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR PREVENTION TREATMENT AND RECOVERY EFFORTS. TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE ON THE DRUG USE CONTINUE- AND KEEP PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS ALIVE. WHETHER THEY'RE HABITUAL USERS ARE YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIMENTING WITH DRUGS FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO DRUG EDUCATION THAT IS EVIDENCE BASED AND DOESN'T ONLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO AVOID DRUGS. IT MUST ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HOW THEY CAN REDUCE RISK. THEY NEED SOMEONE THEY CAN BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON FOR THEM WHO CAN PROVIDE STIGMA FREE SUPPORT. I HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN AND BELIEVE ME I DO NOT HOPE FOR THEM TO END UP. DRUG DEPENDENT THE WAY I WAS. I NOW UNDERSTAND THE GUT WRENCHING WORRYMY MOM HAD. FEARING THAT OUR CHILD MIGHT DIE IN VIEW FEELING POWERLESS. SHE ABSOLUTELY WOULD HAVE WANTED THE FRIENDS THAT I USE WITH LOCKED UP IF THAT MEANT IT WOULD HAVE. MY TRUTH WHAT IT WAS GOOD AND WHERE TO GET HIRED A MATTER. I WOULD TO SEVEN CORE OR DRUG PER THAT EIGHTY AND TWENTY YEARS OLD AND THAT ONE OF THEM STOPPED ME FROM USING I AM LUCKY TO STAND HERE TODAY AND TELL MY STORY OR SIT HERE TODAY AND TELL MY STORY AND- A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE DIFFERENCES IN DRUG SUPPLY- TWENTY YEARS AGO. BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE NALOXONE I MOSTLY USE ALONE AND I HAD NO ONE TO TALK HONESTLY WITH ABOUT MY USE. WELL MANDATED TREATMENT RARELY WORKS WE KNOW FROM BEING ON THE GROUND WITH DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS THAT TREATMENT IS STILL NOT READILY AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE. WHO DO WANT IT AS PART OF MY WORK IN CALIFORNIA WE PROVIDED GRANT FUNDING TO THIRTY SEVEN HARM REDUCTION PROGRAMS TO EXPAND STAFFING FOR NAVIGATION TO TREATMENT. WE ADVOCATED FOR THIS FUNDING ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAM COALITION. AFTER HEARING FROM PROGRAM FOR. THAT THEY COULD NOT ACCESS TREATMENT WHEN THEY WANTED IT. TODAY TWO YEARS AND REFERRALS AND LINKAGES TO TREATMENT HAVE TRIPLED. HARM REDUCTION APPROACHES LIKE THIS INITIATIVE COULD BE SCALED UP TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE AT ANY STAGE OF DRUG USE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK TO MAKE NALOXONE ACCESSIBLE WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO A LINE WITH NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION BEST PRACTICES. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT COMMUNITY SATURATION OF NALOXONE REDUCES OVERDOSE DEATH. I WAS VISITING SOME PROGRAMS IN SAN DIEGO LAST WEEKEND PARTICIPANTS THERE REPORTED HAVING TO USE MULTIPLE DOSES OF NALOXONE TO REVERSE AN OVERDOSE. DUE TO THE POTENCY OF THE LOCAL DRUG SUPPLY. THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE ABLE TO GET THE SUPPLIES THEY NEEDED TO KEEP THEMSELVES AND THEIR COMMUNITY SAFE. BUT THIS IS NOT. IN EVERY COUNTY AND EVEN IN COUNTY STROP OVERDOSE PREVENTION AND EDUCATION PROGRMS. THERE ARE STILL MAJOR GAPS IN AVAILABILITY. SOME THIS IS ABOUT SUPPLY AND FUNDING BUT SOME OF IT IS ABOUT MISINFORMATION AND STIGMA. THE SAME DAY IN SAN DIEGO I TALKED TO SOME PROVIDERS WHO ARE MISINFORMED ABOUT THE LAWS AROUND THE LOCKS OWN. AND CONCERNED ABOUT PROVIDER LIABILITY AND THEREFORE WE'RE RESTRICTING HOW AND WHEN IT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO CLIENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WE NEED ANTI STICK. EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS FOCUSED ON OVERDOSE PREVENTION AND WE NEED TO SCALE UP NALOXONE ACCESS. AND DISTRIBUTION TO SATURATE EVERY COMMUNITY WITH THIS LIFESAVING MEDICATION. TIME IS A- GOOD. FINISH UP THE LAST TIME I WENT TO DRUG TREATMENT I WENT VOLUNTARILY TO A REHAB PROGRAM IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT PROGRAM BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AND WE BECAUSE- WE COVER EVER SINCE. BUT THE REALITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO I WENT TO TREATMENT WITH WAS THAT THEY WERE NOT READY OR THE ABSTINENCE MODEL DIDN'T WORK FOR THEM. A LOT OF THEM GOT KICKED OUT OF TREATMENT AND WENT OUT INTO A COMMUNITY THAT HAD NO HARM REDUCTION SERVICES THEY SHARED SYRINGES THEY OVERDOSED AND DIED THEY GOT TREATMENT TREATED TERRIBLY BY POLICE AND EMTS WHEN THEY WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET REVIVED. THEY HAD NO ACCESS TO NALOXONE AND NO TO MEET THE WHERE THEYWERE WITH THEIR USE. THE REALITY IS THAT WE DO KNOW STRATEGIES TO CURB OVERDOSE TO OVERDOSE DEATHS AND HARSHER SENTENCING IS NOT ONE OF THEM. IT ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE HARMS PEOPLE NAVIGATING SYSTEMS FACE WITH AN UNREGULATED DRUG SUPPLY INTERNALIZED AN EXTERNAL STIGMA. AND A FRACTURED MEDICAL CARE AND TREATMENT SYSTEM RECOVERY JOURNEYS MAY OCCASIONALLY START IN JAILS AND WITH PLEASE AND OUR INTERACTIONS BUT WE KNOW THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT GRIEF STORIES START THERE THAT PEOPLE DIE IN CUSTODY LIKE THE MOM GREETING HER CHILD IN TENNESSEE TODAY. WE WILL RECORDS DO NOT HELP PEOPLE RECOVER NOT ONLY FROM STORIES BUT FROM DECADES OF FAILED DRUG POLICY. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND NOVO ON AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SIX THANK YOU THANK YOU TERRY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN A ROOM NAME AND ORGANIZATION ONLY.

YEAH HI MARK CAMPANELLA FROM HEALTH CARE LOS ANGELES IN SUPER STRONG OPPOSITION OF TWO TWO FOUR SIX WE'VE GONE DOWN THIS PATH WE'VE ELECTED PEOPLE OF COLOR WAY TOO LONG. THANK YOU AND I HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU BRING NOW BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING DIRECTLY. FIRST OF ALL. LET ME SAY- I'M SO SORRY FOR THE- WITNESSES WHO. ENTERED UNCONSCIONABLE OF LOS AND- SECONDLY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT. IT OFFENSIVE TO HEAR THE SUB POISONING REFERRED TO AS OVERDOSE. I DON'T THINK YOU MEANT TO INSULT BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS AN INSULT BECAUSE IT IS A POISONING THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POISONING AND OVERDOSE. AND I JUST HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING. THE OPPOSING VIEW THAT WANTS TO PROTECT THE SELLER OF THIS POISON. I'M JUST REALLY REALLY HARD TRYING TO MY BEST TO UNDERSTAND IT. BUT I WILL NEVER AGREE WITH IT. AND I CLEARLY AND THANKFULLY YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS. THIS TRAVESTY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND IT'S HAPPENING AT SUCH AN ALARMING RATE. YET WE DO'T HAVE THE APPETITE TO GO AFTER THE SELLER. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING THE OPPOSITION BUT- KNOW THAT I'M CLEARLY IN SUPPORT AND THANKFUL FOR USED TO HELP THE CURRENT WHICH TO COME HERE AND SHARE YOUR TRAGEDY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M JUST HERE TO VISIBLE BILL BEEN MOVED YET. I'M OF THE BILL. SO FOLLOWING A LITTLE BIT UP MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AND AS A- PARAMEDIC IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND HEROIN OVERDOSES WERE VERY POPULAR- AT LEAST THEY HAD A CHANCE- IF THEY TOOK A LITTLE AND THEY'D BE OK- IF WE GOT THERE WITHIN FOUR MINUTES BABY OKAY. APARTMENT WAS BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO ADMINISTER RESPONSIBLY ADMINISTERED ARCANE IT'S- MANAGER. IN A DAY WHEN YOU'RE ON SCENE AND BRING SOMEBODY BACK FROM NOT BREEDING AN ALMOST DEAD IT IS ALMOST LIKE MAGIC. BUT IF YOU'RE AN UNTRAINED PERSON YOU ADMINISTER THAT AND- SOME OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF BRINGING SOMEBODY BACK FROM AN OVERDOSE LIKE THAT ALSO- SO CONSCIOUS TO- BEING POISONED Y BY THIS. THE FOR REACTION IS TO BUY. AND ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA IS WHAT FOLLOWS AND THAT PERSON DIES- THE OTHER THING WITH THE NOR CAN APPROACH IS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE IS IT YET MAY HAVE SOME SPACE IT WITH THEIR BABY SOME. THAT MIGHT BE PART OF THE SOLUTION- THAT YOU KNOW. NOT HERE NOR CAN LIKE I SAID IT HAS TO BE ADMINISTERED BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND OTHERWISE YOU WILL EXACERBATE THE SITUATION IT HAS TO BE ADMINISTERED WITHIN FORTY SIX MINUTES OF THE PERSON STOPS READING. OTHERWISE THEIR BRAIN IS DEAD. AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. THESE POISONINGS. IF I KNOW I KALRA POISONING IF I GAVE SOMEBODY A CYANIDE PILL AND THEY TOOK IT AND WENT OFF AND DIED THAT I POISON THEM. THERE'S NO TO BE TWO WAYS ABOUT IT- SAME THING WITH ANNA FREEZE A LOT OF PEOPLE- YOU KNOW WHEN THEY WANT TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY THEY LIKE FEET AMANDA FREEZE. UNTIL THEY DIE. PLEASING THAT'S NOT OVERDOSE OF ANNA FREEZE. SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT OVERDOSE HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POISONING. OF A LETHAL SUBSTANCE THAT HAS BEEN MANUFACTURED. FOR THIS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF GETTING PEOPLE ADDICTED. TO DRUGS SO THE PEOPLE THAT DEAL DRUGS. CAN MAKE THE MONEY THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE FOR THEIR CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. FOR US NOT TO AT LEAST CONSIDER ESPECIALLY BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN WE HAVE THE BIGGER DISCUSSION OF WHAT'S THE OVERALL PLAN FOR DEALING WITH FENTANYL IN CALIFORNIA WHICH I HOPE WE WILL HAVE. AN IN THE NEAR FUTURE- WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO SEND THE MESSAGE AND ALLOW PEOPLE THAT SELL AND KILLER KIDS AND THAT'S NOT JUST KIDS AND ADULTS. KNOWINGLY GIVING THEM SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO KILL THEM. WE NEED TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. AND INSTEAD WHAT KIND OF SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THAT YOU'RE SELLING THEM. A POISON PILL. THAT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE OF LAST THEIR KIDS THEY'RE GOOD KIDS. THEY MAY HAVE THOUGHT THEY WERE BUYING SOMETHING THEY'LL KEEP HIM AWAKE SO THEY CAN DO THEIR HOMEWORK. SO THEY CAN DO THEY REPORT TO THEY CAN DO THEIR COLLEGE THESIS THEIR ROOM THEY FALL ASLEEP AND NEVER WAKE UP. SO IT IS HARD FOR ME AS WELL- TO JUST TURNED A BLIND EYE TO WHAT THIS IS. AND NOT ALLOW- AT LEAST AS TO START WORKING ON. ONE ASPECT OF IT WHILE WE FIGURE OUT THE REST OF THOSE ASPECTS OF WHAT WILL WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO STOP THESE DEATHS. BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA GET WORSE EXPONENTIAL. THEY'RE GONNA GET WORSE. WE CAN'T JUST STAND BY AND LET IT HAPPEN. SO ANYWAY. I APPRECIATE YOUR BILL VERY MUCH- I SEE IT IS MAYBE ONE SLIVER OF PART OF A SOLUTION FOR THE BIGGER PROBLEM- BUT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BUT IN THE MEANWHILE- JUST WHAT YOU'RE ASKING US TO DO IS NOT UNREASONABLE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEAR THE GOVERNMENT. YOU MAY CLOSE. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND DIVE. I DO IN IT- IN MY CLOTHES JUST ADDRESSING SOME OF THE POINT SAID THAT THE OPPOSITION REYES AND I THINK. MAKE A COUPLE CLARIFYING POINTS- SO I DO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE WHEN WE HEAR THESE STORIES THESE ARE NOT OVERDOSE DEATHS THESE ARE POISONING. I'M AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE SENTINEL IS DIFFERENT. TWO GRAINS OF SAND TWO GRAINS OF SAND IS ENOUGH TO KILL A CAT. WE'VE GOT TO TREAT IT DIFFERENTLY WE'VE GOT TO TREAT IT LIKE THE DEADLY AND DANGEROUS POISON THAT IT IS. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT. GOING AFTER USERS IT'S NOT ABOUT GOING AFTER LOW LEVEL DEALERS TRACKING NOT TRAFFICKERS. TWO GRAMS DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT THAT'S ONE THOUSAND ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE TO SAYS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND MEET MICHAEL REALLY IS IT AND I THINK OUR STATE SCHOOL NEEDS TO BE THAT WE NEED TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN. REHABILITATION AND CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION- BUT FOR FIRM PENALTIES FIRM PENALTIES FOR BAD ACT. AND MEMBERS. I AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT THIS BILL CAN COMPLEMENT CALIFORNIA'S INCREASE INVESTMENT IN TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION AND I DO THINK WE NEED TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS- AND LASTLY I'LL JUST SAY. I AM THE MOM IS TWO TEENAGE BOYS I'VE GOT A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOY AND A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOY AND WHEN I HEAR. STORIES LIKE SAKS STORY AND ALEXANDER STORY. IT BREAKS MY HEART AND I'LL BE HONEST IT'S A MAMA. KEEPS ME AWAKE AT NIGHT AND HE LEGISLATOR IT KEEPS ME AWAKE AT NIGHT AND- WE KNOW. THIS IS AN URGENT PUBLIC HEALTH SAYS AND I HOPE LIKE ME IN YOUR HEART YOU KNOW WE NEED TO ACT WITH URGENCY. TO ADDRESS US AND TOP WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY. KING AND I AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK ANNOUNCED WANNA THANK YOUR WITNESSES. FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO COME HERE. AND- BRING THIS STORY TO THIS COMMITTEE IS NOT EASY- TO TELL THE WORLD ABOUT A TRAGEDY IN YOUR IN YOUR FAMILY IN YOUR LIFE AND- I COMMEND YOU. FOR YOUR COURAGE DEBATE BEFORE THIS DISC COMMITTEE AND SPEAK YOUR TRUTH- I TO HAVE A FRIEND. AFTER AMERICAN FRIEND I WENT TO COLLEGE WITH WHOSE NEPHEW- WORKED HIS **** OFF TO GET INTO THE MILITARY ACADEMY. I HAD FEDERAL AND DIED WAS RECENTLY IN THE STORIES THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT THE MILITARY ACADEMY SOMEONE DIED ONE OF WHICH AFTER AMERICAN MALE IF YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS YOUR **** OFF TO GET INTO A MILITARY ACADEMY. AND AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE. IT IS UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT AND HAVE HIS LIFE SNUFFED OUT. IN AN INSTANT WHEN HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO GRADUATING- TO BE ABLE TO SERVICE COUNTRY. AND- AND DO A HIS LIFE- THAT COULD HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY THINGS AND SO I BELIEVE THIS IS A CRISIS. I BELIEVE THAT AB. SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE- THAT WE WILL PUT BEFORE I GENUINE BELIEVE WE WILL PUT BEFORE THIS BODY- EDGY MOVE FORWARD WITH IT AND IT GOES BEFORE ON THE FLOOR. AND WE CREATE THIS THIS TASK FORCE THIS CALIFORNIA BUT NO ABUSE TASK FORCE TO LOOK AT THIS. AND I URGE I INSIST AND I DEMAND THAT THIS FAMILY- WORKS WITH THIS TASK FORCE SO THEY KNOW THE URGENCY. I HOPE I WISH MY DEMAND THAT. THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN. CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THIS TASK FORCE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY- IF THIS DOES NOT GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WE MAY END UP WITH. DISSOLUTIONS YOU YOU'VE IDENTIFIED. BUT WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT EVERYTHING COMPREHENSIVELY. AND COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. BECAUSE WE'VE DONE PIECEMEAL BEFORE AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS IF IT. YES WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER COULD YOU FELT LIKE YOU DID SOME BUT IT DOESN'T WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT THE TASK FORCE THAT WILL. SOLVE HIGHER PROBLEM AND GET A SPONSOR ROAD TO ENDING THIS SCOURGE. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS IS A SCOURGE BONTA. AND SO I. I AM GOING TO NOT ONLY PUSH FOR THE FINAL TASK FORCE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I MAKE SURE. THAT THE INFORMATION YOU GAVE US TODAY BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T GET OUT THIS COMMITTEE. BECOMES PART OF THAT TASK FORCE TO BECOME A PART OF THAT DISCUSSION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT I THINK IS ESSENTIAL AND I THINK THE FAMILIES THAT ARE HERE TODAY. NEED TO BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THAT. URGENTLY I CAN'T SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I THINK THE TASK FORCE MAY COME ACK AND SAY ULTIMATELY. THIS IS. DESCRIPCI THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION NOT JUST PART OF THE SOLUTION INSIDE TO SWEAR SURE WE LOOK AT ALL ASPECTS OF IT BEFORE WE MOVE ON IN THE SECOND. WHAT MEANT SECTOR CALL THE ROLL ON AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER REALLY NO DANCER DAHLE LACKEY. BLACKIE I BONA. BONTA NOT VOTING BRIAN BRIAN NOT VOTING CORK CORK NOW SANTIAGO SEYARTO HI THERE TÔI. SO THE MEASURE FAILS THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT I BELIEVE WE HAVE A- MR KILEY. HI. THE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE CHICAGO. AB SEVENTEEN- EIGHT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS MEASURE TODAY- IT MY BILL- ASKS US TO REASSESS- A SPECIFIC POLICY CHANGE THAT WAS INSTITUTED- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FROM A BILL THAT PASSED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT WAS SB FIFTY FOUR AUTHORED BY- THE FORMER- PRESIDENT PRO TEM- OF. I THE BILL THAT RATED A LOT OF. CONTROVERSY AT THE TIME- IT WAS KNOWN FORMALLY AS THE CALIFORNIA VALUES ACT OFTEN CALLED THE SANCTUARY STATE BILL- I WAS IN MY FIRST YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE AT THE TIME- AND AT THE TIME AND SINCE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF STRUCK BY THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN. SORT OF THE- THE POLITICAL SYMBOLISM OF THE BILL OR THE RHETORIC ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ON THE ONE HAND- AND THE ACTUAL POLICY- THAT IT IMPLEMENTS ON THE OTHER AS YOU KNOW THE US THE AUTHOR AND THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. AT THE TIME- SORT OF USED IT- SEND THE MESSAGE THAT WOULD STICK. WELCOME PLACE. I WAS DEAD SENATE PASSAGE THAT WERE- YOU KNOW WHEN IN FAVOR OF THE GRANT AND SO FORTH- BUT WHAT WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY DID. I IT YOU KNOW DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF IMMIGRANTS IT DOESN'T THING CERTAINLY FOR. THE MET AND WE FUNDS WERE. OUR AFTER STATING THAT THE DO ANY EITHER- FOR- UNDER IMMIGRANTS- SO LONG AS THEY HAVE NOT VIOLATED OUR CRIMINAL LAWS IN ADDITION TO- VIOLATING IMMIGRATION LAW AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT IT ACTUALLY HAS MAINTAINED SOME CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE COUNTRY- ILLEGAL IT IS A CRIME- COMMITTEE I'M THE BILL EXEMPTS- WHO IT CARVES OUT SO IT WAS A VERY VERY SPECIFIC- POLICY CHANGE- THAT WAS USED TO MAKE THESE- BROAD CLAIMS AND I THINK THAT THE REASON FOR THAT IS CALIFORNIA IT ALREADY GONE SO FAR IN ONE DIRECTION WHEN IT CAME TO ALL. MATT IT'S KIND OF. FIVE ARE TO MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT- SOME WANTED TO MAKE AT THAT TIME AND THE REASON THAT THIS WAS LAST IS THIS IS A LONG BEEN A VERY BIPARTISAN- THREE PAST ADMINISTRATIONS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHETHER IT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA- PRESIDENT BUSH AND PRESIDENT REAGAN OR PRESIDENT CLINTON THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A CONSISTENT POLICY THAT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT FOCUSES FIRST AND FOREMOST. ON THAT TO HAVE A COME IN OFF IT WILL. THE BIPARTISAN. EITHER THIS IS BILL SB FIFTY FOUR I BENNETT AND THERE WERE. A LOT OF ALARMS RAISED AT THE TIME AS TO WHAT THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES FORGET THE POLITICAL PART OF IT BUT THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACTUAL POLICY CHANGE- WOULD BE. I AM STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION AMONG OTHERS- WARNED THAT THIS WOULD HAMPER THE ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT- IN THE IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT- THIS READ DANGER PEOPLE. WERE NOT ABLE TO CAN YOU TO COMMIT MS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND ON PERSONAL THE PREDICTIONS HAVE HAVE EMPLOYEE AND TRAGICALLY. BORN OUT AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT THE EXAMPLES THE BUT THERE IS ONE. THAT IS. VERY AND- I HIS ONE OF THE MOST HEINOUS CRIMES I'VE EVER HEARD OF IT HAPPENED VERY CLOSE TO HERE I JUST A FEW MILES FROM THIS CAPITAL WHERE THERE WAS A MAN. WHO WENT INTO A CHURCH AND MURDERED HIS OWN THREE DAUGHTERS THEIR CHAPERONE AND THEN TOOK HIS OWN LIFE- AND THIS WAS JUST A- COUPLE MONTHS AGO ON FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH AND WHAT WE LEARNED SHORTLY AFTER- THIS THIS HEINOUS CRIME. IS THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL HAD IN FACT BEEN IN POLICE CUSTODY JUST FIVE DAYS EARLIER AND THE REASON HE WAS IN POLICE CUSTODY WHILE FOR ASSAULTING. A PEACE OFFICER AND THIS DIMENSION SPECIFICALLY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WITH SB FIFTY FOUR PASSED THIS IS MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY BY THE STATE SHERIFF ASSOCIATION. IS ONE OF MANY MANY. TIMES AT THAT BUT WHAT I BUT OUR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THIS. A POLICE OFFICER THAT'S THIS SAID. IN THEIR STATEMENT BOB TO THE A GOOD. WHAT HERE. I THIS INDIVIDUAL IN CUSTODY FOR ASSAULTING A PEACE OFFICER IS IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY- THE IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES ASKED TO BE NOTIFIED OF HIS RELEASE BUT BECAUSE OF THIS SPECIFIC POLICY CHANGE THAT SB FIFTY FOUR PUT INTO PLACE- THAT THEY WERE NOT NOTIFIED. AND THEN HE FIVE DAYS LATER WENT ON TO COMMIT VERY. HEINOUS CRIME AND SO- YOU KNOW I THINK IT CAN REASONABLY BE INFERRED THAT IF THIS LEGISLATURE HAD NOT MADE THE POLICY CHANGE IF. GOVERNOR BROWN NOT SIGNED THAT INTO LAW. I THIS PERSON WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COMMIT. THAT CRIME AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T EXPECT THE MEMBERS AT LEAST ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE I TO ADOPT MY OWN VIEWS ON ON IMMIGRATION WHOLESALE- OR ON PUBLIC SAFETY. DO. THINK WE HAVE. A CLIP. I'VE HOW A PUBLIC THE- BOB HAS AN ACTIVE I IS A PROXY CAUSE ARE REALLY A BUT FOR CAUSE OF SUCH A HORRIFIC TRAGEDY IT IS INCUMBENT ON US TO REVISIT WHETHER THAT IS SOUND POLICY- TO WEIGH COST VERSUS BENEFITS FRANKLY I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY BENEFITS TO THIS LAW BUT EVEN IF YOU DO I THINK THAT IT'S INCUMBENT TO WEIGH THOSE BENEFITS AGAINST THE CLEARLY. ESTABLISHED COSTS AND SO THAT'S THE REASON I'M PRESENTING THIS BILL TODAY- I THINK THAT AT THE VERY LEAST IT MERITS A DEBATE- BY THE FULL ASSEMBLY AND SO I WOULD ASK FOR A NIGHT OUT. THANK YOU. AND DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES I BELIEVE WE HAVE ONE WITNESS ON THE LINE KNOWLTON- CRIME VICTIMS UNITED. SO AT&amp;T OPERATORS IS MISS KNOWLTON ON THE LINE RIGHT NOW.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TIME AND HELPING US ENGAGE WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS PROCESS I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING ON ISSUES OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS TO ENSURE THIS BILL ACHIEVES THIS GOAL TO ENSURING GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY SEVEN WILL REPEAL A CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION WHICH HAS HAMPERED THE ABILITY OF CIVILIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO CONDUCT THEIR INVESTIGATIONS CIVILIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OVERSIGHT AGENCIES HAVE OPERATED AS AN I DID CHECK ON LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS HAVE HELPED ENSURE CLOSER TO ENGAGE MISCONDUCT ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF A TWENTY AT THE TWO THOUSAND SIX K. TWENTY SUPREME COURT DECISION. KNOWN AS THE COPLEY PRESS PRESS INC VERSUS SUPERIOR COURT THESE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO WITHHOLD FROM THE PUBLIC MOST IF NOT ALL OF THEIR RECORDS OF INVESTIGATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT MISTER. THIS IS THE COURT IN THE COPLEY PRESS IN CASE HELD THAT RECORDS AND INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM RECORDS OF CIVILIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OVERSIGHT AGENCIES ARE CONFIDENTIAL PERSONNEL RECORDS. AND COULD NOT BE DISCLOSED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. PRIOR TO THE PIVOTAL DECISION CIVILIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OPERATED WITH MUCH GREATER TRANSPARENCY. THE CIVIL UNREST IN THE WAKE OF THE MURDER OF JUDGE GEORGE FLOYD AT THE HANDS OF FORMER MINNEAPOLIS POLICE OFFICER DEREK SIOBHAN. AND NUMEROUS OTHER SIMILAR ACTIONS COMMITTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT HIGHLIGHTS THE URGENT NEED FOR THE PUBLIC TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS. CURRENT STATUTE DOES NOT GIVE THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ISSUE COMPLAINTS OR THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE MUCH INFORMATION OR INSTRUCTION ABOUT CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT FINDINGS. CONSEQUENTLY HARM TO PERSON GETS A SIMPLE STATEMENT. YOUR COMPLAINT ON SUSTAINED. A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCEDURES USED TO HOLD THESE AND LAW THE MONTFORT'S MEANT WITH WHO HARM HURT OR KILLED ON. ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ROADS AT THE PUBLIC TRUST AND MAKES ALL OF US LESS SAFE. WHY AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY SEVEN IS URGENTLY NEEDED. AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY SEVEN IS A FRESH APPROACH. BUILDING OFF OF THE LONGSTANDING AND PRINCIPLED COMMITMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE TOWARD INCREASING. THANK YOU AND AS WITNESSES WITH E TODAY I HAVE LARRY WHITE HAS BEEN HERE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE DAY THANK YOU. A MEMBER OF THE OPEN COALITION FOR POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REGINA JACKSON A RECENT CHAIR AND CURRENT MEMBER OF THE OAKLAND POLICE COMMISSION. WHO WILL BE APPEARING BY PHONE. THANK YOU WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN AND THEN WE'LL GO TO LINE- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I AM MY NAME IS LARRY WHITE I AM A VOLUNTEER ATTORNEY WITH THE- OAKLAND BASED COALITION FOR POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ARE THE ORGANIZATION THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING CREATING AND- GETTING AS A OF VOTE ON CHANGES THE CITY CHARTER IN OAKLAND TO CREATE THE STRONGEST OF CIVILIAN POLICE REVIEW OVERSIGHT ORGANIZATION PROBABLY IN THE STATE PERHAPS IN THE COUNTRY- AND I'LL TELL YOU WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM AS I'VE I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE ALL DAY LISTENING TO THE VERY WEIGHTY MATTERS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DEALING WITH- AND- AND- ARE CONCERNED. IN OAKLAND AND ACROSS THE STATE IS- MAKING SURE PARTLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE POLICE ARE EFFECTIVE AND BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY CRIME. ARE IN LARGE PART BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE- IN THE WAY WE THE WAY WE DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD ON THAT IS TO TRUE BUT TRY TO CREATE TRUST IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE POLICE AND THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE THAT TRUST IS TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MISCONDUCT- AND THAT'S WHY WE OF- A- SPONSOR THIS BILL AND WE ARE. VERY EXCITED THE POSSIBILITY OF IT PASSING BECAUSE- UNDER CURRENT LAW. OF POLICE RECORDS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT ARE CONFIDENTIAL ON EXCEPT FOR EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS THAT ARE IN THE LAW. OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS CHANGE THAT FOR CIVILIAN POLICE OVERSIGHT OPERATIONS. RECORDS WOULD BE NON CONFIDENTIAL EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS- AND THIS IS NOT A NEW IT'S NOT NEW IN CALIFORNIA AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER POINTED OUT THIS WAS THE CASE BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT THROUGH A CLOAK OF SECRECY OVER OVER ALL POLICE RECORDS BEFORE THAT. IF A PERSON- IF AS A CIVILIAN WHO HAD BEEN MISTREATED BY POLICE OFFICER BROUGHT A COMPLAINT TO IN THE OVERSIGHT AGENCY THEY WOULD KNOW THE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ATTEND A HEARING. ON THAT COMPLAINT THEY WOULD BE THEY WOULD KNOW THE NAME OF THE OFFICER THEY WOULD KNOW THE CHARGES THEY WOULD THEY WOULD KNOW THE CHARGES- THEY WOULD KNOW THAT WHETHER WITNESSES WERE INTERVIEWED THEY WOULD KNOW THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS. UP AND THEY WOULD KNOW THE DISCIPLINE IMPOSED IF THERE WAS ANY DISCIPLINE IMPOSED. UNDER CURRENT LAW NONE OF THAT IS AVAILABLE. THE NEW THEY WON'T BE A PERSON WHO HAS A COMPLAINT. WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT THE FINAL DISPOSITION OTHER WORDS IT WILL BE SUSTAIN NOT SUSTAINED- EXONERATED SO ON BUT EVEN ASSISTING CASE THEY WILL NOT KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE- WHAT THE PUNISHMENT WAS SO- HOW CAN HOW CAN WE BUILD TRUST BETWEEN THE THERE IS THIS COMPLETE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THAT AND N. WOULD MAKE THAT ALL THAT INFORMATION THAT WAS AVAILABLE BEFORE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AGAIN- YOU HAVE A MINUTE LET ME GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE- OR L. ME ON BECAUSE I KNOW I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME SO JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT AS A RESULT OF- A LAWSUIT. BASED ON THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT BUT A LAWSUIT BY SOME MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS WHICH DISCOVERED THAT IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND CALIFORNIA. BETWEEN THE BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. THERE HAD BEEN SEVENTY CASES OF POLICE DOGS BITING. CIVILIANS INCLUDING AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY. NOBODY KNEW ABOUT THIS FOR FIVE YEARS NOBODY KNEW ABOUT THIS. UNTIL A MEDIA ORGANIZATION THAT HAD ENOUGH A MONEY AND EMPOWER TO BRING A LAWSUIT WAS ABLE TO BRING IT TO LIGHT THIS KIND OF PATTERN OF MISCONDUCT. WOULD BE UNDER IF OUR BILL WAS WERE PASSED YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE THIS KIND OF MISCONDUCT COULD GO ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS BECAUSE IT WOULD BE. THE COMPLAINTS WOULD BE IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC THEY WOULD KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HOW CAN WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM UNLESS PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE AYE ON THIS BILL. AND YOU HAVE A WITNESS ON THE FILE- EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR COULD YOU BRING THAT WITH TO SEND FOR ANOTHER MINUTE. HELLO MY TURN REGINA JACKSON. YES- SO THANK YOU CHAIR- JOHN LAWYER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION THANK YOU LARRY FOR SHARING THE DETAILED OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED CHANGE IN LAW AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBER BONTA FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND PROVIDE PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS REGINA JACKSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOB YOU MENTIONED ONE OF MY MANY WILL BECAUSE OF THE VOLUNTEER APPOINTEE TO THE OAKLAND POLICE COMMISSION ASSEMBLY BODY FOR THE CITY OF OAKLAND SERVING THE PEOPLE OF. MY PASSERBY'S THAT IN TWENTY AND I HAVE A THIRD AS CHAIR FOR THREE YEARS IT'S BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST. AND GONE SHE JUST. THE PURPOSE OF THE- COMPLETE COMMIT IS TO- OVERSEE THE OAKHAM DEPARTMENT TO INSURANCE POLICIES PRACTICES AND CUSTOM CONFORM TO NATIONAL STANDARDS OF CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING. AND OVERSEEING THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL LED BY THE CIVLIAN OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY POLICE REVIEW AGENCY CPR AND LED BY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AGENCY WHICH- INVESTIGATES POLICE CONDUCT AND RECOMMENDS DISCIPLINE. I SURE ALL THIS TO EMPATHIZE IN AB TWO FIVE FIVE SEVEN WOULD DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR WORK AND THAT OF THE AGENCIES WE OVERSEE. ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TO THE OAKLAND POLICE COMMISSION VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO SUPPORT AB TWO FIVE FIVE SEVEN. WE ARE NOT ALONE AS YOU SEE A BROAD COALITION OF REGISTERED SUPPORTERS. THE BILLION OVERSIGHT AGENCIES HAVE BEEN CREATED BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE OF THE CONVINCING EVIDENCE. THAT POLICE ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY MONITOR AND DISCIPLINE THEMSELVES. THESE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN CREATED BY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SHOULD STATE LEGISLATION LOCAL ORDINANCES AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL CONCENTRICALLY. AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPALITIES INCLUDING MOST OF OUR LARGEST CITIES HAVE ESTABLISHED CIVILIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OVERSIGHT BOARDS TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OF POLICING ACTIVITIES IN THE COMMUNITY. THEY ALL SERVE AS A MEANS TO CREATE AND SUSTAIN NECESSARY AND REQUIRED REFORMS IN POLICY AND PRACTICE. AS SUCH OVERSIGHT ABOUT BODIES AND AGENCIES CANNOT FULLY FUNCTION AS INTENDED ONE OF THE OUTCOMES AND IMPACT OF THEIR WORK CAN BE DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC. CURRENTLY THE COMMISSION I CERVANTES AND THE CIVILIAN INVESTIGATORY AGENCY WE OVERSEE ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED AND WHAT FINANCED CAN BE DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC. SO MUCH SO THAT I FEAR WE CONTINUE TO ERODE THE TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. IMAGINE A PERSON THE SERVER SIGNIFICANT HARM AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY- MUSTER UP THE COURAGE TO REPORT THAT HARM AFTER NEARLY A YEAR THEY RECEIVED A NOTICE LIMITED TO A SINGLE WORD. I'M STAYING EXONERATED OR UNFOUNDED. SUBSEQUENTLY THERE INFORMED THAT THE PERSON WHO HARM THEM THE REINSTATED ONCE AGAIN WEARING A BADGE IN UNISON. NOW THE COMMUNITY IS ASKED TO TRUST THE PROCESS. RESULTED IN A FINDING WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. FINDINGS OF THE INVESTIGATION MONTHS SHOULD BE RELEASED WOMEN OFFICERS HAVE BEEN CLEARED THE LONG TERM. THE INFORMATION RELATING TO AN INVESTIGATION NOT RESULTING IN ASSISTING FUNDING OF MISCONDUCT. IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AB TWO FIVE FIVE SEVEN WILL ENHANCE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY POLICE AND CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT BODIES. IF YOU REVEREND LARRY MENTIONED TRANSPARENCY YES MA'AM YES SIR TRANSPARENCY AND FLEXIBILITY LATENCIES ABILITY TO HOLD LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABLE IS WHAT WILL BUILD THE TRUST WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL WHO MUST EXECUTE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY CONSTITUTIONALLY AND EQUITABLY. IT IS CRITICAL MORE THAN EVER THE DECISION CONCERNING COMMUNITY POLICING OCCUR IN THE FULL LIGHT OF DAY YOUR COMMUNITIES CAN UNDERSTAND PRECISELY THE SCOPE OF THE SYSTEMATIC. SYSTEMIC PROBLEM OF ABUSE OF POLICE TACTICS SOMEONE A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN DO THE BEST ELIMINATE THOSE ABUSES. THIS BILL IS PRACTICAL HI MOM AND THAT'S A FAIRLY I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. AND NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM- ANY WITNESSES IN ROOM IN SUPPORT.

HI MY NAME IS CAROL DRIVES IN I AM A CULT MEMBER AND SEIU TEN TO ONE AND THE COALITION OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY IN OAKLAND AND I AM SPEAKING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWO FIVE FIVE SEVEN THANK YOU THANK YOU HOWEVER ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DAVID NYSTAGMUS. THE WITNESSES THERE IN ROME BETTER IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND SHAUN MUTCHLER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION OF RECORDS SUPERVISORS AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY ON IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY SEVEN- TWO SIGNIFICANT PIECES OF LEGISLATION OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AND SB SIXTEEN HAVE BEEN AND MADE SEVERAL CLASSES OF PEACE OFFICER PERSONNEL RECORDS. DISCLOSEABLE TO THE PUBLIC. HOWEVER IN SO DOING- THOSE MEASURES GENERALLY LIMITED DISCLOSURE TO RECORDS REGARDING SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF MISCONDUCT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES- AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY SEVEN GREATLY EXPANDS THE UNIVERSE OF RECORDS THAT WOULD BE PUBLIC. AND OFFERS ONLY A MODEST ABILITY TO BE DACTYLS RECORDS IN LIMITED FASHION AS A FOIL TO THIS MASSIVE BLOW TO OFFICER PRIVACY. AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF RECENT LEGISLATION ARE STILL BEING SORTED OUT AND SIMPLY ALLOWING ANY PEACE OFFICER PERSONAL RECORDS THAT FIND THEIR WAY TO CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT BODY DEVIATES FROM DESPAIRED OF PROTECTING EMPLOYEE PRIVACY. FOR THESE REASONS AND THOSE STATED ABOVE- WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND I BELIEVE REPRESENTATIVE FROM PORAC CALCIFIED. YES SIR DAVID MISTAKE ME. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR ON BEHALF OF PORAC. BY LABOR LAW PRACTICE FOCUSES ON REPRESENTING. PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AND THEIR UNIONS AND MY LAW ENFORCEMENT CLIENTS UNDERSTAND THE CONTINUING NEED FOR POLICE REFORM. THAT'S WHY WE WORK TIRELESSLY WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH THE LEADERSHIP ON USE OF FORCE STANDARDS. TRAINING THE CERTIFICATION AND OF COURSE INCREASE TRANSPARENCY ALTHOUGH WELL INTENDED AB TWO FIVE FIVE SEVEN WHAT AND DO THE IMPORTANT WORK OF SENATOR SKINNER. WITH RESPECT TO SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AND SIXTEEN. I PERSONALLY WORK WITH HER TO FIND COMMON GROUND AMONG THE STAKEHOLDERS AND STRIKE THE PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN THE DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINED SERIOUS MISCONDUCT IN THE LEGITIMATE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF OFFICERS AGAINST THE DISCLOSURE OF UNPROVEN OR MINOR ALLEGATIONS. THIS BILL WOULD DISCARD THAT LEGISLATIVE WORK THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND ESSENTIALLY CONVERT ALL PERSONNEL RECORDS INCLUDING UNSUSTAINABLE LOCATIONS. IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT OF THE POLICE DISAPPROVAL AT FEUDED POLICE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS EXISTS. EVEN FOR THIS IS THAT CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARDS DEPEND ON ACCESS TO THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION WHICH IS GRANTED BY THE EMPLOYING AGENCY THEY TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR THE STAFFING TO CONDUCT COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS. AND SO THE CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARDS RIGHT TO INVESTIGATE MAKE FINDINGS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ALL OF THIS THROUGH THE NEXUS OF THE EMPLOYER. AS THE COURTS HAVE RECOGNIZED FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT'S OFFICE OF PUBLIC SAFETY ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH ARE ALL CIVILIAN THEY HAVE FULL ACCESS TO EVERY. COMPLAINT OF MISCONDUCT REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE. M. THAT IS INVESTIGATED BY THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT THEY HAVE EVEN THE ABILITY TO SIT IN DURING THE INTERVIEW OF OFFICERS. IT'S NOT JUST COMPLAINTS THAT THEY RECEIVE AND THEY REVIEW THE FINDINGS THEY GIVE IT. ARE MEANT ARE STILL. IN CHARGE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE DISCIPLINE PROCESS AND THEN ALSO RELEASES AN ANNUAL REPORT YOU CAN FIND IT ON THE WEBSITE TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND AGAIN I THINK IT'S RIGHT TO THE RIGHT BALANCE WHERE IT HAD SUMMARIES. AND WE CAN REVIEW IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT YOU HAVE TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE. BETWEEN LOOKING AT SUSTAIN SERIOUS MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS AS OPPOSED TO JUST ANY ALLEGATION. ANOTHER FACTOR THAT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER IS THAT AGENCIES HAVE A YEAR GENERALLY AND SOMETIMES LONGER TO COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION OF MISCONDUCT. WHAT THAT RESULTS IN REAL LIFE IS THAT THERE'S OFTEN A LAG OF NINE TEN MONTHS BETWEEN A STIGMATIZING ALLEGATION AND THE ULTIMATE FINDING THAT MAY VERY WELL CLEAR AN OFFICER UNDER THIS BILL AND THEN IT'S AN OFFICER WHO'S ACCUSED OF THE STIGMATIZING. ALLEGATION WOULD HAVE THAT AND PUBLICIZE MONTHS BEFORE THEIR NAME IS EVENTUALLY CLEARED AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE CALL. NOT GONNA GET THE SAME POOL. AS THE INITIAL ALLEGATION AND THAT'S WHY SENATOR SKINNER'S WORK WAS SO IMPORTANT IN LOOKING AT. ALLEGATIONS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THIS BILL IN MY VIEW WITH THE SERI AT CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARD FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS ARE ALREADY PUBLIC RECORDS THE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE NSP SIXTEEN ARE THEY INVOLVED SUSTAINED ALLEGATIONS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT WE THINK COURT DECISION. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO GENERATED A RECORD AFTER RECORD FALLS WITHIN THOSE STATUTES IT'S DISCLOSEABLE BY ANY ENTITY THAT POSSESSES THOSE RECORDS AND THOSE BILL SET FORTH A LAUNDRY LIST OF THE TYPES OF DOCUMENTS. THAT ARE DISCLOSEABLE AND SO WHERE YOU HAVE AN OUT OF THREE. ADULTS AND AT LEAST A STAINED THIS CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT RECORDS ARE GOING TO BE CORRECTED JUST LIKE THE- WE'RE- I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT I THINK THERE'S SOME UNINTENDED. FROM THIS BILL WHICH WOULD BE TO ENCOURAGE AGE HE'S NOT TO HAVE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT OR SEVERELY REVIEW ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THAT THEY GET OUT OF FEAR THAT THE TYPE OF INFORMATION ON PROVING THAT. COME PUBLIC AND THAT'S NOT A HYPOTHETICAL CONCERN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SAW A FEW YEARS AGO IN THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO WHERE THE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR WAS LOCKED OUT OF ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION. THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND CLOSE IT STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE OF ONLY DISCLOSING SERIOUS MISCONDUCT WANT TO IMPROVE THAT PROTECTS INNOCENT OFFICERS AND ALL GIVES PUBLIC MASON IT NEEDS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. ARE YOU DONE. SIR. I GUESS YOU'RE DONE. YES SOME SO I CAN NOT HEAR ME OKAY- WE'RE NOT GOING TO INTO ROOM FOR ANY ANYONE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION NAME AN ORGANIZATION OR ORGANISE.

WELL MOVING TO LINE THREE TWENTY TWO. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE MICHELLE COLOR WITH ERIN REED AND ASSOCIATES AND I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF PORAC AM CALIFORNIA THIRTY. TOLD ME H. E. AND WE ARE AGREEMENT WITH IN AGREEMENT WITH EVERYTHING IN THE FACT THAT THEY. THIS IS MATTHEW REALLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE I THINK YOU. THANK WE NOW BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS MR WORK GOOD FRIENDS AND WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON THIS. WHAT I'VE SAID IS I THERE'S STILL. THERE'S ALMOST NOTHING THAT I CAN SUPPORT. BOB BUT I WILL GIVE YOU AN AYE VOTES YOU CAN GO ON TO JUDICIARY AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. BOB BECAUSE YOU NEED TO GET THE FEEDBACK FROM THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THIS COMMITTEE. SO THE TWO PROBLEMS I HAVE HIS NUMBER ONE. THIS WOULD ONLY CHANGE THINGS FOR JURISDICTIONS WHICH HAVE A POLICE REVIEW BOARD UP AND SOME OF THE LARGER CITIES TO HAVE THEM BUT MY DAHLE. SO THAT IT WOULD NOT SOME YOU SHOULD. PLEASE PART OF THE OTHER THING WE HAVE WORK CARE AND CAN WE DISK THE- AB ONE CAN SCHOOL SO WHAT FOR TO- HOW BILLS BY SKI. WHICH TO ME MY MIND MAYBE YOU DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT CAN BE DISCLOSED IN. THE PRESS INTO THIS AND IT'S GREAT- AND THERE PROBABLY ARE MORE THINGS WE CAN DISCLOSE BUT THE REASON GIVEN BY UNPACKED CHARGE OF IT COULD RUIN A PERSON'SREPUTATION AND YET THERE COULD BE NO EVIDENCE FOR IT AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND IF THAT. ON THE END OF IT- BEING A POLITICIAN. GOD KNOWS THAT PROBABLY DOES HAPPEN TO US MATTER OF FACT THERE'S MY WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE I CAN POINT OUT A FEW THINGS. BOB BUT- WE DO THAT BECAUSE- BECAUSE OF BUT POLICE OFFICERS SHOULD BE IN THAT POSITION SO WE JUST NEED TO. NATIONALEN SHOULD BE DISCLOSED AND I THINK THERE PROBABLY IS SOME BUT THIS IS JUST TOO BROAD FOR ME SO AGAIN I'M GET MY IPHONE THE ADVANCE OF THE- INPUT. YES SLAPPY YEAH LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL YOUR I DON'T DISAGREE THAT AB FACTORS I FULLY HARDLY AGREE THAT OKAY BILLION TRANSPARENCY HAS TO BE PART OF MAX STRUS FORTUNATE OF. BUT I WILL TELL YOU AS YOUNG ONE HERE ON THIS EDDIE. ZACKS DOT TESTING TIONS AGAINST- ALLEGATIONS. AND SOMETIMES ACTIONS COMMITTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT- IN THE HEARTS OF SOME PEOPLE THERE IS A RETALIATORY AND SENATE TO PURSUE THIS PROCESS AND TO ABUSE IT AND- IT'S UNFORTUNATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS BUT IT IS A REALITY. AND YOU. STE IT'S VERY DANGEROUS VERY DANGEROUS AND IT DOESN'T HELP THE TRUST THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE INTENTION. AND THE FACT IS TO ROADS THAT THAT CLOUDS TRUTH. AND I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE INTENTION OF ANY LEGISLATIVE EFFORT- I WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT- THE OTHER BILLS THAT- HAVE IMPROVED- THE DISCLOSURE AND THE TRANSPARENCY ARE IMPORTANT TO BUILD BACK THIS TRUST BUT I THINK THAT THIS GOES. THE ONLY. OKAY SHINS IT CAN N. AND IT WILL RUINSOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME VERY VERY. OUTRAGEOUS DEMANDED I'VE INVESTIGATED AND SOMETIMES THOSE OUTRAGEOUS DEMANDS PROVED TO BE TRUE. HOWEVER IF THEY'RE NOT TRUE AND THEY'RE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC IT DOES A HUGE DISSERVICE TO ALL PARTIES INVOLVED AND SO THEREFORE NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I'M REALLY REALLY UNDERSTAND. THIS BEING. SANTIAGO YEAH I HAD THAT LOOK AT A- I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE THAT WORKS ON THANK YOU FOR MOVING THE CONVERSATION. FOR- I JUST I DON'T WANNA SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON ECHO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ECHOED AND BUT THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. ACCUSATIONS ARE UNFOUNDED. AND THOSE THINGS A PERSON TO DO I MEAN WE HAVE APPLE TRANSPARENCY TO GET SOMETHING OUT PERSONS AND- PRIVATE HEALTH DECISIONS RIGHT AT. BUT IT IF THIS MAKE UP NUMBER SEVEN OF US HERE WERE TO AN OFFICER THAT. YOU MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING WHEN YOU HAD A BILLS SEVEN ITEMS GOING RECORD UNLESS THEY'RE PROVEN I DO BUT IT COULD. TAKE A DAMAGE SOMEBODY'S LIFE AND REPUTATION- OF THE NOBILITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES ARE THE FLIP SIDE. AND I RECOGNIZE THE THIS WILL MOVE AND IT SHOULD BUT I JUST WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT PIECE. DOWN THE LINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FULL TRANSPARENCY IN TRADE AND TRYING TO IMPROVE ON PUBLIC SAFETY. N. IN SOME PLACE WERE MAY NOT BE MERITED WHETHER OUR ACCUSATIONS THAT ARE NOT- THE AVERA. WHAT'S THE RIGHT WORD SAY OR THEY'RE NOT- LEGITIMATE WITH A LOT WITH WITH WITH THAT WILL SUSTAIN IS ONE THING BUT ALSO WITH A COULD BE A FRIVOLOUS ACCUSATIONS AFTERWARDS LOOKING FOR OUR- WITH GERMAN. OR SUSTAIN IF YOU WILL I THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AND HOPE THAT YOU WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT. THE TAKE A LOOK AT IT MORE COMMITTEE WOULD BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT IT IS IN THE PUBLIC AND- EVEN HAVE. FOR YEARS. SIGN UP. BELIEVE IN OAKLAND. ON THE SENATE SIDE HAD HAD HAD THAT DEBATE- INSTRUCT THAT BALANCE SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR FROM THE FOUR BUT JUST WANT TO PUT MY TWO CENTS OUT THERE. ON THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU MAY CLOSE. WHAT I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE FOR THE FEEDBACK AND- AND DO YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN GET BACK TO THE PRE COPLEY MOMENT ACTUALLY WILL. R. O. IN THE- IS IT BEING A TO A PROVIDE THE GREAT LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS UP AND CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT IN THAT BODY I DO RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL SO THAT OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED TERMS OF. PRIVILEGE DON'T PART OF WEAPONS THAT CAN BE USED AGAINST OUR OUR PEACE OFFICERS WHICH IS NOT THE INTENTION ALL OF THE BILL ENGINE IT PROVIDE CIVILIAN OVER M. IN THE MAY. IN THIS THAT WE JOINT. BUT IT IT FROM UP TO PRESS. AND WE DO HAVE LED THAT HAS BEEN PASSED AND CAREFULLY THREADED THE NEEDLE WE I DO THINK DO THINK WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT THE UNIVERSE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT SEEN- IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DON'T OF SHOT THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY ON. WE'RE TO WORKING WITH THE- I'M ALLIES IN IN THE MY LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES TO TRY TO IDENTIFY A PATH FOR THAT WILL CONTINUE TO THREATEN VERY CAREFUL I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK ON. WITH THAT I RESPECT QUESTION. IN M. WE TALKED TO SOME CLEVER YOU'RE GOING TO CLOSELY LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW I MR SANTIAGO AND MISTER BRIAN AND I COME FROM AN AREA WHERE YOU HAVE- A LOS ANGELES POLICE COMMISSION WHICH WILL WHICH TRIED TO BE AFFECT. THEY HAVE A REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIP. AS OPPOSED TO THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WE'RE TOTALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL- WHERE THE SHERIFF DOESN'T DOESN'T EVEN TALK TO THE OVERSIGHT GROUP AND IS OPEN BE REBELLIOUS TOWARDS IT AND SO I'D I KNOW. WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY IS REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK IT WOULD HELP FOR EXAMPLE. IS IT IT IS HELPED L. A. P. E. N. AND MOVING FORWARD WITH REFORMS AND THINGS THAT NATURE I THINK IT WOULD REALLY HELP THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IF IT WOULD OPEN UP TO CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AND LET PEOPLE SEE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON AND WE COULD GET RID OF WHAT THE DOCTORS. THERE WHETHER THERE'S THIS CORRUPTION WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ABOUT ISN'T. IF YOU ALLOW DISAPPEAR NINETY DAYS WHERE YOU'RE NEED TO LET'S HAVE THAT TRANSPARENCY- AND SO MAYBE THE MODEL. OR THE BEGINNING MODEL MIGHT BE. ON THE LAPD SITES SO- BUT GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS ON TO THE- UP. TO TWO TO. THE NEXT STEP WHICH IS- JUDICIARY I THINK YOU'RE BEGIN TO HASH OUT SOME OF THIS FOR AND SO THE CHURCH RECOMMENDED I- OF THE COMMOTION YOU.

I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL AFTER VERY- ENGAGING DAY- AS WE ALL KNOW. THE CULTURE OF VIOLENCE THAT PERMEATES OUR PRISON SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. UNITED STATES NATIONAL YOUR MAPS IS NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PUBLISHED A STUDY FINDING APPROXIMATELY 21% OF MALE MATES WERE PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED IN A SIX MONTH PERIOD OF TIME. IN IT GEN THE CALIFORNIA SENATOR CONCLUDED IN THEIR TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT THAT DESPITE THE GRADUAL LAWYER LOWERING OF TOTAL INMATES IN PRISON. RECIDIVISM OF THE POPULATION REMAINS STEADY HOVERING AROUND 46% WITH THE TROUBLED PRISON SYSTEM WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO QUELL THESE RATES. IT WILL EXPAND THE TOOL WILL THE PEACE OFFICERS TASKED WITH ENSURING THE SAFETY. OF THE INSTITUTION ORGANIZING IN MADE COHESION. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE PROTECTION OF BOTH THE OFFICERS AND INMATES ALIKE. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE- I THINK MISTER LEVELS HERE YES. AND FOR CANADA BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION. OKAY WHO'S GOING FIRST. MR LEVEL IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN WE'VE MISSED YOU- A LITTLE AND I THINK FOR THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONS SUPERVISOR THIS IS MIKE ON- SEVENTY BETTER OKAY THANK YOU- JOHN LEVEL AND THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION OF THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL. THAT REALLY WILL ENHANCE DOES THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT. SAFETY ALARM IN OUR INSTITUTIONS NOT ONLY FOR INMATES BUT ALSO FOR STAFF- IT ALSO WILL WORK ON THE OTHER END OF THIS TO PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN CUSTODY WHO FIND OUT INFORMATION ABOUT. PRISON DIRECTED POTENTIAL HOMICIDES- NOW I DO WANT TO CORRECT SOMETHING IN THE BILL THAT'S AN ERROR AND PLEASE DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME I HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION IN FACT WHEN MY FATHER PASSED AWAY. WE GAVE IN LIEU OF HIS DONATIONS TO THE ACLU THAT SAID THERE IS- AN ASSERTION THAT IS JUST FACTUALLY INACCURATE- THE- LETTER OF THEIR OPPOSITION SAYS THERE BEEN SEVERAL PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO EXPAND THIS AUTHORITY REFERRING TO THIS BILL. YOU CAN SIMPLY CLOSE THE JEFFORDS. ALL HAVE EITHER BEEN. BY THE LEGISLATURE OR VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THAT IS FACTUALLY INACCURATE ASSEMBLY BILL TWO SIX SIX NINE- BY THE CHAIRMAN- ACTUALLY WAS ADOPTED BY THIS COMMITTEE ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED INTO LAW- I WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED WITH. US SENATE BILL FOUR TO FOUR BY DR PAN WHICH DEALT WITH THE USE OF- PRETEXT COASTER LEVEL COULD YOU- WHY NOT WRAP IT UP BUT I JUST- THAT THE USE OF PRETEXT CALLS IN STUDENT SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES ALSO WAS PASSED. PLEDGE ARE MA'AM. AND SIGNED BOB THE GOVERNOR OF FORD CANNOT WHO'S REALLY AN EXPERT ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS ALSO TESTIFY GOOD GO AHEAD. WHAT I GUESS WAS ST CHAIRMAN'S GONE BUT- AND THE VICE CHAIR BUT I USED TO JUDGE MCCARTY MILAN DAY. AIR MMHM OKAY SO FORD CANNOT TIME OF A MINISTRY RIPPED THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION WE REPRESENT MAJORS AND SUPERVISORS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS AND THE AND OF COURSE IT'S- IN. O. C. WHICHIS OFFICE OF CRAIG SAY. DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK IN THE PRISONS THEIR AGENTS ARE OUT ON THE STREETS AND ELLA THEY WILL THEY MONITOR OF. TRAFFIC BETWEEN THE GANGS ON THE STREETS AND THE INMATES IN THE PRISONS AND- THEY WORK 50% OF THEIR TIME WITH THE F. BY OR- OF THE PEACE OFFICER OF COMMUNITIES. BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS A WHOLE CALIFORNIA ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SAN DIEGO. AND UTILIZED THESE OF CI IS- TO GET INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO INVESTIGATE. OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT- THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR THE JUDGES AREN'T GOING TO GIVE A WARRANT BASED OFF OF COMFORT ACTUAL FOR STATE INFORMATION AND THEY FIND THAT- THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL SOME MAN MADE IN PRISON. OF FOR EITHER UP DROPPING OUT OF THE GATE ANGLE. DOING YOUR DRUG WHATEVER REACH THEY WANT TO SPUR DID. THEY NOTICE THE PER TO PER ROOM THE INMATE AND PUTS THEM IN A SAFE PLACE. SO THEY'VE DONE THEIR JOB SOMEWHAT BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY CAN CONTINUALLY DO THE SAME THING. OF WE CAN'T PROSECUTE HIM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A WARRANT TO GET THE INFORMATION. AND THE INFORMATION WILL BE A PERMISSIBLE IN COURT FOR. YOU COMMIT BURKE- BELOW CANTOR. ALLIES THIS IS WOULD YOU WRAP UP YOUR FIFTH YES SIR PUT A OCS INTO OF. COLD SIX THREE WOULD GIVE THEM THE ABILITY PRY THE P. CALLING FOR THE MURDERS. L. WHICH RIGHT NOW THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THEY THEY DO STOP THE MURDERS THEY TO STOP THE MERGE ON THE STREET A GUY PAROLES THEY WANT TO KILL THEM THE THEY STOP THAT BUT THEY CAN'T PROSECUTE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. A LOT LESS THE- IN PENAL CODE SIX THIRTY THREE ALL RIGHT IT'S- DOES ANYONE IN THE ROOM I WANT TO SPEAK IN FAVOR. OF TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY SIX OUR ORGANIZATION AND POSITION. OKAY WE'LL GET TO THE PHONES LATER- LET'S HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION- I BELIEVE WE'LL HEAR FROM MARGO GEORGE- AND- KAELIN DEAN FROM THE ACLU OR- CHAU IS MARCO HERE YEAH. OKAY ARE THERE SHE IS OKAY. MARCO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ON AND MISS TEEN HAD TO LEAVE- SH YOU HAVE HER LETTER I BELIEVE IN THE PACKET SO THAT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF- FIRST I JUST WANNA SAY. THAT OSC ON WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING TO DO HERE WOULD MAKE THEM A MEGA POLICING ORGANIZATION BECAUSE AS THE PROPONENTS OF SAID THEY ALREADY WORK. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FBI AND WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BOTH OF THOSE GROUPS HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET WARRANTS IF THEY SEE FIT MOREOVER FROM ANYONE WHO'S EVER HAD A PHONE CALL FROM STATE PRISON ARE COMMUNICATED WITH AND WITH MONEY AT THE STATE PRISON. KNOWS THAT EVERY SINGLE PHONE CALL THAT'S GOING OUT FROM THE INSTITUTION OR DURING THE LIMITED TIME- WITH COVERT EXPENDED THE- PHONE CALLS YOUR CONVERSATIONS WERE MONITORED EVEN UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES LAWYER- CLIENT CONVERSATIONS GOT SWEPT UP IN THIS AND THIS WOULD OF COURSE- MAKE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THAT EVEN GREATER. BUT THE REASON THIS IS BAD POLICY IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO REASON FOR. ON OSC TO BE ABLE TO OCS SKEWS ME TO DO THIS BECAUSE- IF LOCAL LONG ENFORCEMENT THAT THERE ARE ALREADY COOPERATING WITH I THINK THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE REQUEST FOR A WARRANT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND EVEN IF THEY WERE OCS WERE TO OBTAIN THE INFORMATION THEY STILL HAVE TO COOPERATE WITH LOCAL PROSECUTORS OR THE U. S. ATTORNEY AND A ORDER TO PROSECUTE ANYTHING. SO ON I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH HERE IS THAT MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE DECIDED THAT THE GANG DATABASE IS OVERBROAD THEY REFUSE TO- PARTICIPATE. IN IT ANY MORE- AND IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR HAS- CRITICIZED IT EXTENSIVELY AS BEING- KANNST GAG GATHERING UP ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHERE THERE IS NO PROVEN GANG ALLEGATION. THIS WOULD CURB THE O. O. C. R. THE ABILITY NOT ONLY TO MONITOR CONVERSATIONS WITH IN THE PRISON WALLS MONITOR CONVERSATIONS BY A PRISONER TO PERSON OUTSIDE BUT IT WOULD GIVE. A C. S. ABILITY TO MONITOR THE CONVERSE. WHEN THE FAMILY- ARE PERSON OUTSIDE IN ANYONE THEY CALLED SO FOR THOSE REASONS. OF WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR CELL PHONE. ALL RIGHT- IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. TO A. B. TWO SEVEN TWO SIX. ALL RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE PHONE. AND YET- WE'RE IT'S AB TWO SEVEN TWO SIX. WE'D LIKE TO HEAR NAME. ORGANIZATION AND WHETHER YOU'RE FOR OR AGAINST SO OPERATOR BY ANYONE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK FOR OR AGAINST TWO SEVEN TWO SIX PLEASE GET ON THE PHONE ZERO IF YOU'RE FOR OR AGAINST. WE DO HAVE LINE A ONE EIGHTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. OLYMPIA CAMPBELL IN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ENACTUS FOUNDATIONAL ONE I THINK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FROM SPEAKING TO- MR- FORD CANUTE YES SIR YES SO WHY IS IT DIFFICULT TO GET AN AUTHORIZATION FOR A WIRETAP FOR THE PRISON INVESTIGATORS ARE YOU SAID THAT THE PROBLEM IS IT'S BASED UPON. THINGSTHAT YOU HEAR AROUND THE PRISON WHY WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM THEY THEY MAKE MOST THEIR CONTACTS THROUGH ILLEGAL CELLPHONES THAT ARE IN THE PRISON THEY DON'T DO IT ON THE EVERYBODY KNOWS. THAT THOSE CITIES ILLEGAL CELLPHONES RIGHT AND MOSTLY INFORMATION COMES FROM CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS OUT ON THE STREETS FEWER JUST SEE AN OCS AGED. THEY THEY LOOK LIKE A GANG MEMBER OR NOTHING LIKE A HOMELESS MAN OR WHATEVER THEY BLEND IN AND THEY GO UNDERCOVER IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY GET THE INFORMATION- WHICH UNDER THE VEHICLE IS SIX THIRTY THREE OVER HEARD. OR THEY'LL HAVE A RECORDER IN OUR POCKET THEY DON'T USE OF WIRETAPS OKAY THE PART OF HEAVY IDEAS IS SO IS THE POLICE BUT 50% OF THE TIME. THEY'RE WORKING WITHOUT THE SCOTTISH THE- AUTHOR. WITHOUT THE POWER OF THE FBI OR THE LOCAL PIZZA OKAY BUT THIS. THIS BILL. HOW DOES IN- I THOUGHT INVOLVED WHAT WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE BILL THEN IF THEY CAN GET THE WHY IS IT THAT THE INFORMATION THEY GET ISN'T. ABLE TO BE USED IN COURT. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET A WARRANT FIRST OKAY BUT WHAT DO THEY NEED TO WARRANT FLORIDA WARRANT OFFICIELLE YOU STATEMENT SO THEN THEY HAVE TO GO GET THE INFORMATION. THE INFORMATION IS NO GOOD OKAY BUT WHAT IS GETTING THE WARRANT FOR. TO INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGATION CURVES CHARACTER SO IT'S NOT A WARRANT FOR A WIRE TAP HER AGE WE DON'T DO THEY DON'T THEY DON'T DO WIRE TAPS SO- SO YOU NEED A WAR JUST TO DO THE INVESTIGATION. YES IT ARE ALLOWS THEM TO PROCEED GET THE INFORMATION NOW IT'S USABLE IN COURT. I SEE. BUT OUR RIGHTS NOT USABLE IN COURT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE WARRANT FIRST YEAH IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. AND SO THERE THEY'RE- THEY'RE CATCHING ALL THIS AND THEY'RE STOPPING THE MURDERS. BUT THEY CAN'T PROSECUTE THE PEOPLE ARE THAT ARE CONSPIRING. I SEE WELL I THINK WE NEED TO PROTECT BOTH THE PRISONERS AND- OUR PRISON GUARD OFFICERS WHO MAY BE UNDER THREAT. THIS IS I THINK PRISON GUARDS THE TOUGHEST JOB IN THE STATE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION. SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- QUESTIONS FROM. COMMENTS MISTER SEYARTO MOTION YET. BUT IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED YES MYSELF AND- MR SANTIAGO. SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE NO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT THIS COMMITTEE- PROTECT BOTH THE INMATE AND THE OFF AND PROCEED WITH AN AYE VOTE. WITH THAT FOR OUR LAST BILL. BY THE WAY MR SECRETARY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THE FORESIGHT TO KEEP THIS ROOM FOR US ALL AFTERNOON THERE WERE TIMES WE COULDN'T DO THIS AND REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND YOUR FINE WORK THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO GO AHEAD AND CALL THE ROLL.
