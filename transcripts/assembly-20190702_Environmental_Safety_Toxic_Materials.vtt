FORM WAS CONTEMPLATED FOR AND I

00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:10.748
AGREE I THINK THIS FITS WITHIN

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:13.117
THAT I GUESS MY CONCERN REMAINS

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:14.918

ADDRESS THE FACT THAT 30% OF

00:44:24.294 --> 00:44:24.962

AND IF 30% WERE BEING PAID OUT

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.534
OF A DIFFERENT SOURCE THE NOT

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:31.735

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:50.580
COMMUNITY WATER WE'VE GONE ROUND

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:52.249
AND ROUND.

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:52.883
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:54.384
ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE BEFORE

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:56.486
POLITICS IN GETTING IT DONE FOR

00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:57.387
THE COMMUNITIES.

00:50:57.454 --> 00:51:00.624
I'M JUST HAPPY IT'S NOT A TAX SO

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:01.825
I WILL BE VOTING.

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:03.126
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:08.165
MADAM VICE CHAIR.

00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:09.366
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN --

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:12.202
SENATOR MINING I I THINK.

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:15.972
WE ALL AGREE ON WHAT YOU'RE

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:17.274
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE I

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.475
THINK WHERE WE HAVE SOME

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:21.912
DISAGREEMENT AS THE FUNDING THAT

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:26.650
IT'S THAT IT'S BEING USED -- I

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.218
REALLY AM HAVING A HARD TIME

00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:30.020
UNDERSTANDING THE JUSTIFICATION

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:33.323
FOR USING CAP AND TRADE FUNDING

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.425
FOR AN ISSUE LIKE THIS AND I

00:51:35.492 --> 00:51:37.961
WONDER -- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:41.565
SPEAK TO THAT AT ALL BECAUSE I'M

00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:43.066
SURE YOU HAVE.

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:44.801
HEARD THE COMMENTS OUT THERE

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:46.870
THAT THE STATE HAS A BUDGET

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:50.207
SURPLUS -- WHY NOT TAP INTO THAT

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:54.144
RATHER THAN USAGI OF FINES WHICH?

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:56.012
IF YOU ASK ME IT'S A VERY WEAK

00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:59.149
LINK TO SUGGEST THAT THIS

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:00.917
PROJECT WOULD REDUCE.

00:52:00.984 --> 00:52:03.153
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IT'S A

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.288
IT'S A BIG STRETCH SO WHAT WOULD

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:07.390
YOU JUST CARRIED IT -- EXPAND ON

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:09.426
THAT BEAT BEFORE I HAVE A COUPLE

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:10.894
OTHER QUESTIONS SURE THINK WELL

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:13.430
AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:14.331
IN.

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:16.333
AGAIN TO ME IT'S NOT THAT BIG A

00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:19.069
STRETCH THE G. G. R. FUND.

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:20.537
WELL IT'S DESIGNED TO REDUCE

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:23.039
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

00:52:23.106 --> 00:52:24.407
IT'S ALSO.

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:26.176
PERFECTLY WITHIN THE AMBIT OF

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:28.578
THAT FUNDING TO PROTECT VICTIMS

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:30.313
OF CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.448
IMPACTS.

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:33.383
IT'S NOT ME IT'S SCIENCE THAT

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.685
LINKS CONTAMINANTS IN WATER

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:37.587
SYSTEMS TO DROUGHT DROUGHT

00:52:37.654 --> 00:52:39.523
CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE WITH

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:41.758
RESPECT TO KNOWN POLLUTERS

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:43.326
NOTHING IN THIS BILL PREVENTS

00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:45.262
ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS AND

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:46.363
REGULATIONS.

00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:47.497
NOTHING PREVENTS THIS

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:49.366
LEGISLATURE FROM CREATING NEW

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:50.834
LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE FOR THE

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:53.637
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO CHOOSE TO GO

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:56.373
AFTER POLLUTERS ALL OF THAT NONE

00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:57.908
OF THAT IS COMPROMISED BY THE

00:52:57.974 --> 00:52:59.376
LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL.

00:52:59.442 --> 00:53:00.877
BUT I THINK MORE BACK TO YOUR

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:02.679
PARTICULAR QUESTION ABOUT THE

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:04.781
NEXUS WE MAY HAVE TO AGREE TO

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:06.216
DISAGREE ON THAT.

00:53:06.283 --> 00:53:09.819
I BELIEVE MUCH OF THOSE WHO LOOK

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:11.888
TO G. G. R. F. IS PROTECTING US

00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:13.557
FROM FUTURE IMPACTS.

00:53:13.623 --> 00:53:15.225
ARE IGNORING THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:17.160
THAT OUR CURRENT VICTIMS THIS

00:53:17.227 --> 00:53:17.861
BILL.

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:20.597
PRIORITIZES THOSE COMMUNITIES IN

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:24.200
IT IT CREATES A RECURRING FUND

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:25.101
FOR TEN YEARS ONLY.

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:26.369
THAT WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT

00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:27.904
HAPPENS TO OUR GENERAL FUND

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:30.173
BUDGET OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.175
THIS GUARANTEES THAT THE

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:33.910
INTENDED BENEFICIARIES OF

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:35.345
ACHIEVING CLEAN SAFE DRINKING

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:37.581
WATER WILL BE PROTECTED

00:53:37.647 --> 00:53:40.717
REGARDLESS OF EXIGENCIES.

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:42.218
IN HOMAGE TO WE'VE ANSWERED THIS

00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:44.854
QUESTION TWICE THE SAME WAY --

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:46.656
WE DO WANT TO GET THIS BILL OUT

00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:48.191
QUICKLY SO WE CAN GET ON TO

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:49.993
OTHER BUSINESS SO WE KNOW YOU

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.728
CAN ALWAYS MAKE A COMMENT I'M

00:53:51.795 --> 00:53:52.596
JUST SAYING HE'S ANSWERED IT

00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:53.863
TWICE ALREADY.

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:55.966
IF YOU NEED TO SAY ANYTHING MORE

00:53:56.032 --> 00:53:58.001
I CAN SAY IT WAS CLOSE.

00:53:58.068 --> 00:53:59.302
NOW IT'S FINE GOING TO YOU'RE

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:00.604
NOT GOING TO WHATEVER YOU WANT

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:02.405
TO SAY I'M FINE THANK YOU MISTER

00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:06.476
CHAIRMAN I WAS TELLING HIM TO BE

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:09.746
QUIET YOU.

00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:14.651
I GET IT ALL RIGHT -- SO.

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:18.788
WE HAD AB ONE HUNDRED WHICH IS

00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:19.389
ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:19.689
[inaudible]

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:21.925
RIGHT.

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:24.494
WITH SOME WITH CHEN MINOR MINOR

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:26.930
CHANGES BUT I NINETY BRALEY 5%

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:29.132
OR MORE IS EXACTLY THE SAME BILL

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:30.333
WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY HAD SEVERAL

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.502
MEMBERS VOTE AGAINST AB ONE

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:33.703
HUNDRED BECAUSE FOR A VARIETY OF

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:34.738
REASONS THAT.

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:36.706
THIS IS NOW AB ONE HUNDRED IN

00:54:36.773 --> 00:54:37.307
FRONT OF US AGAIN [inaudible]

00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:43.880
AND I JUST.

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:44.414
I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY MR

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:45.348
CHAIRMAN I GUESS YOU JUST DIDN'T

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:47.217
REALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR

00:54:47.283 --> 00:54:50.620
ME TO SETTLE MY MIND IN THAT.

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:51.821
THEY USE OF THIS FUNDING JUST

00:54:51.888 --> 00:54:53.857
SEEMS WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE TO

00:54:53.923 --> 00:54:55.692
SUGGEST THAT IT WOULD REDUCE

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:58.228
SIGNIFICANTLY ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY

00:54:58.294 --> 00:54:59.529
THE USE OF THESE FUNDS AS AS AS

00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:01.531
A KIND OF A SLUSH FUND.

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:04.067
THAT SOMEHOW PEOPLE NOT TRUCKING

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:06.503
WATER INTO THEIR COMMUNITY WOULD.

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:08.171
CAUSE A REDUCTION ENOUGH TO

00:55:08.238 --> 00:55:10.273
JUSTIFY THIS I THINK IS LIKE

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.776
SAYING IF YOU GIVE EVERY.

00:55:12.842 --> 00:55:13.977
GIVE EVERY SCHOOL KID AT A

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:16.079
SCOOTER TO GO BACK AND FORTH TO

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:17.514
SCHOOL THEN THAT WILL REDUCE THE

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:18.648
NUMBER OF TRAPS TRIPS ARE

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:20.116
PARENTS ARE MAKING. TO SCHOOL

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:21.217
BACK ON BOARD TO PICK THEM UP

00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:23.186
THERE BY I MEAN I JUST I THINK

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:24.921
IT'S A STRETCH.

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:26.990
pIF YOU COULD.

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:29.626
IF YOU COULD MAYBE DON'T WANT TO

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.728
I MAYBE CAN'T BUT I REALLY WANT

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:34.731
TO HEAR WHY WE ARE TAPPING INTO

00:55:34.798 --> 00:55:35.765
THESE.

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.267
FUNDS THESE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.469
WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:40.904
AND PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD GO

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:43.273
TO SPECIFIC THINGS WHY WE ARE

00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:47.277
USING THAT RATHER THAN -- AT AND

00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:48.712
ALLOCATION OF FUNDS THAT ARE IN

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:50.780
CURRENT EXISTENCE AND THAT WE

00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:54.050
COULD SET ASIDE RIGHT.

00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:55.819
IT BEGS THE QUESTION DO WE THINK

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:57.454
IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO COST MORE

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.455
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT PUTTING

00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:00.190
HER DOLLAR LIMIT ON IT BECAUSE

00:56:00.256 --> 00:56:01.624
WE THINK IT'S GONNA END UP.

00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:04.427
IF YOU CAN ANSWER IF YOU CAN'T I

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:05.829
UNDERSTAND NOW BUT I'LL BE BRIEF --

00:56:05.895 --> 00:56:07.797
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:08.098
[inaudible]

00:56:08.164 --> 00:56:10.133
ADEQUATELY RESOLVE THE CONCERNS

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.601
THAT YOU HAVE.

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:12.936
I WILL SAY.

00:56:13.002 --> 00:56:16.372
THIS BILL PRESENTS A PATHWAY. TO

00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:18.908
ADDRESSING SUCH A CRISIS IN OUR

00:56:18.975 --> 00:56:20.276
STATE RIGHT NOW.

00:56:20.343 --> 00:56:22.078
AND IT DOES SO WITHOUT RAISING A

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:24.147
TAX FOR A FEE WHICH WAS A STRONG

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:26.983
INTEREST OF MANY MEMBERS OF BOTH

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.151
OF OUR HOUSES.

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:30.353
LEADERSHIP HAS AGREED UPON THIS

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.288
I'VE OFFERED MY RECENT SWITCH

00:56:32.355 --> 00:56:33.623
DIDN'T INCLUDE TRUCKING OF

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:34.891
BOTTLED WATER.

00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:36.593
THEY WENT MORE TO THE SCIENCE OF

00:56:36.659 --> 00:56:40.096
HOW STRESSED WATER SYSTEMS IN

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:41.498
DROUGHT.

00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:43.133
PRODUCE MORE POLLUTANTS.

00:56:43.199 --> 00:56:44.434
THAT BECOME A HIGHER PERCENTAGE

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:47.437
OF LESS WATER IN MAKE PREVIOUSLY

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:48.805
DRINKABLE WATER.

00:56:48.872 --> 00:56:51.341
UNDRINKABLE THE CLEAR NEXUS TO

00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:52.709
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:54.677
IN OKAY SO THAT I DO ASK THAT

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:56.446
ANYMORE QUESTIONS IN FUNDING BE

00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:58.615
ASKED BE ANSWERING YOUR CLOTHES

00:56:58.681 --> 00:57:00.517
THIS IS THREE TIMES THE SAME

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.018
ANSWER.

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:03.486
AND THAT'S OKAY BUT WE NEED TO

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:04.788
GET ON TO OTHER PEOPLE HAVE

00:57:04.854 --> 00:57:06.422
QUESTIONS.

00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:09.025
I BELIEVE -- LET'S SEE WE'VE

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:11.427
HEARD FROM YOU AND YOU SO THE

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:12.996
NEXT IS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:16.266
GARCIA.

THANK YOU AND I AND THEN

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:18.735
OBERNOLTE IN ARAMBULA JUST A

00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:21.671
COMMENT AND FOR THE SAKE OF TIME

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:22.939
NO ANSWER PLEASE.

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:26.509
I NEEDED BUT YOU NOTICED YOU SET

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:30.246
THAT -- PROGRESS IS GOING TO BE

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:31.614
YOU AND WE HAVE CLEAN WATER

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:33.249
COMING OUT OF THOSE TOUGH TO

00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:35.485
THESE COMMUNITIES AND AND I DO.

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:37.854
I I DO SHARE THAT GOAL I THINK.

00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:39.222
I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:41.157
CONCERNS THAT MY COLLEAGUE AT

00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:42.292
GOOD EARLIER ABOUT NOT JUST

00:57:42.358 --> 00:57:43.593
HAVING CLEAN WATER COME UP THE

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:44.961
KEEPING THAT.

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:46.062
AS CLEAN WATER NAY AND WITH THAT

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:47.630
THAT WILL BE THE SUCCESS THAT I

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:48.932
HOPE WE'RE WORKING.

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:50.300
TOWARDS I UNDERSTAND THAT WE

00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:51.901
HAVE A SYSTEM RIGHT NOW WHERE WE

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:55.805
COULD FINALLY -- TO BAD ACTORS

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:57.507
ARE FOLKS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE.

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:59.175
BUT I THINK THE SENTIMENT IS

00:57:59.242 --> 00:57:59.976
THAT THAT THE SYSTEM HASN'T

00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:01.477
NECESSARILY BEEN WORKING THE WAY

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:02.645
IT'S SUPPOSED.

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:03.880
TO OUT THERE AND I THINK THAT

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:05.615
THAT'S WHERE WE KEEP HARPING ON

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.250
IT YOU KNOW CERTAIN INDUSTRIES

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:08.885
ARE POLLUTERS -- AND THINGS THAT

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:10.687
WE'VE HAD TIME AND OUT OF HERE

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:11.921
TO GET THE VOTES DONE AND AND

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:12.922
FIND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TO DAY IN

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.657
THE ANSWERS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:58:14.724 --> 00:58:15.425
COULD COME BACK LATER IN THE

00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:16.159
CERTAIN.

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:21.564
BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT.

00:58:21.631 --> 00:58:22.398
THIS YEAR LAST YEAR SHOWS THAT

00:58:22.465 --> 00:58:23.333
WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:24.400
APPETITE TO DO THE THINGS EITHER.

00:58:24.467 --> 00:58:25.902
AND SO -- I GET WERE OUT TODAY

00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:26.669
BUT IT DOES FEEL INCOMPLETE AND

00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:29.439
AND JUST FOR THE SAKE OF OF ON

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:31.107
THE RECORD THAT THAT.

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:32.342
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS FEEL

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:34.611
SATISFACTORY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO

00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:36.379
DELAY THE SOLUTION THAT THE WORK

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:37.680
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THAT NOW

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.148
AND I WILL BE VOTING. FOR THIS

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:42.051
BILL BUT I WOULD BE DISINGENUOUS

00:58:42.118 --> 00:58:43.786
IF I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

00:58:43.853 --> 00:58:45.455
THOSE ANSWERS ARE NOT ASSEMBLY.

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:47.290
ANSWERS THAT I FIND TO BE TRUE

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:48.091
BECAUSE THE STATUS QUO HASN'T

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:49.659
BEEN WORKING.

00:58:49.726 --> 00:58:51.060
AND WE WOULDN'T BE HERE IF I HAD

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:53.663
BEEN AND THE WILL OF THE

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:55.164
LEGISLATURE IN THE POLITICAL.

00:58:55.231 --> 00:58:56.666
THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THERE BECAUSE

00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:58.334
IF NOT HERE TODAY I DON'T KNOW

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:01.871
THAT IT'S GONNA BE HERE TOMORROW.

00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:04.540
ALL RIGHT -- MISTER MCNULTY AND

00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:05.909
THEN MISTER ARAMBULA THANK YOU

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:08.578
MISTER CHAIR I AM NOT GOING TO

00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:10.980
ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR OF ALTHOUGH I

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:11.814
DO SHARE MIKE IN MY COLLEAGUES

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.016
CONCERNS ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:14.384
FUNDING AND I FRANKLY AM

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:16.185
STRUGGLING WITH.

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:17.053
WHETHER OR NOT THAT MERITS A

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.721
VOTE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:21.024
BECAUSE YOUR SERVING.

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:24.560
A VERY DIRE NEED IN CALIFORNIA --

00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:25.862
SO THE SOMETHING I'M THINKING

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:27.330
ABOUT I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:29.265
AN UNRELATED SECTION OF THE BILL

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:30.333
WHICH IS SECTION.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.668
SEVEN AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:59:31.734 --> 00:59:32.902
I'M PUZZLED BY BECAUSE IT

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:34.671
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HAVE ANYTHING

00:59:34.737 --> 00:59:36.039
TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE BILL.

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:37.507
SO CURRENT STATE LAW SAYS THAT

00:59:37.573 --> 00:59:38.775
IF YOU'RE GOING TO START A NEW

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:40.276
PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM.

00:59:40.343 --> 00:59:41.311
THE STATE BOARD.

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:42.845
CAN DENY YOUR APPLICATION BUT

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:44.514
ONLY IF THERE'S A FINDING THAT

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:45.615
YOU'RE UNABLE TO FULFILL YOUR

00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:46.549
MISSION EITHER FOR FINANCIAL

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:49.118
REASONS OR FOR LACK OF ACCESS.

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:51.220
TO A SAFE DRINKING WATER -- THIS

00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:53.723
BILLS PROPOSING TO REMOVE THAT

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:55.191
REQUIREMENT AND LET THEM TO DIET

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:56.793
WITHOUT CAUSE FOR ANY REASON I'M

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:58.828
WONDERING WHAT THAT HAS TO DO

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:00.396
WITH WHAT THE REST OF THE BILL'S

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:02.799
ACCOMPLISHING THIS.

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:05.001
THANK YOU I'M GONNA CHECK THAT

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:08.705
TO OUR WITNESS HELD OUT A LACK.

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:09.839
OF THE MY BEST SITTING THAT. ONE

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:10.473
OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.441
TO ADDRESS IS THAT SMALL WATER

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:11.908
SYSTEMS JUST SIMPLY.

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.543
AREN'T SUSTAINABLE EITHER FROM A

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:16.212
LOT OF QUALITIES PERSPECTIVE OR

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.447
TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT MANAGERIAL

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:19.148
AND FINANCIAL CAPACITY.

01:00:19.215 --> 01:00:21.884
IN THE PROLIFERATION OF SMALL

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:22.418
SYSTEMS.

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:24.220
IT IS IS JUST EXACERBATES THIS

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.488
ISSUE OVER THE OVER THE LONG

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.323
TERM ESPECIALLY AND WE'RE LEFT

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:28.491
WITH THE FINANCIAL BURDEN AS A

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:29.859
STATE AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:30.460
THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:31.661
WITH TODAY.

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.363
AND IF WE COULD STEM OF THAT

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:34.797
KIND OF THAT THE PROLIFERATION

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:36.899
STEM THAT TRENDTHEN WILL BE

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:37.633
BETTER OFF ON KIND OF ON THE

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.369
MEDIUM AND LONG TERM KIND OF

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:40.937
FINANCIAL PATH.

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:43.239
THE THE BILL DOES.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.008
REQUIRE THAT IF THAT THE THE

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:47.510
BOARD FINDS THAT THERE'S ACCESS

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:48.878
TO A NEARBY WATER SYSTEM.

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:50.780
SO THE THE THE IDEA IS IF

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:52.415
THERE'S A NEARBY WATER SYSTEM

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:53.216
THAT'S A MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:55.718
MECHANISM OF SECURING WATER TO

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:58.087
THAT NEW COMMUNITY IN A NEW AREA.

01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:00.323
SO IT IS IT THERE THERE ARE

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:01.858
CONDITIONS ATTACHED AND IT'S ALL

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:02.959
KIND OF IN THE SERVICE OF

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:06.662
CREATING A MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:07.163
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.664
CALIFORNIA.

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:10.166
I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE I

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:11.267
REPRESENT A VERY RURAL AREA THE

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:12.802
STATE ARE THE SECOND LARGEST

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.437
DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.539
AND MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:18.374
DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF HOPE

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:19.842
AGAIN TO AN EXISTING MUNICIPAL

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.511
WATER SYSTEM AND A LOT OF TIMES

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:22.111
WHEN WE HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:23.846
ABOUT.

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:25.948
ABOUT WATER SYSTEMS I THINK THAT

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:28.151
RURAL CALIFORNIA IT GETS LOST IN

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:30.119
THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:31.954
THAT REPRESENT URBAN AREAS I

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.089
DON'T THINK THAT.

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:34.357
THIS FEASIBLE FOR EVERYBODY SO

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:35.391
IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A LITTLE

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:36.993
DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF OF

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.795
MY DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE BUT

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.163
SOMETIMES THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE

01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:41.697
IS EITHER HAVE EVERYONE ON THEIR

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:43.633
OWN WHILE OR YOU INCORPORATE A

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:45.134
SMALL MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEM OR

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.702
MAYBE THIRTY PROPERTIES.

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.504
SHARE ACCESS TO A SINGLE WELL

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:49.305
AND THERE'S A SETTLEMENT TO PAY

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.640
FOR THAT AND SO I'M CONCERNED

01:01:50.706 --> 01:01:52.008
THAT MAYBE THIS IS CLOSING THE

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:53.509
DOOR ON THAT AND WE'VE BEEN

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:54.544
THROUGH THE DOWN THIS ROAD

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:55.812
BEFORE A FEW YEARS AGO WE'RE

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:57.180
TALKING ABOUT HOLD WATER.

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:58.648
AND AGAIN THE PERCEPTION IS THAT

01:01:58.714 --> 01:02:01.084
HOLD WATER IS NOT GOOD FOR

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:02.552
PROVIDING SAFE -- AND HEALTHY

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:04.053
DRINKING WATER TO CALIFORNIANS

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.489
BUT THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.356
A LOT OF THESE REGULATIONS THAT

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.491
WE PASSED IS THAT IT MAKES

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:09.425
DEVELOPMENT.

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:10.993
MUCH LESS LIKELY MUCH MORE

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.695
EXPENSIVE AND A LOT OF THE AREAS

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:13.529
OF THE STATE THAT WE NEED IT THE

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:13.729
MOST.

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:16.766
SO ARE I DO HAVE THAT CONCERN --

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:18.901
BUT I THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:20.136
THE QUESTION IF I COULD JUST

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:21.104
BRIEFLY ADD.

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:22.705
UP THE STATE WATER BOARD IS

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:24.407
CURRENTLY DOING AN ASSESSMENT

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.042
THE WATER SYSTEMS STATEWIDE THAT

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.544
WILL INFORM THE PRIORITIZATION

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:29.645
OF HOW THIS MONEY.

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:32.348
IS ALLOCATED AND FOCUSED AND

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.917
MORE CONSOLIDATION IS ONE OF THE

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:38.721
PRIORITIES WHERE APPROPRIATE.

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:39.922
WE RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT I ALSO

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:41.657
REPRESENT A RURAL AREA SO IF

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:44.260
IT'S MORE THAN A MILE CONNECTION

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:45.394
THAT MAY NOT BE THE MOST

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.797
ECONOMICAL WAY TO GO IT DOESN'T

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:49.499
PROHIBIT.

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:52.268
DEVELOPMENT THAT MIGHT RELY UPON.

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:53.836
THE NEWLY DRILLED WELL OR

01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:56.005
CONNECTION WITH A SMALLER NUMBER

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:59.308
OF USERS BUT THERE IS GONNA BE A

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.077
PRIORITIZATION SWEARS HOUSE THIS

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:04.347
MONEY BEST INVESTED TO SERVE THE

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:04.981
MOST PEOPLE.

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:06.315
AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S JUST THAT

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:07.783
THE LANGUAGE IN CURRENT STATE

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.219
CODE SAYS THAT CONNECTION HAS TO

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:12.155
ANOTHER SYSTEM HAS TO BE

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.256
FEASIBLE.

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:14.257
AND THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:16.859
WHAT FEASIBLE MEANS SO THIS

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:17.994
FEASIBLE ME IN.

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.061
AND OUT LIKE IT WAS FEASIBLE TO

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:20.062
SEND SOMEONE TO THE MOON LIKE

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:21.864
THAT KIND OF FEASIBLE AS FEES

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:23.199
WILL MEAN THAT IT'S NEXT DOOR --

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:25.401
AND I JUST BY BY GRANTING THE

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:26.802
WATER BOARD.

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.204
CARD WASH TO DENY THESE

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:29.305
APPLICATIONS I FEEL LIKE WE'RE

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:30.940
GIVING UP LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:33.276
OVER THE BOARD AND THAT'S WHY I

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:33.776
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IT.

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:37.380
THANK YOU.

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:37.947
I ALWAYS WANT TO GIVE FULL

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:40.483
CREDIT TO MISTER OBERNOLTE FOR

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.717
THOROUGHLY READING THE BELL AND

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:43.352
BRINGING UP THESE ISSUES AND

01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:45.221
CERTAINLY -- THIS IS SOMETHING

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:47.323
I'D BE GLAD TO TALK ABOUT NEXT

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.392
YEAR AND AGAIN I'M WAITED READY

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.027
TO HAVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS.

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:52.295
ARE WHENEVER THIS PROGRAM IS

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:54.664
SUFFICIENTLY OFF THE GROUND AND

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:00.776
ISSUE AND ALSO I'VE LEARNED

01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:01.777
THROUGH A COLLABORATION WITH THE

ADDRESSING THIS OPPORTUNITY.

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:18.560
IN THIS NEED WE JUST DON'T FEEL

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:20.495
THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT VEHICLE

01:18:20.562 --> 01:18:21.096
AND AS NOTED IN SOME OF OUR

01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:22.564
COMMENTS FEEL THAT THE PROCESS

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:24.066
IS JUST TOO CUMBERSOME.

01:18:24.132 --> 01:18:26.301
WHICH CAN RESULT IN UNNECESSARY

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:29.371
COSTS AND UNNECESSARY DELAY FOR

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:32.340
SO MANY COMMUNITIES OF WAITED SO

01:18:32.407 --> 01:18:34.476
LONG FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.745
PLEASE GO AHEAD.

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:37.312
THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS

JONATHAN NELSON WITH THAT

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:39.748
COMMUNITY WATER SAID ARE -- WANT

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.283
TO ECHO THE COMMENTS JUST MADE

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:42.951
THAT WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:45.387
LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR CAFIERO ON

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.254
SAFE WATER.

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:49.458
I'M AND CLEARLY WE'VE SEEN --

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:50.559
THAT WHEN WE COME TOGETHER WE

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:52.060
CAN MAKE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS SO

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:53.595
IN THAT SPIRIT WHILE WE DO HAVE

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:54.763
A CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.531
ABOUT THIS BUT WE WILL ALSO

01:18:56.598 --> 01:18:58.900
CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER -- AND

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:01.336
THE DAY THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:03.071
AGAIN IS THAT THIS.

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:04.940
I WHILE THE INTENT IS RIGHT THE

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:07.075
PROPOSAL IS A LITTLE TOO COMPLEX

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:08.743
AND CUMBERSOME WERE WORRIED THAT

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.045
WERE GOING TO CREATE A TOOL.

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:11.346
ON THAT GOES IN THE TOOLBOX BUT

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:12.581
THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET USED

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:14.783
AND WE HAVE TO CREATE A TOOL

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:15.984
THAT'S GONNA BE USED.

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:17.219
BECAUSE THERE ARE COMMUNITIES

01:19:17.285 --> 01:19:18.353
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BENEFIT

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.255
ROM THIS TYPE OF CONCEPT SO WE

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:22.991
LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU --

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:27.496
AND TO GET THIS RIGHT BECAUSE WE

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:29.831
NEED TO THANK YOU.

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:30.966
THANK YOU ARM.

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:35.570
OTHERS IN OPPOSITION -- JUST

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:37.873
STAY THERE ARE WHAT THEY MAY BE

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:40.142
QUESTIONS -- MARCH ASSEMBLY

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:41.676
MEMBER MURATSUCHI AND THEN

01:19:41.743 --> 01:19:43.111
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BECKER.

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:45.347
POWER QUE HAND AND THEN ANYONE

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:48.917
AND THEN THE MADAM VICE CHAIR.

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:50.919
SO I I I I HEAR THE OPPOSITION

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:51.453
SAYING THERE YOU WANT TO

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.554
CONTINUE TO WORK.

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:53.755
OF AB BUT YOU KNOW I I KNOW A

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:55.624
LOT OF TIMES.

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:56.791
IF SOMETHING IS PASSED THEN

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:59.427
PEOPLE SAY WELL WHY DO WE NEED

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:00.428
TO DO IS WE WE ARE RATED PAT

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:02.130
WITH DID SOMETHING LAST YEAR.

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:05.467
AND AND SO NOW I AYE CAN YOU

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:07.702
GIVE US A YOUR YOUR BEST

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:09.804
EXAMPLES OF OF YOU KNOW.

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:13.341
WHY YOU THINK THAT THIS MAY BE A

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:13.942
TO COVER SOME -- TO TO MAKE A

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:16.811
DIFFERENCE.

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:21.116
SURE THE WE BELIEVE IT THE

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:21.883
SPONSORS MENTION THAT THE STATE

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:22.951
BOARD DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:24.786
TOOLS WE THINK THAT THE STATE

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:26.054
BOARD THROUGH ESPECIALLY.

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:27.989
INTO MINISTRY OF A STORY WHICH

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:29.991
IS ACTUALLY -- SOMEWHAT IMPROVED

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:32.928
THROUGH SB -- TWO HUNDRED

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:33.628
THROUGH THROUGH THE

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:35.030
ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY AND

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:36.131
THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:39.534
IMPACTED COMMUNITIES CAN CREATE --

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:42.204
THIS THIS ENTITY -- AND THAT

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:44.606
THAT MAY BE A BETTER MECHANISM

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.007
FOR DOING SO AND THAT THE THE

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:47.609
TOOLS CURRENTLY EXIST AND WE

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.010
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE

01:20:49.077 --> 01:20:50.645
STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION.

01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:51.546
OF THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:53.114
DRINKING WATER FUND WE ARE

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:54.749
INSURING IN CREATING THE

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:56.284
OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS CLEAN

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.552
DRINKING WATER AND THE BEST WAY

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.187
POSSIBLE FOR EACH COMMUNITY --

01:20:59.254 --> 01:21:00.922
WE ALL KIND OF AGREE THAT

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:02.490
THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL SO

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:03.592
I THINK ONE KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL

01:21:03.658 --> 01:21:05.493
DISAGREEMENT AS WE THINK THAT

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.462
THERE ARE SUFFICIENT TOOLS AND

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.331
STATE LAW AND THE ISSUE IS

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:11.566
MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE USED.

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:13.368
CORRECTLY CAN A WITH THIS WITH

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:14.803
COME INPUT FROM ALL OF US BUT

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:15.770
ESPECIALLY THE SPONSORS WITHOUT

01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:16.871
SO MUCH ABOUT THIS.

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:19.274
THERE'S A LOT OF LOCAL

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:21.243
GOVERNMENT PROCESS THERE'S A LOT --

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:23.178
IT'S A BIT OF A GAME OF CHUTES

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:28.650
AND LADDERS TO BORROW A TERM

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:28.850
FROM.

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:32.053
AN COULD COLLEAGUES IN DRINKING

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.488
WATER THAT WORK TO COMMITTEE

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:34.789
WATER CENTER FOR MANY YEARS.

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:37.025
THAT THERE'S THE COMMUNITY COULD

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:39.561
BE KIND OF IN GROUP IN WITH A

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.162
REGIONAL CONSOLIDATION AND THEN

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:42.864
YEARS DOWN THE LINE IT COULD

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:43.465
THERE COULD BE A DETERMINATION

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:43.965
THAT THAT.

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:44.833
CAN REGIONAL ENTITY IS NOT

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:47.168
SUSTAINABLE OVER THE LONG TERM

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:49.437
AND THE AND THE THE PROGRAMMER

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:53.108
PROCESS IS -- ABANDONED AND ARE

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:54.175
BACK TO SQUARE ONE SO I WHAT

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.477
WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS TO ENSURE

01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:56.344
THAT THERE'S A PRODUCT OF THEIR

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:58.647
A ROBUST PROCESS OUT THE AT AT

01:21:58.713 --> 01:21:58.947
THE OUTSET.

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:00.749
WERE DOING FEASIBILITY USING THE

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.217
STATE BOARDS TOOLS CURRENTLY TO

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:03.485
DO SO VISIBILITY ANALYSIS AND

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:04.886
MAKE SURE THAT THE TOOL THAT

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.521
WERE CHOOSING FROM THE OUTSET.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:08.223
IS GOING TO BE THE SOLUTION FOR

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:10.525
THAT COMMUNITY IN THAT REGION.

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:11.159
AND AND SO WHY DO YOU THINK THE

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:11.860
THE CARD.

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:14.195
IS SO EAGER SEND THAT SB TWO

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:16.965
HUNDRED MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:20.001
TOOLS. TO TO TO MOVE IN THE

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:20.635
RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IN THE THE

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:22.270
COMBINATION OF SB TWO HUNDRED

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:23.972
AND AND KIND OF COORDINATION

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:25.573
WITH LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.642
PASSED COME IN PAST YEARS

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:28.810
THERE'S YOU KNOW SB EIGHTY EIGHT

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:29.144
WAS.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:31.313
IS THE MANDATORY AUTHORITY FOR

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:32.447
REGIONAL AND FISCAL

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:35.317
CONSOLIDATION ALONG WITH SB FIVE

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:35.884
FIVE TWO WHICH WAS ALSO WILK

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.919
BILL THAT ALLOWED FOR

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:40.121
ADMINISTRATORS -- AUTHORITY IN

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:43.158
ADMINISTRATOR IN A TO GET NEW

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:43.992
TOO MUCH TO THE WEEDS BUT AN

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:47.329
ADMINISTRATOR COULD FOR EXAMPLE --

01:22:47.395 --> 01:22:48.396
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:50.031
MANAGERIAL SUPPORT FOR SEVERAL

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:52.701
SYSTEMS AND IT MIGHT BE AND WE

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:53.702
CAN ENVISION THAT THAT

01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:56.938
ADMINISTRATOR THAT THAT THE THAT

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:59.174
ADMINISTRATORS A CUSTODIAN TO

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.375
GET THE COULD SYSTEMS BACK IN.

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:02.010
PLACE AND THEN THAT CONVERTS

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:04.346
INTO A REGIONAL AUTHORITY FOR

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:05.880
EXAMPLE WITH THE STATE'S

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:07.782
EXISTING TOOLS THAT THERE BE A

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:08.316
CONSOLIDATION AMONG THOSE

01:23:08.383 --> 01:23:11.519
SYSTEMS -- AND WITH OUT KIND OF

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.722
THE PROCESS THAT NOW AGAIN THAT

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:16.057
WE FEEL IS. TOO CUMBERSOME

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:18.326
CURRENTLY AND FOUR ONE FOUR AND

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:22.330

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:13.515
DOES IS IT GIVES A MEDIC.

01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:14.616
FORTY UP BUT THEY HAVE TO GO

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:15.750
THROUGH A LAUGH CALL LIKE

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:18.319
PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES PUBLIC

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:19.154
HEARINGS -- PUBLIC KNOWS IT

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.656
PUBLIC NOTICE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:25.460
MAKE COMMENTS -- THERE THEY ARE

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.629
THERE IS ALSO A REQUIREMENT THAT

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:29.931
THEY HAVE AN AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:31.733
VOTE FOR REPRESENTATIVES THAT

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.201
WOULD BE ON THE BOARD.

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:34.702
AS PART OF THIS CONSOLIDATED

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.004
SYSTEM SO RIGHT NOW THEY THEY

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.605
MAY HAVE NO BOARD MEMBERS BUT IF

01:24:37.672 --> 01:24:39.274
THE CONSOLIDATED THEY CAN BE

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.209
FORCED TO HAVE -- UP

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:43.044
PARTICIPATION AND SO ON IF THERE

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:45.713
THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE USUALLY

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.816
IDENTIFIED AS IMPORTANT TO COULD

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:49.350
TO PROTECT CONSUMERS -- THE

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:50.819
OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD AND HAVE

01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:52.153
MEETINGS AND TO BE ABLE TO

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.655
UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT IS BEING

01:24:53.721 --> 01:24:57.358
PLANNED AND SO -- IT'S IT IT IS

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:58.960
CUMBERSOME BECAUSE THE PUBLIC

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:00.361
PROCESS IS CUMBERSOME I MEAN THE

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:02.530
RULES THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:03.598
UNDER THAT.

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:05.867
THE BROWN ACT ARE -- FRANKLY

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.169
MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENT PEOPLE SAY

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:10.038
OUR PAIN RIGHT BUT THEY IT IT'S

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:11.940
WHAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC AND SO --

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:13.241
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:14.876
CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:16.478
WATER BOARD TO MAKE A DECISION

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:18.046
ABOUT WHAT MAY BE IN THE BEST

01:25:18.112 --> 01:25:19.447
INTEREST OF THOSE PARTICULAR

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:20.415
RESIDENTS?

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:22.150
BUT THEN IT'S IT'S A PROCESS

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:23.785
THAT THAT THAT ON THE LEFT THOSE

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:26.321
HAVE TO GO THROUGH AS PART OF

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:28.056
THAT AS PART OF THE OF MAKING IT

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:29.257
HAPPEN.

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.759
AND AND AND FRANKLY I AM IT'S MY

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:33.728
MY BELIEF THAT THOSE THOSE

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.296
PROCESSES ARE ARE TO PROTECT

01:25:35.363 --> 01:25:37.499
THAT THE RATE PAYERS AND THE

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:39.300
CONSUMERS -- AND AND IF I COULD

01:25:39.367 --> 01:25:45.473
I THINK THAT THE ISSUE HERE IS

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:46.975
THAT WE SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:47.809
LAST AND IT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:48.376
WORK AND THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:25:48.443 --> 01:25:49.010
FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE AND IT'S

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:49.978
THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:51.279
PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE.

01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:55.517
OUGHT TO BE CONSOLIDATED -- IT

01:25:55.583 --> 01:25:56.951
IS NOT A MANDATORY SYSTEM.

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:59.287
IT IS A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX AND

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:01.956
THE WATER BOARD COULD DECIDE TO

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.825
DO SOME OTHER PROCESS -- AND

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:05.527
PART QUITE FRANKLY THAT THE THE

01:26:05.593 --> 01:26:07.128
RATE PAYERS MAY DECIDE THEY

01:26:07.195 --> 01:26:08.530
DON'T WANT TO BE CONSOLIDATED AS

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:10.198
PART OF AT THE SAID THE SYSTEMS

01:26:10.265 --> 01:26:12.500
BUT IT LEAVES THAT IT LEAVES IT

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:14.969
UP TO A PUBLIC AND PROCESS DID

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:16.204
TO MAKE THAT DECISION SO.

01:26:16.271 --> 01:26:17.972
SO IS IT CUMBERSOME YES IS IT

01:26:18.039 --> 01:26:20.174
GOING TO COST MONEY YES IT IS

01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:21.609
BECAUSE ANYTIME YOU'RE GOING AND

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:23.244
YOU'RE DOING A TAKEOVER.

01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:26.014
OF OF A SYSTEM -- YOU GOT TO

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.715
MAKE SURE YOU'RE PROTECTING --

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:28.383
ALL THE CURRENT RATE PAYERS AND

01:26:28.449 --> 01:26:29.717
ANYBODY ELSE THAT WOULD BE

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:33.655
CONSOLIDATED PART OF THE SYSTEM

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:35.723
IS MY SECOND GORON READ WE NOW I

THIS KIND OF CONSOLIDATION

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.115
POSSIBLE FEASIBLE.

01:27:01.182 --> 01:27:03.351

01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:55.096
ASSEMBLY MIGHT ACTUALLY THERE

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.764
IT'S OUR RUSSIAN JUST ASK MAYBE

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:57.398
EXCEPT SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

01:28:57.465 --> 01:28:57.932
THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:59.100
ESTIMATED ABOUT FIFTY MILLION

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:03.004
DOLLARS FOR THIS PROCESS TO HAVE

01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:04.839
THAT RIGHT.

01:29:04.906 --> 01:29:06.507
I'M NOT I I DON'T REMEMBER THAT

01:29:06.574 --> 01:29:08.443
OKAY THE TRUTH ANYBODY I CAN I

01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:10.545
CAN TELL YOU THAT WE HAD SOME

01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:12.313
NUMBERS FROM THE STATE WATER

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.615
BOARD AS IT RELATES TO AB TWENTY

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:15.383
FIFTY BUT WE'VE MADE SOME

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:17.018
IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:18.519
THINK WOULD REDUCE THOSE COSTS

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:19.787
SO WE FEEL AS THOUGH.

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:20.822
THE COSTS THAT WERE IN THE

01:29:20.888 --> 01:29:22.657
LATEST APPROPRIATIONS ANALYSIS

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:25.059
WERE WERE MORE THAN WHAT THE

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:25.626
BILL WOULD ACTUALLY COST TO

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:26.694
IMPLEMENT.

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:28.896
OKAY SO I GUESS YOU KNOW I GOING

01:29:28.963 --> 01:29:32.166
BACK AS YOU MENTIONED SB TWO

01:29:32.233 --> 01:29:33.735
HUNDRED INCLUDES IN AT THE

01:29:33.801 --> 01:29:34.402
ABILITY TO USE THESE TO YOUR OF

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:36.370
FUNDS FOR THESE CONSOLIDATIONS

01:29:36.437 --> 01:29:38.306
WE JUST APPROVED WE JUST MOVE

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:39.474
THAT BILL WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:40.374
UP TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:41.409
MILLION DOLLARS TO GET.

01:29:41.476 --> 01:29:42.643
CALIFORNIANS TO CLEAN DRINKING

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.378
WATER IF THIS IS FIFTY MILLION

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:45.880
DOLLARS OF THAT HUNDRED AND

01:29:45.947 --> 01:29:47.582
THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:49.383
TAKEN OUT FOR A CUMBERSOME

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:52.887
BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS.

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:54.355
BECAUSE I DON'T HALF THE MONEY.

01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:56.224
GOING TO THIS CONSOLIDATION

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:57.625
PROCESS INSTEAD OF GETTING.

01:29:57.692 --> 01:29:58.926
OUR CONSTITUENTS TO CLEAN

01:29:58.993 --> 01:30:00.595
DRINKING WATER CAN YOU SPEAK TO

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:02.363
THAT SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:06.067
AND I CAN I CAN TURN IT OVER --

01:30:06.134 --> 01:30:06.868
I THINK IT IS.

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:10.938
IN ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THE SB

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:12.373
TWO HUNDRED MANY WOULD FIND THIS.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.608
THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE A

01:30:13.674 --> 01:30:16.144
COMBINATION OF OF FUNDS THAT

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:18.946
COME FROM -- BECAUSE THAT THE

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:20.748
CONSOLIDATION IS ONE THING.

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:22.450
RIGHT WHICH IS THE PROCESS FOR

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:24.852
GETTING ALL OF THEM ON A ON ONE

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:26.254
MANAGERIAL SYSTEM IN TECH

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.555
TECHNICAL SYSTEM.

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:28.790
AND THEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:30.458
FIXING.

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:32.794
THAT SYSTEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.129
PROVIDING CONTAMINATED WATER AND

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:36.597
THAT'S THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:30:36.664 --> 01:30:38.499
THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED OUT AND

01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:41.803
IT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED AND SO --

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:43.437
AT SO YOU HAVE TO DISTINGUISH

01:30:43.504 --> 01:30:45.606
BETWEEN THE TWO AND IT'S MY

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:47.809
BELIEF IS AYE RICK RECALLED THE

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:51.979
BOND FUNDING -- WAS.

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:54.315
FOR CONSOLIDATION BUT MAG MAY

01:30:54.382 --> 01:30:56.851
HAVE IT BACKWARDS IN THE SB TWO

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:58.920
HUNDRED IS MORE FOR THE

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:02.523
INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND SO SO

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:06.327
WHATEVER THE AMOUNT IS.

01:31:06.394 --> 01:31:07.795
SO LET ME BACK UP AND JUST SAY

01:31:07.862 --> 01:31:09.463
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A CURRENT

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.165
SITUATION.

01:31:11.232 --> 01:31:12.433
WHERE THERE ARE THERE'S NO

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:16.003
MECHANISM? TO FORCE THE

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:17.471
CONSOLIDATION [inaudible]

01:31:17.538 --> 01:31:19.507
OF THESE.

01:31:19.574 --> 01:31:21.509
SYSTEMS BETTER PROVIDING

01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:23.444
CONTAMINATED WATER.

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:25.646
THERE IS NO MECHANISM.

01:31:25.713 --> 01:31:27.882
THIS IS A POTENTIAL MECHANISM

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:29.684
AND WE WORKED REALLY HARD AT

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.686
CREATING A SYSTEM.

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:34.021
THE TREATS THE PEOPLE.

01:31:34.088 --> 01:31:35.423
DEREK CURRENTLY RECEIVING

01:31:35.489 --> 01:31:38.492
CONTAMINATED WATER WITH RESPECT.

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:40.461
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO

01:31:40.528 --> 01:31:42.597
BE INVOLVED IN A PROCESS IT'S

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:43.197
GOING TO TAKE OVER THEIR WATER

01:31:43.264 --> 01:31:44.565
SYSTEM.

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:46.033
AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:47.001
UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S GOING TO

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:49.904
HAPPEN TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE

01:31:49.971 --> 01:31:51.505
IN A PUBLIC PROCESS.

01:31:51.572 --> 01:31:54.976
AND TO BE ABLE TO THEN -- BE

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:57.845
ENGAGED SO THAT THEY CAN ELECT.

01:31:57.912 --> 01:31:59.046
BOARD MEMBERS.

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:00.681
THAT'S WHAT'S CUMBERSOME.

01:32:00.748 --> 01:32:02.416
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S THE RIGHT

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:05.653
THING TO DO SO I DON'T I DON'T

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.655
AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS THAT

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:09.757
IT'S CUMBERSOME I JUST I THINK

01:32:09.824 --> 01:32:11.726
IT'S PART OF A POLITICAL PROCESS

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:12.026
[inaudible]

01:32:12.093 --> 01:32:15.329
BUT BUT IT PROVIDES THEM AND

01:32:15.396 --> 01:32:16.831
TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT SO THAT

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:17.798
THEY CAN GET THEIR SYSTEM

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:19.333
CLEANED UP SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:20.268
PIECE.

01:32:20.334 --> 01:32:22.470
IN TERMS OF THE FINANCING OUT OF

01:32:22.536 --> 01:32:24.272
I AM I PROBABLY GOT IT ALL

01:32:24.338 --> 01:32:26.507
PULLED UP SO WE CAN JUST GO BACK

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:28.175
HAS.

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:28.709
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:29.310
ESSENTIALLY ALLOCATING THOSE

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:31.145
RESOURCES OVER FOUR YEARS SO WE

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.113
ENVISION A LARGE?

01:32:32.179 --> 01:32:33.481
THAT PORTION THAT YOU'VE

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:35.650
IDENTIFIED OVER FOUR YEARS SO

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:36.951
IT'S NOT GONNA BE A ONE TIME.

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:38.452
FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:39.987
FROM THE HUNDRED THIRTY OR

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:41.889
WHATEVER FUNDING SOURCES OUT

01:32:41.956 --> 01:32:43.291
THERE IT'S GOING TO BE.

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:45.059
ALLOCATED OVER FOUR YEARS AS

01:32:45.126 --> 01:32:46.894
THIS PROCESS AND ROLLS.

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:48.462
AND ROLLS AND WHAT I ALLUDED TO

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:50.498
IN MY TESTIMONY IS THAT WE

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:52.066
AREN'T JUST LOOKING AT A

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:54.268
REGIONAL ALLIES A SITUATION

01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:55.136
WE'RE LOOKING TO REGION LIES OF

01:32:55.202 --> 01:32:56.304
WATER DISTRICTS.

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:57.271
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE UNDERLYING

01:32:57.338 --> 01:33:00.174
GOVERNANCE WERE ACTUALLY FORMING

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:02.143
NEW WATER SYSTEMS IT'S A NEW

01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:05.112
SYSTEM IN THE GUT AND AM.

01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:06.480
I KNEW PRINCIPLE ACT SO WHAT THE

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:08.849
BILL DOES IT ESTABLISHES ALL THE

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.418
POWERS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:12.853
THE SYSTEMS TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.488
WE'VE IT AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:15.456
SPECIAL DISTRICTS WE'VE HAD

01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:17.591
OUTLINED ALL THE TRANSPARENCY

01:33:17.658 --> 01:33:19.460
MECHANISMS THAT ARE NECESSARY WE

01:33:19.527 --> 01:33:21.462
HAD TO OUTLINE ALL THE ABILITIES

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:22.997
THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH.

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:23.698
AND THIS IS DONE THROUGH

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:25.733
MULTIPLE ACTS BECAUSE WE ARE

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.969
LOOKING AT CPUC REGULATED WATER

01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:29.670
SYSTEMS WERE LOOKING OUT PUBLIC

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:31.372
WATER SYSTEMS ARE ALSO LOOKING

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:32.640
AT MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES.

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:34.108
SO WE'RE TAKING ALL THOSE

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:36.410
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS TYPES

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:37.979
DISSOLVING THEM AND THEN FORMING

01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:39.580
THEM INTO A NEW SYSTEM THROUGH A

01:33:39.647 --> 01:33:41.315
NEW PRINCIPAL ACT SO IT WELL IT

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.583
APPEARS CUMBERSOME.

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:45.353
IS ACTUALLY A ROAD MAP THAT

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:46.787
PROVIDES VERY.

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:54.595
DEFINED STEP BY STEP ACTIONS.

01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:55.396
AND I'M SORRY IF I MAY ADD WE

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:56.931
DON'T HAVE TO ENVISION A FUTURE

01:33:56.998 --> 01:33:58.332
WHERE SOME SIT.

01:33:58.399 --> 01:33:58.866
FOR THESE DIFFERENT WATER

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:00.768
SYSTEMS EVENTUALLY JOINED.

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:01.802
WHERE IT PROVIDING A FUTURE

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:04.005
WHERE THE SYSTEMS ARE TOO LARGE

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:08.309
AND VIABLE AND TRANSPARENT?

01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:09.110

INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SUFFERING

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:16.717
FROM THIS CLEAN WATER PROBLEM

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:19.520

USING TEACHER OF MONEY. TO GET

01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:30.431

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:31.665
ON SB TWO HUNDRED ABSOLUTELY

BUT TO THE STATE WATER BOARD TO

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:37.738
FIND THE FOLLOWING CONSOLIDATED

01:34:37.805 --> 01:34:39.273
WATER SYSTEMS TO FIND THIS

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.675
PROCESS SO AGAIN WE'RE TALKING

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:42.743
ABOUT USING DID YOUR OF FUNDS

01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:43.277

THE MOST IS IT'S MY

01:35:13.307 --> 01:35:15.109
UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE --

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:17.311
SMALL WATER AUTHORITIES COULD

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:19.213
ISSUE BONDS WITHOUT VOTER

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.981
APPROVAL [inaudible]

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:23.017
WHY?

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:24.151
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:29.657
CONSOLIDATED YES SYSTEMS.

01:35:29.723 --> 01:35:31.859
YEAH THE BILL ENABLES THESE

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:35.096
SYSTEMS TO PASS REVENUE BONDS

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:37.031
AND THAT IS A METHOD I KNOW WHAT

01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:39.800
A REVENUE BOND IS WIRE WHEEL

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:41.235
AGAIN IF YOU COULD JUST ANSWER.

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:44.138
OKAY IT'S A METHOD OF FINANCING --

01:35:44.205 --> 01:35:45.673
THAT IS WIDELY USED THROUGHOUT

01:35:45.739 --> 01:35:47.007
THE WATER AND WASTEWATER

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:49.076
INDUSTRIES.

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:51.779
AND DO YOU HAVE AN POWER THESE

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:52.680
DISTRICTS TO UTILIZE.

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:53.914
ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX TO

01:35:53.981 --> 01:35:57.751
ENSURE THERE IS THE ABILITY.

01:35:57.818 --> 01:35:59.253
TO PROVIDE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.155
THE MOST TIMELY AND SENSITIVE

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:03.757
MANNER BY BY PASSING THE VOTERS.

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:05.559
THERE WE ARE SPEAKING OF A VERY

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:06.894
DEFINED AND SMALL UNIVERSE THAT

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:08.729
ARE ABLE TO UTILIZE ALL THE TOOL

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:10.564
BOXES ARE ALL THE TOOLS IN THE

01:36:10.631 --> 01:36:12.666
TOOLBOX THAT CURRENT WATER

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:14.135
AGENCIES UTILIZE.

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:16.137
WE HAVE OVERSIGHT BUILT INTO THE

01:36:16.203 --> 01:36:18.639
BILL BY THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S

01:36:18.706 --> 01:36:20.474
OFFICE BY THE LAUGH GO.

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:21.675
BY ALL THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:23.711
TO ENSURE AND AS WAS IDENTIFIED

01:36:23.777 --> 01:36:24.912
IN THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:27.114
FINANCE HEARING ON AB.

01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:27.781
TWENTY FIFTY AT THIS TIME THERE

01:36:27.848 --> 01:36:29.917
IS NO KNOWN DEFAULT ON A REVENUE

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.118
BOND.

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:33.654
BUY PULP SO AGAIN I GO BACK.

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:34.955
TO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING

01:36:35.022 --> 01:36:37.091
AS LONG AS THE UNIVERSE IS VERY

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:39.593
VERY SMALL IT'S OKAY TO NOT GO

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:41.295
THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS AND

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:42.997
OKAY TO BY PASS THE VOTERS WHICH

01:36:43.063 --> 01:36:44.298
IS NOT THE NORM.

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:45.566
IN ANY OTHER CASE WHEN YOU'RE

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:47.034
ISSUING BONDS AT THE VOTERS HAVE

01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:48.602
A CHOICE THAT VOTERS WOULD HAVE

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:51.906
AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLAW THAT BACK

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:53.474
BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT

01:36:53.541 --> 01:36:55.009
WITH THE REFERENDUM WHICH I

01:36:55.075 --> 01:36:56.310
THINK IS BACKWARDS IN IS NOT

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:58.045
RESPECTFUL. TO THE PEOPLE THAT

01:36:58.112 --> 01:36:59.079
YOU'RE TRYING TO SERVE TO WHAT

01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:01.715
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS WONDERFUL

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:03.551
IT'S JUST THIS PARTICULAR PART

01:37:03.617 --> 01:37:04.919
WHERE YOU'RE SAYING BASICALLY

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:06.954
IT'S JUST GONNA BE EASIER FOR US

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:08.789
TO DO THIS IF WE JUST DON'T

01:37:08.856 --> 01:37:10.424
ALLOW THE VOTERS TO WAY AND I

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:12.193
THINK THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE.

01:37:12.259 --> 01:37:16.964
AND I THINK IT'S AN ANSWER WRONG.

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:18.532
SOUND [inaudible]

01:37:18.599 --> 01:37:20.434
I'M.

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:21.335
ALSO I HAVE A QUESTION DON'T WE

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:22.169
ALLOW ALL THE WATER DISTRICTS TO

01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:23.504
DO THIS TO HAVE REVENUE BONDS

01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:25.472
ALL THE SEWER DISTRICTS DON'T

01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:28.509
THEY ALL HAVE THIS A TOWARD.

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:29.710
MY KNOWLEDGE THAT YEAH I MEAN

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:30.778
CERTAINLY THE CITY OF HEY WHERE

01:37:30.844 --> 01:37:34.215
DO WE DID -- REVENUE BOND -- TO

01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:35.883
DO OUR SEWER SYSTEM THAT IS PAID

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:37.218
FOR BY SEWER FEES IT'S NOT

01:37:37.284 --> 01:37:40.154
REQUIRED TO GO BEFORE THE VOTERS.

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:41.522
OF SAME WITH THE S. F. P. YOU

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:44.858
SEE WHICH AND AND OTHER AGENCIES --

01:37:44.925 --> 01:37:46.393
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO FUND THAT

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:49.663
THROUGH FEES.

01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:52.032
IT'S IT'S NORMAL HONEST ALL THE

01:37:52.099 --> 01:37:54.301
BIG WEATHER DISTRICTS DO IT

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:54.602
[inaudible]

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:57.871
OUR YOUR OBERNOLTE.

01:37:57.938 --> 01:37:59.206
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAD A

01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:01.041
QUESTION ABOUT THE METHOD ON

01:38:01.108 --> 01:38:04.812
WHICH AB FORCIBLY CONSOLIDATE

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:06.714
WATER SYSTEM IS VALUED.

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.616
SO THE BILL HAS A SECTION ON

01:38:08.682 --> 01:38:10.317
THIS AND IT SAYS THAT TO VALUE

01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:12.119
IT YOU DO A DISTRESSED BUSINESS

01:38:12.186 --> 01:38:13.554
VALUATION.

01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:15.055
WHICH ARE MOST ACCOUNTS WILL BE

01:38:15.122 --> 01:38:15.856
FAMILIAR WITH YOU TAKE ALL THE

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:17.224
ASSET YOU SUBTRACT ALL THE

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.425
LIABILITIES BUT IT'S GOT.

01:38:18.492 --> 01:38:21.028
ANOTHER PART THAT SAYS THAT YOU

01:38:21.095 --> 01:38:22.329
ALSO SUBTRACT.

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:25.399
THE COST REQUIRED TO BRING.

01:38:25.466 --> 01:38:26.500
NOT JUST THE EQUIPMENT BUT THE

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:27.968
DRINKING WATER TREATED UP TO

01:38:28.035 --> 01:38:30.237
STATE STANDARDS.

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:31.238
A ON OUR THAT CAUSED SOME

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:33.507
CONCERN FOR ME BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:34.875
AN UNREASONABLE SITUATION TO

01:38:34.942 --> 01:38:36.477
THINK OF A WATER DISTRICT THE

01:38:36.543 --> 01:38:37.544
COULDN'T AFFORD.

01:38:37.611 --> 01:38:39.880
THE EQUIPMENT REQUIRED TO TREAT

01:38:39.947 --> 01:38:41.649
THE WATER UP TO THE STATE'S

01:38:41.715 --> 01:38:42.316
STANDARDS AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:44.685
DISTRESSED IN THE FIRST PLACE IN

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:46.020
FACT I HAD A MEETING IN MY

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:47.121
DISTRICT OFFICE.

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:48.589
ON FRIDAY WITH BOARD OF

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:49.657
DIRECTORS OF A WATER DISTRICT

01:38:49.723 --> 01:38:51.158
THAT IS EXACTLY THAT SAME

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:52.926
SITUATION SO I MEAN IF YOU SAY

01:38:52.993 --> 01:38:53.527
THAT.

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:55.863
THE A A DISTRICT JUST BOUGHT A

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:56.397
MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:57.097
EQUIPMENT.

01:38:57.164 --> 01:38:59.833
BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE TEN

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.402
MILLION DOLLARS IT WOULD TAKE.

01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:03.270
FOR THE EQUIPMENT -- TO TREAT

01:39:03.337 --> 01:39:05.205
THE ACROMION REMOVE CHROMIUM SIX

01:39:05.272 --> 01:39:06.307
OR URANIUM OR SOMETHING LIKE

01:39:06.373 --> 01:39:08.542
THAT -- TO SAY THAT THEY ARE

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:10.110
WORTH NEGATIVE NINE MILLION

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:11.312
DOLLARS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME

01:39:11.378 --> 01:39:13.447
SO COULD YOU TALK A BIT ABOUT

01:39:13.514 --> 01:39:15.349
THAT METHOD EVALUATION BECAUSE

01:39:15.416 --> 01:39:18.619
I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:20.154
I GIVE IDENTIFIED THE METHOD --

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.389
CORRECTLY BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT

01:39:22.456 --> 01:39:24.758
IN ANY SCENARIO THERE'S GOING TO

01:39:24.825 --> 01:39:25.859
HAVE TO BE -- SOME ENTITY THAT'S

01:39:25.926 --> 01:39:26.660
GOING TO HAVE TO BRING THAT

01:39:26.727 --> 01:39:28.562
SYSTEM UP TO COMPLIANCE AND SO

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:32.700
SHOULD THAT SYSTEM GET VALUE.

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:34.134
FOR WHAT IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO

01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:35.336
HAVE TO OCCUR.

01:39:35.402 --> 01:39:35.903
YEAH BUT YOU'RE SEIZING HIS

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:38.772
PROPERTY.

01:39:38.839 --> 01:39:40.074
YOU'VE GOT LIKE THESE SMALL

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:40.908
MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES MIGHT

01:39:40.974 --> 01:39:42.576
HAVE THEIR OWN SHAREHOLDERS THAT

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:44.511
HAVE MADE AN INVESTMENT IN THIS.

01:39:44.578 --> 01:39:45.179
IN THIS WATER DISTRICT AND IT'S

01:39:45.245 --> 01:39:47.014
A STATE STANDARD IN MANY CASES

01:39:47.081 --> 01:39:48.982
THAT'S FORCING THE FINANCIAL

01:39:49.049 --> 01:39:49.883
DISTRESS ON THE WATER DISTRICTS

01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:51.285
ARE I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE

01:39:51.352 --> 01:39:52.920
FACT THAT YOU KNOW WE DECIDE AS

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:53.454
A STATE WHAT OUR MINIMUM

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:54.521
STANDARDS ARE.

01:39:54.588 --> 01:39:55.723
IF WE HAVE WATER DISTRICTS

01:39:55.789 --> 01:39:57.224
THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE WE CREE

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:58.759
GRANT FUNDS TO TELL THOSE WATER

01:39:58.826 --> 01:39:59.793
DISTRICT OUT THAT'S ALL WHAT

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:01.528
WE'RE DOING HERE BUT TO SAY. TO

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:02.663
THE EXISTING OWNERS OF THAT

01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:05.032
PROPERTY YOU GET NOTHING SEEMS

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:07.501
TOTALLY WRONG TO ME.

01:40:07.568 --> 01:40:08.635
WELL I UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR

01:40:08.702 --> 01:40:10.137
POSITION EXCEPT FOR THAT HAD

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:12.106
THEY TAKEN.

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:14.141
CARE OF THE PROBLEM THEN THEY

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:16.410
WOULD BE PROVIDING CONTAMINATED

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:17.478
WATER TO PEOPLE I MEAN THAT

01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:18.479
MEANS AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU

01:40:18.545 --> 01:40:19.947
THAT MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES IN

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:21.115
MY DISTRICT.

01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:22.950
THEY ARE BEING PROVIDED WITH

01:40:23.016 --> 01:40:24.985
WATER THAT THEY CANNOT USE THEY

01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:25.986
GET CHARGED.

01:40:26.053 --> 01:40:28.222
MOM AND IN A COUPLE OF THE OF

01:40:28.288 --> 01:40:29.757
THE DISTRICTS IT'S IN EXCESS OF

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:31.625
A HUNDRED DOLLARS SO THEY HAVE

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:34.161
TO PAY FOR WATER THE DATE THEN

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:35.529
CAN'T DRINKING CAN BE THEN.

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:37.464
AND AND IT'S A IT'S A MINIMUM

01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:39.833
FEE AND SO PART OF THE CHALLENGE

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.368
THAT WE HAVE IS HOW DO YOU.

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:43.270
HOW DO YOU CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:40:43.337 --> 01:40:47.875
TO BE ABLE TO INVEST RESPONSIBLY

01:40:47.941 --> 01:40:50.244
IN THOSE WATER SYSTEMS ONCE

01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.878
THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN THE POINT

01:40:50.944 --> 01:40:52.045
WHEN SHE STARTED CONSOLIDATION

01:40:52.112 --> 01:40:52.513
PROCESS?

01:40:52.579 --> 01:40:54.148
AND IS ARE THEY ENTITLED TO GET

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:56.884
PAID FOR SOMETHING -- THAT THAT

01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:59.286
IS NOT NOT MEETING STATE

01:40:59.353 --> 01:41:01.255
STANDARDS BY A LONG SHOT I THIS

01:41:01.321 --> 01:41:04.358
ISN'T EVEN CLOSE IT'S IT'S BY A

01:41:04.425 --> 01:41:06.560
LONG SHOT AND SO -- IT ACT THE

01:41:06.627 --> 01:41:07.594
PART OF THE IT'S PART OF THE

01:41:07.661 --> 01:41:08.362
REPERCUSSIONS OF IT AND AND WE

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:09.730
WE WE DID IT THAT WAY

01:41:09.797 --> 01:41:11.532
SPECIFICALLY SO THAT WE ARE WE

01:41:11.598 --> 01:41:12.933
HAD WAITED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.769
THE INVESTMENTS IN IN.

01:41:15.836 --> 01:41:16.837
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S GOING

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:19.506
TO BE NEEDED.

01:41:19.573 --> 01:41:21.842
OKAY SO LET ME PROVIDE YOU A

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:23.544
COUNTER EXAMPLE FROM MY DISTRICT --

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:25.212
I'VE WATER DISTRICT THAT HAS A

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:26.780
CHROMIUM SIX PROBLEM.

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:28.715
AND IT'S NATURALLY OCCURRING AND

01:41:28.782 --> 01:41:29.416
THEY DIDN'T USED TO HAVE A

01:41:29.483 --> 01:41:30.717
PROBLEM BECAUSE THE STATE

01:41:30.784 --> 01:41:31.752
STANDARDS WAS HIGHER DROP THAT

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:33.220
USED TO BE AND AND SO EVERY TIME

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:35.222
DETECTION TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES WE

01:41:35.289 --> 01:41:36.056
LOWER THE STATE'S STANDARDS SO

01:41:36.123 --> 01:41:36.657
WE'RE NOT LOWERED IT TO THE

01:41:36.723 --> 01:41:37.458
POINT WHERE.

01:41:37.524 --> 01:41:39.793
THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:40.394
INVESTING.

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:41.562
THIS PARTICULAR DISTRICT I THINK

01:41:41.628 --> 01:41:42.963
WE FOUND A WAY OUT FOR THEM BUT

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:44.832
ORIGINALLY LOOKED LIKE INVESTING

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:46.867
IN THE EQUIPMENT TO REMOVE THEIR

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:47.401
CHROMIUM.

01:41:47.468 --> 01:41:49.570
SIX WAS WAS GOING TO BANKRUPT

01:41:49.636 --> 01:41:50.471
THE DISTRICT THERE'S NO WAY FOR

01:41:50.537 --> 01:41:52.139
THEM TO DO IT.

01:41:52.206 --> 01:41:55.309
THE SHARES OF STOCK IN THAT

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:57.377
DISTRICT HAVE BEEN IN -- A

01:41:57.444 --> 01:41:59.880
FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS -- WAS

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:02.883
LIKE THE GRANDPA SMITH STARTED

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:03.684
YOU KNOW WHEN THE AREA WAS FIRST

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:05.252
SETTLED TO SAY AND AND THEY MADE

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:07.387
SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT -- IN THE

01:42:07.454 --> 01:42:09.957
SYSTEM SINCE THEN TO SAY TO THAT

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:10.924
FAMILY.

01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:11.492
THAT YOUR SHARES ARE WORTH

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:12.092
NOTHING BECAUSE OF A DECISION

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.595
THAT WE MADE HERE IN THIS

01:42:14.661 --> 01:42:15.462
BUILDING I THINK IS WRONG.

01:42:15.529 --> 01:42:16.697
SO THE REST OF THE VALUATION I

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:18.198
THINK IT'S FAIR THAT PARTICULAR

01:42:18.265 --> 01:42:19.399
PART OF THE VALUATION HAS

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:20.667
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS THE

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:22.202
STATE OF REPAIR OF THE EQUIPMENT

01:42:22.269 --> 01:42:23.570
HAS NOTHING TO DO.

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:26.640
WITH THE DUE DILIGENCE THAT THE

01:42:26.707 --> 01:42:28.075
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF EXERCISE

01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:29.276
BECAUSE LIKE I SAID IT'S A

01:42:29.343 --> 01:42:32.346
DECISION THAT WE MADE HERE SO I

01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:35.249
I I OUR OUR TO RESPECTFULLY

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:36.517
DISAGREE ON THAT POINT -- THAT'S

01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:37.117
ONE OF THE BIG CONCERNS THAT I

01:42:37.184 --> 01:42:37.718
HAVE THIS WITH WITH THIS BILL

01:42:37.784 --> 01:42:38.519
SOFTER RESPECTFULLY THE

01:42:38.585 --> 01:42:40.821
OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND IT AND

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:43.123
THE THE SOLUTION TO THAT IS THAT

01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:44.191
THEY DON'T GET CONSOLIDATED AND

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:45.559
THAT THE FIGURE OUT ANOTHER

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:47.494
SOLUTION TO BE ABLE TO COME.

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:48.996
AT TO RESOLVE THE CHROMIUM SIX

01:42:49.062 --> 01:42:51.131
BECAUSE THIS IS AN OPTIONAL THIS

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:54.067
IS AN OPTION IT'S NOT IT'S NOT

01:42:54.134 --> 01:42:54.601
MANDATORY YOU KEEP IT.

01:42:54.668 --> 01:42:56.169
HERE YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE YOU CAN

01:42:56.236 --> 01:42:57.538
BE CONSIDERED PART OF THE SYSTEM

01:42:57.604 --> 01:42:58.405
BUT THERE'S THIS WHOLE PUBLIC

01:42:58.472 --> 01:43:01.341
PROCESS THAT PEOPLE CAN EXTRACT

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:02.709
THEMSELVES OUT OF OUT OF THAT.

01:43:02.776 --> 01:43:04.444
OUT OF THE CONSOLIDATION SO SO

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:06.079
THERE'S OPTION I GUESS IS THE

01:43:06.146 --> 01:43:07.881
POINT IS MY POINT OKAY I'M NOT

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:09.449
I'M NOT TRYING TO CHANGE YOUR

01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:10.450
OPINION NUMBER UNDERSTAND.

01:43:10.517 --> 01:43:12.019
THAT YOU'RE RIGHT AND I HOPE TO

01:43:12.085 --> 01:43:12.786
SOME OF THE ACTIONS WE'VE TAKEN

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:15.055
TODAY CREATE ENOUGH FUNDING.

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:16.423
SO THAT WE CAN SAVE A SMALL

01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:18.191
WATER DISTRICTS LIKE THAT.

01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:19.359
ONE YES WE REALIZE THAT IT'S

01:43:19.426 --> 01:43:20.294
GOING TO TAKE TEN MILLION

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.495
DOLLARS OF EQUIPMENT WE REALIZE

01:43:21.562 --> 01:43:22.596
THAT YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE YOUR

01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:24.364
RATES TO PAY FOR THAT WHICH IS A

01:43:24.431 --> 01:43:25.365

02:07:32.878 --> 02:07:34.146
AGENCY WOULD BE.

02:07:34.213 --> 02:07:36.949
JUST TO ADD HERE -- FOR THE

02:07:37.016 --> 02:07:38.517
AUDIENCE WHO MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR

02:07:38.584 --> 02:07:40.185
WITH THE BILL WE'RE NOT TALKING

ABOUT ADDING A LABEL ON THE

PRODUCT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:07:43.856 --> 02:07:46.158
HAVING IT LISTED.

02:07:46.225 --> 02:07:48.360
AND SO IT CERTAINLY ANY THE

02:07:48.427 --> 02:07:49.762
NATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS WILL

02:07:49.828 --> 02:07:52.731
SIMPLY HAVE IT AND REGARDLESS

02:07:52.798 --> 02:07:54.233
FOR EXAMPLE OF VICTORIA'S SECRET.

SELLS IT IN FLORIDA AND SOMEBODY

02:07:57.236 --> 02:07:58.303
BUYS IT THERE AND CELLS IN

02:07:58.370 --> 02:08:00.272
CALIFORNIA EVERYTHING'S TAKEN

02:08:00.339 --> 02:08:02.174
CARE OF BECAUSE THEY ALREADY

02:08:02.241 --> 02:08:02.708
HAVE THE DISCLOSURE ON THE

02:08:02.775 --> 02:08:03.675
WEBSITE.

02:08:03.742 --> 02:08:05.110
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING OF COURSE IS

02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:07.079
A MUCH MORE SIMPLE THING LIKE

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:08.514
THERE'S AN INDEPENDENT

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:10.416
DISTRIBUTOR IN FLORIDA?

02:08:10.482 --> 02:08:12.618
AND THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THEY

02:08:12.684 --> 02:08:14.119
HAVE TO PUT IT ON THE WEBSITE

02:08:14.186 --> 02:08:15.788
AND THEN IT GETS SENT OVER TO

02:08:15.854 --> 02:08:16.989
CALIFORNIA.

02:08:17.056 --> 02:08:18.424

DO WITH THAT I THINK IT'S A

02:08:36.708 --> 02:08:37.910
VALID QUESTION.

02:23:26.998 --> 02:23:28.499
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR

02:23:28.566 --> 02:23:33.338
STAFF IS.

02:23:33.404 --> 02:23:34.772
MAKING UP AHEAD GESTURE.

02:23:34.839 --> 02:23:35.406

02:23:37.208 --> 02:23:40.611
IT SURE SHOULD AB SEVENTY FORTY

02:23:40.678 --> 02:23:41.779
SEVEN FORTY SIX PASS.

02:23:41.846 --> 02:23:43.748
AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN.

02:23:43.815 --> 02:23:44.649
WE ARE PROCESSING WOULD BE

02:23:44.716 --> 02:23:45.717
EXEMPT FROM THE SHERMAN FOR DRUG

02:23:45.783 --> 02:23:48.987
COSMETIC ACT THEREBY ELIMINATING.

02:23:49.053 --> 02:23:50.922
YOUR PROCESSING FROM CBS'S

02:23:50.989 --> 02:23:55.360
PURVIEW SO THIS IS YOUR BILL

02:23:55.426 --> 02:23:56.461
SENATOR WIENER WOULD REQUIRE.

02:23:56.527 --> 02:23:57.762
ONLY MAKE THOSE BREWERIES THAT

02:23:57.829 --> 02:23:59.731
ARE LICENSED BY C. PH ELIGIBLE

02:23:59.797 --> 02:24:01.065
TO USE THE WATER RECYCLING.

02:24:01.132 --> 02:24:02.367
AS THE BILL AS DRAFTED SO I

02:24:02.433 --> 02:24:03.434
THINK I THINK THAT CAN BE

02:24:03.501 --> 02:24:04.736
RECONCILED.

02:24:04.802 --> 02:24:06.671
AM I JUST AMENDMENTS NEED TO BE

02:24:06.738 --> 02:24:08.072
WORKED OUT BETWEEN THE TWO BILLS

02:24:08.139 --> 02:24:09.674
YES AND WE ARE AND BECAUSE OUR

02:24:09.741 --> 02:24:11.009
BILL WAS DRAFTED BASED ON THE

02:24:11.075 --> 02:24:13.277
CURRENT LAW -- OBVIOUSLY

02:24:13.344 --> 02:24:15.246
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT'S BILL IS

02:24:15.313 --> 02:24:17.548
MOVING ALONG PARALLEL TO OURS --

02:24:17.615 --> 02:24:19.183
BUT WE WERE GOING TO MAKE SURE

02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:21.085
THAT OURS IS HARMONIZED WITH

02:24:21.152 --> 02:24:22.687
WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOOD IS

02:24:22.754 --> 02:24:23.755
DOING SO I DON'T THINK WE HAVE

02:24:23.821 --> 02:24:24.989
ANY DISAGREEMENT WITH THE

02:24:25.056 --> 02:24:28.393
ASSOCIATION ON ALL RIGHT SO I

02:24:28.459 --> 02:24:29.527
HAVE A QUESTION WHICH IS.

02:24:29.594 --> 02:24:30.094
IF YOU'RE GONNA USE RECYCLE

02:24:30.161 --> 02:24:31.963
WATER AND GET EVERYTHING DONE

02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:33.264
THE WAY IT'S JUST SAD.

02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:35.767
THEN WITH A COMPANY USING

02:24:35.833 --> 02:24:38.936
RECYCLED WATER HAVE TO PAY A

02:24:39.003 --> 02:24:41.305
TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR ANNUAL FEE.

02:24:41.372 --> 02:24:42.874
WITH THE WORDS BILL NOW.

02:24:42.940 --> 02:24:45.543
WHICH BILL NO SELF THAT PASSES.

02:24:45.610 --> 02:24:47.111
THEN IT IS VERY CLEAR THEY WILL

02:24:47.178 --> 02:24:49.147
NOT BE A FEE.

02:24:49.213 --> 02:24:50.815
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING.

02:24:50.882 --> 02:24:52.583
AND IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING

02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:54.152
AS WELL MY TECHNICAL EXPERTS

02:24:54.218 --> 02:24:55.853
RIGHT CENTER WINTERS BILL WOULD

02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:57.088
NOT IMPOSE A FEED IT WOULD NOT

02:24:57.155 --> 02:24:58.489
REQUIRE LICENSE JR.

02:24:58.556 --> 02:24:59.690
BUT THE BILL WOULD JUST NEED TO

02:24:59.757 --> 02:25:02.760
BE CORRECTED TO CLARIFY THAT THE

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:04.695
AN ELIGIBLE BREWERY COULD USE

02:25:04.762 --> 02:25:06.264
THE ONSITE PROCESS WATER.

02:25:06.330 --> 02:25:08.232
WITHOUT HAVING TO BE LICENSED SO

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:09.500
JUST CLARIFYING THE PURVIEW OF

02:25:09.567 --> 02:25:10.968
THE TWO STATE AND AND WE INTEND

02:25:11.035 --> 02:25:11.702
TO DO THAT.

02:25:11.769 --> 02:25:13.671
ALL RIGHT SELL IT IS CLEAR THE

02:25:13.738 --> 02:25:16.541
AMENDMENT THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN.

02:25:16.607 --> 02:25:19.844
ARM AND WE HAVE TO MAKE.

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:22.113

PERHAPS DOUBLE JOIN YOUR BILL

WITH MR WORDS BECAUSE THEN IT

02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:27.385

02:25:27.452 --> 02:25:29.120
BOTH HAVE TO PASS.

02:25:29.187 --> 02:25:30.688
AND TOGETHER WITH AN AMENDMENT

02:25:30.755 --> 02:25:32.223
IT WOULD BE VERY CLEAR THAT THEY

02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:33.758
WON'T HAVE TO PAY THAT FEE I

02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:35.860
KNOW THAT'S A BIG ASK BUT THAT'S

02:25:35.927 --> 02:25:38.062
A POSSIBILITY.

02:25:38.129 --> 02:25:39.330
