WE DO HAVE FOUR DIVISIONS AND-

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.568
I THINK OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE LOOK

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:03.736
AT THOSE DIVISIONS AND THINK

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:04.603
THAT THEY REALLY ARE JUST

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.838
SEPARATE AND THEY DO SEPARATE

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:08.107
THINGS BUT BUT MY VIEW OF OUR

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:10.109
