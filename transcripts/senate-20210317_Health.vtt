00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:45.871
CREATE A STATE FRAMEWORK FOR

CHEMICALS ARE NOT AND THIS IS

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:41.392

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:44.095

THE COUNTY. KNOW WHAT CAN'T IT

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:54.339
CAN'T BE ADDED BEYOND THE

00:32:54.405 --> 00:32:56.007

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:10.855

AUTHORIZATION REFORMS- ARE

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:19.514
CAUSING THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:22.083
FRAUD AND ABUSE AND JUGGLING ON

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:24.052
TRACK FOR TWO YEARS- BASED ON

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:25.420
THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT HAVE

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:28.690
AUDITS. CAN YOU DRESS UP FOR ME

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:29.758

ACTUALLY PROVE THEMSELVES THAT

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.203
THEY HAVE NOT- THE DATE-%

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:43.305
BASICALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:44.439
ARE GETTING HIGH RATES OF

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:45.774
APPROVAL WITH INSTANT TWO

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.609
STANDARD DEVIATIONS SO WITH OUR

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.311
STATE. WITHIN THE NORM THEY HAD

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:50.745
THAT SHOW THAT THEY ARE GOOD

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:51.980
ACTORS THAT THEY'RE NOT ONES TO

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:54.249
ENTER PROBABLY ORDER-

01:20:54.316 --> 01:20:56.518
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRESCRIPTIONS

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:58.987
OR- PERFORM SERVICES THAT HAVE

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:01.089
REQUIRED. A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:02.891
FROM THE PLANNED SO THEY HAVE

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:05.961
TO DEMONSTRATE FIRST THAT THEY

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.629
ARE- YEAH RESPONSIBLE THAT

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:08.863
THERE AND IF THEY DON'T THEN

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:10.465
THEY DON'T GET THIS RIGHT SO

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:12.234
NOW IT'S THE FAN CAN CONTINUE

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.902
CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE. AND

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:15.837
THEN AGAIN AFTER THE TWO YEARS

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:17.772
THE PLAN CAN LOOK AGAIN AND SEE

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:20.242
WHAT THEIR BEHAVIOR IS. AND

01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:21.977
CERTAINLY UP PLANS- THROUGH THE

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:23.511
CLAIMS DATA ACTUALLY COLLECT A

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:24.946
LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:26.681
GOING ON WITH THE PHYSICIANS A

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:30.852
CONTRACT WITH- DAY AND- SO IT

01:21:30.919 --> 01:21:32.554
IS SO THEY DO HAVE THE OPTION

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.189
TO AUDIT. AS WELL AND THEY CAN

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:35.523
ALSO LOOK AT THOSE PATTERNS AND

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:36.725
THEY CAN COME BACK AND SAY YOU

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:38.393
KNOW WHAT. ACTUALLY EVEN THOUGH

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.395
HE ORIGINALLY WERE A GOOD ACTOR

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:42.764
YOUR NOW. SOME OF YOUR

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:45.634
PORTANTINO CLAIMS PATTERNS

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.135
LOOK- KIND OF THE- SERVING IN

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:48.470
WE DID AN AUDIT WE FOUND THAT

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:49.571
THERE'S PATTERNS THAT WE THINK

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.006
WE NEED TO NOW MONITOR YOU AND

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:51.840
NOW YOU'RE BACK ON PRIOR

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:53.842
AUTHORIZATION. SO THERE IS THIS

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:55.677
MECHANISM IN PLACE. BECAUSE A

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.746
PHYSICIAN HAVE TO DENNIS IT

01:21:57.812 --> 01:21:58.213
WOULD NOT BE ANY PRIOR

01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.781
AUTHORIZATIONS. RIGHT AND

01:21:59.848 --> 01:22:00.782
THERE'S A PLACE FOR PRIOR

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.183
AUTHORIZATIONS BUT I THINK AS

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.185
A- SERVER ADMIN MENTIONED AND

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:04.853
ALSO SOMETHING. FOR MY

01:22:04.919 --> 01:22:07.522
COLLEAGUES- WHEN WE USE IT IN A

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.791
BLANK AWAY. IT STOPS BEING A

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:11.960
TOOL TO. REDUCE FRAUD AND

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:13.728
INAPPROPRIATE ORDERING IT. NOW

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:15.230
BECOMES ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:16.531
THAT ACTUALLY INHIBITS PEOPLE

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:19.134
FROM GETTING CARE. AND ACTUALLY

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:24.472
AND EVEN THE LAZY CARE. THANK

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:26.608
YOU THERE'S ONE MORE- ISSUE

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:28.076
THAT I WANT TO DRESS AS I HEARD

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:29.577
SOME OF THE OPPOSITION STATE

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:31.413
AND JUST WANT TO GET YOUR-

01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:32.747
FEEDBACK ON THIS THERE IS A

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:34.449
CONCERN THAT THAT THE REFORM A

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:36.318
SHIFTING THAT COST SHARING

01:22:36.384 --> 01:22:36.918
COLLECTION RESPONSIBLY TO THE

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:38.920
HEALTH PLANS. ARE WILL MAKE IT

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.922
VERY DIFFICULT TO COLLECT. AT

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:42.891
EIGHT PM ON THE BACKEND CAN YOU

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:43.658
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT

01:22:43.725 --> 01:22:45.360
PARTICULAR ISSUE PLACED HER

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:46.261
WELL FIRST OF ALL IF-

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:47.829
COLLECTING IS DIFFICULT TO

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:49.030
IMAGINE HOW MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:50.031
IT IS FOR A PHYSICIAN'S

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:51.566
PRACTICE VERSUS THE PLAN THAT

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:52.901
ACTUALLY IS A NORMAL COURSE OF

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:53.568
BUSINESS HAVE TO COLLECT

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.136
PAYMENTS INCLUDING PREMIUMS.

01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:58.606
FROM PEOPLE SO IN OTHER WORDS-THEY HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:22:58.673 --> 01:23:00.642
TO COLLECT PAYMENTS FROM- THEIR

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:02.811
BENEFICIARIES- SO LET'S KEEP

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:06.648
THAT IN MIND. WHEN WE THEN.

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:08.683
PUSH THAT ON TO THE PHYSICIAN

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:10.285
PRACTICES THEN WHAT WOULD

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:11.486
HAPPEN IS THAT ACTUALLY DOES

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:13.355
MORE FRAGMENTATION WRITERS

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:14.856
OFTENTIMES MORE CONFUSION SO

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:16.191
INSTEAD OF GETTING ONE.

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:17.292
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FROM YOUR

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:18.827
PLAN YOU NOW GET BECAUSE YOU

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:19.994
SAW TWO DIFFERENT DOCTORS TO

01:23:20.061 --> 01:23:21.229
GET TWO DIFFERENT STATEMENTS TO

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:22.697
DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:23.331
CALLING YOU TRYING TO CHASE YOU

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:27.635
DOWN FOR YOUR PAYMENT. AND IN

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:28.470
FACT IN MANY TIMES- PHYSICIANS.

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:29.237
THIS GIVE UP TO COLLECT THE

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:31.740
COST SHARE- BECAUSE IT'S JUST

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:34.242
SO ADMINISTRATIVELY COSTLY AND

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:35.343
DIFFICULT AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:36.578
HAVE TO SPEND WHICH IS BY THE

01:23:36.644 --> 01:23:37.779
WAY THE LESS EFFICIENT WHEN

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:38.913
YOU'RE SMALLER SCALE SO THE

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.382
PLAN HAS A LARGER. SCALE TO

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:41.583
BILL DO THE STUDENTS BY THE

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:42.684
NORMAL COURSE OF USINESS

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:43.918
ANYWAY WHEN EXPECTING TO DO

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:45.587
ANYTHING. THEY DON'T. ALREADY

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:47.622
DO WE JUST COLLECT MONEY. FROM

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:48.356
PEOPLE OUT FROM FROM

01:23:48.423 --> 01:23:50.725
BENEFICIARIES. SO I THINK THAT

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:52.394
IS AGAIN A WAY TO SIMPLIFY

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:53.728
STREAMLINE AND REALLY ACTIONS

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:55.163
MORE ON THE PATIENT AND- IN

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:56.731
TERMS OF LESS CONFUSION TOO

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:57.699
BECAUSE THEY WILL SEE MULTIPLE

01:23:57.766 --> 01:23:58.900
PROVIDERS AND THEN EACH

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.101
PROVIDER IF THERE HAD EXPECTING

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:01.569
COLLECTOR OWN COST SHARED INTO

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:02.771
GOING TO GET. INDIVIDUAL LITTLE

01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:04.406
THINGS. AND SOMETIMES THERE'S

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:06.174

01:59:17.517 --> 01:59:22.255
CORRECTLY ARE EXPLICITLY ALLOWS

01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:23.222
BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS FOR ANY

01:59:23.289 --> 01:59:25.057
PATIENTS BUT THEY HAVE TO

01:59:25.124 --> 01:59:26.225
CERTIFY THAT THE PATIENT'S

01:59:26.292 --> 01:59:29.395
HEALTH WON'T SUFFER AS A RESULT

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:31.364

01:59:36.569 --> 01:59:38.337
THAT THAT WOULD INTERFERE OKAY

01:59:38.404 --> 01:59:39.672
SO WE CAN BRING IN EITHER JED

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:41.541

02:00:00.493 --> 02:00:01.928

THE TEN DAY TIME FRAME. WE DO

02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:09.335
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE BILL

02:00:09.402 --> 02:00:12.738
DOES ALLOW FOR- THE CLINICIAN

02:00:12.805 --> 02:00:14.073
TO MAKE A JUDGMENT CALL AND
