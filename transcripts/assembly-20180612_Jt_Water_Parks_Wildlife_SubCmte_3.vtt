00:41:49.207 --> 00:41:53.111 region:rollup2
LOCAL GRANTS.

00:41:51.776 --> 00:41:54.479 region:rollup2

THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED THE LOCAL

IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES IT

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:32.483 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT

THE FISCAL EFFECTS OF THIS BOND

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:51.602 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE.

00:42:49.634 --> 00:42:53.871 region:rollup2
BREAK THIS INTO TWO CATEGORIES

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:55.339 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS WILL

00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:56.741 region:rollup2
BE TO THE STATE. AND THEN WHAT

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:58.042 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE THAT COSTS ARE

00:42:56.741 --> 00:43:01.345 region:rollup2
SAVINGS MAY BE AT THE LOCAL

00:42:58.042 --> 00:43:02.213 region:rollup2
LEVEL SO FOR THE STATE.

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:03.781 region:rollup2
I WE ESTIMATE THE COST TO TOTAL

00:43:02.213 --> 00:43:05.049 region:rollup2
COSTS TO TAXPAYERS TO REPAY THE

00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:06.784 region:rollup2
BOND WOULD BE SEVENTEEN POINT

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:08.886 region:rollup2
THREE BILLION.

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:10.555 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE EIGHT POINT NINE FOR

00:43:08.886 --> 00:43:12.356 region:rollup2
THE PRINCIPAL AND THEN WE

00:43:10.555 --> 00:43:14.559 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE POINT FOUR BILLION IN

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:15.893 region:rollup2
INTEREST OVER FORTY YEARS.

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:17.428 region:rollup2
AND WE ESTIMATE THIS WOULD

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:18.596 region:rollup2
RESULT IN AVERAGE COST TO THE

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:19.697 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND OF AROUND FOUR

00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:21.365 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION

00:43:19.697 --> 00:43:23.367 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:24.502 region:rollup2
OVER THE NEXT FORTY YEARS NOW

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:26.170 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THERE LOT OF

00:43:24.502 --> 00:43:27.505 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS ESTIMATE I'M

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:29.073 region:rollup2
RELATED TO HOW LONG IT WOULD

00:43:27.505 --> 00:43:31.609 region:rollup2
TAKE TO SELL THAT BOND AND USE

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:33.778 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS WE ESTIMATE TEN YEARS.

00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:34.278 region:rollup2
THEN THE REBEKAH IN ADDITIONAL

00:43:33.778 --> 00:43:36.948 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEAR REPAYMENT.

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:38.850 region:rollup2
PLAN AND AND WE ESTIMATE OF

00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:39.851 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT INTEREST RATE TO TO

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:42.086 region:rollup2
THE DEGREE THAT THOSE.

00:43:39.851 --> 00:43:43.321 region:rollup2
FACTORS CHANGE IF THE FUNDS

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:44.856 region:rollup2
BONDS ARE SOLD MORE QUICKLY OR

00:43:43.321 --> 00:43:46.257 region:rollup2
OVER A LONGER PERIOD OR INTEREST

00:43:44.856 --> 00:43:47.458 region:rollup2
RATES ARE DIFFERENT OBVIOUSLY

00:43:46.257 --> 00:43:48.960 region:rollup2
THOSE NUMBERS WOULD CHANGE BUT

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:49.927 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUR ESTIMATE. AND HAS

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.064 region:rollup2
BEEN PRETTY STANDARD.

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:54.765 region:rollup2
FOR HOW WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT

00:43:53.064 --> 00:43:56.300 region:rollup2
AFFECTS A BONDS IN RECENT YEARS.

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:58.402 region:rollup2
AND THEN TURNING TO THE LOCAL

00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:00.505 region:rollup2
COSTS AND SAVINGS AGAIN THIS IS

00:43:58.402 --> 00:44:03.741 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT HARD TO ESTIMATE.

00:44:00.505 --> 00:44:05.776 region:rollup2
IN CASES WHERE THE STATE BONDS

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:07.278 region:rollup2
ARE REPLACING LOCAL MONEY IF

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:08.613 region:rollup2
IT'S A PROJECT AT A LOCAL AGENCY

00:44:07.278 --> 00:44:09.981 region:rollup2
WOULD BE UNDERTAKING ANYWAY

00:44:08.613 --> 00:44:10.515 region:rollup2
USING THEIR LOCAL FUNDS AND

00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:11.782 region:rollup2
INSTEAD THEY CAN USE STATE

00:44:10.515 --> 00:44:13.184 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:15.219 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS AT

00:44:13.184 --> 00:44:16.954 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:18.723 region:rollup2
AND TO THE DEGREE THAT LOCAL

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:20.525 region:rollup2
AGENCIES TAKE ON PROJECTS THEY

00:44:18.723 --> 00:44:22.426 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T OTHERWISE TAKE ON OR

00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:23.761 region:rollup2
TAKE ON LARGER PROJECTS AND HAVE

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:25.263 region:rollup2
TO PUT IN SOME OF THEIR OWN

00:44:23.761 --> 00:44:26.731 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR THAT EITHER THROUGH

00:44:25.263 --> 00:44:28.366 region:rollup2
THE MATCH REQUIREMENT. OR FROM

00:44:26.731 --> 00:44:29.967 region:rollup2
ONGOING MAINTENANCE THAN THAT

00:44:28.366 --> 00:44:31.435 region:rollup2
COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:31.936 region:rollup2
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT THEY

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:35.706 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE

00:44:31.936 --> 00:44:35.706 region:rollup2
INCURRED.

00:44:35.773 --> 00:44:39.177 region:rollup2
THE TYPES OF A BY FUNDING

00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:40.478 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THIS BOND IN THE

00:44:39.177 --> 00:44:42.280 region:rollup2
TYPES OF PROJECTS WE THINK

00:44:40.478 --> 00:44:43.814 region:rollup2
PROBABLY IT WILL RESULT IN LOCAL

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.750 region:rollup2
SAVINGS AND OTHER WORDS THAT

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:47.318 region:rollup2
FIRST CATEGORY THAT THIS WILL

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:49.153 region:rollup2
FUND PROJECTS THAT LOCALS. WOULD

00:44:47.318 --> 00:44:49.754 region:rollup2
HAVE UNDERTAKEN OTHERWISE TO

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:50.922 region:rollup2
MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SICK

00:44:49.754 --> 00:44:52.456 region:rollup2
MY.

00:44:50.922 --> 00:44:53.991 region:rollup2
TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:55.259 region:rollup2
CLEAN WATER ACT TO MEET THEIR

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:56.527 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY DEMANDS.

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:58.563 region:rollup2
AND SO WE ESTIMATE THIS

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:59.864 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WILL RESULT WOULD

00:44:58.563 --> 00:45:02.033 region:rollup2
RESULT IN SOME LOCAL SAVINGS

00:44:59.864 --> 00:45:03.334 region:rollup2
PERHAPS UP TO A COUPLE HUNDRED

00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:06.470 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. ON BASED

00:45:03.334 --> 00:45:07.438 region:rollup2
ON THOSE CATEGORIES.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:09.040 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:12.944 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:15.246 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS

00:45:12.944 --> 00:45:17.048 region:rollup2
BEST UP.

00:45:15.246 --> 00:45:17.915 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION

00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:18.883 region:rollup2
I HAVE PURCHASED A ONE SIMPLE

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:19.817 region:rollup2
QUESTION ON PAGE FOUR WAYS IS A

00:45:18.883 --> 00:45:21.052 region:rollup2
PROVIDING FUNDING FOR

00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:22.920 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED.

00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:26.023 region:rollup2
A COMMUNITY IS SO I THOUGHT WHEN

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:28.125 region:rollup2
WE NEED THE WATER WE NEED SUCH A

00:45:26.023 --> 00:45:28.492 region:rollup2
DEGENERATE FOR ANY HAD NO REST

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:31.128 region:rollup2
DOES.

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:33.431 region:rollup2
IN THAT COMMUNITY WHY.

00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:35.199 region:rollup2
DO YOU SEPARATE DISADVANTAGED

00:45:33.431 --> 00:45:37.568 region:rollup2
WHILE ADVANTAGE OF COMMUNITIES.

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:38.636 region:rollup2
SO A THOUGH THE WHY BEHIND IT I

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:39.570 region:rollup2
THINK WOULD BE OF MORE

00:45:38.636 --> 00:45:41.305 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE QUESTION FOR THE

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.607 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:44.408 region:rollup2
THIS HAS BEEN A TRADITIONAL

00:45:42.607 --> 00:45:46.310 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IN RECENT YEARS WITH

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:48.079 region:rollup2
BONDS TO TRY AND DIRECT THESE

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:49.814 region:rollup2
FUNDING I WITH PRIORITIZATION

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:51.582 region:rollup2
FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT MAY

00:45:49.814 --> 00:45:53.017 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE AS MUCH LOCAL FUNDING

00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:56.354 region:rollup2
TO UNDERTAKE THESE TYPES OF

00:45:53.017 --> 00:45:57.989 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THEMSELVES.

00:45:56.354 --> 00:46:00.024 region:rollup2
EXCEPT WHEN THERE'S A NEED FOR

00:45:57.989 --> 00:46:01.258 region:rollup2
THE WATER AWAY IMPROVING WHAT

00:46:00.024 --> 00:46:04.262 region:rollup2
THAT I AM SO SUPPLY. IT SHOULD

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:05.997 region:rollup2
APPLY TO ANY COMMUNITY WHETHER.

YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE COMMUNITY

00:46:05.997 --> 00:46:12.970 region:rollup2
IT MAY BE IS SO HE SO. NOT QUITE

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:14.905 region:rollup2
INTERESTING TO CANADA WHERE I

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.506 region:rollup2
SET A SPECIFIC.

PROPONENTS WHO DESIGNED THE

00:46:17.642 --> 00:46:18.542 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE THEY'LL QUESTIONS OR

00:46:18.276 --> 00:46:19.043 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

00:46:18.542 --> 00:46:19.610 region:rollup2
GREAT

.

00:46:25.216 --> 00:46:28.819 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE TO COME FORWARD AND

INVITATION TO US SPEAK TO YOU

00:46:49.974 --> 00:46:52.810 region:rollup2
TODAY ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE. I'M

00:46:51.509 --> 00:46:54.745 region:rollup2
JURY MARROW I AM THE PROPONENT

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:56.380 region:rollup2
OF THE INITIATIVE AND A FORMERLY

00:46:54.745 --> 00:46:57.515 region:rollup2
SERVED AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.017 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER

00:46:57.515 --> 00:47:01.919 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND DEPUTY SECRETARY

00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:03.054 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE RESOURCES AGENCY.

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:04.855 region:rollup2
ARE ALL ESPECIALLY ON WATER

00:47:03.054 --> 00:47:07.058 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:08.592 region:rollup2
WHY ARE WE HERE TODAY BEFORE YOU

00:47:07.058 --> 00:47:10.094 region:rollup2
ARE WE WE MADE A PRETTY STRONG

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:12.263 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO TRY TO INCREASE THE

00:47:10.094 --> 00:47:13.364 region:rollup2
SIZE OF A SENATE BILL SIXTY

00:47:12.263 --> 00:47:14.999 region:rollup2
EIGHT SENATE BILL FIVE WHICH

00:47:13.364 --> 00:47:16.701 region:rollup2
TURNED INTO PROP SIXTY EIGHT?

00:47:14.999 --> 00:47:18.703 region:rollup2
WE THOUGHT THAT IDEALLY THAT

00:47:16.701 --> 00:47:20.471 region:rollup2
MEASURE WOULD INCLUDE MORE OF

00:47:18.703 --> 00:47:21.839 region:rollup2
BENEFITS FOR THE WATER SIDE OF

00:47:20.471 --> 00:47:22.940 region:rollup2
THINGS HEADED DID INCLUDE SOME

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:24.942 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD ONES.

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.377 region:rollup2
BUT ARE WE FAILED IN THAT EFFORT

00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:27.712 region:rollup2
I SUPPOSE THE BLAME NEEDS TO GO

00:47:26.377 --> 00:47:29.380 region:rollup2
TO US ON THAT WE DIDN'T BE

00:47:27.712 --> 00:47:31.282 region:rollup2
PERHAPS TRY STRONGLY ENOUGH BUT

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:32.650 region:rollup2
WE FELT THAT. THE NEED OF TO

00:47:31.282 --> 00:47:41.459 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT THE

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:42.426 region:rollup2
STATE WATER RESOURCES WAS LARGE

00:47:41.459 --> 00:47:43.694 region:rollup2
ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD PROCEED IN

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:45.329 region:rollup2
THE.

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:46.464 region:rollup2
WANT TO MENTION JUST A FEW MAYBE

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:47.998 region:rollup2
THE MOST IMPORTANT.

00:47:46.464 --> 00:47:50.568 region:rollup2
IS THE SAFE DRINKING WATER

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:52.136 region:rollup2
ELEMENT WE BELIEVE THAT OF THE

00:47:50.568 --> 00:47:53.237 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS AND

00:47:52.136 --> 00:47:55.172 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:57.908 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WHO DO NOT HAVE A

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:58.576 region:rollup2
SAFE DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES.

00:47:57.908 --> 00:47:59.944 region:rollup2
REPREHENSIBLE AND.

00:47:58.576 --> 00:48:01.545 region:rollup2
JUST OF SOME OF THAT HAS TO BE

00:47:59.944 --> 00:48:02.913 region:rollup2
SOLVED LEGISLATURE'S BEEN GREAT

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:04.615 region:rollup2
IT CONTINUING TO ADDRESS THIS

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:06.016 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BUT THE PROBLEM DOES

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:07.685 region:rollup2
CONTINUE WE'VE SOLVED THE

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:08.252 region:rollup2
PROBLEM MANY COMMUNITIES BUT WE

00:48:07.685 --> 00:48:09.253 region:rollup2
HAVE MANY MANY MORE WHO HAVE

00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:10.588 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:12.256 region:rollup2
YET GOTTEN THE SAFE DRINKING

00:48:10.588 --> 00:48:13.758 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY WE HAVE TO HAVE A

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:15.126 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.

00:48:13.758 --> 00:48:16.727 region:rollup2
THE WATER IS.

00:48:15.126 --> 00:48:18.596 region:rollup2
IN THIS MEASURE IS REAL A

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:19.663 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES PEOPLE QUESTION THE

00:48:18.596 --> 00:48:20.898 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF WATER YOU CAN

00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:22.299 region:rollup2
DEVELOP BY THESE WATER BONDS

00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:24.034 region:rollup2
WE'VE CALCULATED IT'S ON OUR

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:25.403 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN WEBSITE. THAT WE

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:26.937 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THIS MEASURE WILL

00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:28.639 region:rollup2
DEVELOP ENOUGH WATER FOR THREE

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:29.740 region:rollup2
MILLION FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:31.809 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE AND A HALF MILLION

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.644 region:rollup2
ACRE FEET. PEOPLE USE ABOUT A

00:48:31.809 --> 00:48:34.945 region:rollup2
HALF AN ACRE FOOT PER FAMILY SO

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:36.547 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MAYBE UPWARDS OF TEN

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:38.315 region:rollup2
MILLION PEOPLE CALIFORNIA NEEDS

00:48:36.547 --> 00:48:40.251 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ITS WATER

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:42.386 region:rollup2
RESOURCES. STATE CONTINUES TO

00:48:40.251 --> 00:48:44.421 region:rollup2
GROW AGRICULTURE HAS DEMANDS WE

00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:46.023 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS.

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:47.091 region:rollup2
ANOTHER MAJOR CATEGORY THE

00:48:46.023 --> 00:48:48.759 region:rollup2
ANALYST MENTIONED AS WATERSHED

00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:51.195 region:rollup2

00:48:52.997 --> 00:48:56.734 region:rollup2
MANY OF OUR OTHER WATERSHEDS.

00:48:54.432 --> 00:48:58.335 region:rollup2
FIRE OF OVER GROWTH OF TREES

00:48:56.734 --> 00:48:59.503 region:rollup2
CONSUMING WAY MORE WATER THAN

00:48:58.335 --> 00:49:01.205 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD AND IT'S NOT EVEN

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:02.540 region:rollup2
HEALTHY FOR THE FOREST WE HAVE

00:49:01.205 --> 00:49:03.808 region:rollup2
TO START PAYING ATTENTION TO OUR

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.975 region:rollup2
WATERSHEDS ARE WE SIMPLY WON'T

00:49:03.808 --> 00:49:06.243 region:rollup2
HAVE THE WATER SUPPLY WE'VE COME

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:08.412 region:rollup2
TO RELY ON.

00:49:06.243 --> 00:49:09.480 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE INCLUDED A THREE

00:49:08.412 --> 00:49:11.182 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:13.150 region:rollup2
MAJOR WATERSHEDS AND MORE IN

00:49:11.182 --> 00:49:14.185 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE SMALLER WATERSHEDS.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.886 region:rollup2
TRY TO BRING THESE WATERSHEDS

00:49:14.185 --> 00:49:17.087 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE SOURCE OF OUR WATER

00:49:15.886 --> 00:49:19.223 region:rollup2
IN OUR WATER QUALITY WE HAVE TO

00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:20.658 region:rollup2
DRESS THAT.

00:49:19.223 --> 00:49:22.126 region:rollup2

ADDRESS THAT ISSUE.

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:27.498 region:rollup2
WE ARE OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE WITH

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:28.666 region:rollup2
THE WORST WATER SUPPLY ALMOST

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:29.900 region:rollup2
ALWAYS ARE DISADVANTAGED

00:49:28.666 --> 00:49:31.235 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND THAT REALLY DOES

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.770 region:rollup2
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MR

00:49:31.235 --> 00:49:34.071 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENT. REGARDING WHY SOME

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:35.873 region:rollup2
OF THE MONEY

00:49:34.071 --> 00:49:38.008 region:rollup2
DOES IT A BIAS IN THE SENSE

00:49:35.873 --> 00:49:39.276 region:rollup2
TOWARD DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:40.411 region:rollup2
OF PLACES LIKE EAST BAY MURDER

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:42.746 region:rollup2
CENTER CLEAR WATER DISTRICT OR

00:49:40.411 --> 00:49:43.314 region:rollup2
LADWP HAVE WONDERFUL RELIABLE

00:49:42.746 --> 00:49:44.715 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLIES PEOPLE ENJOY

00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:45.816 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:47.084 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:48.886 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T

00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:50.354 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT AND SO. THAT THAT'S

00:49:48.886 --> 00:49:52.256 region:rollup2
THE THE REASON REALLY THE MAIN

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:53.457 region:rollup2
REASON FOR OR BIASING SOME OF

00:49:52.256 --> 00:49:54.692 region:rollup2
THIS MONEY TOWARD DISADVANTAGED

00:49:53.457 --> 00:49:56.293 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:49:54.692 --> 00:49:57.828 region:rollup2
THIS IS REAL WATER IN THIS

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:59.697 region:rollup2
MEASURE ITS OF WATER COMING FROM

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:01.899 region:rollup2
WASTE WATER RECYCLING A DE

00:49:59.697 --> 00:50:03.534 region:rollup2

PRODUCTION METHOD SO THAT WHAT

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:08.672 region:rollup2
MEASURE. THE MEASURE WILL

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:10.107 region:rollup2
PRODUCE REAL WATER FOR

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:12.176 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:13.544 region:rollup2
A KEY EL LAW THAT YOU PASSED THE

00:50:12.176 --> 00:50:15.079 region:rollup2
END OF THE LOT OF CREDIT GOES TO

00:50:13.544 --> 00:50:15.913 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE FOR THIS WAS THE

00:50:15.079 --> 00:50:17.348 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE GROW WATER

00:50:15.913 --> 00:50:19.250 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT ACT.

00:50:17.348 --> 00:50:20.251 region:rollup2
WE PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO IT'S

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:21.886 region:rollup2
AN ACT THAT'S NOW GOING INTO

00:50:20.251 --> 00:50:23.053 region:rollup2
EFFECT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE

00:50:21.886 --> 00:50:25.422 region:rollup2
WATER DISTRICTS ARE TAKING IT

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:27.224 region:rollup2
VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT THAT WE HAVE

00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:29.026 region:rollup2
NOT FUNDED IN A BIG WAY YET NOW

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:30.761 region:rollup2
IS THE TIME TO BEGIN TO FUND THE

00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:32.596 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT BILL

00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:34.064 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR WATER SUPPLIES ARE

00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:35.599 region:rollup2
REALLY OUT OF BALANCE DUE TO

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:37.101 region:rollup2
GROW WATER OVERDRAFT.

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:38.736 region:rollup2
AS WAS MENTIONED WE DO HAVE

00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:41.939 region:rollup2
WATER FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE I

00:50:38.736 --> 00:50:41.939 region:rollup2
WANT EMPHASIZE ONE CATEGORY

00:50:42.006 --> 00:50:44.542 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THE NEED TO RESTORE

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:46.644 region:rollup2
DELTA FISHERIES

00:50:44.542 --> 00:50:47.912 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS WE HAVE

00:50:46.644 --> 00:50:50.281 region:rollup2
WITH THE STATE AND FEDERAL WATER

00:50:47.912 --> 00:50:50.814 region:rollup2
PROJECTS AND ALSO LOCAL ONES

00:50:50.281 --> 00:50:52.917 region:rollup2
LIKE COUNTRY BECAUSE WATER

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:54.685 region:rollup2
DISTRICT. IS THE FACT THAT WE

00:50:52.917 --> 00:50:56.186 region:rollup2
CANNOT EXPORT THE WATER WE NEED

00:50:54.685 --> 00:50:58.255 region:rollup2
FROM THE DELTA BECAUSE OF THE

00:50:56.186 --> 00:50:59.490 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE TO HAVE OUT

00:50:58.255 --> 00:51:01.091 region:rollup2
FLOW THROUGH THE DELTA FOR

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:02.726 region:rollup2
ENDANGERED FISH SPECIES.

00:51:01.091 --> 00:51:04.762 region:rollup2
WE HAVE PROVEN METHODS TO BRING

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:06.597 region:rollup2
THOSE FISH BACK IT CAN BE DONE

00:51:04.762 --> 00:51:08.399 region:rollup2
ITS NOT A PIPE DREAM WE'VE SEEN

00:51:06.597 --> 00:51:09.967 region:rollup2
OUR THE OH BYPASS THAT YOU CAN

00:51:08.399 --> 00:51:11.635 region:rollup2
RESTORE THE SPECIES. BUT IT'S

00:51:09.967 --> 00:51:13.404 region:rollup2
QUITE EXPENSIVE SO WE HAVE A

00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:15.005 region:rollup2
LARGE INVESTMENT THAT YOU MIGHT

00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:16.840 region:rollup2
SAY IS FISHERIES BUT IN FACT

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:18.208 region:rollup2
IT'S ALL ABOUT WATER SUPPLY. AND

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.177 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THAT IS

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:21.378 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO RESTORE THOSE SPECIES

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:23.047 region:rollup2
AND ALSO TO FIRM UP OUR WATER

00:51:21.378 --> 00:51:23.981 region:rollup2
SUPPLIES.

00:51:23.047 --> 00:51:25.582 region:rollup2
WE THINK THE FUNDS IN THE

00:51:23.981 --> 00:51:27.117 region:rollup2
MEASURE ARE DISTRIBUTED FAIRLY

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:28.485 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE WE HAVE

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:30.654 region:rollup2
A LOT OF DATA ABOUT WHAT EACH

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:32.122 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WOULD BENEFIT BY WE

00:51:30.654 --> 00:51:33.390 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S BEEN DONE FAIRLY.

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:34.825 region:rollup2
AND JUST IN CLOSING WE'RE VERY

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:36.060 region:rollup2

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:19.723 region:rollup2
WOULD INCLUDE FIVE HUNDRED

00:54:18.155 --> 00:54:21.258 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS FOR SAFE

00:54:19.723 --> 00:54:22.926 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER THAT IS

00:54:21.258 --> 00:54:24.895 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE FOR DISADVANTAGED

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:26.330 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:54:24.895 --> 00:54:27.998 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN ADDITION TO.

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:30.234 region:rollup2
PROP SIX STATE WITH TWO HUNDRED

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:31.702 region:rollup2
FIFTY MILLION YOU MAY ASK NO

00:54:30.234 --> 00:54:33.804 region:rollup2
WASN'T THERE SOME MONEY IN PROP

00:54:31.702 --> 00:54:35.105 region:rollup2
ONE FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER AND

00:54:33.804 --> 00:54:36.740 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAN

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:38.308 region:rollup2
THERE WAS THERE WAS THERE WAS

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:40.043 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION. THE

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:42.279 region:rollup2
STATE WATER BOARD HAS DONE A

00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:44.782 region:rollup2
GOOD JOB OF ALLOCATING THAT

00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:46.650 region:rollup2
MONEY AND THEY TELL US THAT THAT

00:54:44.782 --> 00:54:47.985 region:rollup2
MONEY IS BASIC EITHER ALLOCATED

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:50.053 region:rollup2
OR IN PROCESS.

00:54:47.985 --> 00:54:52.289 region:rollup2
SO THAT MONEY IS IS REALLY

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:53.423 region:rollup2
OBLIGATED.

00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:54.925 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE REPORT FROM THE STATE

00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:56.026 region:rollup2
WATER BOARD.

00:54:54.925 --> 00:54:57.995 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK THIS MONEY IS

00:54:56.026 --> 00:55:00.898 region:rollup2
GREATLY NEEDED AND WILL HELP

00:54:57.995 --> 00:55:03.167 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

00:55:00.898 --> 00:55:03.667 region:rollup2
THEN MOVING ON TO GROUND WATER

00:55:03.167 --> 00:55:05.602 region:rollup2
THIS BOND.

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:06.970 region:rollup2
HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:55:05.602 --> 00:55:08.338 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IN IT FOR

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.907 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:11.608 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT WORK.

00:55:09.907 --> 00:55:13.777 region:rollup2
IF YOU WERE IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:16.647 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. THAT WAS THE

00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:18.081 region:rollup2
YEAR END EXCUSE ME THAT THE BOND

00:55:16.647 --> 00:55:19.583 region:rollup2
WAS GOING THROUGH THE WATER BOND

00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:21.285 region:rollup2
WAS GOING THROUGH BUT AT THE

00:55:19.583 --> 00:55:23.287 region:rollup2
SAME TIME THE WORKMEN SEGMENT

00:55:21.285 --> 00:55:25.022 region:rollup2
WITH HAPPENING. AND SEGMENT

00:55:23.287 --> 00:55:27.324 region:rollup2
WASN'T FINISH TILL NEAR THE END

00:55:25.022 --> 00:55:28.792 region:rollup2
OF SESSION AND I THINK HAD IT

00:55:27.324 --> 00:55:30.394 region:rollup2
BEEN FINISHED EARLIER.

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:32.129 region:rollup2
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE MONEY

00:55:30.394 --> 00:55:33.363 region:rollup2
IN PROP ONE THAT IT WAS ALMOST

00:55:32.129 --> 00:55:35.265 region:rollup2
LIKE TO SNEAKING IT IN AT THE

00:55:33.363 --> 00:55:37.067 region:rollup2
END FOR GROUNDWATER ON THE

00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:39.503 region:rollup2
SIGNAL MONEY AND. IT INCLUDED A

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:40.871 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION THAT IT'S

00:55:39.503 --> 00:55:42.039 region:rollup2
ALREADY HOME DONE.

00:55:40.871 --> 00:55:44.007 region:rollup2
AND BY THE WAY HAVE TO

00:55:42.039 --> 00:55:46.543 region:rollup2
COMPLEMENT THE RESOURCES AGENCY

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:47.911 region:rollup2
FOR. BEING VERY TRANSPARENT YOU

00:55:46.543 --> 00:55:49.713 region:rollup2
CAN GO ON THEIR WEBSITE AND SEE

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:51.515 region:rollup2
WHERE EVERY PART OF PROP ONE HAS

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:53.851 region:rollup2
GONE IN AND THAT KIND OF THING

00:55:51.515 --> 00:55:56.320 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY HELPFUL.

00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:58.689 region:rollup2
THE INSIGNIA IMPLEMENTATION IT

00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.090 region:rollup2
REQUIRED THE CREATION OF SYSTEM

00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:02.693 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE GRAHAM WATER

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:03.227 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THE GSA'S. OUR

00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:05.028 region:rollup2
GRANDMOTHER SUSTAINABILITY

00:56:03.227 --> 00:56:06.263 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THERE ARE NO TWO

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:08.498 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT OF THOSE

00:56:06.263 --> 00:56:11.501 region:rollup2
CREATED SO WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED

00:56:08.498 --> 00:56:12.636 region:rollup2
SIXTY EIGHT NEW LOCAL AGENCIES

00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:13.971 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CHARGED WITH

00:56:12.636 --> 00:56:15.806 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THE SLAVIC HAVE TO

00:56:13.971 --> 00:56:18.442 region:rollup2
DEVELOP PLANS. AND THEN

00:56:15.806 --> 00:56:21.345 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THEM SO THIS MONEY IN

00:56:18.442 --> 00:56:23.614 region:rollup2
IN IN THIS POND WOULD ALLOW ON

00:56:21.345 --> 00:56:25.148 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROJECTS TO

00:56:23.614 --> 00:56:26.750 region:rollup2
GO FORWARD.

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:29.152 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY PLAN PROJECTS TO

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:30.387 region:rollup2
GO FORWARD THERE'S MONEY YOU CAN

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:32.189 region:rollup2
USE FOR SALT WATER INTRUSION

00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:34.591 region:rollup2
PROJECTS WHICH IS SO SIGNIFICANT

00:56:32.189 --> 00:56:36.393 region:rollup2
ISSUE ON THE CENTRAL COAST.

00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:38.328 region:rollup2
AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLANS SO

00:56:36.393 --> 00:56:39.630 region:rollup2
WE THAT'S ONE OF THE PIECES OF

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:40.998 region:rollup2
THE SPAWN THAT OUR MEMBERS HAVE

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:43.233 region:rollup2
REALLY FOCUSED ON REALLY

00:56:40.998 --> 00:56:45.335 region:rollup2
CRITICAL FUNDING.

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:47.137 region:rollup2
THEN FOURTH ON CONSERVATION THE

00:56:45.335 --> 00:56:48.605 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS WORKED HARD THIS

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:50.140 region:rollup2
YEAR THERE'S TWO BILLS THAT HAVE

00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:51.875 region:rollup2
BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:53.710 region:rollup2
THAT'S WORKING TO MAKE

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:55.212 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION A WAY OF LIFE IN

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:57.247 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. THIS FUND WOULD

00:56:55.212 --> 00:56:59.516 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THREE HUNDRED MILLION

00:56:57.247 --> 00:57:01.852 region:rollup2
FOR WATER CONSERVATION AND IT

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:03.587 region:rollup2
SPECIFIES THAT THAT MONEY CAN GO

00:57:01.852 --> 00:57:04.921 region:rollup2
FOR THINGS LIKE TURF REMOVAL

00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:06.089 region:rollup2
LEAK DETECTION WHICH IS REALLY

00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:07.591 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:57:06.089 --> 00:57:09.593 region:rollup2
ON TWELVE REPLACEMENT WATER

00:57:07.591 --> 00:57:10.727 region:rollup2
METERS AND PROJECTS THAT NOT

00:57:09.593 --> 00:57:12.996 region:rollup2
ONLY CONSERVE WATER BUT SAVE

00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:14.097 region:rollup2
ENERGY.

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:16.099 region:rollup2
SO YOU THINK THAT'S A GREAT

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:17.334 region:rollup2
CATEGORY IN THIS BOND.

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:18.635 region:rollup2
AND THE LAST WHEN I WAS GING TO

00:57:17.334 --> 00:57:20.337 region:rollup2
TOUCH ON THE SALTON SEA THE

00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:22.272 region:rollup2
SPAWNING CLUES TWO HUNDRED

00:57:20.337 --> 00:57:23.740 region:rollup2
MILLION FOR THE SALTON SEA. AND

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:25.642 region:rollup2
TWENTY MILLION OF THAT AT LEAST

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:27.144 region:rollup2
TWENTY MILLION LOGO FOR NEW

00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:29.513 region:rollup2
RIVER WORK WHICH IS CRITICAL IF

00:57:27.144 --> 00:57:31.181 region:rollup2
YOU'VE EVER. BEEN DOWN IN TOWARD

00:57:29.513 --> 00:57:32.416 region:rollup2
THAT AREA I YOU KNOW MONEY IS

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:34.384 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

00:57:32.416 --> 00:57:36.086 region:rollup2
SO THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:37.387 region:rollup2
NOT BE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

00:57:36.086 --> 00:57:42.092 region:rollup2
RIGHT. ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:45.228 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:57:42.092 --> 00:57:46.997 region:rollup2
SO.

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:48.265 region:rollup2
THERE'S MANY MANY ASPECTS OF

00:57:46.997 --> 00:57:49.800 region:rollup2
THIS THAT I. Y. CAN THAT

00:57:48.265 --> 00:57:52.302 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY BENEFIT MY DISTRICT.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:54.271 region:rollup2
.

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:57.207 region:rollup2
MY BIGGEST QUESTION AND KIND OF

00:57:54.271 --> 00:57:59.576 region:rollup2
CONCERN HERE IS.

00:57:57.207 --> 00:58:02.179 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DO DOING RECHARGE DOING

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:03.780 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER CLEANUP.

00:58:02.179 --> 00:58:06.083 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE PAST

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:07.918 region:rollup2
IN IN VIETNAM TOURS IN IN.

00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:10.220 region:rollup2
HE EVEN VISITING COACHELLA

00:58:07.918 --> 00:58:11.555 region:rollup2
VALLEY AND SEEN SONG SEE.

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.756 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROBLEM THAT WE KEEP

00:58:11.555 --> 00:58:14.458 region:rollup2
RUNNING INTO IS WE THROW MONEY

00:58:12.756 --> 00:58:15.992 region:rollup2
AT IT.

00:58:14.458 --> 00:58:18.095 region:rollup2
AND WE'LL GET A TREATMENT CENTER

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:19.529 region:rollup2
AND OR WHAT WILL GET SOMETHING

00:58:18.095 --> 00:58:21.064 region:rollup2
FOR TOGETHER FLOYD.

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:22.599 region:rollup2
THE FOLKS IN THE DISADVANTAGED

00:58:21.064 --> 00:58:24.501 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES JUST SIMPLY CAN'T

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:26.336 region:rollup2
AFFORD TO KEEP RUNNING THE

00:58:24.501 --> 00:58:27.637 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THAT WE BUILT.

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:29.239 region:rollup2
AND I'VE SEEN THIS OVER AND OVER

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:31.041 region:rollup2
AND OVER AGAIN.

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:32.309 region:rollup2
SO MY CONCERN IS THE ONGOING

00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:34.745 region:rollup2
FUNDS BEYOND THE BALL.

00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:36.413 region:rollup2
NON.

00:58:34.745 --> 00:58:38.215 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ARE WE DOING ANYTHING

00:58:36.413 --> 00:58:39.850 region:rollup2
WITHIN THIS TO SPEED UP THE AYE

00:58:38.215 --> 00:58:42.853 region:rollup2
OUR PROCESSES.

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:44.888 region:rollup2
OF FOR GROUND WATER RECHARGE.

00:58:42.853 --> 00:58:46.056 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW WE GONNA GET PASS

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:47.824 region:rollup2
THE THE SEQUEL PROCESS ON DOING

00:58:46.056 --> 00:58:49.426 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:50.861 region:rollup2
ON THE THERE SEVERAL ASPECTS

00:58:49.426 --> 00:58:52.729 region:rollup2
HERE THAT I THINK. THERE WERE

00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:54.531 region:rollup2
STILL KINDA MISSING. IT I THINK

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:56.666 region:rollup2
REALLY HEADED IN THE RIGHT

00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:58.235 region:rollup2
DIRECTION BLOOD I I'VE GOT A LOT

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:59.970 region:rollup2
OF CONCERNS BECAUSE.

00:58:58.235 --> 00:59:01.705 region:rollup2
I SEE IT ON THE DAY TO DAY BACK

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:02.839 region:rollup2
ON MY DISTRICT SPECIALLY CUT

00:59:01.705 --> 00:59:03.940 region:rollup2
COMING FROM THE CITY OF PORTABLE

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:05.042 region:rollup2
WERE WERE WHICH IS DEALT WITH

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:06.710 region:rollup2
THE CITY WITHOUT WATER FOR FIVE

00:59:05.042 --> 00:59:08.178 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:09.713 region:rollup2
THE OTHER EMERGENCY DRINKING

00:59:08.178 --> 00:59:11.481 region:rollup2
WATER FUND IT IS GREAT BUT IT

00:59:09.713 --> 00:59:12.949 region:rollup2
RUNS OUT.

00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:16.520 region:rollup2
AND WITH BONDS THE MONEY IS

00:59:12.949 --> 00:59:17.053 region:rollup2
GREAT BUT IT RUNS OUT AND.

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.823 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE WE DOING AS AN ON

GOING?

00:59:19.823 --> 00:59:23.493 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY.

00:59:21.725 --> 00:59:24.694 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT WHAT I SEE AS A LOT

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:26.363 region:rollup2
OF GREAT THINGS ARE NOT AGREE

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:27.831 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THAT THAT HAVE NEEDED

00:59:26.363 --> 00:59:29.733 region:rollup2
TO HAPPEN YOU KNOW OF A DECADE

00:59:27.831 --> 00:59:31.101 region:rollup2
AGO.

00:59:29.733 --> 00:59:33.036 region:rollup2
AND AND NOW WE'RE GIVING THE

00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:35.138 region:rollup2
MONEY IN THIS BONTA TO PUT

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:37.641 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO THE VOTERS.

00:59:35.138 --> 00:59:40.510 region:rollup2
BOY. A AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:59:37.641 --> 00:59:42.245 region:rollup2
AFTER THE PROJECTS COMPLETE.

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:44.347 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THERE ON THE MAIN SIDE

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:46.149 region:rollup2
FOR ONGOING EXPENSE?

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:47.818 region:rollup2
HOW ARE WE SPEEDING UP THE

00:59:46.149 --> 00:59:49.486 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE TO GET IT

00:59:47.818 --> 00:59:51.288 region:rollup2
BUILT?

00:59:49.486 --> 00:59:52.989 region:rollup2

LEVEL.

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:59.596 region:rollup2
AND IN REGARDS THE SIGMA HE'S

00:59:57.828 --> 01:00:00.664 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY TO DO TRUE RECHARGE

00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:02.065 region:rollup2

INJECTION WELLS WHICH ARE

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:08.738 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:10.807 region:rollup2
THE HOUSE APART A QUESTION YOU

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:13.143 region:rollup2
FOLKS IS THE IS THIS GONNA COVER

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:14.010 region:rollup2
THE COST OF INJECTION WELLS.

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:16.279 region:rollup2
PAIRED WITH.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:18.181 region:rollup2
.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:19.483 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WETLANDS HABITAT

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:21.384 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU ONLY SEE DO OUR.

01:00:19.483 --> 01:00:23.453 region:rollup2
WELL THIS HABITAT FOR WATERFOWL

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:23.753 region:rollup2
INDOOR PLUMBING BASE AND IN THE

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.455 region:rollup2
END SEEK.

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:27.023 region:rollup2
GRAVITY INJECTION WELL RIGHT

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.991 region:rollup2
THE MIDDLE OF IT.

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:29.493 region:rollup2
ON I KNOW I'VE HAD TALKS WITH

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:31.027 region:rollup2
WATER BOARD MEMBERS ON DOING

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:32.996 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:34.898 region:rollup2
WHY?

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:37.934 region:rollup2
YOU NO IT IN THAT I MEAN IT'S

01:00:34.898 --> 01:00:39.769 region:rollup2
WATER IS STILL HOLISTIC AND IT'S

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:41.204 region:rollup2
SUCH A.

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:42.939 region:rollup2
SAYING WHERE YOU CAN'T JUST SAY

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:44.241 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO DO RECHARGE

01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:46.076 region:rollup2
BECAUSE RECHARGE GONNA. THE

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:48.011 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER.

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:49.112 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THE CONTAMINATION

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:49.980 region:rollup2
IN THOSE THINGS FOR CLEANING UP

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:53.083 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:55.085 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:56.620 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SO IT'S.

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:58.255 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THIS DOES PROVIDE MORE

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:00.123 region:rollup2
WATER.

01:00:58.255 --> 01:01:01.158 region:rollup2
AND MORE FRESH WATER IN IT FIXES

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:02.526 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE CONVEYANCE ISSUES

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:04.294 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE DEALT WITH.

01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:06.029 region:rollup2
.

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:06.930 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S MY IT MY REAL CONCERN

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:08.999 region:rollup2
IS WE'RE GOING TO ALL THESE

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:11.902 region:rollup2
GREAT THINGS.

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:12.903 region:rollup2
IF THE VOTERS PASSED THE BALL I.

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:15.071 region:rollup2
WHERE DOES IT LEAVE THE

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:16.306 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY SIDE SO IF YOU

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:18.508 region:rollup2
CAN MOTHER BUT GREAT DRESS SOME

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:19.743 region:rollup2
OF THAT? FAMILIAR CAN TRY TO

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:21.711 region:rollup2
TAKE THEM THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M

01:01:19.743 --> 01:01:22.979 region:rollup2
GONNA GET BACK HOME VERY POINT

01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:24.714 region:rollup2
WHEN I TALK TO FOLKS BACK HOME

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:25.615 region:rollup2
THEY THEY LAY ASSEMBLYMAN. WOLFE

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:27.617 region:rollup2
WELL THAT'S GREAT WE'RE GONNA

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:28.285 region:rollup2
THROW MORE MONEY AT THE PROBLEM

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:30.654 region:rollup2
FULL I.

01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:31.788 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW WE GONNA DO THIS

01:01:30.654 --> 01:01:33.390 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:34.391 region:rollup2
THIS RESULT SO IF YOU THOSE

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.959 region:rollup2
ISSUES THEY'RE ALL CRITICAL

01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:37.861 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND AND AND VERY WELL

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:39.563 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OUT. THE QUESTION OF

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:40.630 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE NEW FACILITIES ARE

01:01:39.563 --> 01:01:42.165 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE FOR DISADVANTAGED

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.699 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES REALLY IMPORTANT AND

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:44.568 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:45.936 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS. PORTERVILLE I THINK

01:01:44.568 --> 01:01:47.304 region:rollup2
WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE

01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:48.838 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:50.540 region:rollup2
CONNECTING THOSE.

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:52.442 region:rollup2
AREAS THE YEAR OF NO OR POOR

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:55.011 region:rollup2
WATER WITH OTHER DISTRICTS WHO

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:57.347 region:rollup2
NEAR NEARBY WHO ARE WELL FUNDED.

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:59.082 region:rollup2
CAN MANAGE THE SYSTEMS AND NOT

01:01:57.347 --> 01:01:59.616 region:rollup2
HAVE TO RELY TOTALLY ON THE

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:00.850 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO WRE JUST BEING

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:02.819 region:rollup2
CONNECTED UP AND THERE'S AN

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:04.421 region:rollup2
INTERESTING REPORT BY I THINK

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:05.222 region:rollup2
WAS PP I SEE.

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:06.590 region:rollup2
SHOWING THE NUMBER OF

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:08.325 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY ARE

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:10.060 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING BUT

01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:11.261 region:rollup2
WHO ARE REALLY NEARBY LIKE FIVE

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:13.330 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FEET FROM A LOCAL

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:13.964 region:rollup2
IRRIGATION DISTRICT. THAT JUST

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:16.266 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO CONNECT

01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:17.100 region:rollup2
UP AND I THINK THAT'S THE BEST

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:19.102 region:rollup2
WAY TO HANDLE THE PROBLEM THOSE

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.904 region:rollup2
SMALL REALLY TINY COMMUNITIES

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:22.005 region:rollup2
THAT ARE REALLY POOR. THEY DO

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.240 region:rollup2
HAVE THE PROBLEM OF MAINTENANCE

01:02:22.005 --> 01:02:24.841 region:rollup2
WE ALLOW THREE YEARS OF

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.376 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE MONEY BUT ULTIMATELY

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:28.745 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO SOLVE THAT.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:30.480 region:rollup2
SO. I THINK THE BOARD IS GOING

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:31.915 region:rollup2
TO GIVE PREFERENCE WHERE THERE'S

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.349 region:rollup2
A NEARBY YOUR GOSHEN DISTRICT OR

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:34.217 region:rollup2
WATER DISTRICT TO DO

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:36.653 region:rollup2
CONNECTIONS.

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:37.887 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS PORTABLE THE CLASSIC

01:02:36.653 --> 01:02:38.989 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU CAN SOLVE THE

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:40.123 region:rollup2
PROBES A WONDERFUL PICTURE IN

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:41.825 region:rollup2
THEIR REPORT OF A COUPLE IN

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:43.593 region:rollup2
PORTABLE GETTING THEIR NEW WATER

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:44.661 region:rollup2
YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN IT. I WAS

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:46.863 region:rollup2
THERE YEAH.

01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:48.298 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS A MODEL WE NEED TO

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:50.300 region:rollup2
FOLLOW THEIR OTHER COMMUNITIES

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:51.468 region:rollup2
THAT ARE JUST TOO FAR. AND THOSE

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.370 region:rollup2
ARE GONNA HAVE TO FIND DIFFERENT

01:02:51.468 --> 01:02:54.704 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS AND MAYBE TRY TO

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.106 region:rollup2
ACCUMULATE THEM AT LEAST INTO

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:57.941 region:rollup2
ONE SISTER THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:59.776 region:rollup2
MY BIGGEST CONSIDER THOSE ARE

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:01.111 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE PROBLEM. FIFTH OF

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:03.013 region:rollup2
MILES ON THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:04.481 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A COUPLE HUNDRED

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:06.349 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE. AYE AYE

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:07.917 region:rollup2
SCENE ARSENIC TREATMENT PLANTS

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:09.252 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BRAND NEW THAT THEY

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:11.154 region:rollup2
JUST SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO RUN

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:12.522 region:rollup2
ITS IT IT'S A COMPLETE PROBLEM

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:14.024 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN'T HAVE A BOND GOING

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:15.759 region:rollup2
PAYING ON THE GOING SUBSIDIES

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:16.993 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY. SO THE WATER BOARD

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:18.695 region:rollup2
ETHNIC A PRETTY HARD LOOK AT IT

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:20.530 region:rollup2
AND NOT PUT IN SOMETHING THAT

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:22.032 region:rollup2
SIMPLY CAN'T BE OPERATED. BUT I

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:23.600 region:rollup2
WILL SAY THIS OF THE NEED

01:03:22.032 --> 01:03:24.934 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE WATER BOARD IS

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.603 region:rollup2
IN THE MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:28.238 region:rollup2
TOTALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND WE

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:29.606 region:rollup2
DIRECT THEM TO DO PROJECTS THAT

01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:30.740 region:rollup2
CAN BE FINANCED BY THE LOCAL

01:03:29.606 --> 01:03:31.775 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND THEY JUST HAVE TO

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.942 region:rollup2
HAVE A HARD LOOK AND SAY WE.

01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:34.411 region:rollup2
CAN'T GIVE YOU SOMETHING YOU

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:35.578 region:rollup2
CAN'T AFFORD TO MAINTAIN BUT

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:38.615 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER ONES

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:39.249 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CAN OR CONNECT UP.

01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:39.816 region:rollup2
I DO WANT TO ADDRESS YOU GROW

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:41.618 region:rollup2
WATER POINT WHICH IS REALLY

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:42.485 region:rollup2
GOOD.

01:03:41.618 --> 01:03:45.588 region:rollup2
A I DID TO HER FIREBAUGH

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:46.823 region:rollup2
RECENTLY AND THEY HAVE A PLACE

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:47.957 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY HAD A FORMER ORCHARD

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:48.458 region:rollup2
BUT THEY SAID NO WE NEED TO

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:50.093 region:rollup2
RECHARGE GROUNDWATER AND

01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:51.461 region:rollup2
THEY'RE.

01:03:50.093 --> 01:03:53.463 region:rollup2
FARTHER EAST OF THE CLAY LAYERS

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:55.498 region:rollup2
NOT INTERFERING WITH THEM AND IT

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:57.167 region:rollup2
IS POSSIBLE TO HELP STABILIZE

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:59.502 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER LEVELS BY PUTTING IN

01:03:57.167 --> 01:04:00.003 region:rollup2
RECHARGE ESPECIALLY THE FLOOD

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.537 region:rollup2
WATER WHICH IS THE MOST

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:02.939 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:03.873 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO STABILIZE THESE WELL

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:05.375 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:06.009 region:rollup2
TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTION IN THESE

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:07.210 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES CAN CONTINUE TO USE

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:09.112 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:11.147 region:rollup2
SO SICK MORE I THINK OFFERS US

01:04:09.112 --> 01:04:13.049 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO STABILIZE

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:14.751 region:rollup2
GROW WATER IN PLACES WHERE THEY

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:15.952 region:rollup2
ARE RELYING ON SHALLOW WELLS NOW

01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:17.520 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE FURTHER ON THE WEST

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:18.822 region:rollup2
SIDE YOU HAVE A CLEAR PROBLEM.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.690 region:rollup2
INJECTIONS PRAGUE AB THE WAY

01:04:18.822 --> 01:04:21.925 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH THE

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.927 region:rollup2
BOND WORKS IS.

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:25.662 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THEY WANT SO THE LOCAL

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:26.996 region:rollup2
AGENCY GOES TO THE STATES HAS

01:04:25.662 --> 01:04:28.665 region:rollup2
HERE'S OUR PLAN HERE'S OUR

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:29.966 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY PLAN.

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:32.168 region:rollup2
WE THINK WE'LL SHOW THESE

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:33.436 region:rollup2
BENEFITS YOU FUNDED NDW ARE OFF

01:04:32.168 --> 01:04:35.405 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT

01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:37.207 region:rollup2
WHICH PLANS TO FUND. BUT BOTH

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:38.074 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE BOTH INJECTION

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:40.143 region:rollup2
AND GROUND WATER AFTER YOU

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:40.977 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE OUR PROCESS THEY DO

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:42.712 region:rollup2
OF ALTHOUGH SOME OF THOSE

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:44.347 region:rollup2
PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:45.548 region:rollup2
STATUTORILY EXEMPT LIKE THE

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:47.417 region:rollup2
FIREBALL PROJECT BECAUSE IT

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:49.085 region:rollup2
DIDN'T AFFECT ANY NATURAL

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:49.719 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT WAS AN OLD ORCHARD.

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:51.521 region:rollup2
AND THEY SIMPLY DUG THE PIT SO

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:53.022 region:rollup2
IF THERE ARE WAYS SOMETIMES TO

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:54.491 region:rollup2
AVOID THAT AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:56.326 region:rollup2
CONCERN ABOUT THAT THE.

01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:58.161 region:rollup2
SORRY FOR THE LONG.

01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:58.795 region:rollup2
NO THANK YOU IT'S IMPORTANT

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:05.835 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR PUBLIC

01:04:58.795 --> 01:05:07.237 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING PIECES.

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:09.773 region:rollup2
I. GUESS I'M STILL LIVING.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:10.373 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:05:09.773 --> 01:05:12.409 region:rollup2
THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION I

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:14.844 region:rollup2
GOT STUCK SOME BASIC QUESTIONS

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:16.412 region:rollup2
ABOUT. KIND OF THE THE TIMING OF

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:18.214 region:rollup2
THE ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS TO

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:19.516 region:rollup2
HAVE THE MONEY THAT YOU WANT TO

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:21.785 region:rollup2
DO FOR THE PROJECTS THAT YOU

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:23.019 region:rollup2
WANT TO DO. AND

01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:24.454 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THE STATE HAS A

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:26.656 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ISSUED ALL BONDS

01:05:24.454 --> 01:05:28.892 region:rollup2
APPROVED TO BE ISSUED.

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:30.360 region:rollup2
SO YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:31.494 region:rollup2
IS THAT A PRACTICAL HOW IT

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.997 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE SO CAN YOU DRESS THAT

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:35.331 region:rollup2
AND ALSO. THAT THE SEQUENCING OF

01:05:33.997 --> 01:05:37.667 region:rollup2
HOW FAST IS THE SPENDING THE

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:39.302 region:rollup2
MONEY YES BUT IN FACT IN OUR

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:42.372 region:rollup2
MUTUAL DISTRICT OTHERS AND GOOD

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:43.406 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF THAT THE SMART TREAT.

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:44.474 region:rollup2
ADDITION OF THAT MY REFORM

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:46.376 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION DIDN'T NINETEEN

01:05:44.474 --> 01:05:48.711 region:rollup2
NINETY ALLOCATED MONEY FOR THE

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:50.079 region:rollup2
SMART TRAIN. BUT THE LOCAL

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:51.815 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WERE NOT ABLE TO

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:53.216 region:rollup2
APPROVE AND IMPLEMENT THAT

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:54.717 region:rollup2
PROJECT FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:56.119 region:rollup2
AFTER THAT PASSED.

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:57.654 region:rollup2
SO THE BONDS ARE NEVER SOLD THE

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:59.088 region:rollup2
STATE INCURRED NO INTEREST AND

01:05:57.654 --> 01:06:00.056 region:rollup2
THEN FINALLY THE SMART AGENCY

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:01.424 region:rollup2
SAID OKAY WERE READY AND THEY

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:02.826 region:rollup2
WANT TO THE STATE SAID OKAY NOW

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:04.260 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SELL THAT LAST BIT OF

01:06:02.826 --> 01:06:07.397 region:rollup2
REMAINING BONDS FROM PROP ONE

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:09.532 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN. AND SO FORTUNATELY WHEN

01:06:07.397 --> 01:06:10.800 region:rollup2
A STATE AGENCY IS NOT READY TO

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:12.435 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT A PROJECT THERE'S NO

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:14.437 region:rollup2
STATE DEBT INCURRED AND SO WE

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:15.638 region:rollup2
CAN WAIT AND AND IT MAY. BE MANY

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:16.673 region:rollup2
YEARS SOMETIMES IN THAT CASE IT

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.675 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:20.710 region:rollup2
HOWEVER OF WHEN THE STATE IS

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:22.345 region:rollup2
READY THE GO TO THE THE LOCAL

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:23.446 region:rollup2
AGENCY WOULD APPLY LET'S SAY A

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:25.415 region:rollup2
LOCAL WATER DISTRICT WAS

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:27.317 region:rollup2
APPLYING TO. DE OF YOU ARE FOR

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:28.751 region:rollup2
GRANT FOR ONE OF THESE PROJECTS.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:30.486 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD SAY OKAY HERE'S A

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:32.021 region:rollup2
PROJECT A WE THINK IT'S COULD BE

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:33.723 region:rollup2
APPROVED OFTEN THE STATE WILL

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:34.691 region:rollup2
SAY YOU MUST PAY FOR THE PROJECT

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:36.025 region:rollup2
YOURSELF WILL REIMBURSE YOU

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:37.994 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE TYPICAL WAY THE STATE

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:39.529 region:rollup2
OPERATES. AND SO FINALLY AFTER

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.964 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT WAS BUILT IN THE

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:42.699 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT WAS REQUESTED THE

01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:43.233 region:rollup2
STATE WOULD GO TO THE PULLMAN

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:45.268 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT ACCOUNT OF THE

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:47.504 region:rollup2
TREASURE AND SAY NOW'S THE TIME

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:49.272 region:rollup2
SO BONDS ARE NEVER SOLD INTEREST

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:50.173 region:rollup2
IS NEVER OCCURRED. OFTEN UNTIL

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:51.241 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT IS ACTUALLY

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.642 region:rollup2
COMPLETED WHICH IS THE MOST

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:54.143 region:rollup2
DESIRABLE WAY TO DO IT BECAUSE

01:06:52.642 --> 01:06:55.812 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO DEFER THAT DEBT AS

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:57.814 region:rollup2
LONG AS POSSIBLE.

01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:59.249 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS THE ANALYST DIE HAS

01:06:57.814 --> 01:07:00.450 region:rollup2
ON THEIR WEBSITE A REALLY GOOD

01:06:59.249 --> 01:07:01.885 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF THE REMAINING FUNDS

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:04.187 region:rollup2
IN A LOT OF BONDS.

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:04.754 region:rollup2
OF PROP ONE NOW THEY HAVE THE

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:06.756 region:rollup2
THE.

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:07.257 region:rollup2
LARGE ALLOCATION OF STORAGE WAS

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:08.558 region:rollup2
THERE JUST NOW APPROVING

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:09.993 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:11.060 region:rollup2
AND DOES SO NO STATE BONDS HAVE

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:12.795 region:rollup2
BEEN SOLD FOR THAT BUT THEY WILL

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:14.964 region:rollup2
BE STARTING NEXT YEAR.

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:16.266 region:rollup2
SO TYPICALLY A BOND OF THIS SIZE

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:17.800 region:rollup2
IS THE ANALYST SAID WOULD TAKE

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:19.736 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS TO COMPLETELY SPEND

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.537 region:rollup2
DOWN PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX YEARS

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:22.071 region:rollup2
TO MOSTLY SPENT DOWN THERE WOULD

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:23.640 region:rollup2
BE THE NORMAL TIMELINE FOR

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:24.173 region:rollup2
THESE.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.142 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT ANSWERED YOUR

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:27.810 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:29.312 region:rollup2
PLATE IF IT DOES BUT I THINK YOU

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:31.347 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THE OTHER. CONCERN I

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:32.782 region:rollup2
HAVE MISTER MERRILL IS THAT THIS

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:33.750 region:rollup2
IS A.

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:34.918 region:rollup2
AN INITIATIVE THAT THAT

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:36.819 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WAS BROUGHT DIRECTLY

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:39.422 region:rollup2
TO VOTERS RATHER THAN HAVING THE

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:40.356 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE. OR THE GOVERNOR AND

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:41.157 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION ESSENTIALLY

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:43.393 region:rollup2
WEIGH IN ON THAT.

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:45.161 region:rollup2
AND.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:46.696 region:rollup2
I WHETHER THERE WOULD BE

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:48.264 region:rollup2
RETICENCE IN.

01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:49.799 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE FUTURE

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:51.501 region:rollup2
TO GO AHEAD AND ISSUE THOSE

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:54.270 region:rollup2
BONDS IN AND IN FACT.

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:57.240 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:58.341 region:rollup2
GO AHEAD AND DO PRIOR SPENDING

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.742 region:rollup2
TO THE ISSUANCE OF THOSE BONDS

01:07:58.341 --> 01:08:01.077 region:rollup2
WITH IF THERE'S ANY UNCERTAINTY

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:03.346 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:05.181 region:rollup2
I WANTED THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:06.716 region:rollup2
YOU TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:09.619 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND. SO I AM AWARE OF AT

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:11.087 region:rollup2
LEAST THREE BONDS OF FOUR FIVE

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:11.354 region:rollup2
BONDS IT DIDN'T USE ISSUE

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.922 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:15.558 region:rollup2
A PARK BOND REAL BOND

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:16.159 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL INTO WATER

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.126 region:rollup2
BONDS OF AND MAY BE FORGETTING

01:08:16.159 --> 01:08:18.995 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:20.296 region:rollup2
BUT IN ALL THOSE CASES UNDER

01:08:18.995 --> 01:08:21.998 region:rollup2
BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:23.433 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIONS THEY TREAT THEM

01:08:21.998 --> 01:08:24.934 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE REGULAR BONDS THERE'S

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:27.203 region:rollup2
NEVER BEEN ANY HESITANCE TO

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:28.471 region:rollup2
PROVE OF THE ISSUANCE OF BONDS

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:30.006 region:rollup2
DONE TO THE INITIAL PROCESS

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:31.608 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO THE OTHER. AND IN

01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:33.543 region:rollup2
FACT IN MY OWN OBSERVATION OF

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:34.744 region:rollup2
THE ACTIONS OF FINANCING OF THE

01:08:33.543 --> 01:08:35.945 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS.

01:08:34.744 --> 01:08:36.913 region:rollup2
THEY TAKE THEM PRETTY SERIOUSLY

01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:38.214 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE VOTERS DID

01:08:36.913 --> 01:08:40.316 region:rollup2
APPROVE THE.

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:41.718 region:rollup2
SO SO FAR HAS BEEN A PROBABLY

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.251 region:rollup2
CAN'T SPEAK OF THE FUTURE BUT

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:46.289 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY IT HAS BEEN A

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:47.523 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:08:46.289 --> 01:08:49.292 region:rollup2
I'M I'M GONNA PAKSHA TO LEAVE

MISTER WOOD.

01:08:53.096 --> 01:08:56.199 region:rollup2
IF MISTER LEVINE MAYBE COULD

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:59.602 region:rollup2
TAKE OVER CHAIRMANSHIP THAT

01:08:56.199 --> 01:09:00.903 region:rollup2

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:10.346 region:rollup2
BY SUPPOSE THAT'S ALSO THE

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:10.947 region:rollup2
GREATEST.

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:13.016 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:09:10.947 --> 01:09:15.018 region:rollup2
WITH IT WITH YOUR BOND AS WELL

01:09:13.016 --> 01:09:16.285 region:rollup2

DOING SO WE HAVE A PRETTY BIG

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:32.101 region:rollup2
BOND HERE WE HAVE. YAMAHA NINE

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:33.770 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR BOND.

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:35.338 region:rollup2
AFTER WE'VE JUST APPROVED A

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:37.306 region:rollup2
FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BOND ON THE

01:09:35.338 --> 01:09:41.010 region:rollup2
BALLOT. AND YOU KNOW HERE JUST

RECENTLY. AT THE LA OUR REPORT.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.279 region:rollup2
VERY CLEARLY LAYS OUT THE MORE

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:45.648 region:rollup2
PAIN ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:48.251 region:rollup2
DEBT SERVICE JUST ON OUR AND

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:49.352 region:rollup2
NATURAL RESOURCES BONDS.

01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:50.953 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:53.122 region:rollup2
.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:54.257 region:rollup2
AND I GUESS.

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:55.825 region:rollup2
THE THING THAT I THINK ABOUT

01:09:54.257 --> 01:09:57.794 region:rollup2
WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO A BONDS

01:09:55.825 --> 01:10:00.029 region:rollup2
IS. REALLY WHAT THEY SHOULD BE

01:09:57.794 --> 01:10:01.998 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS HELPING LOCALS.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:03.166 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE LOCALS CAN.

01:10:01.998 --> 01:10:05.902 region:rollup2
TOLLEY COME UP WITH THE MONEY TO

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:06.602 region:rollup2
DO VITAL PROJECTS THE BONDS HELP

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:08.137 region:rollup2
THEM DO THAT RIGHT.

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:09.939 region:rollup2
.

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:11.808 region:rollup2
AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:13.076 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT WAYS WE'VE DONE THAT

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:14.177 region:rollup2
IS THROUGH PROPOSITION ONE KNEE

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:16.112 region:rollup2
AND LET LEVY BONDS.

01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:17.780 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'VE?

01:10:16.112 --> 01:10:19.849 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:21.818 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENED IN CERTAIN PLACES

01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:23.219 region:rollup2
ARE ARE LEVEES LOCALS PROBABLY

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:23.986 region:rollup2
COULD COME UP THAT ALL THEY HAVE

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.721 region:rollup2
TAX THEMSELVES.

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:27.090 region:rollup2
AND.

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:28.257 region:rollup2
BUT IN ADDITION TO HAVING THE

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:30.126 region:rollup2
BOND SUPPORT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:30.760 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:33.396 region:rollup2
OVERALL.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.231 region:rollup2
.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:36.766 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:38.901 region:rollup2
PERHAPS IT THIS WAS A LITTLE BIT

01:10:36.766 --> 01:10:40.670 region:rollup2
MORE FOCUSED IN ON ON JUST THAT.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.738 region:rollup2
AND.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.239 region:rollup2
THIS BAR MAYBE WOULDN'T HAVE

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:45.174 region:rollup2
BEEN AS.

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:46.142 region:rollup2
AS LARGE IT IS AS IT HAS

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:48.511 region:rollup2
PROPOSED RIGHT NOW.

01:10:46.142 --> 01:10:51.013 region:rollup2
AND I GUESS THE OTHER CONCERN.

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:53.416 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD LAY OUT IS.

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:55.351 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE ONE OF THE THINGS.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:56.486 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT ISN'T THERE ARE

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:58.121 region:rollup2
PLACES IN THIS BOMB WHERE. I

01:10:56.486 --> 01:11:00.456 region:rollup2
WILL COME

01:10:58.121 --> 01:11:03.359 region:rollup2
SORT OF BAILOUTS AND.

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:05.561 region:rollup2
FOR STATE AGENCIES A.

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:06.896 region:rollup2
AND AND FOR TAKING CARE OF WHAT

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:08.131 region:rollup2
I REALLY STATE AGENCIES

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:09.966 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:11.200 region:rollup2
.

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:13.970 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THAT SEEMS TO BE

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:15.705 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE OPPOSITE OF HELPING.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:17.740 region:rollup2
LOCALS MEET YOU KNOW SOME OF

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:19.609 region:rollup2
THEIR. NEEDS AND OBLIGATIONS

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:20.576 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO FOR INSTANCE

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.444 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHERE'S TWO HUNDRED

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:23.446 region:rollup2
MILLION AND THEREFORE THE

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:25.114 region:rollup2
OROVILLE DAM REPAIRS.

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:26.749 region:rollup2
THAT'S A RESPONSIBILITY OF

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:28.651 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:30.887 region:rollup2
THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS.

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:31.654 region:rollup2
IS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF.

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.489 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MY KIDS MY GRAND

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:35.057 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:36.592 region:rollup2
YEAR TO PAY OFF BY MONEY TO

01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:38.194 region:rollup2
TAKE CARE THAT.

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:40.997 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ONE I WOULD HIGHLIGHT

01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:42.899 region:rollup2
IS PAIN.

01:11:40.997 --> 01:11:44.467 region:rollup2
VW OURS AND THREE OTHER.

01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:46.035 region:rollup2
AGENCIES.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:48.437 region:rollup2
A CAP AND TRADE.

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:50.239 region:rollup2
A.

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:51.407 region:rollup2
ENERGY COSTS RIGHT THERE WERE

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:53.509 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY GONNA SUBSIDIZE WHAT

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:54.710 region:rollup2
THEIR PAIN.

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:55.945 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE INCREASING COSTS OF

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:57.713 region:rollup2
THEIR PAIN BECAUSE A CAP AND

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:59.182 region:rollup2
TRADE FOR THREE.

01:11:57.713 --> 01:12:00.783 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WE DON'T DO

01:11:59.182 --> 01:12:02.852 region:rollup2
THAT FOR.

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:04.820 region:rollup2
FRANCE'S A CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:07.456 region:rollup2
WHO'S PICKING UP THAT IN THEIR

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:08.057 region:rollup2
ENERGY COSTS. AND AND SO MANY

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:08.958 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS BUT WE'RE GONNA DO

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:10.293 region:rollup2
IT.

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:11.093 region:rollup2
FIRST SIMPSON BIG GOVERNMENT

01:12:10.293 --> 01:12:12.228 region:rollup2
AGENCIES.

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:14.163 region:rollup2
.

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:15.431 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:17.833 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:19.502 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC.

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:20.436 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS BOND NOW IT'S YOU

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:22.605 region:rollup2
KNOW MAYBE ASK YOU TO JUST

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:24.607 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:26.776 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO AREAS OKAY WELL YOU

01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:27.310 region:rollup2
KNOW IN IN THE IN THE CASE OF

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:29.745 region:rollup2
THE STATE WATER PROJECT.

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:30.613 region:rollup2
PARA COULD QUOTE POGO AND SAY

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:32.582 region:rollup2
WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY AND HE IS

01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:33.816 region:rollup2
US BECAUSE.

01:12:32.582 --> 01:12:35.318 region:rollup2
MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:36.652 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF THE STATE ACTUALLY GET

01:12:35.318 --> 01:12:38.387 region:rollup2
WATER FROM THE STATE WATER

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:39.355 region:rollup2
PROJECT OR YOUR GATE THEIR

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:42.325 region:rollup2
FIELDS OR THINGS LIKE THAT AND

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:43.459 region:rollup2
SO. A. IN THE CASE OF ORVILLE OF

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:44.760 region:rollup2
THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS PAID FOR

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:46.295 region:rollup2
THE FLOOD CONTROL ELEMENTS OF

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.763 region:rollup2
ORVILLE ORIGINALLY THAT NOT THE

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:48.798 region:rollup2
WATER CONTRACTORS AND THAT WAS

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:50.233 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE FLOOD

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:51.801 region:rollup2
CONTROL IS ALWAYS BEEN

01:12:50.233 --> 01:12:53.736 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED GENERAL FUND.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:56.239 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION AND AS I THE PAPER

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:57.373 region:rollup2
FIVEPERCENT READ OF THE TO A

01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:59.442 region:rollup2
LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT WAS A LOT

01:12:57.373 --> 01:13:00.343 region:rollup2
MORE THAN THAT BUT. WELL THEN IT

01:12:59.442 --> 01:13:02.211 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IT WAS IT WAS A

01:13:00.343 --> 01:13:04.447 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT TODAY WOULD

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:05.581 region:rollup2
BE HUNT MANY HUNDREDS MISS NINE

01:13:04.447 --> 01:13:07.450 region:rollup2
AT THAT TABLE WAS A NINETY EIGHT

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:09.151 region:rollup2
PERCENT WATER SUPPLY PROJECT. IN

01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:10.519 region:rollup2
TERMS OF BENEFITS BUT I BELIEVE

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:11.621 region:rollup2
THE COR PAID MORE F THAT IN

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:13.155 region:rollup2
NINETEEN FIFTY NINE IS A

01:13:11.621 --> 01:13:15.625 region:rollup2
FRACTION OF THE COST I COULD I

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:16.826 region:rollup2
COULD GO BACK AND SEE WHAT I

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:17.693 region:rollup2
THINK IT WAS MORE THAN.

01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:18.828 region:rollup2
BUT BUT IN THE STATE WATER

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:19.996 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS INEVITABLY ARE GOING

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:21.130 region:rollup2
TO PICK UP A LOT OF THE COST OF

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:22.064 region:rollup2
REPAIRING ORVILLE BECAUSE I

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:23.766 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THEME IS GOING TO

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:25.534 region:rollup2
PAY AS MUCH AS THE STATE IS

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:27.403 region:rollup2
ASKED US TO PAY ASK THEM TO PAY.

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:29.105 region:rollup2
BUT THE FLOOD CONTROL BENEFITS

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:30.506 region:rollup2
ORVILLE ARE.

01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:32.308 region:rollup2
I DON'T TO SAY HARMFUL BUT LET'S

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:34.043 region:rollup2
SAY NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE

01:13:32.308 --> 01:13:35.311 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY AILMENTS.

01:13:34.043 --> 01:13:36.712 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU'RE LOWERING THE

01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:38.180 region:rollup2
RESERVE WHERE FOR FLOOD CONTROL

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:40.049 region:rollup2
YOU REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:41.550 region:rollup2
STORAGE YOU CAN USE LATER ON.

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:42.885 region:rollup2
AND IF IT DOESN'T RAIN YOU

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:45.321 region:rollup2
PROBABLY CAN'T REFILL IT STIRRED

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:46.756 region:rollup2
SO YOU SACRIFICED WATER POWER

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:47.757 region:rollup2
BENEFITS REPORT CONTROL THAT'S A

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:49.492 region:rollup2
GOOD TRADE OFF THAT'S PUBLIC

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:51.294 region:rollup2
POLICY IT'S A GOOD THING. BUT

01:13:49.492 --> 01:13:52.895 region:rollup2
IT'S DETRIMENTAL TO THE PEOPLE

01:13:51.294 --> 01:13:53.663 region:rollup2
WHO ARE RECEIVING WATER POWER

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:55.464 region:rollup2
FROM THE PROJECT.

01:13:53.663 --> 01:13:57.767 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:59.568 region:rollup2
BUT THE IDEA OF THE STATE PAYING

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:01.537 region:rollup2
SOME PROBABLY ONLY GET IN THE

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:03.272 region:rollup2
END TWENTY PERCENT OR LESS OF

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:04.874 region:rollup2
THE COST OF FIXING ORVILLE. BUT

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:06.242 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY OR.

01:14:04.874 --> 01:14:07.777 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S FAIR IN TERMS OF

01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:09.512 region:rollup2
ITS GENERAL FUND BENEFITS THE

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:10.947 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL BENEFITS.

01:14:09.512 --> 01:14:12.581 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO BECAUSE AFTER ALL IN

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:14.250 region:rollup2
THE END MOST OF THE PEOPLE THE

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:15.851 region:rollup2
STATE ARE BENEFICIARIES OF STATE

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:17.353 region:rollup2
WATER PROJECT EVERYONE SOUTH THE

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:19.188 region:rollup2
TEHACHAPI IS IN MOST OF THE BAY

01:14:17.353 --> 01:14:21.724 region:rollup2
AREA AND MOST OF THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:23.659 region:rollup2
VALLEY A LOT OF IT. SOUTHERN END

01:14:21.724 --> 01:14:24.927 region:rollup2
OF IS A BENEFICIARY.

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:26.796 region:rollup2
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU GO EITHER

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:29.065 region:rollup2
WAY AND THAT AND I RESPECT THE

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:30.066 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT MAYBE THE CONTRACT YOU

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:32.034 region:rollup2
SHOULD PAY FOR ALL OF IT. BUT

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:33.102 region:rollup2
STILL A IT'S A PRETTY SMALL

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:34.603 region:rollup2
FRACTION AND PROBABLY NOT

01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:35.938 region:rollup2
RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:37.473 region:rollup2
FLOOD CONTROL WAS FUNDED

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:39.241 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY I KNOW THAT ISN'T

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.609 region:rollup2
ANSWERED SATISFIES EVERYBODY BUT

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:42.511 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR RATIONALE FOR MATT WELL

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:43.612 region:rollup2
OF COURSE AND I THINK YOU KIND

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:46.449 region:rollup2
OF ALLUDED TO IT BUT. I THINK IT

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:48.084 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE DRIVEN HOME. THE THE

01:14:46.449 --> 01:14:49.785 region:rollup2
THE COST OF HAVING A WATER

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:51.954 region:rollup2
SUPPLY PROJECT.

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:53.356 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOR THE STATE ALSO

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:56.058 region:rollup2
MEANS DOING WHAT IT TAKES TO

01:14:53.356 --> 01:14:57.760 region:rollup2
KEEP PEOPLE SAFE THAT.

01:14:56.058 --> 01:14:59.228 region:rollup2
RIGHT LIVE DOWNSTREAM OF IT.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.396 region:rollup2
NEW AND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO

01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:01.998 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE

01:15:00.396 --> 01:15:03.399 region:rollup2
SAFE SHOULD BE DONE WELL PAT

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:04.967 region:rollup2
BROWN YOU KNOW I SIT AND THAT OR

01:15:03.399 --> 01:15:06.802 region:rollup2
WILL BE BUILT BEFORE THE STATE

01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:08.504 region:rollup2
WATER PROJECT PEOPLE SAID IT WAS

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:09.972 region:rollup2
NEEDED. IN FACT THEY WERE RIGHT

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:12.141 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T NEED OR BILL BUT HE

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:13.409 region:rollup2
FLEW OVER MARYSVILLE YUBA CITY

01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:14.744 region:rollup2
AND FIVE AND SAID WE'RE NOT

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:15.745 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN

01:15:14.744 --> 01:15:17.113 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE THAT WAS WONDERFUL

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:18.814 region:rollup2
AND THEN ORVILLE SERVE THAT

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:20.282 region:rollup2
FUNCTION SO. RATES A MONTH

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:22.184 region:rollup2
ACOSTA THAT SHOULD BE BORNE BY

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:23.252 region:rollup2
THE BENEFICIARIES RIGHT AND SORT

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:25.121 region:rollup2
OF THROW PARTIES AND THE

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:27.089 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES OF THE WATER

01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:27.757 region:rollup2
SUPPLY PROJECT LOCAL THAT'S

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:29.425 region:rollup2
WHERE IT IS.

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:32.361 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO PAY FOR ARE GONNA

01:15:29.425 --> 01:15:33.763 region:rollup2
PAY FOR THAT AND AND BON PAIRS.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:35.164 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE GENERAL TAXPAYER

01:15:33.763 --> 01:15:36.399 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE THE ONE THAT'S ON THE

01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:38.467 region:rollup2
HOOK FOR THAT IT SHOULD BE THOSE

01:15:36.399 --> 01:15:40.936 region:rollup2
WHO ARE THE BENEFICIARIES OF

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:41.904 region:rollup2
THAT. WELL THAT'S IN A NO IF HE

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:43.038 region:rollup2
COULD AS THE CAP AND YOU KNOW

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:45.307 region:rollup2
WHY ARE WE SUBSIDIZING THE

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:46.742 region:rollup2
STATE'S CAP AND TRADE COSTS WERE

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:48.077 region:rollup2
NOT SUBSIDIZING.

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:49.612 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA CITIZENS I

01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:50.479 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THERE IS NO SUBSIDY IN

01:15:49.612 --> 01:15:52.448 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:53.816 region:rollup2
SECTION OF THE BOND

01:15:52.448 --> 01:15:56.018 region:rollup2
THE MONEY THAT IS PAID.

01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:58.020 region:rollup2
IN ALLOWANCES BY THOSE AGENCIES

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:59.755 region:rollup2
THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRA

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:01.357 region:rollup2
COSTA ARTIST AND SO ON. BUT WILL

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:03.325 region:rollup2
STILL BE PAID THEY STILL HAVE TO

01:16:01.357 --> 01:16:04.960 region:rollup2
PAY IT NOW INSTEAD OF IT GOING

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:06.295 region:rollup2
TO SORT OF A GENERAL CATIA THOSE

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.364 region:rollup2
FUNDS THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:10.032 region:rollup2
THE LAW IF IMPLY THE B. THIRTY

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:11.801 region:rollup2
TWO. AND THEY HAVE TO SPEND IT

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:12.735 region:rollup2
ON PROJECTS THAT REDUCE

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:14.336 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO THE

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:16.105 region:rollup2
SAME EXTENT AS IF THE MONEY WAS

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:17.173 region:rollup2
SPENT OR ANY OTHER PROJECT. SO

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:18.307 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT JUST GETTING THE

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:19.975 region:rollup2
MONEY BACK THEY HAVE TO SPEND IT

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:21.911 region:rollup2
ON ENERGY WATER CONSERVATION TO

01:16:19.975 --> 01:16:23.312 region:rollup2
REDUCE EMISSIONS AND THAT HAS TO

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:24.680 region:rollup2
BE REVIEWED THAT WILL BE

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:26.782 region:rollup2
REVIEWED BY THE AIRPORT SO IT'S

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.517 region:rollup2
REALLY NOT. ANY KIND OF SUBSIDY

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:29.084 region:rollup2
AND THE MONEY WILL STILL BE

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:32.354 region:rollup2
SPENT FOR THE SAME ORIGINAL

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:34.790 region:rollup2
PURPOSES.

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:36.258 region:rollup2

BOUT OF MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:48.003 region:rollup2
MILLION TO MORE THAN FOUR ONE

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:50.105 region:rollup2
POINT TWO THIS IS I'M NOT SURE

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:52.908 region:rollup2
WHAT THE DATE ON THIS IS BUT. SO

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:53.375 region:rollup2
I'M ALSO NOTICING THAT A LOT OF

01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:54.410 region:rollup2
THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT.

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:56.178 region:rollup2
.

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:57.580 region:rollup2
PRIVATE ENTITIES OUT THERE WHERE

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:58.814 region:rollup2
THEY WHERE THEY HOPE TO GAIN BY

01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.748 region:rollup2
THE SEAS ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:00.916 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS RIGHT WE'VE

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:02.885 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY RAISE TWO POINT ONE

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:04.520 region:rollup2
MILLION SO FAR TYPE AND ONE

01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:06.388 region:rollup2
THIRD OF THAT HAS COME FROM

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.023 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE. ONE THIRD FROM

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:09.658 region:rollup2
PEOPLE I'D SAY ARE ALIGNED WITH

01:17:08.023 --> 01:17:10.960 region:rollup2
WATER AGENCIES AND ONE THIRD

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:12.728 region:rollup2
FROM CONSERVATION GROUPS AND

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.530 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAPPY WITH THAT ACTUALLY I

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:16.398 region:rollup2
HOPE WE MAINTAIN THAT BALANCE.

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:18.033 region:rollup2
ARE SO IN THE CASE OF ALL I I

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:19.368 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO ALWAYS ATTRIBUTE.

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:21.103 region:rollup2
WHY PEOPLE GIVE BUT I'LL GIVE

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:22.538 region:rollup2
YOU MY BEST GUESS?

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:24.206 region:rollup2
THE CONSERVATION GROUPS SEE THE

01:17:22.538 --> 01:17:26.909 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OF WATER SUPPLY FOR

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:28.544 region:rollup2
WATERFALL OF WATER FOR OTHER

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:29.011 region:rollup2
KINDS OF HABITAT OF HABITAT

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:30.880 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION WATERSHED

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:32.248 region:rollup2
RESTORATION.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.482 region:rollup2
BY I WOULD SAY.

01:17:32.248 --> 01:17:34.083 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DISPASSIONATE IN THE

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:36.051 region:rollup2
SENSE THAT ARE GOING TO GET

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:37.052 region:rollup2
MONEY OUT OF IT THEMSELVES BUT

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:38.554 region:rollup2
THEY JUST HAVE THAT AS A AS AN

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:39.989 region:rollup2
OVERALL GOAL.

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:41.991 region:rollup2
THE AGRICULTURAL PEOPLE I THINK

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:43.726 region:rollup2
RIGHTLY SEE THE THREAT TO

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.628 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE FROM. ARE

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:46.862 region:rollup2
DIMINISHING WATER SUPPLY IF YOU

01:17:45.628 --> 01:17:48.430 region:rollup2
LOOK AT HOW MUCH WATER WE'VE

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:49.465 region:rollup2
EXPORTED TO THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:51.300 region:rollup2
VALLEY FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE

01:17:49.465 --> 01:17:52.801 region:rollup2
YEARS IT'S GONE DOWN A LOT FOR A

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.969 region:rollup2
LOT OF REASONS YOU COULD LIST A

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:54.203 region:rollup2
WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF REASONS

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:55.905 region:rollup2
AND AND.

01:17:54.203 --> 01:17:57.773 region:rollup2
.

01:17:55.905 --> 01:17:59.275 region:rollup2
MANY DIVERSE REASONS BUT THE

01:17:57.773 --> 01:18:00.943 region:rollup2
BOTTOM LINE IS ESPECIALLY WITH

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:02.244 region:rollup2
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:03.279 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING TO HELP

01:18:02.244 --> 01:18:04.947 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:05.948 region:rollup2
SERIOUS DECLINE IN THEIR

01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:07.416 region:rollup2
CULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND

01:18:05.948 --> 01:18:08.918 region:rollup2
SILICON VALLEY.

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:10.886 region:rollup2
THEN THIS FIXING OF THE FRANKLIN

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:12.321 region:rollup2
CANALS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. A

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:13.656 region:rollup2
DOES HAVE TO BE FIXED A LOT OF

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:15.624 region:rollup2
THE DONORS FROM THAT AREA NOT

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:16.959 region:rollup2
ALL. IN SO I THINK THEY'RE JUST

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:18.327 region:rollup2
FEELING THE THREAT OF THEIR

01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:20.129 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY TO.

01:18:18.327 --> 01:18:21.664 region:rollup2
THEIR FUTURE THEIR WHOLE FUTURE

01:18:20.129 --> 01:18:23.766 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE THAT'S MY GUESS.

01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:25.334 region:rollup2
THE WATER PEOPLE ARE REALLY

01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:27.503 region:rollup2
DIVERSE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:29.038 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO VALLEY A CONSTANTLY

01:18:27.503 --> 01:18:30.506 region:rollup2
REMIND ME IN THEIR BIG DONORS TO

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:32.241 region:rollup2
THIS EVER CULTURAL GROUPS IN

01:18:30.506 --> 01:18:34.310 region:rollup2
SEPARATE AVAIL. CONSTANTLY

01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:36.412 region:rollup2
REMIND ME THAT. BY REPAIRING

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:38.681 region:rollup2
FISHERIES THEIR PRODUCTIVITY CAN

01:18:36.412 --> 01:18:40.216 region:rollup2
BE SUSTAINED AND SO THEY DIDN'T

01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:41.617 region:rollup2
ASK FOR NEW WATER FACILITIES OR

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:43.552 region:rollup2
ANYTHING LIKE THAT NO STORAGE

01:18:41.617 --> 01:18:44.853 region:rollup2
THEY SAID FIX THE FISH FIX THE

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:46.455 region:rollup2
CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER IN OUR

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:48.424 region:rollup2
REGION. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.959 region:rollup2
VALLEY I THINK IS MORE EFFORT TO

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:51.193 region:rollup2
FIX THE FRANK KERN CANAL SOME OF

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:52.761 region:rollup2
THE OTHER FACILITIES DOWN THERE

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:56.165 region:rollup2
SO IT'S PRETTY DIVERSE AND

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:57.933 region:rollup2
THAT'S PUBLIC GOOD THING.

01:18:56.165 --> 01:18:59.501 region:rollup2
AS GLORIA.

01:18:57.933 --> 01:19:00.402 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SHARON THANK YOU FOR

.

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:06.108 region:rollup2
LUCID ANSWER STOOD TO THE

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:07.943 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS WE DON'T ALWAYS GET

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:10.579 region:rollup2
BETTER OUT OF SIGHT AYE HE SAID.

01:19:07.943 --> 01:19:11.480 region:rollup2

OUT OF MY COLLEAGUES DON'T

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.881 region:rollup2
THAT'S EXCEPTIONAL JOB OF A

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:14.650 region:rollup2
GETTING TO.

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:15.551 region:rollup2
SOME OF THINGS I WAS DEEPLY

01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:16.819 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT WHO.

01:19:15.551 --> 01:19:17.453 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT YOU HAVE TWO MILLION

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:18.454 region:rollup2
BUCKS HAD IMAGINE THERE'S SOME

01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:19.989 region:rollup2
INDICATION OF THE VOTERS.

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:20.990 region:rollup2
WILLINGNESS TO TO DO THIS I'M

01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:22.791 region:rollup2
MIGHT.

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:24.360 region:rollup2
GENERAL TUITION I'M NEW IN THE

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:25.828 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SO I COULD BE WRONG.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.396 region:rollup2
IS THAT THERE MAY BE SOME.

01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:29.164 region:rollup2
FATIGUE WITH THIS AND THEY JUST

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:31.133 region:rollup2
APPROVED A VERY LARGE BOND IN

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:32.568 region:rollup2
THE ON YOU KNOW LAST WEEK I'M

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:34.336 region:rollup2
HERE. ANOTHER GROUP COMING TO

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:35.704 region:rollup2
THE TABLE ASKING AGAIN WHAT'S

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:36.772 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC'S APPETITE FOR DOING

01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:37.406 region:rollup2
THIS IT MAY BE IN NEED OF IT

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:38.674 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALWAYS A NEED THERE'S

01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:39.642 region:rollup2
NEVER ENOUGH RESOURCES IN THIS

01:19:38.674 --> 01:19:41.677 region:rollup2
IS WATER SO YOU KNOW. IN

01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:42.778 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUT BUT WHAT IT WHAT

01:19:41.677 --> 01:19:43.646 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU DISCOVERED IN TERMS

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:46.048 region:rollup2
THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS

01:19:43.646 --> 01:19:48.083 region:rollup2
AGAIN SO SOON WE'VE HAD A TWENTY

01:19:46.048 --> 01:19:48.717 region:rollup2
FOUR WATER BONDS ON THE

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:48.917 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BALLOT SINCE NINETEEN

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:50.819 region:rollup2
SIX.

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:52.354 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE OF PASSED.

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:53.989 region:rollup2
AND HISTORICALLY.

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:55.090 region:rollup2
THEY OF THAT I GOT AN OFFER

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:56.959 region:rollup2
THAT BE HAPPY TO SEND YOU BY THE

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:58.327 region:rollup2
WAY. WE HISTORICALLY THERE BEEN

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:59.895 region:rollup2
CASES WHERE THERE WERE VERY FEW

01:19:58.327 --> 01:20:01.263 region:rollup2
BANDS ON THE BALLOT OR VERY MANY

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:03.065 region:rollup2
BANDS ON THE BALLOT.

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:04.800 region:rollup2
NINE TIMES THERE BEEN MORE THAN

01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:06.335 region:rollup2
ONE WATER BOND ON THE SAME

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.703 region:rollup2
BALLOT NOT JUST THE SAME YEAR

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:09.271 region:rollup2
BUT THE SAME BALLOT. ALL NINE OF

01:20:07.703 --> 01:20:10.973 region:rollup2
THEM PASSED.

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:12.608 region:rollup2
I THINK THE EXPLANATION FOR THAT

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:14.843 region:rollup2
AND ALSO BY THE WAY THE MARGINS

01:20:12.608 --> 01:20:16.679 region:rollup2
DURING DOG RECESSIONS VERSUS

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:18.447 region:rollup2
GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES DON'T CHANGE

01:20:16.679 --> 01:20:20.015 region:rollup2
THAT MUCH IT'S AMAZING.

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:20.983 region:rollup2
I THINK PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:22.518 region:rollup2
GENERALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.952 region:rollup2
WATER COMES FROM IF YOU GET IN

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:25.621 region:rollup2
UBER AND LEN ASK THEM THOSE SAY

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:27.423 region:rollup2
DWP YOU KNOW THAT'S ABOUT AS

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:28.824 region:rollup2
MUCH AS THOUGH NO. BUT THEY KNOW

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:30.325 region:rollup2
THEY LIVE IN A DRY PLACE IT

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:31.627 region:rollup2
DOESN'T RAIN MUCH.

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:33.862 region:rollup2
AND THEY'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING

01:20:31.627 --> 01:20:35.631 region:rollup2
ABOUT WATER AND SO OUR POLLING

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:36.131 region:rollup2
SHOWS THAT WE'RE OVER SIXTY

01:20:35.631 --> 01:20:37.232 region:rollup2
PERCENT NOW WITHOUT ANY

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:39.234 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN.

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:39.735 region:rollup2
IN PROP YOU KNOW SIXTY EIGHT DID

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:40.903 region:rollup2
VERY WELL THAT FIFTY SIX

01:20:39.735 --> 01:20:42.604 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:43.839 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE NOT TOO WORRIED

01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:45.140 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE HISTORY OF

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.508 region:rollup2
NINE TIMES YOU'VE HAD MORE THAN

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:47.810 region:rollup2
ONE IN THE SAME BELT ONCE WE

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:49.044 region:rollup2
HAVE THREE WATER BOND ON THE

01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:50.312 region:rollup2
SAME DAY OUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT

01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:51.914 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE ALL LEGISLATIVE.

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:52.881 region:rollup2
THEY'LL PASSED.

01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:54.483 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL HAS

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:55.751 region:rollup2
REMAINED ABSENCE OF THE SUCCESS

01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:57.152 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST THE RAPT EXPRESSION

01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:58.787 region:rollup2
WITHIN JUST A FEW MONTHS OTHER

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:59.822 region:rollup2
YOU EDUCATE ME IF THERE WAS.

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:01.523 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE ON SENATE STREET.

01:20:59.822 --> 01:21:02.925 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF IT HE

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:04.159 region:rollup2
WAS GONNA BE A LINK THE GENERAL

01:21:02.925 --> 01:21:05.360 region:rollup2
ELECTION BALLOT IN NEW WITHIN MY

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:07.096 region:rollup2
OWN COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.896 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT DECISION.

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:08.630 region:rollup2
THERE'S A RUN ON THE BANK IF

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:10.499 region:rollup2
YOU WILL.

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:11.767 region:rollup2
THAT'S HAPPENING SO IT'S PART

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:13.502 region:rollup2
OF WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION THAT

01:21:11.767 --> 01:21:14.103 region:rollup2
YOU CAN YOU HAVE CRIED DATA THAT

01:21:13.502 --> 01:21:15.604 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS OVER THE

01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:16.772 region:rollup2
ENDEAVOR HOPE. THAT SUCH A CRIME

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:18.307 region:rollup2
THE CLINTON SIGNATURES THAT'S

01:21:16.772 --> 01:21:22.845 region:rollup2
WHY YOU'RE HERE WELL WE'RE

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:23.011 region:rollup2
FINISHED WE DEFENSE OCCURS OF

01:21:22.845 --> 01:21:24.980 region:rollup2
OUR.

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:25.547 region:rollup2
.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.048 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S NO POTENTIAL FOR

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:27.116 region:rollup2
AMENDING THIS PARTICULAR

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:27.750 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THERE IS A LAW THAT

01:21:27.116 --> 01:21:28.417 region:rollup2
MISTER STEINBERG DID WHEN HE WAS

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:29.952 region:rollup2
HERE THAT SAID THAT THE

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:32.154 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE COULD OFFER.

01:21:29.952 --> 01:21:33.222 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES TO PROPONENTS OF

01:21:32.154 --> 01:21:34.957 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES AND THAT THE

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:36.625 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS UP UNTIL JUNE TWENTY

01:21:34.957 --> 01:21:38.293 region:rollup2
EIGHTH CAN WITHDRAW THEIR

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:39.695 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE AND DOES HAVE A

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:41.196 region:rollup2
SUBSTITUTE LEGISLATIVE MEASURE

01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:42.798 region:rollup2
THAT HAS HAPPENED ONCE ACTUALLY

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:44.266 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S NO DISCUSSIONS LIKE

01:21:42.798 --> 01:21:46.268 region:rollup2
THAT VOTE TO NOT RIGHT NOW NO.

01:21:44.266 --> 01:21:47.136 region:rollup2
AND I I GUESS PART OF WHY I ASK

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:48.404 region:rollup2
IS THAT SIR INFANTRY

01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:49.338 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:51.373 region:rollup2
THERE'S A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS

01:21:49.338 --> 01:21:52.875 region:rollup2
THAT THEY REYES I THINK ONE THAT

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:55.043 region:rollup2
CAUGHT MY EYE. IS.

01:21:52.875 --> 01:21:56.211 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO ALLOW THE

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:57.813 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COMPETE

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:59.014 region:rollup2
FOR SOME OF THESE FUNDS CAN YOU

01:21:57.813 --> 01:22:01.550 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO THE WISDOM BEHIND THAT

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:02.518 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS. THAT APPLY

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:04.520 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TO THE SIERRA

01:22:02.518 --> 01:22:06.054 region:rollup2
NEVADA CARBS ARE WATERSHED

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.556 region:rollup2
LITERALLY THE STATE'S WATERSHED

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:09.892 region:rollup2
IS THE SOONER THAT WE GET ALL OF

01:22:07.556 --> 01:22:10.426 region:rollup2
OUR WATER FROM IT FOR WELL ALL

01:22:09.892 --> 01:22:11.727 region:rollup2
BUT A VAST MAJORITY OF OUR

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:12.795 region:rollup2
WATER.

01:22:11.727 --> 01:22:14.229 region:rollup2
AND MOST OF ITS OWN BY THE

01:22:12.795 --> 01:22:16.365 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY HAVE

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:17.900 region:rollup2
NEVER ALLOCATED THE FUNDS WE

01:22:16.365 --> 01:22:19.435 region:rollup2
NEED TO RESTORE THOSE WATERSHEDS

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:21.670 region:rollup2
AND THIS YEAR NEVADA CONSERVANCY

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:23.605 region:rollup2
STRONGLY TOLD US THAT IF WE WANT

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:26.108 region:rollup2
TO. RESTORE THOSE FORESTS AND

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:26.642 region:rollup2
GET THE WATER QUALITY AND

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:26.909 region:rollup2
QUANTITY WE NEED OF THOSE

01:22:26.642 --> 01:22:28.043 region:rollup2
FORESTS.

01:22:26.909 --> 01:22:29.211 region:rollup2
THE STATE IS GOING TO HAVE TO

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:30.612 region:rollup2
INVEST WE DON'T HAVE TO INVEST

01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:32.080 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY IN SIERRA PACIFIC

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:33.515 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES LAND THEY DO A GOOD

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.883 region:rollup2
JOB OF MANAGING A. BUT THESE

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:36.251 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LANDS ARE ORPHANS TO

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:38.287 region:rollup2
SOME EXTENT IN YOUR IT'S OUR

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:39.421 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY SO WE LISTEN TO

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:41.623 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR OF A CONSERVANCY IN

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:43.692 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUED ME THE.

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:44.293 region:rollup2
FOR THAT PROVISIONAL IMPLIES THE

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:46.295 region:rollup2
SIERRA NEVADA THAT'S THE ONLY

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:47.029 region:rollup2
WHEN WE COME.

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:47.563 region:rollup2
YES I SAID AT THE OWN WITH NO WE

01:22:47.029 --> 01:22:49.097 region:rollup2
ALSO INCLUDE FUNDS FOR THE

01:22:47.563 --> 01:22:50.232 region:rollup2
FRANKLIN CANNELLA REPAIR WHICH

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:51.433 region:rollup2
IS TECHNICALLY OWNED BY THE

01:22:50.232 --> 01:22:54.336 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MANAGED BY

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:57.139 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL AGENCY. AND SO THAT

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:57.906 region:rollup2
WOULD APPLY THERE AS WELL.

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:59.074 region:rollup2
SO FORGIVE ME SO THERE'S TWO

01:22:57.906 --> 01:22:59.908 region:rollup2
PLACES IN WHICH THE FEDERAL

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:01.310 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT APPLY FOR THESE FUNDS

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:03.178 region:rollup2
NOTE WELL IN THAT CASE THE FOR

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:04.713 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL STATE AGENCY THE FRYER

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:06.148 region:rollup2
WATER AGENCY WOULD APPLY NOT THE

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:07.449 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN FACT EVEN

01:23:06.148 --> 01:23:08.450 region:rollup2
IN THE SIERRA NEVADA I'M SURE

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:09.685 region:rollup2
ALL THE FUNDS WOULD GO THROUGH

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:10.819 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCIES NOT THROUGH THE

01:23:09.685 --> 01:23:12.387 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT IT COULD

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:13.822 region:rollup2
BE SPENT ON FEDERAL LANDS THAT'S

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:15.424 region:rollup2
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:16.191 region:rollup2
AND IN THOSE THAT SECOND FINAL

01:23:15.424 --> 01:23:18.060 region:rollup2
QUESTION MR OF.

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:19.628 region:rollup2
IS THE CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:21.497 region:rollup2
PROVISION THAT SO ELIMINATED BY

01:23:19.628 --> 01:23:22.397 region:rollup2
STAFF CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHY THIS

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.966 region:rollup2
FROM THE STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:25.400 region:rollup2
THAN OTHER BONDS ACTUALLY THE

01:23:23.966 --> 01:23:26.969 region:rollup2
ANALYST HAD A.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.338 region:rollup2
STILL HERE BUT IN FACT THERE WAS

01:23:26.969 --> 01:23:31.840 region:rollup2
ONE OTHER ONE A PROPOSITION TWO

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:32.441 region:rollup2
OH FOR BY SOMEONE CASA WHICH IS

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.375 region:rollup2
WATER BOND IN NINETEEN NINETY

01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:34.910 region:rollup2
SIX.

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:36.645 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID APPROVE

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:38.180 region:rollup2
WITH CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:40.015 region:rollup2
I IN ADDITION TO THE ONE THAT

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.816 region:rollup2
THAT THE ENLISTED MENTION OF

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:42.751 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION ONE A LARGE SHARE OF

01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:45.254 region:rollup2
THAT. AND THEIR THE ANSWER

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:46.521 region:rollup2
REALLY WAS OF CONCERN WOULD BE

01:23:45.254 --> 01:23:48.090 region:rollup2
PERFECTLY HONEST CONCERN BY

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:49.424 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS OF CHANGES IN THE

01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:50.626 region:rollup2
ALLOCATIONS

01:23:49.424 --> 01:23:52.094 region:rollup2
WHEN PEOPLE SUPPORT THESE BONDS

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:53.695 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:23:52.094 --> 01:23:54.796 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS THEY MADE THEY

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:56.665 region:rollup2
WANT TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:57.566 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY THAT THEY'LL ACTUALLY

01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:58.901 region:rollup2
GET WHAT THEY'RE OF INVESTING IN

01:23:57.566 --> 01:24:01.136 region:rollup2
IN THE SENSE.

01:23:58.901 --> 01:24:03.272 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WAS THE REASON PLUS

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:04.640 region:rollup2
PREP TO FORGET A HUGE YES VOTE

01:24:03.272 --> 01:24:06.008 region:rollup2
IN THE LEGISLATURE AND BY THE

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:07.142 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND SO APPARENTLY THE

01:24:06.008 --> 01:24:09.411 region:rollup2
PUBLIC WAS PRETTY COMFORTABLE

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:11.113 region:rollup2
WITH THAT. THAT PRECEDENT.

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:14.483 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SO IT LEGISLATURE MAY NOT

01:24:11.113 --> 01:24:15.050 region:rollup2
BE A YES I DO.

01:24:14.483 --> 01:24:15.317 region:rollup2
THEY CAN IS FROM MISTAKES IF

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.085 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:24:15.317 --> 01:24:18.687 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR YOUR

ANSWERING QUESTIONS.

REPRESENTED FROM THE SIERRA

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:29.197 region:rollup2
CLUB.

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:32.501 region:rollup2
TO COME FORWARD.

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:32.668 region:rollup2
AND DATA DAVID WOLF.

01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:34.236 region:rollup2

JONES THE SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.483 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE DID TAKE IN OPPOSE

01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:50.552 region:rollup2
POSITION ON THIS BONDS.

01:24:48.483 --> 01:24:51.753 region:rollup2
.

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:53.488 region:rollup2
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS WHICH

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:54.256 region:rollup2
ALL OF TRY TO HURRY IN GETTING

01:24:53.488 --> 01:24:56.325 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:57.159 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS IS THE

01:24:56.325 --> 01:24:59.695 region:rollup2
SIZE OF OF THE BOND ITSELF.

01:24:57.159 --> 01:25:01.396 region:rollup2
.

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:02.197 region:rollup2
YEAH AS WAS ALLUDED TO THE TOTAL

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:03.966 region:rollup2
DEBT SERVICING WOULD BE

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:05.734 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE AROUND OVER SEVENTEEN

01:25:03.966 --> 01:25:06.969 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS. OP REPRESENTING

01:25:05.734 --> 01:25:07.903 region:rollup2
A GENERAL FUND COST PRESSURE

01:25:06.969 --> 01:25:08.637 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A

01:25:07.903 --> 01:25:10.839 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:25:08.637 --> 01:25:12.574 region:rollup2
AT AND I BELIEVE THIS PUTS DE

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:14.409 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AGENCIES BUDGET OF

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:14.810 region:rollup2
OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF IT WILL BE

01:25:14.409 --> 01:25:17.045 region:rollup2
QUARTET SERVICES.

01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:18.647 region:rollup2
.

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:20.182 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A HUGE HIT AND AND

01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:21.917 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW AS THE GOVERNOR

01:25:20.182 --> 01:25:24.720 region:rollup2
LIKES AWARENESS EVERY MAY.

01:25:21.917 --> 01:25:26.321 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW. BAD TIMES CAN

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.823 region:rollup2
COME AND THE GENERAL FUND IS

01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:29.858 region:rollup2
WHAT TAKES THE HARDEST HIT

01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:31.093 region:rollup2
DURING THOSE TIMES OUT WITH PROP

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:32.594 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT PROTECTING FUNDS

01:25:31.093 --> 01:25:34.563 region:rollup2
FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION.

01:25:32.594 --> 01:25:36.064 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A FUTURE LEGISLATURE

01:25:34.563 --> 01:25:38.533 region:rollup2
OR THIS ONE COULD BE FACED WITH

01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:39.835 region:rollup2
HARD CHOICES ABOUT WHERE TO CUT

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:41.269 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:25:39.835 --> 01:25:42.971 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY IN THIS OUT FROM THE

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:44.973 region:rollup2
RESOURCES BUDGET FOR OTHER NEEDY

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:45.574 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS. OR IS THAT FROM OTHER

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.476 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:25:45.574 --> 01:25:49.544 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE RECENTLY

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:52.481 region:rollup2
WORKED HARD TO TO GET PAST

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:54.149 region:rollup2
I IT IT AND SO.

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:55.017 region:rollup2
THIS SIZE THE BOND I THINK THAT

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:56.718 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW RAISE A LOT OF

01:25:55.017 --> 01:25:58.353 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ARM.

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:59.988 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT'S A PART OF

01:25:58.353 --> 01:26:00.922 region:rollup2
THE REASON THE SIZES SO BIG IS

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:02.257 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF GOING

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:03.225 region:rollup2
BONTA THROUGH THE INITIATIVE

01:26:02.257 --> 01:26:03.859 region:rollup2
PROCESS RATHER THE LEGISLATIVE

01:26:03.225 --> 01:26:06.028 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:26:03.859 --> 01:26:07.095 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:26:06.028 --> 01:26:08.563 region:rollup2
MISTER GALLAGHER SAID THAT IF

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:10.499 region:rollup2
THE BONDS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:11.533 region:rollup2
CHRISTMAS TREE. UP AND WE CAN

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:11.800 region:rollup2
AGREE I THINK THROUGH THE

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:14.002 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.303 region:rollup2
HERE IS PROBLEMATIC FOR US.

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:16.805 region:rollup2
.

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:18.407 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY

01:26:16.805 --> 01:26:20.308 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE AN APPROACH WHERE THOSE

01:26:18.407 --> 01:26:21.476 region:rollup2
WHO CAN WHO WILL SEEK TO BENEFIT

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:23.078 region:rollup2
FROM THE BOND OF THOSE WHO ARE

01:26:21.476 --> 01:26:24.046 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING THE BOND TOO AND

01:26:23.078 --> 01:26:25.280 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE ASKING FOR MORE ITEMS

01:26:24.046 --> 01:26:26.715 region:rollup2
FOR THE BOND.

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:28.717 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT AN OPEN PROCESS FOR ALL

01:26:26.715 --> 01:26:30.152 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS LIKE A LEGISLATIVE

01:26:28.717 --> 01:26:31.753 region:rollup2
PROCESS PROBLEM.

01:26:30.152 --> 01:26:34.056 region:rollup2
I'M SURE CHAIR GARCIA YOU STILL

01:26:31.753 --> 01:26:35.323 region:rollup2
HAVE SCARS FROM PROP SIXTY EIGHT

01:26:34.056 --> 01:26:35.891 region:rollup2
AND AND AND ALL THE NEGOTIATIONS

01:26:35.323 --> 01:26:36.825 region:rollup2
I HAD TO GO THROUGH FOR THAT

01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:38.226 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:40.228 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY GOING THROUGH THAT

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:42.064 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS BETTER FOR THE PUBLIC

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:43.865 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE PUBLIC IS HAS A A

01:26:42.064 --> 01:26:45.934 region:rollup2
BETTER SEAT AT THE TABLE.

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:47.769 region:rollup2
BOB AND AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THIS

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:49.137 region:rollup2
PROCESS WE SEE THAT FUND THAT

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:50.505 region:rollup2
THAT ITEMS ARE GETTING FUNDED IN

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:53.175 region:rollup2
THIS BOND. THAT AREN'T

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:54.843 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE FOR BOND

01:26:53.175 --> 01:26:57.112 region:rollup2
FUNDING IN OUR VIEW AYE. BONDS

01:26:54.843 --> 01:26:59.214 region:rollup2
ARE GREAT FOR AS MENTIONED OUT

01:26:57.112 --> 01:27:01.583 region:rollup2
WHERE LOCALS CAN'T OR MAYBE

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:02.584 region:rollup2
WON'T BE AS WILLING TO PAY OR

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:05.187 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'RE PUSHING.

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:06.154 region:rollup2
AS PUBLIC POLICY.

01:27:05.187 --> 01:27:07.722 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE WATER

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:09.157 region:rollup2
RECYCLING WHERE IT'S MAYBE NOT

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:10.792 region:rollup2
AS EASY TO GET PEOPLE ON BOARD

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:11.426 region:rollup2
FOR A RATE INCREASE FOR

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:18.366 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THERE'S

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:20.435 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE KLAMATH RIVER. US

01:27:18.366 --> 01:27:21.636 region:rollup2
DON'T SEE RESTORATION WHERE THE

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:22.938 region:rollup2
TAXPAYERS ARE ALREADY IN HOCK.

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:25.040 region:rollup2
INSTEAD WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

01:27:22.938 --> 01:27:25.640 region:rollup2
AS ⰭHINK

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.142 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.377 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE ORVILLE WHERE THERE

01:27:27.142 --> 01:27:30.879 region:rollup2
ARE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO ARE

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:33.115 region:rollup2
LEGALLY REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THAT

01:27:30.879 --> 01:27:34.416 region:rollup2
FUNDING OR THE FRANK CURRENT CAN

01:27:33.115 --> 01:27:35.851 region:rollup2
NOW WHERE THERE ARE. EITHER

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:37.285 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE THOSE

01:27:35.851 --> 01:27:39.020 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THE PROJECTS

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:40.288 region:rollup2
OR THEORETICALLY YOU COULD HOLDS

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:41.389 region:rollup2
OUT THOSE WHO DAMAGE THE CAN

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:42.257 region:rollup2
DOWN THE FIRST PLACE THROUGH

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:43.625 region:rollup2
OVER PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER. AT

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.993 region:rollup2
FAULT

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:46.228 region:rollup2
I'M INSTEAD THAT'S THAT'S

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:47.863 region:rollup2
GETTING PUSHED ON THE TAXPAYER

01:27:46.228 --> 01:27:49.331 region:rollup2
AND AND TO THE EXTENT THAT MAYBE

01:27:47.863 --> 01:27:50.899 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD CONSIDER THINGS ABOUT.

01:27:49.331 --> 01:27:52.667 region:rollup2
STOP.

01:27:50.899 --> 01:27:54.102 region:rollup2
WHERE WHERE WE SHIFT THE POLICY

01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:56.304 region:rollup2
ON THOSE AND WHERE?

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:57.405 region:rollup2
WE THINK ABOUT OR BILL AND AND

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:58.807 region:rollup2
WHAT ROLE THE FLOOD CONTROL

01:27:57.405 --> 01:28:00.976 region:rollup2
ABOUT FLOOD CONTROL BENEFIT IT

01:27:58.807 --> 01:28:01.877 region:rollup2
PROVIDES A THAT IS BEST DONE I

01:28:00.976 --> 01:28:03.512 region:rollup2
THINK THROUGH DELIBERATE OF

01:28:01.877 --> 01:28:05.413 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY PROCESS RATHER

01:28:03.512 --> 01:28:06.248 region:rollup2
THAN A INITIATIVE PROCESS FOR

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:08.183 region:rollup2
AVANT.

01:28:06.248 --> 01:28:09.784 region:rollup2
.

01:28:08.183 --> 01:28:10.619 region:rollup2
WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT ALL

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:11.787 region:rollup2
OF THESE ITEMS ARE ALL

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:12.754 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED AND

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:14.356 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO FUTURE LEGISLATIVE

01:28:12.754 --> 01:28:15.757 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT.

01:28:14.356 --> 01:28:16.958 region:rollup2
AT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY GIVING

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:18.493 region:rollup2
AWAY LARGE AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:19.528 region:rollup2
MONEY AND AND WE AYE I DON'T

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:21.630 region:rollup2
KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT WILL BE ABLE

01:28:19.528 --> 01:28:22.297 region:rollup2
TO COME BACK AND SEE IT AGAIN.

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:24.900 region:rollup2
S. AND IT WITHOUT.

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:27.235 region:rollup2
.

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:29.938 region:rollup2
BUT THEN I JUST KINDOF WANTED

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:30.505 region:rollup2
TO ENDS WITH A DISCUSSION AROUND

01:28:29.938 --> 01:28:31.406 region:rollup2
THE TEACHER A FUNDING AT THE

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:34.242 region:rollup2
MOMENT.

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:35.710 region:rollup2
AS WAS MENTIONED BY AGENCIES

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:37.712 region:rollup2
WHO PAY INTO THE G. GIRAFFE WILL

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:39.147 region:rollup2
GET THAT MONEY BACK.

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:39.681 region:rollup2
FORWATER CONSERVATION PROJECTS

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:41.449 region:rollup2
AND

01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:43.118 region:rollup2
OF.

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:44.653 region:rollup2
I GUESS ONE THING IT'S NOT CLEAR

01:28:43.118 --> 01:28:46.755 region:rollup2
TO ME ON THAT IS IS HOW DOES

01:28:44.653 --> 01:28:47.656 region:rollup2
THAT AFFECT THE OTHER SIXTY

01:28:46.755 --> 01:28:48.790 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE GDR UP THAT'S

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:49.424 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN CONTINUOUSLY

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:50.759 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATED SUCH AS HIGH SPEED

01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:51.993 region:rollup2
RAIL.

01:28:50.759 --> 01:28:53.461 region:rollup2
ARE ARE THEY STILL PAYING INTO

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:55.130 region:rollup2
THAT PORTION OR DOES THAT MEAN

01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:57.132 region:rollup2
EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY IS NOW.

01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:58.667 region:rollup2
INCREASING THEIR SHARE OF COSTS

01:28:57.132 --> 01:29:01.269 region:rollup2
INTO THOSE PROGRAMS.

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:04.306 region:rollup2
AND SECONDLY.

01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:06.408 region:rollup2
THE G. GIRAFFE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON

01:29:04.306 --> 01:29:08.343 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT CLIMATE REDUCTIONS

01:29:06.408 --> 01:29:09.778 region:rollup2
WATER CONSERVATION CAN SAVE

01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:11.246 region:rollup2
ENERGY AND CAN REDUCE GREENHOUSE

01:29:09.778 --> 01:29:12.948 region:rollup2
GAS EMISSIONS.

01:29:11.246 --> 01:29:13.748 region:rollup2
BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST

01:29:12.948 --> 01:29:15.617 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT QUICKEST WAY TO GET

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:17.319 region:rollup2
THAT DONE. OUT WE ARE FACING AN

01:29:15.617 --> 01:29:18.954 region:rollup2
EXISTENTIAL CRISIS OF OUR TIME

01:29:17.319 --> 01:29:20.422 region:rollup2
AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:29:18.954 --> 01:29:21.223 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE SPENT.

01:29:20.422 --> 01:29:22.824 region:rollup2
IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY

01:29:21.223 --> 01:29:24.359 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:24.960 region:rollup2
AND ENDS YOU KNOW TURF

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:27.662 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:29.197 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:30.465 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SOUTH ATTACHED PIECE

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:31.166 region:rollup2
CAN SAVE SOME ENERGY BECAUSE

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:32.300 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT PUMPING THAT MUCH

01:29:31.166 --> 01:29:33.568 region:rollup2
WATER OVER THERE BUT.

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.836 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULDN'T COME AT THE

01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:36.671 region:rollup2
EXPENSE OF ELECTRIFYING FREIGHT

01:29:34.836 --> 01:29:38.273 region:rollup2
FLEETS

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:39.808 region:rollup2
IN THE SOUTH COAST THAT IS YOU

01:29:38.273 --> 01:29:41.743 region:rollup2
KNOW PRODUCING A LARGE AMOUNT OF

01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:43.278 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AND ALSO IMPROVING AIR

01:29:41.743 --> 01:29:45.747 region:rollup2
QUALITY AND SAVING LIVES.

01:29:43.278 --> 01:29:46.882 region:rollup2
SO LOCKING THAT FUNDING AWAY.

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:48.617 region:rollup2
FROM ANY CONTROL FOR THE

01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:50.652 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IT IS PROBLEMATIC

01:29:48.617 --> 01:29:53.021 region:rollup2
AND UP FOR THOSE REASONS AND

01:29:50.652 --> 01:29:53.622 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE BUT MORE DOWN IN

01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:54.890 region:rollup2
THE WEEDS I DON'T WANNA PARTY

01:29:53.622 --> 01:29:57.859 region:rollup2
WHICH DAY.

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:59.494 region:rollup2
WE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE.

01:29:57.859 --> 01:30:00.462 region:rollup2

NOVEMBER BALLOT I DO WANT TO

HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS

01:30:11.673 --> 01:30:14.776 region:rollup2

TIME. ITEM AND YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:30:16.645 --> 01:30:18.580 region:rollup2
MERELY BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE

01:30:18.346 --> 01:30:19.814 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:21.783 region:rollup2
.

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:23.518 region:rollup2
OUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE VIEW ON

01:30:21.783 --> 01:30:24.786 region:rollup2
TERM DEBT AND DECISIONS ON THIS

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:26.454 region:rollup2
BOND SAID THAT BASICALLY MEANS I

01:30:24.786 --> 01:30:27.689 region:rollup2
GET TO NERD OUT ON FISCAL STUFF

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:29.958 region:rollup2

01:30:27.689 --> 01:30:31.559 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING

01:30:29.958 --> 01:30:34.129 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT I WANT TO KNOW FROM

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:36.665 region:rollup2
THE OUTSET MISTER CHAIRMAN PITT

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:38.466 region:rollup2
HHA IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY OPPOSED

01:30:36.665 --> 01:30:40.535 region:rollup2
TO ALL STATE GEO BONDS. WE DID

01:30:38.466 --> 01:30:42.070 region:rollup2
TAKE A NEUTRAL POSITION ON PROP

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:43.538 region:rollup2
ONE A SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BOND

01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:44.873 region:rollup2
FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN IN WHICH

01:30:43.538 --> 01:30:46.975 region:rollup2
SHALL ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THAT

01:30:44.873 --> 01:30:48.910 region:rollup2
MONEY DID GO. TO.

01:30:46.975 --> 01:30:51.146 region:rollup2
INCREASED WATER STORAGE WATER

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:52.247 region:rollup2
CAPACITY PROJECTS LIKE SITES AND

01:30:51.146 --> 01:30:54.516 region:rollup2
TEMPERANCE FLATS.

01:30:52.247 --> 01:30:56.251 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS AND I WOULD STRESS

01:30:54.516 --> 01:30:56.885 region:rollup2
THEY ARE JUST CONCERNS AT THIS

01:30:56.251 --> 01:30:58.553 region:rollup2
POINT THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THIS

01:30:56.885 --> 01:31:00.622 region:rollup2
BOND IS THAT IT'S BIGGER THAN

01:30:58.553 --> 01:31:02.991 region:rollup2
PROP ONE WITH LESS OF PERCENTAGE

01:31:00.622 --> 01:31:05.160 region:rollup2
OF THOSE FUNDS. GOING TO VARIOUS

01:31:02.991 --> 01:31:05.760 region:rollup2
WATER STORAGE PROJECTS.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.562 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN DON'T

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:09.230 region:rollup2
MISUNDERSTAND OBVIOUSLY.

01:31:07.562 --> 01:31:11.299 region:rollup2
WASTE WATER RECYCLING DE SALLE

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:13.168 region:rollup2
PROJECTS DO YOU ADD ROLE WATER

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:15.537 region:rollup2
AND WE DO THINK THERE'S VALUE TO

01:31:13.168 --> 01:31:18.173 region:rollup2
THOSE PROJECTS BUT I THINK WE DO

01:31:15.537 --> 01:31:19.641 region:rollup2
NEED TO ASK BED.

01:31:18.173 --> 01:31:22.510 region:rollup2
IF IT'S IMPORTANT FOR.

01:31:19.641 --> 01:31:23.411 region:rollup2
.

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:24.679 region:rollup2
THE PROJECTS TO LIE STILL AND

01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:26.448 region:rollup2
FOR THE BOND WHICH WE BELIEVE IS

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:30.418 region:rollup2
A CRIER YOU KNOW IS A PRIORITY.

01:31:26.448 --> 01:31:33.388 region:rollup2
FOR BOND PROJECTS.

01:31:30.418 --> 01:31:34.422 region:rollup2
DO YOU DESALINATED STORAGE

01:31:33.388 --> 01:31:35.423 region:rollup2
PROJECTS DO THEY LOST UNDER THE

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:37.959 region:rollup2
BOND PERHAPS BUT ARE THEY THE

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:41.029 region:rollup2
BEST USE OF THOSE BOND DOLLARS.

01:31:37.959 --> 01:31:42.731 region:rollup2
AND COULD EXPANDING RESERVOIRS

01:31:41.029 --> 01:31:44.432 region:rollup2
AND BUILDING DAMS AND EVEN

01:31:42.731 --> 01:31:46.234 region:rollup2
ADDING UNDERGROUND STORAGE

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:48.036 region:rollup2
AQUIFER RECHARGE TYPE PROJECTS

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:49.404 region:rollup2
OF THAT BE A BETTER USE OF BOND

01:31:48.036 --> 01:31:50.638 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. FOR THE BUCK AND I

01:31:49.404 --> 01:31:52.007 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:54.376 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DOES NEED TO BE LOOKED

01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:55.643 region:rollup2
INTO AND YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY

01:31:54.376 --> 01:31:57.412 region:rollup2
I THINK AS WAS MENTIONED WHEN

01:31:55.643 --> 01:31:58.680 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE A BOND. THAT GOES

01:31:57.412 --> 01:32:01.149 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE YOU

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:02.083 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY DO RUN THE RISK OF

01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:03.985 region:rollup2
THOSE PROBLEMS OCCURRING AND I

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:05.420 region:rollup2
THINK A.

01:32:03.985 --> 01:32:06.721 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE AGREE WITH THAT ON

01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:10.392 region:rollup2
SOME LEVEL.

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:12.694 region:rollup2
.

01:32:10.392 --> 01:32:13.995 region:rollup2
JUST TO CONTINUE AND YOU HAVE.

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:16.364 region:rollup2
THIS CHAIR CALLED ALREADY

01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:17.866 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT SORT OF THE ISSUE

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:19.534 region:rollup2
WITH ON GOING THAT OUR DEBT

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:21.069 region:rollup2
SERVICE RATIO RIGHT NOW

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:22.437 region:rollup2
DOMINATES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:32:21.069 --> 01:32:24.038 region:rollup2
THAT'S PAID OUT A GENERAL FUND

01:32:22.437 --> 01:32:25.974 region:rollup2
SOLELY TO PAY OFF BOND THAT. IS

01:32:24.038 --> 01:32:27.409 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE PERCENT AND IT CAN BE

01:32:25.974 --> 01:32:30.044 region:rollup2
DEBATED WHETHER OR NOT THAT

01:32:27.409 --> 01:32:31.813 region:rollup2
NUMBER IS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW.

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:33.815 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S EVEN DEBATES ABOUT

01:32:31.813 --> 01:32:35.884 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW IN MY OFFICE OF

01:32:33.815 --> 01:32:37.419 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT. BUT I THINK THE FACT

01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:40.021 region:rollup2
REMAINS IN THE QUESTION WE NEED

01:32:37.419 --> 01:32:40.722 region:rollup2
TO ASK IS THERE'S NO PRIORITY OF

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:42.590 region:rollup2
BOND AT.

01:32:40.722 --> 01:32:44.125 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:45.960 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED THE WALL A DAT ANY

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:47.395 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH THAT IN THE STATE

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:48.596 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW AS HE TERMS OUT I

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:50.098 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE A

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:51.666 region:rollup2
PULLBACK FROM THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:32:50.098 --> 01:32:53.134 region:rollup2
HAVE PROP FIFTY ONE. ON THE

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:55.203 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER BALLOT BACK IN TWENTY

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:55.804 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN AND NINE BILLION DOLLARS

01:32:55.203 --> 01:32:57.272 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BOND.

01:32:55.804 --> 01:32:59.340 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL

01:32:57.272 --> 01:33:00.408 region:rollup2
BOND ON THIS BALLOT IN ADDITION

01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.575 region:rollup2
TO THE WATER BOND.

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:02.977 region:rollup2
AND.

01:33:00.575 --> 01:33:04.846 region:rollup2
.

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:06.147 region:rollup2
AND I THINK BEG THE QUESTION OF

01:33:04.846 --> 01:33:07.682 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZING THIS DEBT GOING

01:33:06.147 --> 01:33:09.784 region:rollup2
FORWARD IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:10.885 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T DONE THAT. FOR EXAMPLE

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:12.053 region:rollup2
IS WATER MORE IMPORTANT HIGH

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:13.421 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL.

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:15.156 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:16.891 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO ASK THAT I DON'T

01:33:15.156 --> 01:33:19.127 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE ADDRESSING.

01:33:16.891 --> 01:33:21.229 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS AN APPROPRIATE USE

01:33:19.127 --> 01:33:22.630 region:rollup2
I THINK OF EXPENDITURES IN A

01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:24.365 region:rollup2
WATER BOND I THINK.

01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:26.401 region:rollup2
THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ASPECTS

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:27.469 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THIS BOND AS WELL AS

01:33:26.401 --> 01:33:29.671 region:rollup2
PROP SIXTY EIGHT IS INCREDIBLY

01:33:27.469 --> 01:33:31.573 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:33:29.671 --> 01:33:33.475 region:rollup2
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

01:33:31.573 --> 01:33:35.643 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT

01:33:33.475 --> 01:33:36.177 region:rollup2
NOW TODAY COULD YOU LACK ACCESS

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:37.178 region:rollup2
TO CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:39.180 region:rollup2
WATER.

01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:41.316 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS IMPORTANT AND YOU

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:42.617 region:rollup2
KNOW BOND FUNDS SHOULD BE USED

01:33:41.316 --> 01:33:43.952 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WHERE CERTAINLY IN

01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:46.354 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT WITH AWKWARDNESS TALK

01:33:43.952 --> 01:33:47.589 region:rollup2
ON THAT PLANE. BOND FUNDS SHOULD

01:33:46.354 --> 01:33:48.356 region:rollup2
BE USED TO HELP PROVIDE

01:33:47.589 --> 01:33:50.358 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLEAN

01:33:48.356 --> 01:33:51.759 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER THAT'S A VERY

01:33:50.358 --> 01:33:53.328 region:rollup2
SMALL PROPORTION OF THIS BUDGET

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:53.661 region:rollup2
OF THIS BOND.

01:33:53.328 --> 01:33:55.230 region:rollup2
AND.

01:33:53.661 --> 01:33:56.798 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT NEEDS TO

01:33:55.230 --> 01:33:58.099 region:rollup2
BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE'RE

01:33:56.798 --> 01:34:00.635 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT PRIORITIZATION OF

01:33:58.099 --> 01:34:00.902 region:rollup2
BUYING THAT. AND MEMBERS FINALLY

.

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:05.807 region:rollup2
THE OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE.

01:34:03.972 --> 01:34:07.876 region:rollup2
IS.

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:09.711 region:rollup2
THE ASPECT OF MONEY FOR THE

01:34:07.876 --> 01:34:11.746 region:rollup2
CENTRAL VALLEY WATER PROJECT.

01:34:09.711 --> 01:34:13.314 region:rollup2
THAT'S NEARLY TEN PERCENT OF

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:14.449 region:rollup2
THIS BOND AND I THINK THE

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:16.417 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE AUSTIN

01:34:14.449 --> 01:34:18.052 region:rollup2
AND POSED.

THIS MATTER OF STATEWIDE CONCERN

01:34:22.524 --> 01:34:26.528 region:rollup2
AND SHOULD BE FUNDED BY STATE

01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:28.296 region:rollup2
BOND OR DIRECTLY BY.

01:34:26.528 --> 01:34:29.931 region:rollup2
WATER AGENCY REPAIRS WHO WOULD

VALLEY.

01:34:34.836 --> 01:34:38.973 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SHOULD PROBABLY BE

01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:40.608 region:rollup2
TARGETED TO PAY FOR THAT MORE

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:41.809 region:rollup2
THAN STATE TAXPAYERS GENERALLY.

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:43.211 region:rollup2
AND MINISTER GALLAGHER BROUGHT

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:44.746 region:rollup2
