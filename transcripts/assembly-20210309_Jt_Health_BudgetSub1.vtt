00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:59.317
BENEFICIARY- A FEW EXAMPLES- TO

00:31:59.384 --> 00:32:01.119
JUST NOTE. ON THE LIST OF

FEDERAL DOLLARS ON THE TABLE

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:46.497

THIS LEVEL OF FINANCIAL RISK

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:33.944

WHICH FRANKLY CAN SERVE AS A

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:23.660
BARRIER TO CARE ESPECIALLY WHEN

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:26.764

THIS AND I THINK THAT IS PART

00:52:33.783 --> 00:52:36.019
OF THE GOAL OF KILLING. AND

00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:37.587
THEN CLARIFYING THAT CHILDREN

A LONG STANDING CONCERN OF OURS

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:56.473
CRITERIA TO GET THOSE SERVICES.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.575

SCREENING IS CRITICALLY

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:09.686
IMPORTANT AS WE ALL KNOW TRUMP

HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE

00:53:11.621 --> 00:53:13.189

CALUMET ICAL ASSESS CITY NEEDS

00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:30.307
SOME CLARIFICATION. SO THERE

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:31.875
THERE NEEDS TO BE CLEAR PLAN

00:53:31.942 --> 00:53:34.444

THE SERVICES THEY NEED WHEN

THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL

OF BENEFIT OR THE SAME TYPES OF

USE EXPANDING ACCESS TO MENTAL

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.533

MANAGED CARE PLANS AGAIN

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:03.306

SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH.

00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:09.980
SECONDLY THE ONGOING ACCESS IS

00:54:10.046 --> 00:54:11.581
STILL AN ISSUE FOR US- WE KNOW

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:13.617
THAT UPS CITY COMPLIANCE IS

00:54:13.683 --> 00:54:14.684
REALLY STILL IS A MAJOR

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:16.620
CONCERN. AND THAT THE

00:54:16.686 --> 00:54:18.521
PENETRATION RATES IN CALIFORNIA

00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:19.956
ARE VERY LOW FOR SPECIALTY

00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:22.425
MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS. AND SO WE

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:24.194
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS CAN

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.462
GET ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT

SYSTEMS. SO WHAT OF THE

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:36.840
CAPACITIES OF THE SYSTEM HAS

00:54:36.906 --> 00:54:38.975
CURRENTLY TO MEET THOSE ONGOING

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:41.044

SO JUST A FEW COMMENTS ON THE

00:55:10.306 --> 00:55:13.476
TRAILER BILL ITSELF- WE DO NOT

THAT WE THINK IS THE BEST

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:31.394
PRACTICE OR OR PROPRIOCEPTION

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:34.397

00:55:36.966 --> 00:55:38.468
THAT SAYS THIS CAN BE CHANGED

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:40.036
BASED ON YOU KNOW ALL MEDICAL

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:41.037

TRANSPARENCY AND WE THINK THAT

00:55:58.054 --> 00:55:59.656

I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:12.788
ARE BIFURCATED SYSTEM THAT WE

01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:15.023
HAVE CREATED OVER MANY YEARS

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:16.425
INCLUDING THIS CARVE OUT OF

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.160
SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH HAS

01:18:18.226 --> 01:18:19.895
CAUSED THERE TO BE A LOT OF

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:21.263
CONFUSION ABOUT WHO WOULDN'T

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:23.365
EXACTLY HOLD THE RESPONSIBILITY

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:25.600
FOR WHAT. AND I THINK THAT THE

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:27.702
MANAGED CARE PLANS CLEARLY HAVE

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.905
AN EXPANDED ROLE STARTING IN

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:30.772
TWENTY FOURTEEN AS A RESULT OF

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:32.307
THE PORTABLE CARE ACT WHICH IS

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:33.875
MAYBE CREATED ADDITIONAL

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:36.011
CONFUSION BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE

01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:37.579
AN EXPANDED BENEFIT THAT REALLY

01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:38.914
WAS INTENDED FOR THE ADULT

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:42.484
EXPANSION POPULATION TRYING TO

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:43.351
BE APPLIED TO KIDS. AND I THINK

01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:46.154
WHERE WE ARE NOW IS THAT. WE

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:47.989
ENDED UP WITH AND AS I WAS

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:49.224
TALKING ABOUT IN MY TESTIMONY

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:50.992
AND IMPAIRMENT SORT OF FOCUS

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:53.028
SO. KIDS AND THERE'S ALL

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:53.462
THERE'S ALL STRONG

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:55.497
MISUNDERSTANDING THAT MILD TO

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:56.898
MODERATE AND IT'S OFTEN

01:18:56.965 --> 01:18:57.999
REFERRED TO AS A MILD TO

01:18:58.066 --> 01:18:59.768
MODERATE BENEFIT FOR EXAMPLE ON

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:01.670
THE MANAGED CARE PLAN SIDE.

01:19:01.736 --> 01:19:03.805
THAT THAT IS THE ONLY BENEFIT

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:04.873
AVAILABLE TO CHILDREN WHICH IS

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.775
NOT TRUE. CHILDREN ARE ARE

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:08.310
ENTITLED TO NECESSARY SERVICES

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:09.377
TO CORRECT AMELIORATED

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:11.413
CONDITION PERIOD. AND SO

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.747
WHETHER IT'S A SPECIALTY MENTAL

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:13.782
HEALTH SIDE WHERE THERE'S A LOT

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:15.450
MORE SERVICES AVAILABLE OR

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:16.518
WHETHER IT'S THE MANAGED CARE

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.687
PLAN. THAT SHOULD NOT MATTER TO

01:19:18.753 --> 01:19:20.522
A CHILD OR FAMILY IT SHOULD BE

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:21.990
BOTH OF YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE TO

FIGURE OUT WHO HAS TO PROVIDE

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:29.664
WHAT. I THINK THIS IS WHY SOME

01:19:29.731 --> 01:19:31.299
OF THE CHANGES THAT I ALLUDED

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:33.502
TO IN THE CALIPERS ARE HELPFUL.

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:35.203
IN THAT IT DOES MAKE IT MORE

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:37.205
CLEAR YOU KNOW A CHILD CAN GET

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:39.241

EVEN IF IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE IN

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:41.710
THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:43.445
SYSTEM. IF IT'S MEDICALLY

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:45.647

IN. WELL ACTUALLY TOLD US ABOUT

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.625
A HUNDRED AND- EIGHTY MILLION

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:19.694
DOLLARS I BELIEVE IN A NUMBER

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:23.698

FORTUNATELY SO- IT IT IMPACTS

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:37.879
HOW WE ACTUALLY- DETERMINE. OUR

01:23:37.946 --> 01:23:39.647

RIGHT NOW IS REALLY EMBEDDED

01:23:43.885 --> 01:23:45.820
THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM WE

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:47.489
CAN'T EVEN SUBMIT A CLAIM

LITTLE BIT BECAUSE- BUT- I

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.797
THINK THAT THE FORM PART IS

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:58.333
THAT WE DO NEED TO MAKE IT

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.736

01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:26.961
NICE FIRST TO BE ABLE TO ENROLL

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:28.630
THE PERSON IN THAT GROUP. AND

01:24:28.696 --> 01:24:30.064
BE ABLE TO THAT UNTIL WE WERE

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:31.266

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:44.179
ALWAYS HAVING TO SET ASIDE A

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:46.381
RESERVE. FOR CLAIMS FOR SEVERAL

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:48.316
YEARS AGO AS A GUARD AGAINST

JUST LOOKS WEIRD THAT THERE'S

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:22.784
MONEY SHOWING UP AND THEN HOW

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:25.053
HOW DO WE ACTUALLY. PLAN FOR

THE CPT AND AN FIX CODE DO NOT

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:00.080
CONTAIN CODES ADEQUATELY COVER

01:47:00.147 --> 01:47:02.215
HERE ORDER ASIAN COORDINATION

01:47:02.282 --> 01:47:04.251
CASE MANAGEMENT TRANSITION OF

CLEARLY ABOUT HOW THE CODES

01:47:09.389 --> 01:47:11.124
WILL TRANSLATE TO THE WORK THAT

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:12.692
PROVIDERS NEED TO BUILD FOR IS

01:47:12.759 --> 01:47:15.529
DESIRED. AS IT RELATES TO

01:47:15.595 --> 01:47:16.730
REIMBURSEMENT RATES MY

01:47:16.797 --> 01:47:18.165
COLLEAGUES ON THIS PANEL HAVE

01:47:18.231 --> 01:47:19.633
DESCRIBED AND COMMENTED ON THE

01:47:19.699 --> 01:47:21.334
PROSPECTIVE REIMBURSEMENT RATE

01:47:21.401 --> 01:47:23.837
METHODOLOGY. THE PROS INCLUDE

01:47:23.904 --> 01:47:25.172
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE

01:47:25.238 --> 01:47:27.607
FUNDING FOR REINVESTMENT AND

01:47:27.674 --> 01:47:29.509
VALUE BASED INCENTIVE PAYMENTS

01:47:29.576 --> 01:47:31.945
AND ARCHIVE. WELL PROVIDERS ARE

01:47:32.012 --> 01:47:32.879
EXCITED ABOUT THESE PROPOSED

01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:34.981
CHANGES FOR CLARITY IS NEEDED

01:47:35.048 --> 01:47:36.283
ABOUT THE PROCESS OF

01:47:36.349 --> 01:47:38.652
TRANSITIONING FROM THE CURRENT

01:47:38.718 --> 01:47:40.654
POPS UP ENFORCEMENT METHODOLOGY

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.988
TO A PAYMENT STRUCTURE THAT

01:47:42.055 --> 01:47:43.523
SUPPORTS A RATE SETTING

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:47.227
STRUCTURE BASED ON ACTUAL COSTS.

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:49.095
SO IN THEORY. TO A NEW

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:50.530
STRUCTURE SHOULD BE A WIN WIN

01:47:50.597 --> 01:47:52.165
HOWEVER THERE ARE QUESTIONS

01:47:52.232 --> 01:47:54.000
ABOUT THE LEAN WEIGHT COUNTIES

01:47:54.067 --> 01:47:55.569
MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING

01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:56.670
UNITS AND HOW BEST THAT WOULD

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:58.638
BENEFIT COMMUNITY BASED

01:47:58.705 --> 01:48:01.107
ORGANIZATIONS. SO THE FUNDING

01:48:01.174 --> 01:48:03.076
FOR THE STATE TO THE COUNTY AND

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:05.445
THE COUNTY TO THE CVS. IS

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:07.180
CONCERNED IT CLEAR DIRECTION

01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:08.715
HAS NOT PROVIDED AND WE HOPE

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:10.650
THAT APPROPRIATE. AND THEN

01:48:10.717 --> 01:48:12.752
TRAINING THERE IS SO MUCH

01:48:12.819 --> 01:48:14.287
EXCITING CHANGE AND PROVIDERS

01:48:14.354 --> 01:48:16.156
ARE JUST REALLY HUNGRY FOR IT.

01:48:16.223 --> 01:48:17.090
I'M MORE HOPEFUL THAT

01:48:17.157 --> 01:48:18.992
COMPREHENSIVE AND INTENSIVE

01:48:19.059 --> 01:48:20.627
TRAINING WILL BE PROVIDED TO

01:48:20.694 --> 01:48:22.128
HELP THESE ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL

01:48:22.195 --> 01:48:24.331
UNDERSTAND HOW TO OPERATE IN

01:48:24.397 --> 01:48:26.099
THIS REFORM PAYMENT SYSTEM

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:27.901
BETTER STATUS IS FINDING.

01:48:27.968 --> 01:48:30.170
OVERALL THIS PROPOSAL WILL WORK

01:48:30.237 --> 01:48:32.372
IF IT IS OPERATIONALIZE WELL

01:48:32.439 --> 01:48:34.474
PROVIDERS LARGEST CONCERNS OR

01:48:34.541 --> 01:48:36.243
ABOUT THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY

01:48:36.309 --> 01:48:37.444
FOR EXAMPLE HOW THE

01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:38.879
REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE STATE TO

01:48:38.945 --> 01:48:39.713
THE COUNTY IS GOING TO

01:48:39.779 --> 01:48:41.081
TRANSLATE TO PAYMENTS TO

01:48:41.147 --> 01:48:42.649
PROVIDERS. WE BELIEVE IT'S

01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:45.018
CRITICAL TO ENSURE WHEN PAYMENT

01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:46.953
FLOWS DOWNHILL THAT IT MEETS

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:48.889
THE PROVIDER GROWTH NEEDS TO

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:51.124
ONLY SERVE OUR COMMUNITY. IF

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:52.292
THE SYSTEM IS IMPLEMENTED

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:54.027
CORRECTLY IT IS A GREAT

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:55.729
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE BEYOND A

01:48:55.795 --> 01:48:58.231
FOCUS ON JUST PRODUCTIVITY AND

01:48:58.298 --> 01:49:00.367
INSTEAD FOCUS ON OUTCOMES AND

01:49:00.433 --> 01:49:02.202
QUALITY PROVISION OF CARE WHICH

01:49:02.269 --> 01:49:03.970
ARE CORE TENETS OF A WELL RUN

01:49:04.037 --> 01:49:06.106
SYSTEM. AIMED AT PROVIDING THE

01:49:06.172 --> 01:49:07.540
BEST BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE

CALIFORNIA. SO WE LOOK FORWARD

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:11.011
TO CONTINUING AGENT WITH THE

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:12.846
STATE AND ARE COUNTY PARKHURST

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:14.514
ASSETS PROPOSAL TAKE SHAPE.

01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:20.987

01:49:32.399 --> 01:49:34.301
OFTEN HEAR FROM MENTAL HEALTH

01:49:34.367 --> 01:49:35.201
PROVIDERS IN THE MEDICARE

01:49:35.268 --> 01:49:36.803
SYSTEM IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:40.273
THEY SPEND- TREATING THE CHART-

01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:41.241
RATHER THAN TREATING THE

01:49:41.308 --> 01:49:43.109
PATIENT SO HOW DID THE HOW DOES

01:49:43.176 --> 01:49:45.211
THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

01:49:45.278 --> 01:49:48.148
FOR MEDICO WE COMPARE TO OTHER

01:49:48.214 --> 01:49:51.418
THIRD PARTY PAYORS. THANK YOU

01:49:51.484 --> 01:49:54.554
DOCTOR. IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:49:54.621 --> 01:49:55.455
ONE AND ONE OF OUR BIGGEST

01:49:55.522 --> 01:49:57.757
PRIORITY THIS YEAR- BURDENSOME

01:49:57.824 --> 01:50:00.293
PAPERWORK- REALLY DISCOURAGES

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.062
FOLKS FROM- ENGAGING IN THE

01:50:02.128 --> 01:50:03.196
FIELD AND PROVIDING THE

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:05.198
TREATMENT THAT THEY STUDY FOR

01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:07.734
SO LONG- SO THAT'S AND REALLY

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:10.103
IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO LOOK

01:50:10.170 --> 01:50:12.906
AT- I THINK. EIGHT TO THIRD

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:15.675
PARTY HERE'S I'M NOT QUITE SURE

01:50:15.742 --> 01:50:16.576
THE MECHANISMS AND HOW IT

01:50:16.643 --> 01:50:18.011
RELATES BUT I DO KNOW THAT

01:50:18.078 --> 01:50:19.679
YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA SHE HAS

01:50:19.746 --> 01:50:22.082
BEEN SO BIG THAT OUR

01:50:22.148 --> 01:50:24.384
ASSOCIATION HAS- COMMISSION TO

01:50:24.451 --> 01:50:25.719
STUDY AND WE FOUND THAT

01:50:25.785 --> 01:50:27.654
COMPARED TO YOU. MASSACHUSETTS

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:29.589
NEW YORK- AND SOME OTHER STATES

01:50:29.656 --> 01:50:31.992
THAT WE HAVE FIVE TIMES THE

01:50:32.058 --> 01:50:34.661
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. IT TAKES FIVE

01:50:34.728 --> 01:50:36.896
TIMES AS LONG FOR CLINICIANS TO

01:50:36.963 --> 01:50:38.465
COMPLETE THE PAPERWORK REQUIRED

01:50:38.531 --> 01:50:39.899
IN CALIFORNIA AND WE KNOW THAT

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:41.201
THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM

01:50:41.267 --> 01:50:43.570
COUNTY TO COUNTY. SO FOR MEMBER

01:50:43.636 --> 01:50:44.771
AGENCIES THAT JUST HAPPENED ONE

01:50:44.838 --> 01:50:47.507
AGENCY IN ONE AREA THEY HAVE TO

01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:48.775
WORK WITH THEIR COUNTY INDIA

01:50:48.842 --> 01:50:50.577
SET OF PAPERWORK BUT FOR MANY

01:50:50.643 --> 01:50:51.644
OF OUR PROVIDER AGENCIES THAT

01:50:51.711 --> 01:50:54.080
HAVE- ENTITIES ACROSS SEVERAL

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:55.682
COUNTIES. IT LOOKS DIFFERENT IN

01:50:55.749 --> 01:50:57.684
LA IT LOOKS DIFFERENT AND SANTA

01:50:57.751 --> 01:50:59.686
CLARA LOOKS DIFFERENT. ON AND

01:50:59.753 --> 01:51:01.654
ON AND ON SO THAT IS AN ISSUE

01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:02.989
THAT CONTINUES TO PLAGUE US

01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:03.890
THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING ON

01:51:03.957 --> 01:51:09.496
LEGISLATION FOR THIS. ISSUE

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:10.430
THIS YEAR- AND WE REALLY DO

01:51:10.497 --> 01:51:11.464
HOPE THAT WERE ABLE TO YOU WORK

01:51:11.531 --> 01:51:13.400
OUR PARTNERS AT EAST. AND ARE

01:51:13.466 --> 01:51:15.635
STEPS TO FIGURE THIS OUT. THANK

01:51:15.702 --> 01:51:17.637
YOU VERY MUCH. FOR COSTS SO

01:51:17.704 --> 01:51:19.873
THIS QUESTION IS- KIND OF

01:51:19.939 --> 01:51:21.641
FOLLOW UP TO THAT AND THAT'S IS

01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:24.611
TO- THE DEPARTMENT. SO BECAUSE

01:51:24.677 --> 01:51:25.712
ONE OF THE PERSISTENT PROBLEMS

01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:27.814
WE HEAR IS ABOUT THE ERROR IS

01:51:27.881 --> 01:51:29.616
ABOUT DOCUMENTATION INVOKED THE

01:51:29.682 --> 01:51:31.785
LACK OF FINALITY. DUE TO THE

01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:33.520
MULTI YEAR RECONCILIATION

01:51:33.586 --> 01:51:35.622
PROCESS. SO I DON'T NECESSARILY

01:51:35.688 --> 01:51:36.723
SEE ANYTHING THE TRAILER BILL

01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:38.958
LANGUAGE OF THAT ELIMINATES

01:51:39.025 --> 01:51:42.028
DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS- CAN

01:51:42.095 --> 01:51:45.965
YOU SPEAK TO THAT- SO ACTUALLY

01:51:46.032 --> 01:51:48.334
WITHIN THE TRAILER BILL- WE DO

01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:50.303
HAVE SOME NOTWITHSTANDING I

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.905
REGULATION PIECES A LOT OF

01:51:51.971 --> 01:51:53.440
THOSE HISTORICAL AND VERY

01:51:53.506 --> 01:51:55.542
OUTDATED- DOCUMENTATION

01:51:55.608 --> 01:51:57.177
REQUIREMENTS ARE IN THE

01:51:57.243 --> 01:51:58.411
REGULATIONS THAT WERE PROPOSING

01:51:58.478 --> 01:52:00.947
TO YOU- REMOVED- WITHIN THE

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:03.183
CALLING- TRAILER BILL SO I

01:52:03.249 --> 01:52:04.217
THINK THAT WOULD BE ONE THING

01:52:04.284 --> 01:52:06.152
TO NOTE. I ALSO WOULD KNOW AS

01:52:06.219 --> 01:52:09.122
WE- EXPLORED CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:10.990
COUNTIES WE LEARNED THAT A LOT

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:12.759
OF THOSE ARE NOT WITHIN ACTUAL

01:52:12.826 --> 01:52:14.661
ARE REGULATION OR EVEN STATE

01:52:14.727 --> 01:52:17.464
LAW- TODAY HOWEVER HAVE BEEN

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:20.066
PUT IN PLACE- DUE TO PROTECTING

01:52:20.133 --> 01:52:22.102
THEMSELVES FROM HISTORICAL

01:52:22.168 --> 01:52:24.971
AUDIT. REPORTS OR PAY BACK ON

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:26.773
THAT HAS. YOU KNOW RESULTED IN

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.541
DOWNSTREAM REQUIREMENTS TO

01:52:28.608 --> 01:52:31.744
PROVIDERS- AMY DO YOU NEED TO

01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:34.214
PROTECT PROVIDERS AGAINST THAT

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:35.548
BUT IN THE MEANTIME THAT'S WHY

01:52:35.615 --> 01:52:36.783
IT'S THAT. YOU KNOW THE

01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:38.384
COMBINATION OF ALL THE CALIBER

01:52:38.451 --> 01:52:39.886
PUZZLE TOGETHER BOTH MEDICAL

01:52:39.953 --> 01:52:43.056
NECESSITY- AND PAYMENT REFORM

01:52:43.123 --> 01:52:44.891
ARE VERY CRITICAL TO ALL GO

01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:46.693
TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE FACT

01:52:46.759 --> 01:52:48.161
THAT THEY REALLY IMPACT BOTH

01:52:48.228 --> 01:52:50.096
THE DOCUMENTATION SIDE. I'M AS

01:52:50.163 --> 01:52:51.865
WELL AS THE EXPECTATIONS THERE

01:52:51.931 --> 01:52:54.601
AND SO- WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE

01:52:54.667 --> 01:52:55.969
SURE THAT AS WE START ROLLING

01:52:56.035 --> 01:52:57.403
THESE OUT THAT COUNTIES DON'T

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:58.538
PUT THOSE SAME TYPES OF

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:00.206
REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE FROM

01:53:00.273 --> 01:53:03.042
AUDITING- AND OTHER THINGS THAT

01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:04.344
HAVE HAPPENED. AND THAT'S WHY

01:53:04.410 --> 01:53:06.212
WHICH WHAT YOU JUST MISS CLARK

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:08.148
WAS JUST SPEAKING TO IS REALLY

01:53:08.214 --> 01:53:09.315
WHY YOU SEE IT CHANGE FROM

01:53:09.382 --> 01:53:10.617
COUNTY TO COUNTY TO DIFFERENT

01:53:10.683 --> 01:53:11.784
COUNTIES HAVE PUT IN DIFFERENT

01:53:11.851 --> 01:53:12.819
REQUIREMENTS TO DIFFERENT

01:53:12.886 --> 01:53:14.420
PROVIDERS BASED ON THEIR

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:16.589
HISTORICAL FINDINGS IN AUDIT-

01:53:16.656 --> 01:53:18.391
AND REIMBURSEMENT PIECES AND SO

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:20.360
WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS THAT- WE

01:53:20.426 --> 01:53:22.028
DO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE NOT

01:53:22.095 --> 01:53:23.730
I'M PUTTING THAT BURDEN ON A

01:53:23.796 --> 01:53:25.632
DOWNSTREAM PROVIDERS- BUT DO

01:53:25.698 --> 01:53:27.233
YOU THINK THAT IT IT HAS BEEN

01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:28.768
PUT IN PLACE OVER MANY MANY

01:53:28.835 --> 01:53:31.437
YEARS BECAUSE OF- THE DEED THE

01:53:31.504 --> 01:53:33.106
AUDITING AND THE THEIR

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:38.411
EQUIPMENT THAT HAVE BEEN. PUT

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:39.012
IN PLACE ON THOSE COUNTIES AS

01:53:39.078 --> 01:53:40.046
WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:42.182
RESEARCHER OF COURSE THANK YOU

01:53:42.248 --> 01:53:44.551
DR WERE LIKE AND IF WE WAS

01:53:44.617 --> 01:53:45.785
GONNA ASK OF YOU TO QUEST BUT

01:53:45.852 --> 01:53:47.387
IT BECOMES A BIT RHETORICA

01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:49.522
BECAUSE YOU ANSWERED IN OUR
