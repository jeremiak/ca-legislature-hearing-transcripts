FAILED TO SHOW UP FOR SHIFT

02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:07.944
BECAUSE RANDY RICHEST ATHLETES

02:53:08.010 --> 02:53:10.246
AT A FELON SHE WAS ALWAYS THERE

02:53:10.313 --> 02:53:14.050

SILVER LINING OF COVE IT WAS

02:53:33.336 --> 02:53:33.870
THAT HE GOT TO SPEND MORE TIME

02:53:33.936 --> 02:53:46.282

EQUALLY EXCITED TO MEET HIM

02:54:15.278 --> 02:54:15.812
BECAUSE SHE TALKED TO HER FOR

02:54:15.878 --> 02:54:19.048
