WELCOME. GOOD MORNING MARCELLA RUIZ -- CHIEF WITH THE IMMIGRATION REFUGEE PROGRAMS BRANCH IN THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THANK YOU. CAN JOHNSON DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES DEPUTY DIRECTOR THANK YOU HELLO JENNY BELLA LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU FINANCE. SYDNEY TAMAKO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- SO ONCE YOU GO AHEAD AND BEGIN AND I THINK WE HAVE. SO FOR THE OVERVIEW WE DID HAVE THREE QUESTIONS -- FOR THAT WE HAVE A GOOD WRITE UP SO BASICALLY SITTING THE HIGHLIGHTS THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN SENATOR STONE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE THIS MORNING AND TALK ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES -- THE THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS ASKED FOR FOR AN OVERVIEW AS YOU PROBABLY ARE AWARE WE ARE CURRENTLY ADMINISTERING TO ONGOING LEGAL SERVICES IMMIGRATION PROGRAMS ONE CALIFORNIA OR IMMIGRATION SERVICES FUNDING AND THE UNACCOMPANIED UNDOCUMENTED MINOR PROGRAM. THE ONE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM IS A FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THIS CURRENT YEAR WE ARE FINDING ONE HUNDRED AND ONE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO DELIVER LEGAL SERVICES. THE UNACCOMPANIED UNDOCUMENTED MINOR PROGRAM WHERE YOU U. M. PROGRAM IS IN ITS FIFTH YEAR IT'S A THREE MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION AND TO DATE HAS SERVED OVER THREE THOUSAND UNACCOMPANIED MINORS WITH. REPRESENTATION FOR LEGAL SERVICES WERE ALSO ADMINISTERS ADMINISTERING SEVERAL ONE TIME -- INVESTMENTS INCLUDING DOC LEGAL SERVICES LEGAL SERVICES FOR BENEFICIARIES OF TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS UNACCOMPANIED MINORS AND AND OTHER MINERS A REMOVAL DEFENSE AND AND OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH WE WILL DISCUSS LATER ON IN OUR COMMENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS PROPOSING TO MAKE ALL OF THE ONE TIME LEGAL SERVICES INVESTMENTS ONGOING BRINGING THE TOTAL INVESTMENT FOR LEGAL SERVICES TWO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THE COMMITTEE HAS ASKED US TO ADDRESS THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND AND AND CHALLENGES AND ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM IN THE LAST YEAR. AND I WOULD SAY THAT CERTAINLY AND OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE IS EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE THAT LEADS TO THE NATURALIZATION. OBTAINING A GREEN CARD RELEASE FROM DETENTION THAT LEADS TO FAMILY BEING YOU RE UNIFIED ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND SAFETY AND SECURITY. FOR FOR IMMIGRANTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAM NINETY TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS HAVE RECEIVED SERVICES FOR NATURALIZATION. TWO TWENTY THOUSAND FOUR FOUR GREEN CARD STATUS IN OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS AS IMMIGRANTS -- ANOTHER GREAT SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENT HAS BEEN THE DOC A PROGRAM -- WHICH WAS A ONE TIME INVESTMENT MADE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND JUST ENDED AND AND AND MARCH OF THIS YEAR. THROUGH THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT -- OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS PERSISTED WITH THE RENEWAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDING SIXTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVED ASSISTANCE WITH -- USCIS FILING FEES. LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO BEEN INVOLVED WITH A NUMBER OF PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE HELPED IMPROVE AND EXPAND THE ACCESS FOR START IMMIGRANTS INCLUDING VETERANS WHO ARE FACING DEPORTATION. OR WHO HAVE BEEN DEPORTED RATHER -- WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES INCLUDING -- THE INLAND EMPIRE AND COACHELLA THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND TO THE API COMMUNITIES BOTH IN THE BAY AREA AND IN THE LOS ON IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE CONTINUE CHALLENGES FOR FOR THE PROGRAM IS OF THE LACK OF CBO INFRASTRUCTURE MEN AND MUCH OF ROLE CALIFORNIA AND LET INLAND CALIFORNIA THE DEPARTMENT IS COMMITTED TO EXPANDING SERVICES IN THOSE REGIONS AND TO THAT END HAS MADE TARGETED INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND THE SERVICES AND UNDERSERVED REGIONS. BUT THAT IS THAT THOSE ARE LEGACY ISSUES THAT THE DEPARTMENT TRIES TO ADDRESS YEAR AFTER YEAR IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S EQUITY IN IN THE SERVICES THAT -- THAT ARE BEING RECEIVED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE THE OTHER CHALLENGES -- THE CHANGING FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW AND POLICY AND THE COMMITTEE HAS ASKED US TO SPEAK TO THIS AS WELL. SO WHEN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN ALONE WE SAW THE FORMAL AND TO THE TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS UP PROGRAM IMPACTING OVER FIFTY THOUSAND LONGTIME RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. AND A COURT INJUNCTION THAT FOLLOWED WE SAW THE FORMAL AND TO DHAKA IMPACT SEEING OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. AND VARIOUS COURT INJUNCTIONS THAT FOLLOWED. OF THE APPLICATION OF IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT HAVE LED TO FAMILY SEPARATION OF CHILDREN INCLUDING TODDLERS FROM THEIR PARENTS. AND THE COURT INJUNCTIONS THAT FOLLOWED. AND THE SIGNIFICANT PROPOSED CHANGES TO ASYLUM LAW THAT HAVE LED -- TO TO AT SOME CONFUSION AT THE BORDER ABOUT HOW ASYLUM SEEKER SHOULD SHOULD BE PROCESS AND HERE AGAIN THE COURT INJUNCTIONS THAT HAVE FOLLOWED. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE PROPOSED PUBLIC CHARGE RULE THAT COULD IMPACT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND AND AND CHILDREN. ALL OF THESE CHANGES HAVE REQUIRED THE DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO BE AS NIMBLE AND RESPONSIVE AS POSSIBLE AND HOW WE OVERSEE AND ADMINISTER THE CONTRACTS WITH OUR LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES TRYING TO CLEAR UP THE CONFUSION ABOUT THE STATUS OF SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. EVERY TIME THERE'S A NEW HEADLINE ABOUT DHAKA ANYTIME THERE'S A NEW HEADLINE ABOUT TPS. THAT BOTH CREATES UNCERTAINTY AND QUESTIONS FROM FROM THE IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO WHO HAVE THE STATUSES IN THE NEED FOR EDUCATION IN THAT REGION PERHAPS A LEGAL REVIEW OF ALL OF THOSE CASES SO THAT IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE. FOR FOR BOTH THE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND FOR FOR THE PROGRAM. AND AND FINALLY I WOULD ADD TO THAT THE GREATEST CHALLENGES PERHAPS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A PRETTY ROBUST IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION POLICY AGENDA. AND BALANCING THE RESPONSIVENESS TO THE TO THE DIRECTION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS IS -- TAKING WITH IT WITH IMMIGRANTS AND CALIFORNIA'S AGENDA IS THAT IS ANOTHER AS ANOTHER CHALLENGE WE ARE TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE IN ENSURING THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE DRIVING THE PROGRAM IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE THE POLICIES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ENACTED -- ARE ASKING US TO WILL ALSO TRY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE CHANGES IN FEDERAL POLICY. AND ALSO UP THERE TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS OR WE CAN ALSO SPEAK TO THE RAPID RESERVE FUND AT THIS POINT. SURE AND MAYBE DEAL IF WANTS TO START. OKAY. THE TSN HMO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THIS PROPOSAL FOREVER RESPONSES REQUESTING TWENTY MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR A RESERVE SIMILAR TO FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS. AND AND TO STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT TO GET TO THE AGENDA QUESTION WHICH I THINK WAS REALLY TRYING TO GET AN UPDATE WITH THE CURRENT YEAR FUNDING. TWO POINT TWO MILLION WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE RAPID RESPONSE RESERVES IN FEBRUARY TWO DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES WHO MY UNDERSTANDING. ON MANTA EXISTING CONTRACT WITH A JEWISH FAMILY SERVICES SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE PROVIDING. AS SERVICES AND OPERAND MARGINS THE SHELTER AT THE BORDER AND IF. I'M THRILLED FOR DEFERRED MY COLLEAGUES SPEAK MORE TO WHAT THE ACTUAL SERVICES ARE. THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES HAS HAD A CONTRACT IN PLACE WITH A JEWISH FAMILY SERVICE TO PROVIDE A RESPONSIVE SERVICES INCLUDING CASE MANAGEMENT AND NOW SHELTERING SERVICES THE TWO POINT TWO MILLION IS FOR SHELTERING SERVICES -- AND THROUGH THAT FUNDING OF THE THE JEWISH FAMILY SERVICES OPERATING A SHELTER AND I BELIEVE THEY HAVE NOW SEEN OVER SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COME THROUGH THAT SHELTER. FOR FOR SERVICES THEY ARRIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND PROCEED ON TO THE FINAL POINT OF DESTINATION. THANK YOU -- INCOMES FROM OHIO ANY FURTHER COMMENTS OR FINANCE ABOUT THE OTHER PART OF PRESENTATIONS. ALL RIGHT. OKAY -- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT ODDS AND ACTUALLY JUST IN TERMS OF SO BASICALLY IN TERMS OF THE IMMIGRATION RAPID RESPONSE -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETING -- SO YOU MENTIONED THAT LAST FALL FOR THIS CURRENT. YEAR PATROL AND IN JUNE THIRTIETH OF RIGHT NOW WITH THE USED TO A TWO POINT TWO MILLION. ONE TIME OKAY AND WE'RE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING WAS A FIVE MILLION. FOR WELL COME ON THE TRIP FIVE MILLION WAS A TWENTY MILLION A CURRENT YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS PROPOSING TWENTY MILLION HERE BUT OKAY. AND I REALIZE IT'S RAPID RESPONSE THOUGH WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN -- BUT IN TERMS OF THE THINKING FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ABOUT WHAT WE ANTICIPATE MORE ACTIVISTS ARE SEE THERE'S AN INCREASE -- THAT'S BEING PROPOSED -- BUT CERTAINLY I ALSO KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY GOING ON INCLUDING FAMILY SEPARATION -- WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW THE THE **** ASYLUM SITUATION WHICH AND SO FORTH -- SO IT'S FUNDING FOR IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHAT THE THE ANTICIPATED. ISSUES MIGHT BE ABSOLUTELY AND I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THE REFERENCE TO THIS AS A RAPPER RESPONSE FOR EMERGENCIES WERE WHICH REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL COME FORWARD AND WE WANT. TO AS THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE TO QUICKLY ADAPT ESPECIALLY WHERE FEDERAL FUNDING IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS POPULATION. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON TRAVEL TO HELP CLARIFY WHEN IT WOULD MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR THIS FUNDING AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE ONCE WE THAT BECOMES AVAILABLE. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT AND THEN IN TERMS OF I KNOW THAT OF ONE CALIFORNIA'S -- PROGRAM THAT WAS SO STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY POSTS -- THE API CAUCUS IN NINETEEN OH CAUCUS WHEN I WASN'T THE SAID CHAIR I WOULD COME AND REPRESENT THE API CAUCUS ON THAT HE SPEAK MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WORK THAT YOU'RE TRYING YOU'RE DOING WITH THE API COMMUNITY -- AND TERMS F IN TERMS OF HELPING PROVIDE IMMIGRATION SERVICES -- YOU KNOW THAT ACTUALLY OVER HALF OF ALL API WHO RESIDE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES. SO IT'S CERTAINLY A A AND I THINK IT'S THE FASTEST GROWING IMMIGRANT POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. YES THANK YOU UP. IT MY SALARIES FROM DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES -- THE APEC COMMUNITY IS IN FACT THE FASTEST GROWING UNDOCUMENTED. IMMIGRANT POPULATION IMMIGRANT POPULATION IN IN IN THE STATE AND IN SOME AREAS OF IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES MY MOM THE MOST AND REPRESENTED SO IN THE AREA OF NATURALIZATION AFFECT THE API COMMUNITY DOES NATURALIZER FAR GREATER RATE THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES BUT IN THE AREA OF DOCTOR LEGAL SERVICES ARE TAKING. ADVANTAGE OF OTHER FORMS OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF THE API COMMUNITY DOES NOT DOES NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OF THOSE -- IMMIGRATION SERVICES AS AS OTHER COMMUNITIES TOO TO THAT END WE HAVE ME TARGETED INVESTMENTS AND POT IN. IN -- ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE WORKING WITH A P. I. POPULATIONS PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND ORANGE COUNTY. AND NOW WE ARE WORKING TO PROPOSALS FOR IT FOR THE BAY AREA AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE'RE HOPING TO ADDRESS THE WRATH OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE SURFACING FOR THE API POPULATION. I MENTIONED -- THE NEED TO ENCOURAGE MORE TALKAPPLICATIONS FOR FOR THE API POPULATION BUT WERE ALSO NOW SEEING ISSUES AROUND REMOVAL. NEED FOR REMOVAL DEFENSE FOR OF REFUGEE COMMUNITY SOUTHEAST ASIAN COMMUNITIES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND AND AND THOSE. IN THE SOUTH BAY. THERE IS -- WE'RE WE'RE HOPING TO DEVELOP MORE EXPERTISE IN THE API SERVING OR EXPAND RATHER THE EXPERTISE THE EXPERTISE EXISTS BUT EXPAND THE SERVICES FOR REMOVAL DEFENSE. TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT -- API POPULATIONS. IT THAT I MEAN WE KNOW THE TEN MILLION POPULATION HAS BEEN TARGETED IN THERE. FOR NO ANSWER ANY TO PORT. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THAN THE RULING SET THAT UP AND IN AN AGREEMENT TOWARD THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PORTING -- VIETNAMESE REFUGEES WHO CAME OVER AFTER THE VIETNAM WAR AS USE -- AND THAT THE PORTING THE BACK TO VIETNAM AND DAY. NO -- SO IT'S THE DESK STREAMING CONCERNING -- AND HOPEFULLY OUR STATE CAN HELP PROVIDE -- ASSISTANCE -- THE FACE OF OF THESE TERRIBLE POLICY DECISIONS -- I GUESS THE AND AND IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT SO YOU MENTION CENTRAL VALLEY ON AND THE CBO AND I DON'T KNOW IF FOR THE API COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY LANGUAGE CAPACITY AND SO FORTH IS. IN ADDITION TO HELPING PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS FOR THE CBO'S AND AND AND AND SO FORTH -- CAPACITY BUILDING IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED -- FOR EXAMPLE LACK OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THEN I DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF THE IT GUY COMMUTERS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF LANGUAGES AND AND AND AND COMMUNITIES -- AS IT IS IS THERE A ROLE FOR I GUESS CAPACITY BUILDING AND AND THIS PROGRAM THAT -- WE NEED TO BE LOOKING MORE INTO. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY AN ELEMENT OF THE INVESTMENTS -- FOR FOR THE API POPULATION -- BUILDING CAPACITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALREADY MAY HOW THE LANGUAGE CAPACITY BUT DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE LEGAL EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE THE MORE COMPLEX SERVICES SO THAT'S ONE ELEMENT OF CAPACITY BUILDING.

FROM THE JUSTICE IN DIVERSITY CENTER THE BAR ASSOCIATION SAN FRANCISCO [inaudible] WELCOME. AND ASK IF YOU CAN. THREE MINUTES -- AND W.. WE HAVE QUESTIONS WILL GIVE YOU EVEN MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPOUND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M MY NAME IS JACKIE GONZALEZ AND THEN THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR IMMIGRANT JUSTICE. THE COLLABORATIVE IS A NETWORK OF LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FOCUS ON PROVIDING RAPID RESPONSE AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. AND AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD THIS MORNING CALIFORNIA STANDS ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S WAR ON IMMIGRANTS. WERE HOME TO THE MOST ACTIVE BORDER CROSSING IN THE WORLD AND HOME TO MORE IMMIGRANTS THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN OUR COUNTRY. AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WORD TODAY FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS OUR HOME. IMMIGRANTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOT WITHSTANDING ARE VULNERABLE TO ARBITRARY ARRESTS INHUMANE DETENTION AND DEPORTATION WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. IMMIGRATION IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX AND INVOLVING AREAS OF LAW BUT THOSE FACING DEPORTATION ARE NOT GUARANTEED ACCESS TO COUNSEL EVEN THOUGH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR CASES CAN BE YEARS IN DETENTION FAMILY SEPARATION AND ULTIMATELY EXILE FROM THIS COUNTRY. AND AS WE'VE HEARD EARLIER TODAY THE NEED FOR LEGAL SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE IS MOST URGENT IN THE RURAL REGIONS OF OUR STATE. THESE PLACES INCLUDE THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE CENTRAL COAST THESE AREAS ARE ALSO HOME TO THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS AND SOME OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS BY ICE. DEFEND OUR COMMUNITIES WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE IMMIGRATION COURT ROOMS IN OUR STATE WERE TODAY SO MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS STAND ALONE ARE ACTUALLY THE FRONT LINES OF THIS BATTLE. AND AS WE'VE HEARD AND I'M HERE TO ALSO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT THE STATE HAS MADE A REMARKABLE INVESTMENT IN LEGAL SERVICES HOWEVER. ONLY 20% OF THE FUNDING THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED HAS GONE TO REMOVAL DEFENSE SERVICES. AND THOSE DOLLARS HAVE HONESTLY BEEN LIMITED TO URBAN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE STILL ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE EXPERTISE TO ACTUALLY MAKE RESPONSIBLE USE OF THESE FUNDS. CRITICAL SUPPORT FOR THESE SERVICES IS JUST SIMPLY NOT REACHING CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS IN REMOTE AND RURAL REGIONS OF OUR STATE. AND THT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE UNLESS WE MAKE AN INVESTMENT TO GROW CAPACITY. TO YOUR EARLIER POINT MISTER CHAIR -- ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUES AND AS YOU KNOW -- BETTER THAN ME HOW ABOUT THAT THE API COMMUNITY -- THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS ALSO HOME TO A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THIS COMMUNITY SO THIS IS A PROPOSAL FOR CAPACITY BUILDING ON THIS ON THE ISSUE THAT YOU WERE. ASKING EARLIER -- SO THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT JUSTICE FELLOWSHIP IS A ONE TIME FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR ASKED TO SUPPORT A PILOT PROGRAM. IT WOULD DO SEVERAL THINGS FIRST PROVIDE THE FIRST STATE SPONSORED LEGAL FELLOWSHIP TRAINING PROGRAM TO INCREASE FOR MOBILE DEFENSE SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS SECOND. IT WOULD INCREASE WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LAW STUDENTS AND YOUNG ATTORNEYS THAT WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO RETURN HOME TO THESE AREAS OF HIGH NEED BUT REALLY HAVE NO VIABLE OPTIONS FOR DOING SO. AND FINALLY IT WILL EXPAND THE NUMBER OF REPUTABLE LEGAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ELIGIBLE TO PROVIDE THESE CRITICAL SERVICES OUR STATE. AND WHILE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BEGIN AS A PILOT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE SF IMMIGRATION COURT. IT'S NOTEWORTHY THAT THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT EXTENDS AS FAR NORTH AS OREGON BORDER AND AS FAR SOUTH AS BAKERSFIELD. SO THIS PROPOSAL -- WHAT THE EXPERTISE RICHARD IT'S OUT OF THE BAY BUT THE JURY GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSE IT COVERS IS REALLY JUST PHENOMENAL? I'M A RECENT DATASTUDY LED BY THE SAN FRANCISCO BARS SO SHOULD ASSOCIATIONS JUSTICE AND DIVERSITY CENTER FOUND THAT OF THE DETAINED. ON REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS SERVED 20% WERE ACTUALLY RECENTLY ARRIVED ASYLUM SEEKERS IN SAN FRANCISCO COURT OVER 25% WORK RESIDENTS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO -- ULTIMATELY AT AND INVESTMENT IN THIS PILOT WILL REALLY BE AN INVESTMENT FOR SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STATEWIDE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM FROM SOCIAL SERVICES ABOUT THIS. HELLO JUST NOTE THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE TARGET INVESTMENTS THAT DEPARTMENT HAS MADE WE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THE EXPANSION OF LEGAL SERVICES AND AND ROLE IN AN WHEN CALIFORNIA AND THAT -- ESPECIALLY FOR MORE COMPLEX LEGAL REPRESENTATION.

NEXT UP THANK YOU AGAIN -- SORT OF FOR BEING HERE AND SPEAING HERE THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH. OKAY FINALLY WE HAVE A SUPPLY BANK DOT ORG. AND WE HAVE SPEAKING HERE -- BENITO DELGADO OLSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. WELCOME [inaudible] EVANS. TO ASK THAT THE WE HAVE THE USUAL THREE MINUTE. OKAY BEGINNER STATEMENT -- SIZE SCREEN. OF WHAT. THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON PAN AND PROSPECTIVE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND ALSO STAFF AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DEPARTMENTS FOR ALL OF YOUR TIME LEADING UP TO TODAY -- I'M HERE TO ASK YOUR CONSIDERATION IN SUPPORT OF SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE OVER TIME WILL HELP MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS IN POVERTY. AND HELP BOOST THE WORK OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE WORK WITH THROUGH OUR FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PARTNERING AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE. TO PROVIDE DIRECT -- PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND PATHWAYS OUT OF POVERTY -- THROUGH THEIR OWN AGENCIES. MY NAME IS BENITO DELGADO OLSON AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SUPPLY BANK DOT ORG WHICH SIMPLISTICALLY IS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WOULD THINK OF IS A REGIONAL FOOD BANK BUT FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT. FOOD -- SOME HISTORY MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN TERMS OF CONTEXT IN UNDERSTANDING OUR CONCEPT FOR THOSE OF YOU. WHO HAVEN'T HEARD IT BEFORE? PRIOR TO THE FOUNDING OF THE FIRST MODERN FOOD BANK IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN THE SAME WAY MANY OF US THINK OF CO TRIES AND BACKPACK DRIES AND DIAPER DRIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WAS SIMILAR TO HOW HUNGER WAS ADDRESSED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. IS QUOTE UNQUOTE REDISCOVERED AT THAT TIME NGUYEN ENDED WHEN A GENTLEMAN IN PHOENIX ARIZONA FOUNDED WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER TO BE THE FIRST MODERN FOOD BANK WITH THE CENTRAL HUB OF PLACE TO CONCENTRATE RESOURCES IN KIND GIVING. AND PROCUREMENT TO GENERATE TREMENDOUS ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND HELP. A LOT MORE PEOPLE FOR THE SAME INVESTMENT. WE'VE BEEN BUILDING AND FOLLOWING THAT SAME MODEL FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY AGENCIES IN EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. THAT INCLUDE WICK FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION SCHOOL DISTRICTS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS EVEN FOOD BANKS -- AND MANY MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS MOST RECENTLY -- Là COOPERATIVE A COMPASS CENA AND THEIR MEMBER AGENCIES AND MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BY PROVIDING THEM WITH MATERIALS THAT THEIR CLIENTS DESPERATELY NEED AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WOULD OTHERWISE GO WITHOUT BUT BY PROVIDING THEM THROUGH THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALREADY FUNDED PROVIDE DIRECT PATHWAYS OUT OF POVERTY. TWO YEARS AGO WE CONCLUDED OF A PRETTY LENGTHY STUDY PROCESS WITH LEADERS IN PHILANTHROPY COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SOCIAL WORKERS CAO WORKS FOCUS GROUPS AND OTHER PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FOCUS GROUPS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. WITH A NUMBER OF TIMES USING KEY TAKEAWAYS. THE BIGGEST ONE WAS THE SAME THING THE CATALYZE FOOD BANKS SOME FIFTY YEARS AGO. WAS A BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITY THAT IS WHAT'S NEEDED TO CONCENTRATE RESOURCES IN KIND GIVING AND MANY OTHER -- EFFICIENCIES AND REDUCTIONS OF PRIVATE WAREHOUSING LOGISTICS COSTS THE COULD GROW A PROGRAM LIKE A SUPPLY BANK THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GOING BACK TO HISTORY WHEN THEY FIRST CREATED THAT FIRST CENTRAL HUB IN PHOENIX ARIZONA. IT WAS ONLY TEN YEARS BEFORE THE UNITED STATES WAS FUNDING EIGHTEEN MORE REGIONAL FOOD BANKS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE THE SAME MODEL OF CONCENTRATING PHILANTHROPY VOLUNTEERISM IN BUILDING TREMENDOUS ECONOMIES OF SCALE CAN WORK ANYWHERE AND THAT'S OUR SAME COLLABORATIVE GOAL HERE. UNDERSTOOD -- I WOULD ADD THE THERE'S JUST. THERE'S A VERY HUMAN SIDE TO ALL OF THIS WHICH IS THE BASIC NEEDS ARE NOT BASIC -- THAT'S ONE OF THE THE MANTRAS OF THE NATIONAL DIAPER BANK NETWORK WE WERE A PROUD PARTNER. BUT IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT -- LOCALLY. MANY OF OUR LOCAL PARTNERS THE THE MEADOW VIEW FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER RIVER OAKS FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER -- ME IN -- FIRST FIVE RIVERSIDE WE'RE STARTING -- DIAPER KID DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEIR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION FOR TEN YEARS THROUGH THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. AND THE SAME THROUGHOUT ALL OF CALIFORNIA SO -- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. I THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM LA -- NO FINANCE OKAY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. RIGHT. SO -- SO BASICALLY YOU'RE LOOKING -- FOR AT ONE TIME ALLOCATION TO BASICALLY BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THIS FROMTHE STATE. I WOULD BE ONE THIRD OF THE COST THE OTHER TWO THIRDS PHILANTHROPY IS TAKING CARE OF AND ONE MILLION WOULD BE FOR COMMERCIAL GRADE FIRE RESISTANT SHEDS FOR DISASTER RELIEF MATERIALS AND OTHER BASIC NEEDS MATERIALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OKAY. IS THAT -- FOR THE QUESTION LA -- IS. AN INTEREST I THINK THIS IS THIS SERVING USUAL FOR STATE TO PLAY THIS ROLE ARE NOT I MEAN WE CERTAINLY GIVE WE PROVIDE FUNDING FOR VARIETY OF NON PROFITS WE PARTNER WITH FOR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES STATED THAT FURTHER THE STATE'S AIMS. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK WE WE'VE SOMETIMES PROVIDE A PIECE OF THE FUNDING AND OTHER FUNDING IS RAISED THROUGH NONPROFITS WHETHER OR NOT -- FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIFICALLY THAT THE QUESTION I CAN BRING BACK TO THE FOLKS ON OUR TEAM THAT COVER MORE INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED ISSUES I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE EIGHT AND EIGHT AND AND ARE YOU PART ARE YOU'VE BEEN TAKING CONVERSATIONS ARE PARTNERING WITH -- WEBER STATE AGENCIES THE PART OF SOCIAL SERVICE SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROLE THAT. YOUR ORGANIZATION. IT OUT HOW THE COURT DATES YOUR ACTIVITIES CORNET WITH THE THE ARE CURRENTLY WE'VE COORDINATION RELATIONSHIPS -- THAT ARE ONGOING WITH CALLOW YES AS IT RELATES TO DISASTER RELIEF -- PROGRAMMATIC WITH RESPECT TO THE NINETY EIGHT TO MYSTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER AGENCIES. CONTRACTUAL AND COORDINATING WITH SO I I GUESS MORE SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET REQUESTS I I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS OF THE THE FINANCE ARE ONE THE AGENCIES ABOUT THE ROLE THAT PLACE. YES OKAY DO YOU CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE PERHAPS THE PRICES ARE THROUGH THE AD THAT THAT PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU HAS BEEN AT THE CONNECTED WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT AND I THINK PROBABLY THE MOST ASKED SIMILAR AT PROGRAMMING. PROJECT WILL BE TO OUR FOOD BANKS IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AT RESOURCES THAT WE DO THERE OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT THAT'S HELPFUL TO NOW OKAY. ALL RIGHT AND JUST JERRY IT'S ONLY DOING SOME GREAT THINGS I'M JUST I FORGET HOW THIS CONNECTS WITH THAT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STATE RESOURCES HOW COORDINATES WITH THE REST OF THE STATE'S UNDERSTANDING. ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT THE NUN SO WE'LL GO AHEAD TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS SO WE HAVE -- THREE PROPOSAL INVESTMENTS. BEFORE US HERE AGAIN WE'RE NOT TAKING VOTE ON ANY OF THEM TODAY BUT YOU. SO YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO TELL US WHICH ONE WHICH OF THE THREE REALLY LIKE ARE ALL THREE OF THEM AND SO THANK YOU AND WELCOME.

WE HAVE AGAIN HAD A YEAR TREMENDOUS DISASTER RESPONSE PARTICULARLY IN VIEW COUNTY THE PARADISE FIRE. AND OF COURSE WE STEPPED UP DURING A FEDERAL SHUTDOWN THE ISSUE BENEFITS EARLY IN AN UNPRECEDENTED. MANNER. LOOKING AHEAD THE THE HIGHLIGHT IS NO DOUBT THE EXPANSION OF COVERAGE TO SERVE OVER -- MILLION RECIPIENTS ON SSI BEGINNING JUNE FIRST COUNTING THE WEEKS NOW TO GET READY FOR THAT. BUT THREE MAJOR THEMES FOR THE YEAR AHEAD ONE CONTINUES TO BE FOOD FOR ALL MAKING SURE WE HAVE OUR LANGUAGE ACCESS DISABILITY ACCESS AND WELCOME IMMIGRANTS.

CAN YOU ACTUALLY IN TERMS OF THE EXPIRATION OF OF THE GOAT A WHAT ABLE BODIED ADULTS WITHOUT THE TENDED SO WITH THAT THE AND SO. I GUESS WHAT HAPPENED IS IS THAT -- WELL CAN IS SO BASICALLY CAN BE EXPANDED TO MORE COUNTIES BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE RECOVERY GOING ON WITH COUNTIES WILL BE WAIVED THAT'S OF YOUR ACCOUNT OF AND THAT'S A FEDERAL DECISION RIGHT. RIGHT IT'S YES SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE A WAIVER THAT EXPIRES -- IN AUGUST THIRTIETH THAT THAT PROTECTS FIFTY FIVE COUNTIES WE HAVE A WAIVER REQUEST PENDING FOR THE NEXT YEAR THAT WOULD HONEST FIFTY TWO COUNTIES AND WE SHOULD HEAR FROM LAST YEAR WE HEARD IN JULY BUT WE ARE REMINDING THEMTHAT WERE WAITING. HI BUT WE'RE PROCEEDING AS IF WE WILL HAVE THAT WAY FOR A PLACE OKAY THE WILD CARD OF COURSE IS THE FEDS HAVE A PROPOSED RULE OUT THAT JUST CLOSED FOR COMMENT. THAT WOULD REALLY RADICALLY CHANGE THE WHOLE WAIVER FRAMEWORK SO WE WILL WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE FINAL RULE IS. BUT PENDING -- NO CHANGE IN THAT AND PENDING AT THIS YEAR'S WAIVERS APPROVED LIKE LAST YEAR'S WHAT WE WE WOULD BE IMPLEMENTING THAT TIME LIMIT IN THE SIX COUNTIES OKAY STARTING IN SEPTEMBER [inaudible] AND OKAY AND AND JUST SO WHAT'S A CASE OF THE DAY THAT VERY BRIEFLY THAT THAT FEDERAL RULE CHANGE THAT THEY CLOSE THEM AND WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT AND WHEN WOULD THAT TAKE AFFECTED THEY ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH THAT AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FINAL RULE IS SO. IT'S A LITTLE BIT SPECULATION BUT RIGHT TAKING THE LAST QUESTION WAS PROPOSED A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING WAS IN JANUARY AND IF THAT THE PROPOSED RULE BECAME FINAL AS PROPOSED WOULD BE OCTOBER FIRST. THAT SEEMS ON THAT SEEMS VERY FAST. GIVEN THAT WILL MAKE IT THE THE COMMENT PERIOD JUST CLOSE THIS WEEK BECAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN PARTLY BECAUSE OF AN EXTENSION BUT NONE THE LESS IT COULD BE A QUITE FAST OUR TIME LINE. AND IT REALLY CHANGES ALL THE CRITERIA FOR WAIVER CHANGES THE ABUSE ONE APPOINTMENT DATA. TO TO JUSTIFY A WAIVER FROM THE TIME LIMIT YOU KNOW SUCH A WAY THAT ALMOST ALL OF CALIFORNIA WOULD IMMEDIATELY COME OFTEN NEED TO IMPLEMENT TIME LIMITED WORK REQUIREMENTS ESSENTIALLY ESSENTIALLY MOVED INTRSTATE OFF. YES AND THE OTHER BIG CHALLENGE FOR US IS WE HAVE A BANK OF OF MONTHS OF FOOD FROM YEARS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS THAT WOULD BE WIPED OUT. AND SO THAT'S WERE USING NOW TO HELP FAMILIES AFTER WE MAKE SURE THEY QUALIFY. WORK WITH THEM ON EMPLOYMENT SERVICES WE ALSO HAVE THIS BANK OF FOOD MONTHS -- THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD HAVE MORE PEOPLE EXPOSED TO TIME LIMITS AND FEWER TOOLS TO HELP THEM. OKAY ALL RIGHT SOMETHING.

WE'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THAT IF WE SIMPLIFY THE PROGRAM AND GET MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED WE CAN PROBABLY. INCREASE CALIFORNIA'S FEDERAL DOLLARS BY SOMETHING LIKE THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS -- WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL FOR A ONE TIME INVESTMENT FOR THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELDERLY SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION PROJECT.

ALL RIGHT SO -- OKAY. BUT BILL SHOP ON THE SIDE THERE SO OF BETWEEN THE TWO YOU THREE MINUTES AND IF YOU'VE PROP QUESTIONS YOU MAY GET CHANCE TALKING LONGER. OKAY. AN INTERCHANGE AND FROM CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS -- WANT TO BEGIN BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT SOME SITTING IN PROPOSALS IN ALREADY AND THE DENTON BUDGET INCLUDING. EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR HEALTH FOOD IN ADDITION TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR FOR CAPACITY FOR ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THE TRUCKS AND CLOSER TO FOOD BANKS. DESPERATELY NEED TO TO FEED THEIR COMMUNITIES -- ARE PROP THE PROPOSAL FOR INVESTMENT TODAY THOUGH IS TO INCREASETHE CALVET FUNDING -- FROM THE EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR LEVEL TO A TOTAL OF TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE SO THE DELTA BEING SIXTEEN SIXTEEN POINT FIVE AND ALSO TO RAISE THE STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION RATE FROM 10215%. THAT'S AND COST SEE ANYTHING ADDITIONAL WHICH IS JUST GOING TO BETTER CAPTURE THE REAL COSTS -- TO KEEP THAT FOOD FASHION AND SAFE THE JEFFERSONS BETWEEN A MOMENT. IT IS VERY BRIEFLY ON THE NEED TO BOLSTER THE EMERGENCY SAFETY NET EVEN AS WE OBVIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT CAL FRESH THE OTHER PUBLIC NUTRITION PROGRAMS ARE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST HUNGER. YOU HONESTLY JUST HAD A DISCUSSION HIT MOSTOF THOSE THOSE HIGH POINTS IN TERMS OF THE DISASTER OBVIOUSLY -- IT IS THE NEW NORMAL WHETHER IT'S FIRES OR OR FOR FLOODS -- IN IN CENTER STONE'S DISTRICT AND AN UNPRECEDENTED FEDERAL THREATS PUBLIC CHARGE A BUD THE SHUT DOWN EVEN AN AVERAGE MONTH ABOUT A THIRD OF CALPERS CLIENTS ARE STILL COMING TO FOOD BANKS BECAUSE OF WHO THEN IF IT'S ONE OUT. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THAT IS ONE HOSPITALIZATIONS MIKE WE HAVE DATA FROM DOCTOR SELIGMAN THAT SHOW THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T TAKE THE MEDICATIONS AND THEY'RE RELYING EXPENSES SERVICES SO BY CRYING NUTRITIOUS FOODS. SUCH AS TO THE CALVET PROGRAM REALLY HELPS FILL THAT GAP RENTALS BECAUSE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND AND IT NURSES ARE COMMUNITIES IN NEED THAT BY GOING TO TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION. FOOD BANKS ON THE STATE CAN REALLY LEVERAGE OUR ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT WOULD BRING A NEARLY A HUNDRED MILLION MEALS TO THOSE IN NEED AND WOULD BE MEANINGFUL STEP TO CLOSE THAT ACCOUNT AND CALIFORNIA [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M JENNIFER POSTLETHWAITE ON BEHALF OF SACRAMENTO FOOD BANK AND FAMILY SERVICES THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME AND THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN FOR YOUR CONTINUED DEDICATION TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY. SACRAMENTO FOOD BANK AND FAMILY SERVICES HAS THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING THE WIDE EXPANSE AND DIVERSE POPULATION OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY INCLUDING MOST OF DISTRICTS. SIX RIGHT NOW OVER TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ARE UNSURE OF WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL IS COMING FROM. AND THAT INCLUDES ONE OF EVERY FOUR CHILDREN. LAST YEAR'S SACRAMENTO FOOD BANK AND FAMILY SERVICES PROVIDED OVER TWENTY ONE MILLION MEALS TO NEIGHBORS IN NEED. NEARLY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION OF THOSE HEALTHY MEALS WERE THANKS TO TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM CALIPHATE. CALVET IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR EFFORTS TO FIGHT HUNGER BUT OUR NEED IS GROWING DUE TO RISING LIVING EXPENSES POVERTY IN HOMELESS RATES. AND THE CLIMATE OF FEAR THAT'S DRIVING FAMILIES AWAY FROM CAL FOR ASH. LAST YEAR'S FUNDS ENABLED US TO DISTRIBUTE HIGH QUALITY FRESH FOODS. GROWN IN CALIFORNIA LIKE BROCCOLI CABBAGE CARROTS POTATOES AND SQUASH. WE COULD TRIPLE BEST A FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION NUTRITIOUS MEALS OF OUR CALVET REQUEST IS FULLY FUNDED WITH AN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. RAISING THE STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION RIGHT 215% IS ALSO VITAL TO OUR FOOD BANK AS THE CURRENT 10% DOES NOT CAPTURE OUR COSTS TO STORE AND DISTRIBUTE THE HEALTHY PRODUCE WHILE MAINTAINING FRESHNESS AND FOOD SAFETY. DOCTOR PAN WE HOPE YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE CAN PRIORITIZE THIS MODEST FUNDING INCREASES TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND AROUND THE STATE. TO REDUCE HUNGER PREVENT EXPENSE OF HEALTH CARE COSTS AND HELP BUILD A MORE EQUITABLE FUTURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- ANY COMMENTS FROM THE FAR SOCIAL SERVICES OKAY ALEJO. FINANCE ALL RIGHT. OF FIRST OF ALL I WANNA THANK THE SEGMENT FOOD BANK IN A WE WORK WE WE WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER WE STILL WORK TOGETHER ON A LOT OF ISSUES IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS HUNGER AND I NOTE THAT -- YOUR ORGANIZATION PLAYS A VERY CENTRAL ROLE IN BE SURE THAT WE TRY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS -- RECOGNIZING THAT THE NEED IS VERY GREAT. WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO TO DO THAT SO THANK YOU -- SO ACTUALLY WITH THINGS I DO WANT TO RAMPS THREE ACTUALLY I WORKED WITH THE SEGMENT FOOD BANK TO TALK ABOUT BUILDING THE STORAGE CAPACITY RIGHT AND SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET MORE FRESH PRODUCE IN FACT I DON'T UNDERSTAND SECOND FOOD BANK ACTUALLY. TO CERTAIN DEGREE PAYS FOR SOME OF THAT PRODUCE TO I MEAN IT'S FOR IT'S EASY. TO DONATE A CAN -- IT DOESN'T GO BAD AND AND SO FORTH IT'S A LITTLE HARDER TO TAKE AND BUT THAT'S ALSO THE QUALITY FOOD YOU WANT TO GET TO THE THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY -- SO THAT IT AGAIN I KNOW YOU CAN'T TAKE A POSITION I THESE PROPOSALS BUT I MEAN THIS THIS THOUGHT ABOUT -- BEING AT HAVING -- A HIGHER PERCENTAGE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE STORAGE CAPACITY SO THAT VIçT THESE ARE BECAUSE OF FOOD BANKS CAN. CAN ACTUALLY IT -- BUILD THAT CAPACITY SO. YEAH WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WE'VE SEEN THAT INFORMATION FROM THE SURVEYS OF OUR PROVIDERS OF THE COST WHETHER IT'S THE COOLING THE STORAGE RIGHT. WE'VE SEEN THAT AND WE'RE WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT OKAY OUR IS BECAUSE I THINK THAT I MEAN THAT SOMETHING ACTUALLY I ACTUALLY URGED THE SECOND A FOOD BANK TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY COULD BUILD MORE CAPACITY SO I CAN'T. HAVE URGED THEM IN AND OUT HEALTH OUT. TRYING TO GET SAY OKAY WELL WE NEED THAT RIGHT THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT SO -- AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER -- QUESTION I HAVE IS NOW IT DOES COME PUBLIC CHARGE RATE ITSELF. AND BUT WE LOVE FOR PEOPLE AND BUT ACTUALLY NOW WOULD WE STILL WITHIN FORTY WERE STILL ON THE LOW END ON COVERAGE AND ROMAN COMPARED TO OTHER STATES RIGHT AND WE'D LOVE TO GET MORE PEOPLE ON CAL FRESH IDEALLY. BUT WE ALSO KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO DO THAT AND WHEN THEY CAN'T DO THAT. THEY'RE COMING OVER HERE TO THE FOOD BANK SO I MEAN IS IS THERE A WEEK. AND I KNOW IT'S REALLY HARD TO DO THIS BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU THIS RIGHT. FIRST PLACE AT IN TERMS OF QUANTIFYING THIS EFFECT AND AND THINKING ABOUT -- AT FORTY A WATER AND SAME WAY WE JUST HEARD ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND WE NEED SERVICES A CERTAIN DEGREE BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET THEM I CAO FRESH -- THE ROOF RIGHT AWAY FROM IT THAT WE NEED TO THAN DIRECT MORE RESOURCES TO OTHER APPROACH LIKE FOOD BANKS. I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THE CAL OF ACCOUNT FRESH SIDE LET YEAH I CALLED RIGHT THE BANK SIDE BUT YES -- WELL CALPERS REMAINS IT IS NOT A PUBLIC CHARGE AT THIS POINT AND IF AND WHEN THAT RULE BECOMES FINAL. FIVE WHICH WAS AS PROPOSED CAL FRESH FOR SOME IMMIGRANTS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES NONE THE LESS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A CHILLING EFFECT ON AND IN OUR DATA WE CAN SEE. THAT BEGINNING IN EARLY. TWENTY SEVENTEEN CALPERS TRENDS BY PEOPLE WHO REQUESTED MATERIALS IN SPANISH CALPERS CASELOADS ARE FALLING FASTER. THAN CALPERS TRIMS ALIVE -- CASES OF PEOPLE WHO THEIR LANGUAGE AND ENGLISH AS A NEW TREND FOR US AND IT'S CONTINUED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THROUGH PRESENT SO. THAT WOULD SUGGEST IN THERE AGAIN THERE MAYBE DEMOGRAPHIC REASONS OR OTHER ISSUES AS WELL BUT THAT DIFFERENCE BY LANGUAGE SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SUGGESTS THERE HAS BEEN A CHILLING EFFECT. OKAY INCOMES AND WOULD JUST ECHO THE ACT WITH THE SAME ON THE ONLY THING WE WOULD SAY IN ADDITION OR TO IS THAT THERE'S BEEN SORT OF WAYS AT LEAST ON THE FOOD BANK SIDE AND SO WHEN THE THOSE THOSE LEAKS FIRST HAPPENED. AND THEN WHEN THE RULES PUBLISHED YOU KNOW WHEN THAT SORT OF MEDIA ATTENTION HAPPENS I THINK WE'RE SEEING IT MORE ON OUR SIDE BUT AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE. TO KEEP THE SPACE SAFE AND SO IT'S IT'S MORE ANECDOTAL IN FOR CENTER SIDE BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT. ANONYMITY PRIVACY SHIRT RIGHT OKAY. AND I'M TO SAY IN A RACE THE US IN TERMS OF SPANISH LANGUAGE I MEAN DO ABOUT EIGHTY AYE LANGUAGES. THE TREND ISN'T QUITE AS CLEAR WITH AND WE ARE WATCHING THAT AS WELL WE WE CAN'T COMMUNICATE WE CAN'T CONCLUDE ANYTHING FROM THAT YEAH -- BUT THAT'S A TOUGHIE ON A RADAR AS WELL OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. ALRIGHT SO NEXT -- POLLS OF INVESTMENT IS SIMPLIFYING SENIOR ACCESS CAL FRESH AND WE HAVE SEIZE SPEAKING AT THAT SAID TRACY PATTERSON FOR THE PART DIRECTOR OF ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY AT CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES AND I THINK WARY HEARD A OR P.

ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME SENIORS INTO ACCOUNT FRESH ARE ONLY 20% OF CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME SENIORS GET CAL FRESH THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE SSI CASELOAD THAT IS THE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE -- WE ARE CASELOADS HAVE BEEN GROWING I WANT TO YOU KNOW COMMEND THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE -- I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT IT THOUGH IF WE CONTINUE AT THIS PACE WILL REACH THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN ABOUT TWENTY YEARS -- AND SO I THINK IF WE WANT CALIFORNIA TO LEAD WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS WHOLE PROCESS BOTH WITH US ASIDE EXPANSION AND FOR THE ENTIRE LOW INCOME SENIOR POPULATION BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT. YOU KNOW EXACTLY THE SAME GROUP -- AND SO CDSS HAS PARTICIPATED IN SOMETHING CALLED THE ELDERLY SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION PROJECT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT INCLUDES POLICY TO STREAMLINE THE ENROLLMENT RECERTIFICATION PROCESS IT HOUSE IMMEDIATELY HELP THE SENIORS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT -- THAT IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR SENIORS WHO HAVE NO ADDITIONAL INCOME SO THERE ARE MANY LOW INCOME SENIORS WHO DO HAVE PART TIME OR SEASONAL WORK TO GET BY -- AND SO WHAT WE ARE REQUESTING IS A ONE TIME INVESTMENT TO IMPLEMENT A USER CENTERED APPROACH TO A SIMPLIFIED IMPLICATE APPLICATION PROCESS WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT TO LOOK AT THE FULL APPLICATION. OF SERVE ECOSYSTEM ON BOTH THE EAST UP SPECIFIC HOUSEHOLDS AND HOW TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE WE WANT TO CAPTURE AS MANY SENIORS AS POSSIBLE. AND WE HAVE TO GET BE AT BETTER THAN THE LAST IN THE NATION -- AND WE ALL WANT TO BE ALL HANDS ON DECK TO DO THAT AND SO WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THE APPLICATION ITSELF IS NOT A PANACEA. ON THIS NEEDS TO BE PART OF A REIMAGINING OF THE POLICY AND PROCESS SEES THAT WORK TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE ENROLLMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO REALLY NEED IT AND DESERVE TO LIVE IN A AGE WITH DIGNITY FREE FROM HUNGER. THANK YOU ANY COMES FROM CITY TO CITY. NO USER CENTERED DESIGN IS A BIG BIG PRIORITIES OF OURS AS WELL AND I THINK WE HAVE -- I WILL SAY THE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS THE LAST THREE YEARS FROM THE FEDERAL PILOT TO THE EXPANSION OF SSI TO A NEW OUT REACH CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING THROUGH A LOCAL AREA AGENCIES ON AGING SO WE ARE.

FREQUENCY OF DISASTERS IN OUR STATE -- THAT LABOR INTENSIVE MANUAL PROCESS -- IS COSTLY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT DELAYS THE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY BENEFITS TO PEOPLE WHO LITERALLY OFTEN ARE SURVIVING AT LEAST FOR A PERIOD OF TIME ONLY ON THOSE DISASTER BENEFITS THAT WE CAN GET TO THEM. WHAT'S MORE WHEN PEOPLE AFFECTED BY DISASTERS MOVE BECAUSE THEY'VE LOST THEIR PLACE TO ANOTHER COUNTY. THAT COUNTY THAT RECEIVES THEM DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO SORT OF AUTOMATED INFORMATION MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF DISASTER VICTIMS ARE ASK IS.

THANK YOU THANK YOU TO PAN. OUT YES OVER THE LAST YEAR SO WE'VE BEEN REFOCUSING OUR EFFORTS ON CAL WORKS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS WE HAVE HAD INCREASES TO THE COW WORKS THAT BENEFIT LEVELS AND GRANT INCREASES AS WELL AS SERVICES -- A NEW DIAPER BENEFIT HAS BEEN ADDED FOR SOME OF THE YOUNG PARENTS WITHIN THE PROGRAM WE HAD EXPANSION TO A HOUSING ASSISTANCE EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY FOR HOMELESS ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES. AND EVEN ADD THE ADDITION OF A ONE TIME EDUCATIONAL INCENTIVE INCLUDED -- WE ALSO HAVE OBVIOUSLY REPEAL THE REQUIREMENT FOR FINGERPRINTING -- AND MADE SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THE BUDGETING METHODOLOGY WITHIN THE COW WORK SINGLE ALLOCATION ON THE ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE YOU'LL HEAR AN UPDATE IN JUST A MOMENT ON THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES SIDE -- WE'VE ALSO LAUNCHED OUR TO GENERATION APPROACH TO HOW WE'RE SERVICING HOLISTICALLY CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITHIN THE PROGRAM LAUNCHING OUR CAL WORKS HOME VISITING INITIATIVE WHICH WILL ALSO SPEAK TO IN JUST A MOMENT -- AND ARE SET TO LAUNCH OUR CAO WORKS OUT COMES ACCOUNTABILITY AND REVIEW COMING UP HERE IN JULY SO -- QUITE A BIT OF CHANGE IN AND POLICY AND NEW RESOURCES TO FAMILIES THAT IN MOVING FORWARD.

AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO -- INCLUDES FULL YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR HOME VISITING INITIATIVE ALSO MAKING IT A PERMANENT COMPONENT WITHIN OUR CAL WORKS PROGRAM. WE ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL EXPANSION TO ASK HOW WORKS HOUSING SUPPORT SO THOSE ARE ALL PROPOSALS AT CURRENTLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WE'LL GO INTO THE DETAIL OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CHAIR AT YOUR PLEASURE. HE COMES FROM LA -- I FINANCE. OKAY AND IN TERMS OF SO HE SHOULD. HAVE A SEPARATE SECTION. SO I GUESS AT THE OUT ONE WE YES I WANT TO GO ON WITH THE OTHER QUESTIONS HERE. SO. THANK YOU CHAIR -- WITH REGARDS TO THE CASE LOW DECLINES IT WOULD NOTE THAT THE TENANT CASELOADS ARE DECLINING NATIONWIDE AND IN FACT CALIFORNIA IS ON A MUCH SLOWER DOWNWARD TREND IN OTHER STATES. THE CALIFORNIA TEN OF POVERTY RATE IS THE HIGHEST RATIO NATIONWIDE BUT MORE THAN A 10% MARGIN. MEANING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE STRONGEST DEMONSTRATION OF ANY PROGRAM IN THE NATION OF ENGAGEMENT IN SERVING FAMILIES IN POVERTY. NEARING FURTHER INTO THE CASE THAT I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE DO A GOOD JOB OF TOUCHING OF THE MORE THAN 80% OF CHILDREN'S AND POP. EXCUSE ME CHILDREN IMPOVERISHED -- BUT STILL WE WE ALWAYS THINK WE CAN DO BETTER. SINCE THE PEAK OF THE COWARDS CASELOAD AT ALMOST SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN JUST AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION THE TOTAL CASE THAT HAS BEEN DECLINING ALONG WITH CALIFORNIA'S IMPROVING ECONOMY. THE GRANT INCREASES IN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN DID SLOW THE NATURAL CASELOAD DECLINE IN A LOT FAMILIES WHO EARN MORE INCOME TO STAY IN THE PROGRAM FOR LONGER. FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CSS PROJECTS THE BASE CASE LOAD FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WILL DECREASE BY ABOUT 8% [inaudible] AND THAT. THE CASE LOAD FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY WILL DECREASE BY ABOUT SIX POINT 9% FROM THAT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ESTIMATES. AS WITH REGARDS THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES SPECIFIC CASELOAD -- THAT'S COMPRISED OF ALL THE ADULTS THAT ARE A CHOIR TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OFFER TO WORK ACTIVITIES. AS WELL AS THOSE WITH WELFARE TO WORK EXEMPTIONS WERE VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE PROJECT -- THE BASE CASE LOAD WILL DECREASE BY EIGHT EIGHT POINT 9% FROM THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR AND THAT THE KIDS LOOK FOR NINETEEN TWENTY WILL DECREASE BY SIX POINT 2% FROM THAT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ASKED HIM IN. WITH REGARDS TO STAGE ONE CHILD CARE CASELOAD -- WHICH IS COMPRISED OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHO ARE WORKING OR PARTICIPATING OFFERED WORK ACTIVITIES THIS CASELOAD -- INCLUDES CHILDREN OF CURRENT CAL RECIPIENTS AS WELL AS THE FORMER RECIPIENTS AGAIN FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CSS PROJECTS THE BASE CASELOAD -- WILL DECREASE BY TEN POINT 8% FROM THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR AND THAT. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY OF SIX POINT ESTIMATES SO WE SEE ALL ALL CASELOADS TRENDING DOWN. AND JUST I MEAN -- AND DISTRICT WEEKLY IS. IN TERMS OF A POTENTIAL RECESSION THIS IS BE OF THE LONG EXPANSION. WHILE I WAS A IN HISTORY BUT BEEN THE STORY ALONG THIS IS WHAT'S THE HOUSEHOLD ROBUST AS THIS IN THE FACE OF A POTENTIAL RECESSION. THE CASELOAD DECREASE. ELIO YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THAT. SO AT THIS POINT I THINK OUR OFFICE AND TO MYUNDERSTANDING THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL BELIEVES THAT THE ECONOMY WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND BUT CERTAINLY ECONOMIST AND OTHERS HAVE RAISES CONCERN ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE THE EXPANSION OUR MODELS AND I BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S AS WELL. ANTICIPATE THE CONTINUED EXPANSION SO THESE DECLINES IN THE CASE OF A REFLECTIVE OF THAT BUT ANY CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A SORT OF REVERSING THAT TREND IN THE IN THE TOWERS CASE SO AS WE SAW ON DURING THE LAST RECESSION. ALL RIGHT WELL I I GUESS IN TERMS OF PARTICULARLY IN YOU KNOW WE'LL TALK ABOUT SINGLE APPLICATION FORM SUPPORT THIS -- I GUESS TO A LITTLE BIT OF A THINKING ABOUT ARE THE OTHERS LEVEL RESILIENCE WERE BUILDING AND RIGHT IN TERMS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE -- IT BECAUSE AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT THURSDAY -- WE CAN MODEL IT AND WILL IT'S LIKE PREDICTING THE WEATHER AND WE GET BETTER AND BETTER AT IT BUT STILL THINGS HAPPEN AND SO I JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESILIENCE JUST. KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU KNOW I SEE THESE CONTINUE DECREASES AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT HAPPENS -- BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T PEOPLE ARE NOW LEAVING POVERTY AND NOT NEEDING THAT TENNIS THAT THE SUPPORT BUT AND AT THE MADAME GET ALONG ANXIOUS ABOUT WHETHER YOU KNOW IF IT DOESN'T FALL. AT OUR PREPAREDNESS FOR THAT NOW SO. IF IF I MAY ADD A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS ONE WITHIN THE NEW REVISION SOURCING ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY ON ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATION WE DID. BUILD IN THE CONCEPT OF HAVE KIND OF THAT CASE LOAD AT BANDS THAT -- IF THE CASE LOAD SHOULD DROP AS SIGNIFICANT OR INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY OTHERS ONLY ONE INCREMENTS THAT CAN BE PASSED THROUGH WITHIN A GIVEN YEARS AS PROVIDING SOME STABILITY FOR COUNTY STAFF ACT THAT COULDN'T RAMP UP IF IN IT IN THE CASE OF A SIGNIFICANT RECESSION WITH THE HIGHER CASELOAD IN. THE SAME ISSUE WITH CONTINUE DECLINED SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHEN IT JUST MEANT WE MADE THAT WOULD KIND OF BILLS AND I THINK THAT SAFETY NET WHICH YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT JUST A MINUTE IS ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THAT TO TRY. TO BE PREPARED IN THE CASE OF A FEATURE RECESSION. ALL RIGHT SO WHAT WELL CENTURY TOUCHING ON SINGLE APPLICATION WHAT'S THE STATUS AT WHERE ARE WE GREAT YEAH THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES SINGLE OCCASION FUNDING METHODOLOGY REVIEW AND AND MODIFICATION IS UNDER WAY THIS PROCESS LIKE THE PROCESS TAKEN ON LAST YEAR FOR ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATION WILL OCCUR IN STAGES FIRST FOCUSING. ON THE CASE MANAGEMENT ASPECTS AND THEN LATER ON THE SERVICES SIDE SO THE STATE IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH C. B. AND OTHE STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVISE THAT METHODOLOGY -- AND WE WANT ONE THAT BETTER REFLECTS AND THE DEMANDS THE COUNTIES REALLY FACED WITH REGARDS TO PROVIDING MEANINGFUL CASE MANAGEMENT AND SERVICE REYES TO A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CASE TYPES. OF THE UPDATED METHODOLOGY WILL REFLECT WHAT IS NEEDED TO SERVE THAT FULL SPECTRUM OF CASE TIMES WITH APPROPRIATE FUNDING. HOUSE OF FOLLOWING CASE MANAGEMENT THE DEPARTMENT IN STAKEHOLDERS WILL REVIEW THE SERVICES PERSONAL METHODOLOGY TO DESERVE WHAT ADDITIONAL EXCUSE ME TO DETERMINE WHAT ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS MIGHT BE NEEDED. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WE'RE HOPING TO COME TO AGREEMENT ON FINAL AGREEMENT ON THE METHODOLOGY SOON. THERE WILL BE SOMETHING IN THE MAYOR VISION OKAY WE'RE HAVING ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS IN CONTINUING. TO WORK TOWARDS THAT OKAY I LIKE THAT IDEA. OKAY AND IS IT IN THIS THAT THAT SORT OF BECAUSE WE KNOW WE TOOK A ONE PIECE EARLIER SO THAT. THAT KIND OF ADDRESS THE ZERO I THINK THAT THAT SINGLE ALLOCATION ARE ARE. THE CHARGE WAS TO START WITH L. G. BUT THAT'S KIND OF HOW WE FACE DEBATE ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATION WE'RE NOW AT EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND AS MR MAGNESS NIKOLAI POINTED OUT WE'RE TAKING THAT AND PHASES SO WE'RE RIGHT CAN'T CASE MANAGER IN THE WILL TURN TO SERVICES. I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE ARE MINDFUL OF IS THAT WE ARE ALSO MAKING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO WHAT WE KNOW YIELDS THE BEST SUCCESS FOR THE COW WORKS PARTICIPANTS WITH OUR CAL OR INITIATIVE WHICH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IN A MOMENT SO. AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT IS THAT CASE MANAGEMENT WHAT IS THAT SERVICE TO RAY OUT WILL NEED TO CONTINUE THINKING THROUGH HAT WHAT THE IMPACT OF ANY REVISION IN AT THE METHODOLOGY IS OVER TIME. AS WERE EVEN CHANGING AND EVOLVING IN THE PROGRAM OKAY BUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME. IN TERMS OF THE THAT METHODOLOGY WERE PRETTY CLOSE I MEAN IT OVER YOU CAN JOIN TO OF ALL BUT WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE TO SENSUALLY ADDRESSING AT LEAST THE FIRST ITERATION FROM WHAT WE PREVIOUSLY BEFORE SAID IT WAS A STRAIGHT LINEAR DIDN'T TAKE OUT FOR COSTS FIXED COSTS OR SOMETHING. OKAY. WE GIVE THE WELL FOR DIRECTORS LACKEY OKAY I LAKE AREA IT'S NOT FROWNING THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD NEWS OKAY. OKAY ALL RIGHT. WELL I I DO HAVE I DID I DO YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS -- MY AND I REMEMBER BEING HERE SAYING WE NEED TO GET THIS THING FIXED AND SO I APPRECIATE PEOPLE PUTTING OUT -- NOW PUTTING THE WORK AND EFFORT INTO INTO MAKING THIS HAPPEN -- AND SO THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- ALWAYS KEEP GOING E. ID INCREASE STORY. QUESTION. FOUR THANK YOU IS SIMPLE ANSWER HERE THE DEPARTMENT WOULD EXPECTED THIS PROPOSAL THAT ANY PROPOSAL TO IN TO INCREASE OR CHANGE THEIR YEAH I DO YOU WOULD ALSO. SUPPORT INCREASE FOR PARTICIPATION RATES. AND CALOR CONTRARIA CALOR SO CALOR IS A DISTINCT MOVE AWAY FROM THIS OLD WORK FIRST MENTALITY IN HISTORIC EMPHASIS ON THE W. P. R. WHICH IS THE SINGLE. FEDERAL MEASURE -- AND A POOR PROXY IT BEST IN A PERVERSE INCENTIVE AT WORST THAT PREVIOUSLY DROVE ALL THE DECISIONS MAKING REALLY FOR CARRIAGE PROGRAM DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION. ALSO CAL OR REPRESENTS A CRITICAL PATH FORWARD IN MY IN MY OPINION FROM IN THE STATE'S. FOR STANDING BY A MESSAGE OF ENGAGEMENT AND REALLY CLIENT CENTERED PROGRAM -- WHICH INTENTIONALLY SERVERS CLIENTS AND MEET SOMEWHERE THERE AT ALSO HUNDREDS OF STAKEHOLDERS REALLY. HAVE WORKED FOR OVER EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THREE MORE THAN FIFTY MEETINGS TO CRAFT A FRAMEWORK FOR THE CAL OR CULTURE SHIFT REPRESENTING A MOVE TOWARD CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND REAL MODEL FOR DATA DRIVEN PROGRAM MANAGEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. US THE STATE AND STAKEHOLDERS OF WORK VERY HARD TO DEFINE AND DEFIES THROUGH THE THREE COMPONENT PARTS. IN STATUTE FOR CAL OR AND I'M HAPPY TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THEIR NEARLY FINALIZED IN PREPARATION FOR THE JULY TWENTY NINETEEN LAUNCH. SO PART ONE IS A SET OF TWENTY SEVEN PROCESS SHORT TERM MEDIUM TERM. AND LONG TERM METRICS THAT REFLECT THE COW WORKS PROGRAM LOGIC MODEL. PART TWO OF THAT IS A COUNTY SELF ASSESSMENT WHICH IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COUNTIES TO REALLY DIG INTO THOSE METRICS AND REFLECT. A GATHERING LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS IN CONVERSATION AND INCORPORATING ADDITIONAL CLIENT FEEDBACK THROUGH A NEW CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY. THIS WILL ALLOW THE LOCAL NEW ONES PROGRAM DESIGN INNOVATIONS TO REALLY DRIVE THAT SPIRIT OF CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. ON UPDATED PROGRAM MANAGEMENT MODEL. THREES A SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT PLAN WHICH CAPTURES COUNTY GOALS FOR INNOVATIONS THOSE TWO WEEKS AND STRATEGIES THAT WILL HELP US TO BETTER SERVE THE COVERAGE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. COUNTIES WILL CONNECT WITH OTHER COUNTIES THROUGH THAT PROCESS IN PEER SUPPORT -- IN REVIEW OF THE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT PLANS IN THE STATE WILL PARTNER WITH COUNTY THROUGHOUT ALL THREE OF THESE PHASES. OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING COACHING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. HELLO OR SENT TO LAUNCH LIKE I NOTED ON JULY TWENTY NINETEEN WITH THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA DASHBOARD INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE DASHBOARD WILL BE UPDATED WITH NEW METRICS IN PHASES AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE IN OUR AUTOMATED. AND THEN ON A REGULAR RULING BASIS MONTHLY IN. WORKING WITH C. WTA AND THE CONSORTIA AS WELL AS OUTSIDE PARTNERS TO REALLY TACKLE THE LIMITATIONS AND GENERALLY CREATE A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM FOR DATA DRIVEN APPROACHES WEREN'T NONE HAS EXISTED. THE FIRST COUNTY CSA WILL BE DRAFTED THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THE FIRST STEPS WILL BE. DRAFTED TO IN THE WINTER TWENTY TWENTY TO SPRING [inaudible] TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUR APPLICATION HAVE LIPSKY BROWN TO THE QUESTION. SO -- IN TERMS OF THE APPLICATION HAVE THE AGAIN AT BOTH THE CAL WORKS IN CALPERS PROGRAMS -- WERE PART OF A PROCESS TO LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT HOW DO YOU IMPROVE. VERIFICATIONS FOR PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS FOR THE COUNTY STAFF WHO ARE WORKING THROUGH THIS VERIFICATION PROCESS SEES SO WE ENLISTED SOCIAL INTEREST SOLUTIONS AS THE VENDOR TO YOU AT PROVIDE A ROAD MAP I IN A PLAN AND THEY UNDERTOOK A NUMBER OF FOCUS GROUPS -- INTERVIEWS AND SITE VISITS ACROSS THE STATE HAD TO REALLY TRYTO IDENTIFY WHAT TYPES OF SOLUTIONS WOULD SUPPORT VERIFICATION THE APPLICATION HUB WAS ONE AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MANY RELATED TO POLICY ALIGNMENT -- WAYS TO REDUCE THAT PAPERWORK -- AND ADD A STREAMLINED. PROCESSES SUCH AS SCANNING INFORMATION AND COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES LOBBIES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO -- WE ARE JUST AT THE POINT WHERE WE ARE IDENTIFYING OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE BROUGHT FORTH IN THAT REPORT INCLUDING THE HAVE HOW WE WILL. MOVE FORWARD TO PURSUE THOSE AND AS WE ARE IDENTIFYING THOSE WILL AGAIN ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP US ALONG THE WAY. AND THEN -- THAT CHANGES THE CITY A RESERVE. THAT FINANCE SURE SO I CAN KIND OF EXPLAIN THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING ON THIS PROPOSAL ON THAT WAS GENERALLY THAT. WE CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WANTED TO APPROACH A RESERVE MORE NIMBLY AND CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT I WE DESCRIBED A METHODOLOGY AROUND PUTTING FUNDING. INTO THE RESERVE AND PULLING FINDING OUT DURING A RECESSION. IT MIGHT OVERLOOK HOW UNIQUE SUMMER SESSIONS ARE COMPARED TO OTHERS. AND WHAT THE MEDI CAL AND CAL WORKS PROGRAM LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF SERVICE TYPES AT THAT POINT IN TIME. A CASELOAD LEVELS AND DEMOGRAPHICS OF THIS CASE LOADS. SO WE THOUGHT THAT BY REMOVING THAT METHODOLOGY THAT WOULD FREE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. TO HAVE A MORE FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING. WHAT FUNDING NEEDS TO GO INTO THE PROGRAM WHEN IT DOWNTURN OCCURS? AND THE FULL INTENT IS TO STILL KEEP THAT FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THE COWARDS AND MEDICAL PROGRAMS [inaudible] OKAY. OKAY -- SO ANY COMMENTS FROM LA ABOUT ANY OF THESE OTHER -- ALL THE ITEMS THAT. SURE I'LL SPEAK -- SPECIFICALLY TO THE THE RESERVE A CENTRAL CHANGES THAT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED. AS PART OF UP AS PART OF THIS BUDGET ON THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS JUST THE SORT OF STEP BACK ONE STEP IS THAT. THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACTS -- AND RELATED LEGISLATION. INCLUDED SUB ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE SAFETY NET RESERVE ONE EACH FOR CAL WORKSAND MEDI CAL AND SO. THERE WAS SORT OF FOR A FIRE WALL. STATUTORY. BUT NONETHELESS A FIREWALL BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMMERS ARE ACCOUNTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE THAT AND TREAT THEM AS SORT OF IN A SINGLE BUCKET TOGETHER -- WE THINK THAT THAT MIGHT. ALLOW THE LEGISLATION ADMINISTRATION SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUTURE -- BUT IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THE EXISTING STATUTORY. SUB ACCOUNTS STRUCTURE. SORT OF ELIMINATED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SHIFT FUNDS BACK AND FORTH. DEPENDING ON ITS NEEDS BECAUSE IT COULD CHANGE LAW UPPER STATUTE. AND THEN SECONDLY. THE FORMULA DRIVEN APPROACH THAT WAS -- SWIFT. RECOMMENDED OR OR THAT WAS -- INCLUDED IN THAT THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT RELATED LEGISLATION -- DEPARTING FROM THAT MY ALSO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SORT OF AS THE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED -- SPECIFIC DETERMINATIONS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THAT THE BUSINESS CYCLE OR OR THE COW WORKS CASELOAD THAT MIND ALLOW -- SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY SO WE CAN MAKE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON EITHER OF THOSE TWO PROPOSALS. REGARDING THE FORMULA DIFFERENT APPROACH WE WE DID POINT OUT THAT ONE ALTERNATIVE MIGHT BE SORT OF A COMPROMISE -- TO INCLUDE AS PART OF THE THE BUDGET CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE EACH YEAR. AN INDICATION OF WHAT THE CASE LOAD SAVINGS ARE IN A IN DOLLAR TERMS IN THE COW WORKS PROGRAM FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT AS THE CASE LOADS DECLINING AS IT IS NOW. AND SORT OF HIGHLIGHTING ARE ELEVATING THAT NUMBER AS PART OF THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS ALLOWING THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. TO SEE THAT NUMBER NEGOTIATE SAID A PORTION OF IT BE DEPOSITED IN THE RESERVE AND DIFFERENT PORTION BE USE FOR FOR OTHER PROGRAM PRIORITIES -- WITHOUT THIS IS SORT OF A WAY TO KEEP THAT FRONT AND CENTER IN THE CONVERSATION. SO WHAT I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE SAFETY NET RESERVE -- AGAIN NICE THAT THOUGH I WOULD THE ULTIMATELY THE FOR TO OUR BUDGETARY WHO CONCEIVED OF THE RESERVE BUT I WOULD -- SAY AT LEAST IN MY MIND -- AND NOW WE TALK ABOUT THE LANGUAGE SO FORTH SO. RIGHT. IT'S SO IT'S A CERTAIN EXTENT OF FLEXIBILITY IS GOOD I MEAN AFTER ALL -- NOW WE MAKE DECISIONS AND HAVING MORE FLEXIBILITY -- AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WE DON'T HAVE FLEXIBILITY BUT I. SO WOULD BE SURE WE PROTECT THE INTENT OF THE SIX THAT RESERVE AT LEAST IN MY MIND THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS FIRST OF ALL. THAT WERE. AND THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE RESERVE IS IS THAT DURING ESPECIALLY DURING A DOWNTURN THAT WE MAINTAIN AT LEAST UNTIL THE RESERVE IS EXHAUSTD THE THE THE SAME LEVEL OF BENEFITS AND THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR BENEFICIARIES RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE RECEIVING THAT THEY SHOULD. THAT EXISTS BECAUSE THEY TEND TO COUNTER CYCLICAL. YOU'RE LIKELY GET CUTS RIGHTS -- BECAUSE OF THAT THAT WE SHOULD DO THAT THAT'S PART THE PURPOSE RESERVE THE EVEN THAT OUT. I WOULD ALSO PRICE SAY THAT -- IN ALSO TO VOICE A PLANTATON TO SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT I MEAN I COULD SEE EVEN GOOD TIMES ON SAYING -- YOU KNOW LOOK WE ARE MEETING -- TO TAKE OUT THE RESERVE AND WE CAN. MOVE MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE SO THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THE THE THE THE RESERVE AS WELL IS TO BASICALLY. ALLOW IT'S NOW I REALIZE THAT ANY FUTURE LEGISLATURE OR GOVERNOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE CONSTITUTION CAN EVENTUALLY DO I REALLY WANT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AT ALL CHANGES BUT BUT I I THINK THAT AT LEAST IN MY MIND CONCEPTUALLY -- DOWN THAT THE TOURNEY LOOK AT EXACTLY LANGUAGE I THINK THAT'S PLACE TO ME THAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE IS THAT. YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT PRIOR YEAR AND YOU SAY WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT MAKING -- AND THAT EVEN IF WE PUT THE SAME LEVEL RESOURCE FOR SUSTAINING WERE NOT SO SO WE'RE NOT SUPPLANTING IN OUR PREVIOUS YEARS EFFORT. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STILL MAKE CUTS TO BENEFITS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WE GO THAT'S WHEN WE START DRYING DOWN FROM THAT NOT BEFORE AND BUT THAT'S A PURPOSE AND ONLY FOR THAT PURPOSE SO AND CERTAINLY HAS MANY OTHER WORTHY ITEMS AND BUDGETS BUT IS. I MEAN THAT'S HOW I SEE IT. ANY THOUGHTS FROM FINANCE. SURE AND AND I THINK THAT THAT THE A LOT OF THE ORIGINAL INTENT YOU SPOKE OF HIS STILL. PRESERVED IN THAT LANGUAGE THAT THE FINDINGS DEDICATED FOR THOSE PURPOSES FOR THOSE PROGRAMS -- HI BUT NOT NOTED ON HOW THE COUNTER CYCLICAL -- NATURE OF RECESSIONS NEEDS TO BE FACTORED IN TO HOW WE APPROACH USING THOSE RESERVE FUNDS. AND I I THINK OUR PROPOSAL ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT THAT AT THAT POINT IN TIME AND MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS ALONG WITH THE LEGISLATURE SO I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN ANY WHATEVER LANGUAGE WE PUT IN RECOGNIZING BE CHANGED BY ANY FUTURE LET'S SURGERY GOVERNOR IS TO CLEAR TO CLEARLY. STATE WHAT OUR DESIRE -- YOU KNOW I THINK IT NEEDS A DIFFERENT KIND OF CONVERSATION WHEN ONE HAS TO CHANGE THAT LANGUAGE. IF YOU PUT IN THAT LANGUAGE THAT AND TO AND SIMPLY SAY WELL SOME LEGISLATURE SOME THAT AND THEN WE JUST GOT LEFT A BLANK THERE SO I'M HOPING THAT IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WE WILL HAVE SOME LANGUAGE TO VERY CLEARLY DESCRIBE WHAT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. NOW FOR THIS RESERVE SO THAT -- THE RESERVES USED IMPROPERLY AND CERTAINLY AGAIN ANY FUTURE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR CAN. MAKE OTHER DECISIONS AND OKAY. ALL RIGHT OKAY SO WITH THAT -- I KNOW WE HAVE SOME PARENTS WHO WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT STAGE ONE AND THEY NEED TO GO SHORTLY SO I THINK WHAT WILL TAKE -- IT'S ONLY TAKE PUBLIC COME BEFORE WE ACTUALLY PRESENT THAT I'D. SENT YOU CAN GET GUYS SO YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DO THAT NOW WILL HERE -- ITEMS -- ISSUE NUMBER TWO SO THANK YOU WELCOME. I MEAN THIS MONEY. ON THE INVOICES ARE TO GO CHAPTER OF THE THANK YOU -- FOR SENATOR OF HIM FOR DOING THAT -- RIGHT NOW I WANT TO ASK A MIGHT ASK IS THAT I WANT TWELVE MONTHS ELIGIBILITY FOR STAGE ONE CHILD CARE -- I THINK BASICALLY WHAT WE HAVE STAGE ONE FROM DAY ONE PARENTS SLICE ARE DIFFERENT.

CURRENT CHILDCARE SUBSIDY CASE WORKER AND ALSO -- PARENT VOICES ORGANIZER FOR SOLANO COUNTY -- I'M HERE TO SUPPORT ALL OF THE CAL WORKS BUDGET PROPOSALS BUT I ALSO HAVE A LETTER FROM. A PARENT WHO COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE SHE'S BUSY -- WITH HER MID TERMS -- AND I PROMISE TO MAKE IT QUICK. MY NAME IS KATHLEEN READ I LIVE IN SOLANO COUNTY I AM A PARENT LEADER WITH PARENT VOICES ORGANIZATION AND I AM FIGHTING TO MAKE QUALITY CHILDCARE. ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE O ALL FAMILIES. I'M TAKING THE TIME TO WRITE THIS LETTER TO INFORM YOU OF THE CHALLENGES I FACE AS A SINGLE PARENT. TRANSITIONING INTO SOMETHING NEW. WHILE PROVIDING FOR MY CHILDREN AND MAINTAINING MY GOALS I HAVE LITTLE TO NO SECURITY THAT MY CHILDREN. WILL RECEIVE CONSISTENT QUALITY CHILDCARE I'VE HAD TO REQUEST ELEVEN CHILD CARE APPROVALS IN THE LAST SIXTEEN MONTHS TO ENSURE. MY CURRENT PROVIDER WOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN CARE IN ADDITION MANY FACILITIES AND PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN LESS LIKELY.

I AM A FULL TIME STUDENT I WORK PART TIME AND I AM WITH MY MAIN PROVIDER I'M THE MAN PROVIDER -- TO MY TO TALK TO OTHER CHILDREN.

AS OPPOSED TO WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER MY CHILDREN WILL BE CARED FOR TOMORROW NEXT WEEK OR NEXT MONTH. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY IT WAS -- THE JOINT TALK OF REVIEW -- OKAY -- ALL RIGHT AND WE'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE ALSO OF BEFORE IT THE PROPOSALS WERE INVESTMENTS THAT GO ON YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT THE OVERVIEW -- AND REALLY -- FLEET TIED TOGETHER -- WHAT YOU HEARD AROUND THE DISCUSSION AROUND CAL OR AND AND THE SINGLE ALLOCATION BECAUSE WE SEE THEM AS? TWO PIECES OF THE SAME MOMENT IN THE SAME DIRECTION THAT THE STATE IS HEADED -- AND WE CAN COVER WITH THE STATE AND WE ARE WELL I ACTUALLY CHAIRED ONE OF THE THE CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT COMMITTEE WE DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING ON THIS WE ARE VERY -- ENCOURAGED BY THE PATH THAT WE'RE GOING DOWN AND WE THINK THAT WILL MAKE A REALLY SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE WE THINK. ARMED AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER -- I WOULD REALLY URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT A VERY SHARP BY GOING FOR IT MAY REVISE AND BEYOND. ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SINGLE ALLOCATION FORMULA. BECAUSE TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE HOPE TO AND CAL WAR WE NEED TO BE GIVING COUNTIES THE APPROPRIATE FISCAL INCENTIVES. TO PUSH THEM IN THE DIRECTION OF DOING THE THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR FAMILIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL -- AND SO IN PARTICULAR I THINK YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE MORE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ENCOURAGEMENT FOR FAMILY SO SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO WORK WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE INCENTIVES. TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET EDUCATION HALF THE RECIPIENTS OF THE PROGRAM COME INTO IT WOULD OUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA SO THESE ARE REALLY CRITICAL DEVELOPMENTS I THINK IS. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THAT AND TYING BACK INTO WHAT YOU JUST HEARD ON THE TWELVE MONTH AUTHORIZATION FOR CHILD CARE. IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING APPROPRIATE FISCAL INCENTIVES WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT SERVICES ARE ACTUALLY BEING PROVIDED THAT PEOPLE NEED AT THE TIME THAT THEY NEED THEM. SO THAT ONCE WE TELL FAMILY THEY'RE GOING TO IT THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOING TO EDUCATION THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO REPEATEDLY GO BACK AND PURSUE AND TRY TO GET APPROVAL FOR CHILDCARE. FOR TRANSPORTATION COSTS OR FOR SCHOOL BOOKS WHICH WE FREQUENTLY HERE ARE PROVIDED TO STUDENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF SEMESTERS SO IT'S MORE THAN JUST. FIXING THE SINGLE ALLOCATION IT'S ALSO MAKING SURE THAT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED NGUYEN FAMILIES NEED THEM AND REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF BACK AND FORTH IT'S GOOD CURRENTLY OCCURRING IN THE PROGRAM. SO WE JUST WANTED TO KIND OF BOLD TIE THOSE TWO ISSUES TOGETHER AND THEN LASTLY ON THE SAFETY NET RESERVE -- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE RESERVES ABSOLUTE A GREAT THING TO DO AND HAS SUFFERED I KNOW YOU WERE HERE WHEN WE HAD TO MAKE A LOT OF REALLY DIFFICULT CUTS -- BEFORE AND THAT WOULD HAVE MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IF WE HAD THAT RESERVE AT THAT TIME WE DO HOWEVER. TO CONCUR WITH YOU THAT WE PREFERRED THE STRUCTURE OF THE RESERVES IT CURRENTLY IS. WE AND WE DO THINK IT WILL DO A BETTER JOB OF INSULATING CALLERS FAMILIES FROM SHARP DROPS AND BENEFITS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I REALIZE THAT IN A BRIEF EVEN THOUGH I GIVE YOU MORE TIME -- PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING AND PERHAPS A MORE DETAILED LETTER AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE THAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IN THE CAL OR PROCESS. OUR OUR SOME COMMUNICATION OF SOME SORT. THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I HAVE AN ITEM COMING UP. OKAY EXCELLENT ALLRIGHT WONDERFUL. OKAY -- SO WITH THAT THAT'S MOVE ON A KNOW THAT -- WE'VE JUST HEARD FROM FUND FAMILIES ABOUT CAO WORK STAGE ONE BUT I THE SINCE THEY HAD TO LEAVE FIVE ONE TO GIVE A CHANCE TO SAVE -- SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO OUR STATE WANT DISSIPATION. SURE SO FOR THE PURPOSE PERSPECTIVE CAN GAIN CAM JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AT YOUR QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA ASK ABOUT THE CASE LOAD CHANGES IN STAGE ONE RELATIVE TO THE OTHER AT PORTIONS OF THE CASELOAD WITHIN CAL WORKS AND IN FACT YOU DO SEE A CORRELATION AS WE MIGHT. EXPECT BETWEEN THE DECLINE IN THE PLACEMENT SERVICES CASELOAD IN THE STAGE ONE CHILD CARE CASELOAD THEY ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL AS PROPOSE GOING INTO THE NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR -- IN TERMS OF THE CHALLENGES THAT FAMILIES FACE WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER TO TAKE UP STAGE ONE I THINK THAT -- AGAIN YOU JUST HEARD SOME SOME CHALLENGES THAT FAMILIES HAVE FACE TO AN EXPERIENCED -- THE AB PIECE THAT WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT VERY CLOSELY ARE THE POINTS IN TIME IN WHICH A CHILD CARE IS OFFERED THE LANGUAGE THAT'S USED TO MAKE THAT OFFER. AND INSURING THAT IT'S HAPPENING IN MULTIPLE TIMES ACROSS THAT THAT PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCE AND CAL WORKS SO -- THAT IS THAT IS ONE PIECE -- IT IS A PERSONAL CHOICE SYSTEM AND SO -- IN TERMS IN YOUR AGENDA POINTS OUT KIND OF ADD THE ADDITION AND ADDS CAL WHICH PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN OTHER TRUCKERS SUBSIDY PROGRAMS ABOUT TO BE ON STAGE ONE AND SO WE DO HAVE THAT. AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES BUT REALLY ENSURING THAT FAMILIES UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM THAT IT THAT NO OR LIMITED COST -- AND REMINDING THEM THAT THAT AS THEY PARTICIPATE ENGAGE IN A MULTITUDE OF ACTIVITIES ALONG THE WAY IS REALLY CRITICAL AND WE DO HAVE. I CERTAINLY REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE THAT WE'VE BEEN AT FOCUSED ON THAT AND HAVE SEEN COUNTIES -- MAKING THOSE OFFERS -- SO IN IN TERMS OF WHAT WE JUST HEARD AND AND AND KIND OF THE EVOLUTION THEY HAVE AT CHILD CARE IN THE TENNIS PROGRAM PARTICULARLY FIRST HERE ASSN HEARING CALIFORNIAN CAL WORKS -- WE REALLY DID TO ADD DEVELOP KIND OF OUR POLICIES RELATED TO SUPPORTING THE CHILD CARE USE AS A PARTICIPANT IN AN ACTIVITY ENGAGE SO THE AUTHORIZATION THAT OCCURS TODAY -- IS PRETTY SPECIFIC TO THE ACTIVITIES THAT THE FAMILIES ARE ENGAGING AYE AND THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THAT BUT OF COURSE AT AS WE ADD DEVELOP THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO AND WE'RE THINKING THROUGH REALLY THE ULTIMATE BENEFIT OF QUALITY EARLY LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR CHILDREN -- WE DO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT WE NEED ACROSS ALL CHILD CARE PROGRAMS THAT SOMETHING YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL TO REALLY ENSURE THIS IS THAT A HIGH QUALITY CONSUMER EDUCATION EXPERIENCE THAT THE FAMILIES RECEIVING. TO THEN MAKE THAT -- BEST CHOICE FOR THEIR CHILD -- AND REALLY ENSURE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THIS QUALITY SETTING SO. THAT'S HOW WE GET THERE OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM LA -- FINANCE. OKAY NOW WE HAVE OUR PANEL HERE AND ZERO ONE WELCOME. THE PRINTER THAT THE ISSUE. IF WE START PRUNING COOPER SENIOR POLICY AT CHECKOUT TUCKER LAWCENTER AND THE ACTUALLY OF FROM. VOICES SORRY I INTRODUCE YOURSELF. REAVIS BY PARENT VOICES FRESNO OKAY EXCELLENT SO -- WELCOME AND BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU THREE MINUTES FREE SHADED DEATH SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN PAN. THIS BUDGET REQUEST WILL STREAMLINE STAGE ONE CHILD CARE ELIGIBILITY RULES THAT ALL CAL WORKS FAMILIES ARE AFFORDED THE SAME BENEFITS OF STABLE RELIABLE AND CONSISTENT CHILD CARE. THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR FAMILIES PROSPECTS AND TO PROMOTE THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT AND WELL BEING. I THINK YOU'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT IN THE PUBLIC COMMENT IT'S KIND OF NICE TO HAVE THAT GO FIRST -- THE ABOUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT PARENTS EXPERIENCE AND THE BARRIERS THAT CAL WORKS FAMILIES FACE TRYING TO GET AND KEEP STAGE ONE CHILD CARE. OFTEN THEY ARE NOT AWARE THAT PAID CHILDCARE IS AVAILABLE IF THEY HAVE BEEN INFORMED THE PROCESSES BURDENSOME AND FULL OF A LOT OF RED TAPE AND OR MULTIPLE STEPS TO GET AN AUTHORIZATION. THEY ARE OFTEN SHORT TERM AND FREQUENTLY DISRUPTED ONE DAY THREE DAYS. AND FAMILIES WHO DO SUCCEED AND GETTING AND KEEPING STAGE ONE CAN EXPERIENCE A DISRUPTION AT THE TIME THAT THEY TRANSFERRED TO THE NEXT STAGE OF CHILD CARE STAGE. TO WE FIND THAT THERE ARE PARENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CAL WORKS CHILD CARE WHO ARE APPEARING ON COUNTY WAITING LISTS FOR CHILDCARE BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER BEEN PROPERLY CONNECTED TO THE RESOURCES THEY QUALIFY. FOR SO VERY SIMPLY THIS BUDGET. REQUEST WOULD ESTABLISH TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY IN STAGE ONE WHICH IS ALREADY PROVIDED IN EVERY CHILD CARE SUBSIDY PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA EXCEPT FOR STAGE. ONE AND I WON'T GO INTO THE BENEFITS OF THAT BUT I THINK WHAT. MS JOHNSON JUST DESCRIBED OF MAKING SURE THERE ARE GOOD CONSISTENT QUALITY CHILD CARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO PARENTS AND THE BENEFITS TO CHILDREN OF HAVING THAT DURING THIS TIME OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW PARENTS TO GET CHILD CARE TO PARTICIPATE IN NEEDED ACTIVITIES AND AGAIN -- MOVING SLIGHTLY FROM THE WELFARE TO WORK CONCEPT TO WHAT IS IT THAT A FAMILY NEEDS TO STABILIZE AND IMPROVE ITS PROSPECTS YOU HEARD ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO COULDN'T GO TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNSELLING OR TRAUMA COUNSELING. BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T BRING THEIR CHILD WITH THEM. AND GIVE THE PARENT THE OPTIONAL FULL TIME CARE SO THAT THEIR CHILDREN GET BETTER ACCESS TO THE RANGE OF LICENSED EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES. ENSURE SMOOTH TRANSFERS. I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SAN FRANCISCO PILOT BUT IT HAS HAD -- AND A VERY BIG EFFECT ON THE STAGE ONE FAMILIES THAT HAVE ENJOYED TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY AND IF YOU'D LIKE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I CAN PROVIDE IT TO THE COMMITTEE -- THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL ALSO ADOPTS THE TOP RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON -- COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CHAIRMAN PAN I BELIEVE YOU WERE HANDED THE PARENTS RECOMMENDATIONS -- CALLED WAITING TO BE SEEN DEMANDING TO BE HEARD YOU'VE GOT IT. ON PAGE NINE THIS RECOMMENDATION IS THE ONE FOR IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION. OF SOME OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ALSO LISTED IN THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION REPORT AND I CAN LET YOU KNOW THOSE DETAILS AS WELL -- I WANT TO TURN TO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE DEPARTMENT THEM -- THE MEASURE OF YOUR YOUTH OKAY THAT -- LET ME JUST SAY IN IN VERY QUICK CLOSING. WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY WELFARE TO WORK REQUIREMENTS I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT IT DOESN'T CHANGE COUNTY DISCRETION TO DEFINE STABILITY. IN DECIDING WHEN A FAMILY IS READY TO BE TRANSFERRED. AND IT DOESN'T EXPAND CURRENT LAW GOVERNING WHEN CHILD CARE IS AVAILABLETO EITHER VOLUNTEERS FOR SANCTIONED ADULTS. SO YOU'VE HEARD THAT ARE CAL WORKS PARENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO CREATE THE BEST LIFE POSSIBLE FOR THEIR CHILDREN BY PROVIDING THIS CONTINUOUS CHILD CARE. WHERE THEY CAN GROW AND LEARN THIS PROPOSAL WILL GIVE CHILDREN IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM THE STRONG START THAT WILL PREVENT THE PREPARE THEM FOR LIFELONG SUCCESS? INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. I REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE STAGE ONE IMPROVEMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU. AND OF THE FUTURE YOU TRAVELING HERE SHE TOOK UP ALL THE TIME. IF YOU COULD JUST -- SHARE YOUR STORY BRIEFLY I'D APPRECIATE WALL THE MAIN PART OF MY STORY THAT I WANT HER TO IS THE MARK WHERE. I WAS ON STAGE -- ONE THAT WAS GOING REALLY GREAT -- I GOT A JOB TO WHERE I WAS MAKING TOO MUCH TO STAY ON CASH. EIGHT SO THEY WERE TRANSFER ME TO STAGE. TWO BUT I GOT LOST IN. THE COMMUNICATION. A SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT. WE HAVE THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE AGENCIES THE L. AT THE DATA SCREEN SO THEY CAN SEE. THE INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT IT ON ME. TO LET THEM KNOW -- THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT THEY'RE LIKE NOBODY GOT IT BACK TO THEM BUT NO NO YOU GOT TO TALK TO THEM SO THEY KEPT SENDING ME BACK AND FORTH INSTEAD OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER. THE STRESS SO YEAH AND YEAH IT DID PUT A LOT OF STRESS ON ME -- I STARTED LOSING SLEEP -- TO WHERE I DIDN'T GET ENOUGH REST FOR WORK. TO WHERE I WAS KIND OF SLACKING IN MY JOB AND THEN ALSO TOWARD MY KIDS THEY WANTED MY ATTENTION AND BECAUSE I WAS REALLY STRESSED OUT I STARTED SNAPPING AT THEM FROM THE LITTLE REASONS OF LIKE. THANK WAY WAY BACK IN HIS THE WHOLE YEAH IT IS REALLY REALLY STRESSFUL TO GO THROUGH THAT. I THINK ANY OF US WHO HAVE CHILDREN AND REALIZE THAT EITHER WE HAVE TO GO PICK THEM UP FROM CHILD CARE WE DON'T HAVE CHILD CARE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING I'VE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION THE STRESS LEVEL GOES WAY WAY OF SELF. MYSELF WILL TELL YOU THAT. TO THE OTHER THING TOO IS THAT BECAUSE I LOST THE STATE CARE I LEFT MY DAUGHTER WITH MY FATHER WHO IS DISABLED. SO HE HAD OR SITTING IN FRONT OF THE TV MOST THE TIME AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE HER BEEN IN DAYCARE LIKE SHE WAS WHEN I WAS ON STAGE. ONE TO ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING SO SO ACTUALLY I GUESS THE QUESTION I POSE IS ASIDE FROM MONEY I MEAN THIS IS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IS THERE ANY PART. WITH THEIR ANY POLICY ISSUES WITH THIS -- CONCERNS -- SO I THINK WE DOUBLE ALSO AGREED THAT THE POLICY HAS MERIT -- AND THAT THAT THE COUNTRY'S CRITICAL WE DO AGAIN WHAT. THE AGAIN INTENT IN GOAL IS TO HAVE A CHILD CARE NOT BE A BARRIER TO THE ENGAGEMENT IN THE REST OF THE CALYX ARRAY SO. THAT WE WE BELIEVE THE PROPOSAL AS MAYOR. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM LA UP BECAUSE I'M ANY THINK THIS DESTRUCTION -- AND ALSO -- WELL FIRST OF ALL THE DESTRUCTION CERTAINLY IS IS IS A HUGE HUGE PROBLEM RIGHT I MEAN AS I AM A PHYSICIAN WE TALK ABOUT KIND WE CARE AND WHEN THE OF DESTRUCTION CARE AND HAND OFFS AND PEOPLE FALLING OFF SO -- AS A CERTAINLY I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG ISSUE AND THEN -- AND THEN OF COURSE -- NOT KNOWING YEAH I EIGHT EIGHT A AND A HEARING ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING THEY'RE KIND OF ON A STAGE WHEN THEY SERVE HAVE AND THEY DON'T KNOW HAVE SHORT PERIODS OF TIME BECAUSE ONLY CAN COVER CERTAIN THINGS. IS THERE AN ISSUE THERE IN TERMS OF BEING SURE PEOPLE ARE AT MORE RELIABLY KNOWS BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE TO DO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS RIGHT IF YOU'RE JUST SO. THERE IS THAT AT I HAVE FLEXIBILITY THAT'S BACK CURRENTLY ALLOWED IN TERMS OF THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT CHILD CARE IS ALLOW IS ALLOWABLE USES -- FOR THE AUTHORIZATIONS AGAIN THERE ARE SPECIFIC TO THE ENGAGE IN THOSE ACTIVITIES SO AS THOSE AND ACTIVITIES CHANGE OVER TIME WHICH IS HIGHLY LIKELY AS A AS A NEW PARTICIPANTS ENTERING THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM -- THAT AUTHORIZATION HAPPENS FREQUENTLY RIGHT SO THE AUTHORIZATION CHANGES TO THAT THE CHANGES IN THE WELFARE TO WORK PLAN IN THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING FORWARD SO. THAT CHILD CARE IS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED TO THE ACTIVITIES THAT DAY AT PARTICIPANTS ENGAGED IN. SO. WELL LET ME LET ME JUST THIRTY THINK THIS THROUGH WALKED US THROUGH SO. SOMEONE'S ON STAGE ONE RATE AND THEY MAY. THERE'S A LIST OF ACTIVITIES THAT DON'T PROVIDE CHILDCARE FOUR EIGHT AND IT'S AND THEN. INTO THE PROBLEM SO SO. I GUESS. WELL. DO YOU ACTUALLY FIND CHILDCARE PROVIDERS FOR LIKE FINE YOU KNOW FOR THESE FEW WEEKS I DO THIS AND THEN THOSE TWO WEEKS OF OURS THAT THOSE HOURS THE NUMBER OF HOURS SHIFTS BECAUSE THIS ONE HAS TRIED TO GET CHILD CARE USUALLY. YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO BE A BABYSITTER TO AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT OR TALKING A MORE CONSISTENCY RIGHT. THERE CAL LIKE OKAY YOUR CHILD'S GONNA BE I MEAN THEY UNDERSTAND OF THE CHILD SECOND THEY MAY BE OUT BUT IT'S CANTONS IT'S LOOK THE OTHER WAY RIGHT HELP YOUR CHILD GOING TO BE HERE FROM THE OUT THIS TIME TO THIS TIME EVERY DAY WITH MAYBE SOME EXCEPTIONS ON VACATION. OR SICK OR WHATEVER BUT INSTEAD OF JUST LOOK THE OTHER WAY AROUND MORE. OKAY WELL YOU'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR FIVE HOURS THIS DAY THREE HOURS THAT DAY. WHATEVER I MEAN. ADDED JUST WONDERING LIKE IF YOU'RE A SHE ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET TELL CARE PROVIDERS WHO WORK ON THAT KIND OF SCHEDULE AND TAKE KIDS CONSISTENTLY ON THAT KIND OF SCHEDULE. FOR THAT THAT CAN CERTAINLY BE A CALLENGE AS YOU ARTICULATED I THINK THAT WHAT WE SEEM COUNTIES TO TO TRY TO MITIGATE THAT SPECIFICALLY AS A BRAND NEW CAL EXPERTISE OF AN INTERCESSOR IS A VARIETY OF OPTIONS THEY DO TO TRY TO PROVIDE SOME IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THAT COULD. BE EVERYTHING FROM SUPPORTING A HAPPEN CHILD CARE ON SITES AT THE COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES SO AS THEIR PARTICIPATING IN ORIENTATIONS AND JOB SKILLS TRAINING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THEY HAVE CHILD CARE ON SITE. AT SOME COUNTIES ALSO CONTRACT WITH LOCAL AD CHECK YOUR CENTERS IN PROGRAMS NEARBY TO KIND OF AT HAVE THAT SPACE AVAILABLE -- FOR PARTICIPANTS BUT JUST IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL ACCESS AT THAT THE AUTHORIZATION IS WHAT THAT THE PARENT KNOWS THEY KNOW THEY ARE AUTHORIZED FOR CARE AT THAT SPECIFICITY OF THEIR ACTIVITIES AND THAT'S HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WHAT THEN -- THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WITH THE PROVIDER SO I THINK YOU COULD HEAR THAT SOME POVIDERS YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION IN TERMS OF WHAT PROVIDERS -- I PROVIDE SOME ONLY PROVIDE FULL TIME CARE SUMMER MORE FLEXIBLE PART TIME BUT THAT REALLY DOES VERY IN A VERY IS FOR THE AGE RANGE OF THE CHILD AS WELL. A AND A I'M ACTUALLY CURIOUS FROM THE THE I MEAN. WE HAVE PEOPLE TRY RUN CHILD CARE IS OUR REPRESENTS YOUR IS THAT GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW SO YOU KIND OF HAVE TO CHARGE MORE TO EVEN OUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE. AT THE PERSONS LIKE. IT NEEDS THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A SHIFTING STATE YOU HAVE A I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE TALES OF OBVIOUSLY WHAT OUR PRIORITIES THE THE THE THE CLIENT THE BENEFICIARY RIGHT IN THERE. AND HOW THEY HAVE TO MANAGE THAT I'M ALSO THINKING FROM THE IF YOU'RE A CHILD CARE PROVIDER NOW I REALIZE THE COUNTY RUNS AROUND ETCETERA. I THINK YOU THE COST OF RUNNING IT WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN WHO BASICALLY. THEIR THEIR HOURS ARE CONSTANTLY SHIFTING BECAUSE YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL INFRASTRUCTURE NOW. AND AND IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE OF GROUP OF CLASS I GO THE THE MATCH LIKE PUZZLE PIECES RIGHT SO BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT YOU MAY SOME THE HAVE A LARGER ENTRIES AND IT'S ONLY DROP RIGHT SO I AM ONE LEVEL BECAUSE A WELL WELL WE ONLY WE SHOULD. PAY FOR CHILD CARE ONLY FOR THE TIME THAT THEY NEED FOR VERY SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES AND BUT IT SLIPS I'M THINKING IS THAT CHILD CARE GOING TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE JUST BECAUSE A CHILD CARE PROVIDER HAS TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL I MEAN THEY DON'T HAVE CERTAIN TO EITHER SO. HOW THE HOW MUCH STAFF TO THEY HAVE HOW MUCH SPACE TO THE HAVE HOW MUCH SUPPLIES TODAY I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING LIKE IF I WAS A BUSINESS PERSON WHO HAD RUN THE CHILD CARE BUT THERE AND THAT? IS PERSON BECAUSE I OWN THE CHILD CARE OR EVEN JUST ON THE MANAGER FOR THE STATE HE FOR THE EIGHT COUNTY AGENCY THAT HAS TO MAINTAIN A CHILD CARE FACILITY. I WONDER IF SOMEONE LOOKED AT HOW WHAT THE COST OF DOING THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THIS. THIS VERY ABILITY -- TO YET IN IN IN YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR UP AT EIGHT EIGHT IS YOUR CLIENT ADDED THE NUMBER KIDS YOU HALF RIGHT AND AND AND THE AND THE RANGE OF THE AGES CELL. IT IS I'M JUST SORRY I'M STATE YES -- ABOUT THAT I DID HAVE A RACK SCHEDULE LIKE THAT TO HER -- LIKE MY JANITOR JOB I WAS WORKING FOR PM TO THREE AM AND THEN I HAD ANOTHER JOB THAT WAS ON CALL. I COULD PUT MY KID AN ACTUAL THE FACILITY I HAD TO GO THROUGH A FAMILY MEMBER AND HAVE THEM. BUT ON MY CONTRACTS THEY ACTUALLY HAD PUT VARIOUS TIMES THEY COULDN'T PUT LIKE SET TIMES FOR MY IMAGE FOR A JOB THAT WAS ON CALL. SO THEY KNEW THAT THERE IS AN TO BE SOME VARIOUS TIMES IN THERE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PAY MY MY FAMILY MEMBER. FOR THE FOR THE JANITORIAL JOB IT WAS JUST BETWEEN THOSE TIMES THAT THEY WOULD PAY [inaudible] FOR OKAY. I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT FOR ANYONE WHO HAS -- IN INTERMITTENT SCHEDULE A VARIABLE SCHEDULE NONTRADITIONAL HOURS THE ONLY OPTION IS -- LICENSE EXAM TO A FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR CARE AND WHEN YOU SAY WELL WOULDN'T THEY HAVE TO BE PAID MORE TO HOLD THAT SPACE OPEN THE ANSWER IS THAT THE STATE. SETS A CEILING ON HARASSMENT RATES SO THAT IS NOT AN OPTION AND AS A RESULT -- WE THINK THAT CREATING TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY AND THE OPTION OF FULL TIME CARE MEANS THAT PARENTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO A FULLER RANGE OF LICENSED QUALITY CHILDCARE OPTIONS THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF JUST THE A PROBLEMS YOU'VE IDENTIFIED AT WAS A MORE EXPENSIVE. IT'S DRAIN YOUR WILL SO WHAT WE DO IS A STATE WE CAP THAT REYES SO BUT THE PROBLEM IS I'M SAYING THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY OPERATED AND SAYS WELL I CAN'T TAKE IT'S LIKE THAT. BECAUSE IT WILL COST ME MORE IT'S NOT YOU KNOW AND AND AND IT'S GONNA COST ME MORE THAN TO AND JUST TRY TO WALK THROUGH THE PROBLEM AND JUST THINKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW TO BE SURE WE BUILD THAT CAPACITY FOR AVAILABLE CHILD CARE -- AND AND THEN FOR IT SO IT IS SOMETIMES SOMEONE BEING WHETHER REPAYING AND AGAIN I'M. THAT ARE SORT OF RUN NUMBERS ANYTHING BUT I'VE WAS EYES WONDER WHETHER BEING PENNY WISE POUND FOOLISH SIX I COULD SEE PEOPLE SAID WELL YOU KNOW THIS IS THE WAY TO SAVE MONEY WHICH ONLY PROVIDE CHILDCARE FOR VERY SPECIFIC THINGS BECAUSE THAT MAKE. IT WOULD WHILE SPEND MONEY ON DOUBT THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE TO KIDS OF THOSE OTHER TIMES AND YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE PAYING FOR IT BUT IN THE END IF YOU'RE DEPENDING ON THAT UNIVERSE OF THINGS. YOU MAY END UP WITH A SITUATION WHERE IT'S YOU CREATING THIS OKAY I'M PAYING FOR THIS MANY HOURS THE STATUS THE HOURS THAT THEY KNOW HOURS THAT DAY YOU KNOW THAT IT THAT IT THINKING ABOUT THE PERSON I SEE IS PROVIDE THAT SERVICE THAT. THE RAD. THAT KIND OF A RADIC UP. COVERAGE MAY NOT EVEN MAKE SENSE FOR THEM EITHER RIGHT -- SO -- AND AND THEY ARE AT AND THEN I'LL TOP LAYER ON TOP OF THAT OF COURSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET. THEM INTO WORK AND OFTEN TIMES THE FIRST JOB YOU CAN GET IS PROBABLY KIND OF THE SITE. PEACE WORK IN -- CETERA THAT'S IT SO. I'M HOPING THAT -- I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AND ASSERTS THINKING DESERVE THANK YOU KNOW LIKE. OPERATIONALLY DOES THIS MAKE SENSE TO DO IT THE WAY WE'RE DOING AND I THINK THAT'S AND AND WHAT IS REALLY THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT RIGHT SIZE SO -- I'LL JUST ADD NAY A MENTION THIS IN IN MY EARLIER REMARKS LIKE THAT AB PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IT WHEN IN THIS IS THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM BETA HOME VISITING INITIATIVE. IS MAKING THAT EARLY CONNECTION TO A QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM HAVING THAT CONVERSATION BEFORE THE PARENT ESSENTIALLY IS SUBJECTED TO THE WELFARE TO WORK REQUIREMENTS SO HOPING THAT. ENGAGEMENT CAN HAPPEN THAT EARLY IN THAT CONNECTION -- TO PROVIDE THAT CONTINUITY GOING IN SO THAT AGAIN WE ARE WORKING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT BETTER OKAY SO IS A USER SOME EFFORT TO LOOKS MORE STRATEGICALLY IT'S STILL A MOVE IN THE START AT LEAST IN THE THREE YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE. EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE SAGE ONE BUT THE THIRD TOP UP TAKE AND WE SAY WELL PEOPLE PREFER TO HAVE FAMILIES TO PAY FOR TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S REASON AS SOMEONE STEPPED BACK AND SAID LET'S JUST LOOK STRATEGICALLY AT THIS. STAGE ONE THING. YES MY ALSO AT APPRECIATE AND THINGS ARE SAGE ONE TOUCH AND NOTHING. SHE'S ALSO PART OF THAT FACILITATING A COW WORKS CHILD CARE INTERAGENCY WORK GROUPS AND BOTH THIS DEPARTMENT. AND THE DEPARTMENT YOU CATION AS HAVE BEEN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SO YES KIND OF LOOKING AT HOLISTICALLY AT WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE FROM HE CLIENTS PERSPECTIVE IS SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT IS ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT AND WHERE WHERE CAN WE ENSURE AS AS WAS MENTIONED THERE. AREN'T ANY DESTRUCTION POINTS ALONG THE WAY THAT'S A SEAMLESS SYSTEM THAT THE POLICIES ARE LINED WE DID PUT OUT SOME JOINT GUIDANCE AS A RESULT OF AS SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THIS INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP LAST FALL BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION SOCIAL SERVICES AROUND. NOT DISCONTINUING -- A FAMILY AS THE TRANSFER MAKING SURE THAT THE STAGE TO A CONTRACTOR HAS FULLY AT IN ROLLED THEM PRIOR TO ANY DISCONTINUANCE THE STAGE ONE SO WE YES WE ARE WE ARE. LOOKING HOLISTICALLY AT SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES AND CONTINUE TO FIND IN AN IDENTIFY NEW WAYS FOR IMPROVED. YEAH I MEAN CERTAINLY CLIENT SHOULD COME FIRST BUT AS ND I APPRECIATE THE CLIENTS PERSPECTIVE I'M ALSO THINKING ABOUT ANY AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY LANDS. I ALSO THINKING ABOUT WELL WHAT IMPLICATIONS DECISIONS WERE MAKING HAVE ON AVAILABILITY RIGHT ON THE EXISTING CAPACITY OUT THERE. AND WHAT WE REALLY EXPECTING RIGHT SO IF A EXPECTING OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING. MATCHING UP WITH THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT LIES IT DELETE PROVIDE THAT IT AND I EVEN TALK I'M TALKING ABOUT LIKE A RADIC SCHEDULES RIGHT I MEAN SORRY HARD ENOUGH.-CLIENTS WITH THEIR SCHEDULES AND I HAPPENS IS AND SO. IT IS SO IT GETS ITS ARE THINKING ABOUT THE SYSTEMATIC ISSUES KIND OF THING SO ALL RIGHT. QUESTION ABOUT THAT I WOULD JUST GUESSING CLIENTS SAY THAT. THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC PARTNER IN THIS EFFORT TO BOTH THINK ABOUT HOW TO CREATE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AND TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST OPERATIONALIZE THEM AND YOU KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS AND BELIEVE IT. THAT'S THE WAY WILL CREATE THE BEST POLICY THAT REALLY DOES SIR FAMILIES AS WELL AS AS YOU MENTIONED THE PROVIDERS. WHO THEMSELVES HAVE FAMILIES? AND ARE TRYING TO CREATE A BUSINESS MODEL BASED ON PROVIDING GOOD QUALITY CHILDCARE. OKAY. AND AN ADVENTURELAND OUR CURRENT BUDGET CHAIR FORMER CHAIR THE SUBCOMMITTEE ACTUALLY RAN A CHILD CARE FRIDAY MAY HAVE SOME OTHER ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON THAT AS WELL BUT OKAY. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY -- WHEN WE MOVE ON THEN TO THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE -- WILL BE ABOUT THE ISSUE THREE CAL WORKS GRANT INCREASES. IT WAS GOOD TALKING TO INCREASES IN THE GOVERNOR. ALSO THE BUDGET PROPOSES SIGNIFICANT INCREASE -- TO THE TOWERS GROUND LEVEL BY THIRTEEN POINT 1% EFFECTIVE OCTOBER FIRST THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE 10% THAT WENT INTO EFFECT THIS MONTH APRIL. I WHICH WILL BRING THE MONTHLY GRANT PAYMENTS UP 250% OF THE PROJECTED TWENTY NINETEEN FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IN A CONTINUES TO BUILD ON ON WE LOOK WE LOOK FOR TO THOSE INCREASES AS FAR AS THE CASELOAD IMPACT OF THOSE GRANTS. THE QUESTION IS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF A USE INCLUDE THE INELIGIBLE. UNNEEDED FAMILY MEMBERS -- THE CONCENTRATION OF THOSE CASES WITHOUT -- IN A TO THE DOLE IS MOSTLY IN A YOU OF ONE APPROXIMATELY 80% OF EIGHT OF A YOU OF ONE OUR CASES WITHOUT AN ON AN EIGHT EIGHT ADULT. BASED ON THE MAP LEVELS AFTER THIS OCTOBER FIRST THE TWENTY NINETEEN INCREASED APPROXIMATELY BELOW THE FRONT AND FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND CONSIDERED KIND OF THE FURTHEST AWAY FROM THAT 50% TARGET -- THAT 27% REPRESENTS PRIMARILY A USE OF ONE OF THE SOME SMALL PERCENTAGE ADDITIONS OF A USE OF EIGHT OR MORE. WITH REGARDS TO THE QUESTION ON THE LA OWES THIRD OPTION E DO BELIEVE IT CAN BE OPERATIONALIZED THIS PROPOSAL WOULD WOULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FUNDING OVER WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED IN THE CURRENT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET [inaudible] OKAY. ALLEVIATE SOME COMMENTS THAT AND ALSO QUESTION FOR YOU DIFFERENT OPTIONS YES THANK YOU. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED THIRTEEN POINT 1% ACROSS THE BOARD GRAN INCREASE DIFFERS IN SEVERAL KEY RESPECTS FROM THE LAN THAT WAS ADOPTED AS PART OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. IN OUR VIEW IT'S CLEARLY A STEP IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND SO IS AN INCOMPATIBLE -- WE THINK THE% LEGISLATURE SHOULD AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE SHOULD CONSIDER SORT OF ITS OPTIONS IN RECONCILING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PLANS -- THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH APPROACH IS ACROSS THE BOARD TO EACH. ARE A YOU WOULD RECEIVE A GRANT INCREASE OF THE SAME PERCENTAGE AMOUNT. ON THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN THE GRANT INCREASES WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED DIFFERENTLY. IN IN SPECIFICALLY A LARGER GRANT INCREASE WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO IN PARTICULAR THE A USE OF ONE WHICH UNDER CURRENT LAW ARE FURTHEST FROM 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. TO SORT OF AN OPTION OF WHICH DIRECTION TO TO FOLLOW AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET -- WE THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE ALTERNATIVES TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN COULD CONSIDER IF IT WANTED TO PURSUE -- NOW COM THAT WAS MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH ITS EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PLAN HOT ONE OPTION IS TO WORK WITHIN THE THE PROPOSED BUDGETARY AMOUNT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. FOR THE BUDGET YEAR BUT INSTEAD OF PROVIDING A GRAND INCREASE ACROSS THE BOARD DISTRIBUTE THOSE SORT OF TARGETED IN A TARGETED FASHION SUCH THAT ALL. ALL A USER PART GRAHAM LEVELS ARE BROUGHT TO THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WE THINK THAT WOULD BE ABOUT 48% OF THE FPL THAT'S ONE OPTION -- ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE COULD MOVE FORWARD WITH ITS -- PLAN AS OUTLINED IS IN PART OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACTS. THAT WOULD. OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD INCREASE GRANT LEVELS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN WHAT IS PROPOSED ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS A DEPARTMENT MENTIONED -- BECAUSE NOT ONLY WOULD GRANT LEVELS BE INCREASED 250% OF THE FPL UNDER THE LEGISLATURE'S PLAN IT WOULD BE 50% THE F. P. L. THAT CORRESPONDS. WITH THE FAMILY THAT'S ONE PERSON LARGER THAN THE COW WORKS ASSISTANCE UNIT ARE MINDFUL THAT MANY CAO WORKS CASES DO INCLUDE IN AN ELIGIBLE FAMILY MEMBER -- SO THERE'S A SORT OF THE OPTIONS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFICS OKAY.ZERO DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON ON THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY CAROL WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- YES ACTUALLY WE HAVE A WILL A WITNESS HERE TODAY WHOSE EXACTLY THE KIND OF CASE IS THAT -- THE ONLY -- JUST DESCRIBED -- WHERE WE HAD SHE CHAIR IT WAS DURING THAT AND SHE IS THAT SHE'S SINGLE DAUGHTER BUT SHE'S TIME OFF OF THE SYSTEMS SHE SAID HER FORTY EIGHT MONTH LIMIT? SOMETHING WE HOPE YOU'LL ADDRESS DURING THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BY THE WAY -- BUT UNDER THE UNDER THE PROPOSAL PUT FORTH BY THE GOVERNOR -- HER GRANT LEVEL WOULD STILL BE I BELIEVE IT FORTY TWO OR 43% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND AGAIN WE ARE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON THIS. WE JUST HAD A 10% GRANT INCREASE NOW WE HAVE A 13% INCREASE. ON TOP OF THAT IN THE SAME CALENDAR YEAR. THESE ARE REALLY HUGE STEPS THAT WERE MAKING AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES -- HOWEVER WE WOULD PREFER THE APPROACH I THINK THAT WAS. PUT FORTH BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR IN WHICH WE WOULD RAISE GRANT LEVELS EXPRESSLY FOR AND WHAT WE THINK ARE VERY VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS OF STUFF BUT I'VE DESCRIBED AS SORT OF A LEGAL FICTION. THAT THESE ARE HOUSEHOLDS OF ONE IN FACT THERE ARE NO SUCH THING THEY'RE ALWAYS AT LEAST A TWO PERSON HOUSEHOLD AND THE PATH OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR WOULD BE INCREASE YOU WOULD BE PUTTING MORE FUNDING INCREASING THOSE GRANT LEVELS HIGHER. AND THEN IN TWO YEARS OUT WE WOULD BE GETTING TO WHAT THE LA -- DESCRIBE WHICH WOULD BE 50% PLUS ONE ADDITIONAL PERSON IN THAT. CASE LOAD AND THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT. NO FAMILY EVEN WHERE WE HAVE AN EXCLUDED ADULT. IS BELOW 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND THAT'S WHAT WAS THE LEGISLATURE DROVE TOWARD IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR. AND WHILE WE AGAIN APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR TAKING A VERY LARGE IMPORTANT STEP THIS YEAR -- WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP WITH THE DEAL AND TO PUT A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY IN THE BUDGET IN THIS YEAR SO WE STAY ON THAT PATH TO GET TO WHERE WE AGREE TO LAST YEAR. SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S OUR THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHIEF THIS YEAR. THANK YOU THAT COMES FROM FINANCE. IT'S ONLY IT'S A QUESTION -- SO. THE PRE SHEET FIRST OF ALL I THINK GOVERNOR -- FOR FOR FOR RELATIONAL INCREASE -- AND IS PROPOSAL AND CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE'RE IN LEGISLATURE'S VERY OPEN. TO LIKE THE IDEA -- IT'S BEEN THEY'LL. RECOGNIZE THAT COVERS POSING A CROSS THE BOARD CUT ONLY SAYS HISTORICAL CONTENT I MEAN IT COULD HAVE A GOOD CAR SUPPORT INCREASE OUR INCREASE ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASE SORRY. YOU KNOW I DID COME IN THE RECESSION -- THE BUT SO OF COURSE FOR THE REASON AB SO WEISS'S STRUGGLE REASON THE YOU ONE IS SO FAR BEHIND. THIS WAS A POLICY THAT DROVE THAT OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE I MEAN BECAUSE WE WERE DOING A GREAT THAT I MEAN. THIS WAS LIKE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE DOING ACROSS BOARD INCREASE PERCENTAGE INCREASE. THE REASON -- BEHIND BECAUSE THEY WERE STARTED BEHIND SO WHY A WISE AN EIGHTY ONE SO FAR BELOW EVERYONE ELSE. NOW YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION -- THIS IS LONG AS I'VE BEEN WORKING AT CAL WORKS GRANTS GOING BACK AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS THE CIRCUMSTANCES ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE -- IT WAS A DECISION MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE NGUYEN IN THE OLD A FDC DAYS -- IT AND IT'S A DECISION THAT THIS LET THE CURRENT LEGISLATURE COULD CHOOSE TO FIX IT'S JUST A POLICY AND BUDGETARY DECISION. THAT HAS STOOD THE TEST OF TIME UNFORTUNATELY AND ONE THAT WE HOPE IS GOING TO GET REVISITED OKAY SO THIS IS A REALLY LONG STANDING AREA. OKAY I'M GONNA SPECULATE BECAUSE I WAS A DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE SPECULATE THAT IF IT WAS THAT LONG AGO THAT PROBABLY PEOPLE SAID -- YOU KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY A SINGLE. PERSON DOESN'T HAVE KIDS WE DON'T KNOW WE'RE WORRIED WE THOUGHT OF A LOSS OF THE FEE AND THAT THEY SHOULD GET ON FULL OF THEIR BOOTSTRAPS AND GET THE WORK IS THAT -- PERHAPS WAS GOING ON BACK THEN THAT'S BEFORE LIMITS TO WHERE PEOPLE WITH SO I DON'T KNOW IS THAT MY GUESSING WRONG MAYBE. THE GAP BETWEEN THE ONE PERSON IN THE TWO PERSON HOUSEHOLD SIDE IS WELL OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IT'S SUCH A LARGE GAP IT'S HARD EVEN JUST TO FIND THE GROUNDS A YOU JUST DELIVERED. HI HI. I THINK YOU PROBABLY AT SOME POINT WAS BASED ON THE ON THE OLD STANDARD THAT WE HAD AROUND THE THE EMBASSY SACK AS WE CALL IT THE MINIMUM BASIC STANDARD ADEQUATE CARE. AND THAT -- WAS SOMEWHAT CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE POVERTY LEVEL FOR THAT INCOME SIZE AS OF POVERTY WEALTH OF ADJUSTED OVERTIME AND WE'VE STOP USING THE OF THE SACK AS A WAY BE SECOND RANTS. THINGS I THINK JUST GOT EXTENDED OUT OF WHACK OVER TIME OKAY. SO LET ME JUST SAID AND LET ME POSE QUESTION DIRECTED IS ANSWERED IT I DON'T KNOW YEAH I'LL TRY THE EASIEST THING IS LET'S DEAL WITH IT WE HAVE MONEY WILL DO OAK TREES ACROSS THE BOARD I MEAN THIS THIS THE IN TERMS OF POLICY. ISSUE HAVING THIS DISPARITY BETWEEN AN EIGHTY ONE AND FOR WHATEVER HISTORICAL REASONS I SAID I'D TO SPECULATE NO EVIDENCE FOR ANYTHING AND I THINK YOU BROUGHT SOME OTHER. POINTS UP BUT AGAIN REALLY HISTORICAL -- DO IS -- POLICY ISSUE WITH SAYING THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO GET THE YOU KNOW EVEN THIS AT IN TERMS OF GETTING A YOU ONE OUT -- SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE SUCH A DISPARITY BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT -- THAT SYSTEM UNIT SIZES. A I THINK TO AT WHAT MR ALAMO OUTLINED IN LA WAS OUTLINED HERE -- I THINK THAT'S THOSE ARE THE CHOICES THAT THAT CAN BE MADE SIX CERTAINLY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION BUT I JUST CHECKING THE MINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE ANY POLICY ISSUES WITH THE IDEA OF TRYING. TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS THAT WE BASICALLY SAID WE DON'T THERE'S NO POLICY REASON TO HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF RELATIVE -- BENEFITS FOR DIFFERENT SIZE ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS. I THINK AT THIS POINT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON THAT SPECIFICALLY BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THIRTEEN POINT 1% ACROSS THE BOARD WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED LAST WAS. TARGETING THOSE HOUSEHOLDS OF TWO AND THREE WHICH MAKE UP OVER HALF OF THE CAL WORKS CASELOAD. BUT WE COULD CERTAINLY REVISIT IF IT'S LEGISLATURE'S INTENT TO REDISTRIBUTE THAT OKAY WELL I I YOU KNOW I I SAW THE DIVINE LEVELS THE MONEY WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS BUDGET COMMITTEE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT FIVE ALSO THERE'S AN UNDERLYING POLICY ISSUE RIGHT. AND I THINK -- AND THEN THEIR HEAD ASSESS PRICE OF HISTORICAL ROOTS WHICH WE MAY NOT KNOW IN THE MISTS OF TIME -- BUT I'M JUST WONDERING BASICALLY HE WOULD WHO ARE PERPETUATING THAT WHATEVER THAT POLICY CHOICE WAS BACK THEN. YOU KNOW MAYBE -- AND SO THINKING LIKE IS THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE FIXING IS MAYBE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT EITHER OF OUR WORK. FOLLOW ARE INCORRECT NOW RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE NOW THE SITUATION IS IS THAT -- AND I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S EMPHASIS ON YOU KNOW TREAT ON CHILDREN OF PEDIATRICIAN A FATHER -- AND THE A. S. IT STATES THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSEHOLDS THAT DEPARTED REASON THE TEN A. L. MYSTERY OF UNIT ONE IS BECAUSE THERE MAY BE OTHER PEOPLE IN HOUSEHOLD. TWO DISCS FIRE SIDE METED OUT BITS THAT MAY NOT BE WHAT PEOPLE CONCEIVE THAT MY ASSUME THE HOUSEHOLD IS CORRECT. IS THAT IT GETS THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING. YEAH. COMMENTS FROM LA ABOUT THAT. I MEAN TO JUST. BRIEFLY WE'RE NOT AWARE OF HISTORICAL. SORT OF REASON FOR THIS THE DISTRIBUTION OF OF GRANTS ACROSS THE A USE NOW AN SIMILARLY. THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS IN A PERFECT MEASURE. DIFFERENCES AMONG FAMILY SIZES -- IT MIGHT BE MORE STANDARD -- I'M SPECULATING BUT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF THAT SORT OF EXISTING. STORY SO TO SPEAK OF OF WHY THE GRANTS ARE ARE THE WAY THEY ARE TODAY. WELL THIS IS THE SITE OF HER WELL UNDERLYING WHATEVER WE'RE DOING RIGHT AND THIS IS THE UNDERLYING IT THERE IS. WHETHER EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY. SOME DECISION WAS MADE WAY BACK WHEN THAT ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT OF ONLY WIND SHOULD GET A LOT LESS RELATIVE TO TWO OR MORE. RIGHT. AND FOR WHATEVER REASONS AND SO. I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS NOW IS IS THAT FOR WHATEVER AND AGAIN APPRECIATE GOVERNOR PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THIS. IS THAT DO WE WE CAN SIMPLY SAY WE GIVE MORE MONEY WEEK PERPETUATE THAT DIFFERENCE ABOUT BC THEY'RE GOING TO BENEFIT TO OR DO WE SAY THAT. KNOW WHAT WE LOOK BACK POLICY WAS WHATEVER REASON THAT HAPPENED BEFORE MAYBE THAT'S NOT SUCH A GOOD THING WE SHOULD CONTINUE NOW YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY ALSO UNDERSTAND ON THE DESIRE TO GET MORE RESOURCES TO YOUR FAMILY ON THE OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS. SO I AM NOT A CHANCE THAT BUT THAT THE I GUESS I'M TRYING TO DIG BACK INTO LIKE DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT SIZE ONE BE SO DESPERATE FROM. THE OTHER ONES. RIGHT I THINK THAT THAT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T MAKE THAT POLICY NONE OF US WERE HERE PROBABLY WANT TO HAPPEN DOWN ON TO THE VOTE WAS PRIDE VERY YOUNG BUT I HAD NO IDEA I WAS A PART OF IT BUT I'M JUST. I'M JUST RAISING THAT ISSUE BECAUSE I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL TO STEP BACK AND SAY WHAT IS OR WHAT DO WE WANT TO POLICY CALPERS TO BE. REGARDS TO THAT. SO HOPEFULLY THAT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT BUT THE DISCUSSION IS WORTH THINKING TOWARD MEET MAY REVISE -- THAT -- AND EVEN EVEN BEYOND IF WE DON'T DECIDE TO FIX IT RIGHT AWAY -- BUT I I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY IN THE LEGISLATURE WE FIRST THOUGHT ABOUT OUR PLAN I THINK THAT WAS PART. DISCUSSION WAS KIND OF LIKE WELL WE DON'T SEE WHY THAT THEY SHOULD BE SO DESPERATE AND MAYBE SHOULD TYPING EVERY THING ALL THE VOTES UP TO THE SAME LEVEL. CELL. BUT IF THERE'S A GOOD POLICY RATIONALLY KEEP THAT DIFFERENCE I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO HEARING IT BUT I'M NOT HEARING IT YET SELF OKAY. ANYTHING ELSE IN. ALL RIGHT. BUT I THINK IN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE GOVERNOR. FOR FUNDING FOR THE BEING TOO SELF BY TWO IF WE DO. THE LACK OF GRATITUDE THERE FOR THAT OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER ON THE COW WORKS GRAN INCREASE WERE ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT WANNA. ALAINA MY COMMENTS WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE WESTERN CENTER. WELCOME AT A FREE NEW BURGER FROM THE CHILD CARE LAWCENTER ALSO ALIGNING MY COMMENTS WITH WESTERN CENTER REGARDING THE CAL WORKS GRANT INCREASES. AND SUPPORTING THE TRUST LINE A TECHNICAL FIX OKAY. THANK YOU AND THIS IS ONE MORE PERSON COMING UP [inaudible] JACKIE. ONE AGAIN WITH GRAYSON AND HELP OUR IN CALIFORNIA -- JUST WANT TO SUPPORT THE COW WITH INCREASES IN THE ADVOCATE PROPOSALS THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. RIGHT SEEN ALSO THE MICROPHONE WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUES NUMBER SEVEN WE HAVE I BELIEVE EIGHT PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENT SO -- ALL RIGHT SO LET'S START OFF WITH US STRENGTHENING THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD AND WE HAVE FRANK MECCA IS A RADIO BUT THE THANKFUL THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN AND WHILE I A MUCH YOUNGER THAN KEVIN AS LANEY AND I WAS HERE. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE -- CONSTRUCTED THE CALYX PROGRAMS IN. NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND AT THAT TIME IT WAS A BIPARTISAN BILL WAS SIGNED BY THEN GOVERNOR PETE WILSON AND ONE OF THE CORE TENANTS OF CAL WORKS WITH THAT WORK SHOULD PAY. FOR WELFARE RECIPIENTS WHO DO THE HARD WORK TO MOVE INTO THE WORK FORCE THEY SHOULDN'T BE SO UNDULY PENALIZE THAT THEY LOSE THEIR SUPPORT. AND SO THE LEGISLATURE OPERATIONALIZE THAT TENET IN A COUPLE OF WAYS IN THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARDS ONE OF THEM. THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD IS A FEATURE THAT ALLOWS CLIENTS TO RETAIN A PORTION OF THEIR EARNINGS. SINCE -- AND A PORTION OF THEIR GRANTS. UNTIL THEIR INCOME IS SUFFICIENTLY IGH ENOUGH THAT WE THINK THAT THEY CAN MANAGE THE TRANSITION TO SELF SUFFICIENCY WITHOUT CONTINUED SUPPORT. AS THE EARNINGS GROW THE THE GRANT GRADUALLY SHALLOWS -- AND SO CLIENTS COULD COMBINE EARNINGS THERE GRANT AND OTHER WORK SUPPORTS LIKE CHILD CARE AND TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER TYPES OF ASSISTANCE -- AND HAVE A GRADUAL BRIDGE TO SELF SUFFICIENCY. THE PROBLEM IS THE WORK INCENTIVE -- THAT WAS CREATED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS HAS DEGRADED SIGNIFICANTLY BY ALMOST 50%. IT HASN'T BEEN UPGRADED IN THE TWENTY YEARS TWENTY TWO YEARS SENSE CAL WORKS WAS CREATED. AND SO INFLATION AND INCREASES IN THE MINIMUM WAGE OF DEGRADED THE VALUE. HAD THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD WHICH IS CURRENTLY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND THEN INCOME. AT THAT -- DISREGARD BEEN UPDATED FOR INFLATION AND THE MINIMUM WAGE IT WOULD CURRENTLY BE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND 50% TO ALMOST DOUBLE. AS A RESULT WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS MORE OF A CLIFF THAN A BRIDGE -- AND IT'S JEOPARDIZING THE SUCCESS OF HELPING -- MOVE PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK AND GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY CENTER -- IN THERE EXCELLENT RECENT ANALYSIS A PERSON WHO WAS WORKING AT A FULL TIME MINIMUM WAGE JOB AND CAL WORK STARTED -- WOULD STILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR A MODEST GRANT AND THE OTHER SUPPORT FROM THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM. A PERSON TODAY EARNING MINIMUM WAGE IS OFF CAL WORKS -- WITHOUT A GRANT AND WITHOUT THOSE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES LIKE TRANSPORTATION. IT'S A TERRIBLE CATCH TWENTY TWO FOR CLIENTS. THEY ARE FACED WITH THE CHOICE OF ACCEPTING MORE WORK -- BUT PERHAPS BEING PUSHED OFF THE PROGRAM IN THE LOSING THE CRITICAL SUPPORTS THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN THEIR CONNECTION TO THE WORK FORCE. THAT SAME CLIENT IN -- AT THE BEGINNING OF CAL WORKS FACED A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY MARKET THAT WAS THREE TIMES LESS EXPENSIVE. RENTS HAVE HAVE RAISED THREE TIMES THE RATE OF WAGES AND INFLATION AND SO THAT CLIENT TODAY WHO IS NOW OFF A ALSO FACES AN UNPRECEDENTEDLY UNPRECEDENTED EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKET. TO OUR PROPOSAL IS TO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS REYES THAT THE DISREGARD -- TO ACCOUNT -- FOR THAT MINIMUM WAGE AND AND CURRENT AND SCHEDULED TO MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES AND INFLATION. IT WOULD PHASE IN OVER TWO YEARS TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AND 50% AND THERE AND THEN GOING FORWARD IT WOULD BE INDEXED -- FOR FOR INFLATION -- WERE NOT INCREASING THE GENEROSITY OF THE DISREGARD AS WE PROBABLY SHOULD -- BUT WE THINK THAT IT -- IT'S AN IMPORTANT -- POLICY THAT WOULD ALSO HELP US WITH THE FEDERAL W. P. R. BECAUSE THOSE CLIENTS WHO ARE KICKED OFF OF AID. PREMATURELY ARE ALSO KICKED OUT OF OUR DENOMINATOR -- IN OUR NUMERATOR AND SO IT WOULD HELP US MAINTAIN OUR FEDERAL COMPLIANCE AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU. COMES FROM THE SOCIAL SERVICES. THANK YOU THE OTHER PERSON RECOGNIZES THAT THE ID IS OVERDUE FOR AN UPDATE ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING AS MR MY CONNOTED ON GOING IN PLAN UPDATES TO THE MINIMUM WAGE AND SUPPORTS PROGRESS THAT ALLOWS INCENTIVIZE IS FAMILIES TO ENGAGE IN THE WORK FORCE WHILE STABILIZING IN DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL SKILLS. IN OVERCOMING. ADVERSITY THE DEPARTMENT ENCOURAGES THE CONSIDERATION -- OF ALL THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EXAMINING THOSE FISCAL RESULTS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE LEGISLATORS PRIORITIES IN THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES. I THANK YOU AND I WILL RECOGNIZE THAT -- FINANCIAL POINT OUTSIDE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND ALSO THE AGENCY LAST RECOGNIZE NOT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT BEYOND THAT I APPRECIATE THE TECHNICAL COMMENTS. THAT LEO. SIMILARLY -- WE'VE BEEN REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL AND ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF AS THE SUBCOMMITTEE THINGS. THANK YOU FINANCE. CITY IRENE I KNOW IT IS A ALL RIGHT BUT IF YOU EVER HAVE ANY MORE YES CENTER STONE. I JUST WANT TO SAY IT -- IT MAY NOT BE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT I THINK YOU MAKE AVERY VALID ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY WE SHOULD BE ENTERTAINING THIS BECAUSE WE WANT TO JUST PUSH PEOPLE ARE. ARTIFICIALLY OVER THE CLIFF UNTIL THEY'RE READY TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT SO. YOU'RE IN CONTROL THE MINIMUM WAGE YOU DON'T CONTROL ACOSTA HOUSING AND SO I THINK IT'S A VERY -- BENEFICIAL REQUEST THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND TELLING US ABOUT IT. AND I TO THINK. I MEAN CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT OF FUN GOOD POLICY RATIONALE FOR I GUESS IS HAS ANYONE LOOKED AT AND I KNOW TO BE HARD TO STUDY BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT SOMEONE'S APPROACHING IT THEN IS MAKING CERTAIN DECISIONS SO THEY MAY MAKE DIFFERENT DECISIONS IF THE INCOME DISREGARD. BUT ENOUGH TO TO ME. YEAH WE TALK ABOUT THE PLANNING PHASE LOAD BECAUSE ECONOMIES CONTINUE TO PROVE -- BUT ALSO TO WHAT DEGREE ARE WE ARE PEOPLE -- THEM FOR GOING OUR OPPORTUNITIES TO EVENTUALLY GET OFF RIGHT BECAUSE THE FOOD BECAUSE THE ISSUE ISN'T THAT -- L. CAL WORKS I'M JUST NOW GETTING WELFARE AND GETTING YOU KNOW CHECKS FROM THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT IT'S ABOUT ALL SPORTS. AND SO THEY LOSE EVERYTHING RIGHT AND SO AND THEN THERE'S LESS LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE TRIED TO BUILD THIS THING AROUND THAT WAS KIND OF PART OF THE DEAL -- SO -- YOU KNOW I AM JUST WONDERING LIKE IF WE HAD IF WE RAISE THIS REGARD BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS GOING COST X. NUMBER DOLLARS BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE UP OF WHAT ELSE BUT IF WE DON'T DO IT. WHEN OVERFLOWED WE FOR GOING OUT OF THERE'S ANYBODY'S I'D DONE ANY SORT OF A LOOK I KNOW IT'S REALLY HARD THING TO FIGURE OUT? AS IT WENT IN ANY ASSESSMENT AS TO THERE WAS RESEARCH THAT WE BASED CALYX ON THAT SHOW THE POLICIES LIKE EARNED INCOME DISREGARDS ACTUALLY DID INCREASE WORK. AND INCREASE OUR CONNECTION TO THE WORK FORCE AND REDUCE YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF COMING BACK ON TO THE CAL ARTS PROGRAM. IT WAS BASED ON SOLID RESEARCH I DON'T THINK WE'VE. WE'VE LOOKED FROM A RESEARCH STANDPOINT ABOUT HOW HOW MUCH WE'VE LOST THOSE ADVANTAGES AS THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD -- HAS ERODED BUT BASED ON THE SCIENCE THAT THE DID THAT THE DISREGARD IS BASED ON IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S CLEARLY THE CASE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE TURNING BACK ON TO THE ROLES. WHO WOULDN'T BE -- BECAUSE THAT THE INCENTIVE AND THE SUPPORT HAS HAS WANED -- AND AND MY CONCERN IS IS THAT NOW WE HAVE A CLOCK SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MAIN APPEAL TURNED BACK BECAUSE THE CLOCK RAN OUT BUT NOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FAMILIES TO BOTH CAN'T GET IT BECAUSE OF THE CLOCK. BUT WE ALSO SET THEM UP FOR FAILURE SO I MEAN I'M JUST WHINING ABOUT THE COST OF THAT. NOW I MEAN AS WE AS AS WE LOOK AT THE COST OF AT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DSS. I THINK WE WE OUGHT TO LOOK FOR F. NOT STE YOU KNOW SCIENCE BUT AT LEAST SOME PROXY VARIABLES. TO ESTIMATE THE LIKELY REDUCE CHURN EFFECT OF MAKING THIS KIND OF INVESTMENT. OF ANY THEM THAT IT COVER IN ADDITION I'D LIKE TO NOTE IN WE'VE PROVIDED THIS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS HE TO BE DAY WILL MAKE YOU AWARE OF IT AS WELL THAT THERE'S POTENTIAL COST pSAVINGS IN ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS WITH INCREASING THE INCOME REPORTING THRESHOLD ALONG SIDE THE E. ID -- AS A POTENTIAL COST SAVING AND STABILIZING MECHANISM ALONG SIDE. OKAY WELL LIKE THAT TO SELL ALL RIGHT. OKAY SO YEAH I I MEAN I THINK THAT. THE HOPEFULLY I REALIZE AS A BIG I MEAN WE'RE WORKING OUT THE NUMBER HAS A SOMEWHAT YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE PRICE TAG BUT ADDED MINIMUM AND I'M HOPING WE CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT MINIMUM AT LEAST TO A PILOT AND GET SOME MORE DATA. RIGHT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE REALLY. NO. I MEAN I'M. I THINK THAT'S NOT GONNA CLASSES MUCH AS WE THINK IT IS THAT'S WHY I WONDER. AND AND THAT THAT THAT THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE THAT'S THAT'S WHY THESE THINGS LIKE. IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW DO WE REALLY AND IT'S EASY TO SAY WELL IT'S GONNA COST EXT NUMBER BECAUSE NOW THE NOW THIS MAY PEOPLE THAT SET UP IT'S NOT A STREAMLINED CALCULATION RIGHT. AND SAID IF WE CAN DO ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES PEOPLE GALLON BEING ABLE TO COME OFF AND STAY OFF. AND BE IN THE WORKPLACE -- THAT IS HARDER TO CAPTURE THAT THAT COSTS SO I'D TELL I'M NOT A BAD WAY I'M NOT PROPOSING TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD DO PILE INSTEAD BUT IF WE FOR SOME REASON CAN'T GET TO BE CONVINCED PEOPLE AT LIKE WE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND MUCH BIGGER BUDGET ITEMS. BASED ON HARD DATA THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT REASONABLE PEOPLE MAKE REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION. AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS PROPOSAL I BELIEVE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO BEST NUMBER TO CAL WORKS TWO POINT OH AUTOMATION I THINK YOU'RE UP AGAINST DOCTOR PAN THIS IS A ONE TIME -- FUNDING REQUEST OF ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO AUTOMATE TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AS PART OF THAT CAL WORKS TO PLANO PROJECT. SO THE DSS FOLKS TOLD YOU ABOUT CAL OR IN AS A COMPANION TO CAL OR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN PARTNERING. WITH MATHEMATICA POLICY RESEARCH AND OTHER -- AND UP AND ENGAGING ADVOCATES AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF. TO IMPROVE THE WAY WE DO CASE WORK TO TRY TO TO TRY TO GET AT THIS MORE HOLISTIC BROADER SAID ABOUT CALMS -- THE UTILIZING BRAIN SCIENCE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH -- ON HOW ADULTS LEARN AND BUILD CRITICAL SKILLS. IT'S A CULTURE SHIFT AWAY FROM THE COMPLIANCE DRIVEN. CASE MANAGEMENT APPROACH IN TOWARD ONE THAT'S BASED ON RESPONSIVE REAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE CASE MANAGER IN A CUSTOMER -- BASED ON IDENTIFYING PLANNING AND ACHIEVING GOALS THAT BUILD ONE UPON EACH OTHER IT'S IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY. OF DOING CASE WORK MATHEMATICA POLICY RESEARCH OUR PARTNERS DEVELOPED AN INCREDIBLE SUITE OF TOOLS TO HELP CASE WORKERS TO THEIR JOBS I SHOULD SAY MISS NIKOLAI WAS THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR WITH MATHEMATICA BEFORE SHE WAS STOLEN AWAY -- BY DSS -- A WIN WIN FOR ALL OF US I BELIEVE -- BUT THOSE THE SUITE OF TOOLS THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROJECT THAT THE COUNTIES OF ENGAGED INVOLUNTARILY AND IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE TAKE UP WE HAVE TO MAKE IT EASIER I THINK FOR WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE TOOLS. AND IDEALLY WE WOULD EMBED THOSE TOOLS INTO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE ALREADY USING SO THAT THAT DATA AND THE TOOLS CAN BE HELPFUL MOST HELPFUL FOR CASE MANAGEMENT. AND FOR RESEARCH AND SO THAT IS OUR PROPOSAL. COMES FROM THE PARSER SERVICES. JUST BRIEFLY NOTE THE SUPPORT OF SEATED MEDIA AND CONTINUING TO EXPLORE AND APPRECIATE THE COUNTIES EFFORTS AROUND TWO POINT NO KNOWING THAT IT'S NOT OUR INITIATIVE BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THEY LEARNED NOT AND SUPPORTING THEM AS WERE ABLE. TO OKAY GREAT HELLO [inaudible] FINANCE. CORRECT THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCHAS. THREE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT OKAY. LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER -- INVESTMENT AMBER THREE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR HOME VISITING INITIATIVE AND I THINK WITH ANGELA RATHER WELL HELLO WELCOME FROM THE CHILDREN NOW. GOOD AFTERNOON. HI MY NAME IS ANGELA RUFFLING HERE CONSIDER NOW AND I'M HERE TODAY TO RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR COMMITTEE TO BUILD UPON THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED INVESTMENT. IN THE CAL WORKS HOME VISITING INITIATIVE BY ALLOCATING AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO THE PROGRAM. AND CORPORATE IN KEY TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND VOLUNTARY EVIDENCE BASED ON VISITING FOR CAL WORKS FAMILIES. INCREASING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH POINTS EARLY CHILDHOOD IS A CRUCIAL PERIOD OF TIME. TO ESTABLISH CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION FOR LIFELONG HEALTH WELL BEING AND SUCCESS AND IT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS ARE WHAT FUELS EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF LIFE BABIES BRAINS ARE FORMING MORE THAN ONE MILLION NEURAL CONNECTIONS EVERY SECONDS. AND ALTHOUGH POVERTY AN UNMET NEEDS -- CAN WE CAN THIS ARCHITECTURE STABLE NURTURING RELATIONSHIPS AND PARENT CHILD INTERACTIONS BUT FOR THE IMPACTS OF ADVERSITY AND FOSTER RESILIENCY [inaudible] OUR IT'S A CRITICAL TIME TO SUPPORT FAMILIES WITH DUAL GENERATION PROGRAMS LIKE VOLUNTARY EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING -- WHICH CAN REINFORCE PARENTS OWN EFFORTS AND SKILLS AND ALSO HAVE DEMONSTRATED A SPECTRUM OF POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT CAN PROVIDE CHILDREN IN FAMILIES WITH CRITICAL LIFELONG PROTECTIVE FACTORS. WE APPLAUD THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP LAST YEAR. IN PUSHING THE ADMINISTRATOR PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION TO THINK BIG ABOUT HOME VISITING AND CAL WORKS HPI. AND WHILE IT'S AN UNPRECEDENTED EXPANSION OF HOME VISITING IN FORTY FOUR COUNTIES -- CURRENT FUNDING WILL ONLY GO FAR ENOUGH TO REACH AN ESTIMATED 80% OF THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION. SERVE THE COWARDS HOME VISITING INITIATIVE ENCOURAGES COUNTIES TO LEVERAGE EXISTING LOCAL. I. EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING PROGRAMS WILL ALSO EMPHASIZING ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THIS IS -- VERY SMART POLICY BUT KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS APPROACH WILL BE DATA. AND ALSO -- INSURING THAT -- THE COVERED CGI'S SITUATED SMARTLY IN THE LOCAL EARLY CHILDHOOD LANDSCAPE. BECAUSE THERE'S AN EXISTING DIVERSE ARRAY OF HOME VISITING ACROSS THE STATE AND THIS UNTIL LAST YEAR THIS ODD NETWORK WAS FULLY FUNDED BY FEDERAL AND LOCAL FUNDS. THERE'S A FOUNDATION TO BUILD UPON BUT THERE ARE ALSO MULTIPLE FUNDING STREAMS EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS AND VARIED DATA CONNECT COLLECTION MECHANISMS. HALF OF THE COUNTIES FUNDED IN THE H. B. I ALSO RECEIVE -- FEDERALLY FUNDED CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HOME VISITING SITES AND ALSO HAVE EARLY HEAD START -- HOME VISITING PROGRAMS IN FIRST FIVE FUNDED FOR HOME VISITING PROGRAMS IN ALMOST ALL OF THEM -- THESE ARE RELIABLE PARTNERS TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO SCALE UP THE PROGRAM BUT THEY NEED HELP -- WHEN LOCAL PROGRAMS AND PARTNERS COLLABORATING OR WELL CONNECTED THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER TO BETTER MAXIMIZE SCARCE RESOURCES? SO THESE EARLY YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION WE BELIEVE ARE CRITICAL TIME -- TO FOCUSED ON LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CAL WORKS FROM VISITING ISSUE AND BY DOING SO WE ACTUALLY COULD MAXIMIZE -- MANY MANY MULTI FACETED -- THERE'S OF SUPPORT AND ADDITIONAL NON TEN OF RESOURCES TO SUPPORT TWO GENERATIONS WITHIN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM -- EFFECTIVE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS OF COURSE MUST BE BACKED BY INFRASTRUCTURE SO THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE CAPACITY TO SERVE A GREATER NUMBER OF CAL WORKS FAMILIES. BUT ALSO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- AROUND THE WORK THEY NEED TO DO ON DATA AND COORDINATING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WE'RE ALSO REQUESTING KEY TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS WHICH WE'VE OUTLINED IN A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE AND I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THANK YOU THOMAS FROM THE PHARMACIST SERVICES. YES THANK YOU SO THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THAT THE PROPOSAL FROM THE ADVOCATES OF MERITS AND THAT FAMILIES WITH MORE THAN ONE CHILD CAN INDEED BENEFIT FROM HOME VISITING. I WOULD NOTE -- FOR YOU THE TWENTY SIX OF THE FORTY FOUR PARTICIPATING COUNTIES TO DATE I HAVE ALREADY PROPOSED EXPANDED POPULATION'S IT'LL BE SERVING OF THOSE TWENTY ONE PLAN TO SERVE -- PARENTS WITH MORE THAN ONE YOUNG CHILD FIVE PLAN TO EXPAND SERVICES TO CAL LEARN OF THE TEEN POPULATION AND ANOTHER FIVE HAVE PLANS TO EXPAND THE SERVICES. TO PARENTS WITH OLDER CHILDREN THOSE BETWEEN TWO AND FIVE BY A IN ADDITION I WOULD NOTE THAT WITH REGARD TO THE EXPANSION COUNTIES ALREADY EXPERIENCED SOME IMPLEMENTATION THOUGH IS RELATED TO LOCAL CONTRACTING PROCESSES BOARD OF SUPERVISOR APPROVALS HIRING TRAINING. AND DEVELOPING A USING DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS AND SO THE DEPARTMENT WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT IN MOVING FORWARD WE WILL BE PERFORMING TECH PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ETCETERA BUT THAT THAT CAPACITY P. IS REALLY WILL MATTER -- I ALSO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS TO EXPAND HOME VISITING PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY C. PH. BY ANOTHER TWENTY THREE MILLION -- AND LEAVE IT AT THAT. OKAY THANK YOU VALUE FINANCE OKAY. AT THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE THERE IS THAT THERE'S A YEP BECAUSE MULTIPLE PROPOSALS SO HOW DOES THIS FIT IN WITH ALL OF THOSE. I'LL. WE BELIEVE THE INVESTMENT OF THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD ACTUALLY HELP TO INTEGRATE -- AND COORDINATE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH FROM VISITING WITH THE ETI AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS THAT WOULD BE -- A KEY A KEY WAY THAT THE STATE COULD SET THINGS UP WELL NOW TO MAXIMIZE AND BE MORE EFFICIENT IN THE LONG TERM IT'S REALLY -- A CRITICAL TIME WHEN YOU'RE DOING AN EXPANSION THIS BIG T BE ATTENTIVE TO HOW WELL THE DEPARTMENTS WHICH ARE ALREADY DOING A GREAT JOB OF WORKING TOGETHER BUT HOW WE COULD BETTER RESOURCE THEM TO WORK TOGETHER IN SMARTER WAYS [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE SHOULD THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- NEXT ITEM IS ITEM NUMBER FOR RESTORATION OF THE SIXTY MONTH TIME CLOCK [inaudible] THANK YOU. GIVE US A HEADS WAS COMING IF WE DO AS AN AGENDA. YES -- MISTER CHAIR MY CAROL AGAIN WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE TO RESTORE THE TOWN OF SIXTY MONTH TIME CLOCK AND I DO THIS AND ON BEHALF OF BOTH WESTERN CENTER AND THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION TODAY -- AS YOU KNOW -- CENTER DR PAN IN -- TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE WE OOK MANY MANY DEVASTATING BUDGET CUTS AND TO THE THINGS THAT WE DID DURING THAT TIME ONE IS THAT WE REDUCE THE TIME ON AID. FROM THE FEDERAL MAXIMUM OF SIXTY MONTHS PUTTING US IN A MINORITY OF STATES IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING -- SEVERAL -- SOUTHERN STATES THAT CONTINUED AB SIXTY MONTH CLOCKS OUR STATE DOESN'T BIRD AND FORTY EIGHT MONTHS AND THEN THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE LEGISLATURE. AGAIN UNDER THE DRESS OF A VERY DIFFICULT BUDGET SITUATION -- WE MADE CHANGES TO WE SPLIT THOSE FORTY EIGHT MONTHS IN HALF TWENTY FOUR FOR FLEXIBLE A FLEXIBLE CLOCK TWENTY FOUR MONTHS FOR THE MORE DIFFICULT CAN OFF TO A WORK REQUIREMENTS. I I THINK -- IN NOT JUST OURSELVES BUT I THINK THE RAND CORPORATION HAS -- CONFIRM THAT THOSE CHANGES EXPRESSLY SPLITTING THE CLOCK AND HAVE -- HAD VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF FAMILIES TO GET OUT OF POVERTY -- NOW HAVING SAID THAT I MEAN WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT TO PRESERVING THE FLEXIBLE APPROACH WE THINK ABOUT APPROACH ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE IN LIGHT OF THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU JUST HAD. AROUND -- TOWN AFTER HOURS TWO POINT NO FEE THE NEW APPROACH THAT WERE USING THAT'S THE TO GENERATION APPROACH MOVING AWAY FROM THE OLD COMPLIANCE MODEL. SO THAT FLEXIBLE APPROACH WE BELIEVE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND SO IN GOING BACK TO THE SIXTY MONTH CLOCK WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO EXTEND OUT THAT FLEXIBLE PARTS OF THE ENTIRE SIXTY MONTHS. TO ALLOW TEN OF TWO POINT NO CALORIES TWO POINT NO TO BE ABLE TO APPLY ITSELF AS NEEDED -- THE OTHER THING THAT WE WOULD SAY ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE SIXTY MONTH CLOCK IS -- OUR FAMILIES ARE NOT ALL THE SAME AND THEY THEY THEY THEY SUCCEED IN THE PROGRAM AT DIFFERENT LEVELS AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS. M. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO KNOW WE HAVE A CASE LOAD NOW IS IT'S GOTTEN SMALLER AND SMALLER. THAT IS MORE COMPRISED OF FAMILIES WHO HAVE MORE BARRIERS TO OVERCOME I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR RECIPIENTS COME OFF AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'LL OFTEN HEAR THEM SAY AS THEY WERE LEAVING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. AT THE POINT THAT THEY ENTERED INTO THE CASELOAD -- PEOPLE OFTEN NEED MANY MONTHS TO TRY TO GET THROUGH A SITUATION LIKE THAT OUR CURRENT RULES STILL REQUIRE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE MOST THE TIME IN WELFARE TO WORK -- SO MONSTER TAKING OFF WHEN THEY REALLY CAN'T. ENGAGE IN THE WAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE AND YET WE STILL HAVE A FORTY EIGHT MONTH CLOCK THAT SORT OF PUTS THEM THERE. AND THEN THE OTHER THING WE WOULD SNOW TO IS THAT -- WE'VE WE FREQUENTLY SEE THAT SOMETIMES FAMILIES COME THROUGH THEY GET OFF OF THE THE FIND A JOB THEY'RE DOING WELL AND THEN PERHAPS THE ECONOMY FALLS OUT. AND THEN THEY HAVE TO COME BACK ON AID FOR A SECOND A SECOND SPELL SO HAVING THE FULL SIXTY MONTHS ALLOWS THOSE FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO GET RETRAIN AGAIN GET INTO AN OCCUPAION. THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO GET OUT OF POVERTY AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD URGE YOU -- TO SUPPORT THE EXTENSION BACK TO A SIXTY MONTH TIME CLOCK FOR CALYX. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PARSER SERVICES ALEJO FINANCE [inaudible] RIGHT. AMAZON OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL. DID A GOOD JOB. ALL RIGHT SO -- INTO THIS IS. NOW IS THERE A MINISTERS THAT ANYONE TELL. YOU TO HAVE A CAT. I MEAN THIS PROPOSALS COME UP MULTIPLE TIMES WE HAVE A GUEST MEDFORD ACOSTA THIS AND SEE THIS AND RIGHT. WE CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACT IN PROVIDE THAT CONSISTENT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE IT. OKAY NO WONDER. THE LAST WEEK RIPPLES WE CAN AB IN ADDITIONAL NEW INFORMATION BASED ON THE CASE LET'S MADE UP DATE THAT'S OKAY ALL RIGHT THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- MOVING ON TO CAL OR AND CAL WORKS TO PLANO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AGAIN -- ON THIS ISSUE WEHAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT CALOR AND CAL WORKS TWO POINT NO AND THE SINGLE ALLOCATION AND I MADE AN OR A PLEA EARLIER. TO KEEP OUR FOCUS ON SINGLE ALLOCATION. WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN THIS ARENA IS ARE TWO THINGS I THINK ONE IS? AS THE COUNTIES BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW TWO POINT OH APPROACH -- WE FEEL THERE'S A CONFLICT WITH THE EXISTING STATUTORY STRUCTURE WHICH CONTINUES TO PUSH TOWARDS -- WHAT WAS EARLIER DESCRIBED IN OUR TESTIMONY DAYS THE OLD WORK FIRST APPROACH A SO THE COUNTY AND THE WORK PARTICIPATION RATE ARE STILL OUT THERE? THAT THE COUNTY IS STILL REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE STATUTE -- THE COUNTY IN SOME DEGREE IS STILL BEING PUSHED -- TO TRY TO ME WORK PARTICIPATION RATES EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT REALLY A GOOD MEASURE WHAT WE WERE DOING AND IT. ALSO IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING IN CALOR. SO OUR RECOMMENDATION ON THIS I REQUEST OF THE COMMITTEE IS THAT -- THE LEGISLATURE CREATE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THAT WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATUTE AND COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT CHANGES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO BE MADE. TO THE CASE THE STATUTE IN ORDER TO FULLY EMBRACE THAT THE TOWN OF TWO POINT OH TWO POINT OH MODEL. AND WE WOULD ALSO GET LEASE RECOMMENDED YOU CONSIDER -- WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD WANT TO PUT SOME INTENT LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR THE KIND OF BIG KNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING. AND THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IT'S GOING TO COME BACK AND INFORM THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT POTENTIAL POLICY CHANGES THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED. SO THAT'S OUR REQUEST IN THIS MATTER. THANK YOU CON A COMPASS FROM DEPARTURE SERVICES. OHIO [inaudible] FINANCE. MEMBERS OKAY SO -- I GUESS IN TERMS OF WELL THIS TERMS OF RE LOOKING AT THEY OUT SOME REALLY APPROACH RIGHT THE EXISTING LANGUAGE RIGHT. IS THAT MEANS THAT. DOES THAT HAPPEN AS A ONE DONE THAT FOR RULE SOUNDS LIKE ENOUGH FOR A VERY LONG TIME I MEAN ARE WE ARE WE TRYING TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT PLACE THAN WE WERE BACK THEN RIGHT. WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT NO DOUBT YES WE LEARNED A LOT AT EIGHT IN THE KIND OF HISTORY OF OUR EXISTING PROGRAM I THINK PART OF WHAT AT MR HERALD JUST LAID OUT IN TERMS OF THE TWO POINT NO INITIATIVE AS WELL AS WHAT WE ARE PLANNING TO DO. WITH THIS NEW WORLD WAR WILL HAVE A LOT MORE INFORMATION AND DATA RIGHT TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT IS WORKING I THINK IT'S A IT'S WERE HAPPY TO EXPLORE AN ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS TO TO SEE WHAT ADDITIONAL. MODIFICATIONS TO BE MADE STATURE OKAY SO. SO I THINK. SO I THINK THAT -- HE COULD. TO FIGURE OUT PROCESS FOR THAT AND THEN OF COURSE. BUZZ A LEGISLATORS WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME ADVICE -- ABOUT -- IT BECAUSE OF A RE FRAMING OUR PROGRAM -- WE WE DON'T PEOPLE LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE F THE STATUTE AND SAY WELL. THAT'S AND IN CONFLICT ARE ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THE DIRECTION RIGHT SO. I WILL BE SURE CODE REFLECTS OUR INTENTIONS SO AND OBVIOUS IT'S OUR JOB HERE TO CHANGE THE CODE BUT WE NEED SOME ADVICE AND HELP ON THAT -- AND UP THAT IS THE WILL WILL HAVE OUR OWN OPINIONS ABOUT IT TOO BUT YEAH. YEAH I'LL JUST MENTION HAT THE THE CAL OR PROCESS IS ACTUALLY THAT'S EMBEDDED WITHIN IT SO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT. WE'RE LEARNING FROM THE COUNTIES PROGRESS IN EACH OF THE MEASURES WE WILL BE LOOKING HOLISTICALLY AS A STATE ON WHAT OTHER MODIFICATIONS IN THE MADE THE POLICY ALONG THE WAY THAT IS PART OF HOW THAT THAT THREE YEAR CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT CYCLES ENVISIONED SO. ABSOLUTELY ANTICIPATE NOT ONLY AND SHARING AND AND IDENTIFYING WHAT ADDITIONAL POLICY CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE A PROGRAM AT DESIGN COMPONENT SEEM TO BE MODIFIED BUT ALSO -- SETTING THRESHOLDS AND BENCHMARKS ON EXPECTATIONS OF SOME OF THOSE MEASURES ALONG THE WAY SO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS WERE ENVISIONED IN THE CAL OR STATUTE WILL BE PART OF OUR PROCESS BACK. ALSO JUST AGREE AND AGAIN A KNOWLEDGE IN IN TERMS OF MISTER HELD COMMENTS THAT WHAT CURRENTLY IS AND IS THIS EXISTING STATUE RELATED TO WPR THAT IS ALL BASED ON KIND OF THE HISTORICAL PROGRAM AS IT WAS DESIGNED TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND PERHAPS LA -- YOU MIGHT LOOK AT THAT. TOO WE WILL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH APARTMENT AND OTHERS AND YOU AND YOUR STAFF OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. TO HELP THINK ABOUT THIS PROCESS OKAY. I FIND MYSELF UP HERE OFTEN GOING BACK IN TIME GOING OKAY WELL CAN WE FIX SOMETHING THAT SEEMS WE JUST LIKE. IT'S THE SIXTH. WE'LL HAVE THAT SOMETIMES RATE SOME SOME OLD HABITS NEED TO BE CHANGED OKAY. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT ITEM NUMBER -- SIX HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND THE STRESS ON IN WELCOME BACK [inaudible] PLEASE [inaudible] OKAY. PLEASE BE IN. I ALWAYS BRING SOME PAPER WITH ME. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KEVIN AS THE NOW WITH CALLS FOR CALIFORNIA WELL FROM RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. IN THIS BUT THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND NOT ON THE HAND OUT. WHICH IS THE LIKE THE SCENES WERE FAMILIES ARE HOMELESS. THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA HAS TWO PIECES ONE IS TEMPORARY HOMELESS ASSISTANCE. SOMEONE OF FAMILIES HOMELESS TO GIVE ME A TEMPORARY HOME RENTS ASSISTANCE FOR SIXTEEN DAYS. AND THEN IF YOU FIND A PLACE. THAT WILL HELP YOU WITH THE LAST MONTH'S RENT PLUS A DEPOSIT. NOT TO EXCEED 80% OF YOUR THE PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICE BENEFITS. WHICH STUDENT NUMBER PROBLEMS SO WE HAVE A BUNCH OF RECOMMENDATIONS -- THE SIX RECOMMENDATIONS. ONE IS TO REPEAL THE SIXTEEN DAY. HOMELESS ASSISTANCE POLICY OF USE IT OR LOSE IT. WHICH KERN THE CURRENTLY IF YOU GET SIXTEEN DAYS YOU HAVE TO USE A WITHIN THOSE SIXTEEN DAYS. IF YOU TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS AND STAY WITH YOU AND AND THEN COME BACK. YOU LOSE THOSE TWO DAYS. SO THIS -- THIS PROPOSAL SAYS. YOU GET SIXTY DAYS AND YOU CAN USE IT WITHIN A MONTH OR TWO MONTHS OR WITHIN TWENTY DAYS. SHOULD BE NO DISINCENTIVE FOR BEING -- FOR BEING INNOVATIVE. THE NEXT ONE IS. TO ELIMINATE THE ONE YOU'RE. LIMITATION ON HOMELESS ASSISTANCE RIGHT DOWN TO GET HOMELESS ASSISTANCE OF FEBRUARY. AND THEN SOME IN JUNE THE LAND OR THE VICKS TO BECAUSE THEY FIND OUT THAT YOU'RE ON WELFARE. YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR NEXT SEPTEMBER SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE FAMILY OF TWO HAS TO BE IN THE STREETS. OF CALIFORNIA WAITING FOR SEPTEMBER TO COME THREE COULD APPLY FOR HOMELESS ASSISTANCE AGAIN. NOW SOME OF THESE POLICIES WERE DEVELOPED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHEN WAS DIFFERENT AND DESERVE THIS IS THE MOON WE TRY TO BRING IT INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ELIMINATE THE ONE YOU. LIMITATION AND GIVE YOU HOMELESS ASSISTANCE ANYTIME THAT YOU HOMELESS YOU SHOULD GET HOMELESS ASSISTANCE. THE CURRENTLY WITH THE TEMPERATE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE IS LIMITED TO HOTELS OR MOTELS. HOTELS AND MOTELS ONLY TAKE CREDIT CARDS. ENOUGH FOLKS DON'T HAVE CREDIT CARDS. SO AWFUL TO END UP IN THESE FREE BAG. CRIME INFESTED HOTELS OR MOTELS. IN THIS PROPOSAL BASS HE WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THAT MONEY. SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT THEY COULD USE THAT THE CONFINED BESIDES THE HOTEL MOTEL THAT WOULD GET HIM OUT OF THE STREET. AND INTO. A ROOF. THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS TO GET DATA. ON HOW MANY. PEOPLE ON CAL WORKS A HOMELESS RIGHT THOUGH WE HAVE NO IDEA. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? AND THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO LOOK AT THE TRY TO GET SOME DATA. SO WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT. THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS TO COUNTY OPTIONAL EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY HOMELESS ASSISTANCE. THEY GIVE YOU SIXTY DAYS HOMELESS ASSISTANCE. A PERMANENT HOMELESS. FOR EXAMPLE. IF YOUR TEMPER HOMELESS ASSISTANT ENDS ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF THE MONTH AND YOU GOT A PERMIT A PLACE TO LIVE ON THE FOUR ON THE FIRST. THEY SHOULD GIVE YOU FIVE MORE DAYS CITY COULD GET HOMELESS ASSISTANCE. AND THE FINAL PROPOSAL IS TO PUT A KALRA. FOR THE EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY THAT THEY GIVE YOU. AND I HAVE A CHART THAT SHOWS YOU. THAT THEY START OUT WITH THIRTY DOLLARS AFTER ELEVEN YEARS A ONE UP. TO FORTY THEY WE WAIT FOR THAT IS SEVEN YEARS TO GO UP TO SIXTY FIVE AND THEN WE WAITED FOR THAT A THIRTEEN YEAR IS. TO GO UP TO EIGHTY FIVE THE SUGGESTIONS TO HAVE A COLA. SORRY THERE IT TAKES SO LONG. THANK YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM SOCIAL SERVICES WE WE WE JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANT BENEFIT THAT IT THAT A SIXTEEN DAVE EMERGENCY SHELTER PLACE FOR FAMILIES BUT IT ALSO DOESN'T SOLVE THE FULL NEED WE ENCOURAGE AND FULLY SUPPORT COUNTIES THAT ARE BLENDING IN BRAIDING THEIR HOMELESS. ASSISTANCE RESOURCES WITH THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM AND AT THEIR HOUSING. I'M SUPPORT PROGRAMS OF LOCAL RESOURCES THAT I'VE BEEN FUSED TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS ASSISTANCE SO I ENCOURAGE CONTINUE DO THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN IMPROVE AT THE PROGRAM. OKAY THANK YOU -- COMMENTS FAMILIAL [inaudible] FINANCE. QUESTION FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS NOW ALL RIGHT -- OKAY WELL THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU. THIS MOVE ON OKAY WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER. SEVEN THANKS. EITHER SEVEN REPEAL COWARDS ACID TEST -- SEE WHO'S JUST FOR BUFFALO. WESTERN CENTER NOW JUST STILL HERE NOW [inaudible] OKAY. I SHOULD TRY JUST TO BRIEFLY POINT OUT THAT -- I ALSO SERVE ON HUMAN SERVICES AND HEARD PRESENTATION OF A BILL BY SIR WIENER ALONG THE SAME LINES I'VE SOME FAMILIAR IT ISSUED ON THE ONLY ONE LEFT IN THE DíAS WHOSE -- NOVEMBER SO REVENUE IN ORDER OF REVENUE MAY BE IN ORDER. OF MY APOLOGIES MY COLLEAGUE NOT BEING HERE I KNOW SHE'S BEEN IN OTHERS BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES TODAY -- SO VERY VERY BRIEFLY ON THIS MATTER -- OF CAL WORKS HAS MANY ELIGIBILITY RULES THAT WE HAD IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME HAVE AN INCOME RULE AND OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO HAVE. CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM AND ONE OF THE OF THE RULES THAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE LIMITS ON ASSETS FOR AUTOMOBILE IN CASH RESOURCES. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATE THOSE PROPOSALS ALLOW PERSONS WITH SMALL AMOUNTS OF ASSETS TO BE ABLE TO COME ON TO THE PROGRAM -- WE THINK THAT THE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE ARE BEING PUSHED OFF HIS RELATIVELY SMALL WE DON'T THINK THIS WOULD BE A LARGE FISCAL IMPACT IN THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR. AND WE WERE ORDERED SUPPORT OF ELIMINATION OF THOSE ASSETS RULES THANK YOU COMMENTS FROM SOCIAL SERVICES THIS VERY BRIEF YOU RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT WE DON'T HOLD A FORMAL POSITION ON THE PROPOSAL WE DO KNOW THE POTENTIAL. LIMITATION OF ASSET THRESHOLDS TO A POINT WOULD HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF AND WOULD BOTH BE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS AGAIN DECREASING THE BURDEN ON COUNTIES. THANK YOU OKAY [inaudible] HELLO. JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT POINT THIS APPEARS TO BE AN ISSUE OF SORT OF COMPARING THE COSTS AND BENEFITS -- WE THINK WE THERE MIGHT BE WAYS TO LOOK AT OR LEARN MORE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS FROM. ENFORCING THE OR OR REVIEWING -- ASSET TESTS ON AND THEN IN ADDITION TO COSTS AND BENEFITS HE THERE MIGHT BE OTHER POLICY QUESTIONS THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AND THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS. OKAY THANK YOU FINANCE. OKAY SO -- YEAH I'D HAVING HEARD THIS ISSUE PREVIOUSLY I THINK SOMEONE SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MINISTRY OF COST STRAIGHT IT'S A IT'S BOTH A MYSTERY BURDEN ON THE ELIGIBILITY COUNTY WORKERS AS WELL AS THE PERSON WHO'S APPLYING TO TRY TO DIG UP THE RECORDS I THINK THERE'S SOME ISSUES ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE. YOU HAVE A CAR AND DEPENDING ON HOW YOU ENDED UP THE THERE -- HAVING TO SELL A CAR OF CAR CARD IT'S OF OF OF A CERTAIN VALUE MINIMUM VALUE WHICH MIGHT NEED TO BY THE WAY WE WANT TO GO BACK TO WORK RIGHT -- AND WE DON'T HAVE -- YOU KNOW MASS TRANSIT EVERY SINGLE POINT IN. PLACE SO I MEAN I THINK -- THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN NINETY AT CERTAIN POINTS IF YOUR ASSETS WERE REALLY TRULY LARGE AND I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE WELL WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE INHERITED HER. SOMEONE'S HOUSE IT WAS WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS BOB LIGHTS. CETERA -- WELL WITH THE STATE DID KEEP UNTIL THE FIRST PROPERTY TAX BILL I'M SURE EVEN NOW SO -- EVEN WITH PROP THIRTEEN SO -- SO I MEAN IT IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME THAT WE USE V. THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDICK SAVINGS FOR THE MINISTRY BURDEN THAT THAT. AND IF YOU ACTUALLY HAD THAT MUCH CASH I MEAN IT. I GUESS YOU COULD STICK IN THE MATTRESS SOMEONE MAKE ANY MONEY BUT I UNDERSTAND AS SOON AS YOU START SPENDING DOWN ANY OF IT THAT STARTS COUNT THAT GETS COUNTED AS YOUR INCOME RIGHT SELF YOU GOT. AN INHERITANCE I'D SAY AND HE SAID WELL I'M GOING TO PULL OUT TEN THOUSAND OUT OF THAT RIGHT TO SPEND ON SOMETHING. THE MATTER WHAT NO MATTER HOW WORTHY THAT COUNTS AGAINST YOUR INCOME AND SO THEN THAT PUSHES YOU ARCHAEOLOGY BILLY ANYWAY. SO I I AM A WAITING TO FIND SOMEONE WHO HAS A BIG WAD OF MONEY WHO SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH I'M GONNA FIND A WAY TO JUST LIVE ON CAL WORKS NOT TOUCH THAT THING. AND GO THROUGH ALL THE INTRUSION THAT I MEAN LET'S BE BLUNT IT'S AN DON'T FLYING WE WE MAKE IT INTRUSIVE WE MAKE EVERYONE BEAR THEIR FINANCIAL SOUL RIGHT TO TO I WAS REALLY WORKER BEFORE WE LET THEM SIGN ON AT THAT SOMEONE'S REALLY YEAH I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME. FOR FRAUD OR CHEATING IS SO MINIMAL -- A CERTAINLY IS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL RECOGNIZE SOMEONE COULD TRY TO TURN A STORY YOU KNOW SOMEONE HAS YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A CADILLAC OR SOMETHING AT THAT THE OLD ONE BUT THEY HAVE ONE THEY GOT IT THEN THERE'S SOMEONE GAVE IT TO THEM. AND TA GETTING HOW WORKS AND HOW COULD YOU LET THEM DO THAT BUT I THINK REALISTICALLY WE NEED TO TALK REALITY. AND SO I HOPE I A ACTUALLY BY BECAUSE OF REALLY I MEAN I I THINK WE MIGHT EVEN SAVE MONEY DOING THIS. RIGHT CELL SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS I THINK YOU KNOW -- THE ACTUAL COST. SELL IT AT THE BE INTERESTING OF WHAT THE ACTUAL COST OR EVEN POTENTIAL SAVINGS WOULD BE ON THIS BUT I'M HOPING WE CAN. REALLY LOOK AT FIGURING THAT OUT BECAUSE MY GUESS IS THE GAS RIGHT NOW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RIGHT -- THAT IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE OF FOR THE THRIVE. FOR ALL THE HOUSEHOLD ELIMINATES FOR A DE MINIMUS BUT YOU'LL LET US KNOW NAY RIGHT. OKAY ALL RIGHT. THE OTHER COMMENTS ON THE OKAY. SIZE OF THE SITES WE WANT LESS REGULATION RIGHT OKAY. ALL RIGHT ITEM NUMBER EIGHT IS THE EMERGENCY CHILD CARE BRIDGE PROGRAM FOR FOSTER CHILDREN. HIS FOR SENDING THEIR KIMBERLY DEATH. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY OKAY SORRY. IF ALL RIGHT THE CHILD ACTION WELCOME. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE IN YOUR EMAIL [inaudible] THAT. EMINEM FOSTER RICH AN EMERGENCY FOSTER BRIDGE NAM AND PROGRAM. AND HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WE PARTNER SACRAMENTO COUNTY DC F. A. S.. IN IMPLEMENTING THE FOSTER CARE BRIDGE PROGRAM -- THIS PROPOSAL IS ASKING TO GROW THE EXISTING PROGRAM BY PROVIDING THIRTY EIGHT MILLION. TO EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL VOUCHERS FIVE MILLION TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL NAVIGATORS AND FOUR MILLION FOR ADDITIONAL TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING. AN CHILD ACTION HAS RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE BRIDGE PROGRAM REFERRAL SO FAR. WE'VE CURRENTLY -- HAVE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE CHILDREN. AND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE FAMILIES ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. EACH FAMILY IS SERVED BY A CHILD CARE NAVIGATOR. THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT EACH FAMILY RECEIVES VARIES GREATLY. BASED UPON THEIR NEED. AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY ONE OF OUR PRIORITY POPULATIONS IS EXPECTING IN PARENTING YOUTH. AND I CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THIS PROGRAM. WILL HELP COUNTIES SERVE MORE FOSTER CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. FOSTER CARE BRIDGE PROGRAM STAFF ALONG WITH PARTNERS WILL NOT HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO LIMIT THE NUMBER SERVE DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING. AND MANY OF OUR AB TWELVE CHILDREN ARE ENTERING INTO THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. PARENTING USER OFTEN HAS A TEN IT AKES ABOUT PHONE STRINGS BASED APPROACH TO ASSIST THEM. IT ALSO REQUIRES A DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCAL CHILD CARE CONTINUE IN. JUST A COUPLE OF ANTIDOTES HERE. AND ONE EIGHTY TELL PARENTS THAT I RECENTLY WORKED WITH NEEDED CHILD CARE SO SHE CAN RETURN TO SCHOOL AND WORK CHOOSE A BRIGHT YOUNG LADY SHE WAS ALREADY TAKING WANTED TO TAKE. TWO AND COLLEGE COURSES AS HERE COLLEGE. AND SHE BUT SHE WAS EXTREMELY HESITANT. ABOUT LEAVING HER ONE YEAR OLD IN CHILD CARE. A SHE NEEDED ENCOURAGEMENT EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY. HOW TO CHECK IN WITH HER REGULARLY AND EACH TIME HE DOES HIS MAKING STEPS? THE MOTHER IS BUT ONE OF DOZENS WE'VE WORKED WITH. AND ANOTHER FAMILY. AT FOUR SIBLINGS THEY WERE. AT RISK OF POSSIBLY BEING SPLINT AND THEIR GRANDPARENTS WANTED THEM -- IN THEIR CARE. AT BUT WITHOUT HEALTHCARE THE THE THE FEAR THAT THEY CUT IT. AND UPON WORKING WITH THEM THEY WERE JUST IN TEARS. THAT AND THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS A CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE. AND SO NOW THIS FOR CHILDREN'S ARE WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS. AND IN MOVING FORWARD WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER INCLUDING THIS BUDGET BUDGET ARGUMENTATION REQUEST AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. Q. ANY COMMENTS FROM OUR SOURCES REALLY THINK -- BUT CHILD ACTION AND OTHER PARTNERS WHO ARE PROVIDING THESE RESOURCES TO FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY BEEN AT A GREAT AT LAUNCH OF THIS EFFORT AND IS THE COMPANION TO ALL THE WORK WE'RE DOING OUR CONTINUING CARE REFORM TO REALLY. SUPPORT HAVE CHILDREN GETTING INTO UP PLACEMENTS IN HAVING THAT CHILD CARE AVAILABILITY IS A CRITICAL SUPPORT TO THAT SO -- I THINK THE ONLY THING WE WOULD ADD MENTION IS THAT IT THE BRIDGE IS STILL EARLY IN ITS AT PROGRAMS AT IMPLEMENTATION IF WE UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSAL PART OF IT IS LOOKING AT AT ELIMINATING ANY DURATION TO THE CHILD CARE AFTER COMPONENT SO WE'D SAY. WE'RE JUST AT THE POINT POINT OF LEARNINGWHETHER OR NOT THE BRIDGE ACTUALLY CONNECTS TO THAT LONGER TERM CHILDCARE SUBSIDY AND WANT THAT TO INFORM ANY DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE IN TERMS OF DURATION. AND DISPLAY NOTE THAT I GUESS WE SHOULD TRY HEARD THIS LAST WEEK OR HEARING THE OTHER FOSTER CARE PIECES BUT I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE PRESENT HERE TODAY. TELL YOU [inaudible] FINANCE OKAY. SO AGAIN NOT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PRESENTATION I THINK IN THE CONTEXT OF OF OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION LAST WEEK ABOUT FOSTER CARE AND BEING SURE THAT -- THAT WE HAVE THE AVAILABILITY OF CHILD CARE FOR THESE FAMILIES EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. SO NOW WILL IT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON AND WE HAVE EIGHT PROPOSALS INVESTMENT SO YOU CAN TELL ME WHICH ONES ARE YOUR FAVORITE ONES -- OR YOU CAN SAY YOU SUPPORT ALL LATER SOMETHING IN BETWEEN SO WELCOME THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SYLVIA VALENCIA WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE COUCH POLICY SECTION. AND WE ARE ACTUALLY CO SPONSOR OF THE PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARDS. AND SO AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER -- THE FAMILIES AND CAL WORKS ARE BEING ABRUPTLY DISCONTINUED FROM THE PROGRAM AND THIS IS MORE SO HAPPENING OF IN LA AT IN IN -- AT A FASTER RATE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE THE LOS ANGELES WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE MINIMUM WAGE -- INCREASES A LOT FASTER THAN THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE BEGAN OUR LAST YEAR AS OF LAST YEAR -- JULY AT OUR MINIMUM WAGE IS THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE IT'S GOING TO BE -- INCREASE TO FOURTEEN TWENTY FIVE THIS YEAR IN JULY AND NEXT YEAR IT'LL BE IT'LL GO UP TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS. SO BASED ON THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT AT SOME OF THE DATA AND WE'RE ANTICIPATING THERE APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FAMILIES ARE GOING TO BE DISCONTINUED DURING THIS PERIOD. ARE WE ALSO NOTICED THAT WE'RE DENYING FAMILIES THAT TWICE THE RATE THAN WE USED TO OVER THE LAST DECADE WE WERE DENYING FAMILIES DUE TO INCOME AT 18%. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WE'RE NOW IT'S NOW AT 31%. SO YOU KNOW FAMILIES ARE BEING FORCED TO REDUCE OUR WORK HOURS AND IN ORDER TO CONTINUE RECEIVING AID ON THE PROGRAM. HOWEVER THIS PUTS THEM IN A SITUATION OF NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD RENT IN LA WHICH IS AT A VERY HIGH COST. UNFORTUNATELY MANY FAMILIES LOSE OUR HOUSING AND BECOME HOMELESS AND TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF THE DATA THAT WAS REQUESTED OUR YEAR WE HAVE OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMELESS FAMILIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THESE ARE FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. IN ADDITION IF THEY CHOOSE TO KEEP EMPLOYMENT AND INCREASE THEIR INCOME SO THAT THEY CAN AFFORD HOUSING NOW TO USE OUR CARROTS AND RAMPARTS OKAY SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. TRY TO ASK PEOPLE TO KEEP FOR THE MINUTE WE PEOPLE CAN SUBMIT THINGS IN WRITING AND SO FORTH BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU WELCOME.
