REMOVING INTO THIS AT THE STATE

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.170
LEVEL.

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:28.971
THE ANALYSIS THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:29.905
TO FIND IS THAT.

01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:30.973
THE RATE OF FRAUD IN

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.075
CALIFORNIA'S 19% FOR THE EARNED

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.477
INCOME TAX CREDIT.

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:35.578
BUT THAT'S BETTER THAN THE

01:08:35.644 --> 01:08:37.546
FEDERAL LEVEL APPARENTLY IT'S UP

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:38.547
240%.

01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:40.216
SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THE

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:41.717
INITIATIVE IS BY BY THE

THAT.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.758
WERE REDUCING THE LEVEL OF FRAUD.

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:50.893
I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.094
COLLEAGUE J. CHAMBERLAIN IN OUR

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:57.132

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:08.444
GIVEN -- FRIDGES SEX WORD WRAP A

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:11.380
RESOURCES. TO TO VERIFY -- THAT

EARNED OF THE THE INCOME AND TO

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:19.655
MAKE SURE THERE ARE.

01:09:19.722 --> 01:09:22.291
THAT THERE ISN'T -- ARE AS MUCH

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:23.359
AS POSSIBLE THAT IT ISN'T YOUR

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:25.494
HAVING FRAUDULENT RETURNS WHERE

01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:26.662
SOMEONE TAKE SOMEONE ELSE SO

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.464
SECURITY NUMBER FILE SO.

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:29.231
OTHERS BEEN QUITE A BIT OF OF

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:33.002
WORK AND AND RESOURCES PUT INTO --

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:34.470
PREVENT IT HAPPENING FRAUD AND

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:35.638
AND WHICH CALL FRONT THERE'S

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:38.007
THERE'S ALSO -- THERE ARE PEOPLE.

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:42.645
WHO DO CLAIM -- THE CREDIT.

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:44.313
THINKING THAT THE ARE YOU FOR

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.782
INSTANCE THAT THEY THAT A CHILD.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.684
IS A DEPENDENT.

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:51.453
BUT MEDIA JOINT CUSTODY CASE THE

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:51.954
CHILD MAY BE MAY BE THE

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:52.521
DEPENDENT.

01:09:52.588 --> 01:09:54.056
TECHNICALLY OF THE OTHER PARENT

01:09:54.123 --> 01:09:56.125
AND SO THERE ARE MANY CASES

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.961
WHERE -- AFTER WE WILL DENY A

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:02.398
CREDIT BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY THEY

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:03.599
DETECT SOMETHING ON THEIR TURN

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:04.466
THIS SHOWS THAT THAT.

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:06.468
INDIVIDUALS NOT ENTITLED TO THE

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:08.537
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT BUT I

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:09.471
DON'T CONSIDER THAT FRAUD IN THE

01:10:09.538 --> 01:10:10.773
SENSE THAT THERE THERE'S MONEY

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:13.309
GOING OUT -- THAT THAT ISN'T

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.077
DESERVED UNDER THE CREDIT OR OR

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.645
COULD JUST SURFACE WHEN WHEN IT

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:18.347
RETURNS ARE FILED ELECTRONICALLY

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:19.982
WHICH IS SHOW UP THAT DAY YOU

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:20.916
CAN'T EVEN DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:24.687
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T PRESS THE

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:26.555
DEPENDENT.

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:27.790
YOU KNOW SQUARE RIGHT SO TRY

01:10:27.856 --> 01:10:28.791
BOUNCING OUT AUTOMATICALLY BUT I

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:29.458
JUST WONDER IF.

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:30.459
IF THAT THE LEVELS ARE THAT HIDE

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:31.827
IT THAT THEY'RE SAYING IT'S 40%

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:35.064
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:37.266
AND YET IT'S A LOAN.

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:38.901
NATIONWIDE IS IS I UNDERSTAND.

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:40.536
IT SO BUT BUT THAT'S THAT THAT

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:42.237
MEANS THERE'S COMMITTEE AT AN

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:43.472
ADDED EFFORT TO LOOK AT THOSE.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:44.073
CREDIT SO WHICH MEANS THAT MAY

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:45.874
BE.

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:46.942
A LOT OF OUR LOW INCOME PEOPLE

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:48.911
ARE GOING TO BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.512
TO A TAX AUDIT I'M JUST KIND OF

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.648
WONDERING.

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:53.248
IF THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE A LOT

01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:56.118
OF PEOPLETHAT SHOULD BE TAKING

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:58.520
THE CREDIT FROM DOING SO IF THAT.

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:01.357
IS HAPPENING.

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:03.459
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE -- A

01:11:03.525 --> 01:11:05.995
FULL TAX AUDIT IT WOULD BE MORE --

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:08.230
AN ANALYSIS OF THE TAX RETURN TO

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:09.398
SEE IF.

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:11.567
IF THEY HAVE ALL ALL THE

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:13.502
CRITERIA AND THE THEY CAN YOU

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:14.036
KNOW.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.038
IF THEY'VE GOT A AS A A

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.339
QUALIFIED DEPENDENT QUALIFY

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:19.074
INDEPENDENT OR MAYBE THEY'RE

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:20.576
PREPARING IT MANUALLY THEN AND

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:21.877
THE RATS WITH A TRIBUTE BECAUSE

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:22.778
IF THERE WERE ELECTRONIC IT

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:26.315
PROBABLY WOULD SELF CORRECT I

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.771
CALIFORNIA WEREN'T.

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:31.540
FINALIZING TO TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:33.008
EVEN THE LAW WAS PASSED PRIOR TO

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:34.509
THAT SO WE DO HAVE TO ADJUST TO

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:35.544
THAT FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS.

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:36.812
IT AND HOW DO YOU FEEL YOUR

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:39.481
STAND NOW AND AS FAR AS THIS

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:40.449
BUDGET IS TO STERN.

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:43.485
CONCERN PROCEEDING WITH.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:44.619
THE COMPLETION THE REAL ID

01:18:44.686 --> 01:18:46.054
THAT'S A LONG AND COMPLICATED.

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:47.656
AND BECOME MORE COMPLICATED

01:18:47.722 --> 01:18:48.490
ACTUALLY.

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.592
SO WE RECOGNIZE THE

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:51.793
ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.261
THERE WERE CHALLENGES WITH REAL

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:54.696
ID AND THEN THERE ARE CHALLENGES

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:57.132
AT THE DMV MORE BROADLY THAT ARE

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:59.067
AGGRAVATED BY THE FACT THAT WE

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:00.368
HAVE THIS IMPENDING DEADLINE.

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:02.504
NEXT YEAR SO THE CHANGES THAT WE

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:04.206
ARE SUGGESTING ARE PROPOSING FOR

01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:05.407
THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT ARE

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:06.808
BASICALLY TO PUT A LOT OF

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:08.243
RESOURCES INTO THE NEXT TWO

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.977
YEARS.

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:10.512
A LOT OF IT DRIVEN BY REAL ID

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:11.947
BUT NOT ALL OF THAT BECAUSE WE

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:14.082
KNOW EVEN WHEN RELY DE EVEN WHEN

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:15.317
WE GET THROUGH IF AND WHEN WE

01:19:15.383 --> 01:19:16.518
GET TO THAT DEADLINES WE STILL

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:17.652
HAVE TO MAKE SURE TO REDUCE WAIT

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:18.820
TIMES WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:19.621
THAT WHEN.

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:20.388
PEOPLE COME TO THESE FIELD

01:19:20.455 --> 01:19:22.290
OFFICES THEY KNOW WHAT DOCUMENTS

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:23.692
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BRING IN

01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:24.793
THEIR NOT SENT HOME AND CAN NEED

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:25.894
TO COME BACK AGAIN.

01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:26.995
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:28.663
CAN SWIPE THEIR CREDIT CARD AT A

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:30.365
FIELD OFFICE SO ALL OF THESE TO

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.033
REQUIRE SOME UP FRONT INVESTMENT

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.635
AT THE VERY SAME TIME THAT WE

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:36.671
ARE DEALING WITH THE IMPENDING

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:38.106
REAL ID DEADLINE.

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.441
I'LL JUST BE LABOR THIS IS

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:40.709
SECOND IS KIND OF A IN A RATING

01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:42.377
A COMPLAINT FROM THE FIELD.

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:45.113
THAT IN THE OFFICES ONE THERE IS

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.415
A BREAK TIME.

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:48.984
A GIVEN WINDOW.

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:50.118
WE'LL BE JUST VACATED.

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:51.853
DURING THAT BREAK THERE'S NO ONE

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.955
TO BACK FILL IT IS AT GENERAL

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:56.291
STAFFING POLICY IT BMB.

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:58.126
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SPECIFIC

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:01.796
pPART OF THESE CHANGES WE ARE

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:03.532
INVESTING A LOT IN TRAINING AND

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:04.666
MAKING SURE AND NOT JUST

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:05.934
MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC OFFICES

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:07.269
BUT REGIONAL MANAGEMENT AND

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:08.837
OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE.

01:20:08.904 --> 01:20:10.472
THAT PEOPLE HAVE A BETTER

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:13.241
EXPERIENCE THERE.

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:16.845
I UNDERSTAND THAT'S DESIRED.

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:17.879
THIRTY WILL.

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:21.850
FALL BY FILLMORE Là.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:23.084
JUST TO LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:26.154
THAT -- THE TRANSPORTATION --

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:28.823
COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE AS HARD

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.592
INTENTIONAL STAFF TO WORK JUST

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.194
SPECIFICALLY ON THE DMV.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.362
SO WILL BE DEDICATING A LOT OF

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:37.132
ENERGY -- REVIEWING AND WE'RE

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:39.434
SUPPORTER OF THE DMV.

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.603
BUT THE DMV CLEARLY NEEDS TO

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:45.207
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO MEET TO

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:46.942
THE REAL ID WORKLOAD -- WE NEED

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:48.443
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.278
UNDERSTAND HOW THESE RESOURCES

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:51.813
WILL BE ADEQUATELY.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.182
ADDRESSING THE NEEDS AND HAVE

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:55.951
THE STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY

01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:56.751
MEASURES TO TRACK.

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:58.353
DMV PROGRESS IN MEETING THE

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.222
CHALLENGE SO STRONG

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:02.157
ACCOUNTABILITY BE CRITICAL.

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:05.060
AND AFFECTED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:06.494
THE D. V. D. M. V. IN THE

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:08.463
LEGISLATURE. TO THAT END THE

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.131
PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE AND IMPROVE

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:11.833
IMPLEMENTING REPORTING

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.869
REQUIREMENTS ON WAIT TIME HIRING

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:18.506
TECHNOLOGY -- PROPOSALS AS WELL

01:21:18.573 --> 01:21:19.641
AS THE DMV'S RESPONSE.

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.509
THE RESPONSE TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:22.510
OF FINANCE AUDIT.

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:23.578
AND THE STRIKE TEAMS

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:25.480
RECOMMENDATION WILL BE CRITICAL

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:27.782
WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE --

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:33.021
CONCERT REVIEW OF THE DMV -- AND

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:34.556
IT IT'S CONCERNING ME THAT THE

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:41.062
OCTOBER -- TWENTY TWENTY DATE --

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:43.298
FOR REAL ID -- WILL REQUIRE A

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:45.233
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.636
MONTHLY -- NUMBER OF

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.838
APPLICATIONS THAT THEY WILL NEED

01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:51.706
TO BE TAKEN PLACE.

01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:55.410
AND THE THE BASIC QUESTION IS --

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:56.711
THIS BUDGET PLAN IS BEING

01:21:56.778 --> 01:22:01.216
SUBMITTED -- WILL IT -- HAVE THE

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:10.625
NECESSARY -- ADDITIONAL STAFF

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:11.593
AND EFFORT -- WITH THE

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.561
TECHNOLOGY TO MEET THE TWENTY

01:22:13.628 --> 01:22:14.195
TWENTY DEADLINE FOR REAL ID FOR

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:15.697
THE TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.899
NEED TO RECEIVE THE GRILL ID --

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:21.569
BY OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY IS IS

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:23.171
THAT A YES OR IS THAT A NO.

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:24.306
I'LL JUST SAY BRIEFLY THAT WE

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:25.874
RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES AND THE

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.276
FACT THAT BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:29.577
TWENTY IT'S A LITTLE OVER A YEAR

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:30.612
AND CLOSE TO YOUR NAPA WE'VE GOT

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.147
TWO SUMMERS AND SUMMERS

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:33.648
TYPICALLY WHEN THE DMV FACES.

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:35.550
THE MOST DEMAND BUT WHAT WE DO

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.686
HAVE IN OUR PROPOSAL IS NEARLY

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:38.887
TWO THOUSAND ADDITIONAL

01:22:38.953 --> 01:22:41.089
TEMPORARY POSITIONS SPECIFICALLY

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:42.490
TEMPORARY BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:43.925
DESIGNED TO MEET THIS NEED SO WE

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:45.260
THINK IT'LL MAKE A BIG

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:46.728
DIFFERENCE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.163
SIMPLE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:50.265
PROPOSAL'S WELL DESIGNED TO MEET.

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.566
THAT NEED WILL ARE YOU MEET THE

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:55.637
DEADLINE OF THE TWENTY MILLION.

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:56.604
APPLICATIONS BY.

01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:59.541
OCTOBER.

01:22:59.607 --> 01:23:00.875
TWENTY TWENTY IS THIS PLAN IS A

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:02.844
PLAN YOU HAVE.

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:04.846
WILL ACCOMPLISH THAT THAT'S THE

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:06.514
KEY QUESTIONS.

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:07.182
THE PLAN WILL ACCOMPLISH IT OVER

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:08.350
MULTIPLE YEARS INCLUDING AFTER

01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:09.651
THE TWENTY TWENTY DEBT FIE.

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:10.952
BECAUSE THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:12.587
WHO IF YOU HAVE A PASSPORT YOU

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:13.922
DON'T NEED A REAL ID TO FLY YOU

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:15.290
BRING YOUR PASSPORT WITH YOU --

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:16.991
AND SO IT IS.

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:18.626
NOT REQUIRED IN CALIFORNIA

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:20.362
THAT'S EVERYONE GET A REAL ID IT

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:22.764
IS OPTIONAL BUT WE BELIEVE THAT --

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:26.434
WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES --

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:27.602
FOR TO TO ADDRESS THOSE COMING

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:31.439
IN AND PART OF YOUR BILL

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:32.407
LANGUAGE MINING WILL.

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:35.143
BOTH LEGISLATIVE MINISTRATION

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:36.811
CONTINUE TO MONITOR.

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:37.712
SO THEN THE QUESTION WOULD BE IF

01:23:37.779 --> 01:23:39.047
YOU CAN'T DO THE TWENTY TWENTY

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:41.483

ONE THE PROXIMATE QUARTER OF

THAT WOULD BE IN THE FIRST.

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:08.410
QUARTER SO.

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:10.645
TOP THIRTEEN MILLION.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:15.417
OKAY SO -- SO THE QUESTION IS IN

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:17.819
THE OUT YEARS -- THE REAL ID

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:20.255

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:26.060
AND WITH WE NEED IT WOULD BE

01:24:26.127 --> 01:24:27.996
HELPFUL IN MONITORING THIS.

01:24:28.062 --> 01:24:29.597
HOW MUCH CHAU?

01:24:29.664 --> 01:24:32.066
HOW LONG THAT ADDED REVENUE WILL

01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:33.301
BE NEEDED?

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:36.504
AND WHEN WILL THAT -- THAT OUT

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:39.407

INCREASED COSTS FOR THE DMV.

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:15.510
THAT THAT A PART OF THAT IS DUE

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:17.846
TO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE GOING

01:25:17.912 --> 01:25:20.148
TO WAIVE THE MERCHANT FEAR THE

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:22.250

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:53.367
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:54.802

ANNUAL -- INDEPENDENT ON IT AND

01:32:56.771 --> 01:33:00.041
THEN LASTLY CMS HHS AND I IN THE

01:33:00.107 --> 01:33:01.442
IRS ALL HAD TO PROMULGATE

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:02.877

CMS AND HHS HAVE TO CERTIFY THAT --

01:33:08.683 --> 01:33:10.084
HEALTHCARE SCHERING MINISTRIES

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:12.420

ON THEIR WEBSITE.

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:23.798

DISCUSSION ABOUT THE THIS ISSUE

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:20.855
I THINK THE THE THERE IS

01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:22.923
SIGNIFICANT CONCERN -- THAT --

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:24.859
DESPITE THE SECTIONS THAT

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:26.560
BASICALLY FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN

01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:29.063
CALIFORNIA -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:31.165
STANDARDS THAT WE SET AN ANSWER

01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:32.666
FORCED BY THE FARM AND HEALTH

01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:36.337
CARE BECAUSE WHEN WE SAY THAT

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:37.238
PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY.

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:38.539
PREMIUMS THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:40.875
THAT THE PLANS ARE THERE WHEN --

01:34:40.941 --> 01:34:42.376
WHEN THEY NEED THEM RIGHT SO YOU

01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:45.279
ARE PAYING INTO A?

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:46.347
POOL ARE YOU PAYING IT FOR

01:34:46.414 --> 01:34:49.884
INSURANCE YOU ON BE SURE THAT

01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:52.086
SERVICES THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:52.820
TO AND AND HONORED THE

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:54.321
ESSENTIALLY THE CONTRACT NOW THE

01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:54.889
CHALLENGE WITH HEALTH CARE

01:34:54.955 --> 01:34:57.691
MINISTRIES.

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:59.160
CERTAINLY THEY ARE NOT INSURANCE.

01:34:59.226 --> 01:34:59.860
BUT THEY ARE IS A CLICK

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:02.763
MEMBERSHIP FEES AND THEN THEY

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:04.432
AND DATE PAY FOR SOME THE

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:06.167
HEALTHCARE COSTS BUT THERE'S NO

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:08.035
GUARANTEE THAT THE MEDICAL.

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:09.670
BILLS WILL BE SHARED ARE PAID

01:35:09.737 --> 01:35:11.439
AND SO THE CHALLENGE HERE IS IS

01:35:11.505 --> 01:35:15.876
THAT -- THAT IN THAT -- HEALTH

01:35:15.943 --> 01:35:17.244
CARE MINISTRIES UNFORTUNATELY

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:19.313
THEY DON'T HAVE TO MEET -- THE

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.715
SAME KIND OF STANDARDS OR EVEN

01:35:21.782 --> 01:35:23.417
CLOSE IN TERMS OF ENSURING

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:25.252
DEFICIT FISCAL VIABILITY AND

01:35:25.319 --> 01:35:27.388
DISABILITY AND THERE'S A BIG

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:29.090
CONCERN IS IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS

01:35:29.156 --> 01:35:30.791
IS THAT BY THE WAY WHENEVER YOU

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:32.293
HAVE AN ENTITY THAT SUPPOSED TO

01:35:32.359 --> 01:35:34.128
PROVIDE HEALTH CARE -- COVERAGE

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:35.296
WHEN SOMEONE PAYS INTO IT

01:35:35.362 --> 01:35:37.832
WHATEVER IT IS -- THAT IF WHEN

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:39.166
THEY COLLAPSE OR THEIR NINETY

01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:40.734
WILL MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS THAT

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:42.770
EXPENSE ENDS UP BEING PASSED ON

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:44.038
TO ALL THE REST OF US BECAUSE

01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:45.806
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT.

01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:46.941
THAT ENTITY WHETHER IT'S

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:47.508
INSURANCE COMPANY OR HAVE

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:49.076
CHEMISTRY THEY CAN'T PAY OUT

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:50.511
WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PAY OUT.

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:52.046
THEN WHAT HAPPENS OF COURSE THE

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:53.380
PERSON DOESN'T HAVE THE COVERAGE

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:54.582
THE FULL STILL BE SICK THEY'LL

01:35:54.648 --> 01:35:58.552
SHOW UP IN THE HEALTH CARE

01:35:58.619 --> 01:35:59.987
FACILITY.

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:01.122
NO GO BANKRUPT BUT THEN THE THE

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:01.856
THE EXPENSE GETS SPREAD OUT

01:36:01.922 --> 01:36:02.656
AMONGST EVERYONE ELSE SO I THINK

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:03.591
IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:05.359
BEHIND -- WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

01:36:05.426 --> 01:36:06.060
WE'RE SAYING THAT PEOPLE NEED TO

01:36:06.127 --> 01:36:08.229
HAVE -- COVERAGE THAT IS THERE

01:36:08.295 --> 01:36:10.431
AND AVAILABLE FOR THEM AND SO

01:36:10.498 --> 01:36:11.165
AND FORTY BECAUSE HEALTH CARE%

01:36:11.232 --> 01:36:12.733
MINISTRIES DO NOT FIT IN THE

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:13.767
CONTEXT.

01:36:13.834 --> 01:36:15.436
OF ANY SORT OF FEEL THEY'RE NOT

01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:16.837
REGULATED -- THE THEY'RE NOT

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:18.472
THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT UNLIKE WHAT

01:36:18.539 --> 01:36:20.941
WE REQUIRE FOR HEALTH PLANS AND

01:36:21.008 --> 01:36:21.609
THEY OFTEN COMPLAIN ABOUT IT TO

01:36:21.675 --> 01:36:23.644
US HERE IN THIS VERY ROOM BUT

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:26.380
THEY THEY HAVE TO MEET -- VERY

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:28.249
YES THEY HAVE TO MEET -- FISCAL

01:36:28.315 --> 01:36:29.650
RESERVE REQUIREMENTS OTHER TYPES

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:31.152
OF THINGS ASSURE THAT THEY ARE

01:36:31.218 --> 01:36:33.787
PRESENT AND SO AT WE DO NOT FEEL

01:36:33.854 --> 01:36:34.622
THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO

01:36:34.688 --> 01:36:36.223
INCUDE ENTITIES THAT DID NOT

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:39.660
HAVE THOSE -- THOSE PROTECTIONS --

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:42.363
TO TO COUNT -- AS AS HEALTHCARE

01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:44.598
COVERAGE.

01:36:44.665 --> 01:36:45.866
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR

01:36:45.933 --> 01:36:47.468
PANTHER MORLOCK.

01:36:47.535 --> 01:36:48.569
SO I'M JUST CREATIONS WE TALKED

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:51.138
ABOUT STATISTICS EARLIER TODAY --

01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:53.541
TOO WE HAVE ANY.

01:36:53.607 --> 01:36:54.942
ORGANIZATION OF THIS NATURE

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:56.510
THAT'S ACTUALLY.

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:58.546
DEFAULTED RUBIO TWENTY YEARS OF

01:36:58.612 --> 01:37:00.648
HISTORY I'M JUST IF WE HAVE A

01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:02.516
BUSINESS MODEL THAT HASN'T HAD A

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:03.851
THE PROBLEM I'M I'M WONDERING

01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:04.652
WHY.

01:37:04.718 --> 01:37:08.289
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD SPUR.

01:37:08.355 --> 01:37:09.557
SOMETHING DISTRICT ADDICTS.

01:37:09.623 --> 01:37:11.091
WELL I WOULD SAY FIRST OF ALL --

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:12.660
IT MAINLY WE DON'T HAVE -- THAT

01:37:12.726 --> 01:37:13.661
WHILE THERE ARE SO I THINK

01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:16.063
THERE'S ONE COMPANY THAT MARKETS

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:17.665
THE CALIFORNIANS WITH --

01:37:17.731 --> 01:37:19.233
CALIFORNIA HASN'T HAD -- THAT

01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:20.901
MANY HEALTH CARE MINISTRIES IN

01:37:20.968 --> 01:37:23.337
OUR STATE -- THEY ARE MORE

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:24.605
EXISTENCE AND OTHER PLACES BUT

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:26.941
THERE AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE

01:37:27.007 --> 01:37:28.309
NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME.

01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:29.610
BUT I THINK IT WAS CERTAINLY

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:30.945
HEARD STORIES WHERE AGAIN SO

01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:32.313
FORGET THIS IS NOT INSURANCE SO

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:33.981
WHAT HAPPENS THEY DON'T PROMISE

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:35.716
THAT -- THE MEDICAL BILLS CAN BE

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:38.986
PAID SO NOT TRULY COOPERATED IS

01:37:39.053 --> 01:37:41.288
I'M SURE THEY WERE RE INSURANCE

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:42.523
TO COVER YEAH SO RIGHT SO HE TO

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:43.090
TO THE CHALLENGES OF WHAT

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:44.592
HAPPENS IS THAT IF THEY SAY WELL

01:37:44.658 --> 01:37:45.626
YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN'T COVER

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:47.461
THAT ARE WE WON'T BE ABLE TO

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:47.695
COVER.

01:37:47.761 --> 01:37:50.197
THAT THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

01:37:50.264 --> 01:37:52.132
PERSON WHO NEEDS CARE SPECIALLY

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:53.567
FAIRLY EXPENSIVE CARE INSURANCE

01:37:53.634 --> 01:37:55.202
COMPANIES DO THAT TO YOU TOO

01:37:55.269 --> 01:37:56.036
WELL ACTUALLY THE INSURANCE

01:37:56.103 --> 01:37:57.605
COMPANIES ARE REGULATED BY THE

01:37:57.671 --> 01:37:59.373
FINANCIAL HEALTH CARE SO THEY

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:02.042
CAN ONLY DENY CERTAIN THINGS AND

01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:03.911
IN FACT IF THEY DENY YOU -- AND

01:38:03.978 --> 01:38:05.112
YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL TO

01:38:05.179 --> 01:38:07.314
TEAMMATES SEE -- TO SAY LOOK YOU

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:08.549
KNOW ACTUALLY THIS IS MEDICALLY

01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:09.717
NECESSARY I NEED TO HAVE THIS

01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:11.051
COVERAGE SO WE HAVE MECHANISMS

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:13.020
IN PLACE TO PROTECT PEOPLEWHEN

01:38:13.087 --> 01:38:14.188
THEY BUY HEALTH INSURANCE.

01:38:14.255 --> 01:38:15.456
I'M NOT SAYING TO ALWAYS PERFECT

01:38:15.522 --> 01:38:17.057
BUT WE HAVE THOSE MECHANISMS AND

01:38:17.124 --> 01:38:19.093
THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY FILE --

01:38:19.159 --> 01:38:20.728
WITH THAT WITH THE REGULATOR

01:38:20.794 --> 01:38:22.062
PROOF OF THAT THEY HAVE AN

01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:23.297
ADEQUATE NETWORK THAT THEY

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:24.265
ACTUALLY HAVE THE FINANCIAL

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:26.166
RESERVES AND SO FORTH -- THESE

01:38:26.233 --> 01:38:28.068
MINISTRIES DO NOT AND SO WE

01:38:28.135 --> 01:38:30.337
DON'T WE WE DO NOT -- NO OTHER

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:32.640
DAY ACTUALLY HAVE THE CAPACITY

01:38:32.706 --> 01:38:33.307
TO PROVIDE THE CARE AND THEY MAY

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:34.875
BE HOPING THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T

01:38:34.942 --> 01:38:35.909
GET REALLY SICK.

01:38:35.976 --> 01:38:37.344
SO THEN ONCE YOU HAVE A FIVE

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:38.679
YEAR PHASE IN TO SAVE YOUR YOU

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:39.880
GOT A STARTED ACTING TO A

01:38:39.947 --> 01:38:48.022
REGULATORY MODEL AS OPPOSED TO

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:48.756
JUST CUT THEM OFF.

01:38:48.822 --> 01:38:50.758
WELL CERTAINLY THEY HAVE NOT HAD

01:38:50.824 --> 01:38:51.892
A CONVERSATION WITH US ABOUT

01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:52.893
SAYING THAT THEY SEEK OVERSIGHT

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:54.495
AND REGULATION BY TEAMMATES SEE

01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:54.795
[inaudible]

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:57.097
SENATOR JONES.

01:38:57.164 --> 01:38:59.667
I'M SORRY -- SIR MARK READ READ

01:38:59.733 --> 01:39:01.335
AND I WANT TO CUT YOU OFF YOUR

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:01.535
HONOR.

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:04.705
I'M SORRY -- THE MANAGER I AM I

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:06.040
AM AM HIGHLY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:06.807
SOME OF THE DIALOGUE THAT WE'RE

01:39:06.874 --> 01:39:08.075
LISTENING TO RIGHT NOW AND THE

01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:09.376
TESTIMONY FROM THE WITNESS.

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:11.545
AND THE THE INFORMATION WE'RE

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:12.780
RECEIVING FROM THE DíAS.

01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:14.315
I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THESE

01:39:14.381 --> 01:39:17.151
MEDICAL SHARE PROGRAMS AT BY ANY

01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:18.118
MEANS.

01:39:18.185 --> 01:39:20.321
I AM VAGUELY FAMILIAR WITH SOME.

01:39:20.387 --> 01:39:23.557
I'M CONCERNED THAT -- I MEAN I I

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:25.326
JUST I'M.

01:39:25.392 --> 01:39:27.328
FINDING IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:28.862
THEY HAVE NO OVERSIGHT.

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:30.197
OR THAT THERE'S NO CONTRACTUAL

01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:32.032
OBLIGATION ON THESE

01:39:32.099 --> 01:39:33.233
ORGANIZATIONS TO RIDE THE

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.669
MEDICAL COVERAGE THAT THEY ARE

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:37.271
SAYING THAT THEY DO COVER.

01:39:37.338 --> 01:39:38.639
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE MIGHT BE

01:39:38.706 --> 01:39:40.140
GETTING INTO SOME RELIGIOUS

01:39:40.207 --> 01:39:42.609
FREEDOM -- CHALLENGES HERE IN

01:39:42.676 --> 01:39:44.912
SOME FIRST AMENDMENT CHALLENGES --

01:39:44.978 --> 01:39:47.314
ON THE U. S. CONSTITUTION SO I'M

01:39:47.381 --> 01:39:50.451
GONNA VOTE NO ON THAT THIS IS

01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:53.120
RIFE WITH -- POTENTIAL LEGAL

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:54.188
PROBLEMS.

01:39:54.254 --> 01:39:55.422
AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:57.257
PROPOSAL IS FULLY COOKED RIGHT

01:39:57.324 --> 01:39:58.292
NOW.

01:39:58.359 --> 01:40:00.160
AND I'M GOING TO VOTE NO I'M AND

01:40:00.227 --> 01:40:01.829
ENCOURAGE THE REST OF THE

01:40:01.895 --> 01:40:03.163
COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO.

01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:07.134
AND HAVE ENCOURAGE IN THE

01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:08.569
ADMINISTRATION AN APARTMENT

01:40:08.635 --> 01:40:10.304
FINANCE TO COME BACK.

01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:13.140
WITH MORE ANSWERS -- THAT I

01:40:13.207 --> 01:40:13.774
THINK IS CENTER MORALE BROUGHT

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:16.377
UP.

01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:17.778

SO LET ME JUST CLARIFY THAT THE

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:25.886
THIS IS NOT THE ADMINISTRATION'S.

01:40:25.953 --> 01:40:27.354
THIS ELEMENT IS NOT THE

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:28.689
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL OKAY

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:30.157
THIS IS A PART OF THE SENATE

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:31.592
PROPOSALS IN TERMS OF WHO WERE

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:32.860
MAYBE WE NEED TO GET OUR DUCKS

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:33.527
IN A ROW.

01:40:33.594 --> 01:40:35.162
TO SOLVE BUT LET ME JUST BE

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:37.231
CLEAR ABOUT -- WHEN OUR DUCKS

01:40:37.297 --> 01:40:40.033
INITIALLY SURFACED OF THIS WAS

ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T TAKE ACTION?

01:40:48.742 --> 01:40:50.477
MARCH TWENTY FIRST I JUST WOULD

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:52.346
BE CLEAR THAT THIS ISSUE HAD

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:55.315
BEEN DISCUSSED WALLY DIDN'T TAKE

01:40:55.382 --> 01:40:59.219
ACTION UNTIL TODAY -- I OUR

01:40:59.286 --> 01:41:00.087

TIME HEARING ABOUT IT -- MY READ

01:41:06.193 --> 01:41:07.194
MY CONCERNS REMAIN THE SAME OF

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:09.363
THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM --

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:10.631
CONCERNS THE FIRST AMENDMENT

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:13.066
CONCERNS AND MY APOLOGIES TO MY

01:41:13.133 --> 01:41:14.701
GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:16.904
COUNTY CENTER MORLOCK WHO I KNOW

01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:17.838
IS NOT CENTER MORALE BECAUSE

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:19.573
HE'S.

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:25.612
THERE'S A QUITE A BIT OF A

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:25.879
DIFFERENT.

01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:29.516
WEBSITE THANK YOU.

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:33.287
GOT IT -- SENATOR ROBB AND THEN

01:41:33.353 --> 01:41:36.890
BACK TO THIRD OF PANTHERA.

01:41:36.957 --> 01:41:37.891
THANK YOU MAYOR RICHARD DID I

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:38.892
GUESS MY QUESTION IS TO MY

01:41:38.959 --> 01:41:39.393
COLLEAGUES DO WE KNOW.

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.261
WITH RESPECT TO THESE RELIGIOUS

01:41:41.328 --> 01:41:42.296
MINISTRIES IF THE IF THE

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:43.197
PARTICIPANTS ACTUALLY FOR

01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:44.631
EXAMPLE USE HOSPITALS.

01:41:44.698 --> 01:41:45.599
OR IF THAT'S AGAINST THEIR

01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:47.034
RELIGIOUS TENANTS IN FACT THEY

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:47.868
PROVIDE THIS HEALTHCARE AMONG

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:48.602
THE COMMUNITY.

01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:49.803
SO I WOULD FIRST OF ALL I POINT

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:50.471
OUT THAT -- THIS -- WHAT'S BEING

01:41:50.537 --> 01:41:52.105
PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET DOES NOT

01:41:52.172 --> 01:41:53.607
ACTUALLY BANNER ELIMINATE.

01:41:53.674 --> 01:41:55.709
THESE MINISTRIES -- WHAT WE ARE

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:57.711
SAYING IS THAT THE HEALH CARE

01:41:57.778 --> 01:42:00.414
MINISTRY DOES NOT COUNT IN TERMS

01:42:00.481 --> 01:42:02.783
OF -- MEETING THE INDIVIDUAL

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:04.685
MANDATE FOR COVERAGE SO SOMEONE

01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:06.453
CAN STILL DO IT TAKE THE PENALTY

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.621
AND STILL HAVE A HEALTH CARE

01:42:07.688 --> 01:42:09.656
MINISTRY RIGHT -- THE OTHER

01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:10.791
THING I WOULD POINT OUT I MEAN

01:42:10.858 --> 01:42:11.859
THERE VARIETY DIFFERENT ONE SO

01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:14.161
YOU ASKING QUESTIONS IT DEPENDS.

01:42:14.228 --> 01:42:16.730
IT DEPENDS AND SO AS I MENTIONED

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:18.699
THEY'RE NOT REGULATED THEY DON'T

01:42:18.765 --> 01:42:20.400
DOWN THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES IN

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:21.735
PLACE IN THE FIELD FEDERAL

01:42:21.802 --> 01:42:23.070
AGENCY ABOUT BUT I MEAN OTHER

01:42:23.136 --> 01:42:24.071
WITH THE TERMS OF WHAT TO WRITE

01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:25.506
WHAT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED BUT

01:42:25.572 --> 01:42:26.907
THEY'RE NOT REGULATED.

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:28.342
AND SO THE CHALLENGE AND I WOULD

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:29.343
POINT OUT THAT ACTUALLY MOST

01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:31.945
RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS HERE IN

01:42:32.012 --> 01:42:33.313
CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY.

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:34.748
USE INSURANCE THEY DON'T USE

01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:35.582
HEALTH CARE MINISTRIES THEY

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:37.150
ACTUALLY HAVE INSURANCE THEY

01:42:37.217 --> 01:42:39.586
PROVIDE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES OR

01:42:39.653 --> 01:42:41.622
THEIR MINUTES YOU KNOW THAT THE

01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:42.523
MEMBERS WHAT AT THAT THAT THAT

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:43.924
THAT THE FOLKS WHO WORK FOR

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:44.525
THEMSELVES.

01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:45.893
THIS IS THIS IS AND WE'RE NOT

01:42:45.959 --> 01:42:47.427
BANNING THEM AT THIS IS NOT THE

01:42:47.494 --> 01:42:48.695
MAIN MECHANISM BY WHICH MOST

01:42:48.762 --> 01:42:49.796
PEOPLE GET HEALTHCARE COVERAGE

01:42:49.863 --> 01:42:51.298
EVEN AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS

01:42:51.365 --> 01:42:53.000
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:42:53.066 --> 01:42:55.469
AND SO I I I THINK THAT -- THIS

01:42:55.536 --> 01:42:57.337
IS SIMPLY ABOUT WHAT BEING SURE

01:42:57.404 --> 01:42:59.840
THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

01:42:59.907 --> 01:43:01.275
PEOPLE HAVING COVERAGE THE DATE

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:03.176
WE ARE SURE THAT THEY HAVE FORM

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:04.978
OF COVERAGE THAT MEETS THE

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:07.281
STANDARD ENSURES THAT THEY WILL

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:09.349
HAVE -- THAT THE STANDARDS THAT

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:11.285
WE'VE ESTABLISHED HERE IN THE

01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:11.952
CITY CALIFORNIA.%

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:14.321
MEDICAL TO CLARIFY JUST ONE

01:43:14.388 --> 01:43:14.721

ROCK BUT TO CLARIFY.

01:43:27.067 --> 01:43:29.136
THE ACTIONS BEING FOR POLLS

01:43:29.202 --> 01:43:30.537
DON'T THURMOND.

01:43:30.604 --> 01:43:32.506
THE HEALTH CARE MINISTRIES -- IT

SIT AROUND I APOLOGIZE A SINNER

01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:45.385

ESSENTIALLY A BAND.

01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:48.188
AND THEN AND THEN THE SALT NOW

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:49.156

TO ADD THAT THE TERMS OF A

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:52.886
WHAT WE'RE DOING THAT'S WHY THIS

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:53.920
IS BEING DISCUSSED IN THE

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:56.890
CONTEXT OF THE THIS -- THE

01:44:56.957 --> 01:44:58.558
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PORTION OF

01:44:58.625 --> 01:45:01.428
THE THIS BILL SO NOW I'M NOW I'M.

01:45:01.495 --> 01:45:05.265
ALERTED TO AN ADDITIONAL

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:08.335
CHALLENGE -- SO I'LL GO BACK TO

01:45:08.402 --> 01:45:09.269
SO TWO THINGS BACK TO

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:10.737
UNREGULATED I MEAN I JUST FIND

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:11.405
IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S

01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:13.807
NO ZERO REGULATIONS.

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:16.043
ON THESE TYPE OF SYSTEMS WHEN

01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:18.745
THE ACA RECOGNIZES THEM AS A AS

01:45:18.812 --> 01:45:21.848
A PROPER -- MEDICAL COVERAGE

01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:24.384
TOOL FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

01:45:24.451 --> 01:45:26.787
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY USE THESE --

01:45:26.853 --> 01:45:28.388
BUT I KNOW IT'S A MARKET

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:30.991
RESPONSE TO THE ACA THAT THE ACA

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:32.893
KNOWLEDGES OKAY SO NOW LET'S GO

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:34.761
BACK TO THE THE LAST POINT THE

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:36.096
DOCTOR PAN MADE.

01:45:36.163 --> 01:45:38.065
ON THE ON THE TAX RETURNS OKAY

01:45:38.131 --> 01:45:40.167
SO NOW WE'VE GOT AS A TOOL

01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:41.401
THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE RES OF

01:45:41.468 --> 01:45:42.469
THE COUNTRY.

01:45:42.536 --> 01:45:44.104
THAT YOU CAN RECOGNIZE ON YOUR

01:45:44.171 --> 01:45:46.773
IRS TAX FORMS THAT CALIFORNIA IS

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.042
NOW SAYING ON OUR TAX FORMS

01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:50.844
WE'RE NOT GOING TO RECOGNIZE IT

01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:51.878
AND IT'S NOT.

01:45:51.945 --> 01:45:55.048
AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIANS -- BUT

01:45:55.115 --> 01:45:56.483
ON OUR FEDERAL TAX FORMS IT IS

01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:58.518
SO EIGHT AGAIN I JUST GO BACK TO

01:45:58.585 --> 01:46:00.287
THE THIS IS THIS IS GOT ALL

01:46:00.353 --> 01:46:04.958
KINDS OF PROBLEMS -- AND I'M I'M.

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:06.693
I WILL LET MAKE AS MY FINAL

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:07.994
COMMENT I'M STILL VOTING NO

01:46:08.061 --> 01:46:08.995
APPRECIATE THAT BUT JUST A

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:09.629
DEPEND IF YOU WANT TO CLARIFY

01:46:09.696 --> 01:46:11.098
THAT THERE IS NO LONGER A

01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:12.532
FEDERAL MANDATE.

01:46:12.599 --> 01:46:15.102
HELLO I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT

01:46:15.168 --> 01:46:16.937
ACTUALLY.

01:46:17.003 --> 01:46:17.637
CONGRESS VOTED.

01:46:17.704 --> 01:46:19.473
TO ELIMINATE THE PENALTY ON THE

01:46:19.539 --> 01:46:20.707
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE SO

01:46:20.774 --> 01:46:22.109
TECHNICALLY WHAT HAPPENED IS

01:46:22.175 --> 01:46:24.144
CONGRESS ACTED IN THE PRESIDENT

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:24.377

01:46:26.713 --> 01:46:28.782
MANDATE ITSELF BUT MADE THE

01:46:28.849 --> 01:46:30.917
PENALTY ZERO SO THERE'S NO

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:33.887

INTERESTING ENOUGH -- I THINK

01:46:36.823 --> 01:46:38.291
BELIEVE UNDER A TRAILER BILL IF

01:46:38.358 --> 01:46:39.426
CONGRESS WOULD RESTORE THE

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:41.161
