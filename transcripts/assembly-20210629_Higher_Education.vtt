01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:18.774
INFECTIOUS DISEASE OF FUND IS-

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:26.248
EXCELLENT IDEA- SO THAT WE- DO

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:29.385
A SERIOUS RESEARCH AND TO

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:33.756
PREVENT ANY- SUCH. INFECTION

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:39.762
THAT WE- ARE UNDER- THE

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:42.698
PRESIDENT THROUGH THE NOT GOING

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:48.570
ON AND- OF BEING AFFECTED- SO

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:53.275
IN THAT- THIS IS- ENCOURAGING-

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:54.977
NOT ONLY UP NOW FEDERAL FUNDED

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:56.478
WHAT THE LOCAL AND A PRIVATE

01:11:56.545 --> 01:12:01.684
FUNDS SO ONCE THAT OF- OUR

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:03.318
SYSTEM IS ESTABLISHED OF A I'M

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:06.155
SURE THERE WILL BE- GREAT TO

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:09.625
SUPPORT ALL OF. THIS OF A FUNDA.

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:13.562
AND THE CSU- IS- WHAT I'M

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:17.566
READING MOSTLY- CSU SYSTEM SO.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:20.736
BUT I WONDER WHAT THE I'M ALL

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:26.175
FOR LOOKING OR NOT- UC SYSTEM

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:29.712
YES- NOT TO MENTION THAT HERE.

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:32.114
WAS THERE ANY REASON WHY IS WAS

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.883
THE- ANY SEPARATE STUFF- OF

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:36.518
FUNDING MECHANISM SET UP FOR

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.454
UC'S CENTER THIS IS THE FOR THE

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.825
FIRST TIME FOR ME CSU SYSTEMS.

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.493
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.629
IF I MAY ADD TO THE CHAIR. YES

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.531
UP TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OF

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:51.767
WHY NOT UC AND CSU AND REALLY

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:54.870
IT'S ABOUT EQUITY ACTUALLY UC

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:58.073
DAVIS ALREADY HAS- BIOSECURITY

01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.441
RESEARCH THAT THEY DO THAT THE

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:01.443
FOCUS ON WILDLIFE- FROM MY

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.946
UNDERSTANDING. OF THE REASON

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:06.215
WHY THERE IS A FOCUS ON ON AND

01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:08.283
AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURAL

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:12.287
REGIONS AND ALSO- THE CSU THAT

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:14.623
ARE FOCUSED OR THAT ARE STE YOU

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:18.827
KNOW- IN THOSE REGIONS. IS

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:20.896
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF WORD

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:22.998
INFECTIOUS DISEASES COME FROM.

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:26.235
AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF. DON'T

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:28.103
LIKE IT I BELIEVE UNCERTAINTY

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:31.640
AS TO HOW KALRA NINETEEN CAME

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.108
ABOUT I MEAN IT THERE'S AN

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:35.244
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT CAME

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:38.347
FROM- FROM AN ANIMAL RIGHT AND

01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:40.482
SO. WE REALLY GOT A LOOK AT

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:42.851
THOSE THOSE COMMUNITIES AND

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:43.685
PROVIDE AN EQUITABLE

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:44.853
OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS AND

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.022
THOSE COMMUNITIES TO DO

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:48.957
RESEARCH ABOUT WHAT IMPACTS

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:51.059
THEM AS WELL AND SO IT'S REALLY

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:52.861
MORE OF AN EQUITY ISSUE- NOT SO

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:57.332
MUCH OF. YOU KNOW LEAVING AT A

01:13:57.399 --> 01:14:00.435
PARTICULAR A SYSTEM OUT- I

01:14:00.502 --> 01:14:01.470
THINK THIS WILL BRING A

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:02.905
BALANCED APPROACH TO OUR

01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:06.308
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND REALLY-

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.076
WHAT THE CLIMATE CHANGING WORLD

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:09.645
IT NEEDS TO BE KIND OF AN LL

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:11.480
HANDS ON DECK WHEN IT COMES TO

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:14.082
SOLUTIONS AND TO REALLY HAVE A

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:17.219
TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASES-

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.654
SUCH AS THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.556
EXAMPLE WAS GIVEN EARLIER ON

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.524
VALLEY FEVER BY DOCTOR BAINES.

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:23.392
VALLEY FEVER FOR THE MOST PART

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:24.960
HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:26.695
SPECIFIC TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:28.797
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE YOUR

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:30.299
VALLEY FEVER MAY NOT BE YOU

01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:31.900
KNOW MAY NOT BE THE NEXT

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:32.734
PANDEMIC HERE IN THE UNITED

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:36.138
STATES WELL WE GOT A STUDY THAT

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:37.372
RIGHT WE GOTTA MAKE SURE THAT

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:40.475
WE HAVE INVESTED IN AND WE HAVE

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:42.477
A DEDICATED CENTER AND RESEARCH

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.613
TO THAT- AND NOBODY'S GOING TO

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.249
KNOW IT BETTER THAN PEOPLE THAT

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.517
ARE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:49.818
THIRTY EIGHT SPECIFIC BUT IT'S

01:14:49.885 --> 01:14:50.586
ALSO LIKE I SAID IT'S AN

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:54.323
EQUITY- IT'S ABOUT HAVING A-

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:56.325
THAT EQUITY THROUGHOUT THE

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:58.427
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND RESEARCH.

01:14:58.493 --> 01:15:04.099
THANK YOU DR WEBER. THANK YOU

ASKED MY STAFF WITH THEM A

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:12.941
QUESTION ABOUT THIS BILL IN

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:15.410

SO IT'S AT THE C. ISSUES THAT

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:26.021
ARE WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:28.857

THAT IT HAPPENS TO BE IN AN

AREA THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:20.902
THE ORIGIN. RIGHT WE'VE GOT

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:22.137
