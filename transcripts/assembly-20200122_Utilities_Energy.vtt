INCREASING THE GRAVITY OF THE

00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:14.525
SITUATION IS THE FACT THAT

SHORTAGES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED

00:33:57.468 --> 00:33:59.170
IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IT

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:00.371
WAS DISTURBING TO LEARN A

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:01.839
POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT

00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:04.075
GENERATION SHORTAGES WHICH SEEM

00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:06.611
TO CATCH THE CPUC BY SURPRISE

00:34:06.677 --> 00:34:08.079
IT APPEARS THAT THREE FACTORS

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:09.447
LARGELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:12.550
SHORTFALL. FIRST A DECADE AGO

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:14.152

COMPLIANCE DATE IS NEARLY UPON

00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:26.597
US. MANY OF THESE THERMAL

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:34.705
SECOND IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO

00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:35.506
THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT THE CQC

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:37.175
LOWERED THE CAPACITY FACTOR

00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:40.077
FROM SOLAR. WHICH LED TO A NEAR

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:43.080

THOSE RETIREMENTS OF CAUSE A

00:34:54.091 --> 00:34:55.393
REDUCTION OF GENERATION

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.495
AVAILABLE FOR IMPORT. IT'S

00:34:57.562 --> 00:34:58.763
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.431
CPUC DID NOT APPRECIATE THE

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:02.467

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:33.515
INTERNAL PROCESSES SO I THINK

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:37.252
WE NEED- TO LOOK AT HOW WE HOW

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:38.887
WE DO OUR OWN BUSINESS IF YOU

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:40.956
WELL I'D AND DO A LITTLE BIT OF

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:41.923
BUSINESS RE ENGINEERING WHICH

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:45.660
THEY HAVE. DONE ADMIRABLY AND-

01:17:45.727 --> 01:17:47.529
SO I WON'T I CAN'T TAKE CREDIT

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:48.830
FOR THAT WHAT I DO HOPE TO DO

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:50.265
IS TO JOIN THEM IN THEIR

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:51.833
EFFORTS OF MAKING OUR INTERNAL

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.668
PROCESSES MORE EFFECTIVE AND

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:56.972
MORE. NUMBER IF I MAY USE A

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:59.307
WORD AGAIN THAT'S I THINK OUR

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:01.676
FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS BECAUSE

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:03.678
OF THE ACTIVITIES AS I HAVE

01:18:03.745 --> 01:18:05.013
OUTLINED ALONG WITH THE

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.082
BANKRUPTCY I WOULD HATE TO

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:12.220
PLEDGE TO YOU. THIS YEAR. ON IN

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:15.157
MY TERM- WHETHER I'M GOING TO

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:17.459
BE ABLE TO TACKLE. REFORM THAT

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:18.827
WOULD GO TO AN ABSOLUTE

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:21.029
REORGANIZATION IN SOME CASES

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:21.797
THAT MAY EVEN TAKE A

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:22.898
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AS

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:25.434
YOU'RE WELL AWARE SO WE WILL BE

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.335
LOOKING AT THAT BUT I THINK WE

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:30.672
HAVE A GOOD START ON CLEANING

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:34.042
UP. PRIORITIZING SOME REFORMS

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:35.444
WITHIN OUR OWN PROCESSES AND

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:38.647
THAT'S A MORE IMMEDIATE FOCUS

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:41.416
FOR ME. OKAY AND THEN. MY NEXT

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:43.518
I THINK IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:45.187
THERE'S NOTHING MORE MOTIVATING

01:18:45.253 --> 01:18:47.255
I THINK IN THE WILD FIRES AND I

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:48.723
HAVE FAMILY POINT MY MOTHER

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:50.525
LIVES IN ORVILLE SO EVERY TIME

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:53.095
THERE IS A HE SHUT DOWN I MEAN

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:54.296
THEY ARE AFFECTED AND I HEAR

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:55.497
ABOUT IT ANY WORK IN THE TIMBER

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:56.765
INDUSTRY. SO I'VE HEARD A LOT

01:18:56.832 --> 01:19:00.602
ABOUT THAT AS WE SO THEN MY

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:02.104
GUESS MY OTHER POINT M. AND

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.205
I'LL SAY BUT THE IT IT IS IT

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:04.873
CREATES ANXIETY AS YOU WELL

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.274
KNOW ALL ACROSS THE STATE IS

01:19:06.341 --> 01:19:07.943
NOT JUST PEOPLE LIVE IN FIRE.

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:10.345
HI FIRE AREAS THE TREE DOWN TO

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.714
EVERYBODY WORRYING ABOUT WHAT

01:19:12.781 --> 01:19:14.583

NEED CLEAN UP OUR FOR AND WE

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:58.727

AND I WE SHOULD AT IT WITH

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:09.905
DIFFERENT LINE. WAS DRIVING OUT

WITH MA'AM QUIRK AND WITH MY

01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:49.377
EGGMAN OB A OF THE SIMILAR

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:50.345
CONCERN OF MISTER IN A LOT OF

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:53.014
THE SIMILAR OB TO AS- AG WITH

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:54.015
WITH RESPECT TO THE CONCERT. OF

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:57.452
THE WILD THE SHOT DOWNS ON MY

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:58.653
DAUGHTERS IN LAW TWO OF OUR

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.824
FOUR GRAND LIVE IN NORTH FOR.

01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:05.594
AS WE'VE HAD OUR SHARE OF THREE

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:06.895
AND FOUR NIGHT IT'S WHEN THEY

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.330
STAYED WITH US INSTEAD OF FOR

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:12.500
DOWN THE VALLEY. BUT I WANTED

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:15.971
IT. MAKE THIS UP AND ASK MAY

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:21.243
BEFORE. A COMMENT BECAUSE. WE

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:24.879
ARE WOULD WE ARE FOCUSED HERE

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:29.117
ON G. H. OUR IMAGE IF YOU LOOK

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:30.752
AT CHARTS BY CATEGORY AND ALL

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:34.089
OF THAT. WHICH BASICALLY SAYS

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:39.561
GHGS HAVE BEEN COMING DOWN. IN

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:43.398
THIS ANALYSIS. THE EMISSIONS OF

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:46.968
GHGS OF CARBON BY THE FOREST

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:50.639
FIRES ARE NOT COUNTED. IT'S MY

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:55.076
ESTIMATION THAT IF WE DID COUNT

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:58.346
THE FOREST FIRES. WE WILL BE

01:21:58.413 --> 01:21:59.748
BLOWN A HOLE IN THESE MEGA

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:01.950
EMISSION REDUCTIONS SO WE'RE

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:05.587
BASICALLY PRETENDING. THAT WITH

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:06.554
ALL OF THE DECISIONS ON ALL OF

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:10.125
THE- RULES REGULATIONS AND THE

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:11.493
BILLS PASSED ON ALL OF THAT.

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:15.330
WHEN POINT OF FACT. THESE

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:18.266
FOREST FIRES AND WHAT THEY ARE

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.302
DOING TO GHG EMISSIONS IS

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:23.605
SIMPLY BLOWN A HOLE. AT THE END

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.607
AND I THINK- WE PROBABLY HAVE

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.676
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS A

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:31.513
NET INCREASE OF GHG EMISSIONS.

01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:33.915
IS THERE ANY EFFORT TO TRY AND

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:37.085
TRACK AND SOMEHOW INTEGRATE

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:42.357
INTO THESE. REDUCTIONS THE GHG

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:43.525
EMISSIONS OF THESE POOREST

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:48.363
BUYERS. I IT'S AN EXCELLENT

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:49.597
EXCELLENT QUESTION AN EXCELLENT

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.066
POINT AND I HAVE SEEN

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:52.734
STATISTICS WELL BEFORE I JOINED

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:55.870
THE CPUC ABOUT WHAT THE FOUGHT

01:22:55.937 --> 01:22:57.605
WILD FIRES AND SEVENTEEN AND

01:22:57.672 --> 01:22:59.374
EIGHTEEN DID JUST TO THAT AND

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:03.211
WHAT. IT ADDED TO- TO THE G. H.

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:06.514
G. IN IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:09.117
VERSUS TAKING SO MANY CARS OFF

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:10.919
THE HIGHWAY OR BRINGING ON SO

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:11.853
MANY ELECTRIC CARS DO YOU DO

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.721
YOU WANT TO SEE SOME

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:15.857
SPECIFICALLY. I WOULD I JUST

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:16.758
GOT SAID THAT'S REALLY THE

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:19.294
QUESTION FOR THIS IS NOT THE

01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.096
DOCTOR BUT FOR A RESOURCE BOARD

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:22.797
ON THE SLY THAT WE IF YOU'LL

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:23.832
NOTE THE ARE ALL FOR THE AIR RE

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:26.368
BOARD AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF

01:23:26.434 --> 01:23:29.637
US UP ARE- TAIJI ACCOUNT

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:32.474
SCIENCE. I DO KNOW THAT

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.442
TRACKING THE WILD FIRED

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.745
MISSIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER ONES

01:23:36.811 --> 01:23:38.680
IS NOT A STRICT ONE FOR ONE

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:41.049
ANALYSIS- BECAUSE OF THE

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:42.784
ABILITY OF THE FOREST TO BE A

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.452
CARBON SINK ON IN BECAUSE THE

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:46.654
TIMING IN WHICH THE FORESTRY

01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:49.424
GROWS AND IN WHICH IT WAS THE

01:23:49.491 --> 01:23:51.793
SAME TO START IT YOU HAVE TO DO

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:52.394
A MUCH DEEPER ALICE SAID IF I

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.731
GO FURTHER THAN THAT. YOUR I

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:59.100
MEAN I SHOW THAT'S INTO MY NOW

01:23:59.167 --> 01:23:59.934
ON THAT OTHER THAN THE POINT

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.636
BACK TO THE AIR BEES ON

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.638
ANALYSIS TO ADDRESS WAS QUITE

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:05.206
BUT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM AT

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:07.142
ALL IN. IN THAT DAY WITH THEIR

01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:09.444
I THINK IT I TO SOME SOME IT

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:12.113
INTERESTING IN HOW WE TO THE

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:13.047
ONE FOR ONE OR THE COMPARISONS

01:24:13.114 --> 01:24:14.749
I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:16.084
TO LET YOU KNOW AND I THINK

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:17.485
IT'S VERY I THINK IT'S REALLY.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:20.722
QUITE IMPORTANT BECAUSE I DON'T

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:28.296
THINK WE SHOULD. BE PRETENDING.

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:29.164
AND QUITE FRANKLY THE- FIRES

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.499
ARE IN. I THINK CONTRIBUTING SO.

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:34.235
AT WE ARE RE. A PARTICULAR IN

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:36.571
AGRA PART IN. AND ALL. THE

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:39.007
ELECTRICITY RATES AND THE

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:40.341
REGULATORY STUFF IS REALLY

01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:42.444
DRIVING COSTS UP IT'S QUITE

01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:47.449
FRANKLY DRIVING A LOT OF-

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:48.550
ORGANIZATIONS OUT OF THE STATE

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:50.084
OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:52.053
COST FACTOR IN ALL OF THAT. MY

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:56.357
POINT IN THIS IS THAT. TO KNOW

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:59.360
THE DEGREE TO WHICH- THE FOREST

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:04.966
FIRES. PUSH THE G. H. G. UP.

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:07.635
WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE IT

01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:09.304
I THINK BEGS THE QUESTION THAT

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:10.438
IF WE'RE GOING TO USE THE GHG

01:25:10.505 --> 01:25:13.208
FUNDS. THAT SO MUCH OF THOSE

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.410
FUNDS OUGHT TO BE DEDICATED TO

01:25:15.477 --> 01:25:18.112
FORCE MANAGEMENT AND TO GETTING

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:22.417
THESE FOREST'S- CLEANED UP SEND

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:25.487
THE FUEL STE BROUGHT DOWN. AND

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:27.155
I'M NOT IF I HAD MY WAY I'D

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:28.756
DIED USE EVERY PENNY. QUITE

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:31.559
FRANKLY THIS IS THE CHALLENGE

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:33.228
NOT ONLY OF THE FOREST FIRES

01:25:33.294 --> 01:25:37.198
COST AND DANGER IT IS ALSO

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:40.301
BASICALLY MASKING. ARE THE REAL.

01:25:40.368 --> 01:25:42.237
THAT HAVE BEEN THAT MADE AND

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:43.905
CARBON. SO I DON'T THINK WE

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:44.873
SHOULD BE PAT OURSELVES ON THE

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:46.374
BACK FOR THESE REDUCTIONS WHEN

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:48.743
IN FACT WE SEE. ARE THAT THEY

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:51.546
ARE EXPLODING. THAT'S TRUE WE

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:52.780
NEED TO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:54.582
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON GAGE AND

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:56.651
ASSESS IT. THEN WE CAN MAKE

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:58.253
REALLY GOOD INFORMED DECISIONS

01:25:58.319 --> 01:25:59.721
WITH RESPECT OF WHAT DO WE DO

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:01.923
WITH THESE GHG. FUNDS AND WHAT

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:04.559
DO WE DO WITH THESE OTHER.

01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:07.161
ABILITY OF- BIOMASS IN THESE

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:09.330
OTHER. KINDS OF SET OF

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:14.335
APPRECIATE THAT WHATEVER YOU

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:17.238
MIGHT HAVE SAY WITH. TO THAT

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:17.839
OUT I KNOW THAT THEIR PROBABLY

01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:20.041
DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR. BUT

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:22.744
CALIFORNIA DOES. ACCOUNT FOR A

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:24.979
LOT OF THIS AND WE BELIEVE IT

01:26:25.046 --> 01:26:26.981
AS GOSPEL. I'M NOT CONVINCED

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:28.283
THAT WE CAN BELIEVE THAT WE'RE

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:29.617
REDUCING GHG IF WE DON'T

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:31.486
ACCOUNT FOR FOREST FIRES AND

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:32.387
THAT'S GOING TO INFORM OUR

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:34.522
DECISIONS WITH RESPECT GHG

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:35.590
FUNDS THAT WE SPEND. I'M

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:37.225
REMINDED THAT ARE WILDFIRES

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:39.193
STRATEGIES AND CAROLINE CAN

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.163
ADDRESSES TAKE IN TO ACCOUNT-

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:45.266
CLIMATE GOALS WHICH OF COURSE

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:46.901
INCLUDES THE GHG. COUNTY ONE OF

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:48.269
AND THEN SEAT ANYTHING FURTHER

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:50.438
ON THAT SURE SO ONE OF THE

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:52.840
THINGS WE DID RESEARCH ON OUR

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:54.275
CURRENT STATE WAS AND WHAT BEST

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:56.044

NEEDS SO WHAT WHAT ARE WE

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:12.860
DRIVING TOWARDS AND WE CREATED

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:14.329
A STEERING COMMITTEE TO INFORM

PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSING THAT

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.278
SIGNIFICANT COST SHIFT ISSUE.

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:19.781
I'M GOING TO TURN TO MY

01:30:19.847 --> 01:30:21.215
COLLEAGUE MISTER RANDOLPH TO

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:23.151

TERMS TO THE TIMING IN THE TWO

01:30:26.587 --> 01:30:27.755
THOUSAND NINETEEN DATE- WHEN

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:30.358
THE COMMISSION HAD- APPROVED

01:30:30.424 --> 01:30:31.826
WHAT WE CALLED IN AND TWO POINT

01:30:31.893 --> 01:30:34.796
NO- WHICH WAS IN RESPONSE TO.

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:39.600
THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION IN SB

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:40.635
THREE TWENTY SEVEN. WE HAD AND

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:42.537
COME TO DO A REVIEW. OF THAT

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:44.038
DECISION IN TWO THOUSAND

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:46.908
NINETEEN. BOB THE TWO THOUSAND

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:49.310
NINETEEN TIMING- WAS BASED ON

01:30:49.377 --> 01:30:51.212
THE FACT THAT IN THAT SAME.

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:52.914
SERIES OF DECISIONS THE

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:56.317
COMMISSION HAD ALSO- DIRECTED

01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:58.052
THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO

01:30:58.119 --> 01:31:01.155
MOVE TO- PARADIGM OF TIME OF

01:31:01.222 --> 01:31:03.357
USE RATES FOR THE RESIDENTIAL

01:31:03.424 --> 01:31:05.359
CUSTOMERS. AND WE THOUGHT THE

01:31:05.426 --> 01:31:07.562
BEST TIMING FROM BOTH THE

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:08.563
CUSTOMER AND TAX AND POINT IN

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:12.166
AND- ANALYTICAL STANDPOINT WAS

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:12.733
TO LET THE TIME OF USE RATES

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.204
ROLL OUT FOR. UNDER THE IMPACT

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.472
OF THE THEN REVISIT NET ENERGY

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:19.941
METERING AND THAT THAT'S VERY

01:31:20.007 --> 01:31:21.976
FOR AN AND STAY. BECAUSE COST

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:24.145
SHIFT THAT YOU REFERENCED WHICH

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:25.947
THAT NUMBERS FROM- GOV FAIRLY

01:31:26.013 --> 01:31:28.516
OLD STUDY- WITH BASED ON THE

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:30.551
OLD RATE STRUCTURE- IN THAT

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:33.387
RATE STRUCTURE WILL CHANGE. IN

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:35.423
THE COST IMPACTS OF KNIT OF NET

01:31:35.489 --> 01:31:36.991
ENERGY METERING WILL CHANGE

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:39.861
WHEN CUSTOMERS MOVE FROM- A

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:40.895
TIERED RATE STRUCTURE WHICH

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:42.864
THEY WERE ON TO THE TIME OF USE

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:44.565
RATE STRUCTURE. WHAT'S HAPPENED

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:45.766
BOB WELL SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:47.335
SEND YOUR GAS ELECTRIC IS NOW

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:48.936
IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THAT

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:51.639
TIME OF USE RATES- THE OTHER

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:54.342
TWO WERE DELAYED- BECAUSE THE

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:55.476
COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT ARE

01:31:55.543 --> 01:32:00.448
NEEDED- TO PROVIDE GOOD BILL

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:02.149
INFORMATION TO THE CUSTOMER'S.

01:32:02.216 --> 01:32:03.484
EXPRESSION THAT FIRST YEAR

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:04.619
BECAUSE THE UTILITIES ARE

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:06.053
REQUIRED BY LAW TO DO SHADOW

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.455
BUILDING WHERE EACH MONTH

01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:08.389
YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW WHAT YOUR

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:10.157
BILL IS ON TIME OF USE RATES

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:11.492
AND THEN YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT IT

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:12.660
IS ON THE OLD RATE STRUCTURE.

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:14.061
AND AT THE END OF THAT FIRST

01:32:14.128 --> 01:32:16.163
YEAR IF YOUR RATES WOULD HAVE

01:32:16.230 --> 01:32:17.331
BEEN LOWER ON THE OLD RATE

01:32:17.398 --> 01:32:18.833
STRUCTURE GOING TO BE REFUNDED

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:23.004
THE DIFFERENCE I'M ALL THAT

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:26.774
REQUIRES. FAIRLY UP TO DATE CAN

01:32:26.841 --> 01:32:28.209
JUST SO THE SAN DIEGO IS READY

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:30.411
TO GO THE OTHER. UTILITIES NEED

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:32.880
TO UPGRADE THEIR- OVERALL FOR A

01:32:32.947 --> 01:32:33.948
BUNCH OF REASONS- THEIR

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:36.083
COMPUTER SYSTEMS. I'M IN SO WE

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:37.451
DECIDED THE WISE THING TO DO

01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:39.320
WAS TO WAIT UNTIL THOSE

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.889
UPGRADES ARE IN PLACE. BEFORE

01:32:41.956 --> 01:32:43.557
THEY ROLL OUT THEIR TIME OF USE

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:45.226
RATES ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS

01:32:45.293 --> 01:32:47.194
THAT'LL HAPPEN WITH P. JEANNIE

01:32:47.261 --> 01:32:49.597
EACH CUSTOMER'S. STARTING THIS

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:52.833
FALL. AND THEN IT WILL HAPPEN-

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.969
WITH A SMALL SEGMENT OF EDISON

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:56.137
CUSTOMERS ALSO STARTING THIS

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:57.405
FALL. AND THEN THEY HAVE

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:59.440
ACTUALLY REQUESTED A ANOTHER

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:01.509
DELAY FOR I BELIEVE NINE

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:04.145
MONTHS- DUE TO SOME ISSUES

01:57:18.598 --> 01:57:19.966
AND I DON'T KNOW TO CAN EXPAND

01:57:20.032 --> 01:57:20.666

THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:30.610
RANDOLPH DISK IT'S SERIES OF

01:57:30.676 --> 01:57:32.512
EVENTS THAT WERE GOING THROUGH

01:57:32.578 --> 01:57:34.981
OUR PROCEEDINGS IF YOU WILL AND

01:57:35.047 --> 01:57:38.351
WITH WITH THE TIME OF USE AS

01:57:38.418 --> 01:57:40.920
WELL AS WITH. I'M ED CAN I

01:57:40.987 --> 01:57:42.522
SUPPOSE ANYONE ON ANY OTHER

01:57:42.588 --> 01:57:44.490
TIME FRAMES THAT WE OULD HELP-

01:57:44.557 --> 01:57:47.093
MISTER SANTIAGO WITH. THE

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:48.194
BIGGEST COMMITMENT IS WERE

01:57:48.261 --> 01:57:50.663
START- AND YOU'RE NOT ATTACKING

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:51.931
INTO THE BIGGEST COMMITMENT IS

01:57:51.998 --> 01:57:53.933
WE ARE STARTING THE PROCESS AS

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.902
I SAID I KIND OF GLOSSED OVER.

01:57:55.968 --> 01:57:58.438
AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:57:58.504 --> 01:58:00.807
DOING THE INITIAL- COST BENEFIT

01:58:00.873 --> 01:58:05.745
ANALYSIS- THAT WILL BE NEEDED

01:58:05.812 --> 01:58:07.113
TO MAKE THE NEXT DECISION AS I

01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:10.049
SAID BEFORE THAT- THE TWO

01:58:10.116 --> 01:58:12.618
BILLION DOLLAR COST SHIP NUMBER

01:58:12.685 --> 01:58:16.189
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT IS

01:58:16.255 --> 01:58:18.024
BASED ON A STUDY WITH BET ON IT

01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:20.526
ALL BREAK. NOW THAT WOULD. BE

01:58:20.593 --> 01:58:23.463
NEW RAGE. REFRESH SEVEN MY

01:58:23.529 --> 01:58:24.530
THINK THAT NUMB ACTUALLY UP

01:58:24.597 --> 01:58:26.666
BEING LOWER BY ALL ON THE FLIP

01:58:26.732 --> 01:58:28.668
SO THINK THAT OLD STUDY YOU

01:58:28.734 --> 01:58:29.502
COULD LOOK AT IT IN VARIOUS

01:58:29.569 --> 01:58:30.837
DIFFERENT WAYS AND HOW YOU

01:58:30.903 --> 01:58:32.705
DEFINE SHIFT I THINK GOING

01:58:32.772 --> 01:58:35.174
FORWARD WILL BE CLEARER- BUT

01:58:35.241 --> 01:58:37.143
THAT YOU KNOW WHO'S BENEFITING

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:38.110
WHO'S NOT WILL MAKE IT MUCH

01:58:38.177 --> 01:58:40.346
EASIER TO THE DESIGN A NEW

01:58:40.413 --> 01:58:43.216
PROGRAM- COULD WE GET SOMETHING

01:58:43.282 --> 01:58:47.086
DONE BY JUNE CAN WE- BE. THE

01:58:47.153 --> 01:58:47.653
WELL THE ARE WAY TO MAKE IT

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:50.623
THIS. EARLY NEXT YEAR- I THINK

01:58:50.690 --> 01:58:51.891
THAT'S A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY

01:58:51.958 --> 01:58:52.492
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:58:52.558 --> 01:58:55.094
HOPING FOR. HIS OWN REASONS AYE

01:58:55.161 --> 01:58:56.963
AYE MA'AM MISTER. IS ONE OF THE

01:58:57.029 --> 01:58:57.797
REASONS I ASKING I'M-

01:58:57.864 --> 01:59:01.167
ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT. BUT IF THE

01:59:01.234 --> 01:59:03.002
FOLKS IN MY EAR I CAN'T AFFORD

01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:05.404
IT. AND DON'T HAVE IT. WHAT'S

01:59:05.471 --> 01:59:07.573
THE COST TO THEM WHAT MANY IN

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.275
IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AT THE

01:59:09.342 --> 01:59:11.644
OTHER SIDE REMEMBER THAT THE

01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:14.213

IT'S POINT TO ME WHY THERE'S A

02:01:24.076 --> 02:01:26.145
SENSE OF URGENCY- TO ADDRESS

02:01:26.212 --> 02:01:27.980

THAT THE AND- AND THE COST THAT

02:23:53.992 --> 02:23:56.861
THAT WAS BEARING ON RATEPAYERS.

02:23:56.928 --> 02:23:59.397
CERTAINLY WITH THE FINANCING

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE

02:24:01.399 --> 02:24:02.533
UTILITIES IN THE STRUGGLE THAT

02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:04.635
THEY WERE GOING THROUGH OF THE

02:24:04.702 --> 02:24:07.271
ONLY VIABLE SOLUTION- THAT CAME

02:24:07.338 --> 02:24:10.008
FORWARD WAS TO EXTEND THE-

02:24:10.074 --> 02:24:12.510
DELIVERY OUR CHARGE. AND THAT

02:24:12.577 --> 02:24:14.278
CREATING THE FUNDED CREATED A

02:24:14.345 --> 02:24:16.514
BALANCE WHERE SHAREHOLDERS PUT

MONEY INTO THE FUND AS WELL. AT

02:24:20.018 --> 02:24:20.985
THINK ABOUT ALL. OF WAS

02:24:21.052 --> 02:24:22.153
PROBABLY A REALLY APPROPRIATE

02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:25.256
WAY TO SORT OF- HAVE A SOLUTION

02:24:25.323 --> 02:24:27.258
THAT BROUGHT SHAREHOLDERS TO

02:24:27.325 --> 02:24:28.359
THE TABLE WHICH HAD NOT

02:24:28.426 --> 02:24:30.328
HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY AND THEREBY

02:24:30.395 --> 02:24:31.996
RELIEVING SOME OF THE PRESSURE

02:24:32.063 --> 02:24:35.033
ON RATE PAYERS. THERE WAS A AS

02:24:35.099 --> 02:24:37.935
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- YOUR

02:24:38.002 --> 02:24:39.604
OFFICE WENT FORWARD I GUESS

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:41.606
AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL

02:24:41.672 --> 02:24:44.876
WITH. CONCERNS AND OPPOSITION

02:24:44.942 --> 02:24:47.512
TO THE USE OF THE FUND. AND OUR

02:24:47.578 --> 02:24:50.081
EXTENSION OF THE DATA BE OUR

02:24:50.148 --> 02:24:53.584
CHARGE AND- I GUESS NOT HAVING

02:24:53.651 --> 02:24:55.787
HEARD THAT CAN STE AND WHILE WE

02:24:55.853 --> 02:24:57.288
WERE TO BE LIBERAL. AROUND THAT

02:24:57.355 --> 02:25:00.725
SOLUTIONS. BECAUSE PAUSE AND

02:25:00.792 --> 02:25:03.027
WONDER IF THAT WAS NOT THE

02:25:03.094 --> 02:25:05.396
RIGHT WAY TO GO. WHAT OPTIONS

02:25:05.463 --> 02:25:06.798
ARE WATER OF OTHER APPROACHES

02:25:06.864 --> 02:25:08.699
WOULD YOU HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT

02:25:08.766 --> 02:25:11.869
WE HAVE TAKEN. TO ADDRESS THE

02:25:11.936 --> 02:25:13.805
IMMEDIACY OF THE CRISIS IF YOU

02:25:13.871 --> 02:25:16.674
WELL IN THAT MOMENT- AND SO I

02:25:16.741 --> 02:25:18.276
GUESS THAT WOULD BE MY QUESTION

02:25:18.342 --> 02:25:20.578
OF BECAUSE WE HAD NOT GONE DOWN

02:25:20.645 --> 02:25:23.214
THAT PATH. THEN WE WOULD. BE IN

02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:26.417
A PLACE I THINK OF- EVEN

02:25:26.484 --> 02:25:28.453
INCREASE PAYROLL AND- INCREASE

02:25:28.519 --> 02:25:31.155
IMPACT ON REPAIRS IN PROBABLY

02:25:31.222 --> 02:25:33.157
ANOTHER UTILITY IN BANKRUPTCY-

02:25:33.224 --> 02:25:35.460
I. JUST THROW THAT OUT BECAUSE

02:25:35.526 --> 02:25:38.029
I WAS A LITTLE I PONDERED. WHY

02:25:38.096 --> 02:25:40.698
WE HAD NOT HEARD THE OPPOSITION

02:25:40.765 --> 02:25:45.870
DURING THE FOUR OF. TEN FIFTY

02:25:45.937 --> 02:25:47.438
FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEAR

02:25:47.505 --> 02:25:48.473
CHEN I APPRECIATE THAT AND

02:25:48.539 --> 02:25:50.942
CERTAINLY. IN THE FUTURE WE

02:25:51.008 --> 02:25:53.044
WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. IN

02:25:53.111 --> 02:25:55.046
CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND YOUR

02:25:55.113 --> 02:25:56.848
COLLEAGUES AND RAISING ANY

02:25:56.914 --> 02:26:00.585
CONCERNS IN REAL TIME- IN TERMS

02:26:00.651 --> 02:26:02.653
OF YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE ARE IN

02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:04.188
A REALLY TOUGH PLACE IN TERMS

02:26:04.255 --> 02:26:06.524
OF TRYING TO SET UP. A FUND

02:26:06.591 --> 02:26:08.126
THAT COULD HELP UTILITIES TO

02:26:08.192 --> 02:26:12.230
STATE. THE TO SPREAD THE COSTS

02:26:12.296 --> 02:26:14.265
OF THE WILD FIRES AND TO

02:26:14.332 --> 02:26:16.100
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE RELIABLE

02:26:16.167 --> 02:26:18.703
ELECTRICITY SERVICE- WE DID

02:26:18.769 --> 02:26:20.404
HAVE SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS

02:26:20.471 --> 02:26:22.140
ABOUT THE FUN WE WORST IN

02:26:22.206 --> 02:26:24.475
PARTICULAR WE WERE- THE INITIAL

02:26:24.542 --> 02:26:26.144
LANGUAGE IT WASN'T ENTIRELY

02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:27.745
CLEAR IF THERE WOULD BE AN

02:26:27.812 --> 02:26:30.348
OPPORTUNITY FOR. FOR UTILITIES

02:26:30.414 --> 02:26:33.017
TO BE ABLE TO BE- PAID THROUGH

02:26:33.084 --> 02:26:34.318
THE FUND AND THEN ALSO GO BACK

02:26:34.385 --> 02:26:37.688
AND RECOVER THAT COST FROM FROM

02:26:37.755 --> 02:26:40.591
CUSTOMERS- SO THAT THAT WAS

02:26:40.658 --> 02:26:42.393
CLARIFIED OF BOTH BY THE

02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:44.562
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND BY THE P.

02:26:44.629 --> 02:26:45.930
YOU SEE THAT THAT WAS NOT THE

02:26:45.997 --> 02:26:48.099
INTENT AND- AND SO THAT WAS

02:26:48.166 --> 02:26:49.834
THAT CLEARED UP ONE OF OUR- BIG

02:26:49.901 --> 02:26:52.870
CONCERNS- AND I THINK WHAT I'M-

02:26:52.937 --> 02:26:54.071
GONNA DO IS. IS TURN TO DR

02:26:54.138 --> 02:26:55.173
SKINNER AND SEE IF HE WOULD

02:26:55.239 --> 02:26:57.542
LIKE TO. ADD ANYTHING TO THAT

02:26:57.608 --> 02:26:58.643
BUT I THINK THAT WHAT THAT WAS

02:26:58.709 --> 02:27:01.679
OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WITH WITH

02:27:01.746 --> 02:27:02.246
THE FUND AND THAT WAS LATER

02:27:02.313 --> 02:27:05.583
CLARIFIED. THE ONLY OTHER ITEM

02:27:05.650 --> 02:27:06.918
THAT I WOULD ADD IS THAT THE

02:27:06.984 --> 02:27:08.753
OTHER CONCERN WOULD BE. BECAUSE

02:27:08.819 --> 02:27:11.656
THESE CHARGES ARE BEING. LEVY

02:27:11.722 --> 02:27:13.491
IT PRIOR TO KNOWING WHETHER OR

02:27:13.558 --> 02:27:15.059
NOT A PARTICULAR UTILITY MAY BE

02:27:15.126 --> 02:27:17.495
PART OF THE APPLICABLE ENTITIES

02:27:17.562 --> 02:27:18.696
FOR THE FUND IN THIS CASE PGA

02:27:18.763 --> 02:27:20.631
ANY WHAT HAPPENS IF THE

02:27:20.698 --> 02:27:22.600
SURCHARGES AUTHORIZED UPON ALL

02:27:22.667 --> 02:27:24.302

02:27:24.368 --> 02:27:25.236
IF THEY FAILED TO EMERGE FROM

02:27:25.303 --> 02:27:27.638
BANKRUPTCY- BY THE END OF JUNE

02:27:27.705 --> 02:27:29.941
OF THIS YEAR. AND THUS WOULD BE

02:27:30.007 --> 02:27:31.642
AN ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION

02:27:31.709 --> 02:27:33.177
IN THE FUND P. GINNY'S

02:27:33.244 --> 02:27:34.178
CUSTOMERS WOULD POTENTIALLY GET

02:27:34.245 --> 02:27:36.414
CHARGED. BUT THE UTILITY WITH

02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:38.416
AND BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THOSE

02:27:38.482 --> 02:27:40.618
FUNDS TO THE LANGUAGE OF AB TEN

02:27:40.685 --> 02:27:43.221
FIFTY FOUR. WELL I KNOW THAT AS

02:27:43.287 --> 02:27:46.023
WE ARE. WATCHING THIS REAL TIME

02:27:46.090 --> 02:27:48.092
AT THE TEL AVIV IS CERTAINLY IN

02:27:48.159 --> 02:27:50.661
A PLACE WHERE BETWEEN THE

02:27:50.728 --> 02:27:53.397
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE CPUC

02:27:53.464 --> 02:27:54.865
THEIR CONVERSATIONS TO THE

02:27:54.932 --> 02:27:57.201
COURT AND AS YOU HEARD OF THE

02:27:57.268 --> 02:28:00.338
PRESIDENT. ARTICULATE THERE IS

02:28:00.404 --> 02:28:02.240
GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF

02:28:02.306 --> 02:28:03.841
RESOLUTION THERE WILL BE SOME

02:28:03.908 --> 02:28:05.109
FORM OF ENTITY I WOULD IMAGINE

02:28:05.176 --> 02:28:06.477
THAT EMERGES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY

02:28:06.544 --> 02:28:10.014
THAT WILL PROVIDE POWER TO- THE

02:28:10.081 --> 02:28:12.183
SERVICE AREA WHAT AT ENTITY

02:28:12.250 --> 02:28:13.618
LOOKS LIKE AND HOW IT

02:28:13.684 --> 02:28:15.820
ULTIMATELY. IS STRUCTURED IS

02:28:15.886 --> 02:28:18.756
STILL UNDER CONVERSATIONS AND

02:28:18.823 --> 02:28:21.058
SO THERE IT IS A BUT WILL THERE

02:28:21.125 --> 02:28:24.762
BE SOME ENTITY CALLED SOME

02:28:24.829 --> 02:28:27.098
UTILITY THAT WILL PROVIDE POWER

02:28:27.164 --> 02:28:29.367
TO COST CUSTOMER BASE THAT

02:28:29.433 --> 02:28:32.436
STILL IS. IN A RISK OF HAVING

02:28:32.503 --> 02:28:35.239
QUALIFIERS- STARTED THAT NEED

02:28:35.306 --> 02:28:36.774
TO STILL PARTICIPATE IN A FUND

02:28:36.841 --> 02:28:38.009
OF SOME SORT I THINK THAT THERE

02:28:38.075 --> 02:28:40.311
WILL BE SOME KIND OF UTILITY

02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:41.979
AND THERE IS A DEADLINE THERE'S

02:28:42.046 --> 02:28:45.616
A WALL UP THERE. FOR A KNEE OR

02:28:45.683 --> 02:28:47.818
SOME. KHAN TO EMERGE TO ALLOW

02:28:47.885 --> 02:28:49.086
TO BE ABLE TO PROTEST SO I

02:28:49.153 --> 02:28:49.954
DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS AN

02:28:50.021 --> 02:28:51.489
EXPECTATION THAT THERE WOULD

02:28:51.555 --> 02:28:54.525
NOT BE A UTILITY STANDING TO BE

02:28:54.592 --> 02:28:55.526
ABLE TO AND HOPEFULLY IN A

02:28:55.593 --> 02:28:58.296
TIMELY WAY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE.

02:28:58.362 --> 02:29:00.398
OF THE FUND PARTICIPATION. SO I

02:29:00.464 --> 02:29:03.100
IT BUT I WAS CURIOUS IN TERMS

02:29:03.167 --> 02:29:03.668
OF IF NOT THAT APPROACH THAN

02:29:03.734 --> 02:29:06.704
WHAT. AND THAT'S WHERE MY

02:29:06.771 --> 02:29:09.106
CONCLUSION- WELL THAT'S WHERE I

02:29:09.173 --> 02:29:10.508
WAS COMING FROM YOU KNOW IF

02:29:10.574 --> 02:29:12.276
THERE WAS THIS DOESN'T WORK

02:29:12.343 --> 02:29:14.845
FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT WHAT

02:29:14.912 --> 02:29:15.346
WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER

02:29:15.413 --> 02:29:18.382
APPROACH. NO SIR THE ANSWER BUT

I'M JUST. THE KERR TO ME AND

02:29:21.952 --> 02:29:22.486

EFFICIENCY RENEWABLE

02:30:32.223 --> 02:30:33.591
TECHNOLOGIES SUCH WE'RE

02:30:33.657 --> 02:30:35.126
GRATEFUL FOR THIS FORM OF

02:30:35.192 --> 02:30:36.727
OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN THE

02:30:36.794 --> 02:30:38.362
DEBATE I HAD A BOARD MEETING.

02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:39.730
GOING ON IT JUST FINISHED SO I

02:30:39.797 --> 02:30:41.499
WASN'T ABLE TO COME BUT I HAD

02:30:41.565 --> 02:30:43.234
SOMEBODY LISTENING AND SO.

02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:45.836

HER PRESENCE- BUT THERE'S A LOT

02:30:51.242 --> 02:30:52.009
OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

02:30:52.076 --> 02:30:54.545
AT THE PC- I WAS PARTICULARLY

02:30:54.612 --> 02:30:57.081
TAKEN BY- ED RENDELL'S COMMENTS

02:30:57.148 --> 02:30:59.183
THAT THERE'S NO PLAN B. FOR THE

02:30:59.250 --> 02:31:02.153
OTC. EXTENSIONS AND FRANKLY

02:31:02.219 --> 02:31:04.789
THAT'S ON THE PC THAT HAD NINE

02:31:04.855 --> 02:31:06.690
YEARS TO PREPARE. FOR THE

02:31:06.757 --> 02:31:08.526
EVENTUALITY. THE OFFICES WERE

02:31:08.592 --> 02:31:10.194
MADE TO THE COMMUNITIES WHERE

02:31:10.261 --> 02:31:12.363
THESE PLANTS ARE BUILT- AND NOW

02:31:12.430 --> 02:31:13.564
WE'RE KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE

02:31:13.631 --> 02:31:14.832
ROAD AND WE DON'T HAVE A

02:31:14.899 --> 02:31:16.500
PLAUSIBLE PLAN. FOR WHAT

02:31:16.567 --> 02:31:18.135
HAPPENS WHEN THOSE EXTENSIONS

02:31:18.202 --> 02:31:19.737
ROVERS SO THAT'S THE FIRST

02:31:19.804 --> 02:31:20.838
THING. THIS IS A PROBLEM THESE

02:31:20.905 --> 02:31:21.939
ARE THE DIRTIEST LEAST

02:31:22.006 --> 02:31:25.075
EFFICIENT MOST EXPENSIVE UNITS

02:31:25.142 --> 02:31:26.610
ON ASSIST. AND THEY WERE

02:31:26.677 --> 02:31:28.446
SUPPOSED TO BE RETIRED. BASED

02:31:28.512 --> 02:31:29.480
ON THIS IS NINE YEARS AGO

02:31:29.547 --> 02:31:31.081
SECONDLY WE ARE MISSING THE

02:31:31.148 --> 02:31:34.051
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE NECESSARY

02:31:34.118 --> 02:31:35.820
PROCUREMENT THIS IS WHY WE HAVE

02:31:35.886 --> 02:31:38.055
THIS CRISIS IS THAT WE HAVE

02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:38.956
BEEN SITTING ON THE ISSUE OF

02:31:39.023 --> 02:31:41.292
PROCUREMENT- THERE'S CHALLENGES

02:31:41.358 --> 02:31:42.960
WITH THE RISE OF THE CCA'S AND

02:31:43.027 --> 02:31:44.295
SO FORTH BUT- THE OTHER THING

02:31:44.361 --> 02:31:46.397
WE HAVE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:31:46.464 --> 02:31:48.299
USE CREATIVE. A NEW

02:31:48.365 --> 02:31:50.301
TECHNOLOGIES DEMAND RESPONSE

02:31:50.367 --> 02:31:53.103
STORAGE HYBRID RESOURCES AND

02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:55.372
UNFORTUNATELY THE PC IGNORE THE

02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:56.273
RECOMMENDATIONS OF SOUTHERN

02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:58.008
CALIFORNIA EDISON A CAL I SO

02:31:58.075 --> 02:32:00.311
AND US ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE TO

02:32:00.377 --> 02:32:02.713
ADOPT APPROPRIATE IN ACCOUNTING

02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:04.048
RULES AND INSTEAD THEY WENT

02:32:04.114 --> 02:32:05.082
WITH THE MOST RESTRICTIVE RULES

02:32:05.149 --> 02:32:06.817
ANYBODY HAD PROPOSED WHICH WE

02:32:06.884 --> 02:32:08.118
THINK IS GOING TO ENSURE THAT

02:32:08.185 --> 02:32:09.420
THE UPCOMING PROCUREMENT WON'T

02:32:09.487 --> 02:32:11.222

RESOURCES AS WELL AS WE COULD

02:32:15.392 --> 02:32:16.961
HAVE SO WE THINK THERE'S MUCH

02:32:17.027 --> 02:32:18.429
WORK TO BE DONE WE THINK THE

02:32:18.496 --> 02:32:20.498
PROCESS HAS A LOT OF

02:32:20.564 --> 02:32:21.932
IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED WE
