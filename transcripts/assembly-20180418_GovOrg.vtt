UP FROM LA. AS A RESULT HE WAS

00:34:53.158 --> 00:34:57.295 region:rollup2
UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE HE COULD

00:34:55.627 --> 00:34:58.964 region:rollup2
HAVE CALLED THE END BUT BAGLEY

00:34:57.295 --> 00:35:00.498 region:rollup2
KEENE DOES NOT PERMIT THAT.

00:34:58.964 --> 00:35:02.267 region:rollup2
ON ANOTHER CASE I WAS QUITE

THIS IS A GOOD START FIRST

00:35:36.234 --> 00:35:41.906 region:rollup2
START.

AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT.

00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:37.962 region:rollup2
BUT WE WE DON'T SEE ANY REASON

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:39.164 region:rollup2
WHY ADVISORY COMMITTEES SHOULD

00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:40.665 region:rollup2

DO.

00:37:25.877 --> 00:37:29.013 region:rollup2
WHEN THE TELECONFERENCE

PROVISION WAS WRITTEN.

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:33.218 region:rollup2
DECADES AGO.

00:37:30.749 --> 00:37:34.886 region:rollup2
IT WAS DONE SO IN ON.

00:37:33.218 --> 00:37:36.454 region:rollup2
WITH THE PURPOSE OF ALLOWING

00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:38.423 region:rollup2

NOT MISS MEETINGS AND FOR THE

00:37:39.891 --> 00:37:44.562 region:rollup2
BODY TO ACTUALLY DO ITS WORK.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.164 region:rollup2
FOR SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT

.

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:54.005 region:rollup2
I MEAN BIG THE UNLESS THEY

00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:56.007 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY MET IN ONE LOCATION

00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:57.342 region:rollup2
ARE NONE OF THOSE BODIES COULD

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:58.910 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GET ANY WORK DONE SO

00:37:57.342 --> 00:38:02.013 region:rollup2
THE TELECONFERENCING PROVISION

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:03.715 region:rollup2
WAS INTRODUCED AS A CONCEPT.

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:05.283 region:rollup2
WELL BUT IN DOING SO ALSO

00:38:03.715 --> 00:38:07.252 region:rollup2
BALANCED BLUE ABILITY OF THE

00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:10.121 region:rollup2
PUBLIC TO ACCESS NOT ONLY THE

00:38:07.252 --> 00:38:11.856 region:rollup2

WERE LOCATED.

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:23.735 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT STILL THE BEST

00:38:21.533 --> 00:38:25.703 region:rollup2
WAY FOR ON THE PUBLIC TO

00:38:23.735 --> 00:38:27.505 region:rollup2

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:29.174 region:rollup2

PROVIDING INTERNET ACCESS.

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:35.213 region:rollup2
REQUIRING A QUORUM TO BE.

00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:36.948 region:rollup2
OUR PRESENT IN A PHYSICAL

00:38:35.213 --> 00:38:39.217 region:rollup2
LOCATION OF THOSE ARE GREAT

00:38:36.948 --> 00:38:40.718 region:rollup2
IDEAS BUT I'LL NOT AT THE

00:38:39.217 --> 00:38:42.987 region:rollup2
EXPENSE OF UNDERMINING SOME OF

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:44.856 region:rollup2
THE EARLIER. UP PROVISIONS THAT

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:46.558 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN IN THE BILL'S ARM AND

00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:49.994 region:rollup2
FOR THAT REASON.

00:38:46.558 --> 00:38:51.729 region:rollup2
WE RESPECTFULLY URGENT NO VOTE.

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:54.365 region:rollup2

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:23.795 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES ITSELF SOMETHING

00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:24.729 region:rollup2

A LOT BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN

COME IN USING MODERN TECHNOLOGY

00:48:21.499 --> 00:48:24.802 region:rollup2
I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING THE

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.737 region:rollup2
RATIONALE WHY SOMEONE WILL

00:48:24.802 --> 00:48:28.272 region:rollup2

IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THAT IS.

00:48:49.493 --> 00:48:51.428 region:rollup2
YOUR COMMENTS IS GOING A LITTLE

00:48:50.428 --> 00:48:56.567 region:rollup2
BIT.

00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:57.668 region:rollup2
.

00:48:56.567 --> 00:48:58.269 region:rollup2

OKAY.

00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:25.629 region:rollup2
MORE TECHNOLOGY IS MUCH BETTER

00:49:25.095 --> 00:49:27.298 region:rollup2
WE AGREE WITH ALL OF THOSE

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:28.966 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:31.535 region:rollup2
WE JUST DON'T LIKE TO SEE THAT

00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:32.570 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AT THE EXPENSE OF SOME OF

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:35.005 region:rollup2
THE PROVISIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:36.474 region:rollup2
BEEN IN THE LAW THAT DO ALLOW

00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:38.242 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE UNDER

00:49:36.474 --> 00:49:39.977 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW. BY

THE.

00:49:46.684 --> 00:49:50.588 region:rollup2
LACK OF ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:53.157 region:rollup2
TO BE LOCATED AT THE LOCATION

00:49:50.588 --> 00:49:54.792 region:rollup2
WHERE MEMBERS PARTICIPATING

00:49:53.157 --> 00:49:55.926 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE ELIMINATED.

00:49:54.792 --> 00:49:57.394 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE ADDING

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:58.796 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TO IT NOW I DOUBT

00:49:57.394 --> 00:50:01.232 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ANYBODY

00:49:58.796 --> 00:50:03.400 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING FROM IRAQ.

00:50:01.232 --> 00:50:05.169 region:rollup2
BUT THEY MIGHT BE IN THE SAME

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.903 region:rollup2
LOCATION WHERE A MEMBER IS

00:50:05.169 --> 00:50:07.805 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING WHEN THEY'RE ON

00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:10.007 region:rollup2
BUSINESS.

00:50:07.805 --> 00:50:11.742 region:rollup2
AND THEY SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE

00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:12.877 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:14.845 region:rollup2
AT THAT LOCATION WHICH CURRENT

00:50:12.877 --> 00:50:17.047 region:rollup2
LAW PROVIDS.

00:50:25.623 --> 00:50:27.558 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THE

00:50:27.091 --> 00:50:28.492 region:rollup2

TECHNOLOGY.

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:31.462 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE OF THE LOCATION WAS

00:50:30.928 --> 00:50:32.196 region:rollup2
IN FACT THAT THERE WASN'T

00:50:31.462 --> 00:50:32.830 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES

00:50:32.196 --> 00:50:34.932 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WOULD NEED TO GO TO THAT

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:35.599 region:rollup2
LOOK.

00:50:34.932 --> 00:50:36.467 region:rollup2
WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:39.537 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S NO LONGER THE

00:50:36.467 --> 00:50:40.537 region:rollup2
CASE AND THEREFORE APPROPRIATE.

00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:41.305 region:rollup2
FOR SOME REFORM.

00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:43.707 region:rollup2

THE BILL'S REQUIREMENTS ARE

00:58:41.952 --> 00:58:44.988 region:rollup2
MODEST IN COST TO THE STATE BUT

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:46.790 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL IN IMPACT

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:48.125 region:rollup2
SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN LOS ANGELES

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.993 region:rollup2

IMPROVING THE RESILIENCE OF

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:56.500 region:rollup2
THOSE COMMUNITIES INCREASING

00:58:55.532 --> 00:58:58.468 region:rollup2
THEIR PROPERTIES VALUE AND

00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:59.669 region:rollup2
DECREASING THEIR RISKS.

00:58:58.468 --> 00:59:01.271 region:rollup2
I MIGHT JUST ADD THAT ON MY WAY

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:02.439 region:rollup2
UP FROM THE PENINSULA TODAY I

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:03.306 region:rollup2
STOPPED OFF ON A CITY IN THE

ONE WAS A COMMUNITY CENTER IN

WHICH DOZENS OF CHILDREN RESIDE

00:59:12.249 --> 00:59:15.719 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY AND WHICH WILL BE

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:18.321 region:rollup2
COUNTED ON TO BE A.

00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:19.756 region:rollup2
SHELTER AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE

00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:21.091 region:rollup2
THE OTHER WAS THE DISPATCH

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:23.260 region:rollup2
CENTER BASICALLY THE NINE ELEVEN

00:59:21.091 --> 00:59:24.961 region:rollup2
CALL CENTER FOR FIRE AND AND

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:26.897 region:rollup2
POLICE A BUILDING THAT'S GOING

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:28.131 region:rollup2
TO BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE

00:59:26.897 --> 00:59:29.466 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE OF THAT CITY AFTER

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:30.500 region:rollup2
AN EARTHQUAKE.

00:59:29.466 --> 00:59:32.702 region:rollup2
TURNS OUT BOTH OF THOSE

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:34.304 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS WERE OLDER CONCRETE

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:35.839 region:rollup2
BLOCK BUILDINGS WITH WOOD ROOFS

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:37.307 region:rollup2
PRECISELY THE TYPE OF BUILDINGS

00:59:35.839 --> 00:59:39.576 region:rollup2
THAT NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED IN

00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:41.511 region:rollup2
THIS BILL. TO MADE ALL MORE

00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:43.513 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:44.081 region:rollup2
RESILIENCE OF THE CITY'S IS

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:45.849 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY THIS

00:59:44.081 --> 00:59:46.683 region:rollup2
BILL.

00:59:45.849 --> 00:59:48.151 region:rollup2
MANY OF OUR STATES MOST

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:49.052 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS LIVE IN

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:50.787 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS THAT ARE THREATENED

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:51.922 region:rollup2
SELVES HIGHLY VULNERABLE.

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:53.423 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A

00:59:51.922 --> 00:59:54.758 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CONCERN MORE THAN

00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:55.592 region:rollup2
FORTY NINE THOUSAND APARTMENT

00:59:54.758 --> 00:59:56.860 region:rollup2

UNINHABITABLE FOLLOWING THE

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.596 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR NORTHRIDGE

00:59:57.894 --> 01:00:01.164 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKE.

00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:02.599 region:rollup2
AT A TIME WHEN OUR LEGISLATURE

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:03.934 region:rollup2
IS CONSIDERING NEW WAYS TO ADD

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:05.969 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:07.904 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE. WE BELIEVE IT IS

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:08.939 region:rollup2
EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO WORK TOWARD

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:10.640 region:rollup2
PROTECTING THE HOUSING WE

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.042 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.677 region:rollup2
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE ENGINE

01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:15.612 region:rollup2
OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY YET

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:16.880 region:rollup2
MANY ARE ALSO AT RISK AB TWENTY

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.548 region:rollup2
SIX EIGHTY ONE WILL PROVIDE

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.350 region:rollup2
VITAL INFORMATION TO BUSINESS

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:21.818 region:rollup2
OWNERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:23.653 region:rollup2
TO USE IN DEVELOPING INCENTIVE

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:25.155 region:rollup2

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:26.790 region:rollup2
RESTORE FUNCTIONALITY.

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:28.692 region:rollup2
AND PER SERVE JOBS AFTER ANOTHER

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:30.827 region:rollup2
MAJOR SEISMIC EVENT THIS IS THE

IN TERMS OF RESILIENCY.

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:24.981 region:rollup2
DID A SIX MONTH STUDY OF THE

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.616 region:rollup2
CITY OF BOSTON.

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:28.418 region:rollup2
DOING DEVELOPING A CASE STUDY

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:29.886 region:rollup2
ON RESILIENCY IN BOSTON WE

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:31.288 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN

TERMSA HORIZONTAL VERTICAL

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:34.424 region:rollup2
INFASTRUCTURE. BUT WE ALSO

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:35.992 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THINGS IN TERMS OF THE

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:37.561 region:rollup2
HUMAN ASPECTS

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:39.329 region:rollup2

FORTH.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.135 region:rollup2
WHAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:47.170 region:rollup2
WE LEARNED IN LOOKING AT

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:48.471 region:rollup2
RESILIENCY IS THAT IS THE HUMAN

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:49.873 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS IN THE RESILIENCY THE

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:51.374 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT DETERMINE WHETHER

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:53.810 region:rollup2
DOT THE CITY OF BUILDING A

BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE

01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:56.713 region:rollup2
RESILIENT.

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:59.349 region:rollup2
I SECOND THE COMMENTS THAT WERE

01:01:56.713 --> 01:02:00.650 region:rollup2
MADE. I JUST BEFORE ME AND THAT

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:01.952 region:rollup2
WE ALSO LEARNED THAT.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.320 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:04.754 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.790 region:rollup2
THE MOST DISADVANTAGED OF THOSE

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:08.091 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE. LEAST ABLE AND

01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:09.593 region:rollup2
LEAST LIKELY TO BE A RECOVER

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:10.961 region:rollup2
FROM MAJOR DISASTERS

01:02:09.593 --> 01:02:13.096 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF BOSTON THAT WAS

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:14.531 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY. THINGS SUCH AS

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:15.865 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE WHETHER ISSUES

01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:17.767 region:rollup2
HURRICANES

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:18.401 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY TERRORISM. AND

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:20.203 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IT'S REALLY

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:22.572 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKES.

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:23.840 region:rollup2
AND IF WE HAD THE MAJOR WE WILL

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:25.442 region:rollup2
HAVE THE MAJOR EARTHQUAKE

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.110 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY THE KIND OF DISASTER

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:29.145 region:rollup2
SOCIAL EIGHT THAT. IS REALLY

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:31.214 region:rollup2
TERRIFYING IS NOT JUST THE HUMAN

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:32.916 region:rollup2
LOSS OF LIFE THAT WILL CURB WE

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.683 region:rollup2
DON'T GET AND DO SOMETHING

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:35.652 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC SOON.

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:37.320 region:rollup2
IT IS ALSO THE ECONOMIC AND

01:02:35.652 --> 01:02:38.855 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHE THE

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.256 region:rollup2
THE QUANTITY OF RUBBLE THAT

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:42.192 region:rollup2
WOULD BE RESULT FROM THAT FROM

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:43.493 region:rollup2
STATS I'VE SEEN WOULD FILL ALL

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:45.428 region:rollup2
THE LANDFILLS CALIFORNIAN

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:46.763 region:rollup2
PROBABLY. MAJORITY LANDFILLS

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:48.531 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:49.633 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THAT

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:50.667 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HORRENDOUS

01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:52.002 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION YOU HAVE THE

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:53.269 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION THE AIR IN THE

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:54.704 region:rollup2
SOIL IN THE WALK THE RESULT FROM

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:56.539 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF EARTHQUAKE.

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:57.641 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE AN ECONOMIC SPIRAL THAT

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:58.942 region:rollup2
WOULD OCCUR BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO

01:02:57.641 --> 01:03:00.243 region:rollup2
ARE DISADVANTAGED WHO LIVE IN

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:01.945 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF HOMES WILL NOT BE

01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:03.513 region:rollup2
ABLE TO WORK LOT OF THEM. AND

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:05.115 region:rollup2
MADE THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE THE

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:06.716 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY THOSE

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:08.618 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ALSO WILL GO DOWN.

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:10.420 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS A SIX LARGER SEEK

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:11.621 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD BUT IT WILL

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.289 region:rollup2
NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THAT

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:15.191 region:rollup2
KIND OF DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THE

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:16.960 region:rollup2
