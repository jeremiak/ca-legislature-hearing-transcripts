OKAY [inaudible] SEVEN SEVEN GLAZER. HERE GLAZER HERE CHIANG CHAIN HERE [inaudible] ARCHULETA. DODD GALGIANI GALGIANI HERE HELL. LEYVA. PAN. CAN HEAR WILK. WELL HERE. WE HAVE A A QUORUM AND WE HAVE -- Và WILL BEGIN WE HAVE ONE BILL ON OUR AGENDA THIS MORNING SB SIXTY SEVEN BY SENATOR MCGUIRE SENATOR WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR FLOORS YOURS THANK YOU SO MUCH I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR WHO. HAS REALLY TAKEN A DEEP DIVE ON THIS ISSUE -- IN VERY GRATEFUL FOR OFFICE WORK ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE -- MISS HUCKLE ON THE COMMITTEE STAFF TEAMED UP FOR ALL OF HER ONCE AS WELL BUT I'M JUST SO GRATEFUL MISTER CHAIR FOR ALL OF YOUR EFFORTS -- WITH THIS ISSUE. MEMBERS BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. THIS BILL IS GOING TO PROTECT THOUSANDS OF CANVAS FARMERS IN PARTICULAR. WHO DID THE RIGHT THING AND APPLIED FOR STATE LICENSE? AFTER THE PASSAGE OF PROP. SIXTY FOUR I'D THE TEMPORARY LICENSE IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE. IN BECAUSE THE INABILITY TO BE ABLE TO EXTEND THEIR LICENSE DUE TO EXISTING STATE LAW. WHICH MEANS. THESE FOLKS ARE ALL GOING TO BE ABLE ARE ALL GONNA DROP INTO THE ILLICIT BLACK MARKET. THEIR IN ESTIMATED TEN THOUSAND TEMPORARY LICENSES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT WILL EXPIRE. TWENTY THREE TODAY TWENTY THREE TODAY WILL GO FROM LEGAL TO ELICIT. AT NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. THIS IS THE WORST WAY TO TRANSITION A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR AGRICULTURAL CROP WHICH EMPLOYS THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. WITHOUT LEGAL LICENSES THERE ISN'T A LEGAL REGULATED MARKET. IN CALIFORNIA WOULD LIKE TO GO TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE AS THE CHAIR DID -- OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS. UNTIL THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE STATE'S LICENSING AUTHORITIES WERE ABLE TO ISSUE FOUR MONTH TEMPORARY LICENSES TO APPLICANTS. WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXTENSION. THE TEMPORARY LICENSES REQUIRED PROOF OF LOCAL AUTHORIZATION AND ENTITLE LICENSE HOLDERS TO GAUGE IN COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY WITHOUT COMPLETING THE MANDATED ANNUAL LICENSING APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING SEEKER REVIEW [inaudible] THAT'S AMENDED. BUT TO BE A TO GET HIM IN THE SYSTEM. THERE IS AN EXCEPTION MADE RIGHT THING TO DO. TO BUY MORE TIME FOR THE LOCALS CONDUCTS SEEK REVIEWS THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR PASSED SB FOURTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH AUTHORIZED A LICENSING AUTHORITY STATE AGENCY FOR EXAMPLE TO ISSUE A PROVISIONAL LICENSE TO AN APPLICANT. IF THE APPLICANT HOLDS A TEMPER LICENSE NUMBER ONE DEMONSTRATED SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH SEEK WHAT NUMBER TWO AND WHILE LOCAL REVIEW WAS STILL CARRYING. THE APPLICANT COMPLETED ALL OTHER PORTIONS OF THE APPLICATION. BUT TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT HERE JUST BECAUSE OF SICK WHAT REVIEW OR TRYING TO G. SEQUEL COMPLAINTS. WERE HERE BECAUSE STATE DEPARTMENTS BEEN PROCESSING THE TEN THOUSAND TEMPORARY LICENSES QUICKLY ENOUGH. IN THIS IS CONFUSING ANGLER THROW UP A QUICK CHART MISTER CHAIR IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU. SO ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND TEMPORARY LICENSES. SYDNEY TEN THOUSAND LICENSES TOTAL. YOUR TEMPORARY LICENSE TO FIND A IN ORGANIC CANNABIS FARMER. I HAVE A TEMPER LICENSE FOR A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. AND THEN I CAN GET A NINETY DAY EXTENSION. BUT PER STATE LAW THAT NINETY DAY EXTENSION CANNOT BE ISSUED PAST DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO THE DEPARTMENTS ISSUED A LOT OF EXTENSIONS. OVER SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED WERE ISSUED BY THE CALVET APARTMENT OF FOOD NAG ALONE. THE SECOND STEP AS FAR AS LIKE THE SCENE S A PROVISIONAL LICENSE. IT'S VALID FOR ONE YEAR. OUT OF THE SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THAT WERE SENT TO CDFA. ONLY FOR PROVISIONAL LICENSES FOR HAVE BEEN ISSUED. FUNDING TO JUMP DOWN ALL THE WAY TO ANNUAL LICENSES. FIVE IN ANNUAL LICENSE THAT MEANS I AM FREE AND CLEAR TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE -- MY CANNABIS FARM FOR EXAMPLE. OUT OF ALL DEPARTMENTS IS WELL AS CDFA. ONLY FIFTY TO FIFTY TWO ANNUAL LICENSES. HAVE BEEN ISSUED. ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS. SO -- YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A SEEK WHAT COMPLIANCE ISSUE. AND THE MONTH OF MARCH ALONE OVER ONE THOUSAND TEMPORARY GROWING LICENCES ISSUED BY CD. COVER DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG ARE SET TO EXPIRE. THE STATE UNDER CURRENT LAW HAS NO ABILITY AS WE JUST SAW TO EXTEND A TEMPORARY LICENSE DESPITE THE FACT THOUSANDS ARE SET TO EXPIRE. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THOUSANDS OF APPLICANTS WHO WANTED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW IN APPLIED FOR TEMPORARY LICENSE DID SO IN THE LAST QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN LEAVING A MASSIVE BACKLOG FOR THE STATE REGULATING AGENCIES. TO BE CLEAR. WE GAVE ALL THESE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO BE A TO COME IN FOR TEMPORARY LICENSE UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TO BE ABLE TO APPLY. AS A TEMPORARY LICENSE IS COME DO IF THE STATE CAN'T APPROVE OR DENY AN ANNUAL LICENSE PRIOR TO TEMPER LICENSE EXPIRING THE LICENSE HOLDER FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M A FARMER DISTRIBUTOR RETAILER. WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO OPERATE LEGALLY AND WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY KICKED BACK INTO THE BLACK MARKET. THIS ALSO MEANS THE FLOW LEGAL CANNABIS IS AT RISK TO RETAILERS WHICH VERY WELL COULD MEAN. ENHANCE RELIANCE. ON BLACK MARKET CANNABIS AT THE RETAIL LEVEL. THE EXACT ISSUE. WE WANT TO AVOID. WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT CREATING THE ENTIRE LEGAL STRUCTURE FOR A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CANNABIS MARKET IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA WAS LIKE BUILDING AN AIRPLANE WHILE WE'RE FLYING IN. AND THAT'S WHEN THE REASONS WHY WE'RE HERE IN MY WE WERE WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM WOOD. TO BUILD INTERVIEWS SB SIXTY SEVEN WHICH DOES IT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE BEER OF CANNABIS CONTROL TO EXTEND TEMPORARY LICENCES BY LICENSEES WHETHER A NEW APPLICATION IS BEING PROCESS. SO AS LONG AS THE ANNUAL APPLICATION WAS IN BEFORE THE TIMBER EXPIRED. THE EXTENSION OF THIRTY WILL EXPIRE ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. NUMBER. TWO SB SIXTY SEVEN IMPROVES THE PROVISIONAL ANNUAL LICENSE PROCESS IN THE STATE IT CLARIFIES THAT IF IT'S WITHIN THE STATE AGENCIES SOLE DISCRETION THEY CAN CONVERT A TEMPORARY LICENSE. TO A PROVISIONAL ANNUAL. IT ALLOWS LICENSING AUTHORITIES ARE GRANT PROVISIONAL LICENSE IS TO LOW'S WITHOUT TEMPORARY LICENSES ONCE THE BACKLOG OF APPLICATIONS FOR THOSE WITH TEMPER LICENSES IS RESOLVED FINALLY. ON PROVISIONALS IT EXTENDS PROVISIONAL LICENSES TO JULY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY OF THE CURRENT JANUARY FIRST INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT GENERATION FIRST -- JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY EXPIRATION. FINALLY AND I'M GONNA STOP TALKING MISTER CHAIR -- SB SIXTY SEVEN REQUIRES ANY LICENSING AUTHORITIES STATE DEPARTMENT WHO USES THE EXTENSION OF STORY TO PROVIDE CERTAIN METRICS THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE TO BE TRACKING THIS. HOW MANY TEMPORARY LICENSES LICENSEES HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND YOUR APPLICATIONS HOW MANY HAVE NOT BEEN HOW ME TEMPORARY LICENSES HAVE EXPIRED? IN THIS ALL HAS TO GO TO THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW THE PROVISIONAL ANNUAL APPLICATIONS ARE BEING PROCESS. TO BE CLEAR SB SIXTY SEVEN CREATES A SHORT TERM SOLUTION TO AVOID AN IMPENDING CRISIS THAT IS CURRENTLY AT OUR DOORSTEP NOW. AND SET UP ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS THIS YEAR HALFWAY FOR CREATING A THRIVING GREEN MARKET PLACE FOR THE GOLDEN STATE AND THAT IS REALLY WHERE THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO. IS. THIS IS A BANDAID. TO A BIG CHALLENGE BUT IT BUYS US BREATHING ROOM. FOR A BIG FIX. TO HAVE TODAY A TERROR CARVER HERE EXACTLY DIRECTOR WITH THE HUMBLE COUNTY GROWERS ASSOCIATION WHO WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET BACK BECAUSE OF FLOODED ROADWAYS -- IN LINDSAY ROBINSON EXACTLY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION TO BE TO PROVIDE COMING IN AGAIN MISTER CHAIR GONNA SAY SINCERELY THANK YOU.

THANK YOU SENATORS -- GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TERRA CARVER AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE HUMBLE COUNTY GROWERS LANCE REPRESENTING OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY LICENSED CANNABIS BUSINESSES WORKING IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. SIXTY SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN HUMBOLDT COUNTY PASSED THE FIRST LAND USE ORDINANCE REGULATING COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WILL HUMBOLDT COUNTY REPRESENTS JUST A FRACTION OF 1% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION HUMBLE HOLDS CULTIVATION LICENSES REPRESENTING OVER SEVEN HUNDRED INDEPENDENT BSINESSES. WHILE WE ARE SMALL IN POPULATION WERE PRETTY MIGHTY WHEN IT COMES TO CANNABIS FARMING AND WE'RE ON TO AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP WITH OVER FIFTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.% AS EARLY AS THE DOCTORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FARMERS AND% HUMBOLDT OR THE FIRST TO STEP FORWARD AND COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS. DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT DETECTS AS A RESULT THESE BUSINESSES OF SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS. WORKING WITH THE COUNTY AND STATE AGENCIES TO DO JUST THAT. WHILE ADAPTING TO AN EVER CHANGING ARE CHANGING REGULATORY CLIMATE. MANY OF THE BUSINESSES TEMPORARY LICENSES ARE SET TO EXPIRE IN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO A FEW ALREADY HAVE RENDERING THEM UNABLE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. WHAT WE BELIEVE WITHOUT THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL THERE WILL BE DIRE CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS ANIMATE MARKET COLLAPSE? OF HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSES WITHIN THE REGION AND THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE STATE. THE WHOLE COUNTY GORE'S LANDS WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR MCGUIRE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD IN AG AND THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT TO OUR COMMUNITY. AND AGREEING TO TAKE ON THIS ISSUE IN HERE THIS CRITICAL BILL TODAY. WERE SINCERELY APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO THIS POLICY CONTAINED IN SB SIXTY SEVEN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO SEE THIS BILL APPROVED AND SIGNED INTO LAW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IN YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL THANK. THANK YOU NEXT NEXT WITNESS HI GOOD MORNING I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING A LITTLE TARDY WE WERE HOSTING -- WEAPON ARE WITH THE BEER OF CANNABIS CONTROL AND I RAN A LITTLE LATE -- GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS LINDSAY ROBINSON AND I'M THE EXACT DESTRY ASSOCIATION. CCI A AS WERE ALSO KNOWN WAS FORMED IN TWENTY TWELVE TO UNITE THE CAN'T ILLEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY. TO HELP EDUCATE AND ACT AS A RESOURCE TO LAWMAKERS AND OUR MEMBERS. WERE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL TRADE ASSOCIATION IN THE STATE REPRESENTING THE DIVIDE THE DIVERSE INTERESTS OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY INCLUDING RETAIL CULTIVATION MANUFACTURING DELIVERY DISTRIBUTION. CASTING INSURANCE PACKAGING AND VARIOUS ANCILLARY SERVICES ARE UNIFIED VOICE INCLUDES OVER FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES REPRESENTING SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BRANDS AND NEARLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THROUGHOUT THE TATE. C. C. I. A. IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL SIXTY SEVEN AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. SB SIXTY SEVEN ALLOWS THE CANNABIS AND CANNABIS BUSINESSES THAT WERE ISSUED TEMPORARY CANNABIS BUSINESS LICENSES PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN TO REMAIN OPERABLE UNTIL THE STATE LICENSING AGENCIES PROCESS ANNUAL APPLICATIONS. THIS TEMPORARY LICENSE PROGRAM WHICH WAS ENACTED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS ESTABLISHED TO ALLOW CANNABIS BUSINESSES TO OPERATE WHILE THE STATE LICENSING AGENCIES DEVELOP PROCESS AND REVIEW. APPLICATIONS FOR ANNUAL LICENSES. LAST YEAR WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE TEMPORARY STRUCTURE IT WOULD IT WOULD EXPIRE BEFORE MANY OF THE ANNUAL APPLICATIONS WERE REVIEWED AND ADDITIONAL PROVISIONAL LICENSE CATEGORY WAS CREATED TO PASS BE. FOURTEEN FIFTY NINE TO GIVE LICENSING AUTHORITIES AND THE INDUSTRY ADDITIONAL TIME TO COMPLETE THIS PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THE CREATION OF PROVISIONAL LICENSES CURRENT DATA SHOWS THAT UNLESS ADDRESSED. NEARLY SO -- SIXTY TWO HUNDRED TEMPORARY LICENSES WITH ASIANS COULD EXPIRE BY APRIL OF THIS YEAR. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE PROVIDE PATHWAYS TO KEEP COMPLIANT BUSINESSES WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING WITHIN THE LEGAL SYSTEM. BUSINESSES AND POSSESSION OF TEMPORARY LICENSES HAVE WORKED EXTREMELY HARD TO OBTAIN LOCAL APPROVAL THEY HAVE INVESTED HUNDREDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO MEET THE RIGOROUS STATE. COMPLIANCE STANDARDS WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT ALLOW THESE BUSINESSES TO FALL OUT OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM FOR NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. FURTHER DATA HAS SHOWN THAT MANY OF THE SOON TO EXPIRE LICENSES BELONG TO CULTIVATORS AS TERROR JUST ILLUMINATED. THE ESSENTIAL STARTING POINT OF THE CANNABIS SUPPLY CHAIN SHOULD THESE BUSINESSES LAPSE IN THE UPSTREAM RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE ENTIRE CANNABIS INDUSTRY COULD BE SEVERE. THE PASSAGE OF SIXTY SEVEN IS CRITICAL FOR THE CONTINUED SURVIVAL OF THE LEADERS CAN A LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF OUR C. C. I. A. MEMBERS HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO OBTAIN LYSONS AND BECOME COMPLAIN OPERATORS IN THE CANNABIS SPACE. AND THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN DANGER OF FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS WE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHENING THE ILLICIT MARKET IF WE DO NOT TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO CURB THIS PROBLEM. FOR THESE REASONS I ASK YOU PLEASE SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO LOOK INTO THIS MATTER.

NINE LIKE TO ASK ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO COME FORWARD. ALL RIGHTS SEE NOW GONNA CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. A CENTER OF WIRE FIRST LET ME SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS SPACE FOR QUITE SOME TIME -- EVEN OUT THERE -- AS A FORCEFUL ADVOCATE FOR HOW WE CAN SET UP A FAIR AND HONEST AND RESPONSIVE -- REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS -- THIS PRODUCT AND DIED AND YOU LEADERSHIP APPRECIATED BY ALL -- I DID THAT NOTICE THAT WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AG IS THERE ANYONE HERE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD IN AG. IN THE ROOM. I DID THAT MAKE A REQUEST EARLIER -- TODAY TO ASK THAT A REPRESENTATIVE FROM FOOD NAG GOT BE PRESENT SENATOR REQUIRED YOU KNOW DO THEY HAVE A POSITION ON YOUR BILL. THEY'VE NOT TAKEN A POSITION. SO IT SEEMS THAT -- AND IS THIS BILL SPONSORED BY FOOD DAGEN ANYWAY THE APPROACH YOU AND ASK YOU TO CARRY THIS LEGISLATION THEY DID NOT. THIS IS AN AUTHORED SPONSORED BILL YOU SEEN A PROBLEM. A TRAIN CRASH COMING AND AND YOU STEPPED UP TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO AVOID IT. IN OUR OFFICE WE'D CALL THIS A GOOD OLD FASHIONED HOT MESS. THAT -- THAT COULD ANSWER ANY MORE DETAILS ON THAT EXCLAMATION [inaudible] BUT OF FOOD IN AG IS. HAS A BIG PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LICENSING -- CANNABIS CULTIVATORS. THIS IS NOT A NEW THING FOR THEM RIGHT ON THE MEDICINAL SIDE THEY HAVE ALSO HAD THIS RESPONSIBILITY IN THE PAST IS THAT RIGHT. EVEN ACTIVELY ENGAGE ON MEDICINAL SIDE WITH THE PASSAGE OF MAKARSKA A FEW YEARS BACK BY THE LEGISLATURE AND WE'VE ALSO KNOWN THAT THAT THIS DAY WAS COMING FOR QUITE SOME TIME. RIGHT SO IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S OF A POINT OF BAFFLEMENT FOR FOR ME AT LEAST IS THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENED YESTERDAY -- THE LEGISLATURE IN THEIR WISDOM -- TRY DO ANTICIPATE THIS PROBLEM AND AND PROVIDED -- DISABILITY TO HAVE TEMPORARY LICENSES SO -- THE PIPELINE WAS PRETTY CLEAR FOR AWHILE IN TERMS OF THEIR NEED TO THE PROCESS WITHIN CERTAIN PERIODS OF TIME HAVE THEY GIVEN YOU AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY -- THEY'VE HAD SUCH TROUBLE. WE HAVE NOT HAD A CLEAR EXPLANATION AND I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE A FURTHER MEETINGS INTO THE WEEKS TO COME. ID GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. HAVE THEY ARE GIVING YOU ANY OPINIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS BILL WOULD RESOLVE THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE AND OTHERS. TERMS OF APPROPRIATELY LICENSING FOR THE FRAMEWORK. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE DEPARTMENT BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS WE ARE LEFT WITH NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE -- IF WE DO NOT PASS THIS BILL -- WE'RE GOING TO SEE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPLY WITH THE NEWLY PASSED LAW PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FALLING INTO THE ILLICIT MARKET. IN FACT THAT WE'RE TAKING TEN STEPS BACK IF WE ADVANCE THE STATUS QUO POSITION -- AND LET THESE LICENSES EXPIRE SO HAS THE DEPARTMENT GAVE ANY INDICATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO MAKE THIS MARKETPLACE LEGAL MARKETPLACE WORK. I THINK THAT -- IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL DEPARTMENTS -- THEY WANT TO BE ABLE. TO COMPLY WITH PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR I THINK -- I'LL SPEAK FOR MYSELF ON THIS. WE'VE SEEN THIS TRAIN COMING. BUT THE LIGHT KEEPS GETTING BRIGHTER. AND IT'S ABOUT TO CRASH. IN REGARDLESS OF YOUR OPINION ON CANNABIS. CALIFORNIA VOTERS SPOKE LOUD AND CLEAR. WE NOW HAVE A LEGAL MARKET PLACE. RENDON AT GO BACK. TWO SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THAT ARE CURRENTLY WAITING -- TO BE PROCESSED [inaudible] FOR FOUR HAVE BEEN ISSUED PROFESSIONALS. AND AND AGAIN THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAVE THEY INDICATED THEIR SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. I WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE DEPARTMENT -- I BELIEVE -- THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN GET THIS RESOLVED -- THIS YEAR AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND I GOTTA SAY. THAT THE CAPTAIN APARTMENT A FOOD NAG HAS BEEN WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH ON ISSUES OF CANNABIS. SINCE THE ISSUE OF EDICINAL CANNABIS WAS PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED. INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN THEY'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD TO WORK WITH THEY HAVE GREAT FOLKS. AND ON THIS ISSUE CHOICE BUT TO ACT AND I BELIEVE IF THIS LEGISLATURE DOES NOT ACT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOUSANDS THAT WILL NOW BE VULNERABLE. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT RAIDS THAT ARE CONTINUE TO HAPPEN WITH THOSE WHO ARE IN THE BLACK MARKET. SO -- EVERYONE I AWARE OF THAT DEADLINES IN THE REQUIREMENTS. YOU'VE POINTED OUT THAT -- OF THE THOUSANDS OF OF FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING TO FOLLOW THE RULES AND DO IT THE LEGAL WAY. THAT ONLY A HANDFUL. HAVE BEEN PROCESSED TO TO FULFILL THAT REQUIREMENT -- ITS THE IT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE THE DMV -- THAT WOULD THAT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD SITUATION WELL. I A I I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP -- THAT SOMEBODY'S PAYING ATTENTION AND STEPPING UP I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD IN AG IS NOT HERE -- SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH YOU AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE KNOWLEDGE IN THE DIFFICULTIES THAT THEY'VE HAD. ALTHOUGH THOSE ARE FOREIGN TO ME -- IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HOLDING UP AND WHY AND I GUESS THE BIGGER BROADER QUESTION FOR US IS A COMMITTEE. IS WHY THE THOUGHTFUL RESPONSE THAT YOU HAVE IN THIS BILL IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE LONG TERM AT A BY PROPRIOCEPTION LEGAL MARKET PLACE FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO ANSWER IT. AND THAT'S REALLY THE THE DILEMMA THAT I HAVE -- IN LOOKING AT YOUR LEGISLATION IS THAT. I IT SEEMS VERY VERY NECESSARY IN A THE THE RESOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE. AS WE GO FORWARD AND IF THE DEPARTMENTS NOT COMMUNICATING WITH US ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS HOW CAN WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT. EVEN THE BANDAID AS YOU DESCRIBE IT IS GOING TO DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE PEOPLE PROPERLY IN THE LEGAL MARKET PLACE. FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES IS THAT AS MANY THE MOVE INDICATED BY THEIR WILLINGNESS TO STEP UP AND REQUEST A LICENSE SO I THANKYOU. FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND LOOK TO MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS IDENTICAL JOHNNY -- CENTER MCGUIRE I'M NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH THE LICENSURE PROCESS WAS IT CDFA THAT CAME UP WITH THE STEPS THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED IN GIVING THE LICENSES. AS FAR AS CREATING THAT THE STEPS IN DAYS FOR TEMPORARY STEPS IN DAYS FOR PROVISIONAL YET NO THEY THEY DID NOT COME UP WITH THAT -- BUT THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ADHERE TO IT -- AND WHAT I'LL SAY IS THAT WE ARE -- WOEFULLY BEHIND IN THE PROCESSING. THERE'RE OUT AND I'LL LET THAT% THE DEPARTMENT SPEAK FROM THE CELLS ON WHY THEY BELIEVE -- WHEN THEY BELIEVE IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE BUT LOOK -- I'VE ALWAYS SAID THIS. IT'S GONNA TAKE US TEN YEARS. TO BE ABLE TO YOU SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION. FROM. IN ILLICIT MARKET. TWO A REGULATED LEGAL MARKET. I HAVE ALWAYS. SAID THAT. PROVIDING THIS STATE. ONE YEAR. TO PREPARE AFTER PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS SETTING THIS UP FOR SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THESE CHALLENGES ARE NOW HERE ON OUR PLATE AND IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE. I DON'T THINK THERE IS ONE SILVER BULLET BUT WHAT I WOULD HOPE. IS THAT. TO A FIX ON THIS. BUT THERE ARE EW THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE. TO THROW OUT NUMBER ONE WE HAVE TO GET THIS BILL PASSED SO WE DON'T HAVE FOLKS WHO WERE LEGAL NOW ENDING UP INTO THE ILLICIT MARKET. THAT THEN BY THIS TIME TO HAVE A GREATER CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY AND THE ADMINISTRATION. I WOULD HOPE THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO ADVANCE A LONG TRM FIX. ON THE BACKLOG AND HOW WE GET THESE FOLKS INTO THE ANNUAL CATEGORY. MY FINAL ITEM ON THIS -- IS. IT'S IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME THERE'S AN ENORMOUS. AMOUNT OF DEMAND DOUBLY COMPLICATED AND EXPENSIVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH. AND I RIGHT NOW TIME IS NOT ON OUR SIDE WE HAVE TO GET TO SING MOVED WHAT I'M WONDERING IS IF THE PROCESS IS EXTREMELY CUMBERSOME AND IF THAT'S A PART OF WHY. THE DELAY CERTAINLY I'M SURE RESOURCES IS PART OF IT BUDGETARY RESOURCES BUT IF IF FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE FROM THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO GO OUT TO TRAVEL OUT TO THE FACILITY. AND LOOK AT THINGS AN EXAM AND I WOULD SEE WHERE THAT WOULD CREATE A TREMENDOUS BACKLOG AND SO I'M WONDERING IF. IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY WITHIN THEIR REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO STREAMLINE AND AND SPEED UP THE PROCESS SOMEHOW OR IF THAT WAS HARD LINE IN THE BALLOT MEASURE ITSELF AND DESCRIPTIVE IN THE BALLOT MEASURE. PERHAPS IT WAS TOO PRESCRIPTIVE AND BUT ON THE OTHER HAND MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CHANGED THROUGH THEIR REGULATORY ABILITY. I'LL BE THE THE FIRST TO SAY AND I THINK THAT -- ARE TWO WITNESSES TODAY WILL BE THE RIGHT THERE WITH ME THAT-THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING PROCESS TO GET THROUGH AND IF YOU ARE A FARMER. WHO HAD BEEN FARMING ON THE LAND FOR THIRTY YEARS FOR YOUR SECOND GENERATION YOU'RE TRYING TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS OF BOTH THE COUNTY IN THE STATE? IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME SO -- WHAT I'LL SAY IS THIS FIRST WE ONLY ENGAGE WE BEING THE STATE ONCE WE GET THE NOD FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTHAS FOR SAY ON THE LICENSES? THEY THEN ENTER INTO THE STATE PROCESS -- I DO I DON'T EVER WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE DEPARTMENT. LOOKING THOUGH AT SIXTY NINE HUNDRED LICENSES AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF STAFF THAT THEY HAVE -- I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME CHALLENGES I AGAIN THAT'S JUST ME SPEAKING MY OWN EDITORIAL ON AND WOULD LOOK TO SEE IF THEY NEED IN IN IN THIS IS A AN ITEM THAT DAY CHAIR BROUGHT UP. IS DO THEY NEED ENHANCE -- BUDGET TO BE A TO GET THIS BACKLOG BURNED OFF ON IN WE WELCOME THAT DISCUSSION BUT I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS. FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENGAGE ON THIS CONVERSATION -- IN WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS THAT THIS BILL WILL BE ONE OF THE WAYS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE AT THE TABLE DEVELOPING A LONG TERM FIX. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR PAN. THE ROCHESTER REQUIRE. I SERVICE BILLS IMPORTANT BILL -- TO TOO AGAIN NOT LEAD TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE INDUSTRY -- THE GROWERS -- THESE MOVING THEM INTO THE BLACK MARKET I'D NOTE THAT THE DEADLINES IN THIS BILL MEAN THAT -- AT LEAST THOSE I'M SAYING THAT MEANS THAT IN ADDITION TO THIS BILL WHICH IS AN URGENCY BILL WE ALSO NEED TO RAISE. SO -- AND AND I. S. ALSO A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT -- SEE A FACE NOT HERE AS WELL SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IS THAT -- WELL THIS BILLS BEFORE US AND I WILL CERTAINLY BE VOTING FOR ITS AND WOOD FACT FACT MET MOVE IT -- AT APPROPRIATE TIME -- WHAT OTHER STEPS ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT WILL THAT YOU INTEND THAT WE SHOULD COMPLETE -- SO THAT BY THE TIME WE HIT DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN THE TEMPORARY LICENSE EXPIRE AND THE PROVISIONAL AYE LICENSE EXPIRES AND TWENTY TWENTY THAT WE ARE MOVING THIS BALL ALONG -- SO IT AND NOBODY YOU HAD SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THAT. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER PAN -- THE THE SENATE HAS -- GOSH. ANYA LOOKING SUCK ON THIS THREE YERS AGO DEVELOP THE CANNABIS WORKING GROUP IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY DID THE SAME -- SO [inaudible] EACH. HOUSE IS THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY HAVE. FIRED UP THE WORKING GROUP'S AGAIN ON AND WE HAVE MET -- IN BOTH AS MEMBERS AS WELL AS STAFF OF TRYING TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A LONG TERM FIX. THEIR AS BEEN THERE BEEN MULTIPLE MEETINGS IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY AS WELL AS THIS MONTH BETWEEN -- THE RESPECTED -- COUNTIES THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEE -- NUMBER STAFF ON THE SENATE SIDE AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY SIDE OF TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS A LONGER TERM FIX LOOK LIKE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED -- AND I'M NOT AT ALL TRYING TO BE COY WITH YOU IT DOCTOR PAN -- I THINK WE'RE GONNA EED A FEW MONTHS. FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LONGER TERM FIX IS GOING TO BE. AND BEING HONEST ABOUT IT WE CAN'T DEVELOP A LONGER TERM FIX WITHOUT THE ENGAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION -- I GUESS I'LL JUST MENTION THAT NIGHT AND PERHAPS A SUGGESTION -- FOR THE CHAIR WHETHER AT SOME POINT WE SHOULD THIS COMMITTEE OR THE PUBLIC COMMITTEE NEEDS TO DO AN OVERSIGHT HEARING -- WITH THE AGENCY HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. READING THAT YOURS MINE YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR PAN I HAD CONVERSATION WITH CENTER MCGUIRE EARLIER. TODAY ABOUT THAT EXACT ISSUE AND I THINK WE'RE BOTH LOOKING FORWARD TO HIS COMMITTEE AND OURS TOGETHER TRYING TO GET OUR HANDS AROUND ALL THESE ISSUES NO ONE LIKES TO BE SURPRISES I THINK WE HAVE BEEN THIS YEAR -- WITH THIS PROBLEM AS THIS BILL ADDRESSES OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS VIA CENTER ARCHULETA THANK YOU -- I CAN HELP. NEWS IN A LAW [inaudible] MEETING AT FIVE AND WORKABLE -- OR BUT WHEN THIS [inaudible] THAT -- HE BOAT POSITIVE ON THIS. ARE WE GONNA COME BACK AND EIGHT MONTHS NINE MONTHS AND SAY THAT THE TRAIN IT'S JUST NOT MOVING AS FAST AS IT SHOULD BE. HOW DO WE AVOID THAT BECAUSE I THINK BY THE URGENCY ON THIS IT IT GIVES THE FEELING THAT? WE'RE GOING TO FIND OR A SOLUTION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THE AS TO BE AN INTERNAL SITUATION. THAT -- THAT THE GROWERS AND EVERYONE ELSE ARE BUT ARE NOT AT FAULT. BUT HOW WE GONNA FIX THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE AND IT IS IT'S ENOUGH TIME. ORDER WE COME BACK SEVEN EIGHT NINE MONTHS FROM NOW ON IT'S A ONLY 20% GOTTEN THROUGH. FORTY FORTY WE WILL NOT HAVE A LONG TERM SOLUTION IF THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT ENGAGE. THE MINISTER IT'S TIME FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENGAGE IN THIS ISSUE. ARE THE ONLY WAY TO BE MY OPINION -- IN WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TRY TO LOOK AT ADMINISTRATIVE FIXES I AM NOT A BIG BELIEVER THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO BRING FOR THE BILL. TO GET A FIX ON AN ISSUE FACT THAT SHOULD BE THE LAST RESORT. BEING VERY HONEST WITH THE CHAIR IN THIS COMMITTEE. UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT WE NEED THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE. TO DEVELOP A LONG TERM FIX COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY -- SO NEXT STEPS WILL BE. CONTINUING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE WORKING GROUP'S OF BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY. AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH ADMINISTRATION I DO KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS WITH -- CD AT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE. TO HERE ANY SOLUTIONS WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY I'M HAVING TO TAKE IN OUR OWN HANDS. BUT I PROMISE YOU CENTER TO LET A IT'S ABOUT MS OF MOST IMPORTANCE. CENTER GALGIANI UP DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHETHER THE COUNTY LEVEL PROCESS IS THE SAME COUNTY BY COUNTY OR IS IT THAT CDFA HAS TO DEAL WITH FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT. LOCAL PROCESSES AND SO FORTH WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO THEN. THERE I BELIEVE IT'S IN STATUTE -- COUNTIES HAVE SIXTY DAYS OF DIFFERENT ORDINANCES SO THE PROCESS FOR THE FOR THE APPLICANT BASED ON EACH COUNTY IS DIFFERENT BUT THE COUNTY DOES NEED TO REPLY TO THE STATE WHEN ASKED WITHIN SIXTY DAYS CORRECT. BECAUSE I COULD SEE WHERE IF IF I'M A STAFF MEMBER AT CDFA AND I'M LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE LICENSE APPLICATIONS AND EVERYTHING COMING MY WAY IS DIFFERENT ALL THE FORMS ARE DIFFERENT I HAVE TO LOOK IN DIFFERENT PLACES TO FIND. THE INFORMATION I COULD SEE WHERE THAT WOULD SLOW THINGS UP SOME JUST WONDERING IF THAT'S A PART OF THE PROBLEM. I THINK THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL CHALLENGES BUT I I MY BOTTOM LINE AND CONTINUE TO COME BACK TO IS WE'VE KNOWN THIS WAS GOING. TO HIT US. IN HIT US HARD ON IN THAT IS WHERE. I HAVE SOME FRUSTRATION I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE CHAIR I BELIEVE HE HAS SOME FRUSTRATION -- IN IT IS HUMAN NATURE. ANYTIME. ODD THAT I I KNOW I'M LIKE THIS IF IT'S GOING TO COST ME A LOT OF MONEY AND IT'S GONNA BE COMPLICATED I'M GONNA WAIT TO THE LAST MINUTE. WE SAW AB. SHOOT YOU RUSH. TO SECURE A TEMPORARY LICENSE OF TO TEAM SO THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE -- CDFA SIDE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF APPLICATIONS COMING IN THOSE LAST NINETY DAYS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND IF IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND BAND WITH. WITH -- BUDGET ALLOCATIONS THROUGH BUDGET SUB TWO WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THEM TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN THE SIXTY NINE HUNDRED NUMBER. SENATOR MCGUIRE WELL IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE WERE  LOT LAST MINUTE APPLICATIONS IS IT ALSO FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE WERE HUNDREDS IF NOT. THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE YEAR. YES OKAY THAT IS OF AN AND YOUR SUMMARY IS THAT THAT CDFA IS PROVIDED [inaudible] FOR FOR CALL CULTIVATION Là ANNUAL LICENSES IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME FOR THEIR WEBSITE OKAY BECAUSE I'M SENSITIVE TO A NEW ADMINISTRATION. AND THEY GET THE CHANCE TO GET THEIR FEET ON THE GROUND FOR SURE. BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY EXPLAIN -- IS A LOT MORE TO THE TO WHAT'S WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING -- CERTAINLY THE SENSITIVITY -- TO THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY ISSUE IS GOOD BUT THE AT THAT WOULD BE WHY WE SHOULD HAVE CDFA HERE. GIVING US AN EXPLANATION AND I THINK THAT I KNOW THE AUTHOR AND CERTAINLY TO ME. IS THAT WERE NOT GIVEN ANY EXPLANATION FOR WHY WERE IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE. BUT NOT JUST UNDERSTAND IT BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS HELPFUL. IN DOING WHAT WE HAVE MUTUAL GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH AND WE'RE NOT EVEN CLEAR ON THAT ALTHOUGH I THINK THIS LEGISLATION.
