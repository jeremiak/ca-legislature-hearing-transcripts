UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD I

00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:43.320
WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT JUST FOR A

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:44.188
MOMENT.

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:45.322
WHEN PLACES FLORIDA THE STATE OF

00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:46.691
FLORIDA IS THE LEADER A

00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:48.325
PRESCRIBED FIRE AND FUEL HAZARD

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:49.560
MANNER MANAGEMENT IN THE UNITED

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:51.128
STATES?

00:38:51.195 --> 00:38:52.630
WE THINK FOR OF ALL PLACES FOR

00:38:52.697 --> 00:38:55.032
THE VERY PYRO CENTRIC STATE LOT

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:57.201
OF FIRE THEY BURNED ONE POINT

00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:57.735
TWO MILLION ACRES LAST YOU

00:38:57.802 --> 00:38:58.969
PRESCRIBE BURNING.

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:00.771
THEY DID PRETTY WELL THEY DID

00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:01.605
HAVE ONE ESCAPE THAT ACTUALLY

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:03.240
THE TRAGEDY ONE THAT HASN'T

00:39:03.307 --> 00:39:04.608
HAPPENED ABOUT FORTY YEARS.

00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:06.143
STILL THEY DO A LOT OF GOOD WORK

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.478
IN FLOOR AND IT SHOWS IS THAT

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:08.879
IT'S POSSIBLE TO MAYBE DO MORE

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:10.514
PROACTIVE FUELS MANAGEMENT IN A

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:11.982
PLACE WITH THE HAS INCREDIBLE

00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:12.149
BIG.

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.851
WHILE IN URBAN INTERFACE WESTERN

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.386
AUSTRALIA WESTERN AUSTRALIA

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:16.887
PERTH IS ANOTHER AREA OF THE

00:39:16.954 --> 00:39:17.955
WORLD WHERE.

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.390
BIG PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAM THEY

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:21.025
BRING ONE TO THREE HUNDRED

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:21.592
THOUSAND ACRES AROUND PERTH

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:23.294
PERTH HAS OVER MILLION PEOPLE.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.862
SO THEY HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:25.963
FIFTY YEAR PROGRAM OF ACTUALLY

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.364
DOING PROACTIVE BURNING AND

00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:28.132
ACTUALLY WORKING WITH

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:29.700
COMMUNITIES AND ALSO ECOSYSTEMS

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:30.835
ANOTHER PLACE THAT ANOTHER

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:32.770
SUCCESS STORY.

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:34.271
ENTER THE FORCE YOU KNOW WE SAW

00:39:34.338 --> 00:39:35.339
THE HIGH MORTALITY ADVANCE OF

00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:36.974
THAT SOUTHERN SIERRA LAST FEW

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:39.143
YEARS AND HUNDRED MILLION TREES

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.478
PLUS DYING AND THEN THERE ARE

00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:42.012
THE PLACES WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:43.114
FORCED A MUCH MORE RESILIENT

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.315
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A LOWER

00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:45.916
DENSITIES MORE HAD ORIGINATING

00:39:45.983 --> 00:39:47.585
MORE VARIABILITY. ONE SUCH PLACE

00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:48.652
THIS YEAR'S AND PAGE MARK HERE

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:51.355
NORTHERN WESTERN MEXICO AND

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:52.656
WORKING ON THEIR TWENTY YEARS.

00:39:52.723 --> 00:39:53.858
THAT PLACE HAS THE SAME DROUGHT

00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:55.526
TO GET BURNED BY WILDFIRES WE GO

00:39:55.593 --> 00:39:57.027
DOWN THERE EVERY TIME I GO DOWN

00:39:57.094 --> 00:39:58.796
THERE I AM INSPIRED.

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:00.498
BECAUSE OF JUST THE INCREDIBLE

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:01.932
RESILIENCE THAT FORCED. THREE

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:03.901
YEAR DROUGHT FALL BY A WILDFIRE

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:06.070
80% THE TREES SURVIVE.

00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:07.538
SO IF TO PLACE IT ACTUALLY EVERY

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:08.639
TIME I GO THERE WAS THERE ABOUT

00:40:08.706 --> 00:40:09.507
TWO MONTHS AGO FOR PUBLIC THE

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:11.041
TWENTIETH TIME EVERY TIME I GO

00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:12.276
THERE AND WORK.

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:13.744
I JUST REALIZED WHAT CALIFORNIA

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:15.079
FORCE COULD BE.

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:17.148
WITH A LOOK AT MORE ACTIVITY IN

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:17.681
TERMS OF MANAGEMENT FEELS

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:19.884
TREATMENT.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:20.785
ELECTRIC BASS AND HAS A PLACE IN

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.086
THE SEMI NATIONAL PARK HAS BEEN

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:24.088
MANAGED BY LIGHTNING FIRE FOR

00:40:24.155 --> 00:40:25.489
FORTY FIVE YEARS SO THIS IS AN

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:26.557
AREA REMOTE COUNTRY WHERE YOU

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:28.125
CAN PUT FIRE ON THE GROUND BY

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:30.227
LIGHTNING ALLOW IT TO BURN.

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:30.828
MOST TIME FIRES GOING ON THEIR

00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:31.962
OWN.

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.164
THEY'VE HIT EACH OTHER AND THEY

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.465
SIMPLY GO OUT AND WE'VE BEEN

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:35.699
WORKING UP THERE FOR MANY YEARS

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:37.001
AND WE SEE THE HEADERS AND

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:38.202
EIGHTEEN ALSO THE LOWER

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:39.970
DENSITIES HIGH DENSITY AREAS.

00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:41.005
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY SEEM TO BE

00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:42.339
A CO BENEFIT WERE SEEN MORE

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:43.440
WATER COMING FROM THE WATERSHEDS

00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:45.209
VILLA CREEK.

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:45.843
SO WE SEEM TO HAVE A WATER COULD

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.445
BENEFIT. ONE OTHER THING I MIGHT

00:40:48.512 --> 00:40:49.747
TO SAY IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE DONE

00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:51.549
SOME WORK HERE IN BLODGETT

00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:53.184
FORCED BLODGETT FORCES THE UC

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.518
BERKELEY RESEARCH FORCE WE'VE

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:55.820
BEEN LOOKING AT FEEL TREATMENTS

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.087
BOTH THINNING.

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:58.422
PRESCRIBED BURNING THINNING AND

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:00.090
PRESCRIBE BRING TOGETHER.

00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:01.559
WE WORKED UP THERE ALMOST TWENTY

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:02.193
YEARS ON THIS AND WE'VE REALLY

00:41:02.259 --> 00:41:03.561
COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:04.895
FUEL TREATMENTS DESIGNED FOR

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:06.831
RESTORATION THE TARGET LADDER

00:41:06.897 --> 00:41:08.065
FUELS SMALLER TREES.

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:10.067
ECOLOGICALLY ARE DOING ANY HARM

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.702
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT REALLY HOW

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:13.103
YOU MIGHT DO AN IMPLEMENTATION

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.905
FORCE IN CALIFORNIA BLODGETT

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:16.240
SHOWS US THAT WE CAN DO A LOT OF

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:17.608
GOOD WORK AND REALLY HAVE NO

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:18.475
ECOLOGICAL.

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:21.745
PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF THOSE FORCE.

00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:22.713
SO WHAT ABOUT A COUPLE QUICK

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.281
THINGS ABOUT CALIFORNIA WHAT

00:41:24.348 --> 00:41:25.316
THINGS MIGHT WE WANT TO THINK

00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:26.750
ABOUT IF WE GO FORWARD.

00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:28.118
CALIFORNIA HAS ITS VEGETATION

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.353
TREATMENT PROGRAM ENVIRONMENT

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.788
IMPACT REPORT THIS IS BEEN

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:32.456
SOMETHING GOING ON FOR ABOUT

00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:33.924
FIVE YEARS OR LONGER THIS IS A

00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:34.959
PROGRAMMATIC.

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:35.526
DOCUMENT THAT WILL ACTUALLY

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:38.028
ALLOW.

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:39.496
THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PLAN

00:41:39.563 --> 00:41:41.632
PROGRAMS IMPLEMENT PRESCRIBED

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:42.867
BURNING MORE EFFICIENTLY.

00:41:42.933 --> 00:41:44.168
IT'S BEEN STUCK IN THE BOARD OF

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:45.836
FORESTRY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS --

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:47.171
WE ACTUALLY GET A PEER REVIEW

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:48.372
FOR THAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA FIRE

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.174
SCIENCE CONSORTIUM ABOUT. THREE

00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:51.942
FOUR YEARS AGO OUTSIDE PANEL

00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:53.577
HELD PUBLIC MEETINGS THE

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:54.645
DOCUMENTS SEEM TO BE PRETTY GOOD

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:57.047
SHAPE BUT IT IS SOMEHOW STUCK IN

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:58.148
THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AT THAT

00:41:58.215 --> 00:41:59.516
CAME OUT I THINK WE COULD

00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:00.851
ACTUALLY SEE SOMETHING POSITIVE.

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:02.152
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE I

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:03.921
THINK ABOUT THINGS COULD HAPPEN.

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:05.823
I THINK MANY OF US MIGHT TALK

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:06.557
ABOUT THE PACE AND SCALE

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:07.925
TREATMENTS ON THE ADVOCATE FOR

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:09.460
TRYING TO DO MORE TRYING TO DO

00:42:09.526 --> 00:42:10.995
BETTER IN TERMS IT ECOLOGICALLY

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:12.396
DOING FUEL TREATMENT BECAUSE WE

00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:13.898
AREN'T DOING ENOUGH.

00:42:13.964 --> 00:42:15.232
ESPECIALLY IN FORCE WE TALK

00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:16.634
ABOUT TROUBLING TO DEFER

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.935
CONVERSATION UNFORTUNATELY WE

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:19.703
TALK ABOUT FORCE WE CAN DO A LOT

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.771
BETTER BACK OF THE ENVELOPE

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:23.073
CALCULATION WE NEED TO DO FIVE

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.408
TO TEN TIMES MORE PER YEAR. TO

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:26.277
REALLY GET A HANDLE ON THIS AND

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:28.679
WE COULD DO IT ECOLOGICALLY.

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:30.347
NOTHING I WOULDN'T MENTION IS IF

00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:31.682
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:32.950
BREACH THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:34.385
KNOW WE HAVE URBAN WHILE AN

00:42:34.451 --> 00:42:35.519
INTERFACE WE HAVE FORCE

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:38.055
RESILIENCY PROBLEMS.

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.156
UNIVERSAL CALIFORNIA HAS AN

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:40.591
EXTENSION SERVICE FOR WE HAVE

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:42.359
PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DO OUTREACH

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:43.460
WE DO THIS AND THINGS LIKE RAIN

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:44.895
SCIENCE WE GET IN AGRICULTURE WE

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:46.797
GET A LOT OF DIFFERENT FIELDS.

00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:47.898
WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.867
DUDE AND FIRE.

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:50.734
SITE ONE THING I THINK WOULD BE

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:52.036
INTERESTING BECAUSE MAYBE HAVE A

00:42:52.102 --> 00:42:53.170
FOCUSED OUTREACH PROGRAM THAT

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:54.238
ACTUALLY [inaudible]

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:56.540
IN COUNTIES PEOPLE OF MASTER'S

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:57.808
DEGREES THAT WOULD WORK

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.310
COLLECTIVELY WITH CITY COUNCIL'S

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:01.779
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PUBLICS AND

00:43:01.845 --> 00:43:03.080
BRING THE IDEAS OF WHAT YOU

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:04.048
MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOCALLY AND TRY

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:05.516
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:06.650
LIKE US ALL THE PROBABLY WOULD

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:08.118
REDUCE THE PROBLEM.

00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:09.453
I'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN SO MANY

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.322
OTHER PARTS OF KIND OF NATURIST

00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:12.623
HORSES WE KNOW ENOUGH TO DATE

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:13.557
THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY HELP

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:14.692
PEOPLE PREPARE FOR FIRE AND DO

00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:16.160
BETTER.

00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:17.227
SO I THINK THIS IDEA PUTTING

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:18.662
PEOPLE IN NATURAL RESOURCE

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:20.264
FIELDS INTO COUNTIES WHERE

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.799
PEOPLE LIVE WOULD BE A REALLY

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:23.267
INTERESTING WAY TO GO AND GIVE

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:24.969
US A CALIFORNIA'S HAD SOME

00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:25.636
SUCCESS WITH SOME OTHER PROGRAMS

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:26.337
LIKE THAT.

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:27.805
MISTER STEVENS AND I HATE TO

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:29.873
INTERRUPT YOUR AYE I SHOULD HAVE

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:30.507
SAID AT THE VERY BEGINNING WE'RE

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:31.108
GOING TO ALLEN FIVE MINUTES TO

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:32.843
EACH THE PRISONERS.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.178
AND SO HAVING NOT GIVING YOU

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.879
THAT A PRE WARNING IF YOU

00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:37.247
CONCLUDE IN THE NEXT AND I AM

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:38.415
LIKE THAT WAS ACTUALLY MY LAST

00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:39.850
LITTLE COMMENT SO THE ONLY THING

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:41.218
I'D ACTUALLY WANT TO CLOSE WITH

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:42.052
THIS HOPE.

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:43.787
YOU NO BECAUSE I CAN'T AGAIN I

00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:45.489
FEEL SOMETIMES WITH ON CLIMATE

CHANGE WE HAVE THIS I GET THE

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.858
NEW NORMAL.

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:48.759
IS THIS THE NEW NORMAL THAT'S AN

00:43:48.826 --> 00:43:50.294
INTERESTING TOPIC THE IDEA OF

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:51.562
NEW NORMAL KIND OF FEELS LIKE TO

00:43:51.628 --> 00:43:52.863
ME WERE KIND OF GIVEN UP.

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:53.897
I THINK THAT THE NEW NORMAL

00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:55.499
ACTUALLY CANCEL HAVE INCREDIBLE

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.167
INPUT FROM MANAGEMENT AND

00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:58.335
CREATIVITY THAT WE COULD

00:43:58.402 --> 00:43:59.470
ACTUALLY DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE

00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:00.738
SO I'M VERY HOPEFUL WHEN IT

00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:01.271
COMES A FIRE IN THE STATE

00:44:01.338 --> 00:44:01.572
[inaudible]

00:44:01.638 --> 00:44:08.779
THANK YOU.

QUICKLY FIRE PREVENTION FIRE

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:21.191
PLANNING [inaudible]

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:23.894
FOREST HEALTH.

00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:25.796
FIRE PREVENTION IS ABOUT

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:28.499
PREVENTING UNCHARACTERISTIC FIRE.

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:30.868
WHILE EXPANDING THE BENEFICIAL

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:32.836
USES A FIRE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:34.671
THE POINT IS THE FIRST POINT IS

00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:36.373
THAT CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.208
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.

00:44:38.275 --> 00:44:40.044
WHAT CALIFORNIA SCIENTISTS AND

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:41.845
LAND MANAGERS ALREADY KNOW FIRE

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:44.114
HAS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:45.816
SHAPING AND BUILDING RESILIENCE

00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:47.484
IN THE DIVERSE LANDSCAPES OF OUR

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.786
STATE FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:50.487
YEARS?

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:51.955
WE NEED TO WORK ON LIMITING

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:53.924
UNCHARACTERISTIC DAMAGING FIRES

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:55.893
WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:57.561
THE ROLE OF BENEFICIAL FIRE FROM

00:44:57.628 --> 00:44:59.463
MULTIPLE RESOURCE BENEFITS.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.398
THOSE BENEFITS INCLUDE

00:45:01.465 --> 00:45:01.698
[inaudible]

00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:03.500
ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE.

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.569
CARBON STABILITY REDUCED

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:07.337
EMISSIONS AND IMPACTS ON PUBLIC

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:08.338
HEALTH AND FINALLY COMMUNITY

00:45:08.405 --> 00:45:10.240
PROTECTION.

00:45:10.307 --> 00:45:12.109
WE ALL KNOW THIS.

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:14.044
AND THIS YEAR'S LEGISLATIVE

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:15.312

REALLY MOVE THE BALL IN A

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.351
POSITIVE DIRECTION WE NEED TO

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:24.121
KEEP THIS UP. FOR EVER IN THE

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:25.389
STATE UNTIL WE GET THIS

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:27.191
LANDSCAPE RESTORED.

00:45:27.257 --> 00:45:28.826
IN TERMS OF AND I'VE LISTED A

00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:31.395

00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:34.331
YOU MIGHT WANNA LOOK AT THERE'S

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:36.467
TREMENDOUS WORK GOING ON RIGHT

00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:37.101
NOW AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.203
OF THEM --

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:41.038
AND THAT IS THE FIRE IN WILL YOU

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:43.340
PARTNERSHIP WHICH IS THIRTY

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:44.875
THREE PARTNERS NOW IN CALIFORNIA

00:45:44.942 --> 00:45:46.310
INCLUDING CAL FIRE AND SEE YOU

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:47.511
IN ABOUT A CONSERVANCY FOR

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:48.745
SERVICE.

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:52.516
AND OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:54.351
AND AN ASTOUNDING THING IS WE'RE

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:56.286
FROM TO AND A SIGN OF PROGRESS

00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:58.055
THAT WE HAVE THREE AIR DISTRICTS

00:45:58.122 --> 00:45:59.356
THAT HAVE JOINED.

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:00.124
THE FIRE I AM ARE YOU

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.159
PARTNERSHIP TO PROMOTE EXPANDING

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:03.894
FIRE USE FOR ECOLOGICAL AND

00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:05.462
OTHER BENEFITS.

00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:07.931
IN TERMS OF FIRE PLANNING.

00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:09.166
I THINK THE FIRST PRINCIPAL

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:11.435
NEEDS TO BE THAT THERE IS NO NO

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:14.771
FIRE OPTION IN CALIFORNIA. TO

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.640
UNDERSTAND THAT AND THEN WE

00:46:16.707 --> 00:46:18.642
STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE USE OF

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:20.177
THE STATE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:22.379
RESEARCH OPR WILDFIRE PLANNING

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:24.181
GUIDELINES TO LINK IS LISTED

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:24.848
THERE.

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:26.783
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE ON

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:27.251
THE TABLE IN ALL THESE

00:46:27.317 --> 00:46:30.487
ADOPTED

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:32.956
OF ALL COUNTY GENERAL PLANS.

00:46:33.023 --> 00:46:34.525
WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:36.260
FIRE HISTORY FIRE REGIME

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:37.995

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:40.664
MORE.

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:42.900
RIGID LINES SHOULD BE FOR OPEN

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:44.835
SPACE AND BIKE TRAILS NOT

00:46:44.902 --> 00:46:45.969
DENSELY PACKED MILLION DOLLAR

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:48.438
HOMES.

00:46:48.505 --> 00:46:49.907
THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENT

00:46:49.973 --> 00:46:51.742
IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT COMES UP A

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:53.410
LOT WHEN WE'RE IN RURAL AREAS

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:54.511
MANY OF YOU COME FROM RURAL

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:56.113
LANDSCAPES.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.682
IT'S MANDATORY IT'S NOT OPTIONAL

00:46:58.749 --> 00:46:59.550
BUT WE'RE STILL ACTING LIKE IT'S

00:46:59.616 --> 00:47:01.151
OPTIONAL.

00:47:01.218 --> 00:47:02.953
IT IS MANDATORY HOME CLEARANCE

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.922
WORK NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED FOR

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:06.123
THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD IT TO GET

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.358
THE WORK DONE [inaudible]

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:12.429
AND WE ARE IN A PUBLIC SAFETY

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:14.631
CRISIS AND HOPE PROTECTION IS

00:47:14.698 --> 00:47:16.767
NOT OPTIONAL WE NEED TO SUPPORT

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.235
FOLKS BUT WE ALSO NEED TO

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:19.703
MANDATE REQUIRE THAT IT GETS

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:20.103
DONE.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.272
HOME HARDENING IS ABSOLUTELY

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:23.941
ESSENTIAL AND THIS PENDING

00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:26.276
LEGISLATION IN FRONT OF

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:28.212
LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR IT HAS A

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:29.980
LOT TO SAY ABOUT SUPPORTING HOME

00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:31.748
HARDENING IN EXPANDING RESOURCES

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:33.283
TO PROTECT HOMES.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:34.751
ADDITIONAL WATER SUPPLIES

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:36.520
MAINTAIN CLEARANCE RETROFITTED

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:38.822
HOMES COMMUNITY WIDE EFFORTS TO

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:41.024
CREATE LARGER LANDSCAPES.

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:42.759
ARE ALL IMPORTANT THINGS IN

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:44.494
TERMS OF BUILDING FIRE

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:45.429
RESILIENCE IN THE MOVIE IN

00:47:45.495 --> 00:47:47.397
PARTICULAR.

00:47:47.464 --> 00:47:50.133
DOING THE WORK AND AND UP DON'T

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.768
ALWAYS EXPECT AN ENGINE THAT'S

00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:53.503
GOING TO COME AND SAVE YOU.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:56.373
IT OFTEN IS NOT THE CASE WE HAVE

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.375
TO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY

00:47:58.442 --> 00:47:59.243
FOR LIVING IN THESE FIRE SO

00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:01.111
CHEATED LANDSCAPES.

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:02.646
I WANT A SECOND WHAT SCOTT SAID

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:04.581
BRIEFLY ABOUT THE EXPANDED ROLE

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:06.350
OF YOU SEE FIRE ADVISORS.

PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO RESTORE

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:11.054
FIRE ON THEIR LANDS OR BY

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:12.322
FORMING PRESCRIBED BURN

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:13.790
ASSOCIATIONS WERE COMMUNITIES

00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:15.392
WORK TOGETHER TO EXPAND FIRE

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:16.893
RESTORATION AT THE COMMUNITY

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.794
LEVEL.

00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:19.029
WERE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:21.698
CONCEPT I PERSONALLY ATTENDED A

00:48:21.765 --> 00:48:22.899
WORKSHOP THAT WASN'T.

00:48:22.966 --> 00:48:25.235
CREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN BUILDING

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:26.670
AND BRINGING THE COMMUNITY

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.038
TOGETHER THAT KNEW.

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:29.306
SOMETHING ABOUT FIRE BUT THEY

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:30.807
HAVE ACTUAL GROUP TORCH IN THEIR

00:48:30.874 --> 00:48:32.242
HANDS AND WORKING TO REDUCE

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:33.844
FUELS ON THEIR PROPERTY WAS

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:35.012
AMAZING.

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:36.580
LAST THING IS FOR US HEALTH AND

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:40.417
NOW OFFER THAT FIRE RESILIENCE.

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:41.418
AND FOREST HEALTH OR NOT

00:48:41.485 --> 00:48:43.353
SEPARATE ISSUES.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.855
THE ORIGIN OF FOREST HEALTH IN

00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:46.757
CALIFORNIA BEYOND NATURAL

00:48:46.823 --> 00:48:49.259
BACKGROUND LEVELS OF PROBLEMS.

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:51.161
IS A DIRECT RESULT OF HISTORIC

00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:52.729
FIRE EXCLUSION IN THE HIGH

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:53.897
GRADING AND CLEAR CUTTING OF

00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:57.167
LARGE FIRE RESILIENT TREES.

00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:58.602
ABSENT THE REINTRODUCTION OF

00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:01.071
PLAN FIRE AS A MAJOR MANAGEMENT

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:03.106
TOOL AN INCREASE PROTECTIONS AND

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:05.275
INCENTIVES FOR LARGE TO RESTORE

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:07.044
LARGE ECOLOGICALLY APPROPRIATE

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:10.180
TREES WE WILL NEVER REACH.

00:49:10.247 --> 00:49:11.848
A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF NEVER

00:49:11.915 --> 00:49:13.050
REACH RESILIENCE ON A

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:14.251
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:16.053
CALIFORNIA LANDSCAPE.

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:17.621
WERE MECHANICAL TREATMENTS ARE

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:19.523
REQUIRED OVERLY DENSE STANDS

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:21.291
UNCHARACTERISTIC DENSE TREES

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:23.760
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO COMMUNITIES.

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:25.095
THERE'S A BROAD SCIENTIFIC

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:26.530
CONSENSUS THAT TREATING LADDER

00:49:26.596 --> 00:49:28.899
FUELS SHOULD STILL BE THE

00:49:28.965 --> 00:49:30.634
PRIMARY CONCERN.

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:31.835
THE SURFACE ON LADDER FUELS

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:33.370
SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY CONCERN IN

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:34.805
TARGET FOR LIMITING FIRE

00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:38.141
BEHAVIOR SMALLER TREES UP TO

00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:38.742
SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:40.210
DIAMETER MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF

00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:41.645
THAT COMPONENT.

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:43.814
FINALLY THE THING THE NEGLECTED

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.349
STEPCHILD OF ALL OF OUR REAR

00:49:45.415 --> 00:49:47.084
RESTORATION EFFORTS IS

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:50.921
MAINTAINING THE BENEFITS THAT WE

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:51.555
PRODUCED ON THE LANDSCAPE I'VE

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:52.456
GOT A THIRTY YEAR HISTORY.

00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:54.991
OF WITNESSING WORK BEING DONE

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:56.593
SOME OF IT NOT GREAT SOME OF IT

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.462
GREAT SOME OF IT WE HAD A DIRECT

00:49:58.528 --> 00:49:59.429
HAND IN.

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:01.431
BUT THE FAILURE TO COME BACK AND

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:03.333
MAINTAIN THAT RESILIENCE IS A

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.569
ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL TRAGEDY

00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:07.671
FOR ALL THE SOCIAL CAPITAL AND

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:09.406
DOLLARS THAT WE'VE INVESTED. TO

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:11.742
FIRE AS A PRIMARY MAINTENANCE

00:50:11.808 --> 00:50:13.977
TOOL IN THESE TREATMENTS SHOULD

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:15.712
NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS DOES A OR

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:16.880
YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE JUST

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:18.115
PUT OFF ON THE SIDE OF THE TABLE

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:19.416
AND FORGET ABOUT ITS FREQUENT

00:50:19.483 --> 00:50:21.451

EFFECTS OF NATURAL FIRE.

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:23.954
WOULD ALSO LIMIT

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.790
UNCHARACTERISTIC OF BY OF TREES

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:27.824
THAT WE SEE ON THIS LANDSCAPE

THERE OR SHOULD WE JUST TAKE THE

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:46.856
BILL AS IT IS NOW IN --

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:48.958
YOU SAID IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:50.693
MODELED GOING FORWARD ANOTHER

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.495
WHICH DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:53.462
SUGGESTIONS WE MIGHT.

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:56.098
INCLUDED AS WE WRAP UP THE THE

01:03:56.165 --> 01:04:04.006
CONTENT TO THAT BILL.

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:08.044
YOU WON'T GET FIRED.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.679
FOR WE'RE BLESSED FROM A REMINDS

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:12.315
ME THAT --

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:14.850
FIRST ALL OF THESE BILLS --

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:15.618
WE'RE TELLING YOU WHAT'S IN THE

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:18.854
BILLS RIGHT NOW --

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:20.523
WE CAN'T PREDICT --

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.558
IF IF THE ADMINISTRATION'S GONNA

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:23.826
RECOMMEND CHANGES WORTH

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:24.827
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES ARE

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:27.029
GOING TO RECOMMEND CHANGES.

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:28.397
SO I THINK THAT APPLIES TO WHAT

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:31.901
I'VE SAID ABOUT ALL THESE --

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:37.073
I THINK --

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:39.475
I'M I'M WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF --

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.644
THERE ARE.

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:42.612
I THINK THERE ARE SOME REALLY

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:45.381
SMALL TWEAKS THAT WE'RE WE'RE

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:46.649
CONSIDERING.

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:49.352
NOTHING SIGNIFICANT --

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:53.322
AND THE ONE MAJOR QUESTION I

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:54.257
THINK WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:56.592
THE ADMINISTRATION ON AND WITH

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:59.495
CAL FIRE ON ARE THE SPECIAL

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.063
CONSIDERATIONS --

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.431
FOR COASTAL POINT COMMUNITIES --

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:05.301
WHICH IS. TWO WERE IN THE

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:07.169
PROCESS OF RESOLVING THAT.

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:07.403
SO -- I

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:13.643
THINK.

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:14.610
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THAT

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:15.911
BILLS CLOSE [inaudible]

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:16.512
TO CLUSTER DOT.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.381
I WONDER IF OUR EXPERT FROM OF

01:05:18.447 --> 01:05:18.914
BERKELEY --

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:19.448
PROFESSOR STEVENS HAS ANY

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:22.618
THOUGHTS.

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:24.120
I'VE SEEN THE BILL AND PARTS

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:25.054
OVER THAT PERIOD LOOK AT THE

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:26.522
LANGUAGE I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:27.490
INNOVATE I HAVE TO REALLY I

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:28.958
DIDN'T SAY THIS IN MY COMMENTS I

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:29.592
HAVE TO GIVE THE STATE'S A REAL

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:31.160
CREDIT.

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:32.028
YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE BEEN DOING

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:33.195
THIS BUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:34.230
AND I'VE NEVER REALLY SEEN THE

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:37.867
STATE CUT TO GET INTO THIS AREA

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:49.545
FIRE FUELS RESTORATION IS MUCH.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:57.453
THE DELTA SEEMS LIKE IT'S ALWAYS

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.487
BEEN THE BIG ISSUE WHEN I LOOK

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:00.389
AT IT FROM AFAR SO I REALLY

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:01.924
THINK THAT YOUR YOUR BILL IS

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:05.461
REALLY FORWARD LOOKING I THINK

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:16.105
IT TAXI VERY FOR WITH THE

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:18.174
LEGISLATION THAT YOU FOSTERED IN

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:18.774
THE OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:21.043
MENTIONED.

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:22.478
AS HE DID YEAH I I INITIALLY

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:23.546
COUPLE YEARS BACK.

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:25.081
THERE WAS SOME REAL TENSION

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:27.016
BETWEEN AIR REGULATIONS AND THE

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:28.751
NEED TO PUT MORE FIRE ON THE

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:29.018
LANDSCAPE.

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:33.222
WE IT'S NEVER AN EASY ISSUE.

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:34.090
BUT THAT WAS ONE THING I WAS

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.424
WONDERING WHAT IF WE SHOULD TRY

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:37.126
TO DO SOMETHING IN A BILL OR CAN

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:39.061
WE WORK THROUGH OUR EXCELLENT

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:41.197
STAFF AND THE RELATIONSHIPS WE

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:42.665
HAVE TO SEE IF WE CAN HAVE

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:43.532
FARTHER SITE I THINK.

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:45.368
WATCHING THE PROGRESS CLOSELY

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:46.602
AND NEVER LETTING GO OF THIS

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.437
ISSUE KNOW THAT WE'D KEEP IT ON

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:50.740
THE FRONT BURNER PARDON THE PUN.

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:52.708
FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO GET

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:53.876
US THROUGH THE NEED TO GOING TO

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:55.411
COULD BE A GENERATION.

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:56.912
BUT WE NEED TO STAY ON IT THAT

01:06:56.979 --> 01:06:59.248
THE AIR COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:00.416
THIS YOU MAY NOT.

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:01.984
HAVE HEARD THIS BUT IN OREGON

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:03.452
AND WASHINGTON THEY'RE NOT GET

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:04.620
ALONG SO GREAT WITH THE FIRE

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.021
PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:07.623
RESTORE FIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.191
WE WITH THE AIRPORT HERE IN THE

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:11.227
AIR DISTRICTS COLLABORATIVE WE'D

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:13.662
JOINING THIS PRO FIRE PRO

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.398
PRESCRIBED BURNING PARTNERSHIP.

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:16.966
IT'S MINUTES FOUNDING WE JUST

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:18.200
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:20.770
GETTING ECOLOGICALLY SIGNIFICANT.

01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:22.838
FIRE AND WORK ON THE LAND OVER

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:25.007
TIME THAT'S THE TEST THINK YOU

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:26.575
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO ATTACK

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:29.178
ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES BILLS SO

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:30.246
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO UNIFY

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:31.414
COULD TAKE THE HEAT ON IT SO TO

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.014
SPEAK.

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:32.748
BUT CERTAINLY --

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:34.283
PERHAPS THE MONITORING IS

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.585
SOMETHING ON ALL OF OUR BILLS

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:37.052
YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE.

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:38.721
EXPECTATIONS WE NEED TO MAKE

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.423
SURE THERE --

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:40.956
THE FIELD I HAVE ONE OTHER

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:42.658
QUESTION --

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:44.160
WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT HARDENING

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:46.395
OUR HOMES.

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:49.665
HARDENING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.535
I WONDER IF --

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:53.269
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:55.504
POSSIBILITY OF BRINGING IN THE

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:57.706
PACE PROGRAM.

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:59.408
AND ADDING --

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.777
ADD TO IT --

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:04.747
THE ABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS.

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:07.316
TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THOSE KINDS

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:08.384
OF LOANS WITH THE CHICKEN

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:09.852
AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE FOR

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.153
THEIR HOMES. TO WENT TO

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.155
ENCOURAGE THIS KIND OF HARDENING

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:14.790
WHETHER IT'S I GUESS SAID DOUBLE

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:17.159
PANE GLASS FOR EXAMPLE IS VERY

01:08:17.226 --> 01:08:18.527
HELPFUL IN.

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:19.995
REDUCING THE HEAT THAT THAT

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:21.797
FIRES CREATED AND BLOWING OUT

01:08:21.864 --> 01:08:23.365
WINDOWS AND LIGHTING UP TO DRAW

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.267
THE DRAPES AND DESTROYING HOMES.

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:27.336
AND NOT A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS --

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:29.939
ANY THOUGHTS ON WHY ON WHETHER

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:31.273
ADDING --

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:32.908
THIS SAID TO THE PACE PROGRAM

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:35.077
THE HARDENING OF OUR HOMES WOULD

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:37.546
BE HELPFUL --

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.849
ARAB.

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:40.816
PUT I CAN OFFERED SOME THOUGHTS

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:47.556
AND I A VERY SMART THING TO DO --

01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:51.894
THE THE STATE'S SYSTEM OF GRANTS.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.362
FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT AND

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.431
DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND ALL THE

01:08:55.498 --> 01:08:56.765
THINGS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.000
FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND JUST A

01:08:58.067 --> 01:09:00.736
COUPLE OF MINUTES --

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.805
AREN'T REALLY DESIGNED TO HELP

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.573
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:04.874
[inaudible]

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:09.612
AND INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS NEED.

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:12.515
SOME SORT OF MECHANISM. TO

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:14.617
UNDERTAKE THESE STRUCTURAL

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:19.021
RETROFITS TO THEIR HOUSES --

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:20.155
THE PACE PROGRAM AS A BASICALLY

01:09:20.222 --> 01:09:21.557
A PRIVATE SECTOR PROGRAM THAT

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:23.492
ALLOWS THEM TO SELF FINANCE

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:23.792
[inaudible]

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:26.862
AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL HAS A

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:32.234
LIST OF RETROFITS THAT ARE

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:33.602
APPROVED BUT FOR THIS VERY

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.538
PURPOSE.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:38.073
AND I THINK THAT THE PIECE

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:42.044
PROGRAM OR A SIMILAR EFFORT IS

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.779
NOT GOING TO BE NEEDED. TO

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:48.150
CREATE A WHO A MEANINGFUL WAY

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:49.985
FOR THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:51.654
HOMEOWNERS ACROSS THE STATE.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.622
THAT NEED SOME FINANCIAL

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.524
ASSISTANCE THEM TO VOLUNTARILY

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:58.694
MAKE THESE RETROFITS

01:09:58.761 --> 01:09:58.994
[inaudible]

01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:00.696
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:02.698
MISTER DALI.

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:03.599
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.568
CHAIR.

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:06.635
I WON OF JUST THE I THINK THE

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:08.137
SENATORS ON THE RIGHT TRACK WE

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:09.772
TALK TALKING ABOUT FIRE BUT

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:10.372
THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.707
DOWN.

01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:12.708
I LIKE TO ADDRESS ON THE FIRE

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:15.678
ISSUES THAT. ONE OF THE THERE'S

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:17.446
BEEN WE'VE HAD GOALS THE FOREST

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:19.348
SERVICE HAS GOALS OF HALF A

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:20.482
MILLION ACRES YEAR THAT THEY

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:20.683
WANT.

01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:21.350
TO TRY [inaudible]

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:22.918
TO BURN.

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:24.687
AND THE BIGGEST.

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:26.288
HURDLE IS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GO

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:28.057
TO IMPLEMENT IT ON THE GROUND

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:28.691
AND THERE'S A THERE'S FOR SMALL

01:10:28.757 --> 01:10:30.392
NUMBER ONE THERE'S A LIABILITY

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:31.860
IF THE FIRE GETS AWAY FROM YOU.

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:34.563
WHO PAYS SO THE INDUSTRIAL LAND

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:35.864
OWNERS THAT I REPRESENT MY

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:37.499
DISTRICT?

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:38.734
WHO WOULD LOVE TO USE THIS AS A

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:40.135
TOOL ARE AFRAID TO USE IT

01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:42.237
BECAUSE IF THE FIRE GETS AWAY

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:44.006
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.475
COST OF SUPPRESSION AND SO

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:48.644
THEY'RE RELUCTANT TO BE A? TO

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:49.211
PUT FIRE BACK ON THE GROUND

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:50.412
NUMBER.

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:52.581
ONE NUMBER TWO IS THAT WE HAVE

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:53.782
AIR QUALITY STANDARDS IN

01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:55.384
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE REGULATED BY

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:57.720
THE AIRPORT WHICH THE WINDOWS OF

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.922
TIMES THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:00.723
WHAT WE CALL.

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:02.791
BURN DAY SWITZER DAYS THAT YOU

01:11:02.858 --> 01:11:04.426
ALLOW YOU TO BE ABLE TO BURN

01:11:04.493 --> 01:11:06.462
BECAUSE OF AIR QUALITY --

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:09.965
ARE REALLY NARROW BECAUSE WE VSP

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.333
PERFECT BASICALLY FOR YOU TO BE

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.468
ABLE.

01:11:12.534 --> 01:11:14.136
TO MEET AIR QUALITY STANDARDS

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:16.672
AND APPLY THE FIRE TO THE GROUND.

01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:18.273
AND SO THOSE ARE TWO HURDLES

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.908
THAT WILL BE FACED IN ANY PIECE

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:21.343
OF LEGISLATION THAT SAYS WE'RE

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.012
GOING TO INTRODUCE FIRE --

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:25.447
BACK IN OUR ECOSYSTEM AND THEN I

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:27.349
HAVE ONE MORE COMMENT SO.

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:29.184
BEEF AND BEFORE WE INTRODUCE

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:31.353
FIRE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.589
MANAGING THE FUEL LOAD BEFORE WE

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.457
PUT FIRE BACK INTO IT OR WE JUST

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:37.192
TALK ABOUT PUTTING FIRE INTO IT

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:39.395
BEFORE WE'VE SAID AND OR DONE ME

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.796
SOME SORT OF THE MANAGEMENT BE

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:42.264
SO WE DON'T HAVE SUCH THE

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:49.438
INTENSITY OF FIRE.

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:51.040
I GREW UP I CAN MAKE SOME

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:52.775
COMMENTS ABOUT ALL THESE --

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:53.776
YOUR IDEA OF KIND ABOUT THE

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:54.677
LIABILITY IN THE CHALLENGES OF

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.445
PLAYING FIRE ON THE GROUND IT'S

01:11:56.512 --> 01:11:57.513
VERY VERY REAL.

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:58.647
IN ON THIS IS AGAIN WHERE I

01:11:58.714 --> 01:11:59.682
THINK WE CAN LOOK TO OUR

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:00.816
COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS IN THE

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:02.818
STATE OF FLORIDA.

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:03.452
BECAUSE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:04.520
THEY'VE ENACTED SOME LEGISLATION

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:05.854
THAT ALLOWS IF YOU HAVE A

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:06.455
PRESCRIBED FIRE PLAN HAS BEEN

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:07.423
WRITTEN.

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:08.724
HE GETS PEER REVIEWED BY THE

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:11.326
RIGHT PEOPLE FEEDBACK IS APPLIED.

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:12.795
AND THEN IT'S ACTUALLY ACCEPTED.

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:14.530
THEN IF THE PRESCRIBED BURNING

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:15.798
TEAM GOES OUT AND ACTUALLY

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:17.733
IMPLEMENTS THE FIRE AS PLANNED.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.501
WITH EVERYTHING IS.

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:21.370
TIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND THEN THEY

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:22.938
HAVE A PROBLEM WHICH INEVITABLY

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.039
YOU WILL.

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:25.274
I GUARANTEE IT I'VE HAD PROBLEMS

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.375
AND I'VE BEEN PRESCRIBED FIRES

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:29.712
I'VE BEEN PROBABLY HUNDRED MY

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:29.945
CAREER.

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:30.512
AND I HAD PROBLEMS SO THE

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:32.181
LEGISLATION IN FLORIDA THAN SAYS

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.816
THEM THERE ACTUALLY IS.

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:35.184
LIABILITY REFORM FOR THE PEOPLE

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:36.785
DOING THE WORK.

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.287
SO THERE'S NOT ON THEIR BACK IS

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:39.488
ACTUALLY THE STATE ACTUALLY FUND

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:41.924
THE LIABILITY PROCESS THAT IF

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.658
THE THING HAS BEEN.

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:44.727
PROBABLY PLAN IMPLEMENTED YOU

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:45.561
HAVEN'T DONE SOMETHING FOOLISH

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:47.963
CYCLE WHETHER SAYS THIS THE

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:49.264
WEATHER'S BAD I DO IT ANYWAY.

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:50.432
THEN YOU DON'T GET COVERAGE BUT

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.434
IF YOU DO IT PROPERLY IN STATE

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.802
OF FLORIDA'S BUDGET BEEN DOING

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:54.269
THIS FOR FIFTY YEARS.

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:56.338
AND IT REALLY HAS WORKED THE

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:57.339
QUESTION ABOUT YOU NO BURNING IN

01:12:57.406 --> 01:12:58.040
THINNING AND THINGS OF THAT

01:12:58.107 --> 01:13:00.209
NATURE INTERESTING ONE AND ALSO

01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:01.276
I THINK FOR ME.

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.778
YOU KNOW IT DEPENDS ON THE SIDE

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:03.412
OF COURSE WHICH JUST YOU COULD

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:05.047
DO SOME MECHANICAL WORK FIRST

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:05.647
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING TO GET

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:06.982
FIRED BACK THERE OTHER PLACES

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:08.984
CORSET YOU COULD MAYBE PUT FIRE

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:12.354
AND AT FIRST AND ACT TOGETHER.

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:13.922
YOU WORK AS LITTLE RISK YOUR

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:15.891
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE AS EASILY

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.259
OUTCOME YOU'RE NOT GONNA BUILD A

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.127
PRESCRIBED EXACTLY AS TIGHTLY

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:19.528
WHAT THE OUTCOME MIGHT BE

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:20.996
INTERESTING WERE TALLY.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:22.464
A BLODGETT FORCE WHICH I

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:23.465
MENTIONED WE'VE DONE PRESCRIBED

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:24.233
FIRES IN THE SAME GROUND OFFER

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:25.501
THREE TIMES IN TWENTY YEARS.

01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:27.002
AND WE'VE ALSO DONE MECHANICAL

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:27.903
THINNING BUT NO FIRE.

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:28.504
AND YOU CAN GO IN THERE AND

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:29.138
YOU'RE OUR DIFFERENCES YOU KNOW

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.739
THE THE FIRESIDE IS JUST A MORE

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:31.807
RANDOM --

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:33.575
MORTALITY PATCHES AND THINGS OF

01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:34.777
THAT NATURE SO I'VE ALWAYS FELT

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:37.146
THAT.

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:37.780
A PROBLEM IN THE SCALE IS SO

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:39.448
LARGE IN THE STATE I THINK YOU

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:40.949
TAKE ALL OF THE TREATMENTS THAT

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:42.084
ARE POSSIBLE.

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:42.718
AND YOU APPLY THEM AND YOU LET

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:46.321
THE MANAGERS ON THE CHOICE SO I

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:48.624
THINK ALL THOSE ARE VIABLE AND I

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:50.859
FOR ME THE MECHANICAL SIDE.

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:51.660
IN MY VIEW SOMETIMES PUBLIC

01:13:51.727 --> 01:13:53.095
DOESN'T GET DISCUSSED ENOUGH YOU

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.730
KNOW AND I IF WE GO TO BLODGETT

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:55.597
WE CAN LOOK AT PLACES THAT I'VE

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:56.498
BEEN THIN TWICE.

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:57.633
AND WE CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THE

01:13:57.699 --> 01:13:59.034
OUTCOMES OF THAT AND YES YOU CAN

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.302
DO SOME WORK IS NOT A COMPLETE

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:01.737
CIRCUIT FOR FIRE BUT IT CAN

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:03.205
ACTUALLY WORK AS WELL.

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.473
SO MY VIEW IS THESE THINGS HAVE

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.442
BEEN TRIED AND TESTED AND IT

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:08.177
REALLY DEPENDS AND I HAD TO TAKE

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.045
ONE OF THE METHODS OFF THE TABLE.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.747
A PRIORI AND THEN SAY WE'RE ALL

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:15.150
GOING TO USE THIS ARE ONLY GOING

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:15.784
TO USE THAT I FEEL THAT STEP BY

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:16.151
STEP [inaudible]

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:24.660
BACKWARDS --

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:26.128
SO I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.629
THINGS ONE THE HALF MILLION ACRE

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.832
IDEA COMES FROM A MALCOLM NORTH

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:33.802
PAPER FROM. NINE TWO THOUSAND

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:35.971
TWELVE THAT LOOKS AT THE

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:37.940
DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES AND

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.508
THEIR ASSOCIATED FIRE REGIME SO

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:40.609
THAT HE DIDN'T PULL IT OUT OF

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:41.777
THIN AIR WHAT'S.

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.579
THAT IS THE FUEL AND FIRE DEBT

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:46.248
WE LIVE WITH EVERY YEAR IN THIS

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.716
HERE IN OUR OWN BROWN IN THIS

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:48.050
HEARING ABOUT.

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:49.418
EVERY YEAR.

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:51.253
A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THOSE

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.788
ACRES ARE NOT.

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:53.922
ABSOLUTELY UNREACHABLE BY

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:55.524
MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT.

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:57.926
SO THEN WE ARE ALSO FACED WITH

01:14:57.993 --> 01:14:59.294
WHAT THE HECK DO WE DO IT.

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:00.829
AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF THOSE

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:02.331
ACRES ARE IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.466
WHERE WE CAN ESTABLISH EITHER A

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:05.667
NATURAL IGNITION USE IT FOR

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:06.835
BENEFIT WHEN ALL THE CONDITIONS

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.270
ARE RIGHT.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.038
ALL THE CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT.

01:15:10.105 --> 01:15:11.874
OR WE CAN USE FIRE THEIR PRO

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.876
ACTIVELY AND ACCEPT THE LOW IN

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:15.878
NYC SEVERITY RESULT WHICH WAS

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:16.745
THE NATURAL SYSTEM [inaudible]

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:19.948
FOR CENTURIES SO THERE'S THERE'S

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:21.450
CERTAINLY ISSUES WITH THAT LEVEL

01:15:21.516 --> 01:15:23.085
OF ACREAGE ARE WE STAFFED UP TO

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:24.820
DO IT DO WE GET THE AIR DAYS TO

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:25.420
DO IT.

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:26.822
WE GET A LOT OF AIR DAYS IN

01:15:26.889 --> 01:15:29.358
CALIFORNIA WE OFTEN DON'T WE GET

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:31.059
THEM SOMETIMES WHEN WE'RE YET

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:32.327
TRAINING LEARNING HOW TO PUT THE

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:33.495
FIRE OUT WHEN WE COULD BE OUT

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:35.030
BURNING.

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:35.697
HOW WE GET THERE ARE DAYS WHEN

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:37.733
THE FUELS ARE WAY TOO WET TO

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:39.601
EVER LIVE WITH A BLOWTORCH?

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:41.370
SO THAT THAT IS PART OF OUR FIRE

01:15:41.436 --> 01:15:42.337

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:45.207
ADDRESS THESE DIFFERENT BARRIERS.

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:47.009
AND THE NEAT THING IN CALIFORNIA

01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:48.610
IS THAT WE ARE.

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:50.445

01:15:57.853 --> 01:15:59.488
HARMFUL TO PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:00.989
AND EMISSIONS WHERE WE HAVE SOME

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:04.393

BUT WHEN WE HAVE THAT PLANNED

01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:09.665
OPPORTUNITY WE CAN DO A LOT

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:11.300
BETTER WITH FIRE SO THOSE ARE

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:12.935

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:54.102
IMPORTANT COROLLARY POINT HERE

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.703
IS.

OF THEIR FUELS REDUCTION PROGRAM.

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:10.038
HOW WE'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:11.339
THIS FROM THE FIRST DAYS OF OUR

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:12.941
TIME HERE?

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:14.776
AND WHEN WE WALKED IN THE DOOR

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:17.078
THERE WERE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:19.447
OF CHOICES TO EXCLUDE FIRE FROM

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:20.882
THE LANDSCAPE AND ALLOW WILD

01:20:20.949 --> 01:20:23.418
FIRE FUEL TO ACCUMULATE.

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:24.719
OF FIRE IN THE STATE IS NON

01:20:24.786 --> 01:20:26.721
NEGOTIABLE IT'S PART OF OUR

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:28.323
ECOSYSTEM AND EITHER WE MANAGE

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:30.625
OUR FORCE FOR LOW INTENSITY FIRE.

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.160
OR WE EXPERIENCE LARGER AND

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:33.995
LARGER FIRES.

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:35.764
WILDFIRE THREAT IS A COMBINATION

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:38.300
OF THREE FACTORS.

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:40.001
FUEL TEMPERATURE AND WIND AND

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:41.836
IGNITION.

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:43.605
AS OUR CLIMATE WARMS TO FUEL

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.040
CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND AND

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:47.275
INCREASING WARM SPELLS GREAT

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:48.577
OPPORTUNITY FOR FIRE.

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.278
AND AS OUR STATE'S POPULATION

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.480
GROWS THE IGNITION OPPORTUNITIES

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:53.448
GROW.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.817
ON AVERAGE 95% OF FIRES IN

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:57.352
CALIFORNIA ARE CAUSED BY SOME

01:20:57.419 --> 01:21:00.121
FORM OF HUMAN ACTIVITY.

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:01.223
WE SEE EVIDENCE OF THESE

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:02.457
CHANGING FACTORS IN THE LENGTH

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.159
OF THE FIRE SEIZE.

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:06.761
OVER THE PAST GENERATION OUR

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:08.463
FIRE SEASON HAS GROWN AT THE

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.565
FRONT END BY ROUGHLY THIRTY DAYS

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:13.068
AND AT THE BACK AND HAS EXTENDED

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:14.502
BY ROUGHLY THIRTY DATES.

01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:15.704
WE RECOMMENDED TO THE

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.572
LEGISLATURE AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:20.508
APPROVED LAST YEAR A CHANGE IN

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:21.910
OUR FIRE BUDGETING SYSTEM THAT

01:21:21.977 --> 01:21:24.679
RECOGNIZES THIS CHANGE.

01:21:24.746 --> 01:21:26.381
IT'S IT RECOGNIZES A BASE

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:28.750
BUDGETING THAT WAS BASED ON WHAT

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:31.386
IS NOW OUR FIRE SEASON NOT ON

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:34.289
WHAT USED TO BE OUR FIRE SEASON.

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:35.757
AND AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE THE

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:37.592
GOVERNOR HAD ON OUR CURRENT FIRE

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:40.095
SITUATION THE WEEK BEFORE LAST.

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:41.429
DIRECTOR PAM WHAT STATED THAT

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:42.597
HIS DEPARTMENT USED TO

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:44.733
EXPERIENCE ONE BIG FIRE OF

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:46.868
NINETY THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR.

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:48.403
WE HAVE HAD FIVE SUCH FIRES THUS

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:50.205
FAR THIS YEAR INCLUDING THE

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:51.339
BIGGEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:53.275
HISTORY.

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:54.576
AND WE'RE BUT HALFWAY THROUGH

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:56.711
THE FIRE SEASON.

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:58.046
THESE FIRES OF LED TO

01:21:58.113 --> 01:21:59.881
DEVASTATING IMPACTS TO LIFE

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:01.683
PROPERTY IN ECOSYSTEMS.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.518
ARE AND IT DOES ALSO HAVE LARGER

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:04.986
IMPACTS TO THOSE OF US THAT

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:06.655

01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:07.989
FIRE ZONE.

01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:10.125
WHETHER IT'S SMOKE IN THE AIR WE

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:11.760

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:18.166
AND IN THE NAPA VALLEY IN BIG

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:20.302
SUR COAST IN RECENT YEARS.

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:22.437
IN MAY THE GOVERNOR TOOK MAJOR

TO FIRE PREVENTION.

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:27.275
BY ISSUING AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:29.811
WITH FIRE PREVENTION ACTIONS.

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:31.346
APPROVING A FORCE CARBON PLAN IS

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:32.847
A ROADMAP.

01:22:32.914 --> 01:22:35.016
INCREASING BUDGET ALLOCATIONS

01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:41.723
TO LEAD ON THESE ISSUES.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.391
OF THE LEGISLATURE FOLLOWED SUIT

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:46.127
BY APPROVING OF MOST OF THESE

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:47.629
RECOMMENDATIONS IN JAIL ALL TALK

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:49.297
ABOUT HIM IN A MINUTE.

01:22:49.364 --> 01:22:50.231
BUT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.733
THERE WERE SOME ACTIONS TAKEN

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.202
AND PRECEDING YEARS --

01:22:54.269 --> 01:22:56.671
* IT IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:57.405
ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR

01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:59.040
LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:00.108
NEGOTIATED.

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:02.477
A A. B. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO TO

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:04.112
FINALLY GET SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:06.014
FOR TIMBER REGULATION SO THAT

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:07.382
THAT WOULD MOVE.

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:08.083
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:10.919
FACED WRECK.

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:12.721
STATE THAT LED TO WORK ACROSS.

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:14.823
FATE THE STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.491
GOVERNMENTS TO PUT FORTH A PLAN

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:18.126
OF ACTION.

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:19.294
WE WORKED WITH YOU IN THE

01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.629
LEGISLATURE SUCCESSFULLY FUND

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:23.064
THOSE PRIORITIES OVER MULTIPLE

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:24.933
YEARS.

01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:26.334
AND WHEN WE STARTED THE

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:28.069
ADMINISTRATION HAD IT DE IN THE

01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:29.304
STATE OUT OF TWENTY SIX BILLION

01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:31.106
DOLLAR DEFICIT.

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:33.408
THAT MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT AND

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:34.876
THEN WHEN THE STATE RECOVERED

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.344
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN IN

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:38.646
TO BUDGET SEQUESTRATION.

01:23:38.713 --> 01:23:40.949
OF THAT THEN HAMPERED FEDERAL

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:43.218
EFFORTS IN THE FORESTS.

01:23:43.284 --> 01:23:46.521
AND CONGRESS FINALLY --

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:48.456
DEALT WITH THE ISSUE THAT

01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:49.657
FEDERAL FIREFIGHTING COSTS EAT

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:51.526
UP MANY FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:53.128
COULD HAVE GONE TO FORCE HEALTH.

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:55.497
BUT THAT SOLUTION DOES NOT BEGIN

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:58.066
UNTIL SEPTEMBER.

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:59.100

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:01.903
AGREEMENTS THAT ALLOW FEDERAL

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.772

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:06.441

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:37.998
THE STATE OBVIOUSLY SERIES IF HE

TO CALIFORNIA IN MANY WAYS AS

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:41.402
ITS PRIMARY WATERSHED RESTORE

01:35:41.469 --> 01:35:42.703
HALF THE STATE'S POOREST CARBON.

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:45.306
RECREATION AND SO ON SO AS WE

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:46.507
THINK ABOUT CARRYING OUT OUR

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:47.475
MISSION IN THAT REGION WERE

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:48.142

I'M COGNIZANT OF OF HOW WE HELP

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:51.545
ACHIEVE STATEWIDE OBJECTIVES AND

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:52.646
THAT'S A RULE THAT A REGIONAL

01:35:52.713 --> 01:35:55.649
CONSERVANCY CAN PLAY --

01:35:55.716 --> 01:35:57.051
AS WE ARE WE'VE BEEN AROUND

01:35:57.118 --> 01:35:57.618
THIRTEEN YEARS AND AS WE GET

01:35:57.685 --> 01:35:58.586
BETTER PROGRAM ON THE GROUND IT

01:35:58.652 --> 01:36:00.488
BECAME INCREASINGLY CLEAR TO US

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:01.856
THAT THAT REALLY ARE PROGRAM

01:36:01.922 --> 01:36:02.990
CENTERED ON THE IDEA CREATING

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:04.592
HEALTHY WATERSHEDS.

01:36:04.658 --> 01:36:05.793
HEALTHY FOREST HEALTHY

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:06.260
COMMUNITIES THEY WERE

01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:07.128
INTERLINKED --

01:36:07.194 --> 01:36:08.529
AND WE WERE WORKING OUR WAY

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:09.530
THROUGH THAT AND ALONG CAME

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:11.599
TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THE RIM FIRE.

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:13.067
AND THE RIMFIRE WAS WAS TRULY A

01:36:13.134 --> 01:36:14.201
GAME CHANGER I THINK FOR MANY OF

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:16.170
US LARGEST FIRE THE RECORDED

01:36:16.237 --> 01:36:18.272
HISTORY OF THE SIERRA NEVADA --

01:36:18.339 --> 01:36:20.741
IT BURNED AT SEVERITY IS THAT

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:22.309
THERE'S NO HISTORICAL RECORD FOR

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:23.711
PATCHES OF HIGH SEVERIT FIRE

01:36:23.777 --> 01:36:24.979
THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN.

01:36:25.045 --> 01:36:26.280
AND IT WAS I THINK A WAKE UP

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:28.449
CALL TO SAY THIS ISN'T NORMAL

01:36:28.516 --> 01:36:29.817
THIS IS NATURAL WHAT'S GOING ON

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:31.485
UNFORTUNATELY EVERY YEAR SINCE

01:36:31.552 --> 01:36:32.620
THEN WE CAN POINT TO SOMEWHERE

01:36:32.686 --> 01:36:33.087
IN THE STATE.

01:36:33.154 --> 01:36:34.355
WE'VE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:37.158
AND AND IT'S ALWAYS YOU IS YOU

01:36:37.224 --> 01:36:38.492
DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ANY

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:39.627
BEGIN TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT CAN

01:36:39.693 --> 01:36:40.761
WE DO ABOUT IT THE ONE THING IF

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:41.896
YOU KEEP COMING BACK.

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:42.730
TO HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT A LOT

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:45.399
WHICH OF THE FUEL AND WHETHER

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:47.401
THE FUEL AT THAT STE CALIFORNIAN

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:49.436
ONE FORMER ANOTHER AT 60% OF THE

01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:51.005
STATE IS COVERED BY --

01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:51.906
WOODY MATERIAL WHETHER THEIR

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:52.940
TREES ARE BRUSH WHATEVER THE

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:55.075
CASE MAY BE AT SOME POINT EVERY

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:56.810
YEAR I THINK THAT YOU CAN BACK

01:36:56.877 --> 01:36:57.344
ME UP ON THIS THEY BECOME

01:36:57.411 --> 01:36:58.345
FLAMMABLE.

01:36:58.412 --> 01:36:59.513
AND AND THE FUEL LOADS ARE A

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:01.215
COMMON DENOMINATOR SO REALLY

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:02.283
FOCUSING ON THAT'S SOMETHING WE

01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:03.817
CAN ADDRESS.

01:37:03.884 --> 01:37:04.552
YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL

01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:06.287
WITH CLIMATE ISSUES THE LONG

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:07.454
TERM WEATHER TOPOGRAPHY THOSE

01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:08.689
AND IGNITIONS WE DON'T HAVE AS

01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:09.924
MUCH CONTROL OVER.

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.959
SO WE BEGAN TO WORK WITH BUT A

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:13.394
NUMBER OF OUR PARTNERS --

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:14.695
YOU'RE AT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE DO

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:16.030
SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY IT'S NOT

01:37:16.096 --> 01:37:17.831
WORKING WE FORM THE SIERRA

01:37:17.898 --> 01:37:18.399
NEVADA WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:19.667
PROGRAM --

01:37:19.733 --> 01:37:20.968
OUR PRIMARY PART AT THE TIME WAS

01:37:21.035 --> 01:37:22.303
U. S. FOR SERVICE BUT WE

01:37:22.369 --> 01:37:23.304
CERTAINLY HAVE REACHED OUT TO

01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:24.338
OUR THEIR STATE AND FEDERAL

01:37:24.405 --> 01:37:25.506
AGENCY PARTNERS.

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:26.307
WE HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:37:26.373 --> 01:37:28.108
COMMUNITY INDUSTRY LOCAL

01:37:28.175 --> 01:37:29.109
GOVERNMENT CAN EVERYBODY IN

01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:29.910
BETWEEN.

01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:31.779
WE STARTED KIND OF SIMPLE

01:37:31.845 --> 01:37:33.547
PREMISE WHAT COULD WE AGREE UPON.

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:34.215
AND WE'VE GOT QUICKLY DID

01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:35.249
AGREEMENT THAT NOBODY WAS TOO

01:37:35.316 --> 01:37:36.884
HAPPY WITH THE PATH WE RUN SO WE

01:37:36.951 --> 01:37:38.152
BEGAN EXPLORING HOW WE BUILD

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:39.119
UPON AGREEMENTS.

01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:40.854
AND COME UP WITH A PROGRAM

01:37:40.921 --> 01:37:42.389
ACROSS THE REGION THAT'S GOOD OR

01:37:42.456 --> 01:37:43.724
ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:45.025
WE ALSO CAME PRETTY QUICKLY TO

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:47.094
THE CONCLUSION THAT --

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:49.296
TREAT TREATMENTS WORK.

01:37:49.363 --> 01:37:50.698
AND THERE'S REALLY NOT A BUDGET

01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:52.132
TOOLS IN THAT TO A BOXER'S

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:53.000
PRESCRIBE TO MANAGE FIRED YOU

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:54.268
FOR TALK ABOUT AND THERE'S

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:56.103
MECHANICAL TREATMENTS WHETHER

01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:56.737
THEY BE THINNING OR SUSTAINABLE

01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:58.105
HARVEST --

01:37:58.172 --> 01:37:59.740
THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR OUR GATE

01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:01.709
AND SO FIGURING OUT HOW TO PUT

01:38:01.775 --> 01:38:03.944
THAT OUT ANY PACE AND SCALE

01:38:04.011 --> 01:38:04.545
THAT'S GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE

01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:05.879
BECAME --

01:38:05.946 --> 01:38:06.981
OUR CHALLENGE UNDER THE

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:08.782
WATERSHED APPROVED PROGRAM BUT

01:38:08.849 --> 01:38:09.683
THE OTHER THING WE WERE NOTICING

01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:11.719
AS WE MET WITH FIRE OFFICIALS

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:14.822
AND SCIENTISTS AND SO ON IS --

01:38:14.888 --> 01:38:16.757
EVERY TIME WE THOUGHT WE'D.

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:17.358
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WORST CASE

01:38:17.424 --> 01:38:18.993
SCENARIO US.

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:21.362
REALITY KEPT LEAPFROGGING.

01:38:21.428 --> 01:38:22.830
WE KEPT GETTING WORSE AND WAITED

01:38:22.896 --> 01:38:24.365
MANY BRIEFINGS AFTER THE RIM

01:38:24.431 --> 01:38:25.499
FIRE KING FIRE AND SO ON WITH.

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:26.433
THE FIRE PEOPLE CENTER MODELS

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.935
COULDN'T PREDICT THIS BEHAVIOR

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:30.070
AND I THINK THAT I GET IS ONLY

01:38:30.137 --> 01:38:31.572
GETTING WORSE FOR US SO.

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:32.473
SO WE REALLY LOOKED AT HOW DO

01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:33.907
YOU WOULD YOU WOULD YOU DO ABOUT

01:38:33.974 --> 01:38:35.709
THIS AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED.

01:38:35.776 --> 01:38:37.311
FROM THAT EFFORT IS THERE REALLY

01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:38.646
ARE THREE THERE'S THREE PRETTY

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:40.180
SIMPLE --

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:41.148
THINGS WE NEED TO ADDRESS ONE IS

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:42.249
INVESTMENT A LOT'S BEEN TALKED

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:43.917
ABOUT THAT HAVING A STABLE LONG

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:45.786
TERM SOURCE OF FUNDING ALLOWS

01:38:45.853 --> 01:38:46.954
YOU TO BUILD PROGRAMS.

01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:48.489
OVER TIME TO GET TO THE PACE AND

01:38:48.555 --> 01:38:50.491
SCALE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:38:50.557 --> 01:38:52.493
WE ALL STRUGGLE WITH HIS --

01:38:52.559 --> 01:38:53.060
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT KIND OF

01:38:53.127 --> 01:38:53.994
STABILITY.

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:55.396
HOWEVER WE GOT A LOT OF MONEY IN

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:57.064
THE SYSTEM NOW IS THE SECRETARY

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:58.265
MENTIONED A LOT OF FUNDING THAT

01:38:58.332 --> 01:38:59.967
IS SHOWING UP ON THE SCENE.

01:39:00.034 --> 01:39:01.869
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS NOW WE NEED

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:02.436
TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE DO

01:39:02.503 --> 01:39:04.071
STRATEGIC HACKLEY SMART ABOUT

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:05.639
SPENDING THAT AND HOW DO WE

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:06.974
ACTUALLY MOVE LANDSCAPES TO A TO

01:39:07.041 --> 01:39:08.876
A STATE OF RESILIENCE.

01:39:08.942 --> 01:39:10.044
AND AND I WOULD SAY FOR FROM A

01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:11.812
LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE.

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:12.746
THINKING THROUGH HOW YOU

01:39:12.813 --> 01:39:13.947
ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS

01:39:14.014 --> 01:39:16.083
INAPPROPRIATE THEM AND YOU KNOW

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:16.684
SOMEBODY THINK IT'S IMPLEMENT

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:17.918
PROGRAMS.

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:19.153
NOT MAKING THE TO TO

01:39:19.219 --> 01:39:20.821
PRESCRIPTIVE NOT TARGETING ONE

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:23.057
LANDSCAPE OVER ANOTHER WE TRY TO

01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:23.724
LOOK AT THIS YEAR NEVADA MAPPING

01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:25.459
WE TRIED BUT THE THAT COLORBLIND

01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:26.994
GLASSES ON RIGHT.

01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:27.895
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S GREEN OR

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:29.563
YELLOW OR WHITE OR WHATEVER THE

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:31.198
OWNERSHIP AS IN THERE IS HOW DO

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:32.733
WE ADDRESS AT A LANDSCAPE SCALE

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.201
SO AGAIN LET'S.

01:39:34.268 --> 01:39:35.536
HOPE WE CAN BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT

01:39:35.602 --> 01:39:37.037
HOW WE GET PUT THOSE FUNDS OUT

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:38.138
THERE SO WE CAN DESTROY TEACHER

01:39:38.205 --> 01:39:39.306
COULD AWAY THAT.

01:39:39.373 --> 01:39:40.507
ACTUALLY MOVE LANDSCAPES TO

01:39:40.574 --> 01:39:42.576
POINT A RESILIENCE --

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:43.344
THE OTHER THE SECOND THEY WE

01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:44.211
FOCUSED ON WAS POLICY AND

01:39:44.278 --> 01:39:46.180
PROCESS INTO --

01:39:46.246 --> 01:39:47.181
AND THERE'S A LOT OF NEW WERE

01:39:47.247 --> 01:39:48.782
THE AIR QUALITY DISCUSSION AND

01:39:48.849 --> 01:39:50.184
AND AND USING A FIRE AND THAT'S

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:51.485
WHAT WE'RE MAKING A LOT OF

01:39:51.552 --> 01:39:52.086
PROGRESS AND STILL HAVE SOME

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:52.886
WAYS TO GO.

01:39:52.953 --> 01:39:54.655
BUT I THINK WE'RE SEEING A LOT

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:55.756
OF DISCUSSIONS WITH.

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:56.590
WITH AIR REGULATORS WHO ARE

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:58.892
REALIZING.

01:39:58.959 --> 01:40:00.227
WHAT WE'RE DOING OUT THERE ISN'T

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:01.528
WORKING SO WELL SO?

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:03.130
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO DO

01:40:03.197 --> 01:40:04.631
THAT WE HAVE A PROJECT IN THE

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:05.466
CENTRAL SIERRA.

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:06.533
THE TONGS INTERESTS HERE

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:08.068
INITIATIVE WHERE WE WERE REALLY

01:40:08.135 --> 01:40:09.470
TESTING NEW WAYS OF DOING

01:40:09.536 --> 01:40:11.138
BUSINESS AND AND CARRY OUT THE

01:40:11.205 --> 01:40:12.706
PROCESS ONE OF THE PROJECTS THE

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:13.974
NATURE CONSERVANCY.

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:15.909
THE NGOS ACTUALLY HIRED IN HIS

01:40:15.976 --> 01:40:16.643
OVERSEEING THE WORK OF THE

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:18.278
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANTS.

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:19.380
WHO PRODUCED THE OF OUR MIDDLE

01:40:19.446 --> 01:40:20.314
DOCUMENTS AT THE FEDERAL

01:40:20.381 --> 01:40:21.949
GOVERNMENT IN THE LOCAL AGENCY

01:40:22.015 --> 01:40:22.983
IN THIS CASE WILL APPROVE IT'S A?

01:40:23.050 --> 01:40:24.318
DIFFERENT WAY TO GO ABOUT IT BUT

01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:25.519
IT'S CREATING SOME CAPACITY THAT

01:40:25.586 --> 01:40:27.054
OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BE THERE SO.

01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:28.155
REALLY.

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:30.157
LOOKING AT PROCESSES ONE I WOULD

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:30.991
SUGGEST TO YOU MAY BE OFFERING

01:40:31.058 --> 01:40:32.860
IT AS A QUESTION SINCE I AM BUT

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:34.161
I WANT TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF MY

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:35.295
SECRETARY HERE --

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.930
BUT AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:40:36.997 --> 01:40:38.866
MAKES THE DECISION TO INVEST ON

01:40:38.932 --> 01:40:40.033
PROJECTS ON FEDERAL LAND THAT

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:42.002
HEAVY CLEAR BENEFIT TO THE

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:43.003
PEOPLE CALIFORNIA.

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:44.071
PROJECTS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:45.305
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS DOES

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:46.640
IT REALLY MAKE SENSE AS A

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:48.475
FUNDING AGENCY FOR US TO HAVE TO

01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:49.610
START OVER IN GO THROUGH THE

01:40:49.676 --> 01:40:50.577
SECRET PROCESS ON TOP OF THAT.

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:52.646
TO DO IT TWICE.

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:53.614
MANY OF US THINK THAT THAT'S

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.681
SOMETHING WE SHOULD REALLY BE

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:55.716
ASKING OURSELVES AT THEIR SUMMIT

01:40:55.783 --> 01:40:56.650
PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE CAN

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:58.051
BE THERE.

01:40:58.118 --> 01:40:59.186
THE FINAL THING WE PHONE HAVE

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:00.621
FOCUSED ON IT IS THE ONE WE WENT

01:41:00.687 --> 01:41:02.656
BACKWARDS ON QUITE FRANKLY.

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.091
IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE CHIEF

01:41:04.158 --> 01:41:05.225
PIMLOTT MATCHING AND THE

01:41:05.292 --> 01:41:06.460
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR US IS NOT

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:08.162
JUST MILLS AND BIOMASS

01:41:08.228 --> 01:41:09.196
FACILITIES AND BIOENERGY

01:41:09.263 --> 01:41:10.631
FACILITIES BUT THE PEOPLE THAT

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:12.933
CAN DO THE WORK IN THE FIELD.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.067
THE MACHINERY THE EQUIPMENT.

01:41:14.134 --> 01:41:15.469
TRUCK DRIVERS IT IT'S GOING TO

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:16.770
TAKE ALL OF THAT TO GET TO THE

01:41:16.837 --> 01:41:17.905
PACE AND SCALE THAT WE JUST

01:41:17.971 --> 01:41:19.239
HEARD DESCRIBED AND SO.

01:41:19.306 --> 01:41:20.941
HOW DO WE REALLY HONESTLY TAKE

01:41:21.008 --> 01:41:22.709
ON THE ISSUE OF CREATING THAT

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:24.645
INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:41:24.711 --> 01:41:25.412
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:26.680
POINT IN BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:28.081
A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT.

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:30.184
THINGS LIKE BIOMASS ENERGY --

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:31.952
THE THE LEAST ENVIRONMENTALLY

01:41:32.019 --> 01:41:33.253
FRIENDLY THING FOR US TO BE

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:35.189
DOING IS REMOVING THE FUEL FROM

01:41:35.255 --> 01:41:36.790
THE FROM THE FOREST PUTTING INTO

01:41:36.857 --> 01:41:39.326
PILES AND BURNING IT FOR WORSHIP.

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:40.127
ALLOWED TO BRING IN WELFARE

01:41:40.194 --> 01:41:42.162
FIRES PUTTING IT IN FACILITIES

01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:43.397
THAT CAN MAKE ENERGY OF IT.

01:41:43.464 --> 01:41:44.531
WHILE THEY HAVE SOME EMISSIONS

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:46.099
ARE STRONG MAGICALLY IMPROVEMENT

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:47.835
OVER WHAT HAPPENS OUT THERE IS

01:41:47.901 --> 01:41:49.369
THE ALTERNATIVE AND YOU KNOW

01:41:49.436 --> 01:41:50.304
WE'RE KIND OF FACED I THINK THE

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:51.872
SECRETARY SAY IT'S IT'S

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:52.573
INEVITABLE.

01:41:52.639 --> 01:41:53.807
GONNA BURN ONE WAY THE OTHER AND

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:54.608
AND WE THINK WE'VE GOT A PRETTY

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:56.043
GOOD APPROACH TO TRY TO ADDRESS

01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:58.512
THAT SO FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN

01:41:58.579 --> 01:42:00.347
ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE.

01:42:00.414 --> 01:42:01.548
KEEPING WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE

01:42:01.615 --> 01:42:02.983
I'M IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:04.084
BUT CERTAINLY BUILDING UPON IT

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:04.852
CREATING IN.

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:06.386
A WORK FORCE TO DO THE WORK OF

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:08.088
CREATING PLACE OUTLETS THE OTHER

01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:09.056
THING I WOULD SAY IS A LOT OF

01:42:09.122 --> 01:42:12.593
THAT MATERIAL THAT NEEDS TO REAP

01:42:12.659 --> 01:42:14.828
BE REMOVED AND FIRES.

01:42:14.895 --> 01:42:16.063
ASCRIBE FIRE WILL DO A LOT OF

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:17.498
GOOD FOR US A LOT OF PLACES BUT

01:42:17.564 --> 01:42:18.131
MISTER DALEY'S POINT WE HAVE TO

01:42:18.198 --> 01:42:18.565
DO.

01:42:18.632 --> 01:42:21.201
MANAGEMENT IN MANY PLACES BEFORE

01:42:21.268 --> 01:42:22.769
THAT'S A LOT OF THE TRUE THIS IS

01:42:22.836 --> 01:42:24.905
OF NO VALUE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A

01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:25.539
PLACE TO TAKE IT NOBODY'S GOING

01:42:25.606 --> 01:42:26.573
TO PAY.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.374
FOR SO IT MAKES ALL THOSE

01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:29.409
PROJECTS READY SO CREATING

01:42:29.476 --> 01:42:31.411
OPPORTUNITIES TO TO TAKE THE

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:32.713
MATERIAL CREATE MEANS WE CAN GET

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:34.348
MORE WORK DONE IN THOSE THREE

01:42:34.414 --> 01:42:35.649
THINGS ALL ADD UP TO ACTUALLY

01:42:35.716 --> 01:42:36.850
GETTING.

01:42:36.917 --> 01:42:37.851
TO THE PACE AND SCALE OF

01:42:37.918 --> 01:42:39.720
RESTORATION --

01:42:39.786 --> 01:42:41.488
I THINK AS I SAY WE GOT GREAT

01:42:41.555 --> 01:42:42.623
PARTNERS THAT ARE DOING GREAT

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:44.224
WORK IN OUR REGION --

01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:45.425
CAL FIRE HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS

01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:46.960
IN IN AWARDING SOME OF THEIR

01:42:47.027 --> 01:42:49.363
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS --

01:42:49.429 --> 01:42:50.964
IN A PLACE THAT I MENTIONED

01:42:51.031 --> 01:42:51.565
EARLIER THE TALLEST INTEREST

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:53.033
SIERRA AREA WHICH WILL REALLY

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:54.334
FOCUSED ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:42:54.401 --> 01:42:55.602
HOW YOU DO YOU NEED.

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:58.872
BUSINESS DIFFERENTLY --

01:42:58.939 --> 01:42:59.506
AND I GO BACK TO COLLEGE I THINK

01:42:59.573 --> 01:43:01.608
IT WAS. TO STEVEN'S IT TALK

01:43:01.675 --> 01:43:02.242
ABOUT THE NEW NORMAL RIGHT AND

01:43:02.309 --> 01:43:03.277
WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING DOWN

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:04.378
WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE CLIMATE

01:43:04.444 --> 01:43:06.647
CHANGE PROJECTIONS AND WHAT

01:43:06.713 --> 01:43:07.214
COULD BE HAPPENING IN A FEW

01:43:07.281 --> 01:43:09.283
DECADES AND WE MAY ACTUALLY

01:43:09.349 --> 01:43:10.417
YEARNED.

01:43:10.484 --> 01:43:11.385
FOR THE DAYS OF TODAY BECAUSE IT

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:12.886
CAN GET A LOT WORSE AND IF WE

01:43:12.953 --> 01:43:16.023
DON'T CHANGE OUR PATH.

01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:17.090
IF WE DON'T IT'S HEADED SO WITH

01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:19.293
THAT.

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:19.826
HOME CONCLUDED HAPPY DANCE

01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:21.094
QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

01:43:21.161 --> 01:43:25.032
QUESTIONS.

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:27.034
ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAHLE OVERSAW ONE

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.001
THINK ALL THREE OF YOU AND

01:43:28.068 --> 01:43:29.169
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NOT TO KNOWN

01:43:29.236 --> 01:43:30.370
YOU GUYS ALL TOO WELL THROUGH

01:43:30.437 --> 01:43:32.372
THIS PROCESS OF I'M TRYING TO

01:43:32.439 --> 01:43:34.007
COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS OF VERY

01:43:34.074 --> 01:43:35.275
DIFFICULT.

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:37.311
AND CHALLENGING TIMES THAT WE

01:43:37.377 --> 01:43:38.912
FACE -- SO

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:40.647
AS AS YOU MENTIONED AND JAM WITH

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:42.816
THAT IS IN WATERSHEDS THEIR

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:44.685
IMPAIRED AFTER THE FIRE IN THE

01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:45.852
RECONSTRUCTION HAS TO GO ON

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:46.520
THERE.

01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:48.422
AND THE IT I THINK WAS A VAMPIRE

01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:49.523
THAT WE REALIZE THAT IT ACTUALLY

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:51.258
STERILIZE THE GROUND IN THEIR

01:43:51.325 --> 01:43:53.427
THEIR THERE WILL BE NO LIFE

01:43:53.493 --> 01:43:55.529
THERE FOR SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE.

01:43:55.596 --> 01:43:56.897
SO AND I HOPE SO THE GUESS THE

01:43:56.964 --> 01:44:00.634
QUESTION IS. TO BOTH YOU AND TO

01:44:00.701 --> 01:44:01.335
TPN LAW.

01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:04.137
IS THAT THE NUMBER ONE FACTOR WE

01:44:04.204 --> 01:44:05.339
HAVE IF WE REDUCE THE FUEL

01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:07.774
PERIOD.

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:09.509
THE FIRES ARE IS AS INTENSE SO

01:44:09.576 --> 01:44:10.444
THAT THAT'S THE GOAL OF THE

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:12.379
LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:13.280
A WAY TO REDUCE THAT FEEL NOW

01:44:13.347 --> 01:44:13.847
THAT.

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:15.182
THE THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:17.684
OF ALL THE REASONS THAT ARE.

01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:18.218
THAT'S HARD TO DO BECAUSE

01:44:18.285 --> 01:44:18.685
THERE'S NO VALUE IN.

01:44:18.752 --> 01:44:20.487
MOST THAT FUEL.

01:44:20.554 --> 01:44:24.458
SO WE'VE DONE --

01:44:24.524 --> 01:44:25.826
MYSELF AND MANY OTHER MEMBERS OF

01:44:25.892 --> 01:44:27.160
RAN LEGISLATION THIS FORCED

01:44:27.227 --> 01:44:29.596
PEOPLE OF TO BASE THE BY ENERGY

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:32.132
THIS PRODUCED FROM BIOMASS. TO

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:33.166
HAVE A PLACE TO OUTLET THAT

01:44:33.233 --> 01:44:34.968
THESE DRIVES THE COST DOWN A

01:44:35.035 --> 01:44:36.169
LITTLE BIT AND AND EXPENSE

01:44:36.236 --> 01:44:38.038
ACOSTA RESULT THE WATERSHEDS OF

01:44:38.105 --> 01:44:38.972
CALIFORNIA.

01:44:39.039 --> 01:44:40.474
THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION OF THE

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:41.775
FORCE THAT THEY GET THE BENEFIT

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:43.276
FROM FROM.

01:44:43.343 --> 01:44:46.146
THAT BIOMASS FACILITY SO YOU

01:44:46.213 --> 01:44:46.713
MENTIONED ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:48.215
REGULATORY.

01:44:48.281 --> 01:44:50.150
STREAMLINING THERE IS TALK ABOUT

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:51.418
AND I THINK MAYBE THAT THERE IS

01:44:51.485 --> 01:44:52.986
THERE SOME OPPORTUNITIES OTHER

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:54.755
THAN JUST THE DUPLICATION OF

01:44:54.821 --> 01:44:56.089
NEPAD SEEK WERE.

01:44:56.156 --> 01:44:57.791
THAT YOU SEE --

01:44:57.858 --> 01:44:59.326
THIS LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE A

01:44:59.393 --> 01:45:01.128
LOOK AT TO MAYBE A STREAMLINED

01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:02.329
THE PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN

01:45:02.396 --> 01:45:04.831
ACTUALLY DO LOWER THE COST WE

01:45:04.898 --> 01:45:06.400
CAN TREAT MORE ACRES.

01:45:06.466 --> 01:45:10.771
IN THE END [inaudible]

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:14.841
ALRIGHT SIX A JUST A THEY GO FOR

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:16.510
IT SOME GOOD COVERAGE --

01:45:16.576 --> 01:45:21.348
IS RETIRING ON THE FIRST.

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:41.835
I TRIED IT --

01:45:41.902 --> 01:45:44.237
IDENTIFY IMPACTS MINIMIZE

01:45:44.304 --> 01:45:47.774

01:45:52.813 --> 01:45:53.980
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS SO.

01:45:54.047 --> 01:45:55.282
HOW DO WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT

01:45:55.348 --> 01:45:56.750

01:46:00.987 --> 01:46:02.022
BROADER OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:03.957
STREAMLINE PROCESSES FOR THINGS

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:04.958
LIKE PRESCRIBED FIRE.

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:06.259
IT FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE TRULY

01:46:06.326 --> 01:46:07.828
RESTORATIVE IN NATURE SHOULD

01:46:07.894 --> 01:46:08.862
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME

01:46:08.929 --> 01:46:10.664
PROCESS OF OF OTHER PROJECTS

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:11.398
THAT.

01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:12.032
YOU KNOW COULD HAVE FAR GREATER

01:46:12.099 --> 01:46:13.800
IMPACT THAN I THINK YOU KNOW

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:15.869
THAT ON I'M TERMS OF THE ACTUAL

01:46:15.936 --> 01:46:17.003
WORK ON THE GROUND WE HAVE

01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:18.605
PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES. TO

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:20.941
IMPROVE THE PROCESS --

01:46:21.007 --> 01:46:22.542
MAKE IT SIMPLER MAKE IT LESS

01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:24.444
COSTLY BUT ENSURE THAT IN THE

01:46:24.511 --> 01:46:25.278
END WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT.

01:46:25.345 --> 01:46:27.748
PROTECT THE RESOURCE --

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:29.082
BECAUSE AGAIN YOU KNOW THE THE

01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:30.117
INACTION IS OFTEN THAT THE

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:31.952
GREATER.

01:46:32.018 --> 01:46:33.954
PURPOSE FIGHT GREATER RISK THAN

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:34.921
WHATEVER ACTIONS MIGHT BE

01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:36.923
PROPOSING AYE I THINK THE THE

01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:38.825
OTHER THING I WOULD SAY ON THE

01:46:38.892 --> 01:46:39.860
ON THE BIOMASS IN.

01:46:39.926 --> 01:46:42.329
ISSUE IN PARTICULAR IS --

01:46:42.395 --> 01:46:44.798
THE PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE SO CLEAR.

01:46:44.865 --> 01:46:45.398
RIGHT I MEAN WE'RE SPENDING I

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:46.767
DON'T YOU KNOW.

01:46:46.833 --> 01:46:48.735
CHIEF BUDGET ON FIRE SUPPRESSION

01:46:48.802 --> 01:46:50.704
THE COST OF EMERGENCY ROOM

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:51.938
VISITS WHEN READING THIS AIR

01:46:52.005 --> 01:46:53.607
THERE ARE A LOT OF CUT COSTS

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:55.575
ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT'S GOING OUT

01:46:55.642 --> 01:46:56.176
THERE AND THEN FOR SOME WHILE

01:46:56.243 --> 01:46:56.643
LANCE NOW.

01:46:56.710 --> 01:46:58.645
THERE'S A PUBLIC BENEFIT AND WE

01:46:58.712 --> 01:46:59.946
OUGHT TO BE WILLING TO INVEST

01:47:00.013 --> 01:47:02.282
FUNDS TO TO GET IT FACILITIES UP

01:47:02.349 --> 01:47:03.216
AND RUNNING TO GET THE WORK

01:47:03.283 --> 01:47:04.317
FORCE TRAIN AND PUT.

01:47:04.384 --> 01:47:05.619
PEOPLE ON THE GROUND I I THINK

01:47:05.685 --> 01:47:07.420
IT'S A LEGITIMATE PUBLIC

01:47:07.487 --> 01:47:08.622
INVESTMENT AND IN WHICH YOU KNOW

01:47:08.688 --> 01:47:10.223
WHAT WE SHOULD BE AFRAID TO TO

01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:11.391
DO THAT I THINK.

01:47:11.458 --> 01:47:12.259
CREATING SOME OF THOSE

01:47:12.325 --> 01:47:14.361
INCENTIVES WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE

01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:15.529
US YOU KNOW A LOT OF SAID THE

01:47:15.595 --> 01:47:16.696
WORKING TO TRY TO GET SOME

01:47:16.763 --> 01:47:17.898
SMALLER SCALE.

01:47:17.964 --> 01:47:19.332
FACILITIES UP AND RUNNING --

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:21.802
WITHOUT MUCH SUCCESS AND YOU'VE

01:47:21.868 --> 01:47:22.636
DELIGHTED TO WORK TO KEEP THE

01:47:22.702 --> 01:47:24.137
EXISTING FACILITY SO I THINK

01:47:24.204 --> 01:47:26.807
THERE'S I THINK INVESTMENT COULD

01:47:26.873 --> 01:47:27.407
PLAY KEY ROLE ON ON THE ACTUAL

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:33.013
THE IT CONSTRUCTION PIECE.

01:47:33.079 --> 01:47:35.615
SENATE JACKSON THANK YOU --

01:47:35.682 --> 01:47:38.919

01:47:38.985 --> 01:47:40.787
I'M I'M KIND INTERESTED IF

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:42.055
SOMEONE COULD TALK ABOUT RECENT --

01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:44.524
NON SIERRA FUEL REDUCTION

01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:45.926
PROJECTS YOU KNOW THE SOUTHERN

01:47:45.992 --> 01:47:47.661
CALIFORNIA'S.

01:47:47.727 --> 01:47:49.496
MUCH HAS A MUCH DIFFERENT

01:47:49.563 --> 01:47:51.898
VEGETATION SYSTEM AND WE DEAL

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:53.233
MORE IN CHAPARRAL RATHER THAN IN

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:56.002
THE BIG --

01:47:56.069 --> 01:47:58.972
TIMBER AND TREAT.

01:47:59.039 --> 01:48:02.242
CONCEPT WE HAVE GRASSLANDS SO

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:05.245
MIXED OAK AND PINE IN --

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:06.546
THE CHAPARRAL IN SOUTHERN

01:48:06.613 --> 01:48:07.280
CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIFFERENT

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:08.748
FROM.

01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:10.350
WHAT EXISTS IN NORTHERN

01:48:10.417 --> 01:48:11.651
CALIFORNIA AND?

01:48:11.718 --> 01:48:13.153
MOST OF THOSE FIRES IN THE

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:15.355
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA REALLY

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:16.957
ARE.

01:48:17.023 --> 01:48:17.123
UM.

01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:18.391
DIRECTLY.

01:48:18.458 --> 01:48:20.427
AND SERIOUSLY IMPACTING OF HOMES

01:48:20.493 --> 01:48:22.462
GIVEN THE LOCATION OF COURSE.

01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:23.763
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT'S BEEN

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:25.031
THE SAME THING EVEN THOUGH THAT

01:48:25.098 --> 01:48:25.899
HASN'T HISTORICALLY BEEN THE

01:48:25.966 --> 01:48:28.668
ISSUE BUT THE CHAPARRAL ISSUES

01:48:28.735 --> 01:48:30.203
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND ARE

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:31.838
WE DOING FUEL TREATMENT IN THESE

01:48:31.905 --> 01:48:33.974
AREAS AS AGGRESSIVELY.

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:38.144
AS WE DOING THEM ELSEWHERE.

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:39.279
IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION CENTER

01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:40.213
IN OF AND OF COURSE I DID YEAH

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:42.315
I'VE OBVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE THE

01:48:42.382 --> 01:48:43.516
PROJECT --

01:48:43.583 --> 01:48:45.185
INCENTIVES INTO MOUNTAINS OF

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:46.653
RIVERSIDE WHICH IS A PERFECT

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:48.555
EXAMPLE OF WORKING IN BOTH THE

01:48:48.622 --> 01:48:50.156
CHAPARRAL.

01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:51.691
AND THE MIXED CONIFER FOREST

01:48:51.758 --> 01:48:53.026
OTHER COUNTIES HAVE BEEN VERY

01:48:53.093 --> 01:48:54.227
FORWARD.

01:48:54.294 --> 01:48:56.096
THINKING AND IN THEIR PROJECTS

01:48:56.162 --> 01:48:57.297
AND TRIP COUNTY --

01:48:57.364 --> 01:48:59.566
FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE

01:48:59.633 --> 01:49:01.101
PERFECT AREAS THAT WERE --

01:49:01.167 --> 01:49:03.103
WITHIN THE THOMAS FIRE FOOTPRINT

01:49:03.169 --> 01:49:04.537
WERE AREAS THAT WERE EITHER

01:49:04.604 --> 01:49:05.672
UNDER TREATMENT OR HAD BEEN

01:49:05.739 --> 01:49:07.040
PROPOSED --

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:08.909
FOR TREATMENT AND THE CHALLENGES

01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:10.510
ARE FINDING THE RIGHT WE CAN'T

01:49:10.577 --> 01:49:12.145
TREAT.

01:49:12.212 --> 01:49:13.580
ALL SIXTY MILLION ACRES OF THE

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:15.282
LANDSCAPE WHETHER IT'S BROKE

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:17.651
WOODLAND CHAPARRAL OR MEXICANA.

01:49:17.717 --> 01:49:19.386
FOR SO WE HAVE TO FIND THOSE KEY

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:21.254
AREAS TO TO MAXIMIZE OUR

01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:22.822
INVESTMENT AND PROTECTING

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:24.391
COMMUNITIES WHERE THOSE RIDGE

01:49:24.457 --> 01:49:26.927
LINES AND AREAS SURROUNDING --

01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:28.261
COMMUNITY WHERE WE CAN REDUCE

01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:29.696
FUEL LOADING PUTTING CRITICAL

01:49:29.763 --> 01:49:31.064
FUEL BREAKS THAT WE CAN USE FOR

01:49:31.131 --> 01:49:32.098
DEFENSIVE.

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:34.134
I PERIMETERS AROUND COMMUNITIES

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.635
I AREAS ALONG AT THE SANTA

BARBARA FRONT COUNTRY AND I KNOW

01:49:37.437 --> 01:49:38.738
THERE IS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:40.307
CHALLENGES AND FRUSTRATIONS --

01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:41.908
WITHIN SO EVEN SANTA BARBARA

01:49:41.975 --> 01:49:42.976
COUNTY ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO

01:49:43.043 --> 01:49:43.977
GET --

01:49:44.044 --> 01:49:45.512
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE TO DO

01:49:45.578 --> 01:49:46.813
SOME OF THESE PROJECTS THAT WE

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:47.948
HAVE TO CONTINUE.

01:49:48.014 --> 01:49:49.382
TO BE AT THE TABLE WORKING WITH

01:49:49.449 --> 01:49:51.017
THE STAKEHOLDERS --

01:49:51.084 --> 01:49:52.452
TO IDENTIFY WHERE THESE CRITICAL

01:49:52.519 --> 01:49:54.921
NEEDS ARE AND GET THOSE --

01:49:54.988 --> 01:49:56.423
ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO BUY IN.

01:49:56.489 --> 01:49:58.358
AGAIN IT'S NOT TREATING.

01:49:58.425 --> 01:49:59.092
YEAH.

01:49:59.159 --> 01:50:00.293
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ACRES

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.562
IT'S TREATING VERY KEY AREAS

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:03.897
WITH THESE URBAN INTERFACE

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:05.031
PROJECTS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO

01:50:05.098 --> 01:50:06.900
PROTECTING COMMUNITIES AND AND

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:07.801
THAT'S TRULY IN PARTICULAR

01:50:07.867 --> 01:50:09.569
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE KINDS OF

01:50:09.636 --> 01:50:10.136
PROJECTS WE'VE REALLY GOT TO

01:50:10.203 --> 01:50:12.472
FOCUS ON AND ARE WE DOING THAT

01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:13.773
OR WE JUST IN THE IT.

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:15.241
IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

01:50:15.308 --> 01:50:16.977
CONSIDERING.

01:50:17.043 --> 01:50:18.511
THAT KIND OF CLEARING WERE DOING

01:50:18.578 --> 01:50:20.480
IT BUT WE CAN DO MUCH MORE.

01:50:20.547 --> 01:50:21.281
WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE TO GET US

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:23.316
TO DO MUCH?

01:50:23.383 --> 01:50:24.284
WE NEED TO GET MORE PROJECTS

01:50:24.351 --> 01:50:25.986
APPROVED WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:50:26.052 --> 01:50:29.189
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT GETTING UP

01:50:29.255 --> 01:50:30.690
AS THAT JIM GRAHAM SAID IN.

01:50:30.757 --> 01:50:31.591
STREAMLINING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

01:50:31.658 --> 01:50:33.660
REVIEW PROCESSES WE NEED TO TAKE

01:50:33.727 --> 01:50:35.862
ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:50:35.929 --> 01:50:37.397
THAT EXIST AND WE NEED TO GET

01:50:37.464 --> 01:50:39.499
STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE AND

01:50:39.566 --> 01:50:39.799
AGREE -- TO

01:50:39.866 --> 01:50:42.435
THE THE CRITICAL NATURE OF

01:50:42.502 --> 01:50:44.537
PROJECTS THAT ARE --

01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:45.839
LIFE SAFETY COMMUNITY PROTECTION

01:50:45.905 --> 01:50:48.641
CRITICAL.

01:50:48.708 --> 01:50:51.845
AND WITH THAT IN MIND --

01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:53.480
YOU KNOW WE HAVE SEQUEL WE HAVE

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:55.148
NEAT BUN AND THEY ARE.

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:56.416
VERY DIFFERENT --

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:57.951
OR PARTICULARLY DIFFERENT TO THE

01:50:58.018 --> 01:51:00.153
EXTENT THAT UP --

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:03.056
SEQUEL REQUIRES MITIGATION IN NY

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:05.492
BUT DOESN'T AND I THINK THAT IS

01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:06.960
A CONCERN TO SOME AYE.

01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:08.561
I DO KNOW PR IS PUBLISHED A

01:51:08.628 --> 01:51:10.930
HANDBOOK ON HOW TO DO SEEK WHEN

01:51:10.997 --> 01:51:14.034
THE BUS SIMULTANEOUSLY ON IT IS

01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:15.368
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:16.903
IS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:18.038
IS SOMEWHERE WHERE.

01:51:18.104 --> 01:51:19.739
WE SHOULD BE GOING BECAUSE YOU

01:51:19.806 --> 01:51:22.976
MENTION IF WE WANT TO EXPEDITE I

01:51:23.043 --> 01:51:23.576

I WOULD EQUATE IT TO KNOW

01:58:39.846 --> 01:58:42.415
DIFFERENT THAN A STOP SIGN --

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:43.916
WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

01:58:43.983 --> 01:58:45.718
HAVE A PERSON YOU KNOW ON ON

OBVIOUSLY OUR RESPONSIBILITIES

01:59:01.167 --> 01:59:02.301

AT S RELATES TO THE VICTORY

01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:12.378
CLEARANCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN

01:59:12.445 --> 01:59:15.114
THE TREES AND THE LINES IS THAT

01:59:15.181 --> 01:59:16.148
PART OF WHAT YOU LOOK AT IT.

01:59:16.215 --> 01:59:17.884

01:59:31.831 --> 01:59:32.732
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD

01:59:32.798 --> 01:59:33.499
HAVE AND OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE A

01:59:33.566 --> 01:59:34.333

01:59:53.886 --> 01:59:54.687
THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:59:54.754 --> 01:59:56.689
IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHERE CAL FIRE

01:59:56.756 --> 01:59:58.224
MAY HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN

01:59:58.291 --> 02:00:00.660

02:00:09.535 --> 02:00:10.436
HELLFIRE DOES NOT HAVE THE

ACRES YOU'RE ANNUALLY AND TO

02:05:08.534 --> 02:05:09.602
CONTINUE TO COMBAT THIS

02:05:09.668 --> 02:05:10.870
INCREASING CHALLENGE OBVIOUSLY

02:05:10.936 --> 02:05:12.504
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO NEED. TO

02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:13.939
TO MEET OR EXCEED OUR FUNDING

02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:15.941
EVERY YEAR TO CONTINUE.

02:05:16.008 --> 02:05:17.042
TO MEET THIS INCREASING

02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:18.911
CHALLENGED SO YEAH SO MISTER

02:05:18.978 --> 02:05:20.379
MAYES ASK JUST IN MY HERE SO

02:05:20.446 --> 02:05:21.280
WHAT'S WHAT'S THE TOTAL NUMBER

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:22.815
YOU LISTEN A FEW DIFFERENT FUNDS

02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:23.682

YOU'RE GETTING WHAT'S THE TOTAL

02:05:24.516 --> 02:05:28.320
PER YEAR THAT YOU NEED.

02:05:28.387 --> 02:05:29.188
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY

02:05:29.255 --> 02:05:30.656
SIT DOWN WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND

02:05:30.723 --> 02:05:31.557
WORK ON THOSE OUR DISCUSSION

02:05:31.624 --> 02:05:32.892
DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION NOW

02:05:32.958 --> 02:05:33.392
I DON'T HAVE IT READILY

02:05:33.459 --> 02:05:36.795
AVAILABLE.

02:05:36.862 --> 02:05:38.430
IS IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW

02:05:38.497 --> 02:05:41.000
WHAT'S NECESSARY OR HOW HOW CAN

02:05:41.066 --> 02:05:42.768
IF WITH PART OF OUR SOLUTION IS

02:05:42.835 --> 02:05:44.737
A FUNDING COMPONENT WE DON'T

02:05:44.803 --> 02:05:45.471
KNOW THE ANSWER HOW HOW DO WE

02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:46.405
DEAL WITH THAT.

02:05:46.472 --> 02:05:48.307
I THINK IT MAY BE TO STEP IN AND

02:05:48.374 --> 02:05:49.708
ANSWER I THINK THAT IT'S THERE'S

02:05:49.775 --> 02:05:51.110
ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY

02:05:51.176 --> 02:05:52.411
MILLION THAT'S GOING TO ALL THE

02:05:52.478 --> 02:05:54.680
ACTIVITIES AND I THINK.

02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:55.981
HE IS THE THE CHIEF IS JUST.

02:05:56.048 --> 02:05:58.050
OF A KINDA CONCERNED ABOUT HOW

02:05:58.117 --> 02:05:59.018
THAT BREAKS OUT TO ANSWER YOUR

02:05:59.084 --> 02:06:01.053
QUESTION SO THERE'S THREE

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:01.820
HUNDRED TWENTY TOTAL MILLION

02:06:01.887 --> 02:06:02.988
DOLLARS THAT'S GOING FOR THE

02:06:03.055 --> 02:06:04.323
WHOLE RANGE.

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:07.626
OF OF FORCE PROGRAMS AND E. IN

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:08.727
OURS A QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU

02:06:08.794 --> 02:06:10.663
JUST TERM ALL OF PREVENTION WE

02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:12.131
CAN GET WE CAN WORK WITH THOSE

02:06:12.197 --> 02:06:13.999
NUMBERS AND GET THAT.

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:15.301
AND DE THAT DEFERRED THEIR

02:06:15.367 --> 02:06:17.236
ANSWERED YOUR QUESTIONS YOU CAN

02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:19.371
ALWAYS DO MORE.

02:06:19.438 --> 02:06:21.206
OF WE HAVE JUST DOUBLED WHAT WE

02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:22.841
ARE PROJECTING TO DO AND I'M

02:06:22.908 --> 02:06:24.009
GOING TO TRY.

02:06:24.076 --> 02:06:25.077
TO THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT

02:06:25.144 --> 02:06:26.879
METHODS THAT THE ALLOCATIONS BUT

02:06:26.946 --> 02:06:29.648
MADE MEET THAT GOAL.

02:06:29.715 --> 02:06:30.716
WELL AGAIN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE AS

02:06:30.783 --> 02:06:32.051
PART OF THE SOLUTION WE SHOULD

02:06:32.117 --> 02:06:33.652
HAVE PROPER FUNDING.

02:06:33.719 --> 02:06:35.354
WE SURE AND THE HECK DON'T KNOW

02:06:35.421 --> 02:06:36.889
WHAT THE PROPER FUNDING AS WE

02:06:36.956 --> 02:06:37.456
RELY ON THE PROFESSIONALS TO

02:06:37.523 --> 02:06:38.824
TELL US.

02:06:38.891 --> 02:06:40.225
IN A CONCERNS ME THAT IS NOT

02:06:40.292 --> 02:06:42.695
READILY AVAILABLE SO I HOPE THAT

02:06:42.761 --> 02:06:43.963
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN GET.

02:06:44.029 --> 02:06:45.197
SO THE WE LOOK AT A TALK A LONG

02:06:45.264 --> 02:06:46.265
TERM SOLUTION WE CAN PUT THAT

02:06:46.332 --> 02:06:48.667
FUNDED IN THEIR I STILL MORE

02:06:48.734 --> 02:06:49.535
QUESTIONS BUT MISTER MAYES WAS

02:06:49.601 --> 02:06:52.037
JUMPING ON THAT POINT.

02:06:52.104 --> 02:06:52.671
YEAH THIS IS A PUT THIS REALLY

02:06:52.738 --> 02:06:54.306
IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION BECAUSE

02:06:54.373 --> 02:06:56.842
IF WE WE KNOW THAT --

02:06:56.909 --> 02:06:58.477
WE HAVE TOO MUCH FUEL.

02:06:58.544 --> 02:06:59.378
AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A

02:06:59.445 --> 02:07:00.746
PROPERLY MANAGE WE KNOW THAT NOW

02:07:00.813 --> 02:07:01.880
WE KNOW THAT DURING THE LEAN

02:07:01.947 --> 02:07:04.049
TIMES THAT THERE WASN'T ENOUGH

02:07:04.116 --> 02:07:05.451
YOU CAN WE HAD TO CUT BACK. TO

02:07:05.517 --> 02:07:06.418
BEING VERY IMPORTANT TO US TO

02:07:06.485 --> 02:07:10.255
UNDER.

02:07:10.322 --> 02:07:12.658
THAT ALLOCATION SHOULD BE --

02:07:12.725 --> 02:07:14.093
NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT GOING

02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:16.228
FORWARD SO BE GREAT TO BE ABLE

02:07:16.295 --> 02:07:16.996
TO HAVE A PLAN I'M AND END UP

02:07:17.062 --> 02:07:18.197
AND I THINK WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT

02:07:18.263 --> 02:07:19.498
IS WHAT'S THE PLAN TO SOLVE THE

02:07:19.565 --> 02:07:20.866
PROBLEM HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED TO

02:07:20.933 --> 02:07:22.501
BE ABLE. TO TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:23.936
OVER.

02:07:24.003 --> 02:07:25.237
AND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE KNOW

02:07:25.304 --> 02:07:26.372
THE ONE THING THAT'S GOING ON

02:07:26.438 --> 02:07:28.040
AND I SORT OF CUT MY COMMENT

02:07:28.107 --> 02:07:29.608
SHORT BECAUSE OF THE LIMIT.

02:07:29.675 --> 02:07:32.244
IS THE THE FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK

02:07:32.311 --> 02:07:33.612
FORCE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:07:33.679 --> 02:07:35.881
ESTABLISHED IS REALLY EVERYBODY

02:07:35.948 --> 02:07:37.750
THAT NEEDS TO BE AT THE TABLE

02:07:37.816 --> 02:07:39.518
AND DIESEL IKANA QUESTIONS IT'S

02:07:39.585 --> 02:07:41.854
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ADDRESS.

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:43.088
OVER TIME.

02:07:43.155 --> 02:07:44.156
WE'VE TAKEN A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF

02:07:44.223 --> 02:07:45.724
MONEY WERE DOUBLING WHAT WE'RE

02:07:45.791 --> 02:07:47.626
DOING AND WE'RE DOING IT IN MANY

02:07:47.693 --> 02:07:49.094
DIFFERENT WAYS AND INCREASE

02:07:49.161 --> 02:07:50.462
WASTE AND WE'RE DONE BEFORE SO

02:07:50.529 --> 02:07:51.397
WE'LL GET TO FIVE HUNDRED

02:07:51.463 --> 02:07:52.531
THOUSAND ACRES.

02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:54.533
THE QUESTION IS IS WHETHER THERE

02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:55.367
ARE OTHER THINGS TO DO THAT

02:07:55.434 --> 02:07:57.036
WE'RE NOT DOING HOW MUCH MORE

02:07:57.102 --> 02:07:58.771
THEY COST.

02:07:58.837 --> 02:08:00.839
AND I THINK WE'RE HAVING FEDERAL

02:08:00.906 --> 02:08:01.774
GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.876
LOCAL GOVERNMENT PRIVATE LAND

02:08:03.942 --> 02:08:06.211
OWNERS NGOS EVERYBODY'S AROUND

02:08:06.278 --> 02:08:07.279
THE TABLE TO HAVE THAT

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:08.680
DISCUSSION AND THAT'S WHAT'S

02:08:08.747 --> 02:08:11.483
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:13.085
OKAY SO OF COUPLE QUESTIONS SO

02:08:13.152 --> 02:08:14.987
THAT CHIEF YOU MENTIONED THAT.

02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:16.255
THAT YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITHIN

02:08:16.321 --> 02:08:19.591
VITAL CLEARANCE CAN YOU DISCUSS

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:20.225
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:20.793
HAVING THE BILL WHO ARE THE

02:08:20.859 --> 02:08:24.096
PROBLEMS WITH.

02:08:24.163 --> 02:08:25.297
WELL IN THE CASE OF FOR EXAMPLE

02:08:25.364 --> 02:08:26.698
IN IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTERS

02:08:26.765 --> 02:08:28.167
CONCERNS ABOUT FIRE FREQUENCY

02:08:28.233 --> 02:08:30.235
WITHIN THE CHAPARRAL AND WORKING

02:08:30.302 --> 02:08:31.703
WITH THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES TO

02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:33.005
TO COME TO WHAT'S THE

02:08:33.072 --> 02:08:34.306
APPROPRIATE FIRE FREQUENCY

02:08:34.373 --> 02:08:35.441
BECAUSE THERE ARE THOSE THAT.

02:08:35.507 --> 02:08:36.675
THERE'S CONCERNS IT TOO MUCH

02:08:36.742 --> 02:08:37.810
FIRE OVER --

02:08:37.876 --> 02:08:40.012
SHORT INTERVALS CAN'T CHANGE

02:08:40.079 --> 02:08:40.712
THAT.

02:08:40.779 --> 02:08:41.647
YOU KNOW THEY GET EXOTICS OTHER

02:08:41.713 --> 02:08:43.382
SPECIES THAT WERE SITTING DOWN

02:08:43.449 --> 02:08:44.216
TO THE TABLE IN FRONT THE TERM

02:08:44.283 --> 02:08:46.819
HOW DO WE YOU COME TO SOME

02:08:46.885 --> 02:08:48.787
CONSENSUS ON WHAT THE RIGHT

02:08:48.854 --> 02:08:50.289
AMOUNT IS ABOUT THE SAME TIME.

02:08:50.355 --> 02:08:51.356
RECOGNIZING WE IF WE DON'T

02:08:51.423 --> 02:08:54.726
PROVIDE VERY FUEL MODIFICATIONS

02:08:54.793 --> 02:08:55.661
TO SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES

02:08:55.727 --> 02:08:57.396
THEY'RE GOING TO BURN.

02:08:57.463 --> 02:08:58.931
AND SO IT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S

02:08:58.997 --> 02:08:59.598
GOING BACK TO SOME OF THE OTHER

02:08:59.665 --> 02:09:01.033
QUESTIONS JUST EVEN WITHIN THE

02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:02.835
STATE FAMILY AND WE ARE LOOKING

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:04.336
AT EFFICIENCIES BETWEEN

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:05.804
ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR PERMITTING.

02:09:05.871 --> 02:09:07.306
AND A REVIEW PROCESS AND SUCH

02:09:07.372 --> 02:09:08.740
CIRCUMVENTING PROCESSES BUT IT'S

02:09:08.807 --> 02:09:10.542
LOOKING AT EFFICIENCIES AND HOW

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:12.311
WE CAN DO THINGS TOGETHER AND

02:09:12.377 --> 02:09:13.745
WORK TOWARDS SHORTENED TIME

02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:15.380
FRAMES OF APPROVALS.

02:09:15.447 --> 02:09:16.281
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET TO

02:09:16.348 --> 02:09:18.016
THE APPROVALS IT REALLY DEPENDS

02:09:18.083 --> 02:09:19.184
AT FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE WORKING

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:20.452
VERY HARD TO GET THE VEGETATION

02:09:20.519 --> 02:09:22.421
TREATMENT PROGRAM ENVIRONMENTAL

02:09:22.488 --> 02:09:24.223
IMPACT REPORT APPROVED --

02:09:24.289 --> 02:09:25.924
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A

02:09:25.991 --> 02:09:26.892
PROGRAMMATIC DOCUMENT TO GET.

02:09:26.959 --> 02:09:28.527
DID WE LOOK AT VERY SIMILAR

02:09:28.594 --> 02:09:29.862
PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE TO

02:09:29.928 --> 02:09:31.096
HAVE VERY SIMILAR KINDS OF

02:09:31.163 --> 02:09:31.663
TREATMENTS AND VERY SIMILAR

02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:33.098
IMPACTS.

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:33.932
ON THE GROUND AND WE'VE BEEN

02:09:33.999 --> 02:09:35.734
WORKING FOR NUMBER OF YEARS NOW

02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:36.535
TO HAVE THIS PROGRAMMATIC

02:09:36.602 --> 02:09:38.403
DOCUMENT APPROVED IN ITS.

02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:40.105
BEING REVIEWED WE'VE HAD OUT FOR

02:09:40.172 --> 02:09:41.540
PUBLIC COMMENT AND DOES THE

02:09:41.607 --> 02:09:43.542
KINDS OF TOOLS ARE VERY HELPFUL

02:09:43.609 --> 02:09:45.577
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE

02:09:45.644 --> 02:09:47.012
EFFICIENT IN GETTING THIS COMES

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:47.412
OUT WHEN YOU'RE.

02:09:47.479 --> 02:09:47.913
GOING TO HAVE A LARGER

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:49.815
PROGRAMMATIC DOCUMENT IT DOES TO

02:09:49.882 --> 02:09:51.550
SCIENCE AND FAX ACROSS THE

02:09:51.617 --> 02:09:53.452
BORDER CROSSED ISSUE AND WHEN

02:09:53.519 --> 02:09:55.821
YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC APPLICATION

02:09:55.888 --> 02:09:56.421
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT

02:09:56.488 --> 02:09:57.923
SPUR. TO THAT PARCEL OF LAND OR

02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.991
LANDSCAPE.

02:09:59.057 --> 02:10:00.559
BUT YOU HAVE THIS BASE OF

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:02.094
SCIENCE THAT'S BEEN DOCUMENTED

02:10:02.161 --> 02:10:03.996
APPROVED AND SIGNED OFF ON THAT

02:10:04.062 --> 02:10:05.597
YOU CAN USE AS PART OF THAT SO

02:10:05.664 --> 02:10:07.566
IT JUST MOVES YOU CLOSER TO THE

02:10:07.633 --> 02:10:09.468
OUTCOMES SURE HOW WAS IT TAKE.

02:10:09.535 --> 02:10:10.602
TO TO PREPARE THE DOCUMENT

02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:12.171
PROCESS IT THROUGH USED JUST

02:10:12.237 --> 02:10:13.639
TWELVE MONTHS EIGHTEEN MONTHS

02:10:13.705 --> 02:10:14.840
SIX MONTHS [inaudible]

02:10:14.907 --> 02:10:16.975
I YEARS.

02:10:17.042 --> 02:10:19.144
HERE S. BEST A PROGRAM AT WE

02:10:19.211 --> 02:10:21.046
ASSUME YOU CAN'T DO SPECIALIZED

02:10:21.113 --> 02:10:22.581
ENVIRONMENT DOCUMENTS ANTI DO

02:10:22.648 --> 02:10:24.249
THEM THOUGH THE LARGE ONE CUT IN

02:10:24.316 --> 02:10:25.184
INTEREST AS SECRETARY ALERTS AS

02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:26.852
A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO

02:10:26.919 --> 02:10:28.220
BUILDING THE PROGRAMMATIC DOCKET

02:10:28.287 --> 02:10:29.821
LOTS OF SCIENCE LOTS OF FEW

02:10:29.888 --> 02:10:32.157
BUILDING THE FOUNDATION AND THEN

02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:32.357
WHAT.

02:10:32.424 --> 02:10:33.325
YOU HAVE THAT DOCUMENT HE'S VERY

02:10:33.392 --> 02:10:34.893
SPECIFIC PROJECTS COMMAND THAT

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:36.528
FALL UNDER THAT YOU DON'T HAVE

02:10:36.595 --> 02:10:37.796
TO WHICH YOU CAN DO TO SPECIFIC

02:10:37.863 --> 02:10:38.363
PROJECTS NOT OF THE LARGER

02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:40.065
DOCUMENTS ON THE PROGRAMMATIC

02:10:40.132 --> 02:10:42.401
THING IS THE THING THAT YEARS.

02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:43.902
CIFRA PROJECTS OR MUCH BRIDGE

02:10:43.969 --> 02:10:45.537
ORDER WIDERSTAND BUT CAN YOU DO

02:10:45.604 --> 02:10:46.939
THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS INTO A

02:10:47.005 --> 02:10:48.106
LARGER DOCUMENT.

02:10:48.173 --> 02:10:50.509
YOU COULD YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO A

02:10:50.576 --> 02:10:51.543
LITTLE MORE SCIENCE OR LOAD MORE

02:10:51.610 --> 02:10:52.744
THINGS OR OTHERWISE CONTAINED IN

02:10:52.811 --> 02:10:55.380
THE LARGER DOCUMENT.

02:10:55.447 --> 02:10:56.615
SO HE DOESN'T HOLD IT OFF IT

02:10:56.682 --> 02:10:57.182
JUST MIGHT MAKE IT A LITTLE

02:10:57.249 --> 02:10:58.784
LONGER OKAY SO FEW DID A

02:10:58.850 --> 02:11:00.886
SPECIFIC DOCUMENT.

02:11:00.953 --> 02:11:02.221
I LOOK I KNOW WERE BE CAREFUL

02:11:02.287 --> 02:11:02.854
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT PROCESS I

02:11:02.921 --> 02:11:03.956
GET THAT.

02:11:04.022 --> 02:11:04.990
BUT AGAIN IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE

02:11:05.057 --> 02:11:06.391
A DECISION TO TRY TO SOLVE THE

02:11:06.458 --> 02:11:07.259
PROBLEM.

02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:08.560
WE HAVE TO KNOW THE FACT BUT I

02:11:08.627 --> 02:11:09.861
THINK THE REVERSE IS TRUE

02:11:09.928 --> 02:11:11.697
BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

02:11:11.763 --> 02:11:13.632
IS THAT TRYING TO USE THE LARGER

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:15.367
DOCUMENT TO FACILITATE PROJECTS

02:11:15.434 --> 02:11:17.135
AND MAKING THEM QUICKER SO THAT

02:11:17.202 --> 02:11:18.604
YOU GET OUT OF THE WAY WITH A

02:11:18.670 --> 02:11:20.038
LOT OF THE SCIENCE YOU HAVE

02:11:20.105 --> 02:11:21.573
CERTIFIED YOU HAVE DONE.

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.742
IT CAN BE USED AND PEOPLE DON'T

02:11:23.809 --> 02:11:26.044
HAVE TO REINVENT EVERYTHING WHEN

02:11:26.111 --> 02:11:28.046
THEY DO THE INDIVIDUAL YEAH BY I

02:11:28.113 --> 02:11:29.481
GUESS BECAUSE I GUESS PROCESS SO.

02:11:29.548 --> 02:11:31.383
SO COULD IT COULD TAKE YEARS TO

02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:31.950
GO THROUGH THAT THE LARGER

02:11:32.017 --> 02:11:32.818
DOCUMENT.

02:11:32.884 --> 02:11:34.186
IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S HELD UP IN

02:11:34.253 --> 02:11:37.289
COURT DO YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS

02:11:37.356 --> 02:11:39.091
IS THAT WHITE EXCELLENT KNOW

02:11:39.157 --> 02:11:39.658
IDEALLY YOU WANT TO BUILD A

02:11:39.725 --> 02:11:42.628
DOCUMENT THAT IT'S NOT THE AUDIT

02:11:42.694 --> 02:11:43.795
GIVEN DOES THAT HAPPEN THOUGH.

02:11:43.862 --> 02:11:44.463
CERTAINLY IT DOES AND SO ARE AYE

02:11:44.529 --> 02:11:45.664
WE WANT TO SURE WE HAVE A

02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:47.499
DOCUMENT THAT IS SOUND AND SOLID

02:11:47.566 --> 02:11:49.534
AND HAS THE GREATEST CONSENSUS

02:11:49.601 --> 02:11:50.502
OF THE STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED

02:11:50.569 --> 02:11:51.603
GOING BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROCESS

02:11:51.670 --> 02:11:54.106
FOR LARGE SCALE NBA NFL STADIUMS

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:55.274
AND A LOT FASTER.

02:11:55.340 --> 02:11:56.708
THAN WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT TRYING

02:11:56.775 --> 02:11:57.943
TO DO IT FOR SOME OF THESE

02:11:58.010 --> 02:12:00.145
PROCESSES WELL RIGHT.

02:12:00.212 --> 02:12:00.979
WHAT WERE ABOUT AGNOSTIC ON THAT

02:12:01.046 --> 02:12:14.359
ISSUE?

02:12:14.426 --> 02:12:15.594
SENATOR STONE I THINK YOU MISSED

02:12:15.661 --> 02:12:19.665
YOUR FIRST I WANT TO SAY --

YOUR ATTENTION --

02:12:26.138 --> 02:12:26.972
TO ALL THE FIRES IN THE STATE OF

02:12:27.039 --> 02:12:28.674
CALIFORNIA BUT IN PARTICULAR THE

02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:30.075
THE CRANSTON FIRE IN THE HOLY

02:12:30.142 --> 02:12:32.911
FIRE AND I KNOW MANY OF YOUR

02:12:32.978 --> 02:12:34.346
TROOPS ARE FRIENDS OF MINE THAT

02:12:34.413 --> 02:12:35.480
HAVE BEEN WORKING MANY MANY

02:12:35.547 --> 02:12:36.648
HOURS TO TRY TO PRESERVE

02:12:36.715 --> 02:12:38.450
PROPERTY IN LIFE AND I I WANT TO

02:12:38.517 --> 02:12:38.650
KNOW.

02:12:38.717 --> 02:12:39.718
HOW MUCH WE ALL APPRECIATE ALL

02:12:39.785 --> 02:12:42.688
ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS?

02:12:42.754 --> 02:12:43.655
I'M NOT GETTING TO THE MATTER OF

02:12:43.722 --> 02:12:44.856
HANDS CAN YOU TELL ME --

02:12:44.923 --> 02:12:46.658
LAST YEAR --

02:12:46.725 --> 02:12:48.026
HOW MANY ACRES OF PRESCRIBER

02:12:48.093 --> 02:12:49.695
EARNED IT CAL FIRE?

02:12:49.761 --> 02:12:51.997
ENTERTAIN INCOMPLETE.

02:12:52.064 --> 02:12:54.099
CALVET COMPLETED JUST OVER

02:12:54.166 --> 02:12:54.633
NINETEEN THOUSAND ACRES A

02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:56.702
BROADCAST PRESCRIPTION BURN OUT

02:12:56.768 --> 02:12:57.636
DURING THIS LAST FISCAL YEAR

02:12:57.703 --> 02:12:58.937
CONCLUDING I JUNE THIRTIETH.

02:12:59.004 --> 02:13:00.372
THAT'S UP.

02:13:00.439 --> 02:13:02.574
OF FROM ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND

02:13:02.641 --> 02:13:04.343
ACRES A FEW YEARS PRIOR.

02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:06.078
OKAY AND IT BUT YOU HAVE A GOAL

02:13:06.144 --> 02:13:09.948
OF MITIGATING IF YOU WELFARE

02:13:10.015 --> 02:13:11.216
PRESCRIBE BURNS AND IMPRESSION

02:13:11.283 --> 02:13:13.385
MANAGEMENT.

02:13:13.452 --> 02:13:13.985
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A

02:13:14.052 --> 02:13:15.354
YEAR SO.

02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:17.489
WERE A LONG WAYS OFF IT SEEMS

02:13:17.556 --> 02:13:19.091
LIKE TO ME THEN.

02:13:19.157 --> 02:13:20.392
AGAIN MAYBE THAT'S OR A RESOURCE

02:13:20.459 --> 02:13:24.629
ISSUE WHICH WE CERTAINLY --

02:13:24.696 --> 02:13:26.998
ONE KNOW ABOUT --

02:13:27.065 --> 02:13:28.433
ALSO.

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:29.401
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINNING OF

02:13:29.468 --> 02:13:29.968
FORCE WE'VE WE'VE NEGLECTED

02:13:30.035 --> 02:13:31.970
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR SO LONG

02:13:32.037 --> 02:13:33.105
AND WE TALK ABOUT PRESCRIBED

02:13:33.171 --> 02:13:33.839
BURNS YOU GOT TO BE EXTRA

02:13:33.905 --> 02:13:35.540
CAREFUL NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE

02:13:35.607 --> 02:13:36.641
SUCH DENSE VEGETATION

02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:36.942
[inaudible]

02:13:37.008 --> 02:13:42.647
AND LOCAL COMPANIES SIR --

02:13:42.714 --> 02:13:44.516
CAUTIOUS ABOUT PRESCRIBED BURNS

02:13:44.583 --> 02:13:46.385
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO DANCE NOW TO

02:13:46.451 --> 02:13:47.185
GET OUT OF CONTROL HAVING

02:13:47.252 --> 02:13:50.555
TROUBLE GETTING INSURANCE --

02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:52.524
WHAT WISDOM CAN YOU OFFER SOME

02:13:52.591 --> 02:13:53.959
OF THE SMALLER COMPANIES ABOUT

02:13:54.025 --> 02:13:55.127
HOW THEY CAN DO THIS PRESCRIBED

02:13:55.193 --> 02:13:56.762
BURNS AND HE'S VERY DANGEROUS

02:13:56.828 --> 02:13:58.697
CONDITIONS THAT?

02:13:58.764 --> 02:13:59.698
YOU HAVE UNDERTAKEN I ASSUME

02:13:59.765 --> 02:14:01.299
THAT UNDER THE NINETEEN THOUSAND

02:14:01.366 --> 02:14:03.368
ACRES INTO HAVE --

02:14:03.435 --> 02:14:05.971
PRESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR

02:14:06.037 --> 02:14:07.172
I ASSUME THAT NONE OF THEM GOT

02:14:07.239 --> 02:14:09.040
OUT OF CONTROL AND CREATED.

02:14:09.107 --> 02:14:13.044
A SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

02:14:13.111 --> 02:14:14.513
THERE IS ALWAYS RISK WITH

02:14:14.579 --> 02:14:15.981
PRESCRIBED BURNING I THINK IF

02:14:16.047 --> 02:14:17.082
YOU LOOK ACROSS THE NATION

02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:17.682
THERE'S ALWAYS THERE'S THERE'S

02:14:17.749 --> 02:14:18.784
AN INHERENT RISK IN PUTTING FIRE

02:14:18.850 --> 02:14:20.452
ON THE GROUND.

02:14:20.519 --> 02:14:21.953
BUT WE ALL DO COLLECT THE THOSE

02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:23.255
MITIGATING THAT RISK TO THE

02:14:23.321 --> 02:14:25.223
LOWEST POSSIBLE POINT IN THAT'S

02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:25.757
HEARD OF THAT DESCRIPTION

02:14:25.824 --> 02:14:27.993
EARLIER IT'S BURNING WHEN WE

02:14:28.059 --> 02:14:28.760
HAVE A PRESCRIPTION THAT'S WHEN

02:14:28.827 --> 02:14:29.928
THE WEATHER.

02:14:29.995 --> 02:14:31.696
THE FUEL CONDITIONS ARE ALL THAT

02:14:31.763 --> 02:14:33.231
ARE IN ALIGNMENT SO THAT IT

02:14:33.298 --> 02:14:34.666
MEETS THE PRESCRIPTION INTENSITY

02:14:34.733 --> 02:14:36.968
YOU WANT WHILE YOU SIGNIFICANTLY

02:14:37.035 --> 02:14:39.438
REDUCE YOUR RISK OF A SKATE.

02:14:39.504 --> 02:14:40.172
AND AS WE WORK THROUGH THESE

02:14:40.238 --> 02:14:41.640
DISCUSSIONS THAT DO THE ABILITY

02:14:41.706 --> 02:14:44.009
TO INCREASE IS GETTING EVERYONE

02:14:44.075 --> 02:14:45.744
MORE COMFORTABLE THAT WE AGAIN

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:47.045
YOU FOR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A

02:14:47.112 --> 02:14:48.413
CENTRALIZED APPROVAL AND

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:50.315
TRAINING PROCESS. FOR ALL THE

02:14:50.382 --> 02:14:51.917
BURNERS IN CALIFORNIA IF WE'RE

02:14:51.983 --> 02:14:54.319
GOING TO GET BEYOND CAL FIRES

02:14:54.386 --> 02:14:55.454
TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES AND AND

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:57.322
OTHERS WE NEED TO EXTEND AND

02:14:57.389 --> 02:14:58.690
LEVERAGE OUR ABILITY.

02:14:58.757 --> 02:15:00.559
TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS TO

02:15:00.625 --> 02:15:01.860
BRING MORE BUT WE HAVE TO

02:15:01.927 --> 02:15:03.094
OBVIOUSLY HAVE OUR PARTNERS MORE

02:15:03.161 --> 02:15:04.196
COMFORTABLE.

02:15:04.262 --> 02:15:06.131
WITH THE SHARED RISK AND IT

02:15:06.198 --> 02:15:07.098
CAN'T ALWAYS BE THE STATE

02:15:07.165 --> 02:15:08.800
ASSUMING A 100% OF THE

02:15:08.867 --> 02:15:10.202
RESPONSIBILITY.

02:15:10.268 --> 02:15:11.603
YOU KNOW FROM --

02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:13.104
FROM A POTENTIALLY NO ESCAPED

02:15:13.171 --> 02:15:14.773
BURN ABOUT THE SAME TIME WE

02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:15.774
CAN'T PUT ALL THAT ON THE BACKS

02:15:15.841 --> 02:15:17.576
OF OF THAT BURNER IF WE'RE EVER

02:15:17.642 --> 02:15:18.743
GOING TO HOPE TO INCREASE THE

02:15:18.810 --> 02:15:20.111
SPACE AND SCALE SO IT.

02:15:20.178 --> 02:15:21.146
IT'S A TOUGH QUESTION IT'S A

02:15:21.213 --> 02:15:22.614
HARD QUESTION AND IT'S TAKEN US

02:15:22.681 --> 02:15:24.216
A LONG TIME TO GET HERE BUT

02:15:24.282 --> 02:15:24.916
THERE ARE SOME.

02:15:24.983 --> 02:15:26.451
VERY EXCELLENT DISCUSSIONS GOING

02:15:26.518 --> 02:15:27.853
ON RIGHT NOW IN THIS PRESCRIBED

02:15:27.919 --> 02:15:29.688
BURN COMMUNITY AS WE TALK ABOUT

02:15:29.754 --> 02:15:30.922
THE POTENTIAL FOR LIABILITY

02:15:30.989 --> 02:15:32.691
INSURANCE WE TALK ABOUT POOLED

02:15:32.757 --> 02:15:33.525
INSURANCE THAT.

02:15:33.592 --> 02:15:34.893
THE PRESCRIBER COMMUNITY ACROSS

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:38.497
THE LEVERAGING IDEAS WHICH

02:15:38.563 --> 02:15:41.066
SHARED POOL OF OF INSURANCE AND

02:15:41.132 --> 02:15:42.334
VERY PROMISING POTENTIAL

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:43.902
APPROACH BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE

02:15:43.969 --> 02:15:45.003

02:16:40.058 --> 02:16:41.293
UP THEIR PART OF THE WATERSHED

02:16:41.359 --> 02:16:42.727
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM THAT JIM

02:16:42.794 --> 02:16:44.062
TALKED ABOUT --

02:16:44.129 --> 02:16:46.164
THERE A CRITICAL PARTNER IN

02:16:46.231 --> 02:16:48.833
WATERSHED PROJECTS BECAUSE IT IN

02:16:56.174 --> 02:16:56.942
GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY WHICH

THE FOR SERVICES BEEN VERY OPEN

02:16:59.144 --> 02:16:59.578
AND WORKING WITH US IN

02:16:59.644 --> 02:17:00.879
DEVELOPING.

02:17:00.946 --> 02:17:01.780
UP THESE ARE ALL TO OF MEMBERS

WORKING ACROSS FORCE BOUNDARIES --

02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:07.986
YES SOMETIMES WE MAY BE AT ODDS

02:17:08.053 --> 02:17:09.287
BETWEEN THE STATE'S ROLE IN

LET THAT BE THE IMPEDIMENT AT

02:17:19.664 --> 02:17:21.366
THE BOUNDARY. TO GET THIS WORK

02:17:21.433 --> 02:17:22.767
DONE AND I THINK ALL THE EFFORTS

02:17:22.834 --> 02:17:24.235
THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT TODAY ARE

02:17:24.302 --> 02:17:25.937
REALLY LEADING THE WAY IN

02:17:26.004 --> 02:17:27.505
BREAKING ALL THOSE BARRIERS DOWN

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:29.307
TO GETTING THE WORK DONE.

02:17:29.374 --> 02:17:30.141

THE STATE IS --

02:17:33.411 --> 02:17:35.213
EXEMPLARY AT THE PRESENT TIME OR

02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:35.981
DO YOU THINK THAT THEIR

02:17:36.047 --> 02:17:37.182
RELATIONSHIP SOMETHING NEEDS

02:17:37.248 --> 02:17:39.651
SOME MORE HELP.

02:17:39.718 --> 02:17:41.820
WITH RESPECT TO FIRE MITIGATION

02:17:41.886 --> 02:17:43.655
CLEARING GETTING RID OF A

02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:44.289
HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD

02:17:44.356 --> 02:17:45.657
OR DYING TREES.

02:17:45.724 --> 02:17:46.524
ARE WE GETTING THE KIND OF

02:17:46.591 --> 02:17:48.093
COOPERATION AND THIS EMERGENCY

02:17:48.159 --> 02:17:49.527
SITUATION TO REDUCE THE SENATE

02:17:49.594 --> 02:17:51.363
CHIEF AND I SPENT YESTERDAY WITH

02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:53.565
THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR THIS

02:17:53.632 --> 02:17:54.399
WELL LISTA.

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:56.167
AS MUCH ON REGIONAL FOR ST.

02:17:56.234 --> 02:17:58.803
AND WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE ON A

02:17:58.870 --> 02:18:00.105
LOT OF THIS BUT I WOULD REFER

02:18:00.171 --> 02:18:01.172
YOU BACK TO MY EARLIER COMMENTS

02:18:01.239 --> 02:18:02.607
THAT.

02:18:02.674 --> 02:18:03.575
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR

02:18:03.642 --> 02:18:05.944
BUDGET FIX GO IN FOR A YEAR AND

02:18:06.011 --> 02:18:07.679
SO IF THEY HAVE TO SPEND AN

02:18:07.746 --> 02:18:09.514
EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON

02:18:09.581 --> 02:18:11.249
FIRE FIGHTING DEATH MUCH LESS

02:18:11.316 --> 02:18:12.617
MONEY FOR RESTORATION OF

02:18:12.951 --> 02:18:15.954
AND I HAVE AND THAT IS NOT A

02:18:16.021 --> 02:18:17.288
FUNCTION OF HOW GOOD WERE

02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:19.090
GETTING ALONG IT'S A FUNCTION OF

02:18:19.157 --> 02:18:21.059
THEIR STRUCTURE SO WE'RE REALLY

02:18:21.126 --> 02:18:21.926
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.

02:18:21.993 --> 02:18:23.662
FIXED BECAUSE I THINK THAT SPEAK

02:18:23.728 --> 02:18:25.897
TO YOUR QUESTION FIGURE TWO MORE

02:18:25.964 --> 02:18:27.165
QUESTIONS AND NOT BE DONE.

02:18:27.232 --> 02:18:30.402
I WANT TO GET BACK --

02:18:30.468 --> 02:18:34.139
TO THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION --

02:18:34.205 --> 02:18:35.507
IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THE

02:18:35.573 --> 02:18:36.908
THE PRESIDENT SAY THAT THEY LIKE

02:18:36.975 --> 02:18:37.609
TO TAKE THINGS SLOW.

02:18:37.676 --> 02:18:40.412
THAT THE PC --

02:18:40.478 --> 02:18:40.979
I THINK MANY OF US ON THE

02:18:41.046 --> 02:18:42.881
COMMITTEE WERE A BIT ALARMED BY

02:18:42.947 --> 02:18:43.448
THAT COMMENT THAT ONE OF THE

02:18:43.515 --> 02:18:44.549
THINGS HAPPEN.

02:18:44.616 --> 02:18:46.618
QUITE A BIT FASTER BUT HE

02:18:46.685 --> 02:18:48.153
MENTIONED THAT HE BASICALLY HAVE

02:18:48.219 --> 02:18:49.821
THREE DEEP THIRTY BEING COUNTERS

02:18:49.888 --> 02:18:51.156
OF THE ONES THAT ARE OVERSEEING

02:18:51.222 --> 02:18:52.724
ALL THE ELECTRICAL LINES OF

02:18:52.791 --> 02:18:54.292
THOUSANDS OF LINES THROUGHOUT

02:18:54.359 --> 02:18:56.194
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:18:56.261 --> 02:18:57.529
AND WE SAW NUMBER FIRES WERE

02:18:57.595 --> 02:18:59.698
STARTED.

02:18:59.764 --> 02:19:00.765
THE FAULT OF SOME UTILITIES AND

02:19:00.832 --> 02:19:01.800
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH

02:19:01.866 --> 02:19:03.568
IS A CONCERN FOR SOME OF US MANY

02:19:03.635 --> 02:19:06.671
OF US --

02:19:06.738 --> 02:19:08.273
WHERE DO YOU SEE MR PRIME LA

02:19:08.339 --> 02:19:10.775
DACHAU FIRE IT IN THIS NEW

02:19:10.842 --> 02:19:12.210
NORMAL IS RECALLING AND NOW DO

02:19:12.277 --> 02:19:13.611
YOU SEE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:19:13.678 --> 02:19:17.282
MORE OF A FIRE OVERSIGHT?

02:19:17.348 --> 02:19:18.817
IN THE INSPECTION PROCESS

02:19:18.883 --> 02:19:20.518
PARTNERING WITH THE P. YOU SEE

02:19:20.585 --> 02:19:22.287
TO ALLEVIATE [inaudible]

02:19:22.353 --> 02:19:24.856
THE SHORT.

02:19:24.923 --> 02:19:26.024
AMOUNT OF MANPOWER A FEW WILL

02:19:26.091 --> 02:19:28.293
THAT THEY HAVE TO ENSURE THAT.

02:19:28.359 --> 02:19:29.928
WE GET THE PROPER VEGETATION

02:19:29.994 --> 02:19:31.096
MANAGEMENT IN AROUND DANGEROUS

02:19:31.162 --> 02:19:32.964
POWERLINES.

02:19:33.031 --> 02:19:34.032
I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:19:34.099 --> 02:19:35.533
PROPOSAL THAT HE PRESENTED TO

02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:36.935
YOU IN HIS LETTER IN JULY REALLY

02:19:37.001 --> 02:19:38.703
LAYS OUT THE KINDS OF THINGS WE

02:19:38.770 --> 02:19:40.305
THINK NEED TO BE DONE.

02:19:40.371 --> 02:19:41.506
BY WORKING WITH THE UTILITIES

02:19:41.573 --> 02:19:43.108
COMMISSION AND AND THE UTILITIES

02:19:43.174 --> 02:19:44.943
THEMSELVES TO CONTINUE.

02:19:45.009 --> 02:19:46.611
TO IMPROVE AND WERE AT THE THAT

02:19:46.678 --> 02:19:48.713
THE FILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS

02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:51.182
AND REDUCE THAT RISK.

02:19:51.249 --> 02:19:52.817
I'VE OH MORE OVERSIGHT CAL FIRE

02:19:52.884 --> 02:19:54.486
AGAIN THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE THE

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:56.688
ABILITY TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE

02:19:56.755 --> 02:19:58.156
YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS

02:19:58.223 --> 02:19:59.257
MORE PEOPLE.

02:19:59.324 --> 02:20:00.892
RIGHT CLEARLY AGAIN AS I TALKED

02:20:00.959 --> 02:20:03.027
ABOUT EARLIER THE DELINEATION OF

02:20:03.094 --> 02:20:04.129
RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE

02:20:04.195 --> 02:20:05.730
REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

02:20:06.765 --> 02:20:08.700
AND CAL FIRES RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:20:08.767 --> 02:20:10.368
ENFORCE THE FORCE AND FIRE LAWS

02:20:10.435 --> 02:20:12.504
YES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME

02:20:12.570 --> 02:20:13.138
POWER LINE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE

02:20:13.204 --> 02:20:16.307
BUT TWO DIFFERENT PROCESSES. ONE

02:20:16.374 --> 02:20:18.977
IN STATUTE IN BEEN ONE IN IN THE

02:20:19.043 --> 02:20:20.678
REGULATORY PROCESS OUT WE NEED

02:20:20.745 --> 02:20:22.914

OUR AMMO YOU WITH THE COMMISSION

02:20:25.450 --> 02:20:25.917

02:20:25.984 --> 02:20:27.118
EXPERTISE.

02:20:27.185 --> 02:20:30.288
AND SUPPORT BUT CERTAINLY AS THE

02:20:30.355 --> 02:20:32.157
FORWARD TO DISCUSS.

02:20:32.223 --> 02:20:33.825
IMPROVING THESE MITIGATION PLANS

02:20:33.892 --> 02:20:35.727
TO ENHANCE OF THE ABILITY TO GET

02:20:35.794 --> 02:20:37.362
MORE -- A

02:20:37.428 --> 02:20:39.964
THIRD PARTY OVERSIGHT AS WELL AS

02:20:40.031 --> 02:20:42.801
ADDITIONAL --

02:20:42.867 --> 02:20:43.434
ELEMENTS WITHIN THOSE PLANS TO

02:20:43.501 --> 02:20:44.102
REDUCE RISK [inaudible]

02:20:44.169 --> 02:20:46.171
APPRECIATE THAT --

02:20:46.237 --> 02:20:47.438
AND THEN LASTLY --

SUCH THAT WE CAN NOT EXPEDITE --

02:20:54.813 --> 02:20:56.181
REVIEWS OF AREAS WE NEED TO BE

02:20:56.247 --> 02:20:59.684
CLEARED BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S A

02:20:59.751 --> 02:21:00.351
LEASE ALARMING FOR ME THAT IT'S

02:21:00.418 --> 02:21:04.255
GOING TO BE YEARS BEFORE WE HAVE

02:21:04.322 --> 02:21:06.224
THAT PROGRAMMATIC <u>&lt;c.green&gt; I ARE IN&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:21:06.291 --> 02:21:06.858
SUCH PLACES YEAH MANY GOING TO

DEAL WITH THE LITIGATION THAT'S

02:21:07.892 --> 02:21:08.760
GOING TO HAPPEN AFTERWARDS --

02:21:08.827 --> 02:21:09.928
WHEN I GO OUT AND TOWN HALLS

FIRE ACTIVITY AND SO IT'S A IT

02:27:18.963 --> 02:27:21.599
IT.

02:27:21.666 --> 02:27:23.234
THE IT IS IMPACTING FIRE SEASON

02:27:23.301 --> 02:27:24.702
IS IMPACTING ALL OF THIS IT'S

02:27:24.769 --> 02:27:26.170
IMPACTING CAPACITY AND IT'S

02:27:26.237 --> 02:27:27.705
IMPACTING THE WINDOWS.

02:27:27.772 --> 02:27:28.339
WHICH WE CAN SAFELY GET THE WORK

02:27:28.406 --> 02:27:29.674
DONE.

02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:31.342
SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT

02:27:31.409 --> 02:27:33.611
EIGHT EIGHT DEDICATED PREVENTION.

02:27:33.678 --> 02:27:35.179
COMPONENT THAT WORKS ON THESE

02:27:35.246 --> 02:27:36.881
THINGS YEAR ROUND AND AND YOU'RE

02:27:36.948 --> 02:27:37.782
AND YOU'RE FINE AS SEPARATE

02:27:37.848 --> 02:27:38.816
DEPARTMENT THAT THIS FIRE

02:27:38.883 --> 02:27:40.418
PREVENTION THE SIX FIRE A

02:27:40.484 --> 02:27:42.019
PRESCRIBED FIRE FUELS CRUZ IS

02:27:42.086 --> 02:27:43.487
EXACTLY WHAT THAT'S GEARED

02:27:43.554 --> 02:27:44.355
TOWARDS ITS THESE.

02:27:44.422 --> 02:27:45.523
THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE

02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:47.325
FOCUSED ON THIS TWELVE MONTHS

02:27:47.391 --> 02:27:48.125
OUT OF THE YEAR.

02:27:48.192 --> 02:27:49.660
I TAKE ADVANTAGE OR THINGS THEY

02:27:49.727 --> 02:27:50.828
CAN EVEN DO DURING THE SUMMER

02:27:50.895 --> 02:27:51.829
MONTHS THAT --

02:27:51.896 --> 02:27:54.332
ARE LOW RISK THAT CAN KEEP WORK

02:27:54.398 --> 02:27:58.703
GOING ON ALL YEAR.

02:27:58.769 --> 02:28:00.871
THANK YOU SHARON SO.

02:28:00.938 --> 02:28:03.774
AND VEGETATION TO THIS FOR CAN.

02:28:03.841 --> 02:28:05.476
CHIEF HAD LOTS USE ME.

02:28:05.543 --> 02:28:07.545
A SO YOU YOU MANAGE ALL KINDS OF

02:28:07.612 --> 02:28:08.613
DIFFERENT EDUCATION I THINK THE

02:28:08.679 --> 02:28:09.880
SENATOR BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT

02:28:09.947 --> 02:28:10.881
THAT YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT

02:28:10.948 --> 02:28:12.550
FORESTRY WE TALK ABOUT.

02:28:12.617 --> 02:28:13.618
BUT THERE IS THERE'S OAK

02:28:13.684 --> 02:28:14.919
WOODLANDS THERE'S A CHAPARRAL

02:28:14.986 --> 02:28:15.886
THERE'S FORCES WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:28:15.953 --> 02:28:17.788
DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEGETATION IN

02:28:17.855 --> 02:28:18.723
CALIFORNIA.

02:28:18.789 --> 02:28:20.224
IT'S ALL LIVE.

02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:22.393
IT'S ALL GROWING.

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:24.695
PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND AND MOISTURE

02:28:24.762 --> 02:28:25.596
AND ALL THOSE THINGS MAKE IT

02:28:25.663 --> 02:28:26.664
GROW.

02:28:26.731 --> 02:28:27.498
AND THERE'S BEEN A BIG HUGE

02:28:27.565 --> 02:28:29.267
DEBATE NATIONALLY FOR ABOUT THE

02:28:29.333 --> 02:28:30.901
LAST THIRTY YEARS AND HERE IN

02:28:30.968 --> 02:28:32.670
THE STATE ABOUT WE SHOULD JUST

02:28:32.737 --> 02:28:34.338
WALK AWAY FROM IT AND LET IT DO

02:28:34.405 --> 02:28:36.707
ITS NATURAL THING.

02:28:36.774 --> 02:28:39.577
AND THERE'S BEEN MANY LAWSUITS.

02:28:39.644 --> 02:28:42.446
MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS --

02:28:42.513 --> 02:28:43.681
AT EACH OTHER'S THROAT OVER HOW

02:28:43.748 --> 02:28:46.284
WE SHOULD MANAGE BUT WE KINDA AT

02:28:46.350 --> 02:28:47.318
LEAST IN MY MIND.

02:28:47.385 --> 02:28:48.819
THE CONCLUSION IS IF WE JUST DO

02:28:48.886 --> 02:28:50.154
NOTHING AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW

02:28:50.221 --> 02:28:51.489
WE DO NOT THINK.

02:28:51.555 --> 02:28:52.790
AND WE JUST LET IT GO BACK TO

02:28:52.857 --> 02:28:54.759
ITS NATURAL STATE.

02:28:54.825 --> 02:28:58.129
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF OF NGUYEN

02:28:58.195 --> 02:29:00.264
BUT OR WILL LET'S WIN IT WILL

02:29:00.331 --> 02:29:01.866
BURN IT WILL EVENTUALLY BURN

02:29:01.932 --> 02:29:03.567
CORRECT CORRECT.

02:29:03.634 --> 02:29:04.468
SO.

02:29:04.535 --> 02:29:05.636
WHAT WE TALK ABOUT THE PROCESSES

02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:06.871
THAT?

02:29:06.937 --> 02:29:09.440
WE MOVE THROUGH.

02:29:09.507 --> 02:29:10.775
AND AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN

02:29:10.841 --> 02:29:11.075
[inaudible]

02:29:11.142 --> 02:29:12.076
HIGHLY FRUSTRATED [inaudible]

02:29:12.143 --> 02:29:16.981
AT I'VE READ TWELVE BILLS IN THE

02:29:17.048 --> 02:29:17.481
SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE

02:29:17.548 --> 02:29:19.617
ADDRESSING.

02:29:19.684 --> 02:29:21.485
ALL THAT MOVING PIECES THAT YOU

02:29:21.552 --> 02:29:22.987
HAVE TO GET THROUGH TO GET TO

02:29:23.054 --> 02:29:24.021
SOMEPLACE TO DO.

02:29:24.088 --> 02:29:26.223
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.

02:29:26.290 --> 02:29:29.794
AS WITH A HEAVY HEART.

02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:31.295
WE TALKED BICU WE LOST ANOTHER

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:32.730
ONE TODAY HOW WE'RE GONNA LOSE

02:29:32.797 --> 02:29:34.365
LIVES RELEASE PROPERTY.

02:29:34.432 --> 02:29:36.734
BUT WE WILL WORRY ABOUT A BUG

02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:37.034
[inaudible]

02:29:37.101 --> 02:29:40.304
OR A RED LEGGED FROG.

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:43.474
OR ARE YOU NAME IT.

02:29:43.541 --> 02:29:44.542
AND ANY TIES AND IF YOU GO OUT

02:29:44.608 --> 02:29:45.976
LOOK ON THE GROUND I HAVE PHOTOS

02:29:46.043 --> 02:29:47.345
OF THEM.

02:29:47.411 --> 02:29:49.180
DESTROYED THE HABITAT GONE

02:29:49.246 --> 02:29:50.915
THEY'RE DEAD.

02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:51.916
WERE BREATHING CARBON WE'RE

02:29:51.982 --> 02:29:54.685
TRYING TO SEQUESTER.

02:29:54.752 --> 02:29:56.554
AT THE PACE AND SCALE THAT WE

02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.422
NEED TO MOVE TO GET OUR FOR

02:29:58.489 --> 02:30:00.891
VEGETATION WHETHER IT'S IN.

02:30:00.958 --> 02:30:02.793
GREAT SENATORS DISTRICT OR ITS

02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:05.196
AND THE VALLEY OR FITS IN.

02:30:05.262 --> 02:30:07.932
THE FOOT HILLS AND FOREST.

02:30:07.998 --> 02:30:09.367
WHAT IS THE SOLUTION WHAT IS THE

02:30:09.433 --> 02:30:10.534
SOLUTION TO GETTING US TO A

02:30:10.601 --> 02:30:11.769
PROGRAM?

02:30:11.836 --> 02:30:13.070
TYPE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT

02:30:13.137 --> 02:30:14.372
FIVE YEARS.

02:30:14.438 --> 02:30:16.374
THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM.

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:18.342
DELIVER SOMETHING AS LEGISLATORS

02:30:18.409 --> 02:30:20.144
TO OUR CONSTITUENTS.

02:30:20.211 --> 02:30:21.379
THAT TAKES CARE OF THE FUEL

02:30:21.445 --> 02:30:23.781
LOADING PROBLEMS OUT THERE.

02:30:23.848 --> 02:30:25.216
WELL THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS THAT

02:30:25.282 --> 02:30:26.884
THE IT'S NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

02:30:26.951 --> 02:30:29.019
PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE SPECIES

02:30:29.086 --> 02:30:31.122
AND HABITAT AND INCREASING OUR

02:30:31.188 --> 02:30:32.423
PACE AND SCALE OF FUELS

02:30:32.490 --> 02:30:34.058
TREATMENT AND FORCE MANAGEMENT.

02:30:34.125 --> 02:30:36.127
BUT IT CAN IT CAN ALL BE DONE --

02:30:36.193 --> 02:30:37.194
IT'S A MATTER OF BRINGING

02:30:37.261 --> 02:30:39.163
EVERYBODY TOGETHER PROJECTS THAT

02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:40.865
JIM BRANHAM TALKED ABOUT HERE IN

02:30:40.931 --> 02:30:42.199
THE CENTRAL SIERRA TAHOE

02:30:42.266 --> 02:30:43.534
INITIATIVE THEY'RE ALL AT THE

02:30:43.601 --> 02:30:45.569
TABLE AND WE'RE TALKING.

02:30:45.636 --> 02:30:47.204
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES

02:30:47.271 --> 02:30:48.706
READY AND PARTNERS WE

02:30:48.773 --> 02:30:50.574
SIGNIFICANT FUNDING JUST THIS

02:30:50.641 --> 02:30:52.176
YEAR FROM JUST THE STATE WITH

02:30:52.243 --> 02:30:53.644
MATCHED FUNDING FROM OTHER

02:30:53.711 --> 02:30:55.045
PARTNERS THOSE OF THE PROJECTS

02:30:55.112 --> 02:30:56.914
WE NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

02:30:56.981 --> 02:30:57.481
WE'VE GOT THE STAKEHOLDERS A

02:30:57.548 --> 02:30:58.382
TABLE.

02:30:58.449 --> 02:30:59.950
WE JUST WE NEED TO GET.

02:31:00.017 --> 02:31:01.652
THE CHAINSAWS WE GET FOLKS ON

02:31:01.719 --> 02:31:03.053
THE GROUND AND START TO WORK AND

02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:04.622
IN MANY CASES ENVIRONMENTAL.

02:31:04.688 --> 02:31:06.056
REVIEW WAS READY TO GO WE NEED

02:31:06.123 --> 02:31:08.325
TO FIND THOSE PROJECTS.

02:31:08.392 --> 02:31:10.094
HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND AND AND

02:31:10.161 --> 02:31:11.562
START THE WORK RIGHT NOW AND

02:31:11.629 --> 02:31:12.630
BUILD THAT MOMENTUM SO WE CAN

02:31:12.696 --> 02:31:14.865
TRULY GET TO THESE GOALS.

02:31:14.932 --> 02:31:15.933
EVERY SINGLE BILL THAT I

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.402
PROPOSED WAS.

02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:20.371
OPPOSED BY NOW NAY IN THE

02:31:20.438 --> 02:31:21.906
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS BECAUSE IT

02:31:21.972 --> 02:31:23.874
JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME IF

02:31:23.941 --> 02:31:25.009
YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BURN WE

02:31:25.075 --> 02:31:26.610
TALK ABOUT.

02:31:26.677 --> 02:31:28.245
IN THE FORCED THE SIZE OF A TREE

02:31:28.312 --> 02:31:30.548
YOU CAN HARVEST.

02:31:30.614 --> 02:31:31.816
AND SOME OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLY

02:31:31.882 --> 02:31:33.617
HAVE SOME VALUE IN THEM.

02:31:33.684 --> 02:31:34.618
IF YOU HAVE A FORCED OF OLD

02:31:34.685 --> 02:31:37.321
GROWTH TREES.

02:31:37.388 --> 02:31:38.722
NICE TO SAY THEY'RE ALL FIFTY

02:31:38.789 --> 02:31:39.890
INCHES IN DIAMETER AND THE

02:31:39.957 --> 02:31:42.626
CANOPIES.

02:31:42.693 --> 02:31:43.527
THEY'RE SO CLOSE TO EACH OF THAT

02:31:43.594 --> 02:31:45.029
THERE'D THERE'D.

02:31:45.095 --> 02:31:46.697
DO YOU THEY WILL CROWN OUT AND

02:31:46.764 --> 02:31:48.732
BURN. TO THE GROUND.

02:31:48.799 --> 02:31:50.167
AND THEIR OLD GROWTH TREES OR

02:31:50.234 --> 02:31:51.969
WHAT WE CAN SEVERAL GROWTH IF

02:31:52.036 --> 02:31:53.838
YOU REMOVE SOME OF THOSE.

02:31:53.904 --> 02:31:54.805
AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPEN

02:31:54.872 --> 02:31:55.773
CANOPY WHERE THE FIRE COMES THAT

02:31:55.840 --> 02:31:57.842
FLOOR.

02:31:57.908 --> 02:31:59.510
AND WE HAVE PHOTOS IN ALL KINDS

02:31:59.577 --> 02:32:00.678
OF INFORMATION THE SHOWS THAT

02:32:00.744 --> 02:32:01.645
WHEN THAT WHEN YOU DO ACTUALLY

02:32:01.712 --> 02:32:03.247
OF THIN THAT OUT.

02:32:03.314 --> 02:32:04.615
THAT THOSE TREES ARE STILL ALIVE

02:32:04.682 --> 02:32:06.417
WHEN YOU DON'T SEQUESTER CARBON.

02:32:06.484 --> 02:32:07.918
HOW CAN WE GET THROUGH A PROCESS

02:32:07.985 --> 02:32:08.986
WHEN WE ACTUALLY START TALKING

02:32:09.053 --> 02:32:09.653
ABOUT?

02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:11.188
THE CANOPY ON THE GROUND OR THE

02:32:11.255 --> 02:32:12.556
VEGETATION ON THE GROUND THAT'S

02:32:12.623 --> 02:32:14.158
MANAGEABLE FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO

02:32:14.225 --> 02:32:15.726
GET INTO SAFELY RESTORE

02:32:15.793 --> 02:32:17.561
WATERSHEDS AND GET TO OF A

02:32:17.628 --> 02:32:19.497
PERMITTING PROCESS WE DON'T GET.

02:32:19.563 --> 02:32:23.567
SUIT AND LOBBIED AND SCORE CARDS

02:32:23.634 --> 02:32:25.069
AND ALL THOSE THINGS OUT THERE

02:32:25.135 --> 02:32:25.703
THAT ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING GOOD

02:32:25.769 --> 02:32:27.238
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

02:32:27.304 --> 02:32:28.372
EXPERTS SCIENTISTS INCLUDING

02:32:28.439 --> 02:32:30.374
DOCTOR DOCTOR STEVENS THAT DR

02:32:30.441 --> 02:32:32.109
MALCOLM NORTH DOCTOR JOHN

02:32:32.176 --> 02:32:34.311
BATTLES ALL AGREE. FOR THEY HAVE

02:32:34.378 --> 02:32:35.646
THE DOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE THE

02:32:35.713 --> 02:32:37.281
SCIENCE TO INDICATE WHAT THE

02:32:37.348 --> 02:32:38.983
RIGHTS TO THAT FUNDING LEVELS

02:32:39.049 --> 02:32:40.251
ARE WHAT THE NUMBER OF TREES PER

02:32:40.317 --> 02:32:42.620
ACRE BASED ON THE LOCATION.

02:32:42.686 --> 02:32:43.821
THE SCIENCES ALL THERE NOW WE

02:32:43.888 --> 02:32:44.655
JUST HAVE TO GO OUT ON THE

02:32:44.722 --> 02:32:47.958
GROUND TO PUT IT TO WORK.

02:32:48.025 --> 02:32:49.126
AND IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE

02:32:49.193 --> 02:32:50.461
THING MISTER ALI --

02:32:50.528 --> 02:32:51.862
AS WE'VE BEGUN BRING FOLKS

02:32:51.929 --> 02:32:53.898
TOGETHER INCIDENT IN AND TRY TO

02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:54.565
WORK THROUGH WHAT THE SCIENCE IS

02:32:54.632 --> 02:32:56.066
TELLING US WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN

02:32:56.133 --> 02:32:57.201
THIS YEAR AT LEAST WE HAVE A LOT

02:32:57.268 --> 02:32:58.269
OF ENVIRONMENT GROUPS THAT ARE

02:32:58.335 --> 02:32:59.703
ACTIVELY INVOLVED.

02:32:59.770 --> 02:33:00.804
IN HELPING US FIGURE IT OUT AND

02:33:00.871 --> 02:33:02.273
THEY'RE NOT PURSUING LITIGATION

02:33:02.339 --> 02:33:04.308
AS THEIR STRATEGY NOT EVERYONE'S

02:33:04.375 --> 02:33:05.609
A BOARD OF THAT PROBABLY NEVER

02:33:05.676 --> 02:33:07.311
WILL BE BUT I THINK THAT THE

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:08.245
CHIEF'S POINT.

02:33:08.312 --> 02:33:09.747
USE THE SCIENCE ME BY GUIDED BY

02:33:09.813 --> 02:33:11.081
THE SCIENCE AND IT'S TELLING US

02:33:11.148 --> 02:33:12.149
THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

02:33:12.216 --> 02:33:13.884
VERY DIFFERENT THERE'S A LOT OF

02:33:13.951 --> 02:33:16.353
OF REALLY GOOD INVOLVEMENT FROM.

02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:16.921
THE ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE ON

02:33:16.987 --> 02:33:17.655
THAT AND I THINK.

02:33:17.721 --> 02:33:19.390
IF IT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE TO

02:33:19.456 --> 02:33:19.924
SIT DOWN AND FIGURE IT OUT

02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:21.892
TOGETHER.

02:33:21.959 --> 02:33:23.260
NOT BEING SATISFIED WITH

02:33:23.327 --> 02:33:24.328
OUTCOMES THAT YOU DESCRIBED WHAT

02:33:24.395 --> 02:33:26.897
HAPPENED.

02:33:26.964 --> 02:33:27.998
MAYBE WE'LL HAVE A NEW NORMAL IN

02:33:28.065 --> 02:33:30.167
THE LEGISLATURE LUCY.

02:33:30.234 --> 02:33:32.570
I WANT TO THANK ALL THREE OF YOU

02:33:32.636 --> 02:33:33.938

02:33:35.706 --> 02:33:35.906
HE HAD --

02:33:35.973 --> 02:33:39.143
CHIEF UP I THINK.

02:33:39.209 --> 02:33:40.611
NOT ON THIS IS MORE THE

02:33:40.678 --> 02:33:41.979
PREVENTION THE CLEARING SIDE NOT

02:33:42.046 --> 02:33:43.581
THE SUPPRESSION SIDE.

02:33:43.647 --> 02:33:45.316
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

02:33:45.382 --> 02:33:46.784
CALL YOU OUT AT ALL OF THE WOMEN

02:33:46.850 --> 02:33:48.419
IN MEN.

02:33:48.485 --> 02:33:50.254
IN YOUR OPERATION AND ALL THE

02:33:50.321 --> 02:33:52.890
MUTUAL AID --

02:33:52.957 --> 02:33:54.692
BECOMES TO HELP --

02:33:54.758 --> 02:33:56.026
CAO FIRE ON ALL THESE FIRES

02:33:56.093 --> 02:33:57.628
THROUGHOUT THE STATES WANT TO

02:33:57.695 --> 02:34:01.999
THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible]

02:34:02.066 --> 02:34:09.573
CO CHAIR.

02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:11.008
I WILL NOW CALL FORWARD THE

02:34:11.075 --> 02:34:12.343
FINAL PANEL OF THE DAY THIS

02:34:12.409 --> 02:34:13.444
WOULD BE DEALING WITH WOOD

02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:15.245
PRODUCTS MARKETS.

02:34:15.312 --> 02:34:18.315
AND BIOMASS POLICY --

02:34:18.382 --> 02:34:19.850
WILL CALL FOR RICH GORDON

02:34:19.917 --> 02:34:21.652
PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA FORESTRY

02:34:21.719 --> 02:34:24.688
ASSOCIATION [inaudible]

02:34:24.755 --> 02:34:26.490
JONATHAN KOZOL.

02:34:26.557 --> 02:34:27.625
EXECUTIVE RECTOR SIERRA

INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNITY AND

02:34:29.026 --> 02:34:31.395
ENVIRONMENT.

02:34:31.462 --> 02:34:33.731
EDWARD RANDOLPH DIRECTOR CPUC

02:34:33.797 --> 02:34:36.000
ENERGY DIVISION.

02:34:36.066 --> 02:34:37.067
AND CATHERINE PHILLIPS SIERRA

02:34:37.134 --> 02:34:52.750
CLUB.

02:34:52.816 --> 02:34:55.519
CATHERINE IS NOT HERE SO.

02:34:55.586 --> 02:34:59.690
TELL ME YOUR NAME.

02:34:59.757 --> 02:35:02.026
I HAD WOULD MORENO UP THIS YEAR

02:35:02.092 --> 02:35:04.294
COULD CALIFORNIA NINE ALONG WITH --

02:35:04.361 --> 02:35:05.629
DE NUMBER.

02:35:05.696 --> 02:35:06.463
VERY GOOD.

02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:07.798
COULD I JUST POINT OUT THAT ALL

02:35:07.865 --> 02:35:09.266
THE PANELS WE HAVEN'T HAD A

02:35:09.333 --> 02:35:12.302
SINGLE WOMAN [inaudible]

02:35:12.369 --> 02:35:18.742
JUST.

02:35:18.809 --> 02:35:20.110
TODAY WE HAVEN'T HAD IF I'VE

02:35:20.177 --> 02:35:23.247
MISSED SOMETHING.

02:35:23.313 --> 02:35:25.716
HE WAS INVITED BUT THE OPTICS

02:35:25.783 --> 02:35:27.985
HERE ARE SOMEWHAT STUNNING AND I

02:35:28.052 --> 02:35:34.091
JUST WANTED TO POINT THEM OUT.

02:35:34.158 --> 02:35:37.127
OKAY RICH TO UNFOLD AND MAKE YOU.

02:35:37.194 --> 02:35:37.628
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

02:35:37.695 --> 02:35:39.963
OF THERE ARE MANY FACTORS

02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:41.231
RELATED TO THE CATASTROPHIC

02:35:41.298 --> 02:35:41.999
FIRES THAT CALIFORNIA'S

02:35:42.066 --> 02:35:43.167
EXPERIENCING [inaudible]

02:35:43.233 --> 02:35:45.135
HISTORIC DROUGHT.

02:35:45.202 --> 02:35:45.969
HOTTER TEMPERATURES LOWER

02:35:46.036 --> 02:35:47.838
HUMIDITY.

02:35:47.905 --> 02:35:49.907
LAND USE DECISIONS.

02:35:49.973 --> 02:35:51.175
AND INCREASING URBAN WILDLIFE

02:35:51.241 --> 02:35:52.676
INTERFACE.

02:35:52.743 --> 02:35:53.644
A LACK OF INVESTMENT IN

02:35:53.711 --> 02:35:55.546
PREVENTION.

02:35:55.612 --> 02:35:57.715
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:35:57.781 --> 02:35:59.750
FACTOR IS SIMPLY THIS.

02:35:59.817 --> 02:36:02.152
THERE IS TOO MUCH FUEL.

02:36:02.219 --> 02:36:03.253
CALIFORNIA HAS A VEGETATION

02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:07.658
MANAGEMENT PROBLEM.

02:36:07.725 --> 02:36:08.258
OUR GRASSLANDS ARE OVERGROWN.

02:36:08.325 --> 02:36:09.727
WE HAVE TOO MUCH CHAPARRAL.

02:36:09.793 --> 02:36:12.296
AND OUR FORESTS ARE OVERLY DENSE.

02:36:12.362 --> 02:36:13.397
IF WE DO NOTHING ELSE TO PREVENT

02:36:13.464 --> 02:36:15.365
FIRES.

02:36:15.432 --> 02:36:17.801
WE MUST REDUCE THE FUEL LOAD.

02:36:17.868 --> 02:36:19.069
THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO ASSURE

02:36:19.136 --> 02:36:19.903
THAT HOMEOWNERS CREATE

02:36:19.970 --> 02:36:21.972
DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

02:36:22.039 --> 02:36:23.006
WE HAVE TO INCREASE GRAZING OF

02:36:23.073 --> 02:36:25.275
OUR GRASSLANDS.

02:36:25.342 --> 02:36:27.277
WE HAVE TO REDUCE CHAPARRAL.

02:36:27.344 --> 02:36:28.879
WE HAVE TO REMOVE DEAD TREES AND

02:36:28.946 --> 02:36:31.648
THIN OUR FORESTS.

02:36:31.715 --> 02:36:33.117
DEALING WITH OUR VEGETATION

02:36:33.183 --> 02:36:35.219
MANAGEMENT PROBLEM LEAVES US

02:36:35.285 --> 02:36:37.187
WITH THIS DILEMMA.

02:36:37.254 --> 02:36:40.891
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS MATERIAL?

02:36:40.958 --> 02:36:42.659
REMEMBER WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:36:42.726 --> 02:36:42.860
ABOUT.

02:36:42.926 --> 02:36:45.095
HIS WAIST.

02:36:45.162 --> 02:36:46.330
A HOMEOWNER WHO CREATES

02:36:46.396 --> 02:36:48.599
DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

02:36:48.665 --> 02:36:52.002
SEIZE THE CUT MATERIAL AS WASTE.

02:36:52.069 --> 02:36:53.670
CHAPARRAL REMOVED FROM A

02:36:53.737 --> 02:36:56.306
LANDSCAPE IS WASTE.

02:36:56.373 --> 02:36:58.509
WHEN THINNING THE FOREST?

02:36:58.575 --> 02:37:00.210
ANY TREE WITH VALUE TURNED INTO

02:37:00.277 --> 02:37:02.012
LUMBER.

02:37:02.079 --> 02:37:03.280
IT'S THE LIMBS [inaudible]

02:37:03.347 --> 02:37:04.381
THE BARK [inaudible]

02:37:04.448 --> 02:37:05.983
TOPS.

02:37:06.049 --> 02:37:07.951
THE VERY SMALL TREES AND

02:37:08.018 --> 02:37:10.120
ANYTHING THAT CANNOT BE TURNED

02:37:10.187 --> 02:37:10.954
INTO LUMBER [inaudible]

02:37:11.021 --> 02:37:13.924
THAT'S WASTE.

02:37:13.991 --> 02:37:17.427
WE CALL THIS WASTE BIOMASS.

02:37:17.494 --> 02:37:20.764
AND WHAT DO WE DO WITH BIOMASS.

02:37:20.831 --> 02:37:22.266
WHAT LANDFILLS CAN'T TAKE THIS

02:37:22.332 --> 02:37:24.902
MATERIAL?

02:37:24.968 --> 02:37:26.670
AND ONLY SO MUCH OF IT CAN BE

02:37:26.737 --> 02:37:28.105
TURNED INTO DECORATIVE CHIPS OR

02:37:28.172 --> 02:37:30.808
ANIMAL BEDDING.

02:37:30.874 --> 02:37:32.342
THE REST YOU COULD LEAVE TO ROT

02:37:32.409 --> 02:37:34.478
ON THE LAND.

02:37:34.545 --> 02:37:36.346
BUT IT IS STILL FUEL.

02:37:36.413 --> 02:37:37.381
AND WHILE RIDING IT RELEASES

02:37:37.447 --> 02:37:39.850
TOXIC POLLUTANTS.

02:37:39.917 --> 02:37:41.318
IF YOU HAVE A TIMBER AG

02:37:41.385 --> 02:37:42.686
OPERATION YOU CAN BURN IT OPEN

02:37:42.753 --> 02:37:44.721
PILE BURNING.

02:37:44.788 --> 02:37:45.856
BUT IT THAT ALSO RELEASES CARBON

02:37:45.923 --> 02:37:47.925
AND POLLUTANTS [inaudible]

02:37:47.991 --> 02:37:50.861
OR YOU CAN TAKE IT TO A BIOMASS

02:37:50.928 --> 02:37:52.095
FACILITIES WERE CAN BE TURNED

02:37:52.162 --> 02:37:54.131
INTO ENERGY.

02:37:54.198 --> 02:37:56.333
NOW YOU'LL HEAR THAT THIS IS NOT

02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:59.069
A CLEAN SOLUTION.

02:37:59.136 --> 02:38:00.704
BUT STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED

02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:01.605
THAT THE EMISSIONS FROM BIOMASS

02:38:01.672 --> 02:38:03.607
FACILITIES.

02:38:03.674 --> 02:38:05.342
ARE BETTER FOR AIR QUALITY.

02:38:05.409 --> 02:38:07.611
WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER OPTIONS?

02:38:07.678 --> 02:38:09.580
INCLUDING PILE BURNING.

02:38:09.646 --> 02:38:10.113
IT'S CERTAINLY BETTER THAN

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:11.481
WILDFIRE [inaudible]

02:38:11.548 --> 02:38:13.150
AND REMEMBER.

02:38:13.217 --> 02:38:14.151
THESE FACILITIES OPERATE WITH

02:38:14.218 --> 02:38:16.253
PERMITS YOU SHOULD BY LOCAL AIR

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.455
DISTRICTS.

02:38:18.522 --> 02:38:20.657
IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THAT LOCAL

02:38:20.724 --> 02:38:23.460
AIR QUALITY GOALS ARE ACHIEVED.

02:38:23.527 --> 02:38:25.128
AND YOU'RE TECHNOLOGIES MAKING

02:38:25.195 --> 02:38:26.163
THESE FACILITIES CLEANER ALL THE

02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:29.233
TIME.

02:38:29.299 --> 02:38:31.168
YOU'LL ALSO HEAR THAT BIOMASS IS

02:38:31.235 --> 02:38:33.770
EXPENSIVE ENERGY.

02:38:33.837 --> 02:38:35.038
WHEN COMPARED TWO OTHER

02:38:35.105 --> 02:38:37.007
RENEWABLE SOURCES THAT HAVE

02:38:37.074 --> 02:38:38.809
BENEFITTED FROM SUBSIDIES?

02:38:38.876 --> 02:38:40.177
BIOMASS IS NOT THE CHEAPEST

02:38:40.244 --> 02:38:42.813
RENEWABLE.

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:44.781
BUT I BELIEVE AT THIS MOMENT.

02:38:44.848 --> 02:38:46.717
ANY DISCUSSION OF COST.

02:38:46.783 --> 02:38:48.085
MUST INCLUDE THE ANALYSIS OF THE

02:38:48.151 --> 02:38:50.220
SOCIAL COST.

02:38:50.287 --> 02:38:52.222
IN LOS LIVES [inaudible]

02:38:52.289 --> 02:38:54.057
DESTROYED PROPERTY.

02:38:54.124 --> 02:38:55.325
AND DEVASTATED LANDSCAPES AND

02:38:55.392 --> 02:38:57.060
COMMUNITIES.

02:38:57.127 --> 02:38:59.696
THE SOCIAL COST OF NOT REMOVING

02:38:59.763 --> 02:39:02.032
EXCESS FUELS. FOR MORE WILD

02:39:02.099 --> 02:39:04.601
LANDS AND FORESTS.

02:39:04.668 --> 02:39:05.969
PERHAPS WE NEED TO FIND A WAY

02:39:06.036 --> 02:39:08.538
SOME WAY TO SUBSIDIZE BIOMASS IS

02:39:08.605 --> 02:39:09.773
PART OF OUR FIRE PREVENTION

02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:12.442
STRATEGY.

02:39:12.509 --> 02:39:14.044
THANKS TO PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE

02:39:14.111 --> 02:39:15.846
ACTION SEVEN BIOMASS PLANTS

02:39:15.913 --> 02:39:17.047
PRODUCING UNDER SEVENTY FIVE

02:39:17.114 --> 02:39:18.849
MEGAWATTS.

02:39:18.916 --> 02:39:20.717
CONTRACTS TO REDUCE POWER.

02:39:20.784 --> 02:39:22.252
AND ANOTHER SIXTEEN PLANTS

02:39:22.319 --> 02:39:24.888
ONLINE PRODUCING A TOTAL OF FIVE

02:39:24.955 --> 02:39:26.990
HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATTS OF POWER.

02:39:27.057 --> 02:39:28.492
SOME OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL

02:39:28.558 --> 02:39:30.961
EXPIRE IN THREE SHORT YEARS.

02:39:31.028 --> 02:39:32.729
THERE'S LOW HANGING FRUIT.

02:39:32.796 --> 02:39:34.298
THE LEGISLATURE COULD WORK TO

02:39:34.364 --> 02:39:35.732
GUARANTEE THE EXTENSION THE A

02:39:35.799 --> 02:39:36.733
CONTRACTS FOR ALL OF THESE

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:38.201
FACILITIES.

02:39:38.268 --> 02:39:39.369
SO THESE PLANTS REMAIN

02:39:39.436 --> 02:39:40.971
OPERATIONAL FOR A LONGER TERM OF

02:39:41.038 --> 02:39:43.273
TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS.

02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:44.207
THE COST OF THESE CURRENT

02:39:44.274 --> 02:39:46.076
FACILITIES IS INCLUDED IN

02:39:46.143 --> 02:39:48.211
EXISTING RATES.

02:39:48.278 --> 02:39:50.147
SO THIS WOULD NOT TO INCREASE

02:39:50.213 --> 02:39:52.316
THE COST FOR ANY RATE PAYER.

02:39:52.382 --> 02:39:54.117
SPECIFIC ACTION COULD ALSO BE

02:39:54.184 --> 02:39:55.285
TAKEN TO MAKE THESE CONTRACTS

02:39:55.352 --> 02:39:57.120
MORE EFFICIENT.

02:39:57.187 --> 02:39:58.322
BY ALLOWING FACILITIES TO TAKE

02:39:58.388 --> 02:40:00.223
MATERIAL FROM A BROADER RANGE OF

02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:03.393
HAZARD ZONES.

02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:04.261
THEY'RE ALSO SHUDDERED BIOMASS

02:40:04.328 --> 02:40:05.963
FACILITIES.

02:40:06.029 --> 02:40:07.497
BUT WE BROUGHT BACK ON LINE IN

02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:09.633
NINETY DAYS OR LESS WITH AN

02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:12.736
EXPANSION BIOMASS PROCUREMENT.

02:40:12.803 --> 02:40:13.704
AND PERHAPS THIS SHOULD ALSO BE

02:40:13.770 --> 02:40:16.073
CONSIDERED.

02:40:16.139 --> 02:40:17.374
YOU WILL HEAR FROM SOME THAT

02:40:17.441 --> 02:40:18.842
THERE ARE OTHER USES FOR THE

02:40:18.909 --> 02:40:21.111
BIOMASS MATERIAL.

02:40:21.178 --> 02:40:23.347
THINGS LIKE NEW WOOD PRODUCTS OR

02:40:23.413 --> 02:40:25.949
CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER.

02:40:26.016 --> 02:40:28.819
EVENTUALLY THAT MAY BE TRUE.

02:40:28.885 --> 02:40:30.187
BUT WE ARE STILL AT THE DAWN OF

02:40:30.253 --> 02:40:32.089
THAT TECHNOLOGY [inaudible]

02:40:32.155 --> 02:40:33.857

THE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ON

02:46:53.436 --> 02:46:54.571

PREDETERMINED PRICE CAP THAT

02:46:56.172 --> 02:46:57.841
REQUIRED ON A STALL OF THE

02:46:57.907 --> 02:46:59.109

02:46:59.175 --> 02:47:00.710
WHILE THE P. C. --

02:47:00.777 --> 02:47:02.078
EXAMINE THE PROGRAM TO SEE IF

02:47:02.145 --> 02:47:04.013
REFORMS COULD BE MADE --

02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:05.382
I TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT

02:47:05.448 --> 02:47:07.550
HOWEVER UNDER THAT ORDER WE ALSO

02:47:07.617 --> 02:47:08.985

HIGH HAZARD AREAS --

02:47:14.357 --> 02:47:15.658
TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN

02:47:15.725 --> 02:47:16.993
THE PRICE FOR THOSE FACILITIES

02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:20.730
COULD CONTINUE TO RATCHET UP --

02:47:20.797 --> 02:47:22.098
WHILE THE BIOMASS FACILITIES ARE

02:47:22.165 --> 02:47:24.534
MEETING THEIR TARGETS TODAY --

02:47:24.601 --> 02:47:27.470
BASED ON STATEMENTS FROM THE

ARE ON I'D THIS AND BY NO MEANS

02:47:50.026 --> 02:47:51.461
A COMPREHENSIVE LIST BUT

02:47:51.528 --> 02:47:53.663
COMPETITION FOR LIMITED AMOUNT

02:47:53.730 --> 02:47:54.297

ACTUALLY ACCESSIBLE CAN BE

02:48:02.238 --> 02:48:03.873
TRUCKED IN THESE FACILITIES IS

02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:04.974
STILL SOMEWHAT LIMITED.

02:48:05.041 --> 02:48:06.242
ON CHALLENGES AND FINDING A

02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:07.844
CONSISTENT SUPPLY OF HIGH HAZARD

02:48:12.415 --> 02:48:14.150
YOUNG SO IF THERE FUEL AND IT'S

02:48:14.217 --> 02:48:18.288
ONLY AND LOG ON TO REMOVE INSERT.

02:48:18.354 --> 02:48:19.756

02:48:19.823 --> 02:48:21.191
OTHER FUEL SOURCES OTHER TIMES

02:48:21.257 --> 02:48:22.258
OF THE YEAR --

02:48:22.325 --> 02:48:23.660
LACK OF ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE TO

02:48:23.726 --> 02:48:25.094
GET SAID SOME OF THE IMPACT

02:48:25.161 --> 02:48:26.463

02:48:28.431 --> 02:48:31.901
THEM TO THE BIOMASS FACILITIES --

02:48:31.968 --> 02:48:33.303
AND THEN IF THE TREE REMOVAL IS

02:48:33.369 --> 02:48:34.437
INCREASED --

02:48:34.504 --> 02:48:36.539
OVER THE LEVELS IT'S NOW A LACK

02:48:36.606 --> 02:48:37.707
OF SUFFICIENT STORAGE SPACE FOR

02:48:39.242 --> 02:48:40.844
TRYING OUT BEFORE CAN BE USED

02:48:40.910 --> 02:48:42.712
FOR BIOENERGY.

02:48:42.779 --> 02:48:44.314
ANOTHER CHALLENGE FACING MISTER

02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:46.082
IN THE YOU CAN YOU START TO

02:48:55.625 --> 02:48:57.026
TARGETS ARE MANDATES FOR BIOMASS

02:48:57.093 --> 02:48:58.495
PLANTS WILL NOT ACTUALLY HELP

02:48:58.561 --> 02:49:00.363
REMOVE THE FUEL FOR THE FORCE --

CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS INSTEAD OF

BIOMASS PROJECTS COMPARED TO

02:49:04.534 --> 02:49:06.002
OTHER RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND

02:49:06.069 --> 02:49:06.903
THIS PREMIUM MAY ACTUALLY BE

02:49:06.970 --> 02:49:08.471
JUSTIFIED GIVEN THE SOCIETAL

02:49:08.538 --> 02:49:09.772

02:49:09.839 --> 02:49:11.341
INVOLVED HERE --

02:49:11.407 --> 02:49:12.442
BUT IF THEY ARE PLAYING THE

02:49:12.509 --> 02:49:15.545
PREMIUM WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE --

02:49:15.612 --> 02:49:16.145
THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY MEETING

02:49:16.212 --> 02:49:18.982
THOSE GOALS ALL SORTS.

02:49:19.048 --> 02:49:20.850
ON IN SO ITIT SEEMS A MORE

02:49:20.917 --> 02:49:23.553
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IS NEEDED --

02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:26.956
BEYOND JUST DIRECTING UTILITIES --

02:49:27.023 --> 02:49:27.824
TO TO PROCURE MORE RESOURCES AND

02:49:27.891 --> 02:49:30.126

AYE WE'VE BEEN IN OPERATION

02:49:45.842 --> 02:49:47.911
SINCE ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY

02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:48.745

02:49:52.282 --> 02:49:53.750
THE STATE --

02:49:53.816 --> 02:49:54.951
SOME OF THE COLLABORATIVE GROUPS

02:49:55.018 --> 02:49:56.953
THAT ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT AND

02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:58.354
TRYING TO ADDRESS.

02:49:58.421 --> 02:50:00.523
A LARGE LANDSCAPE SOME UPWARDS

02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:02.158
OF A MILLION ACRES --

02:50:02.225 --> 02:50:04.794
AND THAT'S NOT THE NATURE OF MY

02:50:04.861 --> 02:50:06.229
DISCUSSION HERE TODAY BUT IT IS

02:50:06.296 --> 02:50:07.664
CRITICAL IN DEALING WITH SOME OF

02:50:07.730 --> 02:50:11.067
THESE LARGE LANDSCAPE ISSUES --

02:50:11.134 --> 02:50:14.704
WE ALSO HAVE --

02:50:14.771 --> 02:50:16.906
PAYROLL THIS SUMMER MANY OF WHOM

02:50:16.973 --> 02:50:18.107
ARE -- HIGH

SCHOOL KIDS FROM URBAN AREAS AND

02:50:20.777 --> 02:50:22.211
URBAN AIR OUT RURAL AREAS WERE

02:50:22.278 --> 02:50:23.680
BRINGING THEM TOGETHER TO DO

02:50:23.746 --> 02:50:25.715
RESTORATION WORK IN OUR FORESTS

02:50:25.782 --> 02:50:26.916
A LOT OF THAT WORK IS TAKING

02:50:26.983 --> 02:50:28.351
PLACE IN.

02:50:28.418 --> 02:50:30.687
THE STATE WATERSHED CRITICAL SO

OF THE UPPER FEATHER RIVER --

02:50:32.722 --> 02:50:34.490
THEY'RE DOING SOME AMAZING

02:50:34.557 --> 02:50:36.726
THINGS UP THERE --

02:50:36.793 --> 02:50:38.661

A SECOND BIOMASS BOILERS BEING

02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:55.445
DEVELOPED FOR A LOCAL HIGH

JAIL.

02:50:59.816 --> 02:51:01.184
THEY DON'T USE A LOT BUT THEY

02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:02.385
USE MATERIAL IN THEY BURNED IN

02:51:02.452 --> 02:51:03.786
ANY IN A CONFINED SPACE AND AS

02:51:03.853 --> 02:51:04.721
ALREADY MENTIONED.

02:51:04.787 --> 02:51:07.090
IT IS A CLEAN WAY OF UTILIZING

02:51:07.156 --> 02:51:09.692
THIS MATERIAL --

02:51:09.759 --> 02:51:11.828
ON TOP OF THAT WE BUILT THIS IS

02:51:11.894 --> 02:51:15.932
NOT MY SUITCASE THIS IS CROSSED

02:51:15.999 --> 02:51:17.133
LAMINATED TIMBER.

02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:18.801
ARE ALSO MORE GENERICALLY KNOWN

02:51:18.868 --> 02:51:20.503

02:51:20.570 --> 02:51:21.738
FIRST FULL.

02:51:21.804 --> 02:51:23.706
ACROSS LIMITED TIMBER STRUCTURE

02:51:23.773 --> 02:51:26.042
IN CALIFORNIA AND IT HOUSES ONE

02:51:26.109 --> 02:51:27.577
OF THE BIOMASS SPOILERS FOR THE

02:51:28.711 --> 02:51:30.246

02:51:30.313 --> 02:51:31.581
A RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY IN

02:51:31.648 --> 02:51:34.684
APRIL OF THIS YEAR --

02:51:34.751 --> 02:51:35.952
AND THAT JUST CONSTRUCTION

02:51:36.019 --> 02:51:37.754
PROJECT CONTRIBUTED OVER A

02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:38.321
MILLION DOLLARS TO THE LOCAL

02:51:38.388 --> 02:51:39.756
ECONOMY.

02:51:39.822 --> 02:51:41.824
SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT.

02:51:41.891 --> 02:51:44.227
UP THIS MORNING I SPENT THREE

02:51:44.293 --> 02:51:44.761
THREE AND A HALF HOURS IN

02:51:44.827 --> 02:51:46.829
JACKSON I'M A SOCIAL SCIENTIST

02:51:46.896 --> 02:51:47.730

HEALTH AND WELL BEING.

02:51:53.302 --> 02:51:54.771
AND THE CONVERSATION WAS

02:51:54.837 --> 02:51:56.339
FASCINATING BECAUSE THIS IS THE

02:51:56.406 --> 02:51:58.541
SAME AREA WHERE. THREE YEARS AGO

02:51:58.608 --> 02:52:00.710
THE BUTTE FIRE BURNED.

02:52:00.777 --> 02:52:02.879
SCARS REMAIN AND I MEAN NOT JUST

02:52:02.945 --> 02:52:05.081
ON THE LANDSCAPE THE SCARS

02:52:05.148 --> 02:52:06.416
REMAIN FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE

02:52:06.482 --> 02:52:07.717
COMMUNITY THE ANGUISH THE

02:52:07.784 --> 02:52:08.685
ECONOMIC.

02:52:08.751 --> 02:52:11.654
AYE DEVASTATION EXIST STILL

02:52:11.721 --> 02:52:12.989
TODAY IT WAS PART OF THE

02:52:13.056 --> 02:52:16.225
DISCUSSION THIS MORNING --

02:52:16.292 --> 02:52:18.394
MY BACKYARD IS A MENTION PLUMAS

02:52:18.461 --> 02:52:20.363
COUNTY NORTHERN SIERRA --

02:52:20.430 --> 02:52:22.899
THE MOONLIGHT FIRE BURNED THERE

02:52:22.965 --> 02:52:24.634
JUST ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS AGO I

02:52:24.701 --> 02:52:25.968
THOUGHT THAT FIRE IS A VOLUNTEER

02:52:26.035 --> 02:52:28.004
FIREFIGHTER SCARED THE HECK OUT

02:52:28.071 --> 02:52:30.306
OF ME OUT THERE AS I WAS DRIVING

02:52:30.373 --> 02:52:31.874
A TANKER TRUCK --

02:52:31.941 --> 02:52:34.143
PROVIDING WATER FOR SOME OF THE

02:52:34.210 --> 02:52:35.378
FRONTLINE ENGINES AND I REMEMBER

02:52:35.445 --> 02:52:37.313
THEM FROM BEING ST BERNARD DO

02:52:37.380 --> 02:52:38.614
YOU KNOW.

02:52:38.681 --> 02:52:40.450
ARIZONA AND ELSEWHERE

02:52:40.516 --> 02:52:40.750
[inaudible]

02:52:40.817 --> 02:52:44.187
UNFORTUNATELY THAT FIRE WAS

02:52:44.253 --> 02:52:46.189
CONSIDERED SMALL BY TODAY'S

02:52:46.255 --> 02:52:46.756
STANDARDS ON HUNDRED SQUARE

02:52:46.823 --> 02:52:47.990
MILES.

02:52:48.057 --> 02:52:50.593
BUT WHAT WAS UNIQUE TO THAT FIRE

02:52:50.660 --> 02:52:53.463
WAS THAT IT WAS A HIGH SEVERITY

02:52:53.529 --> 02:52:55.498
BURNED RELATIVE TO SOME OF THE

02:52:55.565 --> 02:52:58.034
AREAS OVER 60% OF THAT LANDSCAPE

02:52:58.101 --> 02:52:59.736
HAD A HIGH SEVERITY BURN.

02:52:59.802 --> 02:53:01.604
THE IMPLICATIONS AT THE RIM FIRE

02:53:01.671 --> 02:53:04.907
BY THE WAY WAS 40% IN CONTRAST.

02:53:04.974 --> 02:53:07.043
BUT WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED SINCE

02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:08.845
THEN SO ELEVEN YEARS AGO

02:53:08.911 --> 02:53:09.145
[inaudible]

02:53:09.212 --> 02:53:13.049
WITH DROUGHT WITH CLIMATE CHANGE --

02:53:13.116 --> 02:53:14.751
WE NOW HAVE WE BEEN LOOKING AT A

02:53:14.817 --> 02:53:17.019
BROWN LANDSCAPE FOR A LONG TIME.

02:53:17.086 --> 02:53:18.688
BUT WHAT WE'VE ALSO LEARNED IS

02:53:18.755 --> 02:53:22.391
WHAT WAS OLD FOREST. 40% 44% OLD

02:53:22.458 --> 02:53:24.360
FORCES NOW SHRUBLAND.

02:53:24.427 --> 02:53:25.795
WE WILL NOT SEE FOR US BACK

02:53:25.862 --> 02:53:26.763
THERE NOT IN MY LIFETIME NO

02:53:26.829 --> 02:53:32.869
MATTER WHAT WE DO --

02:53:32.935 --> 02:53:34.437
I WANT TO SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY.

02:53:34.504 --> 02:53:37.874
AND SPECIFICALLY ABOUT AB TWENTY

02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:38.875
FIVE EIGHTEEN ASSEMBLY.

02:53:38.941 --> 02:53:41.644

ON MASK MASK TIMBER.

02:53:50.753 --> 02:53:53.523
CONSTRUCTION IN SOME LOCATIONS --

02:53:53.589 --> 02:53:55.091
IT CALLS FOR SOME OTHER

02:53:55.158 --> 02:53:57.493
FACILITIES AND THESE ARE

02:53:57.560 --> 02:53:59.228
IMPORTANT IT IS A UNIQUE

02:53:59.295 --> 02:54:01.931
OPPORTUNITY TO UTILIZE.

02:54:01.998 --> 02:54:03.699
NOT JUST BIOMASS MORE MATERIAL

02:54:03.766 --> 02:54:06.736
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE IS

02:54:06.803 --> 02:54:07.904
SMALL MATERIAL THAT'S A PART OF

02:54:07.970 --> 02:54:09.605
THIS.

02:54:09.672 --> 02:54:11.574
SO IT CAN BE USED IN A PRODUCT

02:54:11.641 --> 02:54:13.576
THAT IS QUITE VALUABLE.

02:54:13.643 --> 02:54:14.944
WE BY THE WAY IN BUILDING THE

02:54:15.011 --> 02:54:16.045

02:54:16.112 --> 02:54:18.815
ALL OF TWO DAYS INSTRUCTING.

02:54:18.881 --> 02:54:20.550
AND THAT'S THE VALUE IN TERMS OF

02:54:20.616 --> 02:54:23.452
REDUCE LABOR AND THIS BY THE WAY

02:54:23.519 --> 02:54:25.922
IS A BIG PIECE OF CARBON.

02:54:25.988 --> 02:54:28.291
COMPARE --

02:54:28.357 --> 02:54:30.259

A TIME.

02:54:32.128 --> 02:54:34.197
OF THIS MATERIAL COMPARED TO

02:54:34.263 --> 02:54:36.432
STEAL.

02:54:36.499 --> 02:54:38.568
STEEL AMIDST TWENTY TIMES TWENTY

02:54:38.634 --> 02:54:40.102
ONE TIMES THE CARBON IN ITS

MANUFACTURE CEMENT [inaudible]

02:54:41.504 --> 02:54:44.574
EIGHT TIMES THE CARBON SO THAT

02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:46.509
DOESN'T EVEN COUNT THE CARBON

02:54:46.576 --> 02:54:49.212
DICK REGROWS ON THE LANDSCAPE.

02:54:49.278 --> 02:54:51.080
AS THE FOREST AS WHAT WAS TAKEN

02:54:51.147 --> 02:54:52.615
OUT IN THE FOREST RECOVERS THERE

02:54:52.682 --> 02:54:53.950
SO WE HAVE CARBON.

02:54:54.016 --> 02:54:56.052
ADDED ON THE LANDSCAPE.

02:54:56.118 --> 02:54:58.921
UMP THE IMPORTANCE AS I WRAP UP.

02:54:58.988 --> 02:55:01.390
CALIFORNIA'S LAGGING IN THIS IT

02:55:01.457 --> 02:55:04.594
UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF AB

02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:04.894

RIGHT AWAY THEY'VE DECIDED TO DO

02:55:21.377 --> 02:55:24.313
THAT ALABAMA MAIN ILLINOIS.

02:55:24.380 --> 02:55:25.915
BROUGHT IN CROSS LAMINATED

02:55:25.982 --> 02:55:28.718
TIMBER FACILITIES VERY RECENTLY.

02:55:28.784 --> 02:55:30.887
WE CAN'T DO BETTER WE GOT THIS

02:55:30.953 --> 02:55:32.622
MATERIAL WE HAD TO GET FROM

02:55:32.688 --> 02:55:35.791
CANADA. FOR THE BUILDING THAT WE

02:55:35.858 --> 02:55:37.593
CONSTRUCTED [inaudible]

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:39.462
SO LASTLY.

02:55:39.528 --> 02:55:41.430
WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED TO DO?

02:55:41.497 --> 02:55:43.232
I WANT TO MENTION ONE THING IS A

02:55:43.299 --> 02:55:45.301
SOCIAL SCIENTIST WE TALK ABOUT

02:55:45.368 --> 02:55:47.270
LANDSCAPE NEEDS.

02:55:47.336 --> 02:55:49.071
AND THERE ARE MANY.

02:55:49.138 --> 02:55:50.640
BUT TO BE EFFECTIVE DOING THE

02:55:50.706 --> 02:55:52.508
WORK ON THE LANDSCAPE WE ALSO

02:55:52.575 --> 02:55:54.577
HAVE TO HAVE PLACES TO BRING

02:55:54.644 --> 02:55:56.312
THAT MATERIAL.

02:55:56.379 --> 02:55:58.114
TO WE HAVE TO REBUILD SOME OF

02:55:58.180 --> 02:55:59.882
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE

02:55:59.949 --> 02:56:01.584
LOST OVER THE YEARS THAT'S A

02:56:01.651 --> 02:56:03.386
CRITICAL DIMENSION.

02:56:03.452 --> 02:56:05.254
OF THE PROBLEM WE FACE AS A

02:56:05.321 --> 02:56:07.523
STATE SO AGAIN THE LANDSCAPE

02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:09.292
ISSUES ARE ABSOLUTELY REAL WE

02:56:09.358 --> 02:56:11.227
KNOW THEM FIRSTHAND BUT TO DEAL

02:56:11.294 --> 02:56:11.928
WITH THAT.

02:56:11.994 --> 02:56:13.763
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT WE HAVE TO

02:56:13.829 --> 02:56:15.631
HAVE THE FACILITIES THAT WILL

02:56:15.698 --> 02:56:17.300
UTILIZE THIS MATERIAL THANK YOU

02:56:17.366 --> 02:56:20.636
VERY MUCH THANK YOU.

WILL NOW PROVIDE TESTIMONY ABOUT

02:56:48.464 --> 02:56:49.799
WHY BY MASS INCINERATION IS NOT

02:56:49.865 --> 02:56:51.367
A SOLUTION TO TREAT MORTALITY

02:56:51.434 --> 02:56:56.906
WILDFIRES WERE ENERGY NEED.

02:56:56.973 --> 02:56:58.541
PICK DOT ORG THANK GOD THANK YOU

TESTIFY TODAY.

02:57:01.310 --> 02:57:03.012
I WANT TO BE BEGAN BY SAYING

02:57:03.079 --> 02:57:04.714
THAT I FEEL DEEPLY FOR YOUR

02:57:04.780 --> 02:57:07.183
CONSTITUENTS WHO WERE EVACUATED

02:57:07.249 --> 02:57:08.451
OR WORSE YOU HAVE LOST HOMES AND

02:57:08.517 --> 02:57:10.086
NOT ONCE.

02:57:10.152 --> 02:57:11.354
I GREW UP IN COLORADO AND WAS

02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:12.688
EVACUATED FOR THE WHILE THOUGH

02:57:12.755 --> 02:57:14.223
CANYON FIRE.

02:57:14.290 --> 02:57:15.491
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT NOTHING

02:57:15.558 --> 02:57:17.293
IS MORE HORRIFYING THAN DRIVING

02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:18.361
AWAY FROM HER HOME.

02:57:18.427 --> 02:57:19.729
NOT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT

02:57:19.795 --> 02:57:21.430
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT AGAIN.

02:57:21.497 --> 02:57:23.199
BUT A VISCERAL FEAR FIRE HOWEVER

02:57:23.265 --> 02:57:25.568
JUSTIFIED CANNOT KEEP US FROM

02:57:25.634 --> 02:57:26.669
HAVING A ROBUST INFORMED

02:57:26.736 --> 02:57:28.637
DISCUSSION ABOUT FIRE FIRE

02:57:28.704 --> 02:57:29.605
MANAGEMENT AND BIOMASS

02:57:29.672 --> 02:57:31.440
UTILIZATION.

02:57:31.507 --> 02:57:32.975
THERE ARE A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE

02:57:33.042 --> 02:57:33.709
MILLION DEAD TREES AND

02:57:33.776 --> 02:57:35.778
CALIFORNIA'S FOREST.

02:57:35.845 --> 02:57:38.180
HOWEVER NOT ALL A HUNDRED TWENTY

02:57:38.247 --> 02:57:39.448
NINE MILLION TREES SHUT OR EVEN

02:57:39.515 --> 02:57:41.550
CAN BE REMOVED WE HEARD FROM THE

02:57:41.617 --> 02:57:42.418
CPUC.

02:57:42.485 --> 02:57:44.120
ABOUT HOW.

02:57:44.186 --> 02:57:45.421
VERY FEW OF THESE TREES ARE

02:57:45.488 --> 02:57:46.956
ACTUALLY ACCESSIBLE.

02:57:47.023 --> 02:57:48.324
MANY OF THESE TREES ARE IN

02:57:48.391 --> 02:57:50.059
REMOTE AREAS AND ACCESSING THAT

02:57:50.126 --> 02:57:51.927
WOULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE

02:57:51.994 --> 02:57:54.263
AN ECOLOGICALLY DESTRUCTIVE.

02:57:54.330 --> 02:57:55.765
ACCORDING TO A REVIEW OF THE

02:57:55.831 --> 02:57:57.933
LITERATURE BY YOU SEE BY THE UC

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.136
EXTENSION TO THE MENDOCINO FIRE

02:58:00.202 --> 02:58:02.538
SAFE COUNCIL IN.

02:58:02.605 --> 02:58:03.072
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FIRE

02:58:03.139 --> 02:58:04.640
PATHWAYS ARE NOT DRIVEN BY TREE

02:58:04.707 --> 02:58:07.176
MORTALITY NOR IS TO IMMORTALITY

02:58:07.243 --> 02:58:08.544
AT THE HEART OF FIRE ACTIVITY IN

02:58:08.611 --> 02:58:10.713
THE WEST.

02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:12.248
ALL THAT SAID THERE ARE DEAD

02:58:12.314 --> 02:58:13.816
TREES THAT ARE IN DANGER FALLING

02:58:13.883 --> 02:58:16.085
ON HOMES POWERLINES ROADS AND

02:58:16.152 --> 02:58:17.753
OTHER IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:18.921
AS WELL AS TREES THAT NEED TO BE

02:58:18.988 --> 02:58:21.624
REMOVED FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

02:58:21.690 --> 02:58:23.926
THESE TREES ARE TRULY HAZARDOUS

02:58:23.993 --> 02:58:25.661
AND MUST BE REMOVED THE QUESTION

02:58:25.728 --> 02:58:27.463
BECOMES WHAT DO WE DO WITH THESE

02:58:27.530 --> 02:58:29.098
TREES AND ALSO WHAT SHOULD WE

02:58:29.165 --> 02:58:30.866
NOT DO WITH THEM.

02:58:30.933 --> 02:58:32.501
CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT USE HATTER

02:58:32.568 --> 02:58:34.603
HAZARDOUS TREES TO PROP UP A

02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:35.805
POLLUTING AND NON ECONOMIC

02:58:35.871 --> 02:58:38.374
BIOMASS INCINERATION INDUSTRY.

02:58:38.441 --> 02:58:40.242
ON AVERAGE BIOMASS AND SAID

02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:42.511
FACILITIES AND IT. THREE TIMES

02:58:42.578 --> 02:58:44.680
MORE CO TWO PER MEGAWATT THE

02:58:44.747 --> 02:58:46.849
NATURAL GAS AND ONE AND A HALF

02:58:46.916 --> 02:58:48.818
TIMES MORE THAN EVEN CALL.

02:58:48.884 --> 02:58:50.453
BIOMASS INCINERATORS FOR LEASE

02:58:50.519 --> 02:58:52.488
FINE PARTICULATES AND KNOCKS IN

02:58:52.555 --> 02:58:54.523
HIGH CONCENTRATIONS.

02:58:54.590 --> 02:58:56.725
BOTH OF WHICH ARE LINKED. TO

02:58:56.792 --> 02:58:58.794
HEART AND LUNG CONDITIONS.

02:58:58.861 --> 02:59:00.262
MANY OF THESE FACILITIES

02:59:00.329 --> 02:59:01.831
INCLUDING ONE THAT IS CURRENTLY

02:59:01.897 --> 02:59:04.400
DO BURNING DEAD FOREST TREES ON

02:59:04.467 --> 02:59:05.935
AT BIO RAM CONTRACT.

02:59:06.001 --> 02:59:09.205
ARE LOCATED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:59:09.271 --> 02:59:11.207
FROM SCHOOLS AND NEIGHBORHOODS

02:59:11.273 --> 02:59:13.476
AND THESE FACILITIES ARE BURNING

02:59:13.542 --> 02:59:14.076
TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN

02:59:14.143 --> 02:59:16.112
DAYS A WEEK.

02:59:16.178 --> 02:59:17.246
CALIFORNIA SHOULD THINK OF

02:59:17.313 --> 02:59:18.514
BIOMASS UTILIZATION AS A

02:59:18.581 --> 02:59:20.116
HIERARCHY OF THE HIGHEST AND

02:59:20.182 --> 02:59:22.118
BEST USE FOR TREES.

02:59:22.184 --> 02:59:23.953
WHEN POSSIBLE A TREE CAN REMAIN

02:59:24.019 --> 02:59:25.721
A TREE EVEN SOME DEAD TREES

02:59:25.788 --> 02:59:27.456
PROVIDE INNUMERABLE ECOLOGICAL

02:59:27.523 --> 02:59:30.159
BENEFITS AND SEQUESTER CARBON?

02:59:30.226 --> 02:59:31.861
THEN WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE

02:59:31.927 --> 02:59:33.262
UTILIZATION THAT SEQUESTERS

02:59:33.329 --> 02:59:35.397
CARBON.

02:59:35.464 --> 02:59:37.366
BURNING TREES AND POWER PLANTS

02:59:37.433 --> 02:59:38.834
NEXT TO SCHOOLS AND IN

02:59:38.901 --> 02:59:41.337
NEIGHBORHOODS SHOULD NOT BE OUR

02:59:41.403 --> 02:59:43.539
SHOULD BE OUR VERY LAST CHOICE

02:59:43.606 --> 02:59:44.874
FOR BIOMASS UTILIZATION.

02:59:44.940 --> 02:59:47.076
NOT THE FIRST.

02:59:47.143 --> 02:59:49.311
WE MUST PRIORITIZE RESEARCH AND

02:59:49.378 --> 02:59:50.579
WE CANNOT KEEP INCINERATORS

02:59:50.646 --> 02:59:52.481
ONLINE AND SIMPLY SAYING THEY'RE

02:59:52.548 --> 02:59:55.017
SAYING THERE'S TOO MUCH WASTE.

02:59:55.084 --> 02:59:55.885
TO DEAL WITH.

02:59:55.951 --> 02:59:58.120
WE NEED EXTENSIVE RESEARCH INTO

02:59:58.187 --> 02:59:59.889
HOW MUCH WASTE THERE ACTUALLY IS

02:59:59.955 --> 03:00:01.257
IN THESE COMMUNITIES.

03:00:01.323 --> 03:00:02.992
AND THEN WHEN POSSIBLE AND

03:00:03.058 --> 03:00:04.927
PERMITTING COMMUNITY SCALE.

03:00:04.994 --> 03:00:07.329
BIOMASS UTILIZATION EFFORTS THAT

03:00:07.396 --> 03:00:09.665
ARE GOING TO THAT SEQUESTER AS

03:00:09.732 --> 03:00:10.866
MUCH CARBON AS POSSIBLE.

03:00:10.933 --> 03:00:14.136
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

03:00:14.203 --> 03:00:14.436
THANK YOU --

03:00:14.503 --> 03:00:16.238
WILL.

03:00:16.305 --> 03:00:17.439
I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR

03:00:17.506 --> 03:00:20.075
PRESENTATIONS ALL TURNED --

03:00:20.142 --> 03:00:22.711
TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

03:00:22.778 --> 03:00:23.012
[inaudible]

03:00:23.078 --> 03:00:25.080
STIR CALLING.

03:00:25.147 --> 03:00:25.614
SO I LIKE TO ASK YOU WHAT.

03:00:25.681 --> 03:00:27.383
THE FROM SIERRA CLUB WHAT WHAT

03:00:27.449 --> 03:00:28.751
WOULD YOU SUGGEST I TELL MY

03:00:28.817 --> 03:00:29.985
CONSTITUENTS HER BREATHE IN

03:00:30.052 --> 03:00:31.086
SMOKE EVERYDAY RIGHT NOW.

03:00:31.153 --> 03:00:32.354
WHAT IS THE SOLUTION IF WE DON'T

03:00:32.421 --> 03:00:34.456
WANNA?

03:00:34.523 --> 03:00:35.457
THEN ARE WE DON'T WANT TO DO

03:00:35.524 --> 03:00:37.226
ANYTHING WHO'S OR WALK AWAY FROM

03:00:37.293 --> 03:00:38.160
THE WHAT IS WHAT IS A AS I ONCE

03:00:38.227 --> 03:00:39.662
WAS A TOWN JUST GET THIS IS THE

03:00:39.728 --> 03:00:40.563
NEW NORMAN.

03:00:40.629 --> 03:00:43.399
WE WE'VE SEQUESTERED FIRE FOR A

03:00:43.465 --> 03:00:45.167
HUNDRED YEARS THAT'S NOT NORMAL.

03:00:45.234 --> 03:00:46.435
FIRE NOW ACTUALLY BURNED EVERY

03:00:46.502 --> 03:00:47.803
TEN TO TWELVE YEARS THE

03:00:47.870 --> 03:00:48.904
SCIENTISTS IS SITTING IN THE

03:00:48.971 --> 03:00:50.973
AUDIENCE WILL TELL YOU THAT.

03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:52.408
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST I BELIEVE

03:00:52.474 --> 03:00:54.476
THEIR RESEARCH BUT WE HAVE

03:00:54.543 --> 03:00:56.612
HISTORY THAT TREE MARKINGS SAY.

03:00:56.679 --> 03:00:58.314
FORCED BURNED EVERY TEN TO

03:00:58.380 --> 03:00:59.949
TWELVE YEARS WE STOP THAT MAN

03:01:00.015 --> 03:01:02.117
STOP THAT PROCESS.

03:01:02.184 --> 03:01:03.686
KIM PIMLOTT SPENT.

03:01:03.752 --> 03:01:04.753
THREE ALMOST THREE BILLION

03:01:04.820 --> 03:01:06.488
DOLLARS LAST YEAR FIGHTING FIRES

03:01:06.555 --> 03:01:07.356
TO STOP THAT PROCESS WHAT IS THE

03:01:07.423 --> 03:01:12.561
SOLUTION.

03:01:12.628 --> 03:01:14.463
FIRST OF ALL I ON ONE AT BEGAN

03:01:14.530 --> 03:01:16.232
BY SAYING --

03:01:16.298 --> 03:01:17.533
THAT.

03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:19.969
IT IS IMPORTANT. TO TO PROTECT

03:01:20.035 --> 03:01:21.737
COMMUNITIES AND PROTECT TOWNS

03:01:21.804 --> 03:01:22.805
AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT.

03:01:22.871 --> 03:01:24.373
WOULD LIKE THE LEGISLATURE TO

03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:26.508
PRIORITIZE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND

03:01:26.575 --> 03:01:28.477
PRIORITIZE HARDENING OF HOMES

03:01:28.544 --> 03:01:28.777
[inaudible]

03:01:28.844 --> 03:01:30.546
ADDITIONALLY.

03:01:30.613 --> 03:01:32.014
I'M WHILE.

03:01:32.081 --> 03:01:34.516
IT IS A JARRING TO SEE ALL THE

03:01:34.583 --> 03:01:36.685
SMOKE AND I'M SURE IT'S STRONG

03:01:36.752 --> 03:01:38.187
FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

03:01:38.254 --> 03:01:40.256
AND IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

03:01:40.322 --> 03:01:41.890
WHERE THERE ARE SIX BIOMASS

03:01:41.957 --> 03:01:44.827
FACILITIES CURRENTLY OPERATING.

03:01:44.893 --> 03:01:46.662
THEY HAVE THAT KIND OF AIR

03:01:46.729 --> 03:01:47.296
QUALITY EVERYDAY.

03:01:47.363 --> 03:01:48.364
AND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE

03:01:48.430 --> 03:01:49.865
DAYS A YEAR.

03:01:49.932 --> 03:01:51.800
AND IF WE CONTINUE [inaudible]

03:01:51.867 --> 03:01:54.536
BURNING --

03:01:54.603 --> 03:01:56.105
TAKING THE WASTE FROM THE

03:01:56.171 --> 03:01:57.873
SIERRAS AND BURNING IT DOWN ON

03:01:57.940 --> 03:01:59.475
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I'M NOT

03:01:59.541 --> 03:02:00.843
THINK THAT'S VERY FAIR TO THAT

03:02:00.909 --> 03:02:03.345
ON CONSTITUENTS AND THE PEOPLE

03:02:03.412 --> 03:02:07.249
LIVING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

03:02:07.316 --> 03:02:08.183
SO YOUR SUGGESTION WOULD BE THE

03:02:08.250 --> 03:02:11.520
END OPEN BURN.

03:02:11.587 --> 03:02:14.990
THAT'S ALSO AND CRACKED AND I DO

03:02:15.057 --> 03:02:16.859
NOT THINK IT'S VERY FAIR TO

03:02:16.925 --> 03:02:18.627
COMPARE THE EMISSIONS OF THE

03:02:18.694 --> 03:02:21.563
BIOMASS INCINERATOR TO THAT.

03:02:21.630 --> 03:02:23.399
ON OPEN BURNING OR FOREST FIRE

03:02:23.465 --> 03:02:25.267
THAT'S THAT'S THESE UTILIZATION

03:02:25.334 --> 03:02:27.036
CONVERSATIONS THAT I THINK ARE

03:02:27.102 --> 03:02:28.070
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AT THE

03:02:28.137 --> 03:02:31.407
GOVERNOR ALLOCATED ON TWO POINT

03:02:31.473 --> 03:02:32.808
TWO MILLION DOLLARS.

03:02:32.875 --> 03:02:34.643
TO THAT SET THE BAR EXTREMELY

03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:36.712
LOW FOR THOSE UTILIZATION CON I

03:02:36.779 --> 03:02:38.480
CONVERSATIONS IF WE JUST SAY.

03:02:38.547 --> 03:02:39.782
WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE BIOMASS

03:02:39.848 --> 03:02:42.017
UTILIZATION THAT IS CLEANER THAN

03:02:42.084 --> 03:02:44.620
FOREST FIRES IN OPEN BURNING.

03:02:44.687 --> 03:02:46.422
THAT CANNOT BE THE SOLUTION.

03:02:46.488 --> 03:02:47.890
SO I THINK WE NEED TO AGAIN

03:02:47.956 --> 03:02:49.892
PRIORITIZE RESEARCH PRIORITIZE

03:02:49.958 --> 03:02:52.094
INNOVATION AND IF WE PROP UP

03:02:52.161 --> 03:02:54.229
BIOMASS FACILITIES FOR THE END

03:02:54.296 --> 03:02:56.031
UNFORESEEABLE FUTURE WE'LL NEVER

03:02:56.098 --> 03:02:57.199
GET TO A REALITY.

03:02:57.266 --> 03:02:59.835
WHERE WE HAVE CLEAN ALTERNATIVES

03:02:59.902 --> 03:03:02.905
THAT TO BUY MASS INCINERATION?

03:03:02.971 --> 03:03:04.606
WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

03:03:04.673 --> 03:03:07.109
AND I JUST WANNA SAY REALITY IS

03:03:07.176 --> 03:03:07.409
[inaudible]

03:03:07.476 --> 03:03:08.811
IT'S BURDEN.

03:03:08.877 --> 03:03:10.245
AND IT'S GONNA OPEN BURN WHETHER

03:03:10.312 --> 03:03:11.480
WE DO ANYTHING OR NOT AND HAD IT

03:03:11.547 --> 03:03:15.284
IT'S LIKE. TO ME OBAMA'S PLANET.

03:03:15.351 --> 03:03:16.552
IS A GIANT MOUSE ON A FORCE FIRE

03:03:16.618 --> 03:03:17.619
YOU JUST TAKE IT OUT AND PUT IT

03:03:17.686 --> 03:03:19.088
IN THERE AND YOU ACTUALLY DO

03:03:19.154 --> 03:03:20.422
WHAT WE DO WITH.

03:03:20.489 --> 03:03:22.558
COMBUSTIBLE ENGINES WE PUT

03:03:22.624 --> 03:03:23.525
DIFFERENT KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY ON

03:03:23.592 --> 03:03:25.527
A SO WE REDUCE.

03:03:25.594 --> 03:03:27.062
THE EMISSIONS THAT COME OUT SO I

03:03:27.129 --> 03:03:28.530
FIND IT REALLY FASCINATING THAT

03:03:28.597 --> 03:03:30.199
TIME.

03:03:30.265 --> 03:03:32.167
HERE WE CAN WE CAN SIT HERE AND

03:03:32.234 --> 03:03:33.769
AND AND AND HAVE THIS DISCUSSION

03:03:33.836 --> 03:03:34.770
WE TALK ABOUT STREAMLINING

03:03:34.837 --> 03:03:36.739
PROCESS WE TALK ABOUT TRYING TO

03:03:36.805 --> 03:03:38.374
ACTUALLY PROACTIVELY.

03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:40.175
AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY OF COME TO

03:03:40.242 --> 03:03:42.077
SOME SORT OF A SOLUTION TO

03:03:42.144 --> 03:03:44.947
SOMETHING THAT MAN CREATED.

03:03:45.013 --> 03:03:46.849
AND WE CREATED THIS SITUATION BY

03:03:46.915 --> 03:03:47.416
EXTINGUISHING FIRE THAT NOW

03:03:47.483 --> 03:03:48.884
ACTUALLY.

03:03:48.951 --> 03:03:51.520
SEND OUT A LOT OF THIS BIOMASS

03:03:51.587 --> 03:03:52.588
SO -- WOULD

03:03:52.654 --> 03:03:54.123
BE GREAT TO HAVE A SOLUTION

03:03:54.189 --> 03:03:55.824
OTHER THAN JUST GOING BACK TO

03:03:55.891 --> 03:03:57.226
THE SAME THING WHEN I ASKED THE

03:03:57.292 --> 03:03:59.728
QUESTION THAT WE CAN'T HAVE.

03:03:59.795 --> 03:04:00.429
THIS BIOMASS PLANT IN THE

03:04:00.496 --> 03:04:01.630
CENTRAL ALLEY WHETHER THERE ARE

03:04:01.697 --> 03:04:03.699
MANY SHATTERED PLANTS ALL OVER

03:04:03.766 --> 03:04:05.234
THE STATE THAT ARE.

03:04:05.300 --> 03:04:06.602
NOT IN USE THAT WE COULD USE

03:04:06.668 --> 03:04:08.837
THIS MATERIAL AND AS A SHORT

03:04:08.904 --> 03:04:10.372
TERM AT LEAST PREVENTIVE

03:04:10.439 --> 03:04:11.540
MAINTENANCE FOR THE SHORT TERM

03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:12.541
UNTIL WE COME UP WITH WHATEVER

03:04:12.608 --> 03:04:13.709
THAT SOLUTION IS THAT YOU'RE

03:04:13.776 --> 03:04:15.077
TRYING TO TELL ME THAT.

03:04:15.144 --> 03:04:16.478
I HAVE HEARD A SOLUTION BUT I'D

03:04:16.545 --> 03:04:17.746
LIKE TO HAVE A LEASE SOMETHING I

03:04:17.813 --> 03:04:18.847
KNOW WORKS TODAY THANK YOU VERY

03:04:18.914 --> 03:04:20.215
MUCH.

03:04:20.282 --> 03:04:22.985
THANK YOU SIR DUCKS.

03:04:23.051 --> 03:04:25.020
YEAH THANK YOU ARM I AM.

03:04:25.087 --> 03:04:26.555
I THINK THE MESSAGE WAS THAT

03:04:26.622 --> 03:04:28.023
THIS.

03:04:28.090 --> 03:04:29.191
MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THAT

03:04:29.258 --> 03:04:31.126
ANSWER.

03:04:31.193 --> 03:04:32.795
AND I TO SHARE CONCERNED THAT I

03:04:32.861 --> 03:04:35.097
WANT AN ANSWER.

03:04:35.164 --> 03:04:37.166
WE NEED ANSWERS BOB BIOMASS IS

03:04:37.232 --> 03:04:38.834
SOMETHING THEY HAVE USED --

03:04:38.901 --> 03:04:41.637
IN THE PAST IT'S PRESENTED AS AN

03:04:41.703 --> 03:04:43.205
OPTION -- I

03:04:43.272 --> 03:04:45.874
WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT ITS COST

03:04:45.941 --> 03:04:49.311
AND A LITTLE A CONCERNED AS WELL

03:04:49.378 --> 03:04:50.746
ABOUT -- ITS

03:04:50.813 --> 03:04:52.014
EMISSIONS.

03:04:52.080 --> 03:04:54.049
IF IT EMITS MORE THAN NATURAL

03:04:54.116 --> 03:04:56.218
GAS AND ONE AND A HALF TIMES --

03:04:56.285 --> 03:04:57.252
MORE THAN --

03:04:57.319 --> 03:04:59.922
COAL FOR ITS PRODUCTION.

03:04:59.988 --> 03:05:02.157
THAT WORRIES ME BUT I THINK.

03:05:02.224 --> 03:05:04.259
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS SOME

03:05:04.326 --> 03:05:05.394
ANSWERS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH

03:05:05.461 --> 03:05:06.829
THESE PROBLEMS AND I WOULD LIKE

03:05:06.895 --> 03:05:08.063
TO GO BACK?

03:05:08.130 --> 03:05:10.933
IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

03:05:10.999 --> 03:05:12.234
TO OTHER DISCUSSIONS WE HAD

03:05:12.301 --> 03:05:15.270
EARLIER THERE ARE SOME ANSWERS --

03:05:15.337 --> 03:05:18.173
WE DO NEED TO HARDEN OUR HOMES --

03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:21.443
AND WE DO NEED TO BRING OUR BEST

03:05:21.510 --> 03:05:21.944
AND OUR BRIGHTEST PEOPLE

03:05:22.010 --> 03:05:25.180
TOGETHER. TO TAKE A LOOK AT ALL

03:05:25.247 --> 03:05:26.815
THOSE OPTIONS AND PUT THEM INTO

03:05:26.882 --> 03:05:28.517
PLACE.

03:05:28.584 --> 03:05:30.686
AND I AGREE THAT FOR THE LAST

03:05:30.752 --> 03:05:31.620
HUNDRED YEARS WE'VE HAD A

03:05:31.687 --> 03:05:32.921
PHILOSOPHY IN THIS STATE THAT

03:05:32.988 --> 03:05:34.256
SAYS THE BURNING IS NOT THE

03:05:34.323 --> 03:05:36.024
ANSWER.

03:05:36.091 --> 03:05:38.660
WE NOW FIND OURSELVES WITH FOR

03:05:38.727 --> 03:05:40.629
MORE BURN A BULL COMBUSTIBLE

03:05:40.696 --> 03:05:42.764
MATERIAL THAN WE HAD EXPECTED

03:05:42.831 --> 03:05:45.067
AND A CLIMATE CHANGE WHERE.

03:05:45.133 --> 03:05:47.603
THE AVERAGE HUMIDITY FOR THE

03:05:47.669 --> 03:05:49.638
CURRENT FIRES HAS BEEN ADDED I'M

03:05:49.705 --> 03:05:51.240
TOLD 5%.

03:05:51.306 --> 03:05:53.542
THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY NUMBERS

03:05:53.609 --> 03:05:56.545
SO WE HAVE. ZERO THAT'S NEVER

03:05:56.612 --> 03:05:58.447
BEEN SO DRY WE HAVE AIR THAT'S

03:05:58.514 --> 03:06:00.249
NEVER BEEN SO DRY WE HAVE

03:06:00.315 --> 03:06:01.316
HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR WINDS.

03:06:01.383 --> 03:06:03.051
WE ARE EXPERIENCING SOMETHING

03:06:03.118 --> 03:06:05.220
THAT I DON'T THINK WE

03:06:05.287 --> 03:06:08.056
ANTICIPATED FIFTY YEARS AGO --

03:06:08.123 --> 03:06:10.559
BUT WE HEAR.

03:06:10.626 --> 03:06:12.060
AND I THINK I IT WOULD BE

03:06:12.127 --> 03:06:14.696
HELPFUL IF WE DID HAVE --

03:06:14.763 --> 03:06:16.265
SOME DISCUSSION I KNOW WE'RE

03:06:16.331 --> 03:06:17.833
TALKING ABOUT RESEARCH AND WHAT

03:06:17.900 --> 03:06:19.768
HAVE YOU AND WHILE THOSE ARE

03:06:19.835 --> 03:06:20.736
HELPFUL AND HOPEFULLY THEIR NEW

03:06:20.802 --> 03:06:22.504
TECHNOLOGIES COMING ABOUT EVERY

03:06:22.571 --> 03:06:24.106
DAY THAT WILL --

03:06:24.172 --> 03:06:26.808
HELP US MOVE FORWARD --

03:06:26.875 --> 03:06:28.343
THE IDEA TO YOU TALK ABOUT

03:06:28.410 --> 03:06:30.145
PRIORITIZING DEFENSIBLE SPACE

03:06:30.212 --> 03:06:32.314
PRIORITIZING AND HARDENING ARE

03:06:32.381 --> 03:06:33.649
HOMES AND I THINK THOSE ARE

03:06:33.715 --> 03:06:35.684
LEGITIMATE CONCERNS --

03:06:35.751 --> 03:06:36.318
AND WE AND THOSE ARE PRIORITIES

03:06:36.385 --> 03:06:38.453
TO THAT -- I

03:06:38.520 --> 03:06:40.389
AM HOPEFUL.

03:06:40.455 --> 03:06:41.590
THAT WE ARE NOW BRINGING

03:06:41.657 --> 03:06:43.191
TOGETHER THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST

03:06:43.258 --> 03:06:44.359
PEOPLE FROM A LOT OF THE

03:06:44.426 --> 03:06:45.394
LEGISLATIVE --

03:06:45.460 --> 03:06:48.497
PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME FROM --

03:06:48.564 --> 03:06:49.831
COLLEAGUES OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE

03:06:49.898 --> 03:06:51.867
ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS SOME THAT WE

03:06:51.934 --> 03:06:53.969
HAVE PROPOSED IN THE SENATE --

03:06:54.036 --> 03:06:56.038
WORKING WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY

03:06:56.104 --> 03:06:58.140
COMPETENCY OF OUR CAL FIRE

03:06:58.206 --> 03:06:59.775
PEOPLE NOT ONLY IN FIGHTING

03:06:59.841 --> 03:07:02.010
FIRES BUT ALSO IN WORKING TO

03:07:02.077 --> 03:07:03.278
PREVENT THEM SO.

03:07:03.345 --> 03:07:05.280
I APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL HERE

03:07:05.347 --> 03:07:07.015
I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS EXCITES

03:07:07.082 --> 03:07:08.550
ME AS I'D HOPED.

03:07:08.617 --> 03:07:10.953
GIVEN THE DOWNSIDES TO IT AND

03:07:11.019 --> 03:07:12.087
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

03:07:12.154 --> 03:07:13.488
INDEED A LOT OF THESE TREES WERE

03:07:13.555 --> 03:07:15.757
NEVER GOING TO GET TWO HUNDRED

03:07:15.824 --> 03:07:16.758
TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES SOME

03:07:16.825 --> 03:07:18.860
OF THEM IN OBSCURE AREAS.

03:07:18.927 --> 03:07:20.162
I LOVE THE IDEA BOB PERHAPS

03:07:20.228 --> 03:07:23.198
EXPANDING OUR CONSERVATION CORPS.

03:07:23.265 --> 03:07:25.233
AND HAVING A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE --

03:07:25.300 --> 03:07:27.736
HELPING US I'M NOT SURE THOUGH --

03:07:27.803 --> 03:07:28.770
THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE

03:07:28.837 --> 03:07:30.105
COULD LOOK IT UP BUT THAT

03:07:30.172 --> 03:07:31.740
THERE'S NO ONE ANSWER TO THIS

03:07:31.807 --> 03:07:33.508
PROBLEM AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED

03:07:33.575 --> 03:07:34.576
TO DO IS.

03:07:34.643 --> 03:07:36.912
CONSIDER ALL THE OPTIONS AND

03:07:36.979 --> 03:07:38.547
THEN I WANT TO THANK A IN SPITE

03:07:38.614 --> 03:07:39.481
OF THE FACT THERE ARE TWO NEW

03:07:39.548 --> 03:07:41.316
WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN HERE AND I

03:07:41.383 --> 03:07:42.884
THINK THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF

03:07:42.951 --> 03:07:44.686
STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED

03:07:44.753 --> 03:07:46.588
WITH THAT WHETHER IT'S IN OUR

03:07:46.655 --> 03:07:50.726
FIRE AGENCIES OR OF TALK.

03:07:50.792 --> 03:07:52.828
TO ACHIEVE PIMLOTT ABOUT THAT ON

03:07:52.894 --> 03:07:53.629
MORE THAN ONE OCCASION I CAN

03:07:53.695 --> 03:07:54.997
ASSURE YOU --

03:07:55.063 --> 03:07:57.165
WE REALLY DO NEED TO BRING

03:07:57.232 --> 03:07:58.800
TOGETHER THE GREAT IDEAS AT US

03:07:58.867 --> 03:08:00.469
OTHER STATES HAVE DONE TAKE A

03:08:00.535 --> 03:08:01.637
LOOK AT THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF

03:08:01.703 --> 03:08:03.005
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US IN

03:08:03.071 --> 03:08:03.839
CALIFORNIA.

03:08:03.905 --> 03:08:05.374
THEN TAKE THE SCIENCE IN THE

03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:07.242
EXPERTISE AND MOVE THIS BALL

03:08:07.309 --> 03:08:09.277
FORWARD OUTGOING FOR NOW I WOULD

03:08:09.344 --> 03:08:10.846
LIKE -- THAT

03:08:10.912 --> 03:08:12.180
THE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY

03:08:12.247 --> 03:08:13.882
BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION AND

03:08:13.949 --> 03:08:15.217
SOLUTION AS WELL.

03:08:15.283 --> 03:08:16.852
SO WITH THAT I I THANK YOU FOR

03:08:16.918 --> 03:08:18.453
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THOSE

03:08:18.520 --> 03:08:22.124
THOUGHTS.

03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:23.725
NO DISRESPECT FOR ALYSSA

03:08:23.792 --> 03:08:26.561
PROTECTS TAKES TO BEAUTY EQUAL

03:08:26.628 --> 03:08:29.931
ONE CATHERINE PHILLIPS

03:08:29.998 --> 03:08:30.232
[inaudible]

03:08:30.298 --> 03:08:32.968
THROUGH ITS --

03:08:33.035 --> 03:08:33.568
FIRST BY POACHERS I'D STEPPED

03:08:33.635 --> 03:08:34.236
OUT SO IF THIS WAS ANSWERED MY

03:08:34.302 --> 03:08:36.972
APOLOGIES BUT QUESTION ABOUT IS

03:08:37.039 --> 03:08:38.173
HERE -- IS

03:08:38.240 --> 03:08:40.108
THERE ANY DATA ABOUT THE LEVEL

03:08:40.175 --> 03:08:42.177
OF ADMISSIONS FROM BIOMASS

03:08:42.244 --> 03:08:43.679
VERSES OPEN BURNING I THINK.

03:08:43.745 --> 03:08:45.213
MISS I THINK SOMEBODY MAY HAVE

03:08:45.280 --> 03:08:47.816
ALLUDED TO THAT.

03:08:47.883 --> 03:08:49.284
YEAH I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THE

03:08:49.351 --> 03:08:50.452
QUESTION --

03:08:50.519 --> 03:08:51.953
IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES

03:08:52.020 --> 03:08:53.889
DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF DIRECT

03:08:53.955 --> 03:08:55.490
COMBUSTION THAT HAS EMISSIONS

03:08:55.557 --> 03:08:57.125
CONTROL EQUIPMENT AND WHEN WE

03:08:57.192 --> 03:08:58.427
START TALKING ABOUT.

03:08:58.493 --> 03:09:00.862
GASIFICATION PROCESS SEE SOME OF

03:09:00.929 --> 03:09:02.330
THOSE ARE EVEN CLEANER.

03:09:02.397 --> 03:09:11.440
SO IT'S CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND

03:09:11.506 --> 03:09:12.007
THAT IT'S THERE'S A HUNDRED

03:09:12.074 --> 03:09:12.240
TIMES.

03:09:12.307 --> 03:09:12.808
DIFFERENCE AND SO THE OTHER

03:09:12.874 --> 03:09:13.475
THING IS THAT WE TALK OUGHT TO

03:09:13.542 --> 03:09:13.975
BIOMASS OR NOT MASS I

03:09:14.042 --> 03:09:14.643
HOPE WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE

03:09:14.710 --> 03:09:15.210
WE ALSO ARE TALKING ABOUT.

03:09:15.277 --> 03:09:17.345
OTHER PRODUCTS THAT CAN MAKE A

03:09:17.412 --> 03:09:18.513
DIFFERENCE WHERE WE'RE TAKING

03:09:18.580 --> 03:09:20.882
SMALL MATERIAL WE CAN MAKE POLLS

03:09:20.949 --> 03:09:23.318
WE CAN MAKE OTHER MATERIALS AND

03:09:23.385 --> 03:09:25.053
THEN WERE WERE ACTUALLY.

03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:27.222
DEVELOPING VALUE ADDED PRODUCTS

03:09:27.289 --> 03:09:29.458
WHICH CREATE EMPLOYMENT

03:09:29.524 --> 03:09:30.726
OPPORTUNITIES CREATE WORK

03:09:30.792 --> 03:09:32.527
OPPORTUNITIES ALL FOREST WASTE

03:09:32.594 --> 03:09:34.096
IS NOT WASTE.

03:09:34.162 --> 03:09:35.997
IT CAN BE USED IN DIFFERENT WAYS

03:09:36.064 --> 03:09:37.999
CHIPS ARE JUST ONE WAY AND I'M

03:09:38.066 --> 03:09:39.067
NOT SAYING THAT WE SHOULDN'T

03:09:39.134 --> 03:09:40.235
HAVE SOME BIOMASS OPPORTUNITIES

03:09:40.302 --> 03:09:41.737
A SERIOUS STUDENTS LOOKING AT

03:09:41.803 --> 03:09:42.437
THAT.

03:09:42.504 --> 03:09:43.905
AS ARE MANY OTHER --

03:09:43.972 --> 03:09:46.007
OF OUR PARTNERS SO THERE ARE

03:09:46.074 --> 03:09:47.676
DIFFERENT PROCESSES AND I THINK

03:09:47.743 --> 03:09:49.644
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

03:09:49.711 --> 03:09:50.679
WE ARE NOW ON TO THE NEXT

03:09:50.746 --> 03:09:53.615
GENERATION OF BIOMASS FACILITIES.

03:09:53.682 --> 03:09:55.016
TO ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT THE

03:09:55.083 --> 03:09:57.586
BY ON THAT PROCESS AND THE

03:09:57.652 --> 03:09:58.553
ELEVEN TWENTY TWO PROJECTS THAT

03:09:58.620 --> 03:10:00.155
ARE COMING ON SO.

03:10:00.222 --> 03:10:03.458
BIOMASS BIOMASS BOILERS FAR FAR

03:10:03.525 --> 03:10:05.160
CLEANER THAN JUST OPEN FILE

03:10:05.227 --> 03:10:09.164
BERNIE.

03:10:09.231 --> 03:10:10.632
THIS EPISODE REMEMBER WOULD GIVE

03:10:10.699 --> 03:10:11.867
IT MIGHT --

03:10:11.933 --> 03:10:14.536
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD.

03:10:14.603 --> 03:10:16.738
PUTS IT SIMPLY THIS WAY.

03:10:16.805 --> 03:10:19.541
BIOMASS ENERGY IS 98% LESS

03:10:19.608 --> 03:10:20.742
POLLUTING THAN WILD FIRE OR

03:10:20.809 --> 03:10:24.246
CONTROLLED BURNS.

03:10:24.312 --> 03:10:26.782
IF I COULD.

03:10:26.848 --> 03:10:28.016
QUALIFY TO THROUGH THINGS HERE

03:10:28.083 --> 03:10:29.684
JUST TO NOTE SO ONE THING YOU

03:10:29.751 --> 03:10:31.052
NOTED THERE WAS MUCH CLEANER IS

03:10:31.119 --> 03:10:32.487
GASIFICATION --

03:10:32.554 --> 03:10:34.790
BUT WE ARE RIGHT NOW TALKING

03:10:34.856 --> 03:10:36.124
ABOUT GASIFICATION OF THE FUEL

03:10:36.191 --> 03:10:37.092
WERE TALKING ABOUT TAKING THE

03:10:37.159 --> 03:10:38.493
FUEL PUTTING IN A TRUCK IN

03:10:38.560 --> 03:10:40.929
SHIPPING --

03:10:40.996 --> 03:10:42.497
I I DO THINK A LOT OF ARE AND DO

03:10:42.564 --> 03:10:43.899
YOU NEED TO BE DONE AROUND

03:10:43.965 --> 03:10:46.935
GASIFICATION ON MOST OF THE COST

03:10:47.002 --> 03:10:48.603
OF SHIPPING BIOMASS IS ACTUALLY

03:10:48.670 --> 03:10:50.205
SHIPPING WATER THE WOOD HAS LOTS

03:10:50.272 --> 03:10:51.673
OF WATER IN A THAT OBVIOUSLY IS

03:10:51.740 --> 03:10:52.808
NOT.

03:10:52.874 --> 03:10:54.409
COMBUSTION EVER BUT YOU HAVE TO

03:10:54.476 --> 03:10:56.111
PAY FOR THE WEIGHT OF THAT THE

03:10:56.178 --> 03:10:57.646
MORE WE CAN DO RESEARCH.

03:10:57.712 --> 03:11:00.048
TO REDUCE THOSE COSTS --

03:11:00.115 --> 03:11:01.249
THE MORE YOU'RE GONNA LOWER THE

03:11:01.316 --> 03:11:04.319
OVERALL COST OF THE BIOMASS IN

03:11:04.386 --> 03:11:06.421
POTENTIALLY THE OVERALL MISSION --

03:11:06.488 --> 03:11:07.789
MOSTLY NOW SAYS INACTION NOT

03:11:07.856 --> 03:11:10.358
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT --

03:11:10.425 --> 03:11:13.261
A HEARTBEAT DID.

03:11:13.328 --> 03:11:13.829
TOO ASSUMED FOR THE TRUCKING

03:11:13.895 --> 03:11:16.064
BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS WE'VE DONE

03:11:16.131 --> 03:11:18.767
ON GHG EMISSIONS --

03:11:18.834 --> 03:11:20.869
LOOKING AT IT COMPARED TO OTHER

03:11:20.936 --> 03:11:22.737
RENEWABLE OR OTHER ON ENERGY

03:11:22.804 --> 03:11:24.372
RESOURCES --

03:11:24.439 --> 03:11:26.041
WHICH IS DIFFERENT.

03:11:26.107 --> 03:11:29.544
BUT ONCE YOU GET BEYOND TWENTY

03:11:29.611 --> 03:11:30.946
TO THIRTY MILES OF SHIFTING THE

03:11:31.012 --> 03:11:32.514
ADMISSIONS FROM THE TRUCKING GET

03:11:32.581 --> 03:11:33.582
SO HIGH.

03:11:33.648 --> 03:11:35.450
THAT THAT STARTS TO DRIVE IT OUT

03:11:35.517 --> 03:11:36.718
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS IS

03:11:36.785 --> 03:11:38.687
BIOMASS IS A SOLUTION FOR GHG WE

03:11:38.753 --> 03:11:40.322
ALSO HAVE TO FOCUS ON BIOMASS

03:11:40.388 --> 03:11:42.457
BEING CLOSE TO THE FUEL SOURCE

03:11:42.524 --> 03:11:43.158
AND NOT LONG --

03:11:43.225 --> 03:11:45.227
TRUCK.

03:11:45.293 --> 03:11:46.695
BUT IF I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK

03:11:46.761 --> 03:11:48.463
I THINK I THINK WE RECOGNIZE WE

03:11:48.530 --> 03:11:50.365
RECOGNIZE THAT AS WELL BUT BUT

03:11:50.432 --> 03:11:52.033
SHOULD WE NOT I MEAN LOOK I AM

03:11:52.100 --> 03:11:53.435
NOT LOOKING AT BIOMASS AS THE

03:11:53.501 --> 03:11:54.936
SAVIOR FOR THE ENERGY INDUSTRY

03:11:55.003 --> 03:11:55.971
HERE OKAY.

03:11:56.037 --> 03:11:57.505
I'M NOT NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THAT

03:11:57.572 --> 03:11:59.774
BUT WE HAVE A DISPOSAL ISSUE FOR

03:11:59.841 --> 03:12:02.110
GOING TO BE DOING MANAGEMENT.

03:12:02.177 --> 03:12:04.913
SO IF WE DO NOT CREATE USE IT

03:12:04.980 --> 03:12:06.047
FOR AT THROUGH THROUGH THE PILE

03:12:06.114 --> 03:12:08.984
TO BIOMASS AS AN ENERGY SOURCE.

03:12:09.050 --> 03:12:10.485
AND WE LEAVE IT IN THE FOREST

03:12:10.552 --> 03:12:12.053
IT'S STILL RELEASES METHANE

03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:13.755
WHICH IS A SHORT TERM POP

03:12:13.822 --> 03:12:16.124
CLIMATE POLLUTANTS SO SO.

03:12:16.191 --> 03:12:17.926
YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT HAD WE

03:12:17.993 --> 03:12:19.194
YOU KNOW WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT ALL

03:12:19.261 --> 03:12:20.629
THE NUMBERS HERE TO REALLY FIND

03:12:20.695 --> 03:12:22.097
OUT FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WHAT'S

03:12:22.163 --> 03:12:24.399
REALLY REALLY COST EFFICIENT --

03:12:24.466 --> 03:12:25.667
IN YOU MENTIONED YOU MENTIONED

03:12:25.734 --> 03:12:26.534
SOMETHING THAT YOU AND I

03:12:26.601 --> 03:12:27.969
APOLOGIZE I WAS TRYING TO FOLLOW

03:12:28.036 --> 03:12:28.970
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

03:12:29.037 --> 03:12:30.372
THE THREE MEGAWATTS A FIVE

03:12:30.438 --> 03:12:32.340
MEGAWATT BIOMASS PLANTS AND AND

03:12:32.407 --> 03:12:34.709
ST YOU TALK ABOUT STEVE'S ABOUT

03:12:34.776 --> 03:12:35.043
STREAMLINING.

03:12:35.110 --> 03:12:37.178
THINGS.

03:12:37.245 --> 03:12:38.146
YEAH THERE'S THERE'S TWO THINGS

03:12:38.213 --> 03:12:39.547
IN THEIR ONE AND I THINK IF

03:12:39.614 --> 03:12:40.448
YOU'RE WELL AWARE --

03:12:40.515 --> 03:12:42.350
THERE IS LEGISLATION --

03:12:42.417 --> 03:12:44.519
FOR THE BIO MAT PROGRAM TO MOVE

03:12:44.586 --> 03:12:46.154
THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM'S FROM

03:12:46.221 --> 03:12:47.289
THREE MEGAWATTS FROM THREE MEG

03:12:47.355 --> 03:12:48.590
WHAT THE FIVE MEGAWATT.

03:12:48.657 --> 03:12:51.760
ON THAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED ON

03:12:51.826 --> 03:12:53.662
FOR BIO MAP FACILITIES --

03:12:53.728 --> 03:12:56.464
YET THEY NOW CAN BE UP TO FIVE

03:12:56.531 --> 03:12:58.466
MEGAWATTS INCISORS A RESTRICTION

03:12:58.533 --> 03:12:59.267
ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN EXPORT TO

03:12:59.334 --> 03:13:00.101
THE GRID.

03:13:00.168 --> 03:13:01.636
ON BY STATUTE BUT THE FACILITY

03:13:01.703 --> 03:13:02.871
ITSELF CAN BE FIVE MEGAWATTS

03:13:02.938 --> 03:13:04.973
INSIDE THE OTHER STREAMLINING

03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:06.441
ISSUE [inaudible]

03:13:06.508 --> 03:13:08.877
I'M IS.

03:13:08.944 --> 03:13:10.211
ONGOING AND LEAST AND IN MY

03:13:10.278 --> 03:13:12.347
WORLD SEEMING ALMOST NEVER

03:13:12.414 --> 03:13:12.948
ENDING IS THE STREAMLINING OF

03:13:13.014 --> 03:13:14.582
THE INTERCONNECTION.

03:13:14.649 --> 03:13:15.684
I MEAN THIS IS A TRUE JUST FOR

03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:17.886
BIOMASS IT'S TRUE --

03:13:17.953 --> 03:13:19.220
FOR ALL SMALLER DISTRIBUTED

03:13:19.287 --> 03:13:20.922
GENERATION OUT THERE THAT THE

03:13:20.989 --> 03:13:21.823
INTERCONNECTION PROCESS TO THE

03:13:21.890 --> 03:13:25.593
GRADE -- IS

03:13:25.660 --> 03:13:27.896
[inaudible] FOR SMALL

03:13:27.963 --> 03:13:29.331
UNSOPHISTICATED DEVELOPERS

03:13:29.397 --> 03:13:31.633
HAVEN'T BEEN IN THEENERGY --

03:13:31.700 --> 03:13:32.867
INDUSTRY FOR A LONG TIME CAN BE

03:13:32.934 --> 03:13:35.236
VERY COMPLICATED --

03:13:35.303 --> 03:13:36.972
AND HAS A LOT OF STEPS TO IT IN

03:13:37.038 --> 03:13:38.139
A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN SO THEY

03:13:38.206 --> 03:13:41.042
CAN YOU SEE FOR MANY YEARS NOW

03:13:41.109 --> 03:13:42.210
HAS BEEN TAKING.

03:13:42.277 --> 03:13:44.479
YEAH STEPS THROUGH YOUR FIRST

03:13:44.546 --> 03:13:46.114
TRYING TO FIND COMPROMISES AMONG

03:13:46.181 --> 03:13:48.116
ALL THE PARTIES TO STREAMLINE IT

03:13:48.183 --> 03:13:50.952
AND NOW MOVING MORE --

03:13:51.019 --> 03:13:51.987
TO NO TOUGHER DECISIONS OUT

03:13:52.053 --> 03:13:54.122
THERE WE'VE ALSO ADDED STAFF I

03:13:54.189 --> 03:13:55.490
THINK THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR

03:13:55.557 --> 03:13:56.891
FOR GIVING US MORE STAFF WHO ARE

03:13:56.958 --> 03:13:59.127
FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON

03:13:59.194 --> 03:14:00.462
INTERCONNECTION INTERCONNECTION

03:14:00.528 --> 03:14:02.097
DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

03:14:02.163 --> 03:14:05.834
ON SO THAT WE CAN BETTER ON

03:14:05.900 --> 03:14:07.335
NAVIGATE WHEN THERE ARE THIS

03:14:07.402 --> 03:14:09.170
DISPUTE RESOLUTIONS BUT AT THE

03:14:09.237 --> 03:14:10.739
END OF THE DAY.

03:14:10.805 --> 03:14:11.873
I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

03:14:11.940 --> 03:14:13.074
THE SMALLER FACILITIES ARE GOING

03:14:13.141 --> 03:14:14.642
TO FACE --

03:14:14.709 --> 03:14:16.578
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE CLOSE TO THE

03:14:16.644 --> 03:14:18.813
FUEL SOURCE ARE USUALLY NOT

03:14:18.880 --> 03:14:20.281
CLOSE -- TO

03:14:20.348 --> 03:14:22.150
ROBUST DISTRIBUTION SAYS.

03:14:22.217 --> 03:14:23.585
IT'S IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE

03:14:23.651 --> 03:14:24.986
PROCESS TO INTERCONNECT AND

03:14:25.053 --> 03:14:28.089
THAT'S IN THE YOU KNOW --

03:14:28.156 --> 03:14:28.656
TWO TO THREE MILLION DOLLAR

03:14:28.723 --> 03:14:29.958
RANGE FOR THE INTERCONNECTIONS

03:14:30.025 --> 03:14:31.926
AND THAT CAN DRIVE.

03:14:31.993 --> 03:14:32.560
THAT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE OF

03:14:32.627 --> 03:14:35.430
THESE PROJECTS BEEN PROFITABLE.

03:14:35.497 --> 03:14:36.765
WHEN I GO BACK TO A COMMENT MADE

03:14:36.831 --> 03:14:38.066
IN EARLY HEARING IN A WEEK WE

03:14:38.133 --> 03:14:40.068
HAD A VERY SMALL BUILD TWEAK

03:14:40.135 --> 03:14:41.469
PART OF THE SYSTEM?

03:14:41.536 --> 03:14:43.271
FORCED WAITS ON STREAMLINING IS

03:14:43.338 --> 03:14:45.206
IT WHILE IT WAS THE WAY TO YEARS

03:14:45.273 --> 03:14:47.409
FOR THE RAGS ON THAT SO.

03:14:47.475 --> 03:14:48.810
I'M LOOKING FOR THE MORE.

03:14:48.877 --> 03:14:50.111
STREAMLINING.

03:14:50.178 --> 03:14:51.780
QUITE FRANKLY YEAH ON ONE THING

03:14:51.846 --> 03:14:55.016
I CAN SAY ON THAT IS THE THE

03:14:55.083 --> 03:14:56.684
PIECE OF THE BILL THAT YOU'RE

03:14:56.751 --> 03:14:58.019
LOOKING BACK ON IMPLEMENTED VERY

03:14:58.086 --> 03:14:59.654
QUICKLY --

03:14:59.721 --> 03:15:01.790
WE ALSO GOT CAUGHT IN A FEDERAL

03:15:01.856 --> 03:15:04.059
LAWSUIT UNRELATED TO THE BIO MAT

03:15:04.125 --> 03:15:05.326
PROGRAM --

03:15:05.393 --> 03:15:06.528
AND THAT --

03:15:06.594 --> 03:15:08.263
ON P. YOU SEE WHICH SUIT ON A

03:15:08.329 --> 03:15:10.632
PROGRAM IT'S CALLED REMAPPED --

03:15:10.698 --> 03:15:12.434
THAT THE FEDERAL COURT LOOKED AT

03:15:12.500 --> 03:15:13.835
IN THIS TOOK MANY YEARS TO MOVE

03:15:13.902 --> 03:15:15.170
THROUGH FOR IN THE FEDERAL

03:15:15.236 --> 03:15:17.238
COURTS AND US AND VERY RECENTLY

03:15:17.305 --> 03:15:19.541
LAST DECEMBER FEDERAL COURT AND

03:15:19.607 --> 03:15:20.942
SAN FRANCISCO SAID.

03:15:21.009 --> 03:15:22.811
STATES REMAPPED PROGRAM VIOLATES

03:15:22.877 --> 03:15:24.446
FEDERAL LAW.

03:15:24.512 --> 03:15:26.815
IN ISSUED AN ORDER AGAINST US TO

03:15:26.881 --> 03:15:28.116
STOP ALL CONTRACTS UNDER THAT

03:15:28.183 --> 03:15:29.717
PROGRAM.

03:15:29.784 --> 03:15:31.753
THE CHALLENGE WE FACE IS THE BIO

03:15:31.820 --> 03:15:33.621
MAT PROGRAM IN STATUTE

03:15:33.688 --> 03:15:33.922
[inaudible]

03:15:33.988 --> 03:15:38.093
IS 1100% BASED ON THE REMATCH.

03:15:38.159 --> 03:15:39.894
SO THAT THEN CAUSED US TO HAVE

03:15:39.961 --> 03:15:42.230
TO STOP AND GO SLOWLY AND MOVE

03:15:42.297 --> 03:15:44.232
FORWARD VERY SLOWLY FOR A COUPLE

03:15:44.299 --> 03:15:45.200
MONTHS TO AVOID FUTURE

03:15:45.266 --> 03:15:46.367
LITIGATION.

03:15:46.434 --> 03:15:47.635
ON THE BIO MAT PROGRAM NOW I

03:15:47.702 --> 03:15:48.770
THINK WE'RE AT THE POINT NOW

03:15:48.837 --> 03:15:50.238
WHERE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH

03:15:50.305 --> 03:15:51.239
THE BY ON THAT PROGRAM WHICH

03:15:51.306 --> 03:15:52.740
SEPARATED ENOUGH FROM THE WE MAP

03:15:52.807 --> 03:15:54.309
OF RAM --

03:15:54.375 --> 03:15:56.644
BUT IT DID CREATE --

03:15:56.711 --> 03:15:58.113
A BIG BECAUSE IT THE COMMISSION

03:15:58.179 --> 03:15:59.447
ON A NUMBER OF THINGS WE WERE

03:15:59.514 --> 03:16:00.048
TRYING TO DO IN THE EARLY PART

03:16:00.115 --> 03:16:03.918
OF THIS YEAR --

03:16:03.985 --> 03:16:05.620
MY FINAL QUESTION JUST OF THIS

03:16:05.687 --> 03:16:08.189
YEAR SIERRA CLUB FOLKS.

03:16:08.256 --> 03:16:09.457
IS THE ENVIRONMENT OTHER IS

03:16:09.524 --> 03:16:11.226
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY FLATLY

03:16:11.292 --> 03:16:13.261
OPPOSED TO BIOMASS [inaudible]

03:16:13.328 --> 03:16:16.331
BORIS.

03:16:16.397 --> 03:16:19.067
UP I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE

03:16:19.134 --> 03:16:20.301
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY.

03:16:20.368 --> 03:16:21.903
UP THAT I CAN TELL YOU THAT

03:16:21.970 --> 03:16:24.305
THERE IS ON LARGE SCALE

03:16:24.372 --> 03:16:27.142
ESPECIALLY NATIONALLY --

03:16:27.208 --> 03:16:29.577
LARGE SCALE OPPOSITION. TO OUT

03:16:29.644 --> 03:16:31.946
BY A MASS INCINERATION AND AND

03:16:32.013 --> 03:16:33.915
IN FACT THAT LIKE I MENTIONED

03:16:33.982 --> 03:16:35.917
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AIR QUALITY

03:16:35.984 --> 03:16:37.285
COALITION HAD A LOBBY DAY.

03:16:37.352 --> 03:16:39.020
I JUST A WEEK AGO AND THIS IS

03:16:39.087 --> 03:16:40.221
ONE OF THEIR KEY ISSUES THAT

03:16:40.288 --> 03:16:41.389
THEY BROUGHT INTO --

03:16:41.456 --> 03:16:42.690
TO LEGISLATOR SO IT'S DEFINITELY

03:16:42.757 --> 03:16:43.825
A CONCERN [inaudible]

03:16:43.892 --> 03:16:46.261
ARMONK.

03:16:46.327 --> 03:16:47.762
VAST SWATHS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

03:16:47.829 --> 03:16:52.200
COMMUNITY [inaudible]

03:16:52.267 --> 03:16:54.702
OKAY -- OKAY

03:16:54.769 --> 03:16:56.604
THANK YOU I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU

03:16:56.671 --> 03:16:58.273
TO MAYBE DRIVE NORTH AND SEE

03:16:58.339 --> 03:16:59.574
WHAT IT'S LIKE TWENTY MILES FROM

03:16:59.641 --> 03:17:01.743
HERE AND KEEP GOING.

03:17:01.809 --> 03:17:02.343
SEE WHAT FORCE FIRES ARE DOING

03:17:02.410 --> 03:17:06.014
AND THANK YOU [inaudible]

03:17:06.080 --> 03:17:08.783
MISSOURI'S.

03:17:08.850 --> 03:17:11.352
SO I LOOKED HER.

03:17:11.419 --> 03:17:13.254
I JUST WISH THAT I I DO WANT TO

03:17:13.321 --> 03:17:15.323
COMMENT THAT THE CHIEF --

03:17:15.390 --> 03:17:17.292
PIMLOTT.

03:17:17.358 --> 03:17:18.459
THE THINGS HE MENTIONED.

03:17:18.526 --> 03:17:20.895
WAS THAT FIRE PREVENTION AND

03:17:20.962 --> 03:17:22.197
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS OR BY

03:17:22.263 --> 03:17:23.665
MAIL PROTECTIONS.

03:17:23.731 --> 03:17:26.467
ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

03:17:26.534 --> 03:17:27.368
AND I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER

03:17:27.435 --> 03:17:29.804
THAT OTHERS A LONG HISTORY OF

03:17:29.871 --> 03:17:31.573
NOT JUST THIS YEAR CLUB BUT MANY

03:17:31.639 --> 03:17:32.941
OF THE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL

03:17:33.007 --> 03:17:35.009
GROUPS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.

03:17:35.076 --> 03:17:36.177
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE'S BREATHING

03:17:36.244 --> 03:17:37.779
WE ARE DEALING WITH SOMETHING

03:17:37.845 --> 03:17:40.048
VERY DIFFERENT NOW AND WE DO

03:17:40.114 --> 03:17:41.616
HAVE TO RE EVALUATE?

03:17:41.683 --> 03:17:43.751
ALL OF THE DETAILS.

03:17:43.818 --> 03:17:45.753
I THINK THAT WE ARE CHARGED WITH

03:17:45.820 --> 03:17:47.655
MAKING DIFFICULT.

03:17:47.722 --> 03:17:50.959
SOLUTIONS IT DIFFICULT PROPOSALS.

03:17:51.025 --> 03:17:53.394
NOT PERFECT PROPOSALS.

03:17:53.461 --> 03:17:57.332
AND I I I I KNOW THAT IF WE WERE

03:17:57.398 --> 03:17:57.832
TO PUT TOGETHER PERFECT

03:17:57.899 --> 03:17:58.433
PROPOSALS.

03:17:58.499 --> 03:17:59.467
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WOULD BE

03:17:59.534 --> 03:18:01.069
ON THIS ON THIS.

03:18:01.135 --> 03:18:02.804
PART OF THIS GROUP SO I DO AGREE

03:18:02.870 --> 03:18:05.506
WITH THE CENTER JACKSON THAT.

03:18:05.573 --> 03:18:07.408
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE ALL

03:18:07.475 --> 03:18:10.011
STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE SO THE

03:18:10.078 --> 03:18:13.381
WE DISCUSS THESE ISSUES SO THAT.

03:18:13.448 --> 03:18:15.617
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS NOT?

03:18:15.683 --> 03:18:18.286
IT IS SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

03:18:18.353 --> 03:18:20.221
THAT HAS TO BE DEALT WITH AYE IF

03:18:20.288 --> 03:18:21.756
IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE.

03:18:21.823 --> 03:18:24.392
IN THE FOREST RATHER THAN HAVING

03:18:24.459 --> 03:18:27.462
TO TRANSPORT THE THE THE THE THE

03:18:27.528 --> 03:18:29.631
BIOMASS --

03:18:29.697 --> 03:18:31.666
IF IT'S DONE WITHIN IT WITHIN

03:18:31.733 --> 03:18:34.002
THE AREA MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING

03:18:34.068 --> 03:18:35.803
TO LOOK AT THERE ARE LOTS OF

03:18:35.870 --> 03:18:38.439
LOTS OF POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AND

03:18:38.506 --> 03:18:39.540
AGAIN WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR

03:18:39.607 --> 03:18:41.109
PERFECT SOLUTIONS.

03:18:41.175 --> 03:18:42.010
BUT WE DO HAVE TO COME UP WITH

03:18:42.076 --> 03:18:43.878
THE BEST SOLUTIONS TO TAKE CARE

03:18:43.945 --> 03:18:45.947
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE

03:18:46.014 --> 03:18:47.815
AFFECTING US RIGHT NOW.

03:18:47.882 --> 03:18:48.349
BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING SO

03:18:48.416 --> 03:18:50.118
SERIOUS AND WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR

03:18:50.184 --> 03:18:54.622
SOME SOLUTION [inaudible]

03:18:54.689 --> 03:18:56.557
THIS MAYES.

03:18:56.624 --> 03:18:58.593
I THINK HIS CHAIR OUT.

WHEN DOWN THAT CHIEF HIM UP THAT

03:19:07.602 --> 03:19:08.469
WHAT WHAT WAS HERE AND I KNOW

03:19:14.876 --> 03:19:16.110
SOME BILLS THAT HE'S INTRODUCED

03:19:16.177 --> 03:19:17.245
OVER THE YEARS.

03:19:17.312 --> 03:19:19.013
AND WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:20.248
SCIENCE IS THERE.

03:19:20.315 --> 03:19:22.884
IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT WE HAVE

03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:23.951
OVERGROWN FORESTS IN

03:19:24.018 --> 03:19:24.652
CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL

03:19:24.719 --> 03:19:26.187
COMMUNITY.

03:19:26.254 --> 03:19:27.755
DO DO YOU GUYS BELIEVE THAT WE

03:19:27.822 --> 03:19:29.390
HAVE OVERGROWN FORESTS IN IN

03:19:29.457 --> 03:19:35.530
CALIFORNIA.

03:19:35.596 --> 03:19:36.698
AGAIN -- I

03:19:36.764 --> 03:19:38.399
CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE

03:19:38.466 --> 03:19:39.734
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY.

03:19:39.801 --> 03:19:41.235
AND I AM MYSELF NOT A FOREST

03:19:41.302 --> 03:19:42.270
ECOLOGIST [inaudible]

03:19:42.337 --> 03:19:45.373
AND IT'S ALL THE OF THAT ANSWER

03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:47.175
AT THAT.

03:19:47.241 --> 03:19:48.543
BUT NO I I DON'T KNOW.

03:19:48.609 --> 03:19:49.310
SO.

03:19:49.377 --> 03:19:50.812
THE SIERRA CLUB DOESN'T TAKE A

03:19:50.878 --> 03:19:52.547
POSITION AT ALL IN REGARDS TO

03:19:52.613 --> 03:19:53.514
WHETHER WE HAVE OVERGROWN FOR

03:19:53.581 --> 03:19:54.582
SOME OF THE SIERRA CLUB.

03:19:54.649 --> 03:19:55.383
IS ONE OF THE MOST STORIED

03:19:55.450 --> 03:19:58.820
ADVOCACY IN THIS COUNTRY.

03:19:58.886 --> 03:20:00.421
AND SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO

03:20:00.488 --> 03:20:01.656
BOTH OUR PUBLIC LANDS ARE

03:20:01.723 --> 03:20:02.557
PRIVATE LANDS ARE YOU SAYING

03:20:02.623 --> 03:20:03.691
THAT THE SIERRA CLUB DOES NOT

03:20:03.758 --> 03:20:04.826
TAKE A POSITION.

03:20:04.892 --> 03:20:05.827
IN REGARDS TO WHETHER WE HAVE

03:20:05.893 --> 03:20:08.496
OVERGROWN FORESTS.

03:20:08.563 --> 03:20:12.367
AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING THAT --

03:20:12.433 --> 03:20:13.501
I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME

03:20:13.568 --> 03:20:15.203
DISAGREEMENT ON HOW WE SHOULD

03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:17.472
MANAGE THOSE FORESTS AND

03:20:17.538 --> 03:20:19.040
DEFINITELY WE NOW.

03:20:19.107 --> 03:20:20.475
WE AGREE THAT THERE ARE THERE'S

03:20:20.541 --> 03:20:21.542
BEEN YEARS AND YEARS OF FIRE

03:20:21.609 --> 03:20:24.178
SUPPRESSION THE FORCE ARE OVER

03:20:24.245 --> 03:20:26.381
GROUND I THINK SIERRA CLUB.

03:20:26.447 --> 03:20:28.950
WE TAKE A DIFFERENT LOOK AT ON

03:20:29.016 --> 03:20:30.952
FORCE MANAGEMENT FIRE MANAGEMENT

03:20:31.018 --> 03:20:33.521
BUT I'M THE BIOMASS ORGANIZER

03:20:33.588 --> 03:20:36.491
NOT A FORCE MANAGEMENT EXPERTS.

03:20:36.557 --> 03:20:37.592
IT DIDN'T AND OF COURSE THE

03:20:37.658 --> 03:20:39.060
REASON WHY I'M ASKING IS QUITE

03:20:39.127 --> 03:20:40.461
WISH WE HAD SOMEBODY COME FROM

03:20:40.528 --> 03:20:41.629
YOUR ORGANIZATIONALLY SOMEWHAT

03:20:41.696 --> 03:20:42.730
FROM ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

03:20:42.797 --> 03:20:44.132
COMMUNITY THEN THAT BOMB. FOR

03:20:44.198 --> 03:20:46.667
YEARS HAS BEEN ADVOCATING THAT

03:20:46.734 --> 03:20:47.935
WE DON'T TOUCH NAM ARE ARE ARE

03:20:48.002 --> 03:20:49.337
BOTH PUBLIC LANDS AND AND

03:20:49.404 --> 03:20:50.238
PRIVATE LANDS.

03:20:50.304 --> 03:20:52.140
WE HAVE PROBLEMS NOW BECAUSE

03:20:52.206 --> 03:20:53.841
BECAUSE OF THAT.

03:20:53.908 --> 03:20:54.909
YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS IN

03:20:54.976 --> 03:20:56.444
REGARDS TO THIS PARTICULAR

03:20:56.511 --> 03:20:57.945
PROBLEM AND WE TALK ABOUT --

03:20:58.012 --> 03:20:59.614
INVERSE CONDEMNATION WHICH WE'VE

03:20:59.680 --> 03:21:00.181
ALREADY HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS

03:21:00.248 --> 03:21:01.482
ABOUT.

03:21:01.549 --> 03:21:03.217
THE STATE TAKES SOME LIABILITY

03:21:03.284 --> 03:21:05.186
AS WELL IT'S NOT JUST CLIMATE

03:21:05.253 --> 03:21:06.687
CHANGE ALTHOUGH I DO THINK THAT

03:21:06.754 --> 03:21:08.089
WE DO HAVE A DIFFERENT CLIMATE

03:21:08.156 --> 03:21:10.024
TODAY AND I'VE I'M SOMEBODY AS A

03:21:10.091 --> 03:21:10.892
REPUBLICAN WHO BELIEVES THAT

03:21:10.958 --> 03:21:12.226
CLIMATE CHANGE.

03:21:12.293 --> 03:21:14.462
I'M ISRAEL AND WE HAVE TO BEGIN

03:21:14.529 --> 03:21:15.296
TO DEAL WITH --

03:21:15.363 --> 03:21:16.297
WITH WITH DO WITH TO DEAL WITH

03:21:16.364 --> 03:21:17.999
THAT.

03:21:18.065 --> 03:21:19.300
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO COME

03:21:19.367 --> 03:21:21.135
TO GRIPS THE FACT THE STATE.

03:21:21.202 --> 03:21:22.437
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AND IT

03:21:22.503 --> 03:21:24.138
COULD BE IT COULD BE THAT AS

03:21:24.205 --> 03:21:26.307
ELECTED OFFICIALS WE HAVEN'T HAD

03:21:26.374 --> 03:21:28.509
THE COURAGE TO BE ABLE TO STAND

03:21:28.576 --> 03:21:30.111
UP TO SOME FOLKS TO SAY ENOUGH

03:21:30.178 --> 03:21:31.612
IS ENOUGH.

03:21:31.679 --> 03:21:33.548
SO THE QUESTION FOR ME IS ARE WE

03:21:33.614 --> 03:21:35.817
GOING TO TODAY STAND UP BECAUSE

03:21:35.883 --> 03:21:37.251
JUST LIKE DOCTOR WHAT TALKED

03:21:37.318 --> 03:21:38.920
ABOUT IN HIS DISTRICT HE'S GOT

03:21:38.986 --> 03:21:39.520
FOLKS.

03:21:39.587 --> 03:21:41.489
THAT HAVE FEARED FOR THEIR LIVES

03:21:41.556 --> 03:21:43.357
IF PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED HERE IN

03:21:43.424 --> 03:21:45.092
THE STATE BECAUSE OF THAT

03:21:45.159 --> 03:21:46.594
BECAUSE OF OVERGROWN FORESTS AND

03:21:46.661 --> 03:21:47.929
IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT WE CAN'T

03:21:47.995 --> 03:21:49.497
COME TO FACT.

03:21:49.564 --> 03:21:51.232
WE CAN'T COME TO GRIPS WITH THE

03:21:51.299 --> 03:21:52.900
SCIENCE AND THE SCIENCE SAYS

03:21:52.967 --> 03:21:54.702
THAT WE HAVE OVERGROWN FORCE IT

03:21:54.769 --> 03:21:56.270
WOULD BE GREAT.

03:21:56.337 --> 03:21:58.473
IT WOULD BE GREAT.

03:21:58.539 --> 03:22:00.641
IT WOULD BE GREAT AS A A AS A

03:22:00.708 --> 03:22:02.443
COMMUNITY AND IT WOULD BE GREAT

03:22:02.510 --> 03:22:03.277
IF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

03:22:03.344 --> 03:22:04.612
COMMITTEE ALONG WITH OTHERS

03:22:04.679 --> 03:22:05.580
WOULD LOOK AT THE SCIENCE AND

03:22:05.646 --> 03:22:06.147
SAY.

03:22:06.214 --> 03:22:07.782
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH IT'S TIME TO

03:22:07.849 --> 03:22:09.116
START GETTING SOME OF THOSE

03:22:09.183 --> 03:22:10.384
FUELS OUT AND PART OF THE REASON

03:22:10.451 --> 03:22:11.953
I WANT TO POINT THIS OUT IS THAT

03:22:12.019 --> 03:22:13.488
WE HAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY YOU

03:22:13.554 --> 03:22:14.822
SAID THIS A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE

03:22:14.889 --> 03:22:15.389
MILLION.

03:22:15.456 --> 03:22:17.391
DEAD TREES IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S

03:22:17.458 --> 03:22:19.660
A LOT INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

03:22:19.727 --> 03:22:20.495
RESOURCES IT WOULD TAKE TO BE

03:22:20.561 --> 03:22:21.829
ABLE.

03:22:21.896 --> 03:22:23.564
TO THE CLEAR TO CLEAR THOSE.

03:22:23.631 --> 03:22:24.632
AND YET WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE

03:22:24.699 --> 03:22:26.300
DEAD AND DYING TREES BECAUSE WE

03:22:26.367 --> 03:22:27.735
HAVEN'T CLEARED ENOUGH WHAT DO

03:22:27.802 --> 03:22:31.506
YOU DO WITH ALL OF THAT.

03:22:31.572 --> 03:22:32.707
IT'S WASTE WHAT DO YOU DO WITH

03:22:32.773 --> 03:22:34.375
ALL OF THAT FUEL WE'VE GOT TO DO

03:22:34.442 --> 03:22:35.643
SOMETHING WITH ITS OF BIOMASS

03:22:35.710 --> 03:22:37.211
ISN'T THE ANSWER.

03:22:37.278 --> 03:22:39.113
THEIR WHAT IS THE ANSWER WHAT WE

03:22:39.180 --> 03:22:44.952
EAT WHAT WE DO ABOUT THAT.

03:22:45.019 --> 03:22:45.520
AND AND I LET ME JUST SAY I

03:22:45.586 --> 03:22:46.454
THINK THAT.

03:22:46.521 --> 03:22:47.989
THOSE ARE ALL FAIR QUESTIONS I

03:22:48.055 --> 03:22:49.357
THINK THOUGH THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

03:22:49.423 --> 03:22:51.025
TO NOTE THAT OUR PANELS ARE PUT

03:22:51.092 --> 03:22:53.828
TOGETHER WITH ADVOCATES FROM

03:22:53.895 --> 03:22:55.663
VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEWS AND AND

03:22:55.730 --> 03:22:57.899
SOME OF THEIR POSITIONS OR GOING

03:22:57.965 --> 03:22:59.767
TO BE SORT OF BASED ON THEIR

03:22:59.834 --> 03:23:00.801
THEIR PRISON AND HOW THEY SEE IT.

03:23:00.868 --> 03:23:04.505
HOW WE ULTIMATELY GET?

03:23:04.572 --> 03:23:06.274
S. WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD IS

03:23:06.340 --> 03:23:07.542
REALLY FOR US TO TAKE THE

03:23:07.608 --> 03:23:08.509
INFORMATION.

03:23:08.576 --> 03:23:10.511
AND THEN YIELD TO WHERE WE THINK

03:23:10.578 --> 03:23:11.812
IS THE BEST PATH.

03:23:11.879 --> 03:23:13.514
A TO ADDRESS.

03:23:13.581 --> 03:23:15.283
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT

03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.883
HAVE BEEN PRESENTED BUT I I'M

03:23:15.950 --> 03:23:17.418
NOT.

03:23:17.485 --> 03:23:18.553
IF YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT YEAH I

03:23:18.619 --> 03:23:19.620
THINK I SHOULD TRY AND BY THE

03:23:19.687 --> 03:23:20.955
WAY MY EX WASN'T DIRECTED

03:23:21.022 --> 03:23:23.090
SPECIFICALLY AT ONE PARTICULAR

03:23:23.157 --> 03:23:24.125
ORGANIZATION I'M TALKING ABOUT

03:23:24.191 --> 03:23:24.859
US.

03:23:24.926 --> 03:23:26.561
OF COLLECTIVELY AND AND AND I

03:23:26.627 --> 03:23:28.162
THINK WE HAVE TO COME. TO THIS

03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:29.530
POINT IN TIME WHERE IT'S IT'S

03:23:29.597 --> 03:23:31.065
TIME FOR US TO STEP UP TO BE

03:23:31.132 --> 03:23:32.800
ABLE TO TO GET REALLY TO THE THE

03:23:32.867 --> 03:23:33.935
POINT AND RESOLVE THIS MATTER

03:23:34.001 --> 03:23:35.269
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME COURAGE

03:23:35.336 --> 03:23:37.004
ON OUR SIDE. TO BE ABLE TO STAND

03:23:37.071 --> 03:23:38.406
UP TO SOMEBODY STAKEHOLDER

03:23:38.472 --> 03:23:39.440
GROUPS THAT DON'T HAVE A CHOICE

03:23:39.507 --> 03:23:41.008
IN THE MATTER BUT TO CONTINUE ON

03:23:41.075 --> 03:23:42.710
DOWN -- WITH

03:23:42.777 --> 03:23:44.579
THE POSITIONS THAT THEY HAD IT

03:23:44.645 --> 03:23:45.580
IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME COURAGE

03:23:45.646 --> 03:23:47.281
THRUSTS HER FOR POINT --

03:23:47.348 --> 03:23:49.050
SENATOR JACKSON'S JUST A VERY

03:23:49.116 --> 03:23:50.818
QUICK VERY VERY SAID YESTERDAY

03:23:50.885 --> 03:23:51.986
ARE FINE AND SENATOR DODD WILL I

03:23:52.053 --> 03:23:55.189
HAVE A QUESTION CLOSE IT OUT AND

03:23:55.256 --> 03:23:55.856
GO RIGHT.

03:23:55.923 --> 03:23:56.557
TO THE PUBLIC COMES JUST LIKE TO

03:23:56.624 --> 03:23:57.692
CLARIFY THIS YEAR CLUB HAS

03:23:57.758 --> 03:24:01.262
TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF SB.

03:24:01.329 --> 03:24:01.829
TWELVE SIXTY SO THEY HAVE

03:24:01.896 --> 03:24:04.131
RECOGNIZED THE NEED --

03:24:04.198 --> 03:24:06.267
TO COME TO A DEAL WITH THESE

03:24:06.334 --> 03:24:08.569
ISSUES AND THEY COME TO

03:24:08.636 --> 03:24:09.904
RECOGNIZE.

03:24:09.971 --> 03:24:11.706
THE NEED FOR THIS KIND OF FOR

03:24:11.772 --> 03:24:13.174
TREATMENT THEY MAY BE OPPOSED TO

03:24:13.240 --> 03:24:14.842
A SPECIFIC ISSUE AND I'M STILL

03:24:14.909 --> 03:24:16.243
NOT CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

03:24:16.310 --> 03:24:17.311
WHETHER IT'S A BLANKET

03:24:17.378 --> 03:24:19.280
OPPOSITION OR BASED UPON

03:24:19.347 --> 03:24:21.415
SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW TO MOVE IT

03:24:21.482 --> 03:24:25.119
FORWARD BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT.

03:24:25.186 --> 03:24:26.887
AND I HAVE.

03:24:26.954 --> 03:24:28.589
INTERVIEWED IN TALK TO VIRTUALLY

03:24:28.656 --> 03:24:31.392
ALL OF THEM ARE IN SUPPORT OF

03:24:31.459 --> 03:24:33.461
THAT EFFORT.

03:24:33.527 --> 03:24:35.429
TO TO TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND

03:24:35.496 --> 03:24:37.198
TO RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT A PERFECT

03:24:37.264 --> 03:24:38.633
SOLUTION EVERYBODY'S GOING TO

03:24:38.699 --> 03:24:41.002
HAVE TO GIVE A LITTLE SO I'D

03:24:41.068 --> 03:24:44.805
LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT IF I MAY.

03:24:44.872 --> 03:24:46.941
OKAY I I'VE GOT A QUESTION.

03:24:47.008 --> 03:24:48.643
CENTER AYE I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT

03:24:48.709 --> 03:24:49.777
TODAY SO --

03:24:49.844 --> 03:24:52.146
I HOPE WE GET MORE COOPERATION

03:24:52.213 --> 03:24:54.649
AND A MORE ARTICULATION OF WHAT

03:24:54.715 --> 03:24:56.884
THAT COOPERATION WHAT THOSE

03:24:56.951 --> 03:24:59.286
POTENTIAL PROGRAMS AND SOLUTIONS

03:24:59.353 --> 03:25:01.022
ARE TO THESE PROBLEMS.

03:25:01.088 --> 03:25:02.723
THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT A

03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:03.591
HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD

03:25:03.658 --> 03:25:05.192
AND DYING TREES OUT THERE I

03:25:05.259 --> 03:25:06.827
DON'T CARE HOW DAMN REMOTE THESE

03:25:06.894 --> 03:25:07.662
TREES ARE.

03:25:07.728 --> 03:25:09.263
WHEN WE GET DOWN TO ABOUT THIRTY

03:25:09.330 --> 03:25:10.765
MILLION MAYBE ALL BE --

03:25:10.831 --> 03:25:12.767
PLUS WITH THE THE THOUGHT THAT

03:25:12.833 --> 03:25:14.635
WE CAN'T POSSIBLY GET THE LAST

03:25:14.702 --> 03:25:15.569
THIRTY MILLION.

03:25:15.636 --> 03:25:18.139
BUT THAT TO DO NOTHING ON THIS.

03:25:18.205 --> 03:25:20.341
AND USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF

03:25:20.408 --> 03:25:22.209
WHY WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS IS KIND

03:25:22.276 --> 03:25:23.644
OF MIND BLOWING TO MAY.

03:25:23.711 --> 03:25:24.912
AND THEN FINALLY I LIKE TO SEE

03:25:24.979 --> 03:25:26.380
SOME STUDIES DONE THE CENTRAL

03:25:26.447 --> 03:25:28.315
VALLEY'S AIR QUALITY SIXTY DAYS

03:25:28.382 --> 03:25:30.317
IN A ROW WHAT IS THAT BEEN LIKE

03:25:30.384 --> 03:25:31.585
DOWN THERE AND THE CENTRAL

03:25:31.652 --> 03:25:32.186
VALLEY AND WHAT IS THAT REALLY

03:25:32.253 --> 03:25:33.320
ME.

03:25:33.387 --> 03:25:34.822
WERE I IT'S A RHETORICAL

03:25:34.889 --> 03:25:36.957
QUESTION BUT YOU KNOW THAT THE

IN JUST BECAUSE A GOOD LAUGH

03:26:58.506 --> 03:26:59.273
DOESN'T MEAN WE WOULDN'T HEAR

03:26:59.340 --> 03:27:01.041
YOU THE OTHER DAY BUT I JUST

03:27:01.108 --> 03:27:02.777
BRIEFLY WANT TO HIT --

03:27:02.843 --> 03:27:03.878
THREE KEY POINTS HERE WANTED AND

03:27:03.944 --> 03:27:05.246
WE'RE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:27:05.312 --> 03:27:06.213
RESTORING RESILIENCE THE

03:27:06.280 --> 03:27:08.883
LANDSCAPE IN A PARTICULAR FOREST

03:27:08.949 --> 03:27:10.384
CONTEXT WHERE WE WORK --

03:27:10.451 --> 03:27:12.286
CERTAINLY REDUCING THE DENSELY

03:27:12.353 --> 03:27:12.953
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH PRESCRIBED

03:27:13.020 --> 03:27:14.321
FIRE MECHANICAL THING IS IN THE

03:27:14.388 --> 03:27:15.623
MEDIA THING WE CAN DO IN THE

03:27:15.689 --> 03:27:16.724
SHORT TERM.

03:27:16.791 --> 03:27:17.992
WE ALSO NEED TO GET BACK TO

03:27:18.058 --> 03:27:19.293
THOSE LONG TERM CONDITIONS WHERE

03:27:19.360 --> 03:27:20.728
WE HAVE MORE OF THOSE LARGE FIRE

03:27:20.795 --> 03:27:22.196
RESISTANT TREES ON THE LANDSCAPE

03:27:22.263 --> 03:27:23.964
SO THERE'D BE THREE LONG TERM

03:27:24.031 --> 03:27:25.699
THINKING WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

03:27:25.766 --> 03:27:27.201
I ROLLED INTO MY SECOND POINT IS

03:27:27.268 --> 03:27:29.236
THAT ANY.

03:27:29.303 --> 03:27:30.504
REAL WAY OF ADDRESSING THIS BILL

03:27:30.571 --> 03:27:32.940
REQUIRE ONGOING STABLE FUNDING

03:27:33.007 --> 03:27:34.041
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD

03:27:34.108 --> 03:27:36.744
PROGRAMS WHERE LANDOWNERS AND

03:27:36.811 --> 03:27:38.279
BUSINESSES CAN COME TO THE TABLE

03:27:38.345 --> 03:27:39.847
YOU CAN'T BUILD A WORK FORCE IF

03:27:39.914 --> 03:27:41.448
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT ANY FUNDING

03:27:41.515 --> 03:27:42.049
TO KEEP DOING THIS WORK IN A

03:27:42.116 --> 03:27:43.350
COUPLE OF YEARS.

03:27:43.417 --> 03:27:45.052
SO THAT STABILITY IN FUNDING IS

03:27:45.119 --> 03:27:46.687
EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT AS THE

03:27:46.754 --> 03:27:48.222
AMOUNT OF THE FUNDING.

03:27:48.289 --> 03:27:48.989
AND THE FINAL THOUGHT I WOULD

03:27:49.056 --> 03:27:50.090
LEAVE YOU WITH THIS THERE'S BEEN

03:27:50.157 --> 03:27:51.692
SOME TALK ABOUT TARGETS AND YOU

03:27:51.759 --> 03:27:52.459

PLANS FOR ANY MANAGEMENT BUT

03:28:02.436 --> 03:28:03.470
THERE'S A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE

03:28:03.537 --> 03:28:05.606
BETWEEN THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT

03:28:05.673 --> 03:28:06.740

STATEWIDE IN OUR COUNTIES ARE

03:31:46.427 --> 03:31:47.294
WHERE MOST OF THE FIRES ARE

03:31:47.361 --> 03:31:48.595
BURNING RIGHT NOW.

03:31:48.662 --> 03:31:50.998
AND WE APPRECIATE THIS HEARING

03:31:51.065 --> 03:31:51.765
TODAY IN THE TOPICS THAT HAVE

03:31:51.832 --> 03:31:52.933
BEEN DISCUSSED AYE VEGETATION

03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:54.334
MANAGEMENT IS ONE OF OUR TOP

03:31:54.401 --> 03:31:56.070
PRIORITIES YOU'VE ALL BEEN GIVEN

03:31:56.136 --> 03:31:57.204
A LETTER AND BEEN SENT A LETTER

03:31:57.271 --> 03:31:58.372
FROM US THAT HAS MANY

03:31:58.439 --> 03:31:59.807
RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS TOPIC.

03:31:59.873 --> 03:32:01.108
WE WISH THERE WAS ONE MAGIC

03:32:01.175 --> 03:32:02.276
BULLET THAT WOULD FIX THIS BUT

03:32:02.342 --> 03:32:03.510
WE KNOW THAT IT TAKES THE WHOLE

03:32:03.577 --> 03:32:05.045
SUITE OF ACTIVITIES.

03:32:05.112 --> 03:32:06.680
FROM MECHANICAL THINNING TO

UTILIZATION AND INNOVATIVE WOOD

03:32:09.983 --> 03:32:12.119
PRODUCTS TO ATTACK THIS THING

03:32:12.186 --> 03:32:13.187
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

03:32:13.253 --> 03:32:14.421
FOR A LONG TIME AND WE'D LIKE TO

03:32:14.488 --> 03:32:15.422
SEE SOME GOOD.

03:32:15.489 --> 03:32:17.691
UP A GOOD PLAN OF ACTION COME

03:32:17.758 --> 03:32:21.695
OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU.

03:32:21.762 --> 03:32:23.897
WELL I'M CHAD HANSEN ON MEDIA

03:32:23.964 --> 03:32:25.766
FOREST AND FIRE ECOLOGISTS WITH

03:32:25.833 --> 03:32:26.233
THE JOHN YOUR PROJECT

03:32:26.300 --> 03:32:26.533
[inaudible]

03:32:26.600 --> 03:32:30.037
ON I DO RESEARCH ON THESE ISSUES

03:32:30.104 --> 03:32:32.039
AND A DOZEN KEY IT QUESTIONS

03:32:32.106 --> 03:32:33.674
WERE BROUGHT UP AND I ENCOURAGE

03:32:33.740 --> 03:32:35.209
ANYONE COMMITTEE WANTS TO LEARN

03:32:35.275 --> 03:32:36.743
MORE TO REACH OUT TO ME AND HAVE

03:32:36.810 --> 03:32:37.644
A CONVERSATION BUT TO THE

03:32:37.711 --> 03:32:39.379
QUESTION OF WHETHER OUR FORESTS

03:32:39.446 --> 03:32:40.214
ARE.

03:32:40.280 --> 03:32:42.783
ARE UNNATURALLY DANCE --

03:32:42.850 --> 03:32:44.017
THAT IS A REALLY SERIOUS

03:32:44.084 --> 03:32:45.853
MISCONCEPTION.

03:32:45.919 --> 03:32:47.054
WITH THAT THE SCIENCE TELLS US

03:32:47.121 --> 03:32:48.122
THAT WE HAVE SLIGHTLY MORE SMALL

03:32:48.188 --> 03:32:49.790
TREES.

03:32:49.857 --> 03:32:51.592
OVERALL ON CALIFORNIA SOURCE WE

03:32:51.658 --> 03:32:53.527
HAVE FEWER MEDIUM TO LARGE TREES

03:32:53.594 --> 03:32:55.162
OVERALL WE HAVE LESS BIOMASS ARE

03:32:55.229 --> 03:32:56.330
FORCED NOW THAT WE HAVE

03:32:56.396 --> 03:32:58.198
HISTORICALLY.

03:32:58.265 --> 03:32:58.765
AND A LOT OF THAT'S DUE TO

03:32:58.832 --> 03:32:59.633
DECADES OF LOG.

03:32:59.700 --> 03:33:00.901
THERE'S A KEY STUDY ON THIS BY

03:33:00.968 --> 03:33:03.337
BY MCINTYRE ALL TWO THOUSAND

03:33:03.403 --> 03:33:04.304
FIFTEEN I'VE DONE RESEARCH ON

03:33:04.371 --> 03:33:05.372
THIS IS WELL.

03:33:05.439 --> 03:33:06.740
IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

03:33:06.807 --> 03:33:07.674
UNDERSTAND THAT THE SECOND THING

03:33:07.741 --> 03:33:09.243
IS THAT --

03:33:09.309 --> 03:33:12.679
OVERWHELMINGLY FIREBIRD NOT BY

03:33:12.746 --> 03:33:14.948
FOREST'S DENSITY OR OVERALL --

03:33:15.015 --> 03:33:17.417
THE BIOMASS DENSITY --

03:33:17.484 --> 03:33:19.086
OFTENTIMES WHEN FORCE OR LOG

03:33:19.153 --> 03:33:20.687
THEY TEND TO BURN MORE INTENSELY

03:33:20.754 --> 03:33:22.289
WE DID THE BIGGEST STUDY EVER

03:33:22.356 --> 03:33:24.024
DONE ON THAT CROSSING TIGHTLY

03:33:24.091 --> 03:33:25.159
SEARCHLIGHT STATE THAT'S SIMILAR

03:33:25.225 --> 03:33:26.460
CAN YOU TELL ME I DIDN'T GET.

03:33:26.527 --> 03:33:28.428
YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT

03:33:28.495 --> 03:33:31.165
YES I'M A DOCTOR CHAD HANSEN I'M

03:33:31.231 --> 03:33:33.066
A FOREST IN FIRE ECOLOGIST WITH

03:33:33.133 --> 03:33:35.536
THE JOHN IN YOUR PROJECT THANK

03:33:35.602 --> 03:33:38.172
YOU VERY MUCH NEXT BEAKER.

03:33:38.238 --> 03:33:39.406
GOOD EVENING CHAIR MEMBERS MY

03:33:39.473 --> 03:33:40.841
NAME IS CHRIS BURNS FROM THE

03:33:40.908 --> 03:33:42.309
SIERRA BUSINESS COUNCIL AND WE

03:33:42.376 --> 03:33:44.077
WORKED OUT THIS YEAR NEVADA --

03:33:44.144 --> 03:33:46.046
ON THE ON ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC

03:33:46.113 --> 03:33:47.748
AND SOCIAL ISSUES I'M RUBBING

03:33:47.814 --> 03:33:48.248
THAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS

03:33:48.315 --> 03:33:49.950
COMMITTEE ACHIEVES AT LEAST

03:33:50.017 --> 03:33:50.951
THREE THINGS.

03:33:51.018 --> 03:33:51.718
ARE THE FIRST THAT IT PROTECTS

03:33:51.785 --> 03:33:53.654
RURAL RATEPAYERS FROM BOTH FIRE

03:33:53.720 --> 03:33:55.189
AND INCREASED --

03:33:55.255 --> 03:33:56.757
REST ENERGY RATES --

03:33:56.823 --> 03:33:57.758
THAT IT THAT THIS COMMITTEE

03:33:57.824 --> 03:33:59.159
WORKS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE

03:33:59.226 --> 03:34:00.494
THE PACE AND SCALE OF FOREST

03:34:00.561 --> 03:34:01.828
RESTORATION.

03:34:01.895 --> 03:34:02.696
AND ALSO --

03:34:02.763 --> 03:34:04.298
THIRD AYE CAPITALIZES ON THE

03:34:04.364 --> 03:34:05.899
ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC AND

03:34:05.966 --> 03:34:08.302
SOCIAL BENEFITS OF FUEL THINNING

03:34:08.368 --> 03:34:09.703
IN BETTER FORCE MANAGEMENT.

03:34:09.770 --> 03:34:11.104
HAD THREE THINGS LIKE BIO ENERGY

03:34:11.171 --> 03:34:11.438
INNOVATIVE --

03:34:11.505 --> 03:34:12.973
WOOD PRODUCTS IT'S IMPORTANT TO

03:34:13.040 --> 03:34:14.641
NOTE THAT PART OF THE REASON WHY

03:34:14.708 --> 03:34:16.376
MCGUIRE MATERIALS ARE BEING SENT

03:34:16.443 --> 03:34:17.377
TO BOMB US FACILITIES IN THE

03:34:17.444 --> 03:34:19.046
CENTRAL VALLEY IS BECAUSE MANY

03:34:19.112 --> 03:34:20.480
OF THE RURAL ABOUT MASS

03:34:20.547 --> 03:34:22.015
FACILITIES HAVE GONE OUT OF

03:34:22.082 --> 03:34:22.883
BUSINESS AND ARE UNABLE TO TAKE

03:34:22.950 --> 03:34:23.584
THOSE.

03:34:23.650 --> 03:34:25.352
MATERIALS SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO

03:34:25.419 --> 03:34:26.987
GET THOSE BACK UP AND RUNNING

03:34:27.054 --> 03:34:29.423
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

03:34:29.489 --> 03:34:30.857
I REBEKAH AUGUST FROM THOSE

03:34:30.924 --> 03:34:32.492
PARTIES FORCED WATCH --

03:34:32.559 --> 03:34:33.126
STUDIES SHOW THAT THE MORE WE DO

03:34:33.193 --> 03:34:35.028
TO MAKE REMOTE COMMERCIAL

03:34:35.095 --> 03:34:36.730
PROJECTS.

03:34:36.797 --> 03:34:38.131
WHICH TAKE THE LEAST FLAMMABLE

03:34:38.198 --> 03:34:39.967
MATERIALS FROM THE FOREST OR

03:34:40.033 --> 03:34:41.335
CONVERT NATIVE EDUCATE

03:34:41.401 --> 03:34:42.669
VEGETATION TOMORROW FILE

03:34:42.736 --> 03:34:44.071
MATERIALS THE MORE WE TEND TO

03:34:44.137 --> 03:34:46.006
MAKE FIRES MORE INTENSE OR

03:34:46.073 --> 03:34:47.307
SPREAD MORE QUICK FARMER QUICKLY.

03:34:47.374 --> 03:34:48.809
THESE APPROACHES ONLY MAKE

03:34:48.875 --> 03:34:50.410
PEOPLE FEEL SAFER AND AS SOON AS

03:34:50.477 --> 03:34:51.878
IT'S CLEAR THAT THE HOMES

03:34:51.945 --> 03:34:53.747
CONTINUE TO BURN.

03:34:53.814 --> 03:34:55.782
ON THAT BENEFIT WILL BE GONE.

03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:57.417
THE FACT IS THAT FIRES HERE LIKE

03:34:57.484 --> 03:34:58.885
WE'VE ALL SAID AND SORT OF

03:34:58.952 --> 03:35:00.087
LAYING CONCRETE FROM MEXICO TO

03:35:00.153 --> 03:35:01.188
OREGON WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO

03:35:01.255 --> 03:35:02.756
STOP IT.

03:35:02.823 --> 03:35:04.191
WHAT IS NEEDED IS STRONG SUPPORT

03:35:04.258 --> 03:35:05.525
OF WHAT'S PROVEN TO PROTECT LIFE

03:35:05.592 --> 03:35:06.760
AND PROPERTY LIKE SOME OF WHAT

03:35:06.827 --> 03:35:07.728

BEFORE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION

03:36:02.749 --> 03:36:03.750
TO THIS AND TO THAT END FOR

03:36:03.817 --> 03:36:05.018
SUPPORTING A NUMBER OF BILLS

INCLUDING SENATOR JACKSON'S BILL

03:36:06.753 --> 03:36:08.121
ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD SPILL.

03:36:08.188 --> 03:36:09.556
OUT WHEN IT COMES TO BIOMASS

03:36:09.623 --> 03:36:10.757
WINTER STAND THAT THAT CAN BE A

03:36:10.824 --> 03:36:12.526
BENEFICIAL AND USE FOR SOME OF

03:36:12.592 --> 03:36:13.960
THESE TREES AND VEGETATION

03:36:14.027 --> 03:36:15.696
THAT'S REMOVED.

03:36:15.762 --> 03:36:18.131
FROM OUR FORESTS WE HAVE --

03:36:18.198 --> 03:36:20.334
OPPOSE PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO

03:36:20.400 --> 03:36:22.169
CREATE A MANDATE --

03:36:22.235 --> 03:36:23.603
THAT GENERALLY INCREASE COSTS ON

03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:25.005
OUR REPAIRS SO WE ASK THE A

03:36:25.072 --> 03:36:26.440
COMMITTEE WHEN CONSIDERING THIS

03:36:26.506 --> 03:36:28.108
ISSUE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

03:36:28.175 --> 03:36:29.710
I HEARD MENTIONED AT THE CONCEPT

03:36:29.776 --> 03:36:31.445
OF A SUBSIDY TO LOWER THE COST

03:36:31.511 --> 03:36:31.945
AND I THINK THAT'S AN

03:36:32.012 --> 03:36:33.313
INTERESTING CONCEPT TO EXPLORE

03:36:33.380 --> 03:36:34.448
IF THIS IS.

03:36:34.514 --> 03:36:35.882
AT THE ROAD THAT THAT COMMITTEE

03:36:35.949 --> 03:36:40.387
INTENDS --

FOR OVER TEN YEARS NOW.

03:36:47.027 --> 03:36:48.795
AND ISSUE THAT.

03:36:48.862 --> 03:36:49.696
HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED IN DETAIL

03:36:49.763 --> 03:36:50.263
HERE.

03:36:50.330 --> 03:36:52.666
THAT PERMEATES THIS THOSE.

03:36:52.733 --> 03:36:53.667
WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT FUELS

03:36:53.734 --> 03:36:56.370
TREATMENTS AND THINNING PROJECTS?
