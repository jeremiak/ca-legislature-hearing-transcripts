PERSONNEL CAN ARE CIVIL SIR SYSTEM IS THAT IN THIS ARE THEIR EMPLOYEES FAIRLY. ONE OF THE MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF A PERSONNEL COMMISSION TO HEAR AND THIS. ON THE DISTRICT DISCIPLINARY ACTION IN OTHER WORDS THE COMMISSION ACTS IN EQUITIES ARE JUDICIAL CAPACITY REGARDING THE DISTRICTS ACTIONS. GENERALLY THE COMMISSION RECEIVED THEIR COUNSEL FROM THE SAME LAWYERS THAT WORK FOR THE DISTRICT. HOWEVER WHAT IF IT MISSION WOULD RATHER RECEIVE LEGAL ADVICE FROM OUTSIDE COUNSEL ON SEPARATE MATTERS BECAUSE IT SEES A CONFLICT WITH THE DISTRICT LAWYER'S ADVICE. ON THE CURRENT LAW COMMISSIONERS LACKED THE POWER TO DECIDE WHAT IT THEY MAY RECEIVE COUNSEL FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN THE DISTRICTS LAWYERS. AS A RESULT THE PERSONNEL COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REFUSE COUNSEL FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHEN HE FINDS APPROPRIATE.

TO EXISTING BARGAINING UNITS AND WORKERS ATTEMPTING TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN AT CAMPUSES ACROSS THE STATE. WARNING EMPLOYEES OF SALARY FREEZES AND A LOSS OF THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT WORKING HOURS. THESE ARE FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW. UNFORTUNATELY EVEN IF THE UNION IS SUCCESSFUL IN PETITIONING THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD TO GRANT AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE. AND THERE WERE NO MEANINGFUL CONSEQUENCES TO THE UC. ARBIL WILL IMPOSE A THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY FOR VIOLATION PER EMPLOYEE. BY CREATING A FINANCIAL PENALTY FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF ANTI UNION COMMUNICATIONS YOU SEE WOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY BEFORE INTENTIONALLY DISCOURAGING UNION ACTIVITY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE SPECIALLY HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THEM AS THE EXERCISE ESSENTIAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS SUCH AS DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO BE CALM OR REMAIN A MEMBER OF A UNION. THESE ARE CHOICES THAT SHOULD BE PRETTY AID. WITHOUT COERCION OR ON WHAT SHOULD BE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. WHAT'S THAT LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES.

SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE ARE. MAKING SURE THAT IT ISN'T JUST SAYING YOU CAN'T DO IT SAYING IF YOU DO IT THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES. AND I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THAT A JOB AT THE UC IT'S A GREAT JOB. AND OF MOST EVERYONE WHO IS IN SUPPORT THIS BILL WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. BUT I THINK THAT THERE HAVE TO BE PROTECTIONS FOR THE EMPLOYEES. AND THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO. TO SHARE THEIR GRIEVANCES WITHOUT. REPERCUSSIONS AND I THINK THE UNIVERSITY NEEDS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE ONE THEY DO- WHEN THEY DO NOT ABIDE BY THAT SO THANK YOU. FOR THIS. AND WITH THAT I WOULD- THE COMMOTION OF THE BILL. SECOND OF A MOTION SECOND MOTION BY SOME MEMBER AS SECOND BY. WHICH COOLEY AT ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS COMMENTS. SAYING ON SOME REMEMBERED LIKE CLOSE. A PERFECT EUROPE CONSIDERATION THIS BILL LET ME JUST RESPOND A FEW THINGS THAT ARE FOR FROM THE UC- FIRST OF ALL THEY WONDER WHY IT APPLIES TO THEM AND WHAT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A FUTURE BILL THAT WOULD APPLY TO MORE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS OR OTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THAT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT BUT THE REALITY IS IN RECENT YEARS THE UC HAS BEEN THE MOST EGREGIOUS VIOLATOR. OF IN THIS AREA AND DESPITE WARNINGS AND PROMISES TO DO BETTER THEY'VE CONTINUED TO FLAUNT THE LAW AND AS- ARE ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUE- DOLLARS COMES REYES JUST MENTION- AT THIS MOMENT THERE'S REALLY NO TEETH- EVEN IF THE EMPLOYER ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND PETITION PER TO GRANT AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE PER CAN ONLY ISSUE A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER. BY THE TIME THAT NOTICE THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE AND SO WE THINK THAT THERE MAY BE JUST A LITTLE BIT AS PARTY FROM I ALSO WANT TO JUST REITERATE THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT EASY TO VIOLATE THE LAW ON THE SITUATIONS YOU SEE HAS TO TAKE CONCERTED STEPS TO STAND UP ANTI UNION MEDICATIONS AND- AND THAT'S NOT A TRIVIAL MATTER STAND BLESSING I WANT TO SAY. YOU KNOW AT THIS TIME PERIOD NOW THAN. WORKERS NEED TO SPEAK UP TO VOICE CONCERNS PARTICULARLY AROUND WORKPLACE SAFETY.

THIS MEASURE WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIANS OF RECOVERY EFFORTS THAT WE PLAN TO TAKE- THIS YEAR TO BE MORE MEANINGFUL IS STEPPED AS STEPS TO MINIMIZE INEQUALITY AND PROMOTE ECONOMIC FAIRNSS FALL. IT'S A FIVE SIX TO PREVENT CONTINUED DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR BY ALLOWING GENDER RACE AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY TO BE CONSIDERED. AS ONE OF THE MANY FACTORS IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. A PUBLIC CONTRACTING IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE WHICH IN THAT THE USE OF RACE AND GENDER COMES CONSCIOUS DECISION MAKING IN CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SECTOR. THIS CHANGE BUT CALIFORNIA OUT OF STEP WITH THE NATION BEING ONE OF ONLY EIGHT STATES THAT HAVE HAD THIS BAN ON EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. AND SERVES AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO SOLD LOCAL AND STATE POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISPARITIES EXPERIENCED BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY FIFTEEN STUDY WOMEN OWNED AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES LOSE MORE THAN ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWO OH NINE. CAL WITH CALIFORNIA WENT FROM BEING ONE OF THE TOP PERFORMING STATES IN THE COUNTRY. IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES A WITH OUR CALTRANS THIS- DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE CONTRACTING AND ESSENCE FALLING TO ONE OF THE TWO WORST PERFORMING STATE RELATIVE TO ITS DIVERSITY. PUTTING IT IN THE COMPANY OF STATE AS WELL WITH MUCH LESS DIVERSITY SUCH AS NEBRASKA IN VERMONT. EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION FOR REMAINS FOR SYSTEM ACCORDING TO RECENT RESEARCH 27% OF ASIANS 31% OF NATIVE AMERICANS 33% OF LATINOS AND 56% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE DISCRIMINATION WHEN APPLYING FOR JOBS. WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR ALSO A WITNESS HIGH LEVELS OF DISCRIMINATION WHEN SEEKING PROMOTIONS ARE EQUAL PAY. CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT DATA REVEALS OF WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO BE UNDER REPRESENTED AN UNDERVALUED. ESPECIALLY IN HIGH LEVEL EXECUTIVE POSITIONS THAT COME WITH INCREASED RESPONSIBILITY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION CONTROLLED IN COMPENSATION. AND YET RESEARCH DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MORE REPRESENTATIVE AND REFLECTIVE OUR CIVIL SERVICE AND PUBLIC AGENCY ARE THE MORE RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT ATTENDS TO BE. RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT MINORITY POLICE OFFICER WITH A LESS LIKELY THAN WHITE OFFICERS TO CHARACTERIZE MINORITY CITIZENS AS HOSTILE ARE IN DIFFERENT TO LAW IT FOR WATER. BLACK SOCIAL WORKERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO WITHIN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS ARE PERCEIVED LACK CLIENTS FAVORABLY. IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED THE TEACHER DIVERSITY CAN CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN STUDENTS. SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS BUT ONLY THERE 5% OF. T. ARE TEACHERS OF COLOR. AND WE ARE BARRED FROM RECOUP THEM BECAUSE OF PROP TWO OH NINE. EVEN THOUGH STUDENTS OF COLOR MAKE UP MRE THAN THREE FOURTHS OF OUR STUDENT BODY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS WHEN THE WHEN THE THOUGHT IS TO BASE MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCT OF AN ADEQUATE AND INADEQUACIES THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN THE SOCIETY ARE DRESSED. EVER OVER TWO DECADES ACA WOULD PROVIDE CALIFORNIA VOTERS IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT AND EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ABOUT REMEDIES FOR GENDER BIAS AND THE SEVERITY AND TO REMOVE THE BAN ON EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.

I WANT TO MAKE THREE POINTS. FIRST POSITION TO NINE OF THE NECESSARY. BECAUSE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ALREADY DELIVERY LIMITS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. SECOND PROPOSITION TO AN END OF THE DESIRABLE BECAUSE UNLIKE THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION ELIMINATES AFFIRMATIVE ACTION EVEN WHEN IT'S NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A COMPELLING PURPOSE.

ANY OTHER GROUP CAN APPEAL THE STATE LEGISLATURE BUT CITY COUNCIL BUT COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PREVENTATIVE TREATMENT.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT NEXT BIGGER. AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS IN Q. OKAY WITH THAT SAID WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO COMMITTEE. ANY COMMENTS BY COMMITTEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BUT FIRST WANT TO COMMENT ABOUT HOW I JUST LOVE THE DIVERSE THE OF THE PHONE CALLS FOR AND AGAINST- THIS A CA FIVE. I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA'S DROUGHT BARBER CITY. HAVE EVERYBODY INCLUDED IN EVERYTHING THAT WE DO. THERE WERE A FEW COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE THE THAT I WANTED TO JUST EMPHASIZE ARE WE ONE OF THE LETTERS OF SUPPORT CAME FROM SO MANY OF OUR- ORGANIZATIONS TRUST WORST. ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE ASIAN LONG ALLIANCE WORKING FOR DIGNITY JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. AND THAT SOME OF THOSE THAT I'VE WORKED WITH FOR SO MANY YEARS LIKE PASTOR ST CASEY WITH COPE. AFTER ENTERING YOUR FOR THIS PRESIDENT CEO OF PARK. OUR DOCTOR WHO SECOND THAT ON BUT FROM THE LATINO LATINO ROUNDTABLE THE CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION VINCENT TO PANDA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF SO MANY IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THIS PARTICULAR. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BUT MY FIRST QUESTION IS TO THE AUTHOR I DO WANT TO CONFIRM. THE VOTE FOR THIS. IS NOT OVER TURNING TO NIGHT IT IS ALLOWING THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO VOTE ON IT IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT THIS IS TO PUT IT ON THE BALLOT SO THAT THE VOTERS CAN DECIDE WHETHER WE WANT TO CONTINUE DOWN THE SAME PATH OR GO BACK AND DO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST WITH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. THANK YOU. IN THE LETTER FROM THE THIS ORGANIZATION THERE ARE A FEW QUOTES THAT IF I MAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN. THEY SAY OVER TURNING AND I QUOTE OVERTURNING CALIFORNIA'S BAN ON PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. IS LONG OVERDUE. THE GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC HARM OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC ONLY HEIGHTENS THE IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING FAIRNESS FOR PUBLIC CONTRACTING AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES. LATER IN THE LETTER THEY SAY WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO DENY CALIFORNIANS. AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED SIMPLY BECAUSE OF HOW THEY LOOK OR WHO THEY ARE. THIS PARTICULAR- ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND ALLOW ALL CALIFORNIANS TO FIND A GOOD JOB- TO JUST DECENT WAGE AND GET AHEAD IN LIFE AND IN THEIR CAREERS. YOU CAN'T HAVE SHARED SUCCESS WITHOUT SHARED OPPORTUNITY LET'S PUT CALIFORNIA ON A PATH TOWARD EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. WITHOUT A DOUBT WHEN WE HAVE DIVERSE CITY THAT IS WHEN WE OF CALIFORNIANS WILL BENEFIT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE ADVERSITY WE ALL LOSE WE ALL LOSE. I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE AND I'M SURE MANY OF US WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA'S COLORBLIND. BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE. AND THE IT WAS. IF WE DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO BEGIN WITH THE LET LEVEL A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WE'RE NEVER GOING TO SUCCEED AT INCREASING THE DIVERSITY THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED THIS DIVERSE CITY IS GOING TO MAKE WHAT WILL BE MORE REFLECTIVE OF WHAT THE STATE REALLY LOOKS LIKE. AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED HERE IN THIS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME IS THAT IS JUST SO MANY OTHERS. I DO WANT TO. END WITH A QUOTE FROM A GREAT FRIEND. WHO HAPPENS TO BE THE AUTHOR OF THIS. CALIFORNIANS HAVE BUILT THE FIFTH THE LARGEST AND STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD BUT TOO MANY HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS AND NOT SHARING IN OUR STATES PROSPERITY PARTICULARLY WOMEN. FAMILIES OF COLOR AND LOW WAGE WORKERS THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO CORRECT THE HARM THAT WAS DONE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE THE RIGHT. TO DETERMINE WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH PROP TWENTY NINE AND WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. OKAY THANK YOU I THINK THAT ALSO SUMMER VOEPEL AND THEN SUMMER COOPER WITH COMMON GUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR AND WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. EDUCATING EACH OTHER. BUT I THINK I WAS EDUCATED MORE SO I WOULD LIKE TO STATE MY POSITION HERE. AND MY LOGICAL REASONS. FIRST OF ALL I HAVE ANALYZE THIS IN MY OWN MIND ON A POLITICAL LEVEL A MORAL LEVEL IN AND ECONOMIC LEVEL. AND IT OCCURRED TO ME IT THIS PROP TWO OH NINE WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX CORRECT OKAY. IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT'S ONE BIT BUT GOAL GENERATION AGO. ONE WHOLE GENERATION IT WAS A DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA THAT WITH A DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC MIX NOW WHAT WHOA OKAY. GOT THAT ONE. NOW WE'VE GOT CODED NINETEEN AND BASICALLY OUR ECONOMIC BUSES BROKEN DOWN AND EVERYBODY GOT OFF THE BUS NOW WHEN WE GET GOING AGAIN WHO'S GOING TO GET ON THE BUS. AND I'M THINKING. MY BASS AND YOU'VE HEARD MANY OF MY BASE ON THE PHONE CALLS. I I'M NOT HERE ON MY OWN I'M REPRESENTING MY DISTRICT. BUT I'M GOING TO VOTE YES FOR THIS TO LEAVE COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE NEXT STEP IS THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE OUGHT AND WILL DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. THAT WILL GIVE ME TIME TO REACH OUT TO MY FAITH GROUPS. ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS EVERYBODY WHERE YOU GUYS AT. AND WE'LL HAVE WITHIN MY DISTRICT A GOOD DEBATE. AND THEN I WILL MAKE UP MY MIND OF HOW TO REPRESENT MY DISTRICT ON THE FLOOR. SO IT BOILS DOWN TO ME. THIS IS. GOTTA GO BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS GENERATION. THAT'S IT THAT'S ALL I GOT THANK YOU SOME RECOUP YOU KNOW WE VOTE ON A LOT OF THINGS IN LEGISLATURE AND IT'S NOT THAT OFTEN YOU TO SEND SOMETHING BACK TO THE VOTERS HAVE THE VOTERS VOTE FOR IT THAT'S THAT'S THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS THEY PUT US HERE AND HAVE A VOTERS IN PART OF IT MAYBE THE CITY IN GOOD OR BAD OR INDIFFERENT. IT HAPPENS- I'VE QUESTION FOR DR WEBBER- WE A LOT OF FOLKS THAT COMMUNITY CALL AND WHOSE BENEFIT ME IF I COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF AND IT'S HARD TO TALK THIS THING OUT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF. PROP TWO OH NINE THERE WAS A LOT OF MISINFORMATION PUT OUT ABOUT HOW IS GOING TO HURT THE ASIAN COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF ENROLLMENT IN UNIVERSITIES. AND ALL OF THE DATA THE MATURE WE GAVE YOU SHOW THAT IT DID NOT. IN FACT AGENTS DID BETTER UNDER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THAN THEY DID- WITH UNDER UNDER PROP TWO OH NINE. OF THE PROP TWO NINE WAS SOLD AS SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING TO DEAL WITH THE IT AND PEOPLE THOUGHT THE UNIVERSITY. AND WHAT IT DID WAS A DECIMATED REALLY UP LIKE BUSINESSES WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES AND CONTRACTING IN THE STATE. WE SAW CONTRACTING IN SAN DIEGO GO FROM 40% THE WOMEN MINORITIES DOWN TO ONE AND TWO PERCENT. AS IT IS TODAY. AND SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS WE WERE SOLD A BILL OF GOODS ABOUT IT THE UNIVERSITY'S DECIDED THEMSELVES AND THEY HAVE WORKED VERY HARD TO WITH. THAT FOR YEARS THE DIVERSITY IS THE NEXT IT'S NECESSARY FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THEY HAVE DEVISED. WAYS TO TRY TO GET A DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION. WE STILL LAG BEHIND IN SOME AREAS IN TERMS OF THE POPULATION. BUT THEY WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THEY TRY TO GET FOLKS IN BUT ASIANS ARE NOT. FED NOT BENEFITING FROM PROP TWO OH NINE. THEN I BENEFITING IN TERMS OF BUSINESSES AND CONTRACTING. NOT NOT NOT BENEFITING IN TERMS OF SCHOOL IN MOBILE. AND SO- AS A RESULT WHEN WE HAD AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND THAT'S AN EFFORT TO BE. SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT AT LEAST OF AFFIRMATIVE EFFORT TO INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS IS NOT A QUOTA. IT'S NOT A GUARANTEED. UP AND AS A RESULT OF THOSE STATE STANDARDS THERE WERE GREATER IN MOMENTS OF ASIANS LATINOS. AND AFRICAN AMERICANS. VERSUS WHAT WAS AS WELL AS THE REGULAR STUDENTS THE OF THE OTHER. THAT WOULD THERE. SO THEY STILL THERE'S- A CONCEPT THE THIS IS TO HAPPEN AT. OF AND YET WHEN YOU DEAL WITH THE- THE AGENTS FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND A HOST OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO DRILL DOWN TO THE DATA. MATERIAL WE'VE GIVEN THEM. IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY THAT THERE IS NO NEGATIVE THAT COMES TO ASIAN POPULATIONS. AS A RESULT OF IT. AFRICAN AMERICANS FIGHT HARD FOR THIS PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITY WITH BERMAN OF ACTION. AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WE ARE THE LEAST TO PERMANENT BENEFIT FROM IT. IN TERMS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND THE INFORMATION. YET WE FIGHT FOR IT. BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. MOST OF YOU GOT THE BOSTON GLOBE ARTICLE CONCERNING. COLVIN WE'RE TALKING BACK PULL BUT NOW. THE GROUPS THAT ARE GOING TO BE DEVASTATED BY COLE WAS AT BUT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN. AT THE IMPACT OF IT IN TERMS OF HEALTH. ECONOMICS ALL OF THOSE THINGS IT EDUCATION. OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE WHO ARE STILL SUFFERING WILL HAVE WITH GREAT OF LOSS AS A RESULT OF WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON. IN FEW RESOURCES TO REBUILD. OUR BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE DECIMATED BECAUSE I PEOPLE OF THE LAST ONE TO GET LOANS AT. BANKS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO STABILIZE OUR BUSINESSES. AND WITHOUT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS BUT BUSINESS YOU IT'S DIFFICULT TO STABILIZE A BUSINESS. SO WHEN YOU BEGIN TO LOOK AT IT AND SOME SAY WHAT WE SHOULD DO THIS BECAUSE OF COLD BUT- WE ARE GOING TO SUFFER THE MOST IS THE RESULT OF IT AND WITHOUT SOME AFFIRMATIVE EFFORT WHICH THE BOSTON GLOBE. TALKED ABOUT. IT THESE BUSINESS WILL BUSINESSES WILL NOT COME BACK. AND THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT IN BOSTON THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING SOME AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. IT'S A SPECIAL CONTRACTS THE BUSINESSES AND OTHERS. CALIFORNIA UNDER PROP TWO OH NINE CANNOT DO THAT. AND SO WE WILL SEE IN CALIFORNIA EVEN GREATER. DECIMATION OF BUSINESSES. AND OPPORTUNITIES. AS WE NOT STOP. AT THE- BUSINESSES AND LET YOU KNOW BUSINESS. FOR THEM. GET THE FEWEST NUMBER THE AB OF CONTRACTS. THIS IS AN AND LOANS THAT WE CAN THEN DEPOSIT. AND THE WITH WOMEN. AND MINORITY. TO A BASICALLY STABILIZER. BUSINESSES IF THIS. SO THEN WE HAVE THE OF YOU TO BE. TO DO THAT. EVER BILLS LAST I THREE OR FOUR YEARS. THIS IF YOU'RE A- YOU MAKE LESS THAN A DOES YEAH SO I HAVE DOT. AND EVEN THE IF YOU'RE A MIL CHIEF OF STAFF IN THE STATE CAPITAL YOU TYPICALLY MAKE MORE THAN A FEMALE CHIEF OF STAFF IT TRICKLE DOWN TO OTHER JOBS. AND PAY EQUITY SO HERE WE ARE PRESENT DAY IN THE CITY ASSEMBLYMAN TRY TO CHANGE THAT THE WOMEN ARE EQUAL TO MEN. WE'RE STILL FIGHTING THAT BATTLE WITH INTERESTING KELLY CHART TOLD ME TO MAKE IT EQUAL IT WOULD TAKE TEN YEARS. TO BRING UP THAT PAY SCALE I SAID B. S. YEAH SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT GOES TO THE VOTE OF THE VOTERS. THE LATEST THAT ABSOLUTE THAT'S THE PART THAT'S TROUBLING WITH PEOPLE IT'S- IT'S JUST VERY CAUSTIC ON BOTH SIDES. CHOICE TO VOTE. AND LET YOUR CHOICE BE HEARD THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT THAT. SO I'M I'M GONNA SECOND MISS REYES MOTION. I THANK YOU- SOME MEMBER COOLEY HAS COME. YEAH I JUST WANT TO SPEAK TO THIS I WANT TO START BY SAYING I WANT TO THANK. I DO THINK THE AUTHOR HERE I THINK ALL MY COLLEAGUES REACHED OUT TO ME. I WANT TO PARTICULARLY THANK MY COLLEAGUE IS NOT OF THE ROOM REGGIE JONES SAWYER. WHO OVER SPENDING YEARS REGGIE JONES SAWYER HAS HAD EXCELLENT SELECT COMMITTEES. FOCUSED UPON DISADVANTAGED YOUTH AND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES. REGGIE HAS ALWAYS INCLUDED ME THOSE ARE SELECT COMMITTEES AND I MADE A POINT IF I'M THERE I'M THERE I'M THERE FOR THE HEARING I LISTENED WITNESSES- REGGIE JONES SAWYER CALLED ME ON THIS ISSUE. THE MOST RECENT WERE TOGETHER ON THE- ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON END IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AND I ACTUALLY HAVE. THE FOLIO. THAT I GOT FROM REGGIE JONES SAWYER. AT THAT HEARING. SO I'LL JUST SAY REGGIE JONES SAWYER HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF REACHING OUT TO ME OVER YEARS. TO KIND OF BRING ME ALONG. AND SO I WANT TO GIVE REGGIE A SHOUT OUT. I APPRECIATE HIS AVERAGE SO MANY REACH OUT TO ME. AND SO I WILL BE AN AYE TODAY BUT I FOR ONE SPEAK TO SHARE WHY I'M AN LA. I'VE I'VE KIND OF GONE THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF AN EVOLUTION ON THIS. AND I HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE OF. HOLDEN. AND I TOLD CHRIS. YOU KNOW CHRIS I WAS HERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN WE WERE DEBATING. PROPOSITION THIRTEEN BUT BECAUSE PROP THIRTEEN. AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVIDE TAX RELIEF TO CALIFORNIANS AND WHAT I SAW REPEATEDLY IN THE ASSEMBLY BACK IN THOSE DAYS I MENTION THIS BECAUSE HIS DAD THEY TOLD WAS IN THE SENATE AND THAT ERROR HE WAS A PARTICIPANT IN THIS DEBATE. WASN'T THERE A SORT OF A DIVIDE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND- AND SOME WANTED TO GIVE TAX RELIEF IN A PRO RATTLE HUESO EQUAL ALL. SOMEONE OR SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE TARGETED. THEY ENDED UP PASSES AT THE MORE TARGET ENDED UP NOT WORKING OUT THE VOTERS REJECTED IT. AND IT IS STUCK WITH ME THAT WE DEFINITIONS TO SHE DID ACT IN A WAY ON BEHALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. BUT THAT WAS A DIFFERENT ISSUE A DIFFERENT TIME- I DO THINK RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN A TIME OF GREAT ECONOMIC TURMOIL. THIRTY THREE MILLION AMERICANS OUT OF WORK. WE NEED TO HAVE A PLAN TO START RESPONDED TO THAT ALL OF US COME FROM THE STATE'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CITIES ARE CITIES HAVE LOST TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE. IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS. THIS IS GONNA AFFECT QUALITY OF LIFE IN OUR HOMES. I THINK WE IN THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE THIS YEAR IS DONE. NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE FACT THAT IT'S LIKE CANCER TREATMENT. TRONG MEDICINE WHICH DEALS WITH CANCER CAN SOMETIMES HAVE OTHER EFFECTS THAT NEED REMEDIATION. SO I SORT OF FEEL THIS TIME OF DOWNTURN. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS LOOK ACROSS A BROAD ECONOMY IS A ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO. TO STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE. BUT WE HAVE TIME TO DO THAT I THINK WAS TRYING TO GET A FOCUS ON THAT- MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD CIRCULATED A LETTER ON CITIES JUST RECENTLY I HAVE AN OP ED BEFORE THE BE ALREADY FROM LAST WEEK. THIS TOPIC. I DO THINK WE ANALYSTS TO JUDY TO FOCUS ON WHAT DO WE DO FOR THE ENTIRETY OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THIS MEASURE FOLKS ARE VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM OF HOW DO WE GIVE HOPE. TO FOLKS WHO HAVEN'T HAD. THE AND OF MY COLLEAGUE- MISTER VOEPEL THE VICE CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE YOU YOU MENTIONED SORT OF THE FAITH GROUPS SO I'VE GOT TO TWO IDEAS A TOSSED OUT THROUGH FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS ONE IS OUT OF THE BOOK OF GALATIANS CHAPTER SIX VERSE TO SIX AND NINE SAYS DO NOT GROW WEARY IN WELL DOING. THEREFORE AS WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY LET US DO GOOD TO ALL PEOPLE. I SORT OF THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY AN ETHIC THAT WE OUGHT TO BE AS LAWMAKERS FOLKS AT HOW DO WE DO GOOD FOR ALL PEOPLE. LET'S NOT GROW WEARY IN WELL DOING. ANY OTHER ONE THAT CAME TO MIND ACTUALLY REFLECTED UPON THIS. IS THE FUNNY LITTLE BOOK AN ILL TEST OF THE BOOK OF JONAH. JOHN WHO SENT ON A MISSION TO GO TELL SOME PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE JUDGED. HE DOESN'T EVENTUALLY AFTER A LOT OF. ADVENTURE MARITIME ADVENTURE I SAY AS I LOOK AND- THERE'S NO VOEPEL OVER THERE. BUT AT THE VERY END HE CERTAIN OUTSIDE THE CITY. AND HE'S UNHAPPY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT GENERALLY COMPASSION. AND A PLANT GROWS UP. SHELTERS HIM FROM THE HEAT THEN THE PLANT DIES WHAT YOU REALLY SEE IS THIS BOOK IS ABOUT HOW DO YOU GROW COMPASSION. AND THE PUNCH LINE OF THE BOOK OF JONAH SOMETIMES WE ARE MORE COMPASSIONATE. WE'VE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE SOME HARDSHIP OURSELVES. JOHN IS ALL ABOUT HOW JOHN HAD AN ATTITUDE CHANGE HAVING HAD A GOOD THING THE KIND OF DRIFTED AWAY. SO I DEFINITELY FEEL THIS IS ALL ABOUT TAKING THIS. QUARTER CENTURY ISSUE SENATE BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS IN A TIME WHEN ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING GREAT TRAVAIL. SO ON A DIFFERENT TYPE AWAY NOT A THEORETICAL WAY THEY SORT OF UNDERSTAND WHAT. WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN HOPE SEEMS LOST. WHEN TURMOIL SEEMS LOOMING AND YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO. AND I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT ON US TO PRESENT THIS TO THEM IS THAT QUESTION. TOO CHALLENGING TO FIND COMPASSION THEIR HEARTS BUT ALSO FOR US IS LAWMAKERS TO AND NOW ONLY DURING THE FALL DASH OURSELVES WHAT DO WE DO FOR ALL OTHER CALIFORNIANS. SO THAT WE ARE MAKING. PROGRESS HELPING THE CITIES TO DELIVER QUALITY OF LIFE. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU KNOW PEOPLE FLORA JOBS WHO LOST HER HEALTH CARE IN A TIME OF COVERT. CAN WE HELP THEM WITH PRE PAYS ON THEIR COBRA COVERAGE. THERE'S JUST A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO TO TOUCH OPEN NEXT FEW MONTHS ACTUALLY FEEL IF WE BELIEVE IN THIS ISSUE. AFTER CHORUS ENTRIES RIGHT WE NEED TO JUMP ON OPPORTUNITIES TO DO GOOD TO ALL.

THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO VOEPEL. JUST THE JUST A QUICK COMMENT I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT MR NOR WOULD- SAID ON BEHALF OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT HERE OTHER THAN- OF GOVERNMENT. ORGANIZATION COMPETING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN BASICALLY SUPPLEMENTAL NOT BASIC. PENSIONS BUT SUPPLEMENTAL AYE ARRAYS AND ALSO I REMIND EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT DUE TO THE COVE IT NINETEEN. WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE ECONOMIC SHUT DOWN AND TRY TO RESTART WHICH IS GONNA BE A HAT TRICK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. BUT HERE EARLY. IT'S VERY STRANGE TO ME IF YOU CAN DANCE THE TIME LINE DOWN WE ARE ACTING IN OUR INVESTMENT AREAS VERY MUCH LIKE THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF NINETEEN TWENTY NINE. WE ENDED UP WITH THE INITIAL CRASH WHICH WE'VE JUST COMPLETED AND THEN A PARTIAL OF KINDA LIKE A FAKE RECOVERY I HATE TO USE THE WORD FAKE HERE TRUST ME. AND THEN. IT RATCHETED DOWN IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN AIRCRAFT THAT HAS ENGINE FAILURE. THE INVESTMENTS THE STOCK MARKET DERIVATIVES ALL OF IT. AB T. EVERYTHING IS DOWNWARD AND THEN YOU HAVE LIKE THE PILOTS TRYING TO PULL UP AND YOU GO DOWN A DID. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS CAPITALIST SUCKED IN AIR AND WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS. IS STIRS EMPERORS HAVE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THEIR FUNDIE. AND AS THE TAX BASE EVAPORATES. THAT MEANS THE CITIES AND ALL THE PARTICIPANTS OF HERS. ARE YOU GOING TO BE IN DEEP TROUBLE. ASSEMBLY FINANCING THE WHOLE YSTEM WITHOUT A STOCK MARKET CRASH INTO ECONOMIC CONTRACTION MISTER CHAIR. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IT'S NOW IT'S OUTSIDE THE PENSIONS THIS BILL SPEAKS TO EFFORTS OUTSIDE THE PENSION SYSTEM I THINK THIS ANSWER STANDARDS GOING EVERY AS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE JUST ONE ORDER I THINK HE'S SPEAKING TO SOMETHING THAT'S NOT REALLY. IT DOESN'T COMPORT WITH A BILL. GREGORY JUST STICK TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL QUESTION WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS IS. FROM STIRS VIEWPOINT. THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE TIMING FOR THIS BILL I WOULD NOT BE NECESSARILY AGAINST IT. IN A COUPLE YEARS WHEN WE SEE WHAT THE ECONOMY'S GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE AND WHAT ARE FUNDING IS GOING TO BE BUT STARS HAS PROBLEMS WITH THEIR PORTFOLIO ANYWAY. ADDING ON AN IRATE MAKES NO ECONOMIC SENSE TO ME RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE ALSO. COMPETING ONCE AGAIN WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT'S MY POINT. THANK ANY OTHER CUSTOMER IF I COULD RESPOND OF THAT CHURCH REAL QUICK NORTH OKAY WHAT EXACTLY THE POINT OF EDUCATION IS VOEPEL BUT I THINK WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ACTUALLY CONTEMPLATES. THAT THE PENSION SYSTEM CAN'T MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL OF ALL ITS MEMBERS BECAUSE- YOU'LL GET YOURS ACTUALLY THE PENSION TEACHERS GET IS. ACTUALLY NOT A LOT WHEN COMPARED TO SOME OTHER PENSION SYSTEMS OUT THERE- SO WHAT WE'RE ENCOURAGING TEACHERS TO DO IS PUT MONEY ASIDE. AND RECOGNIZE THE FACT. THAT WHETHER PENSION SYSTEM HELL THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED MORE MONEY THAN THE PENSION SYSTEM IS OBLIGATED TO GIVE THEM. TO SURVIVE GOING FORWARD. SO AS A LONGTIME TEACHER MYSELF NO I STARTED EARLY ON. YOU KNOW SAVING OUTSIDE MY PENSION SYSTEM BECAUSE I RECOGNIZED THAT THAT PENSION SYSTEM WASN'T. CARRY ME THROUGH AND I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT GEE I'M NOT GONNA GET SOCIAL SECURITY AND I'VE WORKED. MANY YEARS AND YET WON'T GET THE BENEFITS OF SECURITIES ALL THE MONEY THAT I. PUT INTO STILL SECURITY I GAVE AWAY BUT I THINK. THE GOAL HERE IS TO GET TEACHERS TO SAVE MONEY SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD GOAL. NOW SOME OF THE CONCERNS- WORD. THERE IS SHOULD SHOULD THE ON THE IRA IRA BUSINESS WE CAN WE CAN HAVE THAT DEBATE ALL DAY LONG. BUT THERE WAS A CONCERN BROUGHT ABOUT CONFUSION WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED GOING FORWARD. BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TEACHERS THINKING THAT THEY SHOULD DO IS JUST GOING TO I'M GOING TO GO. OPEN IRATE WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT BE AWARE THAT THEY SHOULD PROBABLY. GO THE FOUR THREE B. ROUTE FIRST BECAUSE THAT CAPITA MUCH HIGHER THAN THE IRA CAP. RIGHT AND ALSO SOME OF THE OFFERINGS THAT WE IF TO STARS AS GOING TO GOING TO THE SERENE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE- AT THOSE PRODUCTS THEY DO OFFER OUR COMPETITIVE. WHEN I FIRST WENT INTO TEACHING BASICALLY ALL YOU CAN GET WAS AN ANNUITY. RIGHT AND THAT PROBABLY AT THE AGE MY WAS THAT PROBABLY WASN'T THE BEST VEHICLE INVESTMENT VEHICLE FOR ME AT THAT POINT IN MY LIFE IT MAY BE IN A GOOD INVESTMENT VEHICLE FOR PEOPLE ANOTHER DIFFERENT POINTS TO LIVE THERE ARE DIFFERENT AND IT WAS NOW MORE SO THAN WHAT THAN THEIR THEIR WORK BACK IN BUT AGAIN I'D SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CONTEMPLATED AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS- SUMMARY AS HAPPENED. THANK YOU I THINK I WAS NOT A TEACHER FOR MY HUSBAND WAS AND- YES TERRACE- RETIREMENT- PENSION THAT HE RECEIVED I THINK IS WONDERFUL BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH YOU'RE RIGHT SAVING ON THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHICH HE DID AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT BUT MY POINT IS IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO THAT AS WE TRANSITION SHOULD THIS BILL MAKE ITS WAY OUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT. OUR TEACHERS WITH THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY I GIVEN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO THAT THEY MAKE THE WISEST DECISIONS POSSIBLE AND WHATEVER CAN BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS SOMEHOW INCLUDED IN HERE SO THAT THEY DO GET WISE COUNSEL. BECAUSE THIS HARD EARNED MONEY IS GOING TO HAVE TO SUSTAIN THEM AS YOU SAY BECAUSE THERE IS NO SOCIAL SECURITY. LISTEN I AGREE THE TEACHERS TO BE EDUCATED AS TO THE DIFFERENCE BASS THE BASIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FOUR THREE B. AN IRA RIGHT THEY SHOULD REALLY. YOU KNOW THE A PARTICIPATING FOR THREE BE BEFORE THEY CONTEMPLATE AN IRA- SO I I'M OPEN TO EDUCATION TUBERCULOUS I SAID TO MYSELF TO THE YOUNGER TEACHERS LIKE WALKING THROUGH ITS A HERE'S HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THIS SO YEAH I NEED TO OPEN OUR AND ON A NOTE FOUR THREE B. HERE'S WHAT YOU DO WITH THAT THAT THAT THAT YOU CAN GET IT WITHDRAWN FOR YOUR PAY ROMA ON A MONTHLY BASIS. SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE EDUCATION I'M SUPPORTIVE OF JUST SHOPS IT'S A TOUGH THING WHEN I TAUGHT HIGH SCHOOL FOR YEARS RIGHT IRIS MUTUAL FUND ALL THOSE STOCKS ALL THOSE TYPES OF THINGS I HOPE IT CARRIES THROUGH THOSE KIDS MINDS TODAY I HOPE THEY REMEMBER IT FROM HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE THE FINANCIAL EDUCATION IS A TOUGH THING TO TEACH BECAUSE YOU GOT TO GET PEOPLE THAT RIGHT MOMENT. THAT RIGHT MOMENT- BUT I FULLY SUPPORT YOUR COMMENTS IN THE SUMMER COOPER YOUR QUESTION THAT RIGHT WHAT MOMENT WHEN THEIR FIRST HIRED ORIENTATION SO IMPORTANT RIVER REPRESENTS ALL FOLKS COME IN AND REALLY TALK ABOUT THE NUANCES AND WHAT THE BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS ARE AND WE'LL SEE THAT ENOUGH UNLESS ORGANIZATIONS DAY ONE WHEN THEY SIGNED UP FOR THEIR BENEFITS AND SIDE OF THOSE THINGS TO DO THAT SO THAT'S REALLY. PROCESS TO MAKE SURE CAP WITH THEM. WITH THAT SAID IN OTHER COME. SAY NONE LIKE TO CLOSE AS ARRIVAL. THANK ARE MERGING WITH THAT SAID I THIS A GOOD BILL OUT IT JUST GIVE THEM ANOTHER OPTION MORE FOR THESE FOLKS AS A FOR RETIREMENTS SO I DO RECOMMEND AYE VOTE AND WITH THAT- MISTER SECRETARY LIKE CALDERON.
