00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:34.346
YOU'RE TAKEN AGREE MORE WITH

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:35.147
THE AUTHOR AND SOME OF YOUR

00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:35.947
WITNESSES AND THAT THIS PROJECT

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:37.215
IS CRITICAL AND IT'S VERY

00:23:37.282 --> 00:23:39.551
IMPORTANT BUT AT THE SAME TIME.

00:23:39.618 --> 00:23:42.220
IN SAN DIEGO IN TWO THOUSAND

00:23:42.287 --> 00:23:43.188
TWELVE THE CITY PASSED AN

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:45.590
ORDINANCE OF LED BY THE VOTERS.

00:23:45.657 --> 00:23:47.692
THAT MADE IT SO THAT THERE WAS

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:50.529
A PROHIBITION ON MANDATORY.

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:53.565
PROJECT LABOR. NO PROHIBITION

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:55.467
ON VOLUNTARY DEAL IS BUT A

00:23:55.534 --> 00:23:57.769
PROHIBITION ON MANDATORY FIELD.

00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:58.804
THE INITIATIVE ALSO SAID THAT

00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:59.638
THERE COULD BE ANY

00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:01.506
DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN UNION

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:03.842
AND NONUNION CONTRACTORS SO

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:06.211
LONG AS THEIR WORKFORCE WAS

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:07.846
SEALED IN TRAINED AND DEALT

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:11.650
WITH CERTIFICATED PROGRAMS SUCH

00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:12.250
AS- THE ONE THAT AGENCIES SAN

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:15.153
DIEGO FOR. WOULD YOU HAVE FOR

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.655
YOU HERE IS A MEASURE THAT

00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:18.156
CONDITIONS STATE MONEY. TO THE

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:19.691
CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR THIS ONE

00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:22.828
PROJECT BASED ON THE NEED OR IN

00:24:22.894 --> 00:24:24.963
THIS CASE BASED ON THE FACT

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.932
THAT SAN DIEGO MUST PASS APPEAL

00:24:26.998 --> 00:24:29.334
LAY GRADING A COLLISION COURSE

00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:31.069
HERE WITH MEASURE RIGHT. UP

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:33.205
UNTIL NOW THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO

00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:35.240
WAS ABLE TO PROCURE PUT OUT

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:37.809
THIS AND THERE WAS NO ISSUE BUT

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:39.077
THIS PROJECT YOUR VIOLATE.

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:41.513
MEASURE RIGHT THE AUTHOR IN

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.181
THIS IS IN THIS MEASURE IS

00:24:43.248 --> 00:24:44.683
ATTEMPTING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:47.953
AND I UNDERSTAND WHY. A WAY BY

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:50.956
WHICH TO RENDER MEASURE NAY

00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:53.725
INVALID THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:58.263
THAT MEASURE HEY HOW'S. THAT

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:02.534
PIECE THAT DEALS WITH THE.

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:03.101
DISCRIMINATION PEACE BETWEEN

00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:04.236
UNION AND NONUNION. SO IF YOU

00:25:04.302 --> 00:25:06.571
MANDATE APL LAID OUT THERE YOU

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:07.772
RUN INTO CONFLICT WITH MEASURE

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:09.774
RACE SO WE DON'T BELIEVE. THAT

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:11.409
THIS MEASURE UNFORTUNATELY WILL

00:25:11.476 --> 00:25:12.510
EXPEDITE THE PROCESS THE

00:25:12.577 --> 00:25:14.312
PROCESS OR WE YOU SHOULD BE

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:15.814
UNDER ANY ILLUSION THAT WILL

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:18.016
EITHER. YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:19.951
ISSUES IN ADDITION TO MEASURE

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:21.553
RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT TO THE HEART

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.822
OF THIS NATURE THAT CHARTER

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:25.390
CITIES ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:27.592
THEIR HOME RULE WHEN IT COMES

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:28.760
TO PREPARING PROJECTS.

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:30.395
FURTHERMORE YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE

00:25:30.462 --> 00:25:32.597
GOT UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:34.065
PRECEDENT WHEN IT RELATES TO

00:25:34.132 --> 00:25:37.235
MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS. OWNERS SUCH

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:38.403
AS THE CITY SAN DIEGO CAN

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:39.871
REGULATE HOW YOU BROKE YOUR

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:42.073
PROJECTS BUT REGULATORS AND

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.875
FUNDERS SUCH AS A STATE IN THIS

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:46.278
CASE DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY SO

00:25:46.344 --> 00:25:47.479
THE DISTINCTION I THINK IS ONE

00:25:47.545 --> 00:25:49.114
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.815
NOTWITHSTANDING THAT FACT WERE

00:25:50.882 --> 00:25:52.183
UNDER NO ILLUSION THAT THIS

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.952
MEASURE HAS TREMENDOUS SUPPORT

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:55.320
AND POLITICAL FORCE BEHIND IT

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:57.055
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S OR

00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:58.556
EXHORTATION THAT THIS WILL

00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:00.258
CONTINUE THE LITIGATION AND
