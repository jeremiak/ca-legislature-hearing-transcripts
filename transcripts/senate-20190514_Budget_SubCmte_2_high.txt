VERSUS I WAIT TAKE ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND ASK CAL EPA TO PLEASE COME FORWARD -- UNDER DISCUSSION ONLY WILL HOLD OFF ON THE VOTE ONLY THIS IS PART BE UNDER DISCUSSION ONLY AND THE MAGIC NUMBER. IS. ISSUE. TWENTY THREE MR SECRETARY GOOD AFTERNOON SORRY FOR THE DELAY. PLEASE PROCEED RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M AND THANK YOU MEMBERS IN CHAD I'M I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION REFLECTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING OUR MOST PRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES WHILE CONTINUING TO KEEP OUR ECONOMY THRIVING IN THIS BUDGET. KELLY P. A REQUEST SIX POSITIONS FOR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT WITHIN OUR AGENCY THESE POSITIONS COVER TO TJ PLANNING LEAN SIX SIGMA TRAINING INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS. CONTRACT IN LABOR LAW AND ENFORCEMENT COORDINATION. OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD A COUNTY PA THAT IS TRANSPARENT EFFECTIVE AND FISCALLY PRUDENT. I BELIEVE IN GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO HELP CONFRONT CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. AT THE SAME TIME CAL EPA CAN DO MORE TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS AND MAINTAIN PUBLIC TRUST. ESTABLISHING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE BOARDS DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES IS A TOP PRIORITY. SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR AND ARE KIND OF GO THROUGH THE PRESENT POSITION THE FEST RELATES TO STRATEGIC PLANNING. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES NEEDED TO SHAPE ORGANIZATIONAL THINKING A LINE PRIORITIES REFOCUS ENERGY AND RESOURCES AND STRENGTHENING OPERATIONS IS DEVELOP. A STRATEGIC PLANNING CULTURE AND PRACTICE FOR THE AGENCY THIS LEVEL OF PLANNING AND CRITICAL THINKING WILL ENSURE THAT THE AGENCY IS WORKING TOWARDS COMMON GOALS. AND HOLDING US ACCOUNTABLE FOR OUTCOMES AND RESULTS. THIS POSITION WILL ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW AGENCY WHITES GIGI PLANNING PROCESS OUR FOCUS WILL BE ON PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT. AND THE INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION BETWEEN AND AMONG SIDEBOARDS DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES. THE ENVIRONMENT DOES NOT ADHERE TO STRICT STOVE PIPES AND NORTH NEITHER SHOULD WE THE SECOND RELATES TO LEAN SIX SIGMA. WE WANT TO CREATE A CULTURE OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT FOR CALLIE PA AND THE BDO'S BUILT UPON A PLATFORM USING. LEAN PRINCIPLES AND TOOLS. ONE OF OUR MAIN OBJECTIVES OBJECTIVES IS IMPROVING HOW CALIBRATE OPERATES AS AN AGENCY. AND I PLAN TO DO THIS BY CREATING A CULTURE OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. USING IT LEAN SIX SIGMA. I VISION SECTOR-LIMÃ³N ALSO STOP YOU THERE BECAUSE I REALIZE THAT YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF THE CATHOLIC CLIMATE ACTION TEAM AND THE SECRETARY HAS BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE CLIMATE ACTION TEAM. FOR EIGHT YEARS DO YOU BEEN WORKING NOT ONLY INTERNALLY BUT EXTERNALLY ACROSS DIFFERENT. DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO PLAN STRATEGICALLY. ISN'T SOME OF THAT WORK ALREADY DONE THAT YOU'VE DONE AT LEAST IN THE CLIMATE. ADAPTATION RESILIENCY OF MEDIUM THAT THAT. YOU WOULD HAVE A GUY I THINK YOU'VE BEEN DOING THAT OR YOUR PREDECESSORS DID YOU AT THE OFFICE HAS BEEN DOING THAT. FOR THE LAST THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WHAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THIS AT THIS. SUPERVISOR WOULD BE DOING OUR THAT. YOU HAVE IN THE APARTMENT HAS HAVE YOU ALREADY THAT. COMING IN THE DOOR I'M ESPECIALLY WITH THE CONTEXT OF OF A PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- I THINK WE DO DO A REALLY GOOD JOB. AT CAL EPA OF COORDINATING WITH OTHER AGENCIES OTHER DEPARTMENTS EVEN EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS WE DO A MUCH LESS GOOD JOB OF COORDINATING INTERNALLY. THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR OWN STRATEGIC PLANS I'M BOTH IN TERMS OF THE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS STRATEGIC METRICS OF SUCCESS. HOW WAY COMMUNICATING TO OUR PUBLICS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND HOW WE'RE DOING IT IS VERY LITTLE COORDINATION INTERNALLY SO THIS WOULD BE? A PASS AND THAT SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE WITHIN CALLIE PA'S BOARDS APARTMENT OFFICES. I'M I'M HAVE STRATEGIC PLANS OF A LAST ON IN. TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT I'M NOT A MORE RECENT NONE OF THEM COORDINATE AND AND WORK TOGETHER. TO MAKE SURE ALL WE ARE PROVIDING SERVICES TO ALL OUR PUBLICS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE RATING TOGETHER INTERNALLY SO THIS IS REALLY. I'M I WANNA MAKE SHOW ON OUR WEBSITE THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT ANY ISSUE RELATED TO CALLIE PA AND WATER METRICS OF SUCCESS ARE WHERE WE ARE AGAINST THEM. AND ALSO CHAT REALLY THIS RELATES TO PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT I WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL OUR STAFF. I'M HAVE CLEAR GOALS THAT RELATE TO CLEAR STRATEGIC PLANS. THAT SUCCESS IS DRIVEN BY A HOLISTIC FRAME WORKING CURRENTLY IT'S VERY PIECEMEAL AND AD HOC WITHIN THE AGENCY. AND AND REALLY I GUESS IS GOES TO SOMETHING THAT I I COULD HAVE PREFACED I WANT TO BE. I'M COGNIZANT OF THE OF THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE TODAY. REALLY HOURS SORRY I'LL GOAL CHAT IS. TO REALLY. THINK OF CAL EPA AS THE COORDINATING AND I'M. THE THE ENTITY THAT CAN HELP BRING THE TV PLANNING SKILLS CAN HELP BRING LEAN SIX SIGMA TO CREATE EFFICIENCY. AND HELP BRING COORDINATION ON ENFORCEMENT I'M. AND CAN HELP TO INTERNAL COMMUNICATION SO THAT WE'RE PROVIDING REAL VALUE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING BUT ALSO TO EXTERNAL AUDIENCES SO ALL. OF THESE POSITIONS REALLY COMING IN THE DOOR. I'M AYE I RECOGNIZE THAT IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE AND SERVE YOU AND THE PUBLIC WELL WE NEED A BETTER JOB IN COORDINATING SOME OF THESE FUNCTIONS WHICH AT THE MOMENT. ARE COMPLETELY AND YOU THINK IS IS THE IS THE BECAUSE I SEE THE CAT WORKING HORIZONTALLY WITH STATE GOVERNMENT YOU'RE TALKING A MORE VERTICAL -- AN INTERNAL I GUESS INTERNAL -- PLAN AND THEN MEASURED OUTCOMES RIGHT ASSEMBLY WE'RE GONNA HAVE MEASURED OUTCOMES FROM THIS. STRATEGIC PLAN RIGHT YES SAYS. I'M NOT TO PUT TOO FINE A POINT AYE BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF AND AND IMPORTANT FOCUS I'M. HISTORICALLY ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND I AND I THINK WITHIN THE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THERE IS A FOCUS ON THOSE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ALL THE OTHER BOARDS AND DEPARTMENTS. I'M VETOED LATER IN THE DAY YOU'LL BE TALKING ABOUT DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL -- CARRY CYCLE MAKING SURE THAT -- FOR INSTANCE ON EMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE THAT OR LIBEL DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH -- YES AND THE OTHER AGENCIES -- SOMETHING THAT WE NEED WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE KIND OF I'M FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THESE POSITIONS IS TO IS TO ASK. FOR A SINGLE PERSON TO DO TRAINING. EVERYTHING FROM ETHICS TRAINING TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING TO LEADERSHIP TRAINING. I'M TO SKILLS COMPETENCY AND ASSESSMENT TO CLOSING THE SKILLS GAP. I'M THROUGH TARGETED TRAINING THAT CURRENTLY ISN'T HAPPENING AND SO. WITH AN ORGANIZATION REACHES A CERTAIN SIZE AND MAGNITUDE TO TO HAVE THOSE. ABSENT REALLY PREVENTS US FROM REACHING OUR GOALS I'M SO THAT THE NOT A LOT OF POSITIONS AS ONE FOR EACH OF THESE. DISCIPLINES. ANOTHER DOES BRING UP IS LEGAL SUPPORT SO. I'M. YOU KNOW I I HAVE A BACKGROUND AS AN ATTORNEY BUT WHEN IT COMES. TO SOMEONE TO REVIEW LARGE CONTRACTS BEFORE THEY GO OUT THE DOOR. I WANNA MAKE SURE SOMEONE IN OUR OFFICE IS DOING THAT I'M AS YOU'LL HEAR CARRY CYCLE LET A BILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. I WANNA MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE OVERSIGHT AND ABILITY TO MAKE SURE ALL THAT ALL THE I'S DOTTED ANTES ACROSS BEFORE CONTRACTS OF THAT MAGNITUDE GO OUT. THE SAME IS TRUE I'M. I'M WITH ISSUES LIKE INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS WHICH IS ANOTHER ONE I'M. OFF DON'T KNOW ACROSS PROGRAMS WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE'S NO INTERNAL. NEWSLETTER OF MANY OF THE AGENCIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WHAT'S HAPPENING AMONGST IN BETWEEN SO THESE ARE ALL KIND OF NOT WILL NOT NOT A LARGE BUDGET REQUEST BUT IT REALLY DOES GO TO THE POINT THAT. WE CAN DO IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER JOB HELPING OUT STAFF I'M HELPING COORDINATE THE FINAL ONE I'M THAT I'LL JUST BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO IS ENFORCEMENT COORDINATION [inaudible] I'M. AND THIS IS ONE PARTICULARLY -- THAT I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME FOR FOCUSED ON YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO DO THAT LACK OF TARGETING ENFORCEMENT. MAKING SURE WE KNOW. I'M. ACROSS THE ENTIRE BOARD OF CALLIE PA HOW WE'RE DOING IT. I'M WHO WAS HAVING. WHAT THE DOC IT LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED SOMEONE TO COORDINATE ENFORCEMENT? I'M AT AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THESE POSITIONS ALL REALLY GO. TO THE TO THAT GOAL OF OF BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. CREATING EFFICIENCIES THROUGH TRAINING THROUGH LEAN SIX SIGMA I'M WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB. HELPING DELIVER PROGRAMS ARE CUSTOM AS OF WE DO IT IN A MORE EFFICIENT MANNER. WITHOUT REDUCING THE PROTECTIONS THAT THE PUBLIC [inaudible] REQUIRE. LA -- YOU HAVE A COMMENT IS JOHN MY WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE MEANING WITHIN BROADLY THAT THE PROPOSAL'S LITTLE HAS MERIT THE GOALS IN THE PROPOSAL A MATCH. WHEN WE READ THROUGH IT THERE ARE NO DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN? pCALLIE PA WAS THE INTENSE TO ACHIEVE SO FOR EXAMPLE THE PROPOSAL REQUEST A POSITION TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP FOR TRAINING PROGRAM BUT IT DOESN'T IDENTIFY THE TYPES OF TRAINING. ALTHOUGH THE SECRETARY JUST IDENTIFIED A FEW OF THEM -- THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED THE NUMBER STATE EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD RECEIVE THE SPECIFIC TRAINING OR THE TIME FRAME FOR WHEN THE TRAINING WOULD BE STARTED AND COMPLETED. SO BEFORE BUT APPROVING THE PROPOSAL AND WE RECOMMEND THAT CALLIE PA TESTIFY PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ON THE EXISTING SHORTCOMINGS BEEN ADDRESSED TO THINK THE SECRETARY HAS.

AT THAT MATTERS THREE VOTES TO KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS [inaudible] OKAY. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO PART EIGHT THIS IS A CALIFORNIA P. YOU SEE LET'S DO THE WILDFIRES. ISSUE FIRST IS TO BE ISSUE NUMBER [inaudible] THIRTEEN PART A CALIFORNIA ENERGIES FUTURE SIXTEEN POSITIONS. FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER. THIRTEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS PROPOSES SIXTEEN POSITIONS FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS -- IN THIS YEAR. THE CHAIRMAN AND SENATE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BERNARD AS A VETO. AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TODAY WE HAVE THE P. C. REPRESENTATIVES HERE TO ADDRESS ISSUES. THIRTEEN AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR HEARING THIS MOTION FIRST. AND NUMBER TWELVE LATER WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. OKAY -- HE HAS SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SWAT TEAM. CONCERNS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND THIS PROPOSAL HAS KIND OF THREE DISTINCT COMPONENTS ONE IS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT. TO CONTRACT WITH AN OUTSIDE ENTITY TO HELP WITH ENFORCEMENT OF WILDFIRE MEDICATIONS PLANS FOR ONE YEAR. THIRTEEN MILLION AGAIN ONE TIME CONTRACTING RESOURCES TO HELP THE COMMISSION -- IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF KIND OF THEIR WIRES WILD FIRE MITIGATION POLICY DEVELOPMENT WHILE FOR ME TO GET SOME PLANS AND A LONG TERM VISION FOR THOSE PLANS. AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF RESOURCES THAT WOULD WORK ON ACTIVITIES RELATED. TO A POWER SHUT OFFS AS WELL AS CAN OF REFORMS TO INTERNAL PROCESSES OF THE PC. SO IN CONCEPT WE THINK THAT THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE MERIT AS PART OF THE STATE'S OVERALL APPROACH TO REDUCING WILDFIRE RISK -- HOWEVER THERE'S NO CLEAR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES OR ESTIMATES OF OUTCOMES THAT YOU SEE EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE BUT THOSE RESOURCES. AND IT'S UNCLEAR HOW YOU SEE WILL USE THAT X. IS EXPERIENCE WITH THESE ONE TIME RESOURCES TO INFORMANTS LONG TERM WILD FIRE MITIGATION ENFORCEMENT. STRATEGY SO RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT AS ARE ALL REQUIRING THE PC TO REPORT BY APRIL OF NEXT YEAR. ON HOW MUCH FUNDING -- IT IS SPENT. FOR THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WHAT OUTCOMES IT HAS ACHIEVED AND HOW THE X.. THIS WILL HELP IN ENHANCE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN ENFORCEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. SO FINANCE ARE WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO ADD YOU KNOW TYPICALLY WE THINK OF THE YOU SEE YOU'VE GOT TO ESTABLISH INTERVENOR AS OF THE HIGH STATUS THEN YOU COME IN. IT'S NOT THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANNING. I AGENCY I GUESS IS GENERALLY WOULD SAY WHAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK I SEE ABOUT THE ALEJO'S OBSERVATIONS I MEAN MARTIN DEPARTMENT FINANCE? I'M. WE ARE -- INTEND TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUESTED BY YOUR STAFF AND BY THE LA -- PLAYED BY THE END OF TODAY -- IF IN IN TERMS OF HOW SOME OF THESE IN THIS INFORMATION. CONTACTED HIM ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE SUB MODEL COURTING LANGUAGE BUT PART OF THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS. THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU SEE IS JUST UNDERGONE THEIR FIRST ROUND OF WELFARE MEDICATION PLANTS THEY ARE REVIEWING -- AND APPROVING WHAT WAS GIVEN TO THEM. THESE RESOURCES. ARE THESE RESOURCE SAID WOULD BE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE STRUCTURING THESE PLANS CORRECT IS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS BEEN DONE AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. WE'RE NOT JUST REACTING TO WHAT ARE IN THE PLANS BUT DIRECTING EVEN MORE STRONGLY. THESE ARE COMPONENTS WE EXPECT TO SEE IN THEM FURTHERMORE -- THIS. PLEASE RESOURCES WOULD HELP HOW TO CLOSE THE GAP IN. CERTAIN AREAS LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING WHERE THERE IS NOT CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES I'M WITHIN. THE UTILITIES OR SOMETHING SACRAMENTO THIS WOULD HELP YOU'RE GOING TO BRING THAT TOGETHER -- AND SO -- WE THINK THAT THESE RESOURCES WILL HELP MOVE FORWARD. I'M STRONGER WATER MITIGATION PLAN TO ALSO. TO HELP WITH. MAKING SURE THAT WHEN A UTILITY SAYS IT'S DOING ITS MITIGATION PLAN SOMEONE GOES ON SAYS YEP YOU SAY THAT YOU. FOR EXAMPLE TRIM THE TREES I SEE THAT THE TREES ARE TRIMMED NOW GRANTED AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA SB NOT A ONE EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN IN A FEW YEARS. GIVEN THE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WERE UNDER AMEND THE VERY -- PAST OF WILD FIRES WE THINK GETTING SOME GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THAT SHOULD LOOK LIKE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER IS APPROPRIATE. AND THAT CAN ALSO BE USED TO HELP -- DEVELOP THE CRITERIA AROUND. WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS REALLY GOOD AT DOING THIS AND HOW BIG IS THE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF COMPLIANCE RIGHT NOW RATHER THAN WAITING? FOR A COUPLE YEARS WHEN THAT GOES INTO EFFECT. IT IS. THAT IS GOOD QUESTION OF WHAT'S THE PERSON ARE. IT'S REALLY GOOD ABOUT DOING THIS I LOVE THE P. YOU SEE WITH ALL RESPECT IS I KNOW I KNOW THAT NINE A ONE PUT IT THERE. AND AS I READ THROUGH THE STAFF REPORT AND I LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND I LOOK AT THIS. THE CHECK. FIVE PART PLAN I'M THINKING [inaudible] MAYBE WE PUT THIS IN THE WRONG AGENCY BE GOING ABOUT. MOVING THESE PLANS GIVING THE RECEIVE THOROUGHNESS THAT MOST OF THESE HEARINGS GO THROUGH TO GET TO A DECISION. IT MAY BE TOO LONG WE MAY BE SITTING HERE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WAITING FOR THE PLAN TO BE APPROVED I KNOW I DON'T THINK WE EXPECT WITH. YOU THAT. I GET A GET A PHONE CALL AFTER I SAID THAT -- MEMBERS CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WE SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THIS THERE'S COM. THREE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST FOR ON GOING ADDITIONAL STAFF TO HELP OVERSEE UTILITY POWER SHUT OFFS AND REFORM. INTERNAL CPUC PROCESSES. CAN YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT HOW THAT THREE MILLION GETS ALLOCATED RELATED TO THE THE UTILITY WANTS TO SHUT OFF POWER -- IN A HIGH RISK FIRE AREA DO WE KNOW HOW HOW MANY POSITIONS IS THIS AND ARE THEY OUT IN THE FIELD IS THE UTILITY. HAVE TO COORDINATE WITH KEY YOU SEEN. STAFF PERSON BEFORE THE POWER GET SHUT OFF. ANYONE ADDRESS SENT -- EMILY'S IF YOU'RE MOTION COME THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FOR SAFETY AND ENFORCEMENT POLICY. ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR SIX OF POSITIONS RELATED TO THE WELL. OUR SHUT OFF -- PROGRAM -- CURRENTLY WE DO NOT HAVE ANY DEDICATED STAFF OF FOUR FOUR D. IMAGES ATION. AND THE EXPERIENCE ALL OF LAST YEAR ALL MEN AND THE WORK THAT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE THEN TO HALL OF THE UTIITIES ESTABLISH THIS PROGRAM. IS INDICATING TO US THAT WE REALLY NEED DEDICATED STAFF. OUT WITH THE STAFF WOULD BE DOING IS THAT THE ABLE TO BE EXPERTS IN UTILITY BELT PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES FOR D. ENERGIES LACE RUN. OUT WHEN UTILITIES ARE ACTIVATING -- IT DID DURING WEATHER CONDITIONS OF THOSE STAFF WOULD BE LAUNCHING UTILITY ACTIVITIES. AND OVERSEEING -- HOW? THE UTILITIES ARE MAKING DECISIONS RIGHT NOW THE THE WAY THAT THE THE PROGRAM WORKS IS THAT. FOR A PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE THE UTILITIES HOW THE RATE TO SHUT OFF POWER IF THEY BELIEVE THE CANNOT OPERATE THEIR SYSTEM SAFELY. SO WE DID NOT THAT THIS POINTS EXPECT THAT. THE STATE -- WOULD BE MAKING THAT DECISION BUT WE WANT TO PROVIDE VERY THOROUGH OVERSIGHT AND ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT WE'RE INSISTS THE P. EATING. OUT WTH THE POWER SHUT OFF PROGRAMS WITH UTILITIES PROBABLY USING THEM A LOT MORE FREQUENTLY ESPECIALLY UP NORTH. HELP WITH THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT STAFF. TO OVERSEE WHAT THE UTILITIES ARE DOING AND THEN ALSO PERFORM AFTER ACTION. REVIEWS AND REPORTS -- THE STAFF WOULD ALSO BE. COORDINATING WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES PARTICULARLY WITH CALLAWAY YES ANTICIPATED THE WOULD BE. PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN THE EOC WHEN HOME. WHEN IT'S ACTIVATED ELEMENT AND WOULD ALSO HELP WITH OF THE KING OF COORDINATION BETWEEN UTILITIES STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS? DURING THE AND RELATIONS. THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL SO. UTILITIES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION ON THEIR OWN. ARE THEY OBLIGATED TO ALERT THE PC IF THEY EXERCISE THAT AUTHORITY. YES THEY ARE THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE -- PROTOCOL DEVELOPED FOR NOTIFICATION ALL OF US. AGENCIES INCLUDING PC AND CAL WE A NOTIFICATIONS TO LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. THE GAME MORE QUESTIONS CAN ON THE POLICY SIDE SOMEONE TRYING. TO THE BUDGET. TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THESE THIRD PARTY FOLKS IS THERE SOME SORT OF A LIST OF PEOPLE THAT. YOU GET A YOU WORK WITH BECAUSE I KNOW THAT CAL FIRE WE WANT TO CAL FIRE TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE. OUT THERE DOING THE WORK NOT CONFIRMING THAT THEY DID WORK WE KEEP. HAMMERING THE I'LL USED TO GET OUT AND TO WORK AS THEY'VE BEEN DOING MORE -- WE'VE GOT TO SEE IT CAN'T CONSERVATION CORPS WERE GIVING THEM MORE MONEY TO DO THE WORK SO. WHERE DO WE NEED YOU GUYS HAVE A LIST OF PEOLE TO GET IT CHECKED FOR COMPLIANCE THAT THE I. O. U.'S ARE DOING IT? OMIT SO L.. CURRENTLY THERE ARE BILL INDEPENDENCE WE'RE STATE. INSPECTORS DID GO OUT THERE AND INSPECT UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SO THE WAY THAT THE THE SORT OF THE THE SAFETY PARADIGMS WORK TO DATE. IS THAT THE P. YOU SEE SAFETY FUNCTIONS TO PERFORM AUDITS SO IT'S A MOSTLY A RECORD. AUDIT THE DO YOU. PERFORM WORKING PLANS WITH THE COMMISSION'S GENERAL ORDERS WE DID NOT GO OUT AND PATROL ALSO NEED THE CAL FIRE DOES NOT WORKING WITH THE P. YOU SEE AND THERE CURRENTLY ARE NO INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES AS ENVISIONED BY SB NINE OH ONE THAT HASN'T. PROCESS HASN'T BEEN SET UP YET. SO WHERE THE THIS CONTRACT WOULD DEAL IS. IN THE INTERIM WHILE WE CAN OF WORK ON THE LONG TERM SOLUTION IS BRING ON AT LEAST SOME INSTANCE SPECTER STAFF SO WE CAN SEND START SENDING OUT PEOPLE IN THE FIELD TO VERIFY. THE CONDITIONS. ON THE GROUND ALL THE MOST SIMILAR WORK TO THIS THAT'S BEEN DONE BY THE COMMISSION WAS A CONTRACT THAT WE ENTERED INTO AFTER SEEM BRUNO PIPELINE EXPLOSION WHERE THE PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC WAS DIRECTED. HELLO. TO HELP PUT IN PLACE BY PLANE SAFETY ENHANCEMENT PLANS THAT WAS TESTING OR REPLACING -- TRANSMISSION PIPELINES AND WE HAD A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT OF THE TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT THAT THE P. YOU SEE SIGNED AFTER THAT THE BUREAU VERITAS. HOME TO GO OUT IN THE GOVERNMENT THE P. YOU SEE STAFF -- TO VERIFY THE WORK THE P. JEANNIE WAS DOING OUT IN THE FIELD. AND ELM BE REVERED SIZE ALSO DOES SIMILAR WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AROUND POWER PLANTS SO THEY GENERALLY KIND OF DO THIS TYPE OF CONTRACTS WITH THE WITH THE STATE'S AND ELHAM. AT WORLDWIDE FOR DIFFERENT REGULATORY AGENCIES TO THE HOW THE CAPACITY TO ELM -- TO HIRE -- LINEMAN JOURNEYMEN FOR EXAMPLE AND TRAIN THEM UP TO GO OUT IN THE FIELD AND DO THIS TYPE OF ACTION SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF ONE COMPANY THAT DOES THAT TYPE OF WORK THERE ARE OTHERS. ALL MY THAT HOW OF OF BEEN CONTACTING. ME WITH RESPECT TO THIS KIND OF WORK SO I THINK WHEN WE PUT IT OUT TO COMPETITIVE BID WE WILL HELP. YOU KNOW SEVERAL OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM BUT THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE. FOR HOW IT'S BEEN DONE IN SIMILAR CASES. YEAH I JUST HAVE I JUST HAVE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS I KNOW THAT WE RUSHED OUT AND WE DID LEGISLATION WE RUSHED OUT WE STE ESTABLISH THIS. QUICK REPORT THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO IT AND I'M JUST SITTING HERE. SAYING WHY IS THE P. YOU SEE COULD LEAD THE WAY. ON ARE THESE THE THE STRIKE TEAM ON THE AFFECTS OF DESTABILIZING HOW THE WIRE FIRES HAVE WE'RE IT'S NOT MY IDEA I I KNOW IT'S BIGGER PEOPLE UP THERE I'M JUST WONDERING HOW WE GAVE YOU GUYS THIS CHARGE. AND YOU'RE GOING. TO CREATE A STRIKE TEAM OUT OF YOU KNOW AT THIS TO SOME LONG TERM STRATEGIC PLANNING AND AND BUILD UP SOME STAFF AND THINKING. WHAT MADE US THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE? UNDER YOUR ROOF. I MEAN I SEE THAT YOU YOU YOU GET YOU GOT A JOB THEY ASK YOU TO DO IT SO YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE BEST JOB YOU CAN'T BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU GUYS DO. ELEMENT A THING THE THE HELPING A LARGE IN THE FIELD INSPECTION THE WORKFORCE IS ELM. DEFINITELY WOULD BE E. L.. A DIFFERENT FUNCTION FOR THE COMMISSION WOULD GENERALLY A REGULATORY BODY IN THE POLICY MAKING BODY LOTS OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND ITS SCALE KIND OF BODY. ARMOR I THINK THE CAN OF OVER OLD. YOU KNOW IF IF I WAS TO SPECULATE ELM IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU SEE HOUSING -- OVERALL AUTHORITY OVER UTILITIES. AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF AND COSTS AND SO BECAUSE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS UTILITY OWNED GOES FALLS OF THE PC. TO WORK THROUGH ALL OF THE ISSUES. RELATED TO THIS CHALLENGE WHERE. IN THE UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK LONG TERM YOU KNOW WE THEY CAN BE THIS CONVERSATIONS HOW TO WHAT IS A LONG TERM STRATEGY FOR IT AND IF THE PC IS THE BEST THE AGENCY TO DO CERTAIN FIELD WORK AS AN EXAMPLE. BUT AGAIN I THINK THE THOUGHT BEHIND THE CONTRACT AND WHY IT'S OF IN THE SHORT TERM BETTER TO DO IT THIS WAY IS BECAUSE IT GIVE STATES FLEXIBILITY. TO COME UP WITH THE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS OF MAY AND MAY NOT INVOLVE THE P. YOU SEE DOING IT BUT I THINK WE BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A CRITICAL RISK LEVEL RIGHT NOW I THINK THIS A GENERAL. DESIRE BY BY THE PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDERS TO JUST HAVE SOMEBODY GOING OUT DOING PATROLS ALL WHILE WE ARE SORT OF DISCUSSING LONG TERM SOLANO I DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE WITH SOMEBODY SHOULD OUT. CONTROLS I JUST SAY YOU KNOW NORMALLY WE THINK OF YOU GUYS AND THAT -- THE ADVOCATE WHAT'S THE HOW THE REPAIRS BEING AFFECTED AND THAT'S NOT THE SKILL SET THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WITH THIS TASK RIGHT HERE. FINANCE YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING THAT. BECAUSE IT IS ONE TIME OVER THREE YEARS -- THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN THAT'S UP TO CLEAN EVERYTHING WAS COME FROM AND MAKE THAT POLICY DETERMINATION WHETHER P. YOU SEE LONG TERM SHOULD BE DOING THIS OR WHETHER ANOTHER ENTITY SHOULD. AND WE WOULD THEN HAVE THE DATA AND EXPERIENCE. TO GET A A GOOD SENSE OF WHERE THEY SHOULD BE I MEAN I JUST. THE THE A NEW REPORT TALK OF A A MORE EFFECTIVE CPUC THE WORD SENATOR THINKING NOT EXPAND I LEAST I WASN'T. MISTER BROWN CAN YOU ARE HELPING I I MEAN I'M JUST JUST TO REITERATE I THINK THAT I THINK IS IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT SORT OF HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF KIND OF HAVING GOOD INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO YOU AND KIND OF YOU KNOW HAVING THEM REPORT BACK ON WHAT OUTCOMES HAVE. BEEN SHE'D HOW EFFECTIVE THEY THEN AND IN A WAY THAT CAN INFORM THESE TYPES OF BROADER -- DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD ABOUT KIND OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT THESE ACTIVITIES IN THE MOSTEFFECTIVE WAY AND WE'RE WE'RE TO PUT THEM. WE'RE GONNA HOLD THE MATTER SO I CAN GET TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO THINK ABOUT IT. ENTER MCGUIRE HAVE QUESTION THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER CHAIR I'M GONNA FOCUSING ON THE THREE MILLION FOR ONGOING. DISTRUST AFTER OVERSEE THAT UTILITY POWER SHUT OFF. NO THE PC'S REACTING TO WHAT THE DIRECTION HAS BEEN AND JUST BEING VERY CANDID ABOUT THIS. I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN ANY COUNTING THE CITY CALIFORNIA'S BEEN IMPACTED BY THE BATTERY POWER SHUT OFF. MORE THAN THE COUNTY OF LAKE IN. ALL DUE RESPECT TO NOT AT ALL TRYING TO THROW STONES THE YOU SEE THE LAST. ORGANIZATION AN EMERGENCY OFFICIALS. HOW TRAINS ARE GOING TO CALL ABOUT CHALLENGESWITH POWER SHUT OFF TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION? THE FIRST CALL WENT TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IT IS BEEN A HOT MESS. ARE ALL LAST YEAR WHEN WE SAW TWO SIGNIFICANT. SHOT OFF BY P. JEANNIE LAKE COUNTY. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLANNING. THERE WAS NO PLAN FOR SIX HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ARE WHO WERE ON MY SUPPORT. N. WITHIN HOURS OF THE POWER BEING SHUT OFF. THE GENIE REQUIRED THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. I DO GO CONSULTER TURNING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE HEALTH RECORDS OF THOSE SIX INTERNET VIGILS THAT WERE SOON GONNA LOSE THEIR POWER. SO. I OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES. IT WAS THE ONE THAT THEY CALLED TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST. IN WHO ARE STAFF. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SO IF THIS IS AN ISSUE OF OVERSIGHT AND UTILITIES. OKAY. BUT WHERE I HAVE CONCERNS IS IN THAT REAL TIME ISSUE AND WHY WERE PUT IN THIS MONEY. INTO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES. THERE IS GOING TO NEED TO BE. FOCUS ON THAT REAL TIME ISSUE I AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WERE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND I COULD HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND IF YOU. DO YOU SEE ON THIS AS WELL. IF I MAY M.. JUST ADD SOMETHING OF WHEN THIS HAPPENED LAST YEAR IN FULL HOME. I FLEW TO SACRAMENTO ON THE SUNDAY AND WAS AT YES AT THE REQUEST BECAUSE OVER YES DOES NOT HALL OF IN DEPTH EXPERTISE ON UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. HOME AND THEY WANTED THE LIAISON IN THE WE ELSE THAT CAN WORK WITH UTILITIES AND HOLD ON ANALYZE THE INFORMATION THAT THE UTILITIES WERE GIVING. THE FOR EXAMPLE THE UTILITIES WOULD ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT DATED THE HELP OR DON'T HELP OR CANNOT CANNOT SHARE. AND WHERE THE PC ROLE COMES IN IS THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY L. ENGAGE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND MAYBE. EL. SUPPORT WE US WHEN THE TRYING TO GET CERTAIN INFORMATION OR PROVIDE THEM INFORMATION ABOUT. HOW THE UTILITY PROGRAM WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK HOME SO? IN MY EXPERIENCE. IS THAT WE S. ONCE THE PC PRESENCE IN THERE AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE HOME WE HAVE BEEN MEETING VERY REGULARLY WITH THE BUT ALL OF THAT WORK IS BEING DONE BY MYSELF ANOTHER PROGRAM MANAGERS. AS THE SORT OF IN ADDITION TO OUR JOB FUNCTIONS AND THEN IN JUST MY EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE PRESENT THERE FOR EVERY TIME THERE'S A P. S. P. S. EVENTS. SO I'M WORRIED THAT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR THE P. C. WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE WITH -- YES ALTHOUGH I ALSO SUPPORT HUMMING GIVING THEM ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THIS WORK. WHERE THE CASE -- WOULD. I FIT IN IN THE DISCUSSIONS WITH -- E. S. AND YOU SEE AN THE CALIFORNIA BEFORE AT THIS IN THE IN WHAT INFORMATION DO THEY BRING THAT YOU DON'T HAVE AS FAR AS YOU KNOW. WEIRD THE BALLOT HOW THE BALANCING IS WORKING IF THEY TURN OFF THIS SECTION OF IT NOW THEY RESTORE THAT WITH. THEY CAN SEE SEEM AYE. I UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE EXPERTISE IN THIS THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF THAT. I'M SORRY WERE YOU ASKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE CHI SO RIGHT THE ROLE THE CHI SO -- COULD CERTAINLY ENGAGES IN THE IN WHERE IT'S IMPACTING TRANSMISSION AND GRID RELIABILITY SO MOST OF THESE EVENTS OF THESE TO DATES. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON CUSTOMERS IT'S THE DISTRIBUTION LEVEL SO IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T INVOLVE THE CHI SO. ALL MY SO SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGING WITH KAISER TO TALK ABOUT SITUATIONS WHERE. YOU ME HOW DO YOU ENERGY SOLUTION EVENTS AT SCALE THAT IMPACT TRANSMISSION BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN EXPERIENCED YET I MEAN WE WOULD STILL AS THE P. YOU SEE ABOUT POINTS. OUT NEED TO WORK WITH THE CHI SO AND THE OF THE STATE PARTNERS LIKE OR WE ASK TO SORT OF MANAGE THE ODDS EL EVENTS. OF BUT AGAIN IN THE MOST SITUATIONS THE WITH TALKING ABOUT WOULD YOU ENERGY STATION CASE WAS ACTUALLY NOT IN ANY WAY INVOLVED BECAUSE IT'S BELOW TRANSMISSION. OKAY AND YOU HAVE THE AS THE STING PUSH FROM THE UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE IN GENERAL RIGHT YOU JUST HAVE THE TRANSMISSION. YES THE BECAUSE HE'S JUST THE IT IT'S MANAGING THE GRADE LEVEL RELIABILITY OF THE TRANSMISSION LEVEL VERSES THE DISTRIBUTION WIRES THAT ARE KIND OF DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMER HOMES WHICH IS ON-THE UTILITY. OPERATION THANK YOU CENTER MIGHT REQUIRE INTERRUPTED. JUST. AND YOU I I KNOW IF YOU WANT TO MENTION THAT I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION ON THIS ISSUE PLEASE. THIS NOVEMBER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOESN'T HAVE A GOOD SEVENTY FIVE MILLION -- FOR YEAH SO THIS IS THIS IS A A COORDINATED -- EVERGLADES RELATE TO POWER SHUT DOWN AND ALSO AS SHE MENTIONED YOU SEE IS THERE WITH -- YES WHEN THESE WHEN THESE EVENTS ARE HAPPENING AND HAS TO FILL THAT ROLE AS REGULAR OF THE UTILITIES RELATED TO INFORMATION. I'M OF THE TOYS MAY HAVE IN TERMS OF WHO IS ON PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT INDICATE THAT THEY'RE ON LIFE SUPPORT OR THIS KIND OF THING SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT REGULATORY FUNCTION. STILL CONTINUES AND WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR POWER SHUT OFF TO GET TO THE IN THE DISK IT'S DOWN TO A LITTLE BIT OF A DEEPER DIVE AND YOU ALL DON'T MIND. BUT JUST OKAY I JUST CONFIRM. SO. PC WOULD BE THERE FOR SUPPORT. BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS TH AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT SO FOR EXAMPLE. NO ONE THAT CALTRANS NOW. THAT ALL THE STOP LIGHTS CAN BE TURNED OFF. ON HIGHWAY -- TWENTY THAT WAS. ANOTHER. HE SAID A HOT MESS THAT WE HAD. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO LOOK FOR WHO IS THE COORDINATING AGENCY. AT THAT TIME AND THE THE ANSWER NOW RIGHT. THAT WE'RE GOING INTO THIS NEW ISSUE OF THE ENERGY DE ENERGIZE ATION. DURING RED FLAG EVENTS I JUST WHO'S GONNA BE COR NAME TO MY UNDERSTANDING. YOU SEE WOULD BE IN THE MORNING CENTER AT THAT TIME. INDOOR -- ROUTE PROVIDING INSULATION PORT ON THE UTILITY SIDE. BY -- YES WOULD STILL BE THE ONE THAT WOULD BE OVERSEEN -- ISSUES THAT TIME UP. EVEN BEN'S WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I ALSO ACTUALLY HAVE -- YES IN MY SAME AREA AND THE ISSUE WILL BE HEARD IN SUB FIVE IN SOME LEVEL OF DETAIL IN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS HERE BUT YES -- YES WILL BE THE ONE COORDINATING AND THEY'LL HAVE YOU SEE A NUMBER OF OTHERS OF COURSE IN THE COMMAND CENTER TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE THAT BUT BUT ESTAS COORDINATE THAT IN THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION -- IS GONNA BE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHERE WE HAVE GAPS IN CRITICAL STATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND NEED TO DO THINGS LIKE. MAKE SURE I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRE STATIONS DON'T HAVE BACKUP POWER. YEAH SO WE'RE GONNA BE ASSESSING THAT KIND OF THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS JUST LOOKING AT YEAH POTENTIAL GRANTS TO LOCAL. EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATORS FOR TAKING CARE OF ME WE WE TALK ABOUT NATIONAL NEWSPAPER ARTICLES ABOUT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE CRITICAL OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT IN THEIR HOMES AND STUFF AND WHAT WE WHAT WE DO TO SUPPORT THAT KIND OF STUFF AND YOU KNOW. THAT AB THERE'S SOME SPACE THERE NINETY HERE AND I THINK THAT'S THE PIECE THAT WE NEED TO BE A TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THAT WE SIMPLY ART AND I AM. CONCERNED AS WE GO INTO THIS SEASON WE'RE STILL NOT IN FRONT OF IT AS THIS IS RELATIVELY NEW. ESPECIALLY ON THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE LIKE READING DEVICES THAT ON THIS USE THE ISSUE WITHIN THE AREA. TAKE CENTER FOLKS HAD READING DEVICES. WITHIN LAKE AND THERE WAS NO WARNING RIGHT TRYING TO BE A TO GET IN FRONT OF THAT AND IF THERE IS I A SENIOR CENTER THAT IS ALSO BACK TUITION SENATORS HAVE BACKUP POWER. WHAT HAPPENED THAT'S JUST THAT THE PEACE I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION THAT IS WHAT IT -- YES WORKING ON BOARDING AND SCREEN WHAT IS ONE OF THE I. O. U.'S DOING WATER YOU KNOW DIFFERENT SHE'S GOING TO WEAR THE GAPS AND YES A LOT OF COORDINATION ON WORK GOING ON RIGHT NOW TO TALK THEIR SPONSOR. PARTY'S BIGGER OUT HOW WE GET AHEAD OF THIS AND YES WE CAN IT IS A FAIRLY NEW THING IN TERMS OF THE SCALE THAT WE'RE GONNA. HAVE TO APPRECIATE COVERAGE THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S ONE OF THOSE BUDGET MYSTERY WHY. THIS SUBCOMMITTEE DOESN'T HAVE -- YES BUT WE HAVE THE HIGHER TROLL YES. BUT ANOTHER. THERE ARE CERTAIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SORRY FOR MISSING THE BEGINNING YOUR PRESENTATION. BUT WE WATCHED YOU ON THE INTERNET AND PEOPLE ARE WATCHING WITH RAPT ATTENTION. THANK -- THIS WAS ONCE A ONE KEY ISSUE AND NOW IT'S VERY REAL SO I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE. FROM THE TWO ISSUES ON I'M SORRY IF I MISSED IT BUT ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE. A LITTLE BETTER SENSE OF BUT THE P. UC'S PLANNING ANOTHER. LOOKING AT THIRD PARTY. ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK SOME OF THOSE POSITIONS  JUST WANTED TO GET A LITTLE BETTER SENSE OF WHAT. NINE OH ONE ENFORCEMENT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING FOR THAT. W. M. P. A FORTUNE PROCESS AND THEN ALSO ON THIS. YES P. S. BACKUP POWER ISSUE WE DONE A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. A WIDE O WHAT THE TOTAL. NEED IS FOR QUOTE ON QUOTE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE HOW ARE WE DEFINING AND I GUESS. HOW FAR ALONG HIS SEVENTY FIVE GET US? AND WE'RE ALSO GONNA FIND THE REST. JUST MAYBE THIRTY THAT FIRST AND THEN COME BACK TO THE ENFORCEMENT ONE WE DOING. YEAH NO I THINK I'D EVEN CANDIDLY -- THIS IS A RELATIVELY NEW IN IN BIG THING AND SO I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THAT. OUT YET -- AND A BIG PART OF THIS EFFORT IS GONNA BE FIGURING OUT WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT GAPS BILL AND I THINK SOME OF IT IS FIGURING OUT WHICH AREAS WHICH REGIONS TO THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE. THE MOST HIT BY IT. I MEAN SURELY. THIRTY FIVE MILLION IS NOT GONNA GO PROBABLY GO YOU KNOW TO FILL LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE GAP WE CAN IDENTIFIES WITH THE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA BE TARGETING KIND OF PRIORITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND I I THINK JUST CANDIDLY SPEAKING WE'RE WE'RE STILL FIGURING OUT. YOU KNOW SOME OF OF WHERE THIS NEEDS TO GET FOCUSED THIS IS IN PART OF THAT THAT THIRD PRONG THE THIRTEEN MILLION THAT VISION THING THAT. UC'S COULD BE DOING ON YOUR ROAD MAP IS THAT BECAUSE HE'S TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] THE PLAN. IS THAT THE THERE'S THREE PARTS HERE. TWENTY FIVE THIRTEEN AND THREE SAID THIRTEEN IS FOR THIS. THE VISION YOU SEE VISION. I THINK ALL THOSE PARTS ARE DEFINITELY RELATED THE THIRTY MILLION IS FOR THE TWO ONE DEVELOPING THE VISION FOR HOW WE GOING TO SYSTEMATICALLY REDUCE. THE RISK OF WILDFIRE FROM ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN THE FALL OF THE AN EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS AS WELL AS CLOSE SOME OUT GAPS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN STANDARDS AND BEST PRACTICES. THANK THE ENERGY SOLUTION CAN BE PART OF ITS -- BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THE UTILITIES ARE USING I THINK WE WERE GOING INTO THE POLICY QUESTION AS TO HOW MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES MORE RESILIENCE. AND HOW MUCH IS THE STATE'S WE SHOULD BE BASICALLY INVESTING IN SO ALLOWING THEM TO ALL RIGHT OUT. LOSS OF POWER WHETHER IT'S A PROACTIVE POWER SHUT OFF WERE -- OTHER EVENTS I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY IT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE THIRTEEN MILLION THAT LEAST AS ENVISIONED IN THIS MAY. REVISE AND YOU KNOW THE ONLY THING I'D SAY ON THAT IS THAT THE STAFFING THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THE P. YOU SEE. IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEED STAFF TO BE WORKING ON THOSE QUESTIONS TO BE WORKING WITH -- WE ELSE OUGHT TO COME UP WITH HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THIS FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE AND HOW DO WE SIZE THE COST OF THIS AND HOW YOU PRIORITIZE IT AND UNLESS WE HAVE STAFF CAN BE DEDICATED TO AT HOME. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE. GET ANSWERS TO THOSE TO THOSE QUESTIONS. WHEN I WHO WE SAW IN THIS FIRST ROUNDOF WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS IT JUST CAME FORWARD? WAS VERY LIGHT. ON D. E. R. ON DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES I MEAN WE SAW A LOT OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WHICH WILL WILL TALK ABOUT LATER BUT VERY LITTLE ON SHOWING UP NOT JUST EVEN CAL FIRE STATIONS RIGHT BUT CRITICAL CIRCUITS OR SENIOR CENTERS OR STOP LIGHTS OR WATER PUMPS. YOU WATER DISTRICTS THE THINGS THAT. SO. WHAT DO YOU AND ARE THERE OTHER TOOLS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR TOOL KIT THAT? THAT ARE JUST. FROM THE GENERAL FUND THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HERE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO TACKLE THIS YEAH. YES I THINK THAT THE KING OF GOES TO THE THE REQUESTED THE CONSULTING SUPPORT. FOR THE THE OVERALL VISION AND THE THE EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS BECAUSE WE'RE IN A LITTLE BIT OF THE L. EITHER BRING THE IRAQ EXERCISE WITH UTILITIES RIGHT NOW IS BE NINE A ONE DAY A DAY OUT WE GET THE SET A REALLY GOOD FOUNDATION WITH DIRECTING. UTILITIES TO HOW WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS BUT IT DIDN'T SAY YOU KNOW. HOW WITH THE STATE'S PRIORITIES FOR MITIGATING WILDFIRES IN THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THERE'S ON THE GROUNDING THESE USING CODED CONDUCTORS THERE'S USING THE IMAGES ASIAN AND PRODUCTS BUT WERE SHOT OFF IS A RESOURCE? IS MAKING COMMUNITIES MORE RESILIENT DEPENDING ON MICROGRAMS IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS OUT THERE AND WE CURRENTLY COLLECTIVELY THE WEED THE STATE. OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT ACTUALLY HOW OF A WAY TO SAY WHAT IS THE RIGHT MIX AT THE STATE WHAT LEVEL OF HOW MUCH WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES AND BUILDING MORE MICRO GRIDS OR UNDER GROUNDING. WERE YOU KNOW VARIOUS OTHER THINGS SO MY VISION FOR WHAT WE WOULD DO WITH WITH THE CONSULTANT IS TRY TO EXCEL. THE POLICY MAKING ASPECTS OF THIS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A FRAMEWORK AND HOW THE ABILITY TO SAY HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT THE BALANCE OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING ALL OF YOU KNOW ON THE GROUNDING VERSES MORE DISTRIBUTED GENERATION FOR EXAMPLE -- AND SO AS ALL OF YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW I THINK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. TO HANDLE OF PUSH EVEN BACK ON THE UTILITY AND SAY YOU NEED TO BE DOING SOMETHING MORE ALL OF BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THOSE GOALS SET AS A STATE YET. BEFORE I WRAP YOUR LA -- DID YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD JOB OF COMMON JUST ON THE SCOPE OF NEED. TRY TO GET YOUR HEADS WRAPPED UNDER EVEN GIVING US. I'M INSIDE ON EVEN DEFINING WHAT IT WHAT IS A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. HOW TO EVEN SCOPE THAT EVERY ALL THOUGHT ABOUT? I MEAN AT I GUESS I DON'T HAVE THE A MINUTE WE I DON'T THINK WE'VE DONE THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS I MEAN I I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GREAT QUESTION IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING KIND OF THE THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING TO THINK ABOUT I MEAN. I THINK I I GENERALLY AGREE WITH SORT OF THE COMMENTS AND AND THE NEED. FOR THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS THINKING THROUGH YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE THE BEST OPTIONS OUT THERE WHAT WHICH OPTIONS ARE ACTUALLY REDUCING THEM THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF RISK AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE COST AND THAT'S LIKELY GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT ANSWER AND DIFFERENT SCENARIO SO SORT OF YOU KNOW. TRYING TO KIND OF HAVE A HAVE A MORE KIND OF FEDERAL FRAMEWORK FOR A KIND OF THINKING THROUGH THOSE QUESTIONS IN EVALUATING THOSE QUESTIONS WHICH CAN THEN KIND OF INFORM. JUST. YOU KNOW ENHANCED OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT UTILITIES ARE PROPOSING ENHANCE GUIDANCE FOR THAT THERE'S STILL A CHANCE TO EVEN AMEND THE CURRENT LEASE SUBMITTED W. MPS IS THAT CORRECT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED YET. ALL THE PROPOSED DECISION HAS MAILED WHERE RECEIVING COMMENTS RIGHT NOW AND THE ALL THREE FOR FOR ALL FOR ALL SIX YES THE THREE MAJOR IN A SMALL AS WELL AS OKAY. SO NOT JUST THE THE THREE DAYS OKAY YEAH. EL ALL THERE'S A THEIR PROPOSED DECISIONS OUT. THE PROPOSED DECISION IS OUT OF THE COMMISSION ANTICIPATES ADOPTION BY THE END OF MAY. ELEMENT THE MAIN THING THAT WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE A THING WITH THIS FIRST ROUND OF WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN TO SEND THE REALLY GOOD BASELINE. ALL IN ONE OF THE THINGS OF THE COMMISSION IS DIRECTING UTILITIES TO DO IS TO PUT PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS IN PLACE. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY START GETTING A LOT BETTER DATA ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE THE DIFFERENCE ALL PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE BECAUSE IF I WAS TO KIND OF SUM UP WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS FIRST ROUNDER WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS. SO IT IS JUST THROUGH EVERYTHING AND THE KITCHEN SINK IN THERE YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ANY ANYTHING THAT THEY COULD THINK OF TO MAYBE GET WILDFIRES AS PART OF THIS PLAN. ALL UNITS DIFFERENT YOU KNOW THE ROLE DIFFERENT BUT IT'S SORT OF EVERYTHING IS IN THERE AND YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY WAY TO EVALUATE YOU KNOW WHAT IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS REALLY A GOOD MIX OF THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS HAVE A BASELINE FROM THIS FIRST. YEAR AND GET WILL REALLY MUCH BETTER AT MEASURING PERFORMANCE AND THEN MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN WITH SOME SUPPORT FROM CONSULTANTS. ARE TALKING ABOUT THE WHAT LONG TERM ROADMAP ENVISIONED START DEVELOPING BETTER VALUATION FRAMEWORKS THEY'RE GIVING MORE DIRECTION SO UTILITIES WILL REALLY DRIVING THE BUSES THE STATE AND NOT JUST REACTING. TO THEIR PROPOSALS AND THEN CAME OF IT A RATE THE RULE AND AND HOW OF GIVE THE MORE DIRECTION OF WHAT WE THINK WE WANT THEM TO DO FOR NEXT YEAR AS YOU CAN TELL BY THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD TO SING THIS LITTLE. ITALY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT IT REALLY BEGS THE QUESTION THAT THIS IS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY. COLLABORATION AMENDED TO SAY THAT P. C. P. YU SEE. THIS COULD BECOME A MORE EFFECTIVE CPU. YOU SEE AND DO THIS YOU GOT CAL FIRE YOU GOT OH YES WE'VE GOT ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT OUR WAREHOUSES? A SYMPHONY GOING ON WHAT IS WHAT IS CAL FIRE JUNE WHAT'S THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOING HOW DOES ALL THAT. ARE WILDLIFE MITIGATION WHAT ARE THE COUNTY IS DOING A CITY SAID IN FORCE THESE YOU KNOW PARDONING OF OF THEIR THEIR PLACES HOW DOES THAT GO AND I AGAIN. IF EVERYBODY GETS INTERVENOR STATUS AND THEY CAN BILL BEFORE THE CPUC THEY'LL WORK OUT I GOT SOME CONCERNS WITH ALL WE'VE WE'VE RAISE THEM -- IT ALLOWS YOU TO SAY IS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIME ON AN APPROVAL BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU APPROVE IT AND GREAT TO GO AND DO A BUNCH OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FIND. THE LIGHTS GO OFF FOR A WEEK ON END IN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. AND WHILE WE'RE DEVELOPING HIS VISION. YEAH WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS SO HOW HOW DO WE EXECUTE COMING IN THIS BUDGET DOES IT NEED A PAUSED WE ACTUALLY TO WAIT TO GET IT RIGHT. YEAH I I DON'T SEE THE WHOLE KITCHEN SINK IN THOSE PLANS ACTUALLY SEE. JUST A LACK OF VISION THE YOU KNOW WITH. AND THAT'S NOT THE SHOWN YOU THAT WE WE NEED SOMETHING COHERENT BUT BUT WE WE CANNOT GET THROUGH ANOTHER SEASON -- IN THE DARK HERE SO. I'M WE'RE GAME TO AUTHORIZE MORE STORY I MEAN I I I'M I'M STANDING WILLING LIKE I KNOW THAT MALIBU FOR INSTANCE WHO CAN AFFORD TO PAY MORE. WILL PAY A LOT MORE. TO GET THROUGH P. S. P. S. SO CALABASAS INTEGRATE ALL THESE THERE IS THE CAN AFFORD IT ALSO THE LAKE COUNTY LAWYERS CAN'T AFFORD. RIGHT SO TO HOW TO TACKLE THAT BUT IN POWER THOSE WITH FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO GO OUT PROTECT THEMSELVES AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TERRACE DESIGNS BUT THAT'S OTHER EXPEDITED APPROVALS ON INTERCONNECTION OF SPORT DR RESOURCES. IS RUN IN A BUNCH OF DIESEL FUEL THE BACK OF FRIENDS PICK UP TRUCK TO GET TRY TO GET THE URGENT CARE CENTER BACK ONLINE SO I CAN GET MY FRIEND A TETANUS pFIRES LIKE. THAT IN A GOOD PLAN FOR FOR DOING THIS POLICY SO LIKE THERE'S WE CAN DO THIS THIS YEAR WELL YOU DEVELOP THAT VISION SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS ON THAT AND REALLY DIG IN HERE BUT I THINK. IT'S WE DON'T WANT TO OVER SUBSIDIZE ALSO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT BUT IF YOU WE HAVE ONE RATE STRUCTURE STATE WHAT RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S SORT OF AN AWKWARD -- ANY ARE THANK YOU FOR THE IN THOSE MISTER CHAIR LT'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS A MATTER THAT WE'RE GONNA HOLD OPEN OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND ISSUE NUMBER THIRTEEN PART A I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE SUBCOMMITTEE. TEEN THEN WILL CLOSE. WE'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING. SOME WORK TO DO HERE LOCAL WELL WE'RE ALL STAFF RECOMMENDATION HOLDEN MATTER OPEN. NOW LET'S LOOK OVER HIS LIFELINE PROGRAM THIS IS. ISSUE A WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THIS IS. HOW DID YOU GUYS GET THIS LIFELINE PROGRAM? WHY IS THIS LIFELINE PROGRAM IN THE C. P. U. C.? BUT GO AHEAD YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION. GOOD GOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE REQUEST FOR FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN FOR FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROGRAM. AND I CAN EITHER PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW WE CAN MOVE DIRECTLY TO QUESTIONS WHICH IS YOUR PREFERENCE. UNDER AN OVERVIEW. SEEKING FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR MILLION FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PROCREATION FOR THE LIFELINE PROGRAM FOR FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AN INCREASE OF SIXTEEN POINT 4% ON THE APPROPRIATION APPROVED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. IN COMPARING THE MAY REVISION TO THE NOVEMBER ESTIMATE. LOCAL ASSISTANCE ESTIMATE INCREASES BY EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE OF TWO FACTORS GROWTH AND PARTICIPATION. IN ADDITION A PILOTS OF THE COMMISSION RECENTLY APPROVED. THE STATE OPERATIONS ESTIMATE INCREASES BY APPROXIMATELY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. IS DRIVEN BY OUR REGION MARKING THE ELEMENTS OF THE PILOTS THAT WILL BE OCCURRING IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY LA -- DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL OR THE MORE. UNIVERSAL TELEPHONE SERVICE ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR HELP US OUT. OF IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR MIGHT OFFER JUST A FEW COMMENTS WE ACTUALLY ISSUED A REPORT RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM EARLY LAST MONTH. TALK QUICKLY JUST KIND OF RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES SO THAT THE REPORT WAS. INCLUDED AS ESTARÃ¡ LAST YEAR REQUIRING OUR OFFICE TO LOOK AT A COUPLE ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM ONE IS JUST THE BUDGETING AND THE FORECASTS FOR THE BUDGET GOING FRWARD AND SO. ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE FOUND IS NOW IN THE PAST THERE'S BEEN QUITE A FEW CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH FORECAST IN THE BUDGET FOR THIS PROGRAM. LARGELY RELATED TO THE EXPANSION TO INCLUDE THE WIRELESS AND A LOT OF THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO HOW MANY PROVIDERS ARE PARTICIPATING WHAT CASELOAD IS -- IN THE END WHAT WE THINK THE ESTIMATES ARE IMPROVING IN THAT TO YOU SEE HAS BEEN DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB RECENTLY BUT THERE CONTINUES TO BE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE SUSTENANCE AND SO. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE ESTIMATES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET BUT JUST WANTED TO THE FLAG THAT AND THAT ISSUE FOR YOU AND THERE'S CONTINUE UNCERTAINTY AND THERE IS SOME LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT PROVIDES THE ADMINISTRATION SOME FLEXIBILITY TO ADJUST IF. IF COSTS -- INCREASE BEYOND THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. THE OTHER ISSUE WITH -- WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT WAS JUST THE GENERAL ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND GETTING ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS TO ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM. AND JUST FOR CONTEXT RIGHT NOW -- ROUGHLY 40% OF THE ESTIMATED ELIGIBLE POPULATION ISN'T IS ACTUALLY ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM -- AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF POTENTIAL REASONS FOR THAT -- INCLUDING ONE THAT. HOUSEHOLD MIGHT JUST BE UNAWARE THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM AT THE PROGRAM EXISTS. TO THEY MIGHT PER -- FOR SOME OTHER KERRIER PLAN -- ONE THAT'S NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND THEN THREE THERE MIGHT BE. AREAS CHALLENGES RELATED TO IF THAT EVEN IF THEY KNOW THE PROGRAM ACCESS AND WANT TO ENROLL A GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF IN ROMAN AND RENEWALS -- UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NOT A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH OF THESE FACTORS ARE KIND OF THE PRIMARY DRIVER AND THE CURRENT ENROLLMENT RATES AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE PC TO CONDUCT. AN EVALUATION ESSENTIALLY KIND OF A SURVEY OF ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE PRIMARY BARRIERS ARE TO ACTUALLY ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM. IN THE MEANTIME THE THE LEGISLATURE MY ONE DIRECT YOU SEE ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WAS DIRECT THEM TO CONDUCT SOME PILOTS AND KIND OF EXPLORING SOME OF THE SOME POTENTIAL CHANGES THAT MIGHT ADDRESS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS. THIS PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE SOME FUNDING FOR A PILOT THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION AND WE THINK THAT'S GENERALLY A STEP IN ASK THE COMMISSION ABOUT HOW IT PLANS TO EVALUATE THAT. PILOT IN ORDER TO KINDA ATTAIN INFORMATION THAT CAN CAN HELP INFORM YOUR YOUR DECISIONS ABOUT ANY CHANGES GOING FORWARD TO TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SOME OF THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS. YOU SEE HOW DO YOU PLAN TO EVALUATE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE OHIO. WE HAVE A CURRENT PROCEEDING BEFORE THE COMMISSION AND MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT THE OTHER WAS RAISED ARE ALSO OCCURRING IN THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING. WITH REGARDS TO THE PILOTS WERE EXPLORING TWO OUT OF TWO DIFFERENT PILOTS HAS BEEN APPROVED AND THREE MORE PILOTS THAT ARE UNDER EVALUATION. AND THE TOTAL OF THE UNIVERSE OF PILOTS LOOKS AT MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT HAS BEEN RAISED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE'RE LOOKING AT STREAMLINING ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION PROCESS OF SIGNING UP FOR THE PROGRAM WE'RE LOOKING AT IMPROVING THE RENEWAL PROCESS. WERE LOOKING AT REACHING UNSERVED OR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. ARE ALSO LOOKING AT ATTRACTING OF PARTICIPANTS SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE PROGRAM WHICH MAY HAVE MORE RECOGNITION. WITH PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM SO IT MAY BE MORE DESIRABLE MAYBE THAT IS A MORE DESIRABLE OPTION. TO THOSE OF THE MAIN FACTORS THAT WERE ADJUSTING T REPEL IT'S IN THE PRECEDING WERE ALSO LOOKING AT OVERALL. HOW DO STREAMLINED THE ELIGIBILITY RENEWAL PROCESS? HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THEM THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE? BEEN CANCELED FROM THERE -- SERVICE PROVIDER YOU KNOW THAT NOT THE PEOPLE THAT JUST QUIT THE PEOPLE THAT SAY IN A GIVEN PAGER T. MOBILE OUR METRO OR SPRINT BILL THEY DROP. YOU GUYS GO CONTACT THOSE PEOPLE AND FIND OUT IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE THIS LOWER PROGRAM I MEANI'M JUST THINKING OF THE UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO. AREN'T AREN'T SOME FORMER JUST DEDICATED ON PETER FROM DON'T GOT IT BUT SOME PEOPLE JUST MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT IS THAT. AN IDEA THAT YOU GUYS KICK AROUND AT THE CPUC. THAT'S NONE IDEA WEAVER OR DIRECT EXPLAINED OR HAPPY TO EXPLORE THAT. BECAUSE THEY LOSE THEIR SERVICE I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE GAY THEY GOT THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR BILL AND THAT WOULD BE. AT THE LEAST YOU THINK MAYBE THEY NEED LIFELINE. ALL RIGHT -- THIS IS. CENTER JONES QUESTION. YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS ON HI HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY ON THE PROGRAM. AND IF YOU GET THE APPROVED ALLOCATION HOW MANY EXPECT -- TO IT TO A TO EXPAND. TO WE CURRENTLY HAVE APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION HOUSEHOLDS PER PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. AND THE TWO PILOTS TOGETHER WILL ADDED APPROXIMATELY UP TO APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL HOUSEHOLDS. SO JUST SLIGHTLY OVER TWO MILLION BUT NEVER TONIGHT YES OKAY THANK YOU. THIS IS THE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO BE APPROVED AS BUDGETED WITH AN EYE TOWARDS THE PREVIOUS MEASURE OF LOOKING FOR A MORE EFFECTIVE C.. P. UC WELL WITH THE TOOLS TO MANAGE A CHANGING UNTIL THE MARKET SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR CHARGE WE'RE ALL COULD BE LOOKING AT IT NOW. LET'S OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING ANYBODY HAS A COMMENT ON LIFELINE.

ATTORNEYS SOMEONE AND SO FORTH AND PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN -- PLANNING MITIGATING ASSESSING ALL TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT OCCUR WITHIN THE FORCE TO LANDSCAPE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WAS SURPRISED BY THE STAFF REPORT THAT THE NUMBERS OF REGISTERED. PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS IS DECLINING GIVEN. SO MUCH ATTENTION THAT WE KNOW COMPLETE. PAID TO CAL FIRE INTO THIS THIS INDUSTRY CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY THAT IS. ARE THERE IS A LOT OF MOVING PARTS AS IT RELATES TO THAT ARE THE PROGRAM'S BEEN EXISTENCE IS NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WERE. GRANDFATHERED IN TO THE PROGRAM SINCE AFTER TO TALK AND MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WORKED WITH AND FORCE OF LANDSCAPES THAT ARE FEDERALLY. MANAGED. OVER THE COURSE OF TIME IT'S BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE LICENSE DOESN'T REALLY IS NOT A NECESSITY ON FEDERAL LANDSCAPES THEREFORE WE HAVE LOST. SOME OF THE INTEREST AS IT RELATES TO US FOR SERVICE EMPLOYEES ONE TO BECOME LICENSED. WHAT IS INDIVIDUALS OF ALSO RETIRED AND SO -- ANSWERING AS THE AS RETIREMENT RATE HAS INCREASED THE LEVEL OF INTEREST IS NOT -- HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH THAT.

SEEING THE QUESTIONS FROM THE DAY AS THE CAROLINE ARCANA MOTION. THERE'S A MOTION BY CENTER REQUIRE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MY CASKEY I JONES. MCGUIRE. MONNING. STERN. CLOSE ROLE TELL YOU VOTE I SEVEN FIVE ZERO ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY FIVE THE C. ONE THIRTY FEDERAL AIR TANKER [inaudible] TRAINING PLATFORM. THANK YOU CHAIR WHY KELSEY AGAIN TOM PORTER -- CAL FIRE DIRECTOR -- THIS IS ENHANCE FIRE PROTECTION MAY REVISION C. ONE THIRTY AIR TANKERS [inaudible] AND OF CAL FIRE IS TO BE IS REQUESTING FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS -- EIGHT IN NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR OF GENERAL FUND DOLLARS -- AS WELL AS A FOUR POINT SIX IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWO POINT. TWO IN DOLLARS IN [inaudible] TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THIS REQUEST. HI IS FOR A IS TO FIND THE C. ONE THIRTIES -- AS A TRIO EIGHT AC ONE THIRTY AS A TRAINING PLATFORM -- FOR CRUISE BETWEEN THE FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OF THE PILOTS WILL COMPLETE THEIR TRAINING TO FLY THE THE C. ONE THIRTIES THE SEVENTY ONE THIRTY IS THAT -- WE ARE ARE GOING TO START TAKING RECEIPT OF IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'M SORRY -- TO FISCAL YEAR AND PART OF THE ISSUE IS -- WE WE DIDN'T EXPECT THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THIS PERIOD OF TIME WAITING TIME -- WE EXPECTED WE WERE GONNA HAVE THE FIRST ONE READY TO FLY AND NINETEEN TWENTY AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME AND THROUGH THE PROCESS OF OF RECEIVING THOSE THOSE -- AIR TANKERS FROM THE AIRFORCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THEY HAVE TO BE RETROFITTED TO BE ACTUAL AIR TANKERS -- RIGHT NOW THEY ARE THEY DON'T HAVE THE TANK SYSTEM AND THE AND THE RETURN DELIVERY -- CAPABILITY OF AN AIR TANKER SO THAT WILL HAVE TO BE DONE BEFORE WE TAKE RECEIPT OF THOSE -- AND IN THE INTERIM -- WE ARE SHORT AND AIR TANKER THAT WE WERE HOPING TO HAVE -- AS WELL AS WE ARE SHORT PILOTS TO FLY THOSE AIRCRAFT ONCE THEY COME ON LINE IF WE DON'T START TRAINING THEM NOW. SO BETWEEN THOSE -- TWO THOSE TWO NEEDS. WE ARE ASKING AND AND THAT AND THAT'S NEW BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE WOULDN'T BE GETTING THOSE THOSE AIR TANKERS WHEN WE WERE WHEN WE WERE BUILDING OUR BUDGET REQUEST -- LAST FALL FOR THE JANUARY BUDGET. A COUPLE OF OTHER ITEMS -- RELATED TO TO THIS -- WHAT I'LL CALL A LARGER TANKER LATT? WE CAL FIRE DON'T HAVE A LARGE AIR TANKER IN OUR FLEET -- WITHOUT THIS. THIS AIR TANKER -- THE SOME OF THE REASONS THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT GOING INTO -- THIS COMING SEASON -- THE HEAVY GRASS COURT CROP AND THE AS THAT STARTS TO DRY WERE EXPECTING THAT THAT WILL INCREASE FIRE ACTIVITY -- TO AND THEN PASS INTO THOSE -- BRUSH AND TIMBER COVERED LANDSCAPES -- PARTICULARLY IN THE THE THE CENTRAL SIERRA WE HAVE VERY HEAVY LARGE FUELS THAT REQUIRE A HEAVIER LOAD OF AIR TANKER. DROP IN ORDER TO COAT THEM PROPERLY AND AND REDUCE THE SPREAD OF FIRE -- WE DO NOT HAVE A LACK IN OUR ARSENAL OR R. R. TO BAG OF TOOLS WITHOUT THIS WE CAN CALL THEM UP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT OFTEN PARTICULARLY EARLY IN THE SEASON THOSE AIR TANKERS ARE IN OTHER PARTS OF OF THE NATION FIGHTING FIRE. ANOTHER ITEM THAT WE LEARNED -- JUST THIS MORNING ACTUALLY FROM FROM -- ADJUTANT GENERAL BALD ONE IS THAT ONE OF OUR MATHS -- CAPABLE SHIPS AND CREWS OUT OF CHANNEL ISLANDS -- IS. NOT A THEIR OUT OF THE OUT OF COUNTRY ON DEPLOYMENT UNTIL LATE IN THE SEASON END OF AUGUST IT SOUNDS LIKE -- BEFORE THEY WILL BE BACK AND READY TO TRAIN AND GET THAT SHIP READY TO GO. SO WE WILL BE DOWN ONE MASS CAPABLE -- AIRCRAFT IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH MOST OF THIS OF THIS SEASON THAT THAT'S THAT'S BRAND NEW INFORMATION WE JUST FOUND OUT -- TODAY SO. WITH THAT -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TOOL IS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR US THIS SEASON IN PARTICULAR AND UNTIL WE HAVE. THE PILOTS ON OUR OWN C. ONE THIRTIES IN PLACE. IT WILL SAVE LIVES AND PROPERTY. WITH THE NEW CAPABILITY THAT WHAT IT WILL BRING TO US. ON THE PIECE BEFORE WE GET TO THE LA L. THERE'S A PIECE THAT THE TRAINING PIECE AND THEN THERE'S THE MECHANICS TRAINING PIECE OF A FOR LEASING. SOMEBODY ELSE'S AIRPLANE THAT WERE. FOR A YEAR BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE SHORT WE NORMALLY PAY FOR THE TRAINING ON THE MECHANICS. ON THAT I MEAN I I IF THEY WERE OURS I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SAME BUT THE SAD. IS THAT NORMAL. I HAVE DEPUTY DIRECTOR -- TYLER HERE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY APOLOGIES THAT I'VE BEEN COUGHING ALL DAY -- JOE TYLER DEPUTY DIRECTOR CAL FIRE. SO AT THE PRIMARY BENEFIT OF HAVING A TRAINING PLATFORM IS THE ABILITY TO TRAIN -- OUR CURRENT PILOTS AS WELL AS FUTURE PILOTS TO BE ABLE TO FLY THE C. ONE THIRTIES. AS A SECONDARY BENEFIT OF HAVING THAT AIRCRAFT IN PLACE IT ALLOWS THE VENDOR WHO'D BE PROVIDING THE SOLE C. ONE THIRTY WITH THEIR MECHANICS TO TRAIN OUR DYNCORP MECHANICS IN THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. IT IS A SECONDARY BENEFIT AS ANOTHER SECONDARY BENEFIT TO AS DIRECTOR PORTER MENTIONED -- THE SECOND -- RIP BENEFIT PROVIDES -- AN ACTIVE WILDLAND FIRE FIRE FIGHTING C. ONE THIRTY TO THE SYSTEM DROPPING FOUR THOUSAND GALLONS RETARDED COMPARED TO THE EIGHT HUNDRED TO TWELVE HUNDRED GALLONS. ARE AS TO DROP NOW. YEAH I EIGHT I JUST GOT A CONCERN WITH THE PLATFORM I GUESS ON THE OUT YEARS IF YOU THINK YOU NEED THREE YEARS TO TRAIN THE MECHANICS AND THEN YOU'RE DOING IT THIS YEAR WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S ORIGINALLY WAS WE ARE EXPECTING TO DO WITH THIS AND THREE YEARS AND WORD WITH DOWN WITH THAT PORTION. ALEJO YOU HAVE SOME. INCONCLUSIVE -- OBSERVATIONS -- JUST COMPUTERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND JUST TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE OF THE CONTEXT OF THIS PROPOSAL THIS IS IN ADDITION -- TO A JANUARY PER BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WAS HEARD I'M ALMOST TWO MONTHS AGO BY THE COMMITTEE FOR THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS THIRTEEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN. NINETEEN TWENTY INCREASING TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE ON THE SEVEN C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAM SAID THIS WOULD BE THE TRAINING PLATFORM ON TOP OF THAT. JUST TO REMIND YOU OF THAT CONTEXT AND THAT ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE PROPOSAL AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS ASSERTING THAT. THIS AND FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY IS SOMEONE A CAUGHT ABOUT COST NEUTRAL IN THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD VERY LIKELY AND KERR AND THE SAME OR EVEN POTENTIALLY HIGHER COSTS -- TO HAVE A CONTRACT PLANE BROUGHT ON BOARD DURING PEAK FIRE SEASON -- WE DID GET SOME BACK UP DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON THIS ASSERTION AND IT'S SOMEONE INCONCLUSIVE ON IN MANY YEARS IT APPEARS THAT THE AMOUNT THAT WAS SPENT B THE DEPARTMENT ON SORT OF A CALL WE NEED A CONTRACT FOR THE PLANE WOULD BE AVAILABLE ONLY FOR THOSE FIRE. FIGHTING NEEDS ANOTHER TRAINING NEEDS -- IS GENERALLY LESS THAN THE AMOUNT THAT SPENT HERE IN SOME AREAS IT'S IT'S IN THE SAME BALLPARK IN AND IN A FEW INSTANCES IT WAS HIGHER -- AND SO IT'S IT'S NOT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR HOW MUCH SHE WOULD BE SAVED AND THAT'S REALLY ALL GOING TO DEPEND ON AND REALLY WHAT THE FIRE FIGHTING NEEDS ARE -- IN THE UPCOMING FIRE SEASONS OVER THE COURSE OF THIS CONTRACT WHICH NO ONE CAN REALLY PROTECT. ON BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT THAT AND THERE WOULD BE SOME OFFSETTING SAVINGS I AM JUST BASED ON WHAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS INCURRED IN PAST YEARS -- FOR CONTRACTING FOR THIS PEAK SERVICES I'M IN TERMS OF USING THIS AS A TRAINING PLATFORM FOR THAT THE PILOTS AND THE MECHANICS. AND WE JUST THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GONNA WANT TO ALIGN YOUR ACTIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE LARGER SEE WHEN -- THIRTY PROGRAM PROPOSAL AND AND AND WITH ALL OF THOSE ENHANCE FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES IS WEIGHING THAT THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF OF THAT APPROACH THE GOVERNOR'S LAID OUT -- WITH OTHER OPTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AND YOU KNOW IN IN PAST YEARS THE LEGISLATURE'S WANTED. TO PUT MORE INTO AND FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AND AND SO THIS WILL BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS ONE IN THE SAME CONTEXT AS THE THE LARGER PROPOSED. FOR FINANCED. YOU CAME IN IN JANUARY TH WITH THIRTEEN POINT ONE IF THERE'S A CHANGE WHY NOT COME WITH THE PROPOSAL NOW THAT SAYS CAN WE HAVE AUTHORITY BUDGET AUTHORITY TO TO ENTER TO USE SOME OF THIS THIRTEEN POINT. ONE FOUR POINT SIX TO DO THE LEAST DO THE TRAINING AND ALL THAT TYPE OF STUFF AND ON IN THE OUT YEARS ON THE THIRD YEAR COME BACK FOR THE THE FINAL. PURCHASE PRICE OF THE C. ONE THIRTIES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALREADY WELL NONE OF ALREADY RIGHT. YEAH I CAN I CAN SORT OF SEE TO THAT -- I'LL SEND YOU A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WALL AND ESSENTIALLY WE ARE RECEIVING THESE PLANES AND WE ARE PLANNING ON OPERATING THEM SO I THINK IN THAT IN THE ASSUMPTION IN TERMS OF INCLUDING OUT YOUR FUNDING WE'RE NOT. ASSUMING THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE DOING THAT SO WE HAVE BUILT IN THE OUT YOU'RE FINDING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE WILL HAVE THE SEVEN PLANES THAT THAT YOU KNOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO IT TO UTILIZING DEPLOY AS AS I'VE FIRE. FIRES WELFARE ACTIVITY OCCURS I'M IN TERMS OF THE THREE YEARS FOR THIS PARTICULAR EXCLUSIVE USE CONTRACT THAT BATTLE LINES UP WITH SORT OF WHEN THE PLANES ARE GOING TO BE DELIVERED IN THE NUMBER OF PILOTS THAT WERE TRAINING EXCITER US SO. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT'S REASONABLE TO PROVIDE THE THREE YEARS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WILL ULTIMATELY NEED TO TRAIN UP THE TEN PILOTS WALL WERE RECEIVING PLANES MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE READY TO GO INTO OPERATION AND APPOINT THEM [inaudible] CENTER JONES. YOU TELL QUESTIONS -- MAY BE OFF TOPIC ALL OF IT SO MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I GO TOO FAR -- EMAILING BACK. OKAY WELL I WANT TO BE ON THE ON THE TRAINING AND AND SPECIFICALLY THE SEVEN TANKERS -- THAT WERE RECEIVING AT WHAT WHAT'S THE SIZE OF THE FLIGHT CREW ON THOSE PLANES. THE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR IT IS A PILOT COPILOT FLIGHT ENGINEER OKAY IS THAT TRUE ON THE ISSUES NOW. YES TWO FLIES WITH A SINGLE PILOT OKAY SO WE'RE GOING FROM ONE PILOT FOR PLANED THREE PILOTS FOR PLANE SO WE GOT WE HAVE THREE PLANES. HOW MANY CRUZ IS THAT IS THAT FOURTEEN CREWS TWENTY ONE CREWS AT? OF THE SEVEN C. ONE THIRTIES UP FIVE WILL BE IN SERVICE. OF THOSE FIVE VETERANS SERVICE KEEP THEM IN SERVICE. OKAY SIR TO PER PLANE. YES THEY CITY FLIGHT CREWS PARKING PER PLANE AND SO TWENTY PEOPLE. ARE THAN THIRTY PEOPLE. THIRTY PILOTS THAT WERE ARE THOSE. PEOPLE ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA -- ARE WE RECRUITING THOSE THIRTY PEOPLE WEAR THOSE THIRTY PEOPLE COMING FROM. SO IT'LL BE A MIX I CURRENTLY OUR PROPOSED PLAN IS TO TRAIN CURRENT AS TO INITIAL ATTACK RATED PILOTS. TO FLY A C.. ONE THIRTY IN ADDITION TO THAT -- WE'RE HOPING OF THAT WE WILL FIND -- SEE ONE THIRTY PILOTS INTO THE FUTURE. ACCURACY ONE THIRTY PASSES THE RETIRING OR IN THE RESERVES. WITH THEIR FORCES AIRFORCE ONLY ONE THAT FLY SEE ONE THIRTIES RIGHT NOW IT IS A ARMY NAVY FIND. I BELIEVE ALL BRANCHES OF THE MILITARY FLIES SEE ONE THIRTY AT NOT WELL SOME FLY THE H. MODEL THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY ASKING FOR OTHERS ARE CURRENTLY FLYING J. MODEL AND I WOULD ASSUME. AND CORRECT ME IF I'M HOURS FLYING IS C. ONE THIRTY AND FIRE FIGHTING IS DIFFERENT THAN FLYING IS C.. ONE THIRTY IN THE MILITARY. BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A MILITARY EXPERIENCE. I CAN'T I CAN'T ANSWER THAT A PROPERLY OF THE VAN -- FLYING LOW LEVEL FLIGHTS OVER VEGETATION IN FIRE CONDITIONS IS A HIGH RISK -- INITIATIVE SURE GO IT AYE AYE LET ME TO SAVE A COUPLE WORDS FOR JOE'S VOICE. REFER FOR OTHER QUESTIONS -- TOO BUT WHAT WE ALSO ALREADY DO TRAIN WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD A CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD WYOMING -- THE REGULAR AIRFORCE IN COLORADO AND THEN -- WILL WITH A MOVED TO NEVADA BUT ANYWAY THE WHICH WE ALREADY TRAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD TO DO THIS MISSION SO THEY HAVE SEVERAL OF FLIGHT CREWS. THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS TRAINING I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER -- BUT BUT WE DO HAVE THAT CAPABILITY AND OUR EXPECTATION IS AS CAL FIRE HAS THIS -- PERMANENT WORK FORCE. OPPORTUNITY THERE WILL BE -- SOME OF THOSE AIR TANKER PILOTS THAT ARE ALSO MILITARY C. ONE THIRTY PILOTS -- THAT WILL COME INTO OUR OUR PILOT PROGRAM -- CAM I'M IMAGINE SEE ONE THIRTIES OR USE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ALREADY FOR FIRE FIGHTING. HE THREW IT THROUGH -- CONTRACT ONLY THAT WE DON'T THERE AREN'T ANY THAT ARE IN -- GOVERNMENT SERVICE FOR SUCH AS THAT THAT I'M AWARE OF NATIONAL GUARD OKAY FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD YEAH SO WHEN WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE THE THIRTY PEOPLE IENTIFIED IN ON THE PAY ROLL IN. AND FULL TIME WITH CAL FIRE. SO THERE IS A PHASED IN MULTI YOUR APPROACH -- BASED ON A DELIVERY OF THE AIRCRAFT TO TO BRING THEM HOME AND OVER FACE PERIOD OKAY. AND I'LL JUST I'M CLOSE WITH THIS I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS I I YOU KNOW I THINK IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA AND AND FOR CAL FIRE AND YOU pSINGLE ONE OF OUR AREAS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY. OUT OF CONTROL -- FOREST FIRES SO AT AM. REALLY LOOKING FORWARD AND HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT ON THIS AND AS I WAS IN THIS IS THAT ACTION ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO SPEND MONEY ON SO THANK YOU. LEO HOW EXCITED ARE YOUWHAT JUST JUST TO CLARIFY FOR THE COMMITTEE SO THE PILOTS WOULD NOT BE I AM A CAL FIRE EMPLOYEES THIS WOULD BE THROUGH A CONTRACT THAT THEY HAVE. THE PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE SIME AND THE ORIGINAL JANUARY PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE SOME AND CAL FIRE STAFF THAT DAY AND ALL OF THE MINISTRIES AND THAT FLIGHT CREWS WOULD BE THROUGH A CONTRACT AND SO THAT WOULD BE THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THEY WOULD BE IDENTIFYING THE FLIGHT CREWS. JUST MAKE SURE THAT DIDN'T GET LOST IN TRANSLATION I APPRECIATE SO EVEN AFTER CALIFORNIA OWNS THE AIRPLANES AND IS OPERATING THEM FULL TIME. THE PILOTS AND CREWS ILL NOT BE CALIFORNIA BE CALIFORNIA PLEASE AT CREEK CONSISTENT MAR OUR UNDERSTANDING IS X. CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA -- AT LEE AND STOPS ITS FLIGHT CREWS FOR THE EXISTING PLANES THANK YOU. HOW FAR? TO CLARIFY OF JESSICA'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR AIR TANKERS AND MOVIE TEN AIR TACTICAL PLANES -- PILOTS ARE BEING -- UNDER CONTRACT CURRENTLY WITH DYING COR INTERNATIONAL. ALL OF OUR HELICOPTER PILOTS ARE CIVIL SERVICE CLASSIFICATIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A QUICK COMMENT DO APPRECIATE -- THE DIRECTOR BRINGS FORWARD AND STRUCTURE THANK YOU I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS AND I NEVER WANT TO PUT WORDS IN CALIFORNIA'S MATH. BUT WHEN -- OVER THE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE THE FIRES WERE GOING TO SPEND WHAT IT TAKES OR IS. CANDIDLY THERE ISN'T THE BUDGET. I AND WE'RE GONNA SPEND WHAT IT TAKES BEEN PUT IT OUT SO THAT MEANS FOR BRINGING AIR APPARATUS FROM. WESTERN STATES OR FROM AROUND THE UNITED STATES WORKING DOING MARINA SPEND IT -- AND I THINK THAT IT IS BEST TO BE A TO CONTROL OUR OWN DESTINY -- AND BE ABLE TO HAVE THESE -- AT THE READY IN A TARGETED AREA STRATEGIC AREAS ACROSS THE STATE -- SO EVEN THOUGH WE MAY NOT SEE A CUT OF TOTAL COST SAVINGS BECAUSE WE IN PLEASE PUSH BACK IF I'M WRONG ON THIS BUT WE'RE ABLE. TO WE GET SOME REIMBURSEMENT FROM LIKE FOR EXAMPLE -- THE FEDS WERE ABLE TO PUT THAT TOWARDS THE COST OF WE NEEDED FOR RESPONSE. REGARDLESS OF THAT -- BEING ABLE TO MOBILIZE THESE THROUGHOUT STRATEGIC AREAS THIS STATE IS THE RIGHT THING TO BE ABLE TO DO. UNDERSTAND WHERE THE CHAIR ALSO ONCE WE HAVE TO GO WITH JUST. ONE CORRECT BUT BUT ULTIMATELY WE'RE GONNA HAVE SEVEN TO BACK UP FIVE READY TO GO IN STRATEGIC AREAS ACROSS THE STATE -- IN OBVIOUSLY -- WITH THE CHAIRS ALSO BEEN FOCUSES NOT JUST ON SUPPRESSION BUT THEN ALSO ON MAKING SURE THAT WERE ABLE TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF SOME MORE PROACTIVE. MEASURES AS WELL BUT AGAIN. I I SEEN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN ON THE NORTH COAST. NOW I TERRIBLE IT HAS BEEN -- AND THEN HAVING TO BE ABLE TO WAIT BOTH FOR PERSONNEL TO BE A BRIEF FLOWN IN FROM ACROSS THE NATION. AS WELL AS AIR SUPPORT -- IT'S PAST DUE. GLAD THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD ON GETTING RID OF THE VIETNAM THEIR HELICOPTERS IN THIS IS ALSO THE NEXT STEP -- IS WELL SO APPRECIATE. OKAY THIS IS STEP FOR CONDITIONS TO HOLD OPEN -- WILL HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING AT THE END OF THE CAL FIRE -- THE AGENDAS LET'S MOVE ON TO INNOVATION -- PROCUREMENT SPRINT -- ISSUE NUMBER -- TWENTY SIX OKAY. PLEASE INNOVATION PROCUREMENT SPREAD BCP. CALPERS REQUESTING A FIFTEEN POINT. I'M SORRY JUST FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND -- ONE TIME IN. SCHOOL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY TO PROCURE -- INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS. AT A TO COMBAT IT CALVET A CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE -- WILDFIRES UNDER THIS CRISIS THIS THIS IS -- AN ITEM THAT. WAS IDENTIFIED BY. EXECUTIVE ORDER -- AND ZERO FOUR NINETEEN AND A ONE THAT THEY THE GOVERNOR ASKED CAL FIRE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THAT AND GENERAL SERVICES -- TO WORK THROUGH THIS NEW PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING A PROBLEM AND THEN -- WORKING THROUGH AN INNOVATIVE PROCESS TO TO GET IDEAS AND CONCEPTS THAT WOULD THEN TURN INTO -- A DEPLOYMENT SCHEDULE THAT WOULD. LOOK INTO NEXT YEAR AND THE FUTURE -- SO -- WHAT WE'VE DONE -- IS WORKED WITH GOOD COLLABORATE WE WE ARE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH VENDORS AND INNOVATORS. TO OF CONCEPTS DURING THIS -- THIS COMING FIRE SEASON -- WE'RE LOOKING. FOR THE BUDGET REQUESTED PIECE OF THIS IS THE IS FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN STIPENDS FOR VENDORS -- THIS IS TO INCREASE SAY MOM AND POP OR INVADERS THAT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES. TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THOSE REALLY GOOD IDEAS IF THEY COME ABOUT. A AND THEN A REQUEST FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PROOF OF CONCEPT PHASE -- THAT WULD -- THEN PUT US INTO -- EVALUATION OF THOSE CONCEPTS AS THEY ROLL OUT THROUGH THE FIRE SEASON -- THE LET'S SEE THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS THAT THIS -- AGAIN WOULD BE DEPLOYED NEXT FIRE SEASON ON A MORE PERMANENT BASIS BUT CONCEPTS WOULD BE APPROVED THROUGH THIS SEASON AND INTO THE THE WINTER PERIOD. HOWEVER YOU HAS SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THIS BUDGET REQUEST THERE ARE SO AND TYPICALLY EACH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AS YOU KNOW AND THE NORMAL PROCESS WOULD BE FOR A DEPARTMENT. TO EVALUATE ITS SOLUTIONS TO A PROBLEM AND AND AND HAVE A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF WHAT THEY WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON AND THEN BRING THAT REQUEST FOR TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND THROUGH THIS ALTERNATIVE I'M PROCUREMENT PROCESS THAT IS REALLY SORT OF BEING PILOT TESTED HERE AT CAL FIRE -- IT'S KIND OF FLIPPING THINGS I AM IN THE ORDER OF THINGS AND THAT MAKES IT SO MUCH CHALLENGING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE YOUR BEING ASKED TO APPROVE. MONEY TO DO THINGS THAT WILL SOLVE A PROBLEM STATEMENT WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING WHAT EXACTLY AND THOSE THINGS WOULD BE AND EXACTLY HOW THE FUNDS WOULD BE SPENT. I THAT BEING SAID IN OUR OFFICE RECOGNIZES THAT POTENTIAL BENEFITS FROM DOING THINGS IN A DIFFERENT AND MORE CREATIVE WAY AT LEAST PILOT TESTING IT OUT AND SEEING HOW IT GOES AND THIS FIRST YEAR. AND AND SO THE OVERALL CONCEPT AND MAY IS IS SOMEWHAT REASONABLE IN THAT REGARD AND THE LANGUAGE HOWEVER THAT IS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION THE PROVISIONAL BUDGET LANGUAGE -- BUT WE THINK IT DOES NOT REALLY PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND AND ENOUGH AND SORT OF FEEDBACK TO THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE FINDING IS SPENT ON SO AND OUR FIRST CONCERN IS. THAT THE BUDGET LANGUAGE ALLOWS BASICALLY UNLIMITED AUGMENTATIONS THROUGH AND JUST A NOTIFICATION TO THE G. JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. ON IN SOME CASES THAT'S ONLY A FIFTEEN DAY NOTIFICATION WHICH REALLY DOES NOT PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE -- BUT WITH THE VERY MUCH TIME TO CONSIDER WHAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT MID YEAR. ON BUDGETARY AUGMENTATIONS AND AND THEN IT'S ONLY GOING THROUGH JUST THAT MAKE YOUR PROCESS WHERE THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE'S NOT HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY IT'S JUST THROUGH THE JAIL BC. AND THE SECOND CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH THE LANGUAGE IS THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE FOR A WAY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE KEPT UPDATED AND APPRISED ON THE PROGRESS. OF THIS INNOVATIVE PROCUREMENT APPROACH SO WHAT WE ASK HOW FIRE ON THE TYPES AS I AM RESPONSES THAT THEY'VE RECEIVED SINCE THEY'VE I AM HER IN THE EVALUATION ROCESS NOW THEY RECEIVED RESPONSES BACK. I HAVEN'T THE ANSWER THAT WE GUIDE AND IS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT REALLY ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING THERE UNDER A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE. TO I AM A SHARE INFORMATION ON AND I'M REALLY IN THE NUMBER OF RESPONSES THAT THEY'VE RECEIVED THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS ARE SOLUTIONS THAT THEY'RE EVALUATING. AND TO REALLY GET THE LEGISLATURE A SENSE OF WHAT MIGHT YOU BE BUYING FOR THIS FIFTEEN MILLION ARE FIFTEEN MILLION CLASS AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND -- IF YOU WANT TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS I AM REVISING OF THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT BACK ONCE THEY'RE DONE WITH THE EVALUATION AND FEES OF AND THE INITIAL PART BEFORE THEY START SPENDING MONEY BEFORE THEY'RE PUTTING I'M FUNDING INTO ANY OF THESE PROTOTYPES. SO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE KNOW WHAT DID THEY FIND WHAT TYPES OF SOLUTIONS WERE PROPOSED AND WHICH ONES DO THEY WANT TO GO FORWARD WITH -- AND THEN ALSO COMING BACK AND BEFORE FINDING A SPENT AND AND AND PUTING A CAP ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT. OF MAYBE MAKES SENSE TO GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IF IT'S STILL SORT OF AND CLEAR WHAT TYPES OF SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE I'M. PILOT TESTED THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND AND HOW MUCH THAT MIGHT COST THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUNDING -- BUT WE THINK YOU WOULD WANT TO CAP IT SAYS THAT YOU AT LEAST HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE BUDGETARY COMMITMENT IS ON THIS. IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH AT LEAST PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE OUTCOMES OF THESE TESTS I MEAN I GET THAT THE FACT THAT SOME OF THIS IS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR MIGHT BE IN THIS IS THESE ARE. THESE YOUR MOM AND POP OPERATIONS ARE COMING UP WITH THESE INNOVATIVE IDEAS BUT AT LEAST LET US KNOW ONCE YOU TESTED IT OUT THERE IN THE WE WE OR WHEREVER YOU'RE TESTING IT WHAT THE OUTCOMES WOULD BE. FINANCE OR NO LET'S GO CAL FIRE. I GET TO FINANCE. SORRY. TOMORROW'S GOING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION WELL CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS TOMORROW I'M SHOWING THE CALVARY DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND WITHIN PARTNERING WITH -- CAL FIRE ON THIS THE PROCUREMENT OF VERY ACTIVELY AND SO CENTER WITH OUR PRACTICE OF AND POLICIES THAT WE DO NOT RELEASE INFORMATION DURING AN ACTIVE PROCUREMENT WE ARE LEVERAGING A MODEL ALLOWS US TO NEGOTIATE -- WITH -- BIDDERS AND AND INNOVATORS DURING THIS PROCESS AND SO WE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO REVIEW CERTAIN RESULTS OF THE VARIOUS PROTOTYPES IN AS WE PROGRESS BOARD WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO THE NEGOTIATE WITH OTHER -- INNOVATORS DEPENDING UPON THE OUTCOME OF THOSE PREFERRED CONCEPT -- DEPEND UPON THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS WE LIKE TO RESERVE ON THE ABILITY. TO SHARE OR EXPOSE THE INNOVATORS UNTIL THE VERY LAST -- PARTICULAR MOMENT THE PROCESS. BUT NORMALLY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE TECHNOLOGY GUYS I I REPRESENT PART OF SAN JOSE IN THAT AREA I KNOW THAT CROWD THIS IS. FIELD TESTED STUFF ON THE WILDFIRES THERE'S THERE'S GOT I MEAN I GET I GET THAT THEY MAY HAVE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION BUT AT LEAST IF THEY'RE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY. AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF THIS IF -- WE'RE LOOKING AT THE OUTCOME I DON'T WANNA KNOW HOW THE GADGET WORKS I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT IT WORKS. YEAH I KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT'S INCLUDED THAT PROVIDES THE NOTIFICATIONS IN THE CASE OF THE STIPENDS THERE'S A THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION IN THE CASE OF THE ACTUAL PROCUREMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY THERE'S A FIFTEEN DAY NOTIFICATION THOSE TIME LINES WERE DELIBERATELY CONSTRUCTED BECAUSE THE ENTIRE. INTENT HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE SOLUTIONS ON THE GROUND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND SO THIS IS. A TO THIS WHOLE PROCESS IN THE INTENSE AND THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE TIME LINES INTO AND IF THERE ARE DELAYS IN THAT IT JUST PUTS US BACK BECAUSE THE WHOLE GOAL HERE IS TO GET THE SOLUTIONS ON THE GROUND IN TIME FOR NEXT FIRE SEASON AND I'M JUST ASKING. THAT YOU SHARE WITH THE LEGISLATOR OF THE LEGISLATURE A LITTLE BIT AT THE OUTCOME SINCE THERE IS NO CAP ON THIS THE LA -- CAUGHT THIS IS SAYING THERE'S NO CAP ON YOUR PROPOSALS ACTUALLY I THINK THE INTENT IS TO BRING FOR THAT INFORMATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE I'M AT THE POINT IN TIME AND AND SO THE THERE ARE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS TO ALLOW THAT AND TO AND TO ALLOW FOR THAT ENGAGEMENTS RIGHT FOR THE LETTER. TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND A FIFTEEN DAY TURNAROUND DOESN. IS IT THAT'S THAT. TECHNICALLY MEETS A LEVEL OF NOTICE AND AND FOR THE I. T. PEOPLE THAT MAY BE. THE CAT'S MEOW IS FAR IS NOT LETTING US KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AT ON THE OUTCOMES OF THESE pOF FOR ALL. ALLOCATING MONEY TO KNOW. YES WE'RE GONNA TRY SOMETHING INNOVATIVE WE'RE GONNA GIVE SOME MONEY OUT WITH THAT TRY OUT SOME STUFF BUT JUST. WE'LL SEND YOU A LETTER IN FIFTEEN DAYS YOU DON'T CRY IT AND WE KEEP GOING. THAT'S A CONCERN. CENTER MONEY YOU HAVE A QUESTION. YOU WELL RELATED TO THIS SO I ASSUME. REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS GO OUT. FOR PEOPLE TO BID TO TO BE CONSIDERED. AS ONE OF THE VENDORS FOR THIS INNOVATION IT'S A TWO STAGE PROCUREMENT PROCESS IS LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT -- IN TERMS OF HOW IT IS EXECUTED BUT AFTER WE GO OUT WITH THE AFTER WE COMPLETE THE PROCONSUL. THE INNOVATORS THAT WERE CHOSEN FOR THAT PERFECT CONCEPT ARE THE INNOVATORS THAT CAN COMPETE ON IN THE FINAL STAGES FOR CONTRACT AWARDS SOON INVITING PROPOSALS HAD A YOU. FRAME THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE SEEKING PROPOSALS ABOUT. SURE WE ACTUALLY ISSUED -- THE WHAT WE WORK WERE CALLING THE REQUEST -- FOR INNOVATIVE IDEAS -- ON MARCH TWENTY SECOND. ON SKIS ME ON MARCH TWENTY SECOND AND SO THAT WOULD -- THAT WAS THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE INNOVATORS COULD SUBMIT THEIR IDEAS -- FOR EVALUATION OF BY CAL FIRE AND SO THAT IS THE FIRST STAGE OF THE PROCUREMENT AND WHICH REALLY QUITE FIGURE REPLACES THE R. P. I'M PROCESS THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL OUR INSTITUTIONAL. FIRE CENTERS ABLE TO ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IF THE PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATORS FROM ANY -- SECTOR OR OR AREA OF THE OF THE STATE -- ARE YOU FROM AN ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS OF LOOSELY FOR EXAMPLE. DO WE GIVE PRIORITY TO A CALIFORNIA BASED VERSES OUT OF STATE. NOT AT THIS POINT. AND I I REALIZE WERE MAYBE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT IN TERMS OF OPEN COMPETITION BUT IN IS. IS THERE ANY. WHEN THAT PROCESS TO IDENTIFY? A SMALLER BUSINESS OWNERS MINORITY BUSINESS OWNERS ABSOLUTELY YES THE PROCUREMENT PROCESSES DO ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY. ON SMALL BUSINESS AND DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE SIX BETTER INTERNET PROCESS YES. THANK YOU. HAITIAN THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING WITH THE FIVE MILLION STIPEND THAT PORTION OF IT IS THAT YOU SORT OF IT'S A FIX UNIVERSE OUT THERE WITH THESE CLEVER IDEAS AND THE LEASE IN THIS. THE FIRE. FIGHTING OUT WORLD OKAY THIS IS THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD OPEN MAYBE WE'LL DO SOME WORD SMITHING ANDREA. ACTUAL REQUEST -- AND LET'S MOVE ON THE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN THIS IS THE COMMUNITY -- WILD FIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION REPORT. THE VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM. WELCOME BACK PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. WELCOME BACK -- MATTIAS. JEREMIH CASSIE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT TIAS BORDER FORCING FIRE PROTECTION -- THE MATTER BEFORE YOU FOR CONSIDERATION AT THIS TIME IS A ALLOCATION TO SUPPORT FINAL PREPARATION AUTUMN AND CERTIFICATION OF THE CALIFORNIA VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM E. I. R. -- THIS IS A SOMEONE OF A LONGER PROCESS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH ITS BEEN VERY TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING IT'S A SINGLE PROCESS IT'S COVERING TWENTY POINT. THREE MILLION ACRES WAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ALSO BE TRYING. TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES NAMELY ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION -- WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE TREATMENTS AS WELL AS FUEL BRAKES -- IT'S A KEY KEY PS I BELIEVE AND I BELIEVE MANY DO BELIEVE -- AS WELL IN DISEASE AND MOVING FORWARD AND TRYING TO INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES FOR WILDLAND FIRE PREVENTION WAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S A PROGRAMMATIC E. I. R.. THAT'S COVERING TWENTY THREE TWENTY POINT THREE MILLION ACRES THAT IS CORRECT. SO WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE E. R. IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS THE WORK PROGRAM GO AHEAD YEAH I WOULD LOVE SOME MORE INSIGHT INTO THIS BEEN OVER A DECADE IN THE MAKING HERE -- REPORTER WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR JUST THE UNIQUE. NATURE OF CHAPARRAL VERSES BIG TREE COUNTRY. THE FIRST FEW MITIGATION PLAN THAT CAME OUT. I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FORMULA BEING USED THEIR BEING TO CENTRIC AROUND. TREES AND NOT ENOUGH ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND COMMUNITIES IN SORT OF HITTING THAT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE POSSIBLE BUT I WANT TO GET A SENSE. A HAVE THE TEARING MIGHT WORK ON OTHER PROGRAMMATIC YEAH ARE LIKE HOW HOW TO FIND ARE WE GOING TO BE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THEN IS THERE. ARE YOU ALL SECONDARILY ARE YOU. ARE THERE OTHER PLANS GOING ON BESIDES SORT OF PRESCRIBED FIRE APPROACH TO CHAPARRAL THAT YOU ANTICIPATE DEPLOYING IN THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA SO I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WANNA TAKE THE ORDER OF I TAKE THE FIRST QUESTION. REPORTER IN TERMS OF HEARING ARE THERE'S A CHECKLIST IS GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN I JUST AS A STEP BACK FOR ONE SECOND IN TERMS OF TEARING PART OF THE REASON WHY THEY SAID -- THIS ISSUE WAS TAKEN SUCH A LONG PERIOD OF TIME -- TO TO MOVE FORWARD IS THAT IT IS VERY TECHNICAL THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT HABITATS THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE HABITATS OF VEGETATION TYPES ACROSS TWENTY POINT. TWENTY MILLION ACRES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THERE IS A CHECKLIST AND ALSO ME IS GOING TO BE INCLUDED THAT A PROJECT PROPONENT LIKE CAL FIRE. WHO WOULD BE THE PROPER PRIMARY PROJECT FOR BONE ABOARD BUT IS BEING SET UP IN A MANNER WHERE A MYRIAD OF STAKEHOLDERS WE ALREADY USE THAT WOULD BE ON A POLE THAT CHECKLIST OUT? LOOK TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN PROVIDED AND DETERMINE IF THE PROJECT FALLS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS PROVIDED. YOU WOULD LITERALLY GO THROUGH AND AND LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL RESOURCE SUBJECT MATTER FROM AIR QUALITY TO INDIVIDUAL SPECIES -- TO AESTHETICS AND BE ABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT YOU DO OR DO NOT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM YEAH I ARE. FOR THEIR PROJECTS BEING ANTICIPATED IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION THAT [inaudible] WOULD. TRY TO DID YOU TRY TO USE THIS TEARING FOR OR IS IT ALL SORT OF MOVING ON TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER RIGHT NOW IN THE SEQUEL -- WAIVER THERE'S PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD FALL FROM THE NORTH FROM THE OREGON BORDER TO THE MEXICAN BORDER THAT WOULD FALL WITHIN THIS. YET I I'D LIKE TO ADD A LITTLE BIT TO THAT SO THE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS THAT ARE. UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER -- FOR FIVE NINETEEN THAT IS -- THOSE ARE PARTICULARLY RELATED TO EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE DETERMINED UNDER THAT FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT. AND AND THEN -- WERE WE WERE ORDERED TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THOSE UNDER EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES. SO THOSE ALL NEEDED SOME EXEMPTION FROM C. C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; ALL&lt;/c&gt;</u> TOGETHER -- WE STILL ARE DOING THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND DO AND PRESENTING THAT INTERNALLY WE ARE DOING THE PUBLIC FACING PART OF THAT -- AND SO SO WE STILL ARE DOING THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND AND MAKING SURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE PROTECTED FOR THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS. BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS FROM THOSE THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS ARE ONES THAT WE WOULD DEEM TO BE NEED TO DO THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO DO THEM THIS YEAR. THE THIS IS THE BRIDGE OR THAT'S THE BRIDGE TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE FOR THIS OF CALVI T. P. THE CALIFORNIA VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAMMATIC HE I ARE. ALL OF THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE WILL BE FOLDED UNDER THAT DOCUMENT AND IN FACT THESE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE DOING. AS THEY COME UP FOR RENEWAL THE THE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS THEY'LL HAVE TO FALL UNDER THIS DOCUMENT AS WELL THIS DOCUMENT IS. THE CORNERSTONE OF OF DOING OUR VEGETATION TREATMENT IN THE FUTURE UNDERSTOOD SIR DO YOU ANTICIPATE. USING PRESCRIBED FIRE MORE THAN THIS SORT OF THE SCIENCE BASE BURN CYCLES THE SORT OF NATURAL BURN CYCLES IN THE CHAPARRAL ARE YOU ANTICIPATING DOING MORE PRESCRIBED FIRE THAN THAT IN THE CHAPARRAL. GREAT QUESTION -- AND KNOW WHAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR IS RETURNING -- TO WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRE RETURN THAT THAT'S SCIENTIFICALLY BASED FIRE RETURN -- INTERVALS THAT OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE -- THERE ARE AREAS THAT WE WOULD ALSO BE USING THIS FOR FUEL REDUCTION FOR COMMUNITY PROTECTION IN SOME CASES FOR PROTECTION OF WATERSHED IN OTHER CASES FOR PROTECTION OF ENDANGERED SPECIES. SO WE CAN ACTUALLY USE FUEL REDUCTION. TO TRY AND KEEP FIRE OUT OF AREAS WE DON'T WANT TO BURN ANY MORE FREQUENTLY AS WELL. SO I'M HERE IN A FIRM COMMITMENT NOT TO EXCEED SCIENCE BASED FIRE INTERVALS GOING FORWARD SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN THE CURRENT. TAKE THE EXPEDITE THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND AND IN FACT. SB NINE A ONE AND A TWELVE SIXTY POINT TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T -- CONVERT -- FROM. A CHAPARRAL LANDSCAPE TO A NON CHAPARRAL LANDSCAPE YOU GOT I MEAN YOU HIT ON THE HEAD LOOK AT LOOK AT A MUSTARD THAT'S TEN FEET HIGH. ALL THROUGH THE BURNS AND WE'LL SEE AND IT'S A BEAST I MEAN WE HAVE NO IDEA I MEAN I I DON'T I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM SINGLE PERSON WHAT TO DO WITH IT I MEAN YOU KNOW. YOU TRY TO FIND FUEL BREAKS MAYBE MAYBE WERE THE YOU KNOW I MEAN WE CAN'T EVEN PUT. YOU KNOW A PRESCRIBED FIRE CAN BE TRICKY IN THOSE AREAS BECAUSE IT'S SO SENSITIVE ANY AND ANY INITIAL THING I KNOW A LOT OF THIS IS KIND OUTSIDE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AREA BUT MEAN WERE. WE FEEL AT A LOSS FOR SOLUTIONS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT IS. YEAH SO IT REALLY JUST RELATED TO SOME KIND OF THIS THE CHAPARRAL LANDSCAPE -- FUEL BREAK STILL DO WORK -- THEY WORK IN EVERY LANDSCAPE -- THE CRANSTON FIRE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHERE THIS DOCUMENT IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE USED TO MAINTAIN THAT FUEL BREAK AROUND THE THE THE THE COMMUNITY OF IDYLLWILD -- WHICH IS A CHAPARRAL LANDSCAPE THAT THEN TURNS INTO A PINE FOREST A LITTLE BIT ABOVE. AND THE FIRE HIT THE GRANTS AND FIRE HIT THAT RENT RIPPED UP BE CANYON HIT THAT AT A GLANCING ANGLE. AND WAS DIRECTED AROUND IDYLLWILD IDYLLWILD COULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE PORTIONS OF OF PARADISE OR COFFEE PARK -- EASILY LAST SUMMER AND IT DIDN'T BECAUSE WE HAD A FUEL BREAK IN THE RIGHT PLACE. SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT I FORGET HOW MANY YEAR PROJECTS ON YOUR LIST AT THIRTY FIVE OR IN CHAPARRAL AREAS. ARE THOSE THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT YOU'RE IT IS A MORE FUEL BREAK ORIENTED LESS PRESCRIBED FIRE ORIENTED WOULD YOU SAY ON THE WHOLE. IT IS IT IS FOR THESE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS AND EVEN GOING FORWARD SIR TO OPEN TO THAT STRATEGY JUST. ALL WE HEAR IS THAT EVERY THEY'RE JUST GOING TO ALL IT'S GOING TO BE AS PRESCRIBED FIRE ALL THE TIME AND AND WE SAW JUST. WHAT COMES BACK IS INVASIVE SPECIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WHAT I'M HEARING THAT'S NOT THE WHICH WOULD NOT BE IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL BECAUSE THAT'S AN EMERGENCY EXEMPTION FOR THE IDEA UNDER? COMPLETING THIS E. IR WORK WOULD ALLOW THOSE UNDER THIS PROGRAMMATIC ER. TO THE PROPOSAL'S WHATEVER IT IT'S CAL FIRE OR COUNTY OR RIVERS COULD COME IN WOULD HAVE TO MEET THOSE UNLESS THEY DECIDED THAT THEY WERE ALL OUTSIDE THAT PROGRAM AND THEN THEY WOULD DO. ADDITIONAL E. I. R. TO JUSTIFY WHATEVER THAT WHATEVER THAT ACTION WAS GOING TO BE WHETHER IT WAS A PRESCRIBED BURN OR A CHAPARRAL REMOVAL OR SOMETHING ELSE MY RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU. ARE YOU OKAY WITH MOVING FORWARD. THE COMMOTION. OKAY. THERE IS A SEPARATE CONDITION IS TO PROVE AS A PROPOSED. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION ON THAT ALLEY -- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING. THAT YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH FACE I'M JUST NOTE THAT THIS WILL HOPEFULLY TAKE THIS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE AND THEY EMISSIONS INDICATED THAT THAT THE AIR SHOULD BE COMPLETED DECEMBER IF THIS YEAR AND SO LOOK FOR TO THAT HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL HERE IN SEPT. TWO LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY SEVEN THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO COMPLETE THE VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING THERE IS A MOTION BY. THE NORTH COAST SENATOR MCGUIRE. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I CASKEY I JONES [inaudible] REQUIRED [inaudible] MONNING [inaudible] STERN. I THE MATTERS APPROVED -- FIVE ZERO LET'S MOVE ON TO THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. AND THIS IS. THIS IS THE FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY DIVISION. EIGHTY POST. A NEW FEE STRUCTURE. THIS WOULD HAVE ON A FIRE ENGINE AND PLEASE GO AHEAD -- S. -- ISSUE TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY EIGHT WE HAVE THAT AS THE LICENSING -- AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM YES RIGHT. ISSUE TWENTY YES RIGHT THE THE THIRD IS AT TWENTY EIGHT EIGHT THE LIFE SAFETY DIVISION. OKAY SO TWENTY EIGHT FIRE LIFE SAFETY. THAT THE NUMBERS MIXED UP -- TO CAL FIRES REQUESTING TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. IN FUNDS. THE IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR EIGHT POSITIONS -- TO SUPPORT THE OFFICES STATE FIRE MARSHAL -- LIFE AND FIRE LIFE SAFETY DIVISION INCREASING WORKLOAD RELATED TO IT'S A REVIEW OF PLANS CONSTRUCTION INSPECTIONS AND MANDATED INTERVAL INSPECTION ACTIVITIES. THIS REQUEST INCLUDES -- FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS -- A ONE TIME GENERAL FUNDS -- FOR THE THE FOR AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIVISIONS FEE STRUCTURE AND CONSTRUCT AND CONTRACT WITH THE THE CAL CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE -- TO ANALYZE AND PROVIDE CLEAR THE SPECIFICATIONS STATURE. SPECIFIC STATUTORY ISSUES RELATED TO AND HIM THE IMPACT. TO THE FIRE MARSHAL'S JURISDICTION. SORRY ABOUT THAT. WHEN COMPLETE THE ANALYSIS WILL INFORM THE WORKLOAD -- AND DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY NEEDED FOR THE FIRE MARSHAL. GOVERNOR'S REQUESTING A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO HELP TO FROM A DEFINE. AND CLARIFY THE DIVISIONS MISSION AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS ENTIRE REQUEST COMES. OUT OF IN A COLLABORATION WITH THE MISSION BASED BUDGETING PROCESS -- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT IS ON GOING. THERE'S A THE QUESTIONS RAISED IN THE STAFF REPORT THAT BAD THE WHEN YOU'RE. AS YOU RE DOING YOUR MISSION BASE -- REVIEW PROCESS WE'RE MAKING THESE CHANGES AS W'RE GOING THROUGH WHEN WE WANT TO WAIT FOR THE THE FINAL ANSWER. A FAILING PARKER BERMAN FINANCE -- SO THIS REALLY. REFLECTS THE CULMINATION OF OUR REVIEW OF THE FIRE LIFE SAFETY DIVISION OUR APPROACH WITH -- THIS MISSION BASED REVIEW OF OFFICE THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL HAS BEEN A DIVISION BY DIVISION APPROACH -- BASED PRIMARILY ON THE FACT THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THESE DIVISIONS IN TERMS OF THEIR SCOPE READER AT NOW -- SO -- THIS FOLLOWS THE PROPOSAL FROM LAST YEAR -- AND THIS REALLY REFLECTS THE CULMINATION OF OF THAT REVIEW OF THAT DIVISION. I'M TO THE POINT OF THE ONGOING REVIEW -- WE WILL BE MOVING ON TO OTHER DIVISIONS AND I'VE ALREADY STARTED SOME OF THAT WORK -- SO YEAH I HOPE THAT ADDRESSES YOUR CONCERNS I WILL HELP US OUT HERE WE GOT TO THEIR RE DOING THEIR MISSION. BASED REVIEW PROCESS WITH FINANCE WE GOT THIS. SEGREGATED DIVISIONS THAT DON'T OVER OVERLAP IN WE WANT EIGHT POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE WORKLOAD BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO INCREASE. FIRST SO AND WE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE PROPOSAL AND IT IT SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT THE POSITIONS ADAM IS THAT WHAT'S PROPOSED HERE DID SEEM. TO BE KIND OF MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND MAYBE ADDRESSING ISSUES THAT WE SORT OF ANECDOTALLY HEARD OVER THE YEARS I'M A REGARDING THAT THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. AND THAT BEING SAID AND THERE ISN'T THIS COMING ANIME REVISION ISN'T A WHOLE LOT OF TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY DIG INTO ISSUES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF BASS CORPS PROGRAM CHANGES. AND AND AND IN THE PAST NGUYEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS DÃ¢N. MAYBE NOT CALLED MISSION BASED REVIEWS BUT PERFORMANCE SPACE REVIEWS OR OTHER THINGS THERE'S OFTEN BEEN SOME SORT OF I'M REPORT THAT KIND USUALLY IN THE FORM OF A OF A SORT OF A ROBUST B. C. P. THAT WOULD COME TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND DESCRIBING WHAT WHAT WAS DIANNE AND THE FINDINGS AND THEN ANY CHANGES THAT MIGHT BE PROPOSED FROM THERE AND SO THIS IS SORT OF A PIECEMEAL APPROACH AND CERTAINLY IT'S NOT AND REASONABLE IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL. THE WHOLE MISSION BASED REVIEW IS COMPLETE AND YOU HAVE A MORE OF A FORMAL AND COMPLETE WORK REPORT BACK. AND THAT YOUR STAFF IS AND RECOMMENDING HERE TO REJECT THE PROPOSAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE JUST DUE TO THE I'M SORT OF THE INTERIM NATURE AS OF THIS TIME AND AGAIN JUST COMING IN MAY IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO DO AGAIN IF YOU HAVE OTHER CONCERNS. ABOUT THE COR I'M PROGRAM AND WITHIN THE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE AT THE RESOURCES DID SEEM REASONABLE TO US IN A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ON THAT ALSO PERHAPS NOT TERRIBLY URGENT AND AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU WANT MORE TIME TO LOOK AT THIS AND MAYBE DAY AGAIN. TO AND THESE THESE BASED PROGRAM CHANGES WITHIN THE FIRE MARSHAL AND GIVE IT GIVE IT DO TIME AND ATTENTION -- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT. AS I'M UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS WITHIN FIRE MARSHALS PROGRAM -- THE SEPARATING ARE CLARIFYING THAT DID THE MISSION AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES. HOW THE SAID HELP OUT? THERE'S JUST A CHARGER I GUESS THERE'S BEEN SOME ROLE IN -- AREAS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED DO A EXTENSIVE STASHED TRUE REVIEW IN COLLABORATION WITH THE OFFICE THAT -- HAVE. KIND OF BEEN GRAY AREAS IF YOU WILL -- IN TERMS OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES -- BETWEEN LOCALS AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND THE FOR THE AND THE STATE -- SO REALLY -- THIS ATTEMPT IS TO CLARIFY AND STREAMLINE AND AND REALLY SET THE SET THE BOUNDARIES -- YOU KNOW MORE -- YEAH MORE STRONGLY AND ALSO -- TO YOU KNOW ELIMINATE ANY DUPLICATIVE WORKLOAD THAT MAY BE -- GOING ON BETWEEN -- THE OFFICES THE FARMERS AND SOME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. WITHIN EVERYTHING THAT THE STATE MARK FIRE MARSHAL DOES OR JUST WITHIN THE WITH LIFE AND SAFETY DO WITHIN THE FIRE LIFE SAFETY DIVISION SO HOW DOES THAT HELP US OUT ON THE WHOLE FIRE MARSHAL. STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE WITH THERE MAY BE. WE GOT ISSUE TWENTY NINE COMING UP DUPLICATIVE OR PERCEPTIONS OF DUPLICATIVE ACTIVITY GOING ON WITH THE CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT THE COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. AGAIN THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY LOOKING AT THIS DIVISION -- WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY ANY AREAS WHERE -- OTHER DIVISIONS WITHIN THE FIRE MARSHAL REALLY OVERLAP WITH THE PHARMACY DIVISION THEY HAVE A VERY UNIQUE -- AND TO FIND -- MISSION -- AND THIS OF THE OF THIS KIND OF IS THE REASON THAT WE HAVE TAKEN THIS APPROACH -- AND LOOKING AT THIS -- DIVISION I WILL JUST ALSO ADD THAT -- WE WOULD REALLY EMPHASIZE THAT IN YOU KNOW IN OUR ESTIMATION THESE ARE THESE RECESSES THESE RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY VERY CRITICAL FOR THE STATE RIGHT NOW IN THIS PROPOSAL REFLECTS -- AN EXTENSIVE -- REVIEW AND AND DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS -- BOTH YOU KNOW STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AND OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS -- YOU'RE RELATED TO THE WORK OF THE FIREPLACE A DIVISION IN TERMS OF AVOIDING PROJECT DELAYS AND AT YOU KNOW AND COST OVERRUNS -- SO THIS IS IN OUR INTERVIEW VERY CRITICAL -- RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THE DIVISION PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA TO INVITE THE LA -- ON THOSE ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS WE WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT RIGHT IN A WEEK WITH LEAST KEPT ON IF THIS IS THE WAY WITH THE REORGANIZATIONS GOING IN AND WE'RE GONNA AGAIN. IT'S MAY FIFTEENTH WHATEVER DAY IT IS. MAY FOURTEENTH. MAY TWELFTH MAY FIFTEENTH ELLIE -- YOU HAVE. CAN BE HELPFUL HERE. YEAH I I THINK AND YOU KNOW AGAIN THE THE THE RESOURCES PROPOSED I'M TO TAKE ON THE STAFF SIDE IT'S NOT AN UNREASONABLE STEP FORWARD AND A YOU KNOW THESE MISSION BASED REVIEWS AND WHEN THIS REPORTED BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IS A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU -- TODAY AGAIN DO OVERSIGHT UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAMS I AM YOU MIGHT THINK THAT YOU YOU KNOW NEED TO GO FURTHER THAN WHERE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ON THE AND A DEPARTMENT LAND IN TERMS OF THEIR AND YOU KNOW FINDINGS AND THEIR RECOMMENDED CHANGES I'M AND SO WHERE YOU'RE REALLY TALKING. ABOUT -- WITH THESE MISSION BASE REVIEWS SORT OF FUNDAMENTAL BASE PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES -- WHICH DOESN'T SEEM TO BE -- PARTICULARLY URGENT AND AND SO WHILE IT DOES SEEM REASONABLE IT'S ALSO REASONABLE IF THE LEGISLATURE HAVING NOT BEEN PART OF THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WITH YOUR STAFF FOR WITH OUR OFFICE. I'M YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT MORE TIME TO LOOK INTO IT THAT'S ALSO TOTALLY REASONABLE AND AND CAN REALLY. PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT IN THE FUTURE. JUST TO SIT AT THE MISSION BEACH REVIEW PROCESS IS NOT JUST A CRANE FOR THE OFFICE THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL IT'S A CRANE FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUE CAN SHARE MORE DETAIL BUT WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING REGULAR UPDATES TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WHEN WE INITIATED THE PROCESS. WE ALSO INVITED I'M BOTH THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS WELL AS A I COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF MORE BROADLY TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THE GOAL WAS TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE PROCESS. AND SORT OF THE THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES WE WOULD UNDERTAKEN TRYING TO IDENTIFY -- SORT OF WHERE WE WANTED TO FOCUS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE MADE CHANGES ETCETERA SO YOU JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THE GOAL WAS ALWAYS TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS PROCESS AND PUT FOR IT AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE ON OUR FINDINGS. AND THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN B. C. P. TO BE SUPERIOR BROUGHT FORWARD LAST YEAR IDENTIFIED THREE VERY SPECIFIC AREAS OF FOLLOW UP WHICH INCLUDED A STATUTORY REVIEW -- AS WELL AS I'M SOME SOME OTHER ASPECTS AND THE READ THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS PROPOSAL CLEAVE VERY MUCH OR OR A LINE VERY MUCH WITH THOSE SORT OF THREE OUTSTANDING AREAS THAT WE IDENTIFIED. ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE THE FINALLY SAFETY DIVISION HAS THIS ROLE AS AS AS YOU MAY ALREADY BE AWARE IN IN SORT OF THE STATE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING -- TO TO ACCOMPLISH IN THIS PROPOSAL IS IS IMPROVE SORT OF THE PLAN REVIEW ACTIVITIES WHEN PLANS FOR A AND C. CONSTRUCTION ARE COMING TO THE APP FAIRLY SAFETY DIVISION AND MORE WE'RE GOING TO ADD SOME TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND BUILD UP CAPACITY THERE SO THAT. THAT WILL FACILITATE SORT OF SOME OF THE DELAYS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY STAKEHOLDERS OVERTIME AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. YOUR WORK OWSKI. MIKE RICH WINE ACTING STATE FIRE MARSHAL. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CONCUR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND IN THEIR OPINION OF THE CRITICALITY OF THESE RESOURCES. OTHER A HUGE COMPLEX A CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS JUST LOOK AT THE CRANES IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO HERE THOSE ARE STATE BUILDINGS ARE GOING UP HIGH RISE BUILDINGS. AND WE ARE -- AT A CRITICAL NEED -- FOR PLAN REVIEW AND INSPECTION SERVICES THAT CAN COME IN AND HIT THE GROUND RUNNING THAT HAVE THE EXPERTISE. A WE'VE BEEN HAVING DIFFICULTY IN RECRUITING THAT AND WE THINK THIS IS THE BEST PATH FORWARD. YEAH EIGHT I GUESS ONE THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS THAT. MY DISTRICT OFFICES IN A COMMERCIAL BUILDING. AND JOHN DUTRA WHO COLLECTED NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT MOVED INTO THAT BUILDINGS SO TECHNICALLY THE STATE MORE FIRE MARSHAL IS SUPPOSED TO INSPECT THAT BUILDING. EVERY YEAR -- BECAUSE IT'S THE STATE IS THE STATE OFFICE THE CIVIC FREMONT MOTORS FOR CITY THANK THE SEVENTEEN SIXTEENTH LARGEST THE STATE THEY INSPECTED IN THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA INSPECTS IT. SO WHAT WOULD. WHY? I MEAN OTHER THAN OTHER THAN IT'S A STATE WHERE YOU'RE STATE OFFICE WHY WOULD WE HAVE EVERYBODY INSPECTING IT WHEN THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED WHEN THEY DID SOME UPGRADES IN THE BATHROOM WHICH IS FINE BUT GENERALLY IT'S THE SAME. BUILDING. AND WE HAVE A PHYSICAL INSPECTION. ARE THAT IN THAT WOULD HAVE EIGHT MORE PEOPLE AND MAYBE. TO TO DO THAT AND AND AND IT SOUNDS IN THE IN THE ABSTRACT YES THIS IS THE BUILDING WE WANT TO DO THIS BUT BUT SOME OF THESE THINGS WE JUST SORT OF DONE HIM. FOR EVER AND WE CONTINUE TO DO IT AND PEOPLE ALWAYS ASKING US TO GET. YOU KNOW -- STREAMLINED WORD IS -- CUT AWAY WOULD DUPLICATE DUPLICATIONS SO DO JUST THAT -- ONE OF OUR TRAILER BILL. LOW'S IS ESSENTIALLY -- TO TAKE THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL OUT. OF OF THE STATE OCCUPIED ARENA -- OTHER THAN A FEW SPECIFIED -- HI YOU KNOW HI CRITICAL ASSETS LIKE ESSENTIAL SERVICES BUILDINGS AND OTHER THINGS BUT PRIMARILY OUT OF THE BIZ PRIVATELY OWNED. BUSINESS OFFICE -- OCCUPANCY IS THAT WE WE LEASES THE STATE -- THE IDEA IS TO ESSENTIALLY LEAVE THOSE TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- SO THAT YOU KNOW TO MY EARLIER POINT THAT IS ONE OF OUR APPROACHES TO KIND OF STREAMLINED AND AND REMOVE SOME THE DUPLICATION. RIGHT STACK THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO REJECT WITHOUT PREJUDICE. JUST WANT TO KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE OPPOSED TO IS IS SORT OF OPPOSED TO THAT AND WHAT IT WITH THEM I WOULD WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL IS SUBMITTED OKAY OLD. THAT WILL BRING IT UP TO THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

IS TO PROVE HIS PROPOSED. PLEASE CALL ROLL MOTION BY CENTER MINING. CASKEY HI. JONES REQUIRE. MORNING. I BELIEVE THE ROLLOVER FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS AND MOVED TO ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY ONE WHICH IS WILDFIRE REPAIR IN REIMBURSEMENT -- THIS IS SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION FROM GENERAL FUNDS ONE TIME IN TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION EVERY INVERSE THREE FROM THE STATE PARKS RECREATION FUN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS A TOTAL REQUEST FOR TEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AS YOU NOTED. THAT SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION IS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN THE BALANCE OF TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION AS REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY -- THESE ARE FUNDS THAT WOULD BE DESIGNATED TOWARDS PROJECTS SPECIFICALLY -- ASSISTING WITH THE RECOVERY AND THE REPAIR OF DAMAGE FACILITIES -- DIRECTLY AS A RESULT OF THE WILL SEE FIRE DOWN SOUTH SO THE TWO PARKS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE REALLY EMPHASIZED HERE'S THE LEAD OVER CARILLO. STATE PARK AND THE MALIBU CREEK STATE PARK -- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT FEMA HAS ANNOUNCED THAT FEDERAL FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THESE PROJECTS -- AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE AT THE REQUEST FOR TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITIES SO WE'RE ANTICIPATING THE STATE BEING REIMBURSED I ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR COMING TO YOU AND ASKING YOU FOR RESOURCES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE BACK BEFORE YOU NEXT YEAR I ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT -- WE HAVE A MORE DETAILED LIST OF PROJECTS THAT WE INTEND TO SHARE WITH THIS BODY AND ALSO THE LA YOU KNOW WHICH MAY ADDRESS -- YOUR NEED FOR SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE THAT YOU DISCUSS IN YOUR STAFF RECOMMENDATION. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PARKS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STRUCTURES -- WHICH COMES FIRST IS IT BECAUSE I'M I'M THINKING SOME OF THESE AREAS HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW COMPLETELY DESTROYED IN YOU HAVE CAL FIRES IN THEIR WITH THEIR EQUIPMENT AND WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PATHWAY AND AND THE MEADOW AND ALL THAT TYPE OF STUFF. IS THE ISTHE PARK SYSTEM DO YOU LOOK. TO TO WORK ON THE PAST STRUCTURES IN THE I WOULD CALL IN THE NON AMENITIES THE THE BREAD AND BUTTER OF THE PARK SYSTEM YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GET ON THE PATH WAIT AND GO OUT THERE VERSUS THE RANGERS CENTER -- INTERPRETIVE CENTRE DAT I KNOW THEY'RE BOTH NEED TO BE DONE BUT IF YOU HAD FIRST MONEY OUT THE DOOR BECAUSE WHAT I'M. CONCERNED WHAT IS THAT OR JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU SAID IF YOU HAVE SOMETIMES WE SEE THOSE SIGNS WITH THE PATH IS CLOSE BECAUSE THE PARK IS UNDER REPAIR. NO I CAN'T WE CAN'T GET HERE AND AND WOOD IS IT YOUR INTENTION TO GO THROUGH AND DO ALL THAT WORK OR BUILD THE INTERPRETIVE CENTER. FIRST SEMESTER CHAIR I THINK PERHAPS WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE RECEIVED RELATIVE TO THIS PROPOSAL IS Y. REFOCUSING ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHEN AROUND THE SAME TIME WE HAD -- THE FIRE THAT DEVASTATED THE CAMPFIRE -- IN IN RESPONSE TO THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A LOSS OF FACILITIES IN THE CAMPFIRE SO YOU SEE THESE PROJECT DOLLARS FOCUSING ON THE WILL THE FIRE AREA -- WE ARE ALREADY ACTUALLY OUT THERE MAKING SOME REPAIRS WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING THE AFTER EFFECTS OF THE WILL SEE FIRE SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE BURNING OF THE VEGETATION IN THE LEO CARILLO STATE PARK THAT MAKES US VULNERABLE. TO THINGS LIKE -- EROSION AND THE SLIDING OF DEBRIS FROM THE HILL SIDE I WAS THERE TWO WEEKS AGO -- AND YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS PRIOR YOU WERE ABLE TO WALK UNDER A ROADWAY AND NOW IT'S FILLED WITH DEBRIS AND MUD SO WE ARE ALREADY IN THERE WITH CREWS -- CLEANING THAT UP I THINK THE FIRST THING WE DO IS WE THINK ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE WANT TO OPEN THE PARK BACK. TO LEO CARILLO CURRENTLY IS CLOSE WE ANTICIPATE RE OPENING IT BY THE END OF MAY -- WE LOST -- ALL OF OUR HEAVY EQUIPMENT DOWN IN THAT AREA WAS WERE BURNED AND SO WE IMMEDIATELY -- SOLVE THAT THROUGH KIND OF REDISTRIBUTING. HEAVY EQUIPMENT THROUGHOUT OUR OWN STATE DEPARTMENT -- BUT WHAT I EXPECT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE LIST TOMORROW IS A REAL FOCUS ON PLANNING AND TAKING A LOOK AT ALL OF THE FACILITIES AND SO I THINK PUBLIC SAFETY COMES FIRST THE THINGS THAT PREVENT US. FROM BEING ABLE TO RE OPEN THE PARK -- REST FACILITIES SO THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE THE MOST DIRECT IMPACT ON A VISITOR'S EXPERIENCE BUT WE EXPECT THIS TO BE A MULTI YEAR PHASED EFFORT. ALEJO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THE MALIBU CREEK OR LEO CARILLO STATE PARKS. SURE SO. I THINK ARC ARE COMMENTS ON THIS WHEN AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN DAMAGE THAT HAS HAPPENED I AM AT STATE PARKS -- FROM FROM THE WALL THE FIRE AND DAMAGE FROM OTHER FIRES AS WELL AND AND SO IT'S IT'S TOTALLY REASONABLE FOR AND PARKS TO YOU NEED RESOURCES TO REPAIR. THE DAMAGE AND ONE OF THE THE CONCERNS THAT WE RAISED IS THAT THAT PROPOSAL THAT WAS -- PROVIDED DOESN'T IDENTIFY DETAILS ABOUT THE TYPES OF PROJECTS I AM ARE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PART OF THIS FUNDING -- WOULD BE USED TO ACTUALLY DO A MORE THOROUGH ASSESSMENT -- AND THAT THERE'S ALSO SOME SORT OF INITIAL EARLY IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS THAT HAVE A BIT BEEN IDENTIFIED. AND AND SO WE JUST THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAVE AND THAT INFORMATION ON HOW MUCH OF THE FINDINGS GOING TO GO TO THE ASSESSMENT. HOW MUCH WILL GO TO PROJECTS AND WHICH PROJECTS AND ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS IS GOING TO BE A MULTI YEAR EFFORT AND THIS IS JUST THE FIRST SLICE OF IT? AND AND IN ORDER MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROJECTS THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING A LINE IT WITH AND WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES ARE WITH WHAT. MEMBERS IN THAT DISTRICT ARE HEARING AND THE PRIORITIES ARE AND AND THAT YOU CAN REALLY HOLD PARKS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACHIEVING AND THIS PIECE OF THAT REPAIR AND RESTORATION BEFORE THEY COME BACK REQUESTING MORE FUNDING IN THE FUTURE. THAT NUMBER US. UP FOR US THE MISTER CHAIR I BELIEVE THAT THE LIST THAT YOU'LL BE RECEIVING THE LA -- WILL BE RECEIVING TOMORROW WILL ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO MEET AND TALK WITH THEM OKAY LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARINGS AFRICAN NATIONS TO PROVE AS PROPOSED IN REQUEST THEM. SUB MODEL REPORTING WHICH ACTUALLY WILL COME IN TOMORROW. GREAT. LET'S CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING -- THERE'S A MOTION [inaudible] TO APPROVED. ALL RIGHT PLEASE CULTURAL. WHITE HOUSE BY JONES MCGUIRE MONNING. STERN. WE'LL KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN FOR THOSE ABSENT MEMBERS LET'S MOVE TWO HARBORS IN WILD WATER CRAFT THE REVOLVING FUND SURE THIS IS ISSUE THIRTY TWO AND THIS IS A STABILIZATION PROPOSAL. FOR TWO OF US OUR SPECIAL FUNDS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IS. ANTICIPATED APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN INCREASED ON GOING REVENUES FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO THE PASSAGE OF SB. ONE HOWEVER THIS ESTIMATE IS NOW LOWER DO IT A REFINEMENT OF THE FORMULA USED BY CONTROL AGENCIES TO CALCULATE THE FUEL TAX REVENUES. AVAILABLE FOR OUR PROGRAMS -- THIS PROPOSAL HERE BEFORE YOU PROVIDES GENERAL FUND SUPPORT -- TO PREVENTING THE COMMITMENT TO THE FIX OUR PARKS PROPOSAL APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR -- BY WAY OF A LITTLE MORE DETAIL PROVIDES THIRTY FIVE MILLION POINT SEVEN MIL POINT SEVEN AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AND NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS. THE STATE PARKS AND RECREATION FUND SHORTFALL HAND A REVERSION OF TWENTY THREE MILLION IN ON COMMITTED PRIOR YOUR HARBORS AND WATERCRAFT FUNDS TO ADDRESS THE HARBORS MARKUP FUND SHORTFALL -- ALSO PART OF THIS PACKAGE IS PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WILL CLARIFY EFFECTUATE THESE CHANGES [inaudible] YEAH. YEAH LA OF YOUR COMMENTS ON SAID IT IS A VERY UNFORTUNATE SITUATION ADMIT THAT THIS LEAVES YOUR PARKS IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE. THE AND THAT SEE PARKS RECREATION FENDER SPUR FRIEND HAD THAT AND HAD IT'S TIME TO FIND A BALANCE CONCERNS OVER THE YEARS WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB WENDY COMPREHEND COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING PACKAGE. ON THAT ALSO HAD A SMALL AMOUNT OF MANY AND THAT WAS GOING TO PARKS AND IT REALLY SORT OF SHORT UP THIS BIRTH AND PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND THE FOR THAT THE FIX OUR PARKS INITIATIVE AS WAS ALLUDED TALE. AND THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT IN THE VARIOUS AND TRANSFERS AND CALCULATIONS ATTY WAS BASICALLY OVER ESTIMATED HOW MUCH MONEY WAS GOING TO BE COMING FROM SB WHEN. TO ASK FOR IF AS WELL AS THE HARBORS AND WATERCRAFT REVOLVING FIND AND AND THROUGH THE COURSE AS I DECIDING HOW TO SPEND THEIR TO SHOW SB WHEN FRIENDS. I IN THE CURRENT YEAR BASICALLY THESE ACCOUNTS FOR OVER COMMITTED ARE BASED ON THE REVENUES ARE ACTUALLY COMING AND AND SO THE PROPOSAL HERE IS SORT OF ADDRESSING AND IT'S THE ISSUE IS BIGGER IN NINETEEN TWENTY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A COUPLE YEARS WORTH OF REVENUE THAT HAVE BEEN COMING. IN LOWER THAN ESTIMATED -- AND SO ADDRESSING THAT BUT IT'S ALSO I'M PROPOSING FOR THIS FIRST ANYWAYS TO HAVE AN ONGOING AND NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND BACK FELL. AND THE WE WOULD JUST SORT OF NOTE GIVEN HOW RECENTLY AS SOME OF THESE AUGMENTATIONS WERE PUT INTO PLACE FOR PARKS. AND ME JUST BEING IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALWAYS WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH A FIND. IN IMBALANCE ISSUE WHERE YOU'RE-EXPENDITURES ARE OUTPACING YOUR REVENUES. AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN USE GENERAL FUND TO BACK FILL IT YOU CAN ALSO BRING YOUR EXPENDITURES DOWN AND GIVEN HOW RECENTLY. THESE AUGMENTATIONS WERE MADE AND WE DID THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE A ONE APPROACH FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IT'S AN OPTION -- TO MAYBE MODERATE SOME OF THOSE AUGMENTATIONS IN ORDER TO BRING -- THAT THE FIX OUR PARKS FOR PULLS ALL MORE IN LINE WITH THE ACTUAL REVENUES ON THE HARBORS AND WATERCRAFT SIDE I WOULD JUST TO NOTE THAT. ON THE THE PROPOSAL HERE IS A ONE TIME SOLUTION AND SO -- WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE THAT THE MINISTRATION WOULD BRING FOR AN ONGOING SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM -- SOMETIME NEXT YEAR AND THAT FRIEND HAS A SIXTEEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL ON TO EVEN LARGER THAN THIS. FOR SHORTFALL AND AND NOT WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT IS ALSO ADDRESSED WITH I AM ON ONGOING GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER SIXTEEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. I THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE MINISTRATION WILL BE LOOKING AT AND COMING BACK OUR NEXT YEAR YEAH BECAUSE THERE'S A BREAKDOWN BETWEEN THE TAX. THE TAX OF MONEY TO COME INTO THE BOAT FOLKS AND I GUESS THE TAX MONEY COMES INTO THE THE PARK PEOPLE MAGAZINE SOME PARKS OF BOATS BUT THOSE ARE. THAT'S IT. EASILY SEPARATED A CALCULATION WHICH SOMEBODY'LL GET RIGHT THIS YEAR -- OKAY THE I GUESS THE QUESTION ALEJO HE SAID NO THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD WE'VE WITH ROCKET I DON'T WANT TO OPEN IT UP ON THE BACKLOG OF PARK. YOU KNOW REPAIRS THAT NEED TO BE DONE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S I REMEMBER THE BE NUMBER COMING UP AND HAVE. A BILLIONS OF MONEY THAT NEEDS TO BE VERSUS A YOU KNOW A STATE GENERAL FUND. CONTRIBUTION SOMETHING SOUTH OF TEN MILLION SO I THINK THAT THAT TEN IN THE BIGGER PICTURE LEAST PREVIOUS HEARINGS THAT WE'VE HAD. THE PROBLEM IS GIGANTIC AND IN THIS IS. I GUESS WE'VE MADE MISTAKES SO GONNA FIX THE MISTAKE AND THEN. KEEP PAN I'M GOING ONE WAY LOOK AT IT -- ALL RIGHT. LET'S THIS IS THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS APPROVED AS PROPOSE LET'S HOPE UP PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS [inaudible] OKAY. YOU GET LUCKY THIS TIME KNOWN AS KIDNEY CAM K&lt;c.cyan&gt; THIS KIDDING.&lt;/c&gt; MAY RIVERS MAKING THAT FOR POLL OF WHO'S EVER MAKING THOSE SB ONE CALCULATIONS ON THE FUEL TAX. SHARPEN THE PENCIL -- ALL RIGHT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE CASKEY HI JONES MCGUIRE. MINING. STERN. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE THREE VOTES LET'S KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN FOR THE AFTER MEMBERS AND THAT'S IT. FOR PARKS AND RECREATION. LET'S CALL OF SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY. AND THE FRIEND PAVLEY MEADOW THE THE SEVENTY YEAR AS OWSKI LAST VERGE JANICE. HARRY HAD HE VERY HEINOUS VIRGINIA VIRGIN ASSESS VIRGINIS. HIGHLAND PARK IN MANY OTHER PRIORITY LOCATIONS. I'M BRING CASH IN WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY HERE REPRESENTING THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME. INTO POSITIONS -- WITH FIVE YEARS OF SPENDING. AUTHORITY -- TO COVER THE COSTS THE STATE COSTS OF THE FIRE DAMAGE -- DONE BY THE WILL SEE FIRE -- THE CONSERVANCY HAD TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES THAT WERE AFFECTED IN LOTS OF FACILITIES SO THIS FUNDING WILL BE THE STATE FUNDING TOWARDS ACTUALLY REPEAT MAKING THOSE REPAIRS AND DOING THE RESTORATION WORK NEEDED. SIMILAR TO PARKS THE CONSERVANCY IS GOING TO PRIORITIZE SAFETY FIRST. AND THEN MOVE ON TO OPENING UP THE PARKS IN ALLOWING PEOPLE TO GET BACK ON THE TRAILS AS YOU MENTIONED. WE'RE NOT NAIVE TO THINK THAT FIFTEEN MILLION WILL COVER EVERYTHING WE JUST REALIZED THIS IS THIS BUDGET REQUEST AND AS WE LOOK AT THIS -- DIFFERENT AMENITIES ALEJO. WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS AT THIS PROPOSAL AND THAT THE FIFTY MILLION OUR UNDERSTANDING IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE EXTENT OF THEIR REQUEST AND THE PROPOSAL DID HAVE A LOT MORE DETAIL CAM -- THEN THE PARKS PROPOSAL DID IN TERMS OF HOW THE FUNDS TO BE SPENT -- AND WHERE AND HOUSES AND EVEN OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA HERE WHAT AND WHAT WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE AND AND HOW WOULD BE PRIORITIZED IN SO WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT NEEDING HAD LEGISLATURE NEEDING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A MULTI YEAR AND THAT THIS WOULD BE THE EXTENT OF THE PROPOSAL. AND AND SO WE WE FELT INFORMATION HERE IS SUFFICIENT. RIGHT TO SEPARATE CONDITIONS TO PROVE HIS PROPOSED LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ANYBODY. ON THE SANTA MONICA [inaudible] MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY. ONCE I REQUEST. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING BRING IT BACK. THERE'S IN MOTION BY CENTERS TERM PLEASE CALL THE ROLL LAKE CASKEY HIGH. JONES REQUIRE MONEY [inaudible] TURN [inaudible] WE OKAY THANK YOU ARE THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IS ISSUE NUMBER -- THIRTY FOUR AND ISSUE NUMBER. THIRTY FIVE IN ISSUE NUMBER. THIRTY SIX D. W. R. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS OUR CO COME THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT DAM SAFETY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES. I WILL BE ADDRESSING THE NEXT THREE ITEMS -- WITH SOME EXPERT THAT I BROUGHT ALONG WITH ME. WELL THE FIRST ISSUES DELIVERS REQUEST WAR SICKENING POSITIONS OF ONE POINT SIX TWO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF ONGOING FUNDING FROM THE DAM SAFETY FUND. GIVEN THIS OF THE REMAINING THREE YEARS OF THE ONE POINT SIXTY FIVE MILLION ANNUAL FEEDBACK OF THE GENERAL FUND LOAN MADE IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO INCORPORATE RISK INFORMED DECISION MAKING INTO THE CALIFORNIA DAM SAFETY PROGRAM. AS RECOMMENDED BY THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY PANEL PROCESS SPELLED OUT IN -- OR AB. EIGHT TWELVE SEVENTY SO WITH THAT. WHAT'S THE FIRST. ONE AB SEVEN YEAH. WHEN YOU GET HERE? WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO BRING UP CHAIR AND HAPPIER TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE FURTHER WITH YOU WE GET A LITTLE BIT OUT OF WHACK THERE ON OUR SCHEDULE. CAMEOS ANXIOUS TO GO SO WITH THAT SHARED HAPPY AS SHE IS THE CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF SAFETY OF DAMS -- AND HAS THE DETAILS OF THIS PROPOSAL. I GET AFTERNOON -- AS ERIC SAID -- I'M THE CHIEF OF THE DIVISION A SAFETY DAM. DANCE AND WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF THE CALIFORNIA DAM SAFETY PROGRAM. AND THAT PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED NINETY YEARS AGO THIS YEAR AFTER THAT CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE SAINT FRANCIS DAM. WE HAVE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF APPROXIMATELY TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE FEDERAL DAMS ACROSS THE STATE. ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY OF THOSE DAMS ARE CONSIDERED HIGH OR EXTREMELY HIGH HAZARD. IN THAT MEANS IF. THERE IS A FAILURE OUT ONE OF THOSE DAMS IT WOULD HAVE AT LEAST ONE LOSS OF LIFE. AND THAT'S BY THE FEDERAL DEFINITION -- SINCE HAZARD POTENTIAL DOESN'T REALLY -- INDICATE. AS THE SAFETY OF THE DAM WE CONDUCT BOTH -- FIELD INSPECTIONS IN RE EVALUATIONS TO ASSESS THE SAFETY OF THE DAM. TRADITIONALLY WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS ACTUALLY SINCE -- THE FAILURE OF THIS -- BALDWIN HILLS DAM THAT OCCURRED IN THE SIXTIES THAT'S WHEN OUR PROGRAM FIRST STARTED READ LOOKING AT DAMS. BECAUSE BY THEN THOSE DAMS WORD NEARLY AGING FIFTY YEARS AT THAT TIME RIGHT. AND CONDITIONS HAD CHANGED BECAUSE OF DOWNSTREAM POPULATION INCREASE. IN SO WITH THAT IF YOU MOVE AHEAD INTO THE EARLY SEVENTIES WE HAD THE SAN FERNANDO EARTHQUAKE. THAT NEARLY I WILL FAILED THE UPSTREAM OF LOWER SAN FERNANDO DAM. AND ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED IN THAT REALLY TRIGGERED THE ONSET OF UNDERSTANDING SEISMIC IN THE STATE. AND SINCE THAT TIME SEISMIC EVALUATIONS HAS BEEN A BIG FOCUS OF THE PROGRAM BUT IT'S BEEN A VERY FOCUSED -- EVALUATION APPROACH IN A VERY TRADITIONAL APPROACH SO WE WOULD LOOK AT WHAT'S THE HIGHEST RISK FOR DANCING IN CALIFORNIA GIVEN OUR OUR COMPLEX GEOLOGY IN OUR SEISMIC ACTIVITY IT'S IT'S BEEN SEISMIC. AND SO WITH THAT WE FOCUSED ON SIZE MAKING WE'VE ALSO FOCUSED -- AS INCIDENTS OCCUR SO WE HAVE THAT A FULSOME GATE FILL YOUR NINETEEN NINETY FIVE SO WE DID A SPECIAL STUDY OF RADIO GATES. IN THE STATE -- AND SO WITH THAT APPROACH WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT PARTICULAR FAILURE MODES. A YOU KNOW A SINGLE TYPE OF FAILURE MODE FOR AS A DAM AND WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT DOES IT DOES. HOW DOES THE DEMAND IN THE CAPACITY RELATE TO EACH OTHER AND WE WOULD COME UP LIKE WITH THE FACTOR OF SAFETY? I AM GOING FORWARD SO THAT METHOD HAD HAD PROVEN PROVEN OUT WELL WE WERE YOU KNOW WITH THE STANDARDS AT THE TIME -- BUT THAT'S A VERY. LABOR INTENSIVE WAY TO DO RE EVALUATIONS AND SO WE ONLY GET THROUGH ABOUT TEN TO TWENTY DAMS A YEAR WITH THAT APPROACH. AND AGAIN WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT ONE FAILURE MODE SO IF THEY DARE MEETS THE SEISMIC FAILURE MODE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT DOWN. FOR SEISMIC WE DON'T SIT THERE AND LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF THE DAM COMPREHENSIVELY AND LOOK AT HOW ELSE COULD THIS DIEM FAIL. NO COULD HAVE FAILED THROUGH THE OUTLET PIPE COULD FAIL THROUGH THE SPILL WAY WHAT OTHER MEANS WOULD BECAUSE THE FAILURE. SO -- WITH THAT WE HAVE AB TWELVE SEVENTY THAT WAS ENACTED JUST LAST YEAR. AND NOW IS ACTUALLY ENACTED UNDER EMERGENCY CLAUSE. IN IT REQUIRED OUR PROGRAMS TO HAVE. A A PEER REVIEW. TO A CONVENE A PANEL OF INDEPENDENT EXPERTS OF DAM SAFETY FROM NATIONAL DAM SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS. AND IN PARTICULAR THE LANGUAGE IN THE LEGISLATION STATED WE ALSO HAD TO HAVE RISK MANAGEMENT. INCORPORATED INTO OUR PROTOCOLS. IN SO WELL WITH THAT DIRECTIVE LAST YEAR WE CONVENED A PANEL OF HIGHLY RECOGNIZED EXPERTS IN DAM SAFETY. WE HAD FOURTEEN MEMBERS AND WE HAD REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE ASSOCIATION A STATE DAM SAFETY OFFICIALS. WE HAD THE US SOCIETY ON DAMS. AND WE HAD THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AS SPECIALLY FOR THEIR EXPERTISE AND RISK. AND WE ALSO HAD THE U. S. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION AGAIN FOR THEIR EXPERTISE AND RISK. SO WE HAD A VERY COMPREHENSIVE PANEL WE ALSO HAD OTHER STATE REGULATORS ON THE PANEL WE HAD -- A FEW DAM OWNERS -- TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY WAS ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE PANEL AND WE HAD SOME CONSULTANTS. ON THE PANEL SO IT WAS A REALLY. IT WAS A REALLY GOOD PANEL AND SO WE MET AT THREE TIMES LAST YEAR IN IN PERSON THEY ALL CAME TO SACRAMENTO WE PRESENTED OUR PROGRAM TO THEM. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THEIR SOUL RECOMMENDATION IS CALIFORNIA YOU NEED TO BE DOING RISK. WHICH IS WHICH IS. NO WE WEREN'T SURPRISED -- THE INTERSTATE HE HAD ADVANCED QUITE A BIT PROBABLY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. IN TERMS OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND DAM SAFETY AND THAT WAS SOMETHING WE HAD NOT YET -- STARTED DOING WE DID IT AND FORMALLY WE CONSIDERED RISK OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT EARTHQUAKES WERE LOOKING AT THE PROBABILITY OF THE EARTHQUAKE. BUT NOT TO THE FORMALIZED METHODOLOGIES THAT THE ARMY CORPS AND THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION DO FOR THEIR DAMS. AND THEY THOUGHT BASED ON THE SIZE OF OUR PROGRAM AND BEING THE LARGEST STAMP SAFETY PROGRAM IN THE NATION WE REALLY NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT RISK MANAGEMENT INTO OUR PROGRAM. AND SO THAT'S THE PROPOSAL THAT'S IN THE B. C. P. IT'S FOR SIX POSITIONS. AND AT A COST OF ONE POINT SIX TWO FIVE MILLION. WE'VE RECENTLY INCREASED OUR OUR DAM FEES. AND OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS ARE DAM FEES HAVE GONE UP ABOUT 55%. AND SO THE PROPOSAL IN THE B. C. P. IS TO ACTUALLY -- HAVE A LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS OF PAYMENT OF OUR GENERAL FUND LOAN THAT WE RECEIVED IN. TWO YEARS AGO. AND THAT WOULD M. COMPLETELY OFFSET ANY FEE INCREASES THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THIS PROPOSAL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SO. THESE ARE PRIVATELY OWNED DAMS. THAT THE STATE IS INSPECTING FOR THE RISK ANALYSIS AND THE SAFETY. CORRECT SO WE HAVE -- WE HAVE. S. ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE DAM OWNERS. AND IT'S COMPRISED OF MULTIPLE TYPE OF OWNERS YOU GOT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS AN OWNER YOU HAVE COUNTIES. YOU OF WATER DISTRICTS YOU HAVE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS. YOU HAVE PRIVATE CITIZENS FARMERS AND RANCHERS YOU HAVE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS. A IS SO IT'S A IT'S ACROSS THE GAMUT OF THE TYPE OF OWNERSHIP. MUST BE FROM WHEN YOU GUYS ALL GET TOGETHER SO -- AND SOME OF THESE DAMS WERE BUILT OBVIOUSLY AT DIFFERENT TIMES WERE RISK ANALYSIS WAS. HOCUS POCUS PEOPLE YEAH YOU BUILT YOUR YOU OFFER YOU YOU HAD TO USE THAT YOU HAD BUT THERE WAS NO STATE. RISK MANAGEMENT CROWD COMING INTO TO LOOK TO LOOK AT YOUR YOUR DAM -- SO. I'M TRYING TO EVALUATE I GET THE ONE POINT SIX MILLION AND I GET DE DE. GRACE PERIOD ONE TWO OR THREE YEARS THAT YOU WANT TO NOT HAVE THESE LOANS PAID BACK TO THE STATE SO THAT THE OR FORGIVE THE LOANS SO THAT THE DAM OWNERS. WILL. HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY THE HIGHER FEES SHE GONE UP 55% GET IT I GET IT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS BIGGER PICTURE [inaudible] IS THAT. IF WE DON'T OWN THAT ADVOCATE SOME OF THE STATE TAKE THE STATE DAMS OUT IF THESE ARE OWNED BY OTHER PEOPLE OR OTHER ENTITIES AND THEY CREATE A RISK. NOT TODAY WE THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE REST WHEN THEY BUILT IT BUT THERE'S REST NOW -- AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET. SIX MORE PEOPLE OUT THERE DOING THE SUPER DUPER RISK MANAGEMENT ON DAMS NOT JUST EARTHQUAKE OR NOT JUST SPILL WAY BECAUSE I GET. YOU KNOW WE TEN THE OVER OVERSIMPLIFICATION RESPOND TO HERE'S A CATASTROPHE PLEASE HELP MY DISTRICT OUT HELP THIS AND AND NOW DO THIS GET THESE PEOPLE TO INSPECTED THEY'RE NOT OUR DAMS I MEAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THEY'RE PART OF OUR SYSTEM AND WE WANT TO PROTECT LIFE AND LIMB. LIFE AND ALL THAT SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IT BUT HOW DO WE OKAY SAID THE SAID THERE'S A JUSTIFICATION THAT WE'RE THE FACT -- SUBSIDIZING THE PRIVATE OWNERS IF THEY'RE NOT PAYING BACK THE LOANS THAT THEY OWN -- BUT BUT IS THE IS THE IDEA THAT. IN THREE YEARS THEY'RE GOING TO JUST HAVE TO PASS ON RATES TO WATER USERS OR DO WHATEVER THEY NEED TO DO TO GET THEIR FINANCIAL HOUSE. IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THAT. NOT ONLY JUST THE ANALYSIS OF YOU YOUR FOLKS TO SAY THIS IS WRONG THIS IS WRONG BUT FIX IT. YOU KNOW DO WAY WOULD NEED TO BE DONE IS THAT. THE PLAY HERE. WELL SO I THINK WE'VE ALWAYS DONE RISK MANAGEMENT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE GO WHAT WE WANT TO CONCENTRATE A WE GO OUT TO REVIEW DAM SAFETY OKAY WE REQUIRED REVIEW THE DAMS ANNUALLY. SO WE MAY BE LOOKING AT SPILLWAYS A MAY BE LOOKING AT THE DAM STRUCTURES ITSELF. WHAT THIS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TO INCORPORATE THIS RISK OF FOR MANAGEMENT THIS IS A PROCESSES USED BY THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS? AND AND THE US BUREAU INTO OUR THINKING AS TO HOW WE AS REGULATORS IN CALIFORNIA OF THESE DAMS CAN MORE QUICKLY ZERO IN ON THOSE TO HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS. AND THEN WORK WITH THOSE OWNERS TO MAKE SURE THE CORRECT THOSE PROBLEMS SO IT'S KIND OF A A UGH. MOVING INTO THE THE STATED THE PRACTICE IF YOU WILL IN TERMS OF HOW WE APPROACH WHAT ARE JOBS ARE IN REGARDS -- TO MANAGING -- DETERMINING WHAT THAT RISK OF THOSE DAMS ARE OUT THERE BUT I GOT TO BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THESE DAMS WERE BUILT FIFTY SIXTY YEARS AGO WITH NOT. EVEN WHEN THEY WERE BUILT THEY WERE NOT TOPLINE DAMS IF YOU COULD IF I COULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE WHATEVER THEY WERE JUST BUILT BECAUSE HE NEEDED AN IRRIGATION SYSTEM OR WHATEVER WHEREVER PEOPLE WERE DOING AND NOW WE'VE GOT. PEOPLE LIVE IN IN THE IN THE AREA SOME PEOPLE LIVE IN THEIR NATIVE DID THERE'S BEEN. OTHER DECISIONS NOT THE STATE'S DECISIONS OTHER LOCAL DECISIONS THAT HAVE PT PEOPLE IN HARM'S WAY -- THAT YOU GUYS ARE EVALUATING TAT. HE BUT YOU WANT TO DO IT ANYWAY NO I GUESS NOT. WHAT TO DO THE EVALUATION TO SEE WHO THE IT'S PART OF WHAT WE DO I MEAN THAT'S FINE? WHAT WE DO IN TERMS THAT'S WHO WE ARE IT'S WHAT WE ARE IN TERMS OF REGULATION OF DAMS YES AND SAFETY AND IS BITING FOR THAT SAFETY A DOWNSTREAM AND YOU'RE CORRECT OVER THE YEARS OVER THE DECADES? THERE THAT SAFETY CONCERN HAS GROWN BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVED INTO THE BOTTOM NEXT TO THEM SO HOLD ON TO MAKE SURE THOSE DAMS ARE AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AND THIS IS A METHODOLOGY A WAY OF THINKING. OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE SO WHAT POWER DOES THE STATE HAVE TO TELL A DAM OWNER IT'S NOT SAFE FOR OR JUST THERE'S NO THERE'S NO REPAIR WORK THIS COULD GO ON HERE GIVEN THE NEW ANALYSIS THAT ARE DECISION MAKING DAM SAFETY. FOLKS ARE GOING TO DO. THIRTY EIGHT DEMENTORS STATE THEY HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY HAM LIABILITY SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY RESPONSIBLE THEY FULLY FOUNDER PROGRAM AS IT IS RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE THEY'VE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DEVELOPING THEIR INUNDATION MAPS. THE LEGISLATION AS BE NINETY TWO THEY'RE EA PEAS WE'VE HAD -- QUITE A FEW OF THEM GO OUT AND DO CONDITION ASSESSMENTS ON THEIR SPILLWAYS GET DATA. AND WHENEVER WE COME UP WITH A DEFICIENCY. THEY HAVE TO GO OUT AND GET A CONSULTING ENGINEER THEY HAVE TO ALSO ANALYZE IT THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO FIX IT AND THEY HAVE TO FIND THE FUNDING TO FIX IT. AND SO ULTIMATELY THE DAY BEAR THAT BIG TICKET COST ON DAM OWNERSHIP AND WHAT THIS DOES IS ALLOW US TO GET THREE WHERE I MENTIONED WE DO TEND TO TWENTY A YEAR. THE GOAL WITH THIS IS A SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY HIGH HAZARD DAMS WE WOULD BE EVALUATING THEM ABOUT EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS. RIGHT. ALL OF THEM NOT TEN TO TWENTY A YEAR WHICH WOULD TAKE IS. THREE DECADES TO GET HER AND HENCE WE'RE GONNA FIND GIVE YOU THIS LITTLE LOAN BALANCE WILL FORGIVE THAT OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND THE BIG THE BIG CHALLENGES THE BIG -- TICKET ITEMS PRICE TICKET ITEMS ARE GOING TO BE THERE. ELLIE -- AND THEN SENT. THE FEES THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS CHARGING THE DEMOS HAVE ALREADY BEEN RAISED SO THEY WERE RAISED. WILL BE REYES 20% AGAIN IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO COVER THE COSTS OF SOME OF THE PREVIOUS INCREASED ACTIVITIES THE DEPARTMENT'S REQUIRING SO THE INUNDATION MAPS AND THE EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS. FOR THOSE THOSE COSTS ARE ALREADY THOSE FEES ARE ALREADY INCREASED ON THE DAM OWNERS AND WOOD AND WILL BE TO COVER THOSE -- IF. AND THEN ONCE THEY TAKE CARE OF THOSE ONE TIME ACTIVITIES THEN THOSE HIGHER FEES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN INCREASED WILL START TO COVER THE SIX NEW POSITIONS SO I THINK THE PROPOSAL THE FROM THE DEPARTMENT IS TO AVOID. AND A DIVISIONAL INCREASE FOR THESE NEW POSITIONS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS SO IT'S NOT AVOIDING. THEM INCREASING NOW THEY THEY ARE FACING INCREASES NOW IS JUST BE KIND OF THE DOUBLE WHAMMY ABOVE THAT 55% FOR THREE YEARS. SO IN IN OUR AN ANALYSIS IT IS YOU KNOW IT IS A LITTLE BIT INCONSISTENT WITH OUR BENEFICIARY PAYS. PRACTICE THAT WE USUALLY HAVE FOR THE DAM OWNERS BUT GIVEN IT'S A RELATIVELY MODERATE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND FOUR POINT NINE MILLION AND IT IS BEEN A LOT OF INCREASED COSTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. IN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME PERIOD ON THESE OWNERS WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE CEREMONY OF QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I'M. I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE BALDWIN HILLS. FAILURE AND WATCHING THAT ON TELEVISION. WAS ONE OF THE FIRST REAL TIME DISASTERS I THINK ON TV. MORE RECENTLY WE PARTICIPATED WITH YOUR DIVISION IN THE REMOVAL OF THE SAME CALL MANY DAM IN THE UPPER CARMEL RIVER WHICH WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST DAM REOVAL PROJECTS. PERHAPS ANYWHERE CERTAINLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT MY QUESTION -- SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DAMS CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED AS HIGH OR EXTREMELY HIGH HAZARD -- WITH THESE NEW POSITIONS OR WITH CURRENT PLANNING. ARE YOU DOING ANY. EVALUATION I'M WITH AMONG THOSE. SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DO YOU HAVE ANY RANKING AMONG THOSE OF ONES THAT POSE A GREATER RISK THAN OTHERS IN TERMS OF PROXIMITY TO POPULATION. CENTERS OR NEW POPULATION CENTERS OR LIKELIHOOD OF FAILURE VERSES. SIZE MAKE SOME SEISMIC ISSUES BUT NOT AN EVALUATION OF LIKELY FAILURE -- CORRECT CORRECT -- AS WE'VE BEEN DOING OUR SEISMIC REVALUATION PROGRAM OVER THE LAST TEN TWENTY YEARS THAT'S WE WE ALWAYS START OFF WITH THE SCREENING ASSESSMENT. AND WE WOULD LOOK AT THE AGE OF THE DAM HOW IT WAS CONSTRUCTED BECAUSE THAT PLAYS INTO HOW. HOW WELL IT CAN WITHSTAND AN EARTHQUAKE AND THEN THE PROXIMITY TO THE CLOSEST EARTHQUAKE IN WHAT THE? SHAKING WOULD BE AT THAT DAM SITE AND SO WE HAD A WE HAVE A LIST OF FACTORS IN WE WOULD DO AN INITIAL SCREENING. BUT THAT WAS REALLY SOLELY FOCUSED ON SEISMIC IT WASN'T LOOKING AT ALL THE OTHER FIFTEEN PLUS WAYS A CAN FAIL. AND REALLY GETTING IN DEPTH INTO IT AND AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS RISK INFORMED DECISION MAKING PROCESS WILL ALLOW US TO DO IS LOOK AT ALL THOSE AT THE WRISTS TOGETHER ALONG WITH. THE HIGH POPULATION AREAS AND THOSE HIGH RISK MY DAMAGED AREAS DOWNSTREAM IF YOU WILL AND THEN PRIORITIZE THEM BASED ON THAT% THAT'S THE WHOLE GOAL OVER TRYING TO DO [inaudible] IN. SHARE WITH ME AGAIN WITH WITH THIS ALLOCATION. AGAIN WITH A TOTAL OF TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY DAM SOME SIX HUNDRED FIFTY RATED HIGH RISK OR EXTREMELY HIGH HAZARD. HOW OFTEN WILL YOU WILL THERE BE AN ANNUAL -- ASSESSMENT OF EACH OF THESE STAMPS. THE LETTER CURRENTLY YET CURRENTLY WE GET THROUGH ABOUT. ACTUALLY FOR CLOSE TO A DOZEN A YEAR YOU KNOW I SAY TEN TO TWENTY BUT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE OTHER WORK LET IT'S GOING ON WITH THE OWNERS THAT HAVE PLANS AND SPECS WHO WANT TO GET OUT THERE AND DO THEIR REPAIRS. AND SO LET'S JUST SAY WE DO A DOZEN A YEAR WITH THIS THE GOAL WOULD BE TO DO THE SCREENING AND TO PRIORITIZE SEIZE THE FAILURE MODES. ABOUT ONE OF ON A BASIS OF ABOUT EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS FOR THE ENTIRE INVENTORY. IN ITS USING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT APPROACH AND IT'S A DIFFERENT IT'S IT SHIPPED IN CULTURE TO IT'S IT'S RISK INFORMED DECISION MAKING AND SO YOU'RE THINKING YEARS CHANGING HOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE THING AND WHEN IT'S A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM THAT'S NEEDED TO DO IT. IT'S CERTAINLY A HUGE IMPROVEMENT IN A NEW METHODOLOGY. BEGIN GETTING THROUGH THE MALL ONCE EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS STILL CREATES. QUITE A GAP OF POTENTIAL LACK OF SURVEILLANCE TO I KNOW IT IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T BECAUSE IN THE ENGINEERING INDUSTRY. TECHNOLOGY AND AND ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING OCCUR ABOUT EVERY TEN TO TWENTY YEARS SO WE'RE GONNA BE RIGHT AT THAT POINT WHERE THERE ARE CHANGES OCCURRING LIKE -- NOW I'LL GO BACK TO SAN FERNANDO NOW WE KNOW SAM'S LIQUEFY OKAY SO ONCE YOU START LEARNING NEW YOU KNOW NEW SEAT RESEARCH. DEVELOPS YOU'RE GONNA BE APPLYING THAT EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS AS YOU GO THROUGH THAT CYCLE. IT'S IT'S A MUCH BETTER WAY OF DOING IT AND IT ALSO REMEMBER. ANNUALLY WE INSPECT EVERY THAT'S OUT THERE SO THANK YOU ARE AT REAL TWENTY AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT PARTICULAR DAMP FROM THE SURFACE SIDE OF IT AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT LOOKING. BEYOND THAT INTO THESE OTHER FACTORS THAT CAN CAUSE THEM. THANK YOU THAT'S A LITTLE MORE REASSURING YES THIS IS FOR THE RE EVALUATION PORTION CAN PRIMARY SHE THE WORKING ON DO YOU THINK YOU THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY FOUR LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THE RE EVALUATION OF THE THE DEEP SEARCH ON DAM SAFETY. OKAY CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING THERE'S A MOTION TO APPROVE AS PROPOSED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ASKING HI JONES [inaudible] REQUIRE [inaudible] MONEY [inaudible] STERN. WE'LL KEEP THAT MATTER OPEN THAT HAS FOUR VOTES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. LITTLE. THE S. SESSION LET'S GO TO TRANSPARENT AND OPEN WATER DATA ACT OF NINE NINE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN GOOD AFTERNOON SURE WORK OWSKI. COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF. I'M COMEY ARGUE VEGGIE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. I OVERSEE. INTEGRATED STATEWIDE WATER MANAGEMENT AND AM IN CHARGE OF IMPLEMENTING DEED OF YOURS PART SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE OTHER REQUEST BEFORE YOU IS FOR OF AN ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND A YEAR FOR FOUR YEARS. OF FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND THAT PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY LET YOU DOWN. HI YES I AND YOU YOU'RE REALLY CUT TO THE CHASE CHAIR -- IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT WE WERE AUTHORIZED OF IT IN A NEW FUND WAS ESTABLISHED THE WATER DATED MINISTRATION FIND AND WE WERE AUTHORIZED THE FUNDING. AND SCOPE OF WORK TO IMPLEMENT AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE AT THAT TIME D. W. R. WAS GIVEN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FROM THE E. L. F. P.. ON AS A BASELINE FUNDING. AND IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT THE BALANCE OF OUR ONE POINT SIX MILLION REQUEST WOULD BE. VOLUNTARILY WOULD BE THROUGH VOLUNTARY DONATIONS TO THIS FUND. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED AND THE REQUESTBEFORE YOU IS NOT BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN THE SCOPE OF WORK OR NEW WORK IT IS TO FILL THAT BUDGET GAP. OF WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT -- ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE FINISH THE STRATEGIC PLAN THE INITIAL PROTOCOLS -- WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO LEVERAGE TO EXISTING OPEN DATA PLATFORMS AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS. AND FEDERATING OR LINKING THEM TOGETHER RATHER THAN GOING OUT AND CREATING A WHOLE NEW I. T. PROJECT SO WE WE HAVE SAY OF THE STATE QUITE A BIT OF MONEY BY LEVERAGING PAST WORK. WE'RE NOW AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE TO ACTUALLY BEGIN PUTTING DATA SETS ON THIS OPEN DATA PLATFORM. AND THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WERE REQUESTING WOULD ENABLE US TO MEET STATUTORY DEADLINES THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR ALL AND THEN SET THE STAGE FOR THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ALLOWING ONGOING MAINTENANCE. IT'S A FIRST FOR ME THAT WE HAVE AN I. T. PROGRAM THAT'S EARLY AND INTEL. CHEAP. FLA OF WHAT. DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THE THE WATER DATA ACT. JUST IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE ANA ANTICIPATED NON STATE FUNDING SOURCES DID MATERIALIZE BUT IT IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE STATE AND BEYOND FORTUNATE TO LOSE THAT PROGRESS WE'VE MADE AND THE BENEFITS IT WOULD YIELD SO SEEMS THIS FUNDING IS NECESSARY. I HAD THAT SAME EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS A CHILD ON CHRISTMAS MORNING JUSTIN FORTUNE SANTA DIDN'T. ANSWER THAT LESS LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER. THIRTY FIVE FOR THE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WATER DATA ACT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ADAM ROBIN WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION PROJECT UP. WE SUPPORT THIS ITEM WE SUPPORT STAFF RECOMMENDATION CURVES YOU TO APPROVE THIS ITEM AS PROPOSED THANK YOU. THERE'S A MOTION. SO MOVED BY CENTER STERN PLEASE CALL ROLL CASKEY HI JONES MCGUIRE. MORNING THANK STERN. WE'LL KEEP THE PROPOSAL. TO OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS AND LET'S GO TO THE URBAN FLOOD RISK REDUCTION ACT WITH HER LITTLE. CHART HERE -- FOR THE ORVILLE WILDLIFE AREA YES I CHECKED YES -- COKE AGAIN -- DEAL BUT DVRS REQUESTING TO MAKE CHANGES TO WHAT WE'RE REGIONAL REQUESTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO MEET THE NEEDS OF INCREASED COSTS. ON ONE OF OUR PROJECT THAT PROJECT BEING -- THE ORAL WILDLIFE AREA WE REGIONAL REQUESTED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. A PROP SIXTY FOR FIVE TO PROJECTS IN TOTAL HOWEVER THE COSTS -- ADORABLE RIGHT WELL LET PROJECT OF INCREASED -- DUE TO UNANTICIPATED BAR MENTAL PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS HIGHER CONSTRUCTION COST AND SCOPE INCREASES TO ADDRESS HYDRAULIC ELEMENTS. THAT WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT. IN MAKING THIS A BETTER PROJECT -- JUST THE SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE OTHER PROJECTS -- THE BUSHY LAKE AND WOULD LIKE PROJECTS -- IN THE REGION REQUEST ARE ARE NOW PART. OF IN WILL BE FUNDED BY THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS -- AS FOR THE FOR FOOTBALL MIDDLE FUNDING THAT WAS RECEIVED LATE LAST YEAR -- IN THE MAIL SHIFTED FROM THE RT SEVENTY PROJECT IS A RELATIVELY MINOR AMOUNT IN COMPARISON TO THE PROJECT OVERALL PROJECT COSTS. THE PROJECT IS STILL IN THE SCOPING FEES AND SO THIS TIME WE DO NOT BELIEVE. THAT THIS PROJECT WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED MOVING FORWARD. THE REQUESTED TO SHIP FIVE POINT ONE EIGHT MILLION OF THE ORIGINAL REQUEST FROM THE THREE OF OF THE PROJECT OVER WILDLIFE AREA PROJECT. BRINGING THE TOTAL COST FOR THE ORAL PROJECT TO EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. HELLO YOU HAVE A OF FILE ON THIS FEATHER RIVER CONNECTIVITY ACTIVE -- PROPOSAL NO CONCERNS. LET'S SEE THIS IS THE PROOF. THIS IS. TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF FROM UP PROP. SIX A SIXTY EIGHT RE DIRECTED. STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS APPROVED HIS PROPOSALS OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING ROOMS AT THE GREATER ORVILLE FEATHER RIVER COMMUNITY HERE. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING MOTION IS TO APPROVE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL CASKEY HI JONES STERN THEY'LL KEEP. A REAL LOOKING FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS IN THIS CALL UP THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD WE HAVE EVALUATION AND APPROVAL OF INNOVATIVE FREE TECHNOLOGY SEVEN POSITIONS [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] EXTENSIVE EVALUATION ATTENTION. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT AFTERNOON. THE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MY CASKET MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM ET CHIANG ON THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. I'M WE HAVE TO MAY REVISED PROPOSALS THAT YOU'LL BE HEARING TODAY BOTH OF THESE ADDRESS DIESEL POLLUTION. WHICH IS THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF AIR TOXICS IN THE STATE AND BOTH OF THEM ALSO INCLUDE FEET COMPONENTS TO ENSURE. THAT AS WE IMPLEMENT -- PROGRAMS WERE DOING SO AND I FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE AND PRUDENT MANNER. SO THIS THE FIRST BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL WERE REQUESTING ONE POINT THREE TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS. FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUNDED FOR SEVEN FULL TIME POSITIONS TO PERFORM APPROVALS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. TO MEET COMMITMENTS WITHIN THE FREIGHT SECTOR -- OUR EXISTING REGULATIONS OUR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRED THAT WE APPROVE THE ZERO EMISSION AND OTHER INNOVATIVE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT QUITE FRANKLY WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THEY WORK BEFORE WE PROVIDE MONEY OR REQUIRE THEM. SO THIS -- APPROVAL IS REQUIRED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE SOUND AND TO PROVIDE COMPLIANCE OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. NOW HISTORICALLY ALMOST ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE THAT WE CERTIFY THEIR COMBUSTION ENGINES TO THEIR COMBUSTION ENGINES FOR CARS FOR TRUCKS FOR OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT. BUT THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE REQUIREMENTS ARE PROGRAMS HAVE SHIFTED AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE MORE ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES AND MORE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES. AND THIS IS WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT OUR COMMITMENT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WITHIN THE FREIGHT SECTOR WERE REALLY EXCITED THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR SHIPS LOCOMOTIVES HARBOR CRAFT CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT. AND TRANSPORTATION REFRIGERATION UNITS. BUT THERE ARE NO ESTABLISH APPROVAL PROCEDURES FOR THESE TYPES OF EQUIPMENT. SO THIS B. C. P. IS GOING TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO DEVELOP. EXCUSE ME NEW APPROVAL PROCEDURES I'M TO SCREENING PROCESS APPLICATIONS FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES MONITOR THERE AND USE IMPROVE PERFORMANCE. AND ALSO LOOK AT CHARGING AND REFUELING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THIS IS BECOMING A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR ZERO MISSION -- EQUIPMENT. THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND WOULD INITIALLY FUND THE POSITIONS UNTIL FEES CAN BE COLLECTED FROM TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE ONGOING SUPPORT. I'M WE'RE GONNA BE PROPOSING A REGULATION ESTABLISHING FEES IN SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS BASED ON NEW WITH FORTY GRANTED AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THROUGH SENATE BILL. EIGHT FIVE FOUR AM WORK REQUESTING THE DISPOSITIONS TO BEGIN IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT USING THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FIND. BECAUSE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE OF APPROVAL PROCEDURES IS GOING TO TAKE A WHILE SEVERAL MONTHS TO A YEAR OR EVEN MORE. I'M WE NEED TO BEGIN APPROVING pINNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I'M WITH THE RIGHT. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE UNDER WAY WE APPRECIATE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE IS BUDGETED AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. LET ME ASK LET ME THINK BY UNDERSTAND THIS WE'RE GOING TO SET FEES [inaudible] ON THE TECHNOLOGY THE THE TECH THE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES ARE COMING OR IS IT COULD BE THE THE FREIGHT. OWNERS THIS WOULD BE THESE ARE CERTIFICATION FEES. THE WEIGHT SO THE WAY THIS WORKS AND THERE BE OF RALPH RELATED CONVERSATION FOR THE NEXT A B. C. P.. IS SO FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS US TO SAY YOU KNOW TO SORT OF GIVE US THEIR STAMP. GIVE US GIVE THEM OUR STAMP OF APPROVAL. THEY WILL. IT REQUIRES A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK ON OUR PART TO THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT FOLKS THAT ARE CERTIFYING THESE TECHNOLOGIES WOULD COVER THOSE COSTS. OKAY AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS. THERE'S I GOT THIS NEW IDEA I GET THIS. THIS GIZMO I THINK IT'S GONNA REDUCE RIGHT AFTER MARVIN BAH BAH BAH BAH BAH AND I COME TO YOU GUYS AND LET'S JUST SAY FOR PURPOSES OF THIS IT WORKS IT REALLY DEBT DOES BUT YOU YOU WANNA TESTED IN INNOVATIVE THEY DON'T PAY. THE CERTIFICATION FEE AT THAT TIME RIGHT WELL SO THE WAY THAT IT WORKS RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T PAY A FEE AT ALL RIGHT NOW SO IN THE FREIGHT SECTOR FOR OFFERED EQUIPMENT. THERE WAS NO UNTIL THAT LEGISLATION WAS PASSED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE IS NO AUTHORITY FOR US TO CHARGE FEES TO CERTIFY FOR OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT. SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IN OUR REGULATION WE SAY OKAY YOU CAN USE THESE INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUES BUT YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW A OR B. HAS TO SAY THAT THEY WORK BEFORE YOU CAN USE IT RIGHT THAT KIND OF MAKES SENSE. AND SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT BUT WE'VE BEEN ABSORBING THOSE COSTS ARE DIVERTING RESOURCES FROM OTHER PLACES. THAT'S THAT'S HOW THEY WORK. HELLO. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE BUDGET REQUEST TO MIMIC WE DID JUST ONE A FLAG ON THE FEE ISSUE IN THIS SHOWS UP IN YOUR NEXT AGENDA ITEM BUT JUST TO KIND OF OF ADDRESS IT NOW I MEAN IT IT IS. IT DOES KIND OF REMOVE A ACCOUNT RIGHT NOW AND THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT CAN BE COLLECTED FROM FEES AND AND THAT THAT APPLIES TO JUST CERTIFICATION. FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT SOURCES NOT JUST THE SPECIFIC ONES WERE TALKING RIGHT HERE I MEAN IN GENERAL WE WE DO THINK THAT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ASSESS FEES ON THE REGULATED ENTITIES. TO COVER THE REGULATORY ACTIVITIES THAT ARE BEING COVERED I WOULD JUST WANNA SORT OF FLAG AT THIS IS. A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES NOT QUITE CLEAR KIND OF EXACTLY HOW MUCH REVENUE WOULD BE NEEDED TO RAISE TO COVER KIND OF ALL THE CERTIFICATION COSTS WITHIN A R. B. AND SO. THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO KIND OF ASK YOU WHAT WHAT CARD KNOWS ABOUT WHAT THOSE COSTS MIGHT BE IN THERE FOR KIND OF WHAT THE AMOUNT OF THE FEE MIGHT BE AND IF THEY DON'T QUITE KNOW AT THIS POINT A WHEN THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT. MIGHT BE ABLE TO KIND OF EXPECT TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE OKAY WHAT TYPE OF FEE WILL THIS. ONE WE KNOW ABOUT IT. SO -- LE I JUST I WANT TO CLARIFY IT SO THE FEES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT ARE RELATED TO THIS PARTICULAR BCP THEY WERE AUTHORIZED -- IN LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO AS I MENTIONED WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH AND DOING SORT OF A MULTI SOURCE HE REGULATION AND THEN FOR THE FREIGHT SECTOR WE HAVE SIX DIFFERENT REGULATIONS THAT ARE COMING UP OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AND AS WE GO THROUGH THAT REGULATORY PROCESS WE'RE GOING TO BE -- DEVELOPING A FEE STRUCTURE AS WE GO THROUGH THAT RULE MAKING SO IT'S AN OPEN PUBLIC PROCESS AS PART OF THE RULE MAKING IT WE'RE STARTING TO DO THE ASSESSMENTS TO LOOK A WHAT THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO DO. WHAT WE WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO SO IT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED AS WE GO ALONG AND AS WE GET TO THE NEXT B. C. P. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE? REMOVAL OF THE CAP. ALRIGHT LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER -- THIRTY SEVEN ONE POINT. THREE TWO SIX FOUR INNOVATIVE FREIGHT TECHNOLOGIES. EVALUATION APPROVAL CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING. IS THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE BUDGET REQUESTS MOTION BY CENTER STERN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I CASKEY BY [inaudible] JONES [inaudible] MCGUIRE. MONNING NAY STERN RIGHT THEY WILL KEEP THE OUR ROLES OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS NOW LET'S GO. TO THE HEAVY DUTY FACE TO GREENHOUSE GAS IMPLEMENTATION AND AUDIT PROGRAM. OKAY BUT A TRAILER LANGUAGE IN THIS P. C. P. WERE REQUESTING ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUNDS. AND TEN POSITIONS THAT PHASE IN OVER THREE YEARS AND THESE POSITIONS ARE TO REVIEW AND CERTIFIED MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY ENGINES AND VEHICLES AND TRAILERS -- TO THE NEWLY ADOPTED CALIFORNIA PHASE TWO GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS SO THESE ARE AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE SECOND PHASE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS STANDARDS THAT WE ADOPTED IN COORDINATION WITH THE US EPA. THESE ARE GONNA REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM HEAVY AND MEDIUM DUTY ENGINES BY ABOUT A THIRD OF BY. TWENTY FIFTY SAID THERE'S TWO MAIN REASONS THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THIS REGULATION. THE ENGINES THAT ARE MEETING THE STANDARD ARE A LOT MORE COMPLEX THAN ENGINES MEETING THE PHASE ONE STANDARD. AND THE DATA AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED IS MUCH GREATER THAN WE PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED AND I'M JUST GONNA SAY FOLKS WAGON WE'RE TRYING TO GET A BETTER HANDLE THEY WERE REQUIRING MORE INFORMATION. SO THE WORKLOAD TO PROCESS THE CERTIFICATIONS IS GOING TO BE MUCH HIGHER -- THESE FACE TO REGULATIONS ALSO INCLUDE FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE GREENHOUSE GAS EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR TRAILERS. AND SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO DEVELOP A WHOLE NEW PROCESS WE'VE NEVER CERTIFIED TRAILERS BEFORE AND SO WE NEED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES FOR OVER A HUNDRED NEW TRAILER CERTIFICATIONS EVERY YEAR. WHAT TYPE OF THE MISSIONS COULD DISK SUBCOMMITTEE EXPECT OFFER THE TRAILERS WELL THIS THAT WHAT THIS IS IS BY HAVING A MORE EFFICIENT TRAILER YOUR REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF FUEL THAT THE TRUCK THE TRACTOR NEEDS TO PULL IT? OKAY THANK IS THAT OKAY. SO AND ACTUALLY I ASKED THEM TO THIS QUESTION -- THEY'RE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEMS AERODYNAMICS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ON THE TRAILERS -- SO THE SECOND REASON THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IS I'M FOR THE PHASE ONE STANDARDS WE BASICALLY SAID IF U. S. E. P. A.'S CERTIFIED YOU TO MEET THE STANDARDS THAN YOU WERE DEEMS TO COMPLY WITH CALIFORNIA STANDARDS. I'M WE'RE TAKING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING THE PHASE TWO STANDARDS AND SO WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING. ON THE REVIEW OF THOSE APPLICATIONS AND DELVING INTO THEM WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS. REGULATION IS IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY. I'M OLDER DIESEL ENGINES ARE RELATIVELY SMALL CONTRIBUTED STE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE STATE'S CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEM PROBLEM. IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET REDUCTIONS FROM EVERY SOURCE I THINK WE'VE TALKED TO THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE ABOUT HOW GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FOR TRANSPORTATION ARE INCREASING. SO WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. AND IN ADDITION IMPLEMENTATION OF PHASE TWO ENGINES IS ALSO GOING TO HELP PRODUCE SMOG FORMING AND TOXIC EMISSIONS FROM THESE ENGINES. NOW WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THIS VCP IS THIS PURPOSE HOSE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. RIGHT NOW THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FINES THAT WE CAN COLLECT FOR OUR ON ROAD CERTIFICATION ACTIVITIES SO THAT'S CARS AND TRUCKS. IS CAPPED AT NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHAT THE TRAILER BILL DOES IS IT REMOVES THE CAP. IT ALLOWS FEE ASSESSMENT FOR THE CERTIFICATION OF TRAILERS AND THAT DIRAC'S THE CERTIFICATION FEES TO A NEW FINDS CALL THE CERTIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE FUND. SO IF THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS APPROVED WE WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS TO ESTABLISH FEES TO COVER THE FACE TO GREENHOUSE GAS PROGRAM. AND OUR OTHER ON RED CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS ON ALL OF THESE RULE MAKING AS WE GO THROUGH OUR NORMAL PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. AND WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES COLLECTED TO BE COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT U. S. EPA'S COLLECTING FOR THEIR CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS. HIS NINE POINT SIX MILLION OR SO WHAT USEPA COLLECTS RIGHTNOW BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AND THIS IS FOR ALL OF THEIR CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS FOR ON ROAD OFF ROAD LOCOMOTIVES EVERYTHING THAT THEY CERTIFY. IS ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WHAT'S THE SIZE THAT FEE COULD BE. YOU KNOW SO IT IT REALLY DEPENDS COVERS THE COST NATURALLY YEAH I KNOW IT'S IN IT'S INTENDED TO COVER THE COSTS AND I I THINK THAT. YOU THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO ASSESS THAT FEE AND HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU ASSIGN THAT FEATURE THE DIFFERENT FOLKS THAT ARE APPLYING FOR CERTIFICATION AND SOME OF THE -- SOME OF THE SOURCES ARE GONNA BE QUITE SMALL SO PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING. BY PEOPLE WHO ARE CERTIFYING LIKE AFTERMARKET PARTS THEY MIGHT BE MKING ONLY A FEW HUNDRED OF THEM -- FOLKS THAT ARE -- CERTIFYING ENGINES FOR CARS ARE AN ENGINE FAMILY FOR CARS MIGHT BE SELLING MILLIONS OF THEM AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AS WE GO THROUGH THAT PUBLIC RULE MAKING PROCESS IS TO SET UP. A STRUCTURE FOR THE RULE THAT MAKES SENSE AND WORKS SO THAT'S I THINK PART OF THE PUBLIC PROCESS -- IF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS APPROVED ALLEY ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THAT. YEAH I MEAN I I THINK THEY'RE STILL YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S STILL QUITE A QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND KIND OF EGGMAN THE EXACT COSTS BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE KIND OF A GENERAL RANGE FOR WHAT THEY EXPECT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUDGET DOLLAR RANGE YEAH EXACTLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IN THE REQUESTED RESOURCES WE THINK THE THE RESOURCES REQUEST IS REASONABLE GIVEN THE THEY IDENTIFIED WORKLOAD? ALRIGHT THIS IS SAID. ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY EIGHT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS. TO PROVE HIS PROPOSED LET'S OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING THERE'S A MOTION BY CENTER MINING PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CASKEY HI JONES [inaudible] MCGUIRE [inaudible] MORNING [inaudible] STERN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD LUCK. ALL THE THINGS I BROUGHT UP A ALL LETTERS I KEEP READING GUYS THAT'S LET'S MOVE -- TO DGSE. THIS IS COST RECOVERY MANAGE. MEN SYSTEM INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT. SPLITTING THE MONEY BETWEEN THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT AND THE TAXES SUBSTANCE CONTROL AND IMPROVING THE SITUATION. HELLO THIS IS. THIRTY NINE SO -- THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION [inaudible] WHICH IS. TO BE MORE CLEAR OF WHAT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO PROVIDE PROOF APPROVALS PROPOSED AND ADOPT THE B. B. L.. AT THAT WOULD MAKE. THE RELEASE OF TWO MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THE REQUESTED FUNDING CONTINGENT ON ONE APPROVAL OF STAGE FOR PAL DOCUMENTS BUYS AS CDT. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND TO WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. THAT THE PROJECT HAS RECEIVED. THAT THESE APPROVAL SO IT'S RELEASING SOME HOLDING BACK. OTHERS. THAT'S THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD UPPER VACATION GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR I CASKEY AND AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HI MEREDITH WILLIAMS ACTING DIRECTOR FOR DTS SEE. AND OF OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FRANCESCA NEGRI WILL PRESENT THIS PARTICULAR. SO THANK YOU -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY AND WE AS YOU KNOW WE'RE REQUESTING NO ONE ONE TIME AUGMENTATION OF TWO POINT SIX MILLION SPLIT BETWEEN AGE TO BE SEEING TOSCA -- FOR THE COST RECOVERY MANAGEMENT IT PLATFORM UPGRADE PROJECT -- UPGRADING OF THIS PLATFORM IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE THE EXISTING SYSTEM THE DTS HE USES FOR ITS COST RECOVERY ACTIVITIES IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED CANNOT BE UPGRADED TO ME TO CHANGE IN THE STATUTES AND IS SUBJECT TO SECURITY THREATS. DID YOU SEE RECOVERS MILLIONS AND RESPONSE COSTS ANNUALLY FROM RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND PERMITTED HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES AND THE COST RECOVERY BILLING SYSTEM SUPPORTS THESE ACTIVITIES. WE'VE CHOSEN A A SOLUTION THAT PROVIDES A COST EFFECTIVE KNOWN STRATEGY MEETS LEGISLATIVE COST RECOVERY INTEREST RATE MNDATES OF AB TWO SEVENTY THREE AND ALIGNS WITH CALLIE PEES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGIC PLAN TO LEVERAGE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY. AND SOLUTIONS. THE PLANNING PHASE WHICH IS STAGE FOR THE PROJECT APPROVAL LYSAGHT CYCLE WHICH IS PAL IS ESTIMATED TO BE COMPLETED BY AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO IN A FEW MONTHS. PROJECT TIMELINES INCLUDE EXECUTING A CONTRACT IN AUGUST TWENTY NINETEEN TO BEGIN UPGRADING THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. WE APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATION TO PROVE AS PROPOSED AND ADOPT THE BILL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE THE RELEASE OF FUNDS CONTINGENT UPON TO POP TO PARTNER AFTER TECHNOLOGY AND FINANCE APPROVAL. BUT WOULD ASK THAT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR THOUSAND BE IMMEDIATELY APPROVED FOR THE COMPLETION OF STAGE. FOR WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO BE COMPLETED IN AUGUST. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL TO US I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT IF IT WAS MAY OF TWO THOUSAND NINE THAT YOU WERE COMING BEFORE US BURKE. ALEJO WE LIKED YOUR LANGUAGE ON YOUR RECOMMENDATION. IF YOU HEARD I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SUMMER WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHERE YOU READ EARLIER IMPLEMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RECOMMENDATION. OKAY WE THINK WERE TAKEN I GOT BIG PLANS FOR PTSD. NOT ON THIS THIS IS LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE [inaudible] OUTSIDE ARM. THIS IS SUDDEN. YOU HEARD THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION NOT TO READ IT AGAIN LET'S OPEN PUBLIC HEARING. COST RECOVERY MANAGEMENT. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING THERE SIR. RECOMMENDATION AS AMENDED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MY COUNTY HI JONES [inaudible] REQUIRE [inaudible] MONEY. ALL RIGHT ISSUE NUMBER FORTY IS. WE ARE FIX IT. BASED FUNDING TO MAINTAIN OUR OPERATIONS THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION BUCKS TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING OPERATIONS AND IS YOUR BASE FUNDING WE'RE GOING TO ADD TO THE MOTION SO THE MOTION. IS. APPROVE -- AS PROPOSED WITH PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SECRETIVE FEET TASK FORCE AND IMPLEMENT OTHER CHANGES TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND WE WILL. CLARIFY THAT WE'RE GOING TO APPROVE TWENTY SEVEN POINT FIVE TO BACK FILL THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACT. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TWENTY AND ADOPT THE PLACEHOLDER. TO CREATE A TASK FORCE. AT FEET TASK FORCE ANOTHER CHANGES TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY DEPARTMENT EVERY JACK. EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO COME BACK NEXT YEAR. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION GO AHEAD. OKAY I WANT TO FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE FUNDING SUPPORT AND OVERSIGHT BY THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL HAS ENABLED US TO AND IDENTIFY SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND MAKE INROADS INTO ADDRESSING THEM. WITH THE LOAN TO SUPPORT THE X. I. CLEAN UP WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CLEAN UP ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED HOMES AND PROPERTIES. THE FINDINGS OF THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL HELP TO SHAPE OUR STRATEGY FOR THE UPCOMING YEARS. AND THE FIND THE FUNDING TO IMPROVE PERMITTING PROCESSES HAS ENABLED US TO MAKE MORE TIMELY AND ENFORCEABLE PERMITTING DECISIONS. AND I COULD GO ON BUT I'LL GET TO THE POINT WHICH IS UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT'S LONG STANDING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT HAS REACHED A POINT WHERE WE MUST RELY ON GENERAL FUND MONIES. THE TWENTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MEN GENERAL. TWENTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND BACK FILL FOR FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AND THE REQUESTED EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING TWO FISCAL YEARS. WOULD GIVE US TIME TO WORK WITH YOU THE GOVERNOR AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOLUTIONS. THISREQUEST ALSO ENABLES US TO ACHIEVE GREATER BUDGET TRANSPARENCY AND INCLUDES THE ELIMINATION OF THE GENERAL FUND LOAN REPAID PAYMENT. FROM THE LEAD ACID BATTERY CONTROL FUND. FREEING THOSE REVENUES TO BE USED FOR CLEANING CONTAMINATED SITES AROUND THE FORMER LEAD ACID BATTERY FACILITIES. WHEN WE WERE BEFORE YOU IN JANUARY WE UPDATED YOU ON OUR EFFORTS TO GET OUR FINANCIAL HOUSE IN ORDER? WE DISCUSSED THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING ACCURATE INFORMATION ON BUDGET AND WORKLOAD WHICH UP UNTIL THAT POINT HAD PROVED ELUSIVE. TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF ANY FEE REFORMS. I'M SORRY TO TO RICHARD ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF ANY FEE REFORMS WE'VE MADE FURTHER PROGRESS ON OUR FISCAL GOVERNANCE WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS INCLUDING FIST GALLON STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO STAY ON TRACK FOR AN ON TIME HEARING CLOSING. AND OUR ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES AUDIT IS UNDER WAY. WE'RE CONTINUE OUR WORK WORKLOAD STUDY AND WILL SOON RELEASE A STRATEGIC PLAN WITH PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS PROGRAMS. COLLECTIVELY THESE EFFORTS WILL PROVIDE THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF FUNDING REQUIRED TO DELIVER OUR MISSION. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE FOUNDATIONAL. TO THE WORK OF A FEW TASK FOR FORCE PER THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION. WE ARE COMPUTER COLLABORATING WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DETERMINE WHAT ORGANIZATIONAL AND FISCAL REFORMS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE DEPARTMENT EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PROVIDES ADEQUATE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AGAINST TOXIC SUBSTANCES. LA -- YOUR COMMENT ON THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. WE AGREE WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PER THE REQUEST FOR TWENTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION. FOR THE BUDGET YEAR BUT REJECT THAT THE REQUEST FOR EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO MINUTES IN RECENT YEARS TEACHES HIS BEEN THE FOCUS OF A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IN HEARING. TO DO THAT FISCAL AN OPERATIONAL ISSUES -- WE THINK APPROVING ONLY ONE YEAR OF THE GENERAL FUND BACK FAN WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND ASK FOR DEBT TIONAL FUND. AND THAT WILL ENSURE ON GOING CONTINUE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT. THIS OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER. THIRTY NO FORTY ON THE BASE FUNDING. AT TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS IF THE TSC PLEASE COME FORWARD. HI MORGAN CAM BEHALF OF THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN SUPPORT OF THIS ITEM THANK YOU. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING. THERE'S A MOTION BY SENATE MCGUIRE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WE CASTING HI JONES [inaudible] REQUIRE [inaudible] MONEY. WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOOD AND AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT. THIS IS CATASTROPHIC LIVESTOCK DISEASE. VERY -- VERLOREN. NEW CASTLE THE TEAS V. N. D.. OUTBREAKS IN SAN BERNARDINO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES. PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON SURE WHITE HOUSE CAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KEVIN MÃ¡S WHO ARE A DEPUTY SECRETARY OVER CDFA AND WITH ME IS DOCTOR JONES. WHO IS ACCESSORIZED BALLS IN THE V. AND D. OUTBREAK -- AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION IT'S VERY FAST MOVING IN A VERY DEVASTATING DISEASE OF POULTRY IT AFFECTS BROILERS AN EGG LAYERS. RIGHT NOW IT'S PRIMARILY AND BACKYARD FLOCKS AND A WHAT YOU CALL SAID SEMI RESIDENTIAL AREAS RATCHETS IN AREAS LIKE THAT. BUT IT HAS MOVED INTO A SMALL LAYING FLOCKS IMPOLITE RANCHES DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HOW WE KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED WE HAVE HAD? FIND AFTER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT IT WAS ISOLATED IN IT DIDN'T SPREAD TO THE BROILER INDUSTRY. WERE ASKING FOR THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN THREE POINT TWO ONE GOING IN TWENTY THREE POSITIONS. SO THAT WE CAN BETTER -- PUT TOGETHER A TEAM TO WORK ON PREVENTION OF FUTURE DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND A MORE RAPID IN ROBUST RESPONSE WHEN THESE DISEASE OUTBREAKS TO HAPPEN SO THAT WE CAN CONTAIN THEM FAR QUICKER. AND ALSO CONTAINED WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL IS SOME STAFF WHO DO SIMILAR FUNCTIONS BUT THEN THEY WILL BE FOCUSED ON ANIMAL CARE ISSUES DURING CATASTROPHIC EMERGENCY EVENTS. SUCH AS WHAT WE EXPERIENCED DURING THE RECENT CAMPFIRE -- BUT IN TWO YEARS AGO AS WELL IN CINEMA COUNTY CENTER MCGUIRE. WITH ANIMAL CARE ISSUES THAT COME UP WITH PEOPLE HAVING TO EVACUATE MOVE THOSE ANIMALS AND THEN BEING DISPLACED ON A LONG TERM BASIS. AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE PUT THAT IN THIS PROPOSAL IS SOME OF THE SAME SKILL SETS ARE FUNCTIONAL TO BOTH TYPES OF OPERATIONS. AND SO WE FELT IT WAS A GOOD USE OF RESOURCES TO PUT THESE TEAMS TOGETHER TRAIN THEM UP IN PREVENTION TRAINING WORKING WITH LOCALS ON PLANTS. AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND BUT TO SET THE BASIC CORE UNDERSTAND ANIMAL CARE ISSUES. IN AND THAT WAY WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEPLOY THESE PEOPLE DURING DISEASE OUTBREAKS AS WELL AS EMERGENCY OUTBREAKS. QUITE A FEW OF THE MEMBERS OF THE TEAMS ARE INSPECTORS SO I SEE LET'S JUST PICK THE EUTHANASIA TEAM THE YOU'VE GOT. A SENIOR LIVESTOCK INSPECTOR IN FOR LIVESTOCK INSPECTORS AND THEN ONE VETERINARIAN AYE I THINK I GET WITH THE VETERINARIAN DOES SO YOU'VE GOT THESE FIVE ON THE TEAM. BUT THE OTHER THE FIELD REIMBURSEMENT [inaudible] SPECIALIST HAS. ONE OF THE QUARANTINE ENFORCEMENT HAS. OF INSPECTORS THE DISEASE DETECTION HAS INSPECTORS THOSE INSPECTORS. THEY JUST STAY ON THE EUTHANASIA CHAMBER TODAY ARE THEY ABLE OF A ORTABLE TO THESE OTHER QUARANTINE INVESTIGATIONS. YOU KNOW THESE OTHER. FUNCTIONS I'M ALL I CAN ADDRESS I AM SO I MATCH I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT KIND OF GETS TO IT ONE OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES ON HOW WE PREPARED TO RESPOND. WE USE THE MODEL THAT A LOT OF THAT -- YES USES A LOT OF FIRE FIRE POLICE AND WE TRYING TO BE MORE OF AN ALL HAZARDS ORGANIZATION BUT WITHIN THAT WE HAVE TO IN BED SPECIALTIES. SO WHAT WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WE HAVE A GAP WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO AND AND ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE'S NO WEATHER WILL OTHER AGENTS HERE OTHER RESOURCE THAT HAS THAT SPECIALTY. SO WE WOULD EXPECT THOSE STAFF LIKE THE ONES THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED TO BE OUR STATE EXPERTS IN THOSE AREAS AND PART OF THEIR JOB WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR STAFF HAS A LEVEL PURSE PROFICIENCY IN THOSE AREAS. SO THAT WE CAN MIX AND MATCH AND MOVE AT PEOPLE TO WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE NEEDED BECAUSE YOU REALLY HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD THERE IS NO RESPONSE IS EXACTLY THE SAME FROM LOCATION EQUATION DISEASE THE DISEASE DISASTER TO DISASTER -- BUT THOSE WERE JUST CLEAR GAPS THAT WE BECAME UNFORTUNATELY A PAINFULLY AWARE OF OVER THE PAST YEAR SO YOU ANTICIPATE DOCTOR THAT THE THAT THAT INSPECTOR. HE GOT A VERY LEARNED. NEWCASTLE DISEASE OUTBREAKS THEY WOULD BE THAT THE INSPECTOR WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY I NEED TO GET THE QUARANTINE TEAM MANNER I NEED. TO TAKE A TO TAKE THESE ACTIONS OR WE NEED TO EUTHANIZE THIS THIS IS THIS IS WHATEVER THE STATUS IS RIGHT RIGHT SO THEY WOULD PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP THAT WE WOULD NEED. TO WHEN AS WE BRING OTHER PEOPLE ON BOARD SO FOR EXAMPLE ON OUR CURRENT OUTBREAK WE USE A LOT OF TEMPORARY HIRES OR OR OF PEOPLE FROM OTHER AGENCIES THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE EXPERTISE SO WE WOULD ACTUALLY. PROBABLY THAT TEAM WOULDN'T FUNCTION EXACTLY AS A TEAM IS DESCRIBED BUT RATHER THEY'D BE BROKEN UP IN BE PROVIDE LEADERSHIP ROLES -- AS WE BRING NEW PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE SURE I MEAN YOU YOU MENTIONED EUTHANASIA THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DO CORRECTLY. AND HAS THE WEB BASED TRACKER AT THAT I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE END. DE AND TRACKING BUT IS THAT THE YOU ANTICIPATE THAT SOMETIME THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO KNOW. I'M IN SAN BERNADINO AND THEN IT GOES UP WHAT'S MORE THE SAN BERNADINO KNOWS RIGHT SAN JOAQUIN. AS IT GOES THROUGH THESE COUNTIES IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE. THAT THAT DATA THAT INFORMATION SO THE THE CHICKEN. FARMER AS A FARMER OR RANCHER WHATEVER THEY ARE [inaudible] SO. ADLER GET TO KNOW ABOUT IT. THESE OUTBREAKS THERE ARE -- VERY DATA INTENSIVE AND DATA DRIVEN JUST LIKE WHEN OUR HUMAN COUNTERPARTS ARE DEALING WITH YOU KNOW HUMAN OUTBREAKS OF VARIOUS DISEASES SO -- WE WE DO USE A FAIRLY ROBUST DATABASE THAT TO TRACK -- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT INFORMATION WE USE THAT TO MAKE COUNTERMEASURE DECISIONS -- WE WE DO A LOT OF SURVEILLANCE SO WHICH IF IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR AS FAR AS TRACKING THE STATUS OF DISEASE -- SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIAGNOSTICS AND TESTING THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE STAFF STAFF ACTUALLY INVENTED -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE MOST OF OUR STAFF OUR FIELD STAFF BECAUSE THIS EXPERTISE DOESN'T EXIST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU KNOW FOR THE MOST PART SO THEY'RE EMBEDDED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENSURE. WE DON'T HAVE AND IT'S NOT JUST THIS ONE DISEASE OR SEVERAL DISEASES TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN DISEASE INCURSIONS. AND FINALLY ON THE I'M FROM TAKE IN THE BACKYARD. OKAY ALL WHO HAVE THREE OR FOUR CHICKENS OR TWO I GUESS WHATEVER IT IS IS THE IS THIS OUT OF REACH. PER CENTER THAT'S GONNA GO IN HOW WHAT A SECOND LOOK LIKE WHAT DO YOU ENVISION THAT THAT IT LOOKING LIKE RIGHT ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION AND THEN THE DEMOGRAPHICS FOR PEOPLE THAT REYES WHAT. WERE ONCE CONSIDERED FARM ANIMALS IS CERTAINLY SHIFTING WHICH IS KIND OF A GOOD THING I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE A EXISTING. BUT SO REACHING THEM IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND WE USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND KIND OF BECAUSE EVEN YOU CAN SELL YOU CAN TELL THE RESOURCES REQUEST HERE IS PROBABLY NOT ADEQUATE TO REACH EVERY. POULTRY OWNER IN THE STATE SO WHAT WE WE USE A SYSTEM OF LEVERAGING OTHER RESOURCES SO FEED STORES ARE ONE GREAT EXAMPLE OF OF PLACES WE TRY AND LEVERAGE THE MESSAGE. OF THAT PRIVATE VETERINARIANS ARE REALLY OUR EYES AND EARS SO WE DO A LOT OF INTEGRATION WITH THEM COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. OF DIFFERENT BIRD CLUBS THAT TYPE OF THING. ALL TO QUESTION. DO I HAVE A TRANSYLVANIAN A CONNECTS AND POST OP AT SO IT'S GOOD STUFF ACCORDING TO BE VISITING. UP BUT HATE AT IT'S TRUE -- A FEW QUESTIONS ON ISSUES A DISASTER WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS IN ON SO -- THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS. PRIOR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE NEVER THOUGHT. HOW MANY HAD A LIVESTOCK ACTUALLY COMING OUT DURING A THESE WILDFIRE VETS WERE TALKING THOUSANDS? OF WHETHER THEIR HORSES BACK YOU IN CATTLE SHEEP EXEDRA -- AND IN MANY THESE RURAL COUNTIES YOU TO BE PROPPED UP. I AND HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS ABLE TO BE ON SITE. AND WORK WITH LOCALS IS THAT HOW YOU IN TENNESSEE DUE. TO MOVE ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF DISASTER OR DO YOU. BRING. FOR THE TEAM MEMBERS AND TO BE ABLE TO BE THERE AND STAFF CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THE YEAH THE CORE MODEL IS IS TO HAVE THE APPARATUS IN PLACE SO THAT WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY FOR TRAINING. BUT ALSO WHEN WE'RE NOT IN IN A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH LOCALS PERFORMING YEAH REACH DUTIES TO FORM THE RELATIONSHIPS AND HELP THEM TO DEVELOP THEIR PLANS. UPDATE THEIR PLANS MAKE SURE THEY HAVE UPDATED RESOURCE LIST SO THAT EVERYTHING'S READY TO GO IN IN TRAINING IS A KEY COMPONENT SO THE LOCAL SINCE ARE ALREADY THERE CAN REACT VERY QUICKLY. AND THEN THE IDEA IS IS OUR PEOPLE CAN COME IN AND SIMILARLY TO WHAT DOCTOR JONES DESCRIBED IN AN ANIMAL DISEASE OF BAD WHERE YOU HAVE KEY PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED UP WITH THE SKILL SETS. THEN THEY CAN QUICKLY ASSUME LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND TRAIN LOCALS ARE VOLUNTEERS OR OTHER PEOPLE FROM SAY OUR DEPARTMENT OR OTHER DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE READY TO GO BUT THEY NEED THAT SPECIALIZED TRAINING TO TELL THEM AND DIRECT THEM ON WHAT TO DO SO IT'S LEVERAGING ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT RESOURCES. WITH THE CORE TEAM. THEY ADD TO THEIR AB IN ANOTHER A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND THE DISASTERS THAT ACTOR USES SIZE I AGREE THE SAME SKILL SETS IS. OF FOR DISASTERS THERE'S A A REALLY WONDERFUL NETWORK OF VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS WITH VERY HIGH LEVELS OF SKILL. BUT A LOT OF THE TIMES THE PROBLEM IS THE GAP IS ACTUALLY COORDINATING THEM WITH THE LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS WHEN EVERYBODY'S PRESSED YOU KNOW TO SAVE LIVES SO WHAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATED ARE. THOSE FEW THAT WE HAVE A FEW LEADERS WITHIN THAT PROGRAM THAT THEIR NUMBER ONE JOB WOULD BE TO PULL TOGETHER THESE -- DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE GREAT RESOURCES THAT COULD BE APPLIED DURING A DISASTER SO THEY WOULD MAINTAIN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AS RESOURCE WE HAVE LESS MAYBE WORK ON MUTUAL AID WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND THEN DURING A DISASTER THEY WOULD GO INTO THOSE COORDINATION ROLES THAT YOU KIND OF REFERRED TO AND THEY WOULD TAP IN TO BOTH OUR DEPARTMENT FOR OUR RESOURCES AS WELL AS ALL OF THESE NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS BUT IN THOSE NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE JUST BEEN GUIDES. AND RIGHT AT THE NAY -- YEAH BUT THERE IS A GAP OF THREE TO FIVE DAYS -- WHERE IS COMPLETE CHAOS RIGHT UP FOLKS LEAVE AND THEN THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET BACK TO BE ABLE TO FEED I MEAN THERE'S JUST? A VARIETY OF COMPLICATIONS. AND WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THE BUDGET THIS YEAR BUT AT CITY OF PHASE RT ON IT AND JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY. THANK YOU TO THE SECRETARY UP FOR ALL THE WORK ON THIS I ALSO THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE BRING THIS FOR NATO CAROLING THIS HERE -- AS SEEN THIS FIRSTHAND AS WELL AND I'M SURE AS WE TALK ON THIS BUT HE'S VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS IS THIS IS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST GAPS THAT WE HAVE WHEN IT COMES A DISASTER AND IT QUICKLY OVERWHELMS A SMALL COUNTY -- AND WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT HOUSE PETS RIGHT WHICH IS ALSO ANOTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE NEED. TO HAVE FOR THE COMPETITION FROM THE LIVESTOCK IT HAS BEEN HUGE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO GET THE FEET FROM THE BILL TO FEED AS WE SAW DURING THE FIRE. AT THE VALLEY FIRE SEVEN FIFTY HORSES -- THAT WERE ALL EVACUATED IN THAT WAS -- HI MISS. SO THIS WAS A THANK YOU. LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS A ISSUE NUMBER FORTY ONE THE DEPARTMENT OF OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE'S CATASTROPHIC LIVESTOCK. DISEASE PREVENTION EMERGENCY RESPONSE GO AHEAD. MATTIE MUNSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA POULTRY FEDERATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT FUNDING THANK YOU. KAREN LAYING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL OF HER CESSATIONS REPRESENTS ALL THE PUBLIC PRIVATE SHELTERS IN CALIFORNIA A TO CENTER MAGUIRE'S POINT. OF VIEW COUNTY IT WAS IT WAS A TREMENDOUS OF AND AND IT REALLY OF BURN SOME OF MY MEMBERS THAT. AND SO WE WOULD -- THINK CDFA SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION FOR INCLUDING IT. IN ORDER PRIVILEGED THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO SPCA IN THE SAN DIEGO HUMANE SOCIETY SOCIETY ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THAT THE CARE SPENDING THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING. THERE'S A MOTION BY SENATOR -- THE MINING TWO PROOFS. OF THE RECOMMENDATION AS PROPOSED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ASKING HI JONES. REQUIRE. MONEY. STERN. KELLY THE VOTES CLOSE ROLL THE EYES HAVE A FIVE ZERO ISSUE NUMBER. FORTY TWO PRODUCE SAFETY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. YEAH THE DEPARTMENTS ARE PROPOSING SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING IN ONE POSITION. TO DEVELOP OF PRODUCE SAFETY TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND EDUCATION TO ASSIST CALIFORNIA'S PRODUCE FARMERS. AND THAT IS SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER COMPLY WITH THE FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT WHICH IS CARRIED OUT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- THE RESOURCES THAT WILL USE WILL BE A SENIOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS THAT WILL WORK OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT BUT WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. TO LEVERAGE THAT NETWORK TO GET OUT THERE AND PROVIDE THESE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES DIRECTLY TO THE GROWERS. A MEASURE WHERE FOOD SAFETY WE'VE HD QUITE A FEW HIGH PROFILE INCIDENTS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SOME OF THEM GARNER A LOT OF PROGRESS. ON THAT ACTUALLY THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING GOING ON SOME OF THEM JUST DON'T RISE TO THE LEVEL WHERE WE GET A LOT OF PRESS. BUT IT DOES POINT TO THE ISSUE THAT -- FARM PRODUCTS DO NEED -- HIGH LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION WHEN IT COMES TO HOW THEY'RE HANDLED PRODUCED AND ENTERED INTO THE MARKETING CHANNELS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE FOOD SAFETY. AND WE RECENTLY STARTED DOING OUR ON FARM VISITS WITH FTA AS PART OF THE PRODUCE A FIFTY RULE IMPLEMENTATION. IN AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE CALIFORNIA HAS A MYRIAD OF DIFFERENT SIZE AND SOPHISTICATION LEVELS OF FARM SIZES AND A DIFFERENT TYPES OF CROPS AND COMMODITY GROUNDS IN EACH ONE PROVIDES. A VERY UNIQUE CHALLENGES ON HOW DO YOU MAXIMIZE FOOD SAFETY WITH YOUR PRACTICES. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN HEARING BACK FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT SOURCES THAT THERE'S A BIG NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SO THAT THESE GROWERS CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE COMPLIANCE ISSUE BUT THIS REALLY ISN'T JUST ABOUT SAYING OKAY GOING TO HELP YOU COMPLY SO YOU STAY OUT OF ROUBLE. IT'S ABOUT HELPING YOU COMPLY SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE A SAFE FOOD SYSTEM AND SUSTAIN THAT SAFETY THROUGH THEIR PRACTICES. YOU EXPECT TO WORK BETWEEN WITH THE COUNTY -- ADMINISTRATORS ON AHEAD ON THIS OR YOU GET A DO SITE VISITS TO SEE THIS COULD BE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT. YOU KNOW UP THE CROP BOB OF EXTENSION WORKS LOCALLY WITH GROWERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTION TYPE ISSUES AND HELPS THEM SO THIS WOULD PROVIDE THAT'S WHY WE WOULD WANT TO GO INTO THAT NETWORKING GIVE OUT -- CONTRACT MONEY FOR THEM TO DEVELOP EXPERTISE IN A SPECIFIC AREAS IN AND THEY WOULD BE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND BUT WE STILL WOULD HAVE THE SCIENTISTS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER AT THE DEPARTMENT. TO PROVIDE THAT COORDINATION AND THAT STATE LEVEL PERSPECTIVE AND TO BE THAT CLEARING HOUSE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN AN IMPORTANT BRIDGE BETWEEN -- FDA AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND COMING INTO CALIFORNIA WITH US BUT ALSO A DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IS ALSO A PARTNER IN THIS EFFORT. TO SO IT'S KIND OF A MULTI PRONGED EFFORT HERE. I SHOULD KNOW THIS BUT I DON'T IS THERE SOME NEWSLETTER THAT YOU GUYS PUT OUT THAT SAYS YOU KNOW. ALMOND GROWERS HERE'S THE LATEST. FOOD SAFETY DEAL YOU GUYS GIVE OUT NEWSLETTERS AT TIMES ARE NOW. GET SAID MAY PUT ALERTS HAVE NATALIE DO WE DO NOW -- NATALIE CRAP GRANBERG OF INSPECTION SERVICES SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO HAVE ON OUR PRODUCE SAFETY PROGRAM AS A BLOG SITE AND SO WE DO PUSH OUT INFORMATION RELATIVE TO UPDATES -- BUT WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS PARTNERED WITH OUR VARIOUS COMMODITY GROUPS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY'VE HELPED US REACH THEIR MEMBERSHIP UP AND DOWN THE STATE. THAT'S A RATHER THAN THE EMERGENCY L. ELLIE -- YOU HAVE A FOOD SAFETY. WE HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THIS PROPOSAL GOTCHA. OKAY -- THIS IS STEP FOR CONDITIONS TO APPROVE IS A PROPOSED. LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IN MOTION BY SENATOR STERN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ASKING HI JONES [inaudible] REQUIRE. YEP BUT MONEY THANK [inaudible] STERN. OKAY IN OUR LAST BUT NOT LEAST LET'S HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATIONS JOIN THAT FOOD IN. AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT FOR THIS. JOINT EFFORT AT TRANSITIONING TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS PARDON -- YES. TELL US ABOUT EXECUTIVE ORDER SHOULD THE THE NUMBER. NOW GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY I'M THERESA MARKS IN THE ACTING DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. THE DEPARTMENT PESTICIDE REGULATIONS MISSION IS TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT BY REGULATING PESTICIDES SALES AND YOU SAY MY FOSTERING REDUCE RISK PEST MANAGEMENT. I DPR ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE REQUEST RESOURCES TO ASSIST WITH THE TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE. PEST MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS THE CIVIC WE DPR REQUESTS TWO MILLION TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND GENERAL FUND ONE TIME MANY TO CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE PEST MANAGEMENT RESEARCH GRANT PROGRAM AND TO FACILITATE ACROSS SECTOR WORK GROUP. THAT WILL IDENTIFY VALUE WHITE AND DEVELOP SAFER PRACTICAL MORE SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS FOR CALIFORNIA GROWERS. LAST WEEK AS YOUR PROBABLY AWARE TO PROTECT WORKERS PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT WE ANNOUNCED THAT CALIFORNIA'S BANNING OR GOING TO INITIATE PROCEDURES TO BANGOR PEER FOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF PESTICIDE USE TO CONTROL A VARIETY OF INSECTS ON MORE THAN SIXTY CROPS. AS CALIFORNIA MOVES TO IN THE USE OF CORE PAIR FOSS WE'RE TAKING A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE PRACTICAL AND SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THE FUNDING WILL HELP CREATE A CROSS SECTOR WORKING GROUP TO EVALUATE RECOMMEND AND ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVES. INCLUDING THE USE OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS AND OTHER INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THE P. R. REQUEST TWO POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND ONE TIME MANY TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR PROJECTS THAT DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THAT REDUCE PESTICIDE RISK TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL BE USED TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO CORPORATE FAUCET ADVANCE CYBER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. THIS APPROACH WILL HELP IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVES THAT CAN BE PRACTICALLY IMPLEMENTED IN THE SHORT TERM ALSO DEVELOPING LONG TERM SOLUTIONS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. AND I'LL LET CDFA ADDRESS. THEIR PART OF THE PROGRAM AND I HAVE A CLARIFICATION IS THE FIVE POINT SEVEN AND CHANGE. IS THAT JUST FOR PEST MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES TO SIMPLY CORPORATE. FOR CLICK HERE AEROPRESS FOSS. OR IS IT ALL PEST MANAGEMENT -- ALTERNATIVES IT'S KIND OF A DUAL PROCESS WHAT WE INTEND TO DO WHEN WE BEGIN THIS THE THE AS TASK FORCE WILL BE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES TO CORPORATE FALSE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR FIRST ROUND -- SO THE THE ALTERNATIVE IS THE RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FUNDING WE WILL BE AT DPR DEVOTING THOSE TWO ALTERNATIVES TO CORPORATE FOSS. SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT MAYBE FOR THAT WHY NOW WE'RE HOPING THIS IS GOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT. AND IT WILL BE ABLE TO PERHAPS COME AGAIN NEXT YEAR AND TALK ABOUT CONTINUING SOME OF THE WORK OF THIS WORKGROUP TO LOOK AT THE OTHER MORE TOXIC ALTERNATIVES AND HOW WE MIGHT GO ABOUT DEVELOPING. SAFER MORE MANAGEABLE ALTERNATIVES CAM [inaudible] OKAY. WITH DRUG WE GOT WE GOT THE BAN ON CLERK -- FOSS NOW WE HAVE. ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS YEAH AND OUR COMPONENT IN THEIR ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN ONE TIME WILL ACTUALLY AUGMENT FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND THAT WAS APPROVED IN GENERAL FUND FOR THIS YEAR ON GOING. AND THEN ALSO WE DO HAVE A REQUEST IN FOR BUDGET YEAR FOR AG FUND A SORTIE FOR ANOTHER -- SLIGHTLY MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN A GOES TO IS CALLED I ARE FOR WHICH IS ADMINISTERED BY THE USDA. AND WITH THAT PROGRAM DOES IT LOOKS TO FIND ALTERNATIVE PESTICIDES FOR SPECIALTY CROP GROWERS TO REPLACE SOME OF THESE ONES LIKE CHLORPYRIFOS. THAT ARE EITHER BEING DE REGISTERED OR FOR WHATEVER REASON BECOMING SO ESTRICTIVE TO USE WITH PERMIT CONDITIONS THAT IT'S NOT A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR THE SPECIALLY CROP GROWERS. I JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW SPECIALLY CROP SOMETIMES DON'T GARNER THE ATTENTION FOR MANUFACTURERS OF SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS THERE LESS. TOXIC IN THE ENVIRONMENT LESS IMPACTFUL TO WORKERS AND OTHERS THAT COME IN CONTACT WITH THEM. SIMPLY BECAUSE OF NUMBERS BECAUSE OF LOW AMOUNT OF ACREAGE AND WEARS CORN AND SOYBEANS IN THE MIDWEST GETS THEIR ATTENTION BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A NUMBERS GAME. AND SO THE HIGHER FOR PROGRAM -- TAKES ON PROJECTS ANNUALLY AND THEY TAKE ABOUT THREE TO FOUR YEARS TO COME TO FRUITION TO DO THE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THESE LABELS CAN ADD SOME OF THESE NEW SPECIALTY CROPS AND TRANSITION THEM TO SOME OF THESE OTHER MATERIALS THAT ARE CONSIDERED LESS TOXIC AND SAFER AND BETTER ALTERNATIVES. TO SOME OF THESE OLDER MATERIALS SO THAT'S THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PART OF THAT. OF THE TWO MILLION PART OF THAT IS FOR BIOLOGICALLY INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS ARE WHAT WE CALL BATHS. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY. SORT OF RESURRECTING IF YOU WILL THIS PROGRAM EXISTED OVER A DECADE AGO IN IT WAS A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOCUSED TO COME UP WITH BIOLOGICALLY INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS ARE TO USE. EXISTING BODY OF KNOWLEDGE IN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT ON DEMONSTRATION PLOT SO THE GROWERS COULD SEE FOR INSTANCE MAYBE THEIR NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE ROADS GROWING THE EXACT SAME TYPE OF CROP SO YOU KNOW THE LOCAL CONDITIONS EXIST THAT ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. YET THEY'RE DOCUMENTING A LOWER AMOUNT OF INPUTS AND ADOPTING PRACTICES LIKE ENHANCED SCOUTING AND WITHHOLDING TREATMENT UNTIL KNOWN ECONOMIC THRESHOLDS ARE MET SO THAT THEY CAN REDUCE PESTICIDE USAGE. THERE'S ALSO A COMPONENT THAT ALSO HELPS THEM TO MANAGE FERTILIZER USAGE WITHOUT SUFFERING YOUR LOSS OR QUALITY LOSS. AND SO IT'S REALLY JUST THAT TAKING THAT WHOLE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT BUT BIOLOGICALLY INTEGRATED APPROACH TO FARMING PUTTING IT OUT THERE. IN A VENUE LIKE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS WHERE GROWERS CAN SEE FIRSTHAND AND BUILD THAT TRUST LEVEL THAT THESE TECHNIQUES ARE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE AND WILL WORK. IN IN THE OUTCOME OBVIOUSLY AS THEY ADOPT THOSE TECHNIQUES AND WE HAVE LESS OF THOSE MATERIALS BEING USED. IN A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO FARMING WE KINDA SHIFT THE PARADIGM IF YOU WILL OVER TIME WHERE THEY'RE USING TECHNIQUES LIKE THAT. DO YOU FIND THEM OR DO THEY FIND YOU DO YOU ON THIS INTEGRATED. YOU KNOW. IN A GREAT FARMING SYSTEM TO GO OUT AND SAY HEY FARMER JONES WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY THIS -- ALTERNATIVE FARMING METHOD OR DO THEY COME TO YOU AND SAY. HEY I'VE GOT THIS ALTERNATE FARMING METHOD THAT LIKE THE TO THE USE IT AS A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT AND HAVE YOU. THE CORRECT THE UNIVERSITY HAS A BIG LARGE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY AVAILABLE TO GROWERS YOU OTHER WEBSITES PRETTY ROBUST THAT YOU CAN. SEARCH THE ROAD BY WHATEVER COMMODITY YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AND WHAT PART OF THE STATE YOU'RE IN. FOR A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE BUT WHAT'S REALLY MORE EFFECTIVE IS WHAT I MENTIONED DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS OUR VISION OF THIS. IS TO GIVE OUT GRANTS OR CONTRACTS IS THE THERE AGAIN THREE WILL UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION BECAUSE THEY WORK WITH GROWERS ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES. AND SO THIS COULD ADD TO THEIR PORTFOLIO OF IDENTIFYING GROWERS SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MORE DIRECTLY I GUESS. I SEE THIS AS MORE OF PUTTING THAT OUT TO GROWERS TO SAY HERE SOME TECHNIQUES THAT WE FEEL ARE VERY EFFECTIVE IN THIS AREA THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU AND HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE. LA -- PEST MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY ISSUES WITH THIS PROPOSAL [inaudible] CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THANK BOTH DEPARTMENTS IN PARTICULAR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR THE LEADERSHIP AND MOVING FORWARD IN [inaudible] WELL CHLORPYRIFOS IS FACING CANCELLATION. THE ADMINISTRATION'S MATCHING THAT WITH THIS COMMITMENT. TO EXPLORING ALTERNATIVES IN THIS I THINK AS YOU POINTED OUT. FOR PURPOSES NOT THE FIRST CHEMICAL THAT SPIN. DE REGISTERED AND THERE HAVE BEEN RESOURCES IN THE PAST ON INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT ON GOING WORK WITH COOP EXTENSION. UNIVERSITY USDA CDFA OM SO I THINK OVER TIME THERE'S BEEN. A POSITIVE MOOD TOWARDS GREATER RELIANCE ON INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT SUPPORTED BY AGRICULTURE -- IN FINDING THAT BALANCE BUT WE KNOW THE HISTORY WITH CORP HERE FOR US. THE USEPA HAD. CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS NOT SAFE ON A AND THEN THAT WAS A DECISION THAT WAS REVERSED. IN THIS IS PICKING UP ON THAT BODY OF EVIDENCE AS WELL SO NOT REALLY A QUESTION BUT JUST TO APPLAUD. THE DEPARTMENTS IN THE AGENCY IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO MOVE FORWARD IN A REASONABLE MANNER IN A MANNER THAT LOOKS TO THAN ONGOING NEEDS OF AGRICULTURE SO THANK YOU. SO I'M GONNA OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT. THE BAN ON CLERK FEAR FOSS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GRANT PROGRAM IN THE PESTICIDE ALTERNATIVE -- GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE UP HOPEFULLY. GO AHEAD HI AGAIN MISTER CHAIR JENNIFER FEARING HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY AND PESTICIDE ACTION NETWORK AND WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN TRANSITION. TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS AND PROPOSED PEST MANAGEMENT RESEARCH GRANTS. A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AND THE PROPOSED CROSS SECTOR WORK GROUP ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DEVELOP SHORT AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO THE USE OF PESTICIDES THAT ARE HARMFUL TO PEOPLE. WATER AIR AND WILDLIFE WE APPLIED THE PROPOSALS OUTLINED IN THE BUDGET TO DEVELOP AND FUND ECOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES RECOGNIZING THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO AVOID REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION. FOR CHLORPYRIFOS AND OTHER HARMFUL PESTICIDES. BOTH ORGANIZATIONS DO SUPPORT THE PROPOSED CANCELLATION OF PREPARE FOR US AND WE UNDERSTAND AND SEE THAT THESE PROPOSED BUDGET ACTIONS ARE PARALLEL AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE CANCELLATION BUT NOT CONTINGENT. ON THE CANCELLATION OF CORPORATE BOSSES JUSTIFIED BASED ON THE DEMONSTRATED HARMS TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND SHOULD PROCEED SWIFTLY SO WE DEAR -- SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET ITEM AND THINK THAT DEPARTMENTS FOR BRINGING IMPORTANT CERTAINLY ECHO THIS OF GRATITUDE TO THE GOVERNOR FOR TAKING ACTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS NIKITA CROWDED WITH A NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ENERGIES HE'S BEEN WORKING ON THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE SPRING HARMING PESTICIDE CLIPPER FOSS FOR DECADES. AND WE SUPPORT OF CANCELLATION BY DPR SOON AS POSSIBLE I'M ON A SEPARATE BUT PARALLEL TRACK WE SUPPORT THIS BUDGET REQUEST IN -- ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THIS TRANSITION TO SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVES WE DO WANNA MAKE SURE THOUGH THAT THE FUNDING -- IN THE ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS FUNDING IN THE IBM PROGRAMS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THE ME REVISED DON'T SUPPORT ADDITIONAL TOXIC CHEMICALS IN THIS IDEA OF REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTIONS -- WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING GO TOWARDS ORGANIC COMPLIANT HOLISTIC AND NON CHEMICAL PEST MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS A AND B. THING FRANKLY THAT THIS IS BENEFICIAL FOR FARMERS ACROSS THE BOARD AND SO. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION -- ON THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROGRAMS AND ALSO WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND OUR GRATITUDE TO THE GOVERNOR. SECRETARIES RAWSON BLUMENFELD I'M SENATOR DORADO IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOWER BROWN TODAY ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION CALIFORNIA FRESH FRUIT ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL AND THE CALIFORNIA COTTON. GROWERS JENNER SOCIAIS XIN AS WELL AS WESTERN AGRICULTURAL PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION AND HEARING TO THE CHAIRMAN'S -- INSTRUCTION I WILL NOT MENTION -- THE PRODUCT IN THE ACTION IT WAS TAKEN EARLIER THIS WEEK -- BUT DO WANT. TO SORRY APPRECIATION TO THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR COMING FORWARD WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF THE WORK GROUP THAT OUTLINED IN -- YOUR AGENDA IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND AND NECESSARY FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD AND AND SEE MORE OF THESE. PRODUCTS MORE THESE PRACTICES BE AVAILABLE HI THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM CDFA HIT IT EXACTLY CORRECT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FRYER. FOR THERE'S SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG THERE IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT DISINCENTIVE FOR MANUFACTURERS TO BRING NEWER SAFER PRODUCTS TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF LESS ACREAGE AND THE A ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT IT TAKES TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS TO THE STATE SO. THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL DEFINITELY PROVIDE GREATER ALTERNATIVES FOR FOR GROWERS MOVING FORWARD HOW WE ASK THAT YOU APPROVE -- THIS ITEM THANK YOU. OKAY WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING.
