I'M THIRTY ONE OF MY- MISTER PRESIDENT CAN WE CAN WE GO BACK TO. UNDER A MOTIONS AND- PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR BEFORE WE START WITH. I WOULD ASK FOR THE COURTESY YES. I JACKSON THANK YOU- SO COLLEAGUES I WANTED TO OPEN SESSION- A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN WE TYPICALLY DO- WITH THE. REMAIN OF MY OLLEAGUES I WANTED TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE SOME THINGS THESE ARE VERY MUCH UNPRECEDENTED TIMES AS THE GOVERNOR'S ACTIONS YESTERDAY IN THE ACTIONS WE SEEN FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. WE'VE HEARD FROM HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN A CRITICAL PERIOD FOR FLATTENING THE TRANSMISSION CURVE FOR COVERT NINETEEN. THE CORONA VIRUS IF WE'RE TO PREVENT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS FROM BEING OVERWHELMED. THE SENATE HAS ALREADY TAKEN STEPS TO MAKE THE CAPITAL CITY FOR AND TO HELP THOSE IN THE CAPITAL COMMUNITY FOLLOW PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES THEMSELVES. AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WHILE SOME OF US ON THIS FLOOR ARE SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER DOES INCLUDE EXEMPTIONS. WE APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE FOR THE ACTIONS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE TODAY. AND AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED SOCIAL DISTANCING IN THE SENATE CHAMBER. AS YOU KNOW THE CAPITAL WAS CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC OVER THE WEEKEND THIS WEEK'S COMMITTEE HEARINGS HAVE BEEN POSTPONED. AND SECRETARY CONTRAIRE US OFFICE HAS CONTACTED STAFF ABOUT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM. BEHIND THE SCENES WE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WITH OUR SERGEANTS WITH OUR SECURITY SCREENING TEAM ON NEW PROTOCOLS INCLUDING SOCIAL DISTANCING. NEW EQUIPMENT AND NEW SCREENING AND CLEANING PRACTICES. THE SENATE HAS ALSO BEEN TESTING REMOTE CAPABILITIES FOR MEETINGS AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY AND WE'RE WORKING TO HAVE THOSE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE FOR USE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IN A FEW MOMENTS WE'LL BE TAKING ADDITIONAL ACTIONS THAT WILL ACHIEVE THREE THINGS. TO PUT ADDITIONAL TOOLS AND RESOURCES WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED MOST TO HELP PROVIDE FOR BOTH LIFESAVING CARE AND PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS. TO HELP REDUCE THE RISK OF SENATORS STAFF AND OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR CAPITAL COMMUNITY EITHER CONTRACTING THE VIRUS ARE CARRYING IT TO OTHERS. AND THIRD TO PROVIDE AN IMMEDIATE WAY FOR US TO DO OUR PART TO HELP FLATTEN THE CURVE WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING OUR OVERALL WORK IS LEGISLATURE ON BILLS AND THE BUDGET. AS I SAID WE WILL NOT COMPROMISE THE DELIVERY OF FAIR AND OPEN GOVERNMENT IN OUR DEMOCRACY. BUT IN THIS TIME OF URGENCY IF THERE ARE BARRIERS TO NEEDED ACTION WE MUST TAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES. COLLEAGUES THE FACT THAT IT CAN'T BE BUSINESS AS USUAL AND IT CAN'T BE NO BUSINESS AT ALL WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIND THE RESPONSIBLE BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO AND I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES. WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS THE SENATE CONTINUES OUR RESPONSE TO THE EMERGENCY I HAVE TO SAY HOW PROUD I AM OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO SERVES EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS CHAMBER WHO SERVES THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE CAPITAL AND IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE I AM EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE. I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUE THE REPUBLICAN LEADER IS EQUALLY APPRECIATIVE I'VE HEARD OR EXPRESS IT NUMEROUS TIMES. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE SECURITY. OF HR AND PAYROLL AND HOUSEKEEPING STAFF WHOSE WORK IN THE BUILDING WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE IN THE CAPITAL FUNCTIONING DURING THIS CRISIS. I HOPE WE WOULD ALSO ALL HONOR AND THANK ALL THE WORKERS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS WHO CONTINUE TO WORK AROUND THE CLOCK INCLUDING OUR NURSES ARE DOCTORS ARE IN T. S. PERSONNEL OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO US IS ACTUALLY IMMEASURABLE. AND HELPING EASE THEIR BURDEN WHICH IS WHAT THE ACTIONS WE WILL TAKE TODAY WILL HELP DUE TO HELP EASE THEIR BURDEN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ANY OF US CAN DO RIGHT NOW. SO I WANNA SET THIS CONTEXT AS WE GO INTO THE ACTIONS THAT WE WILL TAKE AS THE SENATE AND AS A LEGISLATURE. I KNOW I'LL HAVE MORE TO SAY AS WE MOVE THROUGH SOME OF THE ACTIONS TODAY AND I KNOW THAT YOU MAY AS WELL. BUT I WANTED TO OPEN TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS WITH THIS OVERVIEW THIS PERSPECTIVE AND- THIS TONE IN CONTEXT AS WE GET STARTED AND SO MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR THE COURTESY OF ALLOWING ME TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS.

I THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THE EFFECTS OF WHAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL DO AND ALSO WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. THE TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT TO OUR ECONOMY WHICH I THINK IS GONNA BE SOMETHING WE WILL DEFINITELY BE FACING- IN THE FUTURE AND IS GOING TO BE A HUGE CHALLENGE AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS ON A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND WE SAW THE DOT COM. RISE AND FALL OF THAT AND ALSO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE SAW THE COMING DOWN OF THE HOUSING. CRISIS THIS WILL BE SIMILAR AYE I BELIEVE HOPEFULLY NOT.

SB EIGHTY NINE THANK CENTER DOLLARS CENTER Y. COFFEE I MISS PRESENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB- EIGHTY NINE I'M ONE OF THE- BAY AREA COUNTIES THAT ARE NOW SHELTERING INS IN PLACE IN THE THIS STATE OF EMERGENCY REQUIRES OUR LEADERSHIP TO SHOW CALM AND NOT TO PANIC AND HAVE THE PUBLIC RESPOND AS OUR COUNTIES ARE NOW ARE BUT BY ORDER OF THAT HEALTH OFFICER ARE ORDERING PEOPLE TO STAY AT HOME AS THEY CAN BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES THAT MUST REMAIN OPEN I WANT TO APPLAUD THE GENTLEMAN. FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHOSE AND FALL WITH THE AGRICULTURAL- IN THIS INDUSTRY THAT SO ESSENTIAL TO ALL OF US AT THIS TIME OF NEED AND I KNOW ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN- THAT ARE CALLED UPON BY THE HEALTH OFFICER OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS DEFINED IN PART IF I MAY READ HOW OBVIOUSLY HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS BUT ALSO GROCERY STORES CERTIFIED FARMERS MARKETS FARMING- PRODUCE STANDS SUPERMARKETS FOOD BANKS CONVENIENCE STORES AND OTHERS ENGAGED IN THE SALE OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES FRESH MEATS AND- FISH AND POULTRY THIS IS THE TIME FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. ARE FEEDING US THAT THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE THINGS AND THOSE ARE THE LIMITED ESSENTIAL- BUSINESSES THERE THERE AND WITH THAT I WOULD TONIGHT VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I TO RISE TO SUPPORT AS BE EIGHTY NINE I DO SO AT THE SAME TIME THAT I URGE OUR GOVERNOR TO DO WHAT THIS BODY HAS DONE OVER AND OVER AND THAT IS TO STAND WITH ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS AS THIS THE PURPOSE OF THIS FUNDING SAYS IT'S TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS AND- I JUST. ALL INDIVIDUALS IN THIS IN THE STATE THAT NOBODY GETS EXCLUDED FROM GETTING THE KIND OF HEALTH CARE AND THE SAFETY NET THEY DESERVE- AND NOT ONLY THAT IT'S THE SMARTEST THING TO DO BECAUSE WE WILL NOT GET THROUGH THIS CRISIS IF WE DO NOT GIVE THE TESTING THE TREATMENT AND THE CARE THAT EVERYONE NEEDS RIGHT NOW SENIORS WHO OVER SIXTY FIVE WHO ARE SAID TO BE THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUP. RIGHT NOW IF YOU ARE UNDOCUMENTED OVER SIXTY FIVE YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SO TO MY COLLEAGUES TO OUR UP UP PUT TâM WHO HAS BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF THIS ISSUE- I ASKED THE GOVERNOR TO PLEASE INCLUDE THIS IN HIS DELIBERATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF- SB EIGHT NINE NINE AND ALSO- SKEWS ME AS BE EIGHTY NINE I APOLOGIZE BUT ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE GOVERNOR TO THINK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT COVERED IN THIS I REALIZE THAT THE MONEY'S GOING TO BE APPROPRIATED TO HELP THE HOMELESS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE MAKE SURE WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT ENCAMPMENTS- AND HIGH DENSITY AS SHELTERS DO NOT AND HAVE THE SAME SITUATION OF AN OUTBREAK THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE SAME GOALS THAT HE HAS IN SOME OF THE SPENDING MANY IS EXACTLY WHAT MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES SUPPORT BUT THINGS THAT WERE NOT ADDRESSED- I REALIZE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE MANY THERE FOR EMPLOYEES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK AND THE HOMELESS POPULATION WHICH I JUST MENTIONED BUT IF WE DON'T GO BACK AND HELP THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS LOST A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF REVENUE. AND BEING ABLE TO KEEP THOSE EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED THEN WILL CONTINUALLY BE I'M GOING BACK TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF EMPLOYEES NOT GETTING A PAYCHECK AND EMPLOYEES POSSIBLY NOT HAVING A JOB TO GO BACK TO THE EMPLOYER ISN'T TAKING CARE OF AND THEN IMPACTS ARE MINIMIZED ON THEM A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR DISTRICTS ARE EXPERIENCING ESPECIALLY THE BUSINESS OWNER SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS RESTAURANTS- BARS AT. EVEN THE MCDONALDS CORPORATIONS THIS THE BUSINESS OWNERS ARE TEXTING ME I'VE GOTTEN TAX FROM OUR HOSPITAL EXECUTIVES THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A STAFFING RATIOS AND I KNOW THAT'S A BIG A POLITICAL ISSUE BUT WE NEED TO SET POLITICS ASIDE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE HAVE A NURSE ON STAFF IS CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF THREE TO FIVE TO TEN PATIENTS THAN THAT NEEDS TO BE LIFTED I MEAN THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT DESPERATELY NEED BE ADDRESS SO THAT WE LIMóN EIGHT THE RED TAPE. SO THAT WE CAN SERVICE OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE ALL STRUGGLING WITH THIS ISSUE AND THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE EMERGENCY CRISIS AT OUR STATE FINDS US I AND SO AGAIN I WOULD ASK THE GOVERNOR TO THINK ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT ASPECT OF IT BECAUSE WITHOUT THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE HAVE A JOB TO GO BACK TO AND- THAT COULD CREATE A HUGE PROBLEM AND ALSO IT CAN ALSO IMPACT A MORE HOMELESS. THE OTHER- ISSUE THAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS THE FARMING COMMUNITY AND I APPRECIATE MY I'M CALLING FROM THE BAY AREA. I'VE BEEN. A HAD PICTURES SENT TO ME ABOUT GROCERY STORES EMPTY SHELVES EVERYWHERE. AND WE HAVE- THE GOVERNOR OF THIS STATE IS BLESSED. TO BE ABLE TO GOVERNOR STATE. IT HAS THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE WORLD. MY COLLEAGUE- FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BOTH MY COLLEAGUES ALL THREE OF YOU GUYS I GUESS FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT JOIN ME- FRESNO KERN AND TULARE OR THE TOP FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES FOR THE ENTIRE. WORLD AND 99% OF SOME PRODUCTS ARE GROWN RIGHT HERE. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT FEED THE WORLD IN FEEDER CONSTITUENTS. SO I THINK WE NEED TO LEARN A LESSON IN ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT FOOD IS PRODUCED HERE DOMESTICALLY SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO NOT BE- DEPENDING ON OTHER FOREIGN NATIONS TO GET FOOD PRODUCTS AND WE DO DESPERATELY NEED THEM. AM I HOPE THE GOVERNOR TAKES SAID IN THIS CONSIDERATION. I DO APPLAUD HIM AND EVERYBODY THIS WORKED HARD THE SENATE PROTEIN HAS BEEN AMAZING. ON COMMUNICATION AND SO IS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WITH US. IN THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO- WORKING THROUGH THIS ISSUE IN THIS EMERGENCY RESPONSE THAT WE HAVE. TOGETHER AS A TEAM. AND NOT A SEPARATE PARTIES. THANK YOU SENATOR PAT.

AND WORK TOGETHER TO BE SURE WE MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THIS- INSPECTION- IT IS A COMMENT ON EACH OF US NOT JUST HERE IN THIS CHAMBER BUT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO LIMIT AND SLOW THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE AND CERTAINLY I THINK THIS PARTICULAR BILL EXPRESSES OUR TRUST AND FAITH IN OUR GOVERNOR GOVERNOR AND OUR LEADERSHIP TO USE. THE RESOURCES OR STATE WISELY IN A WAY THAT WILL AGAIN PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY HERE WE ARE TOGETHER JOIN TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN SAYING THAT WE ARE STANDING TOGETHER IS CALIFORNIANS TO PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SO CERTAINLY I WANTED- URGE I HOPEFULLY UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THIS CRISIS AND TO ENSURE THAT WE STOP.

BUT THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS- EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION- TO ALLOW- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO FIGHT OCTOBER NINETEEN- TO SAVE LIVES AND TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS THE CAPACITY TO KEEP PEOPLE HEALTHY- I ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS APPROPRIATION IN MY VIEW NEEDS TO BE A DOWN PAYMENT- AND DIED AS A DOWN PAYMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND I HOPE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TO REBUILDING OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM- TO MAKING SURE THAT NOT SAYS FOR NOW WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH THIS CRISIS BUT IN THE FUTURE THAT WE THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN- THAT WE HAVE A HEALTH SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO THE TAX AND THE CATS IN THE TAKE FIRM ACTION TO PROTECT OUR PUBLIC EARLY AND BEFORE IT GETS TO THIS POINT- AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH HOSPITAL BEDS AND VENTILATORS IN ALL OF THE OTHER NEEDS- TO KEEP PEOPLE HEALTHY. THIS IS A DOWN PAYMENT- WE NEED TO DO THIS AND I OR IS AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OF IT ON THE SIDE OF. NINETEEN NINE SENATOR MITCH WHICH ARE TOO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT  WOULD I AGREE WIH MY COLLEAGUE- FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY DOWN PAYMENT OF STATE DOLLARS BUT SHOULD BE PERCEIVED. AS A DOWN PAYMENT IN TERMS OF OUR EXPECTATION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES ACROSS THE BOARD THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ALSO BE EXPECTED TO STEP UP IN A MEANINGFUL AND SIGNIFICANT WAY. TO HELP THE NUMBER ONE DONOR STATE ON BAIL OUR WAY OUT OF THIS INTERNATIONAL CRISIS BASED ON COMMENTS MADE BY SOME OF THE PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR I JUST WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION- TO LEGISLATIVE INTENT LANGUAGE- NOTED ON- BUT THE THIRD PAGE OF THE BILL AND IT READS AS FOLLOWS.

TO BE CONSIDERED FOR INCLUSION IN THE BUDGET ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. AND SMALL BUSINESSES EXPERIENCING ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF COAL BUT NINETEEN IT IS OUR INTENTION AS WE CONTINUE OUR DELIBERATIONS.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB ONE SEVENTEEN- COMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS- ACTION ON HELPING SCHOOLS HAVE CERTAINTY AS THIS BUDGET YEAR AND SCHOOL YEAR PROGRESSES WITH A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY I ALSO WANT TO COMPLIMENT OUR APPROACH HIM AND BUDGET CHAIR- FOR GETTING THIS BILL TO THE FLOOR TODAY SO WE CAN TAKE THIS ACTION.BUT IN ADDITION I WANT TO COMPLIMENT ALL OF THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICT SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS AND SUPERINTENDENTS MANY OF WHOM TOOK ACTION BEFORE IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE GONNA BE REMAIN WHOLE- THEY WERE WRESTLING WITH THE SSUE OF PUTTING CHILDREN SAFETY FIRST AND NOT HAVING TO SAY WE'RE GONNA PUT KIDS IN HARM'S WAY BECAUSE OF BUDGETARY CONCERNS IN THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DID THE RIGHT THING ALSO RIVER DESERVE TO BE COMMENDED BECAUSE THIS IS A CASE WHERE. EVERYONE CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN WERE SAFE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HOLE AND WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS UNPRECEDENTED- PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS SO I STRONGLY URGE SUPPORT OF SB ONE SEVENTEEN THANK YOU SENATOR GIRL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I TO HAVE- RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS EDUCATION TRAILER BILL. AGAIN IT'S JUST THINGS THAT I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE THOUGHT AS I KNOW THAT MAKING SURE THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE MADE WHOLE THAT THERE'RE MANY IN THERE THE FOR THE RESOURCES CONTINUE- I GOT A TEXT FROM A TEACHER THAT HAS TWO YOUNG KIDS THAT IS GONNA BE REQUIRED TO GO TO SCHOOL. AND TAKERS YOUNG KIDS WITH HER TO SCHOOL TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS OF MAKING SURE THERE'S OTHER STUDENTS ARE KATE SAFE WHEN SHE DOESN'T HAVE DAY CARE FOR HER OWN CHILDREN AND SHE STILL REQUIRED TO GO. SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE DO HERE- WITHOUT FULL VETTING AND AGAIN WE HAVE TO ACT IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE LONGER DISCUSSIONS. ABOUT HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS ON THE GROUND AND OUR TEACHERS ARE TAKING CARE OF AND- TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN FAMILIES AS WELL. ANOTHER THING IS THAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE OPERATING REMOTELY AND ONE OF THE BARRIERS OF OPERATING REMOTELY AND NOT HAVING STUDENTS THERE WAS THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THE MISSING DAYS. BUT ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAVE OPERATING REMOTELY IS A LOT OF OUR MAJORITY MINORITY DISTRICTS IN A POOR COMMUNITIES EVEN IN MY DISTRICT DON'T HAVE CRIME NOTEBOOKS. SO STUDENTS CAN'T OPERATE THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A LAPTOP AT HOME SO HOW DID THEY PARTICIPATE WHERE DO THEY GO- SO ALL I WHERE I SEE HOW- WE ARE TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALMOST ALL STUDENTS. WE ARE FAILING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SOME STUDENTS AND I'D LIKE THAT DISCUSSION TO CONTINUE BUT IN THE MEANTIME I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD START- MAKING SURE THAT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS MADE WHOLE.

AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT ALL OF US EXPERIENCED ON IN OUR INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS WITH HIM IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIM SERVING ON COMMITTEE AND HEARING HIM STAND UP AND TAKE A POSITION ON THE FLOOR- BECAUSE HIS FAMILY WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM. HE ALWAYS TOUCH BASES WITH US IN OUR FAMILY AND- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL WITH MY FAMILY WITH CACCIA WHICH ALLOWED HIM TO. DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP WITHOUT MY SON THAT LASTED OVER THE YEARS AND- CAUGHT CHILL MADE IT A HABIT OF GIVING GIVING RYAN BOOKS. ON THE NEXT TIME HE'D SEE HIM HE WOULD ASK ME WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BOOK. AND SO I WILL FOREVER APPRECIATE CACHO FOR EMBRACING MY FAMILY AS WELL- THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER HERE WERE ALL CAPTURED IN IMAGES BY THE PRESS. AND ONE OF THE MY FAVORITE IMAGES THAT I WILL ALWAYS HONOR AND APPRECIATE WHICH WILL BRING A WARM SMILE TO MY FACE. IS THE IMAGE CAPTURE OF KHAT CHEWING ON THE BACK OF THE CHAMBERS IN THE ASSEMBLY BY. AP PHOTOGRAPHER RICH PETROCELLI. AND WHAT MAKES IT SO FUNNY IS **** AND I DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT WE WERE SAYING TO EACH OTHER. BECAUSE AFTER THE PICTURE RAN IN THE LA TIMES IT RUN IT REGULARLY WE WOULD CUT IT OUT EVERY COUPLE RUN AND SEND IT TO WORK TO EACH OTHER AND LAUGH. AND KOCH WAS KISSING ME ON MY CHEEK AND I'M HOLDING A CUP OF HOT TEA. AND I'M SAYING SOMETHING BACK TO **** WHO IS HERE. AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE SAYING TO EACH OTHER. BUT WHATEVER IT WAS YOU COULD TELL BY MY EXPRESSION THAT- HOW WARM I FELT ABOUT CACHO AND HOW MUCH FUN WE WERE HAVING IN THAT MOMENT. AND SO I APPRECIATE RICH FOR CAPTURING JUST THAT MOMENT IN TIME BETWEEN TWO COLLEAGUES THAT REALLY IS A REFLECTION TO THE WORLD. OF WHAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE WITH ONE ANOTHER WHEN WE CHOOSE FOR THEM TO BE I WANT TO JOIN WITH ALL OF YOU. IN HONORING- ARE TWENTY TEN CAT CLASSMATE. AT AN ELEGANT THINKING MAN FORMER ASSEMBLYMAN CACHO SHASHIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR UBER IS RUNNING GIVE THE PROTEIN THE LAST WORD PRO TWO MAC INSOFAR AS YOURS WELL THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND- I DON'T DESERVE THE LAST WORD BUT- I AM THRILLED THAT I GOT TO HEAR WHAT ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID ABOUT AN INCREASE INCREDIBLE INDIVIDUAL. ALSO A CLASS OF TWENTY TEN- WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE- HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST- KIND INDIVIDUALS I MEAN IT IS KIND OF AMAZING THAT YOU SEE EVERYBODY IN BOTH CHAMBERS OF GOAL IN EXTRA ORDINARY DISTANCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THIS RIGHT FOR SOMEONE WHO TRULY DESERVED IT- MY COMMENTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE AS AS I THINK PROFOUND AS- THAT OF MY COLLEAGUES BUT WE ALL HAVE STORIES. YOU KNOW OP I DON'T SMOKE CIGARS- BUT I HAVE A HUMIDOR- THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY CACHO- IT STORES GREAT THINGS JUST NOT CIGARS- BUT IT WAS JUST SUCH AN INCREDIBLE GIFT BECAUSE WE HAD- TRAVEL TO CUBA TOGETHER AND HE WAS IN HEAVEN. IN CUBA- YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE BUT- YOU KNOW TO SEE THE RESPECTIVE EVERYONE HAS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE LESSONS WE NEED TO LEARN IN HUMANITY ABOUT HOW SOMEONE COULD BE THAT KIND OF PERSON ARE A DECENT HUMAN BEING SOMEONE WHO ADORED HIS FAMILY AS YOU'VE SAID. I AND SOMEONE WHO RECOGNIZED YOUR FAMILY AND- MY SPOUSE LOVED IT I MEAN WE TRAVEL WHEN WE TRAVEL TO CUBA TOGETHER TO IT LOOK IT AG AND DO A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS WE CLEARLY HAD FUN HOWEVER IT WAS AN ENJOYABLE TRIP. AND WHEN YOU SAY- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES SAID HE WAS A MAN OF PRINCIPLE. WHEN YOU'RE A AN OF PRINCIPLE AND YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE IN A PLACE. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE PEOPLE CAN BE ANGRY AT YOU ARE OR- YOU KNOW THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS ABLE TO- JUST DEFY. LABELS FRANKLY. AND IT WAS JUST GENUINELY A GOOD HUMAN BEING AND I WILL SAY THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES. WHO REPRESENTED THE SENATE. I IT'S NOT OFTEN I THINK THAT SENATORS- AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CROSS OVER ALWAYS TO RECOGNIZE UNLESS THEY'VE SERVED WITH SOMEONE. BUT MANY OF YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE SERVED WITH CACHO ACTUALLY BUT YOU KNEW HIM AND YOU KNEW WHO HE WAS AND YOU KNEW THE RESPECT. THAT HE HELD- THE REPUBLICAN LEADER SAID HE WAS A STATESMAN I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. AND WE HAVE LOST AN INCREDIBLE STATESMAN AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR TAKING THE TIME TO GO REPRESENT US. OZ SO THAT HIS FAMILY KNEW THAT IT WAS WIDE WIDELY HELD. THAT HE WAS SOMEONE THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR STATE AND FOR THIS INSTITUTION. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME ADD A FEW WERE.

OUT WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WE NEED. OF THE- IN GROW I TO RAISE AN SUPPORT OF THIS RARE YOU KNOW IT'S THAT WE SHOW AND WHAT'S GOING ON ACROSS THE WORLD AND ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA AND LEADERSHIP IS IT HEARING TO THE RULES THAT HELP PREVENTS THE SPREADING OF COVERT NINETEEN IN MAKING SURE THAT WE- LEAD BY EXAMPLE SO I APPLIED THE SENATE PRO TEM FOR WORKING UP THE LANGUAGE WITH SPEAKER. AND I KNOW THAT TIME TO THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE NOT HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO WORK I A I KNOW THAT ALL OF US KNOW THAT IS ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY NOT TRUE WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE IN OUR DISTRICTS TO RESPOND TO THE LOCAL ISSUES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE WE WILL GO HOME AND FACE THE FACT THAT ALMOST EVERYONE OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVE CLOSED. PEOPLE ARE BEING REQUESTED NOT TO MEET- WITH OVER TEN PEOPLE IN PRESENCE WHICH WILL AFFECT OUR AFFECT OUR CHURCHES AND THEM A LOT OF BUSINESSES AND SO OUR WORK IT WILL BECOME HARDER THAN ALL OF US BEING RIGHT HERE IN THIS BUILDING TRYING TO ADDRESS LEGISLATIVE ISSUES THAT COME UP SO I THINK WITH THIS AND WE'RE WELL. IN OUR DISTRICTS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR DISTRICTS ARE TAKEN CARE OF THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD THINK IS GOING TO BE A FREE VACATION AND I KNOW NONE OF YOU THINK THAT I KNOW THAT E ARE I'M HEADED HOME TO HARDER WORK THAN WE'VE EVER FACED BEFORE IN THIS BUILDING AND SO I CHALLENGE YOU TO BE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF YOUR DISTRICT WHICH I KNOW YOU WILL. AND LET US CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEMS I'M IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE AND NOT JUST YOU KNOW IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE ALL FACING THIS TOGETHER. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION A- SCENE HERE NUNS. MADAM PRO TO. WHICH CLOSE. I YES I WILL DO THE VERY. FIVE AND WILL HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS AS WE CLOSE. FOR THE EVENING- I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR- THESE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT STEPS THAT WE'VE TAKEN TODAY AND AYE I EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU I WANT TO THANK BUT I WANT TO EXPAND MY INCREDIBLE THANKS TO THE REPUBLICAN LEADER. WE I THINK HAVE PUT PARTISAN POLITICS ASIDE TO COME TOGETHER TO TAKE THESE ACTIONS TODAY. AND FIVE WE AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT EVERY POSSIBLE ACTION TO TAKE IN ORDER FOR THE STATE SENATE TO DO OUR PART IN THIS CRISIS. I DESCRIBE SEVERAL SEVERAL OF THOSE ACTIONS EARLIER TODAY OUR CONSIDERATIONS HAVE BEEN SCIENCE DRIVEN AND BASED IN BOTH PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND MAINTAINING ACCESS TO THIS PUBLIC INSTITUTION. RESPONDING TO THE CORRUPT CORONAVIRUS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO FACE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN MODERN TIMES. THE RESPONSIBLE THING FR US TO DO IS TO HELP FLATTEN THE CURB REDUCE TRANSMISSION KEEP OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ABOVE WATER. THAT IS THE INTENT OF THE ACTIONS THAT WE ARE TAKING THAT DOES NOT MEAN. AS THE REPUBLICAN LEADER SAID THE SENATE WILL BE CLOSED IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD IN FACT I THINK VERY LIKELY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE WORK THAN EVER TO DO. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING OUR CONSTITUENTS WAS SUPPORT INFORMATIONAND GUIDANCE. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH ON COVERT NINETEEN THERE ARE STILL A CRISIS AND HOUSING HOMELESSNESS POTENTIAL DEVASTATION FROM WILDFIRES ANC LEVEL RISE. STILL PROGRESS IT NEEDS TO BE MADE ON A HOST OF CHALLENGES FACING OUR STATE. WE WILL BE PREPARED ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE TO RETURN TO ADDRESS ANY URGENT ACTION THAT WE MUST AND NEED TO TAKE. I MENTIONED EARLIER SOME OF THE STAFF WHOSE WORK IN THE BUILDING ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURING THE MECHANICS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE CAPITAL KEEP GOING. I KNOW MANY OF MY STAFF WILL CONTINUE WORKING IN THE BUILDING AS WELL WHILE OTHERS-ARE MY STAFF WILL WORK REMOTELY YOURS AS WELL. BUT I HAVING A MIX OF FOLKS WORKING IN THE BUILDING AND WORKING REMOTELY WE ABSOLUTELY DO LESSEN THE RISK. AND AGAIN WE DO OUR PART TO HELP FLATTEN OCCUR. SO COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE PATIENTS AND SACRIFICE FROM ALL OF US IN THIS STATE TO MITIGATE THIS PANDEMIC. AND MINIMIZE ITS HARM TO OUR HEALTH CARESYSTEMS AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WE WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED WITH THE VERY BEST INFORMATION WE CAN IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD. SO THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT FOR THE ADDITIONAL TIME. PLEASE I URGE AN AYE VOTE. MEMBERS IS THERE ANY OBJECTION TO USING A UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL ON THE SIDE OF. SEE NINE OZ THIRTY TWO NO ZERO. THE RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED. WHAT IS THAT I'M SORRY SENATOR YEAH AND I IT'S IT REGARDING THAT ALSO BE UNDER A WE CAN GO TO MOTIONS RESOLUTIONS IF THAT WOULD BE A APPROPRIATE. WORD NOW IT MORE WERE. SOONER BREAUX THANK YOU MISTER. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RECESS I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SPECIFIC BILL OF. REGARDING RECESS BUT I KNEW THAT THE SENATE PRO TEM AND I WERE GOING TO MAKE CLOSING REMARKS AND- SO I APOLOGIZE SENATE PRETEND FOR NOT MAKING MY CLOSING REMARKS AT THE PREPARATORY. BUT I DID WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT. ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCRIPTURES AS ROMANS EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT. AM IT'S HAS GOTTEN WORK ALL THINGS OUT TOGETHER FOR GOOD FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN THE CALLED ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE. AND I THINKABOUT OUR SESSION I'VE BEEN HERE SIX YEARS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND NOW YEAR AND A HALF IN THE SENATE. AND I'VE NEVER FACED A LEGISLATIVE SESSION LIKE WE FACE HERE TODAY. AND NOT TO MENTION WHAT WE FACE THE LAST NIGHT OF SESSION. LAST YEAR WHEN WE WERE HERE SO THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WHERE WE- EVEN THOUGH OPPOSITE SIDE THE AISLE WE'VE COME TOGETHER. AND OVERCAME A LOT OF THINGS. THE LAST NIGHT A SESSION FOR INSTANCE. WE OVERCAME LEAVING THIS PART OF THE CHAMBER AND GOING INTO A- REMOTE LOCATION AND THE STAFF PULLED TOGETHER AND MADE SURE THAT EVERY VOTE COUNTED IN THAT WE HAD. THE PROTECTIONS. A CONSTITUTIONALLY AND- TO PROVE TO THE PUBLIC THAT WE ACTUALLY CAST THOSE VOTES HAD MADE THOSE DECISIONS. SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME WITH CODE NINETEEN AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT THE SENATE PRO TEM AND I HAVE. GONE THROUGH. I AM NOT JUST S. BUT I JUST REALLY DO. I WANT TO SAY THAT I WOULD NOT RATHER AND NO OFFENSE TO ANYBODY IN THE ROOM BUT I WOULD RATHER. AND SHOULDER TO SHOW. WITH SENATE PRO TEM TONI ATKINS. ON THIS ISSUE FACING OUR STATE. BECAUSE SHE PROVIDES FAIR LEADERSHIP. SHE INCLUDES S. AND I THINK THAT WHEN I WHEN I QUOTED THAT SCRIPTURE EARLIER I THINK ABOUT. THE PRESIDENT THE UNITED STATES WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF% CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNOR OF THE CALIFORNIA SPEAKING POSITIVELY ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP GOING ON WITH THE PRESENT UNITED STATES IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO SOLVE pTEM THE DEMOCRAT LEADER OF THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE MINORITY LEADER THE REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE HOUSE WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR CAUCUSES TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT JUST SHOWS THAT. YOU KNOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON ISSUES THAT FACE CALIFORNIANS AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTECTED AND SAFE AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE PROTECTION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. NO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO CUT OUT FOR US. AND I THINK THAT. WE OWE A GREAT DEAL OF GRATITUDE TO ERICA CONTRARIES WHO'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE. HE HAS PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSTITUTIONALLY WE ARE- ABLE TO CAST A VOTE IF WE CANNOT COME BACK IN CAST A VOTEHERE. SHE IS PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR STAFF HERE YOU KNOW THREE THOUSAND OR SO EMPLOYEES IN THIS BUILDING. THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. MATT THERE'S ME WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS EMPLOYERS NOT JUST LEGISLATORS TO GOVERN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BE A PART OF THAT PROCESS. BERNIE AND EVERYBODY THAT'S PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROJECT THE SERGEANTS THE CHIEF YOU KNOW EVERYBODY THAT'S PARTICIPATED IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'VE BEEN SAFE IN THIS BUILDING. THE G. S. I MEAN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON BUT NUMBER ONE I THINK IT JUST SHOWS. GREAT STATESMANSHIP FOR EVERYONE OF YOU TO WORK WITH THE S. YOU COULD'VE RAMROD ANYTHING YOU WANTED THROUGH THIS BUILDING WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION OF OUR THOUGHT PROCESS WHATSOEVER. AND I JUST SUPPLY THE SENATE PRO TEM IN THE GOVERNOR FOR MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE INCLUDED IN THE PROCESS- THERE WERE SOME MISHAPS AND WE VOICE OUR OPINION ABOUT THOSE MISHAPS. THE IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE A PART OF THE PROCESS. BECAUSE THIS ISN'T A PARTISAN ISSUE THIS IS SOMETHING ABOUT PROTECTING THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU ON BEHALF OF MY SENATE COLLEAGUES- ON THE SIDE OF THE AISLE AND TELL YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE A PART OF THIS PROCESS. TO HELP THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE. MEMBERS WERE RETURNING TO MOTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS.
