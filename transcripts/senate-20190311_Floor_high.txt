THE PAD PROJECT IS WORKING TO STOP THIS THEIR MOTTO. A PERIOD SHOULD END A SENTENCE NOT A GIRLS EDUCATION. AS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN A NUMBER OF THESE COUNTRIES. THESE INCREDIBLE YOUNG WOMEN HERE TODAY HAVE FUNDRAISED TO PURCHASE PAD MACHINES FOR RURAL INDIAN VILLAGERS. WERE ADMINISTRATION SO TABOO THAT A WOMAN IS ARE BANNED FROM ENTERING TEMPLES AND SOMETIMES THEIR OWN HOMES. BECAUSE OF IT. THINK ABOUT THAT. THESE STUDENTS OF COMMUNITY THAT THEY SPEND THEIR TIME AND ENERGY HELPING YOUNG WOMEN JUST LIKE THEMSELVES MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND MILES AWAY. BECAUSE SAY THEY SEE AND HAVE SEEN THIS ISSUE IN A HUMAN TERMS THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US NO MATTER WHAT PART OF THE WORLD YOU LIVE IN.

SKINNER -- COLLEAGUES IS WITH GREAT SADNESS -- THAT I RISE TO HOUSE AT THE SENATE FIVE TESTS ROTHSTEIN ON A VIBRANT YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS TAKEN FROM US. WHILE BIKING TO WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO ON FRIDAY MORNING. I TASK TO IS A WAS A RESIDENT OF BERKELEY. WORKED AS A RESEARCHER FOR MEDIUM AND AIRBNB FOCUSING ON USER EXPERIENCE AND DESIGN. SHE WAS KILLED ON FRIDAY MORNING WHILE BIKING IN THE SOUTH OF MARKET NEIGHBORHOOD. WHEN SHE WAS STRUCK BY A COMMERCIAL TRUCK NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF SIX AND HOWARD? HER DEATH IS YET ANOTHER TRAGIC EXAMPLE AND WE THOUGHT FAR TOO MANY OF THESE EXAMPLES. OF HOW ARE CITIES FELL TO PROTECT CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS. IN FAVOR OF CARS. WE DESPERATELY NEED MORE PROTECTED BIKE LANES IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ELSEWHERE. SO THAT WE HAVE SAFE STREETS. THEY PROTECTED BIKE LANE WOULD HAVE SAVED PASSES LIFE. NO MORE EXCUSES. TESS IS MOURNED BY HER FRIENDS HER CO WORKERS AND A VERY VERY LARGE COMMUNITY. WITH PEOPLE SAYING THINGS LIKE HOUSE WAS A QUOTE MODEL OF CONFIDENT CURIOUS. AND COMPASSIONATE HUMANITY FOR ALL OF US. COLLEAGUES I ASKED THAT WE ADJOURN INTESTINES MEMORY TODAY. AND I FURTHER ASK ABOUT HER TRAGIC DEATH SERVICE A STRONG IMPETUS TO MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR WIENER CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES SORRY RISE TO ALSO ADDS TO THE JOURNEY MEMORY FOR MY CONSTITUENTS TEST ROTHSTEIN. AND OUR COLLEAGUE FROM CIRRHOSIS CODE DID DESCRIBE. WHO SHE WAS WELL TO YOU -- BUT I WANT TO ADD. THAT WE WE DO NEED TO DO MUCH MORE ABOUT. CYCLIST AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY SAFETY. I DON'T HAVE DATA ON INCREASING DEATHS PER SE. BUT IT IS WAY TOO COMMON WAY TOO FREQUENT. AND JUSTIN BERKELEY ALONE MY COMMUNITY CAN CYCLISTS WERE HIT BY CARS. IN FEBRUARY. ELEVEN RORY NOT ALL WERE FATALITIES. BUT THAT'S HOW MANY AND IF I GIVE YOU PEDESTRIAN. THE NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS THAT WERE HIT. JUSTIN BERKELEY ALONE. IT WOULD BE HARD TO A TO BELIEF. SO. I THINK IT REALLY IS INCUMBENT UPON US BECAUSE ALL OF US WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO ACT OF TRANSPORTATION WITHOUT RISKING OUR LIVES. IN WITH CAR SAFETY IMPROVED SO GREATLY WE DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE THE ONLY TIME WE ARE EVER GOING TO BE SAFE IS IN A CAR -- SO IT IS COMPLETELY TRAGIC THE TEST ROTHSTEIN LOST HER LIFE IN THIS WAY MY HEART GOES OUT TO HER FAMILY AND HER FRIENDS AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. FOR ASKING US TO TURN IN HER MEMORY. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER SIR WIENER PLEASE MAKE SURE HER NAME IS BROUGHT FORWARD THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY TO JOIN IN MEMORY OF FORMER SAN DIEGO CITY COUNCIL MEMBER JUDY MCCARTY. SHE PASSED AWAY ON MONDAY MARCH FOURTH AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY EIGHT AFTER AN EXTENDED ILLNESS. COUNCILMEMBER MCCARTY WAS ONE OF THE LONGEST SERVING CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS IN SAN DIEGO HISTORY. REPRESENTING DISTRICT SEVEN WHICH I NOW REPRESENT IN THE IN THE SENATE. FOR FOUR CONSECUTIVE TERMS FROM. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE TO TWO THOUSAND AND ON A PERSONAL NOTE HI I WAS A STAFF MEMBER.

I WAS GOOD AT IT THREE PEOPLE SPLIT THAT COMMUNITY I KNOW WE TRY TO KEEP COMMUNITIES TOGETHER AND THAT'S KIND OF A FACET OF REDISTRICTING. BUT THAT COMMUNITY HAD -- MORE THAN NINETY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE EIGHTY FIVE LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS SPOKEN. AND THE LOWEST AVERAGE MEDIAN INCOME -- IN THE CITY. AND TO HAVE THREE COUNCIL MEMBERS FROM THREE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND POLITICAL PERSUASIONS FRANKLY REPRESENT THAT COMMUNITY MEANT THAT THERE WAS A REAL FOCUS ON THAT COMMUNITY. AND JUDY -- WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST FIRST THAT I WAS ABLE TO LEARN FROM. A COLLEAGUE. AND A FRIEND UNTIL THE END SHE'S FINALLY REMEMBERED FOR HER WORK TO INVEST IN SAN DIEGO'S PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE ESPECIALLY PARKS AND LIBRARIES. WHICH ARE VITAL TO BUILDING COMMUNITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE COLLEAGUES ON THE CITY COUNCIL REMEMBER HER AS HARD WORKING NO NONSENSE TYPE OF LEADER. TRUE TO HER MIDWESTERN ROOTS SHE SPOKE SOFTLY BUT SHE WAS SOLID AND SERIOUS IN HER WORK AND HER CAUSES. AMONG HER MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS SHE WAS PERHAPS MOST PROUD OF HER WORK ON BEHALF OF MISSION TRAILS REGIONAL PARK I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO VISIT THAT PARK I IT CONTINUES TO BE A POINT OF PRIDE FOR OUR COMMUNITY AS THE LARGEST CITY PARK IN AMERICA.
