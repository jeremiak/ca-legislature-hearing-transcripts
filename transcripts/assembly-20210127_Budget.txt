THE STATE'S CURRENT EVICTION MORATORIUM AS WE ALL KNOW EXPIRES ON THE SUNDAY JANUARY THIRTY FIRST. WE KNOW THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DEVASTATE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO CANNOT PAY RENT THEY WILL BE FORCED- POTENTIALLY OUT OF THEIR HOMES. WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE TOOK ACTION TO MOVE THE TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL AID THAT WE RECEIVE BUT ALSO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND OUR MORATORIUM. LET ME JUST IN PARTICULAR I THINK THE YOU KNOW LEADERSHIP FROM OUR SPEAKER I KNOW ASSEMBLYMEMBERS CHIU AND RARE STOP MAJORITY LEADER RAY S. AS WELL AS A MEMBER STONE. WE'RE VERY CRITICAL IN THIS- HOUSES DELIBERATION OVER THE OBJECTION MORATORIUM EXPANSION BUT WE THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IN ORDER TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT THEIR MANY MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WHO. HAVE BEEN TRYING TO STAY AFLOAT AS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING ANY RENT. SO JUST IN TERMS OF A YOU KNOW JUST IN TERMS OF HOUSEKEEPING WE'VE GOT TO PERMIT FINEST PRESENT BOTH BILLS TOGETHER FOLLOWED BY COMMENTS FROM LA- OTHER MEMBERS OF- FINANCE AS WELL AS AGENCY OR I WILL STOP ARE AVAILABLE AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO MEMBERS QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS I WAS JUST GOING TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY OPENING COMMENTS FROM DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE LOOKING FOR NEW VICE CHAIR MISTER FOX.

HELP A GROUP OF BUT HELP EVERY GROUP OF CALIFORNIANS GET OUT THIS PANDEMIC- GET BACK TO WORK THE OPENER ECONOMY I GET KIDS BACK INTO SCHOOL INTO THE AND I FULLY APPRECIATE THE URGENCY OF THIS SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN. AND WE MUST TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO OUR CONSTITUENTS I WILL ADMIT. THAT THE PROCESS WE'RE DEALING WITH IS FRUSTRATING AND NOT JUST MYSELF AND TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES- BUT TO THE PUBLIC OUTSIDE HIS BUILDING LOOKING TO US. TO GOVERN SO THE PROCESS ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE BETTER AS OF THE MEASURES LIKE THESE- BEFORE US CANNOT BE PROPERLY CONSIDERED. YEAH I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE AND WHAT IT'S DONE AND AN ASSORTMENT OF TIME THAT WE HAVE HAD SINCE YOU'VE BEEN SESSION. I LOOK FORWARD TO A THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION TODAY. THE TICKET WAS FROM ANY OTHER MEMBER. ONE OF MAKE OPENING COME. ABSOLUTELY SO THEN LET'S LET'S START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FIRST AND THEY WERE GONNA GO TO EL AL AND I BELIEVE IT'S- MISS ERIKA LEE WHO'S HERE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS MISLI ONCE YOU START TALKING YOU SHOULD APPEAR ON THE SCREEN JUST MAKE SURE YOU AND YOURSELF. I CAN MORNING THERE YOU GO WE HEAR YOU WE'RE GOING TO SO I HOPE WE'LL SEE YOU THERE YOU GO PERFECT LOOKING. OKAY. I'M GOOD MORNING TERRY TANG VICE CHAIR FONG MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ERICA LANE APARTMENT NO FINANCED. TODAY I WILL BE PRESENTING- SB EIGHTY NINE A BUDGET BILL. WHICH AMENDS THE CURRENT BUDGET SB NINETY ONE A TRAILER BILL WHICH EXTENDS THE STATE'S EVICTION MORATORIUM. AND CREATES A STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ALLOCATE FEDERAL RENTAL AND LANDLORDS EARLY. I'M SB NINE BUDGET BILL IS FAIRLY SHORT IT CONSISTS OF TECHNICAL ITEMS- SB EIGHTY NINE ADDS TO TECHNICAL ITEMS TO THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. OR HDD AS I RECALL IT THE NECESSARY AUTHORITIES AND FLEXIBILITIES TO IMPLEMENT AND ADMINISTER THE FEDERAL FUNDS ALLOCATED TO CALIFORNIA UNDER THE RECENT FEDERAL QUICKLY FELL. THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION THESE TECHNICAL BUDGET ITEMS AUTHORIZES HCD TO TRANSFER AND USE UP 210% OF THE FUNDS PROVIDED. TO MINISTER THE PROGRAM. I'M THAT'S SB EIGHTY NINE OUT OF MOVING TESTING I DO WANT WHICH IS THE TRAILER BILL AND THAT INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT EXTEND THE STATE'S DEPICTION MORATORIUM AS CHAIR TEAM MENTIONED AND ESTABLISHES A STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. I'M GOING BACK TO LATE- LAST AUGUST THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH INCLUDED THE NATION'S STRONGEST EVICTION PROTECT PROTECTIONS. AB THIRTY EIGHTEEN HAS PREVENTED MANY CALIFORNIANS FROM EXPERIENCING INFECTIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC WHICH HAS RESULTED IN LOSSES AND INCOME NEGATIVELY IMPACTING BUT CALIFORNIA RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS. HOWEVER THE PRIMARY PROVISIONS OF THIS LAW AGAIN AS WAS MENTIONED WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS MONTH. BUT NOT BEFORE MOVING INTO THE DETAILS OF MESQUITE NINETY ONE I WANTED YOU TO JUST NOTE THAT AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT ALSO CHARGE THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. WITH ARE ENGAGING RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT STRATEGIES TO DIRECT POTENTIAL FUTURE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE. AND MANY OF THE PRINCIPLE DESIGNS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM- WERE WERE INFORMED BY THE STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH GROUP- AND DISTRIBUTED LEGISLATIVE STAFF. TENANT AND LANDLORD GROUPS HOUSING DEVELOPERS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AMONG MANY OTHER INSTITUTE AMONG AMONG OTHER GROUPS TOTALING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS SO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT. A LOT OF WHAT YOU'LL BE HEARING SB NINETY ONE WAS. INFORMED BY THIS GROUP. SO NOW SB NINETY- SB A ONE PROVISION THAT EXIST. THE STATE CURRENT EVICTION MORATORIUM FOR TEN THAT ARE. TO PAY RENT DO BECAUSE AT A LATER FINANCIAL. BY FIVE MONTHS SO FROM JANUARY THIRTY AND JUNE. OF THIS YEAR. TENANTS MUST CONTINUE TO PAY 5% THEIR US OBLIGATE AS A REQUIRED UNDER AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT- DURING THIS TIME IF TENANTS CONTINUE TO PAY AT LEAST THIS AMOUNT JUNE THIRTIETH. THEY'RE PROTECTED FROM ADDICTION FOR ANI ANY UNPAID RENT THAT. HAS ACCUMULATED DURING THIS GIVEN. SB NINE ONE ALL EXPAND THE SAME THIRTY EIGHT EIGHT AB EIGHTY EIGHT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS. THAT ARE RELATED TO MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE REQUEST. AND IT EXTENDS THE PROHIBITION ON COMMENCING ON ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. TO RECOVER SO THE NINETEEN RENTAL DEBT- TO AUGUST FIRST AND HERE. SO GOING INTO THE STATE MENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SB NINETY ONE ESTABLISHES THIS PROGRAM AND IT WILL ALLOCATE FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN TOTAL THE STATE RECEIVED OR WILL RECEIVE TWO POINT SIX BILLION AND ONE POINT FIVE BILLION OF THAT IS COMING DIRECTLY TO THE STATE ONE POINT ONE BILLION IS ALLOCATED DIRECTLY BY THE US TREASURY TO JURISDICTIONS WITH POPULATIONS GREATER THAN TWO HUNDRED. THAT INCLUDES COUNTY. THE PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE ELIGIBLE LANDLORDS WITH THE MEDIA AT LEAST- THROUGH THE PAYMENT OF 80% OF THEIR RENTAL ARREARS. THAT WERE ACCUMULATED IT STARTING IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR THROUGH MARCH OF THIS YEAR. AND IN RETURN LANDLORDS RECEIVE IMMEDIATE RELIEF AGREED TO ACCEPT IT AS PAYMENT IN FULL FORGIVING THE REMAINING RENTAL DESK FOR THE GIVEN TIME. NOW IT'S THE TABLE ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM- WILL ADMINISTER THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM- FUNDS. SORRY ACT WILL ADMINISTER THE FUNDS THAT ARE RECEIVED BY THE STATE THROUGH EIGHT YOU'RE EITHER A BLOCK GRANT ALLOCATIONS. I'M TO JURISDICTIONS OR THROUGH A THIRD PARTY INFLUENCERS. LARGER JURISDICTIONS MAY RECEIVE A DIRECT BLOCK GRANT FROM THE STATE TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR DIRECT ALLOCATION FROM THE US TREASURY- WELL FUNDING FOR SMALLER JURISDICTIONS WILL BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE STATE PROGRAM RANKED. THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTS. AND JUST UP I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THIRD PARTY ADMNISTRATOR. IN AWARDING THE PROGRAM TO THIS IN IMPLEMENTOR SB NINETY ONE ESTABLISHES A NUMBER EXPECTATIONS- INSTANTIATE INCLUDING THAT THE VENDOR HAVE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY LEVEL PARTNERS. AND THIS WILL HELP INSURE ALL AREAS IN TARGET COMMUNITIES INCLUDING NON ENGLISH SPEAKING HARD TO REACH HOUSEHOLDS- RACIAL EQUITY IN TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. HAVE ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT STATEWIDE- PEOPLE- IN VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES IN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS COULD START. I'M ALSO THE VENDOR IT MUST HAVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL CAPACITY TO STAND UP A SEXUAL ONLINE APPLICATION PORTAL AND SYSTEM THAT SERVES BOTH LANDLORDS AND TENANTS. AND HAS MOBILE AND MULTI LINGUAL. KEEP I'M AND I ALSO HAVE A CAPACITY TO BE AVAIL TWENTY HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. AND HAD A LEVELING- WITHOUT DISRUPTION. NEW THAT'S ATTENTION TOP ENSURE THE OUT REGION. AND PUBLIC AWARE OF THE AND THEY'RE BETTER. AND RIGHTS ON THIS. BOTH FOR LANDLORDS AND FOR TEN. IT ALSO ENSURES CONSISTENCY RELIABILITY AND ACCESS. I'M IN TO ALLOCATE. STATE FUNDING WILL BE ALLOCATED FOR JURISDICTIONS BASED ON OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE POPULATION THERE IS A SMALL COUNTY CARVE OUT OF THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND BE SMART SMALLER COUNTIES- WILL HAVE POPULATIONS UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND DID NOT RECEIVE DIRECT INDIRECT ALLOCATION AS TREASURY. LARGE JURISDICTIONS WITH POPULATIONS ABOVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WILL RECEIVE FUNDS BASED ON THEIR PERCENTAGE ALL. THAT BOTH LANDLORDS AND TENANTS MAY APPLY TO THE PROGRAM PERSISTENCE THE FEDERAL PROGRAM DOES EMPHASIZE LANDMARK EDUCATION I'M IN CASES WHERE LANDLORDS CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE THE PROGRAM STILL- THEY STILL CANNOT EVICT TENANTS FOR NON PAYMENT OF RENT SO LONG AS THAT TENET CONTINUES TO PAY THE 25% OF RIGHT. THROUGH THE TIME CARRIED UP JUNE THIRTIETH- BUT IN THESE CASES AN ELIGIBLE TENANT MAY APPLY TO THE PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THEIR LANDLORD. AND RECEIVED 25% OF THEIR REPAIRS THAT MUST THEN GO TO A LOT MORE TO PAY. FOR THEIR FRIENDS. SO RECOGNIZING THE NEED OF COMMUNITY AND STRICT FEDERAL REQUIRE. AROUND THESE PLANS H. C. H. D. Y. A BLOCK GRANT. IMMEDIATE AFTER CHURCH JURISDICTIONS OPT INTO THE PROGRAM. AND CONTRACTS ARE EXECUTED. AND THEN AFTER THAT GRANTEES MUST OBLIGATE AT LEAST JUNE FIRST. AND ALL OF THEIR STATE FUNDS MUST BE EXPENDED BY AUGUST FIRST. AT THAT TIME UNUSED FUNDS WILL BE REALLOCATED EXPANDED THROUGH THE STATE RUN PROGRAM. NOW THE TIMING IS THIS THAT TIMING IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S BASED ON THE FEDERAL TIMING WHICH BASICALLY SAYS. THAT ALL FUNDS MUST BE EXPENDED BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR. AND ADDITIONALLY ANY GRANT T. THAT HAS NOT OBLIGATED AT LEAST 65% OF THESE FINE. BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER ARE AT RISK OF HAVING THESE FUNDS CHECKING BACK- TO. GETTING BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- WHICH WOULD THEN REALLOCATE. THE DOLLARS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOUR PARTNER INTEGRITY I KIND OF. PROGRAM FUND PROVIDE TO GRANT WILL BE TO THE SAME RECORDING AFTER. REQUIREMENTS AS THOSE. RIGHT IN THE FEDERAL. AT AGE TO THE WALL- IT INCLUDED IT IN THE TRAILER ABOUT THE L. H. U. D. WELL REPORT MONTHLY TO JAIL THE SEAT FOR THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAM SAID THE LEGISLATURE IS AWARE OF PERFORMANCE METRICS. AND AGAIN THIS IS OPPORTUNE CURRENCY AND FOR COMPATIBILITY- STATEWIDE PROGRAM AND THE BLOCKS GRANTED FUNDS. SO IN CLOSING THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM IS REALLY TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE FUNDS COMING TO CALIFORNIA I'M DOING THIS EFFICIENTLY EQUITABLY AND WESTCON ABILITY AND ALSO OBVIOUSLY TO STAVE OFF INFECTIONS AS YOU OFFER ASSISTANCE TO TENANTS AND LANDLORDS- WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS I'M JOINED BY SENIOR STAFF FROM THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES. HOUSING AGENCY AS WELL AS COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- LOOKS AT AGENCY WERE REALLY INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING TO DEVELOP THIS PROGRAM IT'S WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER IN MORE DETAIL SOME OF THE PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS FOR MONTHS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHRIMP YOU MISLI NOW WE'RE GONNA GO. TO HELL ELSE. GOOD MORNING FROM OHIO. IN YOUR QUEST THAT. THEY CAN MAY HAVE US OKAY THANK YOU MISTER WELL WE CAN HEAR AND SEE YOU JUST FIND GOING TO. MR CHIU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LET ME START BY. THE THANK TO LEADERS. FROM THE SAN FROM THE BECOME OFFICE. FOR DEVELOPING THIS DEAL THAT EXTENDS THE EVICTION MORATORIUM AND GETS TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OUT QUICKLY TO STRUGGLING TENANTS AND LANDLORDS. INNOCENTLY I JUST WANNA TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK OUR MAJORITY LEADER RADIUS ARE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIR STONE. FROM THE SPEAKER STAFF MY SHOULD JACKSON AND KATIE COOLEY CHOSE. FOR MORE HOUSING COMMITTEE STAFF LISA ANGLE AND SANDRA NOT GALA THESE ARE STAFFERS THAT WORKED ROUND THE CLOCK. TO GET THIS DONE AS WELL AS ADVOCATES ON ALL SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. I HAVE SAID FOR MONTHS THAT WE HAVE TO EXTEND THE CONVICTION MORATORIUM BEFORE JANUARY THIRTY FIRST OR ELSE CALIFORNIA TENANTS. ARE STARING DOWN A VERY DARK CLIFF. THIS IS NOT A PERFECT DEAL BUT IT'S NECESSARY TO AVOID THAT AFFECTION CLIFF. AND GET DESPERATELY NEEDED MONIES OUT TO STRUGGLING TENANTS AND LANDLORDS. NOT SINCE IT WASN'T AND THE INITIAL DESCRIPTION OF THIS BILL I JUST WANT TO NOTE A FEW ELEMENTS THIS BILL. THAT WILL EXTEND TENANT PROTECTIONS BEYOND THE CURRENT EVICTION MORATORIUM. AFTER AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT WANTED TO AFFECT WE HEARD ABOUT SOME LANDLORDS WHO ARE ADDING SIGNIFICANT LATE FEES. APPLYING CURRENT TENANT PAYMENTS RETROACTIVELY TO BACKGROUND AND OTHER CHARGES. AS WELL AS CONCERNS RAISED BY TENANTS ABOUT UNPAID RENTAL DEBT ASSIGNED TO DEBT COLLECTORS. AS WELL AS TENANTS FACING CIVIL LAWSUITS FOR MISSED RENT. THANKS TO THE ADVOCACY OF THE STATEWIDE TEN COMMUNITY RELATED TO AB FIFTEEN. THIS BILL ADDS CRITICAL TENANT PROTECTIONS TO HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. AT A TIME WHEN TOO MANY RENTER HOUSEHOLDS ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. I WANT JUST NOTE THAT THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT OVER WITH THIS BILL. I DO SHARE THE CONCERN RAISED BY TENANTS THAT THE FACT THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THAT A TENANT RECEIVES. IS DETERMINED SOLELY BY THE COOPERATION OF A LANDLORD COULD RESULT IN OUTCOMES CONTROLLED BY THE TYPICAL POWER IMBALANCE BETWEEN TENANTS AND LANDLORDS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO AGGRESSIVELY MONITOR THIS PROGRAM IN REAL TIME. TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM AND OUR EFFORTS TO PREVENT EVICTIONS AND WITH THAT I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AROUND THIS. BOB WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND WE ARE GOING TO RECEIVE MONTHLY MONITORING. WANTED JUST UNDERSTAND WITH A LITTLE MORE GRANULARITY HOW THE ADMINISTRATION WILL PLAN TO TRACK THE RATE AT WHICH MONEY GOES OUT. AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF LANDLORDS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM- CERTAINLY WITH A LOT OF COMMUNITY NONPROFIT AND OTHER LOCAL PARTNERS. ADMINISTERING THIS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE CONSISTENT REPORTING AND DATA- ONE ALSO UNDERSTAND. AS THE MONEY GOES OUT HOW DO WE EVALUATE IF WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE- IS THERE MECHANISM TO DETERMINE FOR EXAMPLE THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC MAKEUP OF TENANTS AND LANDLORDS AND RECEIVING RENTAL. ASSISTANCE AND THEN. WANT TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S GONNA BE A MECHANISM FOR DETERMINING HOW MUCH CONSUMER DEBT TENANTS WERE RECEIVING. 25% OF THE RENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET IT IS. LONGER TERM WE KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A SUBSET OF TENANTS WILL STILL BE SADDLED WITH SIGNIFICANT DEBT. WE'VE GOT A MONITOR THAT VERY CLOSELY I JUST WANT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CURRENT THINKING OF THE MINISTRATION ON THIS IS I KNOW WE'VE HAD. SOME PRELIMINARY CONVERSATIONS BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY. AN ISSUE OF CONCERN I THINK FOR MANY. YES I'M GOING TO HAND IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AGENCY. GOOD MORNING I'M MY NAME IS LYNN BONTA CLEAVER AND THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF HOUSING AT BUSINESS CONSUMER HELPING AGENCY AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND WE'LL SEE IF I CAN GET ALL OF THEM TO PLEASE YOU PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I IF I MISSED ANY OF THE QUESTIONS. AND SO FIRST IN TERMS OF THE MONTHLY MONITORING THE PROCESS FOR THAT IS THAT FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING WITHIN THE STATE PROGRAM WE WILL HAVE A CONTROL A CENTRAL DATABASE THAT IS ABLE TO TRACK THAT INFORMATION- ON A NEAR REAL TIME BASIS SO APPLICATIONS ARE. ON STARTING AND WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS WILL BE COLLECTING ALL THAT INFORMATION AND BEING ABLE TO REPORT IN ON ON THAT ON THAT INFORMATION- I'M FOR JURISDICTION THAT PARTICIPATE THROUGH THE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM EACH TV WILL BE REQUIRING I'M WEEKLY REPORT. THAT ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION WHICH WILL THEN BE CENTRALIZED INTO THE CENTRAL SYSTEM TO FACILITATE AN AGGREGATED REPORT ACROSS THE STATE AND SO IT IS THE IT'S THE REQUIREMENT OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM AND WILL DESIGN AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- TO HEAR TO THAT TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TRACK AND THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN APPLICATIONS ARE- STARTED WHEN THEY STARTED THE PROCESS AND WHEN THEY ARE COMPLETED AND THEN WHEN GRANTED MINISTERED AS WELL. THAT WE CAN PEOPLE THE- ENTITY THE INTEREST THE OUTRAGE THAT THE PICK UP RATE AND THEN THE ULTIMATE THE COUPLE OUTCOME OF EACH APPLICATION. WE WILL HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT LANDLORDS OR TENANTS GETTING AS ENVISIONED WITHIN THE STATE PROGRAM- THE APPLICATION PORTAL CAN BE ACCESSED BY EITHER LANDLORD OR TENANT AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THE INFORMATION ABOUT AND- WHEN ONE PARTY START THE NET AT APPLICATION AND WHETHER OR NOT THE SECOND PARTY PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROCESS. AND WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO USE THAT INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO PUSH NOTIFICATIONS TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION FROM ALL PARTIES DROPPED THAT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS MUCH APPLICATION. HAS BEEN INITIATED. AND WE DO. BEING ABLE TO CLOCK AND FOR. ON RACE AND- APPLICANT ON BOTH TERMS OF LANDMARK AND TENANTS AND WE WERE CAN. TO THAT AND- AS AS ERICA- IN INTERNET COMMENT TO INTO COMMUNITY. AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE WE'RE TARGETING RESOURCES AND INFORMATION TO. YOU IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES DEPEND ON IT HAVE BEEN HIT HARDEST BY HOPE AND THEN ENTER OF THE AND- OF CONSUMER DATA AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. IF I'M UNDERSTANDIG THAT- THAT INFORMATION CORRECTLY WILL BE CAPTURING INFORMATION ABOUT AND THE AMOUNT OF RENTAL ARREARS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATED. AND ARE BEING REQUESTED AS PART OF THE PROBLEM I'M STILL A FIGHTER A LANDLORD OR TENANT INITIATE THE APPLICATION WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT THAT INFORMATION AND THEN RECORD AGAINST THE GROUP SAID THE ARREARS THAT HAVE BEEN WEAKENED- THAT HAVE BEEN PAID. TO THE LANDMARK PARTICIPATE BIRTH AND THE AMOUNT OF UNPAID ARREARS YEAH THE LAST. PAYMENT GO THROUGH THE TENANT PROPER. AND I BELIEVE I GOT ALL THE CONFIDENCE OF PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE. IS AN ELEMENT THAT I KNOW. I THINK AT A HIGH LEVEL YOU TO TOUCH ON AND I PER THAT- YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO SAY AT THIS IS. THIS BILL THESE BILLS WERE WERE OBVIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO CRAFT IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO MAJOR UNKNOWNS. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE SIZE THE TOTAL SIZE OF DEBT. AND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE ABLE TO COVER IT WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT POTENTIALLY THE BY DEMONSTRATION WILL PROVIDE MORE. BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW. THE OTHER MAJOR UNKNOWN WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL THIS TIME IS. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF LANDLORDS WILL AGREE TO ACCEPT THE 80% OF- OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN RETURN FOR GIVING ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS. I EXPECT IN THE COMING MONTHS WILL HAVE TO REVISIT THIS LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS GAPS. AND PROVIDE RELIEF TO ADDITIONAL TENANTS. WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT APPRECIATE LEADERSHIP'S COMMITMENT TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE NOT LEAVING TENANTS SADDLED WITH DEBT FOR REASONS THAT ARE NOT THEY'RE- NOT THEIR FAULT. AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT. IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S. WORK WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT PICTURE LOOKS LIKE AND I DO HOPE THAT THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE. CAN FACILITATE THE REGULAR OVERSIGHT ON THIS AS FREQUENTLY AS WE NEED TO- TO FIGURE THIS OUT MOVING INTO THE FUTURE BECAUSE I DO THANK. UP BEFORE JUNE THIRTIETH WILL HAVE TO MAKE SOME REAL DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE WILL LOOK LIKE. WITH THAT CONTACTED HER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER SMITH AND THEN TO MISTER LEE. AND FOR ANY MEMBERS WHO AREN'T ON THE DAIS- WERE MISTER LEE IS THAT'S WHERE WILL BE SPEAKER. SELF MISTER SMITH THANK YOU MISTER TURNER CAME. I'M LOOKING OF THE WHITE OR WHITE IN THIS CHIU AND WHAT THE PRICE. TO CHOOSE THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. AS THE ENTITY TO. ADMINISTER THIS NEW PROGRAM. AND WHAT CONFIDENCE. DO WE HAVE IN THE STATE. THAT CDFI HAS A CAPACITY THE EFFICIENCY. TO RUN THIS PROGRAM AND DISTRIBUTE THE MONEY QUICKLY BECAUSE THAT IS A PROCESS WE NEED TO GET THE MONEY OUT. TO THE LANDLORDS AND TO THE RENTERS THAT NEED ASSISTANCE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. YES MISTER SMITH- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS NOT A CDFI AT THIS POINT WE HAVE- AGENCY ARE DOING RESEARCH ON WHO COULD BE AT. A SOLID THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR- AND THEY WANT TO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID AND TO ADDRESS THIS PROGRAM QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I'M GONNA HAVE THIS QUESTION OVER TO AGENCY FOR THE PARTICULAR REGARDS TO THE ACTIONS THAT THEY TAKE THUS FAR- AND I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT SOME OF THE IMPORTANT EXPECTATIONS THEY HAVE ON THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR- WITH MY FOLLOW. A FELLOW COLLEAGUES TO MAKE SURE THE MONEY WAS DISTRIBUTED WHO IS GOING TO BE WATCHING OR THE OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THE MONEY IS DISTRIBUTED CORRECTLY. AND WE HAVE NO OTHER ISSUES IN THE ONE DEPARTMENT TO THE OTHER. I'M SURE IF I UNDERSTAND THAT THE U. S. TREASURY HAS SPENT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS DIRECTLY STATE AT THIS POINT AND THAT THOSE. THOSE DOLLARS WILL BE- IT USED CONTRACT WITH A THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR AND H. T. T. STATE AGENCY WILL BE HOLDING BACK LAW HOLD BACK. BUT I TELL. WE APPROVAL TO DO SO NOTHING HAS. MOVED FORWARD THIS ALL GREASED AT THIS POINT I'M LINKING OUR TO YOU FOR SOME MORE DETAILS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. AB AND TO THE OF THE- PARTY EMPLOYEE. I'M WITH WITH THE STATE FEEDBACK FROM THREE OH EIGHT EIGHT. WHICH IDENTIFY- INFORMATION ABOUT HER A- AND- SHALL. AND ALSO- IMPLANTED MATH THAT DENTURE THAT I AT AT. ADVOCATE UNITY EVERY WHO APPLY TO THE STAKEHOLDER. ON PROVIDE CONVEYED TO US. AND THEN WE HAVE SUDDENLY GONE THROUGH SERIES OF LISTENING- WITH. TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WRAPPED THE LAST YEAR. I'M STILL USING ALL THAT INFORMATION WE THEN BEGAN IF YOU DESIGN WHAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE THAT THAT THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS- TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO. WHAT THE FEEDBACK THAT WE WERE HEARING FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND JURISDICTION BUT ALSO TO THINK THROUGH THE PROCESSING AND- HOW TO MEET THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ACTUALLY. IT BECAME I'M AWARE OF THE- THAT THAT PROGRAM GRANDMOTHER IF I'M ISSUED BY THE US TREASURY. AND SO FROM THERE WE DID A NUMBER OF WORKSHOPS WITH DIFFERENT- PROGRAM AND IMPLEMENTERS TO BE ABLE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND CAPABILITIES AND BE ABLE TO DEFINE. WHAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT PARAMETERS SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND- SERVICES THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH. WITH THE WITH THIS PROGRAM POLLUTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK ONE OTHER THAN A MYSTERY. I FEEL IT IS WORKING I FEEL LIKE I'M HERE TO GIVE MY PUBLIC COMMENT RIGHT NOW BUT I ASSURE YOU I AM A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE- SO FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK MADABA JORDY LEADER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU AND LEADERSHIP FOR THE COMMITMENT TO KEEPING WORKING FAMILIES HOUSE DURING THIS PANDEMIC. IS AN IMMENSE ANXIETY AMONGST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HOMES. YOU KNOW I'M REMINDED LAST NIGHT DURING THE AMAZING. VIOLENT WINDSTORM THIS HAPPENING DURING LAST NIGHT IN SACRAMENTO THAT PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS. THEY WANT TO KNOW IF THEY HAVE THE SECURITY OF A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. AND THEY WANT TO HAVE S MUCH TIME TO KNOW THAT'S POSSIBLE WE ARE. FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE EVICTION MORE TERMS ARE TO EXPIRE AD I CANNOT TELL YOU THE AMOUNT. OF CALLS AND MESSAGES WE GET IN OUR OFFICE AND DIRECTLY TO ME ASKING. IS THIS GOING TO PASS WHAT ARE THE DETAILS ON HOW WE CAN ACCESS THESE FUNDS. I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT OF OUR LEADERSHIP. TO WORKING AT A SPEEDY DEAL AND GETTING OUT THE REALLY FUNDS AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND MAKING SURE THE EVICTION MORE TERMS EXTENDED EXTENDED TILL JUNE. ALTHOUGH I'M CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF THE PANDEMIC SO I DO THINK PROBABLY WILL BE REVISITING THIS CONVERSATION SOON. AND IN RIVAS IN CONCERT THE CONVERSATION. I REALLY HOPE THAT. WILL BE INCLUDING A TEN ADVOCACY GROUPS IN THIS BECAUSE THE TENANT ADVOCACY GROUPS. HAVE A LOT OF FRUSTRATION ANXIETY THAT I. RIGHTFULLY UNDERSTANDS I THINK I'M ONE OF THE FEW MEMBERS OF OUR STATE LEGISLATURE THAT IS NOT A PROPERTY OWNER. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT ANXIETY THAT YOU COULD BE. ONE MISSED PAYMENT AWAY. FOR HAVING SLEEP IN YOUR CAR. HAVE ANY COUCH SURF. AND IN WINTER NIGHTS LIKE THESE I'M REMINDED THAT A CAR EVEN LOOKING TO BE DRY. FEELS LIKE BEING IN A DRY REFRIGERATOR. IT IS VERY DEEPLY UNPLEASANT. WE DON'T WANT THAT TO BE HAPPENING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. IN ONE SURVEY THERE ARE MORE THAN A MILLION CALIFORNIA TENANTS. THERE BEHIND A RED AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. THAT'S ONE IN FIVE RENTERS IN THE STATE ONE IN FIVE. AND THAT'S INCLUDES HOME COUNTY SANTA CLARA ALONE. SO THE NEED IS REAL AND HIS IDEAS VERY MUCH REAL. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT TO KEEPING OUR FAMILIES HOUSE BUT I AM ALSO WORRIED THAT IN THIS NEGOTIATION IN THIS PROPOSAL IT DOES GIVE TOO MUCH POWER. TO LANDLORDS WHO TRADITIONALLY HAVE A POWER IMBALANCE OVER THE TESTS SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL BUT AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION AND I APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP COMMITMENT. TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AND KEEP THE DATA TRACKING TO MAKE SURE THE PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL CALIFORNIANS. SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS. LOOKING OVER THE BILL IF A LANDLORD OPTS INTO THE PROGRAM OR THE REQUIRED TO APPLY FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL TENANT THAT IS ELIGIBLE THAT OWES BACK RENT. AT ONE TIME. OR ARE THEY ALLOW DISCRETION TO PICK WHICH TENANT IS ALL OF THE PROGRAM. THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION OTHER THAN ONE ATTACK. YES CAN I TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT AGENCY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE AS ACTIVE AS A DIVISION THE LANDLORD COULD YOU EITHER THEY COULD EITHER APPLY IN A BATCH FOR ALL THE TIME OR THEY CAN DO SO ON A ROLLING BASIS. OKAY THANK YOU. MY SECOND QUESTION IS. UNDER THE PROPOSAL IF A LANDLORD OPT INTO THE PROGRAM. THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY. GIVEN 80% OF THE DEBT OUT. IF I IF I TENANTS APPLIES WHEN A LANDLORD DECLINES THEY ARE GIVEN THE 25% DEBT 25% DEBT OWED REQUIRED TO STATE HOUSE. THAT FEELS TO ME LIKE A DIRECT UNICAL INEQUITY AN IMBALANCE SO WHERE WOULD THE NUMBER BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND EIGHTY PUMP FROM. CAN I GET THIS ONE TO AMY AND AGENCY. HI AMY WE JUST NEED TO START TALKING. YOU'RE A MICROPHONE IS OFF. ALL IS IT LOOKS LIKE A MEANS- MICROPHONE IS OFF MEMBERS I'D WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU SOON- THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO SAY- THAT- OKAY LET'S GO. I'M SURE WINNER WHEN WE THOUGHT WHEN THE POLICE AFTER THE STRUCTURE THERE WERE A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE BOUNDING THE CONVERSATION TO BEGIN WITH IN THE FIRST IS THAT THE FEDERAL PROGRAM- AT REQUIRED FOR THAT THE OFFER GO TO EVEN GO TO THE LANDLORD AND THAT WE WORK WITH A LANDMARK- AND ONLY SHOULD THE LANDLORD NOT BE PARTICIPATING THEN DO WE THEN GO THROUGH TO THAT HAND ON THE BACK PART OF THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN WHEN WE WERE LOOKINGAT THE- THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE THERE WAS THAT THEY WERE THE PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE THE LANDLORD TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE BACK INTO THE ABILITY TO THAN TO BE ABLE TO- ARRAY THE REMAINING RENTAL ARREARS AND IF THERE'S A THOUGHT AROUND THE IF YOU GET TO THE TENANT PARTICIPATION THEN THAT'S FINE THEN THAT THAT 25% IS ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT THE TIME AND WILL CONTINUE TO A HOUSE UNDER THE EXTENSION OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS- BUT THE GOAL WOULD BE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE AS MUCH- RENTAL THAT AS POSSIBLE WHICH IS ACHIEVED. ONLY THROUGH THE DIRECT LANDMARK PAYMENT. OKAY THANK YOU. I DEFINITELY. THAT AND I UNDER. AND WANT TO INCENTIVE LAND FOR JUST SO I DO HAVE. THAT FOUGHT. IT DOES ODD TO ME THAT WHEN A LANDLORD APPRECIATE A PROACTIVE TENANT APPLYING FOR THEMSELVES. SO IT SEEMS QUITE PUNITIVE TO A TENANT WHO WOULD TAKE EFFORTS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS TO. APPLY FOR IT. SO I REALLY HOPE IN THE FUTURE IF WE HAVE MORE. FUNDS COVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WE ARE HOPEFUL FOR. THAT THIS SPLIT IN DEBT. DEBT PAYOFF ESSENTIALLY IS MUCH MUCH MORE EQUITABLE. SINCE OBVIOUSLY THE MONEY GOES ALANLAR DIRECTLY ANYWAYS IT DOESN'T POCKET INTO THE TENANT. ALL RIGHT WELL MY THIRD QUESTION IS THIS I'M- I APPRECIATE OVIOUSLY THE SPEED WITH ONE AND GETS THE MONEY OUT BY MARCH BUT I AM WORRIED THERE MIGHT BE A REPEAT AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS WHY THE DATA METRICS ARE IMPORTANT I AM WORRIED THERE COULD BE A REPEAT OF THE PPP LOAN FIASCO FROM TWENTY TWENTY- WE'RE BIG BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS. EIGHT UP THE LINE SHARES OF THESE FUNDS BEFORE SMALL BUSINESSES COULD APPLY. I HAVE THE SAME CONCERN THAT SMALL LANDLORDS MAY NOT GET THE CHANCE APPLY. THE OUTER NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN- SO HOW WILL WE ENSURE THAT SMALL LANDLORDS WHO MAY ONLY BE RENTING OUT THEIR SECOND HOMES OR TRIPLEX WITH A FEW TENANTS THAT THEY HAVE KEPT ON IN GOOD FAITH MAY NOT. WHO MAY NOT POSSESS THE RESOURCES THAT CORPORATE LANDLORDS HAVE HAVE PRIORITY IF NOT TACKLE ACCESS TO THESE REALLY FUNDS IN MARCH. YESTERDAY I'M JUST TO POINT OUT THAT- PART OF THE EXPECTATION OF THE THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR IS THAT THEY PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AS WELL AS RUN A- ROBUST COMMUNICATION OUTREACH PROGRAM TO- IT TO ALL THE PARTICIPANTS ACROSS THE STATE AND SO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US I THINK YOUR POINT. IS SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSIDERED IN THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH PPP THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MOST NEEDY- HOUSEHOLDS WOULD RECEIVE THIS SUPPORT AND SO THE- THE WAY THAT IN WHICH THE MONEY IT'S GOING TO BE ALLOCATED IS IN ROUNDS AND THAT FIRST ROUND. IS REALLY TO ADDRESS THE DEEPEST NEED IS FOR HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE BELOW 50% AREA MEDIAN INCOME. OR WHO HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR NINETY DAYS AND SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS THE DEEPEST NEED THERE IN THAT FIRST ROUND- SO THAT'S THE SORT OF THE PRIORITY GROUP AS YOU MENTION- BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT TO OUR REGION MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE SMALL LANDLORDS NOT THE BIG IS. THAT ARE ARE YOU KNOW THE DATE THAT THEY HAVE. THE SAME BENEFIT UP FOR THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU SO THAT'S A NEED BASED ON THE TENTH CORRECT. IT IS BASED ON THE TENTS YES SO I DO APPRECIATE THE KNOWLEDGE AT THE DEEPEST NEED IS BASED ON THE TENANT YEAH OBVIOUSLY THIS PROPOSAL DOES REFLECT THAT INEQUITY WHERE THE TENANT IF THEY APPLY WITH THE DEEPEST NEED GETS 25% OF THE DEBT PAID OFF NOW INSTEAD OF THE EIGHTY PERCENT. SO I HOPE IN THE FUTURE THAT WILL BE LOOKED AT MORE CLOSELY. THANK YOU SO MUCH THOSE ARE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO GO TO DOCTOR ARAMBULA THAN TO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- THE FIRST TIME. SOMETIMES WHEN WE GET THESE PROPOSALS LATER IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US AND I APOLOGIZE IF MY QUESTION IS OFF BUT I WANT TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING IF SOME OF THESE FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR OUR HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT. I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION LETTER WHERE THEY SPOKE ABOUT MULTIPLE PROGRAMS INCLUDING ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES CAL WORKS CHILD WELFARE AND FOSTER CARE. YES ARAMBULA SAID THESE FINES ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR RENTAL AND- LEASE AND NOT NOT AND- AND UTILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN THAT AS WELL SO NOT FOR SERVICES- HE- OF THESE FUNDS MAY BE USED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF AS WELL- BUT AGAIN ALL TOWARDS RENTAL ASSISTANCE. UTILITY PERFECT IN THAT THEN IS THE EXACT REASON WHY THEY ARE EXCLUDED I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ELEVATE THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THESE PROGRAMS. ARE LIMITED BY THE PROGRAMS THEMSELVES- THE PARTICIPANTS OFTENTIMES HAVE TO EITHER BE HOMELESS OR NEARLY ADDICTED BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE TO RECEIVE. ASSISTANCE AND SO I'M DEFINITELY TALKING ABOUT THE HOUSING AND DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM BE HOME SAFE PROGRAM WITHIN APS THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME AND THE HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM. C. W. D. AS RECOMMENDATION IS THAT HAVING SOME FLEXIBILITY AS AN INCREASED FUNDS WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER PREVENT THOSE WHO ARE ON SOCIAL SERVICES. FROM BEING AFFECTED AND BECOMING HOMELESS THERE'S A REAL ADVANTAGE FOR US TO BEING PROACTIVE AND TO HELP TO PREVENT THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY ON OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NETS TO. BEING EXACERBATED AND WORSENED AND JUST WANTED TO ELEVATE THAT CONVERSATION HERE TODAY AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO THIS ADDICTION MORATORIUM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO COME BACK AND HELP TO FILL SOME OF THOSE GAPS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THOSE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU'RE JUST GONNA DO A QUICK QUICK FOLLOW UP ON DR EMPHASIS ABOUT POINT AS WELL- THE POINT OF CLARIFICATION IS- THE MONEY CAN BE USED TO PAY UTILITIES AS WELL. BUT THE IF THE MONEY'S GOING TO THE LANDLORDS HOW WOULD DID TEN AND GET THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE TWO OF THESE. YES THE PRIORITY IS FOR THE RENTAL ARREARS- MISTER CHANG AND IF. UTILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COST OF THEIR FRIENDS THAT THEY WOULD BE COVERED- BUT AGAIN IT'S- THAT THE FOCUS OF THIS PROGRAM IS FOR RENTAL ARREARS. I WILL ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANY OTHER DETAILS IN REGARDS TO YOUR QUESTION. GOOD MORNING THIS IS AMY WILSON I HOPE THAT MIKE- TECHNICAL ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND YOU CAN HEAR ME- I'VE JUST WOULD CLARIFY THAT THE FEDERAL LAW. AS IT PRESCRIBES PAYMENTS TO. LANDLORDS SIMILARLY IT WOULD PRESCRIBE THE PAYMENT TO THE UTILITY PROVIDER- BUT AS ERICA- THAT MENTIONED THE ARE THE FOCUS OF THIS PROGRAM REALLY IS THE STABILIZING HOUSEHOLDS- THROUGH THE PRIORITIZATION OF- RENTAL ARREARS- AND THROUGH PAYMENTS LANDLORDS. OKAY THANK YOU WHAT WE'RE GONNA GO NOT TO MISS RIVAS. WHAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR LEADERSHIP OF BOTH HOUSES THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AMAZING BUDGET STAFF- FOR WORKING TO PREPARE THIS HEARING TODAY AND WORKING ON THIS PROGRAM- AS WE ARE DISCUSSING THIS BILL TODAY SOMEONE IS LOSING THEIR HOME. TO MANY FAMILIES ARE ON THE VERGE OF BEING UNABLE TO PAY THEIR RENT EVEN PRIOR TO COVE IT AND NOW THE THIS PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED THAT. WE KNOW THAT THE RICH HAVE GOTTEN RICHER DURINGTHE PANDEMIC AND THE POOR HAVE GOTTEN POORER DURING THIS PANDEMIC- WE HAVE COME TO APPRECIATE THOSE WHO WORK IN THE CENTRAL JOBS HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK TO SHIP OUR ORDERS TO PREPARE FOOD STOPPER GROCERY SHELVES WE'RE FACING A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S FACING WITH THE WORST HOMELESSNESS DISASTERS IN THE NATION. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO CRITICAL OF THAT THE STATE PROVIDE OF THIS PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES- WE NEED TO ACT AGGRESSIVELY AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE- AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE WORKING HARD TO ESTABLISH THIS PROGRAM AND GET IN GETTING IT UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- SO MY QUESTIONS ARE RELATED. TO THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION AND THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE OF WHILE EURO WE SOMETIMES WE GO TOO FAST AND WE DON'T EVALUATE- HOW ACCESSIBLE THE APPLICATION IS- FOR THOSE THAT ARE LESS TECHNOLOGY LITERATE AND ARE REALLY IN NEED- WILL THERE BE. SUPPORT OF FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT AS TECH LITERATE AS OTHERS- TO APPLY FOR THIS APPLICATION LIKE WITH APPLICATION BE OFFERED IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES- AND ALSO. WHAT ARE WE DOING OR WHAT WHAT WAIT ARE WE APPLYING- IN SELECTING THE THIRD PARTY- THAT WILL ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM. IN THEIR TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY AND THEIR EXPERIENCE- IN IN ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM VIA THE INTERNET LIKE THIS ONE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION MISTER BASS AND- YES ABSOLUTELY THAT THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTOR EXPECTATIONS INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP AN ONLINE PLATFORM WHICH WILL BE ACCESSIBLE- FOR THOSE- ACROSS THE STATE WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE I'M BUT TO YOUR POINT IN REGARDS TO THOSE FAMILIES- THOSE LANDLORDS WHO ARE NOT AS TECHNICALLY SAVVY- THAT WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS ALSO THAT THREE THIS CONTRACT- THE IMPLEMENTER WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND AGAIN THIS IS INFORMED BY A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION HAPPEN AROUND EIGHT THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT STAKEHOLDER WORK FOR- THAT THAT ENVISIONED- HOW HOW UP THIRD PARTY WOULD ASSIST- ACROSS THE STATE. AND VARIOUS POPULATIONS SOME OF WHICH AS YOU SAID MAY NOT BE- AS SAUDI ONLINE I'M I'M NOT GOING TO ASK MY- AGENCY. PARTNERS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY RIVAS AND THE IS ONE OF THE CORE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE ENVISION BUILDING AND THAT THE CONTRACT. AND WINTERS SAID MENTIONING THE POINT AROUND THAT TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT WHAT WE ARE LEARNING VERY QUICKLY IS THAT WHILE THERE ARE ON LIMITATIONS OFTEN IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO YOU AND ACCESS THE COMPUTER. AND MOBILE IS OFTEN HERE MUCH MORE AVAILABLE AND SO WE ARE REQUIRING THAT EVERYTHING BE A MOBILE BASED AS WELL AS AND ACTIVISTS. BY AND REGULAR COMPUTER AND WE'RE ALSO REQUIRING AND THAT THERE WOULD BE AT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT INCLUDED- MULTILINGUAL CALL CENTER- MULTILINGUAL AND. EMAIL AND TAX. SERVICES TO BE ABLE TO ACROSS. AND THEN ALSO IN WOULD BE THE M. THAT IN PERSON- BUT COPE AT THE AT. SUPPORT SERVICES- SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD BE- AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD ORIGINAL JURISDICTION ON THAT THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE CHIU BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE AND DIRECT SUPPORT Q. AND AN APPLICANT WHO NEEDED AN ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE AND BEING ABLE TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION. AND IN TERMS OF THE BILL WAIT- THAT WE WOULD. PUT ON DEATH THIS CAPABILITY AND I THINK IT'S A VERY PROMINENT FEATURE IN THE DESIGN- AS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE FEDERAL PROGRAM HAVE A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES IN TERMS OF RECORDING. AND BEING ABLE TO MANAGE A PRETTY COMPLEX AND DUPLICATION OF BENEFITS REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT HAVING I'M VERY VERY AND THE PAST DECADE TECHNOLOGY ON THE BACK AND TO BE ABLE TO. DO THAT YOU NEED TO DO THE DEED IS LOCATION MARK- BE ABLE TO MATCH THE APPLICATION BE ABLE TO AND PROTECTING DANTE AND BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT. THAT THEIR- THAT FRAUD APPAREILS THE FRAUD IS MINIMIZED THE GREATEST DEGREE POSSIBLE AND THOSE ARE ALL VERY VERY IMPORTANT CRITERIA AND THE FACT THAT CATIONS THAT WE WOULD ENVISION- THE OTHER THING TO DO I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT. NOT ONLY ARE IS THAT THE SERVICE PROVIDER THAT HAS THE TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE THAT THAT THAT THEY HAVE THE TECHNICAL EXPERIENCES WORKING IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY KOBE. AND SO HOW THAT COMMUNITY BASED FOCUS THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDED THAT THE TECHNICAL POLLUTION THAT THAT ME INDIVIDUAL WHERE THEY'RE AT. I'M SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE GREATEST THE CLASS AND COMPLETING APPLICATIONS. AND- DISTRIBUTING FONG. IF OKAY IF I MAY I WANTED TO JUST AT A COUPLE OF A POINTS RELAY TO- AND- I WANTED TO NOTE THAT- IN ADDITION- MATERIALS AND INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE STATE'S OUSING IS KEY WEBSITE- WHICH IS- AT IT OUR FIRST ON IT BOTH SENATE IT IS OFFERED IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH BUT THEN- MOVING BEYOND THAT TO THE- REQUIRED TENANT NOTIFICATIONS THAT ARE IN THE BILL- IN THE CIVIL CODE SECTIONS ELEVEN SEVENTY NINE POINT OH THREE AND- FOR- THOSE ARE REQUIRED TO BE TRANSLATED. IN THE LANGUAGE BEFORE PROVIDED IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THE- THAT THE LEASE WAS DEVELOPED IN AND THE- STATE DOES- PROVIDE THOSE NOTIFICATIONS TRANSLATED IN THE FIVE MOST PREVALENT LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN- IN THE STATE- ADAM AT AS A STARTING POINT AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT- RELATIVE TO- IMMIGRATION STATUS- THE PROGRAM- IS SILENT ON THAT MATTER AND- WE HAVE- ALSO INCLUDED AT THE OR ARE AMONG OUR INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR. ARE ON THAT THEY THINK CREATIVELY WHEN IT COMES TO IDENTITY VERIFICATION- RECOGNIZING THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS ALL THE SAME TRADITIONAL. DOCUMENTATION AND SIMILARLY IN THOSE REQUIRED NOTIFICATIONS I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT IN THE CIVIL CODE THERE IS A POINT- ABOUT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE- AT BEING AVAILABLE AND- THAT- THE PROGRAM MAY BE AVAILABLE YOU MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM REGARDLESS OF YOUR- CITIZENSHIP OR IMMIGRATION STATUS. THANK YOU WHERE TO GO TO NEXT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR WOULDN'T IN A SMALL NUMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- SO. IF YOU'RE A LARGE COUNTY FOR OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE YOU'LL GET IT YOU CAN GET A DIRECT BLOCK GRANTS FROM IT IS THAT H. CD OR WHERE IS THAT BLOCK GRANT COMING FROM. I JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SORRY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION WILL RECEIVE A DIRECT- GRANT FROM THE US TREASURY. IN ADDITION TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT CALIFORNIA'S RECEIVING DIRECTLY FROM THE US TREASURY. WILL BE ALLOCATED OUT TO ENTITIES BASED ON- POPULATION OR POPULATION BASIS. AND SO THOSE ENTITIES- YOU YOU HAVE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ENTITIES OF. POPULATIONS ABOUT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND YES THEY WOULD ALSO BE. ELIGIBLE FOR A BLOCK GRANT THROUGH THE STATE PROGRAM AND THEY CAN DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO. PARTICIPATE IN THAT BLOCK GRANT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PROVISIONS OF THAT STATE RENTAL PROGRAM BUT SO THAT THEY COULD RECEIVE TO BLOCK GRANTS ONE IS A DIRECT ONE FROM THE U. S. TREASURY AND A SECOND ONE WOULD BE. THROUGH- EACH CD. SO START OF COUNTIES THAT ARE GREATER THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE YOU SAYING COULD RECEIVE ADDITIONAL BLOCK GRANTS ADDITIONAL. FOR ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT OTHER COUNTIES MIGHT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE. SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE A DIRECT GRANT ALREADY FROM THE FENCE AND THAT THEY WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE GRANTS- GRANT DOLLARS FROM THE STATE PROGRAM- I PER PERSON- PER POPULATION BASED. YEAH AND THAT'S NOT JUST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT'S EVERY EVERY. JURISDICTION IN ACCOUNT- IN THE IN THE STATE COULD RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF DOLLARS. SO COULD A PROPORTIONALLY RECEIVE LARGER COUNTIES PROPORTIONALLY RECEIVE MORE MONEY THAN PER CAPITA THAN SMALLER COUNTIES. SO I MENTION THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION CARVE OUT FOR SMALL COUNTY. AND THAT IS A FLOW THAT CREATES A FLOOR THAT IS ACTUALLY TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN THEY WHAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY HAVE RECEIVED IF YOU ARE LOOKING JUST OUT OF HER POPULATION BASIS UNDERSTANDING NEEDS AND SMALL COUNTRIES AND CITIES. WITHIN THOSE COUNTIES- WAS THE PURPOSE AND THE RATIONALE BEHIND HAVING A LARGER CAR ABOUT THAT. APPRECIATE THAT BUT YOU DID REGISTER MY QUESTION- IT COULD. BE HARDER TO. POTENTIALLY RECEIVE MORE PER CAPITA. THAN RESIDENTS OF SMALLER COUNTIES THAT WAS MY QUESTION I UNDER I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAID. BUT WE SAW THROUGH THE CURES ACT THAT SMALLER COUNTIES GOT DISPROPORTIONATELY HIT- WHEN IT CAME TO COBIT RELIEF SO I'M TRYING TO ENSURE THAT. WE GET FAIR TREATMENT I REPRESENT FIVE COUNTIES THEY'RE ALL LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN THE WAY I'VE SEEN THIS IS THAT IF YOU'RE A BIG COUNTY YOU CAN GET MONEY DIRECTLY FROM THE FEDERAL TREASURY AND YOU GET DIRECT MONIES DIRECTLY SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT I'M A SMALLER COUNTY. I HAVE TO GO THROUGH ANOTHER PROCESS. THIS FEELS LIKE THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT WHICH HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE MY DISTRICT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE KINDS OF THINGS SO THIS I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE YOU KNOW IS IT GOING TO BE FAIR PER CAPITA. NUMBER ONE. CROSS THE BOARD. BECAUSE THERE'S THAT THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SMALLER COUNTIES. HAVE LOWER COST OF LIVING AND THAT'S A FALLACY BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU IT'S NOT TRUE- AND- I JUST WANT TO ASSURE. THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA END UP IN A SIMILAR SITUATION WHERE. WE'RE SHORT CHANGED BECAUSE WE OFTEN ARE. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE THINGS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ABILITY TO TAP INTO THIS TO MOBILE DEVICES AND INTERNET AND ALL THAT. DOESN'T WORK IN A LOT OF THE DISPLAY AREA THAT I REPRESENT. YOU CAN DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY HIGHWAY ONE OF ONE FROM MY HOME TO THE NORTHERN PART OF MY DISTRICT IN 50% OF THAT HIGHWAY THERE'S NO CELL COVERAGE. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE INTERNET ACCESS WE DON'T HAVE MOBILE. AND THEY ARE BEHIND ON THEIR RENT OUT THERE HOW WE CAN REACH THEM. YES I'M GONNA TURN THE QUESTION IN REGARDS TO- PER PERSON- ALLOCATION TO COLLEAGUES BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT. AGAIN THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE PROVIDED BOTH BY EACH CD TO. AND THAT THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR IS BOTH A TECHNOLOGICAL AND ALSO- WHAT'S ON THE GROUND SO WALKING THROUGH COMMUNICATING WITH- LANDLORD AND TENANT. ADVOCACY GROUPS AND OTHERS ON THE GROUND AND IT'S AN ALL NECESSARILY. TECHNOLOGICAL SUCH YOUR POINT NOT AT NOT ALL POPULATIONS ARE EITHER SAUDI ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WITH THOSE SETTINGS SO ONE I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AS ONE MEANS OF COMMUNICATING THAT INFORMATION TO. BIG AND SMALL COUNTIES- AND LYNN OR- ANYTHING- ANY OTHER DETAILS ON THAT BEFORE YOU DO THAT. I JUST LIKE TO SAY FREE TO HISTORICALLY THAT EXTRA LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY HAS BEEN REALLY DIFFICULT FOR SMALLER COUNTIES HISTORICALLY. AT HOUSE AND SO. A TO A THIRD. THAT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS POINT MAY HAVE GOOD TIES TO KEEP. THESE MAY NOT- I DON'T HAVE A REAL COMFORTABLE FEELING WITH ABOUT SOME OF THIS RIGHT NOW AND- YOU KNOW I WANT I'M GONNA SUPPORT WHAT WE DO HERE. BUT I'M TELLING YOU NOW THAT BASED ON MY PAST EXPERIENCE WITH THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES. I DON'T HAVE A WARM AND FUZZY FEELING ABOUT THIS SO I'M HOPING THAT I'M WRONG- AND- BUT IF I'M NOT. YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT IT. I CAN I CAN- I CAN HELP TO ANSWER AND UNDERSTOOD WERE LATE TO THE DEAN OF THE POPULATION DISTRIBUTION I THINK ONE THING THAT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE THE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS AND- WILL RECEIVE A DIRECT FEDERAL ALLOCATION AND THAT COMPRISES ABOUT 95% OF THE POPULATION. AND SO IF THAT THE UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND I'M COMMUNITIES ARE THOSE THAT THE MAKE UP 5% OF THE POPULATION AND SO IN LOOKING AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE STATE PORTION AND WE SENSUALLY DOUBLED UP SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE SAME THEY WOULD HAVE THE SAME PER CAPITA- FORMULA AS THE JURISDICTIONS THAT WERE REPEATING THE DIRECT APPLICATION AS WELL. AND DO WE REALLY DO THINK THAT WE WORKED TO CREATE A GEOGRAPHICAL POPULATION EQUITY WITHIN- WITHIN THAT STRUCTURE AND THE OTHER THING THAT AND WE NEEDED INCLUDE AND THE LANGUAGE IS THAT ORDERED DICTION THAT ARE RECEIVING IT AT THAT THAT OFTEN FOR A STATE ALLOCATIONS FOR THE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM. THERE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION WITH ACROSS THERE RIGHT ACROSS THEIR- THEIR JURISDICTION AS WELL AND WE HOPE THAT I WILL CREATE JUST ONE MORE LAYER OF DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN- CITIES AND CITIES AND UNINCORPORATED AREAS WITHIN WITHIN A COUNTY THAT IS ELIGIBLE FOR THAT THAT RESERVATION. AND THEN AS IT RELATES TO- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE OUR REACH WITHIN- WITHIN SMALLER JURISDICTION- THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE BEEN VISION AT THE THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR WOULD BE- REQUIRED TO HAVE A STRONG PARTNERSHIP ON BOTH IN IN PLACE ALREADY AND THEN. NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH DOUBTLESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS A VERY LASER FOCUSED ON I'M GETTING THE INFORMATION INTO THE HANDS OF- OF INDIVIDUALS ALL ACROSS THE STATE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS THAT ARE ARE- AT. HARD HARDER TO REACH- FOR MANY REASONS. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE IF YOU HAD THE SAID ASID THE AND MILLION FOR THESE CAN. THEY WOULDN'T GOTTEN PROPORTION MONEY RIGHT. THE WAY IT WAS SET UP TO IF YOU HAD TO SET THAT ASIDE CONSCIOUSLY. WHAT I THOUGHT MIGHT HAPPEN WOULD HAPPEN RIGHT. RIGHT BECAUSE OF THE ALLOCATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YES BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE CORRECTED FOR THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL WITHIN THE PROGRAM. OKAY THANK YOU. I THINK YOU WERE GOING TO GO TO SOMEONE MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO ECHO IT AND THINK- MY COLLEAGUE DR WOODS FOR. HIS COMMENTS AND CONCERNS FOR OUR ROLE AREAS I SHARE MANY OF THOSE- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- PROPORTION MEN OR EQUITY QUESTION IN ENSURING THAT- WERE ABLE TO GET. RESOURCES AND FUNDING THERE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE. COMES INTO THE EFFICIENCY. ON HOW THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE MEASURED- WE'VE SEEN A AND I GET THESE CALLS ALL THE TIME I MEAN ARE. THE TWO ONE ONE LINE FOR GETTING HELP WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON CONTINUES TO CRASH. WE'VE SEEN STATE WEBSITES FROM DMV EDT EVEN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONTINUE TO CRASH. AND I HAVE A CONCERN THAT AS THIS ROLLS OUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. EVEN MORE OF A PROBLEM KEEPING OUR BASIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE UP- ME IN YET ANOTHER WEBSITE WILL CRASH- IT'S NOT. SO IT IS MY FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE. TO ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEMS DO NOT CRASH LIKE ALL THE OTHERS- AS THIS PROGRAM ROLLS OUT. CAN I ASK ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM AGENCY TO RESPOND TO THAT. ABSOLUTELY. YES THANK I CAN I CAN TAKE THAT ERICA AND THAT IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE AND- REALLY RESEARCHING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE LEARNING LESSONS FROM AND EXPERIENCES BOTH WITHIN THE STATE AND WITHIN OTHER STATES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. AND WE THINK pIS PROVIDE A METRIC WITHIN OUR OUR WEBSITE PROGRAM. IT WOULD REQUIRE- AT CERTAIN REDUNDANCIES- REALLY LEAN ON BEING ABLE TO LEAN ON ENACT A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE- YOU KNOW THE RIGHT BACKBONE- TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE USE THAT WE CAN IMAGINE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO DO IS REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SETTING UP WITH THE- THE APPLICATION PROCESS IN A WAY. THAT THAT DOES NOT- YOU KNOW LEADERS AND AN IMMEDIATE CRASH THE THINGS YOU CAN DO FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE- HAVING A FIRST TO GAUGE WHERE IF THE APPLICATION GO THEN BUT YOU DON'T. YOU DON'T UPLOAD DOCUMENTS AND SO LET ME. THE ELEMENTS LIKE THAT RIGHT RIGHT THERE THIS FOR THOSE OF US IN AND RURAL AREAS- THE GIN LIKE MY COLLEAGUE SAID. THERE ISN'T A. UPLOAD ON TO THE INTERNET. THERE IS A- VERY. CONCERNED PERSON STRUGGLING TO CALL A ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER FOR TWO ONE ONE. TO GET THROUGH TO GET ASSISTANCE. SOME OF THEM ESPECIALLY IN MY AREA IT'S A HIGHLY TINO AREA DON'T EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH. SO THEY'RE THEY'RE CALLING TO GET HELP. AND THEN BEING REDIRECTED TO A WEBSITE WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD INTERNET. OR THE THERE'S NOT ACCESS IN THAT AREA BECAUSE IT'S SO FAR OUT IN THE WHOLE ROLE BROADBAND ISSUE AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE'RE ALSO DEALING WITH. SO IS THERE GOING TO BE A CALL CENTER SET UP. IT'S ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO FALL APART AND CRASH. SO OUR PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY CALL IN WHATEVER LANGUAGE THEY NEED TO CALL IN WITH. TO GET HELP IN SOMEBODY LIKE IN THAT CALL CENTER THAT'S GOING TO FILL OUT THIS APPLICATION FOR THEM- SO THEY CAN RECEIVE THE CELL THEY THAT IS ONE OF MY GREATEST CONCERNS RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE EVERYBODY THAT I TALKED TO ON THE LOCAL LEVEL IS TELLING ME THESE THINGS KEEP CRASHING. AND EVEN FR THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO CALL WHEN. THEY I MEAN SOME ARE PRIVATE SECTOR FOLKS IN IN I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE. BOY IS THERE GOING TO BE A CALL CENTER THAT'S GONNA WALK THESE PEOPLE THROUGH THIS IN IN HOUSE STABLE IS THAT GONNA BE. THANK YOU FOR RENT. YES THERE'S GOING TO BE A CALL CENTER TO GET THESE PEOPLE HELP ME. YES THEY'RE GOING TO BE A CALL CENTER TO GET PEOPLE HELP- AND THE WAY THAT WE ENVISION THAT THERE WOULD BE A MULTILINGUAL CALL CENTER. WE WOULD SET THE STANDARD FOR NO MORE THAN A TEN MINUTE WAIT TIME WITH THE CALL BACK FEATURE. AND TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUAL HAD- PROMPTNESS IN THEIR ROOF IN THE RESPONSE TIME BUT ALSO UNCERTAINTY THAT THEY WOULD BE CALLED BACK IF THE CALL CRIME WAS LONGER THAN TEN MINUTES. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROVIDERS IN THE MARKET THEY THAT- HANS SYSTEMS THAT HAVE THEM YOU KNOW. UP TO TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES I'M AT A CALL CENTER SO YOU CAN BE ABLE TO BE ROUTE YOU CAN ROUTE THE CALLER TO SOMEBODY WHO SPEAKS THE LANGUAGE OF THEIR CHOICE. AND CAN BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM AND WORKING THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT IS A BIT USEFUL DON'T WHERE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND- HAVING THROUGH THE PROGRAM AND- I'M INTEREST AS A THEORY OF COMMUNITY BASED PARTNER. THAT CAN ALSO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE- MORE LOCALIZED- SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO THE INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS WITH WELL. AND THEN THAT CAN LOOK LIKE ANYTHING FROM YOU KNOW- ACCESS ACCESS TO ACCESS TO COMPUTERS ACT THE PARENTS. WERE LIVING INDIVIDUALS YOU HAVE ON THE MOBILE CAPABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO HELP SOMEBODY THAT THEIR APPLICATION. AND SO YES THERE IS DEFINITELY A CALL CENTER- ENVISIONED ENOUGH ENOUGH. PROPOSAL- BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT MORE. OKAY IN THE MY FIVE PLAN I HAVE FOR YOU. THE IGGY THIS IS THE EFFICIENCY QUESTION WHAT ARE THE MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS THAT YOU ALL ARE PUTTING FORWARD WHAT WHAT IS YOUR SCORING METRICS TO DETERMINE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY BEING EFFICIENT AND WORKING SO WHEN IT WHEN PEOPLE COME BACK YOU KNOW TWO WEEKS AFTER THIS LAUNCHES A MONTH AFTER THIS LAUNCHES X. CETERA WHAT WHAT IS THAT SCORING METRICS THAT YOU ALL HAVE PREPARED TO JUDGE HOW WILL THIS PROGRAMS WORKING SO WE KNOW WHAT TO LOOK AT TO FIX IT ALONG THE WAY. BECAUSE SO FAR WITHOUT EVERY PROGRAM WE SEEN ROLLOUT IN THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS THERE THERE IS NO SCORING METRICS THEY WERE NOT BEING SHARED THE DATA- BUT WE'RE LITERALLY NOT FINDING OUT INFORMATION UNTIL IT'S IN THE PRESS- AND IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING FOR ALL THE MEMBERS ACROSS THE BOARD SO I'M ASKING YOU UP FRONT WHAT THAT METRICS LOOKS LIKE SO AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY SPECIALLY AS WELL COMING INTO. BUDGETARY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SCORING METRICS IS SO AS WE START OUR BUDGET SESSIONS ARE SUB COMMITTEES. WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. SURE MISTER- MATHIS AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM IS REALLY IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY- THERE THERE ARE TRUST ISSUES WE UNDERSTAND- BASED ON. BASED ON OTHER OTHER PROGRAMS AND SO ONE THING I WOULD KNOW IS THAT OVERSIGHT- PROVIDED. I HAVE THE LEGISLATURE WE ARE ATTEMPTING- TO HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY AND MARK MORE OVERSIGHT THERE WILL BE MONTHLY RECORDINGS BUT JUMPING SEE IN REGARDS TO METRICS WHICH I WILL TURN OVER TO MY- COLLEAGUES TO GIVE YOU THE DETAILS EARNING BUT THE THOSE MONTHLY- REPORTS ARE TO HELP KEEP. YOU INFORMED AS WELL AS OURSELVES IN PREPARATION. FOR POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES OR THINGS THAT NEED TO OCCUR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THE TP A THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR- AS WE COLLECT THOSE METRICS WE HOPE THAT THIS IS AN INTERACTIVE PROCESS EVEN THOUGH IT'S A IT'S A SHORT DURATION IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS THAT WERE ALWAYS GETTING BETTER AND BEING INFORMED. NOT JUST BY THE THINGS THAT CRISTINA LIKE WITH THE PPP PROGRAM AND A LESSONS LEARNED THERE BUT LESSONS LEARNED- WITHIN THE PROGRAM ITSELF AND SO I'M I'LL TURN TO EITHER LAND OR ANY FOR THE DETAILS REGARDING THE METRICS THAT WILL BE COLLECTED ENSURE THAT. THE LEGISLATURE IN THOSE MONTHLY REPORT. THANK YOU. SURE AND- ONE THING I WOULD MENTION- VERY QUICKLY AS WELL AS THAT THAT HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WILL HAVE A PROGRAM MANAGEMENT TEAM THAT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AND THEY YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM SO BOTH THE- THAT THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR COMPONENT AS WELL AS THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BLOCK GRAHAM- OF THE STATE QUESTION THAT ARE ARE ISSUED TO YOU- JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT BLACKED% OUT BLOCK GRANTS AND THERE WILL BE A COHESIVE CENTRAL POINT OUT HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THAT OVERSEES THAT THE HOLISTIC NATURE OF THIS PROGRAM. AND IN TERMS OF THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THEY ARE SOLD OUT BY THE BY THE US TREASURY AND THEY INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT- B. AT THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AT THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PROCESSED AND THEN ALL OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION INCOME INFORMATION GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ETCETERA THAT ACCOMPANIES ALL OF THIS APPLICATION I'M SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CLOCK WILL BE LOOKING AT IT BOTH FROM HE CLIENT EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH THE SYSTEM. AND THE IMPLEMENTERS IN A WAY THAT- IS IT HELPFUL SIMPLE- AND THEN THAT YOU KNOW HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE TRUCK THAT THEY MAY BE FEELING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC- BUT THEM ALTHOUGH WILL BE LOOKING AT IT FROM A VERY QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE RECORDINGTHAT TRACK- THAT ARE BOTH REQUIRED THAT ARE REQUIRED BY BY THE TREASURY AND WILL BE MONITORING. THOSE ON A ON A WEEKLY AND MONTHLY BASIS. OKAY SO YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK AT. QUALITY BUT- FOR QUANTITATIVE VERSUS. THE MEAN. IT'S WOULD. DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE. THE METRICS LAID OUT WHEN ARE WE GETTING A COPY OF THAT IS- JUST SIMPLY SAYING OH WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW WHAT THE FEDS SAY I MEAN THAT THAT'S FANTASTIC BUT- WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO SPELL THAT OUT SO THE PUBLIC ACTUALLY KNOWS. WHAT THAT METRIX'S. SURE SURE HE- YES THAT'S ALL OF THE DIMENSIONAL BE SHARED PENDING ON THE B. AT THIS BUILDING ENACTED- WE WOULD THEN GO THROUGH A VERY RAPID ON PROGRAM- COMPLETION WHERE WE WOULD DO THE FULL PROGRAM DESIGN AND ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE- THE STRUCTURES- THE STRUCTURE IS VERY CLEAR WE WOULD DO A FULL ROLLOUT WE WOULD EXPLAIN ALL THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS WORK WITH ALL OF THE PARTICIPATING PARTIES AND THAT INFORMATION AT ALL THE PUBLIC AND THAT MEANT MUCH MOST OF THAT AS IT STANDING COMPLETION. I SEE I THINK THAT BILL BEFORE IT ROLLS OUT SO EVERYBODY CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IT VERSUS AFTER YOU GET YOUR FIRST. ROUND TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE THING YOU WERE GOING TO GO TO MISTER. BUT THERE AGO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A REALLY CHALLENGING PROBLEM IN FRONT OF US- AND- THINK ABOUT THREE MAJOR ISSUES WE HAVE A DEADLINE FOR TENANT PROTECTIONS THAT IN FRONT OF US WE HAVE THE FEDERAL- REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF THE OF THE FUNDING THAT THEY'RE SENDING US- IN ADDITION TO THAT AS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU POINTED OUT. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF UNKNOWNS AND SO I REALLY WANT TO- APPRECIATE AND CONGRATULATE THE LEADERSHIP- THE MAJORITY LEADER REYES AND OF PARTICULAR HOUSING CHAIR CHIU- FOR COMING UP WITH REALLY INTELLIGENT AND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MANY OF THE CHALLENGES- THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US AND ALL OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT- MR CHU IDENTIFIED AT THE BEGINNING OF. OF HIS COMMENTS SO- OVERALL- THIS IS A GOOD PROGRAM AND IT WORKS- MY COMMENTS ARE. SIMPLY THAT- THERE ONE AREA I HOPE THAT IT MERITS FURTHER ATTENTION AS WE ARE TRYING TO EVALUATE THIS BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE WHEN THIS EXPIRES- IS THAT THE TENANT. NOTIFICATION WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT ATTENDANT WHO IS BEHIND IN THEIR RENT. IS COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED WITH LOTS OF THINGS IN LIFE AND THE IDEA THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MONITOR WHETHER THEIR LANDLORD APPLIED. AND NOW DO THEY GET TO APPLY THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THAT JUST WHEN THE TIRE MEETS THE ROAD THAT'S GOING TO BE THE REAL DIFFICULT THING FOR THE TEST. THEY HAVE PERHAPS A LOCAL- TENANT PROTECTION ORDINANCE IN PLACE THAT THEY WILL CONFUSE WITH THE STATE SENATE PROTECTION- THAT IS IN PLACE AND THEN THEY HAVE ALL OF THESE OTHER. THINGS TO FOR NOTIFICATION SELF. HI I'M THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM AT ALL I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE WHAT WAS CREATED HERE. IT IS AN ALERT THAT I HOPE WE CAN WATCH THAT AS WE'RE TRYING TO GATHER THE FEEDBACK BOTH WITH THE STAFF AND- CERTAINLY WITH ALL THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. WE'RE NOT GONNA MISTER KILEY. A GOOD MORNING I WANT TO PICK UP ON AN ANSWER YOU GAVE IN RESPONSE ONE OF MR MATHIS IS QUESTIONS ABOUT LOOKING THE OTHER STATES WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE I. T. ISSUES- SINCE YOU KNOW ALL THE STATES ARE IN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THIS NEW FEDERAL PROGRAM I'D IMAGINE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT APPROACH IS BEING WORKED OUT. ACROSS THE COUNTRY I COULD YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. HOW YOU'VE WORKED WITH OTHER STATES TRIED TO LOOK FOR BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE BEING ADOPTED ELSEWHERE. WHEN THANK YOU YEAH AND REMEMBER KILEY THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB OF BRINGING ALL THE STATE TOGETHER AND TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS- DISCUSS THE NEEDS THAT ISSUES INVOLVED- SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR STATE I'M SO THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE PRIMARY RATE THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONNECTED- THROUGH NATIONAL AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN BE IN THE STATE TOGETHER AND THEN WE HAVE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF THE STATE TO STATE- CALL WITH AND OTHER STATES THAT SHARE THANK CHARACTERISTICS ARE CONCERNED THAT. POPULATION AND COMPLEXITY. OKAY WELL I YEAH I'M ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT AND I DIDN'T COURAGE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO CONTINUE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY CALIFORNIA HAS NOT PERFORMED WELL. IN MANY DIMENSIONS OF THIS COVERT RESPONSE COMPARED TO OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY I HAVE A QUOTE HERE FROM SENATOR SCOTT WIENER OF SAN FRANCISCO. WHO SAYS I AM CONCERNED ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE ROLE OUT OF RENT RELIEF GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS DURING THE PANDEMIC PANDEMIC WITH THINGS LIKE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. AND VACCINES AND OF COURSE WE COULD HAVE ADDED A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER THINGS WERE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AMONG THE WORST STATES IN THE COUNTRY SO. YOU KNOW AND- WE SAW FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE EDT FRAUD ISSUE THE DA'S THERE SO JUST LOOK WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING. THEY FIGURED OUT SO I JUST HEARD THE ADMINISTRATION. JUST TO LOOK AT STATES THAT HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB WITH THINGS LIKE THIS AND COPY WHAT THEY'RE DOING BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IF OUR OWN SOLUTIONS ENDED UP WORKING OUT WELL. ON THIS ISSUE WOULD BE A DRAMATIC BREAK FROM PRECEDENT WITH ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES. THAT WE FACED RECENTLY. SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT- YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT RELIEF WHICH A LOT OF FOLKS. ABSOLUTELY NEED. BUT WHEN YOU REALLY TALK TO PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANTED THEY WANTED NOT NECESSARILY RELIEF FROM THE GOVERNMENT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO EARN A PAYCHECK AGAIN. AND CALIFORNIA HAS HAD THE MOST STRINGENT RESTRICTIONS ON WORK OF ANY STATE. IN THE COUNTRY. AND BY THE WAY THAT EXISTED EVEN BEFORE- THE LOCKDOWNS WE'VE THE ONLY STATE IN THE BAND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING. FOR EXAMPLE AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING PEOPLE THE UNEMPLOYMENT CHECKS THAT THEY NEED. AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO THE LATTER THE LEGISLATURE'S PROVIDED SOME MODICUM OF OVERSIGHT BUT IT HASN'T SOLVED ANY OF THE PROBLEMS THE BACKLOG IS ABOUT AS- LARGE AS HAVE BEEN. AND SO I WOULD JUST- ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE THIS LEGISLATURE TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN TRYING TO ACT QUICKLY ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET BACK TO WORK. AND THEN THE PROBLEMS WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE HERE I WOULD NOT NEARLY BE AS MUCH OF AN OBSTACLE OR IS L. OR IS THAT AS BIG AS THE- AS THEY ARE. AS AYE AYE THE CONCERNS OF THE MEMBERS MAKE CLEAR SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO MEMBER S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHY WE'RE HERE- WE'RE TRYING TO EXTEND SOMETHING THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER TRUE IN AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT WITH HOMELESS MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND FINALLY GOT AS AN EXTENSION FOR OUR TENANTS SO THAT THEY CAN AVOID EVICTION WHEN THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER THERE WAS NO REAL PROTECTION FOR THE LANDLORDS WERE ASKING THE LANDLORDS JUST TO WAIT. NOW THAT WE RECEIVED TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE NOW GET TO EXTEND THAT MORATORIUM. PUT IN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO AN AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT BUT NOW WE ALSO GET TO TELL THE LANDLORDS NOW YOU'RE PART OF THE EQUATION YOU HELD OFF. ON GETTING YOUR ROUNDS NOW WE'RE GOING TO PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET TO GIVE YOU SOME OF YOUR MONEY. 80% IF THEY ACCEPT THAT. THEY HAVE TO WRITE IT OFF THE TENANT NO LONGER HAS TO ALSO ANY LATE FEES ANY OTHER FEES THAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT. AND THEN HOPEFULLY THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY THE RENT THERE AFTER WE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO UNDER THE PROGRAM. HELP THEM WITH THE 25% THE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE PUT INTO SB NINETY ONE AND I THINK THAT. IT STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE. THAT'S INTENDED TO. PREVENT THAT WAVE OF EVICTIONS THAT ARE OTHERWISE GOING TO DEVASTATE OUR COMMUNITIES. FEBRUARY ONE WE WOULD IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS FEBRUARY ONE BEGIN THE EVICTIONS SO WE'RE- FINALLY ABLE TO REACH SOME SORT OF A BALANCE. AND IN PERFECT BALANCE I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO THOSE WERE THE FIRST HIS FIRST COMMENTS AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH HIM IT'S IN PERFECT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE HAS TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. I ALSO. I APPRECIATE THAT IN SB NINETY ONE- IT NOT ONLY DOES IT EXTEND TO THE FICTION MORATORIUM BUT IT ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT. THE MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES- THAT BECAUSE OF THE IS THIS PANDEMIC THE CUPBOARD NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND THIS IS DONE THROUGH THE PROGRAM PRIORITIZATION PROVISIONS UNDER THE STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. SO THOSE MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED ARE GOING TO BE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE THESE BENEFITS. AND I WOULD CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO. UNDER THE- THE VALUATION OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE IT'S UNDER THE LETTER YOU PROGRAM PRIORITIZATION. THE FACT THAT THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS REQUIREMENT INCLUDES THAT THEY ALSO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY LEVEL PARTNERS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE IN AND DOCTOR WORDS AND MISSED ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE RENTERS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PAY THE RENT SINCE MARCH OF LAST YEAR THEY'VE ALREADY COMMUNICATE WITH SOMEBODY IN THOSE ARE USUALLY IN THE COMMUNITY. SO THE FACT THAT THIS AGREEMENT THIS BILL IS GOING TO REQUIRE THAT WHOEVER IS GOING TO BE IN CHARGE HAS THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THE THIS IS GOING TO HELP OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES INCENTIVIZING OUR LANDLORDS TO ACCEPT THE 80% WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE INPUT FORM FROM FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU HIS BECAUSE HE HAS WORKED FOR SO LONG ON THIS ISSUE HIS INPUT HIS LEADERSHIP HERE WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. HAVING SPEAKER RENDON TAKE THIS ON IMMEDIATELY AS THE WELL AS AS WELL AS THE PRO TEM ATKINS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THIS WAS TOO SMALL TO LARGE TO ALLOW IT TO JUST GO THROUGH A PROCESS TO HELP OUR THREE LEADERS SAY THIS IS TOP PRIORITY WE'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING I'M REALLY PROUD OF THAT AND- GRATEFUL THAT I WAS ABLE TO JOIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU. IN SOME OF THESE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. MY QUESTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION IS THIS. I BOUNDS WITH SO MANY OTHER PROGRAMS THAT COME AND WHEN THEY GOAL WELL. WE'RE ALL HAPPY WHEN THEY DON'T IT IS OUR OFFICES TO RECEIVE THE CALLS IT IS OUR OFFICES IT IS OUR STAFF WHO THEN HAVE TO. TO TRY TO DO THE RESEARCH FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. WILL THE ADMINISTRATION BE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH PROVIDING. THEM PROVIDE CONTINUOUS INFORMATION TO THAT ARE LEGISLATIVE OFFICES TO ASSIST US IN TAKING CARE OF THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND NEEDS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. EARLIER IN REGARDS TO REPORTING THERE WILL BE THE MONTHLY REPORTING TO THE COMMITTEE- BUT I WILL TRY THIS QUESTION OVER TO WINNER AMY IN REGARDS TO DISTRICT OFFICES AND THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN. THE ADMINISTRATION AND DISTRICT OFFICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. YES GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I. I'M THE LEGISLATIVE DEPUTY AT A BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AND- SO I THAT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF INTERACTION- BOTH WITH NOT ONLY WITH LEADERSHIP STAFF BUT WITH DISTRICT. AND TO CAPITOL OFFICES WHEN PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS GENERALLY SPEAKING- AND ARE SUBJECT AREA AND- I WOULD SAY- OUT NGUYEN AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT WAS ENACTED WE OUT WORKED CLOSELY WITH A LEADERSHIP STAFF TO- SET UP A NUMBER OF TRAININGS- SEMINAR TYPE TRAININGS- WITH- BOTH CAPITAL AND DISTRICT OFFICE STAFF TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTOOD- BOTH THE ELEMENTS. OF THE LAW BUT ALSO ALL THE RESOURCES THAT THE STATE WAS MAKING AVAILABLE INFORMATIONAL RESOURCES AND HOW TO CONNECT WITH LEGAL AID IN THEIR COMMUNITIES- AND- OTHER OTHER- AT. WAYS TO. MAKE SURE THAT- COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT THEIR CONSTITUENTS WERE UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH THE- PROTECTIONS AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT AND- SO WE ENVISION SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR WITH THIS AS WELL- BUT OF COURSE WE HAVE. THE ADDED ELEMENT OF THE FINANCIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND- SO WE WILL BE- YOU KNOW PREPARING TO DO THAT AS WELL THE SAME KIND OF OUR REGION EDUCATION TO- CAPITAL AND DISTRICT OFFICES. AND WE REALLY SEE- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY DISTRICT OFFICES IS BEING WONDERFUL AMBASSADORS FOR THE PROGRAM- AND- YOU KNOW HELPING. TO SURFACE ISSUES AND CONCERNS- SO THAT WE GET- ALSO FEEDBACK THAT WE CAN INCORPORATE INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION. THANK. THANK YOU DOCTOR DOCTOR WHAT. YES THANK YOU I JUST HAVE I JUST HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION I YOU KNOW- I HEARD A NOTE 95% OF FOLKS LIVE IN URBAN AREAS- AREAS- THIRTY COUNTIES ARE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IN POPULATION THIRTY OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- I'M LOOKING AT HERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR PERMIT. THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER REQUIREMENTS IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS ONE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER. HOW DO YOU DO YOU ARE THERE OTHER PROGRAM INTO IMPLEMENTERS THAT WORK DIRECTLY. IS THIS ALL. BIG PROGRAM IMPLEMENTOR GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ALL THESE RELATIONSHIPS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OR ARE THERE OTHER PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS IT WILL BE WORKING AND OTHER KEY AND IN SMALLER COUNTIES. YES ABSOLUTELY SO THE WAY THAT ENVISIONED ABOUT THE THAT HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WOULD HAVE ONE CENTRAL CONTRACT WITH THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER AND THEN THAT PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER WOULD WORK WITH. NUMBER OF LOCAL DAY PARTNER THAT WOULD PROVIDE VARIOUS LEVELS OF SUPPORT AND CHANGE YOU INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES DIRECTLY- THE IDEA BEING THAT THE AD THE DECENTRALIZATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNICATION OUR REGION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. BUT THAT THE UNIFICATION OF THE APPLICATION MATERIAL INSIDE OF THE- THE CENTRAL PORTAL IS WHAT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT THAT THE CONTENT AND THAT THE PROGRAM RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE. THOUGH YES THERE WOULD BE THERE WOULD BE A NUMBER OF- I DIRECT DIRECT PROGRAM. PROVIDES PARTNERSHIP THAT WOULD BE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT THEN THEY WOULD LINK. UP TO THE CENTRAL IMPLEMENTOR. SO- LOGISTICALLY I OUT I DO I DON'T JUST AN IBM I'M NOT SURE TO BE TO I'M REALLY NOT A NEVER GONNA APOLOGIZE BEING PASS. IN MICE. OF MY CONSTITUENTS FOR THE FIVE COUNTIES ARE REPRESENTED LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND AND I AND I DO HAVE CONCERNS I JUST I JUST. WORRY THAT. WE'RE GONNA BE POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW NOT NOT SEE THAT- SEEM TO SEE THE SAME SUCCESS. BECAUSE EVERY TO WONDER ABOUT THE METRICS AND HOW THE METRICS WILL FLOW AND I HOPE THAT AS WE START GETTING INFORMATION BACK THAT IT WILL ALSO BE ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS SO WE CAN REALLY JUDGE THE SUCCESS. OF WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW HAVE INTERNET ACCESS WHAT WHAT THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU IS THAT'S NOT 95% IN EVERY COUNTY THAT'S MEANS IS THAT OFTEN SMALLER COUNTIES ARE RURAL COUNTIES ARE THE ONES THAT ARE JUST PROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED AND SO I HOPE THAT THE METRICS THEY WERE LOOKING AT. ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR. THE HIGH PERCENTAGE IN EVERY COUNTY AND NOT JUST THAT 95% NUMBER BECAUSE IF IT IS. WE LIVES AND I AND I AND THAT'S THAT'S JUST NOT FAIR. IT IF I MAY FOLLOW UP AND MAYBE I CAN EXPLAIN ONE OTHER THING THAT I THINK MAYBE WILL HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THAT CONCERN. AND THE WAY THAT IT'S BEEN VISION WITHIN THE- THAT THAT 5% IS THAT THERE WOULD BE A RESERVATION FOR EACH COUNTY. ON THAT UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SO AND- AS WE'RE LOOKING AT BOTH DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES AND THEN THE COMMUNICATION OUR REGION TECHNICAL. GEN IT WILL ALL BE TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND RESOURCES- THAT ALLOCATE THAT RESERVATION TABLE. UNTIL EACH JURISDICTION WILL WILL BE MONITORING FOR EXPENDITURE REYES. AND TARGETING SPENDING. TO THAT TO THAT POINT. OUR THERE HOLD BACK FRIEDMAN IS TO THE STATE ON THAT WERE THAT IS FOR THE IS THAT MONEY JUST GOING TO BE THAT ENTIRE AMOUNT GOING TO BE GOING OUT. IN OTHER WORDS IS THERE A MIDDLE IS THERE SORT OF A MIDDLE MAN ADMINISTRATIVE FEE. THAT MEANS THAT THE COUNTIES DON'T ESSENTIALLY GET ALL OF THAT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THURMOND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO BEING ABLE TO RENOUNCE THE PROGRAM- THAT- WE THINK THAT BY DOING IT MORE CENTRALLY LOCATED WE CAN FIND THE LAST. TIME BRITAIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOW FOR. SO IT COULD BE UP TO TEN PERCENT. THAT OF THAT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT DOESN'T REALLY GO TO THOSE COUNTIES IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THAT IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROGRAM BUT IT IS NOT WHAT WE ENVISION THE COST STRUCTURE WITH AND I THINK. BUT IF YOU'RE LARGER COUNTY WHICH YOU WOULD NEVER MIND I THINK YOU SEE MY POINT. IT'S A DIRECT ALLOCATION TO LARGER COUNTIES BUT- SMALLER COUNTIES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE A HARDER TIME. MAKE MAY LOSE. UP 210% OF HOPE DOESN'T HAPPEN BUT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU WHAT YOU SAID SO. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER FOR. I JUST A QUICK CLARIFICATION- TO THE POINT THAT- THAT SOME MEMBER WHAT MADE SO IS IT. JURISDICTIONS UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SO IS THAT WOULD BE COUNTIES AND CITIES OR IS IT JUST COUNTIES AND IT WOULD FLOW FROM THE COUNTY TO THE UP THE JURISDICTIONS UNDERNEATH GUY I'D MET MAYBE CAN PLEASE CLARIFY FOR ME. WHO WITH THE RESERVATION WOULD IT BE. I FOR EXAMPLE KERN COUNTY WOULD GO TO. THE CITY OF TEHACHAPI OR DIRECTLY WITH THE TAXI ATTACHED WE HAVE TO APPLY OR WOULD IT GO TO THE COUNTY IN THE COUNTY WOULD ALLOCATE THE MONEY TO THE CITY TAX BE. ALLOCATION QUESTION. SO FOR THE- THE JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE IN THE UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND- ACTION AND THERE'S NOT ACTUALLY A PHYSICAL TRANSFER OF MONEY TO THE COUNTY AT THAT THEIR THEIR RESERVATION BASED OFF OF THE POPULATION THAT THAT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT THEN THE APPLICATION BUT THEN THE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE INDIVIDUAL APPLICANTS. OKAY SO THE CITIES WITHIN THE CITIES- SMALL CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY WITH AND APPLY. FOR THAT THE PERSON THE GRANT THE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- FUNDING- ELIGIBLE FOR THE GRANTS. AND SO THE LANDLORD AND TENANT WOULD APPLY- AND THEN THEY'RE IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE AND THEN THEY MEET THAT CRITERIA THEN THERE PAYMENT WOULD BE ACTUALLY DEDUCTED FROM THE RESERVATION FOR THAT COUNTY. WITH THE COUNTY IN THE CITY SO THAT SO THE SPEECH WOULD PROMOTE THE GROUND WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION AND IN THE LOOP THE LANDLORDS AND TENANTS UNDERNEATH AND IN THE CITIES THEY WOULD THEN APPLY THAT THAT WOULD BE DEDUCTED FROM. THEIR A RESERVATION ABOUT. THAT'S CORRECT YES OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISS CAREER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M ALSO HERE TO GIVE TESTIMONY. BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE- COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AS WELL AS WELL AS LEADERSHIP IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR WORKING SO DILLON DILIGENTLY ON ON THIS VERY ISSUE. OUR STATE IS TAKING A MONUMENTAL STEP TODAY TO PROTECT FAMILIES FROM HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING INSTABILITY. AN IN THE FIGHT AGAINST OUR PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS BY EXTENDING THE UNIVERSAL OF ACTION MORATORIUM THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. CALIFORNIA'S COBIT OF ACTION PROTECTIONS ARE THE STRONGEST STATEWIDE ACROSS THE COUNTRY I WAS PROUD TO HAVE CO AUTHORED AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT LAST YEAR LEGISLATION THAT EXTENDED PROTECTIONS TO TENANTS AND HOMEOWNERS ON OF IT UNABLE TO MAKE THEIR RENT OR MORTGAGE OR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC. WITHOUT IT WE WOULD HAVE SEEN EVICTED FAMILIES BY THOUSANDS FORCED TO TURN TO SHELTERS THAT ARE ALREADY AT CAPACITY. CROWDING THE HOMES OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS SLEEPING IN CARS AND ON THE STREETS. AND PERHAPS EVEN BRING BACK THE MORTGAGE. FORECLOSURE CRISIS THAT WE SAW A FEW YEARS AGO. OUR NEW AGREEMENT IS NOT PERFECT BUT IT EXTENDS THE EVICTION MORATORIUM OF IN CALIFORNIA. UNTIL JUNE OF THIS YEAR PROTECTING TENANTS AND SMALL LANDLORDS FROM LOSING THEIR HOUSING INSTABILITY AS THE NATION CONTINUES. TO CONFRONT THIS PANDEMIC. IT IS ALL IT ALSO SEEKS TO MOVE FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S SHARE OF THE LATEST FEDERAL STIMULUS BILL. ENSURING THAT UP TO TWO POINT SIX BILLION AND RENTER AID IS ADMINISTERED WITH EQUITY. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACCOUNTABILITY. OUR CHARGE IN THIS BODY IS TO ENSURE THAT THESE FEDERAL DOLLARS WILL BE TARGETED TO THE MOST ADDRESS HOUSEHOLDS. AND WITH UNPAID BACK RENT AND WILL HELP TENANTS STAY AFLOAT DURING AND AFTER THE PANDEMIC. INCOME QUALIFIED TENANTS IN THERE LANDLORDS CAN CHOOSE TO RECEIVE DIRECT RENTAL ASSISTANCE IN EXCHANGE FOR GIVING PRIORAT PRIOR RENTAL DEBT. THE AFFECTION MORATORIUM AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF THESE FEDERAL FUNDS TO MEET. THE MOST AT RISK OUR OUR FIRST STEPS ARE NEXT UP STEPS MUST BE TO TACKLE THE HOUSING CRISIS. HOUSING COSTS AS WELL AS HOMELESSNESS AND THE HOUSES CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. THE PANDEMIC EXACERBATED THESE CRISIS WHICH WE KNOW ALREADY EXISTED. I DON'T WANT TO GLOSS OVER THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. AND I'M CAUTIOUS AND WORRIED THAT THIS PROGRAM IN THE TECHNOLOGY BEING USED IS ACTUALLY NOT AVAILABLE TO THE MOST NEEDIEST OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WITH THE LANGUAGE BARRIER. WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND TECHNOLOGY OR DOES NOT HAVE SOMEONE IN THEIR FAMILY TO GUIDE THEM HOW WILL YOU ACCESS. AN INTERNET PORTAL THAT YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACCESS SO MY QUESTION TODAY IS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE TRUSTED PARTNERS AND COMMUNITIES MOST WITH NEED. THE CAN ALSO HELP FACILITATE THIS PROCESS AND HOW THE TECHNOLOGY BEING USE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE LOOKING AROUND TO SEE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PIETERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH- THE HEART OF THIS ISSUE IS THAT WE WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS. MY PARENTS LOST THEIR HOME IN THE LAST HOUSING CRISIS AND I WOULDN'T WISH THAT EXPERIENCE ON MY WORST ENEMY. WHAT WHAT EXACTLY IS BEING DONE TO HELP HOMEOWNERS LIVING IN THEIR HOMES THEY'RE ALSO UNEMPLOYED AND UNABLE TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGES FORBEARANCES ARE GREAT BUT THEY STILL OWE THAT MONEY AT THE END OF THE LOAN WITH INTEREST ARE WE SETTING ASIDE ANY OF ANY FEDERAL FUNDS TO HELP WHEN THEM WITH THEIR MOUNTING DEBTS AND WHY WAS IT EXCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL AND ISN'T THE KEY WORD HERE EQUITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND THIRD STATE PROGRAM IS BASED ON THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS ON RENTAL ARREARS AND LANDLORDS- AS I STATED BEFORE THERE WAS A THERE'S AN EXTENSION OF. FORBEARANCE AND THE FEDERAL RELIEF SO I BELIEVE SO TOO MARCH- BUT THERE ARE AND THERE ARE ADDITIONAL EXTENSION OF. DEADLINES WITHIN STATE PROGRAM- REGARDING FOR PARENTS AS WELL AND- THE REQUESTS- IF THERE ARE ISSUES WITHIN IN THE CASE OF OUR CLASS TO BEING DENIED- THERE'S ADDITIONAL DAYS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MUST BE PROVIDED BY THOSE BANKS. BUT THE SPECIFIC- PROGRAM ITSELF IS FOR ADDRESSING RENTAL ARREARS AND YOU. S. FOR VENTURE. FOR SO THERE'S NO THERE'S NO FUNDS STATE- FOR AVAIL FOR HOMEOWNER TO HELP PAY DOWN THEIR DEBT. I'M THERE'S NOT IN THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM I WOULD TURN IT OVER TO LAND OR ANY HAVE ANY OTHER DETAILS. ON I DO- FOR HOMEOWNERS ONE PROGRAM THAT AND I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION HERE IS THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM THAT'S BEING ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY. AND SO THAT WAS THAT THOSE WE CAN POINT WHERE PROGRAM AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND- KALENJIN FAYE IS CURRENTLY RUNNING A- A- AS A FINANCIAL- SERVICE COUNSELING PROGRAM RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO HELP DISTRESSED MORTGAGE HOLDERS. AND THEY'RE GETTING READY TO LAUNCH THE SECOND PHASE OF THAT PROGRAM- IN YOU KNOW THE COMING IN THE COMING MONTHS. THAT WILL THEN PROVIDE MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE. TO HOMEOWNERS BOB. THANK YOU.
