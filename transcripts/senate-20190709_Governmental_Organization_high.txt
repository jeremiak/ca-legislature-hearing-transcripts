ONE THANK ORDER DODD MISTER CHAIR HIS MAIN MEMBERS. IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TUBS FIRE STARTED IN CALISTOGA IN IN UNDER FOUR HOURS WEB TWELVE MILES THROUGH SOME ACCOUNTING INTO THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA. AT THE TIME WE FELT THAT AS OF THIS WE HAD EXPERIENCE A ONCE IN A GENERATION TRAGEDY AND SINCE THEN WE'VE HAD THE THOMAS FIRE THE WOLSEY CAR WHICH IN CAMPFIRES. WHICH OF ALL SADLY PROVEN US WRONG WE NOW UNDERSTAND THESE CATS CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ARE PART OF THE NEW ABNORMAL. WE'RE STARTING TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM WE HAVE ON OUR HANDS. LAST YEAR IN SB NINE A ONE WE COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR FORESTS AND WHILE LANCE WHICH IS CRITICAL TO OUR CLICK BIGGER CLIMATE CHANGE PICTURE. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE OVER TWO MILLION HOMES ALREADY BUILT IN HIGH OR VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES AND THESE COMMUNITIES ARE IN IMMINENT DANGER. CURRENT BUILDING CODES REQUIRE NEW CONSTRUCTION TO UTILIZE MATERIALS LANDSCAPING AND DESIGNS THAT HELP PREVENT WELL WINDBLOWN EMBERS FROM IGNITING BUILDING TO SPREADING THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS HOWEVER THE VAST MAJORITY OF HOMES WE'RE THE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH WERE BUILT LONG BEFORE. THESE CODES WENT INTO PLACE. AB THIRTY EIGHT IS OUR ATTEMPT TO BEGIN ADDRESSING THE HUGE CHALLENGE OF PREPARING THIS OLDER BUILT ENVIRONMENT FOR THE FIRES OF THE NEW CLIMATE CHANGE HERE UP. IN THIS BILL WE ARE PROPOSING A TWO PRONGED APPROACH FIRST WE'RE PROPOSING A REBATE OR NO WE'RE LOW INTEREST REVOLVING LOAN FUND TO HELP PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES FOR HOMEOWNERS. TO RETROFIT HOMES IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES OWNS THE FUND WILL BE OPERATED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE WIDE COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY. SECONDLY REQUIRING HOMEOWNERS IN VERY HIGH HAZARD SEVERITIES OWES DISCLOSE WHICH FIRE HARDENING RETROFITS ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT HOME FOR WINDBLOWN EMBERS AND REVISED PROOF OF THIS IS OF A SUCCESSFUL DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION WHEN I'M HOME IS SOLD. WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ENSURE THE REQUIREMENTS DO NOT HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. OF PREVENTING HOMEOWNERS FROM SELLING THEIR HOMES I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE FOR WILL FIND THE BALANCE THAT CREATES FLEXIBILITY FOR WOULD BE HOME SELLERS. AND INCREASES THE INSPECTION AND RETROFIT RATES OF HOMES IN DANGER OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. CENTERS IS NOT A SILVER BULLET IT'S TAKEN AS GENERATIONS TO GET IN TO THE SITUATION IT WILL TAKE US YEARS TO GET OUT BUT I BELIEVE AB THIRTY EIGHT MOVES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HERE TESTIFIED SUPPORT IS LIZ FORSBERG WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IBM. PLEASE. MAYBE MY NAME IS LIZ FORSBERG LEMME SOCI TRACTOR POLICY FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE FIRE ADOPTED COMMUNITIES LEARNING NETWORK A NATIONAL GROUP WORKING TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE CAPACITY IN FIRE PRONE COMMUNITIES. AND WE ARE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTY EIGHT CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE THE WORST WILD WILD FIRES IN HISTORY SETTING NEW RECORDS FOR THE LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE. AND AS THE MAKE A FIRE TREND CONTINUES TO WORSEN IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE MAKE ALL COMMUNITIES AND HIGH FIRE HAZARD REGION'S MORE RESILIENT. WELL WE CAN'T STOP THIS PROGRAM PROBLEM OVERNIGHT THERE ARE TWO THINGS WE NEED TO INVEST IN IMMEDIATELY TO BETTER PROTECT PEOPLE AND NATURE IN THE FACE OF WILDFIRE. FORCED RESTORATION AND COMMITTEE FIRE PROTECTION. LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA MADE A ONE BILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT TO FOREST HEALTH AND FEELS REDUCTIONS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WE NEED TO COMPARE BOWL INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY PROTECTION TO ADOPT OUR HOMES TO DEAL WITH THE ESCALATING THREATS OF FIRE. THE FIRE HARDENED HOMES REVOLVING LOAN FUND CREATED IN AB THIRTY EIGHT WILL HELP US REACH THIS GOAL BY PROVIDING RESOURCES TO HOMEOWNERS TO RETROFIT HOMES FOR FIRE. IN ADDITION AB THIRTY EIGHT WILL ENSURE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY TO IMPROVE FIRE RESILIENCE. THE BILL WILL IDENTIFY WHICH COUNTIES NEED MORE RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO IMPROVE FIRE SAFETY. AND A DOCTOR COMMUNITIES TO DEAL WITH THE ESCALATING THREATS OF FIRE. LET'S STOP MAKING HISTORY AND START FIXING THE PROBLEM THROUGH BOLD MEASURES LIKE AB. THIRTY EIGHT WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS RHYME PARINI WAS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WANT TO THANK THE MEMBER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL WE SEE AB. THIRTY EIGHT AS A CRITICAL PIECE TO THE BROADER WILDFIRE PUZZLE AND HAPPY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. SO THAT THAT WOULD COME OUT A SHAREHOLDER FUNDS THEN RIGHT I'M JUST TEASING YOU. GO AHEAD NEXT DICK SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MARK FENSTER MAKER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT I WOULD SUPPORT THAT. AMENDMENT MISTER CHECK. THE FUTURE PLEASE ART RIGHT. I HAD TO GO THERE [inaudible] WHAT? OTHER -- THE WITNESSES OPPOSITION. I WE HAVE A CENTER ARE TO LET IT. AT THE END OF FOR OKAY. CENTER HUESO PLEASE. THANK YOU -- I JUST WANTED TO SAY. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. AND OTHERS A NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE WE CAN IGNORE. GIVEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE INTENSITY OF THESE FIRES AND I KNOW. IT IT'S GOING TO BRING A LITTLE BIT OF THE CONVENIENCE FOR A FEW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FILE THESE REPORTS. THIS UNFORTUNATELY NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN OUR STATE AND I HOPE. THE PEOPLE OF SEE THIS AS A VERY IMPORTANT NECESSARY MEASURE FOR EVERYBODY'S WEALTHY IN AND AND THE WELL BEING OF OF OUR STATE -- AND THIS IS GONNA BE CONSIDERED ONE OF A PART OF THE PACKAGE THAT WERE WERE VOTING ON AVENUE DEAL WITH. REDUCE IN -- THE AMOUNT OF FUEL IN IT OUT THERE IN TE STATE WE NEED EVERYBODY BE PART OF THIS WE NEED THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WE NEED. THE STATE WE NEED CAL FIRE WE NEED PROPERTY OWNERS WE NEED EVERYBODY INVOLVED. IN THIS MASSIVE -- STATEWIDE EFFORT IN THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILLS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE SONG. AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME SURE ONE MOVE THE STUFF THANK YOU CENTER ARE TO LET UP. YES THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN IT IS A EXTREMELY. IMPORTANT TO BILL AND WE'RE SO HAPPY I AM THAT THAT YOU BROUGHT BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND SHOW ON AND I SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD HAVE AND I'M SU MEAN YOU'RE WORKING IT OUT WERE YOU ALREADY HAVE AND THAT IS. YOU'VE GOT A BUYER YOU GOT A SELLER IN THE SELLER -- IS -- SEEKING TO SELL SURE HE WILL GO AHEAD AND ASK FOR AN INSPECTION OF SOME SORT SEE EXACTLY WHERE IT STANDS. AND THEN I WOULD IMAGINE THAT HE WOULD DISCLOSED TO THE BUYER. THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT -- RETROFITTED THE HOUSE DOES NOT HAVE THAT FIREPROOF ROOF. AND THE ADDICT IS NOT SECURE FROM MEMBERS COMING IN AND TO CONSEQUENTLY THE BUYER AT THAT POINT WOULD HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE. WALK INTO THE TRANSACTION AND SECURE THE HOME BUT THEN HIS -- ABLE TO GET A HOME LOAN A REVOLVING LOAN WHICH WOULD PAY FOR THE THE UPGRADES THAT ARE NEEDED. AND AT A LOW INTEREST RATE AND SO ON AND EVEN TO SOME POINT A REBATE WILL BE GIVEN. SO IT WOULD BE IT -- IT SHOULD BE A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC BUYER TO BE ABLE. TO TO RETROFIT IS HOME AND FOR FIRE SAFETY -- ENDED. AND I'M ASSUMING ALONG THE WAY IF A HOMEOWNER HAS NO -- THOUGHT OF SELLING THAT HE WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS -- REBATE AND LOAN AND AND JUST MAINTAIN HIS HOME FOR YEARS TO COME. SO BOTH SIDES I THINK -- THE CONSUMERS PROTECTED AND SCHUMER HAD RECEIVED INFORMATION. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO PREVENT A FIRE. IN HAVE PREVENTED FROM FIRE FROM SPREADING SO THAT WE WORK WITH THOSE ARE THE TWO OPPOSITION. THAT YOU I THINK YOU NAILED IT -- WE THAT IS THAT IS THE PATH WE HAVE TAKEN AND AS YOU SEE THERE WAS NO THERE WAS NO OPPOSITION. AS TO FIGHT TODAY AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH FOLKS I THINK THE DISCLOSURE IS CRITICAL I THINK -- AS A BUYER JADA NOW. AS A SELLER JADA NOW AS A HOMEOWNER JADA NOW THAT YOUR HOUSE ISN'T NECESSARILY FIRE SAFE AND SO -- WE'RE ALSO WORKING -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN HAS A BILL THAT WILL HELP IDENTIFY LOW COST RETROFITS -- I WAS LOW COST HIGH VALUE ON THE OTHER END THERE ARE SIMPLE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT YOUR HOME BUT IF YOU AS A HOMEOWNER DON'T KNOW THAT -- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PURSUE THAT AND THE END OF THE DAY IN THIS IS NOT TRYING TO BE PUNITIVE THIS ACTUALLY TRYING TO BE HELPFUL. BUT CHANGING BEHAVIORS HARD PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND I WOULD IMAGINE WE'RE GOING TO START AN OUTREACH PROGRAM PROMOTE THE FACT THAT. THIS IS AN AFFECT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE REMAINING WHO WOULD LIKE TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND OBTAIN HOSE LOANS. AND EVERYONE OF THOSE AFFECTED AREAS WOULD BE AWARE OF IT YEAH I THINK I BELIEVE OUR CAR FIRE OUR FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ARE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS -- THAT WORK LOCALLY -- TO HELP PEOPLE -- PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM FIRE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ENTHUSIASTIC AMBASSADORS FOR THIS PROGRAM AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT THAT THEY WILL GET THE WORD OUT. I THINK THE BILL WILL SAVE LIVES AND PROPERTY THANK YOU. OKAY ASSEMBLY WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM AS OF YET I JUST DO WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT FIRST OF ALL I REALLY LIKE YOUR BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. I THINK THIS IS THE NEW NOT NORMAL TYPE OF THE END OF THE ROAD THE REAL ESTATE ORGANIZATIONS ARE GONNA HAVE TO GET USED -- TO I BECAUSE I I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE START. PARDEE HOMES ONE OF THE THINGS AS WE WERE. WORKING ON HOW QUICKLY YOU FORGET THE BILL NUMBERS BUT YESTERDAY AN FIFTY FOUR THANK YOU THAT ONE FIFTY FOR THAT ONE YOU'LL BE WORKING ON ON THURSDAY -- YEAH WHEN WE ARE WORKING ON TRYING TO GET FUNDING AND ALKING TO THE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ABOUT. HARDENING OF HOMES -- THEY DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE INVESTMENT THERE THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT -- ON THE PAY OFF MORE AND I REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY IN THE WE WE AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THESE FIRES HAVE REALLY. DONE MOST OF THEIR DAMAGE IN TERMS OF HOME DESTRUCTION. SO I I I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED IT AND AND MAYBE -- MISS FORSBERG YOU'VE GOT SOME COMMENTS ON THIS THAT I THINK BY THE TIME THIS THING LEAVES HERE AS IT. GETS THE THE OTHER THREE THROUGH THIS PLACE INTO THE GOVERNOR BESIDE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP US. OR HELP THEM DETERMINE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO TO DO THIS AND WHAT A GOOD INVESTMENT IS TO HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT. SURE ABSOLUTELY JUST THE MORE THAT WE CAN INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO MAKE THEM FIRE ADOPTED IS REALLY CRITICAL. AND LIKE I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY WE PROVIDED RESOURCES TO HELP IMPROVE OUR FOREST NEED HELP TO PRINT PROVE OUR COMMUNITY CITY FIRE SCIENCE AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO. TO ENSURE THAT WE SEE SOME FUNDING FOR THESE ACTIVITIES THIS YEAR THE BETTER RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS WE GET A QUORUM A VOTE ON YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS KALRA. AB. FIVE SEVEN TWO THAT'S ITEM NUMBER. FIVE SHE SAID THAT. AND FOR THE RECORD LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION HAS REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU I THINK IT WAS SURE MEMBERS -- WITH THE FIRST LIKE TO ACCEPT SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS TO EXEMPT. CREDIT CARD PURCHASE THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR LESS THAN A JUST OPERATED DATES IN THE BILL. ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SEVENTY TWO THE CALIFORNIA DEFORESTATION FREE PROCUREMENT ACT WOULD REQUIRE STATE PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS WITH FOREST'S RISK COMMODITIES LIKE PALM OIL SOY CATTLE RUBBER APPALLED. ENTERED OVER NUDE ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO CERTIFY THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS ARE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION. TROPICAL DEFORESTATION RESPONSIBLE PERSON IF CAN PORTION OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE AS WELL AS WIDE RANGING IMPACT SOMEBODY DIVERSITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. AB FIVE SEVENTY TWO A SEARCH OUR CALIFORNIA VALUES AND EXTENDS ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP TO THE PROTECTION OF TROPICAL FORESTS SENDING A POWERFUL SIGNAL TO GLOBAL MARKETS THAT A LEGAL AND DESTRUCTIVE COMMODITY GERMAN DEFORESTATION WILL NO LONGER BE TOLERATED. SB FIVE SEVENTY TWO IS NOT DISSIMILAR TO WAYS TGS CERTIFIES CONTRACTORS ARE NOT ENGAGING CERTAIN BEHAVIORS AND THE BILL IS ACTUALLY MODELED AFTER AN EXISTING BECAME A BAN AGAINST CHILD LABOR. THE STATE HAS HAD IN PRACTICE FOR MANY YEARS. JUNE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENTS WHICH EXEMPTS PUBLIC WORKS BROOKS PROJECTS ON THE BILL AND SAID RESTRICTS THAT STATE -- FROM PUTTING FOR US WAS WHICH PROHIBITED UNDER THE LACEY ACT IN BIT SPECIFICATIONS REMOVED OPPOSITION FROM THE CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION. THERE'S A REASONABLE EXPECTATION ON STATE CONTRACTORS IN RETURN FOR THE BUSINESS THAT THAT THEY GET. TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS BUT THE PRODUCT CARE SOURCING DO NOT INCLUDE FORREST. FOREST RISK COMMODITIES ALSO IN ORDER TO PROMOTE GUIDANCE AND BEST PRACTICES AB BY SEVENTY TWO REQUIRES YES DEVELOP A DEPORTATION FREE CODE OF CONDUCT THAT INCLUDES A LIST OF FOR US WAS COMMODITIES. AND GUIDANCE TO CONTRACTORS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY FORCED RISK COMMODITIES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WITH ME PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY UP OUR JEFF CONANT UP ON BEHALF OF FRIENDS OF THE EARTH AN EXACT ON BEHALF OF SUCH COMPASSION LEGISLATION AND PEACE FOR ANIMALS. THANK YOU. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING A CLIMATE LEADER A LEADER IN INNOVATION AND A LEADER IN SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS. MY ORGANIZATION FRIENDS OF THE EARTH WAS FOUNDED IN CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND HAS BEEN A PROUD PART OF THIS LEGACY NOW 450- YEARS. AS MISTER KALRA SAID DEFORESTATION CAUSES UP 220% OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF THE EXTINCTION CRISIS AS WELL AS A KEY ELEMENT. BEHIND ABUSES OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES RIGHTS ACROSS THE TOP TROPICS THESE ARE THE PRIMARY REASONS WHY WE AT FRIENDS OF THE EARTH HAVE BEEN BEHIND AB FIVE SEVENTY TWO FROM DAY. ONE USING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC POWER TO FIGHT THE TROPICAL DEFORESTATION CRISIS JUST MAKES GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL SENSE. BUT THE BILL ALSO MAKES GOOD BUSINESS SENSE. IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED GLOBAL COMPANIES HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS TO ELIMINATE DEFORESTATION FROM THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS THIS INCLUDES COMPANIES THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE -- CARGILL UNILEVER NESTLE PEPSICO -- CRAFT ALL OF THE MAJOR CONSUMER BRAND COMPANIES HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO REMOVE DEFORESTATION FROM THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS BUT MANY OF THEM ARE HAVING TROUBLE IMPLEMENTING THESE COMMITMENTS. AND HUNDREDS MORE COMPANIES HAVE MADE NO SUCH COMMITMENTS TO MAKE BEST PRACTICE COMMON PRACTICE WE NEED TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO THAT. EVERY COMPANY POTENTIALLY LINKED TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION FACES THE SAME MARKET RULES THE SAME MARKET RISKS AND CAN EXPECT THE SAME MARKET REWARDS. AND HAT'S WHAT AB FIVE SEVENTY TWO WILL DO FOLLOWING SIMILAR POLICIES IN EUROPE AB FIVE SEVENTY TWO WILL BE A KEY STEP IN CREATING A LEGAL LANDSCAPE TO ENCOURAGE ROGUE COMPANIES. TO MEET THE SAME STANDARDS AS THE SUSTAINABILITY LEADERS. JUST LAST YEAR CALPERS BECAME THE FIRST PUBLIC PENSION FUND IN THE COUNTRY TO ADOPT A POLICY RECOGNIZING DEFORESTATION AS A MATERIAL RISK TO ITS INVESTMENTS. AND TODAY WE'VE GOT A LETTER THAT'S BEEN -- I THINK SHARED WITH ALL OF YOU -- FROM SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT FIRMS REPRESENTING FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT URGING YOU TO SUPPORT AB FIVE SEVENTY TWO AGAIN BECAUSE IT MAKES GOOD BUSINESS SENSE. SO LET'S CONTINUE TO MAKE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE LEADER A LEADER IN SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL INNOVATOR PLEASE SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA DEFORESTATION FREE PARKING AN ACT. THANK YOU. HI CHAIR MY NAME IS NICHOLAS SACKETT SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION ALSO REPRESENTING PIECE FOR ANIMALS THE OTHER PROD CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL. A LAST YEAR I WENT -- TO BORNEO AND SUMATRA AND SOLVE THE DEVASTATION. OF FIRSTHAND THIS TAKING PLACE TO THOSE TROPICAL FORESTS. ARE THESE FORCE ARE HOME TO THOUSANDS OF ENDANGERED PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES INCLUDING THE ANIMAL -- THAT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE CALL THEIR RING A TANK OR PERSON OF THE FOREST. WE SHARED NEARLY 97% OF THE SAME DNA WITH A RING AND HANGS. DURING INTENSE ARE ONE OF THE MOST CRITICALLY ENDANGERED OF THE GREAT APES DUE TO HABITAT LOSS FOR PALM OIL AND WOOD POLE PLANTATIONS. THIS IS A CRUCIAL TIME FOR RANTINGS THE RANKING CONSERVANCY BELIEVES THERE ONLY ABOUT FIFTY TO SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND LEFT. IN THE WILD ALMOST 80% OF BRING TING HABITAT HAS DISAPPEARED IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS DUE TO DEFORESTATION. LOCAL CONSERVATIONISTS ARE BEGGING FOR HELP FROM OUTSIDE THEIR BORDERS DEMAND FOR PALM OIL HAS PUSHED NATIONAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO UNSUSTAINABLE CULTIVATION. OF THESE COMMODITIES AND CONSERVATIONISTS BELIEVE IF LEFT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EVERY PLANT AND EVERY ANIMAL WILL BE BURNED AND KILLED ALL FOR SHORT TERM GAME. WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

FIVE NINE FOUR MORNING MR WARNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESENT FOR YOUR SIMPLY BILL. FIVE NINETY FOUR TERRIFIC. THE AIM OF THIS BILLS TACKLE TWO MAIN ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE -- TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND EXPERTISE IN THE USE OF A AYE IN STATE GOVERNMENT. AND TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL IMPACTS FOR WORK FOR SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A CHIEF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO EVALUATE THE USES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. AND STATE GOVERNMENT AND TO ADVISE THE DIRECTOR OF TECHNOLOGY ON INCORPORATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE STATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PLANS AND POLICIES. THE CHIEF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER WOULD IN ADDITION ADVISED CLIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IN ITS REVIEW OF WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO PREPARE AND TRAIN WORKERS POTENTIALLY DISPLACED BY A AYE. WE SEE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF A AYE BEING -- NOT ONLY DEVELOP IT ALSO UTILIZE OUR CITIES THAT ARE NOW STARTING TO UTILIZE A I ACTUALLY -- FOR INSTANCE IN THE COURTS TO PREVENT RACIAL BIAS FOR INSTANCE SO AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS WE THINK WE SHOULD BE MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION AND WE DO HAVE I DO HAVE -- MISTER NOW HERE -- IT SUPPORT. TO TEST THE MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AND SENATORS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TESTIFY MY NAME IS PEDRO NOMINAL FORMER MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY AND CURRENTLY SERVICES CHAIR OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. BUT OVER COMMISSION STUDY THE AREA OF A AYE SOMETIME AGO A NUMEROUS WITNESSES THREE DIFFERENT HEARINGS -- REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE AND STUDIES AND WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT UNFORTUNATELY. CALIFORNIA'S FALLING BEHIND MANY OTHER STATES. IN OTHER COUNTRIES WITH RESPECT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE -- OTHER STATES SUCH AS INDIANA AS AN EXAMPLE HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISH COMMISSIONS THAT ARE DOING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE RECOMMENDED WE SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. BECAUSE IT FOLLOWS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAD IN OUR REPORT AND THAT WS FOR SOMEONE. IN A HIGH LEVEL POSITION TO OCCUPY THE SPOT OF THE INTELLIGENCE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER AND THIS LEGISLATION DOES THAT -- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TO INSURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE. OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION PARTICULARLY ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CENTER ON JULY WOULD YOU LIKE% YES THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- DUE TO BE A THEY HAVE THE THE TECHNOLOGY OBVIOUSLY THE ROBOTICS THAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO NOW. BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE PORT OF LONG BEACH SAN PEDRO ALL THE OTHER PORTION OF COURSE. THERE THE LONGSHOREMEN ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTICS THAT ARE THERE IN THE FUTURE. AND I NOTICED THAT THE THAT THE THE COMMISSION IN THIS CASE WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND EDUCATION AND TRAINING -- TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYMENT IS A DAMAGE -- WITH THE FUTURE WITH INTELLIGENCE SHORT SEEMS LIKE WILL BE ABLE TO GET EVALUATION HOW THAT'S COMING TOGETHER. BECAUSE IT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE FUTURE WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO INCLUDE THE THE EMPLOYEES -- THEIR FAMILIES AND EVERYONE ELSE SO THEY CAN FEEL SECURE THAT THE JOBS WILL NOT BE LOSS BECAUSE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. BUT MARSHALL IN THE FUTURE THEY'LL BE INCOMPETENCE. AS ONE THROUGH EDUCATION AND I THINK THIS IS OUR FIRST STEP TO GIVE A SENSE OF CALM. TO WHAT -- THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THEY WILL BE INVOLVED THEY'LL HAVE A VOICE HAVE -- AN OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES AND SO WE CAN PROGRESS ALONG AND TAKE A RIDE FIREMAN AS WELL. SO THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- WHICH IS WE HAVE A QUORUM A VOTE ON THIS I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A SECOND ONE UP RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN A. B. A LOVE AND A LOT OF IT AMENDMENTS. TO HELLO MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS VERY NICE TO SEE YOU ALL -- FIRST OF ALL EXCEPT THE SUGGESTED COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS ADDING A FIVE YEAR SUNSET TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE. AB ELEVEN ELEVEN CREATES NEW OUT OFFICE OF OUTDOOR RECREATION FOR CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AB ELEVEN ELEVEN RECOGNIZES THAT THE OUTDOOR RECREATION ECONOMY IS TREMENDOUS IN OUR STATE. OVER NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLARS COMES INTO OUR ECONOMY BECAUSE OF OUTDOOR RECREATION SPENDING. AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AT A DIRECTLY CREATES MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND JOBS. A NEW OFFICE ABOUT A RECREATION WILL HELP CREATE NEW ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA. AND HARNESS THE CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION. IN THE FIELD IT WILL COLLABORATE WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND PROMOTE BUSINESS RELATED PROGRAMS TO THE OUTDOOR RECREATION INDUSTRY. PROGRAMS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT PROGRAM OR THE NEW EMPLOYMENT CREDIT PROGRAM IN ORDER TO RETAIN AND GROW OUR OUTDOOR RECREATION BUSINESS. AND OFFICE ABOUT A RECREATIONAL A BROADER THAN ONE TYPE OF LAND MANAGER. IT WILL FOSTER STATEWIDE DISCUSSION OF WHAT OUR PRIORITIES IN PLAN SHOULD BE FOR SUPPORTING AND GROWING. THE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR OUTDOOR RECREATION. ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA. FOURTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE SIMILAR OFFICES AND EXECUTIVE LEVEL POSITIONS FOCUSED ON THEIR STATE'S OUTDOOR RECREATION SECTORS. IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS WISCONSIN ESTABLISHED ONE NOW I'VE HAD PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT SAY WHY DO WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE THIS WE GOT PEOPLE ALL OVER GROUP WITH PARK EVERY DAY. AND THAT'S TRUE BUT THE SAME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT RIGHT NEXT DOOR AND SAN GABRIELTHEY CAN GO ON HOW TO A WATERFALL. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY CAN GO UP TO WHITE WATER RAFT IN PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF TOURISM IN TAURUS DOLLARS. I'VE HAD MEMBERS FROM RURAL COUNTIES -- IN THE ASSEMBLY TELL ME THAT THIS WOULD HELP BRING THOSE TOURISTS TO COME FROM OUT OF STATE WHO MAYBE HAVE HEARD OF YELLOWSTONE BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THE STANISLAUS. INTO THEIR AREAS. THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE A LOT OF GOALS ABOUT GETTING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY MEMBERS OUT INTO THE OUTDOORS BUT WE HAVE NO REAL INTER AGENCY COORDINATION. OF HOW TO DO THAT AND HOW TO WORK WITH OUR PRIVATE BUSINESS SECTORS IN ORDER TO FOSTER THAT KIND OF COOPERATION TO HELP BUILD. THE LOVE OF THE OUTDOORS FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN THE INNER CITY. AND TO BRING THEM INTO PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE LESS ACCESSIBLE. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN SEVEN ELEVEN IS SCOTT EMMONS FROM ARI I AND AND SOMEBODY ELSE. THE SETTLEMENT IN THERE DONE THAT. PLEASE FIRST WITNESS. HI GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SCOTT AMMONS I'M THE ARI I OUTDOOR PROGRAMS MANAGER FOR OUR AREA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH MEANS I RUN OUR LOCAL GUIDE SERVICE -- I ALSO DO COMMUNITY PROGRAMS AND RUN OUR GIVING PROGRAMS AND ARE A STRONGLY SUPPORTS AB. ELEVEN ELEVEN SORRY IT HAS. BEEN A CALIFORNIA BASED BUSINESS NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WE HAVE TWENTY EIGHT STORES TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND ALMOST FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIA'S AS MEMBERS OF OUR COOP. SO ARE AS A COOPERATIVE THAT IS MANAGED FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS COMMUNITY.ONE THING MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS WE GIVE OVER 70% OF OUR PROFITS BACK. TO THE COMMUNITY IN THE FORM OF GRANTS TO LOCAL NGOS MEMBERS AND STAFF -- RECENTLY WE'VE GIVEN ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO DOZENS OF NON PROFITS IN THE STATE. RANGES FROM THINGS LIKE FRIENDS OF THE LA RIVER AND TO RESURGENT. SET UP INTO THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF TIME OUTDOORS. SO -- AS SHE WAS SAYING CALPERS UNDER RECREATION ECONOMY IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY AND SUPPORTS ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS. AND THIS OFFICE ABOUT THE RECREATION WILL BE ABLE TO HOLISTICALLY WORK AND GROWING THE ENTIRE RECREATION SECTOR BY INCREASING PARTICIPATION. ADVOCATING FOR INVESTMENT AND REMOVING BARRIERS TO ACCESS -- IT WOULD IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF EVERYONE IN EVERY COMMUNITY IN THE STATE. SO KIDS NOWADAYS SPEND ALMOST SEVEN HOURS A DAY LOOKING AT SCREENS AND ADULTS IT'S EVEN WORSE IT'S ELEVEN HOURS A DAY -- MEANWHILE HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE GOING UP. SO PROMOTING OUTDOOR RECREATION IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY BUT IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. HI IT WOULD ALSO HELP PROMOTE BUSINESS IN RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. THIS OFFICE WOULD HELP THE AGENCIES. THEY CARE ABOUT THE OUTDOORS WORK BETTER TOGETHER FROM HEALTH CARE AGENCIES TO EDUCATION TO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TOURISM AND ENVIRONMENTAL FAIRS. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF TOWN DOORS LIKE THE FOURTEEN OTHER STATE SET UP OFFICES HE WOULD MAKE SURE THESE AGENCIES ARE COORDINATED IN GETTING THE MAXIMUM SOCIAL. AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING AB ELEVEN ELEVEN AND THINGS TO ASSEMBLY ONE FRIEDMAN FOR LEADING IT. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING HI MY NAME IS MADELINE I IN THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA OUTDOOR RECREATION PARTNERSHIP -- WE REPRESENT MEMBERS IN THE STATES THAT ARE OUTDOOR RECREATION GEAR MANUFACTURES -- IS IT ON THE REST ARE SORRY I'LL START AGAIN MY NAME'S MATT LION -- CAIRMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA TO RECREATION PARTNERSHIP -- WE REPRESENT A MEMBERS IN THE STATES THAT ARE OUT TO RECREATION GEAR MANUFACTURES SPECIALTY RETAILERS. AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC AREAS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OF OUTDOOR RECREATION -- I'M ALSO THE FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF HIGH TO PACK A GEAR MANUFACTURER BASED IN OAKLAND -- EMPLOYING TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE IN THE AREA AND DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE U. S. -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR SEVERAL YEARS ON THIS BILL -- AND EXPLOITATIVE WELL WE REALLY APPRECIATE ITS ABILITY TO BRING FORWARD IN A SINGULAR POINT -- THEY OUT TO RECREATION SPACE WHICH ENCOMPASSES MANY DIFFERENT THINGS -- BOTH -- CAPITAL ASSETS PARTICIPATION IN OUTDOOR RECREATION -- AND EMPLOYMENT IN RURAL AREAS -- SO WE STRONGLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN FAVOR THIS BILL. THIS IS IN SUPPORT. MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRING GARCIA ON BEHALF OF THE FRONT OF THE LA RIVER THE COMMITTEE NATURE CONNECTION LOS ANGELES A WITH A TRANSFER AS NATURE FOR ALL. CONSIDERED RELEASED IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING KATIE HAWKINS FROM THE OUTDOOR ALLIANCE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MARK FENCER MAKER FOR THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY OPEN SPACE THIRTY IN SUPPORT. MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS TH	C HOUSTON REPRESENT EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT -- COUNTY OF CINEMA REGIONAL PARKS AND WATERSHED CONSERVATION SUPPORT AT THE READY ON SUPPORT. SURE MEMBERS JERRY DOES MEN OF HAVE A RECREATIONAL BOATERS A CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THE OBJECTIVES TO PROMOTE OUTDOOR RECREATION OUR SUPPORT IS A SOMEWHAT CONDITIONAL. OF FIRST IS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU DEVELOP A OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR THIS THAT IT'S NOT AT THE REDIRECTION OF EXISTING. OF REVENUES PAID BY VOTERS INTO DIVISION VOTING -- WATERWAYS AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND WE LIKE TO FILL IN SOME IN SUPPORT ALSO ENCOURAGE A NAMING THE DIVISION OF BOATING AND WATERWAYS AS AN ADVISER COMMITTEE MEMBER AS IT WAS FOR SO THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARK SMITH ON BEHALF OF TWO COALITIONS TODAY MY COMMENTS ARE ACTUALLY Là MORE EXTENSIVE SHOT COME UP AND SIT OR IS IT OKAY TO DO IN HERE. AT YOUR PLEASURE. OF THE CURRENT WELL. SO WOULD LIKE TO START BY CLEAR FINE -- THAT THE TWO COALITIONS I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF BOTH SUPPORT TE BILL -- AND ARE PLEASED TO SEE THIS MOVING FORWARD -- BUT WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR SOME SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS -- IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE NOTED THAT THE BILL PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THROUGH AN ADVISORY PANEL WITH THE OFFICE. BUT THE BILL'S ALSO QUITE PRESCRIPTIVE IN TERMS OF THE STATE AGENCY PARTICIPATION THAT IT REQUIRES INCLUDING EDUCATION -- CITY OF W. AND PARKS WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR THE INCLUSION OF TWO ADDITIONAL STATE ENTITIES AND WE FEEL LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NAME THOSE IN THE BILL -- AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE BROADER STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY HAS ITS OPPORTUNITIES TO GAUGE AS WELL FIRST IS THE CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. AS YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE HUNTING IN ANGLING IS A HUGE FORM OF OUTDOOR RECREATION IN THE STATE GENERATES. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE ECONOMY EVERY YEAR AND IS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF FUNDING REVENUE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION IS A GUBERNATORIAL HE APPOINTED COMMISSION THAT IS DISTINCT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND HAS SOLE JURISDICTION. OVER SETTING REGULATIONS SEASONS LIMITS EVERYTHING AS IT PERTAINS TO HUNTING AND FISHING AND SO WE THINK THAT THEIR PARTICIPATION IS IMPORTANT. SECOND -- WE'D LIKE TO ASK FOR THE INCLUSION OF THE DIVISION OF BOATING AND WATERWAYS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE THAT UNTIL RECENTLY THIS WAS A STANDALONE DEPARTMENT. IT HAS BEEN ROLLED UNDERNEATH PARKS BUT IT STILL HAS A SIGNIFICANT PORTFOLIO OF RESPONSIBILITY INCLUDING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE TALKED ABOUT. IN THE FINDINGS OF THE BILL LIKE BEACH EROSION AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND WATER WAYS. OUTDOOR RECREATION ON CALIFORNIA'S WATER WAYS IS A BIG COMPONENT OF OUTDOOR RECREATION WE ARE SECOND ONLY TO FLORIDA. IN THE NUMBER OF BOATS THAT ARE LICENSED IN THE FIFTY STATES AND WE THINK THAT BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARKS IT'S HUGE BREATH -- HAVING ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM PARKS IN GENERAL IS NOT ENOUGH AND THAT WE WOULD SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED A PERSON REPRESENTATIVE FROM DIVISION OF BOATING AND WATERWAYS BE INCLUDED AS WELL -- AGAIN WE WE DO SUPPORT IN CONCEPT BUT WE WOULD REALLY LIKE AN AMENDMENT TO SEE THOSE TWO STATE ENTITIES ADDED. TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OFFICE ABOUT TO RECREATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY BODY ELSE -- IN OPPOSITION. SEEING THAT ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE. WELL HAVING GONE HOPELESSLY FLY FISHING LAST YEAR WITH THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND PLANNING TO DO IT AGAIN. IN A MONTH I SEE THE WISDOM OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND IF THE CHAIR IS SUPPORTIVE OF THAT I'M CERTAINLY FIND WITH. ADDING THAT. ADDING SPECIFICALLY THE FISSION GAME -- MEMBER AND MAKING SURE THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDE ALL OF THE MAJOR STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE VOTING -- REPRESENTATIVE BUT IT'S UP TO THE CHAIR. IF YOU'RE FOR THAT IT TAKES WAY ALL OPPOSITION ANY OBJECTION. OUR WITH THE WITH FISHING GAMES ARE WILL DO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME WE DON'T HAVE ANY -- DIFFERENT SORT OF WE DON'T SAY THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE AN A QUESTION REPRESENTATIVE FOR A BOAT REPRESENTATIVE THAT'S KIND OF TO BE DETERMINED BUT WE'RE FINE WITH YOU KNOW CERTAINLY HAVING THEM INCLUDED BUT IN TERMS OF A MEMBER I THINK HAVING A FISHING GAME -- DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE ON THE AS IN A PUBLIC AGENCY MAKE UP MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE OUR RESPECTIVE. STAFFS THAT THING AND WE WORKED OUT I GUESS I'D I WOULD POINT OUT THAT. A QUESTION REPRESENTS REPRESENTATIVE IS IS IN THE STATE AGENCY AS I JUST THINK FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS TO WEIGH IN -- I'M FIGHTING TAKING THAT -- BUT IT IS A STATE AGENCY ONE OF THE REASONS WE COMPROMISED ON THAT WAS. THE BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF BOATING AND WATERWAYS IS UNDER THE OPS US THIS IS -- PARKS AND THE PARKS DEPARTMENT. SO CENTER YEAH I'M JUST SIMPLY IF IT IF IT WORKS IF IT HELPS THE BILL FOR MAKES IT BETTER THAN -- I'M ALL FOR IT AS WELL. CAN I WOULD -- WHOEVER QUIRK WITH. OKAY WE'RE GONNA STOP RIGHT HERE.
