00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:08.414
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE PROVIDED

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.848
TO THE STUDENTS AND THE NUMBER

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:11.550
OF STUDENTS UTILIZING THEM SO

00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:12.818
THERE IS A BROAD RANGE OF

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:15.054
POTENTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.722
THOSE PROVISIONS THAT ARE.

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:19.658
MANDATED IN A BILL THANK YOU IS

00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:21.594
SICK IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WITH

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.529
THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE IF

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:26.232
THE DECISION IS MADE TO RETAIN

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:27.600
THAT TRIAL THAT THAT AT THE

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:28.834
GRADE LEVEL WHATEVER LEVEL OF

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:32.471
MOVIE THEY STILL GET THE MONEY

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:36.609
FOR THE. ATTENDANCE OF THE

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:37.743
CHILD IN THE COMING YEAR. WE

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:38.911
THAT A IF THERE ARE MORE

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:40.012
STUDENTS. BUT LET'S SAY WE

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:42.715
DON'T GRAD. X. NUMBER WE HAVE

00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:44.917
X. MINUS WHATEVER THAT THE

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:45.684
VARIABLE IS WOULDN'T THEY

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:47.052
RECEIVE THAT MONEY DURING THE

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:49.588
SCHOOL YEAR TO PAY FOR THAT.

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:50.990
THAT THE SERVICES. YOU'RE IN

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:52.157
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S GOING TO

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:54.460
COST MAYBE A SCHOOL DISTRICT A

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:55.461
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:59.164
TO MAKE THAT EVALUATION. AND

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:04.203
CHANGE THE REGULATIONS. SENATOR

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.004
I THINK THE COST TO BE

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.305
DEPENDENT ON AGAIN THE NUMBER

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:07.973
OF STUDENTS THAT THIS WOULD

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.675
IMPACT WHICH IS WHICH IS THAT.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.577
AND THEN THE LEVEL OF DETENTION

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:14.113
OF SERVICES OR- EDUCATIONAL

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:15.381
ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:17.916
PROVIDED TO THAT STUDENT. OR

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:19.084
GROUP OF STUDENTS WHICH WOULD

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:20.786
PROBABLY VERY AND BE TAILORED

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:24.056
TO THAT STUDENT- WHICH COULD. I

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:25.658
THINK THE BILLS DESCRIBES IT AS

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:28.294
NO UP COULD COULD INCLUDE-

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.296
ADDITIONAL SUMMER CLASSES OF

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:33.799
CREDIT. BY JUST A HOST OF

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:37.736
DIFFERENT- OPPORTUNITIES- AND

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:39.772
BECAUSE THE BILL REQUIRES THOSE.

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:41.006
OUR CONCERN IS WITH THE

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.574
POTENTIAL MANDATE ON ELLIE ACE

00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:44.276
IRRESPECTIVE OF YOU KNOW THE

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:47.379
FUNDING THAT IS PROVIDED TO

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:49.214
LIAISE WHETHER IT BE STATE OR

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.450
FEDERAL MONIES AT THE FACT THAT

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:53.819
WE'RE MANDATING IT. IN THIS IN

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:55.387
THIS MEASURE WOULD NOT PRECLUDE

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:56.989
PRECLUDE LEDS FROM FILING A

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.991
MANDATE FOR REIMBURSEMENT WITH

00:15:59.058 --> 00:15:59.892
THE COMMISSION ON STATE

00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:03.195
MANDATES WOOL OKAY FINANCE THAT

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:04.897
SAYS THEY'RE MANDATING IT BUT

00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:06.899
IF WE DID NOTHING WE KNOW THAT

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:08.734
AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS FIFTEEN

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:11.804
MONTHS IN DISTANT LEARNING THAT

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.807
SOME MANY IT'S WELL PUBLICIZED

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:16.075
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOT

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:17.576
LIVING IN A VACUUM THAT THE

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.378
THESE KIDS ARE NOT SHOWING UP

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:21.313
OR THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT GETTING.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.349
GETTING THERE YOU MEAN YOU MUST

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:24.416
HAVE SEEN THIS COMING THAT

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.051
THERE COULD BE THIS DECISION

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:27.453
NOW THAT IT'S JUNE AND THE

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.921

SOMETHING NEEDED TO BE DONE AND

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:32.591
THAT AND THAT THESE EACH AND

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:33.525
EVERYONE OF THE SCHOOL

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:36.261
DISTRICTS HAD SOME IDEA OF WHO

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:37.963
THE NO SHOWS ON THE ON IT WITH

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.698
THE KIDS THIS SHOULDN'T BE A

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:43.302
SURPRISE- ON THE IMPACT THAT

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:44.837
TAPPING IT THIS IS A LIFE LINE

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:47.005
NIGHT IS I READ IT. TO SAY OKAY

00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:48.173
HERE'S A PROCEDURE TO GO

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.110
THROUGHTHE WITH THE GRADES AND

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:53.379
BE VERY FLEXIBLE ABOUT THE

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:55.347
RETENTION AND THEN DO WHAT'S IN

00:16:55.414 --> 00:16:56.915
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD

00:16:56.982 --> 00:17:02.488
I MEAN IF. WE DIDN'T DO

00:17:02.554 --> 00:17:03.088
ANYTHING THEY WOULD JUST. THEY

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:04.356
HAVE TO DO SOME ANYWAY BUT THE

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:05.157
SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD HAVE TO

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:06.158
MAKE THIS IS WHETHER THE KITTEN.

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:08.727
GRADE OR PROMOTE THEM FIFTH. WE

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:10.396
WOULDN'T BE DIZZY. WHEN HE SAID

BECAUSE THEY HAD THEY WOULD

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:16.602
HAVE DONE SOMETHING WITH IF WE

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:18.937

IT. THEY COULD HAVE DONE. IT'S

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:29.548
IMPOSSIBLE THING THAT THEY

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:30.649

DISTRICTS BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.227
POLICY THAT IF YOU ASK THEM

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.729
LOOK MY CHILD WAS NEVER ON ZOOM

00:19:57.796 --> 00:19:58.830

RUNNING AROUND THE HOUSE I KNOW

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.833
THAT THEY LOST A FULL YEAR OF

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.068
INSTRUCTION THE SCHOOL WILL

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:22.588
SHOULD BE HAPPENING. WE SHOULD

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:23.555
HAVE TO MANDATE THESE

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:24.523
CONVERSATIONS UNFORTUNATELY

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.657

THAT CONVERSATION MAYBE IN THE

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:56.788
BEGINNING HERE WE MAY HAVE SOME

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.323
ADJUSTMENT PERIOD BUT IT'S A

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.424
CONVERSATION THAT HAS TO

00:20:59.491 --> 00:21:00.525
HAPPEN. AND BY THE WAY WE'RE

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:01.693
WORKING IN THE SCHOOL YEAR AND

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.594
THEIR SENIORS WERE NOT

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:04.296
GRADUATING AND DON'T REALIZE

00:21:04.363 --> 00:21:05.263
THAT THEY COULD STAY AN EXTRA

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.633
YEAR. FOR PORTIONS OF THE YEAR

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:08.700
IN ORDER TO GET THEIR HIGH

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:09.935
SCHOOL DIPLOMA THE DIFFERENCE

00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:10.969
BETWEEN GRADUATE WITH A HIGH

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:12.437
SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND FINISHING A

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:14.773
G. E. D. IS EXTREME. AND SO

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.174
THESE ARE THINGS THAT YES WE

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:17.075
SHOULD HAVE DONE IT WAY BACK IN

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:18.076
FEBRUARY HAVE AN URGENCY

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:19.244
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:20.545
GET IT THROUGH BUT WE NEED TO

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:22.447
PROVIDE. OPPORTUNITIES AND

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:23.782
CHOICES FOR PARENTS AND

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:25.951
STUDENTS- TO HAVE HAVE THAT

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:27.653
OPPORTUNITY. SO THERE'S NOTHING

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:29.588
IN YOUR BILL THAT. YOUR BILL IS

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:32.157
SILENT TOO. IF THE SCHOOLS ON

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.725
BREAK AND THE TEACHERS ON

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:41.633
BREAK- M. INNER. YOU CAN.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.234
TEACHER BECOME. TO COME BACK.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.236
DOWN THIS KIND. OR I I'M I'M IN.

00:21:44.302 --> 00:21:45.137
TO ARE GONNA WANT TO HAVE KIND.

00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:46.738
SO THERE. BUT THERE'S GOING TO

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:48.073
BE OUTLYING SITUATIONS WHERE

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.175
TEACHERS I'M ON BREAK I'M NOT

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:53.278
AVAILABLE. HOW TO USE. IT A

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:54.579
BILL I THINK IS SILENT AS I

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:55.781
TRACK IT IS THE ONLY PROBABLY

00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:57.182
BE CONDITIONAL COLLECTIVE

00:21:57.249 --> 00:21:58.083
BARGAINING AND- I ASSUME AT THE

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.051
LOCAL LEVEL HOWEVER THE

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:00.619
CONVERSATION HAS TO TAKE PLACE

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:01.653
RIGHT. AND THAT'S THE POINT

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.088
WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH IN A LOT

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:03.889
OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE

00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:05.724
STARTED. TALKING ABOUT THIS KID

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:06.491
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE BILL IS

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:07.893
COMING IN AND WE THINK THAT'S A

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:09.728
POSITIVE THING. EVEN IF THE

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:11.430
CONVERSATION TAKES PLACE RIGHT

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:13.598
WHEN- SCHOOL STARTS AGAIN. WITH

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:14.433
THAT TEACHER RIGHT WHEN THEY

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:15.767
COME BACK A FEW WEEKS BEFORE

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:16.835
SCHOOL THERE'S NOTHING TO

00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:19.004
PREVENT. THAT THAT TEACHER. THE

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:20.372
ADMINISTRATOR AT THE PARENT

00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:22.441
DECIDING THE SCHOOL THE- CHILD

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:23.642

SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEING. EIGHTY

00:22:30.148 --> 00:22:31.283

THIS MAY BE SURPRISING TO

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:46.865
SEVERAL PEOPLE HERE BUT I WAS

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:49.201

THIRD GRADE I WAS THE I. I WAS

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.177
ALWAYS BEHIND- WE I THINK IT'S

00:22:59.244 --> 00:23:01.480
INCUMBENT UPON US AS LEADERS IN

00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:03.548
CALIFORNIA THAT OUR VALUE

00:23:03.615 --> 00:23:05.951
EDUCATION. FOR SOME REASON

00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:08.053
THERE'S BECOME A STIGMA. AND

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.489
PARENTS EGOS GET IN THOUGH AND

00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:11.757
I'VE HAD THE SAME I'VE HAD THIS

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:12.457
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:13.892
FRIENDS OF MINE THAT HAVE

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:14.459
REFUSED TO HOLD THEIR KIDS

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:18.697
BACK- BECAUSE THEY TOOK IT AS A

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:23.435
STIGMA OR A- THEY FAILED OR

00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:24.402
SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE U. TWO

00:23:24.469 --> 00:23:26.371
PARENTS DON'T FAIL. WHEN THEIR

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:27.839
KIDS NEED TO BE HELD BACK THE

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:29.374
KIDS JUST NOT READY TO GO TO

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:33.011
MOVE ON AND THAT HAPPENS- IN

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:33.545
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT MALCOLM

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:35.413
GLADWELL WROTE A BOOK CALLED

SUCCESS. IN PART ONE OF THE

00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:41.553
STUDIES IN THAT BOOK IS HE

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.356
LOOKED AT WHAT MADE- IS CERTAIN

00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:47.325
CANADIAN YOUTH HOCKEY TEAMS

00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:49.127
MORE SUCCESSFUL OR PLAYERS MORE

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:51.096
SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHER. YOUTH

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:53.131
HOCKEY PLAYERS AND WHAT HE

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:54.800
FOUND OUT WAS THE KIDS THAT WE

00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:56.535
WENT INTO KINDERGARTEN AT A

00:23:56.601 --> 00:24:01.106
LATER AGE. ACTUALLY ARE THE-ONES THAT EXCELLED AND BECAME

00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:05.010
THE BETTER PLAYERS. WHICH WHEN

00:24:05.076 --> 00:24:05.710
YOU LOOK AT LIKE. YOU DON'T

00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:07.012
THINK OF THIS BUT SOON AS IT'S

00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:08.213
OUT IN THE BOOK IT MAKES

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.948
PERFECT SENSE THESE KIDS ARE

00:24:10.015 --> 00:24:10.916
SIX MONTHS TO TWELVE MONTHS

00:24:10.982 --> 00:24:13.218
YEARS- TWELVE MONTHS OLDER THAN

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:14.219
THE OTHER KIDS OF COURSE ARE

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:16.321
GOING TO EXCEL. AND DO BETTER

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:19.424
SO- YOU KNOW MAYBE. WE NEED TO

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:21.092
BE ALSO IN ADDITION TO THIS AND

00:24:21.159 --> 00:24:22.928

POLICY ISSUES NEXT YEAR. WITH

00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:29.901
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. HAVE

00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:31.369
THAT ATTITUDE THAT I THINK WE

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:32.437
NEED TO START DRESSING AND

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:34.105
REMOVING THE STIGMA OF CHILDREN

00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:35.307
BEING HELD BACK. SOMETIMES

00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:36.474

AT IT'S A HIGH LEVEL ESTIMATE

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.055
BASED ON EACH ELLIE A

00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:59.057
PARTICIPATING IN EACH OF THE

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:00.558
REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:02.460
STARTING FROM A LOW RANGE FOR

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:04.462
AN ALLEY A. FOR THE FIRST

00:26:04.529 --> 00:26:06.631
PORTION OF THE BILL REGARDING-

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:10.936
THE RETENTION ISSUE OF A LOW

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:11.503
FIVE HUNDRED. SMALLEY ELLIE

00:26:11.569 --> 00:26:12.871
EIGHT TO. FIVE THOUSAND

00:26:12.938 --> 00:26:16.875
DOLLARS- FOR A LARGER LED AND

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:19.878
THE SAME THING FOR THE SECOND

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:21.479
PART OF THE BILL REGARDING A

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:22.847
GREAT CHANGES IN PROVIDING

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:25.050
EXPANDED ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:27.085
TO STUDENTS IT'S AT THE ALLEY A

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:31.489
LEVEL- RANGING FROM A LOW OF

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:34.326
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS- TWO FIVE

00:26:34.392 --> 00:26:35.160
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. I

00:26:35.226 --> 00:26:36.328
DON'T HAVE MORE GRANULARITY

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:40.498
THAN THAT THEN IT'S BASED ON-

00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:42.067
BATTLE AND FOR THE SECOND WHERE

00:26:42.133 --> 00:26:43.201
THERE IS A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:45.904
COSTS FROM FIVE THOUSAND TO

00:26:45.971 --> 00:26:46.805
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR VERY

00:26:46.871 --> 00:26:51.676
LARGE L. EA- IT IS IT HAS BEEN

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:53.278
REDUCED FOR NOT ALL LEDS

00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:55.013
BECAUSE NOT ALL AT LEAST SERVE

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.847
NINE THREE TWELFTH GRADERS SO

00:26:55.914 --> 00:26:57.182
THAT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO ABOUT

00:26:57.248 --> 00:26:59.050
ONE THIRD OF. THE TOTAL NUMBER

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:01.152
OF LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES.

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:02.921
SO IT'S BASED ON THE SIZE OF

00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:06.491
THE ALLEY A NOT NECESSARILY THE

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:07.926
NUMBER OF STUDENTS. AND I WOULD

00:27:07.993 --> 00:27:11.062
ADD IT. YOU KNOW IT'S AN

00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:12.697
ESTIMATED RANGE AND IT IS

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:14.132
UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME HOW MANY

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:16.501
STUDENTS YOU KNOW WOULD BE

00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:20.138
UTILIZING- ADDITIONAL SERVICES

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:20.739
AND WHAT THOSE SERVICES WOULD

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:23.174
BE. DEPENDENT ON THE L. OKAY

00:27:23.241 --> 00:27:25.343
AND THEN FOR CLARIFICATION.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.881
IT'S FOR. IS IT I READ IT FOUR

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:31.716
HI FOLKS KIDS ARE IN HIGH

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:33.918
SCHOOL BUT IT'S FOR EVERY

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:34.719
STUDENT THAT HAPPEN TO BE

00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:38.490
ENROLLED. IN CLASS DURING THE

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:41.359
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SCHOOL YEAR.

FUNNELED INTO THE OFFICE AND

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.336

I WAS ASKING YOU KNOW THE FIRST

00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:14.292
PART WAS ABOUT SORT OF THE

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:17.195
ESTIMATE BUT MY ASSUMPTION IS

00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:18.897
THAT REGARDLESS OF IF THEIR

00:28:18.963 --> 00:28:21.232
DISTRICTS THAT ARE- MAKING

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:22.434
THESE KINDS OF SUPPORTS

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.236
AVAILABLE THAT ALL DISTRICTS

00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:27.639
STILL HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE ON

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:29.140
INFRASTRUCTURE COULD YOU COULD

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:30.942
HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:31.709
AND YOU'RE JUST DECIDING THAT

00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:34.712
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. ACTIVATE

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:37.382
IT- SO IS THIS SORT OF TAKING

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:40.385
THAT INTO CONSIDERATION OR IS

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:42.821
THIS OUR ESTIMATES ALSO SORT OF

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:43.388
PREDICATED ON THE FACT THAT

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:44.923
SOME ELITE LIAISE DON'T HAVE

00:28:44.989 --> 00:28:46.558
ANY OF THIS. THE SUPPORTS IN

00:28:46.624 --> 00:28:49.694
PLACE AT ALL- AND HAVE TO BUILD

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:52.831
THAT IN. SENATOR I'D HAVE TO

00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:54.699
GET BACK TO YOU ON ON THAT

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:55.667
LEVEL OF DETAIL OF THE

00:28:55.733 --> 00:28:58.369
ESTIMATE. IF THAT'S OKAY OKAY

00:28:58.436 --> 00:28:59.471
BECAUSE I MEAN YOU KNOW THE

00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:01.072
REALITY IS WHILE WE DON'T KNOW

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:02.040
HOW MANY STUDENTS WOULD BE

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:03.842
USING THIS WE CERTAINLY KNOW.

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:05.376
THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:29:05.443 --> 00:29:06.111
STUDENTS DIDN'T CHECK IN AT

00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:08.746
ALL- AND I THINK THAT'S THE

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:10.348
THING THAT'S MOST CONCERNING TO

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.016
SO MANY OF US THOSE THAT ARE

00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:13.718
PARENTS WHO HAVE KIDS THAT ARE

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:15.520
GOING TO SCHOOL. AND THOSE THAT

00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:16.521
ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT OUR YOUNG

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:18.223
FOLKS GETTING THE EDUCATION

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:21.459
THAT THEY RIGHTLY DESERVE FROM

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:23.661
THIS STATE- SO. YEAH I WOULD BE

00:29:23.728 --> 00:29:25.263
GREAT IF YOU COULD GET BACK TO

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.398

00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:30.168
YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED-

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:33.838
WANT TO SAY TWO THINGS ONE IS

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:35.807
IT. JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THE

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:37.175
FINANCE PROJECTIONS ARE

00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:38.910
COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC AND I

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:40.345
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUT

00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:41.880
THAT ON THE RECORD SHOW THAT

00:29:41.946 --> 00:29:43.982
WHEN WE TALK TO SPILL OUT.

00:29:44.048 --> 00:29:48.219
NOBODY READS THAT- AS AN

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:50.822
AGREEMENT IN JUST HOW OVERBLOWN

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:53.358
THOSE WERE. THE SECOND THING IS

00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:54.792
IN READING ANALYSIS ONE THING

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:56.828
PUSH MY BUTTONS A LITTLE I FEEL

00:29:56.895 --> 00:29:58.730
THE NEED TO SAY IT. THAT SET UP

00:29:58.796 --> 00:30:00.098
ARE YOU GOT A COLLEGE DEGREE

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:04.102
WITHOUT GRADES- YOU KNOW DID

00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:05.603
NOT GET A LETTER GRADE WAS NOT

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.939
REDUCED TO A NUMBER AND NOTHING

00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:09.307
MADE ME CRAZIER THAN PEOPLE

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:11.676
FREAKING OUT SAYING OH MY GOD

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:13.278
THEY DON'T HAVE GRADES WE DON'T

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:14.746
KNOW WHAT TO DO WE CAN'T

00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:17.081
PROCESS THEM. MY COLLEAGUES

00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:18.683
WORK FOR THE PRO TEM WERE

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.285
LEGISLATORS WERE DOCTORS OR

AND WE WEREN'T REDUCED TO GRADE

00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:28.059
SO FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE FREAKING

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:29.727
OUT BECAUSE GRADES ON SHOW UP

00:30:29.794 --> 00:30:31.462
THEY JUST NEED TO GET OVER IT

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:36.968

A CONNECTIVITY MAYBE THEY WERE

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:09.634
WORKING BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS
