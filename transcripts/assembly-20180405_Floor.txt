IF THE PERPETRATOR COMMITTED THEM ACROSS MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS THE LIST OF ELIGIBLE CRIMES CURRENTLY INCLUDE HUMAN TRAFFICKING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE. HOWEVER THIS LIST IS NOT INCLUDE SEXUAL BATTERY OR STATUTORY RAPE. THIS MEANS THAT A SURVIVOR WHO IN DURING ONE OF THESE OFFENSES MUST BE FORCED TO TESTIFY OUT MULTIPLE TRIALS IN FORCED TO RELIVE THIS ORDEAL HERE SHE INJURED. THIS COULD BE VERY TRAUMATIC FOR VULNERABLE SURVIVORS ESPECIALLY CHILDREN. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX WILL SOLVE THIS ISSUE BY ADDING THESE OFFENSES TO THE LIST OF ELIGIBLE CRIMES FOR CONSOLIDATION INTO A SINGLE TRIAL. THIS WILL PROTECT SURVIVORS FROM HAVING TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE TRAUMA THE INJURED I MULTIPLE TRIALS REDUCE COURT COSTS IN ALLOW FIRST READ THE RENDERING OF SWIFT JUSTICE TO THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE HEINOUS CRIMES.

APOLOGIES SHOULD NOT ONLY BE THE END OF A TRAGIC CHAPTER OF OUR HISTORY BUT ALSO THE BEGINNING OF A BOLD AND INCLUSIVE FUTURE.

THIS CULTURE HAS LED TO AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE MANY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE OFTEN BULLIED. SPURIOUS MENTAL DEPRESSION BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE AND HATRED AND BIGOTRY THAT THEY EXPERIENCE.

THAT THE LAWS HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRONG AND THAT IT'S TIME FOR US TO WRITE A NEW HISTORY MOVING FORWARD THING ABOUT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.
