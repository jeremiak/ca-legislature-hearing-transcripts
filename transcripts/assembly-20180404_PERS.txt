THERE YOU GO. GOOD MORNING WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED IN THE. ABSENCE OF A QUORUM WILL START AS SELECT COMMITTEE. WAS TO BE WHAT FOR SOME MEMBERS OF BECOMING THEM. SO THAT I KNOW WE DO HAVE A MEMBER. PRESIDENT YOU HAVE ARE YOUR FOLKS WITH YOU. SO THE FIRST IN WAR HAVE IS AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SOME REMEMBER CHAU CHIU IF YOU GOT. IN YOUR WRITING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND OF THE SOON TO BE CONSTITUTE COMMITTEE. OF AND I KNOW THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING WORKERS IN OUR STATE AND IN PARTICULAR THE RESPONSIBILITY PROTECTING THEM AS A EXERCISE. CRITICAL LEGAL RIGHTS SUCH AS DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A UNION. THIS BILL. AB TWENTY SEVENTEEN WOULD PROHIBIT PUBLIC EMPLOYERS FROM INTERFERING WITH PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WHILE EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO HAVE UNION REPRESENTATION IN THE WORKPLACE. UP. SORRY THAT THE CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS PUBLIC EMPLOYEES FROM INTERFERENCE. BUT THESE PROTECTIONS DO NOT AT THIS MOMENT EXTENT TO PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES PUBLIC EMPLOYERS COULD INTERPRET THE LETTER OF THE LAW TO MEAN THAT THEY COULD A QUESTION A CANDIDATE DURING THE INTERVIEW PROCESS ABOUT THEIR INTENT TO WOOD. TO JOIN A UNION. OUR INTERVIEW  <u><c.green>INTERVIEWEES</c></u> COULD BE THRUST INTO SITUATIONS WHERE THERE INTENT WITH RESPECT TO JOINING A UNION COULD BECOME A RELEVANT TO THEIR CANDIDACY OR JOB APPLICATION. AT THIS IS A LOOPHOLE THAT HAS LEFT SOME ROOM FOR DISCRIMINATION IN THE HIRING PROCESS. AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES LAID OUT IN LAW. WE KNOW THAT IF EMPLOYERS ARE ALLOWED TO SUCCESSFULLY CONVINCE PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES NOT TO BECOME UNION MEMBERS THEY WOULD UNDERMINE THE RIGHT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO FREELY DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO JOIN A UNION. UP SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND HERE TO TESTIFY FROMAS YOU ARE YOU THE BILL'S SPONSOR IS MICHELLE CASTRO. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN STOOD ON THE SHOCK CAPS WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION. AS MR CHIU SAID THIS BILL SIMPLY CLOSING A LOOPHOLE THAT LEFT OUT PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES.

STATE LAW GIVES THE CALPERS BOARD A OF ADMINISTRATION THE AUTHORITY TO APPOINT AND FIX THE COMPENSATION OF ITS C. E. O. GENERAL COUNSEL CHIEF. ACTUARY CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER CFO ANOTHER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT POSITIONS THIS AUTHORITY ALLOWS CALPERS ASCETIC COMPENSATION FOR THESE POSITIONS SO I TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER AGENCIES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR FOR PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES. HOWEVER CALPERS DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO SET THE COMPENSATION FORCE CHIEF HEALTH DIRECTOR OR CHIEF EXIT DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER POSITIONS. HAVING COMPENSATION FOR ITS CHD AND D. E. O. POSITIONS SET BELOW THAT OF SIMILAR AGENCIES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE CALPERS BOARD. TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN TALENT IN THESE POSITIONS A NEAR CONSTANT HIRING PROCESS FOR THESE POSITIONS UNDERMINES CALPERS BOARD. A EXCUSE ME CALPERS ABILITY TO PLAN FOR THE SUCCESSION OF ITS EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND MEET ITS FIDUCIARY DUTIES THIS BILL WILL GIVE THE CALPERS BOARD THE AUTHORITY TO APPOINT AND FIX THE COMPENSATION. FOR. OF THOSE TWO POSITIONS THIS SIMPLY THIS SIMPLE CHANGE WILL ALLOW THE BOARD OF THE.

I THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DID A EXCELLENT JOB PRESENTING Y. THIS MEASURE IS SO NECESSARY AND AND IMPORTANT TO CALPERS. BEING ABLE TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF KEY. LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND AND COMPETE FOR CANDIDATES THAT HAVE. SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL SETS IN THAT ARE HIGHLY QUALIFIED IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR CAL PERS. A AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED CALPERS IS FINDING IT. INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT. TO COMPETE FOR. THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE WERE COMPETING NOT ONLY WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT ALSO WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND SIMILAR RETIREMENT SYSTEMS HOME FOR EXAMPLE. CAL STIRS OUR SISTER AGENCY ACROSS THE THE RIVER JUST RECENTLY. OBTAINED AUTHORITY FOR A CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR THEIR POWER TO UPSET THE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. AND COMPENSATION FOR THAT POSITION. SO PROVIDING CALPERS BOARD THE AUTHORITYTO SET THE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND COMPENSATION FOR CHIEF HEALTH DIRECTOR AND A CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER.

CERVANTES COOLEY. COOPER A COOPER AYE O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL I. OTHER MOTIONS THREE ZERO WERE SHORT ONE SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE ROLE OPEN WHICH ONLY ABOUT. SOME MEMBERS CERVANTES LIKE AT ON TO THIS BUT WE JUST HEARD I WAS. CALDERON SPILL AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTEEN. WE HAVE AN EXTENSION. THE THOUGHT MOTIONS TO BE ON CALL. DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS STORED FOR SOME. SUMMER COOPER. OWN YOUR OKAY GO AT IT REPEAL OF DUTCH COMPUTER THURMAN QUITE. I DID NOT. I THOUGHT WAS THURMAN'S BILL YOU'RE DOING. SO THAT WE HAVE A SUMMER COOPER AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN YOU'RE READY. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY WITH SIMPLY CLARIFY. THAT NOTICE OF NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION SHOULD BE ONLY PROVIDED TO THE NEW EMPLOYEES MANAGEMENT. IN THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THOSE EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT. LAST YEAR AS A RESULT OF CALIFORNIA'S PROJECTED INFLUX OF NEW EMPLOYEES THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED AB ONE NINETEEN. WHICH REQUIRED ALL THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. PROVIDED ORIENTATION. DISORIENTATION WOULD ALLOW NEW EMPLOYEES DEAR FROM BOTH THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION BUT THEIR NEW JOB THE CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS. THE LAW ALSO REQUIRES THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE RECEIVE AT LEAST TEN DAYS ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ORIENTATION UNLESS CIRCUMSTANCES. DON'T PERMIT SUCH NOTIFICATION. KEEPING LOCATION DATE ANTI CONFIDENTIAL PREVENT ORGANIZATIONS FROM ATTENDING IN ORDER TO STRIP THE MEETING AS WELL AS ENSURING EMPLOYEES PRIVACY. A RECENT REPORT BY US PER OF JUSTICE STATISTICS FELT OF THE RATE OF WORKPLACE VIOLENCE IS THREE TIMES HIGHER. PUBLIC SECTOR IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR MOREOVER BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. PERCENT OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SECTOR WORKPLACE VIOLENCE WAS DIRECTED AT LAW ENFORCEMENT OR SECURITY OFFICERS. GIVEN THESE FACTS IS A PAIR THAT WE PROTECT OUR NEW PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ATTENDING ORIENTATION BUT ONLY PROVIDING ADVANCED NOTICE THE PERTINENT PARTIES. OUR SPIFFY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. AND WITH THAT WHEN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAITLIN BAKER FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER'S WORK ON ON IN HELPING US I GET A BILL TO ESTABLISH NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATIONS. WE VIEW THIS BILL REALLY AS A CLEANUP MEAURE. IN THE BILL WE CREATED A NEW ADVANCE NOTICE REQUIREMENT THAT DID NOT PREVIOUSLY EXIST AND BECAUSE OF BAD WE REALIZED AND IT COULD END UP HAVING ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES IT COULD RESULT IN. ADVANCE NOTICE GOING TO PARTIES WHO HAVE. OBJECTIONS WITH PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SPECIFICALLYWITH UNIONS WITH ANY OF THAT THIS IS AN INTERNAL MEETING AND OUR INTENT WITH THIS BILL IS SIMPLY TO KEEP. ADVANCE NOTICE INTERNAL I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLY BROAD WE CERTAINLY DID NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY COULD NOT TELL THE VENDORS THAT ARE COMING TO THE ORIENTATION. TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE EMPLOYEES THE TIME DATE LOCATION OF THE ORIENTATION OF COURSE THAT'S NECESSARY AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE LOGISTICS WORK OUR INTENT WAS JUST THAT THIS IS AN MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES AND THOSE ARE THE PARTIES THAT NEED THE ADVANCE NOTICE. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE MICHELLE CAST OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION JUST WANNA. AFFIRM EVERYTHING SEVEN MISTER COOPER AND MISS VEGA. OUR UNION HAS. REALLY LOOKS AT THIS FOR THE PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEE SAFETY WE HAVE HAD NUMEROUS EMPLOYEES. EXPERIENCE VARYING LEVELS OF VIOLENCE ON THE JOB RANGING FROM BEING SHOT AT. TO BE ATTACKED. IT WE JUST SEE THIS AS ONE STEP IN ENSURING THEIR PRIVACY AND SAFETY SO WE ASK FOR YOUR I. THINK YOU.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST FORTH EACH ON SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND ALSO BEHALF MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO THIS MEASURE A WE UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THE OF THE BILL AND APPRECIATE THE SPONSORS AWARENESS OF SOME OF THE EXISTING CONFLICTS. AYE BUT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THIS COULD ACTUALLY IMPEDE THE VERY PURPOSE OF THE NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATIONS TO INFORM OUR NEWEST MEMBERS PRIDE ABOUT THE RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES. SO I WAS MENTIONS AND I REALLY DO HOPE WE CAN ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM OF MANY AGENCIES DOING BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS. TO EXPLAIN TO NEW EMPLOYEES INFORMATION ABOUT A INSURANCE DEFERRED COMPENSATION OFFERINGS AND OTHER ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR SAFETY AGENCIES. INVITE FAMILY MEMBERS BE PART OF THE BADGE PINNING CEREMONIES THAT TAKE PLACE AS PART OF THOSE ORIENTATIONS. AND THEN FINALLY A SOME ALSO BRING AND THIRD PARTY EXPERTS FOR WORKPLACE SAFETY TRAINING AND HOW TO RESPOND IN AN EMERGENCY OR CRISIS SITUATION. IN THE WORKPLACE. RESPECTFULLY I WANNA SAY THAT WHILE THE COMMITTEE NOW THIS REFLECTS NUMBER A NUMBER OF THEM INCIDENTS UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL OF THOSE ACTUALLY BE OUR RESOLVE TO PROVIDED BY THE PROPOSED ON AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY. I'M SO IN ADDITION TO. THE PROBLEM WITH THEM BY THE THIRD PARTY VENDORS INDICATORS WHICH I THINK WE CAN WORK ON. THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND WE SEE THIS AS BEING A MAJOR CONFLICT WITH THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND THE STANDARD BY WHICH LOCAL AGENCIES MUST CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS. THERE SOME LOCAL AGENCIES THAT HAVE. ADOPTED ORDINANCES THAT ARE EVEN MORE STRENUOUS THAN THE STATE'S PR A THE SUNSHINE ORDINANCES AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE STANDING CONFLICT. AND WE SEE THAT AS A DRAIN ON PUBLIC RESOURCES BECAUSE THE NEED TO RE DOCKED OR. CREATE MORE I'VE AYE PAPERWORK FOR THE PEARY COMPLIANCE IS SIMPLY A DREAM BECAUSE WE CANNOT SEEK REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE PURPOSES SO WE DO HOPE TO CAN YOU WORKING ON BOTH THE APPLICATION OF THE RESTRICTION.
