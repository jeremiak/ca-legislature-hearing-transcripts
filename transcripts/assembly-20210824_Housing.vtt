STRUCTURE FOR DOING. IT FOR

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:14.351
CARRYING THIS OUT. BECAUSE PART

00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:16.019
OF THE AS YOU POINTED OUT PART

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:17.053
OF THE HOUSING ISSUE IS THE

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.523
LAND COSTS AND THAT'S A LARGE

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:23.393
PART OF WHY COST FIVE HUNDRED.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:23.927
THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT TO

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:28.164
BUILD THINGS SO WHAT GETS USED

00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:29.666
AFTER THAT IS A PROBLEM NINETY

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.167
EIGHT MONEY THEY GET USED TO

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:32.936
BUILD IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GONNA

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:34.270
CLEAR THE LAND AND BUILD NEW

00:54:34.337 --> 00:54:35.538
UNITS THAT'S ONE THING IF

00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:36.573
YOU'RE GOING TO CONVERT ANOTHER

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.208
THING THAT'S ANOTHER COST ARE

00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:39.943
WE STILL USING PROP NINETY

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:41.044
EIGHT MONEY FOR THAT OR ARE WE

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:43.013
USING MONEY THAT IS DESIGNATED

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:47.117
IN OUR IN OUR GENERAL FUND FOR-

00:54:47.183 --> 00:54:48.852
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO BE

00:54:48.918 --> 00:54:50.887
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT BECAUSE

00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:52.222
I DON'T THINK A LOT OF

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:53.923
TAXPAYERS ARE REALLY CONCERNED

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:55.692
THAT PROP IN THE PROPER NINETY

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:56.693
EIGHT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY OUT

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.795
OF AND THEN PUT IT IN EDUCATION

00:54:58.862 --> 00:54:59.763
IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:02.198
EDUCATION NOT THE HOUSING PART

00:55:02.265 --> 00:55:05.635
SO IF EDUCATION HAS LAND AND

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:06.936
THEY WANT TO PARTNER UP THE

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:08.838
MONEY FOR THAT SHOULD COME FROM

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:11.274
OUR GENERAL FUND. THAT IT AND

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:12.742
NOT PROP NINETY EIGHT FIVE.

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.544
YEAH SO THAT'S MY QUESTION IS

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:16.112
WE ARE USING PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:18.515
FUNDS TO ACTUALLY BUILD- I

00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:21.251
DON'T NOT THINK SO I'M- ALMOST

00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:23.486
POSITIVE- BUT LET ME ASK-

00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:25.155
MISTER ALAN THESE TO. BE MORE

MORNING- YEAH GOOD MORNING IT'S

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:37.600
AN IMMENSELY ART OUT OF IT IS

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.536
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S A

00:55:39.602 --> 00:55:41.771
LITTLE THAT THE JOINT OCCUPANCY

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.773
IS WORKING WITH THE OPPORTUNITY

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.709

00:55:49.312 --> 00:55:51.414
BUILDING ON ON LAND THAT'S ON

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:52.649
THAT'S NOT BEING USED AT THIS

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:53.883
MOMENT IT IS NOT MY

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.318

DON'T THINK SO BUT I DON'T WANT

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:15.371

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.340
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S NOT

00:56:17.407 --> 00:56:19.109
