REPUTATION OF BEING OUT QUITE A BUILDER FOR SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY AND MY DISTRICTS UP COMBINED- QUESTION. FOR BOTH OF YOU- STIRS OF STAND UP. MISTER MOCKERY SHE AN OUT I'D AND LIKE FIRST BILL ON COBIA. ARE IN THE VACCINATION IS. SO I KNOW. THE SO AND WHO. REQUIRED TO GET FLU SHOPS FLU SHOTS AND NOW WE HAVE. THE CORVETTE VACCINATION AVAILABLE WE KNOW THE SUPPLY OF US CERTAINLY. THE ISSUE AT THE MOMENT BUT DO YOU EXPECT ARE YOU SEE. MAYBE REQUIRING COAL THAT VACCINATIONS. BEFORE THE STUDENTS CAN RETURN TO CAMPUSES THIS FALL WITH THE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE TOTALLY OPEN AND THE SECOND QUESTION BECAUSE I'LL- DO BOTH SO THAT YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. BOTH RESPOND TO IT HAS TO DO WITH THE TESTING. ARE HAVING THE UC SYSTEM MOVE AWAY FROM THE AFTER A C. T. AND THE S. EIGHTEENTH- AND HOW ONE WILL MAKE OUR ADMISSION AND SCHOLARSHIP DECISIONS WITHOUT. THOSE THOSE INSTRUMENTS YET STUDENTS MAY BE REQUIRED TO HAVE. THOSE TERROR FOR APPLICATIONS TO PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES HOW WILL YOU. INTEGRATE TO THEIR OUT WITH DETAILS BUT I BELIEVE YOU'RE DEVELOPING AND TO BE IN PLACE OF. THE SAT AND ACT THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT IF I LOOK AT THROUGH MAY HAVE GRANDCHILDREN THAT ARE CURRENTLY. IN HIGH SCHOOL THINKING ABOUT. THE UC SYSTEM PROBABLY FIRST AND IN THEIR MINDS AND DIED YET BEING REQUIRED OF THE SCHOOLS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY GET SOME BRIEFING RIGHT NOW ON OF THE SAT AND ACT SO. I'LL LEAVE THOSE TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU- AND. TO BE LISTENING INTENTLY THANK YOU- THIS I MAY- IS SOME OF THE TWO. B. H. FIRST WILL THANK YOU THOSE KIND WORDS- IN WAS ALWAYS A- PLEASURE TO- TO BE APART JUST ON THEIR YEAR- DISTRICT AND- I KNOW. ALL OF THE GREAT WORK THAT HAVE DONE- FOR ALL OF THE SUDDEN COUNTY. CITIES OF THAT- THE- THE- HE- ISSUE OF THAT. SELECTION AND- FOR- AND- CORPORATE. I WAS. OF DR BIDEN JUNE- COUPLE IT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT REQUIRE ALL THIS. DIDN'T BEFORE COMING TO THE CAMPUS AND- HER STATEMENT WAS SET AT THE MOMENT. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF ACTIONS TO. PROVIDE YOU- FOR EVERYBODY AND WE WERE JUST GOING TO BE GOING ON LAYERS OF- OF- THE NECESSITIES AS AS YOU KNOW FROM THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS- DOWN TO THE SOCIAL IN SOCIAL FOOD. OF FOOD- WORKERS AND THEN- DOWN TO THE TO THE PROFESSIONS AND- PEOPLE LOVE TO GO AND WORK AT THE LABS ANDDATE THE HOSPITALIZATION THAN THAT DOWN TO WHEN IT BECOMES MORE AVAILABLE- TO REQUIRE THAT'S FOR EVERYBODY BUT AT THE MOMENT AND ANSWER THIS A- SEASON KNOW THE ANSWER IS NO ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR. ACTUALLY BEING VACCINATED. THE SECOND QUESTION REGARDING THE S. A. T. AND C. T. I BOARDED THE- LIMITING TO ACTUALLY CHOOSE TO TEACH ADDITIONAL. FOR STUDENTS THE- KNOW HOW IT IS. FOR APPROVED THOSE OF US WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE THIS IS. RIGHT IN FRONT OF A- TO TAKE THOSE K. TO ESTO AND THE EXTRA OF THE- BETTER THIS TIME ARE BOTH TO GO SHOULD I. SURE WE ARE GOING TO OF TRUE. CREATE OR OWN TEST. SHOW THAT THE- OF X. AT THE U. FOOTBALL THE AFTER AND- FOR THE- CORRECT- HE'S NOT GOING TO- LOWER. SHELF THAT WE- I'VE BEEN TO THE- AND THE PRESS BUSH AND ARE WORKING- CHIU PUT. A USUALLY REQUIRE TEN. BUT AS YOU KNOW IT'S VERY TOUGH TO SOME DOES COVER IT. AND EQUITABLE AND ALSO- WE ACCESSIBLE. OF FOR EVERY SO WE HOPE TO THE IN THE FUTURE WE CAN COME BACK TO AN- AND HAVE SPECIFIC ARE. TO WHAT THE SCHEDULING THE- AND ALSO THE PUBLISHER OF ASKED THAT TEST. OF STATUS IS GOING TO BE. THANK YOU. ANYTHING YOU WANT ADD- WHAT WHAT THANK YOU SO BATES LET ME JUST ADD ON THE OF THAT- YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT THERE ISN'T AN THE SUPPLY AND THEIR NOW WE CAN. SAID THE EVERYBODY- YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HAVE SAFE CAMPUSES AND IF THAT REQUIRES PEOPLE TO BE VACCINATED TO BE IN PERSON I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA CERTAINLY HAVE TO LOOK AT. I UNDERSTAND WHY THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT TO GET VACCINATED I DO BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE EXCEPTIONS TO IT AS WELL- BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT EVEN A REAL DISCUSSION BECAUSE THE- SUPPLY VACCINATIONS DOESN'T EXIST. ON THE SAT ACT ISSUE- I TO VOTED TO- IN TO MAKE THAT GO AWAY I HAD FELT THAT THE TEST WAS UNFAIR. I CAN GIVE YOU LOTS OF REASONS WHY IT'S UNFAIR- AND- AND WE WERE ASSURED THAT THE NEW TEST WAS GOING TO BE DEVELOPED. IN IN ALL CANDOR I'M SKEPTICAL OF THE NEW TESTS I'M SKEPTICAL FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS- I'M SKEPTICAL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. UNDERTAKING TO CREATE A NEW TASK AND- I DON'T WANT TO GO SPEND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ON A NEW TEST TO FIND OUT WHERE IN THE EXACT SAME SITUATION WE WERE WITH THE SAT AND ACT- I HAVE SCHEDULED MEETINGS WITH A NUMBER OF THE- HEADS OF ADMISSIONS INCLUDING- OF THE UCLA FOLKS. BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE HOW. THIS CYCLE OF ADMISSIONS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WORK. AND HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO ADMIT STUDENTS WITHOUT USING THE TASK. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO TAKE A REALLY GOOD LOOK AT. WHAT WHAT HAPPENED WITH OUR DIVERSITY. ABLE TO HAVE A DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION WITHOUT THE TEST. AND I THINK THAT DATA WILL BE FORTHCOMING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT. THANK YOU FOR THOSE RESPONSES- LET ME JUST MAKE A CLOSING LARA CROFT COMMENT ON THE TESTING BECAUSE- BACK IN THE DARK AGES WHEN I WAS APPLYING FOR COLLEGE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT I AM THE SENIOR SENIOR MEMBER HERE- WHAT THEY USE AT THAT TIME IT WAS THE COMBINATION OF A GRADE POINT. AVERAGE AND HOW MANY% AIZEN BEES YOU ARE ACHIEVED IN YOUR VERY OUTSIDE COLLEGE PREP CLASSES. YEAH THAT SEEMS TO BE A VERY FAIR UP WAY TO DO IT AND ALSO WAS VERY INCENTIVIZING FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING TO THE UC SYSTEM. AS A PLACE THAT THEY WILL I WANTED TO GO AND IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS EASIER TO GET INTO UCLA WHICH WAS THE BIG SCHOOL- FOR GRADUATION FROM. THE AREA IN WHICH I LIVE SO ONE MIGHT TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. THAT SURELY SHOWS A STUDENTS COMMITMENT TO HIS STUDY A COMMITMENT TO THE ISSUE AREAS HE WANTS TO PURSUE AND HIS CAREER PATH. HIS OR HERSELF THAT'S JUST A LITTLE- HISTORICAL INSIGHT. BUT THANK YOU AGAIN BOTH OF YOU FOR INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO THIS INCREDIBLE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS THAT. STANDS ABOVE MOST YET YOU KNOW OUR NATION. AND OUR BEST WISHES TO YOU AS YOU CONTINUE YOUR SERVICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SENATOR CENTER LAWYER. THANK YOU VERY. FROM IT ONLY JUST MAKE BRISCOE NOT TO. AND ALL THE START THEM. WITH THE DIFFERENT REGION EACH TIME. JUST THE ARE I HAD A LONG MEETING WITH EACH ONE THEM AND IT WAS VERY. HELPFUL AND ABLE TO GO OVER. THERE AS SOMEBODY THAT WAS ONCE MAYOR OF A CITY THAT HOUSE DO YOU SEE THERE ARE MYRIAD OF ISSUES. THAT COME UP. AND ALSO. MANY THINGS THAT ARE CONCERNED WHETHER IT'S DIVERSITY WORDS HAVING ENOUGH SPACES. WHETHER IT'S LABOR RELATIONS OF OUR HEADS AND WE HAD A CHANCE TO GO THROUGH THE MALL. SO LET ME JUST ASK TO FOR THE RECORD AND. AND REGION OF MOSCOW READ SHE AND OUR I WILL BEGIN WITH YOU F. NF WAS UP IN OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY YOUR BACKGROUND IN DEVELOPMENT REALLY HELPED. IN YOU LOOKING AT ALL THE DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN TRYING TO IMPOSE SOME SENSE OF A BUSINESS MODEL ON IT- COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT PLEASE R. Y. ARE YOUR SERVICE IS HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION WELL- OFTEN TIMES- WE ARE PROUD- PRIVATE SECTOR- WHEN WE PLAN TO DO A PROJECT WE WILL BE A CLOSE ALONE YOU KEEP ALL OF THE INFORMATION CLOSE TO OUR CHEST. AND REVEAL AS LITTLE INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE TO THE CONTRACTORS TO ENSURE SUPPLIERS AND- AND THEN- AND- WE'VE DESIGNED SOMETHING THEN GO FOR- PRICING AND GETTING THE- THE BEST POSSIBLE- NUMBER- THAT WE CAN GET DOWN TO THE PROJECT. UNIVERSITAIRE CUT CALIFORNIA OPERACIJA THE REAR PART OF IT IS THE CLOSEST IN THE LAW FOR OF IT IS BECAUSE OF THE- THE HISTORY ACT ON AND PAN. AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THE EXTRA OF SOME OF THE COUNTRY- SPECIALLY- THE SPECIALTY SPECIALTY FIELD. UP BECAUSE OF THE MEGA. THEY UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE TO COME TO THE REGION'S RELEASED THEIR PROJECTS- DISCUSSION GET A BUDGET TOGETHER AND THEN GO OF THEM VISITED FOR THE FIRST FOR THE BEST **** OBVIOUSLY CONTRACTORS AND- MATERIAL SUPPLIERS MUST LEARN OF THE BUDGET. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S SHOWN ON OUR YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS 20% HIGHER THAN. WHAT I CAN BUILD A STRONG GOING TO GIVE YOU 80% THEY'RE JUST GONNA CME VERY VERY CLOSE TO THE BUDGET. CHAU IT AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE REGULATIONS THEY HAVE TO DO CERTAIN THINGS SO WHAT I HAVE DONE OR WHAT I. HAVE USED MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT. WHEN THEY THE APPROACH TO THE COULD FIVE LAW AT DATA. THE D. OF COSTA NAY SHE IN SAID AREAS. THROUGH HIGH. THEN ON MYERS. I SORT OF REJECT THE PROJECT CAN AND FORCE THEM TO GO BACK AND REVISIT. AN OFTEN IS HAS ENDED UP- SAVING IN REVERSING THERE ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN AS AN EXAMPLE I COULD USE. ONE OF THE MOST RECENT WHICH WAS- UNIVERSAL CITY- THE SAN DIEGO CAMPUS THAT THE THEY HAD BID- A PROJECT- FOR- THE STUDENT HOUSING. AND AND I LOOKED AT THE WHOLE THING- AND SHE TO ME THAT THE- COST US THE PARKING WHICH- WAS. THREE TIMES TO FOUR TIMES pHIGHER THAN. WHAT WE WERE BUILDING IN OTHER AREAS IN- CALIFORNIA. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD GONE TO THE AND- FLYER AND A FORTUNE TO GO BACK AND WITHIN THREE MONTHS. THEY WENT FROM LUNCH WE JUST NEEDING TO THE NEXT MAJOR RESISTANCE THEY CAME BACK WITH ABOUT EIGHTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN. SAVINGS THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF AREAS OF MY EXPERIENCE HAS HAS HELPED AND- MANY EXAMPLES OF THOSE THAT I CAN TELL YOU BUT. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME. ABOUT A- THAT'S THAT'S FOR WOULD BE USING MY- PRIVATE PRO ANA. HOLDS TRUE IF I BRING AND NASH PER. TOGETHER SO THAT THE WE THE POWER OF THE IN. WHICH WE SPOKE CLOSE TO FOUR DOLLARS PER YEAR. IN ADDITION BECAUSE SHE- PROJECTS THAT'S A- OF POWER THAT WE CAN WE CAN. ON PURCHASE GETTING DISCOUNTS. THANK YOU VERY. AND IT JUST FOR MY- FOR. FOUR WHEN I IN THIS. ONE OF THE IS THAT BUILDING WOULD BECOME. IT AFTER YOU SEE CAMPUS. AND BOND MONEY WAS AVAILABLE AND THEY WOULD JUST YOU. KNOW IF MONEY TO BUILD THE BUILDING AND THEN THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE MONEY FOR THE MEDICATIONS AND THEY WOULD FALL ON EVERYBODY ELSE. AND I FINALLY GOT LANGUAGE. WHICH I WAS HAPPY LET THEM. FOR A- IN THE BUDGET THAT STILL WOULD. THAT YOU SEE CAN'T MONEY FOR NEW BUILDING TELL TO MITIGATE. THE WHAT'S COME FROM THE LAST BUILDING AS A WAY TO FORCE THEM TO PUT IT IN THEIR BUDGET TO DO IT TODAY. AND THEN OF COURSE WE STOPPED OF IN BONDS TO MINUTE OUT. OF THAT GOT THERE. THE OTHER QUESTION FOR REGION A REGION SUESS. WE TALKED YESTERDAY ABOUT OUR- SORT OF GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE- ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS IS UC STRUGGLES TO HAVE ENOUGH SLOTS FOR STUDENTS BUT IT'S DOING ON TO EXISTING CAMPUSES WITH TO GETTING MORE MORE CHANGED. AND I KNOW THERE'S ONE OPTION TO THE- THE REGION'S MIGHT CONSIDER ABOUT MILES COLLEGE. AND OTHERS AND I WONDERED IF YOU WOULD SPEAK TO JUST. YOUR VIEW OF HOW YOU SEE WILL HANDLE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL OUR GROWTH IN STUDENTS. OBVIOUSLY WE DID SPEAK ABOUT THAT AND MILLS COLLEGE IS- SOMETHING THAT WE ARE LOOKING INTO TO OUR- THERE'S NOT. THERE IT IS AND- HAS SOME DEEP FINANCIAL ISSUES AND THERE MIGHT BE AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY COMING FORTH. FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND PARTICULARLY BERKELEY TODAY TO TAKE A TO PICK UP SOME OF THE ASSETS OF THAT UNIVERSITY AND THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE ONGOING I THINK- LOOK WE ALL WANT TO EDUCATE THE- THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF STUDENTS YOU KNOW PREFERABLY CALIFORNIANS- AND GROWTH IS GOING TO BE ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ISSUES. I THINK WHAT THE BALANCING ACT IS HOW DO YOU GROW AND MAINTAIN EXCELLENCE- WHEN WE SEE THESE- COLLEGE RANKINGS COME OUT THEIR IMPORTANT TO US WE WANT TO SEE THE MOST NUMBER OF OUR CAMPUSES AND UP IN THE TOP FIFTY UNIVERSITIES. IN THE COUNTRY AND SO GROWTH IS IMPORTANT BUT THE MAINTAINING MAINTAINING EXCELLENCE IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT'S THE BALANCING ACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE- BE JUDGING GOING FORWARD. MILLS COLLEGE COULD BE AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY IT WILL BE INVESTIGATED LIKE NO OTHER AND IF THE OPPORTUNITY IS- MAKES SENSE- WE WILL PURSUE. A POSSIBILITY OF AN AFFILIATION OR PURCHASE OF WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE EARLY FOR THAT AT THE MOMENT. OKAY THANK YU I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU ARE ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR BREAUX. THANK YOU MADAM PRETEND I'M AGAIN I ECHO MY COLLEAGUES' COMMENTS ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO BOTH OF YOU AT TODAY IT WAS A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION I THOUGHT I REALLY APPRECIATED THE FACT THAT BOTH OF YOUR- BUSINESS OWNERS ARE BUSINESS LEADERS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- HAVE THE- NO ONE IS A COMMON SENSE OF THE SENSE TO APPROACH- SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES THAT THAT THIS SYSTEM THE- SYSTEM HAS- AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER. FROM A BUSINESS APPROACH- WHEN APPROPRIATE. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IS- YOU KNOW TO CREATE A STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE IN OUR SYSTEM ARE YOU UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS WE HAVE TO HAVE. GOOD QUALITY- OUTSTANDING STAFF AND LEADERSHIP. AND I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS THAT YOU KNOW GIVEN THE BUDGET THAT WE'VE HAD WITH LOST REVENUE OVER THE HEALTH AND HOSPITAL WITH THE MONEY THAT WAS LOST THERE PLUS HOUSING AND EVENTS. AND A BUDGET DEFICIT I GUESS YOU'D SAY I'M AND FUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT TWENTY. BILLION DOLLARS- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE BUDGET COMING FORTH TO HELP FILL THAT GAP AND STILL RECRUIT TOP TALENT. SO THAT WE REMAIN S. AT OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM REMAINS A STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN WE COMPETE WITH OTHER STATES. I NEED TO OUR SERVER AND- SURE THE LOS ANGELES THANK YOU FOR THE TIME YOU SPEND WITH US THIS MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I THINK- AS YOU KNOW UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN FACED WITH THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE. AS FAR AS THE FINANCES ARE CONCERNED AND- HAVING THE- SHARE THE FINANCE COMMITTEE RAN COLLUDED- SITUATION HIT- RIGHTS LAST FEBRUARY MARCH. WE INVEST IN THE IN THE- I MEAN EITHER THAT WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T DAYS OR WEEKS WE JUST REALLY JUMPED ON EVERYTHING I HAVE OF MYSELF I HAD. WITH OUR CFO AND- TRY TO STOP EVERY TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING INTERNAL SESSIONS AND THEY'RE NOT TALKED ABOUT THIS STOP EVERY TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE FOR US SHE WAS THAT THAT WASN'T NECESSARY OF COULD BE DELAYED. THERE STARTED REFINISHING EVERYONE OFF OR OLD THAT AND- TO TAKE TOOK TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE LOWER RATES WE WANT TO THE MARKET AND RAISE SOME FUNDS. A VERY VERY LITTLE ROOM. LOW WRETCHEDNESS AT ABOUT TO BILL DOLLARS IN THEN THEY WILL ANOTHER- HAPPILY A SEARCH WAS KILLED GAPS AND WITH THE INITIAL. CARE FUNDS- MEDICAL CENTER IS ORDER THROUGH. CALLS TO ABOUT SIX HUNDRED TERM LOAN DOLLARS AND THEN THE FIRST CARES ACT NEW SHOES TO HARM THAT IT WAS THREE AND EIGHTY. EIGHTY DOLLARS WAS WHICH HUNDRED OR WAS WAS MORE WORST- AS AND THEN DO OTHER HUNDRED THIRTY WAS FOR. AND THEN THE SECOND TRUMP THAT IN WITH AND MEET. UM DO- THE TO. OF THAT WAS ABOUT THE AGE THEY BELIEVE IT LAST HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE NINE AGAIN HI THIRTY ONE FOR STATE NAY DOWN THE BALANCE OF HIS WENT THE CAMPUS IS. SO THE COMBINATION OF COURSE SAVINGS COMMITTEE OF REALLY WE- AGAIN THE AND- GET D. H. WE'VE TRIED. FILL IN THE GAP SPACE IN EVERY OF THE HOSPITALS AS YOU KNOW THE MEDICAL CENTERS PROVIDED THE UNIVERSITY OR CLOSE TO FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ALL OF SUDDEN. THEY WERE JUST TOTALLY STOPPED WE COULDN'T TAKE ANY- ANY ELECTIVE SURGERIES AND- AND EVERYTHING WENT TO OVERREACH SHOW THAT REVENUE STOP ALL OF YOUR EVERY YEAR. PARKING'S AND HOW STRANGE OF STUDENT HOUSING FOOD SERVICES STATE BASED OFF OF THOSE REVENUES THEY WERE PROVIDING RUSSIA OF FUNDING BETWEEN. THE UNIVERSITY OPERATIONS BASED SO BETWEEN THE TRUE WE FILL THE GAP AND WE WERE ABLE TO OPERATE AT AS YOU RELATION TO- THE BIG GAP IN- RETIREMENT SAVINGS- THE- IT THAT'S MOSTLY RELATED TO THE STOCK MARKET AND AS AS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR. OF OVER. TWO YEARS AGO JUST ON THE PHONE THING WAS ABOUT 60% OR IT WAS SEVEN. I THINK OUR A BILL DOLLARS. AND TODAY THAT'S- YOU USE YOUR POS IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR. AND THIS PAST YEAR FOR THE MONTH- THE END IS GOING 6% SO- EVEN THOUGH OUR FUND GAVE STILL AT 85% SO PERCENT. I THINK WITHIN- WITH STOCK MARKET NONCHALANT. OF THE UNIVERSE HAS INCREASED EMPLOYER EMPLOYER- I THINK WE'LL BE TO FILL THE BACKUP AND WE ARE HOPING. THAT THE STATE WILL COME. SOME THE RICH I MEANT THE- OF- RETIREES TO WHICH I FUND LIKE YOU DO FOR- FOR. SHOW WITH THE I THINK IF YOU ANY OTHER MOVE A- QUESTIONS YOU WHEN I WAS ME ABOUT EACH OF THE ACTUALLY THE RETIRED THE- AND- THE BE HAPPY TO ANSWER. YES NOT SIR THANK YOU FOR MUCH AND THE CONVERSE WE HAD THE MORNING AND RESPOND TO THAT. I DO A- IT I LOOK FOR TO SOME YOU. BOTH OF YOU. YES MA'AM. IF YOU DID. TO A QUESTION. THAT THAT EXTRA MISTER SERVICE. I YEAH OKAY BUT I THINK IT WAS OKAY YEAH SIR I'M THANK YOU- SENATOR MR MATURE LEADER GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO- IN SOME OF THE THAT WERE TO BRING THE ATTENTION THE PUBLIC THE FIRST OF THE MILLS COLLEGE THE SECOND THE CHALLENGES- OF RECRUITING TALENT IN THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY WHEN WE HAVE SOME PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES THERE STILL ARE PEOPLE IN PAIN A LOT OF MONEY IT'S A IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE AND I ALSO WANTED TO. GIVE HATS OFF TO- RIGID MARK RHAETIAN FOR HIS EFFORTS ON THE REFINANCE I WATCH THAT CLOSELY AND THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY QUITE. OF THE- INSIGHTFUL IN TERMS OF REDUCING COSTS AND DEBT AND REFINANCING THOSE OBLIGATIONS. AT SIGNIFICANT LOWER INTEREST RATES. ARM IN A AND I KNOW THAT J. IS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE ISSUES OF- THE- THE LABS AND THE SECURITY CLEARANCES THAT HE HAS TO ENGAGE IN THE HARD WORK THE GATE THEY GIVE YOU GET CREDIT FOR THAT I JUST WANTED TO SEE WITH A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ONE IT WAS I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME EFFORTS AFOOT AT THE BOARD OF REGENTS DEALING WITH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE WERE TWELVE THOUSAND PATENTS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY- THE ACADEMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR CHICAGO UNIVERSITY MICHIGAN IT WAS A WASHINGTON STANFORD TO SOME EXTENT THEY HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE- AGGRESSIVE YOU THE SCHOOL AFTER THE BUSINESS SCHOOL AT UCLA GOT SIX OR MILLION DOLLARS ON A RECENT TRANSACTION IN TERMS OF REVENUE STREAM AND EXPLOITING OF THOSE THOSE ASSETS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE ARGUE ALL THE TIME ABOUT. UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BEING THIS GREAT JAM OF CALIFORNIAN WITH A SIMPLE XR AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ONE OF THE GREAT IMPACTS IS THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT COMES OUT OF THE UNIVERSITIES JUST WANTED TO GET BOTH REGION'S THOUGHTS ON THAT IN TERMS OF THE EFFORTS AFOOT. AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING GOING FORWARD. NO MR MAJORITY LEADER THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION YOU LOOK THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMING OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA I DO THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A DEEPER LOOK. AT A HOW WE COMPENSATE THE CREATORS OF THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. AS AS HADI HAS SAID BEFORE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE IN TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE EXCELLENCE WE HAVE EMPLOYEES I USE THE OUR FORMER HEAD OF THE MEDICAL CENTER. WHO IS MAKING A MILLION TO A YEAR WAS WAS RECRUITED BY AN EAST COAST COMPANY. FOR A SIX MILLION DOLLAR SALARY AND HE RAN AWAY FROM THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIAN ABOUT TEN SECONDS. WE'RE NEVER GONNA PAY SOMEBODY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO RUN A MEDICAL CENTER. WHAT I DON'T THINK THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT IS. THAT OUR COACH THE ADVOCATING. FOR THOSE THAT ARE CREATING. VERY VERY VALUABLE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. POSSIBLY A MORE FAIR SHARING AGREEMENT WITH THEM WHICH WOULD IN MY OPINION WHAT INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR BEST FOOT FORWARD TO STAY. CREATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE'RE GONNA TAKE A DEEPER LOOK INTO IN THE IN THE COMING MONTHS HERE. WHICH MIGRATION YOUR THOUGHTS. UP IN THE MAJORITY RETURN FOR SCHOOL- HELLO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND- THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ALL OF THE CALIFORNIANS AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- BUT THE LET ME LET ME GO BACK TO DISH THE TOOLS- THOUSAND PATENTS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST- REGISTER.

OF COMMERCE- CLAUSE SLASH AND THE PATENTS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OF CREATES ARE UNBELIEVABLY NOT ONLY THEY SAVE HUMAN LIVES WELL LET'S LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THE GREEN ENERGY LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT- YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT CARBON TAX AND- AND ALL THAT STUFF BUT JUST ONE PERSON ONE PATTON. OF FROM- SANTA BARBARA SHUJI NAKAMURA IS A NOBEL PRIZE WINNER AS YOU KNOW IS IN SANTA BARBARA AND A SINGLE HANDEDLY SAVED THE ENTIRE WORLD YOU CALL THEM TO TURNING OFF ALMOST ELECTRICITY. AND ZERO AND THAT'S HIS GROUP CREATION WAS LED LARGE NOW UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA IS TRYING TO GO BACK AND COLLECT ON SOME OF THOSE- ROYALTIES THE HOME DEPOT ALL OF THE LED LIGHTS AROUND THE ABOVE ME AROUND THE AGE ALL OF OUR WHO. TELLS ALL FOR A UNIVERSITIES IN THAT IS DOORS ON THE PATENT STATE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS CREATED AND WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE DEFINITELY. THE TAKE- THEN SHE JUST WAS WHEN I JOINED THE FIRST ON THE GEORGE OF THE UNIVERSITY TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AGO. THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS REMEMBER LOOKING. BUT I HAD THE SAME EXACT. QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE AND THEN WHEN I WAS SHE WAS A- DEEP. AND BE CLASS WAS EVEN ON ANYBODY RADAR. IT WAS ERA EVERY CAMPUS OTHERWISE THE LITTLE PATH AND TRANSFER AND WHEN I THE THEN. PRISON YOU I'VE MADE MOTIONAL ABOUT IT PRESENT YOUR OFFER DAY- SHOW OF CORRUPTION SAID WHAT REGION ARE. ARE YOU CHAIR YOU YOU GO ON TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO HE SAID OF A- EACH DOUBLE AND SHE WAS WE COULD DO I REFER OF. THE. THE ONE OF THE CAN. THEY HAD. LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND WHAT CALL THE NIGHT INTO ON THE NATIONAL DO YOU IT JUST AS TO WHICH- VALUE. THIS WE DON'T DO IS JUST LIKE A IT IS WITH WORLD I KNEW IS ON THE RIGHT. IN FACT IF YOU LOOK THE HIS- OR HAVE YOUR SAY TO LOOK SOME THE RECORDS THAT ARE NOT A JUST SENATE ON THE RECORD. HE SAID IT'S NOT PLAYING- THE- THE- CALIFORNIA LOTTERY WHO PUTTING MONEY TO HOLD ME. THEY DID NOT HAVE A- SET UP. TO STUDY EVERY ONE OF THOSE PATENTS AND JUST LIKE THE BIG FUNDS IS. THAT THEY COME IN AND BUY THE BATONS OR OR TAKE THE PATENTS AND GIVE THE UNIVERSITY A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. I SUGGESTED THAT WE SET UP SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND AFTER THE AFTER WAS A BIG TOOK ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS- BUT NOW THEY HAVE DETECTORS FOR- FISHNETS UNDER DO YOU USE YOUR PH AND ALSO- THE HIRED SOME. THE ORDER I SHOULD SAY I HIRED A DIVISION PRESIDENT OVERTURE PRESS FIRED SOMEBODY THAT'S NOW GETTING PAID FROM. THE REGION'S- BUT- AND HE'S YOU IN AT EXACT WHAT THE YOU. ABOUT SO THAT THAT'S IMPROPER. AN OFFICE BEEN UP. I DON'T THAT THE FUTURE- FOLLOW IT BOTH AND I. AND ALL THE REASONS FOR INTO. I GET ENTIRE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SURE. I'M TRYING. YEAH I JUST THINK THAT END OF THE DAY I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE MONEY TO BE MADE AS A RESOURCE FOR THE UNIVERSITY. AND WELL AS A INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO SPLIT WITH THE CITY CALIFORNIA- TO EXPLOIT THAT I ACTUALLY- SPEAKING OF UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA ACTUALLY- WORKED ON A PROJECT WITH ONE OF THOSE NOBEL LAUREATES IN PHYSICS OF YEARS AGO WHEN I LEFT GOVERNMENT. BASED UPON- THE GENIUS IDEA THAT WAS THOUGHT OF BY THAT INDIVIDUAL SO. BUT NO I REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANKS THANK YOU BOTH I THINK THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO NUMBER THE QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ASK THE HEAD OF MY NOTES HAVE BEEN ASKED BY MY COLLEAGUES SO.

THE TENTATIVE DEAL REACHED WITH THE GOVERNOR TO RESTORE THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN CUTS FOR A MILLION DOLLARS IN CUTS THAT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL FOR OPERATION- I LOOK AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS.

BOB OTHER ISSUE I WANT YOU IN OUR INTERVIEW ELOISE. IN THE PUBLIC ARENA. DISCUSSION WE HAD REGARDING DEFENSIBLE SPACE OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S A VERY BIG THING FOR US THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR. LEGISLATORS IN BOTH HOUSES THAT REPRESENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY IN FIRE. CHALLENGE JERRY AND AS WE ARE ENGAGING ON PACKAGES AND DISCUSSIONS FOR LEGISLATION AND BUDGET REQUESTS ON DEFENSIBLE SPACE. OFTEN THE ISSUE IS IMPLEMENTATION YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT AN IDEA. BUT WHO'S ON THE GROUND THAT ACTUALLY HOW DOES THAT WORK HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEBODY TO GO TO CUT THE TREES DOWN THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS. HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH FOLKS WHERE THERE'S A CHALLENGE TO THE COMMUNITY ON THE ONE HAND IN TERMS OF FIRE RISK AND YET PEOPLE ON THE OTHER HAND. TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT AND YOUR OFFICE IS THE OFFICE AS WE ENGAGE IN THIS POLICY. IT'S GOING TO BE THE FACE OF THIS AND SO I WANTED TO GET SOME OF YOUR INSIGHTS. ABOUT HOW YOU INTEND TO DEAL WITH THIS IN THE VERY HUMAN. WAY THAT MEETS OUR GOALS ON THE ONE HAND AND YET- IS RESPECTFUL TO PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES ON THE OTHER. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR. AND YOU KNOW WE DO RESPECT THE PROPERTY OWNERS- PROPERTY AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM WHEN WE SHOW UP OR SOMEONE SHOWS UP AND TELLS THEM THAT THEY HAVE TO REMOVE VEGETATION. BUT WE ALSO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THE CRITICALITY OF IT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED FEET OF SPACE THAT OUR CREWS CAN OPERATE IN THAT WILL SLOW THE PROGRESSION OF THE FIRE AND GIVE OUR FIRE CREWS A CHANCE TO SAVE THEIR HOME. NOW WE ALSO OFFER THEM OPPORTUNITIES FOR- YOU KNOW NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITY THAT CAN THAT CAN PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THEM- BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE QUITE A CHALLENGE. AND THERE WERE UP TO THE TASK OF THE GOVERNOR- HAS PROVIDED US WITH EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT ADDITIONAL FIREFIGHTERS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE OUT DOING THAT DOING DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND THEY'LL ALSO BE DOING SOME SOME OF. YOUR CREWS WORK- SO- YOU KNOW IT'S THE LAW WE UNDERSTAND THAT BUT- REALLY IT'S A PERSONAL THING AND SO WE TAKE THE EDUCATION APPROACH AND WE'LL ABOUT 80% COMPLIANCE RATE. ON OUR FIRST INSPECTIONS WITH ARE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU GUYS FOLLOW YES. YEAH I GET THE FANTASTIC I GET IT AND I THINK THE HEARING FIFTY EIGHT NEW PERSONNEL IS GREAT. IT JUST WORRIES ME AS WE ENGAGE YOU ALL.

AND LAST WEEK THERE WAS A STORY IN THE LOCAL MEDIA THE COMMUNITY THAT I REPRESENTS WHERE A GENTLEMAN SAT ON THE PHONE FOR NINE HOURS. AND THAT WAS THE STORY RIGHT NOT THE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WE SERVED AND I JUST AS AS WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE IN THE CALIFORNIA SENATE. TO HAVE LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT IS BECAUSE IT REFLECTS ON ALL OF US IN GOVERNMENT WHETHER WE'RE ELECTED OR APPOINTED OR CONFIRMED. A TERMS OF PEOPLE HAVING CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT SO ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES I THINK WE'RE GONNA SIGNIFICANT RISK COMING THIS FIRE SEASON IN THE HEAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO SUFFER. AND THE LIKE WITH STREAM CLIMATE CONDITIONS AND THAT PLEASE JUST IN EVERY RESPECT POSSIBLE TO GO THE DISTANCE TIMES TEN TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE TREATED WITH RESPECT. AND THAT WE DON'T END UP HAVING THOSE NINE OUR- MEDIA CAUGHT THE REPORTS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD CHALLENGE I KNOW IT'S NOT PERFECT AND WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY OF HUMAN BEINGS BUT I JUST WANTED TO STRESS THAT. AS. MUCH AS I POSSIBLY COULD ISSUE IN J. IS VERY CHAO. AND ANYTHING YOU VERY MUCH SIR. THANK YOU ARE. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MADAM I'M- THANK YOU NUMBER ONE OF ACCEPTING THIS HUGE CHALLENGE OF BEING THE STATE'S FARMERS AND THAT TAKES COURAGE AND SO THINK YOU FOR THAT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- IT WAS GREAT TO MEET WITH YOU AND I SHOULD INDICATE THAT WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER BEFORE AND GO OUT OF THEIR OFFICES ARE DECISION IN A GOOD WAY FOR ME UP WE HAD A LIKE THE TALK AND I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD ASK ONE QUESTION. OF BERGEN ON THE RECORD AND THAT IS IN. IN THE LAST DECADE THE FIRE MARSHAL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING BUILDING STANDARDS INSPECTIONS. AND THERE WAS THIS INCREDIBLE BACKLOG AND IT WAS WORKED. TO BE ELIMINATED AND I WAS JUST GONNA ASK WHAT'S THE STATE OF THE BACKLOG AND IF AND WHEN. AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE CONFIRMED. WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO MAKE SURE ANOTHER BACKLOG DOESN'T ACCUMULATE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR LAYERED AND I'M AND YOU KNOW YOU WERE AGENCY SECRETARY WHEN WE WERE GOING THROUGH A THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN HELPING US TO THE RIGHT SIZE THAT FIRE LIFE SAFETY DIVISION. NOW WE WERE SUFFERING FROM. A VACANCY RATE OF ABOUT 44% WE'VE BEEN A READ IS. AND WE WORKED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION- TO. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DO A WORKLOAD ANALYSIS A DEEP DIVE INTO WHAT IT INTO WHAT CARTER. STRIPS STATUTORY ROLE AND RISK. ARE AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT YOU KNOW WE WERE UNDERSTAFFED. AND WE WERE THANKFUL THAT- IT MINISTRATION AND CORSET APARTMENT FINANCE HELPED US TO WRITE A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD JUMP. OUR STAFFING SIGNIFICANTLY WE ALSO AUGMENTED OR DEPUTY STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S WITH. ARCHITECTS AND MECHANICAL ENGINEER AND WE HAVE NOW IMPLEMENTED ELECTRONIC PLAN REVIEW WHICH ELIMINATES THE BACK AND FORTH MAILING OF THESE LARGE PLANS WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE BACKLOG. AND YOU'RE ON TO PAINTING OF FOR YOU OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE THAT WE HAVE NOW THE RESOURCES AND SO- YOU KNOW OUR OUR TURNAROUND TIME IN PLAN REVIEW. IS PROBABLY A MONTH AT THE MOST- I DON'T HAVE THE CURRENT NUMBERS FOR YOU. BUT IT IS IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN IT WAS. AT THE COMPLAINTS HAVE CERTAINLY GONE DOWN RIGHT I'M USED TO. GET CALLS FREQUENTLY FROM HER MANY SAVE A HOUSE FROM BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND TO TALK ABOUT. THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND I'M SURE. THAT HAS TO BE A REAL MOTIVATION. INVENTION YES SIR- BUT WE GOT IT FIXED AND YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL NOT RESTORE WORK WITH THAT OF TRYING THERE MISSION BASED BUDGET REVIEW TO CONTINUE THAT ANALYSIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO BE RIGHT SIZED. AS YOU KNOW THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INSPECTIONS ARE GOING I MEAN CONSTRUCTION THAT IS GOING ON DOWNTOWN NOW WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO OCCUPY IN OUR NEW RESOURCES BUILDING HERE AND SO WE HAVE WE HAVE MANY CHALLENGES BUT OUR STAFF FOR OUR HIGHLY TRAINED. AND THEY'RE UP TO THE TASK. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION AND I'LL SEE AT THE- DEDICATION CEREMONY FOR THE NEW RESOURCES BUILDING VERY. THEY'VE SAID THEY'RE GOING TO INVITE ALL LIVING FORMER SECRETARIES ON. TO MAKE THAT CUT. YEAH YOU GOT IT EVERYTHING TO MAKE OR BATES GO- THANK YOU THANK YOU YOU MUCH OF FOR YOU SERVICE BUT YOUR- IS SO IMPRESSIVE THAT USED THIS ABOUT IN. EIGHTY AND A- THE WAY YOU LOOKING MASSIVE AND TWO THAT IS THAT RIGHT. THAT TIME IT IS A VERY IMPRESSED RECORD AND I CAN'T IMAGINE SOMEONE MORE QUALIFIED TO OUR- FOR THIS VERY VERY CHEN. TO AS COLLEAGUE MENTIONED- IN MY CAN- WELL TALK ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH ORANGE OVER YEARS WE WERE REQUIRE TO HAVE. NOT PLAN AS PART OF OUR GENERAL. AND THE MY PARTICULAR REGION- WE DO HAVE. I'VE REACHED ON KIND OF THE MATERIALS ETCETERA BUT I'M AM WONDERING IF YOU'LL BE WAITING IN. FINCHER IF ANSWERED A QUESTION IS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WITH. ON THE ISSUES THAT. HOW DID YOU WITH FIRE RISK ESPECIALLY IN ARE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES WHICH COVERS A GOOD DEAL OF THAT THE COASTAL AREA IN MY DISTRICT THAT RUNS FROM LAGUNA BEACH IS ALREADY IN MY DISTRICT THAT AND MEDIALLY SENT. ALL THE WAY DOWN THE COAST AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER PROTECTED OPEN SPACES ALONG THEIR- GETTING THE GOLD OUT TO- TO KIND OF TAKE THE UNDERBRUSH OUT HIS BAND A MAJOR PROJECT IN OUR- ASCEND ORANGE COUNTY AND I'M NOT SURE IF THEY USE THEM IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUT I KNOW THAT WE MAY BETTER EFFECTIVE IN THE LAGUNA BEACH AREA BECAUSE WE HAVE THOSE HORRIFIC FIRES. BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND SO WITH THE DENSIFICATION- OF GOING ON IN TERMS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT IN TRYING TO INCREASE OUR HOUSING STOCK IT SEEMS TO ME WE MIGHT BE APPROACHING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE THE FORK IN THE ROAD ON WHO GETS TO SAY WHAT. ON A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT THAT MIGHT IN FACT. BE A DENSIFICATION AN AREA THAT DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARD OF AN EVACUATION ROUTE AND I CAN GIVE YOU A NUMBER OF THOSE IN MY DISTRICT WILL YOU BE WAITING A ON ON ANY OF THOSE PLANS WILL LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I NEED TO REACH OUT TO YOU OR HAVE YOU ALREADY REACHED. OUT WITH THIS- OUT RICHARD DOING WITH THESE COUNTY SO WE KIND OF HAVE SOME GUIDANCE BEFORE WE GET INTO. LOCAL RESIDENTS- I'M NOT I'M NOT GONNA CALL AND THEN BE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOTTERY THAT THOSE DEVELOP. NOT IT TO PROPERLY- WITH DARK. OUT BUT WE WILL NEED IN OUR OUR YOU SAY OR THE PHONE FROM IS GOING TO WAY AND SAY THAT THAT PROJECT IS GOOD. BUT LOCAL THE SAID NO AND I STAND WITH THEM ON THAT ONE WILL THERE BE ANY SORT OF LOCAL ADJUDICATION ON SOME OF THESE ARE PROPOSALS WHICH- NOT SAYING THEY ARE NECESSARY BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE IN MANY OF THE COUNTY GENERAL PLANS THAT BECAME PART OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS. THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO MEET. SOME OF THE STANDARDS SO THAT JOBS ARE GOING TO A LITTLE THE LACK OF OVER IS BETTER WAY TO SAY THAT'S GOING TO COME FOR. NGUYEN PUSHED TO SHOVE. SO I'M VERY CONCERNED. BOB WE HAVE SOMEONE. YOU KNOW THIRD PARTY ROLE THAT WILL US OUT. KIND OF WORK OUR WAY TO SOME OF THE KINDS THAT CERTAIN WILL DEVELOP. WONDER IF THE FIREMARSHAL WILL HAVE ANYTHING ON ANY ROLE IN OUT. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES THE QUESTION- OUR LAND USE PLANNING PROGRAM AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT PLANNING OFFICIALS BUILDING OFFICIALS. WE WILL REVIEW PROPOSED SUBDIVISION- MAPS AND WE WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT- TYPOGRAPHY FIRE HISTORY- AND REALLY WE'RE DOING THIS IN IN IN. CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEELOPMENT OF THE SAFETY ELEMENTS FOR THEIR LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS FOR THEIR GENERAL PLANS IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT- THAT IS THAT IS OUR ROLE WE DO THIS ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION WE SEND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF FIREBIRD THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION WHO THEN WILL- SEND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LOCALS BUT THIS IS ON THEIR SAFETY ELEMENTS IT'S NOT ON A SUBDIVISION OR PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT BASIS IT'S A REVIEW OF THE SAFETY ELEMENTS OF THE GENERAL PLAN. SOME OF THAT IS THAT IS THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN TO US AND WE WHAT WE WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT IF THEY CHOOSE TO BUILD THE SUBDIVISION THEY WILL HAVE ALL OF THE INFORMATION THEY NEED ABOUT THE HAZARDS. THAT EXIST. THERE IS VERY. AND I WILL KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE GO FORWARD NINE. I SERVED ON THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRES ALREADY FOR MANY YEARS AND WINDOWS VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES. OF CAME FORWARD TO FIVE THERE WAS A LITTLE PUSH BACK BUT THEN IT BECAME SOMETHING THAT WAS SOLVED VERY. THAT WAS REALLY EMBRACED IN OUR COMMUNITY SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S A PLAN OUT THERE AND PEOPLE BEEN FOLLOWING AT THAT TIME. THE LATEST IN TERMS OF ARE YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT NEED FROM OUR HOUSING STOCK- WE HAVE A COUPLE OF BY I WOULD SAY THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE KIND OF BUTTING HEADS HERE AND INSOME OF THE AREAS.

I'M GRATEFUL TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY. I LIKE TO THINK GOVERNOR NEWSOM FOR THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE HE HAS BESTOWED UPON ME WITH THIS APPOINTMENT. AND THE TIME EACH OF YOU TO MEET WITH ME PRIOR TO THIS HEARING. I'M ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE LOVE AND SUPPORT OF MY WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN. I WHICH HAS ALLOWED ME TO PURSUE THIS IMPORTANT ENDEAVOR. MY PASSION AND PERSONAL CONNECTION FOR THIS WORK IS DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE CYCLE OF POVERTY THAT IS PLAGUED MY FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS. IT INFORMS MY WORK AT THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY EVERY SINGLE DAY. WHEN I WORK TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND OTHERS YEARNING TO EXPERIENCE THE DIGNITY OF WORK I THINK ABOUT MY MOTHER'S FIRST WORK EXPERIENCE IS PICKING COTTON AND GRAPES IN THE FIELDS OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. WHEN I WORK WITH EMPLOYERS FROM THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS UNIONS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORKFORCE BOARDS TO CREATE MORE PATHWAYS TO GOOD JOBS I THINK ABOUT MY MOM A SINGLE MOTHER WHO WORKED TO LOW WAGE JOBS TO SUPPORT MY SISTER NOT. WHEN I ENGAGE WITHYOU ENTERING THE JOB MARKET AT THIS MOST DIFFICULT TIME OR HELP THE DEPARTMENT UNDER THE LABOR AGENCY TO WORK SMARTER AND MORE STRATEGICALLY. LEVERAGING PROVEN BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT AND LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PRACTICE IT I REMEMBER THE PERIOD OF TIME WHEN MY FAMILY LIVED IN A SHELTER FOR MOTHERS AND THEIR CHILDREN AND ALTHOUGH OUR RESOURCES WERE INSUFFICIENT. WE WERE DETERMINED TO USE WHAT WE HAD WISELY. WHEN I FOCUSED ON MENTORING AND GUIDANCE COUNSELORS BEING AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE STRUCTURE OF OUR PUBLIC WORKFORCE PROGRAMS I REFLECT ON MY YOUTH EXPERIENCES THAT THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS OF MONTEREY COUNTY. AND I'M REMINDED OF MY DESIRE FOR MENTORING AND ROLE MODELS AND AVOID THE COMMUNITY CENTERED ORGANIZATIONS FEEL FOR SO MANY. THESE ARE THE EXPIRY THAT ARE PREPARE ME FOR THIS ROLE IN ADDITION TO MY EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND OVER THE PAST NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. MY AWARENESS OF NATIONAL AND STATE AFFAIRS REGARDING SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES WERE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND MANY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED WITHIN THE WORKFORCE ECOSYSTEM COMBINED WITH ISSUES OF PAY EQUITY AND INCLUSIVITY. OUR CONCERN IS THAT I ASPIRE TO IN BED IN THE WORKFORCE INITIATIVES THAT I HAVE THE GREAT HONOR TO LEAD. APPLE AGENCY WE HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER SEVEN DEPARTMENTS BOARDS AND PANELS AND MY ROLE AS DEPUTY SECRETARY HAS PRIMARILY BEEN FOCUSED ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. BUILDING PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT EMPLOERS AND EMPLOYEES BUT ALSO DEVELOPING OUR OWN LEADERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKFORCE MORE THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. AND INTEGRATING EQUITY AND STRATEGIC PLANNING AND TO ALL OF OUR WORK. I SEE MY ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE LABOR AGENCIES MISSION TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE THE WELL BEING. OF CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT AND FUTURE WORKFORCE AS PRIMARILY TO PULL BOTH EXTERNALLY. AND INTERNALLY EXTERNALLY I DEVELOP AND LEAD INNOVATIVE INITIATIVES THAT CUT ACROSS OUR VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS BOARDS AND PANELS SUCH AS OUR EFFORTS TO HELP EMPLOYERS BILL BACON POSITIONS. THROUGH ALIGNING EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND TRAINING WITH AN EYE TOWARD EQUITY.

DAD EDT IS READY AND I WOULD ASK OF YOU MAY BE THAT HE WOULD TAKE PROVIDING THAT BILL PASSES IS SIGNED INTO LAW I DO HAVE TO IMPLEMENT. THAT YOU TAKE THE LESSONS THAT ARE LEARNED HERE. AND INTEGRATE THEM WITH THAT PLANNING PROCESS SO THAT THE EQUITY QUESTIONS YOU'RE ACTUALLY PLANNING TO ADDRESS. AHEAD OF TIME AS WELL AS YOUR PLANNING JUST HOW IT WILL BE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO ANSWER THE PHONE TO DO EVERYTHING ELSE. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN THIS TIME IN THE- OF. IT BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE LESSONS YOU LEARN FROM THIS AND- AND HAVE THEM READY FOR THE NEXT TIME THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR INTO. THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. I THANK YOU AND OUR FIRST OF ALL FIRST AND FOREMOST CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NOMINATION FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT A POSITION WITH FAN NO- OUR LABOR LABOR DEPARTMENTS- I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE PAGA ISSUE- WITH JUST A COMMENT- BECAUSE FINDING COURAGE- IN YOUR RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUE THAT HE WOULD TAKE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS BACK FOR DISCUSSION ON BEING THAT IF NOT IN THERE. ARE SPECIFIC JURISDICTION BUT WE KNOW THE- PAGO LAWSUITS DO TARGET THE SMALL MINORITY AND MANY TIMES WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES THEY'RE USED TO SHAKE DOWN THESE BUSINESSES AND I THINK OUR LOOKING AT REFORMS ARE SPECIALLY OF FINANCIAL AS WERE COMING OUT OF THE COLD AND HOPEFULLY FOR BUSINESSES AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A COMMENT I GOT FROM. THIS INDIVIDUAL NOT REALLY A CONSTITUENT BUT IT HEARD ME SPEAK ABOUT TRYING TO GET FROM PARGA ATTENTION TO PAGA AND REFORMS THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED BECAUSE HE SPECIFICALLY MENTIONS THAT IT WAS A VERY. WELL INTENDED LAW WHEN IT WAS INITIATED BUT IT IS GONE YOU KNOW IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF THE HORRIBLE IMPACT IS MAJOR SON AND HE'S I'M JUST GOING TO REVIEW ONE SENTENCE BECAUSE IT IS WHAT CAUGHT MY EYE AND THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION. HE SAYS IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT CLERICAL ERROR SIGN CHECK STUBS AND TIME SHEETS COULD COST MULTIPLES MORE THAN THE FINES AND PENALTIES ASKED BY CAL OSHA FOR A WORKPLACE DEATH IN APPARENTLY HAS EXPERIENCED BOTH. SO WHEN WE SEE THAT KIND OF INEQUITY AND I KNOW YOU ARE VERY VERY HARD ON EQUITY YES CERTAINLY I THINK CRIES OUT FOR A REVIEW AND A POTENTIAL REFORM NOT TO UNDERMINE THE GOOD SIDE OF DEATH TO PROTECT OUR WORK FORCE. BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO PROTECT. OUR BUSINESS SAYS WHO WE'RE TRYING TO COME. AND WHO. MAKE MISTAKE ARE MADE IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE IT LOOKS LIKE HE HIGH A CONSULTANT TO LABOR CONSULTANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT HIS PAYROLL AND HOW HE WAS DISPENSING. OUR HEROES ARE. THE PAGE JACKSON AND THERE WERE A FEW ERRORS I HAVE BEEN NOT HIM NOT LESS THAN THREE OR FOUR MEETINGS WITH MY BUSINESS OWNERS IN MY DISTRICT. HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR THINGS OVER THE TIME I'VE SERVED WHICH IS NOW. ABOUT MY APPROACHING SIX AND HALF YEARS SO PLEASE TAKE THAT UNDER ADVISEMENT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO EQUITY TO DIGGING DEEP INTO THE ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING OUR CERTAINLY OUR BUSINESS. COMMUNITY OUR REGIONALLY AND STATEWIDE BECAUSE OF IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY REALLY NEEDS OF PEOPLE TO COME TO THE TABLE AND FIGURE OUT HOW MODIFICATIONS. WILL PROTECT THE ACT BUT ALSO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO IT. SO WITHOUT ON AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND- IF YOU COULD GET BACK TO ME. R. ON MAY BE TAKING A LOOK AT THIS THING THAT'S VERY SIMPLE WORK TALKING CLERICAL ERRORS THAT WERE UNINTENTIONAL I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. REVIEW THAT CAN GO ON TO ENSURE THAT IT WASN'T GAMING THE SYSTEM THAT IT WAS UNINTENTIONAL I THINK THIS WOULD BE A WONDERFUL MESSAGE. THAT ARE STRUGGLING AND ARE FEARFUL OFTEN FEARFUL. OF THIS COMING THEIR WAY WHEN THEY'RE JUST RECOVERING OR THEY'VE JUST STARTED BUSINESS. AND FRANKLY ARE SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO KNOW THEY HAVE TO HIRE CONSULTANTS TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE SOME OF THE US AND THAT SEEMS TO BE ALMOST A DONOR TO. OUR MINORITY WOMEN OWNERSHIP STARTED BUSINESSES THAT WE ARE ENCOURAGING THROUGH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. SO WITH THAT- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR SERVICE I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH THAT AND HOPE THAT YOU'LL GET BACK TO ME AND- I SHARE SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT FELT LONG OVERDUE.
