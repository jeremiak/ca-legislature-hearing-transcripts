BUT I DO HAVE A COKE I DO HAVE

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:51.736
A QUESTION THAT THE COMMONSENSE

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:54.039
RULE I ACTUALLY CAME IN IT WAS

00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:54.706
A CASE OF VISOR FOR A LONG TIME

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:57.042
AND WE HAD. THE OPPORTUNITY USE

00:27:57.108 --> 00:27:59.310
THIS TO WHAT WE HAVE IN MANY

00:27:59.377 --> 00:28:00.211
THE RULE CARRIES ALMOST TALK

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:01.713
ABOUT THE REALLY SMALL COUNTIES

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.050
ARE TRYING TO CLEAN UP- TELESIS

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:06.451
CITY UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:08.219
I KNOW THERE'S A- POT OF MONEY

00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:10.388
THAT. IS AVAILABLE FOR THAT FOR

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:12.223
EVEN THOSE PROPERTIES THAT.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.725
NOBODY OWNS BASICALLY THEY'VE

00:28:13.792 --> 00:28:15.293
THEY'VE BEEN PUT IN THE SYSTEM

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.761
FOR A LONG TIME AND WE'VE BEEN

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:17.996
TRYING TO CLEAN THOSE UP AND SO

00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:20.365
THAT. THE BILL THE ORIGINAL

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:22.233
BILL WAS TO ALLOW THAT COMMON

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.735
SENSE TO SAY HEY. YOU KNOW

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:25.103
YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE WORK FOR

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.605
THE COST OF. WE HAVE NOT HAVE

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:29.040
TO DO SO MUCH ENVIRONMENTAL

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:30.375
WORK ACTUALLY GETS MORE WORK

00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:31.810
DONE AND THAT WAS THE REASON

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:33.411
THAT THERE WAS A COMMON SENSE

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:35.013
APPROACH TO IT RIGHT THAT KATE.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.014
WOULD NOT DISPENSED MUCH MONEY

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:37.248
ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:38.116
GOING ON WE CAN JUST GO CLEAN

00:28:38.183 --> 00:28:41.453
IT UP. SO IS THERE IS THERE. I

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:43.054
WOULD I WOULD READ THROUGH

00:28:43.121 --> 00:28:44.355
EVERYTHING I HAD AVAILABLE TO

00:28:44.422 --> 00:28:46.224
ME- I'M ASSUMING A LOT OF THOSE

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:47.158
PROJECTS HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:48.593
WAY NOW AND WE'VE DONE. A LOT

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.895
OF WORK ON THOSE OVER THE YEARS

00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:52.430
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. SOMETIME IS

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:54.699
THERE IS A TWO SIX ON LIKE HOW

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:55.300
MUCH IS LEFT OUT THERE THAT WE

00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:56.167
DON'T KNOW ABOUT PRETTY MUCH

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:57.368
MOST COUNTIES KNOW WHERE THEY

00:28:57.435 --> 00:28:59.170
HAVE BROWN FIELDS. WHERE THEY

00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:01.005
HAVE. YOU KNOW THERE WAS SOME

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:02.040
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT NOW THE

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:03.541
LAWS CHANGE AND IT'S BECAME

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:04.509
TOXIC THAT THEY WERE AWARE

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:05.643
BEFORE SO DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.912
INFORMATION ON THAT BECAUSE- I

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:09.013
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.782
NOT. LEAVING SITES THAT WE

00:29:10.849 --> 00:29:14.052
COULD GO CLEAN UP. IN THERE WAS

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:17.288
THAT COST DIFFERENTIAL IN THEIR.

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:20.258
THANK YOU FOR. NOT SURE WHERE

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:21.860
WE GO THANK YOU THOSE ARE

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:24.729
EXCELLENT POINTS THE- THE

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:28.099
ORIGINAL BILL. WAS REALLY SET

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:29.901
OUT TO IDENTIFY SOMETHING HAD

00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:31.136
NEVER BEEN IDENTIFIED BEFORE

00:29:31.202 --> 00:29:32.704
WHICH IS WHERE OUR THEIR

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.472
UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS THAT

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:35.840
MAY OR MAY NOT BE LEAKING TO

00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:37.842
STE WHERE ARE THEY- SUPPOSED TO

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:39.177
THE NEED TO BE. MAPPED AND

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:41.846
IDENTIFIED THUS THE NAME LIST

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:44.048
OR THE TURN LIST RIGHTS OF THIS

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:44.849
LISTING WHAT'S THE LISTING CAME

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:47.719
OF COURSE- THEN THE WHOLE

00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:50.255
INDUSTRY DEVELOPED IN- STATE

00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:53.158
FUNDING. CAME ABOUT TO ASSIST

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:54.959
IN CLEANING UP ANY OF THOSE AT

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:58.396
IN FACT HAD BEEN LEAKING- THAT

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:00.064
PROCESS GOES ON I DON'T KNOW

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:02.167
PRECISELY HOW MANY REMAIN HOW

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:03.801
MANY HAVE BEEN CLOSE OVER THE

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:04.435
YEARS BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT A GOOD

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:06.070
WORK HAS BEEN DONE. HOW MANY

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:07.872
WOULD REMAIN OPEN TO THIS DAY

00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:09.274
WE WOULD PROBABLY DEPEND PART

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.075
ON HOW HOW RECENTLY THEY WERE

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:12.043
DISCOVERED IN ADDED TO THE

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:16.581
LIST- THAT SAID- THE ISSUE ERE

00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:19.951
IS THAT IT'S SORT OF A- IT'S

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:22.420
SORT OF A- THERE'S LESS.

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.322
LOOPHOLE IF YOU WILL I'M NOT

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:28.893
SURE IF YOU KNOW IT IT'S AT ALL

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.396
OF FAIR LOOPHOLE BUT- WHERE-

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:32.864
THE COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION WHICH

00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:34.832
REALLY ISN'T ABOUT COMMON SENSE

00:30:34.899 --> 00:30:36.367
IN THE LATE LAYPERSON'S TERMS

00:30:36.434 --> 00:30:37.869
ABOUT TO TELL THEM APART THAT

00:30:37.936 --> 00:30:39.070
SAYS WHEN THERE'S NO FURTHER

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:41.539
POSSIBILITY. OF IN THIS CASE

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:44.142
CONTAMINATION THEN GO AHEAD AND

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:45.210
CLOSE AT A LOCAL AGENCY CAN

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:47.612
CLOSE IT- THAT IS

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.781
EXTRAORDINARILY- IN

00:30:49.847 --> 00:30:53.284
CONTRADICTION. TO DTS SEE

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.919
SITTING ON THAT SITE ST THERE

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:58.256
STILL IS. HAZARDOUS WASTE ON

00:30:58.323 --> 00:30:59.424
THE SITE THAT'S WHY WE HAVEN'T

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.659
CLOSED SO IF THE TNC IS SAYING

00:31:01.726 --> 00:31:04.562
WE HAVE NOTYET- DEAN THIS.

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:06.197
SITE READY FOR CLOSURE BECAUSE

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:08.132
OF THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.835
UNDERGROUND. BUT A LOCAL AGENCY

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:12.503
SHOULD BE COMING ALONG.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.205
OVERRIDING ON THE BASIS THAT

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:15.907
THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY THAT

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:18.443
THERE'S HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SO.

00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:19.277
THIS IS JUST TRYING TO. STOP

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:21.846
THAT FROM HAPPENING DOES A

00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:22.447
REMOTE REQUIRE OF COURSE THAT

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:24.849
IS A FULL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

00:31:24.916 --> 00:31:25.783
REPORT BE DONE THAT'S AS WE ALL

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.318
KNOW FROM OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:30.154
DAYS- AND A SIMPLE NEGATIVE

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:31.556
DECLARATION COULD. COULD BE

00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:32.790
USED BUT AT LEAST YOU STILL

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:34.359
HAVE YOU THEN HELP THE PUBLIC

00:31:34.425 --> 00:31:35.326
HEARING PROCESS PEOPLE WERE

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:37.061
NOTIFIED ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:38.963
SUPPORT COULD TESTIFY. THIS

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.965
THIS COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION IS

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:43.001
ESSENTIALLY HE BATES ALL OF

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:43.935
THAT THERE'S NO PUBLIC INPUT

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:45.570
THERE'S NO PUBLIC PROCESS IT IS

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:47.905
THE DETERMINATION. SO WE'RE

00:31:47.972 --> 00:31:49.240
TRYING TO STOP THAT FROM

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:51.075
HAPPENING I DO THINK IN THE

00:31:51.142 --> 00:31:53.378
FUTURE- SO LEGISLATION PROBABLY

00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:55.046
SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO TRY TO

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:57.115
EXPEDITE THE CLOSURE OF THOSE

00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:58.116

WITH- THE- THE PROCESS IN A

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.998
BACK HANDED WAY IT SHOULD BE

00:32:14.065 --> 00:32:16.301
DONE BY LEGISLATING PERHAPS

WHAT THE NEW STANDARDS ARE IN

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:18.836
TERMS OF CLOSURE. THIS BILL

00:32:18.903 --> 00:32:20.972

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:56.118
FARMER. WE THIS ISN'T THIS IS

01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:58.687
ACT THIS IS AGRICULTURE ME I

01:15:58.754 --> 01:15:59.621
KNOW YOU REPRESENT A DISTRICT

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:02.024
WHAT. WHAT I WANT TO GROW

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:03.091
WHATEVER I WANT TO GO I DON'T

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:04.793
HAVE TO DO SECRET WHY CAN'T WE

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:05.794
JUST GOING TO THE REGIONAL

01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:09.431
LIKE. FARM RULES I KNOW THERE I

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:11.099
KNOW THAT THERE'S PROCESS

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:12.467
SEEING IN THAT BUT FOR THE FOR

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:13.936
THE ACTUAL GROW PART OF IT THAT

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:14.970
THEY HAVE TO BE DO THE SAME

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:17.105
THING THAT EVERY OTHER

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:18.440
AGRICULTURE. COMMUNITY WOULD DO.

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:19.708
IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THE LOCAL

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:22.811
UP THERE DOING SEQUEL. BUT I

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:24.346
DON'T HAVE TO DO SECRETIVE. TO

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.516
GROW. THE THINGS I'M GROWING

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:28.750
WHAT WHAT WHAT WHERE'S THE

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:30.819
DISCONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:33.021
AGRICULTURE DOES AND WHAT

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:36.425
CANNABIS IS DOING. I THINK

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:37.893
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION THE

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.394
CHALLENGES IS THIS IS WHAT WAS

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:43.999
SET UP IN THE- IN THE ORIGINAL-

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:46.902
BALLOT MEASURE THAT WAS PASSED.

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:49.004
AND SO AND SO IT WAS PART OF

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:50.806
THAT PART OF THE PROCESS IS

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.140
THAT WE GET IN ANALYSIS AND

01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:55.978
PARTIALLY I BELIEVE. BECAUSE

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.279
PEOPLE THAT WERE DOING THE E.

01:16:57.346 --> 01:16:58.981
LOCAL GROWS WERE DOING IT IN A

01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:01.016
WAY THAT ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:03.118
THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT HAD

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:04.853
NO REGARD FOR GOOD GOOD FARMING

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.688
PRACTICES THEY WEREN'T.

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:09.291
NECESSARILY WELL IT WAS IN A

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:10.359
LEGAL PRODUCT SO THEY DID IT

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:11.793
WHEREVER THEY COULD DO IT ADD

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:15.130
UP ALTERED STREAM BEDS. DID YOU

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:17.065
KNOW ALL KINDS OF PESTICIDES

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:19.267
APPLICATION AND SOIL MEANT AND

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:20.502
ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT WERE

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:21.703
GOOD. I THINK THAT'S A

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:22.871
CHALLENGE WELL I'M I'M TELLING

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:24.306
YOU THAT THAT'S HAPPENING ON

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:26.174
STEROIDS IN MOST OF MY

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:28.443
DISTRICT. THE NORMAL FARMER

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:29.644
THIS DOWNSTREAM FROM WHOSE

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:31.046
LOSSES WATER IT'S GETTING

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:32.080
CONTAMINATED THEY'RE KILLING

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.082
FISH IS HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.684
FISH AND WILDLIFE EVERY TIME HE

01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:37.252
DOES SOMETHING FOR DIVERSION.

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:39.054
GOING AFTER HIM AND THE POT

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:40.088
GROWER UP STRICTER WE'RE GONNA

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:41.656
HAVE A CIVIL WAR OUT THERE

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:43.158
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO COME UP

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:45.160
WITH SOME BETTER PROCESS. THAN

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:46.728
WHAT WE HAVE NOW BECAUSE THE

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:48.864
ILLEGAL PEOPLE ARE. JUST

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.165
RUNNING RAMPANT AND PEOPLE WHO

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:51.933
ARE TRYING TO FORM LEGALLY ARE

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.636
GETTING HAMMERED BY DF THE

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:55.504
DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE IN

01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:57.472
UNIT FOR A WATER QUALITY AND

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:59.307
ALL THOSE THINGS SO. WHAT WE

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:00.409
NEED TO GET IT UNDER THE GUISE

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:01.877
AYE AYE GIVE SUMMIT COULD I CAN

01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:03.979
LOOK AT PROP FIFTY FOUR OR

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:05.414
SIXTY FOUR WHICH OF WHICH NINE

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.484
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S.

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:10.085
ACTUALLY SAID BECAUSE IT SEEMS

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:10.886
LIKE TO ME. WE SHOULD ALLOW IT.

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.054
IT TO BE FARM ANY OTHER

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.555
COMMODITIES FORMED. AND

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:15.357
REGULATED THE SAME AS WELL

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:16.691
EXCEPT FOR THE DISTRIBUTION

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:17.726
SIDE OF IT WHICH WOULD THEN

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:19.161
WOULD BE. SOMETHING LIKE WE

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:21.897
HAVE WITH A. B. C. WITH ALCOHOL

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:24.366

KNOW THE UFC RIGHT THIS IS SET

01:18:29.404 --> 01:18:31.206
OUT IN SIXTY FOUR. I THINK WAS

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:32.741
DONE IN A TIME WHEN THE A THIS

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.676
WAS A BITTERLY BRAND NEW

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:35.277
INDUSTRY WAS STILL ILLEGAL AT

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:37.546
THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THERE'S NO

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:39.314
QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO DO A

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.083
DEEP DIVE INTO THIS SPACE AND

01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:42.884
DECIDE WHAT KINDS OF CANNABIS

01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:44.653
RELATED PROJECTS. MERIT C. CORE

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:46.388
VIEW AND WENT DOWN I MEAN

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:47.222
THERE'S A LOT A LITTLE POT

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:49.691
SHOPS THAT JUST OPENED UP- FOR

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:51.426

SHOULD BE SUBSEA QUEST. ARE YOU

BROUGHT UP SOME GREAT CONCERNS

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:57.799
THE OTHER COURSE ISSUE THAT WE

01:18:57.866 --> 01:18:59.601
HAVE HERE IS THAT THE REALLY

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:02.170
BAD ACTORS. ARE TYPICALLY UNDER

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:03.538
THE UNDER THE RADAR THE

01:19:03.605 --> 01:19:04.773
OPERATING UNDERGROUND AND NOT

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.009
COMPLYING WITH THE SYSTEM AND

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:08.643
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY.

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:09.444
I MEAN IT IS ONE OF THE YEAH

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:10.712
WE'VE DELVED INTO THIS ISSUE

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:11.646
WHICH IS NOT IN A- POLICY

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:13.014
EXPERTISE FOR ME BUT- IN THE-

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:16.184
CONTEXT OF THIS BILL- YOU YOU

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.619

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:20.489
PUBLIC POLICY. CONUNDRUM AS YOU

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:23.592
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PUT A

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:24.226
REGULATORY SYSTEM IN PLACE IT'S

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:27.095
ACTUALLY GOING TO- ENCOURAGED

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:29.097
THE BEST BEHAVIOR AND NOT. AND

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:30.565
NOT PUSH PEOPLE ON THE GROUND I

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:31.199
THINK YOU HEARD THAT WITH SOME

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:32.534
OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:33.635
A LITTLE EARLIER I KNOW THIS IS

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:35.203
THE ISSUE WE HAVE WITH TAXATION

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:37.372
AND JUST THAT THE- THE BLACK

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:38.974
MARKET IN THIS IN THIS AREA IN

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.710
GENERAL SO- THIS IS A- THIS IS

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:43.445
A BILL THAT IS GOOD. THERE IS

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:44.546
ABSOLUTELY HILL FOR CAN

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:46.348
PROGRESS I DON'T THINK I DON'T

CLAIMED THE BUSINESS BAKED AT

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:52.787
THIS POINT. YOU KNOW. WE'VE GOT

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:54.623
A LOT OF DIFFERENT. FOLKS WHO

01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:55.624
ARE PRESERVING THIS

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:57.359
CONVERSATION LABOR.

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:59.828
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY- SMALL

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:03.231
GROWERS BIG GROWERS- SMALL AND

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:07.602
LARGE- RETAIL. OUR CITIES BREAK

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:09.171
IS A LOT OF CITIES HAVE NOW

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:11.072
COME UP WITH THEIR OWN. FIVE

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:13.074
REGULATORY AS A PROVISIONAL

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:14.943
LICENSE SYSTEMS AND SOME OF

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:15.744
THEM ONCE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:19.347
SEEK THOSE LICENSES PLAY OUT-

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:23.418
YOU KNOW I WOULD SO I'M HAPPY

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:24.686
TO SUPPORT THE BILL TO DATE

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:25.854
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:27.889
AUTHOR IS VERY COMMITTED TO

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:28.523
WORKING WITH ALL THE

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:30.926
STAKEHOLDERS AND TO SEE IF WE

CAN AND CAN'T- COME UP ITH

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:33.028
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:34.129
LOGICAL BUT I DON'T THINK

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:36.531
ANYBODY THINKS OF THIS BILL IS-

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:37.599
READY TO. TO MOVE TO THE

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:39.234
GOVERNOR'S DESK AT THIS POINT

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:40.168
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:43.371

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:46.408
WORK BEYOND THIS BILL- YOU KNOW

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:47.809
ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS I HEAR

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:48.410
FROM SOME OF THE OPPONENTS IS

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:50.812
THAT WELL LET'S. EXTEND OUT THE

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:52.147
PROVISIONAL LICENSE PROGRAM FOR

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:54.149
A PERIOD OF TIME IT'S LESS THAN

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:56.785
SIX YEARS NOT BECAUSE- THEY

01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:58.587
ARE. ENORMOUS SEQUEL ACOLYTES

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:00.155
OF BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY WANT

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:01.356
TO HAVE A BROADER REVIEW OF THE

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:03.792
EXTENT TO WHICH WERE APPLYING

THE APPLICATION SEQUIN THIS

01:21:13.735 --> 01:21:15.904
SPACE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN-

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:17.839
WITH. THE CONSTRUCTION OF A-

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:19.908

PROGRAM- BY THINK. ONE OF THE

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:36.951
THINGS IT'S BECOME SO

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:38.285
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR TO ME AS I'VE

01:37:38.352 --> 01:37:39.954
GOTTEN DEEPER INTO THIS POLICY

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:42.423
MAKING AREA- CURBSIDE.

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:45.359
CONTAMINATION ISSUES. THE BIG

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:47.294
ISSUE. ARE YOU KNOW. WE'RE

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:48.495
SINGLE STREAMING EVERYTHING

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:51.465
GLASS AB. BIZ BOTH IT WILL IT

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:53.367
BOTH. GETS CONTAMINATED BY

01:37:53.434 --> 01:37:54.902
IT'S- IT'S HARDER TO RECYCLE

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:55.869
GLASS GIVEN THE CURRENT

01:37:55.936 --> 01:37:57.705
SITUATION. WITH WITH SINGLE

01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:59.306
STREAMING AND IT ALSO THE GLASS

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:00.774
WHEN IT BREAKS UP AND UP

01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:01.909
CONTAMINATING IN FACT BECOMING

01:38:01.976 --> 01:38:05.846
A DANGER. TO BE HONEST- WITHOUT

01:38:05.913 --> 01:38:06.780
WITH OTHER RECYCLABLE MATERIALS.

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:07.915
SO I'M I'M REALLY HOPEFUL THAT

01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:09.350
YOUR BILL WILL HELP TO START

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:10.217
THE CONVERSATION ON HOW TO FIX

01:38:10.284 --> 01:38:12.820
THAT. NOW A WE SEE EVEN SEE

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:13.721
FROM THE COMMENTS OF THE BIG

01:38:13.787 --> 01:38:14.722
BILL AND YET THERE DOESN'T SEEM

01:38:14.788 --> 01:38:15.422
TOBE A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER

01:38:15.489 --> 01:38:17.825
ENGAGEMENT YET I THINKS PEOPLE

01:38:17.891 --> 01:38:18.692
STILL TRY TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT

01:38:18.759 --> 01:38:21.161
THE BILL DOES. STAFFREPORT.

01:38:21.228 --> 01:38:22.896
TALKS ABOUT HOW THERE'S LOTS.

01:38:22.963 --> 01:38:24.298
OF WORK TO BE DONE ON THE BILL

01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:26.734
LOTS OF QUESTIONS. I THINK

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.869
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES- YOU

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:29.670
KNOW WE WOULD ASK THE AUTOR TO

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:31.171
CONSIDER MAKING THE BILL IT TO

01:38:31.238 --> 01:38:32.806
YOUR BILL- TO GIVE THE AUTHOR

01:38:32.873 --> 01:38:34.408
MORE TIME TO WORK THINGS OUT

01:38:34.475 --> 01:38:34.808
ENGAGE WITH A VERY

01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:36.543
STAKEHOLDERS. AND OF COURSE I

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:38.012
THINK NOT ONLY IS IT POSSIBLE

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:39.546
IT'S PERHAPS LIKELY THAT IT

01:38:39.613 --> 01:38:42.383
WILL BE A TO YOUR BILL- JUST

01:38:42.449 --> 01:38:43.050
GIVEN THE ENORMITY OF THE

01:38:43.117 --> 01:38:44.551
ISSUES YOU'RE TRYING TO. DEAL

01:38:44.618 --> 01:38:46.820
WITH AND HOW IT INTERPLAY'S

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:47.288
WITH OTHER WORK THAT'S

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:49.156
HAPPENING THAT BEING SAID. YOUR

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:49.957
BREAK YOU'RE BRINGING UP

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:51.492
IMPORTANT IMPORTANT ISSUES AND

01:38:51.558 --> 01:38:52.226
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

01:38:52.293 --> 01:38:54.295
REASON WHY- IF THE STARS ALIGN

01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:55.896
WE CAN'T GET MEANINGFUL POLICY

01:38:55.963 --> 01:38:59.300
TOGETHER EVEN THIS YEAR- IN

01:38:59.366 --> 01:39:00.968
THIS IN THIS SPACE. I'M NOT I

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:02.236
ALSO IMAGINE IT IS MORE THE

01:39:02.303 --> 01:39:03.837
PROVISIONS GET FLUSHED OUT

01:39:03.904 --> 01:39:04.305
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MORE

01:39:04.371 --> 01:39:06.307
STAKEHOLDERS. WAY AND BECOME

01:39:06.373 --> 01:39:08.909
MORE. INVOLVED OBVIOUSLY THERE

01:39:08.976 --> 01:39:10.444
IS ENORMOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:39:10.511 --> 01:39:11.912

THANK YOU- CHAIR- FOR THE

01:58:09.849 --> 01:58:11.384

ANALYSIS WAS- WAS VERY GOOD AND

01:58:15.455 --> 01:58:19.158
I. SO MY COMMENTS AND THEN I

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:22.929
MAY HAVE A QUESTION IS. D. I

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:25.565
THINK THE ANALYSIS- GIVES A

01:58:25.631 --> 01:58:30.069
GOOD BACKGROUND ON. THE. THE

01:58:30.136 --> 01:58:31.838
CARD IS THE STATE OF OUR TO

01:58:31.904 --> 01:58:33.439
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THE ROLE

01:58:33.506 --> 01:58:35.208
THAT HYDROGEN COULD PLAY BUT

01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:37.743
ALSO THE FACT THAT STILL

01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:40.513
HYDROGEN IS RIGHT NOW AS THE

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:42.515
OPPOSITION HAS RAISED BEING

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:44.784
PRODUCED- THROUGH FOSSIL FUEL

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:46.486
SO IT'S MORE WHAT WE CALL GRADE

01:58:46.552 --> 01:58:50.690
HYDROGEN HOWEVER THE NOTICES

01:58:50.756 --> 01:58:52.525
POINTS OUT THAT WE HAVE THE- WE

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:55.394
ARE MOVING. TOWARDS A

01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:57.330
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE WOULD

01:58:57.396 --> 01:59:00.366
HAVE MUCH GREATER CAPACITY. TO

01:59:00.433 --> 01:59:02.635
PRODUCE HYDROGEN FROM NON

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:06.472
FOSSIL SOURCES WHICH OF COURSE.

01:59:06.539 --> 01:59:08.841
WOOD NOT ONLY FROM A LIFE CYCLE

01:59:08.908 --> 01:59:11.177
POINT OF VIEW MAKE THAT ENERGY

01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:13.045
SOURCE FUEL HAVE WHAT HAVE YOU

01:59:13.112 --> 01:59:14.580
BECAUSE THEY BENEFIT OF

01:59:14.647 --> 01:59:15.581
HYDROGEN IS THAT IT CAN BE

01:59:15.648 --> 01:59:17.583
APPLIED IN MANY DIFFERENT IT'S

01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:20.820
VERY VERSATILE- ENERGY SOURCE.

01:59:20.887 --> 01:59:22.622
BUT THE BENEFIT BEING THAT NOT

01:59:22.688 --> 01:59:24.857
ONLY WOULD IT HAVE SIGNIFICANT

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:27.560
IMPACT IN TERMS OF GREENHOUSE

01:59:27.627 --> 01:59:28.694
GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION BUT

01:59:28.761 --> 01:59:30.830
ALSO HELPING US MOVE OFF OF

01:59:30.897 --> 01:59:32.832
DIESEL AND DUST DEALING WITH

01:59:32.899 --> 01:59:34.734
ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AIR

01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:37.837
POLLUTING HEALTH IMPACTED AIR

01:59:37.904 --> 01:59:39.105
POLLUTING SOURCES THAT WE HAVE.

01:59:39.171 --> 01:59:41.307
AND NOW LIKE ANYTHING DEVIL'S

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:43.309
IN THE DETAILS. IT WERE RIGHT

01:59:43.376 --> 01:59:46.045
NOW. NOT FULLY AT THE PLACE

01:59:46.112 --> 01:59:50.349
WHERE WE HAVE. THAT ADVANTAGE

01:59:50.416 --> 01:59:53.152
AND IT COST EFFECTIVE THE GREEN

01:59:53.219 --> 01:59:57.924
HYDROGEN HOWEVER. IF WE BY WELL

01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:59.725
I'LL PUT IN THE POSITIVE WAY

01:59:59.792 --> 02:00:01.594
BYE OUR SENDING WITH THE STATE

02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:03.462
OF CALIFORNIA THE RIGHT MARKET

02:00:03.529 --> 02:00:06.766
SIGNALS WE CAN HELP STIMULATE

02:00:06.832 --> 02:00:08.768
AND JUMP START THAT HAPPENING

02:00:08.834 --> 02:00:10.970
AND THAT'S AND OF COURSE THE

02:00:11.037 --> 02:00:12.171
ALL ALL OF THEM THE MARKET

02:00:12.238 --> 02:00:13.606
SIGNALS THEY HAVE TO BE

02:00:13.673 --> 02:00:14.774
MULTIPLE ONCE THE

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.642
INFRASTRUCTURE HAS TO BE THERE

02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:18.477
TOO SO THAT'S A MARKET SIGNAL.

02:00:18.544 --> 02:00:19.946
AS WELL AS THE OTHER MARKET

02:00:20.012 --> 02:00:21.747
SIGNALS THAT WE THAT WE THE

02:00:21.814 --> 02:00:23.115
STATE CALIFORNIA SEE A REAL

02:00:23.182 --> 02:00:27.486
ROLE FOR THIS FUEL SOURCE ENACT

02:00:27.553 --> 02:00:29.622
THOSE VARIOUS MARKET SIGNALS

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:31.490
CAN HOPEFULLY A LINE SO THAT

02:00:31.557 --> 02:00:33.092
THE INVESTOR COMMUNITY AND THE

02:00:33.159 --> 02:00:34.026
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

02:00:34.093 --> 02:00:36.596
INVESTOR AND- AN ENTREPRENEUR

02:00:36.662 --> 02:00:40.466
COMMUNITY PUTS THESE THINGS

02:00:40.533 --> 02:00:41.834
TOGETHER. NOW THE- OPPOSITION

02:00:41.901 --> 02:00:44.070
RAISING THAT YOU KNOW WE MAY BE

02:00:44.136 --> 02:00:47.440
JUMPING TO FAST IN AND BY DOING

02:00:47.506 --> 02:00:50.843
SO WE WOULD END UP- SUPPORTING

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:54.380
OR OR MOVING TOWARDS MORE OF

02:00:54.447 --> 02:00:56.349
THIS FOSSIL FUEL BASED HYDROGEN.

02:00:56.415 --> 02:00:57.683
AND PEAK BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:59.018
RAISING THE DIFFERENCE IN THE

02:00:59.085 --> 02:01:00.753
ANALYSIS SHOWS IT IN PRICE

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:03.155
BETWEEN SAY THE ELECTROLYTIC

02:01:03.222 --> 02:01:04.824
PRODUCED HYDROGEN VERSUS THE

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:07.360
GREAT HYDROGEN. NOW THOSE WERE

02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:09.095
VERY COMPARABLE ARGUMENTS THAT

02:01:09.161 --> 02:01:11.597
WE HEARD WHEN FOR EXAMPLE I

02:01:11.664 --> 02:01:12.665
CARRIED THE BILL ON ENERGY

02:01:12.732 --> 02:01:15.201
STORAGE MANDATE WHICH WAS BACK

02:01:15.267 --> 02:01:17.470
IN TWENTY TEN. AND AT THAT

02:01:17.536 --> 02:01:19.505
POINT EVERYONE SET OUT THIS IS

02:01:19.572 --> 02:01:22.341
IMPOSSIBLE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE

02:01:22.408 --> 02:01:23.809
THERE WILL BE NO THERE WE DON'T

02:01:23.876 --> 02:01:24.944
HAVE THE APPROPRIATE

02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:27.346
TECHNOLOGIES. THANKS AND IT

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:31.651
COULD BE FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS.

02:01:31.717 --> 02:01:33.185
CALIFORNIA IS NOW THE LEADER IN

02:01:33.252 --> 02:01:34.587
ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY

02:01:34.654 --> 02:01:35.755
ENERGY STORAGE IS THE COMPLETE

02:01:35.821 --> 02:01:38.457
GAME CHANGER THE PRICES GONE

02:01:38.524 --> 02:01:41.594
DOWN BY A PHENOMENAL. AND HAD

02:01:41.661 --> 02:01:42.628
WE NOT ACTED THAT MAY NOT HAVE

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:44.997
HAPPENED SO THESE PREDICTIONS

02:01:45.064 --> 02:01:46.232
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET

02:01:46.298 --> 02:01:48.100
SOMEWHERE TO FIFTEEN YEARS YEAH

02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:49.669
IF WE DON'T. IF WE DON'T SEND

02:01:49.735 --> 02:01:53.706
ANY SIGNALS WE MIGHT NOT GET

02:01:53.773 --> 02:01:55.708
THESE CRISES THAT WE ARE FACING

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:57.510
BOTH THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF AIR

02:01:57.576 --> 02:01:58.711
POLLUTION AND THE CLIMATE

02:01:58.778 --> 02:02:00.413
CRISIS ARE SO SERIOUS THAT WE

02:02:00.479 --> 02:02:02.948
NEED TO SEND THE RIGHT. MARKET

02:02:03.015 --> 02:02:08.054
SIGNALS SO- I. THE ANALYSIS

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:10.256
DIDN'T NECESSARILY DETAIL ANY

02:02:10.322 --> 02:02:11.957
AMENDMENTS SO I GUESS SORRY I

02:02:12.024 --> 02:02:13.626
WOULD DIRECT THIS THE CHAIR I

02:02:13.693 --> 02:02:16.429
WANT TO SEE THE CHAIR IF YOU

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:21.867
IT'S CONSTRUCTED NOW. IS GOING

02:02:21.934 --> 02:02:24.904
TO SEND THOSE SIGNALS. BUT AND

02:02:24.970 --> 02:02:26.872
NOT AS I INTERPRETED THAT WE

02:02:26.939 --> 02:02:28.708
HAVE WE'RE FEELING. WE ARE

02:02:28.774 --> 02:02:30.810
FEELING THAT IT IS IN GOOD

02:02:30.876 --> 02:02:32.078
ENOUGH SHAPE TO SEND THOSE

02:02:32.144 --> 02:02:34.714
SIGNALS WITHOUT HAVING TO BE A

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:36.415
NEGATIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE

02:02:36.482 --> 02:02:39.085
OF. OF FLOODING THE MARKET WITH

02:02:39.151 --> 02:02:42.254
GREAT HYDROGEN. ON AND I COULD

02:02:42.321 --> 02:02:44.523
ASK THE AUTHOR BUT I GUESS I'M

02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:46.559

ORIGINALLY THERE WERE NO

02:02:59.205 --> 02:03:01.440
STIPULATIONS IN THE BILL. ABOUT

02:03:01.507 --> 02:03:02.341
WHERE THE HAD ORIGINALLY COME

02:03:02.408 --> 02:03:04.310
FROM THE SOURCING- AND THEN

02:03:04.376 --> 02:03:07.546
OVER AN ENERGY- THEY PUT IN

02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:21.894
IT TIMES BETTER FROM EMISSIONS

02:03:21.961 --> 02:03:23.429
PERSPECTIVE AND YOU KNOW THE IS

02:03:23.496 --> 02:03:25.197

THERE FOR REQUIRING THAT X.

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:33.005
PERCENTAGE OF. OF THE HYDROGEN.

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:34.673
UNIT DELIVERED TO BE RENEWABLE

02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:38.444
WE YOU KNOW. SO WE'VE BEEN

KNOW DOT HAS BEEN BEEN VERY

02:03:44.483 --> 02:03:45.718
MINIMAL CONVERSATION SO FAR-

02:03:45.785 --> 02:03:49.388
AND- TO IS IT THERE WE HAVEN'T

02:03:49.455 --> 02:03:51.223
REALLY LANDED ON ONE WE HAVEN'T

02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:53.893
LANDED OKAY EXACTLY WHICH YET-

02:03:53.959 --> 02:03:55.861

CERTAINLY THE WAY WAS INITIALLY

02:04:08.741 --> 02:04:10.042
FRAME THAT EVEN IN ITS CURRENT

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:11.911
FORM I DON'T THINK GOES FAR

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:13.979
AND- YOU FAR ENOUGH TO ADDRESS

02:04:14.046 --> 02:04:16.115

WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE.

02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:25.324
THAT IS THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE

02:04:25.391 --> 02:04:26.225
WITH DODD BILL TO LIKE WE GOT

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:27.293
THESE DIFFERENT VEHICLES

02:04:27.359 --> 02:04:29.195
MILLION HOW DO WE MARRY THEM

02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:31.297
AND ENSURE THAT THEIR- IN. THE

02:04:31.363 --> 02:04:32.231
MOVING FORWARD IN THE SAME

02:04:32.298 --> 02:04:34.667
SPIRIT SO I. ASSOCIATE MYSELF

02:04:34.733 --> 02:04:36.502
WITH THE COMMENTS AND I GUESS I

02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:39.038
JUST WANT TO. SAY TO THE AUTHOR

02:04:39.104 --> 02:04:40.472
THAT TIME IF WE DO MOVE IT OUT

02:04:40.539 --> 02:04:41.540
OF COMMITTEE TODAY THIS IS

02:04:41.607 --> 02:04:43.776
GOING TO BE. AN IMMENSELY

02:04:43.843 --> 02:04:45.211
IMPORTANT. ISSUE FOR US TO

02:04:45.277 --> 02:04:48.814
RESOLVE BEFORE. WE HAVE. YOU

02:04:48.881 --> 02:04:50.516
KNOW THE BEFORE WE RECOMMEND IT

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:52.785
MOVING TO THE FLOOR AND- MOVING

02:04:52.852 --> 02:04:55.754
ALONG WILL I- AM I APPRECIATE

02:04:55.821 --> 02:04:58.691
THAT AND- I REALIZED I REACHED

02:04:58.757 --> 02:05:01.227
IT BUT I. AT THE PROPER TIME

02:05:01.293 --> 02:05:03.229
I'M READY TO MOVE THE BILL AND

02:05:03.295 --> 02:05:06.532
I GUESS I. AS MUCH AS I RAISE

02:05:06.599 --> 02:05:08.300
THOSE CONCERNS I ALSO WANT TO

02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:12.204
MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T. PUT

02:05:12.271 --> 02:05:13.639
THERE WE HEARD IN SIMILAR THE

02:05:13.706 --> 02:05:15.441
BILL THAT WE HEARD BEFORE AND

02:05:15.507 --> 02:05:17.376
CANNABIS THAT WE DON'T PUT IN

02:05:17.443 --> 02:05:21.380
SUCH RIGID. SAY AMENDMENTS THAT

02:05:21.447 --> 02:05:23.549
WE CALL FOR LACK OF A BETTER

02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:24.483
TERM CUT OUR NOSE OFF TO SPITE

02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:27.086
OUR FACE AND THAT PERHAPS IT IS

02:05:27.152 --> 02:05:29.889
MORE. INTENT LANGUAGE LIKE

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:32.858
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY- MUCH OF THIS

02:05:32.925 --> 02:05:34.226
WOULD STILL BE IN THE HANDS OF

02:05:34.293 --> 02:05:36.128
OUR VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES

02:05:36.195 --> 02:05:37.263
YOU KNOW MAYBE THE INTENT

02:05:37.329 --> 02:05:38.430
LANGUAGE OF THAT YOU KNOW TO

02:05:38.497 --> 02:05:42.501
HELP TO WHATEVER- INVESTMENTS

02:05:42.568 --> 02:05:44.103
ARE MADE A REGULATIONS THAT.

02:05:44.169 --> 02:05:48.107
THE FACTOR OR DO THEIR BEST TO-

02:05:48.173 --> 02:05:52.544
TO- TO MIRROR OUR OTHER

02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:54.914
STATUTORY GOALS RIGHT IN THAT

02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:57.149
WAY. THE REGULATORY AGENCY

02:05:57.216 --> 02:05:58.751
BECAUSE WE KNOW EVEN IF WE IF

02:05:58.817 --> 02:06:01.186
WE TAKE LIKE OUR CLIMATE GOALS

02:06:01.253 --> 02:06:03.155
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE. WE HAVE

02:06:03.222 --> 02:06:04.890
THESE GOALS AND BUT WE'RE

02:06:04.957 --> 02:06:06.592
MOVING WE KNOW THAT THEIR ALSO

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:08.527
IN NOT INCREMENTAL PER SE BUT

02:06:08.594 --> 02:06:10.029
WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS EACH YEAR

02:06:10.095 --> 02:06:11.864
WE'RE NOT EXPECTING TO DO THEM

02:06:11.931 --> 02:06:15.434
OVERNIGHT. AND SO IF WE DON'T

02:06:15.501 --> 02:06:17.202
IF WE PUT IN SOME INTENT

02:06:17.269 --> 02:06:19.238
LANGUAGE PERHAPS VERSUS VERY

02:06:19.305 --> 02:06:21.273
RIGID LANGUAGE IT MAY HELP.

02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:25.945
ACHIEVE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO-

02:06:26.011 --> 02:06:28.347
TO PROTECT AGAINST WITH-

02:06:28.414 --> 02:06:29.782
WITHOUT MESSING UP OUR MARKET

02:06:29.848 --> 02:06:31.550
SIGNAL AND NOW I KNOW I THINK

02:06:31.617 --> 02:06:33.252
YOU'RE QUITE FRANKLY I MEAN I'M

02:06:33.319 --> 02:06:35.521
GLAD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS

02:06:35.587 --> 02:06:38.290
BECAUSE I THINK OUR- OUR-

02:06:38.357 --> 02:06:40.092
THOUGHTS ELISE INITIALLY WAS

02:06:40.159 --> 02:06:41.460
THAT YOUR BILL IS GOING TO

02:06:41.527 --> 02:06:42.795
BECOME AN IMPORTANT VEHICLE FOR

02:06:42.861 --> 02:06:43.896
TIGHTENING UP THE CREATORS AND

02:06:43.963 --> 02:06:47.032
DEFINITION. OKAY AND NOW LOOKS

02:06:47.099 --> 02:06:49.768
LIKE THERE'S BEEN AN- BROWN'S

02:06:49.835 --> 02:06:50.970
BUDGET WELL I DID SAY IT'S AN

02:06:51.036 --> 02:06:52.338
ELEMENT OF FLUX I SUPPOSE SO I

02:06:52.404 --> 02:06:54.340
THINK WE'RE I THINK KIDS NOT TO

02:06:54.406 --> 02:06:56.375
MIX THEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR

02:06:56.442 --> 02:06:58.777
TO BUT I THINK IT'S AN WERE

02:06:58.844 --> 02:06:59.912
MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS AND I

02:06:59.979 --> 02:07:01.080
THINK IT'S IN GOOD. IT'S

OKAY THAT'S VERY HELPFUL MR

02:14:13.712 --> 02:14:15.414
SURE YET SO THERE ISN'T IT SO

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:16.748
THIS BILL WOULD BE MOVING THE

02:14:16.815 --> 02:14:17.949
MOTION WOULD BE TO MOVE THE

02:14:18.016 --> 02:14:20.585
BILL AS AMENDED. BUT THEN WHAT

02:14:20.652 --> 02:14:21.453
I'VE HEARD FROM CENTER TO LET

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:25.690
IS ALSO A COMMITMENT TO FURTHER.

02:14:25.757 --> 02:14:28.593
DISCUSSIONS- AT N. YEAH AND I

02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:29.895
AND I WOULD JUST I WOULD SAY IN

02:14:29.961 --> 02:14:31.263
THOSE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ALL I

WOULD ASK IS THAT. YOU WILL

02:14:33.331 --> 02:14:36.768
CONSIDER- THE DETAILS ON THE

02:14:36.835 --> 02:14:39.871
ANALYSIS THAT POINT OUT THAT I

02:14:39.938 --> 02:14:40.472
HEARD THAT THE PROPONENTS SAY

02:14:40.539 --> 02:14:43.108
THAT. NINETY SOME ODD PERCENT

02:14:43.175 --> 02:14:44.943
OF THE HYDROGEN PRODUCED IN

02:14:45.010 --> 02:14:46.645
CALIFORNIA IS DONE RENEWABLY I

02:14:46.711 --> 02:14:47.512
DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DEFINE

02:14:47.579 --> 02:14:49.281
RENEWABLY GET THE ANALYSIS

02:14:49.347 --> 02:14:51.383
POINTS OUT THAT. THE STATE

02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:52.417
REQUIREMENTS ONLY THAT FORTY

02:14:52.484 --> 02:14:55.220
PERCENT. OF THE HYDROGEN AT

02:14:55.287 --> 02:14:57.155
LEAST TO QUALIFY FOR L. CFS.

02:14:57.222 --> 02:14:59.791
HAVE A RENEWABLE THE ONLY 40%

02:14:59.858 --> 02:15:03.361
BE RENEWABLE- SOME JUST I'M I'M

02:15:03.428 --> 02:15:04.963
UNCLEAR LIKE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE

02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:07.399
BEFORE ALLOWING THE GAS COMPANY

02:15:07.466 --> 02:15:09.768
TO AND- TO SEEK BILLIONS OF

02:15:09.835 --> 02:15:11.169
DOLLARS OF RATE BASED

02:15:11.236 --> 02:15:13.738
INVESTMENTS FOR. FOR FUEL

02:15:13.805 --> 02:15:17.042
THAT'S 60% GAS NATURAL GAS

02:15:17.108 --> 02:15:18.176
BASED THE COULD COME FROM

02:15:18.243 --> 02:15:19.911
FRACKING FROM OTHER STATES AND

02:15:19.978 --> 02:15:21.146
PROBABLY WOULDN'T COME FROM

02:15:21.213 --> 02:15:23.014
FRACKED GAS FROM OTHER STATES.

02:15:23.081 --> 02:15:25.250
I GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT

02:15:25.317 --> 02:15:26.418
I'M I'M HEARING THAT YOU'RE

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:27.853
GOING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

02:15:27.919 --> 02:15:29.387
DIRECTION IN LIGHT OF ALSO THE

02:15:29.454 --> 02:15:30.489
WORK IS SENATOR SKINNER'S DOING

02:15:30.555 --> 02:15:32.691
SO. I'M I WANT TO GIVE YOU ALL

02:15:32.757 --> 02:15:34.893
SPACE TO DO WORK AND FLAG THAT

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:37.429
CONCERN ALL. ALMOST ALL STAY

02:15:37.496 --> 02:15:39.297
WITH THE CHAIR AND VOTE I DID A

02:15:39.364 --> 02:15:41.633
TO KEEP THIS MOVING BUT I- YEAH

02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:43.835
I SIGNAL THE SAME TO CENTER

02:15:43.902 --> 02:15:45.403
SKINNER ON HER GREEN HYDROGEN

02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:47.105
BILL BUT- MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE

02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:48.907
YEARS. TO DEFINE SOMETHING IS

02:15:48.974 --> 02:15:50.375
ZERO EMISSIONS WHICH THIS BILL

YOU KNOW ZERO MISSION THAT ZERO

02:15:55.146 --> 02:15:57.382
EMISSION TRANCE TRANSPORTATION.

02:15:57.449 --> 02:16:00.919
IS HYDROGEN FUEL VEHICLES I

02:16:00.986 --> 02:16:03.054
WOULD SAY ONLY IF THE HYDROGEN

02:16:03.121 --> 02:16:05.023
FUEL IS ZERO EMISSION. AND IF

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:09.227
IT'S. NOT YOUR MISSION IT SORT

02:16:09.294 --> 02:16:10.161
OF BECOMES A- MISNOMER IN THE

02:16:10.228 --> 02:16:11.630
DEATH. FOR CALLING ZERO THAT

02:16:11.696 --> 02:16:12.964
MIGHT BE 60% FOR GAS. BUT

02:16:13.031 --> 02:16:15.100
DOESN'T QUITE WORK ANYHOW I

02:16:15.166 --> 02:16:16.434
REALLY APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK

02:16:16.501 --> 02:16:18.737

COURSE. YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGE

02:16:26.912 --> 02:16:28.446
HERE IS. TALKING TO

02:16:28.513 --> 02:16:28.914
STAKEHOLDERS FOLKS THE

02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:31.016
MINISTRATION AIRPORT OTHERS-

02:16:31.082 --> 02:16:32.751
AND YOU KNOW THESE BILLS ARE

02:16:32.817 --> 02:16:37.188
pAND- SO I THINK WE'RE MAKING

02:16:37.255 --> 02:16:38.323
SOME GOOD PROGRESS ALONG THE

02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:40.659
LINES OF YOUR CORE CONCERNS

02:16:40.725 --> 02:16:43.595

OF THIS BILL KNOWING 4% OF WHAT

02:16:54.406 --> 02:16:56.041
KASKY CONCERNED DOLLARS IT'S AN

02:16:56.107 --> 02:16:58.376
EXHAUST. THE REQUESTED THOUGH I

02:16:58.443 --> 02:17:00.812
WAS SAID MY COLLEAGUES AS

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:02.981
CENTER STERN HAD. HIT THE NAIL

02:17:03.048 --> 02:17:03.748
ON THE HEAD RIGHT HERE RIGHT

02:17:03.815 --> 02:17:05.750
NOW IT SEEMS THAT THE RENEWABLE

02:17:05.817 --> 02:17:08.219
HYDROGEN HE SAID IN ORDER TO

02:17:08.286 --> 02:17:10.622
THE TO GET THE LOW CARBON FUEL

02:17:10.689 --> 02:17:12.991
STANDARD. THE MARKETPLACE IS

02:17:13.058 --> 02:17:14.492
GOING TO IT. THAT'S TOO

02:17:14.559 --> 02:17:16.261
ATTRACTIVE OF A IS A STATE

02:17:16.328 --> 02:17:18.430
SUBSIDY NOT TO MAKE IT 40%

02:17:18.496 --> 02:17:20.599
RENEWABLE I GUESS THE QUESTION

02:17:20.665 --> 02:17:21.800
FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

02:17:21.866 --> 02:17:23.768
AND- JUST FOLKS OUT THERE SAID.

02:17:23.835 --> 02:17:26.237
LOWENTHAL FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SET

02:17:26.304 --> 02:17:28.673
A RENEWABLE HYDROGEN RENEWABLE

02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:30.709
STANDARD HYDROGEN AT THIRTY

02:17:30.775 --> 02:17:33.578
THREE POINT 3% IT IS CRACKED UP

02:17:33.645 --> 02:17:34.245
TO THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT. WE

02:17:34.312 --> 02:17:35.747
KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GET THE LOW

02:17:35.814 --> 02:17:39.751
CARBON FUEL STANDARD YOU. NEED

02:17:39.818 --> 02:17:40.385
TO GET FORTY. IN THIS. WE WANT

02:17:40.452 --> 02:17:41.152
TO KILL THE GOAL GOOSE BECAUSE

02:17:41.219 --> 02:17:43.188
WE CAN STIPULATE THAT HAVING

02:17:43.254 --> 02:17:46.891
HYDROGEN VEHICLES. ARE MUCH.

02:17:46.958 --> 02:17:47.726
MUCH BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

02:17:47.792 --> 02:17:49.661
AND DIESEL VEHICLES AT DELL

02:17:49.728 --> 02:17:51.229
BEING REPLACED I THINK IT'S THE

02:17:51.296 --> 02:17:52.998
DETAILS OF HOW DO WE-

02:17:53.064 --> 02:17:55.734
INCENTIVIZE IS. MY COLLEAGUES-

02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:59.104
FROM. BERKELEY AND- INDICATED

02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:01.106
THAT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE-

02:18:01.172 --> 02:18:02.874
INCENTIVIZE A CREEPING UP OF A

02:18:02.941 --> 02:18:05.677
RENEWABLE CONTENT. WITHIN THE

02:18:05.744 --> 02:18:07.679
USE IT WITHIN THE PROCESS OF

02:18:07.746 --> 02:18:10.115
CREATING- HYDROGEN THAT DOESN'T

02:18:10.181 --> 02:18:11.883
JUST. MAKE THE MARKET GO FLAT

02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:13.652
SO. WE'LL PAY ATTENTION THIS IS

02:18:13.718 --> 02:18:15.887
COMING BEFORE SUBCOMMITTEE TO

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:17.622
WITH THE ZEV MANDATE. THAT

02:18:17.689 --> 02:18:20.025
INCLUDES HYDROGEN- FOR US TO

02:18:20.091 --> 02:18:21.459
WILL. THAT SUBCOMMITTEE WILL

02:18:21.526 --> 02:18:23.828
HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT

02:18:23.895 --> 02:18:25.196
ALSO SO. I THINK CENTER SKINNER

02:18:25.263 --> 02:18:27.065
MOVED MATTER YEAH WE ALSO HAVE

02:18:27.132 --> 02:18:29.300
A COUPLE CENTERS ON A ONE TO.

02:18:29.367 --> 02:18:31.569
CENTER DOLLY THANK YOU. THANK

02:18:31.636 --> 02:18:33.805
YOU MISTER CHAIRED SO LOOK I

02:18:33.872 --> 02:18:35.607
YOU'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:37.142
IN THIS SPACE WITH. HOW DO

02:18:37.208 --> 02:18:39.144
NIAGARA I THINK THERE'S A TOTAL

02:18:39.210 --> 02:18:40.779
NEED FOR CALIFORNIA THINK WE'VE

02:18:40.845 --> 02:18:43.682
MISSED THE MARK- BY FOCUSING SO

02:18:43.748 --> 02:18:46.017
MUCH ON YOU KNOW. SEMATARY

02:18:46.084 --> 02:18:47.819
STORAGE HELL TO SAY AND WHEN

02:18:47.886 --> 02:18:49.354
YOU TALK ABOUT. I'M IN THE

02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:50.889
TRANSPORTATION IS WE RUN DIESEL

02:18:50.955 --> 02:18:53.558
TRUCKS AND- TO DO BATTERY%

02:18:53.625 --> 02:18:54.159
TECHNOLOGY THERE'S GOING TO BE

02:18:54.225 --> 02:18:57.062
I THINK. SOMEONE VERY DIFFICULT

02:18:57.128 --> 02:18:58.163
TO MOVE THE PRODUCTS AND GOODS

02:18:58.229 --> 02:18:59.464
THAT WE NEED TO SO I THINK I

02:18:59.531 --> 02:19:01.132
JUNE IS THE ANSWER I THINK

02:19:01.199 --> 02:19:03.868
THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR THAT-

02:19:03.935 --> 02:19:04.803
BUT IN THIS BILL AND I VOTED

02:19:04.869 --> 02:19:06.705
FOR. I SAW THIS AND I THINK WE

02:19:06.771 --> 02:19:08.339
SAW THIS AND ENERGY ENERGIA AND

02:19:08.406 --> 02:19:09.541
I VOTED AGAINST THE BILL OF THE

02:19:09.607 --> 02:19:10.909
THEM THEN THE REASON I VOTED

02:19:10.975 --> 02:19:12.677
AGAINST BILLS THAT. I WANTED

02:19:12.744 --> 02:19:15.780
WHAT YOU DID TO EXPLAIN HOW THE

02:19:15.847 --> 02:19:17.182
RATE PAYERS- WOULD NOT BE

02:19:17.248 --> 02:19:18.650
IMPACTED BY THIS BILL I BELIEVE

02:19:18.717 --> 02:19:22.787
THEY WILL BE. AND IF I READ

02:19:22.854 --> 02:19:25.056
ONLINE AS THE SEE WHAT SECTION

02:19:25.123 --> 02:19:26.624
I MEAN HERE BUT- BASS HE SAYS

02:19:26.691 --> 02:19:29.027
COST SHIFTING CUT- TO THE

02:19:29.094 --> 02:19:30.295
COMMISSION SHALL NOT APPROVE

02:19:30.361 --> 02:19:32.063
ANY PROGRAM OR INVESTMENT

02:19:32.130 --> 02:19:33.064
PERSONAL INTO THE SUBDIVISION

02:19:33.131 --> 02:19:35.066
THAT WOULD RESULT IN EITHER. OF

02:19:35.133 --> 02:19:37.268
THE FALL EITHER THE FOLLOWING.

02:19:37.335 --> 02:19:39.270
KASHIF DIDN'T CUSTOMER RATES.

02:19:39.337 --> 02:19:39.771
AND WE HEARD SOME OF THE

02:19:39.838 --> 02:19:41.639
OPPOSITION THAT CAME IN-

02:19:41.706 --> 02:19:44.509
TALKING ABOUT COST SHIFT IN THE

02:19:44.576 --> 02:19:45.910
TYPICAL. HOMEOWNER IN

02:19:45.977 --> 02:19:48.213
CALIFORNIA IS RATES ARE

02:19:48.279 --> 02:19:49.581
DIFFERENT THAN THE INDUSTRIAL

02:19:49.647 --> 02:19:51.950
RATES WHICH THOSE OF US IN AG

02:19:52.016 --> 02:19:55.286
INDUSTRY- PAY A HIGHER RATE- TO

02:19:55.353 --> 02:19:57.021
THE AISLE USED IN THE NORMAL

02:19:57.088 --> 02:19:58.923
HOUSE TO SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT

02:19:58.990 --> 02:20:00.258

ECONOMICALLY AS THERE IS HARSH

02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:24.749
THERE WILL BE NO COST SHIFTING

02:20:24.816 --> 02:20:27.252
OF THOSE THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM

02:20:27.318 --> 02:20:29.387
THIS PROJECT WILL BE PAYING FOR

02:20:29.454 --> 02:20:33.525
IT IN THE RATE SO IT WON'T BE-

02:20:33.591 --> 02:20:37.228
SPREAD ACROSS ENTIRELY BATES.

02:20:37.295 --> 02:20:39.531
SO THE SO THE PER THE PEOPLE

02:20:39.597 --> 02:20:41.099
WHO ARE INVESTING IN THIS

PARTICIPATING YOU KNOW I NEED

02:20:48.973 --> 02:20:51.042
FOR A PROJECT ON MINOR OTHER

02:20:51.109 --> 02:20:52.911
KINDS OF PROJECTS WHERE DOES

02:20:52.977 --> 02:20:56.314
THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM IT ARE

02:20:56.381 --> 02:21:04.355
PAYING FOR IT WITHIN THEIR RATE.

02:21:04.422 --> 02:21:06.925
I'M CONFUSED THEN OF HOW YOU'RE

02:21:06.991 --> 02:21:07.525
GOING TO CREATE THE RESOURCES

02:21:07.592 --> 02:21:10.862
TO GET IT DONE. THE I. O. U.'S

02:21:10.929 --> 02:21:11.729
ARE WHY ARE WE GOING TO THE P.

02:21:11.796 --> 02:21:13.431
YOU SEE THAT. IF THEY DON'T

02:21:13.498 --> 02:21:15.433
HAVE TO INCREASE THE RATE THEY

02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:18.469
COULD JUST SIMPLY GO. INVEST IN

02:21:18.536 --> 02:21:19.037
THE TECHNOLOGY AND DO IT ON

02:21:19.103 --> 02:21:23.308
THEIR OWN. SENATOR I UNDERSTAND

02:21:23.374 --> 02:21:24.809
THAT I THINK IT'S OF ALL THAT

02:21:24.876 --> 02:21:27.712
THE IRAQIS CORY AND HAVING A

02:21:27.779 --> 02:21:28.980
COMMON DISTRIBUTION

02:21:29.047 --> 02:21:30.982
INFRASTRUCTURE NO THAT ARE IN

02:21:31.049 --> 02:21:32.417
THE PRIVATE SECTOR I THINK WE

02:21:32.483 --> 02:21:34.686
MAKE- DISTRIBUTION

02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:36.154
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S JUST A

02:21:36.221 --> 02:21:39.257
QUICK A QUICK ABOUT THE WAY. TO

02:21:39.324 --> 02:21:44.996
HAVE A BROAD NETWORK THAT IS-

02:21:45.063 --> 02:21:50.168
ACCEPTABLE TO ALL. THANK YOU.

02:21:50.235 --> 02:21:51.069
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THEM

02:21:51.135 --> 02:21:53.838
FROM THE SITE AGAIN CLIENTS AS

02:21:53.905 --> 02:21:56.574
WELL- IT ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE TO

02:21:56.641 --> 02:21:59.077
LOOK AT IS TAKING A GAMBLE- BUT

02:21:59.143 --> 02:22:00.778
THE COURTS OF SAN PEDRO THEY

02:22:00.845 --> 02:22:02.847
WANT TO BECOME ZERO EMISSION

02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:04.749
AND SO THE CHOICES HOW DO WE

02:22:04.816 --> 02:22:05.817
WANT TO DO THAT YOUR LETTER

02:22:05.884 --> 02:22:08.419
CATION THROUGH GRADES AND

02:22:08.486 --> 02:22:11.122
BATTERIES OR TWO HYDROGEN SO

02:22:11.189 --> 02:22:13.358
WITHOUT SB SIX SIX TWO- THE

02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:14.225
ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE THE

02:22:14.292 --> 02:22:15.760
TERMINAL OPERATORS WOULD BE TO

02:22:15.827 --> 02:22:17.595
ALLOW THE BREAK TRADERS TO PAY

02:22:17.662 --> 02:22:19.297
FOR A GREAT EXPANSION INTO THE

02:22:19.364 --> 02:22:20.832
COURTS AND UPSTREAM GREAT

02:22:20.899 --> 02:22:22.734
EXPANSION TO SUPPORT THOSE TENS

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:27.071
OR HUNDREDS. OF MEGAWATTS THAT

02:22:27.138 --> 02:22:27.639
WOULD NEED TO BE CERTAIN. IT

02:22:27.705 --> 02:22:28.640
WILL NOT KNOW IT BACK COULD BE

02:22:28.706 --> 02:22:31.109
DONE MARCH. GEN AVAILABLE

02:22:31.175 --> 02:22:33.411
HYDROGEN INDUSTRY OF A GLOBAL I

02:22:33.478 --> 02:22:34.879
TO COURT PARTICULARLY WHEN WE

02:22:34.946 --> 02:22:36.681
IS CONCERNED. AND WHEN THE

02:22:36.748 --> 02:22:38.583
UPTIME REPORT AND HAVING ENGINE

02:22:38.650 --> 02:22:39.717
SURVIVE WITH A HIGH PERCENT

02:22:39.784 --> 02:22:42.553
RELIABILITY CONCERNED SO IT CAN

02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:44.689
NAY EBELING THE ANALYSIS TO BE

02:22:44.756 --> 02:22:47.492
DONE COULD HYDROGEN SERVE THAT

02:22:47.558 --> 02:22:49.227
VERY LARGE ELECTRIFICATION

02:22:49.294 --> 02:22:52.263
BORROWED MORE. ECONOMICALLY

02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:53.898
BENEFICIAL EIGHTY AND STILL

02:22:53.965 --> 02:23:01.739
ACHIEVE ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS.

02:23:01.806 --> 02:23:04.709
OKAY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:23:04.776 --> 02:23:09.580
THERE WERE- ERIC IS ERIC

02:23:09.647 --> 02:23:11.249
AVAILABLE BY PHONE AS HE CAN

02:23:11.316 --> 02:23:12.650
GET ON THE PHONE BECAUSE IT'S

02:23:12.717 --> 02:23:14.886
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAD

02:23:14.953 --> 02:23:18.156
YOU THERE IS A- WE DIDN'T TOUCH

02:23:18.222 --> 02:23:19.958
THE RATE. LANGUAGE BUT IT WAS

02:23:20.024 --> 02:23:25.430
WORKED ON AND YOU SEE YOU SEE-

02:23:25.496 --> 02:23:26.397
THERE WERE SOME AMENDMENTS

02:23:26.464 --> 02:23:28.433
ADDED ON RELATING TO RATE

02:23:28.499 --> 02:23:35.139
PAYERS- BUT YOU DON'T WANNA DO

02:23:35.206 --> 02:23:36.040
THAT WE DID NOT COME IN

02:23:36.107 --> 02:23:38.209
DESCRIBING DISCUSSION SENATOR

02:23:38.276 --> 02:23:41.546
DURING ENERGY TOO MANY. THE

02:23:41.612 --> 02:23:46.384
BOAT. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS

02:23:46.451 --> 02:23:48.853
THAT WE'RE NOT THERE'S NO WAY.

02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:50.722
THE RATEPAYERS MAKE YOU CAN'T

02:23:50.788 --> 02:23:51.689
AFFORD LIKE CHRISTINE

02:23:51.756 --> 02:23:54.892
CALIFORNIA'S IT IS WE HAVE 42%

02:23:54.959 --> 02:23:55.994
HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER STATE AND

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:57.628
I JUST THE WAY I READ THIS

02:23:57.695 --> 02:24:00.231
BEFORE AN ANALYSIS I HAVE IT

02:24:00.298 --> 02:24:00.832
SAYS RIGHT HERE THAT THE RATES

02:24:00.898 --> 02:24:02.100
ARE GOING TO BE. THAT REPAIRS

02:24:02.166 --> 02:24:06.170
WILL PICK UP. IT WILL BE PART

02:24:06.237 --> 02:24:07.305
OF THE COST AND SO THAT MEANS

02:24:07.372 --> 02:24:09.173
THAT IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN

02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:10.408
THAT MEANS THAT SOMEWHERE RATES

02:24:10.475 --> 02:24:12.276
ARE GONNA GO UP AND SO I'M

02:24:12.343 --> 02:24:13.344
TRYING TO GET MY MIND AROUND

02:24:13.411 --> 02:24:14.345
HOW THIS ACTUALLY WORKS THE

02:24:14.412 --> 02:24:16.314
POLICY OF IT HOW HOW IT WORKS

02:24:16.381 --> 02:24:18.516
IS. IF THE RATES ARE GONNA GO

02:24:18.583 --> 02:24:23.621
UP. I'M TRYING TO JUST FIGURE

02:24:23.688 --> 02:24:26.157
OUT WORKS I LOOK UP I WOULD IF

02:24:26.224 --> 02:24:28.192
YOU IF WE HAVE A LOT OF EXCESS.

02:24:28.259 --> 02:24:29.727
ENERGY AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE

02:24:29.794 --> 02:24:30.728
DAY WE HAVE THE DOCTOR BUT WELL

02:24:30.795 --> 02:24:32.163
TALK ABOUT IT WE TALK ABOUT

02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:34.732
ENERGY COMMISSION AND I WANTED

02:24:34.799 --> 02:24:35.666
THAT TO GO FLAT THAT'S MY GOAL

02:24:35.733 --> 02:24:37.935
IF WE COULD. TAKE THAT ENERGY

02:24:38.002 --> 02:24:39.370
THAT WERE BASICALLY SHE

02:24:39.437 --> 02:24:40.772
COULDN'T AGREED THAT DOESN'T DO

02:24:40.838 --> 02:24:41.906
US ANY GOOD AND MAKE HYDROGEN

02:24:41.973 --> 02:24:43.174
OUT OF IT HEY WE SHOULD BE

02:24:43.241 --> 02:24:45.109
DOING THAT AND I THINK THAT

02:24:45.176 --> 02:24:46.077
EVERYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE WE

02:24:46.144 --> 02:24:47.645
TALK ABOUT IT. BUT WE NEED TO

02:24:47.712 --> 02:24:49.247
FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WORKS THE

02:24:49.313 --> 02:24:49.847
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WHERE DO

02:24:49.914 --> 02:24:52.383
WE SITE THESE PROJECTS WHERE DO

02:24:52.450 --> 02:24:54.652
WE HAVE ACCESS. EXTRA EXTRA

02:24:54.719 --> 02:24:57.522
ENERGY DURING DOES THAT HOURS

02:24:57.588 --> 02:24:59.590
OF THE DAY THAT WE ALL KNOW THE

02:24:59.657 --> 02:25:01.592
DUCK CURVE IS MESSED UP WE NEED

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:02.927
TO TRANSFER THAT TO THE VALLEY

02:25:02.994 --> 02:25:04.996
OF THE DOCK AND YOU KNOW WILL

02:25:05.063 --> 02:25:06.030
REALLY BE DOING SOMETHING GREAT

02:25:06.097 --> 02:25:07.365
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND I'M

02:25:07.432 --> 02:25:07.899
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I

02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:09.634
THINK HYDROGEN IS A HYDROGEN IS

02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:11.169
A KEY TO THAT. I THINK THERE'S

02:25:11.235 --> 02:25:12.270
I THINK WE NEED TO BE A

02:25:12.336 --> 02:25:14.338
COMBINATION OF ALL DIFFERENT

02:25:14.405 --> 02:25:17.108
TYPES OF STORAGE PROJECT BUT I

02:25:17.175 --> 02:25:19.043
HAVEN'T SEEN THE POLICY HAD

02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.844
THAT COMES THROUGH THE SAYS HEY

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:21.813
OKAY LOOK. IN THE CENTRAL

02:25:21.879 --> 02:25:23.614
VALLEY WE HAVE THIS MANY

02:25:23.681 --> 02:25:25.450
MEGAWATTS OF EXTRA POWER WHEN

02:25:25.516 --> 02:25:26.284
THE SUN SHINING AND THE WINDS

02:25:26.350 --> 02:25:27.985
BLOWING. THIS IS WHERE WE

02:25:28.052 --> 02:25:29.253
SHOULD START TO PLAN AND BUILD

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:30.822
A HYDROGEN I HAVEN'T SEEN IT

02:25:30.888 --> 02:25:32.957
YET SO FOR ME IT SEEMS LIKE IT

02:25:33.024 --> 02:25:37.028
ALWAYS GOES BACK. TO THE RATE

02:25:37.095 --> 02:25:38.029
PAYER AND- BECAUSE- BEING BEING

02:25:38.096 --> 02:25:39.831
PICK UP THE COST OF. MAKING OUR

02:25:39.897 --> 02:25:42.200
ENERGY. MORE RELYING OKAY SO

02:25:42.266 --> 02:25:43.167
THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING IS

02:25:43.234 --> 02:25:44.335
TRYING TO TELL ME HOW THAT'S

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:45.703
GONNA WORK AND I DON'T SEE IT

02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:47.605
IN THIS. OKAY DO THAT TO BE

02:25:47.672 --> 02:25:49.574
FAIR THE SIMPSONS GOING BACK TO

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:52.110
PAGE SIX THE FAMOUS PAGE SIX OF

02:25:52.176 --> 02:25:54.779
THIS BILL- THE AMENDMENT THE

02:25:54.846 --> 02:25:55.913

ABOUT THE LANGUAGE ABOUT

02:26:00.451 --> 02:26:02.987
POLLUTION. BOB IN ADDITION

02:26:03.054 --> 02:26:03.788
THOUGH IT SAYS THE COMMISSION

02:26:04.956 --> 02:26:06.390
OR INVESTMENT PURSUANT TO THIS

02:26:06.457 --> 02:26:08.192
SUBDIVISION THAT WOULD RESULT.

02:26:08.259 --> 02:26:10.661
THIS IS C. THREE. SUBBASAL NOT

02:26:10.728 --> 02:26:11.729

THREE THOUSAND WOMEN IN ENERGY

02:26:25.643 --> 02:26:30.815
COMMITTEE. THIS CAN. WHAT IS

02:26:30.882 --> 02:26:33.718
NEEDED I WAS N THAT WAS THAT

AFTER. FIVE I KNOW CENTER STERN

02:26:44.695 --> 02:26:47.331
HAD AND SOME COMPSON SOME

02:26:47.398 --> 02:26:48.032
THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

02:26:48.099 --> 02:26:49.400
EJECUTIVAS OVER THERE AND TO BE

02:26:49.467 --> 02:26:50.568

CONSIDER YOU GIVEN THE FACT

02:26:51.869 --> 02:26:53.771
THAT THE GREEN HYDROGEN BILLS

02:26:53.838 --> 02:26:55.139
COMING UP ON THE THAT SKINNER

02:26:55.206 --> 02:26:56.374
SKINNER STILL I I'M ACTUALLY

02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:57.909
WONDERING WHETHER WE MIGHT WANT

02:26:57.975 --> 02:26:58.743
TO DISCONTINUE THIS BILL TO

02:26:58.809 --> 02:27:00.545
THURSDAY SO WE GET SOME OF

02:27:00.611 --> 02:27:02.380
THESE ISSUES CLARIFIED. YOU

ISSUES RELATING TO CENTER

02:27:04.582 --> 02:27:06.751
SKINNER SPELL ARE STILL BEING

02:27:06.817 --> 02:27:07.985
CRYSTALLIZING THEY'RE DIRECTLY

02:27:08.052 --> 02:27:09.820
RELATED TO SEASON IN THIS BILL

02:27:09.887 --> 02:27:12.223
AND SO I'M BEGINNING TO BELIEVE

02:27:12.290 --> 02:27:15.293
THAT MIGHT BE THE RIGHT COURSE

02:27:15.359 --> 02:27:15.826
OF ACTION LET'S GO TO YOU

02:27:15.893 --> 02:27:16.827

OUT THAT IN ENERGY COMMITTEE.

02:27:21.899 --> 02:27:23.467
CENTER DR THE AMENDMENT CENTER

02:27:23.534 --> 02:27:27.205
ARCHULETA TOOK. PREVENTED-

02:27:27.271 --> 02:27:29.006
INVENTED THE ANY OF THESE COST

02:27:29.073 --> 02:27:31.676
BEING BORNE BY ALL RATE PAYERS.

02:27:31.742 --> 02:27:32.977
I MEAN YOU COULD SHIFT COSTS

02:27:33.044 --> 02:27:34.745
SAVE THE PORT BUILT SOME OF

02:27:34.812 --> 02:27:36.347
THAT HUNDRED INFRASTRUCTURE

02:27:36.414 --> 02:27:38.249
THEY COULD PUSH THOSE COSTS ON

02:27:38.316 --> 02:27:39.750
TO THOSE WHO AREN'T BENEFITING

02:27:39.817 --> 02:27:41.419
FROM IT SO THAT'S WHAT THE

02:27:41.485 --> 02:27:42.587
CAUTIOUS LANGUAGE DOES IF I

02:27:42.653 --> 02:27:44.822
COULD. JUST CLARIFY THAT FOR

02:27:44.889 --> 02:27:46.224

OPPOSED TO THE GENERAL RATE

02:27:53.164 --> 02:27:54.065
BASE NOW THAT STILL IS

02:27:54.131 --> 02:27:56.834
TECHNICALLY RATE BASING IT TO

02:27:56.901 --> 02:27:58.236
SOME EXTENT BUT- ANYWAY. OUR

IN THIS BILL- IT'S BASICALLY A

02:41:38.555 --> 02:41:39.589
REINTRODUCTION OF LAST YEAR'S

02:41:39.656 --> 02:41:43.393
BILL. THE IDEA IS THAT SB FIFTY

02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:45.162
FOUR- SEEKS TO. REDUCE THE

02:41:45.228 --> 02:41:47.631
AMOUNT OF DISPOSABLE SINGLE USE

PACKAGING IN FOOD WHERE WASTED

02:41:49.733 --> 02:41:51.234
BURDENS TAXPAYERS LOCAL

ALSO IMPACTS HUMAN HEALTH

02:41:57.374 --> 02:41:59.409
WE'VE- LOOKED A BIT INTO SOME

02:41:59.476 --> 02:42:03.246
OF THE TOXICITY ASSOCIATED.

02:42:03.313 --> 02:42:03.847
WITH ALL THE PLASTICS THAT ARE

02:42:03.914 --> 02:42:04.481
GETTING INTO OUR BODIES. HERE'S

02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:05.082
SOME FACTS WE ALL HEARD FIRST

02:42:05.148 --> 02:42:10.253
WHAT. LILLY LESSONS PERCENT OF

02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:11.822
SINGLE USE PLASTIC IS ACTUALLY

02:42:11.888 --> 02:42:14.191
RECYCLED. THE COST OF RECYCLING

02:42:14.257 --> 02:42:16.259
IT IS NOW EXCEEDING THE SCRAP

02:42:16.326 --> 02:42:17.894
VALUE OF THE PLASTIC MATERIAL

02:42:17.961 --> 02:42:20.764
ITSELF. I NEARLY EVERY PER

02:42:20.831 --> 02:42:22.466
PIECE OF PLASTIC IT'S PRODUCED

02:42:22.532 --> 02:42:24.034
IT'S EVER BEEN PRODUCED IT

02:42:24.101 --> 02:42:25.869
STILL EXISTS IN OUR LANDFILLS

02:42:25.936 --> 02:42:26.937
STILL EXISTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT

02:42:27.003 --> 02:42:29.005
THESE ITEMS FRAGMENT INTO

02:42:29.072 --> 02:42:29.506
SMALLER AND SMALLER PART

02:42:29.573 --> 02:42:31.675
PARTICLES. NOT CONCENTRATING

02:42:31.741 --> 02:42:32.809
TOXIC CHEMICALS AND

02:42:32.876 --> 02:42:33.844
CONTAMINATING OUR FOOD AND

02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:35.345
DRINKING WATER SOURCES WE'RE

02:42:35.412 --> 02:42:37.214
ALL APPARENTLY CONSUMING ABOUT

02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:38.882
A CREDIT CARDS WORTH. OF

02:42:38.949 --> 02:42:41.184
PLASTIC EACH WEEK. INTO OUR

02:42:41.251 --> 02:42:42.586
BODIES SAID THAT SOME OF YOU

02:42:42.652 --> 02:42:45.088
GUYS GOT A CHANCE TO SIT IN ON

02:42:45.155 --> 02:42:46.456
ON THE CELL NUMBER CORKS

02:42:46.523 --> 02:42:48.391
HEARING WHICH TALKED ABOUT. THE

02:42:48.458 --> 02:42:50.026
FACT THAT A MAJORITY OF HUMAN

02:42:50.093 --> 02:42:52.028
PLACENTAS NOW HAVE. MORNING

02:42:52.095 --> 02:42:54.097
LEVELS OF PLASTIC THAT ARE

02:42:54.164 --> 02:42:56.133
BEING- IT POTENTIALLY PASSING

02:42:56.199 --> 02:42:58.168
ON THAT TOXICITY TO. NEWBORN

02:42:58.235 --> 02:43:00.470
BABIES. SO THIS EXPOSURE IS

02:43:00.537 --> 02:43:01.638
GOING TO PLAY CANCERS BIRTH

02:43:01.705 --> 02:43:03.373
DEFECTS AND IMPAIRED IMMUNITY

02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:04.741
ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION AND OTHER

02:43:04.808 --> 02:43:06.276
SERVICE YOURSELF PROBLEMS IT'S

02:43:06.343 --> 02:43:07.878
ALSO BECOMING A- FINANCIAL

02:43:07.944 --> 02:43:10.213
ISSUE. FOR OUR COMMUNITY START

02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:11.515
GUIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BEEN

02:43:11.581 --> 02:43:12.115
ABOUT HALF A BILLION DOLLARS A

02:43:12.182 --> 02:43:14.518
YEAR NOW ON. ON ON LITTER

02:43:14.584 --> 02:43:16.386
CLEANUP AND LITTER PREVENTION-

02:43:16.453 --> 02:43:17.654
BUT THEY'RE ALSO IMPORTANTLY

02:43:17.721 --> 02:43:18.855
AND THIS GETS TO SOME OF THE

02:43:18.922 --> 02:43:19.890
ISSUES WE TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE

02:43:19.956 --> 02:43:21.191
WEEKS AGO. YOU'LL REMEMBER THIS

02:43:21.258 --> 02:43:22.526
CONVERSATION CENTER DOLLY

02:43:22.592 --> 02:43:23.627
CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE NOW

02:43:23.693 --> 02:43:24.995
RAISING THEIR GARBAGE AND

02:43:25.061 --> 02:43:26.796
RECYCLING RATES TO KEEP UP WITH

02:43:26.863 --> 02:43:27.998
THE MOUNTING COSTS OF MANAGING

02:43:28.064 --> 02:43:28.798
ALL THE MATERIAL IT'S

02:43:28.865 --> 02:43:31.067
ULTIMATELY OUR- VOTERS ARE.

02:43:31.134 --> 02:43:32.569
TAXPAYERS REPAIRS THAT ARE

02:43:32.636 --> 02:43:34.504
PAYING MORE AND MORE. TO

02:43:34.571 --> 02:43:35.405
ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THE

02:43:35.472 --> 02:43:37.340
PRODUCERS HAVE NO SKIN IN THE

02:43:37.407 --> 02:43:38.041
GAME OF THE GUARDS OF THE

02:43:38.108 --> 02:43:38.842
PRODUCTS THEY'RE PUTTING OUT ON

02:43:38.909 --> 02:43:40.744
TO THE MARKET. SO SINCE COUNTY

02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:42.579
SACRAMENTO JUST RAISE THE RATES

02:43:42.646 --> 02:43:44.981
ADDITIONAL TEN DOLLARS A MONTH.

02:43:45.048 --> 02:43:46.183
TO HANDLE THE WASTE MANAGEMENT

02:43:46.249 --> 02:43:47.184
CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE HAVING

02:43:47.250 --> 02:43:48.385
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS

02:43:48.451 --> 02:43:49.986
HERE WITH THIS BILL WHICH IS.

02:43:50.053 --> 02:43:51.054
SEEKS TO ESTABLISH A

02:43:51.121 --> 02:43:55.859
COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK. TO

02:43:55.926 --> 02:43:56.393
ADDRESS THIS POLLUTION AND

02:43:56.459 --> 02:43:57.194
WASTE. RACES IN THREE KEY WAYS

02:43:57.260 --> 02:44:00.263
OF ALL IT'S- BE. THE COSTS OF

02:44:00.330 --> 02:44:01.665
THE END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT OF

02:44:01.731 --> 02:44:03.600
THIS MATERIAL TO THE PRODUCERS

02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:05.035
WHO ARE ULTIMATELY THE ONES WHO

02:44:05.101 --> 02:44:06.403
REALLY DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT A

02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:08.271
PACKAGE FOR YOU KNOW WHAT

02:44:08.338 --> 02:44:10.507
WHETHER NOT TO THE- TO PACKAGE

02:44:10.574 --> 02:44:12.442
THEIR THEIR PRODUCT IN

02:44:12.509 --> 02:44:14.044
RECYCLABLE CONTAINER OR SOME.

02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:15.378
MULTILAYERED POUCH THE WHILE

02:44:15.445 --> 02:44:17.881
CONVENER FLASHY. BECOMES TRASH

02:44:17.948 --> 02:44:18.782
THE CLOGS OUR LANDFILLS WE'VE

02:44:18.848 --> 02:44:21.084
WE'VE- COME ACROSS SITUATIONS

02:44:21.151 --> 02:44:22.552
WHERE- PRODUCERS WILL LITERALLY

02:44:22.619 --> 02:44:24.087
CHANGE THE RESIN TYPE IN A

02:44:24.154 --> 02:44:25.822
BOTTLE. NO DO IT FOR IN A

02:44:25.889 --> 02:44:27.791
STATIC REASON AND THAT DECISION

02:44:27.857 --> 02:44:28.992
WILL SINGLE HANDEDLY RENDER

02:44:29.059 --> 02:44:30.860
THAT ITEM NON RECYCLABLE IT

02:44:30.927 --> 02:44:31.728
MEANS THAT THAT ITEM INSTEAD OF

02:44:31.795 --> 02:44:33.930
BEING- SENATOR RECYCLING SYSTEM

02:44:33.997 --> 02:44:35.365
IS NOW. GOING STRAIGHT TO THE

02:44:35.432 --> 02:44:36.533
LANDFILL AND F COURSE IT'S US

02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:38.168
IT'S THE TAXPAYERS THE REPAIRS

02:44:38.235 --> 02:44:39.636
THAT ARE PAYING THE COST. OF

02:44:39.703 --> 02:44:40.870
THAT EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE

02:44:40.937 --> 02:44:41.571
PRODUCER WHO'S MAKING THE

02:44:41.638 --> 02:44:42.939
DECISION WITH LITTLE OR NO

02:44:43.006 --> 02:44:43.873
ACCOUNTABILITY OR SKIN IN THE

02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:46.509
GAME MORE. RESPONSIBILITY

02:44:46.576 --> 02:44:47.877
ASSOCIATED. THE SET UP THE

02:44:47.944 --> 02:44:49.379
FIRST THING. THE SECOND ISSUE

02:44:49.446 --> 02:44:50.880
IS SOURCE REDUCTION SO ASKING

02:44:50.947 --> 02:44:52.916
THEM TO YOUR RIGHT SIZE THEIR

02:44:52.983 --> 02:44:54.217
PACKAGING AND MOVE TOWARD

02:44:54.284 --> 02:44:57.254
REUSABLE SO. WHEREVER THEY CAN.

02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:58.355
AND THEN LASTLY REQUIRING THE

02:44:58.421 --> 02:45:00.056
MATERIAL. THAT DOES REMAIN IN

02:45:00.123 --> 02:45:01.524
THE MARKETPLACE BE TRULY

02:45:01.591 --> 02:45:03.793
RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE WITH

02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:05.962
METRICS TO BACK THAT UP- AND

02:45:06.029 --> 02:45:07.230
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THIS HAS TO

02:45:07.297 --> 02:45:08.865
DO WITH MOVING FOLKS THAT

02:45:08.932 --> 02:45:09.799
THERE'S LOTS OF TYPES OF

02:45:09.866 --> 02:45:10.734
PLASTIC WE TALKED ABOUT YOU

02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:13.436
KNOW THE NUMBERS. ONE THREE

02:45:13.503 --> 02:45:14.938
SEVEN AND- AND SOMETIMES IF A

02:45:15.005 --> 02:45:16.239
PRODUCER SIMPLY JUST CHANGES

02:45:16.306 --> 02:45:18.675
THEIR PLASTIC USE FROM A THREE

02:45:18.742 --> 02:45:20.777
TO A TWO. THAT ACTUALLY RENDERS

02:45:20.844 --> 02:45:23.480
THE ITEM RECYCLABLE- IT'S THE

02:45:23.546 --> 02:45:25.215
YOU KNOW- DID BUT RIGHT NOW

02:45:25.282 --> 02:45:26.783
THERE'S NO THERE'S NO- THERE'S

02:45:26.850 --> 02:45:29.519
THEY HAVE NO SKIN IN THE GAME

02:45:29.586 --> 02:45:30.086
ASSOCIATED WITH MAKING THAT

02:45:30.153 --> 02:45:31.721
DECISION. SO WE KNOW THIS IS A

02:45:31.788 --> 02:45:33.156
TOUGH AND COMPLICATED ISSUE WE

02:45:33.223 --> 02:45:34.591
SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THE

02:45:34.658 --> 02:45:36.026
TWO AS TWO AND A HALF YEARS. IN

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:37.627
DETAILED DISCUSSIONS WITH

02:45:37.694 --> 02:45:38.528
STAKEHOLDERS WE MADE A LOT OF

02:45:38.595 --> 02:45:41.398
PROGRESS- YOU KNOW WE CAME VERY

02:45:41.464 --> 02:45:42.065
CLOSE TO GETTING THE BILL

02:45:42.132 --> 02:45:43.266
PASSED LAST YEAR THE POLICY

02:45:43.333 --> 02:45:45.001
PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE. OF

02:45:45.068 --> 02:45:47.437
THE BOTH IN EARLY FORM AND THEN

02:45:47.504 --> 02:45:49.406
ALSO IN FINAL FORM- YOU KNOW

02:45:49.472 --> 02:45:50.507
I'M NOT GIVING UP ON A

02:45:50.573 --> 02:45:51.441
LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION TO THIS

02:45:51.508 --> 02:45:52.375
CRISIS WE KNOW THERE'S A BALLOT

02:45:52.442 --> 02:45:53.943
MEASURE OUT THERE AS WELL-

02:45:54.010 --> 02:45:57.580
THAT. DID YOU KNOW. THAT IS

02:45:57.647 --> 02:46:00.317
THERE. ARE NONE. I KNOW THAT

02:46:00.383 --> 02:46:02.085
THEY DID SOME OF OUR SUPPORTERS

02:46:02.152 --> 02:46:03.486
ARE LESS OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN

02:46:03.553 --> 02:46:04.321
GET A MEANINGFUL BILL THROUGH

02:46:04.387 --> 02:46:06.156
BOTH HOUSES I'M NOT. YOU KNOW

02:46:06.222 --> 02:46:06.756
THE I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE

02:46:06.823 --> 02:46:08.291
PUTTING THEIR- THEIR ENERGY

02:46:08.358 --> 02:46:09.459
INTO THE BALLOT MEASURE AND

02:46:09.526 --> 02:46:11.328
THAT STILL MAY BE WHERE THIS

02:46:11.394 --> 02:46:13.129
GOES BUT- BUT I ACTUALLY THINK

02:46:13.196 --> 02:46:14.431
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE THE

02:46:14.497 --> 02:46:16.433
LEGISLATURE TO STEP UP. AND

02:46:16.499 --> 02:46:17.701
DONE COME UP WITH OUR OWN

02:46:17.767 --> 02:46:20.670
SOLUTIONS AND THAT WE CAN WORK

02:46:20.737 --> 02:46:24.174
WITH THE MODIFY. SO ARE ANY HOW

02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:25.575
THE BALLOT MEASURE IS PENDING

02:46:25.642 --> 02:46:26.076
BEFORE COUNTY ELECTION

02:46:26.142 --> 02:46:27.911
OFFICIALS BUT- YOU KNOW ALL ALL

02:46:27.977 --> 02:46:29.312
APPEARANCES SEEM SUGGEST THAT

02:46:29.379 --> 02:46:31.314
IT'S GOING TO QUALIFY. IT'S MY

02:46:31.381 --> 02:46:33.249
SINCERE HOPE THAT THROUGH OUR

02:46:33.316 --> 02:46:34.918
DISCUSSIONS WITH LEGISLATORS

02:46:34.984 --> 02:46:35.785
STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE WILL BE

02:46:35.852 --> 02:46:36.886
ABLE TO CRAFT A COMPREHENSIVE

02:46:36.953 --> 02:46:38.888
FROM PROGRAM THAT. ACHIEVES ARE

02:46:38.955 --> 02:46:40.090
ARE THREE GOALS A BILL THAT

02:46:40.156 --> 02:46:41.891
WILL BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH. TO

02:46:41.958 --> 02:46:43.059
ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY

02:46:43.126 --> 02:46:44.461
INDUSTRY BUT STRONG ENOUGH TO

02:46:44.527 --> 02:46:45.762
CONVINCE INITIATIVE PROPONENTS

02:46:45.829 --> 02:46:47.497
TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE. I'M

02:46:47.564 --> 02:46:50.033
CONFIDENT WE CAN DO THAT- WITH

02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:51.234
ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF

02:46:51.301 --> 02:46:53.036
THE BILL'S DEREK DOLPHY AND I

02:46:53.103 --> 02:46:53.636
WHICH WAS WITH THE LEAGUE OF

02:46:53.703 --> 02:46:54.938
CALIFORNIA CITIES THE LEAGUE

02:46:55.004 --> 02:46:56.206
AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE

02:46:56.272 --> 02:46:57.374
BEEN WITH US EVERY STEP OF THE

02:46:57.440 --> 02:46:58.308
WAY BECAUSE THEY- HAVE

02:46:58.375 --> 02:47:00.443
ALTERNATELY BEEN. DEALING WITH

02:47:00.510 --> 02:47:01.244
THE BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

02:47:01.311 --> 02:47:04.614
WASTE. AND IT ALSO JORDAN WELLS
