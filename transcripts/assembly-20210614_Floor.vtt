UNCERTAINTY OUR COMMUNITIES

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:31.308
HAVE ENDURED CHALLENGE AFTER

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.176

STATE BUDGET HAS TREMENDOUS

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.346
IMPLICATIONS THERE ARE

00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:38.148
PROPOSALS IN THIS BUDGET THAT

00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:39.883
ARE NECESSARY AND HAVE MERIT.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:41.718
INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:43.286
BROADBAND ELIMINATING DEBT

00:53:43.353 --> 00:53:44.354
INCURRED BY OUR SCHOOL

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:45.689
DISTRICTS SUPPORT FOR THE

00:53:45.755 --> 00:53:46.489
DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED

00:53:46.556 --> 00:53:49.159

THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. CERTAINLY

00:53:52.028 --> 00:53:52.696
THE BUDGET JEFF IN THE BAY AREA

00:53:52.762 --> 00:53:54.531
AND I OUR EGGS EXPERIENCING A

00:53:54.598 --> 00:53:56.666
BUDGET CYCLE UNLIKE ANY OTHER

00:53:56.733 --> 00:53:57.500
WE'VE SEEN IN OUR STATE'S

00:53:57.567 --> 00:53:59.502
HISTORY. AND I APPRECIATE THE

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:01.805
CIRCUMSTANCES AND PRESSURES

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:02.839
THAT HE HAS HAD TO NAVIGATE AND

00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:05.141
TO NAVIGATE. THE COLLEAGUES I

00:54:05.208 --> 00:54:09.012
HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS TO AB

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:11.081
ONE TWENTY EIGHT. TOO OFTEN. WE

00:54:11.147 --> 00:54:13.316
FALL INTO THE COMMON MENTALITY.

00:54:13.383 --> 00:54:15.285
TO EVALUATE PROGRAMS BASED ON

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:17.854
THE AMOUNT WE SPEND. INSTEAD OF

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:19.656
RESULTS OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING

00:54:19.723 --> 00:54:22.025
TO ACHIEVE. THIS BILL

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:24.094
ADMITTEDLY STILL LACKS

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.963
IMPORTANT DETAILS. DETAILS THAT

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.899
WILL DETERMINE WHETHER PROGRAMS

00:54:29.966 --> 00:54:32.836
WILL ACTUALLY WORK OR NOT. MANY

00:54:32.902 --> 00:54:33.370
WILL TOUT THE SIZE OF THIS

00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:36.539
BUDGET. OVERLOOKING THE NEED

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:38.074
FOR A VITAL STRUCTURAL REFORMS

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:40.076
TO CRITICAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:43.613
CURRENTLY IN EFFECTIVE. POURING

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.582
LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY INTO

00:54:45.649 --> 00:54:47.984
PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDAMENTALLY

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:50.086
FLAWED OR MISMANAGED IS A

00:54:50.153 --> 00:54:52.689
RECIPE FOR DISASTER. CREATING

00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:54.424
MORE PROGRAMS AND EXPANDING

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:56.393
ONGOING SERVICES WITH A ONE

00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:59.863
TIME DOLLARS. IS NOT SENSIBLE

00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:02.065
AND I THINK MANY WOULD AGREE

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.733
THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.436
CALIFORNIANS EXPECT US TO FIX

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:08.738
THE MANY BROKEN SYSTEMS IN OUR

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:10.507
STATE GOVERNMENT TO FOCUS

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:11.841
RESPONSIBLY ON THE CONTINUOUS

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.576
DANGERS OF CASH EVERY WILDFIRES

00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:15.478
AND NOW WORSENING DROUGHT AN

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:16.813
OUTDATED ENERGY GRID AND TO

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.881
HAVE A REAL AND THOUGHTFUL

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:20.383
DEBATE ON PERMANENT TAX RELIEF

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:21.418
FOR CALIFORNIANS TRYING TO

00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:23.987
FIGURE OUT. HOW TO LIVE AND

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:25.922
WORK IN OUR STATE WAY MEDIUM

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:28.591
HOME COST OVER SEVEN HUNDRED

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:30.627
THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN FACT WELL

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:31.995
I AND MANY OPPOSED TO TAX

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:33.997
INCREASES IN DEFERRALS OF

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.231
IMPORTANT TAX CREDITS MADE LAST

00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:37.367
YEAR. IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO

00:55:37.434 --> 00:55:39.202
LOOK AT I'M DOING THOSE ACTIONS

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:40.870
NOW THAT WE HAVE A DIFFERENT

00:55:40.937 --> 00:55:42.972
BUDGET OUTLOOK BUT THOSE TAX

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:46.242
INCREASES UNFORTUNATELY REMAIN.

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:47.877
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT OUR

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:50.080
STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM IS

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:53.149
FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN. THE EDT

00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:56.553
SYSTEM CANNOT FUNCTION WITH ANY

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:58.988
SEMBLANCE OF COMPETENCE IN

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:01.124
CALIFORNIA HAS INCURRED A DEBT

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:03.526
OF TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:04.561
IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

00:56:04.627 --> 00:56:07.497
FUND. A DEBT THAT IF IT IS NOT

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:09.532
ADDRESSED IN A SIGNIFICANT AND

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:11.768
SUBSTANTIAL WAY WILL LEAD TO

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:16.139
HIGHER TAXES PAID FOR AND BY

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:16.706
ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING SMALL

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:19.109
BUSINESSES. LESTAT WAS INCURRED

00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:20.977
BECAUSE OF THE MISMANAGEMENT OF

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:23.179
STATE GOVERNMENT NOT BY OUR

00:56:23.246 --> 00:56:24.814
LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES. THE

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:27.050
LACK OF ACTION WILL ONLY LEAD

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:29.085
TO A LARGER TAX BURDEN THAT

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:31.020
HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS WILL

00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:32.088
HAVE TO BEAR IN THE FUTURE.

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:35.859
THIS IS UNDENIABLE. CALIFORNIA

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:38.394
IS FACING A SEVERE DROUGHT IN

00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:39.062
OUR WATER SUPPLY IS QUICKLY

00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:40.897
DWINDLING. FOLSOM LAKE FOR

00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:42.632
EXAMPLE HASN'T SEEN WATER

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:46.069
LEVELS THIS LOW SINCE NINETEEN

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:46.803
SEVENTY SEVEN. THE STATE WATER

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.705
INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRUMBLING AS

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:49.639
WE ENTER ANOTHER DROUGHT AND

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:53.943
FIRE SEASON. THIS BUDGET STILL

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.945
DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES

00:56:56.012 --> 00:56:58.515
OF NEEDED WATER STORAGE. WE

00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:01.785
HAVE SEEN THAT MORE SAVINGS IS

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:03.820
MORE PRUDENT THAN MORE SPENDING

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:05.321
BUT NEITHER THE GOVERNOR NOR

00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:07.190
THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL SEEKS

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:07.957
TO REPLENISH THE MONEY

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:08.725
WITHDRAWN FROM THE STATE'S

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:10.660
SAVING A SAVINGS ACCOUNT

00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:12.495
SOMETHING THAT WE MUST DO. THE

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:14.164
NONPARTISAN L. A. L. AS EVEN

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.966
TOLD US USING TOOLS DESIGNED

00:57:17.033 --> 00:57:19.302
FOR A BUDGET CRISIS TO SUPPORT

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:21.437
STATE SPENDING AT THIS TIME IS

00:57:21.504 --> 00:57:24.874
SHORT SIGHTED AND IT INVIOLABLE.

00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:25.975
MEMBERS I WOULD ARGUE THAT

00:57:26.042 --> 00:57:27.744
INSTEAD OF USING THE BUDGETS

00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:29.779
FRAMEWORK THIS BUDGET FRAMEWORK

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:32.081
AS A SPENDING SPREE. WE NEED TO

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:34.017
EVALUATE THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL

00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:35.885
AS FUTURE PROPOSALS AS A

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:38.421
MANAGEMENT PLAN. JUDGED BY

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:41.591
RESULTS AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:43.126
HAVE SEEN THE VOLATILITY AND

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:45.328
UNCERTAINTY IN BUDGET

00:57:45.395 --> 00:57:48.064
PROJECTIONS LOOKS CAN BE

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:51.401
DECEIVING THIS BUDGET IS LARGE

00:57:51.467 --> 00:57:53.503
BUT THERE ARE SERIOUS CONCERNS

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:54.871
THAT THIS BUDGET IS

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:57.307
UNSUSTAINABLE WE NEED TO FOCUS

00:57:57.373 --> 00:57:59.042
ON THE BASICS AND DEMAND

00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:00.743
RESULTS BEFORE WE POUR BILLIONS

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:03.313
OF DOLLARS. OF PRECIOUS TAX

00:58:03.379 --> 00:58:05.815
DOLLARS INTO MORE NEW PROGRAMS

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:08.284
AND A BROKEN SYSTEMS WITH NO

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:10.053
STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND FOR THAT

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:12.188
REASON I CANNOT SUPPORT THE

00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:14.624
PATH THAT THIS BUDGET LEADS OUR

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:19.495
STATE DOWN. URGENT ABOUT. THANK

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:21.164
YOU MR FONG MISS CLARK SILVA.

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:23.900
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:27.136
MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS MEMBERS

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:32.514
DRAMATICALLY EXPANDS THE SCOPE

OF GOVERNMENT WITH NEW PROGRAMS

01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:36.118

MAKING CALIFORNIA UNAFFORDABLE

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:17.593
TO SO MANY. WE SHOULD BE

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:20.329
FOCUSED ON PREPARING FOR

01:13:20.395 --> 01:13:22.564
POSSIBLE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. IF

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:23.999
IN THE FUTURE WE SHOULD PAY

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.868

ELDERLY. THOSE LIVING WITH

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.410

MY COLLEAGUES WHO SAID THIS

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:11.914
BUDGET IS A LOT OF THOSE THINGS

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.916
AND IN INCREDIBLE WAYS IT MOVES

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:15.450
THE BALL FORWARD ON

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:16.718
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN FOR

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.453

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.155
THOSE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:21.323
IT FOCUSES ON SOLVING OUR

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:23.826
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS I THINK ALL

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:24.593

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.628

THAT'S A SPOT FALSE NOT TRUE

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:33.041
OUR RESERVE IN THIS BUDGET IS

FOR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS FROM

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:11.806
EARLY EDUCATION THE AMOUNT OF

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:13.575
MONEY WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD. IS

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.043
UNFATHOMABLE TO BE LOOK AT

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:17.078
