IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:14.360 region:rollup2
CHEAPER THAN THE GLASS THAT IS

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:16.028 region:rollup2
BEING PURCHASED BY MANUFACTURES

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.463 region:rollup2

OUR INDUSTRY HAS BEEN A LEADER

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.966 region:rollup2
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

INCREASING ARE RECYCLED CONTENT.

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:38.190 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THE

00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:42.194 region:rollup2
ARBITRARY NUMBER THAT WAS JUST

ANY DATA OR A REAL RESEARCH --

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:49.869 region:rollup2

THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD

CONSIDER HOLDING THE BILL TODAY.

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:17.396 region:rollup2
WHEN THE BILL WAS GUIDED AND

00:23:15.461 --> 00:23:18.898 region:rollup2

MANUFACTURERS TO DETERMINE IF

00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:53.132 region:rollup2
THIS DATE COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:55.301 region:rollup2
IS IS REALLY UNREASONABLE --

00:23:53.132 --> 00:23:57.937 region:rollup2
BASED ON TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

00:23:55.301 --> 00:24:00.005 region:rollup2

THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:09.515 region:rollup2
NUMBER WOULD GO UP TO A HUNDRED

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.517 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTEEN MILLION POUNDS.

00:24:09.515 --> 00:24:13.652 region:rollup2

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:26.265 region:rollup2
POUNDS OF FOOD GRADE.

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:28.467 region:rollup2
BOB OUR P. T. THAT IS ONE THIRD

00:24:26.265 --> 00:24:30.836 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WOULD CONSUME A THIRD

OF THE NATIONAL RPG THAT'S

00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:34.406 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR FOOD GRADE AND I

00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:35.975 region:rollup2
KNOW THE PROPONENTS SAY A WE

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:36.475 region:rollup2
HAVE PLENTY.

00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:37.743 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:39.678 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

00:24:37.743 --> 00:24:41.914 region:rollup2
OUR PET THAT IS NOT FOOD GRADE

00:24:39.678 --> 00:24:43.682 region:rollup2
THERE'S PLENTY OF NON FOOD GRADE

00:24:41.914 --> 00:24:45.584 region:rollup2
OUR PET AVAILABLE ABOUT ONE

00:24:43.682 --> 00:24:47.052 region:rollup2
POINT TWO BILLION TIMES OF OF OF

THAT AND ACCOUNTS OF THAT

00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:50.189 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.523 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS IT IS A LOT EXTRA WORK

00:24:50.189 --> 00:24:53.792 region:rollup2
THAT A RECLAIMER HAS TO GO

00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:55.661 region:rollup2
THROUGH TO GET TO A FOOD GRADE

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:59.264 region:rollup2
LEVEL THAT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR THE

00:24:55.661 --> 00:25:00.899 region:rollup2
FDA TO ALLOW US TO RE USE IN

00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:02.334 region:rollup2
FOOD GREAT PRODUCTS.

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:04.536 region:rollup2
I CALIFORNIA LEE KRAMER SAY THEY

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:06.672 region:rollup2
CAN MEET THIS GOAL BUT THEY THEY

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:08.440 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT DONE ANY STEPS TO SURE

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:10.476 region:rollup2
ASSURE US THAT THE FDA

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.944 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS COULD BE COMPLIED

00:25:10.476 --> 00:25:12.478 region:rollup2
WITH -- THE

00:25:11.944 --> 00:25:14.947 region:rollup2
ARBITRARY MAIN MANDATE CAN

00:25:12.478 --> 00:25:16.915 region:rollup2
CAUSE.

00:25:14.947 --> 00:25:18.183 region:rollup2
A SPIKE IN THE PRICES AND

00:25:16.915 --> 00:25:19.752 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:21.387 region:rollup2
PREVENT THEM FROM SETTING THE

00:25:19.752 --> 00:25:22.988 region:rollup2
PRICE IT ANY ABOUT THEY WANT

00:25:21.387 --> 00:25:24.023 region:rollup2
WITH THIS MANDATE THERE.

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:26.158 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY GET THE

00:25:24.023 --> 00:25:29.428 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL [inaudible]

00:25:26.158 --> 00:25:31.397 region:rollup2
BUDGET A PMDEEP PAYMENTS AND SO

00:25:29.428 --> 00:25:33.565 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO US THAT THERE'S AN

00:25:31.397 --> 00:25:35.134 region:rollup2
UNJUST ENRICHMENT HERE --

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:36.702 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ONE OF OUR SMALL

00:25:35.134 --> 00:25:38.337 region:rollup2
BOTTLERS IN THE MODESTO AREA

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:40.172 region:rollup2
BARNEY BROTHERS WHO SENT A

LETTER TO THE ASSEMBLY YESTERDAY

00:25:40.172 --> 00:25:44.643 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS THE LIFE.

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:45.244 region:rollup2
CYCLE OF THEIR BEVERAGES IS FROM

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:47.679 region:rollup2
FIVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AND

00:25:45.244 --> 00:25:49.148 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:50.249 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR COMPANY TO PULL THE

00:25:49.148 --> 00:25:51.950 region:rollup2
UNEXPIRED.

00:25:50.249 --> 00:25:53.986 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS EXISTING PRODUCTS FROM

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.821 region:rollup2
THE SHELVES ON BY THE DEADLINE

00:25:53.986 --> 00:25:56.789 region:rollup2
THAT'S PROPOSED IN TWENTY YOU

00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:58.323 region:rollup2
KNOW FOR THE JANUARY TWENTY

00:25:56.789 --> 00:26:00.392 region:rollup2
TWENTY DEADLINE.

00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:02.127 region:rollup2
THERE'S CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:04.263 region:rollup2
THAT TALKS ABOUT THE THEIR EACH

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:05.964 region:rollup2
BOTTLE HAS TO HAVE 20%.

00:26:04.263 --> 00:26:07.866 region:rollup2
OR THERE'S A MONTHLY AVERAGE

00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:09.568 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT CLEAR EVEN FROM THE

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:12.371 region:rollup2
EXACT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL.

00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:13.906 region:rollup2
ANOTHER MIGHT BIG ISSUE IS MANY

00:26:12.371 --> 00:26:15.641 region:rollup2
OF THE BOTTLERS IN CALIFORNIA

00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:16.842 region:rollup2
DON'T MAKE THEIR OWN CONTAINERS

00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:17.342 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO

00:26:16.842 --> 00:26:19.711 region:rollup2
CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF

00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:21.213 region:rollup2
PERJURY.

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:22.414 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE THAT AMOUNT IN

00:26:21.213 --> 00:26:24.049 region:rollup2
THEIR CONTAINERS WHEN THEY ARE

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:25.384 region:rollup2
NOT THE ONES THAT PRODUCE IT

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:27.119 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH A

00:26:25.384 --> 00:26:28.454 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMPANY BUT THEY ARE

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:30.622 region:rollup2
NOT THE ONE THAT PRODUCE IT.

00:26:28.454 --> 00:26:32.391 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THE PENALTIES ARE NOT

TESTIFYING THAT CAME UP I'M JUST

00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:12.651 region:rollup2
CURIOUS AS TO WHERE THAT OTHER

00:29:09.915 --> 00:29:13.285 region:rollup2
CAME FROM AND AND THEN AND I

00:29:12.651 --> 00:29:14.286 region:rollup2
DON'T THE SURE IF THERE WAS A

00:29:13.285 --> 00:29:15.887 region:rollup2
SOFT A STUDY BUT I KNOW IT WAS

00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:17.222 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY WAS COMING UP.

00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:17.889 region:rollup2
THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY WAS

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:20.392 region:rollup2
COMING UP WITH THAT NUMBER RIGHT

00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:21.460 region:rollup2
IN THE BUT NOT BUT NOBODY IN ON

00:29:20.392 --> 00:29:22.394 region:rollup2
THE OTHER SIDE THE MANUFACTURING

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.830 region:rollup2
SIDE THAT THAT THAT MEMBERS

00:29:22.394 --> 00:29:25.330 region:rollup2
COUNCIL THEY HAVEN'T SAID HEY WE

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:29.401 region:rollup2

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:30.569 region:rollup2
AND A NUMBER SO THIS. FOR MY

00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:32.037 region:rollup2
WORDS NOT YOURS BUT THIS SEEMS A

00:29:30.569 --> 00:29:33.905 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ARBITRARY IN THE

00:29:32.037 --> 00:29:36.074 region:rollup2
SENSE THAT.

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:37.709 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY HAS TESTIFIED THAT THEY

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:39.378 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ABLE TO TO

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:41.280 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IN TERMS

00:29:39.378 --> 00:29:42.814 region:rollup2
OF OF THAT PART OF IT SO AT THAT

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.783 region:rollup2
DOES CONCERN ME A LITTLE BIT.

00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:47.319 region:rollup2
BUT I I'LL I'LL MOVE ON BRIT

00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:47.953 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY WHAT ABOUT THE ARM.

00:29:47.319 --> 00:29:50.055 region:rollup2
THE BEVERAGE CANS ALSO MENTIONED

00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:52.057 region:rollup2
--

00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:53.225 region:rollup2
THAT THE CONTENT AVERAGE IT IF

00:29:52.057 --> 00:29:54.793 region:rollup2
IT IS THAT BIG IN THE BILL

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:56.728 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I COULDN'T REALLY.

00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:58.697 region:rollup2
FIND A HEART OF A FIRM NUMBER

00:29:56.728 --> 00:30:00.032 region:rollup2
THERE IS IT PER BOTTLE IS IT.

00:29:58.697 --> 00:30:01.199 region:rollup2
CAN WE AVERAGED IT WHAT WHAT

00:30:00.032 --> 00:30:02.501 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE.

00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:05.070 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS IS

00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:06.405 region:rollup2
AVERAGE --

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.140 region:rollup2
SO IT IS AN AVERAGE AMOUNT

00:30:06.405 --> 00:30:09.508 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.444 region:rollup2
IS ALREADY REPORTING TO CAL

00:30:09.508 --> 00:30:14.112 region:rollup2
RECYCLE THE VOLUME OF VIRGIN AND

00:30:12.444 --> 00:30:16.748 region:rollup2
THE VOLUME OF RECYCLED

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:18.684 region:rollup2
THE THIS BILL ASSUMES THAT SAME

00:30:16.748 --> 00:30:20.352 region:rollup2
MEASURE ON SO WE KNOW FOR

00:30:18.684 --> 00:30:22.954 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE PEPSI COLA IS

00:30:20.352 --> 00:30:24.256 region:rollup2
ALREADY DOING 21% ON AVERAGE WE

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:25.857 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT NESTLE IS ALREADY

00:30:24.256 --> 00:30:27.526 region:rollup2
DOING 42%.

00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:29.594 region:rollup2
ON AVERAGE THIS BILL IS

00:30:27.526 --> 00:30:30.829 region:rollup2
INCORPORATING THAT SAME CONCEPT

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:33.098 region:rollup2
WHICH IS AN EXISTING LAW OF A

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:33.765 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE --

00:30:33.098 --> 00:30:37.869 region:rollup2
THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY REPORTING.

00:30:33.765 --> 00:30:40.539 region:rollup2
AND THE CAL RECYCLE CERTIFYING

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:42.708 region:rollup2
BASED ON AB SO SO TO CLARIFY FOR

00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:44.209 region:rollup2
FROM MY MY MY SMALL BRAIN HERE

00:30:42.708 --> 00:30:46.178 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW.

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:47.779 region:rollup2
AN INDUSTRY AVERAGE THEN COMPANY

00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:49.348 region:rollup2
OUR COMPANY COMPANY AB AVERAGE

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:50.982 region:rollup2
OKAY COMPANY AS A EACH COMPANY

00:30:49.348 --> 00:30:52.150 region:rollup2
HAS TO COMPLY SO IT DOESN'T

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:54.753 region:rollup2
MATTER IF IT'S MONTHLY WEEKLY

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.254 region:rollup2
THAT WE COME ANNUALLY NOW OR

ASSIDUOUS CURRENTLY WE'RE GOING

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:06.932 region:rollup2
OKAY THAT'S WHAT I WAS.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:08.266 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET AT SO THAT IT THAT

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:59.344 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHEN THE PROPONENTS OWN

00:37:57.142 --> 00:38:01.212 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL REFLECTS A DISCHARGE

00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:01.813 region:rollup2
RATE OF ABOUT.

00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:03.314 region:rollup2
FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PRE

00:38:01.813 --> 00:38:05.283 region:rollup2
YEARS AGAINST TO RECHARGE RATE

00:38:03.314 --> 00:38:06.885 region:rollup2
OF ABOUT THIRTY TWO THOUSAND

00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:09.320 region:rollup2
FEET PRE HERE.

00:38:06.885 --> 00:38:11.322 region:rollup2
I BEGAN TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.557 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:13.658 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

00:38:12.557 --> 00:38:14.859 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY ABDICATED ITS

00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:17.796 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:19.531 region:rollup2
PUBLIC LANDS IN THE MOJAVE.

00:38:17.796 --> 00:38:21.432 region:rollup2
THROUGH WHAT TYPICALLY WOULD

00:38:19.531 --> 00:38:22.300 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN A NEPA PROCESS.

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:24.536 region:rollup2
I THINK THE STATE HAS A

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.803 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE OF THE

00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:27.639 region:rollup2
REVIEW THAT WAS ORIGINALLY

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:28.740 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO TAKE PLACE BY THE

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:30.909 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:32.911 region:rollup2
IS COMPLETED BEFORE AUTHORIZING

00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:34.846 region:rollup2
A PROJECT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL

00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:37.982 region:rollup2
TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT.

00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:39.417 region:rollup2
SUCH A FRAGILE ECO.

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:40.952 region:rollup2
FURTHERMORE CONSIDERING THE

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:42.921 region:rollup2
CONFLICTING ESTIMATES ON THE

00:38:40.952 --> 00:38:44.989 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF WATER THAT CAN BE

00:38:42.921 --> 00:38:46.658 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLY EXTRACTED.

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:49.294 region:rollup2
WELL AS PROVIDED THE KIDDIES THE

00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:50.628 region:rollup2
PROJECTS APPLICANTS AND OTHER OF

00:38:49.294 --> 00:38:53.231 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS IN THE FEDERAL

00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:55.033 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT'S OWN FIGURES --

00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:57.001 region:rollup2
FRANKLY IN MY OPINION THE STATE

00:38:55.033 --> 00:38:59.971 region:rollup2
MUST CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT

00:38:57.001 --> 00:39:02.140 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS. FOR AND

00:38:59.971 --> 00:39:03.041 region:rollup2
ALSO TO RESOLVE THE SCIENTIFIC A

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.943 region:rollup2
CONFLICT THE CONFLICT BETWEEN

00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:07.145 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS.

00:39:04.943 --> 00:39:08.546 region:rollup2
BEFORE ALLOWING THE EXTRACTION

00:39:07.145 --> 00:39:11.716 region:rollup2
OF WATER FROM THIS --

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:12.684 region:rollup2
DESERT TO UPPER.

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:14.586 region:rollup2
FOR NOW.

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:16.588 region:rollup2
I'M NOT TRYING TO PREVENT THE

00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:18.156 region:rollup2
PUMPING OF WATER FROM THIS SOCK

00:39:16.588 --> 00:39:19.490 region:rollup2
FOR HIM TO BE CLEAR ON THAT.

00:39:18.156 --> 00:39:22.327 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE MUST ENSURE THAT

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:24.229 region:rollup2
THE SCIENTIFIC REVIEW IS

00:39:22.327 --> 00:39:26.297 region:rollup2
COMPLETED AND THAT THE SCIENCES

00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:26.831 region:rollup2
RECONCILED.

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:28.633 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AN

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:30.468 region:rollup2
INFORMED DECISION ABOUT WHETHER

00:39:28.633 --> 00:39:32.237 region:rollup2
THIS OR ANY SIMILAR EXTRACTION

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:33.404 region:rollup2
PROJECT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD.

00:39:32.237 --> 00:39:34.872 region:rollup2
NOW WE CAN AND WE SHOULD DO IT

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:37.675 region:rollup2
QUICKLY.

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:39.611 region:rollup2
BUT WE MUST DO IT.

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:41.346 region:rollup2
I THINK AT THIS POINT OF I WILL

00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:43.514 region:rollup2
TURN THE MIKE OVER MICROPHONE

00:39:41.346 --> 00:39:45.350 region:rollup2
OVER TO MY A CO AUTHOR.

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:46.784 region:rollup2
SIMPLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. FOR HER

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:48.519 region:rollup2
COMMENTS WITH YOUR PERMISSION

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:49.854 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR YES PLEASE THANK

EXCELLENT JOB SUMMING UP.

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:54.993 region:rollup2
OUR POSITION --

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:56.394 region:rollup2
WE ARE FRANKLY US SITTING HERE

00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:57.528 region:rollup2
AGNOSTIC AS TO HOW MUCH WATER

00:39:56.394 --> 00:40:00.331 region:rollup2
CAN SAFELY BE DRAWN OUT OF THIS

00:39:57.528 --> 00:40:01.666 region:rollup2
BASIN BUT GIVEN THAT ARE DESERT

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:03.868 region:rollup2
IS VERY PRECIOUS.

00:40:01.666 --> 00:40:05.036 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT COVERED UNDER SIGMA

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:06.804 region:rollup2
WE'RE ONLY GOING TO GET THE

00:40:05.036 --> 00:40:08.072 region:rollup2
CHANCE TO GET THIS RIGHT ONCE WE

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:10.408 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT ONCE OP OFFERS ARE

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:12.777 region:rollup2
OVERDRAWN THEY DO NOT RECOVER.

00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:14.879 region:rollup2
AND THIS THIS OP OR FOR IS THE

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:16.314 region:rollup2
PRIMARY SOURCE OF WATER FOR ALL

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:18.182 region:rollup2
REFERRED ARE.

00:40:16.314 --> 00:40:20.251 region:rollup2
MOJAVE NATIONAL RESERVE AND LOTS

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:21.085 region:rollup2
OF OTHER PROTECTED LANDS SO WE

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.753 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.787 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO.

00:40:21.753 --> 00:40:23.321 region:rollup2
AND GIVEN THAT THERE IS A

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:25.056 region:rollup2
DISPUTE BETWEEN A FEDERAL

00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:26.824 region:rollup2
AGENCY.

00:40:25.056 --> 00:40:28.126 region:rollup2
ARM AND THIS FEDERAL

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:30.094 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION AND THE PREVIOUS

00:40:28.126 --> 00:40:31.562 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:33.331 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF RECHARGE IN THE BASIN

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:34.532 region:rollup2
AND GIVEN THE CHANGING HYDROLOGY

00:40:33.331 --> 00:40:35.867 region:rollup2
IN THE DISTRICT BECAUSE OF

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:36.901 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:40:35.867 --> 00:40:39.370 region:rollup2
I DO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE'S

00:40:36.901 --> 00:40:40.605 region:rollup2
ROLE IS TO HELP TO RECONCILE

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.407 region:rollup2
THOSE NUMBERS AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:43.574 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IS DRAWN IS SAFE FOR

00:40:42.407 --> 00:40:44.208 region:rollup2
THE AREA.

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:45.643 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE OUR TOP PRIORITY

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:47.011 region:rollup2
--

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:48.980 region:rollup2
TIRED THIS BILL I THINK IS A

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:50.815 region:rollup2
VERY REASONABLE STEP TO ENSURE

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.550 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE HAS A ROLE TO

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:53.851 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THE VOTE AQUIFER

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.520 region:rollup2
IS NOT OVERDRAWN.

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:58.122 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.957 region:rollup2
AN AYE VOTE.

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:38.997 region:rollup2
WORTHY OF CONTINUED INVESTMENT.

00:41:37.195 --> 00:41:40.231 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WORKED WITH GENERATIONS

DRIVE OF THE ASSASSINATIONS.

00:42:21.939 --> 00:42:24.742 region:rollup2
BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SEEKS

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:26.878 region:rollup2
TO PILLAGE WHAT WE HAVE BUILT UP

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:28.312 region:rollup2
OVER GENERATIONS.

00:42:26.878 --> 00:42:29.313 region:rollup2

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:34.052 region:rollup2
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:36.020 region:rollup2
REQUIRED THIS PROJECT UNDER BOTH

00:42:34.052 --> 00:42:37.088 region:rollup2
FEDERAL NEPA REVIEW.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.356 region:rollup2
BUT THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN

00:42:37.088 --> 00:42:40.124 region:rollup2
EVENTS RATED BY THE CURRENT

00:42:38.356 --> 00:42:41.592 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND THE

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:43.428 region:rollup2
PROJECT WILL NOW ESCAPE THE

FEDERAL RIVER REVIEW THAT HAS

00:42:43.428 --> 00:42:46.230 region:rollup2
BEEN REQUIRED SINCE THE PROJECT

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:48.032 region:rollup2
WAS FIRST PROPOSED TWENTY YEARS

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:49.534 region:rollup2
AGO.

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:51.536 region:rollup2
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

00:42:49.534 --> 00:42:53.071 region:rollup2
REMOVAL OF THE GOAL POST.

00:42:51.536 --> 00:42:54.772 region:rollup2
COULD THESE WILL NOT BE SUBJECT

00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:56.407 region:rollup2
TO REVIEW BY FEDERAL SCIENTISTS

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:59.210 region:rollup2
AT THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE.

00:42:56.407 --> 00:43:00.511 region:rollup2

THE SCIENTIFIC AGENCIES CAME

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.753 region:rollup2
CAME TO FIND MUCH DIFFERENT

00:43:07.185 --> 00:43:10.755 region:rollup2
RECHARGE RATES THAN WHAT THE

00:43:08.753 --> 00:43:12.723 region:rollup2

00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:15.193 region:rollup2
BY THE USGS IS UP FINDINGS THE

FIVE TIMES MORE WATER.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.564 region:rollup2
THAN IT'S RECHARGED.

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:21.265 region:rollup2
THERE MUST BE BOUNDARIES TO

00:43:19.564 --> 00:43:23.201 region:rollup2
POLITICAL EXPEDIENCE AND

RESTORES ORDER.

00:43:26.137 --> 00:43:29.006 region:rollup2
IN SCIENCE BASED DECISION MAKING

00:43:27.572 --> 00:43:31.342 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE USED FOR DECADES TO

AQUIFER BY PUMPING.

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:54.325 region:rollup2
FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:56.861 region:rollup2
GROUND WATER EVERY FOR FIFTY

00:44:54.325 --> 00:44:59.030 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:44:56.861 --> 00:45:02.133 region:rollup2
THAT SIXTEEN BILLION GALLONS OF

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:04.769 region:rollup2
WATER WORTH FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:45:02.133 --> 00:45:06.737 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE GALLONS PER SECOND.

00:45:04.769 --> 00:45:08.239 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT IS UNSUSTAINABLE

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:10.908 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO PUMP MORE

00:45:08.239 --> 00:45:12.777 region:rollup2
WATER FROM THE AQUIFER THEN IS

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:14.679 region:rollup2
REPLACE NATURALLY.

00:45:12.777 --> 00:45:16.447 region:rollup2
A IN WITHIN THE WATERSHED AND AS

00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:17.949 region:rollup2
ALREADY NOTED THE ESTIMATES FROM

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:19.784 region:rollup2
THE U. U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY

00:45:17.949 --> 00:45:21.085 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT THE RAIN AND SNOW

WITHIN THE AQUIFER'S WATERSHED

00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:24.822 region:rollup2
UNIT.

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:25.723 region:rollup2

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:27.225 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND ACRE

00:45:25.723 --> 00:45:28.893 region:rollup2
FEET PER YEAR.

00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:29.827 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO THE FIFTY THOUSAND

00:45:28.893 --> 00:45:31.629 region:rollup2
ACRE FEET THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING

00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:33.598 region:rollup2
TO UP PUMP OUT.

00:45:31.629 --> 00:45:34.231 region:rollup2
A THIS IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONLY

00:45:33.598 --> 00:45:35.800 region:rollup2
FIVE AND 25% OF WHAT HE'S SAYING

00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:37.368 region:rollup2
--

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.070 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA POP.

00:45:37.368 --> 00:45:40.104 region:rollup2
THE RESULT OF THE UNSUSTAINABLE

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:42.273 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER MINING WILL MEAN

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:43.741 region:rollup2
THAT THE WATER TABLE IS GOING TO

00:45:42.273 --> 00:45:45.476 region:rollup2
DROP IN THIS AREA.

00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:47.211 region:rollup2
AND THAT WILL DRY UP THE SPRINGS

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:49.180 region:rollup2
AND IT ALSO KILL OFF ALL OF THE

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:50.548 region:rollup2
TREES AND VEGETATION AND THAT

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.083 region:rollup2
THE ROOTS STONES THAT GO DOWN

00:45:50.548 --> 00:45:54.251 region:rollup2
WITH THIS WATER TABLE.

00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:54.852 region:rollup2
AND THE PROJECT ITSELF SAYS IT'S

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:55.853 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE DROPPING THE WATER

00:45:54.852 --> 00:45:57.855 region:rollup2
TABLE --

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:59.323 region:rollup2
THEY'VE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS WE'VE

00:45:57.855 --> 00:46:01.192 region:rollup2
SEEN THIS KIND OF BROWN WATER

00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:02.627 region:rollup2
MINING OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN

00:46:01.192 --> 00:46:03.728 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK

00:46:02.627 --> 00:46:04.962 region:rollup2
TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO SEE

00:46:03.728 --> 00:46:06.097 region:rollup2
WHAT THE EFFECTS ARE.

00:46:04.962 --> 00:46:08.833 region:rollup2
A SEVERELY OVER DRAFTING AN

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:10.534 region:rollup2
AQUIFER.

00:46:08.833 --> 00:46:12.670 region:rollup2
THESE IMPACTS WILL BE MORE

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:13.871 region:rollup2
SEVERE WITH IN THE DESERT.

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:15.706 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE ANNUAL

00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:17.375 region:rollup2
RAINFALL IS ABOUT TWO AND A HALF

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:18.776 region:rollup2
INCHES PER YEAR.

00:46:17.375 --> 00:46:20.344 region:rollup2
AND YESTERDAY CALIFORNIA

00:46:18.776 --> 00:46:21.646 region:rollup2
RELEASED ITS FOURTH CLIMATE

00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:24.181 region:rollup2
CHANGE ASSESSMENT.

00:46:21.646 --> 00:46:25.249 region:rollup2
WHICH SAID THAT BASICALLY THE

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:27.051 region:rollup2
DESERT IS ONLY GOING TO BECOME

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:29.086 region:rollup2
HOTTER AND DRIER WHICH MEANS

00:46:27.051 --> 00:46:30.521 region:rollup2
THESE TYPES OF WATER SOURCES ARE

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:32.223 region:rollup2
ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE AND

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:33.958 region:rollup2
MORE CRITICAL.

00:46:32.223 --> 00:46:34.959 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE IT

00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:37.061 region:rollup2
CLEAR OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:38.462 region:rollup2
YEARS THAT THE TIME OF DRAINING

00:46:37.061 --> 00:46:40.364 region:rollup2
OUR AQUIFER'S UNSUSTAINABLY IS

GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT.

00:46:45.603 --> 00:46:48.339 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WE MUST BE MANAGING

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:50.107 region:rollup2
OUR WATER SOURCES MORE

00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:51.709 region:rollup2

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:57.661 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL AGENCIES DIDN'T

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:59.096 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE ORIGINALLY I

00:54:57.661 --> 00:54:59.897 region:rollup2
OUR PROCESS.

00:54:59.096 --> 00:55:01.899 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE A

00:54:59.897 --> 00:55:02.800 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT THE PASSAGE OF SB

00:55:01.899 --> 00:55:03.400 region:rollup2
ONE TWENTY WILL HAVE THE EFFECT

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.235 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING THE CREDIBILITY OF

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.303 region:rollup2
SEQUEL.

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:07.838 region:rollup2
US EAGLE REVIEWS IF OPPONENTS

00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:08.338 region:rollup2
CAN GET ANOTHER BITE AT THE

00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:09.673 region:rollup2
APPLE WITH THIS KIND OF

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:11.008 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:11.842 region:rollup2
THE LAST MINUTE GOTTEN AMEND

00:55:11.008 --> 00:55:13.010 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO THIS AND OTHER

00:55:11.842 --> 00:55:14.912 region:rollup2
ISSUES IS IN OUR VIEW AT THE

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:16.180 region:rollup2
VERY LEAST NOT APPROPRIATE.

00:55:14.912 --> 00:55:17.147 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THE COULD HAVE THIS

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.182 region:rollup2
KIND OF IMPACT SHOULD GO THROUGH

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:19.082 region:rollup2
THE REGULAR OF LEGISLATIVE

00:55:18.182 --> 00:55:20.951 region:rollup2
PROCESS NEVER THE LAST.

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:22.219 region:rollup2
HERE WE ARE.

00:55:20.951 --> 00:55:23.987 region:rollup2
OUR PRIMARY CONCERN TODAY IS

00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:25.656 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS F. B. ONE TWENTY

00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:26.990 region:rollup2
PASSES NEITHER THIS PROJECT NOR

00:55:25.656 --> 00:55:28.492 region:rollup2
ANY PROJECT SUBJECT TO SEQUEL

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:29.626 region:rollup2
WILL BE SAFE FROM AFTER THE FACT

00:55:28.492 --> 00:55:31.228 region:rollup2
LAST MINUTE INTRUSIONS INTO THE

00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:32.296 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:55:31.228 --> 00:55:32.863 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE SECRET

00:55:32.296 --> 00:55:34.131 region:rollup2
PROCESS IT WAS APPROVED AND

00:55:32.863 --> 00:55:35.966 region:rollup2
LITIGATED.

00:55:34.131 --> 00:55:36.733 region:rollup2
YIELDING RECHARGE WE MONITOR TO

00:55:35.966 --> 00:55:38.402 region:rollup2
CONTROL BUT THE COUNTY OF SAN

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:40.204 region:rollup2
PORTANTINO WAS RESPONSIBLE

00:55:38.402 --> 00:55:41.672 region:rollup2
AGENCY UNDER THEIR PLAN.

00:55:40.204 --> 00:55:42.873 region:rollup2
THIS BILL TODAY IS NOT ABOUT

00:55:41.672 --> 00:55:44.341 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE ALL THE TEES WERE

00:55:42.873 --> 00:55:46.376 region:rollup2
CROSSED AND I'S WERE DOTTED THIS

00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:47.878 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT MOVING THE FINISH LINE.

00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:48.478 region:rollup2
WE URGE TO STOP THIS BILL NOT

00:55:47.878 --> 00:55:50.113 region:rollup2
ONLY BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ON

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:51.448 region:rollup2
THIS PROJECT.

00:55:50.113 --> 00:55:52.249 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE LONG TERM HARM WE

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:53.417 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT WILL COST TO THE

00:55:52.249 --> 00:55:55.419 region:rollup2
CREDIBILITY THE IMPORTANT

00:55:53.417 --> 00:55:57.588 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS AND

00:55:55.419 --> 00:55:58.488 region:rollup2
FUTURE LAWFUL SEQUEL REVIEWS.

00:55:57.588 --> 00:56:02.693 region:rollup2
WE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU

00:55:58.488 --> 00:56:04.261 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

AT LIKE TO YIELD THE BALANCE OF

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:10.334 region:rollup2
MY TIME TO LESLIE MOULTON WHO --

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:12.536 region:rollup2
PROVIDED THE SEQUINED ALICE'S

00:56:10.334 --> 00:56:14.438 region:rollup2
AND CAN INFORM THE COMMITTEE ON

00:56:12.536 --> 00:56:15.839 region:rollup2
JUST TO THE EXTENT OF THE

00:56:14.438 --> 00:56:17.507 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE.

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:19.476 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:20.944 region:rollup2
IMPACT REPORT BUT ON THE GROUND

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:22.279 region:rollup2
WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN AND I

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:23.347 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO PUT ONE THING IN

00:56:22.279 --> 00:56:25.782 region:rollup2
CONTEXT.

00:56:23.347 --> 00:56:27.384 region:rollup2
THIS PROJECT AS A JACK TO

00:56:25.782 --> 00:56:29.019 region:rollup2
WITHDRAW FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE

00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:30.454 region:rollup2
FEET OF WATER A YEAR.

00:56:29.019 --> 00:56:32.789 region:rollup2
BUT TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT THERE'S

00:56:30.454 --> 00:56:34.124 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIRTY MILLION ACRE FEET

00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:35.525 region:rollup2
THAT UNDER LAYS.

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:37.361 region:rollup2
THE BASIN THIS WAS DONE IN A

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:38.095 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE

00:56:37.361 --> 00:56:41.198 region:rollup2
MANNER.

00:56:38.095 --> 00:56:42.099 region:rollup2
WE URGE YOU KNOW ABOUT.

00:56:41.198 --> 00:56:43.734 region:rollup2
LESLIE MORTON POST WITH

00:56:42.099 --> 00:56:45.035 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATES

00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:46.603 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT AND C. E. O. WHEN I

00:56:45.035 --> 00:56:48.138 region:rollup2
WAS THE PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE

00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:49.506 region:rollup2
SECRET PROCESS FOR THE KIDDIES

00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:50.474 region:rollup2
WATER PROJECT.

00:56:49.506 --> 00:56:52.109 region:rollup2
AND I THINK I JUST WANT TO HIT

00:56:50.474 --> 00:56:53.910 region:rollup2
ON TWO POINTS AND THEN CERTAINLY

00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:54.544 region:rollup2
BE AVAILABLE.

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.946 region:rollup2
FOR ON QUESTION SHOULD YOU HAVE

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:57.381 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:56:55.946 --> 00:56:58.749 region:rollup2
ON THE QUESTION OF PROCESS THAT

00:56:57.381 --> 00:57:00.017 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN ADDRESS THERE'S A

00:56:58.749 --> 00:57:01.985 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT THIS HASN'T GONE

00:57:00.017 --> 00:57:03.287 region:rollup2
THROUGH A THOROUGH STATE PROCESS

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:04.488 region:rollup2
BUT OF COURSE IT DID GO THROUGH

00:57:03.287 --> 00:57:06.189 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL

00:57:04.488 --> 00:57:08.158 region:rollup2
QUALITY ACT PROCESS.

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:09.259 region:rollup2
WHICH TOOK ABOUT FOUR YEARS TO

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:12.863 region:rollup2
EXECUTE [inaudible]

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:14.464 region:rollup2
A A NUMBER OF AGENCIES FEDERAL

00:57:12.863 --> 00:57:16.500 region:rollup2
STATE LOCAL REGIONAL WERE

00:57:14.464 --> 00:57:17.834 region:rollup2
INVITED TO COMMENT DURING THE

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.202 region:rollup2
SCOPING PERIOD.

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:20.504 region:rollup2
OF INCLUDING THE STATE LANDS

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:22.272 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:57:20.504 --> 00:57:24.041 region:rollup2
FISH AND GAME STATE LANDS

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:25.575 region:rollup2
COMMISSION CHOSE NOTTO

00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:27.377 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE FISHING GAME DID

00:57:25.575 --> 00:57:28.578 region:rollup2
SUBMIT A LETTER AND ALSO.

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:30.280 region:rollup2
FURTHER SUBMITTED WHEN THEY DID

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:31.548 region:rollup2
REVIEW THE DRAFT HE AYE ARE A

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.383 region:rollup2
COMMENT LETTER.

00:57:31.548 --> 00:57:35.218 region:rollup2
OF THE BLM THE U. S. B. ARE THE

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:37.888 region:rollup2
U. S. G. S. AND THE NATIONAL

00:57:35.218 --> 00:57:39.222 region:rollup2
PARK SERVICE WERE ALL INVITED.

00:57:37.888 --> 00:57:41.658 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SEQUEL

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:43.427 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND SOME OF THEM DIDN'T

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:46.663 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEM DID NOT --

00:57:43.427 --> 00:57:48.298 region:rollup2
OVER A HUNDRED SIX INDIVIDUAL

00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:50.167 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AT THE STATE LOCAL

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:51.234 region:rollup2
FEDERAL REGIONAL LEVEL WERE

00:57:50.167 --> 00:57:53.136 region:rollup2
INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:55.238 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:56.773 region:rollup2
SO THERE WAS A LOT OF

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:58.041 region:rollup2
THOROUGHNESS AND PROCESS

00:57:56.773 --> 00:57:59.242 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY THAT OF COURSE IS

00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:01.645 region:rollup2
REQUIRED.

00:57:59.242 --> 00:58:03.146 region:rollup2
UNDER OUR STATE SECRET PROCESS.

00:58:01.645 --> 00:58:03.613 region:rollup2
AND I DO THINK THAT PROCESS

00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:06.283 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY IS EXTREMELY

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:08.452 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:58:06.283 --> 00:58:12.222 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTION OF

00:58:08.452 --> 00:58:14.157 region:rollup2
ON THE GROUND WATER RECHARGE --

00:58:12.222 --> 00:58:16.793 region:rollup2
DEBATE AND DIFFERENCES OF

00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:18.362 region:rollup2
OPINION AMONG EXPERTS.

00:58:16.793 --> 00:58:19.663 region:rollup2
THE E. I. R. TOOK --

00:58:18.362 --> 00:58:20.964 region:rollup2
I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT

00:58:19.663 --> 00:58:22.566 region:rollup2
THOROUGH AND CONSERVATIVE

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:23.867 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO LOOKING AT NOT ONLY

00:58:22.566 --> 00:58:26.169 region:rollup2
WHAT.

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:27.371 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT SPONSORS INFORMATION

00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:29.039 region:rollup2
SHOWED THAT THE RECHARGE WAIT

00:58:27.371 --> 00:58:30.040 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND

00:58:29.039 --> 00:58:32.342 region:rollup2
ACRE FEET PER YEAR.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.310 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO LOOKED AT SIXTEEN

00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:34.711 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR WHAT

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:36.279 region:rollup2
IF IT WAS HALF THAT.

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:38.248 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IF IT WAS ONLY FIVE

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:40.150 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR.

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:42.152 region:rollup2
IT IS DIFFICULT --

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:43.687 region:rollup2
TO HERE A CONTINUING REFERENCE

00:58:42.152 --> 00:58:47.691 region:rollup2
TO THE VERY EARLY STUDIES THAT

00:58:43.687 --> 00:58:48.258 region:rollup2
USGS DID THAT LANDED ON THE

00:58:47.691 --> 00:58:49.159 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:58:48.258 --> 00:58:51.128 region:rollup2
ACRE FEET PER YEAR.

00:58:49.159 --> 00:58:53.563 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH MORE

00:58:51.128 --> 00:58:55.565 region:rollup2
SITE SPECIFIC AND DETAILED

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:56.400 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AVAILABLE DONE UNDER

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:58.602 region:rollup2
THIS --

00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.570 region:rollup2
PROJECTS STUDIES SEVERAL YEARS

00:58:58.602 --> 00:59:02.606 region:rollup2
OF SITE SPECIFIC GROUNDWATER

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.640 region:rollup2
MONEY MONITORING.

00:59:02.606 --> 00:59:06.143 region:rollup2
WELL MONITORING TO GET REAL

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:07.511 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCALITY.

00:59:06.143 --> 00:59:09.379 region:rollup2
A COMPLETELY NEW GROUNDWATER

00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:09.913 region:rollup2
MODEL TO UPDATE AND HELP PROVIDE

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:11.948 region:rollup2
A MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED

00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:13.216 region:rollup2
ANSWER.

00:59:11.948 --> 00:59:14.651 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS AVAILABLE THROUGH

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:17.454 region:rollup2
THE E. AYE OUR PROCESS FOR

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:18.855 region:rollup2
CRITIQUE AND REVIEW --

00:59:17.454 --> 00:59:20.223 region:rollup2
SO THE E. AYE ARE WITH AN

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:22.959 region:rollup2
ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION TRIED TO

00:59:20.223 --> 00:59:25.062 region:rollup2
LOOK AT SEVERAL SCENARIOS OF

00:59:22.959 --> 00:59:27.230 region:rollup2
WHAT IF THERE IS A A DIFFERENT

00:59:25.062 --> 00:59:30.400 region:rollup2
RECHARGE RATE [inaudible]

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:32.135 region:rollup2
AND MITIGATED FOR THOSE THAT

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.936 region:rollup2
IMPACTS AND A PERSON SPOKE

00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:34.738 region:rollup2
EARLIER AND SAID YOU KNOW THE

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:36.373 region:rollup2
ISSUE IS GROUNDWATER PUMPING

00:59:34.738 --> 00:59:38.508 region:rollup2
WILL DRAW DOWN THE GROUNDWATER

00:59:36.373 --> 00:59:40.644 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THE CHIEF.

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:42.612 region:rollup2
AGENT OF IMPACT INTO GROUNDWATER

00:59:40.644 --> 00:59:44.214 region:rollup2
PUMPING SCENARIO SO.

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:45.582 region:rollup2
WE TOOK A LOOK AT UNDER ALL

00:59:44.214 --> 00:59:48.485 region:rollup2
THOSE DIFFERENT A RECHARGE

00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:49.119 region:rollup2
SCENARIOS THE FIVE THOUSAND THE

00:59:48.485 --> 00:59:50.420 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN THOUSAND AND THIRTY TWO

00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:51.555 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ACRE FEET.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.056 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD THE LEVEL OF DRAWDOWN

00:59:51.555 --> 00:59:55.625 region:rollup2
BE?

00:59:53.056 --> 00:59:57.227 region:rollup2
AND WE FOUND THAT AT THIRTY TWO

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:58.962 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ACRE FEET.

00:59:57.227 --> 00:59:59.930 region:rollup2
RECHARGE ASSUMPTION THAT THE

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:01.364 region:rollup2
PROJECT SPONSOR BELIEVES IS

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:03.300 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:05.035 region:rollup2
THE DRAWDOWN WOULD NOT EXCEED

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.937 region:rollup2
MORE THAN EIGHTY FEET OVER THE

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:08.071 region:rollup2
LIFE OF THE PROJECT AND THAT

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:10.140 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:11.875 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.009 region:rollup2
SO THE COUNTY CAME IN AND UNDER

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:14.578 region:rollup2
THERE ARE GROUND WATER

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:16.046 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE IN AN

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:09.525 region:rollup2
WORKERS WANT JOBS AND DOWN WHERE

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:11.661 region:rollup2
I COME FROM AGENCIES WHAT WATER.

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:12.628 region:rollup2
AND I WANT ALL THOSE THINGS TOO

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:13.896 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT THEM IN ASSISTING

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:16.265 region:rollup2
NOBLE WAY.

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:17.867 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:19.902 region:rollup2
CAN'T DETERMINE WHAT TO DO WITH

01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:22.505 region:rollup2
THE RECHARGE RATE OF THIS BASIN%

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:24.040 region:rollup2
IS AND THE SCIENTISTS ALL AGREE.

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:26.776 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN'T DETERMINE WHAT THE

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:28.144 region:rollup2
DISCHARGE RATE COULD POSSIBLY BE

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:30.813 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A

01:12:28.144 --> 01:12:31.380 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE BASIS THIS AQUIFER

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:33.282 region:rollup2
UNDER A VERY VERY IMPORTANT

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:35.084 region:rollup2
PART.

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:36.852 region:rollup2
OF OUR STATE FOR GENERATIONS TO

01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:38.321 region:rollup2
COME BECAUSE THE AGENCIES THAT

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:40.723 region:rollup2
WILL TAKE THIS WATER.

01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:41.958 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PIPELINE WE'RE GOING

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:43.593 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF THEM ANYWAY HERE

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:45.161 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE USING IT TO ENTITLE

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:47.396 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:48.798 region:rollup2
AND HOOK UP WATER METERS AND IF

01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:50.166 region:rollup2
YOU BUILD A HOUSE AND YOU HOOK

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:51.634 region:rollup2
UP A WATER METER AND YOU

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:52.869 region:rollup2
PROMISED THE RESIDENTS THAT

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:54.303 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO GET WATER.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:56.839 region:rollup2
THEN THE SOURCE OF THE WATER

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:59.208 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE SUSTAINABLE.

01:12:56.839 --> 01:13:02.078 region:rollup2
SO HAVING SAID ALL THAT I WILL

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:03.179 region:rollup2
ALSO SAY IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:04.780 region:rollup2
DURING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:06.616 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:09.385 region:rollup2
IN COURT THE SCIENCE WAS NOT

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:10.920 region:rollup2
LITIGATED.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.455 region:rollup2
THE SELECTION OF THE LEAD AGENCY

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.589 region:rollup2
WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES THERE WERE

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:15.391 region:rollup2
SEVERAL OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:16.425 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE PROCEDURAL ISSUES THAT

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.526 region:rollup2
WERE LITIGATED BUT IT'S MY

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:19.462 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING.

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:21.831 region:rollup2
THAT THE SCIENCE ITSELF WAS NOT

01:13:19.462 --> 01:13:23.599 region:rollup2
LITIGATED IN COURT THERE WAS NO

01:13:21.831 --> 01:13:25.268 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION AND LITIGATION

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:26.836 region:rollup2
OVER WHICH REPORT --

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:28.137 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE RELIED ON AND WHY

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:29.639 region:rollup2
OTHERS SHOULD NOT AT LEAST

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:31.140 region:rollup2
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:32.742 region:rollup2
E. AYE OUR PROCESS.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.176 region:rollup2
OTHERS CAN CORRECT ME BUT

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:36.312 region:rollup2
WHETHER WAS YOUR WASN'T THE FACT

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:38.047 region:rollup2
REMAINS.

01:13:36.312 --> 01:13:39.749 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE SCIENTISTS THAT

01:13:38.047 --> 01:13:42.652 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY DISAGREE.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:44.253 region:rollup2
AND TO MAKE AN ERROR ON THIS. TO

01:13:42.652 --> 01:13:46.122 region:rollup2
MAKE AN AIR ON THIS IF WE GET IT

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:48.591 region:rollup2
WRONG.

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:49.859 region:rollup2
WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE?

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.827 region:rollup2
FOR SO I SAY HIT THE PAUSE

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:53.062 region:rollup2
BUTTON.

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:55.364 region:rollup2
TAKE A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

01:13:53.062 --> 01:13:57.333 region:rollup2
HOWEVER SHORT FIGURE OUT THIS

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:58.968 region:rollup2
SCIENCE RECONCILE THE SCIENCE

01:13:57.333 --> 01:14:01.170 region:rollup2
DETERMINE A DISCHARGE RATE IN A

01:13:58.968 --> 01:14:01.671 region:rollup2
RESEARCH RESEARCH RECHARGE RATE

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:04.006 region:rollup2
IT'S REASONABLE FOR THIS

01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:05.941 region:rollup2
AQUIFER.

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:07.276 region:rollup2

THE AQUIFER.

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:12.281 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO IT

01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:13.816 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND WE DO IT IN A

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:17.653 region:rollup2
