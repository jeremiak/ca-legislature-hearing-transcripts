THEY GET ARRESTED THEY HAVE

00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:54.038
HOSPITALIZATIONS THEY MAY NEED

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:58.076
HE ALSO ENGAGE IN A PRESS FOR

00:32:58.142 --> 00:32:58.710
ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND THIS IS A

00:32:58.776 --> 00:33:00.678
REVOLVING DOOR PATTERN FOR THEM

00:33:00.745 --> 00:33:02.447
BASED ON RESEARCH THIS KIND OF

00:33:02.513 --> 00:33:03.881
PROGRAM SHOWS YOU CAN GET VERY

00:33:03.948 --> 00:33:05.283
GOOD OUTCOMES UNDER TWO

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.285
CONDITIONS. ONE IS THAT IF YOU

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:09.120
TREAT PEOPLE PSYCHOTIC

00:33:09.187 --> 00:33:11.089
DISORDERS THAT'S ONE UP FOR AT

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:12.590
LEAST SIX MONTHS YOU CAN REDUCE

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:14.826
HOSPITALIZATIONS WRAPS

00:33:14.892 --> 00:33:18.162
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE VIOLENCE-

00:33:18.229 --> 00:33:20.932
THEY ALSO RETAIN STABLE HOUSING

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:21.599
IN AN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:23.634
PROGRAM I'M PROBABLY JUST AS

00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:24.869
IMPORTANT AS ANYTHING ELSE IF

00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:28.406
NOT MORE SO BEAR MEDICATION

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:31.109
COMPLIANCE. IN THE PROGRAM THE

00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:33.544
STATUTE HAS SUBSTANTIAL

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:37.849
PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS- THESE

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:41.219
INDIVIDUALS OFTEN FACE A CHOICE

00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:42.520
WHEN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT

00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:44.055
TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE IT'S AN

00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:46.924
ALTERNATIVE TO JAIL POSSIBLY

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.860
PRISON BUT CERTAINLY JAIL OR

00:33:48.926 --> 00:33:51.629
HOSPITALIZATION IT IS A COURT

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:54.432
SUPERVISED PROGRAM IS A SAD- IN

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:55.967
THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING

00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:58.102
ONCE YOU'RE DONE WITH THE COURT

00:33:58.169 --> 00:33:59.470
PROCESS YOU GET TO GO HOME AND

SLEEP IN YOUR OWN BED AT NIGHT

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:02.273
IT IS A COMMUNITY BASED

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.009

HAD HOPED FOR AFTER ALL THE

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:10.928
GOAL OF MOORE'S LAW IS NOT TO
