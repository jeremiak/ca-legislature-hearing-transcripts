AND SO -- HOW IT REALLY CAME TO

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:44.583
THIS WAS THAT WE WOULD SEE

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.018
OFTENTIMES IN THE WORK WE WERE

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:47.486
DOING LOOKING AT THE COST OF

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:48.587
READ MISSIONS?

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:50.122
MORTALITY -- HOSPITALIZATIONS

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:52.692

VISITS TO PHYSICIANS WE OFTEN

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.661
SEE THAT MET MUCH OF THAT WAS

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:56.462
DUE TO OPTIMISE.

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:57.096
MEDICATIONS NOT BEING OPTIMIZE

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.831
SO REALLY NOT BEING BUILT

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:01.334
EXACTLY FOR PURPOSE TO REGION

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.102
ACHIEVABLE CLINICAL GOAL THEIR

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:04.337
PRESCRIBED MEDICATION BUT WASN'T

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:08.007
EXACTLY IDEALIZED TO PREVENT.

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:09.709
FURTHER FOLLOW UP OR PREVENT

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:10.343
FURTHER SICKNESS.

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:11.344
AND SO WE WOULD OFTEN SEE THAT

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.511
THE THE COSTA REPORTED ON THIS

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:13.679
NATIONALLY WERE IN THE

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:15.214
NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWO HUNDRED

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.316
NINETY BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR.

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:18.617
WE OFTEN SAW THAT NUMBER

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:20.953
REPORTED ROUTINELY THAT THE COST

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.854
OF THIS NOT OPTIMIZED

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.255
MEDICATIONS ARE NOT GETTING THE

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:25.558
MEDICATIONS BILL FOR THE PURPOSE

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:27.760
OF OF MEETING THE GLOBAL GOAL

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:29.028
WAS COSTING CLOSE THREE BILLION

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:29.862
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:31.564
BUT THAT WAS BASED ON TWO

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.432
THOUSAND AND EIGHT NUMBERS AND A

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:34.800
LOT OF HAPPENED SINCE TWO

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:35.534
THOUSAND EIGHT INCLUDE.

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:38.137
EXPANSION OF MEDICARE PART D.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:39.472
CHANGES IN A CA INCREASING THE

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:41.007
COST AND IN GENERAL WITH WITH

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:42.775
MEDICAL COSTS AS WELL AS

00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:43.776
MEDICATION COST.

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:45.411
SO WE CHOSE TO UPDATE THAT USING

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.179
MORE VALID SOURCES AND LOOKING

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:49.648
AT IF WE COULD GET A BETTER READ

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:51.117
ON THE CURRENT COSTS.

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:51.984
AND WE DID THAT THE ESTIMATE

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:53.919
TURNED INTO FIVE OR TWETY EIGHT

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.688
POINT FOUR BILLION OLLARS.

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:58.157
ANNUALLY FOR THE COST OF THIS

00:10:58.224 --> 00:10:59.725
NON OPTIMIZE MEDICATION IN THE

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:00.760
UNITED STATES WHICH EQUATES TO

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:02.428
ABOUT 16%.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.130
OF TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:05.731
UNITED STATES SO REALLY AMOUNTS

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:06.999
TO A WE FOUND THIS NUMBER

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:08.501
UPDATED AND WHAT WE COULD DO

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:09.635
ABOUT THAT.

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:11.137
PART OF THAT WAS EXPANSION TO

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:13.406
LOOKING AT ONE SOLUTION WAS

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:14.673
COMPREHENSIVE MEDICATION

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.142
MANAGEMENT WHICH WE DETAIL.

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:19.545
IN THAT -- PAPER AS A POTENTIAL

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:20.980
SOLUTION AND WE'RE SEEING THAT

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:27.720
THERE REALLY IS SOME SOME

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.088
STRIDES TO COULD BE MADE IF WE

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:30.089
IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY AND

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:31.557
SCALE UP.

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:33.859
OF THIS MODEL OF I THINK THAT

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:34.960
WE'VE THERE'S BEEN OUT SOME OF

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.062
THE REPORTS ABOUT THE THE

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:38.364
LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THAT

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:38.964
PRESCRIBES ARE ABLE TO SPEND.

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.733
SPA SPEAKING WITH THEIR PATIENTS

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.267
I THINK THERE'S A REASON

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:42.068
ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT TWENTY SIX

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:43.669
SECONDS IS SPENT ON DISCUSSING.

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:44.804
THE EVIDENCE BASED PORTIONS OF A

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.839
NEW MEDICATION WITH A PATIENT

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:48.441
AND TWENTY SIX SECONDS A LOT TO

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:49.909
THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:51.277
TO TALK ABOUT A MEDICATION THEY

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:52.611
BE BE ON FOR THE REST OF THEIR

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:53.145
LIVES.

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:54.213
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE FOUR TIMES

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.281
LONGER THAN A MINUTE SPEAK TODAY

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:57.116
AND SO REALLY THINKING ABOUT WE

00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:58.484
COULD DO MORE AND THERE IS THE

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.986
AVAILABILITY OF DOING THIS IS IS

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:02.321
AT OUR DISPOSAL WE JUST HAVE TO

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:03.823
FIND A BETTER WAY.

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.225
OF DEPLOYING PHARMACISTS TO MEET

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:08.427
THIS OAL WHICH IS BECOMING I

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:09.728
THINK MORE MORE PORTENT AS OUR

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:14.233
POPULATION AGES AND COST ONLY GO

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:14.400

00:30:36.367 --> 00:30:38.002
IN THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO WE HAVE

00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:38.603
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.338
CITIES BUT WE HAVE CITIES THAT

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:45.276
AND AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:46.911
COUNTY DOES NOT SEE THAT WE HAVE

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:48.213
THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:50.315

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:55.653
KNOWN COOPER SPEND PROGRAM AND

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.921
WE THINK THAT SHOULD BE CHANGED

00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:59.090
OTHERWISE WE AGREE WITH A LOT OF

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:01.593
THE OTHER -- CLEAN UP FROM TO

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:04.262
LAST YEAR'S PROPOSALS.

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:05.063
MANAGER DAVEY JOHNSON TO HAVE

ONE OF THOSE SMALL CITIES THAT

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:07.165
DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM

00:31:07.232 --> 00:31:09.300
WITH THIS BILL SOUTH PASADENA --

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:11.736
HE HAS -- BEEN VERY VERY

00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:13.504
CONCERNED ABOUT THE PREEMPTION

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.306
AND THE ABILITY OF THE COUNTY TO

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:16.608
MAKE THE DECISION FOR ALL

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:18.209
ELECTED OFFICIALS AND HAVE THEM

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:20.411
HAVE NO SAY IN WHAT'S GOING TO

00:31:20.478 --> 00:31:21.813
HAPPEN IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS --

00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:23.314
THEY'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED

00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:25.216
ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH -- QUé A

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:26.751
RISK AND THEY THINK THAT THIS

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:28.319
DECISION IS RIGHT WE LEFT WITH

00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:29.487
THE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT ARE

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:30.855
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE AND

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:32.156
HAVING THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:34.192
MAKE THE DECISION FOR ALL EIGHTY

00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:34.626
EIGHT CITIES.

00:31:34.692 --> 00:31:35.460
WE THINK IS AN OVERREACH WE

00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:37.262
THINK THERE'S ANOTHER WAY THAT

00:31:37.328 --> 00:31:38.162
THE COUNTY IF THEY WANTED TO

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:40.164
OFTEN THEY CAN OPT IN AND HAVE A

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:40.965
DOUBLE LOCKED IN.

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:41.599
SO THE COUNTY COULD OPT IN AND

00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:42.667
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO BE THE

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:43.768
HEALTH OFFICER FOR THE COUNTY OF

00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:45.303
LOS ANGELES IN THOSE CITIES THAT

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:46.537
WANTED TO JOIN THEM AND OPTING

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:47.672
IN COULD ALLOW THOSE BUSINESSES

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:48.906
IN THOSE LOCATIONS.

00:31:48.973 --> 00:31:50.441
THAT IS A WAY THAT WOULD WE

00:31:50.508 --> 00:31:51.376
WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT

00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:52.510
BILL -- BUT THE BILL'S IS

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:53.778
