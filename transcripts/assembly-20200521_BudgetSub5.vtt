00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:20.865
SURE THAT THIS IS DONE

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:23.501
PROPERLY. SIMILARLY WITH THE

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:25.470
PROPOSAL TO CLOSE PRESENCE I'M

00:33:25.536 --> 00:33:27.171
ALL FOR SHRINKING THE SIZE OF

00:33:27.238 --> 00:33:28.773
OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.775
BUT I'M INTERESTED TO SEE THE

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.343
PROPOSED PLAN INCLUDING

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.745
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR LABOR

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:35.680

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:37.582
SOME PLACES WHERE I WAS NOT A

00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:40.051

BACK INTO THE GENERAL FUND. WAS

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.332
CONCERNING TO ME. FOR THE LAST

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:56.267
TWO YEARS THE LEGISLATURE ANY

YOUTH. IN LIEU OF INCARCERATION

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:03.541
WITH A PRIORITY. IT MAKES

00:34:03.608 --> 00:34:05.243
ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE TO ME THAT

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:06.277
IN A YEAR WHERE WE ARE

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:08.780
PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE. STATE

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.314
INCARCERATION OF YOUTH WOULD

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:12.784
ALSO CUT THE VERSION FUNDING.

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:14.218
THESE FUNDS KEEP YOUTH OUT OF

00:34:14.285 --> 00:34:16.354
PRISONS. WHICH REPRESENTS

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:16.921
SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS TO THE

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:19.090
STATE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY.

00:34:19.157 --> 00:34:20.992
INVEST IN OUR YOUTH WITH

00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:24.095
HEALTH. EDUCATION CAREER AND

00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:26.297

THIS YEAR. I STRONGLY SUPPORT A

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:40.011
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET. THAT

00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:41.913
RETURNS THESE CRITICAL FUNDS

00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:44.949

JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMMING.

BRIEFLY I DIDN'T KNOW IF NOW IS

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:41.906
THE BEST TIME OR AFTER THE

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:42.940
PRESENTATION BUT I'LL JUST MAKE

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:44.075
A COUPLE COMMENTS ON AREAS THAT

00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:46.010
I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS

00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:47.778
COMMITTEE FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:49.814
WITH RESPECT TO THE JUDICIAL

00:35:49.881 --> 00:35:53.050
BRANCH BUDGET I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:54.185
THE SIGNIFICANT CUTS THAT ARE

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:56.087
THERE AND NOT BUT I LOOK AT THE

00:35:56.153 --> 00:35:58.656
MODERNIZATION FUNDS AND I KNOW

00:35:58.723 --> 00:36:01.025
THIS IS BEEN A LONG DESIRE OF

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:03.528
THE- CHIEF JUSTICE AND JUDICIAL

00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:05.329
COUNCIL BUT I JUST CAN'T HELP

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:06.464
BUT THINK THAT GIVEN THE

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:08.866
SACRIFICE THAT. WERE MAKING

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:10.401
ACROSS THE BOARD THAT

00:36:10.468 --> 00:36:12.270
PRESERVING SOME OF THOSE MONIES

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:13.804
INSTEAD OF HOLDING OFF ON SOME

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:15.506
OF THAT MODERNIZATION. AND

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:17.708
SPENDING IT ON. ATTACKING

00:36:17.775 --> 00:36:19.710
ACCESS TO JUSTICE THROUGH LEGAL

00:36:19.777 --> 00:36:21.979
SERVICES WOULD BE PROBABLY

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:23.247
BETTER SERVED AT THIS POINT IN

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:25.182
TIME. AND THE SECOND COMMENT IS

00:36:25.249 --> 00:36:27.552
WITH RESPECT TO DJJ WE'VE BEEN

00:36:27.618 --> 00:36:28.386
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION FOR

00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:30.121
QUITE SOME TIME ABOUT MOVING

00:36:30.187 --> 00:36:31.789
AWAY FROM DJJ GIVING MORE

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:33.858
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTIES.

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:36.327
SO WHAT I WAS VERY INTERESTED

00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:38.729
IN THE PROPOSAL. THAT'S IN THIS

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.665
BUDGET. AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN

00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:42.166
BUILT AROUND SAVING SOME MONEY

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:45.403
AND THAT'S FINE. BUT AS WE SAID

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:46.771
THIS ESPONSIBILITY TO THE

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:48.472
COUNTIES WHICH I AGREE WITH

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:49.140
THAT I TRUST OUR PROBATION

00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:50.975
CHIEFS TO. MANAGE THIS

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.544
APPROPRIATELY. THERE ARE SOME

00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:57.582
PROGRAMMING. OPTIONS THAT DJJ

00:36:57.648 --> 00:37:00.084
HAS HAD THAT I WOULD HATE TO

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:01.218
LOSE TO THIS PROCESS AND SO

00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:02.687
WHAT THAT MEANS IS I THINK THE

00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:05.089
STATE NEEDS TO KEEP. INVOLVED

00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:06.657
WITH WHAT HAPPENS AT THE COUNTY

00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:08.225
LEVEL AND WITH DESPERATE

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:09.760
RESOURCES AND DISPARATE PUBLIC

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.395
POLITICAL WILL IN OUR VARIOUS

00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:13.598
COUNTIES. I WOULD HATE IF WE

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:15.466
SET UP A SITUATION WHERE THE

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:18.169
SUCCESS OF A KID IF OF A CHILD.

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:20.137
IN OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:21.672
NOW BEING RUN BY THE COUNTIES

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:23.174
WOULD DEPEND ON WHICH COUNTY

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.109
THEIR RED SO THE STATE WILL

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:27.345
HAVE A CONTINUING ROLE. IN

00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:30.982
MANAGING. OUTCOMES FOR KIDS AT

00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:32.883
THE COUNTY LEVELS AND ENSURING

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:35.286
THAT THAT ALL KIDS IN WHATEVER

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:37.254
COUNTY THERE IN HAVE ACCESS TO

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:38.556
BASIC MINIMUM TYPES OF

00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:41.058
PROGRAMS. THAT HELP THEM TO NOT

00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:42.293
RECIDIVIST THAT HELP THEM GET

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.061
BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY AND

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:46.397
THAT WE THAT WE THEN SUPPORT

00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:48.232
THE VARIOUS. PROBATION

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:49.300
DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:51.235
COUNTY IN THAT WAY TO SUPPORT

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:53.938
THAT MOVE. BUT WITH A QUESTION

00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:55.506
AS WITH EVERYTHING THAT DOUBLE

00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:57.742

IMPLEMENTATION AND HOW THAT

00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:00.244
GETS IMPLEMENTED AND I WANT TO

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:01.312

CLOSURE ARE IDENTIFIED. THIS

00:54:24.794 --> 00:54:27.197
WOULD ALSO GIVE THE LEGISLATURE

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:29.265
MORE TIME TO ASSESS THE IMPACT

00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:31.534

THE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:35.472
ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

DISCHARGE PROCESS. THESE

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.328
CHANGES WOULD REDUCE THE PAROLE

00:54:58.395 --> 00:55:00.864

FUTURE YEARS- WE KNOW THAT THIS

00:55:12.542 --> 00:55:14.377
PROPOSAL WOULD FOCUS RESOURCES

ON THE TIME PERIOD IN PAROLE

00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:18.415

ACHIEVE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:31.795
FURTHER SAVINGS IF IT WAS

00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:33.630

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:34.698
OF THE OTHER SAVINGS THAT

TO DJJ WHILE THESE CHANGES ONLY

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.364
CREATE ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF

ONE. THE ACTUAL CLOSURE OF DJJ

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:48.271

IN FUTURE YEARS. WE WOULD

00:56:50.373 --> 00:56:51.775
RECOMMEND APPROVING THIS

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:53.176

JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AT THE

TO KNOW RESPECT TO CBC OURS

00:58:21.297 --> 00:58:23.099
BUDGET THAT IN VERY IS IT IT IS

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:24.500
NOT ACCOUNT THE LAFAYETTE OF

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:26.803
KOBE NIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE CALL

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.838
LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:31.674
GOVERNOR IMPLEMENTED AT THE

00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:34.677
INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE

00:58:34.744 --> 00:58:37.847
DISORDER TREATMENT PRO I'M- IS

00:58:37.914 --> 00:58:39.148
A VERY LARGE EXPANSION IN THE

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:41.517
BILL. HEALTH PROGRAMS IN THE

00:58:41.584 --> 00:58:42.752

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:43.586
ONE MAY DOLLARS BETWEEN NOW. TO

AND THE BUDGET YEAR THE NAY

00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:47.023
REVISION INCLUDES THIS NINETY

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:47.991
ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO STOP

00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:49.626
DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANY OF

DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. GIVEN

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:56.299
THIS WE THINK IT'S UNLIKELY

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.667
THAT THE FULL NINETY ONE

00:58:57.734 --> 00:58:58.301
MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE

00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:00.303
NECESSARY AND RECOMMEND A MORE

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.405
MODEST EXPANSION OF ONLY FORTY

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:03.539
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH

00:59:03.606 --> 00:59:05.041
WOULD CREATE FORTY FIVE MILLION

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:07.343
DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. IN ADDITION

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:09.112
THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:10.246
FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ABOVE

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:12.115
THE ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION

00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:13.549
DOLLAR BASE BUDGET FOR MEDICAL

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:16.019
GUARDING AND TRANSPORTATION-

00:59:16.085 --> 00:59:18.221
HOWEVER AGAIN DUE TO VISIT

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:19.789
SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:22.492
WITHIN THE PRISONS THERE- FEWER

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:24.260
MEDICAL TRANSPORTS OUTSIDE OF

PRISONS IN WITHIN PRISONS AND

00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:26.963
SO E THINK IT'S LIKELY THAT

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:28.231
SOME OR ALL OF THAT FOURTEEN

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:30.833

CASELOAD ADJUSTMENTS ON THESE

ACCOUNT FOR CODE NINETEEN

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:45.648
ACCORDINGLY WE'D RECOMMEND THE

PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISION

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:12.141
RELATED TO PUBLIC SAFETY- WE

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.143
WOULD NOTE THAT THE MAI

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.411

PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:30.994
ENABLE IT TO DO SO THE MAY

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.528
REVISION ELIMINATES THIS

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:34.330
FUNDING WHICH WOULD LIKELY

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:35.832
LIMIT THE ABILITY OF THE O. I.

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.367

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:03.393
AS THESE COSTS WILL BE OFFSET

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:05.128
BY FUTURE SAVINGS ARE GIVEN THE

STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION WE

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:07.897
RECOMMEND THAT THIS TWELVE

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.988
ACROSS VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS ON

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:40.656
THE NOTE THAT I DO HAVE FOR

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:41.891
COLLEAGUES IN THE ROOM WITH ME

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:43.693

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:49.699

YEAH. ELIO WITH LOW ABOUT THE

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:54.871
COMMITTEE POWERS FUNDING I

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:57.507
WOULD AGREE THAT LAST YEAR'S A

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:58.741
BUDGET ACT DID- REQUIRE

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:01.310
REPORTING ON HOW THE FUNDING

01:03:01.377 --> 01:03:04.046
WAS SPENT- WE'RE FINE WITH THAT

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:06.015
REQUIREMENT. BUT WE ARE OPPOSED

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:07.884
TO ADOPTING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:09.852

HOW THE FUNDING WILL BE SPLIT

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:15.291
AND USED. I THINK WE LEARNED

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.026
FROM LAST YEAR IS THAT IT'S

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.694
DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH ANY

01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:21.631
LEVEL OF ACCURACY AND ADVANCE

01:03:21.697 --> 01:03:22.999

ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL SHE

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:29.272
TRIES TO STRIKE A BALANCE

FLEXIBILITY SO THAT SPENDING

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.346
CAN DECISIONS CAN BE MADE IN

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:38.481
THE REAL TIME BASED ON THE

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:40.216
CONDITIONS THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:43.653
EXPERIENCE SO WE ARE OPPOSED TO

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:44.787
HAVING ANYTHING TOO

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:46.989
PRESCRIPTIVE- HAPPY TO CONTINUE

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:48.591

IS RELATED TO PROVIDE NINETEEN.

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:01.270
ALL OF THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:02.371
STRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:03.839

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:16.459
CRITICAL AREAS AS RECOMMENDED

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:18.360
BY THE AUDIO COULD INHIBIT THE

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:19.662
STATE'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:21.664

ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF THE

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:42.351
MAY REVISION- I THINK WE HAVE-

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:46.388
OF ISSUES THAT I HAD ACTUALLY

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:48.257
DONE A FIGHT ABOUT THE ISSUES

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:50.159
THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND I

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:52.127
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:54.830
ARE TALKING ABOUT- THE ISSUE OF

01:08:54.897 --> 01:08:56.599
WHICH WE'VE DONE FOR. A NUMBER

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:58.634
OF YEARS THE ISSUE OF CLOSING

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.503
PRISONS. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:01.337
THIS PROCESS FOR THE LAST

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:03.339
COUPLE YEARS. AND HAVE ASKED

01:09:03.405 --> 01:09:06.575
FOR A PLAN. FROM CDC ARE. A

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.277
PRIORITY PLAN WE'VE SAID WE

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.245
DIDN'T WANT TO DO MAJOR

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:11.213
CONSTRUCTION OUR RENOVATIONS IF

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.815
WE DIDN'T KNOW. WHAT PRISON WAS

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:14.884
GOING TO BE CLOSED DOWN. AND WE

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:16.285
HAVE YET TO GET A PLAN WE HAVE

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:18.120
YET TO GET THE PRIORITY SO AND

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:19.455
TERMS OF. WHAT SHOULD BE THE

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:20.990
STANDARDS TO BE USED IN SO

01:09:21.056 --> 01:09:21.957
WE'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE PUTTING

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:23.959
TOGETHER. THE PRIORITIES FOR

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:26.095
YOU- TO HELP MAKE THIS DECISION

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:28.330
BUT WE HAVE YET TO SEE A PLAN.

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:30.633
OF FROM- FROM CDC ARE

01:09:30.699 --> 01:09:31.901
CONCERNING PRISON CLOSURES AND

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:32.801
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.670
EXTENSIVELY. BY LEASE FOR THE

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:36.605
LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS. AND NO

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:37.640
ONE HAS COME FORWARD WITH THE

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:39.542
PLAN SO THAT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM

01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:40.743
I THINK ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:42.511
TALKING ABOUT. A CAPITAL OUTLAY

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:44.046
AND THINGS THAT WE NEED TO

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.714
RESOURCES AND WE HAVE SAID VERY

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:47.683
CLEARLY. THE LAST THING WE WANT

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.184
TO DO IS PUT A BRAND NEW ROOF

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:50.252
ON A PRISON THAT WE TORE DOWN

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.520
SIX DOUBLE TEN OUT SIX MONTHS

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.355
LATER. AND HAVE THAT AS A PART

01:09:53.422 --> 01:09:55.090
OF THE USE OF RESOURCES ARE

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:56.058
REALLY THAT THE USE OF

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:59.261
RESOURCES SO- IT IS VERY

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:00.329
DIFFICULT FOR US TO. IN THE

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:01.797
PLEASE FOR ME PERSONALLY I

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.699
SHOULD SAY TO TRUST THE CDC

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:04.967
ARE. IS CAPABLE OF MAKING

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.535
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT CULTURE

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:08.203
PRESENCE BECAUSE- OF THEIR

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:09.572
VESTED INTEREST IN MAINTAINING

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:12.041
PRISONS. SO IT'S A IT'S A AND

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:13.409
THE ISSUE. WE SPENT A LOT OF

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:16.979
TIME. TALKING ABOUT. THE

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.847
INSPECTOR GENERAL. AIR AND THE

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:20.182
POSITION THAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:22.017
SOMEONE OVERSIGHT. AND WE

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.953
FUNDED IT TO HAVE OVERSIGHT. I

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:25.487
MEAN WHO BETTER TO TELL US

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:26.755
WHICH PRISON THESE TO BE CLOSE

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:28.991
IN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. OF

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.392
SURELY NOT THE WARDENS TO TELL

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:31.660
US BUT SURELY THEY EXPECT THE

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:32.661
GENERAL IF THEY'RE IN AND OUT

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.129
OF OUR PRISONS. LOOKING AT THE

01:10:34.196 --> 01:10:35.331
FACILITIES LOOKING AT THE

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.032
MAINTENANCE OF THINGS AND ALSO

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:38.167
HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING. OF

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:39.635
WHAT IS THERE. SO I FIND IT

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:42.037
VERY WELLPERSONALLY- DIFFICULT

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:44.940
FOR ME TO. CUT OF THE INSPECTOR

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.008
GENERAL F. WE SPEND SO MUCH

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.876
TIME TRYING TO REALIZE TO ONCE

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:49.345
AGAIN TO RESTORE THEM TO THE

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.213
POSITION OF. OVERSIGHT

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.348
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE HAD SO

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:53.582
MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT WITHIN

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:54.650
OUR PRISONS THAT HAVE COME

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:55.751
FORWARD IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUALS

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.519
EITHER BEING TREATED. THOSE

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.922
KINDS OF THINGS WE CUT OUT THIS

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:00.522
IS ALSO CUTTING OUT THE

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:03.092
CAMERAS- IN THE PRISONS THAT TO

01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:04.193
GIVE US SOME OVERSIGHT SOME

01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:06.028
EYES AND EARS AND THERE THAT.

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:07.830
THAT SO IT SEEMS THAT THE-

01:11:07.896 --> 01:11:09.598
VALUES THAT WE HAVE A SOMETIME

01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:10.799
KNOW THAT MAYBE YOU CAN TELL US

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.534

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:15.004
OUT THE WINDOW AND WE'RE BACK

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:15.571
TO SQUARE ONE WHERE YOU WERE

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:17.773
BEFORE. WANT TO KNOW WHY DJJ.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.575
ASI SAID WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:20.676
COLLISION AND EVERYONE HEARS

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:22.578
AGREE THAT THAT. CLOSURE IS A

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:24.580
GOOD IDEA WHICH WE DID LAST

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:26.649
YEAR EXTENSIVELY IN HEARINGS.

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:28.784
WE HEARD FROM HOPE LOTS OF

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:31.553
COMMUNITY PEOPLE- TRY TO FORM

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:36.058
SOME KIND OF STRIP. BASIN TO DO

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:41.130
THAT. AND ACT SCREWED YEAH THE

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:45.034
PROJECT. BUT WITH. PROPOSED FOR

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.201
COMMUNITY PEOPLE SO AS I

01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:47.936
MEMBERS OF ARE SORRY IS REALLY

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:48.837
THE PROCESS YOU KNOW WHAT IS A

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:50.472
PROCEDURE THAT'S GOING TO BE IN

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:51.940
ENGAGE THEM TO ENSURE THAT

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:53.642
THERE IS A SAFE AND REASONABLE

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:55.711
TRANSITION OF FOR THE FOLKS IN

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:57.413
THE JJ SO I THINK THOSE THOSE

01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:58.580
BECOME EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.816
WE TALK ABOUT. THE KINDS OF

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:01.917
GENERAL CUTS OF THE KIND OF

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.719
CUTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE THAT

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:06.221
IS THE YEAR- I'VE BEEN ASKED

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:07.790
CLEARLY BY MY COLLEAGUES AS TO

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:10.292
WHY IT ALL OF THE OTHER AREAS

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:12.461
AND MAYBE YOU CAN ALSO ANSWER

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:13.328
THAT UNFORTUNATELY THE CDC IS

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:16.198
NOT HERE TO TELL ME WHAT CCC

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.200
OURS BUT IT IS THE SAME AS IT

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:19.334
WAS LAST. OF WITH THIS SHIFTING

01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:21.537
AND- ELSE'S EXPERIENCE. MAJOR

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:24.139
CUTS AND WE SEE THAT THE- CDC

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:26.141
ARE HAS HAD PROBABLY ZERO CUTS.%

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:27.342
A WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BACK OF

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:30.145
PAGE. ONE WELL WE STARTED THE

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:31.280
AMOUNT OF THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:33.549
CHANGE. IS REALLY NEGLIGIBLE.

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:34.883
IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY WERE

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:37.286
SUPPOSED TO HAVE. IN JANUARY

01:12:37.352 --> 01:12:39.354
AND WHAT THEY HAVE NOW- STILL

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:41.356
THIRTEEN POINT SOME ODD BILLION

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:43.092
DOLLARS GOING INTO CDC ARE. A

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:45.427
WOULD SHIFT OUT AND IN TERMS OF

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:46.695
THINGS THAT WE VALUE. AND YEAH

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.564
WE GET UP IN THE SAME SPOT IN

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:49.164
TERMS OF MONEY. NO THAT OUR

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:51.433
SCHOOL PEOPLE ASKING WHY IS IT

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.868
THIS THE ONLY ENTITY. AND HAS

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:56.538
NOT EXPERIENCE ANY MADE CUTS

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:57.706
THAT ARE THERE. BLACK BUT YOU

01:12:57.773 --> 01:12:59.108

01:12:59.174 --> 01:13:00.042
RAISING A THINK THAT ARE. WE TO

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:01.510
RAISE AS WE DECIDE WHAT WE'RE

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:04.747
GOING TO. AGREE TO AND WHAT

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:05.748
WE'RE NOT GOING TO AGREE TO.

01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:07.249

A NUMBER OF THINGS ARE HOUSING

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.085

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:47.516
WE COULD RESTORE SOME OF THESE

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:49.318
FUNDING LEVELS BUT AS I

01:14:49.384 --> 01:14:51.019
MENTIONED THESE ARE SUBJECT TO

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:53.288
REFINEMENT AND ALL THE CAPULETS

01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:55.023
AROUND THE ACTUAL FEDERAL FUNDS

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.592
AND HOW MUCH CONTENT. TO THEIR

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:57.559
NUMBER TRIGGERS THROUGHOUT NOT

01:14:57.626 --> 01:14:58.460
ONLY IN OUR BUDGET BUT

01:14:58.527 --> 01:14:59.862
THROUGHOUT THE OTHER BUT JUST

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:00.796
SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY ALL

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:02.231
GET IN LINE. AND THEN WHO

01:15:02.297 --> 01:15:05.167
DETERMINES WHO'S AT THE FRONT

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:05.767
OF THE LINE AT THE BACK OF THE

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:07.169
LINE. I'M I THINK THERE'S STILL

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:08.537
SOME UNCERTAINTY AROUND THAT

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:11.540
PROCESS- AND AGAIN THESE LIST

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:13.542
AREN'T. A FINAL AT THIS POINT

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:15.043
THEY'RE SUBJECT TO REFINEMENT

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.579
AND- AND CERTAINLY TO-

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:19.815
ENGAGEMENT- WITH THE UP WITH

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:20.816
THE APPROPRIATE THAT

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:21.850
STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:24.019
LEGISLATURE SO. I'M YOU KNOW IN

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:25.020
TERMS OF THE THAT THE PROCESS

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:27.222
FOR. FOR WHO DETERMINES THAT I

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:29.458
THINK. I'M AGAIN. AND IT'LL BE

01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:31.193
ANOTHER CONVERSATION I BASED ON

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.895
THE ON THE PRIORITIES AND

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:34.363
ULTIMATELY WHAT. I'M ACTIONS

01:15:34.429 --> 01:15:37.132
ARE TAKEN. I'M IN THE IN THE

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.534
COMMITTEES. SO I ASSUME THAT I

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:40.669
WOULD HOPE THAT IT WOULD HAVE

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:42.204
AT LEAST A LIST OF PRIORITIES

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:44.673
ARE. SOME IDEA OF WHERE FOLKS

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.408
ARE IN THE IN THE LINE FOR CUTS

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:48.377
SO THEY'VE RESOURCES COME AND

01:15:48.443 --> 01:15:50.279
IF THEY DON'T ALL COME INTO- AS

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:51.713
ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WOULD BE

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.248
SOME. DISCUSSION WITH THE

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:54.283
LEGISLATURE CONCERNING HOW

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:55.550
THOSE CUTS HAVE THOSE TRIGGERS

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:58.053
WHAT WHAT IS TRIGGERED AND WHAT

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:58.987
SHOULD BE FUNDED AS A RESULT O

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:00.989
THE TRIGGER. A BASED ON OUR

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:01.924
PRIORITIES THAT WOULD BE

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:03.058
HELPFUL RATHER THAN JUST

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.427
DISCOVERING THAT THE TRIGGER

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:07.763
HAS STRINGS OF HAPPEN AND ALL

01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:09.865

FACILITIES WERE TALKING ABOUT.

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:56.131
I REMEMBER BUILDING NEW POLICE

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:59.134
BASILIDES WITH HOLDING CELLS.

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:01.436
AND THEN WE MOVE STAFF AND WAS

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.138
A BIG ENOUGH BECAUSE IT TOOK

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:04.706
FIVE YEARS SOMETIMES TEN YEARS

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:06.608
TO BUILD IT. BUILDING COSTS

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:08.210
WENT UP AND IN THE SPIRIT WE

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:10.011
HAD FIVE YEARS AGO WE'RE

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:12.180
TOTALLY IRRELEVANT. ON FIVE

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:15.050
YEARS LATER AND- IT WAS A BIG

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:16.818
ENOUGH AND SO YOU REALLY DO

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:18.920

WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO MOVE TO

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:21.456
PERSONNEL. I THINK EVEN BEFORE

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:23.959
YOU COME UP WITH A NUMBER SO

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:25.260
WILL BE REALLY HELPFUL. ON HOW

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:28.830
YOU. KIND OF FIGURED EVEN TO

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:30.632
SIX POINT FOUR IN SAVINGS WHAT

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:32.767
IS THAT BASED ON. AND A MOVING

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:34.402
FORWARD I WOULD EVEN LOVE TO

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:36.271
HELP YOU WITH. HOW TO FIGURE

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:38.940

CLOSE FACILITY TO WE'RE GOING

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:42.677
TO BE STAFFING NEXT. IN

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:46.982
ADDITION. ON THE- ELIMINATING

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:51.686
DJJ AND. AND SOME OTHER THINGS

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:53.622
THAT WERE WE'RE DOING OUR

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:55.624
MOVING THINGS DOWN TO THE

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:58.326
COUNTY WE DID THAT BEFORE IT

01:19:58.393 --> 01:20:00.295
WAS CALLED AB ONE OWN NINE WELL

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:02.764
WE JUST JUMPED EVERYONE BECAUSE

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:03.965
OF A FISCAL PROBLEM AND MORE

01:20:04.032 --> 01:20:06.535
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WERE UNDER

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:08.436
A FEDERAL MANDATE. WE JUST DID

01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:10.972
IT WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY WITH

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:13.375
NO PROCEDURES ON HOW THESE

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:13.975
INDIVIDUALS WHAT THEY GOT TO

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:15.877
THE COUNTY LEVEL. HOW THEY

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.379
WOULD NOT RECIDIVIST HOW WE NOT

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:19.748
BECOME A OUR FARM A DETRIMENT

01:20:19.814 --> 01:20:21.416
BUT MOST IMPORTANT HOW THE

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:23.818
JAILS WOULD BE IMPACTED AND DO

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:25.720
WE GIVE THEM ENOUGH RESOURCES

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:27.422
FUNDING. SO THEY BECOME COULD

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:29.391
SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY GOT THERE

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:31.326
AND SO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE TURN

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.762
ABOUT DJJ. AND SEEM TO THE

01:20:33.828 --> 01:20:36.198
COUNTIES OF DO WE HAVE A FULL

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:38.667
PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:39.100
THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:42.504
SUCCESSFUL. BUT AND THEN ON THE

WITHIN PRISONS THAT ARE THAT

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:56.952
NOTE THOSE NUMBERS ARE

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:59.521
INCREASING I THINK WE NEED TO

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:02.123
FULLY FUND AN OFFICE OF

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.992

WHAT'S GOING ON BUT HOW WE CAN

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:21.409
MOVE FORWARD SO THAT WE DON'T.

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:23.011
SEND OUT THOUSANDS OF

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:24.713

INFECT PEOPLE THAT ARE WITHIN

THINGS THERE TO MAKE THAT THAT.

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:54.843
THAT INFECTION DOESN'T IMPACT

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:55.343
THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:57.579

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:17.946

FOR ABOUT. THIS IS CRYSTAL SURE

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.407
THAT WOULD DEPARTMENT OF

01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:48.576
FINANCE AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT

01:25:48.643 --> 01:25:50.845
AN EXPERT BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:52.680
THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:55.283
CORRECTIONS I DOES CURRENTLY

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:57.585

01:25:57.652 --> 01:25:58.920
I'M IN THAT WOULD CONTINUE FOR

THESE YOUTH- THAT WOULD BE AND

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:03.858
I CAN I FACILITIES. HAVING

MISSED STONE ALSO RAISE THAT

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:07.228
ISSUE EARLIER. THAT WHICH WE

01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:08.763
CANNOT GIVE UP OUR OVERSIGHT SO

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:09.864
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:11.599
THAT'S SOME KIND OF REFLECTED

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:12.800
IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OR

01:26:12.867 --> 01:26:15.036
SOMETHING SO THAT. THE KIND OF

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:16.671
SERVICES OUR STUDENTS GET OUR

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:18.106
CARE KIDS GET IT NOT DEPENDENT

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:20.241
UPON WHAT COUNTY THEY LIVE IN.

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:21.976
YOU KNOW. GOOD TO HAVE SOME

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:23.278
HORRIBLE SITUATIONS IT'S A

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:24.846
WONDERFUL SITUATION SO WE HAVE

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:26.281
TO HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY. OF

01:26:26.347 --> 01:26:27.916
THE RESOURCES IN THE SUPPORT IN

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:29.284
THE OUTCOMES THAT WE LIKE TO

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:30.885
SEE. YOUNG PEOPLE AS A RESULT

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:32.787
OF THAT ENGAGEMENT. SO I THINK

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:34.489
THE ISSUE OF US GIVING UP. OUR

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:35.957
OVERSIGHT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.492
RAISED AND I THINK WE SHOULD

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:38.293
MAKE SURE THAT THAT. DOES NOT

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:40.929
HAPPEN. OKAY BUT ISSUE. ANY

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:42.063

BABY DO DO YOU DO. BRING IT

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:53.374
OPPORTUNITY BRING IN REVENUE.

01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:55.877
THIS IS SO TO ASK IN TWENTY

01:26:55.944 --> 01:26:57.111
TWELVE EDIT I DON'T KNOW WHERE

01:26:57.178 --> 01:27:01.616
WE ARE NOW. S. R. THIS IS I'M A

01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:02.684
GENEROUS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:04.719
FINANCE I THINK- YOU KNOW I CAN

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:06.321
HAVE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SEND

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:08.156
YOU THE MOST RECENT COLLECTIONS

01:27:08.222 --> 01:27:09.657
REPORT- IF THAT WOULD BE

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:11.459
HELPFUL BUT- I THINK A LOT OF

01:27:11.526 --> 01:27:13.294
THE UNCOLLECTED FINES AND FEES

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:15.597
ARE. ARE REALLY FROM YOU KNOW

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:16.397
PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY CAN'T

01:27:16.464 --> 01:27:19.067
AFFORD TO PAY ANYWAYS- AND SO

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:20.368
THAT'S WHY THERE IS QUITE A

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:21.636
LARGE- I'M COLLECTED THAT

01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:23.171
BALANCE BUT I THINK THAT'S- A

01:27:23.237 --> 01:27:24.505
KIND OF SENSE OF THE IMPORTANCE

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:26.407
OF OUR ABILITY TO PAY PROPOSAL

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:27.175
THAT WE'VE INCLUDED IN THE

01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:28.676
BUDGET- BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

FEES FOR INDIVIDUALS BY AT

01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:34.282
LEAST 50% IF NOT. I'M MORE OF A

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:36.017
BASED ON JUDICIAL DISCRETION I

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:37.619
THINK. YOU KNOW THE

01:27:37.685 --> 01:27:39.487
ADMINISTRATION AND THE UNIT AND

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:40.455
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ARE

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:41.923
WORKING T TRYING TO HELP

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:43.458
PEOPLE SO THAT WAY WE CAN BE

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:47.829
ABLE TO COLLECT REVENUES- FROM

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:49.931
FINES AND FEES. I'VE BEEN I.

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:51.232
WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY PLAN IS

01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:54.636
BECAUSE- IF YOUR PLAN IS TO

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:56.704
KEEP. IF YOU HAVE NO PLANS. BUT

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:58.306
I'VE EVEN HEARD FIFTY CENTS ON

01:27:58.373 --> 01:28:00.008
THE DOLLAR I HAVEN'T HEARD AN

ANYTHING. FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL

01:28:03.811 --> 01:28:05.146
ABOUT HOW TO COLLECT IT OTHER

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:07.348
THAN THIS. THE SAME WOULD HAVE

01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:08.416
BEEN DOING IT FOR THE LAST

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:10.351
SEVEN YEARS. AND WHAT MY POINT

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:12.086
IS. YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THE

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:14.288
SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN

01:28:14.355 --> 01:28:16.524
EXPECT A DIFFERENT RESULT. WE

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:17.592

TWENTY. EVER NEEDED IN TWENTY

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.669
TWENTY ONE SO WHAT ARE WE DOING

01:28:27.735 --> 01:28:29.537
ONE WEEK TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:32.073
THAT AND MORE IMPORTANT IS

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:32.607
PROBABLY AN ADMINISTRATIVE

01:28:32.674 --> 01:28:34.976
COSTS JUST TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:37.011
THAT. THAT COULD BE ANOTHER

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:38.780
STATE STATE WE COULD GET OFF

01:28:38.846 --> 01:28:42.116
THE BOOKS SO I DON'T. I DON'T

01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:43.418
UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS A KIND

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:45.186
OF A PRIORITY ESPECIALLY SINCE

01:28:45.253 --> 01:28:47.889
IT WILL HELP. WITH ANY BUDGET

01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:51.626

PUT OUT- SERIES OF REPORTS ON

01:29:02.403 --> 01:29:04.272
STEPS THE STATE COULD TAKE TO
