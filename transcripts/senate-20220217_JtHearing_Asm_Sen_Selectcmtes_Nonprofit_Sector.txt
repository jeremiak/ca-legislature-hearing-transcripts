AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE NONPROFIT SECTOR I AM PLEASED TO WELCOME YOU TO OUR FIRST INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THIS SESSION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US I BECAME CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. THE NONPROFIT SECTOR IS ONE THAT I'M INTIMATELY AWARE OF HAVING FOUNDED A NONPROFIT MYSELF. IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I NOW HAVE THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A BACKGROUND IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR I KNOW JUST HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO OPERATE A NONPROFIT LET ALONE OPERATING ONE DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS BEEN CHALLENGING FOR ALL. WE HAVE HEARD STORIES OF HOW THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND FOR THE MOST PART HOW THE SECTORS HAVE NAVIGATED CHALLENGES. ONE STORY THAT IS NOT HEARD AS OFTEN BUT ONE THAT WE NEED TO ELEVATE AND UNDERSTAND IS THAT OF NON PROFITS NONPROFITS ARE AT THE CENTER OF OUR COMMUNITIES THEY WORK AROUND THE CLOCK TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITY. AND PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES THEY HELP HUNGRY FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO PURCHASE FOOD ASSIST THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT OUR OWN HOUSE RESIDENTS. AND SO MUCH MORE OUR NEEDS WOULD GO ONE MET IF IT WEREN'T FOR NONPROFITS WHO CONTINUOUSLY STEP UP. NONPROFITS OFTEN OPERATE BEHIND THE SCENES BUT I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH WE WOULD NOT BE WHERE WE ARE NOW WITHOUT THEM. AS THEIR WORK CONTINUED ON THE FRONT LINES THEY WERE CONTINUOUSLY LEFT BEHIND THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. I ALONG WITH TWENTY NINE OTHER MEMBERS WROTE A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR TO ENSURE THAT FUNDING TO NONPROFITS WERE PROVIDED IN THEIR TIME OF NEED. SINCE NONPROFITS ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE PROVIDE THEM WITH THE FUNDS AND SUPPORT. THEIR NEEDS SO THEY CAN WEATHER ANY FUTURE STORMS. THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM NONPROFIT LEADERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE HOPE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED THEIR OPERATIONS AND HOW THEY HAVE NAVIGATED CHALLENGES. WHILE THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN CHALLENGING IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT AND BETTER PREPARE OUR NON PROFITS FOR FUTURE EMERGENCIES. I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR LEE MON. OF THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE NONPROFIT SECTOR TO SHARE A FEW OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT CHAIR RIVAS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP- AND THANK YOU TO BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE FOR THIS JOINT HEARING I KNOW THAT WHEN OUR NONPROFIT SELECT COMMITTEE STARTED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

IF IT IN IN THE COMMUNITY SAID I'VE REPRESENTED IN SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA COUNTY. CONSISTENTLY IF I'M LOOKING FOR THE BEST MOST LIKE MINDED PEOPLE ON THE CONTRARY THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY CARE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY. I TURN TO THE NONPROFIT SECTOR THAT'S WHERE YOU FIND THOSE PEOPLE THEY GENUINELY THINK ABOUT COMMUNITY. NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUAL AND WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY IN AMERICA TODAY- WE'VE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE OF LOS THAT IMPORTANT SENSE OF LOOKING OUT FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY AND INSTEAD. TOO MUCH LOOKING OUT SPECIFICALLY FOR THEMSELVES AND SO TO EVERYBODY IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD- I WANT TO TAKE MY HAT OFF AND SAY THANK YOU FOR SORT OF REPRESENTING. THAT VERY IMPORTANT- ELEMENTARY AND HOLDING OUR COMMUNITIES TOGETHER- AND THE SECOND THING IS THAT I WAS JUST ON THE PHONE WITH A- LINDA BROWN TREASURE FROM THE- RUST FUND OF THE HOUSING TRUST FUNDED.

OF I WANT TO SHARE IN TERMS OF BEING AN IMPORTANT KEY EMPLOYER THE NONPROFIT SECTOR IS THE FOURTH LARGEST EMPLOYER IN CALIFORNIA AND IS A LEADER IS LEADING THE WAY IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION ON ITS STAFF 63% OF THE WORKFORCE OF NONPROFITS IS OUR WOMEN ARE 29% OF NONPROFIT LEADERSHIP ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR COMPARED 212% IN THE GENERAL WORKFORCE.

AND A KEY EMPLOYER IN THE STATE. WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY SO NONPROFIT TO BRING IN AS AN EXAMPLE ONE EXAMPLE MORE THAN FORTY BILLION INTO CALIFORNIA FROM OUT OF STATE. AND WE GENERATE 15% OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PROJECT. I WANT TO MOVE CLOSER TO HOME IN TERMS OF SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW NONPROFIT THAT STEPPED UP DURING THE PANDEMIC TRYING FROM OUR OUR PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE THAT- AS NONPROFIT BECAUSE IN THE VENTURA SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AREA- FIRST IN TERMS OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY ON THE ON THE MARGINS AND UNDERSERVED OF COURSE INCREASED DEMAND. TWO EXAMPLES YOU. KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS HOW MENTAL HEALTH IS A TOP PRIORITY DURING THE PANDEMIC WE CONTINUE TO ORGANIZE YOUTH- FOR A COLLECTIVE VOICE HELLO BUT YOU WERE ABLE TO WIN- INCREASED- COUNSELORS SO IMPORTANT TO THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS COVE IT BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT THAT THEY ARE BARRED. THEY ARE LOCKED OUT OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND DURING OF THE PANDEMIC. UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WERE THE HARDEST HIT BY JOB LOSS IMMIGRANT WOMEN IN PARTICULAR WERE THE HARDEST HIT. AND WORKING WITH OTHER NONPROFITS WE LAUNCHED- OFFICIALLY AS A NONPROFIT ITSELF THE EIGHT OH FIVE IN DOCUSIGN WHICH DISTRIBUTED OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT RELIEF FINANCIAL RELIEF. TO UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO LOST THEIR JOB AND WORK IN ELIGIBLE TO CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH OTHER A NONPROFIT STATEWIDE TO FIX THAT IN JUSTICE AND. LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SUPPORT IN THAT. ARE KEEPING THEM. A LOT AND HOW STEP UP SO ADDS IN ORDER. AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. WE HELP TO KEEP DEMOCRACY ALIVE DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN EVERYTHING WAS SHUT DOWN INCLUDING PUBLIC MEETINGS PHYSICALLY. WE TAUGHT YOUTH YOUNG ADULTS AND AN ADULT HOW DO YOU USE THEM HOW TO OF WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT THE CITY COUNCIL THE COUNTY SUPERVISOR AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE. TO SPEAK UP EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC AND PARTICIPATE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. OF NONPROFITS CONTINUING TO STEP BEYOND THEIR MISSION. IN OUR CASE WE ARE IN ORGANIZING AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND YET WE STEPPED UP TO DO DIRECT SERVICE. TO HELP PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR THE VACCINE. AND YOU KNOW GET TO- THE NECESSARY. RESOURCES THEY NEED DURING THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADI SALA I'M NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CARMEN IDEA REPRESENTING AND CONCEAL OF STOCKTON. AFTERNOON MY NAME IS GOVERNMENT BY THE END OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF AT CONSIGLIO CALIFORNIA ECHO STUDIOS AND NONPROFIT MULTI SERVICE AGENCY CURRENTLY SERVING SAN JOAQUIN STANISLAUS AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES. WITH A MISSION TO UP LIFT AND ADVOCATE FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BY PROVIDING CRITICAL SERVICES AND RESOURCES WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCE DURING THIS PANDEMIC ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN SERVING OUR COMMUNITY FOR OVER FIFTY FOUR YEARS AND THE PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED. THAT WE ARE A TRUSTED RESOURCE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND A MESSENGER AND WE ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL FIRST RESPONDERS TO OUR COMMUNITY. OUR ORGANIZATION HAD TO ACT QUICKLY AND DEVISING STRATEGIZE AND CREATE A PLAN OF ACTION ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO. OUR CLIENTS. AND OUR COMMUNITY. WE REALIZE QUICKLY THAT WE HAD TO TAKE THE RESOURCES OUT INTO OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT WE COULDN'T WAIT FOR OUR MEMBERS TO COME TO US THE FIRST THING WE HAD TO DO WAS TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WE HAVE MOVE SOME OF OUR SERVICES- FOR TO DIGITAL. AND SO WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE WERE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT'S WHAT WE HAD TO DO WAS WE HAD TO HELP CREATE EMAIL ADDRESSES HOW TO PROVIDE EDUCATION ON HOW TO ACCESS GOOGLE MEETS AND ZUNE MEETINGS- TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITY WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE TO ACCESS THESE CRITICAL SERVICES THAT THEY NEED IT WE ALSO DISTRIBUTED LAPTOPS AND ALSO SENT OUT MOBILE HOT SPOTS. TO AREAS THAT WERE NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITY WE ALSO LED TO VARIOUS GRASSROOTS EFFORTS IN OUR COMMUNITY- BY PROVIDING INFORMATION. ON COULD NINETEEN AND RESOURCES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MANY LOCAL NONPROFITS. THE FIRST THING THAT WE DID WE ORGANIZED MANY POP UP. VACCINE AND TESTING CLINICS- AT IT AT OUR OFFICES AT LOCAL GROCERY STORES AT PLACES OF WORK. OUT LOCAL RANCHES- OUTSIDE OF SCHOOLS WE ACTUALLY TOOK THE RESOURCES TO THE PEOPLE- AND MAKE THEM MORE THEY NEEDED AND- ALSO AT THE TIME THAT THEY NEEDED WE ENSURED THAT THESE CLINICS WERE PROVIDED. OUTSIDE OF WORK HOURS AND ON THE WEEKENDS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAD ACCESS AS NOT EVERYONE HAS THE LUXURY. OF TAKING TIME OFF DURING THE NORMAL WORKING DAY- WE ALSO. WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE TRANSLATION SERVICES- AND WERE ABLE TO HELP. ARM CLIENTS FILL OUT FORMS AND ANSWER QUESTIONS IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE- AND WE ALSO HELP EASE THEIR HESITANCY- FOR UNDOCUMENTED. AND ARE UNINSURED COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO CREATED AN ACT TASK FORCE- WERE WE MET WEEKLY- WITH OTHER NONPROFITS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHAT THE FOCUS ON REACHING OUR FARMWORKERS COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE ACESS TO VACCINES. AND TESTING AS WELL AS EDUCATION FOR THIS COMMUNITY. OUR FIRST EVER A TESTING SITE WE HAD AN OVERWHELMING DEMAND OR WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE SHOW UP SO GROCERY A PARKING LOT. AND SO WE CAN REALIZE THAT THE NEED WAS CRITICAL AND SO- WE HAVE VACCINATED OVER SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE AND PROVIDED TESTING FOR OVER FOUR THOUSAND. WE ALSO NOTICED THAT THERE WAS- STARTED TO BE A CRITICAL NEED AND FOOD INSECURITY SO WE ESTABLISHED A FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM WHERE WE SET UP AWEEKLY FOOD DRIVE. AND WE WERE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE OVER EIGHT THOUSAND FOOD BOXES. WE ALSO ESTABLISHED A COVERT OUTREACH TEAM- THAT PROVIDED OVER OUTREACH EDUCATION. AND WE HAVE OUR UCLA GETUP THE VACCINE TEAM THAT HAS CANVASSED OVER TWO THOUSAND HOURS KNOCKING ON DOORS IN OUR COMMUNITIES OR ARE MOST IMPACTED ZIP CODES AS WELL AS OUR SAVIOR HEALTH GET OUT THE VACCINE. FIFTY EIGHT THAT HAS CALLED OVER NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE I'M TRYING TO- ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO A VACCINE SAFETY- OR ALSO INFORMING THEM OF OUR NEXT TEXTING CLINIC LOCATIONS. WE ALSO A MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT THAT WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION ACCESS- TO THOSE THAT DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ATTEND A MEDICAL APPOINTMENT OR ATTEND A VACCINE CLINIC. IN CONJUNCTION THE CITY OF STOCKTON WE ALSO OPERATED EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO HELP- RENTERS WITH- UTILITY AND RENT ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS PROVIDED OBJECTION PREVENTION EDUCATION. WE WERE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO OVER FIVE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS- IN ADDITION TO THAT WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSISTANCE. TO ARE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY WHO WAS LEFT OUT OF OUR FIRST- STIMULUS PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO HELP THEM AND PROVIDE SOME RELIEF. I'M ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE FACED- AND THAT WE'VE ENCOUNTERED IS THE LACK OF FLEXIBILITY ON SOME OF OUR STATE CONTRACTS. FOR EXAMPLE- WHAT THE COVERT SHUTDOWN OCCURRED IN MARCH WE SUBMITTED SOME ODD BUDGET MODIFICATIONS AND BUDGET QUESTIONS- TO THE STATE REGARDING OUR PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. WE DIDN'T RECEIVE AN ANSWER TO THOSE- AND TELL OCTOBER WHICH KIND OF CREATED SOME UNCERTAINTY- MENTAL ALLOWED US TO HAVE TO COVER SOME UP FRONT COSTS AS WE DECIDED TO KEEP OUR PRESCHOOL DOORS OPEN. TO PROVIDE- DAY CARE SERVICES TO OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITY- WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH THAT OUR OPERATING BUDGET- ALLOWED US TO HAVE A RAINY DAY FUND THAT WE DECIDED THAT THE PANDEMIC- CALLED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE THOSE FUNDS- INTEL WE RECEIVED THE QUESTIONS TO OUR BUDGET- CONCERNS. REGARDING REIMBURSEMENTS- RATES THE WORK THAT WE GET TO DO EVERY DAY IN OUR COMMUNITY- AND ALSO ALL THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR LOCAL NONPROFITS- THE PANDEMIC HAS EXEMPLIFIED THAT WE ARE TRUSTED MESSENGERS. AND THAT- WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE THE LEAD ON CRESTWOOD EFFORTS AND ACTUALLY HELP THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO AS WE GO BACK TO. NORMAL WHATEVER THAT CASE MAY BE WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR NON PROFITS AS WE HAVE SHOWN THE ABILITY TO REACH. OUR COMMUNITIES AND HELP THOSE MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I'M NEXT WE'LL HEAR. NEWS VOLUNTEER CENTER. CHAIRWOMAN RIVAS CHAIRWOMAN LIMÃ“N COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TO SHARE SOME OF THE LESSONS WE LEARNED FROM OUR RESPONSES TO THE PANDEMIC AND THE CZ U. FIRES WHICH HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME OUR CENTER IS THE HOME TO ABOUT A DOZEN IMPACT PROGRAMS SO WE DO DIRECT SERVICES AND WE ALSO WORK TO CONNECT THREE HUNDRED LOCAL NONPROFIT PARTNERS TO VOLUNTEERS pTHESE OTHER SMALL GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR COMMUNITY SO I'D LIKE TO. TALK WITH BOTH HATS ON- YOU KNOW NOTHING SYMBOLIZES HOW GREAT WE ARE AT- MOVING QUICKLY TO OVERCOME BARRIERS TO SERVICE AS THESE MASKS- EARLY SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES AND LACK OF PPE- BECAUSE WE OFTEN ARE UNDER RESOURCE WE DO WE CROWDSOURCE THIS WE DELIVERED OUR FIRST THOUSAND MASS TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND NEW SHELTER PARTNERS WITHIN A WEEK WE STOPPED COUNTING AT TWENTY THOUSAND I THINK- YOU KNOW WE TRANSITION OUR COUNSELING SO CENTERS TO TELEHEALTH. ARE NEED PROGRAMS WHERE PEOPLE CAME TO US IN IN A MEAL TO DRIVE THROUGH MEETING ARE TRANSUNION TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS TO FOOD DELIVERY PROGRAMS AS YOU'RE HEARING A LOT THIS OUT ADAPTABILITY TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO US IT'S A CORE COMPETENCY OF THE NONPROFIT SECTOR AND I REALLY THINK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR STEPPING IN AND HELPING WITH THIS ISSUE ABOUT GETTING SOME FLEXIBILITY IN CONTRACTING IT IS REALLY CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. NOW IT'S OUR PEOPLE WHO DELIVER THESE RESULTS AT A TIME WHEN WE WERE REINVENTING EVERYTHING ABOUT OURSELVES TO MEET CRITICAL NEEDS WE ALSO WERE LAYING OFF 5% OF OUR STAFF WE ENACTED A ONE YEAR WAGE FREEZE AND OUR STAFF ON TOP OF THAT TOOK AN ADDITIONAL 10% FOR LOW TO SAVE. THE JOBS OF THREE MORE CO WORKERS. WITHOUT SUSTAINED INVESTMENT IN THE TO PAY FOR WAY FAR. WORKERS BY FUNDERS AT EVERY NO WAY WE CAN THRIVE AND BE READY TO RESPOND. DURING THE NEXT DISASTER THAT WE ALL THAT WAS COMING. I DO NOT KNOW A SINGLE SMALL AND MIDSIZE NONPROFIT IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY ARE ON THE CENTRAL COAST THAT IS NOT STRUGGLING LIKE WE ARE TO FILL THE VACANCIES AND PAY A FAIR WAGE IN THESE HGH COST COUNTIES. LOCAL NONPROFITS AS I AGREE AS THE VOTE MANY OF SAID HOW DEEP COMMUNITY ROOTS AND WE'RE TRUSTED PEOPLE- PARTICULAR BY FOLKS WHO ARE HIGHER RISK FOR HARD TO REACH IN DISASTER. ACCESS TO THESE DEEP ROOT NETWORKS ARE WIN WIN FOR OUR STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS. AS WELL AS FOR OUR FOLKS AND ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS WE HAD A PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES- WHEN CODE HIT. IN THE TWO WEEKS CALIFORNIA WAS CLOSING DOWN WE WERE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO OUR- COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS SO THAT WHEN SCHOOLS CLOSED IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR TWO LARGEST- SPANISH SPEAKING SCHOOL DISTRICTS UP POP WROTE. AND LIVE VOTE. WHEN EVERY PARENT WHO IS SPANISH SPEAKING SHOWED UP TO GET THEIR POCKETS AND TECHNOLOGY THEY WERE ALSO MET WITH SOMEONE TO BE GIVEN. COVERED GUIDES IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH KEEP YOUR FAMILYBECAUSE OF ITS STATE WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE PROVIDER SO IS EVERYBODY WAS DELIVERING FOOD AND MEALS ON WHEELS IS TRUSTED PARTNERS. DELIVERED INFORMATION THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BROKER AND AS WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY THE SET UP MASS VACCINES SITES. WE SAW OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS- NOT ALMOST SIGNING PEOPLE UP BUT- OFFERING POP UPS. BRINGING PEOPLE TO THE WE HAD A QUICK LISTED IF THEY WERE AT. EXTRA SHOTS AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WOULD COLOR NONPROFITS AND THEY WOULD BRING. BRING FOLKS- MOST SMALL NONPROFITS WOULD LOVE TO DO MORE OF THIS AND THEY WOULD BE A POWERFUL FORCE FOR EQUITY. BUT EVEN WHEN THEIR STATE FUNDING AVAILABLE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPITAL ON HAND. TO START OF THESE NEW SERVICES NOW WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A CREDIT LINE. BUT THIS YEAR THE FIRST TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MY NONPROFIT. REYES IS NOT GOING TO MY STAFF OR TO INCREASING OUR SERVICES IT'S GOING TO PAY DEBT ON MY CREDIT LINE WHILE WE WAIT FOR REIMBURSEMENT. ON STATE AND FEDERAL CONTRACTS AND THAT IS AN UNNECESSARY BUSINESS BARRIER TO EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HOPE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO REMEDY. NOW IN ADDITION TO THE STOP LABOR MARKET ISSUES NONPROFITS ARE FACING WITH MY VOLUNTEER CENTER HAD ON  WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE VOLUNTEER LABOR CHALLENGE. AS IN PERSON SERVICES A REOPENING MOST LOCAL NONPROFITS ARE FINDING THAT TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY PERCENT. OTHER VOLUNTEERS ARE NOT RETURNING AND THE LARGEST GROUP OF LOS VOLUNTEERS ARE IN OUR ELDERS. THE GREAT NEWS IS THAT THERE'S A HEIGHTENED INTEREST IN VOLUNTEERING. PARTICULARLY AMONG MILLENNIALS. BUT WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE CRISIS AND LOCAL NONPROFITS THEY LACKED THE TECHNOLOGY. THE TRAINING AND THE TOOLS TO ENGAGE THIS YOUNGER VOLUNTEER WORK FORCE WHO HAVE PRETTY HIGH EXPECTATIONS. IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO BE SOLVED BY A CALL TO SERVICE OR AN ONLINE STATEMENT REGISTRY BECAUSE THE POBLEM ISN'T THAT WE NEED MORE PEOPLE TO WANT TO VOLUNTEER. EVERY SMALL NONPROFIT WE WORK WITH IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW WITH STAFF VACANCIES. INCREASED DEMAND FOR SERVICE OLD COMPUTERS. STILL STAGNANT DONOR DATA DATABASES AN AGING TECHNOLOGY. SO THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO ON BOARD ANY QUICK PLEASE NAME VOLUNTEERS THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THEM. AND THESE REASONABLE AND MODEST INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS A NEW COMPUTER. AS A SIMPLE OUT THE COST TO BACKGROUND CHECK AND ENSURE VOLUNTEERS. BILL LOOK LIKE OVERHEAD IN BUDGETS AND SO THEY'RE DIFFICULT TO SELL TO THE DONOR AND PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY. BUT SMART. SMALL INVESTMENTS. TO THE SCRIPT. THROUGHOUT OUR VOLUNTEER NOT ALL OUR VOLUNTEER CONSUMING NONPROFIT NETWORK WOULD PAY HUGE DIVIDENDS INCREASE DONATIONS OF TIME TALENT AND FUNDING FOR FRONTLINE LOCAL WORKERS AND IMAGINE HOW MUCH MORE READY WE WOULD BE. TO MEET FUTURE CHALLENGES THAT ARE SURE TO COME BECAUSE THIS INTEREST IN THIS NEW INTEREST IN VOLUNTEERING IF WE DON'T CAPTURE THAT NOW. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET IT BACK A YEAR FROM NOW OR TWO YEARS FROM NOW WHEN THE NEXT DISASTER IS ALREADY HERE. SO I THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING OUR PERSPECTIVES I THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF VOLUNTEERS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE THE THRIVING SUSTAINABLE COMPLETED IS. THAT WE ALL DESERVE. THANK YOU KAREN- OUR FINAL SPEAKER ON THIS FIRST PANEL IS JANET MARY NOT SHOW UP CEO OF MEN SERVING THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. WELCOME JANET THANK YOU ASSEMBLY CHAIR RIVAS SENATE SHERRY REHMAN AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY I'M SO HONORED TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF LAND WHICH HAS SERVED THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS COVIDIEN ARE VALLEY HARD PARTICULARLY THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HOME TO PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE THE MOST EVEN WHEN THERE'S NOT A CRISIS LIKE COBIT THOSE RUN HOUSE OR LIVE FAR BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. AT ONE POINT DURING THE PEAK OF THE FIRST WAVE PROCLAIM AWARE MEANT IS LOCATED BECAME THE EPICENTER OF INFECTIONS IN LA COUNTY WITH THE HIGHEST CASE RIGHT PER HUNDRED THOUSAND MANY OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE WHILE THEY MAY BE SHELTERED WOULD MEET THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF HOMELESSNESS THAT IS THEY LIVE IN CONDITIONS UNFIT FOR HUMAN HABITATION THEY LIVE IN GARAGES LEAN TO'S CRAWL SPACES THERE DOUBLED AND TRIPLED UP. ON THE THEY DON'T GET COUNTED DURING THE HOMELESS COUNTS SO MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE THERE THE VALLEY DOESN'T HAVE A SKID ROW WE'RE SEEING MORE IN CABINETS. BUT POVERTY IS LARGELY HIDDEN. OUR NURSE. PROGRAMS WHICH INCLUDE A FOOD PANTRY AND FOOD BANKS I INCREASES IN DEMAND AS HIGH AS FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. COMPARED TO NON COATED YEARS. THE NEED REMAINS HIGH AS GROCERY PRICES SKYROCKET AND ANY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ECONOMY HAVE NOT TRICKLED DOWN TO THEM. MODOC SICKLY THIS CRISIS IS ALSO AFFORDED MANDING CREDIBLE OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY IN A MORE ROBUST WAY FOR EXAMPLE CARES ACT FUNDING WAS DEPLOYED TO ENHANCE OUR FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS AND PROVIDE ON THE GROUND INFORMATION AND RESOURCES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH BECAUSE IT'S PHYSICAL. AND MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS AND MORE DOLLARS CAME AFTER THAT FROM PRIVATE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL SOURCES. BECAUSE OF THE FLOOD OF MONEY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES LIKE L. A. COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE SUBCONTRACTED WITH INTERMEDIARIES TO DISTRIBUTE THE GRASS SOME HAD NEVER MANAGE PUBLIC FUNDS LEAVING THEM. WITH A BIG LEARNING CURVE AND A VERY SHORT WINDOW TO GET THE DOLLARS OUT AND AGENCIES LIKE OURS FOUND THEMSELVES ACCEPTING BONTA ON PUBLIC FUNDING FOR THE FIRST TIME SCRAMBLING TO SET UP. SYSTEMS TO MANAGE THE DOLLARS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. DESPITE THESE CAPACITY CHANGES BECAUSE OF THESE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS WE WERE ABLE TO EXPAND OUR REACH EMPLOY MORE PEOPLE SERVE EVEN MORE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND BREATHED A LITTLE EASIER. SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE SERVED OUR COMMUNITY THROUGH ONE POINT SIX MILLION SERVICE ENCOUNTERS WE'VE DISTRIBUTED OVER SIX MILLION POUNDS OF FOOD SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE EAT CATS AND THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH VACCINE PROVIDERS WE HAVE SO FAR THIS ELIMINATED OVER FORTY SIX HUNDRED DOSES. THROUGH THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION ENCOUNTERS WE PUT THE FOOD ON THE TABLE A FAMILIES MOST OF WHOM USED A FOOD PANTRY FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE GONE WITHOUT. SO WHAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT IS WONDERING WHAT'S NEXT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT'S ALL OVER OUR BOARD AND I REGULARLY TALK ABOUT THE IMPENDING FUNDING CLIFF HOW DO WE ENSURE THE SERVICES PEOPLE NEED TO RECOVER. ARE THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING GOES AWAY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S ANOTHER EMERGENCY A WILD FIRE AND EARTHQUAKE. HOW DO WE DEPLOY SERVICES IF OUR OWN FACILITY IS DAMAGED. AS A RESULT OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE CURRENT STRATEGIC PLAN IS GROUNDED IN BUILDING THE RESILIENCE OF OUR ORGANIZATION AND OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT WE ARE READY FOR THE NEXT CRISIS. IN ORDER TO DO THAT ON GOING INVESTMENTS IN THE SECTOR ARE REQUIRED. TO CONTINUE TO BUILD THE CAPACITY WE NEED TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL OF RESILIENCE. PEOPLE NEED ACCESS TO GOOD WELL PAYING JOBS INCLUDING OUR OWN STAFF IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP WITH THE INCREASING AND JUSTIFY DEMAND FOR HIGHER WAGES WHEN THE FUNDS AWARDED TO NONPROFITS. HAVE LARGELY REMAINED STAGNANT. I KNOW THE NEXT PANEL WILL TALK ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEXT EMERGENCY BUT I WANT TO URGE EVERYONE TO REMEMBER THAT COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES WE SERVE. STRUGGLE DAILY POVERTY IS AN EMERGENCY HOMELESSNESS IS AN EMERGENCY FOR THEM THE NEXT EMERGENCY IS TOMORROW AND THE NEXT ONE THE DAY AFTER THAT. LIFE IN POVERTY IS A SERIES OF MICRO TRAUMAS OF SHAME GUILT EMBARRASSMENT FEAR THAT ACCUMULATE KEEPING PEOPLE IN SURVIVAL MODE. WE CAN NO LONGER LONGER LOOKING HOMELESSNESS AS A MONOLITH THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SHELTERED BUT NOT HOUSED WHO MAY NEED NOTHING MORE THAN ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY IN A FAIR WAY TO MAKE THAT NEXT STEP WE MUST PREVENT. THOSE AT RISK FROM FALLING INTO DEEPER CRISIS AND THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY IN DEEP CRISIS NEED TO BE LIFTED OUT EVEN BEFORE THE NEXT EMERGENCY. THE EFFECTS OF THIS PANDEMIC WILL NOT END THE DAY THE CDC DECLARES IS NOW ENDEMIC THE ECONOMIC AND PERSONAL INJURIES WILL CARRY ON FOR SOMETIME TO COME. WE CAN'T FORGET THESE DAILY STRUGGLES AS WE BEGIN TO GO ABOUT OUR BUSINESS AS YOU USUAL AND WHICH- FORGET TO STRENGTHEN. THE SAFETY NET THAT IS THE NON PROFITS THAT ARE HERE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING MY AND MY COLLEAGUES REMARKS TODAY. THANK YOU JANET THANK YOU FOR REMINDING US THAT SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE IN ALREADY IN A STATE IN A IN A OF EMERGENCY AND HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE BECAUSE OF POVERTY. ARE AND SO THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU TO ALL THE PANELISTS- FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES AND YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS I WILL NOW OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS FROM THE- MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANTED TO THAT WAS A MIGHT DROP FROM JANET I THINK SHE HIT ALL THE POINTS- BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES WHAT KEEPS UP US UP AT NIGHT AND IF. YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM SLEEPING AT NIGHT THEN I THINK YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME REASSESSMENTS- IN YOUR IN YOUR OWN COMMUNITY BECAUSE I KNOW AND I HAVE HEARD WITH JANET SAID WILL KEEP HER UP AT NIGHT. THE SAME THING KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT I WOULD A CHILD DOESN'T COME HOME- WE'RE IN- YOU KNOW WE GET A CALL FROM JUSTICE FOR MURDERED CHILDREN OR PARENTS OF MURDERED CHILDREN IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION TO GO AND STAND WITH PARENTS. WHO HAVE LOST THEIR THEIR CHILDREN I'M TO GUN VIOLENCE- IN IN LOS ANGELES AND SO THOSE AND IT IS A JANET HOW ARE WILLING ARTICULATED THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT SHOULD KEEP US UP AT NIGHT- AND I THINK THAT IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY WANTS TO HEAR. THE VOICES OF ALL THE PANELISTS AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM FOR SPEAKING I LOOK FORWARD TO THE PART THAT WE'RE GET TODAY WITH REAL SOLUTIONS. ON HOW TO ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE YOU SHOULD NOT HAVING YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MAX OUT YOUR CREDIT CARD- AND WAITING FOR STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS TO COME- BECAUSE. IT YOU KNOW YOU NEVER. I CAN FORESEE N. DOES. OR A EMERGENCY- THAT COMES UP AS A NONPROFIT. IN THE YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY IN ORDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET IT IS THE SAME THING THAT PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING WITH. EVEN IN OUR OWN HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNTS RIGHT ROBIN PAUL TO PAY PETER. AND I THINK THAT THAT WE SHOULD PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS WE SHOULD LOOK AT. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THESE THAT. CHECKS ARE ARE A GENERATED IN A VERY RESPONSIBLE- IN A- IN A THOUGHTFUL TIME SO THESE NONPROFITS GET. CAN GET THE MONEY THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY EXPANDED AND SUPPORTED- IN WAYS OF SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY UNDERGIRDED COMMUNITY. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT ROBUST CONVERSATION BECAUSE I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME. AND I THINK AS I CLOSE WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT. OF THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF CHAIR RIVAS I DO HAVE TO PUT PRETTY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- FOR THE NON PROFITS ONE- EARLIER A FEW WEEKS AGO WE WERE CRAFTING A BILL TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT NONPROFITS QUALIFIED LIKE BUSINESSES- FOR ALL OF THE GRANT SIX CENTER THERE ARE OUT THERE BY THE STATE AND WE GOT PUSHED BACK SAYING THAT'S ALREADY THE CASE THAT WE DON'T NEED THIS LEGISLATION. SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ASK THE NON PROFITS IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCES WHERE YOU'RE APPLYING FOR GRANTS AND YOU'RE BEING TOLD- IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS YOU CAN GET IT BUT AS A NON PROFIT YOU CAN'T- IF YOU COULD CONTACT MY OFFICE AND LET ME KNOW BECAUSE- THAT SAYS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INTRODUCE IF WE NEED IT BUT AT THIS POINT TIME. OF STAFF- COMMITTEE STAFFERS INDICATED THAT THAT WE DON'T THIS THE SECOND THING IS MORE PHILOSOPHICAL BUT IF YOU LOOK AT AT THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE ALWAYS HONORED THE FOR THE SMALL FARMER WE'VE. ALWAYS HONORED TO SMALL BUSINESS PERSON. AND THE ENTERED. ARE PRETTY EASY TO WIN SUPPORT FOR POLITICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING EXCITER. WE JUST SOMEHOW HAVE NOT FOUND A WAY TO ELEVATE NON PROFITS TO THE SAME STATUS EVERYBODY LIKES HIM. BUT WE DON'T THINK ABOUT% HIM WHEN IT'S LIKE OH WE HAVE THIS ECONOMIC PROBLEM WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO FOR SMALL BUSINESS. WE HONESTLY WE'RE GOING TO FOR SMALL BUSINESS AND NONPROFITS AT THE SAME TIME. AND IF EVERYBODY THE BLUE OF THE- TALENTED- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND I SERVE RESIDENTS SENATOR- CAN ALL AND SENATORS CAN ALL HELP ME THINK ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT. I'D REALLY BE AND REALLY APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE THANK YOU. SENATOR BAKER. I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO THOSE IS ECHO WE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES AND- JUST TO THINK ALL THE SPEAKERS AND FOR THE WORK THAT THAT DAY AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS AND COUNTLESS OTHER NONPROFITS- HAVE DONE DURING THE PANDEMIC THANKS FOR THAT COMPELLING ATTEST TO MY LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING. SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS GOING FORWARD. K. CENTER LAMONT. THANK YOU AND- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT I HEARD A FEW THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TEAMS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE A DO THINK NEED ADDRESSING- AND I WANT TO POINT THOSE THINGS OUT- WEEK WE HEARD ISSUES. RELATED TO THE ZERO FIVE H. PRESCHOOLS CHILD CARE WHICH CONTINUE TO BE- AN ISSUE I KNOW THAT. WHEN YOU SPEAK TO THEM THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE THE LAST IN LINE TO HEAR WHAT THE GUIDELINES ARE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND SO- THAT THAT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN ECHOED REALLY ACROSS THE STATE. THAT WE HEARD ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND FLEXIBILITY IN CONTRACTING OVER AND OVER AND OVER DURING AN EMERGENCY- WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT IN ORDER FOR. OUR NON PROFITS TO ADAPT BE NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY IN CONTRACTING WE HAVE HAD TO ADAPT OUR OWN JOBS SO I THINK IT'S THE SHOULD EXPECT THAT THERE'S- A MORE WILL HELP. THE SAME THING IN OUR A STEEP ESPECIALLY IF THEIR CONTRACT WITH THE STATE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MUST RECOGNIZE I KNOW THAT AND A MEMBER U. S. X. REF A LETTER- THAT WENT OUT EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC THAT SEVERAL OF US YOU KNOW SIGNED ON TO- AND WE'RE PART OF THAT. THAT ASKED THE STATE TO DO THAT AND THE STATE DID- BUT CERTAINLY IF THERE ARE ELEMENTS WHERE WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB OF CONTRACT OF THE OF PROVIDING THAT FLEXIBILITY IN CONTRACTING. I WOULD BE VERY OPEN TO HEARING ABOUT. THAT- YOU KNOW. IF WE THE WAITING FOR- ANGLE INTO. IS IT IS IT EVEN TO REALLY HEARTBREAKING AND- YOU KNOW I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON. REFER TO THAT BUT THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM ASKING OUR NONPROFITS TO GO INTO DEBT BECAUSE THE STATE- IS LAGGING ON A REIMBURSEMENT I HOPE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK INTO AS THE LEGISLATURE- WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HELP OUR- NONPROFIT SURVIVE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE WAIT PERIODS ARE WHY THERE ARE SUCH LONG WAIT PERIODS- TO GET THOSE REIMBURSEMENT- FROM THE CONTRACTS I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. I BOTH WAS WORRIED BUT ALSO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE COMMENTS RELATED TO THE VOLUNTEER LABOR CHALLENGES- THE FACT THAT WE'RE LOSING TWENTY FIVE TO PART 40% OF OUR VOLUNTEERS- WHO TEND TO BE MOSTLY ELDERS- WHEN WE KNOW THAT ALSO THE PANDEMIC HAS FORCED TO YOU KNOW FOR HEALTH REASONS AND SAFETY REASONS- FOR US UP YOU KNOW FOR ALL OF US TO BE MORE CAREFUL. BUT CERTAINLY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS- THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THAT WERE LOSING VOLUNTEERS BUT I WAS OPTIMISTIC WHEN I HEARD THAT MY LABIALS. ARE THE ONES THAT ARE LIKE SIGN ME UP I WANT TO VOLUNTEER AND SO I HOPE AND THAT WE COULD ALSO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT ABOUT WHAT ARE THE WAYS THAT WE- COULD SUPPORT THAT WE COULD. YOU KNOW SIT WHETHER IT'S SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALLY OR IF THERE ARE LEGISLATIVE TOOLS THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR MILLENNIALS TO VOLUNTEER THAT SOMETHING THAT. I WOULD ALSO LOVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THEMES- WHAT WAS MENTIONED TO DATE IS NOT- THEY'RE NOT ISOLATED THINGS LIKE WE AYE I KNOW WE'VE HEARD THIS I'VE I'VE HEARD THIS- AND THESE THEMES REALLY COME UP AS WELL. AS YOU YOU TALK TO NONPROFITS ACROSS THE STATE AND SO- I APPRECIATE THERE ARE NONPROFITS STILL HANG IN THERE KNOWING AND THAT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES-AND HOPE THAT THIS ALLOWS US TO FURTHER LOOK INTO SOME OF THESE ISSUES. TO SEE HOW THE STATE COULD BE A BETTER PARTNER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LEE MY- I. WANT TO ADD ON TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY. BROUGHT UP AS AS ISSUES AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD. OF BUT ONE THING I THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE LACK OF FLEXIBILITY ON STATE CONTRACTS THAT. WE ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOMETIMES THESE CONTRACTS. DO NOT COVER THE FULL COSTS. OF THE- SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED NONPROFITS HAVE TO HAVE FUND RAISERS THEIR- FUNDRAISING GALAS IN APPEALS AT THE END OF THE YEAR. TO COVER THE GAP. I'M IN IT IT FEELS THAT WE'RE NOT VALUING. THEIR SERVICES THE SERVICES THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PAYING THEM ENOUGH TO DO IT. AND SO I HOPE THAT. WE THINK ABOUT THAT TOO IS LIKE WHAT IS THE COST TO DELIVER THESE CRITICAL SERVICES- IN TIMES OF NEED ESPECIALLY. OF A- THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT JANET WAS SAYING ABOUT THE FUNDING CLIFF AFTER FOR COVERT NINETEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE CDC. DECLARES THIS PANDEMIC OVER. AND BUT THERE'S STILL A HUGE NEED IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND HOW DO WE CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT TO GET PEOPLE BACK ON THEIR FEET BACK INTO JOBS. CHILDREN INTO PRESCHOOLS- AT CETERA AND SO I HOPE THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO PRESS. FOR THOSE MUCH NEEDED SERVICES. AND AS FAR AS VOLUNTEERS WHEN KAREN WAS TALKING. ABOUT VOLUNTEERS. I THOUGHT OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE DURING THE PANDEMIC MY OFFICE GOT SO MANY CALLS FROM CONSTITUENTS THAT. WANTED TO VOLUNTEER THEY WANTED TO HELP. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO OR WHERE TO GO- BUT WE CONSTANTLY GOT CALLS FROM YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF CONSTITUENTS THAT WERE READY. TO GO BUT- WHEN KAREN TALKED ABOUT THE COSTS TO ON BOARD VOLUNTEERS RIGHT BACKGROUND CHECKS. EVERYTHING THAT'S CONSIDERED OVERHEAD AND YOU KNOW AS A FORMER NON PROFIT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. THAT'S LIKE UNFORTUNATELY OF BAD WERE YOU DON'T WNT ALL YOUR MONEY- TO SHOW UP AS OVERHEAD RIGHT WE WANT IT DIRECTLY TO PROGRAM SERVICES BECAUSE OUR FUNDERS DEMAND THAT RATE THEY WANT. I HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF YOUR BUDGET TO BE ALLOCATED TO PROGRAM SERVICES BUT THIS IS A PROGRAM SERVICE SO HOW DO WE WORK. WITH THE FUNDING COMMUNITY INCLUDING THE STATE HOW DO WE- WORK TO MAKE SURE. THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE ABLE TO ON BOARD ALL OF THESE VOLUNTEERS TRAIN THEM AND HELP US WITH THE MUCH NEEDED SERVICES BETTER. AND THAT WE NEED DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY- I HAD ONE QUESTION FOR KAREN DELANEY OF VOLUNTEERS CENTER- I WOULD ASK WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP VOLUNTEERS BE PREPARED. FOR TIMES OF CRISIS. AND WHAT DO YOU FIND AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF USING PEOPLE'S GROWING DESIRE TO VOLUNTEER DURING THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER REQUEST FOR THAT QUESTION- YOU KNOW. THERE IS A GREAT WHEN THERE'S A COMMUNITY THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE AN ORGANIZATION LIKE OURS A STRONG VOLUNTEER CONNECTING ORGANIZATION- HANDS AND LA- HANDS ON BAY AREA THE VOLUNTEER CENTER OF SACRAMENTO THE VOLUNTEER CENTER HERE SOMETIMES IT'S THE UNITED WAY. AND SO THERE'S A GREAT UNEVENNESS FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE OURS THAT ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HARM AND OR AN ORGANIZATION THAT CAN PAY FOR THE WEBSITE AND THE TECHNOLOGY AND HELP CONNECT PEOPLE THAT'S A LEG UP SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO. IS TO TRY AND PUT SOME INFRASTRUCTURE AND I'M USING THAT TERM THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF- MAKING IT EASIER TO CONNECT LOCALLY. AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF HELPING NONPROFITS SO HELPING IT A LITTLE BIT OF INFRASTRUCTURE GOES A LONG WAY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO CONNECT TO WHERE THE HELP IS NEEDED. AND THAT'S A LOCAL OR REGIONAL EFFORT- THE OTHER THING THOUGH IS. WHEN EVERY WEEK MY- WHEN RECRUITING YOUNGER. THIS ONBOARDING COSTS I THINK THAT- AS YOU POINTED OUT. IT HAS TO BE BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION WE HAVE TO GET BETTER TECHNOLOGY I'M ONE OF THE MEMBERS MENTIONED BROADBAND WE HAVE TO GET BETTER TECHNOLOGY AND ACCESS TO. FREE QUICK BACKGROUND CHECKS SOMETHING LIKE TEXAS HAS A VOLUNTEER FAST PASS THAT THAT THAT THE THAT THEY PAY FOR WHERE ONCE I'M A VOLUNTEER GETS THEIR FREE RECORDS THEY CAN TAKE THAT. FROM AND BE ONBOARDED QUICKER SO THERE ARE THERE ARE REAL SIMPLE SOLUTIONS. THAT WILL HELP MAKE THIS PROCESS EASIER RIGHT NOW ALL OF THE COSTS ARE ON THE LOCAL NONPROFITS WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND. I AGREE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR IDEAS AND YOUR ANSWERS O NEXT. WE'RE READY TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL- OUR FINAL PANEL OF WEEK THAT IS IDENTIFYING FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT NONPROFITS DURING EMERGENCIES. WE HAVE FOUR PANELISTS THAT WILL EACH SPEAK TO US FOR FIVE MINUTES WE'LL START WITH. JOHN MASSA OKEH CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NONPROFITS ARE CAL NONPROFITS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER REQUEST AND ASKED SENATOR MONIQUE LIMON YOU KNOW IT IS REALLY AMAZING NUMBER ALL HERE TODAY WITH THESE TWO COMMITTEE SEVEN BEEN FORMED IN LEADING AND IT'S SO HEARTENING TO US NONPROFITS TO SEE. HOW MANY MEMBERS THERE ARE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN COMING TOGETHER AND MAKING THE BEST USE POSSIBLE OF CALIFORNIA'S NONPROFITS. JUST A COUPLE WORDS FIRST ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NONPROFITS TO RESTATE CAL NONPROFITS FOR SHORT WE ARE A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION WITH MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND NONPROFITS THAT ARE MEMBERS AND WE ACT AS KIND OF A CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FOR NONPROFITS. BUT MOSTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS TO PROTECT ENHANCE NONPROFITS ABILITY TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AND ALSO TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY AND ALL OF YOU WHAT THE SPEAKERS AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE TO COMMITTEES. HAVE REALLY SPOKEN TO UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF BOTH OF THESE ASPECTS. SORRY JUST RECENTLY WE-ARE OUTRAGE PARTNER FOR THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS AND NONPROFITS BB FRANCIS WELLS CALVIN USED. BY THE INCLUSION OF NON PROFITS IN THESE PROGRAMS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR LEGISLATORS. WHO MADE SURE THAT WE WERE INCLUDED- EVEN THOUGH THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE EARLY CHECK OUT SO AGAIN RICH ASKING YOUR COMMENT- WELL MISTER BENNETT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. SPEAKING OUT FROM OUR LEGISLATIVE ALLIES IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE HAD THIRTY ONE TOWN HALLS AND WEBINARS SOME OF THEM WITH MORE THAN A THOUSAND NONPROFITS PARTICIPATING. IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN LEARN AND TALK MANY OF YOU HAVE ALSO MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS OF ALL WITH ALSO PARTICIPATED. I AM THESE TOWN HALLS AND WEBINARS AND AS YOU KNOW WITH THE TO SELECT COMMITTEES WE ALSO ARE HOLDING CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT STAY IN WHICH- LEGISLATORS ARE INVITED TO HONOR AND NONPROFIT IT'S A YEAR AND THEY'RE DISTRICTS. LAST YEAR HUNDRED FOURTEEN OUT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY LEGISLATORS CHOSE TO NAME NONPROFIT CITY YEAR WHICH IS VERY EXCITING AND EVEN MORE EXCITING IS THAT THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA BE BACK IN PERSON. ON. THE CAPITOL LAWN ON JUNE EIGHTH. SO NON. SUPPORTS AND I THINK MANY THESE THINGS YOU JUST HEARD THAT WE ARE HE WROTE FIRST AND SECOND RESPONDENTS THAT WERE PART OF IT. WE ARE REALLY A CRUCIAL PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE HIRE WE HIRE LOCALLY WE SPEND LOCALLY AND WE KEEP ALL THE JOBS LOCAL WE DON'T RELOCATE TO ANOTHER STATE WE CAN'T. OUR HIGHEST PAID JOBS ARE MORE OFTEN HELD Y WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR THAN THE FOR PROFIT SECTOR. AND IS MET HAS BEEN MENTIONED BE BRINGING FORTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FROM OUT OF STATE. INCLUDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM OUT OF STATE FOUNDATIONS AS WELL AS FROM INDIVIDUAL DONORS ALL AROUND THE WORLD WE'RE SO ADMIRING OF CALIFORNIA'S INNOVATIVE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY. AND THIS CAN'T MENTION WE LEVERAGE THE ECONOMICAL THE EQUIVALENT OF A VOLUNTEER IS IN CALIFORNIA THE EQUIVALENT OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND. FULL TIME JOBS ARE ARE THAT WORK IS DONE BY VOLUNTEERS IN CALIFORNIA SO THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT WAYS THAT. SUPPORTING NONPROFITS I END UP HAVING A VERY HIGH MULTIPLIER EFFECT. SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC BUT AS OTHERS SPEAKERS AND MENTION WE HAVE A LOT OF NORMAL IF YOU WELL I'D MERGING SEES ME FALL HAD EARTHQUAKES WILDFIRES- MUDSLIDES IN DROUGHT THESE ARE KIND OF OUR USUAL EMERGENCIES- THAT. ARE ALWAYS GOING TO CONTINUE TO COME UP SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS FOR WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT WE DO. FIRST IS JUST RECOGNIZING THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT RELIEF. YOU KNOW IN JUST THE FIRST PART. OF THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF PROGRAM WHICH WE WERE A PARTNER MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED NONPROFITS RECEIVED GRANTS. OF MORE THAN NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MANY NOT ALL THE WORK THAT CONSIGLIO. AND BECAUSE OF THESE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DONE A LOT OF IT IS AND BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THAT KIND OF FUNDING. IT JUST WASN'T AVAILABLE EVEN THOUGH FOUNDATIONS. AND INDIVIDUAL DONORS WE'RE MUCH MORE TO. AND STEPPING UP THEY CAN MATCH THE POWER OF GOD TO DO KIND OF WORK. SECONDLY WE NEED REALLY FROM THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLE IN THE FIRST SET OF QUESTIONS OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE RELIEF PROGRAM THE FIRST QUESTION WAS WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE OWNER. NO THAT'S A PHRASE THAT KIND OF MADE NONPROFIT STATE MAYBE I DON'T BELONG HERE BECAUSE OF COURSE BE NONPROFITS DON'T HAVE OWNERS- WE ARE ALREADY IN EFFECT BY THE PUBLIC SO WE NEED TO LEAVE PROGRAMS THAT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. OF NONPROFITS AND MAKES SENSE TO THEM SO THAT THEY CAN SUCCESSFULLY FILL OUT THE APPLICATIONS. AS SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED WE NEED CONTRACT THAT'S ABILITY SOMETIMES FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR CHILDCARE SO. CHILDCARE CENTERS OPEN FOR THE CHILDREN OF EMERGENCY WORKERS BUT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET FOR EXAMPLE THE DELIVERABLES OF THE NORMAL MARC NORMAL ATTENDANCE RATES. UPON WHICH OUR CONTRACTS WAS DELIVERED AND OTHER TIMES WE HAVE TO QUICKLY BE ABLE TO MOVE. MONEY FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER WE SAW LOTS OF HEALTH CLINICS HAVING TO MOVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY. INTO MASKS AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT- WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH AND OFTEN THE BORI S. AND TIME CONSUMING BUDGET MODIFICATION PROCESS PROCESS. A LOT OF TIMES GOVERNMENT RELIEF ON COMES IN THE FORM OF INCOME TAX CREDITS AND BECAUSE MOST NONPROFITS DON'T PAY INCOME TAX THAT'S WHAT TAXES IT MEANS. I'M A PAYROLL TAX CREDITS ARE WHAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO LAST AND IN FACT THE E. R. T. SEATING PLAN EMPLOYEE RETENTION. SOMETHING THAT. ARE IN THE FEDERAL PROGRAM DID IN FACT USE PAYROLL TAX CREDITS AS AS WAYS OF SUPPORTING BOTH SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS AND IT'S A MUCH MORE EQUITABLE AND FAIR WAY TO PROVIDE TAX CREDITS. AND THEN FINALLY WE KNOW THAT GOVERNMENT NEEDS A ROBUST IT INDUSTRY AN ECOSYSTEM JUST LIKE WE NEED A ROBUST AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM AND SUPPLY CHAIN. WE ALSO NEED THAT NONPROFITS AND IN PARTICULAR WE KNOW THERE ARE STILL MANY DISPARITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT PARTICULARLY IF I MEAN IT GOES TO NONPROFIT AND WE'RE AREAS INTO OUR AREA AND- OF COLOR ARE SPENT. IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US. IS JUST COUPLE OF ITS- YOU KNOW- FOR ONE OF THE OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN IS THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT THE METROPOLITAN NONPROFIT HAS A RURAL NONPROFIT HAS FIFTY NINE CENTS. THAT SHOWS THE DISPARITY BETWEEN HOW GOVERNMENT FOUNDATION AND INDIVIDUAL FINDING IS- IN TERMS OF ALL OF THESE AND THEN ONE LAST THING- I MET MRS CONTRACTS THAT ALLOW NONPROFITS TO COMPETE FOR TALENT. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT THAT OUR MEALS ON WHEELS GET THAT CALIFORNIA MEALS ON WHEELS ORGANIZATIONS ARE RECEIVED. FOR A MEAL DELIVERED IS FIVE DOLLARS AND FIVE CENTS PER DELIVERED MEAL. AND IF YOU HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT GIVES YOU THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS PUSH DOWN YOUR WAGES OFTEN TO A POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T COMPETE WITH OTHERS FOR TALENT AND ALSO THAT JUST SIMPLY ISN'T FAIR TO OUR EMPLOYEES. SO ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT THAT ARE SOME THAT MANY PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE ALREADY NOW. SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU IN AT AS ALLIES TO CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THESE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING. THANK YOU. I'M NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JULIE BAKER. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIANS FOR THE ARTS. GOOD AFTERNOON TEARS REVERSAL IMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF ARTS AND CULTURE NONPROFITS IN CALIFORNIA AND FOR THIS IAUGURAL HEARING MY NAME IS JULIE BAKER MY PRONOUNS ARE SHE HER HERS AND I'M COMING TODAY FROM THE UNCEDED LAND AT THE NEVADA CITY RANCHERIA NISSAN OR NEVADA CITY CALIFORNIA. AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIANS FOR THE ARTS IN CALIFORNIA OUR TOPIC HITS THERE ARE FIFTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY ARTS CULTURE AND HUMANITIES NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA COMBINED THESE CALIFORNIA ARTS CULTURE AND HUMANITIES NONPROFITS EMPLOYS SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THREE PEOPLE EARN MORE THAN SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE EACH YEAR. WHEN HAVE ASSETS OF NINETEEN BILLION DOLLARS BUT I DON'T THINK I NEED TO SHARE THE DEBIT STATION COVER THE HOUSE CALLS FOR ARTS AND CULTURE NONPROFITS I MEAN IMPACT WAS ONLY A YEAR AGO THAT WE WERE STILL SHUT DOWN AND IT IS COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE THAT MAJOR DECISIONS MAY BE MADE IN EMERGENCIES TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IN OUR EXPERIENCE SO THERE NEEDS TO BE GREATER TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE WHEN THEY AFFECT ENTIRE SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY AND OUR COMMUNITIES. THE EFFECTS OF CODE OR LONG LASTING FOR THE ARTS AND CULTURE SECTOR NOT ATTENDANCE NUMBERS ARE NOT LIKE THEY WERE PRE PANDEMIC NOW AND EVEN THOUGH OTHER SECTORS SEEM TO BE REBOUNDING WE ARE NOT YET. IN RESPONSE TO THE CLOSURES MANY NONPROFITS. IS IT ONLINE. BUT WE KNOW THAT WITHOUT. TO THE RIGHT DISCUSSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE PROGRAMMING OUTREACH WAS NOT EQUITABLE. HOWEVER MANY COULD NOT RETREAT TO ONLINE DELIVERY ARTS PROGRAM BUT HAD TO PIVOT TO PROVIDING OTHER CRITICAL IN PERSON SERVICES AS WELL. INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION CHILD CARE AND FOOD DELIVERY. THE SKILLS ARTS AND ARTS WORKERS BRING SHOULD BRING SHOULD BE RELIED ON DURING A CRISIS. ARTISTS ARE SECOND RESPONDERS ARTS ORGANIZATIONS AND ARTISTS THING EIGHT YOU DON'T PLOY INNOVATIVE ENTERED AND FLEXIBLE. AND CREATIVE COMMUNICATORS. AS A BENTON PUBLIC GATHERING ORGANIZERS TO WE ARE TRAINING CROWD MANAGEMENT PUBLIC SAFETY AND QUICKLY BUILDING TEMPORARY STRUCTURES LIKE ONE DAY FESTIVALS. ACCESS TO THE ARTS WILL HELP US SURVIVE IN OVERCOME THE PANDEMIC AND AS WE EMERGE FROM THE CRISIS WILL BE A CHANGE SOCIETY. INVESTMENT IN THE ARTS NEED TO BE A PART OF A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH THE AFTERMATH OF THE PANDEMIC. REBUILDING CALIFORNIA WILL REQUIRE INGENUITY INCLUDING A RECKONING OF SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS SUCH AS RACISM. ECONOMIC DISPARITY. ARTS AND CULTURE NONPROFITS ARE TRUSTED COMMUNITY PARTNERS THAT UTILIZE ACCESS TO ARTS AND CULTURE AND PARTICIPATORY ART. AS A MEANS TO ENGAGE USE AND EDUCATE YOUTH BUILD SOCIAL COHESION CREATE EMPATHY. AND HEALING FROM TRAUMA THESE ARE CRITICAL SERVICES FOR OUR COMMUNITY. BUT WE ALSO LEARNED THAT ARTS WORKERS ARE VULNERABLE WORK FORCE AND THE PANDEMIC HAS HEIGHTENED THIS VULNERABILITY AND HIGHLIGHTED RACIAL INEQUITIES. AT THE HEIGHT OF THE CRISIS 63% OF CREATIVE WORKERS WERE UNEMPLOYED ONE IN TEN HAVE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AND ONE OF THREE HAVE FACED THE THREAT OF INFECTION. 55% OF WORKERS IN THE CREATIVE INDUSTRIES HAVE NO SAVINGS TO FALL BACK ON. AN ARTIST IN DENTAL FIVE FIVE TALK HAVE HIGHER RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND WHITE ARTISTS AND WANTS A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME DURING THE PANDEMIC. SO HERE RESPECTFULLY OUR SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED IN THESE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND HOW TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO ACCESS FOR NEEDED RESOURCES. LOOK TO YOUR ARTISTS AS CREATIVE COMMUNICATORS AND PROBLEM SOLVERS IN TIMES OF CRISIS. I LOOKED ARTISAN OR AND TO HELP. COMMUNITIES SECOND RESPONDERS AFTER CRISIS INVEST IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND ARTS WORKERS GIVEN THE TOOLS TECHNICAL TRAINING ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT TO BE PREPARED AND READY TO SERVE. AS A STATE OF NEW YORK JUST DID LET'S CREATE A GUARANTEED INCOME PILOT FOR ARTISTS LET'S FUND THE CALIFORNIA CREATIVE WORKFORCE ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND CREATE A NEW PIPELINE OF WORKERS WITH DIVERSITY AND LIVING WAGES AS PRIORITIES. ARE SOME PROFITS ACROSS THE STREET OR WOEFULLY UNDER CAPITALIZED WE NEED TO FIND SUSTAINED GENERAL PERATING SUPPORT AND NOT JUST SPECIAL ONE TIME PROJECTS. AND INCREASE THE STATE ARTS AGENCY CAL CORN ARTS COUNCILS BASED ON BUDGET FROM CAPITA TO ONE DOLLAR PER CAPITA. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF AB FIVE ON SMALL BUDGET PERFORMING ARTS ORGANIZATIONS AND LOOK FOR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY TO AFFORD HIRING WORKERS WITH LIVING WAGES FOR THESE VITAL COMMUNITY BOTH BASED CULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS. THEY WERE NOT THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL BUT THEY ARE THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE. GRANTMAKING SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE AND NOT DESIGNED FOR ORGANIZATIONS WITH FULL TIME PROFESSIONAL GRANT MAKERS. GRANT APPLICATIONS NEED TO BE STREAMLINED AND MADE COMMON ACROSS AGENCIES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND FUNDING NEEDS TO BE RELEASED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AS YOU'VE BEEN HEARING. IN ADDITION GRANT PERIOD SHOULD BE OPEN LONGER UNTIL THE FUNDS ARE EXPENDED AND INSTEAD OF CLOSING ON A HARD STOP DATE. MANY ARTS ORGANIZATIONS ARE UNDERSTAFFED OR EXPERIENCING THE REHIRING AND DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPLY WITHIN THREE WEEKS AS OFTEN THEY ARE ASKED WE ALSO SUGGEST CREATING A STATEWIDE EQUITY GOVERNMENT GRANTS REVIEW PANEL. MADE UP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT APPLIED DUE TO EITHER MISTRUST FOR LACK OF CAPACITY TO REVIEW CURRENT GRANT APPLICATIONS. GRANT SHOULD BE ALWAYS BE AMOUNT AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES TO REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BUT AT LEAST ALL SERVICES SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE IN SPANISH. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT ALTHOUGH NONPROFITS PROVIDE ECONOMIC IMPACT LIKE A SMALL BUSINESS THEY ARE ALSO DIFFER IN SO OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUNDING NEED TO TAKE TO ACCOUNT. THE NONPROFITS ARE NOT EASILY CHARACTERIZED BY NEXT CODES AND FISK AND THAT FISCAL SPONSORED ORGANIZATIONS UNDER A LARGE- LARGER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY. ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE SPACE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LIVING WAGES ARE CRITICAL ISSUES ARTS NONPROFITS AND ARTS WORKERS. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND FOR INCLUDING ARTS AND CULTURE AS A NONPROFIT PROFITS AS PART OF THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH- OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JENNIFER HARK CO. DO YOU WANT TO ASK A QUESTION. GO AHEAD ASSEMBLY MARKETS YEAH I WANNA SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IF YOU COULD PLEASE- SUBMIT YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY WRITING BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO EXTRACT SOME OF THE IDEALS AND SOLUTIONS THAT YOU'VE ARTICULATED I THINK THEY'RE VERY GOOD SOLUTION SO THAT'S THE ONLY POINT I WANT TO MAKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON POINT. THANK YOU WE'RE LEARNING SO MUCH FROM ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS AND GETTING IDEAS- MAYBE FOR FUTURE LEGISLATION- OTHER- OR YOU KNOW THIS YEAR YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR ARMED TOMORROW IS OUR INTRODUCED OUR BILL INTRODUCTION DEADLINE SO I KNOW SOMEONE FOR GIBSON'S ALREADY MAKING A LIST HERE RIGHT OF ALL THE IDEAS YEAH I HAVE MY OWN LIST TOO SO- THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR LEADERS- NEXT. JENNIFER HART CEO OF PEOPLE ASSISTING THE HOMELESS PATH. THANK YOU COACH JERRY BASS AND CO CHAIR LIMÃ“N AND ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN TODAY. MY NAME'S JENNIFER HER KEITH AND I'M HONORED TO BE THE CEO OF PATH. HOW DOES THE NONPROFIT HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDER AND HOUSING DEVELOPER WE STARTED BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND LOS ANGELES AND I'VE GROWN TO BE ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS IN THE STATE BATTLING THE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS. DAY WE NOW HAVE OVER SIXTY LOCATINS WITH MAJOR COMMUNITY HUBS IN SACRAMENTO SANTA BARBARA LOS ANGELES LONG BEACH ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO. WE CURRENTLY HAVE OVER TWENTY ONE HUNDRED AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS COMPLETED OR IN THE PIPELINE. AND OUR MISSION IS TO END HOMELESSNESS FOR INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. WITH CLOSE TO A THOUSAND STAFF SERVING OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS A YEAR COVERED NINETEEN IMPACTED US GREATLY. TODAY I WANT TO FOCUS ON TWO AREAS FOR OPPORTUNITY AS WE LOOK AT HOW THE PANDEMIC IMPACTED THAT AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS LIKE WE'VE HEARD TODAY. AND HELP US PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE. ONE AREAS ARE WORKFORCE AND THE OTHERS ARE OF THE CONTRACTING CHALLENGES. I WILL START WITH THE CHALLENGES WE'VE SEEN MAINTAINING OUR WORKFORCE. GOING BACK TO MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE LOCKDOWN OCCURRED WE KNEW INSTANTLY THAT WE WERE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. I CAN STILL REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE I WAS WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS OF THE SHUTDOWN AS I'M SURE MANY OF YOU CAN AS WELL. BUT WHAT THIS TRULY MET FOR US WAS THAT AS THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS FIGURING OUT HOW THE IMPLICATIONS WOULD. WORK WITH THEIR FAMILY OR HOW THEY WOULD MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS WITH FOOD AND PAPER GOODS SHORTAGES. OUR ENTIRE TEAM HAD TO THINK THROUGH THIS FOR THOUSANDS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS WE SIR. AND WE DID. OUR TEAM SET UP THIRTEEN NEW INTERN HOUSING SITES IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS. MANY OF THEM WITHIN DAYS OF TOURING THE FACILITY. WE KNEW THAT IT WAS TRULY LIFE OR DEATH. HOWEVER AND THIS TOOK A GREAT TOLL ON THE STAFF WITH OFTEN LITTLE OR NO COMPENSATION INCREASED. IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT OUR SECTOR IS SEEING A SIGNIFICANT TURNOVER. ONLY SERVICE HAS ALWAYS HAD A HEALTHCARE ROLE. ENTERING HOLDEN WE REALLY PUSH THAT TO THE LIMIT WITH COMMON POSITIVE PARTICIPANTS PROVIDING TESTING BREEDING THOSE ESSENTIAL ITEMS INTO THE COMMUNITY. WITHOUT A LOT OF TRAINING WITHOUT IDENTIFYING WHAT EXPERTISE THEY NEEDED. AS AN EXAMPLE WE HIRED OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY PEOPLE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE. WE HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN STAFF LEAVE THE ORGANIZATION AND WE DO AN EXIT INTERVIEW WITH EVERY PERSON. ALMOST ALL OF THEM CITED THEY WERE LEAVING OUR SECTOR. AND THE MAJORITY OVER 75% OF THE SEPARATIONS AND BARELY BEEN WITH US HERE. SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INVEST IN THE STAFF WHO NEVER GAVE UP TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE OUTREACH RUN INTERIM HOUSING AND BE THE HOPE FOR PEOPLE WHO OFTEN DON'T HAVE ANY. WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR WORK FORCE DIFFERENTLY AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THE WELLNESS PROGRAMS AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT OUR TEAMS RIGHTFULLY DESERVE. AND THE SECOND AREA WE WANT TO FOCUS ON IS REALLY PREPARING AROUND OUR CONTRACT CHALLENGES. THE FIRST ONE IS PAY EQUITY AND I THINK IT REALLY TIES INTO THE WORK FORCE CHALLENGES. HEALTHCARE IS ONE OF THE LEADING INDUSTRIES PEOPLE ARE LEAVING. WE NEED TO PROVIDE A LEAVE LIVING WAGE WHERE PEOPLE CAN LIVE AND WORK IN THE SAME COMMUNITY. AND OUR STAFF CAN NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SAME SERVICES THAT THEY OFFER PARTICIPANTS. WE DON'T WANT TO PERPETUATE POVERTY. THIS HAS COME TO LIGHT EVER EVEN MORE THAN EVER DURING THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. BY SETTING ANNUAL INCREASES FOR MULTI YEAR CONTRACTS. AND SETTING PAY STANDARDS BY REGIONAL COST OF LIVING STANDARDS. THIS CAN HELP RETAIN STAFF IN OUR FIELD. ANOTHER ITEM AS DAN MENTIONED IS FULL COST FUNDING. TRULY PAYING FOR THE FULL COST OF PROVIDING THE SERVICE. OFTEN NONPROFITS HAVE TO FUNDRAISE TO COVER EXPENSES CONTRACTS DO NOT PROVIDE. LET'S FUNDRAISE FOR INNOVATION NOT BASIC MEANS. DURING KOBE AND WE HAVE HAD JANITORIAL COSTS TRIPLE IN SOME OF OUR INTERN HOUSING AND SHELTER FACILITIES. WITHOUT ANY INCREASE GOVERNMENT REVENUE. CONTRACTS NEED TO BE RE EVALUATED FOR TRUE COSTS THERE NEEDS TO BE CONTRACTED BEYONCE'S WE SHOULD NOT BE WAITING FOR LENGTHY REIMBURSEMENTS AND SOME OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND FIGURE THIS OUT. ADDITIONALLY ALLOWING FLEXIBILITY BETWEEN THE LINE ITEMS IT'S BEEN STATED SPECIALLY DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY WOULD ALLOW US OFTEN THE SAFETY NET AND COMMUNITIES TO ADAPT TO THE EMERGENCY WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT CLOSING OUR DOORS. WE NEED TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAPACITY BUILDING I KNOW THAT NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO FUND CAPACITY BUILDING. BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT THIS WOULD GREATLY INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND QUICKLY. MANY OF US GREW DURING THE PANDEMIC NOT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO BUT BECAUSE WE ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE. AND YET THIS QUICK GROWTH CAUSES A RACE TO KEEP UP WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NEEDED TO SUPPORT OUR PROGRAMS. THE SUMMARIZE WE LEARNED SO MUCH DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGES. NOW WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY- THAT WILL BETTER PREPARE US FOR THE FUTURE. SO LET'S NOT GET STUCK UNPREPARED AGAIN LET'S PLAN FOR THE NEXT EMERGENCY BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN OUT MORE THAN EVER. THAT WE WILL NEED TAX SWIFTLY AND THEN OUR NONPROFIT SECTOR WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU JENNIFER- OUR LAST SPEAKER ON THIS PANEL. WE HAVE DOCTOR LEON DROPPED CLARK HARVEY CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH I AM ACTUALLY NOT A THIRD PARTY AND IDEOLOGIST AND I AM C. O. C. H. I. WE REPRESENT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE TO OR AGENCIES THAT SERVE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ANNUALLY AND THERE'S BEEN SOME REALLY ILLUMINATING DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT NONPROFITS PROVIDE AND I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THE PEOPLE BEHIND THEM SERVICES. THE ROIC INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK DAY IN AND DAY OUT TO PROVIDE THESE ESSENTIAL SERVICE SO OUR MEMBERS HAVE BRAVE THIS PANDEMIC TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO SO MANY WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS BUT IT'S COME AT A COST IT'S COME AT A COST TO THEIR PRODUCTIVITY THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY AND MANY AGENCIES ARE ON THE BRINK OF CRISIS DUE TO THE VERY SEVERE WORK FOR SHORTNESS OF BREATH. SENATE CVHS THE STATE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION HAS A FIFTEEN OUR MEMBERS WITH GRANTS FOR TELEHEALTH EQUIPMENT PP AND CONSTANT ADVOCACY BUT MORE IS NEEDED THE EXTRA PAINTING IS NOT PLEASANT BUT THE STORY HAS TO BE TOLD AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE TO FIND SOLUTIONS SO THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL AND OUR PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE RETAINED. AND RECRUITED AND CLIENTS ARE SERVED TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE FACING A UNIQUE SET OF CHALLENGES AND IT'S NO SURPRISE TO MANY HERE THAT AT THE HEART OF IT ALL ALL IS FINANCING. IN ORDER TO SURVIVE OUR AGENCIES EXIST. OFTEN VERY FUNDING SOURCES. FOR MANY THEIR POWER. PHONE STREAM COMES KANT WITH BE HEALTH DURING THIS CRISIS SOME OF OUR COUNTY PARTNERS HAVE WORKED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY WITH UP FRONT PAYMENTS IN NEGOTIATE SHIPPING CONTRACTS AROUND REIMBURSEMENT RATES. BUT THERE IS GREAT INCONSISTENCY LEAVING SOME OF OUR MEMBERS TO QUESTION IF THEY CAN SURVIVE OFF OF EXISTING RATE. HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY COLLEAGUES FROM OTHER SECTORS TODAY WORKFORCE HAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE OUR TOP PRIORITY POLICY AT PRIORITY AND WHILE WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE FLEXIBILITY THAT HAVE BEEN AFFORDED WITH THE USE OF TELEHEALTH. THERE ARE ALSO CHECK ALLEN JEFF IT IS NOT THE BEST MODALITY FOR ALL POPULATIONS AND WITH THE SURGEON BEHAVIOR HEALTH TECHNOLOGY WHAT DO YOU IT WARRANTS GREATER SAFEGUARDS AND QUALITY CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE I'M CONSUMER NOTE. IF AN APP IS GOOD OR NOT OR WILL SOLVE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CARE ADEQUATELY AND INDICATEIF THEY HAVE A TRUE DENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. AND MANY PRIVATE TECH COMPANIES ARE NOW RECRUITING STAFF FROM THE PUBLIC BE ABLE TO HELP. BECAUSE OF OR RATES AND AN ABILITY TO PAY THEM WHILE. CBO STAFF ARE UNDERPAID THERE OVER WORK YET THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO CREATE MORE PEOPLE HEALTH NEEDS. TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND HIS PARENTS TRANSITION BACK TO WORK. FOR THOSE AGENCIES WHO ARE LOOKING TO BE CALM CERTIFIED TO PROVIDE MEDICAL SERVICES I'VE HEARD FROM MANY ESPECIALLY BY PARKS SERVING AGENCIES IN SMALL AREAS THAT SOME ENCOUNTER BARRIERS IN A CUMBERSOME CERTIFICATION PROCESS AT THE STATELEVEL. AND OUR STATE HAS NOT BEEN THE MOST FRIENDLY TO OUT OF STATE PROVIDERS WHO LOOK TO YOU TRANSACTION ARE LICENSES THE CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO BOLSTER ARE ALREADY LACKING WORKFORCE. LAST WHEN WE LOOK AT WHO POPULOUS ARE WORKFORCE THEY WERE NONPROFITS LEAD THE WAY WITH BOARD DIVERSITY HAS BEEN SHARED EARLIER WE NEED TO INCREASE THE EVEN MORE SO FROM THE BOARDS OF OUR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO THE CLINICIANS AND. THE CLIENTS THEY SERVE SO IN SOME THERE'S AN OF ISSUE THAT I'VE OUT. BY HERE ARE SOME. ONE ARE. NEED TO HAVE TO GO. RATE LET ME BUT THERE CAN TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES MINIMUM WAGE THE DIRE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AND TO ALLOW FOR MORE COMPETITIVE WAGES FOR RETAINING AND RECRUITING WORKFORCE. OUR STATE SHOULD EXPLORE FLEXIBILITY EVEN LICENSE RECIPROCITY WITH NEIGHBORING STATES. WE NEED QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSESSMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGY. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT BARRIERS TO BECOMING A MEDICAL PROVIDER OR ELIMINATED AND WE NEED TO INVEST IN RECRUITMENT HAVE DIVERSE NONPROFIT BOARD. LEADERSHIP AND STAFF. NOW WE REALIZE THAT THE SOLUTIONS CANNOT BE PERSONAL LOAN BUT ONLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH. ANY STATE AND EVEN PRIVATE SECTOR ALLIES. AS THE CHAIRWOMAN SO IS TO LEAVE COMMENTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING NONPROFITS ARE THE HEART AND THE BACKBONE BUT WE'VE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. AND AS MICHAEL PRISONER FROM THE FIRST PANEL STATED NONPROFITS ARE A POWERFUL FORCE FOR EQUITY WE ARE IN A PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CRISIS AND WE NEED OUR ESSENTIAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NONPROFIT PROVIDERS. READY TO ASSIST US WITH THE EMOTIONAL TOLL OF THIS PANDEMIC THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING. THE STATE OF AFFAIRS OF NONPROFITS. THANK YOU SO MUCH ARE. ALL GREAT PRESENTATIONS WITH GREAT IDEAS- FOR US AND FOR WHAT THE STATE CAN DO BETTER TO SUPPORT.

WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN THANK THINK FOLKS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW LISTENING TO TWO OF TWO THIS LAST PANEL- CERTAINLY A FEEL LIKE. TRYING TO IDENTIFY HOW WE ADDRESS THE ISSUES- OF REIMBURSEMENT RATES IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT- ADDITIONALLY THE DIFFERENCES I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY ONE OF THE- DATA PIECES THAT WE SHARED. THAT TO- TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW IN IN KIND OF RURAL. COMMUNITIES IN ITS FIFTY NINE CENTS TO THE DOLLAR FOR WHAT URBAN NONPROFITS GET AND I'M A AND MAY HAVE GOTTEN THAT SLIGHTLY INACCURATE BUT I THINK THAT. THAT'S WHAT MY NOTES SAY THAT'S WHAT I TOOK DOWN. AND THAT'S VERY REAL BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER CHALLENGES THAT COME IN SO- I KNOW FOR THOSE OF US THAT HAVE SOME. RURAL COMMUNITIES WE CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT AS WELL- AND WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW. EVEN WITHIN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR- HOW WE HEAR HOW WE ADDRESS EQUITY ISSUES- BECAUSE THE ISSUES ARE CERTAINLY DIFFERENT- BUT THERE ARE. BUT POOR IS POOR WHETHER YOU'RE IN URBAN OR WHETHER YOU'RE IN RURAL. IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD FOOD ON THE TABLE THE FEELING IS VERY SIMILAR RATE IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD- I HEALTH OVER YOUR ROOF- THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT YOU- AS WELL SO- I LOOK FORWARD TO. AGAIN IN FUTURE ECONOMY IN. FUTURE- HEARINGS AND INFORMATION CAN HAVE A DIALOGUE TO INCLUDE THOSE TWO ITEMS IN OUR DISCUSSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU I OF COURSE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THIS PANEL AND WE KEEP HEARING THE RECURRENT ISSUE OF REIMBURSEMENT FROM STATE CONTRACTS AND- THE DELAYS. UNFORTUNATELY FOR OUR NON PROFITS TO RECEIVE THIS FUNDING THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT UP FRONT SOMEHOW EITHER THROUGH CREDIT LINE OR ANOTHER WAY- AND- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE PRESENTERS TALKED ABOUT. OFFERING POTENTIALLY A PAYROLL TAX CREDIT TO NONPROFITS WE DO THAT A LOT IN THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE OFFER TAX CREDITS. INCOME TAX CREDITS TO INDUSTRIES THAT WE WANT TO KEEP IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE THINK ARE CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA- A YOU KNOW WE WANT THAT IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT FOR NON PROFITS. AND YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING YOU KNOW I SERVE ON THE ASSEMBLY REVAN TAX COMMITTEE SO I HEAR ON THESE BILLS. R. AS IMPORTANT BUT WE NEED TO THIS IS ONE WAY TO ELEVATE THE NONPROFIT SECTOR AND ALSO CONSIDER THEM AS IMPORTANT AS OTHER INDUSTRIES IN OUR AND OUR JOINT AUTHORS. OKAY OKAY. AUTHORS HERE.

M. IT TO THAT ALSO I THOUGHT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NONPROFIT WORK FORCE AND SUPPORTING YOU KNOW LIKE EVERY LIKE LOTS OF OTHER INDUSTRIES. THIS INDUSTRY IS ALSO FACING A WORK FOR SHORTAGE OR YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE. ARE BECOMING LESS MOTIVATED BECAUSE OF THE CONDITION THE WORKING CONDITIONS. AND THE STRESS THAT. OF ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT. THEY MAY BE FACING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT. PEOPLE STILL WANT TO ENTER THE NONPROFIT SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW THAT IT IS. A VERY REWARDING CAREER- FOR ALL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR OLDER PEOPLE- EXPERIENCED WORKERS- SO THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING ALL OF THESE ISSUES- TO BOTH PANELS.
