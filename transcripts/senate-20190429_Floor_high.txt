FORTY ONE THIS ESOLUTION COMMEMORATES HOLOCAUST MEMBERS MURMURED STAY OR YOUNG HIGH SO I AS YOU MUST SHOW AS WE SEE IN HEBREW WHICH JEWS AROUND THE WORLD WILL COMMEMORATE. ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. HI YOU KNOW I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN I WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT. TWENTY YEARS AGO. TO WALKED THE HALLOWED AND GO STILL GROUNDS ABOUT SHADES. AND IT WAS ONE MOST POWERFUL DAYS OF MY LIFE AND I WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO. THIS YEAR [inaudible] AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE THAT THE SAME DARK FIRE THAT LED. THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND AND MANY OTHER. MINORITY FOLKS TO THE GAS CHAMBERS AT THE END OF THOSE TRAIN TRACKS WOULD CONTINUE TO FLICKER. HERE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY TODAY. IN OUR BEAUTIFUL CITIES LIKE CHARLOTTESVILLE [inaudible] PITTSBURGH. AND NOW POWER WAY. IN OUR OWN STATE. IT'S THE SECOND SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING IN SIX MONTHS. REMINDS US THAT WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY LEARN THE LESSONS OF THE HOLOCAUST. JUST YESTERDAY MEMBERS OF OUR CAUCUS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WERE ABLE TO MEET WITH SURVIVORS AT THE LOS ANGELES MUSEUM OF THE HOLOCAUST IN A ELECTION. WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT? THEIR EXPERIENCES WE HEARD HORRIFIC STORIES. ONE THAT IS STRUCK ME. SO MUCH MORE NOW THAT I HAVE A CHILD THAT. WHEN THE STORY THAT WAS REPEATED TO US WAS OF A MOTHER? WHO WAS LITERALLY BALANCE TO HER TWO DAUGHTERS? BY THE RIVER BANK. AND SHOT BECAUSE THE **** SOLDIERS IN ONE AND WASTE. THREE BULLETS. THIS PARTICULAR SURVIVOR WAS ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS WHO HAPPEN TO MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVED. AND WE WERE TOLD BY THE SURVIVORS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST WE'RE NOT TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YEARS AGO WE'RE TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE SAME. SPARK OF ANTI SEMITISM. THAT LED TO THEIR DEATHS THAT CONTINUES TODAY [inaudible] SO [inaudible] MEMBERS. THE THE THE SAD THING IS THAT WE'VE BEEN FAILING THESE INCREDIBLE HEROES THESE THESE SURVIVORS ACCIDENT OR SEMITISM IN AMERICA HAVE INCREASED BY OVER 60% SINCE. TWENTY SIXTEEN ALONGSIDE A RISE IN ACTS OF HOMOPHOBIA TRANSPHOBIA SEXISM RACISM. XENA PHOBIA AND ISLAMOPHOBIA. THESE BIASES ARE SYSTEMIC. I WAS NOT LOST ON ME THAT THE GREAT INSPIRATION OF THIS. TROUBLED YOUNG MAN WHO SHOT UP THE SYNAGOGUE IN POWAY. WAS THE SHOOTER IN CHRISTCHURCH WHO SHOT? AT IT IS IN MUSLIMS. IN THEIR MáS IN THEIR HOUSES OF WORSHIP. THE SATURDAYS THEY WERE FEELING OUR NEXT GENERATION A STUDY CONDUCTED JUST LAST YEAR REVEALED THAT TWO THIRDS OF MILLENNIALS. DON'T KNOW WHAT OUTFITS WAS. ALMOST A QUARTER HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD OF THE WHOLE COST. THAT'S WHY COMMEMORATIONS LIKE THIS. AND LIKE THAT WHICH IS GOING ON OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE RIGHT NOW ARE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL. AFTER THE IMAGES CIRCULATED OF THE ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS MARKING **** SALUTES AND CELEBRATING AROUND CUTS ARRANGES SWASTIKA. THE LOS ANGELES MUSEUM OF THE HOLOCAUST INVITED THOSE SEEM STUDENTS TO THEIR MUSEUM. AND FOLLOWING THEIR VISIT THE STUDENTS WROTE HEARTFELT LETTERS. EXPRESSING THEIR REMORSE IN THEIR NEW FOUND UNDERSTANDING OF THE DANGERS. OF THEIR ACTIONS. SO THERE ARE SOME REASONS FOR OPTIMISM AND HOPE BEFORE ABLE TO PUT. THE TIME IN THE ENERGY IN THE RESOURCES INTO THESE KINDS OF THIS KIND OF WORK. THE JEWISH CAUCUS REMAINS COMMITTED TO LIFTING UP STORIES THE HOLOCAUST YEAR AFTER YEAR TO EDUCATE TO HONOR AND TO REMEMBER. WE HONOR THOSE WHO LOST EVERYTHING YET PERSISTED IN REBUILDING. WE HONOR THE RIGHTEOUS YOUR WRIST EVERYTHING TO PROTECT OTHERS. WE HONOR THE LIBERATORS WHO LEFT THEIR HOMES. AND RISK THEIR LIVES TO ENTER A WAR IN PURSUIT. OF UNIVERSAL FREEDOM. I WE REMEMBER WE REMEMBER THE CONSEQUENCES OF SENSELESS HATRED. THE JEWS AND OTHER MINORITY COMMUNITIES. ARE OFTEN TARGETS THE COMPASSION CAN CHANGE THE WORLD. PLEASE JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING I. C. R. FORTY ONE TO HONOR AND REMEMBER THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF THE HOLOCAUST. OF PITTSBURGH IN A POWER WAY. AND OF ALL HATE MOTIVATED VIOLENCE IN TO USE THESE LESSONS IN OUR FIGHT. AGAINST INJUSTICE EVERYWHERE. I ASK YOUR RIVAL [inaudible] CENTER PAN. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENTE SENATOR SAW ON BEHALF OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS YEAR -- FORTY ONE AND TO ESTABLISH CALIFORNIA HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY AND WHY THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SANTA MONICA FOR HIS ELOQUENT WORDS IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW THEM -- YOU KNOW THE DARKEST MOMENT OF THE PAST CENTURY TWENTIETH CENTURY ADOLPH HITLER LETTER GENOCIDE THAT RESULT IN THE SENSE OF DEATH. OF ONE MILLION PEOPLE. IN THIS RESOLUTION ENSURES OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THIS UNFORTUNATE. WELL THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT -- TRAGEDY IN OUR WORLD HISTORY. AND WE NEED TO LEARN THIS HISTORY SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT GENOCIDE LIKE THE HOLOCAUST NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. WHAT WE SAY NEVER FORGET WE MUST REMEMBER TO SURVIVORS OF THIS HORRIFIC TRAGEDY ARE PASSING AWAY? AND SO WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT OUR GENERATION AND THE GENERATIONS THAT FOLLOW MUST KEEP THE MEMORY ALIVE. IS UNFORTUNATE THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE OUT THERE WHO WOULD DIMINISH THE SUFFERING OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE. WHO WOULD DENY OR EVEN MOCK THE HOLOCAUST AND FORTUNATE SEEN THIS HAPPEN? BUT THIS DAY IS ABOUT RECOGNIZING THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE NEEDED TO FIGHT INJUSTICE. JEWISH AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS PLAYED A CYNIC SIGNIFICANT ROLES COALITION PARTNERS WITH JAPANESE AMERICAN WORKSTATIONS AND ADVOCATING REDRESS FOR JAPANESE AMERICAN INTERNMENT. THIS WEEK'S VIOLENCE SHOOTING AT A SYNAGOGUE ON PO A IS A TRAGIC AN URGENT REMINDER THAT WE MUST NOT KEEP SILENT. IN THE FACE OF BIGOTRY AND HATRED. WE MUST STAND UNITED ACROSS ALL FAITHS AND BACKGROUNDS AND WORK TOGETHER. BY SPEAKING OUT FOR PEACE AND FOR JUSTICE. SO I TO URGE -- THAT WOULD COME TOGETHER AND VOTE HI ON THIS RESOLUTION SO WE CAN REFLECT BOTH ON THE LIVES IN THE MEMORIES. OF PEOPLE LOST IN THE HOLOCAUST AND AGAIN DEDICATE OURSELVES TO SAY NEVER AGAIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SAID PAN SENATOR JACKSON'S. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I RISE. AT THIS MOMENT ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS THE CAUCUS OF MOTHERS SISTERS DAUGHTERS. GRANDMOTHERS ARMA PRABHA. TO SIX WONDERFUL GRANDCHILDREN. SOME OF WHOM HAVE EXPERIENCED. THE HATRED OF ANTI SEMITISM UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM THAT IT EXISTED EVEN AS YOUNGSTERS HATRED AND BIGOTRY. THAT MANY OF US I WOULD SUSPECT MOST JEWS HAVE AT SOME TIME OR ANOTHER IN THEIR LIVES EXPERIENCED. BEING CALLED THE KITE TAKEN OUT OUR GARBAGE. WHEN I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD? BY THREE CHILDREN I HAD NEVER MET BEFORE MY LIFE -- THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO GO AWAY. WE HAVE HATRED AND BIGOTRY IN OUR SOCIETY WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCUMB TO THE WORST OF THEIR FEARS AND THEIR IGNORANCE AND THEIR INTOLERANCE. TO BRING UP THE BASIS STAND US WE SAW THAT IT POWER WAY WE SAW THAT A TREE OF LIFE WE'VE SEEN THAT IN SRI LANKA WE'VE SEEN AT ALL AROUND THE WORLD. BUT I RISE TODAY IS A JEW BECAUSE ANTISEMITISM IS A SCOURGE ON HUMANITY THAT HAS GONE ON FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. I RISE TODAY AS A TRUE. AND AS A WOMAN TO RECOGNIZE AND REINFORCE THE FACT THAT ONLY SEVENTY YEARS AGO. A DEMAGOGUE NAME ADOLF HITLER PERSUADED PEOPLE HUMAN BEINGS. THAT JEWS WERE A PLAGUE ON THE WORLD. AND TOGETHER WITH THEIR ACQUIESCENCE MURDERED SIX MILLION JEWS. AND SEVEN MILLION OTHER PEOPLE FROM GYPSIES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMOSEXUAL PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE GRADE ARIAN RACE. AND SO WE'RE HERE SEVENTY YEARS LATER. AND YET ANTI SEMITISM HASN'T GONE AWAY [inaudible] CHAU. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT HAPPENED SEVENTY YEARS AGO BECAUSE SHOWS GOOD SENATOR FROM SACRAMENTO REMINDED US. PEOPLE MARKED THE FACT OF THE HOLOCAUST. I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WHO HAD NUMBERS WRITTEN ON THE INSIDES OF THEIR ARMS AND I WILL TELL YOU ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE IN THEIR IN HUMANITY DID THIS IS BECAUSE IN THE JEWISH RELIGION BEING MARKED. IS A AN ACT AGAINST GUARDS SO YOU WON'T SEE TOO MANY JEWS WHO HAVE TATTOOS AND ALL. IT WAS A SYMBOL OF DISRESPECT. SO THE GERMANS JUST TO MAKE SURE THE CHOOSE NEW. THAT THEY WERE LESS THAN HUMAN. PUT NUMBERS. ON THE INSIDE OF THE ARMS OF JEWS WHO WENT THROUGH. THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS. AND IN FACT IF YOU HAVE. SUCH A TATTOO. IN ORTHODOX RELIGIOUS SIR OF THE CEMETERIES YOU CAN'T BE BURIED. BECAUSE THAT WAS A VIOLATION OF CAUGHT. SO THERE WERE EXEMPTIONS GIVEN BECAUSE OF COURSE THESE WERE NOT PEOPLE WHO CHOSE THE FIND THEMSELVES TATTOOED WITH NUMBERS. AND IF THEY WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SURVIVE. THE PRISON CAMPS IN THE IN HUMANITY THEY SUFFERED THE LAST INDIGNITY THAT THEY SHOULD EVER HAVE TO SUFFER. WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO BE BURIED WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN THE CEMETERIES OF EUROPE. SO A REMINDER. THE **** REGIME TARGETED ALL JEWS. RUSSIA KILLED OVER A MILLION JEWS. MY ANCESTORS HAD FORTUNATELY LEFT RUSSIA. DURING THE POGROMS ANOTHER SPIRIT OF ANTI SEMITISM THAT HAPPENED IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN NINETIES IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS AND I WOULD SUBMIT. THAT A GOOD PORTION OF THE JEWISH POPULATION IN THIS COUNTRY. CAME DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME SO MY FAMILY WAS LUCKY TO GET OUT BUT NOT ALL MY FAMILY GOT OUT. I HAD FAMILY IN POLAND. THEY DIDN'T LEAVE. FAMILY IN RUSSIA THE DIDN'T LEAVE AND THEY WERE MURDERED. BY THE GERMANS. DURING THE WAR SO I HAVE A PERSONAL CONNECTION AS I SUSPECT AS WE DO. FIND OUR DNA SO MANY OF YOU HERE IN THIS ROOM SURPRISINGLY WILL DISCOVER THAT INDEED. YOU HAVE ANCESTORS WHO ALSO WERE JEWISH. BECAUSE WE'RE ALL ONE HUMANITY. AND THE FACT THAT WE FORGET THAT IS PART OF THE REASON WE NEED TO REMEMBER IT HERE TODAY SO. NOT ONLY DID THEY TARGET JEWS BUT THEY PARTICULARLY SUBJECTED WOMEN BOTH JEWISH AND NON JEWISH TO IN HUMANE TREATMENT AND ABUSE. WOMEN MADE UP TO MILLION A OF THE ESTIMATED SIX MILLION JEWS WHO WERE KILLED IN THE HOLOCAUST. WOMEN DEEMED CAPABLE OF WORKING WERE FORCED INTO DEPLORABLE WORKING CONDITIONS WHICH OFTEN THEMSELVES RESULTED IN THEIR% DEATHS PREGNANT WOMEN AND MOTHERS OF SMALL CHILDREN. WERE SEEN AS IN CAPABLE OF WORK AND WERE SENT TO THE KILLING CENTERS TO MEET WITH THE TRAGIC UNTIMELY DEATH IN THE HANDS. OF THE AGENTS OF THE GENOCIDE MANY THEIR WITH THEIR CHILDREN. SEEING THEIR CHILDREN COLLAPSE IN THE GAS CHAMBERS AND THEN THEY THEMSELVES DYING AT THE HANDS OF THESE. ATROCIOUS MURDERS. GERMAN PHYSICIANS AND MEDICAL RESEARCHERS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF JEWISH AND ROMA WOMEN AS SUBJECTS OF ON ETHICAL HUMAN EXPERIMENTATION INDEED DR MENGELE LAW WAS HISTORICALLY KNOWN AS SOMEONE FASCINATED BY TWINS. I HAD COUSINS APPARENTLY WHO WERE TWINS TWELVE YEAR OLD TWINS WHO WERE THE SUBJECT OF MEGALIS EXPERIMENTS AND OF COURSE DIED IN THE PROCESS. BECAUSE HIS INTEREST HIS FASCINATION WASN'T WITH HUMANITY. IT WAS WITH HIS DISTORTED VIEW OF SCIENCE [inaudible] GERMAN PHYSICIANS. EXCUSE ME BEATINGS AND RAPE WERE ALSO COMMON OCCURRENCES IN GHETTOS AND CONCENTRATION CAMPS. BUT THESE WOMEN LIVING IN UNIMAGINABLE CONDITIONS WERE RESILIENT. MANY WOMEN IN CONCENTRATING CONCENTRATION CAMPS BANDED TOGETHER IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. IN POLAND SOME WOMEN SERVICE CAREERS OF INFORMATION TO CHOOSE IN THE GHETTOS. WOMEN LED MANY RESISTANCE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE GHETTOS WHILE OTHERS TRIED TO RESIST WITHIN THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS HIMSELF. AT AUSCHWITZ. FIVE JEWISH WOMEN SUPPLIED THE GUN POWDER THAT MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH SPECIAL DETACHMENT AND AJ WHICH BIRKENAU. USED TO BLOW UP THE GAS CHAMBER AND KILL SEVERAL SS MEN DURING THE UPRISING IN OCTOBER. NINETEEN FORTY FOUR THESE WOMEN HOLD LEGACIES OF COURAGE AND BRAVERY. IN THE RESISTANCE OF THE ****. SO WE REMEMBER WE SHARE THIS BECAUSE WE DON'T EVER WANT IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. THE **** REGIME. AND THOSE LIKE IT OR NOT UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS OF HISTORY. IF WE DO NOT STOP THE HATE THE INTOLERANCE THE FEAR. THAT EXIST IN OUR NATION AND IN OUR WORLD WE WILL REPEAT. THIS KIND OF EVENT AND WE WILL CHOOSE THE JEWS AS THE FIRST GROUP TO HATE. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WE MUST BE BETTER THAN THIS AND ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE. JEWISH CAUCUS ON BEHALF OF LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IS A BARBER. AS A MOTHER IS THE DAUGHTER. I ASK ALL OF US TO JOIN IN AND NOT TRUSTS SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. WHAT TO ACT IN THE SPIRIT OF COMPASSION AND LOVE? FOR ALL OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. THANK YOU MISS PRESS. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON FOR THOSE WORDS SENATOR WIENER.

OF MILLENNIA OF VIOLENCE AND GENOCIDE -- TOWARDS -- JEWISH COMMUNITY -- WEATHER AND OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE WHETHER DURING THE MIDDLE AGES WHETHER IN EASTERN EUROPE. FOR RUSSIA WHEN MY FAMILY TO FLOOD RUSSIA AND EASTERN EUROPE TO ESCAPE THE POGROMS WHEN ENTIRE VILLAGES. WERE BURNED DOWN -- SO THIS GENOCIDE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOREVER ANTISEMITISM IS ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE OLDEST FORMS OF HATRED -- AND IS WITH US TODAY AND IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN. I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND -- THAT ALTHOUGH -- SIX MILLION OF THE VICTIMS LOG COSTS FOR JEWISH OF COURSE OTHER COMMUNITIES WERE IMPACTED INCLUDING THE LGBT COMMUNITY -- THE LGBT COMMUNITY HAS ALSO BEEN THE SALT OF COURSE THE SUBJECT OF EXTREME VIOLENCE AND EFFORTS TO ERADICATE US FROM THE FACE OF THE PLANET -- GOING BACK -- FOREVER -- AND IT'S STILL HAPPENING TODAY RECENTLY YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT BROUGH NAY -- ISSUED A NEW LAW ARE PASSED A NEW LAW THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI -- ARE CALLING FOR STONING -- OF ANYONE WHO IS -- LGBT -- SO -- THIS VIOLENCE THIS EFFORT TO A RADICALLY ENTIRE COMMUNITIES -- IT'S NOT NEW -- BUT THE HOLOCAUST WAS IN THE ALTERNATE COMBINATION OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN WHEN A CON MAN WHEN WE COME OFF OF THE TRACKS AND WE ALLOW. THIS FEATURE THE SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER CENTER DORADO. THANK YOU. TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA.

SOLEMN IN A WAY THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN -- YOU KNOW I A I GREW UP ON THE EAST COAST IN A RURAL COMMUNITY THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF DIVERSITY.
