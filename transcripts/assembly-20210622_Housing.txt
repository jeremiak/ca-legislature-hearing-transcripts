MORE HOUSING IS GETTING BUILT FOR EXAMPLE- THERE WAS A GREAT PROJECT IN SAN FRANCISCO CALLED THE SHIRLEY CHISHOLM VILLAGE SB THREE THIRTY HELPED SHAPE SIX MONTHS OFF THAT PROJECT TIMELINE SO THAT CONSTRUCTION STARTED SIX MONTHS EARLIER AND AS WE KNOW TIME IS MONEY SO WHEN- HOW ARE PROJECTS ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS CAN BE BUILT TO PROMPTLY THEY ARE BUILT AT MORE COST EFFECTIVELY NOW. SB EIGHT EXTENDING THE PROVISIONS OF THE HOUSING CRISIS ACT FOR THOSE OF YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THAT ORIGINAL BILL THIS JUST GREEN LIGHTS HOUSING THAT ALREADY MEETS LOCAL RULES SO THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE EXISTING RULES IN OTHER WORDS- WHATEVER ZONING RULES LAND USE AUTHORITIES AND SUCH THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PUT INTO PLACE ARE RESPECTED. IT JUST SAYS THAT WHEN A APPLICANT SUBMITS A PROJECT THAT MEETS LOCAL RULES IT HAS TO BE DONE WITHIN A CERTAIN TIMELINE AND THE RULES CAN'T CHANGE MID STREAM WHILE THEY'RE PROCESSING THAT PROJECT- AND THE BENEFIT OF THAT IS ESPECIALLY IN THE CRISIS THAT WE ARE IN NOW THE HOUSING CRISIS WE ARE IN NOW WHERE WE IT IS ESTIMATED THAT WE ARE THREE MILLION FEWER UNITS THAN IS NEEDED- THIS REALLY IS A BAY IF IT BECAUSE- IT GIVES CERTAINTY TO THE APPLICANT. AND HELPS PROCEED WITH THE HOUSING WE SO DESPERATELY NEED NOW THE BILL THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS BILL. AND THREE THIRTY IS THAT THERE'S SOME CLARIFYING OF TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS THAT BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF IMPLEMENTING THREE THIRTY SO FAR SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS INTERACTED WITH US AND SAID YOU KNOW. A COUPLE OF THESE DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES NEED CLARIFICATION SO WE- DID THAT SO THAT IT'S- THERE GIVES THEIR CERTAINTY IN NO CONFUSION AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO MY WITNESSES AND I'VE GOT BEFORE YOU DO COULD WE ESTABLISH A FORM BEFORE MISS CLARK SILVA WALKS OUT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MATHIS MINIMUM FRAZIER- THAT IS WE'VE GONE OVER FIFTEEN MINUTES OF THIS TIME SO WE'RE GONNA BROWN WE HAVE ONE LAST PARTY OKAY THANK YOU WE'LL WE'LL DO THAT ONE LAST PARTY. THANK YOU NINE FOUR FIFTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY I GUESS SO. WE ARE CAN NO MORE COMING THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITH THAT LET US BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS COLLEAGUES. ANY QUESTIONS. TO THE MOISTURE. CENTER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING YOUR BILL TO US TODAY AND I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO HEAR IT- YEAH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LOT OF THE COMMENTS I HEARD WERE ACTUALLY ALMOST ADDRESSING WHETHER WE SHOULD BE APPROVING SB THREE THIRTY THAT IS IN FACT LAW RIGHT NOW. IN ALL THIS IS AN EXTENSION TWO THREE THIRTY. BUT MY QUESTION IS THE SUNSET FOR THAT IS IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND SO IT ONLY HAS HAD A YEAR OF NORMAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. AND THEN COATED. TO BE ABLE TO GET A FULL FLAVOR FOR THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT THIS MAY HAVE. OR ANY OF THE BENEFITS THAT IT MIGHT HAVE- THAT WAS INTENDED FOR. AND THAT SO MY QUESTION IS WHY ARE WE TRYING TO DO AN EXTENSION FOR SOMETHING THE SUN SETS. IN FOUR YEARS WHEN WE COULD WAIT ANOTHER TWO OR THREE YEARS TO SEE IF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMMER NOT- OR IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT MIGHT WANT TO BE. ADDRESSED IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO ATTEMPT TO EXTEND THIS AND ALSO WHY FOR THE ENTIRE FIVE YEARS FROM TWENTY FIVE TO. TWENTY THIRTY- BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE FOR ME- I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION VERY GOOD QUESTION- WHEN WE FIRST. THE WHEN I SAID IT DOESN'T CHANGE LOCAL LAWS. IT ABSOLUTELY RESPECTS THE ZONING THE DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS THE LAND USE POLICIES THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS AT THE POINT THAT IT BECAME LAW WHICH WAS JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY. AND IT IN EFFECT HOLDS THOSE IN PLACE WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS BUT IT HOLDS THOSE IN PLACE THEN FOR THE PERIOD THE BILL'S EFFECTIVE AND AS YOU POINTED OUT MY PURPOSE TODAY IS TO HOLD THOSE IN PLACE FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS TILL TWENTY THIRTY AND PARTLY BECAUSE DURING THE PANDEMIC AS MANY OF US KNOW. MANY OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- PERMIT ISSUING OFFICES IN EFFECT CLOSEST AND THEY'RE PLANNING COMMISSIONS- ZONING BOARDS DID NOT MEET YOU KNOW JUST LIKE WE DID EVERYBODY WAS ADJUSTING TO THE PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS ALSO A HALT ON CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES FOR AWHILE. SO THE REASON I WANTED TO ALLOW IT THIS BILL TO HAVE MORE TIME IS BECAUSE THE HOUSING CRISIS IS STILL HERE ALL OF THE REASONS WHY THREE THIRTY WERE NEEDED STILL REMAIN AND- THAT WHEN WE- NOTWITHSTANDING THE VARIOUS CRITICISMS THAT SOME OF THE CALLERS CALLED IN THIS ONE REALLY JUST SAYS IF THERE IS A HOUSING AN APPLICATION THAT MEETS YOUR RULES LET'S JUST GIVE IT SOME TIME CERTAIN FOR THE PROCESSING AND THEY'RE STILL YOU KNOW LOTS OF PUBLIC HEARINGS THAT ARE ALLOWED AT LEAST FIVE FOR EXAMPLE. AND THERE IS- THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE PROJECT APPLE APPLICANT FOR YOU KNOW THINGS TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS THERE'S NOTHING THAT PREVENTS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM DOING THAT BUT WHAT THIS DOES IN THE BENEFIT OF EXTENDING IT IS IT IT LEAST GIVES AN APPLICANT THE CERTAINTY BECAUSE AS WE KNOW TO PUT ALL THE MATERIALS TOGETHER THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OFTEN REQUIRED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HAVE YOU'RE A PROJECT HEARD ITS THIRD THOSE ARE EXTENSIVE AND THEN IN THE PROCESS OF THOSE HEARINGS AS YOU'RE NEGOTIATING CHANGES TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY CONCERNS YOU ALSO SOMETIMES HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. SO WE KNOW THAT EVEN WITH THE CERTAINTY AND THE TIME FRAMES THAT THIS BILL- PROVIDES. ARE AT PRIVATE YOU KNOW HOUSING IT TAKES A WHILE SO IT WAS REALLY IN RECOGNITION OF THAT WE HAD THIS PAUSE SO LET'S GIVE THIS THING THE CHANCE TO REALLY WORK AND THEN IT SUNSETS. AND IF WE FEEL THAT IT DIDN'T WORK WE CAN NEVER BRING IT BACK. OR AS YOU SUGGESTED IF THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS ISSUES WE CANNOT JUST MIDSTREAM BUT SO FAR IN YOUR RIGHT THERE HASN'T BEEN THE WHOLE FIVE YEARS FOR IT TO APPLY BUT SO FAR. THE MAIN ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP OR WORSEN THINGS AROUND THE DEFINITIONS AND WE INCORPORATED THOSE IN THE TECHNICAL CLARIFICATIONS AND WE GOT THOSE DIRECTLY FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SO WE HAVE ADDRESSED THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT TO US AND AS YOU HEARD IN THE CALLS YOU DIDN'T HEAR MANY CITY YOU HEARD. RESIDENTS COMPLAINING BUT YOU DID NOT HEAR CITIES OR COUNTIES CALLING IN OPPOSITION NOW CITY OF LA WE'RE TALKING THEY HAD A FEW I GET GAN TECHNICAL. DEFINITIONS THAT THEY MAY WANT US TO ADDRESS WHICH WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM RIGHT NOW BUT OTHER THAN THAT YOU DID NOT HEAR CITIES. BUT WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE BILL THAT THE- THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CALLING HALF. APPRECIATE THAT NOW ALSO UNDER THIS UNDER THE CURRENT BILL- AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR APPLICATION AND BY THE LAST DAY OF THE SUNSET CLAUSE. YOU'RE PROTECTED BY THE BILL RIGHT RIGHT SO THEY HAVE TO- TWENTY TWENTY FIVE UNDER THE CURRENT LAW TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO FAR I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATIONS YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU CALL SAID COMMENTS MS WORKS. I THINK YOU I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD- I THINK FRANKLY YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS IS TOO SHORT FOR ITS ORIGINAL INCEPTION- WE HAVE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS WITH PRODUCTION IN THE STATE AND ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO INCREASE MY PRODUCTION ACROSS THE BOARD I THINK IS CRITICAL- WE HAVE AN OBVIOUS MENTION. MISMATCH ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I THINK IT'S A THOUGHTFUL PIECE OF POLICY- AND WOULD LIKE TO COULD YOU SEE T MOVE FORWARD IN AND HAVE- LOCAL FOLKS BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. CHECK OUT TO BE MOTION. OKAY IS OUR SECOND. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THE AUTHOR APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK LIKE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY I ALSO THOUGHT THAT THE INITIAL TIME FRAME WAS TOO SHORT I THINK WE ALL COULD WISH THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS WOULD BE OVER IN A COUPLE YEARS- BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN A FEW YEARS- BEFORE IT IS ADDRESS CERTAINLY WITH. CONTINUED OPPOSITION TO BUILDING HOUSING AROUND THE STATE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SET THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT THAT THEY ARE CLEAR- AND- THAT THEY ARE IN PLACE FOR MORE THAN A FEW YEARS SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AND LET ME ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENTS. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASSED THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHU HI CHIU ICE AIRTEL NUMBER IN THEIR TURN NOT VOTING GABRIEL GABRIEL I KALRA KILEY MAIENSCHEIN QUICK SILVA. RIGHT QUICK SILVA AYE WICKES. WICKES I. THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES THANK YOU WE WILL. WAIT FOR OTHERS TO VOTE. FILE ITEM TO S. B. TWO NINETY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR SO THIS BILL. LIKE I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST A REPEAT PERFORMANCE OF MY LAST BILL WAS IN EFFECT TO EXTEND SOMETHING THAT WE HAD ALREADY PASSED THIS ONE IS A BILL THAT SUCCESSFULLY PASSED YOUR FLOOR LAST YEAR WITH SIXTY SEVEN. VOTES THIS IS THE EXACT SAME BILL THE ONLY ISSUE WAS THAT IT DIDN'T IF WE WERE UNABLE TO VOTE ON IT IN THE SENATE ON THAT LAST DAY BECAUSE WE HAD THE MIDNIGHT DEADLINE- BUT IT IS EXACT SAME BILL SO I HOPE THAT YOU WOULD- APPRECIATED AND SUPPORTED AS WAS DONE LAST YEAR. AND IT MAKES JUST SOME TWEAKS TO OUR DENSITY BONUS LAW TO HELP- IMPROVE ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND INCORPORATE THE ABILITY TO INCLUDE STUDENT HOUSING IN THE DENSITY BONUS LAW. AND WITH THAT I WILL ASK MY WITNESSES DAVID GARCIA FROM UC BERKELEY STERN- CENTER AND PATRICK KENNEDY FROM PANORAMIC INTEREST TO- PERCENT. TO THE WITNESSES. AND THE OPERATOR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA I AM THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE JURORS ENTERPRISING INNOVATION AT UC BERKELEY WE ARE HOUSING RESEARCH AND POLICY ORGANIZATION AT BERKELEY THE FOCUS IS REALLY ON ALL MATTERS OF HOUSING RELATED ISSUES FROM OUR THANK YOU THE COST OF BUILDING- TO- TO BARRIERS TO CONSTRUCTION. AND TODAY I'M HERE TO TEST. THERE SKINNER IN PRINCIPLE BECAUSE OUR WORK HAS SHOWN THAT THE DENSITY BONUS LAW SHOULD BE REFORMS TO ENCOURAGE GREATER USE SPECIFICALLY. SOME RESEARCH WE PUBLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN ARE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL LAND USE SURVEY. FOUND THAT FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS REPORTED TO US THAT THEY HAD NO GET THE BONUS USAGE WHATSOEVER. AND OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT TOLD US THAT THEY DID HAVE FIFTY DOLLARS PROJECTS MOST OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS REPORTED HAVING. ONLY ONE OR TWO DOCUMENTS PROJECTS DURING OUR THREE YEAR SURVEY PERIOD- IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT CHANGE TO THE DENSITY ONCE ARE NEEDED TO INCREASE ITS USAGE TO DRIVE NOT JUST MORE HOUSE CONSTRUCTION OVERALL. BUT ALSO DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT CRITICAL TO NINETY. IMPORTANT TARGETED STEPS TO IMPROVE THE UTILIZATION OF THE DENSITY BONUS LAW BY EXPANDING OUR HOMEOWNERSHIP CONCERT HOUSING PROVISIONS WHICH ARE BOTH. CRITICAL AREAS OF NEED THESE ARE REALLY SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD REFORMS THAT COULD HELP NUDGE MORE BUILDERS TOWARDS USING THE DENSITY BONUS IN MORE PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE MISSING PART OF THE CHANGES BECAUSE MOST DON'T HAVE SELECTED THANK SENATOR. AFTER WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER KENNEDY. YES THANK YOU MY NAME IS PATRICK KENNEDY AND I'M THE OWNER PANORAMIC INTERESTS- DEVELOPMENT FIRM THIS BEEN DEVELOPING INFILL HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA SINCE- NINETEEN NINETY- I WAS FIRST DEVELOPER TO USE THE DENSITY BONUS IN BERKELEY IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE FIRST OF ALL OF HER TO USE THAT THE PRODUCTS AND CISCO. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- AND I'D LIKE THAT AND THE RESULTS IN BOTH CITIES HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER DEVELOPERS THAT HAVE USED THE DENSITY BONUS TO BILL- MORE HOUSING AFFECTED BERKELEY HAS SEEN SEVERAL HUNDRED IN FACT I THINK CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND NEW UNITS OF HOUSING FELT. ALMOST ALL OF WHICH WERE A DENSITY BONUS AND I THINK THE LAST FIFTEEN PROJECTS IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVE YOU THAT'S THE BONUS LOS WELL SO IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL- AND IT'S SIMPLE TO ADMINISTER- IT'S IT SUCCEEDED BEYOND I THINK ANYONE'S MACHINATIONS. ALTHOUGH IT WAS SMALL SLOW IN COMING THE REVISIONS THAT- THAT SENATOR SKINNER ARE PROPOSING TODAY ADDED ADDITIONAL VALUE TO THE DENSITY BONUS ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA STUDENT HOUSE- I'M VERY FAMILIAR WHICH DID NOTHING AT BUILT IN BERKELEY AND SAN FRANCISCO ARE KIND OF MASTERPIECES WITH UC BERKELEY CALIFORNIA COLLEGE OF THE ARTS DISCARDED INSTITUTE AND OTHERS AND A SIGNIFICANT- I THINK. IN DENSITY BONUS LAW HAS BEEN THE INABILITY OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT ARE CREATED WITH THE DENSITY BONUS- SENATOR SCANNERS- REVISIONS- CORRECT THAT AND PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE. TO BUILD DEDICATED STUDENT HOUSING IN CITIES THAT MADE. IT OUT BERKELEY IN PARTICULAR. I HAVE THE- TO OF. AND THERE ARE WHO IN CARS- IT- THIS LAW SB NINETY TO A WONDERFUL.

THANK YOU. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN I'LL SUPPORTING SB TWO NINETY PLEASE CONTINUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET IS NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. COLLEAGUES ANY DISCUSSION. THERE'S BEEN I'M THE MOTION MOVING TO SECOND- LET ME JUST SAY TO THE AUTHOR I THINK MANY OF US SUPPORT OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR GLAD THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK AND- I THINK I WILL SAY THIS CONTRARY TO. MANY OF THE SUGGESTIONS- FROM SOME OF THE FOLKS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC DENSITY BONUS HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO ACTUALLY CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION IT SO IT'S A UNIQUE TOOL THAT INCENTIVIZES FOLKS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING- TO ENCOURAGE THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING- IN THE WAYS THAT IT'S BEEN STRUCTURED SO THAT REALLY IS THE GOAL OF THIS- SO I HAVE TO MATT I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED BY SOME OF THE COMMENTS- BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THAT- LET ME ASK IF THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS MISS CORK SILVA. YES I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING IN THE SPACE RELATED TO HOUSING- THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF CONCERN AS WE HEARD ON THE LINES BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE LOOK AT HOUSING AS A WHOLE AND WE LOOK AT WHETHER IT'S MARKET RATE WHETHER IT'S AFFORDABLE. AND EVEN WITH THE HOMELESS CRISIS SHELTERS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW FOR SURE. IS THAT WE'RE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH. WE HAVE PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS. ARE ON ALMOST EVERY CORNER IN SACRAMENTO BUT THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. BUT THIS ALSO ADDRESSES STUDENT HOUSING AND MORE AND MORE WE'RE SEEING EVEN IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES I REPRESENT NORTH ORANGE COUNTY- WITH FULLER TEN COLLEGE. IN MY CITY THAT I LIVE IN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS CYPRESS COLLEGE. AND THE PRESIDENTS OF THOSE COLLEGES HAVE BEEN ASKING. US FOR QUITE A LONG TIME FOR US TO START TO ADDRESS.UP COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE THINK ABOUT FOUR YEAR COLLEGES R. C. ISSUES ARE UC'S AND MANY TIMES THEY HAVE HOUSING ON CAMPUS. MANY TIMES THEY WORK FOR PRIVATE DEVELOPERS. BUT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE STUDENTS ARE MANY TIMES ARE LEFT OUT OF THESE EQUATIONS- MANY TIMES WE ASSUME THAT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS OR JUST GOING TO REMAIN LIVING AT HOME. AND AS WE'VE SEEN THAT IS NOT ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES STUDENTS HAVE BEEN HIT EXTREMELY HARD THIS YEAR WITH ENROLLMENT ACTUALLY WAY DOWN. PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE THEY HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK. BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES HAVE LOST JOBS SO THIS BILL I THINK CAN AND WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THIS HOUSING THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. BACK TO THE CENTER FOR ANY FINAL WORDS. THANK YOU CHAIR AND- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THOSE WHO WERE CALLING IN JUST NEVER EVEN SUPPORTED THE ORIGINAL CALIFORNIA'S ORIGINAL DENSITY BONUS BILL. I WOULD SAY THAT THEIR COMMENTS REGARDING THIS BILL WOULD REFLECT NOT A CAREFUL READ BECAUSE THE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT THE REALLY SIGNIFICANT FEATURE OF THIS BILL IS TO ALLOW. STUDENT HOUSING TO BENEFIT FROM THE EXISTING LAW AND THE ONLY REASON STUDENT HOUSING COULDN'T BENEFIT IN THE PAST IS BECAUSE STUDENT HOUSING IS CONFIGURED DIFFERENTLY AND OUR LAW OUR REGIONAL ALWAYS BASED ON- SOMETHING WITH A KITCHEN. AND YOU KNOW EITHER STUDIO OR OR- ONE OR TWO BEDROOM OR WHATEVER BUT IT HAD TO HAVE A DISTINCT KITCHEN. AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT STUDENT HOUSING IS OFTEN CONFIGURED WHERE THERE IS A COMMON KITCHEN FOR MULTIPLE FLOORS OR KITCHEN PER FLOOR. AND THAT THE UNITS ARE REALLY MORE LIKE STUDIOS BUT WITHOUT A KITCHEN AND SO THIS BILL JUST ALLOWS FOR WHAT WE KNOW IS THE CONFIGURATION OF STUDENT HOUSING. TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM DENSITY BONUS AND IF THEY IF THE PROJECT IS DEDICATING A CERTAIN PERCENT OF THE UNITS. OF IN THAT PROJECT FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS FOR LOW IT YOU KNOW MOVED PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEN IT WOULD BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE DENSITY BONUS LAW SO IT'S REALLY IT'S KEY FEATURE AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHIELDS HI CHIU AYE SEROTONIN FARED THEY ARE TO AYE GABRIEL. GABRIEL I KALRA. KILEY KILEY AYE MAIENSCHEIN. A QUICK SILVA ALL RIGHT QUICK SILVA AYE WICKS. THAT BILL HAS FIVE VOTES YOUR BILL IS PASSED. THEY HAND WITHOUT THANK YOU SENATOR LET'S NOT GO TO FILE ITEM THREE SB NINE BY THE SENATE. AS A PRETEND TONI ATKINS- HERE WE HAVE TO PRESENT THE BILL- THE CHAIR OF THE- SENATE GOVERNMENT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE CENTER MCGUIRE SOME OF OUR GOOD TO HAVE YOU. MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON GET SITUATED HERE. THE CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR GOOD TO SEE YOU MISTER CONSULTANT GOOD AFTERNOON I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR SINCERE ENGAGEMENT IS ALWAYS ON ALL LEGISLATION AND WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE VERY CAPABLE HOUSING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. AND MEMBERS I KNOW THAT THIS BILL MAY LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR AS THE PROTEIN- ADVANCED SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY LAST SESSION- WE TOOK A GOOD BILL THAT MET THE FATE OF A HARD DEADLINE LAST YEAR AND AFTER LISTENING TO FEEDBACK FROM HOMEOWNERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SHE IMPROVED UPON. SB NINE PROMOTES SMALL SCALE NEIGHBORHOOD DRIVEN RESIDENTIAL OPTIONS STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR A HOMEOWNER TO CREATE A DUPLEX OR SUBDIVIDING EXISTING NOT IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR UP TO FOUR UNITS YEAH RIGHT NOW STATE LAW PROVIDES FOR THE ABILITY TO BUILD THREE UNITS SINGLE FAMILY HOME JD YOU AND EIGHTY U. S. B. NINE STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL IN CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT IN OPPORTUNITY- UP FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A SMALL SCALE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE SO. BADLY NEED TO BE A COMBAT OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS WE NEED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND HOMES EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA TO KEEP UP WITH CURRENT DEMAND RIGHT NOW WE'RE BUILDING EIGHTY THOUSAND HOMES IF WE TOOK AB TAKE A LOOK AT L. A. COUNTY ALONE IN THE NEXT RINA CYCLE L. A. COUNTY WILL NEED ONE POINT THREE MILLION. UNITS NOW THERE ARE SOME EXEMPTIONS IN THIS BILL THAT I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO OUTLINE. NUMBER ONE THIS BILL WILL NOT APPLY TO HISTORIC AND AS WELL AS LANDMARK DISTRICTS. CAN'T BUILD ON WETLANDS ON PRIME AG LAND YOU CAN'T BUILD CAN'T BUILD IN FLOOD ZONES IN IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO POTENTIALLY DEVELOP AN INTERNAL CORPORATE AREA YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR PROGRESS. PERCOLATION TEST. NOW THI BILL ALSO PROTECTS NEIGHBORHOODS FROM SPECULATION. AND GENTRIFICATION AND IT COULD OPEN UP THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL UNITS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO THAT MISTER CHAIR. IF YOU DON'T MIND. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD DEED RESTRICT THESE UNITS TO ENSURE THEIR AFFORDABILITY. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT. AFFORDABILITY IN THIS BILL BUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER THIS BILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO DEED RESTRICT. ANY OF THE DUPLEXES ON FOUR PLEXUS AT THAT WOULD BE TRANSITIONED- IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THAT WOULD MEAN CITIES AND COUNTIES COULD COUNT THESE UNITS AT TOWARDS THEIR NEXT AFFORDABLE HOUSING CYCLE OVER THE NEXT DECADE. MISTER CHAIR THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AS WELL AS BRIDGE HOUSING ONE OF THE LARGEST AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS. IN THE STATE SUPPORT SB NINE. NOW THERE'D BEEN SOME STUDIES ON- EIGHTY USER LIKE TO DISCUSS BECAUSE- ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS ARE ALMOST THE EQUIVALENT TWO DUPLEXES. I'D LIKE TO FIRST TAKE A LOOK AT THE SAME DISCO BAY AREA AND LOOK AT SEVEN CALIFORNIA. SO THERE IS A STUDY ON THE AVERAGE RENTAL PRICE OF AN EIGHTY YOU IN THE EAST BAY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. AND WHAT THAT STUDY SHOWED IS THAT EASY TO USE ARE AFFORDABLE HAVE AFFORDABLE RENTS TO SOMEONE MAKING 62% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. NOW WHY IS THAT CRITICAL WELL RIGHT NOW UNDER OUR STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WITH THE ADDICTION NOR MORATORIUM. WE PROVIDE RENTAL ASSISTANCE UP 280% OF AREA MEDIAN INCOME FOR TENANTS LIVING IN HOMES. AND IF WE LOOK AT SOMETHING CALIFORNIA IN THE AFFORDABILITY. IN L. A. COUNTY RIGHT NOW SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. TWO THIRDS OF ALL ALL. USE IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. COULD BE RENTED BY A RESIDENT WHO IS IN THE LOWER INCOME CATEGORY. TWO THIRDS IF WE LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY IT 68% OF ALL EXCESSIVELY DWELLING UNITS IN IN THIS BUDGET THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I TO BE ABLE TO HELP FINANCING OF ADDITIONAL EIGHTY USE THIS BILL ALSO FOCUSES ON STRONG TENANT PROTECTIONS- YOU CAN'T TURN TO TRANSITION A SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE TO A DUPLEX IF A TENANT HAS LIVED IN THE DWELLING FOR THREE YEARS YOU CAN'T EVEN DO A LOT SPLIT- IF A TENANT HAS LIVED IN THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME FOR THREE YEARS. INCREDIBLY STRONG TENANT PROTECTIONS LOADED INTO THIS BILL IT'S BEEN A PRIORITY FOR ME SACKINGS NO ONE MODIFICATION IS THAT THIS BILL COMPARED TO LAST YEAR PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE AUTHORITY TO ENACT AN OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS THAT'S BEEN A VERY CLEAR AND LOUD- PIECE OF FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- SO THERE IS AN ABILITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO ENACT A OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS ANOTHER AMENDMENT MADE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE NUMBER OF UNITS ARE ALLOWED ON THE LOT. IS FOR IN ONLY FOUR. SO THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION THAT YOU COULD BUILD FIVE YOU CAN BUILD SIX YOU COULD BILL TEN. UNDER THIS BILL. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE YOU CAN BUILD FOR IN ONLY UP TO FOUR. YOU CAN'T DOUBLE DIP. IF A HOMEOWNER HAS A SINGLE FAMILY HOME A. G. EIGHTY YOU AND IN EIGHTY YOU ON A LOT NOW YOU CAN'T GO BUILD ANOTHER FOUR UNITS. IT'S CLEAR IN THIS BILL. IN THIS BILL IS ALSO OPTIONAL IT DOESN'T FORCE HOMEOWNERS TO DO ANYTHING IT'S AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION. THIS MERELY OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HOMEOWNERS TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE WORKFORCE HOUSING THAT WE ALL TALK ABOUT EACH AND EVERY DAY THAT EACH OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL SO DESPERATELY NEED. AND I'D SAY TO THOSE WHO MAY ARGUE THAT THIS COULD JEOPARDIZE THE LOOK OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AROUND US IN OUR COMMUNITIES THERE ALREADY ARE BEAUTIFUL DUPLEXES- IN EXCESS OF THE DWELLING UNITS NEXT DOOR TO TRADITIONAL SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN SOME OF OUR STATE'S MOST SOUGHT AFTER ZIP CODES. EITHER CHARMING HOUSES THAT ARE NOT ONLY A BRIGHT SPOT ON THE BLOCK BUT A COMFORTABLE PLACE FOR NOT JUST ONE. BUT TWO FAMILIES TO CALL HOME. ALONG WITH SAFEGUARDS IN THE PRO OUT OF THE PROTEINS BILL AND I TO QUICKLY DISCUSS THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDES FOR FAMILIES TO HAVE MORE OPTIONS TO BUILD MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSING. AND BUILD MULTI GENERATIONAL WEALTH. INTERJECTION G. INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH IS A CURRENCY WE ALL KNOW- THAT IS CRUCIAL TO COUNTERING THE INEQUITY- IN CREATING SOCIAL MOBILITY. AND WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IS A CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER ONE MISTAKE. AND NOW THIS IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN NEIGHBORHOODS WERE OUTDATED ZONING LAWS HAVE CREATED BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP AND OF LED TO OVERCROWDING. THIS BILL PROVIDES HOMEOWNERS WITH OPTIONS PROVIDE RENTAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER WORKING FAMILIES WHO MAY BE STRUGGLING TO FIND A HOME IN THEIR PRICE RANGE OR WHO MAY BE LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN PATH TO MORE AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. OR CANDIDLY SOMETHING THAT MY WIFE AND I ARE LOOKING AT A POTENTIALLY MOVING IN OUR AGING MOM TO BE ABLE TO LIVE RIGHT NEXT DOOR. THIS BILL IS THE. EXPANSION FOR OPPORTUNITIES. OPPORTUNITIES FOR. HOMEOWNERS RENTERS IN FAMILIES ALIKE. THE HOUSING CRISIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS SO LARGE IN THE STATE THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A SINGLE SOLUTION NO BILL WILL BE A SILVER BULLET. BUT THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY SENATE BILL NINE IT'S A CRITICAL PIECE TO THE HOUSING PUZZLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE PROGRESSIVE AND POSITIVE CHANGE IN STRENGTH IN THE FABRIC OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WITH EQUITY INCLUSIVITY MOST IMPORTANTLY AFFORDABILITY MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE THE STATEMENT TODAY I HAVE WITH US TODAY A LEASE BUTTE. WITH UNITED WAY LA AND WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT WARRANTY VALENCIA SANCIOUS IS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION AND THANK YOU MEMBERS. FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANKS VERY MUCH OUR CENTER DID YOU SAY WANT TO WIN ASSISTANCE ACTUALLY EUROPE THE PROFESSION BE ON A TELECONFERENCE ON THE CONFERENCE SIGNS TO THE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE ALLOW THEM TO SPEAK. THIS IS ONLY AIR CANADA KAY THANK. YES YOU CAN. OKAY GREAT I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS THE LEAST BE WRECKED I AM THE PRESIDENT AND THE CEO OF UNITED WAY OF GREATER LOS ANGELES AND I'M HERE TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR SB NINE- THE WAY THAT OUR RELATIONS WITH THE BUSINESS WE NARROW THAT LAND USE POLICIES ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS DRIVEN RACIAL CONGREGATION AND WEALTH DISPARITIES FOR DECADES. WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS DRIVING OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AND THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BEARING THESE BURDENS. MOST IMPORTANTLY EVERY CENT REPORT LAST MONTH BY THE LA CITY PLANNING DEPARTMENT FOUND. THAT IN HIGH INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS ONLY 20% OF DOWNING IS ALLOWING MULTI FAMILY HOMES WHERE THEY LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS THAT'S EIGHTY PERCENT. WE THINK THAT THERE IS A DISPARITIES ARE NOT MUCH LOCKED AND. AND WHAT ARE NEIGHBORHOODS A BOOK LIKE. WE BELIEVE THAT AS NINE ON BALANCE BETWEEN RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL. AND CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL SCALE NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL BENEFIT THE BROADER COMMUNITY. WE RECOGNIZE SB NINE WILL NOT SOLVE OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS ON ITS OWN AND SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON CONTINUE TO PRESS FORWARD ON ALL FRONTS. FROM INCREASING RENTER PROTECTIONS TO INCREASING PUBLIC FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SUBSIDIZE HOUSING FOR WORKING AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND WE'RE PROUD TO BE WORKING ON MANY OF THOSE ISSUES WITHIN YOU. UNITED WAY OF GREATER LA STANDS WITH LEADERS HERE WILLING TO REJECT THE STATUS QUO AND ENVISION A FUTURE WHERE EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA HAS A SAFE AND STABLE HOME WITH THE DELEGATE TRIED. SO I WANT TO EXPRESS MY DEEPEST GRATITUDE TO FOR THAT PER TEN TINY ACTIONS FOR YOUR COURAGE ENERGY THING THIS BILL AND TO EACH OF YOU WHO IS GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. AND IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LAUREN TABLE ANTI ARE REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO JOIN SENATE PRO TEM ATKINS AND TODAY PLAN TO ACQUIRE IN SUPPORT OF THE NINE. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY CONTINUE TO BE AMONG CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRESSING ISSUES ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY CAUSES OF THE HOUSING CRISIS. WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS SOME OF WHICH PLANNERS HAVE CREATED PLAY A PART. UNDER CURRENT LAW A MAJORITY OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS CAN ONLY BE FOUND FOR SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING THAT'S WHEN IT HOUSING SUPPLY AND EXCLUDES LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FROM HOUSING. THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT MINORITY COMMUNITIES. WE BELIEVE SB NINE CAN BE PART OF AN EFFORT TO EXPAND HELPING. YOU MAY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY. SB NINE DOES NOT PROHIBIT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES OR SONY IT SIMPLY PROVIDES WITHIN SUCH AREA PROPERTY OWNERS MUST ALSO BE ALLOWED TO CREATE SMALL MULTI FAMILY HOUSING OPTIONS. SB NINE CREATED BY RIGHT MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE CREATION OF TWO TO FOUR HOMES AND SINGLE FAMILY ABOUT. ALLOWS PARCEL MAPS TO CREATE A LOT FROM ONE INCREMENTAL TO TWO HOMES FOR A LOT. YOU OUGHT TO A TWO YEAR EACH BACK. A YOU ARE ALREADY ALLOWS UP TO THREE UNITS PER A LOT BUT THIS IS AN INCREMENTAL CHANGE BUT THE KEY IS TO PERFORM OUT PROVISION THAT ALLOWS NEW HOMES TO BE SOLD WHICH WILL HELP CREATE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES NOT AVAILABLE UNDER OTHER HOUSING PRODUCTION BILLS. AND ALTHOUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESSES MINISTERIAL THE MAJORITY OF OBJECTIVE PLANNING STANDARDS WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY TO NEW DEVELOPMENT BUT THERE'S A FEW ACTION TO EXPEDITE THE ADOPTION OF NEW IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS THIS APPROACH HELPS BALANCE STATE AND LOCAL INTERESTS SB NINE DEFINES MINIMUM PERFORMANCE TARGETS BUT IT LEAVES THE GROUND FOR LOCAL PLANNERS TO DEFINE AND APPLY CONTACT SPECIFIC STANDARDS. FINALLY AND OUR HOPE THAT INCREASING HOUSING CHOICE ANYTHING A FAMILY FILMS ON THE CALIFORNIA'S CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES MORE INCLUSIVE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT SHOULD NOT COME AT THE COST OF DESTABILISING EXISTING HOME AND THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT THE BILL SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF EXISTING HOUSING AND THE DISPLACEMENT AFFORDABLE TENANTS. APA CALIFORNIA SUPPORT ZONING REFORM TO END THE PRACTICE OF REQUIRING ONLY SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ON A MAJORITY OF RESIDENTIAL LAND WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB NINE AND RESPECTFULLY.

HIS BARBER OR. MAYOR PROJECT NEAR NOW CAN. YES I'M I'M ON THIS IS AMERICA CZECHO- GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRAND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS BLANK CHECK ON THE MAYOR PRO TEMPORE THE CITY OF DOWNEY AS WELL THE PROCESS THE PRESIDENT OF THE L. A. COUNTY DIVISION OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. REPRESENTING EIGHTY SIX CITIES IN THE COUNTY I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO SB NINE ON BEHALF OF CAL STATE HE'S IN THE L. A. COUNTY DIVISION SB NINE AS PRESENTLY DRAFTED WOULD REQUIRE CITIES TO MINISTER EARLY APPROVED WITHOUT CONDITIONS DISCRETION FOR PUBLIC INPUT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CONTAINING TWO RESIDENTIAL UNITS. ON AN INDIVIDUAL PARCEL IN SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS ADDITIONALLY THIS MEASURE WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MINISTER EARLY APPROVED ON URBAN LOT SPLITS THAT'S CREATING TWO INDEPENDENT LOT THAT MAY BE SOLD SEPARATELY CALATHES AND THE ALLEY DIVISION HAVE WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR SEVERAL MONTHS ON AMENDMENTS. THAT WOULD HAVE ADDRESSED OUR PRIMARY CONCERNS. I'M FOR. WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. HOWEVER WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS ARE AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES FACING CALIFORNIA'S CITIES AFFORDABLY PRICED HOMES OUT OF REACH FOR MANY PEOPLE AND HOUSING IS NOT BEING BUILT FAST ENOUGH TO MEET THE CURRENT OR PROJECTED NEEDS OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS STATE. WELL CITIES DO NOT BUILD HOMES WE LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION BY PLANNING AND ZONING NEW PROJECTS BASED ON EXTENSIVE PUBLIC INPUT AND ENGAGEMENT STATE HOUSING LAWS AND THE NEEDS OF THE PART OF THE BUILDING INDUSTRY. FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS CALYCES IN THE CITY OF DOWNEY HAVE PERSISTENTLY PURSUED SOLUTIONS TO THE HOUSING SUPPLY AND AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT IS GRIPPING MANY REGIONS OF THE STATE. THESE SOLUTIONS INCLUDE STREAMLINING THE HOUSING APPROVAL PROCESS CREATING A NEW STATE AND LOCAL FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. AND CONSOLIDATING IMPORTANT HOUSING PROGRAM GRANT APPLICATIONS. SOME OF THESE EFFORTS ARE FALLING SHORT AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ACTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR. IN DOWNEY WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TO OUR STATE MANDATED HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE WHICH INCREASES ARE PLANNED HOUSING PROJECTION FROM A THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN UNITS IN OUR CURRENT PLANS. 260-005-0020 FIVE IN OUR NEW. EIGHT YEAR PLAN COMMENCING JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THUS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED NEW HOUSING AND REZONING OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR CITY TO ABSORB DAY INCREASED DENSITY AND ADDITIONAL UNITS. WE FOCUS THESE EFFORTS ADJACENT TO A NEW METRO LIGHT RAIL STATION FACILITATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT AND ADJACENT TO EXISTING HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT AREAS WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR SHOPPING CENTERS WHICH COMBINED PROVIDE IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY ACRES. TO INCORPORATE NEW HOUSING WE'VE ALSO RECORDED STEADY INCREASE OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT DEVELOPMENT CITY WIDE WITH A FORECASTED AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY USED PRODUCED ANNUALLY. OUR CITY COUNCIL EMPHASIZED THEIR COMMITMENT TO INCREASING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUBCOMMITTEE ONE OF THEIR FIRST ACTIONS WAS TO INITIATE AN INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE STUDY. WITH THE GOAL OF CODIFYING THE ORDINANCE WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. CALATHES AN ALLEY DIVISION APPRECIATE APPRECIATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM ATKINS DESIRE TO PURSUE A HOUSING PRODUCTION PROPOSAL. UNFORTUNATELY SB NINE WILL NOT SPUR MUCH NEEDED HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IN A MANNER THAT SUPPORTS LOCAL FLEXIBILITY. DECISION MAKING AND COMMUNITY INPUT. STATE DRIVEN MINISTERIAL OR BY RIGHT THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE EXTENSIVE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPING AND ADOPTING W. ORDINANCES AND HOUSING ELEMENT SENATE CERTIFIED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. SB NINE WOULD IGNORE THIS LONG STANDING STATE MANDATED HOUSING PLANNING PROCESS AND INSTEAD FORCES CITIES TO APPROVE NEW HOUSING THAT MAY CONFLICT. WITH CERTIFIED HOUSING PLANS. THIRTY REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON SB NINE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S NOT GO TO THE NEXT MAIN OPPOSITION WHEN THIS. HI THERE MY NAME IS MADELEINE BARBER. GET AFTERNOON MISTER SHARON STATUS CAME ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I AM AN OPERATIONS SPECIALIST FOR HOUSING IS A HUMAN RIGHT. I AM ALSO AN ELECTED OFFICIAL OFFICIAL SERVING AS A MEMBER OF THE OPPORTUNITY COUNTY COUNCIL IN LAND USE COMMITTEE. TODAY I'M THINKING OF THE BLACK HOME ON MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER. TWO FIFTY JIM CROW DURING THE GREAT MIGRATION MANY BLACK FAMILIES CAME TO CALIFORNIA FOR BETTER JOBS AND BETTER LIVES. SB NINE IS A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING MUCH LIKE FDR'S NEW DEAL PRECLUDED REDLINING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS SH MANY BLACK FAMILIES THAT MAC MIGRATED FROM THE SOUTH OUR STORIES ARE THE SAME. WE UNDERSTOOD THAT ONE OF OUR ONLY OPTIONS TO BUILD GENERATIONAL WEALTH FOR FAMILIES WITH TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. OUR HOMES ARE SANCTUARY IN OFF THE PLACES WE KNOW WE CAN BE RETURN FEELS WHEN AND IF OUR PATH TO ECONOMIC STABILITY TAKES A DETOUR SH AND SOME INSTANCES KEEPING PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE THINGS WOULD BE ON HOW. SCHLEPPING OPENS THE DOOR WHY DEVELOPERS MANY AT HOME A REGULAR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTORS TO LOCAL AND STATE POLITICIANS. THEY TAKE NO CONSIDERATION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN THESE COMMUNITIES OR GENERATIONAL DISPLACEMENT OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF GOOD PAL THING. THE HOUSING THEY SEEK TO BUILD IS NOT AFFORDABLE IT IS LUXURY. THE HOUSING THEY SEEK TO BUILD IS NOT AFFORDABLE IT IS LUXURY. THE AGENDA IS TO PRICE OUT THE MIDDLE WORKING CLASS RESIDENTS DIGIT THREE GENTRIFICATION AND IT'S QUITE CREATE LIFELONG RENTERS WILL HAVE LITTLE TO NO ECONOMIC STABILITY. SH MY OWN HOUSEHOLD INCLUDES THREE GENERATION HONESTLY IT WOULD BE FOR IF WE HAD ONE FROM ANOTHER SH BECAUSE I REFUSE TO ALLOW MY SON TO START HIS OWN FAMILY BY PAYING AT THE VERY LEAST THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THE MORTGAGE RATE. WE NEED MORE BLACK HOMEOWNERS NOT MORE RANCHERS. WE NEED MORE FIRST TIME BUYER PROGRAMS FOR MIDDLE AND WORKING CLASS FAMILIES TO HELP WITH THAT INCLUDES THE DOWN PAYMENT. WE ALSO NEED INCREASED FAIR HOUSING INTERNET LEGISLATION TO FEND OFF PREDATORY AND FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR. I WISH I HAD TIME TO TELL YOU MY STORY THE WHAT OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH TO KEEP OUR HOME OF OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. BECAUSE BUYING OUR HOME TURNED OUT TO BE NOT THE HARDEST PART SH AND ONE CASE RESULTED IN A COURT CASE. BARBERS LEVINE UNDERSTATEMENT MEREKA SHE IN ANOTHER CASE. ADAM SCHIFF OFTEN INTERVENE ON OUR BEHALF WITH THE CORRUPT LENDER. LASTLY UNINTENDED BY POLITICIANS LUDICROUS TRICKLE DOWN LIFE. PLEASE STOP INSULTING OUR INTELLIGENCE WITH MATH UNICORNS SHELL GAMES INCLUSION.

IT'S PRETTY FRUSTRATING TO ME THAT WE ARE HERE RE LITIGATING. A VERY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THAT DERELICTION AND DYSFUNCTION OF THIS LEGISLATURE. YOU CALLS FROM. LEGISLATORS IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND I DO APPRECIATE THE OUTREACH- BUT I'LL SAY ON A WHEN IT COMES THAT LATE IN THE GAME ON A MAJOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT DOESN'T REALLY SUGGEST TO ME A GENUINE DESIRE. TO COLLABORATE ON POLICY AS A POINT OF CONTRAST THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO REACHED OUT TO ME WELL OVER A WEEK BEFORE THIS HEARING WE'VE HAD LENGTHY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HIS BILL AND I WAS ABLE TO GIVE HIM A GOOD SENSE. OF WHERE I STAND ON EACH OF HIS THREE BILLS ACTUALLY- PRIOR TO THIS HEARING. TURNING TO THE YOU KNOW THE MERITS OF THE LEGISLATION. I HAVE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE IN. OVER THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS I SUPPORTED. EVERY BILL THAT I COULD THAT THAT I'VE SEEN- THAT. I BELIEVE IT WOULD CREATE AN ADVANTAGE EXPAND OUR HOUSING SUPPLY IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THAT'S EVEN BEEN INTENTION WAS SOME OF THE OTHER VALUES THAT GUIDE BY POLICY MAKING BUT I THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS THAT IMPORTANT IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUALITY OF LIFE HERE WHEN IT COMES. TO OUR STATE'S FUTURE AND YET WE HAVE SEEN NO IMPROVEMENT THE PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN WORSE THE LAST TWO YEARS THE NUMBER OF PERMITS HAS DECLINED BURKE WE'RE BUILDING A VERY VERY SMALL FRACTION OF WHAT WE ULTIMATELY NEED. AND IF THERE WERE REAL POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN THIS STATE AND WE WOULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IN A WAY THAT IS URGENT IN A WAY THAT IS COMPREHENSIVE WE HAVE A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DEAL WITH STEEP WHAT TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT COST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS- TO BUILD IN GOVERNMENT CREATED COST BEFORE. YOU EVEN BREAK GROUND AND MANY OTHER COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS THAT REASONABLE PEOPLE CONCERNS JUST WITH IMPLEMENTING GOOD POLICY WOULD BE ABLE TO AGREE ON. BUT WE'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT INSTEAD OF THE ONE LEVER THAT WE'VE BEEN WILLING TO TRY TO PULL IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES WHICH IS TO ADDRESS- THE ZONING RELAX SOME OF THE RESTRICTIVE NIS- OF ZONING AND YOU KNOW YOU YOU GOT ASKED WHY IS THAT WHY IS THIS THE ONE THING. THAT WERE REALLY WILLING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT MY READ ON THE SITUATION IS YOU HAVE IN FAVOR OF A BILL LIKE THIS SOME VERY POWERFUL INTERESTS THAT HAVE. A LOT OF PULL ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE FRANKLY- AND ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THAT'S ENOUGH THERE'S ENOUGH OLITICAL MUSCLE TO OVERCOME THIS STRONG OPPOSITION AND QUITE LEGITIMATE OPPOSITION IN SOME CASES- OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT- AND SO BECAUSE IT'S SACRAMENTO. INTEREST ON ONE SIDE AND JUST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON THE OTHER THAT'S ABOUT A WERE WILLING TO FIGHT TO SOME EXTENT BUT IN ORDER SHOULD PRESS ANY OF THE PARTS OF THE HOUSING PROBLEM. SUDDENLY THEN YOU HAVE SACRAMENTO SPECIAL INTERESTS ON BOTH SIDES AND YOU'RE EVEN MORE POWERFUL SPECIAL INTEREST. ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE AND SO WE'RE NOT WILLING TO FIGHT THOSE BATTLES. AND SO I'VE SUPPORTED MEASURES LIKE THIS BUT I'VE ALSO STARTED TO ASK MYSELF. AM I YOU KNOW- ENABLING A STRATEGY OF AVOIDANCE WHERE WE LOOK LIKE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING TO ADDRESS HOUSING HOUSING BUT ACTUALLY AVOIDING THE MUCH BIGGER ISSUES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR US HAVING. BY FAR THE WORST HOUSING SITUATION- IN THE COUNTRY. SO THAT'S WHY I FEEL VERY CONFLICTED ABOUT MY VOTE TODAY- BUT I AM GOING TO VOTE YES I'M GONNA SEE I WANT TO SEE. HOW THIS WORKS I THINK IT'LL HELP I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE GREAT DEAL. BUT I'LL ALSO SAY I THAT I'M GONNA BE VERY RELUCTANT TO FULL THE PULL THIS PARTICULAR LOVER AGAIN. INTEL WERE WILLING TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND A MUCH MORE. COMPREHENSIVE WAY THANK YOU. PLEASE OKAY LET'S GO OTHERS MIX WORKS ACTIONS ARE MISSED WHICH HAD HER HAND UP FOR SENT TO MISS WORK SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BACK AGAIN THIS YEAR AND THANK SENATOR REQUIRE FOR COMING PRESENTING TODAY. I HAVE A QUESTION AND SOME COMMENTS- YOU KNOW IT WAS RAISED BY A SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THAT WAS CALLING IN THE CONCERNED ABOUT A FIRE SAFETY WITH REGARD TO. THIS BILL I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU COULD CLARIFY. SENATOR MCGUIRE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- FIRST S. B. I. S. B. NINE SORRY GOES FURTHER THAN AND THEN EXISTING EIGHTY LAW IN TERMS OF FIRE SAFETY. SO FURTHER I THINK MAKING IT SAFER. TO IT- SB NINE COPIES EXISTING LAWS FOR BY RIGHT HOUSING VIS A VIS SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH SAYS THAT VERY HIGH FIRE SAFETY SEVERITY ZONES ARE EXEMPT FROM THE BILL. EXCEPT WHERE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALREADY ALLOWS FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE ZONE AND THE DEVELOPMENT MEETS THE STATE STANDARDS FOR FIRE MITIGATION WHICH INCLUDES I THINK OF THREE THINGS ONE. BUILDING STANDARDS TO REDUCE COMBUSTIBLE THE AN EMBER INTRUSION INTO HOMES SECONDLY THE BORDER FOR STATE REGULATIONS FOR ROAD STANDARDS WATER SUPPLY FOR FIRE. FIGHTING SIGNAGE AND FUEL BREAKS AND THIRDLY DEFENSIBLE SPACE REGULATIONS AND THEN THE THIRD THING I BELIEVE AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE PRESENTING THIS BILL IS. MY UNDERSTANDING THE STANDARDS WOULD BE STRENGTHENED UNDER S. B. TWELVE CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THAT THIS ISSUE A LITTLE BIT. YES MA'AM THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- GRATEFUL FOR THE QUESTION. SO ONE OF THE POSITIVE ASPECTS ABOUT THIS BILLS LOCAL CONTROL. TO RIGHT NOW IF A CITY OR COUNTY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO BAN DEVELOPMENT IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES IT COULD DO THAT. AND WHAT. THE PROGRAM'S BEEN VERY FOCUSINGON IS PRESERVING LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL CONTROL IN REGARDS TO WHERE LOCALS. CAN BUILD HERE- BASED OFF OF AFFORDABILITY SO FOR EXAMPLE- AFFORDABLE COVENANTS COULD BE PLACED UNDER THIS BILL AS WELL. ALONG WITH THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. SPECIFICALLY ON THE HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES SO WE DO NOT SPECIFICALLY IS EXEMPT THAT BECAUSE LOCALS CAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW EVEN AS WE SPEAK. WHAT WE WOULD. HOPE IS THAT. NOT JUST FOCUSING ON FOR. BUT LOOKING AT MANSIONS AS WELL RIGHT IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. IN SO BRING INTO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT SB TWELVE. RIGHT NOW- WHAT WE KNOW WITH THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF FIRES IN THE STATE. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BUILDING MATERIAL ANYMORE. IT'S ABOUT WHERE WE BUILD. IT'S A REALLY TOUGH CONVERSATION. AND IT'S WE'VE HEARD FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEADERS IN THE STATE CALLERS CALLING IN TODAY HOUSING IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE. IN ANYTHING DIFFICULT IS WORTH MOVING ON. SO WHILE WE'RE ADVANCING A COMPREHENSIVE IN ITS LED BY THE PRO TEM. ADVANCING A COMPREHENSIVE HOUSING PACKAGE THE HOUSING BOND FOCUSING ON FOUR OTHER BILLS PLUS SB NINE WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT SENATE BILL TWELVE SO THE MORE YOU BUILD IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY AREAS. THE MORE REGULATIONS AND SAFEGUARDS ARE PUT ONTO IT YOU CAN NO LONGER HAVE JUST ONE WAY AND ONE WAY OUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IN INGRESS AND EGRESS YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON. MANDATED DEFENSIBLE SPACE IT'S- YOU CAN'T BUILD AT THE VERY. PEAK OF THE SLOPE YOU HAVE TO TAKE IN MORE FIRE SAFE ZONE TO BE OF THE BUILDING. THAT BILLS ALSO CONTROVERSIAL- BUT- SO THIS IS THIS BILL IS PART OF A LARGER SWEET OF BILLS. SENATE BILL TWELVE IS A COMPLIMENT TO THE HOUSING PACKAGE. AND THE LAST PIECE IT'LL SAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I DON'T MEAN TO GO ON THE BOARD OF FORESTRY RIGHT NOW EVEN AS WE TALKED IS CURRENTLY UPDATING THEIR STANDARDS. UP IN THEIR STANDARDS ABOUT WHERE FOLKS CAN BUILD IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES- INTO THAT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY HAPPENING IN ADDITION TO THE LEGISLATURE MOVING- ON SENATE BILL TWELVE. FINALLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- THE SIM THE RINGS UP A GOOD POINT BECAUSE MANY OF OUR- DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN RAVAGED BY FIRES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT THE PREVIOUS ATTORNEY GENERAL AND NOW THIS CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL- THERE ARE. THREE DIFFERENT AREAS OF LITIGATION WHERE THE PER OF JESS HERE IN THIS OR FOR. ON ONE IN SANDY. AND ANOTHER IN LAKE. BASED OFF OF THE I. R. THAT- ARE NOT- ATTICA. WHEN IT COMES TO SAY STAND. SO THE JOURNALS OFFER IS NOW. THOSE TO THE- TO FOR- ENHANCE STANDARD FOR SAFETY IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES THERE'S ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS. A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE- THAT. THAT OFFICE IS ALSO FOCUSING IN ON SO THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE STATE- AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. WE HAVE TO BUILD HOUSING. IT TOOK EVERYTHING THAT I HAD. PLUS MY WIFE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE COMMUNITY THAT I GREW UP IN MY FAMILY'S BEEN IN FOR THREE GENERATIONS ON THE FOURTH. AND WE HAVE TO FOCUS EVEN THOUGH HOUSING BILLS ARE HARD WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON MOVING FORWARD AND I'M SORRY. AT MENACINGLY BY ONE ON FOR SO LONG BUT- HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERED THE QUESTION IN REGARDS TO TWELVE AND ARCHITECT. I APPRECIATE THAT A SENATOR REQUIRE- YOU THE OTHER ISSUE I JUST WANTED TO ALSO COMMENT ON AS IT WAS RAISED BY OPPOSITION A COUPLE TIMES AT THIS BILL HAS NO. AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS TO IT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE CURRENT STATUS QUO OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING HAS NO AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS TO IT. AND A SINGLE FAMILY ZONING IS ROOTED IN REDLINING AND IT IS CREATED HUGE PROBLEMS AND- YOU KNOW IT RESULTS IN. A EXCLUSIONARY HOUSING AND AT LEAST THIS BILL THESE UNITS CAN BE A DEED RESTRICTED SHOULD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DECIDE WHICH I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD I THINK THIS BILL WILL CREATE MORE. HOUSING WHICH WE OBVIOUSLY NEED IT NEEDS YOU SAID- INCREASE DENSITY IN A WAY THAT I THINK DOESN'T FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH I KNOW WAS IMPORTANT FOR SOME PEOPLE. IT GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE ABILITY AS YOU SAID TO PREVENT BUILDING AND HIGH FIRE SOUNDS WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR PARTS OF MY DISTRICT BERKELEY OAKLAND AREA WE HAD A FIRE THEIR NINETEEN NINETY TWO- THIS BILL IS OPTIONAL IT ALLOWS. HOMEOWNERS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUILD SMALLER UNIT SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO- AND I THINK IT SUCKS AND I WAS A BIG SUPPORTER OF SB ELEVEN TWENTY AT THE END OF SESSION LAST YEAR I SPOKE ON THE BILL IN THE WEE HOURS OF THE DAY. I REMAIN COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL I THINK WE NEED TO LEGALIZE DUPLEXES WE NEED TO CREATE MORE HOUSING WE NEED TO BE A MORE INCLUSIVE STATE. AND HAVE OUR HOUSING POLICIES MATCH OUR PROGRESSIVE VALUES BY ENSURING THAT WE REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESS THE HOUSING SHORTAGE I'M HAPPY. TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH. THERE'S BEEN A MOTION WITH THE BILL'S SECOND. THIS MAN A SECOND AND NOW LET'S GO TO MISS CORK SILVA. THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL I KNOW ITS- A- DIFFICULT CONVERSATION AND- I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND IF YOU COULD I KNOW IT WAS JUST ADDRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUES HERE. BUT DOES THIS BILL- DO ANYTHING REGARDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. DOES THAT ADDRESS IT BECAUSE I WILL BE HONEST I'VE IN MY DISTRICT RECEIVED MAILERS- SENT OUT SAYING THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THANK YOU SO MUCH- SOME NUMBER AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL THAT YOU BROUGHT THAT UP. SO PUTTING A HEADLINE ON THE MAILER IS ONE ISSUE. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR DECISION BASED OFF OF DATA SO LET'S TALK ABOUT DATA TODAY. SO ACCORDING TO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS. 65% OF ALL EIGHTY USE THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT IN THE COUNTY OF LA- PROVIDE AFFORDABLE RANGE. FOR FAMILIES THAT WOULD FALL INTO THE LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING CATEGORY. SO YOU HAVE VERY LOW LOW AND MODERATE- 65% OF ALL EIGHTY USE WOULD FALL INTO THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING CATEGORY 68% OF ALL EIGHTY USE IN ORANGE COUNTY AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILY THAT FALLS INTO THAT LOW INCOME CREDIT CATEGORY CAN AFFORD THE AVERAGE RATE OF EIGHTY YOU. THE REASON WHY I BRING THAT UP BUT THESE DUPLEXES ARE VERY SIMILAR SIZES TO EIGHTY USE. SO THE SECOND PIECE IS WE ENCOURAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PUT DEED RESTRICTIONS UNDER THESE DUPLEXES. AGAIN WHAT WE REALLY TRY TO FOCUS IN ON IS AN ELEGANT APPROACH THE LOCAL CONTROL. SO IF AND IF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WANTED TO BE ABLE TO PUT DEED RESTRICTIONS. COVENANTS ON TO EACH OF THESE DUPLEXES THEY COULD. THEY DON'T NEED THE STATE SIMPLY TO TELL THEM. CANDIDLY I WE HEARD ONE OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS TRUMP WITH THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO BUILD A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHTY USE. THEIR MINISTERIAL. JUST LIKE THIS BILL. SO THAT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL GOING TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE'RE LITERALLY SEEING THOUSANDS OF EIGHTY USE IN PERMIT. BEING BUILT OR BUILT THAT NOW ARE AFFORDABLE BASED OFF OF WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC AFFORDABILITY COVENANTS IN THE BILL BUT THAT DOES NOT STOP- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM DOING THAT OTHERWISE THANK YOU SOME NUMBER HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. YES AND THEN I HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP COMMENTS GUESTS PLEASE AND AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND WE KIND OF SPEAK HOUSING LANGUAGE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A DO YOU MEAN YES AN EIGHTY YOU MEANS A AS AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT ALL ARE. AN OLDER TERM WOULD BE A GRANNY FLAT OR EVEN A MOTHER IN LAW CAN WE KNOW THAT. IN THE PAST SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PAST THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE OF HOUSING IN THE PAST- THERE WERE OFTEN EIGHTY USER GRANNY FLATS BUILT EXACTLY FOR WHAT IT SAYS EITHER AGING PARENTS- MOTHER LOVE WHICH IS A LITTLE. NEGATIVE BUT THOSE WERE BUILT AND THEN THEY STOPPED. AND THEY STOPPED BECAUSE THERE WERE MANY REASONS- BARRIERS FOR SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE WHETHER THEY'D THEY WERE A FEES FROM THE CITY'S. OF OTHER REASONS BUT EIGHTY USE ARE NOW BECOMING. ARE COMING BACKIF YOU WANT TO SAY OLD SCHOOL NEW SCHOOL. AND THERE IS NO MANDATE FOR A SINGLE FAMILY A HOMEOWNER TO CHOOSE TO DO THAT MATTER FACT UP THERE ARE AND STILL SOME BARRIERS AS FAR AS COST BUT THIS BILL- IT TALKS ABOUT. WHAT HAVE WE DONE IN THE PAST AND NOW WHAT ARE WE DOING IN THE FUTURE AND RIGHT NOW IN THE PRESENT WE SEE WE HAVE A PRODUCTION OF. CRISIS A PRODUCTION CRISIS THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO SAY LET'S LOOK AT UP WHERE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE CURRENTLY AND CAN WE LOOK TOWARDS. THE FUTURE AS FAR AS PROVIDING OTHER FORMS OF HOUSING WITHIN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. I COME FROM ORANGE COUNTY TO SACRAMENTO I WALKED THROUGH SACRAMENTO AND I AM AMAZED AT SOME OF THE BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBORHOODS. HERE THAT THAT IN MANY TIMES WE'LL SEE A SINGLE FAMILY BUT THEN EIGHT DUPLEX MAYBE FOUR UNITS MAYBE EIGHT UNITS AND THEN SOMETIMES EVEN A- OF MORE A TALLER BUILDING THAT MIGHT HAVE THAT UP EVEN MORE RESIDENTS. THEY SEEM TO CO EIST UP VERY NICELY AND THESE HAVE BEEN BUILT NOT JUST IN THE LAST DECADE BUT MANY DECADES AGO SO I THINK THAT IF PEOPLE REALLY DRIVE THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND- LOOK TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST. AND HOW WE CAN TAKE SOME CUES FROM THAT BUT THIS IS NOT THE BILL. THAT IS AS- AS PEOPLE ARE MAKING IT OUT BUT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TWO OR THREE THINGS. BECAUSE I HAVE RECEIVED CALLS AND OPPOSITION FROM SOME PEOPLE MY- AND MY AREA AND I KNOW THEY'RE VERY PROTECTIVE OF- THE COMMUNITIES. NOT IN THE SENSE OF OVER BUILDING BUT IN THE CHARACTER FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT SO IT SAYS THE STATE OR LOCAL HISTORICAL DISTRICT. OR PROPERTY AS DEFINED MEANING THIS BILL WOULD NOT APPLY TO THAT- THIS HOW THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WILL NOT REQUIRE DEMOLITION OR ALTERATION OF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF HOUSE. HOUSING AND THEN IT LISTS BUT THIS BILL IS ELEVEN PAGES LONG THAT WE HAVE HERE SO I REALLY PLEAD WITH THE PEOPLE WHO'VE CALLED TO READ IT CAREFULLY BECAUSE THE MAILERS THAT YOU RECEIVE. JUST TALK ABOUT GENTRIFICATION- AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY OF A VERY LIMITING AS FAR AS THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THOSE MAILERS OUT BECAUSE THIS SIMPLY SAYS. UP LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE STOCK OF HOUSING WE HAVE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD LET'S GIVE SOME ZONING OPTIONS NONE OF THEM ARE MANDATES- AND LET'S MOVE FORWARD WITH BUILDING IN CALIFORNIA SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR. BEING THE- INTERMEDIARY OR AS FAR AS PRESENT IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR L. COURTS IN NUMBER. THANK YOU TO OUR VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU AND- THANK YOU SENATOR FOR OUR CONVERSATIONS THE PREVIOUS REGARDING THIS BILL AND SOME OF THE OTHERS. SO MY CONCERNS ARE THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT I HAD THAT OTHERS EXPRESS I'M NOT GONNA REITERATE DOES IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. BUT YOU KNOW COMING FROM AN AREA- IN IN MY DISTRICT. IS AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE ARE FLEEING TO- JUST LIKE UP HERE IN THE BAY AREA IF YOU ARE FOR THE BAY AREA FOLKS ARE FLEEING TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF SACRAMENTO. AND YOU GO OUT AND YOU LOOK AT. DID THE ROSE BILLS LINCOLN'S EL DORADO HILLS FOLSOM'S. AND WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE THEY'RE BUILDING A LOT OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THEY'RE ALSO BUILDING A LOT OF MULTI FAMILY HOMES. THESE ARE ALL COMMUNITIES THAT WERE BUILT ON MASTER PLANS. THEIR MASTER PLANNED COMMUNITIES THAT WENT THROUGH A PROCESS THAT WENT THROUGH THE STATE'S PROCESS. TO EVEN BE ABLE TO BUILD WHAT THEY HAVE TO GET THEIR GENERAL PLANS APPROVED. AND WHAT THIS ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS TO HAPPEN IS A DOUBLING OF THE POPULATION VIA EVERY RESIDENTIAL BEING ELIGIBLE TAB TWO INSTEAD OF ONE. AND WITHOUT A SEQUEL IT WITHOUT THE STATE'S OWN SEQUEL PROCESS. IT WOULD PUT IT OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE SEQUEL PROCESS DEVELOPED BY THE STATE. AND ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE MOVE OUT THERE IS BECAUSE IT IS MORE PLAN. IS BECAUSE THE AREAS THEY MOVED FROM AND I CAN I'VE WORKED IN THOSE AREAS YOU CAN'T EVEN DRIVE DOWN THE STREET WHERE YOU HAVE THESE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND THEN ANOTHER ONE OR THEY DECIDE TO BUILD TWO HOUSES ON ONE LOT. AND THERE'S NO INCREASE I MEAN THERE'S NO ACCOMMODATIONS FOR INCREASED VEHICLES AND END UP VEICLE MILES TRAVELED OR WHATEVER DID FORMULA IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO USE. AND THE OTHER PART IS ESPECIALLY ON AREAS LIKE OURS. THERE ARE NO JOBS FOR PEOPLE OUT THERE. SO IF THEY COME OUT THERE ARE TENTATIVE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. AND THAT'S YET ANOTHER ISSUE THIS IS NOT BY ANY STRETCH OF IMAGINATION- GUARANTEE AFFORDABILITY. BUT IF THEY'RE ABLE TO AFFORD. SOMETHING OUT THERE MORE THAN THEY ARE- IT TOWARDS. THEY MOVED THERE AND THEY JOIN THE CAN CROWD. AND INSTEAD OF FOR OUR COMMUTE TURNS IN FIVE SIX HOUR COMMUTE VERY EVERY. DAY AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT WITHIN. OF OUR C. THE ALLOW THEIR STEVEN THIS PLAN OR THE PLAN. APPROVED IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS. WHERE THEY'VE TAKEN A LOT AND SAYING HEY YOU KNOW WHAT THIS USED TO BE A SINGLE FAMILY LOT BUT- WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW TWO OR THREE UNITS TO BE BUILT ON THAT- INSTEAD OF. TWO OR THREE UNITS I MEAN IT'S NOT A ONE UNIT THE COST. THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. THEY HAVE THREE UNITS THAT COST TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS EACH. GO TO PALO ALTO I CAN GIVE YOU AN ADDRESS AND YOU CAN GO LOOK AT IT. IT DID NOT CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT JUST CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY TO MAKE THREE TIMES AS MUCH ON THE MARKET VALUE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO. I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN SAY THIS IS GOING TO SOMEHOW MAKE A BIG SPLASH. IN THE AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE INFILL HOUSING IN AREAS THAT WE HAD ABSOLUTELY ZERO PLANS TO DO SO. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HEAR A LOT OF FRUSTRATION FROM PEOPLE AS THEY DON'T WANT THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS RUINS LIKE THAT. THEY MOVED OUT THERE IN THE PLANNED AREAS SO THEY KNEW WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. AND THEY DON'T WANT THAT RUINED. I DON'T BLAME THEM. THEY SHOULDN'T. SORRY DID YOU KNOW THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE ISSUES. THAT COME WITH RETROACTIVELY COMING IN. AND THEN ADDING POPULATION IN THE AREAS. THAT WE WERE TOLD WE COULDN'T. IF WE IF WE BROUGHT THAT IS A PLAN TO THE- HOUSING- FOLKS. THEY WOULD THEY WOULDN'T TURN IT DOWN. THEY WOULD HAVE TOLD US NEVER VOTE REDO THIS. SO WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT THE ISSUE WITH HOUSING IS NOT. THAT. WE'RE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH INFILL HOUSING ISSUE WITH HOUSING IS THAT WE HAVE CREATED SUCH A REGULATORY MONSTROSITY. TO BUILD A HOUSE A SIMPLE HOUSE. THAT IS NOT AFFORDABLE WE'VE AFFECTED HOW MUCH MATERIALS COST IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE AFFECTED HOW MUCH LABOR COSTS IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE AFFECTED EVERY ASPECT OF BUILDING A HOME. AND THEN WE HAVE THIS ENORMOUS COST AT THE END. AND THEN WE SAY WELL IT'S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FAULT BECAUSE WE GIVE THEM A BAG OF REGULATORY ITEMS THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE EVERY DEVELOPER GO THROUGH. TO BE ABLE TO EVEN SAY HERE CITY COUNCIL DO APPROVE THIS CITY COUNCILLORS ARE NOT NOT APPROVING PROJECTS. CITY COUNCILS ARE APPROVING PROJECT IT'S JUST A FIVE TO TEN YEAR PROCESS IT TAKES EVERY DEVELOPMENT TO GET THROUGH THAT. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO CHECK OFF EVERY SINGLE BOX OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE HAS CREATED. FOR THEM TO COME TO BUILD A HOUSE. SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS. BY GOING INTO EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS RETROACTIVELY ALLOWING THIS DOUBLING OF THE POPULATION. AND THEN SAYING HEY YOU KNOW NO BIG DEAL ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT BAYERN MENTAL QUALITY. THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AND THEN ALL WILL HAVE IS OVER DENSIFY NEIGHBOURHOODS. WITH PEOPLE THAT NEED TO COSTS CONTINUE TO COMMUTE IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE DRAWING IN A BUNCH OF JOBS INTO THE INLAND EMPIRE AREAS. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE COMING AND NOBODY WANTS TO COME HERE. SO I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS BY DOING INFILL DEVELOPMENT THAT INCREASES DENSITY NEIGHBORHOODS INCREASES ALL OF THE IMPACT. AND TAKES IT BEYOND WHAT EVEN ARE APPROVAL WAS GIVEN TO US FOR. SO EVEN THAT'S THAT'S JUST A TIP OF THE ICEBERG SURE ASSEMBLY ISSUES THAT I HAVE WITH THIS APPROACH. IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK IF I WERE GOING TO WORK I'D BE ALL OVER. BUT IT WON'T I'VE SEEN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THIS HAPPENS IN. AND IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. AND I KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF. TO THE JOINT IT WITH A VERY MATURE YEAH- IN INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU FOR TAKING YOUR TIME IN YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION- PRIOR TO HEARING IN JUST WANNA SAY. I MEAN THIS IS A SAID TO YOU FEEL REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND JUST WANT TO SAY HELP WE SHOULD OF I AM- NUMBER ONE WE LOOK AT WHERE OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS ACCORDING HOUSING CAN BE DEVELOPMENT IT IS GOING TO BE THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE RENTALS WE NEED TO DO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AFFORDABLE RENTALS ACROSS THE STATE BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. I'M IN ITS REALLY FOCUS ON WORKFORCE HOUSING. AND AT. ONE I HEAR YOU IN REGARDS TO SEQUEL- IN ONE OF THE BARRIERS I CERTAINLY GET THE ONLY BARRIER IT'S ALSO HIGH PERMIT FEES IN CONNECTION FEES AS WELL RIGHT BUT RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE TO BUILD A DUPLEX WEATHER'S MARIANNA OR IF IT'S IN HEALDSBURG WHERE I LIVE YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ON A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN TOWN YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH SEQUEL YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND NAY DECK AND IF YOU'RE TO BUILD A DUPLEX RIGHT NOW I NEED YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. SO I DO THINK ON THE SECRET PEACE I THINK IT MAKES SENSE AND NOT APPLYING THAT TO THIS ISSUE- WHERE WE REALLY ARE. NEEDING TO FOCUS. IN THIS IS ALL STATE DATA. IS AN ISSUE OF WORKFORCE HOUSING. BECAUSE IF WE CAN BUILD WHERE PEOPLE WORK ESPECIALLY ON THE SERVICE RELATED JOBS. AND WORKFORCE HOUSING WE ARE GOING TO SEE A REDUCTION VEEAM TEAS. IN THE LAST PIECE OF SAY IS THIS. IN A MONEY ITEMS THAT- WANT TO SAY THANK YOU THE VICE CHAIR FOR SERVICES. TO THE FIRE SERVICES WELL INTO THE CITY COUNCIL- I LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. MY HOUSE IS NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SQUARE FEET. MY PURCELL IS A QUARTER ACRE. I'VE ONLY BURKE PURCHASED OUR HOME- ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO. WE'RE THE ONLY ONE PRETTY MUCH ON THE BLOCK THAT DOESN'T HAVE AN EIGHTY YOU. OR EIGHTY YOU ENERGY DO YOU. IN THE VICE CHAIRS RIGHT WE DO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL CARS AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE KIDS ON THE BLOCK- BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD TO BE ABLE TO LIVE THERE ARE ANY HAS NOT CHANGED THE FACE OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT WE- KIND OF STUCK IN REGARDS TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH HOUSING ANY BILL THAT WE BRING FORWARD IS GONNA BE DIFFICULT WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING I THINK THAT THIS TAKES A NEIGHBORHOOD DRIVEN LEVEL I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY NOT SEE EYE TO EYE ON THIS AND AGAIN I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION HERE TODAY. AND LAST NIGHT BUT THE LONGER WE WAIT THE MORE DIFFICULT IS GOING TO BE IN CANDIDLY OR THE MIGRATION IS OUT OF THE STATE PART HIGHER WITH INDIVIDUALS IT'S FOLKS THAT CAN'T AFFORD RENT. SO THAT THEY AND I THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY A FOCUS BUT AGAIN MISTER VICE CHAIR I'M SO APPRECIATIVE. OF THAT THE DIALOGUE. DIRECTLY PLEASE SIR SO. IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE WE HAVE THE ECONOMIC CYCLE YES SIR INDISPENSABLE URINARY. HARDER THAN NORMAL. WHEN WE ARE DOWN CYCLE. BEFORE THE FINALS FOR. EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS DOLLARS REALLY WORKING FIFTY. AND THEN THE DOWNSIDE OF A JOB DOWN THERE HAVE A LINE FOR- ALLOW THE EIGHTY SPECULATOR COMMENT PURCHASE THE HOUSES THERE. YEAH BILL TO SMALL HOUSES AND KIND OF JUST UNDER THIS LAW WITHOUT ANY. ANY MINISTER ARE. YEAH ON HERE FIRST AND FOREMOST- ONLY SEVENTEEN PER. OF IN IN THE STATE ACTUALLY CORPORATE OWNED SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF UNITS IN THE STATE ARE OWNED BY HI SINGLE FAMILY- OWNED BY FAMILIES. OR HAVE A FAMILY HAS A FEW RENTAL SO I THINK ON THE CORPORATE SIDE I DON'T THINK THAT'S GIVING ISSUE WHEN IT COMES THE I. EIGHTY USE ONLY 8% EIGHTY USE ARE CORPORATE OWNED. SO THERE'S BEEN SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW LARGE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS ARE GONNA COME IN AND SWEEP THESE UP THE NUMBERS. DON'T SHOW THAT I AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO SHOW IN THE FUTURE NOW ON IT IN A DOWNTURN- EVEN WITH WHAT WE SAW IN THE PREVIOUS DOWNTURN BACK IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR EXAMPLE WERE STOCKTON AND MANTECA HIT SO HARD. THERE WAS- SOME CORPORATE OWNERSHIP BUT EVEN AFTER ALL OF THAT IT'S STILL 17% OF TOTAL HOUSING STOCK IN THE STATE ARE CORPORATE OWNED SO I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING. RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THAT- THE LAST DOWNTURN WE HAD WE HAD SO MANY FORECLOSURES ISN'T THOSE OF ALL BEEN TURNED INTO A LOT OF RENTAL UNITS YES SIR THERE ARE NONE NONE OF THEM ARE AFFORDABLE ANYMORE. SOME I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FASTER. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE ROBUST DISCUSSIONS- I'M GOING TO PROVIDE A COUPLE OF MY OWN COMMENTS AND LET ME JUST START BY THANKING. SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM FOR CHAMPION THIS BUILD NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT LAST YEAR REINTRODUCE NET. COURSE WANNA THANK SIR MCGUIRE FOR YOUR DOG ED ADVOCACY AND FOR PRESENTING THE BILL ANSWERING QUESTIONS TODAY. LET ME JUST START WITH WITH THE OBVIOUS COLLEAGUES WHICH IS THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE WE ARE HERE. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF TE WORST. HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND STATE'S HISTORY YOU KNOW THE STATISTICS OF HOW MANY MILLIONS OF UNITS WERE LACKING YOU KNOW. HOW SKYROCKETING OR HOME PRICES ARE ARE RENTS ARE- THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE- LARGEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WHO DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO CALL HOME. AND HOW WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD SOLUTIONS IN THIS SPACE. I DO WANT TO IT TO RESPOND TO OUR VICE CHAIRS PERSPECTIVE OF WHETHER THIS WILL WORK I WANT TO PROVIDE. EXPERTS SAID I HAD WHICH IS- THIRTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE WERE STARTING TO SEE THE BEGINNING OF THE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR CITY MY CITY WAS GROUND ZERO FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. AND THE FIRST BILL THAT I WROTE- WOULD HAVE LEGALIZED IN LAW UNITS AND SAN FRANCISCO EIGHTY YEARS. THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM IN OUR CITY AND AT THE TIME IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS CRAZY. THAT IF WE WERE TO CONSIDER DOING THAT WOULD CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF OUR CITY- THAT IT WENT. UP CREATE UNITS OR NOT AFFORDABLE- AND- AND LITERALLY DESTRUCTION UNITIES. I DID MOVE IT THAT YEAR. IT TOOK A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE I AUTHORED ONE OF THE VERY EARLIEST LOCALIZED. TO ALLOW THE CREATION OF EIGHTY USE. AND SINCE THAT TIME I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY WE'VE ALL SEEN THE POSITIVE IMPACT. OF EIGHTY LAW ON OUR STATES WE'VE SEEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNITS. TUCKED AWAY IN GARAGES AND BACKYARDS WERE MOSTLY AFFORDABLE TO FOLKS. OF AVERAGE TO BELOW AVERAGE INCOMES. AND IT'S MY PERSPECTIVE THAT THIS BILL WILL BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF THAT. AND WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE SIMILARLY BENEFICIAL IMPACTS. PARTICULARLY AND ESPECIALLY. FOR LOWER INCOME PROPERTY OWNERS WHO THROUGH. LOT SPLIT PROVISIONS WILL BE ABLE TO REALIZE THE VALUE OF THEIR PROPERTY WITHOUT HAVING TO MOVE AWAY- I WANT TO. ASO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE. YOU KNOW A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL BUT I WOULD ASK FOLKS WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL TO JUST CONSIDER WHETHER EIGHTY LAW. WHICH HAS BEEN IN PLACE NOW FOR GETTING CLOSE TO FIVE YEARS- HAS LED TO THE IMPACTS THAT THEY'RE DESCRIBING ABOUT. THIS BILL- I THINK THAT SB NINE IS ABOUT MAKING A DIFFERENCE ONE UNIT AT A TIME- AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. ALSO NOTE. THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN OWNER OCCUPIED REQUIREMENT WHICH MEANS THAT HOMEOWNERS WILL HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER THEIR SPACE AND SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS. THE FACT THAT THIS IS OPTIONAL MEANS AT THE STATE WE ARE NOT FORCING ANYTHING IT'S UP TO AGAIN. BLOCK BY BLOCK HOME OWNER BY OWNER TO DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO- I KNOW OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ROCKLAND IS NO LONGER- HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM TODAY BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT LAST YEAR. I THINK WE'RE ALL FRUSTRATED THIS DIDN'T GET DONE LAST YEAR- BUT THAT'S NOT A REASON FOR US TO NOT DO IT THIS YEAR IN FACT IT'S- ALL THAT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT WE HAVE TO GET IT DONE THIS YEAR. AND I THINK MANY OF US WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR LAST YEAR WE HAD THE WORST PANDEMIC IN A HUNDRED YEARS. IT REQUIRED TEMPORARY SHUTDOWNS PANDEMIC RECESSION WILDFIRES SOCIAL PROTEST MEMBERS WHO GOT CODED. THAT'S WHAT CHALLENGES LAST YEAR BUT- I THINK IT'S OUR JOB TO DO THE PEOPLE'S WORK AT THIS POINT- ONE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY IS- YOU KNOW THERE WAS A SUGGESTION AROUND. WHAT INTERESTS ARE SORT OF DRIVING THIS AND- I WOULD SAY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS A CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. THERE ARE MANY STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE STATE OR INVOLVED IN HOUSING. EVERY STAKEHOLDER HAS THEIR PARTICULAR. IDEA OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND IT'S MY PERSPECTIVE THAT I THINK THE REASON WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IS THAT FOR EVERY REAL PROPOSED SOLUTION LIKE THIS ONE. THERE ARE MANY OPPOSITION- LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. UPSETTING THE STATUS QUO. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN FOR YEARS AROUND HOUSING POLITICS IN THE STATE IS THAT NOTHING HAPPENS. OR PUT ANOTHER WAY. DIFFERENT INTERESTS OR FIGURE OUT HOW TO SAY NO. I THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE TODAY TO SAY YES I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW VOTING. TO MOVE THIS FORWARD WILL TAKE COURAGE BUT I APPRECIATE THE COURAGE THAT IT TAKES TO SAY THE STATUS QUO IS BROKEN. TO SAY THAT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE SOME HARD STEPS TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS AND WITH THAT I'M NOT ONLY HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. BUT I'M HAPPY TO RECOMMEND THAT OUR COLLEAGUES MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD IN WITHOUT A CERTAIN FINAL COMMENTS. LIKE TO ASK THE GOOD CENTER TO MAKE ANY CLOSING REMARKS THIS IS HERE AGAIN- SINCERELY MEANNESS I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP- YEAR IN YEAR. YEAR AFTER YEAR ON ALL ISSUES O HOUSING NOT JUST HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT WALKING THE WALK IN YOUR HOMETOWN OF THECITY COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO. NUMBER TWO- JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO EACH OF THE COLLEAGUES. FOR THIS ROBUST DIALOGUE TODAY- AND I KNOW THAT AT THE SECONDS IS INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR YOU TAKING THE TIME TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION TODAY AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IT WITH HER HERE OVER THE PAST.

HISTORICALLY INVISIBLE TO POLICYMAKERS AS HOT ONLY BEGAN TO SEGREGATING DATA BY GENDER TWENTY FIFTEEN. UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN'S HOMELESSNESS HAS SURGED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS INCREASING BY 20% NATIONALLY. WHILE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ON HOUSE WOMEN HAS REMAINED FLAT. TODAY MORE THAN HALF OF ALL WOMEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS NATIONALLY ARE NOW DOING SO BY THEMSELVES. YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN MAKE UP 33% OF ALL OUR HOUSELESS NEIGHBORS.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THINKS THE FIRST TIME IT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE MY RECOLLECTION IS CORRECT- THANK YOU THREE FOUR EIGHT I'M CARRYING THIS ON BEHALF OF THE REQUEST FROM HABITAT FOR HUMANITY TO FIX THAT THE CORK SO TO SPEAK IN THE DENSITY BONUS LAW THAT THE CLARIFICATION ALLOW NONPROFITS LIKE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY TO SERVE FAMILIES WITH LIMITED INCOMES BY ALLOWING THEM TO PURCHASE A PROPERTY FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP- WHICH CURRENTLY IS NOT IN THE CASE IN THE LAW WITH THAT- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR- ANY MEMBER. YES WHEN WE GO TO YOUR ONE WITNESS- ON THE PHONE LINE TO JAMES JARRARD HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JAMES GERARD AND I AM THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS COORDINATOR AT HABITAT FOR HUMANITY OF ORANGE COUNTY. IN MY ROLE I WORK WITH CITIES AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS. TO HELP FIND NEW WAYS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE AND WORKFORCE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES HABITAT IS CONTINUALLY LOOKING FOR INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO BUILD NEW AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP HOUSING. WHEN HABITAT IS NOT THE DEVELOPER THEMSELVES IN ONE OF THESE SOLUTIONS IS TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL DEVELOPERS USING THE DENSITY BONUS AND ASSIST THEM IN PROVIDING. THE AFFORDABLE UNITS REQUIRED UNDER THE DENSITY LAW ESSENTIALLY HABITAT WOULD ACQUIRE THE AFFORDABLE UNITS BUILT UNDER THE DENSITY BONUS AND SELDOM TO QUALIFIED HABITAT PROGRAM FAMILIES. UNDER OUR MODEL HABITAT ACQUIRES THE AFFORDABLE UNITS AND PLACES ARE FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL COVENANT ON THE HOME. THIS ALLOWED HABITAT TO PURCHASE THE HOME BACK FROM THE PROGRAM FAMILY WHEN THEY ARE READY TO PURCHASE A FAIR MARKET RATE HOME WITH THE EQUITY ACCRUED UNDER THE HABITAT MODEL. HOW DID THAT THEMSELVES THE HOME TO A NEW INCOME QUALIFIED PROGRAM FAMILY IS FOR FIRST READING REFUSAL INSURERS THAT ARE HOMES REMAIN AFFORDABLE IN PERPETUITY. THESE PARTNERSHIPS COULD HELP HABITAT BUILD MORE HOMES FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE READY FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP HOWEVER UNDER CURRENT DENSITY BONUS LAW LANGUAGE HABITAT IS NOT AN ELIGIBLE PURCHASER AT THE NONPROFIT WHICH HAS LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE QUALITY HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. TO LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES. BECAUSE HABITAT TAKES POSSESSION OF THE UNITS IN THE INTERIM WHILE WE QUALIFIED BUYERS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO APPROVE THIS MODEL. THIS IS FLOOD HABITATS ABILITY TO BUILD THESE PARTNERSHIPS WITH DEVELOPERS AND TO PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. SB SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT PROVIDE THE CLARIFICATION ON WHO WOULD BE CONSIDERED A QUALIFIED BUYER. AND THAT NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS LIKE HABITAT CAN HELP MAXIMIZE THE FOR SALE AFFORDABLE UNITS BUILT UNDER THE DENSITY BONUS. ADDITIONALLY THIS MEASURE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT FOR CELL UNITS BUILT UNDER THE DENSITY BONUS WON'T BE LOST TO MARKET RATE WHICH UNDER CURRENT LAW IS TRIGGERED IF UPON RESALE. THEY ARE NOT SOLD TO ANOTHER INCOME QUALIFIED BUYER WITHIN SIX MONTHS SB SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT ENSURES THE HABITAT COULD PURCHASE THESE UNITS TO MAINTAIN THEIR AFFORDABILITY PROVIDING LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES WITH THE STATE'S. DECENT PLACE TO CALL HOME FOR THESE REASONS I HAVE LISTED HABITAT APPS FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SB SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR HERTZBERG AND THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- THAT WANT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

AND TAKING THEM AS AUTHOR REQUESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS IS I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS- I- PROBABLY CYNICAL TIMES A- REINTRODUCTION OF LAST YEAR'S SENATE BILL NINE OH TWO- IT HAS BEEN IT IS A LITTLE NARROWER THAN LAST YEAR'S- BILL- BUT OVERALL VERY SIMILAR- TO THE BILL- THIS BILL. WHICH IS NOT HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR BECAUSE THEY WERE ONLY SINGLE REFERRALS- SB TEN INCENTIVIZES- CITIES AND COUNTIES- TO CONCENTRATE NEW HOUSING DENSITY. IN URBAN IN FILL IN TRANSIT RICH AREAS- BY GIVING CITIES A VOLUNTARY TOOL AND I THINK- SOMETIMES THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT SPREADS AROUND ABOUT LEGISLATION IT'S IMPORTANT. TO NOTE SB TEN IS PURELY VOLUNTARY FOR CITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE TO UTILIZE IT THE CITY IGNORES IT AND TAKES NO ACTION. SB TIME WILL HAVE NO APPLICATION IN THAT CITY. WE FREQUENTLY- TELL CITIES WE WANT YOU TO DO MORE ON HOUSING ONE OF HIS OWN FOR MORE. HOUSING WHAT YOU TO ALLOW MORE HOUSING. BUT THEN WE MAKE A REALLY HARD FOR CITIES TO DO THAT SB TIME- I'VE HEARD THAT LOUD AND CLEAR WITH CITIES THAT PLEASE JUST MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER SB TEN DOES THAT. BY SAYING THAT IF THE CITY DECIDES THAT HE WANTS HIS OWN. FOR SMALL MULTI UNIT CONSTRUCTION UP TO TEN UNITS IN AN INFILL OR TRANSIT RICH AREA. OF THE CITY CAN DO SO IN A MUCH MORE STREAMLINED AND EXPEDITED WAY THIS WILL MAKE CITIES LIVES A LOT EASIER- AND- I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GOOD POWERFUL NEW TOOL. FOR CITIES WE KNOW THE MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING. A LOT OF TIMES WE GET THIS CHOICE OF EUROPE SINGLE FAMILY. OR YOU HAVE A REALLY HUGE- BUILDINGS MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING NEEDS TWO THREE FOUR UP HIM UP TO TEN UNIT BUILDINGS- IS A REALLY GOOD OPTION IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE TO BUILD. IT MELTS INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD MORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY- SHE DOES HAVE TO BE A HUGE BUILDING- AND IT WILL HELP US TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE HOUSING SUPPLY. TO MAKE HOUSING MORE ABUNDANT AND MORE- AFFORDABLE- SO- THIS- LET'S. DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE HOW INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. ARE APPROVED IT'S SIMPLYTHE ZONING. TO STREAMLINE THE ZONING PROCESS. INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS WILL STILL BE DONE HOWEVER THEY WOULD NORMALLY- HERBAL. APPROVED OR NOT APPROVED. BASED ON THE NORMAL APPROVAL PROCESSES CITIES HAVE IN PLACE NOW WHETHER THAT IS A MINISTERIAL PROCESS. OR DISCRETIONARY PROCESS. AS A COLLEAGUES IS A GOOD BILL WORTHY OF SUPPORT.

INTO THE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE ALLOW MAYOR BRAND FOR AND ON THE BEACH AND MARK STIVERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP TO SPEAK- I AM. I REALIZED MARKETS HERE IN THE CHAMBER- WHEN WE START WITH MR STIVERS WHO'S HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM MR STIVERS. GREAT MARKS DIVERS OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. I WANT TO START BY SAYING WE GREATLY APPRECIATE CENTER WINNERS ROLES THE CHAMPION FOR HOUSING. AND WE'RE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE GOAL OF THIS BILL TO GROW THE HOUSING STOCK- GENERALLY. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO ONE SINGLE PROVISION THAT WAS ADDED IN LATE MAY WE MUST- REPOSE UNLESS AMENDED- THIS PROVISION ACTUALLY REDUCES THE ABILITY OF EXISTING OPPORTUNE REDUCES EXISTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNDER TWO SCENARIOS. BY LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO USE THE PERMIT STREAMLINING AND OR THE SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS THIS LEGISLATURE SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR WE HAVE OFFERED HIM AN AMENDMENT AND WE'RE HOPING TO HEAR BACK VERY SOON ON THAT WERE WE APPRECIATE HIS IS CONSIDERATION. AND IN GENERAL THE AMENDMENT WOULD TREAT THE UP SONY TO TEN UNITS PER PARCEL AS AN OVERLAY ZONE SO THAT DEVELOPERS COULD STILL USE THE UNDERLYING ZONING THE OF THE CURRENTLY IS OWNING THE CURRENT ZONING. TO DO PROJECTS THAT ARE LARGER THAN TEN UNITS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU LET'S NOW GO TO MAYOR BRANDS ON THE PHONE LINE. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE CHIU AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK MY NAME IS BILL BRANDON HAVE BEEN ELECTED MAYOR OF REDONDO BEACH FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. RECENTLY REELECTED FOR ANOTHER FOUR REDONDO BEACH IS ELEVEN THOUSAND RESIDENTS PER SQUARE MILE MORE DENSELY POPULATED IN LONG BEACH IN FACT WE HAVE THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM HERE IN REDONDO BEACH. MUCH OF S. B. RESTATE THE OBVIOUS THAT CITIES CAN REZONING A PARCEL FOR TEN RESIDENTIAL UNITS PER ACRE. WE CAN ALREADY DO THAT AND WE HAVE FOR MUCH MORE WE DON'T NEED SB TEN. THIS BILL DOES ALLOW US TO CIRCUMVENT SEEK WITH- HOWEVER BUT WE WOULDN'T WHY WOULD WE NOT WANT TO ANALYZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE CHANGE THAT COULD MEAN THE ADDITION OF HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS. SHE WAS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO ALLOW GROWTH WITHOUT DESTROYING OUR QUALITY OF LIFE. SB TEN AT THE MARKET RATE OR LUXURY HOUSING BILLS. IT DOES NOTHING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN FACT SIMPLY ALLOWING MORE MARKET RATE HOUSING DRIVES UP THE DEMAND TO BUILD MORE MARKET RATE HOUSING. AND THE COST OF BUILDING FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS NEEDED. CITIES DON'T BUILD HOUSING THAT THEY DOESN'T BUILD HOUSING DEVELOPERS BUILD HOUSING AND THEY WANT TO BUILD MORE MARKET RATE LUXURY HOUSING. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY'S AND WHO CAN BLAME THEM SB TEN ENABLES MORE OF THIS. NOT ONLY DID THAT THE TENANT NOR THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MOST IMPORTANTLY A SECTION OF IT VIOLATES ARTICLE TWO OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WHICH SIMPLY STATES QUOTE INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM POWERS MAY BE EXERCISED BY THE ELECTORS OF EACH CITY- COUNTY. UNDER PROCEDURES BY THE LEGISLATURE SHALL PROVIDE. THIS IS NOT TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT IT'S JUST VERY SIMPLE NISSHIN SHIPPING REPRIMAND POWERS MAY BE EXERCISED BY THE LECTORS IN EACH CITY OR COUNTY. THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T SIMPLY PASSED THE LAW TO UNDO THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE PROVIDED BY THE CONSTITUTION. AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES A STATEWIDE PUBLIC VOTE NOT A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE. CENTER WIENER WITH THROUGH THAT SECTION OF SB NINE OH TWO LAST YEAR YOU SHOULD REMOVE IT AGAIN. SB TEN IS ENVIRONMENTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE DOES NOTHING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOU CAN DRIVE UP THE COST OF HOUSING. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THAT'S THE REAL PURPOSE OF THIS BILL OVER RIGHT VOTER APPROVED INITIATIVES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU KNOW VOTE ON S. B. TEN I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS POINT NOW LET'S GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. THAT OPPOSE SB TEN. FIRST HERE IN THE CA.

TWENTY FIVE JUST WANNA KNOW WHERE E'RE AT THE FIFTEEN MINUTE MARK SO WE'RE GOING TO BRING THIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION. COLLEAGUES ANY DISCUSSION. THIS PROMOTION OF THE BILLS ARE SECOND THERE'S BEEN A SECOND ANY COMMENTS MR GABRIEL. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ME FOR THIS BILL COULD YOU JUST- MAYBE WALK EVERYBODY A LITTLE BIT THREE SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS. THAT YOU ALLUDED TO HERE- PARTICULARLY AS THEY WOULD RELATE. TO OPEN SPACE AND VOTER INITIATIVES I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE. ARE SHORT THANK YOU ARE SORRY WRONG FOLDER ON THE- I TRIED DIFFERENT WITHOUT HER. YES SO THE WELL THERE WERE TWO AMENDMENTS THAT WITH THAT ONE IS- TAKING THE- IT'S ALWAYS OUT OF THE BILL WITH THE ZONING CHANGES VERY COMPLICATED WE DECIDED TO WORK WITH THE FOLKS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT TOWARDS POTENTIAL FUTURE LEGISLATION HOW WE DEAL WITH HOAS WE DON'T FEEL LIKE WE DON'T NEED TO HANDLE IN THIS BILL- BUT THE OTHER PIECE. WAS- ABOUT THE LOCAL VOTER INITIATIVES IN THE BILL AS IN PRINT RIGHT NOW. I CITY COUNCIL IN IMPLEMENTING- AND ESCHATON REZONING. COULD DO SO EVEN IF- AN INITIATIVE WOULD HAVE. PREVENTED THAT- THE AMENDMENT THAT WE HAVE REQUESTED THE COMMITTEE TO- IMPOSE WHICH IS NOW IN THE COMING THREE FOR ACCEPTED TODAY. DRAMATICALLY NARROWS THAT POWER OF THE CITY COUNCIL- AND SO IT BASICALLY WILL COMPLETELY REMOVE THE ABILITY OF A CITY COUNCIL TO TOUCH ANY KIND OF. OPEN SPACE PROTECTION GREENBELT. PARKING RECORD PARKER RECREATIONAL SPACE ANYTHING THAT'S LIKE A NON RESIDENTIAL. OPEN SPACE FOR LACK OF A BETTER BROADER TERM. ON IF YOU HAVE THE CITY HAS A OPEN SPACE PROTECTION AGREE ABOUT IT CETERA. DOT MEASURE. BE AMENDED- MUCH NARROWER- PROVISION HERE WILL NOT WHAT WILL MEAN TO THE CITY COUNCIL CAN NOT DO ANYTHING. TO OVERRIDE THAT BALLOT MEASURE- SO IT WOULD LIMITED ONLY WHERE- WHERE THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE ZONING ITSELF. AND WE ALSO ARE PROVIDING EVEN IN THAT NARROW CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IS MUCH LESS COMMON- IT WILL REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE COUNCIL. TO DO THAT- AND AS YOU KNOW ONE OF MY pTO ME WHO VOTED FOR THIS BILL WHO DOESN'T NORMALLY OVER MY HOUSING BILLS. THAT CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR VOTES SO WE DRAMATICALLY. NARROWED THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION. YES YOU CENTER I THINK I HAVE A I HAVE A SUSPICION ABOUT WHO THAT MIGHT PAY- THAT VOTED FOR IT AND AM I CORRECT THIS THIS THIS TOOL THAT YOU WOULD BE PROVIDED CITIES. IT'S COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY CORRECT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I CITY COUNCIL COULD DECIDE TO USE IF THEY WANTED AND ALSO A CITY THAT DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS WOULD BE FREE NOT TO USE IT THAT'S CORRECT- I HEARD A LOUD AND CLEAR. OF MY LIFE A LOT OF PREVIOUS HOUSING BILL I DID CITY SAYING JUST GIVE US MORE TOOLS. AND I THINK SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO HAVE STANDARDS AND RULES AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO GIVE VOLUNTARY TOOLS. AND THIS IS A TOTALLY VOLUNTARY BILL BILL IF A CITY THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK TO OPT OUT. IF THE CITY DOES NOTHING TO SING NOR IS IT. THEN THE BILL HAS NO APPLICATION THAT CITY ONLY IF THE CITY AFFIRMATIVELY. THE CITY COUNCIL PASSES AN ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION ONLY VAN THE CITY OFTEN OTHERWISE IT HAS NO IMPACT PURELY VOLUNTARY. YEAH I THINK I THINK YOU CENTER ONO THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT I THINK THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINTS THAT THAT ARE WORTHY OF BEING ELEVATED. YOU KNOW I'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH FOLKS IN MY COMMITTEE AND ALSO WITH A LOT OF LOCAL IF. ELECTED OFFICIALS ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO- YOU KNOW HAVE HAVE WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT HOUSING POLICY. AND ONE OF YOU KNOW IN IN SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED ABOUT THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS DON AND I'M FRUSTRATED WITH VOTES THAT I'VE TAKEN. IN YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS A LOT OF THESE FOLKS HAVE SENT TO ME AS- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT ANTI HOUSING WE CAN ALL IT'S THAT THERE'S A HOUSING CRISIS WE JUST BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN TODAY WHICH HAVE ADDRESSED THE PRIMARY CONCERNS THAT I'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS IN MY COMMUNITY- AND JUST WITH THE ENTIRE THRUST OF THE BILL. I THINK IT REALLY CALLS INTO QUESTION FOR A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS RIGHT THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS A BILL THAT FUNDAMENTALLY PRESERVES LOCAL CONTROL- IS VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE US. SENATOR GLAZERS WHO VOTED FOR WHO IS A STRONG PROPONENT OF LOCAL CONTROL SO I THINK THIS IS. I WOULD HOPE THAT WITH THESE AMENDMENTS THAT A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO CALLED IN TODAY WHO MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS. WOULD WOULD COME OFF IN OPPOSITION IN THE BILL- BECAUSE IF YOUR CONCERN IS REALLY ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL IF IT'S REALLY ABOUT PRESERVING OPEN SPACE. THEN YOUR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED- AND SO I WANTED TO YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO FOLKS IN IN MY COMMUNITY HAD SOME CONCERNS YEARS YOU KNOW- PROTECTING OPEN SPACE PRESERVING OPEN SPACE A SACROSANCT IN MY COMMUNITY- AND WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN TODAY I AM VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL WE DO HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS WE DO NEED TO PROVIDE MORE TOOLS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WANT TO ADDRESS IT I THINK THIS IS. A THOUGHTFUL POLICY THAT THREADS THE NEEDLE. ON ADDRESSING A LOT OF CONCERNS. AND WE DO NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ABOUT OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND SO. ON EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THAT THE NOT EVERYBODY IN MY COMMUNITY- IS GOING TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE DETAILS OF THIS I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP. FOR IT AND I'M PLEASED TO VOTE FOR TODAY. THANK MS WORKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT. TO THINK. WIENER THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORTH THE BILL. ALL THE WORK YOU DO AND HOUSING AND WOULD JUST LOVE TO ADD MY NAME ON AS A CO AUTHOR. AND I'M SURPRISED I'M NOT ONE ALREADY BUT- LOVE TO BE ADDED. ANY OTHER COMMENTS COLLEAGUES MS WORKS OF THIS KEEP IT SHORT AGAIN- THIS GIVES JUST ANOTHER TOOL TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CHOOSE TO USE- THEY CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD BUT IT'S AN OPTION AND THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. AND WITH THAT I WILL ALSO JUST ADD MY THANKS TO YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS- I THINK MANY OF US PARTICULAR MYSELF BELIEVE IT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CITIES TO ALLOW FOR- MODERATE. AND MODERATE MODERATE DENSITY INFILL HOUSING I ALSO JUST APPRECIATE YOUR WORK TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AND FOR TAKING COMMITTEE MEMONS TOP ADDRESSES CONCERNS ARE YOUR TO KEEP WORKING WITH OTHER PARTIES- THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND WITH THAT HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL. LET ME ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENTS. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION COLLEAGUES AND- I WAS A SAY IN TERMS OF OPEN SPACE IT ACTUALLY GOES BEYOND THE BALLOT MEASURES. BECAUSE CENSUS FOCUSES ON AN INFILL DEVELOPMENTS- OPEN SPACES EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT PROTECTED BY A BALLOT MEASURE. PARK FRANKLY NOT EVEN GONNA BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS BILL SO THIS IS FRANK FUNDAMENTALLY ANTI SPRAWL- BILL AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS COLLEAGUES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE.

I JUST WANT TO THANK CENTER WIENER- FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD I THINK. OFTEN TIMES- POLICY MAKERS WERE CRITICIZED FOR MAKINGPOLICY BASED ON ANECDOTES AND WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT DATA IS TO MAKING SMART. INFORMED DECISIONS- OUR STATE H. C. D. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY ELEMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING. A STATE HOUSING PLAN THAT RELIES ON DATA AND- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TO INFORM OUR EFFORTS TO INCREASE SUPPLY. WITH THAT THIS WORKS- AS I THINK THE AUTHOR AS WELL WHEN I WANT TO THINK ABOUT TOO I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF DATA- WE'LL CONTINUE THAT. FIGHT NEXT YEAR FOR RENTAL REGISTRY BUT WANT TO ADD MY NAME IS A CO AUTHOR TO THIS BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE DON'T WANT TO- HAVE. ANECDOTAL POLICY MAKING WHAT EVIDENCE BASED POLICY MAKING IN THIS BODY. I'M SO APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS. MR GABRIEL. HELLO OKAY ATTY FINAL COMMENTS BY THE AUTHOR YEAH I WAS IS THAT I HAVE SO I KNOW I DO SOME CONTROVERSIAL HOUSING BILLS FROM TIME TO TIME THAT'S OKAY IT'S A HARD ISSUE AND HOUSING BILLS ARE OFTEN CONTROVERSIAL I REALLY HAD HOPED THAT'S JUST THE BASIC DATA BILL- WOULD BE A LITTLE LESS CONTROVERSIAL- BUT WHAT WE SEE FROM SOME OF THE SAME EOPLE WHO CALL AND ON ALL THESE BILLS OPPOSING THEM. DON'T TELL THE CITY'S WHAT TO DO WE OPPOSE THAT. BUT DON'T GIVE ANY VOLUNTARY TOOLS TO THE CITIES WE OPPOSE THAT TOO. AND DON'T COLLECTED ON HOUSING- THIS IS A GOOD BILL WE NEED THE DATA I ASKED HER I DON'T. WITHOUT MADAM SECRETARY. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHE'LL HI SHE LIVES HERE TO. GABRIEL HI GABRIEL I KALRA KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN QUICK SILVA. HI QUICK SILVA I WICKS WIXII THAT BILL HAS FOR VOTES YOUR BILLS ON CALL IN THE FINAL BILL OF THE DAY. FILE ITEM SIX S. B. FOR SEVENTY EIGHT CENTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I ALSO WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND ANALYSIS- AS BEFORE SEVENTY EIGHT IS- IT'S A TECHNICAL BILL THAT WILL ENSURE THAT ONE OF CITY HAS VOLUNTARILY ZONES THE SMALL MULTI UNIT BETWEEN THREE AND TEN UNITS- ABOUT ARBITRARY AND RESTRICTIVE SQUARE FOOTAGE COPS DO NOT MAKE IT PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. TO ACTUALLY BUILD- THOSE UNITS JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY TO CHANGE WHAT THE ZONING AS IT DOESN'T CHANGES OUR INTENSITY OR HOW MANY UNITS OF HOUSING DOESN'T CHANGE THE HEIGHT FOR THE SETBACKS. OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THIS IS- OVER ONE ONLY ABOUT- FLOOR AREA RATIO- F. A. R. WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A SQUARE FOOTAGE COP THAT CITIES OFTEN USE- TO PREVENT FOR EXAMPLE- SMALL SINGLE FAMILY HOMES FROM BECOMING MCMANSIONS BY HAVING THAT KIND OF BOTH LIMITATION WHICH FRANKLY IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE ALWAYS- SUPPORTED. BY F. A. R. IS ALSO OFTEN APPLIED TO MULTI UNIT AS WELL AND WHAT HAPPENS IS A CITY WILL- WILL IMPOSE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE COP AND F. A. R. COURSES THE RATIO OF THE LOT SIZE TO THE BUILDING SQUARE FOOTAGE- AND THE F. A. R. WILL BE SO THAT'S WHERE FUNDS WILL BE SO LIMITED- DIED HI THE CITY WILL VOLUNTARILY FOR EXAMPLES ON A PARCEL FOR UNITS- BUT THE SQUARE FOOTAGE COP MY ONLY BE NINE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET DIVIDED BY FOUR IS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE. FEET PER SQUARE UNIT A LOT THAT KIND OF MICRO UNIT AND VERY- SELECT SITUATIONS MIGHT WORK OVERWHELMINGLY IT WON'T AND NO ONE'S GOING TO BUILD IT IN IN MOST SCENARIOS- AND SO- WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SAYS THAT IF THE CITY HAS VOLUNTARILY ZONE FOR BETWEEN THREE AND TEN UNITS THIS IS NOT APPLYING SINGLE FAMILY AREAS THIS ONE NINE ANYWAY ENABLE MCMANSIONS ARE LARGE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES- IT'S ONLY IF THE ZONING IS THREE UNITS. UP TO TEN UNITS ON THE BILL ALL REQUIRE. TO THE FLOOR AREA- B. SUCH THAT IT WILL NOT MAKE THE BUILDING AND- SO IF IT IS- ZONE THREE TO SEVEN UNITS. YES THEY ARE WILL BE ONE POINT NO- IF IT IS EIGHT TO TEN UNITS IT'LL BE ONE POINT. TWO FIVE AND I- JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE IN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. I STARTED GOING THROUGH ITS PROCESS OF REZONING CITY WIDE TO FOUR PLEX. IT ADOPTED A ONE POINT NO FIR IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY ENABLE THE BUILDING. OF FOUR UNITS THE OTHER PIECE OF THE BILL IS THAT- FOR- CITIES AT A MINIMUM LOT SIZES. IF THERE IS A PRE EXISTING LOT THAT IS SMALLER THAN THAT IT'S A LEGAL LIFE. BUT A SMALLER NOT LOT SIZE. I CITY CAN'T USE THAT AS A REASON TO DISALLOW- BUILDING ON THAT LOT IT'S CENTRALLY COULD BE GRANDFATHERED AND- SO COLLEAGUES THIS IS A- SORT OF BELT AND SUSPENDERS. I BILL IT DOES NOT OVERRIDE LOCAL ZONING DENSITY HYATT CETERA IT JUST SAYS IF YOU DON'T FOR ITS CITY IF YOU VOLUNTARILY DONE NOT. WE GOT A LOT PEOPLE ACTUALLY BILL THAT.
