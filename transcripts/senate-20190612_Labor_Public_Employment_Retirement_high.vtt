THERE'S NOT THAT THE SAME

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.460
METHODOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO

CONTRACTORS FOR THESE TYPE OF

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.663

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.798
INAPPROPRIATE TO EXTEND.

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:20.433
LIABILITY WE THINK THE CURRENT

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:22.401
APPROACH WAS THAT CASE BY CASE

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:23.569

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:28.040
PROPER BALANCE.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:28.908
AND SO WE THINK IT'S

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:30.176
INAPPROPRIATE TO AUTOMATICALLY

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:32.478

SOMETIMES BAD JOKES OR THINGS

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:18.077

IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:29.855

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:31.891

SPENDING BUDGET TRAILER BILL

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:22.487
LANGUAGE.

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:23.989
MAKING CHANGES TO THIS SECTION

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:26.258
OF THE LAW THERE'S TWO SEPARATE

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:28.026
LABOR COMMISSIONER REGULATIONS

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:29.194
THAT ARE CURRENTLY PENDING ONE

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:30.896
ON JANITORIAL REGISTRATION ONE

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:31.396
ON THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:20:31.463 --> 00:20:32.698
TRAINING.

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:35.968

00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:37.869
DEPARTMENT FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.005
I ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:40.639
WHICH AUTHORIZED PEER TO PEER

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:41.940

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:44.576
MANDATE IT -- BUT OPEN THE DOOR

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:46.044
TO THAT CONCEPT AND SO.

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:46.812
WE THINK WE SHOULD ALLOW THE

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:48.246
DUST TO SETTLE ON THOSE

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:49.715
REGULATORY CHANGES BEFORE YOU

00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:51.950
MOVE FORWARD -- WITH THIS BILL

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.085
AND WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:54.519
VETOED A SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:55.754
AND SAID WE SHOULD ALLOW

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:57.222
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM

00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:58.857
BEFORE ENGAGING.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.092
AND ACTING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES.

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:01.627
WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL ITSELF

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:04.129
WE HAVE TWO CONCENS NUMBER ONE

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:04.730
OF THE PROVISION THAT REQUIRES

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:05.430
APPLET.

00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:08.066
SUBMIT INFORMATION RELATED TO A

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:09.101
BRANCH LOCATIONS AND

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:11.269
SUBCONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES OF

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:12.738
THOSE SUBCONTRACTORS.

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:13.639
WE THINK IT'S DIFFICULT FOR AN

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:15.107
APPLICANT NECESSARILY HAVE

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:15.841
ACCESS TO THAT TYPE OF

00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:18.443
INFORMATION AS TO THE EMPLOYEES

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.044
SO WE THINK THE PERIOD SHOULD

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.979
AND IN THAT SENSE WHERE YOU

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:22.247
PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:23.515
BRANCH LOCATIONS IN THE SUB

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:23.915
CONTRACT.

00:21:23.982 --> 00:21:25.651
BUT NOT NECESSARY CERTAINLY DOWN

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:29.021
TO THE LEVEL OF EMPLOYEES --

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:30.489
THIS CONCEPT IS CONTAINED IN THE

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:31.590
LABOR COMMISSIONER'S REGULATIONS

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:32.924
AS WELL AND WE RATE BASED

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:34.426
CONCERNS WITHOUT PROPOSAL NOT

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:35.527
PROCESS.

00:21:35.594 --> 00:21:37.095
WITH RESPECT TO THE PEER TO PEER

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:38.497
TRAINING MANDATE.

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:40.332
THIS BILL MANDATES YOU ONLY USE

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:41.667
A PROVIDER THAT'S ON A STATE

00:21:41.733 --> 00:21:43.535

WAGE. TO DO TO DO THE TRAINING

00:21:48.006 --> 00:21:48.373
AND WE THINK THAT'S

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:48.740
INAPPROPRIATE.

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:51.143
WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THERE

00:21:51.209 --> 00:21:52.344

INTO UNION ORGANIZING AND WE

00:21:54.012 --> 00:21:55.380
THINK IT'S JUST AN APPROPRIATE

00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:56.381
TO DO IT THROUGH THIS CHANNEL

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:57.849
WHERE YOU HAVE TO PAY THESE

00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:02.020

CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN LANGUAGE

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.527
ISSUES FOR THIS UNIQUE.

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:09.628
GROUP OF WORKERS AND WE THINK

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:11.596
THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE ISSUES AND

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:13.198
WE THINK A CONVERSATION WE HAD

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:14.700
ABOUT WAYS TO BUILD.

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:16.668
THOSE.

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:17.969

MAKE.

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:45.557
I THINK A VALID POINT IN SOME

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:46.858
SENSE THAT THIS COULD FORCE THE

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:49.394

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:50.662

A COULD CREATE A CONFLICT OF

00:24:01.406 --> 00:24:02.107
INTEREST AND I KNOW THERE ARE

00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:03.375
SOME ISSUES WITH THE BUDGET

00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:05.510

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:07.879

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.144
THAT THE UNION WOULD ALSO TRAIN

00:25:13.211 --> 00:25:15.714
THEM AND AND PROVIDE THIS TYPE

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.849
OF OF EMPOWERMENT TO NON UNION

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:19.384
JANITORS WHO BY THE WAY THOUGH

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:21.019
ARE AT WILL EMPLOYEES AND AND

00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:22.254
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEAK

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.588
UP IN THE WORKPLACE SO WE CAN

00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:23.788
HAVE.

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:25.490
A DISCONNECT THERE -- IF YOU'RE

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:26.892
TALKING ABOUT EMPOWERING WORKERS

00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.860
TO TALK TO EACH OTHER -- YOU

00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:30.395
ALMOST HAVE TO BE UNION -- TO

00:25:30.462 --> 00:25:32.330
PROVIDE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:38.503
PROTECTION IN THAT WORK SO I I

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.538
THINK WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC.

00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:41.439
THE MOST OFFENSIVE THING THAT

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:42.440
THEY CONTINUE BRING UP IS IS THE

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:44.109
FACT THAT YOU'D HAVE TO TEACH

00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:44.809
THESE TRAIN OUR PAY THESE

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:45.610
PRINTERS TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE

00:25:45.677 --> 00:25:46.745
IN FACT IN OTHER COMMITTEES I

00:25:46.811 --> 00:25:46.945
HEARD.

00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:47.412
IT SHOULD BE DOING IT

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:48.179
VOLUNTARILY.

00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:50.448
I WOULD CHALLENGE THEM TO FIND

00:25:50.515 --> 00:25:52.884
AN ATTORNEY WHO TEACHES --

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:55.520
SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE COST AS AS

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:57.989
VALUED AS TREISMAN WAGE YOU KNOW

00:25:58.056 --> 00:25:59.557
IF THERE'S A TURNS OUT THERE WHO

00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:01.693
COME IN AND TEACH THAT COURSE

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.294
FOR TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE I'D

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.328
BE SHOCKED.

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:05.263
PROBABLY WOULD HIRE THEM -- AND

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.232
AND LITERALLY TO IT TO SUGGEST

00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:08.066
THAT THESE JANITORS DON'T

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:10.001
DESERVE COMPENSATION FOR THIS

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:12.070
WORK IT IS ALWAYS A LITTLE

00:26:12.137 --> 00:26:12.671
OFFENSIVE.

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.172
WE'RE ALSO IN A VERY IMPORTANT

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:15.440
TIME PERIOD IN THAT -- THESE

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:16.741
REGULATIONS ARE BEING DEVELOPED

00:26:16.808 --> 00:26:18.643
AND IF WE HAVE A MODEL THAT WE

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.312
CAN USE THAT IS WE WE BELIEVE

00:26:20.378 --> 00:26:21.780
THE BEST MODEL IT'S TIME TO

00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:22.614
INTERVENE RATHER THAN LET

00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:24.249
ANOTHER MODEL BE STEP FORWARD.

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:25.717
AND HAVE TO COME IN THE SAME

00:26:25.784 --> 00:26:27.085
ARGUMENTS WILL OF COURSE BE MADE

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:28.820
WE JUST DECIDED ON THIS MODEL

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:30.322
LET'S GIVE IT WHAT A YEAR TWO

00:26:30.388 --> 00:26:31.957
YEARS FIVE YEARS HOW MANY WOMEN.

00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:33.591
IN THAT PROCESS AND HAVE TO

00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:34.826
CONTINUE TO SUBJECT THEMSELVES

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:36.861
TO ASSAULT AND RAPE WHILE WE LET

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:38.830
THE DUST SETTLE AND I THINK

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:39.597
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD LET THE DUST

00:26:39.664 --> 00:26:40.198
SETTLE.

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:41.399
I DON'T WANT THE DUST TO SETTLE

00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:42.834
I WANT THESE WOMEN TO IT TO BE

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:43.969
ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND

00:26:44.035 --> 00:26:45.603
SO I THINK THE TIME IS NOW I

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.272
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK I'M.

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:54.145
WEAK ENOUGH FOR ME WHEN THEY

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:54.813
BROUGHT ME THIS BILL

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:55.113
[inaudible]

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.448
IF IT.

00:26:56.514 --> 00:26:57.015
SOMETHING LIKE THIS THIS IS

00:26:57.082 --> 00:26:57.849
PROBABLY HOW WE SHOULD APPROACH

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:59.084
WORK IN WORKERS IN TRAINING MORE

00:26:59.150 --> 00:26:59.250
SO.

00:26:59.317 --> 00:27:00.518
NOT THAT WE SHOULD BE SO AFRAID

00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:01.419
OF WORKERS EMPOWERING THEMSELVES

00:27:01.486 --> 00:27:02.854
IN BEING FROM A TODAS AND

00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:03.888
TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:05.590
ACTUALLY TEACHING THEM THE BEST

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:06.524
WAY THAT PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO

00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:07.325
LEARN.

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:08.526
SO I THINK IT'S A MODEL PROGRAM

00:27:08.593 --> 00:27:10.161
AND I I HOPE I'M GLAD YOU'LL BE

00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:12.630

IN MY TIME PROSECUTING HUMAN

00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:38.009
TRAFFICKING CASES I'VE SEEN AS

00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:39.210
CRIME IT HAPPENS IN THE SHADOWS

00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:40.411

HANDLED CASES WHERE THAT LINE OF

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:56.561
DEMARCATION IS WHEN THE X. AT

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:58.563
REAL HORRIBLE EXPLOITATION

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.666
BEGETS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:02.066
HAVE THEM.

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.836
I FOUND OFTEN THAT ARE ARE

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:06.571
VICTIMS DO NOT KNOW -- OUR

00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:10.241
SYSTEM OF LAWS OUR LAWS -- HOW

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:12.076
ARE LAWS ARE ENFORCED HOW ARE

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:13.878
POLICE WORK WHAT THE WORKERS

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:16.014
RIGHTS ARE OR EVEN THAT THERE

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.148
WERE?

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:17.782
FORTY WHEN THEY'RE FOREIGNERS IN

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.017
OUR COUNTRY.

00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:20.585
THEY'RE OFTEN MANIPULATED BY THE

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.520
TRAFFICKER WHO EXPLAINS OUR

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:26.291
SYSTEM TO HIS OR HER ADVANTAGE.

00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:27.458
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:29.194
I'LL TAKE YOUR DOCUMENTS AND

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.495
KEEP THEM SAFE.

00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:31.729

00:30:31.796 --> 00:30:35.133
WITHOUT YOUR DOCUMENTS YOU HAVE

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:35.967
TO HAVE THEM AT ALL TIMES.

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:37.335
WELL THAT'S THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:38.503
COUNTRY BUT BUT THE WORKERS

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:39.737
DON'T KNOW THAT.

00:30:39.804 --> 00:30:41.372
THAT IS ANOTHER WAY TO BOTH

00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:43.608
CONTROL AND ISOLATE THE VICTIMS

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:46.644
IF THEY THINK THEY CAN'T GO OUT.

00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:48.112
WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:51.583
BECAUSE THE THE NATIONAL STUDY

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:55.119
71% OF OF TRAFFICKING LABOR

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:56.487

COUNTRY.

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:59.290
AUTHORIZED AND BY THE TIME THE

00:30:59.357 --> 00:31:01.626
VICTIMIZATION DISCOVERED 69% OF

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:03.261
THEM.

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:04.696
IT THE ARE ON AUTHORIZED.

00:31:04.762 --> 00:31:07.265
SO IT'S GOING ON LANGUAGE IS A

00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:09.300
RED FLAG IN VICTIMIZATION OF

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:11.002
THIS.

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:14.239
THE INABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH

00:31:14.305 --> 00:31:15.173
INCREASES THE CHANCES OF

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.609
VICTIMIZATION THIS BILL.

00:31:17.675 --> 00:31:19.043
EXPLAINS THE RIGHTS IN THE

00:58:30.506 --> 00:58:31.441
LONG TIME COMING AND I'M IN A

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:32.775
MOMENT I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:34.544
BECAUSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:35.178
WE'RE ALL UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:36.312
THERE'S SOME ISSUES WITH

00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:37.513
ACCELERATING ALWAYS.

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.315
BUT JUST THAT WE ENSURE THERE IS

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:40.250
ENOUGH TIME FOR THE STANDARDS

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.784
BOARD WHICH IS IT DISTINCT

00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:43.353
PORTION RIGHT IT AND CAL OSHA

00:58:43.419 --> 00:58:46.789
WAS NOT HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT

00:58:46.856 --> 00:58:47.190
THIS THE SAME WAY.

00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:48.725
AS THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THEY

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:49.659
HAVE THE TIME TO LOOK AT IT MAKE

00:58:49.726 --> 00:58:51.327
ANY AMENDMENTS THEY WOULD LIKE

00:58:51.394 --> 00:58:53.529
TO MAKE AND THE TIME.

00:58:53.596 --> 00:58:54.163
FOR INTEREST GROUPS TO SPEAK AT

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:55.231
THAT POINT.

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:58.935
SO THAT'S OUR CONCERN -- TWO

00:58:59.002 --> 00:58:59.669
EIGHT YOU MAY EXPLAIN THE

00:58:59.736 --> 00:59:01.137
DISTINCTION RIGHT WE AGREE THAT

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:03.840
THE EIGHT YEAR DELAY HERE AT IS

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:04.474
CONSIDERABLE IN FACT THE ENTIRE

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:05.008
TO LIVE.

00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:06.276
THESE LEAD REGULATIONS BEEN

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:08.678
PLACE FIFTY OR SO YEARS OUT OF

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:11.080
DATE WHICH ITSELF IS PROBLEMATIC --

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:12.582
BUT AS THE LATE IN THIS PROCESS

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:14.684
READ THE DIVISION TOOK I BELIEVE

00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:15.885
AROUND SIX YEARS I RECALL

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:17.287
CORRECTLY TO COME OUT WITH THE

00:59:17.353 --> 00:59:18.421
PROPOSED STANDARDS.

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:21.591
AND THEN THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:23.092
THE SERIE A WHICH IS DONE AFTER.

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:23.526
AND IT'S COME OUT.

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:25.862
I WAS ALSO MUCH LONGER INCOMING

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:27.463
THAT ANYBODY $TED

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:29.999
CAME OUT OF BELIEVE TWO THREE

00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:32.235
WEEKS AGO AROUND THERE.

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:33.169
OKAY WAS A COMMENT I WOULD.

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:34.737
OKAY I WAS ONLY HIGHLY BUT

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:36.205
ARRIVING PUBLIC RELEASED AT THAT

00:59:36.272 --> 00:59:38.408
POINT BUT RECENTLY TO THE THE

00:59:38.474 --> 00:59:39.309
POINT IS THAT THIS PROCESS

00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:40.910
HASN'T GONE TO THE STANDARDS

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:41.945
BOARD AND THE STANDARDS WHAT

00:59:42.011 --> 00:59:43.313
HASN'T BEEN THE BODY DELAYING

00:59:43.379 --> 00:59:44.847
THE DIVISION AND ANY KIND OF

00:59:44.914 --> 00:59:46.149
CONTRACT TO PREP THE SERIE A

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:46.616
HAVE BEEN.

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:47.884
DELAYED AND WE WE AGREE THAT'S

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:49.419
REGRETTABLE WE JUST DON'T

00:59:49.485 --> 00:59:50.553
BELIEVE THE STANDARD POOR'S

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:55.525
PROCESS WHICH IS SEPARATE SHOULD

00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:57.226
BE RUSHED FOR THAT REASON.

00:59:57.293 --> 00:59:58.261
AND AS TO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE

00:59:58.328 --> 00:59:59.362
REGULATIONS IF YOU IF YOU'D LIKE

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:00.063
I'VE I'VE READ IN SOME DETAIL

THE PRETTY LENGTHY I'M I'M GLAD

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:03.333
TO TRY TO BE HELPFUL.

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:05.535
THE DETAILS OF EVERITT ISSUE BUT

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:07.470
THAT'S YES OF I AGREE IT'S AN

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:11.407
ISSUE OF TIMING -- AND AS TO THE

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:12.775

THE EXTENDED CHANGES REGULATIONS

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:18.081
IS CONSIDERABLE WE'RE TALKING

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:19.816
THAT 80% REDUCTIONS IN THE

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.217
AMOUNT OF PRESS PRESS OF A LEAD

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:12.428
DEFINES WHEN A PUBLIC SUBSIDY IS

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:13.796
DE MINIMUS FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.298
DETERMINING THE PREVAILING WAGE

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.866
APPLIES PRIVATE PROJECTS USING

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:18.468
PUBLIC FUNDS.

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:19.802
THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT A PUBLIC

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.471
SUBSIDY ON A PRIVATE PROJECT IS

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:23.439
DE MINIMUS SO LONG AS IT IS LESS

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:25.741
THAN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

THOUSAND DOLLARS AND LESS THAN

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:27.376
2%.

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:28.744
OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST.

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:30.546
UNDER CURRENT LAW PROJECT IS NOT

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:32.315
SUBJECT THE PREVAILING WAGE Là

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:33.783
EVEN IF IT RECEIVES A PUBLIC

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:34.717
SUBSIDIES SUBSIDY.

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:37.220
IT THAT SUBSIDY IS DE MINIMUS IN

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:38.955
THE CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT.

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:39.989
CHOOSE THE TERM DE MINIMUS IS

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:41.357
NOT DEFINED IN THE STATUTE THERE

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.658
IS NO GUIDANCE AS TO THE

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:44.994
APPROPRIATE LEVEL PUBLIC SUBSIDY

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:45.595
THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DE

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:46.696
MINIMUS.

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:47.697
THIS IS LED.

01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:48.731
THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:50.066
RELATIONS TO MAKE INCONSISTENT

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:51.801
RULINGS AS TO WHAT IS DE MINIMUS

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:53.369
LEADING TO CONFUSION AND

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.537
LITIGATION ON WHAT THE TERM

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.873
ACTUALLY MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE IN

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:57.373
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.174
DEPARTMENT APPROVED AS DE

01:02:58.241 --> 01:03:00.143
MINIMUS A ONE POINT SIX MILLION

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:02.378
DOLLAR PUBLIC SUBSIDY TO NINETY

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.312
FIVE MILLION DOLLAR NOT

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:05.381
PROCESSING FACILITY PROJECT.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.650
SINCE IT WAS ONLY ONE POINT 75%.

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:08.784
OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST BUT

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:10.219
THEN WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT ONE

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:11.254
POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:16.225
OF TAXPAYER MONEY -- CERTAINLY

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:18.161
IS SIGNIFICANT.

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:18.995
ABOUT A SUBSIDY FOR A PRIVATE

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:20.029
PROJECT IS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:20.663
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:21.330
2% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST IS

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:23.099
A NOTABLE TAXPAYER INVESTMENT

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:24.867
AND IT IS REASONABLE. TO REQUIRE

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:26.002
PREVAILING WAGES AT THE

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:27.703
DEVELOPER WANTS A PUBLIC SUBSIDY

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.205
OVER THAT AMOUNT.

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:30.506
UNDER THIS BILL NO DEVELOPER IS

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:31.440
REQUIRED TO TAKE A PUBLIC

01:03:31.507 --> 01:03:33.509
SUBSIDY OF THE DE MINIMUS AMOUNT

01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:35.344
IF THEY DO NOT WANT TO PAY THE

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:36.479
PREVAILING WAGE.

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:37.580
OF HOLDING A PREVAILING WAGE

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:38.848
LAWS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:41.083
ENSURE THAT CONTRACTORS ARE NOT

01:03:58.267 --> 01:04:02.605
PRESSURE THAT I KNOW.

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:05.374
OF A LOT OF MEANING [inaudible]

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:07.210
THE TRUE.

01:04:07.276 --> 01:04:08.477
THIS IS YOUR MEMBERS OF SOCIETY

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:09.011
AS A BEHALF OF THE STATE

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:09.679
BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:10.279
COUNCILTHE PROUD SPONSORS OF

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:11.881
THIS LEGISLATION -- WE ARE --

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:12.715
DID COMPLETE AGREE WITH

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:13.316
EVERYTHING THAT THEY ASSEMBLY

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:14.217
MEMBER MENTION ABOUT THE INTENT

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:15.017
OF THIS BILL AND WHAT IT

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:16.219
ACTUALLY ACHIEVES OR SEEKS TO

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:16.786
ACHIEVE.

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:18.387
ON THE PREVAILING WAGE STATUTES

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:21.524
WERE ENACTED TO ENSURE THAT IT

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:22.191
WAS A READILY AND AVAILABLE

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:22.458
SKILLED.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.126
WORKFORCE FOR THE NUMBER OF

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:25.261
PUBLIC PROJECTS THAT WERE

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:27.630
AVAILABLE BY THE BY THE STATE OR

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:28.264
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:30.433
THE EXPANSION OF THE PREVAILING

01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:32.501
WAGE AND THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.070
INCLUDED THE TERM TO MINIMIZE

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:35.504
BUT IT WAS NOT A FIGHT.

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:36.472
AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:39.242
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS CHOSE 2% AS

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:41.377
THE NUMBER A PERCENTAGE OF THE

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:42.945
TOTAL PROJECT COST.

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:43.512
BUT AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:45.514
MENTIONED THOSE NUMBERS ARE

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:47.183
COMING IN VERY HIGH MILLIONS OF

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.618
DOLLARS IN TERMS OF PUBLIC

01:04:48.684 --> 01:04:50.920
SUBSIDIES TO A PRIVATE DEVELOPER.

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:53.222
SO IT IS CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:54.624
OF THE PREVAILING WAGE LAW THAT

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:57.026
ONLY INSURERS THE WORKERS GET A

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:58.527
FAIR AND DECENT HEY.

01:04:58.594 --> 01:05:00.296
BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE USE OF

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:01.464
APPRENTICES OF PROMISES THAT I

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.099
THINK A LOT OF US YOU HAVE

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:07.703
DEBATED HERE LEGISLATION TO TRY

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:08.671
TO ATTRACT MORE.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:09.805
WHAT THAT DOES FOR ANY TYPE OF

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:11.007
DEVELOP OR CONTRACTOR IS IT

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.875
PROVIDES THE NEXT GENERATION OF

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:14.210
SKILLED WORKERS AND AS YOU KNOW

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:15.945
THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSIONS OVER

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:16.912
THERE BEING A LETTER LABOR

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:18.247
SHORTAGE OF SKILLED WORKERS TO

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:19.482
ACHIEVE NOT ONLY?

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:20.850
PUBLIC WORKS IN THE FUTURE BUT

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:22.351
ALSO IN THE HOUSING RESIDENTIAL

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:24.820
MARKET -- WHICH WE BELIEVE FOR A

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:26.055
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:28.124
THEY'RE EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.992
BUT IT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF THE

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.394
WAGES HAVE NOT KEPT UP.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.195
WITH INFLATION AND THE COST OF

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:36.032
LIVING AND SO IT MAKES IT LESS

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:38.100
ATTRACTIVE FOR WORKERS TO JUST.

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:39.268
CHAU ALSO THERE ISN'T AN

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:39.969
INHERENT.

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:41.504
SYSTEM WITHIN THE RESIDENTIAL

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.039
MARKET TO ACTUALLY TRAIN WORKERS

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.573
IN THAT RESPECT WE ARE NOT

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.043
CHANGING ANY TYPE OF A CURRENT

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:48.778
EXEMPTION AS IT EXISTS WITHIN

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:49.845
THE LABOR CODE AND THERE'S A

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:51.881
LITANY OF EXEMPTIONS FOR

01:05:51.947 --> 01:05:53.249
RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS IN THE CODE.

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:54.684
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THERE

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:56.686
SHOULD BE A MONETARY CAP ON THE

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:58.020
AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SUBSIDIES SO

01:05:58.087 --> 01:05:59.522
THAT THE DEVELOPER CAN MAKE A

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:00.923
CHOICE WHETHER TO ACCEPT THAT

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:01.624
AND THEN TRIGGERED THE

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:03.793
PREVAILING WAGE OR TO ACCEPT UP

01:06:03.859 --> 01:06:05.394
TO THE AMOUNT AND THEN DID?

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.997
NOT RECEIVE THE REST FOR THOSE

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:09.699
REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

BASICALLY IS SOLVE THE ISSUE

01:38:54.928 --> 01:38:56.397
THAT WE SAW HAPPEN A LOT LAST

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:57.531
YEAR DURING THE WORST OF THE

01:38:57.598 --> 01:38:58.465
FIRES WHERE.

01:38:58.532 --> 01:39:00.367
WHEN THE AIR WAS EXTREMELY BAD

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:01.669
IN MANY AREAS AROUND THE STATE

01:39:01.735 --> 01:39:03.203
WE WENT AROUND AND SAW THAT LOTS

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.505
OF WORKERS WERE ESSENTIALLY

01:39:04.571 --> 01:39:05.439
FORCED TO WORK OUTSIDE IN THIS

01:39:05.506 --> 01:39:06.140
AIR?

WITH NO PROTECTION OF ANY KIND

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:09.376
AND THERE WASN'T MUCH

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:11.111
INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS TO WHAT

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:12.446
THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION WAS

01:39:12.513 --> 01:39:13.947
WHAT KIND OF MASK TO WEAR

01:39:14.014 --> 01:39:15.449
WHETHER OR NOT TO WEAR A MASK

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:16.483
WHETHER WAS REQUIRED.

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:17.351
SO IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT INTO

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:19.620
THE REGULATIONS AND FOUND THAT

01:39:19.687 --> 01:39:21.388
THEY KIND OF RANGE FROM SO VEGAS

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:22.756
TO BE ALMOST USED. TO SO

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:24.124
CUMBERSOME THAT EVERYONE IS JUST

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:25.993
KIND OF IGNORING THEM AND SO WE

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:27.294
PETITION THE CALLUSES STANDARDS

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:28.829

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:32.333
REGULATIONS AND THAT PROCESS IS

01:39:32.399 --> 01:39:33.200
HAPPENING THERE'S BEEN AN

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:34.601
ADVISORY COMMITTEE THERE'S BEEN

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:35.402
ONE HEARING.

01:39:35.469 --> 01:39:37.371
AND A FINAL VOTE IS TENTATIVELY

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:38.872
SCHEDULED FOR JULY EIGHTEENTH

01:39:38.939 --> 01:39:41.508
BUT THE BILL IS STILL NECESSARY

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:43.143
TO BASICALLY KEEP THE PRESSURE

01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:45.145
ON THAT PROCESS.

01:39:45.212 --> 01:39:46.246
AS WE HEARD DURING THE TESTIMONY

01:39:46.313 --> 01:39:46.814
OF A QUIRK BILL THE WORKER

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.915
HEALTH AND SAFETY RULE MAKING

01:39:47.981 --> 01:39:50.184
PROCESS HAS A TENDENCY.

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:52.252
TO DRAG ON FOR YEARS SEVERAL

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:54.288
YEARS IF NOT LONGER AND OVER A

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:56.423
SPAN OF TIME THAT LONG GIVEN THE

01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:57.758
SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY THE FIRES

01:39:57.825 --> 01:39:59.059
WERE LOOKING AT NOW THERE WILL

01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:00.427
BE WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OVER THE

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:02.029
COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS SO.

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:02.696
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:04.365
SOMETHING HAPPENS IN TIME FOR

01:40:04.431 --> 01:40:04.965
THE BOOK OF THIS YEAR'S FIRE

01:40:05.032 --> 01:40:05.766
SEASON.

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:07.234
IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING THE

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:08.635
SPECIFIC WEAKNESSES WITH THE

01:40:08.702 --> 01:40:10.571
RAGS THAT ARE THERE PARTICULARLY

01:40:10.637 --> 01:40:11.705
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR FOR

01:40:11.772 --> 01:40:13.073
EMPLOYERS WHEN THEY DO HAVE TO

01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:14.408
DO SOMETHING THAT.

01:40:14.475 --> 01:40:15.409
RIGHT NOW IT'S KIND OF THE

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:17.044
SUBJECTIVE WHENEVER YOU THINK AN

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:18.779
EXPOSURE IS HARMFUL AND WE WOULD

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:19.913
LIKE TO SWITCH THAT OVER TO A

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.215
MORE CLEAR STANDARD OF WHEN THE

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:22.616
AIR QUALITY INDEX REACHES A

01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:23.884
CERTAIN THRESHOLD.

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:25.152
AND THEN ALSO TO DEAL WITH THE

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:26.320
CUMBERSOME NATURE OF SOME OF THE

01:40:26.387 --> 01:40:27.354

THEY'RE ALLOWED TO WEAR ONE OF

THE AN NINETY FIVE MASKS WHICH

01:40:36.196 --> 01:40:37.164
IS A REALLY FEASIBLE IF YOU'RE.

01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:38.732
A COUPLE HUNDRED OUTDOOR WORKERS

01:40:38.799 --> 01:40:42.536
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN A FIRE

01:40:42.603 --> 01:40:43.904
STARTS AND YOU'VE GOT TO BRING A

01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:44.671

IF A RESPIRATOR DOESN'T FIT

01:42:55.802 --> 01:42:57.871

EXEMPTING FIT TESTING.

AND BILL USED EQUIPMENT L. AS A

01:43:29.503 --> 01:43:31.271
THING IS ACTUALLY SENSUALLY THE

01:43:31.338 --> 01:43:32.739
SAME IS NOT USING IT SO I WANT

01:43:32.806 --> 01:43:34.541
TO BE CAREFUL THAT IN THE

01:43:34.608 --> 01:43:38.612
EXEMPTION.

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:39.179
WE'RE NOT CREATE A SITUATION

01:43:39.246 --> 01:43:40.547
THAT.

01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:42.049
WORKERS FALSELY THINK THE OTHER

01:43:42.115 --> 01:43:42.849
PROTECTION WITH A RESPIRATOR WAY

01:43:42.916 --> 01:43:43.917

01:43:43.984 --> 01:43:44.685
THEY'RE NOT IT'S NOT FITTING

01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:45.218
WELL IT'S NOT BEING USED

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:47.654
APPROPRIATELY WHATEVER SO CAN

01:43:47.721 --> 01:43:52.125
YOU PERHAPS ADDRESS THAT ISSUE --

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:54.628
YES SO THE EMERGENCY REGULAR

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:56.330
REGULATORY LANGUAGE THAT IS

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:57.698
BEING PROPOSED RIGHT NOW DOES

01:43:57.764 --> 01:43:59.566
INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT FOR

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:00.567
TRAINING.

01:44:00.634 --> 01:44:01.668
AND THE TRAINING DOES INCLUDE AN

01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:02.869
APPENDIX THAT GETS INTO THAT

01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:05.038
VERY ISSUE SPECIFICS OF THINGS

01:44:05.105 --> 01:44:07.040
LIKE -- FACIAL HAIR VERY MUCH

01:44:07.107 --> 01:44:08.308
LIMITS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN

01:44:08.375 --> 01:44:09.810
AND NINETY FIVE THAT IT DOES

01:44:09.876 --> 01:44:11.211
NEED TO PROPERLY FIT THE NOSE

01:44:11.278 --> 01:44:12.346
AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT.

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:13.647
BUT THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:44:13.714 --> 01:44:14.181
IS KIND OF FIND A BALANCE

01:44:14.247 --> 01:44:15.482
BETWEEN.

01:44:15.549 --> 01:44:16.984
NOTHING AND IN IN NINETY FIVE

01:44:17.050 --> 01:44:18.352
MASK WITH TRAINING THAT WORKS AS

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:20.654
WELL AS THEY CAN BUT THE

01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:21.755
SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT YOU'RE

01:44:21.822 --> 01:44:22.122
RAISING ABOUT.

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:23.423
HOW TO IF IT'S AS WELL AS A CAN

01:44:23.490 --> 01:44:24.458
IS ONE THAT WE PLAN TO GET MUCH

01:44:24.524 --> 01:44:25.459
MORE IN THE WEEDS OF DURING THE

01:44:25.525 --> 01:44:26.727
PERMANENT RULE MAKING PROCESS

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:28.929
THAT -- SHOULD TAKE ABOUT A YEAR

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:30.364
AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:31.732
EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IT SHOULD

01:44:31.798 --> 01:44:33.667
BE SOMETIME THIS SUMMER SO IT IS

01:44:33.734 --> 01:44:35.135
VERY MUCH A REAL ISSUE AND THE

01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:36.470
THE STANDARD THEY'RE MAKING SURE

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:37.070
THAT THERE IS A MEDICAL

01:44:37.137 --> 01:44:38.205
EVALUATION IF IT TESTING IS

01:44:38.271 --> 01:44:39.573
THERE FOR VERY GOOD REASON AND

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.874
WE WANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT IN

01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:42.309
ALMOST ALL CASES THAT STILL

01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:44.044
REMAINS AND SO WE DEFINITELY

01:44:44.111 --> 01:44:45.345
DON'T WANT TO WE CAN THAT AND WE

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:46.079
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

01:44:46.146 --> 01:44:47.147
LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THE FEDERAL

01:44:47.214 --> 01:44:49.082
STANDARD BUT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT

01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:50.417
WE PLAN TO GET MORE INTO DURING

01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:51.118
THE PERMANENT.

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:52.619
ROLE MAKING STANDARD BUT IN THE

01:44:52.686 --> 01:44:53.687
MEANTIME WHAT I MAKE SURE THAT

01:44:53.754 --> 01:44:55.222
WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO SOMETHING

01:44:55.288 --> 01:44:57.224
AND THAT THIS ISSUE OF WE CAN'T

01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:58.358
GET DOCTORS OUT THERE TO EXAMINE

01:44:58.425 --> 01:44:59.960
THIS MANY WORKERS THAT FAST

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:02.162
DOESN'T LEAVE THEM WITH NOTHING

01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.696
WHICH IS KIND OF WHAT THE

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:04.097
CURRENT REGULATIONS.

01:45:04.164 --> 01:45:05.866

WORKING ON THE ISSUE I I GUESS

01:45:09.403 --> 01:45:10.270
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS FIRST OF ALL

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:11.238
WILL BE SURE. TO GIVE PEOPLE

01:45:11.304 --> 01:45:15.342
FALSE SENSE OF PROTECTION RIGHTS --

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:16.877
HERE'S A MASK.

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:17.911
BUT THEY'RE NOT WEARING

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.546
CORRECTLY SO WHAT AT THE OFFICE

01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:20.681
OR OTHER THINGS -- PERHAPS WITH

01:45:20.747 --> 01:45:22.049
FIT TESTING TO COULD BE SOME WAY

01:45:22.115 --> 01:45:24.918
OF TRAINING CERTAIN.

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:26.420
ALREADY OUT IN THE FIELD AND HOW

01:45:26.486 --> 01:45:28.588

FIVE FIVE THANK YOU COULD SO I I

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.761
MIGHT JUST BE THE CAUTIOUS ABOUT

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:36.329
THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GONNA HAND

01:45:36.396 --> 01:45:37.097
OUT MASKS.

01:45:37.164 --> 01:45:38.365
BECAUSE IT'S AN EMERGENCY WHEN A

01:45:38.432 --> 01:45:40.100
WAVE THE FIT TESTING BUT THEN

01:45:40.167 --> 01:45:40.801
ESSENTIALLY NOW THEY HAVE

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:42.335
AMASSED A SLAP IT ON BUT IT'S

01:45:42.402 --> 01:45:43.603
NOT REALLY PERFORMING ITS

01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:44.771
FUNCTION.

01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:46.206

ACTUALLY PROTECTED AND SO --

01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:55.215
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY. TO TO DO IT

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:56.049
IN A WAY WHERE PERHAPS YOU CAN

01:45:56.116 --> 01:45:57.617
HAVE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD TO FREE

01:45:57.684 --> 01:45:59.686

01:46:01.288 --> 01:46:01.855
THAT.

01:46:01.922 --> 01:46:03.056
BEFORE YOU SEND THEM OUT TO THE

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:05.392
FIELD IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT LONG

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:05.959
TO TEACH SOMEONE HOW TO FIT

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:07.661
THEIR MASK NOW SO THAT THEY'RE

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:09.329
READY. TO HAVE SOME EDUCATION ON

01:46:09.396 --> 01:46:12.099
HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE I JUST

01:46:12.165 --> 01:46:12.666
DON'T WANT PEOPLE RECEIVING

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:13.900

01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:29.015
REALLY NOT THEY'RE GONNA THINK

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:30.283
THEY HAVE PROTECTION AND THAT

01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:31.618
I'D ALMOST PREFER THAT THEY'RE

01:46:31.685 --> 01:46:32.686
NOT OUT IN THE FIELD AND TELL

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:34.321

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:38.325
OTHERWISE THEY'RE EXPOSED AND

01:46:38.391 --> 01:46:38.959
THEY THINK THEY HAVE PROTECTION

01:46:39.025 --> 01:46:39.459
THEY DON'T.

01:46:39.526 --> 01:46:40.627
THAT IS IN THE APPENDIX A OF THE

ALL WEARING MASKS SOME MORE

01:46:51.037 --> 01:46:52.906

01:46:52.973 --> 01:46:53.974
IT'S PORTANTINO THAT.

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.041
PEOPLE NOT HAVE THAT FALSE SENSE

01:46:55.108 --> 01:46:57.144
