00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.877
IT TWO WAYS OF IN THE PLAN AND

00:23:31.943 --> 00:23:33.445
IT'S ALL OUR LIST OF STATUTORILY

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:34.346
EXEMPTED PROJECTS THEN IT'S FINE

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:36.248
BUT IF IT IF IT DIDN'T MAKE THE

00:23:36.314 --> 00:23:37.749
LIST OF THE PROJECTS

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:38.917
SPECIFICALLY LISTED THE TYPES I

00:23:38.984 --> 00:23:39.918
SHOULD FACE PATHETICALLY

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:41.453
LISTENING NINE TWENTY TWO. THEN

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.754
YOU WOULD NEED FOR THE FUTURE

00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:44.656
SEQUENCES THAT MAKE SENSE RIGHT

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:46.658
SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT IF

00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:48.293
WHO KNOWS WHAT SACRAMENTO'S

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.628
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN IS

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:51.396
BUT IF THEY CHOSE TO LOOK AT

00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:53.932
INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND SAY THIS

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:56.034
IS THIS IS WHAT OUR PLAN IS

00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:58.703
VERSUS A CITY WIDE. ROLLING AND

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.705
BIKING AND WALKING BACK TO

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:05.777
TRANSPORTATION PLAN THEY. WOULD

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:07.612
BE SUBJECT TO SEE WHAT WHAT. NO

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:10.048
DATE THE PLAN WOULD NOT WOULD

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:12.250
NOT BE EFFECTIVE THE PROJECT AND

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:14.753
I JUST WANT PLANTS OPERATED

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.288
INDIVIDUAL PROJECT WITH A KIND

00:24:16.354 --> 00:24:18.623
OF PROJECT ENUMERATED IN NINE

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.392
TWENTY TWO IT WOULD NOT BE I

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:22.260
GUESS I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT I

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:23.962
DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE LOCAL

00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:24.963
TRANSPORTATION TYPES ARE DOING

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.731
RIGHT I MEAN THEY MAY PUT THE

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:28.800
TITLE. ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:32.804
PLAN AND IN ALL HAS A BUNCH OF

00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:34.206
PROJECTS IN IT. BUT IF THOSE

00:24:34.272 --> 00:24:35.340
PROJECTS OR NOT. THE KIND

00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:36.975
INCLUDED IN OUR TWENTY TWO IT

00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:40.612
WOULD NOT BE. NINE TWENTY TWO IS

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:41.446
SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:43.582
PROJECTS ARE INCLUDED. IF THEY

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:44.516
PUT SOME RANDOM PROJECT IN

00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:46.351
THAT'S NOT PART OF THAT THAT

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:47.786
WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:48.987
EXEMPTION BUT OKAY SO PEDESTRIAN

00:24:49.054 --> 00:24:50.622
PLAN NOW TO FIND UNDER THE NEW

00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:52.557
AMENDMENTS WOULD BE A PLAN

00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:53.358
DEVELOPED BY LOCAL JURISDICTION

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:54.759
THAT ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:56.294
COORDINATED APPROACH. TO

00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:57.996
IMPROVING PEDESTRIAN

00:24:58.063 --> 00:25:00.799
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAFETY OF

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:03.134
SACRAMENTO'S. ACTIVE PROPOSED

00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:05.036
ACTORS AFTER TRANSPORTATION PLAN

00:25:05.103 --> 00:25:07.572
DOES THAT BEEN THERE THERE THERE

00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:09.908
BUT IF THERE ARE. ACTIVE PLAN

00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:11.443
WHATEVER THE NEWSPAPER SAYING

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:12.844
INCLUDES A BUNCH OF INDIVIDUAL

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:15.814
PROJECTS THAT SAY WE'RE GOING TO

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:17.082
SCOOP THEM UP. THEN I WOULD

00:25:17.148 --> 00:25:19.384
THINK THAT PARAGRAPH SIX WOULD

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:22.254
SAY IF UNLESS ANOTHER SEQUEL

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.755
EXEMPTION APPLIES. YOU'RE NOT

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:27.125
COVERED. I MEAN AAIN I JUST GOT

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:28.727
THIS THIS MORNING SO I APOLOGIZE

00:25:28.793 --> 00:25:30.428
YEAH I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE

00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:32.264
SURE I KNOW WHAT I'M VOTING ON

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:33.498
LET ME TRY TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE-

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:35.767
AND MAYBE THAT'LL SO LET'S SAY

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:36.635
IN THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:38.970
PLAN IT SAID WE WANT TO ADD.

00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:40.572
BIKE LANES TO. BAKER STREET

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:41.873
DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO IN ORDER TO

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.208
RESTRICT THE PAVEMENT TO ADD

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:44.776
THOSE BIKE LANES. THAT SPECIFIC

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:46.211
PROJECT ITSELF IS COVERED UNDER

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:47.812
THE EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL.

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:50.448
LET'S SAY THAT PLAN ALSO SAID.

00:25:50.515 --> 00:25:52.350
AND WE WANT TO BUILD A BRAND NEW

00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:55.120
. BIKE PATH THROUGH FARMLAND.

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:56.521
THAT ISN'T CURRENTLY IN THE

00:25:56.588 --> 00:25:58.290
PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY AND IS A MAJOR

00:25:58.356 --> 00:25:59.557
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WITH A BRIDGE

00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:01.026
OVER A CREEK. THAT WOULD STILL

00:26:01.092 --> 00:26:02.761
REQUIRE FURTHER SEQUIN HOUSES

00:26:02.827 --> 00:26:04.930
BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN EXEMPTION

00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:07.032
SPECIFIED IN THE BILL DOES THAT

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:08.633
MAKE SENSE. YEAH I MEAN I THINK.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.834
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:11.836
A PROJECT ON A PLAN AND AN H.

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:14.472
JURISDICTIONS HAS A VERY LIBERAL

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:16.408
APPLICATION OF WHAT THEY THINK A

00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:18.476
PLAN IS VERSUS A PROJECT. NO THE

00:26:18.543 --> 00:26:20.812
OLD FASHIONED PROJECTS. I THINK

00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:23.214
I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT WAS SO

00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:27.319
I'M GONNA. AND JUST. ANYTHING

00:26:27.385 --> 00:26:29.220
THAT WAS MY QUESTION IS IT JUST

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:31.489
JUST SEEMS TO BE THAT WE'RE ONE

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:33.191
WE DON'T HAVE THESE ACTIVE

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:35.560
TRANSPORTATION PLANS THAT EXIST

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:36.594
TWO PEOPLE ARE DEVELOPING RIGHT

00:26:36.661 --> 00:26:39.230
NOW IN AND THEN WE'RE HAVING

00:26:39.297 --> 00:26:41.132
RIGHT NOW WE'RE DEFINING THEM

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:41.733
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN STATE

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.235
STATUTE RIGHT YEAH AND SO IT'S

00:26:44.302 --> 00:26:46.471
NOT LIKE IT'S BODIES AGREE SO

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:48.740
WHAT THEY ARE BUT THREE THREE

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:50.675
FOR THE FIRST OF ALL IN TERMS OF

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:52.510
WHAT ATP IS ARE WE HIGH IF YOU

00:26:52.577 --> 00:26:53.411
LOOK AT WHO'S SPONSORING THE

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:54.713
BILL AND WHOSE ENGAGE IN THIS

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:56.281
BILL IT'S EXACTLY THE ENTITIES

00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:57.382
THAT ARE CREATING THOSE. PLANS

00:26:57.449 --> 00:26:58.883
SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE JUST

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.318
RANDOMLY CREATING- AND THEN

00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:02.320
EVERYONE'S GONNA HAVE TO LIVE

00:27:02.387 --> 00:27:03.321
WITH ITS BEING THIS IS THAT

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:05.090
SOMETHING THAT DOES EXIST AND

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:06.825
YES WE'RE GONNA WILL BE GREAT TO

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:09.294
WORK TO BRING A PUT A SPECIFIC

00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:11.896
DEFINITION IN THE BILL- AND I

00:27:11.963 --> 00:27:13.765
THINK RECORDS THAT'S OVERDUE BUT

00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:15.834
IN THE END A SPECIFIC PROJECT IF

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.634
THEY'RE NOT THE TYPE OF PROJECT

00:27:16.701 --> 00:27:19.004
ENCOMPASSED BY NINE TWENTY TWO

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.405
AND THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE BUILDING

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:21.639
A BIKE LANE THROUGH THAT'S NOT

00:27:21.706 --> 00:27:23.475
ON THE EXISTING RIGHT AWAY THAT

00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:24.509
WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THE BILL

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:26.845
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S AN ACTIVE

00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:31.649
TRANSPORTATION. PLAN IN NUMBER

00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:34.285
THREE THE TERMS. IS TASK IS.

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:35.887
PROVIDE THE FROM THAT WE'VE- NO

00:27:35.954 --> 00:27:37.956
AND IT SAYS IT'S A- SO THAT

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:39.591
LOCAL. COULD BE. THE MTC IN THE

00:27:39.657 --> 00:27:42.827
BAY. OR COULD BE CITY AND CAL OF

00:27:42.894 --> 00:27:43.495
SAN FRAN. FOUR AND ALL THAT DOES

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:45.497
IS IT PROMOTE AND- TO CHOOSING.

00:27:45.563 --> 00:27:47.332
TO CHOOSE WALKING BIKING ROLLING

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:49.100
STOCK THROUGH CREATION OF A SAFE

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:51.036
OF. A FOR A COMFORTABLE A

00:27:51.102 --> 00:27:51.936
CONNECTION AND ACCESSIBLE

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:53.905
ROLLING. ARE WALKING ROLLING AND

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:57.809
BIKING NETWORK SO IF YOU HAVE.

00:27:57.876 --> 00:27:59.644

YOU HAVE MEANS SOME CITIES AND

00:28:00.745 --> 00:28:02.714
I'M- FROM FREMONT THEY HAVE A

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:05.050
BIKE. NETWORK RIGHT SO THAT

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:07.318
WOULD BE. THE IF THEY CAME IN

00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:09.554
AND SAID THIS IS NOW GOING TO BE

00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:10.555
OUR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN-

00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:11.856
THAT WHOLE THING ILL BE

00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:13.958
CORPORATE RIGHT WELL THREE. TO

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:17.195
BE CLEAR WENT UP LIKE THAT. SB

00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:18.496
TWENTY BUILT ON EXISTING ORDER

00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:20.899
ALREADY EXEMPTIONS FOR BIKE

ALREADY RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S SIX

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:30.909
THAT'S WHAT I GOT THIS THAT'S

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:32.811
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS WHAT'S

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:34.612
THAT. NEW STUFF THAT'S COMING IN

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:35.713
FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION OR

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.916
PEDESTRIAN PLANS. BECAUSE I KNOW

00:28:37.982 --> 00:28:40.018
THAT WE'RE THERE'S A WHOLE

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:41.953
SERIES OF THEM SUCH. A BAD IDEA

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.454
TO EIGHTY EIGHT ALREADY

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.822
EFFECTIVELY A CALL LIKE A

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.890
COMPASS TO ALL THAT I THINK WILL

00:28:45.957 --> 00:28:47.725
BE MORE SPECIFIC IN DEFINING IT.

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:50.128
IN THIS BILL SO IT'S TIGHTENING

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:52.564

INTEGRATED. THANK. YOU MISTER.

AREA AND I. TYPICALLY AGREE WITH

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:21.559
WHAT YOUR GOAL IS BUT- I'M I'M

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:23.328
HAVING A MAYBE A LITTLE.

00:29:23.394 --> 00:29:25.029
EXPANDED MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:26.898
ON WHAT. SENATOR WIENER WAS

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:28.766
TALKING ABOUT IS THAT YOU KNOW

00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:29.501
IT CAN BE ENVIRONMENT PROJECT

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:31.336
LOOK WITH THIS IS GOOD TO GET

00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:32.770
PEOPLE OFF OF THE- TO DO

00:29:32.837 --> 00:29:34.205
DIFFERENT CUT TYPES OF TRANSIT

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:35.573
WHERE WE CAN MOVE PEOPLE. IN A

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.108
MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:39.777
WAY BUT SEQUEL WAS. DEVELOPED

00:29:39.844 --> 00:29:42.180
FOR. TO MAKE SURE THAT IMPACTS

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:44.249
WERE MET SO SOME COMMUNITY GETS

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:45.717
IMPACT IN A DIFFERENT WAY YOU

00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:47.085
HAVE TO ADDRESS THOSE IMPACTS

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:49.454
AND SO. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THE-

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:52.590
WATERING DOWN OF SECRET FOR.

00:29:52.657 --> 00:29:55.093
CERTAIN CARVED OUT PROJECTS AND

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.828
TYPICALLY I HAVE SUPPORT OF

00:29:56.895 --> 00:29:58.596
THOSE BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO

00:29:58.663 --> 00:30:00.632
HAVE. MAYBE A- DEEPER

00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:02.367
CONVERSATION ABOUT SEQUEL AND

00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:04.068
NOT JUST IN THESE AREAS WHERE WE

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:08.139
HAVE- MAYBE IT'S MAYBE IT'S THE-

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:10.842
KINGS ARENA OR IT'S- SOME OTHER

00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:12.844
INFILL PROJECT THAT WE'RE TRYING

00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:17.081
TO. BASICALLY PROMOTE BUILDING

00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:18.550
THROUGH EASING OF REGULATIONS SO

00:30:18.616 --> 00:30:21.186
IN THIS CASE. THERE'S A%

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:22.854
STATEWIDE THIS ISN'T A CARVED

00:30:22.921 --> 00:30:24.956
OUT ONE PROJECT THIS IS FOR

00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:26.758
EVERY CITY THAT HAS A TRANSIT

00:30:26.824 --> 00:30:29.561
SYSTEM OR MAYBE A WERE ALLOWING

00:30:29.627 --> 00:30:31.529
SECRET EXEMPTIONS AND SO WHEN

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:34.032
THERE'S IMPACTS HOW DOES IMPACTS

00:30:34.098 --> 00:30:35.867
GET DEALT WITH UNDERNEATH THE

00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:37.435
LAW BECAUSE THERE IS NO NOW

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:39.237
YOU'RE EXEMPTING THOSE. YEAH SO

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:41.439
A COUPLE OF THINGS AND I WOULD

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:44.108
SAID I THINK THAT THE ARGUMENT-

00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:44.642
CENTER THAT YOU'RE MAKING

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.778
ACTUALLY. MEANS THAT THIS IS

00:30:46.844 --> 00:30:47.745
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD SUPPORT

00:30:47.812 --> 00:30:49.314
BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND I

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.882
UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION WHEN

00:30:50.949 --> 00:30:52.817
A SPECIFIC PROJECT GETS

00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:54.852
ACCELERATOR CARD THAT USE YOUR

00:30:54.919 --> 00:30:57.155
SPORTS ARENA- I YOU KNOW I'VE

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:59.224
I'VE SUPPORTED- THOSE BUT I

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.026
UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW I THOUGHT

00:31:02.093 --> 00:31:02.627
FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT WAY WHY ARE

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:04.963
WE STREAMLINING SPORTS ARENA BUT

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:07.065
NOT HOUSING AND WE CAN AND-

00:31:07.131 --> 00:31:08.399
THOSE ARE SUBJECT TO CRITICISM

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:10.168
WHATEVER ONE'S VIEW. THIS IS NOT

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:12.971
DOT THIS IS A STATWIDE POLICY

00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:14.272
THAT CITIES CAN AND TRANSIT

00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:16.841
AGENCIES CAN USE OR NOT USE THEY

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:18.843
DON'T HAVE TO EVER IN BOCA AND

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.411
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THIS IS

00:31:20.478 --> 00:31:22.280
DEMOCRACY BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:23.414
CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD OF

00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:25.950
SUPERVISORS OR TRANSIT BOARD CAN

00:31:26.017 --> 00:31:27.452
MAKE THEIR DECISION ABOUT WHAT

00:31:27.518 --> 00:31:29.320
THEY WANT TO DO. AND IF YOU HAVE

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:31.456
ONE NEIGHBOR WHO'S UPSET ABOUT

00:31:31.522 --> 00:31:32.890
IT AND THEN FILES A SEQUEL

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:34.225
LAWSUIT THERE ARE GONNA BE ABLE

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:36.661
TO DO THAT SO I THINK THIS IS A

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:37.996
THIS IS PROMOTING. DEMOCRACY AND

00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:39.397
ALLOW AND A CITY CAN IGNORE IT

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:41.232
SO WE DON'T WANNA PUT BIKE LANES

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:42.533
AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.236
BUS SERVICE IN THIS AREA THEY

00:31:45.303 --> 00:31:45.837
MAKE THAT DECISION UNDER THE

00:31:45.903 --> 00:31:48.072
BROWN ACT AND UNDER DEMOCRATIC

00:31:48.139 --> 00:31:50.208
PRINCIPLES SO YOU KNOW I LISTEN

00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:52.243
I WAS YOU KNOW I I'VE MADE

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.911
COMMENTS ON THE SENATE FLOOR IN

00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:54.746
RECENT WEEKS ABOUT. THAT THERE

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:57.081
ARE SOME STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES I

00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:58.216
THINK AND SEE WHAT IN THAT

00:31:58.283 --> 00:32:00.718
SEQUENCE TO BE MORE FOCUSED YOU

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:01.586
KNOW TO ALSO MAKE SURE IT'S

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:03.788
ALWAYS CONTEMPLATING CLIMATE

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:10.395
CHANGE- BY THE DOCTORS. AS YOU

00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:12.330
KNOW THAT IS A- THERE'S A BIG.

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:14.432
ISSUE AND IT AND IT'S CONTRA. ON

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:16.067
HOPEFULLY IT'LL HAPPEN SOME

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:16.701
POINT. BUT I DO. THAT THERE ARE

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:18.403
CERTAIN PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT

00:32:18.469 --> 00:32:19.003
ARE CURRENTLY ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.938
FRIENDLY IN THE CITY SHOULD BE

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:22.040
ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:24.042
WELL I 100% AGREE IN THOSE

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:24.776
DECISIONS TO BE MADE BUT SEEK

00:32:24.842 --> 00:32:26.811
WAS A STATEWIDE LAW. YEAH IT IS

00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:28.913
NOT IT IS NOT THE BOARD OF

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.515
SUPERVISORS OR- THE CITY COUNCIL

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:31.549
DOESN'T GET TO DETERMINE.

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:33.217
WHETHER C. BECAUSE IT IMPLIED OR

00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:35.153
NOT UNLESS WE ALLOW THEM THROUGH

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:37.021
LAW THROUGH LEGISLATION WHICH IS

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:37.889
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ATTEMPTING

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:40.725
TO DO RIGHT NOW. AND SO. I THINK

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:43.428
THE BGGER CONCERN IS THAT. IS

00:32:43.494 --> 00:32:44.696
THAT IS SEQUEL. REALLY

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:46.497
LEGITIMATE OR IS IT BEEN ABUSED

00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:47.765
AND I THINK THAT WE'VE TALKED

00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:49.600
ABOUT THE ABUSES OF SEQUEL- I

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:51.235
ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE WHAT I

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:52.603
THINK IS A GOOD LAW. BECAUSE IT

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.505
ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPACTED

00:32:54.572 --> 00:32:56.941
BY DEVELOPMENT TO BE. YEAH

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:59.344
MITIGATION AND TO BE MADE AT

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:01.012
LEAST SOMEWHAT HOLE. FOR THEIR

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:03.348
IMPACTS AND SO WE CONTINUE TO GO

00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:05.616
DOWN THE ROAD OF. CARVING OUT

00:33:05.683 --> 00:33:07.518
FOR THE THINGS WE CARE ABOUT OR

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:09.253
THE OR THE ABILITY TO GET A LAW

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.588
PASSED THROUGH THIS. THROUGH

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:12.690
THIS LEGISLATURE. I THINK WE

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:14.959
REALLY SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THE

00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:16.394
SEQUENCE ALL AND I KNOW YOUR SAY

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:17.895
WELL THAT DOESN'T TO PERTAIN TO

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:19.497
THIS BILL. IT DOES BECAUSE WE

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:21.165
JUST CONTINUE TO NOT HAVE THAT

00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:22.467
CONVERSATION ABOUT SEQUEL. AND

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:24.168
THAT ONE PERSON WITH THE-

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:26.204
ATTORNEY OR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.705
WITH ATTORNEY OR BUSINESS WITH

00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:29.073
AN ATTORNEY THAT WANTS TO SONST

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.110
SUIT AND STOP A PROJECT HE SAID

00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:33.144
THAT IN YOU'RE- ACTUALLY IN

00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:35.179
YOUR- THE- PRESENTATION OF YOUR

00:33:35.246 --> 00:33:37.749
BILL. SO THIS IS GONNA ALLOW

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:39.283
THAT ATTORNEY OR THAT LOCAL

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.586
GROUP NOT TO BE ABLE TO SUE IN

00:33:41.652 --> 00:33:42.754
THE SITUATIONS IN THE PROJECTS

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.355
ARE GOING TO GO FORWARD. SO IT'S

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:46.090
REALLY ADVERTING THE LAW. AND

00:33:46.157 --> 00:33:47.725
CARVING OUT SOMETHING FOR A

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:49.727
STATEWIDE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:51.329
SO THAT'S MY POINT IS THAT. WE

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:53.698
NEED TO HAVE A LONG WE NEED TO

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:54.799
HAVE A BIGGER DISCUSSION ABOUT.

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.701
SOME ONE ENTITY BEING ABLE TO

00:33:56.768 --> 00:33:58.736
STOP A PROJECT AND THAT'S QUITE

00:33:58.803 --> 00:34:00.304
FRANKLY NOT GOOD FOR THE

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:01.506
ENVIRONMENT IS NOT GOOD. AND

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:02.673
MAINLY IN HOUSING WE NEVER HEAR

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.342
WE NEVER HEAR AN EXEMPTION

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:05.376
BROWSING THEY CAN'T GET OUT OF

00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:08.179
HERE FOR SOME REASON WE NEVER

00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:09.647
HAVE ANY WE DID IT WE DID FOR

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:11.716
INFILL. HOTELS I DID FEDERAL SO

00:34:11.783 --> 00:34:13.284
THAT'S MY POINT IS THAT WE CAN

00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:14.352
CONTINUE TO. KICKED THE CAN DOWN

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:16.487
THE ROAD AND DO ONE OFFS AND NOT

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:18.356
YET LEAVES POWER FOR THE

00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:18.923
LEGISLATORS BUT IT DOESN'T

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.924
EMPOWER CALIFORNIA DRIVE THE

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:21.959
COST OF LIVING DOWN THERE. NICE

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:25.029
SO- RISK RESPECTFULLY ASK FIRST

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:27.465
OF ALL I I'M A BIG FAN OF NOT

00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:28.433
MAKING THE PERFECT THE ENEMY OF

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:30.535
THE GOOD. AND YES THERE A LOT OF

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:32.270
AREAS WHERE WE SHOULD DO

00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:33.738
STRUCTURAL I DON'T THINK. THAT

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:35.139
THE WHOLE SYSTEM THESE THREE

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:36.908
FAXES AND ARGUMENT AGAINST.

00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:39.076
MAKING INCREMENTAL PROGRESS IF

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:40.578
WE CAN DO THAT'S MY PERSONAL

00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:42.914
PERSPECTIVE- TERMS OF HOUSING WE

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.782
HAVE STREAMLINED. HOUSING THIS

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:46.284
COMMITTEE IS TYPICALLY THE THIRD

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.719
REFERRAL AND THE SENATE HAS NOT

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:51.322
BEEN HAVING HEARINGS IN THE

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.989
THIRD COMMITTEE BUT- SEVENTY TWO

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:53.124
COMMITTEE PROVIDES FEEDBACK

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:54.192
BECAUSE TYPICALLY TO HOUSING

00:34:54.258 --> 00:34:55.560
COMMITTEE. AND GOVERNANCE AND

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:57.829
FINANCE- STREAMLINING BILLS AND

00:34:57.895 --> 00:35:00.598
WE PASSED. LAST YEAR SENATE BILL

00:35:00.665 --> 00:35:02.733
NINE THAT WAS A- THAT CONTAINS

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.501
SICK WITH STREAMLINING BECAUSE

00:35:03.568 --> 00:35:05.269
WERE FAVORING ONE DUPLEXES TO BE

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:07.605
BUILT- SO I UNDERSTAND. YOUR

00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:09.607
CONCERN BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:14.312
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A STOP-

00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:16.948
AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP. AN

00:35:17.014 --> 00:35:19.917
NHS. WE JUST OF THE CONVERSATION

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:22.086
. YOU KNOW WHAT PROJECT THIS IS

00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:24.021
NOT AN APPLES TO APPLES

00:35:24.088 --> 00:35:25.957
COMPARISON- YOU KNOW. WE

00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:27.859
BUILDING A MASSIVE MANUFACTURING

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:30.695
PLANT. NEXT TO IT A SCHOOL IS

00:35:30.761 --> 00:35:32.163
VERY DIFFERENT THAN BUILDING A

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.831
BIKE A BIKE LANE THE GOOD LOOK

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:35.366
STRIPING ST FOR BIKE LANES OR OR

00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:38.035
OR A OF YOU KNOW- BUT WALKING

00:35:38.102 --> 00:35:39.237
INFRASTRUCTURE A MASS TRANSIT

00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:41.105
LINE I MEAN THESE ARE THINGS

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:41.639
THAT ARE SO UNEQUIVOCALLY

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:44.075
BENEFICIAL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT-

00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:45.877
THEY THEY I THINK THEY MERIT A

00:35:45.943 --> 00:35:46.878
DIFFERENT TREATMENT UNDER THE

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:47.678
SENATE COULD UNDER THE

00:35:47.745 --> 00:35:48.679
CALIFORNIA VINYL QUALITY ACT

00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:50.348
THAT'S MY- ATTITUDE THAT HAS TO

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:52.617
DO WITH THE TYPE OF PROJECT IN

00:35:52.683 --> 00:35:53.718
THE TYPE OF. BENEFIT THAT IT

00:35:53.784 --> 00:35:55.720
BRINGS TO SOCIETY AND TO OUR

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:57.154
ENVIRONMENT OR NOT. ALL RIGHT SO

00:35:57.221 --> 00:35:59.490
I JUST PUT I JUST PUT THE TYPES

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:00.992
OF PROJECTS THAT ARE AGAIN

00:36:01.058 --> 00:36:01.592
CONSIDERED UNDER UNDER SEQUIN

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:03.094
UNDER VERY DIFFERENT AND

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.096
CATEGORIES FOR CONSIDERATION AS

00:36:05.162 --> 00:36:06.998
THE MASS TRANSIT IS A IN IN BEEN

00:36:07.064 --> 00:36:07.899
BEEN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION IS

00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:11.802
JUST A VERY DIFFERENT WHEN IT

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:13.204
COMES OF OUR MENTAL. BENEFITS

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:20.645
SENATOR. THANK YOU MR- IN AND I

00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:23.114
WILL SAY THE OTHER THING IS WITH

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:23.714
EXCEPTIONALLY ONE BILL EVERY

00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:25.283
HOUSING BILL THAT'S BEEN HEARD

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:26.517
THIS COMMITTEE ON SEA QUEST IS

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:29.186
GONNA COMMITTEE. SO THEY DO NOT

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:32.223
DIE IN HERE. OKAY SO MY

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:35.526
QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO TWO

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:39.497
FACTORS- ONE IS HOW TO MAKE SURE

00:36:39.564 --> 00:36:42.500
WE'RE GETTING GOOD. FOR LACK OF

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:43.935
BETTER WORD CROWDSOURCING OR

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:46.170
COMMUNITY INPUT ON THESE ACTIVE

00:36:46.237 --> 00:36:47.438
TRANSPORTATION PLANS ARE

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:50.741
PEDESTRIAN PLANS AND I WANTED TO

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:52.076
OFFER MAYBE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE

00:36:52.143 --> 00:36:54.111
AND JUST SEE HOW THE BILL MIGHT

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.546
APPLY OR MAYBE EVEN HOW THE

00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:57.348
IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES MIGHT BE.

00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:59.517
APPROACHING IT TO SORT OF GET A

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:02.119
BETTER SENSE IN MY EXPERIENCE

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:04.255
WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT A REALLY GOOD

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:07.058
OUTCOMES FOR PROJECTS- THAT SAY

00:37:07.124 --> 00:37:08.926
THE ENGINEERS AT DEPARTMENT

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:09.660
TRANSPORTATION OR CALTRANS FOR

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:11.996
PLANTING THE MEAT OUT OF THIS

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:14.966
REALLY APPROACH- PURSUITS ATP

00:37:15.032 --> 00:37:16.467
GOALS ARE V. M. T. REDUCTION

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.636
GOALS ARE GHG REDUCTION GOALS.

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:22.206
BUT- BUT WHEN WE KIND OF GOT

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:24.108
THAT OUT IN THE PUBLIC SPACE

00:37:24.175 --> 00:37:26.177
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO REALIZE

00:37:26.243 --> 00:37:27.445
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT SORT OF

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:29.013
INTUITIVELY THE COMMUNITY

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:29.513
UNDERSTOOD THE MAYBE THE

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.549
ENGINEERS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. SO

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:33.217
EXAMPLE IS THE STREET OVER

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:35.119
CROSSING IN THE SAN FERNANDO

00:37:35.186 --> 00:37:35.720
VALLEY GOING TO BE TORN DOWN

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:37.655
BECAUSE IT WAS SAGGING IN GOING

00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:39.690
TO HIT THE FREEWAY AND SO IS OUT

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:41.058
OF COMPLIANCE WITH SAFETY

00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:42.393
REQUIREMENTS. CALTRANS IS GOING

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.895
TO- JUST TEAR DOWN THE

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:47.865
PEDESTRIAN OVER CROSSING AND-

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:50.468
HADN'T BUILT INTO THAT PROJECT.

00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:52.470
WHAT THIS SORT OF COROLLARY.

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:54.972
WALKING BIKING ACCESS ISSUES

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:56.540
TURNS OUT. TWO BLOCKS AWAY

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:58.275
THERE'S ANOTHER- BRIDGE THAT

00:37:58.342 --> 00:37:59.910
COULD BE UTILIZED BUT WE COULD

00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:01.679
MAYBE TAKE SOME. SHOP FUNDS

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:02.947
RATHER EIGHTY P. FUNDS IN SORT

00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:05.182
OF UPGRADE. THAT NEIGHBORING

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:06.984
STREET AND SORT OF GET BETTER

00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:08.753
OUTCOMES MAYBE ON BOTH FRONTS.

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:12.657
THAT ALL CAME OUT THROUGH THE- I

00:38:12.723 --> 00:38:13.958
GUESS THROUGH THE SEQUEL PROCESS

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:15.626
REALLY AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:16.994
BECAUSE IT WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:19.597
IMPACT WAS EVALUATED PER SE. BUT

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:21.899
MORE OF A THROUGH THAT NOTICE

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:24.535
PROCESS NOT- THOSE COMMENTS WILL

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:27.338
BE ABLE TO BE ACCEPTED- AND WE

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:29.407
WERE ABLE TO FIND SORT OF. MORE

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:32.910
CREATIVE- YOU KNOW THE MORE

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:33.744
PROGRESSIVE OUTCOMES SO I'M

00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:37.014
WONDERING. I KNOW METROS ONE OF

00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:38.315
THE SPONSORS. I DON'T THINK THIS

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:39.383
IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.018
THOSE ARE MORE CALTRANS PROJECTS

00:38:41.085 --> 00:38:42.553
AS PEDESTRIAN OVER CROSSING

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.389
PROJECTS BUT- TRYING TO GET A

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:47.124
SENSE FOR HOW. ON THE GROUND

00:38:47.191 --> 00:38:48.325
IMPLEMENTATION WOULD WORK IN

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:52.029
THAT KIND OF CASE CONSUMIR THIS

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:53.197
. THIS BILL DOES NOT TAKE AWAY

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:55.099
THE ABILITY TO HOLD COMMUNITY

00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:56.400
MEETINGS AND SOGDIAN EXAMPLE

00:38:56.467 --> 00:38:57.635
WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF

00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:59.870
SUPERVISORS IN SAN FRANCISCO WE

00:38:59.937 --> 00:39:01.005
DID. SOME MAJOR FLIGHT UPGRADES

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:03.340
AND PART OF. A PART PARTS OF A

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:04.709
DISTURBING ACCOUNT CUSTOMER

00:39:04.775 --> 00:39:06.410
MARKET AREA IN GLEN PARK IN SOME

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.112
OTHER AREAS. WE WERE NOT

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:10.147
REQUIRED TO HOLD COMMUNITIES

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:11.449
SEEK WITH THE NOT REQUIRED AT

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:13.784
ALL. WE HELD COMMUNITY MEETINGS

00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:15.419
A COMMUNITY THREATS TO GET

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:17.054
BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE. THE GOOD

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:18.856
THING AND RIGHT THING TO DO WHEN

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:21.292
YOU'RE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND

00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:22.727
YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:24.528
GOING OUT AND PUT THAT OUT THERE

00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:25.763
WITHOUT TALKING TO MY

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:26.664
CONSTITUENTS AND GETTING. THEIR

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:30.034
FEEDBACK. HI AND I AGREE HAVING

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:31.335
THOSE MEETINGS WHEN YOU'RE A

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:32.970
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS IMPORTANT

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.238
AND IF YOU'RE CITY COUNCIL

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:36.006
MEMBERS- LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE

00:39:36.073 --> 00:39:37.541
LIKE NOT ENGAGING WITH THE

00:39:37.608 --> 00:39:38.375
PUBLIC. THEY SHOULD BE THROWN

00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:40.111
OUT OF OFFICE THAT'S DEMOCRACY

00:39:40.177 --> 00:39:41.712
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DOING THEIR

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:43.180
JOBS- BUT WHEN YOU BRING

00:39:43.247 --> 00:39:44.915
SEQUENCES IT DOESN'T REQUIRE

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:46.851
COMMUNITY MEETINGS. BUT WHAT IT

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:48.919
DOES DO IS IT ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:49.720
ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE TO

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:52.256
COMMUNITY. TO DELAY OR KILL YOUR

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:54.759
PROJECTS WE RESULT IN SAN

00:39:54.825 --> 00:39:56.393
FRANCISCO WHERE OUR BIKE PLAN.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.129
GOT SUED UNDERSEA QUOTE NOT FOR

00:39:58.195 --> 00:40:00.164
ANY ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS BUT

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:01.132
FOR THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE

00:40:01.198 --> 00:40:02.833
DON'T WANT TO PROMOTE BIKING I

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.468
GOT HELD UP AND THAT'S ONE OF

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:06.470
THE THINGS THAT CREATED THE

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:07.037
SEQUEL EXEMPTION. FOR BIKE

00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:10.541
LANES- AND SO I YOU KNOW I THINK

00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:12.443
WE NEED TO YOU KNOW. FOCUS ON

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.778
LIKE HAVING GOOD LOCAL

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:17.014
DEMOCRACY. AND YOU CAN NOTHING

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:17.948
SICKLE REQUIRES COMMUNITY

00:40:18.015 --> 00:40:19.817
MEETINGS AND NOTHING THIS WILL

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:21.285
NOT TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY TO

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:22.753
HAVE COMMUNITIES REQUIRES A FOR

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.956
LARGER PROJECTS- BUT OF COURSE.

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:27.458
LOCAL OFFICIALS SHOULD ALWAYS BE

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:29.760
ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY AS A

00:40:29.827 --> 00:40:30.594
MATTER OF BASIC DEMOCRACY THEY

00:40:30.661 --> 00:40:32.897
SHOULD BE THROWN OUT OF OFFICE

00:40:32.963 --> 00:40:33.531
WHO CAN I ASK I DON'T KNOW IF

00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:35.432

00:43:47.591 --> 00:43:49.159
THAT KIND OF CONSENSUS BUILDING

00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:50.894
THAT'SONE OF THE FACTORS THAT

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.396
LEADS TO LAWSUITS UNDER CEQA

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.665
WRIT THAT WITHOUT ANY RECOURSE

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:55.833
FOR A LAWSUIT UNDER SEEK WITH.

00:43:55.899 --> 00:43:57.568
AND WITHOUT ANY HARD REQUIREMENT

00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:59.803
THAT YOU HAVE THAT INTERFACE

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.939
INTERIOR AGENCY COULD CONSTRUCT

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:03.707
A YOU KNOW A NINETY NINE MILLION

00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:06.643
DOLLAR PROJECT AND NOT HAVE ANY

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:07.778
COMMUNITY MEETINGS OR TAKE ANY

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:13.484
PUBLIC. INPUT IS NOT RIGHT UNDER

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.952
THE BILL. IN THEORY CORRECT

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:15.853
YEAH. BUT SOME COULD STILL

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:17.755
THROUGH FOR UNDER THE- UNDER THE

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:18.722
SEAT FROM XIN. IT WOULDN'T BE

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:21.191
BAY ON CERTAIN ON THE OUT. BUT

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:23.293
RIGHT BUT JUST AS A MATTER OF

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.095
ROSS SAYS HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:28.098
WRITE IF I. ADD THAT. YOU KNOW I

00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:30.300
THINK. IF IT'S GOING TO BE

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:31.635
EXCEPTION NOT THE RULE THAT

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:32.703
THEY'RE GOING TO CONFRONT THE

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:34.538
RATE WE'RE NOT TALKING TO

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:35.572
ANYONE. RIGHT THERE MIGHT COULD

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:37.841
THERE BE A RANDOM CITY WITH WITH

00:44:37.908 --> 00:44:39.543
THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE DUBBED

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.478
THE SURE YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE.

00:44:41.545 --> 00:44:42.780
BAD LOCAL OFFICIALS BUT IN MY

00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:44.848
EXPERIENCE THAT THAT DOESN'T

00:44:44.915 --> 00:44:46.250
HAPPEN THERE'S THERE THERE IS

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:47.618
ENGAGEMENT. BUT AGAIN THE

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:49.953
DOWNSIDE OF NOT HAVING THE

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.355
EXEMPTION IS YOU HAVE A PROJECT

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:53.357
WE'VE ALL SEEN THIS WERE 90% THE

00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:55.559
COMMUNITY LOVES. IT'S LIKE

00:44:55.626 --> 00:44:58.128
BROADLY EMBRACED AND ACCEPTED.

00:44:58.195 --> 00:44:59.863
BUT THAT ONE NEIGHBOR WHOSE VIEW

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.098
IS BEING BLOCKED BY THE

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:03.133
PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE OR WHATEVER

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.868
AND HAS ENOUGH MONEY TO HIRE A

00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:06.370
LAWYER SUITS AND TIES IT UP FOR

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:07.504
YEARS AND WE'VE ALL SEEN THAT

00:45:07.571 --> 00:45:09.239
HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOT

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:10.541
JUST ON THIS KIND OF ISSUE BUT

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:12.576
OTHERS WELL. AND SO IT'S

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:13.677
ALWAYS A TRADE OFF. ALWAYS A

00:45:13.744 --> 00:45:15.546
TRADE OFF AND I DO THINK THAT

00:45:15.612 --> 00:45:18.115
OVERWHELMINGLY- LOCAL.

00:45:18.182 --> 00:45:19.950
GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO TRY TO

00:45:20.017 --> 00:45:21.018
ENGAGE THE COMMUNITIES THEY

00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:22.486
DON'T WANT TO HAVE. PEOPLE COME

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:23.821

PROJECTS REGARDLESS OF SIZE SOME

00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:45.776
KIND OF- NOTICE OBLIGATION- IT

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:49.179

EXACTLY THE PROCESS YOU YOU LAID

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:52.683

A WEALTHIER COMMUNITY EXTORT

00:47:13.964 --> 00:47:17.668

HIGH HYDROGEN STATION OR

ALWAYS GONNA BE THERE AROUND

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.287
THIS BILL IS THAT THIS IS GOING

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:21.423

02:20:41.432 --> 02:20:44.435
WATER SYSTEMS SERVE AN ESTIMATED

02:20:44.502 --> 02:20:44.903
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:20:44.969 --> 02:20:45.670
CALIFORNIA'S SHOULD HAVE A

02:20:45.737 --> 02:20:46.971
MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:20:47.038 --> 02:20:49.974
THAT ARE NOT BEING TAKEN CARE OF

02:20:50.041 --> 02:20:51.376
AT ANY GIVEN TIME. RECOGNIZING

02:20:51.442 --> 02:20:53.178
THE EXTENT OF THIS ISSUE. AND

02:20:53.244 --> 02:20:55.213
THE SMALL SYSTEMS LACK OF THE

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:56.514
TECHNICAL MANAGERIAL AND

02:20:56.581 --> 02:20:57.549
FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO

02:20:57.615 --> 02:21:00.218
EFFECTIVELY MANAGE. OPERATIONS

02:21:00.285 --> 02:21:03.254
AT THE AS I SUGGESTED WHAT WE

02:21:03.321 --> 02:21:04.322
DID IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IS

02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:05.790
WE GRANTED TOGETHER WITH THE

02:21:05.857 --> 02:21:06.658
GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE THE STATE

02:21:06.724 --> 02:21:08.126
WATER CONTROL BOARD THE BILL TO

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:09.360
APPOINT. THIRD PARTY

02:21:09.427 --> 02:21:11.229
ADMINISTRATORS TO ASSIST. IN

02:21:11.296 --> 02:21:13.331
THOSE FAILING SYSTEMS. BUT THE

02:21:13.398 --> 02:21:14.666
REALITY IS I SUGGESTED IS THE

02:21:14.732 --> 02:21:16.935
TOOL HAS NOT BEEN WORKING AS

02:21:17.001 --> 02:21:18.036
WELL AS IT SHOULD HAVE OF THE

02:21:18.102 --> 02:21:18.736
THIRTEEN WATER SYSTEMS ARE

02:21:18.803 --> 02:21:23.241
ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE.

02:21:23.308 --> 02:21:24.342
ADMINISTRATORS ONLY ONE. ONE HAS

02:21:24.409 --> 02:21:26.711
APPOINTED. A ONE TO DATE. S.

02:21:26.778 --> 02:21:28.313
ARE. SO BASED WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:21:28.379 --> 02:21:30.348
IS THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SEEING

02:21:30.415 --> 02:21:32.517
WILLING AND PROMISING CANDIDATES

02:21:32.584 --> 02:21:34.619
CITE A LACK OF CLARITY AROUND

02:21:34.686 --> 02:21:35.753
THE STATUTORY LIABILITY. AS A

02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:37.355
KEY REASON FOR THEIR RELUCTANCE

02:21:37.422 --> 02:21:39.257
TO ACCEPT. ADMINISTRATORS

02:21:39.324 --> 02:21:40.658
RESPONSES MINISTRY

02:21:40.725 --> 02:21:43.394
RESPONSIBILITY. THIS IS HAD AS I

02:21:43.461 --> 02:21:44.963
SAID A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE

02:21:45.029 --> 02:21:46.397
SUCCESS OF THE WATER BOARD

02:21:46.464 --> 02:21:47.599
ADMINISTRATOR PROGRAM. SO WHAT

02:21:47.665 --> 02:21:49.567
WE'VE DONE TODAY IS TO SET UP A

02:21:49.634 --> 02:21:51.469
FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE A BY BILL

02:21:51.536 --> 02:21:52.537
PROTECTION TO ADMINISTRATORS

02:21:52.604 --> 02:21:54.873
WERE WORKING GOOD FAITH WITH

02:21:54.939 --> 02:21:57.275
WITH REASONABLE EFFORTS. SO WE

02:21:57.342 --> 02:21:58.509
CAN START REFORMING OUR FIELD

02:21:58.576 --> 02:22:01.212
WHAT SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION THIS

02:22:01.279 --> 02:22:03.047
MEASURE ALSO EXPANDS THE

02:22:03.114 --> 02:22:04.582
APPOINTMENT AUTHORITY OF

02:22:04.649 --> 02:22:07.485
ADMINISTRATORS TO DEAL WITH AT

02:22:07.552 --> 02:22:08.486
RISK SYSTEMS WE DON'T WANT JUST

02:22:08.553 --> 02:22:10.622
SYSTEMS FAILED. IF SOMETHING'S

02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:12.624
AT RISK WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE

02:22:12.690 --> 02:22:14.392
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT IT AND GET

02:22:14.459 --> 02:22:17.128
AHEAD OF THE PROBLEM. SO YOU

02:22:17.195 --> 02:22:19.898
KNOW IS A SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL

02:22:19.964 --> 02:22:20.632
SIX HUNDRED WATER SYSTEMS ARE

02:22:20.698 --> 02:22:23.067
CURRENTLY AT RISK FOR FAILING

02:22:23.134 --> 02:22:24.702
SIX HUNDRED AND APPROX ME FORTY

02:22:24.769 --> 02:22:26.271
SEVEN NEW WATER SYSTEMS ADDED TO

IN THE US AND I THINK ALL OF US

02:53:12.548 --> 02:53:15.284
REALIZE THAT WE- THE MAN IS

02:53:15.351 --> 02:53:19.589
ESSENTIAL TO. WE LOOK AT THE NEW

02:53:19.655 --> 02:53:21.657
FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING.

02:53:21.724 --> 02:53:23.493
MUCH OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WORK

02:53:23.559 --> 02:53:25.762
IS GONNA NEED CEMENT WE KNOW

02:53:25.828 --> 02:53:28.097
THAT OUR HOUSING COMMITMENTS ARE

02:53:28.164 --> 02:53:32.101
GOING TO NEED CEMENT AND WE FROM

02:53:32.168 --> 02:53:34.704
MY POINT OF VIEW WE WANT TO KEEP

02:53:34.771 --> 02:53:36.873
THE CEMENT INDUSTRY HERE AND THE

02:53:36.939 --> 02:53:39.008
REASON WE WANT TO KEEP IT HERE

02:53:39.075 --> 02:53:40.877
THE CEMENT PRODUCED ELSEWHERE.

02:53:40.943 --> 02:53:44.514
IS SO MUCH HIGHER CARBON AND SO

02:53:44.580 --> 02:53:47.049
MUCH MORE POLLUTING IN THOSE IN

02:53:47.116 --> 02:53:50.353
THE LOCAL AREA FOR WHERE IT'S-

02:53:50.419 --> 02:53:53.189
FIVE- PRODUCED THAT WE HAVE A

02:53:53.256 --> 02:53:54.457
RESPONSIBILITY TO PRODUCE THE

02:53:54.524 --> 02:53:57.426
MATERIALS THAT WE NEED. A HAND

02:53:57.493 --> 02:53:58.761
TO DO THOSE IN AS

02:53:58.828 --> 02:54:00.830
ENVIRONMENTALLY SMART WAYS

02:54:00.897 --> 02:54:02.865
POSSIBLE THE LAST YEAR SENATOR

02:54:02.932 --> 02:54:05.134
BECKER CARRIED A BILL THAT WAS

02:54:05.201 --> 02:54:06.803
SUCCESSFUL THAT WAS SIGNED INTO

02:54:06.869 --> 02:54:08.070
LAW THE PUT NEW REQUIREMENTS ON

02:54:08.137 --> 02:54:09.739
THE DECARBONISATION OF THIS

02:54:09.806 --> 02:54:11.908
MINISTRY. AND CEMENT IS UNIQUE

02:54:11.974 --> 02:54:13.676
PRODUCT BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS

02:54:13.743 --> 02:54:15.645
THERE A LOT OF CARBON INVOLVED

02:54:15.711 --> 02:54:17.480
IN THE HIGH IT'S A VERY ENERGY

02:54:17.547 --> 02:54:19.649
INTENSIVE BUT THERE'S ALSO

02:54:19.715 --> 02:54:21.384
CARBON IS A BY PRODUCT AS PART

02:54:21.450 --> 02:54:22.819
OF ITS PROCESSING IT'S JUST THE

02:54:22.885 --> 02:54:25.054
NATURE OF IT. AND SO IT'S

02:54:25.121 --> 02:54:27.623
DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE CEMENT

02:54:27.690 --> 02:54:29.759
BUT IT'S ESSENTIAL. SO WHAT MY

02:54:29.826 --> 02:54:33.763
BILL DOES IS IGNORE ALLEGE THAT

02:54:33.830 --> 02:54:36.265
. IN A TERMS OF A WHEN WE LOOK

02:54:36.332 --> 02:54:38.267
AT THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND YET

02:54:38.334 --> 02:54:40.203
WE'RE STILL NEED MATERIALS THAT

02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:42.705
HAVE CARBON ASSOCIATED HOW DO WE

02:54:42.772 --> 02:54:44.807
DO THAT AS SMART AS POSSIBLE

02:54:44.874 --> 02:54:48.177
WELL IN THIS IN THIS CASE

02:54:48.244 --> 02:54:50.646
CAPTURING THE CARBON. AND THEN

02:54:50.713 --> 02:54:53.249
ALLOWING US TO STORAGE. IS ONE

02:54:53.316 --> 02:54:56.619
WAY TO DECARBONISE CEMENT SO

02:54:56.686 --> 02:54:59.088
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CREATE A

02:54:59.155 --> 02:55:02.692
PILOT PROJECT FOR. THAT WOULD

02:55:02.758 --> 02:55:04.760
ALLOW US TO TEST THE VIABILITY

02:55:04.827 --> 02:55:05.928
OF UNDERGROUND STORAGE OF

02:55:05.995 --> 02:55:09.298
CARPETING CARBON. AND BY

02:55:09.365 --> 02:55:11.267
ALLOWING US TO CAPTURE CARBON

02:55:11.334 --> 02:55:14.237
FROM INDUSTRIAL PROCESS. FIVE

02:55:14.303 --> 02:55:16.639
THE I'VE BUT THE BILL WAS BUILT

02:55:16.706 --> 02:55:19.709
IN VARIOUS PROTECTIONS TO HELP

02:55:19.775 --> 02:55:21.878
ANY COMMUNITIES THAT MAY BE

02:55:21.944 --> 02:55:24.547
DOWNWIND OF- THE CEMENT

02:55:24.614 --> 02:55:27.149
PRODUCTION IT ALSO LIMITS THE

02:55:27.216 --> 02:55:27.650
CARBON FROM FOSSIL FUEL

02:55:27.717 --> 02:55:30.486
PRODUCTION. FIVE RELATED TO IT

02:55:30.553 --> 02:55:32.255
AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS BUT LET

02:55:32.321 --> 02:55:34.023
ME TURN MY WITNESSES NOW I'VE

02:55:34.090 --> 02:55:35.524
GOT DOCTOR REBEKAH DEL FROM

02:55:35.591 --> 02:55:37.994
CLIMATE WORKS AND ELLIE CONE

02:55:38.060 --> 02:55:40.863
FROM THE CLIMATE CENTER. GREAT

02:55:40.930 --> 02:55:49.605
LET'S START WITH AMERICA. HELLO

02:55:49.672 --> 02:55:52.008
UP I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE

02:55:52.074 --> 02:55:53.643
FOR THE THEIR WORK ON BEHALF OF

02:55:53.709 --> 02:55:55.244
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR

02:55:55.311 --> 02:55:57.413
THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE

02:55:57.480 --> 02:55:59.949
YOU TODAY TO TALK ABOUT SB NINE

02:56:00.016 --> 02:56:03.586
ZERO FIVE- I LEAVE THE LARGEST

02:56:03.653 --> 02:56:05.488
NONPROFIT PROGRAM TO ELIMINATE

02:56:05.554 --> 02:56:07.556
GREENHOUSE GASES FROM THE

02:56:07.623 --> 02:56:09.158
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. IN THE WORLD

02:56:09.225 --> 02:56:11.627
. AND I THINK THIS IS A REALLY

02:56:11.694 --> 02:56:12.895
IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

02:56:12.962 --> 02:56:15.998
LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA PASSED SB

02:56:16.065 --> 02:56:16.599
FIVE NINETY SIX COMMITTING THE

02:56:16.666 --> 02:56:18.501
STATE TO ZERO OUT ITS CEMENT

02:56:18.567 --> 02:56:20.269
EMISSIONS BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE.

02:56:20.336 --> 02:56:21.470
MINUTES THE LARGEST SOURCE OF

02:56:21.537 --> 02:56:22.672
MANUFACTURING EMISSIONS IN THE

02:56:22.738 --> 02:56:25.074
STATE WITH BETWEEN TWO AND 3% OF

02:56:25.141 --> 02:56:27.443
TOTAL STATE EMISSIONS IT'S ALSO

02:56:27.510 --> 02:56:29.478
7% OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS

02:56:29.545 --> 02:56:31.514
EMISSIONS. OF CALIFORNIA CAN

02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:33.883
DEMONSTRATE THE TECHNICAL POLICY

02:56:33.950 --> 02:56:36.218
AND BUSINESS FEASIBILITY OF GHG

02:56:36.285 --> 02:56:38.888
FREE CEMENT THAT CAN HAVE A MUCH

02:56:38.955 --> 02:56:40.589
GREATER IMPACT AROUND THE WORLD.

02:56:40.656 --> 02:56:42.058
AND NO ONE HAS FIGURED THIS OUT

02:56:42.124 --> 02:56:43.659
YET SO CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP

02:56:43.726 --> 02:56:46.629
IS BADLY NEEDED. US CEMENT IS

02:56:46.696 --> 02:56:48.364
THE SECTOR WITH THE CLEAREST

02:56:48.431 --> 02:56:50.333
CASE FOR RELYING ON CARBON

02:56:50.399 --> 02:56:51.867
CAPTURE AND STORAGE TO REDUCE

02:56:51.934 --> 02:56:54.437
EMISSIONS SO IF WE WANT TO START

02:56:54.503 --> 02:56:56.372
TO EXPLORE CCS AS A PATHWAY TO

02:56:56.439 --> 02:56:58.607
CLIMATE ACTION. CEMENT IS THE

02:56:58.674 --> 02:57:01.877
CORRECT NO REGRETS PLACE TO

02:57:01.944 --> 02:57:03.612
START. THE MAN IS ALSO CRITICAL

02:57:03.679 --> 02:57:05.414
BECAUSE AS SENATOR SKINNER SAID

02:57:05.481 --> 02:57:06.816
ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS

02:57:06.882 --> 02:57:08.818
ACROSS OUR ECONOMY WILL REQUIRE

02:57:08.884 --> 02:57:09.986
THAT WE BUILD AN ENORMOUS

02:57:10.052 --> 02:57:11.887
AMOUNT. OF NEW TRANSPORTATION

02:57:11.954 --> 02:57:14.056
AND ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND IF

02:57:14.123 --> 02:57:15.624
WE CONTINUE TO USE CONVENTIONAL

02:57:15.691 --> 02:57:17.793
CEMENT OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE

02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:19.862
CLIMATE DAMAGE COULD THEMSELVES

02:57:19.929 --> 02:57:23.165
BECOME DRIVERS OF CLIMATE DAMAGE

02:57:23.232 --> 02:57:25.968
. AND FINALLY ADDRESSING US

02:57:26.035 --> 02:57:27.937
CLIMATE DAMAGE FROM CEMENT WILL

02:57:28.004 --> 02:57:29.405
ALSO HELP US TO ADDRESS ITS

02:57:29.472 --> 02:57:30.840
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS

02:57:30.906 --> 02:57:32.708
CALIFORNIA'S CEMENT KILNS ARE

02:57:32.775 --> 02:57:34.710
THE ONLY FACILITIES REMAINING IN

02:57:34.777 --> 02:57:36.812
THE STATE THAT STILL RELY ON

02:57:36.879 --> 02:57:38.848
DIRECT COAL BURNING. FOR THEIR

02:57:38.914 --> 02:57:41.684
ENERGY. THEY HAVE SOME OF THE

02:57:41.751 --> 02:57:43.586
HIGHEST RATES OF SOX EMISSIONS A

02:57:43.652 --> 02:57:45.721
CRITICAL LOCAL AIR POLLUTANT AND

02:57:45.788 --> 02:57:47.523
THAT THE IMPACT OF THIS

02:57:47.590 --> 02:57:47.890
POLLUTION FALLS

02:57:47.957 --> 02:57:49.892
DISPROPORTIONATELY ON LOW INCOME

02:57:49.959 --> 02:57:50.960
COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF

02:57:51.027 --> 02:57:53.129
COLOR. CAPTURING THE CARBON WILL

02:57:53.195 --> 02:57:55.464
ALSO REQUIRE US TO ELIMINATE

02:57:55.531 --> 02:57:57.199
THESE LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS AND

02:57:57.266 --> 02:57:59.301

FEW TO STORM THE GEOLOGIC

03:08:45.547 --> 03:08:49.685
STORAGE RESERVOIR- OUR OUR SORT

03:08:49.751 --> 03:08:53.021
OF WRAPPED UP IN THE ITLE- I

03:08:53.088 --> 03:08:55.424
LIKE THE FINAL COROLLARY THAT

03:08:55.490 --> 03:08:57.993
INCLUDES THE LIABILITY FOR AND

03:08:58.060 --> 03:08:59.828
ANY AND ALL DAMAGES CAUSED BY.

03:08:59.895 --> 03:09:01.596
ANOTHER WORDS IF YOU HAVE A

03:09:01.663 --> 03:09:03.031
RELEASE FROM A PROJECT OF THAT

03:09:03.098 --> 03:09:04.466
CEILING FORMATION DOESN'T WORK

03:09:04.533 --> 03:09:05.634
FOR WHATEVER REASON WHAT

03:09:05.701 --> 03:09:06.635
RECOURSE DO WE HAVE UNDER OUR

03:09:06.702 --> 03:09:10.238
GREENHOUSE GAS PROGRAM- AND IN

03:09:10.305 --> 03:09:11.273
THE PAST SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES

03:09:11.339 --> 03:09:12.741
THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED AND

03:09:12.808 --> 03:09:14.342
PERHAPS EVEN YOUR SPONSOR THE

03:09:14.409 --> 03:09:16.411
CLIMATE WORKS FOLKS MAY KNOW BUT

03:09:16.478 --> 03:09:18.113
THERE'S BEEN THAT THE IDEA OF A

03:09:18.180 --> 03:09:19.648
OF A TRUST OR SOME KIND OF

03:09:19.715 --> 03:09:20.415
INSURANCE MECHANISM. THAT

03:09:20.482 --> 03:09:21.583
THERE'S A BUFFER ACCOUNT IF YOU

03:09:21.650 --> 03:09:23.452
WILL IN CASE OF ANY RELEASE

03:09:23.518 --> 03:09:25.320
YOU'RE NOT SORT OF FORCED INTO A

03:09:25.387 --> 03:09:28.023
LITIGATION STANCE IF THINGS GO

03:09:28.090 --> 03:09:29.491
WITH OF WRONG WITH THE PROJECT

03:09:29.558 --> 03:09:31.426
BUT THAT THERE'S SORT OF A BUILT

03:09:31.493 --> 03:09:33.962
IN UP FRONT. EITHER BOND OR SOME

03:09:34.029 --> 03:09:35.630
KIND OF REQUIREMENT I THINK A

03:09:35.697 --> 03:09:37.666
LOT OF YOU'VE LEFT SPACE FOR A

03:09:37.733 --> 03:09:39.735
LOT OF THAT IN THE BILL TO BE

03:09:39.801 --> 03:09:41.269
WORKED THROUGH I THINK THIS THE

03:09:41.336 --> 03:09:42.571
UNIT IS ASIAN ISSUE AND SORT OF

03:09:42.637 --> 03:09:44.473
POROSITY RIGHTS IS ANOTHER BIG

03:09:44.539 --> 03:09:45.607
ONE WE KNOW THERE'S A SPLIT

03:09:45.674 --> 03:09:47.008
STATE BETWEEN- THE MINERAL

03:09:47.075 --> 03:09:49.611
STATE- AS WELL AS THE SERVICES

03:09:49.678 --> 03:09:51.680
STATE AND- WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:09:51.747 --> 03:09:53.715
THAT. THE PROJECTS THAT WE DO

03:09:53.782 --> 03:09:55.951
ONE OF THIS BILL- THEY WORK AND

03:09:56.017 --> 03:09:57.519
THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE VIABLE AND

03:09:57.586 --> 03:09:59.921
THEY REALLY DO PROVIDE NOT JUST-

03:09:59.988 --> 03:10:01.890
ENVIRONMENTALLY DURABLE PATH TO

03:10:01.957 --> 03:10:03.625
GO FORWARD BUT BUT ONE OF THE

03:10:03.692 --> 03:10:06.361
MARKETS ONE THE WORK FORCE WHEN

03:10:06.428 --> 03:10:07.829
THAT INVESTORS ARE GOING TO BE.

03:10:07.896 --> 03:10:09.898
SEIZE FEASIBLE SO I APPRECIATE

03:10:09.965 --> 03:10:12.033
WHAT YOU'VE DONE- TAKING A FIRST

03:10:12.100 --> 03:10:14.069
SMALL STEP I THINK IS THE

03:10:14.136 --> 03:10:18.106
SMARTER APPROACH HERE- AND- YEAH

03:10:18.173 --> 03:10:19.307
I JUST WANT TO PLEDGE OUR OUR

03:10:19.374 --> 03:10:20.542
WORK I KNOW THERE WERE SOME

03:10:20.609 --> 03:10:21.576
RECOMMENDATIONS TAKE INTO

03:10:21.643 --> 03:10:24.246
ACCOUNT- BY THE COMMITTEE FROM

03:10:24.312 --> 03:10:26.281
FROM OUR COMMITTEE HERE BUT- BUT

03:10:26.348 --> 03:10:29.251
I THINK. I WOULD BE CURIOUS AND

03:10:29.317 --> 03:10:33.288
YOU CAN DO. IT IN YOUR CLOSER

03:10:33.355 --> 03:10:34.723
OTHERS CAN MAKE REMARKS BUT- HOW

03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:36.591
TO DEAL. THAT SORT OF THE

03:10:36.658 --> 03:10:37.492
UNDERLYING A STATE AND MAKING

03:10:37.559 --> 03:10:38.727
SURE THERE'S ENOUGH CERTAINTY

03:10:38.794 --> 03:10:41.296
ABOUT- THE RIGHTS TO THAT VALUE

03:10:41.363 --> 03:10:43.498
THAT ASSET. AND THEN SORT OF

03:10:43.565 --> 03:10:45.267
RECOURSE THAT WE HAVE NGUYEN.

03:10:45.333 --> 03:10:46.902
SEISMICITY FOR INSTANCE RIGHT

03:10:46.968 --> 03:10:48.870
LIKE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT A-

03:10:48.937 --> 03:10:50.438
THERE'S NOT REALLY MUCH OF A

03:10:50.505 --> 03:10:52.040
REGIME ON HOW UNDER THE CLASSICS

03:10:52.107 --> 03:10:53.241
WILL CITY PA THEY DON'T REALLY

03:10:53.308 --> 03:10:55.310
HAVE SEISMICITY BUILT INTO THAT

03:10:55.377 --> 03:10:57.279
FRAMEWORK. HOW CAN WE DO THAT IS

03:10:57.345 --> 03:10:59.381
A STATE IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY SO

03:10:59.447 --> 03:11:01.149
JUST SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THINK

03:11:01.216 --> 03:11:01.950
ABOUT GOING FORWARD BUT- HAVING

03:11:02.017 --> 03:11:04.352
MOVED THE- BILL IT AT THE

03:11:04.419 --> 03:11:05.320
APPROPRIATE TIME AND PROCEED TO

03:11:05.387 --> 03:11:06.955
WORK. YEAH AND I WILL I WILL SAY

03:11:07.022 --> 03:11:09.191

03:11:09.257 --> 03:11:10.392
RESPECT OUR FRIENDS THE RULES

03:11:10.458 --> 03:11:11.459
COMMITTEE I WAS A LITTLE

03:11:11.526 --> 03:11:14.029
MYSTIFIED BY THE WAY THAT THIS

03:11:14.095 --> 03:11:17.165
BILL WAS- WAS AND REFERRED I DO

03:11:17.232 --> 03:11:18.333
THINK THAT NATURAL SERVICES AND

03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:19.701
WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN. THE

03:11:19.768 --> 03:11:21.903
OBVIOUS PLACE FOR THIS TO GO-

03:11:21.970 --> 03:11:23.905
BUT THAT BEING SAID- WE DID

03:11:23.972 --> 03:11:25.807
INCLUDE AN EXTENSIVE NOTE FROM

03:11:25.874 --> 03:11:28.143
THE COMMITTEE ON THE ANALYSIS

03:11:28.210 --> 03:11:29.945
TWELVE ON PAGES TWELVE AND

03:11:30.011 --> 03:11:30.712
THIRTEEN I JUST I WOULD ASK YOU

03:11:37.886 --> 03:11:39.855
ACTORS WATER COMMITTEE I TO

03:11:39.921 --> 03:11:41.723
ADDRESS SOME OF THE TECHNICAL

03:11:41.790 --> 03:11:43.625
DETAILS THE CONCERNS THAT WERE

03:11:43.692 --> 03:11:45.393
RAISED IN THE IN THE COMIC GIVEN

03:11:45.460 --> 03:11:47.696
THEIR- PARTICULAR EXPERTISE IN

03:11:47.762 --> 03:11:49.364
IN THE AREA OF. OIL EXTRACTION

03:11:49.431 --> 03:11:52.801
CARBON CAPTURE ITS ADDRESS SO-

03:11:52.868 --> 03:11:55.637
WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING I WOULD- I

03:11:55.704 --> 03:11:57.038
TO MOVE BY CENTER STERN AND WE

03:11:57.105 --> 03:11:58.974

CONSTRUCTED AS PILOT PROJECT.

03:12:06.181 --> 03:12:08.216
AND THE BENEFIT OF THAT IS THAT

03:12:08.283 --> 03:12:11.920
AS PILOT PROJECTS. WE HOPE TO.

03:12:11.987 --> 03:12:16.091
LEARN YOU CAN ALWAYS KNOW WHAT.

03:12:16.157 --> 03:12:19.728
WHAT AND- DIFFICULTY IN MY FACE

03:12:19.794 --> 03:12:21.396
OR WHAT COMPLICATIONS YOU COULD

03:12:21.463 --> 03:12:23.265
FACE UNTIL YOU PILOTED IF WE

03:12:23.331 --> 03:12:25.367
JUST OPENED UP CARBON CAPTURE

03:12:25.433 --> 03:12:28.203
AND STORAGE TO OSMAN INDUSTRY OR

03:12:28.270 --> 03:12:30.171
TO EVEN MORE INDUSTRIES BEFORE

03:12:30.238 --> 03:12:33.909
WE'VEREALLY HAD THE ABILITY TO

03:12:33.975 --> 03:12:35.644
TRY IT OUT THE MEASURE IT THE

03:12:35.710 --> 03:12:38.513
WAY IT IS TWO RESEARCH WHICH IS

03:12:38.580 --> 03:12:40.548
PART OF THE REASON THE WE HAVE

03:12:40.615 --> 03:12:41.883
THE EDUCATION COMPONENT TO HAVE

03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:44.519
A CARD ESTABLISH EITHER AT A

03:12:44.586 --> 03:12:46.855
COMMUNITY COLLEGES CSU OR UC AN

03:12:46.922 --> 03:12:48.890
INNOVATION HUB IN ORDER TO LOOK

03:12:48.957 --> 03:12:50.558
AT THIS BECAUSE WE WANT TO GAIN

03:12:50.625 --> 03:12:52.327
KNOWLEDGE I MEAN I PERSONALLY

03:12:52.394 --> 03:12:53.361
BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO

03:12:53.428 --> 03:12:54.696
DO CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE.

03:12:54.763 --> 03:12:56.665
IN A LOT MORE THAN JUST CEMENT

03:12:56.731 --> 03:12:58.900
BUT THIS IS A GOOD FIRST START

03:12:58.967 --> 03:13:00.969
AND LIKE SO MANY THINGS I MEAN

03:13:01.036 --> 03:13:03.371
YES THERE THERE COULD BE AN

03:13:03.438 --> 03:13:04.439
EARTHQUAKE AND THAT WOULD

03:13:04.506 --> 03:13:05.941
RELEASE THE CARBON THAT WAS

03:13:06.007 --> 03:13:07.776
GEOLOGICALLY STORED MOST LIKELY

03:13:07.842 --> 03:13:09.878

TECHNICAL BILLS AROUND OUR

03:14:42.437 --> 03:14:44.739
CLIMATE CRISIS THERE ARE SHORT

03:14:44.806 --> 03:14:47.776
LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS THAT

03:14:47.842 --> 03:14:49.778
ONLY LASTS THE ATMOSPHERE TWENTY

03:14:49.844 --> 03:14:51.613
ODD YEARS BUT DURING THE TIME

03:14:51.679 --> 03:14:53.548
THEY ARE IN THE ATMOSPHERE THERE

03:14:53.615 --> 03:14:55.383
ARE THOUSANDS OF TIMES MORE

03:14:55.450 --> 03:14:57.619
DAMAGING TO THE CLIMATE. THAN

03:14:57.685 --> 03:14:59.587
CARBON DIOXIDE SO GIVEN THAT

03:14:59.654 --> 03:15:01.523

AROUND THE LATEST ANTARCTIC ICE

03:15:07.362 --> 03:15:10.031
SHELF THE JUST- COLLAPSED- WE

03:15:10.098 --> 03:15:12.333
NEED TO ACT AGGRESSIVELY BUT

03:15:12.400 --> 03:15:13.802
ACTING AGGRESSIVELY AROUND THE

03:15:13.868 --> 03:15:15.904
FULL TRANSITION OFF FOSSIL FUELS

03:15:15.970 --> 03:15:18.073
IS A LITTLE HARDER IT'S NOT

03:15:18.139 --> 03:15:20.041
IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S HARDER AND

03:15:20.108 --> 03:15:22.310
SO IF WE CAN AS MUCH AS WE CAN

03:15:22.377 --> 03:15:24.245
GET. THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

03:15:24.312 --> 03:15:25.980
POLLUTANTS OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE

03:15:26.047 --> 03:15:27.849
RIGHT NOW THE BETTER OFF WE'RE

03:15:27.916 --> 03:15:29.617
GOING TO BE IN A PRICES TIME THE

03:15:29.684 --> 03:15:31.086
PARTICULAR SHORTLIVED POLLUTANT

03:15:31.152 --> 03:15:33.755
THAT 'M FOCUSED ON HERE IS HSCS

03:15:33.822 --> 03:15:34.456
USED IN REFRIGERATION AND AIR

03:15:34.522 --> 03:15:36.791
CONDITIONING NOW WE'VE ALREADY

03:15:36.858 --> 03:15:38.293
DONE LEGISLATION WE'VE GONE A

03:15:38.359 --> 03:15:43.364
LONG WAY TO- TO REDUCING THE-

03:15:43.431 --> 03:15:46.734
THE- G. EIGHT THE GLOBAL WARMING

03:15:46.801 --> 03:15:50.805
POTENTIAL OF THOSE AGENCIES BUT-

03:15:50.872 --> 03:15:52.507
THERE ARE. AVAILABLE ALL. NOW

03:15:52.574 --> 03:15:55.643
AND THERE ARE LOWER GWP OR

03:15:55.710 --> 03:15:56.811
GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL

03:15:56.878 --> 03:15:58.113
AGENCIES AVAILABLE ON THE

03:15:58.179 --> 03:16:00.381
MARKET. AND SO WE JUST NEED TO

03:16:00.448 --> 03:16:02.117
MORE AGGRESSIVELY MOVED TO DOES

03:16:02.183 --> 03:16:04.886
ADDITIONALLY. AT AIR

03:16:04.953 --> 03:16:06.621
CONDITIONERS REFRIGERANTS THEY

03:16:06.688 --> 03:16:09.524
LEAK AND IF THEY HAVE THE HIGHER

03:16:09.591 --> 03:16:11.659
GLOBAL WARMING HFC IN THEM AND

03:16:11.726 --> 03:16:13.628
IT LEAKS THEN THAT GOES INTO THE

03:16:13.695 --> 03:16:15.230
ATMOSPHERE SO THE MORE OF THAT

03:16:15.296 --> 03:16:16.731
WE CAN RECLAIM AND RECAPTURE

03:16:16.798 --> 03:16:18.266
THOSE AND WHILE MY BILL DOESN'T

03:16:18.333 --> 03:16:20.535
HAVE A SPECIFIC PROVISION. THAT

03:16:20.602 --> 03:16:23.371
REQUIRES THAT IT DOES LET CARD

03:16:23.438 --> 03:16:25.373
DEVELOP SOME PATHWAYS IN IF THEY

03:16:25.440 --> 03:16:28.176
HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCENTIVIZE

03:16:28.243 --> 03:16:30.011
THE CAPTURE OF THOSE

03:16:30.078 --> 03:16:33.047
REFRIGERANTS BEFORE THEY ESCAPE-

03:16:33.114 --> 03:16:34.449
AND I HOPE THAT THEY WILL

03:16:34.516 --> 03:16:36.784
DEVELOP A PROGRAM TO DO SO. ON

03:16:36.851 --> 03:16:39.053
THAT MY BILL AT LEAST CREATES

03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:39.921
THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO

03:16:39.988 --> 03:16:43.124
LOOK AT THAT- SO I'M GONNA LET

03:16:43.191 --> 03:16:46.995
MY- EXPERTS SPEAK FROM THE MAIN

GWP REFRIGERANTS AND THEY ARE

03:28:09.577 --> 03:28:11.645
USING THEM THEY'RE USING THE

03:28:11.712 --> 03:28:13.147
LEAST FLAMMABLE OF THEM NOT THE

03:28:13.214 --> 03:28:15.950
MOST BUT THEY ARE IN ALREADY IN

03:28:16.016 --> 03:28:18.819
APPLICATION IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN

03:28:18.886 --> 03:28:23.224
COUNTRIES NOW. ON CLEARLY THERE

03:28:23.290 --> 03:28:25.025
WHILE I'M MOVING UP THE DATE IT

03:28:25.092 --> 03:28:28.195
IS STILL GIVING SOME TIME FOR

03:28:28.262 --> 03:28:30.598
NOT ONLY CAR BUT THE INDUSTRY TO

03:28:30.664 --> 03:28:33.100
FOR THE IF IT'S PARTLY IT SENDS

03:28:33.167 --> 03:28:35.636
THAT MESSAGE TO THE PRODUCERS

03:28:35.703 --> 03:28:36.670
AND THE RESEARCHERS AND

03:28:36.737 --> 03:28:39.340
DEVELOPERS. IN ORDER TO GET US

03:28:39.406 --> 03:28:41.675
THE OPTIMAL IN MOST SAFE

03:28:41.742 --> 03:28:43.811
ALTERNATIVES WHEN I THINK ABOUT

03:28:43.878 --> 03:28:45.713
YEARS AGO WHEN I CARRIED THE

03:28:45.779 --> 03:28:48.549
BILL FOR- UTILITY GRADE ENERGY

03:28:48.616 --> 03:28:50.951
STORAGE THERE WERE THERE WERE NO

03:28:51.018 --> 03:28:53.721
UTILITY GRADE BATTERIES. AND-

03:28:53.787 --> 03:28:55.789
IT'S CONNECTED TO OUR GRID

03:28:55.856 --> 03:28:58.692
STORING STORING OUR ELECTRICITY

03:28:58.759 --> 03:29:00.628
AND NOW WE DIDN'T HAVE OUR THE

03:29:00.694 --> 03:29:02.429
LEAD OF THE MARKET ACROSS THE

03:29:02.496 --> 03:29:05.165
COUNTRY AND WE HAVE BUT YOU KNOW

03:29:05.232 --> 03:29:07.067
I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE EXACT

03:29:07.134 --> 03:29:08.736
NUMBERS BUT ANYWAY SO. THE SO AT

03:29:08.802 --> 03:29:11.305
LEAST WE KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT

03:29:11.372 --> 03:29:12.806
SOME OF THESE LOW GWP

03:29:12.873 --> 03:29:14.475
ALTERNATIVE REFRIGERANTS ARE IN

03:29:14.541 --> 03:29:17.444
USE IN EUROPE- BUT WE DO HAVE TO

03:29:17.511 --> 03:29:19.780
GET CC TO FIX THEIR BUILDING

03:29:19.847 --> 03:29:21.615
CODES AND THEY OBVIOUSLY WILL BE

03:29:21.682 --> 03:29:22.683
LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT

03:29:22.750 --> 03:29:24.551
FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS BECAUSE

03:29:24.618 --> 03:29:28.122
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT SAFETY- AND-

03:29:28.188 --> 03:29:30.758
MY STAFF WE ARE WORKING WITH THE

03:29:30.824 --> 03:29:33.093
INDUSTRY TO YOU KNOW TO LOOK AT

03:29:33.160 --> 03:29:34.628
WHAT ELSE WE NEED TO TWEAK TO

03:29:34.695 --> 03:29:37.164
MAKE IT. TO MAKE IT IS TO OPPOSE

03:29:37.231 --> 03:29:38.799
POSSIBLE AND IS SAFE AS POSSIBLE

03:29:38.866 --> 03:29:43.170
BUT THESE. ON NINETY TWO MAY

03:29:43.237 --> 03:29:44.238
HAVE THE COMMITTEE GO LONGER

03:29:44.305 --> 03:29:46.440
BUT- I STARTED WORKING I GOT

03:29:46.507 --> 03:29:48.375
INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE OF THE

03:29:48.442 --> 03:29:50.577
CLIMATE CRISIS THROUGH THE OZONE

03:29:50.644 --> 03:29:52.613
DEPLETION ISSUE. AND WHEN THE

03:29:52.680 --> 03:29:53.981
MONTREAL PROTOCOL IS REGAINING

03:29:54.048 --> 03:29:55.883
NEGOTIATED BACK IN THE LATE

03:29:55.950 --> 03:29:57.484
EIGHTIES EIGHTY EIGHT AND EIGHTY

03:29:57.551 --> 03:29:59.320
NINE. AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE

03:29:59.386 --> 03:30:01.822
USING CFCS WHICH WERE FAR MORE

03:30:01.889 --> 03:30:03.490
DAMAGING AND WE WERE USING THEM

03:30:03.557 --> 03:30:04.858
IN ALL KINDS OF THINGS BESIDES

03:30:04.925 --> 03:30:06.160
YOUR CONDITIONING AND

03:30:06.226 --> 03:30:08.062
REFRIGERANTS AND A STAR FROM

03:30:08.128 --> 03:30:09.530
PRODUCTION IT'S WHAT LED ME TO

03:30:09.596 --> 03:30:12.099
BAN STYROFOAM. BECAUSE

03:30:12.166 --> 03:30:18.005
BASICALLY- BUT ANYWAY. WHAT WHAT

03:30:18.072 --> 03:30:19.340
HAPPENED IS. IN THE MONTROSE PRO

03:30:19.406 --> 03:30:21.575
WE PROMOTE HSCS BECAUSE THEY

03:30:21.642 --> 03:30:24.278
WERE LESS. DEPLETING THE OZONE

03:30:24.345 --> 03:30:25.579
LATER WITHOUT FULLY

03:30:25.646 --> 03:30:28.349
UNDERSTANDING HOW SERIOUS THEY

03:30:28.415 --> 03:30:29.650
WERE IN TERMS OF THE CLIMATE

03:30:29.717 --> 03:30:31.685
CRISIS. BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE KNOWN

03:30:31.752 --> 03:30:34.455
THAT NOW FOR HOW MANY YEARS AGO

03:30:34.521 --> 03:30:36.323
WAS THAT THAT WAS SOME THIRTY

03:30:36.390 --> 03:30:38.659
FIVE YEARS AGO WE'VE KNOWN THAT.

03:30:38.726 --> 03:30:40.561
FOR AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS SO

03:30:40.627 --> 03:30:42.396
WE'RE KIND OF BEHIND GIVEN HOW

03:30:42.463 --> 03:30:44.531
LONG WE'VE KNOWN THAT THEE H.

03:30:44.598 --> 03:30:48.035
FC'S HALF THIS DAMAGE SO WE NEED

03:30:48.102 --> 03:30:51.438
TO ACCELERATE OUR- OUR ABILITY

03:30:51.505 --> 03:30:54.141
TO GET THE ALTERNATIVES. INTO

03:30:54.208 --> 03:30:55.242
THE MARKETPLACE AND BEING

03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:57.678
UTILIZED SO THANK YOU MISTER

03:30:57.745 --> 03:30:59.480
CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO ON MY

03:30:59.546 --> 03:31:02.716
OWN TIME SO LOOK I WANT TO SEE

03:31:02.783 --> 03:31:05.386
IS. DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE

03:31:05.452 --> 03:31:07.621
THE ENVIRONMENT WELL BUT AT THE

03:31:07.688 --> 03:31:08.288
SAME TIME- WE NOTICED IN

03:31:08.355 --> 03:31:09.556
CALIFORNIA THAT WE THE

03:31:09.623 --> 03:31:12.626
LEGISLATURE'S. APPROACH IS BEEN

03:31:12.693 --> 03:31:14.461
. MORE OF A MORE OF A STICK THEN

03:31:14.528 --> 03:31:16.497
THE CARROT AND WHEN I SAY THAT I

03:31:16.563 --> 03:31:18.766
MEAN IT. ON THIS GIVEN EXAMPLE

03:31:18.832 --> 03:31:21.235
WE WANT TO GO TO ELECTRIFICATION

03:31:21.301 --> 03:31:23.137
OF CARS. TO HELP THE

03:31:23.203 --> 03:31:25.005
ENVIRONMENT. AND WE WANT TO GO

03:31:25.072 --> 03:31:26.640
WE WANT TO ALLOW THEIR THIRTY

03:31:26.707 --> 03:31:28.108
MILLION CARS IN CALIFORNIA. IN A

03:31:28.175 --> 03:31:29.977
MILLION NUMBER ELECTRIC. BUT OUR

03:31:30.044 --> 03:31:31.345
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR GRID IS

03:31:31.412 --> 03:31:32.713
NOT THERE YET SO STRIVING THE

03:31:32.780 --> 03:31:35.249
COST OF FUEL UP. IN CALIFORNIA'S

03:31:35.315 --> 03:31:36.884
A LOT OF THESE THINGS DRIVE THE

03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:39.219
COST OF LIVING UP IN RIGHT NOW-

03:31:39.286 --> 03:31:40.354
IF YOU'VE NOT NOTICED THAT

03:31:40.421 --> 03:31:41.789
CALIFORNIA'S VERY EXPENSIVE

03:31:41.855 --> 03:31:44.324
PLACE TO LIVE IN IS BECAUSE WE

03:31:44.391 --> 03:31:44.892
ARE LEADING. ARE SUPPOSEDLY

03:31:44.958 --> 03:31:47.795
LEADING AND- A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:31:47.861 --> 03:31:48.929
AREAS WHEN IT COMES TO. CLIMATE

03:31:48.996 --> 03:31:52.466
SO. AS A LEGISLATOR I'M TRYING

03:31:52.533 --> 03:31:54.968
TO BALANCE OUT. DO IS THE

03:31:55.035 --> 03:31:55.569
TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO DO THE

03:31:55.636 --> 03:31:57.171
JOB THAT WE WANT TO GET DONE.

03:31:57.237 --> 03:31:59.306
AND OUT OF AND THE ABILITY TO BE

03:31:59.373 --> 03:32:01.575
ABLE TO- MAKE SURE THAT SOMEBODY

03:32:01.642 --> 03:32:03.977
CAN AFFORD TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AT

03:32:04.044 --> 03:32:05.913
THE SAME TIME SO WE DON'T DIVERT

03:32:05.979 --> 03:32:07.414
OUR- INDUSTRIES AWAY FROM

03:32:07.481 --> 03:32:09.283
CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY. MAKE IT

03:32:09.349 --> 03:32:11.819
SO THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND-

03:32:11.885 --> 03:32:13.887
AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

03:32:13.954 --> 03:32:15.756
CAN ACTUALLY STAY ON

03:32:15.823 --> 03:32:17.758
CALIFORNIANS HAVE A IN THIS CASE

03:32:17.825 --> 03:32:19.326
. A REFRIGERATOR A REFRIGERATOR

03:32:19.393 --> 03:32:20.627
IN THEIR LOCAL STORE THAT

03:32:20.694 --> 03:32:22.396
ACTUALLY DOESN'T DRIVE THE COST

03:32:22.463 --> 03:32:23.897
OF THEIR FOOD UP SO THOSE ARE

03:32:23.964 --> 03:32:25.199
THE BALANCES THAT ARE REALLY

03:32:25.265 --> 03:32:26.567
DIFFICULT IN THIS LEGISLATURE

03:32:26.633 --> 03:32:28.402
AND QUITE FRANKLY I'M FRUSTRATED

03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:29.770
AT THE FACT THAT WE ALWAYS LOOK

03:32:29.837 --> 03:32:31.772
AT LIKE A WE JUST HAVE TO FORCE

03:32:31.839 --> 03:32:33.574
THEM TO DO IT. THAT'S WHAT THIS

03:32:33.640 --> 03:32:36.210
BILL IS GOING TO DO AND THE

03:32:36.276 --> 03:32:37.578
OTHER BILLS THAT WE SEE TODAY IS

03:32:37.644 --> 03:32:38.645
FORCING THEM TO DO IT AT THE

03:32:38.712 --> 03:32:40.547
SAME TIME THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT

03:32:40.614 --> 03:32:41.648
THERE IT WOULD HAVE THE BUILDING

03:32:41.715 --> 03:32:43.250
INDUSTRY. WE DON'T HAVE THE

03:32:43.317 --> 03:32:44.585
REGULATIONS FOR THE BUILDING

03:32:44.651 --> 03:32:45.886
FOLKS ON THE SAME TO AND ALL

03:32:45.953 --> 03:32:47.621
THAT DOES IS DRIVE THE COST OF

03:32:47.688 --> 03:32:49.356
HOMES AND FOOD AND THINGS THAT

03:32:49.423 --> 03:32:50.491
WE NEED EVERY DAY UP WITHOUT I

03:32:50.557 --> 03:32:52.459
THINK WE'RE MOVING TOO FAST AND

03:32:52.526 --> 03:32:54.761
WE NEED TO STEP BACK SO FOR

03:32:54.828 --> 03:32:55.662
TODAY I'M GONNA NOT BE

03:32:55.729 --> 03:32:56.330
SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. INTEL WEEK

03:32:56.396 --> 03:32:58.332
MAYBE SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND

03:32:58.398 --> 03:32:59.967
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT SEE HOW IT'S

03:33:00.033 --> 03:33:01.802
GONNA WORK AT THE END AND WHAT

03:33:01.869 --> 03:33:03.303
THE COST IS TO THE CONSUMER FOR.

03:33:03.370 --> 03:33:05.939
THE REDUCTION IN GHG ARE WE

03:33:06.006 --> 03:33:07.074
REALLY GETTING OUR VALUE THERE.

03:33:07.141 --> 03:33:09.109
THANK YOU. YEAH OKAY. SENATE

03:33:09.176 --> 03:33:11.812
BILL I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE

03:33:11.879 --> 03:33:12.946
COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE ON THAT

03:33:13.013 --> 03:33:14.648
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND IN

03:33:14.715 --> 03:33:16.216
PARTICULAR THOSE IN THE

03:33:16.283 --> 03:33:19.119
EXTREMELY HARD AREAS OF- IN LAND

03:33:19.186 --> 03:33:21.555
ORANGE COUNTY- THEY THINK THAT

03:33:21.622 --> 03:33:22.723
THEY COULDN'T RUN THEIR AIR

03:33:22.789 --> 03:33:24.158
CONDITIONERS BECAUSE THESE

03:33:24.224 --> 03:33:25.325
PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE YEAH

03:33:25.392 --> 03:33:27.194
THAT. WOULD BE DEVASTATING AND

03:33:27.261 --> 03:33:29.329
SO THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS- NOBLE

03:33:29.396 --> 03:33:31.899
GOAL FINE NO QUESTION ON THAT

03:33:31.965 --> 03:33:33.433
BUT I THINK IT IS MOVING AWFULLY

03:33:33.500 --> 03:33:35.802
FAST AND TWO WE HAVE SCIENCE

03:33:35.869 --> 03:33:37.304
THEY'RE TELLING US THAT WE CAN

03:33:37.371 --> 03:33:38.672
GET THERE IN ODD I GUESS TO

03:33:38.739 --> 03:33:40.974
RECYCLE REFRIGERANTS. ARE REALLY

03:33:41.041 --> 03:33:42.142
GOING TO BE READILY AVAILABLE

03:33:42.209 --> 03:33:44.278
WITHOUT HAVING TO PURCHASE THEM

03:33:44.344 --> 03:33:46.813
OUT OF STATE FOR YOU KNOW VERY

03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:47.981
HIGH COST YOUR STARTING HIT HIT

03:33:48.048 --> 03:33:49.983
THE WHOLE ENERGY AREA AGAIN AND

03:33:50.050 --> 03:33:50.984
THAT IS PROBABLY THE HIGHEST

03:33:51.051 --> 03:33:52.953
COST. ALL RIGHT NOW FOR PEOPLE

03:33:53.020 --> 03:33:55.289
IN LOW INCOME AREAS SO- I JUST

03:33:55.355 --> 03:33:56.557
CIRCLE THAT TO A LITTLE MORE

03:33:56.623 --> 03:33:58.492
TIME IS NEEDED BUT I DO

03:33:58.559 --> 03:34:00.427
APPRECIATE THE GOAL ABSOLUTELY

03:34:00.494 --> 03:34:02.596
BUT TODAY I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

03:34:02.663 --> 03:34:04.531
AFFORD. IT HOPE YOU LICK IT AND

03:34:04.598 --> 03:34:05.666
MEHMET PERHAPS WHERE WE WOULD BE

03:34:05.732 --> 03:34:07.701
ABLE- HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

03:34:07.768 --> 03:34:11.939
FRANKLY TO ALLOW. EXISTING IF

03:34:12.005 --> 03:34:14.841
THE BE RECYCLED REFRIGERANTS ARE

03:34:14.908 --> 03:34:16.843
AVAILABLE TO ALLOW SOME OF THOSE

03:34:16.910 --> 03:34:17.878
OLDER HOMES WITH THESE OLDER

03:34:17.945 --> 03:34:20.013
APPLIANCES TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE

03:34:20.080 --> 03:34:22.115
EXISTING ONES FOR A CERTAIN

03:34:22.182 --> 03:34:24.117
PERIOD OF TIME IF THERE'S

03:34:24.184 --> 03:34:25.619
EVIDENCE THAT THE- RECYCLED ONES

03:34:25.686 --> 03:34:27.120
ARE NOT AVAILABLE FUNDING TO

03:34:27.187 --> 03:34:31.391
THAT EFFECT. THAT COULD BE

03:34:31.458 --> 03:34:37.331
MONITORED. OKAY YES SIR I'M LIKE

03:34:37.397 --> 03:34:38.865
TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE

03:34:38.932 --> 03:34:40.500
APPROPRIATE TIME BUT I ALSO WANT

03:34:40.567 --> 03:34:43.203
TO- THANK THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW

03:34:43.270 --> 03:34:45.205
WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING

03:34:45.272 --> 03:34:49.176
ABOUT- ALTERNATIVE REFRIGERANTS

03:34:49.243 --> 03:34:50.544
. BUT THE WAY I UNDERSTAND YOUR

03:34:50.611 --> 03:34:54.147
BILL IS HE- THE DEFINITION OF

03:34:54.214 --> 03:34:56.683
NEW VERY LOW GWP REFRIGERANT

03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:58.185
TECHNOLOGY ALSO INCLUDES THINGS

03:34:58.252 --> 03:34:59.786
LIKE HEAT PUMPS A DON'T ACTUALLY

03:34:59.853 --> 03:35:02.723
REQUIRE THAT REFRIGERANT AT ALL

03:35:02.789 --> 03:35:04.324
AND SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A

03:35:04.391 --> 03:35:05.826
BURGEONING MARKET PLACE RIGHT

03:35:05.892 --> 03:35:07.461
NOW IN THAT SPACE TO PROVIDE

03:35:07.527 --> 03:35:09.529
BOTH COOLING AND HEATING SO

03:35:09.596 --> 03:35:10.597
PERHAPS IN YOUR CLOTHES YOU

03:35:10.664 --> 03:35:13.867
COULD. TALK ABOUT IT SEEMS LIKE-

03:35:13.934 --> 03:35:14.668
THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOESN'T

03:35:14.735 --> 03:35:18.905
NEED TO BE THAT MUCH MORE-

03:35:18.972 --> 03:35:22.542
STUDYING OR- OR- DELAY TO THINK

03:35:22.609 --> 03:35:23.810
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT COOLEY

03:35:23.877 --> 03:35:27.147
POSSIBLY REPLACE OUR BROKEN OLD

03:35:27.214 --> 03:35:29.449
COOLING SYSTEMS WITH BECAUSE-

03:35:29.516 --> 03:35:31.018

CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY THIRTY. IF

03:35:36.623 --> 03:35:38.425
YOU LOOK AT IF THE CECE'S PLAN

03:35:38.492 --> 03:35:40.427
TAKES EFFECT AT THE SAME TIME

03:35:40.494 --> 03:35:42.562
THAT YOUR BILL TIMELINE IS

03:35:42.629 --> 03:35:43.664
STARTING TO TAKE EFFECT IN

03:35:43.730 --> 03:35:46.233
THEORY WE CAN HAVE- SOME REALLY

03:35:46.300 --> 03:35:47.868
EXCITING MARKET TRANSFORMATION

03:35:47.934 --> 03:35:48.835

NATURE INCLUDING GOALS FOR WHICH

03:37:22.095 --> 03:37:24.164
WE DID NOT YET HAVE THE

03:37:24.231 --> 03:37:24.831
TECHNOLOGIES IN COMMERCIAL

03:37:24.898 --> 03:37:27.200
APPLICATION IN THIS CASE THOSE

03:37:27.267 --> 03:37:29.870
LOADS THE W. P. REFRIGERANTS ARE

03:37:29.936 --> 03:37:32.839
IN USE THEY ARE NOT AS IN USE IN

03:37:32.906 --> 03:37:36.109
THE US BUT THEY ARE IN USE IN

03:37:36.176 --> 03:37:39.045
EUROPE. AND THE THIRD IN OUR DC

03:37:39.112 --> 03:37:42.215

MOVING UPDATE IS STILL TWENTY

03:37:53.794 --> 03:37:55.162
THIRTY FIVE THAT IS THIRTEEN

03:37:55.228 --> 03:37:56.630
YEARS FROM NOW SO WHILE THAT MAY

03:37:56.696 --> 03:37:58.565
SEEM SHORT IT'S NOT SHORTEN WE

03:37:58.632 --> 03:38:01.134
THINK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE THE LINK

03:38:01.201 --> 03:38:02.035
YOU KNOW WHEN THIS GOT

03:38:02.102 --> 03:38:03.637

03:38:14.548 --> 03:38:15.749
SINCE WE SINCE THE WHOLE WORLD

03:38:15.816 --> 03:38:17.417
IS FOCUSED ON THIS CLAIM IT

03:38:17.484 --> 03:38:20.187
CRISIS AND THERE IS MUCH.

03:38:20.253 --> 03:38:21.822
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

03:38:21.888 --> 03:38:23.623
INNOVATION UNDERWAY I AM

03:38:23.690 --> 03:38:26.226
CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO

03:38:26.293 --> 03:38:28.295
MEET THIS- ADDITIONALLY THE IT

03:38:28.361 --> 03:38:31.131
DOES NOT REQUIRE ANYONE WHO HAS

03:38:31.198 --> 03:38:33.133
A CURRENT AIR CONDITIONER IN

03:38:33.200 --> 03:38:35.035
THEIR HOME TO GET RID OF THAT

03:38:35.101 --> 03:38:36.636
AIR CONDITIONER. OR YOU KNOW.

03:38:36.703 --> 03:38:40.440
NOT BE ABLE TO- REPLACE IF IT'S

03:38:40.507 --> 03:38:41.741
IF IT'S REFRIGERANT NEEDS

03:38:41.808 --> 03:38:44.344
REPLACEMENT FOR A GOOD WHILE AND

03:38:44.411 --> 03:38:46.179
BY THAT POINT. THE SHOULD BE

03:38:46.246 --> 03:38:48.448
VERY AVAILABLE NOW OR AT LEAST

03:38:48.515 --> 03:38:50.417
THEIR BE RECLAIMED MARKET SHOULD

03:38:50.484 --> 03:38:54.721
BE MUCH MORE VIBRANT- I WANTED

03:38:54.788 --> 03:38:57.524
TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THE AMENDMENTS

03:38:57.591 --> 03:38:59.292

THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE IN

03:39:00.660 --> 03:39:03.897

LOW GWP ALTERNATIVES THAT HAVE A

03:39:09.436 --> 03:39:11.104
GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF LESS

03:39:11.171 --> 03:39:13.573
THAN TEN. IT IS THE- REMOVING

03:39:13.640 --> 03:39:17.244
THE SECTOR SPECIFIC REFERENCES-

03:39:17.310 --> 03:39:19.513
THE SUIT WOULD BE ALL SECTORS

03:39:19.579 --> 03:39:21.014
RATHER IN THAT SECTOR SPECIFIC

03:39:21.081 --> 03:39:22.949
REFERENCES. AND THEN THE

03:39:23.016 --> 03:39:24.317

AND NOW TO REFRIGERANTS IN

03:39:30.857 --> 03:39:32.492
EQUIPMENT FUNDED BY THE ENERGY

03:39:32.559 --> 03:39:34.761

BAND DOES DO THAT. I'M JUST. THE

03:55:36.655 --> 03:55:38.858

03:55:50.936 --> 03:55:52.771
DECISION THAT I HAVE TO MAKE IS

03:55:52.838 --> 03:55:53.839

KNOW IT'S GREAT IT'S GREAT THE

03:56:00.379 --> 03:56:01.814
COOPERATION BUT- I DON'T THINK

03:56:31.010 --> 03:56:33.078
SOME. ONE MANUFACTURER THAT'S

03:56:33.145 --> 03:56:34.980

ON THE ON THE PLANT AND WASTE

04:08:24.623 --> 04:08:25.991
ISSUES I'M ALREADY EVEN THIS

04:08:26.057 --> 04:08:27.859
MORNING AND FOLKS KNOW THAT I'VE

04:08:27.926 --> 04:08:30.362
BEEN. WORKING ON THIS- AS WELL

04:08:30.428 --> 04:08:33.365
I'M- WE KNOW THAT IT'S

04:08:33.431 --> 04:08:34.266
HEARTENING STATISTICS RIGHT

04:08:34.332 --> 04:08:35.734
HUMANS HAVE CREATED EIGHT POINT

04:08:35.800 --> 04:08:37.135
THREE BILLION TONS OF PLASTIC IN

04:08:37.202 --> 04:08:38.303
THE WORLD TODAY IT'S THE

04:08:38.370 --> 04:08:39.804
EQUIVALENT OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION

04:08:39.871 --> 04:08:42.307
JUMBO JETS. I ROUGHLY EIGHT

04:08:42.374 --> 04:08:43.675
MILLION METRIC TONS OF THIS

04:08:43.742 --> 04:08:45.377
WASTE ENDS UP IN OUR OCEANS EACH

04:08:45.443 --> 04:08:47.045
YEAR LESS THAN TEN PERCENT. OF

04:08:47.112 --> 04:08:48.647
PLASTIC PRODUCED EACH YEAR IS

04:08:48.713 --> 04:08:49.547
RECYCLED. IN MOST CASES THE

04:08:49.614 --> 04:08:51.049
MATERIAL THAT IS RECYCLED

04:08:51.116 --> 04:08:52.517
ACTUALLY DOWN CYCLE SO IT ENDS

04:08:52.584 --> 04:08:55.587
UP IN A LESS. HIGHER USE. I WALK

04:08:55.654 --> 04:08:56.988
CALIFORNIA HAS DONE MORE TO

04:08:57.055 --> 04:08:58.256
PROMOTE THE RECYCLABILITY OF

04:08:58.323 --> 04:08:59.357
SINGLE USE PLASTICS IN RECENT

04:08:59.424 --> 04:09:11.036
YEARS WE KNOW THE RECYCLING IS.

04:09:11.102 --> 04:09:11.569
NOT A CURE ALL NOT ONLY IS

04:09:11.636 --> 04:09:14.005
STRICTLY WITH IN SCOPE WITH WITH

04:09:14.072 --> 04:09:15.507
ONE AND FOR OF THE MOST RECYCLED

04:09:15.573 --> 04:09:16.574
ITEMS. WATER BOTTLES OF MANY OF

04:09:16.641 --> 04:09:18.476
US HAVE. AND SO MANY OF THESE

04:09:18.543 --> 04:09:20.412
ARE STILL IN JUST OF THE- OF THE

04:09:20.478 --> 04:09:25.417
HI- SO I. WE DO NEED TO PUSH. TO

04:09:25.483 --> 04:09:27.352
ENSURE THAT NOT. USING FOR A

04:09:27.419 --> 04:09:28.486
PACK. WHICH DESTINED FOR THE

04:09:28.553 --> 04:09:29.688
LANDFILL WE ALSO NEED TO OTHER

04:09:29.754 --> 04:09:31.956
OPTIONS WELL. SO WE USE AND

04:09:32.023 --> 04:09:34.125
REFILL. AS PERHAPS OF THE CAN. I

04:09:34.192 --> 04:09:34.993
BECOMING MORE POPULAR IN ITS THE

04:09:35.060 --> 04:09:36.528
BEST APPROACH FOR MANY- STAR FOR

04:09:36.594 --> 04:09:37.562
EXAMPLE. I JUST ANNOUNCE A MOVE

04:09:37.629 --> 04:09:39.431
TO REUSABLE CUPS WHICH IS VERY

04:09:39.497 --> 04:09:40.432
EXCITING AND BY SHIFTING ALL

04:09:40.498 --> 04:09:42.200
SINGLE USE ITEMS TO REVIEW WOULD

04:09:42.267 --> 04:09:46.237
BE- YOU THAT THAT THAT REALLY

04:09:46.304 --> 04:09:46.971
WOULD BE A CHALLENGE- BUT I

04:09:47.038 --> 04:09:49.174
TRANSITION TO WERE USED TO

04:09:49.240 --> 04:09:51.776
REFILL- AS- YOU KNOW WE KNOW IS

04:09:51.843 --> 04:09:52.844
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. OVERNIGHT

04:09:52.911 --> 04:09:54.346
SO THIS BILL TAKES A LONGER VIEW

04:09:54.412 --> 04:09:55.847
OF THE PLASTICS CRISIS AND

04:09:55.914 --> 04:09:56.648
BEGINS TO CONTEMPLATE HOW TO

04:09:56.715 --> 04:09:58.116
MOVE TOWARDS. RENEWABLE

04:09:58.183 --> 04:09:59.684
SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVES FOR

04:09:59.751 --> 04:10:01.286
SINGLE USE ITEMS THE BILL SEEKS

04:10:01.353 --> 04:10:02.821
TO SET A STANDARD. FOR MATERIAL

04:10:02.887 --> 04:10:04.923
THAT CAN TRULY BREAK DOWN IN THE

04:10:04.989 --> 04:10:06.524
ENVIRONMENT FULLY AND QUICKLY AS

04:10:06.591 --> 04:10:07.659
OPPOSED TO FAMILY PERSISTENT

04:10:07.726 --> 04:10:09.427
FOSSIL FUEL BASED PLASTICS. THIS

04:10:09.494 --> 04:10:11.162
WILL ENSURE THAT INNOVATIVE

04:10:11.229 --> 04:10:11.629
COMPANIES WORKING ON

04:10:11.696 --> 04:10:12.897
ALTERNATIVES TO SYNTHETIC.

04:10:12.964 --> 04:10:14.466
PLASTIC PRODUCTS ARE ABLE TO

04:10:14.532 --> 04:10:15.367
COMMUNICATE THEIR BENEFITS

04:10:15.433 --> 04:10:16.701
DIRECTLY TO ENVIRONMENTALLY

04:10:16.768 --> 04:10:18.002
MINDED CALIFORNIANS WHO WON AND

04:10:18.069 --> 04:10:19.771
OR IS IT RELIANCE ON SINGLE USE

04:10:19.838 --> 04:10:21.239
ITEMS THAT ARE. USED FOR JUST

04:10:21.306 --> 04:10:22.540
MINUTES BUT THEY LOST HUNDREDS

04:10:22.607 --> 04:10:24.943
IF NOT THOUSANDS OF YEARS ON OUR

04:10:25.009 --> 04:10:25.577
ENVIRONMENT NOT TO MENTION THE

04:10:25.643 --> 04:10:26.378
FACT THAT THESE ITMS ARE

04:10:26.444 --> 04:10:28.313
PRODUCTS. OF THE FOSSIL FUELS

04:10:28.380 --> 04:10:30.115
INDUSTRY IN THE THEIR PAYER NOT

04:10:30.181 --> 04:10:31.583
CONTRIBUTING TO GREENHOUSE GAS

04:10:31.649 --> 04:10:33.184
EMISSIONS AND THEIR PRODUCTION.

04:10:33.251 --> 04:10:34.753
TO THE BILL- IS ONCE AGAIN A

04:10:34.819 --> 04:10:35.854
WORK IN PROGRESS THERE'S NO

04:10:35.920 --> 04:10:37.222
STANDARD THAT WE CAN SIMPLY

04:10:37.288 --> 04:10:39.023
POINT TO. THAT WOULD ALLOW

04:10:39.090 --> 04:10:40.091
PRODUCERS TO ADVERTISE THEIR

04:10:40.158 --> 04:10:41.626
PRODUCT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO

04:10:41.693 --> 04:10:43.828
SYNTHETIC PLASTIC. I IN FACT OUR

04:10:55.807 --> 04:11:01.679
THAT SPACE. THE BILL. TALK YOUR

04:11:01.746 --> 04:11:04.149
EAR OFF ABOUT THAT. SO WE CAN

04:11:04.215 --> 04:11:05.150
SIMPLY RELY ON A COMPOSED. STAY

04:11:05.216 --> 04:11:06.951
FOR- FOR A FEW REASONS FOR ALL

04:11:07.018 --> 04:11:08.420
SUMMIT. ARE ARE- TECH. AND

04:11:08.486 --> 04:11:10.989
COMPOSTABLE. BUT THEY DID BIG

04:11:11.055 --> 04:11:11.623
THEY JUST COULDN'T MEET A HOME

04:11:11.689 --> 04:11:13.558
COMPOSTING. FOR BIODEGRADABLE

04:11:13.625 --> 04:11:15.427
STANDARD. IN FACT A MATERIAL

04:11:15.493 --> 04:11:16.361
THAT IS HOME COMPOSTABLE MAY NOT

EVEN NEED TO STAND FOR

04:11:17.829 --> 04:11:20.131
SOMETHING. THE MOST BREAKDOWN IN

04:11:20.198 --> 04:11:21.766
MARINE ENVIRONMENTS- SO YOU KNOW

04:11:21.833 --> 04:11:23.501
I'M I'M BIG GIVE YOU GIVE YOU

YOU'D NEVER LEAVE. ON YOUR ON

04:11:28.406 --> 04:11:31.543
YOUR- ON YOUR RANCH OUT THERE. I

04:11:31.609 --> 04:11:32.744
STRUGGLE THIS MYSELF WHEN I'M

04:11:32.811 --> 04:11:34.412
LOOKING AT MY ITEMS WHICH I PUT

IN THE GREEN BIN WHAT I WHAT I

04:11:36.548 --> 04:11:38.016
USE IN OUR OWN HOME COMPOSTING.

04:11:38.082 --> 04:11:39.751
WHAT I THROW IN THE TRASH WHEN I

04:11:39.818 --> 04:11:41.219
PUT RECYCLING SENATORS

04:11:41.286 --> 04:11:41.853
INCREDIBLY CONFUSING SO WE'RE-

STAKEHOLDERS TO GET THIS RIGHT.

04:11:44.355 --> 04:11:44.856
THIS MEANS GETTING STANDARD

04:11:44.923 --> 04:11:46.291
RIGHT ALSO MEANS ENSURING THAT

MEMBERS NICK OFFICE OF

04:17:31.903 --> 04:17:33.771
CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. WE

04:17:33.838 --> 04:17:35.439
DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE

04:17:35.506 --> 04:17:37.408
BILL AS WRITTEN AND THAT IS

04:17:37.475 --> 04:17:39.043
LARGELY DUE TO THE AUTHORS

04:17:39.110 --> 04:17:40.945
COMMITMENT TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE

04:17:41.012 --> 04:17:42.914
AND TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS. WE

04:17:42.980 --> 04:17:46.017
WOULD HAVE CONCERNS WITH WITH-

04:17:46.083 --> 04:17:47.685
THE STANDARDS REFERENCED IN THE

04:17:47.752 --> 04:17:48.853
BILL BEING PUT BACK INTO

04:17:48.920 --> 04:17:50.555
STATUTE. THEY WERE TAKEN OUT OF

04:17:50.621 --> 04:17:53.024
STATUTE A COUPLE YEARS AGO-

04:17:53.090 --> 04:17:54.725
BECAUSE THEY WERE WITHDRAWN FROM

04:17:54.792 --> 04:17:56.227
ASTM AND THEY WERE WITHDRAWN

04:17:56.294 --> 04:17:58.429
FROM ACM. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT

04:17:58.496 --> 04:18:00.531
REPRESENT REAL WORLD CONDITIONS.

04:18:00.598 --> 04:18:03.267
AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DONE A

04:18:03.334 --> 04:18:05.903
LOT OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES TO

04:18:05.970 --> 04:18:07.505
REALLY LEAD ON GREENWASHING.

04:18:07.572 --> 04:18:09.040
CLAIMS AND MARK ENVIRONMENTAL

04:18:09.106 --> 04:18:10.975
MARKETING CLAIMS. AND THIS IS

04:18:11.042 --> 04:18:12.243
ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE

04:18:12.310 --> 04:18:14.245
CALIFORNIA'S LIED OR WE HAVE

04:18:14.312 --> 04:18:17.448
ADOPTED I BELIEVE A HALF DOZEN

04:18:17.515 --> 04:18:18.916
BILLS LIMITING WHAT CAN BE

04:18:18.983 --> 04:18:20.785
CALLED. COMPOSTABLE

04:18:20.852 --> 04:18:21.619
BIODEGRADABLE MARINE

04:18:21.686 --> 04:18:23.654
BIODEGRADABLE AND THE SPECIFIC

04:18:23.721 --> 04:18:25.690
STANDARD WAS WITHDRAWN AND

04:18:25.756 --> 04:18:29.560
LEGISLATION A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

04:18:29.627 --> 04:18:30.928
FOR THAT REASON. I'M YOU KNOW

04:18:30.995 --> 04:18:35.333
THIS IS NOT. THIS IS NOT EIGHT

04:18:35.399 --> 04:18:37.668
EIGHT EASY ISSUE BECAUSE AS THE

04:18:37.735 --> 04:18:39.737
SPONSORS I MENTIONED- THERE IS A

04:18:39.804 --> 04:18:43.307
NEED FOR SOME- STANDARDS HERE.

04:18:43.374 --> 04:18:44.675
THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE NOT AWARE

04:18:44.742 --> 04:18:45.910
OF ANY STANDARDS THAT REALLY

04:18:45.977 --> 04:18:47.845
REFLECT REAL LIFE CONDITIONS IN

04:18:47.912 --> 04:18:51.115
CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN CONSUMERS

04:18:51.182 --> 04:18:52.183
SEE THAT SOMETHING'S LABELS BY

04:18:52.250 --> 04:18:54.051
TWO GREAT OF ALL. THEY NOT ONLY

04:18:54.118 --> 04:18:55.920
INTERPRET AS A CHARACTERISTIC OF

04:18:55.987 --> 04:18:58.122
THE PRODUCT THEY ALSO INTERPRET

04:18:58.189 --> 04:19:00.958
AS INSTRUCTION FOR WHAT BEEN TO

04:19:01.025 --> 04:19:02.260
PUT THE PRODUCT IN. AND

04:19:02.326 --> 04:19:04.128
CALIFORNIA COMPOSTERS DO NOT

04:19:04.195 --> 04:19:05.096
ACCEPT THESE MATERIALS

04:19:05.162 --> 04:19:07.932
CURRENTLY- BUT EVEN IF THEY DID

04:19:07.999 --> 04:19:09.600
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY

04:19:09.667 --> 04:19:15.206
STANDARD IS NARROW IN SCOPE. TO-

04:19:15.273 --> 04:19:17.975
NOT ALLOW OTHER PRODUCTS THAT

04:19:18.042 --> 04:19:18.876
ARE NOT PHD PRODUCTS FOR

04:19:18.943 --> 04:19:21.412
INSTANCE- TO BE LABELED WITH

04:19:21.479 --> 04:19:23.581
THESE TERMS. AND THEN BEYOND THE

04:19:23.648 --> 04:19:25.650
DIRECTION CONSUMERS IT'S ALSO

04:19:25.716 --> 04:19:27.585
MARKETING CLAIM RIGHT AT PEOPLE

04:19:27.652 --> 04:19:28.886
CHOOSE SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY

04:19:28.953 --> 04:19:30.321
THINK IT'S BETTER FOR THE

04:19:30.388 --> 04:19:31.722
ENVIRONMENT. IF THERE'S NO

04:19:31.789 --> 04:19:34.058
ACTIVE STANDARD THAT YOU CAN GO

04:19:34.125 --> 04:19:37.228
PASS OR FAIL. IT OPENS A HUGE

04:19:37.295 --> 04:19:38.896
LOOPHOLE FOR OTHER FOLKS ALSO

04:19:38.963 --> 04:19:41.766
USE THE SAME TERMINOLOGY. AND

04:19:41.832 --> 04:19:44.835

04:19:44.902 --> 04:19:45.803

USE OF THAT. OF THAT TERM

04:21:06.951 --> 04:21:08.619

ASSOCIATED WITH IT. AND THIS IS

04:21:39.483 --> 04:21:41.318
THE REASON WHY BIODEGRADABLE WAS

04:21:41.385 --> 04:21:43.954
