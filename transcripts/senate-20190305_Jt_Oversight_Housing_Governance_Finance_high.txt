SENATOR MIKE MCGUIRE THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE -- AND THIS IS A JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING BETWEEN THE TWO TO COMMITTEES -- ABOUT ENTITLED ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING SHORTAGE HOW CAN WE CREATE ENVIRONMENTS TO FACILITATE HOUSING -- DEVELOPMENT ODD FOR START IF I COULD ASK EVERYONE TO TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONE AND IF YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS TO ENGAGE IN PLEASE STEP OUTSIDE. SO THAT WE CAN HEAR THE TESTIMONY -- THE HEARING WILL CONSIST OF THREE PANELS -- TO GO OVER -- FIRST -- CURRENT LOCAL ZONING AND PLANNING PROCESS SEES -- THEN THE STATE PLANNING REQUIRE ME TO FACILITATE THE CREATION OF HOUSING. AFTER EACH PANEL MEMBERS WHO WILL BE I THINK GRADUALLY JOINING US -- WILL -- BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS IN THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WILL BE ABLE TO GET PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END. OF PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE TWO MINUTES PER SPEAKER -- SO -- WHAT WE DECIDED TO HAVE THIS HEARING AS WE -- START OFF OUR LEGISLATIVE -- YEAR -- WE'RE AT THE NOW THE AND THE BILL INTRODUCTIONS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF HOUSING BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. ON AND YOU KNOW WE ARE -- I THINK IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO ANYONE THAT -- IN CALIFORNIA WE FACE A IT'S BEEN CALLED A HOUSING -- SHORTAGE ALL OF THESE THINGS ON OUR TRUE WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL IT -- AND WE USE A LOT OF TACTICAL -- TERMS LIKE ZONING AND SEQUEL -- AND CONDITIONAL USE AND BELOW MARKET RATE HOUSING AND SO ON AND SO FORTH -- I ALWAYS LIKE TO TRY -- TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE -- NOT IN TERMS OF THE TECHNICALITIES -- BUT IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN IMPACTS OF THE HOUSING CHOICES THAT WE MADE IN CALIFORNIA -- OVER DECADES WE HAVE ACCUMULATED A THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOME HOUSING DEFICIT. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS APPROX THAT OF THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES ARE COMBINED -- WE ARE TOLD BY OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S THAT WE ARE ARE PRETTY CONSISTENTLY -- PRODUCING EITHER SLIGHTLY LESS THAN HALF FOR SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF THE HOUSING THAT WE NEED TO PRODUCE IN CALIFORNIA JUST TO KEEP UP WITH GROWTH -- AND THE IMPACTS ARE -- ARE ARE TRAGIC -- OR HOMELESS -- HOUSING SHORTAGE IS DRIVING PEOPLE INTO HOMELESSNESS IT IS -- PERHAPS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF POVERTY -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LARA IS PUSHING FAMILIES OUT OF COMMUNITIES CREATING SUPER COMMUTERS WHO DRIVE AN HOUR AND A HALF TWO HOURS EACH WAY TO WORK. UNDERMINING OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND CLOGGING OUR FREEWAYS -- AND IT THIS IS -- YOU KNOW WE WE SEE ECONOMIC DAMAGE IN SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE RESTAURANTS THAT ARE CLOSING DOWN. NOT FOR LACK OF BUSINESS BUT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T HOW STATEWIDE USED TO BE VIEWED AS JUST A FEW -- CITIES HERE IN THERE THAT WERE REALLY HAVING MAJOR PROBLEMS IT'S A PROBLEM AND THE BOOK OF CALIFORNIA -- AND WE NEED -- TO REALLY TAKE BOLD STEPS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A THAT WE'RE BUILDING AT ALL INCOME LEVELS AND AND AND IN MY VIEW THAT WE'RE PROTECTING -- TENANTS FROM EVICTION. SO WITH THAT I WILL DIE TURNED OVER TO CENTER MCGUIRE FOR OPENING REMARKS AND THEN WE'LL GET TO OUR FIRST PANEL. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER WINNER I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO YOURSELF IN YOUR TEAM UP FOR THE PARTNERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL HEARING -- WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE PARTNER WITH YOU SIR. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE HOUSING COMMITTEE IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST -- IT WOULD WERE WE WERE DISCUSSING HOW HOW TO ADDRESS IT THROUGH FURTHER STATE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO WORK FORCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OUR SECOND HEARING FOCUS ON LAND USE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO ENABLE ADDITIONAL FOUR DOUBLE AND MARKET RATE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. IN HERE TODAY FOCUS ON ZONING AND PLANNING REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW. AFTER THE SERIES OF MEETINGS IN HEARINGS WE POSTED OVER THE LAST MANY MONTHS CALIFORNIA IS FACED WITH A SERIES OF COMPLEX CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILD OUT OF HOUSING. HIGHLAND PRICES. THE LACK OF HOUSING SOCCER ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAN. THE LACK OF ONGOING SUSTAINABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING REVENUE. REGULATORY HURDLES HI CASA SO SHE WOULD PERMITTING AND YES OWNING AN INABILITY IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THE BILL STRATEGIC INFILL HOUSE. IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME TO BE ABLE TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THE SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT THAT'S FACING US. AND WE MUST HAVE A LASER FOCUS ON THE BUILD OUT OF WORK FORCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL. THIS IS WHY I FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE. THE TRUE CRISIS EXISTS WITH THE WORKING POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE'RE SHORT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AFFORDABLE UNITS. ACROSS THE STATE WITHIN THOSE THREE AFFORDABLE RINA CATEGORIES. EVERY CITY IN COUNTY IN THE GOLDEN STATE MUST DO THEIR PART. AND CANDIDLY THE STRATEGY OF NO NO LONGER WORKS. IT'S TIME TO STEP UP. IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO HELP YOU STAND STRONG. THAT'S WHY THE STATE NEEDS TO DEVELOP A PERMANENT REVENUE SOURCE TO HELP SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN. I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S GONNA WE'RE GONNA NEED MEASURES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE DIFFERENCES OF JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE THEY BLANK. BLANK IT ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK WITH THAT AGAIN CENTER WIENER I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE WORKING WITH YOU SIR. AN ALTERNATE OVER TO FOR THE FIRST. THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE I'M SORRY FIRST PANEL IS ENTITLED THE IMPACTS ON HOUSING OF ZONING AND THE APPROVAL PROCESS. WE HAVE FOUR WITNESSES -- DAN RENSSELAER THE SENIOR POLICY HOUSING PARTNERSHIP CORPORATION. I DAVID GARCIA WHO IS A PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE UC BERKELEY -- TURNER CENTER -- TO MAKE A MÃ¡S THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF HAMILTON FAMILIES -- AND CAROLINE COLEMAN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES -- SO THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY -- WITH -- ASSET IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR PRESENTATION TO ABOUT FIVE MINUTES OR SO -- THAT WOULD BE A GREAT -- SO -- WE WILL GO IN THE ORDER I JUST STATED SO MISTER RENTS ARE YOU CAN START. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US -- AND HAVING ME -- YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY WITH THIS MY US GREAT. ON PAPER TO JUST A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THE STANDARDS ARE NOW. RATES -- SO. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS DAN RENSSELAER AND I'M A SENIOR POLICY ANALYST AT THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. WE WERE CREATED THIRTY YEARS AGO BY THE STATE ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT RECEIVE ANY ONGOING STATE FUNDING. OUR STAFF HAS HELPED PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT HOUSING AGENCIES LEVERAGE EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN FINANCING AND CREATE SEVENTY THOUSAND FOUR WILL HOMES FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. WE ALSO PROVIDE RESEARCH AND LEADERSHIP ON HOUSING POLICY ISSUES. SO MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE WAY THAT REDLINING RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND OTHER EXPLICITLY RACIST POLICIES IN THE POST WAR ERA CREATED AN ENTRENCHED. RACIALLY SEGREGATED GEOGRAPHY OF OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHERE YOUR RACE DETERMINE THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE YOU LIVED THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AVAILABLE TO YOU? AND THE RESOURCES THE HAVE ACCESS TO IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. IN PART OF THE LEGACY OF THESE POLICIES HAS BEEN AN UNEVEN GEOGRAPHY OF OPPORTUNITY WITHIN METROPOLITAN AREAS WHERE YOUR CHILDHOOD NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DETERMINING YOUR LONG TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS. IN EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS EVEN YOUR PHYSICAL MENTAL HEALTH -- IN THIS MAP OF LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY CHILDREN WHO LIVED IN AREAS SEATED BLUE TENDED TO MOVE UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER AS ADULTS BUT THOSE WHO GREW UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SEATED READ DID NOT. WE ALSO KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE BAY AREA AT THAT RACE CONTINUES TO PLAY A LARGER ROLE THAN INCOME IN DETERMINING WHO HAS ACCESS TO HIGH RESOURCE HIGH OPPORTUNITY NEIGHBORHOODS. SO LOW INCOME WHITE FAMILIES ENJOY DECENT ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF NEIGHBORHOODS AS THEY SHOULD -- BUT LOW INCOME BLACK AND LET NEXT DO NOT -- EVEN HIGHER -- TO MODERATE TO HIGHER INCOME BLACK FAMILIES JUST ARE TYPICALLY LIVE IN HIGHER POVERTY LOW RESOURCE NEIGHBORHOODS WEATHER PROSPECTS SIMPLY JUST AREN'T AS GOOD. WE ALSO KNOW FROM SURVEY DATA THAT THESE PATTERNS OF SEGREGATION DO NOT REFLECT THE ACTUAL LOCATION PREFERENCES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR -- DAY TYPICALLY END UP LIVING IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE MORE SEGREGATED THAN WHERE THEY SAY THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN WHERE THEY ACTUALLY SEARCH FOR HOUSING. IN WHAT WE AT THE CALIFORNIA HAVING HOUSING PARTNERSHIP HAVE OBSERVED THROUGH A STUDY WITH THE URBAN DISPLACEMENT PROJECT AT UC BERKELEY IS THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AS RENTAL HOUSING PRICES HAVE SKYROCKETED. THIS OLD GEOGRAPHY OF SEGREGATION IN THE BAY AREA HAS -- SORT OF RESTRUCTURED AND RESHUFFLE BUT NOT BROKEN DOWN ON CENSUS DATA SHOWS THAT CONCENTRATED INCREASES INDIAN DECREASES AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR HAPPENED IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS FALL COMPLETELY BY PASSING PREDOMINANTLY WHITE. IN HIGHER INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS SO THIS PARTICULAR MAP SHOWS. INCREASES AND DECREASES AND LOW INCOME BLACK HOUSEHOLDS PURPLE IS A DECREASE GREEN AS AN INCREASE. WE ALSO FOUND THAT AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE MORE VULNERABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF RENT INCREASES AND WERE DISPLACED AT HIGHER RATES. SO IN THE FIFTEEN YEAR PERIOD FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWENTY FIFTEEN A 30% RISE IN RENTS AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 20% DROP IN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR. BUT NO CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF LONGER MIGHT HOUSEHOLDS WHO APPEAR TO BE MUCH MORE RESILIENT TO THE VAGARIES OF THE RENTAL MARKET. DURING THE SAME PERIOD THE LANDSCAPE OF HIGH POVERTY RACIALLY SEGREGATED NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE REGION ALSO SHIFTED INTO NEW PARTS OF THE REGION. BUT THESE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS WERE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES TYPICALLY FACE GREATER CHALLENGES -- MOVING UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER GETTING A CALL. IN IN THESE MAPS AREAS THAT NEWLY MET THIS DEFINITION IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ARE SHOWN AND CROSS HATCH -- AREAS THAT WERE ALREADY POOR IN SEGREGATED IN TWO THOUSAND ARE SHOWN IN ORANGE. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT MOST OF THE MAP IS WHITE. MOST NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE BAY AREA ARE NOT CHARACTERIZED BY A RACIAL SEGREGATION AND POVERTY IT'S A PRETTY RARE PHENOMENON. BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT ONCE THIS PLACE LOW INCOME FAMILIES OF COLOR OFTEN FOUND THEMSELVES MOVING TO THESE NEWLY POOR ANNUALLY SEGREGATED NEIGHBORHOODS. OFTEN ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE REGION. AND ALSO THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR BLACK AND LET NEXT HOUSEHOLDS WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS BEEN LOW INCOME MY HOUSEHOLD SO. IF YOU'RE BLACK AND LOW INCOME IN THE BAY AREA YOUR MOM MORE THAN LIKELY TO LIVE IN A HIGH NEIGHBORHOOD IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME AND WHY. LESS THAN 10% LIKELIHOOD OF LIVING IN ONE OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS. WE ALSO ASKED WHO GETS TO LIVE IN HIGH RESOURCE HI OPPORTUNITY NEIGHBORHOODS WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS ARE MORE STRONGLY PREDICTIVE OF UPWARD MOBILITY IN GOOD EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR LOW INCOME CHILDREN. USER AREAS THAT ARE SHOWN IN THE DARKER GREEN COLOR IN THE THREE COUNTY LEVEL MAPS THE BAY AREA. AND AGAIN THE RESULTS FALL LARGELY FALLEN RACIAL LINES LOW INCOME WHITE HOUSEHOLDS ARE SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN HIGH RESOURCE NEIGHBORHOODS THAN EVEN MODERATE TO HIGH INCOME BLACK HOUSEHOLDS SIMILAR DISPARITIES BETWEEN WHITE LATIN X. HOUSEHOLDS IN THE BAY AREA. SO THESE RESULTS ARE WHICH WE WOULD PROBABLY EXPECT TO SEE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE OR PART OF THE LEGACY OF MORE EXPLICITLY RACIST POST WAR -- HOUSING AND LAND USE PLANNING POLICIES THAT LIVE ON TODAY JUSTIN RECONFIGURED FORMS -- THEIR DEEP RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT PROBABLY WON'T GET FIXED WITHOUT DELIBERATE STATE AND LOCAL. POLICIES IN INVESTMENTS WHICH AFFIRMATIVELY HELP LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR LIVE IN ANY NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN THAT THEY DESIRE DISPARITIES IN RESOURCES ACROSS NEIGHBORHOODS. THERE ARE THREE WAYS THAT -- AT A HIGH LEVEL THE STATE CAN TRY TO BRING THIS INTO ACTION FIRST CREATE NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES AND HIGH OPPORTUNITY HIGH RESOURCE NEIGHBORHOODS. WHETHER SUBSIDIZED OR THROUGH AN INCLUSIONARY POLICY. SECOND STABILIZE HOUSING PRICES BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PROTECTING INS AND NEIGHBORHOODS WERE RENTS ARE RISING THE FASTEST WHICH FOR A LOT OF PLACES BUT NOT EVERYWHERE. IN THIRD DIRECT INVESTMENT -- IN SUPPORT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN HIGH POVERTY RACIALLY SEGREGATED NEIGHBORHOODS INCLUDING THOSE EXPERIENCING THESE DYNAMICS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT -- I COMPOSED FOR QUESTIONS ARE PASSED ON TO THE NEXT BAKER. WHAT DO QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL OKAY? TAKE A MOMENT TO PULL OF MYSELF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA AND THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION AT UC BERKELEY -- FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE WORK OF THE TURNER CENTER WE ARE A HOUSING RESEARCH AND POLICY ORGANIZATION AT THE BERKLEE COLLEGE OF OUR MENTAL DESIGN AS WELL AS THE HOUSE. SCHOOL OF BUSINESS. AND SO I'VE BEEN ASKED HERE THIS AFTERNOON TO PRESENT SOME OF THE FINDINGS OF OUR RECENT CALIFORNIA LAND YOU SURVEY. A SPECIFICALLY REGARDING ZONING ISSUES AND OTHER BARRIERS TO HOUSING PRODUCTION AND SO -- THE TURNER CENTER LAND USE SURVEY WAS A MULTI YEAR EFFORTS TO CATALOG THE LANDSCAPE. OF ZONING PRACTICES AND LAND USE PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE BY SURVEYING LOCAL PLANNING DEPARTMENTS ON THE RESULTS FROM THE SURVEY CAN GIVE US UNIQUE INSIGHTS INTO THE VARIOUS. ZONING ORDINANCES FOR THE HOUSING PROGRAMS APPROVAL PROCESS SEES AND IT'S AN OBJECTION POLICIES THAT IS EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND CAN HELP US IDENTIFY POLICY BARRIERS THAT HINDER THE PRODUCTION OF NEW HOUSING. AND SO OUR WORK BILLS OFF PREVIOUS SURVEYS THAT EXAMINE SIMILAR TOPICS SUCH AS THE BROOKINGS RESIDENTIAL LAND USE REGULATIONS SURVEY AND THE WHARTON. LAND USE SURVEY. WE ALSO WORKED WITH H. C. D. TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE AREAS THAT WOULD BE THE MOST USEFUL AND LINING TO UNDERSTANDING. LAND USE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND OUR SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED ONLINE. AND WE RECEIVED RESPONSES BETWEEN AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND OCTOBER. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS YOU CAN SEE HERE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE JURISDICTIONS TO PARTNER SURVEY ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT 70% OF THE STATE'S OVERALL POPULATION. AND ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING FINDINGS REGARDING ZONING FROM OUR SERVER WAS JUST THE SHEER AMOUNT OF LAND. THAT ALLOWS FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES TO BE BUILT. SO AS YOU CAN SEE HERE OVER 70% OF ZONE LAND IN CALIFORNIA ACCORDING TO OUR SURVEY. ALLOWS FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOME BUILDING WHEREAS ALL OF THE LAND IS OWNED FOR MULTI FAMILY. BUILDINGS -- COMPRISES LESS THAN A QUARTER LANDON AND THIS IS NOT JUST -- CHARACTERISTIC OF SMALLER SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES WE ACTUALLY FOUND THAT ARE LARGER CITIES SUCH AS LOS ANGELES SAN JOSE SAN DIEGO THE REPORTED TO US IN IN OUR SURVEY THAT. UNDER A QUARTER OF THEIR LANDS ON FOR MULTI FAMILY AS WELL. WE ALSO KNOW THAT -- THE TIME IT TAKES TO APPROVE A PROJECT IS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN WHETHER NOT HOUSING GETS BUILT SO TO THAT END WE ALSO ASKED A QUESTION -- UP TO THE PLANNERS ABOUT HOW LONG IT ACTUALLY TAKES HIM TO PROVE HOUSING AND BY LARGE WE SEE THAT NGUYEN PROJECTS AT HERE TO EXISTING REGULATIONS AS DETERMINED BY GENERAL PLAN. OR OR ZONING CITIES MOSTLY CAN APPROVE PROJECTS WITHIN SIX MONTHS HOWEVER AS PROJECTS REQUIRE ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF APPROVAL OR REQUEST -- ZONING VARIANCES -- AND OR IF THEY REQUIRE ENVIRONMENT IMPACT PORT PERCY CLUB. THE NUMBER OF CITIES THAT REPORTED -- THEIR ABILITY TO APPROVE PROJECTS WITHIN SIX MONTHS ACTUALLY FALLS PRETTY LOW. AND WE KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MOST PROJECTS FOR MANY PROJECTS TO REQUIRE HE A OURS AND MANY OTHER PROJECTS ALSO ROUTINELY WILL REQUEST VARIANCES. FOR FOR FOR MANY MANY PURPOSES TO GET A PROJECT FEASIBILITY. AND SO TO THAT LAST POINT WE ALSO ASKED PLANNERS ABOUT THE TYPES OF VARIANCES IN EXCEPTIONS THAT THEY SEE. AND AS ILLUSTRATED HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THINGS LIKESET BACKS WANT COVERAGE -- FAIRLY COMMON FOR BOTH SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS -- WE CAN ALSO SEE THAT'S MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS -- CAN COMMONLY REQUEST THINGS -- VARIANCES FOR PARKING HEIGHTS -- RESTRICTIONS AND FOR DENSITY AS WELL. IN ADDITION TO THEIR EXISTING ZONING WE ASK CITIES WHETHER OR NOT THEIR ZONING REGULATIONS HAVE BECOME MORE OR LESS RESTRICTIVE IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. AND ENCOURAGINGLY. OVER 50% SAY THAT TO THERE'S ONLY HAS BECOME LESS RESTRICTIVE AND ANECDOTALLY THIS SEEMS RIGHT BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY CITIES THAT ARE ACTING PRACTICALLY TO TRY. AND REDUCE BARRIERS -- TO HOME -- CONSTRUCTION IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ON THE OTHER HAND WE ALSO HAVE OVER 40% OF COMMUNITIES IS SAY THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND A HANDFUL COMMUNITIES THAT ACTUALLY SAY THAT THEIR ZONING REGULATIONS HAVE BECOME MORE RESTRICTIVE. IN ADDITION. TO EXISTING PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THAT CITIES EMPLOY WE ASK PLANNERS AS WELL WHAT DID THEY THINK WERE THE MOST SEVERE CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. AND THE RESULTS WERE A BIT SURPRISING ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE CONVERSATION AROUND HOUSING TENDS TO REVOLVE AROUND THINGS LIKE SELLING SEQUEL A FEES THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT ACCORDING TO THE PLANNERS WHO RESPONDED TO OUR SURVEY THOSE ISSUES WERE ACTUALLY RANG TO TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OR AS OTHER THINGS SUCH AS LAND SUPPLY PERSONAL CONFIGURATION LANDOWNERSHIP -- WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE AS THE MOST SEVERE CONSTRAINTS. AND SO -- I'M GONNA LEAVE IT THERE WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER INFORMATION WITH REGARDS TO FROM HOUSING POLICIES. AND PROTECTIONS -- AND SO ON SO I IN OUR WORK TO VISIT THE PROJECT WEBSITE WHICH IS CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU SAID ORG. WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ARE DESCRIPTIVE REPORTS AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY DOWNLOAD THE DATA YOURSELF SO -- WITH THAT LIKE TO THINK MEGAN FOR HAVING THE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS MOSS. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY. MY NAME IS TO MICAH MÃ¡S AND I'M THE CEO OF HAMILTON FAMILIES. AYE HAMILTON FAMILIES AS A THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS -- TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY TRANSITIONAL AND PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS FOR FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. SO I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PEOPLE -- YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THIS CRISIS LOOK LIKE FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR OF OUR STATE -- WE STAND TO LOSE THE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT ACTUALLY HELP TO BUILD THIS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF WE STAND ON THE SIDELINES AND NOT TAKE THIS HOUSING CRISIS SERIOUSLY. WITH RAPID JOB GROWTH. GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY AND THE SEVERE UNDER PRODUCTION THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT -- IN HOUSING ACROSS ALL ECONOMIC LEVELS IT THREATENS THE VERY DIVERSITY OF THIS REGION. AND WE MUST ACT NOW. AND IT TAKES NOT ONLY ACTION BUT THE POLITICAL WILL TO TAKE ACTION. YOU KNOW I OFTEN AM IN CONVERSATION WITH FOLKS ABOUT HOUSING AND WE TALK ABOUT IT IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT OUR PROGRESSIVE VALUES. AROUND INCLUSION IN THE CELEBRATION OF THAT DIVERSITY THAT CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON BUT IF WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY WILLING TO ACT IN SUPPORT HOUSING POLICIES THAT FACILITATE THAT VERY INCLUSION. AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE RACIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY INTEGRATED COMMUNITIES. THAT OFFER PROSPERITY FOR ALL THEN WE ARE COLLECTIVELY NOT DOING OUR JOBS. I'M INVOLUNTARY DISPLACEMENT IS HAPPENING EVERYWHERE IN OUR STATE. AND IT'S IT'S SPECIALLY HAPPENING FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE OUTLINED IN THEIR PRESENTATIONS. I WAS A MEMBER OF THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE THAT WORKED ON CASA. AND WE PAID A LOT OF ATTENTION AROUND WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO FOR THE TENANTS WHO ARE BEING WHO ARE ATRISK OF DISPLACEMENT RIGHT NOW. WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR FOLKS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND HOW DO WE HOUSE THE BAY AREA OF THE FUTURE? SO THE CASA QUE ELEMENTS THAT WE DESCRIBED AROUND OUR TENANT PROTECTIONS -- ARE JUST TO START AND HOW WE THINK THE STATE NEEDS TO TAKE LEADERSHIP AROUND MAKING SURE THAT EXISTING TENANTS AND RESIDENTS ARE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ARE JUST BECAUSE OF DICTION POLICY. A BASE LINE POLICY THAT MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED THAT WE THINK WILL ALLOW FOR THOSE PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES. WE TALK ABOUT RENT CAPS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN RENTS GO UP 20% IN A IN A IN A ONE BEDROOM UNIT IN THAT PERSON IS DISPLACED. WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. WE ALSO TALK ABOUT RENT ASSISTANCE AND ACCESS TO LEGAL COUNSEL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN IT WHEN A PERSON IS EXPERIENCING AN EVICTION PROCESS TO HAVE ACCESS TO COUNSEL ACTUALLY PREVENTS THEM FROM COMING INTO MY PROGRAM WITH THE VISIONS ON THE RECORDS. SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE DECISION MATERS DECISION MAKERS LIKE YOURSELVES CAN TAKE AN OWN AND WE KNOW THE PRODUCTION IS IMPORTANT WE HAVE GOT TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF WRAPPING THAT PRODUCTION GOALS AROUND TEN AND PROTECTIONS AND PRESERVATION TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW LAND USES VERY LOCAL AND IT'S PERSONAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT WE CANNOT PROMOTE THE STATUS QUO I THINK SENATOR YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW NO WAS NO LONGER PART OF THE SOLUTION WE MUST BE ABLE TO BE COURAGEOUS AND SAY YES TO HOUSING. EVERYONE IN THIS STATE DOES DESERVE AFFORDABLE PLACE THAT THEY CAN LIVE. WE HAVE TO EMBRACE INCLUSIONARY ZONING THAT CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOUSING TO BE BUILT NOT ONLY TO ACCOMMODATE THE THE FAILURE OF GROWTH. WELL THE FAILURE OF HOUSING PRODUCTION IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT WE MUST ALSO MAKE SURE THAT OUR EXISTING RESIDENTS ARE ABLE TO STAY HOUSE. THE URGENCY IS REALLY NOW. EVERY DAY WHEN I WORK WITH FAMILIES IN OUR PROGRAMS FAMILIES THAT TAKE THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY. FAMILIES THAT GO TO WORK EVERY DAY AND THEN RETURN HOME TO MY SHELTER BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL HOMELESS IN THE BAY AREA. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CHANGE. THESE FAMILIES ARE INCREDIBLY RESILIENT. AND THEY'RE ADAPTABLE AND I ENCOURAGE US ALL AS LEADERS IN OUR COMMUNITY TO BE AT LEAST AS RESILIENT AS THEY ARE AND MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES AROUND HOUSING POLICIES THAT WE NO WORK WE HAVE THE DATA TO PROVE IT. AND WE JUST NEED TO HAVE THE COURAGEOUS LEADERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE THINGS HAPPEN I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE WITH YOU ALL TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS MOSS -- IS COMMON WELCOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WHICH IS A RESOURCE AND AN ADVOCATE FOR FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE CITIES. IN OUR STATE THERE REPRESENTING NEARLY THIRTY THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING LAWS HAVE CHANGED QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH OVER THIRTY NEW LAWS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE LOCAL PLANNING AND APPROVAL PROCESS. HOUSING SUPPLY IN AFFORDABILITY REMAIN CRITICAL ISSUES I DON'T NEED TO TELL OUR SAY THAT TO THIS COMMITTEE. A NO THAT CITIES ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO DO OUR PART TO INCREASE HOUSING SUPPLY. CITIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE THAT WE RECOGNIZE IN THE HOUSING PRODUCTION PROCESS BY SETTING THE TABLE SO THAT DEVELOPMENT CAN HAPPEN. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PLANNING FOR THE ZONING AND FOR THE APPROVAL OF HOUSING PROJECTS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE PLANS. NOW CITIES DON'T BUILD HOUSES BUT WE DO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PLANNING FOR AND APPROVING THE HOUSING OUR COMMUNITIES NEED WHILE MINIMIZING DELAYS COST AND BARRIERS TO THAT CONSTRUCTION. THE PLANNING PROCESS REALLY BEGINS WITH THE CREATION OF THE CITY'S GENERAL PLAN THIS IS% REALLY A BLUEPRINT FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL KINDS. AND ANY GOOD PLANNING PROCESS IN A COMMUNITY IS ONE THAT IS TRANSPARENT AND ONE THAT IS INCLUSIVE BY DESIGN WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC OUR RESIDENTS ARE BUSINESSES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO PROVIDE INPUT. THE GENERAL PLAN AND THE ASSOCIATED ELEMENTS ARE TRULY A COMMUNITIES VISION FOR THEIR FUTURE AM FOR THE PLACE THAT THEY CALL HOME. AND IN ANY COMMUNITY. RESIDENTS FEEL A GREAT SENSE OF OWNERSHIP OVER THE VISION THEY HAVE HELPED CREATE. AND I THINK THAT IS A GOOD THING AND IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVING THE VIBRANT COMMUNITIES THAT WE ALL WANT IN CALIFORNIA. BUT CITIES DON'T PLAN OR ZONE IN ISOLATION THE STATE IS AN ACTIVE PARTNER WITH CITIES STATE LAW AS YOU ALL KNOW REQUIRES EACH JURISDICTION TO ADOPT A GENERAL PLAN. INCLUDING A HOUSING ELEMENT THE STATE MANDATED PROCESS TO PLAN AND STONE WHERE ALL OF A JURISDICTIONS NEEDED HOUSING CAN ACTUALLY BE BUILT. THIS INCLUDES ALL TYPES OF HOUSING AND WE'VE HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANT NEED FOR THE SPECTRUM OF AFFORDABILITY FOR HOUSING. FOR MORE THAN 90% OF ALL CITIES HAVE A STATE CERTIFIED HOUSING ELEMENT. AND WE BELIEVE AS A LEADER CITIES THAT CITIES SHOULD BE MEETING THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LAW TO PLAN FOR HOUSING AND WE ARE WORKING WITH CITIES WHO ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE. AND PROVIDE SORT TO THEM AS WE CAN. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE AE UNIQUE FACTORS AND SENATOR MCGUIRE CHAIRMAN REQUIRE MENTIONED THIS EARLIER THERE ARE UNIQUE FACTORS IN PLAY AND MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES BETTER IMPACTING THE PLANNING PROCESS. IT COULD BE A LACK OF FUNDING TO HAVE THE PLANNERS ON STAFF -- TO FACILITATE THE ALSO BE LOCAL CITIZEN OPPOSITION OR IN SOME CASES EVEN LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES THAT ARE IMPOSED BY AND PASSED BY LOCAL CITIZENS WE APPRECIATE IT AT LEAST FOR THOSE CITIES WHO ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE LAW WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION. MEETING WITH THEM RECENTLY AND REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN HELP THEM GET INTO COMPLIANCE. ONE QUESTION I'M OFTEN ASKED I THINK AN EARLIER SPEAKER REFERENCE THIS IT HAD TO DO WITH LAND I'M ASKED WE HAVE ENOUGH LAND ZONED TO MEET OUR HOUSING NEEDS. WHEN THE RESEARCH BY UCLA'S LUSKIN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS REPORTS THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE ZONE TO LAND FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION HOMES? THIS INTO A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT HOME BUILDERS HAVE PRODUCED AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS PER YEAR OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. BY MY MATH THAT MEANS CALIFORNIA HAS ROUGHLY TWENTY EIGHT TIMES THE AMOUNT OF LAND ZONE FOR HOUSING. DÃ¢N IS BEING PRODUCED IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. ADDITIONALLY A TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC FORECAST LISTED MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND NEW HOMES. ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR PROVED TO BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION BUT BECAUSE OF FACTORS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF CITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THESE HOMES WILL ACTUALLY NOT BE BILLED FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS. IN THE PAST TWO YEARS THE LEAGUE IS STRONGLY SUPPORTED PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION. THAT STREAMLINES THE HOUSING APPROVAL PROCESS THIS INCLUDES SB FIVE FORTY IT ALSO INCLUDES AB. SEVENTY THREE THESE BILLS WHICH ARE NOW LAW ARE STILL IN THEIR INFANCY BUT WE'RE WORKING TO GET THEM IMPLEMENTED. THE LEAGUE ALSO SUPPORTED THE PASSAGE OF PROPS ONE AND TWO WHICH MEANS CITIES WILL FINALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HELP FIND THE MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUPPORT OF HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH YOU HEARD ABOUT. EARLIER AND ADDITIONALLY WITH THE WALKING OF A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS NEXT MONTH FROM SB TWO FUNDS THANK MANY OF YOU FOR THAT. A CITIES WILL HAVE GREATER RESOURCES TO SOURCES TO STREAMLINE THE APPROVAL PROCESS TO ACTUALLY UPDATE OUR LAND USE PLANS AND ZONE OR TO REZONE TO MEET THE HOUSING NEEDS. CITY IS WANT TO BE PARTNERS WITH THE STATE TO ACHIEVE OUR MUTUAL HOUSING GOALS WE SUPPORT A COLLABORATION WITH THE STATE WHERE THE STATE SETS GOALS AND PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR CITIES THROUGH FUNDING AND PERHAPS A TAX INCREMENTS. BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT FIRMLY AND ULTIMATELY. THAT THE AUTHORITY THE PLAN FOR AND HIS OWN AND APPROVE HOUSING RIGHTFULLY BELONGS IN THE HANDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE CLOSER TO THE GROUND AND CAN REFLECT THE INTEREST. OF THOSE WHO LIVE THERE. AND WE KNOW THAT THE VOTERS SUPPORT THAT PRINCIPLE AS WELL. I WANT IN MY REMARKS WERE TALKING A LITTLE BIT -- ABOUT WHAT WHAT CITY SUPPORT AS A PART OF THIS LARGER CONVERSATION WE ARE HAVING. BESIDES THE RESOURCES IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTING WAYS THE STATE CAN REDUCE LOCAL BARRIERS TO HOUSING LIKE SOME FORM A SEQUEL REFORM. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED SUSTAINABLE HOUSING INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT AND APPRECIATE -- CHAIRMAN REQUIRES AND SENATOR BELLS A LEADERSHIP AND JUMP STARTING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT A NEW FORM OF TAX INCREMENTAL FINANCING. WE ALSO SUPPORT LOOKING AT BUILDING FEES IF THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO FUND THE SERVICES AND AMENITIES THAT THESE THESE PAY. FOR THE LEAGUE IS OPEN TO HAVING THAT COMFORTED CONVERSATION. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE SOMEHOW REDUCE THAT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THEIR SAVINGS ARE PASSED ALONG TO THE BUYER. WE ALSO SUPPORT REASONABLE ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS AND PARKING REQUIREMENTS AND BELIEVE THAT NEW SUBDIVISIONS PLANNED BY CITIES AND DEVELOPERS SHOULD INCLUDE ZONING FOR MULTI FAMILY UNITS AND ACCESS FOR HOME BUYERS IN ALL INCOME RANGES. AND FINALLY THE LEAGUE SUPPORTS CITIES RECEIVING THE NEW TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THAT WE PROMISED TO VOTERS THAT THEY WOULD GET UNDER SB. ONE I WANT TO CLOSE MY REMARKS WITH A SOME COMMENTS ARE SOME WORDS THAT I'LL BORROW FROM -- HARVEY MILK MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THIS THE AMERICAN DREAM STARTS WITH THE NEIGHBORHOODS IF WE WISH TO REBUILD OUR CITIES WE MUST FIRST REBUILD OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME REMARKS TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- TO THE PANEL -- SO -- COLLEAGUES IS ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL OR COMMENTS [inaudible] CENTER MORLOCKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISSED RENSSELAER'S I'D LIKE TO START WITH YOU -- YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU HAD TO SEVENTY THOUSAND AFFORDABLE HOMES THAT YOU'VE CREATED ARE PRESERVED OVER THE LAST. SOME THIRTY ONE YEARS. NOT ME BUT YS -- I THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UNITS A YEAR I'M JUST CURIOUS. WHAT IS YOUR BEEN YOUR YEAR BY YEAR -- RESULTS I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I THINK -- AS THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM HAS GROWN OVER TIME. AND BECOME MORE -- THE MAINSTAY FUNDING SOURCE FOR ANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION -- PRESERVATION THE STATE. AND AS THE INDUSTRY HAS GROWN AROUND THAT OUR STAFF IN OUR ABILITY TO HELP DEVELOPERS AND LOCAL AGENCIES BUILD HOUSING IS GROWING OVER TIME SO IT'S LIKE IT'S BEEN A PRETTY STEADY INCREASE -- THERE CERTAINLY WAS A DROP OFF IN THE RECESSION BUT IT'S BASICALLY BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES -- SO YOU KNOW WE OUR OUR WORK BASICALLY FOLLOWS THAT YEAH INTO THEM WHAT'S BEEN THE SECRET TO YOUR SUCCESS YOU FINING LAND OR YOU JUST REHABILITATING. EXISTING PROPERTIES SO WE PROVIDE FINANCIAL CONSULTING -- AND WORK WITH DEVELOP NONPROFIT THESE AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO IDENTIFY THE LAND -- WE HELP THEM SORT OF A SYMBOL THE FINANCING NEGOTIATE WITH INVESTORS AND THAT KIND OF THING -- SO WE PLAY SORT OF DISCRETE ROLE IN THAT VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN PARTICULAR. AND THEN -- ON PAGE. THIRTEEN OF YOUR PRESENTATION. FOR THE FAR RIGHT. A WRY PART THE LOW INCOME AND MODERATE HI INCOME -- EIGHT EIGHT FOR FOR BLACKS IS THAT WAITED. IN OTHER WORDS. IS JUSTICE JUST REFLECT THE THE BLACK POPULATION OR IF. THE BLACK POPULATION IS SAY 8% OF THE POPULATION WOULD CHANGE. THE NUMBERS I JUST. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I WHAT I YEAH -- SO THE THIS IS A SHARE OF TOTAL SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SO SO YES TYPICALLY -- BLACK HOUSEHOLDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE LOW INCOME DUE TO DECADES OF DISCRIMINATION AND ALL KINDS OF FACTORS LIKE THAT -- BUT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT WITHIN THE UNIVERSE OF MODERATE TO HANG COMPLY COUNCILS IN THE BAY AREA -- WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR TOTAL NUMBERS WHERE THEY LEFT. AND THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN POOR. SEGREGATED LOW RESOURCE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE BAY AREA MUCH. MUCH MORE SO THAN EVEN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS [inaudible] AND THEN. THANK YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR GARCIA BUT I HAVE MISSED IT SO MISTER CARROLL. THANK YOU CENTER MELAKA CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU AND WHILE I WASN'T IN THE ROOM I WAS LISTENING TO THE HEARING. DEALING WITH SOME THINGS I HAD TO SIGN. SO I HAVE A QUESTION FORMR INSULAR BECAUSE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RED LINING AND OTHER POLICIES THAT HAVE -- RACIALLY IMPACTED OUR HAVE AFFECTED THE SEGREGATION IN THE RACIAL AM OPPORTUNITIES IN DISPARITIES IN OUR HOUSING. COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW ZONING HAS -- IN AFFECTED THAT. YEAH WELL WE WE DID NOT INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF ZONING AND OUR I TRY TO GET TO THE SIDE. IN OUR ANALYSIS BUT YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THE THE AREAS THAT ARE NOT -- RACIALLY SEGREGATED IN HIGH POVERTY ARE TYPICALLY WIDER -- LOWER DENSITIES OWNED AREAS AND SO THEY'VE. ONE OF THE TOOLS THEY HAVE USED TO ALLOW -- TO BLOCK CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE FROM LIVING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES HAS BEEN ZONING AND SO WHEN WE HAVE HOUSING RICES RISING IN THE URBAN CORE. AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE DISPLACED THEY'RE THEY'RE SORT OF BY PASSING THOSE -- SINGLE FAMILIES ON HIGHER INCOME AREAS AND ENDING UP THE URBAN PERIPHERY WHICH YOU CAN KIND OF SEE AN IN THIS SHIFTING LANDSCAPE OF WHERE LONGER PEOPLE OF COLOR LIVE IN THE BAY AREA -- AND AND THIS PART I DIDN'T HEAR IF ANYONE HAD REFERENCE BUT DID ANYONE REFERENCE THE RECENT -- REPORT THAT SHOWS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN BANKS WERE EXAMINED FOR LOANS AND THIS IS JUST IN THE LAST. TWO TO FOUR YEARS. IN EVERY MAJOR CITY IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. YOUR ABILITY TO GET A LOAN. WAS IT INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER FACTORS OF INCOME CREDIT SCORE. WERE WAS IMPACTED ON THE BASIS OF YOUR RACE AND IF YOU WERE BLACK. YOUR AT YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF THE LOAN. DROPPED BY A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE POINT. DID ANYONE NINE REFERENCE THAT STUDY. WE DIDN'T BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THAT VERY MUCH MIRRORS OUR FINDINGS THAT RACE SEEMS TO BE A MUCH MORE POWERFUL FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHAT YOU HAVE ACCESS. TO THEN INCOME -- AND I THINK THAT IT IT IT. WHOSE US TO TALK MORE ABOUT RACE EXPLICITLY AND HOUSING AND LAND USE POLICY. THANK YOU. KNOW CLEARLY ARE HEARING TODAY IS ABOUT THE HOUSING -- SERVE EMERGENCY CALIFORNIA'S SAN. BUT I RAISE THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS IT. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A CAREFUL LENS SO THAT WE IN ADDRESSING IT DON'T EXACERBATE. THESE RACIAL DISPARITIES AND I'VE SAID THIS IS THIS COMMITTEE NUMBER TIMES BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND. THE BOOK THE COLOR OF LAW. WHICH DOCUMENTS QUITE CLEAR NOT JUST -- RED LINING IN MORTGAGE POLICIES BUT LITERALLY THE HISTORY. OF ZONING. AND HOW -- THE EXPANSION OF OUR ONE ZONING AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE U. S. HISTORY IN RESPONSE TO WHETHER IT WAS EXPLICITLY SAID OR NOT. BUT THEY WERE SIGNIFICANT JUMPS IN EFFORTS TO DOWN ZONE AFTER THINGS LIKE THE PASSAGE OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT. AND THE COURT RULING IN THE CIGARETTE INTEGRATION OF SCHOOLS. SO THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF GOOD DOCUMENTATION AROUND. BE RACIAL AND ECONOMIC. EXPLICIT RACIAL AND ECONOMIC EXCLUSION. PURPOSE OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING. I'M THANK YOU SIR SKINNER AND I WON JUST. REITERATE -- DIE -- YOU KNOW AND I GREW UP IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME. OUR COMMUNITY WORK BUT IT WAS YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW AND THIS IS SO COMMON WHERE YOU IN SO MANY -- SUBURBAN AREAS IN PARTICULAR IT SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN THE NEW ONE PART OF TOWN. DEAD ZONE FOR MULTI UNIT AND THAT'S WERE LOW INCOME PEOPLE LIVE AND IT ABSOLUTELY PERPETUATE SEGREGATION -- AND YOU KNOW SINGLE FAMILY HOMES OWNING WASN'T IT STRUCK DOWN RACIAL ZONING AND SO -- I THINK WE NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT HISTORY AND AND TODAY IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A IT IS NOT. THAT IT'S ABOUT THE FACT NO I'M -- AND SO -- WHICH IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO OUR AND GRAPPLE WITH. ONE THING I WANT TO ASK FOR NON THIS COLEMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR REMARKS AND I'VE ENJOYED WORKING WITH THE LEAGUE EVEN THOUGH I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE. ON WELL AND ONE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY TRY. I WOULD LOVE TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION AWAY FROM IS THERE'S THIS WHOLE NOTION OF SO THE GOOD ACTORS CITIES IN THE BAD ACTORS CITIES. AND THE BAD ACTORS CITIES PUNISHMENT SO THEY GET TO TAKE MORE HOUSING AND THE GOOD ACTORS CITIES GET A GET A PASS AND OF COURSE WE WANT ALL CITIES TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. AND YOU KNOW THERE YES SIR THE FORTY SEVEN CITIES THAT ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING ELEMENT LAW -- ONE WAS SUED -- BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOUSING PRODUCTION -- TWO THIRDS OF CITIES THIS IS ABOUT -- THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MUCH BIGGER THAN THE FORTY SEVEN WHO MAY HAVE PERFECTLY COMPLIANT. HOUSING ELEMENTS TWO THIRDS ARE NOT MEETING THE RENO GOALS AT ANY. INCOME LEVEL SO THESE ARE CITIES THAT HAVE. THEY MIGHT HAVE BEAUTIFUL HOUSING ELEMENTS THAT ARE PERFECTLY COMPLIANCE WITH A NOT MEAN THEIR GOALS BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIVE IN HOUSING ELEMENTS PEOPLE LIVING. IN HOMES -- AND SO [inaudible] IT'S TO ME IT'S NOT ABOUT WHO'S A GOOD ACTORS IS A BAD ACTOR IT'S ABOUT. WHAT? WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE THAT WE'VE CREATED? FOR HOUSING -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE SOMETIMES CITIES AND CITY COUNCILS MAYORS COULD DEMONIZED -- AND I DON'T BY PERSONAL AGREE WITH OVERWHELMINGLY PEOPLE OR A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICER THERE YOU KNOW FOR THE RIGHT REASONS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY AND GET THE LITTLEOR NOTHING AND GET YELLED AT A LOT. YOU KNOW BY PEOPLE -- ANSWER THE QUESTIONS HAD HOW DO WE CREATE A STRUCTURE THAT FACILITATES. AN OF HOUSING WITHOUT ANY BLAMING OF ANYONE. ON AND SO MY MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS. DOES THE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE TODAY [inaudible] WHICH IS. LARA OVERWHELMINGLY UNTIL VERY RECENTLY -- LOCAL CONTROL THERE ARE STATE LAWS THAT DIDN'T GET ENFORCED VERY MUCH -- LOT OF LOCAL DECISION MAKING ON HAVE WERE GOING TO ALLOW NEW HOUSING HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW OR GOING TO BAN EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES OR WE GONNA ALLOW FOR MULTI YEAR. THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS TO APPROVE THE ZONING FOR PLANNED PROJECTS -- WITH CREATED THE SYSTEM AND AND A STATE RESPONSIBILITY -- TO WE KNOW THEIR SITUATIONS WERE SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; CAN --&lt;/c&gt;</u> THE LADY ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE HOUSING. WHEN WE HAVE TO ADD IF ONE AGREES THAT WE HAVE A THREE AND A HALF POINT ON DEFICIT HOW? WHAT WE NEED TO DO? TO GET THERE IT'S A LOT RACHEL IS A LOT OF HOUSING AND SO -- AT WHAT WHAT DO WAY TO GET THERE IS COMMON HOW MUCH IS HOW MUCH TIME YOU CAN JUMP ME. WIENER. OF THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND AND THE SENTIMENT AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEED -- TO TO PAY ATTENTION TO EQUITY AND THE INEQUITIES IN IN THE SYSTEMS THAT WE MAY HAVE -- TODAY WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET THERE I THINK WE'RE AT A MOMENT IN. I SEE MY SHORT HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE FOR TWO YEARS BUT IN TWO YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE. THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN TOP OF MIND -- pMEMBERSHIP. THAT IS BEEN A PRIORITY WHAT WE DO ABOUT HOUSING AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY HAS BEEN AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. A SINCE I STEPPED FOOT INTO THE STATE -- I THINK THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS AND I DON'T TAKE SAME OUT LIGHTLY -- BUT THERE ARE -- THERE ARE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE CITY OFFICIALS HAVE TO THEIR RESIDENCE -- BUT AS WE HAVE HEARD DESCRIBED A LITTLE BIT -- FROM THE OTHER PANELISTS TODAY -- AND IN THE BACKGROUND THERE. THERE ARE MANY FOR THAT MAKE UP WHAT WE CALL THE HOUSING PRODUCTION SYSTEM IN THE STATE. AND I THINK -- IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER SYSTEM TOMORROW. THAT GETS US TO YES TO MORE HOUSING TOMORROW. ON THEN IT IS INCUMBENT FOR ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS TO BE AT THE TABLE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MANY DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND FACTORS. THAT MAKE UP WHAT WE CALL HOUSING SYSTEM YES. THERE ARE THINGS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO DO BETTER MUST DO BETTER AS WE HEAD INTO THE FUTURE YOU ALL HAVE -- HELPED US DO MORE OF THAT WITH THE FUNDING THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED SET THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVETHE PLAN CAPACITY THAT THEY MIGHT NEED HAVE THAT CAPACITY. SO -- YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON ON DOING OUR PART BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE THE WORKFORCE CHALLENGES AND ISSUES -- IN OUR STATE -- WE CAN'T IGNORE THE IMPACT THAT -- THE TENSION BETWEEN -- DESIRING A CLEAN REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- AND THE USE OF OTHER TOOLS TO HELP INTERFERE. WITH THAT HOUSING -- I I THINK AT SOME POINT WORLD I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS MUST BE ON THE TABLE FOR AN HONEST CONVERSATION. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- YOUR I CAN AGREE ON THE SET -- THERE'S OF COURSE NO ONE SILVER BULLET BUT NO ZONING PROCESS FUNDING CETERA ON IT ALL HAS TO BE ON TABLES ARE PROJECT THAT REQUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER. BUT THIS TO GO FOR A ALL FAURIA AND JUST. GET INTO SOME SPECIFICS WILL AGREE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL ITEMS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US THAT WE ARE HAVING CHALLENGES WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TACKLE. I THINK -- ONE OF THE LARGEST ITEMS THAT WE HAVE THOUGH ARE THOSE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR DOUBLE UNITS -- THAT BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE'RE GONNA BE SHORT. WAS OUR MARKET THOSE ARE AFFORDABLE RENTALS IN FACT I EIGHTY DAYS PREDICTION ABOUT A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MARKET SURPLUS IN THAT SAME TIME PERIOD WHEN IT COMES TO MARGUERITE RENTALS. A SALE THAT IS. I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC BILLS HERE TODAY IS -- CENTER WINNER AND I CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE STRATEGIC CAN FILL IN THAT STREAMLINING. BECAUSE WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE. IS THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME APPROACH. TO BE ABLE TO GET HOUSING BUILT FASTER. IN AREAS WHERE -- HOUSING HAS ALREADY BEEN SEWN ABLE TO GET YOUR TAKE. ON THAT -- BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE ON HOW WE GET THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS. AND TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS -- ON LOOKING AT A STRATEGIC APPROACH OR AREAS OF ALREADY BEEN SOWN FOR HOUSING. AND TO BE ABLE TO STREAM THAT PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BELT AND I COULD COMMENT ON THAT. IF YOU THINK THAT'S ONE OF OUR TOP TOOLS IN ABOUT. NOT ALL AT ONCE SO -- CHAIRMAN OUT I'VE BEEN HAPPY TO TO CHIME IN ON ON THIS -- ONE YOU KNOW. IN THE LAST AGAIN I LOOK AT THE LAST TWO YEARS -- A COUPLE OF THE TOOLS THAT I THINK -- WILL HELP ACCELERATE A GETTING HOUSES BUILT GETTING AFFORDABLE HOUSES BUILT OUR PROP ONE AND AND PROP -- TO WE AT UNDERSTAND IN THE STATE YEARS AGO THERE WAS A DIFFERENT SOURCE. OF ON GOING FINANCING THAT HELPED PRODUCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THAT RESOURCE NO LONGER EXIST AND THEIR EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO AT LEAST HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT A REPLACEMENT -- BUT I THINK PROP ONE IN -- SIX TOWARDS -- GETTING MORE HOUSES PRODUCED QUICKLY I THINK IF WE CAN -- SEE A NEW VERSION TODAY'S VERSION OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING -- I THINK THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO GETTING MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS -- UNITS BUILT I THINK -- WITH SOME OF THE PLANNING DOLLARS FROM SB TWO I THINK AND I BELIEVE THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING TO START TO FLOW -- IN JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS THAT -- CITIES AROUND THE STATE -- WILL BE -- TAKING UP THE OFFER OF THOSE RESOURCES AND STREAMLINING THEIR PROCESS SEES AND ALSO UPDATING THEIR PLANS AND AND THERE'S OWNING SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME VERY IMPORTANT TOOLS. THAT YOU ALL AND ARE VOTERS HAVE PUT INTO PLACE EVEN IN JUST THE LAST YEAR THAT WILL HELP ACCELERATE OR AT LEAST JUMPSTART. SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION THAT PROBABLY WASN'T HAPPENING A YEAR AGO BUT I SUSPECT KNOWING OF MY CITIES THE WAY I DO ABOUT WERE PROBABLY PLANNED WAITING FOR RESOURCES. TO GET THOSE UNDER WAY. THE RABBIT JUST ADD -- I THINK THAT WE HAVE A MYRIAD OF CHALLENGES THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OUR TO OUR ISSUE AND AND SO YOU YOU REALLY FIGURING OUT HOW DO I HOW TO TACKLE IT FROM MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUILD OURSELVES OUT OF THIS PROBLEM WHEN A UNIT OF HOUSING COSTS SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUILD. AFFORDABLE UNIT RIGHT SO THE CONSTRUCTION STATE OF ALL WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING DOWN COSTS IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BRING MORE UNITS ONLINE FASTER WHICH THEN LEADS LEADS TO HOW DO WE LOOK AT DIFFERENT TYPOLOGIES. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK WITH OUR LABOR COMMUNITY AND OUR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT MODULAR HOUSING ABOUT HOW DO WE BRING NEW CONSTRUCTION ON FASTER -- SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE COMPONENTS I THINK ANOTHER CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS. EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO WE WERE ZONE FOR ALL THE HOUSING WE NEEDED -- AND WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD IT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LABOR TO ACTUALLY BUILD IT SO FIGURING OUT HOW DO WE LOOK AT THE LABOR PIPELINE SO THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY DO THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW HOUSING -- ACTED ACQUISITION REHABS I MEAN WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT NOT WHO IS CURRENTLY IN THE LABOR MARKET IN OUR LABOR UNIONS BUT HOW DO WE LOOK AT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HOW DO WE TAP INTO -- YOU KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE IN OAKLAND FOR EXAMPLE WHO BY BY THE TIME THEY REACHED HIGH SCHOOL ARE NOT FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL HOW DO WE GET THOSE FOLKS INTERESTED IN THE TRADES. SO HOT WE HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE% CREATIVE AND DYNAMIC AROUND OUR SOLUTIONS AND BE ABLE TO COME AT IT FROM DIFFERENT. LEVELS SO THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN CAN SEE THEMSELVES IN THE SOLUTIONS. MY COMMENTS ARE GONNA BE ABOUT THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION. BUT I'LL I'LL JUST REITERATE A COUPLE THINGS -- WE WE DO HAVE SOME TREMENDOUS NEW RESOURCES -- FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THINK THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH COSTS KEEP RISING THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BECOME LESS AND LESS EFFICIENT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BUILD. AS MANY HOMES AS ARE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM -- SO JUST TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AND THEN I THINK WE ALSO GET CAUGHT IN THIS -- A DISCUSSION OF WHAT ARE WE ACTUALLY BUILDING ARE WE BUILDING REALLY DENSE TALL HOUSING -- OR WE ONLY BUILDING -- SINGLE FAMILY HOMES OF PLACES ONE OF ARCHER'S CENTER FOLLOWS THAT SHE DOES REALLY GOOD WORK ON THIS -- AND WE HAVE LARGE. SWATHS OF LAND WHERE YOU HAVE NO BUILDING -- WHATSOEVER OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES -- IT IN SO TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT BUILDING TYPOLOGIES SO MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING THINGS LIKE DUPLEXES AND PRACTICES -- AND WHERE THAT FITS INTO OUR EXISTING LAND USE PATTERNS I THINK THAT'S A REALLY KEY COMPONENT AS THIS TYPE OF HOUSING IS INHERENTLY CHEAPER TO BUILD CAN BE BUILT FASTER -- AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY DISRUPT THE EXISTING CHARACTER MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS -- SO -- I'LL HELLO LEAVE IT AT THAT. SENATE MCGUIRE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN HOUSING SHOULD FOCUS ON MEETING THAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR HOME. GAP THAT YOU IDENTIFIED THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S A CRISIS DISPROPORTIONATELY BORNE BY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS -- AND SO WE WE NEED MORE PUBLIC INVESTMENT ABSOLUTELY FROM THE STATE AND AND LOCALLY. I'LL JUST MAKE A PLUG YOU KNOW WE MAY ALSO NEED LANDS THAT HIS OWN TO ALLOW FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING WHICH IS. A CHEAPER ON A PER UNIT BASIS TO BUILD. AND ST CHEAPER TO LIVE IN -- SO THAT WE CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ALSO APARTMENT BUILDINGS THAT ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO TRIGGER AN INCLUSIONARY POLICY. THAT SO THEY HAVE AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THEM -- CLOSE TO TRANSIT YES IT'S THAT HAVE. A TYPICALLY RESISTED APARTMENT BUILDINGS HISTORICALLY WHICH MAY NOT BE RIGHT NEXT TO TRANSIT BUT THEY MIGHT BE CLOSE TO JOB CENTERS AND SO BUILDING THERE WOULD ALLOW. THAT KIND OF RACIAL AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AND ALSO SHORTER DRIVING COMMUTES OVERALL SO THAT SHOULD BE PART OF THE STATE'S STRATEGY. THANK YOU OKAY ANY OTHER. YOUR QUESTION SEEING NONE -- I WANT TO THANK OUR FIRST PANEL -- WE APPRECIATE IT WILL NOW MOVE TO OUR SECOND -- PANEL THE IMPACTS ON HOUSING STATE PLANNING A REQUIREMENTS. AND SO WE CAN DO A LITTLE TRANSITION HERE. AND BRING UP THE SECOND BOTTLE OKAY SO WE HAVE -- TWO PANELISTS ON THIS NEXT PANEL UNTIL IMPACTS ON HOUSING STATE PLAN REQUIREMENTS -- WE HAVE MAKING KERR COULD BE WHO IS THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR FAIR HOUSING OF THE HOUSING POLICY DIVISION. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THE LONG TITLE -- AND WE HAVE VALERIE FELDMAN IS A STAFF ATTORNEY THE WITH THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT SO WELCOME -- I WILL START WITH A MISS KIRBY AND THEN HEAR FROM INSTALLMENT AND AGAIN I WOULD ASK YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO FIVE MINUTES OR SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. HERE TODAY AND OF COURSE I COULD SPEND THREE HOURS TALKING ABOUT THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS-ASSESSMENT BUT WE'LL. KEEP IT HIGH LEVEL TODAY -- AS THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ROOTED IN FAIR HOUSING IN REDUCING THE CONCENTRATIONS OF POVERTY AND SEGREGATION THROUGH PLANNING. THE STATUTORY OBJECTIVES OF RENO INCLUDE INCREASING HOUSING SUPPLY IN A MIX OF HOUSING TYPES PROMOTING INFILL DEVELOPMENT. AND IMPROVE IN A REGIONAL JOBS HOUSING RELATIONSHIP -- BALANCING DISPROPORTIONATE HOUSEHOLD INCOMES -- AND WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE LAST YEAR. THERE WAS THE ADDITION OF THE AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING. REQUIREMENT IN THE STATUTORY OBJECTIVES OF RENO REALLY. REAFFIRMING THIS LINK TO FAIR HOUSING -- AS WELL AS SOME ADDITIONAL CHANGES -- IN THE BOLD LANGUAGE. THE RENO PROCESS BEGINS WITH H. CITY IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH UNIT AS WELL AS THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENT. DEVELOPING A REGIONAL HOUSING NEED DETERMINATION ACROSS FOR INCOME CATEGORIES USING A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT I'LL GO THROUGH ON THE NEXT SLIDE. INCLUDING SOME NEW FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED BY SB EIGHT TO EIGHT AND AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE THIS YEAR. H. C. D. MUST PROVIDE THE DETERMINATION AT LEAST TWO YEARS BEFORE HOUSING ELEMENT DUE DATE THAT LEAVES ONE YEAR FOR THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENT TO A RUN THROUGH THEIR PROCESS. AND ONE YEAR FOR THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. TO BUT IN LARGER REGIONS -- EIGHTY PROVIDES THE DETERMINATION MUCH EARLIER TO ALLOW MORE TIME FOR THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT. TO PROVIDE ITS REGIONAL HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS. THAT REGIONAL HOUSING -- NEED ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS. BUT IS THE BLUE SECTION BUT THERE'S ALSO NEW STATUTE THIS YEAR THROUGH AB THE PASSAGE OF AB. SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE THE NOW PROVIDES EACH CD THE ABILITY TO REVIEW OF THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS METHODOLOGY OF HOW THEY PLAN TO DO THAT ALLOCATION. AND GIVES IT TO THE THE ABILITY TO APPEAL -- THAT ALLOCATION IF IT. DOES NOT FURTHER THE STATUTORY OBJECTIVES ARENA. THE THERE ARE SEVERAL A TWENTY RURAL COUNTIES IN THE NORTH STATE AND SIERRA PARTS THE STATE. WHERE IT'S H. CITY AXES THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS SO NOT ONLY DOES THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINE THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEED ON A REGIONAL LEVEL -- FOR THOSE COUNTIES BUT WE ALSO ACT AS THEIR COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENT GIVING EACH JURISDICTION THEIR ALLOCATION OF RINA. THEN THAT PROCESS MOVES TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- WHATEVER RINA ALLOCATION THAT THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN -- THEY USED TO PRODUCE THEIR HOUSE THE HOUSING PLAN OF THEIR GENERAL PLAN -- AND PROVIDE THAT HOUSING PLAN BACK TO HDD TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT ZONING TO MEET THAT REGIONAL HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION. AS WELL AS PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. TO REDUCE. BARRIERS AS WELL AS ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT TO HAPPEN AND THE DEPARTMENT REVIEWS AND APPROVES THOSE PLANS. SO THE THAT EACH CITY SIDE OF THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEED -- IS SHOWN ON THIS SLIDE HERE. THAT THE REGIONAL NUMBER EIGHTY PROVIDES THE COG IS TO THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED STARTING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROJECTIONS. DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE PROJECTED TO LIVE IN THE REGION AT THE END OF THE CYCLE. AND EACH CITY ADDRESS THE HOUSING NEEDS -- BEYOND THIS TO ACCOUNT FOR PARTICULAR FACTORS. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE THIS YEAR ADDED UNITS LOST DUE TO AN EMERGENCY AND SB EIGHT TWO EIGHT ADDED CLARITY AROUND OVERCROWDING AND THE VACANCY RATE AS FACTORS. AN ADDED COST BURDEN IS A NEW FACTOR. SB EIGHT TWO EIGHT ALSO CODIFIED THAT THESE FACTORS. ARE MEANT TO ADDRESS THE OVERALL HOUSING NEED. SO ONCE THAT WE TAKE THE PROJECT HOUSEHOLDS ON AT THE END OF THIS CYCLE AND WE ADJUSTED BASED ON THESE FACTORS. WITHIN SUBTRACT OUT HOW MANY UNITS THERE ARE TODAY IN THAT REGION UP FROM THAT NUMBER TO GET THAT GAP OF WHAT WE NEED TO SEE PRODUCED OVER THE NEXT CYCLE AND THAT IS THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT -- THE EIGHTY PROVIDES TO THE COUNCIL OF THE COUNCIL GOVERNMENT MUST THEN TAKE THIS REGIONAL NUMBER AND CONSIDER STATUTORY FACTORS IN ITS ALLOCATION TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN ADDITION TO THE STATUTORY OBJECTIVES I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING. MOST OF THESE FACTORS EXISTED IN PRIOR CYCLES BUT AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE NOW REQUIRES COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS RIDE MORE DOCUMENTATION ON HOW THE FACTORS ARE USED IN THE METHODOLOGY. AND EACH CITY CAN REVIEW THE METHODOLOGY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT FURTHERS THE STATUTORY OBJECTIVES. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND SB A TO A ALSO MADE ADDITIONAL CHANGES THE SECTION TO ADD OVERCROWDING LOTS OF UNITS DURING AN EMERGENCY. GHG EMISSION TARGETS AS FACTORS THE COG MUST CONSIDER. AND WHEN OTHER FACTORS -- ARE YOU SORT OF THIS -- BLANKET THAT THAT THE COG HAS THE ABILITY TO ADD OTHER FACTORS THAT MIGHT NOT BE PART OF THIS LIST THEY MUST BE SHOWN TO NOT BE IN CONFLICT WITH THE STATUTORY OBJECTIVES. SB EIGHT TWO EIGHT ALSO PROHIBITED THE COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENT FROM USING PASSED UNDER PRODUCTION AS A REASON FOR RINA. WE ARE NOW AT THE END OF THE FIFTH CYCLE OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT. SO THAT TIME LINE SHOWN HERE -- ARE FOR THE FIFTH CYCLE AND WE ARE NOW JUST EMBARKING ON THE BEGINNING OF THE SIX CYCLE OF REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS. ASSESSMENT PREPARATION SO THE SAN DIEGO -- ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS ALSO KNOWN -- HAS RECEIPT RECEIVED THEIR DRUG THERE -- FINAL ALLOCATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT -- AND THEY ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THEIR METHODOLOGY -- TO ALLOCATE THAT TO THEIR JURISDICTIONS. WHERE IS THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS AND THE SACRAMENTO ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS WILL RECEIVE THEIR -- AT DRAFT ASSESSMENTS FROM MARINA ON IN THE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. I WOULD THINK IT'S HELPFUL. TO EXPLAIN THAT THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS A PROJECTION OF ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNITS NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE PROJECTED HOUSEHOLD GROWTH. OF ALL INCOME LEVELS FROM THE START UNTIL THE END OF THE PROJECTION PERIOD. SO IT IS NOT A PREDICTION OF HOW MUCH -- PERMITTING WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN AND IT CERTAINLY IS NOT A CEILING OF HOW MUCH HOUSING -- DEMANDER PRODUCTION SHOULD OCCUR AND IT IS NOT LIMITED DUE TO EXISTING LAND USE CAPACITY OR GROWTH CONTROL REZONING IS OFTEN NECESSARY FOR JURISDICTIONS TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR THEIR ARENA AT THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT HOUSING ELEMENTS -- AND A LOT OF THE CHANGES THAT COME FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN HOUSING PACKAGE -- WILL MAKE SIX CYCLE A FRIEND AND ARE TOO MUCH TO COVER IN A SHORT TIME TODAY BUT YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION ON ALL OF THOSE ON OUR WEBSITE -- OR WE ARE AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER KARIM I ALSO WON A SISTER PUBLICLY THANK. EACH CD I'M HAVING THE AUTHORED BY TWO BILLS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT REQUIRED DOT. QUICK IMPLEMENTATION SB THIRTY FIVE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THEN SB EIGHT TWO EIGHT THIS PAST YEAR ITS CITY WAS JUST SO ON THE BALL. IN TERMS OF GETTING THEM IMPLEMENTED I KNOW WE EVERY LEGISLATOR HAS A HORROR STORY ABOUT PASSING A LAW AND THEN -- GET SIGNED THE LAW THEM FIVE YEARS LATER IT'S NOT HAVE OF AGENCY HAS IMPLEMENTED IT BUT IT'S IT IS REALLY ON TOP OF IT SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU OKAY SOMEONE. IT AFTERNOON. SO I WORK FOR THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT WHICH IS A STATE WIDE SUPPORT CENTER -- PROVIDING TRAINING AND EXPERTISE TO LOCAL LEGAL AID PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN AREAS OF HOUSING LAND USE AND PUBLIC BENEFITS. AND MY TRAINING FOR THIS JOB WAS I SPENT FOURTEEN YEARS IN A LOCAL LEGAL AID PROGRAM WHERE MOST OF THE FOCUS OF MY WORK WAS ON HOUSING AND LAND USE. MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WATCH IN OUR DOOR EVERY DAY WHO ARE A CONSTANT REMINDER OF THE IMPACT OF NOT HAVING STABLE SAFE HOUSE. RIGHT ALL OF THE EMPLOYMENT NECESSARY NOT OUT COMES IN RESPONSE TO THAT -- WHAT I WANTED TO VOTE FOCUS ON TODAY OR THREE PRIMARY AREAS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHANGES TO HOUSING ELEMENT LAW AND KIND OF THE RESPONSES TO THAT THE BENEFITS RIGHT IN TERMS OF INCREASING COMPLIANCE AND ALSO? I JUST INCREASING COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW BUT THAT RESULTING IN BETTER PLANNING AND ZONING AND PRODUCTION OF HOUSING -- GOING BACK TO CHANGES THAT WERE MADE PRIOR TO THE FIFTH CYCLE THAT MEGAN REFERRED TO ALSO SOME CHANGES THAT WERE PART OF THE ENORMOUS HOUSING PACKAGE INTO TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT'S EARLY NOW IN THE PLANNING STAGES TO SEE SOME OF THOSE RESPONSES -- BUT I CAN TELL YOU ANECDOTALLY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR AND THEN LASTLY JUST TO FOCUS ON SOME FUTURE CHANGES TO HOUSING ELEMENT LAW -- HOPEFULLY AS SENATOR POINTED OUT HOUSING ELEMENTS DON'T HOUSE PEOPLE HOMES DO BUT AS WE RAISE THE BAR FOR WHAT HOUSING ON IT'S REQUIRED THAT IS MORE LIKELY TO RESULT IN HOMES THAT IT WAS MAYBE TEN YEARSAGO -- SO FIRST TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT HAPPENED AT THE START OF THE FIFTH -- PLANNING PERIOD IN THOSE YOU KNOW WE NOW HAVE HAD EIGHT YEARS AND SOME OF THESE JURISDICTIONS ARE ALMOST EIGHT YEARS TO SEE HOW THOSE CHANGES HAVE IMPACTED AS A MOSTLY UP POSITIVELY -- SOIN ADDITION TO CHANGING HOUSING ELEMENTS TO AN EIGHT YEAR PLANNING PERIOD THERE WERE SOME OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES -- ONE WAS TO IMPOSE A PENALTY FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD AND CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT DID NOT TIMELY ADOPT THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT. SO THAT IF THEY WENT BEYOND A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS FROM THEIR STATUTORY DUE DATE -- THEY HAD TO DO TO HOUSING TO ESTABLISH A FIRM DEADLINE FOR ANY REZONING THAT WAS REQUIRED IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE SITES IN YOUR INVENTORY AND YOU NEEDED TO REZONE FOR THAT SHORTFALL YOU HAD TO DO SO WITHIN THREE YEARS -- AND LASTLY IDENTIFYING ZONES WHERE EMERGENCY SHELTERS COULD BE LOCATED -- WITHOUT DISCRETIONARY REVIEW. SO I WOULD SAY THE OUTCOMES TO THOSE THREE PRIMARY CHANGES WERE MOSTLY POSITIVE -- SOME OF THEM WERE NOT AS MUCH. OF I WOULD SAY IN THE AREA OF THE DUE DATE -- WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF YOUR STATUTORY DEADLINE HAS CAUSED SOME CONFUSION IT OFTEN BECAME FROM THE AT BAT BECAUSE PERSPECTIVE THAT THE NEW DEADLINE WAS THE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS AFTER THE STATUTORY DUE DATE RIGHT NO LONGER DO WE PAY ATTENTION TO NECESSARILY. THE DUE DATE THAT IS IN THE STATUTE BUT NOW THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS AS A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OUT WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY GETTING TIMELY ADOPTION AND OFF IN JURISDICTIONS REFER TO THIS AS THE GRACE PERIOD -- IT WASN'T INTENDED THIS IS A TO BE SO BUT THAT'S HOW IT WAS REFERRED -- TO THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THAT IS THAT. THE STATUTORY DUE DATE REQUIRED YOU TO ADOPT A HOUSING ELEMENT WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS BUT NOT A LEGALLY SUFFICIENT HOUSING ELEMENT AT THAT TIME. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS JURISDICTIONS ADOPT A HOUSING ELEMENT AND THEN RECEIVE A LETTER FINING FROM A CD THAT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND THEN IT MIGHT TAKE ONE YEAR SIX MONTHS TWO YEARS FOR THEM TO REVISE THAT HOUSING ELEMENT. TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE SO TIMELY ADOPTION DOESN'T NECESSARILY TRANSLATE INTO TIMELY ADOPTION OF A LEGALLY SUFFICIENT HOUSING ELEMENT -- THE OTHER FACTOR THAT REMAINS -- AT I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE IS THE IDEA OF THE FOUR YEAR ELEMENT AS RESULT OF NOT ADOPTING A HOUSING ELEMENT IN A TIMELY WAY -- AND THAT'S BECAUSE I I I AND NOT IN THE MINDSET OF THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THE ADOPTED THAT PENALTY BUT THE ASSUMPTION PROBABLY WAS THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE WITH IT MOST JURISDICTIONS WOULD BE WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF THAT. DEADLINE. SOMETIMES JURISDICTIONS ARE TWO THREE IN ADOPTING THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT AND SO THE IDEA OF ADOPTING A FOUR YEAR CYCLE THAT BECOMES CONFUSING BECAUSE ARE YOU REQUIRED TO UPDATE WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF JUST ADOPTING YOU'RE. VERY VERY LATE HOUSING ELEMENT -- OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE TECHNICAL ISSUES BUT THEY DO NEED TO BE RESOLVED TO GET THE BEST AND MOST LEGALLY SUFFICIENT HOUSING ELEMENTS THAT WE CAN. I WOULD SAY A VERY POSITIVE -- RESPONSE HAS BEEN TO THE DEADLINE OF HAVING TO RESIGN WITHIN THREE YEARS -- PREVIOUSLY ON THE FIVE YEAR PLANNING PERIOD WITHOUT A REQUIREMENT FOR WHEN THE RESUMES HAD TO OCCUR SOMETIMES JURISDICTIONS WERE WAITING FOR THE VERY END OF THE PLANNING. OBVIOUSLY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET YOUR HOUSING NEED FOR THAT PLANNING PUREED IF YOU'RE WAITING TO THE VERY LAST MINUTE TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE ZONING SO HAVING AN UP FRONT DEADLINE THREE YEARS INTO THE PROCESS WHEN YOU STILL HAVE SEVERAL YEARS AGO. IT'S BEEN A VERY POSITIVE CHANGE AND HAS RESULTED IN A LOT OF REZONING IS HAPPENING MUCH EARLIER IN THE PLANNING PROCESS THAN EVER BEFORE -- AND THE LAST OF CHANGE THAT I REFERRED TO IS DESIGNATING SITES FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS -- THAT DO NOT REQUIRE DISCRETIONARY REVIEW AND I WOULD SAY THERE THE THE RESPONSE HAS ALSO BEEN POSITIVE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS WHO COMPLIED WITH THAT REQUIREMENT -- ONE AREA THAT WE TEND TO FOCUS ON IS AT HOUSING ADVOCATES IS THE CAPACITY OF THOSE SITES THE NOT JUST IDENTIFYING A ZONE WHERE SHELTERS ARE PERMITTED BUT THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY CAPACITY IN THOSE SITES FOR SHELTERS TO BE DEVELOPED AND THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY. SOME PROXIMITY TO TRANSIT IN OTHER NEEDS THAT SHELTER -- RESIDENTS WOULD HAVE. IN TERMS OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CHANGES AS I MENTIONED IT'S EARLY IN THE PROCESS THERE SOME. COMMUNITIES AS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THAT ARE VERY LATE IN THEIR PROCESS AND IN ADOPTING THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT AND THEY ARE SUBJECT TO THE CHANGES FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN PACKAGE -- AN OVER ALL I WOULD SAY THAT THE THE THE MORE RIGID REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF USING NON BACON SITES IN TERMS OF HAVING TO MONITOR YOUR LOSS OF UNITS TO THE NET CHANGES TO THE NO NET LOSS. OF LAW HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY HAVING SUITABLE FEASIBLE SO. SO YOU FOR FOR A LONG TIME JURISDICTIONS COULD IDENTIFY NON VACANT SITES AS PART OF THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT INVENTORY. BUT HAVING TO SHOW THAT THE EXISTING USES REALLY ARE NOT GOING TO INTERFERE OR IMPEDE WITH POTENTIAL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN. VERY USEFUL IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THOSE SITES REALLY ARE FEASIBLE AND WILL PROBABLY DEVELOP WITHIN THE PLANNING PERIOD -- THE LAST POINT I WANTED TO MAKE IS ABOUT FUTURE CHANGES AND SO. PROBABLY THE CHANGES TO NO NET LOSS COME CLOSEST -- TO IDENTIFYING THE REAL ISSUE THAT THAT THAT MAY BE LACKING BETWEEN THE PLANNING FOR HOUSING AND THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION OF HOUSING WHICH IS THAT WE RELIED ON A LONG TIME FOR DENSITY AS A PROXY FOR AFFORDABILITY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN TERMS OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT INVENTORY -- AND NO NET LOSS CHANGES HAVE BEEN THE CLOSEST TO KIND OF IDENTIFYING THE IDEA THAT IF YOU IDENTIFY A SITE IN YOUR HOUSING ELEMENT. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A SPECIFIC INCOME GROUP. AND THAT SITE IS DEVELOPED FOR DOT FOR A DIFFERENT INCOME GROUP THAT YOU HAVE TO REPLACE IT SO IDENTIFYING THAT THE SITE IS NOT JUST ABOUT DENSITY BUT ACTUALLY BEING AVAILABLE FOR THAT INCOME LEVEL. OTHER CHANGES ARE PROBABLY NECESSARY LOOSE CHANGE WAS MADE. PART OF LEGISLATIVE CHANGE YES THAT'S I THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT THAT HIS GOD IF YOU KNOW THAT'S A VERY USEFUL STEP TOWARDS KIND OF AVOIDING DENSITY AS THE PROP THE ONLY PROXY FOR AFFORDABILITY. INSTEAD OF A REQUIREMENT FOR AFFORDABILITY WHETHER THAT COMES FROM A REQUIREMENT WHETHER IT COMES FROM INCENTIVES THAT'S FOR THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM TO DECIDE. BUT NEEDING MORE THAN JUST THE IDEA THAT DENSITY ALONE IS GOING TO RESULT IN AFFORDABILITY ESPECIALLY IN MOST OF THE LARGER HOUSING MARKETS IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MY CHANCE TO SUBMIT THESE COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ACCORDING TO THEIR ANY QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL -- YES SENATOR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M. STILL TRYING TO GET MY ARMS AROUND RENO AFTER. ALL THESE YEARS AND SO I HAVE FOUR CITIES. THERE JAY SENT THE BORDER EACH OTHER. ONE HAS TO READ READ A REQUIREMENT OF FIVE ANOTHER ONE TOO BUT WE'RE GETTING RID OF THAT THAT'S GOING TO GO AWAY. ANOTHER ONE IS. EIGHTY SIX WE ARE THE FIRST TO A POPULATIONS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND SOME ODD. EIGHTY SIXES GOT. EIGHTY THOUSAND AND IN A CITY OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH HAS ARENA REQUIREMENT OF ABOUT. ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE WHICH YEAH. AND AND AND THEIR SHORT FOUR HUNDRED I MEAN THEY'RE WORKING ON IT. BUT IT SAID CITY HUNTINGTON BEACH I GOT. TO AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHY IS A CITY THAT'S TRYING TO PRODUCE THIRTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY THREE UNITS FROM THE NEIGHBOR? NEXT DOOR ONLY HAS TO PRODUCE. TO IS NOW THE CENTER OF ALL THE NEWS AND ALL THE FUN AROUND HERE SO HELP ME OUT CAN YOU. HOW DO I EXPLAIN THIS TO MY CONSTITUENTS? I SO YES THE THE THE FIFTH CYCLE AND THE LAST CYCLE WE CAME UP ON AS THE NUMBERS YOU'RE REFERRING TO SO THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT JURISDICTION'S HAVE RIGHT NOW. AND A COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENT ON EVERYTHING OTHER THAN THE BOLD ON THIS THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENT -- FOR THAT REGION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO WAS LEGALLY REQUIRED TO CONSIDER ALL OF THESE FACTORS IN HOW THEY TOOK THE REGIONAL NUMBER THAT EACH CITY PROVIDED. IN ALLOCATING TO THEIR JURISDICTIONS -- BUT THERE WASN'T A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHAT THEY HAD TO DO OTHER THAN CONSIDER THAT SO COMING UP IN THE NEXT CYCLE THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SPELL OUT. HOW ALL NUMBERS WERE GIVEN OUT ACCORDING TO A METHODOLOGY INCLUDING? MAKE IT CLEAR HOW EACH OF THE FACTORS ON THIS LIST WAS USED -- AND AC WILL HAVE A REVIEW WITH ALREADY THERE THAT WASN'T PRESENT IN THE PRIOR CYCLE AND SO THERE IS NO WAY TO TRACE BACK THE LINEAGE OF HOW. A FIVE VERSES AT TEN THOUSAND WAS DECIDED -- SO THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL CHANGE GOING FORWARD BUT WAS NOT PRESENT IN THE LAST CYCLE -- AND THEN I I I THINK DOES THAT ADDRESS PART OF THAT'S GOOD THAT HELPS BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M SITTING HERE GOING I AM NOT. I'M NOT DOING THE MATH IT'S NOT IT'S NOT WORKING OUT FOR ME SO I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BRING IT UP ST JUDE MENTIONED. THE CITY AT THE LAST PANEL AND AND AND JUST. YOU KNOW FOR MAYBE. EQUAL TIME MR. I PRESENT MY MAJOR SORRY CENTER NUMBER GETS IN HERE HE THE ALSO THE OTHERS THAT CITY WITH ME AND IF I JUST MAY -- TO PIGGY BACK ON THAT I THINK -- I THINK THIS HERB IS A 100% RIGHT THAT THE BILLS THAT WE PASSED IN -- WE WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS A WHOLE SERIES OF BILLS FROM BOTH HOUSES. TO REALLY TIGHTEN UP THE HOUSING ELEMENT LAW STOP SOME OF THE AVOIDANCE TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN USE LIKE SAY -- WE'RE GONNA PUT OUR LOW INCOME HOUSING ON THIS SITE WE KNOW THAT A TARGET WITH SINCE BUILT THERE TWO YEARS AGO SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE AVAILABLE FIFTY YEARS WITHOUT TO RE DOING. A LOW INCOME HOUSING TO REALLY CUT DOWN. TO RENO. RENO IS SO POLITICIZED AND YOU KNOW AT AT THE REGION GETS ITS AGGREGATE NUMBER AND THAT IT'S A FOOD FIGHT. ABOUT WHAT THE ALLOCATIONS ARE TEACH CITY AND SO WEALTHIER CITIES TEND TO BE ABLE TO PUSH% DOWN THEIR NUMBERS -- AND YOU HAVE SOME OF THESE OUTRAGEOUS DISPARITIES CITING WE'RE GOING TO SEE A REDUCTION AND AND THAT KIND OF APPROACH I THINK THAT'S FAIR MISTER BECAUSE I'M FINDING THAT CITIES ARE DOING THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT. AND THEN THEY DON'T MEET HIM. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PENALTIES SHOW UP OR WHAT HAPPENED I I HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH SB TWO ZONES. SO I'VE GOT CITIES THAT FINALLY FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY SHOULD PUT A HOMELESS SHELTER. AND THEN I GO. WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND I BY A COMMERCIAL BUILDING IN THAT SB TO ZONE FOR TWO HUNDRED BED. HOMELESS SHELTER ONLY BE TOLD BY THE CITY NO WAY YOU'RE NOT GONNA PUT. A SHELTER THERE AND I'M GOING THIS IS YOUR SB TUZLA. SO NOW I HAVE TO BACK OUT OF ESCROW I HAD THAT TWICE SO I'M SITTING HERE SAYING WE GET ALL THESE GREAT LAWS AND ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS. BUT THEY'RE JUST PAYING LIP SERVICE [inaudible] WHAT? AND CAN I ASK OKAY THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THE ABOUT THE SHELTERS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED SB. TWO IN THE LAST PANEL AND I YOU KNOW. WORK YEAH SB T. S. GIVE ME -- SB. BRAVO SIX WITH SIDE ARMS PROPOSITION TWO RIGHT. YOU'RE TRYING TO GET. YOU KNOW. FACILITIES FOR MILLIE ILL HOMELESS PEOPLE SO I'M I'M WORKING ON IT BUT I'M. KIND OF SHARING SOME OF YOUR FRUSTRATIONS BUT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE MAKE EVERYTHING FAIR EQUITABLE UNDERSTANDABLE. AND THEN HOW DO WE HAVE A GOOD RELIABLE FOLLOW THROUGH AND I JUST I JUST NEEDED TO GET THAT OFF MY CHEST MISTER CHAIR THING NO CENTER MORE AYE AYE. AYE INTEGRATE POINT I'VE QUESTION FOR MISS -- FELDMAN -- IS -- WERE YOU MEANT HAVE SITES FOR HOMELESS. SHELTER. AND SO THE QUESTION IS. HOW IS THAT GOING -- AND WE DO HAVE A LIVE ALL THREE BILL THIS YEAR SB FORTY EIGHT AT TEN TEN BILL NOW BUT IT'S GOING. TO IT'S DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE BETTER GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY -- FOR HOMELESS NAVIGATION CENTERS SHELTERS ETCETERA BECAUSE WE HAVE ENTIRE COUNTIES NOW WITH ZERO SHELTER BEDS. COUNTIES THAT ONLY HAVE SHELTER BEDS IN THE WINTER OR HAVE VERY FEW OR DON'T HAVE RUNNING WATER NOTHING FOR YOUTH AND SO ON SO HOW IS THAT GOING TO THANK. STATE JUST AS I SAID THAT. HOUSING ELEMENT. MATTERS IF THE HOUSING ELEMENT BARS RAISED SO JUST AS WE HAS ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SITES FOR FOR ZONING FOR THAT SINGLE FAMILY MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. ZONING FOR SHELTERS COULD ALSO YOU SO THE INITIAL IT'LL PHASE IS I DID JONES WERE SHOCKED WITHOUT DISCRETIONARY REVIEW. BUT THEN WHEN YOU SEE WHERE THOSE SITES ARE LOCATED OR WHERE THERE IS OWNS ARE LOCATED SOMETIMES THAT IS NOT IN TERMS OF WHAT AVAILABLE FUNDING MIGHT BE. WHAT IN TERMS OF WHAT ACCESS THERE MIGHT BE AN AMENITIES THEY MAY NOT BE THE BEST SITES? FOR SHELTERS ALSO THERE MIGHT NOT REALLY BE CAPACITY WITHIN THOSE ZONES FOR SHELTERS THAT COULD REALLY MEET THAT NEED. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN PACKAGE REALLY TIGHTENED UP. THE ADEQUACY OF THE SITES REQUIREMENTS AND NOT RE USING SITES OVER AND OVER AND SOME OF THE OTHER CHANGES. ZONES THAT PERMIT EMERGENCY SHELTERS WITHOUT DISCRETIONARY REVIEW PROBABLY COULD BENEFIT FROM SOME OF THOSE SAME REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT WHAT AMENITIES ARE LOCATED CLOSE TO THOSE ZONES -- AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE USUALLY HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR THE SHELTERS THAT THEY'RE BEING IDENTIFIED SUB. AS YOU AS YOU ALLUDED TO IN HOUSING ELEMENT AS THEY WERE OFTEN THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW A SITE WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE CURRENT USE HAD SOME REDEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL OR AND THAT STILL OCCURS AND SB TWO SITES ARE THE SITES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS WHERE. YES MAYBE THERE'S A CURRENT USE THERE BUT IT'S IT'S NOT THAT THAT USES INCOMPATIBLE WITH EMERGENCY SHELTERS SO WILL OKAY IT -- AND SO TIGHTENING THOSE REQUIREMENTS PROBABLY WOULD BE MORE USEFUL ESPECIALLY NOW IF THERE IS SOME FUNDING AVAILABLE TO BUILD THOSE SHELTERS. WITH UP TO HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS CALL YES CENTER NIELSEN CENTER BELT. QUICKLY WAS FELDMAN. THERE SEEM TO BE A KIND OF A I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD CALL IT A IN EQUITY OR CHEAP SHOT AWHILE BACK. A VERY MINUSCULE CITY IN THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT WAS SINGLED OUT NOT MEETING THEIR REQUIREMENTS. IT'S  RURAL COUNTY IT'S A VERY IN COBB WRIST AREA. THE CITY HAS VERY LIMITED RESOURCES. AND THEY'RE DOING. BUT TRYING. TO BEAT THE GAME. A VERY WEALTHY COUNTY. IN THE BUDGET SLIPPED IN A PROVISION EXTENDING THEIR ELEMENT MANY YEARS. SEEMS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT WOULD OBJECT TO THAT. THAT KIND OF A THAT CERTAINLY IS NOT EQUITABLE. AND THEN LET A A VERY WEALTHY COUNTY JUST EXTENDED FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THERE MAY BE SOME VERY LEGITIMATE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT WHEN I HEARD AND BUDGET COMMITTEE. THAT WAS NOT CONVINCING DOES THAT HAPPEN A LOT. I MIGHT FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT DOES NOT NESTLE HAPPEN A LOT BUT THE IDEA OF KIND OF STRONGER JURISDICTIONS PUSHING SOME OF THE RENO REQUIREMENT ON SMALLER JURISDICTIONS KIND OF TRADING BETWEEN THAT RENO ALLOCATION. YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT INFLUENCE WOULD HAPPEN RIGHT SO THAT IF A STRONGER JURISDICTION IS SAYING. ARMENIA ALLOCATION IS THIS NUMBER AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT IF SOME OF THE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS WOULD TAKE ON SOME OF THAT REQUIREMENT THAT KIND OF TRADING HAS OCCURRED. AND IN OF A JURISDICTION DOESN'T HAVE RESOURCES FOR THE PLANNING STAFF AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE NEEDED TO DEVELOP A HOUSING ELEMENT TO MEET THAT NEED. YOU KNOW THAT CREATES A HEAVIER BURDEN ON THEM BUT DAYS NOT NECESSARILY. IN DETERMINING WHAT THE OVERALL HOUSING NEED NUMBERS ARE YOU AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT SUCH. KIND OF REAL FOUNDED POLICY BECAUSE IT THE IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE OF THE SMALLER ENTITY DOES NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO RESOURCES AND WHATEVER THEY COULD TRADE. TO ADD TO THE ABILITY OF THE RELIEF TO A LARGER MORE WEALTHY COUNTY IT. IT'S BEEN INFINITESIMAL THE YES AND AND THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THAT THAT PROBLEM WILL BE COMPLETELY ELIMINATED BUT AT LEAST A REGION -- PERFORMING AS ALLOCATION FOR THIS NEXT CYCLE WOULD HAVE O DOCUMENT HOW THOSE NUMBERS DOT THERE SO AND YOU KNOW IT IF IT'S GOING TO BE POLITICAL. DECISION MAKING LIKE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. TO SPELL IT OUT AND SHOW HOW THAT WAS AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW COSTS THE DOCTOR CHAU BECAUSE NOW TO SHOW THAT IT WAS STILL IN ALIGNMENT WITH THOSE STATUTORY FACTORS I TALKED ABOUT. AT THE BEGINNING THAT REALLY DO INCLUDE ACT WITH EQUITY THANK YOU THAT'S ENCOURAGING REQUIRE. OUR CENTER BELL FROM START CENTER BELL AND THEN SOME WATER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- THE QUESTION THE QUESTION I HAVE ON THE RENO IS TO DATE TO DO A US. ARE -- DO YOU COLLECT DATA ON THE SIZE OF THE UNITS. LIKE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE IS THAT COLLECTED ANYWHERE [inaudible] I'M. THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION AND AT THE HOUSING ELEMENT STAGE WHEN IT'S A PLANNING REQUIREMENT -- YOU DO HAVE TO SHOW THE CAPACITY OF THE LAND -- SO YOU. YOU WOULD TO A CERTAIN DEGREE. AND I KNOW THE SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT WOULD BE INTENDED FOR THAT SITE. I THINK ON THE OTHER AND I NEED TO CHECK IF THAT WAS ADDED. RIGHT REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT BUT BEDROOMS AYE I DO NOT BELIEVE BEDROOMS WAS INCLUDED SQUARE FOOTAGE JUST AFFORDABILITY AND PRIMER OF UNIT RISE YEAH. THERE'S NO BUT I I COULD BE MISTAKEN NAY BUT WE HAVE QUITE A FEW NEW REQUIRED NEW ADDITIONS TO OUR REPORTING AND I CAN CHECK TO SEE IF IT'S THERE BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS. BECAUSE I THINK THE I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES FOR ME IS THE THE CITY THAT HAS LOW DENSITY BUT THEY BUILD. LARGE SQUARE FOOTAGE. HOUSING NO SINGLE FAMILY WHEREAS. THEY'RE NOT INCLUDING IN THE PLANNING OF A PROJECT SMALLER. MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. OR CONDOS OR WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD SO. THERE'S NO WAY OF JUDGING WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY CAN -- HAVE A LAND USE OF DECISION. THAT WOULD INCLUDE SMALLER. MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. COMPARED TO BUILDING -- A BUNCH OF LARGER. YOU KNOW THAT WHAT'S THE AVERAGE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES BEING BUILT NO. SO A SERVICE WHAT IS IT. TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET -- MAN SOMEBODY'S GOT SOME NUMBER I THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. SO SO LIKE. WHEN I WHEN I LOOK AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING I DON'T SEE ANY? TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS I SEE. THOSE ARE SMALLER HOUSING UNITS. IT -- IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION IT'S HARD. TO TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT SERVE THE COULD BE AFFORDABLE IT MAY NOT FULLY ADDRESS YOUR CONCERN BUT IN THAT HOUSING ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS -- THEY ARE THIS JURISDICTION HAS% THEIR RENA'S ACTUALLY FOUR SEPARATE NUMBERS A VERY LOW INCOME A LOW INCOME A MODERATE AND ABOVE MODERATE GOAL. THEY DO NEED TO SHOW US ZONING FORCE. SMALLER UNITS DENSER UNITS. TO MEET THEIR LOWER INCOME SIDE OF THEIR RECALL SO THAT THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T COUNT. ON SINGLE FAMILY ZONING FOR A FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOME TOWARD THEIR VERY LOW. WIENER CARMEN AT THE HOUSING ELEMENT AT THE PLANNING STAGE. SO HANNAH HANNAH DEVELOPER CAME TALK TO ME ABOUT THE CD PLAYED. FOR A DEVELOPMENT A SMALLER CITY IN. HE HAD -- PRESENTED THE CITY WITH. TWO OPTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE YOU KNOW KIND OF A SMALL PIECE OF PROPERTY. HE SAID -- ONE OF THE OPTIONS HAD TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT -- TOWN HOMES. THE WAS GONNA SELL FOR QUITE A BIT OF MONEY. THERE -- OPTION WOULD BE TO HAVE. TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT TOWN HOMES AND PART OF THE PROPERTY AND THE OTHER PART. HAVE -- ONE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT TOWN HOMES. IN OTHER WORDS HAVE A MIX OF AFFORDABILITY AND HE WAS GOING TO HAVE THOSE. FOUR EIGHT A LOWER AMOUNT HE HAD. YEAH I THINK -- ACTUALLY A VERY SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF UNITS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE. IT WAS ACTUALLY LOWER. SQUARE FOOTAGE. WITH THE ONE THAT HAD THE MORE UNITS THAN -- THE THE ONE I HAD ALL THE TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT UNITS. SO I THINK I THINK FOR ME FOR ME -- WHEN THEY SAY THEY CAN'T BUILD? THEY HAVE TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT UNIT IS IT'S KIND OF A OKAY YOU'RE NOT REALLY. CREATING A YOU HAVE OPTIONS. AND THE OPTIONS IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO MAKE A HIGHER PROFIT IS WHAT I'VE. THAT'S THE OPTION IS NOT ABOUT SUBSIDIES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT -- I CAN MAKE MORE MONEY IF I SO. THE TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSING UNIT. BUT THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY COULD BILL THE OTHER OPTION THE ONE WITH THE ONE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT OPTION THEY JUST WOULD MAKE AS MUCH MONEY. YOU KNOW SO I I THINK THAT'S A FOR ME. FOR ME A AN ISSUE. WITH THE RAIN AND THE RATE OUGHT TO HAVE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE OF THE HOUSING UNITS. HOW HOW MANY HOW MANY UNITS WERE BUILT WHAT SQUARE FOOTAGE AND HOW MUCH THE UNITS COSTS OF COURSE THAT'S THE VALUE ISSUE. THANK YOU AND THERE IS A A BILL PENDING THIS YEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS INTRODUCED THE COP THE PERCENTAGE OF HOUSING ELEMENT. ELEMENT THAT CAN BE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES SOME [inaudible] THE I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON IN A LOT OF THESE COMMUNITIES MISTER CHAIRMAN IS THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF THESE VERY X. THEY'RE TRYING TO BUILD VERY EXPENSIVE CONDOS OKAY AS WHAT'S GOING ON IN AT LEAST IN MY AREA. THERE THERE HIGH DENSITY BUT THERE. VERY EXPENSIVE HIGH DENSITY CONDOS MILLION DOLLAR CONDOS. THERE TOWARD THAT ARE TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT CONDO SUIT VERY HIGH DENSITY. AND I THINK I THINK WHEN THEY HAVE THESE HIGH DENSITY PROJECTS OF THE CITY COULD INSTILL A RAN A FACTOR. TO MEET THE GOALS OF SIMPLY SAYING WE WANT TO MIX. WE WHAT WE WATER MIX OF TYPES OF UNITS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME AFFORDABILITY IN YOUR PROJECT AND THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I HOPE WOULD HAPPEN -- IN THE PROCESS OF WITH ARENA RITA IMPLEMENTATION. I WOULD I WOULD SAY THE TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT CONDOS UNDERMINES DENSITY BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT FEWER UNITS. THANK THANK YOU CENTER SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR I'LL BE VERY UICK -- I I DON'T EVER. WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE MINISTRATION BECAUSE I DON'T BUT I DO BELIEVE SPECIAL SEND THOSE. A JURISDICTION CITIES COUNTIES -- EIGHTY SEVEN THAT WERE NOT MEETING THEIR GOALS I DO BELIEVE THAT THE MINISTRATION. IS TAKING AN APPROACH. OPERATION WITH MANY OF THEM IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH BUT I'LL GIVE ME EXAMPLE ONLY COUNTY. WHO ARE NOWHERE NEAR HITTING THEIR GOALS BECAUSE OF THE FIRES IT'S AN OBVIOUS REASON? THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE OUT LIARS WHO SIMPLY DOES NOT WANTED TO BUILD AFFORDABLE CANDIDLY -- BUT BY THE TWO EXAMPLES THAT I CAN GIVE AT LEAST IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS WOULD BE LAKE COUNTY AND RIO DEL IN RIO DELL IS A SMALL -- COVERAGE COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE JURISDICTIONS IF THEY CAN -- PROVE THEIR CASE AND I THINK THAT -- THE NUMBER SIR WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO LOOK AT THANK YOU. FOR CALLING FOR ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATIVE PANEL -- ON THE HANDLE TO CENTER MCGUIRE FOR THE FINAL FINAL. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- THIS IS BEEN A FANTASTIC HEARING THIS FAR END WE'RE GRATEFUL TO OUR NEXT PANELIST WHO WERE ME BRING YOU WERE GONNA BE CMING UP. WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON STRATEGIES TO FACILITATE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS THEY COME UP WE'RE GONNA INTRODUCE THEM. EATEN L. KIND IS GONNA LEAD US OFF HE CENTER FOR LAW ENERGY IN THE ENVIRONMENT AT UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW HE'S GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THE BENEFITS OF HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT. WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT LEADS LOW IS HERE SHE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEVELOPMENT -- SERVICE DEPARTMENT IN SAN DIEGO. SHE'S GONNA BE FOCUSING ON SAN DIEGO'S EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE HOUSING PRODUCTION IN LINKING TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING WITHIN HAVE ROBERT HUGHES THE PRESIDENT CEO OF ADOBE COMMUNITIES. FOCUSING ON THE NEED TO OPEN UP THE LAND AND BUILD MORE STRATEGICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO DENSITY. AND THEN WE HAVE ERIC PHILLIPS. WHO IS AN ATTORNEY IN VICE PRESIDENT POLICY AND LEGISLATION AT AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION -- HE'S GONNA BE A SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON CENTER BY CAL SKIS FAVORITE ISSUE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS -- CURRENT POLICIES EXAMPLES OF PRACTICES. AT THAT ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT CAME CHALLENGES WE WELCOME OUR FOUR PANELISTS -- TO THE DICE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WE'RE GONNA ASK THAT EACH PANELIST. KEEPS WITHIN A FIVE MINUTE TIME LIMIT IT WILL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND WARNING AS WE GET CLOSE TO THE FIVE MINUTES LET'S START OFF WITH MR AL KIND AND WE WELCOME YOU SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY OKAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TALK ABOUT THE CLIMATE IMPACTS OF I THE CLIMATE PROGRAM ENERGY IN THE IN UC BERKELEY LAWCENTER SKINNER IS ACTUALLY A ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER SO WE THANK HER FOR HER. SERVICE ON OUR BOARD. I'M A IN TERMS OF THE IMPACTS OF DRIVING WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS CHART SHOWS YOU WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN THE STATE SO WE'RE TRYING. TO ACHIEVE NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ACCORDING TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WE ALREADY ACHIEVED THAT GOAL FOUR YEARS EARLY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH IS GOOD NEWS. BUT WE HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE GOAL TO REDUCE THOSE EMISSIONS FURTHER 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY AND THEN 80% BELOW BY. TWENTY FIFTY SO THESE ARE AGGRESSIVE GOALS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IN CALIFORNIA YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS SIDE FROM THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. OVER 40%. COME FROM TRANSPORTATION IF YOU FACTOR IN OIL REFINERY EMISSIONS IT'S CLOSER 250% THAT MEANS HALF OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA ESSENTIALLY COME FROM DRIVING. WHEN OUR HAVE LAND USE PATTERNS ARE A BIG FACTOR IN ALL THAT DRIVING THAT WE DO NOT MANY PEOPLE SAY WELL WE CAN SIMPLY RELY ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES? TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS WE DON'T NEED TO CHANGE OUR LAND USE PATTERNS AT ALL -- BUT THIS CHART HERE FROM THE SCOPING PLAN SHOWS THAT WE STILL NEED ABOUT 15%. VMT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED REDUCTIONS PER CAPITA -- BY THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTY EVEN IF WE HAD A 100% ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE SALES AND THAT'S NOT EVEN INCLUDING THE CARBON BENEFITS OF HAVING MORE INFILL FOCUSED DRIVING -- IN LAND USE PATTERNS BECAUSE AS WE BUILD MORE IN OUR OPEN SPACE FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION AGRICULTURAL LANDS FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION SO WE HAVE MANY REASONS I SHOULD SAY EVEN IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED SHOULD MATTER TO YOU BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC THAT WE ALL HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH AND LOCALIZED AIR POLLUTION AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. SO WE'RE NOT DOING VERY WELL IN THE SCORE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART OF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE BEEN INCREASING SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION WE'RE KIND OF BACK. TO BUSINESS AS USUAL. WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS AND OUR EXISTING URBANIZED AREA THIS IS A CHART FROM STUDY THAT WE DID OUR CENTER ALONG WITH THE TURNER CENTER AND HEARD FROM DAVID GARCIA EARLIER. THAT MODELED WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF WE BUILT TWO MILLION HOMES APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION HOMES THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY WHICH IS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS TELLING US WE NEEDED TO BUILD. WHAT IF WE FOCUSED ALL THAT GROWTH IN LOW VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AREAS? OR AREAS THAT WERE THREE MILE RADIUS FROM AIL STATION SO THAT'S WHAT THIS MAP SHOWS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THIS IS 4% OF THE STATE'S LAND AREA WHERE WE CAN ACCOMMODATE. THESE TWO MILLION NEW UNITS THE AND WE'RE PRETTY MODERATE ASSUMPTIONS RUSSIAN SAID THIS IS ALL ABOUT HIGHRISES THIS WAS A MIX OF SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI FAMILY. BUT CERTAINLY GO BACK A SLIGHT HERE THIS IS A ZOOMED IN VIEW HERE JUST TO SEE WHAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA WE FOUND THAT IF YOU BUILT. OUR HOMES IN THESE AREAS THESE URBANIZED AREAS NEAR TRANSIT WE COULD REDUCE OUR CARBON EMISSIONS BY ALMOST TWO MILLION METRIC TONS EQUIPMENT TO TAKING FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD EVERY YEAR AND THIS IS JUST FROM NEW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE. IF WE PUT OFFICE DEVELOPMENT AND THE BENEFITS TO EXISTING RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS FROM HAVING MORE AMENITIES CLOSER AND IT ALSO PRODUCE HIGHER ECONOMIC GROWTH AND LOWER TRANSPORTATION HOUSING COSTS SO A LOT OF REASONS NOT TO WANT TO BUILD IN THESE COMMUNITIES EVE IN THESE AREAS EVEN IF YOU. DIDN'T CARE AGAIN ABOUT ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE SO IN TERMS OF HOW WE GET TO BE ABLE TO BUILD IN THESE AREAS I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THREE SPECIFIC POLICIES THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE. BECAUSE WE SEE HOSTILITY TO NEW HOUSING GROWTH IN MANY OF THESE AREAS AND IT'S MOSTLY THE FORM OF ZONING WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BUT MANY COMMUNITIES HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE. LOCAL ZONING POLICIES WHICH ARE. BUT MANY PEOPLE MOVE TO EXPAND ESPECIALLY THE HIGHER INCOME COMMUNITIES NOT REALLY WANTING THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO CHANGE NOT EXPECTING MORE GROWTH AND THEY'RE VERY ADAMANT ABOUT ALLOWING NEWCOMERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT THEY HAVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES. SO I WOULD COMMEND SENATOR WIENER FOR SB FIFTY WHICH IS A FOLLOW UP TO SB EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN FROM LAST YEAR WHICH I THINK IS THE RIGHT TYPE OF APPROACH. WHERE WE NEED TO ESSENTIALLY OVERRIDE LOCAL RESTRICTIONS ON HOUSING PARTICULARLY AROUND TRANSIT NOTES? AND I I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THE TERMS OF THE DAMAGE THAT SINGLE FAMILY. ZONING HAS DONE IF YOU LOOK AT LOS ANGELES TWO THIRDS OF LOS ANGELES IS ZONED SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING BACK IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE THAT WAS ONLY 5%. AND I WOULD BET YOU MOST OF THE GREATEST NEIGHBORHOODS IN LOS ANGELES ARE PROBABLY IN THOSE AREAS THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE. NINETEEN THIRTY THREE POLICE LAID OUT BEFORE. NINETEEN THIRTY THREE I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO RELAX THE PERMITTING PROCESS -- IN TERMS OF GETTING THESE OF THESE HOMES APPROVED THROUGH THE PROCESS SEES AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SET UP YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT BEING A BARRIER. TO NEW HOUSING WILL A LOT ABOUT A SELF INFLICTED A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY ADD IN SO MANY DISCRETIONARY REVIEW PROCESS SEES. AND MY COLLEAGUE -- PROFESSOR BIEBER A BERKELEY LAW HAS COME OUT WITH SOME SOME STUDIES ON THIS WHICH WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE AND BECAUSE THEY HAD AN ALL THIS DISCRETION. THAT TRIGGER SEQUENCE THAT THESE ARE MINISTERIAL I ALSO COMMEND SENATOR SKINNER FOR SB -- THREE THIRTY WHICH INTRODUCED WHICH HELPS TO IT -- BASICALLY PUT  CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT WOULD PASS THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS THAT WOULD BE IN PLACE FOR THESE LOCAL APPROVALS BECAUSE THAT ALSO MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IT'S THE ZONING BUT THEN IT'S ALSO THE APPROVAL PROCESS SEES. AND THEN JUST LASTLY I WOULD POINT OUT THE NEED FOR A FINANCING ASSISTANCE NOT ALL OF THESE AREAS ARE IN HIGH INCOME. HIGH GROWTH HIGH JOB GROWTH AREAS THERE IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE -- VERY UNDERSERVED IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE THEY NEED A LOT OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT TO ATTRACT REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT TO THESE AREAS SO THINKING ABOUT A REDEVELOPMENT TWO POINT NO TAX INCREMENT FINANCING. THAT TYPE OF APPROACH WOULD BE -- WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE QUITE SIMPLY PUT. SEC. THIS TYPE OF BUSINESS AS USUAL APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA WITH AUTO ORIENTED HOUSING GROWTH AND CLOGGED HIGHWAYS AND ROADWAYS IS SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE TO MEET OUR LONG TERM CLIMATE GOALS OR THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT WE NEED TO SEE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT THAT'LL ALL CLOSE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANELS OF HAD A CHANCE TO PRESENT THANK YOU. THINK SO MUCH EXTRA KIND YES WE WILL BE TAKING QUESTIONS AS SOON AS WE HAVE EACH OF OUR PRESENTERS. AT PRESENT TO US TODAY WERE NOW WELCOME IS SLOW CITY SAN DIEGO HI FAY ACCORDING TO MR ELK IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IS DOING ALL THE RIGHT THINGS AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT TODAY. I DIDN'T BRING A POWER POINT SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME A LITTLE BIT TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR SAN DIEGANS FIND SOMEWHERE TO LIVE 50% OF SAN DIEGANS CAN'T AFFORD THE HOME THAT THEY LIVE IN. THEY NEED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SALARY IN ORDER TO AFFORD OUR MEDIAN HOME PRICE OF FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO I AM SAN DIEGO HAS CAPITALIZE ON THE CHANGES THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURES IMPLEMENTED LAST SEVERAL SESSIONS INCLUDING PERMITTING OUR GRANNY FLATS WHERE WE'VE SEEN APPLICATIONS GO FROM NINETEEN TO OVER. FOUR HUNDRED AS WELL AS UTILIZING AFFORDABLE HOUSING DENSITY BONUS PROGRAMS. SAN DIEGO'S FIRST IN LINE TO HAVE AN UPDATED HOUSING ELEMENT UNDER THE NEWLY REVISED ARENA PROGRAM SAN DIEGO IS NOT SHYING AWAY FROM MARINO GOALS AND WILL BE AND IS WILLING TO LEAD THE REGION. IN ORDER TO FIND THE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY NEEDED WE NEED TO SEE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW UNITS DEVELOPED IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS TO KEEP PACE WITH OUR DEMAND. IS A VERY DAUNTING NUMBERS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW OUR PERMITTING FIVE THOUSAND UNITS ANNUALLY WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT FIRST AND FOREMOST THE MAYOR IS CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE CITY. THE MARE FAULKNER RECENTLY PROCLAIM SAN DIEGO AS THE NB CITY YES IN MY BACKYARD AND IS ANNOUNCING ADDITIONAL DENSITY BONUS PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE WHILE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE EATEN IN THE OPPOSITION TO INCREASE. INCREASE GROWTH AND DENSITY THEY NEED FOR THE SUPPLY IS CLEAR AND SAN DIEGO IS CHANGING THE RULES TO MAKE HOUSING EASIER TO BUILD. WE'RE REMOVING ARE RESTRICTIVE ZONING THROUGH A SERIES OF COMMUNITY PLAN UPDATES WE HAVE FIFTY TWO NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY PLANNING AREAS AND WE'VE UPDATED TWELVE OF THESE PLANS SINCE THE MAYOR TOOK OFFICE WITH EIGHT MORE IN PROGRESS. IN THESE UPDATES WE ADDED ZONING CAPACITY FOR FORTY THOUSAND NEW UNITS AND WE'RE ON PACE TO ADD A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW UNITS THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE POTENTIAL 425250% MORE UNITS. THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DENSITY BONUS PROGRAM. THROUGH THE PLAN UPDATES WE WILL INCREASES OPPORTUNITIES FOR MINISTERIAL BY RIGHT PROJECTS SO TAKING AWAY THE DISCRETION ALLOWING AT STAFF LEVEL DECISION BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IF YOU NEED TO DO A REZONE. IT TAKES TWO YEARS TO PROCESS A COMMUNITY PLAN AMENDMENT SO HUGE IMPLICATIONS FOR THESE MINISTERIAL PROJECTS. AND INLINE WITH ARE LEGALLY BINDING CLIMATE ACTION PLAN GOALS SAN DIEGO'S INCENTIVIZE HOUSING IN OUR TRANSIT RIORITY AREAS. SO MOST RECENTLY YESTERDAY SAN DIEGO CITY COUNCIL PASSED SWEEPING PARKING REFORMS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT NEAR TRANSIT. ELIMINATING ALL PARKING MINIMUM CARLOS THEIR MAJOR TRANSIT STOPS THE TRANSIT PRIORITY AREA COVERS ALMOST HALF OF SAN DIEGO'S DEVELOPER WILL LAND. AND WAS STUDIED EXTENSIVELY FOR PARKING USAGE 89% OF THE SITES SURVEYED IN THE TRANSIT PRIORITY AREA UNDER UTILIZED THOSE PARKING SPACES. THE NEW POLICY ALLOWS FOR ON BUNDLING PARKING REQUIRES DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE MORE TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES LIKE SUBSIDIZED TRANSIT PASSES WE ALREADY REDUCE THE PARKING RATIOS FOR AFFORDABLE UNITS. AND NOW WE'LL SEE MANY MORE UNITS WERE PARKING SPACES IS NO LONGER INCLUDED IN THE PRICE GIVING SAN DIEGANS AND NEW CHOICE TO BE CAR FREE. WITH THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN CALIFORNIA I OVERSEE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES WE ISSUE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PERMITS A YEAR WE'RE CONSTANTLY REVIEWING OUR BUSINESS PROCESS THESE AND TRY TO FIND WAYS TO SHAVE TIME OFF THE PROCESS. INFILL DEVELOPMENT COMPLICATED YOU GOT TO BE AN EXPERT TO GET THROUGH THIS PROCES AND EVEN IF YOU'RE BUILDING BY RIGHT YOU STILL HAVE TO COME IN AND GET MECHANICAL PLUMBING ELECTRICAL FIRE SAFETY JOLLITY STORM WATER TRANSPORTATION IMPACT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES. KERR BETTER SIDEWALK FLOODING FEMA PARKING BIKE LANES LANDSCAPE HEIGHT SET BACK THAT'S ALL YOUR MINISTERIAL PERMIT NO WONDER IT TAKES SIX MONTHS -- BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE IT EASIER TO GET YOU THROUGH THESE BASIC CODE REQUIREMENTS SO ADMINISTRATIVELY WE CHANGED OUR PROCESS TO BE LESS ITERATIVE. LESS BACK AND FORTH WE ARE INPUT INSTITUTING A NEW PROCESS WHERE YOU WILL GO THROUGH ONE REVIEW CYCLE AND COME BACK YOU WILL BRING IN YOUR LICENSE ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS AND WE WILL SIT AT THE TABLE I WILL PROBLEM SOLVED TO GET IT DONE THAT DAY. IT'S CALLED OUR PERMIT NOW PROGRAM I'M DOING IT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS AND I HOPE TO HAVE MORE OF THAT HAPPENED WITHIN THE CITY. RECENTLY THIS PROCESS SAVED AN APPLICANT FOR MONTHS AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE PERMIT. FINALLY WE'RE EXCITED TO BE MOVING INTO THIS CENTURY WITH DIGITAL DST AND ELECTRONIC PERMITTING AND WE THINK THAT THAT'LL SAVE APPLICANTS TIME AND MONEY IT'S NOT ON YEAH BUT WE'RE MAKING IT HAPPEN. SO PERMIT PROCESSING IS EASIER WE'VE REDUCED THE NEED FOR DISCRETIONARY REQUIREMENTS WE NO LONGER REQUIRE PLANNING COMMISSIONER CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL FOR EVERY DEVIATION FOR A SET BACK OR OR HIGH WE NOW HAVE PUBLICLY NOTICE STAFF LEVEL DECISIONS THAT ARE APPEALABLE TO OUR PLANNING COMMISSION. SAVING PROJECTS SIX MONTHS DOLLARS WE ALSO EVEN CHANGE ALL PROJECTS CAN BE APPEALED WE RAISE THE APPEAL FEE TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BE COST RECOVERABLE IN LINE WITH OTHER CITIES. AND WE MANDATED THAT APPEALS BE DOCKET IT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE -- AT FOR YOU IS THAT SAN DIEGO IS COMPLETELY ON BOARD WITH THE STATE'S GOALS FOR INCREASING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADDITIONAL TOOLS ARE NEEDED FOR SAN DIEGO TO IMPLEMENT STATE LEGISLATION MORE QUICKLY. FOR BILLS WITH AN OPT IN THE PROVIDED GREAT GUIDING POLICY FRAMEWORK BUT IF THE SECRET DOCUMENT HAS TO BE COMPLETED BY A LOCAL AGENCY THAT JUST ADDS ANOTHER YEAR TO OUR PROCESS THIRTY SECONDS CITIES IMPLEMENTING STATE LEGISLATION NEEDS STREAMLINED ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS FROM THE STATE IT WILL HELP SAVE TIME. AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND DOLLARS AND HELP US AVOID POTENTIAL LITIGATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO MUCH IS LOW YOU APPROVED IT. WE DO NOT NEED POWER POINT TO HIS JOB A SEVERITY GO S. WORK. BUT WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE MISUSE HERE SHE'S PRESIDENT CEO OF ADOBE COMMUNITIES TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD MORE DENSELY MISUSED FORESHORES HAVE FIVE MINUTES -- GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND HEADS UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE I REALLY APPRECIATED IN ADDITION TO BEING THE PRESIDENCY OF ABOUT COMMUNITIES I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM ON ON THE BOARD AND HOUSING POLICY TEARS THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO ARE YOU NOT MY FIRST FEW SLIDES ARE REALLY ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY WITH THE MOVE MY LOOK AT A LOCAL CLOSER OKAY THANK YOU. WHICH WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT TODAY WHICH IS -- ARE THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS VERY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS UNTIL THIS FIGHT JUST SORT OF DEMONSTRATE NUMBERS THAT YOU SEE YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN TODAY -- A MOMENT OKAY -- OTHER BIRD COMMUNITIES WE WORK TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS AND AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS SPEAKERS TODAY IT'S REALLY ABOUT WHO'S IMPACTED BY THIS CRISIS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WHEN FAMILIES AND SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS MOVING TOWARD BUILDING. IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THEIR LIVES WE SEE FAMILY. FAMILIES EXPERIENCING GREATER STABILITY AND IN THEIR LIVES YOU SEE KIDS DOING BETTER IN SCHOOLS WE SEE -- SENIORS WHO ARE ABLE TO LIVE LONGER INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR HOMES. AND WE SEE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS OR HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS HAVE THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED TO STAY STABLE IN THEIR HOME BUT WE WHAT WE ALSO SEE ON THE OTHER END OF THAT AROUND THE ISSUES AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF THAT TODAY BOTH IN TERMS OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPACTED. BUT BUT OUR LAND USE -- AVAILABILITY IS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND THAT THEIR NEW THERE NEEDS TO BE INNOVATIVE ZONING SOLUTION AND REGULATIONS THAT EXPEDITE THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THEN STUDIES TO SORT OF HOW HOW THIS IS THE FIRST ONE IS A PROJECT THAT WE ARE FINISHING CONSTRUCTION ON AND SOUTH LOS ANGELES RULING CURRY'S GARDENS. WHAT WAS REALLY -- SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS FROM A LAND USE PERSPECTIVE SO THIS IS THE GENTRIFYING NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT ACROSS FROM YOU SEE WHERE WE'VE SEEN A GREAT LOSS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY WAS ON THE MARKET. AND COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR MARKET RATE HOUSING SO ARE OUR GOALS HERE WAS TO PRESERVE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IN THIS COMMUNITY. TO INCREASE DENSITY AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE SLIDE IT'S RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE ACTUAL SITE. INTO COMBAT GENTRIFICATION THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD THROUGH LOCAL ZONING AND LAND USE WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE HIS FORTY EIGHT YOU NAY GARDEN STYLE APARTMENT. AND AND DEVELOP A HUNDRED AND FORTY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AT REDUCE PARKING INCORPORATED COMMUNITY FACILITY IT'S A GREAT PROJECT BUT IT HAD SOME CHALLENGES AND I THINK IT'S CHALLENGES THAT LAND USE COULD DEFINITELY ADDRESS. WE HAD A LINK THE LINK THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS EVEN AFTER SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND THERE WAS AN APPEALS PROCESS THAT THE AND EXTENDED THE THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. SO THIS PROJECT REQUIRED AS OWN CHANGE GENERAL PLAN AND THEN MATT AND WE ALSO UTILIZE THE DENSITY BONUS. IF ANY AND IF IT WERE ENDING CONSTRUCTION DOWN [inaudible] THE VOTE WE COULD HAVE DELIVERED pWE THINK ABOUT LAND USE AND THE PRESENTATION YOU SAW FROM MR GARCIA EARLIER. AND HEARD TODAY IT'S JUST THE THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE AVAILABILITY OF MULTI FAMILY HOUSING ZONE FOR MULTI FAMILY. AND THEN ARE NEED TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW AS I'VE LOOKED AT POLICY IS. CAN WE LOOK AT WAYS T. TO DEAL WITH ITS OWN CHANGE IN GENERAL PLAN BY. NOT JUST LOOKING AT THE ISOLATED SITE BUT WHAT'S PRECEDENT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR HOW. THINGS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AGAIN THIS SITE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD BILL BACK IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND THIRTIES PRIMARILY SINGLE FAMILY DUPLEXES BUT OVER TIME IT'S BEGAN TO DEVELOP AT THE CHASE IMPARTS PARCELS WERE JUST NOT THERE YET. IS THERE A WAY -- TO TO SOME PRECEDENTS OWNING NOT JUST BASED UPON THE ADJACENT PROPERTIES BUT WITH THE PRESIDENT THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THIRTY SECONDS SURE -- I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT WAS A PROJECT THAT WE DO WITH LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THAT THE PURPOSE OF TIS ONE IS REALLY TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING AVAILABLE PUBLICLY OWNED THE LAND TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THIS CASE WERE ABLE TO DO THIS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LA U. S. T. AND DELIVER NOT ONLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC BUT ALSO. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THEIR LOWER WAGE WORKFORCE ALSO HAVING AVAILABLE PUBLIC PLAN IS REALLY REALLY CRITICAL AND THEN I JUST WANT. TO GET TO MY LAST SLIDE WHICH IS A PROJECT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT TO THE LIES IN THE TRANSIT ORIENTED DID COMMUNITIES DOWN THE LOS ANGELES. AND I REALLY JUST FEEL LIKE THAT IS A REALLY GREAT MOM AND INCLUDING OF BUT ALSO YOUR PERCENT AFFORDABLE HAVE THAT INTEL'S GREAT AND THAT ENOUGH. DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS BUT ALSO THE ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT SO IF THERE QUESTIONS LATER ON I CAN DEFINITELY TALK MORE ABOUT THE TOC. SO -- AGAIN I THINK THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO YOU AND XCELERATED PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT CREATING INCENTIVES AND TOOLS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO IMPROVE THEIR COMMUNITY PLANS INCREASE SOUNDING AND BRING MORE RESOURCES THIS CRAP. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS YOU SPREE GRATEFUL THANKS CHOP TODAY. WERE -- GRATEFUL THAT MISTER PHILLIPS IS HERE HE IS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF POLICY LEGISLATION FOR THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. AND HE'S GONNA BE DOING A DEEP DIVE ON GRANNY UNITS AS WE ALSO CALL EXCESS READ WILLING UNITS ALSO SOON TO BE CALLED A Y. CASKEY DWELLING UNIT SO -- THERE WE GO MISTER PHILLIPS THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES SO GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND AD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR AND AND THANK YOU TO THE WHOLE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME AND TEAR YOUR STAFF FOR ENGAGING WITH US AHEAD OF TIME I'M HAPPY. TO BE HERE. AS YOU POINTED OUT ON BEHALF CHEN. WE ARE A PROFESSIONAL -- TREAT ORGANIZATION WE HAVE -- APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- THAT REPRESENT PROFESSIONAL PLANNERS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE -- SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- WITH AN EFFORT OF YOU BUILDING GREAT COMMUNITIES THROUGH PLANNING AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMMENTS TODAY ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ZONING OBVIOUSLY THAT. AS A PROFESSION BEING A PLANNER TODAY IN CALIFORNIA I FEEL WE ARE RESPONSIBLE. TO ADDRESS AND RECTIFY THAT THE HISTORY THAT -- PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT TODAY AND ONE OF THE TOOLS FOR DOING THAT I BELIEVE ARE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS -- EIGHTY USE GRANNY FLATS DAVID D'ARCY AND FROM THE THE TURNER CENTER ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES TO DEVELOPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING TODAY AND TWO OF THE HEIGHT CHALLENGES ON HIS LIST WERE LAND AFFORDABILITY. AND NEIGHBORHOOD OPPOSITION AND ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS -- HELP SOLVE BOTH OF THOSE PROBLEMS THE LAND IS ALREADY DEVELOPED WE KNOW WHERE IT IS AND THEY TEND TO BE EITHER SMALLER UNITS ARE DEVELOPED WITHIN STRUCTURES THAT ALREADY EXISTS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD OPPOSITION IS IS LESS AND THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF DISCUSSION THROUGHOUT EACH OF THE PANELS. ABOUT EQUITY AND I BELIEVE EIGHTY USE ASO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS -- EQUITABLE ASPECTS OF LAND USE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT I'M TO THE EXTENT THAT EIGHTY USE ARE DEVELOPED IN AREAS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE PRICES. THAT INCREASES OPPORTUNITIES -- TO HOUSEHOLDS THAT THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE IN THOSE AREAS -- ALSO IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE. LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OR HOMEOWNERS IN AREAS THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN UNDER SERVED -- DEVELOPING AN EIGHTY ON THEIR PROPERTY CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD EQUITY IN AN INCOME STREAM SO -- IT CAN HELP ADDRESS AND KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED. IN THEIR THEIR LONG TERM NEIGHBORHOODS -- BUT ALL OF THAT IS RELATED SURE THAT IT'S THAT LOCAL -- EIGHT ARE REALLY INCREASING EIGHTY YOU PRODUCTION IN THE RIGHT PLACES AND INCREASING AFFORDABILITY -- I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF I'M JURISDICTIONS THAT I THINK ARE DOING -- GOOD GOOD EFFORTS. TO PROMOTE EIGHTY YOU DEVELOPMENT -- FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA. AND THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO WAIVE DEVELOPMENT FEES ON EIGHTY YEARS BUT ONLY FOR SMALLER EIGHTY USE THAT CREATES AN INCENTIVE TO BUILD SMALLER UNITS WHICH AS WAS DISCUSSED BEFORE ARE MORE AFFORDABLE. A LARGE EIGHTY YOU THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT IT WOULD BE AFFORDABLE IT CAN RENT FOR AS MUCH AS A MARKET RATE UNIT -- BUT CREATING INCENTIVES FOR SMALL EIGHTY USE MAKES SENSE THE OTHER ADVANTAGE OF THAT STRATEGY IS THAT A SMALLER EDU IS LESS LIKELY TO BURDEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE ANDSERVICES IN A JURISDICTION -- IF YOU'RE ALLOWING IT BUT BUT TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT AT YOU THAT HAS THE SAME IMPACT IN MANY CASES AS A SMALL SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE AND THAT'S THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE HOME I LIVE IN BERKELEY AND THE EXEMPTING THAT TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT FROM FEES. DOESN'T MAKE AS MUCH SENSE SO -- KEEPING AND USING THIS THEFEE WAIVER AS A WAY TO CREATE AN INCENTIVE TO DEVELOP SMALLER MORE AFFORDABLE EIGHTY USE IS A GREAT TOOL -- ALSO -- FROM IN THE SAME REGION BUT NAPA COUNTY -- HAS A LOAN PROGRAM HELP FINANCE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A TO USE AS LONG AS THOSE EIGHTY USE OUR DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS AND THAT HELPS CONTROL WHO HAS ACCESS TO THEM AND WHO BENEFITS FROM IT -- WHILE OFFSETTING THE COSTS TO THE HOMEOWNERS -- ALSO BRING UP AN EXAMPLE FROM -- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE JURISDICTION OF AND SOME NEED US ANOTHER ON THAT THE FORTY SEVEN LIST BUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE BUT WHEN I AM EFFORT THAT THEY'VE DONE THAT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL TOWARDS PROMOTING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. IS THERE -- CITY COMMISSION PRE APPROVED PLANS FOR EIGHTY USE -- SO THEY HAVE A SUITE OF NINE DIFFERENT EDIE YOU PLAN SETS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR FREE TO THE PUBLIC THAT THEY KNOW HAVE BEEN PRE PERMITTED PRE APPROVED. THEY CAN COME AND THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR OWN -- LITERAL THEIR SITE DESIGN AND THEIR ARCHITECT TO DO THE CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS -- BUT IT SAVES TIME IT SAVES MONEY -- SO IT INCENTIVIZE THE CREATION AND AT A LOWER COST FOR THE HOMEOWNER -- SO AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WE INCENTIVES -- I'D ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT. SOME. OTHER PLANNING PRINCIPLES THAT RUN THROUGH GETTING GETTING READY FOR EIGHTY YEARS AND ACTUALLY SOME OF THEM APPLIED AT THE STREAMLINING AND AND CONVERSATIONS THAT -- SENATOR MCGUIRE WAS BRINGING UP EARLIER IN THE THAT PANEL -- BUT ABOUT A CONTEXT SENSITIVITY. THE ANSWERS THAT WORK IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT THE SAME THAT THAT WORK IN OTHERS AND PARTICULARLY -- WITHIN RURAL PORTIONS OF THE STATE -- AS AN ORGANIZATION AN EPA WOULD WOULD SUPPORT -- EIGHTY USE AND ALMOST ANY A ONE SINGLE EIGHTY YOU IN ALMOST ANY EXISTING STRUCTURE -- BUT THEN LOOKING AT MORE INTENSIFICATION THAN THAT AND RURAL CONTEXT -- RUNS THE RISK OF POTENTIALLY. ALLOWING TOO MUCH DEVELOPMENT OUTSIDE OF AREAS THAT ARE WELL SERVED BY TRANSIT INCREASING V. M. T. NGH T. EMISSIONS. AND BEING IN CONFLICT WITH THE AGRICULTURAL AND PRESERVATION EFFORTS -- I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION SIR THANK YOU THE DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN. URBAN AND RURAL WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY AND AND FIRE HAZARDS -- ALLOWING INTENSIFIED DEVELOPMENT -- IN. EVEN IF YOU TAKE AN X. -- THE RULES THAT WORK THERE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THE RULES IN PARADISE -- TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. THE LAST THING THAT I WILL I WILL COVER -- BEFORE MY TIME EXPIRES IS. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PLANNING FOR GROWTH AND THAT PUTTING THE GROWTH IN AREAS THAT CAN ABSORB-IT -- ALLOWING EASY USE AGAIN AND URBAN AREAS THAT ARE WELL SERVED BY MUNICIPAL SERVICES MAKES A LOT OF SENSE -- BUT THOSE SEEM RULES DON'T NECESSARILY APPLY IN RURAL CONTEXT WHERE WERE SERVED BY -- SEPTIC SIR WELL AND THEY CAN ABSORB THE SAME AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK THAT THAT SAME CONCEPT RUNS THROUGH -- SOME OF THE THE STREAMLINING AND AND OTHER EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE PLANNING FOR THE GROWTH IS PART OF MAKING SURE THAT THE GROWTH HAPPENS AND I'LL I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON ANY OF THOSE TOPICS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUPPOSED VERY GRATEFUL. WITH A BIT OPEN IT UP FROM THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR START WITH SENATOR ABOUT. I LIKE THE MEMBERS. TO THE PANEL TO MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT. IN IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY YOU THINK WE OUGHTA. START LIVING IN SMALLER HOUSING WHICH THE YOU KNOW LIKE. YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE WITH OKAY -- ALSO THIS BECAUSE I'M OLDER THAN ALL YOU PEOPLE. WHEN I WAS A KID -- YOU KNOW WE WE OF COURSE OUR FAMILY WE HAD TWELVE IN OUR FAMILY BUT I FIGURED OUT IT WAS ABOUT. NINETY SQUARE FEET PER. PERSON IN OUR FAMILY I DON'T KNOW. SOME OF YOU LIVED IN THAT WITH TWELVE PEOPLE ON A THREE BEDROOM TWO BATH HOUSE [inaudible] SO [inaudible] YOU KNOW [inaudible] BUT BUT JUST THE WAY THE WAY THIS SIZE OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HOUSING UNIT. AND AND DO YOU THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM. WITH AFFORDABILITY IS THAT. THE HOUSING STOCK THAT WE HAVE THE IS JUST GETTING. MORE OF THESE LARGE. MORE EXPENSIVE THERE NEVER THERE DOES KIND OF UNITS ARE NEVER GOING. TO FILTER DOWN. TO AFFORDABILITY AT ALL YOU KNOW THE ODD BUT I LIKE TO HEAR THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE SIZE -- OF THE HOUSING UNITS THAT WE APPROVING CALIFORNIA. WHERE THEY WERE GOING WELL I CAN ADDRESSES RELIEF AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE A SMALLER UNIT IS DEFINITELY CARRYING ON A MUCH SMALLER? CARBON FOOTPRINT -- YOU HAVE MUCH LESS -- ENERGY USAGE WATER USAGE AND IF YOU'RE CLOSER TO JOBS SERVICES RETAIL YOU CAN WALK BIKE TAKE TRANSIT OR IF YOU DO HAVE TO DRIVE OR NOT TO BE DRIVING AS FAR AS IF YOU'RE IN AN OUTLYING AREAIN A BIGGER HOME. SO THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE FOR A HOUSING SCENARIO WHERE IF YOU HAD A MORE COMPACT INFILL TYPE OF HOUSING SCENARIO YOU COULD SAY PEOPLE A LOT OF MONEY. IN THE QUESTIONS WE DON'T WANNA BE REQUIRING PEOPLE EVEN THOUGH THAT'S A SENSITIVE SUBJECT RIGHT PEOPLE SO WILL CLIMATE POLICIES GONNA REQUIRES ALL THE LIVE IN SOME RABBIT HUTCH IN A IN A DENSE HONG KONG LIKE CITY AND THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TO MEET OUR CLIMATE. GOALS IT'S REALLY NOT PROVIDING THE OPTION OF A SMALLER UNIT THAT REDUCES PEOPLE NOT ONLY THEIR ENERGY COSTS BUT THERE TRANSPORTATION COSTS TO AND WE'RE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH OF THOSE SMALLER UNITS I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTE CORRECT THAT BECAUSE OUR INFILL AREAS ARE MAJOR JOB CENTERS HAVE. RESTRICTED HOUSINGGROWTH IT'S PUSHED OUT HOUSING OUT TO EDGE COMMUNITIES WHERE BUILDERS ARE BUILDING BIGGER PRODUCT BUT WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THOSE ENERGY COSTS AS TRANSPORTATION COSTS IT'S PUTTING A HUGE SQUEEZE ON CALIFORNIANS AND WE'RE REALLY STARTING TO HEMORRHAGE. MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTS AS A RESULT. I JUST LIKE TO ADD TO THAT THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR QUESTION I AS NEAR QUESTION IN THE LAST PANEL AS WELL AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT SAN DIEGO IS GOING TO TACKLE THIS IS TO TRY. TO INCENTIVIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALLER UNITS BY AM CHANGING AND THE SCALE OF OUR DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES RIGHT NOW IT'S THE SAME DEVELOPMENT IMPACT THE WHETHER YOU BUILD A TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT UNIT OR SIX HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT UNIT. SO THAT'S A THAT'S A STUDY THAT THAT WERE WORKING ON AND WE HOPE TO TO CHANGE THOSE FEES TO INCENT THOSE SMALLER UNITS. THANK YOU. THE THE SIMPLE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS YES -- BUT BUT I WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT FROM AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PERSPECTIVE AND WE'RE WE'RE BUILDING AND I FEEL LIKE. THE THE PRODUCTS THAT WERE BILL. OUR ART IN GENERAL ARM FOR OUR APPROPRIATE AND ME WE ARE PROBABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND YOU KNOW TWELVE THIRTEEN HUNDRED FOR A THREE BEDROOM UNITS SO THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT YOUR FAMILY WITH US ONE HOUSE. RIGHT -- YOURS WAS THE 1-000-010-0050 SQUARE FEET SELECT A BRIGHT SO I I FEEL LIKE -- SO HE'S DOING RIGHT WITHIN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INDUSTRY WE'VE DEFINITELY GOTTEN TO A PLACE OF BUILDING COMPACT EFFICIENT UNITSTO MATCH THE HOUSEHOLD CIDER POPULATION THAT WERE SERVING. AND SERVED THERE'S A A FEW THEMES THAT ARE BETTER AND PLAY WITH AN EIGHT I TOUCHED ON ONE OF THEM BRIEFLY WITH THE IN THE EIGHTY YOU CONTEXT AS A SMALLER EIGHTY YOU IS IS LESS LIKELY TO MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFORDABLE AND LESS LIKELY TO BURDEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND IN. THE SAME WAY A LARGER ONE WAY SO THAT HAS A A DOUBLE BENEFIT THERE -- BUT IT AT THE SAME TIME -- TO PICK UP ON A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT MS HUGHES WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE STILL PLANNING -- FOR FAMILIES AND AND AND HOW ONE THIRD ONLY BE ONE HOUSING TYPOLOGY OBVIOUSLY -- BEING ABLE TO BUILD MORE EFFICIENTLY -- IS. IS AN IMPORTANT AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY TO OF CONTROLLING COSTS AND INCREASING DENSITY TO PROVIDE MORE OPTIONS -- BUT AT THE SAME THERE IF THERE IS. IT WILL NEVER TOTALLY GO AWAY TO HAVE HAVE THE DEMAND FOR LARGER UNITS ARE LUXURY UNITS THERE CAN BE ROOM FOR THAT IN THE MARKET. AS LONG AS THAT'S NOT COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF MEETING THE OTHER NEEDS THAT ARE ARE OUT THERE I THINK I THINK WHAT I'M SEEING IN SAN JOSE AND SILICON VALLEY IS. THERE'S A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT FELICE E. [inaudible] THE VALLEY. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE THERE IS. THEY CAN BUY THEY CAN IT WENT TO THEM AFFORDABILITY IS TO BUY -- A THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE. YOU'RE ON THE MOVE OUT AND TRACY ERRORS -- MODESTO OR SOMEPLACE PATTERSON OF THERE ARE MY COMMUTING AS LONG AS THEY GO BACK TO THAT THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE. AND I THINK THERE'S SOME KIND OF WITH THE SOME WRONG WITH THAT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF LIKE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TRANSPORTATION ALL THE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND WE HAVE TO TURN AROUND TO REWARD PEOPLE THAT -- ONE LIVE IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT AND AND FROM A PLANNING STANDPOINT SO. RESTAURANT THANK YOU NO THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER ABOUT VERY GRATEFUL. TURN OVER CENTER Y. CALFSKIN IN SENATOBIA. SO THIS IS A SECTION ON STRATEGIC COURSE SPECIFIC STRATEGIES AND THERE IS SOME TENSION BETWEEN LOOK LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE. JUST MENTION THAT -- AND I GUESS IN THE EIGHTY YOU CONTENT WE HAD WE PASSED THE BILL IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THAT SAID EVERYBODY NEEDED TO EVERY CITY HAD THE PASSAGE. A SECOND UNIT PORTENTS AND EVERYBODY PASSED TO SET ALL FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CITIES PASSED SECOND UNIT ORDINANCE AND YOU LOOK AT THAT FIFTEEN YEARS OR TWELVE YEARS BETWEEN. TWO THOUSAND THREE AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BEFORE. SB TEN SIXTY NINE GOT IT AND THERE WAS LIKE ONE UNIT TO UNIT ZERO UNITS ZERO UNITS SO THEY ALL HAVE THESE BILL FELT GOOD ABOUT THEIR LOSS TO DATE BUT NOTHING GOT BUILT. SEDAN NOW GOING -- TO TO SIXTEEN LOCAL ORDINANCES FOUR EIGHT IF HE DIDN'T COMPLY WITH TEN SIXTY NINE THEY DIDN'T HAVE YOU KNOW THE REQUIRED -- PARKING IN THE BOOK PARKING WAS REQUIRED WITHIN TRANSIT NONE THE ROLLER IS BETWEEN TRANSIT. ONLY TWO HUNDRED OF THE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CITIES HAVE PASS NEW EIGHTY YOU ORDINANCES. FOR THE CAT NOT EVEN HALF SOME FOR COMPLYING WITH STATE LAWS BUT OTHERS USE WE SIT HERE ON YEAR. THREE AND SOME OF US ARE CHATTERING ABOUT THE IMPACT FEES TEN AND HOMEOWNERSHIP WHICH I BELIEVE IS NOT A GOOD INCENTIVE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IT RESTRICTS. HOW CAN YOU HELP US OUT WITH THIS STRATEGY WE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE'RE SAYING THIS IS WHT WE WANT YOU TO GO? BACK IN 200-022-00016 AND THEIR SISTER FINANCE. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN WE'VE SAID YOUR YOUR LONG ANSWER FOR YOU AND THEY'RE STILL PASSING THEY'RE STILL IN FORCING TEN THOUSAND MINIMUM LOT SIZE FOR AN EIGHTY YOU FOR INSTANCE. STRATEGY SOME ASSISTANCE I KNOW SAN DIEGO HAS ACTUALLY DONE A LOT OF OLD JOB. IT WILL. THE TWENTY SIXTEEN LAWS I THINK WERE OBSERVER VERY EFFECTIVE I MEAN YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THERE'S NOT 1100% COMPLIANCE BUT THE THERE'S BEEN A BLOOM AND EIGHTY YOU CONSTRUCTION -- THROUGHOUT JURISDICTIONS AND IT'S IT'S JUST RETURN THAT TO PART OF THE CONVERSATION A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS. BUT MAYBE HAD ONE ON THE BOOKS BUT WERE IN NOW. REINVESTED IN TRYING TO PROMOTE THAT SO A THE ATTENTION THAT'S BEEN RETURNED TO HIS BÃ N -- REALLY HELPFUL EIGHT I THINK THAT -- IN SOME WAYS. GIVING THEN THE THE LAWS THAT ARE NOW ON THE BOOKS TIME TO WORK AND CONTINUE TO WORK. IN THAT CONTEXT IS GOOD BUT BROADENING YOU. DO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW DO YOU. MAKE SURE THAT JURISDICTION'S ARE COMPLAINING I FEEL. THAT -- ACTUALLY THE THE EIGHTY YOU THE TWENTY SIXTEEN EIGHTY YOU LEGISLATION IS A GOOD MODEL BECAUSE IT SET VERY SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE STANDARDS ABOUT WHERE THINGS NEEDED TO BE -- PERMITTED IT ALLOWED THE JURISDICTION SOME DISCRETION TO GO THROUGH A PLANNING PROCESS AND COME UP WITH. THEIR LOCAL STANDARDS BUT THEN ONCE THOSE WERE SAT IT'S A MINISTERIAL TIME LIMITED APPROVAL PROCESS THERE'S NO MORE SEEK WEATHER'S NO MORE -- OPPORTUNITY FOR NAME BE INVOLVEMENT SO HAVING. THE THAT SORT OF DYNAMIC BETWEEN THE STATE'S SETTING PARAMETERS GIVING. WITH SPECIFIC IN TIME REQUIREMENTS AND CONSEQUENCES -- BUT GIVING CITIES THE OPPORTUNITY THEN. TO TO COMPLY AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THE STATE'S STANDARDS SET THE BASELINE AND AND THEY'VE MISSED OUT ON THEIR OPPORTUNITY. THAT'S THEIR CHOICE THAT MODEL SEEMS TO TO WORK PRETTY WELL IN TERMS OF CREATING -- AN INCENTIVE FOR CITIES TO COMPLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME PLANNING WORK AND THEN HAVING -- CONSEQUENCES IF THEY DON'T. SEE YOUR QUESTION GOES BEYOND THE EIGHTY YEARS I'M I WOULD SAY AND WORKING WITH ANY STATE LEGISLATION THAT'S COME DOWN LOCALLY FROM WAY BACK WITH SB EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN TO OTHER. SORT OF MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS THAT DEALT WITH IT YOU KNOW THE EIGHTY SIX CITIES AT THE LA COUNTY THEY ALL IMPLEMENTED VERY DIFFERENTLY. AND SOME CHOOSE -- TO DOT TEMPERAMENT THESE -- POLICIES SO I THINK THERE IS THERE IS I THINK MORE THAT COULD BE PUT IN PLACE IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND WHAT COULD HAPPEN AND WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES ONE POLICIES ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED AND MAYBE THERE'S A HOUSING. SPECIALIST WITHIN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THEIR JOB IS TO LOOK AT HOW LOCALITIES ARE IMPLEMENTING -- LAND USE POLICY BUT THE THE OTHER THING IS CAN WE TIE INCENTIVES OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AT THE STATE LEVEL TO AYE THEIR REWARD THROUGH CITIES THAT ARE DOING RIGHT WELL AROUND THOSE HOT THERE HOUSING POLICY OR I DON'T WANT TO SAY -- PUNISH BUT YOU KNOW TÃI INCENTIVES. TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE HOUSING POLICIES AS WELL. AND I THINK I JUST LIKE THE TO QUICKLY ADD IN TERMS OF THE STRATEGY AND WE WE ARE PERMITTING A LOT MORE EIGHTY USE NOW. PREVIOUSLY WE PERMITTED A LOT OF GUEST QUARTERS RIGHT SO THAT'S THE SAME UNIT BUT WITHOUT THAT KITCHEN FACILITY AND SO. PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF A LOCAL AND THE GUEST QUARTERS THAT ACTUALLY DATA NOW HAVE. KITCHENS -- IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY -- THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO SET ASIDE -- FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF OUR GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO WAIVE THE WATER AND SEWER FEES CITY COUNCIL APPROVED WEIGHING THAT ARE WAVING THAT THE DIFFIE IS -- SANDBAG JUST WAVE TO OUR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION FEE SO WE'VE NOW WAVED. UPWARDS OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEES AND IF SOMEONE CAN CAPITALIZE ON IN CITY THIS IS FREE DESIGN TEMPLATES MAYBE THEY CAN SAVE ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE SO WE'VE JUST SHAVED FORTY GRAND. OFF OF THE PROXIMATE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUILD AN EIGHTY SO THAT'S THAT'S SIGNIFICANT AND I I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THOSE NUMBERS WILL CONTINUE. I THINK A LOT OF GREAT POINTS HERE RAISED I WOULD JUST SAY YOU DESCRIBE AS ATTENTION CENTER RIGHT HOUSE GIVE ME A LOT OF IS KIND OF A CAT AND MOUSE GAME. FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY SENATE BILL FIFTY WERE TO PASS AND MANDATORY UP ZONING BOARD HAPPEN AROUND LOCAL DROUGHT TRANSIT STOPS YOU STILL SEE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BEEN A BURNING UP THE PERMITTING PROCESS TO TRY. TO YOU KNOW AND I CUT OUT YOU KNOW HOW GAME THAT -- THAT UP ZONING SO YOU KNOW TO CERTAIN EXTENT I THINK THAT DYNAMIC IS EVERY HEARD IT WITH THE RENO DISCUSSION THAT YOU HAD EARLIER WHERE YOU HAVE THIS BEING A PROCESS THAT THE LOCALS IN THE REGION'S REALLY KND OF CAME TO ALSO. TO TO AVOID HAVING A REALLY COMPLY SO I THINK HOW LOCALS ARE DOING IN TERMS OF COMPLIANCE AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A PROCESS TO ENFORCE -- AND ALSO FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION IS OFTEN NEEDED I DO THINK THE POINT THAT MISUSE MADE AROUND -- LINKING FUNDING IS REALLY CRITICAL TO TRY TO GET LOCALS -- TO TO REALLY STEP UP BUT IN I WOULD SAY YOU COULD LINK GAS TAX FUNDS OF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TO HOUSING PRODUCTION AS ONE METHOD AND SIMPLY HAVING MORE -- YOU GRANTS AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. YOU KNOW I WANT ONE COMMENT I HEARD ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AT HEIR OFTEN DESCRIBED AS A CHEAP DATE IF YOU DANGLE SOME GRANT MONEY FROM WILL COME ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW COMPETE EACH OTHER TO TRY TO GET THOSE FUNDS SO. THAT CERTAINLY IS ANOTHER OPTION TO TRY TO GET THAT GET SOME TRACTION BUT YOU KNOW IF THE A LOT OF THE MANDATES REQUIRE A LOT OF STAFF TIME FOR LOCALS THAN THERE ARE BITS CAN BE MUCH HARDER FOR THEM TO COMPLY SO I THINK SIMPLY REMOVING BARRIERS. REMOVING DISCRETION SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SEE WHAT PROCESS SEES ON NEW LOCAL PROCEDURES ARE DEDICATE A LOT OF STAFF TIME TO IT NOW THEY HAVE THE POLITICAL COVER TO TELL THEIR CONSTITUENTS I'M SORRY THE STATE'S DOING THIS TO US. I THINK THOSE TEND TO BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PASS FORWARD. AN I AM -- TH PROPOSING AN AMNESTY PROGRAM STATEWIDE SO THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS. COULD BECOME GET TEN YEARS TO GET LEGITIMATE BUT A THEY WOULD ALSO GET IMMEDIATE RE THEIR NECKS ON THE NEXT BATCH SO THAT THE THERE'S SOME CARE IT THERE -- I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT MORE HOURS LATER I GET. THANK YOU SO MUCH ON DUTY QUICKTIME CHECK WITH THE COMMITTEE WERE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE FOR AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WITH THE PLENTY TIME ALSO FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE MISS CABALLERO WHO WILL BE SPEAKING HERE. IT'S MORE LIKE A YOU COULD. WRITE THE TURNOVER CYNICAL BUREAU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I REALLY ENJOYED THIS -- THIS PANEL ME JUST JUST SAY THAT -- I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF INCENTIVES I NEVER CONSIDERED MYSELF WHEN I WAS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT A CHEAP DATE. WHATEVER IT TAKES -- BUT LET ME LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK IS IS THE TENSION THAT I FEEL IN TERMS OF THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT -- I'VE I'VE REPRESENTED SALINAS BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL AND NOW IT THAT BACK IN THE ASSEMBLY AND NOW WITH AT THE SENATE BUT I ALSO INCLUDE A LARGE PORTION OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND IT'S THE CENTRAL VALLEY PORTION IT'S ACCEPTING. A LOT OF THE REFUGEES FROM THE BAY AREA THAT ARE LOOKING FOR THESE BIGGER BIGGER HOMES AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT IN MY MIND AS WE LOOK. MOVING FORWARD TO THE KINDS OF POLICIES THAT CAN FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE HOW PEOPLE SEE HOUSING -- IS IS THIS IS A BET THE LACK OF A OF A RECOGNITION THAT AGRICULTURAL RANGELAND AND OPEN SPACE PARK LAND HAS. THE ABILITY TO SEQUESTERED. GREENHOUSE GASES AND THAT IT SHOULD KING ABOUT SO BEFORE WE GET TO A VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED KIND OF TAX ON HOW FAR ARE YOU COMMUTING WHICH HAS THE PERVERSE IMPACT ON THE POOR PEOPLE BECAUSE THOSE WEALTHY ENOUGH THEY CAN STAY IN THAT COMMUNITY. STAY IN THE LIVES THEY ACTUALLY WORK CLOSE TO THEIR JOBS THOSE THAT CAN AFFORD MOVE FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT AND IN SO THAT THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCENTIVIZE THE DEVELOPMENT I REALLY ENJOYED HEARING WHAT SAN DIEGO IS DOING. BECAUSE BECAUSE EUROPE YOU'RE A BIG COMMUNITY AND AND EAT AND YOU'RE PUSHING PEOPLE INTO SOME OF THE OTHER. POOR COMMUNITIES PROJECT THE ABILITY TO CHANGE IT FOR A BURKE A BROAD GROUP OF PEOPLE AND SO THE SO THE CHALLENGE IS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE SOME OF THE SMALLER UNITS. PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN THESE YOU KNOW TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR SPACE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH ANYBODY SO THE ABILITY TO MOVE INTO AN EIGHT HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT -- UNIT IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO I PART OF I GUESS PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT I SEE IS THAT -- FOR US TO INCENTIVIZE PURCHASING. A ELECTRIC VEHICLE. FOR SOMEONE WHO WOULD ALREADY BY IT IN IN A BUT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD INSTEAD OF INVESTING IN. TRANSIT TO THE SUBURBS AND TO RURAL CALIFORNIA MEANS THAT WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE CONNECTED IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT CONVENIENT FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BE GIVEN A VOUCHER. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO THEIR JOB SIXTY MILES AWAY SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE REORGANIZED -- THAT THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING BUSINESS IN A AND AND AS A SNAPSHOT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE BEEN IN PUBLIC OFFICE I HAD TO COMMUNITIES. IN MY DISTRICT AT TOWN HALL MEETINGS PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT -- A INITIATIVE TO STOP GROWTH AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GROW IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THEY THAT THERE'S THIS NECESSITY OR THEY WANT DON'T WANT OUT HOUSES. IT'S BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC HAS BECOME SO BAD AND WE WILL NEVER GET RESOURCES FOR THOSE THAT TRAFFIC CONGESTION BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE IT'S RURAL. AND SO I MEAN I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE TENSION IN TERMS OF THE INCENTIVES ASFAR AS I'M CONCERNED IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO GET LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO SAY YES WE WERE. IT AND ALL OF THOSE COUNCIL MEMBERS BY THE WAY ARE KIND OF APPALLED AT THIS GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT BUT UNTIL WE CAN SHOW THEM THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE TRAFFIC ISSUES ARE NOT GOING TO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUILD SO -- I DON'T THERE'S NOT A QUESTION THERE BUT I JUST THINK THAT AS WE START TALKING ABOUT. HOW DO WE REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES IT CAN'T JUST BE -- THAT THAT WERE BUYING ELECTRIC VEHICLES IT WE ALSO HAVE TO INCLUDE HOW DO WE INCLUDE THE SUBURBS AND AND THE AND THE RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH HIGHER. UP PLEASE REAL QUICK OH YEAH WELL I WOULD JUST SAY YOU'RE WITH AS I MENTIONED MY PRESENTATION LECTURE VEHICLES ALONE ARE GOING TO GET US THERE WE DEFINITELY NEED TO LOOK INTO THOSE. CARBON SEQUESTRATION BENEFITS AND JUST RAISE A LOT OF GREAT POINTS BUT JUST ON THAT THE MTV QUESTION IF THOSE DOLLARS ON A EVAN THERE'S A V. M. T. V. WHICH EVENTUALLY WE NEED TO MOVE TO WHERE TO FIND TRANSIT. BIBLE TRANSIT OPTIONS FOR THOSE PEOPLE LIVING IN OUR COMMUNITIES OUR EDGE COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT WOULD PROVIDE A REAL ECONOMIC AND QUALITY OF LIFE BENEFIT FOR THEM. TO GET TO WORK WITHOUT HAVING TO COMMUTE IN A SINGLE THANK YOU WITH YOU BUT WE BETTER BILL THE SYSTEM BEFORE WE START DOING VMT I'M JUST SAYING IF PEOPLE WERE MAD ABOUT A GAS TAX BEFORE. YOU START ADDING BE EMPTY ON TOP OF THAT IN MY DISTRICT THEY'RE THEY'RE TRAVELING AT LEAST SIXTY MILES INTO AND THAT TAKES A COUPLE OF HOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH HAPPIER. THE GENTLEMAN OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THANK YOU TO OUR PANEL GREAT DISCUSSION TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING TIME AND IF YOU TRAVEL FAR AND WIDE TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. RETURN IT BACK OVER TO THE CHAIRMAN I TO BE ABLE TO RUN OUR PUBLIC PORTION PART OF THE HEARING FUTURE. AND AGAIN THANK YOU TO ALL THE PANELISTS WILL NOW -- OPENING UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS IF FOLKS WOULD LINE UP ON THE LEFT IS A MICROPHONE -- STANDING THERE -- PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE TWO MINUTES AND IF YOU COULD -- WOULD IF YOU'RE WILLING TO STATE YOUR NAME AND IF YOU DO HAVE AN AFFILIATION THANK YOU. THE SECOND -- IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATORS FOR SO I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PUTTING THE SAP PROGRAM THESE PANELS TOGETHER THEY WERE. REALLY INFORMATIVE -- I CURRENTLY SERVE ON THE NEVADA CITY COUNCIL AND HAVE EVER SINCE JUNE OF NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND I ALSO AND PAST PRESIDENT OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND BUT A LOT OF TIME AND THEN AND SO IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN FOR A MUCH SO. I'M YOU KNOW OVER IT WHEN WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK I LEARNED ONE THING FROM OUR CITY MANAGER ONE IS THAT HOUSING DOESN'T PAY FOR ITSELF. THE STATE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT HOUSING PAYS FOR THE SERVICES. THAT CITIES PROVIDE. NEVADO IS A POOR PROPERTY TAX CITY WE GET FIVE CENTS ON EACH DOLLAR A PROPERTY TAX THAT'S PAID WHERE ES SAFE. CITY -- NOT FAR FROM WHERE WE LIVE IN SENATE'S HOW MORROW THEY GET TWENTY THREE CENTS. FOR THE DOLLAR BILL VALLEY GETS TWENTY SIX CENTS ON THE DOLLAR WE CAN'T PROVIDE ALL THE SERVICES BASED ON THE FIVE CENTS PER DOLLAR. THE STATE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING A SEVERITY FOR THOSE CITIES THAT WERE FORMED AFTER -- NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HAD A LOW MIL RATE WHEN ALL THE PROPERTY TAXES WERE FROZEN WHEN PROP THIRTEEN WAS PASSED. STATE NEEDS TO HELP YOU SOLVE THAT PROBLEM SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICES ONE THING WE HAVE AN ADVANTAGE WE HAD HAMILTON BASE CLOSURE. SO WE WERE ABLE TO WITH REDEVELOPMENT WE USED A 100%. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN WE USE A REDEVELOPMENT. TO BUILD HOUSING ON HAMILTON AND SIX HUNDRED AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO SET ASIDE A FUND. SO THAT EACH YEAR MONEY GOES INTO HER GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR THOSE OVER THREE THOUSAND HOMES. AND WE JUST APPROVED THIS LAST TWO YEARS FOR MORE DEVELOPMENTS IN HAMILTON FOR HOUSING. I'M THE OTHER THING THAT WE COULD DEFINITELY USE IS VACANT HOMES WE HAVE A LOT OF VACANT HOMES AND IN OUR COMMUNITY WHY DOESN'T THE STATE SAVE A VACANT HOME AS STAYS VACANT FOR MORE THAN THREE TO FIVE YEARS. WHY DON'T YOU PER HABIT OR SAY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR PROP? THIRTEEN OUT PROPERTY TAX LIMIT THAT IS A STATE LAW THAT COULD VERY WELL HELP ENCOURAGE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO KEEP THOSE HOME VACANT FOR TEN YEARS OR LONGER. TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO BRING IT BACK INTO PRODUCTION --% ALSO TO I REALLY FIRMLY BELIEVE AND I AT THAT LARGE BUSINESSES. NEED TO PROVIDE AND BUILD HOUSING FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES WHERE THEIR JOBS ARE. WE NEED THE CITIES YOU KNOW WE DON'T BUILD THE HOUSING -- WE AND THE SMALL FINDS THAT WE DO YOU GET WE HELP THE NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS LIKE EDH AND HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND HOMEWARD BOUND I MEAN. SIR MAGUIRE'S BEEN TO HAMILTON IS SEEN WHAT NEVADA HAS DONE WHAT WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BUILT MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT ALL THE OTHER TEN CITIES IN THE COUNTY. SO PLEASE I AGREED WITH THE SENATOR HAVE A RARE -- THAT WE NEED INCENTIVES AND NOT FIT ALL PLEASE GIVE US SOME TOOLS. AND WE WILL DEFINITELY PRODUCE THE HOUSING THAT WE NEED. THANK YOU A SECOND. HELLO SAYS A MATINEE HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA U. M. B. I'M HERE JUST TO READ IT REITERATE THEIR POSITION -- THAT THEY BELIEVE THE STATE REALLY SHOULD COME IN. AND REDUCE SOME OF THE LOCAL ZONING RESTRICTIONS -- TO ALLOW. MORE HOUSING TO BE BUILT -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND I'M REALLY DO ENCOURAGE -- INCENTIVE BASED -- INCENTIVE BASED LIKE. A AND SENATE BASED POLICIES HE'S ME LIKE RINA -- AND AN INCREASE HOUSING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THANK YOU. HI SUSAN CURSE FROM LIVABLE CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE PANEL IT'S REALLY BEEN HELPFUL AND INFORMATIVE. SO A COUPLE OF RESPONSES TO THE THINGS THAT HAVE COME UP ONE IS THERE'S BEEN THE REFERENCE TO THE CAT AND MOUSE GAME OR THE TENSIONS THAT EXIST BETWEEN CITIES AND LEGISLATORS. I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT YOU HAD ONE PERSON WHO WAS A VERY STRONG PANELISTS THIS IS CAROLINE COLEMAN FROM THE GIVE CALIFORNIA CITIES. OTHERWISE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WAS A REAL ABSENCE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE REPRESENTING CITY COUNCILS THE WAY PAT ACKLAND JUST SPOKE ON BEHALF OF WHAT. HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN HER COMMUNITY AND KNOWING THE NUMBER OF ARTICLES THAT ARE COMING OUT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING ABOUT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING TRIED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THAT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE ALL VERY WELL AWARE WHAT'S HAPPENING LOCALLY WITHOUT COMBINED EFFORT BETWEEN ELECTED OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. JUST ANOTHER THING I MEAN THE POINT BUT THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT THAT THERE IS PROBLEMS BUT HOUSING AND ESPECIALLY WITH OF AFFORDABILITY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALSO WAS NOT TALKED ABOUT TODAY IS HOW. ONE OF THE DEFINITIONS OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE FACING IN ADDITION TO IT BEING A HOUSING CRISIS IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN AMAZING SUCCESS BLOOM IN SILICON VALLEY. AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT I'M HOLDING UP HERE BUT THIS WOULD BE A PICTURE OF THE KIND OF HOUSING THAT WOULD BE SURROUNDING. THE APPLE CAMPUS IF PROVIDING THE KIND OF HOUSING THAT THEIR JOBS GROWTH HAS INITIATED AND WE'VE GOT THESE KIND OF IMAGES FOR FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE AND OTHERS ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THOSE COMPANIES THAT HAD. BROWSING SUCCESSES WITH WITH WHAT THEY'VE DONE. AND HOW TALENTED BIG BUSINESS IS IN OFF LOADING VOSE EXPENSES IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR PROFIT MARGINS SO HI. IN I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS THE A GRAND JURY REPORT THAT CAME OUT OF THE SANTA CLARA CIVIL GRAND JURY THAT WAS LOOKING AT WHAT SILICON VALLEY COULD DO IF THEY WERE COMMITTED TO SOLVING. THE PROBLEM THAT THEY HAVE HAD THE BIGGEST AND IN CREATING SAYING THAT. DEMI THIS SOUNDS LIKE A HUGE NUMBER BUT WITH TWENTY OR THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY WERE IDENTIFYING IS AVAILABLE. COMING OUT OF SILICON VALLEY IF THERE WERE A FAIRER WAY OF ASSESSING THEM THEY COULD SOLVE FOR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM AND THE BUILDING PROBLEM. FOR TWENTY BILLION FOR THIRTY BILLION TWENTY BILLION THEY SAY IF THEY MOVED TO TO GILROY WHICH WE DON'T KNOW IF KALRA WOULD LIKE THAT. THE I HAVE A GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THERE IS TOO OFTEN A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE HARD WORK THAT'S GOING ON AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND THE KIND OF TOP DOWN WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING WE'VE GOT TO FIX THIS. SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO REALLY KEEP THE DOOR OPEN TO WORKING IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY WITH THOSE MORE VOICES LIKE TO LEAVE A CALIFORNIA CITIES TO SEE HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. TO HANDLE THIS IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE AND HAS A LONG TERM SOLUTION AND SUPPORT FOR WHAT WE DO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHECK SPEAKER. GOOD AFTERNOON MR MEMBERS BRIAN WHITE HERE WE HAVE TO THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING ALLIANCE. WHERE COALITION OF LOVE MARKET DEVELOPERS SINGLE FAMILY MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPERS?
