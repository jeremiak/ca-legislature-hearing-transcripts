AGAIN ANOTHER THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE DONE WELCOME EVERYONE AND MEMBERS TO THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE FOR OVERSIGHT HEARING. OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM. LAST YEAR THIS SUB COMMITTEE HELD THREE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON EDT. WHICH WAS GREATLY IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN BY THE PANDEMIC. I KNOW THAT ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE RECEIVED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF REQUEST CALLS AND EMAILS. ON THIS MATTER MY OFFICE IS NO DIFFERENT AND WE HAVE DONE THE BEST WE CAN TO ASSIST. CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE ARE STRUGGLING. DURING THESE UNPRECEDENTED TUMULTUOUS TIMES. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS HAS HEARD FROM DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS. OR THOUSANDS OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH EDT. A STORY MANY MY CALL MAY ABLE TO IS THAT OF A CONCERT WHO REACHED OUT TO MY OFFICE BECAUSE THEY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. IN REACHING EIGHTY TO GET HELP WITH THEIR PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE CLAIM. NO ONE ANSWERED IN Q. TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE- BEFORE THEY WERE JUST HUNG UP ON AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF WORKING WITH MY OFFICE THEY WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE NEARLY NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN BENEFITS. THE PET THE PANIC DESPERATION AND COMPLETE LACK OF TRUST TOWARDS THE PROCESS WAS QUITE EVIDENT. JUST EARLIER THIS MONTH A CONSTITUENT THAT HAD HER HUSBAND'S CLEAN FROZEN CONTACTED MY OFFICE FOR ASSISTANCE. THEY LIVE ANIMAL TELL BECAUSE THEY LOST THEIR APARTMENT LAST YEAR. AND HER HUSBAND SUFFERS FROM A HEART CONDITION. SHE EXPRESSED TO MY STAFF THAT SHE HAD. SUICIDAL THOUGHTS BECAUSE OF THESE DIFFICULT. I'M SURE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. THAT HAD THIS KIND OF THIS TYPE OF CALL. I BRING THIS UP I BRING UP THE STORIES BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN LIFE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THEIR END OF THEIR ROPE IN OUR FRAYED AND NOT GETTING ANY HELP THAT THEY NEED RIGHT NOW. THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CLAIM INSANITY HAS FRUSTRATED OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND LEAVES MANY NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO NEXT. OFF THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT WAS AT ITS PEAK AT 16% IN APRIL AND MAY OF LAST YEAR. THAT'S ROUGHLY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT A JOB. WITHOUT MEANS WORRIED WONDERING AND FRIGHTENED ABOUT THE FUTURE. TO DATE EDT HAS RECEIVED MORE THAN THIRTEEN POINT SIX MILLION. APPLICATIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. LAST YEAR WE SAW THE CLAIMS BACKLOG REACH ONE POINT SIX MILLION. THIS COMMITTEE WAS TOLD THAT THE BACKLOG WOULD BE CLEARED BY TOMORROW THE LATEST REPORTING SO THAT THE BACKLOG HAS NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND NINETEEN CLAIMS. ITIS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT THE PROGRESS HAS BEEN. OR TODAY'S HEARING WE HAVE ONE PANEL TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING EDIE'S BACKLOG PROGRESS ON THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS. PROGRESS ON ROLLING OUT NEW FEDERAL FUNDS FRAUD AND FROZEN DEBIT DEBIT CARDS. AND LANGUAGE ACCESS CHALLENGES. THE HEARING WILL FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING THE ISSUES THAT EDT HAS IN ORDER TO HAS MADE IN ORDER TO FIND-SOLUTIONS. EDT HAS MANY SIGNIFICANT MISSTEPS SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN AND THE LEGISLATURE IS IN THE BUSINESS OF HOLDING ALL DEPARTMENTS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND EIGHTY D. WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THAT SAID IT IS ALSO THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT ET IS AN AGENCY THAT HAS FACED UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES. GIVEN THEIR MASSIVE CHANGE AND WORKLOAD. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE THE WORKERS EDT. THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE ALSO HAD TO ADJUST FROM WORKING FROM HOME THINGS SAFE AMID A PANDEMIC. AND PERHAPS ARE ALSO DEALING WITH THE REALITIES OF DISTANCE LEARNING FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AND GENERAL BROADBAND LIMITATIONS. THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE ENTIRE STATE. IN CASE YOU HAVE A HEARD IT TODAY OR IN THE LONG TIME. WE THANK YOU. WITH THE ASSEMBLY. AND EIGHTY D. HAVE A SURE GOAL PROVIDE BENEFITS TO UNEMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS QUICKLY SO THAT WE CAN LIVE SO THEY CAN LIVE THEIR LIVES WITH DIGNITY TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR LOVED ONES WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT EDT HAS ALL THE RESOURCES. TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO MEET THAT GOAL. THIS MORNING THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR RELEASED AN AUDIT ON ED'S HANDLING OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM DURING THE CALL THAT NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE WILL HOLD A HEARING ON THAT ALREADY WHICH IS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE RELEASE OF THE AUDIT INCLUDED. THE BEST SOLUTION TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEMS WE SEE SPLASHED ACROSS HEADLINES IS RETURNED TO A STRONG HEALTHY ECONOMY BUT WE ARE NOT THERE YET IN THE MEANTIME WE MUST STOP THE RAMPANT FRAUD THAT IS COSTING OUR STATE COFFERS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING OUR STATE. UNEMPLOYMENT SERVICES. MY OFFICE LIKE MANY OF THE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE TODAY. I HAVE HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHOSE ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN FROZEN FOR LIVING IN MOTELS AND DESPERATELY IN NEED OF HELP THEY DON'T NEED THIRTY DAYS TO WAIT THEY DON'T HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO WAIT. IN AND THEY DESERVE BETTER. MYSELF AS WELL AS WELL AS THE MEMBERS HERE AND ACROSS OUR LEGISLATIVE BODY HAVE RECEIVED CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR EDT ON IN SHORT. UNINSURED FOR EDT- PROTHESIS MONTHS AGO HAVE YET RECEIVE THEIR FIRST PAYMENT AND THEREFORE ASK US TO HAVE ASSISTED FEED THEIR FAMILIES OVER THE HOLIDAYS. THEY HAVE BEEN HURT BY A SYSTEM IN NEED OF MATH TO REFER. OUR TO PRIORITY HALF BE THE CLAIMS BACKLOG AND THE REACTION THE REACTIVATION OF THE FROZEN ACCOUNTS. ALL PROPOSED REFORMS MUST ANSWER THE QUESTION. DOES THIS HELP THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE MOST HELP RIGHT NOW.BANK OF AMERICA HAS THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY OF OPENING ACCOUNTS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE APPROVED CLAIMS AND PROVIDE PROVIDING THEM WITH DEBIT CARDS. THE AVAIL TO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ALERT PLEINEMENT. AND POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH THEIR DEBIT CARDS OR ACCOUNTS IN REAL TIME. B. OF A NEEDS TO OFFER EDT. ACCOUNT AND DEBIT CARD HOLDERS THE SECURITY. IT OFFERS ITS CUSTOMERS AS WELL. I HOPE TODAY'S TODAY MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A PARTNERSHIP TO FIND SOLUTIONS. I DON'T EXPECT THE WORK TO BE EASY I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND TODAY'S GUESTS ON UNDERSTANDING THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND OUR OPTIONS AND MOVING FORWARD WITH A SOLUTION. WE PLAN TO HAVE A QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION AFTER THE PANEL HAD CONCLUDED WITH THEIR PRESENTATIONS. I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS MOMENT TO OFFER ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. A CHANCE TO PROVIDE. ANY OPENING REMARKS MEMBERS I. ATHEY TRY TO KEEP HER CALM AND CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. HELLO WE HAVE TIME FOR MEMBER QUESTIONS AND PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END. AND UNLIKE. MISTER SOUTH.

OUR THE PANDEMIC STRUCK EDT AS IT DID ALL THE OTHER EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE OF PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND YEAH SIMPLY WE WERE NOT PREPARED. WE'RE NOT PREPARED FOR THE GLOBAL CRISIS IN THE EXTORT CRISIS AND EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH WAS TESTED. IN THE EXISTING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM AS YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE AN AGENT R. I. T. SYSTEM WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO MODERNIZE IT. BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS ON TOP OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY STRING AND THE DEMAND FOR PEOPLE WHO WORRY NEEDS ARE WIDESPREAD FRAUD. ORGANIZATIONS OUR CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES SUCH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS CREATED FOR THOSE HIT HARDEST BY THE RECESSION. THESE SOPHISTICATED FRAUD SCHEMES TARGETED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AGENCIES ACROSS THE NATION. HOLDEN ON THE SUSCEPTIBILITY.

THE SECOND SPEAKER IS- CHAS ALAMO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON. CHADEMA WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. CAN YOU HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU PLEASE CONTINUE FIVE MINUTES FOR OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU ON OUR OFFICE PRODUCED A HAND OUT- AT THE REQUEST OF STAFF FOR THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING IT'S AVAILABLE ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE AS WELL AS AT OUR OFFICES WEBSITE- HOPE TO SPUR BUT A QUICK OVERVIEW ON RECENT WORKLOAD- SOME DYNAMICS WITH THE EDT BACKLOG AND TALK A BIT ABOUT STEPS RECENTLY TAKEN TO ADDRESS POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS- SO FIRST REGARDING WORKLOAD. AT THE NUMBER OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED EACH WEEK HAS DECLINED FROM THE PEAK LEVELS SEEN IN THE SPRING- BUT DESPITE THIS SLOWDOWN- CURRENT WORKLOAD REMAINS ABOUT FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN TYPICAL AT SORT OF NON ECONOMIC RECESSION PERIODS SO. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE DEPARTMENT GETS ABOUT FIVE FIFTY THOUSAND YOU AYE CLAIMS PER WEEK OUR MINUTES CURRENTLY RECEIVING AROUND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PER WEEK SO THIS GOES TO SHOW JUST AS AN EXAMPLE THAT WORKLOAD REMAINS RELATIVELY. ELEVATED EDT- OUR HEAD OUT A BRIEF TIME- OF THE MAJOR EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED AT E. D. I SENSE A PANDEMIC BEGAN AND I WILL GO THROUGH THEM IN DETAIL BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT TO CRITICAL STEPS IN OUR VIEW- THAT TOOK PLACE IN SEPTEMBER I THINK HELP. INFORM THE CONVERSATION HERE FOR TODAY AND THE FIRST WAS THE INSTITUTION OF- TWO MAJOR STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HE BE THE pWHERE EXPERIENCED STAFF TO TURN TO WORKING DOWN BACKLOGGED CLAIMS DURING THE RESET THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT ACCEPT AND PROCESS NEW CLAIMS ON AND DURING THE RESET THE DEPARTMENT ALSO INSTITUTED A NEW IDENTITY VERIFICATION SOFTWARE TOOL CALLED ID ME. THAT WE'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT. ON ALSO IN SEPTEMBER INDEPENDENT OF THE STRIKING RECOMMENDATIONS EDT BEGAN TO NOTICE WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SUSPICIOUS JUMP IN ACTIVITY FOR INCOMING CLAIMS FOR THE FEDERAL P. YOU A PROGRAM THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM LARGELY FOR SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS. AND AT THE TIME THEY FLAG YES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND AT. REQUESTED IN FACT THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IN WASHINGTON TO GET APPROVAL TO STOP AUTOMATICALLY APPROVING BACKDATED P. WAY CLAIMS SO CLAIMS WERE COMING IN IN SEPTEMBER. AND THEY WERE- CLAIMING UP WEEKS OF P. WAY BENEFITS INCLUDING THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR WEEKLY OUT ON GOING BACK EIGHT NINE TEN TWELVE WEEKS ON END AT THE TIME CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS OTHER STATES WERE AUTOMATICALLY APPROVING THESE BACKDATED CLAIMS THAT WERE INCOMING. EDT FELT THAT THIS POTENTIALLY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REQUESTED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR TO NO LONGER AUTOMATICALLY BACK DATE THE FIRST TOUCH BASE AND VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF THAT CLIMATE BEFORE AUTOMATICALLY BACKDATING. DEPARTMENT LATER APPROVED EDT STEP AND IN FACT THE NEXT WEEK ENCOURAGE OTHER STATES TO SET UP A SIMILAR INSTANCES WHERE WE COULD POTENTIALLY SLOW SOME OF THESE POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS INCOMING I'M AND I POINT THIS OUT TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT CREDIT FOR NOTICING THIS TREND OF FIRST IN THE AND IN THE U. S. AS STATUS. AS FAR AS WE KNOW AND SETTING UP STEPS TO LIMIT THAT ACTIVITY ON THEIR BREAK UP IS TWO POINT SINCE SEPTEMBER BECAUSE THE FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY THAT WE'LL DISCUSS LATER LARGELY IN LARGE PART HAS TO DO WITH CLAIMS THAT WERE PROCESSED PRIOR TO THIS PERIOD WHEN IT ME WAS SET UP AND WHEN ON DVD STOPPED AUTOMATICALLY BACKDATING. AUTOMATIC CLAIMS. I'M TURNING TO THE BACKLOG IN SEPTEMBER THE STRIKE TEAM IDENTIFIED ONE POINT SIX MILLION CLAIMS THAT WERE IN THE THAT YOU AYE BACKLOG MEANING THEY WERE MORE THAN THREE WEEKS DELAYED ARM AND IT OVER THE FALL THERE WAS SOME INITIAL SUCCESS ON BEHALF THE DEPARTMENT AND IN ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG THAT THE BACKLOG FELL TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CLAIMS IN MID NOVEMBER BUT IN RECENT MONTHS THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THE BACKLOG HAS BEGUN TO INCH UPWARD AGAIN I THINK AS AS WAS MENTIONED AND- THE CHAIRS INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS- THE BACKLOG IS NOW IDENTIFIED IT ALMOST ONE MILLION CLAIMS AT NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND CLAIMS. AS OF THIS WEEK EVD HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT MANY OF THE CLAIMS IN THE U. I. BACKLOG ARE SIMPLY CLAIMS FOR WHICH EDT IS AWAITING A RESPONSE FROM THE CLAIMANT- OBVIOUSLY WHAT WILL WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT EASY STEPS TO COMMUNICATE WITH CLAIMANTS. BUT IT COULD BE THE CASE THAT EITHER THESE CLAIMS WERE ABANDONED OR THEY WERE POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT AND SO RESPONSE HASN'T COME. TURNING TO FRAUDULENT CLAIM ACTIVITY- OBVIOUSLY. A LOT OF INFORMATION HAS COME TO LIGHT IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS- BUT SORT OF TAKING A STEP BACK FROM FROM BOTH THE AUDIT SECRETARY SUSE COMMENTS YESTERDAY ABOUT FRAUD A COUPLE THINGS WE WANTED TO POINT OUT TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF FRAUDULENT CLAIMS ACTIVITY. ON AT PDT RIGHT NOW HAVE TO DO WITH THIS NEW PROGRAM FOR SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS P. WAY. OUT AND WE POINT THIS OUT BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM IS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL LAW AND FEDERAL GUIDANCE THAT AS WE UNDERSTAND THE STATE FOLLOWED. FRAUDULENT CLAIMS IN THIS IN THIS PROGRAM ARE NOT CONTAINED CALIFORNIA THEY'RE AFFECTING YOU I PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND ADDITIONALLY THAT THIS PROGRAM IS 1100% FEDERALLY FUNDED I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE LIGHT OF FRAUDULENT CLAIMS- BUT RATHER THAT THESE. THE POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY CONCENTRATED IN THE STATE'S YOU I TRUST FUND- BUT RATHER AT THAT THE FEDERAL TRUST FUND. I'M AN. FINALLY TURNING TO SERVE A COUPLE POINTS WE WANTED TO MAKE ABOUT RECENT STEPS AT EDT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CLAIMS I'M AT THE END OF LAST YEAR EDT REVIEWED ABOUT TEN MILLION OF THESE P. UA CLAIMS THAT IDENTIFIED ONE POINT FOUR MILLION OF THEM. AS POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT. ON THE POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS WERE SUSPENDED BY EDT AT THAT TIME. ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US YET WHAT INFORMATION OR CRITERIA THE DEPARTMENT USED TO IDENTIFY THE CLAIMS I'M NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT THE SUSPENDED CLAIMS WERE SENT OUT IN EARLY JANUARY. AS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE HE DID NOT NOTIFY CLAIMANTS BUT FOR THEIR CLAIMS WERE SUSPENDED. THE CLAIMS THAT WERE FLAGGED AS POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT ARE SUSPENDED UNTIL THE CLAIMANT'S IDENTITY CAN BE VERIFIED SO WE UNDERSTAND THE MAJORITY THESE CLAIMS SORT OF PREDATE THAT SEPTEMBER PERIOD. SO THESE CLAIMS ARE FLOWING BACK THROUGH THE IDEA ME PROCESS- IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF THE CLAIMANTS. AT THIS POINT WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. WE BELIEVE IT'S TOO SOON TO KNOW HOW MANY LEGITIMATE CLAIMS WERE SUSPENDED AT THE END OF DECEMBER BOB FOR BEING POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT WE KNOW THAT SOME WORKERS HAVE COME FORWARD WITH COMPLAINTS THEIR ACCOUNTS WERE SUSPENDED- BUT IN THE COMING WEEKS WE SHOULD HAVE A BETTER PICTURE. OF WHAT SHARE OF. THE POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS THAT WERE SUSPENDED BY EDT- IN FACT BELONG TO LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. AND THE REASON WE BRING THIS UP IS. IS BECAUSE IT IT RAISES IN OUR VIEW SOME CONCERN ABOUT EDIE'S SELF ASSESSMENT IN ADDRESSING- THE IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT RELATED TO FRAUD SPECIFICALLY- R. I WILL QUOTE ONE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT THAT ET HAS. LISTED AS COMPLETED ON THEIR ONLINE TRACKER- THE RECOMMENDATION IS THAT QUOTE EDT CULTURE MUST SHIP FROM REACTIVITY. TO RATIONALITY AS IT RELATES TO FRAUD AND QUOTE AND TO DO SO. COMPLETING THIS RECOMMENDATION QUOTE. FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION PRACTICES MUST BE SUPPORTED BY DATA AND EVIDENCE AND THAT JUSTIFICATION FOR NEW AND EXISTING ANTI FRAUD PRACTICES. INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS NOT ONLY OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS BUT ALSO TRADE OFFS AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PRACTICES INCLUDING ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL CLAIMANTS. DURING THIS POINT UP BECAUSE IT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT IF EDT WENT THROUGH THE FULL PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF ITS STEPS. TO ADDRESS FRAUD AT THE END OF DECEMBER AND THOSE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON ON POTENTIALLY LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS- IT MAY BE THE CASE EIGHTY ONE CORRECT DOESN'T SENSE OF PROGRESS. BUT AT THIS POINT OUR OFFICE HAS NOT BEEN MADE AWARE OF IT- AND WE WANTED TO RAISE THIS ISSUE FOR THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS SOME QUESTIONS- TO THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THEIR PROCESS. IN DETERMINING- THE STOCKS THEY WOULD TAKE THE LATITUDE TO THESE POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS AT THE END OF OUR HAND OUT WHICH I ACT AGAIN IF YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU INCLUDES. NOT ONLY THAT QUESTION BUT SEVERAL OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK THE COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER- AS IT AS IT HERE'S MORE FROM. DEPARTMENT AND FROM BANK OF AMERICA THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER ALAMO THERE WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL. A GIVEN THAT WE HAD SOME DIFFICULTIES WITH TECHNOLOGY EARLY ON I DO WANT TO GIVE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO AN OPPORTUNITY TO. GIVE REMARKS JUST IN THE EVENT THAT WE WILL DO SOME AGAIN DUE TO SOME TECH PROBLEMS. SO IF WE CAN GO TO MR CHIU PLACE.

GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE AND- LET ME JUST START BY BY THANKING EVERYONE FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND DOC I PARTICULARLY WANT TO WELCOME THE NEW EDT DIRECTOR TO HER FIRST BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING- AND THANK HER FOR TAKING ON ONE OF THE JOBS IN GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA- I THINK MANY OF US ARE WE'RE ALL COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR NEW LEADERSHIP TO FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND REALLY APPRECIATE- THE CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE ALSO FOR HER- HER VERY QUICK IMMEDIATE ENGAGEMENT- I THINK THE MOMENT SHE BECAME CHAIR ON ON HELPING ALL OF US- THINK OF HOW WE WILL WORK TOGETHER TO TACKLE THIS. OF MEDICARE IF IT'S OKAY I'D LOVE TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS TO THE EDT AFTER I KNOW I THINK WE'RE ALL ANXIOUS TO HEAR FROM BANK OF AMERICA BUT WOULD LOVE TO JUST- THEY WERE JUST A COUPLE OF A FRAMING QUESTIONS AND WONDERING IF THAT IS. IN ORDER AT THIS POINT. OTHER MEMBERS HAD QUESTIONS AS WELL WE'RE DOING AT THE END OF THE PANEL SO WE WILL CONTINUE OKAY BANK OF AMERICA AND THEN AT THE END WILL DO THE ENTIRE PANEL FOR QUESTIONS.

DURING OUR DISCUSSION WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO SUPPORT EDT FOR LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. AND TO ADDRESS THE LEVEL OF CRIMINAL FRAUD PROGRAM IS EXPERIENCING. BANKAMERICA STUDENTS FROM AUTUMN I'M SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT CAN WE HAVE YOU TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT LOUDER INTO YOUR MICROPHONE PLACE. SURE IT'S BETTER THANK YOU. OKAY BANK AMERICA HAS BEEN THE PREPAID DEBIT CARD PROVIDER FOR THE STATE OF BUT A PROGRAM FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH EDT TO DELIVER MUCH NEEDED BENEFITS TO QUALIFY CALIFORNIANS. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE HAD TO ENGAGE THE DIRECTOR SIGNS IN HER BRIEF TIME IN OFFICE AND WITH OUR TEAM OVER THE PAST YEAR TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE PROGRAM WE LOOK FORWARD TO A LONG. AND CONSTRUCTIVE PARTNERSHIP. THE OTHER THE EDT WE SHARE. THE SAME OBJECTIVES. ENSURING THAT BALLOT CLAIMANTS RECEIVE TIMELY SUPPORT. AND TO MINIMIZING AND MITIGATING THE LEVEL OF CRIMINAL FRAUD WE ARE SEEING PROTECT THE PROGRAM. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANT POINTS. THE CRIMINAL FRAUD IN THIS PROGRAM IS NOT UNIQUE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR SEVERAL OTHER STATES. AND FRAUD IS CHALLENGING UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS EVERYWHERE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE SIZE AND SCALE THE pSUBSTANTIAL FRAUD. INCLUDING CRIMINALS WERE FRAUDULENTLY ATTEMPTING TO CLAIM BENEFITS. IT IS OUR ASSESSMENT THAT THERE IS SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL NETWORK ACTIVITY INVOLVED IN THIS HAS BEEN ASSESSED BY ALL OF THE THIRD PARTY SPECIALISTS AS WELL. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH EDT TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES. PENTAGRAMMIC BEGAN WE'VE ISSUED MORE THAN NINE MILLION DEBIT CARDS. INVOLVING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED BILLION IN BENEFITS THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. ON BEHALF OF THE EDT. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES ASIDE TO SUPPORT EDT AND CLIMATES. THIS INCLUDES NEW PROCESSES FOR EXPEDITING HANDLING FOR CLAIMANTS AND SEARING INFORMATION ET ABOUT FRAUD STRATEGY. THE TRUCK ONCE IT'S BEEN FREEZING CARDS BROTHER CONCERNS LISTED CARDHOLDER WAS NOT ENTITLED TO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AT ALL. I KNOW WE WILL DISCUSS THAT MORE DETAILS. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF FROZEN ACCOUNTS REPRESENT FRAUD. BUT WERE STOPPED REPRESENTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OR MORE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. I HAVE A REGULAR ENGAGED WITH EDT TO INCREASE ACCOUNTS WHERE WE CAN'T. YOU'RE WORKING HARD IN OUR DISCUSSING WAYS TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THAT PROCESS. BANK AMERICANS TAKE A NUMBER OF STEPS ON ITS OWN. WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE FRAUD UNDER VARIOUS FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND STATUTES AND REPORT SUSPECTED CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. THE BANK HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN DOING SO. THROUGHOUT OUR FOCUS AFFECT AMERICANS NOT SERVING BUDGET EMIT UNEMPLOYED AT FISHERIES. AND MINIMIZING THE IMPACT OF CRIMINAL FRAUD ON A SIGNIFICANT SCALE SCALE. I KNOW WE SHOULD FOCUS WITH EDT AND WITH ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU TO BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER AHMAD WE ACTUALLY HAVE ONE MORE SPEAKER. AND BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH NUMBER QUESTIONS FOR THE ENTIRE PANEL THE LAST BIGGER IS SENT TO SERENA SANTANA LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE CHINESE FOR CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. IS MISS ANNA. IS INDIVIDUAL ON THE LINE. THIRRING SANTANA ON THE LINE. ONE MOMENT. SHE'S IN THE REMOTE. SHE NEEDS TO UN MUTE SHE'S IN THE HEARING ROOM. WE GET HER. WONDERFUL TECHNOLOGY.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CENTER CERAM SANTANA WHICH CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION I WANTED TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEYOND A PART OF THIS PANEL. CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS A CIVIL RIGHTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THAT WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. AND LANGUAGE ACCESS IS ONE OF OUR CORE- ISSUES THAT WE WORK ON BOTH THE PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICES AND IN ADVOCACY. WE ARE CURRENTLY. CAN I GO ON OR IS THERE YES SORRY ABOUT THAT PLEASE GO ON OKAY OKAY SURE OF. A CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH A COALITION OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN LOS ANGELES THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA ON BARRIERS CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYED WORKERS ARE FACING WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED TO ACCESS THEIR EDT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WITH LITTLE TO LIMITED. OR NO PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH. IN THESE DISTINCT REGIONS OF THE STATE. WE SEE CALIFORNIA WORKERS EXPERIENCING SIMILAR CHALLENGES. LANGUAGE BARRIERS AN OVER RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN SERVICES AND A LACK OF PLAYING A LACK OF CLEAN OR LACK OF INFORMATION IN PLAIN LANGUAGE AT THE EDT THAT COMBINE TO CREATE A TSUNAMI OF EXCLUSION FOR CALIFORNIANS FROM MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS RESIDENTS. THESE THREE FACTORS COMBINED WITH LOW LITERACY RATES ALSO HAVE LED TO EXPLOITATION OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS WHOSE DOMINANT LANGUAGES ARE NOT ENGLISH OR SPANISH. THERE HAS BEEN MUCH EMPHASIS AS WE'VE SEEN- ON FRAUD AND FRAUD PREVENTION. THESE HEARING IN THESE PUBLIC HEARINGS WITH EDT. LANGUAGE ACCESS IS FRAUD PREVENTION AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES LET ME JUST SAY THAT AGAIN LANGUAGE ACCESS IS FRAUD PREVENTION IN OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHEN EDT IS INACCESSIBLE TO APPLICANTS WHO HAVE LIMITED TO NO PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH. THESE THIS PAVES A PATH FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM WE HAVE SEEN THIS HAPPEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL IS LOCKED OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND THEY ARE APPROACHED BY SOMEONE WHO PASSES HIMSELF OFF AS AN EXPERT FOR AN EXORBITANT FEE THEY WILL SUBMIT THE CLAIM FOR THEM TAKE A PERCENTAGE OF WHATEVER COMES. AND THEY END UP THESE INDIVIDUALS AND UP KEEPING THE APPLICANT'S PASSWORD AND PERSONAL INFORMATION. WHEN THESE UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS SUBMIT A CLAIM THAT HAS AN ERROR IT IS THE WORKER THE FACES THE HEART CONSEQUENT HARSH CONSEQUENCES- THEY WITHOUT LANGUAGE ACCESS AT EDT THEY CAN'T CLEAR UP THIS MISTAKE IF THEY CAN'T REPORT IT THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN IT AND- IT JUST PROVIDES A HOST OF CHALLENGES FOR. OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WELL THERE IS A HUGE BACKLOG AT THE EDT. MANY OF MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS CANNOT EVEN SAID THAT A CLAIM BECAUSE OF THE POOR ACCESS FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS AT EDT. THIS IS EXACERBATED BY COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE LOW LEVELS OF LITERACY AND SMALLER LINGUISTIC GROUPS. THE FASTEST WAY TO APPLY FOR EDT BENEFITS IS ON THEIR ONLINE PORTAL. ON THEIR WEBSITE. HOWEVER THE ONLY PORTAL IS ONLY IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH THERE ARE OVER TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND SPANISH RESIDING IN THE STATE. COMMUNITY MEMBERS- CAN ALSO APPLY ON THE TELEPHONE HOWEVER THE PHONE LINES HAS BEEN IMPENETRABLE AS REALLY LINGUISTICALLY INACCESSIBLE. IF AN INDIVIDUAL IT DOES CALL AND THEY GET A LIVE OPERATOR THE LANGUAGES PROVIDED ARE IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. AT INDIVIDUALS- CAN ALSO APPLY FOR BENEFITS ON PAPER HOWEVER THE APPLICATION IS ONLY IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. THE SUBCOMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTE SOMETIME IF I COULD JUST ASK FOR YOU TO WRAP YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE- THERE ARE MANY SO I WILL SUBMIT MY WRITTEN. COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO POINT OUT THE GOOGLE TRANSLATE DOES NOT WORK- THE ANALYSIS NOTES THAT EDT PROVIDES A HUNDRED IN EIGHT LANGUAGES IN GOOGLE TRANSLATE. AND GOOGLE TRANSLATE IS- IT DOES NOT PROVIDE IT IS A LITERAL WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION THERE'S NO CONTEXT AND IN TRANSLATION CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING- IN AND OUT COMPLICATED APPLICATION PROCESS THAT'S HIGH STAKES. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT A MACHINE TRANSLATION NOT BE USED SO THE BY ITSELF BUT HAVE HUMAN REVIEW- I WILL SUBMIT THE REST OF OUR WE HAVE A WHOLE SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I DIDN'T GET TO AND WE WILL SUBMIT THIS TO YOUR STAFF TO UP UP FOR TO BE ON THE PUBLIC RECORD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND WE APPRECIATE THE INSIGHT ON THE LACK OF. CULTURAL LINGUISTIC. ACCESS TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THAT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP. FOR Q. AND A WITH THE MEMBERS AND I HAVE MISTER SALAS THE FIRST FOLLOWED BY MISS PETRI NORRIS THAN. A MISCUE. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND I THINK THE FIRST ONE IS FOR- MISS SIGNS OVER AT EDT. YOU KNOW I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET SOME CLARITY ABOUT THE FLUCTUATING YOU YOU Y. CLAIM NUMBERS- THAT EDT RECENTLY REPORTED. FOR INSTANCE WHEN I LOOKED AT THE WEBSITE ON JANUARY NINTH EDIE'S WEBSITE SAID THERE WAS A HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT. ADDITIONAL CLAIMS AWAITING PAYMENTS. BUT THEN THE VERY NEXT DAY THAT NUMBERS TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND. AND FORTY FOUR THEN TEN DAYS AFTER THAT IT REACHED. NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE. SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY THAT BACKLOG. OF CLAIMS HAS GROWN SO MUCH IN JUST A COUPLE OF. WITHIN TWO WEEKS. AND WHY THAT'S THE CASE AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. EXCELLENT QUESTION. I WANT TO HAVE THIS DOUBLE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE A GENERAL EXPLANATION AND THEN- ONE OF MY CREEK DEPUTIES WILL PROVIDE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION SO YES CURRENT AS OF JANUARY TWENTIETH THE CURRENT BACKLOG SHOWS ACCOUNT OF ROUGHLY NINE THOUSAND NINE MILLION. AND MY EX ME. IT FEELS NINE MILLION NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND UNIQUE CLAIMANTS SO WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT NUMBER. THE CURRENT INITIAL CLAIMS DASHBOARD CONTAINS A CATEGORY CALLED WAITING FOR CLAIMANTS CERTIFICATION. WHICH REPRESENTS ACTIONS REQUIRED BY THE CLAIMANT. IN ORDER FOR EDG TO CONTINUE. THE CLAIM IT NEEDS TO SPLIT APART TO SUBMIT THEIR FIRST BI WEEKLY CERTIFICATION FOR. WE DETERMINED AND EVERY TWO WEEKS AFTER SO IN THE FIRST PLACE WE NEED A BETTER DASHBOARD THAT'S OBVIOUS. CAROL IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY ABOUT THAT. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH BECAUSE THE- THE PART THAT WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO EXPLAIN. IS ARE THE CATEGORIES ON THE STRIKE TEAM DASHBOARD IN OUR EVOLUTION INTO A SMARTER- MORE FREIGHT DASHBOARD IN THE COMING WEEKS 91% OF THE NINE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND. I CLAIMS PEOPLE ON THAT THE PASSPORT WE ARE LITTLE. WAITING FOR THEM TO CERTIFY THERE'S A NUMBER OF EFFORTS THAT WE'VE BEEN UNDERTAKING IN THAT SENSE THE FALL TO ENSURE EVERY CLAIM IT KNOWS THE PROCESS YES IT'S OVERLY COMPLICATED WE CERTAINLY NEED TO SIMPLIFY IT BUT THEY HAVE TO CERTIFY INITIALLY AND COME BACK EVERY TWO WEEKS. AND IT'S THE RETURN OF EVERY TWO WEEKS THAT UP. WE'RE TRYING TO GET IN THERE ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE GAP. SO CLOSE- FIND EMPLOYMENT IN THE ABANDONED THEIR CLAIM AND THOSE. THANK WILL STAY ON THE DASHBOARD FOR THIRTY DAYS- FOLKS ARE UNAWARE THAT THEY HAVE TO RETURN AND WE ARE NOW% MAKE NOT NOW WE STARTED THIS IN THE FALL AS YOU KNOW MAKING OUTBOUND CALLS EVERY SINGLE DAY THE CLAIMANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO RETURN IT'S NOT OKAY FOR THEM TO JUST SIT FOR THOSE. CLAIMS TO SIT ON THE DASHBOARD WERE ACTIVELY AND PROACTIVELY TRYING TO ENSURE THAT IF THEY'RE THERE IT'S BECAUSE THE INCLUDING ABANDONED THEM BUT THE INCREASE IN THIS CATEGORY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS- M. THERE WASN'T. ERROR SO LET ME JUST BE REAL BRIEF AND TELL YOU ABOUT THAT IT'S A VERY SMALL PART. BUT IN THIS MASSIVE AND COMPLICATED PROGRAMMING OF BRINGING UP THE NEW. PROGRAMS THE NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS- AND I'LL JUST SAY BEFORE MANY MANY OTHER STATES. MADE OF STICKS WITH. WE MADE TO I'M SURE SOMEONE WILL BE INTERESTED IN THE RE OPENING ITS YOU'RE- VERY HAPPY. ONE IT. WAS WHEN WE GRABBED ALL OF THE CLAIMANTS AND WE SAID WE ARE GOING TO OPEN YOUR CLAIMS WE'RE GOING TO POPULATE THE WEEKS FOR. THE NEW PROGRAMS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CERTIFIED. WHEN WE GRAB THAT POPULATION QUITE HONESTLY WE GRAB A SUBSET THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DISQUALIFIED THEY WERE OLDER PLANES. THESE BOTH WOMEN AND THEY TRY TO CERTAINLY OPEN THEIR CLAIMS AND THEY'RE NOW SITTING ON THE DASHBOARD THEY CONTINUE TO BE DISQUALIFIED. FOR ELIGIBILITY REASONS. BUT OUR PROGRAMMING IS NOW FOCUSED ON. COMPLETING THE REST OF THE NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS SO THEY'LL SIT THERE FOR THIRTY DAYS AND SO WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE DISTORTION WE ARE WORKING TO CREATE A BETTER AND SMARTER DASHBOARD SO I'LL STOP THERE IN ESSENCE OF TIME AND ALLOW FOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YEAH LET ME JUST. JUST CONTINUE ON THAT BEFORE I ASK MY NEXT QUESTION. A RECALL IN PAST HEARINGS YOU SAID ONCE WE- IMPLEMENTED THE ID ME SYSTEM WE WERE GOING TO AVOID A LOT OF THIS. SO DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT'S WORKING IF IS NOT THE STILL GOING THROUGH THE SAME ISSUE OF CERTIFICATION HE JUST ELABORATE WHY THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY. I DE MI WAS BROUGHT ON BECAUSE OF THE- IT WAS DETERMINED BY THE STRIKE TEAM THAT YOU WERE HAVING TO MANUALLY PROCESS. LOOKS LIKE WE NEED A TO YOUR CALL WE HAD A BABY WAS BROUGHT ON IN ADDITION WITH ADDITIONAL EDT EFFORT TO INCREASE THAT 290% AUTOMATION AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. SO I DIDN'T CAME ON TO. AUTOMATE THE PROCESS AUTOMATE THE INITIAL CLAIM FILING PROCESS IT ALSO PROVIDES A MEASURE OF. FRAUD DETERRENT OR FRAUD DETECTION. SO THAT'S IDEA. THAT WAS THE- SPEED. THE CERTIFICATION AS ALWAYS AND CONTINUES TO PAY HER REQUIREMENTS. ACTION THAT THE CLAIMANT HAS TO TAKE. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT ME M. EDT BEARS RESPONSIBILITY ENSURING THE EDUCATION IS ABSOLUTELY THERE BUT THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY COME BACK AND SAY I HAVE FOUND WORKING DIDN'T FIND WORK- OR WAGES IF WAGES. IF THEY RECEIVED EARNINGS THEY HAVE TO DO THAT- I CERTAINLY MEANT LOOKING FORWARD TO US SIMPLER WAY FOR THEM TO DO THAT WELL IT'S ACTUALLY SIMPLE BUT THEY JUST NEED TO DO IT SO WE CAN'T MAKE THE DETERMINATION TO EARLY THEY'VE ABANDONED THE CLEANING SO WE. LAST THIRTY DAYS. SO I HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE AND IF I COULD JUST I COULD JUST TAKE A GROUP STEP BACK THE- BACKLOG THAT WE ALL DISCUSSED FROM DISTRACTING WHICH WAS ONE POINT SIX MILLION. BACK LOG IS JUST ABOUT DONE. HERE SORTED AND ATTESTED THAT WE WILL BE DONE THIS MONTH AND- AS OF LAST FRIDAY THERE WERE LITERALLY A HUNDRED AND TEN CLAIMS LEFT AND THESE ARE NOT NORMAL PROCESSING CLAIMS THAT. A CLAIM FILED IT THERE. HOW REQUIRES TECHNICAL RESOURCES FROM I. T. STAFF BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO RESOLVING THOSE CLAIMS THE BOUNTY THAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW HAS BECAUSE YOU SAW THE DECREASE HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS. US MAKING THE WEEKS AVAILABLE CLAIMANT'S NAME COMMENTED CERTIFY IF THEY'RE ELIGIBLE THAT'S THERE TO TURN THEIRINITIAL DECISION AND THEN WILL WE DO A MEASURE CHECKING FOR NORMAL YOU Y. SO DOES THAT I HOPE ANYWAY THAT FROM. THE HELP ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU YEAH NO THANK YOU I THINK IT DOES BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE SAYING INITIALLY THAT WAS ONE POINT SIX. BILLION THE ONE HUNDRED SIX POINT MILLION. BACKLOG THAT WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE STRIKE FORCE BUT NOW. YOU'VE YOU'VE WORKED ON THAT BUT NOW. THE BACKLOG IS NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND. BUT THAT'S BECAUSE OF ALL THESE OTHER NEW CRITERIA IS WITH THE NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS- THE ERROR THE DVD HAD. BUT YOU KNOW IN YOU MENTIONED IN THAT ERROR YOU GRABBED OLDER. INELIGIBLE CLAIMANTS DO YOU KNOW WHAT PRIVILEGE OF THE 91% OF THE- NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND. THAT PERTAINS TO ARE WE LOOKING AT MOSTLY NEW CLAIMANTS OR IS THAT JUST PEOPLE THAT GOT. LOOKING UP SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION WE'RE ABSOLUTELY LOOKING THE BOOK OF IT OUR NEW CLAIMANTS THERE'S ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT WE GRABBED INADVERTENTLY. SO IF I COULD ALSO- THE TO. THE PASSPORT THE AND READERS IT WILL TELL YOU THE PUBLIC THE CLAIMANTS. BACK RELATED TO BILLING THE ACTION AN ACTION THAT WE'RE WAITING FOR THE NEXT SO IT'S NOT ALL CONVOLUTED A MIXED TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT REALLY IS- THE PICTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE PRESENTED WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTIONS WERE ALSO USING A DEAL WELL INSTRUCTING MEASURE THAT OUR GOAL IS TO NOT CARRY. ANY BACKLOG BUT THE FEDERAL MEASURE REALLY IS NO MORE THAN TRANSITION TO PROVIDING UP- TRANSPARENT OR PERFORMANCE MEASURES I HOPE THAT HELPS GOT IT NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE DIRECTOR IN OUR OPENING COMMENTS TALKING ABOUT MODERNIZING EDT AND I HOPE. IN OUR MODERNIZATION WEEKEND BY CIPHERS THIS INFORMATION ON THE DASHBOARD A LOT MORE CLEARLY AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK JUST BY DOING THAT YOU'RE GONNA IMPLEMENT SOME REFORMS IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY- FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AS WELL SO APPRECIATE THAT- I DO HAVE A SECOND QUESTION MADAM CHAIR IF THAT'S OKAY- SECOND QUESTION REALLY IS- WHEN I STARTED MY OPENING COMMENTS ABOUT AND THAT'S REALLY FOR. BANK OF AMERICA AND FOR EDIE D. AND IT'S ON THE SUSPENSION OF THE BANK CARDS BECAUSE LAWS LIKE YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS- THERE'S LOTS OF CALIFORNIANS OF CONTACTED EACH OF OUR OFFICES ABOUT. THE SUSPENDED ACCOUNTS AND I KNOW WE BRIEFLY TOUCHED UPON THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO ASKA VERY BASIC QUESTION IS. NOT WHY WERE THOSE ACCOUNTS- FROZEN IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WHO WHO CALLED THAT CHART WAS IT EDT THAT. TOLD BANK OF AMERICA TO FREEZE OUT OR DID BANK OF AMERICA. FREEZE THAT ON ITS OWN. AN ARAB IF MAY ADD TO THAT. NOT ONLY BE ABLE MADE THE DECISION BUT WITH A CRY TO BAHAI IT AB. AT THE FOLLOW. WHAT CAN SO OF THIS IS A DIRECT. IN DROUGHT. THE DECISION WAS MADE BETWEEN BANK OF AMERICA AND EDT. I HAVE A NOTE ABOUT THIS. SO IN SEPTEMBER THE BOOKS THAT ARE A GROUP OF SUSPICIOUS KHARGE IDENTIFYING THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND POTENTIAL FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. IN THE INTERIM. EDT EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT WAS REVIEWING OPTIONS TO BEST ADDRESS BEST ADDRESS THESE ACCOUNTS IT WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE BANK THAT THE CARDS COULD BE FROZEN. SINCE THAT TIME EDT HAS WORKED TO IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN ORDER TO FREE UP THEIR BENEFITS. WHAT'S WE VALIDATE THEIR IT FIRM THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS S. R. FRAUD CULTURES WE BEGIN TO AB THE BENEFITS BY CHECK. THE BANK USING LAWS REGULATIONS AND RULES THAT ARE APPLICABLES TO BANKS. AS CONTINUE TO FREEZE ACCOUNTS BASED ON THEIR OWN OBLIGATIONS AND PROTECT YOUR- WE'RE WORKING TO CONTINUE. WITH CONTINUALLY WORKING THE BANK OF AMERICA TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS SUBJECT REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHTFUL BENEFITS CAROL IS THERE ANYTHING AT DATA THAT. I CAN ACT FINANCING DIRECTOR NANCY VARIOUS- WITH EDT- THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY- V. THE I BELIEVE- JUST OUT ON TO WHAT THE DIRECTORS THE WITH THE ONE POINT FOUR. MILLION STOP PAYS THAT WAS PUT ON I BELIEVE THAT'S- POSSIBLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN IN DECEMBER- THAT WAS MADE BY- EDT EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP INCLUDING MYSELF TO PUT A STOP PAY- ON THOSE CARDS- WE RAN ALL OF OUR- AS I THINK YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW WE RAN ALL OF OUR CLAIMS THROUGH. OUR THOMSON REUTERS- FRAUD FILTER AND IT YOU KNOW IT CAME BACK WITH YOU KNOW OVER THREE MILLION CARDS OF WHICH MOST WE HAD ALREADY DISQUALIFIED THE ONES THAT WERE NOT DISQUALIFIED- WE PUT A STOP PAY ON THOSE BACK AT THE END OF DECEMBER- WE DID NOT NOTIFY EVERYONE AS AS- THE L. A. O. POINTED OUT. ON THAT DAY WE DID NOTIFY THEM BY THE END OF THE YEAR THAT THERE WAS A STOP PAY ON THEIR CARD- WE THEN DID. SEND OUT THE LINK- YOU KNOW STAGGERED FOR ID ME SO THEY COULD GO THROUGH ID VERIFICATION FOR ABOUT ONE MILLION OF THEM THEY WERE NOT ALL ID RELATED SOME OF THEM WERE NON IDENTITY- FRAUD FILTERS THAT WORKS. FROM THOMSON REUTERS- SO AND I HOPE ANSWERS THE OTHER PART OF THAT QUESTION. WELL THE **** IS ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION I KNOW- THE MADAM CHAIR. SOME FOR SHE WAS ASKING ABOUT THE CLARIFICATIONS ON THE LIKE WHAT QUALIFICATIONS DID USE AS A BASICALLY YOU RAN A FRAUD FILTER AND IF THEY GOT FLAGGED AND THAT'S HOW THEY- YOU AUTOMATICALLY SAID THIS. ACCOUNT IS SUSPENDED OR WAS IT THROUGH THE ID ME. IT WAS THERE ARE FRAUGHT FIVE FILTER IT WITH NOT ID NEEDS SO IT WAS THROUGH THOMSON REUTERS ARE FRAUD FILTER- AND THERE ARE YOU KNOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT CRITERIA THAT THAT YOU KNOW I'M I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE WE WOULDN'T. TALK ABOUT HERE RIGHT NOW BUT- AND THAT WAS THE DECISION THAT WAS WHY WE MADE THAT DECISION BECAUSE THEY WERE FLAGGED AS- FRAUDULENT. GOT IT AND SO IT JUST THAT JUST BEGS THE QUESTION WHAT. ID YOU READ THE FRAUD FILTERS WHEN YOU FIRST GAVE OUT- WHEN HE FIRST STARTED DISBURSING FUNDS BECAUSE WE KEEP READING THESE HEADLINES OF. HOW MUCH PRIDE AND HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH MONEY IS PROBABLY POTENTIALLY BEEN LOST TO FRAUD. AND WAS JUSTICE DONE LATER WHEN WE STARTED. TO WORKING WITH BANK OF AMERICA OR WHY IT WASN'T DONE AT BOTH CASES AND JUST SOME GOT MISSED. I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE- WHERE THE GAP IS. YEP THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO EDT AS FRAUD FILTERS YOU KNOW WE WORK WE HAVE YOU KNOW CYBER SECURITY- FILTERS THAT WE USE WE HAD. YOU KNOW PRE PANDEMIC. SO LET MONEY MAYBE BACK UP PRE PANDEMIC ON THE U. I. SYSTEM WAS NOT NECESSARILY- YOU KNOW THERE WAS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF FRAUD IN THE U. I. SYSTEM. THE KEY WAY THE FEDERAL AS AS THE L. A. O. POINTED OUT YOU KNOW WITH THE P. AWAY THEIR LAST CHECKS AND BALANCE. LET'S CHECKS ON- BEFORE. I PAYMENT IS- DISTRIBUTED SO WE HAD FRAUD FILTERS THAT WORKED UNDER UNDER YOU WHY- UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT WE GOT. SINCE THE PANDEMIC AND THE TYPE OF INTERNATIONAL- CRIME THAT THAT AS BANK OF AMERICA POINTED OUT- INTERNATIONAL CRIME ORGANIZATIONS. I'M THOSE FILTERS WERE NOT. GOOD ENOUGH QUITE FRANKLY- WHAT ARE THE AMOUNT OF CLAIMS THAT WE HAD. SO AFTER THE STRIKE TEAM- CAME AND YOU KNOW RECOMMENDED ID ME YOU KNOW WE ALSO THEY ALSO RECOMMENDED AND ARE NOT NOT NECESSARILY TALK TO WRITERS BUT- YOU KNOW WE START LOOKING AT- WHAT KIND OF A TOOL THAT WE CAN USE TO. ENHANCE OUR FRAUD- FILTERS SO ORIGINALLY WHEN WE- OBTAIN. THOMPSON REUTERS. WE WERE RUNNING OUR CLAIM THROUGH THE REUTERS AND THEN WE WOULD PUT A STOP PAY LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN DECEMBER. NOW WE ARE RUNNING OUR CLAIMS THREE OF THOMSON REUTERS BEFORE PEOPLE ARE PAID- SO THAT SHOULD ALLEVIATE HOPEFULLY ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR- MASS- STOP PAYS LIKE WE DID- AT THE END OF DECEMBER THERE IS ONE MORE MONTH THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON SAID TO GO THROUGH THOSE CLAIMS BUT- WE ARE GOING TO RUNNING. ALL OF OUR CLAIMS THROUGH THOMSON REUTERS BEFORE- PEOPLE GET PAID ESSENTIALLY YOU KNOW STOPPING FRAUD AT THE FRONT DOOR. RECLAIMED WHEN THIS FIRST BEGAN HE DIDN'T RUN EVERY CLAIM THROUGH THOMSON REUTERS. I THINK THAT WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING AND WAS THAT A FUNCTION OF WHAT WAS THAT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF A DVD WASN'T HE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH- ALLOCATION FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE THIS OVERSIGHT OF JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THAT SO WE CAN FIX IT MOVING FORWARD. SO WE ACTUALLY HAD- YOU KNOW AS A AS I JUST SAID WE ACTUALLY HAD A LOT OF FRAUD FILTERS- PRETE PANDEMIC. THAT WORKED FOR THE STRAIGHT UP YOU AYE SYSTEM RIGHT FOR STRAIGHT UP UNEMPLOYMENT- AND THAT WAS YOU KNOW AGAIN I I'M NOT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN OUR FLAG RATE WAS BUT IT WAS VERY LOW- IT WAS. IF I CAN REMEMBER IT WAS BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. SO WE THEY DID WORK. YOU KNOW- PRE PANDEMIC. ET YOU KNOW SO POST PANDEMIC WHEN IT WAS THE WAY AND THERE ARE LESS CHECKS COMING FROM YOU KNOW BASICALLY JUST PER THE CARE ACT THEY WERE JUST LACK LESS- CHECKS YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO ID VERIFICATION NO CERTIFICATION. YOU KNOW THEN. YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED SEEING ALL THE FRAUD BACK IN- OVER THE SUMMER AND WE REALIZED THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG THAT AUTOMATIC BACKDATING WE STOP THE AUTOMATIC BACKDATING BEFORE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY DID BECAUSE WE SAW. THE YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING BACK THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT SPIKE THAN WE HAD ASSUMED THAT IT WAS BROAD AND THAT'S WHEN WE BROUGHT IN- THOMSON REUTERS. TO HELP US WITH THAT AND THEN WE RAN OUR CLAIMS THROUGH AND THEN HENCE THAT THE V. DECEMBER- STOPPING ME IN THE MINUTE. YES OKAY REALLY BRIEFLY BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WOULD HELP WHAT IS THE TIMELINE. SO UP UP UNTIL OCTOBER FIRST EDT HAD DONE ITS OWN IDENTITY VERIFICATION. AS YOU KNOW OCTOBER FIRST- I D. ME K. IN. ON A FORWARD MEASURE. MMHM FOR ALL CLAIMS FILED BEGINNING. TEN ONE FOUR. THEN WE BECAME EXPLORING ANOTHER LAYERED APPROACH FOR FRAUD WE ENGAGED WITH THOMSON REUTERS. THE FIRST TIME WE USED IT IN BULK WAS THIS ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMS THAT WE SUSPENDED AND LATE DECEMBER. THAT WHILE YOU WAS THE LOOK BACK PRIOR TO OCTOBER FIRST FOR IDENTITY VERIFICATION SO I'M SORRY THIS IS CONFUSING BUT- THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I DO WE- WITH THE FORWARD APPROACH FOR NEW CLAIMS WE NEED TO GET PLANTS EVERYTHING GOING BACK TO I BELIEVE IT WAS JANUARY AND THAT'S WHERE THOMSONREUTERS CAME IN AND GAVE US ANOTHER LAYERED APPROACH ANOTHER LOOK FOR EVERYTHING THAT WAS BEHIND US IN TERMS OF RAW SO CAROL WOULD YOU SAY. WHEN WE STARTED USING THOMSON REUTERS. I'M I THINK IT WAS A SMALL SAMPLE PERHAPS I'M JUST LOOKING AT HOW THEY WOULD USE DATA AND UNDERSTANDING THEIR METRICS IN NOVEMBER BUT THE FIRST MAJOR APPLICATION WAS IN DECEMBER SO WE DIDN'T HAVE THOMSON REUTERS BEFORE THAT NO NOT REALLY NOT KNOW. RIGHT SO AND ALSO REALLY BRIEFLY- WE FELT THE PAIN OF THE INNOCENT CLAIMANTS. AND THAT ONE POINT FOUR IT WAS A DELIBERATE DECISION WE FINALLY HAVE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ANALYSIS ON SUSPECTED FRAUD IN OUR IN OUR INVENTORY. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY ON THE EVE OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS BEING EXTENDED AND IF WE DIDN'T TAKE ACTION MORE OF THE SAME VICTIMIZATION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE. WE HEARD. IN ONE STEP EVERYONE KNOWS YOUR IDENTITY HAS BEEN STOLEN IT ISN'T IT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO UNRAVEL THAT PERSONALLY SO IF I COULD JUST SAY WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING TO PUT GREATER INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE FOR THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THAT HAS OCCURRED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I JUST I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE ONE THING ON THE- THE P. WAVE VERSUS THE U. Y. YOU KNOW. WHAT IF THE IF YOU HEARD ARE THAT YOU KNOW THE OUR PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY YOU KNOW I MEAN. 95% OF THIS- FRIDAYS IN THE P. WAY PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW IT'S ABOUT 5% OBVIOUSLY IN IN YOU WHY AND THAT WAS AS I UNDERSTAND. TWENTY NINETEEN THE- FRAUD RATE AND EASY D. WAS ABOUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX PERCENT- AND SO IT IS CONSISTENT YOU KNOW THAT THE TOOLS THAT WE USED FOR OUR PRE PANDEMIC- WORK. YOU KNOW- AND THEY JUST DID NOT WORK FOR THE P. WAY PROGRAM. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW WE'LL GET INTO PROBABLY SOME MORE THOSE QUESTIONS NEXT WEEK. BUT JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON THE CARD- ON THE CARDS THAT WERE FROZEN BY BANK OF AMERICA. HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT AND FREEZING THE ACCOUNTS AND NOTIFYING PEOPLE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE WAITING FOR RELIEF THOUGHT THEY HAD IT. AND THEN HAVE SOME CHECKS BOUNCED BECAUSE THEN THEY WERE FROZEN EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE LEGITIMATE CLAIMS. I BECAUSE I KNOW THOSE WERE SOME OF. THE FOLKS THAT WE HEARD FROM IN OUR OFFICES. SO THAT'D BE THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION- WITH THE STOP KATE AREN'T NECESSARILY FROZEN CARDS- WE PUT A STOP PAY ON AND THERE THERE ARE LIKELY SOME THAT BANK OF AMERICA HAS. FROZEN THE CARDS BUT AS- CAROL MENTIONED. WE ARE GOING THROUGH THOSE THEY ARE MOST MOST OF THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ARE GOING TO I. NI. AND ONCE THEY- CLEAR IDENTITY. YOU KNOW IT COMES BACK TO EDT AND THEN. IF THEY YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IF THEY CLEAR ID ME AND THERE ARE NO AND THEY HAVE CERTIFIED CONTINUE TO CERTIFY WHICH WE HAVE ASKED. CLAIMANTS TO DO AS AS IS REQUIRED THEN THEY WILL- BE PAID- AND IF IT'S NOT IF THEY IF THERE IS A FROZEN CARD. THEN THEY WON'T BE PAID BY CHECK. GOT IT IS THE TIME FOR THAT TO OCCUR WOULD BE WHAT A WEEK TWO WEEKS A MONTH. IT'S ABOUT I MEAN ONCE THEY GO THROUGH ID ME I WOULD SAY IT'S ABOUT A WEEK OR SO I THINK IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING THERE IS THERE HAS BEEN- ABOUTTHREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. THAT HAVE ALREADY CLEARED ID ME AND PAYMENT HAS EITHER BEEN MADE OR IS BEING MADE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK MATHIS SALAS THE QUESTION WAS ALSO DIRECTED TO BANK OF AMERICA AND I WANT TO PRE FAITH BY SAYING THAT BANK OF AMERICA HAS ENJOYED. AN EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE PAST DECADE THEY ARE A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT HAS BENEFITED AND PROFITED FROM THIS CONTRACT FOR QUITE SOME TIME- I WANT TO ALSO HEAR FROM BANK OF AMERICA IN TERMS OF. WHAT ARE THEY DOING WHAT DECISION WAS MADE THAT WE KNOW NOW THAT IT'S A DECISION THAT WAS MADE BETWEEN EDT. AND BANK OF AMERICA SO HOW WAS THE DECISION MADE AND HOW WAS HOWEVER ANY CHECKS AND BALANCES DONE ON ON YOUR SIDE. IT'S A IT'S PRESIDENTE THROUGH THE BANK. FIRST OF ALL- I WOULD SAY WE CONTINUE TO SHARE WITH THE EDT. THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS RECEIVE THEIR FUNDS THAT THAT IS THE CRITICAL ASPECT BUT WE WORK ON WITH THEM- AND ENSURING THAT IF THEIR ALLEGED REQUIREMENTS WITH THE POOL OF FROZEN CARTS AT THE SELECTION OF CLAIMANTS RECEIVE THEIR FUNDS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. OTHER THAN THAT THE- DIRECTOR SIDES OR STAFF. COVERED I THINK QUITE THOROUGHLY. OF THE PROCESS THAT WE JOINTLY UNDERTOOK THAT LED TO THE FROZEN CARD POPULATION. IN EARLY OCTOBER- AND- I'D BE A WE CONTINUE TO WORK AT UNFREEZING WHICH IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT BUT POOL UP BEYOND THAT. REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO. I THINK THAT LAST COMMENTED AND LOOK JUST A LITTLE BIT DISTURBING AND SAYING YOU HAVE NOTHING TO ADD WHEN THERE'S- MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING EACH AND EVERY DAY. I JUST WANT TO BEING CONSCIENTIOUS. THAT WE HAVE TO RESPOND TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IN GREAT NEED. AND THE ROLE OF THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING IS TO HEAR FROM YOU DIRECTLY. IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ENSURE THAT. PEOPLE THAT ARE RECEIVING THE DEBIT CARDS. ARE BEING NOTIFIED ON TIME AND THAT THEY ARE TREATED EQUALLY AT THE REST OF BANK OF AMERICA CUSTOMERS. OKAY YES HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT SO- WE'VE ADDED THOUSANDS. AGENCE OR VARIOUS CALL CENTERS TO ENSURE THAT CLAIMANTS RECEIVE THE SAME TREATMENT AS ANY OTHER BANK AMERICA CUSTOMER. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE EIGHTY D. AUDIT PROVING ANY PROCESSES. AROUND THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AT T. R. REFINING. ANY ASPECTS OF THE VARIOUS FILTERS THAT ARE USED AT LEAD TO FROZEN CARDS. FOR TO UNFREEZE CARDS- WE DO PART OF THE DEAL WE DEPEND ON THE EDT FOR THE AUTHENTICATION OF WHO ALLEGEDLY CLIMATE IS. AND ONCE THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED WE USE THAT TO UNFREEZE CARDS. OUT WHERE WE CAN. I WOULD ALSO ADD. THAT IN ADDITION TO ADDING- THOUSANDS OF AGENTS AND STAFF ACROSS ALL ASPECTS OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAM. BUT WE ARE MONITORING THE CLINIC EXPERIENCE. WHENEVER WE CAN HOW WE CAN WE OUGHT TO OUR OWN CALL CENTERS WE OUGHT TO QUIT IT'S EXPERIENCE AND WE ARE DELIVERED ENSURING. THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND IT EXPLODED MATTER. WHATEVER WHEREVER POSSIBLE. BUT BY ANY OTHER COLLEGE STATS BUT IT'S THE SECRET. I'M INTENDED TO HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO I DO THANK YOU FOR BOTH THE JUST ON THIS TOPIC FOR BOTH THE DMB AVE- SO MISTER AHMAD- THAT THAT ABSOLUTELY HAS NOT BEEN MY EXPERIENCE WITH MY CONSTITUENTS I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S REFLECTS. IF YOU TRY YES THE MARKETS ON. HI SORRY CAN YOU HEAR ME MISTER MARK. I CAN HEAR YOU OKAY THANK YOU ABU. I'LL TRY I'LL TRY TO SPEAK UP SO THE EXPERIENCE DOT WOULD YOU SAID APTLY DOES NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR SHAPE REFLECT THE EXPERIENCE SHOULD BY THE CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE CALLED MY OFFICE I DON'T KNOW IF IT REFLECTS WITH. MY OTHER COLLEAGUES IN THEIR CONSTITUENTS ARE FELT ON WE GET CALLS BECAUSE WE HAVE CONSTITUENTS WHO CALLED YOUR CALL CENTERS BEEN ON HOLD FOR HOURS WILL ACTUALLY GET TO SPEAK TO SOMEBODY THEY SAID THAT THE THEY REACH A BANK OF AMERICA CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE. THE THING THAT THE SECOND THAT COULD DO. THE SPEECH CONSTITUENTS HAVE GARDEN- ALREADY A CLEARANCE FROM EDIE D. N. SAID THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS THE SAID THAT THERE'S NOTHING AGAIN NOTHING THAT YOU CAN NOTHING THAT WE CAN DO- I FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW MY STAFF IS TO GET REIMBURSED BY YOUR BANK BECAUSE OF ALL THE TIME THAT WE'RE SPENDING. WORKING ON THESE CLAIMS ON THE BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT PAID TO DO YOUR JOB- BUT YET IT ENDS UP- COMPLETE FINGERPOINTING IN FACT WHEN I SENT A LETTER TO YOUR BANK ALL I GOT WAS A BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE POINTING FINGERS DD DDD POINT FINGERS. TO YOU THIS THE FIRST TIME. SINCE THE NEW. WHEN I WOULD- MEETINGS IN. DISCUSSIONS WERE BOTH ORGANISE THAT YOU ARE BOTH. IN THE SAME ROOM. WE GET PAID TO SOLVE PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS NOT TO POINT FINGERS. SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN HEARING THESE THINGS FOR MONTHS ON GOING BACK TO E. D. THE ONE WEEK PROCESS OF RESOLVING THESE CLAIMS I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT'S FOR MAYBE I'VE MISSED HER THAT BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY THE HERE IS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING THIS ROOM. BUT PLEASE CLARIFY BECAUSE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY. HAS NOT BEEN OUR EXPERIENCE UNLESS PERHAPS THE CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT ARE GETTING TREATED. DIFFERENTLY JUST LIKE THE GETTING TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM BFSI MISTER ABOUT IF YOU COULD PLEASE ANSWER. YES SIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEN FIRST OF ALL AGAIN. IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC CASES. OR SPECIFIC INSTANCES WITH RESPECT YOUR CONSTITUENTS. YEAH PLEASE DO REFERENCE- TO PROVIDE THE NAMES TO UP- FRIED POPULAR WHO'S ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO IS ONLINE RIGHT NOW- WE WOULD OF COURSE LOOK INTO THOSE CASES AND DRIVE AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY THE COR. UP IF A CUSTOMER. SECONDLY WE HAVE WE HAVE PROVIDED THAT INFORMATION TO YOUR BANK RIGHT. WHAT WOULD WE WILL WE WILL WE WILL TAKE IT AWAY. OKAY WELL THAT'S NOTED AND WE WILL TAKE A LOOK. THE WAIT TIMES THAT OUR CALL CENTERS ARE ONE MINUTE. WITH D. TAIL BEING BETWEEN ONE AND FIVE MINUTES THAT'S UP FOR NOT I DON'T KNOW FOR FOOD MAYBE YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT LINE FOR PEOPLE BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW WE GET TOLD THAT PEOPLE ARE ON ON YOU KNOW- IF IT WAS JUST ONE PERSON I WOULD SAY THAT ON PERHAPS THEY ARE INTELLIGENT BUT THIS IS VERY CONSISTENT AROUND THE FEEDBACK WE ARE GETTING FROM A NUMBER OF PHONE CALLS TO APPEAR ON HOLD FOR HOURS. I DON'T I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE STILL GETTING SENT TO A DIFFERENT. CALL CENTER A DIFFERENT PHONE NUMBER- I WOULD ASSUME THAT THAT IS. YOU KNOW A FEW MINUTE WAIT TIME IS A TYPICAL WAIT TIME FOR A BANK CALL CENTER. CLEAR CLEARLY THEY'RE NOT BEING SENT TO. ON THE SAME CALL CENTER YOUR REFERENCING OR EITHER THAT OR YOUR KNOW THE CORRECT. YES SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGAIN WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THOSE CASES IN GREATER DETAIL- THERE IS THERE ARE DEDICATED CALL CENTERS FOR THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. WITH DEDICATED STAFFING SO WE WERE ABLE TO TRACK THE DATA- QUITE CLOSELY BUT WE- WE WOULD OF COURSE- LOOK AT ANY CASES YOU HAVE. AN EXAMPLE IN DETAIL. THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER TANK- BECAUSE JUST ABOUT THE EIGHTY DIESEL. IS EXCUSE GIVEN THAT MEASURE. SO I WAS JUST GONNA I WAS GONNA ADDED THAT THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WHO ARE GOING TO WANT MISTER AHMAD'S EMAIL AND SEND HIM. ALL THE THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS THAT I HAVE YET TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR TO YOUR POINT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DISCUSS TO EATING DE. R. IS IT REAL ONLY. A WEEK OR DID I HEAR THAT INCORRECTLY TO RESOLVE THESE CASES. IT'S SIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER NATIVE AREAS WITH EDT- THAT THAT WAS SPECIFIC TO THE- THAT THAT I THINK IDENTITY THE I. DENSIFICATION ISSUES THAT WE HAD THAT WE PUT THE SPOT ON THE ONE POINT FOUR IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT ONE MILLION OR SO THAT HAD TO GO THROUGH ID MEONCE PEOPLE GO THROUGH ID ME. AND IF THEY ARE IF THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO CERTIFY THEN IT SHOULD TAKE ABOUT A WEEK I IT'S SOMEBODY A SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS. IS WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD. GOT IT GOT IT IN AND I THINK BASED ON OUR LAST BRIEFING. WE WERE WE WERE TOLD THAT IT'S TAKING BETWEEN SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS TO GET VERIFIED THROUGH ID ME WITH THAT. ROUGHLY BECAUSE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SYSTEM. SO THERE HAVE BEEN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE VERIFIED ALREADY- I HAVE NOT HEARD SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS- YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK I THE ME HAS. STEPPED UP- SPECIFICALLY FOR- THE SPOTS THAT BUT THAT STOP PAYS THAT WE PUT ON THOSE ACCOUNTS- AND IF I COULD ADD BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE ADDRESSING ARE THE LONG WAYS ALTHOUGH. THE LONG LEG. THE LONG DELAY THE LONG WAIT TIME THAT WAS INITIALLY EXPERIENCED BY CLAIMANTS WHEN- WE SEND THEM THE LINK AND THEN THEY COULD GO ON THE ID ME AND- VALIDATE THEIR IDENTITY. AND BECAUSE OF THOSE LONG INITIAL WAIT TIMES AND THEY WERE LONG WE'VE EXTENDED THE TIME PERIOD TO LIKE FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH TO ALLOW EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO IN AND VERIFY THEIR IDENTITY WITH THE IDEA ME IF THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THE WAIT TIMES HAVE- FINALLY STARTED TO DECREASE. UP SO THE LONGEST THAT I SAW RECENTLY IS TWO TO THREE HOURS YES THAT IS LONG BUT IT WAS CERTAIN TWICE THAT- A WEEK OR SO BACK. GAGA THE BLOOD JUST WANNA UNDERSTAND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE CASES GOING BACK INTO NOVEMBER DECEMBER IN PART THE REASON THEY ARE TAKING SO LONG IS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE TIME PERIOD WOULD YOU IMPLEMENTED ID ME. YOU HAVE THE TWO WEEK PAUSE WERE YOU WERE THE SYSTEM WAS BEING- TRANSITION AND THEN AGAIN WHAT THE SYSTEM IS UP TO THE SORT OF OUR TIMES OF BEGAN. YOU'RE SAYING ONE WEEK BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE'VE HAD. CUSTOMERS WAITING MONTHS ON THIS ISSUE. IT CAN. YES SPECIFICALLY REFERRING BELIEVE TO THE TO THE FROZEN CORRECT IT'S NOT AS SO I WAS I AM TALKING ABOUT THE STOP PAID THAT WE DID AT THE END OF DECEMBER THERE ARE- OTHER YOU KNOW- AS AS BANK OF AMERICA- MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE ARE WORKING WITH BANK OF AMERICA TO UNFREEZE CARDS FROM PREVIOUS TO- THE SPOT THAT WAS PUT ON AT THE END OF DECEMBER SO THOSE DO TAKE LONGER. HOW HOW LONG DO THEY TAKE. WELL I WILL- I COULDN'T GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC THAT YOU KNOW DATE OR TIME BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT IF WE HAVE A CLAIMANT THAT COMES TO US WITH THE FROZEN CARD AND IF THEY- HAVE VERIFIED THEIR IDENTITY AND ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS AND ALSO CLEAR YOU KNOW THE THOMSON REUTERS AS I MENTIONED PROJECTS- WE WILL WE WILL PAY THEM BY CHECK. IF THEIR CARD IS STILL FROZEN AND I. YOU KNOW. THAT PROBABLY TAKES LONGER BECAUSE IT'S A MANUAL PROCESS- WHEN WE GET CARDS THAT ARE FROZEN. BUT WE ARE WORKING ON THOSE ARE WE TALKING. SIX MONTHS THREE MONTHS. ONE MOMENT HE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOMER. SO I'M NOT I COULDN'T GIVE YOU A TIME AND MAYBE CAROL COULD I DO I DO KNOW THAT ANYTHING THAT IS PREVIOUS TO THE- STRIKE TEAM BACKLOG HAS BEEN CLEARED SO. I IT COULD BE SIX MONTHS BY NOW BUT I DON'T- BUT I DON'T. I'M NOT SURE I DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING TAKES SIX MONTHS BUT- OKAY BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY AN ACCEPTABLE ANSWERS WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH YOUR- NO PROBLEM THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRMAN THING- IT'S VERY IF I THINK OF. THE QUESTION RESPONSES REALLY THE CONCERN THAT WE ALL SHARE ONE CONSTITUENTS CALL OUR OFFICE WE CANNOT TELL A CONSTITUENT WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GONNA TAKE SO IF IT PUTS US IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION TO TRY TO. HELP SOMEONE THAT'S IN NEED WAS GONNA NOT ABLE TO PAY THE RENT TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE WE CAN'T TELL THAT PERSON WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GONNA TAKE THIRTY. THE BETTER SOLUTION TO THAT. I WILL I WILL JUST JUST REITERATE THAT THAT YOU KNOW THIS THE STAFF THEY ARE WORKING- A LOT OF TO CLEAR THE MANUAL. CLAIMS THAT WEHAVE YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE HAVE TO BE DONE MANUALLY UNFORTUNATELY- AND YOU KNOW I MEAN IT I THINK IT CAN TAKE A FEW WEEKS I DON'T KNOW THAT IT TAKES SIX MONTHS BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT CAN TAKE A FEW WEEKS SO- AND YOU KNOW YOU COULD PLEASE CONTINUE TO SEND US THESE. THESE CASES AND YOU KNOW WE CAN WORK THROUGH THEM EDT. THANK YOU MISS PETER NORRIS AT SO I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR BANK OF AMERICA BUT JUST I THINK BEFORE WE CLOSE ON THAT- I KNOW IN MY OFFICE AND I THINK IT'S THE SAME FOR EVERY LEGISLATOR HERE WE HAVE CONSTITUENTS WHO AVE HAD ACTIVE CASES OPEN WITH OUR OUR- OFFICE. SINCE JULY SINCE JULY WE HAVE LITERALLY BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH EDT EVERY WEEK ON BEHALF OF OUR CONSTITUENTS SINCE JULY SO I'M IT THAT IS JUST COMPLETELY COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE I'M OKAY SO LET ME LET ME THE MOVE BACK TO YOU MISTER AHMED- AND ACTUALLY GOT SOME SOME QUESTIONS. FOR YOU RELATED TO AT THE PRESENT ABOUT CARDS AND FRAUD IT BFA BUT BEFORE I JUMP INTO THAT I WOULD FIND IT REALLY HELPFUL JUST TO GET AN OUTLINE OF. OUR CONTRACT WITH BANK OF AMERICA- YEAH WHAT'S THE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE AND HOW MUCH HAS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PAID BANK OF AMERICA. LAST YEAR. I MEAN TO THE EXTENT THAT THE EDT WOULD BE COMFORTABLE PROVIDING THE CONTRACT YOU AND I'M SURE THE CONTRACT CAN BE PROVIDED TO YOU. WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THE BANK IS EARNED LAST YEAR WE'VE ACTUALLY LOST- HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE CONTRACT. BUT WE NEVER REALLY MENTIONED IT BECAUSE IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE SCALE OF THE- HUMAN COST OF THE PANDEMIC IS ABOUT AS MENTIONED. AND WE'VE STAFFED UP- THE CONTRACT AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO ENSURE THE CLAIMANTS ARE SIR PROPERLY. BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY LOST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS BOTH THROUGH LOSSES THE FRAUD LOSSES IMPACTED THANK AMERICA AS WELL. AND THE COST OF SERVICING THE CONTRACT TO BE A HIS EXTENT POSSIBLE HAS ALSO COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS BUT UP BEYOND SECONDARY TO THE HUMAN COST OF THE PANDEMIC. YES I WOULD FIND IT VERY USEFUL FOR EDT IF WE COULD PLEASE GET A COPY OF THAT CONTRACT AS A FOLLOW UP TO THIS HEARING. I'M AND AS A MISTER AHMAD YOU'VE GOT THE SORT OF STARTED TO LEAD TO IT SO. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF. DIFFERENT CATEGORIES I THINK BOTH A FROZEN OF REASONS FOR CARDS BEING FROZEN AND ALSO. FOR THE FRONT THAT'S AN EXPERIENCE SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE WERE IS ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S RIGHT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CARDS PRESENT. AND BECAUSE OF AN EIGHTY D. DECISION. IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU HAVE SEPARATELY FLAGGED CARDS AS SUSPECTED IDENTITY THEFT OR- OTHER. FRAUD REASONS AND ALSO FROZEN THOSE CARDS IS THAT CORRECT AND HOW MANY. OF THOSE CARDS. ARE SUFFERS IN RIGHT NOW. SO IS CORRECT AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS WE HAVE FLAG FOR THE EDT- CARDS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE THE RESULT OF WHAT WE CALL BENEFITS LEGIBILITY FRAUD. NAME RECLAIM WHO SHOULD NOT BE RECEIVING. FUNDS AS YOU ARE PROGRAMS SO ELIGIBLE CLAIMANTS CRIMINALS. AND WE'VE WORKED WITH THE EASY TO IDENTIFY THOSE CLIENTS AND AS OF TODAY THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CARDS THAT ARE STILL FROZEN. AND THAT'S ON TOP OF THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION POOL THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. WHAT WE WHAT WE WEEK WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE LIST OF THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CARDS- OF THAT GROUP THAT. HAVE THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF A STOP PAYMENT AS A AS THE STAFFERS- HAS MENTIONED UNDERSTOOD OKAY BUT YOU BANK OF AMERICA HAS FLAG FOUR NINE EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND CARDS THAT ARE STILL FROZEN AND WHAT IS THE PROCESS. FOR AT RESOLVING THOSE CASES. YES SIR SO IT'S APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CARTS AND THE CLAIMANTS HAVE TO REESTABLISH A RE VERIFY THEIR IDEA L. ELIGIBILITY BY UP TO EDT- ANYONE WHO APPLIES FOR AND WISHES TO MAINTAIN. THEIR STATUS AS LEGITIMATE CLAIM IT HAS TO DO SO BY A CD DVD PROGRAM AND ONCE THEY'VE DONE SO- IS SUBJECT TO THE DECISION MADE FOR FREE THE CARD IN THE FIRST PLACE- BUT ONCE IT'S DONE SO AND WE'RE SATISFIED WE- IN OUR DISCUSSIONS THE EDT WE UNFREEZE THE CART. AND HOW LONG IS THAT TAKING. HAT PERCENTAGE OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN FROZEN BECAUSE OF YOUR ASSESSMENT TURN OUT TO ACTUALLY BE FRAUDULENT VERSES LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. SO I WILL HAVE TO COME BACK TO YOU WITH THE SPECIFIC PERCENTAGES UP BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY SHIFT. WHAT'S UP- AS OF RIGHT NOW WE HAVE UNFROZEN APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THOUSAND CARDS SO THE YOU KNOW THE GRAND TOTAL CARDS OVER FROZEN LIVE WORK GREATER THAN WITH EDTA TO UNFREEZE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THOUSAND CARDS. OKAY I. AND. RIGHT NOW THE SENATE IS AND HOW LONG IS THAT TAKING. FOR PEOPLE TO FOR LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS WHO HAVE GOTTEN SO YOU KNOW IT'S SOME SAY 1015% OF FOLKS THAT ARE ACTUALLY LEGIT THAT YOU HAVE FROZEN. WHAT IS THEIR EXPERIENCE HOW QUICKLY CAN THEY EXPECT. A RESOLUTION. SO IN FOR I CAN'T AND THAT FOR YOU GIVEN- THAT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT FOUR OF RESOLUTION IN READ THEIR ID'S AND VERIFYING THAT THEY ARE IN FACT CLAIM THAT AND THE GIVEN THIS AND THE SCOPE OF THE FROM THAT WE ALL EXTRA- WEATHER'S CAL- THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS BOTH LEGITIMATE AND ILLEGITIMATE TWO EDT. YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THE DIRECTOR HER STAFF ON THIS TOPIC- IT I'M I'M SURE OF THAT AMOUNT OF THAT THAT THAT PERCENTAGE OF TIMES REPLACEMENT VARIES DEPENDING CLOSE BY CLEMENT AND I'M SURE IT ALSO VARIES DEPENDING ON HOW QUICKLY THEY RESPOND BACK TO THE EDT. OKAY AND I'M I'VE HAD ONE QUESTION THAT WAS IS IT TRUE THAT WE DIDN'T NOTIFY- YOU DIDN'T NOTIFY CUSTOMERS BEFORE FREEZING THEIR CARDS AND THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED BY EDT AND INDEED WE DID NOT VERIFY INDIVIDUALS IT'S ALSO IN THE L. A. O.'S ANALYSIS IT IT SAYS THAT BE HAVE A DOES NOT HAVE CUSTOMER CONTACT INFORMATION. IS THAT TRUE. AND SO YOU CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE. SO INITIALLY THERE THERE WERE A SERIES OF CARS THAT WERE FROZEN WHERE WE DIDN'T SEND NOTICES WE NOW SEND NOTICES WHEN A CAR IS FROZEN WHEREVER AND WHENEVER WE CAN- BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR A CARDHOLDER BEYOND THE ADDRESS TO WHICH THE CARD WAS SENSE. AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT THE- THE ADDRESS COULD ALSO CORRESPOND TO A FRAUDULENT ACCOUNT. BOARD ELECTION EQUIPMENT IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND AN ALTERNATE WAY OF SENDING A NOTICE SO WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE DUTY TO DO SO. I'VE HAD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND I WOULD FIND IT REALLY HELPFUL IF I COULD IF WE COULD GET THE FOLLOW UP AROUND THE PERCENTAGE OF AT THE PRISON CARDS ON YOUR SIDE THAT TURNED OUT TO BE LEGITIMATE WITH THE PROCESSES FOR RECTIFYING NOT AND IN SOME SENSE OF THE TIMELINE- THAT SAID THAT IT'S BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND THEN I WILL I WANT TO TURN BACK ACT REALLY QUICKLY TO YOU- EDT SO IT WOULD WHEN YOU SHARED YOUR OPENING REMARKS AND AS WE'VE RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FRAUD THAT'S BEEN EXPERIENCED IT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS YOU POINTED TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS THE THIS NEW PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ALL ALL STATES IN IN IN IN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN AT VICTIMIZED BY ORGANIZED FRAUD RINGS AND NIGHT I CERTAINLY DON'T DISPUTE THAT TIME UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES THE BAD GUYS ARE A LOT MORE CREATIVE THAN THE GOOD GUYS BATES THAT BEING SAID- I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE REALLY HONEST WITH CALIFORNIANS CAN'T WITH OURSELVES ABOUT THE PLACES WHERE OUR PROCESS THESE FAILED US AND I'M TO ME ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PAID BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FRAUD. TO PRISONERS IN CALIFORNIA IN OUT OF STATE AND THE REMEDY FOR THAT AS THE PREVENTION FOR THAT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT'S NOT A SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW WE JUST GOT OUT WAITED BY THE CRIMINALS- SO I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S MOSTLY AN OBSERVATION BUT I'M I FEEL LIKE BLAMING THE P. YOU A AND BLAMING THE FEDS REALLY SEEMS TO BE MISSING A BIG PART OF THE POINT I'M SO IT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE DOING AS W MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY OF THOSE. LIKE STUPID MISTAKES AS WE GO FORWARD SO AND CAN YOU COMMENT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OKAY AT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. FROM ME AND LET ME. YEP YEP LET ME START LET ME START. ASK BY TAPPED CLICK FOLLOW UP. THE OPRAH. WHAT'S GOING ON LIKE A- YOU DIDN'T HAVE WHO ARE AND NANCY CAN HELP ME ON THIS. THERE WERE NOT. GUARDRAILS FOR THE PROGRAM LIKE THERE ARE ON THE U. I. PROGRAM. BECAUSE THE FRAUD HAD BEEN SO RELATIVELY SMALL IN THE U. I. PROGRAM ALL THESE YEARS AND AS WE POINTED OUT IN THE U. I. PROGRAM. IT'S ONLY 5% WHICH IS TYPICAL. ISN'T TYPICAL OVER THE YEARS. THERE WAS A RUSH WHEN THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL TO GET MONEY OUT TO PEOPLE. THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM WAS FLAWED. AND WE GOT VERY LITTLE GUIDANCE FROM DEAL WELL. BEYOND THAT FIRST RELEASE OF THE PROGRAM'S. NEVER BEEN. CLOSE THE COUNTRY AN INCIDENT AS MASSIVE OF EXHIBITORS USING STOLE THE NIGHT BEGAN TO APPLY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. I COULD NOT SPEAK BLAKE ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AT THE TIME AT THE TIME BUT HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE WITH BENEFIT PROGRAMS THIS IS FUND PRESIDENT HOW TO COOK AND PREPARE GIVEN THE CARDINALS ON THIS PROGRAM. OF FROM KIDS I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A STUPID MISTAKE I THINK IT WAS OF. WE WERE JUST. ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT WORST PART ABOUT IT OR ANYTHING LIKE THIS BOB NOW I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING. WE GOT. STRONG PREVENTION SOONER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. NOT SOON ENOUGH. BUT SOONER THIS WAS A COMPLETE SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM. EVERYONE WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING MONEY OUT. THE SOME OF THE GUARDRAILS THAT WE USUALLY HAVE WERE ACTUALLY CHALLENGING IT SYSTEMS. AGAIN TO SLOW DOWN. THERE WAS FEAR THAT THE SYSTEM MIGHT CRASH AND THAT WE WOULD REALLY BE NOT ABLE. TO- THE PEOPLE. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WOULD HAVE. PREPARED FOR SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED AND HAD NEVER HAPPENED ON THE SCALE. THAT DOESN'T HER. PEOPLE ARE STILL SUFFERING WE STILL LOST THE MONEY. THERE'S NO HOPE FOR A SUGAR COATING ACTS AS SECRETARY SINCE AT. WOMAN I CAN ALSO YES I CAN ALSO. MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT THAT YOU D. D. HAS DONE OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS TO MEET ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS ABOUT THE KEY WAY OF COURSE AS AS I MENTIONED IS THAT YOU KNOW THE SELF ASKED AT THE STATION WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST YOU KNOW YOU SAY YOU'VE LOST YOUR JOB BECAUSE OF CULTIVATED AND YOU KNOW WE- IT WAS. A PRODUCT OF THE OF THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES THEY WANTED TO GET MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE QUICKLY TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY- AND THAT WAS PART OF IT THE AUTOMATIC BACKDATING WAS ANOTHER PIECE OF ART- YOU COULD ALSO JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU. LOST YOUR JOB BACK IN MARCH AND YOU COULD GET- FONT AND THERE WAS AGAIN THERE WAS NO CHECK ON THAT IT WAS JUST AUTOMATIC FACT EATING FOR THE FEDERAL ON GUIDELINES. WHEN WE WHEN HE DEFEATS SAW THAT THERE WERE A HUGE SPIKE IN CLAIMS AND I BELIEVE IT WAS AUGUST JULY AUGUST- LATE SUMMER YOU KNOW WE STOPPED. THE AUTOMATIC BACKDATING. UP PRIOR TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TELLING THE REST OF THE STATE'S TO DO THAT. YOU KNOW WE DID SEE THAT WE DID STOP THAT. THE STRIKE TEAM THEN CAME IN YOU KNOW WE YOU BE USED ID ME AS A- SORT OF A AN IDENTITY. AS THE IDENTITY VERIFICATION TOOL I'M SO PEOPLE DO HAVE TO VERIFY THEIR IDENTITY THAT'S A SELFIE THAT'S PART OF IT- WE THEN INSTITUTED- THOMSON REUTERS BASED ON- YOU KNOW TASK FORCE THAT- GOVERNOR NEWSOM PUT TOGETHER WITH. OH YES- AND THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S- YOU KNOW HERE IN SACRAMENTO PLASTER COUNTY AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- AND THEY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS WAS TO USE. THOMSON REUTERS TO TRY TO- PREVENT SOME OF THE FRAUD ESPECIALLY. YOU MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY OF THE- THE PRISON FRAUD WHICH YOU KNOW WE NOW AS I BELIEVE YOU KNOW EVERYONE KNOWS THAT WE NOW HAVE A DAY THAT I'M SHARING AGREEMENT WITH THE C. R. ALONG WITH STATE HOSPITALS TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE CROSSMATCH ON INMATE DATA AND THOMSONREUTERS ALSO HELPED OUT THROUGHOUT- THE COUNTRY AND IN LOCAL JAILS LOCAL JAILS AND- PRISONS- AND SO THAT THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE BILL BASIC STEPS THAT. YOU KNOW WE PUT TOGETHER I MEAN WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH- YOU KNOW THE DA IS AS I MENTIONED ON THE TASK FORCE TO- COME UP WITH NEW. WAYS WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR ANYTHING THAT YOU KNOW IS HELPFUL WE MEET WITH YOU KNOW VENDORS ALL THE TIME ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THEIR- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE THAT. THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL- WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO- HEY CLAIMANTS FORCED THE BALL BUT PAY. THE CLAIMANTS WHO ARE ENTITLED AND ARE IN NEED- AND THEN OF COURSE YOU ALSO AT THE SAME TIME TO PREVENT THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS. OF FRAUD WHICH THE IN. I FIVE WHEN A LAST LAST. COMMON OR OR QUESTION TO THIRTY OTHERS. ALREADY SYSTEMS THAT DO CROSS. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS AGAINST. THE RECORDS AB SO ARE WE PART OF ANY KIND OF LIKE INTERSTATE INFORMATION SHOP WHERE WE CAN GATHER BEST PRACTICES AND IDEAS AND LEARN. FROM OTHER STATES SO THAT WE DO NOT MAKE OBVIOUS MISTAKES GOING FORWARD. SO WE ARE WE ARE PART OF- OUT. NO THAT'S A BRILLIANT. OH I'M SORRY OKAY WE HAD A WE ARE PART OF- NASSIM NOW AS WELL WHICH IS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE WORKFORCE IS AND WE DO- YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS WE ARE PART OF THAT AND WE DO TALK TO OTHER STATES AND- YOU KNOW. I KNOW THAT EVERYONE IS TIRED OF SAYING OF ME SAYING THIS BUT EVERY STATE IS IN THE SAME SITUATION AS CALIFORNIA WE ALL HAVE THE SAME EXACT. PROBLEMS ON THAT OTHER STATES HAVE WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW FRAUD OR YOU KNOW PAYING PEOPLE TIMELY WHATEVER IT IS I MEAN ALL STATES. ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION I'M SO WE DO WE DO WORK WITH NOW THAT'S WHAT AND WE DO SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHER STATES WASHINGTON STATE HAS BEEN. A GREAT PARTNER- WITH US YOU KNOW WE ARE ON THE PHONE WITH THEM MULTIPLE TIMES- SOMETIMES A WEEK I FEEL LIKE I'M TO TRY TO GET YOU KNOW. TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE DEALING WITH- YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR SITUATION THERE SO WE DO. TALK TO OTHER STATES YES. WHAT WRONG BUT IN THE BEGINNING WHEN WE WANTED TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH CORRECTIONS WAS IT NOT THE CASE THAT IT WAS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS NOT LEGALLY POSSIBLE TO DO THAT. CORRECT THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS IN STATUTE AND THE- ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE- HERE. AND AT THE STATE LEVEL- BASICALLY ALLOW THE DATA SHARING BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF FRAUD- IN THE P. WAY SYSTEM- SEEING THAT THERE WERE THERE WAS THIS YOU KNOW MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FRAUD THEY STATE. FINDS THAT- THAT WE COULD SHARE THE DATA CDCR. COULD SHARE THE DATA WITH EDT. WELL THE GOOD NEWS IS PACKING A BUNCH OF YOU CAN ACTUALLY WRITE NEW LAWS ARE UP TO DATE ARE OUTDATED LAWS AND IN MAY IN FACT I HAVE INTRODUCED A BILL. WITH MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE ROOM TO ADDRESS THIS THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE BUT BUT PLEASE I THINK PART OF AS MOVING FORWARD IN A PARTNERSHIP AND PART OF US MOVING FORWARD INVOLVES BETTER COMMUNICATION IF THERE ARE ROADBLOCKS. REACH OUT TO US SO THAT WE CAN HELP WRESTLING ON AND YOU KNOW AND IF WE'RE IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS AND WE'RE FOR FREEZING ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ACCOUNTS. PLEASE REACH OUT TO US AND LET US KNOW SO THAT WE CAN HELP MESSAGES START CONSTITUENTS- SO. THAT IS MY HAD MY PARTING COMMENT IS JUST THANK YOU HE'S LET'S LET'S IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION SO THAT WE CAN IMPROVE SERVICE FOR TAKE YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. REALLY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT AND YOU CAN COUNT. ON IT. WE WILL BE JACQUI. THANK YOU FOR THEM IS PETRIE-NORRIS IN THE THIRD OF A- COLLABORATION AND SOLUTION FINDING I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO BE. I DO WANT TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THOUGH AND THAT IS IN TERMS OF. THE SYSTEMS THAT WE USE COULD. COULD THIS HAVE BEEN PREVENTED COULD THIS HAVE BEEN AVOIDED WATER THE GUARD RAILS ARE BEING PUT IN PLACE IN THE FUTURE WHAT THE SYSTEM. OF THE FUTURE THAT WE NEED NOW LOOKING LIKE. A IN PREPARING FOR THIS FOR THIS HEARING. WE ALSO DISCOVERED ON THE EDT WEBSITE. A DECEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY NINETEEN. LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT IN WHICH THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF EDT ADDRESSED THE LETTER TO. SECRETARY SU. AND IN THAT REPORT ON PAGE ELEVEN. IT LAYS OUT SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES STATING. THE D. THE ET DE AND MIND YOU THIS IS. FOR MONTHS BEFORE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY BEFORE WE ALL WENT INTO. A STAY AT HOME ORDERS. THE EDT IS NOT OPERATING WITH MAXIMUM MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS DUE TO VARIOUS WORKFORCE. AND SUCCESSION COMPONENTS WHICH HAVE EITHER NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED. FEHLER TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES COULD REDUCE THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO SUSTAIN. A ROBUST WORKFORCE AND MEET ITS MANDATE AND VISION MISSION AND OBJECTIVES. THIS IS NOT A REPORT THAT IS UNAVAILABLE IT IS ON YOUR WEBSITE. IT STATES WHAT'S NEEDED IN TERMS OF. WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE DO TO IMPROVE IT THE THUMBS YET IT HAS DONE NOTHING UP UNTIL THIS POINT. HERE WE FIND OURSELVES NOW IN THE SITUATION. I GEN WILMA CARRILLO LET ME JUST SAY THAT IT. EDT HAS DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS IT HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH. AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE INFORMATION ON HOW ON HOW WE HAVE IMPROVED OUR- OUR SYSTEMS I WOULD BE GLAD TO PROVIDE THAT TO YOU BUT REALLY. AREN'T I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR- DIRECTION IN SEE WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING A LOT OF TEACHERS WE'RE GOING TO BE INVOLVING. THANKS FOR THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH MEMBER QUESTIONS WE STILL HAVE A ROOM FULL OF MEMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS BOTH THE EDT AS WELL AS BANK OF AMERICA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WAITING I HOPE THAT WE HAVE RESOLVED THE TECHNICAL. ISSUES I KNOW WE'RE A LITTLE BIT LATER WE'RE LOOKING TO YOU FOR THE NEXT QUESTION. GREAT CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN GET YOU PLEASE CONTENT OKAY. GREAT pGONNA START WITH SOME QUESTIONS FOR BANK OF AMERICA REALLY FOLLOWING UP ON MISTER SPEAKER NORRIS'S QUESTIONS RELATED TO HOW WE CAME INTO THIS CONTRACT IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. I HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT- THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL THAT BANK OF AMERICA PROVIDED TO EDT AND WINNING THE EXCLUSIVE CARE ACT AND IN THAT PROPOSAL. BANK OF AMERICA REPRESENTED THAT IT WOULD QUOTE EMPLOY THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SECURITY AND FRAUD SAFEGUARDS. QUOTE PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO EMERGING FRAUD TRENDS. AND QUOTE EMPLOYEE EXTENSIVE FRAUD MONITORING NOW CLEARLY WE'RE HERE BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OF EDT BANK OF AMERICA ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED IN FROZEN MISTER AHMAD I'M WONDERING. IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH US DO YOU FEEL THAT BANK OF AMERICA DID EMPLOY THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SECURITY AND FRAUD IN THIS INSTANCE. AND BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HEARD OF SIMILAR FRAUD WITH OTHER CONSUMER DEBIT ACCOUNTS. IS THERE A DIFFERENCE AND FRAUD MONITORING. ON EIGHTY ACCOUNTS VERSUS CONSUMER DEBIT ACCOUNTS. BOB PRESS MY COLLEAGUE BILL FOX REPORT TO ADDRESS THE- THE DIFFERENCES APPROACH. THANK YOU THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK I THINK IT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THE TYPE OF PRIDE. THAT WE HAVE PAID THAT MUCH PORTFOLIO BY IN MARCH IS SOMETHING THAT WE CALL BENEFITS ELIGIBILITY FIVE SO THERE THEY WERE THERE THE PRODUCT- FOR FRAUD NETWORK IS ACTUALLY ACTUALLY. DEPRIVING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I BY BYE EITHER'S FEELING AND I. AND SUBMITTING THAT I. WORK AT A DIFFERENT PLACE WITH PERSON TO RECEIVE. BY STEALING CARDS OUT OF MAILBOX WE THAT WITH WITH- WITH CRIME NETWORKS DOING THAT- ANY SORT OF THE- THAT WOULD IN THAT NGUYEN NEIGHBOR THEM TO. OVER THAT AT WITH. RIGHT AND FIELD ACCOUNT THAT THE APPRENTICE FROM TYPICAL TRANSIT PRICE. AND IT SOME THAT WE- I CAN YOU I I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR. ACT OF AMERICA POOR FIFTEEN THAN AND I THINK WE'RE PRETTY GOOD AT IT WILL GOOD AT THE TRANSIT PRICE AND WE'RE VERY GOOD AT ACCOUNT TAKEOVER FRAUD BUT- I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY KIND OF ATTACK LIKE THIS IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE. AND CANDIDLY I WAS IN THE GOVERNMENT WORKING ON THESE ISSUES BEFORE THEN. AND I DON'T I THINK THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED. SO WE STARTED DETECTING THE- ALL PROGRAMS IN IN LATE APRIL MAY. WE STARTED DETECTING THE AND LATE JUNE AND JULY. AND BY AUGUST WE HAVE WE RECOGNIZED THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS UNPRECEDENTED. WE'VE HEARD FROM COLLEAGUES IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT THEY BELIEVE- THAT THAT CRIMINAL NETWORKS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN SITTING ON A CASH. STOLEN IDENTITIES OR SOME TALKING. AND HAVE A WHEN WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUMP. AND THEY HAVE FOUND THIS OPPORTUNITY. AND I THINK THAT SO IN A WAY- BDD IS EVERY BIT AS MUCH THE VICTIM HERE AS AS AS YOU KNOW THEY ARE YOU KNOW TOTAL SO THEY THEY'VE BEEN THEY'VE BEEN DECEIVED BY A LOT OF FALSE IDENTITIES BY A LOT OF STOLEN IDENTITIES THEY THEY BELIEVE. ONE FOURTH OF BELIEVE THAT IDENTITIES FROM ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE TO THE- EQUIFAX AND MASTERCARD BREACHES AND TARGET BREACHES ARE ARE ALL IDENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN USED. FOR THAT- THIS PERIOD I WOULD ACTUALLY REALLY APPLIED EDT PUT THE STEPS THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN WITH WEB ID ME AND WITH AND WITH- THOMSON REUTERS WE HAVE OUR OWN PROPRIETARY FILTERS THAT WE- THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE EMPLOYED IN TRYING TO DETECT THIS FRAUD AND FRANKLY THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE FOUND. RIGHT THAT THE CARDS THAT THAT REMAIN FROZEN IS WHERE WE HAVE FOUND THAT THAT THAT PRODUCT SO I THINK I THINK YOU KNOW WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE V. D. AS WE HAVE YOU KNOW IF THEY CLEAR- WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH THOMPSON REUTERS WE CAN. WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO GET THAT I'M PRESIDENT I THINK IT IS YOU KNOW IN A QUICKER WAY- BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID DOING WE CAN'T WE CAN'T IDENTIFY MISTER WORK VERIFY. THE PLANE I INTERRUPT. SHORTLY COULD I. YOU KNOW AS I COULD GET THAT HERE YOU YOUR X IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT THERE'S FRAUD BEYOND AMERICA CONTROL AND OF THAT TO ADVANTAGE OF TOP AND WHEN AFTER EDT SO ONE. ONE QUESTION THAT THE PUBLIC IS ASKING US EVERY DAY AS YOU WELL KNOW IS THESE DEBIT CARDS THESE EDYTA CARDS AT YOUR BANK HAS PROVIDED DO NOT INCLUDE EMV CHIP TECHNOLOGY AND YOUR OWN WEBSITE SAYS THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN AROUND FOR TWENTY YEARS IT'S THE CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD SECURITY STANDARD IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN YOUR BANK ANNOUNCED THAT YOU WOULD INCLUDE EMV CHIPS AND ALL NEW AND REISSUED CONSUMER DEBIT CARDS. SOMEHOW THOUGH FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS BANK OF AMERICA EDT DATA CARDS TO INCLUDE THESE ANTI FRAUD EMV CHIPS FOR SECURITY AND MY CONSTITUENTS ARE SAYING HOUSE AT THE BANK OF AMERICA TREATS US LIKE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS WHEN IT COMES TO FRAUD. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO. WELL MY RESPONSE IS THAT THE CHIPS WOULD DO VERY LITTLE IF ANYTHING. FOR THE TYPE OF PRODUCT WAS TALKING ABOUT- IT WHICH IS VERY USEFUL IN A CONTACT THE TRANSACTIONAL FRAUD. RIGHT BECAUSE- I CAN'T BE CAN'T BE COPIED ILLEGALLY OR OR CAN BE CAN BE DUPLICATED MY COLLEAGUES ON THE ON THE CALL CAN TELL YOU MORE ABOUT CHIP. TECHNOLOGY AND WHY WE MADE THE DECISIONS WE MAKE THAT BUT I. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT THAT COME UP STANDPOINT OF DETECTING BENEFITS CRIED. IF I IF I GO TO THE V. P. AND I AND I USED TO FEED THEM. AND THEY ISSUE ME A CARD WHETHER IT'S GOT A CHIP OR NOT. IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO I I'VE STILL GOT A I'VE GOT AN ACCOUNT. THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE. THAT SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF PRIDE THAT WE HAVE BEEN WE SEAT BY THE WAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE- WE SEE TRANSACTIONAL CRIED. IN THE COURT OF. OF OUR WORK HERE AND WE CAN MONITOR THAT VERY CLOSELY. AND BUT THAT TRANSACTIONAL PRODUCT QUITE FRANKLY VERY CLOSE TO IF NOT ALMOST THE SAME. AS THE TYPE OF TRANSACTIONAL PRIDE THAT WE SEE IN OUR IN OUR NORMAL CARD BUSINESS. GO GO AND I THINK YOU KNOW I. I DO THINK THAT THE CHIP TECHNOLOGY IS A BIT OF A- RED HERRING AS IT RELATES TO. HELLO RELATE TO BENEFIT FROM. YEAH SO WHAT CAN I. NUMBER TWO WHY MADE THE TRIP. YEP STEPS IF I IF I COULD JUST TO MY COLLEAGUES. OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS THAT THE THAT THE FRAUD HAS. HERE THAT HAS BEEN. BUT AS VICTIMIZED EDT SMALLS OURSELVES AND THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT HAPPENS WELL BEFORE. THANKS OF ALL THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT BENEFITS LEGIBILITY AND THAT'S WHY GOTTEN. AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. ONE PERSON POINTED OUT TO US THAT THE SOPHISTICATED NETWORKS HAVE BEEN SITTING. ON TOP OF MILLIONS OF IDPS THREE YEARS LOOKING FOR THIS TYPE OF OPPORTUNITY SO IS OF A SCALE AND OF A TYPE BUT NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. AND WITH RESPECT TO YOU TO YOUR TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT- CHIPS PURPOSES OF MAG STRIPES. REMEMBER THE MAGS MAGNETIC STRIP OF MAGNETIC STRIP. I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE- ANSWERED IT AND IT HAS A EVEN AS A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT WOULD SAY. IF SOMEONE POSSESSES AN ACCOUNTS IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE UNDERLYING CARD IS A CHIP OR A STRIKE. BECAUSE THEY ARE IN POSSESSION OF THE ACCOUNT ITSELF AND THEY CAN STEP OUT OF THE WAY THEY WANT THEY CAN BRING THE CARDS- IT'S ONLY WHEN SOMEONE TRIES TO- BASICALLY COPY A CAR THAT'S BEING USED. ON BEHALF OF LEGITIMATE CLAIM THAT THAT THE CHIP STARTS TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON TRANSACTIONAL FRAUD. THE ORIGINAL RP THAT YOU REFERENCED SINCE YOU YOU HAVE IT AND YOU BROUGHT IT. THE ORIGINAL RP REQUESTS MAGNETIC STRIP STRIP CARDS A MAGNETIC STRIPE CARDS- SO THAT'S WHAT THE. ORIGINAL RP REQUESTED BEHALF THE PROGRAM. DO YOU AGAIN FEEL THAT THOUGH THE BANK OF AMERICA HAS EMPLOYED THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SECURITY FRAUD SAFEGUARDS THE SITUATION. EXACTLY THANK YOU I. I DO AS FAR AS WE I WILL BE ERY CANDID WITH YOU WE ALONG WITH I THINK EVERYONE LAW ENFORCEMENT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN PLAYING CATCH UP ON THAT WE HAVE DEPLOYED. SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND- ON THAT AND BY THE WAY IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA ALONG CALIFORNIA BEING THE SEVENTH LARGEST ECONOMY ON THE PLANET IT IS IT IS IT IS HUGE HERE. WE PROVIDE THIS SERVICE TO OTHER STATE AND WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM- ACROSS THAT PORTFOLIO SO I THINK I THINK WHAT WAS YOUR- THE REALITY IS I THINK WE HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO TRY TO DETECT IT NOW THE PROBLEM IS NO DETECTION. METHODOLOGY IS PERFECT AND CAN CATCH INNOCENT PEOPLE AND THEN THAT AND SO FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE OUT OF THAT AND THAT AND GET THE MONEY THAT THEY THEY SO DESPERATELY NEEDED IS CRITICAL AND THAT THAT FOR WORKING WITH THE EDT. BOND VERIFICATION- OF IDENTITY AND ELIGIBILITY IT'S SO KEY BECAUSE ONCE TAT HAPPENS WE. CAN THEN MOVE RELATIVELY QUICKLY. I TO FOLLOW UP ON ON THE SITUATION AND IN OUR WE IT WILL GIVEN WHAT IS HOW. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE FAR FAR WORSE OFF AND- I KNOW IN THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN BANK OF AMERICAN EDT. YOUR BANK COMMITTED TO A- RELIABILITY POLICY FOR THE AUTHORIZED USER BDD DEBIT CARDS AND- YOU COMMITTED TO EDT CARD HOLDERS THAT THEY WOULD NOT INCUR ANY LIABILITY FOR THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE CAR I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THIS. BUT AS YOU CAN LIKELY IMAGINE WE'RE HEARING FROM MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT THEIR CLAIMS ARE SUMMARILY REJECTED OR SIMPLY IGNORED WE'VE HAD EDT CARDHOLDERS WHO REPORT UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS. EVEN THOUGH THEIR CARDS ARE ACTIVATED OR EVEN USED AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. YOU CAN TELL US RIGHT NOW OF COURSE WE'RE ADDRESSING THESE CLAIMS BUT WE'RE NOT HEARING THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THOUSAND CONSTITUENTS FOR THOMAS THE OPPOSITE. HOW CAN WE AS POLICYMAKERS HOW CAN THE PUBLIC HAVE A TRULY TRANSPARENT COUNTING THAT- THAT INDIVIDUAL. EDT HOPE- CARDHOLDERS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO RESOLVE THEIR CLAIMS AND HAVE ZERO LIABILITY. YEAH SO FIRST OF ALL. LOOK AGAIN WEEK WEEK WE RECOGNIZE THE SCALE OF THE- REALLY THE SCALE OF THE ISSUE AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S IMPACTING INDIVIDUALS THAT'S NOT LOST ON US IN ANYWAY THAT'S WHY WE COMMITTED THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL STAFF TO BOTH BE CALL CENTERS AS WELL AS THE CLAIMS PROCESSING. AND EDUCATION UNITS THAT LOOK AT EACH CORNER. I WOULD ALSO SAY. THAT IF A CLAIM IS REJECTED. WE SENT A CLAIM IN A LETTER BECAUSE AT THAT POINT WE DO HAVE THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION. AND WE AGREE THAT THE CLAIMANT WANTS TO REVISIT THE REJECTION OF THE CLAIM. WE WILL AUTOMATICALLY DO SO AND WE WILL RECONSIDER THE CLAIM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE DO ASK THE CLINTON FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. BUT WE COMMIT TO THAT AND WE COULD WE WILL CONTINUE TO COMMIT TO THAT. IF WE RECEIVE THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO APPROVE A CLAIM WE PROVIDE IMMEDIATELY. BUT THOSE ARE ALL THE STEPS WE'VE TAKEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS- WORKED WITH RESPECT TO THIS RELIABILITY BECAUSE OF POLICY TRANSACTION FRAUD. WE HOPE THAT POLICY IF IT'S A LEGITIMATE CLAIM THAT. LEGITIMATE CARD AND SOMEONE HAS. USED HER CARD. A DIFFERENT LOCATION IN AUTHORIZED MATTER WE INVESTIGATE AND WE- REFUND OR CREDIT THE FUNDS BACK TO THE CAP. BUT WE DO. HOW MANY REJECTIONS HAVE YOU SENT OUT AT THIS POINT TO CLAIMS. I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT INFORMATION. OKAY I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE WE WE'RE HEARING VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS AND I DON'T WANNA GET INTO THE BACK AND FORTH THAT YOU HAD WITH MISTER TANG ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS WHAT YOU DESCRIBED AS FAR AS THOUSANDS OF BANK OF AMERICA EMPLOYEES ASSISTING CUSTOMERS IS A VERY DIFFERENT. REALITY FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS AND IF I COULD JUST QUOTE A RECENT ARTICLE IN CALMATTERS FROM A BANK OF AMERICA CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WHO SAID QUOTE WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWED TO TELL CUSTOMERS A TIMEFRAME BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CLUE EVERY DAY I TALKED TO THREE PEOPLE WITH THE SAME STORY I PRAY FOR THEM AFTER MY SHIFT MARKETS. IT'S NOT JUST OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE TELLING US IT'S YOUR EMPLOYEES. WHO BUT IN SAYING THAT THE SERVICES ARE ADEQUATE SO I JUST WANNA ONE STATE THAT. YOU WANT ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU I KNOW YOU WERE ASKED A QUESTION OF. HOW MUCH AS BANKAMERICA MADE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. COULD YOU TELL US BEFORE THIS YEAR. HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BANK OF AMERICA MAKE ON FEES GENERATED BY THE USE OF EDT DEBIT CARD SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROGRAM. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION WITH ME. OKAY IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL- AND I WOULD ALSO ASK AROUND CUSTOMER SERVICE I THINK WE ARE HAVING A SERIOUS DISCONNECT OUR- EXPERIENCE WE ARE STAYING IN ON OUR END IS THAT OUR- CONSTITUENTS ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED. BY YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU ARE SAYING THE OPPOSITE. CAN YOU PROVIDES INFORMATION TO ASSURE US. THAT STATISTICS OF HOW MANY CALLS ARE BEING ANSWERED WITHIN WHAT TIME PERIOD HOW LONG IT TAKES RESOLVE CASES- REJECTION RIGHT- THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE ANY DISABILITY. I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T TO THE BILL VISIBILITY. WILL WORK WITHOUT BRIAN BUTLER TEAM TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THIS ABILITY. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT SOME I WANT TO ASK REALLY SORT OF ONE QUESTION TO- MATTER DIRECTOR- AND MAKE A COMMENT AND FIRST OF ALL AS I SAID BEFORE JUST APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT TO. I WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW WITH WITH YOUR TEAM VERTICALLY WITH MISS WILLIAMS AND THAT'S FOR ITS- I'M HOPEFUL THAT THERE IS A LEADERSHIP TEAM THAT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE THAN THE TEAM WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH IN THE PAST. BUT A COMMENT- IT WHEN YOU WERE DISCUSSING THE BACKLOG WITH MISTER SALAS. I WOULD JUST SAY THIS IS A QUESTION THAT HAS ARISEN AT EVERY SINGLE HEARING IT'S BEEN REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BACKLOG IS. THE NUMBERS NOT ONLY KEEP CHANGING BUT- WERE CONFUSED AS TO WHAT'S IN AND WHAT'S OUT SO I JUST SUGGEST. THAT AS MUCH COMMUNICATION YOU CAN PROVIDE. US ON THAT AS REGULARLY AS YOU CAN WOULD BE WITH THE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL. I WANT TO I DO WANT TO ASK ONE QUESTION AROUND WHERE ARE WE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT YOU KNOW- THAT I HAD SENT IN A LETTER. SIGNED BY SEVENTY OF OUR COLLEAGUES THAT HAD SUGGESTED THE STRIKE TEAM WERE HAPPY WHEN GOVERNMENT SUPPORT WITH THAT- WE THOUGHT THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE SENSE. YOUR PREDECESSOR HAD COMMITTED TO US THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SEND US REGULAR UPDATES OF WHERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED AN UPDATE IN QUITE SOME TIME TO ONE HOUR STAND WHERE WE'RE- ALL. HEY YEAH I HAVE THAT IN FOR. WHEN SHE PARK AND WE WERE. YOUR CHECK CAN'T FIND IN MIND. I CAN'T YEAH KNOW THAT WE HAVE DONE A BIT AND YOU START YOU SO APART IF- IF WE MISUNDERSTOOD AND YOU WORKS TO DO. OBJECT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY BEEN PUTTING UP THE EVERY OTHER WEEK ON OUR WEBSITE WE CAN MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE PUSH OR YOU KNOW SEND. IT IF THAT'S WHAT YOUR MOTHER WOULD LIKE BUT THEY'VE BEEN AVAILABLE ON THE- EDT WEBSITE EVERY WEEK EVERY OTHER WEEK WE MAKE UPDATES SO TO GIVE YOU STEINORTH YOU KNOW THERE'S ONE HUNDRED STRIKE TEAM. RECOMMENDATIONS THERE WAS SOME DUPLICATIONS AND- AT ONE HOME. TO DATE WE HAVE COMPLETED RECOMMENDATIONS AND- WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH THAT- BASED ON ALEJO'S TESTIMONY PURELY THERE MUST BE SOME WITH YOU CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AT NO PROBLEM DO NOT. THE PICTURE COMPLETION IS COMPLETION- SO. THAT'S THE UPDATE BOARD AS OF TODAY. SENATE WHEN THOSE REGULATIONS WILL BE. YES WE ARE CAROL WE DID HAVE IN MY TESTIMONY MMHM SOME INFORMATION ON WHERE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE FORTY EIGHT. TO FIFTY HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WE HAD STARTED ONE OF THE MID TERM ONCE. AND WE HAVE PRODUCTS ALSO STARTED ON THE LONG TERM ONES JUST CAN'T FIND IT IN MY OKAY WE ARE OKAY LET ME GIVE THAT. SO ALL THE FORTY TWO TERM RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED BY STAFF. THIRTY EIGHT NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS WERE OUTLINED IN THE REPORT OF BILLS. OUR HARD WORKING STAFF HAVE COMPLETED 15% 73% ARE IN PROGRESS. AND TWELVE HAD NOT YET BEEN STARTED. NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ANTICIPATED TO REQUIRE BETWEEN THREE MONTHS AND A YEAR TO IMPLEMENT. OF THE LAW OF THE TEN LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS 10% ARE COMPLETE AND 90% ARE IN PROGRESS. THESE LONG TERM RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ANTICIPATED TO TAKE ABOUT A YEAR WE HAVE A STRIKE TEAM AND INTERNAL STRIKE TEAM THAT MEETS REGULARLY TO STRATEGIZE AND DIRECT EFFORTS. TO ACCELERATE THE COMPLETION. OF THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS AND TO. INCREASE TRANSPARENCY ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THAT THEIR WE NEED A BETTER STRATEGY SO THE LEGISLATURE CAN WILL FORM WE HAVE ALSO INCLUDED STRIKING RECOMMENDATION TRACKER ON. THE WEBSITE AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO ACCELERATING THE COMPLETION. OF THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS. GREAT WHAT ONE QUESTION I RELAYED TO I KNOW ONE OF THE DASHBOARDS IT'S OUT THERE IS IT APPEARS THAT FROM THE SECOND WEEK OF THIS MONTH. THERE WERE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND NEARLY NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNIQUE CALLERS BUT ONLY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THOSE CALLS WERE ACTUALLY ANSWER BY STAFF. COULD YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OTHER CALLERS I MEAN I'M ASSUMING THAT IS WHY OUR STAFF FOR LEGISLATIVE STAFFER WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND FROM YOU WHAT WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH THE SCHOLARS. CAROL ABSOLUTELY SO AS WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING- SINCE THE FALL SINCE AND PRIOR TO ME JOINING CALL CENTER THE CONTACT CENTER ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO IS UP TO BE MODERNIZED- AS YOU ALSO AWARE. MORE CALLS THE STAFF COULD HANDLE WE'VE BROUGHT ON IN- BUT- WE HAVE RESUMED HIRING IF YOU RECALL FIFTEEN RECOMMENDED WE SEIZE ALL HIRING THIS WAS IN SEPTEMBER AND WILL ALLOW THE MORE EXPERIENCED STAFF TO ACTUALLY WORK ON THE CLAIMS RESOLVED THE CLAIMS AND SO THAT GAP CREATED A GAP IN SERVICE. IN ONE THAT- STILL EXIST TODAY. A PRIMARILY BECAUSE ON ANY GIVEN WEEK. WE WERE SAVE UPWARDS OF THREE MILLION CALLS THREE MILLION CALLS WE HAVE- SURE I HAVE THE STAMPING NUMBER HERE IN FRONT OF ME- WELL WE ARE ABOUT TO HIRE. TWO HUNDRED MORE PEOPLE THE STAFF CUSTOMER SERVICE SO TO ME WHAT RHETORIC WHAT'S MORE PRESSING IN THIS IS- YOU'LL HEAR A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS FROM US IS IT WILL NEVER HAVE ENOUGH EMPLOYEES FOR THE CLAIMANTS THAT NEED US- THE PAST THE PRESENT THE FUTURE ANY MODERN DAY CONTACT CENTER. YOU DON'T YOU DON'T STAFF ABOUT WHAT YOU DO IS YOU PARTNER A WELL FUNCTIONING CONTACT CENTER WE ARE STILL IN THAT STATE PREPARE WITH ROBUST AUTOMATION SELF SERVICE TOOLS THAT A PERSON COULD DO. ANYTHING THAT INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE COULD DO NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM THEIR- YOU KNOW FROM THEIR TRAINING MANUAL I MEAN WE ALLOW THAT AUTOMATION TO HAPPEN WE ARE MODERNIZING THE CONTEXT AND WE FINALLY STOOD UP THE COMMAND CENTER- YOU PROBABLY YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS IN OCTOBER DURING THE TESTIMONY. SO THAT. THE COMMAND CENTER WILL BE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE TRAINING FOR ALL THE MODERNIZATION OF TOTALS WE ARE ABSOLUTELY INTERESTED IN BRINGING IN THE VIRTUAL HOLD TECHNOLOGY WHICH ALLOWS. A COLOR. TO ACTUALLY SCHEDULE A CALL BACK NO EVEN WITH THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY IF THEY'RE STILL CAPACITY ISSUES BUT WE THINK WITH THE ADVANCEMENT IN THE PASSAGE OF TIME THERE'S TECHNOLOGY THAT TO ACTUALLY WORK FOR EATING. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE INVOLVED IN RIGHT NOW WHEN IT COMES TO CONTACT CENTERS YES COLORS ARE STILL WAITING FOR HOURS. THEY ARE WE HAVE FINALLY MODERNIZE THE PLATFORM THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE WHOLE TWO ONE TO HEAR TO ISSUE SO THERE IS ONE PLATFORM THAT ALL OF OUR CONTACT CENTRE STAFF. OR FUNDING ON AND THAT'S WORKING FINE WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS IT'S CALL. SMART ROUTING AND IT SHOULD LITERALLY IT'S STILL IN ITS INFANCY TAKE THE CALL TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. BASED ON THEIR PROFILE IN THEIR HISTORY AND WHAT THEIR TRUE NEEDS ARE WHERE THEY. ARE IN OUR SYSTEM THEY DON'T HAVE TO KEEP. LIVING THROUGH THE LEVELS STAFF. SO I'LL STOP THERE AND LET'S. AND YOU CAN IN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT. EACH E. G. R. HAS GOTTEN ANY MAJOR UPGRADES IN AT LEAST TEN YEARS. THE RULES AND REGULATIONS UNDER WHICH IT OPERATES HAVE NOT BEEN REVIEWED LOOK FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS. AND WE THIS IS THIS IS A NEW DAY AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE BETTER SHAPE UP HERE. ARE WE NEED TO DO MORE EDUCATION OF PEOPLE WE NEED TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS SAYS ARE PEOPLE YOU KNOW I KNOW YOUR YOUR OFFICE STAFF HAVE BEEN. I CAN DEFICIT IN WORKING WITH OUR STAFF TO HANDLE THESE CLAIMS I GET CALLS. I GET EMAILS FROM PEOPLE THIS IS JUST IT'S GOT TO GET BETTER AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT BETTER. THANK YOU UP I BY THE WELL JUST NOTICE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LAST TEN YEARS- YOUR DEPARTMENT DID RECEIVE. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WENT TO THE DEVOID CONSULTANCY TO UPGRADE YOUR I. T. SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION WITH OBVIOUSLY VERY LITTLE. YOU THAT- YOU HAVE IN THE LEGISLATOR VERY WILLING PARTNERS TO BOTH WORK WITH YOU TO OPERATE THAT TECHNOLOGY AND TO SIMPLIFY WHAT YOU JUST REFERENCED I KNOW I THINK IT WORKS WITH OTHER QUESTIONS. I JUST WANNA ASK ONE FINAL QUESTION TO MYSTERIUM SANTANA- BECAUSE I IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO TAKE A MOMENT TO HIGHLIGHT THE ISSUE OF LANGUAGE ACT. AND ENGLISH AT HOME. WHEN THE RECENT STRIKE TEAM REPORT INDICATED THAT IF ENGLISH IS NOT YOUR FIRST LANGUAGE YOU ARE COMPLETELY COMPLETELY- UNABLE TO ACCESS ITS EDT SYSTEM- THE SYSTEM'S FAILURE TO ADDRESS LANGUAGE ISSUES HAS BEEN VERY STARK FOR ME BUSTS AND I'D LIKE TO ASK A MIST SERUM SANTANA- I KNOW YOUR TESTIMONY A LITTLE CUT OFF BEFORE COULD YOU. SKETCH OUT ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK IS THE ROAD MAP FOR WHAT EDT SHOULD DO WHEN IT COMES TO LANGUAGE ACCESS. THANK YOU- THIS ISN'T SHOWS CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES GREAT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND THESE- MY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT JUST MINE ALONE WE HAVE WORKING WITH A COALITION OF LANGUAGE ACCESS ADVOCATES AND ATTORNEYS. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO- LEAVE THE COMMITTEE WITH IS THAT THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IN PROVIDING LANGUAGE ACCESS IN STATES AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA. AS THIS REQUIRES EDT TO BE FLEXIBLE IN HOW IT SERVES VARIOUS INTERESTING TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT EDT SHOULD ACT UPON IT EXERCISE THAT FLEXIBILITY IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO DO NOT SPEAK THE DOMINANT LANGUAGES AND COMMUNITIES WITH LOW LITERACY UNLIMITED ACTIVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY THAT BEING SAID. VERY PRACTICAL THINGS EDT COULD DO ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES ON THE PORTALS IN TEN TO TWELVE WRITTEN LANGUAGES MOST SPOKEN BY ELLIE PIECE OF THE STATE'S ADDITIONAL DEDICATED TELEPHONE LINES IN TEN TO TWELVE LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY ELLIE PIECE OF THE STATE. AND A AND WHAT THE FOCUSED ON SERVING PEOPLE WITH LOW LITERACY AND THAT BELONG TO SMALL REQUESTED GROUPS. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE FEEL THE PDD SHOULD PRIORITIZE EXPANDING ACCESS TO BENEFITS ON THE PHONE LINES ONLINE IS NOT ENOUGH IT MUST BE AUGMENTED BY A ROBUST OF PHONE LINE WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO REACH A LIVE TRAINED STAFF MEMBERS BY PHONE. AND IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME WHO IS EITHER PROFICIENT AND THE COLORS LANGUAGE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS QUALIFIED INTERPRETERS AND SO WE JUST ASK THAT THERE'S A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. FOR THE DIVERSE CITY THAT EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA THESE ARE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT WE HAVE BUT ALSO. BUT THINGS LIKE TRAINERS. SO THEY KNOW. HOW TO USE THAT LANGUAGE LINE AND THEY KNOW WHAT LANGUAGES- OFFERED PROVIDE INTERPRETATION IN REAL TIME WE WILL WE WERE TOLD. THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING BUT WE JUST DON'T SEE IT ON THE GROUND AND WE WOULD ASK THAT THEY JUST BASICALLY ACCEPT. APPLICATIONS IN MORE THAN SPANISH AND ENGLISH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN APPRECIATE I HAVE A MILLION OTHER QUESTIONS BUT OBVIOUSLY I RESPECT THE TIME AND OTHER COLLEAGUES LOOK FOR THE CONTINUE CONVERSATION I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK. ALL THE FRONT LINE WORKERS WHO ARE WORKING ROUND THE CLOCK TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION. WE HAVE TO REFORM THE SYSTEM- AND WE WILL ONLY DO IT IF WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER WITH THAT MANAGER THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN A CHU MISTER LUCKY. YEAH THANK YOU ARE JUST REAL QUICKLY I HAVE A QUESTION FOR DIRECTOR SIGNS THE- THE RECENT STATE AUDIT FOUND THAT BECAUSE OF REDUCE TROUBLING HANDLING OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. ROUGHLY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMANTS MAY NEED TO REPAY SUCH BENEFITS TO THE STATE BECAUSE EIGHTY D. DID NOT PROPERLY ASSESS THE ELIGIBILITY OF SUCH CLAIMS. OVER AN EIGHT WEEK PERIOD ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION CLAIMANTS. MAY HAVE INCORRECTLY RECEIVED FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION IN BENEFITS. I MAY HAVE TO REPAY THE STATE MY QUESTION IS THERE. ANY KIND OF PLAN TO ALLOW FOR REPAYMENT. OF VISA THESE CLAIMS WHEN IT WAS. YOUR NO FAULT OF THESE PEOPLE AND THE CURRENT CONDITIONS IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE IS VERY DIFFICULT I'M SURE MOST OF THOSE. PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN EXPENDED. SO I JUST WONDERED IF THERE WAS ANY PLAN IN PLACE FOR REPAYMENT. EDT IS GOING TO VALUE THE CLAIMANT FIRST. AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SITUATION WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT WE HAVEN'T COME TO A FINAL CONCLUSION AND I PROMISE YOU YOU'LL BE AMONG THE FIRST TO KNOW I WOULD DECIDED TO HANDLES WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOME OF GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE HOPING THAT WE WILL NOW BE ABLE TO HAVE A MORE RESPONSIVE- RELATIONSHIP WITH DEAL WELL WITH ADMINISTRATION. AND OPERATION THIS ISSUE OURSELVES SO I PROMISE YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER JACQUI WILL BE FIRST IN LINE TO FIND OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO LOOK FORTY HEARING THAT THANK YOU. WHAT THANK YOU MR LACKEY WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER NECESSARY IN AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. THE CLOSEST OUT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I'M GONNA HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND THERE'S PROBABLY BEEN A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE COURSE OF THE HEARING SO FIRST OF ALL VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU STEPPING UP TO THIS POSITION DURING THIS CHALLENGING TIME MISSED SIGNS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR TEAM AS WELL- GETTING RIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE QUESTIONS I. ONE OF THE FIRST JUMP INTO. SOMETHING THAT CAME UP DURING A RECENT DVD CALLED SPECIFICALLY ON. JANUARY TWENTY SECOND- DURING A STAFF CALL EDT STATED THAT IT TAKES AN AVERAGE OF EIGHT TO TEN DAYS. AFTER FROZEN CLAIMANT'S IDENTITY IS VERIFIED TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THEIR ACCOUNT. WHY DOES THIS THE LATE EXIST. AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SHORTEN IT HOW MANY CLAIMANTS HAVE EXCEEDED THE TEN DAY MARK. SINCE VERIFICATION WITHOUT PAYMENTS BEING RESUMED. DO WE HAVE ANSWERS TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS AND THIS IS JUST MY FIRST QUESTION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I CAN ANSWER THAT NEED TO VARIAS THAT EDT- SO THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO- WHAT WE SPOKE ABOUT YOU KNOW A FEW MINUTES AGO ON THE- THE STOP PAY THAT WE DID BACK IN IN DECEMBER- AND THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW ONCE ONCE PEOPLE CLEAR ID ME- IT DOES TAKE. YOU KNOW SOME TIME FOR US TO GET THE FILES FROM I. D. ME AND THEN FOR US TO PROCESS THOSE FILES AND TO CHECK FOR CERTIFICATION. THAT PROCESS IS AUTOMATED NOW I MEAN WE SAY ABOUT A WEEK SEVEN TO TEN DAYS OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER THAT THAT THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED BUT- IT IS AUTOMATED NOW- SO. LET'S BE SPECIFIC HERE THOUGH HOW MANY CLAIMANTS HAVE EXCEEDED THE TEN DAY MARK DO WE KNOW. I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. I DON'T KNOW THAT AND YOU GET BACK TO ME ON THE- YEAH ABSOLUTELY THANKS. THANK YOU- AND IF YOU HAVE DATA THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE TO ME BOTH PERCENTAGE AS WELL AS RAW. THAT EXPLAINS HOW MANY. CLAIMANTS HAVE RECEIVED IT RIGHT AWAY OR WITHIN HOW MANY DAYS I'D APPRECIATE THAT AS WELL- TOOK TO NOW THIS QUESTION IS MORE FOR B. OF A WELL AS WELL AS AS WELL AS WELL AS EDT BUT- TO GAUGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FREEZE OF THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMS. HOW MANY VERIFIABLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AMONG THOSE FROZEN. SO I CAN TAKE THAT THAT QUESTION- THIS AGAIN GOES BACK TO THE SPOTS THAT WERE PLACED- AT THE END OF DECEMBER- I BELIEVE THE NUMBER. THAT HAVE COME THE NUMBER THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH IDEA ME. AND HAVE HAD THEIR ID VERIFIED OF THE APPROXIMATELY JUST OVER ONE MILLION HAS BEEN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. ALL OF THOSE THAT- ARE CONSIDERED CONSIDERED FRAUDULENT I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT WAS ABOUT SIX OR 7% THAT HAVE TRIED TO GET THROUGH ID ME HE THAT HAVE FAILED. REST OF THE POPULATION- THERE ARE SOME THAT HAVE OPENED UP THE EMAIL TRIED TO GET ON THE LAKE- BUT I WOULD SAY OVER HALF OF THE POPULATION HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED TO GO THROUGH IT ME. WAS AROUND ABOUT NUMBERS YOU KNOW FROM FROM YESTERDAY BUT BUT THE AND I CAN GET CERTAINLY GIVE YOU THE MOST UPDATED NUMBERS- AT ANYTIME BUT THAT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND LEST CAROL IF YOU KNOW DIFFERENTLY BUT NO THAT'S- THAT'S IT NANCY AND I WOULD SUGGEST OR I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT- AFTER ARE. THE EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME WE- GAVE EVERYONE THE ADDITIONAL TIME TO GO THROUGH IT ME BECAUSE THE WAIT TIMES SO AFTER FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH WE SHOULD START TO REALLY SEE THE MEASURE AND ATTRIBUTE FRAUD. OR UNDUE INTEREST OR LACK OF NEEDING A CLAIM TO A CERTAIN POPULATION VERSUS THE POPULATION THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY GONE THROUGH ITS CERTIFIED- IN THAT WE- WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO. HELP OKAY BUT- THESE NUMBERS WOULD BE CRITICAL IF AGAIN. I CAN GET RAW DATA NOT JUST THE PERCENTAGES. OF AUGUST JUST. I HAD AN THIS BEFORE ABOUT THIS THIS PERCENT BEFORE. AND THAT RIGHT THERE EXPLAINS ALSO. THE CHALLENGES THAT MANY OF THE CLAIMANTS ARE FACING WITH WHEN. IF ONLY 67% SO FAR. YOU'VE SEEN AS FRAUD CASES THAN- THERE ARE MANY MORE INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE STILL WAITING FOR THEIR MONIES TO BE FREED UP- IF I COULD IF I COULD CLEAR FIVE THAT THOSE CATEGORIES SO AS NANCY SAID. THREE HUNDRED SOME THOUSAND HAVE SUCCESSFULLY GONE THROUGH AND- VALIDATED THEIR ID RIGHT BUT THAT'S ALMOST ABOUT. WHAT NANCY IS TALKING ABOUT THEIR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SOME HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED SOMEONE OPEN THE EMAIL- SOMEHOW IN SOME START ANY PROCESS AND THEY COME BACK ATER THERE'S OTHER CATEGORIES WERE PERHAPS THEY'RE IN PROCESS AND THEY'LL FINISH BY FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH PERHAPS THEY'LL ABANDON. SO WE CAN GIVE YOU THE STRATIFICATION WE GET IT EVERY NIGHT- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. TO THE ENEMY GO BACK. THE 67% IS FROM THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. NUMBER ONE MILLION IS FROM BUT WENT OVER ONE BILLION OKAY. JUST TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE GET. NUMBERS AND PERCENTAGES. AND THIS GOES BACK TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO HAD BROUGHT UP WEEK WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THIS DURING THE OF SEPTEMBER AS WELL AS A PREVIOUS HEARING. ON GETTING REGULAR UPDATES- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THESE UP THESE UPDATES ARE BEING PROVIDED ON THE WEBSITE BUT IT'S- CRITICAL THAT WE GET IT OURSELVES. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A CONTINUED OPEN COMMUNICATION AND DIALOGUE I THINK THE COMMUNICATION IS GONNA ADDRESS A LOT OF THESE CHALLENGES- I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THOSE NUMBERS. OF CANDY EDT PUT A NUMBER TO THE AMOUNT OF DOLLAR BENEFITS THAT HAVE GONE UNPAID TO FROZEN CLAIMS SINCE DECEMBER. WELL AS YOU DON'T HAVE THE SENSOR I'D I'D AGAIN I'D LIKE TO GET THIS. ALONG WITH YOUR OTHER. RESPONSES THAT I'LL BE WAITING FOR. CAN YOU CAN YOU ASK THAT QUESTION AGAIN I'M SORRY SURE SURE CAN THE EDB PUT A NUMBER TO THE AMOUNT OF DOLLAR BENEFITS THAT HAVE GONE UNPAID TO FROZEN CLAIMS SINCE DECEMBER. I'M NOT SURE THAT I HAVE THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WE CAN WE CAN GET YOU THAT NUMBER. K. SO HE CAN PER THE FINDINGS OF THE GOVERNOR'S EDT STRIKE TEAM AND THE REPORT THEY RELEASED ON- LAST SEPTEMBER- PAGE SIXTY OF THE STRIKE TEAMS FINAL ASSESSMENT STATES THAT THE EDT HAS CONSISTENTLY MET US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR MANDATES THAT THE RATE OF IMPROPER PAYMENTS AND NOT EXCEED 10% WITH AN IMPROPER PAYMENT RATE OF EIGHT POINT. 2% BETWEEN JULY. OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- HOWEVER THOSE SAME PERFORMANCE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT 87% OF FIRST TIME PAYMENTS BE MADE WITHIN TWENTY ONE DAYS. AND THAT'S A STANDARD THAT THE EDT HAS NEVER MET IT WAS SEVENTY FIVE POINT 6% FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER PERIOD ENDING MARCH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. EDT HAS AN ENTIRE DEPARTMENT AND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES DEVOTED TO PREVENTING FRAUD OR IMPROPER PAYMENTS WHILE NO SUCH DEPARTMENT EXISTS OR- TO PREVENT. UNDERPAYMENT BUT THE MOST URGENT ISSUE FACING OUR CONSTITUENTS IS NOT OVER PAYMENT OF FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. SIX MONTHS FROM NOW YOU CAN INVESTIGATE AND CHARGE SOMEONE WHO DID FRAUD IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. SO WHAT YOU CAN'T RECTIFY IS A FAMILY THAT GETS AND THIS HAS BEEN NOTED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS NOW BY MY COLLEAGUES BUT- WHAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO RECTIFY IS A FAMILY THAT GETS EVICTED THIS WEEK OR A SENIOR THAT CAN AFFORD. MEDICATION RIGHT NOW AND IT'S CETERA. THE ED'S APPROACH TO DATE HAS PRIORITIZED PREVENTING A SMALL HANDFUL OF BAD ACTORS THAT. FROM RECEIVING FUNDS AT THE EXPENSE OF A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER NUMBER OF- LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS. SO THAT SAID. THE STRIKE TEAM ADVICE EDT TOEHOLD UNDERPAYMENT PREVENTION AND HIGHER PRIORITY THAN OVERPAYMENT PREVENTION. WHAT STEPS HAS THE EDT TAKEN TO MEET THIS RECOMMENDATION AND HOW DOES THE SUSPENSION OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMS ADVANCE THIS GOAL. WE WOULD LOVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I DO NOT HAVE THAT ANSWER TODAY. ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL POINTS. I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT- THAT SAID I DO WANT TO ALSO TAKE A MOMENT AND JUST RECOGNIZE THE WONDERFUL WORK OF- A LOT OF YOUR STAFFERS WHO HAVE DONE TREMENDOUS WORK WHILE WE STILL TILL TODAY GET CALLS FROM CONSTITUENTS WHO SAY THAT A EMPLOYEE I. D. D. D. SUGGESTED THAT THEY CALL OUR OFFICE. HAS BEEN ONGOING. I DO ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT MANY OF YOUR STAFF HAVE WORK WORKED EXTREMELY HARD IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HELP SERVE SOME OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE BEEN FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. FOR A MYRIAD OF REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED TODAY WHETHER TECHNOLOGY. OF WEATHER- THE- CONFUSION DUE TO TECHNOLOGY DUE TO NOT ABLE TO GET. THE RIGHT TO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME OR OR MIX THINGS UP- AND OR AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO AGAIN POINTED OUT LANGUAGE BARRIERS. SO I ALSO DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE MR SITE MISS SIGNS. ON YOU IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS PRIORITIZING THE NEED TO GET CLAIMANTS PAID FIRST AND THEN THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF HOW TO GO AFTER THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE COMMITTED FRAUD- I. YOU KNOW I FOUND DATA COMMENTS FROM OUR BANKING PARTNERS VERY INTERESTING- MISTER FOX AND MR MAD. IBM I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT IN ELEVEN YEARS. TEN YEARS. SINCE WE'RE ONLY IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR BY FEW DAYS- THAT WE WOULD HAVE AND COMING FROM ONE OF THE WORST ECONOMIC RECESSIONS CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WHEN YOU GOT YOUR CONTRACT FROM REMEMBERING THIS CORRECTLY. PART OF THE DESIGN OF BRINGING YOU IN. PART OF THE INTENT OF BRINGING YOU END WAS ALSO TO UTILIZE THE CAPABILITY OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR'S ABILITY TO MANEUVER QUICKLY. AN SECURITY SYSTEMS BECAUSE THE BUREAUCRACY AND THE STATE HAS. CAUSED QUITE A BIT OF DEFICIENCIES AND INABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY BUT ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WITH ALL THE PRECAUTIONS YOU TAKE. THERE WAS A BENEFIT OF YOU COMING IN- AND THIS IS WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO WAS TRYING TO POINT OUT TO BECAUSE WHEN HE ASKED A SPECIFIC QUESTION HE WOULD RECEIVE THE SPECIFIC RESPONSE FROM YOU MISTER FOX. BUT THE INTENT OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING WAS THAT YOU SIGNED A CONTRACT THAT WOULD BRING TO THE STATE A SERVICE THAT WOULD OFFER THE BEST PROTECTION INVOLVED IN THAT ELEVEN YEAR PERIOD. AND SO- I DON'T THINK THAT THAT HAS BEEN MET. SUBSTANTIVELY NOR AT A PLACE OR AT A LEVEL THAT HAS OFFERED THE PROTECTION TO. OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT THE STATE WAS LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU WERE BROUGHT IN. AGAIN YOU WERE BROUGHT IN AT A TIME WHEN HE STATE WAS DEALING WITH ONE OF THE WORST ECONOMIC CALAMITIES. SO I EXPECT A LOT BETTER OF A RESPONSE FROM BOTH OF YOU. WHEN A QUESTION IS COMING TO YOU TALKING ABOUT THE VERY ESSENTIAL AREA. OF WHERE YOU ARE AT THE FOREFRONT WHEN YOU DEAL WITH SUCH A SENSITIVE ISSUE OF. INDIVIDUALS BANK ACCOUNTS. YOU ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF SECURITY. AND YOU SHOULD HAVE TREATED YOUR STATE PARTNERS AND ITS CONSTITUENTS WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF. CONCERNED AS YOU WOULD HAVE ADDRESSING YOUR OWN CLIENTS- SO MANY SIGNS YOU YOU HAVE A TALL ORDER AHEAD OF YOU. TO ME THE THREE BIGGEST ISSUES WHETHER IT'S THE OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S THE CHANGE IN CULTURE THAT'S GREATLY NEEDED IN THAT DEPARTMENT. AND ALSO THE CHAIN OF COMMAND WITHIN A BUREAUCRACY. I WHICH WHICH IS PART OF THE CULTURE. BECOMES VERY INHIBITING FROM PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY. VENTURING OUT A LITTLE BIT AND TRYING TO ADD NEW TRIED TO DO NEW THINGS OR BRING ATTENTION. TO CERTAIN LACKING ISSUES I SEE THIS AS BEING A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE NOW FOR. OF AT LEAST SIX YEARS. AND I'VE HAD THE BENEFIT OF SITTING THROUGH THESE COMMITTEES THE COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST COMMUNICATION SO MUCH OF THESE PROBLEMS WILL GET HANDLED QUICKLY. WHEN COMMUNICATION IS N. WHEN WE'RE COMMUNICATING WITH ONE ANOTHER EFFECTIVELY- SO WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW IF- IF THE BANK OF AMERICA REPRESENTATIVES HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON WHAT I'VE JUST POSTED THEM BUT WANT ONE QUESTION SPECIFIC I DO HAVE FOR THEM IS. WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF GETTING CLAIMANTS PAID. ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN CLEARED. I WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROCESS IS AND HOW MANY DAYS IT TAKES. OKAY SO ON AVERAGE FOR YOUR OR YOUR FRIENDS YOUR CLIENTS WHOSECARS BEING FROZEN OR YOU'RE REFERENCING EIGHT EIGHT YOU CLIP IT TO THE PROGRAM. YOU CAN ANSWER BOTH I MEANT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD THEIR ACCOUNT FROZEN BUT YOU CAN ANSWER BOTH BECAUSE I'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW THE DISTINCTION. OKAY SO FOR A NEW CLIMATE. WE MAKE PAYMENT THE MOMENT THE SAME DAY AS WE RECEIVE INSTRUCTION FROM THE EDT THAT MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE CLINTON. SO BOTH THE FILES RECEIVED A TUESDAY. OF THE EIGHT THE OTHER CARDS ARE LOADED ON TUESDAY LATEST WEDNESDAY SO IT'S SAME DAY OR NEXT DAY. FOR CARDS THAT HAVE BEEN- REFER CLAIMANTS WHOSE CARS WERE FROZEN AT THE EDT HAS VERIFIED. THEIR ACCOUNT AND VERIFY THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CLAIM. I BELIEVE AT THIS POINT I FOR THE HE DID THE STATE'S ALSO BEING RUN THROUGH HOW THOMSON REUTERS AS WELL WHICH- IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INSTANT IN FRAUD AND SECURITY ROUTES BROUGHT THAN. ON AVERAGE VIDEO CARD IS A FROZEN THE FOLLOWING DAY. ON EXCEPTIONS. I DON'T KNOW IF I MISSED SOMETHING BUT EIGHT EIGHT SORRY I SO HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE. D. WEISS. AND A NUMBER OF DAYS. SO OR A NEW PERRIN YOU CLAIM IT IS THE SAME DAY OR THE NEXT DAY. FOR AN EXISTING CLIENT BUT WHOSE CARD OR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN FROZEN. AS A RESULT SUSPICION OF BENEFITS LEGIBILITY FRAUD. IF THE EDT KIRKLIN S. PROVIDED WHAT THEY NEED TO THE EDT. AND THE CLAIMANTS LEGIBILITY HAS BEEN VERIFIED. ON AVERAGE THAT CLAIM IT HAS ACCESS TO THE FUNDS ON THE CARD THE FOLLOWING DAY ONE DAY. THERE ARE ALWAYS EXCEPTIONS AS A RESULT THE TYPE OF ROBERT FACING. BUT ON AVERAGE IT IS THE NEXT DAY SHIP WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A BREAKDOWN OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN VERIFIED. AND THEY SHOULD BE RECEIVING THEIR PAYMENT THERE'S NO OUTSTANDING QUESTION THEY'VE BEEN VERIFIED THEY'VE BEEN VETTED EVERYTHING HAS BEEN. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF EXECUTION OF THE CHECK TO BE RECEIVED BY THEM. CAN YOU. PROVIDE NUMBERS TO US TO THE CHAIR AND TO MYSELF AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WHAT WHAT THE BREAKDOWN IS OF HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE THEIR CHECKS OR THEIR PAYMENTS- WITHIN. WHAT PERIOD OF DAYS. IF IT'S A ONE DAY I. START OKAY START OPTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THE- CHECKS ARE SENT DIRECTLY BY THE EDT- TO CLEMENS UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE CHECKS ARE SENT WE ARE NOT INVOLVED WITH THAT PROCESS. BUT BUT TO THE WHEN THE ACCOUNTS ARE UNFROZEN OR WHEN THE ACCOUNTS ARE- MADE HOLE WITH THE SUMS THAT WERE COMMITTED TO I DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK ON A HICK UP OF THE WRONG TERMINOLOGY. SO IN IN THE AREAS THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE FUNDING IS PUT IN PLACE WARM. THE CLAIMANT IS MADE WHOLE I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW MANY DAYS IT TAKES. I THINK THE BEST THING THAT WOULD LOOK AT WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS WE WORK WITH EDTA YEAH WE PROVIDE YOU WITH A RESPONSE. TO YOUR TO YOUR QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT SPANS MORE THAN ONE MEANS OF PAYMENT TO EQUIPMENT. OKAY I WHEN CAN I EXPECT THAT. WHAT WILL HAVE TO DISCUSS THE I'M SURE WE'LL TRY TO PROVIDE RESPONSES TO YOU AT ALL BASED. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISTER MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER NAZARIAN AND THINK THERE'S A SERIES OF QUESTIONS BOTH FOR BANK OF AMERICA N. EDT THAT NEED A LOT OF FOLLOW UP AND WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT AS WELL. I WANT TO BE CONSCIENTIOUS OF TIME THE ROBUST CONVERSATION MUCH NEEDED WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE ARE WAITING ON PUBLIC COMMENT AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR WAITING. UP MR FONG. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF- I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK THEM. TO- A TO THE E. D. TO THE DIRECTOR- YOU KNOW AS YOU CAN HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES AND MYSELF- WE ARE CHANNELING. OUR CONSTITUENTS IS- FRUSTRATION AND ANXIETY I THOUGHT YOU HAD MENTIONED AND- AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I HEARD IT CORRECTLY- IN THIS COURT AND THE STATEMENT WAS MADE BY THE DIRECTOR. OF THE D. THAT YOU THAT YOU HAD SAID THAT THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE EDT. HAVEN'T BEEN REVIEWED IN EIGHTEEN YEARS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT SO I MEAN OF COURSE THIS IS YOUR PREDECESSOR YOUR NEW WITH THE NEW AND NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM. WHY HOW DID THAT HAPPEN HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE YOU KNOW THE RULES YOU KNOW VERSIONS OF AN AGENCY AS IT AS IMPORTANT AS HE D. THAT'S DELIVERING. BENEFITS TO THOSE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS. THAT THERE WAS NO REVIEW OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE OPERATION OF YOUR DEPARTMENT OR LEVEL LET ME GIVE YOU A- LITTLE BACKGROUND WHEN I TOOK OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. WHAT WE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF ALL OF OUR RULES AND REGULATIONS. AND HOW THEY RELATED TO THE FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS. MY EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT IS DATA ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE AWARE OF IS THAT. THE AMOUNT OF STAFF AT LEADING LUXURY WAIT WITH ME OUR UNEMPLOYMENT. SITUATION. YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOME HISTORY WITH THE DEPARTMENT. WHO ARE NOT CAUGHT UP. IN OUR JUDGMENT OUR TRYING TO ACCOMMODATE FOR NEW LAWS NEW RULES NEW REGULATIONS. FOR IS USUAL- I THINK THIS IS WHAT GOVERNMENT PEOPLE ARE SO BUSY DOING WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO NOW. THEY DON'T THE EITHER IT DOESN'T TO THEM OR THEY DON'T CONVERT THE TALK TO DO THAT. WE NEED TO DO THAT. AND IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M GOING TO BE A WORK OF MY STAFF ON AYE. IS A QUESTION THAT I THE REASON THAT I KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN IS BECAUSE I ASKED. HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN. SO THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT I'M TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF. WHETHER ANY OF OUR RULES AND REGULATIONS. ARE INITIATED BY. WE HAD MINISTRATION WORK A LEGISLATURE. NEEDS ARE IN. PART RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE WHAT APPLICANTS HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE- PRIVATE SECTOR GO THROUGH. IN ORDER TO GET. THROUGH THE SYSTEM. SO I THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE EIGHT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A QUICK. REVIEW- I'VE GOT TO DOING. SO I HEAR YOU'RE AND I. S. ON THE HELLO FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE WORKING WITH YOU AS AS YOU CAN HEAR- HONOR AND A REAL TIME BASIS. ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE IN SOME SENSE IF YOU IF FOR THE PUBLIC THAT'S LISTENING THIS IS A REFLECTION OF LEADERSHIP AND THAT PART OF BEING A GOOD LEADER AND A MANAGER OF A DEPARTMENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT TOP OF THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT ANY AGENCY THEIR LEADING IS. IS WORKING. HI AND ON A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL- AND SO I THINK THAT'S A- CLEARED THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR NOW I ALSO SAID I WILL WILL. OF KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PANDEMIC THEY CREATE CHALLENGES. TO THE ORGANIZATION BUT AS WE SEE AS WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER AGENCIES AND DISTANCE TO SOCIETY IN GENERAL THE PANDEMIC ALSO REVEALS STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT EXISTED. AND SEVEN READING THE AUDIT THAT CAME OUT TODAY- COMMITTEE EIGHT PRETTY MUCH BEEN A STATED THAT THE E. D. HAS HASBEEN AWARE OF THE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES AND ISSUES FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS DO YOU DISPUTE OR DOES YOUR BILL FIFTEEN DISPUTE ANY OF THE FINDINGS OF THE OF THE AUDIT. THAT WAS RELEASED TODAY AND ARE YOU PREPARED TO- IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE HIGH. IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING CHAIRWOMAN HAD WANTED TO HOLD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ARCTIC UNTIL THE CAR. UNTIL THE NEXT HEARING THAT'S THAT'S DEL NOT THE CASE THEN I WILL RESPOND. I APOLOGIZE I WILL I STEPPED OUT FOR A HEARING THAT MEETING SO IF THAT'S THE CASE- I CERTAINLY APOLOGIZE- AND I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT THAT ANSWERED THE NEXT HEARING BUT I GUESS MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE ME A BRIEF PREVIEW IN TERMS OF DEAL WITH. THAT WELL. THIS IS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT IN ORDER TO THE CHAIR. I WOULD SAY. BY STIR FONG YOUR QUESTION IS TOTALLY LEGITIMATE THERE WILL BE ANOTHER HEARING I BELIEVE THIS THURSDAY. THAT WILL BE. AS AMERICA NEXT WEEK THAT WILL WRITE DIVE DEEPER INTO THE AUDIT OF TODAY SO THAT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE TO REVIEW. BUT MISS SIGNS YOU ARE WELCOME TO GIVE REMARKS AND IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION POST. OKAY I AM LOOKING FOR EVERY SOURCE OF IMPROVEMENT OF EDT. HELLO ANALYTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS. FROM THE AUDITOR I'M GOING TO TAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE. HELLO TO TAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR STAFF AND PROMOTE CLAIMANTS. WHAT YOU WILL FIND IN ME IS RECEPTIVENESS. AND SO I JUST HAVE TO TWO LAST QUESTIONS THEN AND I WILL- CONCLUDES- IN TERMS OF AND I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER AND- AND I KNOW AND I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED FOR THE D. TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE. OUT IN TERMS OF YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING- I WE HEAR FROM CONSTITUENTS JUST IN IN GENERAL ABOUT. THAT THE FRUSTRATION OF THIS THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN I KNOW IT'S A TENSE SITUATION. EVERYONE IS OVERWORKED AND THERE'S A LOT OF- ANXIETY WHO OVERSEES THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING OF THOSE AT THAT ARE. WORKING AT WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS IS THAT AN INTERNALLY IS THAT DONE. IT IS IT DO OUTSIDE. INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ASSESS HOW DOES THAT WORK. CAROL. THIS IS CAROL WILLIAMS THE OF THE TRAINING IS PROVIDED- INTERNALLY AFTER EATING. OKAY SO THAT'S DONE TO IT THAN INTERNALLY IT'S THE SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DEPARTMENT OR YOU HAVE A INDIVIDUAL CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU SO MUCH YES CORRECT AND- YOU KNOW IT'S- SEVERAL WEEKS. FOR- CERTAIN STAFF IN THIRTEEN WEEKS FOR THE MOST EXPERIENCED STAFF THAT WE NEED HER AND THEN IN TERMS OF- I KNOW THAT IN TERMS OF THE FOR THE CURE OF THE FRAUD THAT WE WORK WE'RE TRYING TO KIND OF GRAPPLE WITH AND THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM I KNOW THAT YOU BROUGHT AND- ADDITIONAL. SCREENING AN ADDITIONAL HELP- AND YOU'VE ALSO OF COURSE MAKE AMERICA IS PROVIDING- SOME FRONT END OF FRAUD DETECTION AS WELL BUT IN TERMS OF YOUR ORGANIZATION% WITHIN THE D. HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN THE FRAUD DEPARTMENT. OR AN ORGANIZATION. THAT COORDINATES AND WORKS WITH WITH WITH THE YOU KNOW UP WITH. WITH THE BANK AMERICA AND THOMSON REUTERS WHOSE COURTNEY THAT HOW MANY PEOPLE ACCORDING. SENATE SO WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NEEDED VARIES WITH EDT- WE HAVE- TWO SEPARATE DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE AN INTEGRITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY DEPARTMENT THAT FALLS UNDER THE U. Y. AND WE ALSO HAVE- INVESTIGATIONS DEPARTMENT- AND SO I'M NOT AND- THE INVESTIGATIONS DEPARTMENT HAS- SEVENTEEN INVESTIGATORS CURRENTLY. THERE ARE- A FEW VACANCIES THERE. AND THEY THEY WORK WITH LET THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO INVESTIGATE- YOU KNOW TOOK THEY WORK WITH THEM TO PROVIDE INFORMATION XIN AND THEY IN INVESTIGATE CLAIMS INTERNALLY IT EDT SEPTEMBER USING CAL O. S. TASK FORCE AND SEVERAL OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO SUPPORTERS ENOUGH WHAT WE'RE DOING. OKAY THE SERVICE I UNDERSTAND SO SEVENTEEN AND INVESTIGATIONS UNIT WITH ASSISTANCE FROM CALLER YES AND THEN HOW MANY WOULD BE IN THE INTEGRITY DEPARTMENT. I AM NOT SURE OF THAT NUMBER WOULD LOVE TO CHECK OUT I WOULD SAY SIX HUNDRED BUT I'D LOVE TO CHECK AND GET BACK TO YOU. SIX HUNDRED. OKAY YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THAT'S THAT'S AN AREA I I'M I'M I'M GOING TO. PRESUME THAT- WILL BE RE EVALUATED AND- AND IN TERMS OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND HELP ITS ROBUSTNESS- IN TERMS OF COORDINATING EVERYTHING- YOU KNOW. AS WE CAN SEE THE EXTENT OF THE FRAUD IS. I MEAN IS A STAGGERING TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND AS AS AS AS I GUESS THAT'S THE NUMBER RIGHT NOW AND CONTINUES TO GROW I GUESS. EACH TIME THERE SEEMS TO BE- MORE ATTENTION TO IT- LET ME JUST END BY SAYING THAT- AS AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER NAZARIAN SAID I DO BELIEVE THAT. IF YOU WANT TO. KIND OF SUMMARIZE I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE THREE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS OR STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. FIRST IS. MANAGEMENT CULTURE. SECONDLY IS PROCESS AND SYSTEMS AND THIRD IS TECHNOLOGY AND- AND OF COURSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF AREAS AND ISSUES WITHIN THOSE THREE- BROAD. AREAS BUT- YUP I THINK TIME'S RUN OUT FOR ALL THE EXCUSES. AND AND ARE CONSTITUENTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE UPSET WERE UPSET AND FRUSTRATED I KNOW YOU ARE UPSET- AND SO- WHAT WE WERE GONNA HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE AND- AND THERE'S AND THE BUCK STOPS WITH YOU GUYS. AND SO I DO APPRECIATE- YOU BEING HERE AND TESTIFYING AND I IN YOUR ANSWERS- PATIENCE IS RUNNING OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND AGAIN- THANK YOU AGAIN TO THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN. WAITING IN THE QUEUE- I DO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL JUST RIP SOME RAPID FIRE QUESTIONS BOTH FOR- D. D. D. AS WELL AS- BANK OF AMERICA. SO I'LL START WITH BANK OF AMERICA AND JUST EXPRESS YOU KNOW BANK OF AMERICA CUSTOMERS GET A TEXT MESSAGE OR AN EMAIL ALERT WHEN THEIR CARD NUMBERS USE WITHOUT A CAR PRESIDENT OR WHEN THEY DETECT SOME KIND OF FRAUD. BUT AND EIGHTY DB OF A CUSTOMER DOES NOT WHY DOES THE TYPICAL V. OF A CUSTOMER GET AN ALERT- IF THEIR CARD IS BEING USED IN ANOTHER STATE OR OVERSEAS. BUT COST BUT EDT CUSTOMERS GET THEIR ACCOUNTS FROZEN FROZEN AT A RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND PER MONTH- THAT ARE BEING UNFROZEN WITH FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TO GO WHAT IS YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS HEARING. THAT THIS WILL BE RESOLVED. WELL WE ARE. THE SINGLE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE DON'T POSSESS. CELL PHONE NUMBERS OR EMAIL ADDRESSES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION. IT'S NOT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CLAIMANTS TO WHOM WE ARE SENDING PREPAID CARDS- OTHER PROGRAMS OF OTHER STATES WHERE WE DO HAVE. CELL CELL PHONE NUMBERS OR EMAIL ADDRESSES AND WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE NOTIFICATIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT'S INCREDIBLY INSIGHTFUL ADVENTURE A SMALL LITTLE FACT THAT CAN MAKE THE TWO HUGE DIFFERENT. AS THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR EDS WHAT IS A COLLABORATION THAT CAN CHANGE FROM THE DEPARTMENT FROM EDT WITH BANK OF AMERICA TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. BASIC CONTACT INFORMATION SO THE BANK OF AMERICA CAN ALERT. UP INDIVIDUALS WHOSE DEBIT CARDS MAY POTENTIALLY BE FROZEN DUE TO FRAUD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER- NEED TO VARIOUS WITH EDT- WE CAN WE WILL WE CAN DEFINITELY WORK WITH BANK OF AMERICA TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I DO KNOW THAT IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE AN EMAIL ADDRESS TO APPLY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS- I AM NOT. SURE ON THE CELL PHONE NUMBER BUT I DO KNOW THAT- YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE AN EMAIL ADDRESS. TO APPLY FOR BENEFITS- BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH BANK OF AMERICA. YOU KNOW SHARE WHATEVER INFORMATION WE DO HAVE THAT IS ALLOWED. THANK YOU- I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN TERMS OF TWO DIFFERENT. THE DEPARTMENT VERSES ANNOUNCED A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO BE ABLE TO AT LEAST COMMUNICATE WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EXPECTING THEIR CARDS TO WORK. I THINK THAT'S POTENTIALLY A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN WORK ON RIGHT AWAY. I'M ADDITIONALLY A. R. MY QUESTION IS- IN REGARDS TO TRAINING BOTH FOR EDT AS WELL AS- A BANK OF AMERICA. MY UNDERSTANDING IS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED ADDITIONAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HIRED AT EDT WHAT IS THIRD WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF THEIR TRAINING AND HOW DO THEY GET TRAINED. SAME QUESTION FOR BANK OF AMERICA I MY IN THE POINT THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE I WANT TO KNOW IF THEY UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE NOT JUST IN A JOB PROCESSING CLAIMS. THIS IS A PANDEMIC THAT IS IMPACTING PEOPLE'S LIVES. HOW IS THAT WORKING. SO FOR ATV WE I THANK JOURNAL EARLY WE HAVE RESUMES TRAINING- THAT MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER WE HAVE HIRED ON APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED ATTRITION THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WE ARE HIRING NOT NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE ADDITIONAL PLOYS FEBRUARY THROUGH APRIL ALL OF THEM CONTRIBUTE TO CLAIM FILING AND RESOLUTION BE MORE ADVANCED FOLKS THERE THE AT BAT BUT CLING COOPER- BUT IT'S- STAY IN TRAINING ABOUT THIRTEEN WEEKS VANCE WORKLOADS AND SUCH AND OUR OFFICE TECHNICIANS TRAIN FOR ABOUT TWO TO THREE WEEKS. JUST ON CLAIM FILING BUT THEY ALSO ARE THE GROUP THAT MAKES THE- OUTBOUND CALLS TO CLAIM ITS REGARDING- THE NEED TO RECERTIFY THEIR CLAIMS EVERY OTHER WEEK SO I HOPE THAT THE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. AND THE OTHER. SO WE'VE WE'VE HIRED SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS ALL ELEMENTS OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT- CONTRACT. WELL WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WE HAVE WE HAVE AN IN DEPTH TRAINING MOCK MODEL FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE DEPENDING ON WHICH ASPECTS OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN. WHAT I CAN ASSURE YOU IS THAT WE HAVE A MODEL WHERE THE MOST EXPERIENCED PEOPLE WE CAN TRACK THEM BY THE TIME OF SERVICE- AND BY TRACKING VIA COMPLEXITY FOR THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THE CASE ADULT. MOST EXPERIENCED PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WERE ASSIGNED THE MOST COMPLEX CASES WHETHER IT'S BROUGHT FIVE MEDICATIONS OR CLAIMS RESOLUTION AND SO WE ARE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT- EXPERIENCED AGENTS AND EXPERIENCE SALAS WITH ONES WERE ASSIGNED TO THE MOST DIFFICULT. ASPECTS OF THE SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN. THANK YOU FOR THAT IN THIS IS A FOLLOW UP AND COMPLETELY COMING FROM A DIFFERENT SPACE BUT- AS I SHARED IN MY OPENING REMARKS. WE HAVE HAD- RESIDENTS OF MY COMMUNITY THAT HAVE FALLS WITH INCREDIBLE ANXIETY ANGST- TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE AND I'M SURE THAT. EDT EMPLOYEES HAVE ALL ALSO HEARD THE SAME ORDER I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YES AMERICAN POLICE HAVE ALSO I HEARD THE SAME. WHAT IS THE TRAINING THAT YOU'RE OFFERING. YOUR WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO. COME FROM A PLACE OF COMPASSION AND KNOWLEDGE. AND ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS AT THAT LEVEL THERE ARE STEP THERE ARE ADDITIONAL STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN AND I'D I'D BE CURIOUS TO KNOW. HOW YOUR PROCESSING THAT KIND OF TRAINING. ALTHOUGH I'LL GO FIRST FROM- BANKAMERICA UP. UP ALL ALL OF OUR- STAFF WHO INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH. CLAIMANTS RECEIVE SPECIFIC TRAINING ON HOW TO IDENTIFY. AND ESCALATE WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED HARDSHIP TYPE OR- SIMILAR CASES INCLUDING CASES YOU JUST REFERENCE YOUR INCLUDING SAUNA AND SPACES THAT YOU JUST REFERENCED. SO- WE DO ACTUALLY TAKE NOTE OF IT AND WE ENSURE THAT PEOPLE RECEIVE TRAINING SO THAT THEY DON'T RESPOND TO. EVERY CALL EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AND WERE ABLE TO- TRY TO FIND RESOLUTION FOR CASES WHERE- ASSEMBLY ASPECTS OF- OUTSIDE THE ISSUES WERE FACING ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE CALL SO WE ARE WORK AND STUFF WE ARE AWARE OF THAT. WATER- FOCUSED ON IT. THANK YOU CAROL WILLIAMS ET DATE. FROM DAY ONE OF TRAINING- OUR FOLKS. ARE NEW HIRES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE FACING FRONT LINE OF E. D. THEIR JOBS ARE DIFFICULT AND MANY ENTERING ALREADY UNDERSTAND THE- DIFFICULT SITUATIONS- CLAIMANTS ARE IN. THAT THEY WILL NOW NEED TO RESPOND TO WE ABSOLUTELY PROVIDE TRAINING IN THE ON THE TERMS OF LISTENING- SB COMPASSIONATE BEING THOUGHTFUL AND THOSE ARE JUST THE BASIC KEY TOOLS THAT. YOU KNOW TEND TO BE ESCALATE BUT TYPICALLY- pHEARD AND THE- AND VALIDATED- AS WE PROCEED TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION BUT THE TRAINING IS ABSOLUTELY PROVIDED AND REFRESHER TRAINING IS SOMETHING THAT I WILL LOOK INTO.
