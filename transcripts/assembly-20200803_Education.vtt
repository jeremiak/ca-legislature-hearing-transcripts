THIS IS MISLEADING THE BILL IS

00:11:00.192 --> 00:11:02.595
SPECIFICALLY. IT SPECIFICALLY

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:03.896
INCORPORATES FOUNDATIONAL

00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:05.631

FRAMEWORK THAT T. PIECE. ON

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:20.546
STUDENT SUCCESS. I AM THE PROUD

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:21.347
FATHER OF THIS BILL BECAUSE OF

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:23.349
MY PERSONAL SEVENTEEN YEARS IN

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:25.317
THE CLASSROOM. NOT ONLY AS AN

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:27.119
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER BUT

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:28.888
AS AN ADMINISTRATOR AND MASTER

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.756
TEACHER WHO MENTORED MANY

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:33.626
TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM. AND

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:36.562
SO MY NUMBER ONE GOAL IS TO

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:37.029

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.802
WE MUST DO BETTER BY OUR

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:45.571
STUDENTS SB SIX ONE FOUR IS

00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:47.506
NEEDED BECAUSE THE CURRENT RICA

00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:49.241
IS FILLING OUR STUDENTS.

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:51.544
PROSPECT PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.779
AND HAS DONE NOTHING TO PREPARE

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.514
THOSE ALREADY IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:57.283
I ACTUALLY TOOK THE RVCA TEST

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:58.617
MANY YEARS AFTER I WAS ALREADY

00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:00.386
IN THE CLASSROOM IT DIDN'T MAKE

THE CDC THOSE FOLKS SHOULD BE

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:56.472
OUT ROUTINE IS. THAT DEMANDING

THAT'S IT WHERE OVER TO THE-

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:10.519
TEACHING ANGELA. CAN TO DEVELOP

THEY USUALLY DO WHEN THEY- GO

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.094
AND TAKE ON ENDEAVOR SUCH AS

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:22.097
THIS. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH

HI CAN I DON'T DID YOU HAVE

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:30.139
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO ADD NOT

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:32.141
THAT I LIKE A CLOSE BUT I.

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:35.945
DON'T. GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.213
RUBIO SO I AND AS I UNDERSTAND

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.048
THIS BILL WELL AS AMENDED THE

01:08:39.114 --> 01:08:40.850
BELIEVE THAT WE CAN PLACE TO

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.685
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AT. AND THIS

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:43.786
IS A GUT AND AMEND WE'RE

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.354
DEALING WITH THIS DIDN'T START

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:45.988
OF THE SENATOR WAS SOMEONE ELSE

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.090
UNTIL RECENTLY. CAN I CLARIFY

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:49.558
AT THIS BILL AND I JUST WANNA

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:50.726
ADDRESS THE POINT THAT A

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:51.927
GENTLEMAN MADE THAT WE SHOULD

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:54.430
BE RUSHING THIS FOR THE-PANDEMIC SO I WANT TO MAKE VERY

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.398
CLEAR THAT THIS BILL. STARTED

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:58.667
LAST YEAR AND A BASED ON THE

01:08:58.734 --> 01:08:59.802
OPPOSITION'S RECOMMENDATION

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:01.170
THEY ASKED ME TO PULL IT

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:02.204
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT LAST YEAR

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:06.408
WAS TOO SOON AND I DID. AND SO

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:06.976
WE'VE BEEN WORKING AN ENTIRE

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:08.477
YEAR WITH OUR A LOT OF TAKE.

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.813
AND KIND ME MY MEETING TO COME

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.981
UP WITH. THAT EVERYONE CAN GET

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:15.551
ON BOARD WITH AND I THINK

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:16.118
THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION WHEN

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:16.719
PEOPLE READ THE BILL BECAUSE I

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:17.319
HEARD THAT WE'VE DWINDLE DOWN

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:18.420
BE EXPECTATIONS TO ONE

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:20.689
PARAGRAPH. THIS IS JUST THE

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:21.757
BILL THAT'S GOING TO DIRECT YOU

01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:22.791
KNOW THE CITY IF YOU TO COME UP

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:25.127
WITH A MORE COMPREHENSIVE-

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:26.896
STANDARDS BUT I DID MEET WITH

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.163
SOME AT THE OPPOSITION THE

01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:29.465
DYSLEXIA COMMUNITY AND I

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:31.400
OFFERED THAT WE WOULD. TRY TO

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:32.902
ENGAGE THEM SO THEY CAN HAVE A

01:09:32.968 --> 01:09:35.104
SEAT AT THE TABLE AS WELL SO I

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:36.605
FOUGHT FOR THAT ALREADY. WELL

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:41.577
THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR BUT I MEAN

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:42.177
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE- SAYS

01:09:42.244 --> 01:09:44.547
WOULD. LEAD MORE THOROUGH. IF

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:45.147
FIVE. THE BILL HAS THE BENEFIT

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:46.081
OF THE POOL LEGISLATIVE. WERE

01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:47.483
IT STARTS YOUR HOUSE RATHER

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.451
THAN. GUTTING AMENDING. A FEW

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:51.687
WEEKS BEFORE WE ADJOURN. I CAN

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:53.389
I WILL JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:54.490
YOU'RE RIGHT BUT IN THIS

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:56.192
PARTICULAR INSTANCE THE STARTED

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:57.526
LAST YEAR AND THAT'S WHY I

01:09:57.593 --> 01:10:02.431
PULLED IT BECAUSE- AGAIN TO

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:02.998
GIVE IT UP A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:03.532
REVIEW AND- MORE. FROM OUR

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:04.033
STAKEHOLDERS SO IT'S NOT

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:04.967
SEVENTY NOW WE JUST CAME UP

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.268
WITH. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:07.736
CAME DURING THE PANDEMIC THIS

01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:09.338
HAS BEEN WORKED ON SINCE LAST

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:10.506
YEAR THAT'S NOT REALLY ECHO THE

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:11.874

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:13.742
REALLY A CODE RELATED BILL WELL

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:14.944
IT IS AND I'LL SHOW YOU A WHITE

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.580
BECAUSE OUT THE GOVERNOR JUST

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:19.648
ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:20.783

POSTPONED FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:24.620
YEARS SO RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:25.988
EVEN HAVE TO TAKE IT. AND SO

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.723
THIS ALLOWS THE TIME DURING THE

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:29.658

CURRENT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING IS

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:40.983
NOT WORKING. AT ALL THAT WE

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:58.433
A LOT OF. HANDS ON ASSESSMENT

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.335
AND MENTORING AND ALL THOSE

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:02.104
THINGS THAT WE TALK ABOUT BUT

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.972
WE NEVER GET AROUND TO DOING.

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.674
AND WE HAVE OVER THE YEARS TAKE

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:07.242
A SHORT CUT OF GIVING PEOPLE A

01:14:07.309 --> 01:14:08.544
TEST. THING IF THEY HAVE THE

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:10.379
KNOWLEDGE. AND I'VE RUN ACROSS

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:12.748
SOME EXTREMELY IT. UP

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:15.350
INTELLIGENT. EDUCATORS WHO ARE

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:16.685
TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE WHEN IT

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:17.653
COMES TO TEACHING KIDS. THEY

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:18.887
COULDN'T THEY HAVE MEMORIZED

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:19.922
EVERYTHING THERE IS THEY KNOW

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.190
ALL THE BOOKS IN THE ALL THE

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:23.058
THEORIES AND WHAT HAVE YOU. BUT

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.660
THE WHOLE IDEA OF HAVING A

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:26.495
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STUDENTS.

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:27.996
AND FIGURING OUT THE THINGS

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:29.198
THAT CAUSES DOOMED TO HAVE

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:30.966
BARRIERS IN CERTAIN AREAS WITH

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:33.202

JUST BEAR. SO AND THE DIFFERENT

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:39.541
CAN SEE BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCE

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:41.710

PLACE. WHICH IS GIVEN SOME

01:15:06.468 --> 01:15:07.436
DIRECTION AND FIVE THAT'S A

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:10.038
