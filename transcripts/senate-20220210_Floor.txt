THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT SR SIXTY A RESOLUTION DECLARING THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY SB SAFETY AWARENESS MONTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN I WAS A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR PART OF MY JOB WAS TO TAKE CARE THE TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF OUR SCHOOL AND I SAW SO MANY NEAR MISSES IN CHILDREN AGES CROSTINI AND PARENTS- SCARE FOR THE LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AS CARS WERE SPEEDING BY. PARENTS AND CHILDREN ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO DODGE THE CARS THAT JUST WON'T STOP IN FRONT OF A SCHOOL ONE YEAR A STUDENT WAS HIT AND KILLED RIGHT OUTSIDE ANOTHER SCHOOL THIS WAS SO TRAUMATIZING ON ME TO THE TEACHERS THE PARENTS BUT TO THE APPARENT IN PARTICULAR WHO WAS DISABLED WHO IS A SINGLE MOTHER AND RELIED ON THAT CHILD FOR SO MANY THINGS OF COURSE SHE NEVER RECOVERED AND HER LIFE WAS ALTERED AND CHANGED. AND TOP. AND I THINK OF THAT MOTHER OFTEN TO. IF ONLY WE CAN EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF DRIVING THE SPEED LIMIT UNFORTUNATELY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN DANGEROUS DRIVING AND SPEEDING OF CARS. ACCORDING TO DATA FROM THE C. H. P. THE NUMBER OF DRIVERS SPEEDING OVER ONE HUNDRED MILES PER HOURS. ON OUR HIGHWAYS NEARLY DOUBLED BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. THAT IS SIGNIFICANT. AND LIVES ARE AT STAKE AND IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES A RECENT STUDY ALSO SHOWED THAT NEARLY 50% OF DRIVERS DROVE. ELEVEN MILES PER HOUR OR HIGHER ABOVE THE SPEED LIMIT AROUND SCHOOL ZONES IN PARTICULAR. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE TODAY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS RESOLUTION. LIVES ARE AT STAKE LIVES ARE ALTERED AND SOMETIMES HAVE DEVASTATING EFFECTS FROM GENERATIONS TO GENERATIONS. THIS IS WHY I INTRODUCED SENATE BILL SEVEN THIRTY FIVE LAST YEAR TO INCREASE THE ENFORCEMENT OF SPEED LIMITS AROUND SCHOOL ZONES. AND THAT IS WHY I AM PRESENTING SR TODAY. S. R.

CENTER RUBIO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE TO PROBABLY PRESENT F. YOU'RE A SIXTY FIVE WHICH PUT PROCLAIMS FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY AS TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH AND THAT IS WHY TODAY I'M ALSO WEARING ORANGE. TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ISSUE THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY CALLS UPON CALIFORNIANS TO OBSERVE THIS MONTH WITH PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES THAT RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE DYNAMIC FIFTEEN DATING VIOLENCE AND PREVENTION. WE MUST TEACH HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP SKILLS THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS THAT ENSURE A POSITIVE AND SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL TEENS THIS ISSUE DOES NOT ONLY AFFECT TEENS BUT EVERYONE THEIR PARENTS THEIR TEACHERS THEIR NEIGHBORS AND OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION. CONTINUES TO BE A CRITICAL INVESTMENT. THE WE SET ACTIVELY ADDRESS WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER TO PREVENT FUTURE VIOLENCE AND SUPPORT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN FORMING HEALTHY AND SAFE RELATIONSHIPS WE ALSO NEED TO CHANGE THE MINDSET. AND START THINKING DIFFERENTLY TO ALL PARENTS AND FAMILIES OUT THERE I ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT ONLY ASK. IS THERE VIOLENCE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP ARE YOU BEING ASSAULTED PUT ARE YOU BEING COERCED AS WE KNOW THAT THAT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT IS THE ABILITY TO TAKE SOMEONE'S FREE WILL. TO FREELY CHOOSE THEIR FRIENDS TAX MESSAGE HANG OUT WITH THEIR FAMILY AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT IS JUST AS BAD AS THE PHYSICAL ABUSE. WE MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT OUR TEAMS ARE NOT IMMERSED IN A TOXIC CULTURE THAT NORMALIZES VIOLENCE OR COERCION BUT INSTEAD WORKS TO UPLIFT THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED VIOLENCE SO THAT THEY MAY HEAL. AND MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT FEAR I WANT TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TWENTY MYSTIC VIOLENCE FOR SPONSORING THIS RESOLUTION AND OF COURSE ALL MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES FOR PART THREE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO MEMBERS DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR MEN PROUD MEMBER OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HI RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. C. R. SIXTY FIVE. RECOGNIZING THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY IS THE TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH. AND I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND I COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FROM BALDWIN PARK FOR OFFERING THIS. WE KNOW THE VIOLENCE AND TEEN DATING IS FAR TOO OFTEN. AND HAPPENS FAR TOO OFTEN IN RECENT STUDY DONE ON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THE CDC FOUND IN THAT IN THE PAST YEAR NEARLY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAD EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL HARM FROM SOME OF THE ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH. OF THIS POPULATION YOUNG GIRLS AND MOST ROLE BOUGHNER BOWL WITH ONE IN THREE GIRLS IN UNITED STATES REPORTING SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL OR VERBAL ABUSE IN A RELATIONSHIP. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE SEVERITY OF TEEN DATING VIOLENCE BECAUSE IT IS THE GATEWAY TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT'S THE GATEWAY TO DEPRESSED INCOME. TO DEPRESSION TO ALL SORTS OF HARMS IN THE FUTURE OF THESE YOUNG WOMEN AND IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE AS A STATE A PROGRESSIVE STATE LEADS CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES FOR SURVIVORS SOUGHT COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MEN CENTRO VOGUE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF S. C. R. SIXTY FIVE TEEN DATING VIOLENCE IS A PROMINENT ISSUE THAT AFFECTS OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS FRIENDS TEACHERS AND COMMUNITIES IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE NOT ONLY SHINE A LIGHT ON THESE ISSUES BUT ALSO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWERS LEGISLATORS TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. CHILDREN WHO ARE SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE OR WITNESS TO VIOLENCE KERRY THOSE EXPERIENCES WITH THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES THE FIRST STEP TO BREAKING THE CYCLE IS TO ENSURE THAT SURVIVORS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE PROVIDED WITH SUPPORT. WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH WORKED TIRELESSLY TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL LIFESAVING SERVICES TO SURVIVORS THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THERE ALSO REMAINS A GREAT NEED FOR PREVENTATIVE EDUCATION AND INCREASING PUBLIC AWARENESS AROUND THE PREVALENCE OF TEEN DATING VIOLENCE WE ALL PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN AMPLIFYING THE VOICES OF SURVIVORS AND PUTTING AN END TO THIS VIOLENCE.
