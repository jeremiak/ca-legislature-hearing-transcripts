THANK YOU SO AT THIS MOMENT I WILL- THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON OVER TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER. SIX FOUR SB THREE EIGHT FOUR. BOB SENATE QUARTERS IT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHENEVER YOU ARE READY. THE THIRTY MILLIMETER HELLO IN A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- ALTHOUGH EXISTING LAW REQUIRES SOCIAL WORKERS IN PROBATION OFFICERS TO EXERCISE DUE DILIGENCE IN THEIR INVESTIGATION IDENTIFY LOCATE AND NOTIFY RELATIVES OF CHILDREN TAKEN IN CUSTODY. CALIFORNIA STILL FALLS FLAT AND PLACING THESE CHILDREN IN THE CARE OF A RELATIVE. OF ALL CHILDREN REMOVED FROM PARENTAL CARE ONLY ABOUT 32% ARE PLACED WITH RELATIVES. RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT RELATIVE PLACEMENT RESULTS IN BETTER EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH WHEN COMPARED TO FOSTER CARE CONCRETE CARE. IN STATE AND FEDERAL LAW EVEN INCLUDE A PREFERENCE FOR REAL TO PLACEMENT. HOWEVER ROLE TO PLACES RELY ON THE EFFORTS MADE BY SOCIAL WORKERS IN PROBATION OFFICERS TO LOCATE AND CONNECT YOUTH WITH THOSE RELATIVES. SB THREE FOUR SIX TO ADDRESS THIS BY REQUIRING COUNTIES TO UTILIZE FAMILY FINDING THEIR EFFORTS TO LOCATE POTENTIAL ROLE TO PLACEMENTS FOR YOUTH. FAMILY FINING IS A POWERFUL TOOL ALREADY AT THE DISPOSAL OF COUNTIES THAT CAN INCLUDE SEARCHING FOR RELATIVES USING A COMPUTER BASED SEARCH ENGINE. USING THE CHILD AS A PRIMARY INFORMATION SOURCE AND CONDUCTING IMMEDIATE IN PERSON INTERVIEWS OF ALL PERSPECTIVE RELATIVE CAREGIVERS. SB THREE FOR THE FAMILY FINE ACT AIMS TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF FAMILY FINDING. BY ADDING FAMILY FINDING TO THE DEFINITION OF DUE DILIGENCE AND RECORDING COUNTY WALTER DEPARTMENTS TO REPORT. IT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IN THE STATE FOSTER CARE HOMES BIRDS PERSON WHAT PRACTICES FOR FAMILY FINING THE COUNTY HAS IMPLEMENTED. STRENGTHENING FAMILY FIGHTING EFFORTS MADE BY COUNTIES WILL RESULT IN MORE CHILDREN BEING PLACED IN A PERMANENT HOME. AND THEREFORE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE THEIR CULTURAL IDENTITY. AND CONNECTIONS TO THEIR COMMUNITY. MAINTAINING BETTER PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN UNDERGOING LAW SCHOOL CHANGES- I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THREE YEARS NOW TO TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO SIGN UP FOR CALIBRATION CALIFORNIA- CALIFORNIA MAKES IT WAY WAY TOO HARD WHICH IS ONE OF WE WHICH IS WHY. WE ARE- ONE OF THE LOWEST STATES IN TERMS OF CALFRESH UP TAKE THE PERCENTAGE OF. ELIGIBLE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE BENEFIT. AND WE ARE DEAD LAST WHEN IT COMES TO SENIORS. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH YOU ACTUALLY SIGN UP IT'S ACTUALLY- THE CITY SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED. BY HOW POORLY WE DOING SIGNING PEOPLE UP FOR COVERAGE AND WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. HI AND THIS BILL WILL. ADDRESS TWO OF THE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO CALIFORNIA'S. PUBLICATIONS ONE IS TO FINALLY MANDATE THAT EVERY SINGLE COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA ALL FIFTY. ALLOW PEOPLE TO SIGN UP FOR CALPERS BY TELEPHONE- AND AGAIN IT'S EMBARRASSING THAT WE NEED A BILL TO TELL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TELL THE COUNTIES. TODAY NEED TO LET PEOPLE SIGN UP BY PHONE IT'S VERY EMBARRASSING THAT WE NEED A BILL TO DO THIS- BUT- A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE COUNTIES DO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE. TO SIGN UP BY PHONE. AND- WE'RE MANDATING THAT THEY DO SO AND SO IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD THING DENISON TAKE A BILL. BUT ALAS HERE WE ARE WITH THE BILL. ON. THE OTHER- TO THE BILL HAS TO WITH THE APP- AND IF EVER SEE THAT CAN. APPLICATION IT IS EIGHTY PAGES LONG BUT THAT ACTUALLY UNDER US. ITS A VERY DENSE. EIGHTEEN PAGES LONG I ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH IT LAST NIGHT ON MY IPAD- AFTER I. DID MY TAXES ON SUNDAY- AND DOING MY TAXES ON SUNDAY WAS MUCH EASIER THAN IF I WERE TO FILL OUT- THOSE EIGHTEEN PAGES AND WE EXPECT FRAIL SENIORS. AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- TO FILL OUT THAT APPLICATION AND IS IT ANY WONDER. THAT WE RANK LAST FIFTY OUT F FIFTY STATES. IN TERMS OF SENIORS WHO ACTUALLY SIGNED UP FOR. A CALPERS TO THE BILL WILL MANDATE A MUCH SHORTER SIMPLIFIED. FORM FOR ANYONE SIXTY AND OLDER LIVING WITH A DISABILITY- AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT SENIORS AND PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES THEY ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY. TO ALREADY BE ON SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENT BENEFIT WHETHER IT BE SOCIAL SECURITY. OR SSI OR OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND SO. WE JUST DON'T NEED TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION. FROM THEM TO BE CLEAR THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY THINGS WE NEED TO DO- BUT THESE ARE TWO SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS THAT WE CAN REMOVE.

WELCOME M. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS IT'S- MY PLEASURE TO PRESENT- SENATE BILL TWO FIFTY EIGHT IT SEEKS TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION IN CALIFORNIA'S. AGENCIES ON AGING BY TARGETING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS TOWARD HIV POSITIVE OLDER ADULTS SPECIFICALLY IT WILL UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S STATED DEFINITION OF GREATER SOCIAL NEED TO INCLUDE CULTURAL OR SOCIAL ISOLATION CAUSED BY HIV STATUS. FOR ME THIS COMBINES TWO PLACES I WAS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES OF ONE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIV EPIDEMIC WHERE ARE WAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A NONPROFIT. THAT DEALT WITH HIV SERVICES LOCALLY AND WHERE WE ONLY HOPED THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIVE TO OLD AGE WITH A CHARGE SHE WASN'T HAPPENING AT THE TIME AND NOW 50% OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE HIV IN CALIFORNIA OR OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD HOPED FOR IS HAPPENING PEOPLE ARE AGING. OUT OF WITH HIV SECONDLY ARE WAS CHAIR FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS OF THE LOCAL AREA AGENCY ON AGING. AND SANTA CRUZ NATURALLY DID THINGS IN THE REVERSE OF EVERYWHERE ELSE BECAUSE EVERYWHERE ELSE THE ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE THE CHAIR AND THE BOARD OF THE AREA AGENCY ON AGING AND THE SENIORS WERE ADVISORY IN SANTA CRUZ THE SENIORS WERE THE ONES THAT WERE IN CHARGE IN THE ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE THE ONES THAT WERE ADVISORY. AND SO I WAS CHAIR OF THE ADVISORY COUNCIL WHICH REALLY ADVISED ON THE DIRECTION OF SERVICES TO SENIORS. IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO ON NOW THIS WOULD ADDRESS. THAT ISSUE OF PRIORITIZING. OF FOR THE GREATEST SOCIAL NEED. OF PEOPLE WITH HIV AND RIGHT NOW WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT AND SERVICES WITH THE AREA AGENCY ON AGING THERE'S A PRIORITY FOR OUT REACH. TO SPECIAL POPULATIONS. NEED OUR EXIST LAW DEFINES GREATNESS SOCIAL NAY. TO MEET THE NEEDS IS BECAUSE BY NO ACTON FACTORS INCLUDING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DISABILITIES THAT MAY BE COSTA RELATED. TO ANY OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS. AND SO THAT WOULD ADD THIS TO THAT CATEGORY AND PRIORITIZE SERVICES SO- IT WOULD. IT WOULD REALLY EASE THE BURDEN OF CONNECTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO SUPPORT OF AGING ERVICES AND PROGRAMS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT OLDER ADULTS WILL AGE IN PLACE WITH DIGNITY AS WE DO FOR MANY POPULATIONS AND MANY CATEGORIES. S. B. TWO FIFTY EIGHT IS SPONSORED BY QUALITY CALIFORNIA THE LOS ANGELES LGBT CENTER STAGE AND IT'S PROJECT LOS ANGELES HELP IT'S WIDELY SUPPORTED. BY MANY ORGANIZATIONS AGING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE NAPA SOLANO AREA AGENCY ON AGING ISN'T SUPPORT HIV ADVOCATES AND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AS WELL AS LGBT GROUPS UP AND DOWN% THE STATE. HURT TODAY ARE TO TESTIFY BRIEFLY IN SUPPORT OR TAMMY MARTIN OF THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA ENTERS ANDERSON OF A GROUP KNOWN AS LET'S KICK **** AIDS I WAS HOPING FOR AN ACRONYM BUT THAT'S WHAT I GOT. SO THOSE ARE THE TWO WITNESSES SAID AND WHEN WE'RE ALL DONE MADAM CHAIR- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE.

WE THANK SENATOR LYRICS FOR CAMPAIGNING THIS BILL WHICH WILL REALLY DEMONSTRATE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT FOR OLDER ADULTS. THE CIVIC WE OLDER PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV- I'VE DESCRIBED BY DESIGNATING THEM AFTER POPULATION OF GREATER SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE TECHNICIAN ENSURES THAT THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. ARE ACTIVELY REACHING OUT TO THE POPULATION SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT SERVICES AND SUPPORT EXIST THE SAME AS THEY DO NOW FOR POPULATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY DESIGNATED. POPPING THEM ALL STAY HEALTHY AND LIVE WITH DIGNITY. AND DATA AND EXPERIENCE SHOW US WHY THIS BILL IS REALLY NEEDED. AND I'VE AUTHORED POINTED OUT OVER 50% OF CALIFORNIANS RIGHT NOW ARE LIVING- OF CALIFORNIANS WERE LIVING WITH HIV ARE AGE FIFTY OR OLDER THANK YOU ADVANCEMENT IN TREATMENT. AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH THE POPULATION FACES BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL AGING THAT REFLECT THEIR LACK OF ACCESS TO SERVICES A FACED PRONOUNCED HOW. NEEDS AND MUCH HIGHER RATES OF DEPRESSION DUE TO STIGMA ISOLATION AND LONELINESS AND GIVEN THAT LIMITED SOCIAL SUPPORT THEY DO OFTEN LOOK TO GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. BUT STILL REPORT BARRIERS AND A LACK OF COMPETENT KERR EVEN IN URBAN AREAS LET ALONE IN SMALLER CITIES AND RURAL AREAS. I THINK YOU GET THE EIGHT CONTINUE THE PROGRESS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MADE TOWARD RECOGNIZING THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AND AIDS IN LINE WITH THE PROGRESS THE LEGISLATURE OVERALL HIS NEED. TO UPDATE THE LAW TO REFLECT SCIENCE AND NOT STIGMA THE COSPONSORED AND OUR EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF COMMUNITY ADVOCATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS.
