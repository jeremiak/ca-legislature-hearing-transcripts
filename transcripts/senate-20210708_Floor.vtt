FORMER SEVENTEEN YEAR TEACHER I

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:15.627
ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:17.796
OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE CRITICAL

00:23:17.863 --> 00:23:19.364
TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR CHILDREN

00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:20.899
WELL FIRST OF ALL I AM SO

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:22.200
PLEASED TO SEE THAT OUR

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:25.470
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT OUR

STUDENTS COME PREPARED. AND

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:28.640
IT'S NOT ONLY FOR THEIR

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:29.741
LEARNING BUT ALSO FOR THEIR

00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:32.077
NUTRITION AND I MANY TIMES HAD

00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:33.612
FOOD IN MY CLASSROOM JUST

00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:34.880
BECAUSE OUR KIDS CAME INTO THE

00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:36.848
CLASSROOM SO HUNGRY AND I KNEW

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:38.316
THAT I HAD TO FEED THEM AND SO

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:39.417
I'M SO PROUD THAT THIS

00:23:39.484 --> 00:23:41.219
LEGISLATURE THAT WE'VE INCLUDED

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:43.789
THAT IN THE BUDGET. AND I ALSO

00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:46.224
WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW I SEE

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:47.592
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:49.027
KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE

00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:51.663
STUDENTS I'VE SEEN SO MANY KIDS

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:52.731
COME AND- YOU KNOW I'M NOT

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:54.132

WHILE THEIR COUNTERPARTS

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.135
ALREADY READING TWO THREE

00:23:57.202 --> 00:23:58.570
READING LEVELS ABOVE THEM AND

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:00.005
SO THIS WILL HELP LEVEL THE

00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:02.040
PLAYING FIELD AND I THINK. THIS

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:03.842
CREEK IMPORTANT ALSO FOR

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:06.311

00:24:06.378 --> 00:24:07.345
HAD SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES

00:24:07.412 --> 00:24:08.880
CALLING INTO SHARING HOW

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:11.950

ALWAYS DID IT WITH A SMILE AND

00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:16.521
ALWAYS WERE PREPARED THEY

00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:17.956
REALLY WERE PLEADING FOR

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:19.858
SUPPORT IN THIS. AREA AND SOME

00:24:19.925 --> 00:24:21.827

00:24:21.893 --> 00:24:23.895
WERE ABLE TO. TO INVEST IN

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:25.831
EARLY CHILD. EDUCATION BECAUSE

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:27.566
IT PREPARES OUR STUDENTS

00:24:27.632 --> 00:24:29.835
BETTER. AND THAT ALSO HELPS OUR

00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:31.102
TEACHERS NOT TO STAR STUDENTS

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:33.505

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:10.128
A BIG HELP AND WITH ALL THAT A

00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:12.630
A BACKDROP. WELL THE THINGS

00:27:12.697 --> 00:27:15.834

COUNTY AND OTHERS THAT HAVE

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:21.439
SPOKEN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:24.642
THE ONE OF THE KEY ONES IS THAT

00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:25.944
THE BUDGET AS PROPOSED IN THE

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:28.747

LOCAL LEVEL THAT WENT INTO DEBT.

00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:42.193
IN FEAR OF PANDEMIC CUTS WE'LL

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.429
HAVE THAT. FOR A REAL A DISH.

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:45.830
AS WAS SAID BY THE BUDGET

00:27:45.897 --> 00:27:50.135
CHAIR. BY THIS SETS FORWARD-

00:27:52.937 --> 00:27:54.639
RUN THE RISK OF FUNDING

00:27:54.706 --> 00:27:56.574
DECLINING ENROLLMENT BECAUSE OF

00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:58.643

THAT IS WORRIED ABOUT A HEALTH

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:10.155
CHALLENGE. VAN THIS GIVES AN

00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:12.323

00:29:09.214 --> 00:29:10.448
MUCH AND IT'S THAT THERE'S

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:11.683

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.921
EXCEPTION FOR ME. AND THAT'S

00:29:16.988 --> 00:29:18.623
THE MORATORIUM ON NINE NINE

CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.028
THAT DURING THIS PANDEMIC.

00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:25.563
THOSE THOSE PROGRAMS IN

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.466
PARTICULAR. WERE LIFESAVERS FOR

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:29.400
SO MANY FAMILIES AND THEIR

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:32.670
KIDS. BECAUSE OF THE EXPERTISE.

00:29:32.737 --> 00:29:33.638
BUT THOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS HAD

00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:35.473
DEVELOPED. IN THOSE TYPES OF

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.878
REMOTE. LEARNING PROGRAMS NOW.

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:40.945
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME RARE

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:43.448
PROBLEMS IN THIS SPACE. WE HAD

PARK IS AS FAR AS WE KNOW- IT'S

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:20.295
A VERY UNUSUAL SITUATION WHERE

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:23.031
A PARK IS SITUATED IN THE

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:24.900
JURISDICTION OF TWO CITIES WHAT

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:26.401
WE DO IS WE LEAVE IT UP TO THE

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.003
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DECIDE

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.905

SEE WHAT YOU CAN HAVE ONE CITY

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:39.448
AGREE IN ONE CITY NOT AGREE AND

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:41.416
THAT BASICALLY LEAVES THE PARK

01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:43.418
RESIDENCE- WITHOUT ANY

POINT AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:01.270
HIGHLY UNLIKELY BUT IN THE

01:14:01.336 --> 01:14:04.239
