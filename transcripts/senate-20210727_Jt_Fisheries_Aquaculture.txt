MORNING LADIES IN GERMAN WE WELCOME YOU TO THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE- WE ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSING THIS MORNING'S HEARING ON CALIFORNIA'S. SALMON FISHERIES WHICH ARE IN CRISIS WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THE HISTORIC DROUGHT LOW FLOWS IN THE ANTICIPATION OF DEAD FISH HERE. IN THE COMING WEEKS WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE JOINED US TODAY WE'D LIKE TO BE A START. TODAY'S HEARING WITH SOME HOUSEKEEPING FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO OUR VICE CHAIR VICE CHAIR STONE FOR.

THAT INDIVIDUAL MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE REMOTE MEDIAN SERVERS OR HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM IN FORTY TWO THREE. OR IN OUR OVERFLOW ROOM IN THAT IS ROOM TWENTY FORTY. BUT AGAIN THAT IS VERY UNLIKELY. I'D LIKE TO BE TO GET INTO SOME OPENING COMMENTS IN AND TURNED OVER. TO OUR FANTASTIC VICE CHAIR VICE CHAIR STONE. WHO IS REPRESENTING THE ASSEMBLY HERE TODAY. LOOK THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER. AT THIS VERY CRITICAL TIME BECAUSE IT'S INCREDIBLY FRAGILE FOR OUR STATE'S ICONIC SALMON WHO ARE ON THE BRINK OF TOTAL COLLAPSE. AND IN SOME WATERSHED HERE IN THE STATE ON THE BRINK OF TOTAL EXTINCTION. SALMON HAVE MIGRATED THE TRADITIONALLY COLD WATERS OF CALIFORNIA STREAMS AND MUDDY RIVERS FOR CENTURIES. THEY'RE INCREDIBLY HARDY SPECIES OVERCOMING GREAT ODDS TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES STREAM THEIR BIRTH PLACE TO LAY THEIR EGGS AND START THE PROCESS OF THAT GREAT ANNUAL MIGRATION OVER AGAIN. NO SALMON OF INVOLVED TO LIVE IN THE RUGGED WEST THEY OF ALL TO A BATTLE RAGING TORRENTS INTO LEAP OVER ROCKSLIDES THEY'VE EVOLVED TO WITHSTAND WILDFIRES. THEIR LEGACY LEGALLY HELP BUILD THE GOLDEN STATE. THE CARCASSES OF SPAWNING ADULT SALMON CREATED TO NOURISH THE SOILS OF OUR UPSWINGS IN OUR MOUNTAINS THE GREAT SALMON MIGRATION ITS STORIED. IN IT WAS ONCE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TRANSFER OF ENERGY NUTRIENTS FROM THE SEA TO THE LAND IN OUR GEOLOGIC HISTORY. SALMON ALSO HELP BUILD OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES ADDING TREMENDOUS VALUE TO OUR COASTAL ENDING A CONNIE'S THROUGH COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE AND RECREATIONAL ENJOYMENT. THE NEAREST PEOPLE HERE SINCE PEOPLE STARTED TAKING STEPS IN WHAT IS NOW BECOME CALIFORNIA. TODAY THOUGH THE SAME SALMON BEHIND THEY HANG ON BY A THREAD. WE'RE WITNESSING THE COLLAPSE OF THIS ICONIC SPECIES. RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES. NOW THE OVER FUND OF THIS COMMITTEE SERVICE TO ENSURE THAT THE OFFICIALS ENTRUSTED WITH OUR PUBLIC TRUST. FISHERY AND AQUACULTURE RESOURCES DO SO TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY IN COMPLIANCE WITH SCIENCE AND THE LAW. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE THIS IMPORTANT WORK. BUT NEVER IN OUR NEARLY FIFTY YEAR EXISTENCE. HAS THIS COMMITTEE CONTINUED WITH SUCH A DIRE SITUATION. A DIRE SITUATION. THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE TODAY. CALIFORNIA'S HISTORIC DROUGHT. FOR MAKING HOLD COMMUNITIES UNLIVABLE. AND WHILE THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT HAVE SHOWN GREAT AND RESILIENCE AND RESOLVE IN THE FACE OF DROUGHT. I THINK WE WORRY AS WELL ABOUT THE SALMON OR WHETHER SHE WATERSHEDS THAT BREED LIFE IN WEALTH HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR SURE YEARS AGO THE VICE CHAIR AND I HELD A HEARING CALLED WHERE OF ALL THE SALMON GONE. WE HEARD ABOUT THE PERILOUS STATE OF SALMON FISHERY AFTER THE LAST DROP AFTER THE LAST PERIOD A FEDERALLY DECLARED FISHERIES DISASTERS. AFTER THE DANGEROUS GAMBLE THE RUN THE WATER SYSTEM AND CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE LIMIT. A REPORT RELEASED AT THAT TIME BY CALTRANS. CONCLUDED THAT FIFTY TWO PERCENT. 52% OF THE SALMON SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE WIPED OUT WITHIN FIFTY YEARS IF SERIOUS MEASURES. AREN'T TAKEN TO HELP SAM. FOUR YEARS AGO WE KNEW THAT 81% OF CALIFORNIA'S REMAINING SALMON. STEELHEAD AND TROUT WERE SHOWING SIGNS OF SIGNIFICANT DECLINE. THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT REPORT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF IT WERE UPDATED TODAY. THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH WORSE IT'S BECOME FOR FISH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. ANY THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH BETTER OFF WE WILL BE IT FOR YEARS A RELATIVE WATER WEALTH WERE USED TO. BUILD RESILIENCE INTO OUR RIVER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM INSTEAD OF MOVING FORWARD WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S WATER STORAGE POLICY. THIS YEAR WE ARE HEARING FROM OUR OWN DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THAT WE COULD SEE A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. I 1100% DIE OFF OF WINTER RUN BABY SALMON. KILLED OFF IN THE SACRAMENTO. WITHIN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER WATERSHED. AND JUST BEING HONEST BOUT IT THIS IS A LEGACY OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP FEDERAL WATER YOUR WATER POLICIES SHIFTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SHIFTED TO PUSH WATER THAT WAS ONCE STORED BEHIND CALIFORNIA'S RESERVOIRS TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH LITTLE TO NO REGARD. FOR CALIFORNIA'S ICONIC SALMON FISHERY THE ADMINISTRATION IGNORED ITS OWN BIOLOGISTS THEY IGNORED SCIENTISTS IN THE DUMP THE NEEDED COLD WATER THAT WAS STORED IN GOLDEN STATE LAKES. THAT HELP BALANCE INDEED OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS ALONG WITH THE NEED OF OUR ENVIRONMENT IN FISH. AND EVEN THOUGH PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NO LONGER IN OFFICE CALIFORNIA AND CANDIDLY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS MAINTAINED THIS ABYSMAL POLICY. EARLIER AT LAST YEAR FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SERRA SUE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FOR VIOLATING THE DINING ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IN ENACTING THE WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN IT SEEMS CLEARLY DESIGNED TO FACILITATE EXTINCTION. ALLOWING THREE YEARS. ONLY THREE YEARS A TOTAL SALMON DEATH BEFORE REMEDIAL ACTION IS TAKEN. INDEED THIS STATE SAT IDLY BY RUBBER STAMPING WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS PROMULGATED UNDER THE VERY PLAN THAT THE STATE IS LITIGATING. IT'S IS OUTRAGEOUS THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND NOW BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ACTION AND THIS DROUGHT. IT'S LIKELY GOING TO BE THE DEATH KNELL OF WINTER RUN CHINOOK IN CALIFORNIA. LOOK I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE DROUGHT IS INCREDIBLY TRAGIC EIGHT CREATES INCREDIBLE HARDSHIP IN THE SCIENCE IS TELLING US THAT WE COULD BE IN IT FOR A LONG TIME AND WE HAVE TO DO BETTER AND THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO BE A TO BRING THIS FIFTY YEAR COMMITTEE TOGETHER TODAY TODAY WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FOM OUR AGENCY LEADERS ABOUT THIS VERY TOPIC. IN MORE. WELL HERE A HE CRUCIAL UPDATE ABOUT THE PROGRESS TOWARDS DAM REMOVAL ON THE KLAMATH. THE SILVER LINING COMES AS A RIVER FACES SOME OF THE MOST. TERRIBLE CONDITIONS EVER IN HISTORY. CONDITION SO BAD IN THE KLAMATH AT NEARLY. EVERY FISH IS INFECTED WITH HEAT LOVING PERICYTES. SO HOT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE TO REST. TOO RISKY TO LET A SINGLE BABY FISH SWIM DOWNSTREAM FROM THE IRON GATE HATCHERY. WE'RE ALSO GOING HERE FOR SOME. THAT WERE IN HERE ABOUT SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE OR WILL BE MADE TO CURTAIL WATER USE. IN DELIVERIES ON THE SCOTT AND SHASTA REVERSED ALONG WITH IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED. OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL AS IT ALWAYS IS TO HEAR FROM EACH OF YOU THE PUBLIC AND HEAR FROM OUR ALL STAR PANEL. OF DISTINGUISHED PANELISTS BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THE REMARKS I'D LIKE TO TURN THE COMMITTEE OVER. TO OUR VICE CHAIR VICE CHAIR STONE WE WELCOME USER AND- PROVIDE THE FLOOR FOR OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ON THE CENTRAL COAST WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS ON AND PROTECTING PRESERVING THE ANADROMOUS SALMONID CENTER THERE AND WE'VE SEEN FOR CERTAIN SPECIES THAT EXTINCTION LINE MOVED FURTHER AND FURTHER NORTH SO A LOT OF EFFORT HAS BEEN DONE ON VERY TO THE SMALL COASTAL WATERSHEDS TO TRY AND MITIGATE THE LOSS OF THE SELMON IT'S AN IN MANAGE HABITAT IN THE SMARTER AND BETTER WAY. NOW WE'RE SEEING THIS ON A GRAND SCALE REALLY ACROSS THE SIERRA. CAN UP THE SACRAMENTO RIVER WHERE CLEARLY FAILED. WATER POLICY ESPECIALLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HAS. COME TOGETHER WITH THE DROUGHT AND OTHER EFFECTS TO PROVIDE SOME REALLY DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON THE SALMONIDS IN IN CALIFORNIA SO EVEN AS CLIMATE IS SHIFTING AND WE'RE HAVING TO DO A BETTER JOB OF MANAGING WATERSHEDS AND RETHINK HOW WATER MOVES THROUGH THE SYSTEM TO PROTECT THE FISH AS WELL AS PROVIDE WATER FOR HUMAN USE AND FOR AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATELY. THESE ARE DECISIONS THAT WERE BEING WORKED ON IN BEING MADE AND THAT WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY DEVASTATING CIRCUMSTANCES COME TOGETHER INCLUDING MISMANAGEMENT OF FEDERAL POLICY. TO REALLY DRIVE. FISHERIES POTENTIALLY TO EXTINCTION WHICH IS REALLY FRIGHTENING TO SEE. AND SO A LOT OF THE STEPS THAT WE'VE MADE OVER THE YEARS ARE NOW BEING ANNOUNCED BY THIS POLICY AND THEN NOT SURE REALLY WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO. BUT IT'S A CRISIS NOW AND IT'S GOING TO BE A CRISIS CONTINUING INTO THE FUTURE WHETHER OR NOT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DROUGHT JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE WITH THE WATER SHOULD HAVE BEEN MANAGED AND ABUSED AND MISUSED THE DAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE. BUT FORTUNATELY NOW ON THE KLAMATH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING OUT BUT MANAGING UPSTREAM. TO THE WATERSHEDS WERE THE SOURCE OF THE WATER IS WHAT WE'VE TRADITIONALLY HAD COLD WATER COMING DOWN. AND IN APPROPRIATE VOLUMES COMING DOWN TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE FISHERIES THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO. LOOK TO THE FUTURE TO GET BACK TO YOU SO THAT WE CAN HELP A FISH THAT HAS BEEN RESILIENT AND COMING UP AGAINST THE POINT OF NO LONGER BEING ABLE TO MANAGE THE- THE CHANGES THAT ARE MOSTLY MAN MADE THAT OR ARE COMING DOWN TO THE SAMANIDS. SO I DON'T THINK THESE REPORTS ARE GOING TO BE. HI VERY OPTIMISTIC I'M AFRAID BUT I'M ALSO LOOKING FOR. OUR EXPERTS TO HELP US FIGURE OUT WHAT STEPS NEED TO BE TAKEN AT THE AGENCY LEVEL. OR AT OUR POLICY LEVEL IN ORDER TO DO THE BEST WE CAN DO TO INVEST IN WATERSHEDS FOR OUR FUTURE AND AGAIN THAT'S FOR. INVESTING IN HUMANS BUT IT'S ALSO INVESTING IN THE CELL MINUS THE WILDLIFE FISHERIES THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO PROTECT. SO THIS IS NOT HEARING I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO BUT I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING SOME GOOD ADVICE AND- FIGURE OUT HOW WE CHART THE PATH FORWARD SO THANK YOU MR. VENTURA SINCERELY MEANNESS MISTER VICE CHAIR IS ONE OF THE LEADING ADVOCATES IN THE STATE ON ALL ISSUES OF WATERSHED RESTORATION FOCUSING ON FISHERIES SURVIVAL AND REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP CERTAIN COULD YOU SEE. ALL RIGHT LAYS IN GERMAN MONOGAMY MOVING ON TO OUR FIRST PANEL OUR FIRST PANEL IS GOING TO BE COMPRISED OF TWO SALMON WATER POLICY VETERANS AND WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THEY COULD JOIN US TODAY WERE FIRST GOING TO HEAR FROM CHUCK BONHAM CHUCK BONHAM IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO BE ABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIRECTOR WHO'S MOVED WITH SPEED TO BE ABLE TO SAVE RUNS OF SALMON HERE ESPECIALLY HATCHER ON SALMON- AT THROUGH HIS ROLE AS A DIRECTOR EFFICIENT WILDLIFE. HE IS GOING TO BE TALKING TO US ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO CONSERVE SALMON INCLUDING THE DIRE SITUATION FACING HER OUR FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON IN THE DEVASTATED WHEN AROUND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HEAR FROM HIM ABOUT CENTRAL VALLEY WATER POLICIES GOING TO TALK TO US ABOUT. THE AGENCY'S HATCHERY PROGRAMS ITS ROLE IN MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS CLIMATE DAM REMOVAL AND OTHER ITEMS IMPORTANT AT FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO RECEIVE AN UPDATE ON SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LADIES IN GERMAN HE'S GONNA BEJOINING US. VIRTUALLY WE WELCOME AT DIRECTOR BONHAM HERE TO COMMITTEE MISTER DIRECTOR YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING TIME IN YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR AND WE'LL HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL WE HEAR FROM. ME SO BACK WHOSE EXACTED RECTOR AFTER THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. MISTER DIRECTOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU SENATOR LET MR JUST CA. THAT YOU CAN BOTH HERE AND SEE ME WELL. YOU'RE COMING IN LOUD AND CLEAR AND I'M TAKING THOSE CLASSES. MY SIDE IS GOD WORSE WITH THE SO MUCH OF OUR WORK LIFE ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN COMMITTEE. HEY IT'S TRUE MY NAME IS CHUCK BONHAM I AM STILL THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE THANK YOU VICE YOURS BROWN. ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR TO TRIBAL CHAIRS THAT ARE JOINING TODAY SURE JAMES INSURER OTHER VERY- MY DEPARTMENT'S PARTNERSHIP WITH THOSE TWO TRIBES AS SOVEREIGNS IN THE KLAMATH BASIN IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY AND CO MANAGEMENT WITH THESE TRIBES IS OUR FUTURE. ON JULY SIXTEENTH YOU ASKED ME TO COVER SPECIFIC TOPICS TODAY. I'D LIKE TO WALK THROUGH THAT LIST AND LET ME BEGIN WITH AN OVERALL STATUS. BUT BEFORE I JUST WANNA KNOW MY ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL LIFE HAS BEEN AND- COMMITTED TO SALMON CONSERVATION IN THE WEST. IN MY CURRENT JOB IN MY PRIOR ROLES FOR TROUT UNLIMITED THE NATION'S OLDEST AND LARGEST SALMON AND TROUT CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION. ACTUALLY CHOSE MY LAW SCHOOL BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE CURRICULA INCLUDED SALMON LAW. SO THESE ARE TOPICS THAT VICE CHAIR ARE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH SUCH BLEAKNESS. BUT THESE FISH PROVE US IF WE GIVE A CHANCE TO THEM BILL SURVIVED THEIR HEARTY AND THEY'RE RESILIENT. IS THE OVERALL PICTURE IF YOU TAKE THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. WHAT YOU'LL SEE AND TWENTY YEARS OF PRETTY GRANULAR DATA WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE IS A GENERAL STATE OF DECLINE FOR SAM FISHER. YOU LOOK BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND YOU GO TO TWENTY TWENTY AND YOU CAN PLOT OUT IN BAR CHARTS. I'M UP AND DOWN SOME YEARS THE POPULATIONS HEADING UP SOME YEARS IT'S HEADING DOWN. BUT GENERALLY OVER THOSE TWENTY YEARS IT'S ON A LONG TRAJECTORY DOWNWARD. AND ACROSS THE TWENTY YEARS AGAIN IS JUST A SNAPSHOT THERE'S AN EARLIER RECORD IN TOWN. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE YEARS OF TWO THOUSAND SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE IS THE CHAIR MENTIONED THOSE WERE PARTICULARLY. STRONG FIGURES FOR THE SALMON FISHER WE HAD A TWO THOUSAND SIX AND SALMON-CRASH. IT GREATLY AFFECTED OUR COASTAL COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. AND WHAT YOU SEE IN THE DATA BEGINNING OF A REBOUND. BETTER YEARS ACTUALLY END UP TECH OF COURSE THAT REBOUND RAN STRAIGHT INTO OUR LAST ROW WHICH WAS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. INCLUDING FOR WHEN A RUN IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. AND THEN AS YOU COME OUT OF THAT DROUGHT YOU SEE A POPULATION DECLINE AGAIN IN THE DATA SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN. WHICH YOU ACTUALLY SEE AS WE GET INTO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TWENTY UP. AND IN FACT I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT. A LOT OF THE RETURNS TO OUR RIVERS THIS YEAR ARE HIGHER. THAN EXPECTED. BUT OF COURSE THIS REBOUND HAS RUN INTO THE CURRENT DROUGHT. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN MESSAGES I WOULD ONE UNDERSCORE WHAT WORRIES ME GREATLY. IS OUR SPECIES PARTICULARLY AQUATIC DEPENDENT TRASH BUT THERE ARE TERRESTRIAL AQUATIC SPECIES. ARE LOSING THE ABILITY TO RECOVER THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY ABILITY IN CALIFORNIA. WITH OUR HYDRO GRASS BUT ALSO OUR SPECIES HAD SPACE TO RECOVER AND REBUILD. AND WHAT I THINK MAY BE OCCURRING IS THAT SPACE FOR RECOVERY TO REBALANCE IS REALLY BEING DRAMATICALLY ALTER. AND THIS IS WHERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BUT- THE BROADER CONTEXT IN PLAY. DON'T FORGET WHAT WE ARE LIVING FOR. THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO CALIFORNIA SOME ARE SUGGESTING WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MEGA DROUGHT WE NEVER LAST LEFT THE LAST ROUTE. SOME HAVE SAID THE CURRENT PERIOD OF DRYNESS IN THE WEST. MAY EVENTUALLY RIVAL THE DRYNESS OF THE INFAMOUS SMALL. DROUGHT RIGHT NOW IS AFFECTING 96% OF SEVEN WESTERN STATES ARIZONA CALIFORNIA IDAHO MONTANA NEVADA OREGON WASHINGTON THAT'S THE HIGHEST EVER COMBINED PERCENT SINCE THEY'VE BEEN KEEPING THAT METRIC. LAKE MEAD AND THE COLORADO RIVER SYSTEM WHICH IS THE NATION'S LARGEST RESERVOIR IS JUST 35% OF CAPACITY WHICH IS THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE IT WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE. WE ALL IN EARLY JULY JUST LIVED THROUGH A SHE BLOOMED ACROSS THE ENTIRE WEST. WHICH EXPERTS THIS EXCEEDED THE STANDARD METHODS OF EVALUATION. AND ALLOW PORTLAND WAS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN DEGREES AND IN THAT SAME SPACE DEATH VALLEY IT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY AGAIN WHICH IS ARGUABLY THE HOTTEST TEMPERATURE EVER RECORDED ON THE PLANT. SURE YOU'VE LIVED THERE WHILE FAR MUCH MORE PERSONALLY AND DRAMATICALLY THEN BE. AS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR. WE FOUGHT FOR FIVE OF OUR BIGGEST WILDFIRES AT THE SAME TIME TO DO THIS YEAR WE'VE ALREADY HAD MORE WILDFIRES THAN LAST YEAR. SO THE STATISTIC THAT MOSTLY HAS ALTERED MY OWN MENTAL CAPACITY TO THINK ABOUT THE SITUATION RANDY. IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO A DIFFERENT VARIABLE. THE DRYNESS OF OUR STORE. WE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE SOMETHING WHICH I THINK IT'S ACTIVELY WAS OUR SNOWPACK VANISHING. OVER THE MONTHS OF APRIL AND MAY. WE WENT INTO APRIL ONE OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR LOOKING AT THE DATA ACCUMULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES NEBRASKA AGING NETWORK. THAT MOMENT THE SNOW PACK IN THE SIERRA WAS WHAT THEY CALL 59% OF OUR- BY MAY ONE IT WAS 22% OF AVERAGE. BY JUNE WANTED WAS ZERO. ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET IN THAT TIME FRAME WHICH IS N. AS PAUL ROGERS WROTE IN THE MERCURY NEWS AT THE END OF JUNE MORE THAN 40% OF THE WATER THAT LOS ANGELES CITY USES IN A YEAR. OF THAT IT WENT INTO THE STORE THE STORE WAS SO DRY IT NEVER MADE IT INTO OUR MAIN RESERVOIRS. I THINK. HAVING LIVED AND WORKED IN THE LAST ROW. WHAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW IN THIS EXPERIENCE. IS THE ROOT HEAD ET AT WHICH THESE EXTREME EVENTS ARE COMPOUNDING. CREATING CASCADING AFFECTS A DOMINO EFFECT WERE ONE EVENTS DRYNESS IS CONTRIBUTING TO ANOTHER HE WHICH IS CONTRIBUTING TO ANOTHER DROUGHT. WHICH THE ROLL UP OF ALL ARE PRODUCING THE INABILITY TO SPACE FOR OUR NATURAL SPECIES TO USE THEIR RESILIENCY AND REBEL. SO HERE'S WHAT I THINK WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IN OUR DEPARTMENT ACROSS WATER SHIFTS SUMMARIZE DOWN OIL DOWN LAND LANGUAGE. WE SEE LOW WATER FLOWS IN OUR RIVER AND ARE CREATES. THOSE LOW FLOWS IN TURN TRIGGER WARMER WATER TEMPERATURES. THOSE WARMER WATER TEMPERATURES INCREASED DISTRESS THEY ALSO AMPLIFIED THE RISK AND PREVALENCE OF PATHOGENS AND DISEASE SPREAD. THEY CONTRIBUTE TO ELEVATED LEVELS OF JUVENILE SALMON MORTALITY. THEY ARE CAUSING ADULT RESPOND MORTALITY RATES THAT ARE UNUSUAL. AND THIS IS LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO INSTREAM AG LOS. SO WE LEARN FROM ALL ASTRO. CURRENTLY OBSERVING IMPACTS BUT THE REALITY IS A FULL IMPACTS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE REALLY WON'T BE REALIZED FOR ANOTHER TWO OR THREE YEARS BECAUSE YOU KNOW TESE FISH HAVE ABOUT A THREE YEAR LIFECYCLE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO TOUCH ON FISHING FOR JUST A MOMENT WHICH IS ANOTHER. PART OF OUR DEPARTMENT'S CORE CONSTITUENCY. GENERALLY SPEAKING OCEAN SALMON FISHERIES BOTH SPORT AND COMMERCIAL. OUR CONTINUING IS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL MANAGEMENT COUNCIL THE PS AND MISSY BUT AS YOU KNOW THOSE SEASONS ARE SHORTENED MORE IN SOME PLACES ARE NONEXISTENT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ALREADY LOW ABUNDANCE FORECAST FOR KLAMATH RIVER FALL RUN CHINOOK. SO AS AN EXAMPLE BASICALLY NORTH OF FORT BRAGG IN WHAT'S CALLED THE KLAMATH MANAGEMENT'S ON THERE WILL BE NO COMMERCIAL FISHING ALLOWED IN TWENTY THREE ONE. WHAT'S UNIQUE AND I ASK EVERYONE TO REMEMBER IS WITHIN THE MIDDLE OF THIS WEEK MASS. THERE ARE ALSO MOMENTS OF BRIGHTER. NEWS OR BETTER OUTLOOKS EVEN THOUGH THERE IS RESTRICTED COMMERCIAL OR RECREATIONAL FISHING. WHAT WE'RE ALSO SEEING HAPPEN RIGHT NOW IS FOR THOSE FISHERIES THAT ARE OPEN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CATCHES ARE AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THE PRE SEASON PROJECTIONS SO FAR. AND IN FACT WE HAVE AN UNUSUALLY HIGH PROJECTION. FOR RETURNS OF WINTER RUN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER AND THAT'S PLAYING AL AS WE'RE MAKING IN THE FIELD OBSERVATIONS LOOKING AT. I ALSO THINK THERE ARE OTHER BRIGHTER MOMENTS. TO UNDERSCORE HERE WE LEARNED A LOT FROM LAST ROW. DO IN THE LEGISLATURE INVESTED IN OUR DEPARTMENT WE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS COMING OUT OF THE LAST ROW. TO IMPROVE OUR HATCHERY INFRASTRUCTURE DEAL WITH PASSAGE AT THE JUNE RISKS WITHIN OUR OWN FACILITIES REFURBISH AND MODERNIZE OUR TRUCKING FLEETS. WE WILL LEARN WHAT WATERSHED IN THE STATE MAY TURN WORST. THIS MONITORING IN COLLABORATION WITH ALMOST EVERY INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATION IN YOUR PANELS TODAY. SO AS WE WENT INTO THIS DROUGHT I THINK WE HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER POSITION. HAVE MOVED MUCHFASTER FOR BETTER RESULTS AND IN FACT YOUR STAFF SUMMARY. FOR THIS COMMITTEE MEETING SAYS QUOTE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS AN IMPORTANT DROUGHT RESPONSES ARE TAKING PLACE HERE ARE SOME OF THOSE BEGIN WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP CENTER VICE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATURE. WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREDIBLE INFUSION. OF MONEY INTO MY DEPARTMENT ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS EMERGENCY FUNDS RIGHT NOW TO SUPPORT FIFTY FIVE POSITIONS TO ENGAGE RAPIDLY DEALING WITH THIS DROUGHT. NINE MILLION OF THAT WILL SUPPORT TWENTY SIX POSITIONS SPECIFICALLY FOR FISH RESCUE AND STRESSOR MONITOR. ALMOST ANOTHER TEN MILLION OF THAT IS FOR ADDITIONAL HATCHERY IMPROVEMENTS PURCHASING STATE OF THE ART TANKER TRUCKS THIS RESCUE UNITS UV SYSTEMS. ANOTHER TWO MILLION OF THAT IS SPECIFICALLY FOR DROUGHT RELATED PERMITTING TO GET RESTORATION ANOTHER WATER MANAGEMENT ACTIONS DONE FASTER. ALMOST EIGHT MILLION IS SPECIFICALLY FOR DEALING WITH MODIFYING INSTREAM FLOW REQUIREMENTS SEEING AS FARMERS AND RANCHERS WERE FOR BEAR THEIR WATER USE SO WE CAN INCREASE STREAMFLOW. ALL KINDS OF MINUTES ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY. MY COLLEAGUES AT THE STATE WATER BOARD HAVE MOVED FASTER. WE ARE IN A SPACE TODAY THAT WE WERE NOT IN LAST DROUGHT AND IT CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED. OUR STATE WATER BOARD IS ACTIVELY PURSUING EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. AND CURTAILMENTS OF WATER. THAT'S HIS STORE THAT'S CHALLENGING IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S COMPLICATED A CONTROVERSY. MY DEPARTMENT IS AS WE SPEAK WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE WATER BOARD TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM INSTREAM FLOWS FOR SALMON AND MANY OTHER WATERSHEDS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED TODAY. WE SUBMITTED FORMAL LETTERS TO THE WATER BOARD REQUESTING A LONG TERM SOLUTION FLOWS ON THE SCOTT AND SHASTA RIVER IN THE KLAMATH BASIN. THE WATER BOARD IS LOOKING AT HER TALENTS FOR WATER USERS AND THE UPPER RUSSIAN RIVER SYSTEM. SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA. THINGS THAT DID NOT OCCUR IN ALASKA. LET ME TURN QUICKLY TO A COUPLE OF THE SPECIFIC RIVERS AND THEN GET OUT OF THE WAY. THE KLAMATH RIVER. IS ONE OF THE PLACES THAT I CARE ABOUT THE MOST ON THE ENTIRE PLANET. NOW WE'VE HAD SOME DIFFICULT DYNAMICS IN THE MOST RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS. WE ARE EXPERIENCING A VERY HIGH CONCENTRATION OF A TWO KILLER FISH DISEASE THAT WE COLLOQUIALLY SHORTHAND S. C. SHASTA. IT RESULTS IN HIGHER THAN AVERAGE RATES OF DISEASE. AND IT TRANSLATES INTO INCREASED JUVENILE FISH KILLS. WE HAD A DIFFICULT SEVERAL WEEKS WORKING WITH THE RIVER VALLEY TRIED. AND THE CREW TRIED TO YOUR ROCK TRIED COMMERCIAL FISHING AND OUR FEDERAL AGENCY COUNTERPARTS BUT MADE THE DIFFERENCE THE HARD DECISION TO EVACUATE OUR HIGH TREE ON THE KLAMATH RIVER FROM THE FISH WE WERE RAISING. AND MOVE THEM OVER TO OUR FACILITY ON THE TRINITY RIVER. HOLD THEM THERE WHILE WE HOPE FOR BETTER RIVER CONDITIONS IN THE KLAMATH FALLS TAKE THEM BACK AND IT'S- IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. YES WE HAVE LOW FLOWS BUT WE ALSO HAVE RUN INTO. YET AGAIN THE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGE AROUND THE REDUCED VOLUME OF WATER IN CALIFORNIA'S RESERVOIRS LATE TO COLD WATER POOLS. WE ARE SEEING. IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER WINTER RUN RETURN OF SALMON WHICH IS GREATER THAN PREDICTED THAT'S GOOD NEWS BUT THERE IS ALSO WAY HIGHER THAN HISTORICAL RESPOND MORTALITY OF FEMALES HONORS. AND LET ME CLARIFY SOMETHING WHERE I DISAGREE WITH YOUR STOCK MODELS NUMBER NEED TO CONCLUDE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS WE'LL COME BACK FOR QUESTIONS PLEASE DESTRUCTOR PRISONERS DID YOUR STAFF ANALYSIS THAT IS SHOCKINGLY THIS YEAR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. HAS DETERMINED THAT A CHINOOK SALMON JUVENILES ARE LIKELY. TO PERISH IN THE RIVER YOU TO EXCESSIVE TO THAT'S NOT ACT. FIRST ALL WHAT WE HAVE SAID AT THE STAFF LEVEL WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE SOURCE OF THE REPORTING. IS WE ARE MORE LIKELY. TO HAVE. AN EARLIER LOSS OF ABILITY TO PROVIDE COOL WATER. AND THAT SUBSEQUENTLY IT IS POSSIBLE. THAT NEARLY ALL OF THE AND RIVER JUVENILES WILL NOT SURVIVE THIS. WE HAVE SAID THE COLD WATER WILL PROBLEM IS LIKELY TO BECOME WORSE. WHICH CREATES THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT MORTALITY OF THAT WE HAVE NOT COME OUT AND SAID. THAT THERE IS A 1100% GUARANTEED CHANCE ALL OF THESE FISH WILL BE LOST. IT'S A GRIM SITUATION BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ACCURATE- THIS SAME DYNAMIC IS OCCURRING ACROSS COASTAL RIVERS RUSSIAN RIVER IS A GREAT EXAMPLE WHERE THE RIVER LEVELS. ARE AS LOW AS THEY HAVE EVER BEEN INCLUDING BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. SO WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE STATE. ONE CAN LEAVE THIS CONVERSATION DEPRESSED DEJECTED- FOR DESPAIR. IT KEPT ME UP LAST NIGHT THINKING ABOUT TODAY IT KEEPS ME UP MOST NIGHTS. BUT I ALSO THINK WITHIN THIS PICTURE IS THE ABILITY FOR US. TO SAVE THE SITUATION TO ENSURE THESE FISH PASS ON TO FUTURE GENERATIONS LET ME IN THERE AND I'LL WAIT FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISTER DIRECTOR WE'RE GONNA BE COMING BACK FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS BUT WERE GRATEFUL FOR THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE TURNING OVER TO EILEEN SO BACK. MR BACK IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AS SHE CAN BE MAKING HER FIRST APPEARANCE AS A PANELIST BEFORE THE COMMITTEE WE WELCOME HER AS WELL AS THE STATE BOARD AND MISSILE BLANK WILL BE PROVIDING AN UPDATE ON THE STATE WATER BOARDS REGULATORY ACTIONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THIS COTTON SHASTA WATERSHEDS IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER SYSTEM WITH A FOCUS ON HOW THOSE ACTIONS WILL IMPACT OUR CRITICAL SALMON FISHERIES I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT- MADAM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TO IGNORE ALL OF YOUR CHAIR CHAIR ASK ABOUT MR ASK ABOUT HAS MADE HIMSELF READILY AVAILABLE TO THOSE IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED ESPECIALLY UPPER RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED. AT TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST IN THIS DIRE TIME- AND I DID NOT WANT IT TO PASS A SEDATE WITHOUT SEEKING HIM FOR HIS DIRECT INVOLVEMENT INSISTING COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS TO GET THROUGH THIS THAT CHALLENGE THAT IS CURRENTLY FACING US. MADAM EXACT ADDRESS OR THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. AND WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISS CHAIR AND- MISTER VICE CHAIR. CAN YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME ALRIGHT YOU'RE COMING IN LOUD AND CLEAR PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. YOUR WARM WELCOME AND FOR YOUR INVITATION AND I WILL PASS ALONG YOUR REGARDS TO CHAIR ESCOBAL. HE SENDS HIS. REGRETS THAT HE AND I HAVE HAD MANY. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THESE THESE TOPICS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND SO I. I HOPE I CAN. FIND REFLECTING HIS HIS VIEWS ON MANY OF THESE ISSUES AS WELL AS THE REST AS WELL AS THE REST OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS. I'M AND I WANT TO THINK. DIRECTOR BONHAM FOR HIS REMARKS- I THINK ONE THING THAT IS HAS BEEN REMARKABLE AND DURING THIS DIFFICULT PERIOD IS THAT. ON THE STATE. AGENCIES INCLUDING- OUR TWO AGENCIES OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY CALLS WE'VE ALL BEEN ON ALONG WITH- DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES THE RESOURCES AGENCY OVERALL- ANOTHER OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE- WE ARE NOT MAKING ANY OF THESE DECISIONS IN A VACUUM WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO. LEVERAGE ALL OF OUR RESOURCES- AND OUR STATUTORY AND LET'S JUST LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ALONG WITH THE- OF. THE DOLLARS- APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY FOR DROUGHT FOR OUR PROGRAMS GENERALLY TO GIVE WHAT WE HOPE IS THAT. THE MOST ROBUST AND RESPONSE TO THIS DROUGHT THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN. SO I DO WANNA- ONCE THE MOST MY TIME ELABORATING ON WHAT WHAT THE STATE WATER BOARD IS WORKING ON WHAT EMERGENCY ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING- THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE WE HOPE SOME- BENEFICIAL EFFECTS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON ON OUR FISH SPECIES- WE ARE TAKING AS A DIRECTOR BONHAM AND MENTIONED- UNPRECEDENTED REGULATORY STEP STEPS- AND ALSO WORKING IN LOOKING FOR CREATIVE I'M VOLUNTARY SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WORK MORE FACED WITH- INSTRUCTABLE. I'M NOTED IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA IT'S THE ENTIRE WEST- THAT IS- IS BEING RAPIDLY DEVELOPING EXTREME HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER WATERSHED WE'RE NOW IN THE THIRD DRIEST YEAR IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE WATER YEAR WAS THE SECOND DRIEST TWO YEAR PERIOD ON ON RECORD AND WE'RE EXPERIENCING THE DRIEST CONDITIONS SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN- IN ADDITION- HAS ALSO NOTED BY DIRECTOR BOND AND- THIS SPRING THE SACRAMENTO SOUTHERN AMERICAN RIVER WATERSHEDS. WHICH FEED THE MAJOR- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RESERVOIRS AN EXPERIENCED AN ACCELERATED RATE OF SNOW MELT AND ON AN UNPRECEDENTED- OUR MOTION BY SOILS AND RATHER THAN FILLING. RESERVOIRS AND AS PREDICTED SO THESE AND OTHER FACTORS REDUCED WATER SUPPLIES FOR TWO MAJOR- STATE AND FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS BY NEAR NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET WHICH IS ENOUGH WATER TO SUPPLY MORE THAN ONE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS FOR A YEAR. SO THIS WAS A- DRAMATIC. PASSED CHANGES IN ANTICIPATED- CONDITIONS- AND AS YOU'VE NOTICED- ARE AT S. AS OTHERS HAD NOTICED NOTED- IN THE KLAMATH BASIN- INCLUDING THE SCOTT SHASTA RIVER- TRIBUTARIES AND WATERSHEDS. WHERE THE RIVERS AND SURFACE WATERS ARE CRITICAL SOURCES OF WATER FOR. ECONOMIC ECOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL PURPOSES OF PRECIPITATION LEVELS ARE HALF OF NORMAL ACROSS MUCH OF THAT BASIN THE SCOTT IS EXPERIENCING ONE OF THE FOUR DRIEST YEARS ON RECORD WITH FLOWS IN THE LOWEST THE SHASTA THE CURRENT WATER YEAR IS THE DRIEST ON RECORD FOR THE RIVER. WHICH IS WITH FLOWS IN THE LOWEST 1% OF HISTORICAL RECORDS. THE RUSSIAN RIVER ANOTHER CRITICAL WATERSHED THAT IT HAS EXPERIENCED THE LOWS PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS AND ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS- LEADING TO THE LOWEST- STORAGE LEVEL EVER EXPERIENCED FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR LAKE MENDOCINO AND LIKE CINEMA- WHICH PROVIDES CRITICAL SUPPLIES OF DRINKING WATER FOR OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND FLOWS FOR THREATENED AND ENDANGERED FISH. LAKE MENDOCINO WAS AT RISK FOR DRAINING COMPLETELY BY THE END OF THE YEAR- IS THE CURRENT DRY CONDITIONS- PERSIST WITHOUT ACTION TAKEN BY. THE WATER. SO I THINK THAT SUMMER SHOWS THAT WE'RE FACING SUBSTANTIAL WATER SUPPLY AND ECOSYSTEM CHALLENGES. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT THAT SUCH CONDITIONS CAN RESULT IN DEGRADED WATER QUALITY SETBACKS TO BUMP BONOBO AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION TO SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON TRIBAL COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL SALMON FISHERIES AND DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TODAY TO THE ECOSYSTEM. SO IN RESPONSE TO THESE CONDITIONS. IN APRIL- GOVERNOR NEWSOM DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN MENDOCINO AND SONOMA COUNTY COUNTIES DUE TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED. AND SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ENABLE- IMMEDIATE ACTION TO INCREASE THE STATE'S DROUGHT RESILIENCE AND TO PREPARE FOR. CURRENT AND CONTINUE DROUGHT CONDITIONS THE GOVERNOR SUBSEQUENTLY EXPANDED THIS PROCLAMATION TO INCLUDE THE KLAMATH RIVER SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA AND TULARE LAKE WATERSHEDS AND IN JULY THE GOVERNOR ADDED NINE COUNTIES TO THE PROCLAMATION WHICH NOW COVERS. FIFTY TO FIFTY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. IN THOSE IN THOSE PROCLAMATIONS OF THE GOVERNOR TASKED. UNDER BOARD DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES DEPARTMENT FISHING WILDLIFE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO WORK WITH REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT- INCLUDING GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES AND CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. TO COORDINATE ACTIONS AND BETTER RESPOND TO OUR PEOPLE NATURAL RESOURCES IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO GOING INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL IN THE ACTIONS THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD. IS HAS OR IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING WHICH YOUR INSIGHT DESIGNED IN PART. TO ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON FISH- WE STARTED- BY ISSUING EARLY. WARNING NOTICES AND MARCH TO APPROXIMATELY FORTY THOUSAND WATER RIGHT HOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE URGING THEM TO PLAN FOR POTENTIAL SHORTAGES- BY REDUCING WATER USE IN ADOPTING PRACTICAL CONSERVATION MEASURES. THEN IN JUNE WE ALSO SENT NOTICES ON THE BALLOT UNAVAILABILITY TO WATER RIGHT HOLDERS IN THE DELTA THE RUSSIAN RIVER AND THE SCOTT RIVER WATERSHED. IN RECENT MONTHS THE BOARD HAS HELD PUBLIC DRUG WORKSHOPS ON VARIOUS TOPICS INCLUDING WATER DEMAND DATA WATER SUPPLY VISUALIZATION TOOLS WATER UNAVAILABILITY UNAVAILABILITY METHODOLOGY AND PROPOSED AMERICAN EMERGENCY CURTAILMENT REGULATIONS. LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THOSE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THOSE ACTIONS- IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OR IMPLEMENTATION- IN THE FIRST- ADDRESSED. THE CRISIS ON THE RUSSIAN RIVER OF THE STATE WATER BOARD ADOPTED AN EMERGENCY REGULATION IN JUNE. WHICH AUTHORIZES THE BOARD TO CURTAIL WATER RIGHT DIVERSIONS IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED. THIS STORY WILL SAFEGUARD STORMWATER WHEN CERTAIN THRESHOLDS- IN THE RESERVOIRS ARE REACHED. THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO PROTECT DRINKING WATER AND FISHERIES. ON THE BOARD ALSO APPROVED A TEMPORARY URGENCY CHANGE- TO MODIFY REQUIREMENTS FOR FISHERIES AND IN LIKE. LIKE MENDOCINO LAKE- CINEMA TO PROTECT THE STORM WATER LEVELS. WE IN THE BAY DELTA WATERSHED WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION- AND ALL OF OUR SISTER AGENCIES TO PROTECT- THIS MUCH WATER STORAGE IN OUR CRITICAL RESERVOIRS AS POSSIBLE AND COLD WATER SUPPLY IN SHASTA RESERVOIR. THE BOARD ALSO ISSUED A TEMPORARY ABOUT RELAXATION OF WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STATE AND FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS- AN EXPEDITED- CONSTRUCTION ADDRESS SALINITY INTRUSION BARRIER IN THE DELTA TO HELP THEM MAINTAIN A STRING STORAGE LEVELS SALINITY CONTROL. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY JUST THIS PAST- FRIDAY THE BOARD ISSUED THE DRAFT- EMERGENCY CURTAILMENT REGULATIONS- FOR THAT THEY DON'T TO WATERSHED- AN ADDITIONAL WATER NOTICES OF WATER UNAVAILABILITY OF THOSE DROPPED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ARE NOW OPEN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PUBLIC WORKSHOP THIS AFTERNOON. AND THOSE REGULATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR ADOPTION BY THE BY THE BOARD ON AUGUST THIRD. WITH REGARD TO THE KLAMATH WATERSHED IN THE SCOTT SHASTA. THE STATE WATER BOARD IS ON OUR STAFF HAS HELD A PUBLIC MEETING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND TO SOLICIT INPUT ON POTENTIAL. DROUGHT VOLUNTARY AND REGULATORY OPTIONS THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN SCOTT SHASTA WATERSHEDS AND AN INFORMAL DRAFT EMERGENCY REGULATION WHICH INCORPORATES THE MINIMUM FLOW REQUIREMENT RECOMMENDED BY- INEFFICIENT AND WILDLIFE AS NOTED BY DR BONHAM- THAT WAS RELEASED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON JULY SIXTEENTH- IN THE COMING PERIOD- JUST CLOSE THIS PAST FRIDAY. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE BOARD WILL ACT ON TIME AND CONSIDER THESE EMERGENCY MEASURES EMERGENCY REGULATIONS SOMETIME IN AUGUST AND THEN LASTLY AND ALL THREE OF THESE EMERGENCY- CURTAILMENT REGULATIONS EITHER BEING ADOPTED OR CONSIDERED- HAS STRICTER BONTA NOTED- OUR OUR PRESIDENTIAL AND THEY WERE ACTIONS THAT WERE NOT TAKEN DURING THE LAST DROUGHT. AND WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE AS QUICKLY AS OUR EMERGENCY PROCEDURES I'M ALLOW WELL ALSO AND TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE TIME FOR- FOR. PUBLIC INPUT- BECAUSE WE DON'T TAKE THESE ACTIONS LATELY CURTAILING- AND- THE GOAL WATER RATES WITH THAT WOULD OTHERWISE IN TOWN FOR ENTITLED PARTIES TO DIVERT AND USE- USE THEIR WATER RIGHTS IS HIS- A DIFFICULT DECISION TO MAKE- AND- WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE IN MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS. ANOTHER ELEMENT OF OUR EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IS THAT WE'RE REQUIRING WATER USERS TO REPORT ON THE PAST AND FUTURE AND TO FORECAST THEIR FUTURE WATER USE- THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION GAP THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO FILL HERE WHICH WILL ALLOW- ALLOW US TO IMPROVE OUR PREDICTIONS AND TO MANAGE- SUPPLIES THROUGHOUT THE ON GOING DROUGHT. ON SHOULD IT- CONTINUES NOT JUST THROUGH THIS YEAR BUT IN TWO YEARS BEYOND. TWO MINUTES- THE BOARD'S ADOPTION OF THESE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ARE MEANT TO SAFEGUARD THE DRINKING WATER FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE. SUPPLY FOR OVER THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF YOUR GET IT FARM FARMLAND. AND TO. PROTECT AGAINST THE LOSS OF STORAGE AND SUPPLY THAT THREATENS SALMON SPECIES AND CRITICAL ECOSYSTEMS. I'M LOOKING FORWARD. WE DO RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR EVEN EARLIER PLANNING AND ACTION ON BETTER TOOLS AND INFORMATION WE'VE ALSO RECEIVED ON TIME FUNDING IN IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR. IMPROVING OUR COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT AND USE OF- WATER RIGHTS DATA WE ALL NEED TO I'M- TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ARE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE USE IN MAKING PREDICTIONS TO REGARDING MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN- CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH. TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT DROUGHT SITUATIONS I'M IN THE RAPID CHANGES IN HYDROLOGY THAT WE ARE FACING BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE AT THE BOARD ARE OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS AND WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND THE BEST VOLUNTARY AND REGULATORY OPTIONS AVAILABLE. TO PROTECT FISH AND THEIR HABITAT ANOTHER CRITICAL BENEFICIAL USES OF WATER AND I WILL STOP THEIR STELLAR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE'RE GRATEFUL HERE WITH US TODAY WHAT WE LIKE TO DO FOR THE DIRECTOR OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THE EXECUTOR IS ACTIVE DIRECTED STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO BE ABLE TO OPEN UP. FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TODAY TO SEE IF THE VICE CHAIR. HAS ANY ITEMS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO ADVANCE OUR- I WOULD DIRECT BOTTOM LINE LIKE TO EXPLORE THAT COMMENT THAT YOU MADE ABOUT THE JUVENILE FISH IN THE SACRAMENTO. AND THE- CERTAINTY WHETHER OR NOT THAT THERE YOU ARE EXPECTING A DIE OFTEN IN YOUR SAID THE YOU DISAGREE WITH STATUS RCOMMENDATION BUT CLEARLY. GIVEN LOW FLOWS AND LOW FLOWS AND SLOWER FLOWS DEFINITELY MEAN WARMER WATER WHICH ARE DANGEROUS TO THE JUVENILE CENTER THERE WILL WHAT IS. I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION AND SIR. WHAT IS WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING. TO SEE WHAT'S MOST LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN THIS RIVER SYSTEM. THEN WITH THE THIS RUN OF CHINOOK AND GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY ARECURRENTLY FINDING WITH SUCH LOW FLOWS IN THE- THE SITUATION IN THE RIVER. THANK YOU VICE CHAIRMAN AGAIN. FOR THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE I REFERRED TO AND THE STAFF ANALYSIS. WAS THE ASSERTION THAT OUR DEPARTMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT A 100% OF THESE PARTICULAR SALMON JUVENILES ARE LIKELY TO PERISH. YEAH I DID AND I'M I'M NOT QUIBBLING THE DIFFERENCES HERE BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE WHAT YOU THINK WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT FEELS IS THE MOST LIKELY. SCENARIO AND I'M I'M I'M ANSWERING I REALIZE I'M A SLOW TALKER. AND I THINK THAT REFERENCE BY STAFF IS TO OUR TECHNICAL STAFF- HAVING CONCLUDED. IN AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET WHICH IS A DATABASE SHARED AMONGST ALL THE MANAGERS. THAT WHAT IS SLIGHTLY. IS R. ONE. AN EARLIER LOSS OF THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE COOL WATER SO WE THINK THAT'S LIKELY. AND THAT EARLIER LOSS OF YOU KNOW MANAGING COOL WATER MAKES IT POSSIBLE. WE MAY FACE- WELL YOU KNOW I'M- NEARLY ALL OF LOS SO IT'S NOT AN EVENTUALITY IT'S A POSSIBILITY. FOR SEVERAL MONTHS IN PUBLIC FORUM WE'VE ALSO BEEN NOTING. THAT THE STATISTICAL MODELING WE ARE RUNNING WITH OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS IT- NATIONAL REVIEW FISHERIES SERVICE SOUTHWEST SCIENCE CENTER. IS PREDICTING. THE POTENTIAL FOR AN 80% PLUS WHAT'S CALLED TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT MORTALITY LOSS SO VICE CHAIR I'M NOT TELLING YOU WE'RE SAYING IT'S A 100% LOS IT'S GUARANTEED IT'S A 100% LOSS I THINK WE'RE IN THE SPACE OF A VERY SIGNIFICANT SUBSTANTIAL LOSS TO RISK. AND IT RELATES TO THIS DYNAMIC AROUND LOW FLOW TEMPERATURE IN COLD WATER. ALSO SAY THAT WE HEARD FRAMING EARLIER AND I'VE SEEN IT REPORTED ELSEWHERE. THAT THIS IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY MANAGEMENT POLICIES ADOPTED BY THE LAST FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. THE CHAIRMAN MENTIONED IN HIS REMARKS THAT DAN ATTORNEY GENERAL BECERRA DID TO. THE PRIOR FEDERAL MINISTRATION THINK IT'S IMPORTANT OF CALIFORNIA SUED GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S ADMINISTRATION THROUGH ITS- MARMARA PROTECTION AGENCY AND ITS NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY OUR LEAD AGAINST. CATALYTIC ISSUE WAS BROUGHT IN PART BECAUSE OF OUR JUDGMENT OF THE SALMON PROTECTIONS IN THE FEDERAL APPROACH WERE INSUFFICIENT. ALSO REMIND FOLKS THAT I THINK YES. LAST WEEK MAYBE TEN DAYS AGO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID TELL THE FEDERAL COURT QUOTE. RECLAMATION WHICH IS THE NEAREST OF RECLAMATION QUOTE HAS COMMITTED TO RE INITIATE CONSULTATION UNDER THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. ON THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS BY OCTOBER ONE. OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH WILL RESULT IN NEW OR AMENDED BIOLOGICAL. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER DIRECTOR MISTER DIRECTOR I JUST HAVE A FEW ITEMS IN IN LOOK I DON'T WANT TO TILT AT WINDMILLS ON THIS BUT- BACK IN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WE HAD- THE LAST DROUGHT- AND NINETY FIVE PERCENT. OF WINTER RUN SALMON- DIED ON THE SACRAMENTO. IN IN YOUR OWN DEPARTMENT AND AGAIN I THINK WELL. MAYBE I WAS STATE MORE- BOLDLY AT THIS POINT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE STILL LOOKING AT WANTING TO BE A TO CONFIRM THE NUMBERS TO YOUR OWN DEPARTMENT TOLD SEEN IN LAST WEEK THAT THERE AND QUOTE AND- THERE COULD BE A NEAR CUP COMPLETE CALL COMPLETE LOSS OF THE YOUNG ENDANGERED SPECIES OF SALMON BECAUSE TEMPERATURES ABOVE A HUNDRED DEGREES. FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. ARE OVERHEATING THE RIVER MAKING IT UNINHABITABLE FOR THE FISH TO GROW BEYOND THE EGG STAGE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE CONFIRMED TO CNN. SO LOOK WE CAN. ADD TO IT HAVE THE NASCENT MACHINATIONS HERE TODAY BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. IN A DROUGHT THAT WAS NOT AS SEVERE AS WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW WE HAD A 95% DIE OFF. AND I GET THAT. MAYBE WE DON'T WANT TO CONFIRM THAT NOW. BUT THE FEDS ARE THE SAME THERE'S GOING TO BE AN 80% WE KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BE WORSE YOUR OWN DEPARTMENT IS SAYING IT IS GOING TO BE A NEAR COMPLETE LOSS- AND- IT IS. IN PART AS YOU SAID CLIMATE CHANGE BUT IT'S ALSO IN PART THAT WE STILL HAVE THE HOLDOVER. WATER POLICY FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHERE WE HAVE LITERALLY PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL. RELEASE OUR COLD WATER STORAGE. RIGHT DOWN TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND NOW WE ARE IN A WORSE WATER. CONDITION YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WE WERE IN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. IN THE SUPPLY SIMPLY IS NOT THERE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE JUVENILE SALMON. FOR FROM DYING OFF AND THAT'S JUST NOT I SEEN THAT THAT'S- ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE FOCUSING ON FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE AND THAT'S A COLD WATER POOL IN LAKE SHASTA SIMPLY ISN'T GOING TO BE THERE THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THAT FEDERAL POLICY. I THAT AGAIN HAS THE FEDS. THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IT'S CARRIED OVER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY AND PUT THE PEDAL TO METAL TO GET THAT. WATER DOWN TO THE CENTER VALLEY RATHER THAN FINDING THAT BALANCE BETWEEN FISHERIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS FARMERS AND RANCHERS. SO MISTER MISTER DIRECTOR LET YOU COMMENT ON THAT BUT I THINK WE MAY BE SAYING THE SAME THING IN AB I. HAVE MY SKI A LITTLE FOR YOURS AT THIS POINT BUT- UNDERSTAND. THAT THERE IS NO WAY THAT THIS YEAR ISN'T GOING TO BE WORSE THAN IT WAS IN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WE SIGNED 95% DIE OFF. IT LOOKS CENTER I AGREE WITH YOU ON. MANY RESPECTS. AND I DON'T MEAN TO ARGUE. THESE SEEMINGLY BIZARRE NUANCES. I PERSONALLY IN OUR DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN HITTING THE BALL HERE. WE THINK THIS IS A SUPER SERIOUS AND BLEAK SITUATION FOR SALMON ACROSS THE STATE. IN PARTICULAR IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER RELATIVE TO WIN OR RUN. ALSO FALL RUN. WE'VE BEEN OPEN ABOUT THAT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. IN MANY PUBLIC VENUES AND WE'RE LOOKING AT PRETTY SIGNIFICANT RISK OF LOSS IN THIS DYNAMIC OF THOSE FINISHES LIFECYCLE- WHETHER IT'S 80% 90% R. PERCENT. ANY OF THOSE PERCENTS ARE SIGNIFICANT FOR THESE FISH IN PART. BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD THAT FULL OPPORTUNITY TO REBOUND AS I WAS DISCUSSING IN MY OPENING REMARKS SO I'M WORRIED. I THINK WE HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATION ON THE AMERICAN RIVER I THINK WE HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATION ON THE KLAMATH. I'M ALSO MORE WORRIED TO BE HONEST. AS WE HEAD INTO NEXT YEAR. OUR STANDARD METHODS OF EVALUATION AREN'T KEEPING UP WITH. THESE CASCADING CLIMATE EFFECTS SO I AM VERY FOCUSED ON. NOT ONLY WHAT I CAN DO TO MEDICAID AS AN EXAMPLE WE SUCCESSFULLY MOVE SEVENTEEN MILLION SALMON FISH. AT OUR CENTRAL VALLEY HATCHERIES DOWN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY SAN PABLO DAY COASTAL MET PENS WITH A PRETTY HIGH SUCCESS RATE SO FAR. THAT'S A MITIGATING ACTION I'M FOCUSED ON THAT FOR THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS WE JUST HAVE RESCUED I THINK ALMOST THREE THOUSAND COHO IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED ANOTHER MITIGATING EXAMPLE. BUT I'M ALSO VERY MUCH STARTING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GET TO OCTOBER ONE OF THIS COMING YEAR. AND WHAT IS IT'S AS DRY OR DRIER THAN THIS CURRENT YEAR. AND THESE ARE GONNA BE SUPER EVEN MORE DIFFICULT DECISIONS UNDER THOSE SCENARIOS. THAT'S WHY MY DEPARTMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN THE STATE PERMIT FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT HAS MUCH MORE SPECIFIC SALMON TRIGGERS THAT ARE MORE PROTECTIVE. OR THE SALMON RUNS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE TRUMP OPINION APPROACH TO SALMON UNDER THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OPINION. AND I AND I GOTTA SAY INDIA WITH FULL DISCLOSURE. DIRECTOR BONHAM WE OWE HIM CREDIT FOR MOVING ON. MOVING IT TO GET THE FISH EITHER KEEPING FISHING HATCHERIES OR MOVING FISH AROUND TO ENSURE THE LONG TERM LONGEVITY OF THE SPECIES I'M NOT. DISPUTING THAT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY THANK YOU TO DIRECTOR BONHAM AND CALIFORNIA PARDON FISH AND WILDLIFE I GUESS MY PIECES THIS FOR US NOT TO COME TO CONCLUSION THAT THIS YEAR IS GOING TO BE WORSE THAN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WHERE WE SAW FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT SAYING IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS EVEN IF THOSE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN- SALMON MAKE IT BACK UP THE SPONDYLUS EGGS ARE GONNA BE COOKED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT COLD WATER POOL. AND THAT'S WHY I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED BOTH ON THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WATER POLICY THAT IS A HOLDOVER NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WE HAVE A WORST DROUGHT IN THE NUMBER THREE MMHM WE HAVE THE CLIMATE IMPACTS OF THE DIRECTOR SPOKE INCREDIBLY ELOQUENT. ON SO AGAIN I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE DIRECTOR CHUCK BONHAM FOR TAKING EMERGENCY ACTION TO TRUCK ALL STATE HATCHERY S. SALMON. THIS YEAR BECAUSE RELEASING THEM INTO THE RIVERS WOULD HAVE MOST LIKELY MEANT 1100% MORTALITY IN ME SENATOR YEAH PLEASE GO AHEAD. ONE GLIMMER OF HOPE SO INNOCENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN SACRAMENTO. THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER DYNAMIC. OF ALL OF THEM. SO OUR DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE YOUR LEADERSHIP WE HAVE FUNDED A LOT OF. REMOVAL OF BARRIERS. AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FISH PASSAGE AND WHAT'S CALLED BATTLE CREEK. IS A TRIBUTARY TO THE UPPER SACRAMENTO. AND WE HAVE RELEASED JUVENILE WINNER RUN INTO BATTLE CREEK AFTER ALL OF THAT WORK. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN BATTLE CREEK LAST YEAR. THIS YEAR'S WE'RE GETTING RETURNING CHINOOK ADULTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. AND WE'RE ALMOST DONE WITH FULL BARRIER REMOVAL AND THEN PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY SURRENDERS THEIR HYDRO LICENSE AND BATTLE CREEK IS ON THE BRINK OF BECOMING A LISTS FREE FLOWING STREAM. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE UPPER SACRAMENTO WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT. IT IS A CORE POTENTIAL REFUGIA FOR WINTER RUN AND SPRING RUN TO MAKE A HOME IN A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO COOL COLD WATER. AND GET OUT OF THAT STRETCH OF THE UPPER SACRAMENTO AND ALL ME LITERALLY GET OUT WE NEED TO MANAGE THAT AS WELL. BUT HAVE AN ADDITIONAL HABITAT RESOURCE FOR THE SPANISH WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET THE RECOVERY WILL REBOUND UNLESS WE'RE DEALING WITH THESE DIFFICULT WATER MANAGEMENT ISSUES. THIS UPPER SACRAMENTO DYNAMIC BUT ALSO DOING THINGS LIKE BATTLE CREEK WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO DO IN THE KLAMATH. GIVING FISH ACCESS TO COOL COLD HABITAT OUT OF THE HOT CENTRAL VALLEY RIVERS IS ITSELF THE SALMON RESILIENCY CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY. SO IT'S GRAHAM I AGREE WITH YOU I'M NOT READY TO CALL IT AS BAD AS LAST DROUGHT IT MAY BE AND I'M WILLING TO SAY THAT. I'D LIKE TO SEE THE DATA WHEN WE'RE DONE WE COULD BE IN THAT SAME OR WORSE STATISTICAL SITUATION. BUT THEIR WITNESS MOMENTS OF HOPE LIKE BATTLE CREEK. THANK YOU MISTER I'M GONNA TO THE EXIT DIRECTOR THAT MADAM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF RECLAMATION'S WATER POLICY FOR A MOMENT. FISHERY BIOLOGISTS AND SCIENTISTS SAY THAT THAT HOLD OVER FEDERAL WATER POLICY IS BAD FOR FISH IN OUR ENVIRONMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT IN THE CONCERN IS THAT THE FISH KILLS CAN BE WORSE WHETHER IT'S JUVENILE FORM OR COOKING THE EGGS THAT ARE IN THAT OVER HEATED WATER ESPECIALLY IN THE SACRAMENTO. RIVER CAN YOU GIVE US YOUR THOUGHTS THE BOARD STOCK ON. THE PLAN TO BE ABLE TO WHETHER IT'S TO CHALLENGE THIS FEDERAL POLICY IN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S MAKING IT WORSE. FOR THOSE ALREADY IMPAIRED WATERSHEDS. HI YES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I HAVING- THE REVISED BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS DURING THE LAST ADMINISTRATION- CERTAINLY- CHANGED THE COACH UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT- IN THE WAY THE FEDERAL PROJECTS WERE WERE MANAGED ON ON ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE CONTINUED TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH THE BUREAU- THEY DO- COME WITHIN THE REGULATORY PURVIEW. THE BOARD- IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND- WE HAVE OUR OWN- STATE- LAWS AND REGULATIONS SOME OF THEM ADMINISTERED BY- DR BONHAM AND SOME OF THEM ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO USE THOSE STORIES TO APPROPRIATELY- CONDITION- THE BUREAU'S- WATER RIGHTS. AND WE WORKS THIS YEAR VERY CAREFULLY WITH US- WITH THE BUREAU AND ALSO WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS BECAUSE THE STATE AND FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS AND- ARE OPERATED IN VERY CLOSE COORDINATION AND WE- THE BOARD. FELT THAT IT DID THAT THE BEST THAT IT COULD I'M WORKING WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND- NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION OF BOTH ON THE WILDLIFE AGENCIES AND THE BUREAU- TO COME UP WITH WITH WHAT IT- WHAT WOULD BE A- NON. INAPPROPRIATE CARRYOVER TARGET THAT OUT SHASTA TO PROVIDE. THEM SOURCE OF COLD WATER THAT WOULD BENEFIT FISH AND ALSO CARRY OVER STORAGE FOR NEXT YEAR- AND- IN CASE IT WORK WAS ALSO A DRYER CRITICALLY DRY- HERE AND- WE ARE HAVE AND WE'VE BEEN SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED- THAT AGAIN THE PREDICTIONS ABOUT- OPERATIONS AND DRY CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN EVEN WORSE THAN OUR CONSERVATIVE PREDICTIONS BUT- WE DID WORK IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH ALL OF THE STATE AGENCIES AND THE FEDERAL AGENCIES- UNDER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION SO AGAIN WE OF COURSE ARE WORKING WITH THAT THE LEGACY FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IT TAKES A LOT TO TRANSITION. BUT I THINK THAT WE- HOW TO POSITIVE SEVEN INTERACTIONS AND WHEN HE- YOU KNOW LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED- CONTINUE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE BUREAU- WHEN CONSULTATIONS ARE. INITIATED THE SMALL. MAKING AN EXECUTOR LOOK AT MANAGING DIRECTOR NOW I'M NOT GONNA PUT WORDS INTO HER MOUTH WHATSOEVER AND I'M JUST GONNA SAY. MY OWN OPINION AND I THINK THE OPINION OF. BIOLOGISTS AND SCIENTISTS AROUND- WHO ARE FOCUSED ON THE SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES THE CURRENT BIOLOGICAL OPINION. THAT IS GOOD FOR AGRICULTURE BAD FOR FISHING BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT IT. AND IF WE WERE SERIOUS. ABOUT BRINGING BALANCE BACK TO THOSE MOST IMPAIRED WATERSHEDS WE LOOK BACK TO THAT TWO THOUSAND NINE BIOLOGICAL PENNY THAT WAS IN PLACE- THAT WAS SET ASIDE RAMROD- IN WITH A NEW POLICY THAT WAS FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION RAM ROUTED THROUGH. THAT MADE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS SPECIES TO BETTER SURVIVE A PRETTY BAD YEAR. LET ALONE IN DIRE YEAR IN WHICH WERE SEEN SO I UNDERSTAND THAT- THE BOARD IS IN A VERY. CHALLENGING POSITION IN NEEDING TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I'M SO GRATEFUL TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND AGAIN I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS. ABOUT YOUR ASK ABOUT WHO'S MADE HIMSELF AVAILABLE MORNING NOON AND NIGHT FOR COMMUNITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS FOR AGRICULTURAL GROUPS ACTIVE HERE TO MEET WITH TO TRY TO FIND A BALANCE BUT- AS LONG AS WE HAVE THIS. DARK CLOUD HANGING OVER US THERE IS NO CHANCE FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE SALMON SPECIES ESPECIALLY IN THE SACRAMENTO IT IS MAKING MATTERS. WORSE IN THE STATE I AND IT IS COMPOUNDING THE DIRE SITUATION WE HAVE BECAUSE OF THIS HISTORIC DROUGHT SO ON THAT I JUST HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS AND GO BACK TO DIRECTOR BONHAM. CARTER BONHAM IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS. YOU TALKED ABOUT LOOKING AHEAD IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. THAT LET'S TAKE A WORST CASE SCENARIO- IF IT IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU MISTER DIRECTOR TALK ABOUT YOUR SITES THAT SAY WE FACE A SIMILAR. DROUGHT CONDITION NEXT YEAR. WHAT WILL THE DEPARTMENT NEED TO DO TO MOBILIZE AND GIVE US YOUR THOUGHTS IF WE SEE SIMILAR CONDITIONS NEXT YEAR I TO SAVE THE SPECIES. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. I ALSO JUST WANNA SAY BOTH TO YOU AND THE VICE CHAIR I CHERISH AND REALLY RESPECT THE RELATIONSHIPS WE BUILD TOGETHER OVER TIME. SO EVEN THOUGH FOR THE PUBLIC WATCHING IT MAY FEEL LIKE WE'RE ARGUING I APPRECIATE THE HELP THE EXCHANGE OF. INPUTS I VALUE THE ROLE OF THIS COMMITTEE. SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IT'S BEEN ONE OF OUR KEY JOINT COMMITTEES FOR OUR DEPARTMENT SO THANK YOU. I AM THINKING ABOUT THREE AREAS IF I LOOK INTO TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND I ASSUME. YEAH IT'S ASTROTURF FIRST I AM THINKING ABOUT OUR DEPARTMENTS ON CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK WE'RE DOING BETTER IN THAT REGARD WE HAVE A GREATER INFUSION OF MONEY FOR THIS EMERGENCY IN PART BECAUSE YOUR LEADERSHIP. WE HAD SO WE HAVEN'T SOONER. AND IT'S IN ONE KIND OF DISTRIBUTION SO WE'RE BETTER PREPARED. BUT IN THIS SPACE WHAT HAS ME WORRIED IS OUR HATCHERY INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS REALLY NOT SET UP FOR. THIS DYNAMIC ALLIES HATCHERIES WE ON AN OPERATOR BELOW THE DAMS THEY GET THE COOL WATER FROM THE DAMS RESERVOIR THEY WERE SET UP TO MITIGATE THE LOSS OF HABITAT WHEN THE DAMS WERE CONSTRUCTED BACK IN THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES. SO RIGHT NOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR FACILITIES IS WE CAN'T KEEP COOL WATER COMING INTO. THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT DYNAMIC IS ARGUABLY WARM SPRINGS HATCHERY ON THE RUSSIAN RIVER RIGHT NOW WHICH MR MACK AND HELP MY TALK ABOUT. WORKING WITH THE US ARMY CORPS'S INS THEIR FACILITY WE CAN RUN IT CAN'T KEEP ENOUGH COOL WATER COMING INTO IT BECAUSE THE RESERVOIRS MENDOCINO CINEMA. DON'T HAVE. TO WORK WITH FORCED WHEN AND WHERE DO WE MOVE THE FISH TOO. AND AS WE'RE MOVING FISH ACROSS OUR FACILITIES SUMMER FILLING UP THERE'S NO MORE CAPACITY. THAT'S GOING TO BE AN EVEN MORE TRICKY DIFFICULT DYNAMIC IF WE GET INTO TWENTY TWENTY TWO LIKE IT IS. I ALSO THINK IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO SECOND AREA. WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON IS IF IT'S THE SAME OR WORSE. BE READY TO MOVE FISH LIKE WE DID THE SEVENTEEN MILLION DOWN INTO THE BAY IN THE ESTUARY. I'M WILLING FOR US TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS IT'S NEEDED IN THESE DARK CONDITIONS. BUT I'M ALSO WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IF TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND ARE WE GETTING OURSELVES IN A POSITION OF EVERY YEAR. LIVING DATA ANALYSIS I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE SOUNDEST STRATEGY EITHER IT HAS ME CONCERNED. THIRD AREA. YES NEXT YEAR ASSUMPTION YOU YOUR FRIEND IS AS DRYER DRYER WE HAVE A- HELLO GENTLEMEN SHADOW OF ALMOST- NO WAY OUT DECISIONS WE WOULD ENTER NEXT YEAR WITH FULSOME OR THEY'LL- AND- SHASTA AND HISTORICAL LOWS. WE WOULD BE ASSUMING NO INCREASE CAUSES AS DRYER DRYER WHAT DO WE DO NOW IS TO COLD WATER. AND I THINK THAT SCENARIO PUTS US AND PARTICULARLY THE WATER BOARD. IN A PLACE NONE OF US EVER AGAIN WHAT'S IT LIKE TO HAVE BARE MINIMUM FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND NOT MUCH ELSE WATER FOR ANYTHING. TO BE OPEN ABOUT IT AND THAT THAT IS. THAT'S OUTSIDE ANY. INDIVIDUAL ON THIS PHONE CALLER PANELS EXPERIENCE. YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE MENTALITY WE HAVE TO HAVE AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S AHEAD AND WHILE IT'S MIGHT SOUND TRITE. I ALSO THINK IT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY EVERY DROP OF WATER YOU NEED CALIFORNIANS CAN SAY. IS GOOD FOR US IS CALIFORNIANS IS PEOPLE. BUT THAT DROP WATER WE CAN SAY RIGHT NOW WILL ALSO HELP OUR ANIMALS PLANTS AND ONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT'S HAPPENED ON THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA APARTMENT FISHING WILDLIFE AND DON'T WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD I MEAN SO BACK. I THINK AT MADAME EXECUTOR YOU'RE FACING THAT ISSUE RIGHT NOW- FIFTY FOUR TO FIFTY GALLONS PER DAY ON THE UPPER RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED THAT'S A- REALITY THAT WE MAY SEE ACROSS THE STATE I WANT TO SAY. THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY MADAM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU THE ABILITY FOR CLOSING COMMENTS IF YOU'D LIKE- AS MR BYNUM JUST GAVE THAT RESPONSE THAT FOR SIXTY SECONDS PLEASE AND WE'RE GONNA BE MOVING TO OUR NEXT PANEL. THAT EXECUTOR ACTOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR WE REALLY APPRECIATE- ARE. ARE YOUR YOUR INVITATION TO COME HERE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT ACTIONS THE BORDER IS TAKING. I WOULD JUST URGE EVERYBODY TO. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US TO BRING YOUR INPUT TO US WE ARE. IN SOMEWHAT UNCHARTED. REGULATORY LAND AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE- WE- DEVELOP AND ADOPT- WORKABLE REGULATIONS THAT- SHEETS PURPOSES OF. CURTAILING WATER USE BUT IN ORDER TO SAVE AND PROTECT- WATER FOR ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL USES AND ONE THING WE WILL- YOU KNOW. PLAYING OFF A LITTLE OF WHAT DIRECTOR BONHAM SAID WHAT WE WILL BE FOCUSING IN THE FUTURE- IN CASE THAT THERE IS- CONTINUED OR WORSENING DROUGHT IS WORKING THROUGH HOW TO MAKE- CURTAILMENT REGULATIONS MORE WORKABLE HOW TO MONITOR IN REAL TIME HOW TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT WATER IS BEING DIVERTED AND USED FOR WHAT PURPOSES AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE WORKABLE ENFORCEMENT. TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DIVERTING ARE NOT SO THAT THE ESSENTIAL WATER USE IS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PROTECT- INCLUDING- INSTREAM FLOW FOR FISH- THAT DOES ACTUALLY. DO COME TO PASS SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY IT WAS SUN HUNG. A USEFUL AND INTERCHANGE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGING DIRECTOR MISTER DIRECTOR THANK YOU SO MUCH AND IS THAT DIRECTOR OFFICIAL WHILE I SAID THAT THERE IS NO ARGUMENT HERE I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE. THAT THAT WE ARE IN A DIRE SITUATION. UNCHARTED TERRITORY. AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION I THINK WHERE WE MAY DIFFER IN THAT'S FINE I AND I AGREE WITH THE DIRECTOR OF FISH AND WILDLIFE LOOK DIRECTOR- MISTER BONHAM AND I HAVE HAD BACK AND FORTH. FOR THE LAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS AND I DEEPLY VALUE OUR RELATIONSHIP WHETHER IT'S ISSUES ON CRAP. ON ISSUES OF SQUID ON ISSUES- SALMON. AND WHILE WE MAY NOT ALWAYS COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION I KNOW THAT OUR HEARTS AREIN THE SAME SPOT ABOUT. HOW WE CAN BETTER PROTECT EACH AND EVERY SPECIE IN THE STATE- AND GREATLY VALUE THE RELATIONSHIP AND KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME REAL CHALLENGES HEAD ESPECIALLY WITH HIS HOLD OVER POLICY. AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE OUTCOME OF CALIFORNIA'S ICONIC AND ENDANGERED SALMON FISHERY WHICH IS ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION SOME WATERSHEDS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER DIRECTOR MADAM EECUTIVE DIRECTOR WE'RE NOT GONNA BE MOVING ON IN APPRECIATE AT THE EVERYONE'S PATIENCE HERE TO HEAR FROM- TO DISTINGUISH CHAIRMAN WE'RE GONNA FIRST HERE FROM JOSEPH JAMES HE IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE YUROK TRIBE. CHAIRMAN JANE JAMES IS GONNA BE SHARING HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND COME TO DROUGHT THE LOSSES SALMON IN THE KLAMATH IN THE CRITICAL WORK THE TRIBE IS DOING TO PROTECT. ITS TERRITORY IN OF COURSE ITS WAY OF LIFE RENDON HERE FROM CHAIRMAN ADDERBURY CHAIRMAN ADDERBURY IS CHAIR OF THE KARUK TRIBE. CHAIRMAN ADDERBURY IS GONNA TELL US ABOUT THE IMPACTS THAT AT THE DROUGHT DE WATERING IN NORTH COAST REVERSING THE LEGACY THE CLAIM IS DAMS HAVE HAD ON THE CROOK FOLK PEOPLE. AND THE IMPACT IT HAS HAD ON SALMON AS WELL AS THE CEREMONIES IN THE SUBSTANCE THAT. THE CREW PEOPLE DEPEND ON SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO WE'RE GOING TO TURN. IT OVER FIRST AND FOREMOST THE CHAIRMAN JANE. HE'S TO BE GIVEN AS- FIVE TO MINUTE BREAK. FROM THE YUROK THEN WILL TURN IT OVER. TO CHAIR AT A VERY GIVES OF DISC MINUTE READ.

I FEEL GERMAN MCGUIRE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AMBASSADOR AT A VERY AND I HAVE THE BROWN'S. SERVING AS CHAIRMAN FOR THE BROOK DRIVE SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. THE GROUP TRIED HAS ALMOST THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED ROLE MEMBERS AND FOUR FIVE THOUSAND ENROLLED SENTIMENTS ARE ABORIGINAL TERRITORY ENCOMPASSES OVER ONE MILLION ACRES. ALONG THE MIDDLE KLAMATH BASIN INCLUDING PORTIONS OF SIX YEAR AND ON BOTH COUNTS. AMONG THE MANY GOALS IS DRIVING IS TO PROTECTION AND RESTORATION OF OUR ABORIGINAL HOMELANDS. AND THE MULTITUDE OF PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES. THAT WE HAVE DEPENDED ON AND- I MIGHT ADD THAT THEY DEPEND ON US- FOR COUNTLESS GENERATIONS OF CULTURAL RELIGIOUS AND SUBSTANCE USES. TODAY I HOPE WE CAN FOCUS ON IT THE ATTENTION ON THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF FISH. THAT HAVE THE CORRECT TRIBAL SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. BUT I WILL NOTE THAT THE ACORNS BEAR GRASS HAZEL WILL L. DEAR. AND HUNDREDS OF OTHER PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES- ARE ALSO PART OF OUR CULTURAL IDENTITY. IN DESERVE SIMILAR ATTENTION FROM LAWMAKERS BUT WE WILL. WE'LL SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER DAY- SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL THE GROUP TRIED HAVE RELIED ON FISH SUCH AS SALMON LAMPREY MUSCLES FEEL IN. IN STURGEON FOR SURVIVAL. OVER TIME THE GROUP TRIED BELT STRATEGIES MANAGING ENHANCE POPULATIONS OF THE SPECIES CARE ACT THERE. MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES MANY OF WHICH ARE INCORPORATED INTO RELIGIOUS. CEREMONIAL PRACTICES. IN FACT ARE UP SLOW LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND THE USE OF FIRE AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL. PLAYS AS MUCH AS A ROLE IN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AS IT DOESN'T FORCED MARRIAGE. HOWEVER THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR EUROPEAN SETTLERS OUR ABILITY TO ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR OWN RESOURCES. THE RESOURCES THAT THAT OUR ANCESTORS THE RESOURCES THAT TOGETHER DEFINE OUR CULTURE AND THE HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM US. AND THE RESULT HAS BEEN CAB CATASTROPHIC. IN RECENT YEARS. NOW WHAT JOHN SALMON PINK SALMON CAMERAS ARE ALREADY. IN A LOSS TO EXTINCTION. IN RECENT YEARS SPRING CHINOOK COHO SALMON AND SUMMERS AND- HAVE CREPT CLOSER TO EXTINCTION. AND TODAY WE HEAR THAT THE CYNICAL GREEN STURGEON AND FALL CHINOOK ARE QUICKLY MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION- WELL WE EXPERIENCE DURING THE GROUND CONDITIONS. IN MANY YEARS THIS YEAR IS THE MOST DISASTERS. I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFETIME. YES THERE ARE CLOSE COUPLE WAS HISTORIC HIGH TEMPERATURES LOW IN THE MASSIVE. JUVENILE FISH KILL THIS SPRING AS YOU HAVE HEARD. ESTIMATES VARY BUT BUT THAT EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF JUVENILE SALMON TRYING TO- MIGRATE OUT OF THE SEAT DIED BASED ZINES. THIS DISEASE SPREADS RETIRING TEMPERATURES ARE HIGH AND LOWS ARE FLOW HELLO. MAKE NO MISTAKE WE CAN'T APPEAR IN ALL THE BLAME ON MOTHER NATURE YOU GLOBAL WARMING THIS MAN OF OUR RIVER AND THE LANDSCAPE JUST AS MUCH. OR MORE TO BLAME. THE KLAMATH BASIN IS OVER ALLOCATED THAT FEDERAL. KLAMATH IRRIGATION PROJECT OVER ALLOCATED WATER IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY THINKING THAT THE WEATHER. PATTERNS OF THAT WOULD PROCESS. NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT WAS A FAULTY ASSUMPTION. AND THAT THERE IS NO ANALYST WATER SUPPLY. M. WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR WATER MANAGEMENT AND FOREST MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES REFLECT THAT FACT THEY THE CLAMOR. MASON PROJECT IS SIMPLY OVER ALLOCATED THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WATER TO GO AROUND. SIMILARLY CUBASE ARE. KEYS SUBBASIN IT'S SUCH AS JASMINE SCOTT IN STUDENT COUNCIL. ARE BEING SYSTEMATICALLY BE WATER OVER HALF OF THE WILD CHINOOK THAT ARE BORN IN THE PLAN WITH ORIGINATE IN THIS SHASTA SUBBASIN PERHAPS YOU THIRDS OF THE COLLAPSE. IN THE KLAMATH BASIN SPEND PART OF THEIR LIVES IN THE SCOTT SPIKE THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE THE STREAMS WHY IN A KIND OF BASE VICTORY STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE FAILED TO ESTABLISH. A MINIMUM INSTREAM FLOW NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE FISHERS. STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE FAILED TO REGULATE GROUNDWATER PUMPING. THAT STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE FAILED TO ENFORCE EXISTING LAWS WRITTEN ACCESSORIES. STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE FAILED TO PROTECT OUR TRIBAL CULTURE. WE DO HAVE GOOD NEWS- THINGS ARE CHANGING WORKING WITH THAT DOWNSTREAM NEIGHBORS NEAR OUR- CALIFORNIA OREGON AND FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION WE ARE ABLE TO STAY. AT THE KLAMATH BASIN HYDROELECTRIC SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT LAST YEAR. THANKS IN PART YOU LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE AREN'T OF FISH AND WILDLIFE.

EARLIER THIS SUMMER THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE LISTEN TO THE CURRENT TRIBES CONCERN REGARDING OPERATION OF IRANGATE ANSWERED. WE URGE YOU TO PARK TO ALTER ITS TYPICAL MAJOR PRACTICE. THIS IS NOT RELEASED MILLIONS OF JUVENILE SALMON ENGINE OR RIVER CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD LIKELY HAD. SERVED TWO X. ARE INCREASED THE DISEASE ISSUES THE DEPARTMENT WORK WITH US. TO FOCUS ON REPAIRING THE SPANISH DURING THE SUMMER OR FALL RELEASE WHEN RIVER CONDITIONS IMPROVED. THESE FIRST WILL HAVE A GREATER CHANCE FOR SURVIVAL WE APPRECIATE OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. WHAT DEPARTMENTAL STAFF THIRTY SECONDS OUT OKAY SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IN RESPONSE TO THE PETITIONER GROUP TRIED FISHING GAME QUESTION ADDED TO THE- AGREED TO ADD COMMAS SPRING CHINOOK THE STATES AND AGENCIES TO REST. THE MOST RECENTLY IN CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT THIS MORAL AND LEADERSHIP ON CHUCK BONHAM. AND THE CALIFORNIA WATER RESOURCES BOARD UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF WALKING AS WELL. AS MUCH AS THE REGULATORY PROCESS THAT WILL ESTABLISH MINIMUM CLOSE FOR STARTERS GAS CHEST RIVERS AND PUT IN PLACE TO TOOLS REGULATE WATER. AT TO MEET THESE MINIMUM FLOWS. THANK GOVERNOR AND FOR THE HELP BUT THERE'S MORE TO DO. WE MUST CAN'T TO WORK GET TOGETHER TO SEE DEMOCRATS THE FINISH LINE. SINGLE THING WE CAN DO TO BASS FISHERIES. REST IN THE CAR. I'M WE AGREE THAT THAT THE CONSULTATION PROCESS IS GREAT- BUT WE UNDERSTAND PLEASE THAT WHEN WE HAVE THESE CONSTRUCTS BUS THAT DRIVES NEED TO BE A CLINTON. I LOVE FACT BASED CONVERSATIONS. I THINK IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED THAT THAT TRAVEL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE IS FACT BASED BASED ON THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF BEST PRACTICES. OUR PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION AND THOSE. WHEN WE HAVE THOSE CONSULTATIONS WE HAVE TO ENTER INTO THE ROOM WITH THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GONNA I'LL LEAVE ALL PARTIES WITH ON CONSENT ON HER HAND HOW TO MOVE FORWARD.

MISTER NELSON WE TALKING TO THE COMMITTEE ABOUT REALLY THE CHALLENGING IMPACTS THAT WERE SEEN WITH SO MUCH WATER FLOWING TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY- IN HOW REPEATING THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST. COULD% LEAD TO SAM IN EXTENSION ESPECIALLY ON THE SACRAMENTO. HE'S ALSO GOING TO PROVIDING US WITH SOME POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION MISTER NELSON WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES I DON'T GIVE YOU. THIRTY SECOND PROMPT GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU CHAIR OF MCGUIRE I AM SHE- THE- MY SCREEN TO START SLIDE. SALAMI THANK YOU UP AND RUNNING. AT THAT HEARING YOU ARE LOOKING GOOD WE GOT IT LOUD AND CLEAR THANK YOU SO MUCH HEY. WE GO BACK TO THE START OF THE SITE OF PRESENTATION- THANK YOU CHAIRMAN- MCGUIRE MR STONE JERRY NELSON WITH THE GOLDEN STATE SALMON ASSOCIATION THIS IS A REPRESENTS THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA'S SALMON FISHING INDUSTRY THAT WHEN HEALTHY SUPPORTS ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND JOBS. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU NOT JUST FOR THIS HEARING BUT FOR YOUR HELP OVER MANY YEARS ON A RANGE OF SALMON ISSUES THIS IS A PHOTO OF THERMAL AFTER BEING ON THE FEATHER RIVER. WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON SOLVING THE THERMAL POLLUTION PROBLEM HELLO THIS AFTEREFFECTS TO YOUR INVOLVEMENT. THANKS ALSO BY THE WAY FOR YOUR GREAT STAFF TOM LOW WESSEL OF CONSISTENTLY OFFERS WISE COUNSEL TO OUR COMMUNITY. JAPON OF MENTION DIRECTOR BONTA MENTIONED THE LONG TERM DECLINE OF SALMON THIS IS A OF THE SHOWS THAT DECLINE DRAMATICALLY WE NEED YOUR HELP MORE THAN EVER. AND JUST A REMINDER- THE SALMON DIE OFF THIS YEAR ON THE SECOND RIVER IS NOT CAUSED BY DROUGHT IT'S NOT CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. IS CAUSED BY WATER MANAGEMENT OF THIS IS A PHOTO OF THE DRY SAN JOAQUIN RIVER WASN'T DROUGHT OR WATER OR- LET ME CHANGE THE DRIED. UP THIS RIVER IT WAS WATER MANAGEMENT- ALL FORTY THERE ARE WE DO A THIS. SUITS SITUATION AND A PRESENT FOR RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE END OF MY TESTIMONY. YOU ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THE ANTICIPATED FISH KILL IN THE SECOND RIVER FOR WINTER RUN SALMON. AS DIRECTOR BONTA MENTIONED THAT KILL IS ALREADY WELL UNDER WAY ADULT WHEN AROUND HOLDING BELOW THE DAM ALL OF THE REST OF OR ARE ALREADY DYING. OF THIS FISH KILL IS NOT BEING CAUSED BY DROUGHT IT'S BEING BECAUSE BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE WATER DELIVERIES THAT ARE DRAINING SHASTA DAM- AND CAPEL MAY DISCUSS THAT MORE DETAILS BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO AS WELL. JUST A REMINDER OF WHAT THOSE FISH KILLS CAN LOOK LIKE THESE ARE ADULT OF SALMON KILLED ON THE KLAMATH IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. IN IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE BUREAU'S ACTION ON THE SECOND RIVER WAS PROHIBITED UNDER THE PREVIOUS BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS- BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THROUGHOUT THOSE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. REPLACE THEM WITH BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT SHARES YOU POINT OUT. LITERALLY AUTHORIZES THE EXTINCTION OF WINTER RUN SALMON. OF THE BUREAU IS IMPLEMENTING THAT EXTINCTION PLAN. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD STOP IT. UNFORTUNATELY THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS PERMITTED THE BUREAU'S FISH KILL THIS YEAR. RECENTLY THE BUREAU HAS CONFIRMED THAT IT'S PLANNING TO HOLD EVEN LESS COLD WATER FOR SPAWNING THE SPAWNING SEASON THIS YEAR THAN IT ANTICIPATED. THIS THIS- REMINDS US OF EXACTLY WHAT WE HEARD IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN. WE FEAR THAT THE BOARD HASN'T LEARNED A LESSON OF THOSE FISH KILLS IN THOSE YEARS. AT THE TIME THE BOARD'S EXECUTIVE OPPOSITION THOSE DECISIONS WERE A MISTAKE. BUT THE BOARD FRANKLY APPEARS TO BE TREATING THESE FISH KILLS ALMOST AS BUSINESS AS USUAL THIS YEAR. THIS WILL BE THE THIRD YEAR OF NEAR TOTAL LOSS OF. WILD FISH ON THE SACRAMENTO IN EIGHT YEARS THAT'S CLEARLY UNSUSTAINABLE. WE'RE NOT JUST RISKING THE EXTENSION OF THE WINTER RUN YOU ALSO HAVE HEARD ABOUT IMPACTS TO THE TRIBAL TO TRIBAL CULTURES THE DEPEND ON SALMON. OF THE FISHING COMMUNITIES ALSO HIGHLY REGULATED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT ACTUALLY RUN FISH. ON THAT MEANS THAT THIS WINTER RUN FISH KILL IS GOING TO RESULT IN MORE RESTRICTIONS ON FISHING DOWN THE ROAD. FONG ALSO IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT WOULD RUN IS NOT THE ONLY SPECIES IN JEOPARDY YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE IMPACTS TO KLAMATH FISH. THOUGH THE FALL RUN FISH ALL ON THE SACRAMENTO OR AND IN DANGER OF BEING. VIRTUALLY ENTIRELY WIPED OUT. AND THESE ARE SPRING RUN CHINOOK ON BUTTE CREEK WHERE WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO LOSE SPAWNING ADULTS. AND FISHERMEN REMEMBER THE SHUTDOWN. OF SALMON FISHING IN. 200-082-0009 WE KNOW THAT EACH ONE ONE OF THOSE TO CALL. IS IN MORRIS FOR OUR COMMUNITY DOWN THE ROAD. SO THAT COMES TO SALMON YES YEARS LOOKING LIKE AN ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER IN ECONOMIC DISASTER PROFESSIONAL AND A TRUE RED DISASTER TRIBAL CULTURES AS WELL SO WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT- YOU HEARD ABOUT OF TRUCKING TRUCK ON A MENTION THAT ALL MY OF THE CDFW SHOULD COMMIT TO TRUCKING OVER THE CENTRAL VALLEY HATCHELL HATCHERY JUVENILES NEXT YEAR. AS THEY DID THIS YEAR- AND RELEASING THOSE JUVENILES IN THE WEST FARE IN THE OCEAN THESE ARE OUR- A NET PEN HE'S OUR OUR OF FISH AT FOR BIGGER MARIN COUNTY PREPARING TO RELEASE FISH. HERE'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN-THEY'RE RELEASED INTO A NET FAN THIS ONE IS IN HALF MOON BAY AND WE'VE LEARNED THAT WEST BAY RELEASE SITES SHOWN HERE IN ORANGE AND OCEAN WE SITES OF THE PRODUCER RIVAL AT MUCH HIGHER RATES THAN TRADITIONAL RECEIPTS RELEASED CITING GREEN IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT FOR SOME FISH. THE AMERICAN FEDERAL PARTICULAR THESE REALLY SITES. DO NOT INCREASE STRAIGHT RATES. THE SALMON CAUGHT THIS YEAR IN THE OCEAN OUR LARGELY FROM THESE HATCHERY RELEASES OF THEY SHOW THAT THESE RELEASES ARE WORKING. OF THE FLEET HAS LOST ABOUT 60% THE OCEAN FLEET ABOUT STILL CATCHING FISH AND THAT'S OUR RESERVE RESULT OF. NATURALLY'S POLICIES. FINALLY ON THIS ISSUE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO SELL WE ARE SHOWN ON THE MAP. IS LIKELY BECAUSE OF THE WAY FISH MOVE IN THE OCEAN TO BE LESS RESTRICTED PROFESSION THAN THE OTHER THAN THE NORTH COAST FOR MONTEREY BAY TO THE SOUTH. THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A HATCHERY RELEASES TO THE BAY A LIFELINE FOR THE OCEAN FISHERY. FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL WE RESTORE HEALTHY RIVERS. SO WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO. MENTION THE HATCHERY RELEASES SECOND THE STATE BOARD SHOULD TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST- THE SHASTA AGAINST THE BUREAU FOR SHASTA DAM OPERATIONS THIS YEAR. THIRD THE STATE PORTION UP WOMEN IN EMPLOYMENT UPDATE AND IMPLEMENT A BAIT OUT OF A PLAN OF. FLOW REQUIREMENTS THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS PROCESS THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT PROCESS HAS FAILED- FOURTH. THE STATE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY NOT IN OCTOBER AS CHUCK AS MR BONTA MENTION BUT TODAY THE STATE SHOULD CALL FOR THE STATE TO THE FEDS TO IMMEDIATELY. BEGIN THE PROCESS OF RE WRITING THE TRUMP BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WHAT WE CALL THE TRUMP EXTINCTION. PLAN FRANKLY. THIS CHAIR MISSED STONE- WE CAN LET KILLS A- AND RESTRICTIONS ON SALMON FISHING BECOME BUSINESS AS USUAL IN CALIFORNIA. THE IMPACTS TO SALMON SALMON COMMUNITY OF THE- THE ENVIRONMENT THE TRIBES AND BUSINESSES IS SIMPLY TOO GREAT. OUR STATE AGENCIES CAN AND MUST DO BETTER AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. IMPLEMENT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND MAINTAIN A HEALTHY BAY DELTA SYSTEM- HEALTH EXAMINER RUNS AND HEALTHY HEALTHY FISHING INDUSTRY THANK YOU. MISTER JOHNSON THANK YOU SO MUCH pMISTER NELSON CONCERT SEVEN ASSOCIATION ARMY HEARING BACK FROM MISTER NELSON MR STONE IN JUST A BIT. BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE COMMITTEE OVER TO MIKE CONROY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST. FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION MR CONROY IS GOING TO GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMERCIAL SALMON FISHERY. IN IMPACTS THAT THE DROUGHT IN WATER POLICIES HAVE ON HIS MEMBERS AS WELL AS OUR OVERALL WHILE THE SEAFOOD SUPPLY. IN THEN ALSO HE'S GONNA TELL US THE LESSONS WE CAN LEARN FROM DROUGHT. THAT WE HAD JUST A FEW SHORT YEARS AGO MR CONROY WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE YOU ARE AT NOW IN COMMITTEE YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES SOME GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. PLEASE PRECEDING GOOD AFTERNOON SIR. THANK YOU I JUST CAN NUMBER ONE YOU HEAR ME NUMBER TO YOU CAN MY SCHOOL. WE GET JUST UP IN YOUR COMING IN LATIN MISTER CONROY. WELL FANTASTIC. GOOD MORNING SHERMAN WIRE CHAIR STONY COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AND MY CALL IN RADIO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS. THE CFA IS THE LARGEST ORGANIZATION OF COMMERCIAL HARVESTERS ON THE WEST COAST. WITH COMMERCIAL SALMON TROLLERS BANNING THE STATE FROM SAN DIEGO TO CRESCENT CITY. OUR MEMBERS PROVIDE YEARS SUSTAINABLE HOOKED ONLINE TROLL CAUGHT SALMON CAUGHT OFF AND LANDED IN CALIFORNIA. OUR MEMBERS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PACIFIC SALMON. AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHY SALMON STOCKS FOR THEIR FUTURES. THE LONG TERM VIABILITY IN THE STATE'S COMMERCIAL FISHERIES. THE LOCAL SEAFOOD ECONOMY AND THE STATE'S FOOD SECURITY WE ARE HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS OUR DEEP CONCERN FOR THE FUTURE CALIFORNIA'S SALMON. CALIFORNIA SALMON FISHERY. AND ALL PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON THEM. FIRST SOME GOOD NEWS. WELL PRESEASON. DEVOTION ABUNDANCE. IN REDUCED OPPORTUNITY. THE DEPARTMENT IS ESTIMATED THE FISHERIES ARMS IN JUST UNDER A HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND FISH THUS FAR WHICH FAR EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS. PRICES HAVE GENERALLY BEEN GOOD. THUS FAR WHICH IS A MUCH NEEDED SHOT IN THE ARM FOR THOSE SALMON HARVESTERS WHO SUFFERED THROUGH A CHALLENGING CRAB SEASON. I WANT TO TALK A MINUTE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SALMON FISHERIES TO THE PORTS UP AND DOWN THE COAST. THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE DEPENDENCE OF CALIFORNIA PORTS AND HARBORS ABOVE SANTA BARBARA ON THE COMMERCIAL SALMON FISHERY FOR EXAMPLE IN. PARTS IN AROUND MORAL BAY IN 201940% OF ALL ITS SPECIAL FISHING REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM THE SALMON FISHERY. THIS IS IMPORTANT AND TWENTY NINETEEN IS USED BECAUSE THAT'S THE LAST YEAR UPON WHICH DATA IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT BUT EXTRA VESSEL FISHING REVENUES ARE THOSE ARE AMOUNTS PAID TO HARVESTERS IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE DOWNSTREAM ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THOSE FISH. MEMBERS A LARGER FISHING COMMUNITY BUYERS PROCESSORS FUEL DOCKS AND FEDERAL ALL DRIVE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA'S SAUDI SECRET CONSUMERS WHO DEMAND LOCAL SUSTAINABLY SOURCED SEAFOOD. AND WHO WANT TO KNOW THE HARVESTER DERIVE INTRINSIC BENEFITS. WHAT ABOUT CLAN THE STOCK. AS WELL. THIS IS WHAT THE IMPACT CLIMATE STOCKS SHOWN BY ONE ABSENCE THE EVERY REGION ON THE SLIDE THAT NUMBER TO THE LOWELL PORTENTS OF SALMON TO FORT BRAGG FOR TWENTY NINETEEN FORT BRAGG HISTORICALLY IS NEAR THE TOP OF CALIFORNIA'S SALMON LANDINGS THE 201-900-1000 POUNDS WERE LANDED INTO FORT BRAGG REGION WELL ONE MILLION POUNDS WERE LANDED IN SAN FRANCISCO AREA. COASTAL PORTS IN THE REGION AND FORT BRAGG REGIONS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO THEIR COMMERCIAL FLEETS IN PRODUCTION SUPPORTING THOSE FLEETS AND LOTS OF SUPPORTING SERVICES DUE LARGELY TO SALMON WATER MISMANAGEMENT. THE SUBPART TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE DUNGEONS CRAB SEASON WILL LIKELY RESULT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE DATA SHOWING EVEN GREATER AND IT'S ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY. ON JULY SIXTH THE DEPARTMENT KNOWLEDGE THE POSSIBILITY THAT NEARLY ALL IN RIVERINE RIVER JUVENILE SALMON WILL NOT SURVIVE THIS SEASON THE HEAT WAVE IS A CONVENIENT CULPRIT AND MAY HAVE EXACERBATED THE PROBLEM. BUT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BUT FOR FAILED WATER POLICIES. WELL BLAME FALLS ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT ALL THE PLANS STATE OWNS THIS AS WELL. WELL SEVEN DIED TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS FORECAST TO BE THE SECOND HIS ALMOND HARBORS IN HISTORY WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR WE ARE CALLING SAID THE MANY FAMILY RUN FARMS ARE SUFFERING WHEN EQUITY NEEDS TO PLAY A ROLE IN STATE WATER POLICY. THIS POLICY ALSO RAISE SOCIAL JUSTICE CONCERNS. MY SMALL FAMILY RUN FARMERS. SENATE DEPENDENT PEOPLES LIVING IN RURAL COASTAL COMMUNITIES ARE BEARING A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE IMPACT OF THOSE POLICIES. WARNING LESSONS FROM THE PAST IN EIGHTY FIVE THE CALIFORNIA ISSUED ROUGHLY FIVE THOUSAND COMMERCIAL SEVEN PERMITS. BY TWENTY TWENTY THEY'RE A BIT OVER THOUSAND PERMITS OF THOSE FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MADE AT LEAST ONE LANDING. AND SIXTY FOUR VESSELS ACCOUNTED FOR HALF OF THE TOTAL AND IT'S- LESS THAN 10% OF THE ORIGINAL FLEET THERE'S LESS FISHING IN CALIFORNIA AFTER THIRTY FIVE YEARS. UNLESS THIS TREND IS REVERSED THERE WILL BE FEWER HARVESTERS AND SO FEW HAMID SALMON TO HARVEST OF THE COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN NO LONGER BE VIABLE. THE HOUSE OF CARDS WILL BEGIN TO CRUMBLE. IN THINKING ABOUT WHAT ACTIONS WE TAKE TODAY AND TOMORROW WE NEED TO THINK LONG TERM. THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS WILL BE CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA'S COMMERCIAL FISHING INDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS WILL BE HELPFUL IN MAXIMIZING THE CHANCES OF A VIABLE FISHERY IN YEARS TO COME. WE FULLY SUPPORT SUGGESTED NAY BY THE TRIBAL LEADERS. ENVELOPED IN MY FELLOW PANEL MEMBERS. WE NEED FLEXIBILITY IN HATCHERY OPERATIONS TO ENSURE MAXIMUM CHANCES OF SURVIVAL. WE APPLAUD THE DEPARTMENT'S ACTIONS IN HOLDING OFF RELEASING IRON GATE SESSION TO THE KLAMATH. IN MAY OR JUNE WHEN RIVER CONDITIONS WHAT OF ALL BUT ASSURED UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF MORTALITY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THIS YEAR'S JUVENILES ARE EXPECTED TO BE THE FIRST. TO RETURN TO A KLAMATH FREE OF DOWNS. YOU TOO CAN TO TRUCKING. JUVENILES PART GOALS TO RELEASED WITH HIGHER SURVIVED. I THINK VERY OUTLINED THAT. VERY EFFECTIVELY. WE NEED TO CONSIDER SOLAR PANELS THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH COULD BENEFIT SALMON. A RECENT UC SANTA CRUZ STUDY ESTIMATED THAT COVERING CALIFORNIA'S IRRIGATION CANALS OF SOLAR PANELS. COULD SAVE SIX POINT THREE FIVE BILLION GALLONS OF WATER FROM EVAPORATION ANNUALLY WHILE ALSO GENERATING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE NEED TO CONSIDER PROGRAM WHICH ENCOURAGE FARMERS WHOSE LANDS OTHERWISE SUBJECT BEING FILED UNDER STATE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT. TO COVER THAT LAND TO SOLAR POWER GENERATION. IN CONCLUSION. WE HOPE THIS HEARING RESULTS IN ACTIONS. WITHOUT MEANINGFUL ACTIONS IT IS NOT OUTSIDE THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY LOSE ICONIC SALMON RUNS. NON TRIBAL COMMERCIAL SALMON HARVESTERS HAVE OPERATED IN CALIFORNIA SINCE THE EARLY EIGHTEEN FIFTIES. ABSENT NECESSARY AND MEANINGFUL ACTIONS THIS FISHERY MAY NOT. SEE THE LATTER PART OF TWENTY TWENTY. THANK YOU. HIS ACCOUNT THANK YOU SO MUCH. MIKE THE EXIT DIRECTOR THE PACIFIC FEDERATION FISHERMAN'S. WE LIKE TO BE TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR COMMITTEE AND LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO MISTER NELSON- MISTER ISSUE OF THE SHASTA TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT PLAN- LOOK. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE IN THIS HISTORIC DROUGHT BUT IT'S BEING MADE WORSE IN ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN AS POTENTIAL EXTINCTION EVENT. ON THE SACRAMENTO IS BASED OFF THOSE POLICIES IN THE PRIOR FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION SO TALK TO US ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE MAY BE SOME DISAGREEMENT. ON THAT BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND GIVE US A TWO MINUTE DEEP DIVE TWO MINUTE DEEP DIVE. ON WHY IT IS SO DIZZY DISASTERS IN PARTICULAR FOR THE SACRAMENTO. A COUPLE OF REASONS FIRST THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CHAIRMAN OF FIRST THE YOUR RECOGNITION RUN SHASTA DAM THE CONTROLS FLOWS ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. UNDER THE PREVIOUS BIOLOGICAL OPINION THERE WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT- THAT THE BUREAU HOLD ENOUGH COLD WATER IN STORAGE AT SHASTA DAM TO PROVIDE COLD WATER FOR OF FOR SPAWNING FISH IN THE FALL ALSO TO PROVIDE A RESERVE SO THAT THERE'S WATER SUPPLY AVAILABLE AND IN IN CASE THE FOLLOWING YEAR'S DRY. BUT THOSE THINGS HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY THIS THIS CURRENT BIOLOGICAL OPINION BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION- HAS ELIMINATED A COUPLE THINGS COMPLETELY ELIMINATED THE COURT KERRY RESTORED REQUIREMENTS SO INSTEAD OF ONE POINT NINE MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER IN STORAGE. THIS YEAR THE BUREAU MAY HAVE A MILLION MAY HAVE LESS THAN A MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER ALMOST HALF OF WHAT WAS REQUIRED PREVIOUSLY THAT'S THE REASON. THERE IS AN ADEQUATE COLD WATER- AND THEY'RE RELEASING MORE WATER WE BELIEVE THEN IS- THAN SHOULD BE ALLOWED UNDER STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER USE LAWS HAPPY TO EXPLAIN THAT IN ADDITION SECOND. THE NEW TRUMP POLICY DOESN'T JUST ELIMINATE THE CARRYOVER STORAGE REQUIREMENTS AND THEN LEGALIZES THE FISHKILL. OF THE IN THE AND YOU MENTION THIS BRIEFLY OF THIS BIOLOGICAL OPINION ALLOWS THE BUREAU TO KILL IT'S NOT EXAGGERATION. EVERY SINGLE ENDANGERED WINTER RUN SALMON BELOW SHASTA DAM FOR THREE YEARS RUNNING WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED THEN. IS RENEGOTIATION OF MULTI YEAR INITIATION PROCESS WOULD BEGIN THAT'S A PLAN FOR EXTINCTION- THE NEXT THING IT SEEMS VERY ONE GIVEN INTENSELY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THE BIOLOGICAL OPINION ESTABLISHES THE BUREAU WAS THE FINAL DECISION MAKER OF THEIR OPERATIONS. ACTUALLY DOESN'T GIVE FEDERAL BIOLOGISTS AT THE NATIONAL FISHERIES SERVICE THE ABILITY TO SAY THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH YOU CAN'T IMPLEMENT THAT PLAN YOU HAVE TO BETTER FOR SALMON THOSE ENDANGERED SALMON PARTICULAR YOU HAVE THOSE THREE THINGS TOGETHER AND IT REALLY IS AN EXTENSION PLAN. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED- MR BOTTOMS RIGHT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID SAY WILL BEGIN CONSULTATION IN OCTOBER FRANKLY THAT'S TOO LATE. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CITED ONE REASON FOR DELAYING RE CONSULTATION. IS A CALL VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS PROCESS THE PROCESS THAT HAS FAILED FOR YEARS IT'S FAILED FOR TO GET FOUR CONSECUTIVE DEADLINES ABOUT TO FEEL THE HIT ITS FIFTH DEADLINE- SO WE'RE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THOSE. ANTIQUATED ANTI ENVIRONMENTAL ANTI SALMON ANTI TRIBAL ALL OF TRUMP. WATER POLICIES ARE STILL IN PLACE AND THE PROCESS OF RE WRITE THOSE FOLLOW. IS MOVING VERY SLOW NO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND FOR THE DEEP DIVE AT BURY NELSON GOLDEN STATE SENATE SO. AND MR AND I'M GONNA GO TO MR CONROY- IS WELL HI. IN THE CONCERN IS WHILE WE MAY BE SEEN A GOOD YEAR THIS YEAR RIGHT- IT'S BASED OFF OF. PREVIOUS YEARS IN EVEN IF WE WENT WHEN. THE SALMON GO TO SPAWN IN THEIR HOME STREAM THOSE AIDES VERY LIKELY TO BE COOKED BASED OFF OF THE CHALLENGE WATER CONDITIONS THAT WE HAVE. SO WHILE WE SEE A GOOD YEAR- MISTER NELSON FIRST- THOSE EGGS THAT. MAY BE COMING- WILL MOST LIKELY BE COOKED HERE. IN THE CONDITIONS THAT WERE SEEN WHICH IS GOING TO. EXACERBATE THE ISSUE OF- BAD STOCK HERE IN OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS MR NELSON IN A NO GO TO MR CONROY. E. L. FIRST I WANT TO MAKE SURE I KNOW IN MY COUNTER WILL WILL UPDATE THIS EVEN MORE. ON THAT THIS YEAR IS IN A GOOD YEAR THE FLEET BECAUSE OF THE STATE OF THE RUNS. ARE IN THE ADULT POPULATION OF THE OCEAN AND THIS IS THE FLEE THE SAME COMMERCIAL FLEE THE SCENE IT'S- IT'S- TIME ON THE WATER FISHING. CUT BY ALMOST TWO THIRDS THIS YEAR AND IN THE NORTHERN PART OF STATE SHUT DOWN ENTIRELY BUT BUT IT IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN FISHING IS GOOD OUT THERE. THAT'S ENTIRELY BECAUSE OF HATCHERY PRODUCTION AND- TRUCKING OF FISH WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT RETURNS AS MR STONE MANSION- AND- AND- AND THE AGENCIES FACE A REALLY. DISMAL PROSPECT THIS YEAR HAVE FACED THIS YEAR ALL THEY COULD EITHER TRUCK FISH- WHICH NONE OF US OF. WHAT WE ALL OF US WOULD LIKE TO SEE HEALTHY. IN RIVER RUNS AND REDUCED AND RELEASES IN THE RIVER FOR HATCHERIES- BUT THEY'LL TURN IT WAS TO RELEASE THOSE FISH THE TO THE RIVERS AND SIMPLY LET THEM DIE- SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE FISH. THAT ESCAPED TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY THIS YEAR AND WE HOPE THIS YEAR WE GET OUR ESCAPEMENT TARGET- OF FACE REALLY DIRE CONDITIONS THIS YEAR AND WE COULD FACE. SIMILAR HATCHERY CONDITIONS NEXT YEAR AND UNTIL HIS TRUCK BOTTOM SET UNTIL WE REBUILD OF THOSE WILD RUNS UNTIL WE DECIDE TO PROTECT OUR RIVERS. WE THINK WE DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE THE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE FISHERY BUT CERTAIN- BUT- DRUG. SUMMER FISHING IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO THAT WE WERE M. THAT ALL OF OUR HANDS AND OTHER SAME HAVE. THAT SOME OF OUR- CAN BE TRIED IN TRUCK TO THOSE WEST LOCATION WITHOUT WITHOUT INCREASING STRAIGHT RIGHTS. COMMISSION ASSEN THAT'S GONNA MISTER CONROY. WHAT I'M TRYING TO THINK OF A SOMETHING TO ADD TO THAT THAT. STUPID IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT VERY SAID- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THE HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF EGGS PRODUCED IN RIVER THIS YEAR. I HAVE NO CHANCE OF SURVIVING AND WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE THOSE IMPACTS FOR AS YOU NOTED IN YOUR IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS FOR TWO TO TWO TO THREE YEARS. SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO TAKE WHAT ACTUALLY CHEN TODAY EITHER BY TRUCK AND THE DEPARTMENT'S DOING THAT BY TRUCKING AND SACRAMENTO IN THE KLAMATH BY HOLDING THOSE FISH OVER UNTIL THE RIVER CONDITIONS ARE SUCH THAT RELEASES MAKES SENSE IN A- REDUCE THE MORTALITY THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT THIS YEAR AND LIKELY NEXT YEAR AS WELL. I MEAN IT'S GOING TO TOUGH TIMES THE NEXT THREE YEARS UNLESS WE ARE PROACTIVE TAKE MEASURES AND ENSURE THAT THAT WE'RE TAKING. IT YEAH ACTION IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE NUMBER ONE SURVIVAL THE STOCK NUMBER TWO THAT THE- THAT OUR FISHERIES BOTH. COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL AND RIVER ARE ARE ABLE TO SURVIVE THIS. THANK YOU MISTER KHAN RIGHT IT'S GOING TO MISTER STONE FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION FOR THE PANEL MR STONE. THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THIS- IS BEING FELT THIS YEAR BUT IT'S GOING TO BE FELT HERE IN THE COMING TWO TO THREE YEARS IN PARTICULAR. TALK TO US ABOUT THIS I EVEN YOU CITED SOME NUMBERS- THE CHALLENGE THAT THE INDUSTRY SEEN RIGHT NOW ON THE RECREATIONAL SIDE. BUT REALLY THE WORST IS YET TO COME FOR THOSE RECREATIONAL GUIDES MR STONE. THANK YOU SENATOR MISTER SHARE- YEAH SWEAR OR FACING AN ECONOMIC COLLAPSE IN THE INLAND RIGHT NOW THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE SINCE THE LAST CRISIS LAST CLOSURE ACTUALLY- WE'VE BEEN REALLY EXCITED ABOUT TRYING TO GET THESE RUNS RE. ESTABLISH AND GET PROPER FLOWS IMPROPER PRODUCTION DONE AND UNFORTUNATELY THE INDUSTRY. I HAVE TAKEN IT. JUST KEEPS GETTING HIT DROUGHT. FOURTEEN AND- FOR. AND SIXTEEN THEN I WILL STILL WAKE RIGHT SINCE- FIRES IN EIGHTEEN AND- THAT HAS LIMON. PEOPLE FROM TO OUR AREAS FROM REAL THIS THE WAY UP TO READ TO COME IS IT NOW WE LAS AND- OF. THAT COME FROM OUT OF STATE. INCOME FOR THE MAYOR SO FOR LA THEY FLY IN ON JETS THAT OUT ON COMMERCE AIRLINES THEY DRY. ALL OF THAT ISN'T DRIVER IN AS I'M IN MY- TATIAN. OUR INDUSTRY AND SHE TWELVE. RUN IN THE SAN VALLEY AT SEVEN AND SEVEN NINE THOUSAND AND ALL SAN. I SAW A NINETY MILLION DOLLARS. IMPACT TO OUR. SACRAMENTO AND- THE BLOOD WORK HISTORY AND I LIVE. A LOT OF SHOPS AND PRIMARY NOW WE'RE LOSING GUIDE CONSTANTLY- I HAD MY OWN FOR SAY THAT SHE ONE OF MY LARGEST DOES BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS IN BECAUSE I. TRYING TO STILL BY AND YOU AND HOW WHEN IT COMES JUST AND I JUST WANT SAY YOU KNOW THE DROUGHT OUT IN AND IS HER STAFF AND A LOT OF MY NINE ARE IN A LOT RIGHT I MEAN I'M JUST TRYING PAY YOUR MORTGAGE TRYING DO ANY THEY CAN OR WAY THERE. I THEY ARE UNABLE TO FINISH AND OUR LOW WATER BECAUSE OF THE WATER CONDITION AND BECAUSE THE FISH RETURN THAT ARE COMING BACK AND SO WE ARE IN DIRE NEED OF ASSISTANCE AND- WERE IN DIRE NEED IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO TAKE FAMILIES AND TAKE CHILDREN AND REINTRODUCE THEM TO SIXTEEN THROUGH THE R. THREE PROGRAM WHICH I'M INVOLVED IN WHICH IS TO RECRUIT REACTIVATING RETAIN. OUR FISHERMEN MEN AND WOMEN IN ANGLERS CALIFORNIA AND FOR TOURISM IN THE CALIFORNIA IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO TEACH OUR NEXT GENERATION SUFFICIENT EVERYTHING WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT TO SAVE OUR FISHING BECAUSE WE ARE THE TEACHERS ON THE RIVER OR THE ONE TO TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO ACT AND HOW TO RESPECT AND HOW TO ENJOY WHAT WE ALL LOVE KNOWN AS SAM THANK YOU. EXCHANGE STONE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE NOR CAL GUIDES AND SPORTSMEN ASSOCIATION WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MR STONE VERY NELSON OF THE GOLDEN STATE SALMON ASSOCIATION MIKE CONROY AT THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION FOR THEIR TESTIMONY THEIR ADVOCACY THEIR HARD WORK AND LEADERSHIP ESPECIALLY IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES IVING US A STATUS REPORT DROUGHT IN THE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL. FISHERIES GENTLEMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE WERE NOW COULD MEAN MOVING ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL TODAY OUR FINAL PANEL IS A GROUP OF EXPERTS WHO HAVE SPENT LITERALLY DECADES COMBINED IN DISTINGUISHED ROLES WORKING ON WATER SAY WATERSHED CONSERVATION. ON BEHALF OF FISH THE ENVIRONMENT AND OF COURSE THE GOOD PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WERE FIRST CAN HEAR FROM MARK BRANSON CEO OF THE KLAMATH RIVER CORPORATION THEN WE'RE GONNA TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO KEEP COOL SHE'S A SENIOR ATTORNEY.

WITH A CRITICAL IN TIME THE UPDATE AND STAND AS THE STATUS AND PROGRESS OF CLIMATE DAM REMOVAL. FROM THE FEDERALLY FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION TODAY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND ACROSS ALL STAKEHOLDERS. HE'S GONNA HAVE AN EXHAUSTIVE UPDATE PRICED AT MISTER RANSOM WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORKS OR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MARK BRANSON CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE KLAMATH RIVER RENEWAL CORPORATION. I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN REQUIRED VICE CHAIR STONE BURKE CONVENING THIS HEARING. AND INVITING THE RENEWAL CORPORATION TO APPEAR. I ALSO LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION PRETTY INSIGHTFUL COMMENTS OFFERED BY ALL THE PANELISTS THUS FAR. AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE RENEWAL CORPORATION IS BUILDING ON THE GOOD WORK DONE BY THE TRIBES AND MANY OTHERS OVER MANY MANY YEARS. THE REAL CORPORATION IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FORMALLY TASKED WITH REMOVING THE FOR LOWER KLAMATH RIVER DAMS. AND IMPLEMENTING REQUIRED REQUIRED MITIGATION MEASURES. THE NONPROFIT WAS FORMED BASED ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE TWENTY SIXTEEN KLAMATH HYDROELECTRIC SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. EXECUTED BY SIGNATORIES REPRESENTING DIVERSE INTERESTS AND RESTORING THE KLAMATH RIVER. THE OREGON IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITY MISSIONS AUTHORIZE RAPER. IN THE STATE OF. PROVIDED ADDITIONAL BOND FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT DAM REMOVAL AS PROPOSED IN THAT SETTLEMENT. THE RENEWAL CORPORATION IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THE CHALLENGING CONDITIONS FACED BY THE MANY COMMUNITIES IN THE KLAMATH RIVER BASIN WHO WERE RELY ON THE RESOURCES OF THE RIVER. THOSE COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH IMPACTS RESULTING FROM THE DEEPENING DROUGHT AND RESULTING REDUCED WATER SUPPLY AND DEGRADED WATER QUALITY IN LIGHT OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND BECAUSE IT'S GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT DAM REMOVAL ISONE IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO REDUCE SOME OF THE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES. THE RENEWAL CORPORATION CONTINUES TO DO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR CONTROL TO UNDERTAKE DAM REMOVAL IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE REMAIN SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY MEASURES THAT MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE WE CAN BEGIN WORK AND THAT SOME RISK OF DELAY EXISTS. BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO POSITION US TO BEGIN DAM REMOVAL AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME. IN SOME WE PROPOSED TO REMOVE THE FOUR DAMS OF THE LOWER KLAMATH HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT J. C. BOYLE COPCO NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO AND RON GATE DOWN. ALONG WITH POWER HOUSES AND OTHER PERTINENT FACILITIES TO RESTORE FREE FLOWING CONDITIONS AND VOLITIONAL FISH PASSAGE IN THE KLAMATH RIVER. WE WILL ALSO IMPLEMENT OTHER MEASURES TO RESTORE FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT IN THE D. WATER RESERVOIR FOOTPRINTS AND ELSEWHERE IN THE PROJECT BOUNDARY. OUR WORK INCLUDES PERFORMING VARIOUS FORMS OF MITIGATION AND RESTORATION ON NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND ACRES OF LANDS WHICH MAKE UP THE PROJECT AREA. IN PREPARATION FOR DAM REMOVAL THE RENEWAL CORPORATION IN OUR CONTRACTORS HAVE DESIGNED A ROBUST RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY INCLUDES A PACKAGE OF TANGIBLE ASSETS THAT INCLUDES BONDING INSURANCE GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICING CONTRACTS IN SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENCY PLANS. WE HAVE NEGOTIATED CAPS ON ESCALATION COSTS WITH OUR MAJOR CONTRACTORS TO LIMIT IMPACTS OF INFLATION OR OTHER UPWARD ECONOMIC PRESSURES ON PRICES. ARE BUDGET OF ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTINGENCY FUNDS HELD BY THE RENEWAL CORPORATION IN OUR CONTRACTORS. REMAINS SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT ACCORDING TO OUR CURRENT PLANS AND SCHEDULES REDUCING LIKELIHOOD THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL BE REQUIRED. BASED ON A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF OUR QUALIFICATIONS ON JUNE SEVENTEENTH OF THIS YEAR THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION APPROVED OUR APPLICATION TO TRANSFER THE OPERATING LICENSE FROM PACIFICORP TO THE RENEWAL CORPORATION IN THE STATE'S A CALIFORNIA AND OREGON. THAT ACTION WAS A MAJOR REGULATORY MILESTONE AND AN ENDORSEMENT AT THE PARTY'S POSSESSED ALL THE CAPACITY NECESSARY TO BECOME COAL LICENSEES FOR PURPOSES OF DAM REMOVAL. THAT SAME DAY IN THE LICENSE RENDER PROCEEDING FIRST PUBLISHED ITS NOTICE OF INTENT TO COMPLY WITH THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT AND LAID OUT ITS APPROACH IN SCHEDULE FOR CONDUCTING COMPREHENSIVE NEED A VALUATIONS. IN ADDITION TO FIRST PREPARATION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT THE PROJECT REQUIRES BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS FROM THE US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE AND THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE. THE CLEAN WATER ACT PERMIT FROM THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND AUTHORIZATION UNDER THE NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT. EACH OF THOSE AUTHORIZATIONS IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY THE RENEWAL CORPORATION IS HOPEFUL THESE AGENCIES WILL MAINTAIN AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULES FOR COMPLETION OF THESE APPROVALS AND THAT FOR WILL ISSUE A LICENSE SURRENDER ORDER IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OREGON HAVE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATIONS AND OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS FOR THE PROJECT. IN ADDITION THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION RECENTLY APPROVED PACIFICORP TO REQUEST TO TRANSFER THE ASSETS OF THE LOWER KLAMATH PROJECT TO THE RENEWAL CORPORATION. THE OREGON PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO TAKE UP THIS MATTER AT TODAY'S COMMISSION MEETING. OUR PROPOSED PROJECT INCLUDES A SEQUENCE OF ACTIVITIES LEADING TO DAM REMOVAL. WE WILL IMPROVE COUNTY ROADS AND BRIDGES TO ENHANCE SAFETY AND SUPPORT HEAVY CONSTRUCTION VEHICLES. WE WILL RELOCATE THE CITY OF WHY BECAUSE WATER LINE WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE EXPOSED WHEN IRON GATE RESERVOIR IS THE WATER. AND MAKE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. ARE SCHEDULE CALLS FOR ROUGHLY SIX MONTHS OF PREPARATORY WORK FOLLOWING THAT WORK RESERVOIR DRAWDOWN WILL OCCUR BETWEEN JANUARY AND JUNE WITH DAM REMOVAL AND EARLY RESTORATION IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER. THE FOLLOWING YEAR RESTORATION ACTIVITIES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO PLANT NATIVE VEGETATION CONSTRUCT HABITAT IMPROVEMENTS ENSURE TRIBUTARY ACCESSIBILITY CONSTRUCT RECREATION FACILITIES AND IMPLEMENT OUR WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT PLAN WHICH IN WHICH INCLUDES A SERIES OF MEASURES TO OFFSET LOSS OF RESERVOIRS. AND GIVE FIRE MANAGEMENT AGENCIES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR EARLY DETECTION AND MONITORING AS WELL AS ENHANCED FIREFIGHTING CAPABILITIES. MONITORING AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES WILL CONTINUE FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS AFTER THAT OUR MANAGEMENT PLANS ARE DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE PERFORMANCE METRICS IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS IN A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS OR SO. IN SUMMARY WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD ESTABLISHING FREE FLOWING CONDITIONS ON THE KLAMATH RIVER AND IMPROVING CONDITIONS TO SUPPORT RETURNING HEALTHY RUNS OF SALMON AND TO RESTORE AND SUSTAIN OTHER IMPORTANT WATERSHED VALUES. AND YET MUCH MORE WORK LIES AHEAD DURING A TIME OF EXTRAORDINARY STRESS AND STRAIN ON THE KLAMATH RIVER AND THE MANY COMMUNITIES WHO RELY ON ITS RESOURCES. THE RENEWAL CORPORATION AND OUR PARTNERS WILL CONTINUE TO DO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR CONTROL TO BEGIN EARLY CONSTRUCTION WORK IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. EXCUSE ME IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND DAM REMOVAL IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AGAIN I THINK SENATE SENATOR MCGUIRE CHAIR MCGUIRE VICE CHAIR STONE IN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE INVITATION TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH THE RANSOM AND WE NEED THAT SAY HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE TO MISTER RANSOM- IN THE ENTIRE. TEAM FOR YOUR TREMENDOUS WORK IN PROGRESS IT'S HISTORIC- IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT JUNE THANK YOU TO THE KLAMATH RIVER RENEWAL CORPORATION- FOR ALL OF THEIR EFFORTS THAT IS IN GERMANY COMMITTEE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE MOVING ON TO HEAR FROM KEEP POOL. SENIOR ATTORNEY FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT SHE'S RETURNING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON CALIFORNIA'S SIEMENS SITUATION. AND SHE'S ALSO GOING TO VIED A BRIEF ABOUT HOW ENVIRONMENT OUR WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. HAS WITHSTOOD THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND ITS CONTINUING IMPACTS ARE GOING TO HEAR BOTH SIDES MS POOLE IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU SORRY IT IS NOT IN PERSON THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME FOR YOUR ADVOCACY- IN YOUR PARTNERSHIP. THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU ARE NOW IN COMMITTEE YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. THANK YOU TERM REQUIRE CAN YOU HEAR ME AND SEEN OKAY YOU'RE COMING IN LOUD AND CLEAR WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR AFFECT WELL GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BYRON VICE CHAIR STONE. AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TODAY. AS YOU HEARD IN THIS SECOND YEAR OF DRY CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA SALMON RUNS ALL OVER THE STATE. ARE SUFFERING HIGH RATES OF MORTALITY. PLEASE LEGAL WATER TEMPERATURES LIKELY TO CAROL NEARLY ALL OF THE EXAM PRIOR BEEN DANGER TO WINTER RUN SALMON. AND THE COMMERCIAL IMPORTANT FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON THAT SPAWN IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. THIS HIGH DEATH RATE IS NOT INEVITABLE NOR THE RESULT OF A NATURAL DISASTER THAT CAUGHT US BY SURPRISE. INSTEAD PRIMARILY DUE TO MISMANAGEMENT OF OUR WATER SYSTEM INCLUDING A FAILURE TO PLAN OR PREDICTABLE AND RECURRING DROUGHTS. AS WELL AS THE CHOICE TO PRIORITIZE WATER DELIVERIES TO BIG AGRIBUSINESS OVER PROTECTING SALMON IN CALIFORNIA'S NATIONAL WILDLIFE. THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS THE AUTHORITY TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS. COULD HE NOW GRAYSON TO PROTECT THE COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT FALL RUNS. UNFORTUNATELY THE BOARD HAS DONE LITTLE TO EXERCISE ITS CONSIDERABLE AUTHORITY TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS FOR SALMON THIS YEAR. AS WE HEARD FROM THE SO BACK. SHE STATED THAT THE STATE BOARD HAS WORKED TO PROTECT TO THE COLD WATER POOL ENTRANCE TO THIS YEAR. WELL YOU KNOW AS WE CAN ALL SEE FROM THE SORRY STATE OF THE COLD WATER PULLING SHOTS DOWN. ABOUT HALF HEARTED EFFORT AS BAIL. AND AS A RESULT FISHING COMMUNITIES INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO CARE ABOUT SALMON AND HEALTHY ECOSYSTEMS THEY NURTURE. WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BOARD'S INACTION FOR YEARS TO COME. GENERALLY ON THE SACRAMENTO TEMPERATURES ABOVE FIFTY SIX DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. OUR LEAD OFFER SHINNOK EGGS AND FRY AND WATER TEMPERATURES ABOUT FIFTY THREE POINT FIVE DEGREES ARE LETHAL TO ENDANGERED WINTER RUN CHINOOK SALMON X. THIS YEAR AT THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION WHICH OPERATES SHASTA DAM IS ON TRACK TO EXCEED THOSE TEMPERATURE THRESHOLDS. ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. STARTING NEXT MONTH AND- ARE CONTINUING TO EXCEED THEM THROUGH NOVEMBER. THAT IS THE PERIOD WHEN- THE EX OF BOTH WINTER RUN AND FALL RUN CHINOOK NEED COLD WATER TO SURVIVE. THE SALMON DOESN'T HIGH TEMPERATURES COULD BE AVOIDED IF RECLAMATION REDUCED WATER DELIVERIES TO THEIR CONTRACTORS MAINTAIN A HIGHER LEVEL OF WATER STORAGE IN CHASTAIN CONSERVED MORE COLD WATER IN THE BOTTOM OF THE RESERVOIR. RECLAMATION IS LARGELY DRAIN THE RESERVOIR IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE WATER DELIVERIES TO ITS CONTRACT. THOSE DELIVERIES ARE ON TRACK TO EXCEED THREE POINT FIVE MILLION ACRE FEET THIS YEAR MOSTLY TO AGRIBUSINESS. THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE STATE WATER BOARD WHICH HAS TO OUR REVIEW AND APPROVE RECLAMATION'S TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR SHASTA EVERY YEAR UNDER RECLAMATION STATE WATER RATES PERMITS. BECAUSE OF BAD AUTHORITY THE STATE WATER BOARD KIND OF REQUIRED RECLAMATION TO OPERATE SHASTA VERY DIFFERENTLY THIS YEAR. TO REDUCE RELEASES OVER THE SUMMER AND INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE COLD WATER POOL. IN FACT THE WATER BOARD HAD EXTENSIVE INFORMATION FROM THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE MUCHEARLIER THIS YEAR CHINA COULD HAVE SAVED 50% OF THE WINNER RUN X. AND FRIED. AND INCREASED FOREIGN SURVIVAL IF IT FOLLOWED THIS PROTOCOL. BUT INSTEAD OF THE WATER BOARD CHOSE TO ALLOW RECLAMATION TO OPERATE SHASTA IN A WAY THAT'S LIKELY TO WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE RUN. EVEN WORSE THE BUREAU IS FAILING TO MEET THE PLAN. THAT THE BOARD APPROVED IN JUNE. DRAINING THE RESERVOIR EVEN FURTHER AND THREATENING TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA WITHOUT ADEQUATE WATER FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY IF NEXT YEAR IS STRONG. ASSEMBLY NONE OF THIS IS A SURPRISE WE SAW SIMILAR MISMANAGEMENT DURING THE TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN DROUGHT WHEN RECLAMATION OPERATED SHASTA TO DRAIN ITS COLD WATER POOL. LEADING TO NEAR TOTAL MORTALITY OF WINTER RUN IN BOTH OF THOSE YEAR. AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT AN INEVITABLE FUNCTION OF HYDROLOGY AND TEMPERATURE. THIS WAS THE CHOICE THAT STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES MADE FOLLOWING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WHICH LEGALIZED KILLING 1100% OF THE ENDANGERED SALMON IN THE SACRAMENTO. THIS YEAR SOUNDS WATER IS ALSO A SYMPTOM OF THE ON GOING FAILURE OF THE STATE WATER BOARD. SIX STANDARDS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN MEANINGFULLY UPDATED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND ARE WOEFULLY OUT OF DATE. THE STATE KIND OF WIND THIS RECURRING DROUGHT CRISIS IN THE FUTURE BY UPDATING THOSE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS TO REFLECT CURRENT INVEST NOBLE SCIENCE AND TO ACTUALLY PLAN FOR DROUGHT MAKING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE WAY SHASTA IS MANAGED TO ACCOUNT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND PREVENT THE EXTINCTION OF OUR SALMON RUNS. AND FINALLY I WANT TO COMMENT ON SOMETHING THAT I DIRECTOR BONHAM SAID- BECAUSE HE INDICATED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW ON TRACK TO WITHDRAW THESE FROM BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND REWRITE- AND THAT'S NOT REALLY ACCURATE- WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SADDENED. IS THAT THEY WILL- START THE PROCESS IN A FEW MONTHS. TO DEVELOP NEW OR AMENDED BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE AMENDED ALL OF THE TIME AND TWEAKING AROUND THE EDGES THIS IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE WHOLESALE ABDICATION OF SCIENCE EMBEDDED IN THESE TRUMP BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. WE NEED A COMMITMENT TO DROPPED ENTIRELY NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT ARE BASED ON SOUND SCIENCE AND WE NEED THE STATE TO INCEST. BUT THE BUREAU AGREED TO BE COVERED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. THE STATE HAS A PRIORITY TO PROTECT ITS OWN NATIVE SPECIES WHICH IT CURRENTLY IS NOT EXERCISING- WITH REGARD TO WINTER AND BLOW SHASTA THIRTY SECONDS. AWESTRUCK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COOL THANK YOU SO MUCH A VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY WE SO APPRECIATE YOUR ADVOCACY ONE REMIND FOLKS IF YOU THAT TO BE A TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMING HERE TODAY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE OPENING UP. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT RIGHT AFTER THIS FINAL PANEL THE PHONE NUMBER IF YOU'D LIKE TO COMMENT TODAY'S. CODE. THAT IS ON YOUR SCREEN IS WELL. 877-692-8953 THOUSAND GENTLEMAN WE'RE NOT GONNA BE MOVING ON TO PATRICK SAMUEL HE'S A VERY REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR CAL TROUT THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO SPEAK. TO HOW THE ALARMS BEEN REYES IN THE IMPORTANT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STATED SOMEONE IS REPORT- AND HOW THOSE ALARMS CONTINUE TO BE COMMONPLACE HERE TODAY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH IS SEMI WE WLCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH THIS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. IN WILL GIVE YOU A TO ASK YOU SEE A THIRTY SECOND PROP WHICH IS. SIMILAR THE FLOOR IS YOURS GOOD AFTERNOON SIR. THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK IF YOU'RE COMING IN LOUD AND CLEAR WE SEE AT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HANGING WITH US VIRTUALLY TODAY. THANK YOU CHAIRING COMMITTEE MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT MEETING AND TRAFFIC EXPECT. I'M PATRICK SAMUEL I'M THE BAY AREA REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA TROUT AND I'M ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN STATE THE SELMON ITS REPORT WHICH UPDATED THE STATUS OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S TROUT SALMON AND STEELHEAD. ON THE TAIL OF OUR LAST DROUGHT. TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. TODAY COVER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROVIDING ADEQUATE STREAM FLOWS FOR SALMON DURING THIS CURRENT DROUGHT AND LOOKING FORWARD TO CHANGING CLIMATE CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND. FIRST OFF CALTRANS STATEWIDE CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION THAT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH DIVERSE PARTNERS FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS TO ENSURE THAT RESILIENT WILD FISH THRIVE IN HEALTHY WATERS FOR A BETTER CALIFORNIA. YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THAT EXTREME DROUGHT AND LOW FLOW CONDITIONS COUPLED WITH OUTDATED AND INFLEXIBLE WATER MANAGEMENT. AVXS CONSPIRED TO NEARLY WIPED OUT COHORTS OF SEVERAL LISTED RUNS OF COHO CHINOOK SALMON IN THE KLAMATH TRIBUTARIES SACRAMENTO RIVER AND IT ALSO WATERSHEDS IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AS WELL. WE WERE HERE BEFORE AND OUR LAST DROUGHT AND WE'RE WOEFULLY UNPREPARED AT THAT TIME NEARLY LOSING ENTIRE YOUR CLASSES OF CRITICALLY ENDANGERED WINTER RUN CHINOOK AS WELL AS OTHER SEVEN ROUNDS. CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PERIODS OF EXTREME DROUGHT IT WILL DEGRADE OUR ECOSYSTEM AND THREATENED OUR COLD WATER FISHES LIKE SALMON WITHOUT CONCERTED ACTION TO CHANGE HOW WE PREPARE FOR. AND PREPARE FOR DROUGHT AND ALSO MANAGE OUR WATER SYSTEMS. HELP AVOID CATASTROPHIC LOSSES OF SALMON MOVING FORWARD WE RECOMMEND FIVE SPECIFIC ACTIONS. FIRST FUNCTIONAL FLOATS CAL TROUT SUPPORTS DEVELOPMENT OF A DROUGHT EMERGENCY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SHASTA AND SCOTT RIVERS BUT MORE IS NEEDED STATEWIDE WE ENCOURAGE THE CALIFORNIA EPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO CONSIDER LONG TERM MANAGEMENT OF PROTECTIONS FOR SOME ON ITS BY IMPLEMENTING TARGET FUNCTIONAL FLOW REGIMES FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA. BETTER BASED ON RIGOROUS SCIENCE AND CLIMATE PROJECTIONS FRONT A REALITY. AFFECTION DEFECTIVE FUNCTIONAL FLOWS SHOULD INCLUDE FIVE COMPONENTS. FALL PULSE FLOWS TO ATTRACT ADULTS UPSTREAM. WHAT SEASON PEAK FLOW TO ENABLE REACHING TRIBUTARIES FOR SPAWNING. WET SEASON BASE FLOWS TO KEEP THOSE REDS WEDDED. BRING RECESSION FLOW TO HELP GET YOU THE NILES AND SMALTZ OUT AND THEN TRY SEASON BASED FOLK FOR THOSE SPECIES THAT OVER SUMMER IN OUR WATER SAID WE SPIN OUR WATERSHEDS SUCH AS JUVENILE COHO SALMON. WE NEED ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT. WE ENCOURAGE EFFECTIVE CURTAILING THE WATER DIVERSIONS BOTH SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER WITHDRAWALS ON PRIVATE LANDS. VOLUNTARY MEASURES ARE IMPORTANT BUT INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE FUNCTIONAL FLOWS NEEDED TO SUPPORT ALL LIFE CELLMARK ALL LIFE STAGES OF SAMANIDS. ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING WATER RIGHTS REQUIRES EXPANDING SUFFICIENT STREAM GAUGING AND UPGRADING DATABASES TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF THESE FLOWS. AND TO ENSURE THAT DEDICATED WATER ENDS UP IN STREAMS. THIRD WE NEED TO DROUGHT SECTION OF THE VISION OF WATER RIGHTS. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY WESTERN STATE TO NOT HAVE A PERMANENT DROUGHT UNIT. THE SALMON IS YOUR COALITION COMPRISED OF TROUT UNLIMITED THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND CAL TROUT AND URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO PERMANENTLY FUND A DEDICATED DROUGHT SECTION TO SUPPORT REAL TIME MANAGEMENT. AND PROCESSING REGULATORY APPROVALS TO DROUGHT RESPONSE. FOR FLEXIBILITY. WE NEED BETTER INCENTIVES FOR LANDOWNERS FOR SUFFICIENT LONG TERM WATER LEASES AND FLEXIBILITY IN FUNDING APARTMENT FOR SECURING SHORT TERM LEASES DURING DROUGHT EMERGENCIES LIKE OR AND NOW. WE NEED THIS FUNDING ALLOCATED AGENCIES AND INTO THE POCKETS OF LANDOWNERS BY SEPTEMBER FIRST AND MUNCH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE THIS SEASON. IF THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE THIS MONEY SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TOWARD MANDATORY CURTAILMENT ENFORCEMENT. AND FINALLY FIVE ADDITIONAL DROUGHT FUNDING. ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL NEED TO BE WILL BE NEEDED FOR THE NEW DROUGHT SECTION. PRIORITIZE STREAM GAUGING AND DATABASE UPGRADES. IMPLEMENTING AN ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS FRAMEWORK BASED ON SCIENCE. RAMPING UP ENFORCEMENT TARGETING NON COMPLIANCE WITH CURTAILMENT. AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASING FUNDING FOR GRANTS UNDER THE STREAMFLOW ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM TO PROTECT SPECIAL WILDLIFE DURING DROUGHT. WE HAVE REQUESTED FUNDING FOR THESE OBJECTIVES IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE BUDGET. IN CONCLUSION CAL TROUT STRONGLY SUPPORTS STATEWIDE SCIENCE BASED A SPECIAL DROUGHT REGULATIONS SUCH AS THOSE THAT SHASTA SCOTT FOR RECOMMENDATIONS AND KLAMATH WATERSHED SPECIAL TROUT REGULATIONS. WE URGE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY EVERY CALORIE PA TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CONSERVATION COMMUNITY. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS. COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL ANGLERS TRIBAL NATIONS AND OTHERS TO PURSUE A PERMANENT DROUGHT SOLUTIONS SO THE CALIFORNIA CAN FULFILL ITS PUBLIC TRUST OBLIGATIONS.

HERE AGAIN TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HOLDING SIR. THIS IS AMY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GRATEFUL THAT YOU ARE WITH US TODAY MISTER SAM IS GONNA BE HANGING OUT HERE UNTIL WE GO TO QUESTIONS. IN COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA TROUT WE'RE GRATEFUL ALL RIGHT LAYS IN GERMAN WE ARE NOW GOING TO TURN THE COMMITTEE OVER TO DON MAC UNTIL HE SEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE RUSSIAN RIVERKEEPER. MISTER MAC AND HELL IS GOING TO PROVIDE A BRIEFING ABOUT HOW MANAGEMENT OF THE VITAL WATER SYSTEMS THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED IN BOTH CINEMA AND MENDOCINO COUNTIES HAVE GONE FROM EXTRAORDINARY FLOOD. TO DEVASTATING DROUGHT IN JUST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS- AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE RESILIENT FOR FISH FOR AGRICULTURE IN THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH BAY IN NORTH COAST. SO WITHOUT FURTHER DO WE ARE GOING TO WELCOME MR MACK IN HELL TO COMMITTEE THIS AMERICAN HILL IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP SIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES WE'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. WELCOME MR MECHANISM. THANK YOU GOOD AFTER. CHAIRMAN AND CO CHAIR STONE AND FELLOW PANEL MEMBERS. THANK YOU BOTH FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE TODAY I'VE REALLY ENJOYED HEARING ALL THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS AND CERTAINLY AGREE WITH A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS I'VE HEARD. A LOT OF HELP IS NEEDED HERE- TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO ON FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY NINETEEN SENATOR MCGUIRE WE ARE SITTING IN YOUR OFFICE AND NOT. TALKING ABOUT THE HISTORIC FLOOD OCCURRING ON THE RUSSIAN RIVER RIGHT DAN AND HOW I WANTED TO BE BACK IN THE WATER SHUT. AND TODAY AND FORTUNATELY WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF YET ANOTHER DISASTER WITH HISTORY- CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE EXPERIENCING A PARADIGM SHIFT IN OUR WEATHER AND OUR RAINFALL. WHAT'S NOT SHIFTING IS THE CALIFORNIA WATER CODES AND OTHER REGULATIONS GOVERNING HOW WE ALLOCATE AND USE WATER IN THIS STATE. AND WHAT WE LEAVE BEHIND FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE WOULDN'T BE SO BRUTAL ON OUR COMMUNITY IN THE RIVER. IF THEY ARE REGULATORS HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND THE TOOLS TO ACT BEFORE THE WATER RUNS OUT. OF WATER GOVERNANCE IS STUCK IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND TWENTY FIFTY CLIMATE FUTURES ARE HERE NOW SO WE MUST CHANGE. THIS YEAR WILL BE VERY HARD AND I COMMITTEE FOR HILLS BERGEN AND CINEMA COUNTY BUSINESSES TO HAVE TO CUT THEIR WATER USE BY FORTY PERCENT. IT MEANS SERVING LAST CUSTOMERS AND NOT REALLY REBOUNDING AFTER CODE IT. EVER AB SITTERS BARELY RECOVERING FOR THE LAST SERIES OF DRY YEAR. AND AGAIN HERE WE ARE LOOKING AT ANOTHER ROUGH YEAR ON OUR HUMAN POPULATION. SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN COMING HERE FOR GENERATIONS AND GOING TO THE RIVER THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. ARE TELLING ME THEY'RE SICK AND TIRED DEGRADED WATER QUALITY EVERY YEAR AND ONCE AGAIN WE'VE GOT BE WHERE OF TOXICOLOGY SIGNS OUT ON THE LOWER RUSSIAN RIVER. OUR STEELHEAD IN THE RIVER THIS SUMMER ARE ALREADY FACING TEMPERATURES IN THE- UPPER OF CLOVERDALE REACH SAID IT'S THREE DEGREES WARMER THAN LAST YEAR AND IT'S STAYING IN THE HOME HEALTHY RANGE FOR MUCH LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. EXTREMELY LOW FLOWS MEATS FISH HAVE LESS ABILITY TO MOVE AROUND AND RELOCATE. TO AREAS WITH BETTER WATER QUALITY. SIMPLY PUT TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS JUST HARD ON EVERYTHING IN THE WATERSHED. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE AS WE SOUNDS FIRE ACCIDENTS IN PREVIOUS DROUGHTS. ON WE HAVE TENSION BETWEEN THE HUMAN NEED FOR WATER AND FISH. THE FISH ALWAYS COME LAST WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB. TWENTY TWENTY ONE REALLY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL HYDROLOGIST I'M JUST A GUY WHO CHECKED ALL THE RIVER GAUGES I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS. AND LAST APRIL AND MAY I WAS GETTING SO ALARMED AT WHERE WE WERE UP IN LAKE MENDOCINO IN THE EFFORT RUSSIAN RIVER WHERE IT'S CHEATING IS. BAD IS ANYWHERE IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER- COME IN RIGHT ON THE HEELS OF THE FLOWER- THE FLOOD IN TWENTY NINETEEN. YOU KNOW WE WERE REALLY ALARMED WE WROTE A- PIECE IN THE PRESS DEMOCRAT LAST JUNE. TWENTY TWENTY URGING THE COMMUNITY CONSERVE WATER WE SUBMITTED COMMENTS IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR TO THE STATE WATER BOARD IN THAT YOU SEE KEEP PROCESS ON THE RUSSIAN RIVER. TO AND JUST SCREAM FOR CONSERVATION WE NEED PROACTIVE CONSERVATION TO AVOID A SECOND DRIVE WINTER. AND HERE WE ARE IF WE HAD TAKEN PROACTIVE CONSERVATION STEPS WHEN WE ADD WATER. WE COULD HAVE AN EXTRA TEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET. OF WATER BEHIND LAKE MAN YOU SEEN OUR- IN TALKING TO THIS WATER BOARD STAFF THEY ARE HARD WORKING PEOPLE. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB. AND DO IT IN A TIMELY FASHION- THEY UNDERSTOOD OUR AGENCY LAST AUGUST AND AGAIN IN JANUARY WHEN WE FILED UNDER EMERGENCY COMMENTS AND FILED EMERGENCY PETITIONS. AND MAY. AND THEY TOLD US OUR AUTHORITIES LIMITED UNTIL THE GOVERNOR DID DECLARES A DROP BOX MASON OR SOME WATER BURGESS USED TO CLAIRE. AND THIS FORCES US INTO AFTER THE FACT. YOU KNOW CRISIS MANAGEMENT AND WE JUST ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO OF ALL- CERTAINLY WHAT WE SEE THE BIGGEST NEED IS EVOLVING OUR WATER RIGHTS REGULATORY PROCESS. WHICH WE BELIEVE IS INHERENTLY INEQUITABLE. AND AVOID VIOLATIONS OF THE PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE BY ALLOCATING WATER TO FISH FIRST. AND THEN. GOING FROM THERE IT'S ONE THING TO SET MINIMUM FLOWS IT'S ANOTHER TO HAVE WATER TO BACK THAT UP. WE ALSO NEED TO REQUIRE ALL WATER USERS TO REPORT WATER USE IN REAL TIME SO WE CAN BETTER COORDINATE USE AND CANCER STORAGE. AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE WATER. WE NEED TO GET THE WATER BOARD NON DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO DO THEIR JOB. FREE OF POLITICAL INTERFERENCE AND ENSURE THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY ON THEIR OWN TO REQUIRED DEMAND REDUCTIONS. BEFORE OUR LAKES RUN OUT OF WATER FOR THIS CALL WATER LEVELS ARE DEPLETED. WE ALSO NEED TO FUND THE WATER BOARD DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS AND I LOVE THE IDEAS OF HAVING A DROUGHT- UNIT AND EVERYTHING. WE NEED TO CHANGE NOT ONLY HOW WE DO OUR POLICY BUT HOW WE FUND THIS AGENCY IT'S ON MEAGER RATIONS BEING A FEE BASED AGENCY. AND WATER USERS CONSTANTLY DEMAND FURTHER REDUCTION IN FEES AND THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO DO THEIR JOB IN A TIMELY MANNER TO RESPOND TO DROUGHTS ANY GENERAL FUND SUPPORT IN OF WATER SO CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY. BEYOND THAT THE THINGS LIKE FIXING JOBS AND THINGS IN THE SAMIC ARMY OUR WHOLE ECONOMY IS BASED ON WATER BEING AVAILABLE AND IF WE MISS MANAGE IT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR EITHER PEOPLE OR FISH. SO WE NEED TO INVEST IN BETTER WATER RIGHTS MANAGEMENT. AND WE NEED TO BACK THAT UP WITH SOME BOXES RETAIN WATER SO IMPORTANT- I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO BASE ALL DECISIONS- YOU KNOW ON WHAT'S HAPPENING. IN THE FUTURE- I FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WHEN I LOOK AT CLASS. AND IT FEATURES RIGHT NOW SO LOOKING BACKWARDS- IS NOT GOING TO DO IT WE NEED TO LOOK FOR WORDS. AND WE NEED TO BRING OUR- WATER RIGHTS- ALLOCATION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THIS AMERICAN L. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT IS OUR FINAL PANEL WE'RE GOING TO GO TO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. ELECTED TO SEE MR BY SHARE- THANK YOU SO MUCH I'D LIKE TO START QUESTIONS WITH MR MACKIN HILL. MR MACKIN HILLS. WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM CINEMA WATER WHO IS A WHOLESALE WATER PROVIDER TO OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLKS AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THEY HAVE BEEN SO FOCUSED AND IT'S A- FEATHER IN THE CAP OF THE SIM CAN BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ALLOWING MISTER DAVIS GENERAL MANAGER. THAT ELEVEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER BASED OFF OF NEW RELEASE RULES WITH THE ARMY CORPS- HAVE BEEN HELD BACK DURING THIS DROUGHT YEARS. BUT YOU BELIEVE THAT WE COULD GO FURTHER WITH LAKE MENDOCINO- WATER MANAGEMENT WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO A TWO MINUTE SIR. DEEP DIVE INTO THAT YOUR HOUGHTS ON WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED WHAT CAN BE ENHANCED THAT WOULD RESULT IN A MORE RESILIENT WATER SYSTEM THERE ESPECIALLY. FOR THE OPERATION MISTER MACHENAUD RUSSIAN RIVERKEEPER. THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT- WE'RE SO BLESSED TO HAVE THIS NUMBER COUNTY- CINEMA WATERS THEY CALL THEMSELVES TODAY- THEY ARE POURING A LOT OF RESOURCES AND YOU REALLY ARE PERFORMING HOW THEY MANAGE RESERVOIR RELEASES. AND THEIR FORECAST INFORMED RESERVOIR OPERATIONS. REALLY DID PUT US IN A BETTER PLACE- COMING OUT OF THAT FLOOD YEAR AND GOING INTO TWENTY TWENTY- WHAT OPPORTUNITY WE MISSED WAS MORE BASED ON HOW THE STATE- STATE REQUIREMENTS AND STATES LOW MINIMUMS- THAT REQUIRED US TO. RELEASE MORE WATER THAN WE WERE USING. AND UNNECESSARILY LET ESSENTIALLY IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN TWELVE MAY BE MORE THOUSAND ACRE FEET BUT- WE WERE LOOKING AT HOW MUCH WATER WAS BEING RELEASED AND ACCESS- OF WHAT WAS BEING USED AND HITTING OUR FLOW MINIMUMS. AND BY COMPRESSING THAT. OFFER WE CAN REALLY DO A BETTER JOB AND A BIG PART OF THAT IS THE WATER AGENCY IS. RUNNING THIS SOPHISTICATED SYSTEM COMPLETELY BLIND. THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHICH ONE OF THE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO HAVE RIGHTS TO TAKE WATER OR TAKE WATER FROM THE RUSSIAN RIVER IS DOING IT WHEN. SO THEY'RE DUMPING ALL THIS WATER IN THE RIVER TRYING TO MEET A FLOW COMPLIANCE POINT NINETY MILES DOWNSTREAM I MEAN THAT SEVENTY MILES DOWNSTREAM. AND IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND THAT'S WHY REAL TIME REPORTING. I HAVING EVERYONE WHO'S GOT A CALL. FIRST ON THE RIVER OR THE UNDER SLOW IN NEEDS TO BE METERED MONITORED AND MANAGED. IN REAL TIME- WE COULD SEE SAVE A LOT MORE WATER. THE OTHER THING IS- IN YEARS LAST YEAR EVERYONE CONCERNED TWENTY PERCENT. PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE FACING OUTRIGHT CURTAILMENT AND WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THAT HIGH TENSION. THINGS ARE BETTER FOR THE FISH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. DONEGAN HELD SECOND DIRECTOR RUSSIAN RIVERKEEPER THANK YOU SO MUCH WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO MISS POOL IN MR SAMUEL PLEASE I WOULD LIKE TO. GO EAST NOW TO THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEMS IN THE DELTA. MS POOLE FIRST TO YOU THEN TO MR SAMUEL. BUT THEY'VE BEEN IN A NEAR STATE A DISASTER FOR YEARS NOW I'M- TALK TO US ABOUT. WHAT STABILITY LOOKS LIKE IN THOSE SYSTEMS UP IN WHAT BALANCE LOOKS LIKE. ONE FOUR FISH WHILE STILL MEETING COMMITMENT TO AG WHILE MEETING COMMITMENT TO MUNICIPAL USERS THIS POOL TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT STABILITY LOOKS LIKE IN THE SYSTEM SO WE DON'T HAVE A FRIGGIN FIRE ALARM EVERY YEAR- WITHIN THE WATERSHEDS IS FULL. THANK YOU SENATOR SO- I WANT TO ECHO MISTER MAC IN HOUSE CALL FOR REAL TIME MONITORING AND REPORTING THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE- THE SAME AS THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED IN THE BAY DELTA WATERSHED- REGULATORS HAD VERY LITTLE IDEA ABOUT WHAT IS BEING WITHDRAWN LAND AND THAT MAKES IT JUST. VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THE SYSTEM WELL SECOND WE- OUR NEED TO UPDATE OUTDATED STANDARDS WE ARE RELYING ON YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD STANDARDS THAT WERE WRITTEN BEFORE THE COLLAPSE OF THE BAY DELTA ECOSYSTEM AND MANY OF ITS NATIVE BASH AND THEY'RE JUST MOSTLY OUT OF DATE AND THE STATE BOARD HAS BEEN WORKING ON- THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR OBTAINING THOSE STANDARDS AND WE NEED TO LET THEM DO THEIR JOB AND GET IT DONE QUICKLY BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE. WELL MODERN REQUIREMENTS FOR WHAT THE ECOSYSTEM NEEDS TO HEAL. I HEARD IT WE REALLY NEED TO INVEST IN ALTERNATIVES TO TAKING MORE WATER FROM OUR RIVERS- YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL SORT OF FOLLOWING THIS TWENTIETH CENTURY PATTERN OF THINKING THAT WE CAN JUST STICK MORE STRAWSON AND TAKE MORE OUT AND WE ARE WELL BEYOND THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF OUR RIVERS AND MANAGE THAT BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE TREMENDOUS CAPACITY TO RECYCLE MORE WATER THAT'S CURRENTLY. TREATED AND DUMPED INTO OUR OCEANS WE HAVE TREMENDOUS CAPACITY STILL TO IMPROVE AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN WATER USE EFFICIENCY- YOU KNOW MUCH OF THE DELIVERIES THAT ARE GOING TO AGRIBUSINESS IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY THIS YEAR OR TO FLOOD IRRIGATE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES OF RICE FARMS. WE SHOULD BE DOING FLOOD IRRIGATION AND CERTAINLY NOT IN A YEAR LIKE THIS ONE- WE SHOULD GROW OTHER CROPS THAT ARE JUST WATER THIRSTY AND- WE CAN DO A LOT IN TERMS OF URBAN STORM WATER CAPTURE AS WELL THERE'S A REASON THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS DOING MUCH BETTER. IN THE STRUPP AND REDDING CALIFORNIA AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY GOT A LOT MORE RAIN IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE SPENT THE LAST THREE DECADES INVESTING IN THESE ALTERNATIVE. REGIONAL WATER SUPPLIES TO TAKING MORE OUT OF OUR RIVERS AND WERE BEHIND UPSTATE AND WE GOT TO CATCH UP AND WE NEED TO INVEST QUICKLY AND HEAVILY AND ALSO TURN INTO SUPPLIES. YOU SO MUCH MISS POOL THAT'S- VERY INSIGHTFUL LET'S KEEP POOL SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR THE WATER AND- NATURE PROGRAM THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WE'RE GONNA ASK THE SAME QUESTION WHAT INSTABILITY LOOK LIKE IN THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEMS TO PATRICK SAMUEL HE IS WITH CALIFORNIA TROUT MISTER SAMIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU CHAIR. THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHERS ON THIS CALL THAT ARE BETTER QUALIFIED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION YEAH ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO ADD IS. I THANK. SEMINAR I SPECIES NOW IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE LIFECYCLE OF ABOUT THREE YEARS THAT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE THAT USED TO BE MUCH MORE DIVERSITY IN THE LIFE HISTORY. THANKS FOR FIVE AND SIX YEARS OLD THE REALLY LARGE FIX THE ROOF. LARGELY LOST. NOW THEY'RE STUCK WITH THESE FISH THEY'RE ALTERING SAME THING IN THE COMING BACK EVERY THREE YEARS. THOSE FIRST LOST A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY. HOWEVER THEY RETAIN THE POTENTIAL. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF REALLY GOOD YEARS WHEN THERE ARE WAIT YEARS. WE NEED TO ALLOW THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK INTO HABITATS THAT ARE ONLY ACCESSIBLE UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS. THAT'S SORT OF HOW THEY EVOLVE TO ADAPT TO THIS CLIMATE IN CALIFORNIA. THROUGHOUT THE MILLENNIA I THINK WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF AS WE NEED TO HAVE A WATER SYSTEM THAT WATER RIGHTS BETTER FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW THOSE FISH ACCESS BACK INTO THOSE HABITATS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE IT'S GOOD YEARS. WHERE THERE IS SUFFICIENT WATER TO GET JUVENILES OUT TO SEA AND SURVIVE IN HIGH NUMBERS TO THEN. COME BACK IN AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE POPULATION. BIGELOW THERE COULD BE MANY WAYS TO DO THAT. ONE WAY IS ENSURING IT DOES FISH OUT SUFFICIENT FLOW. MANAGED WAY ACROSS THE VALLEY TO GET OUT AND THAT COULD BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS COORDINATING RELEASES FROM THE DANCE. THE OTHER THING I NEED IS FOOD. WE'RE LARGELY CUT OFF ALL OF OUR FLOOD PLAINS FROM OUR RIVER SYSTEMS THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE THE FISH WERE HISTORICALLY REAR GROW PUT ON WEIGHT AND SIZE BEFORE MIGRATING TO THE OCEAN. AND IT'S KEY TO THEIR SURVIVAL. NOW OUR LANDSCAPE IS LARGELY DOMINATED BY AGRICULTURE AND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN WE NEED TO TRY TO EXPAND THE POSSIBILITIES. FOR RECONCILIATION ECOLOGY TO GET FISH OUT AND WATER OUT THE LISTEN AWAY ONTO THE LANDSCAPE ONTO THESE FLOOD PLAINS. TO GIVE THEM FOODS THEY CAN GROW IT SURVIVED. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THOSE HIGH WATER YEARS WHETHER SURVIVAL CAN. REALLY BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT THESE LOW BASELINES WE'VE BEEN SEEING THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THANK YOU SOME MISS SAMUEL MISAMIS WITH CALIFORNIA TROUT VERY GRATEFUL TO MS POOLE MRS SAMUEL WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE. HEADING OVER TO MR BRANSON MR BRANSON IS THE CEO OF THE KLAMATH RIVER RENEWAL CORPORATION. I'M MISTER BRANSON THERE HAVE BEEN UPS AND DOWNS THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND YOU HAVE MOMENTUM ON YOUR SIDE. THANKS TO THE INCREDIBLE TENACITY HARD WORK IN INFUSION OF DOLLARS ARE NOW AND IT THAT SETTLEMENT- IS NOW MOVING FORWARD. WHERE ARE YOUR CONCERNS WHERE ARE YOUR WORRIES AT B. BETWEEN NOW IN WHEN YOU START SEEING THOSE DAMS COME DOWN. TALK TO US ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR I APPRECIATE THAT. THE BIGGEST CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS IS REGULATORY DELAY. NOW WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR CONTROL. TO PROVIDE REGULATORY AGENCIES WHO ARE TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT THE PROJECT AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACTS. WITH SUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR THEM TO DO THEIR ANALYSES AND MAKE A RULING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. TO NAVIGATE THE- NEPA PROCESS AND THE OTHER FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT I MENTIONED INCLUDING BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT RULING. I AND SO ON TO ALLOW US TO STAY ON SCHEDULE. I THINK THAT MANY OF THE PANELISTS- HAVE MADE A SIMILAR COMMENT AND THAT IS SIMPLY THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD FURTHER DELAY. SO THE KLAMATH RIVER RENEWAL CORPORATION CONTINUES TO WORK DILIGENTLY. TO TRY TO POSITION US FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE DAM REMOVAL- WE CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE CONDITIONS MIGHT BE LIKE IF WERE DELAYED YET ANOTHER YEAR- AND I BELIEVE CHAIRMAN JAMES FROM YUROK- IN SHERMAN ADDERBURY. A REITERATED THAT POINT THAT CONDITIONS ARE SUCH THAT WE SIMPLY HAVE TO. MOVE THIS PROJECT FORWARD AND THAT WILL REQUIRE THE COMPLETION OF ALL THE OUTSTANDING AUTHORIZATIONS SO WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE REGULATORY ENTITIES- THAT ARE CONTINUING THEIR WORK IN AS I SUGGESTED IN MY COMMENTS WERE HOPEFUL. THAT THOSE AGENCIES WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THOSE AUTHORIZATIONS AGGRESSIVELY ALSO THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION BUT THAT WE CAN BEGIN THE EARLY CONSTRUCTION WORK THE MIDDLE OF% TWENTY TWENTY TO. DRAW THE RESERVOIRS DOWN IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND COMPLET DAM REMOVAL- IN THAT CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THEN GETS UNDERWAY IN EARNEST WITH RESTORATION IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR FOLLOWED BY COMPLIANCE WITH OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR PERMITS THE RELEASE SCHEDULE. I IS WHAT REALLY KEEPS ME AWAKE AT NIGHT. THAT'S MARK BRANSON THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CLAIM AT THE RIVER RENEWAL CORPORATION MR BRANSON THANK YOU KATE POOL FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL THANK YOU PATRICK SAMUEL.

WAITING FOR AN ARTICLE FROM THE CALIFORNIA KALO APRIL NINETEENTH. DROUGHTS ARE NATURE'S FAULT THEY ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING WATER SHORTAGES ARE THE FAULT OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND CALIFORNIA'S WATER SHORTAGES FALL SQUARELY ON FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN AND- NOW ON GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HASN'T SIGNIFICANTLY INVESTED IN WATER STORAGE SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN JERRY BROWN WITH GOVERNOR THE FIRST TIME AROUND THIS IS AN ERA OF THE LIMIT AND WE ALL HAD BETTER GET USED TO IT BROWN SAID UPON BEING ELECTED GOVERNOR IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND BRACING THE SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL WAY OF THINKING. THANK CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION HAS DOUBLED OUT OF HABIT ENVIRONMENTAL DEMANDS AND MORE THAN 50% OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES ARE ALLOWED TO FLOW OUT TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN. WEATHER THAN BUILD THE DESPERATELY NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO COLLECT AND STORE WATER DURING THE WAIT YEARS GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN A NEW WATER CONSERVATION ACT THAT WILL LIMIT EACH CITIZEN TO JUST. FIFTY TO FIFTY FIVE GALLONS OF WATER. PER DAY. PER PERSON BY TWO FIFTH. THE TRUTH IS THAT ALREADY GOES TO ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES. OF THE WEST OF THE WATER ONLY ABOUT 10% GOES TO URBAN USES FOR HOMES AND BUSINESSES. AND 40% IS USED BY AGRICULTURE A FULL 50% OF THE STATE WATER IS USED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES. OF CALIFORNIA FARMER AND WATER EXPERT CHRISTIE DINNER RECENTLY EXPLAINED THE STATE HAS BEEN LETTING WATER OUT OF RESERVOIRS ACROSS CALIFORNIA FOR MONTHS NOW THANK YOU SO MUCH AND IT'S NOT GOING TO FARMERS AND- RANCHERS.

THESE THE AUTHORITY THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW THE WATER BOARD COULD HAVE PREVENTED- THE SALMON KILL IT IS COMING ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER- BACK HE SAID. EXISTING LEGAL AUTHORITY- CDFW IS MORE THAN EVER EXERCISING ITS AUTHORITY BY SIMPLY RECOMMENDING HOW MUCH WATER IS EITHER ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF THE RIVER THANK YOU IF YOU HAVE. THAT W. FOR DOING THAT. ABOUT TIME FOR THE WATER BOARD TO ENFORCE THAT FOR THE LEGISLATURE- CHUCK BONHAM SAID THERE'S A MILLION FOR QUOTE MODIFYING. INSTREAM FLOW REQUIREMENTS- HE HAS NOT YET. HELP SET PERMANENT INSTREAM FLOW REQUIREMENTS. ON MOST RIVERS IN CALIFORNIA SO. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO BE EXPLICIT ABOUT WHEN ALLOCATING MONEY THAT THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR IT THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT- ALSO ALLOCATE MONEY FOR ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT METERS AND SATELLITES WE CAN ENFORCE THESE THINGS REMOTELY LET'S START DOING THAT- AND ON THE VOLUNTARY SIDE.

THANK YOU THIS IS DAVID HELLO THE FISHING VESSEL CORREGIDOR I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE THE JOINT COMMITTEE DRAFT A LETTER TO THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION THAT'S NUMBER TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A PILOT PROJECT TO INSTALL SOLAR PANELS ON WHISKEYTOWN RESERVOIR WITH AN AYE TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO COOL THE PLANET CREATE CLEAN ENERGY CONSERVE WATER AND CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESSFUL FAMILY SURVIVAL. J. REDUCES WATER TEMPERATURE ROUGHLY ELEVEN AFTER GREASE AND REDUCES EVAPORATION 7295% BUT IF YOU DON'T RESERVOIRS EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR AND FIFTY TWO ACRE FEET OF WATER TO GO OF APPARITION IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. A SHADED RESERVOIR WOULD HAVE GENERATED SIXTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF NEW WATER INTO THE SYSTEM AND THEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ELEVEN AND A HALF DEGREES COOLER WE KNOW THE HOT WATER DISCHARGE WHISKEYTOWN RESERVOIR INTO THE SACRAMENTO RIVER IS A FISH KILLER. YOU HAVE A WHISKEYTOWN OUT OF COVERAGE THAT SOLAR PANELS THE TEMPERATURE WOULD DROP ADDITIONAL ELECTRICITY WOULD BE GENERATED AND IMMEDIATELY INCONVENIENTLY PLUGGED INTO THE GRID THE JUDGE CAR POWERHOUSE WILL LEAD TO OTHER DISLODGED FROM ADAMS OF SOLAR PANELS THE RESULT ELECTRICAL CURRENT EFFICIENCY OF GENERATIONS INCREASES AN INVERSE FUNCTION OF THE TEMPERATURE. OF THE WATER COOLS PANEL GENERATION INCREASES FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE WHISKEYTOWN RESERVOIR IS CURRENTLY UP CREATED IN SACRAMENTO RIVER OFTEN CREATING LEGAL TEMPERATURES OUT MIGRATING SALMON SMOLT AN ARRAY OF SOLAR PANELS ON THE RESERVOIR WOULD LOWER THE TEMPERATURE SALMON SURVIVAL LEVELS HE CAN REALLY PROVIDE ELECTRICAL GENERATION TO THE GRID AT TEMPERATURES I THINK YOU SEE A HIGHER RATING EFFICIENCY. AND SEVEN SURVIVAL AND RETAIN CURRENTLY LOST WATER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY GRATEFUL- IN HEARING ABOUT SOLAR PANELS AND WHISKEYTOWN RESERVOIR IN HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO KEEP ADDITIONAL WATER IN THERE AND HELP BLOCK THAT EVAPORATION DAVID THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR REMARKS WERE GRATEFUL YOU CALLED IN TODAY.

HAPPY TO SEE THE ACTION BY THIS IS WILDLIFE TO ENHANCE THE FLOWS MINIMUM FLOWS BEEN NEEDED FOR A LONG TIME. ON THE CHESTER RIVER.

SIXTY SECONDS MATTER MODERATOR. ONE FORTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS SIR WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DAN MCCANN IN I'M GOING TO BE READING FROM- CALIFORNIA GLOBE ARTICLE DATED APRIL NINETEENTH. OF CALIFORNIA FARMER IN WATER EXPERT CRISTINA RECENTLY EXPLAINED THE STATE HAS BEEN LETTING WATER OUT OF RESERVOIRS A CAR ACROSS CALIFORNIA FOR MONTHS NOW. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO FARMERS GROWERS RANCHERS URBAN USE. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY SAYS THE WATER FLOWS FROM WHETHER RESERVOIRS ARE NECESSARY TO PRODUCE A REBOUND OF ENDANGERED DELTA SMELT AND CHINOOK SALMON HOWEVER THESE POLICIES ARE A FAILURE AND NEITHER SPECIES HAVE BEEN COLLECTED IN ALL OF THE LATEST TROLLING SURVEYS. WHERE THEY SPENT SEVERAL DAYS A MONTH SURGING IN MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED SPOTS BEST PRACTICE OF RELEASING WATER AND HOPING FISHING CREW HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS. BOTH SPECIES ARE CLOSE TO EXTINCTION EXTINCTION. IF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DIDN'T ALLOW BILLIONS OF GALLONS OF FRESH WATER TO SPILL INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN EVERY YEAR.
