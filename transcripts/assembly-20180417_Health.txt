AS MY WITNESSES ARE COMING TO TESTIFY I'LL GET STARTED. OUT AGAIN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE. I LIKE TO START BY SAYING I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH WOULD WHICH FURTHER INSURES PATIENT SAFETY. BY CLARIFYING OVERSIGHT AND STAFFING STANDARDS AT SOBERING CENTERS. AND. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING EXPLICA THEY ARE. EXCLUSIVELY AN EXTENSIVELY WITH FAST TO PROVIDE A DIRECTION AND TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER. MEMBERS WE HAVE A HEALTHCARE CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA THE CRISIS IS. MOST EVIDENCE WERE PATIENTS WHO NEED MEDICAL HEALTH. CARE. BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM CHRONIC ALCOHOL INTOXICATION. MY SISTER AN EMERGENCY ROOM NURSE SAW PATIENTS DAY AND AND DAY OUT EVERY DAY SHE WORKED. AND IT PAINS ME. THANK YOU. IT PAINS ME EVERYDAY WHEN I HEAR STORIES THAT THESE PATIENTS WHO CLEARLY HAVE A NEED BUT THIS NEED WAS NOT WELL SERVED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. MY SISTER WAS ON THE PAPER ON THE FRONTLINE. HAVING TO WATCH PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. OR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN IN ENUMERATED HAVING TO WAIT IN EMERGENCY ROOM FOR HOURS AND HOURS AT A TIME WAITING FOR SOME TIME. EVEN DAYS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE KIND OF CARE THEY NEED. WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT PEOPLE DON'T JUST NEED CARE. BUT TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE CARE. BUT THAT CARE NEVER ARRIVED BECAUSE OVER FIFTY YEARS ABUSING PARAMEDICS AS A FIRST RESPONSE AS THE FIRST RESPONSE. WE DIDN'T THINK TO ASK OUR PARAMEDICS SENDING PATIENTS TO THE BEST PLACE POSSIBLE. THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE THAT THERE ARE CASES WHEN EMERGENCY ROOMS IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE SETTING FOR PATIENTS LET ME REPEAT. THERE ARE CASES WHEN EMERGE ZERO IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE SETTING FOR PATIENTS THIS BILL WILL GIVE THE OPTIONS. TWO LOCAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE AGENCIES TO AUTHORIZE THEIR PARAMEDICS TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO BEHAVIOR HEALTH FACILITIES OR SOBERING CENTERS. THIS BILL REQUIRES PARAMEDICS TO RECEIVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING MODELED OFF THE EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE. THIS BILL MANDATES THAT THE STATE TO CREATE A STANDARDIZED TRIGGER AN ASSESSMENT. CRITERIA FOR PARAMEDICS IN THIS FIELD AND TO COLLECT THE DATA AND EVALUATE. IMP AND IMPROVE LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANS AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE IS CRITICAL FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE NO UNDERLYING MEDICAL ISSUES. AND WHO COULD CARE FOR MORE PATIENTS QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY AT ALTERNATIVE DESTINATIONS EXPRESSLY. WHEN A PATIENT IS HAVING A PANIC ATTACK AND NEEDS MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND CAN PROVE BE PROVIDED IN A TIMELY FASHION BY EIGHT BY PROVIDING. I'M BEING HELPED BY. BEHAVIOR HEALTH FACILITIES RATHER THAN IN A NOISY DISRUPTIVE EMERGENCY ROOM DEPARTMENT OR WHEN A PERSON IS HOMELESS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC. ALCOHOL INTOXICATION AND VISIT AN EMERGENCY ROOM EIGHT TIMES A MONTH BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY ONE OPTION. FOR PARAMEDICS. ALL WHILE THE PACERS SHOULD BE SENT TO SOBERING CENTERS RECEIVING THE RIGHT CARE. BE CONNECTED TO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND HOPEFULLY FIND LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL LET ME BE CLEAR. PATIENT SAFETY. AND THE BETTER AND BETTER OUTCOMES IS THE SOLE PURPOSE FOR THIS POLICY TODAY THE EMERGENCY ROAD DEPARTMENT IS A PRIMARY HAS A PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY. TO SERVE AS A RAPID RESPONSE EMERGENCY ROOM RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL A MEDICAL CRISIS OR MASS OF DISASTERS. ABOUT FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE VISIT THE EMERGENCY ROOM EVERY YEAR. MANY OF HOME COULD BE TREATED BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AT BEHAVIOR HEALTH FACILITIES OR SOBERING CENTERS PARAMEDICS ARE ALREADY TRAINED. TO STABILIZE OUR LOVED ONES WHEN THEY ARE HAVING A HEART ATTACK A STROKE OR SERIOUS ILLNESS THAT REQUIRES A SPLIT DECISION TO BE MADE. THIS BILL WILL SIMPLY ENSURE COUNTIES HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW THEIR SPECIALIZED TRADE PARAMEDICS TO HELP PATIENTS WITHOUT EMERGING MEDICAL NEEDS TO S. SS THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME AT THE RIGHT PLACE. HERE WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES IS WE HAVE. DOCTOR CLAYTON BECAUSE OUT OF THE LOS ANGELES. COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND EMERGENCY ROOM POSITION. ALSO SHANNON SMITH FORMER DEPUTY A DIRECTOR OF SAN FRANCISCO'S I'M SOBERING CENTER DOCTOR IN TRAINING REGISTERED NURSE. IN ADDITION TO KEVIN MACKEY EMERGENCY ROOM POSITION WITH THE WHO HAS CREATED THE FIRST MENTAL HEALTH AND CARE PILOT AND STANISLAUS COUNTY. AS A MEMBER SOON MENTION CAN THINK. I'M BOTH A AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AND I'M THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVES ABOUT TRYING TO GET BETTER OUTCOMES FOR TWO OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENT POPULATIONS. BY ALLOWING OUR PERMITS TO TRIAGE PATIENTS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SOBERING CENTERS. SPECIALLY DESIGNED IN RESOURCE TO CARE FOR THEM. THE TO CRITICAL FUNCTIONS ARE PERMITS PERFORM EACH DAY ARE TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE LIFESAVING TREATMENT. AND TO TRIAGE PATIENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR BROUGHT THE FACILITIES THAT ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. OUR PARAMEDICS TUNICS EXCEPTIONAL JOB OF GETTING PATIENTS TO THE RIGHT PLACE. BUT MENTAL HEALTH AND INTOXICATED PATIENTS HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEIR EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH AND SOBERING CENTERS OR FIFTY YEAR OLD PER MAKE STATUTE. REQUIRES IN THE TRANSPORT ALL THESE PATIENTS TO COMMUNITY E.*. WITH ALL THESE CRISES THAT ARE E. OURS FACE ON A DAILY BASIS THESE PATIENTS WHO OFTEN REQUIRE LITTLE OR NO MEDICAL INTERVENTION AND UP LANGUISHING FOR HOURS OR EVEN DAYS. YEAH BECAUSE MOSTLY OURS HAVE VERY LIMITED SERVICES TO OFFER THEM. I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE CAN ARGUE THAT CONTINUING OUR STATUS QUO IS WHAT IS IN THESE PATIENTS BEST INTERESTS. IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE FOR COMMITTEE E. OURS TO PROVIDE THE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES THAT THESE PATIENTS NEED. TO ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT AND THE PATIENTS DESERVE. FOR THESE PATIENTS THE BEST CHANCE OF A GOOD OUTCOME IS TO BE TRANSPORTED TO CENTERS. THEY'RE PROPERLY EQUIPPED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. WE LEARNED THAT LESSON WITH TRAUMA CENTERS PEDIATRIC RECEIVING CENTERS STROKES CENTERS HEART ATTACKS CENTERS AND ALL THE OTHER SPECIALTY CENTERS THAT WE TRANSPORTER PATIENTS TRUE TO. AND IS EQUALLY TRUE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AN INTOXICATED PATIENTS. IT'S REALIZING A PATIENTS THE CENTERS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH NO MEDICAL TRAINING HAS ALREADY EXISTED FOR YEARS. PASSING AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE WILL ENABLE PHYSICIAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS LIKE ME. TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP TRIAGE INSTRUMENTS. ARE AN ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR PERMITS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY THE PROGRAM JUST AS WE'VE DONE FOR ALL OF OUR SPECIALTY CENTERS. THIS WILL REPRESENT A VAST IMPROVING ON THE STATUS QUO WILL OFFER THE PATIENTS THEIR BEST CHANCE. FOR A GOOD OUTCOME SO I STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE. HELLO MY NAME. MY NAME IS DENNIS MCCARTY THEN I'M A REGISTERED NURSE AND A PHD. FOR THE LAST DECADE I HAVE WORKED IN AND PUBLISHED RESEARCH ON SUFFERING CENTERS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. HOW DOES A SOBERING CENTER WORK MY CLIENT JAMES COMES TO MIND HE'S A FIFTY YEAR OLD TENEMENT SAN FRANCISCO? ON A TUESDAY HE'S FOUND PASSED OUT ON THE SIDEWALK NINE ONE ONE IS CALLED. THE PARAMEDICS FOLLOW TRIAGE PROTOCOLS AND DETERMINED THE ONLY MEDICAL NEED THE JAMES HAS IS THAT HE'S. INTOXICATED ON ALCOHOL AND THEY BRING UP TO THE SAN FRANCISCO SOBERING CENTER. JAMES IN THE PARAMEDICS ABOUT POINT AGREED TO BY A NURSE AND THE SUPPORT STAFF WHO TAKE VITAL SIGNS AND DO A QUICK PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT. WELL GIVEN JAMES A SHOWER AND PROVIDING A BED TO SLEEP IN THEY TALK TO HIM ABOUT WHAT IS OPTIONS MAYBE IT DECIDES TO. DECREASES DRINKING OR GO TO DETOX REHAB. WHILE HE'S RESTING THE SOCIAL WORK AND SOBRE COACHES WILL CHECK IN WITH JAMES. AND SEE IF HE'S ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY OR HE'S READY TO FILL OUT A HOUSING APPLICATION. DURING THIS TIME THE NURSES FOLLOWING PHYSICIAN AND NURSE APPROVED PROTOCOLS WILL CONTINUALLY MONITOR HIM TO CONFIRM THAT HE HAS NO OTHER MEDICAL NEED. THAT REQUIRES A TRIP TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THIS EVER CISCO SOBERING CENTER HAS PROVIDED CARE TO OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND PATIENTS LIKE JAMES. ALL REFERRED BY PARAMEDICS DIRECTLY. OF THESE FIFTEEN THOUSAND ENCOUNTERS LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT HAVE REQUIRED TRANSPORT TO THE E. D. AT SOME POINT DURING THEIR STAY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PATIENTS OVER SAFELY AND WITHOUT INCIDENT. AND MANY OF THEM ARE CONNECTED TO FURTHER CARE. TREATMENT PROGRAMS LONG TERM HOUSING PIECE MANAGEMENT. THIS LEVEL OF COORDINATED CARE AND TRAIN A SPECIALIZED ATTENTION IS RARELY AVAILABLE TO A PERSON LIKE JAMES WHEN HE SEEN IN THE E. D.. MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED THE PARAMEDICS CAN TRAIN. CAN BE TRAINED TO SAFELY TRIAGE AND TRANSPORT PEOPLE WITH ACUTE INTOXICATION. YOUR SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE WILL OPEN THE DOORS TO GIVING OUR MOST VULNERABLE CLIENTS AND CITIZENS THE CARE THEY NEED AND DESERVE. THANK YOU. SO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ARE JUST NAME AND POSITION ONLY. MY NAME'S KEVIN MACKEY ON EMERGENCY POSITION I'M IN MY MID SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS.

DR CHAIR MEMBERS TO MADDEN REVERSING CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND WE HAVE AN OPPOSING LESSEN MANY POSITION ON THE BILL. WITH ME I HAVE AMY MOULIN WHO IS AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AT UC DAVIS ALSO RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA EXCEPT TO GO INTO THE DETAILS OF OUR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. I AM A PRACTICING EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AND ONE OF MY CORE BELIEFS IS IN AND THE IN EMTALA IN THE SPIRIT OF EMTALA THAT ALL PATIENTS. ARE TREATED EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE AND THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. AND THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW PATIENTS WHO ARE ACTIVELY BY THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. NOT TO LOSE THEIR ARMS HOLLOW PROTECTIONS AND WE FEEL THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT ALL PATIENTS BE TREATED. EQUALLY. SO WITH THIS SYSTEM IS A GRATES AND IT IS SAFE FOR HOMELESS ALCOHOLICS IT SHOULD ALSO BE WONDERFUL AND SAFE. FOR ME. SO IF WE SHOULD TREAT ALL PATIENTS EQUALLY THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IF THE DESTINATION WE ARE TAKING PATIENTS TO. IS NOT LICENSED BY THE STATE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THESE PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BONOBO PATIENT POPULATIONS SO. IF THIS BILL IS. BUT STATE BILL. IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL PATIENTS ANDS THE FACILITIES SHOULD BE LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS STILL JACKSON I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION WHO ARE OPPOSED TO AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE. AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE THREATENS PATIENT SAFETY BY USING PARAMEDICS TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY POSITIONS REGISTERED NURSES AND SOCIAL WORKERS. TO EXPAND THE PILOT AND DEFINITELY TO ALL FIFTY COUNTIES AS WRITTEN IN THIS BILL IS A DANGEROUS THREAT TO PATIENT SAFETY. PARAMEDICS ARE DEPENDENT PRACTITIONERS WHOSE TRAINING EQUIP SOME TO DELIVER LIMITED CARE THAT IS IMMEDIATELY NECESSARY TO SUPPORT AND STABILIZE THE PATIENT UNTIL THEY REACH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THEN CHARIS TURNED OVER TO THE E. ARE TEAM WHICH INCLUDES OUR ENDS IN POSITIONS. THIS BILL WILL CREATE A TWO TIER SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE ESPECIALLY FOR PATIENTS NEEDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE PATIENT'S DIVERTED FROM THE LARGE PRIVATE HOSPITALS PARTICIPATING IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PILOT. WHERE MEDI CAL AND UNINSURED PATIENTS NONE OF THE PATIENTS WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE WERE DIVERTED FROM THE ER? THE EFFECT HAS THUS BEEN TO DIVERT PATIENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE PRIVATE OR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE FROM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DECREASING THE NUMBER OF MEDI CAL ON UNINSURED PATIENTS SEEN IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. AND FREEING UP SITE BEDS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS. PATIENT SAFETY SHOULD BE PARAMOUNT NOT COST SAVINGS INEBRIATED PATIENTS PICKED UP BY AMBULANCES ON NINE ONE ONE CALLS. ARE AT HIG RISK FOR TRAUMA HYPOTHERMIA AND MULTI SUB DID SUBSTANCE INTO DUST INGESTION YET THE SOBERING CENTER PILOT PROJECT PROTOCOLS. DID NOT INCLUDE TAKING THE PATIENT'S BODY TEMPERATURES. ET SCREENINGS BEFORE A SOBERING CENTER STAY IS THE SAFEST AND MOST HUMANE WAY TO ASSURE APPROPRIATE TRANSFERS. THE PATIENT POPULATION ENROLLED IN THE COMMUNITY PARAMEDIC SOME PILOT PROJECTS DOES NOT REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE POPULATION. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO PROJECTS THE FIRST YEAR DATA SHOW THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ENROLLED IN THE PILOT PROJECTS. WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY ENGLISH SPEAKING WHITE MALES. LASTLY WE HAVE MADE SEVERAL REQUESTS FOR ALL OF THE RAW DATA AND MONTHLY REPORTS FROM THE PILOT PROJECTS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE MANDATES THE RELEASE OF ALL DATA. TO INTERESTED PARTIES UPON REQUEST WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE RUN AROUND. THIS IS HEIGHTENED OUR CONCERN OVER THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE'S INFORMATION IN THIS DATA THAT AND SEND THE EVALUATOR DO NOT WANT TO RELEASE FOR PUBLIC REVIEW. AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE CREATES A TWO TIER SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE WHERE ARE POOR HOMELESS AND UNDOCUMENTED PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE A LOWER STANDARD OF CARE. FOR ALL THESE REASONS HE IN A AS OPPOSED AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOBEL. YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STORE TAUNTS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE'RE IN A OPPOSE A LESS AMENDED POSITION. TO MAKE CONCERNS ON THIS BILL IS FIRST OF ALL WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT VERSION THE BILL HAS TOO MUCH DELEGATION TO THE LENS DOESN'T AND SIZE TO APPROVE PROJECTS INCLUDING THE ADDITIONAL SCOPE EXPANSION AND TRAINING. AND SECONDLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE SUFFERING CENTER IS A LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THERE'S MORE OVERSIGHT BY HABIT OR WITH THE AUTHOR FURTHER ON THESE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN CHRISTMAS SHOCK OF IT I WITH SEIU CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE A CONCERNS POSITION ON THIS BILL. WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE SO FAR BY THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS IN TRYING TO ADDRESS. THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE AROUND ON VARIOUS TOPICS BUT WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT SCOPE OF PRACTICE AS WELL AS. THE LEVEL OF CARE THAT INDIVIDUALS WILL BE RECEIVING IF THEY ARE DIVERTED FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE. IN A CONCERNS POSITION BUT CONTINUE OUT TO WANT TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS THANK YOU. IF YOU VERY MUCH. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTION ANYONE ELSE SMALL. BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER BIGELOW. THANK YOU. NOW THAT I'M ON TRACK IN. CLEARLY FOCUSED ON THE RIGHT BILL. I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR THIS INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND PRESENTING IT. AS ANY EMPTY OF. NEARLY FORTY FIVE YEARS I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. WHETHER OVERCROWDING IN THE HOSPITALS WHERE WE ARRIVE ON. I AT THE DESTINATION. ANDERSON NO PLACE WORK WE WERE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY A MORE HUMANE WAY. WAY OF PROPERLY ADMINISTERING IT WITH DIGNITY FOR THESE FOLKS. THERE THEIR HOUSE TO BE A BETTER WAY AND I THINK THIS IS. OFFERING AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN HOW TO HANDLE IT SO TODAY HAVE LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR. ARE AT LEAST WHEN THE OPTION COMES FOR YOU TO AMEND AND ALLOW THAT TO OCCUR I WOULD BE PLEASED TO STAND WITH YOU ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS SOMEONE. WHO'S FROM THAT FIELD I KNOW THERE'S. THREE OF US NOW THAT SERVE ON THE FLOOR THERE FROM THE WORLD OF BEING. IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH FOLKS WHO ARE GOING THROUGH A LOT OF DRAMA IN HER LIFE. AND. WERE VERY SENSITIVE TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I CERTAINLY WELCOME YOUR COOPERATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS WALDRON. I DON'T THINK MISTER CHAIR JUST REALLY BRIEFLY. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND THIS BILL SO I CAN COME TO UNDERSTAND A LOT OF BOTH SIDES. THE CONCERNS THAT I SEE YOU KNOW THAT HAVE PROMPTED HAVING A BILL LIKE THIS ARE THE FACT THAT THE EMERGENCY ROOMS IN THE SOME OF THE FOLKS I'VE SPOKEN TO. THEY'RE NOT STAFF TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WHEN THE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER OR YOU KNOW OTHER TYPES OF. PERSONNEL SO THAT'S AN ISSUE PEOPLE ARE WAITING IN THE ALREADY CROWDED EMERGENCY ROOMS THEY IMPACT ON CROWDED YOURS. ANOTHER CONCERN IS AN EMT MAKING THE DIAGNOSTIC OR TREATMENT DECISION THAT'S THAT WAS A CONCERN OF MINE IN THE BEGINNING. ON A COMPLICATED PIG CASE OR A PATIENT WHO. THEY'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THEM. I SEE THIS I WAS WONDERING WHERE THIS CAME FROM IS THAT FROM. OKAY. BECAUSE IT DOES DELINEATE YOU KNOW WITH SOME OF THE. THE THE FRAMEWORK OF HOW THE DECISION IS MADE WHERE THE PATIENT WOULD GO. ON. WHAT WE FOUND IS YOU HAVE THE SAME PEOPLE OVER AND OVER WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE IN THE? EMTS NO THEY ARE THE POLICE NUMBER THEY ARE MY NAME THEY SEE THEM. ON REGULAR BASIS. WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL WE HAD A SOBRIETY CENTER. WHERE OF THE POLICE ACTUALLY WERE TRANSPORTING PEOPLE WHICH YOU KNOW IN RETROSPECT NOW WHEN WE HEAR A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS MUCH MORE RISKY? THING THERE'S A LOT MORE PROTECTIONS OUR OBSCENE. FOR THAT BUT ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THE SOBRIETY CENTER OR IN YOUR CASE HAVING. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CENTER IS THE ABILITY THEN TO OR HAVE CASE MANAGEMENT AROUND THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME IN. SO YOU KNOW BEFORE IT WAS JUST. IN THE BEGINNING IT'S NEW KIND OF EVOLVE FROM A BED TO. SLEEP IN AND GET OVER YOUR YOU KNOW. ALCOHOL. CONSUMPTION AND THEN IN THE MORNING THEY WERE DEALT WITH CERTAIN RATHER THAN TRANSPORTING SOME TO JAIL. TO NOW THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY OPEN CASE MANAGEMENT ON EVERYONE THAT COMES IN SO THEN THERE FOLLOWED UP FROM THEN ON. IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO AVOID THIS REPETITION OF BEING TAKEN YOU KNOW EITHER TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR TO THE. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CENTER. SO THAT WAS. BUT THE POINT I WANTED TO TAKE AND I KNOW THIS DISCUSSION OF AMENDMENTS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE TAKEN ANY AT THIS POINT BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE. IT'S THE AMENDMENTS AND THE ANALYSIS OF THOSE THE. YES I WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS AND SURLY. THERE'S A WILLINGNESS ON MY PART TO WORK WITH THOSE WHO HAVE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL TO TRY TO HOPEFULLY MOVE INTO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN MOVE THE OPPOSITION EVEN TO A NEUTRAL. AND WE BELIEVE THIS IS A GOOD SAU LEGISLATION OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTY YEARS. SUPERVISOR KINNEY HAN WHO'S A FORMER SUPERVISOR BROUGHT THE PARAMEDICS. FIRST STARTED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS SPREAD IT TO OTHER COUNTIES ARE BEST FIFTY YEARS AGO. IT'S TIME FOR A START UPDATING LOOKING AT NEW WAYS TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT EXISTS THAT CONFRONT US ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES AND ALSO THOSE WHO. IN FACT. WHO ARE? INEBRIATED AND SO THEY WILL BE TYING UP ARMORED SUIT ROPES AND SO I LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITHOUT ANYONE IS WILLING TO WORK WITH ME ON CHINA STRAIGHT AND MAKE THIS BILL THAT. THANK YOU. TO ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT. THE PILOT PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO TEST MANY DIFFERENT. CONCEPTS BASED ON THE NEEDS OF EACH COMMUNITY. I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION'S DESIRE FOR CLEAR STANDARDS AND TRAINING HOWEVER I THINK THE AUTHORS DID A GOOD JOB OF ENSURING OVERSIGHT THREE OUNCES ESTABLISHMENT GUIDELINES. AND WITH THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS WERE LOOKING THAT LICENSING FACILITIES WHICH I THINK WAS A CONCERN. OF YOUR DOCTOR. I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT APPROPRIATE THAT THE BILL STILL ALLOWS FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY ON THE PART OF LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES. I KNOW THAT. WHAT WORKS IN LOS ANGELES WON'T NECESSARILY WORK IN MY COUNTIES? AND AND AND I FLEXIBILITY IS IS IS CRITICAL. TO ME AND AND MY CONSTITUENTS SO WE'RE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GIPSON FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE THING I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE. THANK YOU. I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF BILLS BEFORE YOU BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FIVE VOTING THANK THOSE WHO. AND MY WILLINGNESS TO WORK AGAIN WITH ALL PARTIES THAT'S INVOLVED IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN AND MAKE THIS BILL BETTER SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I DON'T. THANK YOU MISTER GIPSON.

COVER THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION REPORTS OF ONE HOUR TWO HUNDRED BABIES ARE BORN WITH CMV SO THAT MEANS ONE OF TWO HUNDRED BABIES WILL LEAVE THE HOSPITAL IN ONE IN ONE THOUSAND. WILL COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN BABIES LIKE MY TWIN DAUGHTERS RIGHT LIAM RACHEL WHO EACH HAVE PROFOUND HEARING LOSS AND SEVERAL POLICY ADDITIONALLY MY DAUGHTER RACHEL. HOW PROFOUND VISION LOSS BREATHING ISSUES SEIZURES AND A FEEDING TUBE SHOE SEVERELY MEDICALLY FRAGILE AND SHE ULTIMATELY PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN? RALLIES HERE TODAY I'M HERE TODAY THE PROBLEM ON FAMILIES AND A LOT OF NOISY KIDS TODAY I'M AND WE WANT TO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE FOR AB ONE EIGHT OPEN BECAUSE INDEED SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT CMV AND LASTLY I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER NEEDS AREA. AND FOR HELPING TO OFFSET THE SPELLING BEE INTEGRATES PARKED WEST THINK YOU MOVE THE BILL. CHAIRMAN WOOD VICE CHAIR MAYES AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS YOUR MAMA AND I COME BEFORE YOU TODAY TO TESTIFY IN FAVOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN NO ONE. I'M AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY ALSO KNOWN AS E. N. T. AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY NETWORK AND LUCILLE PACKARD CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. I HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN CMB BECAUSE I TREAT CHILDREN WITH HEARING LOSS AND SEE A MOVIE. IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE AND CAN GENERAL HEARING LOSS. YET IT HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF AWARENESS AMONGST NOT ONLY MY PATIENTS BUT ALSO MY COLLEAGUES. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHO HAS CMV AS AN INFANT AND WE MISS THIS VALUABLE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR DIAGNOSIS. AS THE PEDIATRIC OTOLOGY LIST A DOCTOR WHO TREATS CHILDREN WITH HEARING LOSS AND DEAFNESS. IT CONTINUOUSLY SHOCKS AND SADDENS ME THAT WE ARE NOT DIAGNOSING THIS CONDITION. THAT CAUSES SUCH SEVERE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS PROFOUND DEAFNESS. WE ARE NOT BRINGING THE NECESSARY ATTENTION TO CMB AND INCREASING THE AWARENESS. CMB. NOW THE REASON THIS IS HAPPENING IS BECAUSE THIS VIRUS SHEDS EARLY IN THE IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF LIFE DURING INFANCY. AND IT CANNOT BE DETECTED LATER ON. THIS MEANS THAT A CHILD WHO PRESENTS TO MY CLINIC WITH HEARING LOSS AT THE AGE OF SIX WHO IS PROFOUNDLY DEAF. THEY WILL NEVER KNOW IF IT WAS FROM CMB. WE END UP WORKING UP THEIR HEARING LOSS WITH GENETIC TESTING MULTIPLE TO GENETIC TESTS CT SCANS AND MRIS. ALL WHICH COME BACK NORMAL HOWEVER WE WOULD THAT WE DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS CHILD HAS PROFOUND DEAFNESS. THESE CHILDREN WOULD NOT NEED THIS UNNECESSARY RADIATION. AND CONTRAST UNNECESSARY TESTING. IF THEIR CONDITION HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED IN THE THAT TIME APPROPRIATE FASHION. THIS IS THE PROBLEM IN IDENTIFYING THE INFECTION NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO TEST FOR WE DO HAVE THE TESTS. IT'S BECAUSE WE ARE MISSING KEY STEPS IN THE TIMELY DIAGNOSIS. THE COMMISSION PROPOSED BUY SIMPLY BELIEVES NO ONE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP AT OUR STATE AND ITS PROFESSIONALS BEGIN TO STUDY AND CONFRONT THE ISSUE OF CMP. IT'S THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF HAIR LOSS IN CHILDREN IT COSTS ARE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FUNDS BUT IT ALSO COSTS SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL.

AND AGAIN THANK YOU TO TO YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND. ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT I ACCEPT. AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY THREE AIMS TO CURTAIL PRESCRIPTION DRUG OVERPAYMENTS BEING REMITTED TO PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS. CONSUMERS ASSUME THAT THE VARIOUS DISCOUNTS NEGOTIATED BETWEEN. DRUG COMPANIES INSURANCE AND P. B. M.'S PROVIDE THE LOS PRESCRIPTION COSTS UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND THIS BILL. IS HERE TO ADDRESS THAT AND. WITH THAT I WILL TURN OVER. THIS THE MIKE TO. A MISS LEWIS HOME PRESIDENT AND CEO AND COFOUNDER OF THE CALIFORNIA. CHRONIC CARE COALITION AS WELL AS THE NET MENDELSSOHN SENIOR ATTORNEY AT CONSUMERS UNION THANK YOU. FOR HOW MUCH. BUT SOME. REMEMBER IT IS THERE YOU CAN HEAR ME. CHAIRMAN WOOD HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LIZ HOMES AND I PRESIDENT CEO OF THE CONFERENCE CHRONIC CARE COALITION. TODAY WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY THREE. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THE CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS OUR VIEWS REGARDING PBM PRACTICE OF CLAWBACK. I ALSO LIKE TO THANK CHAIRMAN WOULD ANY STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US SO CLOSELY ON THIS. THE FOUR SEASONS THE COALITION MORE THAN THIRTY LEADING STATEWIDE CONSUMER HEALTH ORGANIZATION IN PROVIDER GROUPS THAT PROMOTE THE COLLABORATIVE WORK. OF POLICYMAKERS INDUSTRY LEADERS PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. TOGETHER OUR ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENT MORE THAN SIXTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH ONE OR MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY THREE AIMS TO CURTAIL PRESCRIPTION DRUG OVERPAYMENT. AL ALSO KNOWN AS CLAWBACK WHEN COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS COPAYMENTS EXCEED THE TOTAL COST OF THE DRUG TO THEIR INSURANCE OR PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER. THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS ONLY NOW BEGINNING TO LEARN THAT THIS TYPE. CONSUMER PRACTICE EXISTS WE BELIEVE AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY THREE HAS THE SOLUTION TO HELP CONSUMERS. ONE IT WOULD LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF HEALTH CARRIER OR PBM MAY REQUIRE A BENEFICIARY TO PAY AT THE POINT OF SALE. FOR COVERED PRESCRIPTION TO THE LOWEST AVAILABLE COST WHETHER IT IS APPLICABLE COST SHARING AMOUNT OR THE RETAIL PRICE ENSURING CONSUMERS ARE NOT OVER PAIN FOR THEIR PRESCRIPTION MEDS. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE RETAIL PRICE INSTEAD OF JUST A CO PAY TO APPLY TOWARDS OUR DEDUCTIBLE AND OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM IF THE BENEFICIARY OPS TO PAY THE CASH PRICE. IN A RECENT STUDY DONE BY U. S. C. CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY IN ECONOMICS AND. IT ON MARCH THIRTEENTH PUBLICATION FROM KAISER HEALTH NEWS PATIENTS OVER PAY FOR PRESCRIPTIONS TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF THE TIME. IT CONTINUES TO STATE THE STUDY FOUND THAT TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF FILL PRESCRIPTIONS INVOLVE PATIENT CO PAY THAT EXCEEDED THE AVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT PAID BY THE ENSURE BY MORE THAN TWO DOLLARS SPENDING AN OUT OF POCKET COSTS. IN FACT ONE PBM SHOWED REVENUE OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION IN A PROFIT OF OVER FIVE BILLION WHILE TAKING LITTLE OR NO RISK WHEN THE REST OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN PARRIS ALL THE RISK. IT'S QUITE A PHENOMENON. OUR MISSION IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ARE ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN ACCESS APPROPRIATE QUALITY HEALTHCARE. AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY THREE WILL HELP TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS THROUGH BETTER ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE MEDICATIONS THEY DESPERATELY NEED. CONSUMER SHOULD ALWAYS POCKET ANY AVAILABLE SAVINGS ON THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING THE CHRONIC CARE COALITION TO EXPRESS OUR VIEWS TODAY. THE BLONDE. IT IS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME INCREMENTAL CINEMA SENIOR ATTORNEY AT CONSUMERS UNION THE ADVOCACY ARM OF CONSUMER REPORTS. FOR YEARS NOW CONSUMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED EXPONENTIAL GROWTH IN THE COSTS OF THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. INSURANCE COMPANIES PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS AND PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS. EACH POINT THEIR FINGERS AT EACH OTHER AND CERTAINLY THERE'S ENOUGH BLAME TO GO AROUND. WE BELIEVE THAT AB SIXTY THREE WERE TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARD TAKEN THE CONSUMER OUT FROM THE MIDDLE OF. CONSUMER PARTS OF LONG REPORTED ON HOW THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRIVE IT'S AFFECTING CONSUMERS. IN A RECENT SURVEY WE FOUND THE CONSUMERS WHO FACED THE DRUG PRICE HIKE IN THE PAST YEAR. HAD MADE UNTENABLE CHOICES. FOR EXAMPLE AFTER ONE METERED INSULIN COVERAGE CHANGE THE READER RATION HIS INSURANCE SUPPLY. A DRUG USED TO TREAT WHO TYPE ONE DIABETES. PENDING AN APPEAL ABOUT COVERAGE DECISION. EVEN AFTER A SUCCESSFUL APPEAL HE STILL HAD TO BORROW THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FROM HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY. IN ORDER TO AFFORD HIS CO PAY. WITH CONSUMERS STRUGGLE IF NOT HIS ALONE. IN OUR SURVEY WE FOUND THAT BECAUSE OF HIGH DRUG COSTS. RESPONDED FOR TAKING EXPIRED MEDICATION. DELAYING RETIREMENT AND TAKING SECOND JOBS. TROUBLING WAY ADDITION TO RATIONING THEIR OWN TREATMENT SOME CONSUMERS IT SIMPLY JUST CHOSE TO STOP PICKING THEIR MEDICATION. ON THE FLIP SIDE. CONSUMERS OF CONSUMERS HAVE FAITH THAT THE DRUG PRICE HIKE IN THE PAST YEAR. ONE OUT OF FIVE CONSUMER POST PHONE PAYING OTHER BILLS. IN A RECENT FEATURE ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE MAY TWENTY EIGHTEEN ISSUE OF CONSUMER REPORTS. WE GAVE CONSUMER PRACTICAL TIPS ON HOW TO PAY LESS FOR THEIR DRUGS. SUCH AS ASKING FOR GENERIC OR LOWER COST THERAPEUTIC ALTERNATIVE. AND ASKING FOR LOWEST PRICE ON ANY GIVEN DRUGS. THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN WHEN BIG COMPANY PROFITS WHILE CONSUMERS EVEN THOSE WITH INSURANCE. ARE LEFT PAYING HIGH PRICES FOR THE DRUG THAT THEY NEED. CONSUMERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO KNOW THE MAGIC WORD IN ORDER TO GET THE MOST AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. FURTHERMORE CONSUMER THAT DO THEIR RESEARCH AND GET THE LOWEST COST OPTION SHOULD NOT WIND UP FURTHER AWAY FROM ME IN THEIR DEDUCTIBLE AND OUT OF POCKET WOMEN. ESPECIALLY AFTER PAYING SO MUCH TO BE INSURED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT A BILL LIKE AB TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY THREE. WHICH PROHIBIT GUY CLAUSES AND CLAWBACK. AND PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING THE LOWEST COST PRICE POSSIBLE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG. THIS MAY BE THE RETAIL PRICE RATHER THAN THE COPAY. EXPANDING TOWARD THEIR DEDUCTIBLE AND OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM. I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER KNOW DARIEN FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL. AND INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME. AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR. OTHER SINCE SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOAN WHERE PLAN I AM CHAIR OF THE CHRONIC CARE COALITION AND I AM ALSO.

MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BEFORE I BEGIN I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE I PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR ON HIS STAFF OF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL I'LL ALSO REALLY WANTED TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANK YOU. TO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT TO PAULA. VELASQUEZ FOR ALL THE WORK SHE HAS DONE ON THIS BILL SO SO WELL I WANTED RECOGNIZE THAT I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO. ADDRESS ANY REMAINING CONCERNS AB NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR REVISES THE DEFINITION OF ORGANIZED CAMP TO INCLUDE BOTH ORGANIZED RESIDENT CAMPS AN ORGANIZED DAY CAMPS. TO ASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT DAY CAMPS OPERATE UNDER THE NECESSARY OVERSIGHT DAY CAMPS TYPICALLY OPERATE DURING THE SUMMER AND OTHER VACATION PERIODS WHEN SCHOOL IS NOT NORMALLY IN SESSION. AND PROVIDE GROUP BASED RECREATION AND EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN. CONSIDERATIONS OF COST AGE OF THE CHILD AND PARENTAL PREFERENCE ARE AMONG THE REASON SOME PARENTS PREFER TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN ATTEND LOCAL DAY CAMPS RATHER THAN REMOTE RESIDENT CAMP. ALTHOUGH MOST DAY CAMPS ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH THE HIGHEST OF SAFETY STANDARDS THERE IS VERY LITTLE REGULATION OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS ADDITIONALLY SINCE THERE IS NO REFERENCE TO DAY CAMPS AND CURRENT LAW REGULATION. THERE'S BEEN CONFUSION RELATED TO WHICH GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY HAS JURISDICTION OVER THEIR OPERATION IF ANY AT ALL THIS MEASURE WILL MAKE SURE THAT DAY CAMPS MEET THE SAME APPLICABLE STANDARDS APPLIED TO RESIDENT CAMPS. AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. ARE CATHARINE BURBANK IN THE PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR WITH CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION FOR USE AND MICHELLE BRANCH BRAND CON YEAH WITH AMERICAN CAMP ASSOCIATION. RIDLEY SCOTT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KATHY BURBANK IN CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION FOR YOUTH. I'M SURE YOU'VE OP YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH RESIDENT CAMP SHE PROBABLY GOT SHIPPED OFF TO ONE WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG SO YOUR PARENTS COULD HAVE A COUPLE WEEKS OF VACATION. BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY LESS FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THE ASSEMBLYMAN WAS TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF DAY CAMPS. DAY CAMPS PROVIDE THE SAME KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT A RESIDENT CAMP HAS WITH THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT THE KIDS DON'T SPEND THE NIGHT THEY GO HOME. I HAVE WITH ME MICHELLE RANK NEAR FROM THE AMERICAN CAMP ASSOCIATION SHE IS THE EXPERT EXTRAORDINAIRE ON ACCREDITATION STANDARDS FOR THE AMERICAN CAMP ASSOCIATION. AND DOES A LOT OF VISITS WITH THESE CAMPS ARE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS AND SHE'S HERE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. DAY CAMPS AND. HER JOB. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU. ON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MAYES I'M IN YOUR DISTRICT I LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA SO. IT'S NICE TO BE HERE. I ASKED THREE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THE AMERICAN CAMP ASSOCIATION DOES HAVE A VOLUNTARY ACCREDITATION PROGRAM REQUIRES DAY CAMPS TO ABIDE BY AS PROVISION OF ACCREDITATION THEY HAVE. A THEY ABIDE BY STATE COUNTY AND LOCAL LAWS ON IN THIS WORLD EXPAND THAT TO ALL CAMPS DAY CAMPS ARE ASKING FOR REGULATION THEY WANT TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE CAMPERS THAT THEY SERVE. ON. WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR AWHILE. AND AND WE REALLY DO WANT TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD THAT GOES TO CAMP IS SAFE. WHILE THEY'RE THERE. I. HUMBLY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHRIS SLEPT WARMLY WITH A CALIFORNIA STATE ALLIANCE OF YMCAS IN SUPPORT THINK. A MUCH. ANYONE ELSE. ANSWER ANYONE IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BUT YOU ARE STRONG ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION I WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON MAYBE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. ALONG WITH OUR HEALTH OFFICER COLLEAGUES AND ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. A. B. NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR SEEKS TO EXPAND THE EXISTING COUNTY REGULATORY OVERSIGHT FOR RESIDENT CAMPS TO NOW INCLUDE DAY CAMPS WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A COUNTIES TO OPERATE OUTSIDE OF OURS THEIR SCOPE OF EXPERTISE. BECAUSE OF THIS EXPANSION WE SOUGHT AMENDMENTS TO LIMIT OUR ROLE TO THE HEALTH AND SANITATION ASPECTS OF A DAY CAMP WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. AND THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US. ON THESE AMENDMENTS AND TO BELIEVE THAT THEY ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL AYE WHY WE BELIEVE THE BILL IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE TO A COUPLE THINGS ADDRESSED BEFORE WE CAN REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. FURTHER UP WE WOULD LIKE TO FURTHER REFINE THE DEFINITION OF A DAY CAMP TO PROVIDE CLARITY TO OUR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND WE'D LIKE TO CLARIFY THE ROLE OF LOCAL ENFORCEMENT IN THE ABSENCE OF A DAY CAMP HAVING A FACILITY OR A FIXED LOCATION. WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO RESOLVE THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES. WITH ME HERE TODAY IS. COUGH TO PROVIDE THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE HIS CORE ONE QUARTER PUBLIC ASSIST HEALTH ASSISTANT DIRECTOR AND FORMER ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR FROM SAN BERNADINO CAM. THANK YOU. AS I STATED MY NAME IS CARMEN PORTER ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN PUBLIC AND STAMINA DO YOU KNOW COUNTY AND A MEMBER OF GEAC. I WORKED IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR OVER TWENTY EIGHT YEARS TWENTY SIX YEARS. ABOUT TIME PERIOD WAS IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD FIFTEEN OF THOSE YEARS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH. CAMPS IN ONE CAPACITY OR ANOTHER. WE HAVE OVER SEVENTY ORGANIZE RESIDENT CAMPS THAT WE PERMIT AND INSPECT INSANITY YOU KNOW COUNTY WHICH AS A NOTICE THE MOST OF ANY JURISDICTION IN THE STATE. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO LIMIT OUR LOCAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY FOR DAY CAMPS TO HEALTH AND SANITATION. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALISTS WHO WILL ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL. WHEN I'LL NOW ONLY BE TASKED WITH ACTIVITIES WHICH THEY ARE TRAINED AND REGISTER TO DO. SUCH AS OVERSEEING FOOD PROTECTION DRINKING WATER QUALITY RECREATIONAL SWIMMING. AND SOLID WASTE. HOWEVER AB NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR STILL DOES NOT CLEARLY DEFINE WHAT IS A CAMPUS IN MAY AT HUNDREDS OF NEW CAMPS UNDER OUR OVERSIGHT. YOU'LL RECALL A MOMENT AGO I MENTIONED WE OVERSEE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF ORGANIZE CAMPS. pUNCLEAR WHETHER THIS BILL INCLUDES SPORTS CAMPS. ART AND CRAFT CAN'T STEM CAMPS THEATRE CAMPS RECREATIONAL WATER CAMPS AMONG MANY OTHER TYPES OF DAY CAMP PROGRAMS OFFERED. THIS FOR THE REST OF THE BURDEN OF THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT A DAY CAMP AND THE TO WHICH TEAR THEY WILL FALL. EVEN MORE DIFFICULT IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO ENFORCE REQUIREMENTS ON A DAY CAMP WITHOUT A FIXED LOCATION. OR THAT LACK OF PHYSICAL FACILIIES SUCH AS A PARKER BEACH. THE NEW WORKLOAD. PERMITTING AND FEE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE BURDENSOME MORE NOTABLY TO SMALLER JURISDICTIONS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. HELP CAN'T DIVERT HELP OFFICERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA IN ALIGNMENT WITH MY COUNTY COLLEAGUES. FARMER DATING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WE ESPECIALLY WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE WE ARE OPPOSE US AMENDED FOR THOSE TWO DETAILS MENTIONED THANK YOU. TO CHERISH JOINT OF OR SOMETHING OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO HAVE OPPOSE MUST AMENDED THAT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND WE BELIEVE THE BELLS FROM IN RIGHT DIRECTION. AND HOPE IT CONTINUES TO WORK ON AS AN FOR THANK YOU. KELLY BRICKS ON BEHALF OF THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. SHARING THE SAME CONCERNS AS MY COLLEAGUES AND THINKING AUTHOR VERY MUCH FOR ALL THE WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO MOTION A SECOND BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER MISTER MAYES. WHO ARE GOOD TO SEE THANK YOU COULD DECIDE TO? SO IT'S BEEN BEEN A FEW YEARS SINCE WE WORK TOGETHER. BUT I REMEMBER LET ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU AND I WOULD HAVE THAT COUNTY OFFICE WE TALK ABOUT FEES. WHAT THE IF THE SAME YOU COUNTY WAS GOING TO A BEGIN TO TO REGULATE AND GO OUT AND? AND INSPECTS OF THESE DAY CAMPS WHAT WHAT WHAT THE FEES LOOK LIKE IN THAT WITH THE FEES BE SO HIGH THAT THEY WOULDN'T THAT THEY'D THE DAY CAMPS WOULDN'T WHAT HAPPENED. IT IS HARD TO PREDICT. I WOULD ASSUME THAT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE DAY CAPS THAT WE CURRENTLY INSPECTORS A FEW YMCA CAMPS THAT VOLUNTARILY COME FORWARD AND ASK FOR INSPECTIONS. SO WILL BE STRUCTURED BASED ON THOSE AND THAT FEE WOULD BE BASED ON THE TIME TO ACTUALLY DO THAT INSPECTION. SO. IT'S HARD TO PREDICT WHAT THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT WILL BE AT THIS POINT BUT WILL DEFINITELY STUDY THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. XENA BRING BACK TO YOU MR MAIENSCHEIN WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WE'VE BEEN WHAT DO A LOT OF WORK WITH THAT. PEOPLE ON WHO HAVE WHO'VE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT TEST SHOULD THIS MOVE FORWARD. WE'VE WORKED OUT A LOT OF THE ISSUES I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO SO BUT I DO THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT FELL. FOR PEOPLE WHO FOR PARENTS TO DO SEND THEIR KIDS TO CAMP THEY MAY NOT FIT IN ALMOST SURELY DON'T KNOW WHAT A BUREAUCRATIC DEFINITION OF THESE CAMPS ARE. BUT WHAT THEY DO KNOW IS THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO BE SAFE WHILE THEY GO THERE AND THIS IS WHAT'S PARTICULAR IMPORTANT THING BUT THIS IS THE ENTRY INDUSTRY ITSELF IS ASKING TO BE REGULATED MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE. PROVIDING THE PROPER PROTECTION FOR FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND WHEN WE ENTRUST OUR KIDS TO THESE CAMPS I THINK WE ALL OF US AS PARENTS WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THAT BE SAFE THERE.

CENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS UNIT WHICH APPEARS TO BE OVERWHELMED AND UNDERSTAFFED HOSPITALS ARE NOW EXPERIENCING EXTREMELY LONG WAIT TIMES FOR APPLICATION APPROVALS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS QUOTES CDP H. HAS ESTIMATED THAT CURRENTLY TAKE SIX TO NINE MONTHS. FOR APPLICATIONS TO BE ASSIGNED TO AN ANALYST. AN ADDITIONAL FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS TO APPROVE THE APPLICATION IN THE COMPLETE AN ON SITE INSPECTION IF NEEDED. REGARDLESS OF THE EXACT TIME FRAME WE CAN ALL AGREE IT IS TAKING FAR TOO LONG THE BACKLOG IT'S REACHED THE POINT OF ENDANGERING THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS. DELAYS IN APPROVING THESE APPLICATIONS MEANS THAT PATIENTS LACK ACCESS TO CRITICAL AND SOMETIMES LIFESAVING SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE ONE HOSPITAL WAITED OVER SIX MONTHS TO EXPAND ITS EXISTING CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LABORATORY. DURING THE WAY THE TWO ADDITIONAL BATS REMAINED EMPTY AND NINE ONE ONE AMBULANCES HAD TO FIND ANOTHER HOSPITAL WITH AN OPEN CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION BAD. THAT'S DELAYING THE TREATMENT OF THOSE PATIENTS ANOTHER HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WAITED SIX MONTHS FOR DPH APPROVE A NEW MRI CENTER AND WAS FORCED TO TRANSPORT ILL PATIENTS IN AN AMBULANCE TO A DISTANT FACILITY. SIMPLY BECAUSE DPH HAD NOT COMPLETED ITS REVIEW TO APPROVE A NEW MRI CENTER WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY EIGHT ARE DAN GROSS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT. OF HOSPITAL OFFERS OPERATE OPERATIONS FOR SHARP HEALTHCARE AND DEBBIE ROGERS FROM CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION MOVE THE BILL. GIVE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS W.

HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO PROVIDE INPUT AND PERSPECTIVE ON AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY EIGHT. MY THOUGHTS ARE GROUNDED IN MORE THAN FOUR DECADES OF HEALTH CARE EXPERIENCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND NUMEROUS ARE A COLLEAGUE AND PUT AS I TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND LISTEN ACTRESS INDIVIDUAL SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE. FIRST I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE CHALLENGES AN UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCES OF PROBLEMATIC CENTRALIZE APPLICATIONS UNIT ALL REFER TO IT AS CA YOU HERE I AFTER. AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF THE CA YOU IT BEGAN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND YEAH HAD FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN TWENTY SEVENTY. THIS CA YOU ASSUMED MANY OF THE STATE LICENSING IN FEDERAL CERTIFICATION RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DECENTRALIZED THROUGHOUT THE STATE INTO OUR VARIOUS DISTRICTS. THE GOAL OF THE CA YOU WISH TO STANDARDIZE LICENSING PROCESS FEES TO CREATE STANDARDIZATION AND TO IMPROVE CONSISTENCY INEFFICIENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO SUPPORT HEALTH CARE DELIVERY FOR ALL OF OUR CITIZENS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. UNFORTUNATELY THE CA YOU HAS NOT ACHIEVED ITS INTENDED GOALS. INSTEAD IT HAS PRODUCED UNREASONABLE CONSEQUENTIAL DELAYS IN THE LICENSING OF VITAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE END TIMELY LICENSING OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS RESULTED IN DIMINISH CARE DELIVERY TO PATIENTS. CREATE A GREAT FRUSTRATION FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND THE LOCAL CDP EIGHT STAFF. AND SADLY ENOUGH THE NEED TO ASK YOU EIGHT MANY OF THESE ISSUES TO ARE YOU IN THIS ROOM AS WELL AS TOP EXECUTIVES IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DIVISION. CURRENT LICENSING DELAYS IS NOT OF LOCALIZED ISSUED OUR CONCERN IT'S A STATEWIDE ISSUE AND CONCERN. PRESENTLY IS TAKING MONTHS OFTEN UP TO A YEAR TO LICENSE NEW OR SIMPLY EXPAND SERVICES WITHIN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION TO THE EXAMPLE THAT ASSEMBLYMAN.

WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY IS TAKING EIGHT MONTHS TOGETHER I'M URGENCY DEPARTMENT BLOOD DRAW STATION. LA APPLICATION PROCESS AND WE HAD THREE. HOSPICE HOUSES THAT HAVE TAKEN EIGHT TO ELEVEN MONTHS EACH TO BE OUR AYE LICENSE THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR INDULGING ME I DO HAVE WITNESSES THAT HAVE TO FLY OUT SO APPRECIATE THE. OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. THANK YOU I TODAY I AM HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE SEVENTY FIVE A BILL WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THAT CERTIFIED CHILD LIFE SPECIALIST BE INCLUDED IN ALL PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT HOSPITAL UNITS. IN OUTPATIENT SPECIALTY CLINICS. CERTIFIED LIFE SPECIALISTS HELP THOUGH IN ILL INJURED DYING CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES NAVIGATE CHALLENGING AND LIFE ALTERING HEALTH HELLO HEALTHCARE CRISIS. MEDICAL TRAUMA THREATS TO LONG TERM WELL BEING AND THE POTENTIAL FOR DEATH AFFECTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE MEDICAL TEAMS THAT SERVE THESE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES RIGHTLY FOCUS ON THE RESTORATION OF PHYSICAL WELL BEING OF THE NO CHILD. THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND FAMILY WELL BEING OF THESE CHILDREN GENERALLY FALLS INTO THE SCOPE OF SERVICES OF CHILD LIFE SPECIALISTS. THE SPECIALISTS ARE ALLIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS THAT SERVE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES NAVIGATE NAVIGATING HEALTHCARE CRISIS IS THAT HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE AND WELL BEING. TO THEIR PATIENTS. CHILD LIFE SERVICES. HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE. SEDATION RELATED COSTS USE OF PAIN MEDICATION AND LENGTH OF HOSPITALIZATIONS. THEY ALSO HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE PATIENT AND FAMILY CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HEALTH GOOD HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY STANDARDS ENDORSED THE VALUE OF CHILD LIKE SERVICES BITE HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF CONSSTENTLY MANDATING DRIVE THEIR AVAILABILITY. TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES BY PASSING THIS LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE NATION IMPROVING THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENTALAND FAMILY WELL BEING OF CHILDREN. SUFFERING FROM SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS. SINCE THIS IS A NEW MANDATE I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS REMOVING THE STAFFING RATIO IN THE BILL AS WELL. AS THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS AND SECTION ONE OF THE BILL. WITH HERE. HERE WITH ME TODAY. I HAVE CHARITY BASKETS DIRECTOR OF THE INVEST CHILD LIFE PROGRAM OF THIS IS A PACIFIC UNIVERSITY AND CAPTURING EKLUND AT DEPARTMENT OF CYCLE OF. PSYCHOLOGY CHAIR AT THIS IS ABSURD MOVING. MOTION. YEAH. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHARITY FUSCUS. AS A CERTIFIED HOLLOW SPECIALISTS FOR MORE THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS. I AM HERE TO EXPRESS MY ARM SUPPORT FOR THIS WHOLE ESPECIALLY ILL A. B. THIRTY ONE SEVENTY FIVE. THROUGHOUT THE MEDICAL PUBLIC POLICY SOCIAL SERVICES EDUCATIONAL AND JUSTICE COMMUNITIES THERE IS INCREASING AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF TRAUMA AND ADVERSE EXPERIENCES IN CHILDHOOD. IN SHAPING ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS OUTCOMES ACROSS VIRTUALLY EVERY DOMAIN OF LIFE FUNCTIONING. THIS COLLECTIVE CONSENSUS WAS REFLECTED IN THE PATH THIS ABOUT OF ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FORTY THIS PAST OCTOBER. TRAUMATIC INJURIES AND SERIOUS ILLNESSES IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS ARE SOCIO A SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED RATE OF PERSISTENT POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AN EVEN HIGHER RATES OF LINGERING EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS. CHILD LIFE SPECIALISTS LEAD THE EFFORT TO PREVENT THESE OUTCOMES BY CREATING A HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS SAFE. SECURE AND COMPREHENSIBLE IN THE MIDST OF WHAT IS OFTEN A PAINFUL CHAOTIC AND TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE. PACIFIC EDUCATION A UNIQUE TRAINING RECEIVED BY SALAS SPECIALISTS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE. PSYCHOSOCIAL THERAPEUTIC AND DEVELOPMENTAL SUPPORT INTERVENTIONS ARE NOT DELIVERED IN THE SAME WAY BY ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE HEALTHCARE TEAM. RESEARCH CONTINUE TO SHOW FINANCIAL BENEFIT OF FACILITIES THAT EMPLOY TELL A SPECIALIST. THE CURRENT EXISTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE CALIFORNIA TRIAL SERVICES PROGRAM TO OFFER A CHILD LIFE'S SERVICES. LIMIT CHILD LIFE SPECIALISTS PRESIDENT'S TO PROVIDE VALUABLE SERVICES AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WHICH CANNOT ONLY EXACERBATE INCIDENTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND TRAUMA BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY LENGTHY HEALING AND. RECOVERY PROCESS TO TANGIBLY IMPROVE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE NEXT GENERATION IT IS IMPORTANT TO MANDATE AND REVISED LEGISLATION. TO EXPAND AND REQUIRE SERVICES BY CALLASPO SHOELESS. I HUMBLY AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL A. B. THIRTY ONE SEVEN FIVE AND HELP INFANT CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES AFFECTED BY CRISIS HOSPITALIZATION TERMINAL AND CHRONIC ILLNESS OBTAIN. THE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE THE NEED TO LIVE THEIR BEST AND MOST FULFILLED LIFE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSERVING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR MOVING US UP SO WE CAN NOT MISS OUR PLANE. I MY NAME IS KATE DOCTOR CATHERINE ECHLIN I'M A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST WHO SPECIALIZES IN WORKING WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. ON I'M ALSO CLINICAL EDUCATOR I'VE EDUCATED A CHILD PSYCHIATRIST CHILD PSYCHOLOGISTS ON SOCIAL WORKERS MF CHEESE AND CHILD LIFE SPECIALISTS IN MY ROLE IN ACADEMIA CLINICAL ACADEMIA. I AM ALSO THE MOTHER OF A CHILD WITH A CHRONIC ILLNESS I'M HERE TO SUPPORT OF LEGISLATION FOR A. B. THIRTY ONE SEVENTY FIVE. CHAU LIFE SERVICES PROVIDING UNIQUE AREA OF EXPERTISE THAT FILLS AN IMPORTANT GAP IN THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY CHILD AND FAMILY CENTER TEAM. WHILE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ARE TENDING TO THE PHYSICAL WELL BEING OF A CHILD AND ALLIED HEALTH SPECIALISTS IS SET SUCH AS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AND SPEECH THERAPISTS. ARE TENDING TO THE PHYSICAL AND ADAPTIVE NEEDS OF THE CHILD CHILD LIFE SPECIALISTS FUNCTION TO PROVIDE PREVENTIVE AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES THAT FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON MAINTAINING. PSYCHOLOGICAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENTAL AND INTER PERSONAL WELL BEING DURING THE COURSE OF TREATMENT FOR HEALTH CONDITIONS. CHILD LIFE SPECIALIST INTERVENTIONS INCLUDE DEVELOPMENTALLY TARGETED CHILD AND PARENT EDUCATION AND PREPARATION FOR MEDICAL PROCEDURES REAL TIME SUPPORT DURING MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND PROCESSING. AND IMMEDIATE POST TRAUMA DEBRIEFING AND PROCESSING WITH CHILDREN GOING THROUGH MEDICAL ON THOMAS AS A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST WHO SPECIALIZES IN WORKING WITH CHILDREN FAMILIES HAVE EXPERIENCED A WIDE RANGE OF TRAUMA. MY TRAINEE DID NOT PREPARE ME TO PROVIDE THESE IMMEDIATE REAL TIME. HAD MEDICAL RELATED SERVICES ON HOWEVER IN OUTPATIENT SETTINGS OVER THE COURSE OF MY CAREER I'VE SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME WITH CHILDREN FAMILIES. WHO SECONDARY TO SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT FOR SERIOUS ILLNESSES HAVE DEVELOPED A VARIETY OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT AFFECTED PSYCHOLOGICAL EMOTIONAL RELATIONAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL WELL BEING? WHEN I ENCOUNTER FAMILIES THAT ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF NAVIGATING HEALTH CRISES OF THEIR CHILDREN I ALWAYS RECOMMEND THEY REQUEST CHILDLIKE SERVICES AND MORE TIMES THAN NOT. CHUDLEIGH SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE HEALTH CARE SETTINGS THAT THEY ARE SERVED IN. THIS LACK OF ACCESS TO TIMELY SERVICES CONCERNING TO ME. AS A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST IT'S ALWAYS OUR GOAL TO INCREASE THE WELL BEING OF COMMUNING DE MEMBERS SUCH TO MAKE OUR SERVICES UNNECESSARY. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WITH THE PROVISION OF CHILD LIFE SERVICES THE NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH REFERRALS FOR CHILDREN IMPACTED BY HEALTH CONDITIONS TO OUTPATIENT PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES. TO ADDRESSED ECONDARY ANXIETY BEHAVIORAL AND EMOTIONAL DYSREGULATION AND DEVELOPMENT ON SOCIAL DELAYS WILL DECLINE. ADEN SO AB THAT I'M RUNNING ATTEMPT AND A. B. THIRTY ONE SEVENTY FIVE CAN INITIATE THE PROCESS OF INCLUSION OF CHILDLIKE SERVICES ISN'T ENOUGH INTEGRAL HEALTH INTERVENTION FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. CALIFORNIA WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB THIRTY ONE SEVENTY FIVE WILL SERVE AS A MODEL FOR A MOVEMENT FROM ADVOCACY TOWARD ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES. AND THE PREVENTION OF LONG TERM DEFICITS IN CHILDREN. WELT CHILDREN CHILD WELL BEING THAT CAN BE UNINTENDED BYPRODUCTS OF CHILDHOOD ILLNESSES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL. YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS TO SUPPORT. SEEN NO ONE WILL. IS THERE IS A OPPOSITION. YOU COME UP IF YOU LIKE. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS WE ARE MORE EAR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. MY EIGHT NONPROFIT FREESTANDING CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS ARE STRONG PROPONENTS OF CHILD LIFE SERVICES I'M ALL OF OUR HOSPITALS EMPLOY CHILD LIFE SPECIALISTS. AND ABSOLUTELY BUT AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THE PROPONENTS SAID ABOUT THE VALUE THAT THEY PROVIDE TO THE CHILDREN THAT WE SERVE. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A REIMBURSABLE US THAT OUR WHOLE OUR HOSPITALS PROVIDED SOMETHING THAT THEY DO AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE BECAUSE THEY SEE THAT HAS A BENEFIT FOR CHILDREN AND AS A RESULT. WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT ATTEMPTING TO MANDATE A SERVICE THAT IS NOT CORRECT CARE. AREN'T ANY SERVICE REALLY WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO DICTATE THE PRIORITIES THAT HOSPITAL FACES WHEN IT'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST MANAGE ITS RESOURCES. I THINK WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY TO. ELIMINATE THE STAFFING RATIO HOWEVER THE BILL IN KIND OF ALL OF ITS ASPECTS STILL MANDATE REQUIRING THAT YOU HAVE CHILD LIFE SPECIALISTS IN ALL SETTINGS. OUR SPECIALTY CARE IS PROVIDED AND ALL DAYS OF THE WEEK AGAIN MANY OF OUR HOSPITALS PROVIDE CHILD LIFE SPECIALISTS AND CHILDLESS SERVICES IN SETTINGS FAR BEYOND WHAT THEY'RE RQUIRED TO DO NOW. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT OF THE MANDATED APPROACH FOR AN UNREIMBURSED SERVICE IS. IS RISKY ESPECIALLY AT A TIME OVER ASKING PROVIDERS TO BILLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE OTHER SERVICES MORE AFFORDABLE AND TO BE MORE LEAN SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST OPPOSE. HOWEVER THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY WE DO A COMMIT TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO SEE IF WE CAN RESOLVE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. THANK YOU. ROBERT LAZAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WHEAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THE BILL THE SAME CONCERNS THAT MISS MORTON MORTON POINTED OUT. I'M HOWEVER WERE PLEASED TO SEE THE AUTHOR HAS REMOVED THE RATIOS THAT WAS PROBABLY OUR TOP CONCERN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. WELL IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO PRE BACKED COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE ROOM COMMITTEE. SEEING THEM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THIS RUBIO. THANK YOU YES I AM A. B. THIRTY ONE SEVEN FIVE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD TO ESTABLISHING CALIFORNIA THE STANDARD BEARER. FOR THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF ITS CONSTITUENTS BY M. OF HUNDRED PERCENT COMMITTED OUGHT TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON FUNDING ISSUES OF THE BILL MOVES THROUGH THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. VERY MUCH WE DO HAVE A MOTION. FOR. BY MISTAKE YEAR CURRY WERE LOOKING FOR A SECOND. THE SECOND BY MISTER MCCARTY.

THE BILL BECAUSE HIS FACE UP THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO MOVE UP IN THE. DON'T MAKE ME THINK THEM SO MANY. MISTER PATTERSON. PATTERSON HAS A. B. TWENTY TWO HUNDRED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY MEMBERS. ARE A. B. TWENTY TWO HUNDRED WILL REQUIRE ALL EMPLOYEES AT LICENSED. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT FACILITIES TO UNDERGO A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK. THIS BACKGROUND CHECK WILL THEN BE REVIEWED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND APPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT THE FACILITY. MAY BE APPROVED OR DENIED BASED ON THE BACKGROUND CHECK RESULTS. ACQUIRING BACKGROUND CHECKS WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS OF SUBSEQUENT ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS. AS. OUT PROMOTION IT IS OUT. AS WE'VE SEEN MANY TIMES THE NEWS EVEN A TWO REPORTS PUBLISHED BY THE LEGISLATURE THIS LAPSE IN OVERSIGHT BY THE STATE HAS RESULTED IN NEGATIVE OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS AT THESE FACILITIES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE TOOK A LOOK AT THESE PROBLEMS WITH INDUSTRY PROPOSED. FIXES ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CERTAINLY CAUGHT OUR EYE AS NECESSARY WAS TO MANDATE BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR ADDICTION. COUNSELORS THIS BILL TAKES THAT RECOMMENDATION APPLIES IT TO EMPLOYEES WORKING AT RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT US WHEN ANDERSON FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT. PARENTS AND ADDICTS IN NEED. CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY THIS AFTERNOON.

AYE I DO BELIEVE THAT THE BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE CRITICAL TO THE SAFETY OF OF NOT ONLY THE CLIENTS THEMSELVES BUT. TO THE TREATMENT FACILITY. I BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THAT TREATMENT CENTER. AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO PROTECT ITS OWNERS AND ALL ITS EMPLOYEES. YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S% WE'VE HAD ENOUGH BAD PUBLICITY GOING ON HERE IN THE LAST FEW FEW YEARS. WITH TREATMENT AND THIS IS IN MY OPINION GOING TO SHOW THE PUBLIC. THAT THAT WE MEAN BUSINESS AND THAT WE DO NEED TO CHANGE SOME POLICIES IN OUR IN OUR TREATMENT CENTERS AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE THIS AFTERNOON SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE TIME.

I ACTUALLY BELIEVE I HAVE FOR MR CHAIRMAN ONE ON CONSENT WHAT PRINT I CAN'T COUNT VERY WELL SO ANYWAY MORE THAN ONE ON CONSENT. SO. WE WILL START WITH. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. IF IT PLEASES THE CHAIR IS THERE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO PRESENT AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE FIRST AS I HAVE SOMEONE PRESENTING WAS A FLIGHT TO CATCH. YEAH I THINK WE CAN DO THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO REPORT TOTAL PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL EXPENDITURES. INCLUDING THE PERCENTAGE OF MEDICAL EXPENSES ALLOCATED TO PRIMARY CARE. COMPARED TO OVERALL MEDICAL EXPENDITURES. AS WELL AS THE METHOD PLANS AND INSURERS USED FINANCIALLY SUPPORT PRIMARY CARE. ONE OF THE BARRIERS TO ACCESSING HEALTHCARE IS THE LACK OF PRIMARY CARE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND THE HEAVY DEPENDENCE ON SPECIALIST SOMETHING THAT YOU YOURSELF MISTER CHAIR OF FREQUENTLY SAID. IS THAT IN THE UNITED STATES APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF PHYSICIANS ARE SPECIALISTS. AND APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD ARE IN PRIMARY CARE. THIS STATISTIC IS REFLECTED IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR LACK OF THE RULE BEST PRIMARY CARE WORK FORCE. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND CONTINUITY OF CARE THERE NEEDS TO BE A STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE AND ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS IN DOING THIS. IS HAVING TRANSPARENCY IN THE EXISTING PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL EXPENDITURES. REQUIRING HEALTH PLANS INSURERS TO REPORT TOTAL PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL EXPENDITURES WILL ALLOW CONSUMERS AND CARRIERS TO BE AWARE OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON PRIMARY CARE. AND TO BE MOTIVATED TO INCREASE THEIR SPENDING HAS SEEN IN OREGON WHERE SIMILAR LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED. IN ADDITION TO TRANSPARENCY THIS BILL WILL CREATE A PRIMARY CARE PAYMENTS REFORM COLLABORATIVE WITH HEALTH CARE STAKEHOLDERS. TO PROVIDE HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS WITH PROVEN STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT PRIMARY CARE WHICH WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE A HIGH VALUE HEALTH SYSTEM THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE A RIGHT TO. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OR DR KARLA TUCKER TO ME AS WELL AS JODY HEX FROM CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF. OR RYAN SPENCER. I'M OF THE. MOVE THE BILL. SECOND. WHO HAVE MOTION A SECOND? RYAN SPENCER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS HAD SPONSORED THE BILL OBVIOUSLY IN SUPPORT A TO MY RIGHT IS DOCTOR CARL THE COOK A TINY. KAKUTANI SHE IS THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR OF THE ACADEMY AND SHOULD BE THE ONE PROVIDING TESTIMONY. IF YOU. THANK YOU. AMOS A DOCTOR CARL* TANIYAMA FAMILY PHYSICIAN PRACTICING IN A WINTERS CALIFORNIA AND FULL DISCLOSURE I DON'T HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH BUT I HAVE A SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS BIRTHDAY TODAY. THE PORTION OF OUR HEALTHCARE DOLLAR GOING TO PRIMARY CARE IS NOT WELL KNOWN AND IT SHOULD BE. WE NEED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF PRIMARY CARE INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE. WE KNOW THAT A WELL FUNCTIONING HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WITH THE ROBUST PRIMARY CARE FOUNDATION DELIVERS A HIGHER QUALITY. HIGHER QUALITY CARE AT A LOWER COST AND WE KNOW THAT THAT PRIMERICA OUR FOUNDATION WITH ADEQUATE RESOURCES. ALLOWS FOR THE DELIVERY OF RIGHT CARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE SHARE OF SPENDING ON PRIMARY CARE IS A CRITICAL MEASURE OF HOW STRONG THAT PRIMARY CARE FOUNDATION IS. BUT IN VIRTUALLY US HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. NATIONAL UTILIZATION OF PRIMARY CARE. IS DECREASING AND UTILIZATION ESPECIALLY SERVICES CLIMBING AT AN ALARMING RATE. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A SMART WAY TO RUN A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BUT WE CAN'T CHANGE WHAT WE. WHAT WE DON'T MEASURE? SO AB TWENTY NINETY FIVE ALLOWS FOR THE GATHERING OF A DATE AND IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF OREGON IN RHODE ISLAND THAT'S SHOWING US HOW TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE. OF THOSE STATES HAVE FOUND THAT JUST HAVING THE DATA AVAILABLE IS CHANGING HOW HEALTH PLANS INSURANCE APPROACH THE PROBLEM. THEY HAVE. TACKLE THE TECHNICAL ISSUE OF COLLECTING THE DATA IN VARIOUS WAYS EITHER THROUGH HAVING A REGULATOR OR STATE DEPARTMENT COLLECT THE DATA AND ANALYZE IT OR USING AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE. WE EXPECT THAT THE COLLABORATIVE THAT SET UP IN THIS BILL WILL GUIDE US TO A FORMAT THAT WORKS BEST FOR CALIFORNIA. WE'VE DONE GREAT WORK TOGETHER IN CALIFORNIA ON IMPROVING ACCESS AND COVERAGE. BUT NOW WE HAVE TO BEGIN THE WORK OF RESHAPING HOW WE. DELIVER THE CARE TO CREATE A MORE SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA CAN ACHIEVE MORE AFFORDABLE CARE WITH BETTER OUTCOMES BY CONSISTENTLY MEASURING AND SUSTAINING SYSTEM WIDE INVESTMENT IN PRIMARY CARE. WE WILL NOT SEE FUNDAMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM UNTIL WE MAKE IT MORE PRIMARY CARE ORIENTED AND WE CAN START THIS PROCESS BY PASSING AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. VERY MUCH. HIS SUPPORTERS WERE. MARRIAGE IMPLORES ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. BUT IS IT SUPPORT. SEEING NO ONE IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS IN OPPOSITION TO TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE. BECAUSE IT WILL RESULT IN A NEW ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON HEALTH PLANS FOR THE COLLECTION OF DATA. THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ASSEMBLE. THESE NEW ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. HAS ALWAYS WILL TRANSLATE INTO YOU I'M HIGHER COSTS FOR CONSUMERS. THERE WAS LAST WEEK WE DEBATED A BILL. BY SIMPLY MEMBER ARAMBULA THAT WAS PREDICATED ON THE NOTION THAT THERE IS TOO MUCH ADMINISTRATIVE COST ON IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY ON THE HEALTH SIDE PART OF THE EQUATION. PARADOXICALLY THIS WEEK WE ARE DISCUSSING A BILL AB TWENTY NINETY FIVE ADDS EVEN MORE ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS ON MY MEMBER HEALTH PLANS. BUT SETTING ASIDE THIS ISSUE OF OVERALL POLICY DIRECTION A WE FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE THAT THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE ANY VALUABLE INFORMATION. REPORTING THAT HEALTH PLAN EXPECT MORE LESS ON PRIMARY CARE THAN HEALTH PLAN WHY. WILL NOT PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH WITH MUCH USEFUL INFORMATION. AND THE INFORMATION IF MY MEMBERS CAN ASSEMBLY FROM THE PROVIDER GROUPS. WITH ANY ACCURACY I'M IS QUALIFIED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS. ON IS THAT DO YOU MAY SEE LICENSE ENTITY BASED ON AN HMO OR PPO CHASSIS. CANYON ROWLY SULFUR FOR THEMSELVES DIRECTLY TO A SPECIALIST. BOB DOES THE PLAN PAY ON A CLAIMS BASIS ARE CAPITATED RATE. WHAT IS THE HEALTH ACUITY OF THE POPULATION THAT THE HEALTH PLAN IS SERVING? ON AND OTHER FACTORS THAT DRIVE A PRIMARY CARE VERSUS SPECIALIST CONSUMPTION. BUT EVEN A. BIGGER IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS HE ISSUE OF HOW WE WILL OBTAIN OR HOW MY MEMBERS WOULD A TEENY INFORMATION. ON CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE MARKET IS LARGELY BASED ON A CAPITATED BASIS NOT FEE FOR SERVICE. SO THIS MEANS THAT PLANS GENERALLY DO NOT PAY ON A CLAIMS BY CLAIMS BASIS ON THE PAPER PROVIDER GROUPS ON A PER MEMBER PER MONTH BASIS. IN THOSE GROUPS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING PATIENT CARE DIRECTLY. AND MANAGE MANAGING THE CAPITATED PAYMENT AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE SO MUCH OF THE INFORMATION ON DIRECT HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES ON EXISTS AT THAT LEVEL. THIS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE BILL THE HEALTH PLANS MUST SURVEY THEIR PROVIDER GROUPS FOR THE INFORMATION. AND THE RATE OF RESPONSE BY PROVIDERS WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE HEALTH CLAIM CAN PERFORM ACCURATE COMPLETE SURVEY OF SERVICES PERFORMED IN PAID. HEALTH ONE DATA REQUESTS ARE NOT PARTICULARLY POPULAR AMONG A CONTRACTED PROVIDERS. THE DOCTORS GENERALLY DO NOT WANT THE HMO IN THEIR OFFICE. AS SUCH PROVIDER RESPONSIVENESS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM THAT OUR PLANS OF EXPERIENCE BUYER MEMBERS WHEN ATTEMPTING TO COMPLY WITH REPORTING MANDATES. WEATHER IS COMPLYING WITH THE PROVIDER DIRECTORY LAW TIMELY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS ARE RELEVANT MEDI CAL INFORMATION FOR RATE DEVELOPMENT. WHEN PROVIDERS ARE NON RESPONSIVE IT BECOMES MORE ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME ON THE PLAN TO ENSURE ACCURACY BECAUSE THE PLANS MOST FREQUENTLY FOLLOW UP WITH THEIR CONTRACT PROVIDER GROUPS. SO IN RECOGNITION OF THIS PROBLEM PRIOR LEGISLATION. DOES A AND I'M THINKING SPECIFICALLY OF THE PROVIDER DIRECTORY LEGISLATION FROM A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. ACTUALLY ALLOWS PLANS TO DELAY PAYMENT TO PROVIDER PROVIDER GROUP IS IF THERE IS A FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO TO. COMPLETE THE DIRECTORIES THERE IS NO EQUIVALENT FEATURE HERE. FINALLY THE BILL CREATES AN ENTIRELY NEW GOVERNMENT COLLABORATIVE TO GOVERN THE TYPE OF PRIMARY CARRIED OUT OF THE PLANS WOULD REPORT. THIS COLLABORATIVE WOULD BE AFTER THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON THE PLANS OF ALREADY KICKED IN. WHICH MEANS THAT THE STANDARDS COULD CHANGE DOWN THE LINE IF IN SHORT A WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL TAKE. STEPHANIE WATKINS ON BEHALF OF THIS VISION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE TOO ARE OPPOSED TO THE BELL I'M UNFORTUNATELY WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS AND INTEREST IN THIS AREA IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US WHAT BENEFIT THIS INFORMATION WOULD PROVIDE. ESPECIALLY IN CONTEXT OF THE PPO WHERE THE ENSURE THEMSELVES CAN SELF REFER AND CHOOSE TO GO TO A SPECIALIST DIRECTLY VERSUS GOING TO A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. SO OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT IF YOU COLLECT THIS INFORMATION AND PUBLISH IT WHAT REAL BENEFIT pOTHER THAN ADDITIONAL COSTS WOULD PROVIDE TO CONSUMER AND COMPARING THAT. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE PPO TO CHOOSE THEMSELVES TO SEEK CARE THROUGH A SPECIALIST EAT. TO COMPARE PLAN TO PLAN IT WOULD ALSO IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT CONTRACT RATES IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO REALLY GARNER AS A CONSUMER A LACK OF INVESTMENT THAT THE PPL HAD IN THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. BECAUSE DEPENDING ON WHERE WE WHAT REGIONS THERE AND WHAT CONTRACT RATES THEY PAY YOU MIGHT SEE DISPROPORTIONATELY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT THEY'RE REPORTING WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ACTUALLY THE VALUE OF WHAT THEY PUT THEIR. FOR THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. SO WE ARE ADDITIONALLY WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. UNDER THE REGULATIONS YOU CAN APPOINT YEAR OLD BE I'M AN INTERNIST OTHER PROVIDERS THAT ARE SPECIALIST AS YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THAT WOULD NECESSARILY BE REPORTED BUT CERTAINLY IT CAN BE DEBT ADDITIONALLY SKEW THOSE NUMBERS THAT YOU MIGHT SEE IF YOU HAVE A EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH SENIOR OB.

MISTER DOCTOR VAN GOGH YOU HAVE A NOW BEFORE IS AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FIVE THAT. KRISTIN YES ARE. GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME GOOD THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FIVE REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ESTABLISH A QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND AND. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDED BY MANAGED CARE PLANS AND TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES. EXISTING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS ARE NOT STANDARDIZED ACROSS PLANS AND DO NOT REQUIRE SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS. PLANTS THAT FAILED TO MEET MINIMUM STANDARDS FACE RELATIVELY WEAK CONSEQUENCES. BUT HAVE DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN NEED PROPER HEALTH CARE AND ARE RELYING ON IT. WELL D. H. CS HAS MADE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SERVICES DELIVERED BY SHOW THE PROGRESS ANTICIPATED BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. MEANWHILE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF CALIFORNIANS RELYING ON MEDI CAL FALLS FURTHER BEHIND TO THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET. AND WIDESPREAD DISPARITIES IN RACE AND ETHNICITY PROCESSED. THIS BILL WILL ESTABLISH A NEW MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL SET TO THE BOTTOM QUARTILE OF MEDICAID PLANS PERFORMANCE NATIONWIDE. SPECIFIC STANDARDS WILL BE DETERMINED BY A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT DRIVES QUALITY AND REDUCES HEALTH DISPARITIES. FURTHERMORE THIS BILL WILL ESTABLISH FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO REWARD MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT MEET PERFORMANCE TARGETS THAT EXCEED THE NEW MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL AND ALSO INCLUDES A DEFINITION OF HEALTH DISPARITIES. AS PART OF ALL CONTRACTS WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT GOES BEYOND GENDER RACE ETHNICITY AND LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY TO OTHER FACTORS FOR WHICH THERE IS PEER REVIEWED EVIDENCE. OF HEALTH DISPARITIES INCLUDING GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS SUCH AS RURAL AREAS LIKE MY OWN DISTRICT DISABILITY STATUS SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY. WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM I HOPE WE CAN REDUCE THE HEALTH DISPARITY. WITHIN COMMUNITIES AND RAISE THE QUALITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE IN ORDER TO BUILD HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS KIM CHAN WITH CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK AS WELL AS IT NOT JUST BAO. AN INDEPENDENT HEALTH POLICY CONSULTANT. MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST KIMBERLY CHANNEL THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK PLEASED TO BE HERE IS CO SPONSORED ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TWO SEVEN. CALIFORNIA HAS RIGHTLY INVEST IN EXPANDING IN MEDI CAL NOW COVERS ONE IN THREE A PEOPLE OUR STATE INCLUDING HALF OF ALL CHILDREN OF THOSE MEMBERS NEARLY EIGHTY PERCENT ARE ENROLLED IN A MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES MEASURES AND MONITORS THE QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED MEANT BY MANAGED CARE PLANS AND WHILE UNDER EXISTING PRACTICES MANAGED CARE PLAN. DON'T PERFORM WELL CAN FACE CERTAIN. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND FOR. ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WE KNOW THAT BARRIERS TO BETTER HEALTH STILL EXISTS WE KNOW THAT HEALTH DISPARITIES PROCESS. AND HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF YOUR ZIP CODE YOUR RACE YOUR GENDER OR WHAT LANGUAGE YOU SPEAK. FOR INSTANCE AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WITH RECENT BIRTHS HAVE HIGHER RISK FOR COMPLICATIONS ENDANGERING THE HEALTH AFTER BIRTH. AND YET RECEIVE THE LOWEST. POSTPARTUM THIS RATES AND IN MEDI CAL THESE VISIT THESE NUMBERS ARE GETTING WORSE NOT BETTER THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROUD TO BE WORKING WITH SOME REMEMBER ARAMBULA AND WESTERN CENTER ALONG PARTY TO SPONSOR SOME THE BILL TWO TWO SEVEN. IT WOULD RAISE THE EXPECTATIONS FOR MEDI CAL PLANS THAT PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES ESTABLISHING A NEW MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL CREATE AN INCENTIVE TO EXCEED EXPECTATIONS THROUGH A FINANCIAL CENTER PROGRAM. ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE DATA TO MAKE EVIDENCE BASED DECISIONS INVITES ALL STAKEHOLDERS THE TABLE AND SETTING THE SINCE EXPECTATIONS AND UP FINALLY CLEARLY DEFINES DISPARITIES REDUCTIONS AS A PROGRAM ACTIVE. COVER CALIFORNIA THE STATE'S INSURANCE MARKETPLACES RT MOVED IN THIS DIRECTION REQUIRING HEALTH PLANS THERE TO SHOW PROGRESS TOWARD REDUCING CHRONIC DISEASES. EVERYONE DESERVES QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD HEALTHIER LIVES THIS BILL BRINGS MEDICAID INTO THAT EXPECTATION FOR THESE REASONS THE PEN IS PROUD TO SUPPORT. AB TWENTY TWO SEVEN FIVE REQUESTS DRIVE. THROUGH THE BILL. Q.. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS IGNATIUS BALLAM IN INDEPENDENT HEALTH POLICY CONSULTANT AND I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO WORK WITH NATIONAL GROUPS. LIKE THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE AND THE NATIONAL QUALITY FORUM ON ISSUES OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND HEALTH CARE EQUITY ALSO SERVED. FOR FIVE YEARS AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES TASK FORCE ON MULTICULTURAL HEALTH. AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS THE UNITED STATES IS MOVING AWAY FROM A FEE FOR SERVICE. PROGRAM IN IN WAYS THAT WE PAY FOR HEALTHCARE IN THIS COUNTRY TO MORE VALUE PAYMENTS AT PUT EMPHASIS ON QUALITY AND COST. UNFORTUNATELY MEDICAID FALLS BEHIND IN THIS MOVEMENT TOWARDS VALUE IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AROUND THE COUNTRY AT LEAST A DOZEN. OTHER MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND OTHER STATES ARE MOVING TOWARDS VALLEY BASED PAYMENTS AND AN ADDITIONAL TEN STATES ARE CONSIDERING OR PLANNING THAT KIND OF MOVEMENT. I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO WORK WITH MEDICAID PROGRAMS IN STATES LIKE OREGON IN CONNECTICUT. IMPLEMENTING BOTH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND COST REDUCTION AS WELL AS ADDRESSING HEALTH EQUITY. THIS BILL AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FIVE WOULD MOVE CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAID PROGRAM. INTO THIS NATIONAL TREND. EMPHSIZING QUALITY DISPARITIES REDUCTION AND VALIDATES PAINS RIGHT NOW MEDI CAL PLANTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ONLY HELD. TO MEETING THE BOTTOM. THE BOTTOM ONE QUARTER PER PERCENTAGE OF WHERE THE NATIONAL MEDICAID PLANS ARE. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS SET THAT AS A FLOOR AND ASK THOSE MEDICAL PLANS TO INCREASE THEIR PERFORMANCE TOWARDS AT LEAST THE MEDIA? WHICH IS FIFTY PERCENT AND EVEN HIGHER SO THAT IN STATES LIKE OREGON WHICH CURRENTLY SET PERFORMANCE LEVELS OF SEVENTY FIVE TO NINETY PERCENT OF THAT NATIONAL AVERAGE WOULD BE THE PLACE THAT WE WANT CALIFORNIA ULTIMATELY TO GO. THIS IS RIGHT FOR AND REASONABLE FOR OUR OUR PLANTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES THAT THOSE PLANTS SERVE. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ADDRESS HEALTH EQUITY IN A WAY THAT WE. POSITION CALIFORNIA AS A LEADER IN TAKING CARE OF THE DIVERSE MEDIC HELPING FISHERIES THAT ARE SERVE PARAMEDIC HELP PLANTS. BY COLLECTING DATA ABOUT THEIR DIVERSE HEALTH CARE NEEDS IN MAKING SURE THAT THESE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD TO ALL POPULATIONS. INCLUDING THOSE POPULATIONS THAT OFTEN EXPERIENCE LOCUSTS THOSE DISPARITIES THE MOUSE. AND FINALLY AS NOTED IT LEAVES A LOT OF THE DETAILS OF WHICH SPECIFIC MEASURES AND WHAT THOSE PERFORMANCE LEVELS AND TARGETS MIGHT BE TOO INCLUSIVE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WHICH IS EMINENTLY REASONABLE. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

AND IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND JENNIFER RALLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS. WE REPRESENT A FORTY EIGHT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS ECLECTIC COLLECTIVELY PROVIDE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWO TWO SEVEN FIVE. WE FEEL THAT THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME AND COSTLY BILL IS DUPLICATIVE OF EXISTING MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE QUALITY EFFORTS THAT ARE ENGAGED WITH THE DEPARTMENT. I'M THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS A. A MANAGE CARE QUALITY AND. PROCESS THIS GROUP MEETS AND INCLUDES A STATE CALL A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO. IMPROVE AND MAKE CHANGES TO THE QUALITY PROGRAM. I'M UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT COORDINATES A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW TO UPDATE THE EXISTING QUALITY STRATUS STRATEGY PROCESS. THIS PROCESS ALLOWS FOR BUILDING ON TO PRY YOUR STRATEGY. FOR YOU EVALUATING MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PERFORMANCE UPDATING PROGRESS TOWARDS MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES FOR HE AND INDICATORS. ESTABLISHING NEW TARGETS FOR IMPROVEMENT. AND IF FUTURE AND INTRODUCING FUTURE INTERVENTIONS IN DESCRIBING CHANGES IN SERVICE DELIVERY CONTRACTUAL STANDARDS AND ENHANCING OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING. OF THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN D. HTS SUBMITTED OF MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE STRIPPERS STRATEGY REPORTS THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID MENTORS MEDICAID SERVICES IS REQUIRED IN THE FEDERAL MEDICAID RULE. AND THEY RELEASED THEIR DRAFT REPORT. JUSTICE LAST MARCH OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. AGAIN WITH THEIR STATE ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND INDICATED THAT THEY WERE COMMITTED TO HELPING ELIMINATE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE AND ALIGN ITS QUALITY EFFORTS WITH. THE CMS THE CENTERS FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES QUALITY STRATEGY. AND THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ACTION PLAN TO REDUCE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES. AND SO IT'S NOT THAT MY MEMBERS MY MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE MEMBERS DISAGREE OF THAT THEIR NEED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF MEDICARE OUT WE DO. MORE FULLY COMMITTED TO MAKING THOSE CHANGES BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT AT AT THE YOU KNOW NINETY FOUR PLUS YOU TO SCORE MEASURES IN OTHER. I IN THE CAPS SURVEY WHICH IS SET OUT TO A YOU KNOW ENROLLEES TURF TO MEASURE THEIR PROGRESS. IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S AN EXISTING PROGRAM QUARTERLY UPDATES OF OF THAT DATA IS REPORTED ON D. H. CSS WEBSITE. AND SO WE REALLY AREN'T PROCESS AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE SPONSORS ON THIS. IS HOW TO IMPROVE WHAT'S ALREADY THERE. ON THE MEDI THE FINAL MEDICAID THROUGH YOU KNOW RULE WAS RESPONDED TO BY THE DEPARTMENT AND. YOU KNOW PARTNERSHIP WITH MY MEMBERS TO KIND OF ADDRESS WHAT THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ARE. AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE ON. CUTS OF THE DATA HAVE IF YOU WILL THAT ARE REQUIRED IN THE BILL AND AND HOW WILL THAT INFORMATION BE PROVIDED. SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR VOLUNTARY INFORMATION THAT MEDICAID ENROLLEES PRESENT WHEN THEY ENROLL FOR THE PROGRAM. AND I'M NOT ALL THAT INFORMATION IS TRANSLATED TO MY MEMBERS SO WE'LL REQUIRED TO REPORT EQUALITY SCORE BASED ON THAT. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT I MEAN THERE'S JUST SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE SPELL? PLAN AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOW ABOUT THANK YOU. EROTIC YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I I TRIED YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE I I AM CONFUSED SOME BECAUSE WE HAD ARE STAYING WAS. THAT THERE ISN'T A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. GOING ON NOW IS THAT CORRECT. BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD NOW THAT% THERE IS SO ARE STANDING AT THE. AT THE COMMITTEE IF THERE WAS NOT IN A ROBUST TAKEOVER PROCESS MISTER CHAIR THERE IS. A FEEDBACK THAT THE DEPARTMENT ELICITS FOR EIGHTY FIVE DOCUMENT IT PURPORTS OUT ON THE THINGS TO CONSIDER SINCE IN. QUALITY I THINK THE PIECE THAT WE'RE. HOPING TO CHANGE THAT THERE'S NOT A CONCLUSION TO WHAT THOSE EXPECT WHEN IN SETTING WHAT THOSE. GOALS ARE RIGHT SO THEY CAN HAVE A DOCUMENTS A HEAR HEAR THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO THERE'S NOT CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU KNOW SETTING WHAT THOSE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVELS ARE WHICH ARE REALLY THE. THINGS THAT HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR PERFORMANCE ARE NOT A A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE SELECTION OF PARTICULAR MEASURES WE KNOW THAT COULD CONSULT SOME STAKEHOLDERS BUT. OFTENTIMES WE KNOW THAT A CONSUMER STAKEHOLDERS OTHERS ARE NOT IN THE ROOMS AND FOR THIS CONVERSATION. SO THERE IS STAKEHOLDER. BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE WOULD CONSIDER ROBUST YOU CONSIDER ROBUST SO. YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT. YOU KNOW I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THE D. H. CSS STAKEHOLDER PROCESS I YOU KNOW DO LEGISLATION CAP HAS REGULATORY STAFF THAT PARTICIPATES IN THAT. BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IF ANYBODY INCLUDING YOU KNOW CAP OR ANY ORGANIZATION HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A PROBABLY REQUEST A MEETING WITH THEM. THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS REQUIRED IT REAP REQUIRED THEIR REPORT TO THE PUBLISHED IN MARCH STATES THAT THEY HAVE ONE. THAT'S I WOULD THINK THAT IF AN ORGANIZATION AT QUESTIONS ON WHAT THAT PROCESS WAS THAT THEY WOULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT. YOU HAVE A COMMENT. I THINK THAT PERHAPS WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THAT. HAVING ATTENDED SOME OF THOSE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND. TALK TO SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES ABOUT THEM WE THINK THAT THERE COULD BE IMPROVEMENT WE DO THINK THAT FOR INSTANCE IN SELECT SELECTING SOME OF THOSE HE JUST MEASURES. WE HEAR AFTER THE FACT THAT DEPARTMENT HAS HAS DECIDED HERE'S WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE. AND IT'S NOT LIKE THAT WE. INHERENTLY OBJECT TO SOME OF THE THE THE METRICS ARE CHOSEN SOMETIMES THEY ARE THE APPROPRIATE ONES BUT SOMETIMES. FOR INSTANCE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH. OUR FRIENDS IN THE CHILDREN'S. GROUPS. IF THEY KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER CHIP. CHILD SPECIFIC METRICS THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED BUT THEY'RE NOTIFIED AFTER THE FACT YOU'RE THE ONES THAT WE'VE CHOSEN. SO THAT SO THAT'S WHERE THE DISCONNECT IS HAPPENING IS OFTENTIMES IT'S REPORTED OUT HIS WILL BE CHOSEN YES YOU'RE ENGAGING US BUT YOU'RE NOT REALLY OFFERING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON WHETHER. THESE MIGHT BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE THINGS TO BE LOOKING AT. KIND OF. IT AND JUST TO ADD TO THAT I SPECIFICALLY THINKING ABOUT THE EXTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY SET THAT WAS SIZE. SUBMITTED FOR COMMENT AND AND THEN I HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS WORK WORKS AT DIFFERENT OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WORK DISCUSSES PART OF THAT THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND SAID THAT DEPARTMENT. ON SPECIFIC TO MISS JONES POINT ABOUT CERTAIN RECOMMENDATIONS PARTICULARLY AROUND THE CHILDREN'S AYE ADDING CERTAIN METRICS WERE NOT INCLUDED AND THERE WAS NO BUDGET. NOT A ROBUST DISCUSSION AROUND THAT AND SO THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT BUT A WHETHER THOSE COMMENTS ARE INCORPORATED IS A DIFFERENT STORY. GOOD. IF YOU'RE A MUCH ME ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OF DR EMIL WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE STATUS QUO IS NOT ENOUGH TO DRIVE COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS AND DISPARITIES REDUCTIONS. AND MEANWHILE THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS RELYING ON MEDICAL SUFFERS AND WHY DISPARITIES IN RACE AND ETHNICITY PROCESSED. AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY FIVE CLEARLY DEFINES DISPARITIES REDUCTIONS AS A PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND ENSURES THAT WE HAVE THE DATA TO MAKE EVIDENCE BASED DECISIONS AND TO ADDRESS THESE DISPARITIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HAD WE DO HAVE AMENDMENTS. ARE YOU ACCEPTING OUR AMENDMENTS YES MISTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WE HAVE A MOTION. WE NEED A SECOND.

NO WE DID NOT TRY AB TWENTY NINE SIX NINE FIVE WE DID NOT DO YET. THANK YOU. PLEASE GO AHEAD. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS BELIEF THAT I BECAME A DOCTOR. SO THAT I COULD CARE FOR THE RESIDENTS ALL OF THE RESIDENTS OF MY COMMUNITY IN THE CENTRAL SAN JOAQUIN. VALLEY. AS A DOCTOR I SAW THE CHALLENGES FACING MANY CALIFORNIANS TRYING TO GET GOOD MEDICAL CARE. I ALSO SAW MANY OF THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. PARTICULARLY THOSE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET THE MEDICAL CARE THAT THEY NEED. THE FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE PUT IT SUCCINCTLY. UNINSURED PEOPLE ARE LESS ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE TOO LITTLE MEDICAL CARE AND TO RECEIVE IT TOO LATE. AS A RESULT. THEY ARE SECKER AND DIE SOONER. I HAVE SEEN THIS FIRST HAND. I WAS ON THE FRONT LINES OF HEALTH CARE AND FEEL THE URGENCY TO FIX OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE CRISIS. AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY FIVE SEEKS TO EXPAND MEDICAL COVERAGE TO INCOME ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. SIMPLY PUT THIS BILL REMOVES A BARRIER TO HELP ACCESS DUE TO IMMIGRATION STATUS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS UNJUSTLY IMPOSED. ABTWENTY NINE SIXTY FIVE WILL BRING CALIFORNIA CLOSER TO ENSURING THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS COMPREHENSIVE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE. IN ARE RECENTLY CONCLUDED SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. CHAIRMAN WOOD AND I CO CHAIRED HEALTH CARE EXPERTS REITERATED SEVERAL TIMES. THAT THE SHORT TERM STEP TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS TO WOR WITHIN CALIFORNIANS CURRENT FRAGMENTED FINANCING SYSTEM AND IMPROVED COVERAGE TO EXPAND MEDICAL COVERAGE TO THE UNINSURED. NEARLY SIXTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS REMAINING UNINSURED POPULATION WHICH IS NEARLY THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS IS UNDOCUMENTED. ACCORDING TO THE UC REPORT RELEASED AT THE END OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS. SPENDING ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL TO THIS POPULATION WOULD LIKELY MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INROADS TOWARDS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. OVER THE LAST YEAR WE HAD WITNESSED THE BARRAGE OF ATTACKS ON HEALTH CARE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. INCLUDING MULTIPLE EFFORTS TO REPEAL THE ACA AND VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS THAT UNDERMINE ACCESS TO CARE. CALIFORNIA HAS WORKED TO SHIELD OUR STATE FROM THESE ATTACKS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO CHAMPION AND LEAD THE NATION IN BOLD AND INCLUSIVE POLICIES THAT SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. DUE TO ARE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS BEING UNABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH INSURANCE. AND THE COMBATANT COMPOUNDING FEARS AND CHILLING EFFECT CREATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND ADDITIONAL TRAUMAS ARE CREATING AN URGENCY TO ENSURE THEY ARE PROTECTED AND ENSURE. INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE CARE IN A TIMELY MANNER TO PREVENT ILLNESSES FROM DETERIORATING. MANY UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ONLY ACCESS HEALTH CARE IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. WHERE MANY TIMES POSITIONS LIKE MYSELF ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO HELP DUE TO THE EXACERBATION OF THEIR ILLNESS? I HAVE SEEN COUNTLESS CASES IN MY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN OUR COUNTRY'S BREAD BASKET. WHERE THE FARM WORKERS WHO HELPED TO PRODUCE THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT FILL OUR TABLES AND FEED OUR FAMILIES ARE UNABLE TO DO THE SAME? FOR THEIR OWN FAMILIES DUE TO THEIR DIRE HEALTH CIRCUMSTANCES. NOT ONLY IS THIS CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS DETRIMENTAL TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. BUT ALSO INCREASES THE DEMAND ON EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES AND INCREASES COST IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OVERALL IN A MANNER THAT COULD BE PREVENTED. WE CAN DO BETTER. THIS LEGISLATION BUILDS UPON THE WORK OUR LEGISLATURE HAS DONE WITH HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS WHICH HAS CHECK WAS BEEN CHAMPIONED BY SENATOR LOTT. WHO I AM PROUD TO BE WORKING WITH THIS YEAR TO EXPAND TO ALL LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS? FELLOW MEMBERS.

IS IT WOULD BE FOR THE GENERAL FUND SOME ASSUME IT'S TO BE GENERAL FUND COST. FOR THAT DID TO BE ABLE TO TO RUN THIS PROGRAM. WELL MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT STILL WAS A POLICY COMMITTEE AND NOT THERE FISCAL SIDE OF THINGS AND. BUT I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SO. LAST YEAR WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT HEALTH FOR ALL YOUNG ADULTS THE PRICE TAG FOR THAT SECTION WAS ANYWHERE BETWEEN. FIFTY FIVE AND NINETY MILLION AND THAT WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE AGE FROM EIGHTEEN UP TO TWENTY SIX. AND I CAN SAY WITHOUT GETTING INTO SPECIFICS THAT IT'S LESS THAN THE SIZE OF OUR SURPLUS. AND SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH AS WE GO THROUGH BOTH APPROPRIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE MUST ADDRESS GOING FORWARD. OTHER QUESTIONS BECOMES A MISS KOREA. I THINK HEAR TO THE AUTHOR OUT IN THE VERY POWERFUL TESTIMONY I JUST WANNA SAY THAT REGARDLESS OF LEGAL STATUS OR LANGUAGE.

THANK YOU AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR IF YOU PERMIT. THE GIFT. MR THURMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I GUESS I WOULD ALSO ASK THE QUESTION. WHAT'S THE COST TO NOT TAKE THIS ACTION AND WE HAVE KNOWN FOR DECADES THAT. WHEN ANY INDIVIDUAL IN THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THAT THAT DRIVES UP OUR COST OF EMERGENCY ROOM CARE IN OTHER. WAYS AND THAT. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT AND SO YOU KNOW AS SOMEONE WHO WAS A CO AUTHOR OF HEALTH CARE FOR ALL KIDS AND WHO SUPPORTED THIS LEGISLATION. WITH SENATOR LARRY JUST LIKES ME HOW ODD IT WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD SAY THAT FOR FAMILY OF ONE PARTY YOUR FAMILY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. A BUT THAT'S NOT EXTENDED TO YOUR PARENTS OR TO YOUR FAMILY OR TO SOMEONE ELSE AND SO THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE BOLD. ARE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD I WOULD BE HONORED IF YOU'D HAVE ME AS A CO AUTHOR AND.

GET HELP FOR PAYING FOR THEIR COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES SO THAT THE CO PAY FOR A DOCTOR'S VISIT IS FIVE DOLLARS OR TEN DOLLARS. AND THE CO PAY FOR GENERIC DRUG IS THREE DOLLARS OR FIVE DOLLARS. BUT CONSUMERS WHO MAKE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PERCENT OF POVERTY GET LITTLE OR NO HELP PAYING FOR COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES. LOTS OF THEM BY BRONZE PLANS WHAT THE DEDUCTIBLE OF OVER SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND WHAT DO THEY GET FOR THIS BRONZE COVERAGE. THREE DOCTOR VISITS AT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS OR EIGHTY DOLLARS A VISIT AND THEN THEY PAY CASH FOR EVERY PRESCRIPTION. EVERY LAB TEST EVERY XRAY IN EVERY DOCTOR VISIT AFTER THE FIRST THREE UNTIL THEY SPEND SIXTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET. MEMBERS WE ALL KNOW THAT ALMOST NO ONE LIVING ON TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OR THIRTY THOUSAND OR EVEN FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR. HAS SIX THOUSAND IN THE BANK TO COVER THEIR MEDICAL COSTS. WHAT THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE SHOWS IS THAT PEOPLE WHO FACE SUCH HUGE DEDUCTIBLES SKIP DOCTOR VISITS? UP THEIR PILLS IN HALF DON'T GET THE LAB TEST THAT THEIR DOCTOR ORDERED. AS AN EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE DON'T GET THE CARE THEY NEED TO MANAGE THEIR DIABETES. OR ASTHMA OR HEART DISEASE. THEY END UP IN MY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITH AN AVOIDABLE HEALTHCARE COST. IN CRISIS THEY HAVE AN ASTHMA ATTACK A COMPLICATION OF THEIR DIABETES OR SOME OTHER HEALTH CRISIS. AND THAT IS WHY MY BILL TODAY IS ABOUT. MY BILL WOULD PROVIDE HELP TO CALIFORNIANS WHO BUY COVERAGE AS INDIVIDUALS AND WHO MAKE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AB THIRTY ONE FORTY EIGHT WOULD SAY THAT THOSE WHO MAKE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND WOULD GET AS MUCH HELP PAYING FOR COPAYS. AND DEDUCTIBLES AS THOSE WHO MAKE LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. SO THEY WOULD HAVE A TEN DOLLAR DOCTOR VISIT AND FIVE DOLLAR CO PAY FOR GENERIC DRUG. AND WE WOULD PROVIDE HELP TO THOSE WHO MAKE THIRTY SIX THOUSAND TO FIFTY THOUSAND SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR DOCTOR VISIT AND A FIFTEEN DOLLAR CO PAY FOR GENERIC DRUGS. MEMBERS NOBODY WHO LIVES ON LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO HAVE COVERAGE WITH THE DEDUCTIBLE OVER SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT IS JUST WRONG AND WE CAN FIX. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS HELPED MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS BUT WE STILL HAVE THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNINSURED AND ONE POINT TWO MILLION OF THEM ARE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. WHO DON'T GET COVERAGE FROM THEIR EMPLOYER AND NEED MORE HELP PAYING THE COVERAGE? THE THREE BILLS YOUR HEARING TODAY MY BILL MISTER CHOOSE AND LATER MRS FRIEDMAN'S TAKEN TOGETHER WITH MY BILL ON EXPANDING MEDICAL TO THE UNDOCUMENTED. WHICH YOU JUST HEARD GIVES CALIFORNIA A PATH FORWARD TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WE CAN GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WITH A. B. THIRTY ONE FORTY EIGHT AND THE THREE OTHER BILLS I MENTIONED AND THE POLITICAL WELL. WE WILL BE CLOSER TO THAT GOAL. I HAVE WITNESSES HERE WITH ME TODAY IT'S BETH CAPELL FROM HELP ACCESS AS WELL AS JIM FLORIO FROM THE WESTERN CENTER OF LAWN PARTY. BEST PILL ON BEHALF OF HEALTH TEXAS CALIFORNIA WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AND SPONSOR THIS MEASURE THAT WOULD HELP TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY IN TERMS OF COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES FOR PEOPLE IN COVERED CALIFORNIA. AS ADVOCATES WE HAVE WORK TO COVERED CALIFORNIA YEAR AFTER YEAR LOOKING UP THE COST SHARING FOR THE STANDARD COVERED CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS. WE I PARTICIPATED IN A VERY COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH HEALTH PLANS AND COVERED CALIFORNIA TO DESIGN. COST SHARING THAT IS STANDARDIZED FOR THE COVERED CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS WE HAVE LEARNED THE HARD WAY THAT WHAT BRUNCH COVERAGE MEANS IS A DEDUCTIBLE OF SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS WHEN YOU HAVE CUT TO HAVE. COVERAGE THAT COVERS ON AVERAGE SIXTY PERCENT THE COST OF CARE FOR AN AVERAGE POPULATION. IN CONTRAST MOST OF YOU WHO GET SURE COVERAGE THROUGH A LARGE EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE COVERAGE THE COST COVERS NINETY PERCENT OF THE COST OF CARE. IT IS REALLY OF HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE BEST CALIFORNIA CAN DO IS TO GIVE CALIFORNIANS WHO MAKE LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. COVERAGE WITH DEDUCTIBLES OF OVER SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AB THIRTY ONE FORTY EIGHT PROVIDES FINANCIAL HELP SO THAT THOSE WHO MAKE TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS CAN GET. CAN HAVE MORE AFFORDABLE COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES. ALMOST MEMBERS THIS IS PART OF GETTING TO UNIVERSAL AS DOCTOR ARAMBULA JUST SAID ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE IN THIS INCOME RANGE REMAIN UNINSURED WE THINK IN PART BECAUSE THE IDEA OF PAYING PREMIUMS FOR COVERAGE. WITH A DEDUCTIBLE OF OVER SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS DOES NOT SEEM LIKE A VERY GOOD CHOICE IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY WILL IT. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED AS WELL AS IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY COVERED CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JAN FLOREY FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT AB THIRTY ONE FORTY EIGHT. AB THIRTY ONE FORTY EIGHT LIKE AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE IN AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY NINE WOULD HELP SMOOTH OUT SOME OF THAT CLIPS IN ASSISTANCE FROM THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IN PARTICULAR A. B. THIRTY ONE FORTY EIGHT WOULD ADDRESS THE CLIFF THAT OCCURS WHEN ASSISTANCE FOR OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES ALL BUT DISAPPEARS FOR THOSE EARNING JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IF WE TAKE A FAMILY OF FOUR AT JUST ABOVE TO IN A PERCENT EFFECTS OF THE POVERTY LEVEL HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THAT TRANSLATES TO JUST OVER FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR FOR THAT FAMILY OF FOUR JUST OVER FORTY ONE HUNDRED A MONTH. THEY'RE TO KIDS ON MEDI CAL THANKS TO THE CHIP REAUTHORIZATION SO IT'S THIRTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH FOR EACH OF THEIR PREMIUMS. BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABLE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE THE PARENTS COULD BUY A BRONZE PLAN FOR LESS THAN A HUNDRED A MONTH BUT THAT WOULD LEAVE THEM WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED DEDUCTIBLE AT SIXTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IF THEY INSTEAD CHOOSE A SILVER PLAN THEY'RE PAYING ANYWHERE FROM TWO HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED A MONTH BUT THEN THEY STILL FACE A CONSIDERABLE DEDUCTIBLE AND CO PAY WHAT'S WHEN USING CARE. THE DIFFERENCE IN OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES FOR A FAMILY EARNING JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE POVERTY LEVEL AS COMPARED TO A FAMILY EARNING JUST UNDER TWO HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IS TRIPLE. THE DEDUCTIBLE GOES FROM STE AT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED REGULAR DOCTOR VISITS GO FROM TEN DOLLARS TO THIRTY DOLLARS AND GENERIC DRUGS GO FROM FIVE TO FIFTEEN. ONCE A FAMILY STARTS EARNING JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES. AND THE DEDUCTIBLE FOR SOBRE PLAN IS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. IN ORDER TO MAKE COVERAGE AFFORDABLE THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IT NEEDS TO BE AFFORDABLE NOT JUST TO PURCHASE BUT AFFORDABLE TO USE. THE FEDERAL STANDARDS OF AFFORDABILITY MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE IN A STATE WITH A MUCH LOWER COST OF LIVING WHERE A FAMILY EARNING BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE POVERTY LEVEL IS SOLIDLY MIDDLE CLASS. BUT IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE COST OF HOUSING A LOAN SO EXCEEDINGLY EXPENSIVE PEOPLE NEED MORE HELP. WITHOUT THIS HELP THEY WILL EITHER CHOOSE A BRONZE PLAN THAT LEAVES HIM EXPOSED WHEN THEY ACTUALLY NEED CARE GO WITHOUT COVERAGE OR FORGO OTHER BASIC NEEDS. AB THIRTY ONE FORTY EIGHT BUILDS ON THE SYSTEM WE DO HAVE TO PUT COVERAGE WITHIN REACH HELPS FAMILIES WHO PURCHASE COVERAGE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT WHEN THEY NEED IT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. CAN REALLY TELL THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH ORGAN SUPPORT. GIVE.

I THINK YOU AYE MISTER CHAIR DR WEBER AND MEMBERS. I CALIFORNIANS HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS INSURING OUR CHILDREN ARE COVERED WITH ADEQUATE HEALTH INSURANCE BUT UNFORTUNATELY OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STILL REMAIN UNINSURED. OF THOSE STILL ENSURE NEARLY HALF ARE ELIGIBLE BY MEDI CAL BUT HAVE NOT ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. WIKI IS THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN ACCORDING TO RESCIND RESYNC CAO WAKE ENROLLMENT EITHER SIDE. OVER NINETY THOUSAND WEEK CHILDREN ARE NOT WORLD INCOME MEDI CAL DESPITE BEING ELIGIBLE AB TWENTY AND FIVE SEVENTY NINE ESTABLISHES AN EXPRESS LANE ELIGIBILITY PATHWAY. FROM WEEK TO MEDI CAL AND WOULD ALLOW CHILDREN APPLYING TO THE WITH PROGRAM TO SUBMIT A SINGLE APPLICATION TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ATTAIN EXPRESS LANE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE ROUGHLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND PREGNANT WOMEN WHO ARE ON WEEK BUT NOT WORLD IN MEDI CAL DESPITE THEIR ELIGIBILITY. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY NINE ENSURES THAT PREGNANT WOMEN ENROLLED IN WHAT COULD BE PRESUMPTIVELY ENROLLED INTO MEDICARE WHICH WOULD PROVIDE TEMPORARY BUT IMMEDIATE COVERAGE WHILE THE COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS. STREAMLINING APPLICATION ROWAN PROCESS FOR MEDI CAL AND WEEK IT'S JUST CRITICAL STRATEGY FOR INCREASING ENROLLMENT OF UNINSURED AND ELIGIBLE CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN INTO THESE PROGRAMS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AND I HAVE WITNESSES HERE FROM CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP. AND CALIFORNIA WEAK ASSOCIATION. ACUTE DYSENTERY SINCE TO DO SUPPORT SUPPORT MOTION AND SECOND SO.

A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN FOR HEALTH COVERAGE AND MORE CHILDREN ARE INSURED AND FOR WAKING CALIFORNIA NATIONALLY THERE'S ALSO CHANGES ONE OF WHICH IS A DECLINE IN PARTICIPATION. AS A CONSEQUENCE THERE'S VARIOUS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PARTICIPATION ONE BEING LINKING ELECTRONICALLY IN THE REFERRAL AND APPLICATION PROCESS TO OTHER FEDERAL PROGRAMS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE WICK PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTING A NEW MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THAT WORK IS JUST BEGINNING THE FIRST GOAL WILL BE TO TRANSITION FROM PAPER CHECKS THE EBT CARDS. FOR SHOPPING FOR WEEK FOODS THAT MY A SYSTEM WILL OF COURSE BE EXPECTED TO EVENTUALLY PROVIDE OTHER FUNCTIONS TO SUPPORT THE WICK PROGRAM. WHILE THE WICK AND MY SYSTEM IS BEING ESTABLISHED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS IS AN IDEAL TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO ESTABLISH THE LINKAGES. I WITH MEDI CAL AND BEGIN THE PROCESS TO CREATE THE LINKAGES. THIS PROPOSAL TO INCREASE MEDICAL ENROLLMENT BY LINKING WITH MORE CLOSELY. SCORE SUPPORTING BECAUSE IT WOULD PROVIDE INFORMED INFORMATION AND TAKE IMPORTANT STEPS FOR EVENTUALLY CREATING BI DIRECTIONAL LINKAGES THAT COULD ALSO SUPPORT WITH PARTICIPATION.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WILL LET YOU WILL GET YOU KNOW EACH OTHER BILL LATER A DOCTOR WEBER PLEASE COME UP AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WEBER. YEAH I THINK. SELECT FIRST. A THAT THAT'S MY CUE OKAY. AND TODAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF VISITING AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY ONE WHICH IMPROVE THE MEDICARE OUT REVIEW TERMINATION PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THERE ARE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN CALIFORNIA WHO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM REGIONAL CENTERS. THEY SUFFER FROM DISEASES RANGING FROM DOWN SYNDROME TO CEREBRAL PALSY TO A VARIETY OF GENETIC DISEASES. THERE OFTEN DEPENDED ON THEIR FAMILIES FOR SUPPORT BECAUSE THEY HAVE LITTLE OR NO INCOME OR ASSETS. MANY OF THEM DEPEND ON MEDICARE OFF A RELIABLE PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE. WITHOUT STABLE HEALTH INSURANCE THESE INDIVIDUALS CAN EASILY WIND UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR EVEN HOSPITALIZED. EVERYONE MET ON MEDICARE ALL HAS TO GO THROUGH AN ANNUAL ELIGIBILITY REVIEW TERMINATION PROCESS. DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED FOLKS ARE RARELY FOUND TO BE AN ELIGIBLE. IF THEY TURN IN THEIR FORMS LATE OR IF THE COUNTY GETS BACKED UP SOMETIMES DEFICIENCIES CAN WHO VISCOUS MEAN BENEFICIARIES CAN LOSE CUT COVERAGE OF FOR A PERIOD OF TIME DOING THIS RE DETERMINATION PERIOD. THAT MEANS NO MEDICAL REVEALS. UNKNOWN PRIMARY CARE SURGERIES HAVE TO BE RESCHEDULED AND FOR MANY AND FOR ANY PROBLEM THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS NOWHERE TO GO BUT THE EMERGENCY ROOM. THIS PROCESS IS BURDENSOME FOR FAMILIES AND ULTIMATELY CREATES MORE WORK FOR THE COUNTY. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW COUNTIES TO USE INFORMATION FOR THE PAST THIRTY SIX MONTHS IN ORDER TO MAKE ANNUAL ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION FOR BETTER CALVET OF FOR MEDI CAL FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISAIT DISABILITIES. THAT WAY THE COUNTY WILL ONLY NEED TO CONTACT INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES EVERY THREE YEARS TO UPDATE THEIR INCOME INFORMATION INSTEAD OF EVERY YEAR. THE END RESULT WILL BE A DECREASE BIRD ON PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND DISABILITY IN SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCY AT. AT A GROUP ADVOCACY GROUPS AND THERE IS NO OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. Y. WITH WITH ME TODAY IS RYAN SECORD THE CONSTITUENT IN MY DISTRICT WHO BROUGHT THIS IDEA FORWARD WORKS CLOSELY WITH DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED ADULTS. POR. THANK YOU FOR CONCERNS REPORT WITH PEOPLE DISABILITIES. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRYCE YOU CORD I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY ONE. I WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS FOR THE LAST TWENTY ONE YEARS I'VE WORKED IN SOUTHERN SAN DIEGO WITH INDIVIDUALS WERE PROFOUNDLY DISABLED. MEDICALLY FRAGILE. I DO YOU KNOW I'D BEEN A STRAIGHT TO THREE I SEE FDD ENDS IN A MINUTE CARE FACILITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISABLED. THEIR STATE LICENSED. WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE. SUBJECT OF HEALTH CARE CAN BE VERY COMPLICATED THIS IS MADE MORE COMPLEX WE FACTOR IN THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE GROUP OF% INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. I I WAS KIND OF HOPING THE YOUNG LADY WITH THE UP TEMPO WOULD STILL BE HERE. THIS IS WHO I WORK WITH. AT MOTHER DESCRIBED HER TWIN WE HAVE VERY SIMILAR PEOPLE WITHOUT MEDICAL MEDICALLY FRAGILE AND HEADS SPECIAL NEEDS. CURRENTLY WHEN YOU RECEIVE A WRIST SUBMIT AN ANNUAL RECERTIFICATION MEDICAL YOU MUST REMAIN UNDER THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR ASSET LIMIT. MOON THAT'S WHAT CURRENTLY REQUIRED BY LAW. THE ASSET LIMIT FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WILL SOON BE CHANGING THANKS TO THE BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE ACT SPECIFICALLY IN CALIFORNIA THE SOON TO BE I HOPE. TO FINALIZE CAL ABLE PROGRAM THIS ESSENTIALLY ALLOW PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO SAVE UP TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS RATHER THAN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THEIR ELIGIBILITY. AND ADDITIONAL FACTOR MADE A DECISION MAKING WAS THE NUMBER OF TIMES DURING READ DETERMINATION PROCESS THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS TEMPORARILY LOSE THEIR COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. DAVID TIME BUT NOT WITHOUT COVERAGE FROM MONTH OR MORE AS LONG AS SIX MONTHS WE CURRENTLY HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN IN RE DETERMINATION FOR OVER FOUR MONTHS INTO THIS YEAR. DR. SO WHAT SAID TAKING PEOPLE TO THE PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE IF THEY DON'T HAVE COVERAGE WOULD BE LEFT WITH I'VE HEARD SPOKEN ABOUT MANY TIMES TODAY WOULD THEY GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. THAT CAN BE VERY COSTLY AND IT'S NOT EFFICIENT. THERE IS THAT EVENTUALLY THEY ALL. GET READ THROUGH READ A TERMINATION AND. THEY HAVE TO RETROACTIVELY PAY THESE. ACUTE CARE FACILITIES FOR THE CARE THAT THEY COULD HAVE AVOIDED AT THE JUST XENA A PRIMARY POSITION. DOCTOR WEBER STATED ABOUT THREADED TWENTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE THE SERVICES THE REGIONAL CENTER. THIS WOULD NOT HAVE THIS WOULDN'T CHANGE NOT ONLY CHANGE FOR THE BENEFITS FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WERE EXPLICITLY COVERED BUT ANYONE ELSE WHO COUNTS ON MEDICARE I'LL BE MAKING THE SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT. THE GENERAL TAXPAYERS WOULD SAVE MONEY BECAUSE INSTEAD OF GOING TO EMERGENCY CARE CRITICAL CARE THEY CAN GET ROUTINE. PREVENTIVE MEDICAL CARE. UNDER TITLE FORTY TO STATE WHAT STATE LICENSED FACILITIES. SUCH AS THE ONE THAT I ADMINISTRATE. ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IN A CHAIN PREVENTIVE IN GENERAL CARE. DURING A RECENT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES LICENSING RES FOR CERTIFICATION THIS IS THE ONLY DEFICIENCY A SITUATION WE HAD NO CONTROL OVER. TO SUM IT UP DUE TO TIME LIMITATIONS AYE MONNING IT ONLY ABLE TO GIVE YOU A CURSORY BICU EST Y. BELIEVE THE PASSAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION IS CREDIBLE. THE FEDERAL. LEVEL FOR ACHIEVING A BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE ACT NOW WE HAD BIPARTISAN SPONSORSHIP BUT IT PASSED OVERWHELMINGLY. BASED. BASED ON THE RESOURCE LIMITS CHANGED MADE FOR THIS PARTICULAR GROUP IN THE POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS TO US ALL BY FORTY MORE ACUTE CARE. AND INTERVENTIONS INCREASING OVERALL EFFICIENCY THE SYSTEM I URGE YOU NOT ONLY TO MOVE FORWARD UNANIMOUSLY BUT ADVOCATE FOR FINAL PASSAGE WITH. YOUR FELLOW MEMBERS. WE DON'T ALWAYS FIND COMMON GROUND THAT WE DO WE SHOULD ACT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GEN FLORA BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT.

TWO ZERO YOUR BILLS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU BUT I DON'T REMEMBER THANK YOU FOR THINK LIMITLESS FOR. THANK YOU THANKS TO WITNESSES AS WELL. THIS FRIEDMAN. S. PREVIEW HAVE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY NINE. AND ITEM NUMBER THIRTY THREE AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY TWO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. OVER THE PAST YEAR ALONE THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE AN AMAZING DEAL OF WORK TO EXAMINE IT BECAUSE IT ADDRESS GAPS IN HEALTHCARE COVERAGE FOR CALIFORNIANS. AS YOU KNOW ALL TOO WELL ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES SEEKING TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IS AFFORDABILITY. TO COVER CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TAX CREDITS IN PLACE TO HELP COVER THE COST OF PREMIUMS FOR THOSE MAKING LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL LIMIT. FOR FPL HOWEVER FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO INCOMES SEAT FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FPL THERE ON THEIR OWN. KEEP IN MIND FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FPL IS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY NINE CREATES A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR THOSE OVER THE FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT FPL TO HELP PAY THE PREMIUM FOR BRONZE LEVEL PLAN. AT THE BRONZE LEVEL PLAN LEVEL IF THEY WANNA IT MORE EXPENSIVE PLAN THEY PAY THE GAP IN COVERAGE. THE CREDIT IS EQUAL TO THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR THE LOWEST COST BROADS PLAN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT IT AT THAT EXCEEDS EIGHT PERCENT OF THEIR MODIFIED ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME. ESSENTIALLY THE BILL ENSURES THAT NO CALIFORNIANS SPENDS MORE THAN A PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME. FOR BASIC HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. TOO ANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE FACING THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE A PAPER HOUSING TRANSPORTATION GROCERIES UTILITIES OR BUYING HEALTH INSURANCE. THE RESEARCH IS CLEAR IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY WILL INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND MOVE US CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY NINE HAS A BROAD COALITION OF SUPPORT THERE WAS NO OPPOSITION AND REQUEST RELIEF REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. BETH CAPELL ON BEHALF HEALTH TAXES CALIFORNIA WE'RE PLEASED TO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. WHICH BUILDS ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BY CAPPING PREMIUMS AT EIGHT PERCENT OF INCOME FOR THOSE OVER FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF POVERTY. TODAY IN EVERY REGION IN CALIFORNIA SOMEONE IN THEIR FORTIES ORFIFTIES WHO BUYS THEIR OWN COVERAGE MAKES JUST OVER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL SPEND MORE THAN EIGHT PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON PREMIUMS. A MARRIED COUPLE IN THEIR TWENTIES. WHAT WHO MAKES OVER SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD SPEND OVER EIGHT PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON PREMIUMS FOR THAT REASON WE'RE PLEASED TO SPORT SUPPORT THIS BILL INTO SPONSOR AND APPRECIATE THE? UP BY PERSON MOTION THANK YOU. Q. AND THE WITNESSES. MARK COVER WITH A SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY AT THE FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY WE ARE A NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL EMPLOYERS ARE CENTRAL TO HEALTHY THRIVING LOCAL COMMUNITIES. OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS THE ACA HAS PROVIDED HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS MANY OF WHOM WORK FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS OR ARE THEMSELVES SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OR SELF EMPLOYED. PART A CA SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES COMPRISE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE WORKING ON AND SHARE IN THE AC HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. FOR CALIFORNIA SELF EMPLOYED ENTREPRENEURS ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND SELF EMPLOYED ENTREPRENEURS GET THEIR INSURANCE THROUGH THE COVER CALIFORNIA INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE. AND ACCORDING TO THE U. S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION THE MEDIAN INCOME. IN CALIFORNIA FOR SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUAL WITH AN INCORPORATED BUSINESS WAS FIFTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS HERE WHICH WOULD LIKELY PUT THEM JUST ABOVE THAT CUT OFF A TO RECEIVE INSURANCE I INSURANCE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE. SO AFFORDABILITY CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS AND FOR ENTREPRENEURS AND AB TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY FOUR FIFTY NINE WOULD ALSO PROMOTE MORE ROBUST SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMY BY REDUCING JOB LOCK. ALLOWING WORKERS WHO PREVIOUSLY FELT TIED TO THEIR JOB BY A LARGE EMPLOYER BENEFITS PACKAGE TO STRIKE OUT ON THEIR OWN OPERA NO PATH OR JOIN A THRIVING SMALL BUSINESS. WELL JOB LUCK HAS BEEN REDUCED UNDER THE ACA THERE REMAINS A CRITICAL ISSUE IT IS INSURANCE IS STILL ON AFFORDABLE. WITH MORE INCREASING AFFORDABILITY WILL MAKE SMALL BUSINESSES MORE COMPETITIVE WHEN THEY'RE SEEKING TO HIRE TALENT. ROUGHLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES WORK FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE CREATED ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OF ALL THE NEW JOBS SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. AND THE SMALLEST BUSINESSES THE ONE THAT HAVE BETWEEN ONE AND FOUR EMPLOYEES HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE FROM OUR CREATING MOST OF THOSE NEW JOBS. SO IS THE SMALL FIRMS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE UNABLE TO AFFORD OR OFFER EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE SO BY EXPLAINING AFFORDABILITY IN OF MARKETPLACE COVERAGE. WE CAN SHARE MORE WORKERS OF THE SMALLEST FIRMS CAN GAIN ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE COVERAGE IN ADDITION TO ENSURING THAT THOSE. THE EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES CAN ALSO AFFORD. AFFORD A INSURANCE TO CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN ONE'S EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME STATUS A DOESN'T THE GOVERNOR ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE CARE TO CONTINUE THE PROGRESS UNDER THE ACA WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT TWENTY FOUR FIFTY NINE TO MAKE HEALTH CARE EVEN MORE AFFORDABLE. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. PARDEE A MOTION AND A SECOND BUT. ANY OTHER ADDITIONS ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHEN THE GREATEST AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. CHRIS KILEY ON OPEN THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT. IN A MENACING CONSUMERS UNION IN SUPPORT. BUT SHALL BACO AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION APOLOGIES AGAIN FOR MISSING THE LETTER DEADLINE WE ARE IN SUPPORT. ANGELIQUE ARE WITH NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND SUPPORT. A FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT ANY. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SAYING NOW COME BACK TO MEMBER QUESTIONS YES SOME OF THE RIVER WATER THINK MRS CHAIR. JUST QUICKLY. WILL WE BE SUBSIDIZING SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO PURCHASE A PLATINUM LEVEL. PLAN WITH THE CREDIT THE WAY IT WOULD WORK IS THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN EIGHT PERCENT OF WHAT THE BRONZE LEVEL WOULD BE IF THEY WANT TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL INSURANCE AND PAY MORE TO GET THE PLATINUM LEVEL FOR THEIR FAMILY. WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO THAT. SO FOR SOME PEOPLE IT THERE. WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE MORE COVERAGE THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION FOR THEM THAT WE WOULD MAKE SENSE OKAY. AND THEN I I HAD BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS OF MAJORITY THE SMALL BUSINESSES BEING IMPACTED BUT WHEN YOU SPOKE IT TOTALLY MAKES SENSE BECAUSE. I'M ON THE SMALL BUSINESS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE I MEAN IF I DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER JOB OR YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND AT SOME POINT. I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD HAVE AFFORDED IT. SO THAT ANSWERS THAT QUESTION AND I COMMEND THEY ALSO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE. YOU KNOW HAVING SERVED ON THE UNIVERSAL CARE A SELECT COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT INSURED Y. AND SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY MAKE ENOUGH WITH ME. TO MEET THEIR ABOVE THE LIMITS BUT ONCE AGAIN IT'S STILL MUCH MORE PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO SPEND SO THEY OPT NOT TO BE INSURED. AND THIS. THIS DIRECTLY GOES TO SOME OF THAT ISSUE WHICH HELPS WITH SOME IMPROVING COVERAGE RATES SO. THANK YOU. THE MOTION IS TO PASS REVENUE THAT ROBIN TAXES ANY FOR THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE WE HAVE A MOTION TO RECALL PLEASE. IF YOU WANT TO CLOSE KNOW NNOVA CHINA MOVES ALONG AND. THAT'S A CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WOULD. MAYES I MAYES I AGREE AND YOUR CURRY AYE BIGELOW.

OF THE SORT SHORT VERSION IS THAT THE SEEKS TO BETTER LICENSE THOSE FACILITIES IT OUT ADDRESSES SOME OVER CONCENTRATION ISSUES WHERE THERE ARE LOOPHOLES IN THE LAW THAT ALLOW FOR.

YET OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS UNDER FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL REMAIN. UNDER IN UNINSURED DESPITE EXTENSIVE OUTREACH BY COVER CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MAKES THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS EXPECTED TO SPEND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH ON PREMIUMS. WE KNOW THAT APPROVING AFFORDABILITY WILL INCREASE TAKE UP OF COVERAGE SAID THIS BILL CAPS WHAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY ACROSS THE INCOME SCALE OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT. A FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL SO THAT CONSUMERS WOULD PAY NO MORE THAN EIGHT PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON THEIR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. WITH THAT I WILL TURN TO HEALTH ACCESS AND WESTERN. DR SPOCK THINKING THAT YOU AND IN LIGHT OF THE LATE HOUR AND I SEE LOTS OF WORDS ON YOUR PAGES UNDER PAPER THERE WOULD JUST KEEP IT A LITTLE BIT THE LOOK LITTLE QUICKER IF YOU CAN'T. THE LETTER TO MISTER CHAIR BETH CAPELL ON BEHALF OF HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA PLEASED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT AS A SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE.

GOOD AFTERNOON OR EVENING JAN FOURTH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE IT ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL PREMIUM ASSISTANCE THERE'S TWO MAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT THIS IS HELPING. ONE PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE BELOW ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHICH IS THE MEDI CAL CUT OFF. ON COVERED CALIFORNIA THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER THERE LAWFULLY PRESENT IMMIGRANTS BUT BECAUSE OF A TECHNICALITY THEY CAN'T GET ON MEDI CAL BUT THEY CAN'T PURCHASE COVER CALIFORNIA COVERAGE. AND ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE IS PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER AGE SIXTY FIVE BUT THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR FORTY QUARTERS AND THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T MEET. THEY GO OVER THE ASSETS TEST SO THEY'RE STUCK WITH NOTHING. THE ACID TEST IS JUST TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS SO AND AT THAT AGE AT AGE SIXTY FIVE YOU CAN'T REASONABLY PURCHASE UP COVERAGE ON YOUR OWN SO THOSE PEOPLE ARE ALSO UNCOVERED CALIFORNIA. THE OTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT THIS HELPS PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE CALIFORNIA BUT THEY NEED A BIT OF ASSISTANCE. TO KEEP PURCHASING COVER CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU MOVE FROM MEDICAID OUT TO COVER CALIFORNIA YOU GO FROM FREE CARE. AT YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE'S NO MONTHLY PREMIUM ARE FREE AT THE POINT THAT YOU PURCHASE IT.

I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTY NINE YEARS TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE A A TO UPDATE THEIR REGULATIONS ON THE PROCESSING OF MEDICAL LIMON A VERY EXCITING BILL BUT ACTUALLY A VERY NECESSARY. BILL. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING HEALTH FACILITY OPERATIONS WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF PATIENTS IN AND TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AS PART OF THIS STUDY THE DEPARTMENT MUST DEVELOP REGULATIONS SPECIFYING HOW HOSPITAL LINENS SHOULD BE CLEAN PRIOR TO RE YEARS. THE LAST TIME THE DEPARTMENT UPDATED THESE REGULATIONS WAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE A LONG TIME AGO. IN THE THIRTY THREE YEARS SINCE THROUGH THESE REGULATIONS TOOK EFFECT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND CLEAN METHODS HAVE LED TO MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT OPERATIONS. AND OTHER STATES. CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ON RECOVERIES HAVE NOT REALIZE HE'S EFFICIENCIES DUE TO OUR WOEFULLY OUT OF DATE. REGULATIONS OVER THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD. AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTY NINE SIMPLY DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW THESE REGULATIONS IN LIGHT OF THREE DECADES OF CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY. HAS GONE THROUGH AND UPDATE THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR EXISTING REGULATORY PROCESS WE HAVE NEW TECHNOLOGY WE CAN MAKE THEM EVEN CLEANER TODAY. WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS RJ SETTLEMENT CERVANTES ON BEHALF OF THE TEXTILE RENTAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION AND NOEL. A RICHARDSON CEO OF SHASTA LINEN SUPPLY. RICHARD.

TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT WITH OUR WATER USE WHILE ALSO REDUCING OUR EMISSIONS FOOTPRINT IN THE PROCESS. WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPING COLD WATER DETERGENT FORMULAS. WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND WATER RECLAMATION USED TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE. AS WE STRIVE TO MAKE MORE SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS CHOICES WE NEED A PARTNER IN GOVERNMENT THAT ALLOWS US TO DO SO. THAT'S WHY FINALLY UPDATING TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATIONS ON MEDICAL AND LAUNDRY MAKE SOME.

WHICH IS. A. SIX TWENTY FIVE NINETY ONE. NICE EH AND. MAKE SOME COMMENTS BEFORE YOU GO OFF YOUR FURY QUE OKAY WITH THAT YES I CONSIDER THANK YOU. SO. I I SHARE YOUR CONCERN THAT. MUCH NEEDED EMERGENCY ROOM IS CLOSING IN YOUR DISTRICT AND THAT THIS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE IN THE GREATER LONG BEACH AREA. THE COMMITTEE HAS A LONGSTANDING RECORD ONLY GRANT TEEN SEISMIC EXTENSIONS TO HOSPITALS THAT HAVE SEISMIC COME UP COMPLIANCE PLANS IN PLACE. LONG BEACH COMMUNITY HOSPITAL HAS NO SUCH PLAN. HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF BEEN PLANNING FOR UPCOMING SEISMIC DEADLINES FOR YEARS NOW. IS SORT APPEARS IT UNIT YOU NOT ONLY HAVE A SEISMIC PROBLEM BUT A PLANNING PROBLEM AS WELL. NOT TO MENTION YOU YOU HAD DO NOT HAVE AN OPERATOR FOR THE HOSPITAL WHEN THE CURRENT PROVIDER MOVES ON. WELL I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE OFFER EFFORTS TO SAVE THE HOSPITAL I'M VERY UNCOMFORTABLE GRANTING AN EXTENSION TO A HOSPITAL LOCATED ON AN ACTIVE FAULT LINE. WITHOUT KNOWING HOW OR WHEN THE FACILITY WILL EVER MEET COMPLIANCE. YOUR CITY NEEDS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN. I'M GONNA LET YOU PRESENT YOUR BILL TODAY. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HOLD THE BILL IN COMMITTEE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE CITY OF LONG BEACH HAS A PLAN. DEMONSTRATING HOW THE HOSPITAL CAN ME SEISMIC COMPLIANCE. ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT MISTER O'DONNELL FIVE YES I AM MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU AND THANK YOU OUT TO YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF TO. THE BEST OF THE BEST FOR SURE AND NOW WE ARE A TOUGH SPOT. ABOUT THE CITY IS WORKING HARD ON DEVELOPING THAT PLAN SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. AND IF I COULD JUST DO ONE RIVER OTHERS ALLOW PLACE TO. PLEASE TAKE YOUR. SO GOOD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND AGAIN I UNDERSTAND YOUR COME CONCERNS APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO EDUCATE THE COMMITTEE. ABOUT THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE CLOSURE OF A HOSPITAL IN MY DISTRICT. I DESPERATELY NEEDED HOSPITAL. THE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL LONG BEACH IS A LICENSED A CUTE AND PSYCHIATRIC CARE HOSPITAL LOCATED IN THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. IT IS THE ONLY FULL SERVICE EMERGENCY ROOM LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF LONG BEACH S. SERVE THE SURROUNDING DENSE RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY. FOR OVER NINETY YEARS. THE CITY OF LONG BEACH OWNS THE LAND AT COMMUNITY HOSPITAL WHILE MEMORIAL CARE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PROVIDES DAY TODAY. HOSPITAL SERVICES. LAST NOVEMBER WHEN OIL CARE SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENT TO CEASE OPERATIONS. BY JUNE TWENTY NINETEEN CITING THEIR INABILITY TO MEET TWENTY TWENTY SEISMIC SAFETY STANDARDS REQUIRED UNDER LAW. FOLLOWING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT I INTRODUCED AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY ONE TO EXTEND SEISMIC COMPLIANCE. MY HOPE WAS TO GIVE THE CITY AND STAKEHOLDERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY INVESTIGATE. ALL OTHER OPTIONS INCLUDING SECURING ANOTHER PROVIDER TO PREVENT THE CLOSURE OF THIS CRITICAL HOSPITAL. UNFORTUNATELY. MEMORIAL CARE HAS RADICALLY ACCELERATED THEIR CLOSURE TIMELINE. THIS MAKES IT ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE CITY TO SECURE AND OTHER PROVIDER. MEMORIAL CARE COULD HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE HAD AN OPEN DIALOGUE WITH THE COMMUNITY AND STAKEHOLDERS WHEN THEY FIRST BEGAN TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY. TO OPERATE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE CITY TO PREPARE FOR THEIR DEPARTURE YEARS BEFORE THE TWENTY TWENTY SEISMIC COMPLIANCE DEADLINE. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT OTHER COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE FACING THE SAME SEISMIC DEADLINE HOWEVER THESE HOSPITALS BEGAN EXTENSIVE PLANNING SOMETIME AGO. WITH MEMORIAL CARE DECIDING TO WALK AWAY MY COMMUNITY IS LEFT HANGING IN THE BALANCE. THE CLOSURE OF COMMUNITY HOSPITAL RESULT IN A DIMINISHED CAPACITY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO MY COMMUNITY. IT WILL ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT A GREATER REGION'S TRAUMA CARE SYSTEM AND FURTHER STRAIN THE HEALTH CARE. SAFETY NET. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHAIR IS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH EXTENDING THE DEADLINE FOR SEISMIC COMPLIANCE UNTIL THE CITY OF LONG BEACH COMPLETES A PLAN DEMONSTRATING HOW AND WHEN THEY WILL MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY. STANDARDS IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CITY IS IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING ON THAT NECESSARY PLAN NOW. IN FACT IN AN EXPEDITED FASHION. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CITY AND THE COMMUNITY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PLAN AND I'M COMMITTED TO FINDING ANY AND ALL SOLUTIONS. KEEP THIS VERY UNNECESSARY HOSPITAL OPEN. I LOOK FOR TO BRING THIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE WANTS THE CITY HAS A PLAN AND I KNOW THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT PLAN. WITH ME ARE TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY. ON THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR HOSPITAL IS THE CITY OF LONG BEACH DIANA TANK. AND THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE MORNING CHAIR WHAT AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS TIME TO HEAR THIS ITEM ON COMMUNITY HOSPITAL OF LONG BEACH ON BEHALF OF THE MAYOR AND THE LONG BEACH CITY COUNCIL I'M HERE REQUESTING THE COMMITTEE TO. AYE AT THE FUTURE DATE CONSIDER PROVIDING THE CITY WITH ADDITIONAL TIME TO MEET STATES LIVES MAKE REQUIREMENTS OUT COMMUNITIES WILL ONE WHICH WE DO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THE SIZE A COMPLIANCE PLAN IN PLACE. AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THE PROVIDER THROUGH THE PROCESS. AS AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THE CITY OF LONG BEACH OWNS THE LAND WE'RE NOT. TOOK A TYPICAL HOSPITAL PROVIDER I AND AT THE TIME WE SIGNED THE LEASE AGREEMENT WITH MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN BOTH PARTIES DID KNOW THERE WAS AN EARTHQUAKE FAULT ON IN THE HOSPITAL. BUT FOR THE CITY IT WAS NOT UNTIL TWO MONTHS AGO THAT WE WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THE EXTENT OF THE EARTHQUAKE FAULTS. รณ I BELIEVE MEMORIAL ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO BEGAN THEIR SEISMIC STUDIES BY IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR WAS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH US. AND UPON RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM THE MORAL. AND THEIR DETERMINATION THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MEET STATE SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS AT COMMITTEE HOSPITAL THE CITY OF ONE MEET JUMPED IN. AND STARTED TO DO OUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE AT THE SITE. SO SO DURING THIS THIS TIME PERIOD WE WENT BELIEVES THAT MEMORIAL HADDA AN EXTENSION FROM US BUT THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE THOUGHT WE HAD ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. IT WAS A SHOCK TO US WHEN MEMORIAL ISSUED THEIR HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY LEAST TERMINATION NOTICE IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR EFFECTIVELY TERMINATING SERVICES BY JULY THIRD TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AGAIN FURTHER COMPOUNDED BY THE LENSES DECISION TO DIVER ALS AMBULANCES FROM THE HOSPITAL. THE CITY OF HASN'T SEVERAL LETTERS TO MEMORIAL CARE SINCE IT'S TIME TO TRY AND STABILIZE THE SITUATION MOST IMPORTANTLY WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE HOSPITAL LICENSE AT COMMUNITY HOSPITAL EXPIRES ON APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH IN JUST ELEVEN DAYS. WE'VE NOTICED THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES LET LICENSE WAS NOT. RENEWED AND I WE HAVE TWICE REQUESTED THAT MEMORIAL CONFIRM THAT THEY WILL INDEED RENEW THEIR LICENSE AND IT APPEARS THAT ON APRIL TWELFTH CITY PEACH. CDP TO CENTRALIZE APPLICATION UNIT DID CONFIRM THAT THEY DO HAVE A COPY OF THE LICENSE APPLICATION ON FILE. AND THEY ARE WAITING TO RECEIVE PAYMENT CLEARANCE FROM THE MORAL BEFORE FINALIZING THE ISSUANCE OF THAT LICENSE. I CAN CURRENTLY AGAIN THE CITY IS MOVING AHEAD ON TELEPATHS TO ONE SECURE PLANNED TO MEET STATE SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS AND TO SECURE AN IMPOSSIBLE PROVIDER. WITH RESPECT TO NEED OUT COMMITTEE HOSPITAL I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH. THE NEED FOR Q. AND PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH SERVICES TO CONTINUE WITH IN THE EAST SIDE OF ONE BEACH THE ONE WHICH FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORTS THAT TRANSPORT PLANES ARE ALREADY BEING IMPACTED AND WE DO EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE. PRIOR TO THE DIVERSION OF ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT AMBULANCES ARE AVERAGE TRANSPORT TIME TO COMMITTEE HOSPITAL FROM THE EAST SIDE WAS SEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES. SINCE THE CLOSURE OF A LAST. SINCE THE CLOSURE TO A LOST PATIENCE THE NEW AVERAGE TRANSPORT TIME HAS JUMPED TO ALMOST NINE MINUTES. THE US TRANSPORT PLANES HAVE NOT YET BEEN AFFECTED BUT WE ARE SEEING A CHANGE IN CALLING THE CALLS FOR BEYONCE PATIENTS HAVE NON NOW GONE UP BY OVER SIX MINUTES. WE ARE ADDITIONALLY SEEING THE PULL OF. FIRE UNITS FROM THE EAST SIDE OF THE CITY TO HOSPITALS ARE LOCATED ON THE WEST SIDE DISPLACING UNITS WHERE THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN STATIONED BEFORE. WHILE WHILE UNITS ARE OUT OF SERVICE TO TO RUN CALLS. PATENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE THE HOPE THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OCCUPANCY RATE IN AREA HOSPITALS IS INCREASING. AND WITH THAT I DO REALIZE THAT WE NEED TO CLOSE AND JUST. WOULD LIKE TO CHAIR THE COMMITTEE TO KNOW THAT THE CITY HAS CONSULTED WITH PARKINSON WELLS WE DO HAVE A NEW AND MORE SEISMIC CONSULTANT AND ALL THAT STEVIE AND ASSOCIATES ON BOARD WE ARE WORKING WITH US PET AND JUST HOW DO. A GREAT CALL YESTERDAY AND ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH SOME CONCEPTUAL PLANS THANK YOU. TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION I'M JUST HERE TO INTRODUCE ALLEN LOCKRIDGE WHO'S BEEN AN RN. PRIMARILY A COMMUNITY HOSPITAL FOR AROUND THIRTY FIVE YEARS. HI. SO MY NAME IS ALAN MARC RICH. BUT LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK HERE TODAY I HAVE BEEN. A REGISTERED NURSE AT LONG BEACH COMMUNITY HOSPITAL FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CHANGES AND THE WAY WE. DO MEDICINE. AND THE WAY WITH THAT WE TRAIN. ALL OF OUR PATIENTS I WANT TO SAY THAT. AS FAR AS THE HOSPITAL GOES LONG BEACH MEMORIAL REALLY DID NOT GIVE US. MUCH TIME TO TRY AND GET A PLAN IN PLACE IT WAS PRETTY MUCH THROWN AT THE CITY AND TO THE EMPLOYEES THAT. YOU GOT A HEART STOPPER JULY THIRD FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU GONNA DO BECAUSE WE'RE LEAVING. OKAY. THE ADDITIONAL TIME OBVIOUSLY IS NEEDED BECAUSE WE. SERVE A HUGE SERVICE TO. EAST LONG BEACH WHERE THE HOSPITAL IS LOCATED. AND IT WAS BUILT AND OPENED IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR SO THE SURROUNDING AREA IS AN OLDER COMMUNITY. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF SENIORS THERE. AND THEY DON'T NEED. TO BE. SHUTTLED ACROSS TOWN OR ACROSS COUNTY LINES TO OTHER HOSPITALS WHEN THEY CAN USE THESE LONG BEACH. AND COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND ALSO THE LOW THE LARGEST POPULATION OF THE HAAS OF. LONG BEACH IS IN EAST LONG BEACH SO THEY'RE TAKING AWAY THE ONLY EMERGENCY ROOM AND ACUTE CARE FACILITY IN EAST LONG BEACH. ADDING TO THE PROBLEM IS THE LONGER WAIT TIMES IN THE EMERGENCY ROOMS OF THESE OTHER HOSPITALS IN LONG BEACH. BUT THE TYPICAL WAIT TIMES IN OUR EMERGENCY ROOM IS A TWO TO FOUR HOURS AND THAT'S IN THE DOOR AND OUT THANK YOU. Z. WAIT TIMES AT LONG BEACH MEMORIAL WHERE THEY'RE DIVERTING THE PATIENTS TO. IS ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO TWELVE HOURS. DEPENDING ON HOW SERIOUS YOU ARE. THERE WAS A GENTLE MAN IN JANUARY THAT WHEN THE END FOR HEADACHES WAITED IN THE OUTER WAITING ROOM FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR HOURS. GOT TRIAGE MOVED INTO THE INNER WAITING ROOM AND WHEN THEY WENT TO GO FIND THEM FAMILY SAID HE WAS IN THE BATHROOM HE HAD HUNG HIMSELF. WHILE WAITING TO BE SEEN. THEY FORTUNATE WERE ABLE TO REVIVE HIM. YOU SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT THAT LONG. OBVIOUSLY THIS MAN HAD OTHER PROBLEMS SO WHEN LONG BEACH MEMORIAL SAYS THIS IS A BUSINESS DECISION THIS IS MORE THAN A BUSINESS DECISION THIS IS A LIFE AND DEATH DECISION. THIS INVOLVES THE COMMUNITY THIS INVOLVES. THE STAFF. THIS IS HEART BREAKING TO ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THESE LONG BEACH AND WE COULD USE SOME MORE TIME. TO GET OUR PLAN IN PLACE THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. DONNA SIGHED REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE. SINCE WE'RE NOT REALLY TAKING A VOTE ON THE BILL I'M THE SPRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AS ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. THEY. I JUST AND SAY YOU KNOW A CERTAIN I'VE I APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULT PREDICAMENT YOU AND AND YOUR CITY OR AND I I DON'T FEEL FOR THE CITIZENS OF LONG BEACH. WE. WE DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM FOR COMPELLING YOUR. OPERATOR TO STAY OPEN WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. AND. WE DON'T ALSO IF THEY DO NOT EXTEND THEIR LICENSE WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO FORCE THEM TO STAY OPEN EITHER. SO. SO AYE AYES AYE SAYS I SUFFER THE BEGINNING COURAGE YOU TO COME BACK WITH THE PLAN. AT THAT POINT. WE CAN WE CAN MOVE FORWARD BUT WE WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO FORCE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. AND SO I REALLY THINK UNFORTUNATE. THE BALL WAS IN THE CITY'S COURT. THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. FOR OFFERING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US ABSOLUTELY DO AT THREE AND HE'S UNDER CONTRACT TO THE WORKING. RAPIDLY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SAID THANK YOU. MISS BURKE. THINK YOU I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME CUTTING. AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY ONE CENTS A FIVE DAY LIMIT ON OAKLEY LA PRESCRIPTIONS FOR ACUTE PAIN MANAGEMENT FOR MINORS WITH THE EXCEPTION FOR CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT HOSPICE CARE CANCER PATIENTS. MINORS WHO ARE UNDER TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES. AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY ONE ALSO REQUIRES A DOCTOR TO INFORM THE MYERS PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN OF THE DANGERS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPIUM PRODUCTION FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE AND TO RECEIVE CONSENT BEFORE PRESCRIBING OPIOID MEDICATION. ACCORDING TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY BY THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS OPIOID POISONING AND OVERDOSES OVER CHOICES ARE SENDING INCREASED NUMBER OF U. S. CHILDREN AND TEENS TO HOSPITAL. PROPOSITIONS WERE MOST COMMON AMONG KIDS AGED TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN IN THOSE EACH ONE TO FIVE. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE AMOUNT OF OPIOIDS PRESCRIBED WITH ENOUGH FOR EVERY AMERICAN TO BE MEDICATED AROUND THE CLOCK FOR THREE WEEKS. AT ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS HAVE USE UNUSED OPIATES IN THEIR HOME. SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE U. S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL ALL AGREE THAT OVER PRESCRIBING OF OPIOIDS MEDICATIONS HAS DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE ADDICTION CRISIS. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE NEARLY HALF OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO INJECT HEROIN. REPORTED ABUSING OPPRESSION PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS BEFORE TURNING TO HEROIN. AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY ONE IS EVIDENCE BASED AND DATA DRIVEN I'VE ASKS THAT SERGEANTS TO DISTRIBUTE THE EVIDENCE AND DATA THAT SUPPORTS A FIVE DAY LIMIT AS OUTLINED BY THE CDC. ACCORDING TO THEIR MARCH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STUDY LONG TERM OPIOID USE OFTEN BEGINS WITH TREATMENT OF ACUTE PAIN. THE PROBABILITY OF LONG TOYED LONG TERM OPIOID USE INCREASES MORE SHARPLY IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF THERAPY PARTICULARLY AFTER FIVE DAYS. IN JULY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CDC RELEASE UPDATED GUIDELINES RECOMMEND NO MORE THAN THREE DAY PRESCRIPTION OF FOR ACUTE PAIN MANAGEMENT. THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDS OPIOIDS FOR ACUTE MANAGEMENT WITH MINORS ONLY AFTER NON OPIOID ALTERNATIVES HAVE FAILED. THIS EPIDEMIC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NINETY ONE DEATHS EACH DAY. FORTY TWO FROM PRESCRIBED OPIOIDS. MEMBERS WE DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF WAITING THE TEN YEARS IT CAN TAKE FOR NEW RECOMMENDATION GUIDELINES FROM THE BOARD TO BECOME COMMON PRACTICE. I LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN FOR YOU WANNA SUSAN KING WITH KING IS WITH PATHWAY TO PREVENTION IS HERE REPRESENTING A MOTHER WHO LOST HER CHILD TO OPIOID ADDICTION. BUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. CHAIRMAN WHAT AN HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY ONE. I'M SPEAKING IN PLACE OF LINDA CHAPMAN WHO LOST HER DAUGHTER TIFFANY TO COMPLICATIONS OF LIVER FAILURE. THE DIRECT RESULT OF HER ADDICTION TO PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS. TIFFANY WAS JUST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD WHEN SHE DIED. TIFFANY NOEL CHAPMAN WAS A GOLDEN CHILD WITH A BRIGHT FUTURE SHE HAD JUST BEEN VOTED SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL CLASS PRESIDENT. WHEN FIVE WEEKS INTO THE START OF HERS SENIOR YEAR SHE WAS REAR ENDED BY A DISTRACTED DRIVER. TIFFANY BROKER KNACK WAS PUT IN A HALO DEVICE WITH SCREWS IN HER HEAD AND WAS HOME SCHOOLED FOR THE REST OF HER SCHOOL YEAR. YOU CAN SEE THERE BEFORE AND THE AFTER AS SHE BEGAN HER JOURNEY. DOWN THE ROAD AS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AS A RESULT OF HER CAR ACCIDENT TIFFANY WAS PRESCRIBED. OUTWEIGHED OPIOID MEDICATIONS AND OTHER MEDICATIONS TO HELP HER SLEEP AND HANDLE HER ANXIETY SHE WAS JUST SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AT THE TIME. HER MOTHER LINDA WROTE IN HER JOURNAL I WAS NAIVE ABOUT PAIN MEDICATIONS AND I HAD NO IDEA THAT THEY COULD BECOME ADDICTIVE PARTICULARLY TO A YOUNG BRAIN THAT WAS STILL DEVELOPING. TIFFANY WAS AND A LOT OF PAIN AND I TRUSTED HER DOCTORS TO MONITOR THE AMOUNT OF PILLS SHE WAS TAKING. SOMETIMES THOUGH SHE HAD A BOTTLE OF NINETY PILLS FOR ONE. DESCRIPTION AND HAVE ANOTHER FROM A DIFFERENT DOCTOR VAI COULD IN NORCO WITH THE NAMES OF TWO OF HER MOST COMMON PRESCRIPTIONS. ONE TIME WE HAD TO TAKE TIFFANY TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM SHE SEEMED SO SECOND DISORIENTED THEY USE THE WORD OVERDOSED A WORD I ONLY ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH. THE TOLD ME SHE WAS PROBABLY ADDICTED TO HER PAIN PILLS IN LESS THAN FIVE HOURS AFTER SHE WAS STABLE THEY CENTER HOME. I WAS IN SHOCK I THOUGHT THEY WERE CHEAPER THERE UNTIL SHE GOT WELL REALLY WELL I WANTED MORE INFORMATION BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION TO GIVE ME EXCEPT THEY TOLD ME TO GO LOOK ON THE INTERNET. AT ANOTHER VISIT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM A DOCTOR TOLD US TO TELL TIFFANY TO QUOTE FLESH OUT THOSE PILLS DOWN THE TOILET WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO END UP IN A BODY BAG. UNQUOTE. STILL NO INFORMATION WAS GIVEN TO US SOMEWHERE WE COULD GO FOR HELP. IT SEEMS LIKE NO ONE CARED. I WANTED TO HELP WERE BUT DIDN'T KNOW HOW JUST TAKING THE PILLS AWAY FROM HER DIDN'T SOLVE HER ADDICTION PROBLEM. LATER ON TIFFANY GOT A JOB AND MOVED INTO HER OWN APARTMENT PREDICTION BECAME WORSE NOW SHE HAD MORE THAN ONE DOCTOR SHE WAS DOCTOR SHOPPING AND SHE WAS PHARMACY SHOPPING. I KNEW DOCTOR STARTED HER ON ANOTHER PAIN MEDICATION ONE THAT REQUIRED FEWER PILLS AND IN ONE DAY HE TOLD HER ABOUT IT OXYCONTIN. HE SAID THAT NOW SHE WOULD ONLY HAVE TO TAKE ONE PILL IN THE MORNING AND ONE IN THE EVENING. THIS LATER JUMPED TO THREE OR FOUR IN THE MORNING WITH THE SAME AMOUNT IN THE EVENING. HER ADDICTION EVENTUALLY LEAD TO MORE AND MORE E. R. VISITS FIVE DETOX IS. TO I'M COMPLETED TREATMENT PROGRAMS A DIY LIVER FAILURE AND LASTLY HER DEATH. WHEN TIFFANY WAS SEEKING TREATMENT ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF ACTIVITIES OBJECTION SHE DOCUMENTED HER STRUGGLES. AND WE FOUND HER JOURNAL AFTER SHE PASSED AWAY. WHEN OUSTED THE RECOVERY CENTER WHAT IS YOUR DRUG OF CHOICE SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. HER DOCTORS DIDN'T USE THE WORD DRUGS. I WASN'T A DRUG ADDICT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION DRUG OF CHOICE I HAD NO ANSWER I DON'T REMEMBER HAVING A CHOICE. THINKING ABOUT THE COMMERCIALS IN MY YOUNG TEEN YEARS IT SHOWED A HOT SKILLET ON THE STOVE. SAYING THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON DRUGS DID THAT COMMERCIAL APPLY TO ME THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON A MEDICATION THAT HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED TO YOU BY YOUR TRUSTED DOCTOR TO HELP YOU. NOT HARM YOU. THE SEEDS OF ADDICTION WERE PLANTED IN TIFFANY'S PLASTIC DEVELOPING BRAIN WHEN DOCTORS PRESCRIBE POWERFUL OPIATES TO HER AS A YOUNG AS A YOUNG WOMAN. SHE WAS JUST A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THAT BEGAN HER PARENTS WERE KEPT IN THE DARK AND RENDERED HELPLESS. AS DOCTORS PRESCRIBE MORE AND MORE AND MORE OP RIGHTS TIFFANY NOEL CHAPLAIN. CHAPMAN DIED AT AGE TWENTY SEVEN AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. THIS BILL IS IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO STOP ADDICTION BEFORE IT STARTS. THANK YOU. THERE ARE OTHER. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. CHAIR AND MEMBERS NAMELY PETRON WITH MAKE YOU CUT CAN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF OF GATEKEEPER INDIVIDUAL SPORT. SO ANYONE ELSE. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. YOU HAVE PLAYED ALONG. YEAH. TURN IT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS MAKE IT ALRIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY ONE. AND THE FIVE DAY CAP ON PRESCRIPTIONS IN THIS BILL REPRESENTS A LEGISLATIVE ATTEMPT TO PRACTICE MEDICINE. AND ZMA OPPOSES THESE PROVISIONS AS POSITIONS ARE THE APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS SPECIFIC TO THEIR PATIENTS. THE MEDICAL BOARD AMERICAN PAIN SOCIETY AND AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS ALL HAVE GUIDELINES ON PRESCRIBING. AND NONE HAVE LIMITS ON THE DAIS PRESCRIBES. AS MORE THAN HALF OF YOUTH INCIDENTS THAT IS OF MISUSE OF OAK BY PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS OCCUR BY YOUTH OBTAINING ETHIOPIA AIDS FROM FRIENDS. PARENTSAND NON MEDICAL SOURCES WE FEEL THAT APPROPRIATE PERSONAL PRESCRIBING OF PROTOCOLS ARE THE BEST DIRECTION TO TAKE. AND THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED IN OTHER LEGISLATION THIS YEAR. AS SUCH WE ASK YOUR OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY ONE. THINKING. YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SPONSORED HALF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY FAMILIES ISSUE POSITIONS AND THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBGYN STRYCHNINE. AND OPPOSITION. VERY MUCH. THE WINDS BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COULD MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ABOUT EIGHT EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO TO SIXTEEN YEARS AGO I'VE SERVED ON THE OXY TASK FORCE IN SAN DIEGO. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP WAS AND IT'S STILL TRUE TODAY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH EDUCATION. IS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE BECAUSE IT'S PRESCRIPTION THAT IT'S SAFE. AND THAT'S BEEN AN ONGOING YOU KNOW PROBLEM OF WHY. THESE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE BEING USED THE WAY THEY ARE BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE SAFE ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE. AND AS I MENTIONED IN THE LAST HEALTH HEARING. SERVING ON THE STANFORD. INITIATIVE ON THE DRUG POLICY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP WAS THAT THERE'S THAT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY BETWEEN AGE ELEVEN AND TWENTY FIVE THAT KIDS ARE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE. TO GETTING ADDICTED TO UP A DRUG LIKE THIS AND THAT IF WE'RE GONNA SPEND ANY MONEY AND TIME WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS RANGE OF OF TIME. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GETTING. YEAH EVEN THE AGE TWENTY SEVEN I MEAN IT'S RIGHT THERE SO. ALSO ANOTHER FACTOR IS NINETY ONE PERCENT OF OVERDOSE PATIENTS ARE LATER PRESCRIBE AN OPEN. SO THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE NEED TO KEEP WORKING ON ON. I KNOW ITS. IT'S NOT EASY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT I AM SAYING YOU HAVE EXEMPTIONS HOME ABILITY TO PORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE. I THINK ARE YOU KNOW IT'S CLEARLY AIMED AT THAT AGE GROUP. AND ALSO YOU DO HAVE THOSE EXEMPTION FOR CANCER OR CHRONIC PAIN AND THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW. AND THROUGH THE CHAIR WE HAVE ADDITIONAL EXEMPTIONS IF IT'S NECESSARY. TO PRESCRIBE MORE THAN FIVE DAYS A DOCTOR MAY DO SO THEY JUST MONTHS NOTE THE FILE. TO ANYONE ELSE HAS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THE PROMOTION IT. THURMOND SHOW THERE'S A. MOTION AND A SECOND BY MISTER. MUCH BY MR MCCARTY SECOND BY MISTER THURMAN. WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE OFF MISTER AND IN JULY AND IT WAS JULY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OR MAYBE MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AT CDC PUT OUT THEIR RECOMMENDATION AND TODAY I DO NOT SEE CMA HAVING ANY PROTOCOLS AND PLACED. IT DOES TAKE PROBABLY TEN YEARS TO PUT THOSE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THEM TO BECOME COMMON PRACTICE SO WHICH IS WHY I THINK WE ARE AT A POINT NOW WHERE IT IS TIME TO THAT. TO THOUGHTFULLY LEGISLATING I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. AS OF JULY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TWENTY THREE OTHER STATES HAVE ENACTED LEGISLATION WITH SOME TYPE OF LIMITS. OR AYE GUIDANCE OUR REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO PULL OPI PRESCRIPTIONS SO THERE'S NO REASON CALIFORNIA CAN DO THE SAME WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST NAY VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS BURKE AT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AND I BELIEVE THE CDC GUIDELINES ARE THREE DAYS. YES THEY ARE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHARON MEMBERS AND I A WALL ALSO SANK TO COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US. ON THIS BILL I LIKE TO ATTEMPT TO COMMIT. A TO COME MEDIA MOMENTS TO GIVE TO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FLEXIBILITY TO UPDATE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH COMMUNITY REVIEW PROCESS. AB TWENTY TO LIFE AND I CALLED THE FIGHT TO SIXTH GRADE. READING LEVEL REQUIREMENT FOR MEDI CAL BENEFITS HOUSE EDUCATION AND INFORMATION DOCUMENTS IN ENGLISH. IN ADDITION THERE WOULD EXTEND THIS REQUIREMENT TO THE THRESHOLD LANGUAGES TO ENSURE THAT READABILITY OFF TO COMMUNICATION TO MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. MOBILE ALSO INCORPORATE AND ONE TIME COMMUNITY REVIEW PROCESS FOR EXISTING AND NEW DOCUMENTS TO GIVE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ORGANIZATIONS A CHANCE TO REVEAL AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON DOCUMENTS. IN STRESSFUL LANGUAGES TO CONFIRM DEAR APPROPRIATIONS THE APPROPRIATENESS AND READABILITY. WOULD DAHLE NATIVE SPEAKING. LIVES SPEAKERS REVEAL OFF TO DOCUMENT THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL WHETHER OR NOT THE WRITING IS REALLY S. SIX GREAT LEVEL. SO. ES EL AS AN IMMIGRANT MYSELF I UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE BARRIER THAT EXIST FOR THOSE WHO FIRST LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH. AND ENSURING THAT DOCUMENTS SENT TO MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES ARE EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND IN ENGLISH AND IN ALL THRESHOLD LANGUAGES IS VERY IS A VERY FIRST STEP TO ENSURING THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH SERVICES. AVAILABLE TO DAN AND A WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO TO KEEP THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES HEALTHY. AND TODAY HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF. MARYANN MARYANNE THAT GARCIA WAS A WOMAN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA. IN JIM FLORIO WAS WESTERN CENTER ON LAW IMPROPER PROPERTY AND CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL WE ALSO HAVE KIMBERLY CHEN. WAS A CALIFORNIA PAN ETHIC HOUSE NETWORK HERE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. GETTING VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE AND I GARCIA OF THE HALF OF THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE. I'VE BEEN A HEALTH ADVOCATE IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS AND HAVE LOTS ALONG SIDE MEDI CAL ENROLLEES IN MEMBERS. AS THEY NAVIGATE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS AN ADVOCATE I BEEN WITNESS TO MEDI CAL MEMBERS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. BEING UNABLE TO ACCESS CRUCIAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING INFORMING MATERIALS. TODAY I WANNA HIGHLIGHT THE STORY OF LINDA A FIFTY YEAR OLD MEDI CAL MEMBER WHOSE PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS SPANISH. LENDERS HEALTH HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY NOT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND PLAN MATERIALS. LAST YEAR LINDA WAS ACCESS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR A MILD MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION AND THE PROVIDER SHE SAW SPOKE LIMITED SPANISH. LINDA HAD A DIFFICULT TIME COMMUNICATING WITH HIM AND EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL FRUSTRATION A STRESSED THAT SHE ALREADY HAD FILLING MINIMIZE THOSE THE PATIENT AND NOT TAKING SERIOUSLY. LENT LINDA FELT STRONGLY ABOUT FINACLE PLEA DO TO THE LACK OF CARE AND THE DISRESPECT SHE EXPERIENCED. SHE HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO OR WHERE TO START. SHE SPOKE TO THE CLINIC WHO THEN REFER HER TO SPEAK WITH THE PLAN. WHEN SHE CALLED THE PLAN SHE EXPLAINED WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD CENTER DOCUMENTS TO FILE A GRIEVANCE. WHEN THE MATERIALS CAME SHE WAS VERY CONFUSED ON THE PROCESS AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT STEPS TO TAKE. LINDA ULTIMA ULTIMATELY DENY FILED A GRIEVANCE AND IN CONSEQUENCE HAS NOT. SOUGHT OUT MENTAL SERVICES SINCE THEN. AND LINDA IS NOT ALONE THESE ARE COUNT THERE ARE COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF THE WAY IN WHICH MEDI CAL MEMBERS HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME. RECEIVING THE CARE THEY NEED DID TO THE INCONSISTENCIES OF PLAN DOCUMENTS. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE WOULD ENSURE THAT MEMBERS LIKE LINDA HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK ON THE READABILITY ENCLOSURE PROBE INTO IT. OF CONSUMER MATERIALS ESPECIALLY IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE CAN HELP ENSURE THAT OUR VIBRANT AND DIVERSE MEDI CAL POPULATION KNOW THEIR HEALTHCARE RIGHTS IN OUR POWER TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JANICE FLORES WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WERE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE IS BASED ON A SIMPLE PREMISE PEOPLE ON MEDICAL SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE MATERIAL SENT TO THEM BY MANAGED CARE PLANS. SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE SEEN AYE WITH OUR LEGAL SERVICES PARTNERS ON MATERIALS THAT ARE SENT TO PEOPLE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. SOME TRANSLATED MATERIALS ARE ONLY PARTIALLY TRANSLATED WITH ENTIRE PARAGRAPHS LEFT IN ENGLISH. THIS MIGHT BE DUE TO HOW THE MATERIALS ARE POPULATED BUT A COMMUNITY REVIEW WOULD HAVE CAUGHT THIS. SOME TRANSLATED MATERIAL SLEEP CERTAIN TERMS IN ENGLISH USUALLY PROPER NOUNS. HOW A PERSON READERS OF SOME LANGUAGE CANNOT READ THE LETTERS USED IN THE ENGLISH ALPHABET SO THIS JUST LEAVES A MORE SENTENCES WITH INEXPLICABLE SYMBOLS IN THE MIDDLE? READERS OF OTHER LANGUAGES WOULD STILL NEED AN EXPLANATION OF THE UNTRANSLATED TERMS. SOME TRANSLATED MATERIALS ARE WRITTEN IN A DIALECT OF THE LANGUAGE NOT SPOKEN BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ARMENIAN FOR EXAMPLE HAS BOTH THE WESTERN EASTERN DIALECT THE DIALECT SHARE NOTHING COMMON THAT MATERIALS CAN BE PRODUCED THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLE BY BOTH BUT ONLY IF MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ACTUALLY REVIEW THESE MATERIALS. CONSUMERS REPORT RECEIVING MATERIALS THAT ARE TOO FORMAL. JUST AS READERS OF ENGLISH WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND MATERIALS WRITTEN IN LEGALESE ARE WITH LOTS OF TECHNICAL HEALTH INDUSTRY LANGUAGE READERS OF OTHER LANGUAGES STONE AS WELL AND SOMETIMES THIS IS ACTUALLY BECAUSE THE TRANSLATOR IS VERY EDUCATED AND THE RELY ON THE TERMINOLOGY THAT THEY KNOW. SOME TRANSLATIONS ARE LITERAL BUT NOT UNDERSTANDABLE. FOR EXAMPLE ONE HEALTH PLANS LANGUAGE ACCESS SHE GIVES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL IN EACH LANGUAGE AND IT TELLS IN RELEASE IF THEY SPEAK TRADITIONAL CHINESE THEY CAN GET LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE. NOBODY ACTUALLY SPEAKS TRADITIONAL CHINESE THEY SPEAK MANDARIN OR CANTONESE AND SO IT SEEMS THAT THE TRANSLATOR WAS JUST TRANSLATING INSTRUCTION. ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS WOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BY A COMMUNITY REVIEW AND SO ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHETHER SPEAKERS OF ENGLISH ANOTHER LANGUAGE SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE MATERIALS. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE THOSE. VERY MUCH. KIMBERLY CHIP KIMBERLY CHANNEL THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH THAT WORK IN SUPPORT. OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

IT INCLUDES A NATIVE SPEAKER OF WEEKS EACH LANGUAGE WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE. ON FOUR MEMBER STATE HERE TO FOR MATERIAL INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN TRANSLATED. IN ADDITION THE BILL REQUIRES THAT THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN REPORT TO THE KEY. TO THE DEPARTURE THEIR REGULATOR REGARDING THE COMMUNITY PROCESS COMMUNITY REVIEW PROCESS AND WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PURPOSES OF THIS REPORT. HOW WILL BE USED HOW FREQUENT HEALTH PLANS BE REQUIRED TO FILE THAT REPORT? OVERALL THIS BILL A DAD ADDS ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WERE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STATE A MANAGED CARE PLAN RESOURCES AND OFFERS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMMUNITY REVIEWED MATERIALS BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THOSE.

MISTER GROUP PRESENTING AB TWO EIGHT FOUR THREE WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MISTER GLORIA. YOU KNOW I THINK. TOPIC TO LOOK AT YOU SURE DID HIS HE DID SO I'M PICKING UP WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING DOWN OF THIS IS A PROBLEM. WE NEED TO FIX IT ALL OF US KNOW THERE'S A HEALTH CRISIS IN THIS STATE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEIR LINE ON UTILIZED ON IS A SCANDAL THOSE IDENTIFIED BY OUR STATE AUDITOR WITH THIS BILL WE CAN TAKE SOME ACTION TO CREATE LEVERAGE MAKE SURE THESE DOLLARS ARE SPENT IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THE NEED IS GREATEST. OUT YOU AYE VOTE TODAY WE GET THIS BILL GOING AND HOPEFULLY GET SOME RELIEF TO COMMUNITIES ARE DEALING WITH A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CRISIS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GLORIA THERE OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF MR GLORIA'S BILL. NOT AT THIS HOUR SIR. IT'S EARLY MISTER CLEARY. WAIT TILL NEXT WEEK FOR NIGHT OWLS LIKE YOURSELF DOCTOR WITH. IS THERE HE WON IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARY THERE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS AND I'M MAKING COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF. THE ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. WE DO WANT TO RESPOND TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS INDICATION ABOUT. IN MANY MANY IN THE POLITICAL PRESS WILL SAY FUNDS ARE SITTING AROUND. FUNDS THERE AS A RECENT AUDIT. THOSE ISSUES ARE BEING ADDRESSED BOTH BY STATE LAW THAT WAS ENACTED LAST YEAR AB ONE ONE FOUR IN THE STATE BUDGET PROCESS. TO ADDRESS REVERSION AND ADDRESSED WHERE THOSE FUNDS GO. UP IF THEY HAVE SAT. AROUND OR BEEN UNUSED IN THREE YEARS. SO I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT MANY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PROGRAMS ARE IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH CITIES. COUNTY AFFILIATES SCHOOLS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES. NOTHING IN CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS SUCH COLLABORATION. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MHSAA PROGRAMS ALREADY OPERATING IN COLLABORATION WITH PUBLIC SCHOOLS CITY POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER LOCAL PUBLIC ENTITIES. IN ADDITION THE ACT REQUIRES THAT EACH COUNTY CONSULT WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS DURING ITS THREE YEAR PLANNING PROCESS IN THIS IS A VERY INTENSE OF LOCAL PROCESS. WE'RE NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING SCHOOLS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CITIES AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ARE AND. INVITED AND PARTICIPATE. AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY THREE SIDE STEPS THE LEADERSHIP ROLE IT LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT COUNTIES PLATE IN CALIFORNIA. IN DELIVERING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. I HAVE. AND. THIS BILL SHIPS FUNDS AWAY FROM COUNTIES THAT WILL RESULT IN THE DISRUPTION OF SERVICES TO MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ENJOYING THE BENEFITS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AND WILL DISRUPT THE LOCAL PRIORITIES THAT I EARLIER MENTIONED THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THE TERRORIST TO LOT OF OR SOMETHING AFTER URBAN KAISER CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED BY CBJ AND AND WILL KNOW THAT WE DO WORKS WITH ALL OF THESE ENTITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WE HAVE. REPORTING THAT WE HAVE TO DO WE HAVE ALL THESE. AUDITS AND THINGS GOING ON SO WE JUST DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TIME TO START DIVERTING TO OTHER ENTITIES WHO DON'T HAVE THE SAME RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE DO THANK YOU. KELLY BUCKS ON BEHALF OF THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WERE ALSO IN OPPOSITE. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WHICH LIKE CLOSE MISTER CLARK I WOULD JUST AS A MATTER OF KEEPING THIS ON THE RECORD IS THIS ISNOT A BILL THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE POLITICAL PRICE THIS IS A BILL THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY OUR STATE AUDITOR. WE HAVE TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE SITTING IN FUND BALANCES IN COUNTIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE. ALAMEDA COUNTY HUNDRED FOUR MILLION SACRAMENTO COUNTY HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN MY OWN COUNTY HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION IN MY COUNTY LAST YEAR MISTER WOULD YOU KNOW WE LOST TWENTY PEOPLE TO HEPATITIS A. WE HAVE A MASSIVE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN MY CITY IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS THE NUMBER OF A NINE ONE ONE MENTAL HEALTH IMAGE BECAUSE IT INCREASED BY OVER ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. THE FACT THAT WE'RE SITTING ON THIS KIND OF MONEY NOT EXPENDED NOT ALLOCATED IS A SCANDAL WE AS LEGISLATORS MUST DO SOMETHING TO ADD. TO WORK ON THAT I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT THEY CAN LIVE WITH. BUT ULTIMATELY THEY ARE NOT SPENDING THE FUNDS THIS IS ON ALL OF OUR CONSCIOUSNESS PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEED RELIEF NOW I ASK FOR YOUR AYE THOSE. GLORIA. PLEASE YES YOU CAN. I APPRECIATE THIS BUILD GRAPH HERE. BECAUSE I'M NOTICING WHEN MY COUNTIES LAKE COUNTY APPEARS THAT IS NOT EVEN. RENT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. LIMIT TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. AND SO I AND I JUST NEED TO CONTINUING US GETTING PEOPLE. WHY HAVEN'T THEY REPORTED TIMELY AND THEY HAVE FUNDING THAT'S? THANK YOU FOR WRITING THIS INFORMATION. THAT'S FOR THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND THANK YOU FOR SOME IN THE BACK DR. WAS THAT EMOTION YEAH BUT COULD NO THERE THAT'S THE MOTION THERE'S. TO HAVE AM A MOTION BY MS SAGER CURRY A SECOND BY MISTER SANTIAGO THIS DOESN'T CHOI DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. THE MOTION IS TO PASSED APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WOULD I WOULD I MAYES. MAYES NO ANCHOR CURRY HACKER CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW NO BONTA AYE BONTA AYE BURKE. CARILLO AYE CARILLO AYE FLORA. FLORA NO THE MOST. I LIMON AYE. MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE THIS AREA. RODRIGUEZ. SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE THURMAN. THURMOND AYE WALDRON. WILDER NO. YOU'RE YOU'RE GOES OUT HERE OF A HOAX THE CANISTER VERY MUCH OF A SUPER. I'M AGO MISTER THURMAN. CAN'T WE CITY. THE BILL. PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN WIENER AYE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS SOME BEFORE YOU PERCENT AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY FOUR. I THIS BILL DEALS WITH THE SUBJECT OF HOSPITAL CLOSURES WE TALKED ABOUT ONE TONIGHT. YOU KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MY DISTRICT ALONG WITH EXPERIENCE ONE OF THAT WAS THERE YOU KNOW PRIMARY HOSPITAL FOR OF MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY OVER FACING THE POSSIBILITY OF A CLOSURE NOW AYE AYE DECLARED CLOSURE BY ALTA BATES HOSPITAL. OF THIS UP MEASURE WOULD LENGTHEN THE TIME LINES THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS SHOULD BE GIVEN A. NOTICE ABOUT A CLOSURE AS WELL AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SPECIFICALLY IT SAYS THAT. INSTEAD OF IT BEING. NINETY DAYS FOR THE PUBLIC DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD BE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAIS IT SAYS THAT A FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MUST BE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OR ELIMINATING. OF ANY SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE. AND IT A PROHIBITS THE HOSPITAL FROM CLOSING PRIOR TO OBTAINING WRITTEN CONSENT FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. I WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS AND TESTIMONY. IS TAYLOR JACKSON AYE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. GRANT. THANK YOU I MISS RETURN MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY FOUR ON AND THAT HOW MANY NURSES ASSOCIATION OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION. SO ACROSS CALIFORNIA MAJOR PROVIDERS OF HEALTHCARE AND JOBS CLOSE THEIR DOORS WITH LITTLE NOTICE TO THE COMMUNITY. HOSPITAL CLOSURES DECIMATE NEIGHBORHOODS AND IN DANGER CITIES PARTICULARLY WHEN RESIDENTS ARE LEFT WITHOUT A LOCAL EMERGENCY ROOM WITH IN A SAFE DISTANCE OF THEIR HOMES AND SCHOOLS. IN BERKELEY AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED ALTA BATES MEDICAL CENTER OWNED BY SUTTER HEALTH HAS BEEN UNDER THREAT OF CLOSURE WHICH WOULD LEAVE THE CITY IN A HEALTH DOESN'T WITH A SEVERE LACK OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. HOSPITAL'S ESCALATE THEIR DECISION TO CLOSE THE FACILITY BY TRYING TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO AVOID PUBLIC PUSH BACK. THESE  <u><c.green>ARE DIVERSIONS ARE</c></u> OFTEN USED AS A CYNICAL TOOL TO REDUCE THE VITAL SERVICES FACILITIES OFFER. WHICH USUALLY MAKES THE FINAL CLOSURE OF THE HOSPITAL INEVITABLE. INSTEAD OF HASTENING OF CLOSURE THE POSES A THREAT TO THE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL SHOULD BE WORKING WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS DOCTORS NURSES AND WORKERS TO RECEIVE PUBLIC INPUT. AND RETAIN ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WE DID HAVE A NURSE WHO ISHERE TO TESTIFY BUT SHE HAD TO CATCH A FLIGHT. SO I JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY WHICH SHE WORKED FOR COMMUNITY HOSPITAL IN LONG BEACH AND THEY CURRENTLY HAVE NINE OPERATORS INTERESTED IN TAKING OVER THEIR OPERATIONS. AND THAT BILLS THIS TO THEM BECAUSE THE MORE TIME ADVOCATES ARE GIVEN TO ORGANIZE A PLAN WHEN A HOSPITAL SAYS THEY'RE GOING TO CLOSE. THE MORE LIKELY WE ARE TO HAVE A BETTER OUTCOME. THESE HOSPITALS ARE WHERE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE BORN OUR NEIGHBORS GO WHEN THEY GET SICK AND OUR CITIES COUNT ON TO BE THERE WHEN A WILDFIRE OR EMERGENCY STRIKES. HOSPITALS ARE A VITAL PART OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN CALIFORNIANS ARE ENTITLED AT THE BARE MINIMUM TO ADEQUATE NOTICE OF THEIR CLOSURE. SEEING A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE MAYBE TWENTY IT'S ONLY FOR. I SHOULD NOTE THAT YEAR THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MICHELLE CAPITA WITH SEIU CALIFORNIA CHERRY MEMBERS WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. THIS HITS CLOSE TO HOME NOT JUST FOR OUR MEMBERS WHO WORK AT. ALTA BATES AS WELL BUT FOR MANY OF THE DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITIES YOU SERVE. FROM SADDLEBACK MEMORIAL. IN SAN CLEMENTE TO LONG BEACH MEMORIAL. THERE HAS BEEN A TREND OF HOSPITALS PULLING THE RUG OUT FROM UNDERNEATH COMMUNITIES. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF A LARGER STATEWIDE PLANNING PROCESS TO ENSURE. THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO NEEDED SERVICES WE BELIEVE THAT A MEASURE LIKE THIS IS APPROPRIATE AND WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SARAH FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION HAPPY TO BE IN SUPPORT WITH CNN SEIU IN THIS ON THE SPELL THANK YOU. SIR ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS BE DAY PARTISAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND THE US CA CHANNEL MEMBERS HAVE SEVERAL OF. A ISSUES WITH THIS BILL. AT FIRST THE BILL'S DUPLICATIVE THERE ARE ALREADY EXISTING LAWS IN PLACE FOR HOSPITALS TO NOTIFY CDP H. COUNTY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THE PUBLIC PRIOR CHECK CLOSING REDUCING EMS SERVICES. SECONDLY THE REQUIREMENT FOR AG APPROVAL OF ELIMINATION OR REDUCTION OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS UNNECESSARY INAPPROPRIATE. THIS ADDITIONAL STATUTORY LAYER PLACES THE OFFICE AND POSITION OF DETERMINING LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH CARE NEEDS. IT COULD ALSO BE FINANCIALLY TROUBLED HOSPITALS UNABLE TO SUSTAIN CONTINUED LOSSES FOR THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AEGEUS CONSIDERING REQUESTS. AND FINALLY. WITH THIS TIME EXTENSION THE AUTHOR SUGGESTING THE BILL WILL KEEP HOSPITALS AND EDIE'S OPEN. HOWEVER AT THE EIGHTY DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER HOSPITAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES PATIENT VOLUME PATIENT MIX OR OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL VIABILITY. AND THEREFORE IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW THIS WOULD PER. FOR THAT PERMIT HOSPITALS OR EMS SERVICES. FOR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. CALF MUSCLES GOT RESENTING H AND THE UNITED HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. WOULD JUST ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT GETS A HOSPITAL WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. WHEN THEY'RE CLOSING MEANING A SEISMIC RETROFIT FUNDING FOR THAT FUNDING TO KEEP THE OPERATE THE HOSPITAL OPEN THERE'S NOTHING THAT THE AG CAN PROVIDE. TO KEEP THEM OPEN AND ASK THAT TIMELINE LINK THINGS WERE STILL LOSING STAFF. STILL LOSING STUFF EVERYDAY AND SO FOR US IT'S IT WOULD WE FEEL LIKE IT IT IS A TOUGH POSITION FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT IT'S NOT A POSITION. IT'S NOT A DECISION THE HOSPITAL TAKES LIGHTLY. AND THE LAMP LONGER THAT DECISION GOES THE LAST STAFF WE HAVE THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS TO KEEP OPERATIONS GOING. MAYOR MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ANY COMMENTS. THE THE MOTION. MISTER FLORA SECOND BY MR MCCARTY. I MISTER SANTIAGO EXCUSE ME BUT AND THEN SECOND BY MR MCCARTY. WHICH LIKE CLOTHES MISTER CHAIRMAN. THERE. THINGS CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS RAISED BY OPPOSITION OUT TO SAY THAT. WE ALL DO LONG RANGE PLANNING INFO HOSPITALS IN A CLOSE REDUCE SERVICES I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE A RIGHT TO DO. THIS BILL EXTENDS THE TIME LINES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS INPUT THIS HOSPITAL IN MY DISTRICT IS THE ONLY ACUTE HOSPITAL IN THE CITY OF BERKELEY. THAT WOULD SERVE ALL THE STUDENTS AS WELL AS THOSE WHO COME FOR THINGS LIKE HAVING. YOU KNOW THEIRCHILDREN BORN THERE. IF PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW AND MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE CONCERNS OF THIS HOSPITAL CLOSING. THIS BILL CHANGES THAT PROCESS GIVES COMMUNITY UPPER RIGHT TO BE HEALTHY AND BE INFORMED I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. HE'S VERY MUCH MR THURMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO. JUDICIARY DOESN'T ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT I WHAT I MEAN IS NOW MAYES NO AGAR CURRY? ANGER CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW NOW BONTA. BURKE.

THE MOTION AND A SECOND WAS THIS RODRIGUEZ. YOUR MEMBERS. TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA SAW OVER TWO THOUSAND OPIOID OVERDOSE DEATHS AND NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND MERGING VISITS. FOR OPEN HEART OVERDOSES NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT REQUIRE EVERY HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER AUTHORIZED PRESCRIBE OPIATES TO ADOPT A SAFE. ASCRIBING PROTOCOL WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING UNNECESSARY CLERK PRESCRIPTIONS. THE PROBABLY HELP WOULD UTILIZE DATA FROM THE CHURCH DATABASE AND TRUCK THE REDUCTIONS OF OVER PRESCRIPTION THE TOW TWENTY TWENTY TWO. MEMBERS THE LANGUAGE OF PRINTING BEFORE YOU TODAY IS NOT PERFECT HOWEVER IT IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS FINDING A MEANINGFUL COMPROMISE WITH. THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY THAT WILL ACHIEVE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION APPEAR PRESCRIBING. THEY ARE STILL HERE IS A MUST BE DEFINED AND NEGOTIATE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. WITH ME TODAY IS PROFESSIONAL SHARE ACTING ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT USC'S. TECH SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND LEAD RESEARCHER FOR A STUDY WHICH REVEALS THAT A LARGE SHARE OF OPENER PRESCRIPTIONS. ORIGINATES FROM THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE. HI MY NAME IS SAXENA I'M ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE IMPACT OF STATE LOCAL POLICIES ON THE PRESCRIPTION OPIOID EPIDEMIC IN THE UNITED STATES. A RECENT STUDY OF MINE COOPERATE WITH COLLEAGUES AT THE KECK SCHOOL OF MEDICINE FINDS THAT FROM NINETEEN NINETY SIX TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THERE WAS A FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE PERCENT INCREASE. IN THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF OPIOIDS PRESCRIBED IN THE UNITED STATES THE SINGLE GREATEST DRIVER OF THIS INCREASED WAS OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS ORIGINATING IN OFFICE SPACE SETTINGS LIKE PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES. IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX SEVENTY ONE PERCENT OF TOTAL OF YOU AIDS CAN FROM OFFICE SPACE SETTINGS THAT NUMBER GOOD EIGHTY THREE PERCENT BY TWENTY TWELVE. THE SHARES ATTRIBUTABLE TO OTHER SOURCES LIKE E. OURS IN PATIENT STAYS ACTUALLY DECLINED OVER THAT PERIOD. IN ADDITION TO BEING A LARGE SHARE OF THE TOTAL THE AVERAGE OFFICE SPACE PRESCRIPTION WAS STRONGER AND LONGER THAN THOSE FROM OTHER SITES OF CARE. FURTHER MUCH OF THE GROWTH IN PRESCRIBING BY OFFICE BASED PHYSICIANS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO REPEATED OR REFILL PRESCRIPTIONS RATHER THAN ONE TIME PRESCRIPTION. REVEALED OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS FROM OFFICE SPACE SETTINGS THROUGH FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX PERCENT OVER THE HOUSES PERIOD. FINALLY WE FIND THE FREQUENT USERS OF OPIOIDS RECEIVE MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEIR. BICU IT'S FROM OFFICE SPACE SETTINGS COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE USER WHO RECEIVES FORTY FOUR PERCENT FROM OFFICE BASED SETTINGS. BASED ON THESE RESULTS EFFORTS TO REDUCE INAPPROPRIATE OPIOID PRESCRIBING THAT ARE FOCUSED ON OFFICE SPACE SETTINGS COULD BE A VERY SUCCESSFUL TOOL IN COMBATING THE CURRENT OPIOID EPIDEMIC. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR LISTINGS MY COMMENTS AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ FOR INVITING ME TO SHARE THE RESULTS OF MY RESEARCH TODAY. VERY MUCH OTHERS AND SUPPORT. A GOOD AFTERNOON OUT MICROBES IN HERE ON BEHALF OF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS A WEEK WE HAD A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION ON THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE BELL AND. AND REALLY I EVEN WITH THIS VERSION OF THE BILL WE I THINK ARE AMENDMENT IDEA IS STILL PERTINENT AND THAT JUST SHARE REALLY QUICKLY. IS ON AND AND AND REALLY QUESTS PERSONALLY THIS BILL AND ALL THE OTHER PRESCRIBER PRACTICES BILLS THAT ARE THAT ARE MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. AND THAT THE CDC GUIDELINES AS MISS BURKE ALREADY POINTED OUT I'M. HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHYSICIANS IN IN IN THE CDC AND MEDICAL BOARD GUIDELINES RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE A BASELINE URINE TESTS FOR FOR FOR PRESCRIPTIONS FOR OPIOIDS. AND AND REALLY WE THINK THAT A. THAT THAT COMPONENT OF THE CDC GUIDELINES SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS IN ANY OF THE SAFE PROP PRESCRIBER PRACTICES ARE PROVIDER. YOU KNOW BILLS AND THAT THE BASELINE PASSED IT WILL ULTIMATELY TO IT REALLY IS THE ULTIMATE IN EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE. FOR A PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. THE DOCTOR SHOULD KNOW WHAT DRUGS THEY MAY ALREADY BE ON WHETHER THEY'RE ALREADY ON CERTAIN OP รณ EIGHTS WHETHER THEY'RE TAKING DRUGS THAT ARE. YOU KNOW WHETHER THE GETTING DRUGS FROM THEIR NEIGHBOR FROM THE MEDICINE CABINET OR WHATEVER THAT THERE'S THINGS THAT THE CURE'S DATABASE JUSTICE IS GOING TO SHOW A BLOOD TEST WILL SHOW IN HAVE IN IT. AND IT WILL HELP DOCTORS MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ON WHAT THEY PRESCRIBE HOW THEY PRESCRIBE IN SOON SO WHICH ONE TO SHARE THAT. SAYS BILL MOVES FORWARD ANY OF THE OTHER PRESCRIBER PRACTICES BILLS THAT ARE. COMING FOR LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT THE CDC GUIDELINES AS IT PERTAINS TO THE A BASELINE URINE TESTING PERIODIC TESTING FROM THERE THANK YOU.

I HAVE TWO BILLS BEFORE YOU FIRST ONE AB NINETEEN FIFTY THREE WHAT'S GOT THAT ONE. PART YES WILL GO THAT WOULD GET VERY GET THIS BILL SIMPLY EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLICANTS FOR A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY LICENSE MUST. MAKE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH MUST AND MUST MAKE TO THE PUBLIC DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO INCLUDE WHETHER OR NOT THE APPLICANT FOR THEIR PARTNER. HAS AN OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL IN CONTROLLING INTEREST OF FIVE PERCENT OR MORE IN A BUSINESS THAT PROVIDES ANY SERVICE TO A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. SOME SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES CONTRACT UP BASIC FUNCTIONS LIKE MANAGEMENT OR RENT THEIR OWN BUILDING FROM A SISTER CORPORATION PRIVATE INTEREST IN A COMPANY THAT DOES THEIR LAUNDRY. SAYING IT IS SIMPLY AN EFFICIENT WAY TO RUN A GREAT RUNNING THEIR BUSINESSES AND CAN HELP MINIMIZE TAXES. SKILLED NURSING OWNERS FOR A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY OWNERS THEN ESTABLISH HIGHLY FAVORABLE CONTRACTS IN WHICH THERE NURSING HOMES PAY MORE FOR SERVICES AND THEY MIGHT IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET. THIS ALLOWS AND DECIPHER OFF HIGHER PROFITS WHICH ARE NOT RECORD ON THE NURSING HOMES ACCOUNTS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE SNIFFS. MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE BASED ON THEIR COSTS. SO THEY'RE INFLATING THEIR COSTS THEY ARE ALSO POTENTIALLY RAISING THEIR REIMBURSEMENT RATES COSTS IN THE STATE MONEY OF THE BILL. AGAIN THIS BILL SIMPLY ADDS MORE TRANSPARENCY TO SCHOOL THEIR SURFACES FACILITY BUSINESS PRACTICES ASPIRO. GOOD ANY. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JOHN HUNTER WITH CARP WHICH SPORT BILL.

TAKE VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY IN THINK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AT FIRST LIKE TO. START BY ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. AS. I THINK. THANKS VERY MUCH AS YOU ARE WE ALREADY HEARD TODAY THERE IS A DRUG EPIDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OPIOIDS. YOU WE DON'T OVERDOSE DEATHS SURROUNDING THIS EPIDEMIC ARE STAGGERING. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY IS A THAT IS A BILL DESIGNED TO STICK TO ONE THING. SIMPLY SAVE LIVES. ON THE LOCK SO HYDROCHLORIDE IS AN OPIOID TO ANTAGONISE ATTACKS IMMEDIATELY TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF AN OPIATE OVERDOSE. THE BILL AS PROPOSED WOULD REQUIRE HEALTH CARE PRESCRIBERS WHEN ISSUING AN OPEN OPIOID PRESCRIPTION TO IT TOO AT RISK PATIENTS OFTEN THE LOCKS ON PRESCRIPTION OR OTHER OPIOID ANTAGONISTIC ALSO REQUIRES EDUCATION ON ITS PURPOSE. AND HOW TO USE IT. HOW TO USE IT TO BE PROVIDED TO THE PATIENT AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS DESIGNATE OR OTHER IT AT VISUALS DESIGNATED BY THE PATIENT? SO OFTEN IT ISN'T OFTEN ONE HAS THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO QUOTE DIRECTLY FROM THE SURGEON GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER IN EARLY APRIL AND THE FIRST NATIONAL ADVISORY ISSUED BY A SURGEON GENERAL SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE. YEARS GENERAL THAT SURGEON GENERAL JEROME ADAMS ISSUED AN ADVISORY EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OVERDOSE REVERSING A LOCKS ON. COULD GO ON I DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. YES YOU. I WILL LET THROUGH TO SORT MY WITNESS. AND JUST KNOWING. WHERE TIMING IS A SEAT ON A HUNDRED PAGES YOU GOT THERE BUT NOW WE GOT SUPPORT US ALSO I AM JUST GOING TO GET TO THE HIGHLIGHTED? SURE.

THE ONE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTUALLY PRESCRIBING HERE IN ADDITION TO. TO COUNTERACT THREATS TO WORK ON A LOT OF OTHER DRUGS. MY THEORY IS THAT IT COULD BE MISUSED FOR SOME OF THE KIDS WHO ARE YOUTH WHO TODAY. PURPOSELY. OVERDOSE. FOR THEIR ACTIONS. AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER BECAUSE IT WON'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL. AND MAY BE USED AS A FUND TOOL INSTEAD OF A REAL DRAMATIC TOOL FOR SAVING LIFE. I JUST WORRY ABOUT THAT I'M I'M OKAY WITH A PRESCRIPTION I'M GOOD WITH IT THAT. I WORRY ABOUT THAT.
