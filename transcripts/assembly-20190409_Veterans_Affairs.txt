SEVEN ZERO AND THE CAN OF WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF RAWNESS AT A WE'RE ANXIOUS TO HEAR YOUR PRESENTATION ON A. B.. THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND FIRST I'M WORKING WITH A CONSULTANT COMMITTEE CONSULTANT WE DID MAKE SOME AUTHOR AMENDMENTS -- TO THE BILL. AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX A SAYS VETERANS WITH WORK EXPERIENCE AND CYBERSECURITY TO EASILY TRANSITION FROM SERVICE TO EMPLOYMENT IN WHICH SECURITY CLEARANCES AND BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE REQUIRED. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE MILLION VETERANS IN THE UNITED STATES OF THAT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION RESIDING CALIFORNIA WHICH IS MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION. CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES OFFER A VARIETY OF WORK FORCE AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO ASSIST MILITARY PERSONNEL TO OBTAIN DEGREES AND REACH PATHWAYS TO PROFESSIONAL CIVILIAN CAREERS. IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. THE CYBERSECURITY CENTER AT CALLOUS CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SAN BERNARDINO. IS A VITAL ACADEMIC PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS FOR VETERANS THROUGH SERVICE IN WHICH A NATIONAL SECURITY CLEARANCE STATUS WAS OBTAINED TO EASILY UTILIZED THEIR WORK EXPERIENCE IN THE PROGRAM. AND THAT'S AN EXISTING PROGRAM AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SAN BERNARDINO. WHILE THE STATE PROVIDES PROGRAMS FOR VETERANS TO ENTER DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL FILLS A NICHE IT IS FOCUSED ON CYBERSECURITY ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED. HIRING CONSIDERATIONS AND CYBERSECURITY INCLUDE LATE THE SECURITY CLEARANCES DELAYS AND ON BOARDING PROCESSES SEVERELY IMPACTING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE CYBERSECURITY WORKFORCE. FURTHER THERE IS CURRENTLY NO UNIFORM HIRING SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE STATE. THAT ACCOUNTS FOR A VETERANS PAST EXPERIENCE IN CYBERSECURITY OR WHETHER HE OR SHE WANTS ARE CURRENTLY HOLDS A NATIONAL SECURITY CLEARANCE. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THIS BILL REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS TO COLLABORATE. WITH STATE AGENCIES AND COLLEGES TO ESTABLISH A VETERAN'S PREFERENCE TO EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE FIELD OF CYBER SECURITY THAT REQUIRE A SECURITY CLEARANCE. IN ADDITION BUILT THIS BILL REQUIRES STATE AGENCIES HIRING FOR CYBERSECURITY POSITIONS TO ESTABLISH A UNIFORM HIRING POLICY FOR VETERANS WHO HAVE RECENTLY HOW. A SECURITY CLEARANCE WITH ME TODAY IS RICHARD VALDEZ A MARINE VETERAN AND PURPLE HEART RECIPIENT. REPRESENTING DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS THE SPONSOR OF AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX HERE TO TESTIFY AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. MADAM CHAIR AGAIN THANK YOU -- MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS -- BEGAN IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND ROLLED INTO EARLY. NINETEEN SEVENTY THIS WAS THE TAIL END OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S JOBS -- PROGRAM. I WAS HIRED INTO THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. AND BECAUSE I WAS A VETERAN. I WAS ON THE FLOOR OF A CLASSIFIED BEAUTY CENTER WITHIN TWO WEEKS AFTER ORIENTATION. SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THAT FACT. AS A TIME WHEN ON MY CLEARANCES ALSO -- GREW AND MY OPPORTUNITIES GREW ALONG WITH THAT -- TO THE EXTENT MY LAST JOB WAS IN AUSTRALIA -- WORRY WAS REQUIRED OF ME TO HAVE A AN S. C. I. CLEARANCE -- FOR THE THE BOTTOM LINE THE WAY I SEE IT HERE IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING. THERE'S THE PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE WITH REGARDS TO THE OUT CYBERSECURITY WORKFORCE INVESTMENT A FOR THE NATION WHICH HAS A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND SHORT OF HAVING -- THE TRAINED PERSONNEL THEY NEED FOR THAT SO THERE'S A STRONG EMPHASIS THERE. AND PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE IN THAT -- THAT DIRECTIVE LEANS TOWARDS VETERANS. DISABLED VETERANS AND VETERANS IN GENERAL THOSE TRANSITIONING. THAT THAT'S ALREADY RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO US. AS I'VE LEARNED -- THROUGH THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY STAMINA DINO I ASKED ONE QUESTION HOW MANY VETERANS DO YOU HAVE IN YOUR CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM. AND THURSDAY -- WORK UNAWARE AND FINALLY THEY FIND OUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY. BUT WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE SERVICE WITH THAT TRAINING. WE HAVE THOSE COMING OUT OF THE SERVICE WITH THE DESIRE TO MOVE INTO THAT -- CAREER FIELD BUT IN REALITY. AS I ASKED AROUND THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY -- MOTION ON THE PART OF ALL OF THE STATE OF HEART OF CAL THAT. TO WHAT TO ACTUALLY INFORM OUR VETERANS OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND SO THAT'S WHEN I STARTED ASKING MORE QUESTIONS BECAME FAMILIAR WITH -- WITH PROFESSOR KEITH CLEMENT AT FRESNO STATE PROFESSOR TONY -- COLSON SALMON DINO US STATE UNIVERSITY CALVET. CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SALMON TO DO YOU KNOW AND AND FROM THAT HI -- BEGAN ASKING THE QUESTIONS. THAT IS. PART OF WHY THIS BILL CAME ABOUT. TO BE ABLE TO INITIATE A PROGRAM WITHIN THE STATE TO STARTED DOWN A FINE THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND PUT THEM TOGETHER IN A PATHWAY A PIPELINE TO EITHER -- A DEGREE CERTIFICATED PROGRAM AND OR DIRECTLY INTO A JOB BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE REQUISITE SKILLS AND ABILITY. AND AS WE ALL KNOW VETERANS ARE MISSION ORIENTED WILL GET THE JOB DONE. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AFTERNOON CHAIRWOMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SET THREE BUT THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. HAVE REPRESENT AMERICAN LEGION DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN OF SEVENTY SIX OUR CLIENT SUPPORTS ALL NEW IN IT AND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO CREATE JOBS FOR THE VETERANS OF CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY IS A GROWING FIELD. BUT THE DEMAND FOR EMPLOYMENT THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO ATTRACT AND KEEP VETERANS IN THE STATE HELP TRANSITIONING VETERANS. AND A GREAT POPULATION TO TARGET FOR THESE JOBS HAS THERE AND TRAINED TO IMPROVISE ADAPT AND OVERCOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ALSO A JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS BILL IS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SO I WOULD START OFF BY THANKING MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. LIFE AFTER THE MILITARY CAN POSE MANY CHALLENGES TO VETERANS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. FOR SOME RETURNING TO CIVILIAN LIFE MAY FEEL LIKE ANOTHER BATTLE THAT POSES A VARIETY OF CHALLENGES. THAT WAS NOT ONLY BE FOUGHT BUT ALSO UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFULLY OVERCOME. UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL OF OUR VETERANS HAVE THE ADEQUATE SUPPORT SYSTEM NEEDED TO TRANSITION INTO THE WORKFORCE. THIS BILL WILL HELP OUR VETERANS WHO HAVE WORK EXPERIENCE IN THE CYBER SECURITY FIELD TO EASILY TRANSITION INTO EMPLOYMENT. WE MUST PROVIDE THESE RESOURCES TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVEDOUR COUNTRY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. PERFECT TIMING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

I HAVE TWO THINGS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER ADDING ON TO IT TO MAKE IT BETTER [inaudible] OR NOT. SO. ON THE SECURITY CLEARANCES YOU MAY WANT TO DO AN AMENDMENT SAYING. CONFIDENTIAL AND ABOVE CLEARANCE BECAUSE MILITARY CLEARANCES GO CONFIDENTIAL SECRET TOP SECRET. BUT THERE'S OTHER. CLEARANCES WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT. OKAY SO JUST YOU MAY WANT TO TIGHTEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT. NOW THERE MAY BE ONE THING YOU WANT TO LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT HERE ON THIS BILL. AND THAT'S CYBERSECURITY YOU MAY WANT TO SIMPLY SAY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S AN UNKNOWN FACTOR HERE. WE DON'T KNOW [inaudible] WHAT? THESE VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY. ARE INVOLVED IN. THEY MAY BE DOING IN A NEW -- PATHWAY. OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW. SO YOU MAY WANT TO BROADEN THAT DEFINITION SIMPLY TO TAKE IN SPECIALLY IN THE FUTURE AS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES. WHAT [inaudible] THEY'RE DOING. AND THAT'S IT NO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE -- QUESTIONS IN THOSE ARE AREAS THAT WILL DEFINITELY LOOK INTO ROGER THAT. RIGHT TO AND SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRO AND A SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS AND THE MOTION IS -- DO PASSED TO PRIVACY -- SO I I THINK THAT -- AND THAT COMMITTEE WILL BE DIGGING A LITTLE DEEPER INTO YOUR BILL BUT A GREAT IDEA WE ARE PROBABLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND POSITION SHORT.
