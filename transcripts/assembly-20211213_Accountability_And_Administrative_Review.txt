RIGHT RIGHT THANK YOU BELIEVE THIS I WAS EXPERIENCING A SYMPTOM OF WITHDRAWAL A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE AND I SHARE THIS STORY- ONLY BECAUSE I THINK IT REALLY. SHINES A LIGHT ON THE- FAILINGS IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND IN THE INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND INDEED ON THE FAILINGS OF CALIFORNIA'S REGULATORY AGENCIES TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT AND APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE FACILITIES- THIS TRAGEDIES I SAID REALLY SPOTLIGHTS THE LIFE THREATENING ISSUES THAT ARE PLAGUING THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS SUBSTANCE ABUSE HAS SKYROCKETED ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AS THE NEED FOR TREATMENT HAS EXPLODED THIS INDUSTRY UNFORTUNATELY HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY BAD ACTORS WHO ARE EXPLOITING PATIENTS FOR PROFIT WITH VULNERABLE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES BEING LOWERED FROM ALL CORNERS OF THE COUNTRY TO ROGUE REHAB CENTERS AND SHAM. SERVER LEVINE HOMES. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA'S LACK OF REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT IN THIS SPACE FRAUD AND ABUSE HAVE BEEN RAMPANT IN MY DISTRICT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. I SAT WITH LOCAL MOMS IS THE SHARED HEARTBREAKING STORIES OF BRINGING THEIR CHILDREN HOME FROM THESE FACILITIES IN BODY BAGS. AND THEY'VE ASKED ME TO HELP THEM STOP THIS MADNESS THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE UNSCRUPULOUS OPERATORS IN THIS INDUSTRY ARE HAVING A HORRIFIC IMPACT ON PATIENTS WHO ARE DESPERATE FOR HELP. ON THEIR FAMILIES AND ON OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE SKYROCKETING AS A RESULT OF THE CONVICT NINE TEEN PANDEMIC THE SUBJECT IS MORE CRITICAL NOW THAN EVER AND SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY'S HEARING. AND HEARING FROM OUR WITNESSES AS THAT AS PART OF THIS DISCUSSION. OUT WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO NOW WELCOME OUR FIRST PANEL I BELIEVE OUR WITNESSES ARE BOTH JOINING U- BY OUR REMOTE TESTIMONY FACILITY. ARE WE ARE GOING TO WELCOME AT DOCTOR. BART PTOLEMY WITH THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS WELL AS DIRECTOR MICHELLE BASS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES I DOCTOR BAR PTOLEMY WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE ROLE THAT THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE HAS IN ENSURING THE PROVISION OF QUALITY CARE FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS AND DIRECTOR BOSS WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE LICENSING. RENEWAL AND FORTON ENFORCEMENT AND OVERSIGHT PROCESSES FOR ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE RECOVERY TREATMENT FACILITIES IN THE STATE ARE WITH THAT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND- TURN IT OVER I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO FIRST HEAR FROM DOCTOR BOUGHT BY. PTOLEMY THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES WE CAN WONDERFUL WELL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS DR MARIO SOME ARTILLERY. AND I'M A CLINICALLY ACTIVE BOARD CERTIFIED ADDICTION MEDICINE SPECIALIST AND ALSO BOARD CERTIFIED IN FAMILY MEDICINE. BESIDES HAVING THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING PATIENTS AND FAMILIES IMPACTED BY SUBSTANCE USE HOWEVER VARIOUS OTHER HATS INVOLVING- EYES FOR EXAMPLE THE VICE CHAIR OF THE PRACTICE MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS COMMITTEE FOR THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE THAT'S THE NATIONAL. SOCIETY FOR PHYSICIANS- PRIMARILY- ADD THAT IN THEIR INVOLVED IN ADDICTION MEDICINE AND I ALSO SERVE ON THE PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE FOR C. SAM THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. AS WELL AS ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS I SERVICE THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY COALITION OF COMMUNITY CLINICS MATT CONNECT PROGRAM. I IT'S A GRANT FUNDED EFFORT AIMED AT EXPANSION OF MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR ADDICTIONS AND HAVE SERVED AS THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE ORANGE COUNTY YOUTH OPIOID RESPONSE. TO THE AUSPICES OF THE COALITION IN THE CAR AND THE COLLABORATIVE- ORGANIZATIONS- THAT AT THEIR ALSO INVOLVED- SUCH AS MINE DOES SEE I LEAD THE- COUNTY S. U. DEVIATION COMMITTEE AND PROVIDE CONSULTATION FOR THE COUNTY JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SOCIAL SERVICES. CONTINUE TO TEACH RESIDENT PHYSICIANS AND OTHERS ON THE TOPICS INVOLVED INVOLVING SUBSTANCE USE AND ALSO SERVED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS ON MANY OF THE VERY CASES THAT YOU ALL ARE TALKING ABOUT- THAT HAVE RESULTED IN BAD OUTCOMES AT TREATMENT FACILITIES. SO I'M VERY VERY AWARE OF MANY OF THE ISSUES I'VE ALSO SERVED AS A MEDICAL DIRECTOR AT PRETTY MUCH EVERY LEVEL OF A SAM CRITERIA OR A SAM LEVELS OF CARE I SHOULD SAY- WHICH WHICH MEANS OUTPATIENT ALL THE WAY. TO A HOSPITAL BASED DETOX. AS A NATION COULD TO GROW. WITH THE CON. OF STUFF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS LIKE OPIOID USE. THE STATISTICS DO CONTINUE TO BECOME MORE ALARMING AS ALREADY MENTIONED. RECENTLY THE CDC ANNOUNCE THAT WE EXCEEDED A HUNDRED THOUSAND DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS. NATIONALLY AND CALIFORNIA BETWEEN APRIL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. I HAVE EXCEEDED TEN THOUSAND OVERDOSE DEATHS THAT WERE REPORTED. THAT REPRESENTED A FORTY THREE POINT 8% INCREASE OR AT 840% APA PERCENT CHANGE OVER THE CURRENT THE PRIOR PERIOD. FROM A SUBSTANCE PERSPECTIVE THE DRIVER APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS LIKE FENTANYL. AND WORKED SWIFTLY MOVING INTO THE FOURTH WAVE OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC THAT INVOLVES BOTH FENTANYL AND CYCLE STIMULANTS LIKE METHAMPHETAMINE. SO WERE RUSHING TO ADAPT TO WHAT IS EVOLVING. BEFORE OUR VERY EYES. THE PATIENTS AND THE FAMILIES THAT I SERVE ALONE ARE NO MATCH FOR THE COMPLEXITIES OF ACCESSING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT IN OUR COUNTRY AND THE SAME HOLDS FOR OUR STATE. IT'S DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER THE MAZE THAT IS ADDICTION TREATMENT MATCHING APPROPRIATE SERVICES WITH NEED ARE DIFFICULT ENOUGH OUR TREATMENT SYSTEM LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED FOR PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY AND FOCUS ON QUALITY OF CARE. AND ALSO JUST BEING ABLE TO SORT OUT WHAT IS TREATMENT VERSUS WHAT IS RECOVERY SERVICES THOSE LINES CAN OFTEN BE BLURRED AND THEY WHEN THEY DO GET BLURRED THEY OFTEN RESULT IN SOMEBODY ACCESSING. INADEQUATE SERVICES. FRANKLY IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING JUST TRY TO GOOGLE IT YOURSELF IT'S OFTEN THE FIRST WAY THAT MANY OF THE FAMILIES THAT THAT I DEAL WITH FIRST ENGAGE WITH THE SYSTEM ONCE THEY FIND OUT WHAT A LOVED ONE FOR EXAMPLE THAT HAS. THE DISEASE OF ADDICTION. AND WE KNOW ADDICTION IS A BRAIN DISEASE WE NOW UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S COUCHED IN AN AMALGAMATION OF VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS LIKE SOCIETAL FACTORS WE STILL HAVE STIGMA STIGMA STILL KILLS. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER BARRIERS AROUND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WE HAVE ISSUES AROUND THE MEDICAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT HAS YET TO FULLY EMBRACE ADDICTION MEDICINE THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ALSO SOCIAL SERVICES TO NAME. BUT A FEW. AND WHERE THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SYSTEM SETS OFTEN DEPENDS ON WHAT IS EMPHASIZED AT A TIME. AND A MOMENT OF CRISIS. WHICH IS THE WORST TIME. TENTH WE STILL REMAIN SILO TO. AND OFTEN IT'S DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE NOT TO MENTION THE PAYER SIDE- WHERE WE ARE CARVE OUT IN CERTAIN IT DEPENDING ON WHAT WHAT WHAT PAYER YOU HAVE ALSO THE CONTINUITY OF CARE AND INTEGRATION INTO PRIMARY CARE. IT ALSO HAS SOME ISSUES NOW KOBE NINETEEN IS AMPLIFIED THE NEEDS THE DISPARITIES THE DESPERATION AND THE GAPS ADDICTION TREATMENT IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF EVOLUTION THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE A SAM AND THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AND MANY OTHER COLLABORATORS HAVE BEEN HOPING AND PUSHING FOR LAWS MANY OF WHICH WERE WRITTEN AS FAR BACK AS IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES WHEN WE KNEW MUCH LESS ABOUT ADDICTION TREATMENT TO CATCH UP. WITH EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS AND A SHIFT FROM A FOCUS OF A LICENSURE FLOOR MEETING MINIMUM FACILITY STANDARDS FOR EXAMPLE TO ONE OF THE FOCUS ON QUALITY. ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND UP TO DATE ON TREATMENT MODALITIES SUCH AS MEDICATIONS FOR ADDICTION TREATMENT INCLUDING BUPRENORPHINE AND NALTREXONE IN CONJUNCTION IN CONJUNCTION WITH A THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES USED TO USE OF THERAPY SUCH AS CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AS EVIDENCE BASED TOOLS TO WORK ON BUILDING RESILIENCY IN RECOVERY. AND FOR CARE TO BE COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AMONG ALL DISEASES IS MULTIFACTORIAL AND IT REQUIRES A SKILLED AND QUALIFIED MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM AND NOT. JUST A FOCUS ON SUBSTANCES. HM THE BILL THE INTO STANDARD CRITERIA FOR USE IN THE TREATMENT INDUSTRY WE CALL IT BASED ON CRITERIA. CURRENTLY IS ON ITS THIRD EDITION AND IS CURRENTLY BEING REWRITTEN TO THE FOURTH ADDITION AS WE SPEAK IN FACT I SERVE. AS ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS HELPING RIGHT THE SECTION ON UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT FOR THE FOURTH. MD SHOULD STILL CONTINUE TO BE THE STANDARD TOOL THAT INFORM ON APPROPRIATENESS OF LEVEL OF CARE. AND WHAT DEFINES THE LEVEL OF CARE. I DEDICATE MUCH OF MY TIME TO HELPING TRAIN COLLEAGUES IN PRACTICE TO EXPAND THE WORK FORCE AT THE C. SAM. WE WANT TO PROVIDE HELP TO A HIGH QUALITY EVIDENCE BASED CARE AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE A WORKFORCE PROBLEM. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE ADDICTION MEDICINE SPECIALISTS THAT SOLVE THIS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE WORK FORCE TO INCLUDE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND OTHERS INTERESTED TO PROVIDE SOME SOME OF THE SERVICES. AND THAT YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE CHALLENGES THE COMPANY THE CURRENT OVERSIGHT AND REGULATORY AT CHALLENGES AS WELL LASTLY I'LL SAY THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE. THAT THOSE PROVIDING THE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT POP UP TO DATE. AND MEANINGFUL TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL. THE LAWS. TO CARRY OUT MORE EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT. BEYOND THE MECHANICS OF BEING AN EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS WHICH IS REALLY A BASELINE NEED. THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EFFORT. AGAIN TO ENSURE A QUALITY ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. I REMAIN OPTIMISTIC THAT THESE ISSUES WILL BE IN THE FOREFRONT OF MATCHING LAW WITH SCIENCE. AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO IMPROVE MY PATIENTS. AND THEIR LOVED ONES. CERTAINLY DESERVE IT I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. WELL AND THANK YOU AT DR TONY FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND AT HEAR FROM DOCTOR BOSS AND THEN WILL OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS OFFER FOR BOTH OF YOU HAVE- BUT YOU'VE CERTAINLY GIVEN US A LOT A LOT ADD TO RIDE TO THINK ABOUT- AND DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE IS PART OF THE HEARING.

FINALLY AT THE GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY REQUIREMENTS DIETSCH YES CERTIFICATION STANDARDS REQUIRE PROGRAMS TO HAVE A COMMUNITY RELATIONS POLICY. THE COMMUNITY RELATIONS POLICIES REQUIREMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO ASSIST TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH NEIGHBORS AND THEIR SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. AND AT THANK YOU DIRECTOR BASS RETURNING US TODAY I'M- TRACTOR I AT THE BEGINNING AS AS THE HEARING AID AND IF YOU WERE LISTENING I. SHARED THE STORY OF A FACILITY THAT I BELIEVE YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH AT GRATITUDE LODGE I ALSO WANT. TO SHARE ANOTHER STATEMENT WITH YOU AB FROM. ATLAN MANY ACE. WHO'S AT SIGNED MATTHEW MANY ACE TRAGICALLY LOST HIS LIFE IN A ADDICTION TREATMENT FACILITY AND THIS IS FROM MRS MANY ICE MY TWENTY YEAR OLD SON FALSELY ASSURED OF AROUND THE CLOCK MEDICAL SUPERVISION TRAVELED CROSS COUNTRY SEEKING A MEDICAL DETOX WITH HIS ADDICTION FOR ABOVE IT ALL TREATMENT CENTER IN LAKE ARROWHEAD WHEN HE ARRIVED MATHEW'S DRUG TEST WAS CLEAN THREE DAYS LATER ON FEBRUARY SIXTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN HE WAS DEAD. I WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN I LATER FOUND OUT THAT SIX PEOPLE HAD DIED AT A AYE A BEFORE MATTHEW. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES INVESTIGATED AND ISSUED A DEATH INVESTIGATION REPORT DATED DECEMBER FOURTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN. FINDING AMONGST OTHER THINGS FALSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS AND AN ACCURATE RECORD RESIDENT RECORDS WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERED THAT IN A NURSE FORGED A PRESCRIPTION AND GAVE MY SON CLINT AS A PAN AND- SUBOXONE. POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AND COUNTRY INDICATED MEDICATIONS DISCOVERING THE FORGE PRESCRIPTION I FACE AN UPHILL BATTLE TO HAVE DH CS RE OPEN THE INVESTIGATION INTO MY SON'S DEATH ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED AGAIN. DH CS INVESTIGATED AND DID NOTHING WHICH RESULTED AND STILL MORE NEGLIGENT DEATHS. AND SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS. WHEN YOU. HERE THAT STORY WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT MOM WHEN YOU HEAR THE STORY OF HENRY LAYER WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO HIS PARENTS. THAT THIS IS A TRAGIC LOSS OF LIFE PARTICULARLY FOR SOMEONE WHO IS SEEKING SERVICES TGL TO RECOVER TO GET BETTER WE TAKE THESE VERY SERIOUSLY- AND I I'M SORRY I FEEL BAD FOR THE MOTHER AND I THINK IT'S- IT'S A TRAGIC LOSS OF LIFE. AND AT. I GUESS THEY'RE TAKING A STEP BACK BIG PICTURE AND A DOCTOR ARE TONY TALKED ABOUT SOME OPPORTUNITIES- DO YOU THINK CALIFORNIA IS DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING AND REGULATING THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITIES. CLEARLY EVERY REGULATORY AGENCY CAN DO A BETTER JOB AT OVERSIGHT H- YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE STATE THAT TOPICS THAT WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR OFFICE ON IS REALLY GOT THE CERTIFICATION OF PROGRAMS AND HOW WE- NEED MORE THERE AND MAKE THAT A MORE MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THE QUALITY OF CARE IS PROVIDED. FOLLOWING UP ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS THE DOCTOR SEND BURKE TOLD ME MAKE THIS WALL LOOK WHAT IT WHAT IS QUALITY CARE HOW DO WE DEFINE THAT ENSURE THAT OUR PROGRAMS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND I GET SPECIFICALLY WHAT DO YOU THINK NEEDS TO BE CHANGED AND IMPROVED. AS WE AS I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING ONE OF IDEAS THAT I KNOW THAT WE'VE. CURRENTLY IT'S A VOLUNTARY REQUIREMENT PER STATUTE AND I KNOW WE'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATIONS ON MAKING THAT A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT FOR OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT QUALITY CARE IS PROVIDED AND STANDARDS ARE CLEAR IN STATUTE CLEARS ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS- AND THAT WE CAN APPLY THOSE STATEWIDE. AND I'M I'M CERTAINLY GRATEFUL THAT I YOU AND YOUR YOUR DEPUTIES AGREED THAT. AS SOME SORT OF MANDATORY LICENSURE OR CERTIFICATION IS NEEDED I KNOW IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT. HAS BEEN ONGOING SINCE I WAS WAS FIRST ELECTED THREE YEARS AGO AND- I THINK THAT. IT SAYS IT'S PRETTY SHOCKING I THINK TO MOST CALIFORNIANS WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT FIVE YOU KNOW YOU NEED A LICENSE TO FISH YOU NEED A LICENSE TO CUT SOMEBODY'S HAIR. BUT RIGHT NOW ANYONE ANYONE CAN OPEN A DRUG TREATMENT FACILITY AND OPERATED WITHOUT ANY SORT OF CERTIFICATION OR LICENSE I WHICH I THINK IS. IS SHOCKING AND- AT ISSUE THAT THAT WE URGENTLY NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS. AB AND ACTUALLY DOCTOR MARK BARTOLOMMEO AT YOU IT OUTLINES SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE YOU THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITY FOR. AS CALIFORNIA TO IMPROVE OVERSIGHT I'M ANY OTHER SPECIFICS THAT YOU YOU WOULD SHARE THAT YOU WOULD HIGHLIGHTED. AT THE FACT THAT WE NEED. TO FIVE. AT ADOPT EVIDENCE BASED MEASURES AND- INJURED QUALITY TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY HE SAID SHIFT FROM THIS LICENSE FOR FLORIDA Q. FIVE MEASURES OF QUALITY IS ARE THERE ANY OTHER DETAILS THAT THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE EITHER WITH ME OR I WITH DIRECTOR BASS. SHE'S ON THE LINE SHE GESTIONES FOR HOW WE CAN IMPROVE. OUR OVERSIGHT IN THIS AREA. ABSOLUTELY I THINK ONE OF THE ONE OF THE MAIN AREAS WOULD BE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM RIGHT RIGHT NOW THAT IF IT'S A MEDIC CAL RELATED TYPE OF THING WHERE. THEN THE REQUIRED TO ENGAGE IN THE SYSTEM BUT IF IT'S NOT AND THEN THEY'RE NOT AS WE HAVE NO WAY TO REALLY GET A SENSE THAT AND IF YOU'RE A PARENT OR A LOVED ONE IN YOUR- YOU KNOW LOOKING FOR A TREATMENT CENTER AND THEY SAY THAT THEY PROVIDE SOME SORT OF SERVICES. THERE'S NO STANDARDIZATION TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN IN PARTICULARLY FOR EXAMPLE IN THE USE OF MEDICATIONS- THAT'S IT THAT'S IT THAT'S A BIG ONE SO THERE ARE STILL FACILITIES OUT THERE THAT- THEY MAY HAVE THEIR OWN PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH TO STEW AT THE CHARACTER OF FOLKS WITH. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND- AND BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO TO THE SIR THE CERTIFICATION HOWEVER. THEY'RE STILL TAKING CARE OF THE SAME PEOPLE IN TERMS OF HUMAN BEINGS THAT DOESN'T CHANGE I MEAN THE PAYER IS JUST PAYER SYSTEM- AND SO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENCE THERE AND THEY YOU KNOW. IT IT'S HOW WE ALSO KNOW WHETHER SOMEBODY'S COMING IN AND- THEY'RE USING MEDICATIONS ARE NOT USING MEDICATIONS WHAT YOU CAN IMAGINE GOING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL AND IN ONE PROGRAM YOU WOULD JUST BE YOU KNOW MAYBE HANDED A BOOK AND ASKED TO JUST KIND OF GO THROUGH IT. WITH MEANT WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING THE TYPE OF ASSESSMENTS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE ARE LOOKING INTO YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY TO KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE EVEN APPROPRIATE TO BE THERE IF YOU HAVE CO MORBID CONDITIONS- AND THEN AND THEN ANOTHER GROUP WOOD BUT- RIGHT NOW ONLY BECAUSE OF A PAIR. SO THOSE KIND OF THINGS NEED TO BE ALIGNED FOR SURE- AND THERE NEEDS TO BE NOT JUST AN OPTION TO BE. TO BE. SOMEBODY THAT DOES PROVIDE CARE THAT'S IT THAT THAT IS EVIDENCE BASED- SO I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THAT IS ONE MAIN ONE AND THEN THE OTHER ASPECT IS THE TRANSPARENCY SO THAT. THE FOLKS THAT ARE ENGAGING IN SERVICES AT ANY ONE OFTHESE IT SHOULD BE SIMPLER. TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU'RE GETTING. SO THE IF EUROPE. YOU'RE SENDING YOUR CHILD. YOU THINK MIGHT HAVE A MEDICAL ISSUE MAYBE THEY HAD A SEIZURE IN THE PAST. AND YOU DON'T RUN THE RISK OF THEM GOING TO A PLACE. TO DETOX OR- EVEN JUST BEING THERE WITHOUT A DETOX. WITHOUT APPROPRIATE. APPROPRIATELY TRAINED INDIVIDUALS. AND ARE PEOPLE THAT CAN HANDLE SUCH THINGS. NOW BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE RUN INTO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS A LOT OF THE MOM AND DAD THAT ARE GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT HOW THAT. THEIR CHILD IS NO LONGER. IS OFTENTIMES BECAUSE OF THAT AS WELL AS EXPECTATIONS AROUND STOPPING WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE OR AGAINST. CLINICAL ADVICE WHICH HAPPENS AS WELL. IF PEOPLE. DON'T HAVE THEIR SYMPTOMS- IT TREATED IF THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR WITHDRAWAL AMELIORATED WELL THEN THEY GET UP AND GO. AND THAT AND THEN AND SO WITH THE EXPECTATION AROUND THAT WELL RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE. WE GET WE HAVEN'T. GATHERED THAT UP AND SAID YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS AN EXPECTATION THAT IF EVEN IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO LEAVE AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE IT IS STILL YOUR DUTY. TO TRY TO PROTECT AND THE SAFETY OF THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THE AND THEN THERE SHOULD BE SOME STEPS. OTHER OTHERWISE WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE LEAVE AND THEN THEY DIE. BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING OUT INTO AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT A QUICK FOR THE PROBABLY UNSTABLE HAPPY TO SEE DOCTORS AND BUT HOW MAY BRING UP THIS ISSUE TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A- PARENTS ARE YOU AS A CLIENT OF TRYING TO GET HELP A YEAR IF YOU GOOGLE THERE'S NO WAY TO FIND- GOOD QUALITY FACILITIES SO WE'RE GOING TO BE A LAUNCHING IN RESPONSE TO THAT CONCERN. THAT SHATTER PROOF THAT LIST PLATFORM WHICH HAS BEEN LAUNCHED IN FEDERAL STATE. AND THE PLATFORM WILL ALLOW YOU TO TAKE IN A ST VALIDATED SURVEY. SHOULD DETERMINE YOU NEED RESIDENTIAL CARE COMMITTEE SERVED AS AN OUTPATIENT AND YOU NEED. MEDICATIONS ADDICTION. AFFECT THE STANDARD OF CARE APPROPRIATE THIS ORDER. AND THEN ONLY ON THAT I'M NOT DISABILITY WOULD YOU FIND FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LICENSED AT THEIR RESIDENTIAL AND WITH QUALITY METRICS THAT ARE ON HAVE BEEN VALIDATED NATIONALLY SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED THAT IN THE FALL OF NEXT YEAR WILL BE LAUNCHING THIS PROGRAM TO SOLVE EXACTLY THIS PROBLEM OF TRANSPARENCY. AND QUALITY STANDARDS WE ALSO WANTED TO BRING THAT BAD- WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED. AT EIGHT TWENTY THREE WHICH REQUIRES. FACILITIES TO ATTAIN A DESIGNATION BASED ON THE- SANTANDER'S CARE THE AYE LEVEL CARE DESIGNATION THAT DOCTORS HAD BEEN CALLING THE INVENTION SO WE SEE THAT. AND MANDATORY CERTIFICATION AS HER THREE- STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS. THEIR CONCERNS OF THEM BROUGHT UP TODAY ALONG WITH AGGRESSIVE INVESTIGATION WHEN WE SEE THEIR. ANSWERS FROM OUR OUR STANDARDS I'M AND I DO HAVE I HAVE A FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS RELATED TO. THE GRATITUDE LARGE INVESTIGATION BUT I'M GOING TO SAVE THOSE FOR OUR SECOND PANEL WHICH IS ABOUT RESPONDING TO PATIENT SAFETY INCIDENTS. I DO WANT TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS RELATED TO. OUR SPENDING IN THIS AREA SO- I EITHER FOR YOU OR FOR DIRECT BOSS. HOW MUCH DOES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPEND ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT SERVICES TODAY. ONE SECOND PLEASE I HAVE THE NUMBER. THE DRUG MEDIC HELP PROGRAMS THAT THIS IS JUST IN AND THE MEDICAL PROGRAM BUT IT IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. EXCUSE ME ABOUT. ABOUT BY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE IN THE DRUG MEDICAL PROGRAM SO UP FOR MEDICARE RECIPIENTS. TWO SIX AND A MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S FOR MEDICARE RECIPIENTS ONLY AND- HOW DOES DH CS TRACK THE EFFICACY OF THIS SPENDING. WE TRACK UTILIZATION WE TRACK- METRICS FOR OUTCOMES I WOULD TURN IT OVER TO IT DR PFEIFFER OR AND- YOU KNOW AROUND D. YEMEN ABOUT 95% OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE IN COUNTY THAT ARE INVOLVED- WE CALL THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE WERE THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO ROLL THIS PROGRAM OUT TO ALLOW THE FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT- WITH ALL THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS RUN NETWORK ADEQUACY AND QUALITY AND WEHAVE REQUIRED METRICS THAT ARE- FOLLOWED IN THE OUR DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM EVALUATION WHICH IS REPORTED TO CMS EVERY. YEAR AND IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE. SO WE DO YOU TRACK AND OUTCOMES AND UNDERSTAND. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS RECEIVE TREATMENT THAT IS EFFECTIVE VERSES. NOT EFFECTIVE. WE DO I WILL ADMIT THAT THE- DATA THAT WE COLLECTED THEM PERFECT SAYS YOU GO ON TO OUR VALUATION- WEBSITE THE DATA IS NOT AS ROBUST AS I THINK ANY OF US IN THIS ROOM WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONTINUALLY WORKING TO IMPROVE BECAUSE UTILIZATION MEANS WHO'S GETTING SERVICES AND THAT'S JUST THE STARTING POINT WE WANT TO SEE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING BETTER AND WE WANT TO SEE THAT THAT WE ARE AVOIDING OVERDOSE DEATHS AND WE WANT TO SEE IF WE'RE TREATING PEOPLE OF EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS AND- AND THAT IN ALL OF THAT THE APRIL HEALTH FIELD IS. NOT WHERE WE WANT TO BE AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK AND IMPROVE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ROBUST QUALITY METRICS THAT ARE TRANSPARENT FOR ALL. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON. CAN YOU AT. BUT WHEN YOU SAY ACTIVELY WORKING ON CAN YOU. GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE DETAIL IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT WE CAN EXPECT RELATED TO THAT IN THAT THE COMING YEAR. THANK YOU WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE PUBLISHING EASY T READ DASHBOARD SO THAT WE HAVE STANDARDIZED METRICS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND ISSUE THE AND THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND SO WE- HAVE METRICS PUBLISHED FROM MENTAL HEALTH AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS WELL AND RAINING TO PUBLISH THAT IN THE NEW YEAR. OKAY BUT WE WILL AT LEAST FOUR TRIBUNE NOT WHEN THAT IS. AVAILABLE AND AT AGAIN BEFORE WE WRAP UP THIS PANEL I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AT DIRECTOR BUS. RELATED TO IF YOU POINTS THAT YOU. MADE I'M SO SEVERAL TIMES YOU NOTED THAT. I THAT THESE. WHAT ARE THESE READ THESE RESIDENTIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES THESE LESS THAN SIX BY FIVE RECOVERY RESIDENCES ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDING TREATMENT SERVICES BOB WE HAVE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES BOTH IN MY DISTRICT AS WELL AS OTHER COMMUNITIES WHERE THESE RECOVERY RESIDENCES ARE PROVIDING TREATMENT SERVICES SO FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF DANA POINT HAS SINCE SUED MANY RECOVERY RESIDENTS OPERATORS AND DETERMINED THAT THEY ARE OPERATING WITHOUT A LICENSE. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THIS HAPPENS. BAKER CHARLIE JUST DISTRICT START BY SAYING WHEN WE HEAR OF THIS WE GO IN AND WE DO AN INVESTIGATION TO SEE IF INDEED THAT. LICENSE OF ALL SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED- AND IF THEY ARE THEN WE- ASSEMBLY. THIS EFFORT ON OUR- I TALK IF I FORGET MARCH OUT ON THAT. COMPLAIN WITHIN OUR AUTHORITY ENSURE THE NOT PRO SO THAT SHOULD BE LICENSED WE INVESTIGATE WHEN THEY DO AND WHEN THEY- AND WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COMPLY. AND I THINK THAT THE ISSUE FROM. MY VANTAGE POINT SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE'S NO TEETH ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO. THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD IF YOU SEND SOMEONE A LETTER SAYING PLEASECEASE AND DESIST BUT IF THE VERY NEXT WEEK. THAT THEY'RE STILL DOING THE SAME THING IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO CONSEQUENCES. WHICH IS WHY THIS IS JUST CYCLE OF DYSFUNCTION IS NOT STOPPED. WHEN AT WHAT POINT YOU ACTUALLY GO IN. AND SAY ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO DO MORE THAN SEND YOU A LETTER. WE ARE GOING TO SHUT YOU DOWN. HELLO THIS IS JANELLE AND I AM- WITH THE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION DIVISION SO WE DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY WITHIN OUR STATUTES REGULATIONS TO ISSUE DOUBLE DOSE OF OPERATIONAL VIOLATION OF LAW LETTER THEY ARE- REQUIRED TO SEIZE THE SERVICES WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS AND THAT THEY DO NOT CONCLUDE THEIR SERVICES ARE STOP WRITING SERVICE AND- BEGINNING ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY I TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR DAY CIVIL PENALTY DOES BEGIN PROGRAM. AND SO THAT IS ISSUED AGAINST THE- THE FACILITY SO WE WORK WITH THEM TO ENSURE THEY HAVE STOCKED AND IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROVE TO US THAT THEY STOP AND WE DO HAVE THE- AUTHORITY THEN TO GO IN AND SEES- OR SEEK AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE FACILITY WE WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. TO GET FOR ORDERS AND- IF NEEDED- INSPECTION WARRANTS- EXETER SO ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES THAT IF IT AGAIN IS DETERMINED THAT THEY ARE NOT CEASING THE SERVICES THAT WE CAN GO IN AND I'M. SEEK INJUNCTIONS AGAINST THE FACILITY. AND HOW OFF IS THAT. LIKE THIS PAST YEAR HOW OFTEN DID YOU ACTUALLY. ONE OF THESE ROGUE WHAT I WOULD CALL ROGUE REHAB FACILITIES OUT OF BUSINESS. SO WE HAVE NOT HAD TO SEEK- AN INJUNCTION AGAINST A FACILITY IN THIS PAST YEAR. YOU HAVE NOT HAD TO ARE YOU CHOSE NOT TO. WE HAVE NOT HAD TO WE HAVE NOT FOUND ANY EVIDENCE THAT- AND FACILITY THAT WE HAVE. ISSUED A CEASE AND DESIST CONTINUE TO OPERATE BEYOND- THAT FIFTEEN DAYS. AGAIN IF THERE IS OTHER EVIDENCE OUT THERE AND WE'RE ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE OKAY LET ME FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON. ON THAT. ABSOLUTELY ANY M. INFORMATION HOW WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE. AND AT DRUCKER BUS AGAIN BEFORE WE MOVE ON FROM THIS AT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO. DO YOU THINK THE DH CS THIS IS I GUESS TAKING A BIG STEP BACK. DO YOU THINK THE DH CS IS THE APPROPRIATE ENTITY AND STATE GOVERNMENT. TO ISSUE LICENSES AND TO MONITOR THESE FACILITIES OR IS THIS FUNCTION BETTER SITUATED WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH SINCE THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE FOR. WHAT WE MADE AT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES MAINTAINS OVERSIGHT OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROGRAMS AND SO WE HAVE OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF. A MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT AND SERVICES IN RECOVERING KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THE CONTINUUM OF THE SERVICES AVAILABLE AND OUR MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO WE MAINTAIN EACH YES IS THE APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO- EMBARK ON THESE DUTIES. AND AT LAST WE BEFORE WE TURN TO THAT THE SECOND PANEL WHICH WILL FOCUS ON. A PATIENT SAFETY INCIDENTS AND RESPONSES I DO WANT. TO ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO. THE LOCATION OF THESE FACILITIES AT. THESE MANY OF THESE FACILITIES INCLUDING LICENSED. DETOX FACILITIES ARE HOUSED IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS NOW IF I WANT TO OPEN A DIALYSIS CLINIC IN CALIFORNIA CAN I DO THAT TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES CAN I DO THAT IN MY HOME. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF A DIALYSIS CLINIC AND WHAT WHAT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW WHERE THE LOCATION OF A DIALYSIS CLINIC MAY BE LOCATED BUT A CORNER I KEEP AWARE OF OUR KIND OF OUR RECOVERY MODEL IS THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO A LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY GREAT SUPPORTS IN THE COMMUNITY WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THIS IS A BETTER PATH TOWARDS RECOVERY AND SO. I'M WITH THAT IN MIND THIS IS HOW ARE OUR LICENSING STRUCTURE IS- IS- OUTLINED. SO YOU SAID IT'S A KEY PILLAR OF YOUR RECOVERY MODEL AND WE KNOW THIS IS. THE BETTER MODEL HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS IS THE BETTER MODEL. AT ALL TO MY UNDERSTANDING FOR MY PART PRE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRACKING OUTCOMES. THE JUST THE GENERAL PREMISE OF THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IN HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES IS THAT THIS IS A CONTINUE- I'VE SERVICES AN INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE TREATED AND- I CARED FOR AND THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CARE NEEDED AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT INDIVIDUALS. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO SUCCEED AND THRIVE NEED TO BE PART OF THEIR COMMUNITY- AND SO THIS IS KIND OF PART OF THE CONTINUUM AS WE THINK THROUGH THE DIFFERENT SERVICES AVAILABLE- I'M- ON THE PATH TO RECOVERY. AND I CERTAINLY CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN IT'S- SIMPLY RECOVERY RESIDENTS IN SUPPORT BATES. A LICENSED TO DETOX FACILITY FACILITY IS PROVIDING MEDICAL SERVICES. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO BE DOING OUT OF MY HOME. WE HAVE MANY PROGRAMS IN THE MEDICAL SPACE WERE AT MEDICAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO THIS IS SIMILAR IN THE IN A SIMILAR VEIN WHERE MEDICAL AND HEALTH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN THE COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN RECEIVE- SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IN THE LOWEST LEVEL OF. INTERVENTION THAT IS NECESSARY. RIGHT YEAH. I'M LET'S SEE AND THEN LASTLY. LET ME JUST ASK YOU ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A COUPLE OF. PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED IN RECENT YEARS SO. ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB NINE NINETY TWO INTO LAW AND THIS REQUIRES THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CERTIFIED BY DH CS DISCLOSURE MENTORSHIP OR CONTROL OF ANY FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A RECOVERY AT RESIDENTS- THAT WAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAS THIS PROVISION BEEN IMPLEMENTED. SB NINE NINETY WAS IMPLEMENTED VIA AN INFORMATION NOTICE ON JANUARY TWENTY NINTH TWENTY NINETEEN- AND THIS IS INSURANCE WITH ALL THESE DISCLOSE OWNERSHIP RELATIONSHIPS AND- INSURED CLIENTS ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR TAKING MEDICATIONS OR KICKED IN ADDICTION OUR- TREATMENT. SO THIS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. YES OKAY AND I. ANOTHER PROVISION ENABLES AT DH CS TO DENY LICENSURE TO ENTITIES UNDER A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE LICENSEE HAS ENGAGED AVERAGE DEVOTEES AS DH CS IMPLEMENTED THIS PROVISION AND HAVE ANY LICENSES BEEN DNIED OR SUSPENDED AS A RESULT OF THIS PROVISION OF S. B. NINE NINETY TWO. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND ON OUR BEHALF. SO LIKE DIRECTOR BUST HAS MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THAT BILL AND TO DATE WE DON'T HAVE ANY THAT ARE RELATED TO THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE HAVE AND CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTION I'M AGAINST ANY FACILITIES BUT IN RELATION TO THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY THERE HAS BEEN- I THINK THAT WE'VE HAD- RELATED TO IT. BUT WHEN THEY AUTHORITY IS THERE AND- ANYTIME THERE IS ANY ACTION THAT COMES UP WE DEFINITELY WILL RELY UPON OUR AUTHORITY WITHIN THAT BILL TO USE IT IF NEEDED. AN EIGHTY NINE NINETEEN WHICH I AUTHORED I WAS STRUCTURED ON OCTOBER TWELFTH TWENTY NINETEEN. I SAID JUST OVER TWO YEARS AGO. SO CHIU QUESTIONS RELATED TO THIS BILLS IMPLEMENTATION SAID THIS BILL REQUIRED THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. PLEASE CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM AND HOW IT'S BEEN STAFFED. AND SECONDLY CAN YOU. PLEASE REPLY TO HOW MANY OF THE LICENSE FACILITIES HAVE PRODUCED THE CONTRACTS THAT WAS REQUIRED BY THIS LEGISLATION. BE SURE SO WE- HAS STEPPED UP AND ADDED SOME ANALYSTS TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM AND WE ARE NOW CURRENTLY IN OUR REVIEWS WHEN WORKING- WITH OUR LICENSED FACILITIES REQUIRING THAT THEY SUBMIT ALL THE REQUIRED INFORMATION IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE BILL- WE WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE DATA- I DON'T HAVE THAT. AT MY FINGERTIPS TO DATE- BUT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS BILL WE ARE ENFORCING IT AND WE HAVE ADDED ANALYSTS TO- OVERSEE THE SPARK PLUG. AND ACTUALLY AT RELATED. TO YOUR- ENFORCEMENT. PERSONNEL BOTH. THE ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE HIRED AS A RESULT OF AB NINE NINETEEN AND ALSO MORE BROADLY. OUT WHERE ARE YOUR INSPECTORS LOCATED. OVERSTOCKED WAREHOUSES- AT IN SACRAMENTO. I HAVE AND WHERE WHERE ARE THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITIES LOCATED. WE DO HAVE MAJORITY OF OUR FACILITIES- LICENSED AND CERTIFIED- WITHIN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION BUT WE DO COVER AGAINST STATEWIDE- WE HAVE FACILITIES THAT GO ALL THE WAY UP TO THE NORTHERN BORDERS OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING UP TO THE EASTERN BORDERS SO WE DO- MONITOR AND OVERSEE FACILITIES STATEWIDE. AND BUT GIVEN THAT THE FIVE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF THESE FACILITIES IS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- WHY DO WE HAVE ENFORCEMENT STAFF ONLY BASED IN SACRAMENTO. IT IS CURRENTLY WHERE OUR- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND C. D.'S- DIVISION IS LOCATED AND OUR STAFF ARE READY TO GO AND- ARE ABLE TO TRAVEL- WHEN NEEDED SO WE DO SEND OUT STAFF REGULARLY AND THEY TRAVEL TO ANY FACILITY- REGARDLESS OF THE LOCATION SO WE CAN SEND FOLKS. OUT IN CALIFORNIA THE GRANT VALUABLE WITHIN AN HOUR PLANE FLIGHT SO WE DEPLOYED ALL OF OUR STAFF- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I'M NOT FAMILIAR IS NOT AT. SACRAMENTO CENTRIC MODEL CONSISTENT WITH THE INVESTIGATORS AND THE WAY THAT YOU STAFF OTHER FUNCTIONS OF DH CS DO YOU HAVE ANY REGIONAL PRESENCE FOR OTHER DH CS DEPARTMENTS OR UNITS. YES I BELIEVE SO I'M SHE WENT INTO THIS ROLE BUT I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE OTHER REGIONAL OFFICES- FOR DIFFERENT OTHER FUNCTIONS IN IN THE DEPARTMENT. SUIT AT IT STRIKES ME THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM A REGIONAL PRESENCE AND FROM SOME RESOURCES BEING HOUSED IN THE REGION WHERE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY TASKED WITH MONITORING AND INSPECTING I'M WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. PROPOSAL. I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD WANT TO DISCUSS AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE SCOPE AND THE BREADTH OF HOW THAT WOULD WORK- IN PART OF THIS IS ALL IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE PROCESS AND SO I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. APPLE I'LL CERTAINLY PUT THAT ON OUR PART LIST TO FOLLOW UP THAT YOU KNOW AS YOU SAID YOU RECENTLY JOINED THE DEPARTMENT AND YOU'VE BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN THIS TOPIC AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AS I HAVE SHARED WITH YOU. THERE WAS A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL THAT IN FACT ACTUALLY PUT EVEN PROCEEDED MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE WHICH WOULD HAVE LOCATED INVESTIGATORS COST TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND- I'M ONE THAT PROPOSAL ENJOYED BROAD. REGIONAL SUPPORT AND FORTUNATELY THAT PROPOSAL WAS BLOCKED BY ONE OF YOUR PREDECESSORS SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN AB PURSUE THAT-% IN A MORE COLLABORATIVE FASHION AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER QUESTIONS BUT I REALIZE THE WORD IN OUR AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO IS. OPEN IT UP FOR IS CLOSE THIS PORTION OF THE HEARING- I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN DR BARTONE A FOR JOINING US I THINK YOU I'M DIRECTOR BASS AND I KNEW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ALSO BE PART OF OUR OUR DISCUSSION IN OUR SECOND PANEL. WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND AB WELL TIMED OUR SECOND PANEL YOU SEE WE'VE GOT AT WE ARE. AT B. JOINED ON OUR SECOND PANEL BY ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR KATRINA FOLEY. AND BY TODD FRANSON WHO IS AN INVESTIGATOR WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. MISTER FRANSON AND SUPERVISOR FULLY WILL DISCUSS THEIR EXPERIENCES RESPONDING TO PATIENT SAFETY INCIDENTS. RELATED TO RECOVERY TREATMENT FACILITIES AND THEN WE WILL. AS I SAID BE ASKING DOCTOR BASS TO RE JOIN US TO DISCUSS HOW THAT IT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE TO THESE INCIDENTS- WITH THAT GO AHEAD AND- WE WILL WELCOME AND- ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR KATRINA FOLEY THANK YOU SUPERVISOR FULLY FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU SIR ONE AND TEACHING. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES CAN. OKAY EXCELLENT WE HAD A FEW TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THAT ARE AMAZING STAFF TO CARE THANK YOU FOR YOUR STAFF THE DISTANCE- THANK YOU FOR CALLING THIS HEARING TODAY AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON GOING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE I DON'T THINK DIRECTOR MATTHEW- IS NEW TO THE JOB AND TO EVERYONE OUT TO TESTIFYING HERE TODAY. THESE ARE VERY CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WE HEAR AN ORANGE COUNTY HAVE BEEN- CACKLING FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AS YOU HEARD MY NAME IS KATRINA FOLEY I'M YOUR ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AT THE COSTA MESA CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND MAYOR I'VE ADVOCATED FOR REGULATORY REFORMS TO PROTECT PATIENTS FROM ABUSIVE PROFIT MAIL STYLE DETOX AND SOBER LIVING HOME OPERATORS. THANK YOU MORE HARM TO PATIENTS THAN THEY HELP. THE TYPES OF REGULATORY REFORMS THAT WE HAVE ADVOCATED FOR SIX TO PREVENT TRAGEDIES LIKE THE DEATH OF A TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD. MR LEHRER FROM HAPPENING. ALL OF US I THINK IT'S VERY IN. BECAUSE WE'VE DONE WANT BE HEADING OUT BURKE AT THE- ALL OF THAT. HAVE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS WHO STRUGGLE WITH ADDICTION IT'S SO COMMON IN AMERICA AND IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT IT'S HARD TO KNOW SOMEONE WHO HASN'T HAD A FAMILY MEMBER. WHO HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THAT SYSTEM. THIS IS AN ISSUE WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO STATE SPACE. AND MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE TREATMENT I THINK THAT'S THE KEY MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE ESPECIALLY GIVEN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND- RESPONSES THAT WE HEARD HERE ALREADY. I BELIEVE THAT CONTRARY TO STATEMENTS BY DIRECTOR BACK SOBER LIVING HOMES ARE REGULATED IN SOME CITY. THE CITY OF CUSTOM MADE AS AN EXAM AND THE COUNTY ORANGE. AB REGULATORY ORDINANCES THAT REGULATE- SOBER LIVING HOME TO BE LEGAL IN SEPTEMBER THE NINTH CIRCUIT UPHELD A JURY VERDICT THAT THE ORDINANCE FOR COSTA MESA WAS NON DISCRIMINATORY LATER THE COUNTY OF ORANGE I THOUGHT DID A SIMILAR ORDINANCE. THE PROVISIONS OF THE ORDINANCE REQUIRE COMMONSENSE PRACTICES INCLUDING DISPENSING REQUIREMENTS BETWEEN FACILITIES TWENTY FOUR HOUR SUPERVISION AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT OPERATORS TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO A SHELTER OR BACK HOME AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THOSE IN RECOVERY REQUIRE A TRANSPORT AND NOTIFICATION IF PEOPLE ARE TO LEAVE IS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM WANDERING AROUND AND POSSIBLY GOING INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S PRIVATE RESIDENTS IT. IT'S ALSO TO PROTECT THEM FROM BECOMING HOMELESS. ONE I'M LICENSED FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS THE CITY HAS FILED NUISANCE ABATEMENT CLAIMS TO SHUT DOWN UNSCRUPULOUS OPERATORS ENFORCEMENT AS IS KEEN AND IT'S WORKING. SO MY QUESTION IS WHY CAN'T THE H. P. S. SUPPORT SIMILAR STATEWIDE REGULATIONS. MOSTLY HOME HAVE BEEN CONVERTED HOSPITAL STYLE- NURSING STATION AND CAUGHT FOR DETOX SERVICES THEY'RE NOT LIKE REGULAR RESIDENTS AND THEY DON'T INTERACT WITH THE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD AS YOU ARE I MIGHT RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS THE RESIDENTS DON'T FOR EXAMPLE PARTICIPATING NEIGHBORHOOD GET TOGETHER HOLIDAY PARTIES PICNIC AT THAT TRACK THEY'RE REALLY THERE FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THERE'S BEEN ONGOING ROTATION IN AND OUT RARELY LEAVING THE SITE EXCEPT TO GO TO ORGANIZED ACTIVITIES. AFTER THE TRAGIC DEATH OF MR LEHRER I SENT A LETTER TO DIRECTOR BACK RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT GRATITUDE LARGEST STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REGULATIONS TO ENSURE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THOSE IN THE TOP. I APPRECIATED HER RESPONSE TO MY LETTER BUT IT FAILED TO ADDRESS THE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT IRATE MOREOVER THE PUBLIC RECORD REQUESTS THAT WE RECEIVED INCLUDING THE BIENNIAL LICENSE REPORT AND A DEATH INVESTIGATION REPORT RAISED MORE DOUBTS ABOUT THE OPERATION LIKE TO GRATITUDE LARGE DETOX AND THEIR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS AND TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS. IN DETOX AND RECOVERY YOU SHOULD THE SUBSTANTIAL NEGLIGENT DEMONSTRATED BY THIS FACILITY THE LACK OF MEANINGFUL ENFORCEMENT OF STATE REGULATION IS UNACCEPTABLE. I THE FACT RECORDS REQUESTS WILL REVEAL SIMILAR LACK ENFORCEMENT IN OTHER STATE LICENSED FACILITY. AND THOSE FACILITIES ARE PREDOMINANTLY LOCATED IN ORANGE COUNTY. AS AN EXAMPLE ACCORDING TO THE BIENNIAL LICENSE REPORT GRATITUDE LARGE WAS CITED FOR EIGHT DEFICIENCY. WELL THE DATE OF THE REVIEW IS REDACTED THE REPORT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED ON AUGUST NINETEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S SEVEN DAYS PRIOR TO THE DEATH OF MR LEHRER. VIOLATIONS INDICATE THE NEGLIGENT CONDUCT PRACTICE BY THIS PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL FILES ADMISSION AGREEMENT AND RESIDENTS HELP GREENING. THE FACILITY WAS ALSO DEFICIENT IN COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LICENSE FEES SO DEVELOP MAINTAIN AND IMPLEMENT AN ONGOINGTRAINING PROGRAM FOR ALL STAFF. ADEQUATE TRAINING IS FUNDAMENTAL TO END UP TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THOSE IN DETOX. SURE PROVISION OF PATIENTS AND DETOX ALSO IS FUNDAMENTAL STAFF SHOULD HAVE THE COMPETENCY TO DEAL WITH DIFFICULT SITUATIONS INCLUDING NEGATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS. AND EFFECT OF MEDICAL DRUGS THAT PATIENTS EXPERIENCE WHILE IN DETOX. THIS IS WHY IN ORANGE COUNTY WE ARE OPENING TO BE WELL FACILITIES THAT HAVE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT DETOX ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND ARE IN A MEDICALLY- SUPERVISE ENVIRONMENT NOT NEIGHBORHOODS. IF THE STAFF MEMBER RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE SURVEYOR HAD THE PROPER TRAINING IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD BETTER THAN BETTER EQUIPPED TO RESPOND TO HIS REPORTED HALLUCINATION AND ACTION ON THIS TRAGIC NIGHT. ONGOING TRAINING AND ONGOING TRAINING PROGRAM AND STAFF THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THAT NECESSARY TRAINING ARE CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO SUPERVISE PATIENTS IN DETOX PROPERLY. WE REQUEST THAT THE DEPARTMENT ENFORCE THE EXISTING RULES THAT RELATE TO TRAINING AT THE VERY. WHY DOESN'T THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRE PROFESSIONAL LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION OF TRAINING FOR STAFF STANDARDIZATION IS NEEDED COMPLY WITH EVEN THE MOST BASIC REQUIREMENT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF MEANINGFUL ENFORCEMENT. BY THE DEPARTMENT. I'M ASKING THAT THE AGENCY HAD PROVIDE OUR OFFICE WITH WRITTEN EVIDENCE AND ALSO TO THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE DEATH INVESTIGATION REPORT IS PREDOMINANTLY REDACTED IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT STEPS WERE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THIS INCIDENT. WE'VE REQUESTED THAT WE DID PROVIDED WITH AN UNREDACTED VERSION OF THIS FULL REPORT IMMEDIATELY. THIS WEEK I ALSO BECAME AWARE OF A MARCH TWENTY TWENTY INVESTIGATIVE REPORT CONCERNING ALLEGATIONS ABOUT TWO OTHER LICENSED FACILITIES ON DAHLIA STREET IN NEWPORT BEACH. THIS IS SENSITIVE ALLEGATIONS RAISED BY AN INVESTIGATOR INDIANS YEAH ARE TROUBLING ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT MANY OF THESE DEFICIENCIES WERE IDENTIFIED IN PREVIOUS. BI ANNUAL REVIEW. BUT TWENTY TWENTY RECORD RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS IN BOTH FACILITY. IN ADDITION I'M CONCERNED THAT THESE TWO FACILITIES HAVE REPEATEDLY FAILED TO MAKE TIMELY CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE DEFICIENCIES AND NOTHING REALLY GETS DONE. I SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE REGULATIONS CONCERNING LICENSE ALCOHOL AND DRUG TREATMENT FACILITY. I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE'S A PATTERN IN WHICH IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES ARE NOT BEING MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS. THE CURRENT REGULATORY APPROACH IS NOT WORKING I HOPE THAT YOU H. C. S. WHAT DENNIS BY IMPROVEMENTS TO INTERNAL DH CS PROCEDURE THAT WILL PROVIDE FEATHER REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF WHITES AND DRUG AND ALCOHOL FACILITY. I HOPE YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO US WHAT THOSE INTERNAL PROCEDURAL CHANGES WILL BE. IT SHOULD NOT TAKE A TRAGEDY AND A DEATH OF A YOUNG MAN. A TRAGEDY INVOLVING ANOTHER FAMILY THAT LIVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO HAVE INVESTIGATORS FROM THE HDS INSPECTED SILVA DATE. MORE THAN ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS. I KNOW THAT THE CHAIRWOMAN MENTIONED DEPRIVE YOUR BILL WELL THAT BILL WAS SOMETHING THAT I HELPED ASSEMBLYWOMAN SHARON QUIRK SILVA TRIED TO PURSUE AT THE STATE LEVEL MANY YEARS AGO. WHERE WE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THE CITY OF COSTA MESA AT THAT TIME HAD AGREED TO PAY FOR INSPECTORS TO THE HOUSE IN ORANGE COUNTY SO THAT THEY COULD ADDRESS THE MANY INSPECTIONS NEEDED HERE LOCALLY AND INDUSTRIES. OPPOSED THAT BILL AND IT DID NOT PASS. IT'S TIME FOR THIS COMMONSENSE PROPOSAL TO BE RECONSIDERED AND THIS TIME IS FUNDED BY THE STATE SERVICES NEEDS A PARADIGM SHIFT THAT PROVIDE BETTER ENFORCEMENT COULD PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS AND RECOVERY THE STAFF PUT AN ACCEPTABLE PUTS PATIENTS IN DETOX THAT RAN. THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS NEIGHBORHOODS I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR TESTIMONY AND TO ASK QUESTIONS AND FOR CARING ABOUT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU A SUPERVISOR FULLY. AND ACTUALLY BEFORE WE TURN TO- HERE FROM INSPECTOR FRIENDS AND- I WANT DIRECTOR BOSS I'D HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO. A NUMBER OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU RAISED IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS. AT AND I THINK. LET'S LET'S START FIVE DIRECTOR ABBAS WITH THE INVESTIGATION INTO GRATITUDE YOUR RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS THAT SUPERVISOR FULLY RAISED IN HER COMMENTS. I WILL START AND THEN I WILL ASK MY TEAM TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS AND SOME OF THE SPECIFICS ON THE- ON THE INVESTIGATIONS- SO TO BEGIN WITH. WE M. IN REGARD TO THE GRATITUDE BOTCH- INVESTIGATION IN THE EVENT THAT OCCURRED ON AUGUST TWENTY SIX TWENTY TWENTY ONE I AGAIN WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRAGIC LOSS OF A YOUNG LIFE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE AFFECTED BY THE EVENTS OF THE DAY I'M WE ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PEOPLE OBTAINING TREATMENT SERVICES AND RECOVERY RESIDENCES AND LICENSED TREATMENT FACILITIES ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OUR COMMUNITY FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT CHRONIC DISEASE OF ADDICTION AFFECTS PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE- NEED SAFE LIVING SPACES THAT THEY- PURSUE PATH TO RECOVERY AND WE SUPPORT AND BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WITH ADDICTION DESERVE TO LIVE IN RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES. AS THEY PURSUE THEIR PATH TO RECOVERY. AT THE SAME TIME WE HOLD OURSELVES RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING EVERY DEATH EARLY AND HOLDING FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR SAFE PRACTICES. GRATITUDE LODGE CURRENTLY HAS THREE SEPARATE LICENSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES CHIU AND NEWPORT BEACH AND ONE IN LONG BEACH. UP SO WE HAVE THAT. REDLANDS DR LOCATION- IN NEWPORT BEACH IN THIS WAS HAD ITS INITIAL LICENSE ON MAY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE GET A LICENSE ONLY NO CERTIFICATION- AND IT'S LICENSE FOR RESIDENTIAL CARE FOR ALL GENDERS AND DETOXIFICATION. THERE IS ANOTHER LOCATION ON CLIENT DRIVE IN NEWPORT BEACH IN THE INITIAL LICENSE WAS FEBRUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY AGAINST LICENSE ONLY AND NO CERTIFICATION. A LICENSE FOR RESIDENTIAL CARE FOR ALL GENDERS AND DETOXIFICATION AND THEN THE THIRD LOCATION IN LONG BEACH ADDITIONAL LICENSE IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AGAIN LICENSE ONLY AND NO CERTIFICATION AND OUT LICENSE FOR RESIDENTIAL CARE. FOR ALL TRACTORS AND DETOXIFICATION. IN THIS CASE IMAGE CREDIT TO WATCH DH CS THE DEATH VERIZON ON. AUGUST TWENTY SIX TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND A PHONE CALL WAS PLACED AT THE FACILITY ON AUGUST THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO OBTAIN MORE DETAILS REGARDING THE INCIDENT. THIS WAS PROPERLY INVESTIGATED AND AN UNANNOUNCED SITE VISIT OCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER EIGHTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE INVESTIGATION CONSISTED OF THE ACS STAFF REVIEWING CLIENT INTERVIEWING CLIENTS AND STAFF REVIEWING CLIENT FILES AND DOCUMENTATION REVIEWING CAMERA FOOTAGE REVIEWING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND REQUESTING THE POLICE AND CORONER'S REPORT. PRIOR TO CONDUCTING AN ONSITE DEATH INVESTIGATION GENERALLY DCF STAFF CONDUCT INTERNAL MEETINGS WITH MANAGEMENT TO DISCUSS THE PLAN FOR HOW THE INVESTIGATION WILL. BE CONDUCTED. THE PREPLANNING OF INVESTIGATION ASSISTING H. YES STAFF AND OBTAINING ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION AND INTERVIEWS. DEFICIENCIES WERE CITED AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION. FIRST DEFICIENCIES THE PROGRAM FAILED TO REFER THE CLIENT TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE REMEDIAL ACTION WAS PROGRAM HAS RETRAINED ALL STAFF AND UPDATED THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO INCLUDE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OR NINE ONE ONE WHEN A CLIENT IS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING SEVERE MEDICAL OR PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES. THIS DIVISIONS THAT THE PROGRAM DID NOT FOLLOW THEIR OWN POLICY PROCEDURE REGARDING DOCUMENTATION OF RESIDENT REFERRALS AND THE REMEDIAL ACTION WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE RESPONSIBLE CLINICIAN FAILED TO DOCUMENT THE REFERRAL CURRENT THE PROCEDURE. THE CLINICAL PROGRAM DIRECTOR COMPLETED IT M. PERSON TRAINING ON IT NOVEMBER ELEVEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON THE PROTOCOL FOR DOCUMENTING. A CLIENT REFERRALS THE FACILITY RESPONDED TO THESE DEFICIENCIES AND THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN X. ACCEPTED. IN ADDITION A ROUTINE BY ANIL LICENSING COMPLIANCE VISIT WAS CONDUCTED AT THAT LINE DRIVE LOCATION ON AUGUST TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. DEFICIENCIES WERE CITED IN THAT SENSE BEEN CLEARED BY DH YES WE WILL ALSO BE CONDUCTING CONDUCTING ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE REVIEWS AT BOTH LOCATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS IS A VERY TRAGIC AND UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT. AND DCS DID NOT FIND THAT THE PROGRAM WAS NEGLIGENT IN CARE OF THE CLIENT IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. D. H. U. S. LICENSE PROGRAMS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING MEDICAL CLEARANCES TO DETERMINE IF THE REPLACEMENT IS APPROPRIATE AND RELY ON A MEDICAL ASSESSMENT A CLEARANCE. BASED ON DOCUMENTATION REPUTED HITCH YES DID NOT FIND THAT THE PROGRAM WAS ACTING BEYOND THE AUTHORITY THAT WOULD WARRANT ASSIST SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF THEIR LICENSE. DGS WILL REVOKE OR SUSPEND THE LICENSE OF A PROGRAM WHEN IT'S BEEN DETERMINED TO LEGALLY JUSTIFY SUCH AN ACTION. DCS ISSUE THE FACILITY A CLASS A DEFICIENCY ABOUT THERE IS DEFICIENCY LEVEL AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE APPROVED AND THE COMPLAINT WAS CLOSE. NO SUSPENSIONS ARE REVOCATIONS HAVE BEEN ISSUED AGAINST THE PROGRAM WE UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION WITH THE REDACTED REPORT HOWEVER FEDERAL HIPPA PRIVACY LAWS AND FEDERAL REGULAR REGULATIONS PREVENT THE RELEASE AS MANY DETAILS. AND I WILL SAY THAT WE SHARE- SOME OF THE SUPERVISOR'S COMMENTS IN TERMS OF REALLY CREATING A STANDARDIZATION AND THE NEED FOR MANDATORY CERTIFICATION OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE ALL HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STANDARDS OF THESE PROGRAMS. I THINK I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE TEAM FOR ANY SPECIFICS THAT I MISSED IN REGARD TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS. WELL AND ACTUALLY I GUESS BEFORE YOUR YOUR TEAM COMMENTS. THAT PERHAPS THEY CAN DO. SO IN THE CONTEXT OF I THINK MY FEEDBACK ON THIS ISSUE. SO BASED ON THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE SHARED WITH US THIS FACILITY WAS CITED FOR EIGHT DEFICIENCIES. MERE DAYS EIGHT DAYS PRIOR TO THE DEATH OF MISTER LATER. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID THEN YOU DID A AT SURPRISE VISIT ONE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OF THIS GENTLEMAN AND ADDITIONAL DEFICIENCIES WHERE SITE IT. YET EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU. APPEAR TO NOT EVEN BE GIVING THIS FACILITY A SLAP ON THE WRIST. AND NOTHING IS CHANGING NOTHING IS IMPROVING I THINK WE ALL EARNED AT A VERY EARLY AGE THAT CONSEQUENCES MATTER. CONSEQUENCES MATTER AND WHEN YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH THIS INDUSTRY WHERE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO CONSEQUENCES. FOR THEM NOT. LIVING UP TO STATE REGULATIONS THEM NOT LIVING UP TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. THEY THIS INDUSTRY IS LEARNING THAT THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL THEY WANT. AND YOU'LL SEE RIGHT THE MINUTE AS CITATION AND IT'S LIKE A FIX IT TICKET. AND GUESS WHAT AT SOME POINT. THE BLOOD OF THESE KIDS ARE DYING IN THESE FACILITIES IS NOT JUST ON THE HANDED THESE HORRIBLE OPERATORS IT'S ON YOUR HANDS AS WELL. AND SO I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT GOES BEYOND ISSUANCE OF A LIST A LONG LIST OF DEFICIENCIES. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE A THING ABOUT THE QUALITY RECEIVING. AND I WOULD ALSO I WOULD ALSO ARGUE. THAT YOUR EMPHASIS ON ASIANS DESERVING TO LIVE IN A RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY IN MY VIEW IS COMPLETELY MISSING THE FOREST FOR THE TREES I LIKE SO MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PART OF THIS HEARING LIKE SO MANY INDIVIDUALS ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE BATTLED THE DEMONS OF ADDICTION AND GUESS WHAT I THINK THEY DESERVE I THINK THEY DESERVE. HIGH QUALITY TREATMENT THEIR LIFE ON TRACK I DON'T CARE WHERE THAT HAPPENS I WANTED TO HAPPEN. AND I WOULD ALSO SUBMIT TO YOU THAT MR LAYERS PARENTS FEEL THE SAME WAY. I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU. THAT WENDY MCINTYRE THE MOTHER OF A BOY NAMED JARED SHE FEELS THE SAME WAY. SHE WANTS YOU TO PROTECT PATIENTS IN RECOVERY. NOT HIDE BEHIND SOME WEIRD SMOKESCREEN WHERE IT'S SOMEHOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THEY CAN LIVE IN A RESIDENTIAL HOME. SO IF YOU CAN PLEASE. AT EIGHT YOUR OF YOUR DEPUTIES CAN PLEASE RESPOND TO MY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS CONSTANT HAMSTER WHEEL OF DEFICIENCIES. RESPONSE AND ACCEPTANCE AND AT WHAT POINT DOES IT END LIKE WHAT TO SOMEBODY ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO. TO GET THEIR LICENSE REVOKED. BACK TO BACK I THINK YOU'RE ON MUTE. AND I'M SURE I WOULD LOVE TO RESPOND AND THEN I'LL HAND IT OFF TO CHEN ALLIED PURSE GRANT THREE YOUNG PEOPLE NOT IN MY LIFE BECAUSE OF- DEATH OF OVERDOSE I TAKE THAT VERY VERY SERIOUSLY I READ EVERY DESK RECORDED WORKS WITH THE TEAM TO HOLD THEM. AND OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THE RIGHT THING BY THE FACILITIES RESPECTFULLY IN THIS CASE STATE DEFICIENCIES THAT YOUR REFERENCE OR NOT ESTRATEGIAS LARGE THEY'RE IN A DIFFERENT SITE. OWNED BY THE SAME ORGANIZATION THEY WERE MOSTLY- PERSONNEL FILE ISSUES THAT THEY THAT WE ISSUED THE DEFICIENCIES AND ENSURE THAT THE FACILITY RENEGADE THEM AND THEN THEY WERE PROMPTLY. SEX SO- AND SERIOUSLY RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY HELLO DON'T SEE THESE WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO PREVENT SHARING THE CONCERN IT IS THAT IT IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY ANYTIME WE HEAR OF ANY TYPE OF LOSS OF LIFE THE DEPARTMENT TAKES A VERY SERIOUS AND- VERY POSSIBLY IF THERE'S ANY. I AM INTERNET LEGENDS THAT WE FIND WITH THEM OUR LICENSEE WE- WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR LEGAL TEAMS TO TAKE ACTION. I'M AGAINST ANY OF THOSE PROVIDERS SO AGAIN WE I THINK WE ALL SHARE. THE SAME CONCERN. I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- ACT SWIFTLY. AGAINST ANY PROVIDER THAT WE FEEL HAS- YOU KNOW ANY RESPONSIBILITY HERE AND SO AGAIN BUT I THINK WE ALL SHARE THE SAME CONCERN. AND I WOULD. MENTION SOMETHING THAT BEGAN WITH THAT BUT AGAIN WHY WERE SO- HAPPY ABOUT YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE OF MANDATING STANDARDS STATEWIDE STANDARDS AND WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EUROPE AND BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE THAT OUR- CERTIFICATION STANDARDS ARE EXPLAINED FOR EXAMPLE THEY- ARE VERY STRICT. ON THE REQUIREMENTS FOR TREATING OPIOID USE DISORDER WHICH MEDICATIONS WHICH IS THE STANDARD CARE AND THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF MANY OVERDOSE DEATHS AT THE LACK OF THESE MEDICATIONS SO. WE DO THINK THAT MANDATORY CERTIFICATION HOW. MUCH PROMISE IN TREATING THE KIND OF STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR QUALITY AND. SAFETY THAT WE ARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND BEFORE I WELCOME- MR FRANCE AND YOUR SPECIFIC RESPONSE IN A COUPLE OF THE OTHER POINTS THAT SUPERVISOR FULLY RAISED IN HER OPENING STATEMENT. AND BOTH A REQUEST TO ENFORCE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. AND AS- A BRIEF REQUIRED BY STATE LAW. AT AND THE SECOND FOR I WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF CORRECTIVE ACTION TO BE SENT TO HER OFFICE AS WELL AS TO THIS COMMITTEE. SO FIRST WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THAT TRAINING STANDARDS MUST ENFORCE AN UNIDENTIFIED DEFICIENCY WE WORK WITH THAT FACILITY TO REMEDY THAT QUICKLY- REGARDING THE OTHER ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE RECORD I DISCARDED YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF WHAT WERE ALLOWED TO DO IT AND I'M PROUD TO STANDARDS BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT SPEAK OF ALL. RIGHT SO. THE REPORTS- WE DO PROVIDE HELP PUBLIC B. THAT YOU HAVE TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL OF OUR HIT THE AND FORTY TWO CFR PART TO CONFIDENTIALITY LINES- PRIOR TO A REPORT BEING RELEASED IT DOES GO HROUGH OUR PRIVACY OFFICE AND LEGAL TEAMS. I'M TO MAKE SURE IT'S IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT SO THE DEPARTMENT IS BEHOLDEN TO BOTH AND NOT ONLY THE HIT THE CONFIDENTIALITY LAWS BUT THE FORTY TWO CFR. AND I WILL SAY THAT THE FORTY TWO CFR PARTS YOUR REQUIREMENTS ARE VERY STRICT WHICH IS WHY YOU WILL SEE A HIGH LEVEL OF REDUCTION IN OUR REPORT SO AGAIN- IT'S- THAT'S THE WAY WE HAVE TO RELEASE THEM AND- IT IS DONE. THROUGH OUR PRIVACY OFFICES. AND THEN LASTLY IN HER OPENING REMARKS IS REVISOR FULLY ASKED- WOOD D. DOES DH CS SUPPORT THE KINDS OF REFORMS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN THE CITY OF COSTA MESA. AS A MODEL A STATE A MODEL FOR AT. RAISING STANDARDS STATEWIDE. I IN TERMS OF- OVERSEEN- RESIDENTIAL US IT BUT LET ME HOMES THAT I THINK THAT IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF LIKE DCS- EMBARKED ON IS IT HEY IT'S UNRELATEDTO MEDICAL OR HEALTH THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL HEALTH SERVICES SO WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANOTHER STATE ENTITY THAT. ESSENTIALLY REGULATES BROMATE TYPE RELATIONSHIPS I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS BUT I- IT WE COULD BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS MORE WHAT THAT PARTICULAR CITY ORDINANCES ARE BUT MAKING GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT. IS OUR PERSPECTIVE OKAY AND PERHAPS WE SHOULD DO THAT ARE FINE BUT- IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. IT'S OUTSIDE OF YOUR- SCOPE SO FIVE VALUE. MAY NOT SUPPORT IT IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU OPPOSE. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE ORDINANCE IS DUE IT IN THEIR SPECIFICS WHERE WE REGULATE AND OVERSEE HEALTH PROGRAMS AND HEALTH STANDARDS AND TREATMENT SERVICES AND SO- IF THAT THAT ORDINANCES ARE BEYOND THAT I GUESS IT'S JUST ON OUR AREA OF EXPERTISE OKAY ALL RIGHT AND WE CAN FOLLOW UP OFFLINE. AT AND IT. WITH A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICITY AROUND THESE ORDINANCES DIVISOR FULLY DID SHARE SOME OF THAT IN HER OPENING REMARKS BUT- IT'S PROBABLYA BLANK HERE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE TIME FOR THAT RIGHT. RIGHT NOW. BOB SO WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND WELCOME HI TODD FRANSON WHO IS. AN INVESTIGATOR WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US MISTER FRANCIS. THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE A PREPARED STATEMENTS WE HAVE A COUPLE WILL CONSIDER JOTTED DOWN AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH THIS. INTRODUCTION OF MYSELF- I STARTED WITH THAT ANOTHER AGENCY WITH ORANGE COUNTY- I WORKED AS A- PATROL OFFICER AND DETECTIVE FOR A FEW YEARS AND JOIN THE ORANGE COUNTY IS OFFICE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO LAND AND OUR MEDICAL INSURANCE FRAUD UNIT. IN A FEW MONTHS LATER WELL AS A SIGN CHIU- WILL BECOME KNOWN AS THE SOBER LIVING INVESTIGATION PROSECUTION TEAM- FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN THROUGH BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR- I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK THAT HUNDREDS OF INTERVIEWS. WITH THEIR PATIENTS AND PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE ADDICTION TREATMENT- UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE ADDICTION TREATMENT CENTER WORLD- THE BULK OF TOSE BEING PATIENCE- NEXT CLASSIFICATION OF HIS BODY BROKERS- WHICH IS- EIGHTY. SUBSET WHICH IS BIG ON THIS WHICH IS WHAT'S FUELING THE BULK OF THE FRAUD IN THE INDUSTRY- I TALKED TO DISABILITY OWNERS I SPOKE WITH PSYCHIATRISTS COUNSELORS AND OTHER STAFF AT THESE FACILITIES. I SPOKE WITH DOCTORS AND SURGEONS- I'VE ALSO HAD- BOTH UNFORTUNATE AND FORTUNATE- CONVERSATIONS WITH- WHAT I WOULD CLASSIFY AS DOZENS OF PARENTS SIBLINGS AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR THEIR CHILDREN THEIR LOVED ONES- TO ADDICTION TREATMENT- AND ESPECIALLY PEOPLE THAT WERE HAVE BEEN STUCK IN A CYCLE- YEAH DIFFERENT TO ARENAS THAT. OUR IN THIS OUR ORDERS OVER LIVING HOMES WE JUST THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED- ADDICTION TREATMENT FACILITIES LABS SURGERY CENTERS AND THERE ARE SPECIALLY IT'S MONEY INSURANCE I'M GOOD FUELS ETCETERA. BUT CYCLE ABOUT INJECTION TREATMENT. IN MY OBSERVATIONS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS- IT'S BEEN LACK OF RESOURCES THE INVESTIGATIONS WE DO OUR SITE. FISSION SEE OF LAWS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A LACK OF A PUNISHMENT CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED. WITHOUT THAT TED- ENFORCEMENT ARM IT'S DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE A SERIOUS AND GET OUT OF. THE INDUSTRY. ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WE HAVE- SINCE I'VE BEEN WAS INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT. ADDICTION TREATMENT FACILITIES. AND CUSTOMER LIVINGHOMES I WOULD I WOULD SAY IS THE DIFFICULTY- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS AN INVESTIGATOR- IN CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS THE PEOPLE THEY'RE ALL. YES SOME OF THE PATIENTS. AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THESE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES- PROTECTION- SORRY AT SOBER LIVING HOMES ARE YOUNGER IMMATURE THERE FROM OUT OF STATE. WELCOME NUMBER A DECADE OPIATES. THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR FAMILY STRUCTURE WHEN PEOPLE COME IN FROM OUT OF STATE TO FALL BACK ON- MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE. HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF PRIOR CRIMES DON'T TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THEY'RE GETTING PAID TO GO THROUGH THIS AND ARE GETTING PAID TO RESET OF ICE TO RELAPSE AND STATE DEPARTMENT UNNECESSARY. STAND CYCLE. THANK YOU. AT THE END AT RETURNED LET ME JUST ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SO AS YOU HIGHLIGHTED A FRAUD AND ABUSE IN THIS INDUSTRY IS RAMPANT- I ACTUALLY WORKED ON A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THIS YEAR WITH OUR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER LARA I AND- THE RECOVERY FRAUD IS THE FASTEST GROWING FORM OF INSURANCE FRAUD IN. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME AS THE AT THE CHALLENGES- AND AT LACK OF RESOURCES AND INEFFICIENCIES IN STATE LAWS LACK OF PUNISHMENT AND CONSEQUENCES. IN YOUR VIEW I WHAT ARE SOME SPECIFIC. I STEPS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD TAKE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS WHAT WHAT I THINK IS A REAL CRISIS. I WHEN THAT I THINK. THIS IS NOT AN EASY SOLUTION WOULD BE A MORE SPECIFIC WALK- I CAN NAME BY TWO DIFFERENT LAWS- THAT WE DON'T HAVE HERE WITHIN OUR STATE RESOURCES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND I WOULD JUST BE THE STATUTES BUT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HAS AN ORDINANCE- IT IS THE ELIMINATING KICKBACKS IN RECOVERY ACT. ACCRA EIGHTEEN USC TWO TWO ZERO- AND ALSO SPECIFIC AT THE STATE OF FLORIDA ALSO HAS A PATIENT BROKERING LAW- BEARER THEIR STATUE NUMBER IS EIGHT ONE SEVEN POINT FIVE ZERO FIVE. ESSENTIALLY. EACH ONE OF THOSE DO IS. MAKE THE LONG SPECIFIC TO- FILING CHARGES. AGAINST DISABILITIES THERE KICKED AND ARE ALL MAPPED BOTH DIRECT WILL PAYING EVERY. EACH ONE OF THOSE ARE THE WAY THEY'RE WRITTEN ARE STREAMLINE- EIGHT THE PROBLEM- OF- AS OPPOSED TO THE STATE ORDINANCES WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WORKS WERE BROAD BASED- AND DEAD DIFFICULT TO BOTH PROSECUTE AND- I GATHER EVIDENCE ON. SO THAT'S THAT'S VERY HELPFUL SERVE I IT. JUST MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE PIECES OF LEGISLATION ONE AUTHORED BY FIVE. THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT THAT- THEN SENATOR NOW IT AT COMMISSIONER LARA I BELIEVE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEN I DID A FOLLOW UP PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS WILD RELATED TO TRYING TO CRACK DOWN ON KICKBACKS IN THIS INDUSTRY. IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE EITHER HAVE NOT GONE FAR ENOUGH OR- THERE'S ADDITIONAL SPECIFICITY NEEDED SO THAT YOU AND- OTHER INVESTIGATORSOTHER DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE BETTER TOOLS IN YOUR TOOLBOX FOR ENFORCEMENT. IS THAT YOUR SAY WE HAVEN'T GONE FAR ENOUGH HAVEN'T GOTTEN SPECIFIC ENOUGH CAN YOU TO SPEAK TO WHAT'S MISSING. BUT I WOULD SAY IS NOT SPECIFICITY- BECAUSE THAT IS TO STATUTES THAT I MENTIONED ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO PATIENT- KICKBACKS AND FACILITY KICK- IT'S SPECIFIC TO BODY BROKERING- WHICH IS IT SPECIFIC TERM IT DESCRIBES A SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE. I'M IN MY EYES- ARE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE WELCOME TO FRAUD AND THE DEATHS IN THIS INDUSTRY. YES AND I WOULD AGREE I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT I THINK. I AS WE HAVE SEEN AT EVERY PHASE AND CERTAINLY APPEARED CRISIS SADLY WE HAVE SEEN. PREDATORY ACTORS WHO HAVE- EXPLOITED THIS IS THE CRISIS WHETHER IT WAS. THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS TO BEGIN WITH THE AT YOUR DOCTORS TO OVER PRESCRIBE THIRD FOR NOW. BODY BROKERS AND THESE REAL GREAT HAD CENTER OPERATORS WHO I SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK OFF THE BACK OF PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY REALLY DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES- IT IS. HER AFFECT THAT COULD BE TAKEN AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT WOULD GIVE YOU AND FOLKS DOING SIMILAR WORK MORE TOOLS FOR CRACKING DOWN ON POT THAT THEIR FRAUDULENT AND BAD ACTORS IN THIS SPACE. I WAS A JUST A REPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AND THAT INVESTIGATORS. THAT COULD APPLY THEIR TIME- SPECIFICALLY- AS I MENTIONED I WORK FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY- THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CITIES WITHIN ORANGE COUNTY THAT OFTEN CASTIGATE HERS- AND IF WE COULD ALL WORK TOGETHER SHARE THE SAME INFORMATION. AND STREAMLINE SOME OF THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT MAKE UP A BIGGER TENT AND- THIS PROBLEM. AND I THINK YOUR YOUR COMMENTS. REALLY HIGHLIGHTING WHY THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO WRAP OUR HANDS AROUND THAT THE CHALLENGE OF EFFECTIVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT IS ENORMOUS. JUST IN AND OF ITSELF AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE AT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IT IN FACT INCENTIVIZING BAD BEHAVIORS AND SABOTAGING RECOVERY. AND I THINK EXPLOITING LOOPHOLES IN THE LAW TO AT. REALLY JUST BROKE PATIENTS OPT FOR MILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT'S MADE IT EVEN IT'S MADE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACTUALLY MAKE PROGRESS HERE AND ACTUALLY ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING PATIENTS. AND HELPING PEOPLE GET TACK AT THEIR LIVES ON TRACK. AT ANY OTHER PARTY PARTING WORDS OR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE FOR AT. DIRECTOR BOSS FROM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. NO NOT AT THIS TIME OKAY. AND AB I BELIEVE FIVE AGAIN BEFORE WE CLOSE HIS PANEL I WON IS JUST CYCLE BACK ACT. TO SUPERVISOR FULLY. I KNOW SUPERVISOR YOU HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR. AS DIRECTOR BOSS BEFORE WE CLOSE THIS PORTION OF THE HEARING. THANK YOU THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY WOMAN- SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF DETOX FACILITIES BEING LOCATED IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS THAT- THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS IS OVER CONCENTRATION SO. GIVEN THE COMMENTS BY DIRECTOR BOUGHT DO YOU AGREE THAT- OVER CONCENTRATION OR CLUSTERING OF DETOX FACILITIES ALL IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD OR ON A BLOCK ACTUALLY CREATE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. NO I DON'T I DON'T SEE HOW- IT HAVING SO THESE ARE BY THAT ERROR HOMES LOCATED NEAR ONE ANOTHER CREATES AN INSTITUTION I THINK OF INSTITUTION AS OUR STATE HOSPITALS I THINK ABOUT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HOSPITALS ETCETERA- AND SO IT JUST MAYBE JUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR COMMENT A LITTLE BIT MORE. THANK YOU SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE THE IN OUR CITY HERE COSTA MESA. THERE WAS ONE BLOCK AND IT WAS A COLD THE FACT STREET AND IT'S MUCH LIKE THE STREET THAT- THE DETOX FACILITY THAT- MISTER LEHRER LIVED IN- WHAT SITUATED. THERE WERE. FOUR DETOX OF THE LIVING HOMES- DRUG REHAB TREATMENT FACILITIES THAT HAD BOUGHT RESIDENTIAL HOMES THREE BUSINESSES ON ONE SMALL LITTLE CUL DE SAC LOT. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT LITTLE COLDER BACK NEIGHBORHOOD WAS IT TRANSFORMED INTO AN INSTITUTIONAL DOWN. AS THE OWNER FOR TREATMENT AND RECOVERY AND DETOX INSTEAD OF BEING A NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SO I WOULD. I REQUEST THAT AS YOUR APPROVING THESE LICENSES THAT YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS SO THAT YOU DON'T CONCENTRATE. DETOX FACILITIES ALL NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER. AND SHOT TRANSFORM WHAT ARE TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOODS INTO LITERALLY INSTITUTIONS FOR RECOVERY YEAH I HAVE BEEN. ONE THAT SEVERAL LIVING HOW LONG A DETOX FACILITY DRUG AND ALCOHOL TREATMENT FACILITY ALL NEXT TO EACH OTHER OR MAYBE A HOUSE IN BETWEEN THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING BECAUSE THERE ARE NO DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS SO THAT ORDINANCE THAT I WAS REFERRING TO EARLIER FOR THE CITY OF COSTA MESA AND THE COUNTY ORDINANCE AS WELL. REQUIRE THAT- SEVERAL LIVING HOMES NOT COLE LOCATED RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER THERE'S DISPENSING REQUIREMENTS THE STATE CURRENTLY DOES NOT AG ACKNOWLEDGE ANY KIND OF DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS AND SO THE DEPARTMENT IS ESSENTIALLY- LICENSING. HELLO OF- DETOX THIS REALLY JUST COUNTERED THIS IDEA THAT YOU NEED TO LIVE IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IN ORDER TO GET TREATMENT I APPRECIATE THAT CHAIRWOMAN'S- COMMENTS ABOUT THAT AS THE FAMILY MEMBER I JUST WANT MY LOVED ONE TO BE ABLE TO BE HELPED. MEDICALLY BECAUSE DETOX IS ACTUALLY QUITE RISKY FOR MANY HEALTH CONDITIONS SO WOULD YOU BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE DEFENSE TEAM REQUIREMENTS AT THE STATE LEVEL. I MEAN WE CAN DEFINITELY TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND I THINK OUR OUR GOAL IS THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ACCESS- FORTY SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND I THINK WE CAN CONTINUE JUST TO TALK THROUGH THESE TYPES OF IDEAS AND CONSIDERATIONS BUT YOU KNOW WE ARE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF TREATMENT AND RECOVERY SERVICES AND IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL SO I THINK IT'S AT A POINT THAT WE CAN FURTHER DISCUSS. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THERE'S A LACK OF ACCESS. I MEAN IN TERMS OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO THINK THROUGH BECAUSE WE MUST CERTIFY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS TOP OF MIND FOR US FOR ALL OF OUR SERVICES THAT WE DELIVER TO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. OKAY I KNOW YOU FOCUS ON THE MEDICARE PROGRAM- A LOT DURING GAIT CONVERSATION TODAY. BUT MANY OF THESE. DETOX FACILITY ARE. BEING PAID THROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE AND SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO AND WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO LOOK INTO THAT HOW THE PRIVATE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS ACTUALLY- THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE BUYING UP PROPERTIES AND OPENING UP DETOX FACILITIES. MORE SO THAN MEDIC CAL- HAITIANS- TREATMENT SERVICES. AGAIN I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN THINK THEY'RE IN THIS KIND OF SPEAKS TO THE POINT OF THE MANDATORY CERTIFICATION PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT ALL PROGRAMS REGARDLESS OF THE CARE SOURCE. ARE KIND OF MEET CERTAIN QUALITY STANDARDS. THANK YOU FOR A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES TO THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE AND SUPERVISION ONE OF THAT- CRITICAL COMPONENTS THAT THE COUNTY AND THE- CITY ORDINANCE HERE. IS THAT THERE BE TWENTY FOUR HOUR SUPERVISION WOULD YOU BE SUPPORTIVE OF A REQUIREMENT OF TWENTY FOUR HOUR SUPERVISION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THIS ONE. TURN OVER TO DOCTOR. THE FOURTEENTH AT THE TONE IS LICENSE TO DO DETOX. WE ALREADY HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS ABOUT- I OBSERVING CLIENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE DURING THE DETOX PROCESS AND YOU KNOW IF YOU DO YOU TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THOSE REQUIREMENTS. WHICH WE DID I HEAR IS TO PROVISION TWENTY FOUR HELPERS IN AND STUFF IN THE MAIL. IN LAKE IN. IS THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS A TO BE H. IT'S ERIC RENDON MONEY. PLAIN SIMPLE. INDIVIDUAL POLICIES WE'RE SORRY AND ARE IN WE'RE HAVING AT LEAST ON MY SENATE REALLY HERE THANK THE PROBABLY UP AND IT KINDA WHEN I WAITED YEARS ARE READ THE CASE ON MY TO THE PENSIONS OF UP AND TO. WHEN WE ARE NOT SEEING EVERY THIRTY NOT CHOI WHEN SOMEONE'S GOING TO IT YEAH BEAUTY TAX WE HAVE TO QUICKLY- TOWARDS FACILITIES THAT ARE MY TO PROVIDE ID DID YOU TRY FOUR HOUR MON. AND WE ALSO WORK THEM TO DETERMINE WHAT THEIR LEVEL OF IS HAVE BELIEVED HIM TO FURTHER AT EARLIER NAY HAS THAT THE LEVEL OF CARE FOR- MORE MEDICAL AND- WITH STRONG. VERSUS LAST NIGHT OF CLAIMS TRONG UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WITH THE OTHER LEVEL THE CARE. THANK YOU I'M NOT SURE WHY HAVE PANEL THANK CREATE THE- AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CAN- MAYBE STRICTER SPORTS AND MORE. AS INDIVIDUAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU I SUPERVISOR FULL AVERAGE US AND ON. I IS FRANCIS FOR PART OF TODAY'S COMMERCE AND I'M CERTAINLY WILL CAN. TO PARTNER WITH YOU AS THAT LOOKED RAISE TWO IN THIS INTO. WE THAT I'M WE ARE GOING TO TRAINS TO OUR FINAL PANEL BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP FOR. PUBLIC COMMENTS AND AT FOR OUR FINAL PANEL REALLY PLEASED TO. WELCOME HI JENNIFER LOS WHO IS JOINING US FROM THE HAZELDEN BETTY FORD FOUNDATION. MISS LEWIS WILL DISCUSS BEST PATIENT CARE PRACTICES HOW TO MAKE TREATMENT MORE EFFECTIVE. AND ANY SUCCESSES OR CHALLENGES THAT AT THE FOUNDATION HAS ENCOUNTERED WITH OUR CURRENT STATE LICENSING AND OVERSIGHT PRACTICES. WITH THAT I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR AT FOR BEING HERE WITH US THIS AFTERNOON. IF SO MUCH AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. MY NAME IS JENNIFER LAWRENCE THE AND THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR HITLER AND BETTY FORD FOUNDATION. AND I JUST WANNA START OUT BY THINKING THIS COMMITTEE AND CHAIR PETRIE-NORRIS FOR HER TIRELESS WORK ON THE REGULATORY REFORM INUSTRY AND FOCUS ON QUALITY STANDARDS INSTEAD IS. TO STRUCTURE TREATMENT. TABLE THEN BETTY FOR. IS THE LAW. NONPROFIT THAT IS TREATMENT PROVIDER IN THE COUNTRY. IT WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE AND TODAY HAS SEVENTEEN. FIVE AND NINE EIGHT. INCLUDING THE BETTY FORD CENTER IN RANCHO MIRAGE. AND TWO OTHER OUTPATIENT SITES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WE TREAT MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ANNUALLY INCLUDING THOUSANDS IN CALIFORNIA BOTH IN PERSON AT OUR CLINIC AND DIRECTIONAL SERVICES ACCREDITED GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ADDICTION STUDIES. A PUBLISHING HOUSE RESEARCH CENTER AN EDUCATION ARM FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS PREVENTION SERVICES AND A PROGRAM FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AFFECTED BY ADDICTION IN THE FAMILY. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT MANDATORY LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION OFALL OF THAT IT IS REGISTERED IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO THE SAFETY AND QUALITY CONCERNS MANY OF THE REFORMS THAT HAVE BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SUCH AS EIGHT ANTI PATIENT BROKERING AND MARKETING REFORMS ONLY APPLY TO CERTAIN LICENSED FACILITIES WHICH ALLOW THOSE THAT OPERATE UNDER THE RADAR AND TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT IS HARMFUL TO PATIENTS. CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE THAN BETTY FORD HAS AVAILED ITSELF EVERY OPTIONAL AND MANDATORY ACCREDITATION AND LYFT AND- THAT IS PART NETWORK. ALL OF OUR FACILITIES ACCREDITED BY THE JOINT COMMISSION. ARE HIRING STANDARDS FOR COUNSELING TEAM REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF A BACHELOR'S DEGREE LIFE OF EDUCATION. WITH STRONG PREFERENCE AND HIRING AT LEAST MASTER'S LEVEL CLINICIAN. THE BETTY FORD CENTER I LARGEST PROGRAMMING CALIFORNIA MAINTAINS LICENSE AND CERTIFICATION ALIGNED WITH THE DELIVERING A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE. WE HAVE LONG SUPPORTED QUALITY BASED CARE AND STANDARD AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT IF ALONE IT'S NOT AN EFFECTIVE INDICATOR TO DETERMINE THE QUALITY OF TREATMENT PATIENTS ARE RECEIVING. OTHER WHAT HAPPENED DURING THOSE TREATMENTS OUR IS MORE IMPORTANT. POLITIES START WITH SAFE MEDICAL DETOX SERVICES WHICH REQUIRE WELL TRAINED DOCTORS NURSES AND STATE MEDICAL FACILITIES. IT INCLUDES QUALIFIED WELL TRAINED ADDICTION COUNSELORS. HI INTERESTED PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO CAN PROVIDE EXCELLENT CLINICAL CARE FOR BOTH ADDICTION AND CO OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. PILOTY TREATMENT EVIDENCE BASED IF PATIENT CENTERED AND IT HONORED PATIENT DIGNITY IT HERE FOUND AN ARTICLE BUSINESS PRACTICES. IF COMPREHENSIVE ADJUSTING THE BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF ADDICTION. POLITY CARE CONNECT PATIENTS ON GOING RECOVERY SUPPORT OF PROFESSIONAL AND COMMUNITY BASED CARE SUPPORT. IT ALSO UTILIZES CLINICAL TECHNOLOGY AND DATA SYSTEMS THAT CAN BE USED TO MEASURE PATIENT OUTCOMES AND OTHER ASPECTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND DEVELOPING FRAMEWORK THAT INCENT QUALITY IN OUR FIELD. AND MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. ALTHOUGH MOST DO GREAT WORK IN ORDER TO ENSURE ETHICAL QUALITY CARE FOR THOSE WHO SEEK HELP PROTECTION WE SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH QUALITY STANDARD. AND A MANDATORY CONSISTENT ENFORCEABLE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ADDICTION TREATMENT INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY CONTINUES TO PURSUE CHANGES TO REGULATION WE HOPE THAT THESE CHANGES INCLUDE MANDATORY STANDARD FOR SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT PROVIDERS. IS A LIBERTY FOR DANCE READY TO HELP HOWEVER IT CAN TO HELP ADVANCE THE SUBJECT AT. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THAT MY BACKGROUND PRIOR TO COMING TO HIS LIPS AND BETTY FORD WITH AN ACUTE CARE. SINCE JOINING HIS IRWIN BETTY FORD. I REMAIN SHOCKED AT THE LACK OF COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IS FOCUSED ON PATIENT CARE. NOT JUST FOR TREATMENT PROVIDER. BUT FOR THOSE INVOLVED IN THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM. OVER HOME OPERATOR RECOVERY PROFESSIONALS AND MORE IN PART TO THE FACT THAT THIS SPECIALTY ADDICTION TREATMENT THE L. HAD LONG BEEN MARGINALIZED. AND IF STEP REMOVED FROM MAINSTREAM HEALTHCARE. NOT INTEGRATED NOT TAUGHT IN MEDICAL SCHOOL AND NOT EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT THE SPECIALTY APPROPRIATELY. SIGMAR HAVE KEPT IT SEPARATED WHICH IS ONE REASON THAT IS BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS UNDER THIS THEIR OVERSIGHT. I HOPE TO BE PART OF CHANGING THAT AND I THINK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT QUALITY AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AT FOR YOUR REMARKS AND ALSO FOR YOUR IN YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS SPACE. HI MY OFFICE AND THAT AND I WE HAVE BEEN SO GRATEFUL FOR. HIS OPEN BETTY FORD'S ENGAGEMENT ON THE SUBJECT WITH US WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES. ON DEVELOPING A ROBUST FRAMEWORK FOR. AT MANDATORY CERTIFICATION AND LICENSURE TO ENSURE THAT WE DO YOU RAISE STANDARDS FOR PATIENT CARE AND NOT REALLY IS. WHAT IS AT THE HEART OF THIS EFFORT I THINK LIKE YOU- I'VE BEEN REALLY SHOCKED- AS I HAVE DUG INTO THIS ISSUE BY JUST HOW LAX. THE OVERSIGHT IS AND AT I THINK THAT. GIVEN THAT IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE THAT THIS SPACE CONTINUES TO BE THE WILD WILD WEST- BUT AS YOU SAID. JUST BECAUSE THIS EVERY NIGHT AT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE MORE BROADLY BUT PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT. HAS BEEN- KIND OF MARGINALIZED AND STIGMATIZED. WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO CONTINUE AND WE NEED TO UPDATE AND UPGRADE OUR STANDARDS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE ALL ACROSS THE STATE I'M IN ORDER TO TACKLE WHAT I THINK IS ONE OF ADDED THE MOST PROFOUND CHALLENGES. FACING FACING US TODAY- AND- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I HAVE. WELL THEY DO HAVE ONE I HAVE ONE SPECIFIC QUESTION BECAUSE IT SAID AND ISSUE THAT CAME UP- IN IN OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATION. RELATED TO. THE LOCATION I'VE IN PURCHASE OF SETTING SPECIFICALLY THESE THESE DETOX FACILITIES SO I'M A- FIRST QUESTION IS HOW LONG TYPICALLY AS SOMEONE. DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF A DETOX TREATMENT HOW LONG DOES THAT LAST THAT'S KIND OF DETOXIFICATION PHASE MAYBE IF YOU CAN JUST MAYBE DESCRIBE KIND OF THAT THE CONTINUE CONTINUE M. OF RECOVERY CARE WHICH YOU KNOW WOULD BEGIN WITH DETOX AND HOW LONG TYPICALLY DO THESE THINGS TAKE. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I'M HAPPY TO COMMENT AND- YEAH ONE OF THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS AS A CLINICIAN MIGHT CLEAN ME UP ON ON ANY- TECHNICAL- THINGS BECAUSE I'M NOT A CLINICIAN. HOWEVER YOU KNOW WHEN. WE LOOK AT DETOX YOU KNOW WE HAVE A YOU KNOW ANY QUEUE AREA AS- AND WE TRY TO INTEGRATE- EVEN AT THE DETOX PLAN- THAT THAT- COUNSELING SERVICES AND OTHER SUPPORT THE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THAT INDIVIDUAL EVEN WHILE THEY'RE IN DETOX THIRTY TAX MIGHT LOOK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT OUR FACILITIES THAN IT DOES IN SOME OF. THE DETOX ONLY FOR THIRTY EIGHT BECAUSE WE DO START TO INTEGRATE OF COUNSELING SERVICES GROUP DYNAMICS AND EVEN WILD FOLKS ARE. DETECTING AND IT ALSO DEPENDS ON A LITTLE BIT ONLINE- YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE. USED DISORDER PATIENT MEANING THAT THEY HAVE- MULTIPLE THAT IS THAT THE IRAQI TAXING IN AND OUT- SO WE'RE. THE LIKE- AFTER PASSED ACT- IF BLINK COME IN ON THAT WELL A. B. L. DEFECT HAN ON. THAT THE ATTACKS PROCESS WAS SO INITIAL THERE IS A COMPREHENSIVE. AND THAT IF I- USUALLY EMPLOYS A SAM CRITERIA TO LOOK AT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL BEING ADMITTED SO THINGS LIKE PAST MEDICAL HISTORY ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS- THE SPECIFICS OF THE- TYPES OF SUBSTANCES THAT THEY WERE USING AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF. KENYA CAN THE FACILITY HANDLE THAT SO TO GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WITH AN ALCOHOL USE DISORDER WHO HAS HAD MULTIPLE ADMISSIONS AND HAS EXPERIENCED DELIRIUM TREMENS WHICH IS A VERY TRAGIC- SIDE. YOU KNOW BUT COMPLICATION. OF A SEVERE ALCOHOL USE WITHDRAWAL. THAT PERSON WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR AVERAGE LEVEL THREE- YOU KNOW DETOX CENTER- EVEN YOU KNOW THAT PERSON WOULD NEED TO BE IN A MORE OF A- MEDICALLY MANAGED POSSIBLY HOSPITAL BASED TYPE OF FACILITY THAT HAS THE TYPES OF THINGS LIKE. AYE VISA AND- OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT I SEE YOU ACCESS UP SO THAT THE TERMINATION NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE BEGINNING AND IF DONE IN THE INAPPROPRIATELY WHICH IS. ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SAY- IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD CRITICIZE A LOT OF TREATMENT CENTERS IS THAT. BUT THE MEDICAL STAFF BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN THIS- YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE EVOLUTION IN THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF HOW TREATMENT CENTERS HAVE EVOLVED. IT BACK IN THE DAY THEY WERE JUST THEY WERE STRIPPED OF MEDICAL ALMOST COMPLETELY I MEAN UNTIL RECENTLY IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT WITH IMS COULD YOU A PHYSICIAN EVEN GO INTO A FACILITY LIKE THAT TO DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. TO ENSURE SAFETY- AND SO THERE'S BEEN THIS. KIND OF SUPPORT IN THE ROAD IN OF A CLINICAL APPROACH VERSUS A MEDICAL APPROACH WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE HMAN BEING. REGARDLESS THAT YOU KNOW YOU NEED ALL THAT IS COMPREHENSIVE AND SO- BUT BUT IF THAT DETERMINATION GETS DONE INAPPROPRIATELY THAN A PERSON GETS ADMITTED INAPPROPRIATELY AND ALL SORTS OF BAD THINGS HAPPEN AND THEN. ISSUES AROUND STAFFING AND- WHAT WAS ALREADY MENTIONED YOU KNOW LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE EVERY THIRTY MINUTES CHECKS FOR VITAL SIGNS IN A YEAR. THIS IS WHERE YOU BEGIN TO SEIZE IT WHEN IT WHEN THERE'S BREAK DOWNS- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE BUT IT TYPICALLY IN AN UNCOMPLICATED SITUATION FOR ALCOHOL MAYBE THREE TO FIVE DAYS. BUT TYPICALLY FOR OPIOIDS YOU MIGHT BE FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS IF THEY'RE USING- AT A TAPER. WITH THAT MEDICATION LIKE BUPRENORPHINE. BENDED AS- WHICH IS SEDATIVE. ARE TRIANGLE. CAN SOMETIMES TAKE A BIT. AND CASES TIMES WHAT ISN'T INSERTED INTO THE ISSUE IS. COVERAGE SO IS IT A COVERED DAY FOR THEM TO IS THE INSURANCE COMPANY- SAYING NO IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE AND THERE'S JUST BACK AND FORTH THAT. THE FACILITY IS ALWAYS ASKING FOR MORE BAD DAYS. AND THEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ARE TRYING TO COMPARE TO THEIR UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT TO SEE IF IT'S APPROPRIATE. SO THERE'S THIS DANCE THAT HAPPENS BACK AND FORTH MANY VARIABLES AND THEN THERE'S THE EVOLUTION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. THAT YOU KNOW WITH WITH THE PATIENTS SO WE HAD THIS WEIRD SYSTEM WITH EVEN WITH IMS. THAT YOU CAN YOU COULD DO MEDICAL THINGS THAT ARE RELATED TO DETOX. BUT YOU'RE NOT REALLY SUPPOSED TO BE DOING MEDICAL THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SEND THEM OUT. TO A PROVIDER OUTSIDE OF THAT FACILITY TO GET THAT TAKEN CARE OF AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE. LET'S SAY SOMEBODY COMES IN WITH THE INSULIN PUMP. AND AND THEN MAYBE AN INFECTION THAT NEEDS AN INCISION AND DRAINAGE. BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE INJECT INTO THEIR ARM FOR EXAMPLE OR OTHER THINGS- PNEUMONIA. TECHNICALLY THAT'S NOT DETOX SO I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A MEDICATION TO DO AN INTERVENTION. THIS IS A SEND THEM OUT TO AN URGENT CARE FACILITY TO AT THEIR PRIVATE DOCTOR OR ANOTHER WAY TO SET IT UP. WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THAT IF YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDST OF WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT- THAT SOMEBODY. PUT YOU IN A VAN AND SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE AND WE JUST WOULDN'T DO THESE THINGS FOR OTHER CONDITIONS- YOU KNOW LAY ABOUT THE PRESSURES. SO BUT BUT THAT'S KIND OF THE GENERAL GIST THAT EVALUATION. THEN THERE'S THE- CARRYING OUT OF MEDICATION MANAGEMENT USUALLY- THE LICENSE- AT PRESCRIBER WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME OF THE MEDICATIONS DIFFERENT FACILITIES WOULD DO IT DIFFERENTLY WHERE SOMETIMES IT JUST. PATIENT COMES IN WIT THEIR- PRESCRIPTION. AND OTHER FACILITIES THEY HAVE THE WAY THAT THEY CAN GET ORDERED IF THEY HAVE AN IRON MASK IN ORDER TO THEIR THE TRONIC MEDICAL RECORD THEN IT GETS THERE. THE MUSIC. OF PROBLEMS ABOUT GETTING MEDICINES- DON'T EVEN. GET ME STARTED THERE THANK THE- IS FILLING MEDICINES LIKE CUBAN. IN ORANGE COUNTY. THIS IS A PLAGUE WE- GET. PHARMACY TO. IT AND THEN PATIENTS GOING AROUND FIVE SIX SEVEN PLACES. AND AND YOU KNOW LOOKING FOR. WHERE JUST WHERE TO GET SOURCE THEIR MEDICATIONS AND THAT BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR TREATMENT CENTERS THAT ARE IN HOMES THAT YOU MENTIONED WHERE THEY'RE JUST SENDING SOMEBODY ATTACK OUT IN YOU KNOW TO GO PICK UP PICK UP THE METS. THIS IS NOT A PLACE WITH A PHARMACY THAT DISPENSES THE MEDICATIONS AND YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE MEDICATION THERE COULD BE A WHOLE DAY. THAT PASSES BEFORE YOU EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR MEDICATIONS THAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED A DAY AGO- IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN A YOU KNOW ISSUES OF WHY WE GET BAD OUTCOMES FOR THAT AS WELL. SO LIKE I SAID DON'T GET ME STARTED BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF AREAS THAT'S THE GENERAL GIST OF HOW THAT DID THE DETOX PROCESS HAPPENS IN THE NUMBER OF DAYS TO EXPECT. I THINK YOU GET THANK YOU FOR JUMPING IN ON THAT QUESTION AND PROVIDING THAT CONTEXT AND- I'M- I THINK WHEN. ONE QUESTION I'D HAVE OPPOSED TO BOTH OF YOU. IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY MEDICLLY APPROPRIATE FOR THESE INTENSE HE SAID IT'S WE'RE TALKING THREE TO FIVE DAYS OR FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS ON AVERAGE. IS IT MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE FOR THESE DETOX FACILITIES TO BE IN SOMEBODY'S GARAGE. WELL SO PROBABLY NOT A GARAGE RIGHT SO THERE'S THAT THERE THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN ALMOST LIKE AND IF IT'S IF IT'S A VERY MILD WITHDRAWAL AND THIS IS WHY YOU NEED YOU NEED THE SKILL OF SOMEBODY THAT UNDERSTANDS HOW TO EVEN APPEAR APPROPRIATELY- GAUGE WHAT THAT WHAT THAT IS AND THAT'S WHY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SAME CRITERIA FOR EXAMPLE A LEVEL FOUR WOULD BE THE PERSON THAT I MENTIONED THAT HAD STATE HISTORY OF DELIRIUM TREMENS OR HISTORY OF SEIZURES. THEY DON'T LOOK GOOD BUT LET'S SAY SOMEBODY THAT- YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN DRINKING FOR. THREE OR FOUR WEEKS- AND THEY SHOW UP AND IT NEVER HAD ANY SORT OF OTHER MEDICAL ISSUES OR ANYTHING ALONG THAT LINE. THAT PERSON OFTENTIMES WE JUST. YOU KNOW ARE NOT NECESSARILY NEED A NEED MEDICATIONS- SO. THERE'S DEFINITELY A LOT OF SPECIFICS TO THE FACILITY KIND OF LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE A FEW SOME PEOPLE GET HOME HEALTH. WE DO DO WE DO DO- MEDICAL TREATMENTS AND MEDICAL THERAPIES IN PEOPLE'S HOMES- JUST IN GENERAL IN OTHER AREAS OF MEDICINE. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT IF IT'S NOT APPROPRIATELY ASSESSED. WHICH IS KIND OF A THE WAY I THINK YOU MAY BE GETTING AT IS THAT THERE COULD BE PEOPLE THAT NEED MORE. THAN A HOME CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE AND THAT'S NOT ENDORSED EVEN BY THE SAME CRITERIA. SO WHEN THAT GOES WRONG BAD THINGS HAPPEN. YES YES THEY DO. I WILL WITH THAT AT THE STATE THANK YOU AGAIN DR BROUGHT BARTOLOMMEO THANK YOU AND- ADD TO JENNIFER LACEY. JOINING US FROM HAZELDEN BETTY FORD I WILL GO AHEAD AND CONCLUDE. OUR WITNESS TESTIMONY AND I TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT. BOB SO AS WE TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT I JUST.

THEY ALSO BLEND INTO THE COMMUNITIES THAT PROVIDE THE VERY TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR CLIENTS THAT THIS TYPE OF FACILITY WAS SPECIFICALLY INTENDED TO PRODUCE HOWEVER AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD THE STATE DOES NOT CONSIDER THE PROJECT MANY OF ONE LICENSED HOME TO ANOTHER AND THIS HAS LED TO OVER CONCENTRATION. IN SOME OF NEWPORT BEACH IS NEIGHBORHOODS AS THOSE IN OTHER COMMUNITIES NEARBY SUCH AS COSTA MESA AND YOU HEARD MARK. THIS COULD COMPLETELY UNDERMINES THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING TREATMENT IN A RESIDENTIAL SETTING AND IT IS DAMAGING THE CHARACTER OF QUALITY OF LIFE OF RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS THESE ARE BUSINESSES AFTER ALL WITHIN POINTS COMING GOING DELIVERY TRUCKS AND OTHER IMPACTS THAT DO MAKE THE HOME DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE COULD DISTANCING AN OVER CONCENTRATION CONSIDERATIONS. INTO ITS LICENSING PROCESS. AS YOU IN THE LAST MINUTES INADA LIE. AND FOR IS A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE PRICE. THANK ARE TODAY AND THE PATIENTS ARE NOT RECOVERING. THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE ARE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THE OUTCOMES AND HOW ARE PATIENTS BEING SUCCESSFULLY TREATED AND I KNOW YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS FROM OTHER CALLERS.

THANK YOU COUNCIL MEMBER. WHY FORTY SIX YOU ARE OPEN. HI MY NAME IS BETH DALY ALUM AND I'M A RESIDENT OF ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO- I'D LIKE TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE HAVING AN UNLICENSED RECOVERY RESIDENTS. THAT WAS LEFT WAS WAS NEXT DOOR TO MEFOR A YEAR AND A HALF AND I AM ASKING THAT YOU ALL CONSIDER THAT THESE UNLICENSED RECOVERY RESIDENCES SHOULD ALSO BE LICENSE NOT JUST THE DETOX FACILITIES BECAUSE THESE ARE ALL SATELLITE BUSINESSES OF THE CORE- BACK CARE BUSINESSES. THEY ARE NOT WANTED ALL INTO OUR COMMUNITY THEY HAD TWELVE MEN THAT SOMETIMES COED- LIVING NEXT DOOR TO US WITH TWO PEOPLE ROTATING CHECKING IN ON THEM ADMINISTERING MEDICINES AND PROVIDING FOOD THEY DON'T ANSWER THE DOOR IF THERE'S A NOISE COMPLAINT OR A CONCERN WE CONSTANTLY HAD. NOISE NUISANCE LANGUAGE NEWSSTANDS MOPING WE HAD METHADONE THROWN INTO OUR YARD WE GET STUDENTS THAT WILL BEING USED CLEARLY AS DRUG PARAPHERNALIA AND NEEDLE BEING THROWN INTO OUR YARD AND YOUNG MEN IN THEIR IN THEIR RECOVERY EXPERIENCED ROTATING IN AND OUT- EVERY TWO WEEKS IT WAS A NEW CROP OF PEOPLE EVERY TWO WEEKS WHICH IS NOT. TYPICAL OF THE NORMAL FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE YOU HAVE CONSISTENT NEIGHBORS THAT YOU GET. TO KNOW- EITHER THIS WAS PART OF A BUSINESS OPERATION OF A LARGE- PROVIDER THAT HAD D. TAX THAT. AND RENTED ON LIFE RECOVER RATHER- WHEN IT'S HARD A NEIGHBOR BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO TO COMPLAIN TO WHEN YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THESE DRUGS THAT ARE BEING THROWN OVER IN YOUR YARD AND YOUR DOG HAS A BOTTLE OF SOMEONE'S METHADONE NOW. IT'S NOT FAIR TO US IN COMMUNITIES THE CRIME WENT FROM NO NOTHING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH IS A PRETTY SLEEPY NEIGHBORHOOD JUST THROUGH THE ROOF WE HAVE FOURTEEN BREAK INS AND FOR MONTHS. AND THIS YOU KNOW I DEEPLY VALUES THAT PEOPLE NEED GOOD. RECOVERY CARE BUT THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT IN UNLICENSED RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT AND NO WAY FOR US TO VOICE CONCERNS OR FOR THE PATIENT TO VOICE CONCERNS- IT DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE- FIELD COMMUNITY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD- AND I DON'T THINK WAS PROVIDING THEM GOOD CARE IT WAS JUST AN INSURANCE FRAUD SCHEME. SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER CREATING A STATUTE WERE ALL FACILITIES DETOX AND RECOVERY RESIDENCES THAT ARE BUSINESSES IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS THE LICENSE ESPECIALLY IF THOSE BUSINESSES ARE SATELLITE OF ACTIVE RECOVERY BUSINESSES. THANK YOU SO MUCH REPRESENT PETRIE-NORRIS FOR LEADING THE DISCUSSION HERE AND FOR BRINGING SO MANY GREAT RESOURCES TO CONSIDERATION BUT PLEASE I. P. H. C. S- NEEDS TO. WORK IN A GRAY THE WHOLE.

HELLO MY NAME IS JOY BRENNER- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING TODAY ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE I KNOW YOU COULD BEACH CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND A MAJOR SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION FOR ME AND MY CONSTITUENTS IS OUR INABILITY TO ADDRESS CONCERNS WITH STATE LICENSE GROUP HOME A LOCAL LEVEL. IN NEWPORT BEACH WE HAVE SOBER LIVING FACILITIES THAT ARE UNLICENSED WITH SIX UNDER RESIDENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LOCAL COMMUNITY AND THE CITY REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT R. ORDINANCE ANTHONY OVERSIGHT HELP INSURE THE HOME BLEND INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO FOR THE GOOD OF THE RESIDENTS. OF THE HOME AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY WHEN THERE'S A COMPLAINT WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE OPERATOR TO RESOLVE THAT I CAN GIVE YOU MORE THAN A DECADE OF EXAMPLES OF HOW OUR PROCESS TO FACILITATE THIS LITTLE LIST OF OPERATORS THAT WORK WITH US ON A RESPONSIVE TO SURROUNDING RESIDENTS. HOWEVER WE HAVEN'T COMMITTED A NEW FACILITY SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE WHY MANY OPERATORS SEEM TO KNOW IT EASIER TO APPLY FOR AN OPERATOR GROUP HOME WITH SIX OR FEWER RESIDENTS LICENSED AND REGULATED BY THE. STATE D. H. YEAH. THERE'S LESS OVERSIGHT WHEN MANAGER BY AGE LOW MORE FOUR MILES AWAY IT'S A- TO US AND A RED. FOR THE RULES ARE AND HOW YOU ENFORCE THEM HOW DO THE STATE GAME COMPLY. AND ITS LICENSE INFO AT UP. IN THE MANNER OF THE STATE. THEM TO WE DON'T THINK THEY ARE THE CITY COOPER. OF THE FACILITIES THEY LAW THE VERY LIMITS WHAT WE CAN DO TO RESOLVE THEM WE NEED STRONGER STATE OVER SO AND- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IT TO HAPPEN IN ORANGE NOT SACRAMENTO AND IF YOU CANNOT PROVIDE ANYTHING COUNTY SHOULD BE GRANTED OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS TO ENABLE US TO STEP IN WHEN THERE ARE ISSUES OF LOCAL CONCERN. WE NEED TO GIVE US BACK THE ABILITY TO LICENSE THE FAILITY SO THAT WE CAN REGULATE THEM AND ENFORCE AGAINST THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN BETTER WORK TOGETHER TO PROTECT ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS BOTH THOSE IN AND AROUND. THE GROUP HOMES THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAN MEMBER THERE THIS IS WENDY MAK. AND- I WANT TO THINK ASSEMBLY COUNTY PETRIE-NORRIS FOR DOING SAID ABOUT- MY PREPARED STATEMENT IS THIS EVERY ELEVEN MINUTES SOMEBODY IS DYING OF A DRUG OVERDOSE BY THE END OF THIS HEARING SIXTEEN US CITIZENS WILL HAVE DIED OF A DRUG OVERDOSE THIS CURRENT MODEL OF THE TREATMENT IS NOT WORKING AND WE NEED TO FIX IT NOW. NO MORE FOR PROFIT TREATMENT NO MORE TREATMENT IN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS OUR COUNTRY PAYS FOR DIALYSIS TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE AFFLICTED WITH DIABETES IN MEDICAL SETTINGS WITH OVERSIGHT AND IT'S TRYING TO MAKE A DICTION TREATMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH THREE THE PEOPLE AFFLICTED BY ADDICTION. THEY NEED A COMMERCIAL AREA WITH THE ENTIRE MODEL IS OF TREATMENT IS REDESIGNED NO MORE NINETY DAYS STAYS TIMES TWENTY IN DANGEROUS HOMES WITH UNTRAINED STAFF WHERE THE OWNERS MAKE BILLIONS YOU NEED TO LOOK LIKE A ONE YEAR MINIMUM SOBER HOUSING WHICH SHALL ADDRESS OUR HOMELESS PROBLEM MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ON SITE FOR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH DENTAL AND VISION. FREE MEDICATION JOB TRAINING G. EDIE'S WE WANT TO GIVE OUR KIDS A FIGHTING CHANCE AS IT IS WE ARE USING A SCRIPT. ON TO PUT OUT A FOREST FIRE. ALRP CAN NEEDS TO BE A PART FOR THE PRO. OR IN SIXTY MONTHS WHICH IS JUST FIVE YEARS THE DEATH TOLL IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND MORE DEATHS. AND THOUSANDS MORE INEFFICIENT AND DANGEROUS HOUSES. THAT HOLD THEMSELVES OUT AND BILL OUT AS PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION AND NON MEDICAL FACILITY. NEEDS TO STOP NOW THERE'S ANOTHER DISASTER ON THE HORIZON AND A HUGE POTENTIAL FOR ANOTHER MONEY GRAB BECAUSE IT IS WAY TOO EASY TO SET UP SHOP. SB NINE WOULD ENABLE THE CREATION OF AN ESTIMATED SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE UNITS IN THE STATE'S EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS THAT MEANS EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA CAN TEAR DOWN THEIR HOUSE AND BUILD DUPLEXES. UNLESS THEY'RE IN A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT WE MUST HAVE FORESEEABILITY AND WE NEED TO TAKE A BOLD STEP NOW OR IT WILL BE A DISASTER OR EVERYONE WILL GET INTO THE BUSINESS OF RECOVERY. AS A REHAB OR SOBER LIVING WITH INEPT OVERSIGHT AGENCY THAT IS MORE CONCERNED WITH MONEY REVENUES WITH A LONG STANDING RECORD OF USELESS OVERSIGHT. THIS IS THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE PROBLEM AND THE P. H. C. S. IS THE WRONG AGENCY TO OVERSEE THIS INDUSTRY AS IT HAS PROVED TIME AND TIME AGAIN. TO BE AN INEFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT BODY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BRINGING SOLUTIONS I'M GOING TO GO OVER MY TIME BECAUSE I HAVE. AN EFFECT BUT AN IMPORTANT THING TO SAY PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE ON ONE SIDE YOU'VE GOT.

DOWN I WANT TO SAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS NUMBER ONE IS THAT EITHER THE STATE IS IN CONFERENCE BY WHAT I'M HERE TODAY AND OR THEY ARE A- TO A THIS OF ALL THESE CONCERN THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD ON THIS CALL THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY TRAVESTY TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND I'M SICK WHEN I CALLED THE STATE. HERE THAT WE CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANYONE WE YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ARE THE RESIDENTS OF THE STREET THAT WE HAVE TO IN DOOR. THE POLICE CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND GUESS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WE'VE HAD THREE INCIDENCES WHERE PEOPLE ARE DROPPED OFF. THE CATCHER READ. OR OFF THEY KNOCK ON NEIGHBORS DOORS THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE ADDRESS OF WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO. AND JUST THE OTHER DAY THEY KNOCKED ON THE DOOR DID RESIDENTS OPENED HIS DOOR AND THE GIRLS WALK IN HIS HOUSE. YEAH WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THAT SITUATION. SOMETHING LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN NEWPORT BEACH THIS IS NOT NEEDS HAS STOCK AND WHEN THESE HOUSES ARE WE LET I LIVE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. THE STAFF HAVE NO AYE DATE THEIR BABYSITTERS WHERE IS THE OVERSIGHT IN DO THEY EVEN LOOK AT THE APPLICATION OF THESE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING THERE. AND I CAN TELL YOU I GET A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST SIX MONTHS AGO. FOR THE PROGRAM OF THIS HOUSE AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT YET AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY TELL ME AT THE STATE. WE HAVE WE HAVE ONLY ARE TEN TO TWENTY PEOPLE WORKING ON THAT ON- ON THESE THINGS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS NOT MY PROBLEM. IT IS THE STATE'S PROBLEMS WHICH BECOME MY PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR JOB. AND I AM APPALLED AT SOME OF THE STORIES I AM HEARING TODAY. AND WHERE ARE ARE RIGHT. WHERE ARE THE RESIDENTS RIGHT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS TO ME WHAT WE HAVE NO RIGHT. AND WHERE IS LOCAL CONTROL I AGREE WITH THE THIRD PATH CALLER WE NEED LOCAL CONTROL ART CITY TOLD US WE CAN DO NOTHING. AND PLAYING. GOT THE STOCK THANK YOU MA'AM FOR YOUR COMMENTS I CERTAINLY AGREE. AND MODERATOR HOW MANY COLORS DO WE HAVE AT REMAINING IN THE QUEUE. WE HAVE THREE LEFT QUEUED READ AND SHARE. ONE SIXTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. FIVE POINT SIXTY ONE YOU ARE OPEN. NINE SIXTY ONE. THREE NINE SIXTY ONE MARCH RIGHT SIX NINE SIXTY ONE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR US WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE HEARING YOU. RIGHT YEAH SHE'S **** A COUPLE TIMES IF SHE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE CALLED TO MY SIXTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. WELL PLEASE RE QUEUE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT OVER LINE SIXTY TWO. HI IN MY LINE SIXTY TWO YES CORRECT THERE'S BEEN SOME TECHNICAL PROBLEMS- BUT I AM PLEASED TO SEE THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY TAKING PUBLIC COMMENTS TODAY BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO A PRECEDENT IN THE LEGISLATURE LIKE WITH THE COURTS HEARING AND LORENA GONZALEZ'S WATCHING INEQUITIES COMMITTEE HEARING- LAST WEEK THERE WAS A% HOMELESS HEARING MORE PUBLIC COMMENT WAS NOT TAKEN. JUST FOR THE RECORD. WITH THAT BEING SAID- I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS ISSUE- THIS WAS AN INSIGHTFUL HEARING TODAY- BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS I DID LIVE- WHEN MY FAMILY OF- THREE YOUNG CHILDREN AND I LIVED- IN THE BAY AREA ABOUT FIFTEEN. MILES FROM THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE WE LIVED IN NEAR I. TWENTY TWO BED FACILITY. THAT OFFERS- TREATMENT- TO PEOPLE- WITH CONVICTIONS. AND SO- I'M MORE COMMENTING TODAY FROM EXPERIENCE WHOLE STANDPOINT- I COULD NOT LET MY CHILDREN OUT OF THE APARTMENT. BASED ON- THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT WENT ON. AND SOMEONE CONNECTED TO THAT- FACILITY BROKE INTO OUR- APARTMENT ONE NIGHT- LOOKING FOR DRUGS AND SO THAT WAS A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE FOR MY FAMILY AND I AND THE ROLE OF WAS WE WERE LIVING IN AN AREA WHERE IT'S A TWO BEDROOM EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT- MOLD AND LEAD INFESTED APARTMENT FOR FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR LITERALLY THE ONLY HOUSING THAT WE COULD FIND- AND SO WE EVENTUALLY- WERE- PROPELLED TO LEAVE THAT AREA- LONG STORY SHORT TOO LATE MOVED TO SONOMA COUNTY IT BURNED DOWN. NOW HERE IN SACRAMENTO- AND I'VE HAD MY SERVICE FINGERS AND FEELERS A LITTLE BIT MORE ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY- I AM PLEASED YOU'RE TAKING PUBLIC COMMENT BUT THE KIND OF THING THAT I'M HEARING FROM THE CALLERS TODAY I THINK SPEAKS TO NOT ONLY THE ISSUES WITH THIS- TOPIC IN CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE- GREATER INCOMPETENCE AND INEPTITUDE OF THE LEGISLATURE AND JUST THE LEVELS AND WAY AND- THE JUST OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS ON HEARING PARTICULARLY FROM THESE. COMMENTS OF HOW OLD YOU ARE TOTALLY FAILING YOU THE SUPERMAJORITY LEGISLATURE IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOT ONLY WITH THIS ISSUE BUT YOU KNOW I'M I'M SITTING HERE TALKING TO YOU CHARGED IN SUPPLY OF KNOW CELL PHONE IN THE CAR BECAUSE MY POWERS DOWN I MEAN YOU NAME IT CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS ARE FAILING ITS CITIZENS AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY MANY PLACES AND ISSUES. WHERE THE SUPERMAJORITY. SAME TO BE COME. IN AND THIS. YOU MAY LEARN WILL THE PEOPLE SO THAT YOUR MINUTES ARE UP BUT WE ARE GREAT FOR YOUR INPUT AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT CALLER. ONE SIXTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DENISE OVER MOUNT AND I WOULD LIKE TO I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF INTEGRAL FACILITY- AS AN AREA THAT REQUIRES. SOME IMPROVE PROCESS IMPROBABILITIES JUST VERY QUICKLY DEFINED AS MULTIPLE STATE LICENSES AND OR UNLICENSED RESIDENTIAL CARE TREATMENT. AND SO CALLED SOBER LIVING FACILITIES- ARE THOSE WHICH OPERATE UNDER COMMON MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE OR SERVICE FRAMEWORK- BUSINESSES OPERATING INTENT OF GROW FACILITIES HAVE DRIVEN THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE OVER CONCENTRATION THAT EXCELS- IN NEIGHBORHOODS AND DOOR LOCATION INCOMPATIBLE TO THE SURROUNDING USES LIKE THE SCHOOLS AND DAY CARE. FOR SUPERVISION AND ULTIMATELY THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES- THAT WE'VE HEARD DESCRIBED TODAY ASSOCIATED WITH- INEFFECTIVE- PLANNING ON THE FRONT END. AND OPERATING SUPERVISION- MENIKAH BUSINESSES HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE STATE LICENSURE- KNOWN AS THE SIX UNDER. STANDALONE FACILITY TO PRESENT THIS AS A PLATFORM. FOR OPENING WITHOUT ANY COUNTRY ON WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL CONTROL THE UNLICENSED FACILITIES AND OR RELATED FACILITIES SO THAT THEY ARE EXPLOITING- THE PERMISSION TO OPERATE AND THE DESIGNATION OF THE SUPERVISOR ACROSS A MUCH BROADER PLATFORM OF CLIENTS OR PATIENTS AND LOCATIONS. SO UNDER THIS TYPE OF MODEL IT WOULDN'T BE UNCOMMON. FOR AN OPERATOR TO HAVE REALLY A SINGLE MANAGER GOING ACROSS MULTIPLE FACILITIES IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS. UNABLE TO SAY THAT DOESN'T THAT DOES NOT SATISFY THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CONSTANCY PROVISION. THAT IS REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY HELP TO TREAT AND PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO PEOPLE THAT ARE ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE RECOVERY. THE OTHER EXAMPLE IS THE UNLICENSED FACILITIES STORE ALSO. EITHER IN COMBINATION WITH SOME STATE LICENSED FACILITY OR OTHER THEY HAVE CREATED A CLUSTER INTEGRAL FACILITY AND AGAIN NOT LEVERAGING WHAT'S A GROSSLY DEFICIENT AMOUNT OF- SUPERVISION AND IN CARE- A CROSS SMALL LOCATIONS AND MULTIPLE PATIENTS. SO YOU KNOW SOME OF THE RESULTS OF THAT HAVE BEEN THAT MEDICATIONS- HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED BY PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO CONTROL THOSE. YOU KNOW THEY THEY'RE DODGING REQUIREMENTS WE NEED. IN IN NEWPORT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE FACILITY IN THE CITY THAT IS ACTUALLY TRULY A STANDALONE SIX AND UNDER MA'AM TELL MIKE MA'AM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS- I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO WRAP UP- BUT WE WILL CERTAINLY CONTINUE. THE SAD THIS DIALOGUE ON ON THAT TOPIC THANK YOU FOR JOINING US OKAY. THANK YOU TO. AND THERE NEEDS TO BE CONTROL. THERE NEEDS TO BE CONTROLLED THE FRONT END TO IDENTIFY ALL FACILITIES THAT ARE GOING INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ONE SIXTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. FIVE ARE YOU MUTED PLEASE ON MUTE. NINE SIXTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. WE I THINK YOU'RE MUTED SIXTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THEY ARE NOT RESPONDING- WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THE QUEUE ALL RIGHT OUT OF JAIL THANK YOU AB MODERATOR AND- WITH THAT WE WILL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT AND- GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THIS HEARING I DO WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS. WHO JOINED US TODAY AND ALSO EVERYONE WHO JOINED US ON THE PHONE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY AND PUBLIC COMMENT. INCLUDING ALL ALL SIMPLY AT SAY THAT AS WE'VE SAID THROUGHOUT THE HEARING WE ALL KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS BATTLED THE DEMONS OF ADDICTION. A FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR FAMILY MEMBER PERHAPS PERHAPS EVEN OURSELVES AND IN CALIFORNIA ALONE APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE ARE WRESTLING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. TRAGICALLY ONLY 10% OF THESE CALIFORNIANS WILL RECEIVE ANY TYPE OF ASSISTANCE ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. AND AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY EVEN FEWER WILL RECEIVE HIGH QUALITY TREATMENT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHILE THERE ARE GOOD ACTORS THEY'RE DOING GOOD WORK TO HELP THOSE IN RECOVERY FAR TOO MANY BAD ACTORS ARE EXPLOITING PATIENTS FOR PROFITS AND- WE NEED TO DRAMATICALLY RAISE STANDARDS IN THIS INDUSTRY WE NEED TO ENSURE QUALITY. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE WE NEED TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND PROVIDERS. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING DIRECTED TO PROVEN PROGRAMS THAT REALLY WORK. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS WORK WITH OUR LOCAL. STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND LOOK FORWARD TO ENSURING THAT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WITH THAT THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED.
