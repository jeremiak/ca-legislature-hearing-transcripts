REPORTS THAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:57:23.373 --> 00:57:24.340

THEM AND MOVING FORWARD. WE

00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:51.901
THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:53.069
THINK ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT IN

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:54.671
BIG WAYS THAT POSITIVELY IMPACT

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:57.540

MAKING THAT HE COULD GAUGE MAY

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:04.180
CONNECTION WITH FAMILIES. IT

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:06.449
ALSO TAKES A DEEP CULTURE SEX TO

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:07.717
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:09.953
PROGRAM. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE

00:58:10.019 --> 00:58:11.254
BIT THERE ABOUT THAT WORK

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:12.522
PARTICIPATION RIGHT.

00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.791
HISTORICALLY W. P. R. HAS BEEN

00:58:14.858 --> 00:58:16.593
THE SOLE FOCUS AT THE FEDERAL

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:19.429
LEVEL IN PARTICULAR AS THE ONLY

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:20.797
MEASURE AND THAT HAS BEEN A LONG

00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:22.532
TIME DRIVER OF POLICY AND

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:24.367
PRACTICE. THERE'S A REAL

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:25.535
RECOGNITION ACROSS THE ENTIRE

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:27.537
COUNTRY THE W. P. R. ISN'T THE

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:29.572
BEST MEASURE AND SHOULDN'T BE

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:30.907
THE ONLY MEASURE AND THIS IS A-

00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:34.377
BIPARTISAN. THAT THE KERN IT

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.479
JUST HAS NOT YET LED TO. THAT

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:37.747
THE LEVEL. BUT HERE IN

00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:38.481
CALIFORNIA WE'VE TAKEN THE

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:41.317
STEPS. MEANT TO POINT OUT TO-

00:58:41.384 --> 00:58:43.453
ENACTED NOW BEGIN GETTING BACK

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:45.355
TO IMPLEMENTING CAL OR WHAT

YOU'RE REALLY CLOSE THAT OUR

00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:49.158
EFFORTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS

00:58:49.225 --> 00:58:50.526
APPROACH FOR CALIFORNIA. OUT

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:52.061
DESPITE THE RECENT EFFORTS

00:58:52.128 --> 00:58:53.496

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:58.134
OPENING THAT THE HEARING TODAY.

00:58:58.201 --> 00:58:59.736
HAS REALLY SLOWED OUR EFFORTS

00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:06.109
AND REMAINS A BARRIER. TO

00:59:06.175 --> 00:59:08.177
FURTHER. HELLO OR IS AN EFFORT

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:10.079
TO MEASURE. TO TAKE A 36 DEGREES

00:59:10.146 --> 00:59:12.649
LOOK AT GIVEN A SET. WITH ARE

00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:14.083
FOR. ARE SOCIAL SIR CAR

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:15.785
THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY THE

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:17.720
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT WE

00:59:17.787 --> 00:59:20.023
SERVE WHO HAD EXPERIENCE OF THE

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:22.458
PROGRAM. LOOK AT MEASURES AND

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:24.460
DATA AND HOW WE'RE DOING ON

00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:25.395
MULTIPLE MEASURES AND THEN

00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:27.297
DEVELOP IMPROVEMENT PLANS. IT'S

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:29.132
THAT ARE CONTINUOUS QUALITY

00:59:29.198 --> 00:59:30.767
IMPROVEMENT APPROACH. MOVING

00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:32.969
AWAY FROM A PENALTY OR COME.

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:34.804
COMPLIANCE BASED APPROACH WITH

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:36.839
THE COUNTIES IN THE SAME WAY WE

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:38.007
ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THAT

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:40.143
PENALTY BASED. COMPLIANCE BASED

00:59:40.209 --> 00:59:42.145
APPROACH WITH OUR OWN CUSTOMERS

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:43.413
THAN THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE.

00:59:43.479 --> 00:59:44.881
BUT WHAT THE PENALTY IS HANGING

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:46.950
OUT THERE IT DIFFICULT IF NOT

00:59:47.016 --> 00:59:48.484
IMPOSSIBLE TO REALLY GO ALL IN

00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:50.386
ON THESE OTHER MEASURES AT THE

00:59:50.453 --> 00:59:52.322
COUNTY LEVEL. THOSE AND THESE

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:53.423
APPROACH THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:59:53.489 --> 00:59:55.458
ABOUT OUR LONG TERM NATURE WHY

00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:57.961
ARE. AND THE W. P. R. IS THE

00:59:58.027 --> 00:59:59.762
SHORT TERM WATER OFF KIND OF

00:59:59.829 --> 01:00:02.799
MEASURE. AND IT'S THE THING THAT

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:04.334
CAN GET THE COUNTY PENALIZED IT

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.003
CREATES A REAL CATCH TWENTY TWO.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.771
FOR COUNTIES FOR INDIVIDUAL

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.740
WORKERS FOR SUPERVISORS AND

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:17.747
CHIU REALLY DICHOTOMOUS THINGS

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:20.083
AT THE SAME TIME. SO WE CAN

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:22.318
THINK THE PENALTY PASSED THROUGH

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.020
LANGUAGE BEING A- WILL NOT MAKE

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:25.555
COUNTIES LEFT ACCOUNTABLE IN

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:27.924
FACT IT WILL HELP COUNTY SPEAK.

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:29.792
YOU KNOW WITH A UNIFIED VOICE

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.594
WITH OUR OTHER WITH OUR

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:34.364
CUSTOMERS WITH OUR STAFF AND BE

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.666
ABLE TO I THINK REALLY. AREN'T

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:39.836
EMBRACE TO POINT OUT HOW OR IN A

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:41.437
WAY THAT THEY'VE PERHAPS NOT

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:43.172
FULLY BEEN ABLE TO WIN THAT

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:50.213
LANGUAGES. OUT THERE. WAS ALSO

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:51.748
TO GIVE THE PERSON FROM POLICY

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.182
OF MINE REPORTED CERTAINLY HAVE

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:54.217
MORE ACCURATE. I'M SURE IT'S

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:56.552
ABOUT BUT- REALLY IT'S VERY

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:57.720
IMPORTANT THINK TO THE ABOUT-

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:59.655
SOME OF THE THAT. PIECES OF THAT

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:02.425
REPORT- HAVE REALLY ALSO BEEN

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.627
EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC-

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:07.063
IT'S IMPORTANT TO FACTOR THAT IN

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:07.997
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:10.266
SOLUTIONS SUCH AS THAT FOR

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.501
EXAMPLE- RE ENGAGEMENT OF OUR

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:13.903
CUSTOMERS WHO MADE FOR NOW. I

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:15.738
TWO YEARS NOT HAVE REALLY BEEN

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:17.840
ENGAGED EITHER OR WITH THE CAL

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:19.308
WORKS PROGRAM WITH THE WORK

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.344
FORCE OR WITH THE PROGRAMS AND

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:23.046
SERVICES THAT WE OFFER. BECAUSE

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:26.983
THOSE HAVE BEEN LOCKED DOWN

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:27.750
THEMSELVES. WHAT THESE ARE. IT'S

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.118
REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.087
WHAT IS GOING TO MOVE THE

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.355
PROGRAM CLOSER TO THAT VISION OF

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.290
TWO POINT NOW IN THE LONGER

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:35.658
TERM. AND WHAT IS GOING THE MOST

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:37.860
DIRECTLY HELP PROTECT. I DO WANT

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:39.996
TO ALSO COMMENDED THE DEPARTMENT

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:41.264
FOR THE APPROACH THAT TOOK I

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.332
MEAN YOU SEE A LOT IN THERE AND

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:45.234
THERE'S A LOT TO BE CONSIDERED.

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:47.970
THE APPROACH THAT'S NOTED THAT-

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.505
IN THE HEARING AGENDA OF HAVING

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:50.673
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.209
JUST THE WORK AROUND- KIND OF

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:55.178
WHAT SAID THAT REPORT AND WHAT

01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:56.846
NEXT STEPS MIGHT BE WITH A LOT

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.581
OF THAT BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE

01:01:58.648 --> 01:01:59.582
BIT AT- SEEMS LIKE A REALLY.

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:02.852
GOOD SET UP NEXT TO ME. IN A

01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:05.088
LONGER TERM I THINK- OF

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:06.789
SOMETHING WE'D ALSO EMPHASIZED

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.357
IS TO REALLY REMEMBER THAT

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:11.327
COUNTIES DO HAVE FLEXIBILITY.

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.161
BECAUSE OF THE TYPES OF

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:13.896
POPULATIONS WE SERVE THE

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:15.765
INDUSTRIES THAT MAYBE WITHIN THE

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.733
COUNTY OF THE NEEDS THAT ARE

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.535
PARTICULAR IN ATLANTIC COUNTY

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:21.671
AND SO ENABLING FLEXIBILITY TO

01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:24.107
CONTINUE. AND NOT HAVING IT BE A

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:26.175
ONE SIZE FITS ALL PROGRAM ACROSS

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:30.847
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IT'S.

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:32.415
IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN. AND THEN-

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:33.716
FINAL JUST THINKING ABOUT THE

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:35.451
INNER. BETWEEN CHILD WELFARE.

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:38.387
AND POVERTY CAL WERE. EVERYTHING

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:41.324
THAT I RECKON THANK YOU AS YOU

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.492
BOTH LOOK TOWARD POSSIBLE HERE

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:44.093
DURING THIS BUDGET AS WELL AS A

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.995
LONGER TERM CONVERSATION FOR US

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.297
ALL- WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:49.932
THERE'S INTERSECTION BETWEEN

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:52.235
POVERTY AND THE CHILD WELFARE

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:53.803
SYSTEM NOT THAT POVERTY CLASSES

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.505
OF HOUSTON THAT COLLECT BUT THAT

01:02:55.571 --> 01:02:56.873
POVERTY CAUSES SIGNIFICANT

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:59.041
STRESS ON FAMILIES. THAT CAN AT

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:01.978
TIMES BRING THEM TO THE

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:02.879
ATTENTION OF CHILD WELFARE. AT

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.181
TIMES BECAUSE OF ABUSE OR

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:06.082
NEGLECT THAT IS OCCURRING BUT

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:06.716
ALSO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED

01:03:06.782 --> 01:03:08.684
ABOUT THEM EVEN IF THERE'S NOT

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.853
SOMETHING GOING ON THAT'S RIGHT

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.221
INTO THAT LEVEL OF ABUSE OR

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:13.789
NEGLECT. FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:15.024
HELP STRENGTHEN FAMILIES SO THEY

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:17.093
NEVER BECOME TO THE ATTENTION OF

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.895
THE SYSTEM OR GET INTO THE

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.096
SYSTEM IS REALLY CRITICAL YOU

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:22.465

UNDERWAY BUT WERE LOOKING

THEM OUT OF THE CHILD WELFARE

SYSTEM BY NOT JUST PROVIDING-

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.468
I'D BE USED TO COLLECT BUT

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:01.837
PREVENTING EVEN THAT FIRST CALL.

01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:03.639
BECAUSE THAT'S THE PLAN WE WILL

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:04.574
BE STRONGER THE COMMUNITY WILL

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.910
HAVE SERVICES IN PLACE. M. THEN-

SIGNIFICANT CAL WORKS IN CHILD

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:19.989
WELFARE OVERLAP. BETWEEN THE TWO

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:23.059
PROGRAMS WE ARE LAST YEAR-

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.694

CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:35.238
INTO FOSTER CARE. THERE'S ALSO A

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:36.639
SIGNIFICANT EFFORT UNDER WAY TO

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.174
REALLY REVITALIZED AND REVAMPED

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:39.375
OUR LINKAGES PROJECT WILL

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:41.143
CALLING IT LIKE IT JUST TO POINT

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.012

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.880
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN OUR CAL

SYSTEMS. THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.026
OF DISCUSSIONS THE PAST HEARINGS

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:59.161

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:33.716
JUST PUSHING THEM INTO PAID

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:36.318
EMPLOYMENT. AND CALIFORNIA'S

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:38.421
CURRENT PLANNED TO PASS ANY

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:40.689
POTENTIAL PENALTY ONTO THE

01:07:40.756 --> 01:07:42.491
COUNTY'S. MAKES IT HARDER TO

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:43.793
WORK WITH FAMILIES WITH LOW

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:46.228
INCOMES AND TO OFFER THEM THE

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:48.230
SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. WE KNOW

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:49.732
THAT EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS ARE

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:52.134
TRAUMA INFORMED. RECOGNIZE A

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:53.702
FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES AND FOCUS

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:56.705
ON FAMILY STRENGTH. OVER THE

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.507
YEARS THE COMMERCE PROGRAM HAS

01:07:58.574 --> 01:07:59.842
RIGHTLY CHANGE TO BETTER REFLECT

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.877
THESE PRINCIPLES AND THAT WORK

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:03.779
SHOULD BE CONTINUED. STATE

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:05.114
LEADERS MUST COMMIT TO HELPING

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.249
PARENTS ADDRESS BARRIERS AND

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.118
THAT MEANS REMOVING OR REVISING

01:08:09.185 --> 01:08:11.120
THE PENALTY PASS ON SO THAT IT

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:12.621
NO LONGER DISCOURAGES FULLY

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:14.089
PROVIDING THE CRITICAL

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:15.991
COUNSELING AND EDUCATION

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:18.761
OPPORTUNITIES THAT PARENTS NEED

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:20.196
. WE KNOW THAT CARE HOWARD'S

01:08:20.262 --> 01:08:22.131
PARENTS FACE SIGNIFICANT

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:23.365
CHALLENGES AND ADVERSE

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.534
EXPERIENCES THAT NEGATIVELY

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:26.368
AFFECT THEIR EMPLOYMENT

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:29.038
PROSPECTS IN THEIR HEALTH. IT

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.372
ALMOST FOUR IN TEN CAL WORKS

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.541
CASES THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:34.777
DID NOT COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL.

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:37.346
ADDITIONALLY ON AVERAGE AT LEAST

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:39.949
31% OF CLIENTS EACH MONTH REPORT

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:42.184
HAVING MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:44.487
. I 20% I HAVE FACED DOMESTIC

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:47.490
ABUSE- AND 5% HAVE STRUGGLED

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:49.892
WITH SUBSTANCE USE AND THIS DATA

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.560
REFLECTS NATIONAL RESEARCH THAT

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.162
MOST TEN OF RECIPIENTS HAVE AT

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:56.198
LEAST ONE BEAR TO WORK AND MANY

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:57.666
HAVE MULTIPLE BARRIERS. AND ALSO

01:08:57.733 --> 01:08:59.034
THE LIKELIHOOD OF WORK TO

01:08:59.101 --> 01:09:01.504
CLIENTS AS THE NUMBER OF

01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:02.972
BARRIERS INCREASES. AND YET

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:05.274
COUNTER INTUITIVELY THE FEDERAL

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:06.642
KIND OF PROGRAM AND ITS

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.577
REQUIREMENTS FOR STATES FOCUSES

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:10.412
ONLY ON GETTING PARENTS INTO

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.381
JOBS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:14.783
NOT ON HELPINGTHEM ADDRESS

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.151
LONGER TERM BARRIERS TO WORK.

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:18.053
THIS SHORT SIGHTED WORK FIRST

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.256
MENTALITY IS REFLECTED IN THE

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:22.658
WORK PARTICIPATION RATE OR WPR-

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.159
AS OTHERS SPEAKERS HAVE ALREADY

01:09:24.226 --> 01:09:26.428
NOTED BEFORE ME. BUT I WANT TO

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.397
HIGHLIGHT TODAY IS THAT WPR IS

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:30.466
NOT JUST A FLAWED MEASURE BUT

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:32.067
THAT IT IS SPECIFICALLY- A

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:35.337
FEDERALLY DEFINED A NARROW SET

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.572
OF WELFARE TO WORK ACTIVITIES.

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:38.107
DESPITE THE RESEARCH THAT SHOWS

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:39.742
THAT PARENTS NEED BOTH

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:41.677
EMPLOYMENT FOCUSED ACTIVITIES

01:09:41.744 --> 01:09:42.945
AND OF THOSE SUPPORTING

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:45.014
EDUCATION AND TREATMENT. SUCH

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.550
SUPPORT OF ACTIVITIES DO NOT

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:50.319
FULLY COUNT TOWARDS THE WPR. IN

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:51.921
RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA POLICY

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:53.956
MAKERS HAVE TAKEN THE INITIATIVE

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.291
TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS WORK

01:09:55.357 --> 01:09:57.359
FORCED MODEL AND INSTEAD TO

01:09:57.426 --> 01:09:59.495
FOLLOW THE RESEARCH ON HOW TO

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:01.130
ADVANCE FAMILY WILL BEGINNING.

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:03.465
THESE STEPS INCLUDE SB TEN FORTY

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:05.467
ONE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHICH

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:06.602
CREATED NEW STATE STANDARDS

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:07.803
UNDER WHICH BARRIER REMOVAL

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.338
ACTIVITIES AND EDUCATION ARE

01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:11.373
ACTUALLY EQUAL TO WORK

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.175
ACTIVITIES. THOUGH IN THE SHORT

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:15.010
TERM CALIFORNIA COULD RISK A

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.712
PENALTY FOR NOT MEETING TARGET

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:18.547
WORK RATES. THESE MORE HOLISTIC

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:20.215
STANDARDS ARE BETTER FOR

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:21.951
FAMILIES AND COULD ACTUALLY HELP

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:24.453
INCREASE THE STATE'S WORK RATES

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.522
IN THE LONG TERM. UNFORTUNATELY

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:28.390
THE STATE'S LONGSTANDING POLICY-

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:30.192
TO MAKE COMPANIES PAY HALF OF

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:32.027
ANY POTENTIAL PENALTY HINDERS

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.296
THIS PROGRESS. THE CALIFORNIA

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:35.965
HAS NEVER ACTUALLY GET PAID UPON

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:38.100
A PENALTY THE PENALTY SHARING

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:39.268
PROVISION EFFECTIVELY

01:10:39.335 --> 01:10:41.136
DISCOURAGES COUNTIES FROM FULLY

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:42.471
IMPLEMENTING THE STATE'S OWN

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:44.740
POWERS REFORMS. AND HAS REAL ON

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:46.642
THE GROUND CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:49.478
FAMILIES. ARANDA VALUATION OF

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:51.680
THE RECENT- POLICY CHANGES HAVE

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:53.282
SHOWN THAT COUNTY CASE WORKERS

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:55.351
PERCEIVE AN INHERENT CONFLICT

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:57.219
BETWEEN HOLISTICALLY SUPPORTING

01:10:57.286 --> 01:10:59.388
PARENTS ON THE ONE HAND. AND

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:00.689
MEETING THE V. PR IN THE OTHER

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:02.191
BECAUSE CASE WORKERS CAN BE

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:03.792
PENALIZED WHEN THE PARENTS THEY

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:05.995
SUPPORT DO NOT MEET THESE TYPE

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:08.130
WORK AT THESE WORK TARGET. AS A

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:10.132
RESULT OF SOME CASE WORKERS

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:12.167
REPORTED ACTUALLY FEELING LIKE

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:13.569
WE NEEDED TO STEER CLIENTS AWAY

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.404
FROM ACTIVITIES LIKE TREATMENT

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:17.473
TREATMENT AND EDUCATION BECAUSE

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:20.809
THEY MAY NOT MEET W. P. R. THE

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:23.512
STATE CAN AND SHOULD MOVE ON

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:24.513
FROM THIS UNSUSTAINABLE STATUS

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:27.149
QUO. ONE OPTION IS TO REMOVE THE

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:28.884
PENALTY SHARING POLICY ENTIRELY

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.419
SO THAT CASE WORKERS CAN INSTEAD

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:32.287
FOCUS ON HELPING PARENTS REMOVE

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:34.923
BARRIERS TO WORK AND SUPPORTING

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:36.392
THEIR GOALS. ANOTHER OPTION

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:39.128
WOULD BE TO SHIELD COUNTIES FROM

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:39.962
POTENTIAL PENALTIES ARE PROVIDED

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:41.196
THEY WOULD HAVE MEANT WPR

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:42.931
TARGETS IF BARRIER REMOVAL

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:44.700
ACTIVITIES ACTUALLY FULLY

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:47.002
COUNTED AND CALCULATING THE WORK

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:48.971
RATE. BUT BEYOND REVISING THE W.

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:51.006
P. R. POLICY OF THE STATE SHOULD

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:52.741
FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING OUR

01:11:52.808 --> 01:11:55.544
OVERALL SO THAT FAX IS DEFINED

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:57.746
AS HELPING PARENTS MOVE. OUT OF

01:11:57.813 --> 01:12:00.215
POVERTY AND TOWARDS MEETING

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:01.917
THEIR PERSONAL GOALS. AT THE

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.752
STATE LEADERS SHOULD ALSO COMMIT

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:05.054
TO FULLY IMPLEMENTING COVERAGE

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.555
TWO POINT NOW AND CAL OR

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:08.857
ENSURING ROBUST GRANTS ABOVE.

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:10.559
THE POVERTY FOR ALL COLORS

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:13.162
FAMILIES AND FOCUS ON PURSUING

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:14.930
POLICIES TO IMPROVE THE LABOR

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.432
MARKET FOR PARENTS WITH LOW

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:18.167
INCOMES SO THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA

01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:20.135
CHILD AND FAMILY COULD THRIVE.

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:23.939

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:10.652
IS BECAUSE OF THAT CONNECTION

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:13.288
THAT CBS HAS ENGAGED WITH PARA

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:14.990
VOICES MEMBERS TO IDENTIFY

TO DETERMINE WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS

01:13:44.286 --> 01:13:45.487

HOME NAVIGATING THE CALIFORNIA

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:14.743
SYSTEM CAN BE CHALLENGING AND

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:16.078

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.220
REMARKS INTO A COUPLE OF AREAS

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.989
SOME OF WHICH YOU'VE HEARD A BIT

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:57.025
ABOUT BUT HOPEFULLY PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT-

01:19:57.092 --> 01:20:01.096
DIFFERENT- PERSPECTIVE ON THEM-

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:02.464
I THINK YOUR ANALYSIS DOES A

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:04.065
VERY GOOD JOB I THINK ABOUT LINE

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:06.501
SORT OF THE PATH THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:11.439
ON- YOU KNOW I THINK THERE WAS A

01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:13.275
REAL CONSENSUS AMONG- THE

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:15.377
COUNTIES THE ADVOCATES. OF

01:20:15.443 --> 01:20:18.380
LEGISLATORS THE DEPARTMENT- THAT

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:19.881
WE REALLY NEEDED TO TAKE A REAL

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:22.384
FRESH LOOK AT THE CAR WORKS

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:25.320
PROGRAM- I THINK- WE WILL WE'RE

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:27.289
LEARNING A LOT AND SEEN THAT THE

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:29.024
APPROACH THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:32.294
TAKING FOR MANY DECADES. NOT

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.196
ONLY WAS A COMPLIANCE ORIENTED

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:37.399
MODEL BUT I THINK IN MANY WAYS

01:20:37.465 --> 01:20:41.736
HAD SORT OF. PLATEAUED AND WAS

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:43.638
NO LONGER PROVIDING THE BENEFIT

01:20:43.705 --> 01:20:45.674
THAT WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT GET

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.976
SOME MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.277
FAMILIES REALLY WEREN'T ABLE TO

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:50.478
PARTICIPATE EFFECTIVELY IN THE

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:52.814
PROGRAM. AND WHILE THERE WAS A

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:54.649
PERCENTAGE OF THE FACT THE CASES

01:20:54.716 --> 01:20:55.850
THAT COULD MEET THE WORK

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:56.618
PARTICIPATION RATE AND ALL THE

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:57.686
COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS THE

01:20:57.752 --> 01:20:59.588
COUNTIES THAT WASN'T THE CASE

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:01.556
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:02.891
FAMILIES AND I THINK THAT

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:04.259
UNDERSTANDING REALLY KIND OF

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:06.828
DROVE THE DESIRE FOR BOTH- CAL

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:08.964
WORKS TWO POINT NO. AND

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.265
EVENTUALLY THE FORMATION OF

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:17.572
CALIFORNIA- AND- THE- YOU KNOW

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:19.708
THE- AS WE WENT THROUGH THAT

01:21:19.774 --> 01:21:21.509
PROCESS OF DISCOVERY AND I

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:24.646
THINK- I LEARNED MORE ABOUT IT I

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:27.148
THINK IT. IT BECAME APPARENT TO

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:30.819
US THAT- THE RULE OF THE RULES

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:33.088
OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF WERE A

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:35.056
MAJOR BARRIER TO WHAT WE'RE

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:37.425
TRYING TO ACHIEVE- WHEN WE WERE

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:40.228
DESIGNING CAL OR FOR EXAMPLE

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:41.396
THERE WERE SEVERAL MOMENTS

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:45.033
WHERE- WE REALIZE THAT WHAT WE

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.601
WANTED TO MEASURE SOMETHING WE

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:49.571
HAD A LAW THAT ACTUALLY MANDATED

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:52.340
THE OFFICES. AND SO THAT IT WAS

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.476
FROM THAT MOMENT I THINK THAT WE

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:56.344
BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT WE NEEDED

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:57.512
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THESE

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:58.546
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE NOW

01:21:58.613 --> 01:22:02.150
COME FORWARD TO YOU TODAY- AND I

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:07.789
THINK- THOSE. THE RECKON I THINK

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:09.791
ARE BEGINNING I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:11.559
THEY CAPTURE EVERYTHING THAT WE

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:14.062
NEED TO DO AND CAL WORKS- BUT I

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:17.165
DO THINK THAT THEY ARE A START-

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:20.035
BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO GO BACK I

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:21.903
THINK AND I. WILL CALL IT THIS

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:24.306
JUST FOR MAYBE TO BE A LITTLE

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:26.441
BIT COLORFUL- THE ORIGINAL SCENT

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:29.144
OF TANNA WHICH IS. THE WORK

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:30.779
PARTICIPATION RATE THAT WAS

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.681
IMPOSED ON COUNTIES COMBINED

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:34.215
WITH THE THIRTY HOUR WORK

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:35.116
REQUIREMENTS AND THE USE OF

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:38.153
SANCTIONS TO COMPLY. PEOPLE TO

01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:39.721
HAVE TO PERFORM THE DUTIES THAT

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:43.158
WERE ASSIGNED TO THEM- AND SO I

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:44.626
THINK WE'RE AT THIS REALLY

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:48.496
CRITICAL JUNCTURE WHERE WE

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:51.866
CONTINUE. TO LIVE UNDER THE

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:54.469
FEDERAL LAW AND CONTINUE TO PUSH

01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:56.771
COUNTY EMPLOYEES TO CONTINUE TO

01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:58.673
HOLD PEOPLE TO THAT STANDARD

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.575
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW. IT'S HARD

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:05.080
FOR MANY CASES. OR WE CAN CHOOSE

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:07.449
THE PATH OF BRAVERY WHICH IS TO

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:10.819
SAY WE'RE GOING TO REALLY FOLLOW

01:23:10.885 --> 01:23:12.253
CAL WORKS TWO POINT OH AND THE

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.289
CALOR MODELS AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:17.692
LEARNING IN OUR SESSIONS AND-

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:20.061
TAKE THE RISK. THAT THIS IS

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:21.996
WHAT'S BEST FOR FAMILIES AND

01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:25.133
KNOW THAT IN IF SOME FEDERAL

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.501
PENALTY WERE TO COME DOWN I

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:28.470
WOULD REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:30.038
NO STATE HAS EVER BEEN ASSESSED

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:32.273
A PENALTY ON ON THE ALL FAMILY

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:35.777
RATE ONLY ON THE TWO POUND. RATE

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:39.147
THAT THAT RISK IS WELL WORTH

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:45.520
TAKING. THAT OUR FAMILIES ARE

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:47.555
IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO US THAT WE

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:50.225
WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND WE

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:52.260
WOULD MOVE BEYOND THE CAL WORKS-

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:54.295
PENALTY FORMULA THAT WE HAVE IN

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:57.198
CURRENT LAW SO YOUR- YOUR

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:59.868
ANALYSIS- PUTS THE LAW RIGHT OUT

01:23:59.934 --> 01:24:01.669
THERE THINK IT'S ON PAGE

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:03.671
SEVENTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS THAT'S

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:06.040
WASN'T HALF A PAGE LONG- AND

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:07.041
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I REALLY

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:08.743
BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION NEEDS

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:11.246
TO TAKE A REALLY STRONG LOOK AT

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:12.514
IF WE WANT THIS PROGRAM TO A

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:15.483
BALL BEYOND WHERE IT IS BANNED

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:16.618
FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:19.254
DECADES WE NEED TO CHANGE THE

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:19.988
MOTIVATIONS THAT ARE DRIVING

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:21.723
COUNTIES AND CAO AND THE

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.725
WORKERS- THAT WE'VE WE'VE HELD

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:26.428
IN PLACE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:28.530
DECADES. SO AGAIN I WOULD JUST

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:32.500
REMIND THAT THE REASON THAT WE-

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:34.068
WE WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:35.837
I HAVE NOT YET ACKNOWLEDGED THE

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:39.507
GREAT WORK OF CDSS AND MISS MAY

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:41.676
CENTER STAFF THEY'VE BEEN A JOY

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.044
TO WORK WITH AND THEY'VE DONE AN

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:44.846
INCREDIBLE JOB AND WE GOT

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:45.613
INTERRUPTED BECAUSE COVE AND ALL

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.815
THAT BUT WE PICKED THE PIECES

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:49.250
BACK UP AND REPORTS NOW IN FRONT

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:50.785
OF YOU AND SO I DO WANT TO

01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:52.353
COMMEND THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.888
WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE. BUT THE

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:55.089
PURPOSE OF THIS THOUGH WAS TO

01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:59.360
IDENTIFY LEGAL BARRIERS TO

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:00.995
REFORMING CAL WORKS AT ALLOWING

01:25:01.062 --> 01:25:03.932
TWO POINT OO TO REALLY FUNCTION

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:04.732
THE WAY THAT WE BELIEVE IT CAME

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:06.901
OUT OF THE WAY THE SCIENCE TELLS

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:09.704
US THAT IT CAN AND SO I THINK AS

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:11.706
WE LOOK AT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:13.408
I WOULD REALLY DRAW YOUR

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:14.843
ATTENTION TO THOSE THINGS THAT

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:16.377
ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:22.150
THAT ARE LEGAL IN NATURE AND- SO

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:23.651
I THINK. YOU KNOW NUMBER ONE OUR

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.220
LIST IS CLEARLY THE TOWN OF

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:27.922
PENALTY PASS ON. AND REFORMING

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:29.257
THAT PROCESS I THINK WE'RE

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.292
REFORMING THAT SYSTEM TAKING

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:33.194
THAT BERRIER OFF OF COUNTIES IS

01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:35.096
THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WE

01:25:35.163 --> 01:25:35.763
NEED TO DO TO MAKE THIS SYSTEM

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:38.466
THIS PROGRAM WORK BETTER. AND

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:39.601
REALLY HELP FAMILIES GET OUT OF

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:42.170
POVERTY. NOW I THINK YOU

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:43.438
PROBABLY HEARD THAT FROM ALMOST

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:45.373
ALL OF US TODAY SO I THINK I

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.375
WON'T GO DOWN THAT PATH TO MUCH

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:49.310
FURTHER- BUT I DO WANT TO CALL

01:25:49.377 --> 01:25:51.112
OUT A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:52.881
IN THE REPORT- THAT. I THINK ARE

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:56.117
OF THE SAME NATURE- ONE IS THAT

01:25:56.184 --> 01:25:58.119
FOR MANY MANY YEARS. CALIFORNIA

01:25:58.186 --> 01:26:01.189
HAS HAD A VERY. LIMITED POLICY

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:03.291
OF PROVIDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:06.461
WAIVERS FROM WELFARE TO WORK-

01:26:06.528 --> 01:26:07.996
RIGHT NOW IT'S COUNTY OPTION

01:26:08.062 --> 01:26:10.231
ESSENTIALLY IF A FAMILY COMES IN

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:11.065
HAS A HISTORY OF DOMESTIC

01:26:11.132 --> 01:26:12.800
VIOLENCE THE COUNTY GETS THE

01:26:12.867 --> 01:26:14.302
DETERMINE SENSUALLY WHETHER OR

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:15.737
NOT THAT PERSON SHOULD

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:17.505
PARTICIPATE IN WELFARE TO WORK-

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:19.040
WE THINK THAT'S COMPLETELY

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:21.109
BACKWARDS WE THINK THAT THE

01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:22.610
OPTION REALLY OUGHT TO LIVE WITH

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:24.078
FAMILIES ABOUT THEIR WILLINGNESS

01:26:24.145 --> 01:26:25.179
AND THEIR READINESS TO BE ABLE

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:27.081
TO PARTICIPATE WE ALSO DON'T

01:26:27.148 --> 01:26:28.249
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WELLSTONE

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:30.184
AMENDMENT VERY WELL ON OUR STATE

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:31.886
WHICH COULD HELP OUR WORK

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:33.321
PARTICIPATION RATE BY THE WAY.

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:34.989
AND I'M SORRY DO A CHECKPOINT

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:36.724
WILSON AMENDMENT THE WASSERMAN

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:38.493
IS A PART OF THE TOWN OF LAW

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.229
THAT SAYS THAT IF I IF THE STATE

01:26:41.296 --> 01:26:42.430
DOES- PROVIDE A WAIVER FROM

01:26:42.497 --> 01:26:43.798
WELFARE T WORK TO DO

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:45.567
UNDOCUMENTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:46.834
THAT THAT CASE DURING THOSE

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:48.069
MONTHS DOESN'T COUNT AGAINST THE

01:26:48.136 --> 01:26:50.038
WORK STATION RIGHT SO WE DON'T

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:51.706
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT VERY WELL

01:26:51.773 --> 01:26:53.207
ARE LAW ACTUALLY KIND OF PUSHES

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:55.109
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO WE

01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:57.011
WOULD WE WOULD WE WOULD LIFT

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:58.246
THAT UP THAT'S SOMETHING VERY

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:00.014
IMPORTANT AND THIS THIS CONCEPT

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:02.183
IS CAPTURED IN A BILL- BY SIMPLY

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:05.186
MEMBER REYES AB TWENTY TWO

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:06.521
SEVENTY SEVEN RIGHT NOW A CO

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:07.889
SPONSOR BY WESTERN CENTER

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:08.556
ANOTHER ADVOCATES. AND SOMETHING

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:11.192
THAT WE REALLY THINK NEEDS TO BE

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:14.963
CHANGED SOON- I WILL PILE ON TO

01:27:15.029 --> 01:27:16.297
JENNIFER CRAPPIES COMMENT ABOUT

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:19.367
THE NAVIGATORS- WE THINK OF THE

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:21.402
MORE THAT WE CAN GET FORMER CAL

01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:23.738
WORKS RECIPIENTS TO HELP CURRENT

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:25.440
CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS WHO HAVE

01:27:25.506 --> 01:27:26.608
THAT KNOWLEDGE I HAVE THE

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:28.109
PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH MANY

01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:29.711
MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS

01:27:29.777 --> 01:27:31.045
WHO HAVE LEARNED THE SYSTEM BY

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:32.647
BEING IN TOWERS ALL THE YEARS

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:34.682
AND KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT WORK FOR

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:37.085
THEM AND I THINK IF WE WERE TO

01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:38.620
REACH INTO THE US GIVE THEM JOBS

01:27:38.686 --> 01:27:39.988
WITHIN THE COUNTIES HELP THEM.

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:41.589
GET THOSE JOBS FOR THEM SO THEY

01:27:41.656 --> 01:27:42.657
CAN HELP FAMILIES I THINK WOULD

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:44.692
REALLY ASSIST A LOT OF A LOT OF

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:46.894
PEOPLE- WE LIKE THE NAME CAL CAL

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:48.830
FAMILIES- WE'VE BEEN FUNNY THAT

01:27:48.896 --> 01:27:50.231
SHE SAID THAT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:51.666
CALLING IT CAL FAN FOR A WHILE

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.868
WE DON'T USE CAO WORKS MUCH MORE

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:55.903
IN OUR OFFICE AND THEN LASTLY-

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:57.305
THERE ARE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS IN

01:27:57.372 --> 01:27:58.840
THIS REPORT WHICH I THINK ALSO

01:27:58.906 --> 01:28:00.208
WERE SUBSTANTIVE IN NATURE WHICH

01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:01.776
REALLY ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:02.844
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FOR MANY

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:08.850
YEARS- ONE IS PEOPLE. DO NOT GET

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:10.585
THEIR SUPPORT SERVICES IS. AND

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:11.919
PER. TRANSPORTATION NOT YEARSWE

01:28:11.986 --> 01:28:13.755
DID. SOME GREAT WORK AND WE NOW

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:14.756
GET CHILD CARE SUBSIDIES TO

01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:15.723
PEOPLE WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:17.592
GET THEM. FOR THE FIRST TWELVE

01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:19.327
MONTHS THAT THEY'RE ON THE

01:28:19.394 --> 01:28:19.994
PROGRAM. AND WE ALL WORK

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:21.529
TOGETHER TO GET TO MAKE THAT

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:23.698
HAPPEN. NOW I THINK WE NEED TO

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:24.999
DO THE SAME FOR TRANSPORTATION.

01:28:25.066 --> 01:28:26.634
IF YOU IF A PERSON IS REQUIRED

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:28.169
TO PARTICIPATE IN WELFARE TO

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:28.803
WORK SERVICES. THEY SHOULD GET

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:30.538
AN ADDITIONAL SUM OF MONEY EVERY

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:33.207
MONTH ON THEIR- ON THEIR- EBT

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:34.942
CARD. SO THEY CAN USE TO PAY FOR

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:36.644
THEIR TRANSPORTATION COST. THE

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:38.179
IDEA OF HAVING. GREATER

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:39.814
BUREAUCRACY AND FORMS OF PEOPLE

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:41.749
HAVING TO FILL THEM OUT AND ALL

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:43.384
OF THAT THAT GOES ALONG WITH

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:44.819
THAT THAT COULD BE ANOTHER

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:45.853
OPTION. I THINK JUST A

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.855
STANDARDIZATION OF THIS APPROACH

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:49.490
WOULD BE THE PROPER WAY TO GO.

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:51.292
I'M NOT KNOWING THAT WE'RE HERE

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:53.294
FROM COUNCILS LATER ON IT MAY

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:54.929
TAKE A WHILE TO BUILD IMPLEMENT

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:57.131
THAT IN. FOR A YEAR TO. BUT I

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:58.900
THINK IF WE MADE THE DECISION

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:01.102
THIS YEAR. TO IMPLEMENT THAT AND

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.271
GOT THAT IN THE QUEUE. THEN IN A

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:06.307
COUPLE OF YEARS THAT POLICY

01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:06.908
WOULD TAKE EFFECT AND REALLY

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:08.743
HAVE A- MARKET EFFECT FOR FOLKS.

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:10.445
NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR

01:29:10.511 --> 01:29:11.079
TRANSPORTATION COSTS. AND THEN

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:12.980
LASTLY I THINK A NEW THING THAT

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:13.681
WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IN

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:15.016
TERMS OF SUPPORT SERVICES. YOU

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:17.018
KNOW YOU CAN'T REALLY DO YOUR

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:18.586
JOB YOU CAN'T. YOUR KIDS CAN'T

01:29:18.653 --> 01:29:19.954
STUDY VERY WELL UNLESS THEY HAVE

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:22.123
AN INNER INTERNET CONNECTION-

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:24.292
AND THIS REPORT ALSO CALLS OUT

01:29:24.358 --> 01:29:26.761
FOR. LIKE WE DO WITH DIAPERS-

01:29:26.828 --> 01:29:28.296
PROVIDING THAT- INTERNET

01:29:28.362 --> 01:29:29.397
CONNECTION SO THE FAMILIES

01:29:29.464 --> 01:29:30.865
ACTUALLY. HAVE THAT SERVICE

01:29:30.932 --> 01:29:32.567
AVAILABLE TO THEM THEY CAN

01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:34.168
ATTEND THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:35.169
COURSE THAT THEY KNEW TWO ONE.

01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:38.072
ONLINE AND DO A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:39.807
THINGS THAT REALLY FRANKLY IN

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:41.642
THIS MODERN SOCIETY. ARE REQUIRE

01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:44.112
INTERNET CONNECTION. OKAY LASTLY

01:29:44.178 --> 01:29:46.748
AND YOU ASKED. ABOUT WHAT OTHER

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:48.649
KIND OF THINGS WE CAN DO TO

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:50.785
SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES. YOU KNOW

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:53.688
YOU KNOW. WHAT'S GONNA COME OUT

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:54.789
OF MY MOUTH NEXT MISTER CHAIR. I

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:57.225
WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:59.293
MONEY- WE KNOW MONEY WORKS- YOU

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.329
KNOW AND IF WE GIVE PEOPLE MORE

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:03.197
MONEY THEY'RE GONNA STAY HOUSED.

01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:04.932
THEY'RE GOING TO THEIR KIDS ARE

01:30:04.999 --> 01:30:06.334
GONNA BE BETTER OFF- ALL SORTS

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.035
OF GOOD POSITIVE THINGS HAPPEN

01:30:08.102 --> 01:30:09.871
FOR MORE MONEY. BUT THERE ARE

01:30:09.937 --> 01:30:11.105
OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. AND

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.907
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:14.108
THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

01:30:14.175 --> 01:30:15.710
CONSIDER. HE IS TAKING A LOOK AT

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:16.744
SOME THINGS THAT WERE NOT

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:19.113
NECESSARILY INCLUDED WITHIN.

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:22.817
THE- THE- THE CURRENT REPORT

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:24.852
THAT THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU- FOR

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:27.121
EXAMPLE. WE REALLY DIDN'T GET TO

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:28.656
HAVE A REAL DEEP EXAMINATION OF

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:32.326
ELIGIBILITY- YOU KNOW WE KNOW WE

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:34.262
HAVE A LOW CASE LOAD NUMBER

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:36.063
RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK WE NEED

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:37.899
TO SPEND THE TIME TO. TO TAKE A

01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:39.767
LOOK AT THE WAY THAT THE

01:30:39.834 --> 01:30:40.535
APPLICATION PROCESS GOES. AND

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:42.403
ALL THE BEARS REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.970
ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE AND

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:45.173
EXAMINE THAT TO SEE IF WE CAN

01:30:45.239 --> 01:30:46.440
STRIP SOME OF THAT BACK. AND

01:30:46.507 --> 01:30:49.410
HELP FAMILIES GET ON AID MORE-

01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:50.745
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:52.480
SHOULD CONSIDER. I THINK ALSO WE

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:54.048
HAVE TO REDUCE THE USE OF

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:55.616
SANCTIONS IN THIS PROGRAM. ARE

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:57.518
AND THE SANCTIONS REALLY GO BACK

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:59.387
TO THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE WORK

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:00.121
PARTICIPATION RATE THE REASON

01:31:00.188 --> 01:31:00.955
THAT SANCTIONS ARE YOU SO

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:03.424
HEAVILY IN POWER. CALIFORNIA IS

01:31:03.491 --> 01:31:08.529
THAT THEY- ARE THE TOOL. FOR

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:09.831
MAKING PEOPLE COMPLY WHY WE

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:11.032
STRIPPED AWAY FROM. AS A EFFORT

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:13.835
TO. PEOPLE TO TRY TO DO WE WANT

01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:15.069
THEM TO DO. THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:16.504
APPROACH WE HAVE TO WORK WITH

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:17.638
PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE AT TO HELP

01:31:17.705 --> 01:31:19.707
THEM GET. THEM INTO A PLACE

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:20.975
WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO WILLINGLY

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:21.776
PARTICIPATE AND DO THE

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:23.077
ACTIVITIES. THAT THEY KNOW ARE

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:25.379
GOING TO BENEFIT THEM- AND THEN

01:31:25.446 --> 01:31:28.082
LASTLY- WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:29.951
HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT- THE

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:32.987
USE OF. WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER-

01:31:33.054 --> 01:31:34.789
OVER USE OF FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS

01:31:34.856 --> 01:31:38.526
WITHIN THE HOURS PROGRAM- THERE

01:31:38.593 --> 01:31:42.196
IS SORT OF THIS- NOT EVERY

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:44.065
COUNTY I WOULD NOT SAY THAT BUT

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:46.133
IN SOME COUNTIES WE ARE SEEN-

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.002
THE USE OF FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:50.738
AND- THIS CONSTANT KIND OF

01:31:50.805 --> 01:31:52.907
EXAMINING PEOPLE AND THEIR

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:56.110
FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES- HAS

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:57.278
REALLY THREATENING AND DRIVING

01:31:57.345 --> 01:32:00.181
PEOPLE- HERE OFTEN PEOPLE BEING

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:02.149
FORCED TO QUIT THE PROGRAM UNDER

01:32:02.216 --> 01:32:03.284
THE THREAT OF A LEGAL

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:06.420
PROSECUTION- THAT DOESN'T FEEL

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:08.489
RIGHT TO US AT ALL AND- IT'S

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:10.157
SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:11.259
LEGISLATURE REALLY NEEDS TO

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:12.493
EXAMINE AS WE GO FORWARD WITH

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.694

IDENTIFYING WAYS THAT WE CAN-

01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:06.407
MAKE SURE THAT THAT MEASURE. IS

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:07.875
AS APPROPRIATE AND ACCURATE AS

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:09.110
IT COULD WORKING WITH THE

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:11.412
DEPARTMENT ON THEIR EFFORTS AS

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:13.948
WELL. BUT THE OVERALL ESTIMATE

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:16.317
IS NOT A PARTICULARLY- HIGH TAKE

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:18.119
UP RATE WE THINK ABOUT SIXTY

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:20.454
PERCENT. ABOUT THREE OUT OF

01:34:20.521 --> 01:34:24.225

01:34:31.399 --> 01:34:32.900
YEAR IS GONE INTO THIS AND WE

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:35.936
ARE HOPING. IT WILL BEAR FRUIT

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:38.572
AND- IN THE FORM OF PUBLIC

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:40.808
PRODUCTS VERY SHORTLY. ARE THE

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.176
QUESTIONS OF WHY DO THOSE

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:43.911
REMAINING TWO FAMILIES NOT

01:34:43.978 --> 01:34:46.480
ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM- WHICH

01:34:46.547 --> 01:34:48.749
DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC GROUPS

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:51.419
ARE LEAST LIKELY TO ENROLL WHICH

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:54.955
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS SHALL-

01:34:55.022 --> 01:34:57.158
CONSISTENT PROPENSITY TO HAVE

01:34:57.224 --> 01:34:58.526
LOW TAKE UP RATES. AT THESE ARE

AND WE THINK THAT IT WILL INFORM

01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:11.939
A LOT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AND

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:13.874
ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO BETTER

01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:17.545
TARGET THEIR PRIORITIES FOR

01:35:17.611 --> 01:35:18.913

HOW WE'RE COUNTING THAT'S THAT'S

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:23.083
SOMETHING WE'VE HISTORICALLY

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:24.718

TO JUST SAY IS THAT- THE TEN OF

01:40:37.931 --> 01:40:40.167
PROGRAM LARGELY ALSO HAS NOT

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:41.201

FEDERAL LEVEL AND SOMETIMES I

01:40:42.603 --> 01:40:43.737

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:45.773

BROADLY SO I DO THINK THAT'S THE

01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:05.092
CONTINUED OPPORTUNITY WE SHOULD

01:41:05.159 --> 01:41:05.959
ALL LOOK TOWARDS. THAT'S

01:41:06.026 --> 01:41:10.063

FOR THOSE THIRTY NINE COUNTY IS-

02:04:27.259 --> 02:04:28.761
THAT THE DATE DATE WAS ACTUALLY

02:04:28.828 --> 02:04:30.863
FAIRLY CONSISTENT- FOR THOSE

MEDICAL RATE DID DECREASE FROM.

02:04:43.609 --> 02:04:46.846
1% 22% WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO

02:04:53.986 --> 02:04:55.588
DUE TO THE DIFFERING PROGRAM

02:04:55.654 --> 02:04:58.290

IN THE CALCIFIED IN THE

02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:34.960
CALIBRATION NUMBER. BUT SUSPECT

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:36.996
IT'S LIKELY DUE TO A COMBINATION

02:05:37.062 --> 02:05:38.964
OF INCREASES IN APPLICATIONS

02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:40.532
YEAR OVER YEAR APPLICATIONS

02:05:40.599 --> 02:05:43.135
INCREASED BY MORE THAN 15%

02:05:43.202 --> 02:05:45.137
DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND SOME

02:05:45.204 --> 02:05:46.972
ISSUES THAT C. W. D. A. HAS

02:05:47.039 --> 02:05:49.241
BROUGHT UP IN THE PAST THAT THE

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:51.744
METHODOLOGY FOR FUNDING CALFRESH

02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:53.679
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS IS A TWENTY

02:05:53.746 --> 02:05:55.281
YEAR OLD PROCESS THAT HAS NOT

02:05:55.347 --> 02:05:57.917
BEEN- LOOKED AT AND OVER TWENTY

02:05:57.983 --> 02:06:01.253
YEARS AND THERE'S- UNDER FUNDING

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:03.789
THAT'S TAKING PLACE ON THAT. WE

02:06:03.856 --> 02:06:06.725
ALSO THINK THAT THE IMPACT OF

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:09.228
THE OMICRON SURGE ON OUR COUNTY

02:06:09.295 --> 02:06:11.897
WORKFORCE HAD AN IMPACT. AND

02:06:11.964 --> 02:06:14.033
THAT WHEN WE REALLY LOOK AT THAT

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:16.101
YEAH ON- JANUARY OF TWENTY

02:06:16.168 --> 02:06:16.835
TWENTY TWO MAY HAVE BEEN A

02:06:16.902 --> 02:06:18.871
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO LOWERED

02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:21.273
LOWER NUMBERS AS WELL. NOW FOR

02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:23.309
MEDIC CAL. COUNTIES HAVE SOME

02:06:23.375 --> 02:06:25.511
FLEXIBILITY IN REGARDS TO

02:06:25.577 --> 02:06:27.313
APPLICATION PROCESSING TIME LINE

02:06:27.379 --> 02:06:28.881
SO THEY CAN WORK WITH CUSTOMERS

02:06:28.948 --> 02:06:31.283
WHO NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME-

02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:32.484
TO BE ABLE TO GET THE NECESSARY

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:33.852
INFORMATION IT REALLY IS A

02:06:33.919 --> 02:06:35.854
DIFFERENTIATED IN THE DATA. BUT

02:06:35.921 --> 02:06:36.956
IT LIKELY CONTRIBUTES TO

02:06:37.022 --> 02:06:38.857
GENERALLY THE LOWER RATE MEDIC

02:06:38.924 --> 02:06:41.560
CAL VERSES THE CALFRESH AND CAL

02:06:41.627 --> 02:06:44.296
WORKS PROGRAM. WE FOUND LITTLE

02:06:44.363 --> 02:06:46.999
CHANGE IN THE RATE OF

02:06:47.967 --> 02:06:50.269
RESCINDED- WITH CAL WORK STAY IN

02:06:50.336 --> 02:06:53.272
AT 8% CALIFORNIA'S GOING FROM 6%

02:06:53.339 --> 02:06:57.076
25% META CAL FROM 3% 24% SO IT'S

02:06:57.142 --> 02:06:58.410
IMPORTANT NO ONE WE'RE LOOKING

02:06:58.477 --> 02:07:00.112

THE OLD LEGACY SYSTEM TO CAL

02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:09.888

02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:50.995
LOOKING AT THAT. TWENTY YEAR OLD

02:32:51.061 --> 02:32:52.830

CBO'S AND A SISTER THAT'S PART

02:33:00.704 --> 02:33:02.973
OF THE BENEFITS ECOSYSTEM. SO

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:05.142
MAKING SURE THAT- AS WE'RE

02:33:05.209 --> 02:33:07.077
DEVELOPING BENEFITS CAL BUT IT'S

02:33:07.144 --> 02:33:08.579

THE ECOSYSTEM AND HOW THEY- THEY

02:33:11.315 --> 02:33:12.249

02:33:14.485 --> 02:33:16.353
THERE'S DATA THAT SHOWS THAT.

02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:17.922
CONSUMERS HAVE A 60% BETTER

02:33:17.988 --> 02:33:19.290
CHANCE OF GETTING BENEFITS IF

02:33:19.356 --> 02:33:20.658
THEY WORK WITH SOMEBODY AND A

02:33:20.724 --> 02:33:22.693
SISTER- AND WE KNOW THAT THE

02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:23.928
FOLKS WORKING WITH THE SISTERS

02:33:23.994 --> 02:33:25.629
ARE OFTEN PEOPLE OF THE HARDEST

02:33:25.696 --> 02:33:26.964
TIME ACCESSING BENEFITS ON THEIR

02:33:27.031 --> 02:33:28.766

02:33:28.832 --> 02:33:30.534
THEIR OWN THEY WOULD THEY GO TO

02:33:30.601 --> 02:33:32.269
A SISTER BECAUSE THEY NEED HELP-

02:33:32.336 --> 02:33:34.338

ALIGNMENT WITH THE LAW THAT'S

02:33:38.609 --> 02:33:40.144
REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT WE ALSO

02:33:40.210 --> 02:33:42.012
WANTED TO BE SET UP IN A WAY

02:33:42.079 --> 02:33:44.048
WHERE THE INFORMATION FLOW THE

02:33:44.114 --> 02:33:44.815
QUESTIONS THE WAY THEY'RE WORDED

02:33:44.882 --> 02:33:46.550
ALLOW CONSUMERS TO. BE IN

02:33:46.617 --> 02:33:48.652
ALIGNMENT WITH THE LOT AS WELL

02:33:48.719 --> 02:33:49.920
SO THEY DON'T GET CONFUSED AND

02:33:49.987 --> 02:33:51.488
ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS OR OR

02:33:51.555 --> 02:33:53.824
JUST GIVE UP AND THE NOT APPLIED

02:33:53.891 --> 02:33:56.760
APPLIED ALL- AND SO. HAVING A

02:33:56.827 --> 02:33:58.162
HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN APPROACHES

02:33:58.228 --> 02:33:59.129
I THINK IT'S BEEN VENTURED

02:33:59.196 --> 02:34:00.864
BEFORE AND THAT OFFENSE TAKEN

02:34:00.931 --> 02:34:03.367
AUTHENTIC ENGAGEMENT AS PART OF

02:34:03.434 --> 02:34:04.501
THE PROCESS. SO THOSE ARE A FEW

02:34:04.568 --> 02:34:06.403
OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE THINK

02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:07.905
WOULD BE REALLY GREAT FOR THE

02:34:07.972 --> 02:34:09.840

02:34:12.843 --> 02:34:16.847
ACTUALLY MODELING THAT PRACTICE-

02:34:16.914 --> 02:34:18.282
AND FOR MY SECOND QUESTION ABOUT

NEED TO DO- FOR SOME OF US THAT

02:34:56.887 --> 02:34:58.689
MEANS WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO

02:34:58.756 --> 02:35:00.624

02:40:24.414 --> 02:40:26.049
GETTING THE BETTER OUTCOMES. SO

02:40:26.116 --> 02:40:28.385
THAT WE CAN USE THAT TO EDUCATE

02:40:28.452 --> 02:40:30.387
TO TRYING TO COACH EACH OTHER. I

02:40:30.454 --> 02:40:31.955
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR THAT

02:40:32.022 --> 02:40:34.057
PEOPLE THINK THAT WE WANT TO USE

02:40:34.124 --> 02:40:36.560
THAT THE THAT. THAT DATA TO

02:40:36.626 --> 02:40:38.662
SHAME OR TO. I DON'T KNOW THOUGH

02:40:38.729 --> 02:40:39.830
KINDS OF. IMPLICATIONS TO THE

02:40:39.896 --> 02:40:40.764
COMPETITION THAT IS NOT THE

02:40:40.831 --> 02:40:42.599
CULTURE AND THE VALUES THAT WE

02:40:42.666 --> 02:40:44.434
BRING INTO THIS WORK. NO ONE

02:40:44.501 --> 02:40:45.502
WINS FROM SHAMING AND BLAMING

02:40:45.569 --> 02:40:46.603
EACH OTHER THERE'S PLENTY OF

02:40:46.670 --> 02:40:47.804
THAT GOING ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:40:47.871 --> 02:40:49.706
TO DO IS LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER

02:40:49.773 --> 02:40:51.842
SO THAT WE CAN AMPLIFY AND BUILD

02:40:51.908 --> 02:40:53.377
ON THE ASSETS. TO THE WORK AND

02:40:53.443 --> 02:40:54.578
THE CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE. AND

02:40:54.644 --> 02:40:56.747
THE LAST THING TO SHARE WITH YOU

02:40:56.813 --> 02:40:58.115
GUYS I THINK OFTENTIMES WE

02:40:58.181 --> 02:40:59.549
FORGET THREE KEY THINGS WHEN IT

02:40:59.616 --> 02:41:01.451
COMES TO THE COLLEGE DURING OUR

02:41:01.518 --> 02:41:02.052
CONVERSATION SPECIFICALLY. WE

02:41:02.119 --> 02:41:03.353
THINK THAT THE COLLEGE WORK IS

02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:05.055
JUST ABOUT COLLEGE STUDENTS. I'M

02:41:05.122 --> 02:41:06.289
A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE

02:41:06.356 --> 02:41:08.091
STUDENT I NEED FINANCIAL AID TO

02:41:08.158 --> 02:41:09.593
GO TO COLLEGE I KNOW THAT

02:41:09.659 --> 02:41:10.894
THROUGH MY YEARS IN COLLEGE. I

02:41:10.961 --> 02:41:13.096
WAS STILL TRANSLATING A LOT OF

02:41:13.163 --> 02:41:14.998
WORK FOR FAMILIES BACK HOME FROM

02:41:15.065 --> 02:41:16.767
MY OWN FAMILY FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

02:41:16.833 --> 02:41:18.568
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS

02:41:18.635 --> 02:41:19.770
OUT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS IS

02:41:19.836 --> 02:41:21.638
BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO BE THE

02:41:21.705 --> 02:41:22.639
PRIMARY SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR

02:41:22.706 --> 02:41:23.907
THEIR FAMILIES. WE'RE NOT JUST

02:41:23.974 --> 02:41:24.975
THINKING ABOUT IMPROVING THE

02:41:25.042 --> 02:41:26.877
TOOL FOR THE COLLEGE STUDENT THE

02:41:26.943 --> 02:41:28.345
COALITION IS PROBABLY SUPPORTING

02:41:28.412 --> 02:41:29.746
THE PARENTS THE SIBLINGS THE

02:41:29.813 --> 02:41:31.581
WHOEVER IS POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE

02:41:31.648 --> 02:41:33.216
FOR SOCIAL SERVICES. THROUGH

02:41:33.283 --> 02:41:34.818
THEIR TIMING COLLEGE RATHER THAN

02:41:34.885 --> 02:41:36.520
JUST FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT. SO

02:41:36.586 --> 02:41:37.921
THINKING ABOUT COLLEGE STUDENTS

02:41:37.988 --> 02:41:39.423
AS CROSS POLLINATORS AND AS THE

02:41:39.489 --> 02:41:41.258
MULTIPLYING EFFECT IS ESSENTIAL

02:41:41.324 --> 02:41:42.926
FOR US TO LIFT IN THE

02:41:42.993 --> 02:41:43.794
CONVERSATION. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:45.862
WE USE THIS HIERARCHY OF HUMAN

02:41:45.929 --> 02:41:47.431
VALUE AND PEOPLE THINK THAT

02:41:47.497 --> 02:41:48.832
WE'RE TRYING TO PUT COLLEGE

02:41:48.899 --> 02:41:50.067
STUDENTS OVER EVERYONE ELSE. AND

02:41:50.133 --> 02:41:51.101
THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE WE'RE

02:41:51.168 --> 02:41:52.769
TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY

02:41:52.836 --> 02:41:53.637
ESPECIALLY FIRST GENERATION

02:41:53.703 --> 02:41:55.605
COLLEGE STUDENTS I KNOW THAT I

02:41:55.672 --> 02:41:56.773
COME FROM THE IMPERIAL VALLEY.

02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:57.741
FOLKS FROM THE IMPERIAL VALLEY

02:41:57.808 --> 02:42:00.343
DON'T GO TO THE UC AND VOLUMES

02:42:00.410 --> 02:42:01.611
WE DON'T GO TO THE CSU AND

02:42:01.678 --> 02:42:03.747
VOLUMES WE MAKE IT INTO THE

02:42:03.814 --> 02:42:05.348
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND FROM THERE

02:42:05.415 --> 02:42:06.783
HOPEFULLY WE MAKE IT INTO A FOUR

02:42:06.850 --> 02:42:08.552
YEAR. SO THAT KIND OF LIKE

02:42:08.618 --> 02:42:09.886
HIERARCHY OF HUMAN VALUE MAKES

02:42:09.953 --> 02:42:11.855
NO SENSE CULTURALLY ORRIN REACT

02:42:11.922 --> 02:42:13.423
AND THE REAL IMPLICATIONS.

02:42:13.490 --> 02:42:15.358
SECOND TO LAST THING IS. EVERY

02:42:15.425 --> 02:42:16.993
SINGLE STUDY THAT HAS HAPPENED

02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:18.929
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS

02:42:18.995 --> 02:42:20.197
CONFIRMED. THAT THE METRICS OF

02:42:20.263 --> 02:42:21.932
SUCCESS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION THE

02:42:21.998 --> 02:42:23.834
CALIFORNIA CARES ABOUT. ACCESS

02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:25.469
AFFORDABILITY RETENTION

02:42:25.535 --> 02:42:26.837
PERSISTENCE PERFORMANCE AND

02:42:26.903 --> 02:42:29.706
COMPLETION ARE ALL AND RIGHT

02:42:29.773 --> 02:42:31.408
RELATIONSHIP WITH BASIC NEEDS.

02:42:31.475 --> 02:42:33.009
IF WE'RE NOT MEETING THE BASIC

02:42:33.076 --> 02:42:36.246
NEEDS OF STUDENTS NONE OF THOSE

02:42:36.313 --> 02:42:38.014
METRICS SAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION

02:42:38.081 --> 02:42:38.782
. THAT OUR STATE LEADERSHIP AND

02:42:38.849 --> 02:42:40.617
ALEJO AND THE REST OF THE

02:42:40.684 --> 02:42:42.219
COMMUNITY OF ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:42:42.285 --> 02:42:43.854
HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE TO CAN BE

02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:45.455
MET. WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS THAT

02:42:45.522 --> 02:42:46.556
HAVE THEIR BASIC NEEDS MET

02:42:46.623 --> 02:42:48.959
PERFORMED AT MUCH BETTER AND

02:42:49.025 --> 02:42:51.027
HIGHER RATES AND OUTCOMES IN ALL

02:42:51.094 --> 02:42:52.696
OF THOSE METRICS AS A SUCCESS.

02:42:52.762 --> 02:42:54.631
AND THE LAST THING AND I THINK

02:42:54.698 --> 02:42:55.765
WHAT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL. IS

02:42:55.832 --> 02:42:57.000
TO UNDERSTAND THAT OFTENTIMES

02:42:57.067 --> 02:42:58.635
WHEN WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS

02:42:58.702 --> 02:43:00.770
WE IMMEDIATELY THINK ABOUT COST.

02:43:00.837 --> 02:43:02.339
AND THE RETURN OF INVESTMENT AND

02:43:02.405 --> 02:43:04.174
WE THINK ABOUT THE COST IN REAL

02:43:04.241 --> 02:43:06.109
TIME BUT WE DON'T THINK ABOUT

02:43:06.176 --> 02:43:06.977
HOW. WHAT'S THE RETURN ON

02:43:07.043 --> 02:43:08.745
INVESTMENT AND THINKING ABOUT.

02:43:08.812 --> 02:43:10.180
THE CAPACITY OF STUDENTS BEING

02:43:10.247 --> 02:43:11.281
ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE AND

02:43:11.348 --> 02:43:12.649
GENERATIVE WAYS THIS IS DATA

02:43:12.716 --> 02:43:14.184
THAT WE GOT FROM CDSS AND FROM

02:43:14.251 --> 02:43:17.621
C. SACK. FOR THE AMOUNT OF ZERO.

02:43:17.687 --> 02:43:20.290
EFC STUDENTS THE LOWEST INCOME

02:43:20.357 --> 02:43:22.159
STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF

02:43:22.225 --> 02:43:24.828
CALIFORNIA. TWO HUNDRED AND

02:43:24.895 --> 02:43:26.463
EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED

02:43:26.530 --> 02:43:27.564
AND EIGHTY EIGHT STUDENTS IN THE

02:43:27.631 --> 02:43:28.598
YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY

02:43:28.665 --> 02:43:30.567
ONE. WE HAD JUST AND ROLLED 50%

02:43:30.634 --> 02:43:33.803
OF THEM. NOT EVEN AT THE MAXIMUM

02:43:33.870 --> 02:43:34.437
OF CALIPHATE'S LET'S SAY AROUND

02:43:34.504 --> 02:43:35.739
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT WOULD

02:43:35.805 --> 02:43:37.440
HAVE BEEN FEDERAL DOLLAR VALUE

02:43:37.507 --> 02:43:40.677
OF FOURTEEN POINT THREE MILLION

02:43:40.744 --> 02:43:42.512
DOLLARS A MONTH. EIGHTY FIVE

02:43:42.579 --> 02:43:44.381
MILLION DOLLARS IN SIX MONTHS

02:43:44.447 --> 02:43:46.249
AND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE

02:43:46.316 --> 02:43:47.150
MILLION DOLLARS IN TWELVE

02:43:47.217 --> 02:43:49.619
MONTHS. JUST DOING IT FOR THAT

02:43:49.686 --> 02:43:50.987
SMALL PORTION OF THE COLLEGE

WORKING CLASS STUDENTS. THE

02:43:56.660 --> 02:43:57.861
INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR

US TO BUILD OUT THIS DATA

02:43:58.828 --> 02:44:00.430
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PUBLIC

BIT FURTHER ABOUT SOME OF THE

02:48:52.021 --> 02:48:53.423
THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT

02:48:53.490 --> 02:48:54.924
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED PLANNING

02:48:54.991 --> 02:48:57.427
FOR CALIFORNIA ASIAN- IT'S A

02:48:57.494 --> 02:48:58.962
PLANNING EFFORT THAT'S FIVE

02:48:59.028 --> 02:49:00.663
YEARS IN THE MAKING WITH FIRST

02:49:00.730 --> 02:49:02.332
STARTED PLANNING AND TWENTY

02:49:02.398 --> 02:49:03.533
SEVENTEEN. AND ACCOUNTED TOP

02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:04.868
PRIORITY AT THAT TIME WAS TO

02:49:04.934 --> 02:49:06.102
MAKE SURE THAT THE TRANSITION

02:49:06.169 --> 02:49:08.037
WILL BE A SMOOTH. AND SEAMLESS

02:49:08.104 --> 02:49:10.139
AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AS

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:11.774
WELL AS FOR OUR WORKERS IT

02:49:11.841 --> 02:49:13.776
REALLY NEEDS TO BE AS SIMPLE AS

02:49:13.843 --> 02:49:15.178
POSSIBLE ON BOTH ENDS. TO MAKE

02:49:15.245 --> 02:49:17.647
SOMETHING SIMPLER FOR- OF FRONT

02:49:17.714 --> 02:49:19.782
END USER CUSTOMER WHOSE SELF

02:49:19.849 --> 02:49:21.751
SERVING BUT THAT IT IS EXTREMELY

02:49:21.818 --> 02:49:23.386
COMPLICATED OF THE BACK AND FOR

02:49:23.453 --> 02:49:25.154
HER ELIGIBILITY STAFF. IT

02:49:25.221 --> 02:49:26.523
DOESN'T ACTUALLY HELP ANYBODY

02:49:26.589 --> 02:49:28.124
AND IT STILL CONTINUES THE

02:49:28.191 --> 02:49:33.396
POTENTIAL FOR DELAYS OR ERRORS.

02:49:33.463 --> 02:49:34.197
ONE MORE SERVING CUSTOMERS. SO

02:49:34.264 --> 02:49:35.665

02:49:35.732 --> 02:49:37.734
PRICE TO BUILD AND IF THE- BUT

THE TRANSITION PARTICULARLY FOR

THE CALVIN COUNTIES. KNOWING

02:49:39.802 --> 02:49:40.937
THAT THEY FACE A BIGGER

02:49:41.004 --> 02:49:41.971
CHALLENGE MOVING FROM THEIR

02:49:42.038 --> 02:49:43.573
CURRENT SYSTEM TO CALIFON. THAN

02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:46.409

BOTH THE SUBSEQUENT COUNTIES IN

02:49:56.085 --> 02:49:57.220
THE PROJECT TO BENEFIT FROM

02:49:57.287 --> 02:50:00.490
LESSONS LEARNED IN THE PRIOR

02:50:00.557 --> 02:50:01.524
WAIT. WHAT WE DIDN'T AND

02:50:01.591 --> 02:50:02.859
COULDN'T HAVE PLANNED FOR WHAT

02:50:02.926 --> 02:50:04.928
OF LOCAL PANDEMIC THAT LASTED

02:50:04.994 --> 02:50:06.629
FOR TWO YEARS AND TECHNICALLY IS

02:50:06.696 --> 02:50:07.897
STILL ONGOING THOUGH OF COURSE

02:50:07.964 --> 02:50:09.499
IN A MUCH BETTER SITUATION THAN

02:50:09.566 --> 02:50:13.503
WE HAPPEN. LOCALLY AND BECAUSE

02:50:13.570 --> 02:50:14.637
WORK THE PROJECT DOES YOUR MAY

02:50:14.704 --> 02:50:16.539
NOT SCHEDULE AND BOTH THE COUNTY

02:50:16.606 --> 02:50:18.074

02:50:18.141 --> 02:50:19.342
IMPLEMENT NUMEROUS POLICY

02:50:19.409 --> 02:50:21.544
CHANGES AT THE SAME TIME. BOTH

02:50:21.611 --> 02:50:22.679
TEMPORARY CHANGES THAT WERE

02:50:22.745 --> 02:50:24.514
RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC AND

02:50:24.581 --> 02:50:28.051
PERMANENT DUE TO CHANGING STATE

02:50:28.117 --> 02:50:29.919
AND FEDERAL POLICIES. THERE ARE

02:50:29.986 --> 02:50:30.753
MANY MORE POLICY CHANGES EVERY

02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:32.555
YEAR BEING DISCUSSED UP AS WELL

02:50:32.622 --> 02:50:34.657
AS THIS YEAR BOTH IN THE BUDGET

02:50:34.724 --> 02:50:35.858
AND LEGISLATIVE SESSION. AND WE

02:50:35.925 --> 02:50:37.393
REALLY ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT

02:50:37.460 --> 02:50:39.862
MANY OF THESE WE PUT A FEW FOR

02:50:39.929 --> 02:50:41.531
HERSELF. BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE

02:50:41.598 --> 02:50:42.832
SURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE THE

02:50:42.899 --> 02:50:44.434
ORIGINAL FOCUS OF TRYING TO MAKE

02:50:44.500 --> 02:50:45.935
THIS. VERY BIG TRANSITION FROM

02:50:46.002 --> 02:50:48.137
CAL WENT TO CAL FIVE AS SMOOTH

02:50:48.204 --> 02:50:50.640
AS POSSIBLE FOR THE 40% OF OUR

02:50:50.707 --> 02:50:52.575
STATE. IT'S GOING TO BE MAKING

02:50:52.642 --> 02:50:55.645
THE SWITCH BETWEEN OCTOBER OF.

02:50:55.712 --> 02:50:57.046

THAT ARE FEASIBLE FOR ABOUT THE

02:51:07.123 --> 02:51:08.758
COUNTY SAN CALIFORNIA'S TO MEET.

02:51:08.825 --> 02:51:10.793

THE COMMENTS BY MR BLAIR

REGARDING THE SIGNIFICANT

02:51:13.396 --> 02:51:14.764
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND IT

02:51:14.831 --> 02:51:16.432
HELPS US DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF

02:51:16.499 --> 02:51:17.900
ROLLOUT. AT THE LEVEL OF

02:51:17.967 --> 02:51:19.535
ENGAGEMENT I DON'T RECALL SEEING

02:51:19.602 --> 02:51:22.138
IN MY FEW DECADES THE C. W. D.

02:51:22.205 --> 02:51:22.805
A. WITH OTHER EFFORTS. NOT THAT

02:51:22.872 --> 02:51:24.307
THERE WASN'T ENGAGEMENT BUT THAT

02:51:24.374 --> 02:51:26.109
THIS ENGAGEMENT IS SO MUCH MORE

02:51:26.175 --> 02:51:27.610
ROBUST AND PUBLIC BASED THING

02:51:27.677 --> 02:51:29.912
THAT HAPPENS IN RIOR PROJECTS

02:51:29.979 --> 02:51:31.714
THAT I AM PARTICIPATED IN OR

02:51:31.781 --> 02:51:33.983
OBSERVED. OF IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

02:51:34.050 --> 02:51:35.852
THAT PROCESS REALLY SPEAKS TO

02:51:35.918 --> 02:51:37.086
STRIKE THAT APPROPRIATE BALANCE

02:51:37.153 --> 02:51:38.755
BETWEEN THE NEED FOR A

02:51:38.821 --> 02:51:40.657
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AS WELL

02:51:40.723 --> 02:51:41.858
AS THE ABILITY TO KEEP OUR

02:51:41.924 --> 02:51:43.993
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. RUNNING

SMOOTHLY AND WORKING WITH.

02:51:45.595 --> 02:51:46.996
COUNTY STAFF THAT INDIVIDUAL

02:51:47.063 --> 02:51:48.831
COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO KEEP

02:51:48.898 --> 02:51:50.767
THINGS MOVING AND DEVELOPED-

02:51:50.833 --> 02:51:52.535
WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

02:51:52.602 --> 02:51:54.003
ANY QUESTIONS AS WE GET TO THAT

02:51:54.070 --> 02:51:55.838
POINT AND THAT IN THE HEARING

02:51:55.905 --> 02:51:56.906
THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE

02:51:56.973 --> 02:52:03.012
WILL. HEAR FROM BRIAN METZGER

02:52:03.079 --> 02:52:05.381
WITH THE L. L. GOOD AFTERNOON-

02:52:05.448 --> 02:52:07.216
CARL WAS ASKED TODAY TO SOME

02:52:07.283 --> 02:52:08.785
HIGH LEVEL ISSUES QUESTIONS

02:52:08.851 --> 02:52:11.287
OBSERVATIONS- ABOUT ALL THE

02:52:11.354 --> 02:52:11.854
DIFFERENT TOPICS WE'VE HEARD

02:52:11.921 --> 02:52:15.425
TODAY SO- I'LL KEEP TO ABOUT

02:52:15.491 --> 02:52:16.526
FIVE OBSERVATIONS THAT WE HAVE

02:52:16.592 --> 02:52:18.461
FOR YOU TODAY IT'S A LOT BUT

02:52:18.528 --> 02:52:19.562
HOPEFULLY WE GET THROUGH THEM

02:52:19.629 --> 02:52:22.865
QUICKLY- THE FIRST OF WHICH IS-

02:52:22.932 --> 02:52:24.400
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT SEVERAL IT

02:52:24.467 --> 02:52:26.636
PROJECTS TODAY AND WE FIND IT IS

02:52:26.703 --> 02:52:28.838
CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

02:52:28.905 --> 02:52:30.306
BASELINE COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE

02:52:30.373 --> 02:52:33.176
OF THESE PROJECTS ARE- BROADLY

02:52:33.242 --> 02:52:34.844
THE STATUS TRANSITION TO MORE

02:52:34.911 --> 02:52:37.547
INTERACTIVES INCREMENTAL KIND OF

02:52:37.613 --> 02:52:38.781
DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:52:38.848 --> 02:52:40.583
PROJECTS AND THAT'S SLOWLY BEING

02:52:40.650 --> 02:52:42.685
REFLECTED IN THE WAY THAT THE

02:52:42.752 --> 02:52:43.219
STATE ADMINISTERS ITS IT

02:52:43.286 --> 02:52:45.288
PROJECTS. HOWEVER SOME PROJECTS

02:52:45.354 --> 02:52:46.923
HAVE STRUGGLED TO SET THEIR

02:52:46.989 --> 02:52:48.224
BASELINE COST AND SCHEDULE AND

02:52:48.291 --> 02:52:49.625
SCOPE BECAUSE THE APPROACH

02:52:49.692 --> 02:52:50.793
INTRODUCES ADDITIONAL

02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:52.995
FLEXIBILITY AND DOES NOT HAVE

02:52:53.062 --> 02:52:55.331
COMMENSURATE CHANGES AND

02:52:55.398 --> 02:52:56.599
OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL. FOR

02:52:56.666 --> 02:52:59.368
EXAMPLE WITH CWS CARES- WE FIND

02:52:59.435 --> 02:53:00.903
THAT SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY

02:53:00.970 --> 02:53:01.804
THAT WERE AFFORDED TO THIS

02:53:01.871 --> 02:53:03.272
PROJECT REDUCE THE LEGISLATURE'S

02:53:03.339 --> 02:53:05.007
OVERSIGHT. ONE PARTICULAR

02:53:05.074 --> 02:53:06.843
EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE ALLOWANCE

02:53:06.909 --> 02:53:08.611
OF ANNUAL SPECIAL PROJECT

02:53:08.678 --> 02:53:10.413
REPORTS WHICH ALLOW FOR MORE

02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:12.448
FREQUENT UPDATING OF KIND OF THE

02:53:12.515 --> 02:53:14.617
BASELINE COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE

02:53:14.684 --> 02:53:16.385
FOR THE PROJECT. ALSO THERE WERE

02:53:16.452 --> 02:53:17.887
ISSUES AROUND THE COST

02:53:17.954 --> 02:53:20.189
ESTIMATION FOR THIS PROJECT-

02:53:20.256 --> 02:53:21.758
WHEN S. P. R. FOR WAS APPROVED

02:53:21.824 --> 02:53:23.593
FOR THIS PROJECT THERE WAS A

02:53:23.659 --> 02:53:26.028
CONDITION. THAT THE PROJECT A

02:53:26.095 --> 02:53:28.231
CHOIR OF COST ESTIMATION EXPERT

02:53:28.297 --> 02:53:29.432
TO MORE PRECISELY ESTIMATE THE

02:53:29.499 --> 02:53:32.001
COST OF THE PROJECT AND TO OUR

02:53:32.068 --> 02:53:33.770
KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS NOT COMPLETED

02:53:33.836 --> 02:53:36.773
. SO IT IN SUMMARY WE REALLY

02:53:36.839 --> 02:53:40.910
EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO. FOCUS ON

02:53:40.977 --> 02:53:43.079
FIXING THE COST SCHEDULE AND

02:53:43.146 --> 02:53:44.380
SCOPE OF THE PROJECT SUCH THAT

02:53:44.447 --> 02:53:45.815
THE LEGISLATURE CAN OVERSEE

02:53:45.882 --> 02:53:47.316
WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES

02:53:47.383 --> 02:53:49.085
AND WHAT THOSE CHANGES TRULY

02:53:49.152 --> 02:53:52.388
REPRESENTED. SECONDLY WE WOULD

02:53:52.455 --> 02:53:53.589
LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE

02:53:53.656 --> 02:53:55.725
SEEING PROJECTS WITH METRICS TO

02:53:55.792 --> 02:53:57.827
MEASURE COMPLETION AND OUTCOMES

02:53:57.894 --> 02:53:58.795
. WHICH WE FIND TO BE A GOOD

02:53:58.861 --> 02:54:01.030
DEVELOPMENT- WE DO SEE FOR

02:54:01.097 --> 02:54:02.665
EXAMPLE WITH CWS CARES THE USE

02:54:02.732 --> 02:54:04.634
OF MILESTONES AND OTHER MEASURES

02:54:04.700 --> 02:54:06.235
TO MEASURE COMPLETION. AND THE

02:54:06.302 --> 02:54:07.336
USE OF KEY PERFORMANCE

02:54:07.403 --> 02:54:08.771
INDICATORS TO KIND OF MONITOR

02:54:08.838 --> 02:54:10.406
THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROJECT

02:54:10.473 --> 02:54:11.974
WE FIND THESE ARE HELPFUL BUT

02:54:12.041 --> 02:54:13.042
THEY HAVE TO BE FAIRLY

02:54:13.109 --> 02:54:14.410
CONSISTENT IN THEIR APPLICATION

02:54:14.477 --> 02:54:15.812
ACROSS THE LIFECYCLE OF A

02:54:15.878 --> 02:54:17.613
PROJECT TO BE USEFUL AND THEY

02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:20.249
NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE

02:54:20.316 --> 02:54:21.751
LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS. TO

02:54:21.818 --> 02:54:22.885
MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THE

02:54:22.952 --> 02:54:24.787
PROJECT AND SO THE LEGISLATURE

02:54:24.854 --> 02:54:26.589
IF THOSE TWO THINGS ARE MATT CAN

02:54:26.656 --> 02:54:28.758
USE THEM AS A MECHANISM FOR

02:54:28.825 --> 02:54:30.126
MAKING SURE THAT THE FUNDING WE

02:54:30.193 --> 02:54:32.161
APPROVE IS TIED TO THE ACTUAL

02:54:32.228 --> 02:54:34.197
COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT AND

02:54:34.263 --> 02:54:35.665
THE OUTCOMES THAT WE GET. OUT OF

02:54:35.731 --> 02:54:37.066
THEM. AGAIN WITH THE ABSENCE OF

02:54:37.133 --> 02:54:39.068
A CLEAR BASS LINE FOR CWS CARES

02:54:39.135 --> 02:54:41.070
THOUGH IT MAKES IT MUCH MORE

02:54:41.137 --> 02:54:42.205
DIFFICULT FOR THAT OVERSIGHT TO

02:54:42.271 --> 02:54:44.774
HAPPEN. A FEW OTHER OBSERVATIONS

02:54:44.841 --> 02:54:45.908
AND THESE ARE JUST GENERAL

02:54:45.975 --> 02:54:47.510
OBSERVATIONS TO KEEP IN MIND YOU

02:54:47.577 --> 02:54:49.145
AGAIN HEARD A LOT ABOUT

02:54:49.212 --> 02:54:50.179
DIFFERENT IT PROJECTS AND

02:54:50.246 --> 02:54:52.448
SYSTEMS. I THINK IT PROJECTS AND

02:54:52.515 --> 02:54:54.617
SYSTEMS SHOULD BE PLAN DEVELOPED

02:54:54.684 --> 02:54:55.518
AND IMPLEMENTED AND I THINK

02:54:55.585 --> 02:54:56.652
THERE'S BROAD AGREEMENT WITH

02:54:56.719 --> 02:54:58.588
CONSIDERATION OF HOW THE

02:54:58.654 --> 02:55:00.656
INTERFACE WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND

02:55:00.723 --> 02:55:01.858
ALSO OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:55:01.924 --> 02:55:03.726
INTEGRATION BETWEEN THEM I THINK

02:55:03.793 --> 02:55:05.461
THERE HAVE BEEN OPPORTUNITIES

02:55:05.528 --> 02:55:06.128
THAT ABOUT HIGHLIGHTED HERE

02:55:06.195 --> 02:55:07.997
TODAY BETWEEN. YOU KNOW EXISTING

02:55:08.064 --> 02:55:09.799
SYSTEMS AND SAY THE STATE

02:55:09.866 --> 02:55:11.634
VERIFICATION HUB YOU KNOW I

02:55:11.701 --> 02:55:13.269
THINK THAT THOSE ARE ALL- IN

02:55:13.336 --> 02:55:14.804
SERVICE OF TRYING TO MAKE IT

02:55:14.871 --> 02:55:16.272
EASIER FOR BENEFICIARIES TO

02:55:16.339 --> 02:55:18.307
ACCESS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES.

02:55:18.374 --> 02:55:19.775
HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO

02:55:19.842 --> 02:55:21.477
BE MADE AWARE OF HOW ALL OF

02:55:21.544 --> 02:55:23.112
THESE I. T. PROJECTS SYSTEMS

02:55:23.179 --> 02:55:25.414
WORK TOGETHER- IN THE ABSENCE OF

02:55:25.481 --> 02:55:28.251
CLEAR. YOU KNOW- INFORMATION

02:55:28.317 --> 02:55:30.286
IT'S PRESENTED IN A VERY USER

02:55:30.353 --> 02:55:31.654
FRIENDLY WAY TO MAKE US

02:55:31.721 --> 02:55:33.189
UNDERSTAND HOW ALL OF THESE

02:55:33.256 --> 02:55:34.857
DIFFERENT PROJECTS ARE ALIGNED.

02:55:34.924 --> 02:55:36.692
AND THE TIMELINE FOR EACH OF

02:55:36.759 --> 02:55:39.495
THEM I THINK IT MAKES IT HARDER

02:55:39.562 --> 02:55:40.129
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE.

02:55:40.196 --> 02:55:42.632
SITE OUR FOURTH OBSERVATION IS

02:55:42.698 --> 02:55:44.333
AGAIN NOT EVERY I. T. PROJECT

02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:46.235
AND SYSTEM IS OF THE SAME AGE

02:55:46.302 --> 02:55:48.137
AND CRITICALITY. TO THESE

02:55:48.204 --> 02:55:49.672
PROGRAMS WE HAVE SYSTEMS THAT

02:55:49.739 --> 02:55:51.874
ARE VERY OLD AND HAVE HAD

02:55:51.941 --> 02:55:53.376
DISRUPTIONS BECAUSE OF JUST THE

02:55:53.442 --> 02:55:55.378
AGE OF THE SYSTEM ITSELF. WE

02:55:55.444 --> 02:55:56.479
KNOW THAT THEIR EFFORTS THAT ARE

02:55:56.545 --> 02:55:58.247
BEING LED BY DEPARTMENT OF

02:55:58.314 --> 02:55:59.181
TECHNOLOGY GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS

02:55:59.248 --> 02:56:00.850
AGENCY TO LOOK AT STATE

02:56:00.917 --> 02:56:02.818
GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS AS A WHOLE.

02:56:02.885 --> 02:56:03.953
TO UNDERSTAND WHICH ONES ARE

02:56:04.020 --> 02:56:05.488
MOST AT RISK OF DISRUPTION AND

02:56:05.554 --> 02:56:06.756
OR FAILURE. WE THINK

02:56:06.822 --> 02:56:08.257
UNDERSTANDING THE AGENT

02:56:08.324 --> 02:56:09.592
CRITICALITY OF THESE PROJECTS

02:56:09.659 --> 02:56:10.793
AND SYSTEMS WITH INTELLIGENT

02:56:10.860 --> 02:56:12.528
CHEST. PARTICULAR DEPARTMENTS

02:56:12.595 --> 02:56:14.764
WITH THE UNDER THAT AGENCY IS

02:56:14.830 --> 02:56:15.765
CRUCIAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:56:15.831 --> 02:56:17.967
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW BEST.

02:56:18.034 --> 02:56:19.835
TO INVEST PROJECT AND SYSTEM

02:56:19.902 --> 02:56:22.071
RESOURCES. AND FINALLY WE'VE

02:56:22.138 --> 02:56:23.072
HEARD A LOT ABOUT STAKEHOLDER

02:56:23.139 --> 02:56:25.074
ENGAGEMENT. OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:56:25.141 --> 02:56:26.242
STAKEHOLDERS AND USERS TO

02:56:26.309 --> 02:56:27.710
PARTICIPATE IN THESE IT PROJECTS

02:56:27.777 --> 02:56:29.578
AND SYSTEMS. WE THINK THAT MAKES

02:56:29.645 --> 02:56:30.813
SENSE GIVEN PERSON CENTER

02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:32.748
PROGRAMS AND USER CENTERED

02:56:32.815 --> 02:56:34.183
DESIGN BECOMING CRITICAL TO

02:56:34.250 --> 02:56:36.886
THESE IT PROJECTS. BUT WE THINK

02:56:36.953 --> 02:56:38.721
THAT THERE COULD BE SOME YOU

02:56:38.788 --> 02:56:40.289
KNOW. BETTER ORGANIZATION OF THE

02:56:40.356 --> 02:56:41.924
INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND

02:56:41.991 --> 02:56:44.260
USERS TO ACTUALLY INFORM IT

02:56:44.327 --> 02:56:46.095
PROJECTS AND SYSTEMS WE'VE SEEN

02:56:46.162 --> 02:56:47.530
THIS MOST RECENTLY WITH THE CAL

02:56:47.596 --> 02:56:49.231
HERE'S DASHBOARD THAT WAS PUT

02:56:49.298 --> 02:56:51.968
TOGETHER FOR- FUNCTIONALITIES IN

02:56:52.034 --> 02:56:53.970
THE KALHOR SYSTEM. THAT COUNTY

02:56:54.036 --> 02:56:55.504
ELIGIBILITY WORKERS REALLY

02:56:55.571 --> 02:56:56.906
WANTED TO SEE PUT INTO THAT

02:56:56.973 --> 02:56:58.908
SYSTEM AND THAT PROCESS OF

02:56:58.975 --> 02:56:59.642
ESTABLISHING A DASHBOARD AND

02:56:59.709 --> 02:57:01.344
HAVING ROUTINE MEETINGS WITH.

02:57:01.410 --> 02:57:02.812
PROJECT STEERING COMMITTEE

02:57:02.878 --> 02:57:04.780
REALLY ALLOWED FOR

02:57:04.847 --> 02:57:06.315
PRIORITIZATION AND KIND OF

02:57:06.382 --> 02:57:07.350
IMPLEMENTATION OF DIFFERENT

02:57:07.416 --> 02:57:08.784
FUNCTIONALITIES THAT WERE NOT

02:57:08.851 --> 02:57:12.321
BEING YOU KNOW. PUT INTO PLACE A

02:57:12.388 --> 02:57:13.889
AND A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME

02:57:13.956 --> 02:57:15.157
. SO GET ARE KIND OF

02:57:15.224 --> 02:57:17.159
RECOMMENDATIONS REALLY ARE.

02:57:17.226 --> 02:57:19.395
AROUND ONE WITH CWS CARES THAT'S

02:57:19.462 --> 02:57:20.796
DOUBLE CHECK THAT BASS LINE

02:57:20.863 --> 02:57:22.732
MAKING SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND

02:57:22.798 --> 02:57:23.566
WHAT THE TRUE COST OF THIS

02:57:23.632 --> 02:57:25.468
PROJECT IS THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN

02:57:25.534 --> 02:57:27.737
UNDERWAY FOR MANY YEARS AND WE

02:57:27.803 --> 02:57:30.072
TRULY DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:57:30.139 --> 02:57:31.607
IT COSTS WHAT THE SCHEDULE IS

02:57:31.674 --> 02:57:33.476
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET FOR

02:57:33.542 --> 02:57:35.745
ALL OF THAT MONEY AND TIME. WE

02:57:35.811 --> 02:57:36.812
ARE STILL WAITING YOU KNOW

02:57:36.879 --> 02:57:37.680
SPECIAL PRODUCT REPORT FIVE AND

02:57:37.747 --> 02:57:40.049
WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE FUNDING

02:57:40.116 --> 02:57:40.916
REQUEST FOR THE LEGISLATURE. I'M

02:57:40.983 --> 02:57:42.885
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A

02:57:42.952 --> 02:57:43.652
ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT- AND AGAIN WE

02:57:43.719 --> 02:57:45.421
THINK THE FIRST KIND OF SET OF

02:57:45.488 --> 02:57:47.156
METRICS IS A GOOD START. BUT WE

02:57:47.223 --> 02:57:48.624
REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THE

02:57:48.691 --> 02:57:49.525
LEGISLATURE UNDERSTANDS AND

02:57:49.592 --> 02:57:50.793
AGREES WITH THE METRICS THAT ARE

02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:53.329
USED. TO MONITOR THESE PROJECTS.

02:57:53.396 --> 02:57:54.764
SECOND I THINK IT WOULD BE

02:57:54.830 --> 02:57:56.298
BENEFICIAL FOR SOME OTHER

02:57:56.365 --> 02:57:58.167
PROJECTS TO POTENTIALLY CONSIDER

02:57:58.234 --> 02:58:00.503
THE USE. OF SOMETHING LIKE A

02:58:00.569 --> 02:58:01.837
DASHBOARD SOME MECHANISM FOR

02:58:01.904 --> 02:58:02.605
GATHERING THE INPUT OF STATE

02:58:02.671 --> 02:58:05.241
COAL THERE'S AND OTHER USERS OF

02:58:05.307 --> 02:58:06.108
A SYSTEM. SUCH THAT THEY CAN

02:58:06.175 --> 02:58:07.910
PRIORITIZE FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES

02:58:07.977 --> 02:58:09.712
ARE THINGS THAT CAN REALLY. KIND

02:58:09.779 --> 02:58:11.580
OF BE MADE AND THE CHANGES THAT

02:58:11.647 --> 02:58:14.450
WE MADE IN THE SYSTEM- ONCE FOR

02:58:14.517 --> 02:58:15.751
EXAMPLE THE MIGRATION HAS

02:58:15.818 --> 02:58:17.053
ALREADY HAPPENED A CAL SAUCER TO

02:58:17.119 --> 02:58:18.587
BENEFITS CAL. SOMETHING THAT

02:58:18.654 --> 02:58:20.723
BETTER ORGANIZES THE INPUT FROM

02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:22.458
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE

02:58:22.525 --> 02:58:23.025
PARTICIPATING. AND THIRD WE

02:58:23.092 --> 02:58:24.527
THINK IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR

02:58:24.593 --> 02:58:25.661
THE SUB COMMITTEE TO HEAR MORE

02:58:25.728 --> 02:58:27.229
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:58:27.296 --> 02:58:28.364
TECHNOLOGY AND THE GOVERNMENT

02:58:28.431 --> 02:58:29.465
OPERATIONS AGENCY. ABOUT HOW

02:58:29.532 --> 02:58:30.733
IT'S CONDUCTING THIS KIND OF

02:58:30.800 --> 02:58:32.668
STATE GOVERNMENT LEVEL.

02:58:32.735 --> 02:58:34.170
ASSESSMENT OF WHICH SYSTEMS

02:58:34.236 --> 02:58:36.739
TRULY ARE AT RISK. WHICH

02:58:36.806 --> 02:58:38.207
PROJECTS REALLY NEED TO BE

02:58:38.274 --> 02:58:40.109
PRIORITIZE. WE CAN AVOID

02:58:40.176 --> 02:58:41.911
DISRUPTIONS SERVICE. AND WITH

02:58:41.977 --> 02:58:44.713
THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

02:58:44.780 --> 02:58:45.815
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL

- BEING FULLY TRANSPARENT THAT A

03:04:57.686 --> 03:05:00.422
PROJECT THAT HAS HAD MULTIPLE

03:05:00.489 --> 03:05:03.492
DELAYS AND ISSUES IS APPARENTLY

03:05:03.559 --> 03:05:05.828
HAVING THAT AGAIN AND SO WOULD

03:05:05.894 --> 03:05:07.663

THERE BUT WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT

03:05:26.915 --> 03:05:28.650
I HOPE YOU CAN EVALUATE WHAT

03:05:28.717 --> 03:05:30.652
MANY OF THE PRIMARY COST DRIVERS

03:05:30.719 --> 03:05:34.990
ARE. AND WHY WE ARE SO HIGH IN

03:05:35.057 --> 03:05:37.292
TOTAL FOR DOLLARS AND C. W. S.

03:05:37.359 --> 03:05:39.561
CARES THUS FAR I BELIEVE IT'S AN

03:05:39.628 --> 03:05:41.497
IMPORTANT QUESTION AND PROCESS

03:05:41.563 --> 03:05:43.465
FOR US TO UNDERSTAND AS WERE

03:05:43.532 --> 03:05:46.401
LOOKING AT OTHER- CHANGES WITHIN

03:05:46.468 --> 03:05:50.973
I. T. SYSTEMS. BUT ULTIMATELY

03:05:51.039 --> 03:05:52.875
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF I

03:05:52.941 --> 03:05:53.942
CAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT HO THIS

03:05:54.009 --> 03:05:55.210
WILL ACHIEVE BETTER CASE

03:05:55.277 --> 03:05:57.012
MANAGEMENT THROUGH C. W. S.

03:05:57.079 --> 03:05:59.248
CARES. AS WE CURRENTLY ONLY HAVE

03:05:59.314 --> 03:06:02.784
RFA IN THAT. MODULE HOW WILL

03:06:02.851 --> 03:06:04.253
THIS ULTIMATELY LEAD TOWARDS

03:06:04.319 --> 03:06:05.854
BETTER CASE MANAGEMENT WHICH IS

03:06:05.921 --> 03:06:10.392
THE ULTIMATE GOAL. I WILL

03:06:10.459 --> 03:06:11.960
STARTED OF JESSICA WANTS TO ADD

03:06:12.027 --> 03:06:13.862
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE-

03:06:13.929 --> 03:06:15.464
BUSINESS ARKAY IS PART OF OUR

03:06:15.531 --> 03:06:18.500
DEMONSTRATION MARSHALL- ONE OF

03:06:18.567 --> 03:06:20.936
THE SEGMENTS AS- WHILE WE'RE

03:06:21.003 --> 03:06:22.671
DEVELOPING THIS FUNCTIONALITY BY

03:06:22.738 --> 03:06:24.373
FUNCTIONALITY IT'S A SINGLE

03:06:24.439 --> 03:06:27.609
IMPLEMENTATION. THAT IS PLANNED

03:06:27.676 --> 03:06:29.011
TO BE COMPLETED IN MAY OF TWENTY

03:06:29.077 --> 03:06:33.949
TWENTY FOUR. CURRENTLY- SO. IT'S

03:06:34.016 --> 03:06:36.251
BUILDING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM TO

03:06:36.318 --> 03:06:39.755
REPLACE THE WCM **** DOES THAT

03:06:39.821 --> 03:06:43.425
ASSESSED IN THE TIMING OF WHEN

03:06:43.492 --> 03:06:45.360
THE CASE MANAGEMENT. WOULD BE

03:06:45.427 --> 03:06:48.463
PROCESSED SYSTEM WIDE I HEAR IT

03:06:48.530 --> 03:06:51.233
BUT THE CONFIDENCE WE HAVE TO

03:06:51.300 --> 03:06:54.803
DELIVER ON THAT IS- PREDICATED

03:06:54.870 --> 03:06:56.638
ON FOLLOWING MANY OF THE METRICS

03:06:56.705 --> 03:06:58.707
THAT WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE

03:06:58.774 --> 03:07:00.609
THAT ARE BEFORE US AND US. WITH

03:07:00.676 --> 03:07:01.743
THE HISTORY WE HAVE WITH THE

03:07:01.810 --> 03:07:04.780
PROGRAM WE REALLY ARE LOOKING

03:07:04.846 --> 03:07:06.248
FOR ANOTHER LEVEL OF DETAIL

03:07:06.315 --> 03:07:08.116
WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE THE

03:07:08.183 --> 03:07:10.352
LEGISLATURE INSISTED ON THE

03:07:10.419 --> 03:07:12.721
ACQUIRING OF A COST ESTIMATE AS

03:07:12.788 --> 03:07:14.156
WE WERE NOT HAVING A FULL

03:07:14.222 --> 03:07:16.258
UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE COST

03:07:16.325 --> 03:07:18.226
AND SCHEDULE OF THIS TRANSITION

03:07:18.293 --> 03:07:20.495
AND- REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE

03:07:20.562 --> 03:07:21.797
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THE

03:07:21.863 --> 03:07:24.833
ABILITY TO HAVE THAT CLARITY ON

03:07:24.900 --> 03:07:26.401
THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM- I. WOULD

03:07:26.468 --> 03:07:28.770
LIKE TO BRING IN THE L. L. IF I

03:07:28.837 --> 03:07:30.739
CAN FOR SURE. RYAN METZGER LA-

03:07:30.806 --> 03:07:31.974
JUST TO CLARIFY I BELIEVE THE

03:07:32.040 --> 03:07:33.542
EXPENDITURES ON THE PROJECT THUS

03:07:33.609 --> 03:07:36.111
FAR HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT IN

03:07:36.178 --> 03:07:37.412
EXCESS OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION

03:07:37.479 --> 03:07:39.881
DOLLARS- AND THE- SET OF

03:07:39.948 --> 03:07:41.316
FUNCTIONALITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

03:07:41.383 --> 03:07:43.619
MADE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROJECT-

03:07:43.685 --> 03:07:45.520
ARE NOT JUST RFA APPLICATION AND

03:07:45.587 --> 03:07:47.322
THERE ARE SOME FUNCTIONALITIES-

03:07:47.389 --> 03:07:49.558
RELATED TO KANSAS- THAT'S CALLED

03:07:49.625 --> 03:07:50.692
KERR SLIDE BUT STILL BEING

03:07:50.759 --> 03:07:51.827
SUPPORTED FOR SOME COUNTY SO

03:07:51.893 --> 03:07:54.096
THERE IS. MORE THAT IS-

03:07:54.162 --> 03:07:56.498
AVAILABLE- HOWEVER YOU ARE

03:07:56.565 --> 03:07:58.734
CORRECT THAT- THE LEGISLATURE

03:07:58.800 --> 03:08:00.669
HAS BEEN CONCERNED OVER TIME

03:08:00.736 --> 03:08:03.238
ABOUT KIND OF THE- THE COST

03:08:03.305 --> 03:08:05.307
CONTROLS GO FOR THIS PROJECT-

03:08:05.374 --> 03:08:07.542
AND IT IS CLEAR TO FROM THE

03:08:07.609 --> 03:08:08.510
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES

03:08:08.577 --> 03:08:10.679
APPROVAL OF THIS PROJECT. THAT

03:08:10.746 --> 03:08:11.980
THEY WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT

03:08:12.047 --> 03:08:13.148
THE COST ESTIMATION THAT WAS

03:08:13.215 --> 03:08:14.850
DONE AND REQUIRED IT IS PART OF

03:08:14.916 --> 03:08:16.018
THE LAST PROJECT APPROVAL

03:08:16.084 --> 03:08:18.987
DOCUMENTATION APPROVAL. LETTER

03:08:19.054 --> 03:08:20.889
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT

03:08:20.956 --> 03:08:23.125
HAS NOT BEEN DONE WE WOULD JUST.

03:08:23.191 --> 03:08:23.725
REALLY EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR

03:08:23.792 --> 03:08:25.927
THAT- AND THE NEED FOR CLEAR

03:08:25.994 --> 03:08:27.696
METRICS AGAIN WE UNDERSTAND THAT

03:08:27.763 --> 03:08:29.264
THERE ARE METRICS FOR COMPLETION

03:08:29.331 --> 03:08:30.399
LIKE MILESTONES THAT WILL GIVE

03:08:30.465 --> 03:08:31.767
US A SENSE OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY

03:08:31.833 --> 03:08:33.268
BEEN DEVELOPED. FROM THERE ARE

03:08:33.335 --> 03:08:34.770
METRICS FOR OUTCOMES AND FOR

03:08:34.836 --> 03:08:36.271
PERFORMANCE LIKE KEY PERFORMANCE

03:08:36.338 --> 03:08:37.773
INDICATORS IT WOULD BE VERY

03:08:37.839 --> 03:08:39.574
HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE I

03:08:39.641 --> 03:08:41.510
BELIEVE AND- OUR OFFICE WOULD

03:08:41.576 --> 03:08:42.377
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THESE

03:08:42.444 --> 03:08:44.446
METRICS BE MADE VERY CLEAR TO

03:08:44.513 --> 03:08:45.947
THE LEGISLATURE AND POWER

03:08:46.014 --> 03:08:47.983
MONITORING THEM OVER TIME. AND

03:08:48.050 --> 03:08:51.520
IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT IT'S VERY

03:08:51.586 --> 03:08:53.055
DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT.

03:08:53.121 --> 03:08:53.989
WITHOUT A LOOK FORWARD THE

03:08:54.056 --> 03:08:56.024
FOLLOW UP ON THIS TRANSITION AYE

03:08:56.091 --> 03:08:57.993
I WILL MOVE TO MR CONNEL THIS

03:08:58.060 --> 03:09:00.128
COMMENT ON. CALFRESH WITHIN OUR

03:09:00.195 --> 03:09:01.930
HIGHER EDUCATION POPULATION I

03:09:01.997 --> 03:09:04.332
WILL JUST POINT OUT MY OFFICES

03:09:04.399 --> 03:09:06.068
IN BALLSTON WORKING TO MAKE

03:09:06.134 --> 03:09:08.036
EXPANSIONS. WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU

03:09:08.103 --> 03:09:10.105
TO LOOK AT AB TWENTY EIGHT TEN

03:09:10.172 --> 03:09:11.907
AND THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX THAT WE

03:09:11.973 --> 03:09:13.842
DID LAST YEAR. THAT ARE LOOKING

03:09:13.909 --> 03:09:15.210
TO ACTUALLY TAKE THE FINANCIAL

03:09:15.277 --> 03:09:17.646
INFORMATION THAT WE KNOW. ABOUT

03:09:17.713 --> 03:09:19.047
HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS AND

03:09:19.114 --> 03:09:21.083
THEN FIGURING OUT IF THEY-

03:09:21.149 --> 03:09:22.984
QUALIFY FOR MANY OF THE

03:09:23.051 --> 03:09:24.086
PROGRAMS. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE

03:09:24.152 --> 03:09:26.722
THAT SAME LOGIC IF I CAN TO RYAN

03:09:26.788 --> 03:09:28.390
GILLETTE. AS WE ARE TALKING

03:09:28.457 --> 03:09:29.858
ABOUT THE STATE VERIFICATION

03:09:29.925 --> 03:09:32.661
HUB. AND CALFRESH CAL WORKS IN

03:09:32.728 --> 03:09:35.497
MEDICAL AND CHILD CARE PROGRAMS.

03:09:35.564 --> 03:09:37.399
YOU SAID IT WAS TO HELP TO

03:09:37.466 --> 03:09:38.533
STREAMLINE ELIGIBILITY

03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:41.369
REQUIREMENTS. BUT DO WE CHECK

03:09:41.436 --> 03:09:44.673
WHILE WE ARE VERIFYING THEIR-

03:09:44.740 --> 03:09:46.875
INCOME IF THEY QUALIFY FOR OTHER

03:09:46.942 --> 03:09:49.244
PROGRAMS DO WE FOLLOW IT UP

03:09:49.311 --> 03:09:53.515
WITH. SENDING DOCUMENTS TO THOSE

03:09:53.582 --> 03:09:55.751
PEOPLE WHO WE ARE BASED IN THESE

03:09:55.817 --> 03:09:58.520
PROGRAMS ON- ARE WE SIMILARLY

03:09:58.587 --> 03:10:00.422
FOCUSED ON ENSURING WE ARE

03:10:00.489 --> 03:10:02.958
PROVIDING AS MUCH ENGAGEMENT AND

03:10:03.024 --> 03:10:06.228
OUTREACH AS WE CAN. SO IT'S A

03:10:06.294 --> 03:10:08.764
GREAT QUESTION- THE INITIAL

03:10:08.830 --> 03:10:10.532
FUNCTIONALITY OF THAT SPEECH AS

03:10:10.599 --> 03:10:11.600
I MENTIONED IT'S PRIMARILY

03:10:11.666 --> 03:10:13.535
PRIMARILY JUST TO STREAMLINE THE

03:10:13.602 --> 03:10:15.170
VERIFICATION PROCESS WHEN A

03:10:15.237 --> 03:10:17.973
PERSON APPLIES FOR AN INDIVIDUAL

03:10:18.039 --> 03:10:22.043
SPECIFIC PROGRAM. THAT- WE DON'T

03:10:22.110 --> 03:10:23.845
WE GET INITIAL ROLLOUT OF IT

03:10:23.912 --> 03:10:25.714
WILL NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO

03:10:25.781 --> 03:10:27.549
BASED ON WHAT SOMEONE HAD

03:10:27.616 --> 03:10:29.251
SUBMITTED SAY WHAT OTHER

03:10:29.317 --> 03:10:30.051
PROGRAMS SOMEONE MIGHT BE

03:10:30.118 --> 03:10:32.020
ELIGIBLE FOR- BUT THAT'S

03:10:32.087 --> 03:10:33.355
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT YOU

03:10:33.421 --> 03:10:34.689
KNOW WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN

03:10:34.756 --> 03:10:35.924
EXPLORING WILL PROBABLY REQUIRES

03:10:35.991 --> 03:10:38.827
INFORMATION WITH THAT OF

03:10:38.894 --> 03:10:41.196
PALESTINE'S. TEENS WELL. I LOOK

03:10:41.263 --> 03:10:43.398
FORWARD TO THAT TOO IF WE CAN

03:10:43.465 --> 03:10:44.699
USE THE INFORMATION TO KEEP

03:10:44.766 --> 03:10:46.301
PEOPLE OFF THE PROGRAMS WE

03:10:46.368 --> 03:10:47.569
SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE

03:10:47.636 --> 03:10:49.704
INFORMATION TO. FIGURE OUT WHO

03:10:49.771 --> 03:10:51.706
QUALIFIES SO WE CAN MAKE OUT

03:10:51.773 --> 03:10:54.009
REACH AND ENGAGEMENT AND- AGAIN

03:10:54.075 --> 03:10:55.277
PULL DOWN AS MANY FEDERAL

03:10:55.343 --> 03:10:57.679
RESOURCES AS POSSIBLE TO BENEFIT

03:10:57.746 --> 03:10:59.848
THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND-

03:10:59.915 --> 03:11:01.049
WILL JUST ELEVATE AGAIN THE

03:11:01.116 --> 03:11:06.488

03:11:08.223 --> 03:11:09.724
DETERMINANTS OF EDUCATION IT'S

03:11:09.791 --> 03:11:11.426
AWFULLY HARD TO STUDY AND DO

PROGRAM. HOW THEY ARE

03:24:01.829 --> 03:24:04.265
DIFFERENTIATED WHETHER THEY'RE

03:24:04.332 --> 03:24:07.602
DUPLICATE AS FAR THEY SEPARATE

03:24:07.668 --> 03:24:08.469
I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO

EDGES FOR. WATER NEEDS FOR THE

03:24:15.676 --> 03:24:18.079
STATE- IN COMPARISON TO WHAT WE

03:24:18.145 --> 03:24:19.513
FUNDED FOR BOTH THE STATE WATER

03:24:19.580 --> 03:24:22.383
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND LIVE

03:24:22.450 --> 03:24:25.319
OFF. SURE THE FROM WHAT WE

UNDERSTAND THAT THE STATE WATER-

03:24:27.989 --> 03:24:29.457
THE THAT'S THE WATER BOARD'S

03:24:29.523 --> 03:24:31.792
PROGRAM IS REALLY JUST BEING

03:24:31.859 --> 03:24:34.662
PAID OFF AT THE UTILITY LEVEL SO

03:24:34.729 --> 03:24:36.831
THAT FUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED TO

03:24:36.897 --> 03:24:38.766
THE WATER UTILITIES THEMSELVES.

03:24:38.833 --> 03:24:40.534
WHERE HAS THE LIFELOCK IS

03:24:40.601 --> 03:24:42.470
BASICALLY A CUSTOMER BASED

03:24:42.536 --> 03:24:45.006
PROGRAM- THE CUSTOMER COMES INTO

03:24:45.072 --> 03:24:46.040
A LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDER WITH A

03:24:46.107 --> 03:24:48.275
BILL. THAT BILL CAN'T BE PAID

03:24:48.342 --> 03:24:49.710
HOWEVER THERE NEEDS TO BE A

03:24:49.777 --> 03:24:51.479
DIRECT PAY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE

03:24:51.545 --> 03:24:52.913
WATER SERVICE PROVIDER THAT THE

03:24:52.980 --> 03:24:54.982
CUSTOMER. PAYS THEIR BILL TO.

03:24:55.049 --> 03:24:56.517
ARM AND THAT LOCAL SERVICE

03:24:56.584 --> 03:24:58.052
PROVIDER IN THE STATE BECAUSE

03:24:58.119 --> 03:25:00.087
THE STATE IS NOT ABLE TO PAY

03:25:00.154 --> 03:25:02.623
ANY. OF FUNDS DIRECTLY TO THE

03:25:02.690 --> 03:25:04.625
CONSUMER THEMSELVES OF MOSCOW TO

03:25:04.692 --> 03:25:06.994
THE WATER SERVICE PROVIDER SO

03:25:07.061 --> 03:25:08.429
THAT MADE EACH MAJOR

03:25:08.496 --> 03:25:10.197
DIFFERENTIAL IS THAT THE WATER

03:25:10.264 --> 03:25:12.900
BOARD'S PROGRAM IS THAT THE AS A

03:25:12.967 --> 03:25:14.468
LARGE UTILITY LEVEL THAT CAN

03:25:14.535 --> 03:25:17.838
TAKE. AN AGGREGATE NUMBER OF-

03:25:17.905 --> 03:25:18.939
RESEARCHES AND PAY THEM ALL AT

03:25:19.006 --> 03:25:22.176
ONCE WHEREAS LIVEWATCH IS A ONE

03:25:22.243 --> 03:25:23.110
CUSTOMER ONE APPLICATION

03:25:23.177 --> 03:25:26.080
APPROACH- THE L. IT'S A LITTLE

03:25:26.147 --> 03:25:27.548
MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THEN WE

03:25:27.615 --> 03:25:29.083
HAVE TO ENTER TO ENTER INTO A

03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:32.920
MULTIPLE. DIRECT PAY AGREEMENTS

03:25:32.987 --> 03:25:35.256
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- THIS

03:25:35.322 --> 03:25:35.890
QUESTION A FOR FINANCE IF THERE

03:25:35.956 --> 03:25:38.325
ARE UNSPENT FUNDS WITHIN THE

03:25:38.392 --> 03:25:39.360
STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL

03:25:39.427 --> 03:25:41.595
BOARD. COULD THEY BE REPURPOSED

03:25:41.662 --> 03:25:44.298
TOWARDS A CARE LIKE PROGRAM TO

03:25:44.365 --> 03:25:47.435
ASSIST. WITH DISCOUNTED OR

03:25:47.501 --> 03:25:48.803
ADJUSTED WATER BILLS FOR LOW

03:25:48.869 --> 03:25:51.238
INCOME CUSTOMERS AS IT STILL

03:25:51.305 --> 03:25:53.474
ALONG THE SAME MODALITY OF

03:25:53.541 --> 03:25:55.476
CREATING AFFORDABILITY FOR THOSE

03:25:55.543 --> 03:25:59.380
WHO HAVE WATER NEEDS. IT'S NOT A

03:25:59.447 --> 03:26:00.815
PART OF FINANCE I THINK THAT

03:26:00.881 --> 03:26:02.416
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD

03:26:02.483 --> 03:26:04.018
HAVE TO- HAVE FOR THE

03:26:04.085 --> 03:26:06.554
CONVERSATIONS GOING TO SAVE- HOW

03:26:06.620 --> 03:26:08.656
THE ADMINISTRATION I WANT TO

03:26:08.723 --> 03:26:11.058
SPEND THE SAVINGS IF THEY'RE

03:26:11.125 --> 03:26:11.792
ALREADY. I WOULD. POINT OUT I

03:26:11.859 --> 03:26:14.195
BELIEVE THERE'S A SENATE BILL BY

03:26:14.261 --> 03:26:16.664
SENATOR DODD S. B. TWO TWO TWO

03:26:16.731 --> 03:26:19.667
THAT MAY CREATE. THE MECHANISM

03:26:19.734 --> 03:26:22.036
THAT IS THE CARE LIKE FOR.

03:26:22.103 --> 03:26:24.105
ADDRESSING SOME OF THE- LOW

03:26:24.171 --> 03:26:26.173
INCOME WATER USERS IN OUR STATE

03:26:26.240 --> 03:26:28.642
AS THE MODEL FOR US TO LOOK

03:26:28.709 --> 03:26:30.511
TOWARDS TO SEE IF IT'S

03:26:30.578 --> 03:26:32.113
APPLICABLE- AND WOULD LOVE. TO

03:26:32.179 --> 03:26:33.481
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CURRENT

03:26:33.547 --> 03:26:35.483
FUNDS ARE WITHIN STATE WATER

03:26:35.549 --> 03:26:37.284
