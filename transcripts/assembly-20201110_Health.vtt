SOME OF THE CURRENT

ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE HAVE

00:29:36.374 --> 00:29:38.176
IMPLEMENTED THOSE MODELS IN OUR

THAT IS THE CASE THE SENATE UP

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.361
FOR MY COLLEAGUES WHO WILL TALK

00:29:56.427 --> 00:29:58.296
LATER ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS OF

ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS. NEXT

00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:05.069
SLIDE PLEASE. SO FIRST A LITTLE

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:06.838
A LITTLE BIT ON TERMINOLOGY

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:09.073
SINCE THE TERM HA ITSELF CAN BE

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.610
AMBIGUOUS- SO. ESSENTIALLY IT'S

00:30:12.677 --> 00:30:15.013
OFTEN USED IN TO. SOMEWHAT

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:17.215
DISTINCT WAYS FIRST AS H. I. E.

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:19.150
THE BIRD AND IN THIS SENSE

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:21.252
REFERS TO THE ACT OF

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:22.153
ELECTRONICALLY SHARING PATIENT

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.855

CARE. ORGANIZATIONS SHARING OF

00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:27.592
THAT THE ACT OF SHARING THAT

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:30.361

OR TYPE OF ORGANIZATION

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:37.569
INVOLVED WITH IT- IT'S JUST A

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:40.104
THE GENERAL- FACT OF.

00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:42.140
PERFORMING THAT SHARING. IN THE

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:44.242
SECOND USE THAT THEN HA THE

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:46.945
NOUN. IN IN DISTINCTION IS

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.079
OFTEN USED TO REFER TO AN

ACROSS EVEN ACROSS REGIONS. SO

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:10.768
I'M NOT A FAN OF. THIS USING

THE TERM. AS A AS A NOUN

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:14.672
BECAUSE IT'S CONFUSING AND

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:16.841
AMBIGUOUS SO MAYBE FOR PURPOSES

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:18.209
OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION MY

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:20.078

HIV THE FOR THE ACT OF SHARING

00:31:37.962 --> 00:31:39.764
INFORMATION ESSENTIALLY BOILS

00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:41.566
DOWN TO THE FACT THAT OUR OUR

REMAINS FRAGMENTED- IN THE

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:47.639
SENSE THAT A SINGLE PATIENT

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:09.627
IDENIFY A LUMP OF SOME SORT

00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:12.263
SOMEWHERE SENDING THEM OFF TO

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:12.797
NUMBER TWELVE THE IMAGING

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:13.197

ORGANIZATION- WHERE SCANNING IS

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.103
PERFORMED AND- PERHAPS- CANCER

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.339
FOUND A NECESSITATING A TRIP TO

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:34.485
THAT AND SO FORTH ALL THESE

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:36.387
ORGANIZATIONS MAY BE DIFFERENT

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:38.656

IN THEIR NATIVE FORM. SO N. AND

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.169
IN FACT A STILL TODAY THERE'S

00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:52.837

CONSOLIDATION AMONG THESE

00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:04.482
ORGANIZATIONS NOT LEAST BECAUSE

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:05.116
THE SHARING OF HEALTH

THIS CARE PROCESS WE'RE LOOKING

00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:17.862
AT HERE. WHAT TO WHAT IS THE

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:19.497
USE OF H. WATER USE CASES ARE

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:21.332
EXAMPLES OF HOW HEALTH

HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES TO

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:39.350
FACILITATE TRANSFERS OF CARE SO

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:40.685
FOR EXAMPLE POSITION SEEING A

PICTURE THAT PATIENTS HISTORY

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:55.633
REALLY WOULD NEED TO COLLECT

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.201

GENERATE- SOCIAL VALUE I GUESS

00:38:16.494 --> 00:38:17.795
YOU COULD SAY IN AT LEAST THREE

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:21.565
WAYS FIRST IS- JUST CLINICAL

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:23.634
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT THROUGH

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.403
PROMPTLY PROVIDING ALL THE

DIFFERENT PROVIDER

00:38:38.015 --> 00:38:40.184
ORGANIZATIONS- AND THAT

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.752
REPORTING AND TRACKING UNTO

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:43.888
ITSELF- THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT

00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:45.289
THAT HELPS IMPROVE QUALITY OF

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:48.359

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:50.094
PROVIDERS TO FOCUS ON IT

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:51.662
IMPORTANTLY IN ORDER TO DO THAT

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:54.965
EFFECTIVELY. FOR MORE VALUE

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:56.867
BASED CARE PROGRAMS ALL

ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MECHANISMS

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:02.239
ONE NEEDS TO OF. RISK ADJUST

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:03.574
THOSE DATA APPROPRIATELY IN

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:05.009
ORDER TO DO THAT THE FULL

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:06.577
CLINICAL PICTURE OF THE

00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:08.345
PATIENT'S SITUATION NEEDS TO BE

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:09.814
KNOWN ALL THE PATIENTS DATA

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.215
NEEDS TO BE FACTORED IN A

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:13.417
INCLUDING A SOCIAL DETERMINANT

00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:15.886
DATA NOT JUST MEDICAL DATA- SO

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:18.789
THAT'S THAT'S A- DOES A WAYS IN

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:19.290
WHICH HEALTH INFORMATION

00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:20.524
EXCHANGE CAN IMPROVE- CLINICAL

00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:22.927
QUALITY. TERMS OF COST CONTROL

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:25.162
OBVIOUSLY ACCESS TO PRIOR

00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:28.265
RECENT TEST RESULTS CAN-

00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:30.901
OBVIATE THE NEED TO REDO THOSE

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:32.603
TESTS JUST TO BECAUSE THE

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.605
RESULTS AREN'T. DON'T HAPPEN TO

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:35.706
BE AVAILABLE IN THE EMERGENCY

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:38.008
DEPARTMENT OR A SPECIALIST THAT

00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:39.477
THAT THEIR OBVIOUS COST SAVINGS

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:40.811
AND NOT ESPECIALLY FOR VERY

00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:42.179
EXPENSIVE TYPE OF IMAGING

00:39:42.246 --> 00:39:44.515
STUDIES AND SO FORTH- IN IN

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:45.850
IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE CAN

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:47.752
ALSO REDUCE COSTS BY REDUCING

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:49.286
HOSPITALIZATIONS OR RE

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:51.489
HOSPITALIZATIONS WHEN BETTER

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:53.524
CARES PROVIDING OUTPATIENT.

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:54.925
SETTING AND EARLIER

00:39:54.992 --> 00:39:56.327
INTERVENTIONS CAN BEFORE WHEN

00:39:56.393 --> 00:39:57.294
THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE KNOWN TO

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:59.997
BE NEEDED- AGAIN HAVING A FULL

PICTURE OF THE PATIENT'S

00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:02.366
CLINICAL DATA CAN ASSIST WITH

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:03.734
THAT AND OF COURSE THERE'S

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:05.236
REDUCING THE ADMINISTRATIVE.

00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:06.604
COSTS AND INEFFICIENT PAPER

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.272
BASED COMMUNICATIONS FINALLY

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:11.408
NOT NOT LEAST IMPORTANTLY THESE

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:12.743
DAYS THERE'S A PUBLIC VALLEY

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.712
SICK PUBLIC HEALTH VALUE IN

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:15.813
SHARING PATIENT DATA

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.317
AGGREGATING PATIENT DATA. TO

DIZZY SURVEY. EPIDEMIOLOGY

00:40:23.687 --> 00:40:25.589
CONTACT TRACING AND SO FORTH

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:28.492
FOR EXAMPLE- WHEN CASE REPORTS

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.728
ARE RECEIVED OF COCA NINETEEN

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:33.397
POSITIVE RESULTS- PERHAPS

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:34.298
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:35.900
BENEFIT FROM KNOWING WHAT OTHER

COMORBIDITIES THOSE PATIENTS

00:40:37.334 --> 00:40:38.836
HAD. ARE WHAT SOME OF THEIR

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:40.137
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:42.907
WERE- IN ORDER TO PRIORITIZE

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:44.675
FOR EXAMPLE CONTACT TRACING OR

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:46.877
TO PROVIDE A NECESSARY

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:47.812
COMMUNICATION TO THOSE

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:50.414
PATIENTS. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:52.750
TO FOLLOW UP WITH THEM FOR

00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:54.318
NEEDED TREATMENT. NEXT SLIDE

00:40:54.385 --> 00:41:03.460
PLEASE. THERE IT IS- SO HOW

00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:04.862
DOES THAT SWITCHING GEARS HOW

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:05.629
DOES HEALTH INFORMATION

00:41:05.696 --> 00:41:08.833
EXCHANGE THE VERB HAPPEN- WHAT

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:09.567
ARE SOME OF THE TECHNICAL

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:11.769
METHODS I WON'T GO INTO INTO

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:12.636
THIS IN GREAT DETAIL OF COURSE

00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:14.905
TODAY BUT- I THINK AT A CERTAIN

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:16.707
UNDERSTANDING OF IT IS HELPFUL

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.275
TO UNDERSTAND PUBLIC POLICY

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:20.477
DECISIONS AND CHOICES AS WELL

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:21.278
SO IN GENERAL FROM THE

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:22.479
TECHNICAL MODEL POINT OF VIEW

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:24.882
THERE'S A SPECTRUM BETWEEN A

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:27.585
CENTRALIZED. MODEL OF HEALTH

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:29.086
INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND- AND A

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:31.222
VERY DECENTRALIZED MODEL ON THE

00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:33.190
LEFT HAND SIDE IS A DEPICTION

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:35.893
OF A CENTRALIZED MODEL IN WHICH

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.927
ALL OF THE HEALTH CARE

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:38.128
ENTERPRISES PARTICIPATING IN

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.163
PATIENTS CARE ACTUALLY

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.165
CONTRIBUTE THEIR DATA THEY A

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:43.500
COPY THEIR DATA INTO A CENTRAL

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:45.870
DATA REPOSITORY AND THERE ARE

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:47.338
CENTRALIZED SERVICES FOR

00:41:47.404 --> 00:41:49.073
MANAGING THOSE DATA AND

00:41:49.139 --> 00:41:50.274
CONTROLLING ACCESS TO THOSE

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:52.142
DATA AND SO FORTH IT'S VERY

00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:55.212
CENTRALIZED PROCESS SO- JUST- A

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:56.847
ROUGHLY THIS IS ANALOGOUS TO A

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:58.115
SYSTEM LIKE FACEBOOK WHERE WE

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.617
ALL WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:01.285
EACH OTHER IN A SENSE. BUT ALL

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:02.887
OF ITS ALL BEING ORGANIZED BY

00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:04.622
BY PARTICULAR ENTITY IN THIS

00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:06.223
CASE THAT'S CONTROLLING THE

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.192
DATA AND CONTROLLING ACCESS TO

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:10.394
THE DATA AND SO FORTH WITHOUT

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:11.862
WHICH NONE OF IT COULD HAPPEN.

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:13.130
CONVERSELY ON THE RIGHT HAND

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.632
SIDE AT THE OTHER END OF THE

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:15.165
SPECTRUM IS A VERY

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:16.934
DECENTRALIZED MODEL WHERE

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:19.270
ORGANIZATIONS ARE ON A POINT TO

00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:20.871
POINT BASIS JUST CONFINING AND

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.339
COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:23.874
AND SENDING INFORMATION THAT

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:25.709
THAT THAT- THEY EACH MAY NEED

00:42:25.776 --> 00:42:27.144
TO CENTER MAY NEED TO ASK FOR

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:29.179
AND RECEIVE- AND THERE'S NO

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:31.582
CENTRALIZED ENTITY MANAGING AND

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:32.983
CONTROLLING IT ALSO THIS IS

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.285
ROUGHLY AGAIN AND NOW IT IS TO

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:35.419
THE EMAIL SYSTEM THAT WE'RE ALL

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:36.954
USED TO THERE'S NO BIG. THERE'S

00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:38.589
NO FACEBOOK FOR EMAIL IT'S JUST

00:42:38.656 --> 00:42:39.690
A LOT OF DIFFERENT EMAIL

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:41.058
SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THE

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:43.727
INTERNET BACKBONE THAT ENABLE

00:42:43.794 --> 00:42:45.095
THE EXCHANGE OF EMAIL AMONG ALL

00:42:45.162 --> 00:42:46.697
OF US AND HAD FOR A VERY LONG

00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:50.534
TIME SO THOSE. ARE THE TWO

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:51.101
DIFFERENT MODELS NEXT SLIDE

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:54.471
PLEASE. IN PRACTICE OF COURSE

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:56.707
THERE'S A SPECTRUM. BETWEEN

00:42:56.774 --> 00:42:57.841
THESE TWO MODELS VERY FEW

00:42:57.908 --> 00:43:00.611
SYSTEMS ARE AT THE EXTREMES-

00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:02.680
AND MANY ARE IN THE MIDDLE WITH

00:43:02.746 --> 00:43:04.581
A PARTS PARTIALLY. PARTIALLY

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:05.783
DECENTRALIZED PARTIALLY

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:07.985
FEDERATED. MODEL NEXT SLIDE

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:10.120
PLEASE. SO NOMINA TALKED

00:43:10.187 --> 00:43:12.756
BRIEFLY ABOUT. HOW THE HELL

00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:14.959
THESE MODELS WORK. A LITTLE

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:17.394
BIT. WITHOUT GETTING WITHOUT

00:43:17.461 --> 00:43:19.096
BORING YOU ALL HOPEFULLY I'LL

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:20.664
HAVE THE TECHNICAL DETAILS SO

00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:22.366
THERE'S A DEPICTION OF A FULLY

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:23.600
CENTRALIZED AGGREGATED MODEL

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:26.236
THE- THE BLUE AREAS ARE THE

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:28.472
CENTRALIZED SERVICES. WE SEE

MEDICAL RECORD NUMBERS

00:43:56.633 --> 00:43:57.968
DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS TO

00:43:58.035 --> 00:44:00.804
IDENTIFY THE SAME PATIENTS- SO.

00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:02.639
IN ORDER TO HAVE A COMPLETE

00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:03.741

ACCOMPLISHED- IF IT PRESENTS AS

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:20.084
I MENTIONED A NICE CLEAN

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:21.652
ORGANIZED FOR VIEW THE DATA.

00:45:21.718 --> 00:45:23.921
BUT ALSO SUPPORTS- ANALYTICAL

00:45:23.987 --> 00:45:25.622

END OF THE SPECTRUM AT A FULLY

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:47.111
DECENTRALIZED AND FEDERATED

00:45:47.177 --> 00:45:48.445
MODEL OF HEALTH INFORMATION

00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:50.314
EXCHANGE HERE IN THE MIDDLE YOU

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.182
SEE YOU DON'T SEE A PATIENT

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:53.584
DATA REPOSITORY THERE'S NO

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.552
CENTRALIZED STORAGE FOR THE

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:57.387
DATA THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST AS A

00:45:57.454 --> 00:45:59.790
SET OF STANDARDS AND RULES- BY

00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:01.725
WHICH THE VARIOUS HEALTH CARE

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:03.794
ENTERPRISES EXCHANGE DATA IN A

00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:04.828
POINT TO POINT MATTER THEY

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:07.264
SUBMITTED TO EACH OTHER OR THEY

CENTRALIZED DATA REPOSITORY

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:12.536
MANAGEMENT SO THERE'S NO MASTER

00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:18.008
JUDICATA FRIEND REPRESENTATIONS

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:19.409
OF THE SAME PATIENTS THERE'S NO

DIRECTORY. OF WHICH

00:46:20.944 --> 00:46:22.079
ORGANIZATIONS OF WHICH PATIENTS

00:46:22.146 --> 00:46:24.481
DATA- THERE COULD BE DUPLICATE

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:26.150
COPIES OF DATA ACROSS DIFFERENT

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:28.385
ORGANIZATIONS. IT'S UP TO. EACH

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:29.786
ORGANIZATION WHEN THEY RECEIVE

00:46:29.853 --> 00:46:32.322
THOSE COPIES TO SORT THAT OUT-

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:33.323
BUT IN SOME WAYS THEIR

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:34.458
ADVANTAGES TO THIS MODEL AS

00:46:34.525 --> 00:46:37.127
WELL- IN THAT. THERE'S LESS

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:38.996
PERCEIVED RISK IN MANY CASES BY

00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:40.531
THE PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:42.132
BY THE HEALTHCARE FUNDS.

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:43.667
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO YOU.

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:45.302
DON'T HAVE THIS SECURITY RISK

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:47.237
PRIVACY RISK FOR EXAMPLE OF. OF

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:48.772
SENDING ALL OF THEIR PATIENT

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:50.941
DATA TO A THIRD PARTY. AND

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:52.242
HAVING TO TRUST THAT THIRD

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:53.644
PARTY TO PROTECT THAT DATA

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.345
THERE'S ALSO. LESS BUSINESS

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:57.414
RISK PERCEIVED BUSINESS RISK IN

00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.283
THAT IN THAT THEIR PATIENT DATA

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:00.417
IS SEEN BY MANY HEALTH CARE

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:02.352
ORGANIZATIONS. AS AS A

00:47:02.419 --> 00:47:04.555
STRATEGIC ASSET AND A

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:06.924
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO THEM-

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.925
AND THERE'S ALSO GEN GENERAL

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:09.760
FOR THIS DECENTRALIZED MODEL

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:11.728
THEIR LOWER COST OF OPERATING

00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:13.864
THE MODEL- BECAUSE YOU DON'T

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:15.465
HAVE TO MAINTAIN A MASTER

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:16.099
PATIENT INDEX AND SOME OF THE

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:17.734
OTHER CENTRALIZED.

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:20.237
INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES OF THE

00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:22.105
CENTRALIZED MODEL. SO AS YOU

00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:23.607
CAN SEE THE PROS AND CONS IN

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:27.711
THIS MODEL. NOW IN BETWEEN THE

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:29.713
TWO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND THEN

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:30.547
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN UP IN THE

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:31.815
LEFT HAND CORNER OF THE SLIDES

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:33.450
ARE THERE EXAMPLES OF HEALTH

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:35.285
INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:37.621
WITHIN CALIFORNIA THAT- HAVE

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:38.488
IMPLEMENTED THESE VARIOUS

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:40.724
MODELS- SO THE ALL OF THESE

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:42.226
MODELS EXIST SOMEWHERE IN THE

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:44.494
STATE. SO THIS DOES PARTIALLY

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:46.363
CENTRALIZED PARTIALLY FEDERATED

THE STATE THEY'RE BASED ON

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:11.675
BECAUSE THEY'RE BASED ON

THE MEMBERS OF THESE. H. IOS

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:28.892
IS- IS HIGHLY VARIABLE IN ANY

THEY BOTH USE EHRS THAT ARE IN

00:55:42.372 --> 00:55:43.807
THAT NETWORK WHERE IS TO

PARTICULAR CITY MAY NOT BE ABLE

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:49.079
TO USE THAT NETWORK BECAUSE

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:50.980
THAT'S NOT THE CASE. SIMILARLY

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:53.183

SERVING THE SLIDE IS UP OF. THE

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:23.713
AS I MENTIONED THERE'S A

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.715

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:49.199
SAME REGIONS AS SHOWN IN THESE.

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:52.569
OVERLAPPING LAYER DEPICTION OF

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:53.469
DIFFERENT HEALTH INFORMATION

00:57:53.536 --> 00:57:55.805

IN FACT AS WE CAN SEE HERE IS

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:25.802
THAT THE- IN THE TRUE STATE OF

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:27.704
THE WORLD. ORGANISE THEIR SOME

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:28.872
ORGANIZATIONS THAT PARTICIPATE

00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:30.373
IN MULTIPLE OF THESE HEALTH

INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS IN A

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:33.910
PARTICULAR REGION. AND SO THAT

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:35.645
EXPANDS THE HEALTH INFORMATION

00:58:35.712 --> 00:58:37.013
EXCHANGE CAPABILITIES OF ANY

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.948
PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION SO WE

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:40.516
SEE HERE TWO OF THE MEMBERS OF

00:58:40.583 --> 00:58:43.519
THE REGIONAL H. I. OR ALSO CARE.

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:45.588
MEMBERS SO DOES TWO CAN.

00:58:45.655 --> 00:58:47.023
COMMUNICATE EXCHANGE DATA WITH

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:49.926
ANY OTHER CARE QUALITY MEMBERS

00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:50.460
BUT THE OTHER REGIONAL HR

MEMBERS CANNOT AND UP IT UP AT.

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:56.065
THE TOP OF ONE OF THE CARE

00:58:56.132 --> 00:58:57.700
QUALITY MEMBER PARTICIPANTS IS

00:58:57.767 --> 00:58:59.135
ALSO AN INTEGRATED DELIVERY

00:58:59.202 --> 00:59:00.670
NETWORK SO THAT ORGANIZATIONS

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:02.038
CAN EXCHANGE DATA NOT ONLY WITH

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:03.139
THE OTHER CARE QUALITY MEMBERS

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:04.274
BUT WITH. THOSE OF THE

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.209
INTEGRATED LIVER YOU KNOW. THE

00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:06.743
OTHER IN A GREAT DELIVERY

00:59:06.809 --> 00:59:08.478

ANY OTHER NETWORK MEMBERS SO.

00:59:13.316 --> 00:59:15.184
THERE'S THAT COMP COMPLEXITY

00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:18.488
AND THE GAPS THAT ARE-

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:19.656
ENGENDERED BY THAT AS WELL.

00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:26.863
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND THEN THE

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.599
MOST COMMON KIND OF- GAP THAT

THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HELLO

00:59:31.567 --> 00:59:32.635
IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THE ONLY GAP

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:36.105
IS WHERE THERE'S A REGION. THAT

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:37.473
DOESN'T HAVE A REGIONAL H. I.

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.043

EARLIER. THAT HAPPENED AND

00:59:49.852 --> 00:59:51.454
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO HEALTH

00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:52.755
INFORMATION SHARING BY REGIONAL

00:59:52.822 --> 00:59:54.257

MENTIONED IMPORTANTLY THOUGH.

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:27.457
THOSE NETWORKS OFTEN DON'T

PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:31.561
SERVICES AS A REGIONAL H. I. L.

01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:33.096

DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:17.887
BETWEEN A FEDERATED MODEL THE

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.789
CENTRALIZED MODEL N A HYBRID

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:21.924
MODEL IN TERMS OF HOW THE DATA

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:25.695
IS MAINTAINED- DO YOU SEE. ANY

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:28.798
PARTICULAR ADVANTAGES IN ANY IN

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:30.433
IN IN ANY OF THOSE APPROACHES I

01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:32.068
MEAN WOULD YOU WOULD YOU WERE.

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:33.769
COULD YOU CONCEIVABLY RANK THEM

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:35.504
OR- AND THAT MAY BE A DIFFICULT

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:37.240
THING TO DO BUT- YOU KNOW DO

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:40.343
YOU SEE- WHICH YOU YOU KIND OF

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:43.212
HIT ON A LITTLE BIT BUT- IF. IF

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:44.113
YOU WERE DOES LET ME PUT IT

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.615
THIS WAY THIS WAY IF YOU WERE

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:48.417
TO DIE DESIGN A SYSTEM- HOW

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:55.291
WOULD YOU DO IT. YES THANK YOU

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:57.860
FOR THE QUESTION OF. DOT I

01:04:57.927 --> 01:04:59.595
GUESS THE SHORT ANSWER IS THERE

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:00.496
I DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.565
RANK THE APPROACHES IN IN A

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:05.034
VERY PRACTICAL SENSE IN TERMS

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:07.203
OF WHAT'S THE BEST TARGET-

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:10.273
BECAUSE THERE ARE- ADVANTAGES

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:14.510
AND CHALLENGES TO ALL OF THEM

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:15.077
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT ALL

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:16.846
NECESSARY TECHNICAL- SO THERE

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:19.148
MAY BE ONE MODEL MIGHT PROVIDE

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:20.883
THE MOST FUNCTIONALITY FROM A

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.285
TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW BUT IT

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.953
MIGHT COST THE MOST. OR IT

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.656
MIGHT BE IT MIGHT NOT BE

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:28.924
PALATABLE TO ALL OF THE HEALTH

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:30.393
CARE ORGANIZATION WHO YOU WANT

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:31.761
TO PARTICIPATE SO THAT FOR

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:32.895
EXAMPLE IN THE ABSENCE OF SOME

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:35.197
TYPE OF MANDATE- IT WOULD NOT

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:37.033
ACHIEVE A BROAD ENOUGH

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:38.334
PARTICIPATION COULD REALLY

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:39.502
CREATE THAT LONGITUDINAL

01:05:39.568 --> 01:05:40.903
PATIENT RECORD IF THAT WAS YOUR

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:43.039
GOAL AND IT MAY BE. MORE

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:46.008
FEASIBLE MORE PRACTICAL TO

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:48.911
SHOOT FOR- MAYBE LESS DAA

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:50.813
SHARING FUNCTIONALITY BUT

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.581
BROADER PARTICIPATION SO

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:54.650
GETTING SOME DATA FROM EVERYONE

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:57.787
RATHER THAN- ALL DATA FROM FROM

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:59.188
TRYING TO GET ALL DATA FROM

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:00.589
FROM A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:02.525
MANY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS ALL

01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:04.660
THOSE TRADE OFFS ARE YOU KNOW.

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:06.762
IN IN PLAY AND THOSE ARE- YOU

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:07.463
KNOW GET THOSE AT THE

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.098
COMPLICATED PUBLIC POLICY

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:11.167
CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE. ABOVE

01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:13.402
MY PAY GRADE- FROM FROM THAT

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:17.506
PERSPECTIVE. IN TERMS OF IDEAL.

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:19.175
PERSONALLY I FEEL YOU KNOW I

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:20.276
THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:22.078
WITH ME THAT THE IDEAL IS

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:23.779
REALLY TO HAVE A CENTRAL DATA

01:06:23.846 --> 01:06:26.015
REPOSITORY OF ALL THE PATIENTS

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:27.183
STATE AND HAVE A LONGITUDINAL

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:28.918
PATIENT. PATIENT RECORD THERE

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:32.822
THAT- YOU KNOW ALL ALL RELEVANT

01:06:32.888 --> 01:06:34.790
AUTHORIZED ORGANIZATIONS AND

01:06:34.857 --> 01:06:36.959
PROVIDERS CAN HAVE ACCESS TO

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:38.094
THAT'S MAINTAINED THAT'S

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.730
COMPLETE AND MAINTAIN UP TO

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:42.698
DATE IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER-

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:43.866
SO THAT THERE'S ESSENTIALLY A

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:46.168
SINGLE. MEDICAL RECORD FOR

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:47.970
EVERY PATIENT IN THE STATE AND

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:49.739
THEN YOU CAN DO ALL KINDS OF.

01:06:49.805 --> 01:06:51.307
ANALYSES AGAINST THAT IT'S

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:52.541
NICELY ORGANIZED IT'S VERY

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:53.943
EFFICIENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T

01:06:54.009 --> 01:06:55.878
HAVE MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.913
EACH D. DUPLICATING AN

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.715
ORGANIZING AND LINKING

01:06:59.782 --> 01:07:03.419
PATIENTS- YOU KNOW OF A

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:05.654
REDUNDANTLY- SO IN SOME SENSE

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:06.856
THAT'S IT THAT'S A THAT'S AN

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:08.491
IDEAL BUT WHETHER THAT IS.

01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:10.893
FEASIBLE FOR YOU KNOW FOR THE

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.228
REASONS OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:13.929
PIECES OF THE PIE IN THE COST

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:17.266
OF DOING THAT AND SO FORTH. IS

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.235
OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT QUESTION.

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:21.203
THANK YOU I'M CAN YOU CLARIFY-

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.172
MANIFEST MEDICS MEDICS-

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.875
CLASSIFICATION AS A REGIONAL H.

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:28.244
I. O. IS AS IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:30.279
TO ME IT'S A STATE WIDE. H. I.

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:32.548
E. WITH PROVIDER PARTICIPANTS

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:33.382
IN HIRTY EIGHT OF FIFTY EIGHT

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:36.185
COUNTIES HELP PLANNED LIVES IN

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:37.386
EVERY COUNTY MORE THAN A

01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:40.022
HUNDRED PARTICIPATING HOSPITALS

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:40.623
AND CURRENTLY SHARING DATA FOR

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.124
TWENTY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE SO.

01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:44.026
CAN YOU CLARIFY HOW YOU

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:53.369
CLASSIFY THAT. SURE. SURE SO-

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:54.437
SO FIRST OF ALL AS I MENTIONED

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:56.105
AT THE DATA THAT I'M USING THE

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.106
CHARACTERIZATIONS THAT I'M

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:59.275
USING ARE FROM A COUPLE OF

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:00.443
YEARS AGO THINGS ARE MOVING

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:04.513
FAST SO- MANIFESTS MAY HAVE

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.850
ENLARGED ITS FOOTPRINT.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.985
APPRECIABLY FROM A COUPLE OF

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:12.388
YEARS AGO I HAVEN'T COLLECTED

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:13.389
YOU KNOW DATA WE COLLECTED THE

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:16.158
DATA- TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:18.427
TODAY I THINK ONE IN DOING SO

01:08:18.494 --> 01:08:22.898
ONE NEEDS TO CONSIDER- NOT JUST

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:25.000
WHETHER A PARTICULAR H. I. O.

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:27.403
HAS. YOU KNOW MAY HAVE ONE

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.905
PARTICIPANT IN. JUST ONE

01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:31.240
PARTICIPANT FOR EXAMPLE IN A

01:08:31.307 --> 01:08:33.742
LOT OF COUNTIES- AND WHETHER

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.778
THAT GIVES IT A STATE WIDE

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:37.279
FOOTPRINT BUT BUT REALLY WHAT

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:38.514
THE CONCENTRATION OF

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:39.782
PARTICIPANTS AND IN THOSE

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:42.284
COUNTIES IS AND WHERE THAT H.

01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:45.721
I. O. HAS A- SUBSTANTIAL

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.490
CONCENTRATION SUCH THAT ANY

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:49.592
PARTICULAR PARTICIPANT. CAN BE

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:51.694
CONFIDENT THAT THE PATIENT AT

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.062
THE NEW PATIENT FOR EXAMPLE

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:53.896
THAT IT'S ARRIVED IN THEIR

01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:56.131
OFFICE THAT DAY THAT DATA FOR

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:57.099
THAT PATIENT IS GOING TO BE

01:08:57.166 --> 01:09:00.536
AVAILABLE IN THE H. I. L. SO

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:02.338
FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M FROM UP IN.

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:04.540
THE NORTH STATE COUNTY AND

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:05.741
THERE'S ONE ORGANIZATION THERE

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.810
THAT'S PART OF AN H. I. O. FROM

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:10.846
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- BUT NO

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:12.281
OTHERS IN THAT REGION MOST OF

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:13.749
THE CARE THE PATIENTS SEEN IN

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:14.984
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GOING TO BE

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.918
BY OTHER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:18.420
PROVIDERS. SO IF THEY'RE NOT IN

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:22.358
THAT H. I. O. THERE'S A- MORE

01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:23.926
LIMITED VALUE THEN THERE WOULD

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.361
BE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT H. I.

01:09:25.427 --> 01:09:26.962
O. FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.764
WHERE THERE'S MANY MANY OF THE

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:29.498
PART OF THE PROVIDER

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:30.666
ORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:32.268
PARTICIPANTS IN THAT H. I. O.

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:35.871
SO THE CHANCES THAT- DATA FOR

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:37.373
YOU DON'T MORE COMPLETE DATA

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.307
FOR MY PATIENT WILL BE

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:39.341
AVAILABLE TO THAT H. I. ARE

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.477
MUCH HIGHER. SO I'M NOT I'M NOT

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:43.279
AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE DATA FOR

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:44.747
MANIFEST MEDICS OR ANY OF THE

01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:47.883
H. I. OWES AS OF TODAY- SO I

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:50.286
WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT. JUST

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.487
FROM UP. SCIENTIFIC POINT OF

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:52.888
VIEW IF YOU WILL WHAT WHAT IS

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:54.857
THE CONCENTRATION. OF MANIFESTS

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:57.493
OR ANY OTHER H. I. OWES-

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.295
MEMBERSHIP IN VARIOUS PARTS OF

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:04.567
THE STATE. AND WHAT IT WHAT IS

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:07.036
THE WHAT IS TYPICALLY USING ARE

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:10.039
THEY USING- MULTIPLE WAYS OF

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:12.474
IDENTIFYING PATIENTS SO. SO IT

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:14.176
I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:15.344
I'VE HEARD IS THAT THERE'S A

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:17.146
POSSIBILITY THAT YOU KNOW YOU

01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:18.948
DO A QUERY AND YOU END UP WITH

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:20.616
YOU KNOW FORTY SEVEN JOHN

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.251
SMITH'S AND SO ONLY ONE OF THEM

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:24.853
IS. THE REAL JOHN SMITH SO WHAT

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.623
ARE OR WERE USING MULTIPLE WAYS

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:29.892
OF IDENTIFYING THAT PATIENT OR

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:34.129
IS THERE A SINGLE ACCEPTED-

01:10:34.196 --> 01:10:35.631
TRACTOR SOMETHING LIKE A SOCIAL

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:37.399
SECURITY NUMBER SOMETHING. SO

01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:39.401
THAT YOU ACTUALLY MAKE SURE

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:39.969
THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE DATA

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:46.008
FROM THE RIGHT PATIENT. YEAH

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.042
THAT'S A GREAT POINT AND A

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:49.411
GREAT QUESTION AND AS YOU KNOW

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:52.014
IN THE US AND IN CALIFORNIA WE

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.350
HAVE NO. UNIVERSAL PATIENT ID

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.585
YOU KNOW UNIVERSAL MEDICAL ID

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:58.721
LIKE LIKE THERE IT THERE IS IN

01:10:58.787 --> 01:11:03.592
OTHER COUNTRIES- SO WE RELY ON.

01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:05.594
USING OTHER EXISTING IDEAS LIKE

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:06.996
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND

01:11:07.062 --> 01:11:09.798
NAMES AND DATES OF BIRTH. AND

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:11.934
OTHER DATA POINTS- THAT THAT

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:13.302
COULD HELP IN THAT AND THERE'S

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:15.004
NO THERE'S NO MAGIC BULLET FOR

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:16.705
THAT SOME ORGANIZATIONS DON'T.

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.007
DON'T COLLECT EVEN A SOCIAL

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:19.942
SECURITY NUMBER OR DON'T FEEL

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:21.910
COMFORTABLE USING THAT. BECAUSE

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:23.145
OF THE SENSITIVITY OF THAT

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.880
IDENTIFIER IN THEIR PATIENT

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:27.282
MATCHING ACTIVITIES- SO IT'S

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:29.885
SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT A MAGIC

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:32.588
BULLET FOR THAT ALSO. SOME

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:33.656
PATIENTS DON'T HAVE SOCIAL

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:35.891
SECURITY NUMBERS- YOU KNOW

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.660
NEWBORN BABIES AND SMALL CHAU

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:39.228
INFANTS IN THE HOSPITAL MAY NOT

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:41.030
HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER-

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:41.964
YOU KNOW UNDOCUMENTED

01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:43.332
IMMIGRANTS MAY NOT HAVE SO

01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:46.101
SECURE NUMBER ETCETERA- SO.

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.136
AGAIN THERE'S NO PERFECT

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:48.337
SOLUTION FOR THAT DIFFERENT H.

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:49.405
I WAS THERE TO USING DIFFERENT

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.040
TECHNOLOGIES TO DO THIS PATIENT

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:53.008
MATCHING IT'S A WHOLE. FIELD OF

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:55.911
STUDY AND A WHOLE SUB INDUSTRY

01:11:55.978 --> 01:12:00.783
ONTO ITSELF TOOLS. FOR HELPING

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:03.252
TO IDENTIFY. WHICH WHICH

01:12:03.318 --> 01:12:04.887
PATIENTS FROM DIFFERENT

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:05.988
ORGANIZATIONS ARE FACT THE SAME

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:08.557
PEOPLE BASED ON- YOU KNOW THE

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:09.625
DEGREE TO WHICH THEY'RE

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:12.094
DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA FROM

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:12.961
THOSE ORGANIZATIONS MATCH OR DO

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:15.330
NOT MATCH- THERE ARE SOME MORE

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:17.132
ADVANCED. TECHNOLOGIES FOR

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:19.001
DOING THAT THAT INCORPORATE.

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.569
OTHER DATA SOURCES LIKE CREDIT

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:22.805
BUREAUS AND OTHER PUBLIC DATA

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:26.775
SOURCES- TO EXPAND INTO. THE

01:12:26.842 --> 01:12:28.210
TYPES OF DATA THAT ARE

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:29.044
AVAILABLE FOR MATCHING FOR

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:31.380
EXAMPLE CREDIT BUREAUS MAY HAVE

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:33.115
INFORMATION ABOUT A PATIENT'S.

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.683
PERSONS MAIDEN NAME NOT JUST

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.285
THEIR CURRENT NAME THAT CAN BE

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:38.387
USED TO MATCH ACROSS TWO

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:41.356
ORGANIZATIONS- WHERE. THEY KNEW

THE STATE WORKED HAND IN HAND%

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:47.135
WITH PROVIDERS TO SHIFTED FROM

WORKFLOWS THAT LEVERAGE LIKE

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:55.577
TRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. AND TO

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:56.144
BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH THAT

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:57.279
PROCESS. PART OF THE REASON I

01:21:57.345 --> 01:21:58.747
MENTION IT'S PROGRAMS IS THAT

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:00.348
THEY HAVE CARRIED THROUGH AS WE

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:04.019
MOVE FORWARD THANKS TWENTY

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:04.586
FOURTEEN WHEN THOSE AND SEE

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:07.589
PROGRAMS AND THAT. ONE OF THE

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:08.790
THINGS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AS

01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:10.825
WELL- IS THAT OUR ELECTRONIC

01:22:10.892 --> 01:22:12.494
HEALTH RECORD INCENTIVE PROGRAM

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.296
WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN NAMED THE

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:14.996
PROMOTING AN OPPORTUNITY

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:17.499
PROGRAM- REALLY HAVE THREE CORE

01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:19.267
COMPONENTS. AND THESE

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:21.136
COMPONENTS INCLUDED THE IDEA OF

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:22.637
USING A CERTIFIED ELECTRONIC

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:24.506
HEALTH RECORD. THIS MEANT THAT

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:26.908
THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:28.009
HAD KEEP FUNCTIONALITY. BEING

01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:31.179
ABLE TO. SEND AND RECEIVE

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:32.347

SUPPORT VARIOUS SECURITY AND

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:42.924
PRIVACY WORLD. THE SECOND THING

01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:44.626
WAS THAT ELECTRONIC HEALTH

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.328
RECORDS NEEDED TO RECORD AND

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:47.929
PROVIDERS RECEIVING AND SENATE

FINANCE RECORDS NAMES FOR YOUTH

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.099
MEASURES SO DEMONSTRATING OF

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.001
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS COULD

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:54.569
BE USED FOR WHAT WE NEEDED TO

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:55.870
BEING ABLE TO RECORD THINGS

01:22:55.937 --> 01:22:56.604

KEY COMPONENT WHAT'S REPORTING

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:07.315
CLINICAL QUALITY MEASURES SO

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:08.416

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:10.318
CARE THAT WAS BEING PROVIDED.

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:12.220
BY LEVERAGING THOSE ELECTRONIC

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:15.657
MOVED FORWARD THROUGH TIME

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:17.258
THESE HAVE EACH ADVANCED

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:19.194
SIGNIFICANTLY FOR BOTH THE

01:40:47.307 --> 01:40:48.208
OF US THOUGHT THE THOUGHT

01:40:48.275 --> 01:40:49.610
WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN GREAT IF

THEM. BUT THEY ARE PRETTY

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:20.006
SIGNIFICANT AND- IMPACT A BIG

01:46:20.073 --> 01:46:20.540

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:35.388
WHO'S IMPACTED AND WHO HAS

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:35.922
OVERSIGHT OF SOME OF THESE

01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:39.459
REGULATIONS. SO FOR CMS- THESE

01:46:39.526 --> 01:46:40.861
REGULATIONS GOING TO BE

01:46:40.927 --> 01:46:41.628
IMPACTING A LOT OF HEALTH

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:44.564
PLANS. PROVIDERS IN STATES.

01:46:44.631 --> 01:46:45.866
OPTICALLY THOSE THAT

01:46:45.932 --> 01:46:48.735
PARTICIPATE IN CMS PROGRAMS-

01:46:48.802 --> 01:46:51.338
WHICH ON MEDICAID. MEDICARE AND

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:53.907
THE INDIVIDUAL- EXCHANGE MARKET

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:57.310
PLACE. FOR ONC THEY HAVE

01:46:57.377 --> 01:46:59.913
OVERSIGHT- OVER HEALTH I. T.

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:02.816
THEY CERTIFY- I. T. SYSTEMS

01:47:02.883 --> 01:47:04.818
ESSENTIAL EHRS THAT PROVIDERS

01:47:04.885 --> 01:47:07.254
USE TO STORE THEIR CLINICAL

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:09.756
DATA. SO ESSENTIALLY BY A SORT

01:47:09.823 --> 01:47:11.925
OF AN INDIRECT RELATIONSHIP ONC

01:47:11.992 --> 01:47:13.827
HAS IS SORT OF IMPACTS OF

01:47:13.894 --> 01:47:16.129
PROVIDERS BECAUSE PROVIDERS ARE

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:17.964
INCENTIVIZED TO USE CERTIFIED

01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:20.333
IT SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO BE

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.035
ELIGIBLE FOR CERTAIN SENTENCE

01:47:22.102 --> 01:47:22.969
IN THE MEDICARE MEDICAID

01:47:23.036 --> 01:47:24.871
PROGRAM. SO A LOT OF THE

01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:26.306
REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN BOTH

01:47:26.373 --> 01:47:28.575
THE CMS RULE IN THE ONC RULE

01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:32.512
REALLY GETTING AT A COMBINATION

01:47:32.579 --> 01:47:32.979
OF STAKEHOLDERS IN THE

01:47:33.046 --> 01:47:37.684
HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY NEXT LIKE.

01:47:37.751 --> 01:47:40.353
SO WHAT WHAT DO THE REGULATIONS

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:42.489
DUE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

01:47:42.556 --> 01:47:44.391
PATIENTS PROVIDERS HEALTH PLANS

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:46.860
TO SHARE ACCESS SHARE AND USE

01:47:46.927 --> 01:47:49.429
HEALTHCARE DATA. THE

01:47:49.496 --> 01:47:50.864
REGULATIONS AGAIN THERE'S A LOT

01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:51.731
OF AND I CAN I'M NOT GOING TO

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:52.799
COVER ALL OF THEM BUT I THINK

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:54.301
THE THREE MAIN ONES TEND TO

01:47:54.367 --> 01:47:56.703
KNOW ABOUT AND BE AWARE OF AS

01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:58.138
THE STATE SO CONTEMPLATES

01:47:58.205 --> 01:48:00.473
THESE- YOU KNOW. HEALTH DATA

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:03.410
EXCHANGE OPTIONS IS THREE THAT

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:03.977
THAT ARE COVERED IN IN THE

01:48:04.044 --> 01:48:08.148
REGULATION THE SUN'S LIGHT FOR

01:48:08.215 --> 01:48:10.851
THAT THE THREE ARE. ONE DATA

01:48:10.917 --> 01:48:12.118
EXCHANGE THEY ARE REQUIRING

01:48:12.185 --> 01:48:15.755
VERY SPECIFIC- ENTITIES TO

01:48:15.822 --> 01:48:18.959
SHARE DATA CERTAIN DATA WITH.

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:19.459
EACH OTHER UNDER CERTAIN

01:48:19.526 --> 01:48:22.329
CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ARE ALSO

01:48:22.395 --> 01:48:24.431
WHEN DATA IS BEING EXCHANGED-

01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:25.599
THEY ARE PUTTING IN PLACE

01:48:25.665 --> 01:48:27.100
REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THOSE TWO

01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:28.535
ENTITIES THE ORGANIZATION THAT

01:48:28.602 --> 01:48:30.303
IS SENDING THE DATA AND THE

01:48:30.370 --> 01:48:31.438
ORGANIZATION THAT'S RECEIVING

01:48:31.504 --> 01:48:33.373
THE DATA THEY CAN DO THAT IN A

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.909
VERY SEAMLESS WAY. ON SO THAT

01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:37.811
WITHOUT A LOT OF EFFORT AND

01:48:37.878 --> 01:48:39.346
CURRENT STATE SOMETIMES YOU

01:48:39.412 --> 01:48:40.513
KNOW GETTING DATA FROM ANOTHER

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:42.482
SYSTEM CAN TAKE MONTHS OF JUST

01:48:42.549 --> 01:48:44.885
IMPLEMENTATION WORK. THE THIRD

01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:45.819
ONE WHICH I'M NOT GONNA SPEND

01:48:45.886 --> 01:48:47.721
TOO MUCH TIME ON BUT IS A BIG.

01:48:47.787 --> 01:48:49.890
PART OF THE REGULATION IS-

01:48:49.956 --> 01:48:51.024
RELATING TO INFORMATION

01:48:51.091 --> 01:48:53.827
BLOCKING WHERE. CMS AND ONC ARE

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:55.795
ESSENTIALLY PREVENTING. OUR

01:48:55.862 --> 01:48:58.064
PROVIDERS AND VENDORS OF HEALTH

01:48:58.131 --> 01:49:02.669
SYSTEMS- TO- NOT BLOCK- PATIENT

01:49:02.736 --> 01:49:04.104
OR PROVIDER REQUESTS FOR

01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:05.038
HEALTHCARE INFORMATION SO

01:49:05.105 --> 01:49:06.206
THERE'S A NUMBER OF DEFINITIONS

01:49:06.273 --> 01:49:10.010
AND EXEMPTIONS. TO IT BUT A SAN

01:49:10.076 --> 01:49:11.611
IF THERE IS A DATA EXCHANGE AND

01:49:11.678 --> 01:49:13.947
ANIONS BEING REQUESTED THAT

01:49:14.014 --> 01:49:15.882
THEY CAN BE SUPPORTED. SOMEONE

01:49:15.949 --> 01:49:17.384
SPEND MY TIME ON THE NOTION OF

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:18.618
DATA EXCHANGE AND AN

01:49:18.685 --> 01:49:20.887
IMPROBABILITY WHERE IT'S EASY

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:21.855
FOR TWO SYSTEMS WHO DON'T KNOW

01:49:21.922 --> 01:49:24.090
EACH OTHER. MY PRIOR EXPERIENCE

01:49:24.157 --> 01:49:25.825
TO CONNECT AND SHARE THAT DATA.

01:49:25.892 --> 01:49:27.060
SO THERE'S FIVE TEAMS I KIND OF

01:49:27.127 --> 01:49:28.962
COME OUT AND I AND I THINK FOR

01:49:29.029 --> 01:49:31.564
THE TAKE AWAY FOR. AND

01:49:31.631 --> 01:49:33.566
LEGISLATOR AND THE AUDIENCE- I

01:49:33.633 --> 01:49:35.035
THINK AS YOU APPROACH THIS

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:36.736
DISCUSSION IS THE APPROACH THAT

01:49:36.803 --> 01:49:37.671
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:44.611
USED. WHICH. THE CONSUMERS

01:49:44.678 --> 01:49:46.313
ACTUALLY AT THE CENTER OF THIS

01:49:46.379 --> 01:49:48.682
HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE.

01:49:48.748 --> 01:49:49.849
THEY ARE MANDATING

01:49:49.916 --> 01:49:51.418
PARTICIPATION FROM THE

01:49:51.484 --> 01:49:53.086
STAKEHOLDERS THAT THEY CAN

01:49:53.153 --> 01:49:55.021
REGULATE SO IT'S NOT VOLUNTARY.

01:49:55.088 --> 01:49:58.758
ANDFOR DATA IN A ROCKET BILITY

01:49:58.825 --> 01:50:00.293
THEY ARE IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.929
COMMON STANDARDS AND THE USE OF

01:50:02.996 --> 01:50:05.899
A CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES SOMEONE

01:50:05.966 --> 01:50:07.500
OF EACH OF THOSE NEXT. SO NEXT

01:50:07.567 --> 01:50:10.870
LIGHT SO AND I THINK AN EASY

01:50:10.937 --> 01:50:14.174
WAY TO HELP EXPLAIN WHAT. IS

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:17.377
THIS IN A RAPIDLY RULE IS TO GO

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:17.978
OVER USE CASE AND TAKE IT FROM

01:50:18.044 --> 01:50:21.014
THE USER PERSPECTIVE. SO IF I

01:50:21.081 --> 01:50:23.750
ASKED YOU- IF YOU WENT TO YOUR

01:50:23.817 --> 01:50:24.517
PROVIDER YOUR HEALTH PLAN AND

01:50:24.584 --> 01:50:28.955
ASK THEM. I'D LIKE A COPY OF MY

INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE ON.

01:50:30.056 --> 01:50:31.891
THE RESPONSE YOU TYPICALLY WILL

GET TODAY IS THE MAY GIVE YOU A

PRINT OUT. THAT IS PRETTY

01:50:35.328 --> 01:50:36.730
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND OR PDF

01:50:36.796 --> 01:50:39.232
VERSION OF THAT PRINT OUT THEY

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:41.067
MAY GIVE YOU EVEN A CD OR USB

01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:42.002
DRIVE WITH ALL THAT

01:50:42.068 --> 01:50:44.571
INFORMATION. AND IN SOME CASES

01:50:44.637 --> 01:50:47.273
THEY WILL- DIRECT YOU TO AN

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:48.241
ONLINE PORTAL THAT THEY HAD

01:50:48.308 --> 01:50:49.409
THAT YOU CAN SIGN INTO AND HAS

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:50.477

WHAT WITH THAT HEALTH PLAN.

01:50:54.447 --> 01:50:55.482
WHAT THE REGULATION IS ACTUALLY

01:50:55.548 --> 01:50:57.317
GETTING OUT IS ENABLING THE

01:50:57.384 --> 01:50:59.552
ABILITY SO THE FOR THE FUTURE

01:50:59.619 --> 01:51:01.921
IS THAT ANY CONSUMER PATIENT

01:51:01.988 --> 01:51:04.224
HAS THE BILL TO ACCESS ALL

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:04.858
THEIR HEALTH INFORMATION IN ONE

01:51:04.924 --> 01:51:06.960
PLACE. IN THAT ONE PLACE IS

01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:09.029
ESSENTIALLY THE SMARTPHONE. IT

01:51:09.095 --> 01:51:11.831
IS A MOBILE PHONE. N. THAT

01:51:11.898 --> 01:51:14.134
MEANS PROVIDERS AND OR HEALTH

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.735
PLANS WE HAVE INFORMATION ON A

01:51:15.802 --> 01:51:17.704
CONSUMER PATIENT. IF THAT

01:51:17.771 --> 01:51:19.439
CONSUMER DOWNLOAD AN APP ON

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:22.275
THEIR PHONE TELLS THAT APT. TO

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:25.011
REQUEST THAT INFORMATION FROM

01:51:25.078 --> 01:51:25.612
THE HEALTH PLAN OR HEALTH CARE

PROVIDER. THAT REQUEST AFTER

01:51:28.481 --> 01:51:30.483
CONSENT IS CONFIRMED THAT THOSE

WILL SEND THAT INFORMATION. TO

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:35.889
THAT THIRD PARTY APPS IN THE

01:51:35.955 --> 01:51:37.791
CONSUMER THEN ESSENTIALLY THE

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:39.359
USE CASE THAT IS THAT IS BEING

01:51:39.426 --> 01:51:41.027
OFFERED IS THEY WILL GOAL TO

01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:42.929
THEIR PROVIDER OR DOCTOR DOING

HEALTH CARE VISITS SO THAT IS

01:51:54.741 --> 01:51:56.976
THE SPECIFIC USE CASE. THAT IS

01:51:57.043 --> 01:51:59.813
BEING SUPPORTED BY THE FEDERAL

01:51:59.879 --> 01:52:02.048
REGULATIONS. AND THAT'S BOTH A

01:52:02.115 --> 01:52:03.750
HOLISTIC VIEW FROM ANY PROVIDER

01:52:03.817 --> 01:52:05.819
ANY HEALTH HAZARDS LIKE GNOSTIC

AND HAS ALLOWED ME TO NO RECORD

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:08.688
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN

HAVE OVER MANY YEARS YOU KNOW

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:11.758

THE TARGET IS ON THE SMARTPHONE.

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:24.437

IT'S THE PERSON IN THE MOBILE

01:52:45.825 --> 01:52:47.527
PHONE THAT'S THE CENTER OF THE

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:49.262
MODEL WHERE ALL THE DATA

01:52:49.329 --> 01:52:50.430

01:55:39.299 --> 01:55:40.566
PATIENT AND GO TO HOSPITAL. THE

01:55:40.633 --> 01:55:43.036
HOSPITAL THAN NOTIFY PCPS AND

01:55:43.102 --> 01:55:45.104
OTHER FACILITIES IN THE

01:55:45.171 --> 01:55:47.740
COMMUNITY. OF AN ER VISIT- IF

01:55:47.807 --> 01:55:48.441
THERE'S AN ADMISSION TO THE

01:55:48.508 --> 01:55:50.877
HOSPITAL- THAT PATIENT HAS BEEN

01:55:50.943 --> 01:55:52.779
DISCHARGED THE COMMUNITY. OR

01:55:52.845 --> 01:55:54.414
TRANSFER TO ANOTHER FACILITY SO

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:55.782
THIS IS A LOT OF HOSPITALS DO

01:55:55.848 --> 01:55:57.617
THIS TODAY- BUT THIS WILL

01:55:57.684 --> 01:55:58.718
REQUIRE OF ALL HOSPITALS IN

01:55:58.785 --> 01:56:00.186
THIS WILL BE A REQUIREMENT OF

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:01.688
MEDICARE PARTICIPATION SO THAT

01:56:01.754 --> 01:56:02.855
ENSURES ESSENTIALLY MORE ALMOST

01:56:02.922 --> 01:56:05.958
ALL. HOSPITALS ARE

01:56:06.025 --> 01:56:06.926
PARTICIPATING THIS. SO THAT

01:56:06.993 --> 01:56:08.594
THAT COVERS THE USE CASES IN

01:56:08.661 --> 01:56:10.530
THE IN THE- REGULATION SOME OF

01:56:10.596 --> 01:56:11.297
THE DATA THAT'S BEING.

01:56:11.364 --> 01:56:12.932
TRANSFERRED BETWEEN ENTITIES

01:56:12.999 --> 01:56:15.201
AND BY THE CONSENT IS REQUIRED

01:56:15.268 --> 01:56:18.838
OR NOT. OUR NEXT FLIGHT. I JUST

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:20.807
WANT TO COVER VERY BRIEFLY SO

01:56:20.873 --> 01:56:21.741
TO TECHNICAL COMPONENTS THAT

01:56:21.808 --> 01:56:23.142
GET THIS NOTION OF INTEROP AND

01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:24.711
W. WHERE TWO SYSTEMS CAN DO

01:56:24.777 --> 01:56:29.148
THIS VERY EASILY- ONE IS- THE

01:56:29.215 --> 01:56:31.184
CORE DATA THAT IS BEING THE

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:33.419
MINIMUM DATA THAT IS BEING

01:56:33.486 --> 01:56:35.221
SUPPORTED IN MAKING AVAILABLE

01:56:35.288 --> 01:56:37.256
IS DATA THAT FITS INTO WHAT'S

01:56:37.323 --> 01:56:39.392
CALLED THE U. S. CPI DATA

01:56:39.459 --> 01:56:40.993
CLASSIFICATION AGAIN THAT'S U.

01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:42.428
S. COURT DATE IN A LOP ABILITY

01:56:42.495 --> 01:56:44.964
VERSION ONE. AND ALL YOU REALLY

01:56:45.031 --> 01:56:46.966
NEED TO KNOW IS THAT IT'S

01:56:47.033 --> 01:56:49.335
SIXTEEN DATA CLASSES IN FIFTEEN

01:56:49.402 --> 01:56:50.436
TO DATA ELEMENTS AND I KIND OF

01:56:50.503 --> 01:56:53.740
JUST LIFTED IT LISTED HERE THE

01:56:53.806 --> 01:56:54.774
VISUAL IF YOU CAN SEE IT THAT'S

01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:56.175
GOT SOME STANDARD INFORMATION

01:56:56.242 --> 01:56:57.710
LIKE PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC

01:56:57.777 --> 01:56:59.479

01:56:59.545 --> 01:57:02.248
IMMUNIZATIONS LABS MEDICATIONS

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:04.550
AND CLINICAL COMPONENTS SUCH AS

01:57:04.617 --> 01:57:06.986
YOU KNOW DIFFERENT VITAL SIGNS-

01:57:07.053 --> 01:57:09.889
ALLERGIES AND SO FORTH. SO THIS

01:57:09.956 --> 01:57:10.990
IS THE MINIMUM THAT WE KNOW

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:12.525
HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS IF

01:57:12.592 --> 01:57:14.127
THEY HAVE IT IN THEIR SYSTEM IN

01:57:14.193 --> 01:57:17.363
A IN A PATIENT REQUESTED. THEY

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:18.931
MUST MAKE OUT OF TO ANY THIRD

01:57:18.998 --> 01:57:19.565
PARTY OUT THAT THAT THE

01:57:19.632 --> 01:57:22.168
CONSUMER CHOOSES. NOW THERE'S

01:57:22.235 --> 01:57:23.636
CONSISTENCY IN A MINIMUM FLOOR

01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:25.638
THIS IS NOT ALL DATA THAT'S

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:26.906
AVAILABLE IN CLINICAL SYSTEMS

01:57:26.973 --> 01:57:27.907
BUT THIS IS THE MINIMUM THAT

01:57:27.974 --> 01:57:29.108
EVERYONE IS BUILDING

01:57:29.175 --> 01:57:31.010
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT. I

01:57:31.077 --> 01:57:34.614
NEXT LIGHT. SO IN ADDITION TO

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.749
THIS THIS FOUNDATION FOR DATA I

01:57:36.816 --> 01:57:39.318
JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE IS

01:57:39.385 --> 01:57:41.020
JUST REALLY BRIEFLY- THREE

01:57:41.087 --> 01:57:42.855
OTHER TECHNICAL STANDARDS- THAT

01:57:42.922 --> 01:57:44.357
IT BECOMES THE BASIS THAT NOW

01:57:44.424 --> 01:57:45.858
AGAIN NOW PLANS PROVIDERS IN

01:57:45.925 --> 01:57:47.827
THESE HEALTH IT SYSTEMS WILL BE

01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:49.729
BUILDING SUPPORT FOR AND

01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:51.831
SOMETHING THAT THE STATE AS WE

01:57:51.898 --> 01:57:52.432
THINK THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF

01:57:52.498 --> 01:57:55.168
THE HOW. AT TO GET PAST SOME OF

01:57:55.234 --> 01:58:00.440
THE USE CASES IS THAT A BIG

01:58:00.506 --> 01:58:00.973
PORTION OF OUR HEALTHCARE

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:01.607
INDUSTRY NOW WILL BE SUPPORTING

01:58:01.674 --> 01:58:03.943
EMBARRASSED DATA FORMAT AND A

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:05.445
SPECIFIC WAY TO COMMUNICATE

01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:08.781
THROUGH- TO ORGANIZATIONS NOW

01:58:08.848 --> 01:58:10.349
FOR MENISCAL FIRE A VERSION

01:58:10.416 --> 01:58:13.653
FOR- AND THEN IN ADDITION TO

01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:15.555
THIS TO FOUNDATIONS FOR

01:58:15.621 --> 01:58:17.156

THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS. SO AS

01:58:26.165 --> 01:58:28.100
THE STATE THINKS ABOUT THEIR

01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:29.802
OWN OPTIONS THESE ARE YOU KNOW

01:58:29.869 --> 01:58:31.671

NOT EASILY REPLICATE FOR

01:58:38.978 --> 01:58:40.546
FILLING SOME GAPS AND- THAT IS

01:58:40.613 --> 01:58:41.848
STILL. OUT THERE FROM THE OF

HOPEFULLY I ALREADY MENTIONED

02:02:01.781 --> 02:02:03.783
DURING MY PRESENTATION IT'S A

02:02:03.849 --> 02:02:05.751
PRETTY BIG LEAGUE FORD FORD-

DATA AVAILABILITY DATA SHARING

02:02:07.687 --> 02:02:09.755
AND IT'S REALLY IT'S CONSUMER.

02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:11.223
ORIENTED SO HOPEFULLY THAT THAT

02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:12.792
WILL DRIVE CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT

02:02:12.858 --> 02:02:14.226
BUT WILL SUPPORT CLINICAL CARE

02:02:14.293 --> 02:02:16.162

02:02:16.228 --> 02:02:17.229
THESE ARE JUST MINIMUM

02:02:17.296 --> 02:02:19.832
REQUIREMENTS SO THAT IT REALLY

02:02:19.899 --> 02:02:20.433
JUST SETS THE FLOOR NOT THE C.

02:02:20.499 --> 02:02:21.467

COMING FORWARD- YOU KNOW MY

02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:40.019
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THERE'S

02:02:40.086 --> 02:02:41.020
A SOLID FOUNDATION THAT'S BEEN

02:02:41.087 --> 02:02:43.322
DEALT THROUGH THE FEDERAL

02:02:43.389 --> 02:02:44.156
APPROACH AND THAT IS SOMETHING

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:45.791
THAT THE STATE CAN. CAN

02:02:45.858 --> 02:02:47.326
LEVERAGE AND LEASING FORMS AND

02:02:47.393 --> 02:02:48.761
THE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE

02:02:48.828 --> 02:02:50.596
SPECIFICALLY THE USE CASES. ARE

02:02:50.663 --> 02:02:53.466
MANDATING PARTICIPATION AND-

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:54.333
SOME OF THE COMMON STANDARDS

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:56.001
AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE READY

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:58.337
SORT OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE

02:02:58.404 --> 02:03:01.273
FEDERAL REGULATIONS. THAT'S ALL

02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:07.580
I HAD FOR MINE- ARE THERE ANY

02:03:07.646 --> 02:03:08.214
QUESTIONS. WHILE THANK YOU VERY

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.216
THAT'S THE AND IT'S KINDA SHEDS

02:03:10.282 --> 02:03:13.619
A WHOLE NEW LIGHT ON THE ON THE

02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:16.455
WAY THIS IS INTO TO OPERATE SO.

02:03:16.522 --> 02:03:17.823
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY A

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:19.592
QUESTIONS. DO YOU HAVE ANY

02:03:19.658 --> 02:03:22.328
QUESTIONS FROM THE REMOTE. NO

02:03:22.394 --> 02:03:25.030
QUESTIONS FROM REMOTE SO I HAVE

02:03:25.097 --> 02:03:27.233
A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND SO-

02:03:27.299 --> 02:03:28.701
FIRST WHY I APPRECIATE THE

02:03:28.768 --> 02:03:30.636
REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR

02:03:30.703 --> 02:03:32.271
PRESENTATION AND LIKE I SAID IT

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:33.639
DOES SHED A DIFFERENT LIGHT ON

02:03:33.706 --> 02:03:37.042
THINGS- THAT I THAT I WAS NOT

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:40.579
AWARE OF SO- ARE THERE YOU KNOW

02:03:40.646 --> 02:03:42.014
WHAT ARE OR THEY'RE GONNA BE

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:43.415
DIFFERENCES IN WHAT ARE. YOU

02:03:43.482 --> 02:03:45.184
KNOW THE ART WITH DCS AND

02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:46.519
MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE

02:03:46.585 --> 02:03:47.686
GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO DO

02:03:47.753 --> 02:03:50.289
DIFFERENTLY- OF IT AND MADE

02:03:50.356 --> 02:03:55.828
OTHER SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES.

02:03:55.895 --> 02:03:57.229
PROBABLY MORE SIMILARITIES AND

02:03:57.296 --> 02:03:58.998
DIFFERENCES AND GETTING INTO A

02:03:59.064 --> 02:04:00.599
LOT OF THE NEW ONES BUT- THE

02:04:00.666 --> 02:04:03.002
MAIN IS THE SIMILARITY OF-

02:04:03.068 --> 02:04:05.371
ACCESS. I JUST THIRD PARTY

02:04:05.437 --> 02:04:07.773
APPS- BASED ON CONSUMER CONSENT

02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:10.976
THAT ONE IS THE SAME- THE END.

02:04:11.043 --> 02:04:12.144
THE PROVIDER DIRECTORY

02:04:12.211 --> 02:04:13.913
INFORMATION. THE DIFFERENCE IS

02:04:13.979 --> 02:04:15.981
THAT ON THAT PAID A PAY DATA

02:04:16.048 --> 02:04:17.316
EXCHANGE WHERE MEMBERS INVOLVED

02:04:17.383 --> 02:04:18.818
IN A NEW PLAN THAT'S ONLY

02:04:18.884 --> 02:04:20.753
REQUIRED OF- MANAGED CARE

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:21.253
ORGANIZATIONS IT IS NOT

02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:22.888
REQUIRED IN THE STATE. AGAIN

02:04:22.955 --> 02:04:24.356
THAT'S THE FLOOR THAT DOESN'T

02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:25.825
MEAN THROUGH STATE POLICY AND

02:04:25.891 --> 02:04:27.660
DISCUSSIONS THAT. AND NUMBER

02:04:27.726 --> 02:04:29.028
WHO MOVES FROM STATE PEOPLE

02:04:29.094 --> 02:04:30.796
SERVICE INTO A MEDIC CAL

02:04:30.863 --> 02:04:31.463
MANAGED CARE PLAN THAT THAT

02:04:31.530 --> 02:04:33.132
COULD BE. WEIGHED UP MAYBE

02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:35.100
CLOSE A LITTLE BIT OF A GAP

02:04:35.167 --> 02:04:36.869
THAT'S IN THE REQUIREMENTS- I

02:04:36.936 --> 02:04:39.238
KNOW OUR- HEALTH PLANS AND IN

02:04:39.305 --> 02:04:40.606
THE STATE YOU KNOW THAT'S OPEN

02:04:40.673 --> 02:04:41.407
FOR DISCUSSION BUT THAT'S

02:04:41.473 --> 02:04:45.778
TECHNICALLY NOT REQUIRED OF. PH

02:04:45.845 --> 02:04:47.580
CS TO SUPPORT THAT. GREAT N.

02:04:47.646 --> 02:04:48.848
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WITH THIS

02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:51.150
BEING. AN ANIMATOR DIFFERENCES.

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:54.253
OKAY OBVIOUSLY WITH THIS BEING

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.521
YOU KNOW CONSUMER DIRECT GO

02:04:55.588 --> 02:05:00.693
HEAD. WITH ABSENT WITH AN APP

02:05:00.759 --> 02:05:02.428
HOW HOW DOES THIS IS HOW HOW WE

02:05:02.494 --> 02:05:03.596
HOW DO WE DRESS LIKE OLDER

02:05:03.662 --> 02:05:05.331
PATIENTS WHO MAY NOT BE TECH

02:05:05.397 --> 02:05:07.766
TECHNOLOGY SAVVY- IN IN MY

02:05:07.833 --> 02:05:08.934
DISTRICT I GET MISS

02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:11.237
AGUIAR-CURRY IS DISTRICT WE

02:05:11.303 --> 02:05:13.505
LACKED IN MANY AREAS WE LACKS

02:05:13.572 --> 02:05:15.040
CELL PHONE SERVICE WE LACK

02:05:15.107 --> 02:05:19.178
BROADBAND AND SO. HELP ME

02:05:19.245 --> 02:05:20.646
UNDERSTAND HOW THAT HELPS OUR

02:05:20.713 --> 02:05:22.748
OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:24.583
HAVE THESE KINDS OF

02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:30.022
INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. YES

02:05:30.089 --> 02:05:32.558
TWO QUESTIONS THERE IS- SORT OF

02:05:32.625 --> 02:05:34.827
TECH SAVVY AND I THINK THAT IS

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:36.996
ONE ISSUES THAT WITH THAT WILL

02:05:37.062 --> 02:05:39.164
COME UP OF. HOW WELL DO WE

02:05:39.231 --> 02:05:41.700
THINK THE ADOPTION WILL BE. N.

02:05:41.767 --> 02:05:43.836
I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THE THIS

02:05:43.903 --> 02:05:45.204
REGULATION ABOUT ACCESS TO

02:05:45.271 --> 02:05:46.872
THIRD PARTY APPS AND CONSUMER

02:05:46.939 --> 02:05:49.008
ENGAGEMENT IT'S BUILT ACTUALLY

02:05:49.074 --> 02:05:51.510
OFF OF WHAT CMS HAS DONE FOR

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:53.145
MANY YEARS FOR MEDICARE FEE FOR

02:05:53.212 --> 02:05:57.016
SERVICE AND THEY HAVE FIFTY

02:05:57.082 --> 02:05:57.750
FIVE APPS ACTUALLY IN

02:05:57.816 --> 02:05:59.551
PRODUCTION THAT ACTUALLY ARE

02:05:59.618 --> 02:06:00.686
READY SUPPORTING THIS KIND OF

02:06:00.753 --> 02:06:03.022
FUNCTIONALITY. THEY DON'T HAVE-

02:06:03.088 --> 02:06:05.090
A LOT FROM WHAT I CAN TELL AND

02:06:05.157 --> 02:06:06.425
TALKING TO SOME OF THE APPS

02:06:06.492 --> 02:06:07.960
THAT ARE AVAILABLE- HIGH USAGE

02:06:08.027 --> 02:06:08.894
I THINK SOME ADDITION FROM

02:06:08.961 --> 02:06:11.730
AWARENESS. BUT I THINK THERE IS

02:06:11.797 --> 02:06:13.799
AN ASSUMPTION THAT PEOPLE STILL

02:06:13.866 --> 02:06:15.200
RELY ON THE PHONE AND IF IT'S

02:06:15.267 --> 02:06:16.969
NOT THEM THEMSELVES. A BIG

02:06:17.036 --> 02:06:18.604
BENEFIT OF THIS OPPORTUNITIES

02:06:18.671 --> 02:06:20.706
ACTUALLY NOT THE INDIVIDUAL

02:06:20.773 --> 02:06:21.707
CONSUMER BUT IN MANY CASES IS

02:06:21.774 --> 02:06:23.442
ACTUALLY THE FAMILY AND IN THE

02:06:23.509 --> 02:06:25.077
CARE GIVER WHO CAN HAVE ACCESS

02:06:25.144 --> 02:06:26.412
TO THIS INFORMATION AGAIN IF WE

02:06:26.478 --> 02:06:27.479
LOOK AT THE USE CASE BEFORE AND

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:29.648
AFTER MANY TIMES. IT'S PAPER

02:06:29.715 --> 02:06:31.350
DRIVEN FOR ITS INCOMPLETE

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:33.052
HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT ON THE

02:06:33.118 --> 02:06:34.453
ONE THAT THEY'RE CARING FOR AND

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:36.488
THIS CASE- IT BE CENTRALIZED IN

02:06:36.555 --> 02:06:37.389
THE PHONE AND EVEN THE CARE

02:06:37.456 --> 02:06:38.958
GIVER. BECAUSE IT COULD BE

02:06:39.024 --> 02:06:42.728
GRANTED ACCESS. CAN HAVE ALL

02:06:42.795 --> 02:06:43.329
THAT INFORMATION ON THE PHONE.

02:06:43.395 --> 02:06:43.829
SO IT'S NOT JUST IN THE

02:06:43.896 --> 02:06:45.531
CONSUMER THEY CAN GRANT ACCESS

02:06:45.597 --> 02:06:49.835
TO A PROXY- THE TO SOMEONE ELSE.

02:06:49.902 --> 02:06:51.303
THAT'S ASSUMING THEY HAVE SELF

02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:53.005
RICH. THE LACK OF CELL PHONE

02:06:53.072 --> 02:06:54.573
BROADBAND AND I THINK THAT

02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:55.074
THAT'S GONNA BE A COMMON

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.508
CHALLENGE AS WELL FOR SOME

02:06:56.575 --> 02:06:59.578
CONSUMERS- BUT- AND AGAIN I

02:06:59.645 --> 02:07:00.379
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:01.613
BE PLAN HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:05.951
THAT THAT CAN BE DONE. IN AN

02:07:06.018 --> 02:07:06.552
EXAMPLE I GIVE PEOPLE IS THERE

02:07:06.618 --> 02:07:07.419
IS AN AL ON APPLE APPLE HEALTH

02:07:07.486 --> 02:07:08.387
APP THAT ESSENTIALLY DOES IS

02:07:08.454 --> 02:07:11.190
NOW YOU CAN LOOK AT. PROVIDERS

02:07:11.256 --> 02:07:12.391
WHO ARE PARTICIPATING WITH

02:07:12.458 --> 02:07:13.692
APPLE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD YOUR

02:07:13.759 --> 02:07:15.661
HISTORY I DOWNLOAD MY SUTTER.

02:07:15.728 --> 02:07:17.396
HISTORY AND STANFORD IN A

02:07:17.463 --> 02:07:19.198
DOWNLOADING FIFTEEN SECONDS-

02:07:19.264 --> 02:07:20.299
AND I THINK THAT'S THE BEAUTY

02:07:20.366 --> 02:07:21.633
OF USING SOME OF THE MODERN

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:22.701
TECHNOLOGIES THAT THEY'RE

02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:25.004
REQUIRING. IT'S THAT IT'S

02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:27.506
REALLY A SMALL PACKET OF DATA.

02:07:27.573 --> 02:07:29.541
AND IT'S AT THE CONSUMER LEVEL.

02:07:29.608 --> 02:07:31.677
AND THAT'S THE THEORY BEHIND IT

02:07:31.744 --> 02:07:32.177
IS THAT IT WOULD BE MORE

02:07:32.244 --> 02:07:34.747
ACCESSIBLE- IT DOESN'T TAKE.

02:07:34.813 --> 02:07:36.215
LIKE STRONG SO YOU KNOW SELL

02:07:36.281 --> 02:07:40.185
WERE BROADBAND- POWER TO. TO

02:07:40.252 --> 02:07:40.786
GET THAT INFORMATION INTO YOUR

02:07:40.853 --> 02:07:42.921
CELL PHONE. SO I MEAN THIS IS A

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:43.789
KIND OF A NUTS AND BOLTS

02:07:43.856 --> 02:07:45.190
QUESTION SO I'M JUST TRYING TO-

02:07:45.257 --> 02:07:47.059
JUST TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND SO AS

02:07:47.126 --> 02:07:49.428
THE CONSUMER. WHO'S GOING TO

02:07:49.495 --> 02:07:52.164
ACCESS THIS APP. SOMEWHERE OUT

02:07:52.231 --> 02:07:57.469
THERE IN IN THE WORLD OF DATA.

02:07:57.536 --> 02:08:00.406
THERE'S A HEALTH INFORMATION-

02:08:00.472 --> 02:08:02.574
EXCHANGE THAT RECOGNIZES THAT

02:08:02.641 --> 02:08:03.909
PATIENT AND THEN AND THEN

02:08:03.976 --> 02:08:06.378
SUPPLIES THE DATA IS THAT A

02:08:06.445 --> 02:08:12.785
FAIR ASSUMPTION. WAGEWORKS

02:08:12.851 --> 02:08:15.287
WOULD BE- THE CONSUMER

02:08:15.354 --> 02:08:18.557
DOWNLOADS THE APT THE APP THEN

02:08:18.624 --> 02:08:19.725
WOULD HAVE TO MAKE DIFFERENT

02:08:19.792 --> 02:08:21.860
CONNECTIONS TO PROVIDERS AND

02:08:21.927 --> 02:08:23.128
HEALTH PLANS SO THEY HAVE

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:25.464
ACCESS AND IF THE WORD E. TO

02:08:25.531 --> 02:08:28.434
REQUEST. DATA SO THAT THAT AB

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:30.803
IS ACTUALLY TALKING DIRECTLY TO

02:08:30.869 --> 02:08:32.638
A HEALTH PLAN FOR A HEALTH CARE

02:08:32.704 --> 02:08:35.574
HEALTH PROVIDERS EHR SYSTEMS.

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:36.575
AND THEN WHEN THEY MAKE THAT

02:08:36.642 --> 02:08:41.013
REQUEST THEY'RE SAYING HEY. I'M

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:41.580
MAKING REQUEST ON BEHALF OF

02:08:41.647 --> 02:08:42.214
THIS PERSON. THE H. R. SYSTEMS

02:08:42.281 --> 02:08:43.816
HOW PLAN SYSTEMS OR SAY YES

02:08:43.882 --> 02:08:45.284
THAT'S A MEMBER THAT SOME WE

02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:46.552
HAVE DATA ON AND THEN THEY

02:08:46.618 --> 02:08:48.253
WOULD SEND THAT ACROSS. IT'S

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:49.855
NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTED AT

02:08:49.922 --> 02:08:51.657

02:24:40.972 --> 02:24:42.073
BOTH LIKE THEY ARE HYBRID

02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:43.775
THERE'S OF BOTH BUT A MOST

02:24:43.841 --> 02:24:47.045
CENTER. I THINK FOR THE DAY

02:24:47.111 --> 02:24:49.680
SERVICE. THAT DATA. ARE JUST

02:24:49.747 --> 02:24:51.449
EASIER TO LAW WITH CENTRAL

02:24:53.151 --> 02:24:56.020
DATA HOSPITAL THAT MORE LIKELY

02:24:56.087 --> 02:25:02.660
TO BE DONE. DECENTRALIZED. I

02:25:02.727 --> 02:25:03.294
HAD ONE LAST WHY WHICH IS THE

02:25:03.361 --> 02:25:05.997
PITFALLS I BEEN. IN OTHER STATE

02:25:06.064 --> 02:25:09.133
NINE LIKE TO CALL OUT AND SHIPS

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:13.037
WENT MULTIPLE VICTIM BE. I'VE

02:25:13.104 --> 02:25:14.405
BEEN IN OTHER STATES WHERE THAT

02:25:14.472 --> 02:25:17.208
ARE TRYING TO BUILD- AND H. I.

02:25:17.275 --> 02:25:19.944
O. SOMEONE WILL POINT OUT NO

02:25:20.011 --> 02:25:20.945
THE DOCTOR ALREADY GET RECORDS

02:25:21.012 --> 02:25:23.414
FROM THE HOSPITAL ACROSS TOWN.

02:25:23.481 --> 02:25:26.217
AND THEY'LL BE CLEAR THAT THE

02:25:26.284 --> 02:25:28.086
WHOLE PROBLEM IT'S ALL. BUT IT

02:25:28.152 --> 02:25:29.720
REALLY IS THAT ASSEMBLY MOVING

02:25:29.787 --> 02:25:32.356
DATA- AND YOU MIGHT BE WITH THE

02:25:32.423 --> 02:25:34.859
NATIONAL NETWORK IT MAYBE A 25%

02:25:34.926 --> 02:25:37.528

02:25:37.595 --> 02:25:40.098
H. I. L. H. I. WILL DO A MUCH

02:25:40.164 --> 02:25:43.401
MUCH MORE. THAN THAT. OKAY

02:25:43.468 --> 02:25:46.704
SECOND BULLET. IS THAT THE IN

02:25:46.771 --> 02:25:48.840
MY EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY WITH

BUNCH OF EXISTING H. I. OPEN

02:25:53.077 --> 02:25:55.213
TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE

02:25:55.279 --> 02:25:56.881
THAT BY MAKING A NETWORK OF

SOMETIMES THE TVA. AND IF THAT

02:31:31.215 --> 02:31:33.083
IT'S A STRUCTURED ELECTRONIC

02:31:33.150 --> 02:31:35.786
DOCUMENTS THAT ALLOW THE H. R.

FAR END. AND THERE'S A CERTAIN

02:31:47.198 --> 02:31:49.166
SOPHISTICATION OF THAT. WHAT WE

02:31:49.233 --> 02:31:52.002
FOUND IS THAT. WHAT CLINICIANS

02:31:52.069 --> 02:31:54.638
USE FROM CRAP THE MOLD. AND

02:31:54.705 --> 02:31:56.607

THOSE WERE WHICH WE'VE REPEATED

02:32:00.411 --> 02:32:03.614
SOME OTHER WAY. SO WE MIGHT

02:32:03.681 --> 02:32:06.717

THAT WE DO IS. IN CERTAIN

02:32:18.262 --> 02:32:20.130
HOSPITALS THAT THE POSITION IS

02:32:20.197 --> 02:32:22.800

02:32:29.807 --> 02:32:31.008
THAT THAT A PATIENT MIGHT HAVE

02:32:31.075 --> 02:32:34.812
EXPERIENCE. SO THE WORD

02:32:34.879 --> 02:32:36.780
DEFENDING BETTER THAN FORMATION

02:32:36.847 --> 02:32:38.516

USE CASES AS- A REPUBLICAN A

02:34:34.898 --> 02:34:35.766
REDUCTION IN YOU KNOW

02:34:35.833 --> 02:34:38.202
DUPLICATIVE LAB WORK OR IMAGING

02:34:43.374 --> 02:34:44.575
LOOKING FOR IS ANYONE

02:34:44.642 --> 02:34:47.378
QUANTIFIED WHAT IT COSTS TO

02:34:47.444 --> 02:34:49.747
ESTABLISH THE EXCHANGES. VERSUS

02:34:49.813 --> 02:34:51.281
A SAVINGS THAT WOULD HAVE THAT

02:34:51.348 --> 02:34:52.716
THAT HEALTH CARE COSTS

02:34:52.783 --> 02:34:55.786
HEALTHCARE SAVINGS COSTS THAT

02:34:55.853 --> 02:34:58.956
WOULD RESULT FROM. FROM THEM.

02:34:59.023 --> 02:35:01.225
RIGHT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

02:35:01.291 --> 02:35:03.060
ACADEMIC STUDY THAT LOOK AT THE

02:35:03.127 --> 02:35:06.330
I. WOOD CHARACTERIZED ALL OF

02:35:06.397 --> 02:35:10.234
THEM AS MEASURING- VOEPEL. AS

02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:11.602
LOOKING AT PRODUCTS MEASURES

02:35:11.669 --> 02:35:12.970
AND NOT HEALTH OUTCOMES IT'S

02:35:13.037 --> 02:35:14.371
VERY DIFFICULT TO GO ALL THE

02:35:14.438 --> 02:35:17.007
WAY TO- THE IMPACT YOU'RE

02:35:17.074 --> 02:35:18.475
HAVING ON HEALTH THROUGH THESE

02:35:18.542 --> 02:35:19.843
TOOLS THE TOOLS ARE ALWAYS

02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:22.446
JUST- SUPPORT THE OTHER

02:35:22.513 --> 02:35:25.249
CLINICAL INITIATIVES OR THINK

02:35:25.315 --> 02:35:27.718
THAT DOCTORS ARE DOING. SO I

02:35:27.785 --> 02:35:29.853
HATE TO SAY THAT THE BODIES MAY

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:32.256
NOT BE ENTIRELY SATISFYING AND

02:35:32.322 --> 02:35:34.625
HOW WELL THEY ACCOMPLISH WHAT

02:35:34.692 --> 02:35:37.461
YOU'RE DESCRIBING- BUT THEY

02:35:37.528 --> 02:35:40.464
HAVE BEEN TEMPTED. I GUESS AND

02:35:40.531 --> 02:35:42.166
THE REASON I ASK IS THAT YOU

02:35:42.232 --> 02:35:44.935
KNOW ONE OF THE BIG- CONCERNS

02:35:45.002 --> 02:35:46.437
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE IS THE

02:35:46.503 --> 02:35:49.440
GROWING COST OF HEALTHCARE. AND

02:35:49.506 --> 02:35:51.275
ELIMINATING SOME OF THE

02:35:51.341 --> 02:35:52.843
DUPLICATE DUPLICATION AND

02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:55.479
HEALTHCARE- IS ONE OF THE

02:35:55.546 --> 02:35:56.914
STATED GOALS OF THIS BUT I YOU

02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:59.850
KNOW I THINK WEEK WE KIND OF AT

02:35:59.917 --> 02:36:00.784
SOME POINT REALLY NEED TO

02:36:00.851 --> 02:36:03.087
UNDERSTAND ARE WE ARE WE ARE WE

02:36:03.153 --> 02:36:04.288
ADDING THE LATE ADDING

02:36:04.354 --> 02:36:06.356
SOMETHING TO THE SYSTEM. AND

02:36:06.423 --> 02:36:07.324
GETTING OUT WHAT WE'RE

02:36:07.391 --> 02:36:09.293
EXPECTING TO GET OUT AND IF WE

02:36:09.359 --> 02:36:10.360
ARE AT WHAT LEVEL THAT'S

02:36:10.427 --> 02:36:12.229
HAPPENING SO- THOSE ARE THE

02:36:12.296 --> 02:36:14.098
KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE- YOU

02:36:14.164 --> 02:36:15.966

UNDERSTAND SO. MAY NOT BE THE

02:36:20.037 --> 02:36:21.705
QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER BUT BUT

02:36:21.772 --> 02:36:22.840
TRUST ME AT SOME POINT WE'RE

02:36:22.906 --> 02:36:24.742

NO DOUBT THE INFORMATION IS

02:36:29.413 --> 02:36:31.849
EXTREMELY VALUABLE- BUT I'M

02:36:31.915 --> 02:36:32.783
LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE

02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:35.853

02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:31.835
SECOND ISSUE IS THAT FUNDING

COSTS OF WHICH CAN BE QUITE

02:43:40.677 --> 02:43:43.180
SUBSTANTIAL- OFTEN MANY OF

02:48:49.085 --> 02:48:50.386
AUTHORITIES ARE YOU CAN CREATE

02:48:50.453 --> 02:48:52.655
NEW LAW. MANDATES AS YOU'D

02:48:52.722 --> 02:48:54.891
HEARD- PREVIOUSLY THAT WILL

02:48:54.958 --> 02:48:57.627
REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE- THE

02:48:57.694 --> 02:48:59.162
EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AMONG

02:48:59.229 --> 02:49:01.965
STEP IN FRONT SPECIFIED

02:49:02.031 --> 02:49:03.766
PARTICIPANTS. SO WHAT ARE WHAT

02:49:03.833 --> 02:49:05.134
ARE THE CONS OF THE TWELFTH

02:49:05.201 --> 02:49:07.303
FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER. YOU CAN

02:49:07.370 --> 02:49:08.538
ORDER STEP WE DON'T GO THROUGH

02:49:08.605 --> 02:49:10.473
A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SO THERE

02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:11.708
ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEARINGS

02:49:11.774 --> 02:49:13.209
TYPICALLY- THEY DON'T GO

02:49:13.276 --> 02:49:14.410
THROUGH THAT SORT OF

02:49:14.477 --> 02:49:15.945
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND SO

02:49:16.012 --> 02:49:17.480
THEY'RE OFTEN THEY CAN CREATE

02:49:17.547 --> 02:49:19.883
OR BREED MISTRUST OR- OR ANGST

02:49:19.949 --> 02:49:22.952
OR OR OR WORSE- ABOUT THE NEW

02:49:23.019 --> 02:49:25.355
RULES AND- NEW REQUIREMENTS

02:49:25.421 --> 02:49:28.157
THERE PUT. PLACE I GUESS IN

02:49:28.224 --> 02:49:33.196
TERMS OF THE. IN TERMS OF THE

02:49:33.263 --> 02:49:36.399
LEGISLATION. ONE OF THE

02:49:36.466 --> 02:49:38.167
SHORTCOMINGS IN SOME CASES

02:49:38.234 --> 02:49:39.903
MAYBE THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE

02:49:39.969 --> 02:49:42.005
LAW AND THERE'S ONE EXAMPLE IN

02:49:42.071 --> 02:49:43.373
MINNESOTA WHERE THERE IS A

02:49:43.439 --> 02:49:44.941
STATEWIDE MANDATE FOR

02:49:45.008 --> 02:49:46.042
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD USE

02:49:46.109 --> 02:49:47.277
AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE IN

02:49:47.343 --> 02:49:49.846
WHILE MINNESOTA THE- THE

02:49:49.913 --> 02:49:52.482
MANDATE FOR EHRS RELIEF- HAD

02:49:52.549 --> 02:49:55.485
WENT INTO EFFECT AND WHAT WAS

02:49:55.552 --> 02:49:57.086
ALIGNED WITH HIGH TECH THERE IS

02:49:57.153 --> 02:49:58.621
REALLY VERY. MINIMAL

02:49:58.688 --> 02:50:00.423
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS FOR THAT

02:50:00.490 --> 02:50:01.791
THE INFORMATION EXCHANGE

02:50:01.858 --> 02:50:03.726
MANDATE AS A RESULT- THAT

02:50:03.793 --> 02:50:04.694
REALLY HASN'T COME TO PASS

02:50:04.761 --> 02:50:06.329
THERE HASN'T BEEN THE SAME SORT

02:50:06.396 --> 02:50:07.664
OF THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION

02:50:07.730 --> 02:50:09.432
EXCHANGE. THAT YOU SEE IN

02:50:09.499 --> 02:50:11.734
PLACES LIKE MARYLAND OR

02:50:11.801 --> 02:50:12.268
MICHIGAN OR NORTH CAROLINA

02:50:12.335 --> 02:50:14.003
WHERE. LEADERSHIP AND

02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:16.105
DIRECTIVES AND MANDATES- HAVE

02:50:16.172 --> 02:50:18.908
EXISTED AND HAVE HELP TO PUSH

02:50:18.975 --> 02:50:21.678
FORWARD INFORMATION EXCHANGE.

02:50:21.744 --> 02:50:25.548
SO THAT'S SORT OF WHERE THE

02:50:25.615 --> 02:50:27.116
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LEVERS

02:50:27.183 --> 02:50:29.552
EXISTS NOW WHAT DID WE LEARN

02:50:29.619 --> 02:50:30.753
AND WHICH DESCRIBE IN THE PAPER

02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:32.388
ABOUT HOW THESE ARE USED

02:50:32.455 --> 02:50:39.295
TOGETHER- FIRST OF ALL- I THINK

02:50:39.362 --> 02:50:41.030
ONE IS THAT WE FIND THAT. A

02:50:41.097 --> 02:50:43.666
MAJOR BARRIER IN AND STATES

02:50:43.733 --> 02:50:45.134
THAT CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH

02:50:45.201 --> 02:50:46.536
INFORMATION EXCHANGE IS THAT

02:50:46.603 --> 02:50:47.904
THERE'S A LACK OF SUPPORT OF

02:50:47.971 --> 02:50:49.906
STATE POLICIES AND LEADERSHIP

02:50:49.973 --> 02:50:51.374
YOU HEARD FROM AGAIN FROM THEIR

02:50:51.441 --> 02:50:54.077
HEART THAT. IN MARYLAND WHAT

02:50:54.143 --> 02:50:56.045
REALLY GOT. THE STATE MOVING

02:50:56.112 --> 02:50:57.480
WAS A GOVERNOR AND THE

02:50:57.547 --> 02:51:00.450
SECRETARY WHO WAS BEING- WHO

02:51:00.516 --> 02:51:02.418
TOOK THIS ON AS A MAJOR

02:51:02.485 --> 02:51:04.153
INITIATIVE FOR THE FOR THE

02:51:04.220 --> 02:51:06.255
STATE. AND FOLLOWED UP WITH

02:51:06.322 --> 02:51:08.391
LEGISLATION THAT ESSENTIALLY

02:51:08.458 --> 02:51:11.194
REQUIRED PARTICIPATION HIV OR

02:51:11.260 --> 02:51:14.030
H. I. O. SO WE FIND THAT NGUYEN

02:51:14.097 --> 02:51:15.398
IN STATES WHERE YOU HAVE THAT

02:51:15.465 --> 02:51:16.599
KIND OF STRONG LEADERSHIP AND

02:51:16.666 --> 02:51:18.301
SUPPORT OF POLICIES THAT ARE

02:51:18.368 --> 02:51:20.069
DIRECTED INCLUDING MANDATES.

02:51:20.136 --> 02:51:22.238
YOU TEND TO GET STATES THAT ARE

02:51:22.305 --> 02:51:25.274
MORE SUCCESSFUL. THE SECOND IS

02:51:25.341 --> 02:51:26.576
THAT THERE'S THIS IN MANY

02:51:26.643 --> 02:51:28.144
STATES THAT HAVEN'T REALLY

02:51:28.211 --> 02:51:30.146
ADVANCED THE BALL AS MUCH-

02:51:30.213 --> 02:51:31.648
THERE CAN BE A LACK OF A

02:51:31.714 --> 02:51:34.817
COMPELLING BUSINESS CASE AND A

02:51:34.884 --> 02:51:35.284
LACK OF INCENTIVES OR

02:51:35.351 --> 02:51:36.953
FINANCING. MARYLAND TOOK CARE

02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:38.454
OF THAT BY HAVING THIS GLOBAL

02:51:38.521 --> 02:51:39.589
PAYMENT PROGRAM WHICH REALLY

02:51:39.656 --> 02:51:41.057
ALIGNS WELL WITH THE

02:51:41.124 --> 02:51:42.925
REQUIREMENT TO EXCHANGE DATA.

02:51:42.992 --> 02:51:44.327
MICHIGAN SIMILAR REYES HAD A

02:51:44.394 --> 02:51:46.596
PAIR OF I'VE MENTIONED. THAT

02:51:46.663 --> 02:51:47.830
OUTLINED INFORMATION EXCHANGE

02:51:47.897 --> 02:51:49.732
REQUIREMENTS AND MANAGED CARE

02:51:49.799 --> 02:51:51.534
IN MEDICAID ALSO HAS

02:51:51.601 --> 02:51:52.602
REQUIREMENTS AROUND INFORMATION

02:51:52.669 --> 02:51:55.471
EXCHANGE. SO YOU YOU HAVE WERE

02:51:55.538 --> 02:51:57.540
STRONG REQUIREMENTS OF STRONG

02:51:57.607 --> 02:52:00.243
PAYER ALIGNMENT INCLUDING

02:52:00.309 --> 02:52:01.744
INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AND THE SAME

02:52:01.811 --> 02:52:03.346
THING WITH NORTH CAROLINA- YOU

02:52:03.413 --> 02:52:05.481
HAVE A MANDATE IN THE STATE.

02:52:05.548 --> 02:52:08.051
YOU HAVE A CARE IN BLUE CROSS

02:52:08.117 --> 02:52:08.584
THAT IS INCENTIVIZING AND

02:52:08.651 --> 02:52:11.020
REQUIRING INFORMATION EXCHANGE.

02:52:11.087 --> 02:52:12.555
YOU HAVE STATE FUNDING FOR THE

02:52:12.622 --> 02:52:15.224
INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND YOU

02:52:15.291 --> 02:52:16.392
HAVE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AND-

02:52:16.459 --> 02:52:17.593
FOR THE PAYMENTS TO SUPPORT

02:52:17.660 --> 02:52:18.494
ONBOARDING FOR NUMBER OF

02:52:18.561 --> 02:52:21.364
ORGANIZATIONS. YOU KNOW THE

02:52:21.431 --> 02:52:23.433
LACK IS AROUND PRIVACY CONCERNS

02:52:23.499 --> 02:52:25.068
FOR SOME TYPES OF DATA THOSE

02:52:25.134 --> 02:52:26.703
ARE SOME OF THE MEDIATED BY

02:52:26.769 --> 02:52:29.772
HIPAA AND- OTHER ACTS. BUT

02:52:29.839 --> 02:52:31.641
THERE STILL REMAINS SIGNIFICANT

02:52:31.708 --> 02:52:33.676
CHALLENGES AROUND- EXCHANGING

02:52:33.743 --> 02:52:35.678
INFORMATION FOR PEOPLE WITH

02:52:35.745 --> 02:52:37.346
WITH WITH. THERE IS A PROCESS

02:52:37.413 --> 02:52:39.148
MONITOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS

02:52:39.215 --> 02:52:41.384
AND HIV- AND THOSE ARE

02:52:41.451 --> 02:52:43.486
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES

02:52:43.553 --> 02:52:45.621
PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA. SO

02:52:45.688 --> 02:52:46.989
MOST OF WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT

02:52:47.056 --> 02:52:48.057
MOST STATES HAVE BEEN

02:52:48.124 --> 02:52:49.492
SUCCESSFUL HAVE REALLY CREATED

02:52:49.559 --> 02:52:50.793
A SERIES OF LEVERS ARE

02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:52.195
DEPRESSED MULTIPLE LEVERS OF

02:52:52.261 --> 02:52:54.864
WANTS TO BOTH. CREATE MANDATE

02:52:54.931 --> 02:52:56.566
HAVE A SUPPORT STRUCTURE THAT

02:52:56.632 --> 02:52:57.266
INCLUDES INCENTIVES AND

02:52:57.333 --> 02:53:00.403
PAYMENTS. AT THAT HAS- A WINE

02:53:00.470 --> 02:53:02.271
CONTRACTING BOTH IN MEDICAID

02:53:02.338 --> 02:53:04.240
AND ALSO IN THE PRIVATE CONTEXT

02:53:04.307 --> 02:53:05.742
AND THEY ALSO USED A SERIES OF

02:53:05.808 --> 02:53:06.776
THESE SORT OF SUPPORTIVE

02:53:06.843 --> 02:53:09.045
STRUCTURES LIKE INCENTIVES. AND

02:53:09.112 --> 02:53:10.480
THE SUPERVISORY GROUPS THAT

02:53:10.546 --> 02:53:13.616
HELP DEFINE AND SUPPORT POLICY

02:53:13.683 --> 02:53:16.486
DEVELOPMENT. SO WHEN I TELL YOU

02:53:16.552 --> 02:53:19.422
I TOLD YOU- WHAT KIND OF

02:53:19.489 --> 02:53:21.591
LEVERAGE WERE AVAILABLE. I'M

02:53:21.657 --> 02:53:23.459
WHAT WE SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY

02:53:23.526 --> 02:53:25.161
IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE STATES

02:53:25.228 --> 02:53:26.662
THAT HAVE USED A VERY SLIPPERS

02:53:26.729 --> 02:53:28.531
AND- HOW THOSE LEVERS CAN BE

02:53:28.598 --> 02:53:30.233
USED IN COMBINATION AND HAVE

02:53:30.299 --> 02:53:31.434
BEEN MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN USED

02:53:31.501 --> 02:53:34.203
TOGETHER. IN A FRIDAY STATES TO

02:53:34.270 --> 02:53:35.972
ADVANCE INFORMATION EXCHANGE-

02:53:36.038 --> 02:53:37.406
AND WITH THAT I THINK THAT-

INFORMATION EXCHANGES ARE-

02:54:20.016 --> 02:54:21.317
WORTHY OF OUR VERY SERIOUS

02:54:21.384 --> 02:54:22.885
CONSIDERATION I THINK WE SHOULD

02:54:22.952 --> 02:54:24.654

02:54:48.778 --> 02:54:50.079
INEFFICIENCIES REMOVE IT

02:54:50.146 --> 02:54:51.647
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE WHAT I

02:54:51.714 --> 02:54:52.648
CALL FRICTION IN THE SYSTEM

02:54:52.715 --> 02:54:53.716
THAT THAT NEED TO BE THERE THAT

02:54:53.783 --> 02:54:55.084
LEADS TO WORSE PATIENT OUTCOMES

02:54:55.151 --> 02:54:57.687
AND WORST PATIENT CARE YOU CAN

02:54:57.753 --> 02:54:59.021

WITH AS MUCH CLARITY AS

02:55:17.373 --> 02:55:19.141

QUESTION- BUT I THINK FIRST OF

02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:37.193
ALL. ARTICULATING A VISION FOR

02:55:37.260 --> 02:55:38.261
WHAT THE STATE REALLY WANTS TO

02:55:38.327 --> 02:55:39.929
ACCOMPLISH IN ITS PRIORITIES

02:55:39.996 --> 02:55:41.030
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FIRST AND IF

02:55:43.366 --> 02:55:44.667
THE STATE CAN DO THAT WITH THIS

02:55:49.839 --> 02:55:50.806
DEFINE WHAT THOSE PRIORITIES

02:55:50.873 --> 02:55:52.808
ARE THE BEST PRIORITIES COULD

02:55:52.875 --> 02:55:55.745
BE ANYTHING FROM CAROLINE AND

02:55:55.811 --> 02:55:57.079
ADVANCING PUBLIC OPTING OF THE

02:55:57.146 --> 02:55:59.615
THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT CALTRAIN

02:55:59.682 --> 02:56:02.118

EXCHANGE INFORMATION. FIRST

02:56:09.692 --> 02:56:11.460
DEFINING WHAT THOSE THOSE USE

02:56:11.527 --> 02:56:15.131
CASES AND THOSE ISSUES ARE.

02:56:15.197 --> 02:56:15.698
THAT'S THE THAT HAS TO BE A

02:56:15.765 --> 02:56:19.802
PRICE. FOLLOWING THAT. IT'S

02:56:19.869 --> 02:56:21.437
REALLY HARD TO SEE CALIFORNIA

02:56:21.504 --> 02:56:22.405
ADVANCING FURTHER WITHOUT

02:56:22.471 --> 02:56:24.173
HAVING SOME SORT OF DIRECTIVE

02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:26.609
FROM THE STATE AND THE FORM OF

02:56:26.676 --> 02:56:28.544
A MANDATE OF SOME KIND THAT

02:56:28.611 --> 02:56:30.813
SUPPORTS THAT VISION. OUT WE'VE

02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:33.249
TRIED FOR DECADES- AND I'VE

02:56:33.316 --> 02:56:35.551
BEEN AT THE STATE WHEN WE TRIED

02:56:35.618 --> 02:56:36.886
AND DID NOT SUCCEED IN

02:56:36.953 --> 02:56:38.187
ADVANCING INFORMATION EXCHANGE

02:56:38.254 --> 02:56:39.989
AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD WE DID IT

02:56:40.056 --> 02:56:42.658
WITHOUT A MANDATE- AND- QUITE

02:56:42.725 --> 02:56:44.460
FRANKLY WITHOUT HAVING SOME

02:56:44.527 --> 02:56:46.529
MORE DIRECTIVES BUT ALSO

02:56:46.595 --> 02:56:48.831
SUPPORTIVE POLICIES- BECAUSE

02:56:48.898 --> 02:56:50.199
UNFUNDED MANDATE AND AS YOU

02:56:50.266 --> 02:56:52.635
MENTIONED WE HAVE A DEFICIT-

02:56:52.702 --> 02:56:53.703
DOES NOT CREATE THE KIND OF

02:56:53.769 --> 02:56:55.104
<u>&lt;c.blue&gt;NVIRONMENT IT REALLY IS GOING&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:56:55.171 --> 02:56:56.339
TO SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS IN

02:57:01.777 --> 02:57:03.179
IMPORTANT THAT YOU CONSIDER THE

02:57:03.245 --> 02:57:06.482

DIRECTIVE BUT ALSO TO BE

02:57:10.286 --> 02:57:12.088
SUPPORTIVE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS

02:57:12.154 --> 02:57:12.989
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BEAR A

02:57:13.055 --> 02:57:14.857
GREAT DEAL ACOSTA AND FINDING

IT'S LEVERAGING. FEDERAL MONIES

02:57:18.427 --> 02:57:20.329
90% FEDERAL MATCHING.

02:57:20.396 --> 02:57:22.531
ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE A PRIORITY

02:57:22.598 --> 02:57:25.935

AT AND WE CAN. AND THIS IS A

02:57:51.227 --> 02:57:52.495
LEGISLATIVE BODY SO WE SEE A

02:57:52.561 --> 02:57:53.763
LOT OF THINGS TO THE LEFT OF

02:57:53.829 --> 02:57:55.131
LEGISLATION I KNOW THAT'S NOT

02:57:55.197 --> 02:57:57.933
THE ONLY. WAY TO MOVE-

02:57:58.000 --> 02:57:59.802
IMPORTANT POLICIES FORWARD BUT-

02:57:59.869 --> 02:58:00.903
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU MIGHT BE

02:58:00.970 --> 02:58:01.971
SAYING LEGISLATION IT COULD

02:58:02.038 --> 02:58:04.173
COULD BE A AN IMPORTANT WAY TO

02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:04.807
PROVIDE THE CLARITY DEPRIVE THE

02:58:04.874 --> 02:58:07.476
MANDATE- AND YOU HAVE A-

02:58:07.543 --> 02:58:09.512
COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE-

02:58:09.578 --> 02:58:10.713
MEANING YOU YOU SEE WHAT OTHER

STATUTE OR SOMETHING WE SHOULD

02:58:18.788 --> 02:58:20.089
BE LOOKING AT CLOSELY I. I

02:58:20.156 --> 02:58:21.657
THINK IT IS I THINK ONCE ONCE

02:58:21.724 --> 02:58:23.526
THERE'S A CLARITY OF THE VISION

02:58:23.592 --> 02:58:24.126
AND THE PROBLEMS TO SOLVE THE

02:58:24.193 --> 02:58:26.128
PRIORITIES. LOOKING AT THE

02:58:26.195 --> 02:58:27.563
VARIOUS MODELS OF STATES HAVE

EXAMPLES BUT THERE ARE OTHERS-

02:58:35.504 --> 02:58:37.773
WOULD BE. A VERY WORTHWHILE

02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:39.608
ENDEAVOR JUST TO ENSURE THAT

APPROVED NOT ANOTHER STATE SO I

02:58:46.882 --> 02:58:48.017
WOULD. CERTAINLY LOOK AT THEM

02:58:48.084 --> 02:58:50.419
AS- ESPECIALLY IF IT ALIGNS

02:58:50.486 --> 02:58:51.320
WITH SORT OF THE VISION OF THE

02:58:51.387 --> 02:58:54.090

IN HEALTH INFORMATION DATA

EXCHANGE RIGHT NOW. WELL ONE

02:59:21.917 --> 02:59:23.819

ARE SAFETY NET HOSPITALS ARE

02:59:39.835 --> 02:59:41.470
CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS THAT

02:59:41.537 --> 02:59:45.107
DO NOT HAVE EXTENSIVE- AND BACK

02:59:45.174 --> 02:59:47.343
SENSE OF RESOURCES TO BE ABLE

02:59:47.409 --> 02:59:49.211
TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING. TO BE

02:59:49.278 --> 02:59:50.079
ABLE TO CONNECT TO AN

02:59:50.146 --> 02:59:51.280
INFORMATION EXCHANGE TO BE ABLE

02:59:51.347 --> 02:59:52.148
TO SUSTAIN THAT CONNECTION

02:59:52.214 --> 02:59:53.616
THERE COMMUNITY CLINICS EIGHT

02:59:53.682 --> 02:59:55.151

ORGANIZATIONS- OVER TWO HUNDRED

02:59:57.720 --> 02:59:58.621
EIGHTY CORPORATIONS AND A

02:59:58.687 --> 03:00:00.022
NUMBER OF SMALL PRIMARY CARE

03:00:00.089 --> 03:00:02.091
PRACTICES THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO

03:00:02.158 --> 03:00:03.225
CONNECT AND SUSTAIN A

03:00:03.292 --> 03:00:04.827
CONNECTION BASED ON THE CURRENT

03:00:04.894 --> 03:00:06.195
REVENUES PARTICULAR MANY THE

03:00:06.262 --> 03:00:09.331
MARKET VERY HARD. I COVERED. SO

03:00:09.398 --> 03:00:09.965
THAT'S A SHIFT THAT'S IT

03:00:10.032 --> 03:00:11.834
INSTEAD MORE. CONCERN OR ISSUE

03:00:11.901 --> 03:00:13.536
BUT IT LONGER TERM YOU STILL

03:00:13.602 --> 03:00:14.870
HAVE SMALL PRACTICES THAT JUST

03:00:14.937 --> 03:00:17.473
COULD NOT BEAR THE BURDEN OF

03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:18.407
CONNECTING TO AN INFORMATION

03:00:18.474 --> 03:00:20.109
EXCHANGE. AND SUSTAINING THAT

03:00:20.176 --> 03:00:21.810
COST THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME WAY

03:00:21.877 --> 03:00:24.280
TO SUPPORT THAT- MANY OF THOSE

03:00:24.346 --> 03:00:25.981
CONSTITUENCIES. THAT'S ONE I

03:00:26.048 --> 03:00:27.383
THINK THE SECOND IS THERE'S A

03:00:27.449 --> 03:00:29.418
LACK OF THE KIND OF A REALLY

03:00:29.485 --> 03:00:31.120
COMPELLING BUSINESS CASE. WHEN

03:00:31.187 --> 03:00:32.721
HEALTH CARE IS STILL. LIKE IT

03:00:32.788 --> 03:00:34.456
OR NOT IT'S STILL A BUSINESS

03:00:34.523 --> 03:00:35.758
FOR THE MOST PART IT MAY BE

03:00:35.824 --> 03:00:37.026
PRINT NOW PREDOMINATED BY A

03:00:37.092 --> 03:00:38.160
NUMBER OF NONPROFIT

03:00:38.227 --> 03:00:40.429
ORGANIZATIONS BUT- IT IS A

03:00:40.496 --> 03:00:42.798
MARKET DRIVEN. ECONOMY AND

03:00:42.865 --> 03:00:44.400
UNLESS THERE IS A VERY CLEAR

03:00:44.466 --> 03:00:46.335
BUSINESS RATIONALE. AGAIN IT

03:00:46.402 --> 03:00:47.970
CAN BE SUPPORTED BY ENABLING

03:00:48.037 --> 03:00:49.471
LEGISLATION OR OTHER POLICIES

03:00:49.538 --> 03:00:50.739
BUT UNLESS THERE'S A CLEAR

03:00:50.806 --> 03:00:52.141
RATIONALE ORGANIZATIONS ARE

03:00:52.208 --> 03:00:55.444
GOING TO CHOOSE. WHAT TO INVEST

03:00:55.511 --> 03:00:57.780
IN BASED ON MANY THANKS THEIR

03:00:57.846 --> 03:00:59.148
MISSIONS MANY OF WHICH ARE

03:00:59.215 --> 03:01:00.482
KNOWN IF THERE'S NO MARGIN IS

03:01:00.549 --> 03:01:02.351
NO MISCHIEF THEY NEED TO MAKE

03:01:02.418 --> 03:01:03.819
SURE THEY CONTINUE TO EXIST-

03:01:03.886 --> 03:01:05.187
AND SO THEY HAVE TO MAKE

03:01:05.254 --> 03:01:07.089
INVESTMENTS BASED ON- THEIR

03:01:07.156 --> 03:01:08.157
BUSINESS INTERESTS. AND THERE

03:01:08.224 --> 03:01:10.492
IS NOT REALLY YET COMPELLING

03:01:10.559 --> 03:01:12.695
BUSINESS CASE IN CALIFORNIA-

03:01:12.761 --> 03:01:13.862
UNLIKE IN MARYLAND WHERE

03:01:13.929 --> 03:01:15.264
THERE'S ESSENTIALLY A

03:01:15.331 --> 03:01:16.665
REQUIREMENT BASED BECAUSE THEY

03:01:16.732 --> 03:01:18.534
PRODUCT LOCAL. THE PRODUCT

03:01:18.601 --> 03:01:20.102
GLOBAL BUDGET PROCESS AND THEY

03:01:20.169 --> 03:01:23.138
GET DATA FROM THE HOSPITAL

03:01:23.205 --> 03:01:23.739
THREE THIRTY JACQUI TO ENABLE

03:01:23.806 --> 03:01:26.875
AND SUPPORT THAT- SO WITHOUT A

03:01:26.942 --> 03:01:27.843
COMPELLING BUSINESS CASES

03:01:27.910 --> 03:01:29.445
WITHOUT FINANCING THOSE ARE TWO

03:01:29.511 --> 03:01:33.048
OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS I THINK

03:01:33.115 --> 03:01:35.918
THAT WE FACE. TODAY SO- FROM.

03:01:35.985 --> 03:01:37.453
NOW MAY I MISS BECAUSE THIS IS

03:01:37.519 --> 03:01:39.021
A VERY COMPLICATED SUBJECT

03:01:39.088 --> 03:01:41.457
OBVIOUSLY I MAY HAVE MISSED.

03:01:41.523 --> 03:01:43.425
MAY MISUNDERSTOOD THIS BUT- IS

03:01:43.492 --> 03:01:45.961
THE FUNDING FOR SOME OF THIS

DH CS THAT- THAT THERE WAS

03:01:53.602 --> 03:01:54.136
THERE'S SOME FUNNY RUNNING OUT

03:01:54.203 --> 03:01:57.539
IN SEPTEMBER. IS THAT. IS THIS

03:01:57.606 --> 03:01:59.675
TIED TO THE 90% FEDERAL MATCH

03:01:59.742 --> 03:02:02.444
IS THAT GOING TO BE AN ONGOING-

03:02:02.511 --> 03:02:06.215
MATCH THAT'S OUT THERE IN

03:02:06.282 --> 03:02:06.982
PERPETUITY OR OR OR NOT MORE WE

03:02:07.049 --> 03:02:09.985
CAN NEVER KNOW EVER. BUT BUT

03:02:10.052 --> 03:02:10.686
BUT YOU KNOW IS THAT IS THAT

03:02:10.753 --> 03:02:11.553

ENHANCE PATIENT CARE AND ALSO
