CALIFORNIANS.

00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:47.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
A BETTER ORGANIZED SYSTEM

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:48.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COVERING EVERY CALIFORNIAN WOULD

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALMOST CERTAINLY CUT OUR HEALTH

00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:51.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
CARE COSTS.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EVERY OTHER DEVELOPED NATIONS

SPENDS LESS ON THEIR HEALTHCARE

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:56.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAN WE DO. AND WITH BETTER

HEALTH CARE RESULTS.

00:22:57.943 --> 00:22:59.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

COVERAGE TO ALL. BY EXAMINING

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:04.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

MORE EFFICIENT.

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:12.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE KNOW THATPEOPLE WITHOUT

00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:14.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INSURANCE ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET

00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:15.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE MEDICAL CARE THEY NEED.

00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:17.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:19.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MEDICINE PUT IT SUCCINCTLY.

00:23:19.364 --> 00:23:21.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNINSURED PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY

00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:22.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO RECEIVE TOO LITTLE MEDICAL

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:25.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CARE AND RECEIVE IT TOO LATE.

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:27.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS A RESULT THEY ARE SECKER AND

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:30.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
DIE SOONER.

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:32.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I AM CONVINCED WE CAN IMPROVE

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

00:23:34.146 --> 00:23:36.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I BELIEVE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A

00:23:36.114 --> 00:23:37.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HUMAN RIGHT AND I BELIEVE

00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:40.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST DO

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:42.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BETTER. FOR ALL ITS RESIDENTS.

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:44.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

SPOKEN AND SHARE THEIR STORIES.

00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:31.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST

COUPLE OF MONTHS NOTHING IS MORE

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:34.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IMPORTANT THAN FINDING A PATH TO

COMPLETE COVERAGE FOR ALL

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:37.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS.

00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:41.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MUST

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:42.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROVIDE BETTER OUTCOMES THAN OUR

00:26:43.001 --> 00:26:45.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CURRENT SYSTEM IS PROVIDING.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHEN IT COMES TO WHEN WE COME TO

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AN AGREEMENT WHICH I BELIEVE WE

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:49.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WILL. IT WILL TAKE MONTHS AND

00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:50.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
YEARS TO IMPLEMENT AND I

00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:52.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
PERJURED TESTIMONY.

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:54.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

THIS COMMITTEE.

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:08.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

WE FIND BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG

00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:12.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
TERM SOLUTIONS.

00:27:12.397 --> 00:27:14.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I I KNOW THAT EVEN IF WE PASS

00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:15.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY AND IT WAS

00:30:12.744 --> 00:30:14.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR SUBJECT TO THE PRACTICES OF

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:16.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE INSURANCE COMPANY WE DO NOT

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:18.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CONTROL OUR OWN CARE. THEY

DEDUCTIBLES ANOTHER CARSHARING

00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:22.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE INCREASING CAN PEOPLE GO TO

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE DOCTOR THAT THEY NEED TO OR

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:26.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS THAT DR OUT OF NETWORK WILL

00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:27.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY HAVE HIGH FEES THESE OF THE

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:29.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROBLEMS S. B. FIVE SIX TWO

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:31.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ADDRESSES. AND THAT SIMPLY

00:30:31.429 --> 00:30:33.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROVIDING INSURANCE TO EVERYONE

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:36.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WILL NOT ADDRESS WILL NOT SOLVE.

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:38.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOOK AT THE DEDUCTIBILITY THREE

00:30:38.102 --> 00:30:39.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PERCENT OF AMERICANS SAY THEY

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:40.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HAVE TROUBLE PAYING THEIR

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:42.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEDUCTIBLE THAT'S NEARLY HALF.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND HERE IS WE GET TO THE CRUX

00:30:43.908 --> 00:30:45.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF IT WITH THE INSURERS DENIAL

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF CLAIMS IS THEIR BUSINESS

00:30:47.712 --> 00:30:49.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MODEL IN TWO THOUSAND. NINE

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:51.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ELEVEN WE DID A STUDY AND THEN

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:52.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BY THE TIME WE COMPLETED THAT

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:54.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STUDY THEY'VE NOW CLOSED OFF

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:57.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACCESS TO DATA ON CLAIMS DENIALS

00:30:57.822 --> 00:30:58.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:02.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOING CLAIMS BACK IN IN TWENTY

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:06.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ELEVEN WE SAW TWENTY FOUR

00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:07.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERCENT OF ALL CLAIMS WERE READ

00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:09.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
REJECTED.

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:10.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY'RE DOING THAT BECAUSE THEY

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:12.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
NEED THE PROFIT.

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:13.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NOW WE LOOK IT INDEPENDENT

00:31:13.905 --> 00:31:15.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MEDICAL REVIEW TO GET A SENSE OF

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
CLAIM DIALS NOW.

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LOOK AT THAT US ALMOST SIXTY

00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:20.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PERCENT CARE TONIGHT IS NOT

00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:21.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MEDICALLY NECESSARY BUT

00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:24.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ULTIMATELY. MOST OF THAT THAT

00:31:24.582 --> 00:31:26.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SIXTY PERCENT RATHER WAS IN FACT

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:28.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OVERTURNED BECAUSE THOSE CARE

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DENIALS WERE ILLEGITIMATE

00:31:30.154 --> 00:31:32.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PAYMENT DENIED AGAIN. MOSTLY

00:31:32.156 --> 00:31:34.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OVERTURNED ILLEGITIMATE TO NILES

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THESE INSURERS IN CALIFORNIA

DOLLARS IN PROFITS NET INCOME

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHY ARE CALIFORNIAN WORKERS AND

BUSINESSES PAIN FOR THE PROFITS.

00:31:44.602 --> 00:31:45.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

THIS DENIAL MODEL.

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:10.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

BOARD FOR FLEXIBILITY DETERMINE

00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:17.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO

THAT.

00:41:19.443 --> 00:41:21.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT WHEN DOING SO WE'RE ABLE TO

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:23.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE EVERYONE'S IN ONE SYSTEM

CORRECTED GOING FORWARD WE THINK

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:43.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT'S A MORE EFFICIENT WAY.

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED IN THE BILL.

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:56.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO

INTERESTS OF DISCIPLINE IN TIME

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:10.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I'M BASICALLY GONNA READ.

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS SUMMARY. THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PURPOSE OF HEALTHY CALIFORNIA IS

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SIMPLE.

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:17.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO CREATE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:19.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR THE STATE THAT ENABLES ALL

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:21.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TO ENJOY

00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:23.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DECENT HEALTHCARE AS A RIGHT.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIS IS CERTAINLY A LAUDABLE

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOAL BUT WE STILL NEED TO ASK

00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:28.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
SOME HARD QUESTIONS

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS IT REALISTIC TO BE ABLE TO

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:31.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROVIDE DECENT HEALTHCARE TO

00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:33.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA AND MORE

00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:34.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
SPECIFICALLY.

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:36.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IS THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA

00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:38.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROPOSAL A WORKABLE VEHICLE FOR

00:45:39.002 --> 00:45:40.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
ACHIEVING THIS GOAL.

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:44.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
MY SHORT ANSWERS ARE YES AND
YES.

00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:46.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROVIDING UNIVERSAL DECENT

00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:48.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTHCARE IS WITHIN REACH AND

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:50.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CALIFORNIA AND FOR THAT MATTER

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:52.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IN THE U. S. OVERALL.

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:54.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND YES HEALTHY CALIFORNIA DOES

00:45:54.551 --> 00:45:56.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROVIDE A VIABLE FRAMEWORK FOR

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACHIEVING THIS GOAL. LOTS OF

00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:00.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DETAILS WILL NEED TO BE FILLED

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:02.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN TO MAKE THE PROPOSAL FULLY

00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:04.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WORKABLE BUT IN MY VIEW THE

00:46:04.995 --> 00:46:06.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BASIC APPROACH IS SOUND.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN THESE REMARKS I'M GOING TO

00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:10.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TOUCH ON FOUR KEY ISSUES.

COSTS OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RELATIVE TO THE EXISTING SYSTEM.

00:46:15.772 --> 00:46:17.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TENCHI OFFER COST SAVINGS UNDER

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:20.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEALTHY CALIFORNIA. HOW TO FUND

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEALTHY CALIFORNIA AND WHAT THE

00:46:22.346 --> 00:46:24.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IMPACT WILL BE ON FUNDING

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:26.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HEALTHY CALIFORNIA ON THE

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:27.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
STATE'S HOUSEHOLDS AND

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:30.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUSINESSES RELATIVE TO WHAT

00:46:30.354 --> 00:46:31.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EVERYONE IS PAYING NOW FOR

00:46:31.855 --> 00:46:33.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
HEALTHCARE?

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:34.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NOW BEFORE GOING INTO THESE

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:35.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ISSUES I WANTED TO START BY

00:46:35.692 --> 00:46:37.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
RECOGNIZING.

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:39.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TWO RECENT REPORTS PROVIDED ON

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE ISSUE BY STAFF MEMBERS AT

WHOSE REPORT JUST CAME OUT TWO

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:52.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DAYS AGO.

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:53.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THESE ARE BOTH USEFUL REPORTS IN

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:55.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
MY VIEW.

00:46:55.579 --> 00:46:56.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I SPOKE WITH THE AUTHORS OF THE

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FIRST REPORT LED BY MISTER

RELEASED.

00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:02.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I AGREE WITH ABOUT SEVENTY

00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:03.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PERCENT OF WHAT'S IN BOTH

00:47:03.687 --> 00:47:05.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
REPORTS

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:06.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S NOT TOTALLY SURPRISING

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:08.959 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
THAT I WOULD AGREE IT SO
HAPPENS.

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:10.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT ONE OF MY BEST STUDENTS

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FROM UC RIVERSIDE MR ROBERT

PREPARING AT LEAST ONE OF THEM.

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
NOW THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

00:47:19.036 --> 00:47:20.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DIFFERENCE I HAVE WITH THESE

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:22.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REPORTS AS I WILL ADDRESS BELOW.

00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:25.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS I BELIEVE THERE ARE LARGE

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:27.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AREAS OF POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:29.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT ARE ATTAINABLE THROUGH

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:31.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTHY CALIFORNIA RELATIVE TO

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:32.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM.

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:35.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I REACHED THIS CONCLUSION NOT ON

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:37.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MY OWN BUT THROUGH ASSESSING THE

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RELEVANT RESEARCH LITERATURE ON

00:47:39.756 --> 00:47:42.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

CALIFORNIA THE SMALLER FIRMS

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:56.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WOULD PAY NOTHING IN GROSS

RECEIPTS FEE. AND MEDIUM SIZED

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:00.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:09.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE STATE COULD ALSO INSTITUTE A

SALES FEE OR TAX INCREASE OF TWO

00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:13.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
POINT THREE PERCENT.

00:54:13.783 --> 00:54:15.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THIS WOULD EXEMPT HOUSING

UTILITIES FOOD PURCHASE FOR HOME

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND A RANGE OF SERVICES.

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:22.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WE INCLUDE A TAX CREDIT FOR

LOW INCOME FAMILIES AT TWO

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PERCENT THAT WOULD RAISE THE

00:54:25.895 --> 00:54:29.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN BILLION.

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:31.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OTHER OPTIONS ARE OF COURSE

00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:33.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
POSSIBLE.

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:35.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WE'VE EXPLORED ONE OF THESE

00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:37.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN DETAIL IN OUR STUDY THAT IS

00:54:37.474 --> 00:54:39.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO SUBSTITUTE A PAYROLL FEE OR

00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:40.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TAX FOR THE GROSS RECEIPTS

00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:42.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
MEASURE.

00:54:42.345 --> 00:54:44.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE PAYROLL FEE TO GENERATE THE

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAME NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:48.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE TAX RATE WOULD HAVE TO BE

00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:49.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SIX POINT SIX PERCENT ON ALL

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
BUSINESSES

00:54:51.554 --> 00:54:52.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOW WHAT IF WE WANTED EXEMPTS

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:54.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SMALL BUSINESSES AGAIN.

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:56.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
CAN BE DONE.

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:58.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU EXEMPT THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED

00:54:58.094 --> 00:54:59.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PAYROLL FOR

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:01.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ALL BUSINESSES AGAIN ABOUT

00:55:01.898 --> 00:55:04.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EIGHTY PERCENT OF ALL BUSINESSES

00:55:04.067 --> 00:55:07.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IN CALIFORNIA WOULD PAY NO

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:10.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PAYROLL TAX OR FEE. TO MAKE UP

00:55:10.073 --> 00:55:11.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOR THE LOST REVENUE THE RATE

00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:13.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD HAVE TO RISE TO A MAXIMUM

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF SEVEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT FOR

00:55:14.944 --> 00:55:15.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE TWENTY PERCENT OF LARGER

00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:17.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
BUSINESSES.

00:55:17.313 --> 00:55:19.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT IF WE LOWERED THE EXEMPTION

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:20.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THRESHOLD TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:21.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AS OPPOSED TO TWO HUNDRED

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:22.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
THOUSAND?

00:55:22.852 --> 00:55:24.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE AVERAGE SMALL BUSINESS WOULD

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:26.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NOW PAY A FEE OR TAX AT TWO

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:28.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
PERCENT

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHILE LARGE BUSINESSES WOULD PAY

00:55:30.727 --> 00:55:32.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UP TO SEVEN POINT TWO PERCENT.

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:34.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR APPROACH IN PROPOSING THESE

00:55:34.864 --> 00:55:37.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
VARIOUS TAX MEASURES IS BASED ON

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:39.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE STANDARD GOAL WITH TAXATION

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:42.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POLICY. TO HAVE RATES SET LOW

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:43.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ENOUGH AS TO MINIMIZE

00:55:43.773 --> 00:55:45.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISTORTIONS AND HERE I WANT TO

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:47.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HIGHLIGHT AN AREA WHERE I AGREE

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:50.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FULLY. WITH THE A LEGISLATIVE

00:55:50.346 --> 00:55:52.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ANALYST'S OFFICE BECAUSE THEY

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:54.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HIGHLIGHT THIS EXACT POINT ON

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
PAGE SEVENTEEN.

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:57.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ECONOMISTS TEND TO PREFER TAXES

00:55:57.353 --> 00:55:59.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH BROAD BASES AND LOW RATES

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:01.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE THEY MINIMIZE ECONOMIC

00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:03.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DISTORTIONS THAT IS WHEN

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:05.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INDIVIDUALS AND FIRMS MAKE LESS

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:07.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EFFICIENT DECISIONS AND THEY

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD HAVE MADE WITHOUT THE TAX

00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:10.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SO. WE HAVE DELIBERATELY

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DESIGNED THIS SUCH THAT THE TAX

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:15.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RATES ARE CAPPED RELATIVELY LOW

00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:17.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE GENERATE THE NECESSARY

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REVENUE AT LOW RATES THAT'S

00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:20.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
CRITICAL.

00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:21.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOW WHAT ABOUT THE IMPACT ON

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:23.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES.

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RELATIVE TO THEIR CURRENT

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:26.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
HEALTHCARE COSTS MOST

00:56:26.382 --> 00:56:28.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALIFORNIAN FAMILIES WILL END UP

00:56:28.952 --> 00:56:30.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SPENDING LESS EVEN WITH THE NEW

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:32.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TAXES AND SOMEONE JOINT LARGE

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:34.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
GAINS.

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:36.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WORKING WITH THE GROSS RECEIPTS

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:38.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SALES TAX SCENARIO MOST

HEALTHCARE SPENDING FOR MIDDLE

00:56:39.662 --> 00:56:41.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INCOME FAMILIES WOULD FALL BY

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:43.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BETWEEN TWO POINT SIX AND NINE

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:44.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
PERCENT OF INCOME.

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MOST BUSINESSES WOULD ALSO SEE A

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:47.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
DROP IN SPENDING.

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:49.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SMALL FIRMS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:50.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROVIDING HEALTH INSURANCE FOR

00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:52.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEIR WORKERS WILL SEAT COSTS

00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:56.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FALL AS A WINDFALL BY TWENTY TWO

00:56:56.412 --> 00:56:58.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERCENT AS A SHARE OF PAYROLL.

00:56:58.114 --> 00:57:00.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR MEDIUM SIZE FIRMS COSTS WILL

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:02.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FALL BY AN AVERAGE OF BETWEEN

JUST THIS LAST MONTH?

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I HOW THE CANON INTERACTS WITH

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:19.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
CAP AND TRADE.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I IT WAS FEATURED IN SCOPE OF

BLOG.

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:25.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE CAP AND TRADE A IS NOT

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:29.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SUBJECT TO THE GAMUT.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:32.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
I AND.

01:08:32.107 --> 01:08:33.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE ONLY REASON IT'S NOT OR THE

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:34.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
SHORT ANSWER.

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:37.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT ALL THIS LEADS TO IS THAT

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:39.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CABIN TRADE IS AN AUCTION.

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:41.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT'S NOT MANDATORY THAT YOU

PARTICIPATE IN THE AUCTION.

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:46.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

IN CALCULATIONS FOR THE CAMERA

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'VE WOULDN'T CONSIDER INSURANCE

ASK PEOPLE TO TUNE INTO THAT.

AND THIS IS BASICALLY HIS

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
CONCLUSION

01:09:29.164 --> 01:09:30.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN SHORT RATHER THAN TRYING TO

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:31.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

OF A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM.

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:46.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

A LOCAL SALES TAX.

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:07.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

WHY HAS THE UNITED STATES LAGGED

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:55.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

PROTECT THE ACA.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME PEOPLE HAVE NEVER ACCEPTED

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:33.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE IDEA THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:35.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
USE ITS POWER TO IMPROVE

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:37.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

THIS OPPOSITION TO GOVERNMENT

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:39.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
REGULATED MEDICAL CARE IS

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PARTIALLY BASED ON THE VIEW THAT

PURSUIT OF SELF INTEREST.

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:50.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HUMAN EXISTENCE ITSELF IS VIEWED

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS A ZERO SUM GAME WHERE THERE

DESERVE HEALTH INSURANCE.

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:19.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SEVERAL STATES ARE ACTIVELY

SUCH A DEMAND ON ITS PEOPLE.

01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:26.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FROM MY DECADES OF EXPERIENCE AS

A DOCTOR.

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:29.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO MARKET

DRIVEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM CAN

DEMONSTRATES THAT THE BEST WAYS

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:41.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO REDUCE COSTS AND GUARANTEE

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:43.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HEALTHCARE TO EVERYONE IS TO

HAVE THE LARGEST RISK POOL THAT

IMPRESSIVE RESULTS INCLUDING AS

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:12.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

ELUDE US OFF. IT IS TO ACHIEVE

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIS GOAL NOW THAT I WISH TO

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:28.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
RETURN MY REMARKS.

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:30.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CAPITA PERSPECTIVE IS THAT AS

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:30.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LONG AS COVERAGE IS TIED TO

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:31.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:37.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED WE WILL

01:21:37.892 --> 01:21:38.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NEVER ACHIEVE HEALTH CARE REFORM

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:41.896 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
GROUNDED ON OUR FIVE CORE
VALUES.

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:43.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CAPITA FRO APPROACH IS ALSO

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:45.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FRAMED BY THE REALITY OF WHAT

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:47.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CALIFORNIA CAN AND CANNOT DO IN

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:48.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THE CURRENT PERIOD.

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:49.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND THAT CERTAINLY BEGS THE

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
QUESTION OF THE FEASIBILITY OF

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:53.608 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
SOME TYPE OF SINGLE PAYER
SYSTEM.

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:55.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ANY STATE LEVEL APPROACH TO SOME

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:56.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TYPE OF A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM

01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:57.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REQUIRES CAPTURE A FEDERAL

FUNDING FOR MEDICARE AND OTHER

01:21:58.913 --> 01:22:00.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PROGRAMS.

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:02.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIS CAPTURE RETURN REQUIRES NEW

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FEDERAL WAIVER LEGISLATION.

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:05.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YET IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:07.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALITY UNFORTUNATELY WE CANNOT

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:08.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EXPECT THESE WAIVERS FOR AT

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:09.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEAST THREE YEARS. AND THAT IS

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
HAVE WE ARE VERY LUCKY.

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:13.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WORKABLE MAJORITIES IN THE HOUSE

01:22:13.528 --> 01:22:14.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND SENATE WILL BE TO APPROVE

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND A PRESIDENT WILLING TO SIGN

01:22:16.164 --> 01:22:18.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SUCH WAIVERS MUST EXIST.

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:19.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO THAT GIVES CALIFORNIA AT

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:20.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MINIMUM A THREE YEAR PERIOD IN

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:22.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHICH TO PREPARE TO TRANSITION

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:23.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO SOME TYPE OF SINGLE PAYER

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:25.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SYSTEM.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
KAPPA BELIEVES THAT ONE WAY

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FORWARD MAYBE A STEP BY STEP

01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:30.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

STAKEHOLDERS

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:34.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THAT ALSO SURE THAT WE WILL

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:35.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT GET STUCK IN A TRANSITION

01:22:35.483 --> 01:22:36.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PHASE AND FAILED TO ACHIEVE OUR

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:39.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
GOAL.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:39.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CAPITA REALIZES THAT IT ALONE

01:22:40.055 --> 01:22:41.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CANNOT DEVELOP DETAILED POLICY

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:43.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROPOSAL THE CAN BE TRANSLATED

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:44.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO LEGISLATION THAT WILL BE

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:45.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE SUCH A TRIP

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
MAJOR TRANSITION.

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:50.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YET WE CAN DO IS BRING TOGETHER

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:51.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE EXPERTISE OF WILL DEVELOP

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:52.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THAT POLICY PROPOSAL.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SO CAP HAS LAUNCHED.

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:55.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WE CALL A ROADMAP TO SINGLE

BE ESSENTIAL IN THIS PROCESS AND

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:19.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CALIFORNIANS HAVE SHOWN THAT

ADDRESSING THIS CHALLENGE.

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:36.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT IS KEY TO UNDERSTAND THAT ANY

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:18.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MANNER WOULD MAKE TO PEOPLE WHO

THE BILL ITSELF AS LANGUAGE AND

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF NOT SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:35.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WILL PREVENT ITS PASSAGE.

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:36.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL'S

THE LINES I'VE LAID OUT.

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:47.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE ARE VERY WILLING TO WORK WITH

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:51.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY KAPPA

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:52.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT ALL

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD COME

01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:55.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:02.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOME OF CRITICIZED APPROACH IS

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:04.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INCREMENTALISM BUT WE AND CAPITA

01:29:04.405 --> 01:29:07.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CALL THAT STRATEGIC PLANNING.

KEY STAKEHOLDERS.

01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:16.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE STARTING POINT FOR THIS

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:17.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROCESS SHOULD BE AGREEMENT ON

COME UP WITH THE COST

01:40:12.206 --> 01:40:12.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
BUT THE THE.

01:40:13.006 --> 01:40:14.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF HOW TO PAY FOR THE COST OF

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:16.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE PLAN I THINK WAS A TO

PERCENT AROUND A TWO PERCENT

01:40:17.911 --> 01:40:19.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%

GROSS RECEIPTS TAX

RIGHT NOW THAN TWO PERCENT.

VERMONT WHO SAID THAT ONE OF THE

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MISTAKES THEY MADE WHEN THEY

01:40:42.503 --> 01:40:43.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TRIED TO PROPOSED SINGLE PAYER

01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:45.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IN VERMONT WAS NOT CLEARLY

01:40:45.973 --> 01:40:47.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

SORT OF GENERAL ASSUMPTION OF

01:40:56.617 --> 01:40:58.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT THE AVERAGE COMPANY THAT

01:40:58.185 --> 01:40:59.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROVIDES PRIVATE INSURANCE IS

01:40:59.853 --> 01:41:01.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
PAIN.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:05.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%

YEAH SO FIRST OF ALL AS I AS I

01:41:08.762 --> 01:41:10.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SAID IN MY OVERALL REMARKS.

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:13.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION.

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:14.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IN THE WAY WE DESIGN ARE

01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:18.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PROPOSAL. WAS PRECISELY.

01:41:18.172 --> 01:41:21.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO REMAIN WITHIN. THE FRAMEWORK

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:22.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AS ARTICULATED IN THE

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:24.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

01:41:24.878 --> 01:41:26.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
WHICH IS TO.

01:41:27.047 --> 01:41:29.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PREFERRED TAXES WITH BROAD BASES

01:41:29.249 --> 01:41:31.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
AND LOW RIGHT.

01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:32.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THE MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:33.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND PER MONTH WAS THAT THEY

01:41:33.954 --> 01:41:36.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
DIDN'T DO THAT.

01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:38.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY COULD HAVE DONE THAT THEY

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:40.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DIDN'T AYE AS IT HAPPENS I'VE

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:41.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:41:41.962 --> 01:41:43.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE AUTHOR. OF THE STUDY FOR

01:41:44.031 --> 01:41:46.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
VERMONT. WHO IN MY OPINION IS

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:47.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THE MOST EMINENT?

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:49.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ECONOMIST WORKING ON SINGLE

01:41:49.837 --> 01:41:51.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PAYER HEALTHCARE AND RELATED

01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:53.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ISSUES IN THE WORLD. A DOCTOR

01:41:53.507 --> 01:41:54.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WILLIAM SHALL OF HARVARD

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:55.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
UNIVERSITY

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:57.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HE HIMSELF TOLD ME THAT THEY

01:41:57.511 --> 01:41:59.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
MADE THAT MISTAKE.

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THEY DID NOT. ADHERE TO

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:04.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIS PRINCIPLE SO THAT THEY THE.

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:05.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROPOSAL WAS FOR A VERY HIGH

01:42:05.853 --> 01:42:08.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RATE THAT GOT PEOPLE WORRY. NOW

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:10.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE REALLY

01:42:11.058 --> 01:42:12.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
FOCUSED ON WAS.

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:13.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DESIGNING A SYSTEM THROUGH

01:42:14.027 --> 01:42:15.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHICH THE RATES OBVIOUSLY WE

01:42:16.063 --> 01:42:17.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE TO RAISE THE MONEY. THAT

01:42:17.598 --> 01:42:19.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE RATES ARE NOT SO HIGH AS

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:22.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THEY WOULD COST DISTORTIONS

01:42:22.069 --> 01:42:24.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SO.

01:42:24.538 --> 01:42:27.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEAH SO IN OUR STUDY WE HAVE.

01:42:27.407 --> 01:42:29.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF WE TAKE IT AS AN EXAMPLE.

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:31.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES AND

01:42:32.012 --> 01:42:33.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE'VE LOOKED AT TWO KINDS OF

01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:35.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES WITH TEN

01:42:35.415 --> 01:42:37.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO NINE. ATTENDED NINETEEN

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:39.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EMPLOYEES OVER TWENTY TO NINETY

01:42:39.753 --> 01:42:42.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
NINE EMPLOYEES SO.

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:43.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
RIGHT NOW.

01:42:43.657 --> 01:42:46.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:42:46.527 --> 01:42:48.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ATTENDED NINE EMPLOYEES

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:49.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE SPENDING HUNDRED AND EIGHT

01:42:50.063 --> 01:42:51.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:55.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ON HEALTH CARE PER YEAR AND

01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:57.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT THEY WOULD PAY BY THROUGH

01:42:57.271 --> 01:42:58.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX

01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:00.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
SCENARIO WOULD BE.

01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:02.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND.

01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:05.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO THE GROSS RECEIPTS TAX.

01:43:05.245 --> 01:43:07.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PROPOSAL.

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:09.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WOULD LOWER WOULD LOWER THEIR

01:43:09.616 --> 01:43:11.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEALTHCARE SPENDING BY THIRTEEN

01:43:11.952 --> 01:43:14.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POINT FOUR PERCENT AS I SAID

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:15.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THIS IS A MAJOR BENEFIT.

01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:17.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR MEDIUM SIZE FIRMS THAT'S NOT

01:43:17.357 --> 01:43:19.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
QUITE AS BIG FOR TWENTY TO

01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:21.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NINETY NINE EMPLOYEES. BUT IN

01:43:21.295 --> 01:43:24.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT CASE ARE RIGHT NOW WORST

01:43:24.131 --> 01:43:25.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SHOWING TOTAL HEALTHCARE

01:43:25.499 --> 01:43:27.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SPENDING IS THREE HUNDRED AND

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:29.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
FIFTEEN THOUSAND.

01:43:29.102 --> 01:43:30.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS THE

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:32.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GROSS RECEIPTS TAX THEY PAY A

01:43:32.072 --> 01:43:33.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:35.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DOLLARS SO THEY WOULD LOWER

01:43:35.609 --> 01:43:37.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEIR HEALTHCARE SPENDING AS A

01:43:37.077 --> 01:43:38.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SHARE OF PAYROLL BY SIX POINT

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:39.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
EIGHT PERCENT.

01:43:39.846 --> 01:43:40.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

01:43:40.681 --> 01:43:43.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONSISTENTLY YEAH EXCEPT ARE IN

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:45.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME CASES FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:46.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
VERY LARGE FIRMS HEALTHCARE

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:48.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
COSTS FOR BUSINESSES.

01:43:48.121 --> 01:43:50.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
GO DOWN.

01:43:50.223 --> 01:43:51.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND YOU KNOW THE GROSS RECEIPTS

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:54.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TAX IS ONE EXAMPLE I KNOW

01:43:54.361 --> 01:43:55.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE'S SOME CONCERN AND I READ

01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:57.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

01:43:57.364 --> 01:43:59.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

01:43:59.099 --> 01:44:01.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RECEIPTS TAX THAT'S FAIR.

01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:02.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE PUSH YOU GONNA BE CONCERNED

01:44:03.036 --> 01:44:04.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
ABOUT ANY.

FEE OR TAX AND ON THE OTHER

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:08.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAND VERY LARGE STATES OPERATE

01:44:08.875 --> 01:44:10.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WITH THESE THIS IS NOT A BIG

01:44:10.611 --> 01:44:13.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SECRET PROPOSAL. WE HAVE TEXAS

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE HAVE THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

01:44:14.881 --> 01:44:16.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE HAVE THE STATE OF DELAWARE WE

01:44:16.283 --> 01:44:17.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAD THE STATE OF OHIO THAT

01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:19.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
DEPEND HEAVILY.

01:44:19.252 --> 01:44:21.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ON UTILIZING THIS MEASURE SO WE

01:44:21.888 --> 01:44:23.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAN DO IT ON THE OTHER HAND IF

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:25.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU WANTED TO GO WITH THE. OF

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:26.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXTENDING THE EXISTING PAYROLL

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
TAX.

01:44:28.895 --> 01:44:30.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UP IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY DOABLE AS

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:31.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I SAID IT WOULD BE SIX POINT SIX

01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:33.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT TO RAISE THE SAME AMOUNT

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:35.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF REVENUE. AS YOU WOULD GET

01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:38.171 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
FROM OUR TWO POINT THREE
PERCENT.

01:44:38.238 --> 01:44:40.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
GROSS RECEIPTS FEET SO.

01:44:41.008 --> 01:44:42.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
IT YOU CAN DO IT.

01:44:42.676 --> 01:44:44.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND TO NOTE SIX POINT SIX

01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:45.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT IS HIGHER THAN TWO POINT

01:44:45.979 --> 01:44:48.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THREE PERCENT BUT IT IS STILL.

01:44:48.315 --> 01:44:50.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITHIN RANGE OF SOMETHING THAT

01:44:50.917 --> 01:44:54.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
WOULD NOT BE ONEROUS HAS WAS
THE.

01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:56.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE MEASURE AND AND VERMONT.

01:44:56.523 --> 01:44:58.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHICH WAS IT'S UNFORTUNATE IN

01:44:58.992 --> 01:45:01.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
VERMONT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:03.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESEARCH DONE THE PROPOSAL IN MY

01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OPINION. WAS OUTSTANDING.

01:45:05.999 --> 01:45:08.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE WORK DONE BY PROFESSOR SHALL

01:45:08.468 --> 01:45:09.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OUTSTANDING IN MANY WAYS I

01:45:10.003 --> 01:45:12.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MODELED OUR STUDY ON HIS.

01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:15.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HE THEY HAD THAT ONE ISSUE THAT

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:16.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU YOUR THE CHIEF HIGHLIGHTED

01:45:16.243 --> 01:45:17.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHICH I THINK THEY COULD HAVE

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:18.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
DONE A LOT BETTER.

01:45:18.612 --> 01:45:20.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
NOW YOU I'M YOU USE THE.

01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:22.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PHRASE SEVERAL TIMES HE SAID

01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:24.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
DECENT INSURANCE.

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:26.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO WHAT ASSUMPTIONS WERE YOU

01:45:26.219 --> 01:45:28.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
USING YOUR ANALYSIS ABOUT THE

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:30.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TYPE OF INSURANCE THAT PEOPLE

01:45:30.524 --> 01:45:31.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THIS WOULD PAY FOR BECAUSE

01:45:31.792 --> 01:45:33.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS A BIG RANGE OF INSURANCE

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S OFFERED BY. YOU KNOW FROM

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:36.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FROM PRIVATE INSURANCE FRANCE

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:40.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INTO SOME COMPANIES OR. GIVING.

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:41.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PLATINUM PLANS TO THEIR

01:45:41.735 --> 01:45:43.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EMPLOYEES YOU KNOW ALL THE WAY

01:45:43.537 --> 01:45:44.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO PEOPLE UNCOVER CALIFORNIA

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:46.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
BUYING

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:47.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU KNOW HIGHER DEDUCTIBLE. I

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:50.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TYPE POLICIES TO WHAT'S IN THEM

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:52.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FIVE SIX TWO WHICH YOU KNOW

01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:54.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SEEMS TO BE WRITTEN IS. IS MUCH

01:45:54.114 --> 01:45:56.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MORE LIKE ALONG THE PLATINUM IF

01:45:56.116 --> 01:45:56.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
NOT HIGHER.

01:45:56.783 --> 01:45:59.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TYPE OF ANALYSIS SO WHAT WE DID

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
YOU.

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:03.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DID YOU ENVISION ANY PARTICULAR

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:05.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COST FOUR TYPE OF INSURANCE OR.

01:46:05.926 --> 01:46:07.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
R. YOU SORT OF SPREADING THE

01:46:07.594 --> 01:46:09.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RANGE AND FINDING AN AVERAGE AND

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:10.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
USING THAT AS SORT OF YOUR COST

01:46:10.664 --> 01:46:12.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
ASSUMPTION.

01:46:12.999 --> 01:46:14.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO WHAT DOES THAT MATTER WHEN

01:46:14.768 --> 01:46:16.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU DO IT SO NOW IT'S LIKE SAID

01:46:16.536 --> 01:46:18.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT WELL ALL OF COURSE ALL

01:46:18.171 --> 01:46:19.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THESE THINGS MATTER AND OF

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:21.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
COURSE WHEN YOU DO.

01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:23.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STUDY OF SUCH BIG SYSTEM WE HAVE

01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:24.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO WORK WITH AVERAGES AND WE

01:46:24.678 --> 01:46:25.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK THAT RANGES WITHIN AVERAGE

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:27.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
JUST. SO YOU KNOW THE BASIC

01:46:27.748 --> 01:46:28.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
APPROACH WAS TO SAY LET'S LOOK

01:46:28.515 --> 01:46:31.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AT EXISTING COVERAGE.

01:46:31.752 --> 01:46:32.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

01:46:32.285 --> 01:46:35.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WITHIN THE EXISTING COVERAGE

01:46:35.122 --> 01:46:37.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
YOU KNOW WE FIND ABOUT.

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:39.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE.

01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:42.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
EITHER UNINSURED. ARE

01:46:42.729 --> 01:46:44.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNDERINSURED. AND AGAIN IF YOU

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:45.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WANT I CAN GO THROUGH OTHER

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:47.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DEFINITIONS OF UNDER IN CHECKING

01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:48.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE THINGS VERY VERY IMPORTANT

01:46:48.602 --> 01:46:49.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW SEVERE

01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:51.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THAT PROBLEM.

01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:53.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THEN WHAT WE SAID WAS LET'S

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:55.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BRING EVERYBODY WHO IS EITHER

01:46:55.408 --> 01:46:57.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
UNINSURED.

01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:59.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OR UNDER INSURED. UP TO.

01:47:00.013 --> 01:47:02.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FULLY INSURED SUCH THAT.

01:47:02.883 --> 01:47:05.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY DO NOT FACE THESE KINDS OF

01:47:05.619 --> 01:47:07.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROBLEMS THAT THEY CAN'T THEY

01:47:07.721 --> 01:47:09.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T. SEE A

01:47:09.256 --> 01:47:11.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PHYSICIAN OR THAT THEY FACE

01:47:11.391 --> 01:47:12.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
BANKRUPTCY.

01:47:12.392 --> 01:47:14.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SO BRING EVERYBODY UP.

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:16.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR THAT LEVEL AND THAT WHAT WE

01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:20.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SAID TO DO THAT WOULD ENTAIL.

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:21.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
COSTS YEAH GOING UP.

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:23.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:47:23.303 --> 01:47:24.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BY BY TEN PERCENT WITHIN THE

01:47:24.704 --> 01:47:26.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXISTING SYSTEM FLOW FROM THREE

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:28.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION.

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:29.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TWO FOUR HUNDRED BILLION WITHIN

01:47:29.576 --> 01:47:31.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE EXISTING SYSTEM BUT THEN

01:47:31.812 --> 01:47:33.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THE SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM.

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:36.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WOULD ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:38.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SUCH THAT WE THEN GET.

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:40.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVERYBODY AT DECENT COVERAGE AT

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:42.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION

01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:43.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
SO WOULD BE A NET.

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:45.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REDUCTION IN COSTS IN THE RANGE

01:47:45.926 --> 01:47:47.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF EIGHT OR NINE PERCENT WITH

01:47:47.694 --> 01:47:48.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVERYBODY GETTING RIGHT BUT ARE

01:47:48.862 --> 01:47:50.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU WERE YOU ANTICIPATING THE

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:51.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TYPE OF COVERAGE THAT THE BILL

01:47:51.731 --> 01:47:54.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
CALLS FOR. PODIATRY.

01:47:54.501 --> 01:47:57.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LONG TERM CARE YEAH YEAH ALL OF

01:47:57.370 --> 01:47:59.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT REAL ISSUE IS ALSO IN THERE

OKAY. NO AND THEN WILL YOU ALSO

01:48:01.575 --> 01:48:02.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

COST SAVINGS.

01:48:06.913 --> 01:48:10.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BEING MORE REGULATION I MEAN

01:49:14.614 --> 01:49:17.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUR STUDY WE ACTUALLY QUOTE FROM

01:49:17.284 --> 01:49:17.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

01:49:17.717 --> 01:49:20.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THE BILL ITSELF.

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SAID THE BILL ITSELF.

01:49:22.689 --> 01:49:24.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TALKS ABOUT SIMPLIFICATION

SO THEY AND I MY VIEW THE TO

01:49:39.306 --> 01:49:40.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE. LEFT OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE

01:49:40.807 --> 01:49:42.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DRAFT LEGISLATION BROADLY

01:49:42.475 --> 01:49:43.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MANDATES THE BOARD TO DEVELOP

01:49:43.443 --> 01:49:45.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SINGLE PAYER AS AN INTEGRATED

01:49:45.478 --> 01:49:48.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SYSTEM NOW. WHAT EXACTLY DO WE

01:49:48.114 --> 01:49:49.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
MEAN BY AN INTEGRATED?

01:49:49.716 --> 01:49:50.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND YOU KNOW THEIR VARIOUS WAYS

01:49:50.984 --> 01:49:52.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
TO DO THAT.

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:54.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME OF WHICH COULD INCLUDE FEE

01:49:54.754 --> 01:49:55.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
FOR SERVICE.

01:49:55.555 --> 01:49:58.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ON SOME CONTACTS WITHIN A

01:49:58.291 --> 01:49:59.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BROADER FRAMEWORK OF SOME KIND

01:49:59.626 --> 01:50:01.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
OF GLOBAL BUDGETING.

01:50:01.294 --> 01:50:02.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT'S I

01:50:02.862 --> 01:50:04.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THINK WHERE WE WILL INVOLVE.

01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:07.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'M AND WE HAVE PIECES OF THAT.

01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:07.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IN.

01:50:07.968 --> 01:50:09.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ALREADY IN OPERATION IN

01:50:09.703 --> 01:50:10.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

01:50:10.904 --> 01:50:11.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE STATE OF

01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:13.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MARYLAND THEY ARE HAVE GLOBAL

01:50:13.306 --> 01:50:14.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
BUDGETING.

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:16.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE THEY ARE INVOLVING IT IN

01:50:16.977 --> 01:50:19.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A POSITIVE WAY. BUT IT HAS TO BE

01:50:19.312 --> 01:50:19.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
DONE.

01:50:19.679 --> 01:50:21.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITHIN A CONTEXT WHICH IT'S NOT

01:50:21.948 --> 01:50:24.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ENTIRELY DONE NOW IN WHICH WE

01:50:24.150 --> 01:50:26.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
GUARANTEE DECENT CARE SO.

01:50:26.786 --> 01:50:29.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT IS A LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT

01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:31.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN MY VIEW IS NOT FULLY WORKED

01:50:31.658 --> 01:50:32.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
OUT. IN THE.

01:50:32.859 --> 01:50:35.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BILL THUS FAR AND SHOULDN'T BE

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:37.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF YOU

01:50:37.364 --> 01:50:39.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KNOW A LOT OF STUDY IN DETAIL

01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:42.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND UNDERSTANDING A LOT. OF THE.

01:50:42.268 --> 01:50:44.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MODELS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND

01:50:44.938 --> 01:50:46.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MAKING THEM WORK IN THE MOST

01:50:46.339 --> 01:50:48.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
EFFECTIVE WAY.

01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:49.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MEN HAVE YOU EVALUATED SINGLE

01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:51.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PAYER SYSTEMS VERSUS A VERY

01:50:51.177 --> 01:50:52.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HIGHLY REGULATED NONPROFIT MULTI

01:50:52.812 --> 01:50:54.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PAYER SYSTEM LIKE THEY HAVE IN

01:50:54.247 --> 01:50:54.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GERMANY AND SOME OF THE OTHER

01:50:54.848 --> 01:50:55.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COUNTRIES YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS

01:50:55.482 --> 01:50:56.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
ABOUT THAT.

01:50:56.983 --> 01:50:58.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WELL YOU KNOW I THINK THAT.

01:50:58.151 --> 01:51:00.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:51:00.653 --> 01:51:02.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:51:02.455 --> 01:51:03.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE'VE EVOLVED INTO A SYSTEM AND

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:05.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
WHICH.

01:51:05.325 --> 01:51:08.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON

01:51:08.161 --> 01:51:09.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE

01:51:09.729 --> 01:51:10.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
COMPANIES THAT THEY HAVE

01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:12.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
ENORMOUS MARKET POWER.

01:51:12.699 --> 01:51:15.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND THAT IS A MAJOR FACTOR

01:51:15.902 --> 01:51:17.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOLDING BACK THE. CREATION OF A

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:20.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SYSTEM.

01:51:20.173 --> 01:51:21.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
AND THAT THEREFORE.

01:51:21.207 --> 01:51:22.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT IS REALLY MOST CRITICAL IN

01:51:22.809 --> 01:51:24.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
MY VIEW?

01:51:24.377 --> 01:51:27.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS THE TRANSITION INTO A SIMPLE

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:28.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SYSTEM OUR A GOVERNMENT RUN

01:51:28.415 --> 01:51:30.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SYSTEM.

01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:33.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD WE HAVE

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:34.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
EXPERIENCES.

01:51:34.621 --> 01:51:37.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WITH FOR EXAMPLE MEDICARE.

01:51:37.257 --> 01:51:39.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHICH HAS A LOT OF FAVORABLE

01:51:39.426 --> 01:51:41.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OUTCOMES BUT IS ENORMOUSLY

01:51:41.628 --> 01:51:43.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COSTLY. I WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND

01:51:43.930 --> 01:51:45.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF COST CONTROLS WITHIN IT ARE A

01:51:45.832 --> 01:51:48.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOT OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:49.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE.

01:51:49.903 --> 01:51:52.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RIDERS INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

01:51:52.405 --> 01:51:55.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE STATE SO I THINK IN ORDER TO

01:51:55.108 --> 01:51:56.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ACHIEVE A SYSTEM THAT THAT

01:51:56.743 --> 01:51:58.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACCOMPLISHES THE COST SAVINGS

01:51:58.711 --> 01:51:59.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THAT WE NEED.

01:51:59.212 --> 01:52:00.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I DON'T THINK WE CAN RUN IT OUR

01:52:02.515 --> 01:52:04.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEM LIKE GERMANY'S I THINK WE

01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:06.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NEED TO MOVE TO A SIMPLE SYSTEM

01:52:07.053 --> 01:52:09.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH MINIMAL. UP DUROCHER SEE

01:52:09.322 --> 01:52:11.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AND MINIMUM AMBIGUITY

01:52:11.124 --> 01:52:12.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND LASTLY IS THERE ANY CREDIBLE

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:14.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ECONOMIST THAT YOU KNOW OF. WHO

01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:17.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINKS THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM?

01:52:17.864 --> 01:52:19.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
ARE UNREGULATED.

01:52:19.866 --> 01:52:22.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
CURRENT SYSTEM.

01:52:22.068 --> 01:52:25.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHERE? INSURANCE COMPANIES.

01:52:25.371 --> 01:52:27.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A WHERE WE HAVE SUCH A LACK OF

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
REGULATION.

01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:32.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AND. FOR CITIZENS TO.

01:52:32.612 --> 01:52:34.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%

INSURANCE POLICIES WITH VERY

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:38.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LITTLE CARE. ABOUT WHETHER OR

01:52:38.818 --> 01:52:41.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT THEY ACTUALLY CAN AFFORD.

01:52:41.221 --> 01:52:42.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET THIS OR

01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:43.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ANY ECONOMIST WHO THINKS THAT

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:46.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIS IS WORKING I THINK THAT'S A

01:52:46.459 --> 01:52:49.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

01:53:32.005 --> 01:53:33.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEY WANT TO THEIR PATIENTS

01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:35.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WITHOUT ALL THE RED TAPE.

01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:36.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO I'M VERY INTERESTED IN IT.

01:53:36.743 --> 01:53:38.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M GONNA PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF

01:53:38.711 --> 01:53:40.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE BECAUSE

01:53:40.446 --> 01:53:41.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW WHERE AT THE END OF THE

01:53:41.381 --> 01:53:42.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
ROLE.

01:53:42.448 --> 01:53:43.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AS FAR AS A LOT OF OUR

01:53:43.216 --> 01:53:44.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS.

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:46.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND I THINK SOME OF THESE

01:53:46.319 --> 01:53:46.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ASKED OF

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:49.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
NINE.

01:53:49.322 --> 01:53:49.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ASKING THEM BECAUSE I REALLY

01:53:49.889 --> 01:53:52.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
WANT TO KNOW.

01:53:52.392 --> 01:53:53.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT'S NOT YOU KNOW. ANYTHING

01:53:53.927 --> 01:53:54.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
OTHER THAN THAT.

01:53:54.761 --> 01:53:56.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:53:56.563 --> 01:53:57.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT UP

01:53:57.764 --> 01:53:59.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AGAINST AS LEGISLATORS OF ONE

01:54:00.033 --> 01:54:01.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE'VE TRIED TO ONE BILLS IN

01:54:01.067 --> 01:54:02.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
APPROPRIATIONS.

01:54:02.936 --> 01:54:04.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE TRY TO SET UP A PROGRAM OR

01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:06.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SYSTEM IN THIS ALWAYS THOSE

01:54:06.539 --> 01:54:07.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INITIAL ONE TIME COSTS THAT COME

01:54:08.041 --> 01:54:09.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
INTO PLAY.

01:54:09.542 --> 01:54:11.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY THEN YOU

01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:13.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DON'T GET INTO THE NITTY GRITTY

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:14.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
OF WHAT THE.

01:54:14.847 --> 01:54:15.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE OUTCOME WILL BE FOR THE

01:54:15.415 --> 01:54:17.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROGRAM.

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:20.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
WHAT WOULD BE THE ONE TIME
COSTS?

01:54:20.954 --> 01:54:22.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A LOT TO THE STATE'S GENERAL

01:54:22.188 --> 01:54:24.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FUND OR OTHER SOURCES OF GETTING

01:54:24.357 --> 01:54:25.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM OFF THE

01:54:25.525 --> 01:54:28.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
GROUND.

01:54:28.161 --> 01:54:30.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOME AND HOW WILL I BE PAID I

01:54:30.129 --> 01:54:30.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MEAN I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:54:30.897 --> 01:54:31.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE FOUR HUNDRED BILLION PRETTY

01:54:31.931 --> 01:54:34.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MUCH STATIC OPERATIONAL COSTS

01:54:34.934 --> 01:54:36.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS A.

01:54:36.269 --> 01:54:40.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
SET UP ON THIS.

01:54:40.873 --> 01:54:43.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR ME. ARVIN WHOEVER I MEAN FOR

01:54:43.843 --> 01:54:46.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THE ECONOMY.

01:54:46.579 --> 01:54:48.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE WELL THEY DEFINITELY ARE

01:54:48.147 --> 01:54:49.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
TRANSITIONAL COSTS.

01:54:49.415 --> 01:54:50.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY

01:54:50.783 --> 01:54:52.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THAT OUR STUDY.

01:54:52.685 --> 01:54:53.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AB VERSION CAME OUT AND MADE

01:54:53.686 --> 01:54:55.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
DOES NOT COVER THOSE.

01:54:55.788 --> 01:54:57.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THAT IS IT WOULD BE A FAIR

01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:59.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CRITICISM OF OUR STUDY BUT IT

01:54:59.959 --> 01:55:01.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REALLY WAS JUST A MATTER OF

01:55:01.594 --> 01:55:02.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOING WHAT I COULD AND THE TIME

01:55:02.729 --> 01:55:03.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
FOR.

01:55:03.963 --> 01:55:05.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUBSEQUENTLY WE HAVE LOOKED IN

01:55:05.865 --> 01:55:07.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IN SOME DETAIL.

01:55:07.533 --> 01:55:08.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE WITH RESPECTED TRANSITIONAL

01:55:08.935 --> 01:55:10.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
COSTS.

01:55:10.403 --> 01:55:12.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FOR PEOPLE NOW EMPLOYED.

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:14.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE

01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:15.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
INDUSTRY

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:17.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE WAYS WE'RE

01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:19.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GONNA CHIEF COST SAVING IN THE

01:55:19.078 --> 01:55:20.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SYSTEM THROUGH IT LOWERING

01:55:20.113 --> 01:55:22.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. MEANS

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:25.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LET'S FACE IT PEOPLE WILL NOT BE

01:55:25.118 --> 01:55:26.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NEEDED TO DO THEIR JOBS AND

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:29.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE SO WHAT

01:55:29.155 --> 01:55:29.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
WE'VE ESTIMATED.

01:55:30.023 --> 01:55:33.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
IS A FAIR TRANSITION

01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:36.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO MOVE PEOPLE WHO ARE EMPLOYED.

01:55:36.829 --> 01:55:38.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AB CURRENTLY IN PRIVATE HEALTH

01:55:38.564 --> 01:55:40.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INSURANCE IN OUR CALIFORNIAN

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:41.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:42.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THOUSAND PEOPLE HUNDRED FORTY

01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:44.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
SEVEN THOUSAND.

01:55:44.404 --> 01:55:47.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND AND WHAT IT ENTAILS.

01:55:47.807 --> 01:55:49.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE FIRST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO

01:55:49.742 --> 01:55:51.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE NEAR RETIREMENT MOVING THEM

01:55:51.744 --> 01:55:52.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
INTO.

01:55:52.612 --> 01:55:53.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
RETIREMENT.

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:56.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT.

01:55:56.182 --> 01:55:57.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THROUGH.

01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:59.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A GLIDE PATH TO MAINTAIN THEIR

01:55:59.652 --> 01:56:01.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WAGES AND PENSION FUNDS.

01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:02.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SECONDLY.

01:56:02.522 --> 01:56:05.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT. NEAR

01:56:05.158 --> 01:56:05.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
RETIREMENT.

01:56:06.059 --> 01:56:08.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SO THAT IS GOING TO BE.

01:56:08.895 --> 01:56:10.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWNTY FIVE

01:56:10.897 --> 01:56:13.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THOUSAND PEOPLE WE ESTIMATE THAT

01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:14.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND WILL

01:56:14.901 --> 01:56:16.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
STILL BE NEEDED.

01:56:16.836 --> 01:56:18.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO MOVE INTO THE PUBLIC SYSTEM

01:56:18.805 --> 01:56:20.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT THAT STILL LEAVES US WITH

01:56:20.306 --> 01:56:22.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND WHO
WON'T.

01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:23.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
SO WHAT WE.

01:56:23.076 --> 01:56:26.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE LOOKED INTO IS THE RATE AT

01:56:26.212 --> 01:56:26.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
WHICH.

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:30.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RETIREMENTS OCCUR IN OF PUBLIC

01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:31.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE OF

01:56:31.718 --> 01:56:33.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALIFORNIA NOT IN HEALTHCARE BUT

01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:36.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN COMPARABLE POSITIONS AND THEY

01:56:36.255 --> 01:56:37.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RATE AT WHICH NEW OPENINGS.

01:56:37.957 --> 01:56:39.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WOULD WOULD EMERGE THROUGH

01:56:39.726 --> 01:56:40.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHICH THESE PEOPLE COULD MOVE

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:42.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INTO AND WE ESTIMATE THAT WOULD

01:56:42.729 --> 01:56:44.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TAKE ABOUT THREE YEARS WORTH OF

01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:46.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NORMAL RATES OF RETIREMENT.

01:56:46.399 --> 01:56:48.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO GET PEOPLE INTO EMPLOYMENT

01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:50.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF THEY WANTED THAT EMPLOYMENT

01:56:50.536 --> 01:56:52.605 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
BUT WE'VE ALSO LOOKED AT WAYS
OF.

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:54.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
POSITIONS FOR.

01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:57.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR TWO YEARS

01:56:57.076 --> 01:56:58.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T TAKE THOSE

01:56:58.811 --> 01:57:00.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
JOBS WE'VE LOOKED AT JOB

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
TRAINING AND.

01:57:01.314 --> 01:57:03.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RELOCATION COSTS AND ROUGHLY

01:57:03.516 --> 01:57:05.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS I

01:57:05.785 --> 01:57:08.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK IT COST. AT AN INCREMENTAL

01:57:08.254 --> 01:57:09.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INCREASE ON TOP OF THE THREE

01:57:09.722 --> 01:57:10.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION AN

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:12.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCREMENTAL INCREASE OF AROUND

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:15.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONE PERCENT OF SYSTEM COSTS FOR

01:57:15.561 --> 01:57:16.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THREE YEARS.

01:57:16.763 --> 01:57:21.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO GET PEOPLE INTO AYE AYE A

01:57:21.401 --> 01:57:23.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOOD TRANSITIONAL SITUATION SO

01:57:23.503 --> 01:57:24.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE COSTS ARE REAL AND WE MAY WE

01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:28.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAN'T IGNORE THEM. UP BUT THEY

01:57:28.341 --> 01:57:29.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ARE MANAGEABLE.

01:57:29.642 --> 01:57:31.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE'S CERTAINLY MANAGEABLE

01:57:31.577 --> 01:57:33.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND AND AND WHEN WE FINISH THIS

01:57:33.413 --> 01:57:33.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LATEST VERSION OF WHAT WE'RE

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:35.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOING I WILL BE ABLE TO SHOW

01:57:35.448 --> 01:57:38.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:40.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DO YOU AND USED TO AND MENTIONED

01:57:40.887 --> 01:57:42.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT ALSO RESPONDED THAT. JUST

01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:44.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FROM A POSITION AND PUBLIC

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:45.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
HEALTH STANDPOINT.

01:57:45.925 --> 01:57:46.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THERE'S.

01:57:46.559 --> 01:57:49.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PART OF WHAT AND I DON'T HAVE

01:57:49.328 --> 01:57:50.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALL THE RESEARCH BEHIND THIS BUT

01:57:50.496 --> 01:57:51.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT'S AN IDEA THAT. MIGHT BE

01:57:51.431 --> 01:57:52.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
STUDY.

01:57:52.565 --> 01:57:54.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
PART OF THE CHAIN.

01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:56.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT BUT ALSO GENERATE COSTS IS

01:57:56.803 --> 01:57:59.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SHIFTING TO AN ENTIRE NEW.

01:57:59.739 --> 01:58:02.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SYSTEM OUR ENTIRE NEW ROCKETS

01:58:02.408 --> 01:58:03.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE NINE ENTIRE NEW AGENCY AND

01:58:03.843 --> 01:58:05.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT.

01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:06.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE WE LEARNED THIS SOMEWHAT FROM

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:08.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COVERED CALIFORNIA BECOMING A

01:58:08.448 --> 01:58:10.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEW ENTITY AND HAVING TO STAFF

01:58:10.249 --> 01:58:11.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
UP.

01:58:11.150 --> 01:58:13.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO THE QUESTION REALLY FOR US.

01:58:13.319 --> 01:58:15.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH CAN

01:58:15.655 --> 01:58:18.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE PARLAY WHAT ALREADY EXISTS

01:58:18.724 --> 01:58:22.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND MAY AT MASSIVELY IMPROVE IT

01:58:22.395 --> 01:58:23.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND AYE MP AYE EMPHASIZE

01:58:23.563 --> 01:58:24.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MASSIVELY BECAUSE IF WE THINK OF

01:58:24.897 --> 01:58:25.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE WE ALREADY

01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:27.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HAVE.

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:28.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:58:28.067 --> 01:58:29.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
CALIFORNIA.

01:58:29.502 --> 01:58:31.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IT'S CALLED MEDICARE.

01:58:31.304 --> 01:58:34.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND IT PROVIDES A LOT OF ALL

01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:36.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF WHAT'S

01:58:36.342 --> 01:58:37.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NEEDED IN HEALTHCARE AND AT

01:58:37.777 --> 01:58:38.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENT TIMES IS PROVIDED THAT

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:40.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMPREHENSIVE CARE AND ACTUALLY

01:58:40.913 --> 01:58:41.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
INCLUDED PODIATRY.

01:58:41.747 --> 01:58:43.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:45.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BUT IT NEEDS MAJOR MAJOR

01:58:45.451 --> 01:58:47.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
OVERHAUL.

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:49.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT THAN HAVING

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:52.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO RECONSTRUCT AN ENTIRE AGENCY

01:58:52.124 --> 01:58:53.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S ONE ISSUE AND THEN THE

01:58:53.226 --> 01:58:54.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OTHER THING IS IN THE COURSE OF

01:58:54.861 --> 01:58:56.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRANSITION OF COURSE DOLLARS ARE

01:58:56.963 --> 01:58:59.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REAL IMPORTANT. BUT DON'T FORGET

01:58:59.232 --> 01:59:01.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ABOUT BENEFITS THAT OCCUR

01:59:01.567 --> 01:59:03.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE IN THAT TRANSITION FOR

01:59:03.636 --> 01:59:04.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EXAMPLE I CAN TELL YOU FROM A

01:59:04.871 --> 01:59:07.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
POSITION OFFICE STANDPOINT.

01:59:07.173 --> 01:59:10.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INCREDIBLE YOU KNOW NARROWING

01:59:10.076 --> 01:59:12.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOWN AND SIMPLIFYING OF WHAT ARE

01:59:12.745 --> 01:59:15.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
VERY COMPLEX AND RIGOROUS AND

01:59:15.248 --> 01:59:18.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LABRYS AND YOU KNOW ACTIVITIES.

01:59:18.084 --> 01:59:20.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT ARE COSTLY AS FAR AS

01:59:20.453 --> 01:59:21.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVING STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DEAL

01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:23.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WITH. OF DIFFERENT FORMS IN

01:59:23.389 --> 01:59:24.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENT POLICIES AND DIFFERENT

01:59:24.590 --> 01:59:25.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
CONTRACTS AND ALL THESE

01:59:25.525 --> 01:59:26.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DIFFERENT PAIRS SO DON'T

01:59:26.859 --> 01:59:29.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OVERLOOK THAT ASPECT OF WHAT WE

01:59:29.195 --> 01:59:30.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT WE ACTUALLY IMPROVING THE

01:59:30.730 --> 01:59:32.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EFFICIENCIES. ARE AND CUT DOWN

01:59:32.565 --> 01:59:33.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
ON THE COSTS

01:59:33.966 --> 01:59:35.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT UNNECESSARY OVERHEAD FOR

01:59:35.234 --> 01:59:37.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MANY MANY PHYSICIANS OFFICES AND

01:59:37.703 --> 01:59:38.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
MEDICAL GROUPS IN MANY

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:39.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PHYSICIANS SPEND TWENTY HOURS A

01:59:39.805 --> 01:59:41.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WEEK ON THIS AND. IT'S EIGHTY

01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:44.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER U. S.

01:59:44.610 --> 01:59:46.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POSITION. COSTS IF YOU GOT A

01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:47.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GROUP PRACTICE OF FOR BURKE

01:59:47.747 --> 01:59:49.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TWENTY OR FIFTY YOU CAN THINK

01:59:49.749 --> 01:59:51.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT WHAT THE COSTS ARE JUST TO

01:59:51.317 --> 01:59:53.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BE ADMINISTRATION. AND ALL THOSE

01:59:53.252 --> 01:59:54.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE OUR SAVINGS THERE IN THERE

01:59:54.587 --> 01:59:56.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALSO I THINK SAVINGS WE CAN LOOK

01:59:56.155 --> 01:59:57.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT FOR STREAMLINING AND. THE

01:59:57.823 --> 01:59:59.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPROVING MEDI CAL AS YOU KNOW

01:59:59.525 --> 02:00:01.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOCTOR CHEN ALLUDED TO AND FOR

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

ELIGIBILITY CODES FOR MEDI CAL.

SERIOUSLY.

02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JUST A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UPS ON

02:00:09.268 --> 02:00:09.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THAT SO.

02:00:09.769 --> 02:00:10.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THE PRIVATE.

02:00:10.937 --> 02:00:12.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%

.

02:00:16.108 --> 02:00:17.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WHAT WORLD YOU SEE FOR THEM

02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:20.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
I MEAN WILL THEY BE?

02:00:20.179 --> 02:00:22.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PART OF THIS YOU KNOW TRYING

02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:24.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MAYBE DOING THE BILLING MAYBE

02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:26.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOING ARE THEY GONNA BE SOMEHOW

02:00:26.419 --> 02:00:27.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INVOLVED IN THE TRANSITION OR

02:00:27.553 --> 02:00:28.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
WILL THEY JUST BE.

02:00:28.487 --> 02:00:31.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
KIND OF ON THE WAY OUT.

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:32.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WELL THE LANGUAGE OF OF S. B.

02:00:32.792 --> 02:00:33.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
FIVE SIX TWO.

02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:35.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE LANGUAGE OF S. B. FIVE SIX

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:37.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TWO PROVIDES THAT THE PROGRAM IS

02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:39.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT A FULLY OPERATIONAL UNTIL

02:00:39.665 --> 02:00:41.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE FEDERAL MONIES HAVE BEEN.

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:43.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RECEIVED AND SO THERE IS THAT

02:00:44.003 --> 02:00:46.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERIODOF TIME POTENTIALLY WHERE.

02:00:46.539 --> 02:00:47.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
WE ARE.

02:00:47.073 --> 02:00:48.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRANSITION IN THE PROGRAMMING

02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:50.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'SWHAT DOCTOR POLAND'S NEXT

02:00:50.376 --> 02:00:51.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STUDIES GOING TO REVIEW THE

02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:53.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SPECIFIC SEVEN CLEARLY THE

02:00:53.312 --> 02:00:56.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAPPER PROJECT AS WELL. BUT I'M.

02:00:56.582 --> 02:00:57.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT WE

02:00:57.917 --> 02:00:59.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WERE THERE WILL BE PROVIDED

02:00:59.418 --> 02:01:00.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PRIVATE INSURANCE DURING THAT

02:01:00.419 --> 02:01:01.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TRANSITION PERIOD IT'S ALSO

02:01:01.654 --> 02:01:03.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POSSIBLE THE INSURERS WILL. YOU

02:01:03.356 --> 02:01:04.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KNOW DECIDE THAT THEY WANT TO

02:01:04.657 --> 02:01:06.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PACK UP AND GO HOME AND SO I TO

02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:07.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FIND ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:08.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
COVERAGE.

02:01:08.794 --> 02:01:10.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A I THINK THAT THAT THE REALITY

02:01:10.463 --> 02:01:12.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IS IS THAT THE.

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:13.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:14.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
COVERAGE

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:17.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT FOLKS CURRENTLY GET IS HERE

02:01:17.603 --> 02:01:19.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER SEVENTY

02:01:19.171 --> 02:01:20.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERCENT PUBLICLY FUNDED AND SO

02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:22.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE PUBLIC

02:01:22.408 --> 02:01:23.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESOURCES THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO

02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:24.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
REALLOCATE DURING THAT

02:01:25.044 --> 02:01:26.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRANSITION PERIOD AS WELL. AT

02:01:26.178 --> 02:01:27.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
LEAST ON THE STATE LEVEL

02:01:27.847 --> 02:01:29.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SO THAT'S WE ANTICIPATE.

02:01:29.749 --> 02:01:31.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:01:31.517 --> 02:01:32.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT LEVEL OF RESERVES WOULD BE

02:01:32.618 --> 02:01:34.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
NEEDED?

02:01:34.987 --> 02:01:37.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
QUESTION THE IMPACT OF LARGE

02:01:37.223 --> 02:01:38.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COST JOBS OR REVENUE DECLINES

02:01:38.157 --> 02:01:39.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
WHICH.

02:01:39.725 --> 02:01:42.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE SEE ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW IN

02:01:42.161 --> 02:01:47.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ANY BUDGET. YOU KNOW.

02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:48.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND WELL YEAH THAT'S ANOTHER

02:01:48.467 --> 02:01:49.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THING THAT'S A GREAT QUESTIONS

02:01:49.301 --> 02:01:51.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANOTHER ONE THAT IS NOT IN OUR

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:52.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STUDY VOTE WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE

02:01:53.039 --> 02:01:54.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WORKED THROUGH IT AND. I'LL BE

02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:57.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ABLE TO SEND YOU SOME DRIVERS

02:01:57.376 --> 02:01:58.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ALSO ON THAT.

02:01:58.544 --> 02:02:00.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

02:02:00.312 --> 02:02:02.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
IN IN THE BASICS.

02:02:02.615 --> 02:02:03.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HOW WE'VE LOOKED AT A FOR

02:02:03.649 --> 02:02:04.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXAMPLE THE PAYING THE PAYROLL

02:02:04.617 --> 02:02:05.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TAX OPTION WHICH I UNDERSTAND

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:07.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PEOPLE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:07.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT?

02:02:07.887 --> 02:02:09.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE GROSS RECEIPTS WOULD BE ON

02:02:09.155 --> 02:02:10.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
YOU KNOW.

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:13.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SIMILAR SO WHAT WE'VE LOOKED AT

02:02:13.426 --> 02:02:14.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
IS THE.

THE RANGE.

02:02:16.696 --> 02:02:18.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OF JUMPING UP AND DOWN.

02:02:18.964 --> 02:02:21.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND YOU KNOW FOR THOSE EITHER A

02:02:22.034 --> 02:02:22.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
MEMBER.

YEARS STATISTICS.

02:02:24.403 --> 02:02:25.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE STANDARD DEVIATION AROUND

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:27.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THE AVERAGE.

02:02:27.306 --> 02:02:29.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HAS ABOUT FOUR POINT FIVE

02:02:29.075 --> 02:02:31.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT MEANING SO THAT IF IF WE

02:02:31.577 --> 02:02:33.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE'VE GOT A GIVEN AMOUNT. OF

02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:34.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
REVENUE A YEAR.

02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:37.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOME YEARS IT'LL GO UP BY FOUR

POINT FIVE PERCENT SOME YEARS

02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:41.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THEN IN THE MAXIMUM CUT DOWN

02:02:41.353 --> 02:02:43.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BY FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT. SO

02:02:43.789 --> 02:02:45.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THE BASIC PRINCIPLE FOR

02:02:45.391 --> 02:02:47.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CREATING RESERVE FUND IS

02:02:47.193 --> 02:02:48.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
INSTRUCTORS QUITE

02:02:48.294 --> 02:02:49.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STRAIGHTFORWARD ONCE YOU. KNOW

02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:52.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT THE LONG TERM AVERAGES.

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:55.134 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
THEN WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO
OBSERVE.

02:02:55.201 --> 02:02:56.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
IS YOU KNOW.

02:02:57.002 --> 02:02:59.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE JUMPS UP AND THE JOHN STEM.

02:02:59.205 --> 02:03:01.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WHAT YOU HAVE TO THEIR FOUR

02:03:01.173 --> 02:03:03.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DO IS A INCORPORATE A PROVISION

02:03:03.609 --> 02:03:05.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THROUGH WHICH WHEN YOU HAVE A

02:03:05.444 --> 02:03:07.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
GOOD YEAR I JUMP UP.

02:03:07.847 --> 02:03:09.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU DON'T SPEND THAT MONEY YOU

02:03:09.515 --> 02:03:11.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PUT IT IN THE RESERVE FUND.

02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:12.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THAT IS THAT EXACTLY GOING

02:03:12.551 --> 02:03:14.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
TO BE MATCHED.

02:03:14.854 --> 02:03:17.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BY THE YEARS WHEN YOU GO DOWN

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:19.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BY FOUR POINT FIVE PERCENT YOU

02:03:19.692 --> 02:03:21.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WILL HAVE THE MONEY IN RESERVE

02:03:21.961 --> 02:03:23.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
FROM THE UP. SO.

02:03:23.729 --> 02:03:25.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT IT'S NOT HARD TO DESIGN A

02:03:25.998 --> 02:03:27.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESERVE FUND THAT WILL BE VIABLE

02:03:27.967 --> 02:03:29.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

AFTER THAT.

02:03:46.285 --> 02:03:47.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT'S REALLY NOT A VERY HARD

02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:48.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROBLEM.

02:03:48.387 --> 02:03:50.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GIVEN WHAT YOU KNOW ALL YOU

RANGE OF VARIATION AROUND THE

02:03:54.693 --> 02:03:56.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

AND IT SOMEWHAT RELATES TO THE

02:04:02.968 --> 02:04:03.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

AS A RESULT OF THAT IMPORTANCE

02:04:28.194 --> 02:04:30.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THE ACTUARIAL SPREAD BECAUSE

02:04:30.429 --> 02:04:32.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TO AVOID THE DOWN YEARS.

02:04:32.765 --> 02:04:34.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO AVOID THE DOWNED SWINGS AND

02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:37.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE REVENUE THAT COMES FROM THIS

02:04:37.102 --> 02:04:39.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ACTUARIAL

THAT TAX BASE.

02:04:46.345 --> 02:04:48.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND SO IF THAT'S SIPHONED OFF

02:04:48.547 --> 02:04:50.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE OF HAVING A LARGE ROLL

02:04:50.349 --> 02:04:51.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
OF.

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:53.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

ESTABLISH THE FOR

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:07.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:11.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IF PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING MORE

02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:12.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

BE ABLE TO GO PRIVATE INSURANCE

02:05:14.373 --> 02:05:15.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
AND DO THAT.

02:05:15.074 --> 02:05:16.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT YOU'LL SEE OVER THE NEXT

02:05:16.742 --> 02:05:18.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FEW YEARS BECAUSE INSURANCE

02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:20.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMPANIES ARE VERY KEEN ON THEIR

02:05:20.246 --> 02:05:22.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROFIT MARGIN? IS A LOT OF THE

02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:24.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMPANIES THAT HAVE MULTIPLE

THEY'RE GETTING THEY'RE. GETTING

02:05:30.923 --> 02:05:31.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SECOND GUESSES ABOUT STAYING IN

02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:32.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THE MARKET.

02:05:32.758 --> 02:05:34.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THE

02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:36.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MARGIN FOR THEM DESPITE THE FACT

02:05:36.228 --> 02:05:38.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT IT'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:05:38.097 --> 02:05:39.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

02:05:39.365 --> 02:05:41.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES JUST

02:05:41.066 --> 02:05:43.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STARTING TO NARROW DOWN AND AND

02:05:43.168 --> 02:05:44.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE OF THE

02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:45.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN WITH OUR

02:05:45.771 --> 02:05:48.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FRAGMENTATION. AND A LOT OF THE

02:05:48.207 --> 02:05:48.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

02:05:48.807 --> 02:05:50.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
NOW NURSES.

02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:52.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHICH IS WHY S. B. FIVE SIX TWO

02:05:52.511 --> 02:05:54.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
MOVES EXPEDITIOUSLY TO

02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:57.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRANSITION FROM THE INSURANCE

CALIFORNIA AND I AND I AND I

02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:03.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK THAT. CERTAINLY THIS AS A

02:06:03.355 --> 02:06:05.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MINIMUM BENEFIT PACKAGE IS NOT A

02:06:05.424 --> 02:06:07.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONCEPT IN S. B. FIVE SIX TO THE

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:08.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS.

02:06:08.827 --> 02:06:10.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARE THE PACKAGE BECAUSE THE

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:12.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BIGGER THE ROLE FOR. THE GOOD OF

THE ROLE FOR THE PRIVATE
ENSURES.

02:06:14.867 --> 02:06:16.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LESS EFFICIENT AND LESS SAVINGS

02:06:16.502 --> 02:06:18.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND MORE WASTE THERE IS IN THE

02:06:18.370 --> 02:06:20.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SYSTEM SO WE THAT'S WHY WE'VE.

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:23.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AFFORD A VERY COMPREHENSIVE.

SPENDING WILL BE REDUCED BY

02:07:02.314 --> 02:07:04.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
ABOUT FIVE PERCENT.

02:07:04.249 --> 02:07:05.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS A RESULT OF REDUCTIONS IN

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:08.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
UNNECESSARY SERVICES.

02:07:08.253 --> 02:07:11.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
REDUCED FRAUD OTHER
EFFICIENCIES.

02:07:11.357 --> 02:07:14.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHAT IS THE BASIS FOR THIS

02:07:14.326 --> 02:07:16.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ESTIMATE IS ARE THERE SOME

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:19.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONCRETE FIGURES OR STUDIES THAT

02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:19.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE BEEN DONE THAT COULD POINT

02:07:19.865 --> 02:07:21.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
TO?

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:23.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A YOU KNOW. AND THAT'S KIND OF A

02:07:23.569 --> 02:07:25.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BROAD THING UNNECESSARY SERVICES

02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:26.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH WHAT'S

02:07:26.739 --> 02:07:27.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BEEN SAID ABOUT A LOT OF THE

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:28.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THINGS WITH.

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:31.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:07:31.076 --> 02:07:33.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STEPPED THERAPIES OPINION ON

02:07:33.579 --> 02:07:35.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIALS ON ALL THOSE COSTS THAT GO

02:07:36.048 --> 02:07:38.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INTO ALL OF THAT. NAVIGATING A

02:07:38.283 --> 02:07:39.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
VERY.

02:07:39.385 --> 02:07:40.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
YOU KNOW BROADSYSTEM.

02:07:40.819 --> 02:07:41.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOW HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE

02:07:41.787 --> 02:07:42.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
FIVE PERCENT?

02:07:42.454 --> 02:07:44.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
?

02:07:44.923 --> 02:07:46.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DIDN'T THINK SANTA SOME CARE

02:07:46.492 --> 02:07:47.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BEING PROVIDED TODAY IS NOT HIGH

02:07:47.559 --> 02:07:49.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
VALUE CARE.

02:07:49.194 --> 02:07:50.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:07:50.896 --> 02:07:52.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WOULD CHANGE HONOR FULLY?

02:07:52.464 --> 02:07:54.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PUBLICLY FINANCED SYSTEM.

02:07:54.767 --> 02:07:56.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S A GREAT

02:07:56.402 --> 02:07:56.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
QUESTION.

02:07:56.668 --> 02:07:57.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:07:58.037 --> 02:08:00.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FIGURES HERE LIKE ALL OF THE

02:08:00.105 --> 02:08:01.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FIGURES ON COST SAVINGS COME

02:08:01.607 --> 02:08:03.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FROM THE RESEARCH LITERATURE.

02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:05.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OTHER FEE FOR IS THE STARTING

02:08:05.077 --> 02:08:06.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POINT FOR OUR ESTIMATE OF THE

02:08:06.845 --> 02:08:08.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
FIVE PERCENT.

02:08:08.414 --> 02:08:10.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS FROM A TWO THOUSAND AND TEN

02:08:10.215 --> 02:08:12.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDY BY THE U. S. INSTITUTE OF

02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:20.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE TWO THAT TWO THOUSAND AND

02:08:20.092 --> 02:08:21.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
TEN STUDY.

02:08:21.627 --> 02:08:24.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ESTIMATED THAT WASTE OF NOT

02:08:24.863 --> 02:08:27.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TOTAL WASTE BUT WASTE IN THESE

02:08:27.166 --> 02:08:29.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOUR CATEGORIES UNNECESSARY

02:08:29.501 --> 02:08:30.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SERVICES INSUFFICIENTLY

02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:32.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DELIVERED SERVICES MISS

02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:33.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PREVENTION OPPORTUNITIES AND

02:08:33.872 --> 02:08:35.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FRAUD. WAS NOT FIVE PERCENT WAS

02:08:36.041 --> 02:08:38.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
NINETEEN PERCENT.

02:08:38.177 --> 02:08:41.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OKAY NINETEEN PERCENT NOW ARE AS

02:08:41.213 --> 02:08:42.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE GO THROUGH IN OUR STUDY.

02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:44.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WAS A TWO THOUSAND AND TEN

02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:47.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STUDY AND AS WE GO THROUGH THERE

02:08:47.653 --> 02:08:47.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IS.

02:08:47.986 --> 02:08:51.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
MORE RECENT RESEARCH.

02:08:51.123 --> 02:08:52.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THAT AFFIRMS THAT.

02:08:53.025 --> 02:08:55.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BASIC FINDING AREACTUALLY A

02:08:55.994 --> 02:08:57.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SUGGEST THAT THE NUMBER IS.

02:08:57.729 --> 02:08:59.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
TOO LOW.

02:08:59.665 --> 02:09:01.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT SAY

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:04.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT OKAY THAT'S NOT REALISTIC.

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:05.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT YES THERE'S ALL THIS WASTE.

02:09:05.504 --> 02:09:07.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
BUT

02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:09.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET AT IT.

02:09:09.441 --> 02:09:10.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE IS NO WAY TO GET AT IT SO

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:12.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE'S NO POTENTIAL SAVINGS

02:09:12.111 --> 02:09:14.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'VE I'VE RECEIVE THAT CRITICISM

02:09:14.246 --> 02:09:15.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FROM OUR ON OUR REPORT FROM

02:09:15.547 --> 02:09:17.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
PEOPLE I RESPECT.

02:09:17.082 --> 02:09:19.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I DISAGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE.

02:09:19.952 --> 02:09:22.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IF YOU CANNOT GET AT IT IN

02:09:22.621 --> 02:09:24.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ANYWAY EVEN UNDER A TOTALLY

02:09:24.656 --> 02:09:26.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REORGANIZED ADMINISTRATIVE

02:09:26.458 --> 02:09:27.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STRUCTURE THEN ACTUALLY IT'S NOT

02:09:27.793 --> 02:09:29.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
WASTE.

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:30.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT'S PART OF HOW THE SYSTEM

02:09:30.195 --> 02:09:32.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
OPERATES.

02:09:32.297 --> 02:09:35.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO A. LOT WHAT WE'VE SUGGESTED

02:09:35.367 --> 02:09:37.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE FIVE PERCENT IS ACTUALLY A

02:09:37.336 --> 02:09:38.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
VERY LOW FIGURE.

02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:41.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RELATIVE TO THE SERIOUS RESEARCH

02:09:41.573 --> 02:09:43.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
LITERATURE INCLUDING.

02:09:43.175 --> 02:09:44.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THE WORK OF.

02:09:44.543 --> 02:09:46.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE PERSON WHO WAS THE.

02:09:46.411 --> 02:09:48.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE HEAD OF THE OF THE.

02:09:48.914 --> 02:09:50.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SEE A MASS UNDER PRESIDENT

02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:50.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
OBAMA.

02:09:50.749 --> 02:09:52.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:09:52.251 --> 02:09:54.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOR SOME TIME AT HOME WHO HAS

02:09:54.953 --> 02:09:56.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
READ OUR STUDY AND ACTUALLY SAID

02:09:56.722 --> 02:09:58.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
YOUR NUMBERS ACTUALLY.

02:09:58.257 --> 02:10:00.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
LOW.

02:10:00.859 --> 02:10:02.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SO WE THINK THAT'S IT AYE

02:10:02.361 --> 02:10:03.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF THE

02:10:03.428 --> 02:10:06.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POTENTIAL SAVINGS IN THIS AREA

02:10:06.965 --> 02:10:09.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND. PART OF WHAT GETS US THE

02:10:09.268 --> 02:10:12.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAVINGS IS A THROUGH INSTITUTING

02:10:12.471 --> 02:10:14.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
A SOME KIND OF A GLOBAL

02:10:14.106 --> 02:10:16.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BUDGETING SYSTEM. AND.

02:10:16.241 --> 02:10:19.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THEN ALSO INCLUDING WITH

02:10:19.745 --> 02:10:19.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
THAT THE.

02:10:20.012 --> 02:10:22.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:10:22.247 --> 02:10:23.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THE TYPES OF.

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:25.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
COMMITMENTS TOOK.

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:27.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
TO CARE AND TO.

02:10:27.653 --> 02:10:29.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

02:10:29.521 --> 02:10:30.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THE THE.

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:33.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BOARD THAT IS PROPOSED THAT IS

02:10:33.192 --> 02:10:34.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT INTO

02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:37.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THESE AREAS SO WE HAVE THE THE

02:10:37.596 --> 02:10:39.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COST CONTAINMENT WE HAVE THE.

02:10:39.431 --> 02:10:41.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SYSTEM OF REVIEW AND.

02:10:41.733 --> 02:10:44.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET.

02:10:44.136 --> 02:10:45.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF FIVE

02:10:45.971 --> 02:10:47.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PERCENT OUT OF THE ROUGHLY

02:10:47.306 --> 02:10:49.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TWENTY PERCENT. THAT THE

02:10:49.208 --> 02:10:52.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RESEARCH LITERATURE SAYS EXISTS

02:10:52.144 --> 02:10:54.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND IN THE AREAS OF WASTE AND BY

02:10:54.146 --> 02:10:56.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
THE WAY THIS FIVE PERCENT
FIGURE.

02:10:56.682 --> 02:10:58.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUT THE STUDY FOR VERMONT THAT

02:10:58.817 --> 02:11:00.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WAS REFERRED TO BEFORE.

02:11:00.786 --> 02:11:03.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY SAY IT'S TWENTY PERCENT.

02:11:03.288 --> 02:11:04.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A SO MY NUMBER IS ACTUALLY QUITE

02:11:04.423 --> 02:11:06.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
LOW RELATIVE TO WHAT'S OUT
THERE.

02:11:06.992 --> 02:11:08.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
AND IT WOULD BE

02:11:08.594 --> 02:11:11.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BETTER TO BE LOW BECAUSE IF YOU

02:11:11.163 --> 02:11:13.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXPERIENCE BETTER SAVINGS THAN

02:11:13.932 --> 02:11:15.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT SOLD BETTER HOW ARE YA

02:11:15.667 --> 02:11:16.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ENSURE. THAT BUT WHAT WE WE

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:18.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIDN'T WE DEFINITELY DIDN'T WANT

02:11:18.937 --> 02:11:21.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO GET A PRESENT YOU ALL OF YOU

02:11:21.873 --> 02:11:24.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
DECISION MAKERS. WITH

02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:26.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
UNREALISTIC FIGURES.

02:11:26.178 --> 02:11:27.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO I THOUGHT YOU KNOW OUR STUDY

02:11:27.646 --> 02:11:29.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
NATURALLY EVERY STUDY IS

02:11:29.414 --> 02:11:30.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
CRITICIZED.

02:11:30.115 --> 02:11:32.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND A LOT OF THE CRITICISMS

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:35.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE OF VALUE NO DOUBT SOME OF

02:11:35.921 --> 02:11:37.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THEM DON'T BOOK OKAY.

02:11:37.289 --> 02:11:39.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT THAT THE POINT IS THAT WHAT

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:40.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD WHEN WE GOT THAT THE MAIN

02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:42.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AREA OF FOCUS OF CRITICISMS WAS

02:11:42.961 --> 02:11:43.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AROUND THIS ISSUE OF COST

02:11:43.762 --> 02:11:45.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SAVINGS. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:11:45.597 --> 02:11:47.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NET. YOU KNOW THE DEBATE THAT'S

02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:49.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GONE ON A LOT OF THE CRITICISMS

02:11:49.668 --> 02:11:51.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KIND OF CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT

02:11:51.536 --> 02:11:53.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOME PEOPLE SAY WE ARE TOO LOW

02:11:53.171 --> 02:11:54.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
AND OUR ESTIMATE OF

02:11:54.273 --> 02:11:55.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS. SOME

02:11:55.807 --> 02:11:58.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PEOPLE SAY THAT WE ARE TOO HIGH

02:11:58.076 --> 02:12:00.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ON THIS FIVE PERCENT TO FIVE

02:12:00.178 --> 02:12:01.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERCENT A YEAR AGO RELATIVE TO

02:12:01.913 --> 02:12:03.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE TWENTY PERCENT THAT THE

02:12:03.749 --> 02:12:05.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RESEARCH LITERATURE SAYS IS

02:12:05.284 --> 02:12:06.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
WASTE.

02:12:06.251 --> 02:12:07.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OVERALL I THINK OUR OVERALL

02:12:07.185 --> 02:12:07.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ESTIMATE OF EIGHTEEN PERCENT

02:12:07.986 --> 02:12:09.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SAVINGS

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:11.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS A CONSERVATIVE NUMBER AT AN

02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:13.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ATTAINABLE AND ATTAINABLE NUMBER

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:15.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
REALISTIC.

02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:16.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ON ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

02:12:16.695 --> 02:12:18.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ALWAYS INCORPORATED INTO ON

02:12:18.263 --> 02:12:20.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEIR SERVERS SERVICES WAS ALL.

02:12:20.966 --> 02:12:23.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
AND IT ON TESTING.

02:12:23.435 --> 02:12:24.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU HAVE THIS TEST YOU NEED THAT

02:12:24.236 --> 02:12:25.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAS TO AND I THINK IT'S PART OF

02:12:25.137 --> 02:12:27.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IS. BASED ON THE CONCERN OF

02:12:27.773 --> 02:12:31.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MALPRACTICE AND LAWSUITS AND YOU

02:12:31.076 --> 02:12:33.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KNOW IT GOT TO A POINT WHERE.

02:12:33.578 --> 02:12:34.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW I HAVE MY BROTHER'S A

02:12:34.179 --> 02:12:37.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
POSITION.

02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:38.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
MALPRACTICE JUST.

02:12:38.984 --> 02:12:41.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COVERAGE YOU KNOW HOW TO AND

02:12:41.586 --> 02:12:43.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HE'S NOT IN CALIFORNIA'S AND NEW

02:12:43.388 --> 02:12:44.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YORK SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:12:44.523 --> 02:12:45.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE EVEN

02:12:45.624 --> 02:12:47.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
HAVE HERE.

02:12:47.592 --> 02:12:49.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IS A BIG DEAL I THINK THOSE

02:12:49.928 --> 02:12:51.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
LAWSUITS.

02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:53.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS THAT ADDRESSED IN SOME OF

02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:54.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THIS UNNECESSARY SERVICES

02:12:55.033 --> 02:12:56.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE I THINK THE RESULT OF

02:12:56.635 --> 02:12:59.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LAWSUITS IS EXTRA TESTING.

02:12:59.237 --> 02:13:01.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEAH I MEAN SO THERE WE TO DO WE

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:03.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISCUSS IN THE AND THE STUDIES

02:13:03.475 --> 02:13:04.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT IS CALLED IN THE LITERATURE

02:13:04.943 --> 02:13:06.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PHYSICIAN INDUCED DEMAND.

02:13:06.244 --> 02:13:09.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHERE PHYSICIANS EITHER? ARE

02:13:09.948 --> 02:13:12.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUGGESTING EXCESSIVE TESTING

02:13:12.384 --> 02:13:14.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE THEIR FEES THAT THEY CAN

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:16.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A GENERATOR OR BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:17.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
AFRAID OF LOS.

02:13:17.556 --> 02:13:19.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO ONE WHEN YOU MOVED TO A

02:13:19.825 --> 02:13:21.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WITH A

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SIMPLE ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE

02:13:23.595 --> 02:13:25.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AND CLEAR GUIDELINES.

02:13:25.831 --> 02:13:27.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WITH THE INTEGRATED CARE OF

02:13:28.066 --> 02:13:29.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
GLOBAL BUDGETING.

02:13:29.334 --> 02:13:31.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THOSE KIND THEY THE THE

02:13:31.136 --> 02:13:32.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POSSIBILITIES FOR THESE KINDS OF

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:34.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PROBLEMS.

02:13:34.239 --> 02:13:34.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE GONNA GO

02:13:35.006 --> 02:13:36.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AWAY ENTIRELY THEY'RE GOING TO

02:13:36.441 --> 02:13:37.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
BE DIMINISHED

02:13:37.809 --> 02:13:38.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND THAT'S HOW WE GET THE

02:13:38.343 --> 02:13:40.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SAVINGS.

02:13:40.512 --> 02:13:41.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I THINK THERE'S ALSO SOME

02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:43.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
OPPORTUNITIES FOR.

02:13:43.715 --> 02:13:45.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT IN IN TRANSITIONING TO

02:13:45.817 --> 02:13:46.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANOTHER SYSTEM LIKE THIS THERE

02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:48.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE. OPPORTUNITIES TO CHANGE A

02:13:48.754 --> 02:13:49.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REFORMER IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF

02:13:49.921 --> 02:13:52.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
DELIVERY SYSTEMS.

02:13:52.090 --> 02:13:53.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT YOU

02:13:53.625 --> 02:13:54.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
KNOW WE'RE ALREADY DOING THE

02:13:54.993 --> 02:13:55.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MOVING FROM VOLUME BASED.

02:13:55.994 --> 02:13:58.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PAYMENT TO A VALUE BASED.

02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
AND LOOKING AT.

02:14:00.065 --> 02:14:02.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EVIDENCE BASIS WHAT TYPES OF

02:14:02.067 --> 02:14:03.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MODELS OF CARE WORK BETTER IN A

02:14:03.735 --> 02:14:05.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FEE FOR SERVICE VERY INEFFICIENT

02:14:05.971 --> 02:14:08.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VERY VOLUME BASED. A NONPROFIT

02:14:08.473 --> 02:14:10.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEMS.

02:14:11.042 --> 02:14:11.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU KNOW EVIDENCE SPACES FOR

02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:15.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IS OF IS GOOD SO I THINK WE

02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:16.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES.

02:14:16.848 --> 02:14:17.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN DOING THIS BESIDES SAVING

02:14:17.883 --> 02:14:20.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
MONEY.

02:14:20.118 --> 02:14:21.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

SERVICE QUALITY.

02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:40.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT S. B. FIVE

02:14:41.039 --> 02:14:42.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SIX TWO DOES THAT IN A BETTER

02:14:42.874 --> 02:14:45.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAY. THEN THE KIND OF PRACTICES

02:14:45.076 --> 02:14:46.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THAT ARE USE NOW.

02:14:46.778 --> 02:14:49.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO THE VALUE OF PAIN FOR VALUE

02:14:49.414 --> 02:14:51.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OVER VOLUME HAS NOT SAVE MONEY

02:14:51.616 --> 02:14:52.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN THE U. S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

02:14:52.884 --> 02:14:54.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THAT IS A.

02:14:54.352 --> 02:14:56.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MANDATE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE

02:14:56.188 --> 02:14:58.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CARE ACT THAT HAS NOT YET PROVEN

02:14:58.156 --> 02:15:00.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ITS EFFICACY AND IN FACT RECENT.

02:15:00.859 --> 02:15:02.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THOSE

02:15:02.194 --> 02:15:04.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MODELS INHERENTLY DISCRIMINATED

02:15:04.095 --> 02:15:05.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

02:15:05.297 --> 02:15:07.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF COLOR. SO WE WOULD OBJECT TO

02:15:07.199 --> 02:15:09.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE APPLICATION OF THE DOCTOR

02:15:09.401 --> 02:15:11.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TURNS IN SKI SPEAKING OF. IN THE

COMPANIES ARE STILL IN CHARGE

02:15:13.839 --> 02:15:16.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE'S NO CONTROL OVER COSTS OR

02:15:16.274 --> 02:15:18.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRICES AND IN THAT ENVIRONMENT

02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:20.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THERE'S EVERY INCENTIVE. TO

02:15:20.412 --> 02:15:23.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REDUCE CARE IN ORDER TO FURTHER

02:15:23.081 --> 02:15:25.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE BOTTOM LINE THE BEST EXAMPLE

02:15:25.817 --> 02:15:27.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF THAT KIND OF SYSTEM NOW

02:15:27.853 --> 02:15:29.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COURSES KAISER PERMANENTE A.

02:15:29.287 --> 02:15:30.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEY MAKE A BILLION DOLLARS

EVERY QUARTER.

02:15:32.524 --> 02:15:35.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A BILLION DOLLARS EVERY QUARTER.

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:45.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE DON'T THINK THAT'S JUSTIFIED.

02:15:45.670 --> 02:15:47.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:15:48.006 --> 02:15:49.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

KIND OF COLLABORATION BUT WHAT

02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:52.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BETTER WAY THAN TO HAVE TO

02:18:53.058 --> 02:18:55.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMUNICATE WITH A MULTITUDE OF

DEALING WITH NON MEDICAL THINGS.

02:19:00.665 --> 02:19:02.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEN TO HAVE A SINGLE PAYER

THE POPULATION AND THAT CAN WORK

02:19:07.372 --> 02:19:09.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN A COLLABORATIVE MODE WITH

02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:12.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%

VETO THAT ACTUALLY HAD WOMEN

02:19:19.951 --> 02:19:21.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
MISDEMEANORS GETTING

THOSE THINGS TO EXISTING FUNDING

02:19:28.026 --> 02:19:29.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I GOT VETOED SO YOU CAN SEE

02:19:30.061 --> 02:19:31.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE WEIGHT WHERE HURT STATE IS

02:19:31.529 --> 02:19:31.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ON THAT.

02:19:31.796 --> 02:19:33.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

02:19:33.832 --> 02:19:34.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
QUICKLY.

02:19:34.499 --> 02:19:37.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I AM CONFUSED HOWEVER ABOUT THE

02:19:37.936 --> 02:19:39.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS IN

02:19:39.437 --> 02:19:41.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN

02:19:41.272 --> 02:19:44.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIAN OFFICES.

02:19:44.409 --> 02:19:46.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOW THAT WOULD TRANSLATE INTO

02:19:46.444 --> 02:19:47.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
LOWER HOLD SPENDING?

02:19:47.746 --> 02:19:49.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
?

02:19:49.681 --> 02:19:51.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE PROPOSAL WAS THAT PHYSICIANS

02:19:51.182 --> 02:19:51.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND HOSPITALS BE PAID AT

02:19:51.850 --> 02:19:54.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
MEDICARE RATES.

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:56.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AN ESTIMATE THE SAVINGS FROM

02:19:56.654 --> 02:19:58.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT PROPOSAL IF PHYSICIANS AND

02:19:58.923 --> 02:20:00.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOSPITALS ARE ABLE TO REDUCE

02:20:00.492 --> 02:20:02.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COSTS BY LAYING OFF BILLING

02:20:02.961 --> 02:20:04.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
RELATED STAFF.

02:20:04.963 --> 02:20:06.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOW WILL NOT RESULT IN REDUCED

02:20:06.731 --> 02:20:08.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
COSTS FOR CONSUMERS?

02:20:08.399 --> 02:20:09.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF THE PROVIDERS ARE STILL BEING

02:20:09.901 --> 02:20:12.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
PAYING MEDICARE RATES

02:20:12.504 --> 02:20:14.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THAT OUTLAY IS STILL THERE

02:20:14.239 --> 02:20:16.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT. HOW DOES THAT TRANSLATE THE

02:20:16.508 --> 02:20:17.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONLY WAY I CAN SEE THAT WORKING

02:20:17.809 --> 02:20:18.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
IS IF?

02:20:18.743 --> 02:20:20.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ULTIMATELY THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE

02:20:20.979 --> 02:20:23.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PAYMENT RATES EVEN LOWER THE

02:20:23.882 --> 02:20:26.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SOMETHING.

02:20:26.484 --> 02:20:28.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
OKAY SO IN OUR.

02:20:28.219 --> 02:20:28.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
PROPOSAL AND.

02:20:28.853 --> 02:20:30.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:20:30.655 --> 02:20:32.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEAH I THIS I DIDN'T PUT UP THE

02:20:32.290 --> 02:20:34.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SLIDES BECAUSE I WANTED TO LOOK

02:20:34.392 --> 02:20:34.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
AT ME.

02:20:34.626 --> 02:20:36.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

02:20:36.194 --> 02:20:39.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IF WE GO TO TABLE STAFF AND

02:20:39.831 --> 02:20:40.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHICH I GUESS IS WHAT YOU'RE

02:20:40.398 --> 02:20:41.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
REFERRING TO.

02:20:41.366 --> 02:20:41.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
WE HAVE.

02:20:43.101 --> 02:20:45.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THREE SOURCES.

02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:47.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS.

02:20:47.872 --> 02:20:49.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND SO THOSE WOULD BE.

02:20:49.407 --> 02:20:52.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADMINISTRATION WITHIN HOSPITALS

02:20:52.177 --> 02:20:54.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ADMINISTRATION AND DOCTORS

02:20:54.212 --> 02:20:56.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
OFFICES AND CLINICS.

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:57.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEN THE PRIVATE INSURANCE

02:20:57.682 --> 02:20:58.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND AS YOU CAN SEE WE BREAK

02:20:58.917 --> 02:21:00.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THOSE OUT.

02:21:00.518 --> 02:21:02.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ARM ONE BY ONE SO THAT'S

02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:04.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ADMINISTRATIVE.

02:21:04.322 --> 02:21:05.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NOW THAT'S DISTINCT IN OUR

02:21:05.957 --> 02:21:09.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CATEGORIZATION FROM THE SAVINGS

02:21:09.327 --> 02:21:11.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
THAT WOULD ACCRUE THROUGH
MOVING.

02:21:11.529 --> 02:21:14.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO UNIFORM MEDICARE RATES.

02:21:14.599 --> 02:21:17.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAID THE UNIFORM MEDICARE RATES.

02:21:17.669 --> 02:21:19.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:21:19.671 --> 02:21:20.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
YEAH SO WE HAVE THE

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:22.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS AND

02:21:22.273 --> 02:21:23.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HOSPITALS ONE POINT THREE

02:21:24.042 --> 02:21:24.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PERCENT.

02:21:24.275 --> 02:21:26.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:21:26.144 --> 02:21:27.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I. AND THEN WE GET THAT BY

02:21:27.946 --> 02:21:29.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO SAVE FORTY

02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:31.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERCENT ON ADMINISTRATION WHICH

02:21:31.583 --> 02:21:32.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACTUALLY IN AS AGAIN IT'S A LOW

02:21:33.017 --> 02:21:34.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NUMBER RELATIVE TO. WHAT WE'VE

02:21:34.919 --> 02:21:36.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
HEARD AND SO FORTH?

02:21:36.221 --> 02:21:36.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
NOW.

02:21:36.654 --> 02:21:38.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MOVING TO THE MEDICARE RATES.

02:21:38.156 --> 02:21:39.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:21:39.924 --> 02:21:40.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

02:21:40.091 --> 02:21:41.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:44.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
S. AS WAS REFERRED TO A MOVING

02:21:44.195 --> 02:21:45.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO UNIFORM MEDICARE RATES WOULD

02:21:45.563 --> 02:21:46.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MEET ME IN A RATE INCREASE

02:21:46.931 --> 02:21:49.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RELATIVE TO MEDI MEDI CAL.

02:21:49.734 --> 02:21:51.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND WOULD MEAN A REDUCTION

02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:53.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
RELATIVE A TO PRIVATE.

02:21:53.438 --> 02:21:56.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO THERE THERE IS CERTAINLY AN

02:21:56.207 --> 02:21:56.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ISSUE.

02:21:56.741 --> 02:21:58.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE DOCTOR TO ACTIONS KEY

02:21:58.109 --> 02:21:59.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
RAISED ON THAT.

02:21:59.510 --> 02:22:00.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE TO

02:22:00.845 --> 02:22:02.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN. AS AS

02:22:03.014 --> 02:22:04.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DOCTORS DZERZHINSKY ALSO

02:22:04.482 --> 02:22:05.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
MENTIONED.

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:07.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHEN THAT THE PHYSICIANS

02:22:07.218 --> 02:22:09.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
OFFICES ARE GOING TO BE
RELEASED.

02:22:09.921 --> 02:22:11.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM HAVING TO COVER THE THESE

02:22:11.856 --> 02:22:13.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND THE

02:22:13.091 --> 02:22:15.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TIME SPENT THAT WILL ENABLE THEM

02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:16.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
TO ALSO.

02:22:16.561 --> 02:22:17.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
BRING IN.

02:22:17.729 --> 02:22:20.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MORE PATIENTS AND SO THOUGH THE

02:22:20.298 --> 02:22:22.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RATES ARE RELATIVE TO PRIVATE

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:23.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RATES ARE GOING TO COME DOWN.

02:22:24.035 --> 02:22:25.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE AMOUNT OF TIME DEVOTED TO

02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:27.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BILLABLE HOURS WILL ACTUALLY

02:22:27.538 --> 02:22:29.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
INCREASE AND.

02:22:29.107 --> 02:22:30.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE WILL HAVE MORE PATIENTS

02:22:30.808 --> 02:22:31.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMING IN BECAUSE EVERYONE IS

02:22:32.043 --> 02:22:33.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO HAVE DECENT CARE SO WE

02:22:33.478 --> 02:22:35.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THINK THAT. ON BALANCE.

02:22:35.713 --> 02:22:37.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
PHYSICIANS HAVE.

02:22:38.049 --> 02:22:40.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INCOME WILL NOT BE HURT BY THIS

02:22:40.418 --> 02:22:41.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
MEASURE.

02:22:41.819 --> 02:22:43.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND DATA I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE

02:22:43.988 --> 02:22:45.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
TO SHOW THAT.

02:22:45.690 --> 02:22:47.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ONCE YOU OPEN UP ACCESS LIKE

02:22:47.091 --> 02:22:48.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THIS YOU KNOW A LOT OF

02:22:48.793 --> 02:22:49.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PHYSICIANS WE WILLING TO SEE

02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:50.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PATIENTS.

02:22:50.461 --> 02:22:51.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOW THAT THEY'RE NOT SEEING NOW

02:22:51.696 --> 02:22:53.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
YOU WORLD.

02:22:53.498 --> 02:22:55.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GET CONTROL OF YOUR. ASTHMA

02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:56.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
HEART DISEASE.

02:22:56.901 --> 02:22:58.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
HYPERTENSION.

02:22:58.770 --> 02:22:59.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BOB DIABETES OTHER CHRONIC

02:23:00.004 --> 02:23:01.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
ILLNESSES.

02:23:01.539 --> 02:23:03.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A HUGE COST

02:23:03.508 --> 02:23:05.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE THESE PATIENTS ARE BEING

02:23:05.243 --> 02:23:06.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SEEN WITH CHRONIC DISEASE AND

02:23:06.611 --> 02:23:08.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REGULAR. PRIMARY CARE WHETHER

02:23:09.013 --> 02:23:10.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THESE QUANTITIES CAN BE MANAGED

02:23:10.381 --> 02:23:12.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
A SHOP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS

02:23:12.116 --> 02:23:12.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER

02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:14.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOSPITALIZATION RIGHT FOR THESE

02:23:14.485 --> 02:23:15.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PATIENTS BECAUSE ARE NOT UNDER

02:23:15.086 --> 02:23:17.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REGULAR. PRIMARY CARE WHERE THE

02:23:17.922 --> 02:23:19.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GETTING CONTINUITY OF CARE.

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:21.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OPENING UP LIKE THIS TO DOCK.

02:23:21.793 --> 02:23:22.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUMPING UP THAT TYPE OF ACCESS

02:23:22.927 --> 02:23:25.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO PHYSICIANS WOULD BE EXCEPT

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:26.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACCEPTING MORE PATIENTS LIKE

02:23:26.364 --> 02:23:28.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THIS WILL OVER TIME REDUCE

02:23:28.166 --> 02:23:29.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS REDUCE

02:23:30.001 --> 02:23:31.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOSPITALIZATIONS AND ADMISSIONS

02:23:31.803 --> 02:23:33.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO THEY WILL CUT COSTS THAT WAY.

02:23:33.237 --> 02:23:34.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMMEDIATELY BUT OF AN UP FRONT

02:23:34.539 --> 02:23:35.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INVESTMENT BUT OVER TIME TO WILL

02:23:35.907 --> 02:23:37.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BE SAVINGS BECAUSE THE QUALITY

02:23:37.875 --> 02:23:39.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF CARE WILL IMPROVE. AND YOU'RE

02:23:39.911 --> 02:23:41.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NOT GOING TO HAVE. A LOT OF

02:23:41.612 --> 02:23:42.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND

02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:43.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOSPITALIZATION RATES THEY ALL

02:23:43.748 --> 02:23:46.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
WILL GO DOWN.

02:23:46.384 --> 02:23:51.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
HOW MANY?

02:23:51.889 --> 02:23:53.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I WAS GOING TO ADD THAT WE CAN

02:23:53.257 --> 02:23:54.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ASSUME THAT DOCTORS ARE GOING TO

02:23:54.726 --> 02:23:56.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WORK THE SAME NUMBER OF HOURS

02:23:56.327 --> 02:23:57.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY'RE WORKING NOW UNDER. THE

02:23:57.829 --> 02:23:59.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NEW SYSTEM BUT THEY WILL NOT BE

02:23:59.497 --> 02:24:00.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SPENDING THE HOURS ON

02:24:00.431 --> 02:24:01.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ADMINISTRATION SO THEY'RE

02:24:01.532 --> 02:24:03.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACTUALLY BE MORE CLINICAL HOURS

02:24:03.201 --> 02:24:05.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AVAILABLE TO THEM IS. AS STEVE

02:24:05.303 --> 02:24:06.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SAYS AND SO WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:24:06.571 --> 02:24:08.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POSITION SHORTAGE WELL THE BEST

02:24:08.106 --> 02:24:10.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WAY TO CREATE MORE TIME FOR

02:24:10.408 --> 02:24:12.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PHYSICIANS TO DO CLINICAL

02:24:12.076 --> 02:24:13.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TREATMENT. IS TO ELIMINATE THEIR

02:24:13.778 --> 02:24:17.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ADMINISTRATIVE TIME AND SING AND

02:24:17.415 --> 02:24:20.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
CRY SIX TWO DOZEN.

02:24:20.952 --> 02:24:22.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M IS AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:24.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PEOPLE ACTUALLY BE LAID OFF OR.

02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:27.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM.

02:24:28.059 --> 02:24:29.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEAH SO SO AS I MENTIONED IN IN

02:24:29.694 --> 02:24:31.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THE HEALTH.

02:24:31.095 --> 02:24:32.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OUR INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

02:24:33.031 --> 02:24:35.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:24:35.166 --> 02:24:36.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RIGHT NOW THE STATE EMPLOYEES

02:24:36.801 --> 02:24:37.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN

02:24:37.902 --> 02:24:39.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THOUSAND PEOPLE.

02:24:39.637 --> 02:24:40.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND IF WE IF YOU TAKE THESE

02:24:40.972 --> 02:24:42.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE THIS

02:24:42.607 --> 02:24:44.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ESTIMATE OF ADMINISTRATIVE

02:24:44.308 --> 02:24:46.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAVINGS. THAT WOULD MEAN ROUGHLY

02:24:46.177 --> 02:24:47.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
HALF OF THEM.

02:24:47.678 --> 02:24:49.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT GET A LAID OFF FROM THEIR

02:24:49.947 --> 02:24:51.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
EXISTING POSITION.

02:24:51.582 --> 02:24:53.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE OTHER HALF COULD BE MOVED

02:24:53.317 --> 02:24:54.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
INTO THIS

02:24:54.852 --> 02:24:57.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADMINISTERING THE STATE PROGRAM

02:24:57.288 --> 02:24:58.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT YOU KNOW. TWICE THE LEVEL OF

02:24:58.656 --> 02:25:00.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
EFFICIENCY

02:25:00.458 --> 02:25:01.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AND SO WHAT WE THEN.

DETAILS ON THAT AND WE LOOKED AT

02:25:29.487 --> 02:25:31.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOW OUTSIDE OF THE HEALTH CARE.

02:25:31.556 --> 02:25:33.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

MOVE. AND SO WHAT WE FOUND WAS.

02:25:41.499 --> 02:25:43.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:25:43.701 --> 02:25:45.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAT OF THOSE POSITIONS.

.

02:25:46.804 --> 02:25:48.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF PEOPLE

WHO ARE IN THAT AGE RANGE OF

SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE

02:25:57.949 --> 02:25:59.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND SO THAT OVER A THREE YEAR

02:25:59.984 --> 02:26:01.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERIOD WE THINK WE COULD MOVE.

02:26:01.719 --> 02:26:04.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF PEOPLE WANT THOSE JOBS L.

02:26:04.122 --> 02:26:05.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
INTO THOSE

OUR OTHER JOBS

02:26:07.692 --> 02:26:09.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND IN ADDITION WE ALSO.

02:26:09.427 --> 02:26:11.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
PROVIDE FOR THEM.

02:26:11.762 --> 02:26:14.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

GUARANTEES

02:26:18.035 --> 02:26:19.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THROUGH THAT AS I SAID THERE

02:26:19.704 --> 02:26:21.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WERE THERE ARE COSTS AND THE

02:26:21.372 --> 02:26:22.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COST WOULD BE I THINK IN THE

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:24.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RANGE OF ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF

02:26:24.375 --> 02:26:26.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEM COSTS FOR THREE YEARS. TO

02:26:26.677 --> 02:26:28.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%

SITUATION.

02:26:32.049 --> 02:26:32.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

HEALTH INSURANCE.

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:43.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
YEAH.

IN A.

02:26:46.264 --> 02:26:46.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK TO DRILL DOWN ON THAT

02:26:46.864 --> 02:26:47.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
QUESTION

02:26:47.498 --> 02:26:49.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
TO THE DELIVERY SINCE

02:26:49.267 --> 02:26:49.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

WHAT ABOUT.

02:26:50.134 --> 02:26:52.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
DOWN ON

02:26:52.203 --> 02:26:53.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CARE RATES BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL

02:26:53.771 --> 02:26:54.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE AS MANY

02:26:54.839 --> 02:26:56.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BILLER'S STORY YOU KNOW DEALING

WITH ALL THE.

02:26:56.941 --> 02:26:58.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THE PAPERWORK.

02:26:58.709 --> 02:27:00.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE ARE SO MANY DEMANDS AT

02:27:00.978 --> 02:27:02.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT POINT OF DELIVERY OF THE

02:27:02.413 --> 02:27:04.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINT OF SERVICE RIGHT NOW. DAY

02:27:04.415 --> 02:27:06.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CREATIVE THINKING IS THERE

02:27:06.484 --> 02:27:08.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AROUND HOW TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

02:27:08.252 --> 02:27:08.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE

02:27:08.886 --> 02:27:11.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EXAMPLE. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL

02:27:11.088 --> 02:27:13.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RECORD TECHNICALLY THAT ENDS UP

02:27:13.691 --> 02:27:15.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YET I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE LOT

02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:17.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ISSUES RELATED TO THAT BUT FROM.

02:27:17.762 --> 02:27:19.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
A FROM A WORK STANDPOINT.

02:27:19.163 --> 02:27:22.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT TAKES AWAY JOBS BECAUSE ALL

02:27:22.533 --> 02:27:23.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF A SUDDEN YOU DON'T NEED STAFF

02:27:23.534 --> 02:27:25.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO DEAL WITH FILES AND AND

02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:27.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RETRIEVING FILES AND THINGS LIKE

02:27:27.471 --> 02:27:28.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT IT'S ALL ELECTRONIC.

02:27:28.706 --> 02:27:30.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IT ASIAN

02:27:30.308 --> 02:27:32.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEALTH SERVICES WE'VE TAKEN AND

02:27:32.543 --> 02:27:34.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOOKED AT THE POOL OF FOLKS THAT

02:27:34.278 --> 02:27:35.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE WORKING IN MEDICAL RECORDS

02:27:35.613 --> 02:27:36.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
AND ABLE TO SHIFT

02:27:36.981 --> 02:27:38.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
RESPONSIBILITIES AROUND

02:27:38.549 --> 02:27:40.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INTERPRETATION AROUND CULTURAL

02:27:40.451 --> 02:27:42.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LINGUISTIC APPROACHES. AND

02:27:42.253 --> 02:27:44.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AROUND A COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND

02:27:44.655 --> 02:27:46.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAMS SO

02:27:46.657 --> 02:27:48.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THERE'S RE DIRECTION AND A

02:27:48.259 --> 02:27:49.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LITTLE BIT OF REAP WITH A LITTLE

02:27:49.427 --> 02:27:51.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BIT OF RETRAINING. AND HOSPITALS

02:27:51.729 --> 02:27:53.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION WHERE

02:27:53.331 --> 02:27:56.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS AS WE BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE HOW

02:27:56.234 --> 02:27:57.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND JUST THE

02:27:57.768 --> 02:27:59.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STRAIGHT MEDICAL MODEL AND NOW

02:27:59.337 --> 02:28:01.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE NEED TO ADDRESS NON CLINICAL

02:28:01.239 --> 02:28:03.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ISSUES. THAT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW

02:28:03.207 --> 02:28:04.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WILL INFLUENCE WHETHER OR NOT

02:28:04.775 --> 02:28:06.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PEOPLE NEED TO COME INTO THE

02:28:06.410 --> 02:28:07.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

02:28:07.211 --> 02:28:08.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEN THERE IS GOING TO BE A NEW

02:28:08.379 --> 02:28:10.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WORKFORCE THAT ENDS UP EVOLVING

02:28:10.514 --> 02:28:12.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM THAT AND WE ARE LOOK AT A

02:28:12.183 --> 02:28:14.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LIMITED CAPACITY CURRENTLY.

02:28:14.185 --> 02:28:15.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITHIN MOST OF OUR COMMUNITIES

02:28:15.653 --> 02:28:16.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE MOST OF THESE HAPPEN TO

02:28:16.954 --> 02:28:18.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BE SOCIAL SERVICES THAT DON'T

02:28:18.789 --> 02:28:20.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
GET THE TYPE OF UP PUBLIC

INTEREST TO AND.

02:28:21.592 --> 02:28:23.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POLICY SETTING AND THAT WE NEED

02:28:23.761 --> 02:28:24.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO ACTUALLY MOVE TO CREATING AND

02:28:24.895 --> 02:28:26.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STRENGTHENING THOSE KINDS OF

02:28:26.397 --> 02:28:27.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RESOURCES WHEN OUR WITHIN OUR

02:28:27.598 --> 02:28:29.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMMUNITIES AGAIN THAT'S WHAT

02:28:29.634 --> 02:28:31.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE SINGLE PAYER WOULD DO. AND

02:28:31.402 --> 02:28:32.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:28:32.336 --> 02:28:34.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONSOLIDATE A LOT OF THE SAVINGS

02:28:35.039 --> 02:28:36.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS

02:28:36.807 --> 02:28:38.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVOLUTION OF THE WAY WE PRACTICE

02:28:38.743 --> 02:28:41.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MEDICINE AND NOT IGNORING AND

02:28:41.178 --> 02:28:42.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SAYING THIS IS OF. THIS THIS IS

A DOCTOR'S OFFICE OR THIS IS A

MEDICAL OFFICE WE DON'T DEAL

02:28:45.449 --> 02:28:47.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH THAT PROBLEM BUT ACTUALLY

02:28:47.118 --> 02:28:49.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INTEGRATING OUR APPROACH AT THE

02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:50.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POINT A SERVICE LEVEL SO THAT WE

02:28:50.821 --> 02:28:53.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

THIS BEING THE CASE.

02:30:06.464 --> 02:30:07.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO NURSES

02:30:07.898 --> 02:30:09.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SALARIES BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK TO

02:30:09.166 --> 02:30:10.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

WANT TO GET TO THAT POINT SO

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:17.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
WHAT.

02:30:17.908 --> 02:30:18.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

THERE IS PLENTY OF MONEY WHERE

02:30:29.286 --> 02:30:30.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE PHYSICIANS WILL ACTUALLY NOT

SUFFER A LOSS OF INCOME AND

02:30:32.189 --> 02:30:33.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CERTAINLY THE REGISTERED NURSES

02:30:33.391 --> 02:30:34.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WILL NOT EITHER BECAUSE THE

02:30:34.625 --> 02:30:37.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROBLEM IS. WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW

02:30:37.328 --> 02:30:38.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IN THE IN THE CURRENT

02:30:38.696 --> 02:30:40.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENVIRONMENT IS WERE RESTRICTING

02:30:44.568 --> 02:30:46.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOCTOR LESS THAN THE AVERAGE FOR

02:30:46.737 --> 02:30:47.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIMILAR COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD

02:30:48.005 --> 02:30:49.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE HAVE SHORTER LENGTH OF STAYS

02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:51.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE USE LESS HEALTH CARE NOW. AND

02:30:51.609 --> 02:30:52.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE

02:30:52.843 --> 02:30:54.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BARRIERS TO CARE IF YOU LOOK AT

02:30:54.678 --> 02:30:56.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THESE INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS

02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:57.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT THE COMMONWEALTH FUND AND

02:30:57.481 --> 02:30:58.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OTHERS HAVE DONE THEY WILL TELL

02:30:58.716 --> 02:31:00.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU AMERICANS USE. A LITTLE BIT

02:31:00.918 --> 02:31:02.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LESS HEALTH CARE THAN AVERAGE

02:31:02.219 --> 02:31:04.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BUT WE PAY A LOT MORE OUR

02:31:04.755 --> 02:31:06.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROBLEM ARE THE PRICES NOT THE

02:31:06.490 --> 02:31:07.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SALARIES.

02:31:07.525 --> 02:31:09.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THE DOCTORS INCOME WILL NOT

02:31:09.493 --> 02:31:10.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GO DOWN BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE

02:31:10.494 --> 02:31:12.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PAYING EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A

YEAR FOR BILLING CLERKS SO

02:31:14.031 --> 02:31:15.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THAT IS A HUGE SAVINGS FOR

02:31:16.033 --> 02:31:17.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THEM.

02:31:17.868 --> 02:31:19.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEREFORE WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO

02:31:19.804 --> 02:31:21.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

02:33:48.819 --> 02:33:49.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS IN

02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:50.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
FRONT OF ME.

02:33:50.154 --> 02:33:52.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT I CERTAINLY YES JOBS WILL

02:33:52.523 --> 02:33:55.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BE LOST BECAUSE OF THAT OKAY BUT

02:33:55.292 --> 02:33:56.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNEW JOBS WILL BE CREATED. AND

02:33:57.061 --> 02:33:58.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MAKE A

02:33:58.128 --> 02:33:59.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRANSITION IN A HUMANE MANNER

02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:00.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
RETRAINING.

02:34:00.998 --> 02:34:02.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
EARLY RETIREMENT.

02:34:02.733 --> 02:34:04.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW SURE BUT THAT'S A FACT

02:34:04.234 --> 02:34:05.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I MEAN YES IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

02:34:05.636 --> 02:34:06.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WILL BE MORE

02:34:06.904 --> 02:34:08.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EFFICIENT. AND PEOPLE ARE

02:34:08.439 --> 02:34:10.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EMPLOYED RIGHT NOW IN THE SYSTEM

02:34:10.407 --> 02:34:11.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT IS HELPING MAKE IT ENOUGH.

02:34:11.909 --> 02:34:13.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE ONLY THERE BECAUSE IT IS

02:34:13.143 --> 02:34:14.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
INEFFICIENT

02:34:14.211 --> 02:34:16.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO YEAH WE'RE GONNA BUT DO ALSO

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WILL BE NEW JOBS CREATED.

02:34:17.648 --> 02:34:19.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND AND I GUESS THAT'S MY POINT

02:34:19.116 --> 02:34:20.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN

02:34:20.084 --> 02:34:21.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLAR SAVINGS

02:34:21.619 --> 02:34:23.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PER OFFICE BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE

02:34:23.087 --> 02:34:24.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WILL STILL BE A PART OF THE

02:34:24.421 --> 02:34:26.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

02:34:26.657 --> 02:34:29.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN ANOTHER POSITION AND MY IS

02:34:29.126 --> 02:34:30.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION.

02:34:30.594 --> 02:34:30.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
THOSE.

02:34:30.828 --> 02:34:32.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S ONE THING TO SAY YOU KNOW

02:34:33.063 --> 02:34:35.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THE PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE WILL

02:34:35.766 --> 02:34:38.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT BEAR THOSE COSTS ANYMORE.

02:34:38.535 --> 02:34:40.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT THE SYSTEM STILL MIGHT IF

02:34:40.104 --> 02:34:41.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
SYSTEM WILL BEAR.

02:34:41.305 --> 02:34:44.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SMALLER WORSHIP PORTION YEAH

02:34:44.174 --> 02:34:45.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND THEN THERE WILL BE.

02:34:45.376 --> 02:34:47.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
JOBS LOST AND THAT'S WHY WE I'VE

02:34:47.645 --> 02:34:48.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GONE THROUGH SOME OF THESE

02:34:48.879 --> 02:34:51.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROPOSALS FOR A JUST TRANSITION.

02:34:51.915 --> 02:34:54.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF PEOPLE I WHICH I DO BELIEVE

02:34:55.052 --> 02:34:56.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN ANY FINAL BILL SHOULD BE AN.

02:34:56.353 --> 02:34:57.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PORTENT COMPONENT OF THE OVERALL

02:34:57.688 --> 02:34:59.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
BILL.

02:34:59.289 --> 02:35:01.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I THINK THANK YOU JUST A.

02:35:01.225 --> 02:35:02.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK THE OTHER AND ANOTHER

02:35:02.459 --> 02:35:04.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GO KIND OF ANOTHER FOLLOW UP TO

02:35:04.428 --> 02:35:05.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WEAPONS WATER WAS SAYING ABOUT.

02:35:05.996 --> 02:35:07.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SERVICES AND AND YOU TALKED

02:35:07.331 --> 02:35:08.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
ABOUT TALKED ABOUT.

02:35:08.866 --> 02:35:10.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHAT WE LEARNED IN OUR VERY

02:35:10.534 --> 02:35:12.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
FIRST HEARING WAS THAT?

02:35:12.069 --> 02:35:13.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SINGLE

02:35:13.237 --> 02:35:14.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
PAYER.

02:35:14.571 --> 02:35:16.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SPEND A LOT MORE ON SOCIAL

02:35:16.373 --> 02:35:17.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SERVICES WHICH RELATES TO THE

02:35:18.008 --> 02:35:19.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
HEALTH OUTCOMES.

02:35:19.677 --> 02:35:21.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE GREATER HEALTH OUTCOMES

02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:25.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THINGS LIKE EDUCATION LIKE

02:35:25.516 --> 02:35:27.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRANSPORTATION ISSUES THERE BUT

02:35:27.251 --> 02:35:28.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT REALLY ISN'T ADDRESSED BY A

02:35:29.053 --> 02:35:30.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
CARE COORDINATOR.

02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:33.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT IT'S IF IT'S. IN MY PIGEON

02:35:34.024 --> 02:35:35.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO. IF WE'RE GONNA GET THOSE

02:35:35.893 --> 02:35:37.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BETTER BIGGER NO BETTER HEALTH

02:35:37.261 --> 02:35:39.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUTCOMES HOW DO WHERE IS THE IT

02:35:39.430 --> 02:35:41.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DISH NO MONEY COME FROM TO DO

02:35:41.298 --> 02:35:43.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT IF BECAUSE THAT. IS NOT

02:35:43.434 --> 02:35:45.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EXACTLY THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED

02:35:45.836 --> 02:35:46.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO US BY THE COMMONWEALTH.

02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:47.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WELL I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:35:47.571 --> 02:35:49.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNDERSTAND FIRST OF ALL OF THAT

02:35:49.306 --> 02:35:50.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE PRESENT SYSTEM HAS NO

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:51.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
ABILITY TO DO THAT.

02:35:51.975 --> 02:35:53.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO

02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:54.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMPARE THE PRESENT SYSTEM TO

02:35:54.712 --> 02:35:55.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THE ALTERNATIVES.

02:35:55.679 --> 02:35:57.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

02:35:57.815 --> 02:35:59.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO FOR. THE YOU'RE ACTUALLY

02:35:59.616 --> 02:36:00.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS IN IN

02:36:00.951 --> 02:36:02.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IS THEY HAVE

02:36:02.986 --> 02:36:05.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
A HIGH TAX AND FIRE MEANT

02:36:05.189 --> 02:36:06.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
USUALLY TO VALUE ADDED TAXES

02:36:07.024 --> 02:36:08.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH ARE KIND OF SALES TAX. AND

02:36:08.759 --> 02:36:10.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NAY COMPREHENSIVELY FUND SOCIAL

02:36:10.327 --> 02:36:12.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SERVICES

02:36:12.229 --> 02:36:13.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE ON THE OTHER HAND IN THE U.

02:36:13.163 --> 02:36:15.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
S. FUND THOSE SERVICES TO

02:36:15.232 --> 02:36:16.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
PRIVATE SPENDING.

02:36:16.867 --> 02:36:18.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE YOU KNOW EITHER OUR EMPLOYER

INDIVIDUALS BY THEM ON THEIR OWN

02:36:22.306 --> 02:36:23.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OR WE GET TAX SUBSIDIES TO

02:36:23.974 --> 02:36:25.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PURCHASE SOME SET OF THOSE

02:36:25.375 --> 02:36:26.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BENEFITS WHICH IN GENERAL ARE

02:36:26.944 --> 02:36:29.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT EQUIVALENT. TO THE EUROPEANS

02:36:29.213 --> 02:36:30.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUSTICE DOCTOR CHEN SAYS THE

02:36:31.014 --> 02:36:32.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH

02:36:32.449 --> 02:36:35.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF HEALTH

02:36:35.152 --> 02:36:37.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DISPARITIES ANNIE AND IN A

02:36:37.121 --> 02:36:38.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
QUALITY WE KNOW THE SIXTY

02:36:38.956 --> 02:36:40.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT OF AMERICANS HAVE TWO OR

02:36:40.691 --> 02:36:41.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS BY THE

02:36:41.925 --> 02:36:43.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TIME THEY'RE SIXTY FIVE. THAT

02:36:43.694 --> 02:36:44.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MEANS THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR

02:36:44.995 --> 02:36:46.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PREVENTIVE TREATMENT AND THE ON

02:36:46.330 --> 02:36:48.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOING CARE THAT THEY NEED. AND

02:36:48.632 --> 02:36:49.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH

02:36:49.166 --> 02:36:49.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
POVERTY.

02:36:50.033 --> 02:36:52.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INADEQUATE HOUSING NUTRITION SO

02:36:52.803 --> 02:36:53.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE CAN'T JUST TALK ABOUT HOW DO

02:36:53.771 --> 02:36:55.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
YOU. ADDRESS THE SOCIAL

02:36:55.072 --> 02:36:56.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THE

02:36:56.073 --> 02:36:57.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
QUESTIONS HOW DO YOUR RADICALLY

02:36:57.407 --> 02:36:59.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POVERTY SO WE HAVE TO GO KIND OF

02:36:59.076 --> 02:37:01.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TWO LEVELS BACK ULTIMATELY. AND

02:37:01.345 --> 02:37:02.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY BEYOND THE

02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:05.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCOPE OF S. B. FIVE SIX TO WHAT

02:37:05.115 --> 02:37:07.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE CAN DO IS WE CAN ELIMINATE

02:37:07.284 --> 02:37:09.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MEANS TESTING THAT CURRENTLY

02:37:09.386 --> 02:37:11.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PREVENTS THAT. PEOPLE WHO DON'T

02:37:11.655 --> 02:37:12.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTUALLY CAN'T AFFORD IT FROM

02:37:12.923 --> 02:37:14.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GETTING THE BENEFIT AND I DO

02:37:14.491 --> 02:37:16.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BE A

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LITTLE MORE AMBITIOUS AND I

02:37:17.995 --> 02:37:19.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE

02:37:19.563 --> 02:37:21.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO BE MORE AMBITIOUS. WE CAN

02:37:21.131 --> 02:37:22.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CREATE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

02:37:22.332 --> 02:37:23.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
BASED ON OUR VALUES.

02:37:23.967 --> 02:37:25.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHEAT FAVOR INTEGRATED MEDICINE

02:37:25.736 --> 02:37:27.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE FAVOR ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES

02:37:27.437 --> 02:37:29.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE FAVOR SUPPORT SERVICES AND

02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:32.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BROADER SOCIAL SPENDING WE FAVOR

02:37:32.409 --> 02:37:33.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A TRANSITION SO THE PEOPLE LEAD

02:37:34.044 --> 02:37:35.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HEALTHY LIVES NOT JUST GET

02:37:35.979 --> 02:37:37.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MEDICAL CARE FOR DISEASE.

02:37:37.614 --> 02:37:39.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S WHAT'S POSSIBLE HERE IF

02:37:39.416 --> 02:37:41.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU REORGANIZE THE SYSTEM IN

02:37:41.318 --> 02:37:42.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT KIND OF WAY THE FIVE SIX

02:37:42.486 --> 02:37:44.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TWO ENVISIONS YOU CAN TAKE WE

02:37:44.321 --> 02:37:45.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAN TAKE DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OVER

02:37:45.522 --> 02:37:47.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ON HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND

02:37:47.291 --> 02:37:48.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS I WOULD

02:37:48.392 --> 02:37:48.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ARGUE.

02:37:49.026 --> 02:37:51.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHAIRMAN WOULD MORE EFFECTIVELY

02:37:51.261 --> 02:37:52.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ADDRESS

02:37:52.296 --> 02:37:53.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THESE PROBLEMS THE QUESTIONS

02:37:53.230 --> 02:37:54.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT SYSTEM CAN BEST ADDRESS

02:37:55.065 --> 02:37:56.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THAT IS FIVE SIX TWO

02:37:56.266 --> 02:37:57.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMPREHENSIVELY PERFECT ON THESE

02:37:57.835 --> 02:37:59.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
QUESTIONS NOW NO IT IS NOT. IS

02:37:59.803 --> 02:38:01.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT THE BEST FOUNDATION TO DO

02:38:02.039 --> 02:38:07.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT WE BELIEVE IT IS.

02:38:07.978 --> 02:38:09.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR ON THE CARE

02:38:09.179 --> 02:38:10.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
COORDINATOR.

02:38:10.981 --> 02:38:12.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN FACT YES THEY WROTE THE ROLE

02:38:12.883 --> 02:38:14.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF CARE COORDINATORS YOU KNOW AT

02:38:14.952 --> 02:38:16.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALSO LABEL PATIENT NAVIGATORS

02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:18.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ALSO LABELED THE COMMUNITY

02:38:18.789 --> 02:38:20.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HEALTH WORKERS TO ALSO WERE

02:38:20.424 --> 02:38:22.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LABELED CASE MANAGERS. THAT

02:38:22.226 --> 02:38:23.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOCIAL SERVICE PERSON THERE'S A

02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:26.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHOLE FIELD RIGHT NOW THAT'S

02:38:26.196 --> 02:38:27.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EXPANDING AND THAT IS THIS AS

02:38:28.031 --> 02:38:29.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOCTORS INFUSE MENTIONING THAT

02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:31.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IS AN AREA OF CREATIVE JOB

02:38:31.468 --> 02:38:33.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GROWTH. THAT'S OCCURRING WITHIN

02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:35.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE HEALTH INDUSTRY WITHIN THEIR

02:38:35.305 --> 02:38:37.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HEALTH INDUSTRY AND THAT IT'S

02:38:37.241 --> 02:38:39.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAD SEEN AS A DEFINITE COMPONENT

02:38:39.376 --> 02:38:40.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND

02:38:41.011 --> 02:38:42.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:38:43.046 --> 02:38:44.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAPPENING AND THAT'LL BE AN AREA

02:38:44.581 --> 02:38:46.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR FOCUSING RETRAINING AND SO

02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:50.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ON. BUT IT IT ALSO BEGS THE

02:38:50.153 --> 02:38:53.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
POINT THAT I THINK.

02:40:25.082 --> 02:40:26.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT'S

02:40:26.683 --> 02:40:28.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
REALLY NOT TRUE.

02:40:28.185 --> 02:40:29.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I DON'T SEE HOW THAT COULD

02:40:29.586 --> 02:40:30.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%

02:40:42.599 --> 02:40:43.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE THINGS THAT REALLY ISN'T

02:40:43.734 --> 02:40:46.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADDRESSED IN FIVE SIXTY TWO. IS

02:40:46.436 --> 02:40:48.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

REALLY NOT A TRANSITION PLAN IN

02:40:54.344 --> 02:40:56.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE SO WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU

02:40:56.179 --> 02:40:58.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REASONABLY EXPECT. AS A TIME

02:40:58.181 --> 02:41:00.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
FRAME.

02:41:00.784 --> 02:41:01.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FROM THE PASSAGE OF A SINGLE

02:41:01.952 --> 02:41:03.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PAYER BILL IN CALIFORNIA TO THE

02:41:03.186 --> 02:41:05.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POINT WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE

COVERAGE IN THE WAY YOU ENVISION

02:41:06.623 --> 02:41:09.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IT.

02:41:09.793 --> 02:41:11.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE M. WE AGREE THERE IS A

02:41:11.395 --> 02:41:13.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRANSITION PERIOD AND THAT'S WHY

02:41:13.163 --> 02:41:14.698 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
WE'VE ASKED DOCTOR PULL INTO
THE.

02:41:14.765 --> 02:41:16.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
JILL DOWN AND EXAMINE THOSE

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:18.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ISSUES MORE SPECIFICALLY.

02:41:18.135 --> 02:41:20.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO FIGURE OUT. THAT THE COSTS

02:41:20.904 --> 02:41:22.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS HE'S DESCRIBE TODAY FROM THE

02:41:22.139 --> 02:41:23.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JOB MAYBE THE OTHER COSTS AS

02:41:23.607 --> 02:41:25.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WELL AND ALSO TIMELINE.

02:41:25.108 --> 02:41:26.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE BILL

02:41:26.410 --> 02:41:27.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DOES ENVISIONED NOT FULL

02:41:27.878 --> 02:41:29.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL THAT AND

02:41:29.646 --> 02:41:32.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FUNDS ARE CERTIFIED SUFFICIENT

02:41:32.149 --> 02:41:33.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TO OPERATE THE PROGRAM.

02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:36.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO THAT'S THE TRIGGER WHERE WE.

02:41:36.319 --> 02:41:37.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
GO LIVE WITH HEALTHY

02:41:37.554 --> 02:41:38.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CALIFORNIA'S THE FUNDS ARE

02:41:39.056 --> 02:41:39.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
SUFFICIENT THAT'S A

02:41:39.489 --> 02:41:41.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DETERMINATION. ULTIMATELY MADE

02:41:41.658 --> 02:41:44.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
BY BY THE BOARD WITH WITH
ADVICE.

02:41:44.661 --> 02:41:46.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE STAND

02:41:46.763 --> 02:41:48.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH THE BILL LANGUAGE TODAY.

02:41:49.032 --> 02:41:49.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
WHAT WE?

02:41:49.699 --> 02:41:52.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT IS TRUE THAT. WE'RE NOT

02:41:52.502 --> 02:41:53.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GONNA FLIP A SWITCH AND HAVE

02:41:53.637 --> 02:41:55.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GUARANTEED HEALTHCARE BUT I

02:41:55.472 --> 02:41:57.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT.

02:41:57.407 --> 02:41:58.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD JUST

02:41:58.341 --> 02:42:00.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WAIT FOR FEDERAL STATUTORY

02:42:00.243 --> 02:42:01.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CHANGESIS HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC

02:42:02.045 --> 02:42:03.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ONE BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED

02:42:03.647 --> 02:42:05.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STATUTORY CHANGES. THERE IS

02:42:05.682 --> 02:42:07.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EXISTING STATUTORY LANGUAGE

02:42:07.751 --> 02:42:09.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

THAT WAS VERY LIMITED AUTHORITY

02:42:14.391 --> 02:42:16.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

HOPEFUL ABOUT THAT WE ALSO

02:42:42.085 --> 02:42:43.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE AS

02:42:43.787 --> 02:42:45.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SENATOR KEWELL HAS SAID WAYS FOR

STAFF IN THE ASSEMBLY.

02:42:56.366 --> 02:42:58.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SO OUR VIEW IS IS THAT.

02:42:59.002 --> 02:43:01.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE CAN EITHER SIT BY AND LET THE

BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH ALL THE

02:43:14.885 --> 02:43:16.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
STATUTORY ADMINISTRATIVE

REQUIREMENTS. AND IF THEY DENY

02:43:18.321 --> 02:43:19.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT WE BELIEVE THERE'S A BASIS

02:43:19.222 --> 02:43:20.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
FOR LITIGATION.

02:43:20.290 --> 02:43:22.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
WE THINK IT'S WORTH

A FIGHT AND.

02:43:24.761 --> 02:43:27.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEAH THAT'S A POLITICAL CHOICE.

02:43:27.197 --> 02:43:28.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REALISTICALLY IF WERE ABLE IF

02:43:28.899 --> 02:43:31.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE DEMOCRATS ARE ABLE TO TAKE

02:43:31.401 --> 02:43:32.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%

CHANGES.

02:43:35.338 --> 02:43:37.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DRAMATICALLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE

02:43:37.507 --> 02:43:38.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH S. B. FIVE SIX TWO WE'VE

02:43:38.508 --> 02:43:40.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BEEN CRITICIZED FOR THIS WE HAVE

02:43:40.210 --> 02:43:41.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

02:43:41.778 --> 02:43:44.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BILL LIKE SP A. TEN. BECAUSE WE

02:43:44.181 --> 02:43:46.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BELIEVE THAT THE FEDERAL DYNAMIC

02:43:46.516 --> 02:43:48.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REQUIRES US CERTAIN LEVEL OF

02:43:48.451 --> 02:43:50.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FLEXIBILITY LAY THE FOUNDATION

02:43:50.453 --> 02:43:51.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SET THE BENEFITS SET THE

02:43:51.955 --> 02:43:54.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

FRAMEWORK AND FOUNDATION BASIC

02:43:56.426 --> 02:43:57.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRINCIPLES FOR THE PROGRAM BUT

02:43:57.961 --> 02:44:00.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GIVE THE BOARD THE POWER TO

02:44:00.363 --> 02:44:01.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RESPOND TO THE CHANGING FEDERAL

02:44:01.631 --> 02:44:02.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
CIRCUMSTANCE.

02:44:02.999 --> 02:44:04.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A LONG WAY OF SAYING WE DON'T

02:44:04.601 --> 02:44:05.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KNOW HOW LONG THE TRANSITIONS

02:44:05.969 --> 02:44:07.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO TAKE BUT WE KNOW IT'LL

AND I'M AND I DON'T YOU KNOW I.

02:44:17.614 --> 02:44:19.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE HEARD THAT THIS WOULD REQUIRE

02:44:19.349 --> 02:44:21.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A CHANGE IN FEDERAL LAW FOR

THAT THAT WOULD MEAN.

02:46:32.015 --> 02:46:34.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ANOTHER WE WOULD NEED ANOTHER

02:46:34.317 --> 02:46:35.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FIFTEEN BILLION IN RESERVE TO

02:46:35.752 --> 02:46:37.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COVER. THAT THAT WOULD BE THE

02:46:37.687 --> 02:46:39.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOOD YEAR UP FIVE PERCENT TO

02:46:39.556 --> 02:46:41.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COVER THAT DID DOWN YEAR OF FIVE

02:46:41.157 --> 02:46:42.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PERCENT SO WE WOULD NEED

02:46:42.525 --> 02:46:44.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SOMETHING. IN THE RANGE OF

02:46:44.627 --> 02:46:46.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
FIFTEEN BILLION.

02:46:46.363 --> 02:46:48.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WOULDN'T RELATIVE TO AT THREE

02:46:48.932 --> 02:46:50.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION SYSTEM.

02:46:50.667 --> 02:46:51.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE

02:46:51.835 --> 02:46:53.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD YOU SEE THAT COMING FROM

02:46:53.069 --> 02:46:54.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

02:46:54.237 --> 02:46:56.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OVERTIME NOW LET'S NOT TALK

02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:57.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT YOUR ONE I MENTIONED HERE

02:46:57.774 --> 02:46:58.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
ONCE OTHER WOULDN'T

02:46:58.541 --> 02:47:00.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO YOU WOULDN'T YOU WOULDN'T

02:47:00.176 --> 02:47:01.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROPOSE HAVING. SORT CASH ON

02:47:01.811 --> 02:47:04.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAND YEAH I WOULD A AND HOW SO

02:47:04.414 --> 02:47:05.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOW MUCH YEAH HOW MY SO WE SO

02:47:05.515 --> 02:47:07.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BASICALLY YOU KNOW LET'S TAKE A

02:47:07.350 --> 02:47:08.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
TEN YEAR PERIOD.

02:47:08.685 --> 02:47:10.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEN I'LL COME BACK TO YOU

02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:11.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
OKAY SO.

02:47:11.554 --> 02:47:13.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IN YOU IT OVER THE TEN YEAR

02:47:13.490 --> 02:47:15.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
PERIOD IF WE BELIEVE.

02:47:15.892 --> 02:47:18.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT LONG TERM TRENDS OUR ARE

02:47:18.194 --> 02:47:19.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE SHOWING US SOMETHING SO SOME

02:47:19.996 --> 02:47:21.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEARS WE GO UP FIVE PERCENT SOME

02:47:21.998 --> 02:47:23.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEARS WE GO DOWN FIVE PERCENT

02:47:23.633 --> 02:47:24.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND WE NEED THREE HUNDRED AND

02:47:24.934 --> 02:47:26.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THIRTY BILLION PER YEAR ON

02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:28.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AVERAGE. SO IN THE YEARS WHEN WE

02:47:28.972 --> 02:47:31.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GET INSTEAD OF THREE THIRTY WE

02:47:31.341 --> 02:47:33.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GET THREE FORTY FIVE BILLION OR

02:47:33.176 --> 02:47:35.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LET'S SAY THREE FIFTY BILLION WE

02:47:35.712 --> 02:47:37.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GRABBED THE TWENTY BILLION.

02:47:37.313 --> 02:47:39.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WE DON'T NEED TO FUND THE

02:47:39.115 --> 02:47:40.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEM AND WE PUT IT IN RESERVE.

02:47:40.817 --> 02:47:42.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND THAT WOULD BE A NUFF TO

02:47:43.052 --> 02:47:45.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COVER THE YEARS WHEN WE GO DOWN

02:47:45.188 --> 02:47:47.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM THREE THIRTY TO THREE TEN

02:47:47.624 --> 02:47:49.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND REVENUE SO THAT'S THE LONG

02:47:49.592 --> 02:47:50.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
TERM FUNDING.

02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:53.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WOULD BE ADEQUATE NOW THAT

02:47:53.096 --> 02:47:54.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOES NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION

02:47:54.898 --> 02:47:56.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT LET'S SAY WE START OUT IN

02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:58.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YEAR ONE INSTEAD OF RAISING

02:47:58.067 --> 02:48:00.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THREE THIRTY RIGHT AND YOUR TO.

02:48:00.437 --> 02:48:01.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WEAR DOWN TO THREE TEN.

02:48:01.971 --> 02:48:04.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO THAT MEANS THAT WE WOULD

02:48:04.107 --> 02:48:06.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEED TO FOUR YEAR ONE WE WOULD

02:48:06.576 --> 02:48:08.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HAVE TO HAVE. THIS TWENTY

02:48:08.378 --> 02:48:09.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BILLION ADDITIONAL TWENTY

02:48:09.379 --> 02:48:10.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BILLION IN RESERVE SO WE WOULD

02:48:10.814 --> 02:48:13.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NEED TO EXPAND THE FIRST YEAR

02:48:13.183 --> 02:48:15.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REVENUE TO COVER THAT BUT OVER

02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:17.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TIME THE THIS SYSTEM FUNDS

02:48:17.454 --> 02:48:19.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ITSELF BASED ON THE AVERAGE

02:48:19.355 --> 02:48:22.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEVEL. OF TAXES ARE FEE REVENUE.

02:48:22.258 --> 02:48:24.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN WE HAVE THE

02:48:24.761 --> 02:48:26.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOOD YEARS YOU CAN'T LIKE SAY

02:48:26.429 --> 02:48:28.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALL GREAT NAY HERE WE HAVE EXTRA

02:48:28.698 --> 02:48:30.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MONEY LET'S START SPENDING IT.

02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:32.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOU WOULD

02:48:32.135 --> 02:48:33.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAVE TO PUT IT IN RESERVE.

02:48:33.736 --> 02:48:35.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEN I GUESS WHAT I AS I READ I

02:48:35.905 --> 02:48:37.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
READ YOUR STUDY MULTIPLE TIME

02:48:37.841 --> 02:48:38.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THANK YOU AND.

02:48:38.174 --> 02:48:39.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:48:40.009 --> 02:48:43.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I'M SURE WAS GREAT REUNION.

02:48:43.313 --> 02:48:43.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EACH TIME YOU PICK UP A LITTLE

02:48:43.913 --> 02:48:45.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
BIT MORE.

02:48:45.081 --> 02:48:46.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BUT BUT IT LEFT ME WITH

02:48:46.149 --> 02:48:47.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
QUESTIONS AND AND ONE OF THE

02:48:47.650 --> 02:48:50.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
QUESTIONS IS IT FEELS LIKE.

02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:51.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND AND I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH

02:48:51.421 --> 02:48:52.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MENTION THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT

02:48:52.222 --> 02:48:53.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE TWO POINT THREE PERCENT

02:48:53.456 --> 02:48:54.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GROSS RECEIPTS TAX NOW THERE IS

02:48:54.757 --> 02:48:56.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A TWO POINT THREE PERCENT SALES

02:48:56.159 --> 02:48:57.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
TAX RIGHT.

02:48:57.827 --> 02:48:59.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHICH IS WHICH IS OUT THERE AS

02:48:59.429 --> 02:49:00.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL SO YEAH BUT THAT WOULD MAKE

02:49:00.930 --> 02:49:02.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SURE THAT THAT THAT DIDN'T COME

02:49:02.131 --> 02:49:03.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OUT AS MUCH AS YOU TALK ABOUT

02:49:03.266 --> 02:49:04.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE REGRET WE TALKED IN DETAIL

02:49:04.634 --> 02:49:05.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ABOUT GROSS RECEIPTS YEAH.

02:49:06.035 --> 02:49:07.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO THIS FEELS TIMMY MORE LIKE A

02:49:07.470 --> 02:49:10.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
SNAPSHOT IN TIME.

02:49:10.139 --> 02:49:12.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND SO MY QUESTION IS.

02:49:12.575 --> 02:49:14.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE NO BECAUSE OF THE REPUBLICANS

02:49:14.511 --> 02:49:15.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TAX PLAN IS SUPPOSED TO HELP US

02:49:15.778 --> 02:49:16.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ALL.

02:49:16.446 --> 02:49:18.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THAT

02:49:18.248 --> 02:49:19.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ONE OF THE THINGS IS ALREADY

02:49:19.782 --> 02:49:21.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BEING TALKED ABOUT IS A DECREASE

02:49:21.584 --> 02:49:22.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IN MEDICARE A DECREASE IN

02:49:22.719 --> 02:49:25.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
MEDICAID.

02:49:25.655 --> 02:49:26.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
WE KNOW THAT.

02:49:27.056 --> 02:49:31.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OVER TIME IN ADDITION TO YEAH I

02:49:31.194 --> 02:49:32.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AT THIS SNAPSHOT IN TIME.

02:49:32.562 --> 02:49:34.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COSTS IN EVERY SYSTEM IN THE

02:49:34.297 --> 02:49:35.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WORLD WHETHER SINGLE PAYER NOT

02:49:35.865 --> 02:49:37.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
CONTINUE TO RISE.

02:49:37.967 --> 02:49:39.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PERIOD. THERE ISN'T IT'S NOT

02:49:39.636 --> 02:49:41.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
STATIC AND MEAN.

02:49:41.404 --> 02:49:42.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I GO TO THE I GO THE GROCERY

02:49:42.872 --> 02:49:43.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STORE AND THINGS ARE MORE AND

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:45.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
MORE EXPENSIVE.

02:49:45.775 --> 02:49:48.344 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
SO BY ONE YOU KNOW I'M
WONDERING.

02:49:48.411 --> 02:49:50.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN FACTORED IN

02:49:50.079 --> 02:49:51.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN SHOWING.

02:49:51.714 --> 02:49:53.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AN AMAZING EXPANSION IN OUR

02:49:53.182 --> 02:49:54.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ECONOMY HERE THAT ISN'T GOING TO

02:49:54.551 --> 02:49:56.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
LAST FOREVER.

02:49:56.386 --> 02:49:58.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO. IF WE HAVE A DIP IN THE

02:49:58.721 --> 02:50:00.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ECONOMY IF WE HAVE REDUCTION IN

02:50:00.857 --> 02:50:01.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL

02:50:01.591 --> 02:50:02.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOVERNMENT IF WE HAVE INCREASED

02:50:03.059 --> 02:50:04.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
COSTS.

02:50:04.727 --> 02:50:06.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHERE DO WE GET I DON'T KNOW I

02:50:06.863 --> 02:50:09.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DON'T KNOW THAT THAT STATIC UP

02:50:09.132 --> 02:50:10.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND DOWN OF JUST WHAT YOU'RE

02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:11.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TALKING ABOUT THERE IS ENOUGH TO

02:50:12.035 --> 02:50:13.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COVER THIS WHERE WE GET THE

02:50:13.870 --> 02:50:15.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
ADDITIONAL REVENUE?

02:50:15.538 --> 02:50:16.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOW DO WE DO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S

02:50:16.940 --> 02:50:18.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT SORT OF STRUGGLING WITH

02:50:18.174 --> 02:50:20.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ANYA AND IN YOUR ANALYSIS?

02:50:20.310 --> 02:50:23.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'M SO YEAH THE THE EXACTLY IT'S

02:50:23.179 --> 02:50:24.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A AYE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

02:50:24.247 --> 02:50:26.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT OUR STUDY SHOWS BASICALLY

02:50:26.349 --> 02:50:27.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
IS A SNAPSHOT.

02:50:27.884 --> 02:50:30.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND A BUT WHAT WEEK IT'S EASY TO

02:50:30.653 --> 02:50:30.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
INCORPORATE.

02:50:30.954 --> 02:50:33.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:50:33.222 --> 02:50:35.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
SO THE THE FACT THAT THE
ECONOMY.

02:50:35.992 --> 02:50:37.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WILL GROW OVER TIME WIT WE WILL

02:50:37.860 --> 02:50:39.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BY THE WAY WE WE WILL HAVE A

02:50:39.262 --> 02:50:40.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RECESSION I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S

02:50:40.863 --> 02:50:42.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING TO BE A BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE

02:50:42.432 --> 02:50:44.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
RECESSIONS.

02:50:44.067 --> 02:50:46.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
WE HAVE NOT ABOLISHED
RECESSIONS.

02:50:46.069 --> 02:50:47.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO THERE WILL BE A RECESSION AND

02:50:47.837 --> 02:50:49.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
REVENUE WILL GO DOWN.

02:50:50.039 --> 02:50:51.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND IT WON'T BE THE FIRST TIME

02:50:51.774 --> 02:50:53.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IT'S HAPPENED MANY TIMES IT

02:50:53.142 --> 02:50:54.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAPPENS IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY

02:50:54.911 --> 02:50:56.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THAT ALSO HAVE.

02:50:56.179 --> 02:50:57.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THESE PUBLICLY FUNDED

02:50:57.580 --> 02:50:59.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS SO YES YOU

02:50:59.916 --> 02:51:00.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NEED A RESERVE FUND TO COVER

02:51:00.850 --> 02:51:03.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT. OVERTIME ON AVERAGE THE U.

02:51:03.353 --> 02:51:04.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
S. ECONOMY ADVANCED ECONOMIES

02:51:04.988 --> 02:51:06.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
GROW.

02:51:06.789 --> 02:51:07.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

02:51:07.223 --> 02:51:09.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THROUGH GROWTH WE WILL GENERATE

02:51:09.592 --> 02:51:11.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADDITIONAL REVENUE THAT WILL BE

02:51:12.028 --> 02:51:14.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE GROWTH

02:51:14.664 --> 02:51:15.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN THE POPULATION NOW YOU ALSO

02:51:15.798 --> 02:51:17.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SAID COSTS WILL RISE.

02:51:17.834 --> 02:51:19.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS THAT

02:51:19.168 --> 02:51:21.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
COSTS WILL NOT RISE OVER?

02:51:21.337 --> 02:51:23.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE WILL A BE CONTROLLED.

02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:26.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COSTS ARE RISING IN BY THE HUESO

02:51:26.609 --> 02:51:28.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RIGHT NOW ON THE U. S. ECONOMY.

02:51:28.111 --> 02:51:29.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE'RE PAYING ABOUT EIGHTEEN

02:51:29.379 --> 02:51:31.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERCENT OF GDP FOR HEALTH CARE

02:51:31.080 --> 02:51:32.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CMS

02:51:32.348 --> 02:51:33.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
PROJECTIONS.

02:51:34.017 --> 02:51:35.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THEY SHOW IT GOING UP

02:51:35.518 --> 02:51:37.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ARE YOU KNOW.

02:51:38.021 --> 02:51:39.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WITH OBAMACARE IN WITH OF

02:51:39.455 --> 02:51:40.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHATEVER CONTROLS THEY HAD IN IT

02:51:41.057 --> 02:51:43.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UP THIS IS COMPLETELY UNTENABLE

02:51:43.793 --> 02:51:45.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY'RE TALKING IF YOU LOOK OF

02:51:45.361 --> 02:51:47.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
CMS PROJECTIONS.

02:51:47.130 --> 02:51:48.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I INTEND YEARS WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:51:48.164 --> 02:51:50.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SPENDING TWENTY PERCENT OF GDP.

02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:52.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ON HEALTHCARE.

02:51:52.702 --> 02:51:55.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE DOLLARS.

02:51:55.471 --> 02:51:56.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE AT

02:51:57.006 --> 02:51:58.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
ROUGHLY HALF THAT

02:51:58.841 --> 02:52:00.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO

02:52:00.176 --> 02:52:02.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
TRILLION DOLLARS.

02:52:02.211 --> 02:52:03.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF OUR

02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:05.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CONNIE AND EQUIVALENT FOR

02:52:05.248 --> 02:52:06.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CALIFORNIA SO WE MUST CONTROL

02:52:06.449 --> 02:52:07.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
COSTS

02:52:07.950 --> 02:52:09.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND AND I THINK THAT THE THIS

02:52:09.852 --> 02:52:11.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE.

02:52:11.721 --> 02:52:13.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SUGGESTED THROUGH A HEALTHY

02:52:13.856 --> 02:52:17.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CALIFORNIA WILL ENABLE VERY OF

02:52:17.193 --> 02:52:19.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE'D BE SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT

02:52:19.095 --> 02:52:20.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COST CONTROLS IN THE AREA OF

02:52:20.930 --> 02:52:22.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ADMINISTRATION AND THE AREA

02:52:22.398 --> 02:52:24.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FARMER AND IN THE AREA OF OF

02:52:24.634 --> 02:52:27.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REDUCING. WASTE THIS AREA THAT

02:52:27.570 --> 02:52:29.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
YOU KNOW THE.

02:52:29.072 --> 02:52:31.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HA HA INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE HAS

02:52:31.441 --> 02:52:31.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
SAID.

02:52:31.941 --> 02:52:34.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS AT ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF

02:52:34.277 --> 02:52:36.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ALL SYSTEM COSTS RIGHT NOW.

02:52:36.579 --> 02:52:37.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO YOU DON'T BELIEVE THERE WILL

02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:39.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BE AN ADDITIONAL NEED FOR

02:52:39.248 --> 02:52:40.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADDITIONAL TAX REVENUE TAX THAT

02:52:40.349 --> 02:52:41.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DITCH Y..

02:52:41.818 --> 02:52:44.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NO NO NO NO NO NOT PERCENT NOT

02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:46.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS YES BECAUSE

02:52:46.489 --> 02:52:48.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE ECONOMY GOES UP POPULATION

02:52:48.357 --> 02:52:49.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE OF. THAT AS A SHARE OF

02:52:49.792 --> 02:52:52.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE ECONOMY NO NO I THINK ILL GO

02:52:53.062 --> 02:52:55.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DOWN. HOW IN FACT YOU KNOW WE

02:52:55.164 --> 02:52:56.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF OF

02:52:57.066 --> 02:52:59.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR STUDY IS TO HAPPEN YOU NOT?

02:52:59.702 --> 02:53:01.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A PUSHING DOWN COSTS MORE SO

02:53:01.704 --> 02:53:03.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE CANADA OR

02:53:03.206 --> 02:53:04.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
FRANCE

02:53:04.073 --> 02:53:05.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UNDER OUR PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW

02:53:05.942 --> 02:53:07.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CALIFORNIA'S SPENDING ABOUT

02:53:07.577 --> 02:53:08.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOURTEEN PERCENT OF STATE GDP ON

02:53:09.045 --> 02:53:10.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
HEALTHCARE.

02:53:10.580 --> 02:53:12.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNDER OUR PROPOSAL IS VERY IS

02:53:12.815 --> 02:53:15.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACTUALLY PRETTY MODEST REDUCTION

02:53:15.318 --> 02:53:15.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
WOULD BE AROUND.

02:53:15.718 --> 02:53:17.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TWELVE FOR TWELVE AND A HALF

02:53:17.487 --> 02:53:19.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PERCENT WHEREAS YOU KNOW THE

02:53:19.622 --> 02:53:21.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OTHER ADVANCED ECONOMIES ARE AT

02:53:21.224 --> 02:53:22.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NINE TO ELEVEN PERCENT SO.

02:53:22.959 --> 02:53:24.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACTUALLYARE COST SAVINGS WHICH

02:53:24.727 --> 02:53:26.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK ARE TOTALLY VIABLE ARE

02:53:26.763 --> 02:53:28.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
FAIRLY MODEST.

02:53:28.698 --> 02:53:29.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I GUESS AND I AND IF I GO BACK

02:53:29.565 --> 02:53:30.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
TO MY.

02:53:30.833 --> 02:53:31.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN THE EARLIER PART OF THAT IS

02:53:31.667 --> 02:53:33.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

02:53:33.770 --> 02:53:34.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHEN I PREFACE THIS QUESTION

02:53:34.704 --> 02:53:36.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
WITH WITH.

02:53:36.339 --> 02:53:37.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE ALREADY KNOW THE FEDERAL

02:53:37.640 --> 02:53:39.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO REDUCE THE

02:53:39.308 --> 02:53:41.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FUNDING FOR MEDICARE AND

02:53:41.244 --> 02:53:43.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MEDICAID NO. THAT MEANS LESS

02:53:43.713 --> 02:53:45.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MONEY YEAH THAT'S A LOWER NUMBER

02:53:45.782 --> 02:53:47.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO WHERE IS THE DIFFERENCE COME

02:53:47.650 --> 02:53:49.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM HIM OVERTIME BECAUSE IT'S

02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:51.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
NOT GOING TO BE.

02:53:51.320 --> 02:53:52.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S LIKE TO BE A ONE SHOT DEAL

02:53:52.421 --> 02:53:54.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I I PREDICT IT'LL BE IT IS IT IS

02:53:54.357 --> 02:53:56.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LIKELY TO GO DOWN IN INCREMENTS

02:53:56.125 --> 02:53:58.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OVER TIME. SO WHERE DOES THE

02:53:58.361 --> 02:54:01.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ADDITIONAL REVENUE COME FROM.

02:54:01.097 --> 02:54:03.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO KEEP THE SYSTEM HOLE. RIGHT

02:54:03.266 --> 02:54:04.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS THAT IT IS ADDING ITSELF MEAN

02:54:05.001 --> 02:54:06.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INCREASE SOMETIMES A SON NOW

02:54:06.669 --> 02:54:09.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
LET'S. NOW THESE OF.

02:54:09.272 --> 02:54:10.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PUBLIC FUNDING CONSTITUTE

02:54:10.740 --> 02:54:12.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SEVENTY PERCENT OF ALL SPENDING.

02:54:12.475 --> 02:54:14.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO ITS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY

02:54:14.677 --> 02:54:15.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
FIVE BILLION.

02:54:15.478 --> 02:54:18.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CAN OKAY SO IF IF THEY'RE YOU

02:54:18.281 --> 02:54:20.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
KNOW TAX CUTS.

02:54:20.082 --> 02:54:22.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WILL LEAD TO A REDUCTION

02:54:22.351 --> 02:54:24.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND FEDERAL REVENUES FOR

02:54:24.086 --> 02:54:25.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID OR

02:54:25.955 --> 02:54:27.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MEDICARE HOW. OF YEAH THOSE

02:54:27.623 --> 02:54:28.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPENSATED

02:54:28.658 --> 02:54:30.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOURTH THROUGH AN INCREASE IN

02:54:30.226 --> 02:54:32.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STATE BUT NOTE THAT THAT DOESN'T

02:54:32.161 --> 02:54:33.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
MEAN THAT OVERALL TAX

02:54:33.529 --> 02:54:34.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OBLIGATIONS WOULD GO UP AND WE

02:54:34.997 --> 02:54:35.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
JUST MEAN.

02:54:35.898 --> 02:54:38.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
TAX CUTS.

02:54:38.134 --> 02:54:39.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THAT WERE.

02:54:39.068 --> 02:54:42.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PUT IN PLACE TO REDUCE FEDERAL

02:54:42.772 --> 02:54:46.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REVENUE FOR MEDI CAL MEDICARE.

02:54:46.242 --> 02:54:48.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD THEN JUST BE COMPENSATED

02:54:48.344 --> 02:54:50.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BY A AN INCREMENTAL INCREASE

02:54:50.913 --> 02:54:53.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AND A STATE FUNDING.

02:54:53.549 --> 02:54:55.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHICH WOULD BE ADDITIONAL TAXES

02:54:55.918 --> 02:54:58.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NO NOT NOT ON NET IT WOULD JUST

02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:00.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BE. WHEN YOUR FEDERAL TAX.

02:55:00.423 --> 02:55:03.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BILL GOES DOWN THEN THE STATE

02:55:03.226 --> 02:55:04.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOULD HAVE TO GO UP TO MATCH THE

02:55:04.694 --> 02:55:06.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LOSSES OF FEDERAL REVENUE

02:55:06.295 --> 02:55:07.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SO ON BALANCE IT WOULD BE

02:55:07.096 --> 02:55:09.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
NEUTRAL.

02:55:09.699 --> 02:55:12.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND. I CAN I JUST ADD THAT YOU

02:55:12.535 --> 02:55:14.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
KNOW YOUR QUESTION I THINK

02:55:14.237 --> 02:55:16.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNDERSCORES THE COMPLEXITY OF.

02:55:16.672 --> 02:55:18.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND.

02:55:18.641 --> 02:55:20.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW EVEN BEYOND AND SB

02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:22.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
FIVE SIXTY TWO.

02:55:22.378 --> 02:55:24.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU'RE ASKING AT LEAST YOU KNOW

02:55:24.547 --> 02:55:26.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN PART A TECHNICAL QUESTION BUT

02:55:26.148 --> 02:55:27.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEN ALSO A POLITICAL QUESTION

02:55:27.783 --> 02:55:30.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE THE PIE IT'S ONLY AS BIG

02:55:30.119 --> 02:55:32.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS THE PEOPLE SUPPORT THAT PIE.

02:55:32.521 --> 02:55:34.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO YES THERE'S AN UPSTREAM

02:55:34.490 --> 02:55:36.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PART OF THAT BATTLE AS TO WHY

02:55:36.425 --> 02:55:38.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WOULD WE BE CUTTING BACK ON

02:55:38.094 --> 02:55:39.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. IF IN

02:55:40.029 --> 02:55:42.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FACT WE HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE ON

02:55:42.365 --> 02:55:43.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ADDRESSED YOU KNOW AND AND

02:55:43.866 --> 02:55:44.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EVOLUTION OF OUR HEALTHCARE

02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:46.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SYSTEM.

02:55:46.235 --> 02:55:47.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT REALLY DEMANDS YOU KNOW

02:55:47.904 --> 02:55:49.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
MORE FUNDING FOR THOSE

02:55:49.205 --> 02:55:50.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PARTICULAR PARTS OF OUR

02:55:50.506 --> 02:55:52.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POPULATION THE ELDERLY AND ALSO

02:55:52.875 --> 02:55:53.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

02:55:53.309 --> 02:55:55.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE POOR BUT IN ADDITION TO

02:55:55.211 --> 02:55:56.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT YOU KNOW FOR A LONG TIME

02:55:56.679 --> 02:55:57.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'VE KNOWN FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH

02:55:57.780 --> 02:55:59.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STANDPOINT. THAT WE DON'T INVEST

02:55:59.982 --> 02:56:01.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
ENOUGH IN PREVENTION

02:56:01.617 --> 02:56:02.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
NOW IN THIS COUNTRY.

02:56:02.685 --> 02:56:04.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ANYONE WHO'S IN HEALTH CARE

02:56:04.553 --> 02:56:05.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
UNDERSTANDS THAT WE INSTEAD

02:56:05.554 --> 02:56:07.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
INVEST.

02:56:07.189 --> 02:56:09.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND SICK CARE.

02:56:09.725 --> 02:56:11.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR THE

02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:13.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR LACK OF GOOD POLICY IN AND

02:56:13.663 --> 02:56:15.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
INVESTMENT IN PREVENTION SO
THAT.

02:56:16.065 --> 02:56:17.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT DOESN'T GO AWAY WE STILL

02:56:17.633 --> 02:56:19.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT WHILE

02:56:19.101 --> 02:56:21.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE'RE DEALING WITH. ADVANCES

02:56:21.103 --> 02:56:22.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUCH AS SINGLE PAYER THAT'LL

02:56:22.638 --> 02:56:24.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GIVE US NOT US MORE INVESTMENT

02:56:24.941 --> 02:56:26.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND AND BE ABLE TO A POLLING AND

02:56:26.809 --> 02:56:28.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MORE DOLLARS IN ADDRESSING THE

02:56:28.277 --> 02:56:29.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOWNSTREAM BUT THEN ALSO PAYING

02:56:29.745 --> 02:56:31.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ATTENTION TO THE UPSTREAM ISSUES

02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:32.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WE JUST WE HAVE TO DO THAT.

02:56:33.015 --> 02:56:34.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY'VE BEEN

02:56:34.383 --> 02:56:36.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABLE TO LEVEL OUT THE COST CURVE

02:56:36.686 --> 02:56:37.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY HAVE THAT INVESTMENT IN

02:56:37.987 --> 02:56:39.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOCIAL SERVICES AND MANY OTHER

02:56:39.555 --> 02:56:41.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AREAS THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER

02:56:41.324 --> 02:56:42.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
AND SO.

02:56:42.692 --> 02:56:44.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE GOTTA KEEP THAT IN MIND THE

02:56:44.093 --> 02:56:44.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CHAIRMAN WOULD IF I COULD

02:56:44.627 --> 02:56:45.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
QUICKLY.

02:56:46.062 --> 02:56:47.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE STILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THOSE

02:56:47.830 --> 02:56:48.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN IF THEY

02:56:48.898 --> 02:56:51.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
HAPPEN.

02:56:51.233 --> 02:56:52.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM DO WE HAVE

02:56:52.335 --> 02:56:54.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO RESPOND AS THE PRESENT SYSTEM

02:56:54.337 --> 02:56:56.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHERE SO MUCH MONEY IS DIVERTED

02:56:56.072 --> 02:56:57.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO WASTE INEFFICIENCY PROFITS

02:56:57.840 --> 02:56:59.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MARKETING? IS THAT SYSTEM BETTER

02:56:59.642 --> 02:57:01.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ABLE TO ABSORB THE CHANGES AT

02:57:01.811 --> 02:57:03.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FEDERAL LEVEL OR IS A SYSTEM

02:57:03.546 --> 02:57:04.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHERE CALIFORNIA'S DESIGNED OUR

02:57:04.780 --> 02:57:07.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OWN. GUARANTEES HEALTHCARE IT'S

02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:09.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNDER OUR CONTROL SO I THINK YOU

02:57:09.418 --> 02:57:10.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ALWAYS HAVE TO RELATE THOSE.

02:57:10.853 --> 02:57:11.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
POLITICALLY I DRAW THE

02:57:11.921 --> 02:57:13.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CONCLUSION THAT MEDICAID IS

02:57:13.489 --> 02:57:14.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
NEVER BEEN MORE POPULAR

02:57:14.557 --> 02:57:16.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MEDICARE'S NEVER BEEN MORE

02:57:16.325 --> 02:57:18.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POPULAR THERE WILL AYE AYE AYE

02:57:18.327 --> 02:57:19.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AIR ON THE OTHER SIDE I THINK

02:57:19.528 --> 02:57:20.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO

02:57:20.229 --> 02:57:21.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
SUCCESSFULLY FOR.

02:57:21.630 --> 02:57:23.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FIGHT THOSE CUTS AND EXPAND

02:57:23.466 --> 02:57:24.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THOSE PROGRAMS THAT'S RIGHT

02:57:24.533 --> 02:57:27.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THINK IT'S GOING TO GO.

02:57:27.203 --> 02:57:28.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN AND OUT HOW I JUST ONE MORE

02:57:28.371 --> 02:57:30.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
QUESTION AND I'M FIRST ONE THANK

02:57:30.373 --> 02:57:31.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

02:57:31.273 --> 02:57:32.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
AYE I'D.

02:57:32.808 --> 02:57:34.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I DO TEND TO DIVE DEEP INTO

02:57:34.677 --> 02:57:35.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THINGS AND SO THESE ARE THE

02:57:36.012 --> 02:57:37.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINGS TO KEEP ME AWAKE AT NIGHT

02:57:37.079 --> 02:57:38.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
WONDERING AND.

02:57:38.781 --> 02:57:40.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT

02:57:40.750 --> 02:57:41.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHEN ONE OF THINGS WE HEARD

02:57:41.917 --> 02:57:43.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HEARD AND SEEN WITH COUNTRIES

02:57:43.786 --> 02:57:45.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT HAVE SINGLE PAYER. IS A

02:57:45.554 --> 02:57:47.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
VERY DIFFERENT WORKFORCE.

02:57:48.024 --> 02:57:49.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SEVENTY PERCENT OF POSITIONS IN

02:57:49.959 --> 02:57:51.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A SINGLE PAYER COUNTRIES ARE

02:57:51.193 --> 02:57:53.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. AND

02:57:53.129 --> 02:57:54.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIRTY PERCENT OF SPECIALISTS

02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:55.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE IN THE

02:57:55.965 --> 02:57:57.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
UNITED STATES.

02:57:57.933 --> 02:58:00.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO. AND ALSO IN SINGLE PAYER

02:58:00.369 --> 02:58:01.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COUNTRIES A LOT OF THEM THEIR

02:58:01.570 --> 02:58:04.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EDUCATION IS SUBSIDIZED IN SOME

02:58:04.306 --> 02:58:05.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WAY BY THE GOVERNMENT WHICH

02:58:05.708 --> 02:58:07.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALLOWS FOR IN IN SPITE OF WHAT.

02:58:07.443 --> 02:58:08.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY DO HAVE LOWER SALARIES I

02:58:08.744 --> 02:58:09.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MEAN THAT'S THAT'S EVERY

02:58:10.012 --> 02:58:11.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INFORMATION WE HAVE SHOWS THAT

02:58:11.714 --> 02:58:13.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HYSICIANS ANOTHER. IN SINGLE

02:58:13.649 --> 02:58:15.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PAYER COUNTRIES MAKE LESS MONEY.

02:58:15.785 --> 02:58:17.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE SO HOW

02:58:17.486 --> 02:58:20.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DO YOU ENVISION AND TAKING.

02:58:20.756 --> 02:58:23.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF THE TRANSITION IT TO GET.

02:58:23.926 --> 02:58:26.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FLIP THAT SEVENTY PERCENT TO

02:58:26.162 --> 02:58:27.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIRTY PERCENT. HOW DO WE GET

02:58:27.396 --> 02:58:29.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
THERE?

02:58:29.632 --> 02:58:31.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE WE WON'T

02:58:31.100 --> 02:58:32.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAT WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIMARY

02:58:32.368 --> 02:58:33.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
CARE FORCE RIGHT NOW.

02:58:33.769 --> 02:58:35.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ON THE BEST DAY

02:58:35.504 --> 02:58:36.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I GET CONCERNED IN A ROW I

02:58:36.906 --> 02:58:38.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REPRESENT A VERY RURAL DISTRICT

02:58:38.941 --> 02:58:41.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE CAN'T GET DOCTORS THERE NOW.

02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:43.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WEEK WE STRUGGLE WITH THAT.

02:58:43.846 --> 02:58:45.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE HAVE TO FLY THEY HAVE TO FLY

02:58:45.881 --> 02:58:47.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTORS FOR

02:58:47.917 --> 02:58:50.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE OF MY HOSPITALS IN. IN IN IN

02:58:50.252 --> 02:58:51.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IN ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE

02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:53.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COUNTIES IN IN THE STATE WHERE

02:58:53.556 --> 02:58:54.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE POOREST COUNTIES IN THE

02:58:54.123 --> 02:58:55.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
STATE.

02:58:55.091 --> 02:58:55.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO WHERE DID THE DOCTORS COME

02:58:55.691 --> 02:58:57.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
FROM

02:58:57.159 --> 02:58:58.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

KNOW I SEE DOCTORS ASKING

02:59:00.029 --> 02:59:01.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NODDING THEIR BECAUSE WE'VE HAD

02:59:01.664 --> 02:59:02.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE WE KIND OF HAD SOME OF THIS

02:59:02.631 --> 02:59:04.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
DISCUSSION.

02:59:04.133 --> 02:59:05.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IT THIS IS SAY THIS IS A

02:59:05.067 --> 02:59:07.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MONUMENTAL MONUMENTAL SHIFT IN

02:59:07.236 --> 02:59:08.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE WAY WE PRACTICE PRACTICE

02:59:08.504 --> 02:59:10.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
MEDICINE SO.

02:59:10.372 --> 02:59:11.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT ISN'T AND I KNOW IT'S NOT

02:59:11.974 --> 02:59:13.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAN CONSIDER CONSIDERED AN FIVE

02:59:13.342 --> 02:59:14.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SIX TWO SO MAYBE THIS IS JUST

02:59:14.810 --> 02:59:16.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MORE A COMMENTARY BUT. BUT I

02:59:16.445 --> 02:59:17.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

02:59:17.913 --> 02:59:19.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'RE NOT WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE

ALL DOESN'T WORK FOR ME IN MY

02:59:28.991 --> 02:59:30.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
RURAL COMMUNITIES.

02:59:31.060 --> 02:59:33.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE FIGHT ALL THE TIME FOR THINGS

02:59:33.629 --> 02:59:34.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PURCHASED OUR FAIR SHARE OF

02:59:34.196 --> 02:59:35.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%

02:59:37.366 --> 02:59:39.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKED ABOUT.

CENTER KILLS APPROACH WAS. A

02:59:41.937 --> 02:59:44.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REGIONAL APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE

02:59:44.607 --> 02:59:45.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TO TO BECAUSE THIS IS AN

02:59:45.774 --> 02:59:48.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
EXTREMELY DIVERSE DAY.

02:59:48.677 --> 02:59:50.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXTREMELY DIVERSE STATE SO THIS

02:59:50.646 --> 02:59:53.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONE SIZE ONE WHEN WAY FITS ALL.

02:59:53.449 --> 02:59:54.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK REAL WELL IN

.

02:59:59.822 --> 03:00:01.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE DEFINIR NOT CREATING A ONE

03:00:01.123 --> 03:00:03.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SIZE FITS ALL BUT IMAGINE IF IN

03:00:03.159 --> 03:00:04.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT RURAL AREA THAT MEDI CAL

03:00:04.894 --> 03:00:07.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RATES WENT UP TWENTY PERCENT.

03:00:07.496 --> 03:00:08.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

03:00:08.230 --> 03:00:09.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROPOSING THE MEDIC HOW RATES

03:00:09.999 --> 03:00:11.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING UP TWENTY PERCENT HOW MANY

03:00:11.867 --> 03:00:14.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MORE DOCTORS WOULD TAKE MEDI CAL

03:00:14.136 --> 03:00:14.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WOULDN'T DAD IMPROVE THE

03:00:15.004 --> 03:00:16.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SITUATION I AGREE THE CURRENT

03:00:16.772 --> 03:00:18.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SYSTEM WHERE YOU'VE GOT.

SPECIALIST PAY. THAT HAS CREATED

03:00:24.446 --> 03:00:26.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FEWER PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WE

03:00:26.282 --> 03:00:27.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WORK WITH TO PHYSICIANS FOR

03:00:27.550 --> 03:00:28.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM LIKE THE

03:00:28.651 --> 03:00:31.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAPITATA. THEY SEE THIS TOO AND

03:00:31.187 --> 03:00:32.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY STILL SUPPORT THIS REFORM

03:00:32.855 --> 03:00:34.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AS THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESSING

03:00:34.290 --> 03:00:36.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THESE PROBLEMS EXIST CURRENT

03:00:36.358 --> 03:00:38.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SYSTEM NEW SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM

03:00:38.727 --> 03:00:39.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS BETTER ABLE TO ADDRESS THEM

03:00:39.628 --> 03:00:41.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN OUR VIEW IT IS NOT A ONE SIZE

03:00:41.797 --> 03:00:44.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
FITS ALL BY ANY MEANS.

03:00:44.133 --> 03:00:45.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND IN FACT WE THINK THAT THAT

03:00:45.534 --> 03:00:47.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THE STRUCTURE OF IT ENABLES

03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:48.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THE BOARD TO SET UP.

03:00:48.537 --> 03:00:50.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

THE QUESTIONS FROM DOCTOR WOULD

03:05:18.907 --> 03:05:19.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

AND I AM A CO AUTHOR OF S. B.

03:05:28.016 --> 03:05:30.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FIVE SIXTY TWO I DO THINK.

03:05:30.452 --> 03:05:32.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WE OUGHT TO EXPAND THIS TO

03:05:32.521 --> 03:05:34.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK ABOUT THAT ASPECT OF HOW

03:05:34.156 --> 03:05:37.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE ENSURE REALLY THE FUTURE OF

03:05:37.092 --> 03:05:38.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF WATER WORKFORCE NEEDS DEBATE.

03:05:38.994 --> 03:05:40.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BOMB THERE WERE TWO POINTS THAT

03:05:40.863 --> 03:05:41.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAME UP IN YOUR DISCUSSION WITH

03:05:41.497 --> 03:05:42.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOCTOR WHAT I JUST WANTED TO

03:05:42.898 --> 03:05:44.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CLARIFY A PRUDE SOME DISCUSSION

03:05:44.299 --> 03:05:46.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AROUND THE IDEA THAT.

03:05:46.401 --> 03:05:48.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE'S NOT AN EXPECTATION OF A

03:05:48.337 --> 03:05:50.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HUGE LOSS OF JOBS IN THE

03:05:50.439 --> 03:05:53.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTHCARE SECTOR. ARM AND AND

03:05:53.075 --> 03:05:54.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME BACK

03:05:54.209 --> 03:05:55.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND FORTH ABOUT WHAT JOBS WOULD

03:05:56.044 --> 03:05:56.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LOOK LIKE IN THE INSURANCE

03:05:56.712 --> 03:05:58.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INDUSTRY. BUT JUST ONE CLEAR MY

03:05:59.047 --> 03:06:01.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNDERSTANDING IS YOUR CONTENTION

03:06:01.183 --> 03:06:02.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS THAT JOBS ARE NOT GOING TO GO

03:06:02.251 --> 03:06:03.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOWN THEY MAY GO DOWN IN THE

03:06:03.585 --> 03:06:05.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INSURANCE INDUSTRY. BUT OVERALL

03:06:05.454 --> 03:06:06.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR WITH THE

03:06:06.788 --> 03:06:08.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IDEA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO EXPAND

03:06:08.090 --> 03:06:10.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THE NUMBER

03:06:10.158 --> 03:06:11.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

CARE YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING TO GO

03:06:14.863 --> 03:06:17.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOWN DRAMATICALLY IS THAT IS AT

03:06:17.099 --> 03:06:17.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE POINT THAT I THINK I'LL TRY

03:06:17.766 --> 03:06:19.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO MAKE. WELL I KNOW I DON'T

03:06:19.902 --> 03:06:20.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEAH I DON'T THINK THERE'D BE

03:06:20.502 --> 03:06:22.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
ANY REDUCTION IN.

INVOLVED IN PROVIDING CARE.

03:06:27.709 --> 03:06:29.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING

03:06:29.278 --> 03:06:31.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO GO UP BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL

03:06:31.446 --> 03:06:33.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HAVE MORE ACCESS TO CARE.

03:06:33.248 --> 03:06:34.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%

03:07:38.947 --> 03:07:40.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND SALES TAX BUT YOU DIDN'T

03:07:40.949 --> 03:07:42.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOOK AT WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

03:07:42.784 --> 03:07:44.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DO IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE WERE TO

03:07:44.987 --> 03:07:46.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RAISE TAXES IN THOSE VERY AREAS

03:07:46.822 --> 03:07:48.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHERE THINGS WERE CUT AT THE

03:07:48.156 --> 03:07:49.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
FEDERAL LEVEL.

03:07:49.524 --> 03:07:50.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHICH I THINK WOULD PROBABLY

03:07:50.726 --> 03:07:51.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BRING IN TENS OF BILLIONS OF

03:07:52.060 --> 03:07:52.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DOLLARS THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO

03:07:52.928 --> 03:07:54.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OBVIATE THE NEED EVEN FOR SALES

03:07:54.663 --> 03:07:56.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TAX AS YOU PROPOSED IT IS EVEN

03:07:57.065 --> 03:07:58.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOOKED EVEN LOOKED AT THE IMPACT

03:07:58.800 --> 03:07:59.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
OF TRUMP TAX.

03:07:59.968 --> 03:08:01.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROVISIONS ON WHAT OTHER OPTIONS

03:08:01.837 --> 03:08:03.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE COULD CONSIDER HERE IN THE

03:08:03.071 --> 03:08:04.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SNOW CALIFORNIA I HAVEN'T BUT AS

03:08:04.906 --> 03:08:06.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WE KNOW THAT THE PRIMARY

03:08:06.408 --> 03:08:07.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BENEFICIARY OF THE OF THE.

03:08:08.043 --> 03:08:11.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRUMP TAX CUTS ARE CORPORATIONS.

03:08:11.346 --> 03:08:11.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

03:08:11.947 --> 03:08:14.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:16.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVING THE CORPORATIONS PAY LESS

03:08:16.585 --> 03:08:18.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND FEDERAL TAXES WEALTH AND

03:08:18.320 --> 03:08:19.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEREFORE MAKE IT EASIER FOR

03:08:19.688 --> 03:08:22.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEM TO. INCREASE WHATEVER

03:08:22.257 --> 03:08:23.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OBLIGATIONS THEY WOULD HAVE

03:08:23.925 --> 03:08:26.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
UNDER THIS PROVISION.

03:08:26.128 --> 03:08:27.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT PROFESSOR

03:08:27.129 --> 03:08:28.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'S THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE AS

03:08:28.730 --> 03:08:29.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WELL THAT CORPORATIONS IN

03:08:29.965 --> 03:08:31.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CALIFORNIA THAT I'VE SEEN TENS

03:08:31.466 --> 03:08:32.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CUTS.

03:08:32.934 --> 03:08:34.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IF WE WERE ASSN TO GO BACK TO

03:08:34.403 --> 03:08:35.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHERE THEY WERE ON DECEMBER

03:08:35.437 --> 03:08:37.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIRTY FIRST. THAT WOULD BE MORE

03:08:37.506 --> 03:08:39.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAN ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE WE

03:08:39.574 --> 03:08:40.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY CHARGING

03:08:40.509 --> 03:08:41.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU SALES TAX TO PAY FOR WHAT

TO DECIDE HOW.

03:08:51.887 --> 03:08:53.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WERE RAISES REVENUES TO GIVE

03:08:53.789 --> 03:08:54.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
YOU ALL OPTIONS.

03:08:54.856 --> 03:08:56.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

COMING OUT EVEN.

03:09:30.959 --> 03:09:31.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND IN THIS IS CERTAINLY

03:09:31.993 --> 03:09:33.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONVERSATION INTERESTED AND THEN

03:09:33.395 --> 03:09:34.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITHOUT PUTTING MY COLLEAGUE IS

TWO. SUGGESTING WE NEED TO

PURCHASING AND AND I THINK A

03:09:51.913 --> 03:09:52.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NUMBER OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN

03:09:52.781 --> 03:09:53.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

TO YOUR BILL US.

03:09:56.885 --> 03:09:58.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AB FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN THAT WOULD

03:09:58.987 --> 03:10:01.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REQUIRE THE OVER DOZEN SIT STATE

03:10:01.289 --> 03:10:02.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AGENCIES THAT PURCHASE DRUGS TO

03:10:02.891 --> 03:10:04.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ACTUALLY TALK TO EACH OTHER

03:10:04.359 --> 03:10:05.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT THEY DON'T

03:10:05.560 --> 03:10:07.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SHARE INFORMATION. THEY DON'T

03:10:07.229 --> 03:10:07.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EVEN KNOW WHAT EACH OTHER'S

03:10:07.796 --> 03:10:10.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

BUT IT IS STALLED IN THE FINAL

03:10:15.403 --> 03:10:16.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SENATE COMMITTEE BUT THAT BEING

03:10:16.371 --> 03:10:18.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SAID SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

03:10:18.306 --> 03:10:20.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROPOSAL IS ON YOUR PART. YOU'RE

03:10:20.342 --> 03:10:22.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUGGESTING THAT WE CONSOLIDATE

03:10:22.110 --> 03:10:23.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE BUYING POWER NOT JUST OF

03:10:23.845 --> 03:10:26.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
STATE AGENCIES BUT LOCAL

03:10:27.015 --> 03:10:29.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONSUMER AND PATIENT STATUS AT.

03:10:29.718 --> 03:10:30.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS THAT RIGHT YEAH THAT'S THAT'S

03:10:30.719 --> 03:10:32.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FAIR I MEAN I THINK WHAT I

03:10:32.554 --> 03:10:33.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SUGGEST IN THE STUDY WERE TWO

03:10:33.789 --> 03:10:34.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
MODELS.

03:10:35.023 --> 03:10:36.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ONE A DOMESTIC MODEL THE

03:10:36.558 --> 03:10:39.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION AND TO.

03:10:39.161 --> 03:10:41.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CANADA IN TERMS OF THEIR HAVING

03:10:42.030 --> 03:10:43.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FORMULARIES AND A AND USING

03:10:43.999 --> 03:10:45.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEIR BARGAINING POWER TO LOWER

03:10:45.834 --> 03:10:47.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DRUG PRICES THEY'RE QUITE

03:10:47.302 --> 03:10:49.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SUCCESSFUL IN FACT THE NUMBER

03:10:49.237 --> 03:10:50.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT. WE HAVE IN OUR STUDY OF A

03:10:50.972 --> 03:10:52.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THIRTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN

03:10:52.808 --> 03:10:54.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS IS

03:10:54.309 --> 03:10:55.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
EXTREMELY MODEST.

03:10:55.944 --> 03:10:57.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW WE'RE

03:10:57.846 --> 03:10:59.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOOKING AT OTHER COUNTRIES HERE

03:10:59.414 --> 03:11:01.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FORTY FIFTY PERCENT. THIS

03:11:01.183 --> 03:11:02.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
SPENDING LESS.

03:11:02.551 --> 03:11:04.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THROUGH USING.

03:11:04.186 --> 03:11:06.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEIR BARGAINING POWER SO IT

03:11:07.055 --> 03:11:08.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THAT IS A.

03:11:08.156 --> 03:11:10.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
HUGE AREA FOR SAVINGS

03:11:10.525 --> 03:11:13.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND IT'S AND IT'S PROVEN TO WORK

03:11:13.094 --> 03:11:13.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND EVERY SINGLE SETTING THAT

03:11:13.895 --> 03:11:15.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ITS USE.

03:11:15.197 --> 03:11:17.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO I I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY AND I

03:11:17.666 --> 03:11:19.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M GLAD T HEAR ABOUT THE WORK

03:11:19.134 --> 03:11:20.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU'RE DOING I DON'T KNOW THE

03:11:20.569 --> 03:11:21.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DETAILS OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW

03:11:21.203 --> 03:11:22.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

03:11:22.204 --> 03:11:24.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT CERTAINLY IS A VERY PROMISING

03:11:24.806 --> 03:11:25.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
AREA ENDS WITHIN.

03:11:26.041 --> 03:11:27.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
S. B. FIVE SIXTY TWO THAT WOULD

03:11:27.909 --> 03:11:30.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BE A FUNDAMENTAL BENEFIT THAT

03:11:30.412 --> 03:11:32.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOULD BE GAINED ON BEHALF OF THE

03:11:32.614 --> 03:11:34.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA I WOULD

03:11:34.182 --> 03:11:35.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LOVE IF YOU COULD PROVIDE MY

INFORMATION ON THAT SUBJECT SO

03:11:37.986 --> 03:11:39.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE CAN THINK FURTHER ABOUT IT.

03:11:39.721 --> 03:11:41.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
UP I'D LIKE TO ASK THE THE

03:11:43.391 --> 03:11:44.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SLIDES IN THE PRESENTATION WHICH

03:11:45.026 --> 03:11:46.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALLY JUMPED AT ME AND I HAVE.

03:11:46.695 --> 03:11:47.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM AND

03:11:47.796 --> 03:11:50.432 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
THAT WAS ABOUT THE CONTENTION
OF.

03:11:50.498 --> 03:11:52.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE DENIAL OF OF CARE BY BY

03:11:52.467 --> 03:11:54.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES SO

03:11:54.236 --> 03:11:55.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I'D ACTUALLY NOT SEEN THIS

03:11:55.437 --> 03:11:57.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANALYSIS BEFORE THAT SUGGESTED

03:11:57.239 --> 03:11:58.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT. ARE IN THE TIME FRAME OF

03:11:59.040 --> 03:12:00.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TWO THOUSAND NINE TO TWO

03:12:00.609 --> 03:12:01.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THOUSAND ELEVEN.

03:12:01.409 --> 03:12:04.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
A QUARTER OF ALL CLAIMS.

03:12:04.412 --> 03:12:06.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HAD BEEN REJECTED BY THE

03:12:06.214 --> 03:12:08.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE THE IT

03:12:08.416 --> 03:12:09.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW FIFTEEN MILLION CLAIMS

03:12:09.784 --> 03:12:11.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THIRTEEN MILLION CLAIMS ARE

03:12:11.453 --> 03:12:12.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TALKING ONE OUT OF THREE.

03:12:13.021 --> 03:12:14.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CALIFORNIANS ARE ONE AYE IT'S

03:12:15.056 --> 03:12:16.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AN ENORMOUS NUMBER AND AND AND I

03:12:16.992 --> 03:12:17.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THIS

03:12:17.859 --> 03:12:19.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
INFORMATION IS NO LONGER.

03:12:19.594 --> 03:12:21.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.

03:12:21.463 --> 03:12:23.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:12:23.465 --> 03:12:24.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT WEISS

03:12:24.466 --> 03:12:24.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
INFORMATION UP PUBLICLY

03:12:24.966 --> 03:12:26.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
AVAILABLE.

03:12:26.801 --> 03:12:27.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
WELL.

03:12:27.269 --> 03:12:27.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
OUR VIEW.

03:12:28.036 --> 03:12:29.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS BECAUSE THE

03:12:29.804 --> 03:12:31.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STUDY CAME OUT AND THE INSURANCE

03:12:31.506 --> 03:12:32.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INDUSTRY DIDN'T WANT THE DATA

03:12:32.807 --> 03:12:34.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AVAILABLE ANYMORE SO TO SPEAK

03:12:34.843 --> 03:12:36.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE STATE AGENCY NO LONGER

03:12:36.077 --> 03:12:37.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROVIDES IT THAT'S WHAT OUR

03:12:37.445 --> 03:12:38.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
RESEARCHERS.

03:12:39.014 --> 03:12:40.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CAME UP WITH WHEN THEY

03:12:40.181 --> 03:12:41.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INVESTIGATED IT AND SO THAT'S

03:12:41.816 --> 03:12:42.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHY WE USE THE INDEPENDENT

03:12:42.951 --> 03:12:43.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MEDICAL REVIEW IS KIND OF A

03:12:43.718 --> 03:12:45.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
PROXY.

03:12:45.754 --> 03:12:46.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT THAT THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED

03:12:46.988 --> 03:12:48.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE THE INDUSTRY SHUT IT DOWN.

03:12:48.223 --> 03:12:50.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

03:12:50.191 --> 03:12:52.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
IT'S NOT STATE LAW.

03:12:52.127 --> 03:12:53.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WE. GET THIS INFORMATION IS

03:12:53.795 --> 03:12:55.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
NOT STATE LAW THAT THIS

03:12:55.664 --> 03:12:56.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
INFORMATION BE PUBLICLY

03:12:56.398 --> 03:12:58.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AVAILABLE. IF WE COULD GO TO THE

03:12:58.233 --> 03:13:00.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEXT SLIDE IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

03:13:00.669 --> 03:13:03.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO SO IF I READ THIS CORRECTLY

03:13:03.638 --> 03:13:05.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT

03:13:05.540 --> 03:13:07.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MILLIONS OF CLAIMS WERE. WERE

03:13:07.142 --> 03:13:09.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DENIED AND OF THAT ONLY FORTY

03:13:09.611 --> 03:13:10.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PERCENT WERE APPEALED SO IN

03:13:10.645 --> 03:13:12.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OTHER WORDS EITHER. THAT YOU

03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:13.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KNOW OF ANY OTHER SIXTY PERCENT

03:13:13.815 --> 03:13:14.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND A PERCENTAGE WAS REVERSED

03:13:15.016 --> 03:13:16.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE DECISION BY THE PLANES

03:13:16.318 --> 03:13:18.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REVERSED OR. NOT THE PILLS WERE

03:13:18.753 --> 03:13:19.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RETURNED AND MY GETTING THAT

03:13:19.354 --> 03:13:21.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RIGHT YOU'RE CORRECT AND KEEP IN

03:13:21.122 --> 03:13:23.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MIND THAT EVERY BEFORE YOU GET

03:13:23.725 --> 03:13:25.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INTO HIM IN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL

03:13:25.427 --> 03:13:26.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REVIEW YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH

03:13:27.062 --> 03:13:27.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THE COMPANIES AND.

03:13:27.829 --> 03:13:29.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.

03:13:29.631 --> 03:13:31.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT IS A THIRTY DAY MINIMUM

03:13:31.166 --> 03:13:32.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROCEDURE CONTROLLED BY THE

03:13:32.734 --> 03:13:34.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
COMPANY.

03:13:34.469 --> 03:13:36.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MOST OF THE MONETARY AWARDS AT

03:13:36.638 --> 03:13:38.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE END OF THIS PROCESS THAT ARE

03:13:38.840 --> 03:13:40.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GIVEN ARE BECAUSE OF HOW THE

03:13:40.842 --> 03:13:42.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE HAS FAILED

03:13:43.011 --> 03:13:44.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PATIENTS SO THIS IS THE SECOND

03:13:44.245 --> 03:13:45.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
STEP.

03:13:45.714 --> 03:13:46.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FIRST WE GOT TO GET TO THE

03:13:46.481 --> 03:13:48.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE WHICH IS WHY

03:13:48.483 --> 03:13:49.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE SAY IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG

03:13:49.718 --> 03:13:51.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS GO THROUGH THAT GAUNTLET.

03:13:51.252 --> 03:13:52.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STILL GO TO INDEPENDENT MEDICAL

03:13:52.687 --> 03:13:55.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REVIEW AND STILL SIXTY PERCENT.

03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:57.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARE OVERTURNED ESSENTIALLY.

03:13:57.792 --> 03:13:59.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IN THE NEXT SLIDE THIS IS

03:13:59.494 --> 03:14:01.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OBVIOUSLY PAYMENT TONIGHT FOR

03:14:01.162 --> 03:14:03.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MERCY URGENT CARE. AND THEN IF

03:14:03.098 --> 03:14:03.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU COULD JUST FLIP THROUGH THE

03:14:04.032 --> 03:14:05.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NEXT FEW SLIDES I KNOW THIS THIS

03:14:06.001 --> 03:14:07.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
IS ABOUT INDUSTRY.

03:14:07.736 --> 03:14:08.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
PROFITS AND.

03:14:08.803 --> 03:14:10.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND WHAT'S NOT HAPPENING AND

03:14:10.839 --> 03:14:11.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEN TO THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG

03:14:11.873 --> 03:14:13.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
POINT WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS

03:14:13.408 --> 03:14:15.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
MOMENT.

03:14:15.443 --> 03:14:17.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT DENIALS OR WHAT WHAT WHAT

03:14:17.479 --> 03:14:19.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE THAT

03:14:19.414 --> 03:14:20.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHEN THEY'RE DENIED UP A PATIENT

03:14:20.315 --> 03:14:22.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
DECIDES NOT

03:14:22.083 --> 03:14:23.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
APPEAL CARESSED DON'T KNOW THAT

03:14:23.685 --> 03:14:24.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S WHAT WE DON'T KNOW GIVING

03:14:24.319 --> 03:14:25.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
ESTIMATE?

03:14:25.286 --> 03:14:27.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UP YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE DON'T

03:14:27.422 --> 03:14:27.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
ACTUALLY.

03:14:27.989 --> 03:14:30.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE AN ESTIMATE OKAY SO THE

03:14:30.325 --> 03:14:31.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINT I'M ACTUALLY WANT TO MAKE

03:14:31.459 --> 03:14:34.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HERE IS I'D LIKE TO ASK THE

03:14:34.095 --> 03:14:35.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INSURANCE INDUSTRY IF YOU COULD

03:14:35.130 --> 03:14:37.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESPOND TO THESE LAST FEW SLIDES

03:14:38.066 --> 03:14:38.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL I THINK FOR

03:14:38.700 --> 03:14:39.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
US TO KNOW.

03:14:39.567 --> 03:14:41.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ABOUT THIS DATA AND WHETHER

03:14:41.603 --> 03:14:42.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THIS I'M ASSUMING THIS

03:14:42.804 --> 03:14:43.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
INFORMATION IS TRUE.

03:14:43.772 --> 03:14:46.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I'D I WOULD LOVE TO TO GET

03:14:46.441 --> 03:14:47.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOME VERIFICATION ON THAT THAT

03:14:47.742 --> 03:14:48.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
WE CAN PROVIDE.

03:14:48.643 --> 03:14:50.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE RESEARCHERS WHO DID THIS

03:14:50.311 --> 03:14:51.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
PROJECT WE CAN PROVIDE

03:14:51.679 --> 03:14:53.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADDITIONAL A MATERIAL THIS IS A

03:14:53.515 --> 03:14:55.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SUMMARY OF THEIR WORK WERE HAPPY

03:14:55.183 --> 03:14:56.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND

03:14:56.484 --> 03:14:57.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

03:14:57.886 --> 03:14:59.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ON THIS OKAY.

03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:00.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME AND THEN RELATED TO THIS I

03:15:00.288 --> 03:15:01.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW I'VE HEARD AT LEAST EVERY

03:15:02.023 --> 03:15:03.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DEMOCRAT ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE

03:15:03.491 --> 03:15:05.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR A

03:15:05.160 --> 03:15:06.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE BECAUSE I

03:15:06.728 --> 03:15:08.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AB I JUST HADN'T HEARD THIS.

03:15:08.296 --> 03:15:09.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHETHER THIS IS SOMETHING A

03:15:09.764 --> 03:15:10.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STATEMENT YOU WOULD BELIEVE IN

03:15:10.532 --> 03:15:12.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT I THINK EVERY DEMOCRAT ON

03:15:12.100 --> 03:15:13.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIS COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT

03:15:13.234 --> 03:15:14.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT.

03:15:14.569 --> 03:15:16.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN SHOULD

03:15:16.671 --> 03:15:18.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE AN AXE ACCESS TO HEALTH

03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:20.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CARE I'M AND THAT HEALTHCARE

03:15:20.542 --> 03:15:21.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SHOULD JUST GO TO THOSE WHO CAN

03:15:21.643 --> 03:15:22.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PAY OR THOSE WHO CAN PAY A LOT

03:15:22.644 --> 03:15:24.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
OF THOSE WHO.

03:15:24.412 --> 03:15:24.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DON'T GET A CERTAIN TYPE OF

03:15:24.979 --> 03:15:26.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ILLNESS.

03:15:26.448 --> 03:15:27.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IF THAT'S

03:15:27.849 --> 03:15:29.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE CASE WHEN WE HAVE STATUS QUO

03:15:29.451 --> 03:15:30.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR MILLIONS

03:15:30.819 --> 03:15:33.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF DENIALS. IT SEEMS TO CUT UP

03:15:33.288 --> 03:15:34.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%

CLOSE WITH THE FOLLOWING A.

03:20:39.761 --> 03:20:40.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'VE BEEN A LONG TIME SUPPORTER

03:20:40.928 --> 03:20:42.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE ACA AND I AND WE ALL KNOW

03:20:42.864 --> 03:20:44.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES

03:20:44.932 --> 03:20:46.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE TRYING TO RIP APART THE ACA.

03:20:47.001 --> 03:20:48.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT I ALSO THINK THE ACA HAS NOT

03:20:48.569 --> 03:20:49.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
BEEN.

03:20:49.203 --> 03:20:51.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT WE WANTED IT TO BE AND AS

03:20:51.806 --> 03:20:53.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS YOU'VE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING

03:20:53.074 --> 03:20:54.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE LAST FEW MINUTES AROUND OUR

03:20:54.475 --> 03:20:56.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNDER INSURANCE RATES AS WELL AS

03:20:56.511 --> 03:20:57.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE FACT THAT WE STILL HAVE

03:20:57.745 --> 03:20:59.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MILLIONS WHO ARE UNINSURED? AND

03:20:59.814 --> 03:21:01.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND SO THIS IS IN PART WHY I

03:21:01.983 --> 03:21:02.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER OF THE

03:21:02.950 --> 03:21:04.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
VISION OF SINGLE PAYER.

03:21:04.919 --> 03:21:07.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

03:21:09.690 --> 03:21:11.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HYPOTHESIS AND AND. I I REALLY

03:21:11.826 --> 03:21:13.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS FOR

03:21:13.361 --> 03:21:14.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MANY HEARINGS OF IN DEPTH

03:21:14.729 --> 03:21:16.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

WHAT WE ARE TO DO WITH AND FOR

03:21:19.300 --> 03:21:21.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT I WILL SAY FUNDAMENTALLY MY

03:21:21.335 --> 03:21:22.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

SAME WE NEED SIGNIFICANT REFORM?

03:21:25.339 --> 03:21:27.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I AND I THINK THE VISION A

03:21:27.308 --> 03:21:28.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SINGLE PAYER STILL MAKE SENSE

03:21:29.043 --> 03:21:31.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT BEING SAID CLEARLY WE HAVE

03:21:31.479 --> 03:21:32.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AN AWFUL LOT OF DETAILS THAT WE

OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DO

03:21:42.857 --> 03:21:44.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GIVEN THE REALITY OF DONALD

03:21:46.093 --> 03:21:48.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOW DO WE SET UP THE ROADMAP?

03:21:48.763 --> 03:21:50.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

03:23:55.489 --> 03:23:57.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FAIR TO SAY THAT OUR STUDY DOES?

03:23:57.358 --> 03:23:59.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAREFULLY DOCUMENT SO IT'S IT'S

03:23:59.560 --> 03:24:00.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HARD FOR ME TO KNOW IN FULL.

03:24:01.062 --> 03:24:03.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IN GENERAL THE FACT IS THAT

03:24:03.631 --> 03:24:05.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEY ARE NOT INCORPORATING

03:24:05.232 --> 03:24:07.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS.

03:24:07.768 --> 03:24:10.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHEREAS WE ARE SO WE WE AGREE.

03:24:10.438 --> 03:24:12.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
TO COVER EVERYBODY.

03:24:12.807 --> 03:24:14.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM.

03:24:14.508 --> 03:24:17.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD COST FOUR HUNDRED BILLION

03:24:17.144 --> 03:24:19.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOLLARS WE'RE IN TOTAL AGREEMENT

03:24:19.447 --> 03:24:20.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

03:24:20.815 --> 03:24:22.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
OFFICE ON THAT.

03:24:22.383 --> 03:24:24.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT WE'RE SAYING THAT WE CAN

03:24:24.752 --> 03:24:26.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GET COSTS DOWN FROM FOUR HUNDRED

03:24:26.520 --> 03:24:28.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BILLION TO THREE THIRTY BILLION

03:24:28.956 --> 03:24:30.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THROUGH THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF

03:24:30.324 --> 03:24:32.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SAVINGS THAT WE DISCUSSED.

03:24:32.226 --> 03:24:34.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THEY DON'T A ENGAGE

03:24:34.929 --> 03:24:36.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ON THAT QUESTION NOT VERY

03:24:36.197 --> 03:24:38.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BRIEFLY I MEAN THEY DO HAVE A

03:24:38.099 --> 03:24:39.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BRIEF DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE

03:24:39.734 --> 03:24:41.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING FOR EXAMPLE

03:24:41.335 --> 03:24:43.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DRUG FORMULARIES BUT THEY SEEM

03:24:43.304 --> 03:24:44.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO SUGGEST THAT THAT'S NOT

03:24:44.205 --> 03:24:45.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
POSSIBLE.

03:24:45.473 --> 03:24:48.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNDER H. P. FIVE SIX TWO WHEREAS

03:24:48.209 --> 03:24:50.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN MY OPINION IT'S A EXTREMELY

03:24:50.778 --> 03:24:51.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
VIABLE.

03:24:51.612 --> 03:24:53.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE

03:24:53.381 --> 03:24:55.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EXAMPLE THEY DO NOT ENGAGE ON

03:24:55.249 --> 03:24:56.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE ISSUE OF ADMINISTRATIVE

03:24:56.317 --> 03:24:57.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SAVINGS.

03:24:57.918 --> 03:25:00.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I AM SO I I WOULD LIKE IT IF

03:25:00.154 --> 03:25:02.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY HAD DOCUMENTED MORE FULLY

03:25:02.156 --> 03:25:04.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHY THEY DON'T THINK YOU CAN GO

03:25:04.358 --> 03:25:06.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DOWN FROM FOUR HUNDRED TO SAY

03:25:06.127 --> 03:25:07.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THREE THIRTY OR THEREABOUTS.

03:25:07.995 --> 03:25:09.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THAT'S WHAT MY.

03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:12.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MY SENSE OF IT OUT A BUT AS I

03:25:12.333 --> 03:25:15.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SAID WE WE DO GO THROUGH IT AND

03:25:15.403 --> 03:25:16.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I APPRECIATE YOU ALL READING

03:25:17.004 --> 03:25:19.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ANYBODY

03:25:19.106 --> 03:25:20.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTUALLY WOULD READ OF ACTUAL

03:25:20.441 --> 03:25:20.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THINGS. BUT.

03:25:20.741 --> 03:25:22.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:25:22.343 --> 03:25:23.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YEAH I'M HERE OF MY STUDENTS

03:25:23.878 --> 03:25:24.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEVER READ WHAT I TELL HUNDRED

03:25:25.012 --> 03:25:25.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

03:25:25.179 --> 03:25:26.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:25:26.681 --> 03:25:29.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE I YOU CAN SEE VERY CLEARLY

03:25:29.383 --> 03:25:30.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOW WE GET FROM FOUR HUNDRED TO

03:25:30.851 --> 03:25:32.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THREE THIRTY IT'S RIGHT THERE

03:25:32.386 --> 03:25:34.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AND I WOULD WELCOME.

03:25:34.088 --> 03:25:35.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MY FORMER STUDENT ROBERT

03:25:35.823 --> 03:25:37.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ENGINEERED A FEAR HERE ARE

03:25:37.591 --> 03:25:40.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LISTENING. TELL ME WHERE I WENT

03:25:40.428 --> 03:25:41.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WRONG IF SOMEBODY HAS A GOOD

03:25:41.862 --> 03:25:43.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CRITICISM I'M OPEN TO IT.

03:25:43.564 --> 03:25:45.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I I THINK IT'S I THINK THEY'RE

03:25:45.399 --> 03:25:47.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE OF ITS IT

03:25:47.168 --> 03:25:48.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
CAN FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE
ESTIMATE.

03:25:48.803 --> 03:25:52.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO I'M WILLING TO STAND BY.

03:25:52.106 --> 03:25:53.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DON'T FOLLOW UP THE CORE.

03:25:53.574 --> 03:25:55.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
REALLY.

03:25:55.443 --> 03:25:56.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU DON'T MUCH LIKE WE WERE

03:25:56.444 --> 03:25:57.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
DISCUSSING EARLIER

03:25:58.012 --> 03:25:58.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE THOSE SAVINGS ACHIEVABLE DAY

03:25:58.946 --> 03:26:00.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ONE.

03:26:00.581 --> 03:26:02.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE THOSE SAVINGS THAT WOULD YOU

03:26:02.483 --> 03:26:04.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
KNOW CHANGE OVER TIME.

03:26:04.185 --> 03:26:05.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND REALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO

03:26:05.453 --> 03:26:07.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
GET AT IS.

03:26:07.121 --> 03:26:09.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOW WE WOULD LOOK AT TRANSITIONS

03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:12.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OR IMPLEMENTATION YET NOT AND

03:26:12.093 --> 03:26:14.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT NOTHING HAPPENS AND DAY ONE

03:26:14.328 --> 03:26:16.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE S. AS EVERYONE IS THAT WE DO

03:26:16.363 --> 03:26:17.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
NOT FLIP SWITCH?

03:26:17.565 --> 03:26:18.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND ALL THE SUDDEN WE GOT THIS

03:26:18.699 --> 03:26:20.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WONDERFUL SYSTEM THAT WORKS

03:26:20.301 --> 03:26:22.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERFECTLY NO THERE HAVE TO BE. A

03:26:22.136 --> 03:26:24.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
A TRANSITION PERIOD

03:26:24.138 --> 03:26:25.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I ON THE OTHER HAND SO. IN THIS

03:26:25.973 --> 03:26:27.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE ON THIS

03:26:27.541 --> 03:26:29.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ISSUE AROUND THE THE COST

03:26:29.844 --> 03:26:30.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
SAVINGS FROM.

03:26:30.644 --> 03:26:31.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
IMPROVE.

03:26:31.378 --> 03:26:33.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
SERVICE PROVISION.

03:26:33.547 --> 03:26:35.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT I'M

03:26:35.416 --> 03:26:37.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ASSUMING FIVE PERCENT SAVINGS IN

03:26:37.818 --> 03:26:39.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT AREA WHERE AS THE INSTITUTE

03:26:39.653 --> 03:26:41.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF MEDICINE SAID IT'S SHOULD BE

03:26:41.956 --> 03:26:43.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NINETEEN PERCENT. SO WHAT I

03:26:43.758 --> 03:26:45.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ACTUALLY THINK IS THAT.

03:26:46.460 --> 03:26:48.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE START IN THE RANGE OF THREE

03:26:48.863 --> 03:26:50.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOUR FIVE PERCENT IN YEAR ONE

03:26:50.631 --> 03:26:52.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE FROM

03:26:52.299 --> 03:26:53.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WHAT MY READING OF THE

03:26:53.100 --> 03:26:55.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LITERATURE. BUT I THINK WE CAN

03:26:55.202 --> 03:26:56.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT IF THERE ISN'T REALLY TWENTY

03:26:56.537 --> 03:26:59.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT OR MORE WASTE OUT THERE.

03:26:59.206 --> 03:27:01.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OVER THE COURSE OF A DECADE OR

03:27:01.408 --> 03:27:03.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ROUGHLY A DECADE WE CAN GET

03:27:03.377 --> 03:27:05.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CLOSER TO TWENTY PERCENT AND

03:27:05.913 --> 03:27:07.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I

03:27:07.715 --> 03:27:09.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THINK THAT THE. A CM ES

03:27:09.250 --> 03:27:10.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
PROJECTIONS.

03:27:10.651 --> 03:27:12.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS YOU

03:27:12.987 --> 03:27:14.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KNOW THE CURVE CONTINUALLY TO GO

03:27:14.922 --> 03:27:16.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UP. I THINK THAT IS THE MAJOR

03:27:17.024 --> 03:27:18.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WAY THROUGH WHICH WE CAN

03:27:18.359 --> 03:27:19.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACTUALLY GET THE CURVE TO GO

03:27:19.493 --> 03:27:21.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOWN RECOGNIZING. THAT THERE IS

03:27:21.796 --> 03:27:23.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE TREMENDOUS WASTE IN THE

03:27:23.330 --> 03:27:25.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEM WE WILL NOT GET AT IT ALL

03:27:25.633 --> 03:27:27.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN YEAR ONE MAYBE WE CAN GET TO

03:27:27.601 --> 03:27:29.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIVE PERCENT IN YEAR ONE OR TWO.

03:27:29.570 --> 03:27:31.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT OVER THE COURSE OF A DECADE

03:27:31.338 --> 03:27:33.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THROUGH A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT

03:27:33.107 --> 03:27:33.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
SYSTEM AND.

03:27:34.041 --> 03:27:37.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MUCH MORE CAREFUL MONITORING WE

03:27:37.278 --> 03:27:38.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MORE

03:27:38.579 --> 03:27:40.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SAVINGS SO THAT'S WHY I THINK.

03:27:40.447 --> 03:27:41.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MY ESTIMATE OF THE EIGHTEEN

03:27:41.682 --> 03:27:43.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PERCENT.

03:27:43.250 --> 03:27:44.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SAVINGS IS PROBABLY PRETTY

03:27:44.718 --> 03:27:47.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
CONSERVATIVE.

03:27:47.454 --> 03:27:48.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT THAT IF I CAN I JUST WANT

03:27:48.956 --> 03:27:49.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

ENDURANCE?

03:27:51.759 --> 03:27:54.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ABILITY TO ANSWER THESE.

03:27:54.895 --> 03:27:56.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK

MADE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE

04:20:15.032 --> 04:20:16.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACT AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF

04:20:16.567 --> 04:20:17.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE WORK THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS

04:20:17.802 --> 04:20:18.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DONE NOT JUST TO IMPLEMENT THE

04:20:18.869 --> 04:20:20.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO IMPROVE UPON THE AFFORDABLE

CARE ACT. AS A RESULT OF THAT

04:20:23.674 --> 04:20:24.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WORK TO IMPLEMENT IMPROVE.

04:20:24.875 --> 04:20:26.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE

NEW CONSUMER PROTECTIONS NEW

04:20:27.979 --> 04:20:29.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OF WITH

04:20:29.780 --> 04:20:30.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REGARD TO GETTING THE CARE THAT

THEY NEED FOR MILLION

04:20:31.983 --> 04:20:33.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CALIFORNIANS HAVE NEW COVERAGE

04:20:33.451 --> 04:20:34.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AS A RESULT OF THAT AND WE'VE

04:20:34.986 --> 04:20:36.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SEEN THE BIGGEST DROP OF THE

04:20:36.420 --> 04:20:37.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNINSURED WRITTEN RATE OF ALL

04:20:37.488 --> 04:20:39.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
FIFTY STATES.

04:20:39.323 --> 04:20:40.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE I WAS

04:20:40.491 --> 04:20:42.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE WERE AT AS MUCH AS TWENTY

04:20:42.393 --> 04:20:44.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT UNINSURED ARE JUST A FEW

04:20:44.395 --> 04:20:47.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YEARS AGO NOW THE CDC HAS THIS

04:20:47.598 --> 04:20:48.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS BACK BELOW SEVEN PERCENT.

04:20:48.199 --> 04:20:49.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

04:20:49.667 --> 04:20:51.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'D IT WE'VE DONE THAT BECAUSE

04:20:51.268 --> 04:20:53.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE'VE TAKEN PROACTIVE ACTIONS

04:20:53.104 --> 04:20:54.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I'M NOT JUST TO BE SATISFIED

04:20:54.672 --> 04:20:56.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH THE FEDERAL LAW BUT TO GO

04:20:56.474 --> 04:20:58.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FORWARD TO HAVE A. OF FOR

04:20:58.209 --> 04:20:59.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EXAMPLE ANY AN EXCHANGE THAT

04:20:59.810 --> 04:21:00.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NEGOTIATE FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE

04:21:00.911 --> 04:21:02.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
PRICE.

04:21:02.446 --> 04:21:04.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A STANDARDIZED OF A BENEFITS TO

04:21:04.682 --> 04:21:06.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROVIDE WAYS TO GET PEOPLE

04:21:06.617 --> 04:21:08.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
QUICKLY AND EASILY INTO COVERAGE

04:21:08.486 --> 04:21:10.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO EXPAND COVERAGE TO NEW OF

04:21:10.321 --> 04:21:11.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
POPULATIONS AS WELL.

04:21:11.989 --> 04:21:14.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SO THE QUESTION I THINK THAT

04:21:14.091 --> 04:21:15.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIS COMMITTEE IS GOOD GRAPPLING

04:21:15.259 --> 04:21:17.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH IS IF WE CAN PREVENT THE

04:21:17.294 --> 04:21:18.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ATTACKS ON OUR HEALTH CARE

04:21:18.662 --> 04:21:19.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY GO FORWARD.

04:21:27.004 --> 04:21:28.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THOUGH I'D JUST ON A MOMENT

04:21:28.406 --> 04:21:30.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABOUT THOSE ATTACKS THAT YOU

04:21:30.107 --> 04:21:31.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

04:25:51.468 --> 04:25:53.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WE DO NOT HAVE SUB STANDARD

04:25:53.137 --> 04:25:54.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COVERAGE THAT LEADS PEOPLE IN

04:25:54.438 --> 04:25:55.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE LURCH WHEN THEY DO WITH IT

04:25:55.372 --> 04:25:56.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHEN THEY DO SIGN UP FOR IT BUT

04:25:56.840 --> 04:25:58.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALSO DESTABILIZES THE OVERALL.

04:25:58.909 --> 04:26:00.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SYSTEM.

04:26:00.611 --> 04:26:01.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT TO THE

04:26:01.211 --> 04:26:02.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXTENT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

04:26:02.146 --> 04:26:03.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IS TRYING TO LOWER THE MEDICAL

04:26:03.480 --> 04:26:05.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOSS RATIO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

04:26:05.916 --> 04:26:07.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT. INSURERS HAVE TO HAVE TO

04:26:07.618 --> 04:26:09.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROVIDE TO PATIENT CARE RATHER

04:26:09.920 --> 04:26:11.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAN TO ADMINISTRATION PROFITS

04:26:11.522 --> 04:26:12.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY WANT TO LOWER THAT AND.

04:26:13.023 --> 04:26:15.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ANNOUNCED THROUGH REGULATION.

04:26:16.026 --> 04:26:16.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BUT IT WILL WE BELIEVE IN

04:26:17.061 --> 04:26:18.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CALIFORNIA SHOULD LOOK AT THAT

04:26:18.462 --> 04:26:19.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE CLOSELY IT ACTUALLY RAISING

04:26:19.930 --> 04:26:21.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT I'M NOT MAKING SURE THAT

04:26:21.165 --> 04:26:22.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'RE GETTING MORE. DOLLARS THAT

04:26:22.966 --> 04:26:24.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GO TO PATIENT CARE RATHER THAN.

04:26:24.568 --> 04:26:25.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DOES OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE

04:26:25.803 --> 04:26:26.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
EXPENSES.

04:26:27.037 --> 04:26:27.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND WITH REGARD TO BROADER

04:26:27.771 --> 04:26:29.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MARKET STABILIZATION WE DO

04:26:29.506 --> 04:26:31.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BELIEVE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF

04:26:31.342 --> 04:26:32.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WE DO NEED

04:26:32.743 --> 04:26:34.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT OTHER EFFORTS TO TRY TO

04:26:34.078 --> 04:26:35.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
STABILIZE OUR MARKET.

04:26:35.446 --> 04:26:37.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ESPECIALLY WE THINK THAT

04:26:37.147 --> 04:26:38.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ACTUALLY LEADS TO SUBSIDIES

04:26:38.682 --> 04:26:39.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RATHER THAN THE PENALTY THAT ARE

04:26:39.883 --> 04:26:41.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE MAIN DRIVER OF ENROLLMENT

04:26:41.452 --> 04:26:43.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO WELL. AND AT PACKAGE ON

04:26:43.287 --> 04:26:45.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GREATER AFFORDABILITY WOULD

04:26:45.389 --> 04:26:46.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD HELP IN THAT REGARD TO

04:26:46.857 --> 04:26:48.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE

04:26:48.192 --> 04:26:50.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO BE COVERED. ARM IF THAT WAS

04:26:50.527 --> 04:26:52.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PARTIALLY FUNDED BY A PART A

04:26:53.063 --> 04:26:54.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MORE PROGRESSIVE AYE INDIVIDUAL

04:26:54.698 --> 04:26:56.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CONTRIBUTION THAT WOULD BE

04:26:56.233 --> 04:26:57.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
APPROPRIATE TO ENCOURAGE

04:26:57.634 --> 04:26:59.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ENROLLMENT SO THAT. AGAIN WE

04:26:59.403 --> 04:27:00.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DON'T HAVE THE ISSUE OF INCREASE

04:27:00.838 --> 04:27:02.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PREMIUMS BY IF SPIKES AND MORE

04:27:02.806 --> 04:27:04.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PEOPLE ON IT UNINSURED THE CBO

04:27:04.942 --> 04:27:06.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
SUGGESTED THAT.

04:27:06.977 --> 04:27:09.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PREMIUMS I'LL WILL GO UP TEN

04:27:09.313 --> 04:27:10.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERCENT AS A RESULT OF SOME OF

04:27:10.748 --> 04:27:11.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE TRUMP SABOTAGE THAT WE'VE

04:27:12.015 --> 04:27:14.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BEEN SEEING AND A ONE POINT

04:27:14.218 --> 04:27:16.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SEVEN MILLION A CALIFORNIANS

04:27:16.620 --> 04:27:17.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD LOSE COVERAGE THAT'S A UC

04:27:17.855 --> 04:27:19.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BERKELEY FIGURE BASED ON CBO

04:27:19.990 --> 04:27:21.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NUMBER. OF THAT WE WANT TO

04:27:21.859 --> 04:27:23.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING SO

04:27:23.460 --> 04:27:24.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WE DON'T HAVE ANY THE

04:27:24.094 --> 04:27:26.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BACKSLIDING. AND OF COURSE WE

04:27:27.064 --> 04:27:30.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NEED AT ONGOING IN OUR VIGILANCE

04:27:30.868 --> 04:27:31.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
WITH REGARD TO THIS.

04:27:31.602 --> 04:27:32.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT THAT'S ABOUT JUST STAYING IN

04:27:32.302 --> 04:27:32.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE SAME PLACE AND THAT'S NOT

04:27:32.903 --> 04:27:36.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
WHAT CALIFORNIA WANTS TO DO
PORTANTINO DITION OF TRYING TO

04:27:37.040 --> 04:27:38.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MOVE FORWARD WITH HEALTH REFORMS

04:27:38.876 --> 04:27:40.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THE P. IT

04:27:40.744 --> 04:27:42.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO

04:27:42.646 --> 04:27:43.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE CARE THAT THEY NEED.

04:27:43.814 --> 04:27:45.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I YOU KNOW THIS IS A BIPARTISAN

04:27:45.849 --> 04:27:46.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TRADITION DATING BACK TO

04:27:47.050 --> 04:27:48.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
GOVERNOR EARL WARREN.

04:27:48.452 --> 04:27:50.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INTO SOME OF THE I WE HAVE

04:27:50.587 --> 04:27:53.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRADITIONALLY OVER MANY YEARS ON

04:27:53.390 --> 04:27:54.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT CERTAINLY AND THE THIRTY

04:27:54.324 --> 04:27:55.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YEARS OF MY ORGANIZATION THE

04:27:55.526 --> 04:27:56.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEVENTEEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN

04:27:56.894 --> 04:27:58.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
IN THIS POSITION DOING THIS
WORK.

04:27:58.695 --> 04:28:00.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN A RANGE

04:28:00.297 --> 04:28:01.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF DIFFERENT PROPOSALS WORK

04:28:01.732 --> 04:28:03.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TOGETHER AND I DO BELIEVE THAT

04:28:03.700 --> 04:28:05.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALL OF THESE EFFORTS CAN GET CAN

04:28:05.135 --> 04:28:07.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SHOULD BE COMPLEMENTARY TO

04:28:07.704 --> 04:28:09.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO GET TO THIS GOAL WERE ALL OF.

04:28:09.339 --> 04:28:11.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE QUESTION IS ON SOME OF THESE

04:28:11.608 --> 04:28:13.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE THE PROPOSALS HAVE ALWAYS

04:28:13.577 --> 04:28:14.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BEEN ON DIFFERENT TRACKS AND

04:28:14.945 --> 04:28:16.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DIFFERENT TIME TABLES AND I

04:28:16.213 --> 04:28:18.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK THAT. OF WE ARE LOOKING AT

04:28:18.382 --> 04:28:19.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ONE OF THOSE.

04:28:19.416 --> 04:28:23.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TIMES AGAIN AND SO I WANT TO

04:28:23.086 --> 04:28:24.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.

04:28:24.888 --> 04:28:25.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE THROUGH

04:28:25.956 --> 04:28:27.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE GOAL THAT MY ORGANIZATION

04:28:27.624 --> 04:28:28.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAS SUPPORTED SINCE ITS FOUNDING

04:28:28.625 --> 04:28:29.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF OF A UNIVERSAL SINGLE PAYER

04:28:29.593 --> 04:28:30.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MEDICARE FOR ALL SYSTEM IS

04:28:30.828 --> 04:28:33.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMETHING THAT WE WE STRONGLY.

04:28:33.664 --> 04:28:35.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADVOCATE WITH FULL THROATED LEE

04:28:35.199 --> 04:28:37.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IT IS A. OF WHAT WE BELIEVE

04:28:37.367 --> 04:28:39.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WELL

04:28:39.136 --> 04:28:41.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DESIGNED YEAH THIS IS NOT AN

04:28:41.271 --> 04:28:42.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IDEOLOGICAL ISSUE THIS IS ABOUT

04:28:42.973 --> 04:28:44.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOW DO WE GET TO THESE GOALS OF.

04:28:44.741 --> 04:28:45.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A WELL DESIGNED SYSTEM IS A WAY

04:28:46.009 --> 04:28:47.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO GET TO THE GOT TO GO OF

04:28:47.845 --> 04:28:49.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
UNIVERSALITY OF HAVING A

04:28:49.379 --> 04:28:51.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROGRESS A PUBLIC PUBLICLY IN

04:28:51.181 --> 04:28:52.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
PROGRESSIVELY FINANCED

04:28:52.216 --> 04:28:54.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM A SYSTEM THAT

04:28:54.384 --> 04:28:55.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE.

04:28:56.019 --> 04:28:57.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I SYSTEM THE ODD THAT HAS

04:28:57.354 --> 04:28:58.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE THAT IS

04:28:58.489 --> 04:29:00.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIMPLER AND MORE EFFICIENT AND

04:29:00.390 --> 04:29:01.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ON THAT IS FOCUSED ON PREVENTION

04:29:01.758 --> 04:29:03.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IS RATHER THAN PROFITS.

04:29:03.427 --> 04:29:05.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
IT IS YEAH.

04:29:05.596 --> 04:29:08.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DID. WE DO IT THIS IS A SYSTEM

04:29:08.198 --> 04:29:10.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT ARE THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE

04:29:10.501 --> 04:29:12.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
TO TRY TO WORK TO.

04:29:12.436 --> 04:29:14.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE RECOGNIZE HOWEVER THAT THIS.

04:29:15.038 --> 04:29:17.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SYSTEM HE AYE DOES HAVE ITS

04:29:17.741 --> 04:29:19.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OBSTACLES AS AS DO MOST HEALTH

04:29:19.943 --> 04:29:22.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ROOM CARE REFORMS AYE. AYE THAT

04:29:22.145 --> 04:29:23.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF OBSTACLES

04:29:23.647 --> 04:29:25.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO ANY TYPE OF HEALTH REFORM I

04:29:25.883 --> 04:29:26.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE SOME OF THE SCARS ON MY

04:29:26.450 --> 04:29:27.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
BACK.

04:29:27.184 --> 04:29:30.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO SHOW FOR IT AND IT IS THE.

04:29:30.220 --> 04:29:32.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT IT'S

04:29:32.322 --> 04:29:33.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVING TO FIGURE OUT A LOT OF

04:29:33.624 --> 04:29:35.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
DIFFERENT.

04:29:35.559 --> 04:29:37.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A EACH GET TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT

04:29:37.327 --> 04:29:38.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OBSTACLES AT ONCE IT'S ALMOST

04:29:38.562 --> 04:29:39.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LIKE THREADING MULTIPLE NEEDLES

04:29:39.429 --> 04:29:40.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
AT ONCE

04:29:40.831 --> 04:29:42.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M THERE IS THE THE POLITICAL

04:29:42.366 --> 04:29:43.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
FORCES OF INDUSTRY AND

04:29:43.767 --> 04:29:45.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IDEOLOGICAL OPPOSITIONS THERE'S.

04:29:45.502 --> 04:29:46.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU KNOW TRYING TO GET PUBLIC

04:29:46.904 --> 04:29:47.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ACCEPTANCE ESPECIALLY IF

04:29:47.838 --> 04:29:48.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SOMETHING.

04:29:48.272 --> 04:29:50.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IF IF YOU HAVE TO REPLACE THE

04:29:50.374 --> 04:29:51.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COVERAGE THAT PEOPLE ARE USED TO

04:29:51.575 --> 04:29:52.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT EVEN IF

04:29:52.743 --> 04:29:54.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER. IF IT'S

THEM FOR. ANOTHER OPTION THAT IS

04:48:15.311 --> 04:48:16.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
BEING THAT.

04:48:16.746 --> 04:48:17.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
WE WOULD.

04:48:17.246 --> 04:48:19.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THE COMMITTEE SHOULD LOOK

04:48:19.315 --> 04:48:21.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INTO IS WITH REGARD TO MAKING

04:48:21.917 --> 04:48:24.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SURE THAT NO CALIFORNIANS

04:48:24.186 --> 04:48:25.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SPECIALLY THOSE ARE BETTER IN

04:48:25.554 --> 04:48:27.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
RURAL AREAS ARE LEFT.

04:48:27.223 --> 04:48:28.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WITHOUT ANY COVERAGE OPTIONS

04:48:29.025 --> 04:48:29.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
WHATSOEVER.

04:48:29.859 --> 04:48:32.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE ISSUE OF BEAR COUNTIES YEAH

04:48:32.962 --> 04:48:34.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EASE ONE THAT SOME OTHER STATES

04:48:34.563 --> 04:48:36.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
HAVE DEALT WITH AND.

04:48:36.098 --> 04:48:37.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:48:37.500 --> 04:48:38.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHETHER IT'S THAT NORTH OF

04:48:38.768 --> 04:48:41.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SACRAMENTO REGION OR CENTRAL

COAST OVER OUR CENTRAL VALLEY

04:48:44.674 --> 04:48:47.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DEAD A CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT ARE

04:48:48.010 --> 04:48:49.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NOT LEFT WITHOUT A COVERAGE

04:48:49.845 --> 04:48:55.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OPTION. AND IF IF IF THERE IS AN

04:48:55.685 --> 04:48:55.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
ISSUE WITH.

04:48:55.985 --> 04:48:57.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

04:48:57.887 --> 04:48:58.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I AND IF AT THAT IF THAT ISSUE

04:48:59.021 --> 04:49:00.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOES COME UP ABOUT THAT WE HAVE

04:49:00.322 --> 04:49:01.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
WE USE THE MEDIC HOW

04:49:01.123 --> 04:49:02.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TO MAKE

04:49:02.091 --> 04:49:02.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHETHER TO THE MEDICARE MANAGED

04:49:02.758 --> 04:49:03.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CARE PLANS ARE THE EXISTING

04:49:03.526 --> 04:49:04.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

04:49:04.160 --> 04:49:05.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
IS AN OPTION.

04:49:05.227 --> 04:49:05.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FINAL THING I'D JUST LIKE TO

04:49:05.995 --> 04:49:06.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WRAP UP IS THAT AGAIN WE THINK

04:49:07.029 --> 04:49:07.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THERE IS AN ASPIRATIONAL

04:49:07.797 --> 04:49:09.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AGENDA HERE AS COMPLEMENTARY

04:49:09.398 --> 04:49:10.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WITH THE BROADER LONG IT'S A

04:49:11.000 --> 04:49:12.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
VISION THAT IS ON. AT A

04:49:12.401 --> 04:49:13.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DIFFERENT TIME TABLE TO

04:49:13.903 --> 04:49:15.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DO THAT IN THE NEXT YEAR THE

04:49:15.771 --> 04:49:17.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
NEXT COUPLE YEARS TO THAT IT
ARE.

04:49:17.773 --> 04:49:18.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE WITHOUT

04:49:18.808 --> 04:49:20.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FEDERAL APPROVAL TO STABILIZE

04:49:20.710 --> 04:49:21.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE MARKET AND RESISTANCE

04:49:21.477 --> 04:49:23.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ADVERTISE TO GET TO UNIVERSALITY

04:49:23.279 --> 04:49:24.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN AFFORDABILITY AND TO START

04:49:24.747 --> 04:49:26.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF COST

04:49:26.082 --> 04:49:26.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
QUALITY IN EQUITY.

04:49:26.515 --> 04:49:28.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

04:49:28.918 --> 04:49:32.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
AND I THE.

04:49:32.088 --> 04:49:33.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE ARGUMENT THAT HAS BEEN MADE

04:49:33.823 --> 04:49:35.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
BY SOME ON.

04:49:35.324 --> 04:49:37.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
YOUR SENATOR TED  Z

04:49:37.226 --> 04:49:39.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OTHERS SAY THAT THE AFFORDABLE

04:49:39.095 --> 04:49:40.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CARE ACT WAS A SLIPPERY SLOPE TO

04:49:40.196 --> 04:49:42.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
SINGLE PAYER.

04:49:42.264 --> 04:49:43.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE I

04:49:43.966 --> 04:49:45.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THINK DAD'S.

04:49:45.768 --> 04:49:47.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HE ARE HE WAS HE WAS WRONG HE

04:49:47.703 --> 04:49:49.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
GOT THE METAPHOR REVERSE

04:49:49.271 --> 04:49:52.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IT'S A. IT'S A IT'S NOT.

04:49:52.174 --> 04:49:53.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE

04:49:53.375 --> 04:49:55.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CLOSER BUT IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S

04:49:55.077 --> 04:49:56.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOT GOING IT'S NOT SO BE SLOWED

04:49:56.312 --> 04:49:56.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOWN THE MATHIS SCALING UP THE

04:49:56.912 --> 04:49:58.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
MOUNTAIN.

04:49:58.380 --> 04:49:59.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S HOW CAN WE CAN DO AND THE

04:50:00.049 --> 04:50:00.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
QUESTION IS HOW DO WE CONTINUE

04:50:00.916 --> 04:50:02.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO GO UP ENOUGH AND TO THE GO TO

04:50:02.284 --> 04:50:04.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE VISION OF EVERYBODY HAVING.

04:50:04.420 --> 04:50:05.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE CARE THAT THEY NEED WHEN

04:50:05.721 --> 04:50:06.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY NEED IT WITHOUT FINANCIAL

04:50:06.522 --> 04:50:08.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BARRIERS AND WHAT WE THINK IS

04:50:08.724 --> 04:50:10.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THE STEPS ACTUALLY GETS

04:50:10.726 --> 04:50:12.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT MUCH CLOSER ACTUALLY DID

04:50:12.394 --> 04:50:14.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

04:50:14.196 --> 04:50:15.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THE

04:50:15.197 --> 04:50:16.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POLICY INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET TO

04:50:16.832 --> 04:50:18.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT GOAL AND THAT'S WHY WE

04:50:18.267 --> 04:50:19.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINK THAT WE DON'T WE GET WE

04:50:19.568 --> 04:50:20.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DON'T SHOULDN'T WAIT FOR FEDERAL

04:50:21.003 --> 04:50:23.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
APPROVALS OR THE OTHER OBSTACLES

04:50:23.105 --> 04:50:24.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
ARE NO WAY WE CAN TAKE STEPS
NOW.

04:52:46.081 --> 04:52:48.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT OUR MEMBERS DIDN'T EITHER.

04:52:48.117 --> 04:52:49.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

SOMEONE FROM FOR MONTHS OFFERED

05:00:10.692 --> 05:00:12.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS.

05:00:12.227 --> 05:00:13.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT I THOUGHT WERE WERE VERY

05:00:13.895 --> 05:00:15.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
APT TO START MY PRESENTATION HE

05:00:15.630 --> 05:00:16.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SAID THAT THE RISING COST OF

05:00:16.965 --> 05:00:18.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HEALTHCARE ALSO APPLIES TO

05:00:18.834 --> 05:00:20.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE.

05:00:20.669 --> 05:00:21.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHETHER YOU PAY FOR IT THROUGH

05:00:21.536 --> 05:00:23.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
PUBLIC FUNDS.

05:00:23.105 --> 05:00:24.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OR THROUGH THE CURRENT PRIVATE

05:00:24.272 --> 05:00:26.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

05:00:26.141 --> 05:00:28.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NO SYSTEM WILL WORK UNLESS WE

05:00:28.744 --> 05:00:30.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FIND A WAY TO CUT THE RISING

05:00:30.278 --> 05:00:32.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
COST OF HEALTHCARE.

05:00:32.547 --> 05:00:34.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND HE RECOMMENDED TO CALIFORNIA

05:00:34.483 --> 05:00:36.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAT WE GET COSTS COULD

05:00:36.118 --> 05:00:38.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONTAINMENT RIGHT FIRST AND THEN

05:00:38.987 --> 05:00:39.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE CAN CONSOLIDATE INTO A SINGLE

05:00:40.021 --> 05:00:42.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
PAYER SYSTEM.

05:00:42.691 --> 05:00:44.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THE LABOR FEDERATION. KNOWS

05:00:44.626 --> 05:00:45.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOW IMPORTANT COST CONTAINMENT

05:00:45.994 --> 05:00:48.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO PETER

05:00:48.130 --> 05:00:50.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TALK AND AND NOT FEEL THE

05:00:50.599 --> 05:00:52.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
URGENCY OF HAVING TO DO TO BE

05:00:52.534 --> 05:00:54.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABLE TO GET COSTS UNDER CONTROL.

05:00:55.003 --> 05:00:56.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND WE'VE TRIED EVERY YEAR TO

05:00:56.938 --> 05:00:58.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOCUS ON SMALL PARTS OF THE

05:00:58.807 --> 05:01:00.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INDUSTRY TO DO THAT WE'VE MOVED.

05:01:00.509 --> 05:01:02.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BILLS AROUND AND THE PRICE OF

05:01:02.344 --> 05:01:03.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHRISTIAN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WE

05:01:04.012 --> 05:01:06.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUPPORTED MISTER WOODS BILL ON

05:01:06.248 --> 05:01:07.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS WE'VE

05:01:07.949 --> 05:01:09.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DONE WORK ON INSURANCE COMPANIES

05:01:09.317 --> 05:01:11.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
AND HEALTH PLANS.

05:01:11.086 --> 05:01:12.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND WE'VE LOOKED AT THE ANTI

05:01:12.988 --> 05:01:16.258 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
COMPETITIVE PRICING OF
HOSPITALS.

05:01:16.324 --> 05:01:18.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BUT THROUGH ALL OF THAT.

05:01:18.760 --> 05:01:21.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE STILL SEE THAT EVERY DOLLAR

05:01:21.797 --> 05:01:23.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WE HAVE TO SPEND ON RISING

05:01:23.732 --> 05:01:25.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
HEALTH CARE PRICES.

05:01:25.600 --> 05:01:26.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS A DOLLAR THAT'S COMING RIGHT

05:01:26.735 --> 05:01:28.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
OUT A WORKERS POCKETS.

05:01:28.670 --> 05:01:31.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO WE KNOW THROUGH DESPITE

05:01:31.473 --> 05:01:33.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO TACKLE

05:01:33.875 --> 05:01:35.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE ISSUE OF COST CONTAINMENT

05:01:35.410 --> 05:01:36.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE WE ARE GOING UP AGAINST

05:01:36.778 --> 05:01:38.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY.

05:01:38.980 --> 05:01:40.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BUT IT IS CRITICAL IT IS

05:01:40.382 --> 05:01:42.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CRITICAL BOTH AS A FIRST STEP TO

05:01:42.250 --> 05:01:44.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SINGLE PAYER AND IT IS CRITICAL

05:01:44.886 --> 05:01:45.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TO WORKING PEOPLE AND TO

05:01:45.720 --> 05:01:47.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
CALIFORNIANS.

05:01:47.522 --> 05:01:49.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

05:01:49.391 --> 05:01:51.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO YOU SEE IF I CAN USE THIS.

05:01:51.326 --> 05:01:53.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OKAY SO THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE

05:01:53.695 --> 05:01:56.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF WHAT WE'RE SUFFERING FROM.

05:01:56.164 --> 05:01:58.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BILL TWO LINES GOING UP OUR

05:01:58.133 --> 05:01:58.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
PREMIUMS AN EMPLOYEE

05:01:58.967 --> 05:02:01.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CONTRIBUTIONS TO PREMIUMS.

05:02:01.803 --> 05:02:03.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE FLAT LINES OUR WAGES AND

05:02:03.605 --> 05:02:06.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
INFLATION.

05:02:06.241 --> 05:02:08.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
AND IN THAT GAP.

05:02:08.243 --> 05:02:09.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT IS THE WHOLE WHERE ARE

05:02:09.911 --> 05:02:11.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MIDDLE CLASS IS FALLING.

05:02:11.780 --> 05:02:13.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT IS WHAT IS EATING UP OUR

05:02:13.982 --> 05:02:14.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MIDDLE CLASS IN THE STATE OF

05:02:14.716 --> 05:02:17.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
CALIFORNIA.

05:02:17.085 --> 05:02:18.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO ON THIS SIDE YOU ALSO SEE IN

05:02:18.987 --> 05:02:19.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIS IS BEEN EMPHASIZED OVER AND

05:02:19.988 --> 05:02:22.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OVER THAT THE U. S. SPENDS

05:02:22.290 --> 05:02:23.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ALMOST TWICE WHAT OTHER

05:02:23.358 --> 05:02:25.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COUNTRIES SPEND ON HEALTHCARE.

05:02:26.061 --> 05:02:27.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT AN INTERESTING PART OF THIS

05:02:27.662 --> 05:02:29.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SLIDE IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE DARK

05:02:29.231 --> 05:02:30.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
BLUE LINE.

05:02:30.832 --> 05:02:33.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT'S PUBLIC EXPENDITURE.

05:02:33.768 --> 05:02:35.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S KIND OF ON PAR OR LESS

05:02:35.971 --> 05:02:37.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAN WHAT A LOT OF OTHER

05:02:37.072 --> 05:02:39.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COUNTRIES SPEND OUR REAL PROBLEM

05:02:39.441 --> 05:02:41.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET.

05:02:41.476 --> 05:02:43.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THE MARKET WHERE WE HAVE OUR

05:02:43.245 --> 05:02:44.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TRUST FUNDS THE INDIVIDUAL THE

05:02:44.880 --> 05:02:46.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SMALL THE LARGE GROUP THE SELF

05:02:46.715 --> 05:02:48.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INSURED THAT'S WHERE SPENDING IS

05:02:48.984 --> 05:02:51.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.

05:02:52.053 --> 05:02:53.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WHAT WE CAN SEE IS THAT ALL

05:02:53.989 --> 05:02:55.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF THESE COUNTRIES HERE.

05:02:55.757 --> 05:02:57.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE ONE THING THAT THEY ALL HAVE

05:02:57.392 --> 05:02:58.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
IN COMMON.

05:02:58.827 --> 05:02:59.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES WITH

05:03:00.061 --> 05:03:01.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE HAVE IN

05:03:01.663 --> 05:03:03.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMMON WHETHER THERE A SINGLE

05:03:03.632 --> 05:03:04.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PAYER SYSTEM OR A MULTI PAYER

05:03:04.666 --> 05:03:06.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SYSTEM.

05:03:07.002 --> 05:03:08.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT

05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:10.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REGULATE HEALTH CARE PRICES AND

05:03:10.539 --> 05:03:11.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONTROLS COSTS THROUGHOUT THE

IS THAT IT REALLY IS THE PRICES.

05:03:26.788 --> 05:03:27.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE HEALTH CARE SPENDING OUR

05:03:28.056 --> 05:03:29.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

05:03:30.058 --> 05:03:31.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
PRICE.

05:03:31.793 --> 05:03:33.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
TIMES UTILIZATION

05:03:33.962 --> 05:03:34.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND IF YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS

05:03:34.529 --> 05:03:35.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
GRAPH.

05:03:36.031 --> 05:03:36.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

IS UTILIZATION.

05:03:44.539 --> 05:03:46.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
SO EVEN THE U. S..

05:03:46.575 --> 05:03:49.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE ARE USING LAST HEALTH CARE.

05:03:49.210 --> 05:03:51.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

AND SO PRICES ARE WHAT ARE

05:04:05.060 --> 05:04:08.163 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
DRIVING OVERALL COSTS IN THIS

PLANS

05:04:19.774 --> 05:04:20.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND IF YOU LOOK THROUGH THOSE

05:04:20.942 --> 05:04:23.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEARING HERE THAT FILINGS. YOU

05:04:23.111 --> 05:04:24.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

05:04:24.212 --> 05:04:27.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SLIDE UTILIZATION REMAINS FLAT.

05:04:27.482 --> 05:04:29.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PRICES ARE SKYROCKETING AND THAT

05:04:29.985 --> 05:04:30.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IS WHAT IS DRIVING PREMIUM

05:04:30.852 --> 05:04:35.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
INCREASES.

05:04:35.857 --> 05:04:37.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE

05:04:37.592 --> 05:04:39.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE PRICES HIGH

05:04:39.828 --> 05:04:41.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
BUT THEY VARY WILDLY.

05:04:41.796 --> 05:04:43.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF

05:04:43.898 --> 05:04:45.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE RANGE OF M. ARISE IN THE

05:04:45.800 --> 05:04:47.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

DOLLARS.

05:04:54.109 --> 05:04:55.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE HOSPITAL'S

05:04:55.276 --> 05:04:56.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER

05:04:56.911 --> 05:04:58.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT ARE CHARGING THIS VARIATION

05:04:58.480 --> 05:04:59.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PRICES SOMETIMES YOU HAVE

05:04:59.514 --> 05:05:01.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PATIENTS IN THE SAME HOSPITAL

05:05:01.616 --> 05:05:03.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR THE SAME SERVICE. THAT ARE

05:05:03.485 --> 05:05:05.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PAYING WILDLY DIFFERENT PRICES

05:05:05.220 --> 05:05:07.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DEPENDING ON. WHO HAS THE

05:05:07.155 --> 05:05:08.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COVERAGE OF THEIR AYE MEDICARE

05:05:08.523 --> 05:05:10.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
AND MEDICAID?

05:05:10.225 --> 05:05:12.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT NOT

05:05:12.394 --> 05:05:12.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ONLY WERE THE PRICES ARE TOO

05:05:12.961 --> 05:05:15.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HIGH BUT THEY ARE OPAQUE. AND

05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:17.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE SO

05:05:17.265 --> 05:05:17.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THERE'S MASSIVE PRICE

05:05:17.932 --> 05:05:19.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
DISCRIMINATION.

05:05:19.834 --> 05:05:21.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

05:05:21.136 --> 05:05:24.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
AND SO.

05:05:24.105 --> 05:05:25.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS?

05:05:25.373 --> 05:05:27.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PETER IS SAD THAT CALPERS IN

05:05:28.009 --> 05:05:29.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SOME OF THAT THE LARGEST

05:05:29.744 --> 05:05:31.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EMPLOYERS IN THE LARGEST UNIONS

DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GAIN

05:05:36.151 --> 05:05:37.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CONTROL OVER THE PROBLEM OF

05:05:37.752 --> 05:05:39.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
COSTS.

05:05:39.454 --> 05:05:41.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY'VE TRIED TO USE THE TOOLS

05:05:41.823 --> 05:05:43.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF TRANSPARENCY THEY'VE TRIED TO

05:05:44.025 --> 05:05:46.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DO BENEFIT DESIGN REFERENCE

05:05:46.194 --> 05:05:47.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PRICING.

05:05:47.228 --> 05:05:48.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE OFFERS OF

05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:50.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

05:05:54.369 --> 05:05:56.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SELVES AS PURCHASERS TO REALLY

05:05:56.771 --> 05:05:59.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
GET COSTS UNDER CONTROL.

05:05:59.441 --> 05:06:01.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT WE ARE STILL AT THE POINT

05:06:01.176 --> 05:06:03.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHERE THE PRICES ARE GOING UP.

05:06:04.045 --> 05:06:06.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE KEEP HAVING TO PAY THEM.

05:06:06.247 --> 05:06:08.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND IT IS GETTING TO THE POINT

05:06:08.183 --> 05:06:09.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
TO BE A REAL CRISIS IS

05:06:09.250 --> 05:06:11.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNSUSTAINABLE. AND THAT IS WHY

05:06:11.553 --> 05:06:13.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE REALLY DO NEED LEGISLATORS

05:06:13.922 --> 05:06:15.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND DO NEED THE GOVERNMENT

05:06:15.223 --> 05:06:17.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
POLICY MAKERS TO TAKE BOLD

05:06:17.225 --> 05:06:19.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACTION TO REALLY EFFECTIVELY DO

05:06:19.661 --> 05:06:20.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

05:06:20.762 --> 05:06:27.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY.

05:06:27.368 --> 05:06:28.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'D I DON'T THAT'S THE EASY PART

05:06:28.737 --> 05:06:30.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
USE THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM

05:06:30.138 --> 05:06:30.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
OKAY WHAT WE DO.

05:06:30.538 --> 05:06:33.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

05:06:33.475 --> 05:06:35.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO I WOULD SAY THAT EVEN KNOW

05:06:35.744 --> 05:06:38.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AMAZON AND I'D JPMORGAN CHASE IN

WE DON'T REALLY NEED BIG

05:06:44.319 --> 05:06:45.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMPANIES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

05:06:45.920 --> 05:06:47.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WHAT TO DO ABOUT COST

05:06:47.455 --> 05:06:49.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CONTAINMENT THIS COUNTRY.

05:06:49.157 --> 05:06:51.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT TO DO WE

05:06:51.526 --> 05:06:52.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ALREADY HAVE SOME REALLY

05:06:52.660 --> 05:06:54.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
INCREDIBLE EXAMPLES IN THIS

05:06:54.729 --> 05:06:56.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COUNTRY OF HOW WE CAN START TO

05:06:56.598 --> 05:06:59.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
GET COSTS UNDER CONTROL.

05:06:59.300 --> 05:07:00.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I'M SO I WILL START WITH

05:07:00.802 --> 05:07:02.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
MEDICARE.

05:07:02.804 --> 05:07:04.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
MEDICARE IS.

05:07:05.039 --> 05:07:07.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A PROGRAM THAT YOU KNOW EVERYONE

05:07:07.242 --> 05:07:08.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT GETTING GOVERNOR SOMEONE

05:07:08.543 --> 05:07:09.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAID WAS THE ONLY GOOD REASON TO

05:07:09.978 --> 05:07:11.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
TURN SIXTY FIVE.

05:07:11.146 --> 05:07:13.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WAS TO GET ON TO MEDICARE.

05:07:13.381 --> 05:07:16.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT IS THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT IS

05:07:16.417 --> 05:07:19.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRANSPARENT AND PUBLIC IN THE

05:07:19.220 --> 05:07:20.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WAY THAT IT SETS RATES.

05:07:21.055 --> 05:07:23.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT SETS RATES THAT ARE PAID TO

05:07:23.324 --> 05:07:25.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOSPITALS TO DOCTORS AND FOR OUT

05:07:26.027 --> 05:07:27.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
PATIENT SERVICES.

05:07:27.929 --> 05:07:30.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S A MODEL THAT NOT ONLY COULD

05:07:30.665 --> 05:07:32.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SERVE AS A MODEL FOR CALIFORNIA

05:07:32.300 --> 05:07:33.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT HAS ALSO BEEN ADOPTED BY

05:07:34.035 --> 05:07:36.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING FRANCE

05:07:36.271 --> 05:07:38.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
GERMANY AND AUSTRALIA.

05:07:38.072 --> 05:07:39.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEY'VE A PRIDE APPLIED IT

05:07:39.707 --> 05:07:41.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WAY MORE BROADLY THAN JUST FOR

05:07:41.342 --> 05:07:42.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE THEY'VE

05:07:42.844 --> 05:07:44.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
APPLIED AT A TO THE COMMERCIAL

05:07:44.145 --> 05:07:46.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MARKET AS WELL. AND YOU CAN SEE

05:07:46.114 --> 05:07:47.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT IN THAT THE PLIGHT THAT I

05:07:47.549 --> 05:07:48.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PRESENTED AT THE COST SAVINGS

05:07:48.750 --> 05:07:50.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THAT THEY HAVE.

05:07:51.019 --> 05:07:53.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT ALSO IS FLEXIBLE IN THAT IT'S

05:07:53.454 --> 05:07:55.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL RATES

05:07:55.423 --> 05:07:56.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
RATES ARE ADJUSTED THEIR

05:07:56.925 --> 05:07:58.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ADJUSTED FOR REGIONAL

05:07:58.526 --> 05:08:00.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

SERVICES THAT ARE

05:08:03.932 --> 05:08:05.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THAT

05:08:05.767 --> 05:08:07.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SERVE MORE LOW INCOME OR

05:08:07.302 --> 05:08:09.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
MEDICAID PATIENTS.

05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:10.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND AND SO THERE IS SOME

05:08:10.538 --> 05:08:11.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO THE

05:08:11.439 --> 05:08:14.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SYSTEM.

05:08:14.108 --> 05:08:15.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ANOTHER GREAT THING ABOUT

05:08:15.877 --> 05:08:17.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MEDICARE AS A MODEL IS THAT

05:08:17.979 --> 05:08:19.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE IS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND

05:08:20.048 --> 05:08:22.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

ADVANTAGE PLANS.

05:08:34.562 --> 05:08:35.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IN THIS IS WHERE THERE'S A

05:08:35.897 --> 05:08:38.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAPITATED RATE THAT IS PAID SO

05:08:38.132 --> 05:08:39.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT'S NOT JUST A MODEL FOR FEE

05:08:39.767 --> 05:08:41.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FOR SERVICE BUT FOR OTHER

05:08:41.536 --> 05:08:44.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

LIKE MODEL AND THEY SAY. OKAY.

05:09:29.550 --> 05:09:30.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CHARGE

MEDICARE DID RUN INTO SOME

05:09:47.535 --> 05:09:49.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ISSUES IN THAT

05:09:49.470 --> 05:09:50.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OR IT'S AYE MARYLAND INTO SOME

05:09:50.638 --> 05:09:52.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ISSUES IN THAT.

05:09:52.674 --> 05:09:53.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHEN YOU SQUEEZE THE BALLOON AT

05:09:53.942 --> 05:09:55.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ONE END.

05:09:55.777 --> 05:09:57.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMETIMES EXPANDS AT THE OTHER

05:09:57.445 --> 05:09:59.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
END AND SO YOU HAVE TO BE

05:09:59.347 --> 05:10:00.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAREFUL IN TO ONE OF THE ISSUES

05:10:00.748 --> 05:10:02.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAS THAT IF YOU JUST LOOK AT

05:10:02.417 --> 05:10:03.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
PRICE.

05:10:03.952 --> 05:10:06.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU MAY HAVE A GROWTH IN THE

05:10:06.254 --> 05:10:08.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
VOLUME OF SERVICES IN THE

05:10:08.156 --> 05:10:10.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INTENSITY OF SERVICES IT MIGHT

05:10:10.692 --> 05:10:12.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT ACCOUNT FOR IF YOU'RE JUST

05:10:12.627 --> 05:10:14.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOOKING AT HOSPITAL'S SHIFTS TO

05:10:14.128 --> 05:10:15.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
OUT PATIENT SETTINGS.

05:10:15.763 --> 05:10:16.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO RATE

05:10:17.065 --> 05:10:18.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SETTING.

05:10:19.033 --> 05:10:21.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND EVEN IN THAT SITUATION WHERE

05:10:21.436 --> 05:10:22.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
YOU'RE CONTROLLING PRICE

05:10:22.971 --> 05:10:24.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU MIGHT STILL HAVE AN INCREASE

05:10:25.039 --> 05:10:27.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN OVERALL SPENDING BECAUSE YOUR

05:10:27.375 --> 05:10:29.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
NOT LOOKING AT THAT.

05:10:29.310 --> 05:10:30.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FULL BALLOON TIME TO CONTINUE

05:10:30.912 --> 05:10:32.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THE EXAMPLE.

05:10:32.547 --> 05:10:34.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO MARILYN RESPONDED TO THAT

05:10:34.682 --> 05:10:37.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ISSUE BY. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

05:10:37.485 --> 05:10:39.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
ADDING A BUDGET CAP

05:10:39.287 --> 05:10:40.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO BASICALLY SAYING WE'RE GONNA

05:10:40.755 --> 05:10:44.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LOOK AT OVERALL HOW MUCH.

05:10:44.158 --> 05:10:45.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HEALTHCARE SPENDING THERE IS

05:10:45.693 --> 05:10:47.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACROSS THE SYSTEM WHILE KEEPING

05:10:47.862 --> 05:10:49.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN PLACE THE RATE SETTING THAT

05:10:49.897 --> 05:10:51.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY'VE HAD SINCE THE SEVENTIES

05:10:51.399 --> 05:10:52.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE GONNA SEE

05:10:52.533 --> 05:10:54.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SOME GOOD RESULTS FROM THAT

05:10:54.736 --> 05:10:57.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THERE ARE MODELS OUT THERE

05:10:57.105 --> 05:10:59.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON

05:10:59.374 --> 05:11:00.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EFFECTIVE COST CONTAINMENT THAT

05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:02.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
WILL.

05:11:02.410 --> 05:11:04.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALLY DO SOMETHING FOR PETER'S

05:11:04.545 --> 05:11:05.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LOCAL AND FOR PEOPLE IN THE

05:11:05.913 --> 05:11:07.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
COMMERCIAL MARKET.

05:11:07.448 --> 05:11:09.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU

05:11:09.083 --> 05:11:12.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WITH A FULL PROPOSAL THAT.

05:11:12.520 --> 05:11:14.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE DO HAVE SOME KIND OF CORE

05:11:14.255 --> 05:11:16.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PRINCIPLES AS WE MOVE FORWARD

05:11:16.224 --> 05:11:18.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOOKING AT AT COST CONTAINMENT.

05:11:18.526 --> 05:11:21.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONE IS THAT IT BUILDS TOWARDS A

05:11:21.329 --> 05:11:22.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNIVERSAL SINGLE SINGLE PAYER

05:11:22.497 --> 05:11:24.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SYSTEM.

05:11:24.665 --> 05:11:26.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THIS IS ONE ELEMENT OF IT A

05:11:26.534 --> 05:11:28.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KEY ELEMENTS AND AN ELEMENT THAT

05:11:28.770 --> 05:11:32.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WILL. IMPACT PEOPLE RIGHT NOW.

05:11:32.340 --> 05:11:33.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE NEED TO REALLY GET CONTROL

05:11:33.875 --> 05:11:34.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ABOUT HOW MUCH OUR PEOPLE ARE

05:11:34.976 --> 05:11:38.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SPENDING ON HEALTHCARE.

05:11:38.479 --> 05:11:39.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THIS THE COST CONTAINMENT

05:11:39.981 --> 05:11:42.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAS THE OVERALL GOAL OF COMPLETE

05:11:42.717 --> 05:11:44.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
OF CONTAINING COSTS.

05:11:44.685 --> 05:11:45.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHICH YOU NEED TO LOOK AT AS

05:11:45.987 --> 05:11:48.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
BOTH THE PRICE.

05:11:48.389 --> 05:11:50.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
AND UTILIZATION.

05:11:50.591 --> 05:11:53.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT IT INCREASES QUALITY.

05:11:53.428 --> 05:11:55.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IT IMPROVES HEALTH OUTCOMES

05:11:55.596 --> 05:11:57.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ONE BECAUSE WE CARE VERY MUCH

05:32:06.840 --> 05:32:08.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
CAN PROVIDE WHAT KIND OF
SAVINGS.

05:32:08.275 --> 05:32:09.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AN OFFSETTING SAVINGS THERE ARE

05:32:09.976 --> 05:32:11.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IN TERMS OF

05:32:11.678 --> 05:32:14.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCALE. THAT YOU'RE QUITE DE YAH

05:32:14.681 --> 05:32:15.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I KNOW YOU HAD YOUR DIALOGUE

05:32:16.016 --> 05:32:16.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH THE LA O. ON MONDAY AND.

05:32:16.616 --> 05:32:18.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
I WOULD SAY THAT.

05:32:18.685 --> 05:32:19.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOW TO DO THE WHOLE THING ABOUT

05:32:19.919 --> 05:32:21.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WITH THE ADDITIONAL? COVERED

05:32:21.955 --> 05:32:23.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALIFORNIA AND THE IN THE HEALTH

05:32:23.657 --> 05:32:25.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR ALL WE ARE EXPANDING MEDICAL

05:32:25.358 --> 05:32:27.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNDOCUMENTED WOULD BE LESS THAN

05:32:27.294 --> 05:32:29.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAY WHAT WE WHAT WE RAISED UNDER

05:32:29.462 --> 05:32:30.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
PROP THIRTY.

05:32:30.697 --> 05:32:32.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LIKE IT IS A IT IS A. IT IS NOT

05:32:32.866 --> 05:32:34.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE SORT OF THE TENS OF BILLIONS

05:32:34.668 --> 05:32:36.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE

05:32:36.336 --> 05:32:37.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WOULD HAVE LOST UNDER THE

05:32:37.937 --> 05:32:39.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VARIOUS FEDERAL PROPOSALS THAT

05:32:39.939 --> 05:32:41.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE WERE CONSIDERING LAST YEAR

05:32:41.708 --> 05:32:43.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LET IT TO IT. IT'S AND IT'S IT'S

05:32:43.109 --> 05:32:44.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A SCALE THAT IS DOABLE WE UP THE

05:32:44.411 --> 05:32:45.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HOPE THAT WE CAN EVEN MAKE

05:32:45.512 --> 05:32:47.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROGRESS WITHIN THE BUDGET. BUT.

05:32:47.113 --> 05:32:48.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT BUT TO DO THE WHOLE THING

05:32:48.948 --> 05:32:50.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD BE IT WOULD REQUIRE SOME

05:32:50.817 --> 05:32:52.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RAISING REVENUES BUT BUT ON A

05:32:52.786 --> 05:32:54.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SCALE THAT WOULD BEASTS

05:32:54.821 --> 05:32:56.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
CERTAINLY MANAGEABLE.

05:32:56.756 --> 05:32:57.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEN A FOLLOW UP FOR THAT.

05:32:57.390 --> 05:32:58.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
YOU TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE

05:32:58.358 --> 05:32:59.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PRICES NO UNJUSTIFIED MEDICAL

05:32:59.759 --> 05:33:01.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BILLS BEYOND BENCHMARKS DE OF

05:33:01.127 --> 05:33:02.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SPECIFICITY AND WHAT THAT LOOKS

05:33:02.696 --> 05:33:04.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LIKE IT'S THIS SOUNDS LIKE. THE

05:33:04.731 --> 05:33:05.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
OP HERE CAP

05:33:05.999 --> 05:33:06.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT FROM MARYLAND AND I'M NOT

05:33:06.966 --> 05:33:09.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SURE IF YOU MEANT THAT TO BE THE

05:33:09.169 --> 05:33:10.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CASE BUT CURE SO I MEAN I THINK

05:33:10.170 --> 05:33:11.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE ARE DIFFERENT MODELS ABOUT

05:33:11.371 --> 05:33:13.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOW YOU COULD DO A A HOW YOU

05:33:13.073 --> 05:33:14.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COULD DO THIS I THINK YOU COULD

05:33:14.974 --> 05:33:15.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
LOOK AT.

05:33:15.208 --> 05:33:16.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

05:33:16.376 --> 05:33:18.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BY YOU AGAIN ESPECIALLY SINCE SO

05:33:18.144 --> 05:33:19.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MANY PROVIDERS DO TAKE MEDICARE

05:33:19.946 --> 05:33:21.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOKING AT THAT AS A AS A AS A

05:33:21.681 --> 05:33:23.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STARTING POINT BUT AND THEN

05:33:23.216 --> 05:33:24.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEEING WHERE THERE NEEDS TO BE

05:33:24.250 --> 05:33:25.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADJUSTMENTS ACCORDINGLY SIMILAR

05:33:25.885 --> 05:33:27.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO HOW TO SURPRISE MEDICAL BILL

05:33:27.554 --> 05:33:28.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
LAW THAT.

05:33:28.355 --> 05:33:30.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIS LEGISLATURE ADOPTED NOT

05:33:30.457 --> 05:33:32.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TOO LONG AGO DID DID WHERE YOU

05:33:32.625 --> 05:33:34.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
START WITH A CERTAIN OF

05:33:34.127 --> 05:33:35.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BENCHMARK WOULDN'T ALLOW IT

05:33:35.595 --> 05:33:37.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS TO GO

05:33:37.163 --> 05:33:38.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OVER IT I THINK THERE ARE OTHER

05:33:38.498 --> 05:33:40.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MODELS AS WELL SO I DID I. I

05:33:40.433 --> 05:33:41.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK YOU KNOW YOU YOU COULD SEE

05:33:41.768 --> 05:33:43.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MARILYN'S ONE MODEL WE CAN

05:33:43.570 --> 05:33:45.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GREATER ON CALIFORNIA MODEL BUT

05:33:45.839 --> 05:33:47.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THIS IS THE MECHANISM THAT.

05:33:47.240 --> 05:33:50.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE WHETHER

05:33:50.110 --> 05:33:51.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
BY.

05:33:51.277 --> 05:33:53.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EIGHT EIGHT IN ORDER TO DEAL

05:33:53.813 --> 05:33:56.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH THE ISSUE OF WHY ARE PRICES

05:33:56.149 --> 05:33:58.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO HIGH AND WHY DO THEY GO UP

05:33:58.518 --> 05:34:00.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HIGHER I MEAN AS WE SAID WITH

05:34:00.754 --> 05:34:03.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. YEAH

05:34:03.390 --> 05:34:05.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S WHEN WINDOWS PRICES GO UP

05:34:05.625 --> 05:34:09.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BY THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED

05:34:09.162 --> 05:34:09.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT IT'S NOT

05:34:09.763 --> 05:34:10.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
LIKE THE.

05:34:10.230 --> 05:34:11.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MADE IT MEDICATION BECAME THREE

05:34:11.164 --> 05:34:11.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED FIVE

05:34:11.731 --> 05:34:12.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PERCENT MORE EFFECTIVE.

05:34:12.932 --> 05:34:14.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
SO SO SO THEN.

05:34:14.734 --> 05:34:15.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO WHAT IS WHAT IS THE ISSUE

05:34:15.635 --> 05:34:17.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND YOU KNOW AGAIN WE DO THIS IN

05:34:17.837 --> 05:34:18.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE PUBLIC UTILITY WORLD AS WELL

05:34:18.938 --> 05:34:20.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WELL AND YOU KNOW THAT'S AND

05:34:20.507 --> 05:34:21.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MAYBE NOT THE PERFECT MODEL BUT.

05:34:21.975 --> 05:34:23.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN THERE

05:34:23.443 --> 05:34:25.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS A AYE A CONCENTRATED MONOPOLY

05:34:26.045 --> 05:34:27.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR IN THE CENTER OR OLIGOPOLY

05:34:27.814 --> 05:34:30.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOR AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE THAT

05:34:30.717 --> 05:34:32.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'VE IT WE TRY TO SAY OF A DAD.

05:34:32.185 --> 05:34:33.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE OF THE COMPANIES PROVIDING

05:34:33.653 --> 05:34:33.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
IT CAN.

05:34:33.887 --> 05:34:35.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

05:34:35.955 --> 05:34:37.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I GET THE THE REVENUE THEY NEED

05:34:37.957 --> 05:34:39.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE AND NOW

05:34:39.459 --> 05:34:40.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT THEY NEED TO JUSTIFY WHAT

05:34:40.927 --> 05:34:43.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT WHAT HOW DOES EXPENSES ARE

05:34:43.463 --> 05:34:45.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEN THERE ARE DEBATES UNIT OUT

05:34:45.365 --> 05:34:47.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT. DO OF WITH REGARD TO THE

05:34:47.300 --> 05:34:48.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INVESTMENTS THEY MAKE WITH

05:34:48.568 --> 05:34:50.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REGARD TO A BUILDING THERE AND

05:34:50.637 --> 05:34:51.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
WHAT THEY'RE TO

05:34:51.304 --> 05:34:53.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK OR

05:34:53.807 --> 05:34:55.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CABLE NETWORK OR WHATEVER.

05:34:55.542 --> 05:34:56.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'M JUST ONE COMMENTED ON THE

05:34:56.776 --> 05:34:57.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE ALL OF YOU

05:34:57.444 --> 05:34:58.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

05:34:58.945 --> 05:35:00.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M PREPARED AND I THINK THEIR

AUTHOR THAT BILL CHO AUTHOR THAT

05:35:03.750 --> 05:35:04.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BILL VOTE ON THAT BILL TODAY.

05:35:04.951 --> 05:35:07.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS

05:35:07.353 --> 05:35:08.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN

05:35:08.288 --> 05:35:09.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
YEARS AGO AND.

05:35:10.056 --> 05:35:11.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK WE NEED TO A FEW TO GET

WE NEED TO LOOK AT.

05:35:50.697 --> 05:35:52.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR STATE THAT LEVEL OF MANAGED

05:35:52.832 --> 05:35:55.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

GOVERNMENT AT THIS TIME WOULD

05:37:37.170 --> 05:37:38.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OPEN THE DOOR THAT WOULD HAVE

05:37:38.838 --> 05:37:40.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I MEAN

05:37:40.740 --> 05:37:42.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND I. AND I. AND I SAY THIS

05:37:42.809 --> 05:37:44.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOMEBODY WHO WORKING WITH MY

FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S.

05:37:51.317 --> 05:37:53.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU GO ABOUT TRYING TO OPEN UP

05:37:53.252 --> 05:37:53.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
COVER CALIFORNIA TO.

05:37:53.686 --> 05:37:55.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

05:37:55.355 --> 05:37:56.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO ALL CALIFORNIA'S REGARDLESS

05:37:56.556 --> 05:37:57.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IMMIGRATION STATUS BUT THAT YOU

05:37:58.057 --> 05:38:00.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KNOW I THINK IT WAS WISE TO HAVE

05:38:00.226 --> 05:38:01.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITHDRAWN. THROUGH THAT BECAUSE

05:38:01.894 --> 05:38:02.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO SET THE

05:38:02.562 --> 05:38:04.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PRECEDENCE OF WHAT WHAT THE

05:38:04.897 --> 05:38:05.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. COULD HAVE

05:38:05.965 --> 05:38:07.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
DONE WITH THAT

05:38:07.433 --> 05:38:09.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
SO. NOW. I'M I'M

05:38:09.669 --> 05:38:10.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT

05:38:10.770 --> 05:38:12.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE MAYBE VERSIONS OF A PUBLIC

05:38:12.472 --> 05:38:14.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OPTION OR VERSIONS OF IT ALL

05:38:14.207 --> 05:38:16.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE THAT WOULD

05:38:16.275 --> 05:38:18.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REQUIRE SOME FEDERALLY MERRILEES

05:38:18.478 --> 05:38:19.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE TO GET THEM AND I MISS. IT

05:38:19.278 --> 05:38:20.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DO IT BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE

05:38:20.213 --> 05:38:21.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
VERSIONS OF IT THAT DO NOT

05:38:21.881 --> 05:38:23.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REQUIRE IT AND THAT'S AND AND

05:38:23.616 --> 05:38:25.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING SO. IT'S

05:38:25.084 --> 05:38:26.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT ARE

05:38:26.152 --> 05:38:27.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROBABLY VERSIONS OF IT THAT ARE

05:38:27.854 --> 05:38:27.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
MORE.

05:38:28.054 --> 05:38:29.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MORE ROBUST BUT WE DO WE DO

05:38:29.889 --> 05:38:32.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WE SEE A PATH WHERE DOES

05:38:32.592 --> 05:38:33.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
NOT REQUIRED TO SORT OF.

05:38:34.394 --> 05:38:36.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE ROAD BLOCK OF THOSE OF

05:38:36.095 --> 05:38:36.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FEDERAL OF PERMISSIONS EITHER

05:38:36.963 --> 05:38:38.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ADMINISTRATIVE OR AN ACT OF

05:38:38.464 --> 05:38:40.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONGRESS CONTINENT JUST A FINAL.

05:38:40.767 --> 05:38:42.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
QUESTION ON TURN AROUND MY BRAIN

05:38:42.168 --> 05:38:44.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AROUND SO I THINK WE ALL HEARD A

05:38:44.137 --> 05:38:46.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FORMER VERMONT GOVERNOR SHUMLIN.

05:38:46.572 --> 05:38:47.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
TELL US AND WAS REALLY

05:38:47.540 --> 05:38:49.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INTERESTING TO HEAR FROM HIM

05:38:49.108 --> 05:38:50.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO

05:38:51.010 --> 05:38:52.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TACKLE COST CONTAINMENT FIRST.

05:38:53.046 --> 05:38:56.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I I I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE

05:38:56.649 --> 05:38:58.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT.

05:38:58.351 --> 05:39:00.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY

05:39:00.319 --> 05:39:01.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
FOR DECADES.

05:39:01.487 --> 05:39:03.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE'VE ALL BEEN TRIED TO COST.

05:39:03.589 --> 05:39:05.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND AND IT'S BEEN VERY VERY

05:39:05.158 --> 05:39:06.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DIFFICULT AND AND WE HAVE BEEN

05:39:06.592 --> 05:39:08.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT. AND I

05:39:08.594 --> 05:39:09.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
KNOW SOMEONE SAID WE SHOULD

05:39:09.829 --> 05:39:10.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUCK ACOSTA

05:39:10.997 --> 05:39:12.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR CONSIDERING SINGLE PAYER I'M

05:39:12.699 --> 05:39:13.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
NOT SURE IF THAT'S YOUR

05:39:13.466 --> 05:39:15.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERSPECTIVE BUT. IT SEEMS TO ME

05:39:15.401 --> 05:39:17.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT SINGLE PAYER HAS AN OBVIOUS

05:39:17.203 --> 05:39:17.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SOLUTION AND HOW YOU TO

05:39:17.704 --> 05:39:20.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
LOS.

05:39:20.473 --> 05:39:22.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
AND SO.

05:39:22.508 --> 05:39:24.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT

05:39:24.677 --> 05:39:26.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
VARIOUS COST CONTAINMENT EFFORTS

05:39:26.612 --> 05:39:27.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
AND HOW WE?

05:39:27.947 --> 05:39:30.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
PARALLEL TRACK.

05:39:30.249 --> 05:39:31.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOW WE THINK ABOUT SINGLE PAYER

05:39:31.217 --> 05:39:32.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VERSUS THINKING ABOUT TACKLING

05:39:32.618 --> 05:39:34.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COST CONTAINMENT IF IF IF WE'VE

05:39:34.587 --> 05:39:36.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEEN ALL? I MEAN AT THIS POINT

05:39:36.355 --> 05:39:37.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE CAN ALL AGREE ON PRINCIPLES

05:39:37.457 --> 05:39:38.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

05:39:38.391 --> 05:39:40.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
TACKLE COSTS.

05:39:40.426 --> 05:39:41.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR DECADES SO HOW HO SHOULD WE

05:39:41.694 --> 05:39:45.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THINK ABOUT THAT.

05:39:45.965 --> 05:39:48.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHILE OTHER BACK TO WHAT. I

05:39:48.067 --> 05:39:49.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOVERNOR SOMEONE SAID IN THE

05:39:49.102 --> 05:39:51.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEARING. AND IN WHAT I REMEMBER

05:39:51.337 --> 05:39:53.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HIM SAYING IS IS THAT.

05:39:53.272 --> 05:39:54.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HE WAS SAYING THAT EVEN IN A

05:39:54.907 --> 05:39:56.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM EVEN

05:39:56.876 --> 05:39:59.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. YOU

05:39:59.212 --> 05:40:00.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE STILL GONNA HAVE THE RISING

05:40:00.780 --> 05:40:02.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
PRICES.

05:40:02.782 --> 05:40:04.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE RISING PRICES OF HEALTH CARE

05:40:04.517 --> 05:40:06.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SERVICES YOU DEFINITELY GET.

05:40:06.986 --> 05:40:09.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UP HUGE ONE TIME AND ONGOING

05:40:09.722 --> 05:40:11.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SAVINGS FROM ELIMINATING

05:40:11.791 --> 05:40:13.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%

05:40:13.760 --> 05:40:14.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
GET RID OF THEM AND THE

05:40:14.961 --> 05:40:15.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
BUREAUCRACY AND THE

05:40:15.595 --> 05:40:16.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ADMINISTRATION.

05:40:16.796 --> 05:40:18.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

05:40:18.798 --> 05:40:20.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU STILL HAVE TO REIMBURSE AND

05:40:20.967 --> 05:40:22.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
PAY HOSPITALS DOCTORS.

05:40:22.969 --> 05:40:24.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
CAPTION DRUG COMPANIES.

05:40:25.004 --> 05:40:28.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A

05:40:28.074 --> 05:40:32.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EXPLICIT AFFECTED OF ROBUST.

05:40:32.078 --> 05:40:34.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COST CONTAINMENT ELEMENT THAT IS

05:40:34.213 --> 05:40:35.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PART OF ANY SINGLE PAYER

05:40:35.982 --> 05:40:36.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND

05:40:36.749 --> 05:40:37.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

05:40:37.950 --> 05:40:40.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAT HAS TO BE EXPLICIT.

05:40:40.386 --> 05:40:44.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO I THINK THAT SINCE THAT

05:40:44.123 --> 05:40:45.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS A REALLY DIFFICULT PIECE LIKE

05:40:45.825 --> 05:40:47.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU SAD WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING

05:40:47.193 --> 05:40:49.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WITH THIS FOR DECADES UPON

05:40:49.662 --> 05:40:50.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
DECADES.

05:40:50.129 --> 05:40:52.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

05:40:52.398 --> 05:40:53.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
GET THIS RIGHT.

05:40:53.800 --> 05:40:57.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND TAKE BOLD ACTION SO THAT

05:40:57.103 --> 05:41:00.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE ARE ABLE TO REDUCE THE COST

05:41:00.640 --> 05:41:01.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF HEALTHCARE AS WE MOVE TO A

05:41:02.041 --> 05:41:03.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WHICH

05:41:03.976 --> 05:41:06.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESULTS IN. HAVING TO PAY LAUGHS

05:41:06.145 --> 05:41:07.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
ON THE PUBLIC SIDE.

05:41:07.880 --> 05:41:08.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BECAUSE IT WE MOVED TO A

05:41:08.881 --> 05:41:12.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PUBLICLY FINANCED SYSTEM.

05:41:12.351 --> 05:41:13.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WORK THERE'S MONEY COMING FROM

05:41:14.053 --> 05:41:16.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMEWHERE SOMEONE PACE AND SO WE

05:41:16.088 --> 05:41:17.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS

05:41:17.390 --> 05:41:18.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT A REASONABLE AND SUSTAINABLE

05:41:19.058 --> 05:41:21.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
RATE.

05:41:21.093 --> 05:41:22.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT ISN'T ANY PART OF THE VISION

05:41:22.662 --> 05:41:23.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A SINGLE PAYER AND I'M AND I'M

05:41:23.563 --> 05:41:24.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRULY OBVIOUS EPONA SUPPORTER

05:41:24.897 --> 05:41:26.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SINGLE PAYER BUT I'M THE ONE TO

05:41:26.232 --> 05:41:27.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
HAVE A DIALOGUE.

05:41:27.900 --> 05:41:29.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PART OF THE COST SAVINGS IS FROM

05:41:29.268 --> 05:41:30.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE INSURANCE

05:41:30.336 --> 05:41:31.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INDUSTRY BUT PART OF THE COST

05:41:32.038 --> 05:41:33.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAVINGS COMES FROM. THE CLERK TO

05:41:33.773 --> 05:41:34.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PURCHASING POWER OF A SINGLE

05:41:34.607 --> 05:41:36.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
PAYER

05:41:36.342 --> 05:41:38.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND HOW THEY NEGOTIATE WITH

05:41:38.177 --> 05:41:40.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS.

05:41:40.246 --> 05:41:42.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND FORMA AND OTHER ACTORS IN

05:41:42.682 --> 05:41:44.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE SYSTEM SO HOW DO YOU IT HURT

05:41:45.051 --> 05:41:47.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
YOU MODEL THAT IF YOU.

05:41:47.720 --> 05:41:49.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY MODEL THAT

05:41:49.255 --> 05:41:51.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN AYE IN A IN A SEPARATE COST

05:41:51.791 --> 05:41:52.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONTAINMENT EFFORT THAT IS NOT

05:41:52.391 --> 05:41:54.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
TIED TO SEE.

05:41:54.193 --> 05:41:55.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
I'M.

05:41:55.962 --> 05:41:57.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I MEAN I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

05:41:57.196 --> 05:42:00.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RIGHT THAT THAT YOU KNOW. IT.

05:42:00.299 --> 05:42:01.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
S. AS SUPPORTERS A SINGLE PAYER

05:42:01.767 --> 05:42:03.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE THAT PART OF IT IS THE

05:42:03.903 --> 05:42:05.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
GETTING RID US OF.

05:42:05.771 --> 05:42:07.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DONE THE MIDDLE. DOES TO

05:42:07.840 --> 05:42:09.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAUCRACY

05:42:09.242 --> 05:42:10.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SIMPLIFYING THOSE TYPES OF

05:42:10.743 --> 05:42:13.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ISSUES BUT BUT STILL EVEN IF YOU

05:42:13.346 --> 05:42:15.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DO THAT YOU'RE STILL LIKE AGAIN

05:42:15.314 --> 05:42:16.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EIGHTY PERCENT OF OUR COSTS ARE

05:42:16.549 --> 05:42:18.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOCTORS HOSPITALS DRUG COMPANIES

05:42:18.417 --> 05:42:20.553 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
EXIT <u>&lt;c.green&gt; IF THE PLUS OF</u>
<u>EACH&lt;/c&gt;</u>

05:42:20.620 --> 05:42:22.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARM. POLY NINETY EIGHTY WERE

05:42:22.488 --> 05:42:23.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTY TO NINETY

05:42:23.122 --> 05:42:25.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PERCENT OF SO THE QUESTION IS

05:42:25.291 --> 05:42:25.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THIS UNIT PRICE ISSUE.

05:42:25.958 --> 05:42:27.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
AND AGAIN I THINK.

05:42:27.827 --> 05:42:29.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THOUGH THE WAY THAT IT THAT THIS

05:42:29.462 --> 05:42:31.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COUNTRY HAS HAS TRIED IS IS

05:42:31.297 --> 05:42:33.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THROUGH COMPETITION BUT THERE IS

05:42:33.332 --> 05:42:35.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
OF IT ALLY AND.

05:42:35.401 --> 05:42:35.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE THREE WAYS THAT YOU TRY TO

05:42:36.035 --> 05:42:37.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DO IT THIS IS COMPETITION

05:42:37.169 --> 05:42:41.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NEGOTIATION OR OF REGULATION. BY

05:42:41.207 --> 05:42:42.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE THAT COMPETITION IS NOT WORK

05:42:42.909 --> 05:42:44.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PARTICULARLY WELL BECAUSE

05:42:44.176 --> 05:42:46.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

05:42:46.412 --> 05:42:47.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONSUMERS PURCHASERS WHETHER

05:42:47.914 --> 05:42:49.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY BE BUSINESS OR LABOR DON'T

05:42:49.682 --> 05:42:51.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY NO.

05:42:51.217 --> 05:42:53.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RIGHT IF YOU HEALTH CARE YOU

05:42:53.185 --> 05:42:55.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU'RE JUST NOT AND IF IT DID I

05:42:55.855 --> 05:42:57.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU'RE NOT IN THE SPACE TO DO

05:42:57.323 --> 05:42:57.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT AND CUTS AND CLASSIC MORE

05:42:57.924 --> 05:42:58.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
HOUSE.

05:42:58.591 --> 05:43:02.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
RIGHT EXACTLY AND IF IT IS NOT
A.

05:43:03.029 --> 05:43:04.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AND IT'S ALSO SUCH A

05:43:04.397 --> 05:43:07.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONSOLIDATED FEEL THAT THAT ARE

05:43:07.500 --> 05:43:09.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE ARE MORTGAGE. IT AT AT

05:43:09.468 --> 05:43:11.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
BEST MARKET FAILURES

05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:13.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SO THEN THE QUESTION IS.

05:43:13.205 --> 05:43:15.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT OTHER MECHANISM DO YOU USE

05:43:15.374 --> 05:43:16.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT AND

05:43:17.009 --> 05:43:19.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REVIEW VIEW OF OVER PRICES AND?

05:43:19.445 --> 05:43:21.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

05:43:21.247 --> 05:43:23.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE AND WHETHER IT'S IN A SINGLE

05:43:23.516 --> 05:43:24.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOW IN THE IN OTHER COUNTRIES

05:43:24.784 --> 05:43:25.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHETHER IT'S A SINGLE PAYER

05:43:25.952 --> 05:43:28.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SYSTEM OR A MULTI OF THE PAYERS

05:43:28.120 --> 05:43:29.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SYSTEM. THEY USE EITHER THOUGH

05:43:30.056 --> 05:43:31.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE

05:43:31.357 --> 05:43:32.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOVERNMENT OR THE REGULAR TO.

05:43:32.692 --> 05:43:34.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TORY PARA THE GOVERNMENT TO DO

05:43:34.460 --> 05:43:35.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO PUT TO PROVIDE THAT OVERSIGHT

05:43:36.062 --> 05:43:38.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND TO THEN AND THE COURT THE

05:43:38.197 --> 05:43:40.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
QUESTION IS CAN WE BILL THAT.

05:43:40.366 --> 05:43:43.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MECHANISM EVEN ABSENT SOME OF

05:43:43.135 --> 05:43:44.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE OTHER COMPONENTS AS A AS A

05:43:45.004 --> 05:43:46.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
STEP ESTEPONA AS LIKE THE

05:43:46.639 --> 05:43:47.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU WOULD

05:43:47.440 --> 05:43:50.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
NEED FOR THE FOR. AYE BUT

05:43:50.242 --> 05:43:51.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OVERALL SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THAT

05:43:51.377 --> 05:43:51.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THAT'S WHERE.

05:43:52.044 --> 05:43:54.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
JUST LEGISLATURE OTHER OR

05:43:54.513 --> 05:43:56.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FUTURE LEGISLATORS DECIDE TO GO

05:43:56.415 --> 05:43:57.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

05:43:57.083 --> 05:43:58.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I MEAN AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT

05:43:58.951 --> 05:44:00.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FRANKLY NEEDS TO BE FLESHED OUT

05:44:00.586 --> 05:44:01.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN THE FIVE SIX TWO PROPOSALS

05:44:01.587 --> 05:44:02.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TERRACE AS YOU KNOW WE SUPPORT

05:44:03.022 --> 05:44:04.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FIVE SIX TWO WE PUT ON OUR

05:44:04.757 --> 05:44:06.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCORECARD. ON BUT IS ONE OF THE

05:44:06.492 --> 05:44:08.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD WAS ARMED

05:44:08.361 --> 05:44:09.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT IT BUILDS THIS GREAT

05:44:09.729 --> 05:44:11.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PURCHASING POOL OF FORTY MILLION

05:44:11.797 --> 05:44:13.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CALIFORNIANS. BUT THERE'S NOT

05:44:13.799 --> 05:44:15.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NECESSARILY THE ID SPELLED OUT

05:44:15.634 --> 05:44:17.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE EXACT MECHANISM OF HOW.

05:44:17.169 --> 05:44:18.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT WOULD NEGOTIATE WITH THE

05:44:18.971 --> 05:44:20.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DRUG COMPANIES IF YOU DON'T

05:44:20.239 --> 05:44:21.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NECESSARILY HAVE A FORMULARY AND

05:44:21.474 --> 05:44:22.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I AND I KNOW THERE WAS SOME

05:44:22.541 --> 05:44:23.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DISCUSSION THE EARLIER PANEL

05:44:23.309 --> 05:44:24.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ABOUT.

05:44:24.110 --> 05:44:28.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS ENVISIONED ARE NOT HER OI

05:44:28.147 --> 05:44:30.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EATS IT'S NOT SPELLED OUT AGAIN.

05:44:30.883 --> 05:44:33.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISPENSERS ARE CLEAR THAT THEY

05:44:33.552 --> 05:44:34.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
DID

05:44:34.787 --> 05:44:35.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DILLON DID NOT GO INTO A CERTAIN

05:44:35.855 --> 05:44:36.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LEVEL OF DETAIL WITH AND THAT'S

05:44:36.522 --> 05:44:37.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHERE THE DETAILS ARE ABOUT HOW

05:44:56.175 --> 05:44:57.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A MECHANISM ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

05:44:57.610 --> 05:44:59.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
WE'RE SUGGESTING.

05:44:59.345 --> 05:45:01.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I DID YEAH THAT WE SHOULD MOVE

REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO.

05:45:06.786 --> 05:45:08.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

05:45:08.354 --> 05:45:10.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
NUMBER ONE.

05:45:10.156 --> 05:45:11.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FINAL QUESTION WHAT DO YOU ALL

05:45:11.791 --> 05:45:12.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK ABOUT CHINA BRING BACK AN

05:45:12.425 --> 05:45:13.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
INDIVIDUAL MAN

05:45:13.893 --> 05:45:14.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO CALIFORNIA I NOTICED THAT WAS

05:45:14.994 --> 05:45:16.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
NOT.

05:45:16.462 --> 05:45:18.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MENTION IN ANY THE PROPOSAL'S

05:45:18.297 --> 05:45:21.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO FARMS. SO I I'M ACTUALLY I

YEAH AND ITALY TO I MEAN

05:45:23.769 --> 05:45:26.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT WE'VE

05:45:26.338 --> 05:45:27.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
SEEN AT THAT.

05:45:27.406 --> 05:45:29.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MARKETS ARE MOST STABLE AND COST

05:45:29.542 --> 05:45:31.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SPREAD OUT ARE. MINIMIZED

05:45:31.644 --> 05:45:32.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THEY'LL COST INCREASE OR

05:45:32.745 --> 05:45:33.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MINIMIZE THE MOST WE HAVE MORE

05:45:33.979 --> 05:45:35.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM.

05:45:35.181 --> 05:45:38.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SO I'VE WHATEVER LEGAL.

05:45:38.350 --> 05:45:41.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAIT THEY CAN BE DONE TO ENSURE

05:45:41.087 --> 05:45:42.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT YOU'RE GETTING EVERYONE IN

05:45:42.221 --> 05:45:43.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE SYSTEM WE ALL KNOW A MANDATE

05:45:43.656 --> 05:45:44.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
A PENALTY DOESN'T SURE

05:45:44.523 --> 05:45:46.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EVERYBODY'S IN THE SYSTEM.

05:45:46.325 --> 05:45:48.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVEN THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BUT.

05:45:48.661 --> 05:45:50.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
YOU KNOW THERE'S NO.

05:45:50.429 --> 05:45:51.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT IS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL IN THE

05:45:51.897 --> 05:45:53.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ARSENAL. AND.

05:45:53.466 --> 05:45:54.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO WAIT TO

05:45:55.000 --> 05:45:56.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SEE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

05:45:56.535 --> 05:45:57.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NATIONWIDE WITH A MANDATE BEING

05:45:57.603 --> 05:45:58.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
PULLED BACK.

05:45:58.571 --> 05:46:00.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT ABSOLUTELY IT TO THE EXTENT

05:46:00.773 --> 05:46:01.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THAT THAT.

05:46:01.373 --> 05:46:02.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT REQUIREMENT CAN BE IN

05:46:02.908 --> 05:46:04.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PLACE AND CAN HAVE SOME IMPACT

05:46:04.543 --> 05:46:04.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ON PEOPLE JOINING THE

05:46:05.010 --> 05:46:06.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEMATICALLY YOUNGER HEALTHIER

05:46:06.512 --> 05:46:08.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PEOPLE BUT WE THINK THAT HELPS

05:46:08.547 --> 05:46:09.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BRING DOWN COSTS STABILIZE

05:46:09.081 --> 05:46:09.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
MARKETS.

05:46:09.982 --> 05:46:11.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AND IN HEALTHAXIS AND

05:46:11.984 --> 05:46:14.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I WOULD I WOULD I AS A SUDDEN IN

05:46:14.620 --> 05:46:16.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MY PRESENTATION THAT HAPPY TO

05:46:16.288 --> 05:46:18.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REPEAT THE. I THINK WE THINK

05:46:18.557 --> 05:46:19.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THE AND NUMBER ONE DRIVER

05:46:20.025 --> 05:46:20.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
OF.

05:46:20.726 --> 05:46:22.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
ENROLLMENT

05:46:22.461 --> 05:46:24.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAS BEEN THE SUBSIDIES NOT A

05:46:24.730 --> 05:46:26.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PENALTY THAT THAT HAS BEEN WHAT

05:46:26.232 --> 05:46:27.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING PEOPLE

05:46:27.833 --> 05:46:29.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO GET CITED CITY IT'S THE IT'S

05:46:29.735 --> 05:46:31.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE PARENTS NOT TO STICKS.

05:46:31.070 --> 05:46:33.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND SO WE DO THINK THAT.

05:46:33.272 --> 05:46:34.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE TO STABILIZE THE MARKETS

05:46:34.607 --> 05:46:35.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE IMPACTS

05:46:35.975 --> 05:46:37.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF THE REPEAL OF THE MANDATE

05:46:37.376 --> 05:46:38.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHICH THE CBO SCORED AT A TECH

05:46:38.744 --> 05:46:39.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW IT EIGHT TO TEN PERCENT

05:46:40.045 --> 05:46:42.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INCREASE IN PREMIUMS. WHICH ARE

05:46:42.348 --> 05:46:43.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
UC BERKELEY ESTIMATED WOULD

05:46:43.849 --> 05:46:46.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LEAVE ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN.

WROTE OVER ARE LOSING COVERAGE.

05:46:52.258 --> 05:46:54.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND THE IMPACTS OF THAT

05:46:54.393 --> 05:46:55.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INCLUDING FOLKS WHO MAIN WHO MAY

05:46:55.995 --> 05:46:57.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

WHO ARE NOT PAYING INTO THE

05:47:12.011 --> 05:47:13.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SYSTEM. THAT WOULD BE

05:47:13.245 --> 05:47:13.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
APPROPRIATE IF WE THINK THAT

05:47:13.979 --> 05:47:15.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT CALIFORNIA COULD COULDN'T

05:47:15.814 --> 05:47:16.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SHOULD DESIGNED ONE THAT'S MAYBE

05:47:17.016 --> 05:47:18.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN WHAT THE

05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:19.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

05:47:19.652 --> 05:47:23.255 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
PROPOSED. WE ALSO THINK THAT
THE.

05:47:23.322 --> 05:47:25.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE MECHANISM OF HAVING.

05:47:25.391 --> 05:47:26.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
JUST THE PROMPT.

AT TAX TIME IS JUST A HELPFUL

05:47:30.462 --> 05:47:32.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ENCOURAGEMENT TO REMIND PEOPLE

05:47:32.198 --> 05:47:33.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO TO GET COVERED SO THEY DON'T

05:47:33.966 --> 05:47:35.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEY ARE NOT IN A SITUATION

05:47:35.334 --> 05:47:37.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHERE THEY FIND THEMSELVES.

05:47:37.136 --> 05:47:39.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AS THE COVER CAL COUPLING A

05:47:39.104 --> 05:47:40.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMERCIAL HAD YOU KNOW ON THE

THAT I DIED THERE ARE IT IT IS

05:47:50.983 --> 05:47:52.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE'S INTO USEFUL KNOWLEDGE TO

05:47:53.018 --> 05:47:54.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GET FOLKS THERE BUT I THINK THE

05:47:54.620 --> 05:47:56.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE PRIMARY FOCUS SHOULD BE ON

05:47:56.155 --> 05:47:56.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AFFORDABILITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE

05:47:56.789 --> 05:47:59.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
WERE KIND OF.

05:47:59.558 --> 05:48:01.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'M JUST ONE FINAL COMMENT WHICH

05:48:01.527 --> 05:48:02.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IS I FEAR MUCH APPRECIATE.

YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND AND I'VE

05:48:05.531 --> 05:48:06.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAD MEETINGS I THINK WITH ALMOST

TO TALK THROUGH. UP OPTIONS.

05:48:10.569 --> 05:48:13.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK FOR US WE'RE ALL STILL

05:48:13.138 --> 05:48:14.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOKING FOR THAT NEXT LEVEL OF

05:48:14.907 --> 05:48:17.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SPECIFICITY AROUND PROPOSALS.

05:48:17.142 --> 05:48:19.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARM AND AND I KNOW THERE BEEN A

05:48:19.211 --> 05:48:19.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
LOT OF.

05:48:20.012 --> 05:48:21.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE BEEN A LOT OF SHOTS TAKEN

05:48:21.780 --> 05:48:23.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT AT THAT FOR SIXTY TWO FOR

05:48:23.682 --> 05:48:25.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOME LEVELS OF ON SPECIFICITY

05:48:25.517 --> 05:48:26.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT I WOULD SAY IN THE OTHER

05:48:26.585 --> 05:48:28.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAND. WE'RE ALSO JUST WAITING

05:48:28.454 --> 05:48:29.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR OTHER IDEAS AND IF WE AND IN

05:48:29.722 --> 05:48:31.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE ABSENCE OF IDEAS WE HAVE

05:48:31.624 --> 05:48:33.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMETHING HERE THAT THAT WE'RE

05:48:33.125 --> 05:48:34.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
CONSIDERING.

05:48:34.526 --> 05:48:36.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

COMES UP AGAINST THE FORMULARY.

05:49:40.959 --> 05:49:44.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REMAIN A PROBLEM ONGOING IF WE

05:49:44.763 --> 05:49:46.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MOVE TO ANOTHER SYSTEM.

05:49:46.465 --> 05:49:49.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
REASONING BECAUSE.

05:49:49.668 --> 05:49:51.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN I BELIEVE THE DOCTORS SHOULD

05:49:51.837 --> 05:49:52.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ACTUALLY HAVE THE SAME WHAT

05:49:52.838 --> 05:49:53.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TREATMENT THE PATIENTS GET BUT

05:49:54.006 --> 05:49:55.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALL THAT'S KIND OF UNHEARD OF IN

05:49:55.841 --> 05:49:57.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THE CURRENT SYSTEM.

05:49:57.676 --> 05:49:58.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WILL BE UNHEARD OF IN A NEW

05:49:58.911 --> 05:50:00.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SYSTEM I MEAN HOW DO ENVISIONED

05:50:00.779 --> 05:50:02.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT BECAUSE COST CONTROL IS AN

05:50:02.581 --> 05:50:03.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%

INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

05:50:20.332 --> 05:50:21.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE

05:50:21.867 --> 05:50:23.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PATIENTS A CORRECTION MAYBE GO

05:50:23.535 --> 05:50:25.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BACK TO WORK NOT HAVE TO HAVE A

05:50:25.270 --> 05:50:26.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TRANSPLANT OR SOMETHING LIKE

05:50:26.438 --> 05:50:28.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT. I MEAN WHERE WILL THIS NEW

05:50:28.741 --> 05:50:31.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SYSTEM FALL AND MAYBE IN THOSE

05:50:31.577 --> 05:50:32.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUSINESSES CHOOSE SAY WE WOULD

05:50:32.611 --> 05:50:34.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NEED SPECIFICITY BECAUSE WHEN IT

05:50:34.880 --> 05:50:37.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMES DOWN TO BRASS TACKS THAT'S

05:50:37.549 --> 05:50:38.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE YOUR

05:50:38.117 --> 05:50:38.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
DECISIONS.

05:50:38.984 --> 05:50:40.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IF WE JUST HAVE THE SAME KIND

05:50:40.686 --> 05:50:41.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF SYSTEM WE HAVE NOW THAT WE

05:50:42.020 --> 05:50:47.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF ACCESS.

05:50:47.359 --> 05:50:50.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

05:50:50.462 --> 05:50:52.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK IN

05:50:52.264 --> 05:50:54.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
TERMS OF.

05:50:54.867 --> 05:50:56.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A BALANCE

05:50:56.201 --> 05:50:58.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BETWEEN HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE YOU

05:50:58.437 --> 05:50:58.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVE THE BROADEST MAD ABOUT

05:50:59.004 --> 05:51:00.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ACCESS

05:51:00.339 --> 05:51:01.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
A CARE THAT IS.

05:51:01.540 --> 05:51:03.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE MY

05:51:03.475 --> 05:51:04.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

OPERATE YOU KNOW FOR EACH MO

05:51:09.581 --> 05:51:10.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS OVER A

05:51:10.949 --> 05:51:11.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DECADE AGO TO MAKE SURE THAT

05:51:11.917 --> 05:51:13.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PEOPLE ARE NOT TONIGHT MEDICALLY

05:51:13.852 --> 05:51:14.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NECESSARY CHAIR THAT DATA ABOUT

05:51:15.053 --> 05:51:16.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW

05:51:16.555 --> 05:51:16.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
TO.

05:51:16.722 --> 05:51:18.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
EARLIER WAS.

05:51:18.924 --> 05:51:21.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WAS THE RESULT OF SOME OF THE

05:51:21.460 --> 05:51:22.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WORK THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE DONE

05:51:23.061 --> 05:51:24.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND CONTINUE TO DO TO MAKE SURE

05:51:24.530 --> 05:51:25.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE PEOPLE ARE NOT DENIED FROM

05:51:25.664 --> 05:51:27.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE.

05:51:27.466 --> 05:51:28.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THERE THAT THERE WAS AN

05:51:28.434 --> 05:51:29.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW

05:51:29.568 --> 05:51:30.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROCESS SO THAT PEOPLE IT.

05:51:31.003 --> 05:51:32.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DOT DOES ENSURE CHINA'S

05:51:32.604 --> 05:51:33.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMPANIES ARE OVERTURNED WHEN

05:51:33.705 --> 05:51:35.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
THEY ARE DONE. DENYING THAT
CARE.

05:51:35.874 --> 05:51:37.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT TO SAY THAT THE PROBLEM IS

05:51:37.543 --> 05:51:39.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ENTIRELY SOLVE BUT THAT THAT

05:51:39.111 --> 05:51:40.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP

05:51:40.379 --> 05:51:41.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOR PEOPLE TO GET THE JUSTICE

05:51:41.780 --> 05:51:42.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THEY NEED.

05:51:42.714 --> 05:51:44.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THE CARE THAT THEY NEED I

05:51:44.550 --> 05:51:46.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THINK IN TERMS OF AYE AND

05:51:46.552 --> 05:51:48.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHETHER IT IS WITH MARTIN

05:51:48.086 --> 05:51:50.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NETWORKS WHETHER YOU WHETHER

05:51:50.856 --> 05:51:52.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT'S REGARD TO FORMULARIES I

05:51:52.458 --> 05:51:54.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK THAT'S ALWAYS THE BALANCE

05:51:54.827 --> 05:51:58.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I DO. THINK ARE THERE IS ALWAYS

05:51:58.664 --> 05:52:00.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A BALANCE BETWEEN THAT AND IN

05:52:00.299 --> 05:52:02.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE IN THE REALM OF COST CONTROL

05:52:02.267 --> 05:52:04.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE WE ALSO AS A CONSUMER

05:52:04.570 --> 05:52:07.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
ADVOCATE I ALSO.

05:52:07.306 --> 05:52:08.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

05:52:08.173 --> 05:52:09.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO HAVE.

05:52:09.374 --> 05:52:10.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO COULD

05:52:10.709 --> 05:52:11.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO BARGAIN FOR THE BEST PRICE

05:52:11.677 --> 05:52:12.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND FOR THE BEST QUALITY. THAT

05:52:12.678 --> 05:52:14.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IF THERE IS A PROVIDER OR A

05:52:14.279 --> 05:52:14.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOSPITAL OR WHATEVER THAT IS

05:52:14.847 --> 05:52:15.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROVIDING PARTICULARLY POOR

05:52:15.447 --> 05:52:16.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
QUALITY THAT THERE IS A MECCA IT

05:52:17.015 --> 05:52:18.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
OF OUR OR.

05:52:18.183 --> 05:52:19.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OR LOW QUALITY HIGH COST

05:52:19.985 --> 05:52:21.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CARE THAT THERE IS A MECHANISM

05:52:21.286 --> 05:52:23.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
TO STE

05:52:23.155 --> 05:52:25.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STEER OF. PATIENTS AWAY FROM

05:52:25.257 --> 05:52:26.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT IN

05:52:26.492 --> 05:52:27.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
ANYBODY'S INTEREST.

05:52:27.726 --> 05:52:29.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INCLUDING THE PATIENTS UPDATE

05:52:30.062 --> 05:52:31.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IF THERE IS THAT CASE AND SO.

05:52:31.997 --> 05:52:32.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT I THINK THAT THERE IS A ROW

05:52:32.664 --> 05:52:33.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF ONLY A ROLE FOR THOSE

05:52:33.832 --> 05:52:35.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MECHANISMS AND THAT'S SOMETHING

05:52:35.300 --> 05:52:36.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT. NEEDS THAT ARE HE'S

05:52:37.002 --> 05:52:38.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REPLACED OUT IT SHOULDN'T BE

05:52:38.337 --> 05:52:39.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DRIVEN BY PROFIT IT SHOULDN'T BE

05:52:39.404 --> 05:52:42.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DID I DROVE DRIVEN BY THE. OF BY

05:52:42.574 --> 05:52:43.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE NEEDS OF ENSURE YOUNG

05:52:44.009 --> 05:52:45.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADVENTURERS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

05:52:45.844 --> 05:52:47.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT SHOULD BE IN A YOU KNOW POKE

05:52:47.145 --> 05:52:48.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PUBLIC IN OPEN PROCESS SEIZE AND

05:52:49.047 --> 05:52:49.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S WHAT ONE OF THE REASONS

05:52:49.915 --> 05:52:51.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHY. WE WE WOULD LIKE A WELL

05:52:51.617 --> 05:52:53.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DESIGNED SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM

05:52:53.318 --> 05:52:55.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE BUT.

05:52:55.254 --> 05:52:57.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

05:52:57.189 --> 05:53:00.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE

05:53:00.192 --> 05:53:01.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
MINDFUL AS WE ARE.

05:53:01.827 --> 05:53:02.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TAKE A STEPS FOR COST CONTROL

05:53:02.661 --> 05:53:03.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT WE DON'T. AT THE END OF THE

05:53:03.762 --> 05:53:04.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DAY WE DON'T THINK THAT THE

05:53:04.530 --> 05:53:06.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ISSUE OF COST.

05:53:06.331 --> 05:53:07.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SHOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON QUALITY

05:53:07.966 --> 05:53:10.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE ACCESS AGAIN IT IT'S THIS

05:53:10.068 --> 05:53:10.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNIT IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE USED

05:53:10.669 --> 05:53:11.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
HIM.

05:53:11.703 --> 05:53:13.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE USE TOO MUCH

05:53:13.438 --> 05:53:14.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
HEALTH CARE AND.

05:53:14.339 --> 05:53:16.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S IT'S BECAUSE OF THE PRICE

05:53:16.842 --> 05:53:18.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO THE MORE WE HAD ADDRESS

05:53:18.277 --> 05:53:20.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUST WHY THAT UNIT PRICES SO

05:53:20.178 --> 05:53:21.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HIGH A WHITE GOES UP AT IN THIS

05:53:21.914 --> 05:53:23.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IS UNSUSTAINABLE RATE.

05:53:23.715 --> 05:53:26.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I I DID THAT'S THE THAT'S THE

05:53:26.251 --> 05:53:28.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO GET TO AND

05:53:28.487 --> 05:53:30.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT WE SHOULD GET TO AND

05:53:30.289 --> 05:53:31.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
IMMEDIATELY.

05:53:32.157 --> 05:53:33.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH

05:53:33.859 --> 05:53:34.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

05:53:34.259 --> 05:53:35.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EVEN DESPITE SOME THE OTHER

05:53:35.894 --> 05:53:38.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
OBSTACLES THAT EXIST.

05:53:38.163 --> 05:53:39.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I'M WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

05:53:39.831 --> 05:53:41.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MARYLAND'S A LITTLE BIT AND I

05:53:41.567 --> 05:53:42.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAD PULLED MY NOTES FROM THE

05:53:43.035 --> 05:53:44.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PREVIOUS HEARINGS ALL WE HAD

05:53:44.336 --> 05:53:46.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MARILYN AND THE COST CONTROL WAS

05:53:46.638 --> 05:53:48.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THE TOPIC.

05:53:48.106 --> 05:53:49.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND YOU KNOW I FULLY AGREE IF

05:53:49.808 --> 05:53:51.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ANYTHING THAT WE MOVE FORWARD

05:53:51.076 --> 05:53:52.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH WE HAVE TO GET A HANDLE ON

05:53:52.778 --> 05:53:53.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE COST BEFORE WE JUST CARRY

05:53:53.545 --> 05:53:54.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THE BAGGAGE.

05:53:55.047 --> 05:53:56.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW WITH US TO OF ANY OTHER

05:53:56.415 --> 05:53:58.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SYSTEM.ONE OF THE THINGS

05:53:58.150 --> 05:54:00.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MARILYN DID AND YOU KNOW TRYING

05:54:00.352 --> 05:54:02.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO. REFILL MY OWN NOTES HERE.

05:54:02.588 --> 05:54:04.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
WAS.

05:54:04.122 --> 05:54:05.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY COMBINE YOU KNOW WHEN THEY

05:54:05.624 --> 05:54:06.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LOOK AT PRICE THEY LOOK AT

05:54:06.959 --> 05:54:09.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UTILIZATION ALSO SO THAT KIND OF

05:54:09.861 --> 05:54:10.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CONTROLLING ON BOTH ENDS.

05:54:10.762 --> 05:54:12.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

05:54:12.698 --> 05:54:14.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ON

05:54:14.466 --> 05:54:16.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PART OF IT BECAUSE THEY SAID

05:54:16.068 --> 05:54:17.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INSTEAD OF INCREASEDLIKE HOW IT

05:54:17.836 --> 05:54:19.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS CURRENTLY THE MORE PEOPLE

05:54:19.137 --> 05:54:20.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT COME IN THE MORE MONEY

05:54:20.906 --> 05:54:22.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT'S MADE BECAUSE YOU HAVE

05:54:22.074 --> 05:54:23.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MORE PEOPLE GO THROUGH THE

05:54:23.308 --> 05:54:24.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SYSTEM MORE PEOPLE PAYING.

05:54:24.943 --> 05:54:26.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT SO INSTEAD OF INCREASING

05:54:26.678 --> 05:54:28.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UTILIZATION RATES TO MAKE MORE

05:54:28.513 --> 05:54:30.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MONEY THE PROGRAM WILL SIMPLY

05:54:30.716 --> 05:54:32.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCREASE THEIR BUDGET BY GREAT

05:54:32.551 --> 05:54:34.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF GROWTH EVERY YEAR. ON THE IS

05:54:34.419 --> 05:54:36.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AN EXAMPLE OF SIZE TWO PERCENT

05:54:36.588 --> 05:54:38.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU HAVE THERE BEEN SO MANY MORE

05:54:38.357 --> 05:54:40.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PEOPLE IT'S INCREASE OF BODIES

05:54:40.225 --> 05:54:41.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THIS AMOUNT.

05:54:41.259 --> 05:54:42.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY

05:54:42.761 --> 05:54:44.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PEOPLE HAVE SEEN SO IT'S NOT

05:54:44.363 --> 05:54:46.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BASED ON THE UTILIZATION IS JUST

05:54:46.164 --> 05:54:48.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
MONEY CAPPED.

05:54:48.266 --> 05:54:50.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND IT'S AN EFFORT TO REDUCE

05:54:50.302 --> 05:54:52.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOSPITALIZATION MISTAKES THEY'RE

05:54:52.204 --> 05:54:54.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SAYING READMISSIONS INFECTIONS

05:54:54.873 --> 05:54:56.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SPREAD AT CENTER BECAUSE THE

05:54:56.141 --> 05:54:58.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUDGET CAP BUT. MY CONCERN IS.

05:54:58.810 --> 05:55:00.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING CARE.

05:55:00.278 --> 05:55:01.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THIS

05:55:01.847 --> 05:55:03.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU CAN ONLY SQUEEZE SO MANY

05:55:03.649 --> 05:55:05.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PEOPLE IN THE ON THE BUDGET.

05:55:05.684 --> 05:55:06.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M ONE OF THE THINGS I TALKED

05:55:06.518 --> 05:55:08.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ABOUT WAS IF.

05:55:08.387 --> 05:55:10.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY EXCEEDING

05:55:11.023 --> 05:55:11.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THEY HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES

05:55:11.790 --> 05:55:14.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND METALLICA WAY TO LOWER AND

05:55:14.226 --> 05:55:15.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW. PEOPLE GETTING KILLED

05:55:15.727 --> 05:55:16.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFECTION

05:55:16.995 --> 05:55:18.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RATES THERE'S A BONUS AIDED.

05:55:18.430 --> 05:55:20.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
AS AN ENSIGN OF.

05:55:20.399 --> 05:55:21.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW AND THEN THE OTHER

05:55:21.933 --> 05:55:23.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SIDE OF THE COIN IS IF MORTALITY

05:55:23.869 --> 05:55:25.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RATES ARE HIGH OR THEY'RE NOT

05:55:25.470 --> 05:55:26.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TAKING CARE PEOPLE OR THEY HAVE

05:55:26.972 --> 05:55:28.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MORE HOSPITAL READMISSIONS.

05:55:28.540 --> 05:55:31.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WOULD THERE BE CUTS OF FINES.

05:55:31.410 --> 05:55:33.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO INCENTIVIZE STAYING WITHIN

05:55:33.245 --> 05:55:35.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE CAP I. I'M JUST GOING THAT

05:55:35.580 --> 05:55:37.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OUT THERE BECAUSE THAT IS.

05:55:37.849 --> 05:55:39.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT MARILYN

05:55:39.418 --> 05:55:39.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE COSTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT

05:55:40.018 --> 05:55:49.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
OF.

05:55:49.394 --> 05:55:51.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR THEM I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON

05:55:51.329 --> 05:55:52.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MARYLAND I ALMOST FEEL LIKE THE

05:55:52.531 --> 05:55:54.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NEXT HEARING SHOULD MAYBE BE IN

05:55:54.199 --> 05:55:55.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
MARYLAND.

05:55:55.133 --> 05:55:56.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

05:55:56.935 --> 05:55:59.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF.

05:56:00.005 --> 05:56:02.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHY MARYLAND HAD A KIND OF TWO

05:56:02.441 --> 05:56:05.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POINT KNOW? THAT SYSTEM WHY THEY

05:56:05.610 --> 05:56:08.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WANTED TO ADD THE. BUDGET CAP

05:56:08.313 --> 05:56:09.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WAS THAT WOULD IS KINDA GOING

05:56:09.581 --> 05:56:11.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BACK TO THE BALLOON ANALOGY THAT

05:56:11.416 --> 05:56:12.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I USE THEY WERE JUST LOOKING

05:56:12.951 --> 05:56:15.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEIR SYSTEM WAS ALL PAYER RATE

05:56:15.353 --> 05:56:17.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SETTING. BUT IT WAS ONLY LOOKING

05:56:17.389 --> 05:56:18.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
AT HOSPITALS.

05:56:18.690 --> 05:56:20.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND ONLY LOOKING AT PRICES AND

05:56:20.926 --> 05:56:23.729 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
SO THEY WERE SQUEEZING ON
PRICES.

05:56:23.795 --> 05:56:26.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN HOSPITALS AND THEN OVER TIME

05:56:26.364 --> 05:56:27.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SINCE THE SEVENTIES THERE'D BEEN

05:56:27.566 --> 05:56:28.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A COUPLE JUST SHIFTS IN THE

05:56:28.967 --> 05:56:30.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MARKET THERE WAS MORE. CARE

05:56:30.702 --> 05:56:32.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MOVING TO OUTPATIENT SETTINGS

05:56:32.738 --> 05:56:34.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY PRICE

05:56:34.573 --> 05:56:35.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
CONTROLS ON IT.

05:56:35.640 --> 05:56:39.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND MARYLAND. HAD AN OVERALL

05:56:39.478 --> 05:56:41.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INCREASE I'VE BY AS I UNDERSTAND

05:56:41.880 --> 05:56:43.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT IN HEALTH CARE SPENDING

05:56:43.715 --> 05:56:44.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH

05:56:44.850 --> 05:56:46.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UTILIZATION THE IT REALLY HIGHER

05:56:47.052 --> 05:56:49.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RATES OF RE ADMISSIONS AND

05:56:49.287 --> 05:56:51.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOSPITAL. ACQUIRED INFECTION.

05:56:51.723 --> 05:56:53.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO. THERE WASN'T MAYBE THE

05:56:53.859 --> 05:56:55.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
QUALITY AND THAT SHOULD HAVE

05:56:55.827 --> 05:56:57.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BEEN OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW EVEN

05:56:57.162 --> 05:56:58.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IF YOU HAVE VERY HIGH

05:56:58.296 --> 05:57:00.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UTILIZATION BUT. POOR QUALITY

05:57:00.899 --> 05:57:01.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE GREAT

05:57:01.900 --> 05:57:03.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
HEALTH OUTCOMES

05:57:03.335 --> 05:57:04.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND SO I THINK WHAT THEY WERE

05:57:04.269 --> 05:57:07.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRYING TO DO WAS A LITTLE BIT OF

05:57:07.239 --> 05:57:08.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT SOMETIMES ADVOCATES CALL

05:57:08.707 --> 05:57:10.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE TRIPLER THE QUADRUPLE AIM.

05:57:10.175 --> 05:57:11.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE YOU

05:57:11.476 --> 05:57:13.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONTAINING COSTS IN TERMS OF

05:57:13.678 --> 05:57:16.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRICES AND UTILIZATION BUT YOU

05:57:16.381 --> 05:57:18.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

05:57:18.784 --> 05:57:22.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ARE IMPROVING QUALITY. AND

05:57:22.387 --> 05:57:23.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS.

05:57:24.022 --> 05:57:25.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND SOMETIMES IMPROVING

INAPPROPRIATE CARE.

05:57:34.800 --> 05:57:36.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND SOMETIMES IT MEANS

05:57:36.268 --> 05:57:38.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCREASING UTILIZATION BECAUSE

05:57:38.203 --> 05:57:40.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE

05:57:40.205 --> 05:57:41.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

SHOWING UP AT THE ER FOR THESE

05:57:50.015 --> 05:57:52.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
VERY EXPENSIVE TREATMENT SO

05:57:52.551 --> 05:57:54.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU KNOW AS AS THE THE CHAIRS

THAT.

05:58:04.629 --> 05:58:07.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I AM TOTALLY NOT EXPERT AND

05:58:07.265 --> 05:58:08.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I DON'T THINK WE'VE TOTALLY SEEN

THE FOLKS THAT COVERED AS WE

MALPRACTICE THE STREAMLINING I

05:59:13.665 --> 05:59:14.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
MEAN.

05:59:14.466 --> 05:59:16.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
NO COST CONTAINMENT.

05:59:16.935 --> 05:59:18.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

ALWAYS ACCESS.

05:59:21.606 --> 05:59:23.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHY THE BUT? IT'S JUST AN OPEN

05:59:23.675 --> 05:59:25.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
QUESTION AS.

05:59:25.343 --> 05:59:28.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHY? WOULD WE DISCARD WHAT WE'VE

05:59:28.313 --> 05:59:30.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DONE WHICH IS NINETY TWO POINT

05:59:30.215 --> 05:59:31.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
FOUR PERCENT COVERAGE.

05:59:32.050 --> 05:59:34.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
RATHER THAN FOCUS ON.

05:59:34.319 --> 05:59:35.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOLVING SOME OF THE KEY PROBLEMS

05:59:36.021 --> 05:59:37.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WE KNOW MAYBE WE CAN GET A

05:59:37.322 --> 05:59:39.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
HANDLE ON A FOR YOU.

05:59:39.691 --> 05:59:41.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DID THAT RATHER AND START A

05:59:41.660 --> 05:59:43.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHOLE NEW SYSTEM TRYING TO GO

05:59:43.895 --> 05:59:45.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND GET THESE WAIVERS WITH AN

05:59:45.096 --> 05:59:46.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADMINISTRATION THAT IS CLEARLY

05:59:46.665 --> 05:59:48.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
NOT GONNA BE.

05:59:48.166 --> 05:59:50.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FAVORABLE THE CALIFORNIA THAT

05:59:50.435 --> 05:59:52.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COULD TAKE YEARS THAT. MAYBE

05:59:52.437 --> 05:59:55.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
LEAVE FOLKS KIND OF.

05:59:55.540 --> 05:59:56.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU KNOW NEEDING CARE ENOUGH

05:59:56.141 --> 05:59:57.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GETTING INTO. THIS IS A OPEN

05:59:57.442 --> 05:59:57.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
QUESTION.

05:59:58.009 --> 06:00:00.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
CAN.

06:00:00.445 --> 06:00:03.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
IS THAT NOT DOABLE.

06:00:04.015 --> 06:00:05.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO WHENEVER I WOULD AGREE THAT.

06:00:05.750 --> 06:00:07.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE PERSON WE NEED TO DO IS FIX

06:00:07.852 --> 06:00:10.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE CAN FIX AND SHORT THE CV WITH

06:00:10.155 --> 06:00:11.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MADE TREMENDOUS GAINS OF THE ACA

06:00:11.957 --> 06:00:13.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I ALSO AGREE WITH ANTHONY THAT.

06:00:13.391 --> 06:00:14.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:00:14.759 --> 06:00:16.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A ROBUST AND FUNCTIONING SYSTEM

06:00:16.761 --> 06:00:18.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BASED UPON THE ACA IS CAN BE

06:00:18.663 --> 06:00:20.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT MUCH CLOSER TO A MORE

06:00:20.732 --> 06:00:22.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMPREHENSIVE UNIVERSAL SYSTEM I

06:00:22.701 --> 06:00:25.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DON'T THINK. BY WORKING ON THAT

06:00:25.070 --> 06:00:26.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WERE MOVING AWAY FROM A LONG

06:00:27.038 --> 06:00:28.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TERM SOLUTION I MEAN AS SOARING

06:00:28.707 --> 06:00:29.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REPRESENTS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

06:00:29.641 --> 06:00:30.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHO THINK IT IS A CRAZY QUILT

06:00:31.042 --> 06:00:32.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SYSTEM I'M WELL YOU KNOW FIRST

06:00:32.877 --> 06:00:34.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF ALL. OF HIS ARMS UP TO TAKE

06:00:34.279 --> 06:00:35.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE TIME TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW

06:00:35.814 --> 06:00:36.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO LEARN ABOUT IT WILL MAKE IT

06:00:36.982 --> 06:00:38.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OFF FROM WHAT I CAN OFFER NOW

06:00:38.550 --> 06:00:40.218 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
THEY DON'T OFFER THEIR
EMPLOYEES.

06:00:40.285 --> 06:00:41.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW HAVE THE CHOICE OF

06:00:41.553 --> 06:00:42.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING TO THE INDIVIDUAL EXCHANGE

06:00:42.887 --> 06:00:44.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF OR MAYBE THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR

06:00:44.289 --> 06:00:46.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MEDI CAL I MEAN THAT DOESN'T

06:00:46.791 --> 06:00:47.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
MEAN WE SHOULDN'T.

06:00:47.859 --> 06:00:49.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROMOTE ALL THAT GOES ARE ALL

06:00:49.227 --> 06:00:50.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OPTIONS IT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE.

06:00:50.929 --> 06:00:51.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
BUT I DO THINK THAT.

06:00:51.997 --> 06:00:53.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:00:53.198 --> 06:00:54.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
BY DOING THAT.

06:00:54.799 --> 06:00:56.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
WE'VE SOLVED NAM

06:00:56.801 --> 06:00:57.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE DO OUR BEST TO SOLVE THOSE

06:00:57.402 --> 06:00:59.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROBLEMS AND THEN WE ALSO PUT

06:00:59.637 --> 06:01:01.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OURSELVES IN A POSITION. TO

06:01:01.439 --> 06:01:03.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU KNOW WORK ON

06:01:03.274 --> 06:01:04.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POTENTIAL LONG TERM SOLUTIONS

06:01:04.442 --> 06:01:05.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHICH TO HAVE FINANCIAL AND

06:01:06.044 --> 06:01:07.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LEGAL CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE

06:01:07.412 --> 06:01:09.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING TO BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY SO

06:01:09.280 --> 06:01:09.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DON'T THINK IT'S ONE VERSUS THE

06:01:09.914 --> 06:01:12.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
OTHER.

06:01:12.183 --> 06:01:13.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I IT AND AND I WOULD AGREE I

06:01:13.651 --> 06:01:15.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
DON'T I.

06:01:15.387 --> 06:01:16.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE. THE

06:01:16.955 --> 06:01:19.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DIALECTIC OF A CA VERSES OF A

06:01:19.691 --> 06:01:21.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEM I

06:01:21.359 --> 06:01:21.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE ALL

06:01:21.926 --> 06:01:23.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITHIN A IT OUT ALL WITHIN THE

06:01:23.428 --> 06:01:25.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPECTRUM AND THAT THE ACA DID.

06:01:25.997 --> 06:01:29.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT GET US CLOSER TO. A CLOSER TO

06:01:29.801 --> 06:01:30.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND

06:01:31.036 --> 06:01:32.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXPANDING YOU KNOW JUST GETTING

06:01:32.470 --> 06:01:33.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MORE PEOPLE INTO THE INTO THE

06:01:33.972 --> 06:01:35.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HEALTH SYSTEM IN EXPANDING

PROVIDING ADDITIONAL JUST

06:01:41.179 --> 06:01:43.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RESOURCES THAT IS THAT COULD BE

06:01:43.648 --> 06:01:45.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF IF IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER.

06:01:45.717 --> 06:01:48.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

DEFINING WHAT THE TERM COVERAGE

06:01:53.792 --> 06:01:55.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS AND WHAT IT YOU KNOW WHAT

06:01:55.360 --> 06:01:56.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL BENEFITS.

06:01:56.494 --> 06:01:58.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND AND AND SETTING A STANDARD

06:01:58.163 --> 06:01:59.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR THAT PUTTING LIMITS AND AND

06:01:59.898 --> 06:02:01.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MAXIMUMS FOR CO PAYMENTS AND

06:02:01.499 --> 06:02:02.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DEDUCTIBLES EVEN IF WE THINK

06:02:02.967 --> 06:02:04.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THEY'RE TOO HIGH THAT AT

06:02:04.369 --> 06:02:05.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEAST PUT PUT SOME DEFINITIONS

06:02:06.037 --> 06:02:07.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND STRUCTURES IN PLACE. THAT

06:02:07.338 --> 06:02:09.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEN OF WE CAN ADJUST GOING

06:02:09.541 --> 06:02:10.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
FORWARD.

06:02:10.208 --> 06:02:12.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IE IS AND I THINK IF WE CAN

06:02:12.844 --> 06:02:14.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH

06:02:14.079 --> 06:02:15.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REGARD TO COST WITH REGARD TO

IT'S THE ISSUE.

06:02:29.461 --> 06:02:31.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF IF WE CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE

06:02:31.362 --> 06:02:32.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S ONE LESS ISSUE THAN AND

06:02:32.397 --> 06:02:33.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
WE.

06:02:33.231 --> 06:02:35.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AT HAVE TO DEAL WITH WITH THE

06:02:35.233 --> 06:02:37.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH THE NEXT STEP THAT. IN IN

06:02:37.769 --> 06:02:39.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REFORMING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

06:02:39.104 --> 06:02:41.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF WE CAN DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF

06:02:41.639 --> 06:02:43.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF YOU KNOW DISH YOU KNOW. A

06:02:43.441 --> 06:02:45.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GETTING MORE PEOPLE IN COVERAGE.

06:02:45.777 --> 06:02:47.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THAT'S JUST

06:02:47.612 --> 06:02:48.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU ARE DEAD THAT MEANS THAT

06:02:48.880 --> 06:02:50.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUST NARROWS AND NARROWS THE

06:02:50.148 --> 06:02:52.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FURTHER GAPS I DON'T. WE'D.

06:02:52.117 --> 06:02:53.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT

06:02:53.718 --> 06:02:55.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE DECISION EITHER OR THIS IS A

06:02:55.353 --> 06:02:56.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
CONTINUUM AND WE.

06:02:56.921 --> 06:02:58.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHERE LONGEST CONTINUE AND WE

06:02:58.990 --> 06:02:59.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UNDER AND WE APPRECIATE THAT

06:02:59.724 --> 06:03:02.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE? SOME PEOPLE ON THE DICE

06:03:02.093 --> 06:03:05.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT MAY HAVE DIFFERENT DESIRES

06:03:05.230 --> 06:03:06.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF WHERE YOU WANT TO END UP ON

06:03:06.631 --> 06:03:09.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT CONTINUUM. AND AND AND SO I

06:03:09.167 --> 06:03:11.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE HOPE THAT LIKE A THAT AGENDA

06:03:11.669 --> 06:03:13.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
ON COST CONTAINMENT IS
SOMETHING.

06:03:13.338 --> 06:03:15.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
YOU KNOW LIKE.

06:03:15.140 --> 06:03:16.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIKE THE WORK THAT WE DID LAST

06:03:16.774 --> 06:03:18.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEAR ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS

06:03:18.343 --> 06:03:20.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMETHING THAT FAX INTEREST FROM

06:03:20.078 --> 06:03:21.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. IT EVEN

06:03:21.980 --> 06:03:24.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF YOU DON'T I'LL BUY INTO THE

06:03:24.082 --> 06:03:25.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FACT THAT THAT AND THAT IS.

06:03:25.316 --> 06:03:26.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:03:26.584 --> 06:03:28.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I TAKES US ALL THE WAY TO A

06:03:28.887 --> 06:03:29.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM I DON'T

06:03:29.854 --> 06:03:31.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINK YOU I THINK THAT WE CAN

06:03:31.422 --> 06:03:32.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE SOME AGREEMENT ON THAT THE

06:03:32.724 --> 06:03:34.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
NEXT COUPLE OF STEPS.

06:03:34.292 --> 06:03:36.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVEN IF WE'RE NOT ALL THE EVEN

06:03:36.127 --> 06:03:37.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IF YOU DON'T BUY INTO WHERE'D

06:03:37.529 --> 06:03:38.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHERE'D ALL IS BECAUSE THAT CAN

06:03:38.730 --> 06:03:39.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A

06:03:39.797 --> 06:03:42.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SLIPPERY SLOPE BUY BIT ARE. AND

06:03:42.200 --> 06:03:43.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOW YOU MAY DO YOU MAY DECIDE

06:03:43.535 --> 06:03:45.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THE THE VIEW IS IS IS OKAY

06:03:45.837 --> 06:03:47.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AT. NEXT LEVEL THE MOUNTAIN

06:03:47.272 --> 06:03:48.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHERE OTHERS WANT TO KEEP

06:03:48.406 --> 06:03:50.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
CLIMBING TO THE TOP.

06:03:50.675 --> 06:03:51.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WELL THANK YOU THAT'S AN

06:03:51.376 --> 06:03:52.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXCELLENT POINT BECAUSE I THINK

06:03:52.777 --> 06:03:53.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL

06:03:53.344 --> 06:03:53.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
WANT TO HAVE A.

06:03:53.711 --> 06:03:55.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
PAGE

06:03:55.580 --> 06:03:57.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PATIENTS SOMEONE THAT SOMETIMES

06:03:57.415 --> 06:03:59.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SLIPS THROUGH THE CRACKS

06:03:59.284 --> 06:04:01.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO I I'M GONNA WHO BY LIKE FOUR

06:04:01.586 --> 06:04:02.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
QUESTIONS INTO ONE THE FIFTH.

06:04:02.854 --> 06:04:03.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SAKE OF TIME THIS IS ONE NO

06:04:04.055 --> 06:04:06.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE'S GONNA LIKE BUT I JUST NEED

06:04:06.124 --> 06:04:08.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
TO SAY IS.

06:04:08.159 --> 06:04:09.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WILL LOOK TO VERMONT.

06:04:09.294 --> 06:04:11.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THREE YEARS AGO THEY HAD TO

06:04:11.262 --> 06:04:14.165 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
WITHDRAW FROM THEIR SINGLE
PAYER.

06:04:14.232 --> 06:04:16.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A NEW NO PLAN THAT WAS SIGNED

06:04:16.668 --> 06:04:18.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
INTO LAW THE HEAD A BILL IS

06:04:18.436 --> 06:04:19.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
SIGNED INTO LAW ON TWENTY
ELEVEN.

06:04:20.038 --> 06:04:21.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE THE INCOME AND PAYROLL

06:04:21.339 --> 06:04:23.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TAXES HAD TO GO UP SO MUCH NOW

06:04:23.608 --> 06:04:25.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
VERMONT IS A LOT SMALLER THAN

06:04:25.076 --> 06:04:26.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CALIFORNIA SO THAT COULD HAVE

06:04:26.077 --> 06:04:27.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
BEEN.

06:04:27.812 --> 06:04:28.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PART OF THE ISSUE THERE.

06:04:28.846 --> 06:04:30.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:04:31.049 --> 06:04:33.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COLORADO VOTERS VOTERS REJECTED

06:04:33.651 --> 06:04:35.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A SINGLE PAYER PLAN IN TWENTY

06:04:35.186 --> 06:04:37.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY.

06:04:38.056 --> 06:04:40.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
A RATIO.

06:04:40.758 --> 06:04:42.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC

06:04:42.360 --> 06:04:43.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GOVERNOR HAD TO URGE HIS OF

06:04:43.995 --> 06:04:46.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VOTERS NOT TO SUPPORT THE BILL

06:04:46.197 --> 06:04:47.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE OF A DOUBLE THE STATE

06:04:47.265 --> 06:04:49.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
BUDGET.

06:04:49.234 --> 06:04:51.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEN WE LOOKED WE DID HAVE A

06:04:51.536 --> 06:04:53.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOT HEARINGS WITHOUT THAT OTHER

06:04:53.271 --> 06:04:54.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STATES WITH THEIR DOING WOULD

06:04:54.439 --> 06:04:56.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOOK THAT OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH

06:04:56.207 --> 06:04:57.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAS ACTUALLY FASCINATING AND

06:04:57.842 --> 06:04:57.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
VERY.

06:04:58.042 --> 06:04:59.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:04:59.377 --> 06:05:02.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
INFORMATIVE.

06:05:02.547 --> 06:05:04.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LIST THEM WE SAW THE SCALE OF

06:05:04.082 --> 06:05:05.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOW MUCH WE'RE PAYING AND HOW

06:05:05.416 --> 06:05:07.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MUCH LESS WE YET VERSUS OTHER

06:05:07.185 --> 06:05:09.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COUNTRIES WHEN YOU LOOK THAT AND

06:05:09.120 --> 06:05:10.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT UP ABOUT

06:05:10.188 --> 06:05:12.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE NETWORK OF SOCIAL SERVICES

06:05:12.290 --> 06:05:12.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NORMALLY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

06:05:12.890 --> 06:05:13.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
BEING DONE.

06:05:13.424 --> 06:05:15.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
HOW?

06:05:15.460 --> 06:05:17.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE ONES THAT SEEM TO WORK THE

06:05:17.228 --> 06:05:19.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
BEST ACTUALLY HAD.

06:05:19.430 --> 06:05:21.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
MORE PAYER OPTIONS

06:05:21.599 --> 06:05:24.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEY ACTUALLY HAD PRIVATE.

06:05:24.502 --> 06:05:26.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PLANS MIXED IN WITH THE

06:05:26.337 --> 06:05:27.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
GOVERNMENT PLANS.

06:05:27.305 --> 06:05:29.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:05:29.340 --> 06:05:30.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOUGH SEEM TO BE THE ONES THAT

06:05:30.942 --> 06:05:33.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WERE REALLY THE STRONGEST.

06:05:33.311 --> 06:05:36.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND YOU KNOW I PARKS I'VE.

06:05:36.681 --> 06:05:38.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I DON'T A LOT OF STUDY ON IT.

06:05:38.182 --> 06:05:40.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAME UP WITH THERE WAS A STUDY

06:05:40.184 --> 06:05:42.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S BEEN DONE OF THIS AND ANY

06:05:42.086 --> 06:05:43.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OVER TWO DECADES TO ALL

CANADA. AND IT LOOKS AT WAIT

06:05:48.092 --> 06:05:49.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TIMES IT'S A BIG SERVICES

06:05:49.894 --> 06:05:51.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMEONE FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

06:05:51.562 --> 06:05:52.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND IT'S SHOWING THAT.

06:05:52.497 --> 06:05:55.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:05:55.133 --> 06:05:56.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO SIT FROM APART FROM GETTING

AND SO EIGHT SO I.

06:08:25.983 --> 06:08:27.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE THERE ARE MECHANISMS TO TRY

TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO TO

06:08:28.953 --> 06:08:29.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PRIMARY CARE RATHER THAN

EMERGING. EMERGENCY ROOMS

06:08:31.122 --> 06:08:32.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABSOLUTELY AND AND WE THINK THE

06:08:32.757 --> 06:08:34.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KEY THING IS TO PROVIDE THOSE

06:08:34.325 --> 06:08:36.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
URGENT CARE AND PRIMARY CARE AND

06:08:36.294 --> 06:08:38.896 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%

THAN USE THE E. ARE

APPROPRIATELY BUT I'D. I AGAIN I

06:08:45.236 --> 06:08:46.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DON'T THINK ANYBODY OR.

.

06:08:48.039 --> 06:08:49.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I DID DESIRES TO DO THAT THERE'S

06:08:49.640 --> 06:08:51.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THERE ARE EXISTING SYSTEMS

06:08:51.476 --> 06:08:52.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN PLACE FOR THE QUOTE UNQUOTE

SPECIFIC ARE ISSUES BUT THOSE

06:08:59.283 --> 06:09:00.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TEND TO BE IN ISSUES MORE ABOUT

06:09:01.052 --> 06:09:02.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND ABOUT

06:09:02.753 --> 06:09:04.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

OTHER TYPES OF OF.

SERVICES IN PLACE AND I THINK

06:09:09.827 --> 06:09:11.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE DATA ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT IN

06:09:11.329 --> 06:09:12.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FACT A LOT OF. THERE'S A LOT OF

06:09:12.897 --> 06:09:15.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THOSE ARE A LOT OF OUR.

06:09:15.600 --> 06:09:16.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE A

06:09:16.434 --> 06:09:17.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
VERY HIGH HEALTHCARE COSTS

06:09:18.002 --> 06:09:19.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AMERICA'S BECAUSE WE HAVE OF WE

06:09:19.570 --> 06:09:20.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACTUALLY HAVE RELATIVELY LOW

NET.

06:09:22.773 --> 06:09:25.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND AND SO THAT AND SO IT IT IT

06:09:25.610 --> 06:09:27.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
IT IT'S REFLECTED.

06:09:27.411 --> 06:09:28.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS A

06:09:28.980 --> 06:09:31.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RESULT AND I AND I THINK AND

06:09:31.182 --> 06:09:32.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT MAYBE GOES TO THIS OUR. OUR

THAT I MEAN AT THE END OF THE

06:09:40.725 --> 06:09:42.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DAY CALIFORNIA WILL CREATE ITS

BELIEVES THAT THAT GOAL IS A

06:11:14.051 --> 06:11:15.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
NOBLE ONE.

06:11:15.753 --> 06:11:17.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

REGARDING THE FAMILY GLITCH.

06:11:29.500 --> 06:11:31.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOW COULD WE BETTER MEET THE

NEEDS OF OUR FAMILIES AND WHAT

ABOUT THE UNDER INSURED.

THAT'S AN AREA THAT REALLY

06:11:59.130 --> 06:12:01.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
TOUCHES HOME TO ME.

06:12:01.132 --> 06:12:01.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHEN YOU BROUGHT UP THE FACT

06:12:01.699 --> 06:12:03.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

06:12:03.167 --> 06:12:04.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR IS GOING

06:12:04.235 --> 06:12:06.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TOWARD HEALTH CARE I'M REMINDED

06:12:06.070 --> 06:12:07.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

DOLLARS AN HOUR.

06:12:10.875 --> 06:12:13.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WANTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE

06:12:13.444 --> 06:12:15.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
COULD DO AS A STATE.

06:12:15.479 --> 06:12:17.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO HELP IN PAYING FOR THOSE

06:12:17.348 --> 06:12:18.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING SO

06:12:18.749 --> 06:12:20.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT OPPORTUNITIES WE HAD TO

06:12:20.384 --> 06:12:21.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS WITHIN OUR

06:12:21.719 --> 06:12:26.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

06:12:26.724 --> 06:12:28.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUT OF TAKE A COUPLE OF THESE.

06:12:28.759 --> 06:12:31.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT NOT NOT ALL OF THEM SO I'M

06:12:31.195 --> 06:12:32.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR THE FAMILY WHICH I MEAN THAT

06:12:32.897 --> 06:12:33.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND AS I SAID THAT PARTICULARLY.

06:12:33.964 --> 06:12:35.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HERTZ

06:12:35.666 --> 06:12:36.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT TEND TO

06:12:36.934 --> 06:12:39.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE PLANS THAT ARE A PLEA ONLY

06:12:39.537 --> 06:12:40.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHEN THEY DO HAVE PLANS THAT ARE

06:12:40.504 --> 06:12:42.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MORE MORE OFTEN EMPLOYEE ONLY

06:12:42.506 --> 06:12:44.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEN LARGER. ORGANIZATIONS

06:12:44.275 --> 06:12:45.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUSINESS I HAVE CLIENTS THAT

06:12:46.043 --> 06:12:46.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OFTEN INCLUDE DEPENDENCE.

06:12:46.877 --> 06:12:48.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:12:48.813 --> 06:12:50.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD DEFER TO

06:12:50.414 --> 06:12:53.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXPERTS HERE I'M NOT SURE THAT.

06:12:53.350 --> 06:12:55.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT WE AND OTHER WORDS I THINK

06:12:55.653 --> 06:12:57.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THAT FEDERAL.

06:12:57.521 --> 06:12:58.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU BET WE CAN INCREASE THE

06:12:58.656 --> 06:12:59.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FEDERAL SUBSIDIES ON AROUND YOU

06:12:59.990 --> 06:13:01.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
KNOW TO TO COVER.

DEPENDENCE OF.

06:13:04.128 --> 06:13:05.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE WHO WERE LATER POLICE THAT

06:13:05.463 --> 06:13:06.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE PLANTS WHERE THEY MEET THE

06:13:06.697 --> 06:13:07.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AFFORDABILITY STANDARD.

06:13:08.065 --> 06:13:10.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO I THINK IT WOULD REQUIRE

06:13:10.468 --> 06:13:11.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FUNDING I MEAN AT THIS BE CLEAR

06:13:12.002 --> 06:13:13.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

06:14:30.948 --> 06:14:39.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOCUMENTED AND UNDOCUMENTED.

06:14:39.123 --> 06:14:41.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I WOULD AGAIN AND AND I.

06:14:41.725 --> 06:14:42.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FUND AGREEING WITH JOHN OF THE

06:14:42.893 --> 06:14:44.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FAMILY WHICH I THINK IT IS

06:14:44.161 --> 06:14:46.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CERTAINLY HAD A DOABLE PROPOSAL

06:14:46.197 --> 06:14:47.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE HAVE AND MODELING HOW MUCH

06:14:47.264 --> 06:14:48.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SHOULD WE ARE HOW MUCH MONEY

06:14:48.766 --> 06:14:49.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WOULD BE REYES AND I DO THINK

06:14:49.900 --> 06:14:52.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DEPENDING ON. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE

06:14:52.136 --> 06:14:53.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES IT

06:14:53.070 --> 06:14:54.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ACT ACTION MIGHT HAVE SOME

06:14:54.171 --> 06:14:55.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
IMPACT ON HOW MUCH.

06:14:55.506 --> 06:14:57.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FIXING THE FAMILY WHICH IS THIS

06:14:57.842 --> 06:14:59.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS SOMETHING THAT WE BELIEVE

06:14:59.210 --> 06:15:00.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT A DE A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT

06:15:00.744 --> 06:15:02.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WITH A DIFFERENT AYE ARRESTS

06:15:02.179 --> 06:15:03.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WOULD HAVE INTERPRETED IN

06:15:03.080 --> 06:15:03.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DIFFERENT WAY AND WOULD HAVE

06:15:03.814 --> 06:15:05.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOLVED IS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

06:15:05.316 --> 06:15:06.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT AGAINST GIVEN THAT WE DON'T

06:15:07.017 --> 06:15:08.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE THAT FOR THE NEXT THREE

06:15:08.152 --> 06:15:09.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YEARS IT WOULD IT WOULD BE

06:15:09.453 --> 06:15:11.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
APPROPRIATE TO TAKE A LOOK. FOR

06:15:11.488 --> 06:15:13.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOLKS AGAIN YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS

06:15:13.891 --> 06:15:15.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHO GET WORKER COVERAGE FOR

06:15:15.426 --> 06:15:16.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEMSELVES BUT NOT AFFORDABLE

06:15:17.061 --> 06:15:17.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
COVERAGE FOR THEIR FAMILY

06:15:18.062 --> 06:15:19.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MEMBERS AND IT'S THOSE FAMILY

06:15:19.263 --> 06:15:20.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
MEMBERS THAT ARE.

06:15:20.097 --> 06:15:21.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY

06:15:21.799 --> 06:15:23.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TO GET SUBSIDIES IN THE

06:15:23.067 --> 06:15:25.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EXCHANGES AT ADDED ARE AS A

06:15:25.536 --> 06:15:26.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RESULT SOME OF THOSE FOLKS.

06:15:27.037 --> 06:15:28.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BY COVERAGE ANYWAY THEY JUST

06:15:28.405 --> 06:15:29.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
PROVIDED A MUCH HIGHER

06:15:29.740 --> 06:15:31.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
PERCENTAGE OF THE.

06:15:31.075 --> 06:15:33.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OF OF THEIR INCOME AND.

06:15:33.544 --> 06:15:34.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD IT

06:15:34.945 --> 06:15:36.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WOULD PROVIDE A GO A LONG WAY

06:15:36.380 --> 06:15:38.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TOWARD AFFORDABILITY IT'S NOT A

06:15:38.616 --> 06:15:39.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IT'S NOT A HUGE POPULAR

06:15:39.917 --> 06:15:40.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ELATION IT'S.

06:15:40.951 --> 06:15:42.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT IT'S IT'S A POPULATION

06:15:42.887 --> 06:15:45.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DESERVES SOME ATTENTION A DISH

06:15:45.389 --> 06:15:46.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE OR

06:15:46.257 --> 06:15:47.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
FOR OTHER AFFORDABILITY

06:15:47.091 --> 06:15:49.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROPOSALS THAT WE OUTLINED ON

06:15:49.393 --> 06:15:51.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO I DO IS

06:15:51.095 --> 06:15:52.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO DO ONE OF JUST HIGHLIGHT.

06:15:52.696 --> 06:15:54.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WHAT THIS IS BECAUSE?

06:15:54.265 --> 06:15:55.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S A VERY TECHNICAL TERM BUT

06:15:55.900 --> 06:15:57.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT LITERALLY IS THAT HOW THE

06:15:57.568 --> 06:15:59.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
INSURERS DESCRIBED.

06:15:59.503 --> 06:16:01.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOW MUCH MONEY IS QUOTE UNQUOTE

06:16:01.605 --> 06:16:04.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LOST TO ACTUAL MEDICAL CARE?

06:16:04.341 --> 06:16:05.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

06:16:05.743 --> 06:16:06.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

06:16:06.277 --> 06:16:08.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT IS THAT OF ITS TO

06:16:08.979 --> 06:16:10.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DESCRIPTION OF HOW MUCH MONEY.

06:16:10.447 --> 06:16:12.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS GOING TO MEDICAL CARE THAT

06:16:12.449 --> 06:16:12.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ARE.

06:16:12.850 --> 06:16:14.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
AND

06:16:14.885 --> 06:16:15.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW WE WE THINK THAT THAT

06:16:15.753 --> 06:16:18.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SHOULD BE HIGHER AND AND JUST AS

06:16:18.789 --> 06:16:20.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PUBLIC PROGRAMS DO IT WHETHER IT

06:16:20.457 --> 06:16:22.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BE MEDICARE OR MEDIC HOW BOTH I.

06:16:23.060 --> 06:16:23.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HAVE.

06:16:23.527 --> 06:16:25.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MUCH HIGHER MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS

06:16:25.829 --> 06:16:26.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET

06:16:27.064 --> 06:16:28.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOW SOME OF THAT IS JUST THE.

06:16:28.966 --> 06:16:31.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR. IMPACT OF HAVING A SYSTEM

06:16:31.802 --> 06:16:33.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHERE YOU HAVE TO DO MARKETING

06:16:33.103 --> 06:16:35.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND HIGHER UP PEOPLE TO HELP SO

06:16:35.372 --> 06:16:36.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE PRODUCT AND YOU KNOW THE

06:16:36.840 --> 06:16:38.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TRANSACTIONAL COSTS O. WITH

06:16:38.542 --> 06:16:39.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RELATION TO THAT BUT SOME OF

06:16:39.476 --> 06:16:41.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IS ABOUT PROFIT AND SOME OF

06:16:41.078 --> 06:16:42.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT IS ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE.

06:16:42.112 --> 06:16:43.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BURDEN AND SO TAKING A LOOK AT

06:16:43.881 --> 06:16:45.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HOW WE CAN DO IT DO THAT

06:16:45.182 --> 06:16:47.384 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU KNOW WE
ARE.

06:16:47.451 --> 06:16:52.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
MORE ON THE.

06:16:53.057 --> 06:16:55.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CALIFORNIA SIDE OF CHINESE YOU

06:16:55.592 --> 06:16:57.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW HOW THAT CENTRALIZING GET

06:16:57.094 --> 06:16:59.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PEOPLE YOU KNOW INTO THESE PLANS

06:16:59.463 --> 06:17:00.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT DID DOES THAT MEAN THAT

06:17:00.731 --> 06:17:02.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HATE NOW WE CAN. ASK THE

06:17:02.866 --> 06:17:07.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
INSURERS TO. OF. OUR.

06:17:07.271 --> 06:17:09.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BE MORE EFFICIENT I'M SINCE

06:17:09.873 --> 06:17:11.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COVERED CALIFORNIA'S DOING SOME

06:17:12.042 --> 06:17:12.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
OF THAT WORK.

06:17:12.876 --> 06:17:15.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT

06:17:15.546 --> 06:17:17.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.

06:17:17.648 --> 06:17:18.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BEFORE WE GET TO THE OTHER ONES

06:17:18.282 --> 06:17:18.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
I JUST

06:17:18.482 --> 06:17:21.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SURE I UP.

06:17:21.285 --> 06:17:22.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FULLY BY INCREASING THE MEDICAL

06:17:22.519 --> 06:17:22.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
LOSS RATIO.

06:17:22.820 --> 06:17:23.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
PREMIUMS THAT

06:17:23.988 --> 06:17:26.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALIFORNIANS ARE PAYING MORE OF.

06:17:26.623 --> 06:17:27.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SCENT OF THAT PREMIUMS WILL GO

06:17:27.257 --> 06:17:28.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
TOWARDS

06:17:28.492 --> 06:17:30.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DIRECT HEALTHCARE RELATED COSTS

06:17:30.961 --> 06:17:31.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT TRACK SO WE WILL SEE A

06:17:31.829 --> 06:17:33.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
BETTER BENEFIT.

06:17:33.163 --> 06:17:35.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BY INCREASING THE MEDICAL LOSS

06:17:35.165 --> 06:17:38.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RATIO IN TERMS OF DIRECT RESULT

06:17:38.235 --> 06:17:40.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS CALIFORNIA VETERANS DAY YEAH

06:17:40.404 --> 06:17:41.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I MEAN CURRENTLY THE WAY THE

06:17:41.705 --> 06:17:44.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACA WORKS IS THAT IF IT IF THEY

06:17:44.174 --> 06:17:47.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPEND TOO MUCH. OF. IT IF THEY

06:17:47.378 --> 06:17:49.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
VIOLATE THE MLR STANDARD THAN

06:17:49.213 --> 06:17:49.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
ACTUALLY.

06:17:49.847 --> 06:17:53.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INDIVIDUALS GET REBATES AND YOU

06:17:53.283 --> 06:17:55.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
KNOW CALIFORNIA AT THE X.

06:17:55.552 --> 06:17:57.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARCHITECTURE THE HUNDREDS OF

06:17:57.654 --> 06:17:59.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THOUSANDS CALIFORNIANS HAVE

06:17:59.723 --> 06:18:01.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOTTEN DEBATE THEY TEND TO BE

06:18:01.125 --> 06:18:04.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RELATIVELY SMALL. A CHECKS

06:18:04.261 --> 06:18:11.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BECAUSE BUT IT IS A A A.

06:18:11.135 --> 06:18:13.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S IT'S A IT'S A USEFUL PRIDE

06:18:13.103 --> 06:18:15.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO ENCOURAGE THE INSURERS TO.

06:18:15.672 --> 06:18:17.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT IF THEY IF THEY ARE GOING

06:18:17.608 --> 06:18:20.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO TRY TO PROVIDE VALUE FOR THE

06:18:20.110 --> 06:18:21.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
CONSUMER THAT THEY THAT THEY
ARE.

06:18:21.712 --> 06:18:23.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THE THAT

06:18:23.680 --> 06:18:26.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
DAISY YOU KNOW TO PUT.

06:18:26.717 --> 06:18:27.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE PROOF FOR THE PUTTING PLAYER

06:18:28.052 --> 06:18:29.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO SAY IF THEY ARE THAT THEY'RE

06:18:30.020 --> 06:18:30.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOING TO SPEND EIGHTY EIGHTY

06:18:30.654 --> 06:18:31.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
FIVE WHATEVER THE RIGHT

06:18:31.822 --> 06:18:33.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
PERCENTAGES FOR.

06:18:33.157 --> 06:18:34.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
FOR PATIENT CARE.

06:18:34.825 --> 06:18:35.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUT WE ALSO THINK THAT THEN

06:18:35.993 --> 06:18:38.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT DOES STILL CIRCLE BACK TO.

06:18:38.495 --> 06:18:39.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF EIGHTY OR EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT

06:18:39.296 --> 06:18:41.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THE OF THE PREMIUM IS DOCTORS

06:18:41.432 --> 06:18:43.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HOSPITALS AND DRUGS THAT WE

06:18:43.067 --> 06:18:44.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
STILL NEED A MECHANISM TO

06:18:44.468 --> 06:18:45.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ADDRESS ADDRESSING THOSE BASE

06:18:45.402 --> 06:18:47.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COSTS AND THAT'S THE KIND OF

06:18:47.171 --> 06:18:48.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINGS THAT I THINK SEVERAL OF

06:18:48.372 --> 06:18:49.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
US HAVE BEEN TALKING TO.

06:18:49.206 --> 06:18:51.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
AND JUST TO FINISH

06:18:51.341 --> 06:18:53.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO I CAN PASS IT ON YOU KNOW I.

06:23:08.765 --> 06:23:10.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IMPRESSIONS OF.

06:23:10.500 --> 06:23:13.170 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
WHAT WE THINK HEALTH CARE IS
AND?

06:23:13.236 --> 06:23:14.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE SLOGANS AT A LOT OF THE

06:23:14.638 --> 06:23:16.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACTIVISTS USE ABOUT HEALTHCARE

06:23:16.606 --> 06:23:18.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEING A HUMAN RIGHT. MIHT KIND

06:23:18.909 --> 06:23:20.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF SOUND OBVIOUS BUT IT'S REALLY

06:23:20.811 --> 06:23:22.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT OBVIOUS AND IT'S CERTAINLY

06:23:22.079 --> 06:23:23.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NOT IN THE WAY THAT HEALTH

06:23:23.580 --> 06:23:24.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CARE'S BEEN REGARDED IN THIS

06:23:24.581 --> 06:23:26.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
COUNTRY.

06:23:26.083 --> 06:23:27.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW THERE WAS ONCE A TIME

06:23:27.751 --> 06:23:29.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'M SURE WHERE YOU KNOW. THE WAY

06:23:29.486 --> 06:23:30.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT PEOPLE GOT HEALTHCARE WAS

06:23:30.887 --> 06:23:32.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEIR IN THEIR SMALL TOWN AND

06:23:32.222 --> 06:23:33.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE WERE IT WAS A DOCTOR TO

06:23:33.323 --> 06:23:34.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IF YOU GOT SICK YOU WENT TO

06:23:34.891 --> 06:23:36.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT DOCTOR BUT WE'VE EVOLVED.

06:23:36.393 --> 06:23:37.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW THERE WAS ONCE A TIME

06:23:37.327 --> 06:23:38.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN IF YOUR

06:23:38.862 --> 06:23:40.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOUSE WAS ON FIRE THERE WERE

06:23:40.397 --> 06:23:42.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENT PRIVATE FIRE COMPANIES

06:23:42.766 --> 06:23:43.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT YOU COULD CALL THAT WOULD

06:23:44.000 --> 06:23:45.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KIND OF COME AND YOU COULD PAY

06:23:46.036 --> 06:23:47.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEM OR NOT PAY THEM TO AND IF

06:23:47.404 --> 06:23:48.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU DIDN'T PAY HIM THEY WOULDN'T

06:23:48.939 --> 06:23:50.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
PUT. YOUR FIRE OUT.

06:23:50.440 --> 06:23:51.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT A CERTAIN POINT AS A SOCIETY

06:23:51.208 --> 06:23:52.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
WE DECIDED THAT.

06:23:52.709 --> 06:23:54.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE HAD A PUBLIC BENEFIT TOWARDS

06:23:55.045 --> 06:23:57.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEIR BEING PUBLIC SAFETY THAT

06:23:57.280 --> 06:23:58.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE ALL PAID FOR. AND THE SAME

06:23:59.015 --> 06:23:59.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THING WITH PUBLIC EDUCATION

06:23:59.950 --> 06:24:01.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOBODY QUESTIONS THAT ALL OF US

06:24:02.018 --> 06:24:05.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PAY COLLECTIVELY INTO EDUCATING

06:24:05.255 --> 06:24:06.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOCIETIES CHILDREN WHETHER THE

06:24:06.523 --> 06:24:08.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOUR CHILD OR SOMEBODY ELSE'S

06:24:08.158 --> 06:24:09.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
CHILD.

06:24:09.726 --> 06:24:11.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS. THE

06:24:11.361 --> 06:24:12.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RESULT WHEN I SAY THIS I MEAN

06:24:12.696 --> 06:24:14.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS HEARING AND PEOPLE BEING

06:24:14.231 --> 06:24:15.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HERE IS NOT JUST A RESULT OF

06:24:15.399 --> 06:24:16.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COSTS GOING UP AND MEDICARE

06:24:16.600 --> 06:24:19.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MEDICAID. MEDICAL CARE BEING

06:24:19.236 --> 06:24:20.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LESS AND LESS EXPENSIVE BUT OF

06:24:20.737 --> 06:24:22.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EVOLVING PERCEPTION ABOUT

06:24:22.172 --> 06:24:23.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEALTHCARE BEING SOMETHING THAT

06:24:23.373 --> 06:24:25.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
WE SHOULD ALL HAVE.

06:24:25.142 --> 06:24:25.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL

06:24:25.809 --> 06:24:26.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE EQUALLY AND THAT EVERYONE

06:24:26.643 --> 06:24:28.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
SHOULD EXPECT.

06:24:28.345 --> 06:24:29.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE REALLY DO NEED TO CHANGE THE

06:24:29.913 --> 06:24:30.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WAY WE THINK ABOUT PAYING FOR

06:24:31.047 --> 06:24:32.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEIR HEALTHCARE. WE DON'T

06:24:32.482 --> 06:24:34.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
EXPECT EVERYBODY TO PAY

06:24:34.084 --> 06:24:35.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INDIVIDUALLY FOR THEIR CHILDREN

06:24:35.552 --> 06:24:37.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING TO SCHOOL. YOU KNOW WE ALL

06:24:37.721 --> 06:24:39.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PAY WE ALL QUE AND NOBODY

06:24:39.923 --> 06:24:41.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
QUESTIONS UP BECAUSE WE KNOW

06:24:41.158 --> 06:24:42.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE'S A PUBLIC GOOD FOR ALL OF

06:24:42.893 --> 06:24:45.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
US OF HAVING EDUCATED CHILDREN.

06:24:45.929 --> 06:24:47.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WE HAVE GOT TO THINK ABOUT

06:24:47.764 --> 06:24:49.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTHCARE IN THE SAME WAY FOR

06:24:49.199 --> 06:24:51.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVER GOING TO HAVE THE KIND OF

06:24:51.835 --> 06:24:53.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HEALTH CARE THAT WE WANT AND THE

06:24:53.336 --> 06:24:54.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KIND OF ACCESS WE WANT. BECAUSE

06:24:54.905 --> 06:24:56.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER FROM

06:24:56.173 --> 06:24:57.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS BEEN UP

06:24:57.974 --> 06:25:01.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
HERE FROM ACROSS THE
IDEOLOGICAL.

06:25:01.111 --> 06:25:02.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SCALE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE

06:25:02.312 --> 06:25:04.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STUDIED THIS ISSUE THAT THE

06:25:04.347 --> 06:25:05.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SYSTEM THAT WE'VE HAD THAT'S

06:25:05.649 --> 06:25:06.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
JUST BEEN THE SYSTEM THAT'S NOT

06:25:06.316 --> 06:25:07.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TRULY A BALL FOR TWO HUNDRED

06:25:07.851 --> 06:25:09.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YEARS. IS ONE OF JUST ALMOST

06:25:10.020 --> 06:25:10.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
UNBRIDLED FREE MARKET

06:25:10.754 --> 06:25:12.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
COMPETITION.

06:25:12.589 --> 06:25:14.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
WITH IT WITH.

06:25:14.090 --> 06:25:15.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PRIVATE COMPANIES PAYING THE

06:25:15.392 --> 06:25:17.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BULK OF HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR

06:25:17.561 --> 06:25:18.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEIR EMPLOYEES AT GREAT COST TO

06:25:18.528 --> 06:25:19.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THEM.

06:25:19.996 --> 06:25:21.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND WITH A MARKET THAT'S.

06:25:21.731 --> 06:25:23.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALMOST UNREGULATED IS COMPARED

06:25:23.467 --> 06:25:25.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO OTHER DEVELOPED NATIONS.

06:25:25.235 --> 06:25:26.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
AND SO.

06:25:26.970 --> 06:25:29.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:25:29.906 --> 06:25:31.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
BUT THE SINGLE PAYER

06:25:31.074 --> 06:25:32.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
CONVERSATION IS

06:25:32.976 --> 06:25:34.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU NO IT'S IMPORTANT BUT THE

06:25:34.411 --> 06:25:35.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SINGLE BUT WHETHER WERE SINGLE

06:25:35.979 --> 06:25:37.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PAYER OR NOT. THAT'S ONLY PART

06:25:37.848 --> 06:25:39.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF THE EQUATION TOWARDS REALLY

06:25:39.115 --> 06:25:40.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVING THE KIND OF HEALTHCARE

06:25:40.417 --> 06:25:42.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SYSTEM THAT WE NEED BECAUSE WE

06:25:42.252 --> 06:25:43.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
HAVE GOT TO.

06:25:43.787 --> 06:25:45.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DO THAT THE COUPLE OF THINGS

06:25:45.522 --> 06:25:47.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE

06:25:47.123 --> 06:25:48.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WE'VE BEEN RELUCTANT TO DO.

06:25:48.792 --> 06:25:51.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NUMBER ONE TO TRULY REGULATE THE

06:25:51.094 --> 06:25:52.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY.

06:25:52.963 --> 06:25:54.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
FROM BEGINNING TO END

06:25:54.264 --> 06:25:56.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SO THAT.

06:25:56.099 --> 06:25:58.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COSTS ARE KEPT UNDER CONTROL BY

06:25:58.502 --> 06:26:00.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION.

06:26:00.270 --> 06:26:01.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EVERY OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRY

06:26:01.238 --> 06:26:02.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
DOES IT.

06:26:02.906 --> 06:26:04.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WE DO IT IN A LOT OF AREAS

06:26:04.674 --> 06:26:07.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW IN IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND

06:26:07.511 --> 06:26:09.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN EDUCATION AND IN UTILITIES

06:26:09.346 --> 06:26:11.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WATER AND POWER. WE DON'T HAVE

06:26:11.214 --> 06:26:13.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE UNBRIDLED FREE MARKET WORK.

06:26:13.750 --> 06:26:15.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OUR GOVERNMENTS DECIDE WHAT'S

06:26:15.852 --> 06:26:18.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING TO BE PUTS FAIR TO PAY FOR

06:26:18.188 --> 06:26:19.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THOSE

06:26:19.222 --> 06:26:20.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SERVICES WE ALL GET TO SEE WHAT

06:26:20.590 --> 06:26:22.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THAT IS.

06:26:22.726 --> 06:26:24.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EVERYBODY CAN LOOK AT THEIR

06:26:24.294 --> 06:26:25.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WEBSITE FOR THEIR LOCAL

06:26:25.562 --> 06:26:26.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOVERNMENT TO SEE WHAT THEY PAY

06:26:26.930 --> 06:26:28.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR POLICE AND FIRE TO SEE HOW

06:26:28.565 --> 06:26:30.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY NEGOTIATE THOSE TO SEE WHAT

06:26:30.867 --> 06:26:32.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TEACHERS ARE PAID AND HOW WOULD

06:26:32.269 --> 06:26:33.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ADMINISTRATORS ARE PAID. WE

06:26:33.737 --> 06:26:35.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DON'T ALLOW THE FREE MARKET TO

06:26:35.238 --> 06:26:37.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DECIDE WHAT ADMINISTRATORS IN

06:26:37.407 --> 06:26:39.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS OR IN

06:26:40.043 --> 06:26:42.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE PAID.

06:26:42.112 --> 06:26:43.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE WE CONSIDER THAT TO BE

06:26:43.380 --> 06:26:44.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TOO IMPORTANT TO LEAVE UP TO THE

06:26:44.314 --> 06:26:44.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
FREE MARKET.

06:26:44.881 --> 06:26:46.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

06:26:46.716 --> 06:26:48.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE NEED TO BE WILLING TO DO

06:26:48.518 --> 06:26:50.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT ON ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH

06:26:50.453 --> 06:26:51.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
CARE WHICH IS EXTREMELY

06:26:51.321 --> 06:26:52.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DIFFERENT FROM WHO WE DO NOW IN

06:26:52.656 --> 06:26:54.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
VERY DISRUPTIVE AND VERY

06:26:54.124 --> 06:26:55.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DIFFICULT TO GET TO. LET'S BE

06:26:55.926 --> 06:26:57.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HONEST LAST YEAR WE HAD A BILL

06:26:57.861 --> 06:26:58.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
JUST FOR TRANSPARENCY IN DRUG

06:26:58.461 --> 06:27:00.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
PRICING

06:27:00.096 --> 06:27:02.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT BARELY GOT THROUGH THIS

06:27:02.198 --> 06:27:03.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEGISLATURE SO THIS IS A HUGE

06:27:04.034 --> 06:27:06.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TASK TO DO THIS ALL ACROSS.

06:27:06.636 --> 06:27:08.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE SPECTRUM OF HEALTH CARE BUT

06:27:08.405 --> 06:27:10.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY.

SALARIES KIND WHERE THEY ARE

YOU KNOW THAT ALL HAS TO BE ON

06:27:33.597 --> 06:27:35.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

06:27:35.131 --> 06:27:36.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S DONE EVERYWHERE ELSE AND IF

06:27:36.766 --> 06:27:38.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU HAVE ONE GROUP THAT CAN KIND

06:27:38.668 --> 06:27:39.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF CHARGE WHAT THEY WANT THEM

06:27:39.669 --> 06:27:40.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE NEXT GROUP'S GONNA WANT TO

06:27:40.804 --> 06:27:41.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CHARGE WHAT THEY WANT IN THE

06:27:41.605 --> 06:27:43.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEXT GROUP. SO THIS IS I'M I'M

06:27:43.506 --> 06:27:45.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SAYING THIS ONLY TO REMIND YOU

06:27:45.208 --> 06:27:46.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW WHICH IS

06:27:46.242 --> 06:27:47.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THIS IS A FUNDAMENTALLY

06:27:47.544 --> 06:27:48.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT

06:27:48.979 --> 06:27:49.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTH CARE THEN WE'VE DONE IT

06:27:49.779 --> 06:27:51.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT I THINK. WE REALLY HAVE TO

06:27:51.548 --> 06:27:52.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DO IT BECAUSE WITH THE OTHER

06:27:52.849 --> 06:27:54.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THING THAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE

06:27:54.084 --> 06:27:55.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CURRENT SYSTEM JUST DOESN'T WORK

06:27:55.552 --> 06:27:57.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK IT DOESN'T

06:27:57.587 --> 06:27:59.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CONTAIN COSTS. IT DOESN'T

06:27:59.389 --> 06:28:00.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
DELIVER.

06:28:00.290 --> 06:28:02.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CARE WELL AND I DO THINK THAT

06:28:02.258 --> 06:28:03.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SINGLE PAYER IS THE GOAL BECAUSE

06:28:03.893 --> 06:28:06.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT SEEMS TO BE THE BEST WAY TO.

06:28:06.463 --> 06:28:07.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
UTILIZE THAT.

06:28:07.597 --> 06:28:10.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ABILITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO.

06:28:10.166 --> 06:28:12.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONTROL COSTS AND NEGOTIATE ITS

06:28:12.469 --> 06:28:14.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ELEGANT IT'S MORE SIMPLE.

06:28:14.270 --> 06:28:15.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:28:15.672 --> 06:28:16.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY IT'S

06:28:16.239 --> 06:28:17.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANOTHER PLACES BUT IT SEEMS TO

06:28:17.540 --> 06:28:19.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
BE THE ONE THAT.

06:28:19.109 --> 06:28:21.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE.

06:28:21.444 --> 06:28:23.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COST

06:28:23.647 --> 06:28:24.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONTAINMENT TO WE TALK YOU KNOW

06:28:24.881 --> 06:28:25.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHEN PEOPLE MENTION WASTE AND

06:28:25.982 --> 06:28:27.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALL OF THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY

06:28:27.317 --> 06:28:27.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TALKING ABOUT IS SOMEBODY'S

06:28:27.884 --> 06:28:28.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROFITS.

06:28:28.985 --> 06:28:31.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMEONE'S JOB AND THOSE PEOPLE

06:28:31.254 --> 06:28:32.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE GOING TO FIGHT BACK KNOWS A

06:28:33.023 --> 06:28:34.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOT OF THEM WITH IT GOT A LOT OF

06:28:34.124 --> 06:28:36.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MONEY SO ALL OF US WHO WANT TO

06:28:36.660 --> 06:28:37.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DO THIS HAVE TO REALIZE THAT

06:28:37.494 --> 06:28:38.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE

06:28:38.862 --> 06:28:40.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOMETHING EASIER SIMPLE. THAT'S

06:28:40.563 --> 06:28:41.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT'S

06:28:41.564 --> 06:28:43.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOING TO BE A HUGE FIGHT AND

06:28:43.700 --> 06:28:45.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

06:28:45.235 --> 06:28:46.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
AS YOU ALL KNOW.

06:28:46.302 --> 06:28:49.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:28:49.172 --> 06:28:50.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SORRY I DIDN'T REALLY I DID

06:28:50.340 --> 06:28:52.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WRITE A SPEECH USER DOES NOTES

06:28:52.542 --> 06:28:53.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ARM.

06:28:54.010 --> 06:28:55.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THERE'S A LOT OF THEM HERE.

06:28:55.111 --> 06:28:57.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

06:28:57.847 --> 06:28:59.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE DO I THINK NEED A ROADMAP

06:28:59.783 --> 06:29:01.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT BUILDS ON THE GOALS OF FIVE

06:29:01.351 --> 06:29:02.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SIX TWO.

06:29:02.485 --> 06:29:04.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW IT'S A GREAT STATEMENT

06:29:04.387 --> 06:29:05.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF PRINCIPLES IT'S A GREAT

06:29:05.555 --> 06:29:07.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STATEMENT OF VALUES BUT FLUSHING

06:29:07.123 --> 06:29:08.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS OUT INTO A COMPREHENSIVE

06:29:08.358 --> 06:29:10.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SYSTEM IS GOING TO TAKE TIME.

06:29:10.827 --> 06:29:11.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

06:29:11.261 --> 06:29:13.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

06:29:13.196 --> 06:29:14.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO REALLY

06:29:14.230 --> 06:29:15.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
START DOING.

06:29:15.699 --> 06:29:17.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REALIZING THAT WE DO NEED THAT

06:29:17.400 --> 06:29:19.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ROADMAP WE NEEDED TO BE IN PLACE

06:29:19.269 --> 06:29:20.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AT THE TIME WHEN WE HAVE A.

06:29:20.704 --> 06:29:22.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S

06:29:22.405 --> 06:29:24.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POSITION TO GIVE US THE WAIVERS

06:29:24.140 --> 06:29:25.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

06:29:28.044 --> 06:29:28.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THIS IS A ROADMAP THAT'S

06:29:29.045 --> 06:29:29.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACHIEVABLE IN STEPS IN THERE'S A

06:29:29.913 --> 06:29:31.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IS

06:29:31.514 --> 06:29:32.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
WE GET THERE.

06:29:32.816 --> 06:29:35.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN COVERING ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS

06:29:35.552 --> 06:29:36.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHETHER THEY'RE DOCUMENTED OR

NOT IN MAKING SURE WE HAVE COST

06:29:38.688 --> 06:29:40.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CONTAINMENT TO GIVE RELIEF.

06:29:40.356 --> 06:29:42.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TO FILL IN THE GAPS WHERE

MODEL I'M FOR THE REST OF THE

06:30:14.924 --> 06:30:17.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
COUNTRY I'M AYE I THINK

06:30:17.093 --> 06:30:17.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EVERYBODY WHO DIDN'T SEE IT.

06:30:17.894 --> 06:30:19.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
IT'S EVERYBODY

06:30:20.029 --> 06:30:20.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I DIDN'T WATCH THE OTHER

06:30:20.730 --> 06:30:22.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEARINGS PARTICULARLY THE LAST

06:30:22.632 --> 06:30:24.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEARING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE

06:30:24.267 --> 06:30:26.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE NEED TO WATCH THAT BECAUSE

06:30:26.436 --> 06:30:27.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE ALL HAVE TO BE MINDFUL THERE

06:30:27.971 --> 06:30:29.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MAY VERY WELL BE BALLOT MEASURES

06:30:29.506 --> 06:30:31.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT ARE NECESSARY I YOU KNOW WE

06:30:31.374 --> 06:30:32.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HEARD THE LEGAL EXPERTS SAY

06:30:32.375 --> 06:30:33.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO. HAVE

06:30:33.510 --> 06:30:35.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO HAPPEN AND WE CANNOT IGNORE

06:30:35.578 --> 06:30:36.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WE DON'T TO BE TIED UP IN

06:30:36.679 --> 06:30:38.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LITIGATION FOR YEARS TRYING TO

06:30:40.683 --> 06:30:42.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU KNOW I I THIS IS THE MOST

06:30:42.852 --> 06:30:44.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS

06:30:44.120 --> 06:30:44.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK THAT ANY OF US CAN DO

06:30:44.954 --> 06:30:46.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHILE WE'RE UP HERE. I MEAN IF

06:53:01.156 --> 06:53:02.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT MY BIGGEST QUESTION TO YOU

06:53:02.724 --> 06:53:05.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
UP THERE IS WHY NOT.

06:53:05.293 --> 06:53:06.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM SHOULD

06:53:06.528 --> 06:53:07.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE HEALTHCARE ON A PARITY WITH

06:53:07.929 --> 06:53:09.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
WHAT I HAVE.

06:53:09.631 --> 06:53:10.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE HAVE OTHER LOCALS THAT DON'T

06:53:10.932 --> 06:53:12.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW THEY

06:53:12.234 --> 06:53:13.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
HAVE TO PAY.

06:53:13.869 --> 06:53:15.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ONE IS THEY MAKE THIRTEEN

06:53:15.103 --> 06:53:16.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
DOLLARS AN HOUR.

06:53:16.805 --> 06:53:18.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THEN THEY PAY THREE HUNDRED

06:53:18.073 --> 06:53:19.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DOLLARS IN A COLD PAID THREE

06:53:19.641 --> 06:53:21.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HUNDRED A MONTH SO THEY'RE DOWN

06:53:21.376 --> 06:53:21.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ELEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR TO LIVE

06:53:21.977 --> 06:53:23.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
ON.

06:53:23.111 --> 06:53:24.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEM IN THEIR FAMILY WHY CAN'T

06:53:24.446 --> 06:53:26.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
WE DO BETTER.

06:53:26.348 --> 06:53:28.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
WHY CAN'T WE TAKE THE MONEY
THAT?

06:53:28.984 --> 06:53:31.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MY LOCAL IS SPENDING ON HEALTH

06:53:31.419 --> 06:53:32.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CARE BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THE

06:53:32.287 --> 06:53:34.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
NEGOTIATIONS.

06:53:34.322 --> 06:53:36.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEN PUT IT BACK INTO WAGES AND

06:53:36.892 --> 06:53:38.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PENSION AND BACK INTO THE

06:53:38.226 --> 06:53:39.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ECONOMY.

06:53:39.995 --> 06:53:40.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND YOU SIT UP THERE AND SAY

06:53:40.996 --> 06:53:43.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT SURE HOW

06:53:43.098 --> 06:53:44.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD DO THE MONEY THIS IS THE

06:53:44.566 --> 06:53:46.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SIXTH OR EIGHTH I'M NOT SURE

06:53:46.234 --> 06:53:47.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH ONE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

06:53:47.969 --> 06:53:49.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
WORLD.

06:53:49.704 --> 06:53:50.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND YOU GUYS CAN'T FIGURE THAT

06:53:50.305 --> 06:53:52.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%

YEARS.

06:54:21.336 --> 06:54:22.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'VE HEARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

06:54:22.604 --> 06:54:24.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
INCREMENTALISM. AND.

06:54:25.006 --> 06:54:26.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
AND ALSO.

06:54:26.841 --> 06:54:28.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE BY WAY OF

06:54:28.310 --> 06:54:29.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEALTH INSURANCE AND THAT'S NOT

06:54:29.444 --> 06:54:31.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THE ANSWER.

06:54:32.047 --> 06:54:33.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INSURANCE IS NOT HEALTH CARE.

06:54:34.049 --> 06:54:35.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE KNOW THAT AND I'LL TELL YOU A

06:54:35.617 --> 06:54:36.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LITTLE STORY AND I KNOW YOU'VE

06:54:41.990 --> 06:54:44.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT NURSE WORK VERY HARD.

06:54:44.859 --> 06:54:46.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
GOT A CANCER DIAGNOSIS.

06:54:46.895 --> 06:54:48.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND EXCEEDED THE TREATMENT. TIME

06:54:48.997 --> 06:54:52.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO THE HOSPITAL FIRED HER.

06:54:52.634 --> 06:54:53.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE IS A BREAK IN TREATMENT

06:54:53.668 --> 06:54:55.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND THAT NURSE PASSED AWAY.

06:54:55.937 --> 06:54:57.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME

06:54:57.172 --> 06:54:59.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT'S PERSONAL TO ME.

07:02:13.007 --> 07:02:15.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GENTLEMEN THIS IS A HEAVY LIFT.

07:02:15.576 --> 07:02:16.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT'S A HEAVY LIFT AND WILL

07:02:16.844 --> 07:02:19.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REQUIRE OUR MORAL STRENGTH.

07:02:19.447 --> 07:02:22.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHEN I WAS DRIVING OVER ON ONE

07:02:22.083 --> 07:02:24.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF THE OVERPASSES WAS TO SIGN

07:02:24.719 --> 07:02:26.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
WHAT WOULD MLK DO.

07:02:26.921 --> 07:02:28.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE JUST RECENTLY CELEBRATED THE

07:02:28.790 --> 07:02:29.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MEMORY OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER

07:02:29.657 --> 07:02:31.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KING AS APPROPRIATE THAT WE'RE

07:02:31.259 --> 07:02:32.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TALKING ABOUT THIS NOW. BECAUSE

07:02:32.960 --> 07:02:34.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE FIGHT FOR HEALTHCARE

07:02:34.128 --> 07:02:36.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EQUALITY IS THE FIGHT FOR SOCIAL

07:02:36.964 --> 07:02:38.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EQUALITY IT IS THE FIGHT FOR

07:02:39.033 --> 07:02:40.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ECONOMIC EQUALITY IT IS THE

07:02:40.935 --> 07:02:43.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FIGHT. FOR RACIAL EQUALITY

07:02:43.171 --> 07:02:44.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND YEARS FROM NOW IT WILL BE

07:02:44.839 --> 07:02:46.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
ASKED OF US

07:02:46.441 --> 07:02:48.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WERE WE DOING WHEN MILLIONS

07:02:48.643 --> 07:02:50.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WERE

07:02:50.078 --> 07:02:52.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SUFFERING WITHOUT HEALTHCARE.

07:02:52.380 --> 07:02:52.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THIS

07:02:53.014 --> 07:02:54.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
DEBATE

07:02:54.182 --> 07:02:55.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO PRIORITIZE THE VOICES OF THE

07:02:55.717 --> 07:02:57.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
NURSES

07:02:57.452 --> 07:02:58.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS

07:02:58.619 --> 07:03:00.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
BROKEN SYSTEM.

07:03:00.321 --> 07:03:02.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY KNOW THE FACES BEHIND THE

07:03:02.356 --> 07:03:04.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NUMBERS THEY KNOW THE STORIES

07:03:04.192 --> 07:03:05.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BEHIND THE STATISTICS.

07:03:05.560 --> 07:03:07.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
AND

07:03:07.328 --> 07:03:09.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO UNDERLINE THE URGENCY OF THIS

07:03:09.397 --> 07:03:11.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MOMENT IT CAN'T BE DONE ENOUGH.

07:03:11.299 --> 07:03:12.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EVERYDAY WE LET THIS CRISIS

07:03:12.233 --> 07:03:14.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
CONTINUE.

07:03:14.135 --> 07:03:15.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT'S ANOTHER NEIGHBOR GONE.

07:03:15.937 --> 07:03:17.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER GONE.

07:03:17.638 --> 07:03:18.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
IT'S ANOTHER CHILD

07:03:18.506 --> 07:03:20.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
GONE.

07:03:21.008 --> 07:03:23.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO

07:03:23.411 --> 07:03:24.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HONOR THE LEGACY OF DR MARTIN

07:03:24.846 --> 07:03:26.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
LUTHER KING.

07:03:26.414 --> 07:03:28.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEN TWO FORWARD TO ADVOCATE TO

07:03:28.483 --> 07:03:30.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
FIGHT.

07:03:30.218 --> 07:03:32.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PASS S. B. FIVE SIX TWO.

07:03:32.687 --> 07:03:34.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PLEASE BE LEADERS IN THAT FIGHT

07:03:34.922 --> 07:03:40.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THANK YOU.

07:03:40.194 --> 07:03:43.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
SIR.

07:03:43.197 --> 07:03:45.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
GOOD AFTERNOON.

07:03:45.833 --> 07:03:47.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MY NAME IS THE LORD STERN HELIO.

07:03:47.101 --> 07:03:48.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I BEEN A REGISTERED NURSE FOR

07:03:48.903 --> 07:03:50.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EIGHTEEN YEARS AND I WORK IN A

07:03:50.271 --> 07:03:53.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT.

07:03:53.674 --> 07:03:55.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE HERE'S TO CRITICISM. THAT S.

07:03:55.810 --> 07:03:58.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
B. BY SIXTY TWO CANNOT PROCEED.

07:03:58.613 --> 07:04:00.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE ALL OF THE DETAILS HAVE

07:04:00.681 --> 07:04:01.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT BEEN SPELLED OUT AHEAD OF

07:04:01.983 --> 07:04:03.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
TIME.

07:04:03.184 --> 07:04:05.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THIS IS WRONG.

07:04:05.686 --> 07:04:07.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT FOR THE ABSENCE OF POLITICAL

07:04:07.188 --> 07:04:09.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WELL AND LEADERSHIP IN THE

07:04:09.590 --> 07:04:12.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ASSEMBLY. THE DETAILS IN ANY

07:04:12.493 --> 07:04:14.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ALLEGED DEFICIENCIES.

07:04:14.428 --> 07:04:15.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT BY

07:04:15.229 --> 07:04:17.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
NOW.

07:04:17.765 --> 07:04:20.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SINGLE PAYER GUARANTEED

07:04:20.067 --> 07:04:22.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. IS AN IDEA

07:04:22.637 --> 07:04:25.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
WHOSE TIME HAS COME.

07:04:25.106 --> 07:04:27.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT REQUIRES OUR BASS THINKING.

07:04:27.875 --> 07:04:30.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOW IS NOT THE TIME. TO STOP

07:04:30.745 --> 07:04:33.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
BEFORE WE START.

07:04:33.247 --> 07:04:35.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IDEAS MATTER AND THIS IDEA IS

07:04:35.550 --> 07:04:37.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SUPPORTED. BY THE VAST MAJORITY

07:04:37.652 --> 07:04:39.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
OF DEMOCRATS

07:04:39.520 --> 07:04:41.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

07:04:41.722 --> 07:04:43.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.

07:04:43.457 --> 07:04:45.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
IDEAS MATTER.

07:04:45.493 --> 07:04:47.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THE EMBRACE OF IMPORTANT

07:04:47.094 --> 07:04:49.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IDEAS BY THOSE IN POSITIONS OF

07:04:49.197 --> 07:04:50.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
LEADERSHIP.

07:04:50.765 --> 07:04:53.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS HOW GREAT THINGS HOW GREAT

07:04:53.634 --> 07:04:55.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THINGS ARE ACCOMPLISHED.

07:04:55.803 --> 07:04:58.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GONE ARE THE DAYS OF POLITICIANS

07:04:58.239 --> 07:05:00.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHO CLAIM TO SUPPORT GUARANTEED

07:05:00.474 --> 07:05:02.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. OR THAT

07:05:02.810 --> 07:05:04.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT.

07:05:05.046 --> 07:05:08.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT WHO SIMULTANEOUSLY ATTACK

07:05:08.282 --> 07:05:09.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE ONLY BILL BEFORE THE

07:05:09.617 --> 07:05:11.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
LEGISLATURE.

07:05:11.185 --> 07:05:12.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WOULD GUARANTEE HEALTH CARE

07:05:12.820 --> 07:05:15.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
FOR ALL. AND IN FACT

07:05:15.089 --> 07:05:17.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
MAKE IT A HUMAN RIGHT.

07:05:17.792 --> 07:05:20.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

THAT AS BUSINESSES WE SHARE MANY

07:30:31.571 --> 07:30:32.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

07:30:33.005 --> 07:30:34.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GRASSROOTS ACTIVISTS BECAUSE

07:30:34.073 --> 07:30:36.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHAT WE'RE SEEING. IS THAT

07:30:36.109 --> 07:30:37.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
HEALTH INSURANCE.

07:30:37.243 --> 07:30:38.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%

07:30:39.045 --> 07:30:41.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PART EATING AWAY AT OUR ABILITY

PEOPLE IN BUSINESS ARE GETTING

07:30:46.753 --> 07:30:49.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ANGRIER AND ANGRIER ABOUT WHERE

07:30:49.088 --> 07:30:50.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THINGS HAD GONE BECAUSE THE

07:30:50.556 --> 07:30:52.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

UPS YOU HAVE THE HIGH COST.

07:30:54.260 --> 07:30:56.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THE ISSUE OF

07:30:56.429 --> 07:30:58.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LACK OF RECOGNITION OF WHAT OUR

07:30:58.364 --> 07:30:58.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
NEW ECONOMY.

07:30:58.898 --> 07:31:00.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
IS DOING.

07:31:00.833 --> 07:31:02.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE BEING

07:31:02.835 --> 07:31:04.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FORCED INTO THE SO CALLED GIG

07:31:05.037 --> 07:31:06.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ECONOMY WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT

07:31:06.839 --> 07:31:08.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABOUT THAT BUT HOW ARE THESE

07:31:08.274 --> 07:31:10.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
FOLKS.

07:31:10.710 --> 07:31:11.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHETHER THEY'RE ENTREPRENEURS

07:31:11.310 --> 07:31:12.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ARE NOT.

07:31:12.678 --> 07:31:15.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOING TO SURVIVE IN AN ECONOMY

07:31:15.715 --> 07:31:18.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHERE THEY DO NOT HAVE READY

07:31:18.584 --> 07:31:21.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE.

07:31:21.320 --> 07:31:22.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE TO REALLY

07:31:22.822 --> 07:31:24.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
LOOK.

07:31:24.424 --> 07:31:26.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AT THIS ISSUE WHO WON UNLEASH

07:31:26.359 --> 07:31:28.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS IN THE

07:31:28.127 --> 07:31:29.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
STATE I THINK ONE OF THE

07:31:29.662 --> 07:31:31.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INNOVATIVE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO

07:31:32.064 --> 07:31:35.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS UNTIE.

07:31:35.835 --> 07:31:38.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE QUESTION OF HEALTH INSURANCE

07:31:38.671 --> 07:31:41.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTH ACCESS FROM EMPLOYMENT.

07:31:41.073 --> 07:31:43.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I DON'T SEE WHERE AT THIS POINT

07:31:43.309 --> 07:31:44.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IT REALLY

07:31:44.944 --> 07:31:46.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IS VERY USEFUL.

07:31:46.579 --> 07:31:48.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AS A SYSTEM IT HAS NOT WORKED

07:31:48.748 --> 07:31:50.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR A LONG TIME AND I THINK IF

07:31:51.050 --> 07:31:52.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE WANT TO GROW THIS ECONOMY. WE

07:31:52.952 --> 07:31:54.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BE WELL SERVED UNDERSTAND

07:31:54.787 --> 07:31:56.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUSINESS CAN PAY ITS RIGHTFUL

07:31:56.989 --> 07:31:59.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SHARE OF HEALTH COSTS BUT LET'S

07:31:59.292 --> 07:32:02.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT CONTINUE SADDLING BUSINESS

FOR A NATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM.

07:34:10.623 --> 07:34:12.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AN ORGANIZATION FOUNDED THIRTY

07:34:12.358 --> 07:34:14.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FIVE YEARS AGO. TO FOCUS SOLELY

07:34:14.827 --> 07:34:16.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SINGLE

07:34:16.495 --> 07:34:19.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PAYER. WE DO RESEARCH WE DO

07:34:19.265 --> 07:34:21.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ADVOCACY AND WE DO EDUCATION.

07:34:21.968 --> 07:34:23.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S REALLY GRATIFYING TO HAVE

07:34:23.536 --> 07:34:25.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEARD SINGLE PAYER MENTIONED SO

07:34:25.171 --> 07:34:28.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
MANY TIMES DURING THESE
HEARINGS.

07:34:28.107 --> 07:34:29.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BY THE AUDIENCE BY THE WITNESSES

07:34:30.009 --> 07:34:31.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AND BY THE COMMITTEE.

07:34:31.777 --> 07:34:35.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I HAVE TO SAY AS A STUDENT. OF

07:34:35.548 --> 07:34:38.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SINGLE PAYER FOR MANY DECADES.

07:34:38.117 --> 07:34:39.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LACK

07:34:39.251 --> 07:34:40.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF UNDERSTANDING OF REALLY WHAT

07:34:41.053 --> 07:34:42.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
SINGLE PAYER IS.

07:34:42.888 --> 07:34:44.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE GETS

07:34:44.390 --> 07:34:45.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A GRADE OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SHE

07:34:45.725 --> 07:34:47.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
PLUS AND THE MINUS.

07:34:47.460 --> 07:34:49.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT DON'T BE DISCOURAGED YOU'RE

07:34:49.362 --> 07:34:50.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALL SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND

07:34:50.963 --> 07:34:52.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT BUT YOU NEED TO KEEP STUDYING

07:34:52.264 --> 07:34:53.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IT.

07:34:53.799 --> 07:34:56.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE ASKED TO TESTIFY AND WE WERE

07:34:56.102 --> 07:34:58.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARE POLITELY REJECTED BUT I

07:34:58.304 --> 07:35:00.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINK THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE A

07:35:00.339 --> 07:35:02.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RESOURCE TO THE COMMITTEE SO

07:35:02.141 --> 07:35:03.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT YOU TRULY UNDERSTAND SINGLE

07:35:03.643 --> 07:35:06.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PAYER POLICY FOR EXAMPLE.

07:35:06.445 --> 07:35:08.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE TALK ABOUT COST CONTROL

07:35:08.114 --> 07:35:11.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SINGLE PAYER IS COST CONTROL.

07:35:11.484 --> 07:35:13.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
IT'S SETTING PRICES.

07:35:13.386 --> 07:35:15.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND IT'S SETTING A BUDGET.

07:35:15.121 --> 07:35:16.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEN IT'S RUNNING A HEALTH

07:35:16.455 --> 07:35:17.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CARE SYSTEM ON BEHALF OF THE

07:35:17.790 --> 07:35:19.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PUBLIC AS CUSTODIANS OF THEIR

07:35:19.191 --> 07:35:21.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
MONEY.

07:35:21.260 --> 07:35:22.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND STAYING WITHIN BUDGET.

07:35:23.062 --> 07:35:24.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
IT'S VERY EASY TO DO

07:35:24.630 --> 07:35:27.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONCEPTUALLY I'M NOT SAYING IT'S

07:35:27.299 --> 07:35:28.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EASY TO DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

07:35:28.567 --> 07:35:30.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THE LAST COMMENT IS ABOUT THE

07:35:30.736 --> 07:35:32.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TWO TRACKS THAT THE COMMITTEE

07:35:32.238 --> 07:35:34.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INVASIONS AT LEAST SOME OF THE

07:35:34.373 --> 07:35:35.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMMITTEE MEMBERS ENVISIONED

07:35:35.741 --> 07:35:37.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
WORKING ON.

07:35:37.109 --> 07:35:39.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE OF THOSE TRACKS CONTINUES TO

07:35:39.145 --> 07:35:40.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BE INCREMENTAL REFORM AND I'M

07:35:40.613 --> 07:35:41.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NOT OPPOSED TO INCREMENTAL

07:35:41.414 --> 07:35:42.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
REFORM.

07:35:42.848 --> 07:35:44.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP OUR

07:35:44.216 --> 07:35:45.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ATTENTION ON THE OTHER TRACK

07:35:45.551 --> 07:35:47.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE THE OTHER TRACK LEASE TO

07:35:47.219 --> 07:35:48.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT

07:35:48.688 --> 07:35:50.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ANTHONY WRIGHT TALKED ABOUT.

07:35:50.322 --> 07:35:52.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE INCREMENTAL REFORM TRACK

07:35:52.291 --> 07:35:54.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEADS FROM ONE OBSTACLE TO THE

07:35:54.193 --> 07:35:55.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEXT OBSTACLE TO THE NAFT NEXT

07:35:55.995 --> 07:35:58.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OBSTACLE. IT WAS CHARACTERIZED

07:35:58.631 --> 07:36:00.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DECADES AGO AS BILLIONS FOR

07:36:00.700 --> 07:36:03.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BANDAIDS AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS

07:36:03.202 --> 07:36:05.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S VERY HONORABLE. TO TAKE OUT

07:36:05.304 --> 07:36:07.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A BANDAID AND PUT IT ON A LOOM.

07:36:07.907 --> 07:36:09.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE

07:36:10.042 --> 07:36:11.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROBLEM WE NEED A TRANSFORMATION

07:36:11.444 --> 07:36:13.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

07:36:13.212 --> 07:36:15.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO I HOPE THAT YOU'LL TAKE

07:36:15.181 --> 07:36:16.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADVANTAGE OF OUR OPPORTUNITY TO

TIGHT TIMELINES FOR ACTION IN

08:17:47.904 --> 08:17:50.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE SENATE. IN THE IN THE YEAH

08:17:50.073 --> 08:17:51.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IN THE SENATE IT WAS NOT

FINANCING PROPOSAL BEFORE THE

08:17:54.945 --> 08:17:56.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SENATE BUT IT WAS FULLY OUR

08:17:56.580 --> 08:17:58.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
INTENT TO INCLUDE FINANCIAL

08:17:58.381 --> 08:18:00.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PROPOSAL. AS THE BILL WAS

08:18:00.183 --> 08:18:01.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONSIDERED AN AMENDED IN THE

08:18:01.885 --> 08:18:04.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ASSEMBLY. IN FACT THE SPEAKER'S

08:18:04.287 --> 08:18:08.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OWN STAFF MEMBER TOLD CNA NOT TO

08:18:08.091 --> 08:18:09.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PUT THE FINANCING IN THE BILL

08:18:09.859 --> 08:18:10.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNTIL IT GOT TO THE PROCREATION

08:18:11.995 --> 08:18:14.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMITTEE AND THEN THE SPEAKER.

08:18:15.065 --> 08:18:15.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FROZE THE BILL IN THE RULES

08:18:16.032 --> 08:18:17.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
COMMITTEE.

08:18:17.500 --> 08:18:20.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IS A TRULY DISINGENUOUS WAY

08:18:20.570 --> 08:18:21.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
TO DEAL WITH US

08:18:21.404 --> 08:18:23.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THE PUBLIC

08:18:23.173 --> 08:18:25.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TELL A BILL SPONSOR NOT TO PUT

08:18:25.141 --> 08:18:27.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FINANCING IN THE BILL UNTIL MUCH

08:18:27.143 --> 08:18:28.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LATER IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

08:18:28.712 --> 08:18:30.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY FREEZE THE

08:18:30.480 --> 08:18:32.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BILL. PREVENTING THE FINANCING

08:18:32.449 --> 08:18:34.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEING PUT IN THE BILL AND THEN

08:18:34.551 --> 08:18:36.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DISHONESTLY CLAIMED THAT THE

08:18:36.253 --> 08:18:38.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BILL IS IN ADEQUATE BECAUSE IT

08:18:38.655 --> 08:18:40.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAS NO FINANCING UNIT. YOU ARE

08:18:40.657 --> 08:18:42.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND NOT ON

08:18:51.601 --> 08:18:53.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DEMOCRATICALLY BOTTLED UP YOU

SAY YOU BELIEVE IN HEALTHCARE IS

08:18:55.772 --> 08:18:57.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
A RIGHT.

08:18:57.440 --> 08:18:59.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE DEFINITION OF A RIGHT IS

08:18:59.109 --> 08:19:00.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMETHING THAT'S MORAL ETHICAL

08:19:01.011 --> 08:19:02.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
AND JOTS.

08:19:03.013 --> 08:19:05.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%

AND HE KNOWS HOW TO BUDGET IS SO

ON THEIR.

08:20:05.075 --> 08:20:06.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE IS

08:20:07.010 --> 08:20:09.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER PER CAPITA

08:20:09.212 --> 08:20:11.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAN ON THE CURRENT SYSTEM.

08:20:11.681 --> 08:20:14.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOW I I DON'T KNOW WHO LOSES

08:20:14.084 --> 08:20:15.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHEN YOU TAKE OUT THE COSTS I'M

08:20:15.652 --> 08:20:17.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT. THAT MUCH OF AN EXPERT BUT.

08:20:17.387 --> 08:20:19.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

08:20:19.356 --> 08:20:21.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IF YOU LOOK AT ITALY.

08:20:21.424 --> 08:20:22.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
FOR EXAMPLE.

08:20:22.792 --> 08:20:25.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PULLING UP THE STATISTIC HERE.

08:20:25.495 --> 08:20:27.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY SPEND ABOUT THREE THOUSAND

08:20:27.497 --> 08:20:30.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TWO HUNDRED PER CAPITA FOR TOTAL

08:20:30.100 --> 08:20:31.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WE SPEND

08:20:31.234 --> 08:20:32.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

08:20:32.902 --> 08:20:34.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CAPITA UNITED STATES ALMOST

08:20:34.104 --> 08:20:35.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THREE TIMES MORE FOR ONLY SOME

08:20:35.839 --> 08:20:37.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PEOPLE HAVE PERFECT COVERAGE I

08:20:37.307 --> 08:20:38.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MEAN NO ONE HAS UNIVERSAL

08:20:38.875 --> 08:20:39.743 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
COVERAGE IN THE UNITED STATES
SO.

08:20:39.809 --> 08:20:41.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
BUT IT.

08:20:41.911 --> 08:20:42.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I GUESS SOMEONE TIME HERE.

08:20:42.912 --> 08:20:45.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I DID NOTICE SOME THINGS THAT I

08:20:45.782 --> 08:20:47.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINK OR NEED TO BE LOOKED AT

08:20:47.851 --> 08:20:49.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
WITH THIS WHICH IS.

08:20:49.652 --> 08:20:51.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WORDEN DOT SAME RING TO COVER

08:20:51.187 --> 08:20:51.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
PEOPLE IN THE TRAVEL

08:20:51.955 --> 08:20:53.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INTERNATIONALLY WITH THIS THE I

08:20:53.690 --> 08:20:55.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SAW AND OF SO THAT WOULD BE A

08:20:55.358 --> 08:20:57.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOWNGRADE SO THAT NEEDS I THINK

08:20:57.327 --> 08:20:58.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
COVERAGE.

08:20:58.428 --> 08:21:00.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.

08:21:00.163 --> 08:21:02.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

08:21:02.265 --> 08:21:03.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE WE GOING TO USE THIS FOR

08:21:03.600 --> 08:21:04.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOME TYPE A GUN CONTROL THING

08:21:05.034 --> 08:21:07.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHICH I'D BE AGAINST PERSONALLY

08:21:07.103 --> 08:21:08.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE I I JUST CAN'T MAKE THEM

08:21:08.538 --> 08:21:10.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FRENCH CANADA HERE BUT. SO I I

08:21:10.440 --> 08:21:11.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN I

08:21:11.775 --> 08:21:12.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK CALIFORNIA'S ON THE TORIES

08:21:13.009 --> 08:21:14.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR GUN CONTROL LIKE IT TO SEE
