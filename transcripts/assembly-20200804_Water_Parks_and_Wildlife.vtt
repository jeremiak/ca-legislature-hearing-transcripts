ONCE TO BE TO SOME OF THE

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:42.543
FACILITY IN BILLS. I AND MY SEC

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:44.479
QUESTION IS HOW IS THIS COVERT

01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:47.882
RELATED- SCIENCE HAS INDICATED

01:29:47.949 --> 01:29:49.517
THAT COLD IT WAS TRANSMITTED BY

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:52.353
HUMANS TO. ANIMALS AT I SEE THE

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:53.588
COURT IN BETWEEN THE COVERT

01:29:53.654 --> 01:29:55.490
RELATED WE WERE UNDER A LOT OF

01:29:55.556 --> 01:30:00.261
PRESSURE RIGHT NOW TO. TO LOOK

01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:02.797
AT CODE RELATED- BILLS DON'T

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:05.967
SEE THE CORRELATION TO. FURTHER

01:30:06.033 --> 01:30:08.002
ELABORATE ON. OF COURSE AND I

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:09.303
WOULD HAVE DONE THAT AT THE TOP

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:11.539
I APPRECIATE. THE FACT THAT

01:30:11.606 --> 01:30:13.274
WE'VE TAKEN THIS MUCH TIME OUT

01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:15.276
OF YOUR DAY IN AND IN A TOTAL

01:30:15.343 --> 01:30:17.245
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. IS

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:18.946
ALREADY AN INDULGENT REQUIRES

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:20.748
AN EXPLANATION I APPRECIATE YOU

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:23.050
BRINGING THAT UP AND I AGREE WE

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:26.120
SHOULD BE- HI SCRUTINIZED FOR

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:28.089
EVERY SINGLE BILL WE PUT BEFORE

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:30.291
YOU AND PULL AWAY FROM- THE

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:34.529
REST THIS CRATE. TWO THINGS ONE

01:30:34.595 --> 01:30:37.532
IS I THINK THE SIGN COMPLETELY

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:40.101
SETTLED ON THE ORIGINS OF THE

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:42.537
VIRUS I KNOW ABOUT THE HUMAN

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:44.205
THE ANIMAL TRANSMISSION I KNOW

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:45.473
THERE'S STILL SOME ONGOING

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:49.010
RESEARCH THE IN TERMS OF- HOW

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:50.011
LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN LOOKING

01:30:50.077 --> 01:30:52.780
AT- THAT PAYING BILLION OR

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:56.450
OTHER- OTHER SORT OF SHE'S

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:58.586
TRANSMISSION OF THESE KIND OF

01:30:58.653 --> 01:31:01.489
NOVEL OF I REPEAT THE NOVEL

01:31:01.556 --> 01:31:04.192
INFLUENZA VIRUSES SO. I DON'T

01:31:04.258 --> 01:31:06.027
THINK IT'S- ANYTHING IT GENERAL

01:31:06.093 --> 01:31:08.663
AS WE SEE THROUGH. AB INFLUENZA

01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:10.097
A NUMBER OF THESE MAJOR PUBLIC

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:12.300
HEALTH DO NOT A TRANSMISSION IS

01:31:12.366 --> 01:31:14.068
A MAJOR RISK IT'S BEEN CITED BY

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:15.837
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION YOU

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:17.471
SEE I MEAN THIS IS NOT.

01:31:17.538 --> 01:31:19.240
SOMETHING THAT- WE SORT OF

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:22.476
CRAFTED OURSELVES TO JUSTIFY-

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:25.379
OF A PUSH HERE ON THAT ON THAT

01:31:25.446 --> 01:31:27.181
LIVE ANIMAL PIECE OF IT THAT

01:31:27.248 --> 01:31:28.683
WILDLIFE IMPORTATION DO NOT A

01:31:28.749 --> 01:31:30.284
TRADE MISSION. AS FAR AS THE

01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:31.652
TROPHY HUNTING PIECE OF THIS

01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:34.422
GOES IF YOU WANT TO CALL THAT

01:31:34.488 --> 01:31:35.690
THE- IN SUMMARY THE TROPHY

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:37.658
HUNTING P. THIS EXTINCTION

01:31:37.725 --> 01:31:39.327
EVENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO IS

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:41.062
NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR COPAYS-

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:43.664
WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:46.267
GOING TO LOSE OUR APEX SPECIES

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:49.270
AND- MATT. THEM COLLAPSE IN

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:51.772
PARALLEL TO THIS KOBE CRISIS SO

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:54.108
I DON'T THINK THAT IN ANY WAY

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:55.276
IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT THE

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:58.212
PANDEMIC AND IN FACT YOU KNOW.

01:31:58.279 --> 01:32:01.048
WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:03.951
YOU BATTLES OF THE SAME TIME

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:07.922
AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR. NO NO.

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.590
OUR TOOLS AND SAY WE'VE GOT A

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:11.926
BECAUSE ON MAGIC EVENT I THINK

01:32:11.993 --> 01:32:13.027
WE'VE GOT AT LEAST PUT THEM

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:14.161
BUILDING PLACE GET IT

01:32:14.228 --> 01:32:16.297
ENFORCEMENT ARCHITECTURE UP AND

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:18.499
KEEP MOVING SO THAT'S MY

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:20.034
ARGUMENT I APPRECIATE THE

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:21.669
YOU'VE GOT A LOT ELSE GOING ON

01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:26.474
SO AM I APOLOGIZE FOR. TODAY TO

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:28.276
PASS ISSUE FOR ME. THANK YOU. I

01:32:28.342 --> 01:32:29.777
HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS

01:32:29.844 --> 01:32:31.746
ACTUALLY. SOLD SOLD TO YOUR

01:32:31.812 --> 01:32:33.848
POINT ABOUT- THE TRANSMISSION

01:32:33.915 --> 01:32:35.283
WERE HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT

01:32:35.349 --> 01:32:36.884
TIME TRACING PEOPLE. WHO HAVE

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:39.587
BEEN INFECTED WITH COAL BID AND

01:32:39.654 --> 01:32:40.855
HOW ARE YOU PROPOSING TO TRACE

01:32:40.922 --> 01:32:43.691
ANY DOES YOUR OWN VIRUS. I FROM

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:45.793
ANIMAL TO ANIMAL I UNDERSTAND

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:48.195
THE OVERALL GOAL HOWEVER WE

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:51.866
DIDN'T FINDING COALBED- WHEN WE

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:53.534
WERE YOU KNOW WHEN IT OF

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:55.436
ORIGINATED SO HOW ARE WE

01:32:55.503 --> 01:32:57.705
PROPOSING THAT. THESE ANIMALS

01:32:57.772 --> 01:33:00.408
ARE GOING TO BE. I DO YOU'RE

01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:01.809
GONNA FIND IS DISEASES ON

01:33:01.876 --> 01:33:04.545
ANIMAL THAN SOME OF THE- HEAD

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:07.415
OF IT BEFORE IT IT HURTS PEOPLE.

01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:09.216
AND THAT SOME OF OUR EXPERTS

01:33:09.283 --> 01:33:12.453
MAY- IT WILL HAVE SOME FURTHER

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.554
LIKE MORE DETAIL WHICH

01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:15.623
UNIVERSITIES ARE DOING SOME OF

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:16.724
THE RESEARCH BUT I KNOW IT AT

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.993
LEAST. WITHIN OUR UC SYSTEM IN

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:19.927
SOME OF OUR MAJOR AGRICULTURAL

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:22.363
UNIVERSITIES AS WELL. AND

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.198
DISEASE PREVENTION AND

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:26.667
MITIGATION IS A- BIG ARE IN BE

01:33:26.734 --> 01:33:29.170
EFFORT THAT ONGOING THERE'S-

01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:31.839
BACK LABORATORY THERE ARE

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:36.077
VARIOUS PASSED LABORATORIES-

01:33:36.143 --> 01:33:37.445
THERE'S ALL KINDS. OF ONGOING

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:39.213
RESEARCH WE'RE DOING THE STATE

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.781
TO TRY TO GET AHEAD OF WHAT

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:43.451
MIGHT BE A NEW FIRE I KNOW IT

01:33:43.517 --> 01:33:44.652
THE AVIAN INFLUENZA DIFFERENCES

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:46.187
WERE STUDY WITH THE UC SYSTEM

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:48.889
IN THE SEA IS USED. SO IN

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:50.758
THEORY WE'D WE'D BE ABLE TO

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:53.394
SPOT PLEASE REGISTER EARLY AND

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:55.496
DO A LOT BETTER JOB OF.

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:59.033
MITIGATING OF ALL OUT. I WE

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:00.401
SHARE THE GOAL WITH OUR

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:01.736
PARTNERS IN THE AG. COMMUNITY

01:34:01.802 --> 01:34:03.671
TO SLICE DOCTOR AT RISK FROM

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:05.373
THESE KIND OUTBREAKS AS WELL SO

01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:06.874
I THINK THERE'S A PRETTY BIG

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:08.275
ARCHITECTURE IN THE STATE BUT-

01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:10.511
CAN I PROMISE YOU IT'LL BE.

01:34:10.578 --> 01:34:11.846
PERFECT IN WILL BE ABLE TO

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:14.081
BLOCK EVERYTHING NO NO I

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:16.450
WOULDN'T SAY THAT I THINK JUST

01:34:16.517 --> 01:34:17.284
TRYING TO PUT MORE TOOLS AND

01:34:17.351 --> 01:34:19.387
TOOL KIT. THANK YOU BYE YOU

01:34:19.453 --> 01:34:20.788
JUST BROUGHT UP ANOTHER CONCERN

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:21.789
I READ THROUGH THE BILL AND

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:23.491
PART OF THE LANGUAGE. ABOUT OUR

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:25.693
UNIVERSITIES HAVING TO APPLY

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.229
FOR PERMITS- IN ORDER TO DO WE-

01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:33.868
SOLD. FAYE I AREA KAPALI POMONA

DOES NOT I HAVE THEM IN. TWO

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:38.506
TWO APPLY SO THEN THE RESEARCH

01:34:38.572 --> 01:34:39.573
IS NOT GOING TO BE THEM. TO THE

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.442
THEY HAVE APPLIED PAY FOR THE-

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:42.877
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:44.745
RESEARCH SERVICE REQUEST

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:47.281
RESEARCHER TALKING ABOUT IS

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:50.785
GOING TO BE LIMITED. TO THOSE

01:34:50.851 --> 01:34:54.789
BOB ACTUALLY APPLYING FOR IT

OTHER. MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.328
DO RESEARCH BY MIGHT NOT BE ON

01:35:01.395 --> 01:35:03.064
THE TOP OF THE LIST SPECIAL YOU

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:06.767
ARE LOOKING ME THROUGH HER BOTH

OUT A WAY THAT WE DON'T- BIAS

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:25.019
OR HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

THE ONLY CHANGE TO THAT WOULD

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:19.039
BE ONE PROVISION REQUIRES A

01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:21.275
LEFT A VERY VERY SMALL LIST OF

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:23.010
THE MOST DANGEROUS. THE ONES

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:24.011
THAT ARE THOUGHT TO BE THE

01:36:24.078 --> 01:36:26.981
MOST- LIKELY TO BE OF CONCERN

01:36:27.047 --> 01:36:28.382
THOSE DON'T GET ADDED TO THE

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:29.950

STANDARDS TO HANDLE THE VERY

01:36:37.057 --> 01:36:38.626
VERY DANGEROUS ANIMALS BUT THE

THE BILL WAS AMENDED- I

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:10.457
COMMITTEE ORIGINALLY IS WRITTEN

01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:12.993
IT WOULD PROHIBIT IMPORT UNLESS

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.962
THAT ANIMAL COULD BE TESTED TO

01:37:15.029 --> 01:37:16.330
ENSURE THEY WERE NOT QUITE.

ARE BROUGHT IN THAT ARE TESTED

01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:29.043
TO HAVE CONCERNS CAN BE SAFELY

01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:30.878
TREATED THAT WOULD NOT ACT AS A

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:32.680
BAN. ON THE IMPORTATION OF

01:37:35.816 --> 01:37:37.451
NOT BRINGING IN ANIMALS WITHOUT

STERN FOR BRINGING THIS BACK

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:05.492
LOADED FOR- A SIMILAR BILL A

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:08.795
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND- IT AND

01:46:08.862 --> 01:46:12.165
I FIND A TROPHY HUNTING TO BE

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:14.101
MORALLY REPUGNANT- AND OF

01:46:14.167 --> 01:46:16.536
SOMETHING THAT MAKES NO SENSE

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:22.008
TO ME I DID FIND THE B. ARTICLE

01:46:22.075 --> 01:46:26.246
THIS WEEK TO BE YOU INTERESTING.

01:46:26.313 --> 01:46:30.784
AND CHALLENGING FOR. IS THAT

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:33.620
POINT AND SERVE THE POPULATIONS

01:46:33.687 --> 01:46:37.324
OF ANIMALS- ACROSS THE WORLD-

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:39.326
AND PROTECT OUR ECOSYSTEM WHERE

01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:41.461
THEY RAISE THE FACT THAT BY

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:43.563
BANNING TROPHY HUNTING WE MAY

01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:46.266
IN FACT BE CURTAILING EFFORTS

01:46:46.333 --> 01:46:48.468
TO PROTECT SPECIES BECAUSE OF

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:50.303
THE FUNDS THAT DOCOME IN TWO

01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:52.439
COUNTRIES THAT ARE DOING WELL

01:46:52.506 --> 01:46:53.907
MANAGE CONSERVATION PROGRAM

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:57.844
WITH THAT MONEY AND- AND IT IT

01:46:57.911 --> 01:46:59.846
IS SO COUNTERINTUITIVE IN VERY

01:46:59.913 --> 01:47:02.149
CHALLENGING FOR ME AND THE

01:47:02.215 --> 01:47:05.218
WORLD VIEW. THAT DO YOU BELIEVE

01:47:05.285 --> 01:47:08.054
IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKE SOME

01:47:08.121 --> 01:47:10.390
TIME TO FIGURE OUT. IF WE CAN

01:47:10.457 --> 01:47:12.859
DETERMINE WELL MANAGED PROGRAMS

01:47:12.926 --> 01:47:14.895
THAT WE LOOK AT COUNTRY

01:47:14.961 --> 01:47:18.565
SPECIFIC FILTERS BY WHICH WE

01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:20.500
RECOGNIZE WHICH COUNTRIES IN

01:47:20.567 --> 01:47:23.170
THE WORLD ARE NOT CONSERVING

01:47:23.236 --> 01:47:25.806
ANIMAL POPULATIONS PROPERLY

01:47:25.872 --> 01:47:28.408
THAT ARE NOT USING THE FUNDS

01:47:28.475 --> 01:47:30.443
COLLECTED TO DO IT PROPERLY AND

01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:33.079
AGAIN I BELIEVE IT'S MORALLY

01:47:33.146 --> 01:47:35.148
REPUGNANT IT IS IMMORAL. TO DO

01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:38.285
I TO DO TROPHY HUNTING IT'S NOT

01:47:38.351 --> 01:47:39.786
SOMETHING THAT I UNDERSTAND BUT

01:47:39.853 --> 01:47:42.622
WE HAVE WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON

01:47:42.689 --> 01:47:45.192
THE VERY SAME GOAL TO ONE LIMIT

01:47:45.258 --> 01:47:47.794
HARM TO ANIMALS AND ALSO WELL

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:49.296
THE TWO GOALS LIMIT HARM TO

01:47:49.362 --> 01:47:50.831
ANIMALS THE PAIN AND SUFFERING

01:47:50.897 --> 01:47:56.903
THAT THEY UNDERGO. AND ALL. TO

01:47:56.970 --> 01:47:58.705
BACK THE POPULATION. ONE

01:47:58.772 --> 01:48:00.273
AMAZING SPEED OF WHY THAT

01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:02.375
SHOULD BE HERE FOREVER- THAT

01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:07.147
HUMAN ACTION IS ACTIVELY- HURT

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:09.349
YOU KNOW ENDING THE SPECIES

01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:12.619
TIME ON THIS PLANET AND- AND SO

01:48:12.686 --> 01:48:15.655
AGAIN VERY COUNTER INTUITIVE

01:48:15.722 --> 01:48:19.593
FOR ME TO READ A HOW BY US IN

01:48:19.659 --> 01:48:22.796
THE WAY THAT WE VIEW THE WORLD.

01:48:22.863 --> 01:48:24.998
AT THE WAY TO SET POLICY COULD

01:48:25.065 --> 01:48:27.434
END UP ACTUALLY HARMING SOME OF

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:31.571
OUR GOALS AND SO I IN. TO FOR

01:48:31.638 --> 01:48:34.140

01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:39.012
TEAM TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S A

01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:41.014
WAY TO EFFECTIVELY PROTECTS BE

01:48:41.081 --> 01:48:43.116
USED AT THE FACT IN GROSS

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:46.319
SPECIES AND IN A WAY TO DO THIS

01:48:46.386 --> 01:48:47.287
IN A WAY A IN AN S. A POLICY

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:49.656

EXTRAORDINARILY- EXTRAORDINARY

STRONG MORAL CONCERNS ABOUT IT

01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:59.266
IT IS ANATHEMA TO WAY THAT WE

01:48:59.332 --> 01:49:00.934
FEEL IN THE WAY THAT WE SEE

01:49:01.001 --> 01:49:02.969
THIS ISSUE- AND SO THIS PART.

01:49:03.036 --> 01:49:04.437
BOB IS THE NOMINATION CHALLENGE

01:49:04.504 --> 01:49:06.773
OUR WRLD VIEWS. BUT I IT WOULD

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.808
BE GOOD TO SEE WHAT THE

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:11.278
OUTCOMES. OF LAWS LIKE THIS

01:49:11.344 --> 01:49:13.647
WOULD BE RATHER THAN THE STATED

01:49:13.713 --> 01:49:17.384
GOALS- NOT MEETING. THE

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:18.818

FITS UNDER- THE LANDS OF. KOBE

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:40.340

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:21.207
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THIS

01:51:21.274 --> 01:51:23.209

PERIOD HOWEVER THE HUNT GOES AS

01:51:55.175 --> 01:51:58.812
WE'VE SEEN IN STARK RELIEF BUT

01:52:11.391 --> 01:52:12.859
BILL. BUT WE ALL. THEY'RE ALL

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:15.595
OVER IS A MY MORE POTENT TWAY.

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:17.397

ELEPHANT SAY AS COMMERCE. THAT

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.002
ELEPHANT OVER A LIFETIME THE

01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:23.736
STATE ALIVE IS GOING TO

01:52:23.803 --> 01:52:27.307

WHATEVER THAT HUNTING PARTY IS

01:52:40.019 --> 01:52:41.554
AND THAT'S IT SO THAT'S WHY

01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:43.623
STEP A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:47.494
SHOWN MUCH MORE JOB IN A LOCAL.

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.295

INTER HOUSE FRUSTRATIONS THE

02:00:25.651 --> 02:00:27.453
REALITY IS THAT OUR SPEAKERS

GIVEN US THE DISCRETION. TO

02:00:29.021 --> 02:00:30.890

HEARD NINE BILLS AS LABOR CHAIR

02:00:36.295 --> 02:00:37.763
NOT ALL RECALLS RELATED AND I

02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:39.398
HAD THE RIGHT AND ABILITY TO DO

02:00:39.465 --> 02:00:40.600
THAT AS CHAIR AND I FULLY

FOR HAVING THIS BILL HEARD- AND

02:00:45.438 --> 02:00:46.906
IT DOES FOR IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY

02:00:46.973 --> 02:00:48.874
FALLS WITHIN THE DISCRETION

02:00:48.941 --> 02:00:51.277
THAT OF AND GUIDANCE I SHOULD

02:00:51.344 --> 02:00:53.579
SAY- FROM OUR SPEAKER AND

02:00:53.646 --> 02:00:56.148
LEADERSHIP AND SO- YOU KNOW I'M

02:00:56.215 --> 02:00:58.784
HAPPY THAT THIS BILL IS BEFORE

02:00:58.851 --> 02:00:59.452
US TODAY. I ALSO DO BELIEVE

02:00:59.518 --> 02:01:01.721
THAT IT IS RELEVANT- AS TO SOME

02:01:01.787 --> 02:01:03.856
OF THE COMMENTS FROM OF EXPERT

02:01:03.923 --> 02:01:05.191
TESTIMONY AS WELL AS SENATOR

02:01:05.257 --> 02:01:08.394
STERN- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

02:01:08.461 --> 02:01:11.197
IMPORTATION. OF ANIMALS TALK

02:01:11.263 --> 02:01:22.441
ABOUT MARKET. HAS SOMEHOW BEEN

02:01:22.508 --> 02:01:24.944
RELATED- WITH- THE

02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:27.146
INTERMINGLING OF HUMANS AND

02:01:27.213 --> 02:01:27.980
WILDLIFE FOR ANIMALS OF SOME

02:01:28.047 --> 02:01:31.050
SORT- AND AS WAS JUST INDICATED

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:35.988
THAT'S LIKELY THE CASE HERE SO.

02:01:36.055 --> 02:01:37.490
REGARDLESS WHETHER IS DIRECTLY

02:01:37.556 --> 02:01:39.759
RELATED TO THE TRANSMISSION OF

02:01:39.825 --> 02:01:41.394
COVERT SPECIFICALLY THE REALITY

02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:44.363
IS THAT WE DO NOW- THAT THERE

02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:46.766
IS ALWAYS A RISK- WILL WIN AS

02:01:46.832 --> 02:01:49.268
PER PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU HAVE-

02:01:49.335 --> 02:01:51.737
ANIMALS SO THAT ARE NOT WITHIN

02:01:51.804 --> 02:01:53.773
THE MAINSTREAM. OF IMPORTATION

02:01:53.839 --> 02:01:55.341
FOR SOME RAP UP THE TROPHY

02:01:55.408 --> 02:01:57.977
ANIMALS OR IN SOME CASES SOME

02:01:58.044 --> 02:02:00.413
OF THESE- ANIMAL IMPORTATION

02:02:00.479 --> 02:02:03.983
THAT IS MORE UNIQUE- CERTAINLY.

02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:07.420
UP AND TO THE ISSUE AT HAND-

02:02:07.486 --> 02:02:10.056
PARTICULARLY SINCE WE HEARD.

02:02:10.122 --> 02:02:11.757
MOSTLY OF A GARDEN THAT THE

02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:14.293
CHAU. ANIMAL ASPECT OF IT HOW

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:17.663
DOES A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS-

02:02:17.730 --> 02:02:20.232
LOOK AT BOTH OF THE SCIENCE-

02:02:20.299 --> 02:02:22.234
AND THE DATA AND I THINK YOU

02:02:22.301 --> 02:02:23.636
LOOK THE SCIENCE THE DATA ON

02:02:23.703 --> 02:02:24.670
THE ACTUAL REPORTS. AN

02:02:24.737 --> 02:02:26.439
INTERNATIONAL POURS SHOW THEY

02:02:26.505 --> 02:02:28.174
WILL SHOW THAT THE IMPACT OF

02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:31.911
ECO TOUR TOURISM ECONOMICALLY-

02:02:31.977 --> 02:02:35.748
IS FAR OUTPACING OF THAT ACT

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:39.485
I'M A CAPTIVITY. UP FROM FEE

02:02:39.552 --> 02:02:41.687
HUNTING. AND SO. THE REALITY IS

02:02:41.754 --> 02:02:42.888
THAT ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME

02:02:42.955 --> 02:02:44.056
INTERESTS THAT ARE GOING TO

02:02:44.123 --> 02:02:47.793
WANT TO MAINTAIN- SOME FLOW OF

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:49.895
THE ECONOMY- INTO THEIR COFFERS

02:02:49.962 --> 02:02:52.898
AND AS INDICATED BY THE AUTHOR-

02:02:52.965 --> 02:02:54.033
THEM THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:56.736
RESOURCES. OF IS ALSO. A

02:02:56.802 --> 02:03:00.172
QUESTION. HOWEVER ULTIMATELY.

02:03:00.239 --> 02:03:02.608
THIS ISN'T. ABOUT A JUDGMENT ON

02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:04.677
THE MORALITY OF ACTIONS. OF

02:03:04.744 --> 02:03:06.278
OTHERS OR OF NATIONS AND

02:03:06.345 --> 02:03:07.079
APHRODITE IT THIS HAS TO DO

02:03:07.146 --> 02:03:10.549
WITH US- THE THIS IS A JUDGMENT

02:03:10.616 --> 02:03:12.284
OF OUR OWN REALITY WE'RE NOT

02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:14.420
TALKING ABOUT THE- BUT THEY CAN

02:03:14.487 --> 02:03:18.591
DO- WE'RE MAKING A STATEMENT ON

02:03:18.657 --> 02:03:20.059
WHAT WE'RE WILLING. TO INDOOR.

02:03:20.126 --> 02:03:22.228
AND SO IF WE GET IT NOT JUST

02:03:22.294 --> 02:03:23.896
MORALLY BUT SCIENTIFICALLY AND

02:03:23.963 --> 02:03:26.165
ECONOMICALLY- CALIFORNIA DOES

02:03:26.232 --> 02:03:27.933
PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE- AND THE

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.969
REALITY IS WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.

02:03:30.035 --> 02:03:30.803
IF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:32.538
DIDN'T ROLL BACK ONCE AGAIN A

02:03:32.605 --> 02:03:36.609
NOTHER OBAMA- ERA- REGULATION.

02:03:36.675 --> 02:03:37.610
AND THERE HAVE BEEN DOZENS

02:03:37.676 --> 02:03:39.078
RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT THIS

02:03:39.145 --> 02:03:40.613
ADMINISTRATION IS ALL ABOUT

02:03:40.679 --> 02:03:42.548
INCLUDING A BILL BUT I HAD. A

02:03:42.615 --> 02:03:44.316
PASSED AND SIGNED BY SIGNED

02:03:44.383 --> 02:03:45.151
INTO LAW THE MIGRATORY BIRD

02:03:45.217 --> 02:03:46.886
PROTECTION ACT WHICH WAS

02:03:46.952 --> 02:03:48.954
ACTIVATED TO AND OBAMA ERA. ARE

02:03:49.021 --> 02:03:51.323
ACTUALLY ONE HUNDRED YEAR-

02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:53.759
TREATY THE PUNCH WAS IN AND- A

02:03:53.826 --> 02:03:55.961
PART OF THIS ADMINISTRATION

02:03:56.028 --> 02:03:59.632
ROLLED BACK. IN SO. WE HAVE.

02:03:59.698 --> 02:04:01.367
ALL OF WE DON'T WE HAVE A LOT

02:04:01.433 --> 02:04:04.136
OF INFLUENCE. AS A STATE OF IF

02:04:04.203 --> 02:04:05.538
WE LOOK AT WHAT WE JUST DID

02:04:05.604 --> 02:04:07.072
RECENTLY IN LAST COUPLE YEARS.

02:04:07.139 --> 02:04:09.041
ON BANNING THE SALE OF

02:04:09.108 --> 02:04:11.143
COSMETICS THAT HAVE ANY ANIMAL

02:04:11.210 --> 02:04:12.845
TESTING WE WERE TOLD. THAT IT

02:04:12.912 --> 02:04:14.547
WAS GONNA BE TOLL THE-

02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:16.015
DESTROYER MARKET BECAUSE

02:04:16.081 --> 02:04:16.849
CHINA'S OFTEN ALLOW US TO

02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:18.617
IMPORT. BECAUSE MEDICS WHAT

02:04:18.684 --> 02:04:20.119
HAPPENED AFTER THAT. CHINA'S

02:04:20.186 --> 02:04:21.687
HARD RELAX THOSE RULES BECAUSE

02:04:21.754 --> 02:04:23.155
OF THE INFLUENCE OF OUR MARKET.

02:04:23.222 --> 02:04:24.523
DOES THE INFLUENCE OF THE

02:04:24.590 --> 02:04:26.792
DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE- IN

02:04:26.859 --> 02:04:28.828
ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND

02:04:28.894 --> 02:04:29.528
LEADERSHIP AND ANIMAL

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:30.930
PROTECTION. WE HAVE THE

02:04:30.996 --> 02:04:34.200
OPPORTUNITY. TO ONCE AGAIN MAKE

02:04:34.266 --> 02:04:35.868
A CLEAR STATEMENT. AS TO WHERE

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:37.837
OUR VALUES ARE- TO NOT

02:04:37.903 --> 02:04:40.439
CONTRIBUTE. TO A PRACTICE- THAT

02:04:40.506 --> 02:04:42.474
IS FAR MORE DETRIMENTAL TO THE

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:44.109
ENVIRONMENT EVEN IN TERMS OF

02:04:44.176 --> 02:04:45.544
CONSERVATION CERTAIN. THE ECO

02:04:45.611 --> 02:04:49.381
TOURISM- BUT IN TERMS OF. IF

02:04:49.448 --> 02:04:51.684
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THESE ANIMALS

02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:53.252
ARE EXTINCT IS BECAUSE OF THE

02:04:53.319 --> 02:04:54.320
PRACTICE. BUT YEAH CAN BE A

02:04:54.386 --> 02:04:55.554
PRACTICE. IS THAT MAY BETTER

02:04:55.621 --> 02:05:00.593
THAN WHAT IS AB THE PAST PLUS

02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:01.227
BUT. IT DOESN'T MAKE IT MORE

02:05:01.293 --> 02:05:03.028
VIABLE BUT- ECONOMICALLY IT

02:05:03.095 --> 02:05:04.864
DOESN'T MAKE MORE PROTECTIVE

02:05:04.930 --> 02:05:06.465
SCIENTIFICALLY AND IT DOESN'T

02:05:06.532 --> 02:05:09.268
MAKE IT- MORE OF MORAL-

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:11.804
INAPPROPRIATE- THEN FOCUSING ON

02:05:11.871 --> 02:05:13.839
OTHER WAYS. TO CONSERVE AND

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:15.674
AGAIN- JUST UNDER CERTAIN POINT

02:05:15.741 --> 02:05:16.942
WE'RE NOT TELLING ANYONE ELSE

02:05:17.009 --> 02:05:19.979
WHAT TO DO. WE'RE JUST MAKING-

02:05:20.045 --> 02:05:20.813
WE'RE MAKING A GESTURE BASED

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:22.915
UPON OUR OWN MORALITY THAT

02:05:22.982 --> 02:05:25.918
DISTANCE WITH- WHERE OUR NATION

02:05:25.985 --> 02:05:28.854

MERRILY IN A WAY TO AVOID ANY

POTENTIAL PREEMPTION CHALLENGES

02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:22.848
OF COURSE WE'VE GOT A SEPARATE

02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:35.427
SUCCESSFUL BUT IN. THEY REALLY

02:10:35.494 --> 02:10:37.062
STARTED INTRUDE ON INTERSTATE

02:10:37.129 --> 02:10:38.330
COMMERCE AND LOOKING

02:10:38.397 --> 02:10:40.065
SPECIFICALLY AT DEALING WITH

BUT- THIS BILL REALLY. ISN'T

02:10:48.307 --> 02:10:50.943
DESIGNED IN THAT SAME WAY.
