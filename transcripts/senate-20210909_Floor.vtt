HARASSMENT AND YOU'RE NOW

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:14.793
TAKING AWAY OF A WAY FOR THEM

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.495
TO HAVE A MECHANISM AGAINST A

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:19.598
BAD EMPLOYER- FLOOR. NUMBER

00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:22.501
TWO. A PARTY IS A REAL PROBLEM

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:23.702
AND MAYBE ALL THESE CLAIMS ARE

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.804
FALSE I HAVE NO IDEA DOESN'T

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:27.072
SOUND LIKE IT WHEN YOU READ THE

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:27.973
DOCUMENTS IN THE WITNESS

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.375

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:33.312
BRING THOSE IN HERE. OR NUMBER

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:35.547
THREE. WE JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:37.216
THESE EMPLOYEES THAT NEED THIS

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:39.885
MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO- FILE A

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.286
CLAIM AGAINST THEIR EMPLOYER

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:42.221
AND HAVE SOME TYPE OF THE

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:43.956
GREEDY SYSTEM OUTSIDE A UNION

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:45.023
CONTRACT THAT BINDS THEM TO

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.993
ARBITRATION. WITH NO REMEDY AND

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.562
SO OUT OF RESPECT FOR JANITORS

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:52.898
ACROSS THE STATE I ASKED FOR A

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:59.438
NO VOTE. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:04.009
YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. I

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.545
ALSO RISE IN OPPOSITION BAND I

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:09.014
WANT TO SHARE THAT. IN TWO

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:14.686
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAD. A. B.

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:15.287
SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH WAS A

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:17.289
RUBIO BILL THEY DID THE EXACT

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:19.324
SAME THING THAT THIS BILLS ARE

00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:19.925
PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT THIS BILL

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:22.828
IS DOING. AND I WAS ONE OF THE

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:25.264
ONLY REPUBLICANS THAT VOTED FOR.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.533
BECAUSE I THINK THAT PARKER HAS

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:32.037
A HUGE AMOUNT OF. W. CIS. MANY

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:33.505
COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING TO DO

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:35.974
THE RIGHT THING GET. FINED AND

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:38.210
SUED BECAUSE OF PARKING

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:40.979
VIOLATIONS. AND NOW WE'RE DOING

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.447
ONE OFFS THIS IS THIS IS

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:45.450
EXACTLY WHAT THE SENATOR FROM

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:45.951
BAKERSFIELD SAID THIS IS

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:48.787
EXEMPTING. UNIONIZED COMPANIES

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:51.423
WHO ARE BAD ACTORS IF YOU VOTE

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.792
FOR THIS BILL YOU'RE EXEMPTING.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:56.528
COMPANIES THAT ARE BAD ACTORS.

00:19:56.595 --> 00:20:01.533
YOU KNOW. WE HEAR ABOUT WE

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.303
HEARD YESTERDAY FROM. FROM THE

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:06.538
SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA THAT

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:07.372
WE DON'T LIKE TO BE WE DON'T

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:08.740
LIKE TO BE PARTISAN WE DON'T

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:11.176
TALK ABOUT HOW. SUPPOSEDLY

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:15.380
REPUBLICANS HELP BUSINESS OUT.

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:17.549
THIS BILL RIGHT HERE IS EXACTLY

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:18.684
WHAT THE SENATOR WAS TALKING

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.719
ABOUT IF YOU VOTE FOR THIS BILL

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:22.854
YOU'RE HELPING EXEMPT A COMPANY

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:25.757
THAT HAS BEEN BAD. HOW'S THAT

00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:28.427
GOING TO HELP THE WORKER. SO I

00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:30.128
STAND WITH THE CENTER FROM

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:32.331
BAKERSFIELD I ACTUALLY VOTED

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:33.665
FOR THESE EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE I

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.735
THINK WE NEED TO FIX PAGA. NOT

00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:40.572
ALLOW IT TO BE A TOOL. TO BE

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:42.641
MANIPULATED BY THIS LEGISLATOR

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:44.576
SO THAT COMPANIES GOOD OR BAD

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:46.311
CAN GET INTO A WAIVER THAT'S

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:48.880
WRONG. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO THE

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:51.550
RIGHT THING THE RIGHT THING IS

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:53.685

00:21:06.164 --> 00:21:08.266
GOING TO PENALIZE YOU. THAT'S

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:11.870
WRONG BUT NO DO THE RIGHT THING.

CENTERED ON. YEAH I'VE GOT A

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:18.677
PRESIDENT I TAKE A DIFFERENT

VIEW OF THIS I DON'T DISAGREE

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:23.081
THAT THERE ARE ABUSES WITH PAPA

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.650
I TRY TO POP THE REFORM BILL

00:21:24.716 --> 00:21:26.151
THIS YEAR I COULD NOT GET TO

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:28.353
FIRST BASE. AND I WASN'T

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.589
TALKING ABOUT ANY BIG THING I

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.057
WAS TALKING ABOUT A PAYSTUB

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:35.260
VIOLATIONS. SO LOOK IT. IN THIS

00:21:35.327 --> 00:21:37.863
HOUSE IN THE OTHER HOUSE WE'RE

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:40.332

00:22:01.253 --> 00:22:03.288
DOING SOME MORE INCREMENTAL

00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:05.424
WHAT OFF THINGS THAT HELP OUR

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.758
EMPLOYERS WHO ARE GETTING

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.593
BEATEN UP EVERY SINGLE DAY BYE

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.863
PADA ADD SOME CASES. THEY'RE

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.532
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN THOSE

00:22:13.598 --> 00:22:15.233
EMPLOYERS NED TO BE BEATEN UP

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.868
BUT IN MANY CASES PARTICULARLY

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:17.869
IN MY DISTRICT WHERE PEOPLE

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:19.805
COME TO ME IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY

00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:21.907

INCLUDE. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND-

00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:34.853
I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST NATURE

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.624
OF THIS DEBATE AND I'M REMINDED-

00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:41.793
BY MY DAD USED TO ALWAYS COLD

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.262
FLATTEN. IT BASICALLY SAYING

00:22:44.329 --> 00:22:45.530
WHEN THE REASON FOR THE RULE

00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:49.735
SEIZES THE ROLE CEASES. IN

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:50.302
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE SENATOR

00:22:50.368 --> 00:22:54.506
DONE PAST. BOB HARGA. IN THE

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:57.476
UNDERLYING FRAMEWORK BRIEFLY OF

00:22:57.542 --> 00:23:00.378
EMPLOYMENT LAW IS WHEN SOMEONE

00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:03.682
DOESN'T HAVE THE PROTECTION H.

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:06.918
TWO OF A LARGER GROUP THERE'S A

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:08.954
DESPERATE BARGAINING POWER AND

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.655
SO WHETHER THOSE CLAIMS WERE

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:12.491
MADE BY ONE COMPANY OR ANOTHER

00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:14.826
COMPANY CERTAINLY DOES EXIST

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:17.963
BUT THE SOLUTION HERE IS TO

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.831
BALANCE OUT THE DISPARATE

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:21.733
BARGAINING POWER SO THAT THERE

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.535
CAN BE A CONTRACT WITH RESPECT

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:24.703
TO THOSE POINTS THAT WERE

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:25.604
RAISED BY THE CENTER OF

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.639
BAKERSFIELD THAT WILL IN FACT

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.708
PROTECT THE WORKERS AND THAT IN

00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:31.276
FACT SINCE YOU DON'T HAVE THE

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:32.677
COLLECTIVE TO SUPPORT THIS

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:34.646
IMBALANCE OF POWER. THAT'S WHY

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:36.915
YOU NEED PAGA AND WHEN YOU HAVE

00:23:36.982 --> 00:23:38.416
THE COLLECTIVE PARTICULARLY

00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:40.619
INDUSTRY THE BERKELEY TALKS

00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:42.254
ABOUT HIS REPORT THE RACE TO

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.889
THE BOTTOM YOU HAVE A

00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:45.991
PARTICULAR UNIQUE GROUP OF

00:23:46.057 --> 00:23:48.527
INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED THAT

00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:51.463
LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND SO THIS

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.931
IS A- BARGAIN IF YOU WILL THIS

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:55.400
IS SOMETHING. THAT IS AS- THE

00:23:55.467 --> 00:23:57.335
CENTER FROM NAPA INDICATED OKAY

00:23:57.402 --> 00:23:59.671
INCREMENTALISM BUT IT'S A BIG

00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:01.506
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:02.674
IT IS INFORMED BY THE

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:04.176

DISPUTE OUR BETWEEN THE

00:24:05.877 --> 00:24:07.879
INDIVIDUAL AND THE GROUP. AND

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:09.848
SO I THINK IT IS THOUGHTFUL I

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:11.216
THINK THAT IS CERTAINLY THERE

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.551
WILL BE A BUNCH OF COMPANIES

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:13.552
THAT WILL MAKE THE

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:54.546
ABOUT A PROVISION IN THE HARBOR

00:26:54.612 --> 00:26:59.017
THAT SAYS THAT THE- THE

00:26:59.084 --> 00:27:01.920
REDACTED TAX RETURNS ARE LEFT

00:27:01.987 --> 00:27:04.089
TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO

00:27:04.155 --> 00:27:04.556
DETERMINE IF THEY NEED

00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:07.192
SATISFACTION AND I AM NOT AWARE

00:27:07.258 --> 00:27:08.860
THAT THERE'S ANY STANDARD THAT

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:10.295
HAS BEEN PRODUCED SINCE THERE

00:27:10.362 --> 00:27:12.530
WAS A DEBATE OVER THE US

00:27:12.597 --> 00:27:14.532
EARLIER THIS YEAR IN ANOTHER

00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:16.668
ELECTION. IF THERE IN FACT A

00:27:16.735 --> 00:27:18.269
STANDARD THAT IS GIVEN TO THE

00:27:18.336 --> 00:27:20.338
SECRETARY OF STATE- CREATED

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:23.942
ALTHOUGH THAT IS NOT ARBITRARY

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:25.510
ON EACH AND EVERY I'LL RETURN.

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:26.644
THERE IS NOT A STANDARD THAT'S

00:27:26.711 --> 00:27:28.780
BEEN CODIFIED IN THE LAW- THE

00:27:28.847 --> 00:27:29.581
LAW WOULD APPLY A

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:31.383
REASONABLENESS STANDARD SO FOR

00:27:31.449 --> 00:27:32.984
EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE REJECTS

00:27:33.051 --> 00:27:34.386
THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER

00:27:34.452 --> 00:27:35.186
THAT WOULD BE PERFECTLY

00:27:35.253 --> 00:27:37.322
APPROPRIATE. THE SUMMER THE DAX

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:39.124
THERE YOU KNOW INCOME THAT

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.792
WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE AND SO

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.127
IT IS LEFT TO THE SECTOR'S

00:27:42.193 --> 00:27:43.628
STATE AND SHOULD THE SECTORS

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:44.796
STATE BE ARBITRARY AND

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:48.299
CAPRICIOUS. THEN OF COURSE THEN

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:48.933
ONE HAS RECOURSE TO THE COURTS.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.803
ON MY OWN TIME THEN- MEMBERS

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.805
WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY SPIRITED

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:55.206
DEBATES IN HERE ABOUT ELECTION

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:57.442
INTEGRITY. AND WHEN WE LEAVE

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:59.444
THINGS TO SOMEONE INDIVIDUALS

00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:02.180
DISCRETION- AND IT IS A

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:04.682
PARTISAN. POSITION WHICH I

00:28:04.749 --> 00:28:06.651
BELIEVE SHOULD BE CHANGED THAT

00:28:06.718 --> 00:28:09.120
RAISES THE IRE OF THOSE WHO DO

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.655
NOT AGREE OR BELIEVE THAT IT

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.690
WAS SO ARBITRARY AND IT HAD A

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:15.293
POLITICAL AGENDA OR MOTIVATION.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.262
SO I WOULD RECOMMEND ON. OUR

00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:19.230
BILLS LIKE THIS THAT WE TAKE A

00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:21.199
REALLY CLOSE LOOK. AT THE

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:25.036
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MAKING THE

00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:26.738
LAWS THAT WE ARE. MAKE SURE

00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:27.505
THAT THERE IS NOT AN

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:29.107
OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT PARTICULAR

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:30.408
INDIVIDUAL WHO WILL NOT HAVE

00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:32.877
THAT OFFICER EVER. HAVE SOME

00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:34.546
STANDARDS BY WHICH THEY OPERATE

00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:35.780
IN IS NOT LEFT TO THEIR

00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:37.615
DISCRETION BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED

00:28:37.682 --> 00:28:39.551
ABOUT IMPLICIT BIAS THOSE ARE

00:28:39.617 --> 00:28:41.219
THE THINGS THAT UNFORTUNATELY

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:43.221
HAVE INVADED OUR ELECTION

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:45.023
SYSTEM AND THE INTEGRITY. AND

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.658

GET RID OF THE RVCA READING

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:42.689

WE'RE WORKING ON THE

01:42:51.098 --> 01:42:52.199
REPLACEMENT SO IT'S NOT GOING

01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:54.234
TO GO AWAY THERE'S ALWAYS GOING

01:42:54.301 --> 01:42:56.103
TO BE A TEST UNTIL- THE

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:57.838
COMMISSION IS ABLE TO CREATE

01:42:57.905 --> 01:42:59.706
ONE THAT'S MORE UP TO DATE THE

01:42:59.773 --> 01:43:01.441
REASON THIS CAME ABOUT IS THAT

01:43:01.508 --> 01:43:03.343
WE'VE TRANSITIONED FROM. WHAT

01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:04.578
WE USED TO BE THE CALIFORNIA

01:43:04.645 --> 01:43:06.446
STATE STANDARDS TO NOW A COMMON

01:43:06.513 --> 01:43:07.781
CORE WHICH IS COMPLETELY

01:43:07.848 --> 01:43:09.550
DIFFERENT- HOW WE DO THINGS IN

01:43:09.616 --> 01:43:10.684
THE CLASSROOM SOLD A NEW

01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:12.853
UPDATED VERSION WILL SATISFY

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.888
THE CHANGES IN THE CURRICULUM

01:43:14.955 --> 01:43:18.125
AN ADVIL PM. AND PLEASE SO

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:20.093
AGAIN THE TEST DOES NOT GO AWAY

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.662
UNTIL THE NEW ONE IS CREATED SO

01:43:21.728 --> 01:43:23.163
THERE WILL BE NO CAP AND WHAT

01:43:23.230 --> 01:43:26.767
TEACHERS HAVE TO LEARN IMPROVE

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.869
THEIR COMPETENCY WITH. WELL I

01:43:28.936 --> 01:43:30.637
I'M NOT GOING TO OBJECT TO THE-

01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:33.440
SEPARATELY BUT I'M- GONNA LAY

01:43:33.507 --> 01:43:36.376
OFF OF THIS VOTE. MY CONCERN IS

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:38.512
WE HAVE THE WORST MATH AND

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:40.547
READING SCORES IN AMERICA. IN

01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:42.916
CALIFORNIA.AND ANYTHING WE DO

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:44.818
THAT WOULD DIMINISH. OUR

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:46.787
TEACHERS FROM BEING ABLE TO BE

01:43:46.853 --> 01:43:48.889
THE HIGHEST. COMPETENCY THAT

01:43:48.956 --> 01:43:50.691
COULD BE THAT I DON'T LIKE THAT

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:51.725
NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS

01:43:51.792 --> 01:43:54.328
BILL ACHIEVES THAT BUT LET'S

01:43:54.394 --> 01:44:02.269
JUST SAY I'M WORRIED. IT UP

01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:05.138
EITHER IT IS THERE ANY OTHER

01:44:05.205 --> 01:44:05.706
BAD DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:08.275
THIS ITEM. CNN SENATOR RUBIO

01:44:08.342 --> 01:44:10.944
YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU AND

01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:12.512

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:14.548
AGREE WITH WHAT YOU JUST STATED

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:15.682
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:17.317
TRANSITION AWAY THAT TEACHERS

01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:18.885
ACTUALLY HAVE REAL LIFE

01:44:18.952 --> 01:44:20.787
EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM ARE

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:22.389
ABLE TO REALLY BE IN A

01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:23.690
CLASSROOM SETTING WITH REAL

01:44:23.757 --> 01:44:25.325
LIFE STUDENTS AND ALSO HAVE

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:27.461
MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. I WAS

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:29.529
THERE ONCE AND I KNOW THAT JUST

01:44:29.596 --> 01:44:30.631
MEMORIZING THE TESTS ARE

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:31.732
LEARNING A TEST FROM THE BOOKS

01:44:31.798 --> 01:44:33.500
DOESN'T ALWAYS HELP AND I

01:44:33.567 --> 01:44:35.369
ALWAYS TELL THIS STORY I HAD A

01:44:35.435 --> 01:44:37.571

SIX MONTHS AFTER SPENDING FOUR

01:44:39.039 --> 01:44:40.807
YEARS AT GETTING HER DEGREE AND

01:44:40.874 --> 01:44:43.043
GOING THROUGH ALL HER EDUCATION

01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:44.411
TO GET HER CREDENTIALS IT TOOK

01:44:44.478 --> 01:44:45.846
SIX MONTHS FOR HER TO REALIZE

01:44:45.912 --> 01:44:48.081
IT WASN'T FOR HER. AND THE WAY

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:49.683
WE'RE TRANSITIONING THE TEST IS

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:51.051
TO ALLOW TEACHERS TO ACTUALLY

01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:52.986
STEP FOOT IN A CLASSROOM WORK

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:54.421
WITH STUDENTS HALF MENTOR

01:44:54.488 --> 01:44:56.490
TEACHERS HELP ON AND THEN

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:58.358
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FOR

01:44:58.425 --> 01:44:59.793
THEM BECAUSE WE WANT COMPETENT

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.194

ON RECORD FROM TWO THOUSAND

01:46:50.737 --> 01:46:51.271

YEAR PERIOD IN THE LAST FOUR

01:46:54.674 --> 01:46:56.443
HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS I DON'T

SPEND A LOT OF TIME BUT THIS IS

01:46:58.111 --> 01:46:59.880
A BIG DEAL IT'S REALLY

01:46:59.946 --> 01:47:03.617
IMPORTANT. AND SO MORE THAN 75%

01:47:03.683 --> 01:47:05.018
OF THE DROUGHT IMPACTED PUBLIC

01:47:05.085 --> 01:47:06.887
WATER SYSTEMS WERE SMALL

01:47:06.953 --> 01:47:08.855
SERVING A THOUSAND CONNECTIONS

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:10.690
OR FEWER I COME FROM LOS

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:12.492
ANGELES WHERE I HAVE A THOUSAND

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:13.693
CONNECTIONS AND A FEW BLOCKS OF

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:16.096
MY OF MY HOME. THIS IS

01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:17.264
SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US

01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:18.365
WHETHER WE COME FROM AN URBAN

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:20.801
AREA OR RURAL AREA NEED TO DEAL

01:47:20.867 --> 01:47:21.668
WITH THAT DEALS WITH EQUITY AND

01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:23.737
JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA ON

01:47:23.804 --> 01:47:24.171
SOMETHING THAT'S SO

01:47:24.237 --> 01:47:25.672
FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT. FOR

01:47:25.739 --> 01:47:26.940
THIS MEASURE ENHANCES THIS

01:47:27.007 --> 01:47:28.041
DROUGHT PLANNING FOR THESE

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:30.277
AREAS AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT

01:47:30.343 --> 01:47:31.912
THE NUMEROUS CO AUTHORS AND I

01:47:31.978 --> 01:47:32.846
WHEN WE COME TO THE CENTRAL

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:36.550
VALLEY WE ARE MET WITH.

01:47:36.616 --> 01:47:39.386
ENTHUSIASM AND A SHOUT OF HERE

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:42.189
COMES THE FANTASTIC SCIENCE

01:47:42.255 --> 01:47:44.524
REVIVAL. BUT IS THERE ANY

01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:46.793
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THAT.

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:49.529
ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

01:47:49.596 --> 01:47:53.466
SAYING THAT MEMBERS ARE SENATOR

01:47:53.533 --> 01:47:56.403
NIELSEN MY APOLOGY. MOUNT

01:47:56.469 --> 01:47:58.104
PLEASANT LANE DOWN THE CENTER I

01:47:58.171 --> 01:47:59.773
AM A LITTLE BIT WARY OF THIS

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:03.844
BILL. AS ONE WHO REPRESENTS SO

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:06.847
MANY SMALL JURISDICTIONS THE

01:48:06.913 --> 01:48:12.252
INTERFACE THESE PROBLEMS. WE

01:48:12.319 --> 01:48:16.323
UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN.

01:48:16.389 --> 01:48:17.991
A FORM WITH THE DROUGHT. WE

01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:21.461
LONG HAVE. BUT WE SQUANDER

01:48:21.528 --> 01:48:22.863
OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE MORE

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:27.634
WATER. THROUGH A BOND IT'S

01:48:27.701 --> 01:48:29.369
ALREADY BEEN PASSED SEVEN YEARS

01:48:29.436 --> 01:48:32.339
AGO TO BUILD LARGE SURFACE

01:48:32.405 --> 01:48:35.775
STORAGE. BUT WE CAN'T GET THAT

01:48:35.842 --> 01:48:38.044
DONE WHY ALL WE HAVE THESE

01:48:38.111 --> 01:48:40.580
LITTLE REVIEWS AND PERMITTING

01:48:40.647 --> 01:48:44.050
SORT OF IMPEDED THAT. THESE

01:48:44.117 --> 01:48:46.052
LITTLE JURISDICTIONS. THEY'RE

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:49.022
IN TROUBLE. SOME OF US

01:48:49.089 --> 01:48:50.657
REPRESENT AREAS WHERE WE'RE

01:48:50.724 --> 01:48:54.294
HAVING TO HELP THEM FIND WATER

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:56.029
TO BE HAULED OUT SIMPLY THAT

01:48:56.096 --> 01:48:56.930
THEY CAN HAVE SOMETHINGTO

01:48:56.997 --> 01:48:59.032
DRINK IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT

01:48:59.099 --> 01:49:01.868
WASHING YOUR CLOTHES. YEAH WE

01:49:01.935 --> 01:49:05.372
DO HAVE A PROBLEM HERE. BUT I'M

01:49:05.438 --> 01:49:09.175
JUST A LITTLE BIT WARY. ABOUT

01:49:09.242 --> 01:49:12.145
HAVING MORE GOVERNMENT CONTROL

01:49:12.212 --> 01:49:14.347
NOW WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT. WE

01:49:14.414 --> 01:49:16.016
ALREADY HAVE THE SUSTAINABLE

01:49:16.082 --> 01:49:17.918
GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT

01:49:17.984 --> 01:49:21.121
LEGISLATION AND EACH COUNTY HAS

01:49:21.187 --> 01:49:22.022
TO HAVE ITS OWN SUSTAINABLE

01:49:22.088 --> 01:49:24.457
GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:28.461
AND ITS OWN PLANTS. AND SOME OF

01:49:28.528 --> 01:49:30.897
THE SMALL DISTRICTS. THOUSAND

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:34.401
OR LESS. THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:49:34.467 --> 01:49:36.736
REQUIRED TO COME UP WITH PLANS.

01:49:36.803 --> 01:49:39.606
WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THAT.

01:49:39.673 --> 01:49:40.941
WHO'S GOING TO BE

01:49:41.007 --> 01:49:43.043
TECHNOLOGICALLY CAPABLE. OF

01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:45.445
COMING UP FOR THOSE PLANS THESE

01:49:45.512 --> 01:49:46.379
THINGS HAVE TO BE THOUGHT

01:49:46.446 --> 01:49:48.114
THROUGH BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:50.650
REALLY EASY TO DO WHAT WE'RE

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:51.785
GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE

01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:54.187
SMALL. JURISDICTIONS IT NEEDS

01:49:54.254 --> 01:50:00.026
TO BE. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION

01:50:00.093 --> 01:50:02.729
OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM.

01:50:02.796 --> 01:50:05.598
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SAYING

01:50:05.665 --> 01:50:06.199
NONE SENATOR HERTZBERG YOU MAY

01:50:06.266 --> 01:50:09.703
CONCLUDE. I JUST WANTED TO

01:50:09.769 --> 01:50:11.705
ADDRESSABLE I BELIEVE THIS

01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:14.641
ISSUE OF COST. COLLECT STATE

01:50:14.708 --> 01:50:17.610
IMPLEMENTATION OF- AS PART OF

01:50:17.677 --> 01:50:20.380
THIS DEBT THE COST HAS BEEN

01:50:20.447 --> 01:50:22.182
DEALT WITH I CAN'T DEAL WITH

01:50:22.248 --> 01:50:23.316
THAT SPECIFICALLY WILL CIRCLE

01:50:23.383 --> 01:50:25.352
BACK WITH SENATOR. THE

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:27.654
IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT. BUT

QUANTIFIED FOR CALIFORNIA AND-

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:56.015
WHAT'S CALIFORNIA'S SEMEN

02:00:56.082 --> 02:00:58.250
PRODUCTION REGARDING THE GLOBAL

02:00:58.317 --> 02:01:02.221
PERCENTAGE- IN TERMS OF OUR IF

02:01:02.288 --> 02:01:02.722
YOU LOOK AT ALL OF OUR

02:01:02.788 --> 02:01:05.358
GREENHOUSE GASES THAT CEMENT IS

02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:08.127
DEAR 2% OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:01:08.194 --> 02:01:10.229
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. 32%

02:01:10.296 --> 02:01:13.032
ON THE ON THE- HI CALIFORNIA

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:14.800
MISSIONS AND THEN EXTRAPOLATE

02:01:14.867 --> 02:01:16.302
THAT GLOBALLY YOU KNOW THAT

02:01:16.369 --> 02:01:18.371
NUMBER OBVIOUSLY COMES DOWN

02:01:18.437 --> 02:01:20.973
QUITE A BIT SMALLER- MEMBERS

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:22.575
WITH THE POINT I'M TRYING TO

02:01:22.642 --> 02:01:24.977
MAKE HERE IS. CALIFORNIA HAS

02:01:25.044 --> 02:01:27.046
DONE A REAT JOB OF LOWERING

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:28.748
OUR EMISSIONS WE REALLY HAVE

02:01:28.814 --> 02:01:31.884
AND THEN I REALLY DO APPLAUD

02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:32.451
THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES

02:01:32.518 --> 02:01:34.587
BOARD. ADVANCEMENTS OVER THE

02:01:34.654 --> 02:01:36.122
LAST TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS

02:01:36.188 --> 02:01:38.424
I REMEMBER IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

02:01:38.491 --> 02:01:40.292
MOVING TO CALIFORNIA TO SAN

02:01:40.359 --> 02:01:40.926
DIEGO SPECIFICALLY FROM

02:01:40.993 --> 02:01:43.262
COLORADO AND- HAVING SEX NEVER

02:01:43.329 --> 02:01:44.630
HAVING HAD A SMOG DAY IN

02:01:44.697 --> 02:01:46.699
COLORADO I DON'T WHAT THAT WAS-

02:01:46.766 --> 02:01:48.067
BUT WE HAD A COUPLE OF THEM.

02:01:48.134 --> 02:01:50.302
WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY

02:01:50.369 --> 02:01:52.505
SCHOOL- YOU KNOW BACK IN THE

02:01:52.571 --> 02:01:55.641
EIGHTIES. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE

02:01:55.708 --> 02:01:57.743
GOT OUR AIR QUALITY INTO A

02:01:57.810 --> 02:02:00.212
PRETTY GOOD PLACE IN CALIFORNIA

02:02:00.279 --> 02:02:01.781
AND WHAT I'M AFRAID OF IS WE'RE

02:02:01.847 --> 02:02:04.050
WE'RE JUST NOW ENTERING INTO

02:02:04.116 --> 02:02:06.152
THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS.

02:02:06.218 --> 02:02:10.656
WHERE WE'RE JUST YOU KNOW KINDA.

02:02:10.723 --> 02:02:11.624
HACKING AT THE EDGES ON THIS

02:02:11.691 --> 02:02:14.527
THING 2% YOU KNOW IT IS SO WHAT

02:02:14.593 --> 02:02:16.662
THAT TELLS ME IS IF WE CUT ALL

02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:17.229
OF CALIFORNIA'S EMISSIONS ON

02:02:17.296 --> 02:02:20.700
CEMENT. THAT WOULD LOWER

02:02:20.766 --> 02:02:21.467
CALIFORNIA'S EMISSIONS BY TWO

02:02:21.534 --> 02:02:23.903
PERCENT. BUT WHAT IMPACT DOES

02:02:23.969 --> 02:02:25.705
THAT REALLY MAKE IT GLOBALLY.

02:02:25.771 --> 02:02:28.307
AND I THINK AT SOME POINT TIME

02:02:28.374 --> 02:02:29.241
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE POINT

02:02:29.308 --> 02:02:32.445
HERE WERE WERE PASSING COMMON

02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:34.046

EMISSIONS- AND AS OUR-

02:02:37.483 --> 02:02:38.184
COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD

02:02:38.250 --> 02:02:39.719
POINTED OUT YESTERDAY LAWN

02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:41.854
MOWERS AND EDGERS AND- AND

02:02:41.921 --> 02:02:44.356
SUCH- THAT'S GONNA MAKE. NO

02:02:44.423 --> 02:02:46.859
IMPACT GLOBALLY I BELIEVE THAT

02:02:46.926 --> 02:02:50.362

INTERNATIONALLY PUT IT IS IT IS

02:03:27.433 --> 02:03:29.935
A CHUNK AND WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS

02:03:30.002 --> 02:03:31.871

THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES WE ARE

02:03:56.996 --> 02:03:58.664
GOING TO HAVE AN ADDITION

02:03:58.731 --> 02:04:00.399
THAT'S COULD BE MADE TO OTHER

02:04:00.466 --> 02:04:01.433
AREAS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THAT

EVERYTHING IS CUMULATIVE. WE'RE

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:15.474
TALKING ABOUT 2% FOR. CONCRETE

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:16.909
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LAWN MOWERS

THEY'RE NOT ONE OFFS THEY'RE

02:05:20.779 --> 02:05:22.147
CUMULATIVE AND WHEN YOU PUT

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:24.083
THEM ALL TOGETHER. THAT CREATES

02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:26.085
A BIGGER PROBLEM. ONE STUDY

02:05:26.151 --> 02:05:27.887

ACTUALLY. CREATE MORE

02:05:33.225 --> 02:05:35.027
GREENHOUSE GASES THAN CARS ON

02:05:35.094 --> 02:05:36.562
THE ROAD. I DON'T HAVE THE

02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:37.930
STADIUM FROM ME I APOLOGIZE FOR

02:05:37.997 --> 02:05:39.531
THAT. AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY

02:05:39.598 --> 02:05:41.267
THE AIR QUALITY IN CALIFORNIA

02:05:41.333 --> 02:05:43.202
IN SOME PARTS OF CALIFORNIA IS

02:05:43.269 --> 02:05:44.937
BETTER. PLEASE COME TO THE

02:05:45.004 --> 02:05:46.672
INLAND EMPIRE WHERE WE HAVE THE

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:49.775
HIGHEST. RATES AND WHEN I WAS A

02:05:49.842 --> 02:05:51.343
YOUNG CHILD WITH SMOG DAYS WE

02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:52.678
COULDN'T SEE THE MOUNTAINS. WE

CAN SEE THE MOUNTAINS NOW. BUT

02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:56.315
GUESS WHAT THE PARTICULATES ARE

02:05:56.382 --> 02:05:57.983
SMALLER AND THE AIR QUALITY IS

02:05:58.050 --> 02:06:00.185
JUST AS BAD. SO WE HAVE A LOT

02:06:00.252 --> 02:06:01.987
OF WORK TO DO. BUT I'LL JUST

02:06:02.054 --> 02:06:04.123
REMIND PEOPLE. CUMULATIVE IT'S

02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:05.457

I THINK WE'RE REALLY MISSING

02:06:19.738 --> 02:06:22.775
THE POINT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

02:06:22.841 --> 02:06:25.611

02:06:40.759 --> 02:06:43.028
THE IMPACTS THAT WE MAKE ARE

02:06:43.095 --> 02:06:44.863
SMALL IN THIS AREA WITH WHEN

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:47.366
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 2% OF

02:06:47.433 --> 02:06:50.302
CALIFORNIA'S EMISSIONS. MAKING

02:06:50.369 --> 02:06:51.570
CONCRETE SOMETHING WE NEED

02:06:51.637 --> 02:06:53.472
EVERY DAY BUT WE ALSO NEED

02:06:53.539 --> 02:06:56.408
WATERSHEDS WE ALSO NEED. TREES

02:06:56.475 --> 02:06:59.078
THAT ACTUALLY SEQUESTER CARBON

02:06:59.144 --> 02:07:02.214
THAT AREN'T DEAD AND SO. I

02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:02.781
THINK THE POLICIES THAT COME

02:07:02.848 --> 02:07:05.784
OUT HERE THE PROBLEM. WE DON'T

02:07:05.851 --> 02:07:08.287
FOCUS ON THE AREA WHERE WE CAN

02:07:08.354 --> 02:07:11.423
REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WHICH

02:07:11.490 --> 02:07:14.760
IS BY REDUCING WILDFIRE. YOU

02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:15.361

02:07:15.427 --> 02:07:17.229
FOR THE LAST. TWO AND A HALF

02:07:17.296 --> 02:07:20.032
MONTHS. WE'VE SEEN IT EVEN HRE

02:07:20.099 --> 02:07:21.400
IN SACRAMENTO THERE QUALITIES

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:23.268
NOT FROM CARS AND TRUCKS AND

02:07:23.335 --> 02:07:26.205
CONCRETE PLANTS. IT'S FROM THE

02:07:26.271 --> 02:07:30.242
FOREST BURNING DOWN. MILLIONS

02:07:30.309 --> 02:07:33.312
ARE MILLIONS OF ACRES IT'S JUST

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:35.347
INCREDIBLE THAT WE CONTINUE TO

02:07:35.414 --> 02:07:37.483
REGULATE DRIVE THE COST OF

02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:39.251
LIVING UP IN CALIFORNIA TO HELP

TALK ABOUT THE REAL EMISSION

02:07:45.824 --> 02:07:47.126
PROBLEM AND THE REAL EMISSION

02:07:47.192 --> 02:07:50.763

IN THE BIG PICTURE BIG PICTURE

02:08:00.272 --> 02:08:02.107

POINT BUT MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:10:37.729 --> 02:10:39.498
CHINO IS FIRST AT 7% IS A

02:10:39.565 --> 02:10:42.201
MASSIVE AMOUNT. ALL BUILDINGS

OUR CARBON EMISSIONS TO LIKE 7%

02:10:47.472 --> 02:10:50.375
THAT'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT AND WE

HAVE TO FIND REALLY RESHAPE

02:10:51.677 --> 02:10:53.645
EACH ASPECT OF OUR ECONOMY AND

HARD TO DECARBONISE INDUSTRIES.

02:10:57.349 --> 02:10:58.317
AND IT'S A WEIRD PLACE TO MAKE

02:10:58.383 --> 02:10:59.518
A STAND BECAUSE INDUSTRIES

02:10:59.585 --> 02:11:01.119
ACTUALLY BEEN SUPPORTIVE

02:11:01.186 --> 02:11:02.254
INDUSTRY'S BEEN SUPPORT OF THIS

02:11:02.321 --> 02:11:03.355
BILL FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE

SOLUTION THEY'D RATHER BE PART

02:11:06.725 --> 02:11:08.694
OF THE SOLUTION. IN GETTING TO

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:09.194
ZERO RATHER THAN HAVING

02:11:09.261 --> 02:11:11.230
SOMETHING OPPOSED. THE IMPOSED

02:11:11.296 --> 02:11:13.232
UPON THEM. TO THEY'VE BEEN

02:11:13.298 --> 02:11:14.433
PARTNERS IN THIS.

02:11:14.499 --> 02:11:17.436
INITIALIZATION CALIFORNIA IS 1%

02:11:17.502 --> 02:11:18.904
OF THE WORLD'S. CARBON

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:21.039
EMISSIONS 1% SO YES EVERYTHING

02:11:21.106 --> 02:11:23.242

02:11:23.308 --> 02:11:24.710
REALLY MATTERS IS WHAT WE CAN

02:11:24.776 --> 02:11:25.944
TO PUT POLICIES IN PLACE IN

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:27.546
CALIFORNIA. THAT COULD BE

02:11:27.613 --> 02:11:29.548
EXPORTABLE POLICIES A PLACE IN

02:11:29.615 --> 02:11:31.516

BUT THAT'S NOT THE ITEM AT HAND

03:41:52.499 --> 03:41:54.300
RIGHT NOW I'M JUST SAYING THAT

03:41:54.367 --> 03:41:56.136

RIGHT BILL THERE WILL BE SOME

03:41:58.805 --> 03:41:59.806

DOLLARS IT'S GOING FOR FROM

03:42:24.764 --> 03:42:26.933

CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT JOHN.

03:42:54.227 --> 03:42:55.462
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I KNOW

03:42:55.528 --> 03:42:56.896
WHEN WE GET TO OUR DISTRICT

03:42:56.963 --> 03:42:58.898

03:44:45.738 --> 03:44:46.973
NEGOTIATIONS ARE PUT THIS ALL

03:44:47.040 --> 03:44:48.975

ARE IMPLICATIONS TO THIS THAT

03:59:31.623 --> 03:59:33.826

LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL OPINION

IMITATION BEHIND THOSE DAMS IS

03:59:55.881 --> 04:00:01.386
GONNA WORK. DOWNSTREAM. THEN

04:00:01.453 --> 04:00:01.854

ORGANIZATIONS WHO DEMANDED THAT

04:00:13.265 --> 04:00:15.834

04:00:15.901 --> 04:00:18.637
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY. WHEN

04:00:18.704 --> 04:00:21.907

PROBABLY SAY NOTHING. BUT IT IS

04:00:32.618 --> 04:00:35.354
VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE

FLOODED. THAT'S BEEN A QUIET

04:01:10.422 --> 04:01:11.490
ISSUE MOST PEOPLE DON'T TALK

04:01:11.557 --> 04:01:13.125
ABOUT THAT IT'S VERY REAL AND

04:01:13.192 --> 04:01:15.460
VERY REAL IN WHAT WE'RE DEALING

04:01:15.527 --> 04:01:18.664

04:01:18.730 --> 04:01:22.100

TRUCK. EVERY MINUTE. EVERY DAY

04:01:43.956 --> 04:01:46.758

04:01:46.825 --> 04:01:47.993
WOULD BE EXPECTED AND THAT'S

04:01:48.060 --> 04:01:51.096
NOT EVEN THE HIGH PROJECTION.

04:01:51.163 --> 04:01:54.800
THE SEDIMENTATION ACCUMULATED

04:01:54.867 --> 04:01:58.003

NOT LEAD TO THE INVESTMENT. BUT

04:02:26.131 --> 04:02:26.665
NOW THAT ENDED IS GOING TO TRY

04:02:26.732 --> 04:02:27.532

CONSEQUENCES THAT. ULTIMATELY

05:28:21.982 --> 05:28:24.184

THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT

05:53:51.677 --> 05:53:53.779
IS THAT AN EMPLOYER WOULD GO

05:53:53.845 --> 05:53:55.347

05:54:02.020 --> 05:54:03.822
LOWER RATE AND IT'S GONNA TAKE

05:54:03.889 --> 05:54:04.389
MORE WORK OR DO YOU BELIEVE

05:54:04.456 --> 05:54:06.224

05:54:21.373 --> 05:54:24.576
AS A COUNTRY- THERE ARE

05:54:24.643 --> 05:54:27.479
APPROXIMATELY TEN OTHER STATES

05:54:27.546 --> 05:54:28.714
THAT HAVE ALREADY GONE IN THIS

05:54:28.780 --> 05:54:30.315

05:54:45.530 --> 05:54:46.765
BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE

05:54:46.832 --> 05:54:50.569
DISABILITY COMMUNITY TO LOSE.

05:54:50.636 --> 05:54:53.271
OUT ON THAT DECISION. THAT IT

05:54:53.338 --> 05:54:54.272

05:54:59.411 --> 05:55:02.781
THE A MODEL OF MARYLAND- TO

05:55:02.848 --> 05:55:04.916
COME UP WITH. THESE KIND OF

05:55:04.983 --> 05:55:06.618
AMENDMENTS FOR EXAMPLE TO HAVE

05:55:06.685 --> 05:55:08.387
SELF ADVOCATES THOSE WHO

05:55:08.453 --> 05:55:10.589
ACTUALLY WORKED FOR SOME

05:55:10.656 --> 05:55:13.125
MINIMUM WAGE OUGHT TO BE ON THE

05:55:13.191 --> 05:55:14.893
ADVISORY SO WE COULD IT'S NOT

05:55:14.960 --> 05:55:16.528
ME TELLING THEM. BUT IT'S

05:55:16.595 --> 05:55:17.663
ACTUALLY THEY THEMSELVES

05:55:17.729 --> 05:55:20.532
PARTICIPATING- WE ALSO CHANGED

05:55:20.599 --> 05:55:23.535
IT TO SAY THAT A PHASE OUT PLAN

05:55:23.602 --> 05:55:25.437
WOULD BE DEVELOPED WITH ALL THE

05:55:25.504 --> 05:55:26.438
STAKEHOLDERS AND THEIR

05:55:26.505 --> 05:55:28.206
INVOLVEMENT SO WE'RE NOT

05:55:28.273 --> 05:55:29.941
LOOKING TO DO THIS FROM ONE DAY

05:55:30.008 --> 05:55:31.843
TO ANOTHER. IT WILL BE THREE

05:55:31.910 --> 05:55:34.146
YEARS WE WILL HAVE A PHASE OUT

05:55:34.212 --> 05:55:37.082
PLAN WE ARE NOT LOOKING OUT TO

05:55:37.149 --> 05:55:38.750
HURT ANYBODY'S CHANCES OF

05:55:38.817 --> 05:55:41.153
WORKING. BUT WE DO FEEL VERY

05:55:41.219 --> 05:55:44.322
STRONGLY THAT. WHEN THEY WORK

05:55:44.389 --> 05:55:45.390
THEY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO COUNT

05:55:45.457 --> 05:55:48.360
ON THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THIS

05:55:48.427 --> 05:55:50.495
STATE AND I KNOW NATIONALLY-

05:55:50.562 --> 05:55:51.930
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALSO

05:55:51.997 --> 05:55:53.298
LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION

05:55:53.365 --> 05:55:54.633
THAT'S BEEN THE CONVERSATION

05:55:54.700 --> 05:55:57.069
FOR A FEW YEARS SO- THE NUMBER

05:55:57.135 --> 05:55:58.336
OF EMPLOYERS WHO ARE USING

05:55:58.403 --> 05:56:01.106
THESE WAIVERS. HAS DECREASED

05:56:01.173 --> 05:56:04.109
EVERY YEAR HERE IN CALIFORNIA-

05:56:04.176 --> 05:56:06.945
AND THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO ARE

05:56:07.012 --> 05:56:08.947
WORKING UNDER SOME MINIMUM WAGE

05:56:09.014 --> 05:56:12.017
HAS ALSO DECREASED SO I BELIEVE

05:56:12.084 --> 05:56:13.985
WE ARE GOING IN THAT DIRECTION

05:56:14.052 --> 05:56:16.455
LET'S PLANET LET'S DO IT THE

05:56:16.521 --> 05:56:17.789
RIGHT WAY. WITH THE

05:56:17.856 --> 05:56:19.958
STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IF I IF I

05:56:20.025 --> 05:56:21.426
MAY JUST ASK ONE MORE FOLLOW UP

05:56:21.493 --> 05:56:26.198
WAS THERE ANY. STATISTICS.

05:56:26.264 --> 05:56:26.765
SHOWN IN THOSE OTHER STATES

05:56:26.832 --> 05:56:27.766
WHERE. THE EMPLOYER'S ACTUALLY

05:56:27.833 --> 05:56:29.568
DID NOT CONTINUE TO EMPLOY THEM

05:56:29.634 --> 05:56:31.103
BECAUSE THE WAGE WENT HIGHER

05:56:31.169 --> 05:56:32.504
MAYBE THAT'S A SIMPLE WAY OF

05:56:32.571 --> 05:56:36.675
ASKING THE QUESTION. I'M SORRY

05:56:36.742 --> 05:56:37.309

LOOKING AT IS- AND I'M JUST

05:56:46.384 --> 05:56:48.487
CONCERNED THAT. IF THE SKILL

05:56:48.553 --> 05:56:51.089
LEVEL IS NOT THERE TO MATCH THE

05:56:51.156 --> 05:56:53.125
ABILITY FOR THE WAGE THAT IT

05:56:53.191 --> 05:56:55.127
MAY BE ACTUALLY WORK IN REVERSE

THAT. THEY'RE NOT LEFT BEHIND

05:57:47.712 --> 05:57:50.382
THAT THEY'RE NOT LEFT WITHOUT-

05:57:50.448 --> 05:57:52.484
OR AT RISK OF LOSING THE DOES A

JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND THERE'S

05:57:53.785 --> 05:57:55.787
ALSO MONEY. I BELIEVE IN THE

05:57:55.854 --> 05:57:58.190

APPROXIMATELY SEVEN YEARS AGO

AND I LAMENT THE DAY DIDN'T

05:58:30.155 --> 05:58:32.390
PASS BECAUSE I'VE HAD

05:58:32.457 --> 05:58:34.826
EXPERIENCE WORKING- WITH THESE

05:58:34.893 --> 05:58:36.962
INDIVIDUALS HAVE HAD.

05:58:47.806 --> 05:58:50.108
FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON. IN OUR

05:58:50.175 --> 05:58:52.310
SOCIETY AND OUR ECONOMY THERE

05:58:52.377 --> 05:58:55.614
IS A PLACE. AND WE SHOULD NOT

05:58:55.680 --> 05:58:57.482
PUNISH THEM FOR BEING PART OF A

05:58:57.549 --> 05:59:00.352

TO ANY OTHER HUMAN BEINGS AND

05:59:06.524 --> 05:59:08.360
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT

05:59:08.426 --> 05:59:10.996
WE WOULD SINGLE THEM OUT. AND

05:59:11.062 --> 05:59:12.130
THIS IS A FORM OF

05:59:12.197 --> 05:59:13.932
DISCRIMINATION IN OUR SOCIETY

05:59:13.999 --> 05:59:16.201
THAT WE NEED TO END. THERE IS A

SOMEBODY COULD HAVE SOMETHING

05:59:28.980 --> 05:59:30.916
VERY SPECIAL TO CONTRIBUTE IN

05:59:30.982 --> 05:59:32.550
THIS ECONOMY AND WE COULD FIND

05:59:32.617 --> 05:59:35.220

SUCCESSFULLY IN OUR ECONOMY

06:00:07.852 --> 06:00:10.288
THIS IS OVERDUE. I HOPE WE

AND HAS A PROUD CO AUTHOR. I

06:00:47.926 --> 06:00:50.462
WAS I'M EXCITED TO HEAR IT WHEN

06:00:50.528 --> 06:00:51.596
IT CAME BEFORE US IN HUMAN

06:00:51.663 --> 06:00:56.167
SERVICES. AND I DON'T RECALL IF

06:00:56.234 --> 06:00:57.602
I SHARED THIS IN THE COMMITTEE

06:00:57.669 --> 06:01:02.707
BUT. MY STEP SON WAS DIAGNOSED

06:01:02.774 --> 06:01:08.013
WITH AUTISM. AND I AS A RESULT

06:01:08.079 --> 06:01:09.514
HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AT

06:01:09.581 --> 06:01:11.950
REGIONAL CENTERS GETTING TO

06:01:12.017 --> 06:01:14.652
KNOW OTHER PARENTS. ADULT

06:01:14.719 --> 06:01:16.454
CHILDREN AND YOUNG CHILDREN.

06:01:16.521 --> 06:01:19.224
WHO ARE ON THE SPECTRUM. AND

06:01:19.290 --> 06:01:21.159
LEARNING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS.

06:01:21.226 --> 06:01:24.195
TO LOVE SOMEONE AND TO WANT TO

06:01:24.262 --> 06:01:26.364
SEE THEM SUCCEED. WHO WAS ON

06:01:26.431 --> 06:01:29.934
THE SPECTRUM. AND ONE EVENING

06:01:30.001 --> 06:01:32.137
AT THE WESTSIDE REGIONAL CENTER

06:01:32.203 --> 06:01:34.339
I ENDED UP HAVING A DISCUSSION

06:01:34.406 --> 06:01:36.841
WITH THIS FATHER OF AN ADULT

06:01:36.908 --> 06:01:42.414
CHILD. WHO'S ON THE SPECTRUM.

06:01:42.480 --> 06:01:45.050
AND HE TALKED ABOUT HIS SON

06:01:45.116 --> 06:01:48.586
WANTING TO WORK. AND HAVING A

06:01:48.653 --> 06:01:52.991
REALLY HARD TIME FINDING WORK.

06:01:53.058 --> 06:01:56.561
BECAUSE OF HIS AUTISM. AND THE

06:01:56.628 --> 06:01:59.297
GLORIOUS MESS THAT CAME WHEN HE

06:01:59.364 --> 06:02:03.635
WAS ABLE TO SECURE HIM A JOB.

06:02:03.701 --> 06:02:06.838
AT A THEME PARK. AND HE TALKED

06:02:06.905 --> 06:02:08.640
ABOUT THE VALUE THAT COMES FROM

06:02:08.706 --> 06:02:15.814
WORK. THE VALUE THAT COMES FROM

06:02:15.880 --> 06:02:18.516
BEING THE VALUE. FROM BEING

06:02:18.583 --> 06:02:22.554
ABLE TO DO SOMETHING. CREATE

06:02:22.620 --> 06:02:28.426
SOME THINGS ARE SERVICE SOMEONE.

06:02:28.493 --> 06:02:30.528
THAT'S WHAT EVERY PARENT IS

06:02:30.595 --> 06:02:34.833
HOPING THEIR CHILD WILL FIND.

06:02:34.899 --> 06:02:37.669
REGARDLESS OF IF THEY ARE ON

06:02:37.735 --> 06:02:42.941
THE SPECTRUM OR NOT. I RECALL

06:02:43.007 --> 06:02:45.877
ANOTHER DISCUSSION THAT I HAD

06:02:45.944 --> 06:02:48.246
WITH AN ADVOCATE NAME HERALD

06:02:48.313 --> 06:02:53.017
AND HERALD SAID. I'M ON THE

06:02:53.084 --> 06:02:55.620
SPECTRUM AND I CAN TELL YOU

06:02:55.687 --> 06:02:59.023
WHAT THAT'S LIKE. THAT'S LIKE

06:02:59.090 --> 06:03:02.594
BEING IN A HAM RADIO IN AN FM

06:03:02.660 --> 06:03:06.331
DIGITAL WORLD. IT DOESN'T MEAN

06:03:06.397 --> 06:03:08.666
YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING IT

06:03:08.733 --> 06:03:10.401
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT WORTH

06:03:10.468 --> 06:03:13.905
THE SAME AS SOMEONE ELSE IT

06:03:13.972 --> 06:03:16.474

CAN'T TELL YOU. I CAN TELL YOU.

06:04:14.732 --> 06:04:17.936
THE BRILLIANCE THAT COMES. FROM

06:04:18.002 --> 06:04:20.271
BEING TOUCHED BY SOMEONE WHO IS

06:04:20.338 --> 06:04:25.543

VALUING OUR WORKERS. AND WE

06:04:40.558 --> 06:04:42.193
SHOULD NOT BE PLACING A LESSER

06:04:42.260 --> 06:04:45.697
VALUE ON THEM. BECAUSE THEY

06:04:45.763 --> 06:04:48.132
HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY

06:04:48.199 --> 06:04:48.666
OR BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE

THE PROGRAM CALLED AID TO THE

06:06:06.177 --> 06:06:08.279
DISABLED SO WE HAD MANY MANY

06:06:08.346 --> 06:06:10.415
PEOPLE WHO DID HAVE THE

06:06:10.481 --> 06:06:12.216
CHALLENGES ON ACROSS THE

06:06:12.283 --> 06:06:14.185
SPECTRUM CERTAINLY PHYSICAL

06:06:14.252 --> 06:06:16.287
MENTAL HANDED THE PHONE MINIMUM

06:06:16.354 --> 06:06:17.689
WAGE WAS REALLY A WAY TO

06:06:17.755 --> 06:06:20.091
INCENTIVIZE EMPLOYERS TO

06:06:20.158 --> 06:06:21.759
ACTUALLY EMPLOY THESE

06:06:21.826 --> 06:06:24.162
INDIVIDUALS AND I BELIEVE THE

06:06:24.228 --> 06:06:25.196
IDEA STARTED WITH PEOPLE WHO

06:06:25.263 --> 06:06:27.965
WERE. WORKING IN THE AREA

06:06:28.032 --> 06:06:29.033

THAT AND HAVE NOWHERE TO GO SO

06:06:39.711 --> 06:06:42.080
I THINK WE HAVE TO BALANCE HERE

06:06:42.146 --> 06:06:43.614
OF THE INCENTIVE VISITATION FOR

06:06:43.681 --> 06:06:46.250
EMPLOYERS AND THE OPPORTUNITY

06:06:46.317 --> 06:06:48.186
FOR THOSEEMPLOYERS TO HAVE

06:06:48.252 --> 06:06:51.622
KIND OF A GRADUAL- WAY TO HIRE

06:06:51.689 --> 06:06:53.157
SOMEONE ON SET MINIMUM WAGE

06:06:53.224 --> 06:06:54.959
TREATMENT AND MOVE THEM UP TO

06:06:55.026 --> 06:06:57.228
MINIMUM THE NINETY EVEN BEYOND

06:06:57.295 --> 06:06:57.995
BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE

06:07:10.007 --> 06:07:11.175
BUT I WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT

06:07:11.242 --> 06:07:13.344
WE TAKE AWAY THE INCENTIVE. SO

06:07:13.411 --> 06:07:14.412
THAT THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO

ABILITIES BECAUSE SHE CAN'T.

06:12:18.282 --> 06:12:19.650
WHICH IS WHY SHE NEEDS TO BE

06:12:19.717 --> 06:12:22.386
PROTECTED. IF MY DAUGHTER HAD

06:12:22.453 --> 06:12:24.355

PROTECTIONS. BUT SHE DOESN'T IT

06:12:40.838 --> 06:12:41.338
