OUR HEARING TODAY ON CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING MARKETS AND THE COVE IN NINETEEN IMPACTS THIS IS A JOINT HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY ASSEMBLYWOMAN- FRIEDMAN AS WELL AS THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON WASTE REDUCTION WHICH I CHAIR- SO THIS OF COURSE ISN'T ALWAYS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC IN CALIFORNIA. AND EVEN MORE SO WITH THE COVER NINETEEN IMPACTS WHICH ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN GREAT LENGTH TODAY- JUST SOME HOUSEKEEPING BEFORE YOU GET IT STARTED- BECAUSE THE COVER NINETEEN WE HAVE SOME- UNIQUE- HEARING RESTRICTIONS THAT EVERYONE'S WELL AWARE OF SELF SOME HERE SOME OF THE HEARING PROTOCOL INFORMATION.

SO GO ALLOW FOR ROBUST CONVERSATION WITH OUR MEMBERS WILL ALSO HOLD OUR QUESTIONS FOR ALL. THE SPEAKERS UNTIL THE END OF EACH PANEL- THANK YOU FOR YOUR- AND WILL NOW- PROCEED WITH WITH THE HEARING. AGAIN AS I SAID EARLIER A NUMBER OF. HELLO ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN AS WELL- WE NOW- HAVE A COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT'S IMPACTING ALL ASPECTS OF CALIFORNIA. CERTAINLY OUR RECYCLING MARKETS AND OUR PRACTICES HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED AS WELL- THIS IS HAD A RIPPLE EFFECT ON BEHAVIOR WITH MODIFICATIONS TO WASTE COLLECTION. AND MANAGEMENT THAT HAVE REALLY IMPACTED RECYCLING YEAH FOR THIS WE'VE HAD- POLICIES ACROSS THE GLOBE. IMPACTING THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF RECYCLING SO THIS IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TOPIC AS WE SPEAK TODAY. ON MONDAY WE HAD A BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT PLASTIC PLASTIC WASTE. AND THIS IS A FOLLOW UP WITH THE OVERALL- WAY STREAMING CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WE HAVE. LEGISLATION IN TWENTY TWENTY AND AGAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TRY TO AND INTERESTED MAKE RIGHT OUR RECYCLING IN CALIFORNIA. SO TODAY WE HAVE AN OVERVIEW FOR MARK CAL RECYCLED- CHIEF. WE HAVE A SECTION ON THE IMPACTS TO COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT. IN A SECTION ON IMPACTS TO MARKETS AND THEN PUBLIC COMMENTS SO- BEFORE IT BEGAN I WANT TO ASK OUR CULTURE TODAY. ASSEMBLYWOMAN LAURA FRIEDMAN IF YOU LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING. THANK. FIVE RT- FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ALL OF THE MEMBERS WHO ARE REMOTELY ASSIST EGGMAN THIS AND I KNOW THAT WE OTHERS TO ONE PASS- THIS IS A VERY FOR TOPIC I HEAR PASTA POLLUTION FROM I CAN SEE I ALMOST AS MUCH AS ANY ISSUE IN CERTAIN ANYONE WHO'S GOT A YOUNG CHILD IN THEIR HOME- GETS TO HEAR FROM THEM CONSTANTLY ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THEY SEE IN ARE BEING TAUGHT. AND YOU KNOW THEY ALSO QUESTIONS WHAT WAS IT LIKE BEFORE THERE WAS POLLUTION EVERYWHERE BEFORE ANIMALS FROM DYING IN THE OCEAN- FROM PLASTIC AND SO WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET A HANDLE ON THIS UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF PROBATIVE PARTS WE'VE BEEN GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN CALIFORNIA. WOULD INCREASE- PRIORITY. BUT AND I'M NOT. RIGHT START OVER TO MY ON NOW YEAH SORRY ALL RIGHT WELL I CAN'T POSSIBLY THAT OPEN ON I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THE HEARING AND FIRST SUSAN EGGMAN IN THE OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHO ARE JOINING US AS WELL AS THE OTHER PANELISTS- WE HAVE BEEN GOING IN A TERRIBLE DIRECTION WHEN IT COMES TO PLASTIC POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IN THE ENTIRE- WORLD AND THIS IS DEFINITELY CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF THE PUBLIC EYE HERE ABOUT PLASTIC POLLUTION FROM MY CONSTITUENTS CONSTANTLY I HEAR ABOUT IT FROM MY OWN DAUGHTER. I SEE THE EFFECTS OF PLASTIC POLLUTION ARE FARMING AND WE LEARNED TWO DAYS AGO ABOUT THE IMPACT ON OUR ON OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN HEALTH ANIMAL HELP ON ECO SYSTEMS AND HOW EVEN IF WE WERE TO STOP PRODUCING PLASTIC TOMORROW WE'D STILL HAVE LINGERING AFFECTS FROM MICROPLASTICS AND FROM. THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE THAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE SO FOR US TO NOT TAKE DRASTIC STEPS TO STOP THE CONTINUATION OF THAT OF THAT ECOLOGICAL DISASTER WOULD BE REALLY LEGISLATIVE MALFEASANCE WE'VE GOT TO ACT WE'VE GOT ACT THIS YEAR AND COBOTS MAKE IT A LOT MORE CHALLENGING AS PEOPLE ARE TAKING MORE MORE TAKEOUT ITEMS ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE PRODUCTS DELIVERED TO THEIR HOME IN NON RECYCLABLE PLASTICS. AND SO WE HAVE GOT TO REALLY COME TOGETHER AS A LEGISLATURE TO FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS THAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND THE REST OF THE WORLD CAN CAN FOLLOW- OR JOIN WITH US ON I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL LEAD TO THOUGHT AND LEGISLATION ACTION. FROM FROM CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU I. KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS JOINING US REMOTELY. WE HAVE ASSEMBLY WOMAN CRISTINA GARCIA AND ASSEMBLYWOMAN SUSAN EGGMAN JOINING US FROM THEIR DISTRICTS. IT WOULD EITHER OF YOU LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING BEFORE WE PROCEED. I WILL. I JUST LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE- TO THE CHAIRS FOR CONVENING US- I KNOW YOU HAVE ALL BEEN ATTENDING TO ISSUES AROUND RECYCLING FOR YEARS NOW. IN THE PANDEMIC HAS JUST YEAH YEAH IN MY OWN LIFE AND IN MY OWN COMMUNITY I SEE THE EFFECTS OF OVER THE PANDEMIC IS DONE- ON OUR SINGLE USE ITEMS ON OUR WIPES ON EVERYTHING THAT WE WORK SO HARD TO GET AWAY FROM THAT WERE NOW. RETURNING TO SO I'M I'M INTERESTED POWER STATION AND- I'M REALLY. LOOKING FOR SOME CONCRETE THINGS THAT THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP US CLIMB OUT OF THIS- LAST WEEK MOUNTAIN THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. THANK YOU. OKAY ASSEMBLYWOMAN CRISTINA GARCIA I KNOW YOU'RE THERE I'M NOT SURE IF YOU LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING BEFORE AGAIN. I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING. SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE OVERVIEW. FROM OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT CAL RECYCLE- ZOE HELLER. EIGHT GOOD MORNING IS MY- SLIDE SHOW EUROPE YES. ALL RIGHT LOOK GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TODAY VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE ON YOU'LL RECOGNIZE MUCH OF THE INFORMATION THAT I'M SHARING FROM MONDAY'S PLASTIC HEARING WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS FRAME IT IN CODE IMPACTS ON THE RECYCLING AND SOLID WASTE SYSTEM. ALL RIGHT NEXT SLIDE. SO THE DATA THAT I'M GOING TO SHARE IS AN ALL FROM TWENTY TWENTY- BUT WHAT IT DEMONSTRATES IS THAT MANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING TODAY. TODAY AS A RESULT OF COVERAGE- HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND WHAT CODE IS DONE IS IT'S FURTHER EXACERBATED THESE CHALLENGES RECYCLING HAS BEEN DECREASING STATEWIDE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WERE WITH ANOTHER ALL TIME HIGH OF 50% IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE RECYCLE 37% OF WHAT WE GENERATED IN CALIFORNIA. ALONG WITH DECLINING RECYCLING RATES THERE'S BEEN A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN GENERATION OF MATERIAL AND DISPOSAL. WE HAVEN'T SEEN TWENTY TWENTY RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL DATA YET BUT WE KNOW WE WON'T WON'T MEET AB THREE FORTY ONE SCHOOL OF NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT'S ENDING UP IN THE WASTE STREAM THIS PIE CHART OF THE FAMILIAR FROM MONDAY. BUT WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF PACKAGING AND PACKAGING RELATED MATERIAL IN THE WASTE STREAM HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. BOTH AS A PROPORTION OF ALL MATERIALS AND ALSO IS TOTAL TONNAGE. THE INCREASE IN BOTH PLASTIC AND PAPER PACKAGING. IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT'S DEMONSTRATING. THAT THE GENERATION OF THESE MATERIALS IS SURPASSING A RECYCLING SYSTEMS ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE MATERIALS. WILL HAVE ANOTHER WASTE CHARACTERIZATION BEGINNING IN THE TWENTY ONE. WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF HOW COLD IT IS IMPACTED DISPOSAL. WE'RE ALSO ADDING NEW MATERIAL TYPES LIKE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW MUCH WE'RE DISPOSING. AS WE'VE ALL WITNESSED AN INCREASE IN PP AND DISPOSAL CORRESPONDS WITH AN INCREASE IN PTP VETERAN TO OUR ENVIRONMENT. WE'VE ALSO SEEN THIS WITH THE INCREASE IN SINGLE USE PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS. ON WHAT IS SHIFTED HOW WE RECEIVE AND UTILIZE GOODS AND SERVICES WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS INCREASING GENERATION OKAY NEXT SLIDE. IN CALIFORNIA WE COUNT EXPORTED RECYCLABLES IS RECYCLED WE EXPORTED FRACTION OF OUR VOICESTREAM HISTORICALLY ACCOUNTED FOR UP TO A THIRD OF ALL MATERIALS RECYCLED IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS CHART. THE AMOUNT THAT WE'VE BEEN EXPORTING HAS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. AND ALTHOUGH THIS DECREASE HAS IMPACTED OUR OVERALL RECYCLING RATES IT'S A GOOD THING. MUCH OF WHICH WE ARE EXPORTING TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE MATERIALS THAT DID NOT HAVE TO MASTER MARKETS HERE WE HAVE NO WAY OF TRACKING WHEN WE EXPORT THOSE MATERIALS IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING RECYCLED ANOTHER. SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES IN THESE OTHER COUNTRIES. BACKSLIDE. SO ONCE AGAIN WE'RE GENERATING MORE MORE STUFF AND THESE CUTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTING STUFF. CHINA HAS A PENDING FOLLOW BASEBAND FOLLOWING THE NUMBER OF RESTRICTIVE POLICIES THAT THEY PUT FORWARD I'M ACCEPTING RECYCLABLE MATERIAL SINCE ABOUT TWENTY FOURTEEN. SOUTHEAST ASIA ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE AND THE TWO MAIN MATERIALS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE MIXED PLASTICS AND MIXED PAPER WHICH DON'T HAVE STRONG DOMESTIC MARKETS. THE BATTLE CONVENTION IS ADDING ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY ONE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER MIXED PLASTICS WHICH WILL IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO TRADE MIXED PLASTICS TO ANY OTHER COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY SINCE U. S. IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE BASIL CONVENTION. AND THEN COATED IN HAS COULD HAVE IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO MOVE MATERIALS TO SHIPPING LINES HAVE BEEN DISTRACTED AND MOST OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE SEEN HERE IN THE US FOR RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL ARE ALSO HAPPENING IN OTHER COUNTRIES. AROUND THE GLOBE. NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE MAJOR FACTOR CODE THAT WE'RE SEEING WELL THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IN APRIL TWO ADDRESSED ON THE RECYCLING CHALLENGES RESULTING FROM COVERAGE ZERO WAS INTRODUCED TO A LOT OF BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING CENTERS TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THEIR SIERRA BEAVER DAM SHOPPER OPERATIONS OR REDUCE OPERATING. HOURS IN ADDITION IT'LL TO AND RETAILERS TO TEMPER SO THEIR BEVERAGE CONTAINER BACK THE- OR ORDER. IT HALTED A OF USE OF THIS USE DISPOSABLE BAG BAN MANY GROCERS RETAILERS COULD. OFF OR SINGLE USE JUST BAG. AND AS A RESULT WE SEE INCREASE OF THOSE BOTH OUR ENVIRONMENT BEING TO. IN ALSO CONTAIN OUR- STREAM. THE IARC'S FIRED. BUT WE'RE STILL SOME OF IMPACT OF. THE RESTRICTIONS FROM. THE L. ON THE YEAR WAS ISSUE FROM ON NO ABOUT THE NINETEEN IT HOW TRANSIT. SINCE THE CAL OSHA HAS THE GUIDANCE FOR NON OF INTO. IN GROW STORES AND- INFORMATION ON REASON BACKS BE SAFE USED AND HAVE. CAN COULD BE SAFER. SOME RECYCLABLE FACILITIES TEMPORARY CLOSE DUE TO CAN ABOUT STATE. THAT'S ABOUT IF PEOPLE COULD NOT PRACTICALLY DO IN THOSE THIS. DURING THAT TIME SUMMERS. WENT TO WIN. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH BUT WE SHOULD GET A BETTER SENSE WHEN WE RECEIVE OUR DATA FROM TWENTY TWENTY RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL REPORTING SYSTEM. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE FACILITIES THAT HAD INITIALLY SHUT DOWN HAVE RE OPENED. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A REDUCTION IN COMMERCIAL RECYCLABLE COLLECTION IN AN INCREASE IN RESIDENTIAL RECYCLABLE COLLECTION WHICH IS A SURPRISE GIVING THE STATE HOME ORDER. AND THE CLOSURE OF BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SURE THERE'S BEEN ACROSS THE BOARD DECREASE AND RECYCLE. AND WITH THE TIGHT SUPPLY OF RECYCLED PAPER AND ON CARDBOARD THE PRICE OF RECOVERED PAPER INCREASED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE SPAN OF A FEW MONTHS. THE OPPOSITE IS HAPPENING FOR PLASTICS GLOBAL OIL PRICES HAVE DROPPED CAUSING THE PRICE THE VIRGIN PLASTICS TO DROP INCENTIVIZING THE USE OF VIRGIN PLASTIC OVER RECYCLED CONTENT. NEXT SLIDE. WE'VE SEEN AN IMPACT TO THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM WE INITIALLY SAW A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN RECYCLING VOLUME HOWEVER THE VOLUME HAS SLOWLY STARTED TO GO UP AS THE STATE HAS REOPENED. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY WE HAD ABOUT 80% RECYCLING RATE THIS ROPPED TO ABOUT 47% IN MARCH. AND IS NOW BACK UP TO THE LOW SEVENTIES ONCE AGAIN THIS IS PRELIMINARY DATA THIS DATA ISN'T MATURE BUT THESE ARE THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING. THE SALES INCREASE COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS BECAUSE OF COVERAGE OR EATING AND DRINKING OUT LAST AND INITIALLY PEOPLE WERE STOCKING UP ON GROCERIES AND BEVERAGES. TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY AT HOME. THE DECREASE IN RETURNS COULD BE DUE TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WITH THE TEMPORARY CLOSURES OF RECYCLING CENTERS IN THE SUBURBS THE SPEND A DEALER TAKE BACK REQUIREMENTS. SUMMERSIDE CENTERS DID NOT RE OPENED TO ECONOMIC OR STAFFING REASONS OR SAFETY CONCERNS. THERE'S ALSO VARIATION ACROSS THE STATE AND HOW GROCERS ARE ARE ON RESPONSIBLE FOR. REDEEMING BOTTLES AND CANS SOME GROCERS CAN OPT TO PAY A FEE TO THE DEPARMENT INSTEAD OF TAKING BACK CONTAINERS. HELLO RECYCLE RELEASED AB FIFTY FOUR REPORT TO PROVIDE OPTIONS TO ADDRESS BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING CHALLENGES. SOME OF THESE OPTIONS INCLUDED MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR REDUCTION ON THESE ACTIONS IN THE REPORT COULD HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE COVERT IMPACTS THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY THREE REQUIRING MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT IS A TIMELY AND IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE RECYCLED CONTENT- AND DRIVE DEMAND FOR THE CLEAN MATERIALS THAT THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. PRODUCES NEXT SLIDE. I MENTION THIS THIS CHART ON- ON MONDAY AND- IT'S REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT GIVES US A SENSE OF WHAT THE LONGER TERM IMPACTS COULD BE. LOOKING TOWARDS CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE DISPOSAL RECYCLING RATES IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT THIS CHART SHOWING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISPOSAL AND CHANGING JUST IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE VERY VERY CLOSELY TIED. ECONOMIC GROWTH THE GENERALLY MEANS INCREASED DISPOSAL THIS IS NOT THE ONLY FACTOR BUT IT PLAYS A ROLE. AS WE CONSIDER THE LONGER TERM IMPACTS TO COPE WITH NINETEEN CRISIS AND THE RECESSION WE'LL SEE IF THIS TREND CONTINUES AND IF DISPOSAL DECREASES CORRESPONDINGLY. NEXT SLIDE. SO THIS PART WILL ALSO LOOK FAMILIAR HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES WE'RE FACING TODAY COVERT RELATED AND OTHERWISE. AND I THINK THIS MODEL- STAYS RELEVANT FOR THIS CONVERSATION AS WELL. THE FIRST IS TO REDUCE WASTE. THE SECOND IS TO INCREASE YOUR USE COVERED NINETEEN HAS IMPACTED THE ABILITY- TO USE REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES TO DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING STATEWIDE. WE'RE SLOWLY SEEING THIS TREND REVERSES PUBLIC HEALTH DATA IS SHOWING THAT RESEMBLES CAN BE AFELY USED. WE NEED TO OPTIMIZE EXPAND INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO MANAGE OVER STILL GENERATING. WE NEED ON TOP THEM AS OUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND EXPAND APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE. RECYCLABLES ARE LOOKS. WE NEED TO DO A RESPONSE. AND SUPPORTIVE POLICIES ALSO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE HERE- I MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF MINERAL CONTENT RISK LEGISLATION POLICIES THAT SUPPORT SOURCE REDUCTION. MORE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANY FACTORS THAT ARE BRINGING THESE MATERIALS INTO THE STATE THESE CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN ON THE REPAIRS AND THE JURISDICTIONS OUT THIS INCREASED GENERATION IS OVERWHELMING RECYCLING AND SOLID WASTE. ALSO POLICIES THAT SUPPORT ENSURING THAT WE'RE GENERATING IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE COULD HELP US SEE A REDUCTION IMPACTS FROM KOBE. AND THE OVERALL SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING CHALLENGES. NOW MY FINAL SLIDE. ON SOME OF WHAT'S AHEAD WILL HELP US ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED COVER. THE RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL REPORTING SYSTEM WILL GIVE US A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF RECYCLABLE MATERIAL FLOW AND DISPOSAL THAT WE CAN BETTER MANAGE AND TRACK THE IMPACT THE CODED. ORGANICS DIVERSION TO THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE WILL HELP US REACH UR RECYCLING GOALS WHILE REDUCING SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS BUT WHERE IT'S MOST RELEVANT TO. COVER NINETEEN IMPACTS THERE'S A FEDERAL FOOD RESCUE COMPONENT THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS HUNGER ESCALATING STATEWIDE THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE REQUIRES US TO RESCUE EDIBLE FOOD TO HELP PROVIDE MEALS FOR THE ONE IN FOUR CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE FOOD INSECURE. SB THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE RIGHTS WILL BE FINALIZED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND THEY WILL DEFINE RECYCLABLE REUSABLE AND COMPOSTABLE. FOODSERVICE PACKAGING IN STATE FACILITIES AND ALL REQUIRE THAT THESE MATERIALS ARE ACTUALLY RECYCLED REUSED OR COMPOSTED. THESE DEFINITIONS COULD HAVE BROADER APPLICABILITY IF WE SEE COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGING REQUIRED IN CALIFORNIA. SO IN CLOSING OVERCOMING THE CHALLENGES THAT CODE HAS BROUGHT TO THE SOLID WASTE RECYCLING SYSTEM WILL TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH ONE THAT ADDRESSES ALL COMPONENTS OF THE RECYCLING AND SOLID WASTE SYSTEM. REDUCING WASTE INCREASING MANUFACTURER SPONSOR BILITY SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROCESS WE'RE STILL GENERATING THESE ARE ALL CRITICAL TO MEETING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND PROGRESSING TOWARDS. A MORE CIRCULAR ECONOMY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENT. I KNOW WE'LL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR FROM YOU- AND COUNTY CYCLE IT GO. AND IF YOU BELONG. TO FURTHER OKAY I KNOW YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT- WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE GLOBE SPECIFICALLY IN ASIA AND OF COURSE THE LAST YEAR'S ALL THAT KIND OF. THE OTHER SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES- AND- THAT HAVE AN IMPACT AS WELL I JUST WANTED TO ASK TWO QUESTIONS ON WHERE AT THE RECYCLING AND PUT IT NINETEEN. AS FAR AS THE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ON RECYCLING EXPORTS. WHAT SPECIFICALLY HAS COVERED NINETEEN DONE TO IMPACT THOSE- SO I DON'T THINK HOPE IT'S ACTUALLY IMPACTED THE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS I THINK WHAT IT'S DONE IS IT'S- REALLY MAGNIFIED THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH MOVING HARD TO RECYCLE MATERIAL AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASED GENERATION THAT WE'RE SEEING. OF MATERIALS THAT WE TRADITIONALLY EXPORTED SO FOR EXAMPLE SINCE THERE AREN'T MANY DOMESTIC MARKETS FOR PLASTICS THREE THROUGH SEVENTH WHICH MAKE UP A LOT OF OUR OUR ON PACKAGING IN SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO MOVE THOSE PRODUCT THOSE ON RECYCLABLES TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH MEANS WERE. E HAVE A CHALLENGE TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT EITHER HOW TO MANAGE THEM HERE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO MESS TO CONCUR STRUCTURE OR REDUCE THE GENERATION OF THOSE MATERIALS SO THAT THEY DON'T CREATE CHALLENGES IN OUR RECYCLING SYSTEM. OKAY AND THEN SECONDLY WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE LONG TERM. IMPACTS AS FAR AS KOBE NINETEEN AND A RECYCLING SYSTEM. OR WILL JUST GET BACK TO WHERE WE WORK WHICH FRANKLY WASN'T GOOD IN THE FIRST PLACE AS WILL GET AS ALL GET ONTO BUT- HOW MUCH MORE. OF A CHALLENGES ARE RECYCLING GONNA BE AFTER THIS CALL THE NINETEEN AREAS IS COMPLETED BECAUSE OF COVER NINETEEN. IT'S REALLY GOING TO DEPEND ON A LOT OF FACTORS ON THE FIRST IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH GENERATION. OVERALL IS A RESULT OF COVERT ARE WE GOING TO DECREASE GENERATION IN CALIFORNIA AND WE JUST DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PREVIOUS DATA. TO SHOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH A GLOBAL PANDEMIC- SO IT'S HARD TO SAY BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR THE INCREASED AND ON THE RESIDENTIAL RECYCLING STREAM. AND THE CHANGE OF BEHAVIOR MEANING THAT- INCREASED AND GENERATION OF THE SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING. IS REALLY STRAINING OUR SYSTEM ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH ON THE RESIDENTIAL- RECYCLING STREAM IS IT'S NOT AS CLEAN AS THE COMMERCIAL RECYCLING STREAM WHICH MEANS THAT PUTS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON OUR SYSTEM. TO HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT THOSE MATERIALS TO CREATE CLEAN BELLS THAT ARE ACTUALLY MARKETABLE. SO WHAT WE'LL SEE IS MORE OF THAT MATERIAL GOING TO DISPOSAL BECAUSE OF CONTAMINATION IN THE SYSTEM. SO THE CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO BE PROBABLY LESS ABILITY TO RECYCLE MATERIALS AND REALLY CHALLENGE US TO THINK FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. HOW TO GET A HANDLE ON ON WHAT WE'RE GENERATING AND HAVE A REALLY A LINE THAT WITH THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE WANT TO STAY IN THE STATE. OKAY THANK YOU. BILL. SO IF I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO REDUCE WASTE AND SO MANY DIFFERENT FRONTS WHETHER IT'S INDIVIDUAL PLASTICS AS WELL AS YOU HAVE PACKAGING- WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR- YOU KNOW THOUGHTS RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW WE COULD. HELP HOW WE REALLY SHOULD BE- MANAGING THAT CONVERSATION OBISPO SORT OF PUSHING THE ENVELOPE ON THOSE ISSUES. YEAH THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND- YOU KNOW. WE REALLY THINK MINIMUM CONTENT IS A GREAT START BECAUSE IT HELPS ENSURE THAT THAT MATERIALS ACTUALLY STAY IN THE SYSTEM AND THAT WERE UTILIZING. THE RECYCLABLE MATERIAL THAT WERE THAT WERE GENERATING BUT BUT YOU ASKED ALSO SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SOURCE REDUCTION AND HOW WE ENCOURAGE MORE MORE SOURCE REDUCTION IN THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT. IT'S DEPENDENT ON TWO THINGS ONE IS- IS OVERALL BEHAVIOR CHANGE OF THE CONSUMER HOW CAN WE HAVE MORE OPTIONS THAT THAT ENCOURAGE SOURCE REDUCTION THAT ENCOURAGE LESS USING LESS MATERIALS. AND THE OTHER IS ON MANUFACTURE RESPONSIBILITY ENSURING THAT MANUFACTURERS ARE ARE DESIGNING ON PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING THAT THAT ARE REUSABLE THAT- ALIGNED WITH THE SYSTEM BETTER BUT- REDUCING GENERATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THEN ENSURING THAT WHAT WE'RE GENERATING. REUSING RECYCLED CONTENT AND THAT- IT ACTUALLY IS RECYCLABLE COMPOSTABLE OR REUSABLE SO THAT IT DOESN'T HELP THE OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT WE'RE SEEING THESE PRODUCTS HAVE. YOU MAJORED. POSSIBILITY I THINK IS AN EXCELLENT POINT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. IF YOU TALK TO CONSUMERS. CONSUMERS WILL ALWAYS TAKE CONVENIENCE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING IT'S IN EVERYTHING IS DRIVEN TO. BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR CONSUMERS WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT'S SORT OF ONE OF A COMPANY'S JOB IS TO DO. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS THE PRICE OF THE CONVENIENCE IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT REALLY BEING FACTORED IN. SO HAVE WE SEEN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE THERE ARE. OTHER PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. START TO FACTOR THAT PRICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION INTO THAT CONVENIENCE. YEAH IN END- THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET IT THAT THERE'S ADVANCED DISPOSAL FEES ON THEIR SHREW ON EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAMS WHERE- THE MANUFACTURERS ARE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING OF THOSE PRODUCTS- THERE'S A NUMBER OF MODELS THAT HAVE VERY SUCCESS ON DEPENDING ON ON THE UNIVERSAL PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING THAT THAT THEY ADDRESSED AND HOW THOSE ON HOW THOSE MODELS ARE ARE IMPLEMENTED SO. FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE BIG BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM WHICH HAS ITS CHALLENGES BUT IS ALSO- YOU KNOW HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AS FAR AS KEEPING A RELATIVELY HIGH RECYCLING RATE AND DELIVERING THAT THAT CLEAN MATERIAL THAT CAN BE. RE MANUFACTURED INTO OTHER BOTTLES AND CANS OR OTHER PRODUCTS SO- IN THERE'S ALSO ARE I DO WANNA MENTION THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY INITIATIVES RIGHT NOW- THE ELLEN MACARTHUR ON A GLOBAL PLASTICS PACT FOR EXAMPLE IS ONE WHERE THERE IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT FROM INDUSTRY TO INCREASE RECYCLING RATES TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THAT THEY'RE USING TO INCREASE RECYCLED CONTENT BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW IF THOSE. IF THE ON OUTCOMES OF THOSE- INITIATIVES WILL DELIVER WHAT. WE NEED TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON THIS ISSUE. ARE THERE STATE SIR OR COUNTRIES YOU FEEL LIKE HEY SHOULD REALLY. TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN TERMS OF- YOUR TICKET TO GET IDEAS FOR US. DEFINITELY AND IT'S KIND OF DEPENDENT ON ON WHERE YOU WANT TO LOOK YOU KNOW FOR BOTTLE BILL FOR EXAMPLE ON THERE'S A REASON WHICH ORG AND ON. YOU KNOW OTHER COUNTRIES ARE IMPLEMENTING THEIR PROGRAMS WHERE THEY'RE SEEING SUCCESS THERE BUT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT IN CALIFORNIA BUT I STILL THINK THAT THERE'S ON ELEMENTS OF THOSE PROBLEMS PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT FOR. SURE THINKING ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN PROVE BOTTLE BILL AND SOME OF THOSE ARE- INVITED IN ALREADY FIFTY FOUR REPORT AND IN THE ACKNOWLEDGE WHERE WE SEE THOSE STRENGTHS IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHEN IT COMES TO PACKAGING. ON THIS IS A MERGING YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT EUROPEAN UNION IS ON IS IMPLEMENTING- ARE YOU KNOW. REDUCTION ALL PRODUCTS ARE- BRISK. HAS EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM AND THERE'S ELEMENTS OF ALL OF THOSE MODELS THAT THAT. COULD HAVE COULD BE SUCCESSFUL HERE IT'S JUST. WOULD HAVE TO DESIGN THEM FOR HOW THINGS WORK IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A LOT OF LOCAL CONTROL OF ON THE RECYCLING COLLECTION SYSTEMS WHICH HAS WORKED IN CALIFORNIA SO HOW DO WE ALIGN THESE MODELS. THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER COUNTRIES WITH THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA TO OPTIMIZE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO HELP US TAKE ON MORE AGGRESSIVELY SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT THAT WE'VE SEEN STATEWIDE. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR MENTIONING MINIMUM CONTENT AND IN THE BONNEVILLE- IT'S FELT LIKE WE WERE LONG OVERDUE FROM DOING. BOTTLE BILL REFORM AND I JUST WANTED TO GET A SENSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S POINT OF VIEW- WHAT YOUR HEAD IS AROUND POTENTIAL REFORM OF. BOTTLE BILL BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE. EVERY YEAR WEEK SORT OF TEETER ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER WHEN THE RECYCLING RATES GET WELL. GET GET. TOTAL SO. JUST CURIOUS WHERE THE WHERE THE DEPARTMENT'S THINKING ABOUT BOTTLE BILL AND- WHAT KINDS OF REFORMS WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING. SURE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO WE'RE WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE ON AB FIFTY FOUR PILOT PROJECTS THAT WE'VE AWARDED. THAT ARE ON JURISDICTIONS ARE ARE PARTNERING WITH RECYCLERS TO. PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBLE OPTIONS FOR CONVENIENCE AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE BROADER APPLICATION THAT THOSE CAN HAVE WHEN THEY DEMONSTRATE SUCCESS AND I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE A BROKEN RECORD HERE BUT THE AB FIFTY FOUR PORT WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THERE. PARTICULARLY AROUND FLEXIBILITY- FOR- REDEMPTION OPTIONS ARE CRITICAL FOR CONVENIENCE STATEWIDE TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS CAN GET THEIR NICKELS AND DIMES BACK IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO VERY EXCITED ABOUT HOW THESE PILOT PROJECTS WILL WILL- UNFOLD AND THEN WITH THAT. HOW THAT COULD HAVE BROADER APPLICABILITY STATEWIDE AS AS WE PUT FORTY MAYBE FIFTY FOUR REPORT PERFECT AND THEN THE MONEY WINDSOR PUTS A REPORT COMING OUT AGAIN I FORGOT I MUST'VE MISSED NOT HER THAT SACRIFICE- THE QUARTERLY. YES REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE- YEAH AND THERE WAS A LARGE I'M FORGETTING THE BILL NUMBER LAST SESSION THAT HAS TO CHANGE THAT TO ON BIANNUAL BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS- ON OUR WEBSITE WE'RE NOW RELEASING MONTHLY REPORTS THAT ARE NOT MATURE DATA SO YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW THAT ITS PRELIMINARY DATA BUT WHAT IT DOES HELP US SEE AS TRENDS IN THE STOMACH SO IT SHOWS. YOU KNOW RETURNS ON AND SALES TO HELP US GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CODES IMPACTING THE SYSTEM IN A MORE- UP TO DATE SNAPSHOT OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROGRAM PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. SIX THANK YOU. SOME A MEMBER FOR FRIEDMAN THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AGAIN TODAY- FOR SECOND OF THESE TWO HEARINGS I HAVE A TECHNICAL QUESTION WHICH IS IF YOU HAVE A ARM BOTTLE OR A CLAM SHELL OR ANY OTHER- BIT OF PLASTIC- PACKAGING THAT IS BEEN RECYCLED SO LET'S SAY IT'S MADE OUT OF A 100% RECYCLED CONTENT. CAN THAT. CAN I PACKAGE BE RECYCLED YET AGAIN HOW MANY TIMES CAN PLASTIC TO. BE RECYCLED. YOU KNOW- I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT ANSWER I DO KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW P. T. NH DA ARE ABLE TO BE RECYCLED MANY TIMES BUT I COULDN'T TELL YOU THE EXACT AMOUNT OF TIME- WITH PAPER IT'S MORE CHALLENGING BECAUSE EACH TIME PAPERS RECYCLED THE FIBERS GET A LITTLE BIT SHORTER. SO THEIR ABILITY TO BE TURNED INTO ON ANOTHER PAPER PRODUCT EMISSIONS WITH EACH TIME THAT THEIR RECYCLED BUT WITH THAT SAID YOU KNOW THEY STILL THE ON FOR EXAMPLE COPY PAPER ON COULD BE RECYCLED BACK INTO COPY PAPER A NUMBER OF TIMES BEFORE WOULD HAVE TO BE. YOU KNOW DOWNGRADED TO ON A LOWER GRADE PAPER SO IT'S REALLY DEPENDENT ON THE MATERIAL TYPE AND I CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH- WITH MORE DETAILS ON PLASTICS YEAH I'D LIKE SOME SOME INFORMATION BECAUSE I'VE SEEN CONFLICTING INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ABOUT WHAT IT CAN BE RECYCLED INTO AND HOW MANY TIMES- THAT YOU KNOW SO BE GOOD TO GET SOME CLARITY. FROM FROM CAL RECYCLE ABOUT SOME OF THOSE TECHNICAL- DIFFICULTIES OR CHALLENGES- YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS REALLY A QUESTION BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. FOR MANY YEARS- INDUSTRY HAS BEEN. REALLY PUSHING RECYCLING AS AS YOU WOULD WANT TO CERTAINLY AND- THEN PROMOTING THE IDEA THAT WHEN PLASTIC GETS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S THE FAULT OF THE CONSUMERS THAT THEY DON'T BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T BEHAVING WELL. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT TRUE BECAUSE EVEN WHEN PEOPLE PROPERLY DISPOSE OF RECYCLED PRODUCTS MANY TIMES THEY'RE NOT RECYCLE BECAUSE THERE'S NO MARKET FOR THEM OR IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE AND THE VERY SAME INDUSTRIES. THAT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE LITTER BLAME THE LETTER. I FOR THE LACK OF RE. OR THE ONES THEMSELVES WHO ARE NOT WILLING TO PAY EXTRA MONEY. TO USE THE RECYCLED CONTENT SO IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE EXTREMELY DISINGENUOUS. TO SAY THAT IT'S CONSUMERS. OR A LACK OF INVESTMENT FROM GOVERNMENT THAT'S CREATING THE PROBLEM BUT WE OURSELVES DON'T WANT TO BE ANY PART OF THE SOLUTION WE DON'T WANNA PAY A COUPLE EXTRA SENSE. FOR MORE EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OR BOTTLE THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT- SO- I FIND THAT VERY INTERESTING- AND- YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT. YOU LOOKING AT YOUR GRAPH ABOUT THINGS BEING RECYCLED. WE HAVE BEEN TELLING CONSUMERS FOR YEARS THAT ALL THESE PRODUCTS ARE RECYCLABLE IN THAT MESSAGE TO CONSUMERS AS EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF PLASTIC CAN BE RECYCLED ME MY HUSBAND. WE WILL TAKE THE RAPPER OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND PUT IT IN THE RECYCLE BIN IS THIS RECYCLABLE. RIGHT NOW YEAH OKAY BUT HE THINKS IT IS BECAUSE WE TELL PEOPLE THAT THIS IS ALL RECYCLABLE THEN THEY CONTAMINATE THE WAY STREAMING MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT SO WE TALK ABOUT WHAT CONSUMERS WANT CONSUMERS DON'T KNOW THAT THE THINGS THAT THEY THINK ARE BEING RECYCLED ARE NOT BEING RECYCLED AND I THINK WERE VASTLY UNDERESTIMATING. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC AND THEIR DESIRE TO HAVE A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF THE LAND TO BE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE TELLING THEM THESE PRODUCTS ARE AND WILL YOU HAVE A BLUE BIN AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS THROW THIS STUFF IN THE BLUE BIN AND YOU'VE DONE YOUR PART. SO THIS IS THIS FICTION THAT'S BEEN CREATED. BY INDUSTRY AND BY US. AND IT THE RESULT IS MOUNTAINS OF. PLASTIC AND ARE FILLING UP OUR LANDFILLS PEOPLE WANT TO LANDFILLS NEAR THEM CLOSED THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. THEY'RE DOING ALL THIS RECYCLING WEISS'S LANDFILL STILL FILLING UP. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. I WAS ABSOLUTELY. YEAH YES AND- MEANWHILE INDUSTRY COMPLAINS THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO PAY MORE IF THEY SWITCH TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PACKAGING WHERE IF THEY USE MORE PACKAGING IF IT'S CLASSES HAVE YEAR TO COST MORE THE PRODUCTS. BUT WE'RE ALSO NOT CLEARLY TELLING THE PUBLIC THAT THEY ARE PAYING THE COST OF NOT JUST THE PLASTIC POLLUTION BUT THEY'RE PAYING THE COST OF DIVERSION THAT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTED IN THEIR UTILITY BILL IN THEIR SWER FEE AND THEIR LANDFILL FEES AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO PASS ON TO THEM THE RATE PAYERS. SO EVEN IF YOU BUY NO PLASTIC EVEN IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO. NEVER ORDERS FROM AN ONLINE SOURCE WHO GOES OUT OF THEIR WAY TO BUY GLASS. PACKAGING YOU'RE STILL PAYING AS MUCH AS SOMEONE WHO. IS BUYING TONS AND TONS OF PLASTIC SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE. SO IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'VE- PASSED CONTINUE TO PROMOTE THIS FICTION ABOUT. THIS MAGIC BLUE BIN OR WHATEVER COLOR IT IS IN YOUR COMMUNITY WHERE ALL THE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED AND WE HAVE TO STOP PROMOTING THAT FICTION WE HAVE TO GET REAL WITH THE WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC. AND I THINK THAT YOU WOULD SEE- REAL BACKLASH OF PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING HERE SO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT THAT'S FINE IF YOU DON'T THAT'S FINE TOO. I JUST I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU THERE'S BEEN AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION. OF OUR SYSTEM WHERE. YOU YOU PRINTED IT PERFECTLY WHERE. YOU KNOW WE DROP SOMETHING IN OUR BLUE BIN AND WE MAGICALLY EPECT THAT IT GETS TURNED INTO SOMETHING ELSE WHEN THERE'S- A COMPLEX PROCESS THAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT WERE OFTENTIMES. THESE MATERIALS THAT PEOPLE ARE HOPING OR WISHING GET THAT GET RECYCLED ARE CONTAMINATING THE RECYCLING THE RECYCLING SYSTEM. SO THERE'S A COMPONENT MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBILITY THAT NEEDS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- JUST WANTED TO GIVE A QUICK. PLUG FOR ON AN INITIATIVE THAT COLOR CYCLES TAKING ON. WE'RE DOING ON A THREE YEAR ON FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN THAT WE JUST RECENTLY LAUNCHED. AND IT'S GOING TO FOCUSED ON ON COMMUNITY BASED SOCIAL MARKETING. IN WORKING WITH JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO HELP ON BETTER UNDERSTAND. WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AS FAR AS ON. GETTING THE CORRECT ITEMS IN THE BLUE BAND TO ENSURE THAT. WERE ONLY PUTTING RECYCLABLES IN THE BLUE BAND AND WHAT BEHAVIOR CHANGES NEEDED SO THAT WE CAN. CLEAN UP THE STRAIN YOU KNOW. SUCCESSFUL ON A SUCCESSFUL SYSTEM IS REALLY BASED ON A NUMBER OF PRINCIPLES AND- WE TEND TO LOSE SIGHT IN THESE CONVERSATIONS OF THE REDUCING REUSING. TO YOUR POINT THOSE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND TRUST WE NEED TO FOCUS ON GENERATE STUFF AND WE'RE STILL GENERATING WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IT REALLY ALIGNS WITH THE SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA. SO IT'S NOT CONTAMINATING SYSTEMS AND CREATING THIS. ADDITIONAL COST AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON. THE REPAIR AND ON JURISDICTIONS. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER PANELISTS WHO WANT TO JOIN US TODAY SO WILL WILL BE ASKED TO IS EITHER THE ONLY WOMAN AG MAN OR GARCIA WE HAVE ANY. QUESTIONS FOR THESE FOR THIS PANEL FROM THE CAR RECYCLE I JUST LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT IF I COULD SURE. YEAH I JUST I MEAN I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION BUT MY SOCIAL WORK HEART ALSO WANTS US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT BLAMING PEOPLE RIGHT NOW WHEN THEY ARE. WHEN WE ARE WE'RE LIVING IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC EVERYBODY'S TRYING O THEIR BEST TO STAY SAFE TRY TO THE BEST TO KEEP YOUR FAMILY SAFE- SO. I JUST THINK IT THE ONUS IS UPON US- AND I AND I DID SOME LEGISLATION LAST YEAR TO HOPEFULLY TRY TO STREAMLINE THE CURBSIDE RECYCLING BECAUSE I THINK. YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST AND WE NEED TO MAKE THE PROCESS A LOT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO RECYCLE WHAT GOES INTO WHAT GOES OUT THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE. AS COMPLICATED AS IT IS AND I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US. AS POLICY MAKERS AND AS HOPEFULLY IN A INDUSTRY LEADERS- ARE ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO. I MEAN WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO HOLD PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR HOMES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO. KEEP THEIR FAMILY FED- TO ALSO HOLD THEM ULTIMATELY SHOULD RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE RECYCLED CONTENT THAT IS NOW BEING FLOODED INTO OUR SYSTEM SO I JUST WANT TO BE ON THE ON THE RECORD FOR SAYING. IT IS FANTASTIC THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REDUCE IT AND I THINK WE MUST BUT I ALSO REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO PUT THE ONUS ON THE OTHER END OF THE WE STREAM RIGHT NOW. THEN ON THE CONSUMER TRYING TO DO THEIR THEIR VERY BEST. WELL SAID THANK YOU. OKAY WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE PANEL NOW ABOUT THE IMPACTS TO COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT. WE'RE GONNA START WAS SUSAN COLLINS PRESIDENT OF CONTAINER. RECYCLING INSTITUTE. HI GOOD MORNING. GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION- I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT HOW THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED RECYCLING COLLECTION PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA MY EXPERTISE IS IN CALIFORNIA'S BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING LAW SO I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING MORE TO THOSE- COMMODITIES AND THAT PROGRAM THAN ANYTHING ELSE BUT I WANT TO GIVE ONE REALLY BIG OBSERVATION HERE WHICH IS THAT IN MY THIRTY YEARS BEING IN THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY THIS HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST FASTEST SHIPPED AND MATERIAL TYPES THAT I'VE EVER SEEN THIS YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY- WE'VE BEEN MONITORING THE CHANGES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND WE'VE EVEN DEDICATED- PAGE ON OUR WEBSITE JUST TO TRACKING THE CHANGES IN COLLECTION PROGRAMS- FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THAT THE WAY THAT THEY WERE ALL INTERRUPTED TEMPORARILY I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN AND THAT WE'VE ALL SEEN PROBABLY IS THAT TAKE OUT PACKAGING HAS INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY AS THE DINE IN RESTAURANTS HAVE TRIED TO SHIFT TO TAKE OUT RESTAURANTS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THEIR BUSINESS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN CHANGES AND BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT MOST CONSUMERS PROBABLY ARE NOT AWARE OF AND IS- HE SAID KOBE NINETEEN HAS EXACERBATED PROBLEMS IN THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY THAT ALREADY EXISTED WE TOOK A DEEP DIVE INTO THE DATA TO FIGURE OUT WHICH CHANGES WERE DUE TO THAT WERE ALREADY EXISTING AND WE'RE CONTINUING TRENDS AND WHICH TRENDS WERE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC AND SO THE LAST TWO SLIDES IN MY PRESENTATION ARE GONNA LOOK AT THAT MORE DEEPLY. I TALKED ABOUT A PERMANENT SHIFT IN MATERIAL TYPES OR MAYBE SEMI PERMANENT. ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT ALUMINUM CANS HAVE SEEN A HUGE INCREASE MORE PEOPLE ARE STAYING AT HOME AND WE'RE WORKING AT HOME. AND ALUMINUM CANS OF THE MOST POPULAR TYPE OF CONTAINERS FOR AT HOME USE PARTLY OWING TO THE EASE OF STORAGE OF TWELVE PACKS AND SIX AND TWENTY FOUR PACKS AND REFRIGERATORS- AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T IN RESTAURANTS THEY'RE NOT CONSUMING. DRAFT BEER THAT COMES OUT OF CAKES THEY'RE NOT CONSUMING FOUNTAIN DRINKS THAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY CONSUME IN RESTAURANTS OR TAKE OUT PLACES. SO THAT HAS LAGGED INTERESTINGLY TO A COMPLETE DISRUPTION OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN THERE HAS LITERALLY BEEN A SHORTAGE OF ALUMINUM CANS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CRAFT BEER INDUSTRY WAS UP ENDED OVERNIGHT WITH CLOSURES OF BARS AND RESTAURANTS BECAUSE 50% OF THEIR BUSINESS WAS DRAFT BEER AND CAKES. THEY LITERALLY HAD TO THROW OUT BEER AND COORDINATE WITH MUNICIPAL SEWER SYSTEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DIDN'T OVERLOAD SYSTEMS- SO SOME OF THEIR THEIR DECADE BUSINESS WAS DOWN NEARLY A 100% OVERNIGHT WHEN THE PANDEMIC STARTED IN MARCH. AND SO THE SHIFTED DRINKING AT HOME BECAUSE IS MORE NEED FOR BOTTLES AND CANS. THAT HAS LED TO WHAT WE THINK IS A 6% UPTICK. SEMI PERMANENT UPTICK IN THE USE OF- BOTTLES AND CANS SALES OF PACKAGED BEVERAGES IN IT THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THERE WAS A FURTHER DISRUPTION OF THE I'M SORRY SLIDE TO PLEASE GO TO NEXT SLIDE THERE WAS A FURTHER DISRUPTION IN THE RECYCLING SUPPLY CHAIN AS A RESULT OF THE SUSPENSION OF THE DEPOSIT RETENTION PROGRAMS AND ALL TEN STATES. BUT FIRST I HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS. NOT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS KEY FACT THAT CONTAINERS THAT ARE ON DEPOSIT DATA TREMENDOUS INCENTIVE. TO TAKE BACK YOUR BOTTLES AND CANS LIKE THE C. R. V. PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THOSE PROGRAMS ONLY EXIST IN TEN STATES. THIS CHART SHOWS HOW DRAMATICALLY HIGHER. THE RECYCLING RATES ARE FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ON DEPOSIT THIRTY TWO OR THREE TIMES SOMETIMES EVEN FOUR TIMES AS HIGH. AS THE CONTAINERS THAT ARE NOT ON DEPOSIT NATIONALLY. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT NEARLY RECYCLING COMES FROM JUST THE TEN STATES THAT HAVE A BEVERAGE CONTAINER DEPOSIT LAW. SO LET'S LOOK AT THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE THREE. SO I SAID THAT I WOULD. LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COVERTRELATED ISSUES AND NON COVERT RELATED. WE HAVE A FATALLY FLAWED PAYMENT FORMULA FOR REDEMPTION CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. LEADING TO OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME- MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY'VE BEEN UNDERPAID. AS A RESULT HALF OF THE REDEMPTION CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IT'S ALSO RELATED TO DRAMATICALLY DECLINING MARKET PRICES. LET'S LOOK AT THE NEXT SLIDE. AGAIN THESE ARE PROBLEMS THAT PRE THAT EXISTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STARTED SO THIS SLIDE SHOWS HOW WE'VE LOST ALL OF THESE REDEMPTION CENTERS. AND THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE CROWDING INTO FEWER REDEMPTION CENTERS. IT ALSO THIS SITE DOESN'T SHOW IT BUT MORE OF THE REDEMPTION CENTERS HAVE BEEN LOST IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO LET'S SEE THE NEXT SLIDE AND SEE WHAT THAT WITH THAT HAS A COST. THE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS RETURNED IN THESE- AND SELECTED SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. ACT COMMUNITIES THESE COUNTIES. IS NOW AT A PER CAPITA RATE OF FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY. IN THIS IN THE SECOND ROW OF DATA IN THE CHART THE SELECTED NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES THOSE THAT HAVE RECEIVED AND HAVE SEEN THE MOST REDEMPTION CENTERS CLOSE. THEY'RE ONLY ABLE TO COLLECT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE. CONTAINERS PER CAPITA EVEN THOUGH OUR CONSUMPTION IS. UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THE CURBSIDE PROGRAMS OF PICKED UP A LITTLE BIT OF THAT SLACK BUT THEY REALLY ONLY PICKED UP ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE CONTAINERS THAT WAS LOST THE REST OF BEEN LOST TO THE LANDFILL. SO THESE ARE THE PRE COBIT IMPACTS THE NEXT SLIDE ALSO IS PRE CODED. I'M THE SCRAP VALUES HAVE BEEN TRENDING DOWN SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE DOT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. P. ET PLASTIC AND ALUMINUM CANS ESPECIALLY THAT'S WHERE MORE MOST OF THE REVENUE COMES FROM. IT WAS SEEING DOWNWARD TREND IN PRICING FOR MANY YEARS AND THEN THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE CRASH WHEN THE CORONAVIRUS HAPPENED. ALL OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS ARE AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT THINGS. ALUMINUM CANS VERSUS PT PLASTIC THEY ALL- TRAVEL DOWN THEIR OWN PATH THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN THINGS THAT THEY COMPETE WITH THEIR ALL SUBJECT TO WORLDWIDE TRENDS AS WELL AS- AT LOCAL AND NATIONAL TRENDS. I AM SO IN THE WORLDWIDE MARKET ENERGY PRICES DO YOU IMPACT COMMODITY PRICES WE ALSO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH ALUMINUM CANS WHERE CANNED SHEET MANUFACTURING- WAS CLOSED DOWN IN THE UNITED STATES AND- THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND SHIFTED TO SAUDI ARABIA SO THAT'S ALL IMPACTING THIS AS WELL- BUT THESE MATERIAL PRICES HAVE. HAVE IMPACTED REDEMPTION CENTERS TREMENDOUSLY IN OF LED TO THE CLOSURE OF REDEMPTION CENTERS AS WE TALKED ABOUT. SO ON THE NEXT SLIDE. AM I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT THE TAX CUTS THE COMMODITIES THAT WE GENERATE THROUGH RECYCLING OF OUR BOTTLES AND CANS THE GLASS OF THE PT PLASTIC THE ALUMINUM. IS IN TREMENDOUS DEMANDS AND IS TREMENDOUSLY NEEDED BY THE MANUFACTURERS OF THOSE CONTAINERS BECAUSE THEY ALL USE SOME AMOUNT OF RECYCLED CONTENT. THEY MUST HAVE THE CONTENT IN ORDER TO MAKE NEW BOTTLES AND CANS AGAIN AND ALL OF THE MAJOR TRADE ASSOCIATIONS SPOKE UP THIS YEAR AFTER THE DISRUPTION THAT OCCURRED BECAUSE OF THE CORONA VIRUS AND THEY SAID WE ARE VERY MUCH DEPENDENT ON THESE DEPOSIT PROGRAMS THAT EXIST AROUND THE UNITED STATES. AND WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS. SO NARAL THE ON THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE EIGHT WE'LL LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS. THE SOLID LINE IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WE'LL CONSIDER THAT THE BASELINE OF PACKAGED BEVERAGE SALES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THE DOTTED LINE IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST SEVEN MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S IN A RADIC AND JUMP AND THEN DECLINE WHAT HAPPENS THERE IS THAT BEVERAGE SALES PEAKED DRAMATICALLY IN MARCH THAT'S THAT HUGE SPIKE THAT YOU SEE IN MARCH WITH THE DOTTED LINE. THAT'S WHEN EVERYBODY WENT TO THE STORE AND STOCKED UP ON BOTTLED WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES AND AS THE PANDEMIC BEGAN THEN YOU SEE A HUGE- SHIFT DOWNWARD IN APRIL. AS EVERYONE WAS- STAYING AT HOME WITH ALL THAT MATERIALS ARE ALL HAS BEVERAGES THAT THEY HAD PURCHASED IN MARCH. THEN YOU SEE IN MAY THAT THE DOTTED LINE RISES ABOVE THE SOLID LINE MEANING TWENTY TWENTY SALES ARE HIGHER. DAN TWENTY NINETEEN SALES AND WE'RE SEEING THAT AROUND THE NATION SO BASICALLY THIS SHIFT TO ADD HOME SHIFTED AWAY FROM- FOUNTAIN DRINKS AND CAKE DRINKS. MEANS THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE BUYING PACKAGE BEVERAGES AND THAT'S A SEMI PERMANENT CHANGE AS LONG AS WE'RE ALL STAYING AT HOME AND OUT OF RESTAURANTS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER BEVERAGE SALES INTO THE FUTURE AND SO FAR WE THINK IT'S ABOUT SLIDE. IS ACTUALLY THE LAST SLIDE THIS LOOKS AT- CALIFORNIA C. R. V. RETURNS. SO WHAT WE SAW HAPPENING HERE HI I SHARED THE STORY OF HOW THE REDEMPTION CENTERS HAVE CLOSED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HAS LED. OVERALL TO LAST REDEMPTION. LOWER NUMBER OF UNITS REDEEMED LOWER NUMBER OF UNITS RECYCLED. THAT'S A PERMANENT CHANGE BUT YOU CAN ALSO SEE ON THE SLIDE THE TEMPORARY CHANGE THAT HAPPENED AGAIN IN MARCH AND APRIL FRONT PREDOMINANTLY WHEN THINGS CLOSED DOWN AND THE BLUE DOTTED LINE SHOWS HOW DRAMATICALLY THE CONTAINER RETURNS DROP TYPE DURING THAT JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU SEASON IN MARCH AND APRIL AND THEN THEY CAME BACK UP IN MAY MANJINDER HIGHER. BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DOTTED LINE IS STILL BELOW THE SOLID LINES WERE STILL SEEING LAST AS A PURPOSE PERMANENT OR SEMI PERMANENT CHANGE COMPARED TO BEFORE. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE LAST OF MY REMARKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THANK YOU PERFECT I WILL COME BACK TO A FEW QUESTIONS FROM YOU I WAS REALLY INTRIGUED ABOUT THE ALUMINUM ISSUE- BUT WE HAVE TO MORE- SPEAKERS FOR THIS PANEL. REMINDER SPEAKERS WERE ASKING YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO. SIX MINUTES SIX MINUTES SO NEXT WE HAVE VERONICA PART OF WITH THE REGULATORY AFFAIRS. FOR THE RESOURCE RECOVERY COALITION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT HI. PARDO NICE SERVICE THE REGULATORY AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE RESOURCE RECOVERY COALITION OF CALIFORNIA I'M THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNIST BE TO YOU ALL ON THE IMPACTS OF CODE IN NINETEEN ON THE WASTE AND RECYCLING INDUSTRY AND WHAT'S NEXT FOR CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS WASTE DIVERSION GOALS. AND I ALSO REALLY LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK OUR CENTRAL WORKERS- DURING THIS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING TIME. THE RESOURCE RECOVERY COALITION OF CALIFORNIA IS COMPRISED OF PREDOMINANTLY SMALL TO MID SIZED INDEPENDENT SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING COMPANIES. MANY WHO HAVE WORKED ALONGSIDE THEIR JURISDICTIONS FOR DECADES. I TO MEET OUR STATE MANDATED RECYCLING AND DIVERSION EXPECTATIONS. LIKE MANY INDUSTRIES- HARMON BIRDS WERE IMMEDIATELY IMPACTED BY COPE IN NINETEEN. BUT AS ESSENTIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS IT WAS CRITICAL- THAT THEY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR COMMUNITIES- HAD THE START OF THE PANDEMIC THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS AND NONESSENTIAL BUSINESS CLOSURES. CAUSED AN IMMEDIATE- INJECTOR MATIC CHANGE IN- SERVICES AND MATERIAL VOLUMES NAMELY WE SAW A DECREASE IN TONNAGE AND SERVICES IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR OBVIOUSLY WITH RESTAURANT CLOSURES AND BUSINESS CLOSURES A LOT LESS MATERIAL WAS COMING FROM. THOSE BUSINESS. EXCUSE ME THOSE BUSINESSES- BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE WE SAW AN INCREASE IN TONNAGE IN SERVICES IN THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN THIS WORD STAYING AT HOME AND FOLKS ARE CLEANING OUT THE GARAGES AND YOU KNOW JUST FOLKS ARE CONSUMING AT HOME AS AS BEEN DESCRIBED AND SO YOU'RE SEEING MORE MATERIAL ACTUALLY FLOW THROUGH THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR. NOW AS- SO DESCRIBED MANAGING WASTE MATERIAL IS OF COURSE A LOCAL ISSUE- BUT OUR ASSOCIATION RELEASED A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT TO ASSIST OUR MEMBERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO OFFER POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO ADJUST SERVICES- BASED ON NEED AND IMPACT FOR KOBE NINETEEN SO YOU KNOW JUST SOME EXAMPLES. WE DID HAVE TO SLOW SOME WINDS DOWN FOR PROCESSING AND SOCIALLY JUSTIN'S WORKERS SO. YOU KNOW PROCESSING TIMES HAD TO BE SLOWED DOWN- AND JUST THESE IMPACTS JUST OF COURSE IMPACTED PROCESSING MORE GENERALLY. BUT NOW AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND INTO. HOPEFULLY A RECOVERY PERIOD- WE'RE FOCUSED ON HOW TO SUPPORT CITIES AND RATEPAYERS IN ADDITION TO SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED POLICIES PROGRAMS AND REAL REGULATIONS THAT ENCOURAGE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AS KEY TO STIMULATING THE LOCAL COMIC ECONOMY AND CREATING GREEN JOBS- THAT IS WHY WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING THE S. B. THIRTEEN H. THREE REGULATIONS WHICH WILL REQUIRE RECYCLING OF ORGANIC MATERIAL STATEWIDE BEGINNING JANUARY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD MORE IN STATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROGRAMS TO MANAGE OUR ORGANIC MATERIAL. I'M A WE ARE VERY EXCITED- ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY. WE ARE ALSO HYPER AWARE OF THE ISSUES WE FACE IN MEETING THIS IMPORTANT METHANE REDUCTION GOAL AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS UNFUNDED MANDATE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE ORGANICS RECYCLING WILL IMPLEMENTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. DEVELOPMENT WILL COST UPWARDS OF TEN BILLION BY TWENTY THIRTY TO ACHIEVE. AND WITH SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THESE EXTENDED FISCAL IMPACTS OF KOBE NINETEEN SOME COMMUNITIES NATIONALLY ARE NOW MORE CONSTRAINED IN THEIR ABILITY TO MEET THIS VERY IMPORTANT GOAL. SO WE SEE A REALLY CRITICAL NEED TO HARMONIZE OUR STATE REGULATORY POLICIES AND FRAMEWORKS TO INCENTIVIZE AND ACCELERATE THE DIP DEVELOPMENT OF SB THIRTEEN THREE PROGRAMS ORGANIC RECYCLING PROGRAMS. ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK TO BUILD THE FACILITIES NECESSARY TO MANAGE THIS MATERIAL. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA LACKS THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO MANAGE THE VOLUME OF ORGANIC WASTE WE GENERATE. THE TWO PRIMARY MECHANISMS BY WHICH WE PLAN TO MANAGE THIS MATERIAL IS COMPOSTING AND ANAEROBIC DIGESTION. WHICH EACH PROVIDE THEIR OWN OPPORTUNITIES AND LIMITATIONS AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR WHITE PAPER WHICH GOES INTO MORE DETAIL. BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY BARRIERS TO BUILDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH SERVES AS THE ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT TO PUTTING THIS MATERIAL INTO THE SANITARY LANDFILL. AND WITH THESE INCREASE BARRIERS OF COURSE COME INCREASED COSTS. SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO HOW CAN WE HARMONIZE EFFORTS TO RAPIDLY INCENTIVIZE AND ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S GOAL OF DIVERTING ORGANIC WASTE TO BENEFICIAL USE. WE SUPPORT A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO EFFICIENTLY DIVERT ORGANIC WASTE FROM THE LANDFILL. THAT ADDRESSES THE COSTS AND REGIONAL REGIONAL REGULATORY LIMITATIONS ORGANICS MANAGEMENT INCLUDING A STRATEGY FOR RENEWABLE BIOGAS AND COMPOST USE. WITH CROSS AGENCY AGREEMENT ON THE IMMEDIATE MID TERM AND LONG TERM APPROACH TO MITIGATING AND MANAGING THIS ORGANIC WASTE. THE STRATEGY SHOULD INCLUDE GOALS FOR LOCAL ORGANIC WASTE MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT THE SUPPORT A CIRCULAR ECONOMY FRAMEWORK BOLSTERING LOCAL RESILIENCE AND PUTTING ORGANIC WAYS TO BENEFICIAL USE WITHIN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. WE HAVE TO LINE OR AGENCY GOALS. FOR EXAMPLE WHILE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE MOVE TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WE ALSO NEED REGULATORY CERTAINTY THE RENEWABLE BIOGAS PRODUCED FROM ANAEROBIC DIGESTION. CURRENTLY PROVIDING THE MOST CARBON REDUCTIONS WHEN USED AS RENEWABLE TRANSPORTATION FUEL HAS A HOME IN CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE AND THE DEVELOPMENT IS ADVANCED. NOT ABANDONED AS WE TACKLE CALIFORNIA'S AIR QUALITY GOALS. AND ISSUES SO ULTIMATELY- OUR COMMUNITIES NEED SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR. ORGANIC RECYCLING IMPLEMENTATION WHICH COULD BE ADDRESSED A NUMBER OF WAYS- HISTORICALLY CAL RECYCLE HAS ON OFFER SEED GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GRANT FUND MONEY- GRANT MONEY. TO SUPPORT PROJECTS BUT LONG TERM FUNDING POSSIBLY FROM A COMBINATION OF SOURCES SUCH AS AN INCREASED- LANDFILL TIP FEES A BROADER FACILITY FEE OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM. COULD HELP DIRECT FUNDS TO ACCELERATE AND SUSTAIN ORGANIC WASTE DIVERSION PROGRAMS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND MY COLLEAGUES LOWER FRONT IS ON THE PHONE AS WELL TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU ARE OUR LAST- SPEAKER FOR THIS PANEL WILL BE RICHARD THAT VICE. PRESIDENT CEO. TRY CD COMMUNITY RECYCLING. THE TECHNICIAN CARE- THIS IS RICHARD BY A OF A PRESIDENT TO. TRY TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION BASED IN UNION CITY CALIFORNIA. WE ARE CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST NONPROFIT RECYCLING OPERATION WE HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR FORTY YEARS INCORPORATED IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY. AND THAT WE ARE A NET ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION THAT OWNS FIVE ACRES IN UNION CITY WHICH IS BANNED ARCADING GREATS WITH REGARD TO STAYING IN THE BUSINESS OF RECYCLING- WE EMPLOYED SEVEN. FULL TIME EMPLOYEES. I'M SURE UNION LOCAL SEVEN OUT OF OKAY CAL. AND THE IMPACT OF COLD IT ON OUR BUSINESS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT WITHIN A CENTRAL WORKERS SINCE DAY ONE. WE ALSO RUN A FULL SERVICE RECYCLING BUY BACK CENTRE. BY LOCAL YOU THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED AND DOOR PEOPLE OF THAT HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. TWENTY FIVE OR EMPLOYEES ARE LOCAL YOU. AND THEY RANGE IN AGE FROM SIXTEEN TO TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD- WE RECYCLE ABOUT A HUNDRED TONS OF MATERIAL PER DAY- OUR RECYCLING PROGRAM AND WE SEVEN CITIES OF HAYWARD. AND UNION CITY OUR OUR VIDAK: CENTER WILL HOLD ITS FIRST YEAH IT. WOOD IMPACTED WE WERE ONLY GETTING ABOUT. FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE CUSTOMERS PER DAY. ONCE THE INITIAL FEAR OF HOLE THAT LIFTED A LITTLE BIT IN OUR AREA THIS WAS LATE MARCH. EARLY APRIL WE STARTED TO SEE AN INCREASE THEREBY BACK RECYCLING SYSTEM- BASE WE ARE NOW AVERAGING THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE CUSTOMERS PER DAY. IN A RECYCLING CENTER WE RECYCLE PER DAY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND P. E. T. BOTTLES OR ABOUT TEN TONS OF PLASTIC P. E. T. BOTTLES ABOUT TWO AND A HALF TIMES OF ALUMINUM CANS PER DAY AND ABOUT FIVE TONS OF BLACKOUTS THESE ARE ALL OF THE R. V. CALIFORNIA RETENTION MATERIAL. THEY COME TO OUR CENTER THE WAITING LINE IS ABOUT AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES. AND EXTENDS FOR SEVERAL BLOCKS- WE HAVE WE SERVICE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS- ARE BATES BECAUSE ALL OF THE REDEMPTION CENTERS IN THE GREATER BAY AREA HAVE PRETTY MUCH THAT SHUT DOWN AND THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN OF US LEFT. SERVING A SIGNIFICANT A POPULATION. SHOW THAT A HUGE IMPACT IN THIS IS BECAUSE THE REDEMPTION CENTER THAT YOU KNOW. THROUGHOUT THE STATE MANY OF THEM CRITICALLY IN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE GONE BELLY UP. AT THE ONLY REASON THAT WE DIDN'T GO BELLY UP IS BECAUSE WE OWN FIVE ACRES. AND WE'RE ABLE TO KEEP OUR HEAD ABOVE WATER. WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON COATED WITH REGARD TO OUR RESIDENTIAL RECYCLING- WE ARE EXPERIENCING ABOUT 35240% CONTAMINATION. AND THE RESIDENTIAL RECYCLING PROGRAM WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF FACE MASK COMING ACROSS OUR STORYLINE. WHICH WIND UP AT THE END OF YOUR LINE WE NEVER TOUCH THAT MATERIAL. ON THE INITIAL STAGES BETWEEN MARCH IN LATE APRIL. OUR INDUSTRY WAS NOT TOUCHING ANYTHING ON THE SHORELINE ARE DRIVERS WERE NOT EXITING THEIR TRUCKS. BECAUSE WE WERE ALL BEING TOLD THAT POTENTIAL THE CALL DID WAS TRAVELING ON PLASTICS AND CARDBOARD AND PAPER. SO WE ARE WE WERE NOT TOUCHING THAT MATERIAL AT ALL AGAIN ONCE THE DEER WAS LIFTED WE ARE NOW SORTING MATERIAL AND- PEOPLE FEEL SAFER. A SOCIAL DISAGREEMENT THE BIG PART OF OUR BUSINESS R. THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE CUSTOMERS TO COME TO THE BUY BACK. WE HAD TO BUY A LOT OF- E. P. FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS MANY OF THEM ARE HOMELESS MANY OF THEM COMING ON BICYCLES- PUSHING SHOPPING CARTS AND THEY DON'T HAVE THAT. WE HAD ONE THAT. IN THAT AS WELL AS HAND WASHING. WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO. UPLOAD A PARTY ON THE PROPERTY ONE OF FOUR OF THE TABLE PEOPLE AND THEY'RE HEAVILY USED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING TO WAIT IN LINE FOR SO LONG. OUR DRIVERS- HAVE PROTOCOLS WITH REGARD TO HOW THE INTERFACE WITH THE CUSTOMERS. AND HOW THEY OF TALK WITH CUSTOMERS EVERYBODY'S WORK VERY BASS BASS. AND DRIVERS ALSO CARRY EXTRA FACEMASK IN CASE RESIDENTS COME OUT THEY WANT TO SPEAK TO THEM AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE FACE MASK- WE RUN ABOUT IT WELL WE RUN FIFTEEN SEVEN TRUCKS SEVENTEEN TRUCKS PER DAY. OUT OF OUR OPERATIONS AND- I THINK THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IN CLOSING IS THAT I SAW IN THE- REPERTORY MATERIALS. HE HE- AT THIRTY NINE CENTS A POUND IF WE COULD GET THIRTY NINE CENTS A POUND WE COULD PROBABLY SURVIVE AND CONTINUE DOING THE RECYCLING OPERATION THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS US. GOING IN THERE VIDAK: MENTOR IS BE HANDLING FEES THAT ARE PAID FOR US THROUGH EVERY CONTAINER THAT WE HAVE TO COME TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE CURRENT CRISIS SPURS PLASTIC SODA BOTTLES IT IS SIX SEVEN A POUND IT GONNA BLOW A. FOUR CENT A POUND. THE CURRENT PRICE FOR CAN THAT WE GET IS AROUND FIFTY CENTS POUND. THE CARD PRICE FOR MAKES PAY WHICH IS THE SIGNIFICANT OUR OF OUR RESIDENTIAL MIXES TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A TONNE. AND THE CURRENT PRICE FOR CARDBOARD IS NINETY FIVE DOLLARS A TONNE. ALL OF THAT MATERIAL PRETTY MUCH IS SHIPPED OFF SHORE. WE IMPORTED COMMITTEE TO OPPRESS THE STATE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO PRESS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE NEW YORK NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT TO SIGN ON TO THE BATTLE CONVENTION THERE IS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT COUNTRIES THAT ARE PART OF THAT CONVENTION. WE NEED TO BE A PART OF THAT OTHERWISE POTENTIALLY ARE MIXED PLASTICS WILL HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. AND IT WILL BE REJECTED BY THE SIGNATORIES OF THE BASIL CONVENTION- THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU A LOT OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT HERE- WHO WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN QUESTIONING. I'LL START WITH- A START WITH WHAT WILL GO TO THE TOP SO WE'LL GET SUSAN ON THE- SUSAN COLLINS ON THE SCREEN THAT WE CAN. ASK YOU QUESTIONS WE CAN GO DOWN. SO CAN WE GET. HOW CAN WE JUST ARE STOCKING YEAH I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT- THE STATISTICS YOU TALKED ABOUT ALUMINUM I FOUND THAT VERY. VACILLATING AND I HAVE KNOWN THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE IN THE BEER MARKET WHICH I I'M I'M A- CONSUMER AND THEN NOT ASHAMED OF THAT. I KNOW THAT FOR YEARS A WOMAN IT WAS FROWNED UPON AND IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE CLASS BUT EVEN BEFORE- THAT WE SAW A SHIP FILLED SPENT BY THE CRAP. BREWERIES ARE GOING TO ALUMINUM- FOR FRANKLY WAS IT WAS CHEAPER- THERE CONSUMERS DIDN'T MIND IT AND SO IT WAS KIND OF A WIN WIN. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IF WE KNOW THAT THAT THERE'S SOME- ITEMS WHICH ARE ARE. HAVE MORE WORK IN THIS KIND OF TALK ABOUT LAST SPEAKER AS WELL MR BY A- SOME PRODUCTS HAVE MORE OF A VALUE. IN IN THE RECYCLING MARKET SHOULD SHOULD CALIFORNIA BE DOING ANYTHING TO PUT OUR THUMB ON THE SCALE TO. AND YOU KNOW INCENTIVIZE FOR EXAMPLE OBVIOUSLY BEER IS NOT. PRODUCED IN PLASTIC BOTTLES. BUT OTHER PRODUCTS ARE SO SHOULD WE BE THINKING ABOUT- INCENTIVIZING AN- YOU KNOW. SETTING POLICY TO PUSH A CERTAIN DIRECTION WHICH WE KNOW. PRODUCTS HAVE HAVE MORE UPSIDE OF BEING RECYCLED. WELL AS GREAT QUESTION AND- I'LL ADDRESS THE ALUMINUM SITUATION A LITTLE BIT FIRST TO ADD A LITTLE MORE TO THE CONTEXT YOU WERE GIVING. AND AS YOU SAID BOTTLES USED TO BE PREFERRED ESPECIALLY BY CRAFT BREWERS. AND- TWO THINGS HAVE HAPPENED ONE THERE'S JUST BEEN A GRADUAL ACCEPTANCE OF A HAT ALUMINUM CANS BY THE CRAFT BEVERAGE CONSUMER. BUT THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT DAY HE HAD TO SCRAMBLE SO MUCH TO CREATE A WAY TO AND GET THEIR MARKET OUT INTO THE MARKET PLACE. AND WITH THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC AND- DAY STARTED USING CANS BECAUSE THAT FEELING LINES ARE ESIER FOR THEM TO INSTALL ON THE FACILITIES SO IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S A GREATER USE OF ALUMINUM BECAUSE THAT HARD SELTERS HAVE BECOME SO POPULAR LIKE WHITE CLAW AND THOSE ARE SOLD. IN ALUMINUM CANS SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE SEEING AS A PERMANENT OR SEMI PERMANENT CHANGE- BUT IN TERMS OF INCENTIVIZING- IT CREATING INCENTIVES OR CREATING PENALTIES THERE THERE. YOU KNOW THE TWO SIDES OF THE COIN- ABSOLUTELY WE CAN DO THAT AND THAT IS DONE YEAH- WORLDWIDE. THE TERM OF ART IS ECO MODULATION FEES WE HAVE CERTAIN FEES ALREADY THAT EXISTS IN THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALL OF THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE TO PAY FEES INTO THE SYSTEM AND THAT HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE MATERIALS TO RECYCLE HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN THE ONES THAT ARE IN THE MATERIALS THAT ARE WORTH MORE OR EASIER TO RECYCLE. M. BUT WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH THERE- THERE'S BEEN SOME REALLY RICH CONVERSATIONS IN A STATE WIDE RECYCLING COMMISSION ABOUT THE NUANCES EVEN WITHIN P. ET PLASTIC THERE'S GREEN PLASTIC VERSUS CLEAR PLASTIC AND THOSE ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLDS- SO. WE CAN WE CAN IDENTIFY WHERE THERE ARE BARRIERS TO RECYCLING AND WE CAN SET THE PENALTIES AND SAYS HONEST TO GET THE RESULTS WE- OKAY. YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE SPEAKER. MISTER CHANG. I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR CHART YOU HAVE THAT- DIAGRAM SHOWING THE LOS BETWEEN PTA GLASS AND THERE WAS QUITE A BIG DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN PAINTING GLASS COULD YOU- JUST WALK US THROUGH WHAT THE DIFFERENCE. YOU MIGHT BE I'M NOT SURE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT SIDES THAT COULD BE IT COULD BE THAT I'M THE- SLIDE NUMBER THREE THE CUMULATIVE SHORTFALLS TO THE REDEMPTION CENTERS. AND WHERE THERE IS THERE ARE TWO LINES AND ONE OF THEM WAS LABELED PT AND THE OTHER ONE GLASS DOT ONE YEAH AND- IF THAT'S THE CASE THAT PARTICULAR CHART WAS ON THE UNDERPAYMENTS TO THE REDEMPTION CENTERS. AND MOST OF THE UNDER PAYMENTS ARE A RESULT OF THE GAP BETWEEN PT PRICES AND EXPECTED PT PRICES- GLASSES A MUCH SMALLER PLAYER AND THAT SO THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT CHART I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE CORRECT CHARTED A DOT THAT IS RETURNS TO BE SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS. THAT IS IT BECAUSE- GLASS IS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF SO WE STREAM RELATIVE TO PT. OR IS IT THAT. CLASS PRICES. HAVE HELD UP RELATIVE TO. THEIR THEIR THEIR RECYCLING VALUE AND THEN INTO THE PT'S PRICING HASN'T REALLY. HELD UP WE HEARD SUPERVISOR- VALERIE KIND OF TALK ABOUT IF THE PT PRICES ACTUALLY WHAT. WAS NOTED IN IN IN THE REPORT THAT THEY IN FACT WOULD BE WOULD BE FINE. THE ANSWER IS BOTH YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON BOTH FRONTS- GLASS IS A SMALLER PORTION THE NUMBER OF UNITS YOU KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF UNITS THAT ARE GLASSES IS WELL UNDER THIRD. PT IS THE DOMINANT CATEGORY IN THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAM MORE THAN 50% OF THE UNITS SOLD OR PT SO THAT FIRST THING IS RIGHT THERE'S MORE PT IN THE SYSTEM BUT THEN THE P. ET PRICES ARE SO MUCH HIGHER LIKE LAST CELLS FOR. IN THE RANGE OF ZERO DOLLARS A TEN TO TWENTY DOLLARS A TONNE WORRIES PT IS IN THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS PER TON. AND TO THE DECLINES IN PT HAVE BEEN MORE- MUCH MUCH GREATER PERCENTAGE DECLINES IN THE PT PRICES SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS THREE THINGS MULTIPLIED TOGETHER MEANS THAT PT HAS THIS REALLY DOMINANT A FACT AND UNDERPAYMENTS RELATED TO PT IS REALLY THE DOMINANT EFFECT ON- THE REDEMPTION CENTERS. GREAT THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- YES. YEAH WE ONE SECOND I JUST WANTED TO- I DID MAKE ANNOUNCEMENTS EARLIER AND I'M NOT SURE ALL THE PUBLIC WAS HERE. WE DO HAVE- RULES FOR A CLUB IN NINETEEN AND THIS PANDEMIC OF ONE OF AND ONE OF THEM IS YOU MUST WEAR A MASK AT ALL TIMES AND SO. NOT CERTAIN IF THE INDIVIDUAL- BUT DIDN'T GET THAT MESSAGE OR- WASN'T AWARE THAT BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE- HAVE ROLES HERE AND WE WANT TO OF COURSE- FOLLOW THEM AND LEAD BY EXAMPLE HERE IN OUR STATE CAPITOL- SO WITH THAT WE HAVE ASSEMBLY WOMAN- FRIEDMAN HAS A QUESTION FOR THIS PANELISTS AND THEN. SOME A MEMBER EGGMAN- FROM HER DISTRICT ALSO WANTS TO ENGAGE WITH SUSAN COLLINS THANK YOU. HI THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- I WAS ABLE TO GO TO OREGON AND- OBSERVED THERE. REALLY IMPRESSIVE BOTTLE REDEMPTION PROGRAM WHICH IS YOU KNOW- THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING AND I COULD CERTAINLY SEE. HOW IT WOULD BE VERY- HELPFUL AND CONVENIENT TO CONSUMERS AND I SAY THAT IS SOMEBODY THAT LITERALLY HAS ABOUT EIGHT BOXES BIG BOXES OF GLASS RIGHT NOW SITTING ON MY PATIO EXCEPT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IT. TO REDEMPTION CENTER BECAUSE I KNOW IF I PUT MY TRASH IT'LL TURN INTO CONTAMINATION AND I WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST I WANTED TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT SERIOUSLY IN CALIFORNIA OR JOINING THEIR PROGRAM. AND SECONDLY I KNOW THAT THE BOTTLE BILL IS VERY COMPLICATED BUT IF THERE'S ANY SIMPLE FIXES YOU YOU WOULD THAT YOU SAVE YOURSELF GOSH THIS WOULD BE SO EASY WHY DON'T THE JUST DO THIS OR THAT. IF YOU HAD ANY. THOUGHTS ABOUT YOU KNOW. EASY FOR THINGS WE COULD DO TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER THAT'S MY FRIEND THAT I HAVE A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS. GREAT SO A GREAT QUESTION ABOUT OR AGAIN- I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE PROGRAM IN OREGON. IT IT OFFERS SO MANY CONVENIENCES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH THE VARIOUS WAYS THAT YOU CAN RETURN CONTAINERS TO THE- TO THE STORES OR THROUGH THEIR BACKDROP PROGRAM. OR THROUGH THE REDEMPTION CENTERS THAT THEY'VE BUILT THEY'VE- DONE THE RIGHT THING WITH INCREASING THE DEPOSIT VALUE FROM FIVE CENTS TO TEN CENTS. AND WHEN THEY DID THAT THEIR REDEMPTION RATE INCREASED FROM 64% 286% TO THE SITE 22% INCREASE IN THE RETENTION RATE. AND THAT'S IT THAT'S A WORLD CLASS CONCEPT THAT THEY'VE IMPLEMENTED- DO SO THERE'S SO MANY THINGS ABOUT IT THEY'VE ALSO EXPANDED TO DIFFERENT MATERIAL TIRED. YES DIFFERENT MATERIAL TYPES AND IFFERENT COVERAGE TYPES. AND THEY'RE DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPANDING ALSO TO AND WINE AND SPIRITS ESPECIALLY SINCE. I MENTIONED THOSE HARD SELTZER CONTAINERS DOES SEEM TO BE COMING THROUGH OUR SYSTEMS ANYWAY- SO. OREGON IS GREAT AND THERE'S A LOT TO LEARN FROM IT IT'S AND IT'S ONE OF AT LEAST THE TOP TWO PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES IF NOT THE BEST ONE RIGHT NOW. ON ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LEVELS. AND I THINK I'VE GOT MYSELF OFF TRACK- I KNOW THAT THE SECOND QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED WAS ABOUT AN EASY FIXES. HI I'M AFRAID NOT AND IF THERE WERE EASY FIXES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE CONTAINER DEPOSIT LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEY PROBABLY ALREADY WOULD HAVE AND SORRY TO BE YOU KNOW TO GIVE A DISAPPOINTING ANSWER. AND IT THE PROGRAM IT NEEDS WHOLESALE CHANGES AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE WRONG WITH THE PROGRAM THAT ARE REALLY REALLY LARGE ISSUES THAT REALLY NEED TO BE TACKLED THAT'S GREAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY HOPEFUL RESPONSE AND IT IT WILL HELP TO GUIDE. I THINK THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AND HOW WE LOOK AT VARIOUS OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION. I'M SO. THIS AGREES QUESTIONS I'M GONNA ASK FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO ANSWER SO. IF YOU THINK THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT QUESTION IF YOU JUST PASS AND MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE. ON THE PANEL WANT TO ANSWER IT. SO WE DEFINITELY HAVE ISSUES WITH CONTAMINATION IN THE WASTE STREAM- AND- I'M WONDERING. WHAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT TO REDUCE AT THAT LEVEL OF CONTAMINATION- I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IT IT IS THAT IS THE- PROBLEM REALLY. AT THE BEEN LEVEL SHOULD WE BE GIVING PEOPLE FOR BINS TO SORT THEIR TRASH. OR SHOULD WE BE TRYING TO FOCUS MORE ON REDUCING THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIAL THAT ARE IN THE RE STREAM. IF YOU HAD YOUR DRUTHERS OR IS IT BOTH- WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING ABOUT CONTAMINATION. HOW DID YOU HEAR THE QUESTION I WOULD BE THERE ARE- I HEARD QUITE THIS IS RICHARD FROM TRY SAID RECYCLING. GREAT I CAN I FEEL THAT QUESTION YES GO AHEAD- THANK YOU THERE ARE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND SCHOOL CHILDREN K. THROUGH TWELVE. OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD IS THOSE ARE AMBASSADORS OF HOW TO SAVE THE PLANET. IT WEEK DEAR SOMETHING TOWARD OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND CAN SOMEHOW GET INTO THE CLASSROOM THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. THE CHILDREN ARE THE ONES THAT TEACH THE PARENTS HOW TO RECYCLE THAT'S HOW WE STARTED THE PROGRAM. IN THE TRI CITIES FREMONT NEWARK UNION CITY AND HAYWARD. INITIALLY MORE PICKED UP RECYCLING BACK IN THE EIGHTY THAT WAS THE MOST. INVASIVE WAY TO GET INTO THE HOUSEHOLD- THE CHILDREN AND I THINK WE'VE LOST THAT CONTINUITY BECAUSE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SO INUNDATED WITH WORK OUR TEACHERS ARE ALSO OVERWHELMED. WITH DEMANDS ON TESTING BUT THAT IS THE BEST METHODOLOGY THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED LET ME SAY ONE MORE THING ON THE DEPOSIT. FROM A NICKEL TO A DIME. I AGREE WITH CALL. BUT HERE A VERY- AT THE I. WE ARE PAYING OUT ON AVERAGE- PR WEEK FIVE DAYS A WEEK BASED ON CURRENT MARKET PRICES. IN CASH TO OUR CUSTOMER FLOW BECAUSE WE'RE SO INUNDATED WITH CUSTOMERS. IN EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER WEEK IN CASH. AND THAT THAT ABOUT FIVE CENTS PER CONTAINER. IF WE DOUBLE THAT TO A DEADLINE OUR CASH FLOW WILL HAVE TO GO TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER WEEK. THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH CAL RECYCLES PAYMENT. WITH THE GUARDS WHO ARE RECEIVING OUR HANDLING FEES AND REIMBURSEMENTS. SO WE HAVE TO VERY CAREFULLY DO THE CALCULATION ABOUT WHO CAN HANDLE THAT KIND OF CASH FLOW THROUGH THE BUSINESS AGAIN STAY IN BUSINESS. WE HAVE TO SOMEHOW PROP UP THE BUSINESSES AND WE'RE ASKING YOU TO RATE THE REDEMPTION VALUE FROM THE NICKEL TO A DIME. HOWEVER WE FULLY SUPPORT. NOT ONLY INCREASE UNIT TO A DYING BUT ALSO INCREASING. IT AND WINE BOTTLES. THANK YOU YOU MENTIONED- CASH FLOW DOES ANYBODY HAVE AN IDEA OF THE AVERAGE. BUT COST TO RATEPAYERS THE AVERAGE REPAIR PER WEEK WHAT THEY'RE PAYING. IN FEES TO MITIGATE PLASTIC POLLUTION ARE BOTTLED RECYCLING AND EVERYTHING ELSE. ANYONE WANT TO GET ALMOST GIVING US. THIS IS VERONICA PARDO THE RESEARCHER CURRY COALITION YOU KNOW I'M I THINK I WOULD DIRECT YOU TO A COUPLE DIFFERENT REPORTS THAT HAVE COME OUT- EVEN FROM CAL RECYCLE THERE'S A RECENT REPORT RIGHT NOW SYSTEM SB THIRTEEN THE THREE IMPLEMENTATION BUT MORE GENERALLY SPEAKING. THE CONVERSATIONS THAT AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING AND YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD IS THAT WE ARE SEEING CONTAMINATION INCREASE AT THE RESIDENTIAL LEVEL BASED ON THE GENERATION OF THIS MATERIAL GOING INTO THE VAN AND YES WE DO NEED TO EDUCATE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE MATERIALS THAT ARE GOING INTO THE BLUE BAND AND WE DO HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE WORK HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THE COMMISSION LEVEL. LARA FOR ON TODAY- I BELIEVE IS ON THE LINE AND IS SERVING AS A COMMISSIONER WHAT IT AND SO IS RICHARD BY ANY- ON THIS ON THIS VERY WORKS ALERT IF YOU COULD. PLEASE JUMP IN. YEAH YEAH UNFORTUNATELY THIS WAR FRONT AND FORTUNATELY I DON'T- HAVE ANY INFORMATION FOR YOU AT THE TIME ABOUT WHAT THE- COST IS TO RATE PAYERS. ABOUT IT YOU KNOW TO DEAL WITH PLASTIC POLLUTION- YOU KNOW WE CAN TRY TO. FOLLOW UP WITH OUR MEMBERS AND TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT I DID I'M SORRY NICOLE. I WANT TO BURKE I WANT TO CLARIFY I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PLASTIC POLLUTION. IN TERMS OF PEOPLE BEING OUT. HAVING TO PICK BACKS UP OFF THE STREET. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE WE PAYING. APPROXIMATELY TO DEAL WITH EITHER TRYING TO RECYCLE PLASTIC OR DEAL WITH IN OUR LANDFILL. IS THERE ANY WAY TH. I GUESS IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT THE SOMEHOW THE COST OF THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT AND IT IS A PRODUCT THAT'S BEING SOLD. TO CONSUMERS AND PUT INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT. BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A WAY OF MONETIZING. THE COST THAT RATE PAYERS. AND TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THIS. BECAUSE EVERY TIME. WE IN THE LEGISLATURE. TRY TO PASS A BILL DEALING WITH PLASTIC INCLUDING LAST YEAR'S CIRCULAR ECONOMY BILLS. SB FIFTY FOUR IN AB TEN EIGHTY. WHAT WE HEAR BACK FROM INDUSTRY AND FROM- THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND OTHERS IS ALL ABOUT COST WHAT THIS WOULD COST TO CONSUMERS. AND WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE READILY ANY DATA ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SHOW. THE FINANCIAL COST. OF DEALING WITH THE POLLUTION YES BUT ALSO WITH. JUST DISPOSING OF THE MATERIAL. SO I DON'T EXPECT YOU ALL TO ANSWER BUT I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE START TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE STATE WHETHER THEY HAVE THE ABILITY. TO PAY OR NOT WHETHER THEY'RE PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR NOT. BECAUSE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS COST OF THE COST OF THE CITIES AS WELL. YES I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AND I AND I DON'T HAVE A CONCRETE NUMBER OUT BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN RATES. I KNOW WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT- THE CLOSURE OF MARKETS FOR THREE THREE SEVEN PLASTICS RIGHT THESE. THESE LOW GRADE CLASS THAT THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE- MUCH RECYCLING VALUE. WE KNOW THAT WHEN THOSE MARKETS CLOSED OFF RATE INCREASED FOR CONSUMERS AND GENERATORS RECYCLING- COSTS THAT SHOULD SAY INCREASE. AROUND THE STATE AS A RESULT OF THAT SO I THINK. YOU KNOW THE ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FARTHER UPSTREAM RIGHT WE DON'T THERE IS NO MARKET THE THREE THREE SEVEN CLASSICS WHY IS THAT- MAYBE WE SHOULD FOCUS ON MOVING AWAY FROM THOSE CLASSICS AND THAT IS IN PART OF MONICA MENTIONED. WHAT THE CONNECTION THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN SET UP TO THE BILL LAST YEAR IS DEALING- AND THAT'S FROM THE COMMISSION. IN THE RICHER BY A IS ON THAT COMMISSION WITH WHILE ALSO TRYING TO IDENTIFY. WHAT THE MATERIAL WHAT PRODUCT ARE TRULY RECYCLABLE WHAT'S WHAT ARE ACTUALLY BEING RECYCLED IN CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE A LOT OF THAT IS DEPENDENT ON- WHAT THE MARKETS ARE. FOR THAT AND WHETHER THEY CAN BE REUSED AND CAN BE RECYCLED INTO NEW PRODUCT. AND THEN TRYING TO SHIFT AWAY FROM THOSE PRODUCTS THAT DON'T. HAVE- TELL YOU. I KNOW THAT YEAH KNOW THAT'S- AND ACTUALLY- SAY THAT THERE IS A CORAL. WITH THE WITH THE MATERIALS AND COSTS FOR CONSUMERS IS. A REALLY INTERESTING HERE AND SOMETHING THAT I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT AT SOME POINT. AND I WILL GO BACK YOU YOU REFERRED TO MS ADMINS COMMENTS US SENATOR EGGMAN SOON TO BE SENATOR EGGMAN COMMENTS. AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH HER THIS IS NOT ABOUT BLAMING- INDIVIDUALS- REPAIRS CONSUMERS IN FACT. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE SPENT YEARS BLAMING THEM FOR PLASTIC POLLUTION FOR. LACK OF RECYCLING FOR CONTAMINATION NOW AND NONE OF THAT'S THEIR FAULT THEY'RE RECYCLING BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING YOU KNOW THE THAT THEY THROW EVERYTHING IN THE BIN EVEN THAT'S IF IT'S NOT RECYCLABLE SPEECH SHOWS THAT THEY REALLY WANT. TO BE GOOD STEWARDS AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY WANT THESE PRODUCTS TO BE RECYCLED. AND THE TRUTH IS THERE NOT AND THE ONES WHO ARE. PAYING THE BURDEN OF THAT ARE THE EXACT SAME PEOPLE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. ARE PAYING MORE THAN UTILITY BILL. THEY'RE BEING BLAMED FOR PLASTIC POLLUTION. AND I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S AN ACCIDENT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT'S- KIND OF BEEN DONE. OVER THE YEARS SAID TO THEM. AND WE YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE THE ONES TO. TO SORT OF STOP THAT AND RECLAIM THAT AND PUT THE BURDEN FINANCIAL BURDEN AND BLAME BURDEN WHERE IT BELONGS WHICH IS ON THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY IN THESE MANUFACTURERS. NOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT A LOT OF THEM AREN'T REALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE STRAWBERRY PEOPLE A LITTLE LATER AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING INCREDIBLE WORK AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT ARE. TAKING SOURCE PRODUCTION VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE SHOULD. YOU KNOW IT KNOWLEDGE AND CELEBRATE THAT TO ENCOURAGE THEM- AND SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS TO SO. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW KIND OF AS A SOCIETY- WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE WHICH IS WHY. WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING SO THANK YOU MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU. I KNOW THAT IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN. REMOTELY WANT TO ASK A QUESTION NOW AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TO GO BACK TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY- QUESTION. VERY SIMPLE CONCRETE IF YOU'RE WORRIED CRAPPIE ARE CONSUMER OF WHAT IS THE MOST RESPONSIBLE WAY TO CONSUME HERE RIGHT NOW IS A GLASS IS IT IS IT I CAN. OR IS IT A CAKE. JUST TO BE HELPFUL. M. AND MANY CAKE WHICH SAM BREWERIES DO PROVE IT PROVIDE AND I KNOW PEOPLE WHO ALSO MAKE THEIR OWN BEER AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE WAYS TO REDUCE AND THE USE OF DISPOSABLE SINGLE USE. PACKAGING. SO OKAY WRITER WITH THE HYDRO FLASK. YEAH AND YOU KNOW IT IT I'LL JUST GIVE A COUPLE MORE EXAMPLES IN OUR OWN HOME WE DON'T USE THEM BOTTLED WATER AND I HAVEN'T USED BOTTLED WATER FOR TEN YEARS NOW AND I'VE BEEN JUST FINE. AND WE HAVE A SODASTREAM MACHINE SO THAT SPARKLING WATER WE CAN MAKE THAT AT HOME AND WE CAN FLAVORED OURSELVES AND WE CAN BY- OUR MILK IN REFILLABLE BOTTLES FROM STRAUS CREAMERY WE TAKE THOSE BACK TO THE STORE EVERY TIME WE GO SHOPPING SO THERE'S A LOT OF WAYSTO AVOID. AND SINGLE USE PACKAGING. THANK YOU. OKAY HI I HAVE A QUESTION I WANT TO ASK FOR RUNNING THEM PART OF. WE OF COURSE COULD HAVE ANOTHER HEARING TODAY ON ORGANICS WHICH WE HAVE HAD WITH THIS. SELECT COMMITTEE AND WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE AS WELL I JUST IT IT WASN'T REALLY TOUCHED ON TODAY BUT IT YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN THIS ONE IF YOU CAN. EXPAND UPON THAT HOW WE'RE DOING WITH ORGANICS AND MORE AS FAR AND MORE IN THE LAST YEAR WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH OUR ORGANIC. RECYCLING EFFORTS HERE CALIFORNIA AND FOOD WASTE PACIFIC LEE. AND- COBIT. NINETEEN WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY YEAH AND AS I MENTIONED WE DID PRODUCE A WHITE PAPER THAT HAVE-SOME OF THESE DETAILS AND MOST OF IT IS DERIVED FROM THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD CAN RECYCL ANOTHER AGENCY DOCUMENTS SO THERE WAS A RECENT INFRASTRUCTURE REPORT PROVIDED BY CAL RECYCLE IT KIND OF GOES INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT SOME OF THIS DEVELOPMENT BUT WELL YOU ARE SEEING IS THE SLOW DEVELOPMENT ON THE GROUND AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING THE REGULATORY ISSUES- ARE ARE ARE VERY DIFFICULT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NON ATTAINMENT AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE WE HAVE TO MEET VERY STRICT- EMISSION REQUIREMENTS WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING EVEN A COMPOST FACILITY YOU KNOW IT'S VERY EASY FOR US TO THINK OF COMPOST IS THIS WONDERFUL GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND IT REALLY IS BUT WITHOUT INFRASTRUCTURE COMES ITS OWN EMISSIONS AND ISSUES ANY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE NEW SOURCE EMISSION CALIFORNIA YOU'RE GONNA HAVE REGULATORY LIMITATIONS AND ISSUES IN NOT SO REALLY IT'S SLOW RIGHT NOW IT'S SLOW AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE- ASKING AND- ASKING YOU ALL TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS FROM A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE REFUSE INDUSTRY. WE ARE TRYING TO MANAGE THIS MATERIAL THE ORGANIC WAY SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS FOR MORE AT IF THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER WALL VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM IS A MILLION TIMES A YEAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN MILLION TONS OF ORGANIC WASTE THAT IS EMITTING METHANE IN OUR LANDFILLS THIS IS JUST A HUGE ENORMOUS LEFT- THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET OUR CLIMATE RDUCTION GOALS SO I WISH I HAD MORE OF YOU KNOW POSITIVE NEWS THAT. IN BILL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURES GETTING YOU KNOW GETTING OFF THE GROUND BUT IT'S NOT AND OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MEETING THESE OBLIGATIONS JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO MEANING ALL ORGANICS ARE COLLECTED FROM BOTH. RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL GENERATORS. I HOPE THAT WAS HELPFUL. YEAH SO IT IS A BE LIKE WE'RE TALK ABOUT RECYCLING WORSE. AND MY HOUSE AS WELL WE ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION BLUE BAND AND IN OUR HEAD IT'S RECYCLED SO. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO ARE GOING TO HAVE THE ORGANICS BEEN FILLED UP AND THEN NOT HAVE A PROPER PLACE TO. DISPOSE OF IT. EXACTLY IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT MATERIAL GO I MEAN WE USE A SANITARY LANDFILL FOR A REASON RIGHT I MEAN AND I UNDERSTAND LANDFILLS WE DON'T WANT METHANE EMITTING THAT WE HAVE THESE LANDFILLS ARE MANAGEMENT. IT'S HOW WE MANAGE THIS MATERIAL RIGHT AND SO FOR GONNA MOVE IT OUT OF THE LANDFILL- WE NEED TO HAVE A PLACE TO PUT IT AND THAT IS IT EITHER A COMPOST FACILITY OR ANAEROBIC DIGESTION FACILITY IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO MORE FEEDSTOCKS WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. IT GOES TO CHIP AND GRINDIN BIOMASS AND ANIMAL FEED AND ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS BUT THE PRIMARY MECHANISMS ARE COMPOSTING ANAEROBIC DIGESTION. AND COMPOSTING OBVIOUSLY IS MORE YOU KIND OF THINK ABOUT MORE IN THE AGRICULTURAL AREAS RIGHT- OPEN WIND ROSE AS YOU START TO GET URBAN ENVIRONMENTS AGAIN WITH THE EMISSION ISSUES YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO MORE- ENCLOSED INFRASTRUCTURE. THE ADVANTAGE MOST ADVANCED BEST IN CLASS TECHNOLOGY WHICH REALLY DOES COST MORE THIS IS NOT JUST YOU KNOW PUTTING SOME ORGANIC MATERIAL IN IN A WHOLE AND HOPING IT ALL GOES WELL THESE ARE REALLY JUST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES TO MANAGE AS MATERIAL PRODUCES REALLY. IMPORTANT COMPOST OR IN THE CASE OF BIOGAS AAEROBIC DIGESTION WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN COMPOST- AND SO WE DO NEED TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS IN THOSE INITIAL CRITICAL INVESTMENTS. THAT ARE GOING TO PLAY OUT OVER THE LONG TERM. OKAY THANK YOU ANY. QUESTIONS FOR THESE. I DID ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT RICHARD BY EIGHT NOT ONLY IS WITH THE- THE TRICE CD TRY SAID COMMUNITY RECYCLING BUT IS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL LIKE LIKE US APPEARANCE COUNTY SUPERVISOR IN ALAMEDA COUNTY SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PUBLIC SERVICE MR BY ANY- WITH THAT WE WILL NOW PROCEED TO THE THIRD PANEL. AS FAR AS IMPACTS ON MARKETS AND WE WILL START WITH PETER KELLER VICE PRESIDENT RECYCLING AND SUSTAINABILITY AT REPUBLIC SERVICES. OKAY MISTER KELLER IS IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY. COME ON UP. CERTAINLY WE SEE REPUBLIC HELLO ALL AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES HERE AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY AS WELL. GREAT- SHARES MCCARTY- FRIEDMAN SOME OF OUR MEMBERS THINGS- EGGMAN GARCIA APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY- JUST STEP BY WAY OF BACKGROUND REPUBLIC SERVICES HAS SEVENTY NINE RECYCLING FACILITIES IN THE US WE HAVE SIX IN CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE THIRTEEN COMPOST FACILITIES SIX OF WHICH ARE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE TO FOOD WASTE PRE PROCESSING FACILITIES BOTH OF WHICH ARE IN CALIFORNIA SO A LITTLE BIT OF THE LAY OF THE LAND RELATIVE TO OUR RECYCLING- ASSETS I THOUGHT TODAY I WOULD JUST COVER ALL HIGH LEVEL- SOME COVERT RELATED IMPACTS AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DAY TO TALK ABOUT- GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHTS ON OPERATIONAL BEST PRACTICES- TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT NEAR TERM OUTLOOK- AND THEN- SOME CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC. CONSIDERATIONS CRISTINA SLIDE. SO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS LINE. THERE'S LOTS GOING ON IN TWENTY TWENTY SO RELATIVE TO- THE PANDEMIC YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IN Q. ONE WE WERE HIGHLY FOCUSED ON LOCKDOWNS- WHAT THAT MEANT FOR A BUSINESS WHAT THAT WHAT THAT MEANT FOR OUR ASSETS WITH THAT MEANT FOR OUR PEOPLE. AS WE MOVED INTO Q. TWO WE WERE HYPER FOCUSED ON OUR EMPLOYEES SAFETY- MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE DOING THINGS WITH OUR ASSETS TO PROTECT OUR EMPLOYEES- YOU KNOW AS A RELATED TO CHECK IN CHECK OUT I'M JUST STRETCHING OUT SHIP STRETCHING OUT BREAK AREAS. HI AND THE LIKE AND THEN OBVIOUSLY IN Q. TWO AND I'LL SHARE THIS WITH THE- IN A IN AN UPCOMING SLIDE BIG CHANGES IN COMMERCIAL TO RESIDENTIAL VOLUMES BIG CHANGES AND MAX- AS WE MOVED IN THE Q. THREE YOU KNOW TRYING TO DEAL WITH RE OPENING AND WHAT THAT MEANT FOR A BUSINESS. HAS CERTAIN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY- BEGAN RE OPEN AND- HEARING QUEUE FOR YOU KNOW SURGING CASE COUNTS CONTINUATION OF WORK FROM HOME CONTINUATION OF REMOTE LEARNING SO JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THE REST OF THIS YEAR GOING INTO NEXT YEAR. ON THE RECYCLING SIDE YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO TRACK INVESTMENTS- IN DOMESTIC RECYCLING CAPACITY WE'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THAT ALREADY THIS MORNING THAT INVESTMENTS OCCURRING HERE IN THE US WHICH. IS A GREAT THING- YOU. AGAIN DEALING WITH THAT BIG. RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL VOLUMES- INCREASE WE SAW INCREASED DEMAND- FOR CERTAIN GRADES OF MATERIALS AND I CAN. I CAN SHARE THAT- DETAIL WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT LATER- AND THEN YOU KNOW AGAIN MIXED SIGNALS ARE GOING INTO NEXT YEAR SO. FIGURING OUT HOW TO MANAGE- THE BUSINESS- IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY. CHRISTENING SO JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF BEST PRACTICES- YOU CAN SEE A PHYSICAL BARRIER THERE TO THE LEFT- THAT'S PRETTY TYPICAL OF WHAT WE DID. IN THE EARLY DAYS AT ALL OF OUR RECYCLING FACILITIES- WEATHER'S PLEXIGLASS PLEXIGLASS. I SHOWER CURTAINS OR OTHER TYPES OF PHYSICAL BARRIERS WHERE WE COULD NOT MAINTAIN A SIX FOOT SEPARATION. AND THEN IN THIS- IN THE RECYCLING LINE OF BUSINESS YOU KNOW GENERALLY WE WILL TAKE BREAKS ALL SAME TIME- IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE THIRTY FORTY FIFTY PEOPLE WORKING ON ONE OF THESE LOCATIONS ON A SINGLE SHIFT. SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN CREATE SOME ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES- THE TENT ON THE RIGHT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. MAX ON. SO JUST A SIMPLE GRAPHIC- BIG BIG SWINGS IN VOLUME- ADDITIONALLY- COMING OUT LATE MARCH AND EARLY APRIL AGAIN THIS IS NATIONWIDE SAW AS MUCH AS A 30% DECREASE I IN OUR COMMERCIAL LINES AND A COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND WE SAW AS MUCH AS A 25230% INCREASE IN RESIDENTIAL BY HIM. AND YOU KNOW SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW CONTRACTS ARE. CONSTRUCTED- MOST COMMERCIAL RATEPAYERS PAY BY THE YARD WHERE THEY PAY BY THE SERVICE- YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S THREE TIMES A WEEK- EVERY DAY MOST ALMOST PAY BY THE MONTH SO AS- VOLUMES SHIPPED. BY AND AS WE KIND OF APPROACH SOME NEW NORMAL- CONTINUATION OF WORK FROM HOME. THEY WILL PUT ADDITIONAL PRESSURE OVER TIME ON ON THOSE HOMEOWNER RATES. I'M EXCITED. SO JUST A LITTLE BETTER TREND ANALYSIS HERE- THE GRAPHIC TO THE UPPER RIGHT IS RESIDENTIAL VOLUMES AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THAT PRETTY SIGNIFICANT UPTICK- MARCH AND APRIL OFF OF THE BASELINE- WE'VE SEEN THAT TREND DOWN AND THAT'S THE BLUE LINE- THE L. THE YELLOW LINE IS KIND OF OUR FORWARD LOOKING- PROJECTION WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE- FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES REMOTE LEARNING WORK FROM HOME- SOME OF THAT WILL NEVER GET BACK TO NORMAL. ARE CONVERSELY ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE- STEEP DECLINE- AND AGAIN YOU SEE A TAIL OUT IN TWO TWENTY TWENTY ONE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE INDUSTRY THAT WE THINK WILL COME BACK THE SLOWEST. OBVIOUSLY HOSPITALITY- LEISURE- THOSE TYPES OF SPACES SO. OUR NEXT LOVE. SOME PRETTY BIG SHIFTS ARE IN MATERIAL MIX- SO YOU KNOW I MENTION THE VOLUME SHIFTING FROM COMMERCIAL OVER TO RESIDENTIAL BUT YOU THINK ABOUT AT HOME CONSUMPTIVE BEHAVIOR- BIG INCREASE IN SMALL CARDBOARD BOXES- IN THE RESIDENTIAL STREAM WE CALL THAT THE AMAZON EFFECT- BUT DON'T WANT TO EXCLUDE OTHER E-COMMERCE. WORSE IN RECORD AMOUNTS OF PT ALUMINUM AND GLASS- THAT'S ALL THAT THAT HOME CONSUMPTION. THAT OTHERS HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT- ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE. BIG DROP OFF IN THAT LARGE CARDBOARD THAT WE'VE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO- RETAIL DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSING- AND OBVIOUSLY- NOT ALL COMMERCIAL SECTORS HAVE BEEN HURT THE SAME SO GROCERY AND BIG BOX HOME IMPROVEMENT ACTUALLY I'VE HAD A REALLY GOOD YEAR DURING THE PANDEMIC SO- MOST OF OUR COMMERCIAL LINES OFF- SOME OF ITS UP. IN AN INDUSTRIAL WHICH THE MOST OF YOU WOULD CALL ROLL OFF- MOST OF THE PERMANENT BUSINESS WAS NOT IMPACTED- IN STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA THAT CLOSED DOWN CONSTRUCTION. OBVIOUSLY THOSE ROLL OFF CONTAINERS- IN THE EARLY DAYS WERE IMPACTED PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY. BUT WE'VE SEEN MOST OF THAT ACTIVITY COME BACK. AN EXCELLENT. SO A LOT OF DETAIL HERE- WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT CHINA- HISTORICALLY- CHINA IMPORTED ABOUT TWENTY MILLION TONNES OF MATERIAL MOST THAT'S FIBER BASED OR OR PAPER BASED- FROM NORTH AMERICA- HERE- AT THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE FULLY EXPECT THEM TO STEP OUT OF THE MARKET- THERE'S INVESTMENT OCCURRING IN THE U. S. THE MAP THERE AS- AN EXAMPLE OF LARGE. PAPER MILL INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED BUT AS YOU CAN SEE BY WHERE THOSE OBJECTIVES GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCATED THEY'RE GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR CALIFORNIA TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE NEW PROJECTS. SOME DATA HERE ON COMMODITY VALUES- I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF CRB CURBSIDE PAYMENTS- YOU CAN SEE AND Q. ONE. AS A COMPANY OUR COMMODITY VALUES WERE EIGHTY SIX DOLLARS- CALIFORNIA SITES ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN- IN AND YEAR TO DATE NINETY EIGHT AND THAT'S INDICATIVE OF AN IMPROVING COMMODITY MARKET- THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN THE CALIFORNIA SIDE SOARED HIGH FIFTY TWO SO- ABOUT A 55260% PREMIUM- FOR COMMODITIES- IN THE US. THE DATA THE YEAR OVER YEAR BEHIND IT OVER TO THE RIGHT- ARE RECYCLING IN DOWNTOWNS ARE DOWN SIX AND A HALF PERCENT. BUT ROC SEIZE UP FIFTEEN. OUR PAPERS DOWN ALMOST FORTY. THAT'S ALL THAT OFFICE PAPER IT'S ALL IT'S ALL. BLACKMAILERS NOT BRICK AND MORTAR NOT SENDING. OUR CATALOGS THIS YEAR. MAYBE A LITTLE BIT SHOWN UP NOW BUT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR A LOT LESS MAILERS. A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANOMALY FOR US BUT I'M CERTAINLY FROM WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM. FROM SOME OTHERS BUT- OUR ALUMINUM IS ESSENTIALLY FLAT. YEAR OVER YEAR. BUT OUR P. EATING GLASS WROTE 25% ALL RIGHT AND THEN LASTLY- RECYCLES THEY WAS THIS PAST WEEKEND I WE DID A SURVEY AND- NINE MAJOR CITIES LA WAS ONE OF THEM. ABOUT YOU CAN SEE HERE. SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AND SOME FOLKS OF ALL THE MENTIONED. THESE THEMES TODAY- LACK OF SPACE- CONFUSION ON WHAT CAN BE RECYCLED I AM AND THE CONFIDENCE YOU KNOW FOLKS NOT BELIEVING THAT THEIR RECYCLABLES ARE ACTUALLY GETTING RECYCLED SO YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE OUR SURVEY IS THE END ALL BE ALL BUT- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU ALL COULD DO FROM A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT. A MINIMUM CONTENT THIS IS HUGELY IMPORTANT SO SOME DISCUSSION TODAY ON THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BY TEN UP WE SHOULD YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THAT LAST YEAR- HARMONIZED LIST OF ACCEPTABLE RECYCLABLES- I KNOW THERE'S A COMMISSION WORKING ON THAT. HI AS WE SPEAK SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND THEN. A FOCUS ON ANY MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE. THOSE ARE THE THREE PRIMARY THINGS THAT. TO REALLY DRIVE SUCCESS AND RECYCLE MORE. SO THAT WAS THE END MY PRESENTATION OF THE GROUND FOR QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY FIRST YOU CAN YOU CAN STAY RIGHT THERE FOR A SECOND MISTER KELLER ASSEMBLY MEMBER TANK. THANKS SO MUCH JUST QUICK QUESTIONS I KNOW THAT ARMY. WE GET A RENEWED OUR CASE TO PROGRAM WHICH IS- INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR COMPANIES TO INVEST IN YOU KNOW GREEN TECHNOLOGY- MY UNDERSTANDING IS DIFFERENT BASED COMPANIES WERE USING THOSE- USING THAT PROGRAM I JUST WONDERING IF FOR PUBLIC WAS- LOOKING AT THAT PROGRAM TO DO INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM IT'S TO KEEP TE PROGRAM IT'S LIKE A- TAX CREDIT PROGRAM AND OF THE TREASURE'S OFFICE I'M I'M FAMILIAR WITH IT OKAY YEAH BECAUSE YOU'RE BECAUSE YOU'RE A LOT WHEN WE WERE IN RENEWING IT YOUR LOBBYIST CAME TO MY OFFICE AND SPECIFICALLY- TALKED ABOUT. SOME OF THE DIFFERENT IMPROVEMENTS YOU WERE- DOING AT FACILITIES ALL AROUND THE STATE AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS- YOU KNOW MY COMMENT BACK THEN WAS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE INVESTMENTS WERE ACTUALLY OCCURRING. IN THAT OBVIOUSLY THEY KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO ASK HER ONLY IF WE BRING YOU KNOW WE'RE RENEWING OR INCREASING THE SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM. I CAN TELL YOU- THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO THE EXTENT SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE WE'LL LOOK INTO THOSE. CAN YOU MAYBE MAYBE YOU COULD EXPAND ON WHAT INVESTMENT YOU'RE MAKING IN CALIFORNIA- CERTAINLY ARE FOCUSED ON ORGANICS INVESTMENTS. SO EXPANDING- SOME COMPOST CAPABILITIES CAPACITY- IN SO CAL- AGAIN UP HERE- WELL IN THE BAY AREA. EXPANDING OUR FOOD WASTE CAPABILITIES- PLAN ON MAKING A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND- RECYCLING- PROCESSING CAPACITY- IN THE BAY AREA NEXT YEAR AS WELL. PERFECT THANK YOU. BUT I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU WHILE YOU'RE UP THERE AT YOU KNOW THAT THE TRENDS IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS AT FRANKLY INTERESTING BUT ALSO FASCINATING TO PROMOTE YOU KNOW SOCIOLOGY PERSPECTIVE WHAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO DEAL WITH. JUST WONDERING OVERALL CERTAINLY HAVE HAD INCREASES IN SOME AND DECREASES IN OTHERS OVERALL HOW IS THAT IMPACTED YOU KNOW THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF REPUBLICAN AT SOME OF THE OTHER LARGE WASTE HAULERS IN CALIFORNIA WELL COMING INTO THIS YEAR- SOME OF THE COMMODITY VALUES WERE AT HISTORIC LOWS- AND WE SAW THAT TREND CONTINUE INTO Q. ONE- PRE YOU KNOW PRE COVERT PRE LOCKDOWNS- SOME SOME CONSTRAINTS ON. ON THE COMMODITY MARKETS- SINCE SINCE THE PANDEMIC- YEAH THE VALUATION HAS IMPROVED- AND WHILE WE'RE GETTING LESS INBOUND VOLUME- THE OVERALL- ECONOMICS OF RECYCLING HAVE IMPROVED- IN TWENTY TWENTY- YOU KNOW I GUESS I WOULD SHARE THIS IN THIS MIGHT BE A SHOCK TO SOME FOLKS IN THE ROOM BUT- YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF. CURBSIDE RECYCLING IN THE U. **** FIBER BASED SO POSSIBLY 75% OF WHAT WE MAKE AND SELL THIS CARDBOARD MIXED PAPER OTHER FORMS OF FIBER BASED PACKAGING. A LOT OF TALK THIS MORNING ABOUT PLASTIC PLASTIC IS ABOUT 8% OF WHAT WE RECEIVE IN WHAT WE SELL. FIVE SIX REPRESENTS ABOUT 40% OF OUR COMMODITY VALUES. SO IT'S YOU KNOW. IT'S DISPROPORTIONATELY VALUABLE AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE UT HOW TO GET MORE OF THAT RATHER THAN LESS ABOUT SO- OVERALL TO ANSWER THE QUESTION- OVERALL THE CHANGES IN VOLUME AND MIX. HAVE BEEN HELPFUL THIS YEAR. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S GO ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER THAT'S CHASING YOUNG CEO OF ALLEN COMPANY. PLEASE HOLD ON FOR. WELL IN COMPANY- AND IT'S GOING TO BE A QUICK INTRODUCTION ALLEN COMPANY IS- HAS BEEN IN THE RECYCLING BUSINESS SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WE OPERATE FACILITIES BETWEEN FRESNO AND SAN DIEGO ELEVEN OF THEM. WE HAVE- WE DO CRV BY BACK CRV PROCESSING CURBSIDE PROCESSING TRANSFER STATION- WE ARE ALSO COMMERCIAL RECYCLERS INDUSTRIAL RECYCLERS- WE HANDLE SCRAP METAL PAPER PLASTIC GLASS. OUR ALSO DIRECT OVERSEAS EXPORTERS AND HAVE BEEN FOR THE PAST FORTY FIVE YEARS. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT OF I'M I'M GOING TO DIVE INTO THE MARKETS A LITTLE. MORE IN DEPTH YOU KNOW. THE MARKETS ARE STILL SUPPLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND BASED MARKET. SO THERE'S DIFFERENT IMPACTS ON ALL THE COMMODITIES BASED ON CODE SO IF YOU HAVE. SUPPLY BASE YOU HAVE THE OF. YOU KNOW OR YOU HAVE EXTRA DEMAND OR LACK OF SUPPLY WHICH IS CAUSING- YOU KNOW ON THE MARKET TO CHANGE. THE PAPER MARKETS FOR INSTANCE- THEY SPIKED CORRUGATED SIR OCC SPIKED IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF- THE PANDEMIC FOR THREE MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC- PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES DONATED BOXES TO SHIP THEIR GOODS. BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE OF. BUT THERE WAS NO SUPPLY BECAUSE THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES WERE ALL SHATTERED. FOR THE STAY HOME ORDERS WHICH BECAUSE THE BECAUSE THE A LACK OF SUPPLY INCREASE IN PRICING. SAME THING FOR THE TISSUE BUSINESS THE TISSUE BUSINESSES YOU KNOW IT IT IS PRIMARILY RECYCLED OR MADE OUT OF RECYCLED PAPER. WHEN THEY SHUT DOWN THE OFFICES THERE WASN'T ANY SUPPLY RECYCLE PAPER BECAUSE THE PRICING TO GO UP. ALLEN TISSUE CAUGHT UP TO ITSELF THE PRICING CAME BACK TO. THE PLASTIC MARKET FELL DRAMATICALLY IN THE. IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC. OVER 40% FOR PT WHICH IS THE BIGGEST COMMODITY THAT WE HANDLE- AND THE MAIN REASON IT FAILS BECAUSE OF THE LOW OIL PRICE. THE OIL PRICE YOU KNOW WHEN OIL GETS TO BE A NEGATIVE PRICE WAS FOR A HALF A DAY OR A DAY IT. WAS TRADING AT A NEGATIVE. AT YOU CAN JUST SEE THAT THE THAT'S THE SUBSTITUTE FOR RECYCLE PLASTIC IS THE VIRGIN PLASTIC SO- SO IT BECAUSE THE PLASTIC MARKETS TO CRATER. THEY HAVE RECOVERED SOME SENSE IN THE LAST MONTH OR TWO MOST OF THAT RECOVERY- IN MY ESTIMATION IS DUE TO THE- IS DUE TO THE- MINIMUM CONTENT. THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED THAT HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE MARKETS. FROM THE CLASS PRICES REMAINED UNCHANGED AND IT LARGELY REMAINS UNCHANGED YEAR OVER YEAR- HAVE THE MAIN REASON IT NEVER REALLY CHANGES IS BECAUSE IT'S- IT'S- VIRGIN SUBSTITUTE IS- SAND. WHICH DOESN'T HAVE VERY MUCH VALUE SO- THE VOLUMES FOR GLASS WERE OFF VOTE AROUND 5% AND THAT'S PRIMARILY WITH THE RESTAURANTS AND BARS BEING CLOSE. ALUMINUM FELL. FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC- IT WAS MORE OF A- NATION WIDE FALLING ALUMINUM THERE WAS A SHORTAGE AND ALUMINUM CANS BUT THERE WAS A NATIONWIDE FALLING ALUMINUM PRICING PRIMARILY TO THE AUTO INDUSTRY SLOWING DOWN THEY CONSUME A LOT OF RECYCLING. AND- IT HAS RECOVERED SOME. IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE MONTHS SO IT'S KID LOOKS LIKE IT'S CONTINUING TO RECOVER. I'M I WANTED TO DELVE INTO THE EXPORT MARKETS JUST A LITTLE BIT I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HIM- AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES IN THE EXPORT MARKET OVER THE PAST. YOU KNOW. YOU'RE ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT CHINA SHUTTING OFF RECYCLABLES. THAT'S A HUGE HUGE MARKET FOR US AND- A LOT OF THE OTHER FOREIGN MARKETS HAVE PICKED UP VOLUME AND CREATED PROCESSING TO HELP. CONSUME THE PRODUCT THAT WOULD GO TO CHINA FOR THE FINISHED PRODUCT SO. THEY'RE MAKING THE BOXES IS STILL THERE JUST BEING MADE A DIFFERENT COUNTRY- AS YOU GO COUNTRY BY COUNTRY YOU KNOW KOREA HAD MAJOR IMPACTS YOU KNOW THEY HAD A LOCKDOWN FROM MARCH THROUGH JUNE. BECAUSE HUGE SUPPLY DEMAND SWINGS AND- DIFFICULT FOR THEM- THEY WERE AT IT BECAUSE PART OF THE SPIKE IN- OCC PRICE WAS DUE TO THAT. IN CHINA OF COURSE THEY SHUT OFFERS. BUT THEY ARE HAD WHAT DOWN ORDER. INDIA AXE CLOSE REPORT FOR FORTY FIVE DAYS. BECAUSE OF PANDEMIC. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY X. RAM FOR FIVE. V. SHUT DOWN THERE. BECAUSE THE TOO MUCH OF ALL COMING IN THE COUNTRY WEREN'T ABLE TO HANDLE THE VOLUME- THAILAND. SURPRISINGLY INCREASED CONSUMPTION AND IS PUTTING CAPACITY TO HELP- OVER THE LOSS IN CHINA- INDONESIA HAD STRICT LOCKDOWN- ORDERS AND THEY HAD A FREEZE ON IMPORTS FOR ABOUT FORTY DAYS- SO THE EACH MARKET IS INDIVIDUAL AND THE COMMODITIES THAT WE THE OWNER ARE TRADED WORLDWIDE. AND I JUST WANTED YOU KNOW IMPOSE ON YOU THAT IT'S THAT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA CAN DO SOME THINGS TO HELP THE MARKETS BUT- THEY'RE ALSO THERE'S A WORLDWIDE FACTORS THAT CALIFORNIA CAN'T REALLY- IT'LL CHANGE- THE LAST THING I WANTED TO TOUCH ON IS- THE PORTS IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A BIG CONGESTION AT THE PORTS THE LAST TWO MONTHS AS THE ECONOMY HAS STARTED O RECOVER. AND IMPORTS OF STARTED TO SURGE THERE'S A THERE'S BEEN THE PORCH AT A CRITICAL POINT TO MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR EXPORTS TO GET THROUGH THE PORTS. AND- YOU KNOW THAT'S CAUSING MARKETS TO BE VERY- DISRUPTED THAT'S ALL AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'M HERE THANK YOU I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL- GO TO THE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL.

THAT BY CAN- I FINALLY CRAZY CHIP THE COURT DOES- HOW YOU GET A. AND AND- SUPPORT- TO PROVIDE LIKE YOU CAR. REGARDING LOOKING COMING INTO SOME KIND OF A LINE BARRIER I JUST RECOGNIZE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO EXPLORE. WORST OVER THE YEARS TO COLLECT MORE AND MORE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLASTICS- AND- AND USUALLY HAD MARKETS WITHIN CHINA WHERE WE HAD DIRECT LINE OF SIGHT FOR THE FIFTY HAVE TIME FACTOR DO. I'M A BIG FOR A MARKETED- BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO US THAT WE WANT- CONTRIBUTING TO DUMPING OF BURNING ARE CONTAMINATING THE ENVIRONMENT. UNDER CYCLE CLASSIC- THOSE MARKETS CLOSED CLOSED PRETTY DOWN FOR QUICKLY AND THE TWENTY THIRD ORCHESTRA ON THE PRODUCTS CHINA COULDN'T QUITE AND- THEN YOU KNOW BECOMING PRETTY- A JOURNAL- TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY. I'M GREAT WE BEEN TAKING THE LOVE NANBAN FIVE ONE TIME ABOUT IT EVERYTHING THAT MICHAEL THE RECYCLE BIN PLASTIC IT IS NOT OF. SO PVG AND ITS BOTTLES ARE REALLY ONLY THING THAT HAVE THE LAB IN MY AT THIS TIME AND- REALLY TO SEE DOES MUCH MORE CLOSE WITH AND GOING BOTTOM TO BOTTLE AND THEN THE FIRST ON. STANDARD THAT PASSED LAST YEAR- A REALLY CRITICAL YOU CREATING MARK BUT BY BOB AND- NOT JUST YOU KNOW MAKING SOME OTHER DURABLE GOODS THAT EVENTUALLY GOING TO END UP IN THE- BUT I'M MARKING- FOR THAT NON BY CLAM ARE YOUR GOT THIS MINUTES COMMUTE YOU OCT PLEASE WRAP UP THE TEST. THANK YOU. INCREASE IN THE DEPOSIT THAT WOULD PUT US ON PAR I AM VERY QUICKLY WITH MORGAN AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS ORGAN SYSTEM. FOR RECYCLERS- I USUALLY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. HOW DID FOR THE PAST A LOT. OKAY WHO'S THE- SECOND. OKAY THANK YOU I WE HAVE RICK TOMLINSON PRESIDENT OF THE CAL STRAWBERRY COMMISSION. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS COMMITTEE WITH AN UPDATE ON THE ACTIVITY THAT BERRY FARMERS ARE UNDERTAKING AND REGARDS TO PACKAGING. IN NOW- YOUR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ON ALL THESE GLOBAL POLICY CHANGES OCCURRED- THAT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION AND WE HAD SOME MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY YOU KNOW PROACTIVELY REACHING OUT TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT THESE IMPACTS MY LOOK LIKE. WE STARTED COLLABORATING AND REACHING OUT WITH- PEOPLE THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY THE FOLKS THAT MAKE OUR PAKAGES ARE WANTED TO TALK TO THEM- THAT LED US TO TALK TO THEM THE MERCHANT AND- THE WHOLE. RECYCLING STREAM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON AND SLOWLY ALL THAT CAME TOGETHER. AND ULTIMATELY- THAT LET US TO OUR FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR- MAKING A PLEDGE- THROUGHOUT THE VERY SUPPLY CHAIN IN THE ENTIRE WESTERN HEMISPHERE NORTH AMERICA SOUTH AMERICA. ONLINE UPDATING THE CLAM SHELL PACKAGING THAT WE CURRENTLY USE. IT IT- AND ALL THAT SPEAK ABOUT A MINUTE BUT FIRST JUST YEAH I IN REGARDS TO- THAT EFFORT AND WHO'S INVOLVED. SO THE- THE FIRST SLIDE AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE A SLIGHT I'M NOT YEAH I DO SEE A SLIDE. YES WE DO OKAY SO THE FIRST LIGHT IS- A SAMPLE OF THE- TRADE ASSOCIATIONS DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PULL TOGETHER AND- TO REALLY- COORDINATE ACROSS ALL THESE DIFFERENT STATES AND COUNTRIES AND REGIONS YEAH BECAUSE UNLIKE- YOU KNOW THINGS THAT YOU THAT YOU MIGHT- TYPICALLY THINK OF COMING FROM A FACTORY LINE RIGHT THESE. BERRIES ARE BEING PACKAGED- THAT APPLE FARM SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF FARMS ACROSS ALL THESE DIFFERENT STATES AND REGIONS AND REALLY NEEDING TO COORDINATE- THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAY THAT- BERRIES ARE PACKAGE JUSTIN BERRY PICKING UP STRAWBERRIES ARE PACKAGED- DIFFERENTLY- THAN BLUEBERRIES AND PACKAGED DIFFERENTLY THAN RASPBERRY SO- JUST ALL THOSE LITTLE DETAILS ARE WORKING THROUGH ALL THAT- BUT WE WERE WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THE COMMITMENT OF THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN- THAT COMES INTO NORTH AMERICA. AND IS PREDOMINATELY- SUPPLIED OUT OF NORTH AMERICA WITH A SOME IMPORTS FROM SOUTH AMERICA. YEAH SO- SO FOR IF I COULD TO AND NOW TURN SLIDE. YEAH- THE CURRENT CLAM SHELL SO. FOR JUST OVER TWENTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN USING THE PLASTIC CLAM CHOWDER CLAM SHELL IN IN STRAWBERRIES AND- IN THE OTHER BIRDS AS WELL AND YEAH WE REALLY BENEFITTED FROM THE RECYCLING GOING ON IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT CLAM SHELL- HAS TYPICALLY CONTAIN THE MOST AMOUNT OF CALIFORNIA RECYCLE CONTENT OF ANY FOOD PACKAGE IN THE UNITED STATES. AND SO FOR MANY YEARS- WE THOUGHT HEY WE'RE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB BUT OF COURSE IT'S NOT YOU KNOW AFTER WE'VE RECYCLED THE BOTTLES INTO THE CLAM SHELL THEN WHERE DOES THE CLAM SHELL GO AND SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT HAS TO BE SOLVED. SO THE FIRST THING YOU KNOW WHO WE STARTED LIKE I DESCRIBED- COORDINATING WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS OTHER INDUSTRIES IN THE RECYCLING SUPPLY CHAIN. WE STARTED TESTING- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS ALTERNATE MATERIALS FIBER CARDBOARD YEAH- THE IMAGE THAT YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT IS- CARDBOARD AT. CALLED TRAYS- AND THEN WITHIN THAT ARE CARDBOARD CLAM SHELLS INSTEAD OF PLASTIC CLAM SHELLS. OUT ITS COLLAPSE THERE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS THE MOISTURE IN THE BERRIES WAS ABSORBED BY THE CARDBOARD CLAM SHELL. THAT THEN TRANSFERRED IT INTO THE TRAY THAT THAT PROVIDES THE STRUCTURE SO THAT YOU KNOW THE FREE DOESN'T GET SQUISHED AND YOU CAN SEE IF IT COLLAPSED. AL BUT I'LL SAY THAT PICTURE IS IN OUR VIEW AN EXAMPLE OF SUCCESS IN THE SENSE OF PROGRESS YEAH BECAUSE WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH FIBER RIGHT SO I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING. IN TERMS OF PLASTIC BUT OUR WORK IN FIBER AND IT'S NOT JUST OUR WORK THE WORK OF MANY PACKAGING COMPANIES IN IN FIBER IS STILL GOING ON SO- SO WE LOOK AT LIKE SAID THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF A PROGRESS AND- AND I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE. NICHE% OPPORTUNITIES- WOULDN'T AMOUNT TO A AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE. BECAUSE THAT PLASTIC SHELL- ACHIEVE SO MANY OTHER- STANDARDS AND I IN PARTICULAR IF WE THINK OF FOOD SAFETY ALSO IF WE THINK OF FOOD WASTE- THE CLAM SHELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABSORBING THE MOISTURE OUT WE GET A LONGER SHELF LIFE IN THE FRUIT M. AND SO WE REDUCED OF THE FOOD WASTE. ALSO BECAUSE IT'S VERY VERY LIGHT YOU TALKED ABOUT WASTE REDUCTION I MEAN YOU KNOW THESE CLAM SHELLS HAVE BEEN OPTIMIZED TO DOWN TO THE GRAHAM- IN TERMS OF. ACHIEVING THE LEAST AMOUNT OF PLASTIC TO DO ITS JOB. ANDPART OF THAT ALSO IS TO BE LIGHT WEIGHT SO THAT FOR SHIPPING IT REDUCES ENERGY COSTS- FOR SHIPPING SO. LOTS OF BENEFICIAL PURPOSES TO THAT CURRENT CLAM SHELL. BUT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE IT- THE ONE BARRIER THAT WE IMMEDIATELY SIZE THAT WE USE OUR PAPER AND- ON THE LABEL. AND WHILE THERE CAN BE RECYCLED IT IT DEFINITELY CAUSES A CHALLENGE AND CAN GUM UP THE SYSTEM THERE AND- IT WITH THE RECYCLERS AS THEY TRY AND WASH OUT OFTEN THE GLUE. AND SO THE- THE STANDARD- THAT WE FOUND- WAS TO SWITCH TO A B. O. P. P. LABEL- SAME TYPE A LABEL THAT YOU SEE ON THOSE- BEVERAGE BOTTLES- THAT'S ALSO MADE OUT OF PLASTIC SO THAT THE LABEL CAN BE RECYCLED ITSELF AS WELL. AND AND SO IN FEBRUARY WE MADE THE COMMITMENT AS THE INDUSTRY TO SWITCH A 100% OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO THAT B. O. P. P. LABEL. AND WE'RE TALKING JUST A LITTLE TINY BIT OF MATERIAL THERE BUT- IT WAS SURPRISING. JUST AS A INDUSTRY SWITCH- WE SAW THE- PRICE GOUGING OCCURRING- 90% HIGHER THAN WHAT IT SHOULD BE- IT QUICKLY SETTLED OUT IN PART BECAUSE THERE'S A HEALTHY- MARKETPLACE OF SUPPLIERS M. BECAUSE- WE- PART OF OUR WHOLE REASON FOR COORDINATING AS- THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY IS TO TRY AND CREATE ECONOMIES OF SCALE. AND SO- THAT IS THEN YOU KNOW TO OUR NEXT STEP AND THE ULTIMATE STEP WHICH IS- GETTING OUR OWN CLAM SHELLS BACK. AND SO- I'M I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT THE FIRST PURCHASE. FOR THERMOFORM CLEAN WASH LAKE WHICH IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU RECYCLE CLAMSHELL- IT HAS OCCURRED IN IN TWENTY TWENTY- WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY SMALL AMOUNT BUT- BUT IT IS STARTING. AND AND THE FIRST THING THAT WE'VE OBSERVED IN THAT PROCESS IS THAT- BECAUSE THERE'S NOT BEEN A MARKET PLACE PREVIOUSLY- THEY'RE JUST A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF CLAM SHELLS ARE CURRENTLY BEING RECYCLED- IN SOME. REGIONS IN THE STATE THEY ARE BUT NOT ALL. AND SO- THAT'S THAT'S OUR NEXT STEP IS TO. NOT ONLY JUST MAKE THE PURCHASES BUT TO WORK WITH THE RECYCLING SUPPLY CHAIN TO- ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO RECYCLE AS WELL AS AT THE CURBSIDE PROGRAMS TO COLLECT THOSE CLAM SHELLS SO THAT WE CAN GET HIM INTO THAT RECYCLING PIPELINE SO WE CAN BUY THAT FROM A FORM CLEAN WASH LIKE. SO THAT IS WHERE WE'RE AT IN. CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRIES IN THEM AND THE BERRY INDUSTRY FOR NORTH AMERICA AND YEAH. PLEASED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE OKAY THANK YOU HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS HERE BUT I DO WANT TO GO BACK. TO THE FIRST SPEAKER MISTER KELLER CAN YOU COME BACK UP HERE WE HAVE ASSEMBLY WOMAN. GARCIA FROM HER DISTRICT. WHO WANTS TO- TALKED ABOUT SOME ISSUES THANK YOU. SO SHE JUST STARTS TALKING YEAH YEAH. SO THEY START OVER YES GO AHEAD CRISTINA. YEAH I THINK YOU AND I SEE THIS QUESTION COULD MAYBE BE FOR ANY OF THE PANELISTS- ARE THAT YOU HAVE ON THE SECTION JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE INCREASED USE OF PESONAL PROTECTIVE- PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND THE PLASTIC THAT WE SEE IN THAT AND HOW THAT'S IT WE HAVE ANY DATA ABOUT. THAT IN OUR WASTE STREAM ON AND HOW WE'RE MANAGING THAT. I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC DATA- WEEK WE HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN. I THINK WE HEARD SOME OTHERS SPEAKERS SAY THE SAME THING WE HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN- MASKS AND GARMENTS AND GLOVES ARE SHOWING UP IN A RECYCLING FACILITIES WHICH IS TROUBLING- THAT'S CONTAMINATION FOR US THERE ARE NOT. AND MARKETS FOR THOSE TYPES OF MATERIALS- BUT YOU KNOW I WOULD EXPECT THAT. AND- WE SEE ADDITIONAL UPTICK- IN OUR IN A STUDY STREAMS AS WELL- AND THEN I YOU KNOW I CAN ONLY IMAGINE YOU KNOW WHAT THE HOSPITALS AND SOME OF THE OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE DEALING WITH. THE THAT THEY'RE UTILIZING BUT- NOT AND THAT NO SPECIFIC DATE- THERE THERE'S PROBABLY- SO. THAT WE CAN DIG UP IN TERMS OF P. P. E. PRODUCTION AND SALES- THAT- WE COULD PROBABLY- YOU KNOW DO SOME MATH AROUND- WHAT THAT MEANS FOR A GENERATION OF WASTE. DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SORT OF A PLAN FOR THAT OR- YOU CAN SHOW CAMPAIGN ARE. SHE WILL BE BEING PROACTIVE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT- AT THE PAST IN THE PAST- ON THE YOU KNOW OUR THEY'RE VIABLE AND MARKETS FOR THOSE TYPES OF MATERIALS- YOU KNOW A MASK- YOU KNOWSEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIALS SO MULTI MATERIAL ASSEMBLY FOR GARMENTS YOU USUALLY HAVE SOME WOVEN NON WOVEN- MULTIPLE TYPES OF RESIN SO THE RECYCLING THOSE MATERIALS. CAN BE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING THAT'S CHALLENGING IN IN A LOT OF RECYCLING MARKET PLACES PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH EXPORT MARKETS- ANY ANY. FORM OF MATERIAL THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL WASTE- IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR- ACCEPTANCE OF MATERIALS- AND COULD LEAD TO THE REJECTIONS OF ENTIRE LOADS. I THINK THE UNITED I THINK THOSE MATERIALS ARE BEST MANAGED IN THE GARBAGE. ACTITUD MARTIN AT THE ECOLOGY AND I WOULD JUST SAY- VERY SIMILARLY WE'VE SEEN SOME IN OUR RECYCLING PROGRAM- WE THINK THE MESSAGE IS PRETTY CLEAR OUT THERE THAT THESE ARE- TO BE PUT IN THE GARBAGE AND NOT MOST LIKELY. BUT WE HAVE SEEN SOME- IF WE WERE TO TAKE A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO THEM I WOULD SAY REALLY FOCUSING ON REVIEWS- AND RE USABLE FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER- THE END AVERAGE RESIDENTS HAVE A REUSABLE MASK. IS IMPORTANT AS OPPOSED TO A DISPOSABLE AND BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND WHAT WASHING AND SANITIZING ANYTHING OF THE PERPETRATORS AND THEN FOR THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY I'M REALLY YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE DOING A LOT OF REVIEWS ON WASHING- REUSABLE ABOUT SUPPOSED TO THE DISPOSABLE MODEL THAT OUR MEDICAL. SYSTEM AND IS BASED ON CURRENTLY- AND FINALLY I WOULD JUST SAY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE- REQUIRING MINIMUM CONTENT- RECYCLE CONTACT FOR SOME OF THOSE PLASTIC PRODUCTS THAT ARE DISPOSABLE I WOULD BE A WAY TOO EARLY- HELP IMPROVE THE MARKET- FOR RECYCLED. I TELL. ARE THERE A MODELS ANYWAY. ON I'M PP AND- RECYCLABILITY OR AT COULD LOOK AT TO LEARN FROM. MATURE HELP WITH THE HARM- THAT DAY DONE A LOT OF WORK REASONABLE THAN- AND- HOSPITAL ON AND MEDICAL- AND I DO HAVE SOME MODEL- I'M NOT SURE ABOUT NATIONAL CERTAINLY IN THE NATIONAL SCALE AND I CAN PROVIDE SOME- CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THEM AND YOU'RE INTERESTED. ARE YOU PLEASE BECAUSE AND OF MY I LOOK THOSE ALL MY BY THING YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FOR THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN ACTUALLY I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT- FROM THE WITNESS FROM THE STRAWBERRY COMMISSION THAT IT'S REALLY WONDERFUL TO SEE- A GROUP YOU DON'T INDUSTRY GROUP REALLY GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY TO TRY TO BE A GOOD STEWARD FOR THEIR PRODUCT- VERY APPRECIATED I WILL CERTAINLY FEEL GOOD BUYING MY STRAWBERRIES. THANK YOU YEAH. THANK YOU AND- I DID ASK QUESTIONS EARLIER FOR MISTER KELLER AT YOU KNOW ONE THING I JUST I FIND IT REALLY INTERESTING AND OUT ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN I WOULD. TALK ABOUT SOFT LINE WE HAD A HEARING. ON MONDAY ABOUT- PLASTIC WASTE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNTS. OF OF WASTE THAT HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF NEGATIVE EXTERNALITY ON OUR SOCIETY IT'S NOT FRANKLY PAPER AND CARDBOARD- THOSE AND I DO GETTING IN THE RIVER WATER STREAM PROBABLY. BIODEGRADABLE ANYWAY. AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME- YOU KNOW- GLASS AND CANS NOT THEIRS IS JUST PLASTICS SO I FIND IT. FASCINATING THAT. IT'S PROBABLY AS FAR AS OUR WASTE STREAM IMPACTS TO SOCIETY OUR- PUBLIC HEALTH. OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR WILDLIFE. BUT IT'S ONLY 8% OF THE STUFF THAT WE- PUT OUT IN THE DAN'S INTAKE TO EITHER RECYCLING FACILITIES. OR LANDFILLS AND SO AGAIN. THIS GETS BACK TO THE ISSUE IS WERE. FIGHTING AND STRUGGLING TO WHAT TYPE OF CANS AND RINSING OUT AND YOU KNOW MY KIDS ARE. CHICKEN THE PEANUT BUTTER CONTAINER FOR MULTIPLE DAYS OF WATER TO GET A PERFECTLY. CLEAN TO GET IN THE BIN BUT LIKE. YOU KNOW. IT IT MAYBE WE SHOULD TURN IT BACK ON IT ON ITS IS AS% REALLY- TALK OF THE PRODUCERS AND- WE'RE DOING OUR BEST AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN EGGMAN SAID AS CONSUMERS TRYING TO TRYING TO RECYCLE AND EVEN DURING THESE TOUGH TIMES AND- THIS IS THIS BASADI BEEN TOLD OVER AND OVER THROUGH IN THE BLUE BAND YOU'RE ALL GOOD YOU CAN RECYCLE THESE PRODUCTS RUGGED DON'T WORRY ABOUT BUYING WATER BOTTLES AS OPPOSED TO HYDRO FLASK BECAUSE THEY CAN ALL BE I'LL BE RECYCLED AND SO. WE KNOW THAT THAT'S THAT NOT NOT TRUE AND SO- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE IN THE INDUSTRY IN AMERICA'S YOU KNOW DOING WHAT WHAT WHAT THEY CAN'T DO BUT AGAIN THIS IS PART OF A BIGGER PICTURE THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON- AND THE BEGINNINGS OF THESE- AT THESE PRODUCTS TO GET INTO SOCIETY AND OUR VOICESTREAM AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO- I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS.

FOR THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY SO I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE- WORST OF THEM WITH ALL THE ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS IT'S JUST REALLY GOOD TO SEE AN INDUSTRY BEING PROACTIVE NOT.

AND GOT CUT OFF ON MONDAY SO- NEVER EVEN TOUCHED BY SOMEONE TALK ABOUT BOTH ISSUES. WHAT THINK THE PLASTIC RECYCLING CORPORATION CALIFORNIA IS A INDUSTRY SPONSORED VOLUNTARY STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. IT WE HAVE. THE GOAL IS TO GET EVERY SINGLE BEVERAGE BOTTLE IN CALIFORNIA. PTP RECYCLED AND I THINK OUR POINT OF OUR COMMENTS TODAY ARE ALL PLASTICS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL. AND THEN THE RECYCLING SYSTEM FOR PTT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TOOK THE BOTTLE BILL WHICH WAS PASSED AND THE- EXCEPTIONAL JOB PRIOR TO KOBE. OF COLLECTING MATERIALS IN A FACT THE PRCC HANDLED MUGS ABOUT FORTY THE BUCKLEY 40% OF THE P. E. T. OF SCRAP MATERIAL COLLECTED IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE SUPPLY CONTRACT WITH- WE KLEBER'S AND RECYCLERS THAT ARE TURNING INTO THE NEXT. LEVEL PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDE FROM CLAM SHELL BE HEARD THAT THE THAT THE- STARBIRD COMMISSION IS DEALING WITH IT ALL THE WAY TO FOSTER. BONTA YEAH THE PRTC TO- OWN ADDRESSED TO. AND WILL KEEP TO WORK ON THIS AS WE APPROACH THE SEVEN THREE BETTER TRY BEEN A CARPET WE'RE- IT SURE THAT WE HAVE AS A ENTITY DON'T SENSE CODE. THE SYSTEM HAS REALLY OUT QUITE A BIT IT'S THIS GUY- AND THERE IS A- WORKING LOWER RESPECT RATE HAS INCREASED THE AVERAGE FOR. THERE MAY BE WHAT TO IN THE AND MODERN. THESE TO BE THAT EFFICIENCY BUT ALL IF. THE FIFTH LAST YEAR WORKED WITH THE HERE REP. TO TRY TO GET TEMP FUNDING WHICH YOU THINK SHOULD BE. EXTENDED FROM THE UNREDEEMED PLAN TO HELP BOLSTER THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS WE LOOK TOWARDS THIS YEAR FOR MODERNIZING THE SYSTEM AND EXPANDING OPTIONS LIKE THE BAG DROP REVERSE VENDING MACHINES.

THE BOTTLE BILL NEEDS TO BE FIXED- MAJOR OVERHAUL AND THERE'S TWO KEY PLAYERS INCLUDING ALLEN COMPANY MEANS- OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT WANT TO HELP. CONSUMERS GET THEIR DEPOSIT BACK- AS DENNIS ABI ON YOU MENTIONED THE FUND HAS GROWN BY OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. INTHE LAST YEAR TO COPE WITH IT AND OTHER ISSUES AND THAT'S MONEY THAT CONSUMERS ARE NOT SPENDING IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY- A HUGE REASON IS WE HAVE AREAS WITHOUT RECYCLING CENTERS. IN A WAY THAT RECYCLING CENTERS GET PAID IT DOESN'T WORK IN SOME AREAS THE BAY AREA AND ONE OF THE MOST UNDERSERVED AREAS. WHERE RECYCLING CENTERS HEADLINES FROM EIGHT AM TO FIVE PM AND THEY'RE BARELY MAKING IT BY- SO WE NEED A MAJOR OVERHAUL OF THE PROGRAM THE GROCERS WANT TO HELP BUT THEY NEED TO BE PAID. IT'S A BIG PART IN THE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW WHERE IF PEOPLE TAKE CONTAINERS BACK TO THE STORES GROCERS DON'T GET PAID FOR THEIR EFFORTS. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT THAT WANT TO HELP WITH THAT- BUT RIGHT NOW THE WAY THE PAYMENTS WORK THEY JUST DON'T GET PAID FOR HELPING OUT- BUT THERE ARE OTHER INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE BURST MACHINES. BACKDROP GRAMS OF ARE YOU DEMOCRATS. ALL THOSE CAN HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA YOU CAN HAVE A MUCH BETTER PROGRAM. WE JUST NEED A MAJOR OVERHAUL AND- MING'S RECYCLING- AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WERE WERE READY TO HELP WITH. THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU THANK YOU THE- THERE ARE NO FOR COMMENTS.
