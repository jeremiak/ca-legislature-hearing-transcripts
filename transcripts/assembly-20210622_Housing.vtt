TODAY AND I APPRECIATE BEING

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:05.781
ABLE TO HEAR IT- YEAH I THINK

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:07.616
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:08.851
THE COMMENTS I HEARD WERE

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:10.352
ACTUALLY ALMOST ADDRESSING

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:11.754
WHETHER WE SHOULD BE APPROVING

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.822
SB THREE THIRTY THAT IS IN FACT

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:18.193
LAW RIGHT NOW. IN ALL THIS IS

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.728
AN EXTENSION TWO THREE THIRTY.

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:21.997
BUT MY QUESTION IS THE SUNSET

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:23.098
FOR THAT IS IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:26.168
FIVE. AND SO IT ONLY HAS HAD A

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:27.836
YEAR OF NORMAL OPERATING

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:30.739
ENVIRONMENT. AND THEN COATED.

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:32.574
TO BE ABLE TO GET A FULL FLAVOR

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:34.109
FOR THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:36.178
THAT THIS MAY HAVE. OR ANY OF

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.980
THE BENEFITS THAT IT MIGHT

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.848
HAVE- THAT WAS INTENDED FOR.

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.817
AND THAT SO MY QUESTION IS WHY

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:43.652
ARE WE TRYING TO DO AN

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:45.154
EXTENSION FOR SOMETHING THE SUN

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.556
SETS. IN FOUR YEARS WHEN WE

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:49.191
COULD WAIT ANOTHER TWO OR THREE

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.826
YEARS TO SEE IF THIS IS

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:53.595
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMMER NOT- OR

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:54.363
IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:55.731
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.900
MIGHT WANT TO BE. ADDRESSED IF

01:13:57.966 --> 01:13:59.468
SOMEBODY WANTS TO ATTEMPT TO

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:01.870
EXTEND THIS AND ALSO WHY FOR

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:04.640
THE ENTIRE FIVE YEARS FROM

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:07.376
TWENTY FIVE TO. TWENTY THIRTY-

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:10.445
BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:12.681
BIT PREMATURE FOR ME- I

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:13.482
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION VERY

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:17.085
GOOD QUESTION- WHEN WE FIRST.

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:21.356
THE WHEN I SAID IT DOESN'T

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:25.127
CHANGE LOCAL LAWS. IT

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:28.964
ABSOLUTELY RESPECTS THE ZONING

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:31.133
THE DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS THE

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.101
LAND USE POLICIES THAT ARE ON

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:34.636
THE BOOKS AT THE POINT THAT IT

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:37.439
BECAME LAW WHICH WAS JANUARY

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:39.474
ONE TWENTY TWENTY. AND IT IN

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:42.311
EFFECT HOLDS THOSE IN PLACE

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:44.179
WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS BUT IT

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:46.048
HOLDS THOSE IN PLACE THEN FOR

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:47.850
THE PERIOD THE BILL'S EFFECTIVE

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:49.618
AND AS YOU POINTED OUT MY

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.887
PURPOSE TODAY IS TO HOLD THOSE

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:54.623
IN PLACE FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:56.091
YEARS TILL TWENTY THIRTY AND

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.492
PARTLY BECAUSE DURING THE

01:14:57.559 --> 01:14:59.361
PANDEMIC AS MANY OF US KNOW.

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:01.530
MANY OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS-

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:02.931
PERMIT ISSUING OFFICES IN

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.566
EFFECT CLOSEST AND THEY'RE

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.168
PLANNING COMMISSIONS- ZONING

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:07.502
BOARDS DID NOT MEET YOU KNOW

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.538
JUST LIKE WE DID EVERYBODY WAS

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:10.706
ADJUSTING TO THE PANDEMIC WE

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:13.208
KNOW THAT THERE WAS ALSO A HALT

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:14.176
ON CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES FOR

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:18.046
AWHILE. SO THE REASON I WANTED

01:15:18.113 --> 01:15:20.482
TO ALLOW IT THIS BILL TO HAVE

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:22.217
MORE TIME IS BECAUSE THE

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:24.553
HOUSING CRISIS IS STILL HERE

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:27.022
ALL OF THE REASONS WHY THREE

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:30.692
THIRTY WERE NEEDED STILL REMAIN

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:33.629
AND- THAT WHEN WE-

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:35.130
NOTWITHSTANDING THE VARIOUS

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:36.665
CRITICISMS THAT SOME OF THE

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:39.534
CALLERS CALLED IN THIS ONE

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:42.437
REALLY JUST SAYS IF THERE IS A

01:15:42.504 --> 01:15:44.706
HOUSING AN APPLICATION THAT

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:46.808
MEETS YOUR RULES LET'S JUST

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:48.844
GIVE IT SOME TIME CERTAIN FOR

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:50.812
THE PROCESSING AND THEY'RE

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.981
STILL YOU KNOW LOTS OF PUBLIC

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.616
HEARINGS THAT ARE ALLOWED AT

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:57.753
LEAST FIVE FOR EXAMPLE. AND

01:15:57.819 --> 01:16:01.223
THERE IS- THE ABILITY TO

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:03.325
NEGOTIATE WITH THE PROJECT

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:05.994
APPLE APPLICANT FOR YOU KNOW

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:07.696
THINGS TO ADDRESS THE

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:08.864
COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS THERE'S

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.832
NOTHING THAT PREVENTS THE LOCAL

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.467
GOVERNMENT FROM DOING THAT BUT

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:14.403
WHAT THIS DOES IN THE BENEFIT

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:16.371
OF EXTENDING IT IS IT IT LEAST

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:18.373
GIVES AN APPLICANT THE

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.609
CERTAINTY BECAUSE AS WE KNOW TO

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:22.277
PUT ALL THE MATERIALS TOGETHER

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:23.779
THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:26.581
OFTEN REQUIRED IN ORDER TO BE

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.583
ABLE TO HAVE YOU'RE A PROJECT

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:30.485
HEARD ITS THIRD THOSE ARE

01:16:30.552 --> 01:16:31.887
EXTENSIVE AND THEN IN THE

01:16:31.954 --> 01:16:33.555
PROCESS OF THOSE HEARINGS AS

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:35.590
YOU'RE NEGOTIATING CHANGES TO

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:37.626
ADDRESS COMMUNITY CONCERNS YOU

01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:39.394
ALSO SOMETIMES HAVE TO GO BACK

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:40.963
TO THE DRAWING BOARD. SO WE

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:42.731
KNOW THAT EVEN WITH THE

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:44.466
CERTAINTY AND THE TIME FRAMES

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:48.603
THAT THIS BILL- PROVIDES. ARE

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:50.138
AT PRIVATE YOU KNOW HOUSING IT

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:52.341
TAKES A WHILE SO IT WAS REALLY

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:54.409
IN RECOGNITION OF THAT WE HAD

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:57.312
THIS PAUSE SO LET'S GIVE THIS

01:16:57.379 --> 01:16:58.981
THING THE CHANCE TO REALLY WORK

01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:01.616
AND THEN IT SUNSETS. AND IF WE

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.719
FEEL THAT IT DIDN'T WORK WE CAN

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:06.621
NEVER BRING IT BACK. OR AS YOU

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:08.523
SUGGESTED IF THERE ARE SOME

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:10.959
SERIOUS ISSUES WE CANNOT JUST

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:13.395
MIDSTREAM BUT SO FAR IN YOUR

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:14.429
RIGHT THERE HASN'T BEEN THE

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:15.897
WHOLE FIVE YEARS FOR IT TO

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:19.534
APPLY BUT SO FAR. THE MAIN

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:21.169
ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP OR

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:22.537
WORSEN THINGS AROUND THE

01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:25.307
DEFINITIONS AND WE INCORPORATED

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:26.441
THOSE IN THE TECHNICAL

01:17:26.508 --> 01:17:28.176
CLARIFICATIONS AND WE GOT THOSE

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:29.177
DIRECTLY FROM LOCAL

01:17:29.244 --> 01:17:31.146
GOVERNMENTS. SO WE HAVE

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:33.648
ADDRESSED THE CONCERNS THAT

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:46.855
OBVIOUS MENTION. MISMATCH ON

COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY I ALSO

THOUGHT THAT THE INITIAL TIME

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:16.451
FRAME WAS TOO SHORT I THINK WE

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:18.520
ALL COULD WISH THAT THE HOUSING

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:19.421
CRISIS WOULD BE OVER IN A

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:20.989
COUPLE YEARS- BUT I THINK WE

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:22.224
ALL KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:25.227

STATE AND I THINK IT'S

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:31.333
IMPORTANT THAT WE SET THE RULES

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:32.501

THIS CONTRARY TO. MANY OF THE

01:47:50.897 --> 01:47:52.966
SUGGESTIONS- FROM SOME OF THE

01:47:53.033 --> 01:47:54.768
FOLKS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC

01:47:54.835 --> 01:47:56.269

01:47:56.336 --> 01:47:58.271
IMPORTANT TOOL TO ACTUALLY

01:47:58.338 --> 01:47:59.606
CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING I

01:47:59.673 --> 01:48:00.574
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.609
IT SO IT'S A UNIQUE TOOL THAT

01:48:02.676 --> 01:48:05.111
INCENTIVIZES FOLKS TO BUILD

01:48:05.178 --> 01:48:06.913
AFFORDABLE HOUSING- TO

AFFORDABLE HOUSING- IN THE WAYS

01:48:10.584 --> 01:48:11.751
THAT IT'S BEEN STRUCTURED SO

01:48:11.818 --> 01:48:12.786
THAT REALLY IS THE GOAL OF

01:48:12.853 --> 01:48:15.488
THIS- SO I HAVE TO MATT I WAS A

01:48:15.555 --> 01:48:16.790
LITTLE CONFUSED BY SOME OF THE

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:18.558
COMMENTS- BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS

01:48:18.625 --> 01:48:20.727
IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THAT- LET

01:48:20.794 --> 01:48:23.096
ME ASK IF THERE ANY OTHER

01:48:23.163 --> 01:48:26.233
COMMENTS MISS CORK SILVA. YES I

01:48:26.299 --> 01:48:27.667
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:48:27.734 --> 01:48:29.603
WORKING IN THE SPACE RELATED TO

01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:31.972
HOUSING- THERE IS QUITE A BIT

01:48:32.038 --> 01:48:34.140
OF CONCERN AS WE HEARD ON THE

01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:36.276
LINES BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IN

01:48:36.343 --> 01:48:38.311
CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:48:38.378 --> 01:48:40.513
HOUSING AS A WHOLE AND WE LOOK

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:42.382
AT WHETHER IT'S MARKET RATE

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:44.985
WHETHER IT'S AFFORDABLE. AND

01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:47.187
EVEN WITH THE HOMELESS CRISIS

01:48:47.254 --> 01:48:49.222
SHELTERS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:48:49.289 --> 01:48:51.958
WE KNOW FOR SURE. IS THAT WE'RE

01:48:52.025 --> 01:48:53.860
NOT BUILDING ENOUGH. WE HAVE

01:48:53.927 --> 01:48:56.196
PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS. ARE ON

01:48:56.263 --> 01:48:57.364
ALMOST EVERY CORNER IN

01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:58.798
SACRAMENTO BUT THROUGHOUT OUR

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:01.434
STATE. BUT THIS ALSO ADDRESSES

01:49:01.501 --> 01:49:04.170
STUDENT HOUSING AND MORE AND

01:49:04.237 --> 01:49:05.772
MORE WE'RE SEEING EVEN IN OUR

01:49:05.839 --> 01:49:07.507
COMMUNITY COLLEGES I REPRESENT

FULLER TEN COLLEGE. IN MY CITY

01:49:12.646 --> 01:49:14.247
THAT I LIVE IN THIRTY FIVE

01:49:14.314 --> 01:49:15.448
THOUSAND STUDENTS CYPRESS

01:49:15.515 --> 01:49:18.184
COLLEGE. AND THE PRESIDENTS OF

01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:19.452
THOSE COLLEGES HAVE BEEN

01:49:19.519 --> 01:49:21.521
ASKING. US FOR QUITE A LONG

01:49:21.588 --> 01:49:23.089
TIME FOR US TO START TO

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:25.659
ADDRESS.UP COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:49:25.725 --> 01:49:27.260
WE THINK ABOUT FOUR YEAR

01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:30.497
COLLEGES R. C. ISSUES ARE UC'S

01:49:30.563 --> 01:49:31.631
AND MANY TIMES THEY HAVE

01:49:31.698 --> 01:49:34.034
HOUSING ON CAMPUS. MANY TIMES

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:34.935
THEY WORK FOR PRIVATE

01:49:35.001 --> 01:49:36.870
DEVELOPERS. BUT OUR COMMUNITY

01:49:36.937 --> 01:49:38.438
COLLEGES THE STUDENTS ARE MANY

01:49:38.505 --> 01:49:39.539
TIMES ARE LEFT OUT OF THESE

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:42.542
EQUATIONS- MANY TIMES WE ASSUME

01:49:42.609 --> 01:49:44.277
THAT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:49:44.344 --> 01:49:45.845
STUDENTS OR JUST GOING TO

01:49:45.912 --> 01:49:48.181
REMAIN LIVING AT HOME. AND AS

01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:50.483
WE'VE SEEN THAT IS NOT ALWAYS A

01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:51.851
POSSIBILITY OUR COMMUNITY

01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:53.586
COLLEGES STUDENTS HAVE BEEN HIT

01:49:53.653 --> 01:49:55.789
EXTREMELY HARD THIS YEAR WITH

01:49:55.855 --> 01:49:57.624
ENROLLMENT ACTUALLY WAY DOWN.

01:49:57.691 --> 01:49:59.492
PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE

01:49:59.559 --> 01:50:01.561
THEY HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK.

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:02.529
BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES HAVE

01:50:02.595 --> 01:50:05.532
LOST JOBS SO THIS BILL I THINK

01:50:05.598 --> 01:50:07.534
CAN AND WILL ADDRESS SOME OF

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.971
THIS HOUSING THAT WE SO

01:50:11.037 --> 01:50:11.738
DESPERATELY NEED THANK YOU.

01:50:11.805 --> 01:50:14.274
THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS.

01:50:14.341 --> 01:50:14.808
BACK TO THE CENTER FOR ANY

01:50:14.874 --> 01:50:17.310
FINAL WORDS. THANK YOU CHAIR

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:19.479
AND- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THOSE

01:50:19.546 --> 01:50:21.614
WHO WERE CALLING IN JUST NEVER

01:50:21.681 --> 01:50:23.583
EVEN SUPPORTED THE ORIGINAL

01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:24.718
CALIFORNIA'S ORIGINAL DENSITY

01:50:24.784 --> 01:50:26.753
BONUS BILL. I WOULD SAY THAT

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:27.721
THEIR COMMENTS REGARDING THIS

01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:30.090
BILL WOULD REFLECT NOT A

01:50:30.156 --> 01:50:31.224
CAREFUL READ BECAUSE THE

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:33.226
SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT THE

01:50:33.293 --> 01:50:35.128
REALLY SIGNIFICANT FEATURE OF

01:50:35.195 --> 01:50:37.831
THIS BILL IS TO ALLOW. STUDENT

01:50:37.897 --> 01:50:39.332
HOUSING TO BENEFIT FROM THE

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:40.967
EXISTING LAW AND THE ONLY

01:50:41.034 --> 01:50:42.202
REASON STUDENT HOUSING COULDN'T

01:50:42.268 --> 01:50:43.837
BENEFIT IN THE PAST IS BECAUSE

01:50:43.903 --> 01:50:45.472
STUDENT HOUSING IS CONFIGURED

01:50:45.538 --> 01:50:48.508
DIFFERENTLY AND OUR LAW OUR

01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:54.881
REGIONAL ALWAYS BASED ON-

01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:57.550
SOMETHING WITH A KITCHEN. AND

01:50:57.617 --> 01:51:01.087
YOU KNOW EITHER STUDIO OR OR-

01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:02.222
ONE OR TWO BEDROOM OR WHATEVER

01:51:02.288 --> 01:51:04.057
BUT IT HAD TO HAVE A DISTINCT

01:51:04.124 --> 01:51:06.259
KITCHEN. AND OF COURSE WE KNOW

01:51:06.326 --> 01:51:07.794
THAT STUDENT HOUSING IS OFTEN

01:51:07.861 --> 01:51:09.129
CONFIGURED WHERE THERE IS A

01:51:09.195 --> 01:51:11.131
COMMON KITCHEN FOR MULTIPLE

01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:13.767
FLOORS OR KITCHEN PER FLOOR.

01:51:13.833 --> 01:51:15.902
AND THAT THE UNITS ARE REALLY

01:51:15.969 --> 01:51:17.871
MORE LIKE STUDIOS BUT WITHOUT A

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:20.440
KITCHEN AND SO THIS BILL JUST

01:51:20.507 --> 01:51:22.842
ALLOWS FOR WHAT WE KNOW IS THE

01:51:22.909 --> 01:51:23.810
CONFIGURATION OF STUDENT

01:51:23.877 --> 01:51:25.912
HOUSING. TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT

01:51:25.979 --> 01:51:27.881
FROM DENSITY BONUS AND IF THEY

01:51:27.947 --> 01:51:30.250
IF THE PROJECT IS DEDICATING A

01:51:30.316 --> 01:51:33.720
CERTAIN PERCENT OF THE UNITS.

01:51:33.787 --> 01:51:36.523
OF IN THAT PROJECT FOR LOW

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:38.391
INCOME STUDENTS FOR LOW IT YOU

01:51:38.458 --> 01:51:39.092
KNOW MOVED PERMANENTLY

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:40.460
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEN IT

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:41.394
WOULD BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM

01:51:41.461 --> 01:51:42.862
THE DENSITY BONUS LAW SO IT'S

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:45.398
REALLY IT'S KEY FEATURE AND

01:51:45.465 --> 01:51:47.033
WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:47.934

NEIGHBORHOODS FROM SPECULATION.

01:54:38.972 --> 01:54:41.241
AND GENTRIFICATION AND IT COULD

01:54:41.307 --> 01:54:43.076
OPEN UP THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL

UNITS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:54:45.311 --> 01:54:46.246
AND I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO

01:54:46.312 --> 01:54:47.714
INTO THAT MISTER CHAIR. IF YOU

01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:49.582
DON'T MIND. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:54:49.649 --> 01:54:52.285
COULD DEED RESTRICT THESE UNITS

01:54:52.352 --> 01:54:54.053
TO ENSURE THEIR AFFORDABILITY.

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:54.821
I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:54:54.887 --> 01:54:56.656
DISCUSSION ABOUT. AFFORDABILITY

01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:57.924
IN THIS BILL BUT LOCAL

01:54:57.991 --> 01:54:59.659
GOVERNMENTS UNDER THIS BILL

DUPLEXES ON FOUR PLEXUS AT THAT

01:55:04.597 --> 01:55:06.466
WOULD BE TRANSITIONED- IN THEIR

01:55:06.532 --> 01:55:08.134
COMMUNITIES. THAT WOULD MEAN

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:09.902
CITIES AND COUNTIES COULD COUNT

01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:11.371
THESE UNITS AT TOWARDS THEIR

01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:13.206
NEXT AFFORDABLE HOUSING CYCLE

OVER THE NEXT DECADE. MISTER

01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:16.409
CHAIR THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

01:55:16.476 --> 01:55:18.378
WHY HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AS

01:55:18.444 --> 01:55:19.946
WELL AS BRIDGE HOUSING ONE OF

01:55:20.013 --> 01:55:21.180
THE LARGEST AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:55:21.247 --> 01:55:22.782
DEVELOPERS. IN THE STATE

01:55:22.849 --> 01:55:24.851
SUPPORT SB NINE. NOW THERE'D

01:55:24.917 --> 01:55:27.220
BEEN SOME STUDIES ON- EIGHTY

01:55:27.287 --> 01:55:29.155
USER LIKE TO DISCUSS BECAUSE-

01:55:29.222 --> 01:55:30.823
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS ARE

01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:31.858
ALMOST THE EQUIVALENT TWO

01:55:31.924 --> 01:55:33.026
DUPLEXES. I'D LIKE TO FIRST

01:55:33.092 --> 01:55:34.394
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SAME DISCO

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:35.762
BAY AREA AND LOOK AT SEVEN

01:55:35.828 --> 01:55:38.164
CALIFORNIA. SO THERE IS A STUDY

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:39.766
ON THE AVERAGE RENTAL PRICE OF

01:55:39.832 --> 01:55:41.267
AN EIGHTY YOU IN THE EAST BAY

01:55:41.334 --> 01:55:43.269
IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA.

01:55:43.336 --> 01:55:44.604
AND WHAT THAT STUDY SHOWED IS

01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:47.040
THAT EASY TO USE ARE AFFORDABLE

01:55:47.106 --> 01:55:48.675
HAVE AFFORDABLE RENTS TO

01:55:48.741 --> 01:55:51.244
SOMEONE MAKING 62% OF THE AREA

01:55:51.311 --> 01:55:53.246
MEDIAN INCOME. NOW WHY IS THAT

01:55:53.313 --> 01:55:55.248
CRITICAL WELL RIGHT NOW UNDER

01:55:55.315 --> 01:55:56.316
OUR STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE

01:55:56.382 --> 01:55:57.550
PROGRAM WITH THE ADDICTION NOR

01:55:57.617 --> 01:55:59.786
MORATORIUM. WE PROVIDE RENTAL

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:03.623
MEDIAN INCOME FOR TENANTS

01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:05.925
LIVING IN HOMES. AND IF WE LOOK

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:07.860
AT SOMETHING CALIFORNIA IN THE

01:56:07.927 --> 01:56:10.196
AFFORDABILITY. IN L. A. COUNTY

01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:14.701
RIGHT NOW SIXTY FIVE PERCENT.

01:56:14.767 --> 01:56:16.069
TWO THIRDS OF ALL ALL. USE IN

01:56:16.135 --> 01:56:18.037
THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES.

COULD BE RENTED BY A RESIDENT

01:56:20.573 --> 01:56:21.040
WHO IS IN THE LOWER INCOME

01:56:21.107 --> 01:56:24.944
CATEGORY. TWO THIRDS IF WE LOOK

01:56:25.011 --> 01:56:28.247
AT ORANGE COUNTY IT 68% OF ALL

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:30.316
EXCESSIVELY DWELLING UNITS IN

01:56:30.383 --> 01:56:32.118
IN THIS BUDGET THERE'S A

01:56:32.185 --> 01:56:34.153
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I TO BE

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:35.755
ABLE TO HELP FINANCING OF

01:56:35.822 --> 01:56:38.491
ADDITIONAL EIGHTY USE THIS BILL

01:56:38.558 --> 01:56:40.893
ALSO FOCUSES ON STRONG TENANT

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:43.196
PROTECTIONS- YOU CAN'T TURN TO

01:56:43.262 --> 01:56:45.031
TRANSITION A SINGLE FAMILY

01:56:45.098 --> 01:56:47.500
HOUSE TO A DUPLEX IF A TENANT

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:49.702
HAS LIVED IN THE DWELLING FOR

01:56:49.769 --> 01:56:51.337
THREE YEARS YOU CAN'T EVEN DO A

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:53.906
LOT SPLIT- IF A TENANT HAS

01:56:53.973 --> 01:56:56.175
LIVED IN THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME

01:56:56.242 --> 01:56:57.577
FOR THREE YEARS. INCREDIBLY

01:56:57.643 --> 01:56:59.112
STRONG TENANT PROTECTIONS

01:56:59.178 --> 01:57:00.480
LOADED INTO THIS BILL IT'S BEEN

01:57:00.546 --> 01:57:03.182
A PRIORITY FOR ME SACKINGS NO

01:57:03.249 --> 01:57:05.451
ONE MODIFICATION IS THAT THIS

01:57:05.518 --> 01:57:07.353
BILL COMPARED TO LAST YEAR

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:08.921
PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE

01:57:08.988 --> 01:57:10.490
AUTHORITY TO ENACT AN OWNER

01:57:10.556 --> 01:57:12.859
OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS THAT'S

01:57:12.925 --> 01:57:15.027
BEEN A VERY CLEAR AND LOUD-

01:57:15.094 --> 01:57:16.062
PIECE OF FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE

01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:17.764
HEARD FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS-

01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:19.365
SO THERE IS AN ABILITY FOR

01:57:19.432 --> 01:57:20.900
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO

01:57:20.967 --> 01:57:23.369
ENACT A OWNER OCCUPANCY

01:57:23.436 --> 01:57:24.837
REQUIREMENTS ANOTHER AMENDMENT

01:57:24.904 --> 01:57:26.572
MADE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE

01:57:26.639 --> 01:57:27.607
NUMBER OF UNITS ARE ALLOWED ON

01:57:27.673 --> 01:57:31.511
THE LOT. IS FOR IN ONLY FOUR.

01:57:31.577 --> 01:57:32.712
SO THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION

01:57:32.779 --> 01:57:34.480
THAT YOU COULD BUILD FIVE YOU

01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:35.882
CAN BUILD SIX YOU COULD BILL

01:57:35.948 --> 01:57:38.084
TEN. UNDER THIS BILL. THAT'S

01:57:38.151 --> 01:57:40.153
ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE ENCOURAGE

01:57:40.219 --> 01:57:42.155
FOLKS TO LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE

01:57:42.221 --> 01:57:44.857
YOU CAN BUILD FOR IN ONLY UP TO

01:57:44.924 --> 01:57:47.794
FOUR. YOU CAN'T DOUBLE DIP. IF

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:50.096
A HOMEOWNER HAS A SINGLE FAMILY

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:52.565
HOME A. G. EIGHTY YOU AND IN

01:57:52.632 --> 01:57:54.133
EIGHTY YOU ON A LOT NOW YOU

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:55.935
CAN'T GO BUILD ANOTHER FOUR

01:57:56.002 --> 01:57:57.970
UNITS. IT'S CLEAR IN THIS BILL.

01:57:58.037 --> 01:58:00.373
IN THIS BILL IS ALSO OPTIONAL

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:02.041
IT DOESN'T FORCE HOMEOWNERS TO

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:02.975
DO ANYTHING IT'S AT THEIR OWN

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:05.278
DISCRETION. THIS MERELY OFFERS

01:58:05.344 --> 01:58:06.813
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HOMEOWNERS

01:58:06.879 --> 01:58:08.948
TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE WORKFORCE

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:10.950
HOUSING THAT WE ALL TALK ABOUT

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:12.819
EACH AND EVERY DAY THAT EACH OF

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:14.220
OUR COMMUNITIES IN BIG CITIES

01:58:14.287 --> 01:58:16.289
AND SMALL SO DESPERATELY NEED.

01:58:16.355 --> 01:58:17.690
AND I'D SAY TO THOSE WHO MAY

01:58:17.757 --> 01:58:18.891
ARGUE THAT THIS COULD

01:58:18.958 --> 01:58:19.959
JEOPARDIZE THE LOOK OF THEIR

01:58:20.026 --> 01:58:21.627
NEIGHBORHOOD. I THINK WE SHOULD

01:58:21.694 --> 01:58:22.361
LOOK AROUND US IN OUR

01:58:22.428 --> 01:58:24.464
COMMUNITIES THERE ALREADY ARE

01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:26.466
BEAUTIFUL DUPLEXES- IN EXCESS

01:58:26.532 --> 01:58:28.301
OF THE DWELLING UNITS NEXT DOOR

01:58:28.367 --> 01:58:29.869
TO TRADITIONAL SINGLE FAMILY

01:58:29.936 --> 01:58:31.037
HOMES IN SOME OF OUR STATE'S

01:58:31.103 --> 01:58:33.606
MOST SOUGHT AFTER ZIP CODES.

01:58:33.673 --> 01:58:34.941
EITHER CHARMING HOUSES THAT ARE

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:36.542
NOT ONLY A BRIGHT SPOT ON THE

01:58:36.609 --> 01:58:38.377
BLOCK BUT A COMFORTABLE PLACE

01:58:38.444 --> 01:58:40.046
FOR NOT JUST ONE. BUT TWO

01:58:40.112 --> 01:58:42.148
FAMILIES TO CALL HOME. ALONG

01:58:42.215 --> 01:58:43.583
WITH SAFEGUARDS IN THE PRO OUT

01:58:43.649 --> 01:58:45.485
OF THE PROTEINS BILL AND I TO

01:58:45.551 --> 01:58:46.519
QUICKLY DISCUSS THE OPPORTUNITY

01:58:46.586 --> 01:58:48.621
PROVIDES FOR FAMILIES TO HAVE

01:58:48.688 --> 01:58:49.989
MORE OPTIONS TO BUILD MULTI

01:58:50.056 --> 01:58:51.924
GENERATIONAL HOUSING. AND BUILD

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:53.860
MULTI GENERATIONAL WEALTH.

01:58:53.926 --> 01:58:54.694
INTERJECTION G.

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:55.995
INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH IS A

01:58:56.062 --> 01:58:58.130
CURRENCY WE ALL KNOW- THAT IS

01:58:58.197 --> 01:58:59.765
CRUCIAL TO COUNTERING THE

01:58:59.832 --> 01:59:02.235
INEQUITY- IN CREATING SOCIAL

01:59:02.301 --> 01:59:04.003
MOBILITY. AND WHAT WE ALSO KNOW

01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:06.272
IS A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IS A

01:59:06.339 --> 01:59:07.073
CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER ONE

01:59:07.139 --> 01:59:09.375
MISTAKE. AND NOW THIS IS A

01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:10.309
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN

01:59:10.376 --> 01:59:12.111
NEIGHBORHOODS WERE OUTDATED

01:59:12.178 --> 01:59:13.679
ZONING LAWS HAVE CREATED

01:59:13.746 --> 01:59:14.647
BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE

WE ARE HERE RE LITIGATING. A

02:45:22.379 --> 02:45:24.047
VERY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE.

02:45:24.114 --> 02:45:25.615
GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THAT

02:45:25.682 --> 02:45:27.617
DERELICTION AND DYSFUNCTION OF

I'LL SAY ON A WHEN IT COMES

THAT LATE IN THE GAME ON A

02:45:42.799 --> 02:45:44.167
MAJOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT

02:45:44.234 --> 02:45:45.302
DOESN'T REALLY SUGGEST TO ME A

02:45:45.368 --> 02:45:47.437
GENUINE DESIRE. TO COLLABORATE

02:45:47.504 --> 02:45:49.472
ON POLICY AS A POINT OF

02:45:49.539 --> 02:45:50.540
CONTRAST THE SENATOR FROM SAN

02:45:50.607 --> 02:45:52.242

02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:53.076
WELL OVER A WEEK BEFORE THIS

02:45:53.143 --> 02:45:54.577
HEARING WE'VE HAD LENGTHY

02:45:54.644 --> 02:45:56.079
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HIS BILL AND

02:45:56.146 --> 02:45:56.913
I WAS ABLE TO GIVE HIM A GOOD

02:45:56.980 --> 02:45:58.982
SENSE. OF WHERE I STAND ON EACH

02:45:59.049 --> 02:46:01.318
OF HIS THREE BILLS ACTUALLY-

02:46:01.384 --> 02:46:03.720
PRIOR TO THIS HEARING. TURNING

02:46:03.787 --> 02:46:05.588
TO THE YOU KNOW THE MERITS OF

02:46:05.655 --> 02:46:08.124
THE LEGISLATION. I HAVE SINCE

02:46:08.191 --> 02:46:10.193
I'VE BEEN HERE IN. OVER THE

02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:12.062
LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS I

02:46:12.128 --> 02:46:15.365
SUPPORTED. EVERY BILL THAT I

02:46:15.432 --> 02:46:19.002
COULD THAT THAT I'VE SEEN- THAT.

02:46:19.069 --> 02:46:21.371
I BELIEVE IT WOULD CREATE AN

02:46:21.438 --> 02:46:22.906
ADVANTAGE EXPAND OUR HOUSING

02:46:22.972 --> 02:46:25.542

02:46:25.608 --> 02:46:27.777
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THAT'S EVEN

02:46:27.844 --> 02:46:29.079
BEEN INTENTION WAS SOME OF THE

02:46:29.145 --> 02:46:31.047
OTHER VALUES THAT GUIDE BY

02:46:31.114 --> 02:46:33.249
POLICY MAKING BUT I THINK THAT

02:46:33.316 --> 02:46:34.551
THE ISSUE IS THAT IMPORTANT

02:46:34.617 --> 02:46:35.952
IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST

02:46:36.019 --> 02:46:37.921
IMPORTANT ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:46:37.987 --> 02:46:38.588
WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUALITY OF

02:46:38.655 --> 02:46:40.690
LIFE HERE WHEN IT COMES. TO OUR

02:46:40.757 --> 02:46:42.559
STATE'S FUTURE AND YET WE HAVE

02:46:42.625 --> 02:46:44.994
SEEN NO IMPROVEMENT THE PROBLEM

02:46:45.061 --> 02:46:46.096
HAS GOTTEN WORSE THE LAST TWO

02:46:46.162 --> 02:46:48.832
YEARS THE NUMBER OF PERMITS HAS

02:46:48.898 --> 02:46:51.501
DECLINED BURKE WE'RE BUILDING A

02:46:51.568 --> 02:46:53.870
VERY VERY SMALL FRACTION OF

02:46:53.937 --> 02:46:55.772
WHAT WE ULTIMATELY NEED. AND IF

02:46:55.839 --> 02:46:57.474
THERE WERE REAL POLITICAL

02:46:57.540 --> 02:46:58.808
LEADERSHIP IN THIS STATE AND WE

02:46:58.875 --> 02:47:00.744
WOULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IN A

02:47:00.810 --> 02:47:02.112
WAY THAT IS URGENT IN A WAY

02:47:02.178 --> 02:47:03.680
THAT IS COMPREHENSIVE WE HAVE A

02:47:03.747 --> 02:47:04.481
SPECIAL SESSION OF THE

02:47:04.547 --> 02:47:06.750

02:47:06.816 --> 02:47:08.518
WHAT TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT

02:47:14.924 --> 02:47:16.826

WOULD BE ABLE TO AGREE ON. BUT

02:47:24.401 --> 02:47:25.969
WE'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT

02:47:26.035 --> 02:47:28.538
INSTEAD OF THE ONE LEVER THAT

02:47:28.605 --> 02:47:30.206
WE'VE BEEN WILLING TO TRY TO

02:47:30.273 --> 02:47:32.776

POWERFUL INTERESTS THAT HAVE. A

02:47:54.130 --> 02:47:55.665
LOT OF PULL ON BOTH SIDES OF

02:47:55.732 --> 02:47:57.667
THE AISLE FRANKLY- AND ON THE

02:47:57.734 --> 02:47:59.736
OTHER SIDE AND THAT'S ENOUGH

02:47:59.803 --> 02:48:00.904
THERE'S ENOUGH OLITICAL MUSCLE

02:48:00.970 --> 02:48:02.806
TO OVERCOME THIS STRONG

02:48:02.872 --> 02:48:04.407
OPPOSITION AND QUITE LEGITIMATE

02:48:04.474 --> 02:48:06.443
OPPOSITION IN SOME CASES- OF

LOCAL GOVERNMENT- AND SO

02:48:09.112 --> 02:48:11.214
BECAUSE IT'S SACRAMENTO.

02:48:11.281 --> 02:48:13.383
INTEREST ON ONE SIDE AND JUST

02:48:13.450 --> 02:48:15.151

ORDER SHOULD PRESS ANY OF THE

02:48:20.056 --> 02:48:21.558
PARTS OF THE HOUSING PROBLEM.

02:48:21.624 --> 02:48:22.459
SUDDENLY THEN YOU HAVE

02:48:22.525 --> 02:48:23.827

THE OPPOSITION SIDE AND SO

02:48:29.132 --> 02:48:29.766
WE'RE NOT WILLING TO FIGHT

02:48:29.833 --> 02:48:31.501
THOSE BATTLES. AND SO I'VE

02:48:31.568 --> 02:48:33.036
SUPPORTED MEASURES LIKE THIS

02:48:33.102 --> 02:48:33.970

WE LOOK LIKE WE'RE DOING

02:48:40.477 --> 02:48:41.811
SOMETHING TO ADDRESS HOUSING

02:48:41.878 --> 02:48:44.314

BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. WE HAVE TO

02:53:56.759 --> 02:53:59.262
BUILD HOUSING. IT TOOK

02:53:59.328 --> 02:54:02.965
EVERYTHING THAT I HAD. PLUS MY

02:54:03.032 --> 02:54:04.867
WIFE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE

02:54:04.934 --> 02:54:06.769
COMMUNITY THAT I GREW UP IN MY

02:54:06.836 --> 02:54:08.304
FAMILY'S BEEN IN FOR THREE

02:54:08.371 --> 02:54:11.874
GENERATIONS ON THE FOURTH. AND

02:54:11.941 --> 02:54:13.976
WE HAVE TO FOCUS EVEN THOUGH

02:54:14.043 --> 02:54:16.445
HOUSING BILLS ARE HARD WE HAVE

02:54:16.512 --> 02:54:17.313
TO FOCUS ON MOVING FORWARD AND

02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:19.382
I'M SORRY. AT MENACINGLY BY ONE

02:54:19.448 --> 02:54:20.983
ON FOR SO LONG BUT- HOPEFULLY

02:54:21.050 --> 02:54:22.051
THAT ANSWERED THE QUESTION IN

02:54:22.118 --> 02:54:25.555
REGARDS TO TWELVE AND ARCHITECT.

02:54:25.621 --> 02:54:27.190
I APPRECIATE THAT A SENATOR

02:54:27.256 --> 02:54:29.292
REQUIRE- YOU THE OTHER ISSUE I

02:54:29.358 --> 02:54:30.827
JUST WANTED TO ALSO COMMENT ON

02:54:30.893 --> 02:54:32.128
AS IT WAS RAISED BY OPPOSITION

02:54:32.195 --> 02:54:33.196
A COUPLE TIMES AT THIS BILL HAS

02:54:33.262 --> 02:54:34.363
NO. AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:54:34.430 --> 02:54:35.965
REQUIREMENTS TO IT I WANT TO

02:54:36.032 --> 02:54:36.999
POINT OUT THAT THE CURRENT

02:54:37.066 --> 02:54:38.234
STATUS QUO OF SINGLE FAMILY

02:54:38.301 --> 02:54:40.102
ZONING HAS NO AFFORDABILITY

02:54:40.169 --> 02:54:41.804
REQUIREMENTS TO IT. AND A

02:54:41.871 --> 02:54:43.639
SINGLE FAMILY ZONING IS ROOTED

02:54:43.706 --> 02:54:45.174
IN REDLINING AND IT IS CREATED

02:54:45.241 --> 02:54:49.111
HUGE PROBLEMS AND- YOU KNOW IT

02:54:49.178 --> 02:54:51.013
RESULTS IN. A EXCLUSIONARY

02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:52.982
HOUSING AND AT LEAST THIS BILL

02:54:53.049 --> 02:54:54.483
THESE UNITS CAN BE A DEED

02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:55.151
RESTRICTED SHOULD LOCAL

02:54:55.218 --> 02:54:56.619
GOVERNMENTS DECIDE WHICH I

02:54:56.686 --> 02:54:57.954
THINK IS AN IMPORTANT STEP

02:54:58.020 --> 02:54:58.921
FORWARD I THINK THIS BILL WILL

02:54:58.988 --> 02:55:01.057
CREATE MORE. HOUSING WHICH WE

02:55:01.123 --> 02:55:01.791
OBVIOUSLY NEED IT NEEDS YOU

02:55:01.858 --> 02:55:04.026
SAID- INCREASE DENSITY IN A WAY

02:55:04.093 --> 02:55:04.961
THAT I THINK DOESN'T

02:55:05.027 --> 02:55:05.828
FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE

02:55:05.895 --> 02:55:07.129
CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD

02:55:07.196 --> 02:55:07.997
WHICH I KNOW WAS IMPORTANT FOR

02:55:08.064 --> 02:55:09.765
SOME PEOPLE. IT GIVES LOCAL

02:55:09.832 --> 02:55:10.933
GOVERNMENT THE ABILITY AS YOU

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:12.134
SAID TO PREVENT BUILDING AND

02:55:12.201 --> 02:55:13.202
HIGH FIRE SOUNDS WHICH IS

02:55:13.269 --> 02:55:14.337
IMPORTANT FOR PARTS OF MY

02:55:14.403 --> 02:55:15.605
DISTRICT BERKELEY OAKLAND AREA

02:55:15.671 --> 02:55:16.906
WE HAD A FIRE THEIR NINETEEN

02:55:16.973 --> 02:55:18.975
NINETY TWO- THIS BILL IS

02:55:19.041 --> 02:55:21.344
OPTIONAL IT ALLOWS. HOMEOWNERS

02:55:21.410 --> 02:55:22.945
TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUILD

02:55:23.012 --> 02:55:24.347
SMALLER UNIT SHOULD THEY CHOOSE

02:55:24.413 --> 02:55:26.282
TO- AND I THINK IT SUCKS AND I

02:55:26.349 --> 02:55:28.017
WAS A BIG SUPPORTER OF SB

02:55:28.084 --> 02:55:28.584
ELEVEN TWENTY AT THE END OF

02:55:28.651 --> 02:55:29.485
SESSION LAST YEAR I SPOKE ON

02:55:29.552 --> 02:55:30.820
THE BILL IN THE WEE HOURS OF

02:55:30.887 --> 02:55:32.655
THE DAY. I REMAIN COMMITTED TO

02:55:32.722 --> 02:55:34.190
SUPPORTING THIS BILL I THINK WE

02:55:34.257 --> 02:55:35.791
NEED TO LEGALIZE DUPLEXES WE

02:55:35.858 --> 02:55:37.260
NEED TO CREATE MORE HOUSING WE

02:55:37.326 --> 02:55:38.361
NEED TO BE A MORE INCLUSIVE

02:55:38.427 --> 02:55:39.762
STATE. AND HAVE OUR HOUSING

02:55:39.829 --> 02:55:41.797
POLICIES MATCH OUR PROGRESSIVE

02:55:41.864 --> 02:55:42.832
VALUES BY ENSURING THAT WE

02:55:42.899 --> 02:55:44.734
REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESS

02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:48.571
THE HOUSING SHORTAGE I'M HAPPY.

02:55:48.638 --> 02:55:49.138
TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL I

02:55:49.205 --> 02:55:49.739
WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL.

PRESENTING THIS BILL I KNOW

02:56:00.116 --> 02:56:03.986
ITS- A- DIFFICULT CONVERSATION

02:56:04.053 --> 02:56:06.622
AND- I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND

02:56:06.689 --> 02:56:08.124
IF YOU COULD I KNOW IT WAS JUST

02:56:08.190 --> 02:56:09.558
ADDRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUES

02:56:09.625 --> 02:56:14.096
HERE. BUT DOES THIS BILL- DO

02:56:14.163 --> 02:56:15.898
ANYTHING REGARDING AFFORDABLE

02:56:15.965 --> 02:56:18.834

IN MY DISTRICT RECEIVED

02:56:22.571 --> 02:56:24.874
MAILERS- SENT OUT SAYING THIS

02:56:24.941 --> 02:56:26.676
BILL DOES NOTHING TO CREATE

02:56:26.742 --> 02:56:29.045
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THANK YOU SO

02:56:29.111 --> 02:56:30.980
MUCH- SOME NUMBER AND I'M

02:56:31.047 --> 02:56:31.480
REALLY GRATEFUL THAT YOU

02:56:31.547 --> 02:56:34.550
BROUGHT THAT UP. SO PUTTING A

02:56:34.617 --> 02:56:36.118
HEADLINE ON THE MAILER IS ONE

02:56:36.185 --> 02:56:39.488
ISSUE. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR

02:56:39.555 --> 02:56:41.824
DECISION BASED OFF OF DATA SO

02:56:41.891 --> 02:56:44.026
LET'S TALK ABOUT DATA TODAY. SO

02:56:44.093 --> 02:56:45.594
ACCORDING TO THE SOUTHERN

02:56:45.661 --> 02:56:46.128
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

02:56:46.195 --> 02:56:50.766
GOVERNMENTS. 65% OF ALL EIGHTY

02:56:50.833 --> 02:56:51.400
USE THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT IN THE

02:56:51.467 --> 02:56:53.269
COUNTY OF LA- PROVIDE

02:56:53.336 --> 02:56:55.905
AFFORDABLE RANGE. FOR FAMILIES

02:56:55.972 --> 02:56:57.673
THAT WOULD FALL INTO THE LOW

02:56:57.740 --> 02:56:59.041
INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:56:59.108 --> 02:57:01.944
CATEGORY. SO YOU HAVE VERY LOW

02:57:02.011 --> 02:57:05.281
LOW AND MODERATE- 65% OF ALL

02:57:05.348 --> 02:57:06.949
EIGHTY USE WOULD FALL INTO THAT

02:57:07.016 --> 02:57:10.119
AFFORDABLE HOUSING CATEGORY 68%

02:57:10.186 --> 02:57:11.220
OF ALL EIGHTY USE IN ORANGE

02:57:11.287 --> 02:57:13.289
COUNTY AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILY

02:57:13.356 --> 02:57:14.690
THAT FALLS INTO THAT LOW INCOME

02:57:14.757 --> 02:57:16.559
CREDIT CATEGORY CAN AFFORD THE

02:57:16.625 --> 02:57:18.394
AVERAGE RATE OF EIGHTY YOU. THE

02:57:18.461 --> 02:57:20.262
REASON WHY I BRING THAT UP BUT

02:57:20.329 --> 02:57:23.499
THESE DUPLEXES ARE VERY SIMILAR

02:57:23.566 --> 02:57:26.335
SIZES TO EIGHTY USE. SO THE

02:57:26.402 --> 02:57:29.005
SECOND PIECE IS WE ENCOURAGE

02:57:29.071 --> 02:57:30.306
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PUT DEED

02:57:30.373 --> 02:57:31.574
RESTRICTIONS UNDER THESE

02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:34.577
DUPLEXES. AGAIN WHAT WE REALLY

02:57:34.643 --> 02:57:36.112
TRY TO FOCUS IN ON IS AN

02:57:36.178 --> 02:57:36.645
ELEGANT APPROACH THE LOCAL

02:57:36.712 --> 02:57:40.349
CONTROL. SO IF AND IF A LOCAL

02:57:40.416 --> 02:57:43.252
GOVERNMENT WANTED TO BE ABLE TO

02:57:43.319 --> 02:57:44.787
PUT DEED RESTRICTIONS.

02:57:44.854 --> 02:57:47.089
COVENANTS ON TO EACH OF THESE

02:57:47.156 --> 02:57:50.626
DUPLEXES THEY COULD. THEY DON'T

02:57:50.693 --> 02:57:51.227
NEED THE STATE SIMPLY TO TELL

02:57:51.293 --> 02:57:54.930
THEM. CANDIDLY I WE HEARD ONE

02:57:54.997 --> 02:57:56.866
OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS TRUMP

02:57:56.932 --> 02:57:58.067
WITH THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

02:57:58.134 --> 02:57:59.602
ABOUT TO BUILD A HUNDRED AND

02:57:59.668 --> 02:58:01.871
EIGHTY EIGHTY USE. THEIR

02:58:01.937 --> 02:58:04.840
MINISTERIAL. JUST LIKE THIS

02:58:04.907 --> 02:58:08.477
BILL. SO THAT WAS VERY

02:58:08.544 --> 02:58:09.712
CONTROVERSIAL GOING TO THE

02:58:09.779 --> 02:58:10.946
LEGISLATURE BUT WE'RE LITERALLY

02:58:11.013 --> 02:58:13.082
SEEING THOUSANDS OF EIGHTY USE

02:58:13.149 --> 02:58:16.619
IN PERMIT. BEING BUILT OR BUILT

02:58:16.685 --> 02:58:18.754
THAT NOW ARE AFFORDABLE BASED

02:58:18.821 --> 02:58:20.589
OFF OF WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE

02:58:20.656 --> 02:58:21.223
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION

02:58:21.290 --> 02:58:23.059
OF GOVERNMENTS. THERE IS NO

02:58:23.125 --> 02:58:24.160
SPECIFIC AFFORDABILITY

02:58:24.226 --> 02:58:25.995
COVENANTS IN THE BILL BUT THAT

02:58:26.062 --> 02:58:28.264
DOES NOT STOP- LOCAL

02:58:28.330 --> 02:58:29.198
GOVERNMENTS FROM DOING THAT

02:58:29.265 --> 02:58:31.000
OTHERWISE THANK YOU SOME NUMBER

02:58:31.067 --> 02:58:31.901
HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS YOUR

02:58:31.967 --> 02:58:33.502
QUESTION. YES AND THEN I HAVE

02:58:33.569 --> 02:58:35.104
SOME FOLLOW UP COMMENTS GUESTS

02:58:35.171 --> 02:58:36.172
PLEASE AND AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE

02:58:36.238 --> 02:58:37.773
ON THIS COMMITTEE AND WE KIND

02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:40.443
OF SPEAK HOUSING LANGUAGE A LOT

02:58:40.509 --> 02:58:41.444
OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:43.379
A DO YOU MEAN YES AN EIGHTY YOU

02:58:43.446 --> 02:58:45.848
MEANS A AS AN ACCESSORY

02:58:45.915 --> 02:58:48.184
DWELLING UNIT ALL ARE. AN OLDER

02:58:48.250 --> 02:58:50.152
TERM WOULD BE A GRANNY FLAT OR

02:58:50.219 --> 02:58:52.188
EVEN A MOTHER IN LAW CAN WE

02:58:52.254 --> 02:58:54.590
KNOW THAT. IN THE PAST SO I

02:58:54.657 --> 02:58:55.991
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PAST THE

02:58:56.058 --> 02:58:57.193
PRESENT AND THE FUTURE OF

02:58:57.259 --> 02:58:59.829
HOUSING IN THE PAST- THERE WERE

02:58:59.895 --> 02:59:02.231
OFTEN EIGHTY USER GRANNY FLATS

02:59:02.298 --> 02:59:04.733
BUILT EXACTLY FOR WHAT IT SAYS

02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:07.903
EITHER AGING PARENTS- MOTHER

02:59:07.970 --> 02:59:09.538
LOVE WHICH IS A LITTLE.

02:59:09.605 --> 02:59:13.642
NEGATIVE BUT THOSE WERE BUILT

02:59:13.709 --> 02:59:14.276
AND THEN THEY STOPPED. AND THEY

02:59:14.343 --> 02:59:16.045
STOPPED BECAUSE THERE WERE MANY

02:59:16.112 --> 02:59:18.080
REASONS- BARRIERS FOR SINGLE

02:59:18.147 --> 02:59:20.082
FAMILY RESIDENCE WHETHER THEY'D

02:59:20.149 --> 02:59:21.784
THEY WERE A FEES FROM THE

02:59:21.851 --> 02:59:25.721
CITY'S. OF OTHER REASONS BUT

02:59:25.788 --> 02:59:27.790
EIGHTY USE ARE NOW BECOMING.

02:59:27.857 --> 02:59:29.525
ARE COMING BACKIF YOU WANT TO

02:59:29.592 --> 02:59:32.928
SAY OLD SCHOOL NEW SCHOOL. AND

02:59:32.995 --> 02:59:34.597
THERE IS NO MANDATE FOR A

02:59:34.663 --> 02:59:36.932
SINGLE FAMILY A HOMEOWNER TO

02:59:36.999 --> 02:59:38.834
CHOOSE TO DO THAT MATTER FACT

02:59:38.901 --> 02:59:40.469
UP THERE ARE AND STILL SOME

02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:42.972
BARRIERS AS FAR AS COST BUT

02:59:43.038 --> 02:59:46.509
THIS BILL- IT TALKS ABOUT. WHAT

02:59:46.575 --> 02:59:48.310
HAVE WE DONE IN THE PAST AND

02:59:48.377 --> 02:59:49.378
NOW WHAT ARE WE DOING IN THE

02:59:49.445 --> 02:59:52.248
FUTURE AND RIGHT NOW IN THE

02:59:52.314 --> 02:59:54.416
PRESENT WE SEE WE HAVE A

02:59:54.483 --> 02:59:56.285
PRODUCTION OF. CRISIS A

02:59:56.352 --> 02:59:58.320
PRODUCTION CRISIS THIS IS AN

02:59:58.387 --> 03:00:01.390
ATTEMPT TO SAY LET'S LOOK AT UP

03:00:01.457 --> 03:00:03.459
WHERE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

03:00:03.526 --> 03:00:05.828
CURRENTLY AND CAN WE LOOK

03:00:05.895 --> 03:00:09.131
TOWARDS. THE FUTURE AS FAR AS

03:00:09.198 --> 03:00:11.467
PROVIDING OTHER FORMS OF

03:00:11.534 --> 03:00:12.434
HOUSING WITHIN THE SAME

03:00:12.501 --> 03:00:15.337
NEIGHBORHOOD. I COME FROM

03:00:15.404 --> 03:00:17.973
ORANGE COUNTY TO SACRAMENTO I

03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:19.441
WALKED THROUGH SACRAMENTO AND I

03:00:19.508 --> 03:00:20.910
AM AMAZED AT SOME OF THE

03:00:20.976 --> 03:00:24.079
BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBORHOODS. HERE

03:00:24.146 --> 03:00:25.814
THAT THAT IN MANY TIMES WE'LL

03:00:25.881 --> 03:00:28.384
SEE A SINGLE FAMILY BUT THEN

03:00:28.450 --> 03:00:30.553
EIGHT DUPLEX MAYBE FOUR UNITS

03:00:30.619 --> 03:00:31.921
MAYBE EIGHT UNITS AND THEN

03:00:31.987 --> 03:00:35.558
SOMETIMES EVEN A- OF MORE A

03:00:35.624 --> 03:00:37.893
TALLER BUILDING THAT MIGHT HAVE

03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:39.962
THAT UP EVEN MORE RESIDENTS.

03:00:40.029 --> 03:00:42.298
THEY SEEM TO CO EIST UP VERY

03:00:42.364 --> 03:00:43.832
NICELY AND THESE HAVE BEEN

03:00:43.899 --> 03:00:45.434
BUILT NOT JUST IN THE LAST

03:00:45.501 --> 03:00:48.404
DECADE BUT MANY DECADES AGO SO

03:00:48.470 --> 03:00:50.139
I THINK THAT IF PEOPLE REALLY

03:00:50.206 --> 03:00:52.708
DRIVE THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND-

03:00:52.775 --> 03:00:54.543
LOOK TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN

03:00:54.610 --> 03:00:56.912
THE PAST. AND HOW WE CAN TAKE

03:00:56.979 --> 03:00:59.081
SOME CUES FROM THAT BUT THIS IS

03:00:59.148 --> 03:01:03.752
NOT THE BILL. THAT IS AS- AS

03:01:03.819 --> 03:01:05.454
PEOPLE ARE MAKING IT OUT BUT I

03:01:05.521 --> 03:01:07.623
DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TWO OR

03:01:07.690 --> 03:01:09.825
THREE THINGS. BECAUSE I HAVE

03:01:09.892 --> 03:01:12.328
RECEIVED CALLS AND OPPOSITION

03:01:12.394 --> 03:01:14.663
FROM SOME PEOPLE MY- AND MY

03:01:14.730 --> 03:01:16.398
AREA AND I KNOW THEY'RE VERY

03:01:16.465 --> 03:01:20.069
PROTECTIVE OF- THE COMMUNITIES.

03:01:20.135 --> 03:01:21.837
NOT IN THE SENSE OF OVER

03:01:21.904 --> 03:01:23.939
BUILDING BUT IN THE CHARACTER

03:01:24.006 --> 03:01:24.707
FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE

03:01:24.773 --> 03:01:25.808
NEIGHBORHOOD AND I'M VERY

03:01:25.874 --> 03:01:27.710
SENSITIVE TO THAT SO IT SAYS

03:01:27.776 --> 03:01:29.979
THE STATE OR LOCAL HISTORICAL

03:01:30.045 --> 03:01:32.248
DISTRICT. OR PROPERTY AS

03:01:32.314 --> 03:01:34.817
DEFINED MEANING THIS BILL WOULD

03:01:34.883 --> 03:01:38.954
NOT APPLY TO THAT- THIS HOW THE

03:01:39.021 --> 03:01:40.623
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WILL NOT

03:01:40.689 --> 03:01:42.057
REQUIRE DEMOLITION OR

03:01:42.124 --> 03:01:43.659
ALTERATION OF ANY OF THE

03:01:43.726 --> 03:01:45.628
FOLLOWING TYPES OF HOUSE.

03:01:45.694 --> 03:01:47.496
HOUSING AND THEN IT LISTS BUT

03:01:47.563 --> 03:01:49.398
THIS BILL IS ELEVEN PAGES LONG

03:01:49.465 --> 03:01:51.066
THAT WE HAVE HERE SO I REALLY

03:01:51.133 --> 03:01:52.801
PLEAD WITH THE PEOPLE WHO'VE

03:01:52.868 --> 03:01:55.104
CALLED TO READ IT CAREFULLY

03:01:55.170 --> 03:01:56.972
BECAUSE THE MAILERS THAT YOU

03:01:57.039 --> 03:01:58.774
RECEIVE. JUST TALK ABOUT

03:01:58.841 --> 03:02:01.477
GENTRIFICATION- AND I THINK

03:02:01.543 --> 03:02:03.312
THAT'S REALLY OF A VERY

03:02:03.379 --> 03:02:05.514
LIMITING AS FAR AS THE PEOPLE

03:02:05.581 --> 03:02:07.016
WHO PUT THOSE MAILERS OUT

03:02:07.082 --> 03:02:09.118
BECAUSE THIS SIMPLY SAYS. UP

03:02:09.184 --> 03:02:10.853
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE STOCK

03:02:10.919 --> 03:02:12.021
OF HOUSING WE HAVE IN OUR

03:02:12.087 --> 03:02:13.589
NEIGHBORHOOD LET'S GIVE SOME

03:02:13.656 --> 03:02:15.858
ZONING OPTIONS NONE OF THEM ARE

03:02:15.924 --> 03:02:18.260
MANDATES- AND LET'S MOVE

03:02:18.327 --> 03:02:19.728
FORWARD WITH BUILDING IN

03:02:19.795 --> 03:02:21.664
CALIFORNIA SO I SUPPORT THIS

03:02:21.730 --> 03:02:23.732
BILL TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR.

03:02:23.799 --> 03:02:27.136

THE PREVIOUS REGARDING THIS

03:02:38.447 --> 03:02:41.317
BILL AND SOME OF THE OTHERS. SO

03:02:41.383 --> 03:02:42.818
MY CONCERNS ARE THERE ARE SOME

03:02:42.885 --> 03:02:44.153
CONCERNS THAT I HAD THAT OTHERS

03:02:44.219 --> 03:02:46.422
EXPRESS I'M NOT GONNA REITERATE

03:02:46.488 --> 03:02:48.023
DOES IN THE INTEREST OF TIME.

03:02:48.090 --> 03:02:49.425
BUT YOU KNOW COMING FROM AN

03:02:49.491 --> 03:02:54.596
AREA- IN IN MY DISTRICT. IS AN

03:02:54.663 --> 03:02:55.531
AREA WHERE PEOPLE ARE FLEEING

03:02:55.597 --> 03:02:57.633
TO- JUST LIKE UP HERE IN THE

03:02:57.700 --> 03:02:59.134
BAY AREA IF YOU ARE FOR THE BAY

03:02:59.201 --> 03:03:00.502
AREA FOLKS ARE FLEEING TO THE

03:03:00.569 --> 03:03:02.671
OUTSKIRTS OF SACRAMENTO. AND

03:03:02.738 --> 03:03:05.174
YOU GO OUT AND YOU LOOK AT. DID

03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:07.376
THE ROSE BILLS LINCOLN'S EL

03:03:07.443 --> 03:03:09.411
DORADO HILLS FOLSOM'S. AND

03:03:09.478 --> 03:03:11.146
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE

03:03:11.213 --> 03:03:12.247
THEY'RE BUILDING A LOT OF

03:03:12.314 --> 03:03:13.415
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THEY'RE

03:03:13.482 --> 03:03:15.484
ALSO BUILDING A LOT OF MULTI

03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:17.453
FAMILY HOMES. THESE ARE ALL

03:03:17.519 --> 03:03:19.054
COMMUNITIES THAT WERE BUILT ON

03:03:19.121 --> 03:03:20.956
MASTER PLANS. THEIR MASTER

03:03:21.023 --> 03:03:22.524
PLANNED COMMUNITIES THAT WENT

03:03:22.591 --> 03:03:24.493
THROUGH A PROCESS THAT WENT

03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:26.628
THROUGH THE STATE'S PROCESS. TO

03:03:26.695 --> 03:03:28.197
EVEN BE ABLE TO BUILD WHAT THEY

03:03:28.263 --> 03:03:30.232
HAVE TO GET THEIR GENERAL PLANS

03:03:30.299 --> 03:03:31.967
APPROVED. AND WHAT THIS

03:03:32.034 --> 03:03:34.403
ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS TO HAPPEN IS

03:03:34.470 --> 03:03:36.171
A DOUBLING OF THE POPULATION

03:03:36.238 --> 03:03:38.173
VIA EVERY RESIDENTIAL BEING

03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:39.942
ELIGIBLE TAB TWO INSTEAD OF

03:03:40.008 --> 03:03:44.113
ONE. AND WITHOUT A SEQUEL IT

03:03:44.179 --> 03:03:45.814
WITHOUT THE STATE'S OWN SEQUEL

03:03:45.881 --> 03:03:48.283
PROCESS. IT WOULD PUT IT OUT OF

03:03:48.350 --> 03:03:51.186
COMPLIANCE WITH THE SEQUEL

03:03:51.253 --> 03:03:52.688
PROCESS DEVELOPED BY THE STATE.

03:03:52.755 --> 03:03:55.090
AND ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE

03:03:55.157 --> 03:03:56.792
MOVE OUT THERE IS BECAUSE IT IS

03:03:56.859 --> 03:03:59.695
MORE PLAN. IS BECAUSE THE AREAS

03:03:59.762 --> 03:04:01.497
THEY MOVED FROM AND I CAN I'VE

03:04:01.563 --> 03:04:03.665
WORKED IN THOSE AREAS YOU CAN'T

03:04:03.732 --> 03:04:05.067
EVEN DRIVE DOWN THE STREET

03:04:05.134 --> 03:04:07.236
WHERE YOU HAVE THESE ACCESSORY

03:04:07.302 --> 03:04:09.171
DWELLING UNITS AND THEN ANOTHER

03:04:09.238 --> 03:04:11.006
ONE OR THEY DECIDE TO BUILD TWO

03:04:11.073 --> 03:04:13.642
HOUSES ON ONE LOT. AND THERE'S

03:04:13.709 --> 03:04:15.444
NO INCREASE I MEAN THERE'S NO

03:04:15.511 --> 03:04:17.045
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR INCREASED

03:04:17.112 --> 03:04:19.715
VEHICLES AND END UP VEICLE

03:04:19.782 --> 03:04:23.152
MILES TRAVELED OR WHATEVER DID

03:04:23.218 --> 03:04:23.752
FORMULA IS THAT THEY'RE GOING

03:04:23.819 --> 03:04:26.221
TO USE. AND THE OTHER PART IS

03:04:26.288 --> 03:04:28.323
ESPECIALLY ON AREAS LIKE OURS.

03:04:28.390 --> 03:04:29.792
THERE ARE NO JOBS FOR PEOPLE

03:04:29.858 --> 03:04:32.428
OUT THERE. SO IF THEY COME OUT

03:04:32.494 --> 03:04:33.829
THERE ARE TENTATIVE TO BE ABLE

03:04:33.896 --> 03:04:35.864
TO AFFORD IT. AND THAT'S YET

03:04:35.931 --> 03:04:38.333
ANOTHER ISSUE THIS IS NOT BY

03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:40.836
ANY STRETCH OF IMAGINATION-

03:04:40.903 --> 03:04:43.105
GUARANTEE AFFORDABILITY. BUT IF

03:04:43.172 --> 03:04:54.483
THEY'RE ABLE TO AFFORD.

03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:55.083
SOMETHING OUT THERE MORE THAN

03:04:55.150 --> 03:04:56.185
THEY ARE- IT TOWARDS. THEY

03:04:56.251 --> 03:04:57.219
MOVED THERE AND THEY JOIN THE

03:04:57.286 --> 03:04:59.421
CAN CROWD. AND INSTEAD OF FOR

03:04:59.488 --> 03:05:00.322
OUR COMMUTE TURNS IN FIVE SIX

03:05:00.389 --> 03:05:01.790
HOUR COMMUTE VERY EVERY. DAY

03:05:01.857 --> 03:05:02.891
AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT WITHIN.

03:05:02.958 --> 03:05:04.860
OF OUR C. THE ALLOW THEIR

03:05:04.927 --> 03:05:06.862
STEVEN THIS PLAN OR THE PLAN.

03:05:06.929 --> 03:05:09.131
APPROVED IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO

03:05:09.198 --> 03:05:10.699
WHEN I LOOK AT THE COMMUNITIES

03:05:10.766 --> 03:05:12.634
THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS.

03:05:12.701 --> 03:05:13.936
WHERE THEY'VE TAKEN A LOT AND

03:05:14.002 --> 03:05:15.270
SAYING HEY YOU KNOW WHAT THIS

03:05:15.337 --> 03:05:16.438
USED TO BE A SINGLE FAMILY LOT

03:05:16.505 --> 03:05:19.508
BUT- WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW TWO

03:05:19.575 --> 03:05:20.108
OR THREE UNITS TO BE BUILT ON

03:05:20.175 --> 03:05:23.345
THAT- INSTEAD OF. TWO OR THREE

03:05:23.412 --> 03:05:24.913
UNITS I MEAN IT'S NOT A ONE

03:05:24.980 --> 03:05:26.682
UNIT THE COST. THREE AND A HALF

03:05:26.748 --> 03:05:28.884
MILLION DOLLARS. THEY HAVE

03:05:28.951 --> 03:05:30.452
THREE UNITS THAT COST TWO AND A

03:05:30.519 --> 03:05:33.055
HALF MILLION DOLLARS EACH. GO

03:05:33.121 --> 03:05:35.257
TO PALO ALTO I CAN GIVE YOU AN

03:05:35.324 --> 03:05:36.358
ADDRESS AND YOU CAN GO LOOK AT

03:05:36.425 --> 03:05:38.527
IT. IT DID NOT CREATE

03:05:38.594 --> 03:05:40.929
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT JUST

03:05:40.996 --> 03:05:42.998
CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:05:43.065 --> 03:05:44.366
SOMEBODY TO MAKE THREE TIMES AS

03:05:44.433 --> 03:05:46.735
MUCH ON THE MARKET VALUE OF

03:05:46.802 --> 03:05:49.004
WHAT'S GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA.

03:05:49.071 --> 03:05:52.841
AND SO. I DON'T SEE HOW THEY

03:05:52.908 --> 03:05:54.276
CAN SAY THIS IS GOING TO

03:05:54.343 --> 03:05:56.478
SOMEHOW MAKE A BIG SPLASH. IN

03:05:56.545 --> 03:05:58.614
THE AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE WE'RE

03:05:58.680 --> 03:06:00.082
GONNA HAVE INFILL HOUSING IN

03:06:00.148 --> 03:06:02.684
AREAS THAT WE HAD ABSOLUTELY

03:06:02.751 --> 03:06:05.020
ZERO PLANS TO DO SO. AND THAT'S

03:06:05.087 --> 03:06:05.721
WHAT YOU HEAR A LOT OF

03:06:05.787 --> 03:06:07.689
FRUSTRATION FROM PEOPLE AS THEY

03:06:07.756 --> 03:06:08.857
DON'T WANT THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS

03:06:08.924 --> 03:06:11.026
RUINS LIKE THAT. THEY MOVED OUT

03:06:11.093 --> 03:06:13.662
THERE IN THE PLANNED AREAS SO

03:06:13.729 --> 03:06:14.463
THEY KNEW WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN

03:06:14.530 --> 03:06:15.898
IN THE FUTURE. AND THEY DON'T

03:06:15.964 --> 03:06:17.599
WANT THAT RUINED. I DON'T BLAME

03:06:17.666 --> 03:06:21.670
THEM. THEY SHOULDN'T. SORRY DID

03:06:21.737 --> 03:06:22.337
YOU KNOW THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF

03:06:22.404 --> 03:06:24.840
THE ISSUES. THAT COME WITH

03:06:24.907 --> 03:06:27.209
RETROACTIVELY COMING IN. AND

03:06:27.276 --> 03:06:29.378
THEN ADDING POPULATION IN THE

03:06:29.444 --> 03:06:32.080
AREAS. THAT WE WERE TOLD WE

03:06:32.147 --> 03:06:33.849
COULDN'T. IF WE IF WE BROUGHT

03:06:33.916 --> 03:06:37.085
THAT IS A PLAN TO THE- HOUSING-

03:06:37.152 --> 03:06:39.221
FOLKS. THEY WOULD THEY WOULDN'T

03:06:39.288 --> 03:06:40.722
TURN IT DOWN. THEY WOULD HAVE

03:06:40.789 --> 03:06:43.625
TOLD US NEVER VOTE REDO THIS.

03:06:43.692 --> 03:06:44.793
SO WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE

03:06:44.860 --> 03:06:46.495
TO DO THAT THE ISSUE WITH

03:06:46.562 --> 03:06:51.133
HOUSING IS NOT. THAT. WE'RE NOT

03:06:51.199 --> 03:06:52.935
BUILDING ENOUGH INFILL HOUSING

03:06:53.001 --> 03:06:54.436
ISSUE WITH HOUSING IS THAT WE

03:06:54.503 --> 03:06:56.939
HAVE CREATED SUCH A REGULATORY

03:06:57.005 --> 03:07:01.710
MONSTROSITY. TO BUILD A HOUSE A

03:07:01.777 --> 03:07:04.646
SIMPLE HOUSE. THAT IS NOT

03:07:04.713 --> 03:07:06.582
AFFORDABLE WE'VE AFFECTED HOW

03:07:06.648 --> 03:07:08.250
MUCH MATERIALS COST IN

03:07:08.317 --> 03:07:10.586
CALIFORNIA WE'VE AFFECTED HOW

03:07:10.652 --> 03:07:13.522
MUCH LABOR COSTS IN CALIFORNIA

03:07:13.589 --> 03:07:16.258
WE'VE AFFECTED EVERY ASPECT OF

03:07:16.325 --> 03:07:18.827
BUILDING A HOME. AND THEN WE

03:07:18.894 --> 03:07:20.662
HAVE THIS ENORMOUS COST AT THE

03:07:20.729 --> 03:07:24.099
END. AND THEN WE SAY WELL IT'S

03:07:24.166 --> 03:07:26.435
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FAULT BECAUSE

03:07:26.501 --> 03:07:27.169
WE GIVE THEM A BAG OF

03:07:27.235 --> 03:07:29.972
REGULATORY ITEMS THAT THEY HAVE

03:07:30.038 --> 03:07:30.839
TO MAKE EVERY DEVELOPER GO

03:07:30.906 --> 03:07:33.342
THROUGH. TO BE ABLE TO EVEN SAY

03:07:33.408 --> 03:07:35.010
HERE CITY COUNCIL DO APPROVE

03:07:35.077 --> 03:07:37.512
THIS CITY COUNCILLORS ARE NOT

03:07:37.579 --> 03:07:39.748
NOT APPROVING PROJECTS. CITY

03:07:39.815 --> 03:07:41.550
COUNCILS ARE APPROVING PROJECT

03:07:41.617 --> 03:07:43.518
IT'S JUST A FIVE TO TEN YEAR

03:07:43.585 --> 03:07:45.621
PROCESS IT TAKES EVERY

03:07:45.687 --> 03:07:47.089
DEVELOPMENT TO GET THROUGH THAT.

03:07:47.155 --> 03:07:48.724
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO CHECK OFF

03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:50.359
EVERY SINGLE BOX OF THE

03:07:50.425 --> 03:07:53.228
CALIFORNIA STATE HAS CREATED.

03:07:53.295 --> 03:07:53.795
FOR THEM TO COME TO BUILD A

03:07:53.862 --> 03:07:56.431
HOUSE. SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO

03:07:56.498 --> 03:07:58.400
GET OUT OF THIS. BY GOING INTO

03:07:58.467 --> 03:08:00.202
EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS

03:08:00.268 --> 03:08:04.039
RETROACTIVELY ALLOWING THIS

03:08:04.106 --> 03:08:06.308
DOUBLING OF THE POPULATION. AND

03:08:06.375 --> 03:08:08.276
THEN SAYING HEY YOU KNOW NO BIG

03:08:08.343 --> 03:08:10.345
DEAL ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT

03:08:10.412 --> 03:08:13.448
BAYERN MENTAL QUALITY. THAT'S

03:08:13.515 --> 03:08:17.386
NOT GONNA HAPPEN AND THEN ALL

03:08:17.452 --> 03:08:19.388
WILL HAVE IS OVER DENSIFY

03:08:19.454 --> 03:08:21.556
NEIGHBOURHOODS. WITH PEOPLE

03:08:21.623 --> 03:08:22.758
THAT NEED TO COSTS CONTINUE TO

03:08:22.824 --> 03:08:24.259

03:12:12.754 --> 03:12:13.722
EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS DOLLARS

03:12:13.788 --> 03:12:16.725
REALLY WORKING FIFTY. AND THEN

03:12:16.791 --> 03:12:19.127
THE DOWNSIDE OF A JOB DOWN

03:12:19.194 --> 03:12:22.530

STATE ACTUALLY CORPORATE OWNED

03:12:44.519 --> 03:12:46.922
SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF UNITS

03:12:46.988 --> 03:12:49.257
IN THE STATE ARE OWNED BY HI

03:12:49.324 --> 03:12:51.393

03:15:06.561 --> 03:15:08.630
LEGALIZED IN LAW UNITS AND SAN

03:15:08.696 --> 03:15:10.899
FRANCISCO EIGHTY YEARS. THIRTY

03:15:10.965 --> 03:15:11.633
THOUSAND OF THEM IN OUR CITY

03:15:11.699 --> 03:15:14.702
AND AT THE TIME IN TWO THOUSAND

03:15:14.769 --> 03:15:15.270
NINE. I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS

03:15:15.336 --> 03:15:16.971
CRAZY. THAT IF WE WERE TO

03:15:17.038 --> 03:15:18.039
CONSIDER DOING THAT WOULD

03:15:18.106 --> 03:15:18.840
CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF OUR

03:15:18.907 --> 03:15:22.710
CITY- THAT IT WENT. UP CREATE

03:15:22.777 --> 03:15:25.680
UNITS OR NOT AFFORDABLE- AND-

03:15:25.747 --> 03:15:26.748
AND LITERALLY DESTRUCTION

03:15:26.815 --> 03:15:28.316
UNITIES. I DID MOVE IT THAT

03:15:28.383 --> 03:15:29.884
YEAR. IT TOOK A COUPLE OF YEARS

03:15:29.951 --> 03:15:32.053
BEFORE I AUTHORED ONE OF THE

03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:33.988
VERY EARLIEST LOCALIZED. TO

03:15:34.055 --> 03:15:35.857
ALLOW THE CREATION OF EIGHTY

03:15:35.924 --> 03:15:37.859
USE. AND SINCE THAT TIME I

03:15:37.926 --> 03:15:38.927
THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY WE'VE

03:15:38.993 --> 03:15:40.762
ALL SEEN THE POSITIVE IMPACT.

03:15:40.829 --> 03:15:42.597
OF EIGHTY LAW ON OUR STATES

03:15:42.664 --> 03:15:43.731
WE'VE SEEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

03:15:43.798 --> 03:15:45.967
UNITS. TUCKED AWAY IN GARAGES

03:15:46.034 --> 03:15:48.036
AND BACKYARDS WERE MOSTLY

03:15:48.103 --> 03:15:51.539
AFFORDABLE TO FOLKS. OF AVERAGE

03:15:51.606 --> 03:15:53.475
TO BELOW AVERAGE INCOMES. AND

03:15:53.541 --> 03:15:54.776
IT'S MY PERSPECTIVE THAT THIS

03:15:54.843 --> 03:15:56.478
BILL WILL BUILD ON THE SUCCESS

03:15:56.544 --> 03:15:57.946
OF THAT. AND WILL HAVE THE

03:15:58.012 --> 03:15:59.781
POTENTIAL TO HAVE SIMILARLY

03:15:59.848 --> 03:16:01.749
BENEFICIAL IMPACTS.

03:16:01.816 --> 03:16:04.052
PARTICULARLY AND ESPECIALLY.

03:16:04.119 --> 03:16:05.053
FOR LOWER INCOME PROPERTY

03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:07.322
OWNERS WHO THROUGH. LOT SPLIT

03:16:07.388 --> 03:16:08.723
PROVISIONS WILL BE ABLE TO

03:16:08.790 --> 03:16:10.291
REALIZE THE VALUE OF THEIR

03:16:10.358 --> 03:16:12.427
PROPERTY WITHOUT HAVING TO MOVE

03:16:12.494 --> 03:16:15.463
AWAY- I WANT TO. ASO JUST

03:16:15.530 --> 03:16:17.499
ACKNOWLEDGE. YOU KNOW A LOT OF

03:16:17.565 --> 03:16:18.666
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL BUT I

03:16:18.733 --> 03:16:20.635
WOULD ASK FOLKS WHO OPPOSE THIS

03:16:20.702 --> 03:16:22.270
BILL TO JUST CONSIDER WHETHER

03:16:22.337 --> 03:16:23.771
EIGHTY LAW. WHICH HAS BEEN IN

03:16:23.838 --> 03:16:25.673
PLACE NOW FOR GETTING CLOSE TO

03:16:25.740 --> 03:16:28.209
FIVE YEARS- HAS LED TO THE

03:16:28.276 --> 03:16:29.377
IMPACTS THAT THEY'RE DESCRIBING

03:16:29.444 --> 03:16:32.147
ABOUT. THIS BILL- I THINK THAT

03:16:32.213 --> 03:16:34.082
SB NINE IS ABOUT MAKING A

03:16:34.149 --> 03:16:36.351
DIFFERENCE ONE UNIT AT A TIME-

03:16:36.417 --> 03:16:37.785
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.

03:16:37.852 --> 03:16:40.188
ALSO NOTE. THE FACT THAT THERE

03:16:40.255 --> 03:16:41.256
IS AN OWNER OCCUPIED

03:16:41.322 --> 03:16:43.158
REQUIREMENT WHICH MEANS THAT

03:16:43.224 --> 03:16:44.959
HOMEOWNERS WILL HAVE FULL

03:16:45.026 --> 03:16:46.361
CONTROL OVER THEIR SPACE AND

03:16:46.427 --> 03:16:47.829
SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS.

03:16:47.896 --> 03:16:49.831
THE FACT THAT THIS IS OPTIONAL

03:16:49.898 --> 03:16:51.399
MEANS AT THE STATE WE ARE NOT

03:16:51.466 --> 03:16:52.700
FORCING ANYTHING IT'S UP TO

03:16:52.767 --> 03:16:54.836
AGAIN. BLOCK BY BLOCK HOME

03:16:54.903 --> 03:16:57.639
OWNER BY OWNER TO DECIDE WHAT

03:16:57.705 --> 03:16:59.407
THEY WANT TO DO- I KNOW OUR

03:16:59.474 --> 03:17:01.709
COLLEAGUE FROM ROCKLAND IS NO

03:17:01.776 --> 03:17:03.378
LONGER- HERE IN THE COMMITTEE

03:17:03.444 --> 03:17:04.779
ROOM TODAY BUT I JUST WANT TO

03:17:04.846 --> 03:17:05.713
SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT LAST

03:17:05.780 --> 03:17:07.215
YEAR. I THINK WE'RE ALL

03:17:07.282 --> 03:17:07.882
FRUSTRATED THIS DIDN'T GET DONE

03:17:07.949 --> 03:17:10.051
LAST YEAR- BUT THAT'S NOT A

03:17:10.118 --> 03:17:11.386
REASON FOR US TO NOT DO IT THIS

03:17:11.452 --> 03:17:13.454
YEAR IN FACT IT'S- ALL THAT

03:17:13.521 --> 03:17:14.088
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT WE HAVE TO

03:17:14.155 --> 03:17:15.757
GET IT DONE THIS YEAR. AND I

03:17:15.823 --> 03:17:16.858
THINK MANY OF US WOULD

03:17:16.925 --> 03:17:18.193
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH WHAT

03:17:18.259 --> 03:17:19.827
HAPPENED LAST YEAR LAST YEAR WE

03:17:19.894 --> 03:17:21.062
HAD THE WORST PANDEMIC IN A

03:17:21.129 --> 03:17:22.764
HUNDRED YEARS. IT REQUIRED

03:17:22.830 --> 03:17:25.099
TEMPORARY SHUTDOWNS PANDEMIC

03:17:25.166 --> 03:17:26.935
RECESSION WILDFIRES SOCIAL

03:17:27.001 --> 03:17:28.736
PROTEST MEMBERS WHO GOT CODED.

03:17:28.803 --> 03:17:30.338
THAT'S WHAT CHALLENGES LAST

03:17:30.405 --> 03:17:33.007
YEAR BUT- I THINK IT'S OUR JOB

03:17:33.074 --> 03:17:33.908
TO DO THE PEOPLE'S WORK AT THIS

03:17:33.975 --> 03:17:36.144
POINT- ONE FINAL THING I WANT

03:17:36.211 --> 03:17:37.679
TO SAY IS- YOU KNOW THERE WAS A

03:17:37.745 --> 03:17:39.314
SUGGESTION AROUND. WHAT

03:17:39.380 --> 03:17:40.315
INTERESTS ARE SORT OF DRIVING

03:17:40.381 --> 03:17:42.417
THIS AND- I WOULD SAY FROM MY

03:17:42.483 --> 03:17:43.451
PERSPECTIVE AS A CHAIR OF THIS

03:17:43.518 --> 03:17:45.253
COMMITTEE. THERE ARE MANY

03:17:45.320 --> 03:17:47.522
STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE STATE

03:17:47.589 --> 03:17:48.523
OR INVOLVED IN HOUSING. EVERY

03:17:48.590 --> 03:17:49.857
STAKEHOLDER HAS THEIR

03:17:49.924 --> 03:17:52.093
PARTICULAR. IDEA OF WHAT WE

03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:53.828
NEED TO DO. AND IT'S MY

03:17:53.895 --> 03:17:55.263
PERSPECTIVE THAT I THINK THE

03:17:55.330 --> 03:17:56.898
REASON WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS

03:17:56.965 --> 03:17:59.234
IS THAT FOR EVERY REAL PROPOSED

03:17:59.300 --> 03:18:01.302
SOLUTION LIKE THIS ONE. THERE

03:18:01.369 --> 03:18:03.471
ARE MANY OPPOSITION- LOT OF

03:18:03.538 --> 03:18:05.440
FOLKS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.

03:18:05.506 --> 03:18:07.275
UPSETTING THE STATUS QUO. AND

03:18:07.342 --> 03:18:08.843
WHAT WE'VE SEEN FOR YEARS

03:18:08.910 --> 03:18:10.712
AROUND HOUSING POLITICS IN THE

03:18:10.778 --> 03:18:12.513
STATE IS THAT NOTHING HAPPENS.

03:18:12.580 --> 03:18:15.383
OR PUT ANOTHER WAY. DIFFERENT

03:18:15.450 --> 03:18:15.984
INTERESTS OR FIGURE OUT HOW TO

03:18:16.050 --> 03:18:17.852
SAY NO. I THINK WE HAVE A

03:18:17.919 --> 03:18:19.887
CHANCE TODAY TO SAY YES I

03:18:19.954 --> 03:18:22.090
UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW VOTING. TO

03:18:22.156 --> 03:18:23.024
MOVE THIS FORWARD WILL TAKE

03:18:23.091 --> 03:18:25.026
COURAGE BUT I APPRECIATE THE

03:18:25.093 --> 03:18:26.928
COURAGE THAT IT TAKES TO SAY

03:18:26.995 --> 03:18:29.063
THE STATUS QUO IS BROKEN. TO

03:18:29.130 --> 03:18:30.498
SAY THAT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE SOME

03:18:30.565 --> 03:18:31.833
HARD STEPS TO ADDRESS THIS

03:18:31.899 --> 03:18:33.368
CRISIS AND WITH THAT I'M NOT

03:18:33.434 --> 03:18:35.003

WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT

03:20:50.304 --> 03:20:51.839
WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST

03:20:51.906 --> 03:20:54.008
STATE IN THE NATION TO FOCUS ON

STEP TO SOLVING OUR HOMELESS

PROGRAMS WE CAN DO TO HELP THEM

03:21:17.131 --> 03:21:19.066
AND THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THAT

03:21:19.133 --> 03:21:20.868

GIVING CITIES A VOLUNTARY TOOL

03:46:46.259 --> 03:46:48.094
AND I THINK- SOMETIMES THERE'S

03:46:48.161 --> 03:46:49.195
A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT

03:46:49.262 --> 03:46:50.129
SPREADS AROUND ABOUT

03:46:50.196 --> 03:46:52.165

03:46:52.231 --> 03:46:54.467
NOTE SB TEN IS PURELY VOLUNTARY

03:46:54.534 --> 03:46:55.835
FOR CITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE TO

03:46:55.902 --> 03:46:57.570
UTILIZE IT THE CITY IGNORES IT

03:46:57.637 --> 03:46:59.706
AND TAKES NO ACTION. SB TIME

03:46:59.772 --> 03:47:00.740

03:47:00.807 --> 03:47:04.077
THAT CITY. WE FREQUENTLY- TELL

03:47:05.745 --> 03:47:06.946
ON HOUSING ONE OF HIS OWN FOR

03:47:07.013 --> 03:47:10.350
MORE. HOUSING WHAT YOU TO ALLOW

03:47:10.416 --> 03:47:10.950
MORE HOUSING. BUT THEN WE MAKE

03:47:11.017 --> 03:47:11.985
A REALLY HARD FOR CITIES TO DO

03:47:12.051 --> 03:47:14.153
THAT SB TIME- I'VE HEARD THAT

03:47:14.220 --> 03:47:15.121
LOUD AND CLEAR WITH CITIES THAT

03:47:15.188 --> 03:47:16.389
PLEASE JUST MAKE OUR LIVES

03:47:16.456 --> 03:47:18.157
EASIER SB TEN DOES THAT. BY

03:47:18.224 --> 03:47:19.826
SAYING THAT IF THE CITY DECIDES

03:47:19.892 --> 03:47:21.461
THAT HE WANTS HIS OWN. FOR

03:47:21.527 --> 03:47:23.663
SMALL MULTI UNIT CONSTRUCTION

03:47:23.730 --> 03:47:25.832

03:47:29.168 --> 03:47:31.537
STREAMLINED AND EXPEDITED WAY

THIS WILL MAKE CITIES LIVES A

03:47:32.905 --> 03:47:36.976
LOT EASIER- AND- I THINK IT'S A

03:47:37.043 --> 03:47:39.379
IT'S A GOOD POWERFUL NEW TOOL.

03:47:39.445 --> 03:47:40.113

BUILDINGS- IS A REALLY GOOD

03:47:53.559 --> 03:47:55.728
OPTION IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE TO

03:47:55.795 --> 03:47:57.697
BUILD. IT MELTS INTO A

03:47:57.764 --> 03:47:59.298
NEIGHBORHOOD MORE BECAUSE IT'S

03:47:59.365 --> 03:48:00.800
NOT NECESSARILY- SHE DOES HAVE

03:48:00.867 --> 03:48:03.102
TO BE A HUGE BUILDING- AND IT

03:48:03.169 --> 03:48:04.737

04:26:58.335 --> 04:26:59.903
MIGHT PAY- THAT VOTED FOR IT

04:26:59.970 --> 04:27:01.705
AND AM I CORRECT THIS THIS THIS

04:27:01.772 --> 04:27:02.973
TOOL THAT YOU WOULD BE PROVIDED

04:27:03.040 --> 04:27:04.174
CITIES. IT'S COMPLETELY

04:27:04.241 --> 04:27:05.409
VOLUNTARY CORRECT THIS IS

04:27:05.476 --> 04:27:07.177
SOMETHING THAT I CITY COUNCIL

04:27:07.244 --> 04:27:07.845
COULD DECIDE TO USE IF THEY

04:27:07.911 --> 04:27:09.813
WANTED AND ALSO A CITY THAT

04:27:09.880 --> 04:27:10.914
DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS WOULD BE

04:27:10.981 --> 04:27:11.982
FREE NOT TO USE IT THAT'S

04:27:12.049 --> 04:27:14.251
CORRECT- I HEARD A LOUD AND

04:27:14.318 --> 04:27:16.120
CLEAR. OF MY LIFE A LOT OF

04:27:16.186 --> 04:27:17.554
PREVIOUS HOUSING BILL I DID

04:27:17.621 --> 04:27:18.722
CITY SAYING JUST GIVE US MORE

04:27:18.789 --> 04:27:20.391
TOOLS. AND I THINK SOMETIMES

04:27:20.457 --> 04:27:21.458
YOU HAVE TO HAVE STANDARDS AND

04:27:21.525 --> 04:27:22.960
RULES AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO

04:27:23.026 --> 04:27:24.828
GIVE VOLUNTARY TOOLS. AND THIS

04:27:24.895 --> 04:27:26.964
IS A TOTALLY VOLUNTARY BILL

04:27:27.030 --> 04:27:29.099
BILL IF A CITY THEY DON'T EVEN

04:27:29.166 --> 04:27:30.834
HAVE TO ASK TO OPT OUT. IF THE

04:27:30.901 --> 04:27:32.703
CITY DOES NOTHING TO SING NOR

04:27:32.770 --> 04:27:34.671
IS IT. THEN THE BILL HAS NO

04:27:34.738 --> 04:27:36.673
APPLICATION THAT CITY ONLY IF

04:27:36.740 --> 04:27:38.842
THE CITY AFFIRMATIVELY. THE

04:27:38.909 --> 04:27:40.077
CITY COUNCIL PASSES AN

04:27:40.144 --> 04:27:41.245
ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION ONLY

04:27:41.311 --> 04:27:45.749
VAN THE CITY OFTEN OTHERWISE IT

04:27:45.816 --> 04:27:46.550
HAS NO IMPACT PURELY VOLUNTARY.

04:27:46.617 --> 04:27:47.985
YEAH I THINK I THINK YOU CENTER

04:27:48.051 --> 04:27:50.053
ONO THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING

04:27:50.120 --> 04:27:50.954
THAT I THINK THERE'S A REALLY

04:27:51.021 --> 04:27:52.823
IMPORTANT POINTS THAT THAT ARE

04:27:52.890 --> 04:27:54.825
WORTHY OF BEING ELEVATED. YOU

04:27:54.892 --> 04:27:55.526

04:27:55.592 --> 04:27:56.760

04:27:56.827 --> 04:27:57.728
IN MY COMMITTEE AND ALSO WITH A

04:27:57.795 --> 04:27:59.129
LOT OF LOCAL IF. ELECTED

04:27:59.196 --> 04:28:00.330
OFFICIALS ALL OVER THE STATE OF

04:28:00.397 --> 04:28:02.633
CALIFORNIA WHO- YOU KNOW HAVE

04:28:02.699 --> 04:28:03.867
HAVE WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT

04:28:03.934 --> 04:28:06.270
HOUSING POLICY. AND ONE OF YOU

04:28:06.336 --> 04:28:07.304
KNOW IN IN SOME OF THEM HAVE

04:28:07.371 --> 04:28:08.572
BEEN HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED ABOUT

04:28:08.639 --> 04:28:09.606
THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

04:28:09.673 --> 04:28:10.908
DON AND I'M FRUSTRATED WITH

04:28:10.974 --> 04:28:13.143
VOTES THAT I'VE TAKEN. IN YOU

04:28:13.210 --> 04:28:13.777
KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS A LOT OF

04:28:13.844 --> 04:28:15.179
THESE FOLKS HAVE SENT TO ME AS-

04:28:15.245 --> 04:28:16.447
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT

04:28:16.513 --> 04:28:17.581
ANTI HOUSING WE CAN ALL IT'S

04:28:17.648 --> 04:28:18.649
THAT THERE'S A HOUSING CRISIS

04:28:18.715 --> 04:28:19.516
WE JUST BELIEVE IN LOCAL

04:28:19.583 --> 04:28:20.851
CONTROL. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE

04:28:20.918 --> 04:28:21.718
DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE AT THE

04:28:21.785 --> 04:28:23.754
LOCAL LEVEL. AND I THINK WHAT

04:28:23.821 --> 04:28:24.788
WE'VE DONE WITH THE AMENDMENTS

04:28:24.855 --> 04:28:25.989
THAT YOU'VE TAKEN TODAY WHICH

04:28:26.056 --> 04:28:27.558
HAVE ADDRESSED THE PRIMARY

04:28:27.624 --> 04:28:28.192
CONCERNS THAT I'VE HEARD FROM

04:28:28.258 --> 04:28:30.127
FOLKS IN MY COMMUNITY- AND JUST

04:28:30.194 --> 04:28:31.061
WITH THE ENTIRE THRUST OF THE

04:28:31.128 --> 04:28:32.663
BILL. I THINK IT REALLY CALLS

04:28:32.729 --> 04:28:33.664
INTO QUESTION FOR A LOT OF

04:28:33.730 --> 04:28:34.932
THOSE FOLKS RIGHT THIS IS THIS

04:28:34.998 --> 04:28:36.066
IS THIS IS A BILL THAT

04:28:36.133 --> 04:28:37.234
FUNDAMENTALLY PRESERVES LOCAL

04:28:37.301 --> 04:28:39.236
CONTROL- IS VERY MUCH IN LINE

04:28:39.303 --> 04:28:40.437
WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S WHY

04:28:40.504 --> 04:28:41.004
IT'S YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT

04:28:41.071 --> 04:28:42.406
GONNA BELIEVE US. SENATOR

04:28:42.473 --> 04:28:43.941
GLAZERS WHO VOTED FOR WHO IS A

04:28:44.007 --> 04:28:45.509
STRONG PROPONENT OF LOCAL

04:28:45.576 --> 04:28:47.244
CONTROL SO I THINK THIS IS. I

04:28:47.311 --> 04:28:48.445
WOULD HOPE THAT WITH THESE

04:28:48.512 --> 04:28:49.413
AMENDMENTS THAT A LOT OF THE

04:28:49.480 --> 04:28:50.414
FOLKS WHO CALLED IN TODAY WHO

04:28:50.481 --> 04:28:51.448
MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THOSE

04:28:51.515 --> 04:28:53.250
AMENDMENTS. WOULD WOULD COME

04:28:53.317 --> 04:28:54.718
OFF IN OPPOSITION IN THE BILL-

04:28:54.785 --> 04:28:56.320
BECAUSE IF YOUR CONCERN IS

04:28:56.386 --> 04:28:57.588
REALLY ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL IF

04:28:57.654 --> 04:28:58.622
IT'S REALLY ABOUT PRESERVING

04:28:58.689 --> 04:29:00.390
OPEN SPACE. THEN YOUR CONCERNS
