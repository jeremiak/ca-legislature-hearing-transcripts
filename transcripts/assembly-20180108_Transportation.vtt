00:37:04.089 --> 00:37:08.760 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS CENTRALLY FOCUSED.

00:37:06.658 --> 00:37:10.662 region:rollup2

SO.

00:37:26.044 --> 00:37:31.749 region:rollup2
THE RAILROAD IS NOT A HIGHWAY.

00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:34.119 region:rollup2
AND.

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:38.022 region:rollup2
A YEAH GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND.

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:39.891 region:rollup2

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:50.835 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:37:48.233 --> 00:37:52.403 region:rollup2

THE PROCESS FOR DIEM VIA THOMAS

00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:22.653 region:rollup2
VEHICLE REGULATIONS HAS BEEN.

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:24.555 region:rollup2
VERY ARDUOUS.

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:27.391 region:rollup2
AND MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IT'S NOT

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:29.260 region:rollup2
YET COMPLETE AND YOUR BILL.

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:30.761 region:rollup2
PROPOSES TO CODIFY ESSENTIALLY

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.629 region:rollup2
A SNAPSHOT IN TIME THAT

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:33.531 region:rollup2
TODAY.

00:45:31.629 --> 00:45:34.932 region:rollup2
THE REGULATIONS DEALING WITH

00:45:33.531 --> 00:45:37.134 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY AND WHILE I

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:37.969 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY AGREE THAT THE SAFETY

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:39.303 region:rollup2
OF THE PUBLIC IS PARAMOUNT

00:45:37.969 --> 00:45:40.805 region:rollup2
THERE'S STILL A CHANCE THAT THE

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:43.841 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS MIGHT CHANGE.

00:45:40.805 --> 00:45:44.475 region:rollup2

REGULATIONS GIVEN THAT THERE'S

00:45:47.612 --> 00:45:50.381 region:rollup2
STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT THAT

00:45:48.379 --> 00:45:51.315 region:rollup2
THINGS MUCH.

00:45:50.381 --> 00:45:52.216 region:rollup2

WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY ADAPTING

00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:59.390 region:rollup2
KATINA WANNA WORK WITH DMB AND

00:45:56.487 --> 00:46:01.559 region:rollup2
ADAPT THE LEGISLATION TO MIRROR

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:03.027 region:rollup2
OR TO HOT MATCH WHAT THEY'RE

00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:04.428 region:rollup2
THINKING WE DO APPRECIATE THAT

00:46:03.027 --> 00:46:05.396 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BUT AS I

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:07.265 region:rollup2
STARTED.

00:46:05.396 --> 00:46:09.367 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS BEGAN TO HAVE

00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:09.934 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO WE REACHED OUT TO DIEM

00:46:09.367 --> 00:46:12.336 region:rollup2
BE.

00:46:09.934 --> 00:46:13.971 region:rollup2
TODAY TO CONFIRM WHEN THE

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:14.505 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS MAY ACTUALLY BE DONE

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:16.374 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY VERY

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:17.742 region:rollup2
CLEAR.

00:46:16.374 --> 00:46:19.110 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY COULD BE DONE SO WE

00:46:17.742 --> 00:46:21.078 region:rollup2
GET A PROCESS THAT COULD BE DONE

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:23.014 region:rollup2
TOMORROW OR COULD BE DONE IN A

00:46:21.078 --> 00:46:25.383 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS. WHAT I DO BELIEVE

00:46:23.014 --> 00:46:27.952 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

00:46:25.383 --> 00:46:29.053 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH THE BUREAUCRACY BUT

00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:30.988 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME WE ALSO HAVE

00:46:29.053 --> 00:46:32.056 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK FASTER

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:34.258 region:rollup2
THAN THE BUREAUCRACY?

00:46:32.056 --> 00:46:35.726 region:rollup2
SO. CLEARLY PUBLIC CITIZEN THAT

00:46:34.258 --> 00:46:37.128 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO HEAR FROM EACH OF OUR

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:38.429 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS.

00:46:37.128 --> 00:46:40.364 region:rollup2
AYE IMPORTS WE HAD THE

00:46:38.429 --> 00:46:42.333 region:rollup2
MISFORTUNE OF HAVING THIS ISSUE

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:44.168 region:rollup2
COME INTO MY DISTRICT MUCH

00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:45.770 region:rollup2
SOONER THAN THAT ALL OF YOU. BUT

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:47.104 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU IT'S IT'S NOT A

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.139 region:rollup2
VERY POSSIBLE CONVERSATION WHEN

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:50.541 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:46:48.139 --> 00:46:52.810 region:rollup2
CONCERNED. THAT THEY CAN'T GET

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:55.413 region:rollup2
VEHICLES OFF THE STREET THAT ARE

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:56.213 region:rollup2
DEEMED TO BE UNSAFE. ON INTEL

00:46:55.413 --> 00:46:58.049 region:rollup2
THE CREATED ACCIDENT TELL

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:58.816 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY RUN OVER SOMEBODY TELL

00:46:58.049 --> 00:47:01.085 region:rollup2
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A MOVING

00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:02.620 region:rollup2
VIOLATION. SO WE DON'T REALLY

00:47:01.085 --> 00:47:03.788 region:rollup2
WANT TO HAVE ANY COMMUNITIES

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.923 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY IN THAT.

00:47:03.788 --> 00:47:06.824 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE SO WE ARE WE ARE

THE. ATTACK COMMUNITY IN TRYING

00:47:11.962 --> 00:47:16.367 region:rollup2
TO IRON R. THESE ISSUES OUT BUT

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:18.302 region:rollup2
AGAIN. THE ONLY ISSUE IS WHETHER

00:47:16.367 --> 00:47:20.004 region:rollup2
OR NOT THIS SHOULD BE CODIFIED A

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:20.705 region:rollup2
LOT THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THE

00:47:20.004 --> 00:47:23.341 region:rollup2
POLICY.

00:47:20.705 --> 00:47:25.109 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN WE THINK THIS IS A VERY

00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:26.877 region:rollup2
GOOD OUR FIRST STEP.

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:28.145 region:rollup2
I DO BELIEVE THAT THESE

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:30.014 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS AROUND LAW

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:32.583 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT NEED TO BE.

00:47:30.014 --> 00:47:34.151 region:rollup2
TO BE CODIFIED SO JUST TO ANSWER

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:35.186 region:rollup2
WAS FRIEDMAN QUESTIONS IS WHAT

00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:36.354 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK

00:47:35.186 --> 00:47:38.956 region:rollup2
WITH THAT TECH COMMUNE YOU SEE

00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:40.858 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN FIND. I FIND A BRIDGE

00:47:38.956 --> 00:47:42.159 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN WE THINK THAT PUBLIC

00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:44.261 region:rollup2
SAFETY SHOULD BE CUT SHOULD BE

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:46.230 region:rollup2
PARAMOUNT. AND THAT IT IS THE

00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:47.965 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANIES

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:50.034 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PUTTING THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:51.936 region:rollup2
ONTO OUR STREETS TO WORK WITH

00:47:50.034 --> 00:47:53.270 region:rollup2
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO ENSURE

00:47:51.936 --> 00:47:55.506 region:rollup2
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOWS HOW

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.807 region:rollup2
TO REACT KNOWS WHAT TO DO ARM

00:47:55.506 --> 00:47:58.109 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS AROUND

00:47:56.807 --> 00:48:00.611 region:rollup2
DRIVERLESS CARS SO THESE ARE

00:47:58.109 --> 00:48:01.612 region:rollup2
CARS WITHOUT. PEOPLE INSIDE SO

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:03.381 region:rollup2
THEIR DEATH WE NEED TO BE

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:03.981 region:rollup2
INTERFACE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:04.749 region:rollup2
SO THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO

00:48:03.981 --> 00:48:05.883 region:rollup2
SHUT

00:48:04.749 --> 00:48:07.718 region:rollup2
S. CARS DOWN. IF FOR SOME REASON

00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:09.353 region:rollup2
SOMETHING HAPPENS

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:10.588 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN WE THINK IT'S HIS ARM.

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:11.989 region:rollup2
A VERY MILD.

00:48:10.588 --> 00:48:13.090 region:rollup2
FIRST STEP.

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:14.658 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO THINK IT IS AN

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.960 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FIRST STEP TO ENSURE

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:18.996 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN SAFETY OF

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.563 region:rollup2

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:22.099 region:rollup2
AND I'LL JUST ACCEPTED AT MY

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:23.000 region:rollup2
CLOSET THAT'S OKAY.

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:27.138 region:rollup2
NEARLY MEMBERS WOULD COMMIT

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.974 region:rollup2

HOWEVER.

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:47.825 region:rollup2
THE TESTING OF BABIES WITHOUT
