WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PRESENTER ITEM NUMBER. ONE CENTER VALLEY. A BILL RELATING TO ENERGY BUILDING STANDARDS FOR WILL TAKE REQUIREMENTS. WELCOME. THE CONTENT. AND JUST FOR THE PUBLIC'S BENEFIT FOR THE MEMBERS BENEFIT -- WE HAVE THREE ITEMS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR THOSE ARE ITEMS NUMBER TWO NUMBER FIVE AND NUMBER. SEVEN OF BILLS A. B.. FOUR EIGHT EIGHT AB EIGHT EIGHTY AND AB -- TEN SEVENTEEN THE MORNING WHEN YOU'RE READY THEN ENTERS AND SHARED THANK YOU FOR A BY IS TO PRESENT BILL. AB -- ONE SEVENTY EIGHT SO LAST YEAR WE BURNED -- THERE'S ABOUT ONE AND A HALF MILLION ACRES WAS BURNED IN CALIFORNIA AND I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT IS CITIES OF READING. AND ALSO MIGUEL YOU WHICH WAS -- IS RIGHT NEXT TO PARADISE SO ELEVEN THOUSAND MY CONSTITUENTS IN -- BUTTE COUNTY WERE AFFECTED. BY THE CAMPFIRE AND WE LOST THOUSANDS OF STRUCTURES. EIGHTY SEVEN LIVES IN THAT THAT FIRE AND SO THIS BILL -- THERE'S A CC MANDATE TO HAVE FORMAL TAKES ON EVERY NEW CONSTRUCTION AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY SO THIS BILL NARROWLY -- EXEMPTS THOSE WHO DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE -- TO AT THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE VERBAL TAKES ON THEIR HOMES AND SO THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THEM AN EXEMPTION UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES EXACT SQUARE FOOTAGE -- IT WITHOUT THAT MANDATE ON THEM SO -- THAT'S THIS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. A VERY WELL. DO WE HAVE ANY -- SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT YES GOOD MORNING JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. ARE MEMBER COUNTIES CONTAIN MUCH OF THE STATE'S FOREST LANDS AND FOR A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES -- THOSE FIRES OFTEN HIT ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OR COMMUNITIES WITH A LARGE PORTION OF THE POPULATION THAT HAVE LOW INCOMES OR ON FIXED INCOMES. THIS NEW CC MANDATE WILL IMPACT THOSE TENS OF THOUSANDS I THINK IT WAS FIFTEEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES FOR THE CAMPFIRE AND FIVE THOUSAND FOR THE TUBS FIRE -- BUT THAT WON'T BE -- THAT CONSTRUCTION WILL BEGIN UNTIL AFTER -- TWENTY TWENTY THE CC MANDATE WITHOUT ABOUT NINE TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ONTHE COST OF REBUILDING AND FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS EITHER WITHOUT INSURANCE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN -- BECAUSE OF THE COST OF INSURANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY. OR BECAUSE THEY WERE UNINSURED UNDER INSURED THIS BILL WILL HELP THEM BY REDUCING THE COST FOR REBUILDING WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR KERRY MEMBERS MY NAME IS KELLY COVERAGE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND WE'RE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IT IS SO VERY NARROWLY APPLIED THAT IT REALLY WILL BENEFIT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING THE TOUGHEST TIME REBUILDING THEIR LIVES AFTER THIS DISASTER SO WE ARE DRY VOTE THANK YOU -- SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. AT A RALLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT THANKS [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. FORTY CHAIRED MEMBERS. MORE COMMONLY HAVE A SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA WE APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWED THE BILL. BUT THE BILL STILL FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NOTABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTIES REVOLVING AROUND INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND CLIMATE CHANGE. WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE AND HELP HOMEOWNERS REBUILD USING ELECTRICITY SOURCE THAT IS LESS DEPENDENT ON A GRADE AND NO LONGER RELIES ON A TRANSMISSION SYSTEM THAT IS FAILING. WHILE WE ARE SYMPATHETIC WITH THE VICTIMS OF THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES AND RECOGNIZE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF REBUILDING. WE ARE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF REBUILDING IN A WAY THAT WILL INCREASE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE HELP REPAIRS SAVE MONEY ON THEIR UTILITY BILLS WHILE ALSO KEEPING CALIFORNIA ON TRACK TO MEET ITS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. THE CURRENT FULLER REQUIREMENTS ARE DESIGNED T SAVE MONEY AND IMPROVE RESILIENCY FOR FIRE VICTIMS. AND WE UNDERSTAND THE COST CAN BE INTIMIDATING BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO FINANCE SOLAR INSTALLATIONS. THESE INCLUDE FULL FINANCING OPTIONS SUCH AS SOLAR LEASING AGREEMENTS AND POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR CUSTOMERS PAY NOTHING UP FRONT. AND SAVE MONEY FROM DAY ONE AS THE UTILITY BILL SAVINGS OUTWEIGH THE FINANCE PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION TO CUSTOMER SAVINGS ON BILLS THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE RESILIENCY BENEFITS OF ROOFTOP SOLAR. POWER LINES ARE DOWN OR DE ENERGIZED WHICH MAY BE INCREASINGLY COMMON PARTICULARLY IN FIRE PRONE AREAS. EXEMPTING BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS THAT REDUCE ENERGY USE FROM THE GREAT AND LOWER MONTHLY BILLS IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND CONSENT ABOUT PRESIDENT. CALIFORNIA HAS ADOPTED BUILDING STANDARDS THAT WILL HELP REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. CALIFORNIA IS RECOGNIZED AS A GLOBAL LEADER IN CLEAN ENERGY FOR A REASON THE STATE HAS SET TARGETS AND CREATED STANDARDS THAT ARE CHALLENGING BUT ULTIMATELY HELP CALIFORNIANS PREPARE AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE STANDARDS WERE DESIGNED TO SAVE HOMEOWNERS MONEY AND PROVIDE A RESILIENT ENERGY SOLUTION FOR AREAS AT RISK OF WILDFIRES AND OTHER DISASTERS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE-THIS OPPORTUNITY TO STYLISH A COURT CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL HUESO. PRESENT WITH A PRESIDENT MORE LACK BRADFORD KING. IN HERE DODD HERTZBERG HILL. HILL HERE MCGUIRE RUBIO. RUBIO HERE SKINNER STERN. TURN HERE STONE DOWN HERE WINNER WIENER PRESENT. WE HAVE A QUORUM. OF WERE STILL TAKING TESTIMONY SO -- WE HAVE A SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION THE RESTROOM. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OF ROTARY COMING UP OF SOMEONE IN THE LAND FOR SOLAR CHOICE. ALSO IN OPPOSITION REGRETTABLY -- WHILE THE AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER THAT THE OBJECTIVES ARE CERTAINLY LAUDABLE OUR SYMPATHY GOES OUT. TO THE VICTIMS OF FIRES HOWEVER -- PART OF THE THE CHALLENGE WITH WITH THIS BILL IN WITH THE ONGOING POLICY FOR CALIFORNIA'S HOW DO WE MAKE THE GRID MORE RESILIENT. HOW DO WE PROTECT FAMILIES AND HOMEOWNERS DURING FIRES WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE PANELS AND BATTERIES? ARE ARE SIGNIFICANT IN A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE DISCUSSION GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF RESILIENCY. THANK YOU FOR THE PEOPLE OF ENERGY AND LET OF FIRES AND THE QUESTION I THINK THAT THE THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS. WHAT IN MORE TALKING ABOUT AREAS THAT ARE ARE? ARE PRONE AND SUBJECT TO FIRES IN THE FUTURE [inaudible] WHAT HAPPENS? IF AND WHEN THE FIRE HAPPENED. OCCURS LEADERS IN THE FUTURE. A WE THINK THAT SOLAR PANELS AND AND BATTERIES ARE SOLD FOR A POTENTIAL SOLUTION AND CAN GIVE. THESE HOMEOWNERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES -- CONSISTENT OF PROVISION OF ELECTRICITY SOME REAL BILL POSSIBLE THANK YOU. AS COUNSEL ALSO REGRETTABLY OPPOSE WE APPRECIATE THE NARROWING AMENDMENTS BUT ARE CONCERNED THAT THE SUCH ABOUT PRESIDENT. OF PARTICULARLY AROUND COST SAVINGS -- AND WE ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO RECONSIDER THANK YOU. OKAY SO -- WILL HAVE A WILL COME TO DISCUSSION NOW CENTER WIENER. BUT I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN -- SO OF THE OTHER I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD I KNOW YOU HAVE. ONLY. THE BEST OF INTENTIONS AND TRYING -- TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO FACILITATE RESULTING IN YOUR DISTRICT I COMPLETELY RESPECT THAT. I'M JUST SO YOU KNOW WHERE I'M COMING FROM LAST YEAR -- AUTHORED THE LEGISLATION AND SAN FRANCISCO TO REQUIRE A SOLAR AND I I SEE THIS COMMITTEE PASSED A BILL I AUTHORED TWO YEARS AGO I SEE -- SEVENTY ONE TO TAKE THAT ARE REQUIREMENTS STATEWIDE WE BACKED OFF ONCE THE ENERGY COMMISSION WAS WORKING ON AND THEY ULTIMATELY ADOPTED WHAT THEY ADOPTED. AND I HI. I UNDERSTAND OF THE GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATION I ALSO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS -- BUT TO ME FIRST OF ALL IT. ON THE LEGISLATION AND PROMOTES A NARRATIVE THAT I JUST. DON'T AGREE WITH ABOUT CLASSIFYING SOLAR AS AN EX AS SOMETHING THAT MAKES HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE WHICH I DON'T THINK -- IS ACCURATE -- ALL THE THERE ARE YOU KNOW NOT ONLY ARE THERE DIFFERENT WAYS OF ACTUALLY GETTING SOLAR ON TO THE ROOF -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO HONOR YOURSELF FOR EXAMPLE -- BUT OVER TIME OF COURSE IT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES COSTS -- BY CONTRAST -- ENDLESS EXPANSIONS OF THE GRID -- ARE VERY COSTLY TO OUR HOMEOWNERS INTO ANYONE IS PAYING. A LECTURE BILL IN ADDITION THE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THE THE TRANSMISSION WIRES ARE HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE. OF A NUMBER OF THESE -- MAGNIFIERS I'M AND SO THAT YOU WITH THESE FIRES HAVE POINTED TO THE NEED. TO MOVE EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVELY AND THE DIRECTION OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES -- NOT LESS SO SO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS BUT I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY [inaudible] CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SO THERE ARE. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT -- SAVING MONEY IT'S ABOUT SAVING LIVES -- AND THAT'S WHAT. OUR FOLKS HAVE BEEN THROUGH TOO MANY TIMES AND THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT KIDS OF PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH FIRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I I APPRECIATE THAT. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE [inaudible] VERY STE [inaudible] SENSITIVE AND FOCUS CONVERSATION OF PEOPLE LIVE BELOW MEDIAN INCOME LEVELS IN THESE COMMUNITIES SO I'M LOOKING AT LA COUNTY BY THE WAY RIGHT NOW WE WERE TALKING EARLIER -- DOLLARS SO. THOSE FAMILIES IN THE WALLS THE FIRE FALL OT. AND I'M THINKING OF AREAS LIKE CENTER RUBIO IS BEEN TO AND SEMINAL SPRINGS AND THOSE ARE THE TARGET POPULATIONS. THE KEY THAT. KEY POINT HERE FOR ME IS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE BUILDING THAT RESILIENCY INTO THESE AREAS SO THAT THOSE PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT. TO FROM AGREED THAT WILL STAY ONLINE SO FOR THE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN THIS COMMITTEE YOU KNOW THE FOR THE PEOPLE ON RESPIRATORS PEOPLE IN NURSING ASSISTED FACILITIES -- FOLKS WHO ARE IN POVERTY. I'M I WAS SICK A RUNNING PICKUP TRUCK LINES FOR THE DIESEL TO GET THEM BACK ON LINE -- THAT DOESN'T WORK IN A FIRE AND I THINK SOLAR AND STORAGE OR MICRO GRADES OR FUEL CELLS ARE OTHER SMART DISTRIBUTED GENERATION IN THESE COMMUNITIES IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR RURAL COUNTIES. AND I DON'T KNOW OF THESE BILLS THE RIGHT VENUE NECESSARILY DID. TO TO GET US READY FOR PS PS FOR REAL -- I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT SORT OF AN AND THERE WERE SLICE OF THE QUESTION BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN BE NARAL RIGHT NOW I GET YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE A TITLE. TWENTY FOUR ISSUE YOU SEE ISRAEL AND A COST ISSUE AND I KNOW THERE'S ACTUALLY SMART ECONOMICS IS A ON GOING IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAPER [inaudible] BUT I I WOULD JUST WE WE'VE GOT AS A LEGISLATURE I THINK THIS YEAR HAVE THAT FIGURE CONVERSATION BACKWARD RESILIENCY SO I JUST. FOR RURAL COUNTIES OR FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE I MEAN. DO YOU SEE A ROLE FOR TITLE TWENTY FOUR OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM. TO THAT THESE CUSTOMERS JUST LIKE THE FOLKS TO YOU KNOW HAVE MORE INCOME ARE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SAME BACK UP POWER IN THAT SAME RESILIENCY WHEN A DISASTERHIT. BECAUSE I MEAN YOLO IS OFF LAST WEEK AND SKY FOR WOOD SANTA CLARITA AT OUT LAST WEEK -- IT'S BAD SO I DO YOU MIND WHAT JUST. WEIGHING IN ON IT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING THERE. ABSOLUTELY -- PROJECT QUESTION. OR STOP -- YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THE THE DESIGN OF THIS BILL IS -- IT I WANT I WANT THOSE CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE THE MEANS. TO BE ABLE TO PUT SOLAR IF THEY CHOOSE RIGHT EVEN AND THEY HAVE THIS MEANS IF THERE'S IF THEIR CREDIT WORTHY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE. TO FINANCE OUT INPUT CELERON THERE'S ALL KINDS OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THEM. THIS IS THIS IS FOCUSED AT FOLKS WHO JUST WENT THROUGH IT AND HOW TO DISASTER WHO. ARE TRAUMATIZED FIRST OF ALL NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GO THROUGH THE BUILDING PROCESS. AND OVER THREE THEIR POOR PEOPLE. SO THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO HELP THOSE DOWNTRODDEN POOR PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE THE MEANS AND THE WILL AND THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PUSH ALL ON BY ALL MEANS WE WOULD WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT. ALSO I AM ALL OF YOU KNOW EXCITED ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S COMING OUT AND STE BATTERY STORAGE I DON'T THINK WERE. WERE TOTALLY THERE YET ON I THINK BUT THE TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND BUT THAT'S THAT'S GONNA BE SOME TIME OUT I'M TRYING TO FOCUS ON HELPING THOSE. PEOPLE THAT ARE BELOW THE MEDIAN INCOME I WILL GET BACK IN THEIR HOME THAT THEY JUST LOST AND IF YOU KNEW THESE PEOPLE LOOK THEM IN THE EYE AND AND THE UNDERSTAND THE MOUNTAIN OF THINGS THAT THEY ARE NEVER DEALT WITH. TRYING TO GET A PERMIT AND TRYING TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES I THINK YOU WOULD. UNDERSTAND THE BILL FOR THIS BILL I DO SO. SO YEAH SO MY POINT IS IS THAT LOOK. IT IS MAY NOT BE A PERFECT BILL IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE GRID AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAD WE WE NEED TO DO I'LL BE MORE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. WE ALSO IN SOME AREAS WE OVER PRODUCE SOLAR IN IN IT WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE DOT CURVE AND YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME PLACES WE WE SHOULD MAYBE. NOT LOOK AT SOLAR LOOK AT OTHER ALTERNATIVES -- BECAUSE OF PUTTING SOLAR THERE AND WE NEED TO DO STORAGE IS THE I THINK THE KEY HERE WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON STORAGE BUT THIS BILL IS NOT FOCUS ON THIS THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON PEOPLE WHO JUST LOST. LOVED ONES AND WHO ARE. AT VERY LOW -- WAGE AND NEED TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL FOCUSED AT NO I I KNOW THEM. TOO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP TAKE THEM OUT OF THE MUCK MYSELF AND AND MY BIG CONCERN IS THAT THEIR PASSIVE IN THE HOMEBUILDING PROCESS LIKE WHEN YOU OWN A MOBILE HOME. YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF SAY SO IN WHAT THAT THING LOOKS LIKE COMING BACK. AND THAT DEVELOPERS NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A LOT OF OPTIONS SO EVEN IF THEY COULD BUILD A PACKAGE THAT LOOKED. IDENTICAL TO LIKE WITH WITH SOME BACK UP POWER MAYBE SOME SOLAR MAYBE A BATTERY MAYBE SOME OTHER RESOURCE AND WITHOUT. THEY COULD ACTUALLY PROBABLY GET YOU THAT HOME FOR THE SAME SAME COSTS BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT THE DEVELOPER DOESN'T SO MY CONCERN IS IF WE IF WERE. STAY IF WE'RE SAYING FORGET TITLE TWENTY FOUR THEN WE'RE GONNA JUST TELL DEVELOPERS LIKE YOU KNOW JUST THROW WHATEVER JUST THROW IT BACK IN THERE AND THEN THESE PEOPLE GOING TO BE STUCK AGAIN. THANK OSTER SO I'M A YOU KNOW I'M. I'M I'M I'M I'M HUNG UP ON IT AND I AND I I WANT I WANT TO SEE YOU KEEP MOVING WITH THIS BILL HERE BUT I WE'VE GOT TO WRESTLE WITH THAT ISSUE AND I DON'T THINK SOLAR'S THE PROBLEM I THINK IS PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE. THANK YOU CENTER SIR CENTER BRAD FOR FULL LISTENERS. THANK YOU I I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR THIS MEASURE IT TO COMMONSENSE MEASURE. ALL WE TALK ABOUT THE FORD ABILITY OF HOUSING ON A DAILY BASIS IN THIS LEGISLATURE. AND I'VE TALKED TO REALTORS AS WELL AS I ATTENDED A HOMEOWNERS -- ASSOCIATION MINUTE MEETING LAST THURSDAY MY DISTRICT AND THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN SELLING NEW HOMES IS ADDITIONAL CUTS AFFORDABILITY. AND NOW THE DISH NO COST OF ADDING SOLAR TO NEW CONSTRUCTION ADDS THIRTY TO FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION ARI FOR FOLKS THAT CAN AFFORD HOMES. SO THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES WE'VE HEARD TIME AND TIME -- IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. FROM RESIDENT. WHOSE BIGGEST CONCERN IS REBUILDING AND ERRORS ARE WHERE THE THEY LEFT BUILDING THE SAME STRUCTURE AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO DO IT. JUST WHAT OUT THE SOLAR AND NOW YOU ADD THAT ADDITIONAL COST SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT NOT BEING ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU KNOW. NOT CARING ABOUT -- RENEWABLE ENERGY THIS IS ABOUT ALLOWING FOLKS TO GET BACK IN A HOME AT AFFORDABLE RATES YOU TALK TO REALTORS AND THIS IS THE HARDEST HOME TO SAIL ON THE MARKET TODAY IS HOMES WITH SOLAR. AND WE NEED TO HAVE GROWN UP CONVERSATIONS AND AND AND AND AND AND LOOK AT WORK WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME. THIS DOES NOT HELP FOLKS GET BACK INTO THEIR HOMES WE SHOULD HELP FOLKS WHATEVER MEANS POSSIBLE TO GET BACK IN THEIR HOMES YOU TALK THE BUILDING ASSOCIATION. THE MANDATORY SOLAR BILL HOUSE COST. HOME PRICES TO GO UP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS NOT MADE IT MORE AFFORDABLE WE HAVE MORE FOLKS HOMES TODAY AND THIS WILL ONLY OUT TO THE HOMES FROM. CENTER STONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO STRONGLY ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH MY GOOD FRIEND SENATOR BRADFORD FROM LOS ANGELES WHO SPENT AS LIFE -- DEALING WITH -- ELECTRICITY AND PROVIDING UTILITIES WE WE HAVE -- ABOUT THE HIGHEST MEDIAN HOME PRICE PRACTICALLY IN THE COUNTRY AT FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- THIS IS JUST -- ANOTHER INSULT IF YOU WILL OF THE PEOPLE THAT -- NEVER EXPECTED TO WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND NOT FIND THEIR HOUSE STANDING -- THEY'RE STILL POST TRAUMATIC SHOCK I WOULD BE IN SHOCK IF I LOST MY HOUSE AND YOU KNOW YOU YOU NEVER REALIZE -- THE THE VALUE OF YOUR INSURANCE AND TELL YOU HAVE TO DEPEND ON EXERCISING YOUR INSURANCE POLICY AND A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN PREMIUMS IS. REPLACEMENT COST A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK A REPLACEMENT COST WHEN THEY WHEN THEY LOOK AT THEIR FIRE INSURANCE I JUST WANT TO LOOK AT THE LOWEST PREMIUM THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND AND GETS ADDED TO THEIR THEIR THEIR HOUSE PAYMENT THEIR PROPERTY TAXES IF THEY'RE IMPOUNDED. AND THIS IS JUST A VERY NARROW WINDOW THAT TO ME SHOWS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE THAT HASGOT SOME OF THE STRONGEST ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS OF ANY STATE OF ALMOST ANY COUNTRY PROBABLY IN THE WORLD -- WAS SHOWING A LITTLE EMPATHY AND COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE LOST EVERYTHING [inaudible] AND CERTAINLY THOSE THAT WANT TO EXERCISE THE OPTION AND HAVE THE ABILITY. TO PLACE THE COSTS OF SOLAR INTO THEIR THEIR HOMES THAT IS STILL -- AN OPTION FOR THEM BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA BE WAITING TWO THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS BEFORE THEY EVER GET THEIR HOMES REBUILT AGAIN AND THIS IS JUST ONE OBSTACLE THE WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUT OF THE WAY TO TIME WE OVER GENERATE SOLAR. ENERGY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE PROVIDE FREE SOLAR -- ENERGY DERIVED -- ENERGY TO TWO OTHER STATES BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME PLACE -- SENATOR CHRIS ALL WELCOME TO THE SENATE. TWO THANK YOU FOR THIS AWFUL BILL. AND HI I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE IT AND AND LET'S SHOW THAT WE HAVE COMPASSION AND EMPATHY FOR THESE CITIZENS OF LOST EVERYTHING. SERRA RUPIAH [inaudible] THANK YOU. WHAT I WANT TO DISMISS YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUES -- MISTER WEINER AND STERN I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE THAT DIRECTION BUT I ALSO AGREE WITH MISTER BRADFORD YOU KNOW WE COME FROM SIMILAR COMMUNITIES AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE STRUGGLING TO GET PEOPLE BACK IN HOMES JUST IN GENERAL. BUT THIS FOR ME AS A PARTICULAR CASE AND PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO REBUILD IT'S IN MY VIEW A LITTLE BIT NARROWER. AND I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE MOMENT THAT YOU TOOK I THINK THAT -- WE NEED TO HAVE THAT COMPASSION AT THIS POINT WE WE WANT TO HELP THESE PEOPLE TO GET BACK INTO HOMES AND SO I DON'T WANT TO BE DISMISSIVE OF ANYBODY'S COMMENTS HERE BECAUSE I THINK WE'LL HAVE VALID. POINTS AND I THINK WE ALL CARE VERY MCH ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT I CAN I THINK THIS IS JUST GOING TO HELP THESE FOLKS BACK INTO HOMES AND AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU AN AGAIN I THINK THIS BILL IS ABOUT SHOWING COMPASSION UNDERSTANDING HELPING PEOPLE RESERVE -- REBUILD. AND AND IN THAT REGARD I I I SUPPORTED -- BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS BILL NOT SOLVING THE ENTIRE PROBLEM. I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- WHEN THE ENERGY COMMISSION CAME OUT WITH ITS MANDATE REQUIRING SOLAR AND EVERY NEW HOME? YOU KNOW I I I STRUGGLED WITH THAT DECISION. ON THE BASIS OF THE FACT THAT -- CURRENTLY OUR NAME RATES. OUR OUR OUR CAN BE FOUR FIVE TIMES HIGHER. THEN -- PROCURING -- SOLAR. FROM A SOLAR FARM. EN EN WHEN YOU MAKE A DECISION LIKE THAT REQUIRE AN ALL NEW CONSTRUCTION HAVE SOLAR. WHAT IS THAT GONNA DUE TO RATES IN OUR STATE? THEY MADE A DECISION. INDEPENDENT OF THAT WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE COST SHIFT IT'S GOING TO TAKE PLACE. AND THE IMBALANCE THAT IT'S GOING TO CREATE ON THE DEPTH CHART. AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I THINK NEED TO BE. ARE DISCUSSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. WE NEED A MAN ENSURE THAT THERE ISN'T A COST SHIFT TAKING PLACE. THAT'S GONNA AND SOLD. WHAT WITH THIS BILL WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE? UP POORER OR LET LOWER INCOME HOMEOWNERS A REPRIEVE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME -- BY NOT APPROVING THIS BILL WHAT WERE PASSING COST -- TO OF PEOPLE THAT ARE. THAT ARE ARE ARE POOR IN THE COMMUNITY THAT CAN AFFORD SO LEARN I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF SO FAR WE'RE NOT GIVEN AWAY SOLAR. BUT EVEN IF WE DID. IT ADDED IT IT IT RESULTS IN A COST SHIFT IN RATES THAT'S A THAT'S THAT CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO SPECIFIC PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SOLAR. OR OR OR CAN'T GET A FREE SOLAR PANEL EVEN IF. YOU SAY WELL IS THAT DOES IT WON'T COST YOU ANYTHING I GUESS THIS I GUESS PEOPLE THAT SAY IT DOESN'T COST YOU IN ANYTHING DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF GOING INTO DEBT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF OF OF OF IN SOMETHING. AND I'M HOW MUCH HOW MANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GOING TO BE PUT INTO OUR COMMUNITY. THEY'RE ALSO GONNA RESULT IN AN INCREASE LIABILITY TO THE TWO IF THE BURNED AGAIN WE HAVE TO NOT ONLY REPLACE THE HOME BUT THE IMPROVEMENTS. AND AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE IT ADDRESS THE LIABILITY ISSUE IN THAT AT A TIME WE HAVE AN ADDRESS THE BALANCING ISSUE. AND A TIME THAT WE HAVE AN ADDRESS TO COST YOU FIFTY ISSUE. WE HAVE A A ALL ALL FULL OF MANDATE I AM I HAVE. ENORMOUS CONCERNS OF THAT I THINK THIS BILL I DON'T WANT TO THROW THIS BILL INTO THAT DEBATE. BECAUSE I THINK IT SEPARATE THIS IS A SEPARATE ISSUE. ALL I'M SAYING IS THERE A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES TO CONSIDER IN THIS BALANCE. AND I THINK THIS BILL SHOULD MOVE FORWARD I THINK IT'S A A GOOD GESTURE. ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATURE TO SHOW SUPPORT. FOR THE PEOPLE. IN OUR STATE THAT HAVE BEEN HIT HARD HIT THAT OF LEST LOST EVERYTHING. AND WE'RE JUST SAYINGYOU HAVE ONE LESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT. AND LET US WORRY ABOUT. FIGHTING YOU AFFORDABLE SAFE ELECTRICITY. THROUGH THE OTHER MEANS THAT WE HAVE BY FOR CARRYING IT AT A CHEAPER RATE. THROUGH OF THE LARGER DEVELOPMENTS THAT COULD PROVOKE PROVOKE PRODUCE SOLAR AT YOU FOR RACHEL. WE STILL ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I DON'T THINK THIS. UNDOING THIS. MAKES IT HARDER FOR THE STATE TO ACHIEVE OUR OUR GOALS TO GET UP TO A 100% WE CAN STILL PROCURE CLEAN POWER FROM -- A VERY BROAD AND DIVERSE SET OF OF REACH OF OF OF SOURCES SO. YOU KNOW I APPLAUD YOU FOR LOOKING OUT FOR THE PEOPLE OF YOUR COMMUNITY I KNOW YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT I'VE. SEEN YOU SITTING COMMITTEE. ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND AND AND TAKE THE THE THE MOST PROPER COURSE OF ACTION TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF YOUR COMMUNITY AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT. AND THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ASK THAT OUR COLLEAGUES. SUPPORTED AS WELL. OF WE'RE GOING TO CALL THE VOTE NOW WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR STONE. DO YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS [inaudible] WHAT? YOUR SUPPORT BUT I WOULD JUST WANNA SAY -- SO I AS MANY KNOW I JUST REALLY CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT I'VE I'VE CHAMPIONED ALL KINDS OF LEGISLATION. TO TALK ABOUT THE MISSION OF CARBONS AND WHERE THEY COME FROM IN IN FORESTRY IN THOSE ISSUES IN WATERSHEDS AND AND THIS IS A NO BILL NYE I WOULD I SET FOR MANY YEARS ON THE UTILITIES COMMITTEE IN THE OTHER HOUSE AND TALKED ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND I'M I I'M. AT THE TABLE WHEN YOU GUYS WANNA TALK WHEN WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE OTHER ISSUES BUT THIS BILL. IS REALLY NOW THIS IS THEY KNOW A LOT OF THE FOLKS ALL TO SHARE WITH YOU SOMETHING THAT I I'VE TALKED TO THESE FOLKS THAT ARE TRYING TO REBUILD. A LOT OF AN EASY WHEN YOU DON'T REBUILD YOU DON'T GET AS MUCH FROM YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY IF YOU'RE INSURED. BUT IN MANY CASES THEY'RE TAKING THAT MONEY AND THEY'RE GOING TO ANOTHER STATE. AND THEY'RE ABLE TO REBUILD THEIR AND YOU KNOW I I GET IT OPPOSED BY A LOT OF THE ENVIRONMENT COMMUNITY ON MOST MY PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND IT IT'S IT'S BAFFLING WE UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES WHY.

NINETY SEVEN OVER FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE SOME LEVEL OF DISABILITY. THAT INHIBIT THEIR ABILITY TO USE TELEPHONE DUE TO DIFFICULT SEEING HEARING SPEAKING MOVING OR LEARNING. OR SLASH REMEMBER. FOR FORTY YEARS THE CALIFORNIA DEAF AND DISABLED COMMUNITY TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED CRITICAL EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES. TO SUCH INDIVIDUALS IN ORDER TO HELP THEM COMMUNICATE WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD. THE PROGRAM IS OVERSEEN BY THE CPC AND IS OMPOSED OF THREE SEPARATE PROGRAMS. IT INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA TELEPHONE ACCESS PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT. TO QUALIFY PARTICIPANTS THE CALIFORNIA REAP RELAY SERVICE. WHICH ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO COMMUNICATE BY DIALING 711- AND THE SPEECH GENERATING. DEVICES PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED AND COMPLEX COMMUNICATING SERVER COMMUNICATING DEVICES THE INDIVIDUALS WITH SPEECH TO DISABILITIES. THE R. C. IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT A BEFORE.

I AM ONE OF THE ORIGINAL FOLKS THAT WAS INVOLVED WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEAF TRUSTS. THAT HASN'T BEEN LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PROGRAM FOR THE DEAF AND DISABLED TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM. SO YOUR SUPPORT MEANS A LOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. GOOD MORNING THERESA ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF THE ARE CAN YOU SEE P. CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT. JANUARY TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. NUMBERS ANYBODY IN THE DID YOU WANNA. DID YOU WANT ME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF SOMEONE SANTIAGO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- YOU KNOW I'M I'M ONE THAT -- USUALLY IS A VERY MUCH AN ANTI TAX GUY -- BUT THIS IS AN EXISTING TAX THAT I HAVE SEEN HAVE TREMENDOUS BENEFICIAL -- AFFECTS AND IN MY COMMUNITY NOT ONLY WITH MY CONSTITUENTS BUT EVEN MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY -- WE HAVE A REMARKABLE INCIDENTS OF AUTISM NOW THEY SAY IT'S ONE IN THIRTY FIVE NOW -- THESE ARE FOLKS THAT -- ARE GOING TO HAVE COGNITIVE DISABILITIES THAT ARE GONNA BE NEEDING THIS TYPE OF A SERVICE. AND SO THE ONLY QUESTION AND I REALLY HAVE FOR YOU IS IS WHY WHY DO WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A SUNSET ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM THESE. COGNITIVE DIFFICULTIES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ON UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HOPEFULLY IT WILL HAVE SOME MEDICAL ADVANCES THAT WILL MITIGATE THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING ANYTIME IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. OR SEVEN YEARS IS THERE IS A REASON WHY WE HAVE A SENSE AT ALL A WE WERE JUST REQUEST TO HAVE A CENTER THAT WAS NO OTHER REASON I MEAN I I I WOULD AGREE. SO -- NOT BY ME NO IDEA. OF WHAT WAS AT A CONDITION OF ANOTHER COMMITTEE OR YOU KNOW WHAT LET LET ME DO THIS LET LET ME -- LET ME GO BACK AND TALK. TO PART OF ME TEARS AS HE THERE'S ANYBODY TO CHANGE THAT BUT I MEAN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE YEAH YOU SHOULD BE AND I DON'T KNOW IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY THAT. IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY THAT THE PC DOES NOT NEED. TO AND I WANT TO SAY THIS FOR THE RECORD I SHOULD SAID THIS EARLIER THE PC DOES NOT HAVE TO COLLECT UP TO THAT AMOUNT -- THE POINT FIVE DAY COULD ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT SO THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE AS WELL -- BUT I THINK I THINK ALSO SOMETIMES A THE SUNSETS ARE ARE DONE SO THAT WE COULD TAKE A LOOK BACK AT A PROGRAM -- IN IN RE VISIT THOSE OF THOSE AMOUNTS OF DOLLARS AS WELL THAT'S NOT MY INTENT BUT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A NUMBER OF REASONS I FIGURED I WOULD BOTH AGREE THAT -- THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS PROGRAM IT HAS NOTHING BUT IN A BENEFICIAL ACTORS BEEN NO CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE SPENDING OF THE MONEY HAS BEEN GOING TO THE APPROPRIATE SOURCE. I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING A FORWARD BUT IF THERE'S A WAY TO ELIMINATE THAT I WOULD CERTAINLY -- APPRECIATE THAT BUT I'M HAPPIEST PORTUGAL TODAY IT'S CENTER MARLON. YOUNG RESEARCHER -- MISTER MISTER SANTIAGO MAYBE I'LL TAKE IT FROM THE OTHER SIDE YOU KNOW WHY EVEN. WHY NOT HAVE A SUNSET WHY NOT JUST GET IT OVER WITH -- AND MAYBE ASK [inaudible] HAS HASN'T. THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND THE CPUC DEVELOPED ENOUGH APPLICATIONS. TEXTING OPPORTUNITIES FACETIME OPPORTUNITIES. TO TO IN A SENSE WORK ITSELF OUT [inaudible] OR WHY WOULD WE NEED TO KEEP. YOUR BABY TAKE THE OTHER SIDE OF IT JUST SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HONEST IMPORTANT AGO MISTER CHAIRMAN. YES AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OF THE BACK AND FORTH OF OF POLICY CONVERSATIONS THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT I CAN APPRECIATE THAT. HERE'S ONE THING. WHEN I TOOK A LOOK AT SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND I TO THE TIME TO GO SEE IT REVIEW IT AND YOU LOOK AT HOW TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED I MEAN WE WOULDN'T WANT TO LIMIT -- WHAT WE THINK IS THE BEST -- THE BEST EQUIPMENT NOW WHEN SOMETHING BETTER CAN COME DOWN THE FUTURE SO YOU WOULD NEED TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT -- THOSE DOLLARS THE THE THE OTHER QUOTE THE OTHER ISSUE TOO IS THAT -- I HOPE IT'S NOT THE CASE BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT TRADITIONALLY IT HAS BEEN THAT THE POPULATION WHO NEED THESE SERVICES GROW GROWS -- AND SO YOU WOULD WANT TO LIMIT IT LIMITED BECAUSE FUTURE GENERATIONS -- MAY NEED A BIGGER POLE -- OF MONEY OR MAY NEED NEW EQUIPMENT AND SO FORTH -- IT'S WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I SAY THAT WE ACTUALLY MAY HAVE A MORE THAN EATING NOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT SORTS OF POPULATIONS WITH DIFFERENT SORTS OF DISABILITIES AND OR NEEDS OR CONDITIONS -- IT PAINS ME TO SAY THAT AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE WOULDN'T WANT TO LIMIT IT. THE DATA A SUNSET A DAY IN NO MORE MONIES DOWN THE LINE -- FOR PROGRAM HAS HAD GREAT BENEFITS I MET UP I'M PUSHING BACK ON YOU FOR THE PURPOSES OF POLICY ARGUMENTS. SO DO YOU THINK THE CPUC HAS BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB BEING INNOVATIVE BEING. COST EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT OR OR HAS IT IS IT IS IT THE RIGHT HOME FOR A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. WHAT'S THE HOME THAT WITH THAT'S THE HOME THAT EXIST IN NOW -- SO WITH WE TOOK THE LENS OF LOOKING AT WOULD TO WHERE THE PROGRAM EXIST AND HOW TO CONTINUE THE THIS -- VALUABLE SERVICE OFFER INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED IT -- I DON'T TAKE ANY OTHER LENDER MAY BE HAPPY. TO SIT DOWN AND GO BACK AND FORTH BUT BUT AS OF AS THE BILL CURRENTLY STANDS AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE IT -- CONTINUE MOVING IT FORWARD THIS IS THE AUTHORITY THAT CURRENTLY HAS HAS THE PROGRAM SO IT'S WERE WERE.

PICTURE MEMBERS MIKE MONICA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LEXICAL WORKERS AS SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. MODEST COMMONSENSE WE AS FREE ABOUT. THANK YOU ARE YOU HAVE ANYBODY ELSE IN THE PUBLIC LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR AN OPPOSITION. MORE COMMON BE OFFICER CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT ANYONE ELSE. THIS IS A PROBLEM BERMAN BILL -- CENTER SOME YEAH JUST A QUICK QUESTION HAS AS IT BEEN SOME EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES OF THIS ARE HAPPENING IN THE PAST THAT -- HAS DISSIPATED THIS BILL. ON AND I LOVE THE ON SPONSORED WE DO KNOW OF SOME SOME ACTIVITY BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THOUGH IS. THAT THE ATTEMPT IS BILLS TO PRESERVE THE MAKE SURE THAT REPAIR DOLLARS ARE NOT USED TO THAT. IN FAIRNESS -- I AFFAIRS CLOSED IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT -- INVESTOR DOLLARS CAN BE USED TO PRIVATE DOLLARS BUT AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR YOUR HARDER MONEY OR MY HARD EARNED MONEY. ONE WAY OR THE OTHER NO MATTER HOW DIFFERENT OR EQUALLY WE FEEL ABOUT ABOUT -- UNION. THERE'S BEEN AN EXAMPLE. SICKNESS ESTATE OF THIS BILL. WE WENT A BILL A COUPLE YEARS AGO BY DUST WILLIAMS AND ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUE -- BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME ACTIVITY IN ONE OF THE AYE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. USING REPAIR FUNDS -- AND WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS RIGHT THEY DECIDE ONCE THEY SAW THE BILL THAT WAS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO NOT DO IT ANYMORE. WE PROBABLY SHOULD PUSH THAT BILL THEN BUT WE WAITED AND WE HAVE NOW. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH MR HERE. YES SIR IT IN THANK YOU FOR THAT AND IN THAT EXPLAINED MY QUESTION -- THE QUESTION I HAD THE INFORMATION AS TO WHAT THE MOTIVATION WAS WITH THE CONCERN WAS WITH THE ISSUE FOR THE PERHAPS. UGH BECAUSE THIS IS WILL BE COMING TO THE LABOR COMMITTEE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT THE BOOKS GOOD THANK YOU. YOU KNOW I'LL TELL YOU WHY THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH WHAT THAT WORK WITH THE STATE -- AND THE WILD FIRES. EVER EVERY -- RATE PAYER DOLLARS SCRUTINIZED AND AND HOUSE -- A RE REASON WHY IT'S APPROVED -- MANY AND MANY CASES THE THE UTILITIES MAKE A CASE THAT THEY WANT MORE REPAIR FUNDS IN THE UC TRIES. TO BALANCE. THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. AND AND AND AND KEEPING RATES LOW. AND A LOT OF THESE UTILITIES ARGUED THAT THE PC DOESN'T GIVE THEM ENOUGH MONEY TO INVEST IN. IN IN IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN -- TO PREVENT IN -- FIRES. AND SO WHEN WHEN THEY'RE USING MONEY THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY ALLOCATED. TO RUN THE UTILITY TO MAKE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND CRANE EFFICIENCIES AND AND SAFETIES. AND THEN THEY'RE USING THAT MONEY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES IS JUST NOT. I I THINK IT'S A MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS AND I THINK. A BILL LIKE THIS NEEDS TO CALM WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT SANCTIONS. BECAUSE IT IS IS IT REALLY IS -- ABOUT USING MONEY THAT'S INTENDED FOR ONE PURPOSE. FOR A POLITICAL PURPOSE. THAT IS -- DISINGENUOUS IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE IT'S NOT IN THE PUBLIC FOR THE PUBLIC'S BENEFIT. AND A IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS AUTHORIZED. BY BY THE P. YOU SEE. ALSO THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL AND I AND I URGE MY MY OF COLLEAGUES TO VOTE FOR IT IT'S HIS. THIS IS ABOUT -- KEEPING PEOPLE -- ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT THEIR MISSION IS TO PROVIDE A CHEAP RELIABLE POWER SAY IN A SAFE FASHION TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE.

TWENTY TWENTY ONE REAL TIME TEXT IS A TEXT TRANSMITTED INSTANTLY. AS IT IS BEING TYPE TO RECIPIENTS CAN IMMEDIATELY READ THE MESSAGE WITHOUT WAITING. THIS BILL WOULD BENEFIT THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITY BY PROVIDING EQUAL ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO TV WISE OR VIDEO RELAY SERVICES. IN CALIFORNIA TT WISE AND VIDEO RELAY SERVICES ARE THE WAYS OF COMMUNICATING WITH EMERGENCY DISPATCHERS WHEN IN NEED OF HELP FOR THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITY. VIDEO RELAY SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE THROUGH A THIRD PARTY IT ALLOWS THE INTERPRETER TO SEE THE CALLER BUT THE ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE IS SOMETIMES DELAYED DUE TO TRANSLATION. VERSUS A DIRECTX MESSAGE AS NEW TECHNOLOGY KEEPS ADVANCING PT WISE AND VIDEO RELAY SERVICES ARE NOT THE MOST ACCESSIBLE FORM OF COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITY JUST LIKE PEOPLE IN GENERAL THEY ARE RELYING ON INSTANT MESSAGNG TEXT MESSAGING EMAIL. OR VIDEO COMMUNICATION THROUGH SMART PHONES OR COMPUTERS SAN MATTEO IN SACRAMENTO ARE AMONG THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED TAXES AND NINE ONE ONE TECHNOLOGY ALLOWING. ITS CITIZENS TO REACH AN EMERGENCY DISPATCH WHEN IT'S ON SAFE RUN FEASIBLE THE CALL.

WE CURRENTLY HAVE SMS YOU KNOW THE REAL TIME TEXT [inaudible] AND SO. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY FOR ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I ALSO FORGOT TO MENTION.

HAS AND HAS ENOUGH VOTES WILL HOLD THE ROLE OF PRESCRIPTION MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL THE TWO WHICH WILL HELP CRACKDOWN ON CALLER ID FRAUD AND SPAM CALLS. AS FAR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS KNOW THESE ABUSIVE PRACTICES HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS AND POSE SERIOUS RISKS TO CONSUMERS. IN RECENT YEARS FRAUDSTERS HAVE SOUGHT TO SPOOF THE PHONE NUMBERS OF LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. SPOOFING A GOVERNMENT AGENCY PHONE NUMBER CAN BE PARTICULARLY HARMFUL TO LOW INCOME CONSUMERS AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHO MAY HAVE MORE REGULAR CONTACT WITH. AND RELIANCE UPON GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND OFFICES. MALICIOUS CALL CALL SPOOFING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ALSO UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF STATE AGENCIES. FACILITATE FRAUD BY EXPLOITING STATE AUTHORITY AND REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THE LEGITIMATE CALLS FROM THOSE AGENCIES WILL BE ANSWERED IN THE FUTURE WHEN THEY COULD BE NEEDED TO INFORM RESIDENTS OF EMERGENCIES OR OTHER ESSENTIAL INFORMATION. AB ELEVEN THIRTY TWO WILL BUILD UPON FEDERAL LAW TO HELP INCREASE ENFORCEMENT STRENGTH AND STATE LEVEL PENALTIES AND AND THESE ABUSIVE PRACTICES. THE BILL RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY HAS NO OPPOSITION AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK.

OF THE LIST OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO CRACKDOWN ON THIS WE'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS -- WITH A NOTICES THERE HAS BEEN AN UP TICK ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS -- ON THESE CALLS -- INDICAN ARIZONA IT WAS UP TO ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT MILLION CALLS -- OVER LIKE A THREE WEEK PERIOD THAT THEY STUDIED IT'S BEEN ON AND ON THIS VERSION OF COLOR ID SPOOFING IS PARTICULARLY PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC -- BECAUSE THEY ARE SPOON FEEDING AS THE AUTHOR INDICATED A LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A CONSUMER HEARING. SACRAMENTO RECIEVE ON BACK TO BACK DAYS A CALLER ID ON THEIR HOME PHONE LANDLINE COOPER LAND LINE -- DID THAT SAID CITY OF SACRAMENTO AS WHERE THE CALL WAS COMING FROM AND THEN ANOTHER ONE THE NEXT DAY THAT SAID THE A SACRAMENTO COUNTY AIRPORT -- IT'S BEEN ONGOING THERE'S ALSO BEEN REPORTS THAT RANCHO CORDOVA POLICE DEPARTMENT -- SAN DIEGO SHERIFF -- IT'S BEEN ON AN ON OFF FOR THESE PARTICULAR CALLS IT WAS A BUSINESS -- THAT WAS SELLING I THINK HOME WARRANTIES -- I THINK THERE WAS ANOTHER THE SOLAR INSTALLATION SO THIS IS BECOME -- A ONGOING PRACTICE OF BUSINESSES AND SO THERE THIS IS A WAY TO CRACK DOWN -- APPRECIATE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS AND PROJECT THE AUTHOR I TAKING ON THIS BILL AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

WELL WE HAVE SIX WAS RIGHT SIX ONE SEVEN SEVEN PROBABLY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. GOOD MORNING. WELCOME. ON A. B.. ELEVEN FORTY FOUR THANK YOU TO OUR WEST SO FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS -- AND FOR FINALIZING THEM IT REALLY HELP THE BILL A LOT WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO BE FACING A LOT MORE DE ENERGIZING A POWER LINES TO THE WILD FIRE RISK. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS TO SHIFT -- A PERCENTAGE OF OUR S. CHIP ARE URBAN -- SELF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM FUNDS. BOB. INTO A FUND THAT WOULD WORK ON SOLAR PROJECTS TO HELP WITH CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN THESE PARTICULAR AREAS SO 10% OF THE S. CHIP FUNDS WOULD BE DEDICATED. FOR RESILIENCY EFFORTS FOR AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE DANTE ENERGIZING LINES FOR THINGS LIKE FIRE STATIONS AND SCHOOLS AND OTHER -- CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THE INS AND CENTER FUNDS FROM THIS BILL COULD SUPPORT MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE LARGE FACILITIES LIKE WATER SUPPLIERS AND WASTE WATER AGENCIES HOSPITALS AND CAMPUSES. AND THEN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED SMALL FACILITIES SUCH AS SCHOOLS AND FIRE STATIONS WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY AS A WITNESS IS JOHN KENNEDY FROM THE ROLE COUNTIES REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT THIS BILL IS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND HAS NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING AGAIN JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC WE ARE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF AB ELEVEN FORTY FOUR WE THINK THIS IS A COMPONENT -- GOING TOWARDS WHAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE RESILIENCE AND RECOVERABILITY AND THESE HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS -- WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE DE INTERNALIZATION EVENTS AND I IMAGINE THAT WE'LL SEE MORE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND AND CONTINUE IN FUTURE. THIS IS ONE WAY TO HELP ENSURE THAT OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE HAS THE BACKUP POWER NECESSARY TO AVOID -- SOME PRETTY NASTY CONSEQUENCES -- BACK IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN D. ENERGIES ATION EVENTS WE SAW A RISK OF UNTREATED WASTEWATER POTENTIALLY RUNNING OFF INTO STREAMS -- WE HAD -- WATER TREATMENT PLANTS THAT -- COULDN'T TREAT WATER AND COULDN'T PROVIDE WATER SO BY FOCUSING NARROWLY ON THESE -- CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES WE THINK IT IS A STEP FORWARD -- WE DO SEE A NEED FOR CONTINUED -- INVESTMENTS AND MICRO GRIDS AND OTHER TYPES OF STRATEGIES TO ENSURE THAT -- THESE COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE POWER AND THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT JUST THE LINGERING FOR DAYS AT A TIME WITHOUT POWER AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO PUMP WATER FROM THE GROUND FOR BATHING FOR SANITATION PURPOSES FOR ANYTHING -- SO WITHOUT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS YES I AM OKAY. FUNDED ARE DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS. ON THIS MEASURE -- SUPPORT RIPOSTE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MANUALLY ON BEHALF OF TESLA WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS ISSUE. AND APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE STILL ARE REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS BUT WE DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD -- ADDRESS ONE OF OUR KEY CONCERNS WHICH IS TO GIVE THE PC DIRECTION UPDATES RULES IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH. THE BILL'S OBJECTIVE -- HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OTHER AMENDMENT THAT -- THAT WOULD HOLD AN APPLICANT ACCOUNTABLE FOR A COMMUNITIES ACTION TO ADDRESS WILDFIRE RISK EVEN IF THE APPLICANT HASNO CONTROL OF POWER TO INFLUENCE A COMMUNITY'S. ACTIONS IN THIS REGARD AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR ON THIS CONCERN THANK YOU OKAY -- MEMBERS TO HAVE ANYTHING CENTER START. YEAH THANKS -- CAN CAN WE GET A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE WHAT WHAT THE THE FEED YOUR RECORDED IN FEET POWER BACK TO THE GREAT IF YOU'RE SURE TO CALL THE POINTS LIKE A DEMAND RESPONSE KIND OF FRAMEWORK -- HASN'T EXPLAINED YEAH YOU COULD. SURE SENATOR -- AYE AYE ACTUALLY THIS IS VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH YOUR SB SEVEN SEVEN FOUR ROUTE PLANNING. AND SO THE IDEA WOULD BE TO INSURE THAT BECAUSE IT IS LIMITED FUNDING AND IT'S ONLY FOR ONE YEAR. AND THERE ARE MANY OF FACILITIES THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE HERE THAT WE SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THOSE FACILITIES ARE PRETTY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY ITSELF SHOULD ALSO. IF WE WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE COORDINATING AND PLANNING ALONG WITH SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND SEVEN SEVEN FOUR AROUND THE WALL FOR MEDICATION PLANS. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION AND TO MISTER CANYON RC RC AND AND TO THE AUTHOR. I THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PUZZLE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SORT OUT WITH. AS SENATOR DOLLY IS WELL AND IS IT A BIGGER PUSH ON NOT LEAVE OUR COMMITTEES POWERLESS. IN THESE SO MY CONCERN IS. YOU SAID A HUNDRED SMALL AND TWENTY FIVE BIG. FROM MY CONVERSATION A CALLOW YES WE'RE IN THE THOUSANDS AT LEAST. GIVE A SENSE DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF SCALE HERE LIKE IN TERMS OF VULNERABILITY EVEN FOR THIS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE DO WE YET KNOW THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE FUNDING INTO THIS PROGRAM AND CERTAINLY GOING INTO THE FUTURE I MEAN THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT SOME OF THE ESTATE MONEY FROM BEING USED THIS IS AND THIS IS A GUARANTEED AT LEAST 10% OF IT WILL GO TOWARDS IS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S NOTHING. TO PREVENT MORE OF IT FROM GOING TOWARDS THAT BUT I THINK IF THE COMMENT IS THAT WE COULD USE MORE RESOURCES TO GO INTO THESE AREAS I COMPLETELY AGREE YEAH. AND I GUESS MY THE CHALLENGES I DON'T WANT TO TAKE I GUESS YOU HAS A UNIQUE FUNCTION WITHIN THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE RIGHT SO WE DON'T WANT. TO TAKE THAT ENTIRE POT WHICH WAS DESIGNED FOR ONESELF GENERATION TYPE AND THEN. TRY TO SOLVE THIS RESILIENCY PROBLEM WRIT LARGE WITH IT SO I THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO GET CREATIVE ABOUT IT WE HAVE TO PUSH THE COUNTY'S. EMERGENCY SERVICES TO STAR CORNING WITH PC SEPARATE SHE THE EFFORT I'D LOVE TO BE -- ADDED ON AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. WELL THAT'S YEAH I MEAN IF I GET ANYTHING SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR BACKUP POWER FOR THE STATE IS NOT SUFFICIENT. WE'RE GONNA BACK UP MAYBE THIRTY CAL FIRE FACILITIES WITH A FUNDING IN THE IN THIS THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THAT'S JUST CAL FIRE FACILITIES YOU'RE GONNA MAYBE COVER A HUNDRED WE GOT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS WE'VE GOT TO SOLVE THIS RIGHT NOW IS PART OF THE FIRE PACKAGE. WE SHOULD NOT BE WILLING TO FIRE PACKAGES LEGISLATURE WITHOUT RESILIENCY PLAN FOR NURSING ASSISTED FACILITIES AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE ON MEDICAL BASS LINE. GOT US ALL OF OUR THAT'S A GOVERNMENT SOAPBOX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

THIS IS COMMITTEE THE KNOWS FULL WELL HOW UNACCEPTABLE IS THAT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE STILL HAVE COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE REPRESENTING OVER MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO LACK ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER. WITH WATER DISTRICTS -- OFTENTIMES HAVING SO MUCH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IF THEY'RE ON THE VERGE OF CONTAMINATION. MANY OF THESE SYSTEMS CAN AFFORD TO MAKE NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS BUT ARE NEAR LARGER WATER DISTRICTS THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE CONSOLIDATION. CONSOLIDATION WATER SYSTEMS CAN ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS IN NEARBY AREAS RECEIVE CLEAN WATER BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE APPROVAL PROCESS CAN OFTEN BE VERY TIME CONSUMING. THE CPC HAS AN OBLIGATION REVIEW PROPOSED CONSOLIDATIONS BUT UNFORTUNATELY -- WE'VE SEEN VERY LONG TIME FRAMES AND WE KNOW THE LONGER REVIEW TAKES A LONGER CALIFORNIANS ARE LEFT WITH. UNSAFE DRINKING WATER WE NEED TO PROTECT BOTH EXISTING REPAIRS AND DELIVER CLEAN WATER TO NEW CUSTOMERS THIS BILL WOULD IMPOSE FLEXIBLE DEADLINES ON THE SI PC FROM ITS AUDITION APPROVAL. AND ENSURE THAT THE AGENCY HELP TO IMPLEMENT OUR STATES POLICIES TO PROVIDE WATER TO ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE SYS REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES.
