PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IN MANY OF

00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:34.613
OUR COUNTIES. THERE'S A FEELING

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:36.748
THAT THE STATE GIVES IT

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:38.784
DISCRETION TO DEPARTMENTS AND

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.152
THEY'RE ON AUTOMATIC PILOT

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:42.020
PILOT AND THEY MAKE DECISIONS

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:43.388
WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH THE

00:23:43.455 --> 00:23:44.990
LEGISLATURE AND SOME OF THOSE

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:46.057
DECISIONS HAVE A TREMENDOUS

00:23:46.124 --> 00:23:47.926
IMPACT EITHER ON RATE PAYERS

THE- BEYOND THE COST TO

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:54.566
BUSINESSES IN THE DISTRICT SO

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:56.434

REDUCTION STRATEGY. I THAT

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:30.728
BIOMASS IS IN SOME CASES OF

BEING LEFT ON THE SIDE OF THE

00:35:32.129 --> 00:35:33.598
ROAD OR IN FACT BEING PILED

00:35:33.664 --> 00:35:35.633
BURNED IN SOME CASES THAT IS

ROADMAP IT REALLY IS JUST A SET

00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:19.103

PARTICULAR THE FOCUS ON

00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:52.436
WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:54.171
MITIGATION IS MERIT AND THE

00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:55.973
MYRIAD. RISKS OF WELFARE

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.675
WEREN'T MULTIPLE STRATEGIES AS

00:37:57.742 --> 00:37:58.843
THE MINISTRATIONS NOTED

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:00.645
DEVELOPING THE PRIVATE MARKET

00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:02.279
FOR FOREST BIOMASS WOOD

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:03.948
PRODUCTS WOULD. COULD ACHIEVE

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:05.483
SEVERAL COMPLEMENTARY POLICY

00:38:05.549 --> 00:38:07.585
GOALS AND- THE CALL HAS MERIT

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:08.786
AND IT'S A CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:11.455
GOALS AND- OUTLINED IN THE- THE

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:12.490
GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE FORCE

00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:14.158
MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN ON TO

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.226
ENHANCE SUSTAINABLE TIMBER

00:38:15.292 --> 00:38:17.261
HARVEST SO. THE FUNDING REQUEST

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:18.763
BY OPR WOULD FUND FIVE PILOT

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:21.465
PROJECTS AND A WOOD PRODUCTS

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:23.768
EXPRESS. AND WHILE WE DON'T

00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:25.002
HAVE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH DETAIL

00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:26.303
ABOUT HOW EXACTLY THESE NEW

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:27.672
PROGRAMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED-

00:38:27.738 --> 00:38:28.806
AND AS THEY WOULD BE COMPLETELY

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:30.274
NEW PROGRAMS WE CAN'T REALLY

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:31.509
ASSESS THEIR AFFECT POTENTIAL

00:38:31.575 --> 00:38:32.576
EFFECTIVENESS TOWARDS

00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:33.711
DEVELOPING THE MARKET FOR

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:38.182
FORCED. BIOMASS WOOD PRODUCTS.

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:39.083
HOPE YOUR STATUS. FOR REQUEST

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.584
CAREER FOR IS TO BEGIN TO

00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.386
ESTABLISH THE WITH FEEDSTOCK

00:38:42.453 --> 00:38:43.854
PILOT PROJECTS IN THE CURRENT

00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:45.556
YEAR. AND IN OUR VIEW THIS IS

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:47.091
NOT A COMPELLING RATIONALE FOR

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:49.360
EARLY ACTION FUNDING WELL IT IS

00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:51.662
REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT OPR

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:53.064
COULD PREPARE GRANT AGREEMENT

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:53.998
FOR THESE PROJECTS SEVERAL

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:55.399
MONTHS EARLIER. PROVIDING A

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:56.634
CURRENT YEAR AUGMENTATION THAT

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:57.935
WOULD REDUCE THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.036
ABILITY TO CONSIDER THE

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:00.438
SPENDING IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:01.505
BROADER GENERAL FUND

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:03.007
PRIORITIES. SHOULD YOU PROVIDE

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:04.442
FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM WE

00:39:04.508 --> 00:39:05.209
WOULD RECOMMEND ALSO THAT YOU

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:06.711
ADD ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES SO

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:07.745
THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND LATER

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:08.946
EVALUATE HOW SUCCESSFUL THESE

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:12.116
NEW PROGRAMS WERE IN DEVELOPING

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:12.717
THE MARKET FOR FOREST BIOMASS

00:39:12.783 --> 00:39:14.552
WOOD PRODUCTS. I THINK I THINK

00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:15.853
YOU FOR THAT LAST COMMENT

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.722
BECAUSE I THINK THE-

00:39:17.788 --> 00:39:19.557
ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW WE-

00:39:19.623 --> 00:39:21.726
EVALUATE THE SUCCESS OF THE OF

00:39:21.792 --> 00:39:23.494
THE PILOT PROJECT IS GOING TO

00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:25.596
BE REALLY IMPORTANT SO IS IT.

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:27.932
TO CREATE JOBS IS IT TOO-

00:39:27.998 --> 00:39:29.967
ELIMINATE WOULD WASTE. TIME AND

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.235
MAYBE IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE BUT

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:32.703
HAVING ECONOMY MEASURES I THINK

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.438
WOULD BE VERY VERY APPROPRIATE.

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:36.440
CENTER NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:41.512
CHAIR. I'M VERY. EXCITED ABOUT

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:43.013
THIS PARTICULAR AREA. AND I

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.882
MIGHT NOTE THAT THEIR SENATOR

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:46.884
DOLLY AND ASSEMBLYWOMAN DAHLE

00:39:46.951 --> 00:39:49.220
A. R. AS WELL. A TECHNICIAN-

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:52.590
DOLLY AND I WORKED TOGETHER AND

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:54.558
I HAVE LITERALLY FOR DECADES.

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:56.727
IN THE MID EIGHTIES I WAS ABLE

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:58.395
TO HELP DON'T DEVELOP A CO

00:39:58.462 --> 00:40:00.865
GENERATION FACILITY THAT HAS

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:04.034
BURNED UP 290% OF THE RIFLES.

00:40:04.101 --> 00:40:05.603
IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAVE HELPED

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.972
SHAPE THE RICE INDUSTRY AND

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:10.374
ADDITION THAT PARTICULAR PLANT

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:11.742
WAS THE FIRST IN THE WORLD THAT

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:15.479
COULD BURN RICE STRAW. NOW THAT

00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:16.781
THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY MY POINT

00:40:16.847 --> 00:40:22.353
HERE BUT- THE DECADES BIOMASS

00:40:22.419 --> 00:40:24.421
IS GONNA JUST DIED ON THE VINE

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:26.290
IF YOU WILL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

00:40:26.357 --> 00:40:29.927
OVER RESISTANCE TO CITING

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:32.363
BIOMASS PLANTS. AND FOR MANY

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:36.634
REASONS BOTH OF THEM HAVE GONE.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.435
AND AS I JUST NOTED HERE THE

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:40.471
HOLES WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN

00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:41.806
AGRICULTURAL WASTE BUT THERE

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:43.040
ARE MANY OTHERS TO LIKE

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:46.610
CHRONIXX ORCHARDS AND VINEYARDS.

00:40:46.677 --> 00:40:47.978
AND WE'VE GOT A HUGE PROBLEM IN

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:50.881
CALIFORNIA WITH THE DISPOSAL OF

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:53.484
THOSE WASTE PRODUCTS. AND I'D

00:40:53.551 --> 00:40:55.119
LIKE TO PUT OUR STAFF IN TOUCH

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:57.922
WITH THE PARTICULAR AREA UP IN

00:40:57.988 --> 00:40:58.522
THE BUTTE COUNTY CALL CAPTAIN

00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:01.425

WHICH PROVIDES GENERAL FUND AND

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:43.359
SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:46.196

AND HOW THINGS ARE GOING AND

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:01.177
WHETHER THERE'S ANY NECESSARY.

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:03.346

FUNDING FROM PRIMARILY FEDERAL

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:54.631
TO GENERAL FUND- SHOULD WE NOT

NOW PROVIDE MORE OF A FOCUS ON

00:58:58.134 --> 00:59:00.103
ONE ONGOING OPERATIONAL FUNDING

00:59:00.169 --> 00:59:02.805
IN THE V- THE NATURE OF THAT

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:05.008
THAN THE EXTENT OF THAT AS PART

00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:10.013
OF THIS PROGRAM AND IF NOT.

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.648
WHAT WHAT WHAT REALLY IS THE

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:13.349
VALUE OF SIMPLY PROVIDING A

00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:15.518
ROOM ISN'T THERE MORE TO THIS

00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:17.520
PROGRAM AND TO THE TO THE

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:18.988
SOLUTION OVERALL THAN SIMPLY A

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:21.658
ROOM. BUT AREN'T SUPPORTIVE

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:23.326
SERVICES FOR EARLY CRITICAL ON

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:25.428
HOW DO WE EVALUATE. THAT IN THE

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:26.763
PROCESS WE WOULD CALL THAT A

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.965
COMPOUND QUESTION IN LAW SCHOOL

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:30.099
I CAN BREAK IT DOWN BUT THE

00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:32.135
POINT IS. ARE WE CONSIDERING

00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:35.171
ONGOING FUNDING. SHOULD WE BE

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:35.705
PROVIDING THAT OUT OF THE

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:37.307
GENERAL FUND. AND IF NOT WHY

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:40.443
NOT. I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT-

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.512
SENATORS- PREJUDICE

00:59:42.578 --> 00:59:43.012
UNDERSTANDING THERE WAS

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:45.281
OPERATION SUPPORT ARE PROVIDED

TO EACH AND EVERY PROJECT IN

00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:48.418
THE INITIAL ON KEY ROUTE IN

00:59:48.484 --> 00:59:49.819
FACT THE STATE PROVIDED AT

00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:50.520

SUPPORT UP FRONT OFFER EACH AND

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:54.757
EVERY PROJECT- SO THAT WOULD

00:59:54.824 --> 00:59:55.758
CONTINUE UNDER THIS THE

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:57.160
FLEXIBILITY GENERAL FUND WILL

00:59:57.226 --> 00:59:59.128
CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR THAT. AND

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:01.197
I WAS BECAUSE FIFTY MILLION WAS

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:02.865
INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.667
TO AUGMENT THE SIERRA FUNDS TO

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:05.969
ALLOW FOR US TO PROVIDE THAT

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:08.538
pABLE TO BE CONTINUED.

01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:10.173
ADDITIONALLY WE REQUIRED

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:11.874
PROJECTS TO IDENTIFY FIVE YEARS

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.109
OF OPERATING SUPPORT SO THEY

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:14.077
WERE ABLE TO DO THAT THE LOCAL

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:15.445
SOURCES OF THE RECEIVING

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:18.214
AUTHORIZED THERE'S QUITE A FEW-

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.315
RESOURCE RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:21.117
DO SO- OBVIOUS A LOT OF FEDERAL

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:23.019
FUNDS FLOWING AS WELL SO THAT

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:24.420
IS ACTUALLY QUITE UNIQUE. WE'RE

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:25.922
TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPING

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:27.090
PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:28.992
HOUSING FOLKS ARE HOMELESS-

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:29.926
MAYBE IT'S A DIRTY SECRET BUT

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.327
I'M HAPPY SHARED HERE IT'S

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:32.628
OFTEN QUITE CHALLENGING TO FIND

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:34.530
ONGOING OPERATING SUPPORT FIVE

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:35.898
YEARS IS ACTUALLY MORE THAN THE

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.700
NORM. SO OUR REQUIREMENT FOR

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:38.234
THAT ACTUALLY NEED THESE

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.402
PROJECTS QUITE SUSTAINABLE

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.337
WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT- THERE'S A

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:42.438
LOT OF RESOURCES OUT THERE

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:43.673
INCLUDING SOME ADMINISTERED BY

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.476
A CD AND ONGOING FASHION HELPS.

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:47.810
DEAL WITH ALMOST IS OF COURSE A

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:48.878
MATTER OF POLITICAL WILL SO

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:50.513
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL HAVE TO

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.149
CONTINUE TO. PRIMARILY FOCUS

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.717
THEIR EFFORTS IN THAT WAY

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:55.618
CERTAINLY BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO

01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:56.886
WORK WITH ALL PROJECTS AND

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:57.720
THAT'S WHAT WE DID THE FIRST

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:58.721
TIME AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:00.223
THERE WAS ADEQUATE SUPPORT

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:02.558
MOVING FORWARD. WHAT IS IT WHEN

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.494
IT WHAT WE DO TYPICALLY IS IT'S

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.561
ESSENTIALLY CAPITALIZED

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:07.030
OPERATING SUPPORT UP FRONT SO

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:09.365
YOU MAY NOT BE USING IT ALL BUT

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:11.401
YOU'RE DRAWING DOWN FROM THAT

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:12.001
OVER TIME SO WE HAVE A NUMBER

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.503
OF OUR- PRETTY LANDMARK

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:14.771
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:15.605
EXAMPLE DO YOU THAT IT

01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:16.706
PROVIDES. A CAPITALIZE

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.441
OPERATING SUPPORT UP FRONT THAT

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:19.942
CAN BE DRAWN DOWN OVER TIME AND

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:21.577
THAT'S A SIMILAR MODEL THAT IS

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.312
KIND OF BEEN UTILIZED HERE-

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:24.881
WITH BOTH LOCAL SOURCES AND

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:25.481
WHAT THE SORT RESOURCES

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:27.216
PROVIDE. SO I WOULD COMPLETELY

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:28.751
AGREE WITH YOU IT IS NOT JUST

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:30.953
ABOUT THE REAL AND THESE

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.321
PROJECTS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:33.990
THOSE THE ROOM THE ACQUISITION

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:35.258
IS QUITE UNIQUE BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.559
UTILIZING EXISTING FACILITIES

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:43.132
AND MOST. OF THE TIME HOTELS

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:43.733
AND MOTELS AND I AS WELL THIS

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.601
IS FOR LESS EXPENSIVE THAN YOU.

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:46.469
BUT CERTAINLY A HUGE. FOR

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:47.203
INTERIM PERMANENT. IN THAT

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.837
OPERATING ZERO SUPPORT WE WERE

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:49.305
A TO BUY THE FIRST AROUND IT

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:52.675
WAS. ANTICIPATED SO. YOU INTEND

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:54.077
TO CONTINUE THE FIVE YEAR.

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.912
REQUIREMENT ON A GO FORWARD

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:58.781
BASIS. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.450
IDEA FOR A SUSTAINABILITY IN

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.418
TERMS OF- MAKING SURE THESE

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:03.152
PROJECTS HAVE THE POLITICAL

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:05.221
SUPPORT LOOK LEVEL BUT WE MAY

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:06.155
EVEN BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.356
ADDITIONAL OFFERING SUPPORT

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.825
THEY WERE THE FIRST AROUND WE

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:09.859
WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE UP TO TWO

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:12.061
YEARS OF THAT FIVE YEARS FOR

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:13.863
EVERY PROJECT- THE FIRST TIME

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:14.831
AROUND SO WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.033
MORE OF THAT. GIVEN THE GREATER

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.034
FLEXIBILITY OF GENERAL FUND

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:20.169
DOLLARS- BUT WE DO BELIEVE IT

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:22.238
IS IMPORTANT FROM THE OUTSET TO

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:23.272
DETERMINE HOW YOU GONNA FONG I

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:25.374
THINK ANOTHER COMPONENT IS MANY

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:27.210
OF THESE PROJECTS ARE BEGIN TO

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.778
OPERATE AS INTERIM HOUSING AND

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:30.680
THEN PLAN TO CONVERT TO FULLY

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:32.215
TO PERMANENT HOUSING IN WHICH

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:34.083
CASE AT THOSE THAT THOSE STAGES

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.284
THERE OTHER RESOURCE AVAILABLE

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:37.320
TO THEM OFF FOR THE CONVERSION

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:39.355
AS WELL AS OTHER INCOME STREAMS

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.324
WILL NOT ROBUST. ARE THEY WILL

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.625
BE COLLECTING RENTS OF COURSE

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:44.260
ON THOSE PROPERTIES EVEN THOUGH

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:46.095
THEY ARE PERMITS FOR HOUSING-

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:47.196
THEY WILL STOP SHORTFALL THEY

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.331
NEED TO MAKE UP BUT THERE WILL

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:50.366
BE LESS ONCE THEY ARE GETTING

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.135
REVENUE. I'M SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:56.239
WITH THIS. IN IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:57.740
VETERANS. SUPPORT OF HOUSING.

01:02:57.807 --> 01:02:58.808
IT WAS BOND MONEY WHICH CAN USE

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.543
BOND MONEY TO FOR OPERATING

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.378
SUPPORT. AND THE- THE

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.880
DIFFICULTY AT LEAST THAT

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:05.047
SOMEWHERE FINDING TRYING TO

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:07.083
SECURE THE- SUPPORT OF SERVICES

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.684
COMPONENT OF. PERMANENT

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.253
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR TEMPORARY

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:12.989
SUPPORT OF HOUSING. HAVE SO AS

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.824
PART OF THIS EXPENDITURE

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:17.426
AUTHORIZATION. HAVE YOU

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:18.694
ANALYZED THE FINANCIAL

01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:21.731
CAPABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:03:21.797 --> 01:03:23.733
TO PROVIDE ONGOING PERMANENT

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:25.568
AND ONGOING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.670
FOR THESE PROJECTS ONCE

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:28.304
WHATEVER TIMELINE USE THAT RUNS

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:31.140
OUT. WELL THAT WAS WHY WE HAD

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:33.042
THE FIVE YEAR RISING THAT THEY

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:34.810
HAD TO COMMIT TO SO THAT'S

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:35.778
EXACTLY WHAT WAS PART OF THAT

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:37.180
EVALUATION RIGHT IN WORKING

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:38.848
WITH THEM TO DETERMINE THAT

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:41.050
THOSE WERE REAL AND ACTIONABLE

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:42.552
AND SO WE OF COURSE WANTED TO

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:43.886
SEE IF WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:45.588
LOCALLY ALL THE PROJECTS WITH

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.023
CELEBRITY SUPPORTS IT WAS NOT

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:48.057
COMPLETELY ON THE LOCAL

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:49.392
GOVERNMENTS. AND IN FACT

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.861
PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERS CAME IN

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:52.562
WITH SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:55.431
FOR QUITE HELPFUL- BUT YES THAT

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:56.365
IS PART OF THE EVALUATIVE

01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:58.668
COMPONENT IS MAKING SURE THAT

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:00.102
THESE PRODUCTS ARE REAL

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.437
CERTAINTY THAT THE PROVISION OF

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:02.772
SERVICES THE SERVICES PLANS

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:04.640
THOSE ARE ALL PART OF THE ACT

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:07.310
OF THAT APPLICATION- IT IS NOT

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:08.911
IT WAS NOT JUST EXPEDIENCY WELL

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:10.079
THAT WAS QUITE IMPORTANT IN THE

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:10.980
FIRST ROUND. BUT WE'RE

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:12.315
EVALUATING ALL THOSE SORTS OF

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:13.849
THINGS AS WELL AND THOSE ARE

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:16.352
CRITERIA- THAT WE HAD THE FIRST

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:17.186
TIME AROUND AND WILL CONTINUE

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.621
WORKING FOR WOMEN IN LIGHT OF

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:19.755
THE FACT THAT WE'RE CONTINUING

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:21.857
AND EXPANDING THE PROGRAM. AND

01:04:21.924 --> 01:04:24.393
GIVEN THE FINANCIAL SITUATION

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.162
THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP AND

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:29.532
DOWN. THE STATE SEEM TO BE

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:31.634
FINDING. I GUESS OF THEM. IN AT

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.536
THIS POINT DUE TO THE CODE

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:34.203
NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN THE

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:38.374
UNCERTAINTY. OF BACKUP FUNDING

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:38.975
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.577
OTHERWISE. WHAT'S YOUR

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.079
PROJECTION FOR THE SUCCESS OF

01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:44.280
CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THIS

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:48.718
PROGRAM THEN. WELL IT'S A THAT

01:04:48.784 --> 01:04:49.652
THERE'S STILL A SIGNIFICANT

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:50.453
INTEREST IN THE LOCAL

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:51.954
GOVERNMENT LEVEL RIGHT AND THEY

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:53.122
KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO DO THESE

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:54.390
PROJECTS WE ARE GETTING A LOT

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:56.158
OF ENQUIRIES ABOUT IF WE CAN DO

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:57.393
MORE OF THIS FROM OUR LOCAL

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.528
GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. SO TO SOME

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:00.630
DEGREE THAT IS I THINK AN

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:02.732
IMPORTANT DATA POINT FOR

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:04.100
WHETHER THERE'S COMMITMENT I

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.701
WOULD ALSO ADD THAT THERE ARE A

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:07.403
NUMBER OF SOURCES COMING WELL

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:08.738
OF COURSE THERE COULD BE MORE

01:05:08.804 --> 01:05:09.772
OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:11.474
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF RESOURCES

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:11.907
CAN LOOK GOVERNMENTS

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:13.409
PARTICULARLY FOR HOMELESSNESS.

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:15.044
THAT THEY COULDN'T THEY HAD DID

USE IN THE FIRST ROUND TO

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:16.879
PARTNER WITH THE SIGNATURE

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:17.980
COULD YOU STILL USE MOVING

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:20.816

LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. LOW

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:19.555

THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:03.786
RAISED- TODAY ARE THE ISSUES

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:06.955
THAT I HAD CONCERNED ABOUT- I

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:11.026
THINK YOU. FOR PROVIDING ME A

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:13.462
LIST OF THE OF THE- OF THE

PROJECTS THAT WERE APPROVED-

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:16.932
AND THE REASON I ASK FOR THE

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.367
PROJECT LIST AS I WANTED TO GET

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:19.968
A GOOD SENSE OF WHETHER THE

01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:21.603
RESOURCES THAT WE SPENT THE

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:23.806
CASH MONEY. EIGHT HUNDRED

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.541
MILLION DOLLARS WAS SPENT-

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:28.210
WHERE WE SPENT AND WHETHER IT-

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.312
IF THEY WERE AREAS WHERE A

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:32.281
MAJORITY THE MONEY WENT THOSE

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:33.982
KINDS OF THINGS AND SELL OUT MY

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:35.350
APPROVAL OF IT IS I HAD ONE

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:36.852
PROJECT IN MY DISTRICT OF A

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:38.854
MILLION PEOPLE THAT WAS-

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:40.656
SUPPORTED IN IT WITHIN THE CITY

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:41.824
OF SALINAS WHICH IS THE BIGGEST

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:44.626
CITY. IN MY DISTRICT OF A

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:45.661
HUNDRED AND SIXTY HUNDRED

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:46.962
SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE- BUT I

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:48.530
HAVE TWENTY SEVEN CITIES THAT

01:12:48.597 --> 01:12:50.032
ARE REPRESENTED EVERY SINGLE

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.400
ONE OF THOSE CITIES HAVE

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:52.134
ADVISED ME THAT THEY HAVE A

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.636
HOMELESS. POPULATION THAT THEY

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.972
ARE UNABLE TO SERVE SO TWENTY

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.741
SIX OF THE CITY'S DID NOT-

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:00.175
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:02.511
AND I THINK THE REASON IS THAT

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:03.679
THE RURAL AGRICULTURAL

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:04.980
COMMUNITIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.081
THE WHERE WITH ALL TO

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:08.183
IMMEDIATELY RESPOND. TO AN

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.853
OPPORTUNITY THAT WOULD BENEFIT

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:13.222
BENEFITTED THE RESIDENTS SO

01:13:13.288 --> 01:13:14.923
NUMBER ONE IS I'M CONCERNED

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:19.428
THAT WE DON'T- WE DON'T. USE

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:21.630
SPEED AS THE WAY TO GET MONEY

01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:23.332
OUT BECAUSE THEN WE

01:13:23.398 --> 01:13:26.201
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT- THE

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:29.138
COMMUNITIES AND MAJORITY OF-

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:31.306
LET ME JUST SAY THAT MY- QUICK

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:33.208
PERUSAL. WITHOUT ADDING UP THE

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:35.677
NUMBERS IS THAT A MAJORITY OF

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:36.211
THE FUNDS WENT TO SOUTHERN

01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:38.680
CALIFORNIA- LOS ANGELES ORANGE

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:41.817
COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO. AND THAT.

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:43.952
AS I LOOKED THROUGH THE LAST

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:47.089
THERE WERE VERY FEW- RURAL

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:50.759
COMMUNITIES AND SO- IT IF WE'RE

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:52.494
ROLLING OUT A PROJECT TO BE

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:53.796
EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:54.897
THINK IT MAKE WE NEED TO BE

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:56.165
ABLE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:57.933
THAT THERE MAY BE. OTHER NEED

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.168
TO MAYBE IT'S A TECHNICAL

01:13:59.234 --> 01:14:01.203
ASSISTANCE WE WERE JUST TALKING

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.338
ABOUT OVER IT- PR. BUT THE

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:05.040
OTHER THING IS THE LOCAL

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:08.143
GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT- AND THAT

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.978
WAS RAISED I THINK BY BY BOTH

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.680
OF THE SENATORS HERE ON. ON THE

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:14.716
DINER ALL OF US. AND AND WHAT

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:16.819
HAPPENS IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:20.422
CAN CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE THE

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:21.957
SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED IN

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:23.125
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:24.960
THESE THESE MOTEL ROOMS THAT

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:30.399
ARE NOW- HOME KEY ROOM AND AN

01:14:30.465 --> 01:14:32.301
ICE THAT BECAUSE HAVING SERVED

01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:32.868
FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND LOCAL

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:34.970
GOVERNMENT. WHENEVER THERE IS A

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:37.339
DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY CITIES

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:39.074
FELT IT WORSE THAN THE STATE IN

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:41.343
THE COUNTY DID- AND AS A

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:42.578
CONSEQUENCE THERE WERE TIMES

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:44.813
WHEN WE CLOSED. ESSENTIAL

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.782
SERVICES LIKE RECREATIONAL

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:49.651
PROGRAMS AND LIBRARY SERVICES

01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:52.287
IN ORDER TO. FOCUS ON THE MAIN

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:55.290
SERVICES WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:55.891
HAD TO PROVIDE WHICH IS FIRE

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:58.760
AND POLICE AND- THIS WOULD BE

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:01.430
ONE OF THOSE SERVICES. THAT IT

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:03.265
AND QUITE FRANKLY BUT WE GOT

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:06.001
RID OF WAS- EMERGENCY SERVICE

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:08.170

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:17.646
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:19.081
THAT IT'S LIKELY TO GO BY THE

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:20.349
WAYSIDE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:21.617
DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES SO.

01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:23.085
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IF WE

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:26.355

STATE FUNDS. AND AT THE POINT

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:41.436
THAT THE STATE IS IN A CRISIS

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:42.537
AND WE DON'T HAVE THOSE FRIENDS

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:44.473
ANYMORE THEN IT'LL FALL AND

IT OVER THE YEARS THE

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:55.710

WITH STATE LAW AND THAT THE

01:32:32.713 --> 01:32:34.215
BETTER SOLUTION RATHER THAN

01:32:34.282 --> 01:32:36.717
FIXING IT DEFICIENT SYSTEM IS

01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:38.286
TO JOIN THAT NEIGHBOR SYSTEM.

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:40.121

01:32:40.187 --> 01:32:41.155
THE RESPONSIBILITY I'M

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:43.891

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:49.530
THE CONTRACTOR THAT WAS HIRED

01:32:49.597 --> 01:32:51.699
TO DO THE ASSESSMENT- WITHOUT

AT WHAT EXISTED IN DIDN'T

01:32:58.439 --> 01:32:59.840

OF THESE ARE VERY REMOTELY

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:22.797
pTHAT'S A POSSIBILITY WITH

01:33:22.863 --> 01:33:24.532
DEPENDS ON HOW CLOSE THEY ARE

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:26.000
TO CONNECTING TO A SYSTEM AND

01:33:26.067 --> 01:33:27.735

SEEMS TO ME THAT THEM TO THE

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:40.548
EXTENT. IT IT IS. IT'S RARE

01:33:40.614 --> 01:33:41.882

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:58.399
MODEST AND I'M VERY OLD AND-

01:33:58.466 --> 01:33:59.500
COULD REALLY USE SOME

01:33:59.567 --> 01:34:01.035
REHABILITATION INCLUDING

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:03.704
WEATHERIZATION AND SOLAR PANELS

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:05.239
THE KIND OF THINGS THAT MAKE

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:08.342
THEM MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND-

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:12.013
RATHER THAN. JUST DO SOME

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:13.814
COSMETIC WORK I THINK WE GOT A

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:19.020
LOOK AT WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO-

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:21.555
TO FIX SOME OF THE- STRUCTURAL

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:22.857
ISSUES LIKE THE WASTE WATER

01:34:22.923 --> 01:34:24.959
TREATMENT AND SEWER. AND IF

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:27.194
IT'S POSSIBLE AND WHAT ARE THE

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:28.763
KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT

01:34:28.829 --> 01:34:33.200

THAT IS THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:42.043
