WOULD SENATE BUDGET BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE NUMBER FIVE. TO REVIEW THE CALS CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY'S REVISED DRAFT TWENTY TWENTY. BUSINESS PLAN. CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL IS THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT IN THE COUNTRY AND WOULD BE THE NATION'S. FIRST TRUE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. THE PROJECT CONTINUES TO FACE SERIOUS CHALLENGES THOUGH. LACK OF FUNDING. COST OVERRUNS SCHEDULE CHANGES AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT ISSUES. IN THE COMING YEAR THE LEGISLATURE MAY BE ASKED TO TAKE A BUDGET ACTION. TO MOVE THE CURRENT PROJECT FORWARD. NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE AT. WHAT IS IT AUTHORITY DELIVERING. FOR THE OVERALL BENEFITS TO THE STATE. OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECOME A TRUE. FUNDING PARTNER. TODAY WE WILL HEAR ABOUT CURRENT CONSTRUCTION AND FUTURE PLANS. WE WILL ALSO HEAR CONCERNS FROM OUR TRUSTED OVERSIGHT PARTNERS. MEMBERS WE HAVE VERY IMPORTANT DECISIONS TO MAKE TODAY AND WE ASK THAT EACH OF YOU. ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND HARD QUESTIONS AND ENSURE WE GET THOSE ANSWERS WE NEED. I'LL NOW TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR THAT ALSO FOR ANY OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD MORNING COLLEAGUES- MANAGER APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND- YOU'RE PULLING THIS HEARING TOGETHER. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IS OBVIOUSLY AN ENORMOUS UNDERTAKING. A MASSIVE PROJECT THAT HAS CREATED. THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS AND IS TRANSFORMING THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE CENTER ABOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ISN'T AN AMBITIOUS BET ON THE FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RESHAPE THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. THE CHALLENGE THE AUTHORITY FACES AND DELIVERING ON ITS PROMISE IS DAUNTING. AND THE AMBITION TO DO SO IS COMMENDABLE. GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROJECT ITS COST AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT THE PROJECT AND MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE BUILDING. WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST AND WHEN WE ARE GOING TO SEE THE BENEFIT WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A STATE PROJECT. BUT NOT ALL PARTS OF THE STATE WILL BENEFIT FROM THE PROJECT AT THE SAME TIME OR IN THE SAME WAY. MY DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM THE PROJECT. UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF PHASE ONE SOMETIME IN THE TWENTY THIRTIES. EVEN AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO SPEND BILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. ADDITIONALLY THE STATUS SPENDING A QUARTER OF ITS CAP AND TRADE REVENUE ON THE PROJECT. EVEN THOUGH WE WON'T SEE REAL CLIMATE BENEFITS FROM THE PROJECT FOR A DECADE OR LONGER. AT THIS POINT I EXPECT A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA READ IS RESIDENTS WILL GET OUT OF THE PROJECT. AND WHEN THEY WILL SEE THE BENEFIT. OF THE SAME WAY THAT I EXPECT ALL RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA EXPECT. I LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S GOOD DISCUSSION AND EXPLORING THESE ISSUES IN GREATER DETAIL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR THE RUSSELL AND I DON'T SEE OUR VICE CHAIRS HERE SO WE WILL MOVE ON- AGAIN TO ENSURE THAT OUR WITNESSES HAVE THE- TOLL FREE NUMBER FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE CALLING NOW PLEASE- YOU CAN DIAL. TOLL FREE EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE SIX THREE SIX FOUR. WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE ACCESS CODE. EIGHT SEVEN SIX EIGHT NINE FOUR ONE. NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR FIRST PRESENTER BRIAN KELLY CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE BUSINESS PLAN THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER KELLY FOR JOINING US. YOU'RE ON. THANK YOU ADJOURNMENTS CALLS AND A JERK IT ALSO IT IS MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY I'M- ALWAYS HONORED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE SENATE. HOUSE IN WHICH I WORKED FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS OF MY CAREER. I SHOULD BE BEFORE YOU TODAY. I HAVE A BRIEF POWER POINT- THAT I WILL MOVE THROUGH. QUICKLY IN THE INTEREST OF TIME BUT THIS IS. INTENDED TO SUMMARIZE WHAT IS IN THE DRAFT. REVISED DRAFT TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN THAT WE RELEASED ON FEBRUARY NINTH SO WITHOUT. FURTHER ADO WE'LL GET RIGHT INTO THE PRESENTATION. FIRST LIGHT PLEASE. I JUST BY WAY OF TIME LINE WE INTRODUCED AS REVISED DRAFT PLAN ON FEBRUARY NINTH AT OUR BOARD HEARING WE ARE IN A THIRTY DAY PUBLIC REVIEW PERIOD- THAT ENDS ENDED ON MARCH TWELFTH HOWEVER OF COURSE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE- OVERSIGHT HEARINGS WITH THE- LEGISLATURE. MY BOARD WILL RECONVENE ON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH TWO REVIEW COMMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE DRAFT PLAN SINCE THEY'VE BEEN OUT. AND THE BOARD WILL CONSIDER. ANY CHANGES TO THAT DRAFT PLAN WHERE REQUIRED UNDER THE AGREEMENT NOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP TO SUBMIT THE FINAL. DRAFT PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE ON APRIL FIFTEENTH. JUST A COMMENT ABOUT THIS NOT WITHSTANDING. THE ADOPTION OF THE PLAN THERE WILL OBVIOUSLY BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION. WITH THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THIS BUDGET PROCESS IS WE- SEEK. THE REMAINING- PROP ONE A. BOND FUNDS WE CAN COMPLETE THE CONSTRUCTION WORK IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO. AGAIN NOT WITHSTANDING THE ADOPTION THE BUSINESS PLAN WE KNOW THERE'S A LONGER CONVERSATION OF ONE LIKELY GO THROUGH THE ENTIRETY. OF THE CURRENT BUDGET PROCESS NEXT LIKE. THE BUSINESS PLAN DOES TALK ABOUT SEVERAL ELEMENTS OF OUR PROGRAM INCLUDING HOW WE WERE IMPACTED BY THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WHAT WE ARE NOT AN OPERATING TRANSIT ENTITY YET CERTAINLY OUR ENTERPRISE WAS IMPACTED SEVERELY. BY VARIOUS PARTS OF COPING NINETEEN. WE RECORDED SOME TWO HUNDRED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY- WORKERS IN TWENTY TWENTY- WE HAD A AT LEAST A CASH FLOW HIT ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO. CAP AND TRADE REVENUE THAT MARKET WAS IMPACTED SEVERELY RIGHT WHEN THE- COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC BEGAN LAST MARCH AND THE FIRST ARJUN WAS EXTREMELY. LOW THOSE AUCTIONS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER AND BETTER WITH THE SUBSEQUENT AUCTIONS BUT FOR TWENTY TWENTY WE WERE DOWN ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION VERSUS PRIOR YEAR AUCTIONS ONE COMMENT ON THIS THE WAY TO A- CAP AND TRADE AUCTIONS WORK. THE ALLOWANCES THAT WERE NOT SOLD IN TWENTY TWENTY WE EXPECT TO BE SOLD SO WE DO THINK. WE WILL RECOVER MUCH OF THIS THIS MONEY OVER TIME HOWEVER DOES REFLECT THE CASH FLOW IMPACT. THAT THAT WE REPORT IN THE BUSINESS. WE ALSO DID PUSH BACK OUR ALSO. FOR SEVERAL OUR PROJECTS SECTIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM COMMUNITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS. ARE MORE TIME TO REVIEW THOSE. AND WE PUSH BACK OUR TRACKING SYSTEMS PROCUREMENT CONTRACT. BUT NOW READY- THAT NOW SAID TO BE. HEARD BY OUR BOARD IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY A TWENTY ONE. AND OF CURSE SOME OF OUR RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITIONS WERE AFFECTED BY. LIMITED COURTHOUSE HOURS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO ENTERPRISE WIDE A QUITE AN IMPACT FROM COCA NINETEEN THAT- CERTAINLY IMPACTED OUR OUR SCHEDULE NEXT SLIDE. WE OPTED IN THE BUSINESS PLAN ON WHERE WE ARE ON CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE. WE HAVE THREE CONSTRUCTION PACKAGES UNDER WAY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. CONSTRUCTION PACKAGES ONE. TWO THREE AND FOUR A COMBINED TO BE A HUNDRED NINETY MILES OF THE- CIVIL WORKS THE- BRIDGES AND SORT OF STRAX SUB WORK THAT'S NECESSARY- TO- ALTERNATELY GET THE SYSTEM UP AND OPERATING IN CENTRAL VALLEY WE ARE IN CONSTRUCTION OF A HUNDRED OF A- HUNDRED NINETY MILES OF THAT. SEGMENT DEBT NOW THROUGH THESE THREE PACKAGES THIS CHART OF THE BOX ON THE RIGHT SHOWS ARE OUR CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE WE ANTICIPATE COMPLETING. C. P. ONE AND TWO AND THREE BY THIS- OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE FOR- JUST THIRTEEN MONTHS FROM NOW WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE WITH THAT- THAT'S THE TWENTY ONE MILES IS THE FURTHEST. SOUTH OF THE HUNDRED NINETY MILE SET OUR TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT AWARD AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE'RE HOPING TO AWARD LATER THIS FALL AND ALLOW WORK TO COMMENCE AS EARLY AS TWENTY TWENTY TWO ALL I KNOW THE TRACKING SYSTEMS INSTALLATION ELEMENT. OF THE BOX ON THE RIGHT THERE IS OUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLETION STATUS WE HAVE CLEARED A HUNDRED NINETY NINE MILES OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILE SEGMENT. TO DATE INCLUDING A TWO SEGMENTS THAT WERE CLEARED DURING THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE TWO MORE SEGMENTS ON THIS MAP THE ORANGE LINE. AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT CENTRAL VALLEY STRETCH INTO PALMDALE THIS IS OUR INITIALS ENTREE IF YOU WILL INTO SOUTHERN. CALIFORNIA WE EXPECT TO CLEAR THOSE THIS SUMMER FROM THE PALMDALE EXTENSION AND A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE YEAR FROM BURBANK TO LOS ANGELES EXTENSION THOSE COMBINED TO BE A ROUGHLY A HUNDRED MORE MILES. BUT NINETY ONE MORE MONTHS. OF THE BEST IT WILL CLEAR THE WAY. SO THAT ALL FORTY NINETY FOUR WILL BE. UP BY THE END OF TWENTY TWO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. NEXT SLIDE. WE IDENTIFIED IN OUR DRAFT PLAN A CONSTRUCTION COSTS. AGAIN THIS IS ALL WITHIN THE- ALLOCATION OF FUNDS OF THE PROJECT. CURRENTLY HAS BUT WE WILL. WANT TO ADJUST WE CALL OUR BASELINE BUDGET- TO ME CONSTRUCTION COSTS THAT ARE. WE'VE IDENTIFIED KNOWN COSTS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND WE ALSO ARE PROPOSING. TO INCREASE OUR WHAT WE CALL OUR RISK CONTINGENCY. PUT MORE MONEY INTO RISK CONTINGENCY TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS SO WE WOULD MOVE OUR CENTRAL VALLEY BUDGET FROM TWELVE POINT FOUR THIRTEEN. POINT EIGHT AGAIN A BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT IS WHAT WE CALL RISK CONTINGENCY AND THE DONATION HERE IS THE. SEE THAT WE MUST GET DONE TO FINISH THE WORK IN THE RISK ELEMENT IS RECOGNIZING THAT THOSE ARE STILL SUBJECT TO COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATION THE FUTURE THERE'S SOME. RISK IN THOSE NUMBERS SO WE WANT TO HAVE A CONTINGENCY. TO DEAL WITH THAT AS WELL AS SOMETHING WE LEARNED FROM COPING NINETEEN WHICH IS THAT. THE RISK IS ALL AROUND US YEAH IT DOES SOMETIMES YOU CAN ANTICIPATE THE IMPACTS PROGRESS THERE ARE KNOWN AND SERVE AS A SORT OF PRUDENT PRACTICE WE WANT TO EXPAND. THAT RISK CONTINGENCY POT. NEXT SLIDE. THIS AGAIN IS OUR- OUR SCHEDULE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT COMPLETION. YOU SEE IN THE MIDDLE COLUMN THERE THAT. IN TWENTY TWENTY- WE PUT OUT FOR DRAFTING FORMAL DOCUMENTS. TO IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GETTING INTO THE BAY AREA. WE WILL COMPLETE THAT WORK OR BRING THOSE TO OUR BOARD. FOR WHAT WE CALL RECORD OF DECISION OR ROD CERTIFICATION. AT THE- AB SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN THE FIRST PART OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AT THE FINAL TO. PASS WILL BE RELEASED LATER THIS YEAR AND- WE HOPE TO FINISH THAT WORK AND CERTIFY THOSE RIGHTS THE END OF TWENTY TWO BEGINNING OF A TWENTY TWENTY THREE. NEXT SLIDE. IN FEBRUARY WHEN WE PUT OUT OUR DRAFT PLAN AND EVEN OUR LAST PROJECT UPDATE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. FROM TWENTY NINETEEN WE INDICATED AN INTEREST. TO MOVE THE HUNDRED NINETY MILES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE IN CONSTRUCTION THE BALLOT. TO EXTEND THOSE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILE IN A ROOM SERVICE AND THAT IS SO WE CAN GET ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED SERVICE GOING. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY CONNECTING THE CITIES OF MERCED. FRESNO AND BAKERSFIELD. WE DID AN EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THIS WITH A- OPERATING ENTITY THAT OPERATES HIGH SPEED RAIL IN GERMANY TODAY. AND WE CAME UP WITH THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS EARLY OPERATING SYSTEM THAT WOULD. REDUCE TRAVEL TIME COMPARED TO THE CURRENT. SERVICES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BETWEEN NINETY AND A HUNDRED MINUTES. A WE WOULD INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF SERVICE FROM SEVEN DAILY TRIPS TODAY. THE UP TO EIGHTEEN DAILY TRIPS. WE WOULD CONNECT THREE THE FASTEST GROWING CITIES IN THE STATE. DO THE GREATEST RIDERSHIP INCREASE AND FAREBOX BENEFIT. FROM THE SMALLEST INVESTMENT. COMPARED TO INVESTING THOSE SAME DOLLARS IN OTHER CORRIDORS. AND IT PROVIDES FOR INTERIM CONNECTION TO PARTSNORTH OF THE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE WHICH MEANS WE WOULD CONNECT WITH THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM IN MERCED- THAT SYSTEM WOULD CONTINUE ON UP TO SACRAMENTO AND OAKLAND. AND THE AC SYSTEM WHICH IS NOW BEING EXTENDED TO MERCED WOULD ALSO ULTIMATELY GO THAT NOW GOES TO THE BERRY WOULD ALSO HAVE TRIPS TO SACRAMENTO IN THE FUTURE YEAH DUBBED THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE NAY AT PERCENT. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILE SEGMENT IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE SOME CHILDREN THREE THOUSAND JOB YEARS. NEARLY FORTY BILLION IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. NEXT SLIDE. THE OTHER IMPORTANT PART OF THIS EXTENSION IS WHAT WE CALL GETTING OUT OF THE ORCHARDS AND INTO THE CITIES. AND THAT IS AT POPLAR AVENUE PICTURE THERE ON THE TOP LEFT. IS A PHOTO OF THE CURRENT TERMINATION POINT. FOR THE HUNDRED NINETEEN FIRST CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT HUNDRED NINETY MILE. CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT. PART OF EXTENDING FURTHER INTO THE- BAKERSFIELD DOWNTOWN AREA IS REALLY THE IDEA OF. THOSE EIGHTEEN MILES GET THE TRAIN INTO A POPULATED AREA. IN A STATION WHERE CONNECTION POINTS TO LOCAL. A TRANSIT OPTIONS ARE EASILY AVAILABLE AND BUSES TRAVELING FURTHER SOUTH. TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO THE IDEA IS TO MOVE. INTO THE URBAN DOWNTOWN AREA YEAH AND OUT OF THE ORCHARDS THANKS FOR. SIMILARLY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHAT GO BACK ONE PLEASE. THIS IS SIMILARLY IN NORTHERN THE NORTHERN TERMINUS POINT THAT ROAD TWENTY SIX IDENTIFICATION IS THE- CURRENT TERMINUS IN MADERA- IT IS IN A SUBDIVISION AND CLOSE TO. UP A GOLF COURSE AND AGAIN BY EXTENDING THIRTY FIVE MILES NORTH INTO DOWNTOWN MERCED OUR INTENTION IS TO. GO TO THE STATION IN MERCED MEETING THE SAN MARKINGS IN A SYSTEMS THERE THEY GO FURTHER NORTH TO THE BAY AREA IN. SACRAMENTO AND SO AGAIN THESE ARE SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF. MOVING FROM ONE NINETEEN TO ONE SEVENTY ONE GET YOU INTO THE DOWNTOWN URBAN AREAS. WHICH WE THINK MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR. APPLE NEXT TO SLIDE. WE DID EVALUATE SOME QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PEER REVIEW GROUP- BASED ON OUR PROPOSAL TO DO THE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILE STRETCH WE WERE ASKED TO HAVE A INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW OF OUR RIDERSHIP FORECASTS FOR THAT CENTRAL VALLEY. HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILE STRETCH. AND WE ALSO ENTERED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. M. S. N. WORKING JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. FOR TO DEFINE THE INTER SERVICE ROLES OF EACH AGENCY AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND SO WE HAVE A HIGH LEVEL AND- YOU THAT LAYS THOSE OUT. IN THAT INTERVIEW ITSELF CALLS FOR FUTURE MORE SPECIFIC IMHO USES WE GET CLOSER TO OPERATING UP WORKING THROUGH OUR OUR SISTER AGENCIES HERE THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE OPERATING SERVICE- THANKS LIGHT. THE END INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW- ENTITY THAT LOOKED AT OUR COST ESTIMATES THAT ARE A IDERSHIP ESTIMATES. OF FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT- AGAIN WE WERE ASKED BY THE LEGISLATURE WE CONTRACTED WITH RESOURCE SYSTEMS GROUP ARE SG- WORKED WITH THE PEER REVIEW GROUP TO IDENTIFY THEM AND IDENTIFY DOES GO. OF THEIR REVIEW- THAT THIRD PARTY RESEARCH AND ANALYTICS FIRM ASSESSED WHETHER OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND RESULTS REASONABLE. THEIR CONCLUSIONS WERE THEY FOUND NO FATAL FLAWS WITH THE- APPLICATION OF THE MODEL AND THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THAT WE- WE- PUT FORTH LAST YEAR. RIDERSHIP ESTIMATES ARE WITHIN THE RANGE IS FOR TRAVEL TIME. AND FREQUENCY AND IMPORTANTLY THEY CAN CURRENT THAT- OUR APPROACH TO MOVE TO THE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILES IN THE VALLEY. OBTAINS THE HIGHEST FORECAST GAIN IN RIDERSHIP AND DOES SO AT THE LOWEST INCREASE IN COST. A NEXT LIFE. SOME OF THESE STUDIES AN AVERAGE REAFFIRMED VALUE FOR US OF THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD INTERIM SERVICE- THESE EXTENSIONS ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEARED TODAY- AND WE RECOMMEND IT BE DANCING THE DESIGN WHICH WILL INCLUDE. ENGINEERING TO ALLOW US TO GET THE- WORK WITH THE COMMUNITIES AND GET THE PROGRAM ALIGNMENT INTO CONFIGURATION ALLOW US TO. REFINE COST ESTIMATES TO MAP RIGHT AWAY IDENTIFIED UTILITY RELOCATIONS. EXECUTE THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS THAT ESTABLISH AS I SAID EARLIER THE PROJECT CONFIGURATION OF THE PROJECT FOOTPRINT. THIS WILL HELP US REFINE OUR COST ESTIMATES AND PREPARE THESE EXTENSIONS FOR PRE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES NEXT SLIDE- ARE FUNDING ESTIMATES IN THE BUSINESS PLAN WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THIS PROJECT FROM. CURRENT FEDERAL FUNDS. FROM THE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE THE PROGRAM. AND FROM ALL THE REMAINING BOND FUNDS BUT WE HAVE A TOTAL RANGE OF FUNDING AVAILABLE BETWEEN TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY THREE BILLION. R. COSTA SUBMIT TO COMPLETE THAT MERCED BAKERSFIELD LINE IS IN THAT RANGE TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT. BILLION AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE IMMEDIATE ASKED THAT WILL HAVE A THE LEGISLATURE LATER THIS SPRING DURING MAY REVISE. WILL BE TO APPROPRIATE THE REMAINING PROPOSITION ONE A. FUNDS THAT THOSE OF THE BOND FUNDS FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL BOND ACT. OF SO THAT WE MAY COMPLETE THE CONSTRUCTION WORK- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT HUNDRED NINETY MILE SEGMENTS SO THAT WILL BE THE QUESTION THAT WILL SURELY BECOMING FOR THE LEGISLATURE- IN THE MAY REVISE. ONE TIME I. NEXT SLIDE- TO KNOW THAT- WHILE WE CALL INTO ABOUT CHALLENGEFROM THE COPA NINETEEN EXPERIENCE THERE'S ALSO BEEN GREAT PROGRESS ON THIS PROJECT AND THAT THIS CHARGE DESIGNED JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW WE WOULD DANCE. THE FIRST COLUMN IS WHERE WE WERE IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT SECOND COLUMN IN GREEN REFLECTS WHERE WE WERE WHERE ARE AS OF DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY YOU CAN SEE THAT THE TOTALCONSTRUCTION JOBS CREATED BY THIS PROJECT MOSTLY IN. THE CENTRAL VALLEY THESE ARE WHERE WERE ENACTED CONSTRUCTION OF MORE THAN DOUBLED- WE'VE TRIPLED THE NUMBER OF STRUCTURES THAT ARE EITHER COMPLETED OR UNDER CONSTRUCTION WERE MOVING QUICKLY ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL DRAFT DOCUMENTS AT THIS POINT WITH THE DRAFT OUT AND IN CERTIFIED FINAL RODS COMING THIS YEAR. WERE DANCING THE RIGHT AWAY PARCELS AS WELL GETTING THOSE IN HAND IN GETTING TO THE FINAL NUMBER WE NEED FOR CONSTRUCTION AND THE MILES A GUIDE WAY OR UP ABOUT EXPENDITURES THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTS AS THE CONSTRUCTION EXPENSES ALONE HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE LAST THE LAST TWO YEARS SO CERTAINLY THERE'S CHALLENGES BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN IMPORTANT PROGRESS. NEXT TO SLIDE. JUST A QUICK SO OF SOME THAT WE EXPECT ACHIEVE IN THE NEXT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN MONTHS. WE ARE REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL AGREEMENT TO MATCH ALL OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS WE RECEIVED ON THIS. PROJECT WITH STATE FUNDS WERE REQUIRED TO DO THAT BY THE END OF THIS. TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WE LOOKS LIKE WE WILL MEET THAT REQUIREMENT YEAH. IN THIS QUARTER OF THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE- PERHAPS THE SECOND QUARTER BUDGET WE'RE VERY CLOSE RIGHT NOW. OUR SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION OF THE FIRST CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE IN THE VALLEY. IS THE ESTIMATED TO OCCUR FOURTEEN THIRTEEN MONTHS FROM NOW. WE WILL ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEAR EARLY SPRING OR BOARD THE FINAL RODS FOR. BAKERSFIELD TO PALMDALE AND BURBANK TO LA. AND WE LOOK TOWARD OUR TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACTS SO THAT. PRETTY CONSTRUCTION WORK CAN COMMENCE- IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND WE WANT TO ADVANCE THE DESIGN WORK ON THE MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD EXTENSIONS. SO WE GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US THERE NOW BEFORE WE GET INTO. THE CONSTRUCTION ELEMENTS. FINALLY BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR IN DECEMBER WE EXPECT TO HAVE EIGHTY THREE OF NINETY THREE STRUCTURES. EITHER COMPLETED OR UNDER CONSTRUCTION. AND A HUNDRED SIX OF A HUNDRED NINETY MILES OF GUIDEWAY OPEN. FOR WORK THANKS A LOT- THIS JUST AS A SLIDE THAT SHE AGAIN WHERE WE ARE WITHOUT THE STATE MATCH. REQUIREMENT FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS WEEK SPENT WE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE ENTIRETY OF THE MATCH TWO POINT FIVE. BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE- INVOICES MATCHING FEDERAL FUNDS WE RECEIVED THE OPERATE OF LARGELY INTO THE BARGAIN MINISTRATION HAS APPROVED. A ONE POINT FIVE NINE ONE MILLION OF THAT NEARLY ONE POINT SIX BILLION ABOUT SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. AND THEY HAVE- THEY ARE PROCESSING NOW THE REMAINING 36% ABOUT NINE HUNDRED NINE MILLION SO WE ARE ON A- PLANE TO COMPLETE THAT WORK WELL IN ADVANCE OF OUR- NEXT FLIGHT. THE BY THE MINISTRATION CERTAINLY DOES PRESENT A KEY OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS PROJECT AND AN ABILITY. TO RE ESTABLISH A FUNCTIONAL FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP. OF THE AUTHORITY IS ENGAGING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON SEVERAL THINGS. BUT ONE JUST A RESTORATION OF OVERSIGHT- ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND A FULL PARTNERSHIP ON THIS PROJECT- WE'RE LOOKING TO SETTLE LITIGATION. THAT WAS BROUGHT DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHEN. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO D. OBLIGATE. THAT NEARLY A BILLION DOLLARS FROM THIS PROJECT WE TOOK THEM TO COURT. WE ARE NOW IN TALKS TO SETTLE THAT LITIGATION WITH THE F. OR A TODAY. AND WE ARE ALSO SEEKING- UP A LITTLE THE DELIVERY SCHEDULE FLEXIBILITY FROM THE UP ALREADY. SO THAT WE CAN COMPLETE OUR WORK. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY UNDER THE UP PROCESS AND TIMELINES THAT MAKE THE MOST OF BUSINESS SENSE. FOR US. LASTLY WE'RE WORKING WITH CERTAINLY WILL BE WORKING IN OUR WORK TO PROVIDE TEAM ON. IN THE UPPER FOR INCREASED FEDERAL INVESTMENT. ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL NATIONALLY BUT CERTAINLY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE ARE. FUNDING 80% OF THE PROJECT THIS TIME AND ARE LOOKING FOR A LONGER MORE STABLE A FEDERAL COMMITMENT TO THIS PROGRAM. OF COURSE CALIFORNIA'S WILL PREPARE TO BENEFIT. NOT JUST FOR THIS BUT FOR ALL CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. THAT ARE UNDERWAY HERE IN TRANSIT PROGRAMS UNDERWAY HERE WITH THE- REST OF S. B. ONE B. CONTINUE WITH. CAP AND TRADE REVENUES. ALL OF THAT HELPS CALIFORNIA MATCH UP FEDERAL MONEY THAT THEY BE AVAILABLE FREE PRESCRIPTION. EXCELLENT THIS IS JUST A QUOTE THAT JOBS WAS TO US INTO HERE IT'S ALSO APPLY TO PROJECT ARE IT HAPPENS IT ALWAYS SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL IT'S DONE BUT WE CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK IT BASS THE WORK AND- ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING THE PROJECT COMPLETION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAMS CHAIR AND I AM PLEASED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER KELLY WE APPRECIATE THAT THE PRESENTATION AND- WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANELIST WAY BELIEVE IS BRAND ANNIS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR THE AUTHORITY- IF HE WOULD LIKE TO COME ON AND THEN AFTERWARDS WE WILL- BEGIN WITH MEMBER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. YEAH GOOD THAT. SHARES IN COMMITTEE I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER REMARKS BEYOND AT MISTER KELLY'S I AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS SO DURING QUESTION TIME. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER AND S. SO WE'LL OPEN IT UP TO MEMBER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME- WE WANT TO BE DONE. WITH THIS PANEL BY ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK BUT- I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS ARE MIKE'S REYES PLEASE. RAISE YOUR MIKE'S IF YOU'D LIKE TO OKAY SENATOR DOT PLEASE YEAH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT- WE CALL IT AS WE SEE IT HERE YEAH AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR A LONG TIME ON THIS PROJECT IN A COUPLE YEARS AGO WAS NOT FUN TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROJECT. ANYWAYS J. PERFORM. YEAH I JUST THINK- YEAH MISTER- KELLY AND MR ANAS HAVE BROUGHT A NEW VITALITY TO- THE HIGH SPEED RAIL YOUR PROGRAM I'VE GOT- SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CONFIDENCE IN THIS PROGRAM GOING FORWARD THAT I HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME I WAS AN EARLY SUPPORTER- BUT YOU'VE GOT ALL YOU GOT TO LOOK AT THE DATA YOU GOT A LOOK AT THE COST. AT THE END OF THE DAY FOR ME THIS IS ALL ABOUT LEAVING SOMETHING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. AND WHILE IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO SEE IN TERMS OF WHERE THIS WAS GOING TO GO I THINK SENATOR. THE RISE OF SENATE VERY VERY CLEARLY IT DOESN'T HELP. YEAH EVERY AREA IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOW BUT I THINK IN TIME IT WILL ADD- I JUST REALLY WANT TO THANK- MISTER KELLY MR AND IT'S FOR. A JOB WELL DONE IN- KEEP MOVING FORWARD KEEP STAYING ON A BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD I'M GONNA MOVE OVER TO SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I. I GUESS I JUST WANT TO MAYBE BRING A LITTLE COMMON SENSE TO. MAYBE LOW FARMER LOGIC SINCE I'M A FARMER THIS. WHOLE PROJECT IS LIKE A FARMER GOING OUT AND TRYING. TO GROW. SOMETHING THAT'S NEW IN THIS FIELD. ANY IT ENISA HE HAS A GROWN THE HIS TRY SOME NEW BECAUSE IT'S THE NEW WAY. AND- BUT WHEN THE CALL COMES UP IT SNOT JR. WELL IT'S AND IT'S NOT DUE WELL IN AND SO YOU HAVE MAKES A DECISIONS. ALONG THE WAY. I THINK IT'S TIME THIS LARGE TO THIS I MEAN. WE WENT FROM A PROMISING. TWENTY TWENTY HIGH SPEED RAIL AND LOOK IT DOESN'T SERVE ALL STATE I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT LET'S GET IT RIGHT WERE AT. NOW 80% OF THE COST IS ON CALIFORNIANS. MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT WE YOU KNOW PLOW THAT DOWN IN PLANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND TAKE A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. THAT IS BEING USED OUT OF OUR CAP AND TRADE FUNDS AND PUT THEM TO GOOD USE IS WHERE WE KNOW WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB. BUT I KNOW THE VOTERS TO PUT THIS ON THE BALLOT BUT THEY THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED I THINK THEY WERE SOLD SOMETHING THAT. DEFINITELY HAS NOT COME THROUGH. AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO THE LEGISLATURE MAYBE GOES BACK TO THE VOTERS TO FIND OUT IF IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THEY WANT TO. CONTINUE WITH BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. I DON'T BELIEVE. WILL EVER SEE THIS COMPLETED IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A DOUBLE TRACK. AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SINGLE TRACK. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TIMES. FOR TRAINS TO MOVEPEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO MOVE HIM IN THE FACE IN THE FASHION THAT. WAS PROMISED AND SO I THINK IT'S TIME THAT YOU KNOW FOR ME I'M READY TO WALK AWAY FROM IT BEEN READY TO WALK AWAY FOR AWHILE AND I SERVE ON THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND YOU KNOW WE CAN BLAME CODE FOR EVERYTHING BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS ISN'T A COVERT PROBLEM. THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH BEING ABLE TO DELIVER SOMETHING. IN A TIMELY MANNER AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PARTNERS THAT ARE WERE BEING. WE'RE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE. INVESTMENT WE HAVE NOT SEEN AND WE WON'T SEE SO I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE JUST DO A REALITY CHECK HERE MAYBE PLOW THIS BILL DOWN. AND GO TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE- AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE SITTING HERE FOR I GOT THREE MORE YEARS OF THIS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR I'M OUT HERE AND I WILL GUARANTEE YOU. I WOULD BET MY WHOLE FORM ON IT THAT WE WON'T BE WHERE WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO BE TODAY. IN FOUR MORE YEARS. OR IN TEN YEARS. AND THE COST WILL CONTINUE TO RISE IN THERE ALWAYS BE A REASON THAT IT DOESN'T WORK OUT. I THINK THE VOTERS A CALIFORNIA. REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS PROJECT AND I THINK THEY'RE REALLY WAKING UP TO THE FACT. THAT WE CONTINUE. TO JUST LISTEN TO THIS. NARRATIVE THAT IT'S GOING TO. IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOONER. AND IT ISN'T. LET'S BE REAL HERE. SO I JUST WANT TO GET IT ON THE RECORD THAT HATE. THIS PROJECT. IS A BOONDOGGLE. AND IS NOT GOING TO DO WHAT. THEY SAY IT'S GOING TO DO. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I THINK WE SHOULD JUST SCRAP THIS WHOLE PROCESS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY FOR COMMENTS I BELIEVE US SENATOR NEWMAN. DID YOU HAVE YOUR MAKE UP I DO THAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR BY I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE CENTER DIED. AND SENATOR RISE SO- I APPRECIATE. SENATOR DONNELLY'S COMMENTS- I THINK IT'S ALSO TRUE. THAT WE ARE NOT WHERE WE WANTED TO BE- BUT WE ARE FULLY INVESTED AS A STATE IN THIS PROJECT. THAT WE ARE IN FACT MAKING PROJECT PROGRESS. THE AND IS SENATOR DODD MENTIONED WE ARE IN GOOD HANDS- WAS SECRETARY. A KELLY- AND BRIAN ANDERSON- AND SO WE NEED TO. THE NONE OF US SEE THE- OF THIS PROJECT DURING A TERMS IN OFFICE. BUT THE STATE WILL. AND OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES THANK YOU MENTION. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN SENATOR AKOWSKI. R. D. THE REPORT POINTS OUT THAT THE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN SEGMENT. WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BE BEYOND THE FUNDING FROM THE PROP ONE A. R. A AND THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS AT THE PIER THIRTY ONE OF THE SLIDES THAT YOU HAD UPSET THAT MIGHT BE THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE WITHIN THE IF WE HAD IF WE HIT THE OLD LOW AMOUNT. PUTTING ASIDE ANY ASSISTANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE. THE N. ACCEPTING THE. THE REPORT THAT PRIVATE INVESTMENT IS PROBABLY AT BEST THREE OR FIVE YEARS OFF WHAT. MAY YOU SAY ABOUT THE NEW STATE SOURCES OF FUNDING WHICH THE REVIEW IDENTIFIES AS A GAS TAX SALES TAX VEHICLE TEXTURE TEXT EXCEPT THE ROCK CENTER- THAT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF FUNDING AND WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD BE YOUR PITCH SAID LEGISLATURE. WELL FIRST I WANT TO JUST CLARIFY A POINT I THINK THAT B. THE ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR BUSINESS PLAN DOES NOT RELY. ON NEW SOURCES OF STATE REVENUE FOR THE MADERA TO BAKERSFIELD STRETCH THERE ARE AND WE DO ARE CLEAR THAT WE NEED EVERY DIME WE HAVE TO BUILD THAT THAT SEGMENT. AND ONE OF THE REASONS I HEARD IT MENTIONED THAT- YOU KNOW IT'S NOW A ONE TRACK SYSTEM AGAIN I WANT TO BE CLEAR ULTIMATELY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM WILL BE A TWO TRACK. SYSTEM BUT THE QUESTION IS AND THE APPROACH HERE IS TO WORK TOWARD AN OPERATING SEGMENT IN A WAY THAT WORKS WITHIN OUR BUDGET AND BELOW TODAY. WE HAVE A KNOWN ESTIMATE OF REVENUE BETWEEN TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY THREE BILLION. DOLLARS AND OUR INTENTION IS TO- PUT IN PLACE AN OPERATING SEGMENT BETWEEN CITIES THAT. CAN BE DONE FOR THAT UP THAT MAY MEAN THAT WE FACED THE TRACK WE'RE GOING TO HELP OUR BIDDERS. INCLUDING IN THEIR BIDS WHAT EACH ELEMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE TRACK NOW THE SECOND TRACK LATER VERSES TO TRACKS NOW SO WE CAN MAKE AN EDUCATED DECISION- BUT WE ARE NOT. I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR ANY ADDITIONAL. THEY FUNDING ONE OF THE THAT WE SAY THIS BUSINESS PLAN AND WE SAID IN PRIOR BUSINESS PLANS. BECAUSE WE GET A PORTION OF CAP AND TRADE FUNDS NOW. MAKING THAT REVENUE SOURCE MORE STABLE AND SECURE IS IMPORTANT. SO IF THE LEGISLATURE AND ONE OF THE MOST STABILIZING THINGS THE LEGISLATURE EVER DID. FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WAS EXTENDED TO TWENTY THIRTY. IF THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL EXTENSION- THIS PROJECT WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY FROM. THE ABILITY TO FINANCE OFF OF THAT REVENUE. STREAM SO WE CAN BRING DOLLARS FORWARD SOONER. AND SO AN EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY WOULD BE STABILIZING. THE ABILITY TO FINANCE OFFER THAT WOULD BE STABILIZING. THAT WOULD CERTAINLY ALLEVIATE ANY BUDGET UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE MERCED BAKERSFIELD. STRETCH TODAY. YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT NEW. FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR- FROM STATE RESOURCES FOR THIS PROJECT. I CANDIDLY WOULD WAIT AND SEE WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ON THIS- I DISAGREE WITH THE. THE CHARACTERIZATION THAT THE PROJECT HAS NOT GOTTEN ARE NOT SOUGHT OR RECEIVED HELP FROM OTHER SOURCES WE HAVE RECEIVED THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THIS PROJECT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE BUYING TEAM TO ENSURE WE KEEP EVERY DIME OF THAT. AND I THINK AS WE GO FORWARD CALIFORNIA ALL OF US POLICY MAKERS ME MY BOARD. THIS GOVERNOR WE WOULD ALL BENEFIT FROM UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ON THIS TECHNOLOGY IN THIS PROGRAM. GOING FORWARD BEFORE I WOULD SEEK ADDITIONAL. STATE RESOURCES BEYOND WHAT'S ALREADY DEDICATED TO THE PROGRAM. BOB THANK YOU MISTER KELLY THANK YOU SENATOR AKOWSKI OGLE- NEXT TO SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MISTER KELLY I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO SIT DOWN WITH ME EARLIER THIS WEEK ON SOON- TO GO OVER THIS. I'M NEW TO THIS ISSUE- I HAVE TO ADMIT IS A FORMER NON ELECTED AS A LAY PERSON I WAS STRUCK BY THE HIGH COSTS. WE'VE ALL READ ABOUT- IT THE SOARING COSTS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IN- I APPRECIATED YOUR EXPLANATION MEAN I WAS HOPING YOU JUST MIGHT REPEAT THAT IN BRIEF. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WERE THE COST DRIVERS HE MAIN LESSONS YOU TOOK AWAY FROM OUR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO CORRECT THAT. THANK YOU CENTER I WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION. A LOT WE HAVE. THE FIRST BUSINESS PLAN I PUT OUT SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AT AN ENTIRE CHAPTER IN A COLD SWEAT LESSONS LEARNED. AND THE KEY LESSON LEARNED ON THIS PROJECT WAS. WHEN CONSTRUCTION FIRST STARTED THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE TO SPEND. THE AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDS AND I SHOULD SAY THAT AT THAT TIME. BECAUSE OF LITIGATION THE AUTHORITY DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER STATE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE PROJECT. SO WE HAD DID THEY THEY HAD TO RELY AT THAT TIME ON AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ALSO HAD. A SPECIFIC DEADLINE BY WHICH THOSE HAD TO BE SPENT- AND SO WE GOT THEY GOT A NEW CONSTRUCTION A LITTLE AT A SEQUENCE IS HOW I WOULD DESCRIBE- IT MEANS THAT THEY STARTED CONSTRUCTION WHERE THEY COULD- BUT IT WAS A BIT AT RISK. AND WHEN I SAY THAT RISK I MEAN. THEY GOT INTO CONSTRUCTION BEFORE THE ENTIRETY OF THE- SEGMENTS WERE FULLY DESIGNED. FOR ALL THE RIGHT AWAY NEEDS WERE UNDERSTOOD. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT OVER TIME- THERE'S BEEN SCHEDULE DELAYS AS CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR RIGHT AWAY. AND AS DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS HAVE BEEN FURTHER FURTHER REVIEW- I WILL SAY THAT THOSE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS ARE. NOT JUST THE- FAULT OF ANYONE PARTY BUT WHEN YOU DESIGN AND PUT IN PLACE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS YOU NEGOTIATE. WITH LOCAL PARTNERS CITIES AND COUNTIES THE FREIGHT UTILITIES AND OTHERS WHO ALL PUSH FOR VARIOUS GO CHANGES. THOSE WERE NOT ALL IN PLACE AT THAT TIME WHEN I STARTED HERE. THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT WAS HOW MUCH RIGHT AWAY YOU ACTUALLY NEED. WHEN YOU'RE ONLY THAT FAR ALONG. TODAY WE ARE WE NEED. TO GET TO CONSTRUCTION AND FINISH THIS WORK- AND WE ARE NOW OPERATING IN A WAY. TO GET THAT DONE THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE WERE ON THIS PROJECT AND HOW IT GOT STARTED. TODAY AS I SAID WE HAVE THE RIGHT AWAY BETTER IN HAND. WE ARE NEARLY A 100% DESIGN WILL BE BY APRIL- AND GOING FORWARD. TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES CHAPTER SIX OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN. TALKS ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE. A ONE IS AN ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR THE AUTHORITY. WILL DO MORE DISCIPLINED WORK ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT RISKS. ARE IN FRONT OF IT. THE WORST AVERAGING A RISK COMMITTEE THAT WILL REPORT PUBLICLY TO OUR BOARD. ABOUT WHERE WE SEE RISKS AND WHAT MITIGATION MEASURES WERE PUTTING IN IN PLACE SOONER- AND SECONDLY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. AS WE GET INTO THE FUTURE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS- WE ARE INSTIGATING SOMETHING CALLED A STAGE GATE. PROCUREMENT PROCESS WHICH MEANS. WE WILL ONLY DO THIS IN METHODICAL SORT OF INCREMENTAL PIECES. THE FIRST IS TO GET THE DESIGN WORK FURTHER ADVANCED. IDENTIFY THE RIGHT AWAY THAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE UTILITIES THAT NEED TO BE RELOCATED. AND DO THOSE THINGS FIRST. THEN WE'LL MOVE TO WHAT WE CALL THE EARLY WORKS WHICH IS ACTUALLY STARTING TO PROCURE. THAT RGHT AWAY AND STARTING TO EXECUTE THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS AND START TO MOVE- THE- UTILITIES THAT NEED TO BE MOVED- AND THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL WE GET INTO. A CONSTRUCTION A PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS AND SO CONSTRUCTION WILL NOT COMMENCE AT RISK LIKE IT DID BEFORE. YEAH AND- WE WILL MOVE FORWARD IN A MUCH MORE METHODICAL WAY THAT I THINK WE'LL HAVE THIS NOT REPEAT. THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST. THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND THAT MR KELLY IN THAT- I THINK YOU HAVE A SWEET A LOT OF MY CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE A LOT OF MISTAKES MADE PREVIOUSLY WITH THIS PROJECT. I'LL THIS EDITORIALIZED DURING SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THIS COUNTRY AND THIS STATE USED TO BE KNOWN FOR ITS LEADERSHIP ON INFRASTRUCTURE WE CREATED THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS A CLASS OF THE WORLD. AND NOW WE'RE SAYING THAT SOMETHING OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING THAT IS STANDARD ACROSS THE WORLD. IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN'T DO. AND TO ME THAT'S NOT AMERICAN WAY THAT'S NOT THIS. THAT MAY THIS KIND AFTER SUPERPOWER THAT IT IS AND TO BUILD ON THE ANALOGY USED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER. I DON'T THINK AMERICA IN CALIFORNIA GOT TO WHERE WE ARE BY GIVING UP BECAUSE THEY CROP DIDN'T SUCCEED. WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE BY LEARNING FROM OUR LESSONS IN OUR MISTAKES. AND SAY WE CAN'T DO THIS WE HAVE A PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW THAT WANTS TO BUILD FIRST CLASS INFRASTRUCTURE UNITED STATES. A WE HAVE A SPARE RIGHT NOW THAT SAYS WE CAN'T DO THIS. AND WE WANT TO LEAVE SOMETHING BEHIND BUILDING ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA'S ANALOGY. WE WANT TO LEAVE SOMETHING MEANING FOR THAT FOR NEXT GENERATION THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY. IF WE STAY WITH THE STATUS QUO WE'RE LEAVING BEHIND TRAFFIC AND GRIDLOCK. AND HIGH GHG EMITTING INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO REALLY MAKE CALIFORNIA A LEADER AGAIN SO I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR MEN AND GREAT QUESTION IT'S REALLY GOOD TO HEAR ABOUT THE RISK MITIGATION COMMITTEE- AND THE WORK THEY WILL DO AHEAD SO. I'M GOING O GO NEXT TO SENATOR RUBIO- AND THEN TO UP TO TWO OTHER SENATORS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND DIVE WANTED JUST LINE MY COMMENTS WITH THE SENATOR FROM- MISTER MAN I JUST WANTED TO THINK- FIRST OF ALL THE CHAIR IN THE YOU KNOW CO CHAIR FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LEARN ABOUT IT- AND I UNDERSTAND ALL THE CONCERNS UP AND STATED AS A PERTAINS TO A FUNDING ISSUE SCHEDULING ISSUES DESIGN ISSUES BY THE END OF THE DAY I THINK THAT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW WE'VE CERTAINLY NEED CONNECTIVITY ACROSS THE STATE WE NEED SPEED. AND THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES BUT AT THE SAME TIME T IS STILL IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE SO MANY GOOD PAYING JOBS AND IT WILL DEFINITELY- AND VITALITY TO OUR ECONOMY ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED IT BUT YOU KNOW I WANTED TO YOU KNOW SHARE I KNOW THAT MANY HAVE STATED THAT WE WILL NOT ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROJECT AND WE MAY NOT SEE IT BUT YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT HISTORY WE HAVE PROJECTS THAT HAVE DEALT WITH RESISTANCE YOU KNOW LIKE THE SIXTEEN CHAPEL THERE WAS RESISTANCE THERE BUT YET GENERATIONS HAVE ENJOYED YOU KNOW THE BEAUTY OF WHAT IS THE SIXTEENTH CHAPEL NOW INSULT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS NOT NECESSARY FOR US BUT- WE DEFINITELY WANT TO LEAVE SOMETHING FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO BE ABLE TO. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUT I DO HAVE ONE PARTICULAR QUESTION IF I MAY- UM I KNOW WE'VE HEARD ALL THE RESISTANCE ON THE CONCERNED AND THEY'RE VALID IS THERE ANY PUBLIC CAMPAIGN THAT'S PLANNED TO EDUCATE CALIFORNIANS SHARE WHAT'S GOING ON AS A PERTAINS TO THIS PROJECT ENGAGE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES. CAN SOMEONE ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SEE WHAT RUBIO DISTRICT MR GALLAGHER HAD. I APOLOGIZE- I WILL DO THAT YEAH. THE BEST I CAN TO SORT OF ANSWER THAT YOU KNOW WE- YUP WE HAVE AN EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH A PROCESS- OUR YOU KNOW ODDLY AND BENEFICIALLY THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS IS ALSO. A WAY THAT WE ENGAGE WITH THE COMMUNITIES ON WHERE WE ARE BUT I WANTED AND SO THERE'S A CONSTANT AND CONTINUOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP. AS IT GETS BEYOND THE VALLEY IN THE BAY AREA AND INTO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION WE DO A LOT OF WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND- CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ON STATION PLANNING. A WHICH IS. A BIG AND IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND OBVIOUSLY A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR FUTURE OPERATIONAL. SYSTEM WE ALSO PROVIDE- THROUGH OUR WEBSITE A SERIES OF. DATA A POINTS THINGS LIKE- UPDATES ON WHERE WE ARE WE DO HAVE CONSTRUCTION UPDATE- VIDEO OF THAT WE UPDATE CONSTANTLY- THERE ARE SERIES OF VIDEOS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND YOU TO BETTER WEBSITE. ABOUT THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE PROJECT- AND SO THERE'S A SORT OF A CONTINUING. EFFORT TO EXPAND THE WORD. AS WE ADVANCE THAT CAN FURTHER IN THE VALLEY- YOU THEY'LL BE MORE MORE. EVIDENCE OF THAT AND OF COURSE WE ALSO REPORT PUBLICLY WHERE WE ARE AT EACH OF OUR BOARD HEARINGS EACH MONTH INVITE THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE- AND THE REPORTS THAT WE ISSUE TO THE LEGISLATURE EACH YEAR. A PROVIDE A CONSTANT UPDATE OF WHERE WE ARE SO THERE'S- SEVERAL THINGS WE BRING TO THIS- I THINK AS WE- ARE IN THE COMING MONTHS FORMULATE A CLEAR. A PICTURE WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS I THINK YOU'LL BE. THE REASON HAND AND EVIDENCE OF HIGHLIGHTED- SORT OF. A PROGRESS GOING FORWARD AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE BEST I CAN SAY ABOUT IT AT THIS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AGAIN AND I THAT'S YOU'RE DOING FANTASTIC WORK IN TERMS OF REACHING OUT BUT- YOU KNOW ORDINARY CITIZENS SOMETIMES DON'T GET THE BENEFIT OF THIS INFORMATION UNLESS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT AND I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT. AT SOME POINT TO FIGURE OUT A STRATEGIC PLAN TO ENSURE THAT. THE ORDINARY CITIZEN HERE'S THIS INFORMATION AND REALLY UNDERSTANDS THE BENEFIT TO. CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE BUT I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU VENTURE. TO ME JUST SAY. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR CAL ABILITY JUST SAY. OF FIRST OF ALL THAT- I DO BELIEVE THAT ALTERNATELY- THE VISION FOR FUTURE SHOULD INCLUDE. THIS PROJECT AS ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED- I AND I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF COMPETITIVENESS FOR. OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN I'D AGREE WITH- CENTER NEWMAN'S- NOTION THAT THE THIS IS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING. WE SEE TO FRUITION PER IN OUR TENURE NECESSARILY. IT'S GOING TO BE LOOKED AT AS- WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT OUR GRANDCHILDREN TO BE COMPETING. WITH THOSE. CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE THEY'VE SUCCESSFULLY CONNECTED MAJOR ACADEMIC CENTERS A MAJOR ECONOMIC CENTERS- WITH WITH THIS KIND OF HIGH SPEED TECHNOLOGY THAT SAID- SENATOR DOLLARS COMMENTS ABOUT THE MOOD OF THE STATE IN THE DISRUPTIONS OF THE PROJECT ARE WELL TAKEN. AND WHEN I LISTEN TO THE PRESENTATION- HAVING BEEN A LOCAL OFFICIAL. A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS AND LOCAL TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. CERTAINLY TRACKING THIS PROJECT ALONG. IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW A DECISION. LIKE THE END POINT OF THE PROJECT BEING IN AN ORCHARD OR IN DOWNTOWN BAKERSFIELD. TAKES THIS LONG TO MAKE. IN IN IN JUST I HEARD. ESADE AND REITERATE YOU KNOW THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN THERE'S A NEW- THERE'S NEW LEADERSHIP- DESIGN IS NOW ADVANCED- BUT THAT'S THAT'S AN- AWFUL LONG TIME TO. TAKE TO MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL DECISION AS TO WERE. THE START POINT STOPPED PLANNING IS FOR THE PROJECT SPECIALLY WHEN THE CHOICES ARE THAT STARK IN THAT OBVIOUS. SO MY QUESTION IS WHICH I THINK IS ON THE MIND OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WHAT ASSURANCE CAN YOU GIVE US. IN AN ETHNIC I KNOW PART OF THE ANSWER IS. HI BRIAN KELLY I'M HERE NOW. BUT THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT GO WELL BEYOND THE TENURE NOT ONLY OF THE SENATE BUT OF THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE RUNNING THE PROJECT NOW WHAT ASSURANCE CAN YOU GIVE US. THAT THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE NOT GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH NOT JUST CHANGE ORDERS BUT CHANGE OF DESIGN AND CHANGE OF VISION OF THE PROJECT. I THANK YOU SENATOR I APPRECIATE THAT THE QUESTION. YOU KNOW I THINK THE CHALLENGE DOZENS OF FIRST I WANT TO ESTABLISH- WHY WHY THERE'S THE HUNDRED NINETY MILE FOOTPRINT THE FIRST. UP THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT- APPLIED FOR VARIOUS SEGMENTS TO START CONSTRUCTION ON THIS PROJECT AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE FRA IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME AWARDED A CALIFORNIA TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS TO START UP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT WHERE WE STARTED- THAT WAS BECAME DEFINED IN AGREEMENTS. BETWEEN THE AUTHORITY THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO THAT INITIAL STRETCH THAT HUNDRED NINETY MILES WAS THE FIRST CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRED- CALIFORNIA TO COMMENCE- TO DO WORK ON AND TO- TO DEVELOP. YEAH AND THAT IS THEWORK THAT WE HAVE HAD. UNDER WAY- SINCE THAT SINCE THAT INITIAL AGREEMENT CNSTRUCTION COMMENCED WITH A UP GROUND BREAKING IN IN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SO UNDER OUR FEDERAL FUNDING AGREEMENT. WE GOTTA FINISH THE CIVIL WORKS THAT HUNDRED NINETEEN WE HAVE TO LAY A TRACK ON THAT HUNDRED NINETEEN AND WE FINISH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK EVERYWHERE STATEWIDE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LA AND ANAHEIM- SO. THE CALL HAS BECOME WHAT WE DO BEYOND THAT ONE NINETY BECAUSE THAT HUNDRED NINETEEN. THAT PICTURE I USED IN THE PRESENTATION WAS DESIGNED TO SHOW YOU KNOW IT IS NOT. THE PREMIER OPERATING SEGMENT- THE END SO YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU DO BE ON YOUR FEDERAL MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS AND DO YOU HAVE FUNDING. TO GET A BETTER OPERATIONAL RUN GOING- BEAMER SAID TO BAKERSFIELD- CONTEMPLATION IS HAS GONE THROUGH NOW ANALYSIS AND PEER REVIEW IT'S ESTIMATED TO NEARLY DOUBLE THE SYSTEM WIDE RIDERSHIP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TODAY WITH JUST THE SAN JOAQUIN'S. UP SERVICE IT'S THERE. AND IT WILL REDUCE TRAVEL TIME SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE RIDERSHIP SIGNIFICANTLY SO IT WAS US YOU KNOW ARE COMING FORWARD WITH HOW DO WE GET SOMETHING THAT'S OPERATIONALLY BETTER- INSTILL. YOU KNOW WE HOPE ACHIEVABLE- IN IN THE BUDGET WE HAVE WHAT WHAT WE ALSO LIVE WITH A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND I WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS. YOU KNOW OUR CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS ARE HAVE BEEN BOLA TIE WITH CERTAIN TIME CERTAINLY BEFORE WE EXTENDED IT TO. TWENTY THIRTY WAS ALL THE TILE AND CERTAINLY THE UNEXPECTED GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND IMPACT ON THOSE BUT IF THOSE DAYS STATE STABLE- AND WE RECEIVE THAT FUNDING BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY- WE DO FEEL LIKE WE CAN GET AN OPERATION RUN. IT GOING BETWEEN MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD AS THE FIRST BUILDING BLOCK AND I GUESS THAT'S THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE. THIS IS NOT THE END OF THE SYSTEM IT'S THE B. BEGINNING. LIKE MOST TRANSIT SYSTEMS AROUND. YOU KNOW TAKE BART IN THE BAYAREA YOU KNOW INITIALLY BAR WAS FUNDED AND CONSTRUCTED AS A MOSTLY EAST BAY INTO SAN FRANCISCO COMMUTER SEGMENT. NOW IT TOUCHES UP. MORE CHARGES WERE EVERY AIRPORT IN THE BAY AREA AND EXTENDS NOW INTO SENATE CLEARANCE AND WE SAN JOSE. IT IS NOW GOING ALL THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS ARE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THEY WERE AFTER THEIR FIRST BUILDING BLOCK. SO SIMILAR WE ARE CONSTRAINED BY BUDGET. AND WE HAVE TO ARTICULATE WHAT THE NEXT SEGMENT PIECES ARE. WE GET A LONG TERM FEDERAL FUNDING PARTNER ON THIS. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING INTO THE BAY AREA SOONER- BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN RIDERSHIP NUMBERS REALLY. GO NORTH. NAY IN A BIG WAY- BUT WE HAVE ENOUGH TO GET AN OPERATING SEGMENT GOING NOW- WHAT I CAN. YOU KNOW I DON'T MAKE GUARANTEES BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT- I WILL ALWAYS EXPRESS IN A TIMELY WAY WHAT ARE. THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES ARE. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO GET THIS OPPORTUNITY SEGMENT GOING IN THE VALLEY. AND WILL. USE OUR BEST JUDGMENT GOING FORWARD ABOUT HOW TO ACHIEVE THAT. KNOWING THAT ULTIMATELY WE'RE STILL HEADED. FOR A SAN FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES RUN. THAT CAN MOVE PEOPLE BETWEEN THOSE TWO POINTS IN UNDER THREE HOURS. WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE WE ONLY HAVE SO MUCH BUDGET TODAY. AND WE'RE APPLYING THAT BUDGET IN A WAY TO GET AN OPERATING RUN GOING AS SOON AS WE CAN. RECOGNIZING THAT WE THEN WANT TO EXPAND OUT TO FULFILL THE VISION THAT WAS IN. THE. BOND FUND FROM A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER KELLY SENATOR DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. RIGHT I DO BUT WITH RESPECT TO YOUR ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS- ALL HOLD OFF THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTIONS- SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR. I THINK BRINGING US ALL TOGETHER- AND OBVIOUSLY- WITH THE- THE CHAIR AND ON THE BUDGET- SENATOR RUSSELL JIM FORTIN YOUR COMMENT. AND IT HOME BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO MY QUESTION IS- MANY BUT YOU ANSWERED SO MANY IT WHAT A GREAT PRESENTATION. YOU AND LIKE MAY ON WHERE WE ARE IN OUR STATUS MISTER KELLY THE THING IS THAT I THINK PERCEPTION VERSUS FACT. THE PERCEPTION YOU'VE HEARD THE NEGATIVE- YOU CAN HEAR AND FEEL THE POSITIVE. BUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS LOOKING FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TO BE COMPLETED AND WHEN. AND AS AN EXAMPLE WHEN YOU STARTED THERE WAS A- MENTION OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT. WAS LOST BECAUSE OF PANDEMIC BUT IT'LL BE MADE UP. MY QUESTION IS HOW- AND HOW QUICKLY CAN WE GO AHEAD AND NOW XCELERATED. THE CONSTRUCTION ACCELERATE- THE OVERALL PLANS NOW THAT WE'RE CLOSING THE DOOR ON THE PANDEMIC HOPEFULLY SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND I'M NOT ASKING FOR FIVE OR TEN BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WHILE. TO LOOK BACK AT THE PANDEMIC AND RECOVER FROM IT SO GIVE ME AN IDEA OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND FINISH WITH- HOW IT CAN HELP THE SOUTHERN% CALIFORNIA ISSUES- WITH TRANSPORTATION AS WE'RE GOING ALONG. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THINK THE FIRST ISSUE I WOULD ADDRESS WAS THE QUESTION ABOUT THE- CAP AND TRADE REVENUE WE DID TAKE A HIT IN TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE THE OPTIONS. PARTICULARLY THE SINGULAR AUCTION RIGHT AFTER THEY OPEN. A PANDEMIC STRUCK IN MARCH OF TWENTY. I THINK THAT SUBSEQUENT AUCTION WAS MAY AND IN THAT ARE SHOULD WE- RECEIVED ONLY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PROJECT OUT OF THAT ARCHER. NOW TYPICALLY WE HAD BEEN ON A PACE WHERE WE WERE RECEIVING MORE LIKE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION PER AUCTION. AND IN THAT WHEN WE GET SIX SO. SUBSEQUENT AUCTIONS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER THE CAP AND TRADE MARKET IS STABILIZING. YEAH BY EVIDENCE OF THE SUBSEQUENT AUCTIONS THAT ARE BROUGHT THE- REVENUE BACK. TO OUR PROGRAM HEADING BACK TO WHERE IT WAS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. THE REASON WE SAY WE ULTIMATELY WILL MAKE UP A LARGE PART OF THAT TWO EIGHTY EIGHT THAT WAS LOST. IS THE WAY THE ARCH INWARDS WORKS THESE ALLOWANCES- GET SOLD WHAT HAPPENED ON THE IMMEDIATE- THE IMMEDIATE AUCTION AFTER THE COVERT NINETEEN WAS THAT. THOSE ALLOWANCES DID NOT GET SOLD- HOWEVER. OVER TIME AS LONG AS THE AUCTIONS AND I'M NOT NOT THIS REALLY THE EXPERT IN THIS MARKET MECHANICS. BUT AS THOSE AS ALL AVAILABLE ALLOWANCE ALLOWANCES GETS SOLD IN THE AUCTION PROCESS. YOU CAN GO BACK AND YOU CAN SELL. SELL AND BUY UP ALLOWANCES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ON SO. AND SO OUR EXPECTATION JUST AS WE- SAW SAW BEFORE- IS THAT GOING FORWARD- THE ALLOWANCES WILL. GET SOLD. AND WE WILL MAKE UP THE LOS. A TWO EIGHTY A SO IT IT DOES PRESENT A IS A FLOW. IT'S TELLING EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAS WITH WE'D HAVE THE BANK. TODAY WE DO NOT AND SO AGAIN THE WAY THE MARKET MECHANISM WORKS WE SEE THAT GETTING THAT OVER TIME WITH THE ALLOWANCES GETS ALL. IN TERMS OF DESCRIBING HOW THINGS WILL LOOK OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT. YOU YEARS AYE AYE I WOULD SAY THIS- YOU WILL SEE IS COMPLETE. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS YOU WILL SEE IS COMPLETE. THE CONSTRUCTION WORK THAT IS UNDERWAY CURRENTLY IN THE VALLEY THE HUNDRED NINETY MILE. CONSTRUCTION WORK WILL GET DONE. WE WILL COMMENCE THE WORK TO LAY DOWN A TRACKWE BELIEVE THAT TRACK. SHOULD BE ELECTRIFIED IN PREPARED. FOR A LECTURE ELECTRIFIED SERVICES. BOB WE HAVE TWO BIDDERS THAT ARE OUT IN THE MARKET NOW. THAT ARE BIDDING ON DOING THE TRACKING SYSTEMS WORK. AND OUR BOARD WILL RECEIVE THOSE BIDS LATER THIS YEAR. AND WE WILL EVALUATE HOW TO GO FORWARD ON THOSE OUR HOPE. IS THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING HAVING THEM BIT IT. AS ONE TRACK FIRST AND A SECOND TRACK LATER- THAT IS A WAY TO SAVE SHORT TERM DOLLARS. AND GET AN OPERATIONAL SYSTEM GOING- BUT WE WANT TO COMPARE WHAT THOSE COST DIFFERENCES WILL BE. THE IDEA IS TO TAKE A CAREFUL APPROACH ON THIS. AND DO THIS METHODICALLY- AT THE SAME TIME YOU WILL ALSO SEE THE COURSE THE NEXT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS US COMPLETE. THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK FROM SAN FRANCISCO ALL THE WAY TO LA AND ANAHEIM. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE BECAUSE WHEN WE DO THAT. WE CAN THEN START ON ALL THE SEGMENTS TO ADVANCE THE DESIGN WORK EARLY. A START TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE NEEDS ARE IN EACH SEGMENT. AND WHEN I SAY NEEDS I MEAN. RIGHT AWAY MAKING SURE THE DESIGN IS MOVING FORWARD IN A PLACE IN A WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH COMMUNITY WANTS. BUT AGAIN IDENTIFYING FUTURE RIGHT AWAY WHAT UTILITIES NEED TO BE RELOCATED- WHAT KIND OF THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS DO WE HAVE TO ENTER INTO. TO GET THAT WORK DONE. AND REALLY AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. ALLOWING US TO DO THAT TRYING TO WORK SO THAT WE CAN REFINE COST ESTIMATES AND YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT WHEN YOU ADVANCE THE DESIGN. FURTHER AND SO THOSE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT STEPS WILL BE TAKING IN EACH SEGMENT. AS THE ENVIRONMENT WORK. COMPLETES I WANT TO DO I DO WANT TO SAY THIS ABOUT THE STATEWIDE BENEFITS. MISTER KELLY WE COULD JUST BE A LITTLE BIT BRIEF WE HAVE THREE MORE MEMBERS WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK AND WE NEED WE NEED TO TURN OVER YOUR NEXT PANEL SORRY ABOUT THAT. OVERALL I JUST WHICH WOULD SAY THAT THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE ECONOMIC STATEWIDE BENEFITS. FROM THE WORK WE HAVE GOING A LONG. STATEWIDE RIGHT NOW WE ARE MAKING INVESTMENTS IN PROJECTS IN THE BAY AREA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. TODAY THE ADDAMS OUT OF OUR PROGRAM- AND THAT- THAT ALSO HAS INVESTMENTS FOR EXAMPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TODAY- WE'VE- IDENTIFIED MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND JOB YEARS OF CONSTRUCTION AND ONE POINT THREE BILLION. IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT IT'S TRUE THE MOBILITY BENEFITS WILL COME WHEN WE ACTUALLY GET THERE LATER BUT THERE ARE IMPORTANT STATEWIDE BENEFITS THE PROGRAM. NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER KELLY MR TWO LETTER. UP YOU MENTIONED SINGLETRACK VERSUS DOUBLE TRACK THE SINGLE TRACK GIVE ME AN IDEA HOW THAT ARE TO LET IF WE CAN- JUST. KEEP IT TO ONE QUESTION FOR EACH MEMBER WE HAVE. THREE MORE MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK I'M SORRY TO CUT YOU- ARE YOU I CHAU. OKAY I'M SORRY THAT THE YOU VERY- AND WE'RE A LITTLE LATE ON TIME. NEXT PANELS- WILL GO TO OUR NEXT FEW MEMBERS. I WILL GO TO VICE CHAIR BATES. THANK YOU UN. ON MADAM PRESIDENT OF THE GERMAN- OF IN VERY QUICK TIME I'M ON THE SINGLE TRACK ISSUE ALSO THAT I THINK SENATOR ARCHULETA. WANTED TO BRING UP AND- MY QUESTION IS PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GET BACK TO US ON BET. THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT PLAN FOR YOUR GOING TO COMPLETE THIS SEGMENT. WAS JUST ONE TRACK. ABA MAKES SOME SENSE TO CUT THE COSTS BUT AS WE GO FORWARD. AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE'LL BE LOOKING AT OPERATIONS SITUATION. AND I AM CONCERNED THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO CONSIDER THIS HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE WRITERS TO BE ON IT. AND THOSE REVENUES WILL BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT. IN TAKING A LOOK AT THE REDUCTION OF THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT. AND ALSO OPERATIONS GOING FORWARD. SO IT'S SOMETHING I THINK OF NOT TODAY I'D LIKE TO HAVE A FURTHER. DISCUSSION ON THE SITUATION. THAT IS PROCESS PRESENTS ITSELF WITH JUST ONE TRACK. ALSO IN TERMS OF OUR- WRITERS OUT THERE ARE TAXPAYERS. A CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO. AN ALTERNATE. TRAVEL MOTIF ALL CROSS THE STATE. OUR THIS IS HARDLY GOING TO MEET I THINK WITH THE PROMISE WAS. SO I THINK MOE EXPLANATION. ON THAT IS DUE US AND- I WILL. ASK THE CHAIRMAN IF WE MIGHT PUT THAT FORWARD BECAUSE TODAY'S NOT THE- PROBABLY PROPER PLACE TO DISCUSS. CAPITAL VERSUS OPERATIONS THOSE ARE ALWAYS MAJOR MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH RAIL. NOT ONLY IN OUR STATE BUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU- MADAM VICE CHAIR I APPRECIATE THAT SO WILL- LEAVE THAT ON HOLD FOR NOW FOR A AT LEADER DISCUSSION I'LL- NEXT. GO TO CHAIRED RUSSELL- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF. I THINK THAT THERE ARE. WE CAN BE DONE BY THE- EXCITEMENT AND THE INSPIRATION OF HAVING THE US STATE OF A STATE WIDE A PROJECT LIKE THIS BEING COMPLETED AND I DO BELIEVE IN DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE BUT I ALSO BELIEVE IN THE- THE REALISTIC SIDE OF MAKING SURE THAT WE DO THE IMPOSSIBLE- IT APPEARS THAT. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WERE WERE SORT OF HOPING AND PRAYING THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A OF WELCOMING ADMINISTRATION AS THE BY THE MINISTRATION THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE GOING TO GET FUNDING THERE WE KNOW THAT CAP AND TRADE AS BALA TILE- I JUST DON'T SEE THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED US. A PLAN THAT ON THE ONE HAND STILL ASSUMES COMPLETION OF THE VALLEY TO VALLEY LINE BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE AND THE SERVICES GO TO LA BY TWENTY THIRTY THREE I HAVEN'T HEARD YET REALLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE AND HOW YOU GONNA MEET SUCH AN AMBITIOUS ODD TIME LINE- AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES RAISED. BY THE- SENATOR FROM. SAN JOSE- THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO- THE KIND OF DESIGN THAT WAS BUILT I MEAN. YOU YOURSELF SAID- WE'RE GONNA AND END UP YOU KNOW ON THE FIRST FIRST PROPOSAL WAS TO AN ORCHARD AND UP IN AN ORCHARD I JUST. THINK THOSE ARE VERY- IRRESPONSIBLE SO- AGAIN IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF HOLES HERE WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUNDING AND WISHFUL THINKING. THANK THAT ALSO MISTER KELLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. WELL I WOULD JUST SAY THIS- AGAIN IT'S WHY WE ARE MOVING FORWARD IN A BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH WE LOOK AT THE REVENUES THAT WE SEE AVAILABLE TO THE PROGRAM BUT TODAY IT IS WHY WE ARE PROPOSING TO GET BEYOND THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES THAT WAS IN THE FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT AND INTO. THE CITIES OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR AN OPERATING RUN THAT MAKES SENSE THAT WOULD GIVE CALIFORNIA'S THE EXPERIENCE OF HIGH SPEED ELECTRIFIED RAIL- AND WOULD CONNECT TO IMPORTANT TRANSIT DESTINATIONS GOING ELSEWHERE THAT'S THE FIRST BUILDING BLOCK THERE'S NO QUESTION AND WE SET IT FOR MY ENTIRE TIME YEAR IN BUSINESS PLAN AFTER BUSINESS PLAN THAT. THE ON THAT SEGMENT AND BEYOND OUR BUDGET WE WILL NEED MORE BUT WE WILL NEED MORE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND OTHER PARTNERS TO COMPLETE THE SYSTEM OUTSIDE OF THE VALLEY SEGMENT. THAT IS TRUE I THINK THE BEST THINGWE CAN DO IS IMPROVE OUR PERFORMANCE ADVANCE THAT WORK IN THE VALLEY GET A USABLE SEGMENT GOING- AND THEN- AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL PARTNER- TO EXPAND THE ON- BEYOND THAT VALLEY SEGMENT- BUT I CAN ONLY DO WITH WHAT I HAVE AND- RIGHT NOW WEHAVE. A WE THINK ENOUGH TO GET A SEGMENT GOING WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. THANK YOU MISTER KELLY THANK YOU CHAIRED THE RUSSELL AREN'T OUR LAST QUESTION FOR THIS PANEL WILL BE FROM SENATOR BAKER. I IN INTERESTED TIME O'CLOCK KEEP IT SHORT- MICHELLE UNITES IS MENTION RIGHT AWAY SO I JUST WANT TO MENTION WORK THAT. CONVERSATIONS YOU AND I HAVE HAD- JUST GIVEN THE FACT THAT IN MY- DISTRICT WE'VE GOT SEVERAL HOUSING PROJECTS READY TO GO. TODAY THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED UNITS OF HOUSING AND- WE JUST REALLY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE NOT HELD UP BY. THE FUTURE HIGH SPEED RAIL PLANNING SORT PRESHOW YOUR TEAM WORKING. WITH MY OFFICE ON THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER GREAT WELL THAT ENDS OUR FINAL PANEL- WE CLEARLY HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS STILL MORE QUESTIONS TO ASK FOR FUTURE DISCUSSIONS AS WELL SO I APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS WHO'VE ASKED THOSE VERY THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED OF COURSE A LOT OF AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY BUT ALSO A LOT OF AREAS WHERE WE CAN FEEL INSPIRED. A BIT- BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL MOVING FORWARD- SO OUR NEXT PANEL WILL BE FROM- WILL BE THE FISCAL AND PROGRAM ANALYSIS OUR FIRST PANELIST IS HELEN CAST TIME PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST FOR THE L. A. O. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I THANK YOU I MISS CASTING PLEASE. BEGIN GOOD MORNING KAREN TEARS AND SENATORS MY NAME IS HELEN CHRISTINE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS MORNING'S HEARING. I WANT TO FOCUS MY BRIEF REMARKS ON A KEY DECISION THAT'S FACING THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS HOW TO APPROACH AN UPCOMING REQUEST FOR THE APPROPRIATION OF ALMOST ALL OF THE REMAINING PROPOSITION ONE A FENCE. SO THIS UPCOMING APPROPRIATION REQUEST PRESENTS A NATURAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THE PROPOSED DIRECTION OF THE PROJECT AND ENSURE THAT IT ALIGNS WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. WE KNOW THAT ANOTHER SUCH NATURAL OPPORTUNITY MAY NOT EMERGE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE TWO KEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS IT MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT THIS APPROPRIATIONS REQUEST. FIRST THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONSIDER ITS LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT AVAILABLE FUNDING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. SO I DO HEARD THE LAST. THE THIRTY X. THAT THE EXIST FUNDING BE ROUGH STIFF. TO COMPLETE THE REVISED SCOPE OF THAT WERE SENT TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. AS YOU ALSO HEARD THAT'S REALLY A SINGLE TRACK WITH PROBABLY PRETTY BASIC STATION PLATFORMS. HOWEVER HISTORICALLY PROJECT COSTS HAVE INCREASED OVER TIME FOR THIS PROJECT. THE EXPECTED FINDING WHAT MATERIALIZE FOR EXAMPLE WE HEARD ABOUT CAP AND TRADE AND HOW IN CERTAIN THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE- SO I WOULD KNOW THAT. THAT IF THAT HAPPENS AT THE EXISTING FUNDING MIGHT NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE EVEN THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. SECOND THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONSIDER ITS COMMITMENT TO FULLY FUNDING THE PROJECT THIS INCLUDES ITS LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO MEETING A FUNDING GAP IF ANY THAT COULD EMERGE IN CONSTRUCTING THE RECEPTIVE BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. AS WELL AS ITS COMMITMENT TO MEETING DEFINING FUTURE SEGMENTS SUCH AS THE BALLOT VALLEY LINE IN PHASE ONE WHICH WILL CERTAINLY REQUIRE NEW FUNDING SOURCES. IF THE LEGISLATURE IS COMMITTED TO FINDING WERE SENT TO BACKERS FIELD EVEN IF THE FUNDING GAP EMERGES. AND IS ALSO COMMITTED TO FINDING FUTURE PROJECTS SEGMENT. THAT WE THINK THAT ORTIZ APPROACH APPEARS REASONABLE AND LIKELY MAKE SENSE TO APPROPRIATE THE FUNDING THAT'S EXPECTED TO BE REQUESTED BY THE AUTHORITY. HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO FINDING MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD AND FUTURE SEGMENTS AT THIS TIME. WE SUGGESTED MAY WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER APPROACH TO MAXIMIZE THE STANDALONE VALUE OF WHATEVER INFRASTRUCTURE IS COMPLETED. AND ALSO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH FUTURE FLEXIBILITY. IN THIS CASE WE THINK THERE ARE TWO MAIN OPTIONS. FIRST THE LEGISLATURE IF THE LEGISLATURE HAD THE SPECIFIC ALTERNATIVE APPROACH THAT IT WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE FOR EXAMPLE NARROWING THE PROJECT SCOPE TO WHAT'S REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT AND THAT'S BASICALLY. BASIC TRACK IN THAT ONE NINETEEN MILES. IT COULD ADOPT STATUTORY LANGUAGE DIRECTING THE AUTHORITY ACCORDINGLY. SECOND IF THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC APPROACH THAT WOULD LIKE TO COMMIT TO AT THIS TIME- FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'D LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO DO BEFORE YOU MAKE DECISIONS- YOU CAN. ACTION TO PRESERVE YOUR FLEXIBILITY. THIS WOULD LIKELY INCLUDE DELAYING ACTION ON SOME OR ALL OF THE APPROPRIATIONS REQUEST AND THIS WOULD PRESERVE AND ASTRAL DECISION MAKING POINT FOR YOU. I WOULD ALSO LIKE NINGALOO DEDUCTING STATUTORY LANGUAGE PREVENTING THE AUTHORITY FROM ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS THAT WOULD COMMIT THE STATE TO A SPECIFIC APPROACH SUCH AS ELECTRIFICATION. SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD PREVENT THE AUTHORITY FROM PURCHASING LIKE A FIVE ROLLING STOCK AT THIS TIME OR COMMIT COMMITTING THE STATE TO CONSTRUCTING ELECTRIFY TRACK AND SYSTEMS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS CHRISTINE WE APPRECIATE THAT. UP NEXT WE HAVE LOU THOMPSON HE'S THE- CHAIR OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL HERE REVERED. REVIEW I'M SORRY GROUP MISTER THOMPSON PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOUR VERSION OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THAT I HAVE TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY I ALWAYS ENJOYED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE- HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT AS YOU MAY KNOW. THE ROLE OF THE PEER REVIEW GROUP WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN OF PROP ONE A OR A B. THREE OF TWENTY FOUR. IS TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH COMMENTS ON HIGH SPEED RAIL REPORTS AND PROPOSALS AND I HOPE THAT THESE REPORTS CAN ADD TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY. OUR LETTER COMMENTING ON THE DRAFT REVISED BUSINESS PLAN WAS SENT ON THE TWELFTH OF MARCH INFORMS THE BACKGROUND OF MY REMARKS THE DAY. LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT THERE IS SOME PROGRESS OR POSITIVE NEWS TO REPORT OF RIGHT AWAY AND THE THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS ARE COMING UNDER CONTROL. AND THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO GETTING THE EXISTING CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM UNDER BETTER CONTROL. I DO HAVE TO ADD THOUGH THAT THE EXISTING CONTRACTS HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT OVERRUNS AND BUDGET AROUND 70% ON AVERAGE. AND THE SCHEDULE DUE TO HASTE IN GETTING STARTED FUTURE CONTRACTS WILL BENEFIT FROM THE LESSONS LEARNED BUT THEY HAVE BEEN PAINFUL. THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE STATE'S STANFORD CONTRACTORS IS BEING IMPROVED IN FAVOR OF A LARGER STUDY PARTICIPATION WHICH IS A GOOD IDEA. THE STAGE GATE MANAGEMENT APPROACH WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE CONTRACTS WILL PROCEED IN THE RIGHT SEQUENCE REDUCING DELAYS AND COSTLY CHANGE ORDERS AS BRIAN MENTIONED. THE BIDEN MINISTRATION IS LIKELY TO CONSIDER REQUESTS TO RELAX DECEMBER TWENTY TWO ERA DEADLINE CAN BE RE OBLIGATE THE NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FISCAL TWO OH ONE NO. FUNDING MORE BROADLY THERE IS MORE REALISM AND WHAT THE AUTHORITY SAYS IT CAN AND CANNOT DO. THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN COMPLETE WITH THE EXISTING FUNDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER THEIR AGREEMENTS WHICH IS A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES TO DRIVE MY ONLY SECTION OF A TRACTOR. AND THEY COULD PROBABLY ADD ELECTRIFICATION TO THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SECTION PURCHASE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF IN A ROLLING STOCK. AND CONDUCT MORE DETAILED ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF ADDED LINKS TO MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD AND THE MORE DIFFICULT WORK TUNNELING OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT THE ABILITY TO COMPLETE THE PROPOSED LINKS FROM THE DEER TO MERCED AND FROM POPLAR AVENUE IN THE BAKERSFIELD IS MORE OF A CHALLENGE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. FIRST PROJECTED COST TO COMPLETE THE AUTHORITIES WORK ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL FUNDING NOW AVAILABLE. IN THIS IS BEFORE ADDING A REALISTIC ALLOWANCE FOR OVERRUNS OF WORK FOR WHICH THE ENGINEERING IS FAR FROM FULLY DETAILED. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY THAT HEADED FUNDING BEYOND EXISTING SOURCES MAY BE REQUIRED ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE PROJECT HAS NOT YET TAKEN ON ELECTRIFICATION SIGNALLING OR ROLLING STOCK PROCUREMENT. THE PROPOSAL TO OPERATE THE INTERIM SYSTEM BETWEEN MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD IS BASED ON A COMPLEX SET OF AGREEMENTS AND ACTIONS AMONG HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY THE SAN JOAQUIN JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY AND HE'S- THE CURRENT IT WILL RENEW DESCRIBES THESE AGREEMENTS BUT ACTUAL COMMITMENTS AND FUNDING TO BACK THEM UP ARE NOT. YET IN PLACE. THE TICKET WERE THE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR RELEASING THE LINE TO AN OPERATING THAT'S ALREADY THAT WOULD AGREE TO PAY FULL COSTS FOR USE OF THE LIME. AND ROLLING STOCK PURCHASE BY THE AUTHORITY. BECAUSE THE STATE SUPPORTS THE SAID WORKING JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. OPERATING THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICES THIS MEANS THAT THE STATE WILL ULTIMATELY BE ON THE HOOK. FOR WHATEVER OR IT WOULD BENEFIT FROM WHATEVER HAPPENS TODAY OPERATING DEFICIT ON THE LINE. MOREOVER THE AGREEMENT MAY BE THE SUBJECT OF LEGAL CHALLENGES UNDER THE TERMS OF PROPOSITION ONE NAY. IN ANY EVENT IS NO DOUBT THAT THE AUTHORITY WILL NEED ADDED FUNDING BEYOND EXISTING SOURCES IF IT IS TO GO BEYOND THE MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD SUCTION. WITH THIS IN MIND A REPORT EMPHASIZES SEVERAL POINTS THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. ASSUMING THE BINDING MINISTRATION APPROVES A RELAXATION OF THE ERA DEADLINE THERE WILL NO LONGER BE ANY MAJOR TIME PRESSURES THERE IS TIME TO THINK. ALTHOUGH THE AUTHORITY DOES APPEAR TO BE INCREASING ITS CONTROL OVER THE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE MORE CONFIDENT IN THE COST AND SCHEDULE PROJECTIONS IF THAT IS DEMONSTRATED OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS DIRECTED THAT A SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING CHANGES TO THE STATE TRANSPORT NETWORK BEING DEVELOPED BY JULY THE FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS REPORT SHOULD CLARIFY THE GOVERNOR'S VIEW OF THE ROLE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL AND THE OVERALL STATEMENT AND HIS IDEAS FOR FINDING IT. THIS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT BASIS FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. THIS CLEARLY IMPLIES THAT THERE WILL BE AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR THAT THE PROJECT WILL GO AHEAD EVENTUALLY IF NOT THE PROJECT SHOULD BE REASSESSED. THE EXISTING EMOJI MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING NEEDS TO BE TRANSLATED INTO A DETAILED AGREEMENT WITH FOR MANAGEMENT AND FUNDING COMMITMENTS FROM THE STATE SEN LOOKING FOR DOLLARS OR THIRTY AND ACE. THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE PROPOSED INTERIM OPERATION IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE ACTORS AND FUNDING THEIR ELDERLY THE CONTROL OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT 75% OF ALL OF THE WRITERS ON THE OVERALL OF THAT ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE AS A RESULT OF THE INTEROPERATION ARE ACTUALLY ON THE NINE I SPEED SECTION. OVERRIDING ALL OF THIS IS THE SIMPLE FACT THAT EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES MAY WELL NOT BE ADEQUATE EVEN TO FINISH THE ADDED LINKS IN THE INTERIM PROPOSAL. AND THEY WILL CERTAINLY NOT PERMIT ADDING LINKS OUTSIDE MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD. NEW FEDERAL FUNDING AND RECONSIDERATION OF ERA AND THE FISCAL TWENTY TEN MONDAY IS A POSSIBILITY THAT MAY EMERGE MORE CLEARLY IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS OR SO. AND IT IS REASONABLE TO THE FIRST OPEN STATE FUNDING DECISIONS UNTIL WE KNOW THE ANSWER. BASED ON PAST FEDERAL PROGRAM AMOUNTS AND STRUCTURE THOUGH. FEDERAL MONEY ALONE MAY WILL NOT SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM ANYWAY SO ED IN STATE FUNDING IN SOME FORM IS A CLEAR POSSIBILITY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE AWARE OF. IN ANY CASE I WANT TO STRESS A POINT WE'VE MADE BEFORE THAT MANY OF THE PAST MANAGEMENT ON THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY FUNDING ISSUES AND IT WILL NEVER BE POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE TO MANAGE THE PROJECT EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT ADEQUATE AND STABLE FUNDING. WHILE THESE ISSUES ARE BEING RESOLVED WE BELIEVE THE AUTHORITY SHOULD THE FOR MAKING NEW BINDING CONTRACT COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE DISTRICT OF CENTRAL VALLEY REQUIRED WORK. ALTHOUGH WE'VE BEEN CHANGING HEARING IN THE LINKS AND ON THE MAJOR CIVIL WORKS OUTSIDE THE CBS SHOULD OF COURSE PROCEED. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT WE BELIEVE AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE THAT IMPROVED OVERSIGHT BY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA SINCE THIS IS THE LARGEST PROJECT THE STATE HAS EVER UNDERTAKEN AND IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST THE NATION HAS EVER UNDERTAKEN. THE OVERSIGHT FUNCTION SHOULD HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING IT SHOULD HAVE THE CONTINUITY NEEDED TO OVERSEE THE PROJECT'S. PROGRESS OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS NOT JUST ONE BUDGET CYCLE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION I'LL BE HAPPY TO TRY AND ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND I WOULD ADD OF COURSE WE'RE ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU ARE WITH YOUR STAFF IN FUTURE IF THAT'S USEFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER THOMPSON WE APPRECIATE THAT- THIS WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND START WITH MEMBER QUESTIONS WE HAVE SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST LIKE TO ASK IF- IF HIS COMMENTS COULD BE TRANSLATED TO MY OFFICE IS IN WRITING THAT THOSE WHOSE WORDS I HEARD. A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY- IN THOSE COMMENTS AND I WHAT I WANNA BE ABLE TO READ THROUGH IT MORE SO THE IS NOT AVAILABLE. ASSEMBLY FOR OKAY- I WOULD APPRECIATE BEGIN MY OFFICE THE OTHER QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE OTHER COMMON I HAD IS. THE I HEARD 70% HIGHER COST AND YES WE ALL KNOW- I ACTUALLY USED TO WORK IN CONSTRUCTION AND- YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT EVERY DAY- INFLATION'S CAUSING AND- AND THINGS GO UP AND SO. I WANTED TO JUST BE. SHARE A THOUGHT ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE FUTURE GENERATIONS- MORE TWENTY TWENTY NINE ALMOST THIRTY TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT AND WE'RE GONNA SEE INFLATION- AT SOME POINT THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT WE'RE JUST PRINTING MONEY- IN THE END WE ARE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS LIKE THIS. BANK THAT IS JUST SPEWING OUT MONEY WHICH IT IS RIGHT NOW BUT- IT'S GETS ITS TO US THAT PAY THAT MONEY BACK AND WHAT WE REALLY SETTLING OUR FUTURE. BY CHILDREN WITH WE'RE SELLING THEM WITH HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEBT. SO I WOULD JUST BE CAUTIOUS TO- WHAT I HEARD IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN A LOT OF DECISIONS AT THIS LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE IN THE NEAR FUTURE ON THE FUTURE OF THESE PROJECTS SO I WOULDN'T THAT JUST TAKE THOSE COMMENTS FOR THE RECORD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY- ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBER QUESTIONS I IF NOT I HAVE ONE BUT I'LL GO HEAD TO SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS- FOR THE LACK OF BETTER WORD IT FEELS LIKE IT'S A LOVE AND HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERYONE. AND TO YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH I EXPRESSED EARLIER HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THE STATE. YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE NOTE OF WHAT WE JUST% HEARD HERE AND YOU KNOW AND WHAT- MISTER DOLLY DOES STATED AS WELL. YOU KNOW WHEN I HEARD RIGHT NOW THAT WE NEED ADEQUATE AND STABLE FUNDING IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. SO AGAIN JUST FOR THE RECORD I JUST WANTED TO STATE THAT AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT AND WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS BECAUSE CALIFORNIANS DESERVE. FAST TRAVEL CONNECTIVITY ACROSS THE STATE- I ALSO HEARD THAT WE NEED TO AVOID COMMITTING THE STATE. ARE YOU KNOW PUTTING THE STATE INTO CONTRACTS THEY'RE GONNA TILES DOWN TO FUTURE- YOU KNOW DEBT THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN SO I JUST WANTED TO. CLARIFY THAT AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE THE PROJECT. I'M I'M CONCERNED WITH WHAT I'M HEARING IN THIS PRESENTATION IN TERMS OF THE STABILITY OF THE FUNDING AND SO WE NEED TO REALLY JUST LOOK CLOSELY INTO THE PROJECT THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO AND ON THAT- I DID HAVE A QUESTION AS TO THE- FUTURE FLEXIBILITY WHICH INCLUDES THE BINDING CONTRACTS AND YOU KNOW ALL OF THAT BUT ARE THERE IS THERE ANY MORE THAT YOU CAN ELABORATE ON EITHER MISTER. THOMPSON ARE MAYES- CHRISTINE ON WHAT OTHER FUTURE FLEXIBILITY OPPORTUNITIES A LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE OR ANY OTHER EXAMPLES. OF BINDING CONTRACTS THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. I CAN TAKE A STAB AT THAT- IF THAT'S HELPFUL SO. I IN IT IT SAID IN A CONTRACT THAT YOU MENTIONED THERE IS A TRACKING SYSTEMS CNTRACT THAT'S COMING UP WHICH IS A VERY LARGE CONTRACT AND WOULD ESSENTIALLY COMMIT THE STATE TO ELECTRIFICATION. ON AT LEAST THAT ONE NINETEEN AT THAT INITIAL ONE EIGHTEEN SEGMENT- THERE'S ALSO THAT AND ROLLINGSTOCK CONTRACT WHICH IS ANOTHER VRY LARGE HUNDRED THAT'S COMING UP IN ADDITION TO THAT. UNDER SOME OTHER ACTIONS THAT THE AUTHORITY MAY TAKE ON FOR EXAMPLE. YOU MAY START- YOU KNOW IT AT SOME POINT PURCHASING RIGHT OF WAY THOSE TYPES OF ACTIONS WITH WOULD START- OUTSIDE OF THAT ONE NINETEEN RIGHT NOW IT'S BEEN BASED BASICALLY FOCUSED ON THAT ONE NINETEEN MILES. THOSE TYPES OF ACTIONS ALSO START TO KIND OF LIMIT THAT THE FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE OTHER. APPROACHES IN THE FUTURE- IN TERMS OF EITHER APPROACH IS I THINK WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF REFERENCES TO THAT ELECTRIFICATION VERSES NOT. ONE OF. THEM I THINK MAYBE FOR THAT AND- JUST AS A LITTLE BIT OF. I THINK THE MAIN KIND OF. THING THAT FOLKS ARE OF ARE. FOCUSED ON IS THIS ONE NINETEEN MILES AND YOU ELECTRIFY OR NOT IF YOU. JOINT IF YOU DON'T ELECTRIFY THAT THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT THEN OF COURSE YOU WANT TO COME BACK ELECTRIFY LATER. THAT YEAR THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL COST TO DOING THAT BUT IF YOU DO ELECTRIFY THAT PIECE IT JUST RUN ON ELECTRIFIED SERVICE ON ONE NINETEEN MILES THAT YOU FROM SHAFTER TO MADERA AS YOU SAW. AND THOSE ARE REALLY LOGICAL STARTING AND ENDING POINTS AND YOU KNOW YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T WANT TO TAKE A CONVENTIONAL TRAINS TRANSFERRED TRANSFERRED BACK. AND IT PROBABLY ISN'T SERVICE THAT REALLY MAKES SENSE SO IF YOU'RE GONNA LECTURE BY YOU PROBABLY NEED TO ELECTRIFY A LARGER SEGMENT AT LEAST MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SO ONCE YOU START COMMITTING TO ELECTRIFICATION. YOU HAVEN'T REALLY PROBABLY JUST COMMITTED TO ELECTRIFICATION THAT ONE NINETEEN HOW DO YOU PRACTICE YOU COULD COMMITTED. TO AT LEAST DOING MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD OTHERWISE YOU HAVE A SEGMENT THAT REALLY JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THIS ONE NINETEEN MILES. SO I DON'T HAVE IT RIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT FOR THAT DECISION BUT IT REALLY IS A CRITICAL DECISION. AND ONCE THOSE YOU KNOW THOSE CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO. THE STATE COMMITS ITSELF TO A TRADITION OF THE ONE NINETEEN AND CAN PRACTICE WERE PROBABLY COMMITTING OURSELVES TO. ELECTRIFICATION AND REALLY RUNNING THAT MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD THAT MAY REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL FINES. AND THEN IDEALLY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE EXPANDED BEYOND THAT BECAUSE EVEN MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD. IT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT THE DREAM OF EVERYONE HERE I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAINLY VISION FOR BEYOND THAT. BUT THAT OF COURSE WOULD COME WITH ADDITIONAL COSTS. I DON'T KNOW MISTER THOMPSON YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD AS WELL. IF I MAY. I THINK WE SHOULD THAT IS ONE WAY. ONE TO WHICH- APPROACH THIS. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE WHICH IS. LOOK AT IT FROM THE- QUESTION OF WHETHER WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BUILD THE SYSTEM OR NOT. IF THERE IS A COMMITMENT TO BUILD THE SYSTEM AND THIS IS A STEP ALONG THE WAY. THEN THEM IT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE TAKE OUR TIME AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE DO IT A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME UNTIL WE FACT THERE IS NO COMMITMENT TO BUILD THE SYSTEM THEN WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT- WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT AND HOW FAR WE GO. WE ARE COMMITTED- TO FAIRNESS BY THAT TO FURNISH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR COMMITMENT THE HUNDRED NINETY MILE SECTION THAT WE- IN PRINCIPLE WE HAVE TO DO THAT. UP BEYOND THAT- ANYTHING LEGISLATURE REALLY NEEDS TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF ARE WE GOING TO DO THE SYSTEM EVENTUALLY YES OR NO AND IF WE ARE AND IF WE CAN AGREE WITH YOU THE LEGISLATURE CAN AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT THEN GOVERNOR. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THEN THEN THE TIME THAT IS AVAILABLE TO FIGURE OUT FIRST WHAT WILL BE THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SECOND YOU KNOW HOW WILL WE SEE FOR THIS PROJECT OVER TIME. BUT I THINK IT ALL FITS WITHIN THE QUESTION OF ARE WE COMMITTED TO BUILD THE SYSTEM UNDER PROP ONE EIGHTY. WE ARE COMMITTED TO BUILD THE SYSTEM BUT THE LEGISLATURE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO PASS ON THAT. NEITHER DID THE GOVERNOR. SO PROP ONE A. COULD AS A POSITION TO SOMETHING WHICH WAS NOT ADEQUATELY FUNDED AND IT DID NOT HAVE THE COMMITMENT EITHER OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE LEGISLATURE. BUT NEEDS TO CHANGE. IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE SHORT TERM DECISIONS IN THE RIGHT KIND OF CONTACTS. THANK YOU MISTER THOMPSON I APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS FOR FROM- BOTH YOU MISTER MISS ACT CHRISTINE. OUR NEXT WE HAVE CHAIRED THAT ALSO AND THEN WILL HAVE A SENATOR WITH KELSEY FINISHED OFF. THANK YOU MANAGER- BECAUSE THIS IS FOR BOTH THE L. A. O. L. AND MR THOMPSON- IS. I'D LIKE TO SEE BECAUSE I'VE HEARD PIECES OF. YES FUNDING WE HAVE SOME FUNDING WELL WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT THE OTHER FUNDING WHAT ABOUT THE FEDERAL OF FUNDING ALL OF THAT IS JUST SO UNCERTAIN. IT SEEMS TO ME WE ARE TO BE PROVIDED WITH. OPTIONS OF THAT AREN'T ALL OR NOTHING WITH THIS PROJECT OR AT LEAST. IF THESE ARE BUILDING BLOCKS THEN WE OUGHT TO KNOW MUCH MORE CLEARLY THE TIME LINE IS IT REALISTIC. LIKE LIAM BUT THE COST IS THE COST- ESTIMATE FOR BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED IS THAT REALISTIC IS A TIMELINE. OF FOR THE COMPLETION TO INCLUDE ALL THE WAY TO LA IS THAT REALISTIC I MEAN. WE'RE ETTING PIECES HERE THAT DON'T SEEM TO. A BE REALISTIC- AND ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO THE FUNDING SO I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET. THESE OPTIONS ALL THE WAY THROUGH. I THINK WE ALL WANT. I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY SAY WE DON'T WANT IT ALL TOGETHER AT ALL. A STATE WIDE BUT THERE'S SO MANY PROBLEMS THAT HAVE COME UP THAT WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS THOSE IN A MORE REALISTIC WAY. SO I'M LOOKING FOR OPTIONS- AND WITH THE FULL EXTENT OF FUNDING AND TIMELINE THAT A REALISTIC. THANK YOU CHAIRED RUSSELL AND IS THAT SOMETHING- THE- MISS CHRISTINE THAT WOULD YOU WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER AND IS IT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BE PROVIDED MAYBE PERHAPS AFTER THE MEETING AS WELL. UNLESS YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN AND ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. AND I'M HAPPY THREE WORK CERTAINLY WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF- SENATORS HAVE PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND- AND HELP YOU. AND GET WHATEVER INFORMATION BE HELPFUL AS YOU AS YOU CONSIDER THOSE THINGS I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF THE COST ESTIMATES PARTICULARLY WITH THOSE MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD EXTENSION. BEFORE THOSE ARE AN EARLY DESIGNS. AGES AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MUCH IS GOING TO COST A WHILE BACK OR HE'S BECOME MUCH MORE CERTAIN ABOUT THAT ONE NINETEEN AND EVEN THERE THERE'S YOU KNOW A BILLION DOLLARS OF EXTRA CONTINGENCY RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY EVEN WITH THAT ONE NINETEEN BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THE MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD EXTENSION AND- DEFINITELY BEYOND THAT SO. YOU KNOW THEY HAD THERE IS THAT SORT OF ESTIMATE OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COSTS THAT YOU EIGHTY PLUS BILLION BUT THAT IS SUBJECT TO VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN ONLY REALLY PRELIMINARY WORK- FOR A LOT OF PHASE ONE. I TELL ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT CERTAINLY THE TIMING THAT THAT DIED TWENTY THIRTY THREE DAY BATTLE THAT IT SEEMS FULL FUNDING WHICH IS NOT WHICH AS WE'VE HEARD AND IN THIS PANEL SO FAR AND IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL DOESN'T EXIST AND SO EVEN IF THEY HAD THAT THAT THE FORTIES ESTIMATE IF THEY HAVE ALL THE MONEY IN HAND TODAY READY TO GO. EVEN THAT MIGHT BE AMBITIOUS AND BY CERTAINLY WITHOUT YOU KNOW WITHOUT FULL FUNDING WHICH IS THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION NOW AND THAT'S UNLIKELY THAT TO COME TO PASS SO I'M DEFINITELY AGREE WITH WHAT YOU AND INDICATED THEY'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU HAD TO THINK ABOUT OPTIONS- IF THAT'S HELPFUL. THANK YOU MISS CHRISTINE AND YES I THINK WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS THE SCENARIO PLAN I KNOW THAT SEEMS EASY ENOUGH BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT POTENTIALS. THAT COULD BE- THE- DURING THIS PROCESS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A THING VISUAL. SO THAT OBJECT. AND MISTER KELLY WILL HAVE A YEAH NO I JUST WANT TO A AS HE QUESTIONS I WILL ARE A IN THE BUSINESS PLANS TO BOTH YOU KNOW LAY OUT WHAT WE HAVE WHAT THE VISION IS A BE ON THIS PROGRAM TO GET ALTERNATELY TO THE PHASE ONE SYSTEM THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED AND THAT'S HOW WE REPRESENT THE STOP THE BUSINESS PLAN IT IS FAIR AND A GOOD QUESTION AND A GOOD POINT. FOR BOTH L. A. O. AND THE PEER REVIEW GROUP SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE ARE RISKS I HAD ALONG THE WAY ON THIS AND I JUST WANT TO. VOLUNTEER MY TEAM AND MY STAFF TO TALK ABOUT IT BE PART OF THIS DISCUSSION. ON BUT HOW WE INCREMENTALLY GO FORWARD IN THE TIMING. BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS TO PEEL APART. IF YOU DON'T DO CERTAIN THINGS IT MEANS SOME COSTS ARE SIMPLY DEFERRED IF YOU DO CERTAIN THINGS. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN COVER THAT AND- HAVE A GREATER LEVEL OF COMFORT ON THE ESTIMATES FOR THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE I WANT ONE TO. NOT MOVE FORWARD ON ADVANCED DESIGN WORK THAT WOULD ANSWER A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT COST AND OTHER THINGS. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THE ONE NINETEEN YEAH WE SHOULD DO THOSE CONCURRENTLY. SO I THINK THERE ARE I THINK WHAT I'M ASKING IS. THAT THE AUTHORITY BE A PARTICIPANT WITH L. PRG LEGISLATIVE OFFICES ABOUT LEADING OUT WITH THOSE INCREMENTAL STEPS COULD LOOK LIKE AND I WOULD. APPRECIATE THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT'S ALL THANK YOU MISTER KELLY AND- I'M- MADE. I THINK ALREADY HAS IF YOU CAN BE BRIEF IN WE HAVE ONE- AND WILL ONE THING IS LIVE WITH OF IN THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE MADE TO THE LEGISLATURE IN WHICH I THINK BRIAN MOSTLY. KERR'S THERE. THERE ARE STILL MORE UNCERTAINTY IS OF THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS OR SO THAT WILL MAKE IT. CLEAR WHAT YOU MIGHT WISH TO DO. ONE IS THE FEDERAL ROLE I HOPE IT WILL BE CLEARER YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF WORK THEY WILL BE. THE SECOND IS BRIAN PROPOSES IS TO DO A LOT MORE ENGINEERING WORK AND BETTER COST ESTIMATES OF THOSE LINKS AND ON THE TUNNEL SOLD HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF. HOW REALISTIC IT IS THAT THEY CAN LOOK UP WHAT THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH. WITH NEW EXISTING MONEY. OF THE THIRTY. IS GOVERNOR REPORT IN OF JUNE. WHICH COMES AND GOES. THE STATE'S DECISION. WILL BE MUCH CLEARER IN. IS THE LEGISLATURE REQUEST THE GOVERNOR'S VIEW ON HELD ADDITIONAL FUNDING MIGHT BE PROVIDED. IN THE FINAL EIGHT POINTS IS THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THE KEY OPERATING AGREEMENT FOR THE INTERIM SYSTEM WHICH SHALL. IS A MEMORANDUM BY A NUMBER OF THOSE ISSUES COULD BE MUCH FURTHER CLARIFIED SO THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE. MORE CONFIDENCE IN WHAT IS OPTIONS. REALLY ARE AND WHAT IT WANTS TO DO. THANK VERY MUCH MR TA. SYNNEX ARE GONNA GO TO OUR LAST QUESTION FOR THIS PANEL SENATOR MCCARTHY. GARCIA I GUESS THE KEY QUESTION FOR THE DECISION MAKERS HERE IS WHAT WE DO WITH THE REQUEST FOR FULL FUNDING ON THE ONE A- AND I. REALLY SAYS IT FOR ALL IN THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD THAN OBVIOUSLY APPROVAL ALL THE FUNDING AND KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL- I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE AND IF THE LEGISLATURE IS WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT RISK AND- ACCEPT THE OPPORTUNITY. THE INVITATION THAT THEY MAY HAVE TO COME UP WITH MORE FUNDING. IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES WE'VE TALKED TO- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT. IS THERE A NUMBER THAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT AS WE WAIT FOR OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE AMBITIOUS OR AS IS THE MISTER KELLY'S AT STATED THERE'S SOME ENVIRONMENTAL WORK AND SOME OTHER NON CONSTRUCTION WORK THAT IS VERY VALUABLE FOR US TO DETERMINE COSTS SO- I GET THE EASY ANSWER FOR ALL LAND FUNDED ALL I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT SHE'D AGREE FOR THE LA- IF THEY CAN. HELP US WITH. WE DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE STABILITY OF EXPECTATIONS WE DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE- RELATIONSHIP A POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE DISCUSS THIS AMONG OURSELVES AND IF WE PLAY WITH THE NUMBERS. I THINK PERHAPS ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT THE THIRTY NOT GONNA NEED THAT THE ENTIRE FOUR POINT ONE BILLION IN. THAT YEAR- AND I THINK IN FACT THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF THAT THEY WILL NEED- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THEIR THEIR- PAST HISTORY OF NOT REALLY SPENDING UP THERE PROJECTED. LEVELS AND SO. FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD APPROVE YOU KNOW PORTION OF THAT WHATEVER- IS A TERM HE BEING NEEDED YOU KNOW IF ANY TO SORT OF GET THE AUTHORITY THROUGH THE FISCAL YEAR. AND THEN. COULD HOLD OFF ON THE DECISION ABOUT THE REMAINING FRIENDS THAT WERE AT YOU KNOW AS WE SAID WE PROVIDE ANOTHER NATURAL OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGISLATURE COME BACK NEXT YEAR- I THINK ONE THING TO DO YOU TO CONSIDER THEIR TO YOU THOUGH IS WHETHER IT'S- THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO PROVIDE DIRECTION TO THE AUTHORITIES SPECIFICALLY NOT. GOING TO ENTER INTO ANY THIS CONTRACT THAT WOULD BIND THE LEGISLATURE I'M REALLY TO A SPECIFIC APPROACH BECAUSE ESPECIALLY LIKE WE KNOW THAT THEIR TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT IS COMING UP. THE ROLLING STOCK PROCUREMENT IS COMING UP IF THEY PROCEED WITH THOSE COMMITMENTS SPAN AND THEN REALISTICALLY PROBABLY THE PROJECT ASSISTANT ON OF HAVE TO GO IN ONE DIRECTION WHICH IS NOW. AFTER FIVE YEARS AT THE BAKERSFIELD. SO I THINK KNOW WOULD HAVE TO DO ALL ALL OR NOTHING THE FOR FREE YOU COULD. YEP CERTAIN. AND YOU COULD YOU COULD DESIGNATE THOSE FUNDS TO YOU COULD HAVE OR YOU COULD SAY YOU KNOW WE WANT TO PORTION OF THEM TO GO TO CERTAIN ACTIVITIES IF YOU. REALLY VALUE THAT ADVANCED DESIGN WORK YOU COULD. YOU COULD TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS PRIORITIZE IN IN WHATEVER YOU FIND. SO YEAH I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY SOME OPTIONS DEPENDING ON THE PRIORITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS COMFORT LEVEL AGAIN WITH. WITH WHETHER IT WANTS TO COMMIT TO OUR CENTURY HERSELF AND REALLY ALL OF PHASE ONE- OR AT LEAST OUT OF THE VALLEY AND COULD EVEN MERCED TO BAKER STILL THIS PROBLEM ESPECIALLY AS CURRENTLY ENVISIONED A SINGLE TRACK OR SAID TO BAKERSFIELD WITH VERY BASIC STATIONS. IT IS IT'S PROBABLY NOT FOLKS IS A SORT OF END GAME HERE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S EVEN YOU KNOW THE AUTHORITIES ENGAGEMENTS AS THEY'VE INDICATED THEY THINK VIEW THIS AS A STEPPING. BLOCK APPROACH- WE MAY BARELY GET ENOUGH TO DO THAT. POTENTIALLY BUT EVEN THAT WOULDN'T. BE WHAT WOULD REALLY WANT RESET THE BAKERSFIELD AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM SO. I THINK IT'S OUR TIMES WITH ACTUALLY CRACKED. WE NEE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THAT COMMITMENT- AND IF TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN DELAY THAT DECISION TO GET MORE INFORMATION THAT'S WONDERFUL. AND I THINK THAT WE PROBABLY CAN'T BE A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY NOW DESPITE NAY MINISTRATION. YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME MORE TIME TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS- AND- PRESERVE SOME OF THAT FLEXIBILITY SO I THINK THAT WAS ALSO AN EXCELLENT POINT. THANK YOU MISS CHRISTINE. THANK YOU SENATOR AKOWSKI OKAY THAT. COMPLETES OUR SECOND PANEL WE APPRECIATE. THOSE COMMENTS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT OPTIONS AS WELL- WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR LAST AND FINAL PANEL ON THIS IS MADE UP OF A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PARTNERS. FIRST WE WILL HEAR FROM STACEY MORTENSEN FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN REGIONAL RAIL COMMISSION. THE OPERATORS OF THE SAN JOAQUIN AMTRAK SERVICE IN THE EAST TRAIN SERVICE. SECOND WILL BEAT JIM HARTNETT FROM CALTRAIN IN THE BAY AREA AND FINALLY WE WILL HEAR FROM OUR FRIENDS AT DELHI METRO WELCOME ALL AND LET'S START WITH MS MORTENSEN. THANK YOU BOTH ESTEEM CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I CAN APPRECIATE THE MENTAL GYMNASTICS YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO. KEEP THIS ALL IN PERSPECTIVE- THROUGHOUT THIS LAST DIFFICULT YEAR OUR VALLEY RAIL PROGRAM HAS BEEN MOVING ALONG AND IT'S IN KEEPING HER SPIRITS HIGH AS WE EMBARK ON. NEW IMPROVEMENTS AND RAIL CONNECTIONS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. FOR ORIENTATION VALLEY RAIL OR THE GREEN AND PURPLE LINES YOU SEE SORT OF IN THE CENTRAL PART OF CALIFORNIA THERE. THOSE LINES COME OUT OF MERCED WHICH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AND THE BRANCH OFF INTO OAKLAND SAN JOSE AND THEN THEN A THOMAS AREA NEAR THE SACRAMENTO AIRPORT. WE'RE ALSO IN CHARGE OF THE THRUWAY BUS PROGRAM FOR CALIFORNIA. WHICH YOU SEE IN THOSE DASHED GREEN LINES THAT GO TO THE FAR REACHES OF THE STATE. AND ALSO ALLOW US TO CONNECT WITH OUR PARTNERS THE PACIFIC SURFLINER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY AS A PASSENGER OUR NETWORK CONNECTS PEOPLE TO MANY DIFFERENT SERVICES TO CALTRAIN VTA BART CAPITOL CORRIDOR THE FUTURE VALLEY LINK SERVICE- AND THE SACRAMENTO AIRPORT. AND THE SEMI CANCEL THEY CURRENTLY OPERATE OUT OF BAKERSFIELD BOTH ACE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN WILL OPERATE IN THE FUTURE OUT OF MERCED. AS THEY MEET THE TERMINUS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM. IN A RECENT BIG BIG BILLS TO OUR PROGRAM IS CALLED THE STOCKTON DIAMOND GRADE SEPARATION I'LL JUST SORT OF PUT YOU TO WHERE IT IS ON THE MAP WHERE ALL OF THE GREEN AND PURPLE CONVERGE THERE. IN STOCKTON. WE HAVE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO COLTON CROSSING DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BIG BIG BOTTLENECK- TERRIBLE PROBLEM FOR FREE CONGESTION. UNITY OF OBSTRUCTIONS AT CETERA WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE PLAN VIEW THAT YOU SEE HERE YOU KNOW SEEMINGLY IT LOOKS LIKE NO MAN'S LAND- IT REALLY IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT THE CITY OF STOCKTON HAS BEEN FACING. THIS GIVES YOU UP THE SCENARIO OF UNION PACIFIC IN THE MIDDLE THERE GOING UP AND OVER THE BURLINGTON NORTHERN SANTA FE AND WELL IN THIS VIEW FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE YOU CAN SEE HOW. NOT ONLY WAS A CHOKING OUT ALL TRAINS RUNNING AT THAT CROSSING IT CERTAINLY WILL BE BLOCKING THE WHOLE CITY OF STOCKTON DOWNTOWN INTERSECTIONS AND INTERSECTS WITH THAT THE MAJOR TWO MAJOR HIGHWAYS SO. THIS PROJECT FOR US IS VERY EXCITING WE GOT A FEDERAL BILL GRANT RECENTLY ONE OF THE ONLY RAIL GRANTS LIKE THAT IN THE COUNTRY. AND THEN IT IT BOOSTED AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING SO THIS PROJECT IS REALLY BUILDING SOME MOMENTUM AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUPPORT. AND EVEN STATEWIDE. I HE LIVES. HM SAN JOAQUIN SPOKE OPERATES ON THE FREIGHT LINES THE CORPORATION OF BURLINGTON NORTHERN SANTA FE AND UNION PACIFIC ARE CRITICAL AND OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES WE DEVELOP GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM SO THAT NOW WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE WE'RE GETTING READY TO UNDERTAKE THIS VERY MASSIVE EXPANSION PROGRAM FOR US THEY'VE WORKED WITH US ON A SERIES OF PHASED IMPROVEMENTS TO LET US START SERVICE WHICH IS CAN BE UNUSUAL A LOT OF TIMES THE FREIGHT RAILROADS ONE ALL OF THE IMPROVEMENTS UP FRONT BEFORE ANY SERVICE CAN START. AND SO I THINK EVEN AS HIGH SPEED RAIL IS LOOKING AT A PHASED APPROACH WE'RE THANKFUL WE CAN LOOK AT A PHASED APPROACH AND GET SOME SERVICE TO THE PASSENGERS SOONER SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT FOUR WAVES OF SERVICE ALL OF THEM HAPPENING AND REALLY IN THE TIME FRAME OF. TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND THEN EACH SECTION THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT GENERALLY INCLUDES NEW DOUBLE TRACK SECTIONS SIGHTINGS WHERE THEIR SINGLE TRACK BRIDGE WHITE NING'S ALONG WITH STATIONS AND LAYOVER FACILITIES I'M GONNA START WITH WAIT TILL ONLY BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO START IN THE NORTH REALLY WAVES ONE AND TWO AND I'LL TALK. ABOUT ARE GOING TO GO SIMULTANEOUSLY. BUT THIS ROUTE IS FOR FROM SAP. DOWN TO STOCKTON. THE PURPLE AND GREEN LINE THAT YOU SEE WITH THE OTHERS KIND OF MAGENTA AND GREEN THAT IS GOING TO BE THE NEW. RAIL ROUTE OF THE FUTURE THIS IS A ROUTE THAT'LL ALLOW US TO ADD MANY MORE TRAIN FREQUENCIES. THIS IS A UNION PACIFIC SEGMENT THEY'VE OFFERED THAT WE COULD NEGOTIATE WITH THEM TO GO UP TO A HUNDRED AND TEN. MILES AN HOUR BUT GIVEN THE SPACING PROBABLY NINETY TO NINETY FIVE IS MORE LIKELY BUT THAT'S FASTER THAN WE RUN TODAY. AND THEN THESE- THIS ALIGNMENT GIVES US. BETTER SERVICE TO THE SACRAMENTO AIRPORT WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE ON THE FORMER LINE AND IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO WORK WITH YOU COUNTY FOR POTENTIAL EXPANSIONS UP TO. A YUBA CITY AND MERRY'S VEIL WHICH THE CURRENT LINE DOES NOT DO SO FROM A FUTURE STANDPOINT. THIS RAIL LINE WELL LET'S NOT USE NOW WILL OPEN UP SERVICE T A LOT MORE PARTS OF THE STATE. AND MORE CONNECTIONS TO BE MADE. OUR WAY TO THE STATE IN YELLOW YOU SEE THE ACE. EXISTING SERVICE. AT THE LATER OF AREA WE BRANCH OFTEN GO SOUTH SO OUR WAVE ONE OF CONSTRUCTION IS THE DOTTED GREEN LINE THAT TAKES US DOWN TO SERIES. THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILE EXTENSION. AND THEN OUR OUR WAGE THREE IS THE PURPLE SECTION FROM SERIES DOWN THE MERCED YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT'S LONGER IT'S GOT RIVER CROSSINGS- SO THAT IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A BIGGER LEFT. BUT IT GETS US TO OUR INITIAL SERVICE TO MERCED. AND THE PRIMARY STATIONS. OUR PHASE FOR WHICH WILL BE AFTER TWENTY TWENTY SIX. WILL BUILD IN ALL OF THE PLANNED STATIONS WHICH IS FOURTEEN. AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO HAVE SIX TRAINS DOWN SOMERSET. YOU SEE THE LITTLE INTERSECTION DOWN THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE MERCED LOOKS VERY SIMPLE- BUT OF COURSE IT ISN'T AS YOU HEARD. EARLIER A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS WHEN YOU BUILD REYES. WHEN- THE B. WHICH IS OUR SAME MUCH RUN. AND THE U. P. WHICH IS OUR ACE RUN WHEN THOSE TWO LINE COME DOWN TOMORROW. THEY ARE NOT AT THE SAME LOCATION SO YOU SEE ON THE SITE HERE IT'S CALLED OUT WHERE THE MERCED STATION WILL BE FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL ON THE U. P. LINE. THERE IS A GAP FROM THE BNSF. WHERE WE NEED TO CLOSE THE GAP FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN SENATE'S ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FEET SO THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF OUR BIG LAUGHS RIGHT HERE. HOW TO FIGURE OUT MAKING THIS CONNECTION THAT'S A LITTLE TOO SOON TO GIVE A FINAL COST ESTIMATE AND FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW HOW WELL FUNDED WE ARE AND WHAT OUR GAP IS. BECAUSE WE NEED TO KNOW IF HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL COME IN A GRADE. ELEVATED IN A TRANSIENT SO AS- AS BRIAN WAS TALKING ABOUT DOING THIS ADDITIONAL WORK TO GET TO THE END POINTS. THAT HELPS US A LOT FIGURE OUT WHAT OUR FINAL PHASE OF THE PROJECT WILL BE. TO MAKE THIS REALLY IMPORTANT CONNECTION. SO BACK JUST IN SUMMARY WE HAVE- A ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN HAND TO DATE. AND WE ESTIMATE WE NEED ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT BUT LIKE I SAID WE'RE WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THAT NUMBER SO THAT IS A LOT TO JUST GET ROLLING WITH. WE DO HAVE SIX NEW LOCOMOTIVES AND TWENTY ONE RAIL CARS ON ORDER SO WE'RE READY FOR THAT EXPANSIONIN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE STOCK INDICTMENT WHICH REALLY IS THAT I LOVE THIS PROJECT I LIKE TO BUILD THINGS AND SO THIS ONE'S GOING TO BE TERRIFIC. THE NEED WILL BE CONCLUDED THIS FALL IN THE FINAL ENGINEERING WILL START. EARLY NEXT YEAR AND THEN OUR CONSTRUCTION WAVES ONE AND TWO WILL BE BEGINNING AND- EARLY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO. THE LADY THAT LIKES TO BUILD STUFF A LOT OF THINGS WILL BE IN ACTION. A LITTLE LESS THAN A YEAR FROM NOW SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT ALL THAT'S GOING ON N OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT OUR PROGRAM OR THE COORDINATED WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH BRIAN AND HIS FOLKS AT HIGH SPEED RAIL AND THINK I THINK. THANK YOU MISS MARTIN SAID WE APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M NEXT UP WE HAVE JIM HARTNETT MISTER HEARTED FROM CALTRAIN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SUPPLY HER TO APPEAR BEFORE. A JOINT COMMITTEE AGAIN HI IN OUR REGULAR REPORT. ALL RIGHT IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS- AS YOU KNOW I REPRESENT CALTRAIN LINE WHICH RUNS FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN JOSE- ON AB RIGHT AWAY THAT WE OWN. HI AND WE ALSO OPERATE ON U. P. LINE FROM SAN JOSE TO GILROY. FROM OUR LINE IS A VERY OLD BY. IT STARTED OUT WHEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS ON OFFICES- IN. BEING OUT OF AN OLD BLIND IT COME WITH A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES BUT WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT IT IS I RUN THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC REGIONS. IN THE WORLD. AND ITS IMPORTANCE HAS ONLY INCREASED OVER TIME WE PURCHASED THE LINE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN JOSE. AND ON THAT LINE- WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING AN OLD DIESEL FLEET. ANOTHER OLD DIESEL LEADERS SERVICE WELL BECAUSE WE HAVE OVERTIME BILL ABOUT OUR SERVICE UP TO BE IN THE SEVENTH LARGEST COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE IN THE COUNTRY. AND ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENTLY RUN.

SPANNING OVER A DECADE IN MAKING STRATEGIC COME CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. TOTALLING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ROSECRANS MARQUARDT GREAT SEPARATION PROJECT AND THE LINKING A STATION PROJECT. THESE TWO PROJECTS ENHANCE BOTH.

AND THE SUMMER OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AND COUPLED WITH A GROWING POPULATION AND ALL IT IN ALREADY DENSELY POPULATED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION OF TWENTY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE MORE THAN 50% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. MORE CRITICAL REGIONAL RAIL TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TODAY. ONE SUCH EXAMPLE IS THE HIGH DESERT QUARTER INTERCITY HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT THAT WILL CONNECT LAS VEGAS TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE CITY OF PALMDALE VIA BRIGHTLINE LAST. WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR NEW FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING IN HIGH SPEED RAIL. ONLY MEASURE SUPPORTS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TWENTY TWENTY DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN WITH THE ADDITION OF MORE REGIONAL RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SUCH AS THE RANKING INSTITUTION BASED BE. HI DESERT QUARTER PROJECT AND THE MEASURING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPTIMIZE RAIL EXPANSION PROGRAM.

MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS OWNS WE APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU OKAY SO WHAT I'LL DO NOW IS WE'RE GONNA GO TO MEMBER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE HAVE SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I KNOW THAT- I'VE BEEN VERY CRITICAL BUT THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD SPEND OUR MONEY LOCAL. READ REGION'S WITH TRANSFERRED THAT TO A TRANSPORTATION RAIL IS WHERE WE CAN GET THE BEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK THIS IS WHERE I THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD REALLY. DO A GREAT JOB IN. THOSE HIGH POPULATED AREAS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE PEOPLE AND I THINK THE IMPACT TO. THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE BETTER WE CAN REDIRECT THOSE JOBS FROM. FROM THE VALLEY TO THOSE PROJECTS AND KEEP OUR OUR- TRADES FOLKS WORK AND THAT'S WHERE WE DO THAT I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE SHOULD GO IS FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO GO FOR THOSE REGIONAL TRANSIT- DOLLARS BECAUSE WE IT REALLY MAKES AN IMPACT WE CAN MOVE PEOPLE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND HELP THE ENVIRONMENT OVER THE LONG HAUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR CORTESE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- OF IF IT'S- IF IT'S NOT A TIMELY I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK UNDERSTAND THAT THE PANELISTS ARE ALL HERE STILL AVAILABLE TO US IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU AND NOTHING WAS MISS- MISS KIRSTEN- WAS. TALKING ABOUT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FUNDING DECISIONS HERE IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN WHAT MAY BE COMING OUT OF THE CONGRESS IN THE BINDER MINISTRATION ULTIMATELY. I WANTED TO GO BACK TO THAT THREAT BECAUSE IT'S ONE THAT IT WAS REFERENCED BY NEARLY ALL OF THE PRESENTERS. SO FAR- IN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT- IT WOULD BE. EXTREMELY PRUDENT FOR US- CERTAINLY SOMETHING OF TALK TO OUR A SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE CHAIR SENATOR ALSO ABOUT IN THE PAST- TO DOVE TAIL. OUR EFFORTS AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE WITH THE ANTICIPATED. ACTIONS WHETHER SUCCESSFUL OR NOT A COMING OUT OF THE CONGRESS IN THE BITING MINISTRATION IN IT AND I'M WONDERING IF. IT'S A LITTLE SORT OF A TWO PART QUESTION IF ENOUGH HOMEWORK HAS BEEN DONE WITH- ARE- ARE FEDERAL. ADVOCATES THOSE THAT REPRESENTS IN CALIFORNIA WASHINGTON COULD TO DETERMINE AT LEAST THE RANGE OF TIME- NGUYEN. THAT DECISION OR THOSE DECISIONS ON TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION- POSSIBLE INCREASES THE FEDERAL TRUST FUND WINDOWS WOULD LIKELY COME TO A VOTE. IN THE CONGRESS HERE AND- IF THAT HOMEWORK HAS BEEN DONE IF WE HAVE THAT IDEA I'D LIKE TO HEAR THAT ANSWER NOW IF NOT I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE WE GET THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN. IT LEAST. CONSIDER THE ARGUMENT THAT. APPROPRIATION DECISIONS HERE TO GO BEYOND WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROPRIATED IF INDEED THOSE ARE ON THE TABLE- ARE ARE NOT MADE IN ADVANCE OF KNOWING OF WHAT FEDERAL CONTRIBUTIONS MIGHT BE AVAILABLE IN THIS FISCAL YEAR. THE OKAY AND SENATOR CORTESE THINK THAT WAS DIRECTED TO MS CHRISTINE. YES I THOUGHT THAT SHE- SHE HAS SOME THOUGHTS ON THE SUBJECT AND IF SHE FEELS SOMEBODY ELSE IS BETTER EQUIPPED TO ANSWER THAT'S FINE AS LONG ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. HI HI HI HI CHRISTINE SO I DON'T. I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL EXACTLY WHAT THE TIMING IS I UNDERSTAND THAT- CERTAINLY THERE BEEN RUMBLINGS ABOUT A POTENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE FELL ON THAT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND WE NEED TO GET SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT IN THE COMING MONTHS. I'M CERTAINLY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT WOULD BE- PERHAPS BE BEFORE NEXT YEAR- BEFORE HERE NEXT YEAR BUT EXACTLY WHAT THE TIMING WOULD BE- I'M NOT CERTAIN AND MAYBE THAT AT THAT MISTER THOMPSON OR THE THIRTY WOULD HAVE SOME MORE SPECIFICS ON THAT BUT- MY UNDERSTANDING IS CERTAINLY IF WE- COME BACK NEXT YEAR WE HAVE MORE CLARITY. THANK YOU AND MISTER THOMPSON DID YOU HAVE ANY SORRY ABOUT THAT CENTER CORTESE ANY OTHER THOUGHTS MISTER THOMPSON. NO I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHO OR WHEN pTHE TIMING MIGHT BE I WOULD CERTAINLY EXPECT THAT THE ATTENTION WILL TURN TO THIS KIND OF THING AFTER THE COMPLETE RELEASE BILL IS SO. ABSORBED AND AFTER THE STRUCTURE OF THE CONGRESS I'M SURE THEY'RE GOING TO BE PASSING A FEW OTHER THINGS AND THEN THEY MIGHT TURN TO THIS. I DO WANT TO ADD THAT MOST FEDERAL PROGRAMS OF THIS KIND. REQUIRES STATE JUNIOR OF ONE KIND OR THE OTHER SO WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALMOST CERTAIN REALLY NOT GOING TO RECORD GOD TO RESCUE US INTO A TELLER DAY. BUT IT CERTAINLY COULD BE VERY HELPFUL. BUT IF THERE IS A STATE SHARE WE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO DISCUSS HOW WE MIGHT PROVIDE IT ONE OPTION. IS THE CAP AND TRADE WHICH MIGHT SUFFICE IF. THE STATE SHARE IS SMALL ENOUGH. BY THE HELL WILL I THINK. BY SUMMER WE SHOULD HAVE MUCH BETTER IDEA OF THE ROLE THAT THE BY THE ADMINISTRATION CAN PLAGUE THE CITY TO CONGRESS TO GETTING ANYTHING DONE. AND CERTAIN WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IS CLOSE TO THE OTHER PROBLEMS THEY FACE. THE MANAGER IF I COULD JUST ASK IF IT'S NOT IT BUT INAPPROPRIATE I DON'T THINK IT IS BUT IT WOULD. I WOULD I WOULD DEFER TO. SENATOR ALSO IS CHAIR OF SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE WHICH TAKES UP TRANSPORTATION. MEETING WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS ANNUAL- IT WAS SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT UP FOR YOU A YEAR- THAT ARE CHAIR CONSIDER A SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE SURE CONSIDER ASKING. THE STATE'S FEDERAL LOBBYISTS TO COME IN INTO TO TRY TO DO A BETTER JOB OF PINPOINTING- THE TIME FOR A PIN POINT IS PROBABLY THE WRONG WORD PUT ESTABLISHING- THE TIME FRAME THIS YEAR. OF WHEN THOSE EXPECTED DECISIONS OR EFFORTS MIGHT BE MADE. OF BECAUSE I DO I DO THINK IT. IT COULD BE CRITICAL IN. IT INFORMING US AS TO WHEN WE MIGHT WANT TO TAKE UP THE SUBJECT MATTER AGAIN OF STATE APPROPRIATIONS CIRCLE BEYOND EXISTING APPROPRIATIONS AND AGAIN I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE IT WAS UNFAIR TO ASK FOLKS WHO WHO AREN'T ON THE SPOT. IN IN WASHING DC AND WORKING THAT SIDE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TODAY FOR THOSE NSWERS BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT POSITION THAT COULD ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND CENTER DRAWS ON ME THAT BE PUT ON THE AGENDA. IN YOUR COMMITTEE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE AND IT LOOKS LIKE SENATOR DID ALSO- HAS OBLIGED TO THAT GREAT WONDERFUL. THANK YOU FOR THAT.
