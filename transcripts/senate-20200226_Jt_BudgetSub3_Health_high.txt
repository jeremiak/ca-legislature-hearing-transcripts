TO ENSURE THAT WE ACHIEVED THE LEVEL ACCESS- FOR ALL MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES- SINCE THAT TIME WHILE IT'S CERTAINLY WE HAD SOME VERY FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS- WE STILL.

WELCOME THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR BEING AT LOOKING FOR TO HEARING YOUR REMARK IN THEM SURE. YOU I ALONE WILL HAVE MEDICAL. THANK YOU. SO I JUST HAVE SOME BRIEF OPENING REMARKS DOCTOR PAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I THINK IT'S BEEN A LITTLE WHILE SINCE YOU'VE HAD A POSITION AS THE DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THIS IS JUST A TWO POINT SIX FOR ME. SO I'M JUST STARTING I AM VERY EXCITED. AND I HAVE I THINK IN SOME WAYS SOME UNIQUE EXPERIENCES THAT WILL REALLY HELP ME IN THE JOB. I HAVE BEEN A PHYSICIAN FOR MANY YEARS I'VE WORKED IN JAIL SYSTEMS WORKED IN A METHADONE CLINIC. I'VE WORKED IN COUNTY CLINICS DURING PRIMARY CARE SOLD SO MOST OF MY- DOCTOR PAN MOST OF MY- THERE IS A PHYSICIAN HAS BEEN FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS REALLY AT RISK I'VE ALSO BEEN A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER IN TWO COUNTIES WHICH I THINK IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT- SO I REALLY UNDERSTAND PUBLIC HEALTH AND POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT ALL OF THOSE PIECES. AND THEN FINALLY AS YOU KNOW I WAS THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER EVENTUALLY THE CEO OF A PRETTY LARGE HEALTH PLAN. THAT DELIVER CARE TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES MEDICAL MEMBERS- AND INDIVIDUALS ARE DULY ELIGIBLE. I HAVE A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON TAKING CARE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PART OF THE TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION AND- TEN POINT FIVE MILLION THAT ARE AND- MEDI CAL THAT. HAS BEEN MY FOCUS MY ENTIRE CAREER AND WILL CONTINUE IN THIS JOB. WE'VE GOT A SUPPORT THE PROVIDERS THE ONES ACTUALLY TAKING CARE OF THE MEMBERS IN THE BENEFICIARIES AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND- YOU KNOW HAVE. REALLY BEEN BLESSED WITH GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH PROVIDERS AND PHYSICIANS THROUGH MY CAREER. WE'VE GOT A SUPPORT EVERYBODY RUNS FOR THE COUNTIES A PROVIDE CARE KIND OF SPORT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS GOING TO SUPPORT THE PRIVATE PROVIDERS MANY PRIVATE PROVIDERS OF PROVIDE CARE. TO WE'VE GOT TO REALLY MAKE SURE WERE YOU KNOW ATTUNED TO AND LISTENING TO THE VARIOUS PROVIDERS TYPES OF PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE CARE FOR. FOR THOSE TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION PEOPLE I ALSO KNOW HEALTH PLANS SO I LAUGHED WHEN I TALKED TO THE HEALTH PLANS ARE VERY EXCITED FOR ME TO BE IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE I SAID WELL THE GOOD NEWS IS. I KNOW HEALTH PLAN THE BAD NEWS IS THAT I KNOW HEALTH PLANS AND I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF AND WHAT CAN BE DONE AND- THAT I THINK CAN CAN REALLY HELP TO WORK WITH THEM TO GET THE THINGS DONE THAT WE NEED TO GET DONE. I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT CAL AND WHEN I SAW THE PROPOSAL COME OUT WHEN I WAS STILL WITH- HELP WHEN I WAS PREVIOUSLY WITH. I THOUGHT IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY BOLD- AND I THINK THERE'S SOME REAL POTENTIAL THERE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR PEOPLE WHICH IS. WHICH IS REALLY THE WHOLE POINT OF WHY WE'RE HERE. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AS A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THE DEPARTMENT SIDE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND HEALTH PLAN SIDE. TO REALLY MAKE SURE WE DELIVER THE PROMISE THAT. THAT HAS BEEN YOU KNOW PRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW THOSE THE SECRETARY IN THE GOVERNOR. SO I AM I AM REALLY. TO DO THE JOB FOR TODAY SINCE IS DAY TWO POINT SIX SEVEN OF JC DO MOST OF THE- BUT I WILL JUMP IN FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN I THINK IT'S HEALTH. FOR REALLY OF J. TO THE PRESENTE. SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU GET THE LEVEL OF DETAIL YOU NEED. TO THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. SO MY COMMENTS ARE DONE REALLY GOING TO FOCUS AROUND TWO MAIN AREAS FOR THIS OPENING AND THEN- DISCUSSION WILL FOCUS ON. OVERSIGHT MONITORING AND THEN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS SPECIFICALLY- SO DCS USES A VARIETY OF WAYS TO OVERSIGHT- ARE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT MONITORING TOWARD MANAGED CARE PLANS INCLUDING NETWORK ADEQUACY. QUALITY MONITORING. ANNUAL AUDITS AND- EVALUATIONS OF. VARIOUS REPORTS APPEALS GRIEVANCES STATE PLAN HEARINGS. FOR NETWORK ADEQUACY SPECIFICALLY- WE DO HAVE A PRETTY ROBUST MONITORING PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES AN ANNUAL AND- NETWORK CERTIFICATION PROCESS. WHICH INCLUDES BOTH TIME AND DISTANCE A PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALTY- SEPARATED BY. PEDIATRICS AND ADULTS. ON IT INCLUDES PRIMARY CARE AND PHYSICIAN RATIOS- AS WELL AS VALIDATION. OF THE MANDATORY PROVIDER TYPES LIKE FQHCS OR BIRTHING CENTERS- WE ALSO HAVE AN- ANNUAL TIMELY. ACCESS STUDY FOR BOTH PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE APPOINTMENTS FOR BOTH URGENT AND NON. URGENT AS WELL AS A DAHLE IN PEDIATRIC- VISITS- WE DO DO OUTBOUND CALLS. ON THROUGH OUR EACH YOU ARE- AND THEN WE PROVIDE MANAGED CARE PLANS A QUARTERLY REPORT. OF THOSE OUTCOMES. SO IF THEY ARE SEEN DEFICIENCIES IN REGARDS TO TIMELY. ACCESS IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO THOSE DEFICIENCIES. REACH OUT TO THOSE PROVIDERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO THOSE. SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT ALSO HAS BEEN LOOKING AT. OUR ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARD PROCESS. AND WE DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST A LARGE NUMBER OF ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE SEEN THIS DECLINE. YEAR AFTER YEAR- AND WE ARE THINKING WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF. AB SIXTEEN FORTY TWO WE WILL ALSO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY. ON THE ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS THAT WILL COME FOR TO THE DEPARTMENT- THERE ARE A FEW OTHER THINGS WERE DOING IN THIS AREA. WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF. THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE CLEAR FINING IN ARE ALL PLAN LETTER MOST. LIKELY WILL GO OUT TODAY OR TOMORROW. AND THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT. AND DISTANCE. WHEN IT COMES TO. YOUR MEANT. I I'M NO LONGER TIME OR DISK. I'M TO ENSURE THAT INTO. ARE HOW A PRO ACCESS TO THIS WILL BE CLEAR. IN A ALL PLAN LETTER WE HAVE BEEN WORK WITH CMS IN REGARDS TO COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PARTICULAR PIECE- AND THAT WILL BE PUSHED OUT AND EVALUATED TO THIS NEXT ANNUAL CERTIFICATION PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY YOU'LL SEE THAT BUT BEGINNING IN JANUARY. OF STARTED JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE DEPARTMENT WILL REQUIRE THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS TO CERTIFY THEIR DELEGATED NETWORKS- SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT IF THEY HAVE DELEGATED NETWORK. THAT THEY ARE MEETING THE SAME NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS PUT ON THE PRIME PLAN OR THE MAIN CONTRACTED PLAN. IT WILL BE THE PLANS RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT CERTIFICATION AND FILE IT WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN WE WILL DO RANDOM AUDITS ON THE CERTIFICATION SO THAT'S FOR JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ON THE PLANS ARE REQUIRED IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO SUBMIT A PLAN OF ACTION TO US TO THE DEPARTMENT. WE ALSO DO YOU POST ALL OF OUR- ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS ON OUR WEBSITE SO IT IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FOR EVERYBODY- TO SEE WHAT- IS THE RESULT OF THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS THESE. AND OF COURSE WHEN NECESSARY DO YOU MOVE INTO CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS IF THEY ARE NOT MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT IN REGARDS TO- ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE SERVICES. ON THE QUALITY SIDE ON THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO MADE SOME NOTABLE CHANGES IN THE LAST YEAR- WE HAVE INCREASED- OR CHANGED OR ARE MEASURES THAT WE ARE NOW INCLUDING ALL- AT THE CMS COURSE THAT MEASURES FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS. WE ALSO HAVE CHANGED OUR MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL- FOR PERFORMANCE FROM 25% TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF FIFTY PERCENT. SO YOU SEE THESE THINGS IN REGARDS TO WHAT WE CURRENTLY BEEN DOING LOOK AT NETWORK ADEQUACY WE ARE LOOKING AT QUALITY WE'VE WE'VE RAISED THE BAR ANY GUARDS RIGHT EXPECTATIONS OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THE LAST YEAR. REALLY HEARING THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED IN REGARDS TO BETTER OVERSIGHT WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND HOW WE CAN PUSH THE NEEDLE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE GETTING ACCESS TO SERVICES. I THINK THE NEXT BIG HING THAT WE LOOK TO AS AN OPPORTUNITY- IS THE PROCUREMENT IN FRONT OF US SO THE DEPARTMENT IS EMBARKING ON. A MANAGED CARE PLAN PROCUREMENT- OTHER COMMERCIAL PLANS IN THIRTY SIX COUNTIES- ON THIS IS THE FIRST SHERMAN THAT WE HAVE. GONE THROUGH VERY TIME CALIFORNIA. AND SO. IN THAT PROCUREMENT WE'RE GOING BE LOOKING FOR A NUMBER O THINGS WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR A HISTORY WRITING. WE WANT PLAN THAT WOULD BE A TO CONTINUE PROVIDE. HIGH QUALITY CARE AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO WILL BE LOOKING FOR PLANS YOU CAN ENSURE THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE NETWORK I'M TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR BENEFICIARIES. WE WILL FOCUS ON PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN EARLY INTERVENTION THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO US TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF MAKING SURE. ON THE CAN PROVIDE THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES TO OUR BENEFICIARIES WE WILL BE LOOKING AT REDUCING DISPARITIES ACROSS OUR PROGRAM IN ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE MECHANISMS TO IDENTIFY AND REDUCE DISPARITIES. WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR COMPETENCIES AND CARE COORDINATION CASE MANAGEMENT COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT AND OF COURSE. UNDER CALLIN ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT WILL BE A CORE FOCUS AS WELL. AS WELL AS- LOOKING AT THE OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE STATE'S IN LIEU OF PACKAGE WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THIS PROCUREMENT PROCESS. AND ALL OF THE CAL IN THE DIRECTIVES IN GENERAL- WE ALSO WILL BE LOOKING AT PLANTS WERE WILLING TO ADVANCE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE DEPARTMENT YOU THINK IT'S CRITICAL ACCESS FOR BENEFICIARIES TO HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE PIECES. AS WELL AS LOCAL PRESENCE IN ENGAGEMENT MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE A LOCAL PRESENCE IN ENGAGEMENT WITH. ON THE LOCAL ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE RIGHT PIECES. SO GIVEN THIS HE DEPARTMENT WILL BE POSTING ACTUALLY ON OUR WEBSITE- EITHER TODAY OR TOMORROW AN UPDATED PROCUREMENT TIME PERIOD. I THINK WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH A TRANSPARENT. PROCESS THAT ALLOWS FOR FEEDBACK AS WELL. WE'RE GONNA PUSH OUR TIMELINE SLIGHTLY JUST TO ALLOW FOR- A FEEDBACK LOOP. ON SO MANY GO OVER SOME TIME LINES TODAY AND THEN YOU'LL SEE UPDATED TIMELINES HAD OUR WEBSITE- SOMETIME THIS WEEK- SO IN APRIL OF THE- YEAR THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONDUCT A STAKEHOLDER WEAPON ARE- IN REQUESTS NIZHAL FEEDBACK OTHER PROCUREMENT ITSELF- AREAS WHERE WE CAN GET FEEDBACK WHERE PEOPLE THINK WE SHOULD REALLY FOCUS CHANGES THEY THINK WE- TO. ZERO IN ON AS WELL AS THINGS THEY THINK WE SHOULD BE VALUE WAITING THROUGH THIS PROCESS. THERE WILL BE A THIRTY DAY KIND OF COMMENT PERIOD THAT WOULD BE OPEN FOR US TO. TAKE THAT FEEDBACK AND FOR IN TUNE PROCUREMENT AND THEN AT THAT POINT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD RELEASE AT THE END OF THE YEAR BY DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. A DRAFT R. F. P. ON THE IT IS COMMON PRACTICE TO RELEASE DRAFT ARE PEAS AND RE RECEIVED COMMENTS- AND THAT WILL GIVE. PEOPLE AN IDEA OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED WHAT WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE R. P. INTO THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS THEY WOULD HAVE ANOTHER THIRTY DAY COMMENT PERIOD FOR THAT. WE REALLY THINK THE COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO PIECES WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE. SOME I'M ROBUST CONVERSATIONS AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT BUT OPEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT'S NECESSARY IN REGARDS TO THAT. THEN WE WOULD RELEASE. THE FINAL ARE FEWER SEEMING SOMETIME IN JUNE. OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. PROPOSALS WOULD BE DUE IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH HE HOPES OF ISSUING AND NOTICES OF INTENT. BY THE END OF JANUARY TWENTIETH- STARTED THE END OF- TWENTY TWENTY ONE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO WE SAY THOSE THINGS BECAUSE- WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE ARE COMING WITH UPDATES IN WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN REGARDS TO MOVING THE NEEDLE AROUND NETWORK ADEQUACY. AROUND QUALITY MONITORING AND THEN A COMMITMENT TO AS WE MOVE FORWARD- OF SELECTING PLANS IN THIRTY SIX COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GIVING YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON- AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT PROJECT AT PROCUREMENT. THE TO. COMMENTS SEVEN ONE IS THE PLAN CERTIFYING THEIR DELEGATED NETWORKS IS ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- IT'S A SIGNIFICANT LIVE FOR THE PLANS AS A LOT OF WORK TO THAT. BOARD INSURERS IS THAT WHEN A MEMBER PICKS. AN IPA OR PLAN THAT'S A SUB CONTRACT TO THE PARENT PLAN. THAT THERE IN FACT GETTING ADEQUATE NETWORK BECAUSE ONE OF THE ISSUESCOULD BE. YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE JOINING THIS PLAN WITH A CERTAIN NETWORK YOU JOIN IPA AS PART OF THAT PLAN- MEDICAL GROUP. AND SUDDENLY YOU ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD THINK SO THAT'S- THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AND IS IT IS. YOU KNOW A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK FOR THE PLANS BUT I THINK. IT REALLY INSURERS A MEMBER THEN. KNOWS YOU KNOW BASED ON THE CERTIFICATION THAT THEY'RE GETTING THAT THEY'RE GETTING A RESULT OUR- THE SECOND ITEM IS. THEM THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL OF A FIFTIETH PERCENTILE NATIONWIDE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SIGNIFICANT I MEAN FIFTIETH PERCENTILE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT MUCH. BUT WHAT IT'S SAYING IS THAT ACROSS THE ENTIRE NATION LOOKING AT ALL THE MEDICAID PLANS. THAT EVERY SINGLE MEASURE THAT THE PLANS ARE BEING MEASURE AGAINST. THEY HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE. AND SO I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE FAILURES I MEAN THERE WILL BE PEOPLE BELOW BECAUSE- SO LAW OF AVERAGES FOR ONE POINT- BUT PLUS IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SIGNIFICANT BAR. I THINK IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A HIGH BAR- BECAUSE IT'LL PUSH PLANS TO YOU KNOW. AND WHAT WOULD BE NICE IS IF YOU KNOW YOU WE GET CALIFORNIA UP THERE. SUDDENLY WERE NOT LOWER THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. SO I JUST YOU KNOW WANT TO MAKE SURE. THOSE TWO IN PARTICULAR BUT MANY OTHER THINGS THE JC MENTIONED ARE. A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. RIGHT THANK YOU- SO I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THAT THEY YOU KNOW I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SO FIRST OF ALL I KNOW THAT. ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES THAT CAME UP THREE YEARS AGO WAS AROUND- OVERSIGHT FOR- ESSENTIALLY THE DELEGATED MODEL THE DELEGATED ENTITIES- EFFECT I CARED A BILL LAST YEAR. WHICH ROUGHLY THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT BUT- HE DID INDICATE IN HIS SIGNING THAT HIS VETO MESSAGE THAT. HE DID NEED A LOT OF DUTIES AND DO WITHOUT A LOT SO. I'M FINE THAT IS ALL THE GETS DONE SO I APPRECIATE THAT- YOU ARE GOING TO ASK- THE- THE PLANTS TO CERTIFY UNDER DELEGATED NETWORKS BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THAT- I DID WANT. YES QUESTION TERMS OF SO. THE SERVER. A NETWORK- HOW HOW. SO MANY THAT'S ON THE FRONT AND THING RIGHT SO YOU APPLY- CERTIFY MY NETWORKS GOOD WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE DYNAMIC HER EIGHT- I. T. A.'S CHANGED PEOPLE COME INTERNET OUT AND SO FORTH- WELL I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WE DON'T. OVERLY BURDEN THE PLANS OF LOTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS- THIS HOUSE APARTMENT THINKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW MONITORING ON AN ONGOING BASIS THE- THESE DELEGATED NETWORK SO ARE WE- THAT EVERY DOWNEY CERTIFYING THEM UP FRONT WHEN THEY FIRST START IS GOOD. IS THERE SOME OTHER MECHANISMS- THAT- EMPLOYED ENSURE THAT THE STATE WITHIN THE STANDARDS THAT YOU REQUIRE AND FORTUNE WE DID HAVE. YEAH WE DID HAVE A COUPLE CIRCUMSTANCES A FEW YEARS AGO WHERE. SOME OF THE DELEGATED ENTITIES- WERE NOT WHAT THEY- SEEM TO. PRADA SO YEAH I STILL OF SCORES. SO WOULD IT JUST BE A ONE TIME CERTIFICATION THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD ANNUALLY FROM THAT POINT FORWARD DEFY ON THEIR THEIR NETWORK ADEQUACY THE DELEGATED ENTITIES AS WELL SO. THAT'S WHY WE'RE GIVING THEM SOME TIME TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE PUT IN PLACE THE SAME MECHANISMS WE HAVE TO ENSURE NETWORK ADEQUACY WHICH IS WHY WON'T GO LIVE UNTIL JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT THEN THEY WOULD DO THAT ANNUALLY. AND THEN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS WE DO TODAY WE HAVE A LARGE- MEDICAL GROUPS LEAVE I'M IF IT'S A SET DATE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER WE HAVE MECHANISMS FOR THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT THAT TO THE DEPARTMENT. DEPENDING ON THE THRESHOLD WE WILL REQUIRE NOTIFICATIONS AND PROCESSES FOR TRANSITIONING LIVES AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ON THAT IN IF THERE IS A CHANGE THAT'S BIG ENOUGH. ON IT OVER A CERTAIN THRESHOLD WE DO RE EVALUATE NETWORK ADEQUACY DURING THE YEAR WE WOULD BE EXPECTING THAT SAME PROCESS OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ON THEIR DELEGATED OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO BASICALLY ANNUAL CERTIFICATION WAS SURE HOW FREQUENT SO ANNUAL CERTIFICATION PLUS NOTIFICAR NOTIFICATION FOR LARGE. CHANGES IN THE NETWORK OKAY. EIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER. I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU WE WANT ALL THE PLANS TO BE ABOVE AVERAGE LIKE LIQUID LIKE WILL BE GONE RIGHT SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT EXPECTATION- APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW THAT'S A HIGH BAR- SO I APPRECIATE YOU RECOGNIZING THAT TO- I GUESS THE QUESTION EIGHT- JUST. REALIZING THAT THE WHAT THE BAR IS AIDED BUT IS WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE FOR NOT MEETING AT SO- I THINK IN THE PAST- SOMETIMES THERE'S BEEN SOME FRUSTRATION AND RECOGNIZES A HIGH BAR BUT- THAT. THE RESPONSE A DIFFERENT AGENCY WHAT WE MONITOR THINGS I SAID WELL MONITORING IS GREAT BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME FLOOR WHERE IF YOU DON'T PERFORM AT THAT LEVEL SO WHETHER TO FIFTY PERCENT. SHOULD BE THE FLOOR NOT. THAT THAT THAT SOME SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES OCCUR SO I MEAN I THINK ON ONE LEVEL YOU KNOW WE- AT I DO LIKE THE YOU GET A CHANCE TO IMPROVE. BUT YOU KNOW HOW MANY CHANCES YET BEFORE LIKE ALL RIGHT WELL. YOU CAN THEN WE'RE NOT WORKING OUT SO HOW DO YOU SEE TAT- MOVING FORWARD IN TERMS OF GOING BEYOND MONITORING AND HAVING CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT HITTING PERFORMANCE TARGETS- SO WE- WE HAVE A VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH WE DO THIS SO WE DO HAVE A PROCESS WHERE IF YOU'RE UNDER CERTAIN THRESHOLD YOU DO UNDER A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN- WHERE THE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO PUT TOGETHER ROBUST PLANS OF HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE IN IN SEE IMPROVEMENTS. THERE'S TARGETS THAT ARE PUTTING THOSE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS AND IF THEY'RE NOT MOVING THEM WE DO REINFORCE THINGS WE HAVE THE OPTION TO SANCTION IF WE GO THROUGH A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WE SEE CONTINUALLY OVER TIME THAT THERE'S JUST NO EFFORT BEING PUT IN. OFTENTIMES MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL STEP UP AND THEY WILL REALLY FOCUS ON THE DEFICIENCIES WITHIN THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN TO HELP MOVE THE NEEDLE ALONG THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES A LARGE AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE HAVE QUARTERLY MEETINGS WE HAVE VARIOUS WEBINARS AND WAYS IN WHICH WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH. OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS- WE DO TO TRY TO PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHEN NECESSARY- BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE THE- THE ABILITY IT INTERNALLY TO IMMEDIATELY SANCTIONALSO IF IT'S SO EGREGIOUS ON ONE END OF THOSE ARELIBERTIES THE DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE IT REGARDS TO EGREGIOUS ACTIONS BUT WE ALWAYS TRY TO WORK WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS FIRST TO SEE IF WE CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE. TO SEE IF WE CAN MOVE THEM ALONG OVER YEARS TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS BEFORE WE MOVED TO SANCTIONS BUT SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON THE ACTION IT IS NECESSARY. WHEN A COUPLE THOUGHTS ONE IS THIS DOES CHANGE THE GAME ABOUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE PLANS ARE GONNA BE INVOLVED IN THAT CORRECTIVE ACTION PROCESS AND SO REALLY TO RAISE THE BAR AND RAISE THE AWARENESS THAT OKAY NOW IT'S THERE IS YOU'VE GOT IT FIFTY MPL. SO I THINK THAT IS ONE WILL JUST BE MORE ENGAGEMENT AMEND THAT MORE ENGAGEMENT MEANS MORE PLANS INVOLVED IN THE DEPARTMENT MORE INVOLVED. I THINK THE SECOND THING IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT KEEPS YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO LOOK AT OTHER ALTERNATIVES WATER OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN MOTIVATE HELL PLAN. TO DOES THAT BE YOU KNOW AND NOT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE COME. UP ANY PARTICULAR SALUTE OCEAN JET BUT- AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT. TO MOW. PEOPLE WE'VE CORRECT ACTION PLANS AND SANCTIONS. OTHER OTHER WAYS TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU MOTIVATE. PLANS TO REALLY PUSH AS HARD AS THEY CAN. YEAH I THINK THE SHEET THAT I THINK THAT ONE OF THINGS WE SHOULD ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT WE IS SERVE. MINIMUM PERFORMANCE STANDARDS SO IT'S LIKE WHAT WHERE'S THE LINE WAY GETS EGREGIOUS RIGHT- SO WHETHER IT'S YOU JUST PERFORMING SO BADLY THAT WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT SOMETHING YOU KNOW- OR- YOU SELLING LACK OF PROGRESS TO A MAYBE NOT AS BAD SITUATION BUT WE EXPECT TO DO BETTER AND YOU JUST DON'T WRITE SO. BE SURE THAT WE THERE ARE SOME- CLEAR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THAT I THINK WHAT. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IS THAT YOU KNOW CORRECTION ACTUAL PLAN AFTER CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN THAT DOESN'T CTUALLY LEAD TO ANY CHANGE SO I GET OUT THAT'S- A SO I DO THINK THAT THAT'S THE OVERSIGHT PART THAT- ZAP WILL ENSURE IS IN PLACE- THAT- PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT- THERE. ARE CONSEQUENCES TO NOT AGAIN YEAH I DO THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHERE WHERE DOES CONSEQUENCE KICK IN. I DON'T WANT THE AND REASONABLE BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THOSE THOSE ARE BEEN FISHERIES I MEAN WHEN THEY'RE NOT DOING WELL. THEN THAT'S FULLER FALSE AND DIED IN I THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT- YOU KNOW WOULD POINT OUT THAT FOR EXAMPLE- ON THE CAPS SURVEY GENERALLY. THOSE PLANS DON'T DO VERY WELL AND THE MEDI CAL SIDE COMPARED TO UNION CAPS IS APPLIED ACROSS MEDI CAL COMMERCIAL MEDICAID PROGRAMS WE DON'T KNOW WELL SO. WHICH THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT WHY IS THAT WHAT WE- THE END IT'S IT NEARLY TO COME IT'S A SASSER. SURVEY WHITE WHITE OR MEDI CAL TO FISHERIES. THEM NOT FEEL AND THEIR PLANS ARE SERVING THEM WELL WHEN. WHEN THAT SURVEY COMES BACK AND WE GET ONE OR TWO STARS ON THOSE PLANS ARE FOR FIVE STARS. SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT- WE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE. LOOKING AT- AS WELL- NOW WANT TO TOUCH ON RATE SETTING- SO- NOW AGAIN THREE YEARS AGO WE HAD- NODES THE- A PRESENTATION ABOUT RATE SETTING I APPRECIATE- AND WE GOT I THINK WE GOT A- POWER POINT- ABOUT HOW. THE RATES ARE SET SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD THEN A GONNA ASK IT AGAIN NOW- SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD AN AUDITOR REPORT THAT SHOWED. UNFORTUNATELY AT. HALF OF CHILDREN IN MEDI CAL WE'RE NOT RECEIVING THEIR- CHECK UPS RIGHT THERE TO WELTS THAT THE RECOMMENDED SUPER WELL SUPERVISION VISITS TELLS FASCINATING ABOUT THE AUDIT REPORT WAS IS THAT. FOR THE AGES AND WHICH WE WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING ON THE OUSIDE THE AUDIT ON A REGULAR BASIS THE PERFORMANCE WAS MUCH HIGHER. IDEALS ABOUT 80% OR SO THAT A RELATIVE THAT WAS AND THEN ON THE OTHER AGES IT WAS A MUCH LOWER SO WHICH WOULD INDICATE TO ME IS THAT IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO. CONSOLES LOOKING THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SAID THIS SO IT'S AND SO WASN'T IN A POSSIBLE TARGET BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE IF SOMEONE WAS COUNTING IT. THEY FOUND A WAY TO GET IT UP TO A CERTAIN LEVEL AND WHEN NO ONE WAS WHEN. PEOPLE WEREN'T LOOKING. IT WAS DOWN OKAY SO THAT WAS THAT WAS A LITTLE DISTURBING BUT THE OTHER THING THOUGH I ALSO RELATE TO RATE SETTING THOUGH IS THAT WHEN WE DEVELOPED. THE SO CALLED TAX SURELY ACCURATE RATES. DO WE ASSUME. THAT ONLY THE REGULAR CHECKUPS. WHICH IS NOT WHAT WE WANT SO WHICH ME ESSENTIALLY THAT'S WHAT WE- THAT'S WHAT WE OFFERED TO PAY FOR. OR DO WE SAY WELL ACTUALLY WE WANT ALL OF THEM TO COME IN AND- IF WE REALLY TRIED REALLY HARD WILL GET 8590% AND THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD ACTUALLY PAY FOR. AND MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PERFORMANCE TARGET WE TAKES MONEY BACK OR SOMETHING OR YOU KNOW THERE'S OTHER SUBSTANTIAL SOLUTIONS TO SO. SO ONE ISSUES THAT I TALKED ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO BALLOT BRING UP AGAIN IS DO WE BAKE IN INTO OUR ACTUARIAL RATES ESSENTIALLY UNDER PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED YEAH THAT'S OUR HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE RIGHT SO. ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE AND SAID DO WE ACTUALLY BREAK THAT INTO THE RATES WILL HAVE AS WE SAY THE RESOURCE WE GIVE YOU IS FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE PAST NOT FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE FUTURE. PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE'S- WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S AN UNDER UTILIZATION AND SO I'M NOT INTEREST IN TEACHING REALIZATION I WANT. LUSATIAN BUT LET'S JUST SO I DOES NOT POSE. BECAUSE THAT QUESTION IN TERMS OF HOW WE DETERMINE THE RATES THAT WE PAY PLANS AND IT'LL AND WHAT GOES INTO THIS ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS- SO ACTUAR RATES DO HAVE TO BE PROSPECTIVE. BUT IT IS DRIVEN BASED OFF OF HISTORICAL UTILIZATION ON THROUGH THAT KIND OF ACTUAR RATE SOUNDING THERE IS ABILITIES TO ACCOUNT FOR KIND OF EMERGING OR ANTICIPATED- EXPERIENCE FOR EXAMPLE- WHEN WE ROLLED OUT THE VALUE BASED PURCHASING. INITIATIVE PROFIT SIX SOON TO THAT THERE WILL BE AN TWO. LET'S.BECAUSE NOW THERE WAS. HE PERFORMING SCENTED. HISTORY PIECES THAT THAT THE WOULD BE IN IN IN UTILIZATION SO WHILE IT DOES HAVE TO BE ACTUAR EARLY SOUND IT DOES HAVE TO BE REASONABLE APPROPRIATE ATTAINABLE. NEEDS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT PLANTS SHOULD BE PROVIDING PREVENTIVE SERVICES THEREFORE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE. AS MANY HIGH COSTLY- SERVICES IT HAS TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THOSE THINGS THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR IF WE FEEL LIKE IT WILL HAPPEN IN ACTUAL IMPACT ON THE RATE- YOU CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. WE WOULD NOTE THAT BASED ON THE PREVENTIVE AUDIT IN THE CURRENT WHAT'S CALLED THE BRIDGE PERIOD WHICH IS THIS EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WE DID NOT MAKE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES. AUDIT HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING IN LIGHT OF BOTH VALUE BASED AND TO THE ADDITIONAL AUDIT THROUGH THIS RATE PERIOD IF WE DO NEED TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT GIVEN THE FACT THAT. IN IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR WE ARE GOING TO BE PUSHING SIGNIFICANT LETTERS OUT TO BENEFICIARIES. NOTICING THEM OF THEIR RIGHTS TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES- AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGAGING IN SERVICES WE'RE GOING TO EXPECT MANAGED. PLANS THROUGH THIS YEAR TO THEN START ON A QUARTERLY BASIS EVALUATING WHAT PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND THEN DO OUTREACH TO PROVIDERS ALL OF THAT IN RESPONSE TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES OUGHT. TO THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING INTO GARCIA SAID THE RATES FOR THE NEXT YEAR WHAT WOULD BE. BOB WE NEED IT MAKE BASED ON THE FOR THAT THERE THE NUMBER. I'M XP THAT WE POTENTIALLY BE IN. THE DOES THERE'S A OF AN SERVICE ALL ADDING. CAN ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN THINGS WITHIN THE RIGHT IF WE SEE IT KIND OF COMING AHEAD OF US OKAY CAN YOU KNOW DR THE ITEM IN THE- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW A PLAN PAYING FOR THINGS IT'S ALL INTERRELATED SO THEY DO BETTER BRING IN KIDS FOR PREVENTIVE SERVICES. THEY RECOGNIZE ASTHMA EARLIER THEREFORE YOU DON'T HAVE THE EXPENSES OVER THERE IN TERMS OF. A CHILD WITH ASTHMA WHO HAS IN THE COMING IN FOR PREVENTIVE SERVICES GOING TO THE ER. SO WHAT I THINK ABOUT THE RATES ALWAYS THINK OF ALL THESE INTER RELATED BALANCING THINGS. BUT ULTIMATELY IT IS BASED TO SOME EXTENT ON EXPERIENCE AND SO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT. BUT I THINK THE PLANS THINK OF IT AS IF WE DO THOSE THINGS. WERE BOARDING COSTS OVER HERE WHICH WE'VE BEEN FULLY PAID FOR SO IT'S KIND OF. BOTH A LITTLE FUNNY YEAH AND THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TRICKY. IN TERMS OF- SAYING THAT TWELVE WE GOT. PUTS A 80% OF ALL THE KIDS THOUGH FOR. GETTING TUTORED AT ONE. WE'D LIKE TO THINK THAT MADE. THE EYES OF A HOUSE WAS A WOULD GO DOWN ALTHOUGH ONE COULD ARGUE THAT PERHAPS WHAT MIGHT ALSO HAPPEN IS WE'LL SEE AN UPTICK IN UTILIZATION CERTAIN OTHER THINGS THE BETTER DENTAL FIGHT ENTREATED. SO YEAH DOES THAT ALSO MAKE NOTICE SAM ONE OF THE MAJOR INITIATIVES THAT WERE ENGAGED IN IS TRYING TO DO ASUS SCREENINGS RIGHT AND- WELL THEY WILL HAPPEN OF RIGHT YOU DIFFERENT SETTINGS OF CERTAINLY IN KIDS- ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO DO IT STRING WATER WHEN WE'RE ONLY A 50% IN. YES WERE MISSING A LOT OF KIDS WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES SCREENINGS I MEAN NOT SAY WE CAN DO SOME OTHER SETTINGS AND SO FORTH BUT- BUT- I THINK THAT- THAT'S- THERE'S A TYPES OF VISITS WERE YOU REPRESS GOING TO SCREENING AND EVEN EVEN SOME INITIAL MITIGATION AND BUT THAT COULD LEAD TO ACTUALLY FURTHER IF WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE FURTHER VISITS. THAT AND UP. YOU KNOW SOME OTHER UTILIZATION BUT WILL SAVE US MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. SO I GUESS THE- THE- SO I A HERE ABOUT THE BACK AND FORTH PRIME CONCERN IS THAT WELL WE SAY THE BACK AND FORTH BUT IN THE END. IF THE PLANS AS WELL WE GO THERE ARE ACTUAL REPEATS BASED ON THE ONLY FIFTY PERCENT OF KIDS COMING AND- I MEAN I GUESS IS A QUALITY MEASURE. THE DVR WOULD THAT NOT SAYING THAT THEY DID THAT'S THE MAIN THING YOU'RE LOOKING AT BUT IT'S A IT'S A SOURCE ADDS A LITTLE BIT OF A WRONG SIGNAL. RIGHT THAT- THAT IT'S THE RATE ISN'T BASED ON AND- IT'S HARD TO SAY WELL IF I ACTUALLY GOT IT FROM 50% THESE CHRONIC DISEASES SO I'M A LITTLE AFRAID TO SAY WELL ACTUALLY THAT'S OR WASHES OUT THAT YOU DO THIS. YOU KNOW WILL- THAT THAT IN FACT ONE COULD EVEN ARGUE AND FROM A POLICY POINT OF VIEW. YOU KNOW DO YOU BUILD IN SOMETHING LIKE PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT. SHOULD BE ON A REGULAR THING INTO A TO EVEN A CAPITATION RATE RIGHT IT'S THE CMS IS WORRIED ABOUT ALL WE WANT PAY FOR VISIT BUT DON'T ACTUALLY HAPPENED. THEN STAY WELL. THIS CALL. AND WE HAD A VERY REGULAR SCHEDULE. AND YEAH YOU. CAN'T DO TWO VISITS IN THE SAME YEAR. WE ALL PAY FOR ONE. BUT IT'S ON THE SCHEDULE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE LAW. OF THE HEALTHY. THE BRIGHT FUTURE SCHEDULE AND SAY. COME IN AND YOU INCENTIVIZE YOU PAID THEY DON'T DON'T TAKE YOU AT. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET. PAID AND- WELL. THE YOU'RE- TO BELIEVE TO GET THE MEN SO ANYA OF THERE'S A SORT OF SAW ABOUT IT THAT AND KNOW I USE MAY CARE AND I TO MOVE PEOPLE THAT FIRST BUT I WOULD I IT WAS PEOPLE ARE THAT SOMETHING LIKE VERTICAL THIS KIND SERVICE IT MAY MAKE SOME CHOICES IF YOU DON'T IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA BUDGET FOR PEOPLE COMING IN THE START WITHIN THE ACT OR RATE THAN THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRIED THAT YOU'LL BE PAYING FOR PEOPLE WHO STILL DON'T COME IN. AND TAKE SPEAK RATE OUT THERE'S NO. YOU KNOW THE- YOU CAN CONTROL IT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON THE A SIX SCHEDULED THIS IS NOT SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT YOUR TRADIO. MEASURE TREATING US. YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU AND I AGREE I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S IN I DON'T THINK PLANTS THINK OF IT AS AN EXPLICIT TRADE OFF RIGHT AND I AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK PLANTS THINK OF IT AS- I'M ONLY GETTING PAID 450% WELL CHILD SO THEY DON'T. BRING KIDS IN WE NEED TO JUST MOE THE PERFORMANCE OF AND I DON'T THINK I MEAN WITH I DON'T THINK IT'S AS MUCH THE MONEY IS IT'S THE PERFORMANCE AT THE BOTTOM. AND PROPERTY SIXES AS HELL BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAD IT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO THE CODES FOR THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES WHICH WHICH YOU KNOW OUR PHYSICIANS REALLY APPRECIATED. AND THAT'S IT THAT'S A DRIVER KIND OF TO ALMOST MITIGATE SOME OF THIS TRADE OFF SOME OF THE TRADE OFF ISSUES THAT ARE THERE. BUT I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK THEY THINK LIKE THAT AT ALL WE JUST HAVE TO DRIVE THE PERFORMANCE YEAH THE ONLY THING I MEAN I AGREE JUST BECAUSE THE UTILIZATION IS WAS DRIVING THE RAY WITH OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BUILT IN IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING OF THE PLANS WE HAVE EXPECTATIONS THAT THEY PER. PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT THE REDUCING HIGH COST UTILIZATION OF SERVICES IN GETTING PEOPLE INTO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE SO I AGREE ON THAT THOUGH IT THAT HISTORY IS WHAT KIND OF BILLS INTO THE RATE. THAT DOESN'T CORRELATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTATIONS OF THE PLANS AND OR THE PLANS EXPECTATIONS IN REGARDS TO GETTING THOSE INDIVIDUALS AT A SERVICES. THIS IS A COMMON APPEAR. OPINION THAT THE AGES ARE SO IT'S COMPLICATED ABOUT WHICH KIDS COME IN FOR CARE AND RICH KIDS DON'T COME IN FOR CARE BUT- YOU KNOW THE- WELL I DO IT DIDN'T. YES ABOUT CIVIC NOTE FOR EXAMPLE WAS- THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE AUDIT THAT ACTUALLY WON THE AGES FOR YOU SAW THE LOWEST NUMBER OF VISITS I THINK WAS. AS H. TWO THREE. WAS AGE TO. THAT YET THAT'S BAD BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES HAD ENGAGED TO AND THEY WEREN'T LOOKING AT AGE TO SO IS LOW AND THEN THE ONLY LOOK AT AGE FOUR AND THAT WAS. GOOD SO- YEAH THAT OKAY YEAH THAT'S NOT OKAY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ADDED ALL OF THE CHILDREN AND ADULTS CORPS MEASURES TO. NOW ARE SET SO THAT. IF WE'RE MONITORING ALL OF IT HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE TO ALL HOPEFULLY WE WON'T SEE THOSE HUGE SWINGS WHERE IF WE'RE NOT MONITORING IT. THERE'S NO THEM NO ACTION OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT- IS IT I JUST EIGHTY AND MY OBSERVATION IS THAT. WHEN SOMEONE'S LOOKING THEY SOMEHOW WE WERE ABLE TO BETTER SO THE NET MUST KNOW HOW TO DO BETTER. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT IT'S LIKE I DOING IT OR NOT. SO NOW HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR. TOBY OVER HOPEFULLY WE'RE DOING THINGS ELEVATORS WE'RE TRYING TO BUY. AND INSTALL THAT UTILIZATION BUT SOMETHING'S IN TERMS OF AGAIN THESE SO YEAH. TRY TO GO WITH THE ACTUAR- RATE IS- HOW OLD CITY TAKE FOR CHANGES IN UTILIZATION TO SHOW UP IN. THE DATA YET ENCOUNTER DATA AND IT'S- INTO THE- CATION. SO I'LL- HAVE TO DO SO WHEN YOU TO. THE CAP. RATE. FOR THE PLAN. WHAT'S THE LAG TIME IN AND IF STILL LIKE TO. SO BASICALLY TRY TO FIGURE OUT LIKE HOW HOW WE SHOULD INSTEAD OF. THE PLAN. TO SERVICE MY- FOR THE RIGHT WORD HOW DO WE SURE THE PLAN IS ACTUALLY PAID APPROPRIATELY. FOR THE THIS IS THEIR DELIVERING IT UNDER A CAPITATED RATE DOES SO THERE IS A LAG BETWEEN DOUBT. THAT WE WANT THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS AND YET WE'RE NOT PAYING FOR IT BECAUSE WE HAVE A WE NOW HAVE A LACK. SO THERE IS A TWO YEAR LACK FROM- ENCOUNTER DATA TO THE UTILIZATION THAT'S BUILT INTO THE CAPITATION RATE- BUT AS I WAS MENTIONING EARLIER. WE DO HAVE PROCESS SEES THROUGH THE ACTUARIAL SOUNESS WHERE IN ADDITION TO UTILIZATION WE CAN. PRIOR TO SEEING IT COMING THROUGH ON ENCOUNTER LOOK TO IF WE KNOW WE'RE ROLLING OUT A BIG CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. WEEKEND BUILDER FACTOR THAT INTO THE RATE. ON IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE US A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS BUILT AROUND IT TO- AND IT WOULDN'T BE AS IF IT WAS YOU WERE SEEING IT IN THE UTILIZATION. THEY DO HAVE THAT ABILITY BUT IT IS A TWO YOUR LOG IN REGARDS TO ENCOUNTER DATA COMING IN AND THEN THAT BILLY BEING BUILT INTO THEIR- INTO THEIR RATE. PURSER THE SUPPLEMENTAL DATA FOR US. THEY'RE VERY FREQUENTLY WHEN WE SEE CHANGES OCCURRING IN ANY PARTICULAR BENEFIT OR ACTIVITY. THE DEPARTMENT ASKED THE PLAN FOR SUPPLEMENTAL DATA REQUESTED A ROOM THAT ARE MUCH MORE FREQUENT THAN. EVERY TWO YEARS. AND THAT ALLOWS THAN THOSE FACTORS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. ON A MUCH MORE I MEAN REAL TIMES LITTLE HARD BECAUSE OF THE TIME FRAME TO DO. THE ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS BUT A MUCH MORE REAL TIME BASIS THAN TWO YEARS AND THAT IS WORKED. FOR CERTAIN THINGS WELL. I THINK THAT'S WHERE THEY DO TRY TO MAKE IT ADJUSTMENTS WHERE APPROPRIATE AND WHERE THERE'S DATA OR SOME SINCE TO. TO BUILD ON IT BUT- ON FULL HISTORY UTILIZATION THERE IS THE LACK. AND IN RELATION TO FOR EXAMPLE THE DOING THAT WITH THESE PURCHASING OTHER TYPES OF THINGS- IN TERMS OF THE- RISK FULL RIGHT OF ANNOUNCED THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT'S ONLY WHEN PLAN BUT IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PLANS. IN THE COUNTY OR IN A REGION- AND SUPPOSE SOMEONE DECIDES A SIDE TO TAKE ON A VALUE BASED INITIATIVE THEY ATTRACT MORE OF THE PEOPLE WITH. A CHRONIC CONDITION TO THEIR PLAN. IS THEIR INABILITY TO HOW LONG IT TAKES TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT FOR. CHANGING CASE MIX. BETWEEN THE- IN AN AREA SO WE GET THIS GOES BACK TO SAYING LIKE WE SHOULDN'T BE PENALIZING PEOPLE FOR. ATTRACTING MORE PEOPLE CRISES LAWS OF THE TAKE BETTER CARE OF THEM. SO I DO BELIEVE IN ME I WOULD WANT TO GO BACK AND CHECK WITH OUR TIME TO BE A CERTAIN BUT THEY DO SET AN ANNUAL RATE FOR THE YEAR AND THEY DO LOOK AT THAT CASE MAKES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN REGARDS TO SETTING THOSE RATES BUT- I'D WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK IN REGARDS TO HOW THAT'S INCORPORATED- DON'T SPEAK OUT OF. OKAY NOT BE CORRECT SO WE CAN GET YOU THAT A OKAY SO YEAH I'D BE INTERESTED IN THAT AND ALSO THINKING ABOUT WHAT MECHANISMS TO HAVE IN PLACE ESPECIALLY WE'RE TRYING TO DO TRUE VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO. PROVIDE BETTER QUALITY CARE PEOPLE'S CHRONIC DISEASES AND YOU HAVE LET'S SAY MULTIPLE PLANS IN AN AREA AND ONE PLAN ACTUALLY STANDS OUT. AND MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT PLAN STANDS OUT THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY SIGN UP FOR THAT PLAN. AND ASK FOR THE PLAN. THEY SHOULD BE THE PLAN SHOULD BE PENALIZED FOR PICKING UP PATIENTS TO MAY HAVE HIGHER NEEDS. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE CRIED DISEASES IF THEY DO A GOOD JOB BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB NOW. WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE. MAKE THEIR CHOICES AND SO FORTH BUT IT'S I THINK THAT'S PART OF VALUE BASED PURCHASING THINGS SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY PUT IN THE THINGS IN PLACE TO. MAKE THEMSELVES BETTER AT DOING AND BECOME MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN. WE MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE NOT PENALIZE A PLAN THAT. DISPROPORTIONATELY. TRACKS A- LARGE DON'T. WITH MORE. EXPENSIVE FOR. YOU KNOW CONDITION THAT MIGHT. BECAUSE OUR CASE MAKES A CHAIN RIGHT THERE IS A RISK ADJUSTMENT PROCESS IS PART OF THAT YOU KNOW THE OVERALL RATE DEVELOPMENT. RIGHT YEAH SO EXACTLY HOW HOW HOW MUCH OF A LAGGED THERE'S ON THAT TOO SO. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. AND THEN- THE OTHER THING YOU KNOW WE AND EIGHT YOU SEE WE- WE TALKED ABOUT- YOU SAID YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING TIME AND DISTANCE AND- WE DON'T WE HAVE A AND HAD THE ODD TO REPORT THAT LOOKED AT- IN TERMS OF- AND DO TALK ABOUT THE REDUCTION IN THE DECREASE AND I'LL SHOW FORGET THE TERM ITSELF A YES THAT THE ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS SORRY. AND SO IN TERMS OF RATE SETTING. THE HOUSE- HOW DOES THE RATE CITY ACCOUNT FOR THE PLANS REQUIREMENTS PROVIDE APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO CARE AND PARTICULARS- ZIP CODE SO COUNT FOR THE NUMBER AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION PLAN AND ALSO AND SO FORTH SO IT SAID FACTORED IN INTO THE- INTO THE- RATE SETTING PROCESS IN TERMS OF- WELL. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO FEEL THE CONTRACT WITH CERTAIN SPECIALISTS THERE IN THE AREA. AND THAT MAYES SO I MEAN THE RATES BUILT ON AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING ALL OF THE SERVICES WE ARE CONTRACTING WITH RIGHT FOR AN APPROPRIATE UTILIZATION BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS IN AND FORMULAS- AND THEN BASED ON UTILIZATION EXPERIENCE FROM THAT MANAGED CARE PLAN- SO ESSENTIALLY IT IS SOON AS THOSE THINGS BASED ON. HISTORICAL PRACTICES NOW IF THE END IT DEPENDS IN ACCESS TO SERVICES THAN THAT WOULD SHOW UP IN FUTURE RATE SETTING BY GUESS THE QUESTION IS LIKE OKAY SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM TO NOT DO AS MANY ALTERNATIVE ACCESS RATES ON PEOPLE FAR AWAY BUT THAT'S THEIR HISTORY IN THE PASSES WERE TRYING TO MOVE THEM ALONG. AND THEY MAY HAVE I DON'T KNOW THEY'D BE THERE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET BETTER RATES BY. FINDING SOMEONE FARTHER AWAY. THIS IS THE DOES THAT GET BAKED INTO THEIR ACTUAR RATE IS THEY'RE LOOKING AT NOW THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO MOVE THE FOR AT SO I'M JUST AGAIN THINKING ABOUT HOW THINGS MIGHT BE TO GET BAKED IN OR NOT BECAUSE WE- YEAH I REALIZE THAT. THE FORTY WE DON'T HAVE DEAL FALLS PERSPECTIVES OFTENTIMES WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. THE DATA STRUGGLE DATA TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE BUT SO I'LL SAY ONE THING THEN YOU. SO EVEN IF THAT SO EVEN IF IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S ONLY WITHIN THAT COUNTY- SPACERS ZIP CODE. THE PLAN IS RESPONSIBLE OF SERVICES EVEN IF THEY HAVE COURTNEY SOME GOING UP YOU KNOW ACROSS THE STATE OR DROUGHT FAR. THERE WERE. SERVICES GUARD LESSON SO. THIS IS THERE A- WOULD BE BILL. INTO THE RAY. IT EVEN IF THEY- ULTIMATELY HAD TO PAY A HIGHER RATE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAD ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES. THOSE WOULD EVENTUALLY BE BUILT IN- SO IT IS EVERYTHING THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WITHIN THEIR EVEN IF IT'S OUTSIDE OF THAT. AREA SO YOU HEARD ME SAY. YOU KNOW YOU DON'T PAY ALWAYS PAY MEDI CAL TO PROVIDERS BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN PROVIDERS THAT YOU NEED. FOR ACCESS THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY YOU KNOW CLOSE. MEDICARE SO TO THAT THEN GETS BUILT INTO THE RATE IT IF THERE IS A LAG. BUT SO THE WAY I THINK OF IT IS. THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSIBILITIES TO MAKE SURE THERE'S THE ADEQUATE. ACT PASSED. PUSH PLANS TO DO THAT. PLANS AND TO DO WHAT THEY- DO. IN TERMS OF. PAYING THAT ONE PROVIDE THAT'S GOT A BIT OF A- COUPLE. THE TO. TACKLE AREA. MORE THAN MEDI CAL IN THE- GETS OF THE- FLOWS. THE RATE. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE- COST. WAS DATE OF. PRESENTED THE- DEPARTURE. I WOULD NAY THEM. HEARING THREE YEARS AGO. GET SEVERAL. HERE AND OF THE PLAN ARE ACTUALLY. ACTUALLY MEDIC RATES. ALMOST ALL THE- AND OTHERS. WEREN'T WERE LIKE. WHY IS IT IS THIRTY FEET. DIFFERENT PLANS- IN TERMS OF THE RATES ARE PROVIDING FOR WRITERS INSTANT IN THE SAME MEDICAL PROGRAM WILL RECOGNIZE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIES ETCETERA. AND WHY CAN'T WE TRY TO DO IS THAT FOR. ACROSS THE BOARD MEDI CAL BUT THAT SOLD. BUT WE'LL JUST LEAVE THAT THEIR- HERE THAT- NAY THEY THINK CELL HAS NOW IT'S RIGHT I THINK YOU WERE. ALL RIGHT- SO WITH THAT- I WANT THANK YOU SO MUCH WELL ACTUALLY IF YOU DON'T MIND ME BILLS HAVE SE SYNTHESIZER WILL BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL- AND- NOTICE SEATS MIGHT BE MORE COMFORTABLE ALTHOUGH THE CAMERAS MAY NOT BE AS COMFORTABLE. BUT THAT WE FOCUS ON THE OTHER PEOPLE TESTIFYING. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO LET'S BRING UP FOR NEXT PANEL I WANT TO WELCOME AND THANK. LESS ABERA EXITING DIRECTOR FOR ANTHEM BLUE CROSS IN JERRY MAGUIRE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND SHE DEVELOPED FOR KERN HEALTH SYSTEMS. WELCOME AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND- SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES- WITH MEDIC HOW RATE SETTING AND- NETWORK ADEQUACY IN PROCUREMENT SO. YOUR FIRST. THANK YOU DOCTOR PATH. THANK YOU DOCTOR FIFTH. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE UNLESS THE BAR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ANTHEM I HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR OVERALL PROGRAM MANAGEMENT OF THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE. HEALTH PLAN IT ANTHEM. SO THAT INCLUDES- ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT WITH OUR COUNTY PUBLIC AND THEY HAVE A WHOLE DEPARTMENTS. OUR LOCAL ENGAGEMENT MODEL OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF OUR- LA CARE SUBCONTRACTOR AGREEMENT GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF ARTILLERY COUNTY LOCAL INITIATIVE AGREEMENTS. AND I'VE ALSO BEEN SERVING THE MEDI CAL POPULATION- MEDICAMENTO CARE POPULATION FOR TWENTY YEARS WITHOUT THE- I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE A COUPLE REMARKS ABOUT OUR COMMITMENT TO THE MEDICARE POPULATION ACROSS THE TWENTY NINE COUNTIES THAT WE SERVE. THAT WEREJUST OVER ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION MEMBERS ACROSS THOSE COUNTIES- A COLLEAGUE OF MINE WILL BE SPEAKING WITH YOU HERE SHORTLY WITH REGARDS TO THE HEALTH HOMES PROGRAM AND SIX OF THOSE COUNTIES. AND ALSO SERVING NINE COUNTIES IN THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PROGRAM IS REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE IT WITH OUR FOOTPRINT OF THAT. EACH COUNTY THAT WE SERVICE IS UNIQUE IN TERMS OF. THE NEEDS OF THOSE POPULATIONS AND I THINK AS WE'VE- REALLY LEARNED- YOU KNOW VERY RURAL AREAS VERY URBAN AREAS- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE WITH REGARDS TO FINDING SOLUTIONS AND TAILORING OUR PROGRAMS- TO WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE NEEDS- THEY WERE COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH WORKING WITH THE COUNTY STAKEHOLDERS OTHER. COMMUNITY LEADERS. AND SERVICES THAT WE CAN BRING- AS A LARGE HEALTH ORGANIZATION TO THE COMMUNITY. AND SOME OF THOSE- CONCEPTS- HAVE BEEN BORN OUT OF. DISASTER RELIEF EFFORTS FOR EXAMPLE- WHERE WE OFFERED KIOSKS LOW FOR URGENT CARE SERVICES. WE RECENTLY BEEN REALLY ENGAGED WITH COUNTIES- STEPPING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS DOWN FROM. MODERATE TO SEVERE TO THE TO THE TO THE MILD TO MODERATE CATEGORIES USING SOME TELL HEALTH SOLUTIONS. AND WE STARTED ROLLING OUT OF TELL INTERPRETATION SERVICES THAT SOME OF OUR CLINIC PARTNERS. SUCH THAT WERE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH A LIVE VIDEO- TELL INTERPRETATION- AND PAY FOR THE PAY FOR THOSE COSTS FOR OUR MEMBERS. I THINK THAT- AS RELATES TO ENABLING ACCESS. YOU KNOW A LOT A LOT OF A LOT OF WORK IS BEING DONE AT A LOCAL LEVEL AND I'VE BEEN PERSONALLY IN CASE. WITH WHAT WITH MY DIRECT TEAM AS WELL- MEETING WITH THOSE LOCAL I. COUNTY LEADERS AND REALLY. PARTNERING UP ON DIFFERENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU KNOW FUNDING- AS IT RELATES TO MAKING INVESTMENTS AND- SOMETIMES IT'S HEALTH SYSTEMS CLINICS SYSTEMS OR EVEN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. THE COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THAT EVEN HERE LOCALLY WE ARE PARTNERING UP WITH THE CLINIC. AS IT RELATES TO THEIR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY PERFORMANCE WE ALSO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A CAR AND- EQUIPMENT SUCH AS- ULTRASOUND EQUIPMENT AGAIN REALLY TRYING TO ENABLE ACCESS AND FINDING DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE MORE LOCAL AND MORE. FOCUSED ON YOU KNOW WITHOUT AND INDIVIDUAL LEADERS. THANK YOU WELCOME. OKAY THANK YOU A CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY OBVIOUS ON TO HAVE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF NETWORK ADEQUACY AND QUALITY MEASUREMENTS SOME GERMAN MCGUIRE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT FOR CURRENT HEALTH SYSTEMS AND WE ARE THE LOCAL PLAN SERVING KERN COUNTY HOW WE HAVE OVER TO OUR FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBERS SO. WE ARE THE PLAN CREATED THROUGH COUNTY ORDINANCE. AND SO WE ARE PUBLICLY MANAGED TO SPEAK IN OUR OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS ASSIGNED BY THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SO YOU KNOW THE GIVEN OUR GEOGRAPHY THE MAIN SEE A CITY CENTERS BAKERSFIELD AND WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF RURAL AREAS IN OUR COUNTY SO. HAVING THAT MAKES A WE- HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN TERMS OF NETWORK ADEQUACY- AND OF COURSE DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES WE CERTAINLY TAKE. TAKE THOSE CHALLENGES SERIOUSLY REMAIN COMMITTED TO THAT SO I WANT TO TALK. YOU KNOW IN MY BRIEF- MOMENTS TO DO A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF- THE SOME OF THE AREAS NETWORK ADEQUACY AND METRICS THAT WE USE AND THEN. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT QUALITY SO. YOU KNOW AT A HIGH LEVEL IN TERMS OF NETWORK ADEQUACY WE TAKE THE MENTALITY THAT WE WILL CONTRACT WITH ANYONE PROVIDER- WHO MEET STANDARDS OF COURSE THAT'S IMPORTANT CABBIE OUT WE WANT THEM TO. PROVIDE QUALITY CARE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CREATE A NARROW NETWORK IN GENERAL. ON TOP OF THAT WE DO GO FOR ENHANCED FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICARE RATES- GENERALLY. SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE AND TRYING TO ATTRACT A PROVIDERS INTO THE NETWORK. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE LATER YOU KNOW COMMUNITY GRANTS- WHERE WE WILL FUND CERTAIN INITIATIVES TO MAKE SURE WE'RE WE'RE FILLING HOLES- IN THE NETWORK AND OR- SOMETIMES EVEN PHYSICAL SPACE. AND WE DO THINGS LIKE A PAY FOR PERFORMANCE TYPE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WHICH I CAN TALK TO A LITTLE BIT MORE. I'M IN THE QUEUE IN A AND THEN. WRAPPED AROUND WITH THINGS LIKE TELEMEDICINE. AND THEN AND METRICS IN A HERD OF THE POWER FROM THE CHEST TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THE METRICS WE DO. TAKE SERIOUSLY OF STAFF DEDICATED YEAR ROUND TO MAKING SURE. THAT AND IT'S NOT JUST AN ANNUAL EXERCISE SOME THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE VARIOUS THINGS. SO IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY. YOU KNOW FIRST THE WHEN THE AUDIT CAME OUT WE DID TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY WE REVIEWED IT- WE LOOKED IT OVER. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REVIEWED OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES- AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS WHATEVER WE NEEDED TO OF COURSE WE WORK WITH THE PARTNERS A DH CS WHAT WAS COMING DOWN THE CHANGES THAT. WENT OUT. AND THEN WHAT WE CAN GET INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE EXACT THINGS WE DID WE YOU KNOW WE REVISE OUR P. FOR P. PROGRAM TO ALIGN WITH. YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING DOWN THE ROAD. WE DID A LOT OF EDUCATION TRAINING WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON GOING TO HAVE TO OUR PROVIDER NETWORK TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT WAS COMING. WE DO INNOVATIVE THINGS LIKE PROVIDING REAL. DATA TO OUR PROVIDERS- SO THAT THEY KNOW WHO'S MISSING SERVICES BECAUSE THEY NEED NOT TO KNOW WHEN THEY NEED HELP. AND OF COURSE IT. AND UPDATES AND SOFTWARE IT'S AN- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A- BUS QUEUE I PROGRAM. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. SO ALL ALSO WAS INFLUENCED BY THIS OF XIN. AND THEN THE MEMBER ENGAGEMENT COMMUNICATION SO THAT'S HUGE- YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE ARE ENGAGING IN THE MEMBERS TO GET THEM TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS AS WELL. STOP THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS- QUESTIONS. THE OKAY THAT'S ALRIGHT OKAY WELL I WILL THEN I JUST I'M SURE PEOPLE AND SO- FOR SO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS- IN TERMS OF THE SO. THE HEALTH V. AND ACTUALLY SERVICES I KNOW YOU'RE IN KERN COUNTY RIGHT NOW HOW MANY COUNTIES IS AND SOME OF THEM IS IN TWENTY NINE COUNTY MONEY NINE COUNTIES OKAY. AND LOOSE ME ON MOST OF THEM ARE- RULE CORRECT OR DO A TWO YEAR AND FOUR AND EIGHTEEN RURAL COUNTIES YEAH OKAY- SEVERAL OR WERE IN THE BAY AREA SACRAMENTO COUNTY RIGHT. YEAH AN AIR OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA OKAY AS THE KINGS WITH EVERY TULARE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS WELL OKAY SO BILL BASED ON THE AUDITS FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WE- WOULD TO OUT ITS ONE TALKED ABOUT CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE AND- THE- THE RATHER FOR. YOU KNOW PERFORMANCE THERE- AND THEN- THE OTHER HAD TO DO WITH AGAIN- NETWORKS PARTICULARLY AND TO UNDERSTAND CHALLENGES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES SO- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS A YEAR THE PLAN NOW YOUR JOB YOU ARE YOUR JOB IS TO PUT TOGETHER TO NETWORK. EIGHT WE HAVE WE TALK ABOUT NETWORK OUT OF SENATOR ANDERSON THE AGENCIES POINT OF VIEW BUT THEN YOU'RE TO ONE US THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD RIGHT TRYING TO PUT THAT TOGETHER- WHAT WOODY AND- HI SOON YOU'RE FAMILIAR TO AUDITOR'S REPORT. SO WHAT. THE. THE BARRIERS TO TRYING TO GET THE TO BUILD THE NETWORKS YOU NEED TO BUILD- AND ALSO TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THE USE OF- OTHER OF PROVIDE ARRANGEMENTS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO THAN TRAVEL FARTHER AWAY AND SO FORTH- AND- ACTUALLY DODGE DID NOTE THAT TO BE ONE PLAN THAT SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO CONTRACT AND THE OTHER PLANNED. ISN'T SO CONTINUE THE SO MAYBE FIGHT THE- BILL SPEAKS THAT CELL YEAH MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT. JUST THE CONTRACTING APPROACH THAT WOULD REALLY FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT WE HAVE ALL THE LARGE THE WHITE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. AS WELL AS THE TERTIARY HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE FOR SPECIALTY CARE EXAMPLES OF THAT COULD BE UC DAVIS UC SAN FRANCISCO. YEAH COUNTY SYSTEMS AND CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS PUTTING THEIR PHYSICIAN GROUPS- AND REALLY LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE ALL AVAILABLE TO OUR MEMBERS. I THINK WHERE WE YOU KNOWHAVE CERTAIN AREAS YEAH LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT ACTUALLY MAY ONLY A PROVIDERS MAILING CONTRACT WITH ONE PLAN. YOU KNOW WE TYPICALLY- SEE THAT AS A RESULT OF CAPACITY AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL- THEY YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WILL. ONLY BE WILLING TO OPEN UP TO ONE PLAN OR THE OTHER BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR CAPACITY- WE TEND OF DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES- BY WAY OF SINGLE CASE AGREEMENT- AS IT RELATES. TO CASES. BUT WE'RE CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING OPPORTUNITIES THE CONTRACT IN FACT SO ALSO OFFERING AN OPEN NETWORK MODEL. BY WAY OF REACHING OUT LEVERAGE OUR NETWORKS ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE AS WELL AND IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE EITHER. MEDICARE COMMERCIAL. AND LEFT A INCH FOR THE OFF. ON TRACK FOR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE AND YOU KNOW IN ANY IS IN WERE ABLE TO- BRING THOSE IN. AND JUST THE LAST- AMONG REBEL OUT OF FORTY TWO SPECIALTY. BY LARA ARKHAM NETWORKS. BUT A- HEARING ABOUT THAT. AS ECHO ONLY IS NOT GEN PROVIDE AND NOT EXPECT MEDICARE TO BE THE GENEROUS. BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT LEVERAGING YOUR NETWORK AND SO I MEAN I'M A PHYSICIAN NAY THAT AND THAT WAY HERE FROM OTHER POSITIONS IS THAT- OKAY YOU SOMETIMES IT'S ARE LIKE WELL YOU KNOW YOU TAKE THE COMMERCIAL THEN WE WANT TO TAKE THE MEDICAL OR EIGHT IT IS SO THIS. IS AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE ON YOUR MEDI CAL NETWORKS WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE NOW MAYBE BECAUSE OF JUST WANT TO TAKE FROM THE COMMERCIAL OR THE MEDICARE BY. BUT TO WHAT DEGREE I GUESS AND EIGHT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT. THAT PEOPLE MOST TWENTY THREE ONE DO YOU SEE PROVIDERS ACTUALLY WILLING TO TAKE THE MEDIC HOW. A CONTRACT ON ITS OWN WITHOUT HAVING TO SAY THAT WELL BECAUSE WE BUNDLE THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE NOW YOU'LL TAKE IT IN THE LORD'S REPAYING ENOUGH AND THAT WE PROVIDING A HIGH ENOUGH RATE SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRACK PROVIDERS. TO ACTUALLY JUST TAKE THEM CAL CONTRACT WITHOUT HAVING TO SAY WELL ACTUALLY WILL YOU ALLOW ONLY TAKE THE MEDICAL CONTRACTED I GET THE OTHER CONTRACTS. I MEAN I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S COMMUNITY IS THERE DEFINITELY HAS ITS OWN NUANCES OF FOR EXAMPLE. YEAH WE ARE WILLING TO OFFER COMMERCIAL RATES OR UP TO MEDICARE RATES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES- WHERE THEY THEY WOULD LIKE TO CONTACT WITH ALL PRODUCTS AT A AT A SPECIFIED RATE WE'RE WILLING TO LOOK AT THAT- ESSENTIALLY OFFERED THE SAME RATE FOR EVERYTHING RIGHTS OF YOU SEE PATIENT IN OUR NETWORK WHAT IS MEDI CAL MEDICARE OR COMMERCIAL WE PAY THE SAME RATE AS THAT WE TALKING ABOUT. IT WE CAN I'M SAYING IS INDIVIDUALIZED IN TERMS OF. WHAT WHAT MARK YOU WHAT WHAT PARTICULAR SPECIALTY- YOU KNOW WHAT PARTICULAR AREA THAT WE'RE SERVING- IF THERE ARE YOU KNOW ANY GAPS IN SPECIALTY CARE AND WE ONLY HAVE. YOU KNOW A SMALL VOLUME SPECIALS THAT EVEN EXIST IN THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY AT THAT POINT WE CAN SIT DOWN AND- AND SOME KIND. OF THE VERY LOW INCOME. WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE A COMMERCIAL POPULATION TO SERVE AND THEY WERE WELCOME HAVING A MUCH LARGER MIX OF. COMMERCIAL PATIENTS HOWEVER THEY THEY AND THEY AREN'T IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEREFORE THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED IN CONTRACTING FOR THE MEDICAL. OF PRODUCT BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE COMMUNITY. THAT THEY'RE SERVING SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ABLE TO OFFER A SIGNET AT A AT A GOOD NOT FREIGHT THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO THAT'S ABOUT THAT'S- I MEAN. I THINK OUR EXPERIENCES. HONESTLY IT IS IT'S LESS ABOUT RATES AND IT TENDS TO BE ABOUT CAPACITY ON THE PROVIDER WILLING TO- OPENED THE DOORS I THINK TO THE MEDIC CALLED MANAGED CARE POPULATION. AND HOW YOU KNOW HOW MUCH- ACCESS THEY'RE WILLING TO PROVIDE WELL LET ME LEAVE PUSH BACK ON THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT AND- LIKE TO PUSH BACK AND EXPLORE THAT A LITTLE BIT IS THAT- SO. D. E. AREA FOR WRITER DATE YOU CAN ONLY SEE SO MANY PATIENTS RIGHT NOW. THEN THE QUESTION IS THAT HOW THEY- THAT AND THE OTHER THING YOU ALSO HAVE TO DO IS BE SURE THE PRACTICE MAKES ENOUGH MONEY TO YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO PAY THE RENT DEBTS PAID STAFF STAFF TO YOU KNOW PAY FOR SUPPLIES AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF TOO. SO WHEN YOU SAY CAPACITY SOMETIMES THE CAPACITY ISSUES BECAUSE I LOVE THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN MOST OF THE SESSIONS I KNOW- DON'T WANT TO TURN AWAY MEDI CAL PATIENTS. RIGHT NOW I MEAN THEY'RE NOT DIDN'T DECIDE TO BE DOCTORS INTIMACY MEDICAID- BUT THEY ALSO RECOGNIZE IN ORDER FOR THE PRACTICE TO BE VIABLE THEY CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY. IT WILL BE THE MEDI CAL PROVIDER AND HAVE IT'S LARGER BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY UNSUSTAINABLE THIRTY COULD NOT. THE PRACTICE COULDN'T STAY ALIVE. AND SO. I'M JUST TRADERS SAY THAT WHEN YOU'RE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AND PERHAPS IT'S ALSO ONE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MORE DIRECTLY WITH THE PROVIDER. IS THAT I IT THE REASON THEY THEY ONLY HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CAPACITY FOR THE MEDI CAL PRODUCT BECAUSE- THAT'S AS MUCH AS THEY'RE ABLE TO DO. FISCALLY FURTHER PRACTICE AND STILL KEEP THE PRACTICE IN BALANCE- FINANCIALLY OR IS THAT REALLY THAT CAPACITY THAT THEY YOU KNOW REALLY HAVE BECAUSE THEY GOT PAID ENOUGH THEY COULD THEN TAKE ON NOW THE FORCE DOWN IT'S A MIX OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE RD COULD EXPAND AND TRY TO BRING SOMEONE ELSE ON BORDER. BRING ON SOME MORE YOU KNOW OTHER STAFF SAYS THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY SEE IF YOU MORE PATIENCE. I'D I DO THINK IT VARIES QUITE A BIT I THINK IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES ABSOLUTELY THE FISCAL ISSUES I THINK OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES A VERY MUCH A CAPACITY ISSUES ARE. HOW MANY PATIENTS PARTICULARLY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL PHYSICIANS. I WE WE'VE TEND TENDED MORE RECENTLY THE FOCUS OF ON THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ENSURING THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THE SPECIALISTS THAT ARE ADMITTING TO OUR NETWORK HOSPITALS. AND FOR EXAMPLE IN RURAL AREAS WE'VE CONTRACTED WITH EVERY AVAILABLE HOSPITAL. AND IS PART OF THE SWEEP AND YOU KNOW THE KIND OF. VIEW OF HOW WE CAN EXPAND THE NETWORK REALLY CAN'T EVERYONE THAT HAS PRIVILEGES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN THE NETWORK AND OPEN TO OUR- TO OUR MEMBERS. THE THOSE ARE YOU KNOW SOME OPPORTUNITIES WERE KIND OF LOOKING OVER WE'VE ALREADY. YOU KNOW TOUCHED EVERY INDIVIDUAL POSSESS THE PHYSICIAN IN THE COUNTY AND NOW WE'RE LOOKING. TO MAKE SURE WE'VE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD ALL OF THE DOCTORS THAT ARE. PRIVILEGES THAT ARE WORK FOR SO I THINK ALL OF THE APPROACHES- YOU WITNESSES SITUATIONS VERY- LIKE I CAN SAY THAT IT'S OFFICE SCHOOL. OR IT'S ALL CAPACITY THINK IT'S A VARIETY DEPENDING ON. YOU KNOW WHICH PARTICULAR COMMUNITY WERE WERE DISCUSSING AND FILL ALL OF THOSE WILL BE GOOD IF WE COULD FIND SOME WAY TO QUANTIFY REALIZE YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION. BUT I MEAN IT'S- I'M NOT SURE IT IS A MIX THE QUESTIONS HOW MUCH OF A MEAL. EXACTLY WHAT IS THAT MIX RIGHT SIR. AND LIKE I SAID IN SOME COMMUNITIES I THINK THERE THERE ARE A LARGE POPULATIONS OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCT LINES FOR THEM. AND THERE ARE MARKETS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF WHAT. POSITION ARE SERVICING OUR ARE ACTUALLY ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE. BUT THEY ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT SOME MEDICARE ALL. AND YOUR POINT ABOUT THE FISCAL SITUATION- LARGELY THAT THAT MIGHT BE WHY THEY WOULD. NOT BE OPEN TO ALL PLANS LET'S SAY IN A GEOGRAPHIC AS KERR COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE OR- EVEN ONE. OR THE OTHER NOT TO MODEL. AND THAT REALLY IS SOMEWHAT EXTRA. EASIER YOU KNOW THAT IN ONE CASE. AND SO FORTH IDEALISTIC DO WHAT YOU SEE IS THE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF. THAT WELL THE- THE NETWORK ADEQUACY LIKE THAT WE'RE ALL GOOD LAWYERS AND YOU'VE AYE ARE ALL GOOD I'M NOT GUESSING SO. YOU'RE NOT BUT- TERMS OF WITH THE CHALLENGES OF MEETING THOSE STANDARDS AND THE RATES THAT WERE THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE. YEAH CERTAINLY SO OBVIOUSLY OUR GEOGRAPHY PLAYS A BIG ROLE SO THAT IS CHALLENGE IF YOU'RE LOOKING ZIP CODE BY ZIP CODE OF COURSE- YOU KNOW IT AND IN CERTAIN AREAS YOU JUST RUN INTO. JUST A LACK OF PROVIDERS AND- FRANKLY A LOT OF TIMES A LACK OF PEOPLE IN GENERAL SO. OF COURSE THERE IS CHALLENGES JUST BASED ON GEOGRAPHY- WE ALSO DO EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES BASED ON CERTAIN SPECIALTY TYPE AND SO. YOU KNOW TO YOUR PRIOR. COMMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW RACE WE DO OFTEN- I THINK. YOU REFERENCE THE IN THE HEARING THREE YEARS AGO WERE IN THAT BUT WHERE WE WILL OFTEN SORT OF TAILOR OUR RATE BASED ON THAT. THE DEMAND THAT SERVICE AND THE NEED A FAST SERVICE SO. YOU KNOW WE DO FIND OURSELVES PAYING MORE THAN. THE FEE FOR SERVICE RATE OFTENTIMES. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION HIS YOU KNOW WHAT A CHALLENGES. PHYSICIANS WELL WHERE IT'S A FINITE RESOURCE SO. YOU YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE SOME CREATIVE THINGS IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AND GRANT DOLLARS IN TRYING TO DRIVE MEMBERS OUR COMMUNITY BUT WERE OFTEN JUST TAKEN THEM FROM ANOTHER COMMUNITY FOR ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM TO GO SO. IF EVERYONE ACROSS THE STATE'S DOING THAT WERE BASICALLY JUST READ FROM THE SAME PYRITE SO- I DID WANT YOU KNOW AT LEAST NOTE THAT AND THEN ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. YOU KNOW WE DO A GAP ANALYSIS OF OUR NETWORK I THINK YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW COMPARING TO COMMERCIAL NETWORKS AND- THAT WE DON'T OFFER A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT FOR NICE TO MEDI CAL. PLAN SO WE DO TAKE A LOOK OUT THERE AND SEE WHICH DOCTORS ARE IN OTHER NETWORKS THAT AREN'T IN OURS AND HOW DO WE CLOSE THAT GAP AND YOU KNOW IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL CASE BY CASE BASIS. OFTENTIMES ABOUT. HAPPENS BUT WE DO WANT TO AT LEAST- APPROACH THAT. AND HAVE THE MOST ROBUST NETWORK THAT WE CAN AND THEN. YOU KNOW THEY'LL GOING TO MENTION THAT WE DO HAVE A LARGE MEMBERSHIP OR COUNTY SO. YOU KNOW IT JUST. MAKES ARE ABLE TO USE. JUST THAT THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SIZE- TO. HELP US TO NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GET. MEMBERS TO THE DOOR WE HAVE MEMBERS. SO OFTENTIMES ARE ABLE TO SAY HERE YOU CAN GET LEASE CAN SEE MEMBERS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY WELL I THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR- PRESENTATIONS AND FOR THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE YOUNG CONTINUING WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT- EVERYTHING WORKS HERE AND- YOU KNOW YOU PLAY VERY. VITAL ROLE AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR MEDICAL PIECE GET THE CARE THEY NEED SO THANKS FOR MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO THE BRING UP OUR NEXT PANEL WHICH IS OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS CONSUMERS AND I WANT TO WELCOME- KELLY BOMB LEDGE THAT COULD FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS SAY ROMANOWSKI CO WITH THIS ACT SAN FRANCISCO COMMITTEE CLICK CONSORTIUM. WHEN THE- TO NARROW LISTS THAT RIGHT OKAY SENIOR POLICY ADVOCATE TELEPHONE PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK AND- MIKE ODA DIRECTOR OF. HEALTH POLICY CHILDREN NOW WELCOME SO. ASK YOU CAN KEEP YOUR MARKS THE THREE MINUTES AS YOU CAN SEE WE OFTEN HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS SO THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVEN MORE EXPLORATION. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED MEMBERS NUMBER- KELLY BEING OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PHYSICIANS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I WANTED AYE STRAIGHT INTO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS PROVIDE PRESENTED TO ME- ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT PROVIDERS FACE WHEN TRYING TO PARTICIPATE. PARTICIPATE IN MEDI CAL. CALIFORNIA'S HEAVILY DOMINATED BY LARGE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THE STATE ALLOWS FOR DELEGATE ARRANGEMENTS WITHIN THOSE PLANS. AND THIS IS WHERE IT IS MORE CHALLENGING PROVIDERS TO SEE REFER AND COURTNEY CARE FOR THEIR PATIENTS. IF A PATIENT NEEDS A SPECIALTY REFERRAL THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE IN THE MEDICAL GROUPS NETWORK. THE PRIMARY DOCTOR MAY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE REFERRING TO SOMEONE THAT THEY KNOW A SPECIALS THAT IS KNOWN TO THEM. BUT THAT'S SPECIALIST MAY OR MAY NOT BE PART OF PLAN OR THE GROUPS NETWORK. IF A PATIENT DOES SEE ESPECIALLY PROVIDER OUTSIDE OF THAT IT'S HARDER FOR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR GET FULL OF. FROM THAT AS IS PLANS TO. OVERSEEING THE OF PATIENTS AND SERVING AS A COORDINATED ENTITY THIS RESPONSIBILITY MAY BE DELEGATED TO LARGE MEDICAL GROUPS OR IPA. IN TURN THOSE MEDICAL GROUPS RIGHT PEAS MAY ONLY COORDINATE PATIENT CARE UP TO THEIR FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. THE PHYSICIANS I'VE TALKED TO CALL THIS PING PONG ANG WHERE THE PLANET DELEGATED ENTITY OR INTERPRETING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES DIFFERENTLY. SOMEONE AND HE MAY END UP TO NINE THE SERVICER PAYMENT STATING THE OTHER IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE. DEPENDING ON THIS RESPONSIBILITY THE MEDICAL GROUP MAY ONLY BE AT RISK FOR PRIMARY CARE AND LAB DIAGNOSTICS. THEY WILL HAPPILY COURTNEY THOSE PATIENTS UP TO THAT MEETING- SERVICES BUT AS SOON AS THEY NEEDS SPECIALTY CONSULTAR DME SO MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. THE PATIENT GETS TO FIGURE OUT ON THEIR OWN AND THEY DO THEIR BEST TO HELP BUT IT ONLY I MEAN THEY CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH SOMETIMES. ESSENTIALLY THE CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PLAN AND THE MEDICAL GROUP DICTATES THE PARAMETERS OF THE PATIENT CARE COORDINATION. WHAT MEDICARE MANAGED CARE NEEDS IS SIMPLICITY MECHANICS OF HOW IT WORKS AS THE PATIENTS WITHIN MANAGED CARE COMPLICATED ENOUGH WITHOUT THE PLANS DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY ACROSS MULTIPLE LAYERS OF ADMINISTRATION. THIS PUTS ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITY BETWEEN WHAT SHOULD BE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PHYSICIAN THE MEDIC HOW MANAGED CARE PLAN AND THE PATIENT. LASTLY THE MEDICAL POPULATION IS INCREDIBLY DIVERSE THEIR CHALLENGES THAT ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT A PREDOMINANT THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET. LOW INCOME HOUSING INSTABILITY LANGUAGE OR EDUCATIONAL BARRIERS. AND HEALTH ISSUES OR PHYSICAL DISABILITIES THESE FACTORS MAKE SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING CARE MORE DIFFICULT YET MORE IMPORTANT AT THE SAME TIME AND HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO CUT OUT UNNECESSARY. UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY IN THE SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA PHYSICIAN STAND READY TO SUPPORT THE KELLY MINISTRY OF AS IT IS SETTING A NEW COURSE AND IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION INCREASING THE COORDINATION OF CARE. BUT IT NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD UNDERSTANDING AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CURRENT COMPLEXITY CHALLENGES PHYSICIANS FACE AND CERVANTES PATIENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I'M SUMMER METHOXY THE CEO OF THE SAN FRANCISCO COMMUNITY CLINIC CONSORTIUM WE REPRESENT ABOUT A HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND PATIENTS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOODS WE ARE ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM TO COORDINATE CARE AT THE LOCAL REGIONAL STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL- TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST VLNERABLE COMMUNITIES. TODAY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS SERVE ONE IN THREE MEDICARE PATIENTS AND PROVIDE MORE THAN 50% OF THE MEDICARE OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTERS WE BEGAN MEETING WITH UCS STAFF TO DISCUSS OUR THOUGHTS ON HOW TO IMPROVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE MEDICAL SYSTEM AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE SOME OF THOSE THOUGHTS TODAY. IN TERMS OF MODELS OF CARE OF RECENT STATE AUDIT REPORT FOUND THAT THE REGIONAL MODEL FOR ROLE EXPANSION AS UNDER PERFORMING OR REGIONAL HEALTH CENTERS ARE REQUESTING THAT THE PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN MODEL BE ENCOURAGED TO EXPAND TO COVER THE ENTIRE REGION OUR HEALTH CENTERS IN BOTH CRIMINAL AND SAN DIEGO STATED THEY WANT TO IMPROVE THE GEOGRAPHIC MAJOR MODEL BUT IT WILL NOT WANT TO SEE THE MODEL JETTISONED AT THIS TIME. IN TERMS OF ENCOUNTER DATA. IN A CAPITATED ENVIRONMENT AND CANDIDATE IS THE KEY TO ALL PARTIES UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS AND SERVICES FOR THE MEDICARE PATIENT STARTING WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN THE PROVIDER'S OFFICE THE DATA TRAVELS THROUGH MULTIPLE PARTIES INCLUDING EYE PEAS M. ESOS CLEARING HOUSES IT CETERA YOU MAY EDIT THE DATA- OR HAVE SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS THAT ALTER INFORMATION AS IT FLOWS THROUGH THEIR SYSTEM. ULTIMATELY RESULTING IN AND- AND CORRECTOR ON INCOMPLETE DATA THAT ALTMAN THEIR PARTY TO THE STATE OR THE PLAN. WE ARE ASKING THAT PROVIDERS THEREFORE GET TIMELY REGULAR REPORTS ON DATA THAT IS ALTMAN ACCEPTED BY THE PLAN IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS ALONG THE TRANSMISSION PROCESS. ALL PLAN SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DIRECTLY PROCESS TO SUPPLEMENT A FILE THAT BYPASSES SOME OF THESE INTERVENING AUTOMATED PROCESS SEES FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES TO THE WE CAN IDENTIFY GLITCHES IN THE SYSTEM. ALSO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER SHOULD GET DATA BACK ON UTILIZATION COSTS. FOR THE ENTIRE COST OF CARE WITHIN THE SYSTEM BEFORE TO TRULY BE A PARTNER IN REDUCING OVERALL COSTS. FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT THERE ARE NUMBER OF BEST PRACTICES THAT- WE LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONE IS HAVING REAL TIME SELF SERVICE PORTALS FOR OUR PROVIDERS BUT THEY KEEP AND INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENTS GAPS IN CARE THERE HE DOES NEED. OF WHAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES IS THAT THE PLANTS DON'T PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION UNTIL THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE YEAR. PROVIDING THESE MASSIVE LISTS AND THEN THAT LAST MINUTE INCENTIVES. TO TRY AND TRACK DOWN THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS WHICH IS REALLY NOT AN EFFECTIVE WAY FOR US TO SERVE. ON ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE A HEALTH PLAN SUBCONTRACT WITH OTHER AGENCIES. WHERE A LAB RESULTS DON'T COME BACK IN A IN A WAY THEY CAN BE INGESTED INTO AN EHR THEY COME BACK AND HAVE TO BE MANUALLY RE ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM. WHICH FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER THAT'S ALREADY SHORT ON STAFF THIS IS AN EFFICIENT ANNA DELAYS ACCESS TO NEEDED INFORMATION. WE ALSO LIKE A ON THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN Q. RIGHT COMMUNITIES TO BUILD Q. I PROGRAMS. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEY REALLY MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY- WE ALSO WOULD WANT TO SEE HEALTH PLANS HAVE LOCAL STAFF AND PRACTICE TRANSFORMATION COACHES IT CAN WORK IN AREAS. THAT WE SERVE THANK YOU. DOCTOR PAN AND SENATOR LEAVE A- MY NAME IS LINDA TO NARROW ITS NUMBER SENIOR POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK. WE ARE IS STATEWIDE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG CALIFORNIA'S UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WE APPRECIATE THE INVITATION TO BE HERE TODAY AND SHED LIGHT ON THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE. WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND PROVIDE SOME SOLUTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHANGE AND IMPROVEMENT. DESPITE GAINES HAD IN THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS AND ROLLED INTO HEALTH CARE. DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES CONTINUE TO EXIST FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND MEDI CAL. OVER THE PAST YEAR THE PEN CONDUCTED A NUMBER OF FOCUS GROUPS. ACROSS THE STATE WITH THE GOAL TO ENGAGE DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS AND CONSUMERS IN MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE. ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN ACCESSING CARE AN IMPASSE ON THEIR WELL BEING. OUR FOCUS GROUP FINDINGS AND COMMUNITY STORIES HIGHLIGHT STARK DISPARITIES. AND THE MENTAL BARRIERS IN ACCESSING CARE. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED HAVING LONG WAIT TIMES BOTH FOR APPOINTMENTS AND AT THE FACILITIES THEMSELVES. THEY ALSO REPORT A LACK OF ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE AND MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS ESPECIAL ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS IS ALSO CONCERNING ONE OF OUR FRESNO PARTICIPANTS FOR EXAMPLE WHO IDENTIFIES AS LOT NEXT FINDS IT CHALLENGING TO ARRANGE TRANSPORTATION TO MAKE THEIR APPOINTMENTS. THE OFTEN GET ASKED FOR RIGHTS FROM ELDER LEAVE MAKES THAT GOAL- COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE UNABLE OR FREE TO DRIVE- OUT OF FEAR OF GETTING PULLED OVER THE POLICE. WE'VE SEEN A GREAT LACK OF AFFIRMATION OF LANGUAGE RIGHTS AND INTERPRETATION SERVICES. TO PARTICIPANTS WHO IDENTIFIED AS API AND LET NEXT WERE NOT INFORMED OF THEIR RIGHTS TO AN INTERPRETER OR OFFERED THE ASSISTANCE WHEN THERE WAS A CLEAR NEED. IN THE TIMES THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN ENTER SERVICES THE QUALITY WAS INCONSISTENT AT FAST. WE KNOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL CARE COMPREHENSION AND INTERPRETATION IS ESSENTIAL. LANGUAGE AFFIRMING SERVICES BUILDS TRUST BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS AND THIS OFTEN GOES MISSING. FOR PATIENT ENGAGEMENT INCLUDING IN ADEQUATE EXPLANATIONS ABOUT MEDICATION MEDICAL PROCEDURES OR HOME CARE INSTRUCTIONS HAVE LEFT PEOPLE FEELING RUSHED TO MAKE DECISIONS OR BOMBARDED WITH PAPERWORK. ADDITIONALLY PROVIDER STIGMA OR JUST RESPECTFUL TREATMENT BASED ON A PERSON'S LANGUAGE RACE SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY DISABILITY STATUS OR SIZE AND WEIGHT IS ALSO HARMFUL. AN AFRICAN AMERICAN PARTICIPANT WHO HAD COME IN WITH THAT DOWN ABDOMINAL PAIN DUE TO GASTRITIS WAS ASSUME TO BE ON OUR CAUGHT IT. ANOTHER DISABLED PARTICIPANTS DOCTOR WAS ASTOUNDED THAT THEY HAD ASKED FOR AN S. T. D. TASK BECAUSE THEY HAD ASSUME THAT THEIR PATIENT COULD NOT BE SEXUALLY ACTIVE. SEVERAL FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND PURE ADVOCATES CAN PLAY IN HELPING INDIVIDUALS UNDERSTAND THEIR CARE INSTRUCTIONS WHILE ALSO COMBATING DISCRIMINATION AND HARMFUL STEREOTYPES. THESE ARE JUST A HANDFUL OF STORIES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AS A RESULT OF OUR FOCUS GROUP FINDINGS HOWEVER PLENTY MORE EXIST AROUND THE STATE AND CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH FINDING. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. HOWEVER WE SEE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE TO EXECUTE ENFORCEMENT AND ALSO TAKE THE LEAD ON IMPROVING QUALITY AND ACCESS. THE CAL AND PROPOSAL- SEEKS TO TRANSFER NEW RESPONSIBILITIES TO MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT PACKAGE. AND I'M SORRY- WRAP UP- AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES- WE THINK IN GENERAL THAT THE STATE CAN REALLY TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT PLANTS ARE DOING TO REACH IS. VERY BASIC EXISTING REQUIREMENTS BEFORE- TASKING PLANTS WITH MORE RESPONSIBILITIES- WEEPING FOR INCENTIVES CAN BE PROVIDED TO REACHING THOSE GOALS- AND MORE INFORMATION- CAN BE PROVIDED ON OUR WEBSITE. THANK YOU. A OFFICIALS OF VEGETABLE GARDEN YOU SHOULD THE FOCUS GROUP YEAH WE LET THE IT LITERALLY JUST WENT LIVE TODAY SO WE JUST FINISHED OUR MANY BRIEF SO WE ARE HAPPY TO. SO ENCOURAGE IT WOULD CERTAINLY IF UP THE DARK COMMITTEE AND ALSO WITH THE FARM IF YOU HAVE THAT DONE SO. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHAEL DAY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH POLICY CHILDREN NOW WE'RESTATEWIDE MULTI ISSUE CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. AS WE POINTED OUT IN OUR NEWLY RELEASED- TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA TROLLS REPORT CARD KIDS ACROSS THE STATE ARE NOT GETTING THE HEALTH SERVICES THEY NEED TO FIND A LEGAL GUARANTEE. I KNOW THIS IS A NEW TO THE COMMITTEE WITH THE I WAS MENTIONED EARLIER- BUT THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE ALSO RELEASED REPORT LAST YEAR SHOWING THAT CALIFORNIA WAS IN FIFTH PLACE IN TERMS OF. WELL BABY SCREENING. SO THIS PUTS OUR KIDS AT RISK ACROSS YOUR YOUNGEST KIDS AND UNDERMINES OUR PRESENCE WE MADE AN EARLY CHILDHOOD. UNDER THEIR MEDICAL pCONTRACTS HEALTH PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE CHILDREN WITH THE REGULAR SCHEDULE PREVENTIVE SERVICES INCLUDING WELL CHILD VISITS SCREENINGS VACCINATIONS. AS WELL AS TREATMENT THEY TELL ME NEED- IN COORDINATION WITH CARVED OUT SERVICES LIKE DENTAL CARE. IN EXCHANGE TEACH YES WHICH OVERSEES AND ENFORCES THOSE CONTRACTS PAYS A MONTHLY PAYMENT WHETHER OR NOT THE SERVICES ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDED. SO WHAT THE CONTRACT AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS ARE COMPLEX AND OPAQUE THE OUTCOMES WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST DECADE FOR KIDS ARE PROBLEMATIC. BUT THE SOLUTION IS CLEAR WE MUST CHANGE THE RULES AND BEGIN PAYING HEALTH PLANS BASED ON QUALITY AND RESULTS. AS THE ADMINISTRATION WORKS TO REDESIGN MANAGED CARE CONTRACTING AND PROCUREMENT EACH YES SHOULD RESTRUCTURE THE MEDICAL PAYMENTS FOR CHILDREN SERVICES. ENSURE DELIVERY PREVENTIVE CARE. TO SUPPORT CARE COORDINATION. AND TO REWARD PLANS FOR IMPROVEMENTS INSURANCE ALL OUTCOMES WHILE ALSO STEP. IN CONSEQUENCE FOR FIFTH YEAR. FIRST THE BASE MEDICAL CARE PORTION OF THE PAYMENT SHOULD REQUIRE A MINIMUM SPEND THE MINIMUM PRIMARY CARE SPAN. FOR PEDIATRIC PRIMARY. AFTER PREVENTIVE CARE. SO PLANS THAT DO NOT MEET THIS MINIMUM LEVEL OF SPENDING ON CHILDREN'S PRIMARY CARE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REPEAT THAT THOSE SOME FUNDS BACK TO THE STATE. AT SOME. I FELT. REALLY THE RATE INCLUDING. FOR CARE COORDINATION. TIED TO. METRICS THAT MEET THE AND BEFORE THE NEEDS OF ALL CHILDREN JUST THE PERCENT KIDS WHO. HAVE THE MOST INTENSIVE AND EXPENSIVE NEEDS. AND FINALLY A PAYMENT STRUCTURE SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR DEMONSTRATING YEAR OVER YEAR PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT IN AREAS LIKE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS. CLOSELY PREFER ALL RATES REDUCTIONS IN RACIAL ETHNIC DISPARITIES AND INVESTMENT IN SIR SOCIAL SERVICE SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. THESE REFORMS ARE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE VALUE QUALITY IN EQUITY THE VERY GOALS THAT TEACH CS IS LAID OUT ITS QUALITY STRATEGY. SO IF WE SAY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PLANS TO PROVIDE QUALITY CARE AND IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR KIDS IN THE WAY IN WHICH TO PAY PLAN SORT OF. THOSE PRIORITIES LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE DEPARTMENT- TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL CHILDREN RECEIVE AND THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. THANKS OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS QUESTIONS YES SIR LEYVA. AND OF UP TO SPEED NOW. THANK YOU. SENATOR PAN THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT PRESENTATIONS VERY HELPFUL. I HAD A QUESTION- FOR KELLY. KELLY IS A BONE. GAME SORRY ABOUT THE THAT'S EASY TO REMEMBER THANK YOU FOR. YOU TALKED ABOUT- CUTTING OUT THE UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY IN THE SYSTEM I COULDN'T AGREE MORE ANY IDEAS ON HOW WE DO THAT YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO MAP THE DELEGATE IN NETWORKS TO KNOW THAT THE NETWORKS ARE ACCURATE AND IT'S NOT JUST I WOULD SAY. LIKE A CRUTCH THAT THE PLANS ARE ABLE TO CONTRACT WITH THE DELEGATED ENTITY VERSUS OTHERS BECAUSE AND WE'RE CONVENIENCE IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OTHER UNDERNEATH I THINK THAT THAT I WOULD GO A LONG WAY IN INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AND AT LEAST- CREATING A MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM GOOD SO IF THEY DO EXIST WE SHOULD JUST KNOW HOW HOW THEIR EXISTING. GOT IT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE YES THINK THE OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. AT SOME OF THE SITE PIECE HALF BECAUSE DELAYS CARE INCREASE. YOUR SET TO. I MAY NOT BE OP. THAT THE NETWORK IS ADEQUATE BUT THE ABILITY TO GET THOSE REFERRALS MAY BE CONSTRAINED THROUGH OTHER PROCESSES. OKAY YEAH I CAN AGREE WITH YOU MORE THAT I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU. I'M GONNA SAY THIS WRONG BUT YOU SAID THAT THE LAB RESULTS ARE NOT COMING BACK. IN EITHER A USABLE READABLE FORM. WHO DO YOU NOT HAVE THE EQUIPMENT I HAVE WE NOT EQUIPPED YOU WITH WHAT YOU NEED OR THE LABS NOT SENDING IT BACK TO YOU IN THE- CORRECT FORM. SO IN A DELEGATED ARRANGEMENT AT A PUBLIC HOSPITALS DOING ON THE LAB WORK IN THEM THAT INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL DOESN'T COME BACK TO THE HOUSE CENTERS. IN A WAY THAT CAN BE INGESTED INTO THEIR EHR. SO SOMEONE HAS TO SIT THERE AND RE ENTER THAT INFORMATION AT THE PRIMARY CARE AND- THAT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE NO I TOTALLY AGREE SO HOW WOULD WE FIX THAT- I JUST THINK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE DELEGATED OF. MEN'S REALLY ASKING SOME OF THE- THE SECOND. QUESTIONS THE THERE ARE THREE. I PUT. HOW LAB. MISSION IS TRANCE. BACK WOULD REALLY HELPFUL YEP I THINK THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY EASY FIXABLE THING YES I WOULD SAY THAT SEEM IS LOOKING AT SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THE GOVERNOR POSTED UNDER THE NEW- I THINK CENTER FOR INNOVATION. AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE INTEGRATION OF EHRS AND YOU KNOW MAKING THE SYSTEMS MORE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE SO. THAT SOUNDS CAN PROVIDE YOUR OFFICE WITH MORE INFORMATION I'LL BE GREAT THAT BE VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU- SO I COULD BE JUST THE- SORT OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND- THAT'S WHY IS HE STILL TABLE HERE SO WE TALKED ABOUT. THAT OVERSIGHT OVER THE DELEGATED MODEL APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ASK THEM TO ALSO CERTIFIED OR NETWORK ADEQUACY- TO WHAT DEGRE E. ARE YOU. GOING TO ALSO- FOR EXAMPLE SHOULD THEY- SHOULD ARE YOU EXPECT THEM TO FOR EXAMPLE SHARE THE CONTRACT THEY HAVE THE DELEGATED ENTITY SO YOU KNOW WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS WERE SO. WE ARE DEVELOPING PINING. SO THAT THE- IF YOU GET COMPLAINTS ARE THERE ARE PORTERS. IF YOU SEE ACCESS PROBLEMS. AT THAT. THERE'S POSTED A IF THERE'S A DISPUTE BETWEEN V. DELEGATE MODEL ON THE PLANET TECHNICALLY OF COURSE YOU HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE PLANS OF THE PLAN. YES BUT- IN TERMS OF HELPING RESOLVE THOSE THINGS OR- BE ABLE TO. TO AS AN AGENCY. BE SURE OF THE- THAT THEY IS RAPID RESOLUTION AS THESE TYPES OF DISPUTE SO YOU KNOW HOW PROVIDERS AND ULTIMATELY SPENT OFFICIERS GETTING CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE AGENCY MIGHT THINK ABOUT. DOING IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT OVER DELEGATED- ENTITIES. TO HELP. PRESERVE THE RESOLVER OR- PREVENT THESE ISSUES MAPPING SO I THINK THE DEPARTMENT IS STILL LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE YOU ARE CORRECT WE ONLY CONTRACT WITH THEM THE PRIME PLAN RIGHTS ON THE ERM THAT WE USE- BUT WE DO HAVE WE ISSUED- AND ALL PLAN LETTER TO ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS IN REGARDS TO. OUR EXPECTATIONS IF THEY ARE GOING TO DELEGATE NOT ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS DELEGATE ON TO THE DEGREE IN WHICH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY BUT THERE ARE POCKETS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF DELEGATION JUST TO BE CLEAR AND FAIR TO THE CONVERSATION AND SO. ON THERE IS A THERE IS A LETTER WE DO LAY OUT OUR EXPECTATIONS WE DO EXPECT THAT ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS THAT THEY ARE DELEGATING TO THE INTO BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS- THAT THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MEETING ALL OF. THE DEPARTMENTS EXPECTATIONS SO WHATEVER OUR CONTRACT WITHIN THOSE PARAMETERS- DELEGATING THAT. ENTITY IS RESPONSIBLE COMMUTER EXPECTED IN THE MANAGED CARE PLAN IS RESPONSIBLE TO AUDIT AND OVERSEE THAT INDIVIDUAL AND SEE. UP THE LAST YEAR'S BEEN TIGHTENING UP THERE SO ARE OP. FOR US TO LOOK AT IT CLEARLY OUR OPTIONS MOVING FORWARD IN REGARDS TO THE DELEGATED I'M A NETWORK ADEQUACYOCCASIONS. WE'LL BE LOOKING AT OTHER TO NEEDS IN REGARDS TO OVERSIGHT- BOUNCED TEAM- AS- I. USED AND TENCHI THREE. PROCESS OF WAYS IT MADE. TIED UP. IN THOSE. CONTRACT WILL RELATE. CONTRACT CLING OUR CALL BACK DOOR INSTEAD. TO MAKE SURE THAT IS CLEAR. OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF THOSE DALY INTO. OKAY. AT THE END OF THE DAY THE ANSWER FOR ALL SO THERE'S A CAR. OF WHO RESPONSE FOR THE PAY. OF IN THAT PROVIDE NEEDS TO PAID AND SO. YOU KNOW OUR RESPONSE RELIGIOUS SAY THE PLAN YOU ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT PROVIDER GETTING PAID. REGARDLESS YOU KNOW WHETHER FIGHTING OVER THE DOUGH FOR THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AT CETERA. IN TERMS OF THE ISSUE PRIOR ALSO. THE DELEGATED ENTITIES ARE HELD TO THE SAME STATE LAW THE PLANS ARE ALL TOO. YOU KNOW WHICH IS FIVE DAY PERIOD DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU CAN DO AN EXTENSION WITH NOTIFICATION TO THE MEMBER. SO YOU KNOW IT'S THE PLANT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THAT THOSE DELEGATED ENTITIES ARE. PERFORMING THEIR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FUNCTION AND IN THE EXACT SAME TIME FRAME. AND TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE REVIEWING YOU KNOW DIALS SO THAT IS PART OF THEIR OVERSIGHT PROCESS. TO ENSURE THE NILES OR IF THERE ARE A NILES THAT THEY'RE BEING DONE APPROPRIATELY. SO I THEY YOU. TO SEIZE POINT I MEAN IT'S OUR JOB TO ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE THE PLANS UNDERSTAND AND THEY DO. THERE OWN. RESPONSIBLE DON'T DISAGREE THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE TING TING IN OVER THE- OF FNANCE RESPONSE COP BUT SO. YOU KNOW THEY GOAL OF THIS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I MEAN. YOU KNOW USE USE THE COURSE OF. THE CITY. REGIS PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING PAID. REMEMBER TO NOT GET THE CARE THEY BECAUSE THERE AN APPROACH AND I'LL WHICH- I MEAN TO BE. THE REFERENCE TO EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS WERE THE THAT WAS ONE OF THE CORE PROBLEMS. OUT IN A GUESS WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT. INSANELY TRACY TO PATIENT OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE THE SPEEDS WE SHOULD KEEP FIGHTER OUT IN THE MIDDLE TO SPEEDS AND- I KNOW YOU MADE REFERENCE ALSO THE DMA SEE INSIDE THEY HAVE A ROLE IN REGULATING PLANS BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THE- CAL PROGRAM. I HOPE IS THAT- THAT THE AGENCY WOULD HOLD PLAN RESPONSIBLE FOR BEING SURE THAT PROVIDERS FOR SO I GET TIMELY PAYMENTS OF DOING A PING PONG THAT PLAN CAN PAYS A- PROVIDER THEN AND THEN COLLECT IF THEY FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT. THEIR RESPONSIBILITY COLLECT FROM THE DELEGATE AND ANY LIKE THE TWO OF THEM CAN CONTINUE MY KEEP BATTLING IT OUT THE BELL OUT EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO THE CONTRACT WITH EACH OTHER SO. POSITION YET. THREATEN TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACT TO FIGURE OUT WHO ENDS UP HOLE YOU KNOW WHO AND WHERE THE MONEY. FOR THE MONEY EVENTUALLY TO AND THEN THE OTHER PART IS IN TERMS OF THE PRIOR OFF AND SO FORTH. IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING IT'S ABOUT PRIOR OTT'S FROM PHYSICIANS FOR MEDI CL FOR. OUR NOSES OTHER PROVIDERS THAT. BASICALLY THAT THE PLAN GETS PENALIZED. IF THE I. T. A. IS. DOING SOMETHING AND THAT IT'S UP FOR THE PLAN TO THEN FIGURE OUT HOW THEY IN THEIR CONTRACT WITH THE I. P. EIGHTY OR WHATEVER DOWN AGAIN ENTITIES AND- VIBER PROJECT VISION THEY HAVE TO COLLECT THAT PENALTY BACK OF THEY FEEL IT'S REALLY NOT THEIR RESPONSIBLY AGAIN BECAUSE YOUR CONTRACT WITH. THE PLAN BUT WHY DON'T WANT TO DO IS HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE CLINIC IS SITTING THERE HITTING AT THAT YOU KNOW BEING YOUNG THE THERE'S A VIOLATION OF THE LAW ARE THERE. NOW WITH A SICKLY NOT RESPONDING- AND THE ONLY RECOURSE THEY HAVE IS ACTUALLY TO. AGAIN FIGHT WITH THE IT'S WHETHER IT'S THE- DELEGATE ANY OR THE PLAN. AND BASICALLY STARTS THERE'S STILL NOT GETTING PAID THAT- THAT AGAIN DOWN THE PLAN OF THE PLAN TO DEL AGAIN ANY CAN BATTLE IT OUT BUT- THE- BUT- BASICALLY. THEIR X. WITH THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE EXPECTED IF THEY DON'T GET THE FIRE OFF IN THE FIVE DAYS AND IT'S AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZED AND- THEY DON'T MAKE IT. GEN AND BOOM SORRY THE PLANS PAYING FOR THE PLAN CAN COLLECT FROM DELEGATE ENTITY. THAT EITHER THAT MAKE A DECISION. RIGHT SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO KEEP THAT THE PROVIDERS OUT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THESE TWO AND THE- AND ULTIMATELY OF COURSE MOST IMPORTANTLY THE BENEFICIARY THE PATIENT TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T NEED TO HAVE A LOOK. CARE I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY WANT SURE IT HAPPENS THE END. A QUICK. THING OUT SO I WILL SAY THE- PHYSICIANS. SPECIALISTS ARE YOU A LOT MORE. WHEN THEY TO GO. WITH THE MANAGED CARE. OR W. AS THE I THINK. THEY ARE ABLE TO SAY THERE AND THEY- SAY WELL FOR THIS CERTAIN PROCEDURE IN ADDITION TO THE RATE I'M ALSO GOING TO NEGOTIATE I GET TO FOLLOW UPS THAT ARE INCLUDED I DON'T HAVE TO ASK FOR PAR OFF- AND SO I THINK THAT THEY'RE GETTING MORE SO. COULD IN THAT REGARD IN THAT BETTER SERVES XIN AND THEIR- BETTER ABLE TO. CREATE EFFICIENCY IN THEIR PRACTICE BUT THEN ALSO TIMELY AS FOR THE PATIENT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT AUTHORIZATION FOR THIS THIRD. BUT THIS MESSAGE. COMMENTED SOMETIMES WHAT. WITH PHYSICAL THIRD IS YOUNG SOME HAS A SIR. THAT BURKE. A CONSIST PHYSICAL THERAPY. AND THEY'LL BE TWO VISITS ARE THREE VISITS AND SO AUTHORIZED THAT TIMELY. BUT THEN YOU WAIT ANOTHER FIVE DAYS AND THEN BY THE TIME YOU CAN'T GET INTO THE PHYSICAL THERAPIES OFFICE. IT WAS ANOTHER WEEK SO YOU'VE GOT CARE GAPPING CARE CARE GAPPING CARE. BECAUSE OF THE WAY SOME OF THESE PRIOR AUST PARTICULAR FOR THINGS LIKE THERAPY AND OF HAPPENING. ON IT'S JUST A BUILT IN DELAY. THAT SLOWS DOWN THE PROGRESS OF A PATIENT'S CARE. SO IT'S OF YEN MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OVERSIGHT- AND- DEL CERTAINLY. NOW I THINK THEY'LL GET MODEL HAS ITS PLACE IN MEDI CAL SO NOT OPPOSED TO DELEGATE MODEL BUT- THE STATE DELEGATE. DELEGATION SHOULD NOT THEN RESULT IN MORE OVERHEAD PAPERWORK FOR PROVIDERS ARE BEEN. OF RESULT OF THAT THEY SHOULD THE STANDARD SHOULDN'T CHANGE THE INTERFACE WITH THE FIGHTER SO- THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE SO ACTUALLY IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO CARE ONE THE ISSUES I KNOW THAT'S COME UP IS AN INTERPRETER SERVICES RIGHT SO WELL WE'VE- ALL SPEAKING NUMEROUS LANGUAGES- LIVE EXPERIENCES MYSELF AS A MEDICAL PROVIDER AND- IT. GIVE IF PATIENTS SHOW UP AND BE ABLE TO GET TIMELY INTERPRETER SERVICES UNFORTUNATELY ITIS IT HAS SITUATION WHERE BASICALLY PLAN SAID WHILE THE PATIENT ACTUALLY HAD TO SCHEDULE WITH THE INTERPRETER WITH THE PLAN WE COULDN'T DO IT OF COURSE NOW THAT THE PATIENT WHO DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED INTERPRETER TO FAMILY- LA IS. THEIR INTERFACING WITH SOMEWHAT THE PLAN WHO DOESN'T NECESSARILY SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OR THE NEXT USE ANOTHER TERM FOR SERVICE TO TALK TO THE PLAN PERSON TO STUDENTS SCHEDULED INTERPRETER. ENOUGH DAYS IN ADVANCE TO DENSE HOPEFULLY SHOWS OF THE CLINIC AT THE RIGHT TIME SO WE CAN ACTUALLY OF AN INTERPRETER AND THEY ACTUALLY AND WHEN WE GOT THE WRONG PERSON WE'LL TRY CALLING THE CLINICS AND CLINIC. AND THEY SAID WELL YOU'RE THE CLINIC YOU CAN'T SCHEDULE INTERPRETER ONLY THE PATIENT CAN PART OF PATIENTS FAMILY CAN SCHEDULE INTERPRETER. SO THAT BASICALLY CAME ALMOST WASTED VISIT BECAUSE THE PATIENT WAS THERE I AM FORTY DIDN'T SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE. THE ONLY COULD SPEAK LIMITED NUMBER LANGUAGES AND- AND SO- WHAT CAN WE DO SO ANYWAY AND- DO YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT AXIS INTERPRETER SERVICES. YEAH I MEAN THIS IS JUST BEEN A CONTINUED PATTERN ON THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THERE IS A AN ADEQUATE- WORK FORCE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THESE- INTERPRETATION SERVICES THAT ARE SO CRITICAL AND SO TIMELY- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TAT ARE ALL. ARE OF HIGH QUALITY- AND YOU KNOW HOW THE- THE VERNACULAR AND NECESSARY TO COMMUNICATE IS VERY COMPLEX MEDICAL TERMINOLOGIES- CITY CENTER WE CAN KIND OF BOOST UP YOU KNOW THE- WORK FORCE IN AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS YOU KNOW. FOR ONE THE INTERPRETATION PHONE LINES ARE ALSO THERE SOMEONE THERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IN A TIMELY BASIS- ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET THAT CAN ACTIVITY IN REAL. IS SO I GUESS. FROM MY EXPERIENCE JERRY THIS IS LOW ANECDOTAL BUT I MEAN I THINK THAT THE REASON WE SEXY CENTERS NOT TRANSLATE THERE'S IS ACTUALLY YOU DON'T. NEED IT'S NOT A DIRECT TRANSLATION OF WHAT THE PERSON SAID UNION INTERPRETER WHO CAN CONVEY NOT ONLY THE WORKERS BUT ALSO THE TONE THE BODY LANGUAGE AND SO FORTH SO YOU CAN. BUT ULTIMATELY. SO WHEN WE FIGURE OUT SO BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT ACTON. NETWORK ADEQUACY AND RATE SETTING THIS SECTION. SO OBVIOUSLY NOT WELL SO THAT SO IN TERMS OF MEDICAL INTERPRETERS HOW DO WE- DOES THAT FACTOR IN IN TERMS OF. THE PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE THEM CORRECT SO. SO HOW DO WE SEE WHEN WE DO RATE SETTING AND NETWORK ADEQUACY DO WE HAVE STANDARDS AROUND THOSE LEVEL OF INTERPRETING THAT'S- THAT. THAT TO BAILABLE TO. AND IT. WAS BELT IN THE- I MEAN THERE'S A NEW CLASS BECAUSE THEY NEED BE PAID THEY SHOULD BE PAID. CONTINUE TO LOOK INTO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE EASY ACCESS TO INTERPRETATION SERVICES BUT YES IT IS BUILT INTO THE TO THE MANAGED CARE PLAN MAKE ON THE ADMIN COMPONENT OKAY AND I APPRECIATE TO GO. ALSO IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO THE INTER- SO. AND THIS RECOGNIZING THAT- WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS PUT THE BURDEN ON THE PATIENT. TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HARD TO PATIENTS FAIL THE I. T. CARE KIDS OF. TO THE FAMILY TO HAVE TO SCHEDULE THESE THINGS. WHEN THEY HAVE A LANGUAGE BERIA STARTLE HAS WHICH IS WHY WE NEED INTERPRETER FIRST PLACE- YES. I WOULD ALSO JUST ADD TO THE MPORTANCE OF INTERPRETERS IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE- THAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST. CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ENSURING THAT YOU KNOW INFORMATION IS BEING SHARED AND YOU KNOW VERY SEAMLESSLY- WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN. HARMED BY YOU KNOW RECEIVING MENTAL HEALTH CARE FROM SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE LINGUISTIC- SKILLS OR ON CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND THEN THAT PATIENT IS KIND OF FURTHER TRAUMATIZE AND DOESN'T WANT TO COME BACK. TO SEE A PROVIDER SO- ENSURING THAT WERE- BE SURE WE HAVE CULTURAL COMPETENCE- IN IN LINE WITH OUR OUR- INTERPRETING. INTERPRETATION IS IMPORTANT AS WELL. OKAY ALL RIGHT AND THEN I KNOW- TODAY YOU HAD SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF- THE ISSUES AROUND THE- FEATURE WEAKENED UPPER PERFORMANCE AROUND THE CHILDREN GETTING THEIR SCREENING AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES- INTO WHETHER ANY ANY THOUGHTS FROM THE FARM ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS HE BROUGHT UP I MEAN I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT SOME IT EARLIER BUT AND THAT MEANS THAT IN TERMS OF EXPLORING- DIFFERENT IDEAS TO. I THINK YOU TALKED ABOUT A SET A SET ASIDE OR SOME AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT THEN WOULD BE IF THEY DON'T FORM THAT WOULD BE. SO CHORE SO IT'S A IT'S A COMPLEX QUESTION FIRST ANSWER TODAY AND THINK THE DEPARTMENT IS CONSTANTLY LOOKING AND I THINK A BRIDE MENTIONED EARLIER DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN INCENTIVIZE OUR PLANS NOT JUST YOU KNOW THE SANCTIONS AND CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS WHICH ARE VERY NECESSARY SOMETIMES BUT WE ARE THINKING THROUGH A VARIETY OF WAYS IN THE FUTURE TO THINK ABOUT RATE SETTING- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PIECES WE HAVE TO CONTEMPLATE FOR THOSE TYPES OF DECISIONS. YEAH FULL DISCLOSURE MY AND I HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE I BECAME THE DIRECTOR. OF THIS. SO I THINK. I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS OF IN ONE IS WE'VE GOT TO SIMPLIFY THE CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE THE CURRENT RATE STRUCTURES INCREDIBLY COMPLEX WITH THOUSANDS OF RATE CELLS. I THINK WE'VE GOT TO GET TO A PLACE FOR. PAYING PLANS FOR THE SAME BENEFITS. YOU KNOW IN A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY AND THEN THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO SAY. HOW CAN WE GET CREATIVE ABOUT. PAY FOR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE- PRIMARY CARE SET ASIDE IS COMPLICATED BUT YOU KNOW I GET THE POINT- SO I THINK I THINK THIS IS THE TIME FRAME ISSUE WE'VE GOT TO GET. WERE WAY TOO COMPLICATED AT THE MOMENT. RIGHT WELL LEAD TO HOPEFULLY DERBY CONTINUE DIALOGUE I KNOW THERE'S A- THERE'S ALSO A CHILDREN'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR MEDI CAL TO- TO GET SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT- SO. HOPEFULLY THEY CAN BE ENGAGE SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS WELL- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE- SAYING ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY IN SOME SENSES HOW DO WE SIMPLIFY. FIRST SIMPLIFY SO THAT WE HAVE CLEAR SIGNALS ALSO BECAUSE ONCE TOO COMPLEX. NOW ARE THE SIGNALS THAT WE SEND TO PLANS AND OTHERS- YOU KNOW GET LOST IN THE NOISE RIGHT SO WE CAN WE CAN PROVIDE MORE. CLEAR DIRECTION AND INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE AND IS- ALSO WITH THAT SIMPLICITY REDUCE THE OVER BUT THE OVERHEAD BUT THEN FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE BUILD AND THINK ABOUT WHAT MECHANISMS WHO UP IN PLACE THAT. WOULD BOTH BE ADMINISTRATIVELY PERHAPS- THIS STRAIGHT FORWARD AND CLEAR AND STILL ACHIEVE THE AIMS AIMS THAT WE WANT BUT CERTAINLY HOPES WE CAN EXPLORE DIFFERENT IDEAS AND HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING THAT. THIS IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. THANK YOU AND YES. YEAH I WOULD JUST ALSO ADD ONS THAT IN TERMS OF CONSIDERATIONS- WE'VE SEEN GREAT PROMISE WITH THE USE OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND REALLY KIND OF UTILIZING THEM TO BUILD THOSE BRIDGES BETWEEN THE PLANTS BETWEEN PROVIDERS- AND REALLY IMPROVING. ON DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES- SO WE WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND KIND OF BUILDING THAT INTO THE- KIND OF THE NATURE OF HOW HOW CARE IS DELIVERED- AND THEN ALSO ASKING THE DEPARTMENT TO RELEASE THAT YOU KNOW AGGRESSIVE TARGETS FOR. DISPARITY REDUCTION- AND UTILIZING THESE CREATIVE MODELS TO BRING IN COMMUNITY PARTNERS YOU KNOW LOOKING AT POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT. IN COORDINATION WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE DEALERS- STRATEGY SHOULD BE AND THEN. YOU KNOW PROVIDING BONUSES FOR YOU KNOW GOOD PERFORMANCE AROUND THOSE. YOU OKAY WELL THANK YOU ALL OF THANK YOU SO MUCH ROOMS WHEN YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS THE THREE OF US. THE HEALTH LAFOLLETTE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OVERSIGHT OF PLAN RESPONSE WAS UNDER THE MEDIC HOW WELL NOW CAL AIM AGAIN SAYS THEY SAID SO ALL RIGHT SO YOU'RE BACK ON THE PODIUM FOR. KELLY WELCOME. HER EIGHT SO YES I THINK YESTERDAY WHEN- THE SECRETARY ANNOUNCED THAT I TOP THAT IT WAS GOING BACK TO KELLY KNOWS THE LARGEST HERE THAT WE HEARD OF. MORNING THEY'RE CALLING IT NAME GATE APPARENTLY IT'S A THE THING SO- SO YES WE'RE CALLING IT CALLIN. OF THE RECALL THE CAL AIM ND STATUS STATE ADDRESS I THINK IT WAS DONE THEN. WE AGREE- SO I THINK- YOU KNOW WE AT THE DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CAL AIM FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO ME PERSONALLY- GO ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS. WITH VERYONE WE LITERALLY WENT FROM- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AT THE VERY TOP TWO I'M SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY THE COAST AND HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH PROVIDERS BENEFICIARIES OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS REALLY TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING MEDI CAL WHERE THEIR BEST PRACTICES THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE AND TAKE TO SCALE- IT AND REALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH PEOPLE ON DID A LOT OF INTERNAL DISCUSSION- THROUGH- THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE PRIORITIES ARE WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE DO- WHERE HOW CAN WE MOVE THE NEEDLE WITHIN MEDICARE. ON AND THAT IS THE CALLIE PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT IN ADMINISTRATION PUT FORWARD AT THE END OF OCTOBER. THERE'S THREE MAN GOALS OF CALLIE AND THE QUICKLY GET INTO THE PIECES THEN MANAGE CARE AND THE WITH UBER COMPONENTS OUR MOVIE FORWARD SO BUT- I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT KIND OF FOUNDATION FOR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. THIS BECAUSE IT IS BROAD IT IS ACROSS ALL OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS IT'S DOCTOR. WITH THE BREAD BUT MEDI CAL CARE BUT IT'S REALLY LOOKING AT BY MEMBER. I IN MANAGING A RISKY NEED TO RECALL PERSON PURCHASE AND SOCIAL. OF HEALTH WE REALLY REALLY MEAN THAT THIS PARTY PROPOSAL OR WANT TO MAKE. A STEP FORWARD IN REGARD TO PER% CENTER. ON IT SURE THERE CAN CARE. THESE PART SEASON OF THE IN. THE PROPOSAL'S REALLY IT'S ON AS WELL AS IN A FINE SOCIAL THE TERM THE HEALTH. IN MAKING A PRIORITY TO RID THOSE. FROM OUR SAYS. AND FOR THAT BENEFIT. YOU ARE HAVE. A NEXT SCHOOL IS A AT. MORE CONSISTENT STREAMLINE SYSTEM SO TO THE CON. TODAY SOMETIMES WHEN WE TALK TO OUR PROVIDERS WILL SAY WHEN THEY SEE A MEDI CAL PATIENT ON THE AMOUNT OF COMPLEXITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER STACK OF PAPERS VERSES OTHER PATIENTS. HOWDO WE LOOK AT THE COMPLEXITY ACROSS OUR SYSTEM BOTH FOR BOTH THE STATE ARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE PROVIDERS AND OR BENEFIT. HERE IS THAT A MORE SEAMLESS SYSTEM IN A LOT OF OUR PROPOSALS ABOUT STREAMLINING AND STANDARDIZING STATEWIDE REALLY SPEAK TO THOSE PARTICULAR INITIATIVES. ON TO HELP IMPROVE INCLUDING OUR RATE OF DEVELOPMENT REALLY LOOKING AT HOW DO WE SIMPLIFY OUR RATE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THESE. ON TO MAKE THAT AN EASIER PROCESS AND THEN LAST BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST IMPROVING QUALITY OUTCOMES TO DRIVE SYSTEM IS THIS PETE WHY WE'RE- IT IS A MORE YEAR AND SO WELL THERE'S A LOT GOING LIVE OR PROPOSED TO GO LIVE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT IS OVER A SERIES OF YEARS AT THE AT THIS POINT WE'RE UP TO ABOUT EIGHT YEARS ON THE ROAD MAP. OF THOSE CHANGES UNDER CALLIN AND TODAY KEEP VERY HIGH LEVEL. AND THERE IS A VERY LONG. ON OUR WEBSITE WITH MORE DETAILS- I HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH A FOUR MONTH STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AT THIS POINT. AND WE HAVE BEEN TAILORING THE PROPOSAL SENSE THAT WAS POSTED AND SO THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE POSTING AN UPDATED PROPOSAL AT THE END OF MARCH. TO REFLECT ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. SO FIRST OKAY OF DO A QUICK RUN DOWN THE WAIVERS AND THE TRANSITION THERE A HIGH LEVEL RUN THROUGH OF THE PROPOSALS AND THEN OF COURSE OPEN FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE- SO. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A VERY LARGE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER ARE MANAGED CARE THIRTY AS WELL AS WELL AS SOME OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE WHOLE PERSON CARE PRIME. GLOBAL PAYMENT PROGRAM ARE IN THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN. ON THIS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN RELEASED A MEMO ON THAT CHANGED THE WAY BUDGET NEUTRALITY IS CALCULATED. ON THERE FOR AT THIS POINT CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE MOVING FORWARD WITH IN THE LAB A LARGE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER. MOVING FORWARD BUT WE WILL HAVE A SMALL ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAY FOR MOVING FORWARD WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE OUR GLOBAL PAYMENT PROGRAM. WILL PUT PUT THAT FOR TWO SEE AS FOR. I'M AS- YES. THIRTY THREE IN AND SOME OTHER OF POPPY. PASS THROUGHS ARE REQUIRED THROUGH IN THE- FIFTY AND THERE'S NOT A- FOR. AUTHORITY AND THEN WE PLAN ON A TRANSITIONING OUR MANAGED CARE OF FORTY FROM THAT ELEVEN FIFTEEN TO IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE CURRENTLY OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH WAIVER- IS WHERE WE- WE ALSO HAVE NINETY FIFTY BE SO WE PLAN ON BUILDING OUR- MANAGED CARE PLAN. MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER MANAGE CARE FUNCTIONS IN ONE LARGE CALIFORNIA. A NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE WAIVER. I THINK FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE YOU WILL SEE THIS REITERATE IS ONE OF OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES WITHIN CAL AIMS. I'M IN ADDITION TO THE PRIMARY GOALS IS REALLY ABOUT HOW DO WE- INTEGRATE THE DELIVERY SYSTEM OUTLINED ARE FUNDING ARE REPORTING OR QUALITY OR INFRASTRUCTURE TOWARDS COMMON GOALS. FOR TOO LONG WE'VE HAD VERY SILO TO- STREAMS ON AND WE REALLY WANT TO STEP BACK IN IF WE BUILD IT TO COMPREHENSIVELY ACROSS OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM. LOOKING TO WHERE WE AN ONLINE TO MAKE SURE THINGS ARE VERY CALM. TREAT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE HISTORICAL KIND FUNDING PIECES. CAL THAT EXIST HOW DO WE MAKE IT A MORE SEAMLESS SYSTEM FOR BENEFICIARIES IT IS A VERY. FOCUSED I WOULD JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT ALLEY MS LARGEST NOT EVERYTHING KELLY WILL BE IN. A WAIVER THERE ARETHINGS HAVE TO. TO STAY PLANET AND THEN. IT WILL BE ALL OF IT WILL BE IN OUR MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACTS. IS ON. THEIR ABILITIES. SO LONG AS CERVANTES. THE BILL HEALTH MINISTER DONE PROSPECTIVELY AND INFORMATION NOTICES THE DOES PLAN ON POSTING HEM PRETTY SHORTER CHICHI OF ALL OF TWENTY SO YOU CAN COME OF SEE WHAT CITY WHAT FEDERAL AUTHORITIES WE ARE GETTING A LOT OF QUESTIONS SO WE DO PLAN ON PROVIDING A CHEESY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT INFORMATION. SO CALLIN HAS A TWENTY TWO PROPOSALS- IN IT AT THIS TIME- AND I'M REALLY GONNA FOCUS ON THE ONES WITHIN THE MANAGED CARE SPACE AS WELL AS THOSE GOING LIVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW. AND TO GET INTO QUESTIONS. SO THE TWO BIGGEST PIECES THAT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A EXTENSIVE CONVERSATION ON WITH OUR- MANAGED CARE PLAN COLLEAGUES WITH OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS IN OUR COUNTIES OR WORKGROUP IN OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PROVIDERS- IS ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES. SO FOR ENHANCE OUR MANAGEMENT THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING A STATEWIDE A NEW STATEWIDE BENEFIT- CALLING HIS CARE MANAGEMENT. IT IS REALLY TAKING THE IDEA OF INDIVIDUALS WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS OFTEN THOSE RECEIVING COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT BUYER MANAGED CARE PLANS TODAY. IN TAKING THE HIGHEST NEED BENEFICIARIES WHO HAVE VERY COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS BUT ALSO A LOT OF SOCIAL- OR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND GIVING THEM A HIGHER TOUCH OUTSIDE OF THE FOUR WALLS OFTENTIMES. IN THE BEAUTY OF FOR HOMELESS FOR EXAMPLE WOULD STREET BASED TYPE ENGAGEMENT. ON VERY HIGH TOUCH. A LOT OF FACE TO FACE ON IT'S NOT YOUR BILL IN BETTER. RUN A LIST. ON THE- CASE MANAGEMENT IS NOT GOING TO WORK WITH SOME OF THESE. MORE VULNERABLE HIGHER TOUCH IN JEWEL'S AND SO REALLY TAKE THE NEXT LEVEL ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. FOR THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS HOW YOU TO EXERT. IS BEING RELEASED. JAIL AND THEN ALSO THOSE IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES TRANSITIONING CHILDREN OF COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS. UP TO COMPLEMENT THAT WE ARE PROPOSING A THIRTEEN IN LIEU OF SERVICES- INFLUENCERS IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE END THERE'S TO KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE BUCKETS. ON THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS ADDRESS. THERE IS A HOUSING PACKAGE FOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT NAVIGATION SERVICES- LOOKING AT HOUSING DEPOSITS HOUSING LIAISON SERVICES OF WHAT SOMEONE IS HOUSE. MAKING SURE THAT THEY REMAIN HOUSES A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF GETTING THEM INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. AS WELL AS HAVING OTHER STEP DOWN OPPORTUNITIES CALLIN IS REALLY ABOUT LOOKING ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE- FROM BIRTH TO DEATH BUT MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE APPROPRIATE STEP DOWN OPPORTUNITIES ESPECIALLY FOR YOUR MOST VULNERABLE. FOR EXAMPLE IF THE HOMELESS PERSON IS IN AN INPATIENT SETTING AN OTHERWISE WOULD BE OF THE DISH CHARGE% NORMALLY TO HOME TO BE ABLE TO HEAL. ON MAY BE NEEDING SOME WOUND CARE OTHER CLINICAL SERVICES BUT IF A POSITION DOESN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE DISH CHARGING THEM TO THE STREET. THEY MAY LINGER IN THAT INPATIENT SETTING FOR AN EXTREMELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME. ONE OF OUR INTO OF SERVICES IS RECRUITED OF CARE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THAT INDIVIDUAL TO BE DISCHARGED TO A LOVER LOWER LEVEL OF CARE MORE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE. IN CONTINUE TO RE SERVICERS IN OUR OPINION ALSO ALLOW SOMEONE TO COME IN FROM ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH THE INDIVIDUAL AND HOPEFULLY CONNECT THEM WITH HOUSING SERVICES. SO YOU'LL SEE A KIND OF HOUSING SUITE THERE IS ALSO A LARGE NUMBER OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES FOCUSED ON HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. ANOTHER A HUGE GOAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT IS ENSURING THE INDIVIDUALS- CAN SAFELY RESIDE IN THE COMMUNITIES OF SOMEONE HAS BEEN IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IT WOULD BE CITY FOR THEM TO RESIDE IN THE COMMUNITY ALLOWING FOR THE ADDITIONAL A WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT ALLOW THEM TO. LIVE SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY AND OUTSIDE OF A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IS IMPORTANT TO THE DEPARTMENT THIS IS VERY. TO OTHER. MONEY A- EASY T. IS ALSO A VERY COMPLEMENT. OF MANY OF THE HOME TO ME A SERVICES THAT WE- IN OUR NINETEEN FIFTEEN C. WAIVERS THAT YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH. SO THOSE ARE TWO VERY BIG PIECES THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON. WOULD BE CONTRACTING WITH THEIR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO DO. YOU ALSO SEE IN OUR PROPOSAL- INFORMATION AROUND REGIONAL RATE AS SETTING SHARED RISK AND SHARED SAVING- OPPORTUNITIES IN THE OUT YEARS OF CAL LAME- YOU WILL SEE THAT WE ARE PROPOSING SINCE. JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO HAVE A STANDARDIZED BENEFIT STATEWIDE SO ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE SAME BENEFIT. STATEWIDE BASICALLY THAT MEANS THAT WE ARE CARVING IN LONG TERM CARE STATEWIDE AS WELL AS TRANSPLANTS. CURRENTLY LONG TERM CARE IS CARVED IN IN OUR CCI IN OUR COAST COUNTIES- SO IT'S REALLY TAKING THE REST OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND CARVING THAT IN- YOU ALSO SEE THAT WE HAVE. A KIND OF TWO PHASED A MANDATORY MANAGED CARE AND ROLL MEANT TRANSITION. SO WE HAVE STARTING IN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALL NON TO WILL POPULATIONS BECOMING MANDATORY MANAGED CARE STATEWIDE. THE TWO EXCEPTIONS ARE THE FEW EXCEPTIONS ARE- RESTRICTED SCOPE WOULD REMAIN IN FEE FOR SERVICE SHARE OF COSTS. WILL REMAIN IN FEE FOR SERVICE- WE ARE. ESSENTIALLY SAYING STATUS QUO WHEN IT COMES TO FOSTER YOUTH INTEL WE- FINISH OUR FOSTER. ST WORK. I'M AND THEN COURSE PRESENTED ELIGIBILITY REMAIN ENVY FOR SERVICE THERE ARE FEW OTHER EXCEPTIONS WE HAVE A PRETTY HEFTY CHART. ON BREAKING IT ALL DOWN ON AND THEN IN TWENTY THREE WE PROPOSE ALL DO A POPULATIONS MOVE IN. THIS WOULD INCLUDE THAT WE HAVE CERTAIN ZIP CODES TODAY THAT DON'T HAVE MANAGED CARE WE ARE PROPOSING THAT THOSE THAT CODES WOULD BE. MANAGED CARE ZIP CODES- AND SO JUST CLARIFYING THAT AS WELL. YOU'LL ALSO SEE- A SUITE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHANGES I WON'T GET IN THOSE TODAY SINCE YOUR MAIN FOCUS IS MANAGED CARE TODAY. HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT IS PUSHING A VERY AGGRESSIVE A REFORM OF OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES- INCLUDING PAYMENT REFORM INTEGRATION AND CHANGES TO MEDICAL NECESSITY- FOR BENEFICIARIES- AS WELL AS RENEWING OUR DMC ODS-WE ALSO ARE WORKING TO TRANSITION THE DENTAL- BENEFITS FROM DTI OUR DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE. WE HAVE FOUR PIECES OF THAT MOVING INTO CAL LAME- AND THOSE WOULD GO LIVE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE LAST THING THAT I'D MNTIONED IN REGARDS TO THE PIECES HERE TOUCHING THE MEASURE PLAN. WE ALSO ARE LOOKING AT A MAN DATING- WHEN SOMEONE IS RELEASED FROM INCARCERATION THAT THEY BE SCREENED FOR MEDI CAL- UPON THAT RELEASE- IN MAKING THAT A MANDATE TO DATE IS VOLUNTARY WE HAVE SOME GREAT VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS HAPPENING STATEWIDE. WE WANNA LESS LEVERAGE THOSE BEST PRACTICES AND LESSONS LEARNED. ON AND WE WANT TO MAKE THAT A STATEWIDE MANDATE BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THAT INCLUDES A MANDATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WARM HAND OFF- FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RECEIVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT WHILE INCARCERATED- TO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S THREE OTHER PROPOSALS- THAT WE ARE STILL KIND OF EXPLORE THANK ALSO JUST ONE TO MENTION AS WE ARE. AT AND GREAT PLAN. ON A LOT TO WORK THROUGH THERE WERE. ENTITY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE- SERVICE ARE. AS OUR SUBTLE FOR DAY AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH AND AS YOU DE AND POTENTIALLY ALSO THE DENTALS IN THERE. IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED PIECE THE WE'RE CONTINUING THE WORKER PIECES THERE. I'M WE LIKE TO. IF YOU. IN THE TO STEVE WE HAVE FULL IN. SO IT'S TO GO BY WE HAVE. TACK FOR TWENTY TWO. FOUR FIFTHS OF. DATE WE ARE ALSO LAUNCHING I'M IN APRIL A FOSTER CARE A MODEL OF CARE WORKGROUP WE REALLY WANT TO STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE PROVIDE CARE TO FOSTER YOUTH IN CHILDREN- BETTER- BECAUSE OF THE- CLASS CITIES OF BOTH. PHYSICAL AT THE HAVE THE MAIN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AND NOT ALL OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES HAD WE PROVIDE A BETTER SERVICE FOR THEM- AND THEN LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING AT EXPLORING MENTAL HEALTH CONTINUE OF CARE WAIVER- WHERE WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR I AM THE SERVICES ON MENTAL HEALTH SIMILAR TO OUR S. U. D. BUT REALLY WANTING TO LOOK AT IT MORE AND HOW DO WE BUILD OUR- OUTPATIENT COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND STILL EXPLORING THE PROS AND CONS OF THAT CONSIDERATION AS WE CONTINUE TO DO SOME RESEARCH SO JUST TO KIND OF- DO ONE LAST PIECE BEFORE WE TURN IT OVER FOR QUESTIONS- WE KNOW THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS BIG. AND IT IS BOLD- WE DON'T WANT THE POLICY TO FALL SHORT ON IMPLEMENTATION. ON THAT IS SOMETHING WE'RE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT RIGHT NOW SO WE WILL BE. IMPLEMENTING FOR BOTH THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICE- PIECES. BECAUSE WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HELP HOMES WILL BE TRANSITIONING IN TO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND INTO OF SERVICES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROCESS. ON THAT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING. SO WE ARE PROPOSING THAT WILL BE ROLLING OUT A NUMBER OF WHAT WE'RE CALLING REGIONAL MEETINGS. WHERE WE WILL COME TO THOSE MEETINGS INVITING. ON THE WHOLE PERSON CARE ENTITIES THE CBC IT MEANS THE MANAGED CARE PLANS THE COUNTIES- INCLUDING BEHAVIOR ALL THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. TO ROLL OVER- TO GO OVER WERE CALLING TOOL KITS. WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD BE CONSIDERING HOW DO WE TRANSITION THESE BENEFITS INTO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. AND REALLY INCORPORATING ENGAGING PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THROUGH THOSE REGIONAL MEETINGS AND TOOL KIT SESSIONS WE WILL ALSO BE IDENTIFYING. AREAS WHERE WE ARE VERY VULNERABLE IN THE STATE TO SEND WEBER CALLING STRIKE TEAMS IN- IN THE STRIKE TEAMS WOULD GO INTO LOCAL ENVIRONMENTS HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH. BUT THERE'S A MANAGED CARE PLAN. I HOPE CARE IN. TO CONVERSATIONS AND HELP FACILITATE. ON THIS TRANSITION IT IS A BIG TRANSITION AND IT'S A LOT OF WORK WE WANT THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL- SO AS I MENTIONED WE DO PLAN ON- POSTING OUR- FINAL PROPOSALS ON THE- APARTMENTS. END OF MARCH EARLY APRIL WE- BE THEN HAVING. OUR WAIVER PUBLIC HEARINGS IN MAY- HAS A THIRTY DAY PUBLIC. I THAT WOULD BE UP DO IT ANYWAY SUBMIT. WITH THE INTENTION PUTTING OUR WAIVERS YEMEN IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR. AND THEN WE WOULD CAN TO NEGOTIATE THE WAIVERS WE CMS. THIS YEAR. SO JUST JUST IN SENATOR TADO. I WANTED TO INTRODUCE MYSELF I'M DOCTOR BRAG OVER YOUR NEW DH CS DIRECTOR FROM THE SALE OF. I THINK IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THERE'S BEEN SOME NICE SUCCESS WITH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE AND THE HEALTH HOMES PROGRAMS BUT THOSE WERE VOLUNTARY IN A SENSE THERE'S- THERE'S- THEY'RE NOT IN ALL AREAS. AND THEY'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR COUNTY AND WHAT THE ISSUES WERE WHERE IS ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT NOW BECOMES A STATEWIDE BENEFIT AND IT'S IN NOW ALL HEALTH PLANS UP TO DELIVER THIS LEVEL. OF ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT TO THEIR MEMBERS AND SO YOU GET TO THE KEY IS WHERE THERE ARE WHOLE PERSON KAREN AND HELPFULNESS PROGRAMS OCCURRING YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT TRANSITION WORKS. BECAUSE SOME OF THEM HAVE HAD SUCCESS OVER CARING FOR THESE VERY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE TARGETED THOUGH. SO WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HEALTH HOMES FOR HEALTH THOSE FOCUSED MOSTLY ON THE HIGH UTILIZED THERE'S CALL PERSON CARE HOMELESS SOME- JUSTICE INVOLVED SOMEHOW UTILIZES NOW IT'S SIX DIFFERENT YOU KNOW POPULATIONS INCLUDING CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX ISSUES. INDIVIDUALS AT REST TO GOING TO A LONG TERM CARE HELPING INDIVIDUALS TO GET OUT OF LONG TERM CARE. THEIR HEALTH PLANS THAT HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS ON THAT LAST ONE THERE COUNTIES THAT HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS WITH WHOLE PERSON CARE. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT ALL NOW YOU KNOW GOES TO THIS THIS- STATEWIDE BENEFT WITH THE WITH THE CM. AND THEN THE TOOLS OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR SOME OF THESE MEMBERS SO I THINK. IT'S A LOT OF WORK ON THE DEPARTMENT'S PART- AND IT'S A LOT OF IT'S A SIGNIFICANT LIVE FOR HEALTH PLANS AND COMMUNITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HAVEN'T NECESSARILY DONE ANY OF THIS YET. SO THERE'S JUST GOING TO BE THAT YOU KNOW THAT TRANSITION WORK THATWE NEED TO DO WHERE IT'S WORKING. KEEP IT GOING WHERE IT HASN'T BEEN DONE HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT SOLUTIONS THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE BUT- I THINK IT'S A REALLY REALLY IMPRESSIVE EFFORT. OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS. I HAVE A FEW KEY QUESTIONS HERE- SO AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION IS A VERY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW IT'S A VERY LARGE DOCUMENT AND THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS- ON THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY MAKES SENSE THAT WE HAVE THESE VERY HIGH RISK FOR WILL POPULATIONS- THAT. NEED ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW HELP AND FOCUS- BUT SOME OF THE POPULATIONS THAT NIGHT OF THE SIX CATEGORIES THEY THEY ALL NEED SERVICE INTENSIVE TOUCHES AND SO FORTH BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS AND SO I JUST- SO FIRST OF ALL IS THAT IN TERMS OF DEFINING WHO AND WHO WHO WHO WOULD. LATER GO BACK AS A SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS A STATE WIDE BENEFIT SO THAT MEANS WERE CALLING ON. EVERY MANAGED CARE FOR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PROVIDE THEM. IS THAT HOW WE'RE DOING IT OR SO IT'S THROUGH SO IT'S THROUGH THE MEDICARE OUT EACH OF THE MANTA CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS WHO WHICH IF THEY HAVE SOMEONE WHO FITS AND THE ONE OF THE SIX CATEGORIES AND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. THE WE ARE WE WILL BE HOLDING THE MANAGED CARE PLANS THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS REQUIRED- TO PROVIDE THIS BENEFIT- FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT THE WAY THEY IDENTIFY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS AND THEN ENGAGING WITH INDIVIDUAL WITH ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IT IS GOING TO TAKE IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL TAKE A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT WITH AN INDIVIDUAL TO- TO DO OUTRAGE I GOT OKAY SO. AND THE THING IS THAT YOU HAVE SOME. YOUR PLANS STERN SINGLE COUNTY OF SOME THEIR MULTIPLE COUNTIES SUTERA. SO YES OF THE- PETERSON SO YOU MENTION CHILDREN SPECIAL NEEDS- CERTAINLY NEIL OUR SERVICES- AND WE FACT IT'S LIKELY THE CCS PROGRAM LONG TIME AGO. BUT I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT WE EXPECT EACH INDIVIDUAL MANAGED CARE PLANS TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS BECAUSE THEIR BIGGEST ISSUE I MEAN WONDER ISSUES OF COURSE CORONATION CARES OF WHAT THE WONDER BIGGEST ISSUES. IS THAT THEY NEED PEDIATRIC SUBSPECIALTY CARE WHICH IS. NOT PRESENT IN EVERY COUNTY THAT IS IN FACT ACTUALLY MEAN I MEAN. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA BIG STATES SOMEWHERE IN THE STATE HOPEFULLY BUT SOMETIMES MAY EVEN NEED CARE THAT OUTSIDE OF THE STATE IF THEY HAVE A REALLY SPECIALIZED CONDITION. AND SO. THAT SO WE'RE TALKING INTENSIVE TOUCH WHICH IS PERHAPS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN LET'S SAY SOMEONE WHO'S HOMELESS. WHO NEEDS A LOT MORE LIKE SOCIAL SERVICES AND SO FORTH AND DAMIANA HEALTH AND SO FORTH BUT- DEAD BUT THOSE SERVICES MAY BE MORE AVAILABLE. WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND THEREFORE FOR A HEALTH PLAN THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN. CONTRACTING FOR THAT MEAL MAY INVOLVE CORNY COUNTY AND SOME OTHER TYPES OF STUFF THE NON PROFITS. BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY WITH ANSWER THE CATCHMENT AREA THAT THE PLAN. NORMALLY OPERATES AND SO. NOW THAT MAY HAVE SO THEIR OWN. IN TRYING TO PROVIDE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BUT THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN SAYING WELL I A NOW NEED A CONTRACT WITH THE SPECIALIST AT TEACHERS REGION ATTIC DISEASE THAT ONLY EXISTS IN BOSTON AND SAN FIERRO SAN FRANCISCO. AND ON THE PLAN. DID YOU KNOW DOWN AND KERN ERROR UP AND YOU KNOW. ARE AT THE KERN DOES A GREAT JOB BUT AS THE DAY WERE HERE SITES ARE PICKED ON A LITTLE BIT BUT OUR VIEW NO ONE THE GMC PLANS IN SACRAMENTO AND BEEN FORTUNE WE CAN'T PROVIDE IT THAT'S IT UC DAVIS WHICH IS STILL TERTIARY CARE CENTER. SO I GUESS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT NOW WE FRAGMENTED THIS AMONGST ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLANS IN EACH pTRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTRACT WITH THESE VERY RARE SUB SPECIALISTS. AND IN FACT MOST F THE POLICY EXPERTS WOULD SAY ACTUALLY SHOULD REGIONALES TO CARE FOR THOSE PEOPLE SO THAT'S DIFFERENT SO I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW SO. SO I'M JUST CONCERNED WERE MIXING UP OF THIS OF THIS CONCEPT OF ENHANCE CARE I AM ALL ON BOARD WITH SOUNDS GREAT. I WILL BE SURE WITHIN THAT POPULATION ARE WE PROVIDING THE RIGHT KIND OF STRUCTURE FOR THAT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE WE NEED TO ENHANCE. LIKE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SAYS NO BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND HOUSING AND SO FORTH. THE ABSOLUTE VERSES I NEED HIGHLY SPECIALIZED- YOU KNOW MEDICAL CARE- HIGHLY SPECIALIZED SERVICES THAT ARE IN MY GEOGRAPHIC AREA BUT NOW WE'RE GIVING IT UP. THAT'S WHERE PERHAPS IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR THE STATE OPERATE AS A WHOLE THEN TO FARM IT OUT CONTRACT OUT TO GUESS WHAT OH BY THE WAY YOU JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A KID BUT THE SPED RAREST. CONDITION. IT'S YOUR JOB TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. OKAY NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. DEAL WITH THIS VERY UNUSUAL SITUATION SITUATION. SO WHAT I WOULD DIFFERENTIATE THE MEDICAL CARE DELIVERY FROM THE CARE MANAGEMENT SO YOUR EXAMPLE HAVING SENT SOMEONE TO JOHN SAW CHILD TO JOHNS HOPKINS FOR EXAMPLE- CCS PROGRAM DOESN'T CHANGE OTHER THAN YOU KNOW WORDS ARE ANY CHANGE IN THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL. SO FROM THE MEDICAL CARE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE CARE TO THE CHILDREN. NOT REALLY CHANGING IN THAT SENSE SO JUST TO CLARIFY SO THIS IS THAT A GOOD THROUGH SEUSS THREE CCS MOST CASES THEY WOULD GO THROUGH CCS THE EXAMPLE I GAVE WAS VERY COMPLICATED AND THERE WAS HE SAID YOU KNOW TRY TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT WE'RE NOW ON THE CHILDREN AREA IS YOU PROVIDE THE CARE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT KID GETS TO THE CARE WHETHER IT'S CCS WHETHER IT'S PLAN RESPONSIBILITY SO YOU'D BE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE CCS AGENCY IF THE CHILD AS SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY. SO YOU THAT CENTRAL HUB AT A VERY FACE TO FACE VERY HIGH TOUCH MODEL MAKING SURE THAT THE CHILD GOES WHEREVER THEY NEED TO GO. THAT RESPOND THAT FUNCTIONALITY TO SOME EXTENT IS THE PLANS NOW IS AT A HIGHER LEVEL BUT YOUR POINT ABOUT IT THE KIND OF SERVICES IN THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA PROVIDE SERVICES TO HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL IS ABSOLUTELY WELL TAKEN AND THAT'S THE KEY SO FOR EXAMPLE. I'M THINKING PLANS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO RELATE AND TAKE CARE OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS THEY'RE GONNA TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY AGENCIES THAT HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE OF GOING TO THE STREET HELPING TO FIND THAT PERSON BUT THEN IT'S GOT IT THEN YOU GOT TO HAVE THE INTERFACE RIGHT BACK WITH THE PLAN TO GET ON THE CARE THEY NEED. A HAND OR TO FIGURE OUT YOUR OPTIONS AROUND HOUSING AND OR TO FIGURE OUT ANYTHING ELSE OF THAT PERSON NEEDS SO YOUR POINT IS VERY WILL TELL. EACH OF THE POPULAR TUNES IS GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WORK IS GOING TO TAKE SPECIALIZED INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS OR ENTITY THESE PARTICULAR COMMUNITY ENTITIES OR COUNTIES THAT CAN HELP. BUT IT DOESN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE MEDICAL CARE DELIVERY RESPONSIBILITY. SO YOUR. EXAMPLE WITH THE CHILD NINE NINE TIMES OUT OF A HUNDRED BE A CEASE. KID BUT THE PLAN GOT THIS CARE MAY. THAT'S MAKE A SURE WE'RE WITH CITIES US. THE DUTCH SHELL GETS AT THE NEED. IT'S A PLAY MEMBER. IT THEY ARE PLAN MEMBER SORRY SO LATE THEY JUST THE PERSONAL OCCUR SO YOU HAVE- SO. SOME COUNTIES ARE BECAUSE OF THE I. ONE PLANT BUT MANY COUNTY SOME MULTIPLE PLANS. AND THE AND AGAIN I DIED THEY GET I LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING THIS ENHANCE THE ABSENT THE OPERATIONALLY. SO DO YOU. DO YOU HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WITH A DUPLICATION SO WE HAVE GMC HERE IN SACRAMENTO I MEAN WE'RE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT SIMPLIFY IT REFORM AND SO FORTH BUT YEAH SO- BUT YOU HAVE PLANS. NOW WHETHER IT'S- IN DIFFERENT WAYS OF MULTIPLE- AND SO ARE WE GONNA. EVER GOT DUPLICATION BECAUSE EACH PLANS EXPECTED TO DO THE SAME THING AND EXCEPT THAT NOW THEY HAVE THIS POPULATION THAT ONE HAS THAT PART YOU KNOW THIS MANAGE YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE SIGNED. UP AND SO HOW HOW. THEN YOU HAVE A KEY THE DROP. WELL THE BE MOST COUNTIES THAT MEET A COUNTY AND SO IT'S DOESN'T MAKE. MORE SENSE FOR EACH PLAN TO HAVE TO DO THIS SEPARATELY FOR THE THEIR SUBPOPULATION- AND IF YOU HAVE. A LOT OF PLANS AND GET EVEN SUBDIVIDED MORE VERSES. WHAT'S INTERFACE WITH A BETWEEN. THE COUNTY WHICH IS A RESPONSIBILITY FOR A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT SERVICES- ON THE SOCIAL SERVICE SIDE. AND THE- AND THE PLAN IN TERMS OF WHO'S- WHO'S- RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CORONATION THESE VARIOUS- THE FOR THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. FIRST I THINK THE BIGGEST THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IS ACTUALLY NOT A FUNCTION WELL WE ARE HOLDING THE MANAGED CARE PLAN RESPONSIBLE WE ARE EXPECTING THEM TO CONTRACT WITH. ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS TODAY OFTEN RUN BY PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS OR COUNTY ENTITIES WE WOULD STILL EXPECT THAT. WHILE THEY'RE DOING THEIR WHOLE PERSON CARE TODAY THEY WOULD ALSO BECOME ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDERS THE MANAGED CARE PLAN WOULD BE CONTRACTING. WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT IT IT THERE'S TWO PLANS I'M GONNA KEEP IT SIMPLE AND A TWO TWO PLANS WHEN COUNTY BECAUSE GMC IS I AGREE MORE COMPLICATED WITH ALL OF THE PLANS- BUT- YOU KNOW. WERE HOPING THAT BOTH PLANS IN EXAM AND THAT EXAMPLE ON BOTH PLANS WOULD HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THAT ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDER. WHO HAS A MODEL OF CARE WHO IS SPECIFIC TO THE HOMELESS POPULATION OR THE CHILDREN OR WOOD OR THE TRANSITIONS OUT OF LNG TERM CARE SO THEY WILL HAVE A BROAD BASED. VARIETY OF PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE CONTRACTING WITH DEPENDING ON THE EXPERTISE THAT THEY BRING TO THE VARIOUS TOP TARGET POPULATIONS- AT AND- MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL HAVE TO BE PRETTY INVOLVED INTO SURE THAT THERE IS A GOOD MODEL OF CARE IN PLACE- BUT- THAT IS WHERE WE GET OUR FEDERAL. AUTHORITY IT'S HOW WE CAN BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW WE- DO ALL OF OUR BENEFITS RIGHT- AND SO I THINK THAT- WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WE'RE NOT EXPECTING MANAGED CARE. LANCE TO BUILD THESE THINGS OUT THEM. THERE MAY BE PAID PLACES IN THE STATE WHERE THAT IS NECESSARY RURAL AREAS WHERE THERE'S NOT. ENOUGH PROVIDERS BUT WE DON LEE EXPECTED THEY ARE GONNA BE CONTRACTING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. WITH COUNTIES- WITH PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS WITH PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS- TYPE OF SERVICE. AND THE JUST CLEAR FIVE AND TERM RECALL SO THE WHOLE PERSON CARE MODEL WHICH WERE FOLDING THE SEN YES NOW WAS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT IN ANY. IN ANY NON COULD WAS AT EMPLOYMENT NON BECAUSE ANY NOT GIVE ME OF SAN DIEGO. AND THERE WE ARE HAVING COMMERCE AND IN SACRAMENTO OF COURSE HAS HOLE IT BUT A WHOLE PERSON CARE NOT THE COUNTY SELF BUT THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO OKAY I'M HAS A WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT IS WELL- AND WE ARE ALREADY WORKING WITH SANDY YOU- IN REGARDS TO THEIR UP COMMISSION THAT THEY HAVE DOWN THERE AND HOW THEY'RE WORKING ON THIS OF HOW WE CAN EVEN DO STREAMLINED REVIEWS. ON OUR SIDE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A MANAGED CARE PLAN IS CONTRACTING WITH THE SAN DIEGO WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT. I'M INSURING THAT WE STREAMLINED OUR VIEWS SO THERE'S NOT SEVEN SEPARATE REVIEW OF THE OF A MANAGED CARE PLAN. IS ON TRACK THAT OUR EXPERIENCE WITH TRYING TO DEAL WITH MULTIPLE PLAN YEAH THE SAME AREA UP IN THE SAME STATE IN THE GEOGRAPHIC SPACE SO THE DEPARTMENT IS ALREADY WORKING WITH- SAN DIEGO THEY'VE REACHED OUT TO US TO PARTNER IN REGARDS TO HOW DO WE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SAN DIEGO THE PLANTS DOWN THERE- AS WELL AS AT THE DEPARTMENT'S REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT THAT'S A SMOOTH TRANSITION FOR THEIR WHOLE PERSON CARE- INTO THE ENHANCE CAN MANAGEMENT. WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WHO ALSO WITH PRIDE BEING JING IN SIMILAR. CHALLENGES NINE. AND THEN THE TERM OF. SO YOU TALK ABOUT FULL INTEGRATION AND THAT YOU SAID THAT'S A FEW YEARS AWAY I MEAN ARE YOU LOOKING AT IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE ON THE PILOT. TRY TO PILOT THAT'LL EARLY EARLIER DO YOU THINK THAT SIDE OF REALIZE YOU'RE STILL TRY TO WORK A LOT OF THAT STUFF OUT. I THINK- FOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING THERE ARE A LOT OF A REALLY AMAZING INTEGRATION EFFORTS GOING ACROSS THE STATE IN THE DEPARTMENT WANTS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO IMMIGRATION- OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN- WE THINK IT'S A REALLY CRITICAL PIECE OF. I WOULD JUST WANT TO OPEN UP WITH THAT I THINK WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS FULL INTEGRATION IS. A TRULY FULLY INTEGRATED ENTITY- WHERE WE ARE PAYING ONE CAPITATION. RATES FOR ALL OF THEIR SERVICES. OBVIOUSLY IN ORDER TO DO THAT WITH REALIGNMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE COUNTY WOULD HAVE TO BE WILLING TO DO THAT- IT IS VERY COMPLEX AND SO WE DO HAVE KIND OF A- LONGER RUN WAY FOR. POLICY DECISIONS FIGURING OUT VERY COMPLEX FINANCING SITUATIONS- AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO. FIGURE POLICY SITUATIONS OUT WE'D HAVE TO SOLICIT SOMEHOW IDENTIFY. WHO ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE CAPABLE OF DOING THIS AND IT'S PROBABLY A PRETTY SHORT LIST OF PEOPLE. ON CAPABLE OF TAKING ON THE FULL BREADTH OF THIS UNDER ONE CONTRACT. ON TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE NETWORK WHETHER THAT BE. ON INCLUDING THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- BEING COMPLETELY ON BOARD WITH THIS. PROPOSAL AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO DO A PRETTY LENGTHY READY MISS PROCESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT POLICIES PROCEDURES IN PLACE. THE NETWORK IS IN PLACE TO MEET OUR SATISFACTION ALL OF THOSE PIECES USUALLY TAKES ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF A READINESS FOR A NEW PLAN. AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A LONGER RUNWAY- ON THIS PARTICULAR ONE JUST GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE POLICY DECISIONS. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FINANCING HAVE TO SOLICIT IDENTIFY WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS AND THAT MAKE SURE THEY'RE READY TO GO LVE. SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE LONGER ONE WAY AND WE ALSO WANT TO ALIGN IT WITH OUR PROCUREMENT TO GO LIVE- BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY REALLY CRITICAL- AND SO. ON WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THIS IS THE FIGURE OUT IN AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING LONGER TIME PERIOD YEAH SO JUST SEND IN THE SHORTER RUN- PILOTS. YOU KNOW LOOKING AT PLACES THAT REALLY DO WANT TO GO EARLIER ON A MORE LIMITED BASIS SO WE START TO LEARN. WHAT IT MEANS TO BE MORE IN A RED AND IT'S ALREADY OCCURRING YEAH. OKAY SO ON AGO JUST WANTED TO INTRODUCE MYSELF I'M DOCTOR GO OVER YOUR NEW DH CS DIRECTOR. THE I APPRECIATE IT. WELCOME ABOARD. THANK YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS AND WELCOME. RIGHT IS SO IN TERMS OF. SO WE KNOW FIRST HALF WE TALKED ABOUT RATE SETTING HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE ESTABLISHED CAPITATION RATES BASED ON HISTORICAL AND SOME THE TOWNS WITH THAT AND SO FORTH- OBVIOUSLY THAT SHOULD NOT STOP US FROM DOING SOMETHING NEW BUT HOW DO YOU PLAN TO ESTABLISH RATES FOR CAL AMY WERE NOW THE PLANS ARE TAKING ON THIS. I MEAN ARE WE GOING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF- ANY SOME OF THIS IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT GASSING BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING PROVIDE SERVICES AT AND PREVIOUSLY BEEN PROVIDED BY THE PLANS WE CAN PROBABLY PRICE OF HOW THEY WERE PROVIDED BY OTHER PEOPLE ETCETERA I MEAN ARE WE GOING TO IS TO GIVE ME SOME SORT OF LIKE SECONDARY RISK BUFFERING OR RECORDER RAIN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO THAT- WE DON'T WANT PLANS BASICALLY FINDING THEMSELVES. LIKE MISS GUESSING AND AGREEING TO A RATE THAT THEN THEY CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER AND- I MEAN IT BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY BIG PLAN THEY CAN DRAW SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT IT'S- COUNTY PLAN THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER SERVICE LINES AND WHATHAPPENS THERE STRUCK STUCK WITH THE LLAMA ABOUT SAYING WELL WHAT WE TRY TO CUT CORNERS BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY OR SOMETHING SO HE WHAT KIND OF THINGS DO WE SEE. IN TERMS OF BOTH ESTABLISHING RATE. BUT THEN ALSO. AND AGAIN THE SOME OF THIS HAS TO DO THE FEDS TO WHAT THE ALLOWS TO DO BUT BUT I MEAN IN TERMS OF THE ELDER VIED LEAST BEFORE WE ROLL IT OUT SOME BUFFERS TO TAKE CARE OF LEGITIMATE ISSUES WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE. BUILT THE THERE'S A MISCALCULATION ARE PART THEIR POWER OR SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THAT. WITH THAT- BASICALLY WE WANT ANYONE RUNNING SHORT OF MONEY MIDWAY THROUGH THE YEAR- AND TRYING TO VOTE NEW SERVICES THAT THEY TURNED OUT THAT THEY FIND CELLS UNABLE TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR. SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO TRY TO BUFFER AGAINST A- I WAS A MISCALCULATION NOW COULD BE ON THE OTHER END WE MIGHT FIND WAYS TO DRAW MONEY BACK BUT- LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THE FIRST PROBLEM- SO- ALL KIND OF SET. UP TO. INTO TWO DIFFERENT BUCKETS THEN HAS TO MENTION IN LIEU OF SERVICES. TO THE DEPARTMENT DOES PLAN ON LEVERAGING OUR EXPERIENCE WITH HEALTH HOMES IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS FOR REBUILDING. BECAUSE IT WAS A HIGH TOUCH- HIGHER UTILIZING POPULATION IN REGARDS TO THAT IT DID HAVE SOME OF THE HOUSING COMPONENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. TO DO PLAN ON LEVERAGING UP BUT IT WILL BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE HEALTH HOMES WAS PAID ON A SUPPLEMENTAL. BASED ON UTILIZATION HERE WE PLAN ON BUILDING THIS INTO THE MANAGED CARE PLAN RATE AS A SEPARATE CATEGORY OF SERVICE SO THAT WE CAN MONITOR IT. ESPECIALLY AS WE ROLL IT OUT TO MAKE SURE WERE SEEN TO EITHER. UNDER OR OR MORE UTILIZATION DEPENDING ON WHAT WE SEE THERE. ON IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO US- IT WILL BE LOSS OF THE BUILDING OTHER SECTIONS BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY ASSUMING IN THESE. THESE NUMBERS ARE BEING. KIND OF CHANGE THE DAR RATE THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS. ACTIVELY WORKING ON A READ ABOUT SO THAT'S ONE CABBIE OUT THERE IS THAT WE'RE STILL VERY MUCH LOOKING AT. HOW ARE WE GOING TO BUILD THIS IN. BUT IT WOULD BE A CENTURY READ SAY ACROSS THE ENTIRE MEDI CAL pOVERSEE. ABOUT 1% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD PROBABLY END UP GETTING THIS HIGHER LEVEL TOUCH ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT BECAUSE IT IS MORE THAN JUST. OUR STATE WE ACTUALLY. THE SERVICE BUT THEY WOULD ALSO PAY FOR MAYBE UP TO THREE OR 5% WERE YOU DOING OUT REGION ENGAGEMENT TO THEM BECAUSE THESE TYPES OF POPULATIONS ARE USUALLY PRETTY COMPLEX. ON THE FIRST TIME YOU ENCOUNTER SOMEONE WHO'S HOMELESS. THEY DON'T JUST AUTOMATICALLY SAY YES I WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN YOUR ENHANCE MERIT YOU KNOW CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OR GET ME AND HOUSING. IT'S AN ENGAGEMENT PROCESS OVER TIME AND SOMETIMES A VERY LONG. TIME SAME IF YOU'RE ENGAGING WITH SOMEONE WHO IS IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WANTED TO TRANSITION TO THE HOME OUR COMMUNITY. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN JUST THE FIRST TIME YOU DO OUT REACH. SO WE WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY BUILDING IN SOME OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT PORTIONS. AND THEN OF THOSE THAT YOU OUT REACHING AGENT WHAT PORTION OF THOSE WILL ACTUALLY RECEIVE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. SO THAT'S HOW WE ARE LOOKING AT THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PORTION. WE WOULD BE BUILT IN. ACROSS THE RATE PROBABLY HAD A PERCENTAGE IN THAT. PERCENT MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE- THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IN IN THE POPULATIONS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- BUT THAT'S APPARENTLY. WERE THINKING ON THE ENHANCE YOUR MNAGEMENT. FOR IN LIEU OF SERVER IS. A LITTLE DIFFERENT. ON AS ANY OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS SINCE ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IS DIFFERENT STATEWIDE SO WE HAVE. A WHOLE PERSON CARE- IN CERTAIN COUNTIES AND WE HAVE HELP HOMES IN CERTAIN COUNTIES AND THEN WE HAVE CERTAIN COUNTIES WITH WITH. NEITHER AND SO WE WILL BE FACTORING THOSE KIND OF- RAMP UP TIME PERIODS WITHIN THE RATES APPROPRIATELY WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HEALTH HOMES OR BOTH AND COUNTY. THEY WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE MORE TO ADD MEDIA- GO LIVE ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE- INSTEAD OF A PLANNED THIS KIND OF RAMPING. UP THOSE TYPES OF FACTORS WILL BE BUILT INTO THE ASSUMPTIONS. OF THE PENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF COUNTY.THAT YOU ARE ALSO PROPOSED EIGHT. I CAN TO. IMPLEMENTATION SO ANYONE WITH A WHOLE PERSON CARE HEALTH COMES WOULD GO LAW. WE WANT. TO TWENTY. AND THEN. PUT OUT THAT WOULD GO LIVE LIVE ON TWENTY TWENTY TO ALLOW FOR THE- ONE MORE TIME FOR THEM TO BE. THEIR TO CONTRACT PROVIDER IS REALLY IMPORTANT KEY- BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO. TO KIND OF THINK OF THE ASSUMPTIONS OF THAT RATE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AS WELL. FOR IN LIEU OF SERVICES SINCE IT IS TECHNICALLY IN LIEU OF SOMETHING MORE EXPENSIVE- WE ARE NOT MAKING REDUCTIONS TO THE IN PATIENT- ER STAYS. ON BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES IN LIEU OF THOSE HIGH COST SERVICES- BUT AS YOU SAW ON THE BUDGET THERE IS. THERE IS MONEY SCORED TO- INCLUDE INTO THE IT THE PLANS RATES FOR IN THE WEB SERVICES. AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE HAVE SEEN- IN OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PLAYED IT LOTS RECOUP OF CARE BEDS GO UP- THROUGH A WHOLE PERSON CARE. I'M SOBERING CENTERS HAVE COME UP- WE DO KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR CCI PLANS PROVIDE- WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THAT PROGRAM. AND SO WE WILL USE SOME UTILIZATION TO BUILD INTO THE RIGHT INITIALLY- AND THEN ONCE THEY START BUILDING UTILIZATION STATEWIDE THAT IT WOULD EVENTUALLY BE CONTINUE TO BE BUILT INTO THE RATE MOVING FORWARD SO IT'S KIND OF. SOME UP FRONT WHERE WE DO SEE IT CERTAIN COUNTIES WHO HAVE TWO WHOLE PERSON CARE. WHERE WE HAVE ALL THE ENCOUNTER DATA ON THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO BUILD IN UP FRONT- AND THEN OVER TIME IS PLANS BUILT THE IN IEU OF SERVICES WE WOULD BUILD THAT AND FACTORED. INTO THEIR REGULAR RATE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THAT BREAK DEVELOPMENT PROCESS- THE ONE THING I WOULD- ALSO. OF FLAG WHEN IT COMES TO THAT IS WE WILL- PLANS IT'S AN OPTIONAL BENEFITS SO THEY WOULD BE TELLING US IN ADVANCE. THEY ARE OR NOT PROVIDING THE INTO OF SERVICES. ON IT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE AWARE OF AND THEN WE WOULD FACTOR THAT IN IN THE FUTURE AS IT STARTING TO. RAMP UP THOSE SERVICES. YES EIGHT APRIL THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRY TO DO IN THE AGENTS TRIED TO I GUESS MY CAUTION IS THAT- THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS SO WHAT BECAUSE WE HAVE AND THE PEN AND WE'RE ALL REST THE WE'RE ALL EXPECTING THE PLAN TO DO SO SEVEN I KNOW THAT YOU'RE YOU KNOW MAYBE WITH SOME PEOPLE MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THESE WITH EXISTING PROGRAM THAT'S RELATIVE SO WE CAN TRY TO GET SAID SERRA SO. BUT YOU KNOW YOU GOT WE GOT IN OF THE ENHANCED CHAIR MANAGEMENT WE GET THE IN LIEU SERVICES WE'RE GONNA BE FINANCIALLY FOLDING IN THE LONG TERM CARE WHICH SOME PLANS MAY NOT HAVE AND SO AND- THEN MORAGA NEGOTIATOR RATE FOR THESE DIFFERENT PIECES RIGHT AND SO SOMEBODY IN THE BACK OFFICE AT THE PLAN IS GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THAT COSTS SO THEY CAN NEGOTIATE. SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR PEOPLE THAT OUT AND SAID THIS IS WHAT WE THINK IT'S KIND OF A- AND IT'S POSSIBLE. EITHER AND I GUESS IT'S ON THE STATE BECAUSE IT BUT IT'S POSSIBLE SOMEONE GUESSED WRONG. RIGHT RIGHT A DAVID DOWSON SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT WE DIDN'T EXPECT RIGHT- SO FOR EXAMPLE- IT. YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE'S A BACKLOG OF PEOPLE WHO NEED NURSING HOME CARE THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT NOW THAT WE KNOW FULL THEN WE GOT SOME IN LIEU WE GOT SOME PEOPLE OUT BUT THEN IT CELLS AND CENTER AND SO TURNS OUT THE RATE. BECAUSE THERE IS A SERVICE THE MAN THAT YOU COULDN'T SEE BECAUSE THIS IS WASN'T ANY FACILITY AVAILABLE NOW SO HAS HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY SCOTT SAVE MONEY WHAT HAPPENED WAS IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY TOOK CARE OF MORE PEOPLE. BECAUSE THERE'S A BACKLOG OR SOMETHING IT SO I JUST SOME SO CIRCUMSTANCE SO WITH THE UNION EXAMPLE WHERE. SOME THAT SHOULD WORK. BECAUSE OF THE SAID SITUATION SO- I UNDERSTAND THAT WAY BACK WHEN WE TRIED IN ENHANCE PRIMARY CARE PAYMENT FOR PRANK YOUR DOCTORS TO BETTER COORDINATE CARES A MODEL THOSE VERY SUCCESSFULLY USED IN SOME STATES LIKE NORTH CAROLINA. BUT APPARENTLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T WORK SO WELL. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THE REASON IT WORKS SO WELL IS BECAUSE OUR MEDI CAL PAYMENTS WHICH ARE ONE AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY ARE SO LOW. THAT INSTEAD OF PEOPLE TAKING ENHANCE PAYMENT AND DOING AS MUCH CORONATION CARED THEY KIND OF TRY TO USE THAT TO KEEP THE PRACTICE IS GOING BECAUSE- THE- FEDERAL BUMP UP RIGHT. AND SO YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY GET THE CHANGE OF BEHAVIOR THAT HAPPENED WHICH BY THE WAY ALSO TAKES AN INVESTMENT SO WE WANT PEOPLE TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. IN THE VERY BEGINNING THAT MAKES ME TAKE A LITTLE MORE MONEY BEFORE THEY FINALLY SWITCH OVER RIGHT SO YOU KNOW THE HOUSE. NOW THAT WE CAN DO THE IN LIEU OF IT'S NOT JUST LIKE SWAPPING SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO. THINK COULD ORGANIZE THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I WOULD PUT AND AGAIN I'M VERY SUPPORT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO- IS TO SAY IS THAT- I WANT TO BE CAREFUL THAT HOW WE DEFINE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THE FIRST FEW YEARS IN THE FIRST YEARS A TRANSITION. THAT WE SET THE RIGHT EXPECTATION SO LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE WITH THE ACA. OF PEOPLE THAT WILL GET MORE PEOPLE INSURANCE WHICH IS C. E. R. USE GO DOWN I SAID NO NO. ACTUALLY HERE IS WILL GO UP FIRST WHY WHY WHY IS THAT. WE pPROPER CARETO. IS THAT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT. IF YOU WEREN'T INSURED BEFORE. THAT'S WHERE YOU NORMALLY GO YOU DON'T HAVE A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR USE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M SURE CW SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT NOW WHEN YOU GOT SICK NAY OF INSURANCE CARD. HE GOT SICK OKAY WELL WHAT DO I GO. I DO WHAT MY USUAL THING IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO IS INVEST. SOME MONEY IN. TEACHING PEOPLE IN RE DIRECTING THE SHOW FOR THE E. R. WELL. HERE'S YOUR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR YOU SHOULD GO HERE FIRST NEXT TIME ETCETERA TAKE SOME TIME FOR PEOPLE AND IS ALSO BY WE A BACKLOG OF. ON THAT HEALTH NEEDS THAT THEY HAD RIGHT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T SURE DATE. THE LATE GETTING CARE. SO NOW YOU HAVE TO. BUMP UP IN UTILIZATION. AND YOU GO OH WOW YOU NOW TO FAILURE WE GOT PEOPLE MORE COVERAGE IS SUPPOSED TO DECREASE YOUR STATION THE THEY CHRISSY ARGUES INSIDE RIGHT NOW I WENT UP. IS IT WELL THAT'S A TRANSITION PERIOD BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE BACKLOG THEN WE'LL GET TO THE RIGHT PLACE. SO I JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL HOW WE DO THIS WE DON'T TO CREATE SITUATIONS WHERE. YOU KNOW AND FIGURE OUT AND AGAIN I REALIZE SOME OF THIS BECAUSE IT WORKED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOW THE WAIVERS IT CETERA. HOW WE PUT IN SOME BUFFERS THERE TO TAKE. CITY. TO BASICALLY DEAL WITH. YOU KNOW THE THINGS WE DON'T TO. WE'D AS HARD RECANTED. EVERYTHING BUT WE LL KNOW WE CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE AND E DO KNOW THAT OF. ESPECIALLY COMPLEX SYSTEMS OF YOUR EXPECTING PLANS. TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RISK IS. TO DO. FULL AND HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT AND THEN THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO DO SOME AND LOSE SERVICES AND THEN OUR AGO ALSO TO INCLUDE YOUR FULL THEN THE LONG TERM CARE. WELL YOU WE JUST THREW IN THREE VERY BIG MOVING PARTS EVENTUALLY ALL SORTED OUT. DEL FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RATE SHOULD BE YOU'LL FIGURE IT CETERA WILL. GET ACTUAL SOME REAL EXPERIENCE IN ANIMALS OR SETTLE DOWN WHAT IT REALLY SHOULD BE. BUT UNTIL THEN. SOMEBODY'S GONNA GUESS TOO HIGH TO LOW IT CETERA. ON BOTH SIDES AND THEN WE MAY HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE MIGHT NEED TO. BE ABLE TO. TO SO THAT. ANY FISHERIES DON'T GET CAUGHT. IN THAT SITUATION SO. I JUST. YEAH I DESERVE. PUT THAT OUT THERE SERVERS THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. AS WERE ROLLING THROUGH EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING REALLY pPOSSIBLE ESTIMATES AND SO FORTH. THAT WE- GIVE OURSELVES SOME WIGGLE ROOM IF WE CAN. TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE UNEXPECTED- BECAUSE IT AND BECAUSE I WANT THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL I WANT SOMEONE TO SAY OH WE'RE GOING TO. CHARACTERIZE THIS TRANSITION BY. THE THINGS THAT KIND OF WENT. WRONG SO I MEAN WE SELL. I CAN I WILL SHARE MORE EXAMPLES. OF WHAT IT WAS THAT DELAYED THE UNEXPECTED HAPPEN AND SO PEOPLE ARE JUST THAT. WHERE WERE MEETINGS PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THINGS AND REALLY WORK AS WELL TERMS OF THERE'S A FEW OF MOVING PIECES THAT I JUST WANT TO INSURE YES I THINK WE ONE OF THE PEACE THAT WE AGREE WITH YOU 1100% I THINK WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE KNOW IT WILL TAKE TIME. WE SAW THAT THROUGH WHOLE PERSON CARE WHOLE PERSON CARRYING COME UP THEY WANT AMAZING IDEAS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THAT BUT WE REALLY HAVE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED BUT US IN HEARING FROM. THE COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE IMPLEMENTED A IN REGARDS TO WHAT THAT TOOK TO GET UP AND RUNNING IT'S NOT A SHORT RUN WAY IT IS A LONG RUN MINE SO. YOU HAVE SOME A PATIENTS THIS WILL TAKE TIME TO BE WILL WANT PEOPLE TO BE PATIENT WITH US AS WE'RE GETTING IT OUT STATEWIDE ACROSS THE STATE UNFORTUNATELY THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER ENDING WE NEED TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE PATHWAYS. FOR OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS AND SO THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL KIND OF A TIMING OF WHY JANUARY ONE IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THIS PARTICULAR TRANSITION THE OTHER THING I WOULD JUST MENTION IS THAT- IN THE PROPOSAL AND AS SEEN IN THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS- A SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL. INVESTMENT IN FOR INCENTIVES- FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND WE DO PLAN AND WE ARE OUT FOR COMMENT RIGHT NOW ON- IDEAS OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE A REALLY HONING IN ON FOR THOSE INCENTIVES TO REALLY DRIVE. AND BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE STATEWIDE FOR ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES AND HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE ACROSS THE STATE ON TO MOVE THE NEEDLE OVER THOSE TWO YEARS BECAUSE WE KNOW IT WILL TAKE TIME TO BUILD CAPACITY. AND SO WE REALLY WILL LOOK TO THOSE- INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO HELP OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THEN ULTIMATELY DOWN TO THE PROVIDER LEVEL TO BUILD CAPACITY TO EXPAND WORKFORCE ON TO REALLY FEEL GAPS WHERE WE SEE A GAPS WHETHER THAT'S ACCESS TO MORE RETRIBUTIVE CARE BEDS OR TO HESE HOUSING HUBS. OF WHATEVER IT MAY BE A IS A REALLY CRITICAL PART OF THE PROPOSAL FOR TO SEE SUCCESS WE ACTUALLY DID IT THAT WAS A PART OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARES WELL. ON VARIOUS PARTS WHERE IT HAD INCENTIVES BECAUSE THERE ARE YOU DO YOU KIND OF NEED TO BUILD SOME INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY. FIRST AND WE KNOW IT WILL TAKE TIME SO WE NEED WE DON'T. THIS YOU KNOW FALL INTERPRET. THAT ON JANUARY TWENTY TWO ONE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS FABULOUS BENEFITS STATEWIDE. BUT WE DO HOPE TO OVER TIME BUILD IT. USING INCENTIVES TO DRIVE TOWARDS WHAT'S NECESSARY AND WHAT'S NEEDED- AND THEN REALLY CV IN LIEU OF SERVICES BUILT. OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. PLANS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THEM ALL DAY ONE WE KNOW THAT- BUT- AS THE BILL CAPACITY TO BUILD THAT STATEWIDE- WE'RE REALLY HOPING IT CAN FILL IN GAPS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. YEAH I WOULD JUST TELL I MEAN I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT BEING CAUTIOUS SOME INTO. GREAT EXAMPLES. ADDITIONAL SPD RATES WHEN THEY WENT MANDATORY. AN INITIAL M. C. E. RATES WHEN ACA HAPPENED. RIGHT RIGHT OUT. SO I THINK THE NUMBER ONE THE DEPARTMENT IS MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED AROUND RATE SETTING IN THE PLANS OF REALLY YOU KNOW NOTICE THAT. YOU NUMBER TWO THERE IS SOME DATA TO USE AND IN THE CASE OF YOUR MEMBER WITH THE ACA THERE WAS NO DATA RIGHT. TIME WITH THE SPD'S. MISCALCULATION MIGHT BE A TERM THAT CAN BE USED- SO I THINK THERE'S MORE SOPHISTICATION. THERE IS SOME DATA THAT THAT CAN BE USED FROM HEALTH PHONES FROM THE FROM THE WHOLE PERSON CARE. AND SO I THINK. YOU KNOW BUT YOUR POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN. WE WILL HEAR FROM THE PLANS OF THEIR SIGNIFICAN IF THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT. MAYBE NOT OVER PAYMENTS FOR CERTAINLY UNDERPAYMENT SO WE WILL HEAR TO. I DON'T EXPECT THAT OKAY FOR THE QUESTIONS. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU IT'S HAVE YOU HERE WILL BRING UP FOR NEXT PANEL HERE OKAY SO- I'M SURE WILL HAVE THEIR OWN COMMENTS ALL RIGHT SO NEXT PANEL IS ERICA MURRAY PRESIDENCY OF THE CALIFORNIAASSOCIATION PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS- BRAND MARRIED JUNE DS GOVERNMENT FAIRS ADVOCATE FOR S. YEAH YOU. CALIFORNIA CITY COUNCIL BEAU HENNEMAN DAVID RIGHT KAY- DIRECTOR SOCIAL PROGRAMS ANTHEM BLUE CROSS- LEADER COOPS MEN'S- COME AFFAIRS DIRECTOR LOCAL HEALTH PLANS CALIFORNIA AND LINDA- WAY POLICY ADVOCATE FOR WESTERN CENTER LAW POVERTY WELCOME- I ASK IF YOU COULD TRY PLEASE KEEP YOUR REMARKS TO THREE MINUTES I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE MORE TIME FOR MORE DIALOGUE AFTERWARDS. THANK YOU AND WELCOME. THANK YOU. MY NAME'S ERICA MARIE AND THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF CA PH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS WHICH INCLUDES. KERN MEDICAL NATIVIDAD MEDICAL CENTER AND UC DAVIS SELF WE ARE WELL REPRESENTED HERE TODAY. I WOULD SAY ON AVERAGE- PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. SERVE A VERY COMPLEX PATIENT POPULATION IS ALL OF YOU NOW ABOUT HALF OF THEIR PAYER MIXES MEDI CAL AND UNINSURED THE OTHER HALF IS- MEDICARE OFTEN TOOLS AND COMMERCIAL OFTEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. AND BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH MEDI CAL AN UNINSURED CARE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS HAVE LONG RELIED ON SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO TRY TO CLOSE THAT GAP BETWEEN WHAT THE COST OF THE CARE IS AND LOW MEDICAL BASE RATES. AND AS HAS BEEN NOTED THE MOST PROMINENT OF THOSE A LOT OF THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL PAY INTERLOCKING FIFTEEN WAIVERS AND WE NOW HAVE KIND OF A GREATEST HITS OF PROGRAMS THROUGH ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVERS WHICH HAVE SUCCESSFULLY TIED REALLY AMBITIOUS PERFORMANCE TARGETS TO FEDERAL FUNDING WHETHER IT'S LOW INCOME HEALTH PROGRAM. GLOBAL PAYMENT PROGRAM DISTRICT INTO PRIME WE REALLY HAVE- DEVELOP DEEP EXPERTISE IN AND HOW TO DO THAT AND HOW TO SUCCEED IN IMPROVING CARE. AND AS JC HAS NOTED THE- GOVERNMENT HAS FOR CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE A NEW IS SIMILARLY SIZED ELEVEN FIFTEEN LABOR SO FOR PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS WHAT CAL AMY IS THAT WE- HAVING OF ALL FROM A PROVIDE. FOCUSED WAIVER TWO EIGHT LAND GUEST WAIVER AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THAT AND I WOULD SAY OFFER A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY BUT IT'S ALSO FRAUGHT WITH PERIL SO I'LL START WITH THE PERIL. THREE REASONS IT IS NOT TOTALLY CLEAR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REPLACE ART DOES SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS EXACTLY IN A ONE FOR ONE OR IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY- FROM AS YOU GO FROM ELEVEN FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE ANOTHER AUTHORITIES. THIS IS IT'S NOT KNOWING TODAY WHETHER AND NECESSARILY OPTIONAL- OPPORTUNITY THAT PLANS WILL ACTUALLY TAKE IT AND PROVIDED IN A WAY THAT TRULY DOES SUSTAIN THE WORK THAT'S THAT'S GONE ON IN COUNTIES AND WE'RE CERTAINLY. HOPEFUL AND A REALLY APPRECIATE THE INCENTIVES THAT THE STATE IS OFFERING AND HOPE THAT THOSE INCENTIVES ARE STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT. FOCUSES ON WHOLE PERSON CARE SUSTAINABILITY ESPECIALLY SHARED WITH THE PROVIDERS THAT WILL HELP ACHIEVE THOSE PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. THE SECOND REASON FOR CONCERN IS THAT. REALLY SIMPLY PUT THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THAT WE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO MAY NOT ADD UP. I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WE ARE RELIANT ON AND SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS WE CALL DIRECTED PAYMENTS AND THOSE HAVE TO BE FOLDED INTO MANAGED CARE RATES AND WHEN YOU START TO ADD ON. A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ON TOP OF LOW PAYMENTS INTO MANAGED CARE RATES. MORE IN- ACTUARIES AT THE STATE OR FEDERAL LEVEL MAY NOT CERTIFY THAT AS ACTUARY LEE SOUND SO WILL HAVE NEW LIMITATIONS ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THAT WE THAT WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO. AND THE THIRD REASON FOR PERIL IS THE EXTERNAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS WE ARE LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL OF FINALIZATION OF ADD RULE. ON PROPOSED BY CMS THAT WOULD REALLY DECIMATE THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND AS YOU SEE NOTED WE ARE GOING TO BE RELIANT ON THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO RENEW THE GLOBAL PAYMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM. FOR CARE TO THE REMAINING AND SHORT. BUT THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN A REALLY MEANINGFUL WAY WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH CARE PLANS AND WE REALLY. APPRECIATE THAT AND KNOW THAT WE WILL WE WILL ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES TOGETHER. THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE A GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN HELLO SENATOR MY NAME IS AND JDS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF SCA YOU CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL AND ARE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PRIVATE AND PUBLIC WORKERS FIRST I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THE CRITICAL ROLE OF COUNTY PROVIDERS IN THE CURRENT MEDI CAL PROGRAM SECOND I WILL SPEAK ABOUT CAL A MINUTES PRESENT FORM THE OPPORTUNITIES AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AS MYSTERY MENTIONED FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND LASTLY I WILL SHARE SOME CONCERNS- LARGELY WE HAVE ON THE MANAGED CARE AS A WHOLE AND ON THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. SO FIRST THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC COUNTY WORK FIRST YOU KNOW VERY WELL THE SCA YOU REPRESENTS A WIDE RANGE OF WORKERS IN ALL OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ACROSS ALL COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS COUNTY PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND SOME COMMUNITY CLINICS AS WELL OUR COUNTY PUBLIC WORK FOURS ARE LITERALLY SOCIAL WORKERS ELIGIBILITY WORKERS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES EMPLOYMENT SERVICES WORKERS HEALTH CARE CLINICIANS MENTAL HEALTH PSYCHOLOGIST MEDICAL CASE WORKERS AT MANY OTHERS THESE ARE YOUR- THE- EIGHT COUNTY. WORK AND HOW SPENT YEAR IN OFFICE DATE DECADES ON THE STREET AND IN TENSION AND ON THE FRONT LINES HELPING LEAD THE WAY WHEN THE STATE'S FACED EMERGING- CRISIS AS WELL AS NATURAL EMERGENCIES. OUR PUBLIC WORKERS PROVIDE HIGH TOUCH IN PERSON ASSISTANCE AND REAL TIME REFERRALS TO CRITICAL SERVICES LIKE HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. HOW FRESH HOW WORKS GENERAL ASSISTANCE LITERALLY ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT A CLIENT NEEDS AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR- ON THE SECOND WE- WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CALI IMPACTS ON THEIR CURRENT WORK FORCE. CONTEMPLATED BY CAL A IT DOES PROVIDE- SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE AND TRANSFERRED THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES FROM COUNTIES TO MANAGED CARE PLANS. IT'S SIXTY CHANGE LITERALLY HOW COUNTIES FINANCE BUDGET PLAN FOR AND POTENTIALLY THE LIVER HEALTH AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS SHIFTING A GREATER AT AS YOU MENTIONED DOCTOR PAN YOU RESPONSIBILITIES AND FUNDING TO MANAGED CARE PLANS- THIS WERE WILL RELY HEAVILY ON CONTRACTS PERHAPS WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS. BUT ARE NO. IN NO OBLIGATION OUR DATA CONTACT BACK WOULD COUNTIES FOR ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN LIEU OF SERVICES AND OTHER SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN TRADITIONALLY DELIVERED BY THE COUNTIES. WELL WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF- MAKING SOME CHANGES TO THE COW IN PROPOSAL I THINK WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. AS IT. IT IS UNCLEAR TO US- WHETHER THE LEAD ENTITIES FOR THE WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HEALTH HOME PROGRAM WILL BE THE ENTITY THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONTRACT BACK OUT TO. AND ALSO WON A HIGHLIGHT THAT THE BENEFIT THAT IS ACTUALLY BEING CONTINUE THROUGH THE CAL A PROCESS. IS THE INTENSIVE CARE COORDINATION AND NOT YEAH SERVICE DOES THAT HOUSE AND YOU SEE THE PACKAGE THROUGH A I LOW'S ADMIN BUS HOW QUESTION. MANAGED PLAN WILL. READY TO THE TO CASE BY CASE WHAT WHICH I LOW THAT THAT FISHERY WILL BE LA. FOR AND LASTLY WE QUESTION THE NEW ROLE OF MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THE DELIVERY OF YOU HUMAN SERVICES WHICH HAS NOT BEEN HISTORICALLY PART OF THEIR ROLE. AS YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEDI CAL PARTICIPATE FACE TIMELY ACCESS ISSUES AND ALSO SOME MANAGED CARE PLANS- DO NOT HAVE NETWORK ADVOCACY FOR OUR MANY OF OUR CLIENTS TO ME THIS IS A CRISIS THAT THE STATE COUNCIL HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN AND- AS YOU ALSO KNOW THAT. I SEE AB ONE OF OUR LOCALS AS WELL AS OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE A PENDING SUIT AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS THE LARGER MANAGED CARE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE ISSUE. SO WITH THAT SAID I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON ON THE COUCH AIM IN MANAGED CARE. THANK YOU. WELCOME IF YOU'RE NOT DEPEND ON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- BUT WOMEN DIRECTORS SPECIAL PROGRAMS FOR ANTHEM BLUE CROSS THE EXTRA. TO TALK ABOUT OUR OUR INTEREST IN EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE WAIVER I DO SEE THIS IS A IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE WE'VE WORKED THROUGH OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS- DURING THAT TIME WE HAVE IS AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE SET UP THE HEALTH HOMES PROGRAM AND SIX OF OUR COUNTIES. IN SPITE OF OUR COUNTIES WE DEVELOP PARTNER TO THE COUNTIES UNDER WHOLE PERSON CARE AND- REALLY SEEN A LOT OF POSITIVE CHANGE TO THOSE PARTNER IT'S WORKING WITH COUNTIES IN IN A NEW WAY THROUGH. COORDINATION SERVICES DATA EXCHANGE. DURING THE ARE GETTING ACCESS TO THINGS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO BEFORE- WE'VE DONE LONG TERM CARE AND LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IN TWO COUNTIES INCLUDING SNIFF TRANSITION- WORK- AND RELEASED SPENT THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUILDING UP SOME SOME OTHER SERVICES AND PROGRAMS. THAT WILL FALL UNDER IN LIEU OF SERVICES- AROUND HOUSING FOOD AND SECURITY MEDICAL RESPITE A RECOUP OF CARE AND SO FORTH SO I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW GOING INTO THIS WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD STARTING POINT. BUT THIS WILL TAKE UP A LOT OF WORK TO STAND UP AND TO IMPLEMENT STATEWIDE- IS WE WORK TOWARDS TOWARDS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS YOU KNOW IT IS. OUR ANTICIPATION THAT. YOU KNOW WE WILL NEED TO GET YOU WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTIES IN WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS TO FIGURE OUT. FIRST AND MOST HOW TO TRANSITION THE SERVICES OF THE TWO EXISTING PROGRAMS INTO THIS NEW WAVER AND ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO GAPS IN SERVICES. FOR OUR MEMBERS AND THAT THERE'S A SCENE. TRANSITION AND THAT COULD INVOLVE YET YOU KNOW WORKING. WITH DIFFERENT MODELS BASED ON EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES NEEDS IN SOME COUNTIES I DO ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE CONTRACTED DIRECTLY WITH COUNTIES IN. OTHER COUNTIES YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA BE OTHER WAYS TO BUILD A CAPACITY I. IT IT'S NOT BE A ONCE. FITS ALL MODEL THAT WE WORK TOWARDS TOO MANY BUT OUR OUR INTENTION. WORKED THROUGH THAT EVERYTHING BEING PROVIDE. CARE TODAY DOES TURN. IT OVER. AND THEN IT WORKING TOWARDS YOU KNOW WITH THE IN THOSE SERVICES WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BUILDING OUR CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO OFFER ALL THIRTEEN OF THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES. IN ALL OF OUR COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT IT'S JC MENTION. YOU KNOW SINCE. CONCERNS THAT CUP. AROUND THAT I THINK IT IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO. TO BUILD OUT THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES STATEWIDE EVEN IN OUR COUNTIES WERE DOING HEALTH HOMES IN WHOLE PERSON CARE TODAY- I THINK THERE ARE SOME GAPS WITH SOME OF THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES THERE ARE SOME GAPS AROUND THE ENHANCE CASE MANAGEMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK TO BUILD OUT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND- AND MANY OF THE COUNTIES WHERE THERE. THERE HASN'T BEEN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT FOR THESE PROGRAMS- YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE STARTING FROM SCRATCH AND SO IT IS GOING TO TAKE AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND- EVEN IN THOSE COUNTIES IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF- COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AND OUR OTHER COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS SO. IN OVERALL HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ANY QUESTIONS LATER ON WE DO SEE THIS LIKE I SAID IS A VERY POSITIVE- SCENE AND IT'S GOING TO ALLOW US TO EXPAND ON SOME OF THE GOOD WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT DEFINITELY. ANTICIPATE SOME CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY. GOOD AFTERNOON AT CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S ON A COULD MEN'S AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OF CALIFORNIA. FOLLOWING THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM ANTHEM I'D NOW LIKETO GIVE YOU THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SIXTEEN PUBLIC. NONPROFIT HEALTH PLANS. HOW MUCH COLLECTIVELY COVER OVER SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE BENEFICIARIES. SO AS WE'VE HEARD THE GOVERNOR AND DH CS HAVE A BOLD VISION FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF MEDIC HOW. TO REALLY SERVE AS A HUB WHICH CONNECTS BENEFICIARIES TO A FULL CONTINUUM OF SERVICES. LOCAL PLANS ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE CALLIN PROPOSAL AND SEE IT AS A- GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE CARE AND OUTCOMES FOR THE BENEFICIARIES WE SERVE. WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT KELLY MANTRUST HEALTH PLANS WITH INCREASING RESPONSIBILITY. TO DELIVER ON THE VISION AND WE TAKE THIS RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY. SO IS MISSION DRIVEN PLANS ROOTED IN INFORMED BY OUR COMMUNITIES. WE THINK WE HAVE A REALLY STRONG FOUNDATION THAT WILL ENABLE US TO MEET THE OBJECTIVES OF CALLIN. SO TODAY ALL FOCUS MY COMMENTS OF VERY BRIEFLY ON THE TRANSITION OF FULL PERSON CARE AND HEALTH HOMES. AND TO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES. TO LOCAL PLANS REALLY FEEL THAT THERE ARE FOUR CRITICAL ELEMENTS AND TO SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. FIRST STRONG LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS SECOND BUILDING ON EXISTING SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE. THIRD MAXIMIZING INCENTIVES AND THEN FINALLY CONTINUE DH YES LEADERSHIP. SO FIRST WE REALLY BELIEVETHAT RELATIONSHIPS ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS HERE. SHORTLY AFTER THE COUNTY PROPOSAL WAS RELEASED- IN THE FALL LOCAL PLAN STARTED HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR COUNTIES. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING CONVERSATIONS EARLY AND OFTEN AND THINK THAT THIS WILL SET US UP FOR SUCCESSFUL- PLANNING INTO THE TRANSITION INTO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES. SECOND BUILDING FROM EXIST IN EXISTING SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. SO AS WE'VE HEARD EACH PLAN WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT STARTING POINT BASED ON THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND- EXIST IN THEIR COUNTIES TODAY. BUT I THINK THE COMMONALITIES THAT ALL PLANS. REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH WHOLE PERSON KAREN HEALTH HOMES. WILL BE CRITICAL FOR BRINGING THOSE PROVIDERS INTO THEIR NETWORK THROUGH SUCCESS OF THESE. AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY IT LOCAL PLANS DO YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE IN DELIVERING IN LIEU OF TYPE SERVICES TODAY. I'M FOR EXAMPLE KERN HEALTH SYSTEMS TO YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON HAS BEEN FUNDING MEDICAL RESPITE BEDS. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO FOR HOMELESS BENEFICIARIES TRANSITIONING FROM INPATIENT SETTINGS. SO WE THINK THAT IT'S THESE TYPE OF INVESTMENTS THAT WILL REALLY LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR ULTIMATE PROVISION OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES MORE BROADLY. THIRD AND MAXIMIZING INCENTIVES TO EXPAND LOCAL SERVICES SO WE'RE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE INCENTIVE FUNDS INCLUDE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR- AND WE THINK THAT'LL BE CRITICAL FOR BUILDING OUT THE COMMUNITY BASED A LIVERY SYSTEMS THAT WE NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND ALSO IT ULTIMATELY ENABLE PLANTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES SUCH AS TENDENCY SUPPORT ASSISTED LIVING AND HOME MODIFICATIONS JUST TO NAME A FEW. AND THEN FINALLY- CONTINUE DH CS LEADERSHIP WILL BE CRITICAL. SO THIS WILL INCLUDE CLEAR AND TIMELY POLICY GUIDANCE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND RATES WELL IN ADVANCE OF IMPLEMENTATION. WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING ALL OF THESE ISSUES OF THE DEPARTMENT AND UNDERSTAND THE WORK IS UNDER WAY. WE WILL ALSO NEED THE DEPARTMENT TO CAN YOU CONTINUE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO CONCERNS AROUND IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINES. SO THERE ARE NUMEROUS CALLIN PROPOSALS WHICH WILL REQUIRE RESOURCES IN PLANNING AND PARALLEL TO PLANNING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES SO- WE'VE BEEN HAPPY TO SEE THE THOUGHTFUL- ROLLOUT AND FROM. THE DEPARTMENT BY ADJUSTING IMPLEMENTATION DATES AND TIMES THEIR INITIAL OPPOSE ON OCTOBER UNTIL TODAY- AND THEN JUST IN CLOSING I WANT TO RE REITERATE OUR SUPPORT FOR THE KELLY PROPOSAL. AS WELL AS OUR COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS PROVIDERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO. IMPROVE SERVICES NOW COMES FOR A BENEFICIARY SO. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY ANY QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TODAY. THANK YOU WELL GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE SUPPORT THE GOLDEN VISION OF THE CAL AIMED PROPOSAL BUT DO HAVE CONCERNS REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION AS MUCH OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FALLS ON MEDI CAL PLANS WHO HAVE FALLEN SHORT AS OUTLINED IN THE BACKGROUND AS WELL AS RECENT AUDITOR'S REPORT IN ADDITION PLANS ARE ALREADY RESPONSIBLE FOR CARE COORDINATION OF CARVED OUT SERVICES INCLUDING DENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BUT- DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT MEMBERS ARE RECEIVING THESE CARVED OUT SERVICES. THIS RAISES CONCERNS AROUND MEDI CAL PLANS BEING GIVEN ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES AN EXISTING OVERSIGHT TO THE CAL AIM GOAL OF STANDARDIZATION WE'D RECOMMEND KNOCKS KEEP MANDATORY KNOCKS KEEN LICENSURE TO ENSURE THAT ALL MEDI CAL ENROLLEES HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS INCLUDING ACCESS TO AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW AS WELL AS OVERSIGHT BY A REGULAR AT REGULATOR RATHER THAN A PAIR. IN ADDITION WE DO NOT THINK THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE DELEGATING OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS TO A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION BUT OUR PLEASE THAT. OTHER THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSES TO CERTIFY. DELEGATED ENTITIES WERE ALSO PLEASE THE CAL AIM INCLUDES SERVICES TO MEDI CAL ENROLLEES THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY PROVIDED THROUGH THE IN LIEU OF SERVICE PROPOSAL HOWEVER WE'RE CONCERNED THAT AS AN IN LIEU OF SERVICE PLANS HAVE THE OPTION OF WHICH SERVICE TO PROVIDE. AND ARE FINANCIALLY INCENTIVIZED TO FOCUS ON HIGH UTILIZES WHICH MIGHT EXACERBATE HEALTH DISPARITIES. THE HEALTH HOLD PROGRAM WHICH WE SPONSORED PROVIDE HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES AS AN ENTITLEMENT SO ALL IN A ROW LEASE IN PARTICIPATING CLANS WHO QUALIFY ARE ENTITLED TO THIS BENEFIT RATHER THAN AT THE PLANTS DISCRETION. THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSES ENDING THIS AS WELL AS A WHOLE PERSON CARE AND REPLACING IT WITH IN LIEU OF SERVICE WHERE'S WE RECOMMEND MAKING HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICE A STATEWIDE BENEFIT REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT'S CALLED. WE ALSO BELIEVE MEASUREMENTS AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES SHOULDN'T SOLELY BASED ON CALLOUSED SAVINGS OR CLAIMS. AVOID IT BUT MILESTONE SHOULD BE PUT INTO PLACE TO MEASURE THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE AND REALLY SERVE TO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES AT THE CHORE POINTED OUT. WE SUPPORT EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS AND ALSO RECOMMEND AS PART OF THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS OF THE CONTRACT BE OPEN TO STAKEHOLDER INPUT. TO STRENGTHEN MEASUREMENTS OF WHAT PLANS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THESE PROVISIONS. TO THE REMAINING WHAT WE THINK IS 998% NOT COVERED BY THE ENHANCE. CARE MANAGEMENT OF THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY BUT SUCCESS WILL REQUIRE TYING PAYMENTS TO THE EFFORTS TO. REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I QUESTIONS. YES CENTER MONEY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANEL MEMBERS IN THE DEPARTMENT FOR. HELPING BRING US UP TO SPEED- ON ONE DAY ASK MISS WAY ON THE- KNOCKS KEEN QUESTION ROUGHLY HOW MANY PATIENTS ARE COVERED BY KNOCKS KEEN PROTECTIONS OR IF ANYONE KNOWS. OR AT I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER UP WE CAN GET YOU THE NUMBER THAT ARE IN OUR CLOSE IN ON THOSE PLANETS APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION YEAH AND THEN THE FOLLOW UP IS WHAT ARE THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES FOR THOSE PATIENTS. IF THEY'RE NOT PROTECTED BY KNOCKS KEEN. SO FOR- ON THE DEPARTMENT SAID WE STILL HOLD ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLAN- CONTRACTS TO THE SAME EXPECTATIONS IN REGARDS TO WHAT'S IN THEIR CONTRACT THERE IS SOME ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS UNDER THE KNOX KING CLEARLY- BUT THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF THINGS OF NETWORK ADEQUACY IS THE SAME REGARDLESS. OF WHETHER THEY'RE KNOCKS KEEN OR NOT TO THE SAME NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE FOR A TO PLAN OUR LOCAL INITIATIVE- PLAN WOULD ALSO BE THE SAME NETWORK AS C. ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE IN OUR CLOTHES MODEL- AS WELL. ALL OF OUR STANDARD KIND OF TURNAROUND TIMES FOR AUTHORIZATION OR OTHER MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT WOULD BE CONSISTENT ACROSS OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF COURSE WITH THE CLOTHES- I AM MARS AS WAS MENTIONED. EARLIER BUT WE DO HAVE PRETTY CONSISTENT MONITORING ACROSS ALL OF OUR MANAGED CAREPLANS IN REGARDS THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. IN WHEN THERE IS A DENIAL OF SERVICES IS THERE A- AN APPEAL RIGHT. TO THE DEPARTMENT. IF IT'S NOT KNOCKS KEEN. YES SO- WE DO HAVE THE FAIR HEARING PROCESS ON THAT IS IN PLACE- AND- THAT IS AVAILABLE TO BENEFICIARIES FROM THE PEOPLE RIGHT. THANK YOU. A JUST A NOTE ON THE STATE FAIR HEARING THAT THAT IS AVAILABLE TO ALL IN ALL THESE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU'RE NOT SEEN LICENSE OR NOT THAT IS DONE BY AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE NOT NECESSARILY SOMEONE WHO HAS A CLINICAL EXPERTISE. WHAT AM I THINK ALL YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. I GENERALLY AGREE THAT THE PRICE SHOULD HAVE ALL PLANS KNOCKS KEEN SO TO SAY THAT RIGHT UP FRONT- SO FOR THE FOR THE PLANS I GUESS. SO YOU PRIOR TO SO MY QUESTION WITH THE AGENCY EARLIER SO WE GOT A LOT OF MOVING PARTS YOU'RE GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT MORE STUFF RIGHT. SO. SO HOW IS A AND I REALIZE IT'S STILL STILL OF ALL BEING BUT SO WHEN I QUESTIONS ACTUALLY- FIRST EMAIL FOLLOW UP WITH THIS YEAR YOU TERMS OF WHAT IT GIVES NOW YOU HAD SOMEONE THAT YOU HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THE WHOLE TURNOUT ISN'T SO WHAT YOU SEE IS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN YOUR PLAN AND ALL THE SERVICES HERE THAT YOU'LL WELL ACTUALLY BE SUSPECTED TO DELIVER- AND THE COUNTIES WHO ALSO ARE IN CHARGE OF ADMINISTERING. A WHOLE BEVY OF VERY IMPORTANT SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ALSO AFFECTS THE BASICALLY THE SOCIAL TERMS OF HEALTH TO WRITE THAT WHETHER IT'S IN. WELFARE FOOD STAMPS. BUT WE CAN JUST KEEP GOING ON AND ON SO WITH SO HOW HOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE THAT. PLAYING OUT ESPECIALLY SINCE I GUESS YOU'RE NOW RESPONSIBLE RECALL CONTRACTING WITH SOMEONE. COUNTY NONPROFIT OR SOMEONE TO UNLESS YOU PLAN TO DELIVER YOURSELF MINUTE THE THESE THESE SERVICES SOME OF THEM ARE MORE KIND OF MEDICALLY ORIENTED BUT OTHER ONES ARE MORE CERTAINLY LIKE HOUSING THEY THINK. LIKE HOUSING VOUCHERS AND SO FORTH SO HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR ROLE AND HOW DO YOU INTERFACE WITH THE OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES WHICH ARE MAINLY DELIVERED BY. THE COUNTIES OR- THROUGH- PERHAPS- SOME NONPROFITS BUT MAINLY TO COUNTIES. WELL I'LL START AND SO I THINK- BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER A LOT OF THIS WILL GO BACK TODAY INTENSIVE PLANNING THAT- IS OCCURRING AND STARTED SOON AFTER THE PROPOSAL- OF WAS RELEASED. AND AS A PART OF THAT- IT'S REALLY DOING A GAP ANALYSIS LOCALLY TO LOOK AT- YOU KNOW WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE AND BEING PROVIDED TODAY WHETHER THAT'S THE WHOLE PERSON CARE OR HEALTH HOMES. WHAT IN LIEU OF SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED- TODAY AND THEN ENSURING THERE'S CONTINUITY OF THOSE SERVICES UPON THE TRANSITION AND IN JANUARY. AND THEN THINKING THROUGH KIND OF IN THE LONGER TERM WITH THE MENU OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES I KNOW. OUR PLANS ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THEM AND YOU KNOW IN THE LONG TERM WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ALL OF THEM BUT IT'S A IT'S ABOUT CAPACITY INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO IDENTIFYING SORT OF A PLAN FOR BEING ABLE TO BUILD OUT THAT CAPACITY LOCALLY AND THAT'S WHERE THE INCENTIVES INTO PLAY. SITTING UP AGAIN IN TERMS OF THEN YOU TO YOUR QUESTION AROUND HOW DO INTERFACE OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES THAT PLANS. HAVE NOT YOU KNOW ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DON'T DIRECTLY PROVIDE A THINK. ALSO GOES BACK TO CONTRACTING WITH COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS AND THE COUNTIES WHO ARE EXPERT IN THE AND- REALLY HAVE THE KIND OF FACE TO FACE CONTACT WITH THE BENEFITS OR SOMEBODY BASIS. I'M SORRY I THINK AGAIN IT'S GOING TO LOOK. A LOT DIFFERENT FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY EVEN IN THE COUNTIES ORDERS WHOLE PERSON CARE TODAY AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON ON THE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING THAT NOW FIT UNDER THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES BUNDLE OR EVEN THE ENHANCE CARE MAN MANAGEMENT BUNDLE- I DO ANTICIPATE THAT YOU KNOW IN IN SOME COUNTIES. NOR IN OUR INTENT WOULD NOT BE TO DISRUPT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN BUILT- WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND I THINK IN MANY COUNTIES WE WILL BE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE COUNTY TO- TO ADMINISTER THOSE SERVICES THAT THE WAY THAT THEY ARE TODAY WITH THE DIRECT CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY AND I KNOW THAT IN. OTHER CUT SOME COUNTIES WITH ALL PERSON CARE YOU KNOW THE COUNTY MAY NOT WANT TO TAKE ON THAT ROLE IN THE MODELS ARE SO DIFFERENT FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF HEAVY ENGAGEMENT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS TO A TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT RELATIONSHIP LOOKS LIKE. AROUND THOSE IN LIEU OF SERVICES BENEFITS- I THINK BEYOND THAT FOR OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THROUGH SOCIAL SERVICES AND THROUGH THE COUNTIES- YOU KNOW I THINK PART OF THE INTENT OF THIS IS IT JUST THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM DIRECTLY ON THE SERVICES BUT WE'RE WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES TO COORDINATE THOSE OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES AS WELL. AND AS WE WORK TO IDENTIFY YOU KNOW HOW THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTY IS GONNA LOOK NOT JUST WITH. WHO'S PAYING FOR THE IN LUIS MRS BUT HOW DO WE COORDINATE AROUND THESE OTHER SERVICES AGAIN EVERY EVERY COUNTY IS GOING BE DE BECAUSE THINK YOU MAY CASES. SOME OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES BENEFITS THEY'RE NOT JUST LEANS THAT WHOLE PERSON CARE PAID FOR THE COUNTY STARTED DOING THIS AND WE'RE JUST GONNA MOVE IT OVER RIGHT A LOT OF TIME SERVICE THERE IN ONE WITH OTHER MEANS. IS ANOTHER PROBE. AND WITHOUT THE OUT THAT THAT INTENSIVE CORE. COORDINATION STEM FOR STRUCTURE WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY IT'S NOT A WORKED JUST. OVER A IN THE HEALTH PLAN BENEFIT. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE CALL. I THINK I. AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM. MY COLLEAGUES UP HERE TO IT IT WILL DEPEND ON THE COUNTY I'VE HEARD FROM OUR LARGER COUNTIES THAT HAVE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS. SOCIALLY WITH THEIR LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OR- OTHER COMMERCIAL PLANS IN THE AREA THAT. THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES THERE. OBVIOUSLY REPRESENT SMALLER COUNTIES ALSO IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE. THERE IS NO EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PLANS. THERE AND THAT- THAT WE APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT ENGAGING BOTH PLANS AND THE COUNTIES ANOTHER PROVIDERS TO INTENTIONALLY BEGIN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. BUT I THINK FOR US IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN ENCOURAGEMENT AND MORE THAN- INJURY MANAGED CARE PLANS TALK TO THE COUNTY PROVIDERS. FOR US FOR COUNTIES WHERE IT MAKES SENSE TO CONTRACT ABOUT ESSENTIAL OF SOCIAL AND HEALTH SERVICES BACK TO GET THE COUNTIES. BUT ONE THING WE'RE REQUESTING AND FOR THE COUNTIES THAT WAY DOES NOT MAKE SENSE A CONTACT BACK OUT TO COUNTIES LIKE IN SACRAMENTO AND SAN DIEGO. WHAT WE HAVE- ASKED FOR IS TO ENSURE TAT. THE MANAGED CARE PLANS CONTRACT WITH PROVIDERS THAT MEET. LABOR STANDARDS QUALITY STANDARDS AS WELL AS PATIENTSAFETY STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT. MINIMUM THAT THOSE CLIENTS IN THOSE COUNTIES OUR RESEARCH BEING THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE. AND WE'RE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THE VARIANCES IN OUR COUNTIES AS WELL BUT AT THE END OF IT. WHAT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT THAT COUNTY PUBLIC WORK FORCE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE ALREADY DOING INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT. THEY KNOW IN REAL TIME WHAT HOUSING AVAILABILITIES THERE ARE IN A VERY QUICK MANNER AND THEY DO ALL OF THE IN REACH. OUT AND OUTREACH WORK TO THE CURRENT POPULATION AND ALSO TO SOME EXTENT TO THE AT RISK POPULATIONS. SO I GUESS I WOULD NOTE COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS THE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SO ONE IS THAT- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE TYPES OF SERVICES. FIRST OF ALL WHY HERE FROM EIGHT PERHAPS STILL ALMOST CHILDREN COMPLEX NEEDS IS THAT THE SOMETIMES THE PARENTS. THEY WANT THINGS GET- TURNED OUT SO I HAVE TO. I HAVE TO CASE AFTER CASE COORDINATE ALL CASE CORDY HERS RIGHT. AND SO. YOU HAVE. PEOPLE THE COUNTY WHO ARE COORDINATING A SET OF SERVICES AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER SET OF SERVICES HERE- THAT- THEY'RE SITTING UNDER THAT THAT THE- MANAGED CARE PLAN IS IN THE PAYING RELATIONS THE MASTER PLAN OF THE COUNTY ARE WE GONNA HAVE. PLANTS NOW TRYING TO COORDINATE THE CARE COORDINATORS RIGHT I GOT THE SET WITH THIS ONE THE SET AND DAY AND THEY'RE NOT. DEALT SO SOMEPLACE IN THE- BACKGROUND WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT CONNECTS RATE AND THAT THERE'S AN INCENTIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT CONNECTS THE OTHER PART ALSO IS THAT- SO YOU KNOW DISEASE MANAGEMENT WAS REALLY SEXY FOR AWHILE- AND THAT OF THE EIGHTIES. AND WHERE IT FELL APART WAS IS THAT IT- WAS BEING DONE STE AWAY FROM THE FRONT LINES ESSENTIALLY- SO IT WAS BEING. YOU KNOW WAS. A HEALTH PLAN HIRED A FIRM TO DO THIS THAT WAS NOT DID NOT RELATIONSHIP BUT THE PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR. ARE THE ARE THE PROVIDERS THAT THE PATIENT ACTUALLY INTERACTED WITH THE REGULAR BASIS RIGHT SO THERE IS NO TRUST BETWEEN SAY THEY GOT A CALL FROM A NURSING A YOU NEED TO GET YOUR HEMOGLOBIN A. ONE C. OF DIABETES LIKEWHO ARE YOU. WITH MY DOCTOR I'LL LET SARAH SO HOW DO WE MOVE THIS THESE TYPES OF SERVICES IS CLOSE AS WE CAN TO THE FRONT LINES THAT'S THE PROVIDERS THAT'S THE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AT THE COUNTY. WHO ACTUALLY KNOW THAT THIS PERSON IS HOMELESS SO WE WERE PROVIDE. YOU THAT RATE HOW DO WE'D BE SURE THAT WE MOVE THAT DECISION MAKING. TO THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE THE- BEST TOHAVE. NOW THE BEST KNOWLEDGE HAVE THE RELAY. WITH THE PATIENT CLIENT BECAUSE THAT'S THE PERSON SO HOW WE BE SURE THAT HAPPENS AND- SO THAT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL AND DOES. AND BECAUSE AFTER ALL NO THIS IS ABOUT TRUST IS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL AS ABOUT THE SERVICE ITSELF. AND SO I'M THINKING THAT THIS DALE HOW DO WE DESIGN THIS IN A WAY. SO THAT. THIS WILL HAPPEN NOT JUST HOPE IT WILL HAPPEN AND I'M SURE THAT CERTAIN PLANS WILL UNDERSTAND THIS MAKE THIS HAPPEN BUT THAT WE MAKE THIS THE STANDARD OF HOW. WE HOW WE DO THIS AND MAYBE PERHAPS- FROM OUR PUBLIC HOSPITALS YOUR EXPERIENCE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE THE PERSON THAT THAT YOU'RE IN THE FRONT LINES RIGHT YOU YOU WOULD WORK OF PLANS YOU HAVE PATIENTS AT THE OTHER END AND- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE ARE. THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO US AND SEE THIS AS THE- A NECESSITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CARE CONTINUES TO BE. CENTERED AROUND THE PERSON AND NOT SIMPLY IT COORDINATED PROGRAMS YOU COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS. THAT NEED TO HAPPEN AND THE SHARED DECISION MAKING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BETWEEN THE COUNTY PROVIDERS. AND THE PLANS IS EXACTLY AROUND HOW WE LEVERAGE THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER THAT'S HUMAN RESOURCES THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THESE PATIENTS. OR THE BRICKS AND MORTAR ALL OF IT I THINK THE BEST THING WE HAVE GOING FOR US IN THIS MOMENT IS THE VERY FACT THAT. PLANTS ARE BEING ASKED TO DO SO MUCH SO QUICKLY AND THAT THIS THERE AND BECAUSE THERE IS ALREADY EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT NOT EVERYWHERE BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THERE ARE TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS I'M AND LOCAL DIALOGUE AND PEOPLE ARE ALREADY STARTING TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES SO. I'M PERHAPS NOT CONFIDENT BUT HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL- WE WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAY AND- AND- FIND WAYS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO MAKE SURE WE ARE NOT LETTING ANYTHING. SPECIALLY THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PATIENTS WHETHER ON MINE. SO IF I DO NOT. HOW WE'VE- WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND ON THEM IN THE A- IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHEN YOU THINK OF CASE MANAGEMENT THAT'S BEEN DONE TRADITIONALLY MOSTLY BY PLANS TELEPHONIC CASE MANAGEMENT SEPARATED FROM THE DELIVERY SYSTEM THE ABSOLUTE EXPECTATION HERE IS THAT. THESE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES ARE AT THE FRONT LINES THIRTEEN THE PERSON'S HOME BUT THERE IN THE PERSON'S HOME WITH A TRUSTED INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY MAY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH IN THE CLINIC WHERE THERE WERE THEIR SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED WHETHER THAT'S A COUNTY CLINIC AN FQHC OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC WHERE THE MOST TRUSTED RELATIONSHIP. IS BETWEEN THAT PERSON AND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT PLACE THEY ARE NOT MAYBE THE ONLY PLACE THEY'RE GOING AND SO THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF AND HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT IS REALLY DELIVERING IT AT THAT LEVEL WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL IS SO THAT'S IN THEIR PRIMARY CARE SIDE THAT'S IN THERE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE THAT'S IN THERE IF YOU DECIDE THAT IN THE PLACES WHERE THEY ARE. WHETHER THAT'S YOU KNOW I COUNTY CLINIC FEDERALLY QUALIFIED ANSEL CENTER A LARGE PRIVATE PRACTICE THAT HAS THAT RELATIONSHIP SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE TALK ABOUT. IT'S REALLY NOT AN EXPECTATION THAT THE PLAN WILL BE DIRT CORRECT DIRECTLY DELIVERING A LOT OF THIS THERE REALLY IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THE PARTNERING WITH THE ENTITIES AND THE COUNTIES IN THE CLINICS THAT ARE DIRECTLY PROVIDING THE SERVICES TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION BUT THIS ALSO GONNA BE IN THE HOME THIS IS GONNA BE ON THE STREETS. OF THE DEPARTMENTS PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT THOSE EXPECTATIONS IN THE DOCUMENT AND CERTAINLY IN THE WORK GROUPS AND WORK THAT WE'VE DONE- SO EVENTUALLY AND WHATEVER CONTRACTS IN THE FUTURE TOO- YES TOO MANY HEALTH WORKERS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ARE AN ABSOLUTE CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS. AND THE FACT IS THESE MODELS HAVE BEEN DONE ALREADY YES TO HEALTH HOMES THROUGH ALL PERSON CARE. MANDATE I MEAN ODESSA I LIKE GOING OUT SO I MEAN TO THE THINGS THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING- IS PURSUING IS THAT FOR A WHOLE PERSON CARE ENTITIES WE ARE MANDATING THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS- CONTRACT NOW THERE ARE A FEW. EXCEPTIONS TO THAT LIKE IF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE ENTITY DOES NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY CONTRACT BACK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO. WRITER FOR REFUSAL FOR LACK BETTER SCRIPT SHIN BUT ALSO THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN EVEL OF EXPECTATIONS REGARD TO MEETING ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT BECAUSE WHOLE PERSON CARE VERY STATEWIDE- ONE OF THE PIECES THAT THERE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ON THE- THE REQUIREMENTS. OF THE ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT BENEFIT- AND MEET THE QUALITY IN EXPECTATIONS THAT WE PUT ON THE PLANS WE PUT A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS ON THE PLANS AS THEY CLEARLY KNOW. I'M AND THEN THEY HAVE TO PUT THOSE OBLIGAIONS ON TO THEIR CONTRACTED PROVIDERS- SO WE ARE- WE HAVE- PUT THAT FORWARD IN OUR PROPOSAL. THE OTHER THING I WOULD MENTION IS THAT WE DO PLAN ON HAVING IT AND BASED ON A LOT OF FEEDBACK FROM THE WORK GROUP. ON THE STANDARDIZED- CONTRACT TEMPLATE FOR ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT SO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLEAR- AND IT IS VERY TRANSPARENT BETWEEN THE MANAGED CARE PLAN AS WELL AS THE ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT ENTITY. WHAT ARE THE EXCEPTION AT THE EXPECTATIONS OF THIS IS BEING IN THE HOME BEING ON THE STREET. AND IN PERSON. AND IF I MAY JUST AM I THINK GOING BACK TO. YOUR INITIAL QUESTION AROUND- HAVING THESE SERVICES HAPPENED CLOSE TO THE PATIENT AND KIND OF THE DECISION MAKING A CAR THERE. I THINK ONE THING THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS A NEED. I'M THINKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION IS REALLY. WANTING TO BRING THOSE PROVIDERS IN TO OUR NETWORKS- BUT WANTING TO SET THEM UP FOR SUCCESS AND ACKNOWLEDGING THAT A LOT OF TIMES EASIER NONTRADITIONAL. I'M PROVIDERS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN IN MANAGED CARE NETWORKS IN THE PAST. CERTAINLY A LOT OF TRAINING ON SORT OF THE- MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND REQUIREMENTS- JUST. YOU KNOW TO NAME AN EXAMPLE BEING ABLE TO CODE AND SMACK ENCOUNTERS WHICH- AND- AS WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT AT THE LAST A WORK GROUP MEETING IS A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT- SO THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT. HAS WERE THINKING ABOUT PREPARATION- THAT WE REALLY WANT TO ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE PREPARED BUT THAT. WE AND OUR AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROVIDERS OF OCCURS WHILE. SO AT THAT A DO THIS ON A QUESTION OF THE PLANTS AND SERVE TO TELL ON SOMETHING I ASKED EARLIER FOR THE AGENCY SO IN TERMS OF. YOU'RE GONNA BE EXPECTED YOU HAVE IN LIEU SERVICES YOU HAVE YOUNG A- COUNTRY OF LONG TERM CARE WE'RE DOING THE- THE ENHANCED CHAIR OF TERMS YOUR CAPACITY TO. PRICING NEGOTIATED GET THE RATE YOU NEED TO DO THIS WELL IS THAT THE WITH THE DC CHALLENGES WITH DOING THAT. WELL I THINK THE- THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS REALLY THAT THE TIMELINESS RIGHT NOW- I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING HARD ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RATES ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN AND WE'VE BEEN GIVEN SOME TARGET DATES FOR LATER THIS SUMMER I THINK IS EARLY AS AUGUST STIR. RIGHT AUGUST WORKING TO GET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SOON AS POSSIBLE- BUT IT DOES IT DOES RAISE CHALLENGES BECAUSE LIKE LIKE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER WE GET OUR NEW CAPITATED RATE AND WE HAVE TO HAVE OUR ACTUARY SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT OKAY WELL HOW DO WE PUT A VALUE ON THE SERVICES AND HOW DO WE BREAK THAT INTO THE CONTRACTS AND- AND EVEN LOOKING AT OUR OUR EXISTING HEALTH HOMES NETWORK WHICH WILL BE PART OF OUR NETWORK FOR ENHANCE CASE MANAGEMENT. YOU KNOW WE'RE ALREADY HEARING FROM SOME PROVIDERS THAT HEY YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR HEALTH HOMES IT HAS BEEN A HUGE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND IT'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK. BUT WE FIND VALUE IN THIS BUT WE CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS NEW PROGRAM IF WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE RATES ARE GOING TO BE AT LEAST BE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR. AND YOU KNOW AS WE ENGAGE I THINK WITH WITH IN LIEU OF SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER PROVIDERS AND START LOOKING AT HOW DO WE BRING IN- THE WHOLE PERSON CARE NETWORKS INTO THIS ENVIRONMENT. YOU KNOW IT IT PUTS IT A TIE A TIE VERY TIGHT TIME CRUNCH FOR US TO EVEN YOU KNOW GET THOSE INITIAL RATES IN SAY AUGUST AND THEN BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND HAVE CONTRACTS ESTABLISH THE NETWORKS BUILT OUT BY JANUARY FIRST SO I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S DEFINITELY A BIG CONCERN FOR US AT THIS POINT. YEAH THE ONLY THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD ADD IS JUST HAVING CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND WHAT GOES INTO DEVELOPING THE RATE SO. ADDITION TO TIMING KIND OF. WHAT WHAT WHAT'S BEHIND THE RATE. OKAY NOW LIKE I GUESS THE QUESTION OF THE POSE ACT. GIVEN TESTIMONY FROM LESTER CENTER THAT. THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT THEM THAT SOMETIMES THERE ARE SOME PLANS WHO MAY NOT NECESSARILY- PERFORM AS WELL AS WE'D LIKE THEM TO- WHAT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES DO YOU THINK THE- I CAN CERTAINLY ASK THE AGENCY WHAT THEY WOULD DO BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE PLANS THAT YOU COULD DO THAT REASSURE ADVOCATES LIKE THE WESTERN CENTER. THAT WITH THAT- THAT. THAT THAT. THAT BASICALLY WHAT WE'LL GET THE EXPECT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'LL GET THE SERVICES PEOPLE EXPECT SO- WHAT KIND OF- ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES DO YOU THINK. WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO THAT YOU'D SEE THAT SHOULD BE IMPOSED ON YOURSELVES THAT WOULD ASSURE THAT- PATIENTS- WOULD THEY ARE BUT THEY FISHERIES WOULD GET THE SERVICES THAT DAY THAT THEY NEED. AND I'D I THINK IT PROBABLY AT LEAST. AS FAR AS WHERE WE ARE NOW WITH IT- IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AND PLANNING I THINK IT IT PROBABLY IS GOING BACK TO WHAT- WHAT EXPECTED WHAT ARE THE TO FIND EXPECTATIONS AND OUTCOMES OF THE DEPARTMENT IS EXPECTING AND THEN SORT OF FROM THAT WATER THE REQUIRED REPORTING TOOLS ARE METRICS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REPORT BACK UP AND THEN. YOU KNOW TRANSPARENCY AROUND THAT I THINK WERE YOU KNOW IN SUPPORT OF TRANSPARENCY AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO ENSURE OUR PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE ARE ON THE FILLING- THE OBLIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN- WE'VE BEEN TASKED WITH UNDER KELLY I'M SO I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE SPECIFIC METRICS TO SUGGEST AT THIS POINT OTHER THAN- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE NECESSARY PART OF THIS PROCESS AND PART OF TAKING ON NEW RESPONSIBILITIES. YEAH YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE A MULTI TIERED APPROACHES WERE WERE WORKING TO TRANSITION EXISTING SERVICES IN THE BUILD OUT INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE LONG TERM. I THINK YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE DO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION FROM THE OTHER PROGRAMS INTO THIS NEW BENEFIT AND HOW MANY SERVICES. DO WE SUCCESSFULLY- CONTINUE TO EXTEND THROUGH THROUGH THESE NEW BENEFITS IS DEFINITELY CRITICAL I THINK. NO SUGGESTION OF YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE ENGAGE IN AND ROLLING AND ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT MORE DOOR NETWORKS LOOK LIKE I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S THINGS THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE BROADER CAPACITY IN WHICH- YOU KNOW FOR SOME OF THESE SERVICES IT'S YOU KNOW EVEN WITH YOU KNOW THE HOUSE YOU KNOW THE RECORD OF CARE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE IF WE GO INTO A COUNTY WHERE THERE'S NO SERVICES THAT EXIST. IT'S NOT GONNA BE A MATTER OF WE GO THERE AND SIX MONTHS LATER WE'VE GOT A PROVIDER IT'S GOING TO BE A MULTI YEAR PROCESS AND SO I THINK. YOU KNOW PART OF THE OVERSIGHT HAS TO BE LOOKING AT WHAT WE'RE DOING TO ENGAGE WITH OUR OUR COUNTIES IN WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY PROVIDERS TO. INSURE THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO BUILD OUT THAT CAPACITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PROVIDE ALL THE SERVICES. ACTUALLY ANY COMMENTS. NEW AND MAKE. THE. EASY SO IT'S- CERTAINLY INTERESTING TO HEAR- FROM FROM LH PC'S SIDE THE WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IS THAT THEY'D LIKE GREATER. OVERSIGHT FROM FROM THE PLANS IS WHAT I HEARD IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS THAT ARE BEING MEASURED AND SO TO ME- BECAUSE THERE ARE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ALREADY IN PLACE THAT AREN'T BEING MET- TO THAT THE THAT TO ME MEANS GREATER ACTUAL ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS- WHICH- IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING TO DO MORE OF AND TO APPRECIATE WITH THE INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL. BUT I THINK THERE ALSO HAS TO BE A- A PLAN- IT- THE- LEADING THE WHOLE POINT OF THE CAL AIM AS WELL AS TO THE RECOGNITION THAT- BETTER SERVING PATIENTS- AND I DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT COST RAVERS NECESSARILY WILL BUT BUT THAT THAT. AS POINTED OUT- THIS WILL BENEFIT- IN IN THE LONG RUN AND SO TAKING THAT GOT APPROACH MORE- BUT- IF THE PLANS ARE LOOKING FOR GREATER MEASUREMENTS AND- ENFORCEMENT WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOME SOME THOUGHT. OKAY THE BILL I THINK YOU KNOW WITH THE NEW PROGRAM YOU START WITH PROCESS MEASURE SOMETHING YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THINGS ABOUT TAKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF. YOU LOOK AT TRANSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS BEING SERVED NOW MOVE OVER YOU LOOK AT NEW ENROLLMENT YOU LOOK AT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY BEING SERVED. YOU HAVE TO GET THE OUTCOME MEASURES EVENTUALLY THEY'RE NOT JUST FINANCIAL OUTCOME MEASURES THERE ARE MEASURES THAT LOOK AT DID YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH THAT PERSON THE REALITY OF THAT THAT TAKES TIME I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT A HOUSING PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE. YOU HAVE TO STABILIZE A PERSON IN THE HOUSING YOU MADE THE POINT THAT OFTEN YOU THEN GET UNMET NEED THAT COMES OUT IT'S ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU NOW HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING MORE. YOU KNOW MEDICATIONS TO YOUR PROVIDING MORE PRIMARY CARE VISITS MORE SPECIALTY VISITS IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO REALLY SEE ANY OUTCOME MEASURES THAT ARE CERTAINLY BASED ON YOU KNOW BETTER HEALTH STATUS OF THE MEMBER. SO I THINK WOULD REALLY BE STARTING AROUND PROCESS. AND I THINK YOU KNOW BOTH BOWS POINT ABOUT. THERE IS THERE IS THAT HAVE. YOU KNOW NO CAPACITY AT THE MOMENT SO THE- THE PROCESS MEASURES. DEVELOPING CAPACITY. SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING OUT INITIAL. BUT CERTAINLY I THINK DEAL WITH THAT PART OF IT IS TRYING TO SET. EXPECTATIONS INCLUDE CLINICS THAT EXPECTATIONS THAT'S WHY WE HAD THE WHOLE DIALOGUE ALSO ABOUT LIKE. WHAT WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN DURING THE TRANSITION MAY NOT BE. NECESSARY THE SAME AS WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL HAPPEN AT THE END GOAL BECAUSE IT IS A TRANSITION AND SO THINGS HAPPENED DURING TRANSITIONS AND ALSO HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY OR TO CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH. UNEXPECTED THINGS AS WELL BECAUSE AS MUCH AS WE MIGHT PREDICT UNTIL WE ACTUALLY TRY IT SOME THINGS DON'T ALWAYS TURN OUT THE WAY WE INITIALLY PROJECT SO- BE SURE WE BILL THE LITTLE IN THERE FOR THAT AS WELL. YES I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS ON- CAPACITY AND LACK THERE OF AND- THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE BROUGHT UP AROUND WORK FORCE. SCA YOU HAVE SEPARATE BUDGET AND LEGISLATIVE ASK AROUND TRYING TO THINK. REALLY CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW WE BUILD UP OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PROVIDERS AND ALSO OUR EXISTING SOCIAL SERVICES WORKERS YOU'LL SEE OUR BUDGET LETTER ON THOSE- TOPICS BUT THEY'RE ALL. ALL INTERRELATED AND WITHIN THE CAO AIMS SPACE WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL I SEEING THE SPACE WEATHER THROUGH PEER CERTIFICATION ARE ACTUAL. LICENSING AND SO FOR US THAT'S- ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THE PLANTS CAN'T PROVIDE SERVICES OR TO COUNTIES CAN'T PROVIDE SERVICES IF WE DON'T HAVE ACTUALLY ADVOCATE WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. AND SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AND ALSO THAT. TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY OF CERTIFICATION AND LICENSING AND ALSO INVESTING ADDITIONAL MONIES FOR THAT WORK FORCE PIECE. AND THEN- ONE OTHER QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE ENHANCE THE CARE MANAGEMENT BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT WELL THAT'S 1% SINCE THE BEGINNING OF A REALIZE THAT CENTER RIGHT BUT BASICALLY. AT SO- SO I'M ASSETS CERTAINLY THE A UNDERSTAND MAKES CONCENTRATE ON THE ALL THAT THE MOST CHALLENGING AND OFTENTIMES MOST EXPENSIVE. THAT SWEAR LOG. AND HOW DO YOU SEE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING UNDER ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. PERHAPS THAT AND BEING. AVAILABLE MAYBE NOT THE RIGHT WORD BUT THEN INFORMING AND THEN THAT ALSO DEVELOP A SERVICES FOR THE REMAINING POPULATION THAT ACCOUNT RIGHT SO RIGHT. SO YES I KNOW THIS IS THE GROUP THAT NEEDS IT THE MOST AND WE ALSO HAVE AND NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT MONEY TO BUT IT'S BOTH THE IMPROVED REYES OPTING FOR QUALITY AND THE COOK BUT IS ALSO BASS OPTING FOR SAVINGS AS WELL. BUT THEN AS WE ARE ROLLING THIS OUT WE'RE DEVELOPING THE EXPERIENCE AND SO FORTH SO- AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE I SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS NEEDS NOT. BUT SINCE THAT PERSON YET MIKE THIS THIS AND THIS CAN I GET ONE OF THOSE FOR THIS THAT WOULD HELP THAT PERSONALIZE A WHAT WHAT DO WHAT DO YOU SEE- AND IT AND AGAIN YEAH I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS INTERFACES WITH WITH THE WITH THE WAIVER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO AND YOU FRY HAVE NOTHING IT'S JUST ROUGHLY A ROLL OUT THIS PART BUT I DID AT THE BT YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY IT WILL GO AGO- WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ABOUT. NOW I HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S PRETTY YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT THAT 95% THERE AT THE 90% BASED OFF A LOT OF NEEDS NOT AS MUCH. BUT AND MAYBE THEY GOT ONE OF THESE IN LIEU SERVICES DATE COULD THAT BE REALLY REALLY HELPFUL FOR THEM THEY DON'T NEED. THREE OF THEM ARE FIVE OF THEM AT THAT THEN YOU SAY WELL BUT YOU'RE NOT IN THE IN HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT DO YOU THE SO WHAT WHAT HOW. HOW HOW DO YOU SEE THIS. THERE'S A PIECE IT BEING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T TALK A LOT ABOUT TODAY BUT IS IN CAL MS ARE. HEALTH ME. STRATEGY SEES SO WE WILL REQUIRE THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ANNUALLY SUBMIT TO THE DEPARTMENT. I'M NOW STARTING JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO STAGGER BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE I HAVE A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS OR MANAGED CARE PLANS- BUT- THAT THAT THE SUBMIT TO US AN ANNUAL POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY WITH. IN THAT STRATEGY THERE ARE A VARIETY OF COMPONENTS OF WHICH WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT. ONE IS RESTRAINED EDUCATION AND LOOKING AT HOW DO WE IDENTIFY WITH IN OUR POPULATIONS THOSE WHO ARE. LOW RISK- THOSE WHO ARE MEDIUM ARE RISING RISK AND THEN THOSE OR WHO ARE HIGH RISK. I'M AND THEN THOSE WHO HAVE NO DATA IN ORDER FOR US NOT TO KNOW KIND OF WHAT AND THEN WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT PLANS DO AFTER THAT. THIS KIND OF THREE FOUR KIND OF MAIN PIECES OF OUR POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT IS ON THE BACKBONE OF THE NCQA REQUIREMENTS TO COMPLEMENT. OF THOSE PIECES BUT IT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH STARTING WITH THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN MY ON THE SERVICES OF. MANAGED CARE PLANS THROUGH THAT POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY THIS GETS TO THE- NINETY NINE OR NINETY EIGHT YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON WHICH- PERCENT OF PEOPLE. HOW ARE YOU MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE GETTING PREVENTIVE SERVICES THEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TELLING US HOW YOUR MONITORING THAT. ADDITION TO OUR REQUIREMENTS THAT MOVIE ROLL OUT FOR THE AUDIT PROCESS. BUT THAT IS A CORE COMPONENT OF HOW ARE YOU KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY HOW YOU BEING PREVENTATIVE. ARE YOU PUTTING IN EARLY INTERVENTION SO THAT'S ONE COMPONENT. THE OTHER IS IDENTIFYING RISKY NEEDS OF. USING DATA TO DRIVE AND IDENTIFY RISKY NEED RATHER THROUGH MORE COMPLEX READ AVERAGE STRATIFICATION PROCESS SEES- USING OUR TIERED APPROACH- AND THEN BEING ABLE TO SAY OKAY TO DATE WE HAVE THIS DIAGRAM THAT WE USE IN OUR WORK GROUPS WHERE- WE HAVE THE BOTTOM. OF THE DIAGRAM IT HAS LIKE PRIMARY CARE SPECIALTY. HOW EXCEPT. BUT ALSO ALREADY HAVE TOOL WITH MAN CARE LIKE THE MAY. LIKE YOUR GINNY END. YOU KNOW CASE MANAGEMENT CLICKS CASE MANAGEMENT I THINK AS WE BUILD OUT POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT AS WE BUILD UP AND HAND YOUR MEN. IT START STRATIFIED POPULATION INTO PURPOSE POCKETS. HERE AND- HEALTH. MANAGEMENT NEEDS KIND OF JUST PREVENTIVE SERVICES REGULAR OUTRAGE MEMBER ENGAGEMENT NEWSLETTERS ETCETERA. WHO NEED SOME CASE MANAGEMENT. WHO MEETS THE HIGHER LEVEL COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT HIGHER TOUCH. BUT NOT NECESSARILY ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT OVER TIME MANAGING THOSE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. THROUGH RICH STRATIFICATION BETTER DATA ANALYTICS AND PREDICTIVE MODELING WE ARE HOPING THAT OVER TIME WE CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE- ARE I. ABLE TO IDENTIFY FUTURE GAPS AND THEN BRING SOLUTIONS TO THOSE GAPS WHAT WHATEVER THEY MAY BE. A BUT WE REALLY FEEL LIKE THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. IS IT IS THE FOUNDATION AND THAT ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF KIND OF TUCKED UNDERNEATH THAT. THERE'S TWO OTHER COMPONENTS THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY ONE IS IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING SOCIAL DETERMINES OF HELP WHICH WE FEEL LIKE. THE LIEU OF SERVICES PACKAGE HELPS BRING- BUT THAT'S JUST ONE COMPONENT OF THAT. ON SO WE WILL BE REQUIRING THAT ARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ON THROUGH PROVIDERS IDENTIFIED SOCIAL THE TERMS OF HEALTH AND REPORT THAT TO ICD TEN DATA TO THE DEPARTMENT. WE'VE SEEN. A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH THIS AND OTHER STATES. REALLY DO A GOOD JOB OF IDENTIFYING THAT THE MORE DATA THAT WE HAVE THE MORE HOT SPOTTING AND OTHER ANALYTICS WE CAN LOOK AT TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITY STATEWIDE. A FOR FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN THE PROGRAM. AND THE LAST BUT DEFINITELY NOT THE LEAST IS WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB AT TRANSITIONS ACROSS CARE. ON BOTH BETWEEN TRANSITIONS ACROSS OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS AS WELL AS WITHIN A DELIVERY SYSTEMS OF AN IN PATIENT DOES CHARGE A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY DISCHARGED. AND ALL OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE CURRENTLY LAID OUT IN OUR POPULATION HEALTH. PROPOSAL ON THOSE PIECES WILL TAKE TIME TO ROLLOUT BUT THAT WE REALLY FEEL LIKE IT IS ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONAL PIECES. TO BUILD ECM AND OVER TIME UP THROUGH THE PIECES THAT I JUST MENTIONED WE WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND GAPS TO FILL. SO IT TO. PUT IN WHAT ONE COULD ARGUE AND I THINK LINDA'S POINTS IN MJ'S POINTS ARE ARE LEGITIMATE ABOUT. CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW NOT EVERYTHING BEING DELIVERED THE WAY IT SHOULD. THE PLANS RESPONSIBLE FOR A 100% OF THE POPULATION. AND SO. EVEN AS I THINK ABOUT ECM THAT'S PART OF A CONTINUUM OF CARE COORDINATOR XIN BASIC CARE MAY. THERE TO TERMS YOU CAN USE THAT. COMPLEX AND ANY CM I MEAN. TO IDENTIFYING MEMBERS NEEDS IS A IS A CORE PART OF HEALTH PLANS AND- MULTIPLE OPENS ARE INSECURE ACCREDITED THEY ALREADY HAVE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. ONE COULD ARGUE THAT YOU SHOULD DO POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT WELL FIRST AND THEN BACK IN BUT IT'S REALLY A TIMING ISSUE BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FOR ALL PERSON CARE. TO SOME EXTENT HEALTH HOMES INTO THE ECM PROGRAM DELIVER THE IOS. AND ADDING POPULATION OF MANAGEMENT ON TOP OF THAT FOR HEALTH PLANS WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT. SO YOU KNOW THE DECISION WAS MADE TO DELAY THAT A YEAR BUT THE REALITY IS PLANTS ARE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS THEY'RE GONNA TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE THEIR MEMBERS. LAND TO YOUR POINT OF YES THIS GROUP IS INELIGIBLE AND FITS THE CRITERIA FOR AND HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT WELL WE JUST FOUND THIS OTHER MEMBER THROUGH OUR PROCESS. THAT IS GOING TO NEED HELP AS WELL SO EXPECTATION IS THIRD ANGER HUNDREDS OF THE PEOPLE THERE'S A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON IN HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAM THE ROLLING. SO JUST TO CLARIFY IS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND DOING FEEL POPULATION MANAGEMENT AND SO FORTH IN SAID IRRESPONSIBLE AND PERCENT OF POPULATION- EVENTUALLY I MEAN AS YOU DO REST RATIFICATION. RIGHT YOU GOING OKAY WE GOT THE HIGHEST RISK WE GOT THE NEXT HIGHEST RISK AND SO FORTH. DO YOU SEE SOME OF THE ECM. SERVICES BEING AVAILABLE TO RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TARGETING THE HIGHEST RISK TO SOME OF THE LOWER RISK YOU COULD. BE THAT IS THE USE DESERVE GONNA BE A BARRIER TO DOING THAT OR DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING EVENTUALLY. AS A PROVIDE PLAZA PROVIDING RECOUP PART OF CARE RIGHT NOW OKAY IN THAT GROUP OF CARE IS FOR. A PATIENT THAT I MAKE SENSE FOR THE TECH AND ACUTE CARE FACILITY RIGHT SO AS LONG AS IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM THERE'S NO BARRIER TO. FOR IBM IS A SPECIFIC SET OF CRITERIA OF A POPULATION. BUT NOW IT IT'S OUR EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT. A PERSON NEEDING RECOVERED OF CARE IS A PERSON IS OKAY I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE IN TERMS OF THE WAIVERS OR WHATEVER ELSE THAT YOU HAVE TO APPLY FOR THAT WOULD TREATING RESTRICTIONS FOR SO IF IT'S IN THE PROPOSAL THAT'S FOR WE HAVE AS ECM AND- THIS IS THE GREATER VCM YOU FALL OUTSIDE THIS CRITERIA AND THE DEPENDING HOW TIGHT THE CRITERIA WRITTEN. SO I JUST THAT'S WHAT JUST CHECKING ON BIKE SO. WE I MEAN WE ARE TRYING TO WE ARE TRYING TO STRIKE THE BALANCE OF STANDARDIZATION OR- A STATEWIDE. BUT ALLOWING FLEXIBILITY FOR PLANS TO MAKE% DECISIONS ON WHITE BREAD WAS MENTIONING. BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HAVE GENERAL CRITERIA THE COMPLEXITY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ELEVATING THE- ELIGIBILITY OF WHO SHOULD BE GETTING THIS TYPE OF BENEFIT. PLANS ARE REALLY GOOD HAVE TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL IN FRONT OF THEM. AND WHAT'S THE BEST. IS IT ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IS IT JUST COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT. AND MAKE THE DECISIONS BASED ON THE CASES. OKAY SO THERE'S THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT THEN AND WHATEVER WAIVERS WE'RE GONNA DO. FUTURE YEAH FROM THE WAIVER POINT OF VIEW WE WILL DEFINE THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WHICH WE HAVE BEEN VETTING TO KIND OF DEFINE TO CMS. HERE'S WHO WE THINK WE SHOULD BE GETTING THIS-THIS TYPE OF BENEFIT. IN THE FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR WHO GETS IT. SIMILAR TO BUT SOBRE DIFFERENT. TCM TYPE SERVICES WE HAVE A CLEAR DEFINITION OF AN ELIGIBLE POPULATION. THE TYPES OF SERVICES THEY SHOULD BE GETTING- AND THEN THAT'S HOW YOU'D BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. WELL YOU SO VERY MUCH ONLY FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND- THERE'S A LOT MORE I THINK THIS IS JUST- OVERVIEW. CELL WE A LOT MORE WE CAN GET INTO AND THERE'S A LOT. GOING ON SO THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH. OKAY OF NOW. GO AHEAD WE'RE GOING TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT SO. IN THANK YOU- SO IF YOU CAN INTRODUCE YOURSELF NAME ORGANIZATION AND THEY DO ASK IF YOU CAN TRY PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO A MINUTE. OR LESS AND IF YOU HAVE DDITIONAL MATERIALS PLEASE SUBMIT TO THE SERGEANT WHO CAN THEN GIVE IT. WILL GIVE IT TO THE COMMITTEE SO. FEEL FREE TO ALSO PROVIDE WRITTEN MATERIAL OR REFERENCES- TO OUR COMMITTEE AS WELL SO. THANK YOU WELCOME THIS IDEA IN. ARNOLD TOUR IS REPRESENTING THE CENTER BECAUSE HEALTH NETWORK- INCLUDES THE TO THE LARGEST- HEALTH CENTERS. REPRESENTING IN SERVING FARMWORKERS AND MONTEREY WHICH IS THE FIFTH LARGEST AND INVENTOR COUNTY WHICH IS THE- NUMBER ONE. DELIVER OF CARE TO FARMWORKERS POPULATIONS. I THINK YOU'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND REYES SEEN A NUMBER OF ISSUES. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT STEP AWAY FROM THE RESERVATIONS THAT YOU HAVE. I THINK MISTER GILBERT AND THE MEDICARE- MEDICARE ALL DIRECTOR ARE. VERY WELL INTENTIONED. BUT I WOULD SAY YOU HAVE SOME VERY FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS HERE IS A BINDER THAT HAS NINE STUDIES. ON THE LACK OF SHORTAGES OF DOCTORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY DON'T EVEN ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CULTURAL LINGUISTIC COMPETENCY YOU RAISE THAT ISSUE TODAY ABOUT INTERPRETERS. VERSUS TRANSLATORS. THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR SAID THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE THAT THEY WOULD GIVE ATTENTION TO. THAT CAN BE. AN ISSUE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ATTENTION TO. THAT HAS TO BE ABOUT NETWORK ADEQUACY THAT HAS TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT. THAT HAS TO BE A DELIVERABLE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT EXPECTATIONS ANYMORE MISTER CHAIRMAN. THIS IS ABOUT A PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS THAT HAS A NUMBER OF CAPS AND A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS.

MISTER CHAIR SENATOR MONEY- CURSING AT THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. SEEN A HOUSE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS REGARDING CAL AIM WHICH I'D LIKE TO QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT HERE. TRY TO KEEP THIS UNDER ONE MINUTE. REGARDING THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL SEE NAY BELIEVES DH CS TO DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED RISK STRATIFICATION ALGORITHM. AND IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE RACIALLY BIASED. AND TO EXCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WITH GENDER UP WITH GREATER HEALTH NEEDS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. IDENTIFIED BY RESPECT OCCASION OUR pRESTORE APPLICATION ME RATE REALLOCATE THE APPORTIONMENT OF BENEFITS UNFAIRLY. SUCH THAT THIS ADVANCED SUBGROUP. OF BECOMES FURTHER DISADVANTAGED- THIS IS PARTICULARLY LIKELY WHEN A CHARACTERISTIC USE FOR RESTRAINTS VACATION IS A SIGNIFICANTLY- HOURS A SIGNIFIER ACTION I SEE A PREVIOUS DISADVANTAGED OR VULNERABILITIES SUCH AS RACE ETHNICITY. INCOME GENDER HOMELESSNESS EDUCATIONAL STATUS OR PRIOR INCARCERATION. THE PROPOSAL INDICATES THE DEPARTMENT WILL COME WE CURRENTLY USE THE RESTORE APPLICATION. FOR REPORTING PURPOSES ONLY. BUT SEE AN NAY IS CONCERNED THIS COULD CHANGE AND MANAGED CARE PLANS COULD BE PAID AT DIFFERENT RATES. DEPENDING ON RESPECT OCCASION CATEGORIES. IF SO WE ARE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT PLANS GAMING THE SYSTEM TO INCREASE PROFITS. AND CUT BACK ON CARE. CNA BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD REQUIRE ROBUST MONITORING. AUDITS AND FINES.

THAT FAMILY CARE GIVERS GET CARE GIVERS RECEIVE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE HOW THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION COULD WORK WITH AND SUPPORT THE FAMILY CARE GIVERS OWN NEEDS.
