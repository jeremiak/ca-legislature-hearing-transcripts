THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT SB THREE NINETY FIVE- LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT I'M GONNA ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED ON PAGE THIRTY THIRTEEN OF THE ANALISIS AND I. THANK YOU FOR THOSE THANK YOU MEMBERS AS YOU ALL KNOW A TERRIBLE EPIDEMIC HAS PLAGUED OUR YOUTH AND OUR COMMUNITIES FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND IF LEFT UNCHECKED WILL CONTINUE TO DO HARM. TO DO HARM FOR MANY GENERATIONS TO COME ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES OR VAPE PRODUCTS CONTAIN HARMFUL COMBINATION OF NICOTINE FLAVORS AND OTHER CHEMICAL ADDITIVES ALTHOUGH THEY ARE CURRENTLY TAXED AS OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE OTP THE TAX RATE IS MUCH LOWER THAN THAT OF TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO THE GROWING DISPARITY BETWEEN THESE PRODUCTS AND UNDERMINING EFFORTS TO CURB VAPING THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO CREATE PARITY BETWEEN THESE PRODUCTS. VAPING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR DESPITE THE HIGH RISK OF ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES THIS IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC AMONG OUR YOUTH ACCORDING TO THE CDC'S NATIONAL YOUTH TOBACCO SURVEY NEARLY 20% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED CURRENT E. CIGARETTE USE AND ABOUT 40% REPORTED HEAVY USE OF E. CIGARETTES. AND IT HAS YOU KNOW THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF NICOTINE ADDICTION IS- PARTICULARLY SEVERE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE LEADING TO A FEELING OF NERVOUSNESS IRRITABILITY DEPRESSION AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH SIDE EFFECTS. WHAT THE INITIALLY THE AVAIL OF YOUTH APPEALING FAVE FLAVORS SUCH AS GUMMY BEARS AND COTTON CANDY ALONG WITH HEAVY MARKETING HAS IN LARGE PART CONTRIBUTED. TO THAT THIS TREND TOBACCO RETAILERS ARE MORE PREVALENT IN THE POOREST MOST MOST ETHNICALLY DENSE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH INCLUDESPOPULATIONS MOST AT RISK OF INADEQUATE HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND COVERAGE. THAT IS WHY I HAVE INTRODUCED SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FIVE WHICH PROPOSES CLOSER TAX PARITY BETWEEN THE SALE OF BAIT AND TRADITIONAL TOBACCO PRODUCTS. PROCEEDS OF THE REVENUE GENERATED GO TOWARDS EXISTING VOTER APPROVED SOURCES INCLUDING EARLY CHILDHOOD SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. FUNDING FOR PHYSICIAN STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WORKING IN OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS COMMUNITIES. AND NOW THEY TO INCLUDE SEISMIC SAFETY FOR OUR SMALL HOSPITALS WITHOUT IT WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESSES KATE ROBERT WHO'S THE YOUTH ADVOCATE WITH THE SAN BENITO YOUTH ASSOCIATION.

WILBUR AND SHANNON- BECAUSE LOVE IT SO- BEFORE WE GET TO OUR- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT PLEASE. THEIR LIVES ARE BETTER. PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON- MISTER CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATE WEBER AND I'M THE CHAIR OF THE STATE AND YOU KNOW YOU THE POSITION. FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON PASSING LEGISLATION AND EDUCATING OUR COMMUNITY ON THE DANGERS OF UNDERAGE TOBACCO USAGE. SEEING MY FELLOW STUDENTS VAPING IN SCHOOL BATHROOMS. AND WALKINGPAST YOUR POTS ON MY STREET WE'RE BOTH HUGE WAKE UP CALL YOU JUST HAVE TO CREATE THE PROBLEM IS. BOTH MY COMMUNITY AND STATE. BEIJING IS NOT AN ISSUE AMADOR COUNTY IT'S A NATIONAL. THAT EXISTS. AFFECTING THE- YOUNG USERS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BECOME LIFELONG TOBACCO USERS BUT MORE SEVERE ADDICTION ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION. AND THEY COULD NOT GO TO GAIN ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND USING BASED PRODUCTS TO TARGET AND HER KIDS AT AN EARLIER AGE WHEN THEY'RE MOST VULNERABLE. AND UNFORTUNATELY THEIR PREDATORY TACTICS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. BIG PRODUCTS ARE MORE POPULAR AMONGST USE THAN ANY OTHER AGE GROUP. PARTICULARLY DUE TO TWENTY ADVERTISING AND FLAVORS. DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO SKYROCKETED AMID THE PANDEMIC HIGH LEVELS OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND ISOLATION HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO KEEP BASIC. PRODUCTS ARE ALSO NOW MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN EVER WITH ONLINE RETAILING THAT'S WHY SB THREE NINETY FIVE IS STILL ESSENTIAL. THE ADDED TAX WOULD HELP DISCOURAGE YOUNG READERS AND MAKE A LEFT TURN OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS I THINK THAT THE BILL MEANWHILE THE PROCEEDS GO TO ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND HEALTH EDUCATION. THE STATE HAS TO TAKE STEPS IMMEDIATELY PROTECT YOU FROM LIKE TIMES OF SUFFERING AND STRUGGLE. IT'S LEGISLATION LIKE THIS THAT COULD HAVE SAVED MY COUSIN FROM ADDICTION AND BEING KICKED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. SB THREE NINETY FIVE SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA USED AND WOULD HELP PREVENT THEM FROM MAKING NEGATIVE CHOICES TO HAVE PERMANENT CONSEQUENCES. PLEASE JOIN ME IN THIS FIGHT FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FUTURES WITH YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE MOVING NOW ONTO OUR OUR NEXT- PRIMARY WITNESSES SUPPORT. YOUR CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM DOCTOR SHANNON CARP WHICH SHE HER HERS PRONOUNS AND THAT DOCTOR ADMIN SIGN. I'M NOT A MEDICAL PHYSICIAN. I'M A PROGRAM MANAGER EQUALITY CALIFORNIA THE NATION'S LARGEST STATE BASED LGBTQ PORTABLE RIGHT ORGANIZATION MY RESEARCH CURRENTLY FOCUSES ON TOBACCO USE WITHIN THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY I AM HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS AT THE THREE NINETY FIVE AND TO SHARE HOW THIS BILL WILL BENEFIT MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS BILL WILL ADD AN ADDITIONAL RETAIL TACKED ONTO ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS BASED PRODUCTS. TOBACCO USE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE PREMATURE DEATH AMONG LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER AND QUEER FOR LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE. IT IS ALSO THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE PREMATURE DEATH FOR ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD. VAPING IS TOBACCO USE LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE RE UP TO FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY TO USE TOBACCO PRODUCTS AT THEIR SAYS GENDER ST PIERCE. THE TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA STUDENT TOBACCO USE SURVEYS SHOW THAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS STILL USE TOBACCO PRODUCTS. GREAT PRODUCT SPECIFICALLY IN A YEAR WHEN MANY SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED AND A GLOBAL PANDEMIC MADE ACCESS TO THE PRODUCT A BIT MORE DIFFICULT. IN THIS SURVEY WE SAW THAT CALIFORNIA'S LGBTQ PLUS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS NEWSDAY PRODUCTS AT HIGHER RATES THAN THEIR PEERS PARTICULARLY ARE GENDER NONCONFORMING CUTTEN GENDER NON CONFORMING OR NON BINARY STUDENTS. THESE DATA SHOW THAT OUR LGBTQ PLUS BUT OUR LGBTQ PUTS YOUNG PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA YOU DATE PRODUCT THAT ONE AND A HALF TO THREE TIMES THE RATE OF THEIR PEERS. AND IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY TOBACCO USE RATES ARE HIGHER THAN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE WE ARE HOME TO MANY COMMUNITIES WITH LOWER TOBACCO CESSATION RATE. WELL CREEK LOW QUIT RATES AND HIGH USE RATES MEAN THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON TOBACCO USE PREVENTION WE NEED TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR UPCOMING GENERATIONS TO BECOME ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. AFTER ALL THE TOBACCO EXECUTIVES THEMSELVES TOLD US THAT TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE NOTHING MORE THAN NICOTINE DELIVERY. DEVICES WHICH WE HAVE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF PROP SIX AND PROP NINE NINE FUN THAT WE PUT TO REACH TAXES WORK AGAIN THE TO BE. RELATED HEALTH DISPARITIES WE SEE. WITHIN THE LGBT PLUS COMMUNITY AND THE- CAN TO WHAT WE BELONG. ADDITIONAL WE HAVE SEEN THAT INCREASING THE COST OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS ACTS AS AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF. OF PRODUCT USE PREVENTION AND DECREASES DAILY USE AMONG THOSE WHO CURRENTLY USE TOBACCO PRODUCTS. INCREASING TOBACCO PRODUCT COST INCLUDES MINIMUM. I POLICIES THE RETENTION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS COUPONS OR THROUGH RETAIL AXES AS PROPOSED IN SB THREE NINETY FIVE. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE REVENUE TO SUPPORT VITAL PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES TO COMBAT THE TOBACCO EPIDEMIC WHILE THE SAME TIME REDUCING THE NUMBER OF NEW TOBACCO USERS TO ENTER THE MARKET EACH YEAR HE QUALITY CALIFORNIA IS THRILLED TO SUPPORT SB THREE NINE FIVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WE HAVE A ONE SEE IF- WE CAN GO TO OTHER WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY ANYONE IN SUPPORT. IN THE GALLERY SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION DOWN.

THAT WOULD BE GREAT I DON'T MIND EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM AND- ESTIMATES CHAIR- THAT AFTERNOON MR IN MEMBERSHIP I AM HERE BEFORE TODAY SECURE SUPPORT FOR SB TWO FORTY TWO. WHICH WILL HELP CALIFORNIA PLAN FOR FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES- BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK CHRISTINE MONTHLY ON YOUR STAFF FOR ALL HER HARD WORK ON THIS MEASURE ALSO WANT TO KNOW THAT I'M ACCEPTING. ALL OF THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WHICH NOW LIMIT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL TO FUTURE EMERGENCIES WHILE NARROWING REIMBURSEMENT EXCLUSIVELY TO PP. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW MORE THAN FAMILIAR WITH THE MYRIAD IMPACTS OF CODED ON PUBLIC HEALTH ACCESS TO CARE AND FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ONE OF THE MOST TRACKING FEATURES OF THIS RECENT. UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WAS THE IMPACT ON SMALL TO MEDIUM MEDICAL AND DENTAL PRACTICES AS A RESULT OF THE SUDDEN NEED TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY NEW PROTOCOLS AND SECURE PROPRIA. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ALLOW FOR SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CARE WITH THAT AS CONTEXT IN THE IN THE EVENT OF FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES SB TWO FORTY TWO WILL IT WILL REQUIRE INSURERS. TO REIMBURSE PROVIDERS FOR PP FOR THE DURATION OF A FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH STATE OF EMERGENCY OR UNTIL A CONTRACT IS RENEGOTIATED. DURING THE CURRENT PANDEMIC PHYSICIAN PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE STRUGGLE TO STAY OPEN NEARLY HALF OF MEDICAL PRACTICE OWNERS SURVEYED BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. SAID THAT SPENDING ON PP INCREASE 50% OR MORE DURING THE PANDEMIC WILL PEE PEES BECAUSE BECAUSE INCREASED PATIENT VOLUME AND REVENUE DECREASED MANY MEDICAL PRACTICE HAD A CLOSE OFFICES ARE FURLOUGHED EMPLOYEES. A RECENT CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SURVEY OF THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PHYSICIANS SHOW THAT ABOUT HALF OF PRACTICE HEAD EITHER LAY OFF OR FURLOUGH PHYSICIANS AND STAFF AND FULLY PRACTICES AT LEAST TEMPORARILY. A SURVEY BY THE PHYSICIANS FOUNDATION A NATIONAL NONPROFIT ESTIMATED THAT 8% OF ALL PHYSICIAN PRACTICES NATIONALLY AROUND SIXTEEN THOUSAND PRACTICES ACTUALLY CLOSED UNDER THE ECONOMIC STRESS OF THE PANDEMIC THESE CLOSURES AND STAFF REDUCTIONS WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED MEDICAL PRACTICE TOOK PLACE EVEN AS INSURERS ENJOYED STEADY REVENUE AND HISTORIC NET PROFITS IN SOME CASES MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PROFITS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AND MAY TWENTY TWENTY THAT APARTMENT MANAGER. ISSUED AN ALL PLAN LETTER REMINDING HEALTH PLANS ABOUT THEIR ON GOING DUTY. TO ENSURE THEY MAINTAIN ADEQUATE NETWORKS TO PROVIDE ENROLLEES WITH ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES. IN A TIMELY AND GEOGRAPHICALLY APPROPRIATE MANNER THE DEPARTMENT SAID THE LETTER BECAUSE PROVIDERS. INCLUDING MEDICAL AND DENTAL CLINICS AND HOSPITALS REPORTED EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES DUE TO COVER NINETEEN. S. PATIENTS DELAYED RECEIVING ALL BUT EMERGENCY AND URGENT MEDICAL SERVICES. IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED ANOTHER LETTER INDICATED CONCERN ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF HEALTH PLAN NETWORKS. IF PROVIDERS WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO REDUCE TO A LACK OF PP. THE EXPENSE OF ACQUIRING PP OR THE EXPENSE OF CRYING OTHER COVERT NINETEEN RELATED SUPPLIES. PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS HAVE EXPRESSED FEARS THAT. IN THIS AND FUTURE HEALTH A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES INCREASE COSTA PP. COMBINED WITH CONCURRENT DROPS IN PATIENT VISITS COULD RESULT IN A WAVE OF CONSOLIDATION. THAT WOULD INCREASE HEALTHCARE EXPENSES AND DECREASE PATIENT ACCESS TO CARE MOST CONCERNING IS THE POSSIBILITY. THAT IF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LOSE SMALLER PHYSICIAN PRACTICES. IT WILL FURTHER INTENSIFY THE STRESSES ON OUR ALREADY OVERBURDENED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AND MAKE ME IN THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF PATIENTS EVEN HARDER WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING RURAL AND OTHER UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND GROUPS. SB TWO FORTY TWO WILL ENSURE THAT IN FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES THE BURDENS CREATED BY INCREASED UTILIZATION PP. IN MEDICAL SETTINGS WILL BE FAIRLY SHARED BETWEEN HEALTH INSURERS AND THE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED PRACTICES FROM PRACTICE PROVIDING PATIENT CARE- IN WHAT WILL SURELY BE AN EQUALLY CHALLENGING TIME. CONSOLIDATION HEALTHCARE PRACTICE INCREASES HEALTH CARE EXPENSES AND DECREASES PATIENT ACCESS TO CARE. SB TWO FORTY TWO AIMS TO PREVENT SUCH SIX SUCH CONSOLIDATION AND ENSURE THAT IN FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES- THE VIABILITY OF PHYSICIAN PRACTICES ARE NOT THREATENED HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY VIA THE PHONE LINE. IS DOCTOR ARE YOU ON CHIRLA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION SZCZECIN AND DOCTOR HANSEN ERIC HANSON WITH CHOICE. MEDICAL SOCIETY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS AFTERNOON.

BECAUSE THAT WE'RE NOW AVERAGING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY ONE PATIENTS FROM US IN THE FUTURE TWENTY TWENTY I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION'S GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COUNCIL AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBER DOWN TO. DENTISTRY HAS THE- SWIFTLY TO BE ABLE TO TREAT PATIENTS SAFELY DURING THE CURRENT PANDEMIC CONDITION. BUT THIS IS ONLY BEEN POSSIBLE DUE TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND INCREASE AND TREATMENT COSTS. FOUR PP INCLUDING GLOVES FACE MASKS AND NINETY FIVE LEVEL THREE MATH AND COUNSELING NOW REQUIRED TO SAFELY TREAT PATIENTS AND PROTECT MY STAFF AND MYSELF. MAKE PP MANDATORY AND MEDICALLY NECESSARY. THE COST OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT HAS GONE UP EXPONENTIALLY THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. AMPLE A BOX OF GLOVES USED TO THAT WE USE ON A DAILY BASIS USED TO COST TWELVE DOLLARS ABOUT. IT WENT FROM TWELVE DOLLARS TO SIXTY DOLLARS A BOX DUE TO INCREASED COSTS DESTRUCTIONS AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND INCREASED LEVELS OF REQUIRED PP AND WELCOME COSTS HAVE GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY THEY'RE STILL TWICE THE PRICE. TWO TO THREE TIMES THE PRICE THAT WE PAID REDLANDS THE LARGEST DENTAL PLAN PAPER PP FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS AND TWENTY TWENTY BUT ALL AT THE END IT AS OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST AND IT BURIED IN THE AMOUNT THAT WERE BEING PAID. AND IT DID NOT COVER THE P. P. EXPENSIVE HOWEVER THE CURRENT PANDEMIC AND INCREASED COSTS REMAIN A HUGE CONCERN FOR PRACTICES AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY EXTENSION SECOND YEAR WITH NEW VARIANTS NUMBER CHECK. SOMEWHERE TO THE EMERGENCE OF HIV AND AIDS AND EIGHTY CLUB HAS REQUIRED A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF THE AMOUNT OF P. P. USING THEM OFFICES TO PROTECT PATIENT AND DENTAL PROFESSIONAL. WELL WE BLINDSIDED BY. SHOULD BE PER FOR THE NEXT. BY ENSURE PROVIDER ARE STILL. TO PORTAGE BUT IT'S NOT THE TO INCREASE THEIR PEOPLE. USAGE EMPLOYEE NEEDS PRO TO PROTECT PUBLIC.

UTILIZED NATION OF PP SENT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC AND EARLY ON- YOU KNOW I HAD SUPPLIES AVAILABLE FOR SURGICAL PROCEDURES THAT WE MAY HAVE AREN'T BILL PATIENT THAT COMES IN- BUT NOW EVERY PATIENT HAS TO BE TREATED AS IF WE'RE DOING A SEARCH COPAYS FOR THEIR ACUTE THEY'LL- IN ORDER TO PROTECT MY STAFF- TO PROTECT OTHER PATIENTS. AND THE LIGHT CAN SO IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC I ORDERED A LARGE SUPPLIES OF DEFEAT THAT NEVER ARRIVED AND MANY OF IT CAME FROM CHINA BUT NEVER NEVER CAME BUT ORDERS WERE CANCELED. THE PRICES THEN WE END UP IN THAT FIRST THREE MONTH TO THREE TIMES WHAT WE WOULD NORMALLY PAY OUT FROM OUR NOR NOR ARE NORMAL MEDICAL SUPPLY- PROVIDERS SO IMMEDIATELY THIS WAS OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE ISSUE FOR US INDEPENDENT POSITION THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SMALLER- MARGIN TO OPERATE WITHIN SO WHEN WE'RE SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO BUY PP TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SUPPLIES FOR OUR STAFF IT WAS A HUGE FINANCIAL BURDEN OUT. MY DENTISTRY COLLEAGUE ALSO POINTED OUT ABOUT THE CHANGE IN YOU KNOW- PATIENT ACCESS THAT WE'VE HAD TO SUFFER AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC THAT- HAS BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE AND EVEN UNLIKE THE DENTIST THOUGH IN PRIMARY CARE I HAVE. YOU KNOW HOW TO SEE SICK PEOPLE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST SAY IF YOU HAD ANYTHING FOR TWO WEEKS WE WON'T SEE IRAQ I'M SAYING WELL THE NINETEENTH PICK THE THAT AND SO WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES WITH EVERY VISIT SO THIS.

CONTAINED IN THE MEASURE I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT ALL OF THE SUGGESTED CHANGES AS DESCRIBED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS WE ALL HAVE WITNESSED A VIVIDLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC STAFFING IS PERHAPS THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF A HOSPITAL'S OPERATION STAFFING DETERMINES WHETHER AN EMERGENCY CAN KEEP ACCEPTING AN EMERGENCY ROOM CAN KEEP ACCEPTING PATIENTS HOW MANY SURGERIES CAN BE PERFORMED AT ONCE AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY THE QUALITY OF THE CARE THAT PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE WITH YOUR MEMBERS TAKEN TODAY SB SIX THIRTY SEVEN DOES TWO THINGS. FIRST IT REQUIRES HOSPITALS TO REPORT NURSE STAFFING DATA AND STUFF COVERT TESTING DATA TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ON A WEEKLY BASIS DURING A STATEWIDE HEALTH RELATED EMERGENCY AND ON A MONTHLY BASIS AT ALL OTHER TIMES AND SECOND IT DIRECTS HOSPITALS TO PROBABLY POST NOTICES OF EMERGENCY HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS INCLUDING NURSE TO PATIENT RATIO WAIVERS DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THEIR LICENSE IN ON THEIR FACILITY WEBSITE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE BILL THE COVERT SPECIFIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WILL SUNSET EITHER IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE OR THE END OF THE DECLARED EMERGENCY WHICHEVER. COMES FIRST UNFORTUNATELY AS THE RECENT NEWS ABOUT PLATEAUING VACCINATIONS IN THE RISE OF NEW DELTA VARIANT SO ALARMINGLY ATTEST WE ARE NOT YET ANYWHERE NEAR BEING CLEAR OF THE CURRENT CRISIS NURSES AND OTHER FRONTLINE HOSPITAL STAFF REMAIN AT HIGH RISK OF EXPOSURE AND WILL REMAIN SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE SO WHAT IT IS AS IMPORTANT AS EVER FOR HOSPITALS TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF COVERT CASES AMONG THEIR STAFFS HAVING SAID THAT WE CAN BE THANKFUL THAT HAAS AS ARE NO LONGER EXT. THE ON PRESS. SO THAT WE SAW EARLIER IN THE PANDEMIC. AS A CONSEQUENCE THE EXPEDITED WAIVERS OF NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS THAT WERE GRANTED HOSPITALS AT THAT TIME. HAVE SINCE ENDED BUT STAFFING ISSUES NEVERTHELESS REMAIN A SERIOUS CONCERN THE DATA REPORTING THIS BILL. WILL ENSURE NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS REMAIN MANAGEABLE FOR THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF PATIENTS. NURSES AND OTHER CRITICAL STAFF. AND THE POSTING OF WAIVERS WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT HEALTHCARE WORKERS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY MEMBERS AT LARGE. WILL HAVE READY ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT THE HOSPITALS IN WHICH THEY ARE WORKING. OR ARE SEEKING CARE WITH ME VIRTUALLY TODAY TO TESTIFY ANSWER QUESTIONS. MISS TAYLOR JACKSON LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION THE BILL'S SPONSOR- AND ALSO- MITCH STEIGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS AFTERNOON. THANK THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER NEWMAN- MEDITECH MADAM- MEMORY PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THE LETTER OPENER PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI YEAH MISTER KAREN MEMBERS- TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION PROUD BUNKERS OF SB SIX THREE SEVEN I'D LIKE TO ALSO THANK THE CHAIR TO MAKE SOUTH FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US ON THIS BILL DURING THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION AS SENATOR NEWMAN SAID HE AND HE WAS VERY CONCERNED WHEN HOSPITALS CREATED ARTIFICIAL NURSE SHORTAGES IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GOVERNOR'S TEMPORARY WAIVERS. OF CALIFORNIANS NURSE TO PATIENT RATIO TAPPING ON THE DEFINITION OF A FORM HOSPITALS WERE ALLOWED TO ASSIGN NURSES AND ALL UNITS INCLUDING THE ICY YOU MORE PATIENTS AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN TO BE SAFE. AS A RESULT HOSPITAL'S PROFITED WHILE NURSES WATCH THEIR PATIENTS SUFFER AND THEIR COLLEAGUES DIE BECAUSE OF DECISIONS THAT LEFT NURSES UNDERSTAFFED OVERBURDENED AND UNABLE TO GIVE THEIR PATIENTS THE ADEQUATE TIME AND CARE THEY DESPERATELY NEEDED. HOWEVER EVEN BEFORE THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION HOSPITALS WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY APPROVAL BY CDPH TO GET AROUND COMPLYING WITH A STAFFING MINIMUM MOVING FORWARD IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE REPORTING RULES UNDER AT THE SIXTY SEVEN IN PLACE TO SAFEGUARD PATIENT CARE THROUGH THE PROVISION OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AN ACCURATE. INFORMATION WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT THE FRONT LINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ANY HOSPITAL NURSES RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. THOUGH ON THIS NARROW REPORTING AND TRANSPARENCY BILL I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOUNG THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GET UP CARE WOULD AND MEMBERS THIS IS JENNIFER MARRIED WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION FILLING IN FOR THE LAST YEAR. AND THE SPEAKER. WE SUPPORT IT SB SIX THIRTY SEVEN WHICH WILL PROTECT HEALTHCARE WORKERS BY ESTABLISHING CRITICAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THREE Q. CARE HOSPITALS DURING STATES OF EMERGENCY. IN RESPONSE UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND FOR EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA HAS PERMITTED HOSPITAL TO APPLY FOR WAIVERS TO CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING STATUTORY NURSE TO PATIENT STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. THE ISSUANCE OF WAIVER IT HAS RESULTED IN INCREASES THE WORKLOAD ALREADY OVERBURDENED NURSES. CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT AND WORKPLACE SAFETY HEALTHCARE WORKERS AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE ACCESS. TO ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION ON STAFFING LEVELS IN THE HOSPITALS AND WE SHARE WORKING OR SEEKING CARE. EVEN PRE PANDEMIC AND CREE WAIVERS SOME HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN FLAGRANTLY OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LIMITS SET BY STATE LAW. LAST MONTH SENATOR CORTESE AN ASSEMBLYMEMBERS CAMERA AND WE- AUTHORED A JOINT LETTER CALLING ON GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL IN THE BAY AREA INSISTING THAT THE HOSPITAL JEFF THE PERSISTENT STAFFING ISSUES THAT WERE FLICKING THE HOSPITAL PRE PANDEMIC. ACTORS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ROAD UP ITS MERIT AND FOR BEING OUT OF COMPLIANCE. WITH MANDATORY NURSE TO PATIENT STAFFING RATIOS FIVE SEPARATE TIMES. BETWEEN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. NURSING STAFFING RATIOS WERE SET BY STATE LAW BECAUSE OF THE RECOGNITION THAT WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE STAFFING LEVELS IT CAUSES A REAL DANGER TO PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE WORKERS. THE DATA THAT HOSPITAL PROVIDES THE CDPH UNDER SB SIX THIRTY SEVEN WILL ENSURE THE NURSES HAVE THE RESOURCES. AND APPROPRIATE STAFFING TO CARE FOR THEIR PATIENTS AND STATE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WILL HELP SAFEGUARD THE PROGRESS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE. TOWARD IMPROVING HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENTS. CALIFORNIA'S NURSE TO PATIENT RATIO LOTS HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO RESELL AND BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES. IN STATES WITHOUT FACE BACKING OF FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON SB SIX THIRTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES- IN OPPOSITION- PLEASE GO AHEAD PART. GLAZER AND KIANI BURCHELL. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL SB NATION. ABOUT THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HOSPITAL PARTNERED WITH LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. TO CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH COPD AT NINETEEN INCLUDING RECORDING KEY DATA INFORMATION AIMED AT COORDINATING AND IMPROVING OUR COLLECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. SB SIX THREE SEVEN POSTED NEW DATA REQUIREMENTS ON HOSPITALS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN COLLECTED WERE NEEDED DURING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THESE ARE OF ANY PLAYOFF FOR LOW OR REPEATED CANCELED SHIPPED. WITH THE AMENDMENT BEING TAKEN TO SAYING COMMITTEE ON F. B. SIX THREE SEVEN HOSPITALS WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECORD EVEN MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO CANCEL CHIP. UNIT INFORMATION. AND REASONS FOR THE CANCELLATION. STAFFING A DIE CARE WHICH MAKES TRACK REPEAT CAN SHE IMMENSELY CHAO TASK WE QUESTION WHAT VALUE IF ANY THIS INFORMATION PROVIDES IN OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION HAD PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO SB SIX THREE SEVEN TO LIMIT THIS NEW REPORTING TO OCCUR ONLY DURING STATEWIDE HEALTH RELATED EMERGENCY. HOWEVER THE BILL CONTINUES TO REQUIRE REPORTING OF THE STAFFING DECISIONS EVEN WHEN THERE IS NOT AN EMERGENCY SO WE REGRET GRADUALLY MUST REMAIN OPPOSED. GIVEN LIMITED UTILITY TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE PUBLIC AND INFORMATION ON SHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELED C. H. A. HAS SUGGESTED FOCUSING THE NEW DATA COLLECTION OF LAYOFFS AND FURLOUGHS. WHICH MAY BE MORE RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORKFORCE CAPACITY OF A HOSPITAL CAN SHIP CAN CHANGE DAILY. THE VALUE OF ANY OF THIS INFORMATION IS QUESTIONABLE AT THE BILL ANALYSIS POINTS OUT ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE DATA REQUIRED BY THIS BILL WOULD NOT LIKELY A FIFTY P. H. IN DETERMINING. THE PREFILTER PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE BEING MET. C. H. A. HAD REQUESTED THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO SUNSET ALL OF THE BILL'S REPORTING PROVISIONS ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. CURRENTLY SOME PROVISIONS SUNSET ON THAT DATE AN TIME ARE PERMANENT CHANGES TO STATE LAW. ONE CONSISTENT CONCEPT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REASSESS THE SCOPE THAT NINETEEN RELATED LEGISLATION ALL AT ONCE. THAT REVIEW WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THREE YEARS FROM TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHEN WE WILL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE GATHER. FOR THESE REASONS C. H. A. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE TODAY ON SB SIX THREE SEVEN. AND MISTER CHAIRMAN KEY ONLY BURCHILL IS ON THE LINE SHE'S ON THE LINE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU- ANY WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY. SEEING NONE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINESFOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION JUST YOUR NAME POSITION ON THE BILL AN ORGANIZATION IF YOU REPRESENT ONE SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY PLEASE GO AHEAD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION FOR SB SIX THREE SEVEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WELL THAT WAS MY NUMBER TWO THIRTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS KELLY MCMILLAN I'M CALLING BEHALF OF MEMORIAL CARE WE ARE HAD TAKEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB SIX THIRTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT CALLER PLEASE.

AND WITH NO RESPONSE WILL HOLD THE LINE THERE'S NO ONE ELSE ON SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION- VERY WELL THANK YOU BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DR AT. WESTERN IS AREA. OKAY DOCTORS DOCTORS AREA TODAY HAS A. THANK YOU DR WOULD YOU FOR THAT'S ABOUT THE PROMOTION- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD SENATOR AYE- I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK ANY TIME WE COLLECT DATA IT HELPS US IMPROVE OUR OUTCOMES- AND I THINK IN MANY OCCASIONS- WHEN YOU COLLECT DATA IT CREATES QUITE A BIT OF PAPER WORK AND- SEEMS TO BE ONLY FITTING. THAT WE CONTINUE COLLECTING THAT INFORMATION. SO MY QUICK QUESTION FOR THIS IS. WE JUST WENT THROUGH A PANDEMIC A YEARLONG PANDEMIC STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WE'RE STILL HAVING SEARCHES IN CERTAIN PLACES. THE DATA COLLECTED IN THIS TIME PERIOD OF ABOUT THE LAST YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS. WOULDN'T THAT IN ITSELF. HELP US PROVIDE US THE GUIDANCE THAT WE NEED RATHER THAN ANOTHER BILL THAT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ALLOWS US TO COLLECT DATA. AND SHOULD THE QUESTION DOCTOR MISSOURIAN- I THINK HE CORRECTED THE CORRECT AND THOUGHT CORRECTED IT BUT I THINK IF- I LET ME SEE LET ME DO YOU KNOW THIS IS ALWAYS A DYNAMIC SITUATION YOUR POINT THE PANDEMIC'S NOT YET. OVER LET ME LET MS JACKSON FROM SEEN A REPLY TO THAT PLEASE. PLEASE GO AHEAD MR JACKSON. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND THINK YOU A FAMILY MEMBER THAT THEY ARE AND FOR THAT QUESTION- YEAH SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF F. B. SIX THREE SEVEN WORK BEING- ACT TO AND RECEIVED BY AT THE DPA- BUT THERE HAVE BEENISSUES NUMBER ONE WITHOUT INFORMATION BEING POSTED PUBLICLY INSURED REGULARLY SO THAT YOU KNOW YOUR OFFICE ANY OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS LAW. CAN GET ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION AS WELL AS GOING FORWARD STAFFING IS STADIUM BACKSTOPPING CHANGES REGULARLY SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO NEED TO RECEIVE THIS DATA I'M PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE CANCELLATION OF CHEFS- ALL THOSE PIECES- THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE BILL- BECAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE ARE CHANGING AND ONGOING AND IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND- AND THAT IS NOT GOOD ANECDOTAL INFORMATION AND IT WILL REALLY HELP THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL. ONE IMPORTANT THING- NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS ANTHONY STAFFING THAT THEY HAVE THE WHOLE DATA SET THEY CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AT RATHER THAN YOU KNOW OKAY THIS PIECEMEAL WHATEVER INFORMATION THEY MAY BE GETTING FROM OTHER PLACES OKAY LET ME LET ME THINK MOMENT THAT. MISS JACKSON LET ME INTERRUPT YOU FOR A MINUTE LET ME THAT I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS IT WARRANTS MERIT AND I THINK. IT IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO COLLECT DATA. BUT I ALSO DO TO MAKE A POINT THAT. WE DO WENT THROUGH A- SOCIAL IT WAS AN EXPERIMENT IT WAS REALITY. AND WE JUST. WEWERE IN A POSITION WHERE WE COLLECTED REAL TIME DATA. BASED ON THAT COULD YOU TELL US WHAT THEY NEED FOR THIS BILL WOULD BE BECAUSE FROM THIS POINT FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE COLLECTING DATA THAT'S WONDERFUL. AND WE NEED THAT BUT WHEN WE JUST WENT THROUGH A REAL TIME CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE HAD A YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS TO COLLECT DATA WHAT IS DATA DATA SUGGESTING TO US. I'D SAY FOR THE IN A WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THAT IS THAT THERE ARE SOME HOSPITALS THAT WERE NOT- IN A SITUATION OF A STAFFING SHORTAGE. BUT WERE ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT THE CDPH FROM THE ADMINISTRATION BUT THERE WAS A STAFFING SHORTAGE OF SOME KIND AND WE FOUND THAT OUT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW HOSPITALS RETURNING TO THE FACILITY. AND TURNING I'M SORRY TO THE STATE AND SAYINGYOU KNOW HEY WE DON'T HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH THEM ONE IT'S COMING BACK FROM THE GROUND IN THE ACTUAL REPORTING IS THERE'S MAFFIA POLICE HAVE STAFF NURSES THAT NORMALLY WORKS. THREE FOUR FIVE IF THE WEEK ARE ALL OF A SUDDEN ONLY WORKING ONE SHIFT A WEEK SO THAT PROBABILITY ACTUALLY. IN A STAFFING CRISIS WHERE THEY NEED TO BE GIVEN THE FREEDOM TO NOT FALL OWNER SUFFICIENT REFILLS WHICH OFTEN PUTS THE PATIENT IN DANGER OR IS THAT FACILITY MANUFACTURING IT. SO THAT HAS SPENT SOME REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION WITH YOU THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC- IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. IT'S A BIT MORE SPECULATION THAN IT WAS BASED ON DATA SO I WOULD HAVE HOPE THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE NUMBERS PROVIDED- BUT BUT THAT'S FINE BECAUSE- I DO ALSO SEE THE MERIT AND COLLECTING THIS INFORMATION MOVING FORWARD SO I DO. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND I- I DO HOPE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO. BET GETTER ANSWERS FROM HOSPITALS- BECAUSE THEIR SERVICES ARE CRITICALLY ON THE LINE AS WELL IF THEY CAN'T PRODUCE NUMBERS TO TELL US WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED WHAT THE PICTURE WAS. OF I DON'T KNOW C. H. A. WOULD WANT TO COMMENT ON THIS BUT I'D BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW. OF WHAT SOME OF THE OUTCOMES OF THE DATA WAS THAT THEY COLLECTED DURING THIS PERIOD WITH THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. VERY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I'M SEEING NONE SENATOR NEWMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THE BILL DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND- A DO PASS AS AMENDED APPROPRIATIONS.

NAZARIAN I REQUEST RIVAS AYE RODRIGUEZ VEGAS ICE SANTIAGO WALDRON WALDRON I. EIGHT ZERO ZERO THE CONSENT COUNTERS OUT THANK YOU- THIS POINT WHERE YOU READY MIX PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF SENATOR SCOTT WIENER I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING ALL OF THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT INCORPORATE THE FOLLOWING SAFEGUARDS INTO THIS BILL. ELIMINATE SOCIAL SHARING FROM THE BILL INTRODUCED POSITION LIMITS AND LASTLY REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO DEVELOP HARM REDUCTION EDUCATION AROUND THE USE AROUND USED FOR THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY YOUTH AS WELL AS DEVELOP FIRST RESPONDER TRAINING. SENATOR WIENER WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND HS GRATITUDE TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR COLLABORATION ON THE BILL AND CRAFTING AMENDMENTS THAT IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY. AND EDUCATION AND REDUCE USE RELATED HARMS SENATE BILL FIVE NINETEEN DECRIMINALIZE THE POSSESSION AND PERSONAL USE. OF PSILOCYBIN PSILOCIN MDMA LSD DMT AND MESCALINE AND I WILL GAME FOR PEOPLE TWENTY ONE YEARS AND OLDER. THIS IS NOT A FULL LEGALIZATION BILL. IT DOESN'T LEGALIZE THE SALE OF PSYCHEDELICS. IT DOESN'T LEGALIZE THE SALE DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OR SHARING OR GIVING OF PSYCHEDELICS TO ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. ALL OF THAT WILL STILL REMAIN ILLEGAL. INSTEAD SB FIVE NINETEEN NARROWLY REMOVE SOME MISDEMEANOR PENALTIES FOR POSSESSION FOR POSSESSING PSYCHEDELICS FOR PERSONAL USE. ARE RACIST AND FAILED WAR ON DRUGS ON A MORE ON DRUG POLICY APPROACH HAS DONE NOTHING TO MAKE US SAFER. BUT IT'S LED TO MASSIVE PUBLIC EXPENDITURES TORN COMMUNITIES DEEPLY IMPACTED BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES AND DID NOTHING TO MAKE DRUG USE SAFER OR REDUCE OVERDOSES. INDEED THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. THE WAR ON DRUGS MAKES OUR COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE AND MAKE STRESS DRUG USE LESS SAFE IT'S TIME WE STOP THIS FAILED MASS INCARCERATION STRATEGY IN A KNOWLEDGE THAT NOT ALL SUBSTANCES ARE HARMFUL OR DANGEROUS IN FACT QUITE THE OPPOSITE HAS BEEN FOUND. OF PSYCHEDELICS. THE PSYCHEDELIC SUBSTANCES SUBSTANCES INCLUDING THIS BILL HAVE BEEN FOUND TO ASSIST WITH THE MERIT OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING ANXIETY ADDICTION DEPRESSION INSOMNIA. EATING DISORDERS. AND CRUCIALLY POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. VETERANS AND THOSE WITH SIMILARLY UNRESOLVED TRAUMAS HAVE REPORTED A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN SUICIDAL IDEATION AND PTSD RELATED SYMPTOMS AFTER EXPERIENCING A PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE OR PARTICIPATING IN PSYCHEDELIC ASSISTED THERAPY. A RESULT THAT MANY WERE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE HER TYPICAL TREATMENTS. PEOPLE ADDICTED TO HEROIN AND OTHER SUBSTANCES HAVE LITERALLY BEEN ABLE TO END THEIR DICTION THROUGH PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY. THESE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN FOUND BOTH IN A CLINICAL SETTING AND ANECDOTALLY IN MORE COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS IT'S TIME WE RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THESE SUBSTANCES. EVEN OUTSIDE OF A CLINICAL SETTING. FURTHERMORE THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICAL ADDICTION SIMPLY AREN'T PRESENT WITH CLOSE WITH CLASSIC COLUSA GINS BECAUSE THESE SUBSTANCES LIKE LSD. AND PSILOCYBIN ARE SIMPLY NOT ADDICTIVE. IN FACT THE SUBSTANCES ARE OFTEN USED AS AN ADJECTIVE SUPPRESSANT PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. WELL UTILIZED DOSES OF PSYCHEDELIC TO HELP EASE THE WITHDRAWAL OR DECREASE THEIR DESIRES FOR DRUGS ALTOGETHER. FOR EXAMPLE EXAMPLE PSILOCYBIN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE SUBSTANCE EVER MINISTERS TO THOSE LOOKING TO QUIT SMOKING TOBACCO. I WILL GAIN HAS HELPED MANY TREAT THEIR HER ONE ADDICTION. LAST NOVEMBER OREGON VOTERS PASSED TWO BALLOT MEASURES ONE THAT DECRIMINALIZE THE PERSONAL USE OF ALL SUBSTANCES. AND ANOTHER TO AUTHORIZED THE CREATION OF A PSILOCYBIN ASSISTED THERAPY PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS PORTUGAL HAVE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY DECRIMINALIZED THE POSSESSION AND PERSONAL USE OF ALL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. WHILE OPPONENTS TO DECRIMINALIZE. ARGUE PORTUGAL'S APPROACH WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH. DRUG OVERDOSES HIV RATES HAVE PLUMMETED SINCE THE POLICY WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE HAS INCREASED AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE OR THE GENERAL POPULATION. IT MAY SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE AT FIRST. AND IT MIGHT SEEM FRIGHTENING TO LIFT CRIMINAL PENALTIES ON POSSESSION FOR PERSONAL USE BUT IT'S TIME CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZES WHERE WE HAVE FAILED. WE KNOW CRIMINALIZATION DOESN'T WORK TO PREVENT DRUG USE. IT DOESN'T PREVENT DRUG USE MISUSE OR OVERDOSE ALL IT DOES IS PUSH DRUGS INTO THE SHADOWS AND MAKE THEM LESS SAFE. IT MAKES SOCIETY LESS SAFE. SB FIVE NINETEEN ENTERS THAT PEOPLE CAN KEEP USING THE SUBSTANCES THAT ARE PROVIDED THAT THE PROVIDE RELIEF TO THOSE SUFFERING FROM DEBILITATING MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION DISORDERS WITHOUT FEAR OF ARREST. TO PROMOTE SAFER USE THIS BILL ENSURES PEOPLE CAN LEGALLY TESTS THESE SUBSTANCES TO REDUCE RISK OF CROSS CONTAMINATION. WITH COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND EDUCATION FOR YOUTH WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED INTO BETTER EDUCATION. TO EDUCATE CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT SAFE FOR USE. AS WELL AS FIRST RESPONDER TRAINING AS RECORD AS A RECOMMENDED MODELS WE CAN ADOPT TO PROVIDE FOR LEGAL ACCESS TO THESE SUBSTANCES IN A SAFER AND CONTROLLED MANNER. SB FIVE NINETEEN PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN CHANGING COURSE AND MOVING AWAY FROM OUR MISCONCEPTIONS AND FEARS SURROUNDING THE SUBSTANCES AND FROM OUR SOCIETAL OBSESSION WITH DICTATING HOW OFTEN OR HOW OTHERS OTHERS UTILIZE THEM FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH AND WELL BEING. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS JUST GOLD PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER OF THE HER ROLL CARTS PROJECT AND A CO SPONSOR OF SB FIVE NINETEEN AND A SMELL ALI ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE COUNCIL POLICY ADVOCACY AT THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY ASSOCIATION. FOR PSYCHEDELIC STUDIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS WICKS- WILL GO TO EXPECT WILL GO TO OUR- WITNESS ON THE PHONE FIRST WHICH IS GOING TO BE JUST COOL- SO OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR JESKELL. JUST WANTED TO OPEN. MY NAME IS JESSE GOLD AND I'M THE FOUNDER OF HER OWN PARTY PROJECT WHICH IS THE FINAL ONE C. THREE NONPROFIT AND THE CO SPONSOR CALIFORNIA BILL SB FIVE ONE NINE I COULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED BEING IN THIS POSITION TODAY ADVOCATING PERCENT OF MEDICINE BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT MY HEART IN TUITION AND HAS CONSISTENTLY LED TO ME FEELING ALL EXCEPT- AND LYFT SERVICE BEFORE THE MILITARY I WORKED AS AN INVESTMENT BANKER ON WALL STREET. I DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY TO GIVE BACK AND SERVE THIS GREAT COUNTRY BUT I DON'T COMMUNITY AND PURPOSE AS AN AIRBORNE RANGER NOT DEVELOPED AS A LEADER AS A NON COMMISSIONED OFFICER I MADE A PLEDGE TO LEAVE NO SOLDIER BEHIND I FIRST FOUND PSYCHEDELIC MEDICINE OUT OF NECESSITY HAVING TRIED ALL THAT WAS OFFERED TO ME BY THE MILITARY MEDICINE. I WAS BARELY HOLDING ON. I TURNED TO SAY. OF THE LACK EFFORT TO SURVIVE. UNFORTUNATELY IT WORKED AMAZINGLY WELL. PRO CARDS PROJECT WAS CREATED TO EDUCATE AND CONNECT MY FELLOW VETERANS TO BE. ACTIVE OPTIONS. THIS WAS NEARLY FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AGO AND SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE VETERAN SUICIDE EPIDEMIC. NEARLY EVERY DAY MY TEAM RECEIVING MESSAGES FROM VETERANS WHO HAVE FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE SYSTEM. MORE FROM THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE EXHAUSTED AND DESPERATE AT THE LACK OF OPTIONS. IT'S HARD TO PUT INTO WORDS HOW MUCH THIS CRISIS HAS DECIMATED THE MILITARY COMMUNITY. MY COMMUNITY. THE WAY OF ALL. OF IT ALL HAS FALLEN ON INDIVIDUALS AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS. MANY OF WHICH ARE AT A BREAKING POINT. JUST LAST MONTH ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE. A VETERAN TOOK HIS OWN LIFE. HE WAS DOING HIS BEST TO SAVE OTHERS SIMILAR TO A LOT OF US. BUT IT CAME. AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH. VETERANS SHOULD NOT TO FACE THIS ALONE IN THE SHADOWS. THANK YOU DON'T HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE SAID BETTER LIVES AND MAKE NO MISTAKE VETERANS ALL OR PURSUING THESE OPTIONS EN MASSE RIGHT NOW WHETHER GOING TO OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE MEXICO OR PERU OR DOING IT UNDER FEAR OF CRIMINALITY OUTLASTED DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES AS WELL. THIS IS HAPPENING CURRENTLY JUST RECENTLY THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH REYES SECOND OUT CENTRAL IS A THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT A SENTIMENT THAT HAS BEEN ECHOED BY THE FDA AS WELL AS JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY AND MANY OTHER PRESTIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS. OF VETERANS ARE DYING TODAY VETERANS ARE DYING RIGHT NOW SB FIVE ONE NINE THE COMPASSIONATE SUPPORT AND PROVIDES MEASURED HOPE IN A TIME FRAME OF MONTHS NOT YEARS. TO THOSE THAT ARE BARELY HOLDING ON RIGHT NOW. I WOULD LIKE DATE. EVERYONE HERE FOR YOUR TIME- FOR YOUR FIGHT GO ON S. FIVE ONE NINE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE MOVED HER WITNESS- IN PERSON THE GALLERY PLEASE GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. I MISS MY LOAD EITHER A LEE POLICY DIRECTOR AND COUNSEL FOR THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY ASSOCIATION FOR PSYCHEDELIC STUDIES OR MAPS RESEARCH AN EDUCATIONAL NONPROFIT FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WITH THE MISSION OF CREATING MEDICAL LEGAL AND CULTURAL CONTACTS FOR BENEFIT FOR PEOPLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE CAREFUL USES OF PSYCHEDELICS. I WAS BORN TO IMMIGRANT PARENTS AND FRESNO AND ALTHOUGH THEY WORK HARD TO GIVE ME THE LIFE THAT I HAVE I MYSELF HAVE SUFFERED FROM DEPRESSION ANXIETY. I HAVE ALSO USED PRESENTLY ILLICIT SUBSTANCES FOR THERAPEUTIC SPIRITUAL AND CELEBRATORY PURPOSES FOR MOST OF MY LIFE AT TIMES WITH THREE GENERATIONS OF MY FAMILY. I'VE ALSO WITNESSED FRIENDS HAVE CHALLENGING AND SOMETIMES TRAGIC EXPERIENCES WITH DRUGS. FROM ADDICTION TO OVERDOSE TO PSYCHOSIS THE SUICIDE. CRIMINALISATION DID NOT SOLVE THOSE RISKS AND OFTEN EXACERBATED THEM. IN SHORT PROHIBITION IS A PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTER EVIDENCE COLLECTED OVER THE LAST FIVE DECADES POINTS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT CRIMINAL PENALTIES DO NOT DETER SUBSTANCE USE OR HELP PEOPLE EXPERIENCING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND INSTEAD INCREASE TRAUMA AND DESPERATION. DECRIMINALIZATION WILL EMPOWER PEOPLE TO SEEK HONEST EDUCATION THE STIGMATIZE THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR AND THAT OF THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM AND FACILITATE WERE NEEDED THE ABILITY TO SEEK SUPPORT. FOR DETRIMENTAL EXPERIENCE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SUBSTANCES. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE NOW HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TURN DRUG POLICY AWAY FROM PUNITIVE FRAMEWORKS AND INSTEAD TOWARD HARM REDUCTION CONCEPTS THAT MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. BANK KNOWLEDGE IN GROUP OR FACILITATED USE AND BY SPECIFICALLY MAKING SPACE FOR INTENTIONAL USE THAT IS MADE SAFER BY THE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE OF OTHERS. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES HOW PSYCHEDELICS HAVE BEEN USING TRADITIONS THROUGHOUT HISTORY AS WELL AS SOME OF THE MODERN WAYS PEOPLE USE PSYCHEDELICS TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES. I AM ENCOURAGED BY THE AMENDMENT TO ALLOW THE COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY THIS BILL TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES. FOR CRITICAL SERVICES WHICH WOULD PREVENT AND REDUCE DRUG HARMS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE LIKE HONEST EDUCATION ACCESSIBLE HARM REDUCTION MEASURES AND AN ARMS CRISIS RESPONSE. THESE GUARDRAILS ARE CRITICAL TO RESPONSIBLY TRANSITION AWAY FROM THE DRUG WAR IN FACT MATHIS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER. FOR PSILOCYBIN WAS DECRIMINALIZED IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TRAIN ITS FIRST RESPONDERS ARE CHALLENGING PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISES ARE NOT EXASPERATED BY DISPROPORTIONATE OR INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSES. MODERN RESEARCH INCLUDING RESEARCH THAT MAPS A SPONSORED AND CONDUCTED OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IS EXPECTED TO SOON CONFIRMED THE THERAPEUTIC PROMISE OF THESE SUBSTANCES. AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THEY'RE ALREADY BEING USED FOR HEALING AT GREAT LEGAL RISK BY GROUPS AND NDIVIDUALS WHO DESERVE SAFETY WHEN THEY SEEK ALTERNATIVES. TO CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TREATMENTS. PEOPLE FROM THE GLOBAL DIASPORA ARE WORTHY OF KNOWING THEY WILL BE CRIMINALIZED FOR SEEKING ACCESS pTO THEIR OWN ANCESTRAL PRACTICES. AND EVERYONE DESERVES A POLICY APPROACH FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT VALUES THEIR SAFETY AND WELL BEING OVER PUNISHMENT. IT'S TIME TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR PROVIDE ANY CLARIFICATION WHATSOEVER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE DO HAVE A REGISTER WITNESS IN OPPOSITION JOSEPH ADAMS WHO'S HERE IN PERSON. PLEASE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI SO MY NAME IS JOSEPH WELCOME ADAMS AND I WAS HERE. TO SPEAK FOR THE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. BUT HERE I CAME IN HEREAND SOME AMENDMENTS WERE ANNOUNCED- I WAS GOING TO COME HERE AND- I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE SOCIAL SHARING ASPECT OF THIS BILL- I DIDN'T TO HAVING IT LEGALIZED. SOCIAL SHARING WITHOUT ANY REGULATIONS BEYOND THE- PROHIBITION AGAINST KNOWINGLY SHARING WITH MINORS WOULD HAVE BEEN. VERY DANGEROUS- BUT IT'S SOUNDING LIKE. THEY'RE TAKING OUT THE SOCIAL SHARING AND SO. NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO ONCE THE AMENDMENTS ARE FULLY RELEASED I'M GONNA TO REALLY COME THROUGH THEM BUT- RIGHT NOW IT'S LOOKING LIKE I'M ACTUALLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL NOW.

PSYCHEDELIC GUIDANCE BUSINESSES WHERE PEOPLE GIVE THE DRUGS FOR FREE BUT THEN YOU CHARGE FOR YOUR SERVICES WE'RE NOT DOING THAT ANYMORE. WE'RE ACTUALLY JUST. YOU KNOW.

VERY WELL THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING AND- JUST SO THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. SO THE- SOCIAL SARING HAS HAS HAS REALLY NOT BEEN REMOVED WE HAVE READ- RENAMED IT TO BE. THE CIVITATE OR SUPPORTED USE. AND WE FURTHER DEFINE WHAT THAT MEANS AND SO I JUST WANTED MAKES CHURCH MISTER JOSEPH OPOKU MADAMS UNDERSTANDS THAT- I HAD SIGNIFICANT. CONCERNS ABOUT THE PHRASE THAT THE TERMINOLOGY THERE AND- AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO AS YOU AS YOU ARE YOUR POSITION MAY CHANGE NOW THAT YOU READ AS YOUREAD THE AMENDMENTS BUT I WANTED HER TO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TO YOU AND OTHERS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WITH THAT WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY GREAT MISTER MASON. WELL I GUESS THIS IS A QUESTION FOR SOME MEMBER WICKS AT THIS IS THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THE TIMES THAT I DON'T LOVE- THE THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN- INSTEAD OF BEING IN OUR COMMITTEE ROOMS WITH HAVING EXPERTS HAVING THREE EXPERTS ON ONE SIDE THREE EXPERTS ON ANOTHER SIDE- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE EXPERTS- AND I KNOW THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS IS- IS STANDING IN BECAUSE THE AUTHOR- WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE IT TODAY- BUT I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS- BECAUSE AT FIRST GLANCE- AND SEEING THIS BILL- I WOULD SAY WILL- NO I'M I'M ABSOLUTELY- NO- BUT THEN- I HEARD FROM FOLKS WHO CAME- IN THE END AND WITH WHOM CALL FOLKS WHO AND THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN CHANGED- BUT BECAUSE OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS AND SOME PROGRAMS. AND SO I READING THE OPPOSITION LETTERS MOSTLY FROM A FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT- THERE WAS ONE IN REGARDS TO LSD. BUT YET I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY HERE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO A TO ASK THAT QUESTION OF AND IF TO FIND OUT WHAT IMPACT IS AND I GUESS IN LARGE PART OF LOOKING FOR SORT OF THE THOSE THE GOOD OUTWEIGH THE BAD AND HOW DO WE AND HO DO WE GET THERE- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GOOD OUTWEIGHED THE BAD WHAT I DO KNOW IS- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DRUGS OVERALL THIS- WHAT ARE CURRENTLY STATUS QUO. ISN'T WORKING THAT'S WHY A FEW YEARS AGO I VOTED FOR- DR EGGMAN'S- BILL- IN REGARDS TO A PILOT PROJECT IN- IN THE CITY COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO- AND WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THIS BEFORE ME NOW I'M THINKING EITHER DOES THE POSITIVES OUTWEIGH THE NEGATIVES BECAUSE IT'S TRUE THAT THERE IS SOME NEGATIVES I'M JUST WONDERING IF MAYBE AS A MEMBER WEEKS IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. SURE THANK YOU. PRESERVATION AND YES I'M FILLING IN FOR- SENATOR WIENER BUT I WILL TRY MY BEST. I WE ALSO MIGHT THE- WITNESSES HERE WHO CAN ALSO SHED SOME LIGHT ON SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS BUT- YOU KNOW I GET IT RIGHT YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL YOU THINK. AS A LEGISLATOR. AM I REALLY GOING TO DO THIS. YOU KNOW AND TO AND LEGALIZE SOME OF THE PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS ON THE FACE OF IT WHEN YOU SEE IT BUT THEN WHEN YOU START TALKING TO PEOPLE. MANY VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AMAZING. YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE HUNGRY FOR MORE THERAPEUTIC. RESOURCES THEY'RE DEALING WITH ANXIETY. AND DEPRESSION. AND HAVE TRIED MNY OTHER TYPES. OF MEDICATIONS AND THERAPEUTIC- RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM CURRENTLY BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING FOR THEM. AND SO I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THEIR TESTIMONY IS THE MOST POWERFUL TESTIMONY. FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL- AND I THINK THEY'RE HUNGRY FOR MORE OF THESE RESOURCES. ALSO YOU LOOK AT THESE THE PSYCHEDELICS THESE ARE NOT ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCES. YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK YOU DO HAVE TO WEIGH AT WHICH WE DO WITH EVERY BILL. DOES THE GOOD OUTWEIGH THE BAD. AND TO MEET THE EVIDENCE IS VERY CLEAR IN THIS CASE OF THIS BILL. THAT THE GOOD OUTWEIGHS THE BAD. AND THAT DECRIMINALIZING WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT SMALL AMOUNTS FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY. IS ONE WAY THAT I THINK WE CAN NARROWLY GIVE MORE RESOURCES TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. AND IT DEFINITELY YOU KNOW THESE TYPES OF PSYCHEDELICS HELP GET PEOPLE OFF OF HEAVIER DRUGS AND HARDER DRUGS DRUGS LIKE HEROIN. WHICH WE KNOW WILL HAVE A VERY DETRIMENTAL EFFECT TO OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE BOARD RURAL URBAN SUBURBAN. AND IF WE HAVE MORE OF THESE RESOURCES AVAILABLE HOPEFULLY WE CAN. WORK TO THAT END I WOULD ALSO JUST- I DON'T KNOW IF JUST SCHOOL OR ISMAEL ALI WANTS TO- HELP ANSWER ANY THOSE THE QUESTIONS WELL. HAPPY HAPPY TO- MISIA'S MALES MOVING TO THE TO THE MICROPHONE IF YOU HAVE. ANYTHING TO ADD TO JUST JUST IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE PHONE. PLEASE PLEASE. AFTER AFTER A SMELL A PLEASEPLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD. AFTERNOON SORRY. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION I UNDERSTAND THAT SO MUCH OF PUBLIC POLICY IS WEIGHING THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION THAT'S BEEN PAID TO THESE QUESTIONS. I THINK THE CORE THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT A LOT OF THESE BEHAVIORS ARE ALREADY OCCURRING A LOT OF THE HARMS THAT OCCUR FROM PSYCHEDELICS OCCUR BECAUSE OF AN INTEGRATED USE OR THESE THINGS THAT ARE RELATED TO. STIGMA TRAUMA IN DESPERATION A LOT OF THE SOCIAL HARMS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG USE IN GENERAL AND PSYCHEDELICS IN PARTICULAR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DESPERATION. I THINK FOR PEOPLE WHETHER THEY'RE VETERANS ARE OTHERS THE FEAR OF CRIMINALIZATION AND THE FEAR OF ARREST IS ONE OF THE MOST LIKELY DRIVERS FOR PEOPLE ACTUALLY GOING INWARD INTO INTERNALIZING THAT STIGMA AND REFUSING TO. ASK FOR HELP SO PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR ARE ACTUALLY EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE FEEL FREE TO STICK OF CRIMINALIZATION. I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD ALLOW MORE ROOM FOR THAT- HONEST EDUCATION TO OCCUR IF THAT FEAR OF ARREST WERE NOT ON THE TABLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- JESSE DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT IF YOU'RE STILL ON THE LINE. AND THAT IS A CHALLENGE WITH OUR PROCESS BECAUSE. ONCE YOU'RE GONE YOU'RE GONE SO- OKAY AND MAYBE IF I CAN'T ANOTHER ANOTHER QUESTION AND AGAIN THIS IS PART OF THE- ABA A WITH- WITH THIS- IN REGARDS TO THE THAT I'VE HEARD FROM VETERANS- I'VE GOT THE AND TWENTY PALMS THEM IN COURT BY A GROUND COMBAT CENTER- I AM SURROUNDED BY- SOME OF. THE MARINES- AND- AND RETIRED- MARINES- AND THOSE WHO HAVE GONE TO COMBAT I DO COME BACK WITH- THE TREMENDOUS- AGONY THAT THE PTSD THAT. THAT THAT AFFECTS THEM AND WEN YOU WHEN YOU HEAR FROM THEM- LIKE LIKE I HAVE LIKE YOU YOU HAD ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS- IT DOES WEIGH ON YOU AND I THINK- ABOUT ABOUT IT WHY CAN'T WE WHY I CAN'T WE HAVE A SUPERVISED IN CALIFORNIA WHY CAN'T WE HAVE. UNSUPERVISED YOU KNOW FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS- THAT CAN- THEY CAN SUPERVISE THIS TYPE OF CLINICAL A WORK WHAT WHAT IS IT WHAT WE HAVE TO JUST TO DECRIMINALIZE- THAT THESE. THESE- THESE SUBSTANCES. QUITE FRANKLY WE CAN AND WE SHOULD RAISE I MEAN. BUT THE REALITY MATTERS WE HAVE PEOPLE DYING EVERY SINGLE DAY RIGHT NOW. OF HEROIN OVERDOSES OF SUICIDE. OF DEPRESSION THAT'S IMPACTING THEM. AND IF WE CAN DECRIMINALIZE THIS PIECE OF IT AND START THAT PROCESS AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON- MORE REGULATED SETTINGS. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING- BUT THIS I THINK TAKING AWAY THE SORT OF CRIMINALIZATION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF POSSESSION I ALSO THINK WE'LL TAKE THIS OUT OF THE SHADOWS. AND INTO MORE OF THE MAINSTREAM AND THEN WE CAN CONSIDER FURTHER ADDITIONAL- REGULATORY LISTENING FOR THESE TYPES OF A- PSYCHEDELICS OKAY MR JUST WANTED IT ONE LAST THING IS UP TO- I'M STILL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS WITH THIS BILL- BUT I AM GOING TO DEVOTE TO MOVE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE AND RETAIN THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE AGAINST IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME MORE. QUESTIONS ANSWERED SHE- THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. ALSO RESPONDED THAT REALLY QUICK SEE MR TIGHTER. CAN I JUST RESPOND THAT MISTER CHAIR YEAH. JUST ONE LAST THING I THINK YOU KNOW. ON BEHALF OF. SENATOR WIENER AND MYSELF AS WELL. ALSO BE TO WORK WITH YOU IF THERE'S MORE LANGUAGE THAT MAKES YOU MORE COMFORTABLE WHEN THE BILL REACHES THE FLOOR. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF THE DEVICE YOU'RE ACTUALLY SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY ON THIS AND I APPRECIATE THE TURMOIL YOU EXPRESSED BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY THE INTERNAL TURMOIL I HAVE YET I REPRESENT A RELATIVELY- BLUER DISTRICT AND I THINK I HAVE CONSTITUENTS WHO WOULD VERY MUCH WANT TO SEE ME SUPPORT THIS. BUT FOR ME THIS IS ALSO BEYOND DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN OR ANY PARTISAN LINE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND YOU TRY TO. BEST COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT MAKES SENSE AND I GOTTA SAY IT'S- SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS A LACK OF THE SPECIFIC DATA YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK FOR. YET AT THE SAME TIME A LOT OF THIS FEAR THAT IS PLACED THAN US. WHEN YOU. SCRATCH THE SURFACE AND WHEN YOU LOOK INTO A DEEPER YOU SEE THAT IT REALLY ISN'T BASED ON A GREAT DEAL OF EVIDENCE IT'S ON ITS OWN. JUST YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS AGO WE KEPT ON HEARING FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THAT YOU KNOW DECRIMINALIZING. MARIJUANA AND CANNABIS IS GOING TO BE HORRIBLE FOR US I CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY THAT ACTUALLY WAS IN FAVOUR. WHAT'S SURPRISING TO ME IS. WE HAVE A BILL TODAY THAT SEVERAL DIFFERENT POLICE. AGENCIES ARE ACTUALLY SUPPORTING- THE FEAR WITH MARIJUANA WAS. YUP PART ONE CRIMES ARE GONNA GO UP THERE'S GOING TO BE ROBBERY THERE'S GOING TO BE. MANY DIFFERENT SMALL SMALLER RELATED THEFTS AND BURGLARIES AND ROBBERIES IT ACTUALLY WENT ON THE DECLINE IT'S ONLY GONE UP RECENTLY IN THIS LAST YEAR BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT INCREASE HAS NOTHING TO DO AS A DIRECT CORRELATION TO THE LEGALIZATION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN OREGON. EVEN THOUGH IT JUST PASSED LAST NOVEMBER. AND IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED AS OF JANUARY THERE IS NO. NO CREDIBLE DEDUCTION THAT THERE'S BEEN ANY INCREASE IN- ROBBERIES OR ANYTHING RELATED TO BECAUSE AS A SUBSET DO TO OTHERS I'M SORRY AS A SUBSET OF CRIME ACTIVITY DUE TO. THE LEGALIZATION OF THESE DRUGS AND AGAIN IT'S ONLY FOR A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS SO MAYBE A LITTLE OVER SIX MONTHS BUT AGAIN THERE IS NO CREDIBLE DATA THAT SUGGESTING IT. SO I KIND. IT'S DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME SOME OF THE INNER VOICES OF WANTING TO BE SAFE. AND WANTING TO TAKE THE SAFE ROUTE IN THIS ISSUE IN THIS INSTANCE. I NEVER HAD AN ISSUE SUPPORTING DECRIMINALIZING CANNABIS BECAUSE- LET'S FACE IT PEOPLE WHO USE CANNABIS ARE NEVER GOING TO WANT TO GET OFF THE COUCH. SO IT'S NOT GOING TO CREATE A PROBLEM. BUT- I DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS. WORKED OUT WITH THE AUTHOR- FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IF THIS WAS ONLY TO BE INTRODUCED AS A METAPHOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES- THERE WAS GETTING OUT THE OPPOSITION FROM THE HEALTHCARE. ARENA OR THE DOCTORS AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND. THAT'S WHY. THIS MEASURE WAS INTRODUCED IN A WAY WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO PROVIDE MICRO DOSES. SO THAT ITS PURPOSE IS SOLELY FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES FOR TO ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS WITH DEPRESSION OR OTHER ELEMENTS TO BE ABLE TO FIND RELIEF SO I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT IT. VERY- HESITANTLY AND THE- I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. ONCE IT COMES ON THE FLOOR BUT I DO WANNA I DO WANT THIS CONVERSATION TO GO FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO BE. THINKING ABOUT THIS IN A WAY OF HOW DO WE STOP JUST CRIMINALIZING THINGS BUT LOOKING AT TRYING TO. USE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX AILMENTS- SO WITH THAT THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR ON ON WORKING ON THIS- AND- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE AND- WILL MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR IN HIS AREA OF MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST BRIEFLY I SUPPORT THIS BILL WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT HI I THOUGHT WHAT ON EARTH AND WE PROPOSING HERE. LEGALIZING IT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BUY IT IN GETTING THE HIT GETTING IN THE HANDS OF. OUR YOUTH AND YOU KNOW A MILLION TALK ABOUT MY YOUTH BUT- IT WAS TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT HAVING THIS PRODUCT- READILY AVAILABLE TO OUR YOUTH IS NOT A POSITIVE THING BUT WE ARE DECRIMINALIZING POSSESSION BUT I CONCUR WITH MR MAYS I THINK THE REAL ISSUE. IS THAT IF THIS HAS A VIABLE PURPOSE I COULD HEAR FROM SOME THE WITNESSES. IT SHOULD BE- SANCTION FOR THE SALE YOU SHOULD WE SHOULD DO IT LIKE WE DID WITH MEDICINAL MARIJUANA FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS AND- GO GET A DOCTOR'S NOTE. AND THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN INSTANCES WHERE IS THIS IS SHOWN THERE HAS SOME VALUE SO I THINK THIS IS LITERALLY THE WRONG ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE LAST I GET THAT THE- AUTHOR WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE CRIMINALIZATION AND THE IMPACT THE SOME PEOPLE. COULD BE CHARGED TODAY WITH POSSESSION BUT THE REAL ISSUE OF THIS DOES HAS A SOCIETAL BENEFITS. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE ON THE OTHER PIECE OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY- ANYONE ELSE. YES MISS KOREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND TO THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE BROUGHT UP THIS DISCUSSION AND TO- THE ASSEMBLY% MEMBER FOR PRESENTING ON A BILL I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR BILL AND- I WISH THE SENATOR WAS HERE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HIM. A COUPLE OF TIMES ABOUT THIS BILL- YOU KNOW I E. I'M VERY CONFLICTED. I GENERALLY FALL IN THE CATEGORY OF WANTING TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO. PUSH FORWARD LEGISLATION THAT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ORIENTED THAT'S ABOUT REDUCING CAR SERRATION. THAT'S ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE AT THE END OF THE DAY RESTART THEIR LIVES. I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO SEE. MORE DRUGS IN MY COMMUNITY. WE ARE ALREADY DEALING WITH HUGE ISSUES RELATED TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS- SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS. AT THE- ABILITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING IN MANY CASES FOR FOLKS TO HAVE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WITH SOCIAL WORKERS WITH MENTAL HEALTH- EVALUATIONS THAT ULTIMATELY AT THE END OF THE DAY. HELP PEOPLE. MY QUESTIONS ARE STILL UNANSWERED IN TERMS OF. THE ACT OF BUYING AND SELLING IT'S STILL ILLEGAL. SO THE AMOUNTS THAT ARE ON HERE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ALLOWABLE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE- I WOULD NEED TO SEE THEM AND I SEE THE THERE ARE GROUNDS AND- FOR L. IS D. FOUR DMT. FOR- MOLLY ECSTASY MDMA SAYS THE M. T. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SOME OF THIS STUFF IS CERTAIN MUSHROOMS I FEEL VERY I FEEL REALLY- APPREHENSIVE OF PUSHING A PIECE OF LEGISLATION FORWARD THAT- DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN IN TERMS OF THE ACT OF THE SALE AND BUYING THE STILL ILLEGAL. AND SO YOUR STATE YOU ARE IN MANY WAYS PROMOTING AN UNDERGROUND ECONOMY OF DRUGS. I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT IN MY COMMUNITY- I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL I UNDERSTAND AND THANKFUL TO THE TESTIMONY EARLIER FROM THE VETERANS WHO ARE TRYING TO FIND DIFFERENT WAYS TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF PTSD THAT PROBLEM IN ITSELF IS THAT THE TUITION IS ONE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROBLEM ONE THAT WE SHOULD INVEST IN ONE THE SHOULD HAVE- PERFECT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN THE ROOM. TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE AND HELP VETERANS THAT NEED THOSE SERVICES. BUT IF YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT RIGHT NOW. THE BILL DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A CLINICAL SETTING. AND THAT YOU ARE ADVOCATING TO HELP THESE DRUGS TO SIMPLY BE ON THE STREET. I'M SORRY I JUST I CAN'T SUPPORT THAT AND I WANT TO FIND A PATHWAY THERE- ANOTHER COLLEAGUE MENTIONED MEDICINAL MARIJUANA MEDICINAL. TOOK TWENTY YEARS TO GET TO THAT LEVEL AND SURE WE WANT TO EXPEDITE THINGS AND MAKE SURE THAT THINGS MOVE FASTER BUT THERE WAS A CARD ASSOCIATED THERE WAS A DOCTOR ASSOCIATED THERE IS AN INCREASE OF USAGE TO NOW THAT ITS RECREATIONAL AND IT'S MORE ACCEPTABLE. BUT IT WASN'T JUST LET'S. LEGALIZE AND THAT FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENS IT WAS THERE WAS A PROCESS. AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROCESS IS HERE. I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN. HELP EDUCATE ME OR MAYBE THIS BILL JUST ISN'T REALLY FULLY THERE YET THE INTENT IS GOOD. BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE THAN NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THESE TYPES OF DRUGS. DON'T END UP IN THE WRONG HANDS AND ACTUALLY END UP HURTING PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDER TWENTY ONE. AS IT RELATES TO THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANTED A FOR CELEBRATION THE COMMENTS AND I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A MEMBER WHO ALWAYS- LEADS WITH YOUR HEART AND YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HELP PEOPLE AND YOU WANT TO HELP YOUR COMMUNITY- AND YOU CITED A COUPLE DIFFERENT- EXAMPLES HERE YOU DON'T WANT MORE DRUGS IN YOUR COMMUNITY. I DON'T WANT MORE DRUGS IN MY COMMUNITY EITHER BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO'S DYING ON THE STREETS DOING HEROIN. AND A VETERAN WHO'S- SEEKING THERAPEUTIC RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH PTSD. SAYING THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS. AND THESE TYPES OF A HOST ENGINES CAN ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES CAN HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE. DEALING WITH DRUG ADDICTION. YOU KNOW THE FDA IS CURRENTLY TRYING TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF LEGALIZING THIS. IT COULD TAKE A NUMBER OF YEARS. A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IN THE MEANTIME WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW WE HAVE PEOPLE. BEGGING FOR THIS TO BE A RESOURCE. AND I DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE BEGGING FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH. THE ISSUES THAT THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY AND NIGHT. AND SO IF WE CAN PROVIDE THAT PATH WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS. THERE WAS AN UNDERGROUND MARKET FOR VERY LONG TIME THERE'S STILL AN UNDERGROUND MARCH. YOU KNOW AND IT WAS ONLY ONCE WE HAVE THE POLITICAL COURAGE TO SAY LOOK AT WHAT THE RESEARCH IS TELLING US. ABOUT THIS. THAT WE WERE ABLE TO THEN SAY HERE'S A PATH FOR LEGALIZATION RIGHT SO YES WE SHOULD HAVE CLINICAL STUDIES. MANY THERAPISTS OFFER THAT TYPE OF STUFF RIGHT YES THE FDA SHOULD PURSUE LEGALIZATION AND THEY'RE DOING THAT AND THAT'S GONNA TAKE A NUMBER OF YEARS. BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SMALL AMOUNTS RIGHT FOR PERSONAL POSSESSION- YOU WOULD MENTION THE SORT OF UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THAT YOU'VE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. RIGHT NOW. AND IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT FOR AGAIN FOR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES THE STUFF CAN BE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THEN BY ALL MEANS I WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE THE TOOLS IN THEIR TOOL BOX THAT THEY HAVE AND YOU KNOW GET I'M NOT THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL SO I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS FOR YOU- BUT IT IS MY HOPE THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE CAN CONTINUE TO- DEFINED THIS BILL MORE SPECIFICALLY. I'D BE HAPPY AND I'M SURE SENATOR WIENER WOULD BE AS WELL TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU WITH MORE TO TIONAL CONCERNS TELL CRAFTED IN A WAY- BUT AGAIN I THINK IT THE GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THESE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE I GUESS WHAT I'M I'M THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WHAT I'M STILL NOT HEARING IS THE HOW. IF YOU ARE A VETERAN THAT NEED SERVICES. THAT WANTS TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF PTSD WHAT IF THE HOUSE. I'D LOVE FOR MY WITNESS TO IF THAT'S OKAY MISTER CHAIR PLEASE GO AHEAD- TO HAVE A- OUR WITNESS SPEAK TO THAT. THE SPANISH MAIL. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION THESE QUESTIONS- ALSO A TWO THINGS ONE REGARDING THE COMMISSION OF THE BILL WHICH IS- IN THERE I BELIEVE TO THINK THROUGH A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS REGARDING WHAT THAT MORE REGULATED STRUCTURE MIGHT LOOK LIKE- SO I DO THINK THAT SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS ARE RESPONDED TO BY AT LEAST THE EXISTENCE OF THAT AND AGAIN THE AMENDMENTS THAT CAME IN TODAY ALLOWED THAT TO BE A TIERED PIECE WHERE. THE FIRST ROUND OF IT IS MERELY EDUCATION AND HARM REDUCTION RESOURCES AND THEN THE SECOND BEING GOING TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE JUST ASK MORE AROUND REGULATED USE- OVERSIGHT AND SO ON- THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SELF ORGANIZING A LOT OF THESE VETERANS GROUPS THAT YOU'VE SEEN JOINT HAVE BEEN. HOLDING CIRCLES ARE HOLDING COMMUNITY CEREMONIES AT THEMSELVES SO RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED AROUND SHARED USE AND IT FACILITATED USE EITHER COMES FROM TRADITIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF AS JUST MENTIONED EARLIER CENTRAL OR SOUTH AMERICA. WHERE THESE. SUBSTANCES HAVE BEEN USING CEREMONIAL CONTEXT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND PEOPLE HAVE TRAINED AND TRAVELED AND TRAINED. TO DO THAT- OR IT RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF ISSUES REGARDING LICENSURE- AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY ANOTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THAT CONCERN FOR- CURRENTLY LICENSED FACILITATORS HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF FEAR. OF LIABILITY AND OTHER RELATED ISSUES SO THAT WAY IT'S BEEN HAPPENING IS THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN SELF ORGANIZING TO DO THESE CIRCLES. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD THE HEALING IS ON GOING AND PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THE PEOPLE INCLUDING SOME THAT WE SEE. ON THE STREET AS YOU MENTIONED YOU WERE DYING FROM HER AND ARE ALSO THOSE VETERANS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM PTSD. THOSE ARE NOT NECESSARILY DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AND THERE IS A NEED THAT'S A VERY EXTREME THAT'S VERY THAT'S VERY VISIBLE THROUGHOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK THANK YOU I DON'T I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT ACTUALLY ANSWERS MY QUESTION MY QUESTION IS. HOW HOW ARE YOU GETTING THIS POTENTIAL MEDICATION LET'S CALL IT MEDICATION FOR WHAT IT IS TO FOR ADDRESSING ISSUES. OF PTSD. WHAT IS THE HOW OUTSIDE OF GOING TO SOUTH AMERICA AND PARTICIPATING IN A- OF AN INDIGENOUS CEREMONY AND RITUAL THAT TAKES YEARS AND DECADES FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER DO ALONE. WHAT IF THE HOW AND IF I AND I THINK SERVE A COMMUNITY OF VETERANS FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. WHAT IS THE HOW OLD AND HOW AN INDIVIDUAL CAN GET A SEEK ASSISTANCE AND ACTUALLY BUY THESE DRUGS WHAT DOES THAT PROCESS LOOK LIKE ACCORDING TO THIS BILL. THIS BILL DOES NOT SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE PURCHASE PROCESS THAT EXPLICITLY AVOIDS THAT CONVERSATION EIGHT EXPRESSLY AVOIDS CREATING AN- ECONOMY A MARKET OUT OF IT. WHICH IS I BELIEVE WHAT THE COMMISSION IS INTENDED TO DO SO RIGHT NOW THE PURCHASE EVERYTHING LEADING UP TO THE PERSONAL POSSESSION REMAINS ILLEGAL- WITH THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND I APPRECIATE YOUR ADVOCACY I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SHARING RIGHT NOW IS THAT TRUTH THAT'S A VERY HARD FOR US TO MANAGE TO DEAL WITH I THINK. IF THIS BILL WERE A BILL THAT SAID WE ARE CREATING A PLATFORM IN WHICH IN CERTAIN CLINICS OR SETTINGS OR- TRUSTED CENTERS WITH PROFESSIONALS. THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN MOVE FORWARD I WOULD BE 1100% OKAY WITH THAT. BUT THE FACT THAT THE BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE CONTINUED ILLEGAL FAIL. I AM ONLY ADDRESSES ISSUES OF QUANTITY AMOUNTS ARE ALLOWABLE AMOUNTS THAT ARE CONTROLLED. A SUBSTANCE IN ORDER FOR YOU TO NOT BE ARRESTED COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS- I THINK IT IS IT'S A STEP FORWARD IN AT LEAST THE CONVERSATION- I JUST I'M NOT SURE THAT JUST LEGALIZING WITHOUT A PATHWAY. ON HOW WE ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT- IS THE RIGHT COURSE FOR RIGHT NOW. AND SO THAT'S- YOU KNOW I'M I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT THAT SOME. THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT. AND THERE ARE NEW METHODS THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED WHEN- RELATED TO ISSUES OF PTSD IN VETERANS THAT I AM 1100% IN SUPPORT AND WE HAVE SEEN THOSE STUDIES. BUT THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT. THIS THIS ADDRESSES A PORTION THAT CONTINUES TO ALSO INDICATE THAT THE SALE AND BUYING OF. THESE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES IS ACTUALLY STILL ILLEGAL. YEP I'LL LET YOU GO AHEAD THANKS. JUST ONE SUPER QUICK NO RESPONSE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT I'LL JUST NOTE THAT- WITH SOME OF THESE SUBSTANCES IN PARTICULAR THE PLANTS- I BELIEVE THAT HOME GROW IS ALSO PERMITTED SO THERE WOULD BE A LEGAL WAY TO CULTIVATE PLANTS AND FUNGI- THAT ERROR INCLUDED THAT OUR NUMBER OF THE SUBSTANCES AND THIS BILL SO THAT IS ONE WAY IN THAT. SAFE NON SALE NINE- IT ECONOMIC ACCESS MIGHT BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CULTIVATION OF SOME OF THESE SUBSTANCES AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK SOME OF THOSE ANSWERS COULD OR SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS COULD BE ANSWERED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU I MISS BURKE. ASSEMBLY THIS MAKES WILL ALSO I AM A FIRST NOT UNLIKE MY COLLEAGUE I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE AND HAVE HAD TO LEARN ABOUT THEM OVER THE OURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS OR SO- AND EVEN ON THE AMOUNT THAT FEW DID PUT THEM IN FRONT OF ME I WOULDN'T KNOW IF IT LOOK LIKE A LOT OR A LITTLE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU BUT- I WILL AND I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT I WAS SIMILAR. TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES IN THE FACT THAT I WOULD ORIGINALLY THIS THOUGHT THERE WAS JUST NO WAY I COULD VOTE FOR THIS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR. I AM THE AUTHOR AND THE NUMBER OF FOR THEIR AMENDMENTS THEY IT IT MADE IT MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND AND KIND OF GET TO GET TO THE PLACE WHERE I COULD I COULD SEE THAT THIS WAS NECESSARY I THINK IT HELPS FOR ME TO KNOW THAT THEIR IT IS UNDER FDA APPROVAL A LOT OF THESE DRUGS ARE. BEING REVIEWED BY THE FDA FOR THEIR CLINICAL PURPOSES I THINK THAT'S ESPECIALLY HELPFUL AND I DO THINK THAT THE SHARE PROVISION THAT THE CHAIR AND PUT IN PLACE THAT ACTUALLY DOESN'T NARAL WHAT SHARE MEANS AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE- HELPS ME UNDERSTAND THAT REALLY THE GOAL IS TO PAY FOR IT TO BE EXCHANGED WITH A CLINICIAN- ON A VERY SMALL LEVEL AND ON A MICRO DOES OR WHATEVER THE PROPER TERM WOULD BE ON ALL OF THESE DRUGS I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A STANDARD TERM ACROSS THE BOARD- BUT I DO THINK THAT THAT IS VERY HELPFUL TO KNOW THE FDA'S. IS IN THE PROCESS OF APPROVING A LOT OF THESE FOR THERAPEUTIC USE AND THAT THESE THESE DOSES ARE CONSIDERED MICRO. DOSE- IN THEIR SPECIALTIES. FOR ME. OBVIOUSLY DECRIMINALIZATION IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR MY COMMUNITY. OB I HAVE THE SAME ISSUES. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO OF DRUG USE IN MY COMMUNITY HOWEVER. I THINK THAT THE DEMAND TO CRIMINALIZATION AT THESE LEVELS I THINK IF. I CAN'T SEE AS BEING ACCEPTABLE THEN I DO THINK. THAT FOR THOSE WHO STRUGGLE WITH SOME OF THESE THERAPEUTIC ISSUES TO HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND WHATEVER VETERANS WHICH I THINK. OBVIOUSLY FIRST TIER VETERANS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING WE- PUT THEM IN THAT SITUATION. SO WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO CREATE ALLEVIATE THE PAIN THAT THEY HAVE IT INTO WORD. AND THE MENTAL ANGUISH THAT THEY AREN'T HAVE HAVE AND CONTINUE TO INDOOR. IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY. AND TO DO IT CAREFULLY LIKE I BELIEVE THIS BILL HAS NARROWED IT TO YOU. I THINK IS VITAL. I ALSO THINK IT'S- I WAS I WAS SAD TO HEAR SOME OF THE STORIES ABOUT THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE HAD TO SEND THEIR KIDS AWAY. OTHER COUNTRIES. IN THE MIDDLE OF KNOWING THAT THEY WERE GOING THROUGH THESE DAYS ADDICTIONS AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND HAVING TO SEND THEM. THEIR KIDS AWAY FROM THEM. THEIR FAMILIES I KNOW I DON'T LIKE SENDING MY KID TO DISNEYLAND. NOT TO MENTION CENTER OF THE COUNTRY WHEN SHE'S AT OUR WEAKEST I. GUESS I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT FOR OUR FAMILIES AND FOR OUR VETERANS. SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO GET TERE AND- IT'S TAKEN A LOT OF WORK FROM. THE STAFF HERE AND THE CHAIR BUT WITH THAT I. I'D LIKE TO SECOND THE BILL AND- I WILL BE SUPPORTING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ANYONE ELSE. AS FOR SAY THANK YOU- MISS WEEKS REPRESENTING THE BILL ON ON BEHALF OF SENATOR WIENER- IT DOESN'T JOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION- YOU KNOW I THINK SOME OF WHAT I'M HEARING FROM MEMBERS HERE IS ARE NOT UNLIKE THE CAN SOME OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE- I THINK WHAT IT WHAT WHAT IS DIFFERENT FOR ME. IS THE- IS THE GROUP WORKING GROUPS OF PEOPLE WORKING TO WITH FACILITATED. CARE FOR PEOPLE. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS LIKE GOING OUT ON THE STREET CORNER AND BUYING SOMETHING AND YOU KNOW WHATEVER AND THIS ISN'T EVEN THERE ISN'T EVEN A REAL THIS IS IN THE SALES OF THIS ISN'T THIS IS NOT. NOT THIS GROUP COMING TOGETHER AS- AND SELLING THIS TO PEOPLE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THIS IS WORKING. I THINK OF- YOU KNOW IT WASN'T. IT WASN'T JUST BUT BUT JUST THREE YEARS AGO MAYBE MAYBE FOR THAT THE FDA ACTUALLY APNA PROVED- A CANNABIS THROUGH A CANNABIS DERIVED- MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEIZURES IN YOUNG CHILDREN IT'S TAKEN. HOW LONG FOR THAT TO HAPPEN ANOTHER OTHERS OTHER THINGS ARE COMING ALONG SO ARE APPROVAL PROCESS IS REALLY REALLY CHALLENGING AND SO THE IDEA THAT A PHYSICIAN MIGHT ACTUALLY DO THIS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT IS- I CAN SEE WOULD BE OF CONCERN- SO FOR ME- THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS AND HEAR THOSE STORIES AND THE REALIZATION- I WAS CONVINCED. OF THE THERAPEUTIC VALUE OF MANY OF THESE SUBSTANCES AND THE ROLE THE IMPORTANT ROLE THEY CAN PLAY IN IN TREATMENT FOR A PTSD ANXIETY DEPRESSION FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND TO OTHER OTHER MODALITIES. IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE GO THROUGH TO GET TO THIS POINT AND AS YOU HEARD AS WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE FAMILIES. APPARENTLY PARTICULAR THEY WENT THROUGH EVERYTHING WITH THEIR WITH THEIR WITH THEIR SON TO TRY TO GET TO THIS POINT AND THIS WAS LIKE THE LAST RESORT AND IT MADE A DIFFERENCE AND TO ME THAT'S PRETTY THAT'S PRETTY COMPELLING. A MANY TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE BREADTH OF THE SCOPE STILL REMAIN AND AS SCOPE OF THE BILL STILL REMAIN. THE WHOLESALE DECRIMINALIZATION OF HALLUCINOGENIC FOR PERSONAL USE THAT RECEIVED APPROVAL OF THESE DRUGS. AND BY EXTENSION THE IMPLICATION THAT APPROVAL BRINGS. TO THE POTENTIAL INCREASED USE BY MINORS IS TROUBLING. I HAVE TO REFLECT BACK TO REMEMBER IN TALKING TO MY SON WHO IS NOW TWENTY FIVE. IN HIGH SCHOOL- MEMBER HEARING HIM SAY- I SAID YOU KNOW CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IT'S LIKE AND SAYS HE SAYS WHATEVER YOU WANT THAT. I CAN GET ANYTHING I WANT. AT ANY TIME. AT IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND SO THE IDEA THAT THIS IS YEAH THIS IS THIS IS OUT THERE IN COMMUNITIES NOW- THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT- THIS OF THIS FACILITATED USE I THINK IS A VERY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT. THAN THAN WHAT YOU MIGHT SEE ON THE STREET SO. I'M ALSO TROUBLED BY THE LACK OF PUBLIC AWARENESS AROUND HOW THESE. SUBSTANCES MIGHT AFFECT PERSONS AT RISK OF FOR MENTAL ILLNESS OR WITH A FAMILY FAMILY HISTORIES OF MENTAL ILLNESS. THE AMENDMENTS- AND THANK YOU- THROUGH- THANK YOU THROUGHOUT THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER THREE YOU SEE IS ME. TAKING COMMITTEE DAY- ADDING PERSON LIMIT FOR PERSONAL POSSESSION ADDING IN SOME HARM REDUCTION EDUCATION- FIRST RESPONDER TRAINING OR A BEGINNING. AND BUT THE VERY FACT WE'RE PROVING THESE DRUGS FOR PERSONAL USE AND REALLY EVEN. FOR FACILITATORS SUPPORTED USE BEFORE DPH HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE GUARDRAILS. FEELS PREMATURE TO ME. A LITTLE BIT- I'M HOPEFUL AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS. THE PROVIDE APPROPRIATE- STRUCTURES AND GUARDRAILS. I DO WANT TO IMPAIR AND REITERATE THOUGH HOW COMPELLED I WAS BY THE CASE MADE FOR DEBT THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS- THAT THESE HALLUCINOGENIC OFFER. FOR THOSE REASONS I SUPPORT THE DEATH THE BILL TODAY- WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THIS WEEK'S. I JUST WANT TO THANK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK ON THIS THANK- MY COLLEAGUES HERE FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION. WHETHER YOU ARE GOING TO MOVE THE BILL OUT VOTE TO VOTE OR NOT APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. YEAH I WILL SAY I THINK. ALL OF US HERE. REGARDLESS OF WHAT PARTY WE ARE WE CAME HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO. AND THIS IS WONDERFUL THE TOOLBOX THAT I BELIEVE. WE CAN EMPLOY THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE. RIGHT NOW THAT DESPERATELY NEED HELP IN ADDITION TO VETERANS THERE'S ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. USES BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST THE SYSTEM WITH WHICH THEY ARE OPERATING IN RIGHT NOW. SO THEY'RE SEEKING OTHER REMEDIES. TO BE ABLE TO HEAL FROM THOSE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. WE KNOW THAT THESE DRUGS ARE NOT ADDICTIVE. WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE DECRIMINALIZE THIS WE TAKE IT OUT OF THE SHADOWS WE PROVIDE MORE EDUCATION WE PROVIDE. A THERAPEUTIC SETTING FOR THIS THAT CAN BE ACTUALLY VERY POWERFUL AND IMPACTFUL IN PEOPLE'S LIVES WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AND STATES ARE CONSIDERING SIMILAR THINGS AS IS THE FTA. SO I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S CONVERSATION HERE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH WICKS- WITH THAT- WE WILL- WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER NAZARIAN THE SECOND BY MISS BURKE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES. MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY. ARAMBULA BIGELOW HELLO NO BURKE BURKE I CARILLO. CARILLO NOT VOTING FLORIDA. MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN NO. MCCARTY MCCARTY I NAZARIAN. NAZARIAN AYE. RIVAS. RIVAS NOT VOTING RODRIGUEZ. RODRIGUEZ NOT VOTING SANTIAGO. WALDRON WALDRON NO. FIVE TO THREE THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS WEEKS. BAKER THIS RUBIO YES PLEASE. IF ITEM NUMBER NINE SB THREE TEN. WITH THE MESSAGE CARE. AT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I AM PROUD TO PRESENT SB THREE TEN A CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP SAVE LIVES OF CANCER PATIENTS AND WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO CRITICAL MEDICATION TO THOSE THAT CAN AFFORD IT. FIRST I WANT TO NOTE THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIRED MEMBERS FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS ISSUE AND I ALSO WANT THANK GOD A CO AUTHOR SO I'M SOME WHO FIT IN THIS COMMITTEE- FOR SUPPORTING THIS ISSUE AS WELL THIS BILL CREATES A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW CANCER PATIENTS TO DONATE THEIR UNUSED MEDICATIONS TO PATIENTS IN NEED. THROUGH THEIR CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN TRAGICALLY A RECENT STUDY SHOWS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE REPORTED KNOWING OF AT LEAST ONE FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS WHO DIED AFTER NOT RECEIVING THE NEEDED MEDICATION TREATMENT DUE TO THE HIGH COST I KNOW ONE PERSON PERSONALLY THAT HAD OVER THREE AT THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS% WORTH OF MEDICATION. THAT ARRIVED AFTER HIS WIFE PASSED WITH BREAST CANCER AND HE WASN'T ABLE TO DONATE IT SO IT WAS LOST AT LEAST TWELVE OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY HAVE SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN PLACE AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S TIME THAT CALIFORNIA. JOIN THEM. IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE DONATION PROGRAM WILL REQUIRE A PATIENT PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE PHYSICIAN WILL BE THE PERSON WHO PRESCRIBED THE MEDICATION INITIALLY AND WILL BE ABLE TO ASSESS ITS INTEGRITY BEFORE DONATING IT. TO ANOTHER PATIENT. IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY TWO WITNESSES THAT ARE HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY. MY FIRST WITNESS WILL BE TESTIFIED REMOTELY. BE CARDENAS DUNCAN CANCER PATIENT FROM SAN LEANDRO. AND MY SECOND WITNESS WILL BE HONEST SAID SHORT ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ONCOLOGIST WHO'S THE SCHOOLS THE COSPONSOR OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I SEE- THE SHORT IN THE- GALLERY THERE IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD FIRST. I'M HAPPY TO DEFER TO THE PATIENT ON THE PHONE IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU SAID THAT BY THE I'M FINE WITH THAT TOO- SO WE'LL GO AHEAD- THEN TO THE PHONE LINES FOR OUR OUR- WITNESS IN SUPPORT THE- CARD IN THIS. THE. PLEASE GO AHEAD. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. WE'LL COME BACK THEN HOW ABOUT HOW BOUT NOW TO SET. SOUNDS GREAT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE A SAFE PATIENT AND PHYSICIAN DRIVEN CANCER SPECIFIC DRUG DONATION PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH WOULD YOU COULD HAVE ENHANCE PATIENTS ACCESS TO CARE REDUCE WASTE IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND PROVIDE AFFORDABLE TREATMENT TO UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. ASIANS ARE OFTEN PRESCRIBED COSTLY ANTI CANCER MEDICATIONS THAT OCCASIONALLY DUE TO NTOLERANCE OR SIDE EFFECTS GO UNUSED. BUT THESE UNUSED EXPENSIVE MEDICATIONS ARE OFTEN DISCARDED DUE TO A LACK OF SYSTEM TO REPURPOSE THE MEDICATIONS FOR OTHER NEEDY PATIENTS. FURTHERMORE THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE MEDICATIONS CAN TAKE WEEKS FOR PATIENTS TO RECEIVE THE MEDICATION IN START TREATMENT. IN CANCER CARE DELAYING TREATMENT CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR MANY PATIENTS. WE HAVE IMPLANTED INTO THE PROGRAM A MARRIED A PATIENT PROTECTIONS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PATIENT SAFETY IS OUR FIRST OBLIGATION. WE'RE COMMITTED TO THOSE SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT PATIENTS WILL WORK TO ENSURE THEY CAN HAVE TIMELY ACCESS TO THEIR NEEDED TREATMENT. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO STUDY FROM RESEARCHERS AT MEMORIAL SLOAN KETTERING BUT NEARLY THREE BILLION DOLLARS WAS LOST ANNUALLY AND WASTED CANCER DRUGS. EVEN WASTED CANCER MEDICATION REPRESENTS AN EXPENSE FOR CALIFORNIA PATIENT AND A LOST OPPORTUNITY FOR TREATMENT AND TIMELY TREATMENT. OTHER STATES WITH PROGRAMS IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. WILL HAVE SAFE PATIENTS IN THEIR STATES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE'RE EXCITED TO BE WORKING WITH THE SENATOR AND THE CO AUTHORS IN THE ROOM. TO BRING THIS INNOVATIVE PROGRAM TO CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF THE INCOME MEMBERS OF OUR PATIENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL GO BACK TO THE PHONE LINES OPEN. PLEASE GO AHEAD OF CHAIR YES. MEDICARE YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. THE CARD IN A SECOND POINT A PRIVILEGE I WOULD I COULD GET TO ON MUTE OKAY I THINK MY STATEMENT YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MEDICARE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS BEATRICE BY THE NEXT DOWNTURN I AM LIVING WITH CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA. I HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED SEVEN TYPE OF ORAL CHEMO MEDICATION. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT CERTAIN MEDICATIONS DID NOT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY AND HAVE TO BE STOPPED. DOING THIS CHANGES OF PRESCRIPTION I WAS NOT ABLE TO FINISH THE MEDICATION AND SEVERAL TIMES THEY WERE BILLS THAT COULD NOT BE USED IN OTHER WORDS FINISH THIS PRESCRIBE MEDICATION. AND HAVE TO BE DISCARDED. I ALWAYS FELT A SENSE OF GUILT TO DISCARD THIS MEDICATION WHAT IF THERE HAD BEEN A SYSTEM IN PLACE WHERE OTHER CANCER. PATIENTS COULD HAVE BENEFITTED. THE PRISON SYSTEM. AVERAGE COST WORK SIX THOUSAND OR MORE PER MONTH. I AM GRATEFUL THAT I HAVE MEDICAL COVERAGE AND DID NOT HAVE TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT. SENATOR RUBIO SB THREE TEN IF THE CENTRAL TO BECOME LAW. I READ THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL AND IN MY OPINION IT WILL BE IT WILL BE DOCUMENTED IT WILL BE WELL DOCUMENTED INCLUDING THE REGULATIONS AS TO HOW THIS DONATED MEDICATION WILL BE MONITORED AND SYSTEMS IN PLACE HOW IT WILL BE RECYCLED AND ENFORCE. THIS LEGISLATION WILL ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT AFFECT CANCER PATIENTS THEY LACK ACCESS TO CANCER MEDICATION. SO I FULLY REQUEST YOUR YOUR YES VOTE SO THAT CANCER MEDICATION CAN BE DONATED IN CANCER PATIENTS WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THIS MUCH NEEDED HELP BENEFIT. THANK YOU FOR PARKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IN ALLOWING ME TO MAKE MY PRESENT AGE SIX AND PATIENT THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.

BILL OF RIGHTS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH ME TO STRENGTHEN THE LANGUAGE OF THE RESOLUTION. WE ALL HAVE AGAIN BEEN TOUCHED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BY SOMEONE. THAT'S STRUGGLING WITH CANCER IN THE THANK YOUR VALLEY WE ARE SO LUCKY TO HAVE THE CITY OF HOPE RIGHT IN OUR BACKYARD. A DESIGNATED NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE. CANCER RESEARCH CENTERS LIKE CITY OF HOPE CONDUCT CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH TO DEVELOP NEW TREATMENTS AND CURES. UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY CANCER PATIENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM VULNERABLE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES STRUGGLE TO ACCESS THOSE LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS AND THE BEST CHANCE OF A CURE IS THE FIRST CHANCE FOR A CURE. WHICH IS WHY PATIENTS DESERVE INFORMATION ABOUT TREATMENT OPTIONS AND RELEVANT MEDICAL RESEARCH. THAT'S WHY I HAVE AUTHORED THIS CANCER PATIENT BILL OF RIGHTS THIS RESOLUTION IS SUPPORTED BY MANY PATIENT AND GREW UP PROVIDER GROUPS THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY THE CHRONIC CARE COALITION AND MORE. THE RESOLUTION HAS OVER THIRTY BIPARTISAN CO AUTHORS AND THERE IS NO OPPOSITION. ON THE PHONE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ARE TWO WITNESSES IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE DR JOSEPH ALL BERNATH. THE VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND SENIOR MEDICAL DIRECTOR AT CITY OF HOPE AND COLMA MAKE DAL A CANCER PATIENT AT CITY OF HOPE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD- CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE I AM DOCTOR JOSEPH ALBURNUS. I NEED A COLLEGES- AT THE CITY OF HOPE IS SERVICE BASED PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS. AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTION THE DEPARTMENT OLOGY. I APPRECIATE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AND PAPERMASTER ELEVEN WHICH CLAIMED SIX PRINCIPLES THAT MAKE UP THE CANCER PATIENT BILL OF RIGHTS. THE CITY OF HOPE IS A SPONSOR OF SCR ELEVEN AND WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT ALL CANCER PATIENTS SHOULD BE AFFORDED APPROPRIATE CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME. AND INSTITUTIONS WITH THE REQUISITE EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE THAT CARE. APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER ANNUALLY. EACH YEAR THOUSANDS OF THESE CANCER PATIENTS ARE EITHER MISDIAGNOSED PLACED IN TREATMENT REGIMENS. INAPPROPRIATE OR INEFFECTIVE FOR THEIR CONDITION. AND ABSTRACT PERCET OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY REPORTED THAT ABOUT CALIFORNIA. DO NOT RECEIVE CARE THAT'S CONSISTENT CLINICAL GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE CANCER NETWORKS. OF CANCER SCIENCE ADVANCES MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS CHILLERS ARE AVAILABLE THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THOSE ADVANCES AND PENSION ACCESS TO GOOD QUALITY HEALTHCARE. THE CAN SAVE LIVES. CANCER CURES INVOLVING AND THIS REQUIRES ONGOING ACCESS FOR PATIENTS TO THE MOST RECENT THERAPEUTICS AND CARE TECHNOLOGY. THE CONSEQUENCES OF LIMITED OR DELAYED ACCESS TO PICK UP YOUR TREATMENTS ARE SIGNIFICANT. WE NOT ONLY TO MISDIAGNOSIS. IT'LL TO MISTREATMENT THAT CAN LEAD TO UNEXPECTED UNNECESSARY EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMOTHERAPY SUFFERING ONE PREVENTABLE DEATH. MANY CANCER PATIENTS CALIFORNIA- THE DEPARTMENT OF FOR NOT BASED UPON CURRENT CAN DOCTOR. AND MANY OF THESE ARE STORE CLEAN UNDER COULD WELL LIKE TO HAVE FORCED OUTCOMES AND TREAT THE DR THAT PARKS GUIDE. TWO TWENTY TO THIRTY PROTECT USING. MEDICAL BENEFICIARIES WERE ALSO MOST LIKELY TO HAVE WORSE SURVIVAL OUTCOMES AND GAPS CARE BASED UPON THE NEED TO IMPROVE CANCER CARE EQUITY IN CALIFORNIA A COALITION OF PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS PROVIDERS HAVE COME TOGETHER WITH THE SUPPORT OF SENATOR RUBIO TO DEVELOP A CANCER PATIENT BILL OF RIGHTS. DEMONSTRATING THAT'S YOUR ELEVEN HAVE YOU PROVED OUTCOMES COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO PARTICIPATION IN CLINICAL TRIALS AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY ONLY 8% OF CANCER PATIENTS EVER. PARTICIPATE IN A CLINICAL TRIAL THIS IS NOT DRIVEN BY CHOICE ONCE WAS PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED REVIEW INVOLVING RESEARCHERS FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. AND THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY. NOT SPAULDING NINE THOUSAND CANCER PATIENTS AND FOUND THAT OVER HALF OF PATIENTS. HAVE A CLINICAL TRIAL AVAILABLE TO THEM AFTER INSTITUTION. ONE AVAILABLE A MAJORITY OF CANCER PATIENTS FIFTY FIVE POINT 1% TO CREATE A PRETTY BIG CLINICAL TRIALS. WE BELIEVE THAT YOUR ELEVEN HIGHLIGHTS THE ETHNIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN CANCER OUTCOMES AND PROMOTE ACCESS TO CUTTING EDGE TREATMENTS AND CLINICAL TRIALS. FOR CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE AND DISADVANTAGED CANCER PATIENT. APPRECIATE SENATOR RUBIO'S LEADERSHIP IN ADVOCATING FOR CANCER PATIENTS CALIFORNIA AND WE VERY STRONGLY SUPPORTER INTRODUCTION OF THIS. YEAR ELEVEN THANK YOU SO MUCH.

BY ALLOWING THEM TO SET THEIR YEARS SIXTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE FISHING SEASON. WITH A LOSS OF MULTIPLE FISHING VESSELS AND LIVES ON THE WEST COAST IN RECENT YEARS TAKING ACTIONS THAT CAN IMPROVE OUR MEMBERS SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT. AND INCREASED PRE SOAK PERIOD FOR THE DUNGENESS CRAB FISHING GROUNDS WILSHIRE FISHERMEN ARE FOR THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEPLOY THEIR FISHING GEAR IN RESPONSE VARIABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS.

MOVING ON NOW TO ITEM-NUMBER SEVEN- SENATOR PAM SB. FIVE TEN. RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- BEFORE I BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ME TO TAKE AMENDMENTS TO DELETE QUOTE UNVACCINATED QUOTE IN THE DEFINITIONS OF SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT PLANS ARE NOT RELIEVED OF COMPLYING WITH FEDERAL LAW AND GUIDANCE. THESE AMENDMENTS ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THE JULY SIX AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN TO TE FINE DIAGNOSTIC AND SCREENING TESTING BASED ON CDC GUIDELINES MAYBE MORE LIMITING THAN INTENDED INTENT IS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE UNDER THE- FCRA AND THE CARES ACT MORE WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND YOUR STAFF WILL BE NECESSARY TO REDEFINE THESE DEFINITIONS. IN FACT- I BELIEVE A MOCK UP TO SENT TO THE STAFF CORRECT ANSWER SB FIVE TEN REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO COVER COVER NINETEEN TESTING AND VACCINATION WITHOUT COST SHARING A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FROM BOTH IN NETWORK AND OUT NO OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS DURING THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THESE PROTECTIONS REMAIN FOR IN NETWORK TESTING AND VACCINES FOLLOWING THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THIS BILL ALSO PROHIBITS BALANCE BILLING FOR PROVIDERS FOR KOBE NINETEEN TESTING IMMUNIZATIONS EVEN AFTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY EXPIRES. LASTLY WE CAN ALREADY TAKE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC AND PUT A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE THAT ALLOW FEDERALLY APPROVED TESTING ANY MUSICIANS WITH NO COST SHARING FOR A FUTURE PANDEMIC. WELL WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS WE ARE STILL WORKING TOWARD VACCINATING MORE OF CALIFORNIANS FOR THE GENERAL FOCUS AND PRIORITIES ARE ENSURING EVERYONE CAN GET VACCINE WE CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF ENSURING EVERYONE ALSO HAS. ACCESS TO COVER NINETEEN TESTING AND VACCINATIONS WITH NO OUT OF POCKET COSTS THAT'S WHY SB FIVE TEN IS NEEDED NOW THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENT CLEAR LAWS REGARDING COVER NINETEEN TESTING AND IMMUNIZATIONS PROTECT CONSUMERS. BUT THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE AND LEAVE US WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SENATOR PAN WE'LL GO TO OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT ON THE PHONE- WHENEVER YOU'RE READY OPERATOR PLEASE. OPEN THE LINES FOR THE WITNESSES. ALL LANES ARE OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BRANDON MARCHING WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I'M MORE PROUD SPONSORS OF SB FIVE TEN WHICH REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO COVER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TESTING ACTIVATION AND RELATED SERVICES TO PREVENT OR MITIGATE A PANDEMIC DISEASES SUCH AS CHOLERA NINETEEN WITH NO COST SHARING FOR PATIENTS OR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY GOVERNANCE AND DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLE THAT NINETEEN P. DEMOCRATIC EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND HELP BEGIN THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO COVER NINETEEN. IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE TESTING TREATMENT AND VACCINATIONS FEDERAL AND STATE POLICIES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED TO MANDATE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE WITHOUT COST SHARING AND MANY DIRECTIVES HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND DEPARTMENTAL GUIDANCE. CDI PUBLISHED GUIDANCE OUTLINING REQUIREMENTS ON INSURERS REQUIRING INSURERS TO COVER TESTING AND SCREENING REGARDLESS OF NETWORK STATUS AND ENSURE HER RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT OF THE WAY FOR COST SHARING AMOUNTS PROVIDERS. BY CONTRAST THE GMAC RELEASED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WHICH CREATED A TIER SYSTEM BASED ON WHETHER A PATIENT HAS SYMPTOMS OR THEIR EMPLOYMENT SECTOR AND SCATTERS WHEREBY THERE WERE DIFFERENT CRITERIA FOR TESTING LG BILITY WHETHER PATIENT COST SHARING IS ALLOWED AND WHETHER TO PAY PRIOR AUTHORIZATION MAY BE REQUIRED FOR EACH TIER. EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WERE LATER REPEALED AND REPLACED WITH A MORE STREAMLINED WITH A MORE STREAMLINED APPROACH BUT STILL INCONSISTENT WITH PDI AND SOME FEDERAL GUIDANCE. SB FIVE TEN IF NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE FEDERAL STANDARD AT A MINIMUM IS MAINTAINED ACROSS HEALTHCARE REGULATORS IN CALIFORNIA THE PATIENT CAN RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED IN A TIMELY FASHION WITH NO OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND PHYSICIANS MAY RECEIVE FAIR AND REASONABLE CONGRESS COMPENSATION FOR THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE IT DURING THE CALL THE NINETEENTH ENDEMIC. THE QUESTION REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL ALSO POLITICAL THE NINETEEN TAX THAT SUGGESTIONS PERFORM. FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND SCREENING PURPOSES. COVERED CONTINUES TO NEEDED MONITOR AND CONTROL THE SPREAD OF DISEASE MY- ANY. THAT EXIST ON OUR PER FOR DIAGNOSE AND HEALTH. I SB FIVE TEN LOCAL US FOR FUTURE OP BUT BUILDING ON MY SKIN LEARNT YOUR- AND SETTING COVER I'M NOT REQUIRED TO FOR TESTING ON THE TO MAKE SURE. AT A TIME WHEN HEALTH IN A HAVE LAID BARE IN OUR CARE TO LOW JUST. SB FIVE TENANTS ALL PAGE HAVE ACCESS TO THANK COVERAGE COKE. VACCINATION TESTING. DEMAND BONTA THE SIMPLE MEASURE WHEN I RESPECTFUL REQUEST YOUR I. BUILT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE ON TO A NEXT WITNESS IN SOME. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER DIANA DOUGLAS FOR HEALTH ACT THE CALIFORNIA THE STATEWIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB FIV TEN SB FIVE HUNDRED ELIMINATE THE BURDENS OF COST SHARING AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION ASSOCIATED WITH CUP IN NINETEEN TESTING AND VACCINATION FOR CALIFORNIANS IN THE COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET. COMBINATION OF FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL GUIDANCE AND REGULATORY ACTION PATHWAYS CONTOURING FOR COCA NINETEEN TESTING AN IMMUNIZATION HOWEVER THE PATCHWORK OF POLICIES THAT OFTEN BEEN INCONSISTENT AND PROVEN CONFUSING FOR CONSUMERS BUT COVERAGE FOR CAPPING PREVIOUSLY BASED ON A WEB OF CONFUSING FACTORS INCLUDING OCCUPATION EXPOSURE AND SYMPTOMS. DESPITE LATER CLARIFICATIONS ON COVERAGE AND INCREASED CONSISTENCY AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS REMAIN UNDERSTANDABLY CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT OVER LATER PEOPLE IF THEY GET TESTED FOR OR VACCINATED AGAINST COPA NINETEEN. THE VACCINES ARE THANKFULLY WIDELY AVAILABLE THESE DAYS IS STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE TO GET MORE PEOPLE VACCINATED AND BRING US CLOSER TO FULL COMMUNITY IMMUNITY WE CANNOT AFFORD FOR VACCINE ACCESS TO BE HAMPERED BY CONFUSION OVER COST SHARING OBLIGATIONS OR BY THE NEED TO FIND IN NETWORK PROVIDERS. SPECIALLY FOR CALIFORNIANS ARE MOST VULNERABLE VULNERABLE COMMUNITY SB FIVE TEN WILL HELP CLEAR FINE ASSURE CALIFORNIANS THAT WHEN THEY NEED TESTING IT WILL BE COVERED NO MATTER WHAT. WHEN THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET IMMUNIZED THEY CAN JUMP ON THAT CHANCE WITHOUT WORRIES ABOUT WHO WILL PAY. THE BILL ALSO ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK THAT WE WON'T HAVE A REPLAY OF THE CONFUSION WE FACED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF ON THE OFFENSIVE FUTURE PANDEMIC. FOR THESE REASONS HEALTH ACCESS SUPPORTS SB FIVE TEN IN RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR EYES OUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE TO. IN OFF. SO WHEN THEY READY- JEFF HOW. AND STEPHANIE WALKEN'S WHENEVER YO'RE READY PLEASE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE GEN HAMPER CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS AND THE REGRETTABLY WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE TEN ELECTED AMENDED. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE STAFFER ENGAGING WITH UP ON THE BILL. FIRST WE WANT TO SAY THAT OUR NUMBER HEALTH PLANS ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND EVEN PRIOR TO THE FEDELI AT THE FEDERALLY ISSUED PUBLIC HEALTH GOTTEN MANY OF OUR MEMBERS WERE TAKING PREEMPTIVE DESPITE OF ACTION. TO HELP CURB IS RADICAL THE NINETEEN. THROUGHOUT THE LAST YEAR A HALF HELP ME THE WORK IN. WITH PROVIDER AND REGULATORS ENSURE THAT THE TESTING IDENTIFIED UNIVERSALLY. AND CONSISTENTLY EVEN WHEN I DIED HAS SHIFTED. HOWEVER WE ARE STRONGLY CONCERNED SB FIVE AND WOULD RETROACTIVELY FORCED HEALTH PLANS TO COMPLY WITH A NEW STANDARD THAT WAS NOT IN EFFECT ON MARCH FOURTH OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE BELIEVE THAT RETROACTIVELY FORTY HELP PLANT COMPLY WITH THE LAW THAT WAS NOT IN EFFECT AT THE TIME IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY BAD HOLD PUBLIC POLICY. MORE IMPORTANTLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE RETROACTIVITY PROVISIONS OUTLINED IN THE CELL OF VIOLATE THE CONTRACT CLAUSE. IN ARTICLE ONE SECTION NINE OF CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE ONE SECTION TEN OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. THE STATE OR FEDERAL CONSTITUTION EXPLICITLY CLEAR. THAT A LOT IMPAIRING EXISTING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO THEM CONSTITUTIONAL. SB FIVE TEN IN ITS CURRENT FORM SHIFT THE COST TO COVER NINETY TESTING RELATED SEARCHES THE PLAN. EVEN MORE A PRE EXISTING CONTRACT REQUIRES THE PROVIDER TO COVER THAT COST. THE US THE BILL EFFECTIVELY NULLIFIED. EXISTING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PLAN PROVIDERS WHERE MY PROVIDER TACKY TRACK. WHICH I ACTUALLY AGREED TO PAY FOR THE COST OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST SHIFTING MANDATE NINETY FIVE AND- I AM PROVIDER CONTRACTS WHICH DELEGATE TO THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER THE RESPONSIBILITY PAYING THE COVER NINETEEN DIAGNOSTIC TESTING RELATED SERVICES. DELEGATION OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES CONTAINED IN PLAN PROVIDER CONTRACT INCLUDING CAPTIVE ARRANGEMENT IT'S PART OF A CAREFULLY BALANCED ALLOCATION ARREST AT THE CENTRAL TO THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT FEEL UPSET THIS ARRANGEMENT AND RESPECT THE REQUESTED RETROACTIVITY PROVISION BE REMOVED FROM THE BILL. AMONG OTHER THINGS WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE FIVE TEN YEARS RETROACTIVELY OBLIGATE PLANT INSURERS REIMBURSE PROVIDERS ON THE POTENTIALLY LAW COST SHARE FROM THE START OF THE OF THAT. GENERALLY CLEAR PUBLIC HELP MAKE AMERICAN THING. WE UNDERSTAND IS EMERGENCY HAS CREATED FINANCIAL CHALLENGES% FOR SOME PROVIDER PRACTICE WHICH IS WHY HEALTH PLAN SET UP MEET THE MOMENT BY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDERS WHERE FEASIBLE INAPPROPRIATE. HOWEVER WE. ARE UNCLEAR HOW THIS SPECIFIC PROVISION WOULD. ACT WORK IN THE CONFINES OF THE STATE LAW. PLEASE RE THE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THAT FIVE LETTERS. AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YEAH OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE ONE MORE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. NUMBER SEVEN WATKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF OUR THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS WITH WITH RESPECT SB FIVE TEN. LIKE ECHO MY COLLEAGUES' COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF APPLYING THE BILL RETROACTIVELY. AS WELL AS HIGHLIGHT FOR USE AND ADDITIONAL CONCERNS WE HAVE SPECIFICALLY WE ARE CONCERNED THAT SB FIVE TEN DOES NOT ESTABLISH A CLEAR METHODOLOGY FOR REIMBURSING OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS. AND IT'S ALSO INCONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW. THE BILL REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO REIMBURSE OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS FOR ALL TESTING ITEMS OR SERVICES AT A REASONABLE RATE HOWEVER FEDERAL LAW DICTATES THAT THERE IS NO NEGOTIATED RATE. BUDGETS FOR OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT IS AT THE CASH PRICE UNLESS THE PLAN NEGOTIATED A LOWER RATE WITH THE PROVIDER. THE KERR EFFECT REQUIRES PROVIDERS TO POST THE CASH PRICE TAG ON THEIR PUBLIC WEBSITE. AND AUTHORIZES THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO IMPOSE IN MONETARY PENALTY OF UP TO THREE DOLLARS PER DAY. ON ANY PROVIDER WHO FAILED TO DO SO. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS CRITICAL THAT A REASONABLE MARKET BASED PRICING BENCHMARK BE ESTABLISHED FOR CAT MINISTER OUT OF NETWORK. TO ENSURE AGAINST PRICE GOUGING WHICH UNFORTUNATELY HAS BEEN A FAIRLY COMMON OCCURRENCE SINCE. THE BEGINNING OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. FURTHERMORE WE BELIEVE PROVISIONS ADDRESS FUTURE. CONTAINED IN THIS BILL. WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT. WHEN OR WHERE THE NEXT GLOBAL TOWN PANDEMIC BOOKER AND STATUTORILY DEFINING PARAMETERS FOR FUTURE PANDEMIC WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT TESTING PRACTICES TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE VACCINES AVAILABILITY IS. IS CERTAINLY TROUBLESOME AND COULD ULTIMATELY COMPLICATE ANY FUTURE RESPONSES. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE AND PRANKS THAT RESPECTFULLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORED THE BILL. FOR TODAY THANK YOU.

SEVEN ONE SEVEN ONE USED YOUR ONE VOTE SHORT WE HAVE MEMBERS MISSING SO- WILL LEAVE THAT BILL ON CALL ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WANT TO SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT AS AREMINDER AS PART EARLIER COMMENTS THIS IS POOR PRESENTATION OF AND TESTIMONY ONLY NO VOTE WILL BE TAKEN TODAY AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY CENTER ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT. THE BILL THAT'S ABOUT PATIENT ADHERENCE TO PRESCRIBED COVERED MEDICATIONS IT'S ALSO ABOUT PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DIABETES HIGH CHOLESTEROL ARTHRITIS. AND MANY OTHER DISEASES AS WELL SOME MORE RARE THAT REQUIRE ONGOING MEDICATION AND FOR SOME SUPPLIES IN ORDER TO KEEP THE CHRONIC CONDITION UNDER CONTROL. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. IN MANY FORTY ARE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS. THE THERE ARE PLANS OF MEDICAL DEDUCTIBLES WELL OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED- DOLLARS. AND PHARMACY DEDUCTIBLES OVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH MEANS THE PENDING ON THE BENEFIT DESIGN PATIENTS MUST PAY EVERY YEAR ALL MEDICAL PHARMACY EXPENSES UP TO THE DEDUCTIBLE. BEFORE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO PAY COPAYS FOR COVERED SERVICES. FACT ACCORDING TO THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION AN AVERAGE PERSON WILL HIT THEIR DEDUCTIBLE IN LATE MAY WHICH MEANS THEY WILL PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR SERVICES FOR THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF THE YEAR BEFORE THEIR PLAN BENEFITS KICK IN. A PERSON WITH ONE OR MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS MAY MEET THEIR DEDUCTIBLE SOONER BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO GO FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING THEIR PLAN BENEFITS MEANING THEY ARE PAYING OUT OF POCKET. FOR THE ENTIRE COST OF THE MEDICATION. AND OF THE OUT OF THE MONEY. THEN FORTUNATELY THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET THE MEDICATION. SONJI SIMILAR TO BEING UNINSURED BEGINNING. MANY STUDIES SHOW THAT PATIENT NOT ADHERENCE TO PRESCRIBE MEDICATION LEADS TO POOR THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES INTROGRESSION DISEASE THAT'S ESTIMATED TO BE BILLIONS IN AVOIDABLE HEALTH CARE COST. AND CERTAINLY OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL COST THE HEALTH COSTS AS WELL IN SOCIETAL COSTS. ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE IMMEDIATE SO THE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING ADHERENCE MAY NOT BE THE BIGGEST CONCERN. FOR SOME PLAYERS HOWEVER THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE LONG TERM COSTS THE POOR OUTCOMES EXCEEDS THE COST MEDICATIONS MANY CHRONIC ILLNESSES. BACK IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED A HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OF AVOIDABLE HEALTHCARE COSTS HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO NOT ADHERENCE IN THE UNITED STATES ANNUALLY REPRESENTING 3210% OF TOTAL. YOU HEALTHCARE COSTS. REDUCING OUT OF POCKET COSTS LEAD TO BETTER MEDICATION ADHERENCE CROSS MANY DIAGNOSES IN FACT THERE'S A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MAGNITUDE OF PATIENT COST SHARING IN THE LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE. I KNOWLEDGE OF THE TO BERMAN ALICE'S ESTIMATES A SIGNIFICANT COSTS BUT- IT THAT'S F. BUT ALSO ESTIMATES A HUNDRED TWO MILLION DOLLARS REDUCED COST SHARING FOR PEOPLE CRIED DISEASE. BECAUSE THE BILL. STATE COVERS OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEDICATIONS TO BURKE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO COME UP WITH AN OFFSETTING ESTIMATE SO THE NET COST INDIA ANALYSIS IS LIKELY INFLATED. ADDITIONALLY AS I MENTIONED MANY OF THE COST SAVINGS OCCUR OVER TIME AND NOT NECESSARY IN THE FIRST YEAR OF WHICH IS WHEN. THE TROOPER WHAT DID YOU BIRTH ESTIMATE INCLUDES UNDER REPORT. AS A REMINDER THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE COPAYS ELIMINATES THE DEDUCTIBLE. THAT UP FRONT COST FOR CHRONIC DISEASE MEDICATIONS AND SOME SUPPLIES. PATIENTS WILL STILL HAVE TO PAY COPAYS AND THEY'RE PUT PLANTS CAN STILL USE COPAYS AS A MATTER OF MINUTES. METHOD OF CONTROLLING UTILIZATION. YEAH I DO I RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD. I'D WITH THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO THE CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH- THE CHAIR- SEVERAL AMENDMENTS WERE REQUESTED- FIRST OF ALL- IN ORDER TO NARROW THE BILL- E HAVE TO IT I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT AMENDMENT THAT THIS WOULD ONLY APPLY TO GROUP PLANS. NOT TO INDIVIDUAL PLANS PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE NOT TO HAVE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN. WHERE IS IN A GROUP PLAN THEY MAY BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN ONLY GET A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN THAT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT'S OFFERED. AND IN FACT BECAUSE IF THAT'S WHAT'S OFFERED TO THEM AND THAT'S THE ONLY CHOICE THEY HAVE BEEN FORTUNATELY THEY CANNOT GO OFF THE CALVET CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY WOULD NO LONGER GET THE SUBSIDY TO PURCHASE THAT'S A FOUR EIGHT LOWER INCOME WORKER- THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM COVERED CALIFORNIA TO PERHAPS FROM. A PURCHASE A PLAN THAT DOESN'T HAVE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE THEY WOULD HAVE THAT SUBSIDY IN THEIR STOCK WITH THE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN. IN ADDITION I ALSO AGREED TO A SUNSET SO WE CAN SEE THE IMPACT I BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR YOUR SUNSET IN AN EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE BILL. THE PLACE WHERE I THINK UNFORTUNATELY- WE REMAINED AND DISAGREEMENT IS- THE IDEA OF ACTUALLY SELECTING DISEASES- THAT WOULD COVER FOR THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE THAT- THERE'S A DESIRE TO AGAIN. TRY TO REDUCE THE- PERHAPS THE COST OF THE BILL BUT I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT. WHEN I. STARTED THIS BILL. BOTH THE SUPPORTERS BUT INCLUDING THE OPPOSITION TO HEALTH PLANS WHO ARE AND FORTY OPPOSED TO THE BILL. HAVE BOTH EXPRESSED TO ME THEY DIDN'T WANT TO APPROACH. CHRONIC DISEASE MEDICATION DEDUCTIBLES ON THE DISEASE BY DISEASE BASIS THEY WANTED A POLICY THAT CAR CUT ACROSS. FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE CRIED DISEASES. WHO NEED TO BE ON THEIR MEDICATION AND NOR TO KEEP THEMSELVES HEALTHIER SO THEY DON'T HAVE EXACERBATIONS. AND IT IS. TREMENDOUSLY CHALLENGING TO SAY WELL THEN WHICH DISEASES AND CERTAINLY YOU HAVE BEEN OFFERED SAY WELL WHY WE PICKED THE TOP FOUR FIVE YOU KNOW THE CDC. BUT THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE. MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION SO WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE SCHIZOPHRENIA. WHO NEEDS THEIR MEDICATION SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE A STABLE HOME AND GO TO WORK SO THAT THE HOUSE ACTIVATIONS ARE SOME OF BI POLAR. WHAT ABOUT AIDS PATIENTS. WHO ARE WHO ARE HIV PATIENTS WHO NEED TO HAVE WHO ARE CHRONIC MEDICATIONS TO CONTROL HIV. WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE WHO HAS A NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION THAT AGAIN REQUIRES ONGOING TREATMENT FOR THEM OR FOR THEM NOT ONLY OF COURSE TO TREAT THEIR CONDITION BUT ALSO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO FUNCTION. AND EVEN HOLD THE JOB SO WE CAN'T THERE'S NUMEROUS CONDITIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AT THAT OFFICE THE SAME PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU'RE IN A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CASH ON HAND S IF YOU'RE TO LOOK AT LOWER WAGE WORKER. AND THE ONLY CHOICE YOU HAVE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN THAT HAS A HIGH. PHARMACY COPAY. THEN ESSENTIALLY YOU ARE OUT OF LUCK IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO PAY FOR YOUR MEDICATION TELL YOU SAVE ENOUGH MONEY. AND INSTEAD WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU STOP TAKING YOUR MEDICATION. AND WITH ALL THE CHARACTERS THAT COME INCLUDING BY THE WAY MAYBE ACTUALLY COVER YOUR DEDUCTIBLE BECAUSE YOU END UP IN THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. AND NOW YOU FIND YOURSELF SPENDING SO MUCH NOW YOUR PASTOR DEDUCTIBLE. I THINK THAT IS NOT THE PRO TO UNDERTAKE- WE WENT AHEAD AND THINK ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW CERTAINLY HAD BEEN OPEN AND APPRECIATE DISCUSSION THEY HAD ABOUT THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE- NARROW THE BILL BUT- I ALSO DON'T WANT TO TAKE A DISEASE BY DISEASE APPROACH AND THAT IS SOMETHING BOTH AS I SAID THE HEALTH PLANS. AND THE DELTA OF THE SUPPORTERS IS SPELLED PEOPLE CONTENT THIS COMMUNITY DON'T WANT AS WELL. BECAUSE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS WE SHOULD COME OF THE POLICY THAT APPLIES. ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ANYONE WHO'S IN THAT TYPE OF SITUATION SO WITH THAT AGAIN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE BILL- I HOPE THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US THAT TO ALSO IN ADDITION TO DEBATING THE BILL TO TRY TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. AND WITH THAT- I GUESS I WILL NOT BE ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE BECAUSE THERE'S NO VOTE BUT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- WITNESSES. WITNESSES TO BE ABLE. TO TESTIFY AS WELL ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DO HAVE. WITNESSES IN SOME- AND- PLEASE- WE HAVE THE OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IN A LETTER OPENER. PLEASE GO AHEAD. I'LL GO AHEAD AND START SO- AFTERNOON THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY COMMENTS- MY NAME'S KANTOR WE CAN SHARE THE PARTNERSHIP TO FIGHT CHRONIC DISEASE. APPIA CD. A MAJOR FOCUS OF PFPT ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO ACCESS FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS IN THOSE AT RISK. BUT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT DOES IT REMEDY IS A MAJOR PROBLEM OTHER PEOPLE HAVE LIVING WITH ONE OR MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. BOB NEEDING HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES BEFORE GETTING COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH. BUT AS YOU JUST HEARD THAT MORE CENTER PAN TALK ABOUT- THE HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES. THE REALITY ISN'T IN CALIFORNIA- THE AVERAGE DEDUCTIBLES ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER INDIVIDUAL FOR TWENTY FOUR EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER FAMILY. AS A HYPER TO THE PEOPLE LIVING WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS FACE EACH YEAR. I WE KNOW FROM ECONOMIC STUDIES THAT HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS MEDICATIONS NEGATIVELY AFFECT MEDICATION ADHERENCE. SUPPORT HERE PLEASE WHO AFFORDABLE COMPLICATIONS. INCREASE THE OUR VISITS HOSPITALIZATIONS DISEASE PROGRESSION THE PREACHER THE DISABILITY AND THAT THAT'LL COST MONEY. EXACTLY CURRICULA BUDGET OFFICE ROUTINELY AT THE YOU INCREASE OUR COPAYS BY A DOLLAR WE'RE NOT RICH PERSON IT INCREASES NON MEDICATION COSTS BY 25% I ADDITIONAL STUDY SHOWED THAT PATIENTS WITH POOR MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS IF YOU INCREASE WHAT THEY PAY OUT OF POCKET BY A DOLLAR FOR DRUGS. IT INCREASES TOTAL SPENDING BY A DOLLAR EIGHTY THAT ACTUALLY INCREASES TOTAL COSTS SO THOSE OFFSET YOUR CRITICAL AND REALLY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY MOVING IN A VERY SIMILAR DIRECTION- THEY'RE ALLOWING MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS TO ELIMINATE COST SHARING BUT NOT ONLY JUST THE DOCTOR BILLS WHICH CARRIED HIM THIS BILL IS JUST FOCUS ON. BUT ALSO COPAYS- IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS TO KEEP THE MOTHER HOSPITAL'S EMERGENCY ROOMS AND CLINICS AND SO THE BIG PLANS- IN IN THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PROGRAM- THE HUMANA'S AND- AT THE END SO ONE OUR- ARE BASICALLY ELIMINATING COST SHARING. UP FOR CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THE COST HEARING- BURKE CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS. REALLY DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE TAKING THEIR MEDICATIONS KEEPING THEM HEALTHY. AND KEEPING THEM OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. SO THIS ISSUE OF MEDICATION ADHERENCE IS SORT OF A CENTERPIECE TO WHAT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS TRYING TO. GET OUT INCREASING OF MEDICATION ADHERENCE. WE KNOW. OVER THE OVER THE LONG HAUL STATES MONEY USE PATIENTS HEALTHIER. AND KEEPS THEM FROM ADDITIONAL. ARTICLE CARE THAT WE CAN PREVENT THIS SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE PASSAGE OF SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY EIGHT. AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE REASONS FOR THE SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO OUR OUR NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT- WHO'S IN THE GALLERY PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WIDE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SURE LET'S TAKE FROM PHARMA FOR THE RECORD. SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT ELIMINATES THE DEDUCTIBLE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS AS IDENTIFIED BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. IN CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CAN FACE A DEDUCTIBLE UP TO SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT EVEN A BILL OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A NEW PRESCRIPTION DRUG WILL LEAD PATIENTS TO ABANDON THAT PRESCRIPTION AT THE PHARMACY COUNTER. 45% OF THE TIME. THIS IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC WHEN A PATIENT IS NEW TO THEIR PRESCRIPTION BECAUSE INSTEAD OF TREATING THE CHRONIC DISEASE EARLY ON WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT DISEASE TO MANIFEST IN THAT CAN COST THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. MORE OVER TIME. THIS BILL WOULD HELP ADDRESS THAT BARRIER TO MAKE SURE PATIENTS GOT ACCESS TO THAT MEDICATION FROM THE BEGINNING OF THEIR DIAGNOSIS. THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS ESTIMATED BY TROOPER TO SAVE CALIFORNIANS A HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR WHILE ONLY INCREASING COST OF PLANS BY POINT 12% WE APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ASKED FOR AMENDMENTS TO LIMIT THIS BILL- AND CONTROL FOR THE FISCAL IMPACT PHARMA- RELUCTANTLY HAS AGREED TO LIMIT THIS BY- ONLY INCLUDING THE GROUP MARKET PLACE AND EXCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE. IN DOING THAT WE KNOW IN THE TO BERMAN ALICE'S UNFORTUNATELY THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET PLACE IS THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE BENEFITED THE MOST SO WE WOULD WANT TO SEE A STUDY DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK AT HOW ADHERENCE IS IMPACTED BY THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG DEDUCTIBLE. WE ALSO ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH A FIVE YEAR SUNSET ON THE BILL THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES ON THE PHONE. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. NIKOLAY THOSE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS BUT REGRETTABLY TAKING OPPOSE POSITION ON SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT. BUT WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS THE WRONG SOLUTION FOR THE GROWING PROBLEM OF DRUG PRICING- BY WAY OF BACKGROUND. THE DRUGS USED TO TREAT CHRONIC CONDITIONS COMMONLY FALL INTO THE SPECIALTY DRUG DEFINITION AND MEANING THEY ARE USED TO TREAT COMPLEX CONDITIONS AND ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. THESE ARE OFTEN LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS RELY ON DAILY. AND SADLY JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE HIGH PRICE DRUG CRISIS WE DO NOT ADDRESS THIS CRISIS WILL CONTINUE TO BURDEN OUR HEALTH SYSTEM AND PUT PATIENTS AT RISK. HEALTH PLANS ARE DOING THEIR PART TO PROVIDE VALUE IN ACCESS TO MINERAL IS BY COVERING 97% OF THE COST OF SPECIALTY DRUGS. AND THAT IS AN. INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. NO THERE ISN'T. DRUG PRICE PROBLEM BECAUSE WHAT SPECIALTY DRUGS ACCOUNT FOR ONE POINT 5% OF ALL THE PRESCRIPTIONS. THEY COMPRISE NEARLY FIFTY SIX POINT 1% OF ANNUAL SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. IN RECOGNITION OF THIS OVERALL DRUG PRICING PROBLEM THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THIS PHENOMENON HEALTH PLANS THAT SUPPORTED COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS. AND IT'S INCLUDES GREATER TRANSPARENCY LAWS IN THE FORM OF S. B. SEVENTEEN- FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND DESPITE LEGAL CHALLENGES ARE FROM THE MANUFACTURERS AND SOME COMPLIANCE ISSUES. SB SEVENTEEN WE STILL BELIEVE IT'S GROUND BREAKING LAW WHICH IS PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL OF VALUE TO THE DEBATE OVER HIGH PRICE DRUGS- WE ALSO APPLY VIA THIRD EFFORTS OF THE AUTHOR FROM LAST YEAR. I'M IN THE FORM OF SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO WHICH WAS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF MORE GENERIC DRUGS WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASING COMPETITION. THUS LOWERING PRICES. THOSE ARE SENSIBLE SOLUTIONS ONE DECADE AT THE ROOT PROBLEM BOB REGRETTABLY FIVE SIXTY TAKES THE OPPOSITE APPROACH AND WILL NUMBER ONE INCREASE PREMIUMS ON INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES EMPLOYERS IN YOUR DISTRICTS. INDEED THIS IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE HERE MANDY BILL THAT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED THIS YEAR- AND THIS IS BECAUSE WHILE YOU'RE REGULATING THE BENEFIT DESIGN THE DRUG COMPANIES ARE STILL FREE TO PRICE OUR PRODUCTS WHERE THEY WANT. AND THIS WOULD BE AN UNFORTUNATE OUTCOME AS WE HAVE SEEN A REMARKABLY LOW PREMIUM INCREASES ARE PARTICULARLY UP THE COVER CALIFORNIA LEVEL OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. SO BILLS LIKE FIVE SIXTY COULD ALSO FOR OUR PLAN PRODUCTS OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE RULES AROUND BENEFIT DESIGN. AND DOES REQUIRE UP PLANS TO INCREASE OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR OTHER SERVICES- AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A FAIR OUTCOME EITHER- IT IS SECOND OUTCOME DOES COME TO PASS A SPONSORS OF SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT OR BILLS LIKE IT- CUMULATIVELY- THEY SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TELL POLICYMAKERS WHICH SERVICES WOULD SEE AN- INCREASE IN OUT OF POCKET COSTS. TO BE START THE POLICIES ARE IMPLEMENTED- SO ELIMINATING THE DEDUCTIBLE DOES NOTHING TO HELP THE LARGER PROBLEM BY JUST REQUIRES COSTS TO BE MADE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE BENEFIT DESIGN. AND SO- YOU KNOW WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE HE TENDS TO LIMIT THE BILL- BUT THEY DON'T ADDRESS THE UNDER. LYING FLAWS WITH THE APPROACH OF SB. FIVE SIXTY EIGHT AND THOSE ARE THE REASONS THAT WE OPPOSE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY. AND WE HAVE AN- WITNESS OFFICE. WHENEVER YOU'RE- YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT. WELL THE BILL IS CERTAINLY WELL INTENTIONED AND UNFORTUNATELY WILL HAVE LARGE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OUR PRIMARY CONCERN WITH SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT OR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANDATE THE STATE PHARMACEUTICAL EQUIPMENT SUPPLY PRICES REMAINING UNAFFECTED. WHICH BERMAN HOUSES WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES NOW INDICATE THAT SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT WOULD INCREASE PREMIUMS ON EMPLOYERS BY OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS EMPLOYEES BY NEARLY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CRE FOUNDATION FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TWO PREMIUMS FOR THE AVERAGE FAMILY HEALTH PLAN AND THE EMPLOYER MARKET HAVE INCREASED A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE PERCENT. BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION OF POOR HEALTH BENEFITS SURVEY INDICATED THAT THE JOB BASED COVERAGE THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PREMIUM FOR FAMILY COVERAGE FIVE SIXTY OR DATABASES COST. TREND ENACTED THE HEALTHCARE COSTS RIGHT. YOUR TO THE- AMOUNT MENTION THE AND NOW. WITH APPRECIATE THE- COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF CONSIDERATION. THEY DO UNFORTUNATELY NOT- LACK- ME BILITY TO ASSUAGE YOUR CONCERNS AT THIS TIME SO IN CLOSING WHILE SB FIVE SIXTY ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WE NEED TO REMAIN COGNIZANT OF THE IMPACT THAT THESE MANDATE HAVE. A DRIVING HEALTH CARE COSTS UPWARDS SO FOR THESE REASONS PROPOSED SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT THANK YOU.

WHICH IS USUALLY SO YEAH. IF YOU HAD A QUESTION YOU YOU TALK ABOUT THE COST SAVINGS EARLIER DURING YOUR TESTIMONY. UNDERSKIRT YOU KNOW WHAT THE COST SAVINGS WOULD BE FOR THE STATE OR MAYBE THE PLANS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION A SHORT LISTED FOR THE RECORD- IF YOU LOOK A THE STATE SPECIFIC COSTS. SURE BURKE- LOOKED AT THAT AND SAID THAT CALPERS WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED BECAUSE STATE EMPLOYEES ALREADY BENEFIT FROM A ZERO DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE FOR PATIENTS- MATIC MEDIKAL WOULD ALSO NOT BE IMPACTED. AND WITH OUR AMENDMENTS THAT- EXCHANGE COVERED CALIFORNIA WOULD BE EXCLUDED SO THE COST TO THE STATE WOULD BE MINIMAL IT WOULD JUST BE DMH. AND DELIGHTS- ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE TO FOR I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT THE END OF THIS BILL HAS BEEN INTERESTING AS WE ALL KNOW AND- I RESPECT- DOCTOR PAN AND YOUR EFFORTS AND I WAS IN THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I AM CURIOUS OR- IS. AS THIS BILL I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO BE DISCUSSED. AND ARE WE GOING TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY- IS BUILT ON ICE AND I GUESS CAN'T WE'RE WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE A VOTE ON IT TODAY. GREAT BUT ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT AT SOME POINT IS THIS WE CAN MAKE THIS TO YOUR BILL IS KIND ONE WHERE IS THE COMMITTEE AT WITH THIS PARTICULAR BECAUSE I DO THINK FOR. A LOT OF REASONSOF MY CONSTITUENCIES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- THAT I. DECIDE IS WHAT I AM CURIOUS BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF MOVING PARTS WITH THIS BILL VERY VERY QUICKLY. AND I AM JUST YEARS WE GET SOME CLARIFICATION ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF WHERE THIS BILLS AT SO. WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER THAT- YOU KNOW. LOOK I'M I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. ON THIS WE HAVE A- WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT. THE SCOPE OF AND THE BREADTH OF THIS BILL- AND- IF. IF WE CAN AGREE ON SOME GUARD RAILS IN THE FUTURE- I'M HAPPY. HAPPY TO DO THAT. THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR OF A TWO YEAR SESSION- THIS THIS. DOES NOT NECESSARILY DEAD. AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THIS- WE HAVE A VERY. BIG BIG CHASM HERE VERY VERY BIG DIFFERENCE HERE- AND SO. I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH HIM IF HE IF HE IF HE CHOOSES TO DO THAT. AND I OBVIOUSLY HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR BOTH OF THE CHAIRS OF THIS AND I THINK THAT- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT- THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES AND I HAVE ABSOLUTE FAITH THAT WE CAN WORK THIS OUT I LOOK FORWARD TO SOME POINT BEING ABLE TO VOTE ON THE BILL. THANK YOU. GIVE ANYONE ELSE. DAN SEEING THAT NO ONE WOULD YOU I DO HAVE SOME IDEA OF COMMENT IN A COUPLE COMMENTS YOU KNOW WELCOME WHILE THIS BILL IN D. DOES SEEM INCREASE- PATIENT ACCESS. TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE PRO THE APPROACH OF TWO FIRST DOLLAR FOR ALL CHRONIC DISEASES I REMEMBER THE CHRONIC DISEASES SIGN IS DEFINED AS SOMETHING THAT LASTS MORE THAN A YEAR. SO THAT'S A LOT OF DISEASES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALSO FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEDICATIONS AS WELL. I'M CONCERNED WITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK. AT THE RISING COSTS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND ITS IMPACT ON. HEALTHCARE COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY YOU KNOW I HAVE A STRONG INTEREST IN PORTABILITY- AND- I JUST I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS POTENTIALLY- WITHOUT. REALLY LOOKING AT THE COST OF DRUGS- IS A ATTENTION A MASSIVE INCREASE IN THE COST OF HEALTHCARE SO- WE DISAGREE OBVIOUSLY ON THIS- WHERE WE ARE AS OF RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S A LOSER- I WANT TO. THEIR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A PATHWAY HERE- THE FIVE MOST COMMON FOR MOST COMMON DISEASES. POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. SO SO I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE YOU KNOW IF YOU LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING- RIGHT DOWN TODAY WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE A VOTE ON THE BILL AND- GIVE YOU HAVE A CHANGE OF CLOTHES. OKAY THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR WOULD AND- I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK YOU KNOW BOTH OF US I THINK WE SHOULD REMAIN THE SAME THINGS IN FACT I AM PROUD TO HAVE- WORK WITH YOU TO GET YOUR BILL OUT ON GENERIC MEDICATIONS- THAT- THAT THAT YOU WORKED SO HARD ON APPRECIATE YOUR ADVOCACY- YEAH I MYSELF OF AUTHORED- BILLS AS WELL APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON THOSE SO I THINK WE BOTH. SHARE THE CONCERN ABOUT PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS WE BOTH SHARE A CONCERN ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AS WELL AND AGAIN I THINK WE SUPPORTED EACH OTHER IN IN THAT EFFORT- I THINK WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND I BEGAN I VERY MUCH WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. I THINK THIS. IS A POINTED OUT TO THE- TRYING TO PICK WHICH DOES. ALL RIGHTS OF THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN LIMIT BACK THAT'S WHY IN FACT I WAS- LORD WILLING TO ACCEPT EVEN THOUGH. YOU KNOW SOME SPONSOR SAID RELUCTANTLY BUT I WAS WILLING TO SAY OKAY LET'S DO THE GROUP MARKET BECAUSE AFTER ALL AS I POINTED OUT. INDIVIDUAL MARKET. EVEN THOSE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLANS YOU HAVE A CHOICE ANOTHER PLAN RIGHT YOU COULD YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY THE BROWN'S THANK YOU DESERVE IT AND WE SHOULD DO IN EDUCATION- EFFORT. WITH THEM RIGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHOICES. THE CHALLENGES OF YOUR GROUP PLAN AND YOU HAVE A CHOICE THEN THEN YOUR STOCK RIGHT. IN FACT ACTUALLY MOST GROUP PLANS ACTUALLY DON'T PROVIDE ADOPTABLE EFFECT YOU JUST HEARD CALPERS DOESN'T BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE- IT'S- THAT IT'S NOT A REALLY EFFECTIVE WAY TO CONTROL PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION STATEMENT ABOUT. YELP REDUCING FARMERS NO COST. BUT AGAIN. THE DEDUCTIBLE AND AGAIN WE DON'T LIMIT TE COPAY THE DEDUCTIBLE ITSELF I REALLY A BARRIER TO PEOPLE AGAIN WITH CHRONIC DISEASES. IN TERMS OF GETTING MOVED FORWARD. SO I'M VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT WE CAN TRY TO TALK ABOUT MAYBE VALUE AND SO FORTH BUT I. I DO THINK IT'S CHALLENGING TO SAY. I HAVE TO TAKE IT JUST FROM A GROUP OF DISEASES- BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE WITH RARE CONDITIONS WHO DEFINITELY STILL NEEDED TO HAVE THEIR FACING THE SAME PROBLEM. AS SOMEONE LET'S SAY WITH DIABETES OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH MORE COMMON. AND SO. I YOU KNOW AND AGAIN I SAID THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE TOLD ME THEY DON'T DO THE DISEASE BY THESE APPROACH EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THE SPONSORS DON'T WANT TO DO IT THAT WAY. I'M NOT SURE IT'S GOOD POLICY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN DISEASE. YOU'RE OKAY WE DON'T THAT'S NOT IT WE'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF DETECTABLE BUT YOU HAVE THAT OTHER DISEASE WHICH ALSO HAS THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS DOES CRIME THIS CITY AND IT'S NEAT. YOUR NEED TO CONTINUE. SO PERHAPS AGAIN I LOOK FOR TO DIALOGUE YOU KNOW MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT VALUE LIKE OKAY IS THE DRUG HOW HELPFUL IS THE DRUG TO PREVENT YOU FROM. ENDING UP IN THE HOSPITAL E. ARE. ALL RIGHT AND I THINK THERE'S OTHER EFFORTS THAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER WHICH I KNOW WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THE OVERALL COST OF THE DRUG. RIGHT TO TRY TO BRING THAT DOWN- DIFFERENT TYPES OF POLICIES- BUT- I DO THINK THAT AND I HOPE WHAT I LOOK FOR TO AN ONGOING DIALOGUE. THAT TRYING TO PICK. WHICH DISEASE AND I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM IN TERMS OF SAYING WELL THAT'S ONE WAY TO NARROW DRUG BUT I THINK I THINK THAT. THAT CREATES A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF WHY THIS DISEASE VERSES THAT IS IT MORE BECAUSE IT'S MORE COMMON THERE FOR YOUR TICKET. YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT THIS HE'S LIKE SICKLE CELL THE MAINLY AFFECTS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION AND. WE MENTIONED EACH OF YOU WILL HAVE THE OF CANCER. OTHER YOUNG VICE GIVE A RARE. NEAR LA. THE WHY IS IT SO NOW. FOR YOU. PURSES A LOT NOW YOU SAY THE DRUG ITSELF IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE OR DOESN'T HAVE IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF CONVERSATION BUT I THINK IF IT'S IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA KEEP YOU HEALTHY. WHY DO WE PUT YOU KNOW AND TO KEEP YOU OUT OF HOSPITAL AND- ALLOW YOU TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A REASONABLE QUALITY OF LIFE WE CAN GET YOU TO GO TO WORK AND HAVE THESE VALLEY. THEN THE QUESTION IS WHY DO WE WANT HIGHER DEDUCTIBLE. AS A SORT OF THIS ROAD BOND TO YOU BE ABLE TO GET THE MEDICATION AGAIN WE DON'T ELIMINATE COPAYS. SO I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK I LOOK FOR CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD I KNOW YOU'RE YOU YOU AND YOUR CAT CAN YOU STAFF BRING A LOT OF EXPERTISE AS WELL. AND WE WON'T HAVE THAT DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO THE MOVE- THE- YOUNG. AFFECTED POLICY FOR SO THAT WE CAN BE SURE PEOPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND LIKE YOU SAID YOU AND I THINK AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON AFFORDABILITY. WE WANT PEOPLE HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO NOT ONLY LEAD. DEL GOOD LIVES BUT ALSO. THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY AS WELL IN A POSITIVE WAY SO WITH THAT. AGAIN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT I HOPE. I LOOK FORWARD TO AN OPPORTUNITY PERHAPS THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN TAKE A VOTE THE SPOKEN BEFORE AND I CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS THE HOPEFULLY MAYBE WE CAN COME TO SOME AGREEMENT SOMEWHERE. TO FIT THE BILL IN THE- IN IN THE RIGHT FRAME SO WE CAN. TRY TO MOVE THIS POLICY FORWARD. SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TALKED HIM. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM OUR NEXT PRESENTER. SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HERE IN PRESENTING SB SIX FIFTY TWO ALL TODAY. THIS IS THE CORPORATE TRANSPARENCY IN ELDER CARE ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND LOOK AT THE END OF LIFE WHICH OFTEN WE DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IN IN OUR LINE OF WORK BUT WE ALL TO GET OLD. AND SOMEOF OUR MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS HER PARENTS OR LOVED. MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY- SAYS TRUE IN MY FAMILY I'M SURE IS TRUE IN MANY OF YOURS. END UP LIVING IN NURSING HOMES AND THE NATURE OF THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE WAY WE STRUCTURED IT- THE BULK OF THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. BY FOR PROFIT COMPANIES. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE DISCOVERED THROUGH BOTH INVESTIGATIVE INVESTIGATIONS FROM JOURNALISTS AND I'M SOME PUBLIC AUDITS HOW SOME OF THE FOR PROFIT NURSING HOMES ARE USING COMPLEX OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES. TO SAFE AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNTS OF FUNDING TO RELATED PARTIES. TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN- CORPORATE ENTITIES ALLOWING CORPORATE HOME OFFICES TO HIDE THEIR PROFITS IN SUPPORT FACILITIES CLAIMS FOR YET MORE PUBLIC MONEY WHEN INVESTING- OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN MEDICARE SYSTEM THIS YEAR. AND MUCH OF THAT WILL BE FUNDING OUR ELDER CARE AND OUR CARICOM TO ME BUT- THIS BILL IS REALLY INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THAT MONEY IS GOING WHERE WE SAY IT'S GOING. ALLEN THAT IT'S REACHING PEOPLE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. WHETHER IT'S THE CARE WORKERS PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE WE LOVE. OR THE PEOPLE WE LOVE THEMSELVES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT GETTING SHORT SHRIFT. OR SOMEHOW A LANGUISHING. WITHOUT A PROPER RESOURCES WELL- THE FOLKS WHO OWN THE CORPORATIONS ARE RUNNING OFF WITH. WITH PROFITS THANKS TO TRICKY ACCOUNTING TECHNIQUES- WE THINK THAT. THIS BILL WILL HOPEFULLY PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY- THROUGH THE REVIEW AND AUDIT PROVISIONS IN THE LEGISLATION NOW AND I WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHAIR AND THEIR STAFF. AS WELL AS- THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE HEALTH WHO WAS JUST HERE PRESENTING WITH YOU FOR THEIR- THEIR STAFF ASSISTANCE AND FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE- AS WELL AS THE- ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES FOR THEIR PATIENTS IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS. I WANT TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS NOTED ON PAGES NINE AND TEN. AT TO REQUIRE THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL GROUP THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PORTS TO BE REVIEWED BY A CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT. LET'S THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES COMPLETING AN AUTO COMPLETING AN AUDIT ALREADY. FOR ANY REASON IN WHICH CASE- THEY'LL BE DOING MORE THAN JUST A REVIEW- AND JUST TO REMIND YOU THAT ALL THESE REVIEWS WOULD BE. PUBLIC THE CORPORATE OWNERSHIP STRUCTUR WILL ALSO BE DISCLOSED ASHTEAD AND WE'RE IN CONSULTATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW W HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED WITH THE- WITH THE DIRECTOR WE KNOW THEY'VE GOT A LOT ON THEIR PLATE AND IN FACT THEY'RE- THEY'RE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THE PROFIT AND LOSS STATEMENT. PURSUANT TO A IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION FROM THE CHAIR- BUT WE THINK THIS IS LEGISLATION CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT. I EVEN WHILE THAT WORK IS WITH IS UNDER WAY WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL YIELD SOME IMPORTANT DATA- THE KIND OF FINANCIAL DATA THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE ABOUT THE NATURE OF RELATED PARTIES- COMES AT A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT. AND NEW REVELATIONS ABOUT- SOMEBODY'S CORPORATE STRUCTURES AND WAITING ANOTHER FEW YEARS TO GET THIS INFORMATION COULD RESULT IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH THE BE- OF LOSSES- TO TAXPAYERS- TO. TO THOSE WHO WE CARE FOR AND TO THOSE WHO CARE FOR THEM. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THIS YEAR YOU CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM AS WELL AS A. R. P. FOR THEIR SUPPORT- AND I THINK WE HAVE- SOME RELIEF WITNESSES ON THE LINE RIGHT NOW. BOTH THE CANNER AN SEIU A TO TESTIFY OVER THE PHONE.

SB SIX FIFTY IS A BIG PIECE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE PROTECT PLAN A PACKAGE OF BILLS AIMING TO REPAIR BREAKDOWNS. IN LONG TERM CARE- EXPOSED BY THE PANDEMIC IN CHURCH TO TRY TO PROTECT THE CITY RESIDENTS FROM. FROM HARMONY WILL BY POOR PUBLIC POLICY. SB SIX FIFTY ADDRESSES. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INVESTING NURSING HOME. THIS IS TO THEMSELVES. THE MONEY MOVED TO RELATED PARTIES IS DIVERTED FROM RESIDENT CARE. HIDING PROFITS ENABLE THE INDUSTRY TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE EVERY FEW YEARS SIMPLY PERSONALLY ASK FOR MORE MONEY. INDUSTRY CAPITALIZES ON AN ASYMMETRY OF INFORMATION THE NURSING HOMES NO THEIR COSTS IMPROPER IN THE STATE DOESN'T. THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY RESULT IN THE STATE BEING RIPPED OFF THANK FOR PRIVATE JETS IN VACATION HOMES FOR NURSING HOMEOWNERS INSTEAD OF FOR THE STAFF AND RESOURCES CRITICAL TO RESIDENT WELL BEING. OUR REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM LACKS MEANINGFUL DISCLOSURE OF NURSING HOME EXPENDITURES AND THIS ENABLES GREED AND DECEPTION. SB SIX FIFTY REQUIRES NURSING HOMES TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RELATED PARTY FINANCES MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO HIDE THEIR PROFITS WHILE GIVING CALIFORNIA MORE CONTROL TO SUPPORT RESIDENT CARE. OUR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS ARE ISOLATED FRUSTRATED ANGRY EVEN KNOWS WHO DIED THEY DESPERATELY NEED A MORE TRANSPARENT AND SENSIBLE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM. PLEASE VOTE YES SEVEN SIX FIFTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE ONTO OUR NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT.

I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU MISTER CHAIR IN YOUR STAFF BUT THE MANY CONVERSATIONS BUDGET CONCERNS TO THE BILL AND ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ANY UNDERSTOOD SURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND NURSING HOME. THE COSBY NINETEEN PANDEMIC AT THIS AGE HAVE EXPOSED LONGSTANDING ARSENAL PRACTICES THAT HAVE CREATED AN ANIMATED QUOTABLE PROFIT DRIVEN INDUSTRY SACRIFICES THE SAFETY-AND LIVELIHOOD OF WORKER AND THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR RESIDENTS. CHRONIC UNDERSTAFFING LACK OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND LOOPHOLES IN THE SYSTEM APALUTAMIDE AMERICAN HOME INDUSTRY WHICH IS WHY WE ARE SEEKING IMPLEMENT REFORMS THAT WILL MOVE OUR STATE NURSING HOMES GET THEM TOWARDS ONE MEDICAL QUALITY CARE CORPORATE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I THINK THE FIFTY AND TO BRING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO BILLIONAIRE NURSING HOME OWNERS WHO HAVE CALLED RICHARD BY PROFITING FROM MY NETWORK INTERNALLY TO CORPORATIONS THAT EXTRACT PROFIT AT EVERY LEVEL RATHER. THAN INVESTING IN PATIENT CARE. TWENTY SEVEN KINDER NEWS. FOUND THAT NURSING THE BILL WHICH CONTRACT RELATED PARTY ACTING KNOWS THE EIGHT PAGE. THEY HAVE RATES OF PATIENT INJURY AND PRACTICE THANK AND THEIR THE SUBJECT OF COMPLAIN ALMOST AS OFTEN AS A- HOME. FACILITY OWNER HAVE USED. OWNERSHIP TO OUR THE SHIP OPERATION CONTROL. LIMIT ME EXPERTS AND CRY. TO THE LADY OVER. BETTING LIKE. ACCORDING TO ASK BETTER TWENTY NINETEEN THERE WAS OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS BUT- AND SELF REPORTED RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND ABOUT 99% OF THE PORT RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WILL REIMBURSABLE. I THINK THAT FIFTY IS ABOUT ENSURING QUALITY RESIDENT CARE BY PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY I NEED TO CANCEL THE INDUSTRY FROM FROM PROFIT CENTERS TO TRUE CARE CENTERS. OUR MEMBERS KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT IT'S LIKE pTO NOT KNOW WHO THE OWNER IS NORMALLY. GOING BUT WHAT THEY DO KNOW IS THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO WORKERS AND RESIDENTS. DOUBLE FORMS OF SB FIFTY FIFTY WILL BRING MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY TO THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY AND SHOW THAT PUBLIC FUNDING FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE. ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED FOR RESIDENTS AND TO AND TO PROTECT THE LOWEST POINT TO OTHER THAN PRACTICE. AND PRACTICAL THE NINETEEN- NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AND WORKERS HAD MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE ISSUES THAT ARE ROOTED IN THE INDUSTRY CAN NO LONGER BE IGNORED. OUR STATE IS IN DIRE NEED OF TRANSFORMING NURSING HOMES NOT NURSING HOMES FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY APPARENTLY THE VULNERABLE CALIFORNIA'S AND THE WORKERS WHO DEDICATE THEIR LIVES.

HI MY NAME IS DR STEVE SHOPTALK I AM- NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED SCIENTIST AND CLINICIAN- I DEVELOP EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS FOR ADDICTION PARTICULAR TREATMENT FOR STIMULANT USE DISORDER BOTH COCAINE AND METHAMPHETAMINE. MUCH OF THE WORK ON CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT'S BEEN DONE BY CALIFORNIA SCIENTISTS AND CLINICIANS WITH THE SPECIALLY MEANINGFUL THAT SENATOR WARREN WIENER AND COLLEAGUES. ARE COMMITTED TO BRINGING THIS POTENTIAL TREATMENT TO CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH ADDICTION TO STIMULANTS. BUT CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT IS IT THE PROSPERITY DEVELOPMENT THIRTY YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. IT PROVIDES INCENTIVES THAT INCREASE IN VALUE IN EXCHANGE FOR BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES EITHER URINE OR SALIVA TO DOCUMENT DRUG ABSTINENCE. THE INCENTIVES INCREASE EACH TIME PATIENTS PROVIDE CONSECUTIVE SCHEDULED SAMPLES THAT TEST NEGATIVE FOR STIMULANTS. THE KEY ADVANTAGE OF THIS THERAPY IS ITS RESPECT FOR PEOPLE IT WORKS BY SIMPLY LETTING POPLE TAILOR THEIR LIVES SO THAT ENGAGE FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS. DOING THINGS OTHER THAN USING STIMULANTS LIKE METHAMPHETAMINE WHICH ESSENTIALLY CREATES INDIVIDUALLY TAILORED TREATMENTS TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING STIMULANT FREE SAMPLES AND A DRUG FREE LIFE. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TWENTY MANAGE IT IS THE MOST POWERFUL TREATMENT FOR STIMULANT USE DISORDER FULL STOP. IT IS A FAR STRONGER THERAPY AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY- MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING APPROACHES COMMONLY DELIVERING GOOD TREATMENT PROGRAM.

REAL SALT SHOW THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE THERAPY DUE TO BRING CHANGES WHEN DELIVERING CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT. IT'S NOT A MAGIC BULLET WITH THE STATE WELL IT'S A POWERFUL THERAPY LIKE ALL MEDICATIONS IT DOES NOT WORK IF IT'S NOT TAKEN.
