EMERGENCY REQUEST IN THE FALL

00:44:59.129 --> 00:45:00.998
OF TWENTY TWENTY IN SEPTEMBER.

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:02.399
WE COMBINE THAT WITH OUR HIGH

00:45:02.466 --> 00:45:04.134
RISK AUTHORITY TO GIVE US THE

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:06.670
ABILITY TO CONDUCT. A VARIETY

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:08.105
OF DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES- AND

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:10.407
LOOKING AT EDT. SO THREE KEY

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:11.575
AREAS I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:13.177
THE FIRST IS THEIR ABILITY TO

00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:15.312
PROCESS CLAIMS. THE SECOND IS

00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:16.713
RELATED TO THEIR CALL CENTER

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.148
AND THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:19.783
SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.785
OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE THIRD

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:22.686
AREAS LOOKING AT FRAUD

00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:24.588
PREVENTION AND DETECTION WHAT

00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:26.790
THEIR EFFORTS WERE WHAT TOOLS

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:28.125
THEY USE IT CENTER. SO THE

00:45:28.192 --> 00:45:29.426
FIRST ISSUE RELATED TO CLAIMS

00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:30.794
PROCESSING THIS HAS BEEN A

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.329
HISTORIC AS CENTER LAYERED

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:34.331
INDICATED. AFTER THE RECESSION

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:36.033
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.067
LEGISLATURE ASKED US THROUGH

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:38.035
THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT

00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:39.703
COMMITTEE. ASKED US TO CONDUCT

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.572
AN AUDIT OF EDT AND ITS ABILITY

00:45:41.638 --> 00:45:43.140
TO PROCESS CLAIMS PARTICULARLY

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:44.108
IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THERE

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:46.176
IS A RECESSION. UNEMPLOYMENT

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:47.878
INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY. WE

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:49.880
ISSUED A REPORT IN MARCH OF

00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:50.781
TWENTY ELEVEN AND FOUND THEY

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:53.050
HAD STRUGGLES IN. PROCESSING

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:54.518
CLAIMS THEY HAVEN'T ASSESSED

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:55.652
THEIR STAFFING THEIR CALL

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:57.321
CENTER WAS. PERFORMING VERY

00:45:57.387 --> 00:45:59.389
POORLY ANSWERED LESS THAN 10%

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:00.691
OF THE CALLS THAT GOT WORSE

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:02.259
DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT THEY

00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:03.827
REALLY STRUGGLE SO WE MADE A

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:05.129
VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:07.264
EDT TO IMPROVE. THEIR CALL

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:08.866
CENTER TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:10.834
THEIR STAFF TO AUTOMATE CERTAIN

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:12.102
ASPECTS OF THEIR CLAIMS

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:13.871
PROCESSING. WE CONDUCTED A

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:16.340
FOLLOW UP ON IT NOVEMBER OF

00:46:16.406 --> 00:46:16.907
TWENTY TWELVE UNFORTUNATELY

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:19.343
FOUND SOME OF THE SAME- ISSUES

00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:21.145
STILL HAPPENING. STRUGGLING

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:23.180
WITH PROCESSING CLAIMS THEY HAD

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:24.581
IMPROVE THEIR CALL CENTER SOME

00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:25.649
BUT THEY ACTUALLY LOST SOME

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:26.750
IMPORTANT FUNCTIONALITY AND

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:28.218
I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. WHEN I

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:29.586
TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE RELATED TO

00:46:29.653 --> 00:46:31.555
THE CALL CENTER. SO WE

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.524
CONDUCTED THIS AUDIT AGAIN ON.

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:34.358
AT THE DIRECTION OF THE

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:36.026
LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY UNDER

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:37.728
HIGH RISK IT ALREADY. AND FOUND

00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:39.229
AGAIN THEY WERE CONTINUING TO

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:40.931
STRUGGLE TO PROCESS CLAIMS AND

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:42.633
CERTAINLY IN THE PANDEMIC. ALL

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:44.067
OF THE ISSUES THAT EDT HAD

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:45.569
EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST WERE

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:47.437
EXACERBATED BECAUSE YOU YOU

00:46:47.504 --> 00:46:49.573
HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE. SEEKING

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.841
HELP SEEKING UNEMPLOYMENT

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:51.909
BENEFITS THROUGH THE EMPLOYMENT

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:53.744
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. SO WHEN

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:54.845
WE LOOK AT THEIR ABILITY TO

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:56.180
PROCESS CLAIMS WE FOUND THAT

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:58.282
CLOSE 250% OF THOSE CLAIMS.

00:46:58.348 --> 00:46:59.850
WERE GETTING KICKED OUT WHERE

00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:01.485
THEY HAVE TO MANUALLY DO SOME

00:47:01.552 --> 00:47:03.787
ANALYSIS AND DO SOME WORK WITH

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:04.922
STATE THE PARTICULAR

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:06.156
CONSTITUENT WHO IS TRYING TO

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:07.591
GET BENEFITS. AND THAT JUST

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:08.859
DIDN'T WORK IT WAS JUST TAKING

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:12.129
WAY TOO LONG. TO TRY TO PROVIDE

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:13.764
SERVICES TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS.

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.532
WHAT DO YOU DO EIGHTY DID DO.

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:17.234
AFTER AT THE RECOMMENDATION

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:18.602
BASED ON THE STRIKE TEAM AT THE

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.003
GOVERNOR PUT TOGETHER. WAS

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.105
USING ID ME SO THAT REALLY DID

00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:24.241
ASSIST IN HELPING. VERIFY

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:27.544
IDENTITIES OF INDIVIDUALS

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:28.145
BECAUSE THAT WAS A HUGE ISSUE.

00:47:28.212 --> 00:47:28.779
AS FAR AS THE- ABILITY PROCESS

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:29.780
CLAIMS SO THAT WAS AN

00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:31.248
IMPROVEMENT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:33.717
WHAT UP OTHER THINGS EDT DID IS

00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:35.686
THEY SUSPENDED CERTAIN THINGS-

00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:36.753
SUCH AS ELIGIBILITY

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.056
DETERMINATIONS. OTHER ISSUES

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:41.491
THAT TEST TO- QUICK AND GET

00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:42.960
THOSE CLAIMS PROCESS MORE

00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:44.695
QUICKLY EXPEDITE PROCESSING OF

00:47:44.761 --> 00:47:47.064
CLAIMS. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.533
THEY CAN NOT DO. LONG TERM

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.134
BECAUSE IF THEY WERE ABLE TO DO

00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:52.402
SOME OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE OF

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:54.137
THE PANDEMIC. THERE WERE SOME A

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.173
PANDEMIC PROGRAMS THAT CAME OUT

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:56.907
OF CONGRESS THAT WERE NEW

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:58.809
PROGRAMS. SUCH AS THE POOR

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:00.611
PROGRAM. PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT

00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:01.812
ASSISTANCE AND THIS IS FOR

00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:02.746
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SELF

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:04.581
EMPLOYED. SO THERE'S REALLY A

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:06.516
DIFFICULT ABILITY TO CONFIRM

00:48:06.583 --> 00:48:08.652
THEIR- THEIR INCOME THEIR

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:11.355
WAGES- SO EDT SAID WE'RE NOT

00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:12.422
GOING TO DO THAT LET'S JUST GO

00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:13.023
AHEAD AND GET SOME OF THOSE

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.758
CLAIMS PROCESS UNFORTUNATELY

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:16.660
SOME OF THOSE. ULTIMATELY ENDED

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:18.795
UP AS FRAUDULENT CLAIMS SO THE

00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:20.330
CLAIMS PROCESSING PRACTICES

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:22.733
WERE REALLY- THEY CONTINUE TO

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.968
STRUGGLE- AND CERTAINLY AS I

00:48:25.035 --> 00:48:27.804
SAID THE PANDEMIC EXACERBATED

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.906
THOSE PROBLEMS. NOW THE OTHER

00:48:29.973 --> 00:48:31.875
ISSUE THAT I JUST MENTIONED IS

00:48:31.942 --> 00:48:32.943
THEY DELAYED CERTAIN CRITICAL

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.779
WORK. TO TWO KEY THINGS

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:37.114
SUSPENDING ELIGIBILITY

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.382
REQUIREMENTS THIS IS A

00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:39.549
REQUIREMENT THAT AN INDIVIDUAL

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:41.051
HAS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:42.986
ARE ABLE AND AVAILABLE TO WORK.

00:48:43.053 --> 00:48:44.254
AND FOR ABOUT A TEN MONTH

00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:46.189
PERIOD BETWEEN MARCH AND

00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:47.858
DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THEY

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:49.359
SUSPENDED THOSE REQUIREMENTS

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:51.495
DIDN'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO PROVE

00:48:51.561 --> 00:48:53.764
THAT SO. NOW THEY HAVE WHEN WE

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.732
ISSUED THE REPORT. IT AFFECTED

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.067
ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION

00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:58.802
CLAIMANTS WILL CLOSE TO TWELVE

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:00.971
MILLION ISSUES- THE REASON WE

00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:02.439
IDENTIFIED THIS IS THE U. S.

00:49:02.506 --> 00:49:03.840
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR WHEN THEY

00:49:03.907 --> 00:49:05.442
BECAME AWARE THAT EDT HAD

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:07.210
SUSPENDED THIS REQUIREMENT.

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:08.979
TOLD THE STATE YOU CAN'T DO

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:10.514
THAT YOU'VE GOT TO REQUIRE

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.983
THESE FOLKS TO. DETERMINE YOU

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.384
KNOW SUBMIT THINGS TO SO THAT

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:16.019
YOU CAN DETERMINE THEY ARE

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:17.554
ELIGIBLE FOR THESE BENEFITS.

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:19.623
SIMILARLY THERE'S A PROCESS

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.957
WHERE SOMEONE HAS TO SUBMIT A

00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:23.026
BI WEEKLY CERTIFICATION EVERY

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:24.294
TWO WEEKS I AM SEEKING

00:49:24.361 --> 00:49:25.595
EMPLOYMENT I'M TRYING TO GET A

00:49:25.662 --> 00:49:28.298
JOB. EDT SUSPENDED THAT AS WELL

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:29.766
FOR ABOUT AN EIGHT WEEK EIGHT

00:49:29.833 --> 00:49:31.168
WEEK PERIOD BETWEEN MID MARCH

00:49:31.234 --> 00:49:33.770
OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND MAY OF

00:49:33.837 --> 00:49:35.839
TWENTY TWENTY AGAIN- THE U. S.

00:49:35.906 --> 00:49:36.606
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BECAME

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:38.642
AWARE OF THIS- HAD CONCERNS AND

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:39.776
INFORM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:41.878
YOU CANNOT DO THAT YOU'VE GOT

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:44.448
TO REINSTITUTE THOSE. SO THAT

00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:45.615
SITUATION THERE IS ABOUT ONE

00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:47.150
POINT SEVEN MILLION CLAIMANTS

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:49.853
AFFECTED BY THAT SO HUGE

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.021
DEFERRED WORKLOAD THAT WE TALK

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:52.789
ABOUT IN THE ART REPORT MISTER

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:54.057
HARRIS WILL TALK ABOUT. SOME OF

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:55.492
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO

WORKLOAD PLANNING HOW ARE YOU

00:49:56.827 --> 00:49:58.829
GOING TO ADDRESS YOUR ABILITY

00:49:58.895 --> 00:50:00.130
TO PROCESS CLAIMS AS THEY

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:02.799
CONTINUE TO COME IN. BUT NOW

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:03.767
DEAL WITH THIS DEFERRED

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:05.635
WORKLOAD THAT YOU HAVE SO YOU

00:50:05.702 --> 00:50:07.337
HAVE BASICALLY ACCUMULATED

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:08.872
BECAUSE YOU SUSPENDED THOSE

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:13.210
THOSE TWO KEY- CONTROLS KEY

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:14.311
PARTS OF YOUR PROGRAM. SO THOSE

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:15.145
ARE SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES

00:50:15.212 --> 00:50:16.713
RELATED TO PROCESSING YOU KNOW

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.315
ESTABLISH. IDENTIFYING WHAT

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:19.850
YOUR WORKLOAD IS THEY DEFERRED

00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:21.551
SOME THINGS NOW THEY HAVE THAT

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:23.587
WORKLOAD. SKEWS ME ON TOP OF

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:25.756
THEIR EXISTING WORKLOAD. THE

00:50:25.822 --> 00:50:27.424
CALL CENTER THE SECOND ISSUE

00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:28.091
THAT WE TALK ABOUT IN THE

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:30.594
REPORT. AS YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:32.329
YOUR CONSTITUENTS TRY TO CALL

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:33.930
EDT TO TRY TO GET ASSISTANCE

00:50:33.997 --> 00:50:35.565
CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH. WHEN

00:50:35.632 --> 00:50:37.567
THEY DO GET THROUGH THEY GET AN

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:39.102
INDIVIDUAL WHO PERHAPS HASN'T

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:40.804
WORKED FOR EDT VERY LONG CAN'T

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:42.873
ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS- THERE

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:44.307
WASN'T THE ABILITY FOR

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:46.176
CONSTITUENTS TO CALL IN AND

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:47.411
LEAVE A NUMBER SO THAT THEY

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:49.279
COULD BE CALLED BACK. THAT WAS

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:51.615
ONE OF THE- ASCENTIAL

00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:53.750
FUNCTIONALITY. THAT THEIR PRIOR

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:55.719
SYSTEM HAD THEIR NEW SYSTEM

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:56.620
HABIT BUT THEY HAVEN'T

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:57.654
IMPLEMENTED THEY HAVEN'T

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.122
ESTABLISHED IT. SO THERE WAS NO

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:00.824
CALL BACK OPTION THERE WERE NO

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.726
PRE RECORDED MESSAGES FOR

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:04.461
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAYBE JUST

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:06.163
WANTED. TO GET A QUESTION

00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:07.864
ANSWERED AND IT IF THERE WAS AN

00:51:07.931 --> 00:51:09.232
AUTOMATED SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:10.767
THEM TO GET THAT ANSWER. THEN

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:11.935
THEY WOULDN'T BE FRUSTRATED BY

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:13.503
BEING ON HOLD OR HAVING TO CALL

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.672
BACK OVER AND OVER AND OVER

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:16.640
AGAIN. TO TRY TO GET THROUGH

00:51:16.706 --> 00:51:19.843
TO. TO AN INDIVIDUAL- SO THIS

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.378
THIS PERFORMANCE EVEN IF IT WAS

00:51:21.445 --> 00:51:23.046
IT WAS POOR BEFORE THE PANDEMIC

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:25.081
IT JUST GOT. MISERABLE I MEAN

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.817
WAS LESS THAN 1% OF PEOPLE WERE

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:28.385
GETTING THROUGH TO SOMEONE AND

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:29.920
IMAGINE TRYING TO GET THROUGH

00:51:29.986 --> 00:51:30.754
AND THEN GETTING TO SOMEONE

00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:32.722
WHO. DOESN'T HAVE THE NECESSARY

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:34.391
TRAINING NO FAULT TO THEM THEY

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:35.892
THEY DID HIRE MORE PEOPLE BUT

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:36.827
THOSE PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE THE

00:51:36.893 --> 00:51:38.795
EXPERTISE. TO HELP FOLKS SO YOU

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:39.896
GET THROUGH AFTER CALLING

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:41.665
MULTIPLE TIMES. AND THEN YOU

00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:42.966
TALK TO SOMEONE WHO CAN'T HELP

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:44.801
YOU. VERY FRUSTRATING FOR

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:46.403
CONSTITUENTS. THE OTHER THING

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.172
IS WE IDENTIFIED THIS BACK IN

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:49.706
TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.842
ELEVEN. THEY WEREN'T ANALYZING

00:51:51.908 --> 00:51:53.844
ANY FIRST CALL RESOLUTION SO

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.779
WERE THEY RECORDING OKAY I

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:57.147
ANSWERED THE LINE HOUSE CALL

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:58.381
AND I WAS ABLE TO ANSWER HER

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:00.317
QUESTION. LET'S RECORD THAT SO

00:52:00.383 --> 00:52:01.551
THAT WE KNOW WHAT ARE THE TYPES

00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:03.019
OF QUESTIONS THAT CONSTITUENTS

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:04.287
ARE ASKING FOR THESE

00:52:04.354 --> 00:52:05.455
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED

00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:07.190
OR ASKING TO GET ASSISTANCE.

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:09.759
THAT WOULD IDENTIFY. WAYS TO

00:52:09.826 --> 00:52:11.161
TRAIN OUR STAFF OR THINGS YOU

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:12.429
COULD PUT ON THE WEBSITE AS A

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:14.030
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS SO

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:14.931
SOMEONE DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO

00:52:14.998 --> 00:52:16.500
CALL IN. SO THEY WEREN'T

00:52:16.566 --> 00:52:17.901
ASSESSING FIRST CALL RESOLUTION

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.736
THAT IS A BEST PRACTICE OUT

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:22.239
THERE IN THE INDUSTRY. THEY

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:22.939
WEREN'T TRACKING WHITE PEOPLE

00:52:23.006 --> 00:52:26.109
WERE CALLING- EDT. AND TRAINING

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:27.944
THEIR STAFF AND AGAIN AS I SAID

00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:30.680
UPDATING THAT FREQUENTLY ASKED

00:52:30.747 --> 00:52:32.315
QUESTIONS. SO WE HAD A LOT OF

00:52:32.382 --> 00:52:33.884
CONCERNS RELATED TO THE CALL

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.051
CENTER- WE MADE SOME

00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:36.786
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:38.455
CERTAINLY RELATED TO. USING THE

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.090
FUNCTIONALITY THAT THAT SYSTEM

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:41.758
HAS AS FAR AS ALLOWING FOR A

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:43.560
CALL BACK OPTION. PUTTING PRE

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:45.529
RECORDED MESSAGES OUT THERE SO

00:52:45.595 --> 00:52:46.963
THEY NEEDED TO DO A LOT OF

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.564
THINGS TO REALLY IMPROVE THAT

00:52:47.631 --> 00:52:49.866
CALL CENTER. THE LAST AREA

00:53:10.287 --> 00:53:11.688
CONSTITUENTS WERE RECEIVING

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:14.024
MULTIPLE MAILINGS AT THEIR HOME

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.025
FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T EVEN

DOCUMENTS WITH FULL SOCIAL

00:53:25.001 --> 00:53:28.738
SECURITY NUMBERS. WHY IS THE

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:29.906
A FOLLOW UP ON THAT AUDIT

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:31.541
NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TO

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:32.175
SEE IF THINGS HAD BEEN

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:34.077
CORRECTED THEY HAD NOT BEEN SO.

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:35.745
YOU HAVE A HUGE ISSUE OF

IDENTITY THEFT. AND IN FACT

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.883
WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDITS-

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:42.052
THAT WE ISSUED IN JANUARY. WE

00:53:42.118 --> 00:53:44.287
HAD IDENTIFIED ABOUT SEVENTY

00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:44.854
SEVEN THOUSAND CLAIMS THAT

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:46.456
INDIVIDUALS HAD SUBMITTED TO

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:48.391
EDT SAYING I THANK MY IDENTITY

00:53:48.458 --> 00:53:50.327
HAS BEEN STOLEN. COMPARE THAT

00:53:50.393 --> 00:53:52.062
TO CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:52.862
NINETEEN IT WAS SIX THOUSAND

00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:54.631
FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. SO FOR

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:55.799
ABOUT AN EIGHT MONTH WINDOW

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:56.900
YOU'VE GOT SEVENTY SEVEN

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:58.101
THOUSAND PEOPLE SAYING. I THANK

00:53:58.168 --> 00:54:00.236
MY IDENTITIES BEEN STOLEN YOU

HAVE COUNTLESS OTHER

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:02.739
INDIVIDUALS WHO AT THAT POINT

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:04.207
TIME MAY NOT EVEN KNOW. THAT

00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:05.842
THEIR IDENTITY HAD BEEN STOLEN

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:09.079
SO A HUGE ISSUE. AS FAR AS- NOT

00:54:09.145 --> 00:54:11.348
EDT NOT TAKING STEPS WHEN THEY

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:12.882
KNEW THEY HAD SOME SUSPICIOUS

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:14.851
ADRESSES. WE TALK IN THE AUDIT

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:16.853
REPORT. WHERE THEY STARTED TO

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.121
PUT SOME CONTROLS AROUND THAT

00:54:18.188 --> 00:54:20.123
BUT EVEN THEN WHEN WE LOOKED AT

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.725
SOME OF THOSE ADDRESSES WE

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:22.859
FOUND SOME THAT HAD NOT BEEN

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:24.694
SUSPENDED THAT. WERE CLEARLY

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.429
SUSPICIOUS ADDRESSES SO THEY

00:54:26.496 --> 00:54:27.731
HADN'T TAKEN THE APPROPRIATE

00:54:27.797 --> 00:54:30.734
STEPS. TO TRY TO CLAMP DOWN ON.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.668
ON SOME OF A FRAUD THAT WAS

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:33.470
OCCURRING. TO HIGH PROFILE

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:34.738
ISSUES YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF THE

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:36.306
BANK OF AMERICA WITH THE

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:39.643
BENEFIT CARDS. FROZE OVER THREE

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:40.810
HUNDRED THOUSAND ACCOUNTS. OUR

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:42.679
ISSUE IS I'S IMPORTANT TO BE

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:43.647
ABLE TO FREEZE THOSE ACCOUNTS

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:45.615
BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THE

00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:51.788
NATURE OF. HOW MANY OF THOSE

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:52.889
WERE LEGITIMATE BENEFIT

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.291
BENEFICIARIES VERSUS ACTUAL

00:54:55.358 --> 00:54:56.993
POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT. SO

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.128
THERE ARE PICKED INDIVIDUALS

00:54:58.194 --> 00:54:59.996
WHO HAD THEIR ACCOUNT FROZEN.

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:01.464
THAT WERE LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:03.433
BUT EDT AND DIDN'T WORK WOULD

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.734
BE OF A TO COME UP WITH A

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:06.803
PROTOCOL FOR. LET'S CLEAR SOME

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:08.872
OF THESE TO FREE UP THOSE ARE

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:09.673
YOU KNOW ON FREEZE THOSE

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:11.641
ACCOUNTS. SO WE REALLY HAD SOME

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:13.443
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THEY WERE

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.578
WORKING WITH B. OF A- TO

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:16.913
DETERMINE WHICH COUNTS SHOULD

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.781
BE FROZEN WHICH SHOULD BE

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:19.416
UNFROZEN THEY JUST. BASICALLY

00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:21.418
THE PENDULUM WAS SWINGING ONE

00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:22.218
WAY OR THE OTHER LET'S FREEZE

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:23.620
EVERYTHING NOW LET'S ON FREEZE

00:55:23.687 --> 00:55:25.088
EVERYTHING IT WASN'T A GOOD

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:27.223
STRATEGIC APPROACH. THE SECOND

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:29.092
HIGH PROFILE ISSUE OF COURSE IS

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:31.094
THE CROSS MATCHING- THIS IS

00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:33.096
WHERE. EDT WAS NOT CROSS

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:35.131
MATCHING ITS INFORMATION WITH

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:36.199
OUR STATE DEPARTMENT OF

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:37.934
CORRECTIONS. AND CERTAINLY NOT

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:41.037
WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AS

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:42.605
WELL AS LOCAL FACILITIES.

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:43.873
DURING THE AUDIT WE AYE AYE WE

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.709
IDENTIFIED ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:47.410
AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:49.045
HAD BEEN SENT OUT PAID OUT.

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:50.814
UNDER THE NAMES OF INCARCERATED

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.115
INDIVIDUALS SOME OF THOSE

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:53.016
INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE HAD THEIR

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:55.285
IDENTITY STOLEN SOME OF THOSE

00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:55.685
INDIVIDUALS MAY BE

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:57.520
FRAUDULENTLY. OBTAINING

00:55:57.587 --> 00:55:59.856
BENEFITS. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

00:55:59.923 --> 00:56:01.124
WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN WE

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:03.493
LOOKED WE FOUND A NATIONAL

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.795
STUDY THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN

00:56:05.862 --> 00:56:06.329
TWENTY SIXTEEN WHERE THEIR

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:08.198
WORKS UPWARDS OF THIRTY FIVE

00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:08.798
THIRTY SIX STATES THAT WE'RE

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.467
DOING THIS CROSS MATCHING. AND

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:12.469
IN FACT EDT BACK THEN HAD

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:13.803
NOTIFIED THE LEGISLATURE THIS

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.972
IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO DO. BUT

00:56:16.039 --> 00:56:17.240
HAD NEVER REALLY FOLLOWED

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:19.709
THROUGH WITH IT- SO IT'S MY

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:20.744
UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT SOME OF

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.312
THE LEGISLATION ADDRESSES THIS

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:23.646
ISSUE THIS WILL BE A HUGE

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:26.216
CONTROL THAT WILL ALLOW EDT. TO

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:28.017
IDENTIFY THOSE CROSS MATCHES

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:29.352
AND THEN BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE

00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:31.921
AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT. OF FRAUD

00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:33.723
IN THE FUTURE. AT THE LAST

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:34.958
ISSUE RELATED TO FRAUD

00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:36.192
DETECTION AND PREVENTION WE

00:56:36.259 --> 00:56:37.393
WANT TO LOOK AT THEIR STRUCTURE

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.696
WHAT KIND OF FRIED. A PROGRAM

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:41.731
DOES EDT HAVE AND THEN WHEN YOU

00:56:41.798 --> 00:56:43.333
LOOK IN THE AUDIT REPORT. AND

00:56:43.399 --> 00:56:44.667
WE PRESENTED THIS SENATE AND A

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.069
FIGURE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:47.003
DIFFERENT UNITS IT'S A

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.938
BASICALLY A PATCHWORK. THERE

00:56:49.005 --> 00:56:51.975
ISN'T AN OVER. OVERVIEW OR ARE

00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:54.010
AN INDIVIDUAL OR UNIT THAT HAD

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:55.812
RESPONSIBILITY FOR COORDINATING

00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:57.046
ALL THE FRAUD DETECTION

00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:59.048
PREVENTION EFFORTS. THAT EDT

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:00.717
WAS ENGAGING AND IT WOULD.

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:02.619
INDIVIDUALS HAD TO COMMUNICATE

00:57:02.685 --> 00:57:04.087
ACROSS DIFFERENT BRANCHES

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:05.522
DIFFERENT UNITS WITHIN THE DAY

00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:07.524
IT WAS. IT WAS NOT AN EFFECTIVE

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:10.093
PROCESS SO WE FELT THAT THEY

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:10.560
NEEDED TO ESTABLISH A

00:57:10.627 --> 00:57:12.695
CENTRALIZED UNIT. ET WAS NOT

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:15.165
MEASURING. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:16.699
ITS PROVOKED PREVENTION AND

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:18.001
DETECTION TOOL SO IT DIDN'T

00:57:18.067 --> 00:57:19.135
KNOW WHICH TOOLS WORK BETTER

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:20.670
THAN OTHERS DO WE NEED TO

00:57:20.737 --> 00:57:21.805
CONTINUE USING THIS TOOL IS IT

00:57:21.871 --> 00:57:23.573
REALLY EFFECTIVE. IF THIS ONE'S

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.874
NOT EFFECTIVE THEN LET'S NOT

00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:26.342
INVEST MORE RESOURCES IN THAT

00:57:26.409 --> 00:57:28.211
PARTICULAR TOOL. AND THE FINAL

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:29.112
ISSUE RELATED TO THAT IS IF

00:57:29.179 --> 00:57:30.113
YOU'RE NOT ASSESSING YOUR

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.881
TOOLS. YOU DON'T HAVE THE

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:34.150
ABILITY TO ADJUST YOUR EFFORTS

00:57:34.217 --> 00:57:36.252
DURING A HIGH DEMAND- TIME

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:38.688
FRAME. FOR EXAMPLE WE TALKED IN

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:40.723
THE MARCH OF TWENTY ELEVEN

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:42.859
REPORT AND THE FOLLOW UP. IN

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:44.527
TWENTY TWELVE. ABOUT THAT

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:46.729
RECESSION PLAN YOU NEED TO HAVE

00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:48.164
A RECESSION PLAN RECESSION

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:49.465
HAPPENS EVERY FIVE TO SIX

00:57:49.532 --> 00:57:50.934
YEARS. SO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.136
PLAN IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH THAT

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:55.238
NOBODY CERTAINLY EXPECTED. THE

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:56.973
THIS COUNTRY IN THIS WORLD TO

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:57.841
HAVE TO BE DEALING WITH A

00:57:57.907 --> 00:57:59.742
PANDEMIC OF THIS. OF THIS

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.611
ENORMITY BUT YOU IF WE HAD HAD

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:03.947
A RECESSION PLAN. AT LEAST WE

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:05.815
AS A STATE EDT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:06.850
ABLE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS

00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:09.886
STAFFING. WHAT KIND OF WORKLOAD

00:58:09.953 --> 00:58:11.354
ISSUES DO WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.556
CETERA SO. AGAIN WE FEEL THAT

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:15.091
THAT RECESSION PLAN WOULD HAVE

00:58:15.158 --> 00:58:16.059
TIED INTO SOME OF YOUR

00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:17.660
PREVENTION DETECTION TOOLS.

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:19.162
WHICH ONES ARE AFFECTED WHICH

00:58:19.229 --> 00:58:21.064
ONES WE WANT TO KEEP USING.

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:21.698
WHICH ONES ARE WE MORE

00:58:21.764 --> 00:58:23.766
COMFORTABLE BASICALLY DIALING

00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:25.235
BACK SO WE CAN FREE UP SOME OF

00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:27.070
THOSE STAFF TO DO OTHER THINGS.

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:29.038
SO THOSE ARE THAT'S GOOD. VERY

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:33.243

STILL NEED TO BE TAKEN TO

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:45.241
ADDRESS AREAS OF RISK. WHERE IF

THE JUNETWENTY TWENTY ONE.

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:16.706
AREA THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:19.909
IDENTIFIED KEY PROBLEMS WITH IT

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:22.378
SYSTEMS. THAT WERE CAUSING HANG

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:23.980
UPS IN CLAIMS PROCESING.

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:25.748
IMPROVEMENTS THAT THEY CAN MAKE

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:26.315
TO MAKE SURE THE CLAIMS ARE

01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:27.850
PROCESS MORE EFFECTIVELY. BUT

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:28.951
THAT WERE IN MARKING THOSE

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:30.386
EITHER PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:32.588
RIGHT NOW OUR AND- IN THE CASE

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:33.956

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.794
NEEDS TO CARRY OUT THOSE AND

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.695
HIS SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS SO

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:40.830
THEY'VE MADE GOOD PROGRESS IN

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:41.964
RECOGNIZING WHICH PARTS OF

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:44.267
THEIR IT SYSTEMS COULD MAKE

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:45.101
CLAIMS PROCESSING MORE

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:46.903
EFFECTIVE. NOW THEY NEED TO GO

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:48.938
AHEAD AND CARRY OUT THOSE

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:50.706
SYSTEM CHANGES. EDT IS ALSO

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:51.774
PRESENTING A MUCH MORE

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:53.009
TRANSPARENT PICTURE ON ITS

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:54.944
PUBLIC WEBSITE NOW. OF THE

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:56.779
CLAIMS BACKLOG DURING THE AUDIT

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:58.047
WE FOUND THAT THE CLAIMS

01:01:58.114 --> 01:01:59.182
BACKLOG NUMBERS ON EDIE'S

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:00.583
WEBSITE WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.251
ACCURATE THEY DIDN'T SEPARATE

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:03.119
OUT THE CLAIMS THAT WERE

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.254
BACKLOGGED TO DO DVD DIS IN

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:07.590
ACTION. VERSES THOSE WERE EDIE

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:09.025
HAD CONTACTED THE CLAIMANT AND

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:10.827
WAS NOW WAITING TO RECEIVE

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:11.327
DOCUMENTS BACK FROM THE

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:13.596
CLAIMANT. THE PUBLIC WEBSITE

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:15.565
NOW DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB AT

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:16.966
SEGREGATING THOSE TWO

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.234
POPULATION SO THAT THE PUBLIC

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:19.702
IN THE LEGISLATURE CAN HAVE A

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:22.538
MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:24.474
WHAT EDIE'S BACKLOG LOOKS LIKE.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.542
I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE DEFERRED

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:27.844
WORKLOAD THAT THE STATE AUDITOR

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.745
MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO SO IT'S

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:31.047
TRUE DURING THE PAST THE HEIGHT

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:33.049
OF THE PANDEMIC EDT SUSPENDED

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:34.817
WORK IN TWO KEY AREAS THAT WE

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:36.152
KNOW IN THE AUDIT REPORT. THEY

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:37.453
STOPPED MAKING ELIGIBILITY

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.288
DETERMINATIONS VIRTUALLY ALL OF

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:41.457
THEM. AND STAY FOR A SHORT

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:42.492
PERIOD OF TIME STOPPED

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:44.026
RECEIVING THESE REGULAR ONGOING

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.928
CERTIFICATIONS OF CONTINUED

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:48.865
ELIGIBILITY. DOES REPRESENT AN

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.833
ENORMOUS BACKLOG OF WORK THE

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.869
EDT NOW NEDS TO PROCESS AND SO

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.704
WE MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:57.006
ABOUT HOW IT COULD DO SO. THE

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:57.874
ENCOURAGING THINGS THAT IT'S

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.242
ALREADY DONE TO IMPLEMENT OUR

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:00.610
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FIRST IT'S

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:02.111
COMPLETED A RISK ASSESSMENT OF

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:04.180
THAT DEFERRED BACKLOG SO WE

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:05.648
WANTED THEM TO GO THROUGH AND

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:07.049
IDENTIFY AMONGST ALL OF THE

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.684
DEFERRED WORK WHAT IS THE

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:09.986
HIGHEST RISK FOR POTENTIALLY

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.587
HAVING BEEN OVERPAID OR

01:03:11.654 --> 01:03:13.756
IMPROPERLY PAID. SO WHEN YOU'RE

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:14.690
NOT DOING ELIGIBILITY TO HER

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:15.892
DETERMINATIONS YOU COULD

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.593
POTENTIALLY PAY SOMEBODY WHO'S

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.794
NOT ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:21.264
THOSE. BENEFITS OR MAYBE NOT

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.431
FOR ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:25.134
THEY WERE. PROVIDED SO EATING

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:26.669
FIRST IN ORDER TO PROCESS THIS

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:28.638
ENORMOUS BACKLOG NEED TO FIGURE

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:30.206
OUT WHAT IS THE HIGHEST RISK

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:31.807
WORK IN THE BACKLOG THEY'VE

01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:34.644
DONE THAT NOW THEY HAVE. THAT

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.412
RISK ASSESSMENT COMPLETED. THEN

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.513
THEY'VE GONE AHEAD AND ALSO

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.348
DEVELOPED A WORKLOAD PLAN FOR

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:40.616
HOW TO PROGRESS THROUGH THAT

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:42.318
WORKLOAD. SO NOW THEY HAVE

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:43.853
DEVELOPED A TIMELINE BY WHICH

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.288
THEY EXPECTS TO PROGRESS

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:46.956
THROUGH THAT WORK. IT

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:48.724
CONTRACTED OUT FOR ASSISTANCE

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:49.659
TO COMPLETE THAT WORK AS WELL

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.694
AS OTHER ON GOING HIGHER THAN

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:52.929
NORMAL WORKLOADS THAT THEY'RE

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:55.464
FACING. THE BIGGEST AREA OF

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.366
RISK NOW REMAINS THAT EDIE HAS

01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:58.134
TO ACTUALLY EXECUTE THAT

01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:00.069
WORKLOAD PLAN SO WE'LL BE

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:00.970
CONTINUING TO FOLLOW UP WITH

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:01.871
THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:03.806
STAY ON SCHEDULE. THERE IS A

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:06.709
WINDOW WITHIN WHICH EDT HAS.

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.244
TIME TO RECOUP IMPROPER

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:10.680
PAYMENTS TO REQUEST REPAYMENT

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:11.280
OF FUNDS THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:13.616
BEEN PAID. BUT THAT WINDOW WILL

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.218
EVENTUALLY CLOSE AND IT'S

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:16.385
IMPORTANT THAT EDT COMPLETE

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:18.421
ITS- ASSESSMENT AND CONDUCTING

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:20.690
OF THIS BACKLOG WORK. BEFORE

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:22.091
THAT WINDOW CLOSES THEIR WORK

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:24.060
LOT LOAD PLAN RIGHT NOW HAS

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:26.229
THEM SCHEDULED TO DO SO. NOW WE

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:27.830
NEED TO SEE THEM CARRIED OUT

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:29.865
THAT WORKLOAD PLAN. SO THAT'S

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:32.535
CLAIMS PROCESSING ON THE SECOND

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:33.169
PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WE'LL TALK

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:35.104
ABOUT THE CALL CENTER. AND THE

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:36.272
THINGS THAT EDT IS DONE TO

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:39.041
IMPROVE ITS- ABILITY TO MANAGE

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:41.110
ITS CALL CENTER EFFECTIVELY. IT

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:42.545
HAS ADDED THOSE CONVENIENCE

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:43.813
FEATURES THAT WERE LACKING WHEN

01:04:43.879 --> 01:04:45.948
IT. ADOPTED A NEW CALL CENTER

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:48.217
SYSTEM. SO IT IS ADDED THE PRE

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.586
RECORDED MESSAGES IF IT'S ADDED

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:51.821
THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE A CALL

01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:53.389
BACK- INSTEAD OF WAITING ON

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:54.890
HOLD SO THOSE ARE POSITIVE

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:56.959
CONSUMER FACING. IMPROVEMENTS

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:59.428

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:13.409
SO THAT IT CAN BETTER ASSIST

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:14.777
CLAIMANTS THROUGH NON CALL

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:16.879

THE FIRST TIME THEY CALL.

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:23.819
WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW THOUGH IS

01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:24.887
THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.389
ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS CARRYING

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:28.024
THEM OUT SO WE'LL SEE TOWARDS

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.825
THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TO. THE

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.961
AREAS WERE STILL ASSESSING IS

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:32.495
PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ARE

CALLING EDIE'S CALL CENTER. SO

01:06:13.969 --> 01:06:15.771
IMPORTANT FIRST STEPS HERE IN

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:17.239
THE AREA OF THE CALL CENTER BUT

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:18.808
EDIE NOW HAS TO CONDUCT THIS

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:21.177
REGULAR DATA REVIEW AND USE IT

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:21.711
TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE THEIR

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:24.914
OPERATIONS. AND THEN LASTLY ON

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.182
THE THIRD PAGE THE AREA FRAUD

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:28.584
PREVENTION AND DETECTION. AGAIN

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.586
GOOD EARLY FIRST STEPS FROM EDT

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:31.620
THEY'VE IMPROVED THEIR

01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:32.988
COORDINATION WITH BANK OF

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:34.590
AMERICA THEY HAVE A

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.125
COMPREHENSIVE WAY OF REVIEWING

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:38.094
THE ACCOUNT ACTIVITY NOW WHICH

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.829
ACCOUNTS ARE FROZEN WHICH

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.664
ACCOUNTS ARE BEING UNFROZEN WHY

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:43.432
ARE THOSE ACCOUNTS BEING FROZEN

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:45.301
OR UNFROZEN THEIR SYSTEMS FOR

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:46.535
TRACKING ALL THAT INFORMATION

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:48.237
ARE IMPROVED SINCE THE TIME WE

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:49.939
WERE DOING OUR AUDIT. THEY'VE

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:52.007
ALSO PROVIDED CLEAR INFORMATION

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.809
ON THEIR WEBSITE. FOR

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:55.111
INDIVIDUALS WHOSE IDENTITIES

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:56.812
WERE STOLEN HOW TO RESOLVE

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:59.014
THEIR PENDING TAX LIABILITIES

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:01.717
AS A RESULT OF THAT. SOME OF

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:02.251
THESE BENEFITS ARE TAXABLE

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:04.520
BENEFITS. IF YOUR IDENTITY WAS

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:05.621
STOLEN AND YOU NEVER ACTUALLY

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:06.722
RECEIVE THEM YOU MAY BE FACING

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:08.824
A TAX LIABILITY THAT YOU DON'T

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:11.227
ACTUALLY. OWN EDIE'S PROVIDED

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:12.795
CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS NOW ABOUT

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:13.829
HOW TO CONTACT THEM AND GET

YOUR ISSUE RESOLVED SO GRAND

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:18.667
REALLY GOOD FIRST STEPS. WITH

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:19.969
RESPECT TO FRAUD PREVENTION AND

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.170
DETECTION I WANT TO FOCUS ON

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:22.938
TWO AREAS ONE IS THE CREATION

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.607
OF A FRAUD UNIT AS THE STATE

01:07:24.673 --> 01:07:26.876
AUDITOR MENTIONED. A MOMENT AGO

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:28.277
WHEN WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:29.211
EDIE'S FRAUD PREVENTION

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:31.013
APPROACHES A PATCHWORK

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.782
PATCHWORK APPROACH. IT WAS

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:35.317
DEPENDED ON SIX DIFFERENT UNITS

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:36.852
WITH A NEEDY ALL COORDINATING

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:38.120
EFFECTIVELY WITH ONE ANOTHER SO

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:39.688
WE RECOMMENDED THEY CREATE A

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:42.291
FRAUD UNIT TO CENTRALIZE. THAT

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:44.260
VIEW OF FRAUD PREVENTION AND

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:46.796
DETECTION. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:48.030
IN LINE WITH FRAUD PREVENTION

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:49.899
BEST PRACTICES SO THAT UNIT

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:51.066
NEEDS TO BE TASKED WITH THE

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:53.302
RIGHT. RESPONSIBILITIES AND

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:54.203
THEN ENABLED WITH THE RIGHT

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:55.971
AUTHORITIES. THE GOD NEWS IS

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:57.673
EDT IS DONE THAT THEY HAVE

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:58.974
CREATED THAT UNIT. THEY HAVE

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:00.342
TASKED IT WITH THE RIGHT

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:01.710
RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEY HAVE

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:02.745
ASSIGNED AT THE PROPER

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:03.946
AUTHORITY WHATWE'RE WAITING ON

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:05.881
NOW IS THE FOR THAT UNIT TO BE

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:06.982
FULLY STAFFED. THEY ARE

01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:08.284
RECRUITING THE MISTER HARRIS

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.085
THAT OR YOU CONTINUE ON THIS IS

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:11.153
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.088
IMPACTFUL IS THERE A WAY THAT-

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:14.123
SOME FOLKS CAN ACCESS THIS

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:16.125
DOCUMENT ONLINE IS AVAILABLE ON

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:18.027

ON THE WEBSITE THIS FORMAT WE

01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:33.809

TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT IN THESE

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:43.065

OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:08.624
THINGS THAT. WERE IDENTIFIED.

01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:10.526
TEN YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:14.063
TWO YEARS AGO. WHAT AT ITS WHAT

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:16.031
ADVICE WOULD OU LEAVE US WITH

TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT

01:12:17.032 --> 01:12:18.667
SITTING HERE AGAIN TEN YEARS

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:20.736
FROM NOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:23.639
THAT THEY FOLLOW THROUGH AND

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:25.074
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.341
THAT ARE GOING TO ENSURE THAT

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:28.277
THAT THAT THIS IS THE LAST TIME

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:30.012
WE DEAL WITH THIS FIASCO. WELL

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:32.047
I WAS GOING TO FALL ON THE

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.582
ANSWER MISTER HARRIS IS GAVE IN

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:35.417
AND THE DISCUSSION YOU JUST

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:36.819
SIXTEEN MONTHS OF HEARINGS THE

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:38.620
LEGISLATURE WHAT WHAT MY OFFICE

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:40.723
HAS BEEN DOING MORE AND MORE IN

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:42.825
THE LAST FEW YEARS IS FOCUSING

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.326
ON MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.829
THE LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE WE

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:47.796
DON'T HAVE IT AT THE STATE

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:48.697
AUDITOR DOES NOT HAVE

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:50.332
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WE CAN'T

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:51.834
FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.103
CERTAIN THINGS BUT CERTAINLY WE

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:55.003
CAN PARTNER WITH THE

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:56.605
LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE STRONG

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:57.539
OVERSIGHT TO GIVE YOU THE

01:12:57.606 --> 01:12:59.708
INFORMATION YOU NEED. TO

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:01.110
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:03.712
NEED TO PUT THIS IN STATUTE AND

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:05.447
IT'S NOT JUST EIGHTY IT'S OTHER

01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:06.849
STATE DEPARTMENTS IF THEY HAVE

01:13:06.915 --> 01:13:08.150
SOMETHING IN STATURE THAT

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.651
THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO THEIR

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:10.986
MUCH MORE INCLINED TO DO IT

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:12.688
THEN IF THE STATE AUDITOR TELLS

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.456
AND TO DO IT NOW I. EIGHTY I

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:16.492
THINK AND THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:17.693
WITH THEM OVER THE COURSE OF

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.528
THE LAST YEAR OR TEN MONTHS

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.163
THAT WE'VE BEEN AFTER WE ISSUED

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.798
THE REPORT HAS BEEN VERY

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:24.666
RESPONSIVE TO A LOT OF THE

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:27.169
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:27.803
SOME OF THE PROGRESS. HAS BEEN

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:29.505
SLOWER THAN WE WOULD LIKE AS AS

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:31.774
MR HARRIS SAID. SOME OF IT'S ON

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.875
PACE SOME OF IT IS A LITTLE TOO

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:34.643
SLOW. LIKE WE'RE EXPECTING SOME

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:36.011
THINGS AND JUNE OF TWENTY

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.179
TWENTY ONE. BUT YOU HAVE TO

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.814
ACKNOWLEDGE SOME OF THAT IS I.

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:40.716
T. THEY HAVE A LEGACY SYSTEM

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.918
MOST. WORKFORCE DATA SYSTEMS

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.253
ACROSS THE COUNTRY OUR LEGACY

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:46.188
SYSTEMS SO WE HAVE TO CHIP AWAY

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.356
AT THAT AND TRY TO IMPROVE

01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:50.225
THAT. BUT MY THOUGHTS OR MY

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:53.295
OBSERVATION IS. I THINK. STRONG

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:54.696
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WHICH WE

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.198
HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST YEAR AND

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:58.000
A HALF. AND A PARTNERSHIP

01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:58.967
BETWEEN MY OFFICE AND THE

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:00.736
LEGISLATURE AND MAKING SURE

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:03.438
THAT IF THERE ARE THINGS WE

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:03.972
THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:06.241
SHOULD. YOU KNOW AN ACT TO TRY

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:09.144
TO. TRY TO GET INTO STATE LAW.

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:10.946
IT WILL COMPEL A DEPARTMENT

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.114
LIKE ANY DAY AND SOME OF THE

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.382
OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT WE OUGHT

01:14:13.448 --> 01:14:15.551
IT. TO ACTUALLY DO THINGS THE

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.219
OTHER THING IS OUR FOLLOW UP

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.987
PROCESS AND HAVING THESE KINDS

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.756
OF HEARINGS WHERE. THE

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:22.724
DEPARTMENT KNOWS I MEAN THAT

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:23.525
THEY WERE CONTACTING MISTER

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:25.994
HARRIS. ON THURSDAY I MET WITH

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:27.462
HIM BEFORE I WORK FROM HOME ON

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:28.831
FRIDAY AND HE WAS. CALLING ON

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.232
FRIDAY EDIE'S TRYING TO STILL

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.567
GET ME SOME INFORMATION BECAUSE

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:33.335
THEY KNEW. THIS HEARING WAS

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:34.837
HAPPENING AND THEY WANTED US TO

01:14:34.903 --> 01:14:36.839
BE ABLE TO SAY. YEAH THEY'VE

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:38.640
MADE PROGRESS AS FAR AS PUTTING

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.075
A PLAN TOGETHER PUTTING THAT

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.777
WERE- THAT FRIED UNIT TOGETHER

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:42.911
THEY'RE STARTING TO STAFF A

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:44.980
UNIT. SO I THINK PERSISTENT

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:46.815
OVERSIGHT AND I KNOW IT'S A LOT

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:47.449
OF WORK BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:48.951
OF RESPONSIBILITIES. BUT

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.219
PERSISTENT OVER STATE BY THE

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:51.086
LEGISLATURE BY THE VARIOUS

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:52.955
COMMITTEES. AND CERTAINLY

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:55.290
PUTTING THINGS INTO STATE LAW.

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:57.259
AND THEN USING THIS OFFICE.

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.760
LONG AFTER I'M GONE THIS OFFICE

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:00.495
IS GOING TO BE FINE. I'M GONNA

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:02.664
MISS IT I'M HONORED TO HAVE

01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:05.167
SERVED AS LONG AS I DID- BUT I

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:06.501
THINK THAT PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.136
THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE THE

THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.776
ADDRESS THE WORKLOAD BACKLOG.

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:56.878
BUT AUDITOR HOW YOU MENTIONED

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:58.847
BRIEFLY AND ISSUE RELATED TO I.

01:21:58.913 --> 01:22:01.516
T. AND TECHNOLOGY TESE LEGACY.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:04.019
OF PROGRAMS THAT DON'T FUNCTION

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:07.055
IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. I'M CURIOUS

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:09.491
IF- YOU CAN SHARE. TIMELINE IN

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:11.826
TERMS OF WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:14.629
IN MANY WAYS. TURN THIS TITANIC

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:17.032
AROUND- AND REALLY IMPROVE THE

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:20.402
TECHNOLOGY WITHIN EDT. SO THAT

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:22.203
WE HAVE A MORE MODERN SYSTEM

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:24.172
THAT CAN REALLY TAKE INTO

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:26.941
ACCOUNT THE NEEDS OF THE STATE-

01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:27.876
I KNOW IT CAN'T HAPPEN

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:29.911
OVERNIGHT. BUT I REALLY DO

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:31.146
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO SET

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:33.148
GOALS AND WE NEED TO MEET THOSE

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:34.449
GOALS. IN ORDER FOR THE

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:36.017
DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:37.385
AND REALLY TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:39.220
THAT THE SAFETY NET. THAT

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:40.588
REALLY SHOULD JUST BE A

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:42.724
FUNCTIONING SAFETY NET. DOESN'T

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.125
HAVE PEOPLE FALLING THROUGH IT

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:45.760
BECAUSE OF THESE GAPING HOLES

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:46.861
WITHIN THE SAFETY NET AND A

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:48.630
LARGE PART OF THAT. IS SIMPLY

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:50.031
NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE WE

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:51.666
PUT BEHIND IT HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:53.635
WE HIRE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:55.770
TRAINED. TWO HUNDRED AND

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:56.638
SEVENTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:59.274
DOLLAR INVESTMENT AND HIRING

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:01.509
PEOPLE. WHAT'S THE USE IF THE

01:23:01.576 --> 01:23:03.645
SYSTEM IS SO SLOW. THAT IT

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:05.714
CAN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A NEW

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.949
WORK FORCE OR THE NEED FROM

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:09.284
PEOPLE REQUIRING ASSISTANCE

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:12.954
FROM EDT. MISTER HARRIS CAN

ASSIST ME WITH THIS BUT AS HE

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:16.024
JUST INDICATED THAT THERE NEEDS

01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:17.792
TO BE AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH.

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:20.595
SO ONE OF ONE OF BASED ON MY

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:22.330
EXPERIENCE AS THE AUDITOR AND

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:23.465
LOOKING AT A LOT OF I. T.

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.666
PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:26.701
OBVIOUSLY. THE SYSTEM'S EDT

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:28.903
SYSTEM IS HUGE AND THEY NEED TO

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:30.872
DO T INCREMENTALLY SO I THINK

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:32.073

THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THAT ARE.

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:40.048
CRITICAL MISSION CRITICAL- SO

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:41.916
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WHEN WE LOOK

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:43.485
AT DEPARTMENTS THAT WANT TO

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:44.853
UNDERTAKE AND I. T. PROJECT

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:46.888
EITHER DESIGNING A NEW PROJECT

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:49.624
OR IMPLEMENTING CHANGES TO AN

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.826
EXISTING PROJECT. IS SCOPE

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:53.962
CREEP SO YOU MADE USE ME YOU

INCOME AND CROWN- PROSTATE

01:23:57.165 --> 01:23:58.500
WE'RE GONNA USE AN INCREMENTAL

01:23:58.566 --> 01:23:59.100
PROCESS WHICH THE DEPARTMENT

01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:03.638
TECHNOLOGY- ADVISES START

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:05.173
SHOULD PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.076

CRITICAL THINGS THAT WE NEED TO

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:12.680

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:13.948
VENDOR GETS IN ITS AS WELL

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:15.650

THEN YOU GET THE SCOPE CREEP

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.921
NOW YOUR YEARS AND YEARS AWAY

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:22.023
FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH.

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.892
THE MISSION CRITICAL ARE

01:24:23.958 --> 01:24:24.959
CHANGES THAT WOULD BE

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.628
BENEFICIAL TO THE PEOPLE WHO

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.930
ARE ACCESSING THE SYSTEM SO

01:24:28.997 --> 01:24:30.932
WHAT I BELIEVE SHOULD HAPPEN

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:33.601
IS. EDT IDENTIFYING THIS

01:24:33.668 --> 01:24:34.803
INCREMENTAL APPROACH AND THEN

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:36.805
SETTING TIMELINES WHAT ARE THE

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:39.007
SPECIFIC TIMELINES FOR US BEING

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:40.642
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE MISSION

01:24:40.708 --> 01:24:42.811
CRITICAL CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:45.180
AND LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT AND

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:47.615
NOT ALLOW ANY SCOPE CREEP-

01:24:47.682 --> 01:24:48.917
THOSE ARE NICE TO HAVES AND WE

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:49.751
CAN DO THAT DOWN THE ROAD BUT

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:50.919
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET MONEY TO

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:52.086
DO THAT UNTIL YOU ACCOMPLISH

01:24:52.153 --> 01:24:53.655

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:11.325
OVERWHELMS THE SISTER. IN JULY

01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:12.860
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE MILLION

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:15.863
CALLS A WEEK. IT'S NOW DOWN TO

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.898
A MILLION BUT LET ME CLARIFY

01:37:17.965 --> 01:37:20.167
THAT NUMBER BECAUSE PERCENTAGES

01:37:20.234 --> 01:37:22.069
ARE ALWAYS TAKEN FROM THE

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:25.706
LARGEST NUMBER. THAT NUMBER

01:37:25.773 --> 01:37:29.510
REPRESENTS A HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:37:29.577 --> 01:37:30.644
ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND

01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:32.947

HUNDRED AND TWO OF THOSE CALLS

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:41.689
WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 95% OF

01:37:41.755 --> 01:37:43.724
THE CALLS. THE REST WERE REPEAT

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:45.993

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.195
SPEED IN ANSWERING HAS IMPROVED

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:49.897

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:52.733
CALL THE ALL VALUE ON WEEKENDS

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.269

01:37:55.336 --> 01:37:57.571
SUBSTANTIALLY. WE ARE IMPROVING

01:37:57.638 --> 01:37:59.073
IMPROVING SERVICE QUALITY SO

01:37:59.139 --> 01:38:01.609
THAT WE CAN RESULT CALLER

01:38:01.675 --> 01:38:04.211
ISSUES THE FIRST TIME. THIS IS

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:06.146
AN IMPROVEMENT BUT THE OBO

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:08.315
CALLS AND THE REPEAT CALLS CAN

01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:10.351
STILL OVERWHELM THE SYSTEM

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:13.687
DURING THE WEEK DAYS. THE

01:38:13.754 --> 01:38:15.689

01:38:15.756 --> 01:38:17.791
LESS CALL STRUCTURE TRAFFIC IN

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.560
THE EVENINGS AND THE WEEKENDS.

01:38:19.627 --> 01:38:22.363

02:14:53.752 --> 02:14:55.120
THIS RECESSION WAS ONE THAT WAS

02:14:55.187 --> 02:14:57.422
VERY UNIQUE AND THAT THE ONSET

02:14:57.489 --> 02:14:59.758
OF IT WAS SO QUICK AND THAT

02:14:59.825 --> 02:15:02.427
THE- IMPACT TO- CLAIMANTS IN

02:15:04.563 --> 02:15:06.231
SUDDEN AND IT CAUSED MASSIVE

THE BACK END IS THE RECOVERY IS

02:15:14.573 --> 02:15:15.540
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE

02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:16.274
RECOVERY WASN'T ADDRESS

02:15:16.341 --> 02:15:18.543

DON'T HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL GROUP

02:23:31.936 --> 02:23:33.671
OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE DEDICATED TO

02:23:33.738 --> 02:23:35.139
GETTING THIS WORK DONE. AND

02:23:35.206 --> 02:23:36.941
THAT THEY ARE COMPETENT WE HAVE

02:23:37.008 --> 02:23:38.810
A LIBRARY THAT OUR STAFF IS

02:23:38.876 --> 02:23:40.144

THAT BECAUSE I RUN ALL THE

02:23:41.179 --> 02:23:44.716
DEPARTMENTS. OKAY SO THERE'S NO

02:23:44.782 --> 02:23:45.249

SYSTEMS. THE BUSINESS RULES

02:23:53.458 --> 02:23:54.959

OPERATING UNDER. THE LEGACY

02:23:57.996 --> 02:23:59.998
SYSTEM THAT IT HAS HAD TO

02:24:00.064 --> 02:24:03.534
CONTEND WITH. THE NEW RULES AND

02:24:03.601 --> 02:24:05.636
NEW PROGRAMS WERE ON A GESTURE

02:24:05.703 --> 02:24:08.006
THAT CAME TO EDT THOSE WERE A

02:24:08.072 --> 02:24:10.241
LARGE PART OF THE PROBLEMS FOR

COMES INTO PLAY IS JUST THE

02:30:42.233 --> 02:30:43.434
ESTABLISHMENT WE CAN CONTINUE

02:30:43.501 --> 02:30:45.269
COLLECTION EFFORTS BEYOND THAT

02:30:45.336 --> 02:30:48.372
TIME FRAME I'M SO LONG AS IT'S

02:30:48.439 --> 02:30:48.973
ESTABLISHED WITHIN THAT PERIOD

02:30:49.039 --> 02:30:51.409

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:30.548
ONE THAT ARE EITHER. PARTIALLY

IF YOU CAN TAKE THEM OFF NOW

02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:37.154
THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF NOT IF

YOU CAN INCLUDE THAT AS A POINT

02:31:38.522 --> 02:31:41.225

02:31:52.970 --> 02:31:57.908
TIME SO- WHICH WE WOKE UP- BUT

02:31:57.975 --> 02:31:59.109
THEY'RE GONNA BE MONITORED OVER

02:31:59.176 --> 02:32:00.978
TIME SO THE FIRSTPART OF IT IS

02:32:01.045 --> 02:32:02.213
A COMPLETE IS COMPLETE BUT THE

02:32:02.279 --> 02:32:03.614
REST HAS TO BE SOUGHT. THE

02:32:03.681 --> 02:32:05.549
DECISION OF THE STATE AUDITOR

02:32:05.616 --> 02:32:08.719

02:32:08.786 --> 02:32:10.521
SUFFICIENT OVER TIME. THE

02:32:10.588 --> 02:32:13.357

02:32:41.919 --> 02:32:42.920
THE PURVIEW OF THE STATE

02:32:42.987 --> 02:32:44.588
