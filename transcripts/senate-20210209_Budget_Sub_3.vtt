TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO ABOUT

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:55.601
FOUR HUNDRED AND- EIGHTY TWO

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.203
THOUSAND CASES. I WITH THAT I

YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT IN

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:11.283
TERMS OF THE APPLICATION

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.552
DENIALS THE AVERAGE DENIAL RATE

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:15.054
THAT WE SEE FOR APPLICATIONS

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.822
DURING THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:18.390
THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IS

00:14:18.457 --> 00:14:19.892
SIXTY PERCENT. AND THAT'S

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.827
COMPLETE IN COMPARISON TO ABOUT

00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:23.762
40% IN THE YEAR PRIOR IN TWENTY

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:26.098
NINETEEN- SO THAT THE TO SORT

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.667
OF DRIVERS THAT WERE SEEN- AS

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:30.135
MAIN FACTORS FOR APPLICATIONS

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:32.204
AND I ALSO- HAVE BEEN STABLE

00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:33.706
ACROSS BECAUSE IT INCLUDED

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:36.375
PERIODS. AND SO THOSE TWO ARE-

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:38.644
THE FIRST- FAILURE TO COMPLY

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.013
WITH PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS-

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.948
WHICH ESSENTIALLY ARE.

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:44.817
CONSISTENT FOR ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:46.218
50% OF ALL TO NILES IN ANY

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:48.754
GIVEN MONTH- REGARDLESS OF THE

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:51.557
PANDEMIC RATE- THE OTHERS SORT

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:53.759
OF DRIVER IS INCOME THAT

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.828
EXCEEDS OUR STANDARDS. AND THE

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:58.130
DOCKS AND ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT

00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:01.100
22% OF THE TOTAL TO NILES- NOW

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:04.103
INITIALLY DURING- THE ONSET OF

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:05.838
COLLUDED- DENIALS IN THIS

00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:08.073
CATEGORY WERE LARGELY REDUCED

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.442
TO ABOUT 17% OR SO- BUT THEY

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:11.944
SLOWLY STARTED TO INCREASE TO

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:16.682
ABOUT 25% OF THE DONT. DENIALS

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:21.253
IN THE MOST RECENT. SEPTEMBER

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.888
OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER OF LAST

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:28.994
YEAR. IN TERMS OF OUR

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:31.664
DISCONTINUANCE- OR WHAT WE CALL

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.067
THE EXITS- FROM CAL WORKS PRIOR

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:38.170
TO KOBE THERE WERE ABOUT TWENTY

00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:38.771
FIVE TO THIRTY THOUSAND CASES

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:40.205
EXITING CAL WORKS AND ANY

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:42.341
PARTICULAR MONTH AND SINCE THE

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:44.643
BEGINNING OF COLLUDED WITH THE

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.913
RECESSION- WE HAVE STARTED TO

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.418
SEE OUR DECREASES- IN MARCH OF

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:54.353
TWENTY TWENTY WE HAD ABOUT

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.387
THIRTEEN THOUSAND EXITS. IN

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:57.423
APRIL IT WENT DOWN SLIGHTLY TO

00:15:57.489 --> 00:16:00.592
ABOUT FIVE- FIVE THOUSAND EXITS

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:03.862
AND THEN IN ME- IT WENT- UP TO

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:05.531
ABOUT NINE THOUSAND EXITS AND

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:08.267
SO BEGINNING IN JUNE OR SO- WE

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:11.337
SAW THAT- CASES WERE COMING

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:13.372
BACK TO NORMAL LEVELS HOWEVER

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:15.841
IN MOST RECENT- THE MOST RECENT

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:17.309
THREE MONTHS OF DATA THAT WE

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:19.078
HAVE WE STARTED TO SEE HIGHER

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:22.681
THAN PRE COBIT LEVELS- OF EXITS

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:25.184
AND THAT'S NEARLY THIRTY FIVE

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.685
THOUSAND EXITS A MONTH. AND SO

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.420
THEN THE TWO FACTORS THAT ARE

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:30.489
DRIVING THIS- BASED ON THE DATA

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:33.125
THAT WE HAVE- IS THE FIRST THAT

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:33.826
YOU KNOW FOLKS THAT ARE

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:35.194
EXCLUDED BY LAW FOR REASONS

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.029
OTHER THAN TIME LIMITS AND

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:39.598
CITIZENSHIP SO THIS MAY INCLUDE

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.867
CLIENTS WHO ARE DISCONTINUED AT

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:43.869
AS A RESULT OF PERHAPS NOT

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:44.703
COMPLETING THEIR

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.871
REDETERMINATION REQUIREMENTS

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.906
RIGHT- THAT TENDS TO BE THE

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:49.007
MOST COMMON REASON FOR

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:50.709
DISCONTINUING- INCREASE OVER

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:53.011
TWO MONTHS- COUNTY FOR ABOUT

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:56.648
40% OR SO OF THOSE EXITS-

00:16:56.715 --> 00:16:58.484
HOWEVER WE DID SEE THIS

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.352
PARTICULAR ITEM DECREASE.

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:02.654
DRAMATICALLY TO ABOUT 8% IN MAY

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:06.759
OF LAST YEAR- BEFORE IT NEARLY-

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.994
FOR GOING UP AGAIN I TO ABOUT

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:11.897
70% IN LATE NOVEMBER OF TWENTY

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:14.566
TWENTY- THE OTHER FACTOR THAT

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:16.802
WE'VE IDENTIFIED IS DRIVING THE

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.571
EXITS IS- EXCESSIVE INCOME AND

00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:22.608
SO- THIS TYPICALLY IS A FACTOR

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:27.246
FOR DISCONTINUANCE- AND YOU

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:28.514
KNOW IT SORT OF HAS. HAS

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.449
BETWEEN OF LAST YEAR THROUGH NO.

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:32.751
OF LAST YEAR RANGING ANYWHERE

00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:36.555
FROM ABOUT. 25% 26% IN TERMS

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:40.859
OF- IT'S CAUSING DISCONTINUANCE

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:43.796
THIS CONTINUANCES OR EXITS- IN

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:46.265
TERMS OF SOME OF THE FACTORS

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:47.366
THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THIS

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.101
OR PERHAPS YOU KNOW FOLKS ARE

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:50.402
RECEIVING OTHER BENEFITS OR

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:53.906
OTHER PENSION- INCREASES- IN

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:55.407
THAT PARTICULAR LINE ITEM WE

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:57.609
SAW THAT- INCREASE FROM ABOUT

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.611
TWENTY. PERCENT 237% SO

00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:01.180
DEFINITELY PLAYED A ROLE THERE

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.415
AND CONTRIBUTING TO EXITS ON

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.818
THE OTHER IS EARNINGS AND SO-

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:08.387
WHAT WE SAW IS THAT IT WENT

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:12.057
FROM ABOUT 80% 265% DURING THE-

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:14.726
EARLY CODE MONTHS- AND BY JUNE

00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:16.462
OR SO LAST YEAR OUR RATIOS HAD

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:18.764
RETURNED. TO PRE COOKED AMOUNTS

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:23.235
AND HAVE STAYED. STEADY FOR THE

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:23.902
MOST PART SINCE THAT. ANY

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:26.872
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. BUT I

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.373
GUESS I WOULD I WOULD ASK ARE

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.242
WE SEEING SIMILAR THINGS IN

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:31.510
OTHER STATES RIGHT IT SEEMS

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:32.544
LIKE YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THIS

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:34.580
HUGE PANDEMIC IT'S AN ECONOMIC

00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:35.681
CRISIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:39.384
YET OUR CASELOADS ARE DOWN SO

00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:39.952
WHERE. WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:42.754
GOING. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:43.789
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK AT THE

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:45.023
NATIONAL LEVEL A LOT OF THE

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:50.195
TICKET HAS BEEN DELAYED- CFN

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:52.898
ASKED- FOR. SORT OF UPDATES

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.433
FROM OTHER STATES- WE'VE

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.002
CONTINUOUSLY TRIED O. REMAIN

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:58.437
IN CONTACT WITH OTHER STATE

00:18:58.504 --> 00:18:59.872
ADMINISTRATORS OF THE KIND OF

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:01.773
PROGRAM- BUT WE DON'T HAVE

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.841
SOLID DATA THAT WE CAN POINT

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:04.309
POINT TWO. ON THE OTHER

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:06.044
RESOURCE THAT WE CAN GO TO IS-

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:07.579
THAT MUCH A PROBLEM POLICY

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:09.414
PROJECTS SO. WE CAN FOLLOW UP

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:11.316
AND PROVIDE YOU WITH. ANY

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.684
INFORMATION WE RECEIVE BUT WE

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:14.052
JUST DON'T HAVE IT AT THIS TIME

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:15.420
IT JUST IT JUST SEEMS COUNTER

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:17.456
INTUITIVE AND IS YOUR YOUR PLAN

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:19.691
TO DO MORE TELEPHONIC AND-

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:23.662
PHONES AND- DEVICES IS THAT. AN

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:26.098
ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE.

00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:28.300
IN TERMS OF ACCESSING REMOTE

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:30.269
SERVICES YES WHAT WE SAW IS

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:32.070
THAT BEING ABLE TO PIVOT AND

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:33.438
PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.641
TECHNOLOGY WILL CERTAINLY ALLOW

00:19:35.707 --> 00:19:37.843
THEM TO- ONE CONTINUE TO BE

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.113
ENGAGED BUT ALSO- ENSURE THAT

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:43.415
WERE ABLE TO- GIVE THEM THE

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.317
TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY NEED TO

00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:46.051
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THEIR

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:47.553
REDETERMINATION RIGHT AND HAVE

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:51.056
ALL OF THOSE OTHER- ISSUES. AT

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:52.457
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AVAILABLE

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.693
TO THEM BUT- DEFINITELY OKAY

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.695
BUT BUT PEOPLE WON'T HAVE THOSE

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:58.330
DEVICES INTO THEIR ALREADY IN

00:19:58.397 --> 00:20:00.933
THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM CORRECT.

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:02.467
THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. SO WHAT

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:04.536
ARE WE DOING TODAY. BUT DO WE

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:05.704
HAVE ANYTHING IN PLACE SO WE'RE

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:06.805
ACTUALLY REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.473
WHO MAY NEED SERVICES OR THE

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.376
COUNTIES WORKING ON. THEY THEY

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:13.345
ARE AND I WILL SAY THAT JUST

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:14.680
HISTORICALLY IN CALIFORNIA WE

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:16.181
HAVE CERTAINLY TRIED TO BE MORE

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:18.550
PROACTIVE RIGHT. AND SO- PART

00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:19.885
OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:20.986
CELL ED PLATFORM IS REALLY

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.988
PROMOTING- IN ASSURING THAT

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:24.690
FOLKS ARE ABLE TO COME BACK

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:26.258
INTO THE COUNTY SYSTEM. AND

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:28.427
ACCESS ADDITIONAL SERVICES-

00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:29.661
THERE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN OTHER

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:31.396
PROACTIVE EFFORTS TO CONNECT

00:20:31.463 --> 00:20:33.398
AND SHARE INFORMATION. ABOUT

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:36.001
OPPORTUNITIES TO ENROLL IN- CAL

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:38.971
WORKS IN CALFRESH. THROUGH A

00:20:39.037 --> 00:20:40.038
PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE HAD

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:41.239
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF OUTREACH

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:44.276
AROUND- SORT OF EITC IN IN IN

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:46.878
ONGOING- SORT OF REACH WITH

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.046
COMMUNITY PARTNERS. TO ENSURE

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:50.682
THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO OUR

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:52.317
PROGRAMS AND UNDERSTAND THAT

00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:54.419
WERE THERE TO PROVIDE SERVICES

00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:56.488
DURING THE PANDEMIC. I THOUGHT

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:57.489
RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING BUT

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:58.590
THIS IS OFTENTIMES THE SAME

00:20:58.657 --> 00:20:59.758
DEMOGRAPHIC WERE BEING LEFT OUT

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.593
OF THE VACCINE ISSUE WHO HAVE

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.794
HIGHER RATES THAN ANYBODY ELSE

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.763
SO. IT'S VERY SENSITIVE TO IT

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.698
IF THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:07.265
THAT WE'RE NOT REACHING. AND

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:12.437
COULD BE. BUT ANYTHING. NOTHING

OTHER STATES- I GUESS WHAT I

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:28.720

COME UP- AND- GET. SERVICE

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.666
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE LONGEST

00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:42.200
ECONOMIC EVEN THOUGH SLOW

00:21:42.267 --> 00:21:43.001
EXPANSION ACT EXACTLY

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:45.003
EXPANSIONS IN US ONE THE

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.638
QUESTIONS I HAD FOR YOU IS THAT

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:48.407
WE DO PROVIDE A TIME LIMIT FOR

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:50.442
PEOPLE TO BE ON CAO WORKS RIGHT

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:51.977
AND THEN WE EXPECT THEM TO GET

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:53.645
OFF AND IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME

00:21:53.712 --> 00:21:55.247
WE TRY TO GET THEM EDUCATION

00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:56.581
ANOTHER TYPE THINGS GET A JOB

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:58.116
AND- POTENTIALLY THEY- WERE

00:21:58.183 --> 00:22:00.786
ABLE TO. HOPEFULLY SOME MANY OF

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:01.319
THEM WERE ABLE TO GET ONE

00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:04.523
DURING THE EXPANSION. THEN

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:06.158
COBIT HEADS. SOME DOUBT THEY

00:22:06.224 --> 00:22:07.893

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:11.930
UNEMPLOYMENT ARE SO FORTH BUT I

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:15.667
GUESS ARE YOU ABLE TO IDENTIFY-

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:18.537
FOR EXAMPLE WHAT HOW MANY

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:20.906
PEOPLE AND FORTY PRIME MANY OF

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:23.141
THEM WOMEN SOME WOMEN WHICH WE

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:25.077
KNOW HAVE HAD AT A MUCH IGHER

00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:26.812
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE

00:22:26.878 --> 00:22:28.380
RELEASED- CHALLENGES WITH WITH

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:32.350
COATED WITH EMPLOYMENT-

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:34.853
BASICALLY WOULD'VE LOST THE JOB

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.987
AFTER THEY'VE RUN OUT THEIR

00:22:36.054 --> 00:22:41.126
TIME AND THEN- AND THEN I

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:41.727
ASSUME THEY CAN'T COME BACK ON

00:22:41.793 --> 00:22:44.029
RIGHT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:48.834
I'M SAYING. I BELIEVE SO YEAH

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.801
AS OUR POLL OF THEIR PULL THE

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:51.970
PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO BASICALLY

00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:55.240
YOU KNOW WERE ON. OUR EXPO FOR

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:57.843
RAN UP THEIR TIME ARE WE ALMOST

00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:58.977
RAN OUT THERE TIME WE GOT THEM

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:01.079
TO A- DURING THE EXPANSION THIS

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:03.982
YEARS AGO NALCO IT HIT. THE JOB

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.151
THEY GOT THE GUN RIGHT THEY

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.687
FOUND A JOB IN HOSPITALITY

00:23:08.754 --> 00:23:10.655
FOUND JOB AND DELIVER AND THEN.

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:13.225
NOW THEIR STUCK RIGHT BY I

00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:14.426
ASSUME RIGHT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:15.994
COME BACK ON TO OUR X. THAT

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:20.432
CORRECT. THAT'S RIGHT. DO YOU

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:20.899
KNOW THE SIZE OF THAT

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:25.604
POPULATION. I'M PART OF THE BEN

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:26.304
HOWARD'S IS ADDED TO THEIR

00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:27.539
FAMILIES RIGHT SO CHILDREN

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:29.407
WOULD STILL REMAIN I'M SURE YOU

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:30.175
KNOW THEY WOULD STILL HAVE

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:32.310
ACCESS TO EIGHT RIGHT- AND IF

00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:33.612
THE CHILDREN ARE AN AGE THEY

00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:35.647
LIKELY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE SPUR

00:23:35.714 --> 00:23:37.015
OTHER PROGRAMS ADDRESS OFF

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.884
FRESH SO THERE THERE IS NOT

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.752
SUPPORT TO HELP ASSISTING

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:42.654
FAMILIES. DURING THIS TIME

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:44.022
SHOULD THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:46.358
THEIR THEIR LIFETIME ON KALKA

00:23:46.424 --> 00:23:48.260
BUT IT BUT BECAUSE THEY COULD

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:49.694
STILL GET SOME OTHER SERVICES

00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:51.463
IS THERE ANYWAY FOR AND AGAIN

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.064
AT IT SYSTEMS ARE UP TO IT TO

00:23:53.131 --> 00:23:56.334
IDENTIFY HOW LARGE THE POOL OF

00:23:56.401 --> 00:23:57.002
PEOPLE ARE. BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:23:57.068 --> 00:23:58.203
GETTING SOME SERVICES BUT THEY

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:58.970
COULDN'T GET THE OTHER ONES

00:23:59.037 --> 00:24:00.972
RIGHT SO BECAUSE THE QUOTE

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:01.973
DISQUALIFYING I I'M JUST TRY TO

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.976
GET A SENSE OF. HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:06.645
ARE SIR STUCK IN THAT. TRAP

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:09.648
RIGHT- SO I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE

00:24:09.714 --> 00:24:11.116
THAT QUESTION BACK TO IN TERMS

00:24:11.183 --> 00:24:13.952
OF THE DATA ANALYSIS PIECE. AND

00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:16.221
SEE YOU KNOW WHAT IS- WHAT IS

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:18.256
READILY AVAILABLE AND LOOK I

00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:19.024
SEE WHAT'S FEASIBLE SO WE CAN

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.292
WORK WITH YOUR STUFF. BUT I

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:22.260
THINK THE OTHER POINT I'D LIKE

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:23.428
TO MAKE IS THAT IF FOLKS ARE

00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:25.063
STILL ELIGIBLE IF THEY'RE STILL

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:27.232
ON THE PROGRAM. AND WE'VE BEEN

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.433
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OF THE

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.467
POSITIVE FORTY EIGHT MONTHS

00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:30.869
TIME CONTRACT IT WOULD IT WOULD

00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:32.003
STOP THEIR TIME RIGHT SO THEY

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.471
WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME.

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:35.674
UNTIL WE TRANSITION TO THE

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.076
SIXTY MONTH TIME. SO THERE IS-

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:39.311
THAT LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM FOR

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:40.679
THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:42.247
PERHAPS A TOWARDS THE END OF

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:44.082
THEIR THEIR TIME- DAY WOULD

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.250
STILL CONTINUE TO BE SEARCHED

00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.718
NO AND I APPRECIATE THAT I'M

00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:47.786
I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT PEOPLE

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:51.489
WHO- UNFORTUNATELY MIGHT

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:53.058
ACTUALLY- RAN OUT OF TIME

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:54.793
BEFORE COVERED BUT THEN. COVET

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.528
OF COURSE CHANGED. THEIR WHOLE

00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:58.797
CONSOLE. SITUATION RIGHT AROUND

00:24:58.864 --> 00:25:01.299
THEM SO. OKAY YEAH- ALL RIGHT

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:03.935
AND THEN. THE OTHER I GUESS THE

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:06.171
OTHER QUESTION IS THAT AND THEN

00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:09.307
THE RACE MENTIONED- MAYBE.

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:10.709
PERHAPS AND I DON'T KNOW AND

00:25:10.775 --> 00:25:12.110
REALIZE EDIE'S REALLY BUSY

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:13.245
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:14.646
OTHER THINGS WE NEED THEM TO DO

00:25:14.713 --> 00:25:16.982
RIGHT NOW- BUT- ARE WE

00:25:17.048 --> 00:25:19.317
EXPECTING PERHAPS TO SEE A- AND

00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:21.953
YOUR PROJECTIONS FOR- CASE

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.322
RATES- DO WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:27.859
MAY BE- RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:29.761
WHETHER THROUGH P. U. A. R. ET

00:25:29.828 --> 00:25:31.796
DE WHO THAT HIS OWN PLANE IS

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:33.531
ABOUT TO RUN OUT AND REASON WE

00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:35.033
HAVEN'T SEEN THEM. GO TO CAL

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.202
WORKS AND WIDER CASELOAD IS OUT

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:39.437
IS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T DID RUN

00:25:39.504 --> 00:25:40.538
OUT THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BUT

00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:41.439
THEY'RE RUNNING OUT THEIR

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:42.674
APPOINTMENT NOW OR JUST

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:44.609
RECENTLY R. VERY SHORTLY AND

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:45.744
THEN THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE A

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.178
SUDDEN INCREASE IN OUR CASE LED

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:50.548
BECAUSE JUST AGAIN IS THAT AN

00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:55.120
EXPLANATION WE LOOKED INTO. ALL

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:56.955
RIGHT- GREAT QUESTION SO WE

00:25:57.022 --> 00:25:58.456
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH EDT

00:25:58.523 --> 00:26:00.825
PRECISELY TO. SORT OF PARSE OUT

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.327
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.562
WE RECOGNIZE. THAT UNEMPLOYMENT

00:26:04.629 --> 00:26:06.231
IS LIKELY PUTTING INDIVIDUALS

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:07.632
OVER THE INCOME TO BE ELIGIBLE

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:09.367
FOR A PROGRAM RATE- SO THAT'S

00:26:09.434 --> 00:26:10.936
VERY REAL SO WE ARE WORKING

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:12.570
WITH THEM TO ENSURE THAT WE

00:26:12.637 --> 00:26:15.373
HAVE PROPER MESSAGING. AND AND

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.808
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO MAKE

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:18.310
SURE THAT FOLKS DON'T GET

00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:20.512
DROPPED. OR LOST RATE FROM

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:22.447
TRANSITIONING TO YOU WHY TO

00:26:22.514 --> 00:26:23.682
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE

00:26:23.748 --> 00:26:25.083
FOR TELEWORK CAL FRESHER ANY

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.252
OTHER. PROGRAMS WITHIN SOCIAL

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:29.688
SERVICES SO THAT WE ARE DOING-

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:30.922
I WOULD SAY THAT THE OTHER

00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:33.491
PIECE IS THAT YOU KNOW IN THE

00:26:33.558 --> 00:26:35.026
BIGGER PICTURE IS REALLY TO BE

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:36.094
WORKING ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:37.662
PROGRAMS. THAT'S YOUR EARLIER

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:38.697
POINT AROUND EMPLOYMENT AND

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:40.865
TRAINING WELL YES PERHAPS FOLKS

00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:42.133
HAVE DROPPED OFF FROM OUR

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.501
PARTICULAR PROGRAMS PERHAPS

00:26:43.568 --> 00:26:45.637
THEY'RE NOT- ACCESSING OUR

00:26:45.704 --> 00:26:48.840
WELFARE TO WORK BUT WE ARE

00:26:48.907 --> 00:26:49.975
STATE WORKFORCE SYSTEM. TO MAKE

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:51.543
SURE THAT THERE IS A CONTINUITY

00:26:51.609 --> 00:26:53.178
AND THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:54.746
WE'RE SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO

00:26:54.813 --> 00:26:55.880
TRANSITION FOLKS FROM OUR

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:57.682
PROGRAMS. INTO THEIR PROGRAM SO

00:26:57.749 --> 00:27:01.019
THAT IS HAPPENING- I CAN'T- YOU

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:03.221
KNOW- I CAN'T GIVE YOU NUMBERS

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:05.790
RIGHT NOW BUT- AGAIN IT IS

00:27:05.857 --> 00:27:06.925
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE MINDFUL

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:08.860
OF THAT'S A STRATEGY. OKAY BUT

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:11.096
IS A LONG TERM SO APPRECIATE

00:27:11.162 --> 00:27:12.897
YOU ARE DOING THAT WORK AND

00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:14.966
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. IS THAT

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:17.002
BUILT IN WHAT WERE THOSE THINGS

00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:18.837
BUILT IN INTO YOUR CASE RATE

00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:24.609
ASSUMPTIONS THAT- YOU THAT

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:25.143
YOU'RE PRESENTING FOR THE

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:29.614
BUDGET. SO IN TERMS OF OUR-

YOU WERE GOOD POINT IN TIME

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:35.887
BASED ON WHAT WE EXPECTED-

00:27:35.954 --> 00:27:37.522
THINKING THROUGH THAT FOLKS

00:27:37.589 --> 00:27:40.158
WOULD AGAIN AFTER UNEMPLOYMENT

00:27:40.225 --> 00:27:42.193
RAN OUT WOULD BE ABLE TO. SORT

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.229
OF TRANSITION INTO OUR OUR OUR

00:27:44.295 --> 00:27:46.531
CASELOAD SO THAT PART WAS BUILT

00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:47.665
INTO OKAY ALL RIGHT SO IT'S SO

00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:49.167
YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE IN DALLAS

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:51.369

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:54.572
SPEED PROJECTIONS THAT WE

00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:55.940
OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHAT. IT

00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:57.609
DEFINITELY HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE

00:27:57.675 --> 00:27:58.510
AND BUILT THAT THIS

00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:02.347
POSSIBILITY. THIS SCENARIO IN

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:02.914
FOR TRYING TO PROJECT CASE

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:05.316
RATES FOR. THIS NEXT STEP

BUDGET YEAR. YES ALTHOUGH IT

00:28:07.752 --> 00:28:09.054
WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.356
BECAUSE MANY OF THE SORT OF THE

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:12.457
BENEFITS IN THE RELIEF COMING

ME LIKE THERE'S NOT OUR SYSTEM

00:29:33.972 --> 00:29:35.640
IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO EACH

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:38.042
TRACK. OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:40.311
EXITED THE SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW

00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:42.780

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.653
IN TERMS OF OUR ACCENTS WE DO

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.589
HAVE- WHEN FOLKS EXIT THERE

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:55.527
NEEDS TO BE- SORT OF. ATTACKING

00:29:55.593 --> 00:29:57.095
IF YOU WELL IN THE DATA SYSTEM

00:29:57.162 --> 00:29:59.430
OF WHY THEY'RE EXITING AND SO

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:02.400
THE ITEMS THAT I CALLED OUT OR

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:04.536
TWO OF THE LARGEST DRIVERS-

00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:06.004
AGAIN AND WIND THAT PERHAPS

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.272
THEY WERE OVER INCOME SO

00:30:07.338 --> 00:30:09.207
EXCESSIVE INCOME AND THE SECOND

00:30:09.274 --> 00:30:12.210
BEING THAT- THEY WERE EXCLUDED-

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:13.745
BY LAW FOR REASONS OTHER THAN

00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:15.547
TIME LIMITS AND CITIZENSHIP

00:30:15.613 --> 00:30:16.214
RIGHT SO MAYBE THEY DON'T.

00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:18.249
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH- THERE WERE

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:19.284
DETERMINATION AND

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.819
REDETERMINATION ETCETERA SO-

00:30:21.886 --> 00:30:22.787
THOSE ARE THE TWO LARGEST

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:25.023
DRIVERS CONTRIBUTING TO THE

00:30:25.089 --> 00:30:28.660
EXIT. OKAY BUT SO DO YOU HAVE-

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:32.797
I MEAN IF SOMEONE. TRACKABLE

00:30:32.864 --> 00:30:36.267
AMOUNT I YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:38.102
AROUND OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:40.672
BUT I HINK- WE ALL HAVE THE

00:30:40.738 --> 00:30:42.507
SAME CONCERN WHICH IS WE WANT

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:43.074
TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE AREN'T

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:45.877
DROPPING OUT FOR REASONS THAT

00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:49.013
COULD BE AVOIDED. ZACKS THAT'S

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.482
WHAT I'M WONDERING IS IT. NO IS

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:53.384
THERE A WAY TO KIND OF KEEP

00:30:53.451 --> 00:30:54.085
TRACK OF THAT AND MAKE SURE

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:56.454
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IF IT'S NOT A

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:57.855
ONE OF THE KEY REASONS YOU KNOW

00:30:57.922 --> 00:30:59.090
THAT YOU MENTION THAT THEY HAVE

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:00.358
ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM WAS THERE

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:03.528
AND IS THERE ANOTHER- MEANS FOR

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:06.231
THEM TO. TO GET HELP THAT THEY

00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:07.632
AREN'T AWARE OF OR IS THERE

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:09.100
SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON YOU

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:11.803
KNOW AS TO WHY THEY'RE DROPPING

00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:17.775
OUT OF THE SYSTEM. YES YES SO-

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:19.510
THERE'S A FEW POSSIBLE.

00:31:19.577 --> 00:31:21.279
SCENARIOS AYE I WOULD SUGGEST

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:24.649
SO- AGAIN THIS WHOLE ISSUE-

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:27.385
PERHAPS- FAMILIES WOULD COME IN

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:28.953
IF THEY HAVE BEEN TIMED OUT.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.488
FAMILIES WOULD COME IN AND THEY

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:31.589
WOULD STILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE

00:31:31.656 --> 00:31:33.891
AID FOR THEIR CHILDREN- IN SOME

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:35.660
CASES WE HAVE YOU KNOW OUR HOME

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:36.761
VISITING PROGRAM RIGHT THAT

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:38.329
WE'RE PERHAPS. IF WE'RE ONLY

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:39.464
SERVING THE CHILDREN IN THE

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.267
FAMILY- THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS.

00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:44.035
TO OTHER SORT OF REFERRALS IN

00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:45.670
IN WAYS TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:47.238
SERVICES THAT THEY MAY NEED. SO

00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:48.973
THERE IS A STCK COMPONENT AS

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.910
WELL- BUT- AGAIN IF YOU WOULD

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:55.013
LIKE TO SEE MORE AROUND SORT OF

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:56.180
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE TIMED

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:57.548
OUT. WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THAT

00:31:57.615 --> 00:31:59.117
BACK AND ENSURE THAT DATA WITH

00:31:59.183 --> 00:32:00.618
YOU I JUST I DON'T HAVE THAT

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:03.021
AVAILABLE. AT THIS MOMENT. OKAY

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.088
IF YOU CAN DO THAT AT SOME

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.823
POINT AND YOU SHOULD ARE. IN

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.992
THE FIVE THOUSAND ANYTHING

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:08.860
YOU'RE DOING. THAT WE WOULD

00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:10.295
APPRECIATE THAT JUST JUST AS A

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.362
POINT OF REFERENCE FOR US THANK

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:16.200
YOU- THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NOW

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:19.537

YOU- I'M JUST JUST A BRING THIS

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:24.909
CONVERSATION BACK TO A HIGH

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:26.311
LEVEL WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CAL

00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:28.713
EXCUSE THOUGH RIGHT NOW AND-

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.517
WHY OUR OFFICE THINGS THAT. THE

00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:34.686
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS ABHORRENT

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:36.587
AND WORTHY OF FURTHER

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:39.324
EXPLORATION ALONG THESE LINES-

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.959
AS AS WE KNOW HOW WORKS OFFERS

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:44.195
IS HIS SENSE TO VERY LOW INCOME

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:46.764
FAMILIES AND FAMILY SO ENTER

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:48.866
THE PROGRAM ARE TYPICALLY. AT

00:32:48.933 --> 00:32:51.469
THE END OF THEIR ROPES- SO

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:52.570
WHILE WE HAVE SEEN

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.539
TRADITIONALLY THAT CASELOAD

00:32:54.605 --> 00:32:57.075
INCREASES IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:59.610
INCREASES ON UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH

00:32:59.677 --> 00:33:00.078
WOULD MAKE THE CURRENT

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:01.646
SITUATION WHERE THE CASELOAD IS

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:03.548
DECLINING DESPITE UNEMPLOYMENT

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:05.316
UNUSUAL IT'S NOT TRADITIONALLY

00:33:05.383 --> 00:33:07.352
BECAUSE FAMILIES COME

00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:09.287
IMMEDIATELY TO CAL WORKS. OF

00:33:09.354 --> 00:33:11.222
FROM LOSING THEIR JOB AND IN

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:14.258
FACT EVEN IN IN- TYPICAL

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:15.993
SITUATION WHERE A FAMILY IS

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.563
JUST RUNNING THEIR BASE- YOU I

00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:20.898
BENEFIT THAT WOULD TYPICALLY BE

00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:21.933
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD BE

00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:23.501
NOT INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:25.870
PROGRAM. WHAT WE FIND IS

00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:31.809
INSTEAD WHEN THERE IS A COURT.

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:32.410
LABOR MARKET AS THEREIS RIGHT

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:33.611
NOW. FOR JUST LESS LIKE TO FALL.

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:36.080
A JOB ONCE THEY'VE EXHAUSTED

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:37.815
YOU LIVE ONCE THEY'VE EXHAUSTED

00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:39.217
THE RESOURCES OF THEIR FRIENDS

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:40.985
AND FAMILIES AND THEY'RE ALSO

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:42.787
LESS LIKELY TO FIND A JOB IF

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:43.621
THEY'RE ALREADY ON THE CAL

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.256
WORKS CASE THOUGH SO WE WOULD

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:47.592
EXPECT TO SEE. RELATIVELY FEW

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:49.961
ACCIDENTS DURING A TIME SUCH AS

00:33:50.027 --> 00:33:53.030
THIS WHAT IS UNUSUAL ABOUT

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:55.867
RIGHT NOW ARE THESE THREE

00:33:55.933 --> 00:33:59.003
FACTORS ADDED TOGETHER ONE THAT

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.805
APPLICATIONS ARE ANALYST WORK

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:02.673
WITH LOW LEVEL FOR THIS.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.843
PROGRAM TO THAT AMONG THOSE

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:06.844
APPLICATIONS THAT ARE BEING

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:08.613
SUBMITTED THEY ARE BEING DENIED

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:11.482
IT AND I'M USUALLY A HIGH RATE

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:13.518
IS FOR HISTORICALLY AS WAS

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:16.821
MENTIONED BEFORE 60% AS OPPOSED

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:19.357
TO AROUND 48% AND NUMBER THREE

00:34:19.424 --> 00:34:21.459
THAT EXITS ARE AT IT

00:34:21.526 --> 00:34:23.060
HISTORICALLY HIGH RATE DESPITE

00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:23.861
THE FACT THAT WE DON'T

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:26.130
ANTICIPATE MANY OF THESE

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:26.697
FAMILIES ARE LEAVING BECAUSE

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:30.134
THEY FOUND. EMPLOYMENT AND THE

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:31.169
FACT THAT THEY WERE ON THE

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:32.870
PROGRAM SUGGESTS THAT THEY

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:34.739
PROBABLY DID NOT HAVE A CLOSE

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:35.773
ENOUGH CONNECTION TO THE LABOR

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.809
MARKET BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THAT

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:39.310
THEY WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR

00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:41.212
UNEMPLOYMENT. SO IT IS RATHER

00:34:41.279 --> 00:34:45.216
MYSTERIOUS- JUST WHY THESE

00:34:45.283 --> 00:34:45.783
THREE FACTORS ARE HAPPENING

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.920
RIGHT NOW. WE DO IN OUR IN OUR

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:52.256
MOST RECENT POST ON THIS GO-

00:34:52.323 --> 00:34:54.225
MAKE SOME EFFORTS TO ANSWER

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:55.226
THESE QUESTIONS LOOKING AT THE

00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:56.527
DATA THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW BUT

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:57.895
WE THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:34:57.962 --> 00:34:59.897
OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS. WE THANK

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:01.833
THE DEPARTMENT FOR OFFERING THE

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:03.935
SOME FURTHER INSIGHT TODAY BUT

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.203
WE THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:06.604
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GRAPPLE

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.406
WITH EVEN MORE IN CONTINUE

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:09.907
ASKING THIS QUESTIONS AND

00:35:09.974 --> 00:35:10.808
CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:12.543
DEPARTMENT. WITH OUR PARTNERS

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.578
AND OTHER STATES AND WITH OTHER

00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:15.980
STAKEHOLDERS OF FOR THE MONTHS

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:17.348
AHEAD. ABSOLUTELY I THINK

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:18.416
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE SEE THE

00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:19.784
INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:20.918
PEOPLE USING FOOD BANKS AND

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:22.186
OTHER KIND OF RESOURCES LIKE

00:35:22.253 --> 00:35:23.821
THAT WE KNOW WE KNOW POVERTY IS

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:25.723
NOT POVERTY IS INCREASING. AND

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.558
YET THE POOREST OF THE POOR ARE

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:28.125

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:38.002
A. AS PRESENTATION- DOES THE

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:40.037
OTHER HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS AS

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:42.907
TO- AND I KNOW THAT THE FARMS

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:44.175
OR SERVICE SEVENTIES OFFER TO

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:46.210
LOOK AT SOME THINGS- SOME

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:48.246
DIRECTION THAT TO TRY TO FIGURE

00:35:48.312 --> 00:35:50.314
OUT THE ANSWER TO SOME OF THESE

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:51.082
QUESTIONS AND- WE TRIED

00:35:51.148 --> 00:35:53.885
ENQUIRING I APPRECIATE YOUR

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:55.987
BACKGROUND. WE NOW IN MAY ARE

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:57.221
THERE THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING

00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:59.090
TO TRY TO FERRET OUT THE

00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:01.125
ANSWERS TO THIS MYSTERY THIS

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:02.493
THREE WAY MYSTERY ACTUALLY AS

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.662
TO WHY THIS IS ALL RUNNING

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:08.900
COUNTERING TO WHAT WE EXPECT.

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:11.903
YEAH OKAY YES- IS A GREAT

00:36:11.969 --> 00:36:13.871
QUESTION I THINK. UNFORTUNATELY

00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:14.972
WE'RE NOT AT THE POINT WHERE WE

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:16.974
HAVE SOLID RECOMMENDATIONS BUT

00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:19.644
I DO THINK THAT- WE HAVE SOME

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.147
USEFUL OBSERVATIONS. FIRST

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:28.553
DATE. OF INCREASE IN ACCIDENTS-

00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:31.322
IS TO BE A IN PART DRIVEN BY A

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:33.057
FAILURE TO COMPLETE PAPERWORK

00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:35.192
AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE OR TO

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:38.663
NOT I COMPLETED CORRECTLY- IF

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.598
YOU COMBINE THIS WITH THIS

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:41.999
OBSERVATION THAT IN THE SPRING

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:44.335
WE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED BE

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:46.470
DETERMINATIONS AND THAT. THAT

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:48.072
TEMPORARY SUSPENSION ACTUALLY

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:51.409
RESULT IN END THE ONLY-

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:52.677
INCREASE IN THE CASE OF THAT

00:36:52.743 --> 00:36:55.012
WE'VE EXPERIENCED DURING. THE

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.914
PANDEMIC THAT WAS BECAUSE

00:36:56.981 --> 00:36:58.416
VIRTUALLY NO ONE EXITED THIS

00:36:58.482 --> 00:36:59.817
PROGRAM AS LONG AS WE WORK

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:01.686
REQUIRING THAT THEY SUBMIT THIS

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.487
REGULAR PAPERWORK IT DOES

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:05.189
SUGGEST THAT ONE POSSIBLE

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:06.557
OPTION HERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:09.160
ALONG THOSE LINES OF ANOTHER

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:09.560
SUSPENSION OR PRE

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:11.562
DETERMINATIONS. NOW WE'RE NOT

00:37:11.629 --> 00:37:12.630
QUITE AT THE POINT OF MAKING

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:15.666
THAT RECOMMENDATION- NOT ONLY

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:17.735
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A FULL

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:19.203
ANSWER TO THIS MYSTERY BUT ALSO

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.138
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT JUST AGREE

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:22.640
AND LEGALLY COMPLICATED

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:25.009
UNFORTUNATELY THIS RETURN

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:27.044
NATION PAPERWORK IS LINKED TO

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:28.412
THAT ACCOUNT FRESH WHICH HAS

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:32.383
FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. SO WITH

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:33.417
WITHOUT HAVING A FEDERAL WAIVER

00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:35.319
THE CALFRESH SIDE IT MIGHT BE

00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:37.254
COMPLICATED SAID THINK ABOUT

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:38.889
HOW YOU DECOUPLE BUT THAT WOULD

00:37:38.956 --> 00:37:42.326
BE ONE. A POSSIBLE OPTION WE

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:44.095
ALSO THINK EXPLORING ADDITIONAL

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:46.564
AREAS WHERE. IN PERSON

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:49.634
REQUIREMENTS OR OR SOMETHING OR

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.701
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:52.003
SOMETHING- DEBTS IN THE

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:54.005
APPLICATION OR ELIGIBILITY

00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:56.140
DETERMINATION PROCESS THAT

00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:57.108
MIGHT BE PARTICULARLY

00:37:57.174 --> 00:37:58.676
COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF PUBLIC

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:00.578
HEALTH CONCERNS RIGHT NOW THIS

00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:01.312
IMPORTANT WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:04.115
DEPARTMENTS. CURRENTLY CRAFTING

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:06.417
OF FURTHER GUIDANCE ON IN

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:08.352
PERSON PHOTO ID REQUIREMENTS

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:09.854
FOR THAT WE THINK THAT'S THAT'S

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.422
AN IMPORTANT STEP IN FURTHER

00:38:11.489 --> 00:38:13.290
IDENTIFYING ANYTHING ALONG

00:38:13.357 --> 00:38:15.426
THOSE LINES- AND OTHER THINGS

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:17.161
WE COULD LOOK AT BE. FOR

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:22.199
EXAMPLE EXEMPTING- YOU WIPE

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:23.834
BENEFITS OR ANY FEDERAL. EIGHT

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:24.602
BENEFITS FROM INCOME

00:38:24.669 --> 00:38:26.237
CALCULATIONS JUST MAKING A

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:28.205
CLEAR LINE THAT THOSE WOULD NOT

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:30.641
RENDER ANYONE IS INELIGIBLE

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:31.976
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:34.011
ALSO WORTH LOOKING INTO. OKAY

00:38:34.078 --> 00:38:34.979

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:02.139
DO- TO ENSURE THAT ELIGIBLE

DURING THIS CRISIS- SOME SORT

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:09.613
OF GOING BACK TO MARCH OF LAST

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.615
YEAR ACROSS OUR PROGRAMS WE

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:14.251

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:52.028
NUMBERS. WHEN COMPARING

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:54.263
SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TO

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.765
AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY THE

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:57.567
CHANGING CALIFORNIA WAS POINT

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:58.834
4% IN OUR CASE OR IN THE

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:01.537
NATIONAL AVERAGE WAS 1% SO NOT

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.306
FAR BEHIND THAT NATIONAL

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:04.607
AVERAGE JUST ON THESE VERY

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.042
PRELIMINARY NUMBERS WHICH WE

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:08.311
KEEP AN EYE ON- TO MAKE SURE

01:04:08.377 --> 01:04:10.079
THAT- WHAT KIND OF

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:11.247
UNDERSTANDING THAT. THAT

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:13.015
NATIONAL TREND AND THAT WOULD

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:15.718
BE THE BEST AVAILABLE RIGHT IN

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:17.320
THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC OKAY.

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:19.055
I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER HAS

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.289
ALSO APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGES

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.958
AND WE HAVE TAKEN MANY STEPS TO

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:23.292
ACTUALLY MAKE CALFRESH MORE

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.194
AVAILABLE TO LARGER POPULATIONS

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.230
HE'S POINTED OUT WITH FAMILY

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:27.863
AND IT'S ABLE TO MAKE IT

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.366
AVAILABLE TO- PEOPLE ON SSI AND

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.935
SO FORTH SO- MAYBE IT SPEAKS TO

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:35.338
A- OF. AND AGAIN IT WOULD BE A

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.773
STATE ONLY BUT- PERHAPS THE

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.941
NATIONAL EFFORT TO FIND WAYS TO

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:41.077
GET. SOME BETTER DATA MORE

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:43.179
UPDATED AT TWO TWO PLUS YEAR

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:47.817
LOOK BACK. AT TO FIGURE OUT

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:48.851
WHERE WE'RE STANDING THANK YOU.

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:50.419
AND JUST TO VISIT ONE MORE TIME

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:52.788
THE ISSUE AROUND FOOD BANKS AND

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:54.090
WE KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN SUCH AN

01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:55.725
INCREASE IN OUR FOOD BANK SO WE

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:56.892
KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY OUT

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:58.261
THERE. WE HAVE LOWER RATES OF

01:04:58.327 --> 01:05:00.096
PEOPLE UP ON CALFRESH SO

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:02.565
THERE'S A THERE'S A DISCONNECT

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:03.165
IN THERE SOMEWHERE THAT WE'VE

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:06.669
GOT TO BE ABLE TO TOUCH. THANK

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:17.113

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:24.520
L. L. NO THANK YOU OKAY NOTHING

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:26.622
ELSE NOT DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.658
THINK FOR THAT THANK YOU OKAY

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:30.326
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WANT

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:34.030
ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. OKAY SO I

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:36.766
WILL TAKE THAT ONE AS WELL. SO

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:38.601
AS DESCRIBED IN OUR HEARING

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:41.137
AGENDA- AND THIS IS RELATED TO

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:42.371
THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:43.839
BENEFITS AND TRANSITION

01:05:43.906 --> 01:05:46.642
NUTRITION BENEFIT PROGRAMS-

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:49.879
THESE TWO PROGRAMS SNB AND TMB

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:51.981
FOR SHORT WERE IMPLEMENTED WITH

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:53.683
THE EXPANSION OF CALFRESH TO

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:55.751
SSI RECIPIENTS. THEY WERE

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:57.653
INTENDED TO MITIGATE THE HARM

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.055
OF THEPOLICY CHANGE ON

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:01.223
EXISTING CALFRESH HOUSEHOLDS

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.025
WHO WHEN THE CHANGE WAS

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:05.728
IMPLEMENTED EITHER AT. A LOSS

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.931
IN CALFRESH BENEFITS OR BECAME

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:11.534
AN ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.836
BENEFITS. SO BENEFITS FROM BOTH

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:16.605
THE SMB AND TMB PROGRAMS ARE

01:06:16.672 --> 01:06:19.575
ISSUED BASED ON A BENEFIT TABLE

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.143
AND ORIGINALLY THAT BENEFIT

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:23.279
TABLE WAS BASED ARE USING IT

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:25.214
STILL IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:27.817
SSR RECIPIENTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:30.653
AT THE TIME THAT THE POLICY

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.488
CHANGE WAS IMPLEMENTED. SO THE

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:35.424
PROPOSAL TO UPDATE THE SMB AND

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:37.993
TMB BENEFIT TABLES ARE WERE

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.363
CALCULATED USING DATA FOR ON

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:42.231
ARTS SARS OR STATEWIDE

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:44.533
AUTOMATED RECONCILIATION SYSTEM

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.335
PAIN MOUTHFUL THAT IT'S OUR

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:48.637
ACTUAL EDT DATA. AND SO WHAT WE

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:51.774
DID IS WE ANALYZE EACH CATEGORY

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.109
IN THE BENEFIT TABLE. HE AND

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.778
POST THE EXPANSION OF CALFRESH

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.246
TO DETERMINE IF WE HAD BEEN

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:59.949
CHIEF OUR INTENDED GOAL. OF

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:01.684
THEM WE BALANCE EACH CATEGORY

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:04.453
INDIVIDUALLY SO AT LEAST 50% OF

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.090
RECIPIENTS X. THAT- EXPERIENCED

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:10.059
EITHER NO CHANGE OR INCREASE IN

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:12.328
BENEFITS WHEN YOU COMBINE THEIR

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.864
PREVIOUS CALFRESH AND SMB OR

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:19.335
THEIR NEW TMB- BENEFITS. SO

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:22.371
THAT THE 50% THRESHOLD ALL ADD

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:24.807
IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:26.275
OF MITIGATING THE LOSS OF

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:28.944
BENEFITS FOR THE CASELOAD AND

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:31.447
SO THESE BENEFITS UPDATES- PART

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:33.449
TO. GET MORE ACCURATE IF YOU

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:35.184
WILL WITH THE LOSS OF

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:37.086
CALIFORNIA SHE- THAT HAPPENED

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.220
AT THE TIME OF THE POLICY

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:40.589
CHANGE AND I'M GONNA STOP HERE

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:41.190
BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THAT WAS

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:44.026
QUITE COMPLICATED I'LL MISS IT

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:46.829
THERE ANY QUESTIONS. I WOULD

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.197
JUST COMIDAS ON WHO'S INVOLVED

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:51.367
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS-

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:51.901
THOSE ARE TWO PRETTY GOOD

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:55.604
EXPLANATION THANK. OKAY PLEASE

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:59.341
CONTINUE OKAY SO WITH REGARD TO

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:01.844
THE REPLACEMENT OF SM BEER TMB

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.447
BENEFITS- WOULDN'T FOOD THAT IS

01:08:04.513 --> 01:08:05.748
PURCHASED WITH THOSE BENEFITS

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:08.017
IS LOST YOU KNOW WHAT WE REFER

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.952
TO AS A HOUSEHOLD MISFORTUNE SO

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:11.187
THIS IS SOMETHING SUCH AS A

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:12.455
NATURAL DISASTER OR A

01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:13.889
REFRIGERATOR BREAKING DOWN

01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:16.392
UNEXPECTEDLY. SO WE DON'T HAVE

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:18.594
A CURRENTLY A PROPOSAL RELATED

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:20.296
TO REPLACING AS A BEER TMB

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.131
BENEFITS THAT SAID I WANT TO

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:23.966
PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.167
ISSUE AND HIGHLIGHT

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.001
CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:28.204
LEGISLATURE IS SUCH A PROPOSAL

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.506
WERE UNDER CONSIDERATION. FOR

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.608
REGULAR CAL FRESH AT THE

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:35.110
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL- THE BENEFIT

01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:37.112
REPLACEMENT AMOUNT WHEN THERE

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:39.515
IS A HOUSEHOLD MISFORTUNE IS

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:41.317
DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:44.687
FOOD- THAT WAS REPORTED AS LOST

01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:46.322
WHETHER THAT FOOD WAS A

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:49.992
PERISHABLE OR NON PERISHABLE-

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:50.826
AND WHAT TYPE OF HOUSEHOLD

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:52.328
MISFORTUNE IT WAS SO FOR

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:54.497
EXAMPLE IF YOUR FRIDGE BREAKS

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:55.798
WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.199
PERISHABLE FOODS IF YOU'VE

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:59.235
EXPERIENCED A FLOOD WE'RE GOING

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.202
TO REPLACE ALL OF THE FOOD

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:02.037
PURCHASED IT ALSO DEPENDS ON

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:04.106
THE TIME OF THE MONTH. BECAUSE

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:05.674
WE MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS AROUND

01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:06.942
HOW MUCH FOOD WOULD BE LEFT

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.744
AVAILABLE TO YOU- AT THE

01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:12.381
BEGINNING. OF THE MONTH VERSES

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:13.015
AT THE END OF THE MONTH. WE ALL

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:15.184
WORK BENEFITS CALFRESH BOTTOM.

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:16.619
SO THIS AMOUNT IS BASED ON THE

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.988
TYPE OF DISASTER AND THE TYPE

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:22.191
OF- THAT WAS LOST IN THE TIME

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:23.993
OF THE MONTH SO VERY SIMILAR.

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:26.428
WE REPLACE BENEFITS ON AN

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.597
AUTOMATIC BASIS. USING A

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:32.134
PERCENTAGE FORMULA SO IF UP A

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:33.402
MAJORITY OF HOUSEHOLDS IN AN

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:35.170
AREA ACCOUNT TO YEARS OF CODE

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:37.673
EXPERIENCE HOUSEHOLD MISFORTUNE

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.675
THAT LED TO ASSUME FOOD LOSS

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.143
SUCH AS AN EXTENDED POWER

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:42.611
OUTAGE. THEN WE'RE ABLE TO

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:44.446
AUTOMATICALLY REPLACE FOOD AT A

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:49.018
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE. 100% OF

01:09:49.084 --> 01:09:51.620
YOUR BENEFIT TOTAL. SO WHEN WE

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:53.255
ARE REPLACING BENEFITS AT THE

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:54.924
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WE MUST

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:56.859
RECEIVE AT THE COUNTY A REQUEST

01:09:56.926 --> 01:09:58.260
FOR REPLACEMENT USUALLY

01:09:58.327 --> 01:10:01.263
HOUSEHOLDS HAVE TEN DAYS TO DO

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.064
THAT WE OFTEN EXTENDED TO

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:04.800
THIRTY DAYS- WE THEN ISSUE THE

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:06.168
REPLACEMENT AMOUNT BASED ON

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:08.637
THAT DETERMINATION. AND WE MUST

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.139
BE ABLE TO REPORT THESE

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:12.641
BENEFITS SEPARATELY FROM

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.244
REGULAR CALFRESH. WHEN WE

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:16.111
REPLACE BENEFITS

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:17.646
PROBLEMATICALLY WE DO THAT BY

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:18.948
WORKING WITH OUR SAWS

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:21.350
ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM AGAIN WE

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:23.018
USUALLY USE A PERCENTAGE BASED

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:25.054
FORMULA AND THEY RUN A PROCESS

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.056
OVERNIGHT AND YOU SHOULD THE

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:29.124
REPLACEMENTS ALL AT ONCE. THE

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:30.693
REPLACEMENT IS USUALLY

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:33.796
SCHEDULED AGAINST OTHER CHANGES

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:36.332
OR- CROSS THE SEAS THAT ARE

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:37.800
HAPPENING IN OUR ELIGIBILITY

01:10:37.866 --> 01:10:39.234
SYSTEM SO WE SCHEDULE IT BASED

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:40.502
ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:42.671
SYSTEM AND JUST LIKE WHEN WE

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.039
REPLACE THEM INDIVIDUALLY WE

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:45.374
MUST BE ABLE TO TRACK THEM

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:47.943
SEPARATELY THEN REGULAR CAL

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:51.246
FRESH. BENEFITS THE- YOU CAN

01:10:51.313 --> 01:10:52.915
SEE THAT THERE IS BOTH MANUAL

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:54.550
WORK AND AUTOMATED WORK

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:55.484
INVOLVED WITH ISSUING

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.186
REPLACEMENTS DEPENDING ON HOW

01:10:57.252 --> 01:11:00.255
THAT HAPPENS SO IT WOULD

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:02.291
REQUIRE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN IN

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:03.425
THE S. N. B. N. T. N. B.

01:11:03.492 --> 01:11:04.927
PROGRAMS FOR OUR SYSTEM

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:06.662
AUTOMATION TO BE UPDATED AS

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:08.464
WELL SO THAT WE CAN ISSUE THOSE

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.466
REPLACEMENT BENEFITS AND KEEP

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:12.401
THEM SEPARATE AND APART FROM

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:15.371
YOUR REGULAR S. N. B. OR T. M.

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:18.007
B. BENEFITS. RIPARIAN

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:20.109
OPERATIONAL SIMPLICITY. I WOULD

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:21.110
ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:23.045
REPLACEMENT PROCESS NEARER THE

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.913

ELIGIBILITY AFTER IMPLEMENTING.

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:21.483
THE EXPANSION OF CALFRESH. SO

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:23.619
THAT CASE FOLLOWS WITH CALFRESH

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:25.220
TRENDS AND IT WOULD BE QUITE

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:27.356
CHALLENGING TO SEPARATE SMD

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:29.124
PARTICIPATION FROM CALFRESH

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:30.626
ENROLLMENT AS THAT WAS KIND OF

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:32.895
A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF OUR

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:35.464
IMPLEMENTATION. AB AND ALSO

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:36.798
HIGHLIGHT AS WE GET TO A COUPLE

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:38.133
OTHER QUESTIONS YOUR THEREIS

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.003
NO UNIQUE. RECERTIFICATION OR

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:42.104
BENEFIT MAINTENANCE

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:43.739
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SMB

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:45.841

WORK AT AN SMB HOUSEHOLD YOU'RE

ELIGIBLE TO MAINTAIN SMB. THE

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:54.750
TMB OKAY SO IT IS QUITE

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:56.885

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:59.621
PER TMB POLICY- TìM BEAT

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:01.823
BENEFITS WERE ISSUED TO FORMER

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.725
CALFRESH HOUSEHOLDS WHO LOST

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:05.928
ELIGIBILITY AFTER IMPLEMENTING

01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:08.697
THE EXPANSION. SO TMB HOUSEHOLD

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:10.232
WERE INITIALLY REQUIRED TO

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:13.568
RECERTIFY THEIR TMB AT TWELVE

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:15.237
MONTHS AFTER THAT KIND OF

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:16.405
EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE POLICY

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:18.340
CHANGE AND SO WHAT YOU'RE

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.142
SEEING IN THE DATA IS THAT AS

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:21.877
WE HAD THAT TWELVE MONTH MARK

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:24.179
WE DID START TO SEE. A DECLINE

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:27.449
IN THE CASELOAD AND- THERE ARE

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:29.217
REQUIRED TO RECERTIFY EVERY SIX

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:31.486
MONTHS THEREAFTER SO THAT THAT

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:34.256
DECLINE HAS CONTINUED. THE TMB

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:35.624
RESEARCH AND JUST TELL YOU A

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:37.025
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS TO

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:39.361
UNDERSTAND- HOW THAT MIGHT

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.563
IMPACT BENEFIT MAINTENANCE IS A

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:44.199
TWO PAGE RECERTIFICATION FORM

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:46.268
AND SO TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:47.769
HOUSEHOLDS ARE REQUIRED SHOULD

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:49.171
CONFIRM WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:50.305
ANY CHANGES IN THEIR

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:52.374
CIRCUMSTANCES. IF CHANGES ARE

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:54.676
REPORTED SO FOR EXAMPLE I THINK

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:56.979
RECENT INCOME FOR A CHANGE OF

01:16:57.045 --> 01:16:59.915
THE ORIGINAL SSI RECIPIENTS WHO

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:00.682
MAY NOT BE PART OF THE

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:02.384
HOUSEHOLD THEY MUST APPLY FOR

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:07.055
CALFRESH THAT IS. PART OF OUR

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:08.523
TEAM BE POLICY. IF THEY'RE NOT

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:10.425
ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH THEY CAN

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:15.731
STATE ON TMB- IF THEY CHANGED-

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:17.432
HAS- RESULTED IN THE ORIGINAL

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:19.668
SSI RECIPIENTS LEADING THEY

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:23.538
WILL- FINANCIALLY SEE KIND OF A

01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:25.474
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH CHANGE THAT

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.208
THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:30.045
FOR CALFRESH. AND THEN- LASTLY

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:31.680
THERE ARE A GROUP OF PEOPLE

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:33.448
UNKNOWN AT THIS NUMBER WERE

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:35.350
CONDUCTING MORE ANALYSIS ON

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:37.152
THIS WHO MAY NOT HAVE COMPLETED

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:39.321
THE RECERTIFICATION- AT ALL

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:41.523
AND- THEY HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:43.291
RETURN TO THE PROGRAM ONCE OR

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:44.926
BENEFITS FOR DISCONTINUED OR

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:48.196
THEY WILL HAVE A LOS TMB

01:17:48.263 --> 01:17:51.700
ELIGIBILITY I PERMANENTLY. AND

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:53.468
NOT WITH THE RECERTIFICATION IS

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:54.569
TWO PAGES RECEPTORS YOU SAID

01:17:54.636 --> 01:17:55.470
THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE ARE FALLING

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:56.371
OFF WHEN THEY HAVE TO BE

01:17:56.438 --> 01:18:00.108
CERTIFIED. YES WE MADE IT AS-

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:03.145
SIMPLE AS WE COULD- WITH IN

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:04.379
KIND OF THE PARAMETERS THAT

WERE SET FOR US IN IN CODE AT

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:08.150
THE TIME WE IMPLEMENTED AND SO

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:10.719
IT IS IT TOO PAGE FORM WITH

01:18:10.786 --> 01:18:12.054

AND THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THAT

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:17.292
BY PHONE AT THIS POINT. SO WE

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.261
DO ALLOW. IT TO BE SIGNED

01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:20.996
ELECTRONICALLY SO IF A CLIENT

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:22.964
WERE TO CALL IN. THE COUNTY

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.666

PEOPLE HAVING TO GO TO THE

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:39.915
COUNTY OFFICE. I'M FEELING VERY

01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:41.850
UNSAFE DURING THIS TIME. RIGHT

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:44.219
NOW YES ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW WE

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:45.287

IMPORTANT FIGURE IN FOR THIS.

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:55.743
WHICH I SHARED EARLIER IS THAT

ADDRESSING THIS DECLINE AND

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:11.926
EXPANDING AND PRESERVING THE

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:13.961
LADIES A THIRD FFI AFTER THE

01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:20.968
POPULATION. WITH HIGHER LEVEL

01:37:21.035 --> 01:37:24.538
OF CARE HE- REALLY SEEMS. IF I

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:30.477
CAN ASK YEAH HAVE WE- THANK

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:32.479
HAVE WE HOW MANY BEDS ARE STILL

01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:37.585

01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:38.219
FIFTY ONE HUNDRED. THAT WE HAVE

01:37:38.285 --> 01:37:40.487
THAT WE HAVE. AND WE'VE SEEN A

01:37:40.554 --> 01:37:41.589
DECLINE IN THE AMOUNT OF

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:44.892
EXERCISE PEOPLE IN THOSE BEDS.

01:37:44.959 --> 01:37:45.726
HAVE WE SEEN A DECLINE IN THE

01:37:45.793 --> 01:37:46.860
AMOUNT OF BEDS OR JUST THE

01:37:46.927 --> 01:37:48.629
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:49.463
ESSENCE I S. S. P. IN THOSE

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:53.434
BETS. QUESTION SO WE DON'T HAVE

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:54.969
OCCUPANCY DATA FOR THESE

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:59.139
FACILITIES. BUT WE CAN TRACK

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:00.874
THE NUMBER SS I RECIPIENTS MOST

01:38:00.941 --> 01:38:02.376
FACILITIES BUT THAT DOESN'T

01:38:02.443 --> 01:38:03.844
MEAN THAT THE CENSUS IS GOING

01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:05.546
DOWN AND- IT JUST MEANS THAT

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:09.516
THE NUMBER SS IRIS. CORRECT SO

01:38:09.583 --> 01:38:11.619
I THE WOULD NOT LEAD US TO

01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:12.920
BELIEVE THAT AND ONE OF THE

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:15.823
COMPLAINT I'VE HEARD. SINCE I

01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:16.857
WAS AT A DIRECT SERVICE

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:18.525
PROVIDER WAS THE LOW

01:38:18.592 --> 01:38:21.161
REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR SS

01:38:21.228 --> 01:38:22.830
SINUSES P. FOR RESIDENTIAL CARE.

01:38:22.896 --> 01:38:26.000
SO IT DOES INCREASING MORE BEDS

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:28.335
ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF. BUT

01:38:28.402 --> 01:38:29.370
PEOPLENOT BEING ABLE TO STAY

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:31.105
IN FACILITIES BECAUSE THE

01:38:31.171 --> 01:38:32.373
FACILITIES CAN'T MAKE IT ON THE

01:38:32.439 --> 01:38:34.308
RATE OF INCREASE IN PERSON.

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:36.143
YEAH SO THE INTENT OF THIS

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:39.013
PROPOSAL IS TO INCENTIVIZE.

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:41.582
THESE OPERATORS TO ACCEPT SSI

01:38:41.649 --> 01:38:43.384
PARTICIPANTS AS A SITE

01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:45.719
RECIPIENTS- INTO THEIR SETTINGS

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:47.621
I'M DOING SO BOTH THROUGH

01:38:47.688 --> 01:38:49.857
ACQUISITION AND WE HAD FUNDING

01:38:49.923 --> 01:38:51.959
BUT ALSO THROUGH LEVERAGING.

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:53.661
INVESTMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:38:53.727 --> 01:38:55.029
BUT I GOT THROUGH COUNTY

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:57.398
GOVERNMENT- ANISH CARE CLANS

01:38:57.464 --> 01:38:59.500
AND OTHERS WHO CAN PROVIDE OF

01:38:59.566 --> 01:39:01.869
THOSE AUXILIARY SERVICES IN

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:04.038
SETTINGS- WHICH AND IN SOME

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:05.539
CASES IT'S VERY DIRECT FUNDING

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:07.274
TO THE FACILITIES. AND IN SOME

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:09.910
CASES IT'S A PROVISION OF. IN

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:13.080
KIND SERVICES OR CALL LOCATING-

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:15.215
OTHER STAFF ON SITE TO. WORK

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:19.953
THE UNIQUE. NEEDS OF THIS

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:20.788
POPULATION. AND WE THINK

01:39:20.854 --> 01:39:21.388
HUNDRED MILLION IS GOING TO DO

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:25.893
IT FOR THIS OF CALIFORNIA. HOW

01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:30.264
MANY WITH THAT KNOW. HOW DO WE

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:33.867
COME UP WITH THAT NUMBER. SO

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:36.370
AGAIN IT WILL BE IT IS A LITTLE

01:39:36.437 --> 01:39:37.538
HARD TO PREDICT AT THIS POINT

01:39:37.604 --> 01:39:38.939
THE EXACT NUMBER OF FACILITIES

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:40.541
THAT WE CAN START WITH FEES

01:39:40.607 --> 01:39:42.376
FINES AND BECAUSE OF COURSE

01:39:42.443 --> 01:39:44.244
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CREATING

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:45.579
NEW FACILITIES WHICH IS IN MANY

01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:47.381
WAYS WILL WORK. ON AND TRY TO

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:49.950
DO HERE IS CREATE NET NEW

01:39:50.017 --> 01:39:51.885
RESOURCES- BECAUSE THEY'RE SO

01:39:51.952 --> 01:39:54.254
VALUABLE UT AGAIN ALSO HAVING

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:56.223
THE FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW US TO

01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:58.726
PRESERVE SPENDING. ON THAT

01:39:58.792 --> 01:40:01.395
COULD IT OPERATORS THAT COULD

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:04.131
EXIT THE MARKET. BECAUSE THEY

01:40:04.198 --> 01:40:05.766
HAVE. NOT FOR EXAMPLE AND TO

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:07.835
MAKE SURE THAT WE AND IF THAT

01:40:07.901 --> 01:40:09.069
ISN'T BACK THE RATE LIMITING

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:10.437
FACTOR ABOUT WHAT'S HOLDING

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:11.405
SOMEONE BACK WE CAN SOLVE THAT

01:40:11.472 --> 01:40:16.677
PROBLEM. AS WELL. I THINK WE'LL

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:17.311
CONTINUE HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS

01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:17.845

01:42:32.946 --> 01:42:34.581
IN PARTICULAR- GIVEN THESE

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:36.884

PROPOSED ONE TIME FUNDS- WILL

01:42:45.259 --> 01:42:46.693
BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO ADDRESS

HELP US UNDERSTAND IF ONE TIME-

01:42:57.571 --> 01:42:59.039
IF A ONE TIME FUNDING APPROACH

01:42:59.106 --> 01:43:01.408
WOULD BE- SUFFICIENT AT

01:43:01.475 --> 01:43:03.176
MITIGATING CLOSURES WHILE

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:06.680

01:43:13.287 --> 01:43:16.189
BY- THESE INSUFFICIENT RATES

01:43:16.256 --> 01:43:17.958
THAT WE COULD ASSESS WHETHER A

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:19.960
MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO

01:43:20.027 --> 01:43:21.194

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:24.298
BE- TO INCREASE THOSE RATES FOR

ESTABLISH THIS PROGRAM- BUT

01:44:01.501 --> 01:44:02.669
RATHER THE PROGRAM WOULD BE
