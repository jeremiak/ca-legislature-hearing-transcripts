00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.614
MY NAME IS JENNIFER HALEY I'M

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:22.449
THE PRESIDENT OF CURRENT OIL

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.584
REFINING COMPANY. WE ARE A

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.152
SMALL FAMILY OWNED FACILITY

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.520
OPERATING IN BAKERSFIELD

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:30.056
CALIFORNIA WHERE TWENTY SIX

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:30.557
THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.592
CAPACITY. AND TO PUT THAT IN

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.893
PERSPECTIVE SOME OF THE LARGER

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.228
REFINERS IN THE STATE ARE TWO

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.864
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:38.465

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:41.034
OUR SIZE. I'M WE ARE HERE

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.669
BECAUSE WE GOT CAUGHT UP IN

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.237
LEGISLATION THAT WAS NEVER

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.806
INTENDED TO APPLY TO US. WE

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.408
WERE ASSURED BY THE BILL'S

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.443
AUTHOR AT THAT KERN WAS NOT THE

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.811
INTENDED TARGET OF THE

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:53.746
LEGISLATION. AND ACTUALLY IN

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.081
THE INTERIM THE SOUTH COAST AIR

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.850
QUALITY POLLUTION CONTROL

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.886
DISTRICT HAS ACTUALLY. INVENTED

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.856
REFINERIES THAT ARE BELOW FORTY

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:04.290
THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY. SO

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:05.291
THIS IS REALLY A MATTER OF

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:07.026
EQUITY WHERE IF WE WERE IN LOS

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.595
ANGELES COUNTY WE WOULD BE

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:09.362
EXEMPTED BUT WE ARE NOT

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.531
EXEMPTED UNDER THE CURRENT.

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:12.866
WE'LL WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.767
LOCAL AIR POLLUTION DISTRICT

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:15.702
AND THEY HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.704
AND SUPPORTIVE AND REASONABLE.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.639
BUT THEY NEED CLARIFICATION

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.508
THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE EXEMPTED

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:24.344
UNDER THIS LEGISLATION. AND SO

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.945
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.180
WERE FINALLY LOCATED IN THE

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.048
SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WE

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.250
ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO SOME OF

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.218
THE STRICTEST MONITORING

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:34.020

HAVE DAILY WEEKLY AND MONTHLY

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:38.224
MONITORING ACTIVITIES. THE

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.292
POLLUTANTS THAT ARE MONITORED

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.928
INCLUDE CARBON DIOXIDE VOLATILE

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.297
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS SOCKS. WE

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.665
ACTUALLY HAVE CONTINUOUS

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.500
MONITORING DEVICES ON OUR FUEL

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.569
GAS SYSTEM. AND ALSO ON OUR

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.170
FLARE AND THAT GOES DIRECTLY

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.672
LIVE TO THE AIR POLLUTION

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.974

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.075
TO SAY THAT I AM AGAINST

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:58.077
MONITORING FAR FROM IT. KERN

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:00.446
HAS BEEN AN EXAMPLE OF A

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:01.948
REFINERY THAT HAS EMBRACED THE

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.017

AND ALSO THE EMISSIONS

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:07.554
REDUCTIONS. BUT THIS TYPE OF

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.156
MONITORING WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:12.725
FOR A FACILITY OF OUR SIZE. FOR

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.766
APPLY TO US TO BEGIN WITH. WHAT

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.367

REDUCE OUR PETER SHINS AFTER.

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:49.395

THAT A LOT OF THE EMISSIONS

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:54.861
WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE AREAS

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:57.163
POLLUTION WORSE. AND PERHAPS

TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT AREAS

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.171
BECAUSE CONSTRUCTION IS CIVIL

GLANCE ALSO REGIONAL AND THAT

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:09.409

UNEMPLOYMENT. 8% IS A RATE IN

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.166
KERN COUNTY ALONE. AND SO THESE

ARE IMPORTANT JOBS THE JOBS ARE

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:36.369

REFINERIES TO ACTUALLY PERFORM.

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:50.583
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF MONITORING

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.918
THAT'S NOT WITH LIKE WITH THE

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:04.850
QUESTIONS FIRST OFF NUMBER ONE

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:11.557
THE. IN KERN AND FRESNO. THERE

00:18:11.623 --> 00:18:13.058
WAS A STUDY DONE SOMETIME BACK

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:16.161
IF YOU TOOK EVERY. AND IN EVERY

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:17.095
POLLUTER OUT OF THEIR YOU'D

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:18.130
STILL HAVE POLLUTION THERE

00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:19.932
BECAUSE OF THE BECAUSE QUITE

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:21.166
FRANKLY BECAUSE OF HOW THE

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:23.402
VALLEY LADIES AND SO I'VE IT'S

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:26.038
BEEN A FRUSTRATION OF MINE. I

00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:27.739
ACTUALLY WORKED WITH THE SEVEN

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:29.842
MEMBER SALAS ON TRYING TO. KEEP

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:31.443
A BIOMASS PLANT OPERATING IN

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.444
HIS DISTRICT WHEN I WAS IN THE

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:35.647
STATE ASSEMBLY. AND WE HAD TO

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:36.715
WE HAD THIS YOU KNOW GROUP

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:40.085
COMMON TALK ABOUT. THAT

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:42.254
PARTICULAR MATTERS AND KERN AND

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:45.591
FRESNO WARY AND. AND YOU KNOW

00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:46.225
WE WERE WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:46.892
THAT THE FORCE FROM BURNING

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.560
DOWN WHICH CAUSES A LOT OF THIS

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:49.094
PARTICULAR MATTER SOME. MY

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:52.397
QUESTION ACTUALLY IS TO. TWO

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.832
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE VALLEY

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:55.801
LAYS IN THE WAY THE- THE- THE

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:56.568
EIGHT MINUTES IS A- PET PEEVE

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.570
OF MINE I DON'T WANT TO. PICK A

00:18:58.637 --> 00:18:59.638
FIGHT WITH MY FRIENDS FROM THE

00:18:59.705 --> 00:19:02.074
COAST BUT- I HAVE TO STATE THE

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.609
FACTS AND THE FACTS ARE THAT

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:05.344
THEY GET A FREE RIDE OVER THERE

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.046
BECAUSE THE WIND BLOWS. ALL

00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:08.914
THEIR POLLUTION INTO THE VALLEY

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.750
AND THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO BREED.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:14.253
BECAUSE- THEY HAVE. THEIR

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.488
MANUFACTURING THERE IS. THEIR

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:19.057
QUALITIES BAD AND IS QUITE.

00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:22.895
FRANKLY DUE TO. THE WAY THE

00:19:22.961 --> 00:19:23.428
VALLEY LAYS IN THE WAY THE

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:26.632
WINDS BLOW. SO FOR ME IT'S A

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:31.103
QUESTION OF YOU KNOW. IF THE IF

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:33.872
THE NEIGHBORS THERE. IF YOU

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:35.807
REMOVE THIS PLAN COMPLETE EIGHT

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:36.441
THE PROBLEMS WOULD STILL BE THE

00:19:36.508 --> 00:19:39.478
SAME. AND SO WE HAVE TO STRIKE

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:42.414
A BALANCE HERE SO WE ALLOW. THE

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:42.915
PM MONITORS AT THE COAST

00:19:42.981 --> 00:19:46.385
BECAUSE. IT DOESN'T SINCE LAST

00:19:46.451 --> 00:19:48.220
STAGNANT AIR AND THEY THEY GET

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:49.688
TO POLLUTE AND IT LANDS IN

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.423
THEIR BACKYARDS SO FOR ME

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.090
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:53.926
TRY TO WEIGH OUT ON THESE

00:19:53.992 --> 00:20:00.098
DECISIONS OF. ARE WE ARE WE. IS

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:01.667
THAT WE NEED. IN THE VALLEY

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:03.368
BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY'RE AT AND

00:20:03.435 --> 00:20:04.803
OTHER PEOPLE GET A FREE RIDE SO

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.405
THAT'S- ONE OF THIS IS I THINK

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:08.273
THAT NEEDS TO BE WAIT OUT IN

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:08.874
THIS. IS LEGISLATION THE OTHER

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:09.908
THING I WANT TO. WANT TO SHARE

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:15.914
WITH YOU IS THAT. YOU KNOW. IN

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:19.151
IN MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS.

00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:21.286
OVER AND WHAT IS IT WHAT'S THE

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:23.221
DIFFERENCE A FEW THOUSAND HOW

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:24.156
MANY BARRELS THE DIFFERENCE IS

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:25.924
IT THAT YOU MEET UNDER THIS.

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:29.361
REQUIREMENT WAS IT TEN THOUSAND.

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:31.630
THE MATH HERE ANYWAY SO OUR

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:33.565
FACILITY IS TWENTY SIX THOUSAND

00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:35.100
BARRELS PER DAY THE LARGER

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:37.235
REFINERS THAT THIS WAS INTENDED

00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:39.371
FOR A TEN TIMES OUR SIZE OF TWO

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:39.938
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A DAY

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:42.474
ASH. THOSE ARE THE THOSE WILL

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:44.710
BE THE REASONS FOR ME TO BE

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:46.912
CONSIDERING THIS BILL. BECAUSE

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:49.948
I THINK THAT QUITE FRANKLY. THE

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:51.583
VALLEY HAS A REALLY BIG

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.585
CHALLENGES AND I THINK PART OF

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:54.753
MAJORITY YOUR PROBLEM IS NOT

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.322
FROM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOCAL

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:57.889
THEY'RE OF MAJORITY PROBLEMS

00:20:57.956 --> 00:20:58.457
FROM POLLUTION COME IN FROM

00:20:58.523 --> 00:21:03.228
SOMEWHERE ELSE. YEAH THAT

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:06.832
REALLY THE CASE. THAT'S RIGHT

00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:07.466
IF YOU WANT YEAH THAT IS TRUE I

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:09.768
CAN LISTEN IN. OKAY STERN I

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:15.474
DON'T. IF I HAD TO GET THERE.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.341
JUST TO JUST TO CLARIFY HOW THE

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:16.842
CLEAN AIR ACT WORKS IN

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:17.476
CALIFORNIA INTERBASE AND

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:19.611
TRANSPORT OF POLLUTANTS ARE

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:21.513
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.348
CENTRAL VALLEY THE SAN JOAQUIN

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:24.182
AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICTS

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:25.617
PLAN SO IT'S SORT OF BACKED

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:28.353
OUT. THOSE BAY AREA NUMBERS AND

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.956
THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF POLLUTION

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:32.524
COURTING THE NUMBERS IS MOBILE

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:33.925
SOURCE THERE SO IN IN THE

00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:36.495
VALLEY BUT THAT IS THAT I

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:37.796
WANTED TO TRY IT I KNOW THIS I

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:40.632
KNOW THIS IS A CRITICAL. ISSUE

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:43.335
FOR YOU ALL AND YOU'RE SAYING

00:21:43.402 --> 00:21:44.336
YOU WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING

00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:46.571
AND WHICH I MEANT WHAT WOULD

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:48.306
YOU SAY A MILLION DOLLARS

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:49.441
MILLION AND A HALF TO. INSTALL

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:52.110
THE SYSTEM. YOU KNOW IT FRANKLY

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:53.245
IT DEPENDS WE DON'T KNOW

00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:54.479
EXACTLY WHAT THE SYSTEMS WILL

00:21:54.546 --> 00:21:55.180
LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW WHICH

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:56.048
OBVIOUSLY GIVE US SOME

00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:58.350
HEARTBURN BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:21:58.417 --> 00:21:59.251
A MILLION A HALF MAYBE EVEN UP

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:01.620
TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS SO. I

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:03.555
KNOW WE'VE TALKED IN THE PAST

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:04.322
ABOUT SOME YOUR EFFORTS ON LOW

00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:05.924
CARBON FUEL PRODUCTION AND

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:07.559
OTHERS A PREMIUM IN THE

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:09.094
MARKETPLACE RIGHT NOW FOR

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:10.562
PRODUCTION THOSE LOWER LOW

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:13.432
CARBON FUELS. SO WANNA GET SENT

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:14.900
THROUGH A ABOUT THAT REVENUE

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:17.202
SOURCE AND THE ABILITY OFFSET

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:19.237
ANY THESE COST TO PROTECT THOSE

00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:20.238
NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND GIVE

00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:21.807
THEM SOME ASSURANCE BUT

00:22:21.873 --> 00:22:28.680
SECONDARILY ISN'T THERE ALSO A.

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:29.181
GRANT PROGRAM THAT WERE

00:22:29.247 --> 00:22:33.085
MINISTERING IS PART OF. AND

00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:34.386
IT'S GONNA SKATE ME THE BILL

00:22:34.453 --> 00:22:34.986
NUMBER IT WAS IT WAS WHAT CAME

00:22:35.053 --> 00:22:35.620
WITH THE FENCE. IT WAS WE CAME

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:36.254
WITH THE FENCE LINE MONITORING

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:37.622
LEGISLATION WE DID WHERE WE'VE

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:38.857
BEEN GIVING OUT GRANTS SIX

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:39.424
SEVENTEEN. I WILL BE SO YOU

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:41.526
GUYS APPLIED OR HAS THE AS THE

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.395
DISTRICT APPLIED FOR ANY OF

00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:45.130
THOSE GRANTS FOR. FOR FANS Là

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:47.199
MONITOR. SO FIRST YOUR FIRST

00:22:47.265 --> 00:22:48.800
QUESTION YEAH SO KERN ACTUALLY

00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.635
WAS THE SECOND REFINERY IN THE

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:52.471
COUNTRY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:53.772
NINE TO GET IT EPA FUEL

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:55.273
REGISTRATION FOR OUR RENEWABLE

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.441
DIESEL. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE

00:22:56.508 --> 00:22:58.877
INCREDIBLY PROUD OF. WE ALSO

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:01.012
GLENN BIODIESEL SINCE TWENTY

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:01.947
TWELVE INVENTING BIODIESEL IN

00:23:02.013 --> 00:23:04.316
OUR DIESEL AND WE ALSO HAVE AB

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:06.752
TWENTY A 20% BIODIESEL. PRODUCT

00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:08.720
THAT WE INTRODUCED IN TWENTY

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:09.488
SEVENTEEN WHICH IS NOW ACTUALLY

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:11.823
10% OF OUR DIESEL FAILED. WHEN

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.126
IT COMES TO YOU KNOW THE

00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:15.127
PROFITABILITY ASSOCIATE WITH

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:17.162
THOSE RENEWABLE FUELS. US

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:17.996
SUFFICE TO SAY HEY THE

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:20.966
RENEWABLE DIESEL WAS INCREDIBLY

00:23:21.032 --> 00:23:23.368
DIFFICULT. THE FEEDSTOCK THAT

00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:24.736
WE'RE USING IS VERY DIFFICULT

00:23:24.803 --> 00:23:26.037
ON THE METALLURGY WE GO THROUGH

00:23:26.104 --> 00:23:28.039
KATALYST MUCH QUICKER. IT'S AN

00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:29.808
INCREDIBLY CAPITAL INTENSIVE

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.076
AND IT WAS A TO A TYPE OF

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:33.278
BUSINESS THAT. WE MIGHT FRANKLY

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:34.679
STILL BE LOSING MONEY ON BUT

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:36.047
CERTAINLY IN THE EARLY YEARS

00:23:36.114 --> 00:23:37.382
WELL WE TRY TO WORK THROUGH THE

00:23:37.449 --> 00:23:38.683
PROCESS WE WERE OUR OWN PILOT

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.318
PROGRAM FOR THAT. BUT THAT WAS

00:23:40.385 --> 00:23:41.353
SOMETHING MORE KERN FELT

00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:43.255
STRONGLY THAT THE FUTURE IS

00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:44.956
RENEWABLES AND SO WE FELT IT

00:23:45.023 --> 00:23:46.224
WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE THOSE

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:47.759
INVESTMENTS NOT TO BE OUT IN

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:49.628
THE MARKET. BUYING COMPLIANCE

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:51.196
INSTRUMENTS INSTEAD REALLY TO

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.564
EMBRACE WHERE THE STATE IS

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:53.932
GOING AND TO DO THE RENEWABLE

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:55.133
FUELS. SO THAT THAT WAS

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.569
IMPORTANT TO US. AND FRANKLY AS

00:23:57.636 --> 00:23:59.571
FAR AS THE PROFITABILITY. IT

00:23:59.638 --> 00:24:00.806
DEPENDS ON THE COMPLIANCE AND

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.340
THROUGH MY MARKETS AND THOSE

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:03.708
MOVE AROUND A LOT AND WE ALSO

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:05.644
HAVE OVERLAPPING OBLIGATIONS ON

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.179
THE FEDERAL SIDE. AND THE STATE

00:24:07.245 --> 00:24:08.580
SIDE THURSDAY WE HAVE LOW

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:09.948
CARBON FUEL STANDARD IN CAP AND

00:24:10.015 --> 00:24:11.216
TRADE ON THE FEDERAL SIDE WE

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.517
HAVE THE RENEWABLE FUEL

00:24:12.584 --> 00:24:14.319
STANDARD. UNFORTUNATELY THOSE

00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:15.487
PROGRAMS DO NOT LINE UP. SO

00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:17.189
FUELS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP

00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:18.523
US UNDER THE RENEWABLE FUEL

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.125
STANDARD DON'T NECESSARILY HELP

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:21.426
US AND THE CALIFORNIA STANDARD.

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:22.360
WE HAVE TO KIND OF THREAD THE

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:23.728
NEEDLE SO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF

00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:29.334
FUEL PRODUCTION IS LOW CARBON.

00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:29.968
FUEL RIGHT NOW VERSUS STRAIGHT.

00:24:30.035 --> 00:24:36.041
PATROLLING. I THINK IT DEPENDS

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:37.609
ON HOW YOU DEFINE IT BUT OUR-

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:38.076
BEST VIEW OF THE FIRST

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:40.512
COMPLAINT. SO ALL OF OUR FUEL

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:41.746
IS OF THE OFFICE CLIENT BUT

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:42.480
THAT YOU'RE GETTING CREDIT FOR

00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:43.114
FROM THE US IF THIS PROGRAM SO

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:44.015
RIGHT NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE A

00:24:44.082 --> 00:24:45.217
RESTRICTION WHEN IT COMES TO

00:24:45.283 --> 00:24:46.451
LABELING. AND SO FOR OUR FINISH

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:47.819
DIESEL THAT GOES OUT THE GATE

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:50.689
UP 25% CONTAINS RENEWABLE

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:52.123
DIESEL THAT WE PRODUCE ON SITE

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.158
LIKE I SAID WE'RE THE ONLY ONES

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:54.159
IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE PRETTY

00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:56.595
THING THAT. AND UP 25% OF THE

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:59.497
DIESEL ALSO INCLUDES BIODIESEL

00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:00.532
SOMETIMES THE KNOWLEDGE AS A

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:02.467
LITTLE BIT TO HIDING VEGETABLES

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:03.501
AND FOOD WERE YOUR CHILDREN

00:25:03.568 --> 00:25:04.636
DON'T KNOW THE VEGETABLES ARE

00:25:04.703 --> 00:25:06.171
IN THERE. IT'S VERY SIMILAR

00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:07.339
WITH THE FEELS RIGHT THE FEELS

00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:08.340
ARE IN THERE BUT IT GOES OUT

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:09.941
THE GATE AS DIESEL AND IT'S

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:12.711
ALSO SOLD AS DIESEL. TO GO

00:25:12.777 --> 00:25:14.546
ABOVE THE 5% YOU WOULD HAVE TO

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:16.548
ACTUALLY HAVE A SEPARATE LABEL

00:25:16.615 --> 00:25:17.148
FOR THE PUMPS WHICH MAKES IT

00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:18.316
DIFFICULT FROM A MARKET

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:20.018
ACCEPTANCE. THE WAY WE HAVE

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:23.121
GOTTEN AROUND BAD OR HER DOING

00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:24.556
THAT IS THE B. TWENTY PRODUCT

00:25:24.623 --> 00:25:26.057
WHERE WE ACTUALLY NOW SELL A

00:25:26.124 --> 00:25:27.826
SEPARATE PRODUCT THE HAS THE

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:30.028
TWENTY PERCENT. BIODIESEL SO

00:25:30.095 --> 00:25:31.529
THOSE ARE THE AREAS WHERE WE

00:25:31.596 --> 00:25:33.665
HAVE THE RENEWABLE FUELS WE

00:25:33.732 --> 00:25:34.266
ALSO BRING ENOUGH AND ALL IN

00:25:34.332 --> 00:25:38.036
ONE UP 210% ETHANOL. PERCENTAGE

00:25:38.103 --> 00:25:41.773
ARE YOU DOING AT THE TWENTY.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.674
I'M 10% OF OUR GASOLINE SALES

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:44.175
WITH ELDER THREE NINE THOUSAND

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:44.809
AND TEN THOUSAND BARRELS A DAY

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:45.777
AND SO. 10% AFTERNOON IF YOU

00:25:45.844 --> 00:25:46.645
TOOK MORE OF THAT FORCED BY A

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:47.579
MESS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:49.180
OR OTHER SORTS OF FEEDSTOCKS

00:25:49.247 --> 00:25:50.982
AND BEFORE ADD BY MASS OUT OF

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:52.984
THE VALLEY RIGHT. LOCALLY AND

00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:54.052
THEN START TO CONVERT THAT INTO

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:56.288
RENAULT WILL DIESEL AND-

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:57.756
GENERATED MORE REVENUE SAY YOU

00:25:57.822 --> 00:25:59.691
DOUBLE THE AMOUNT. YOU WHEN

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:01.326
YOU'RE FAR OFFSET WHATEVER THE

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:04.296
MILLION DOLLARS IS OUR MILLION

00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:04.863
FIVE THAT YOU NEED FOR THIS

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.499
FENCE LINE MONITORING. SO I'M

00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:08.133
NOT SURE I ENTIRELY UNDERSTAND

00:26:08.199 --> 00:26:10.068
THE QUESTION. I THINK WHEN IT

00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:12.671
COMES TO OUR RENEWABLE FUELS.

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.072
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAPITAL

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:14.973
INTENSIVE AND IT'S HARD ON OUR

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.308
BUSINESS THAT WE'VE INVESTED IN

00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:17.342
IT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:19.844
RIGHT THING TO DO. WE ARE MONEY

00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:20.979
WOULD YOU MAKE IF YOU IF YOU

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:22.847
DOUBLE YOUR- PRODUCTION I THINK

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:23.815
THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.550
NOW IS WE'RE LOOKING TO INVEST

00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:26.785
IN ADDITIONAL RENEWABLE FUEL

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:28.386
OPPORTUNITIES. BUT WE DON'T

00:26:28.453 --> 00:26:30.655
HAVE THE CAPITAL AND SO FOR US

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:31.623
TO SPEND YOU KNOW A MILLION AND

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:32.691
A HALF TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS

00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:34.326
ON OFFENSE BY MONITORING WHERE

00:26:34.392 --> 00:26:35.827
WE ALREADY HAVE THE MONITORING

00:26:35.894 --> 00:26:37.262
REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE. RIGHT I

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:38.129
GET THAT I GET YOUR MAIN

00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:39.931
ARGUMENT I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:41.566
YOU I GET THAT I'M JUST TRYING

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:42.534
TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH MORE

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.168
YOU'D MAKE IF YOU DOUBLE YOUR-

00:26:43.234 --> 00:26:44.402
BIODIESEL. PRODUCTION TO BE

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:45.503
HONEST I THINK WE WOULD LOSE

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.205
MONEY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:48.940
BEFORE WE WOULD ACTUALLY CATCH

00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:49.641
UP TO THE INVESTMENT THAT WE

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:51.609
WOULD HAVE TO MAKE. AND THEN

00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:53.244
HAVE YOU APPLIED FOR THOSE SIX

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:54.245
SEVENTEEN GRANT. WE HAVE NOT

00:26:54.312 --> 00:26:56.481
WHY. I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THEY

00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:57.949
EXISTED UNTIL WE TALKED ABOUT

00:26:58.016 --> 00:26:59.117
THEM IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT IT'S

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:00.285
SOMETHING I'LL BE LOOKING INTO.

00:27:00.352 --> 00:27:02.020
SEEMS LIKE A GOOD OPTION. AND

00:27:02.087 --> 00:27:02.988
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:27:03.054 --> 00:27:04.189
WE'VE BEEN DOING IS WE'VE BEEN

00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:05.256
AGGRESSIVELY MEETING WITH THE

00:27:05.323 --> 00:27:06.591
REGULATORY AGENCIES AND TALKING

00:27:06.658 --> 00:27:08.026
ABOUT OUR DESIRE TO EXPAND OUR

00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:09.527
RENEWABLE FUELS. AND LOOKING

00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:10.795
FOR OPPORTUNITIES WITH AIR

00:27:10.862 --> 00:27:12.197
RESOURCE BOARD AND ALSO WITH

00:27:12.263 --> 00:27:12.664
THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:14.566
COMMISSION. OF WHERE WE CAN GET

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:17.335
HELP. YOU KNOW NOT TO CLIMB

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:18.570
BACK UP ON MY SOAPBOX SO TO

00:27:18.636 --> 00:27:21.106
SPEAK BUT- 80% OF SMALL

00:27:21.172 --> 00:27:22.240
REFINERS IN THE COUNTRY HAVE

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:23.041
GONE OUT OF BUSINESS IN THE

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:24.709
LAST TWENTY YEARS. IT IS AN

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:27.078
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT MARKET. WE

00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:28.480
ARE DOING THE BEST THAT WE CAN

00:27:28.546 --> 00:27:30.515
TO BE A GOOD CORPORATE CITIZEN

00:27:30.582 --> 00:27:31.950
AND TO EMBRACE THE STATE'S

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:33.985
CLIMATE. AND RENEWABLE FUEL

00:27:34.052 --> 00:27:36.488
GOALS BUT IF WE'RE REGULATED AT

00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:38.089
THE SAME CAPACITY AS A

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:40.058
MULTINATIONAL YOU KNOW BILLION

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:41.626
DOLLAR PLUS MARKET CAP

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:43.194
CORPORATION WITH FACILITIES TEN

00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:45.030
TIMES OUR SIZE. WE CANNOT

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:47.232
SURVIVE. AND SO THIS REALLY IS

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:49.000
ABOUT DOING WHAT MAKES SENSE

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:50.735
FOR OUR FACILITY AND MAKING

00:27:50.802 --> 00:27:52.370
SURE OUR DOLLARS ARE BEING

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:53.204
SPENT IMPROVING THE COMMUNITY.

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:55.073
GET IT I JUST YOU HAVE A I'VE

00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:00.011
MET WITH YOUR. LOBBYIST THEIR

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:00.645
SOPHISTICATED PLAYERS GIVE SOME

00:28:00.712 --> 00:28:06.584
VERY. CAPABLE ADVOCATES HERE

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:07.185
FOR YOU IN THE SENATE AND THE

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:08.720
ASSEMBLY. HUNDREDS OF OTHER

00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:09.354
PEOPLE OF FIVE OR SIX SEVENTEEN

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:10.755
GRANTS ACROSS THE STATE. I JUST

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:11.656
I DON'T I DON'T SEE WHY THAT

00:28:11.723 --> 00:28:12.190
AND YOU TALK TO THE

00:28:12.257 --> 00:28:12.924
ADMINISTRATION ALREADY AND

00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:13.491
NOBODY BROUGHT THIS UP AS A

00:28:13.558 --> 00:28:14.626
POTENTIAL OPTION SO I THINK

00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:16.461
WHEN IT COMES TO SIX SEVENTEEN

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.395
GRANTS OBVIOUSLY SIX SEVENTEEN

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:18.029
IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:19.631
PROCESS. AND WHAT WE'RE

00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:20.932
PURSUING RIGHT NOW WOULD NOT

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:22.801
AFFECT SIX SEVENTEEN AND SO THE

00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:24.702
REQUIREMENTS THAT COME DOWN.

00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:26.771
UNDER SIX SEVENTEEN IS

00:28:26.838 --> 00:28:27.705
SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT

00:28:27.772 --> 00:28:29.441
SEPARATELY RIGHT NOW WE DON'T

00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:30.008
KNOW WHAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:30.942
ARE THEY'RE STILL DOING THE

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:33.912
COMMUNITY PROCESS BUT I DO I

00:28:33.978 --> 00:28:34.512
REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENT

00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:35.213
OF THE GRANT MONEY AND IT'S

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.816
SOMETHING LOOK INTO. AND I WILL

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:38.983
SAY WHAT IT COMES TO FOR

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.919
SOPHISTICATION THIS IS MY FIRST

00:28:40.985 --> 00:28:41.786
TIME TESTIFYING BEFORE

00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:43.555
COMMITTEE LIKE THAT'S GREAT

00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:45.123
WELL I AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.591
OUR OUR HELPERS EARNESTNESS IS

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:48.860
REAL AND I TOTALLY GET THAT

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:49.427
WERE JUST TRYING TO FIND A

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:51.863
CREATIVE WAY AROUND THIS AND-

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:52.931
TO AVOID THE PRECEDENT SETTING

00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:55.366
NATURE AND STILL. TO LET YOU

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:57.535
GUYS KEEP KEEP YOU KNOW STAY IN

00:28:57.602 --> 00:29:02.574
BUSINESS BUT DOING AWAY SAID.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.212
WE'RE NOT GOING TO. CREATE. ADD

00:29:07.278 --> 00:29:08.746
PRESIDENT IN THE STATE AND IT

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:09.347
SOUNDS LIKE IS IT BEING

00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:10.348
LITIGATED THIS THE SOUTH COAST

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:11.149
DECISION DO WE KNOW IS THAT

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:11.783
ACTUALLY IN COURT RIGHT NOW AS

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:12.383
FAR AS I KNOW IT'S NOT BEING

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.185
LITIGATED RIGHT NOW AND I THINK

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:15.553
WHEN IT COMES TO PRESIDENT WE

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.154
TALKED A LOT ABOUT SOUTH COAST

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:18.423
BECAUSE IT'S SO GERMANE. BUT WE

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.058
ACTUALLY THERE ARE AS PRESIDENT

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:21.426
OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL

00:29:21.493 --> 00:29:22.527
FOR SMALL REFINERS BEING

00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:23.862
TREATED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF

00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:25.330
THE NATURE OF THEIR BUSINESS.

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:26.297
ACTUALLY BEFORE THE AIR

00:29:26.364 --> 00:29:27.999
RESOURCES BOARD. WE GET THE

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:29.400
BENEFIT OF THE LOW COMPLEXITY

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:30.468
LOW ENERGY USEFOR FIGHTER

00:29:30.535 --> 00:29:32.470
CREDIT. AND SO THEY RECOGNIZE

00:29:32.537 --> 00:29:34.172
THAT THE FUEL WE PRODUCE HAS A

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:35.807
LOWER CARBON INTENSITY THAN THE

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:37.041
FUEL PRODUCED BY THE LARGER

00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:38.877
REFINERS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE

00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:40.445
OF OUR FACILITY. AND SO THAT'S

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:41.346
SOMETHING RIGHT NOW

00:29:41.412 --> 00:29:42.614
UNFORTUNATELY KERN IS THE ONLY

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.948
REFINERY IN THE STATE THAT GETS

00:29:44.015 --> 00:29:45.517
THE BENEFIT OF THAT CREDIT.

00:29:45.583 --> 00:29:48.419
BECAUSE WERE THE LAST MILE

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:49.020
REFINERY LEFT THAT'S PRODUCING

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:52.690
TRANSPORTATION FUEL. IF I COULD

00:29:52.757 --> 00:29:53.725
JUST RESPOND JUST A SECOND THE

00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:54.826
ULTRA LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:55.426
THAT ARE GONNA TAKE PLACE ON

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:56.027
THE SOUL FOR TWENTY TWENTY.

00:29:56.094 --> 00:29:56.828
KERN IS AHEAD OF THE GAME ON

00:29:56.895 --> 00:29:59.464
THIS AND TO LIMIT THEIR ABILITY

00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:00.598
TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THIS

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:02.834
TECHNOLOGY IS. IS SOMETHING

00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:03.935
THAT I WOULD REALLY ASK YOU

00:30:04.002 --> 00:30:07.672
GUYS TO CONSIDER NOT DOING. AND

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:09.374
IF I COULD SURPRISE THE BRITISH

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.108
GET ALL THE DISCUSSIONS THAT

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:11.242
WE'VE HAD IN DISCUSSING WITH

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:12.477
THE ADMINISTRATION AND EVEN THE

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:14.379
AUTHOR YOU KNOW THEY WERE AN

00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:15.580
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE WHEN YOU

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:16.915
LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF PERILS

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:18.082
THERE'S PRESIDENT AND STATE LAW

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:19.417
ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH SMALL

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:20.652
REFINERS COMPARED TO THE LARGE

00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:22.520
REFINERIES. SO IS SOMETHING

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:23.821
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AND I THINK

00:30:23.888 --> 00:30:25.223
THAT'S WHY YOU SAW SOUTH COAST

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.791
TO THE ROLE THAT THEY DID THIS

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:29.027
BECAUSE THEY WERE NEVER THE

00:30:29.093 --> 00:30:29.527
INTENDED TARGET. OF THE

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:33.364
ORIGINAL LEGISLATION. SKINNER

00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:33.965
SO THIS MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:36.834
FULLY EXHAUSTED BUT- GIVEN AT

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:38.269
SOUTH COAST DID SUCH A RULE

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:40.138
THIS DOES NOT NEED A LOT THIS

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:43.041
IS NOT NEED A STATUTE WHY

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:43.608
DIDN'T AIR DISTRICT. IN YOUR

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:47.212
AREA. ACT SIMILARLY AS SOUTH

00:30:47.278 --> 00:30:49.847
COAST DID. I'M YOU KNOW I DON'T

00:30:49.914 --> 00:30:52.617
THINK THAT THEY HAVE ALL SAY

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:53.918
THESE ARE MY WORDS AND NO ONE

00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:55.220
ELSE'S MAYBE THE CLOUD AND THE

00:30:55.286 --> 00:30:57.589
MIGHT OF THE SOUTH COAST.

00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:58.957
OBVIOUSLY SOUTH COAST TENDS TO

00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:00.225
BE A LEADER AND ON THE CUTTING

00:31:00.291 --> 00:31:01.726
EDGE OF KIND OF THE REGULATIONS

00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:02.894
AND REALLY THOUGHT FOR STANDARD

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:05.296
IN THE STATE. I THINK OUR LOCAL

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:06.831
DISTRICT REALLY WANTS TO BE

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:09.968
REASONABLE BUT THE POSITION AS

00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:11.502
I UNDERSTAND IT IS THEY DON'T

00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:12.370
THINK THAT THE CURRENT

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:14.505
REGULATION IS CLEAR. THAT THERE

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:17.008
IS YOU KNOW A 100% THAT A

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:18.876
THIRTY FOR THEM TO TAKE THAT

00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:20.078
POSITION AND FOR THE DIRECTION

00:31:20.144 --> 00:31:21.946
THAT WE GOT YES. STUDENTS OUT

00:31:22.013 --> 00:31:22.981
BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEING

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:25.183
LITIGATED I WAS GONNA SAY IF

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:26.384
YOU WANT ME TO TESTIFY AND ALL

00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:29.854
THE TIMES THAT REGULAR YEAH

00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:30.488
YEAH YEAH YOU DON'T AGREE WE'RE

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:31.122
GONNA HAVE VERY LONG. YEAH YEAH

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:33.691
YEAH. THAT'S TRUE. YEAH AND SO

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:34.492
WE'RE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:37.829
IT THE RIGHT WAY WERE TRYING TO.

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:39.130
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE OUR CASE

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:41.366
AND BE TREATED THE WAY WE

00:31:41.432 --> 00:31:42.934
SHOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED

00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:43.534
FRANKLY FROM THE BEGINNING AND

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:48.139
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT. FUND

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:49.907
STAFF REPORT ON PAGE TWO TALKS

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.576
ABOUT GIVING THE AUTHORITY TO

00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:52.944
THE DISTRICT AND HAVING THEM

00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:55.213
GIVING. GIVING CURRENT OIL OR

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.849
FROM EVER MAY BE THE- THAT THAT

00:31:57.915 --> 00:31:59.951
PROVIDER THAT GUIDES I MEAN IF

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:02.754
THE MAYOR CG BILL SPELLS OUT.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.789
THAT THIS WAS TO APPLY TO

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:05.356
EVERYBODY IN THE STATE OF

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:07.358
CALIFORNIA WAS IN THE TORRANCE.

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:09.360
DEAL IN IN A CAVE THE

00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:13.031
APPROPRIATE DISTRICTS. THE

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:13.631
AUTHORITY TO GIVE GUIDANCE TO

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:15.900
FOLKS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.702
THAT YOU SHOULD RECEIVE NO

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.437
GUIDANCE FROM SAN JOAQUIN.

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:22.407
VALLEY NOT NOTHING ON THIS ON

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:24.475
THIS ISSUE. THEIR SILENCE SO

00:32:24.542 --> 00:32:25.543
THEY ARE PRESUMED THAT YOU MUST

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.046
HAVE. ONE MONITORING ON THE

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:28.880
FENCE LINE AND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:30.782
RIGHT I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:32.317
THEIR RULE AND WHAT THEY'RE

00:32:32.383 --> 00:32:33.384
GOING TO REQUIRE FRANKLY IS

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:34.519
STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND SO I

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:35.853
THINK THE POSSIBILITY OF THEM

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.854
HAVING A RULE IN PLACE AND

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:38.556
GOING TO THE PUBLIC PROCESS.

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:40.091
BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR IS

00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:41.893
UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT AND NOT

00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:43.061
BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IN A

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:44.996
DIFFICULT POSITION LIKE I SAID

00:32:45.063 --> 00:32:47.098
I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:48.032
WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING I THINK

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:48.766
THEY'RE TRYING TO STRIKE THE

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.535
RIGHT BALANCE. BUT THIS DOES

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:51.569
SEEM SOMETHING APPROPRIATE

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:52.770
GIVEN THAT IT CAME FROM THE

00:32:52.837 --> 00:32:54.305
LEGISLATURE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:54.372 --> 00:32:57.342
TO PROVIDE THE CLARIFICATION OF

00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:58.109
WHAT THIS BILL REALLY WAS

00:32:58.176 --> 00:33:00.978
INTENDED TO ADDRESS. AND TO

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:03.381
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. WE'RE

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:05.516
NOT PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON THE

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.452
LOCAL DISTRICT BUT TYPICALLY IN

00:33:07.518 --> 00:33:10.355
THIS SITUATION. TYPICALLY IN

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:11.356
THIS SITUATION IF THE LOCAL.

00:33:11.422 --> 00:33:13.491
APPROPRIATE AGENCY HAS NOT

00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:15.026
DEVELOPED RULES THAT THEY NEED

00:33:15.093 --> 00:33:17.261
TO DO BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY

00:33:17.328 --> 00:33:18.329
TWENTY WE ASK FOR ANOTHER YEAR

00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:19.797
WE ASK FOR ANOTHER YEAR. TO

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:20.765
GIVE THEM THE TIME TO MAKE

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:22.900
THOSE LOCAL DECISIONS. THE

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:25.470
PROPOSAL BEFORE US IS NOT FOR

00:33:25.536 --> 00:33:27.138
NOT TO MATCH SOUTH COAST. IS TO

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:30.808
GO 255% SO WHAT'S THE

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:32.276
COMPELLING REASON OR FIFTY

00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:35.847
FIVE. THOUSAND BARRELS. OR

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:36.414
GALLONS VERSUS FORTY SO WHAT

00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:40.118
WOULD BE. IN MY MIND IT'S HARD

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:43.254
TO SWALLOW YES IF YOU ASK FOR

00:33:43.321 --> 00:33:46.624
MORE TIME FOR SAN JOAQUIN.

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:49.360
VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:49.994
DISTRICT ISSUE TO COME UP WITH

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:53.064
APPROPRIATE. GUIDANCE FOR SMALL

00:33:53.131 --> 00:33:56.100
REFINERS AND WILL DEAL WITH

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:56.834
THAT AS THEY GO THROUGH THAT

00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:59.170
RULE MAKING THAT'S ONE THING

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:01.839
BUT THIS IS ASKING FOR A- NO

00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:04.208
LOOK AT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND.

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:08.312
GALLONS. GALLONS BERYL'S ERROL

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:10.515
SORRY I GET THE RIGHT PERSIST

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:11.582
FORTY WHICH IS WE'VE HEARD FROM

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:13.684
SOME OF THE ADVOCATES THEY

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:15.686
BELIEVE IS UNWARRANTED SO I

00:34:15.753 --> 00:34:16.854
THINK AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION

00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:18.556
TO MAKE IS THIS IS ACTUALLY A

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:21.392
MUCH MORE RESTRICTIVE.

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:23.227
EXEMPTION THAT THAN THAT WHAT

00:34:23.294 --> 00:34:24.328
IS CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY SOUTH

00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:26.197
COAST BECAUSE IT'S A TWO FOLD

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:28.633
TACT THE FIFTY FIVE IS BASED ON

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.168
EXISTING STATE LAWS THAT

00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:31.836
RECOGNIZE THE SMALL REFINERIES

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.471
AND SO THAT IS WHY WE USE THAT

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:35.573
CRITERIA. THAT'S WHY THAT

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.542
CRITERIA WAS USED THE SECOND

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:39.343
PIECE OF CRITERIA HAS TO DO

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:41.779
WITH POPULATION DENSITY AND IS

00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:43.514
EXTREMELY RESTRICTIVE ADDS TO

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:45.016
THE POPULATION DENSITY AROUND

00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:46.217
THE FACILITY WHICH IS DESIGNED

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:48.119
TO NARROW. THE SCOPE OF THE

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:50.888
EXEMPTION EVEN MORE BECAUSE THE

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:52.190
ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF THE BILL

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:53.591
WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON

00:34:53.658 --> 00:34:55.059
REFINERIES THAT ARE LOCATED IN

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:58.629
CITIES AND DENSELY POPULATED

00:34:58.696 --> 00:34:59.197
URGENT URBAN CENTERS. TO BE

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:01.766
CLEAR. I AM VERY CONCERNED AND

00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:02.733
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.635
PROTECTING ALL OF THE PEOPLE

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:06.471
AROUND OUR REFINERY AND I'M NOT

00:35:06.537 --> 00:35:07.572
SAYING THAT TO SAY THAT THE

00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:10.575
RULE. NATURE OF IT MEANS THAT

00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:12.076
WE DON'T NEED TO PAY ATTENTION

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:14.045
TO IT I THINK THAT THE TWO

00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:15.580
CRITERIA LIMITS THE

00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:17.415
APPLICABILITY. AND IT LOOKS

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:19.450
REALLY AT THE SMALL REFINERIES

00:35:19.517 --> 00:35:21.118
THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE

00:35:21.185 --> 00:35:22.820
IMPLEMENTING THESE REGULATIONS

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:24.188
AND LIKE I SAID A MONITORING

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:25.590
SYSTEM IS NOT GOING TO PROVIDE

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:27.525
A BENEFIT TO THE VALLEY IS NOT

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:28.359
GOING TO PROVIDE A BENEFIT AND

00:35:28.426 --> 00:35:30.294
ACTUALLY REDUCING THE EMISSION.

00:35:30.361 --> 00:35:31.662
BUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO SPEND THAT

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:32.997
ONE POINT FIVE TO THREE MILLION

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:35.099
DOLLARS. TO DO ACTUAL EMISSIONS

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:37.802
REDUCTIONS PROJECTS THAT'S

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:38.469
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:40.204
HAVE THAT POSITIVE EFFECT. AND

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:41.772
SO THAT'S REALLY OUR CONTENTION

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.908
IS THAT THIS. THIS IS WAS NOT

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:44.909
INTENDED FOR A FACILITY OF OUR

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:47.645
SIZE AND OUR MAKE UP IT'S NOT

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:49.580
GOING TO PROVIDE A REAL BENEFIT

00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:50.915
TO THE COMMUNITY AND WE CAN DO

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:53.217
OTHER THINGS WITH THOSE FUNDS.

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:54.519
TO REALLY HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:55.987
THE VALLEY THE END SENATOR I

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:56.854
THINK THAT'S WHY THEY WANT TO

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:57.522
JUST COME BACK TO THE

00:35:57.588 --> 00:36:00.057
LEGISLATURE AND ACTUALLY LOOK

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:01.292
FOR LEGISLATIVE FIX BECAUSE IT

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:02.426
WAS NEVER INTENDED CON. AND THE

00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:03.728
INTENDED CONSEQUENCE TO GO

00:36:03.794 --> 00:36:06.597
AFTER A SMALL REFINERY. LIKE

00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:07.999
SHE SPEAKING ABOUT SO THEY SAID

00:36:08.065 --> 00:36:08.633
WELL IF WE GO BACK TO

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:10.468
LEGISLATURE AND FIX THAT. YOU

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:11.602
KNOW THAT BE THE PREFERRED

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:13.137
ROUTE RATHER THAT NOW DEALING

00:36:13.204 --> 00:36:15.006
WITH OKAY SOUTH COAST IN A ROLE

00:36:15.072 --> 00:36:16.440
SAN JOAQUIN STILL CONSIDERING

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:17.542
THE ROLE AND MAYBE THEY'LL BE

00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:18.676
LITIGATION MAYBE THEY'RE NOT

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:19.677
BUT IF THEY WERE NEVER INTENDED

00:36:19.744 --> 00:36:21.412
CONSEQUENCE. WHICH YOU CAN

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:23.080
VERIFY WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE

00:36:23.147 --> 00:36:24.482
BILL IN THE ADMINISTRATION AS

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:26.484
WELL. THEN THEY WERE THINKING

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:27.652
WELL MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A

00:36:27.718 --> 00:36:28.519
LEGISLATIVE FIX AND JUST BE

00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:29.353
DONE WITH THE ISSUE. YEAH BUT

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.355
THAT MEASURE THE CHAIR I'M

00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:32.123
SORRY THROUGH CHAIR OF THE

00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:32.990
REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE SET

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:33.524
FORTH ARE BASED ON STATE

00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:35.893
ASSISTANCE IN LAW RIGHT NOW. SO

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.694
THE REASON WE DIDN'T GO JUST

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:38.262
LIKE EQUAL TO OF LIKE AND

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:40.498
JENNIFER WAS SAYING. IS YOU

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:45.169
KNOW FIFTY. FIVE THOUSAND

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:50.908
BARRELS IS WHAT'S- PUT IN

00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:52.810
EXISTING STAFF MY- GENERATION.

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:53.611
HAVE KIND OF LIKE A- THIS BILL

00:36:53.678 --> 00:36:54.111
DID THIS THE SOUTH COAST

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.546
DIRECTION DID THIS AND YOU HAVE

00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:56.280
THREE DIFFERENT CRITERIA SO WE

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:56.881
JUST USE A CRITERIA THAT WAS

00:36:56.948 --> 00:36:57.782
AND THAT. WAS RIGHT EXCEPT

00:36:57.848 --> 00:36:58.916
EXCEPT I WHAT I SEE MISSING

00:36:58.983 --> 00:36:59.817
HERE ALTHOUGH IT YOUR TESTIMONY

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:00.618
SAYING IT WHY DON'T SEE. IS THE

00:37:00.685 --> 00:37:02.386
DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR. TRANSFER IS

00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:04.822
SAYING IF WE IF WE WERE TO PUT

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.691
THE FENCE LINE MONITORING IN AT

00:37:06.757 --> 00:37:07.592
OUR FACILITY. WOULD COST US A

00:37:07.658 --> 00:37:09.527
MILLION DOLLARS. IN WE'RE GOING

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:14.031
TO PUT A MILLION DOLLARS. INTO

00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:18.336
REDUCTION OF. CO TWO OR

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:19.937
WHATEVER NEW EQUIPMENT SO THAT

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:20.972
THE YEAR DISTRICT COULD SAY

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:22.540
OKAY WEEK WE CAN GO BY AND WE

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:23.407
JOIN OUR OWN MONITORING. IT

00:37:23.474 --> 00:37:25.076
DOES IT'S WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU

00:37:25.142 --> 00:37:26.611
SOME GUIDANCE IF WE BECAUSE WE

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:28.713
WANT TO REWARD GOOD BEHAVIOR

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:29.747
WE'RE GONNA REWORK COULD BE

00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:31.115
DIFFERENCE OKAY IF YOU'RE GOING

00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:32.183
TO GO IN AND- CLEANUP YOUR

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.718
SMALL FACILITIES MEDIUM SIZE

00:37:33.784 --> 00:37:35.286
FOR SELL THESE. BIG FACILITIES

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:36.387
WE'LL GIVE YOU A DOLLAR FOR

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:38.055
DOLLAR YOU KNOW TRANSFER

00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:38.656
BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW MUCH THE

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:39.690
MONSTERS GO BECAUSE THEY KNOW

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:41.258
MUCH. THE CLEANING THAT'S NOT

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:43.194
HERE BEFORE US THIS IS JUST TO

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.929
SAY WERE SMALL WE WANT TO

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:47.632
PROTECT YOU BUT- AGAIN YOU'RE

00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:49.834
NOT UNDER OATH AND I I'M NOT

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:50.768
SUGGESTING THAT YOU'RE NOT.

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:52.303
YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE COMPANIES.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:53.971
COMPANIES I COULD DO BUT

00:37:54.038 --> 00:37:55.306
THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER A LOT OF

00:37:55.373 --> 00:37:58.476
LITTLE. REFINING OUR PROCESSORS

00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:01.212
IN THIS IN THIS KERN COUNTY AND

00:38:01.278 --> 00:38:03.547
ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE. THAT

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:05.316
ARE GOING TO BE BENEFITING FROM

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:07.718
THIS THERE'S TWO. NOW AND WE

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:09.553
ARE ACTUALLY THERE AREN'T OTHER

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:10.988
FACILITIES IT'S VERY LIMITED

00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:12.490
NOT FIGHT THE DISTRICT ISSUE

00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:13.557
WHERE KERN IS THE ONE THAT

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:14.725
ISN'T A BENEFICIARY OF A

00:38:14.792 --> 00:38:16.527
CURRENT EXEMPTION. AND SO THIS

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:18.429
WOULD THIS WOULD HELP US AND

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:19.363
GET US TO HAVE THAT PEOPLE

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.732
TREATMENT. AND YOU KNOW AT THE

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:24.568
END OF THE DAY I THINK IF THE

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:25.936
AUTHOR OF THE BILL HAD

00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:28.072
INTENDED. FOR REFINERIES LIKE

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.106
KERN HAD ATTENDED FOR SMALL

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:30.941
FACILITIES IF THAT'S WHAT. THE

00:38:31.008 --> 00:38:32.877
SUPPORT FOR THE BILL SAID CAN

00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:34.512
WE WOULD BE HAVING A VERY

00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:35.513
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION RIGHT

00:38:35.579 --> 00:38:36.580
AND I AGREE WITH YOU SPEND THE

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:38.416
FIX REALLY WOULD BE DOING IT

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.351
THROUGH THE LOCAL DISTRICT ARE

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:41.686
TRYING TO GET. MORE TIME OR

00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:43.521
SOME CLARITY. BUT BECAUSE THE

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:45.456
DIRECTION THAT WE GOT WAS. WE

00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:46.791
WERE NOT THE INTENDED TARGET

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:48.325
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AT A

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:55.533
FACILITY LIKE UP. THAT'S WHY.

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:56.100
EXEMPTION SEEMS APPROPRIATE

00:38:56.167 --> 00:39:00.037
ENOUGH AND STUFF. I FEEL

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:02.473
UNCOMFORTABLE. GIVEN THE DESIRE

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.874
TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY FOR ALL

00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:04.975
THE CITIZENS ARE KERN COUNTY

00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:06.243
THIS TIME GIVEN I GUESS THE

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.345
LACK OF EFFORT BY THE AIR

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:10.181
DISTRICT I GUESS I GUESS IF

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:14.085
IT'S ONE THING FOR LEGISLATORS

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:18.522
AND THE. THE COVERED ENTITIES

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:19.523
BUT THIS IS WHAT THIRD THIS IS

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.492
WHAT YOUR JOB IS TO PROVIDE THE

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:22.727
GUIDANCE ITS THAT'S CLEARLY

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:24.595
SAID AND L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G AND LANGUAGE SO&lt;/c&gt;

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:25.763
WELL AND I THINK FROM OUR

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.264
PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:28.666
OUR AIR POLLUTION DISTRICT HAS

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.267
A LOT ON HIS PLATE THERE ARE A

00:39:30.334 --> 00:39:30.968
LOT OF THINGS THAT IT'S

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:31.802
PURSUING THERE'S A OT OF

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:33.003
THINGS THAT IT'S DOING. AND

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.305
FRANKLY WE WOULD RATHER HAVE

00:39:34.371 --> 00:39:35.639
THEM SPENDING THEIR TIME ON

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:37.141
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:38.275
GONNA HAVE A BENEFICIAL IMPACT

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:40.544
ON OUR COMMUNITY AND SO THAT'S

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:41.812
WHERE I'M BECAUSE WE THINK THE

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:43.514
LACK OF CLARITY IS AT THIS

00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:44.615
LEVEL THAT THIS IS THE

00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:46.117
APPROPRIATE LEVEL TO. TO

00:39:46.183 --> 00:39:47.918
CLARIFY INTO THE CHAIR AND SIR

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:49.086
THERE'S ONLY TWO I THOUGHT

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:50.621
THERE ARE THERE'S ONLY ONE KERN

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:51.722
IS THE ONLY ONE I THOUGHT THEY

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:53.357
WERE TOO BUT THERE'S NOT KERN

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:54.892
IS THE ONLY DID THE ONLY ROOF

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:57.595
SMALL REFINER. AND THAT MEETS

00:39:57.661 --> 00:40:00.965
THIS CRITERIA AND THAT IS NOT

00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:04.368
IN A URBAN FULLY DEVELOPED IN

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:08.239
GOAL CITY AREA. IT'S THE ONLY

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:14.245
ONE. THAT MEETS THIS CRITERIA.

00:40:14.311 --> 00:40:14.879
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING THERE IS

00:40:14.945 --> 00:40:16.013
THERE'S NO SENSE THERE THERE

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.680
ISN'T CITIES YOU'RE SAYING THE

00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:18.249
ONLY AND NOT AND THE LANGUAGES

00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:19.984
CRAFTED WRESTLING INTO CRAFTED

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.920
IS VERY NARROW THIS BILL

00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:25.856
AFFECTS CURRENT OIL REFINERY.

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:27.124
THE STATE'S IS THE STAFF IS NOT

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:27.825
BEEN ABLE TO DEFINITIVELY

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:31.762
VERIFY THAT CLAIM. AN ANALYSIS.

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:33.097

THAT THE WEIGHT YEAH I JUST

00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:35.666
LACK OF TIME TO SIR IS WHAT I

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:39.136
WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU. AND AT

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:50.714
THE CENTER. SO I'M- ONE OF THE

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:55.219
THINGS IT'S A. IS THAT A

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.154
PROBLEM FOR ME IN THIS

00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:57.721
LEGISLATURE IS THE ONE SIZE

00:40:57.788 --> 00:41:00.991
FITS ALL. NEVER WORKS FOR MY

00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:01.859
LITTLE SMALL BUSINESS EITHER I

THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL I THINK

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:10.267
THERE. IS SOMETHING THAT THE

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:11.569
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TAKE A LOOK

00:41:11.635 --> 00:41:12.169
AT IS THAT THERE ARE

00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:14.138

WE SHOULD BE. TRYING TO. HELP

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:19.410
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS

00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:22.813
LEGISLATION IS GONNA. CHANGE

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.447
THE AIR QUALITY THERE I WANT TO

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:26.584
SAY THAT I. THE THAT I THINK

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:27.852
THAT YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT

00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:29.453
