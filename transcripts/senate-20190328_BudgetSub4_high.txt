GO AHEAD THANK YOU -- THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER IS EXPECTED TO NEARLY DOUBLE AND REACH ALMOST NINE MILLION BY. TWENTY THIRTY WHICH WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CARE GIVERS. WELL CHILD CARE WORKER-EMPLOYMENT IS GROWINGSLOWLY AND THE NUMBER OF HOME HEALTH AIDES HAS RECENTLY SHRUNK. THE RANKS OF PERSONAL CARE AIDES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE RISEN DRAMATICALLY TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO RISE BY ALMOST 35% A YEAR. THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THE CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE MEDIAN ANNUAL SALARY FOR PERSONAL CARE AIDES. IS 260-002-0020 DOLLARS ABOUT ELEVEN DOLLARS AND FORTY ONE CENTS AN HOUR. TO THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND SIX CENTS AN HOUR HOME CARE. EIGHT I'D LIKE TO NOW SEGUE INTO. HOW THE STATE WHAT THE STATE'S ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE DOMESTIC WORKERS BILL OF RIGHTS? OUR LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE CONDUCTED A STATEWIDE REVIEW OF CLAIMS IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN TO IN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WAS AN OVERALL STEADY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF WAGE CLAIMS FILED WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER BY DOMESTIC WORKERS. THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS IN OUR SYSTEM FOR HOW WE CATEGORIZE THOSE SO WE DO URGE SOME CAUTION. BUT ROUGHLY WE FOUND IN THAT TIME PERIOD ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED CLAIMS FELL WITHIN THE CRITERIA THAT WE THINK ARE IDENTIFIED AS A DOMESTIC WORKER. IN OUR EVALUATION OF THOSE CLAIMS WE FOUND THAT WORKERS REPORTED AN AVERAGE HOURLY WAGE OF THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY FOUR CENTS. AND THE MEDIAN WAS ELEVEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS. IN THE YEARS THAT WE EXAMINE THOSE. ROUGHLY FOUR AND FIVE WORKERS REPORTED HOURLY WAGES AT WORK SEEDING THE MINIMUM WAGE. HOWEVER ONE IN TEN REPORTED. THAT THEY RECEIVE LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE. WITH MINIMAL HAVING ANY OF THEIR CLAIMS RELATED TO OVER TIME. HOWEVER WE DO URGE CAUTION WHEN LOOKING AT THOSE STATISTICS THERE ARE MANY BARRIERS THAT PREVENT US FROM UNDERSTANDING THE TRUE NATURE OF THE DATA. THEY'RE ALSO BARRIERS TO ENFORCEMENT [inaudible] I'M. IT IS DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING FOR OUR FIELD ENFORCEMENT -- TO ENTER THE PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE THAT IS OFTEN A CLIENT'S HOME AND WE TYPICALLY ENTER WORKPLACES -- THAT ARE NOT THAT ARE NOT HOMES AND THAT HAVE. A LARGER SET SET OF WORKERS. THERE ARE ALSO CONSTRAINTS AND BARRIERS THAT WE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHERE WORKERS MAY BE HESITANT TO BRING A CLAIM. THERE IS FEAR OF LOSS OF JOBS AND OR BENEFITS SUCH AS ROOM AND BOARD. THERE IS A LEGAL COMPLEXITY SOME OF THESE CLAIMS. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL CHANGES IN STATE FEDERAL IN CASE LAW THAT HAVE IMPACTED THIS GROUP OF WORKERS MAKING MAKING IT CHALLENGING WE THINK FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE. IN TERMS OF EARLY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GOING FORWARD. OUR STAFF ARE CONDUCTING A SURVEY TO OBTAIN STAKEHOLDER AND PUT ON OUR REGION EDUCATION RECOMMENDATIONS. SOME OF THE RESPONDENTS INCLUDE MEMBERS OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WERE REGIONAL. INITIALLY REQUIRED AND PARTICIPATED -- UNDER THE VISOR ADVISORY COMMITTEE REQUIRED UNDER THE INITIAL DOMESTIC WORKERS BILL OF RIGHTS PURSUANT TO LABOR CODE SECTION. FOURTEEN FIFTY TWO WE HOPE TO PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILS THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY AND MORE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS WHEN WE SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN JULY. I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP THE FLOOR IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WELL FIRST THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR MAKING THAT EFFORT TO REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THE FULL REPORT.

GOOD MORNING ONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE -- WANTED TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT FAMILY PROGRAM OF COURSE THIS IS -- GOT A LOT OF IDENTIFYING. COURSE IT'S GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION RECENTLY PARTICULARLY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS DESIRE TO IMPROVE. THE PROGRAM. I'M SORRY COULD YOU INTO DO SO OF APOLOGIZE -- CENTER ON PATRICK HEAD AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT -- WE HAVE OVERSIGHT OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT DIVISIONS INCLUDING -- THE STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM -- WHICH IS -- PART OF ACTUALLY THE A PARENT OF A CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM -- RENEE GIPSON -- IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR. OF EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT IN CHARGE OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE AND SHE'S HERE TODAY IF THERE'S ANY TACTICAL. TYPICALLY ENSURE THAT I BUT SINCE THE PROGRAM STARTED -- IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WAS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION BY THEN SENATOR -- KEWL -- THAT STARTED THIS PROGRAM -- CALIFORNIA -- THE PROGRAM IS COVERED OVER EIGHTEEN POINT ONE MILLION CALIFORNIA WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S FUNDED BY A 1% ABOUT 1% IT FLUCTUATES TAX ON EMPLOYEES THIS IS AN ENTIRELY EMPLOYEE FUNDED PROGRAM -- IT'S NOT JUST PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS PAID BY THAT IT IS PAID -- THAT -- 1% ALSO PAYS FOR STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE -- WHICH IS THERE -- FOR WELL WHEN OTHER INJURED ON OUTSIDE. OF THEIR WORK RESPONSIBILITIES. LAST YEAR -- IT'S SERVED OVER US. TWO MILLION -- THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS -- PROVIDING ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN BENEFITS TO THOSE WORKERS PRIMARILY IT'S PROGRAM HAS BEEN USE -- FOR BONDING. BUT IT ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO BE USED FOR CARE -- PARTICULARLY AS OUR POPULATION IS AGING -- WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS CARE -- FOR THE USE OF THAT BENEFIT FOR CARE GO UP -- AS OF A LACK ACTUALLY AS OF THIS COMING YEAR -- WILL ALSO BE EXTENDING THE BENEFIT. TO FOLKS FOR WHAT'S CALLED EXIGENCY -- WHICH ALLOWS -- THE FAMILY OF OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN -- TO RECEIVE SOME TIME AWAY FROM WORK. A TO TAKE CARE FAMILY AND THE HELP OF PREPARE. OTHER LOVE ONE FOR SERVICE -- VOTE WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE THIS PROGRAM -- OUT OF FRESNO OFFICE. WHICH HELPS US OUT AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS -- IT IS -- PARTIAL WAGE REPLACEMENT OF UP THAT OF OF FORMER ASSEMBLY MAN -- PASTOR A COUPLE YEARS BACK -- BUT ALLOWS FOR UP -- TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS -- FOR WORKERS -- A WEEK. ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. HI MARC MINUTES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AS DIRECTOR AND STATED CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM ALLOWS WORKERS TO TAKE UP TO SIX WEEKS OF PAID. LEAVE ANNUALLY TO CARE FOR A SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY MEMBER OR TO FIND A NEW BORN OR KNOW THE ADOPTED CHILD. WITH CURRENT WAGE REPLACEMENT OF UP 270% OF SALARY BASED ON INCOME LEVEL -- SO THE PROGRAM WHICH IS A COMPONENT OF THE STATE'S DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM SUPPORTS CHILD DEVELOPMENT IN THE CRITICAL FIRST WEEKS. OF OF LIFE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PROVIDING UP TO SIX MONTHS. OF PAID PARENTAL LEAVE TO BOND WITH A NEW CHILD LEADS TO POSITIVE HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN. GREATER ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR PARENTS. AND LESS STRAIN ON FINDING AND AFFORDING INFANT CHILD CARE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO EXPANDING THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT ALL NEWBORNS AND NEWLY ADOPTED BABIES CAN BE CARED FOR BY A PARENT OR CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER. OR UP TO SIX FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS I'M IN THE SHORT TERM THE ADMINISTRATION. PROPOSES JUST THE PRESERVE REQUIREMENT FOR THE FIND THAT SUPPORTS FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM THIS CHANGE WILL ENABLE THE STATE. TO MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT AND EXPANDING. THE PROGRAM IN THE UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR. WHILE MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE RESERVE. OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONVENE A TASK FORCE. TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO PHASE IN AND EXPAND THE PROGRAM THIS TASK FORCE -- WILL CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS AS COSTS. FUNDING SOURCES IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE IN OTHER RECENT LEGISLATION LIKE A. B. NINE AWAY. I'M IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONSIDER OTHER CHANGES INCLUDING THE ALIGNMENT OF EXISTING WORKER PROTECTIONS AND NON RETALIATION PROTECTIONS TO INCREASE THE ABILITY OF ALL WORKERS TO ACCESS THESE IMPORTANT BENEFITS -- FINALLY I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED. BOB BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE YES. THANK YOU CHAD DOWNLOAD THE LATEST BATTLE IS OFFICE I'M WE JUST WANT TO POINT OUT SORT OF A FEW REMARKS -- THE THE GOVERNOR AND AND AS MR MEN AS MENTIONED HAS MADE THE THE FOCUS OF THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND IT FAMILY LEAVE. THE IMPROVEMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT ON N. AS A WAY TO SORT OF ADDRESS THAT GOAL PARTICULAR THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS AT LEAST CONCEPTUALLY PROPOSED AT THIS POINT. TWO LENGTH AND DURATION OF LEAVE. AND MAKE POTENTIAL CHANGES TO ALLOW LEAVE TO BE TAKEN MORE FLEXIBLY SO SHARE ABILITY -- AND OTHER CHANGES FROM CURRENT LAW. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS WE WOULD POINT OUT AS THE SUB COMMITTEE CONSIDERS -- THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND PAID FAMILY LEAVE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IS THAT IT IT THINK ABOUT WHAT. ITS OWN GOALS FOR THE EXPANSION MIGHT BE -- OTHERS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALTERNATIVE CALL SUCH AS ADDRESSING HOT MATERNAL HEALTH FOR REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF POST PARTUM DEPRESSION. OR POTENTIALLY -- GOALS RELATED TO LABOR MARKET OUTCOME ADDRESSING THAT THE GENDER GAP IN LABOR MARKET PARTICIPATION. WHERE IS THIS POINT BECAUSE? THAT THE GOALS THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY IDENTIFIES AS PRIORITIES FOR THE PROGRAM SHOULD DICTATE WHAT CHANGES IT PURSUITS ARM. SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO TAKE. A FAMILY LEAVE TO BOND WITH A NEW CHILD -- AT THIS POINT WE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT HALF OF NEW MOTHERS. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM? TAKE PART IN IT AND ABOUT A QUARTER OF NEW FATHERS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TAKE PART SO THERE ARE SOME PARTICIPATION QUESTIONS. IF THE LEGISLATORS INTEREST IS AN INCREASING THAT TAKE UP RATE. WE WOULD POINT OUT THAT. ONE THING THE DURATION OF LEAVE ITSELF MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLICY TO GET YOU THERE -- ALTERNATIVELY IF TAKE UP IS THE THE PRIMARY GOALS JUST AS AN EXAMPLE -- LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AT THE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE FOR ALL WORKERS ARE POTENTIALLY TARGETED FOR CERTAIN WORKERS -- EXPANDING OUTREACH EFFORTS. TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE PROGRAM AND MAYBE ALSO LOOKING AT THE THE LEGAL JOB PROTECTIONS THAT THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS ENSURING THAT THOSE ARE BOTH IN LAW AND IN PRACTICE. ALLOWING PARENTS TO TAKE THAT LEAVE TIME [inaudible] I'M. IN ADDITION OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS THE ONLY OTHER POINT WE WOULD RAISE IS THAT -- IN  RECENT REPORT WE'VE WE WORKED ON WE WANTED TO GET A SENSE OF THREAT PROVIDE SOME THINKING FILLED THE SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO GO ABOUT IT ACTUALLY. FUNDING EXPANDED WE'VE BEEN AFFECTS THE MINISTRATION IS. PROPOSING A TASK FORCE TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES BUT TO SORT OF THE STARTING PLACE. ON WE HAVEN'T SCORED A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A SPECIFIC -- PROPOSAL TO LOOK AT YET BUT WE THOUGHT MORE BROADLY I'M. THINKING OF THE CURRENT FINANCING STRUCTURE THE PAYROLL TAX AND AND THE BENEFIT STRUCTURE. UNDER STATE LAW THE PAYROLL TAX AS DIRECTOR ANY MENTION FLUCTUATES UPWARD OR DOWNWARD TO BALANCE THE FUND -- BUT IT'S CAPPED AT ONE POINT 5% OF A ROLE TAX. AND SO ON CURRENTLY IT'S ABOUT WE SAID WELL BY HOW MUCH COULD BENEFITS BE EXPANDED IN DOLLAR TERMS. IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHILE STAYING UNDER THE ONE POINT 5%. YES JUST ONE QUESTION SIR BEFORE YOU GO FORWARD OF COURSE BUT WITH REGARDS TO THE ONE ISN'T THERE OF MAX ON THEIR EARNINGS. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ALL EARNING THAT THAT'S RIGHT RECORD YOUNG EXPLAINED THAT THE CURRENT PAYROLL TAX IS PLAYED BY COVERED EMPLOYERS AT 1% OF THEIR WAGES. UP TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR -- SO PLEASE EXCUSE ME. PARDON ME THANK YOU -- EMPLOYEES PAY A PAYROLL TAX UP TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THAT INCREASES EACH YEAR MORE OR LESS WITH THE RATE OF WAGE INFLATION -- BUT BEYOND THAT AMOUNT EMPLOYEES NOT A PAYROLL TAX. OKAY. I'M. SO I THINK THEY DON'T PAY OR DOES THE IT'LL BE ON THE EARNINGS ABOVE THAT AMOUNT SO% JUST ON THE BASE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IMAGES -- IN THINKING ABOUT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE -- WITH -- RAN SOME SCENARIOS AND OBVIOUSLY SUBJECT TO SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT WE THINK. THAT PAYROLL TAXES ON THAT EMPLOYEES PAY COULD BE INCREASED. UNDER THE EXISTING STRUCTURE -- BY AT LEAST A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND BUT NOT LIKELY MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS. TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS. OP WITHOUT. GOING ABOVE THE ONE POINT 5% CAP. AND SO THIS WE THINK IS A HELPFUL MARKER OF AND HOW HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT. THE MONEY IS IT TOO COMPLICATED NO IT'S THE FUNDING SYSTEM IS IS COMPLEX -- BUT IS DESIGNED TO BASICALLY CALCULATE THE PAYROLL TAX RATE THAT IS NECESSARY TO GENERATE CONTRIBUTIONS. THAT WOULD BALANCE OUT THE AMOUNT THAT'S WOOD IS ESTIMATED TO GO OUT AND BENEFITS SO IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE OR THE GOVERNOR IN THIS INSTANCE. IF THEY WERE TO EXPAND BENEFITS. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS WOULD GO OUT AND IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR THE AUTOMATIC FORMULA WITH RECALCULATE WHAT THE PAYROLL TAX RATE. ESTIMATED NEED TO BE TO GENERATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO COVER THOSE BENEFITS SO THERE'S A SORT OF CIRCULAR. A SELF ADJUSTING MECHANISM I'M. WE THINK THE ONE BILLION TWO TWO BILLION DOLLAR MARK IS A HELPFUL BENCHMARK BECAUSE AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED CURRENTLY PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS FOR ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SORT OF GIVE YOU. AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. I'M A COUPLE POINTS. BEFORE SIR FINISHING UP HERE THAT WE WOULD MAKE OUR FIRST. ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT ARE PROVIDED. WOULD BE WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER PAYROLL TAXES FOR WORKERS THAT THE PAY INTO THE TO THE FUND -- AND SECONDLY GOING BEYOND THAT ONE TO TWO BILLION DOLLAR RANGE EXPANDED BENEFITS WOULD REQUIRE THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY. OTHER FUNDING SOURCES. THANKS. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS HERE A QUICK QUESTION NUMBER OF THERE'S A PROCESS QUESTION FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU RECTOR HANDING CERTAINLY IS IT IS IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS THAT. WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED THE NECESSARY FUNDING SOURCES OF WHEN WHEN THIS COME BACK TO US WHEN YOU TO SPITTLE COME BACK TO US. SENATOR REID IN SOME WAY I THINK OF THE TO HARM TO FINANCE FOR SOME OF THAT -- TO AVOID THE HARD TO BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. I THINK THIS GOVERNMENT IS MOVING PROGRESSIVELY AND I THINK YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING THIS YEAR I THINK IT'S FAIR -- A WELL I GUESS JUST TO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD -- A WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF THE THE ROLE THAT AT THIS TIME -- BUT WERE -- WERE MAGICALLY THE TASK FORCE SHOULD BE CAN BEING SEEN IN OVER THE NEXT YEAR. SOLD. OKAY SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS UNTIL NEXT YEAR IS THAT WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE. AGAIN I HAVE A I THINK THAT'S SAD. I CAN'T CONFIRM WHETHER IT'LL BE -- NEXT YEAR UNDER THE SUN I I'M NOT -- TO I'M NOT WRITING IN MY CAL. I'M TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF IDEA JUST ROUGHLY WHEN YOU THINK THIS WILL COME BACK TO US. YOU KNOW GIVE OR TAKE A YEAR. I'D SAY YEAH I'M I CAN'T REALLY SAY YEAH I I ONLY HAVE THREE MORE YEARS ON THIS TERM SO. OKAY ALL RIGHT [inaudible] SENATOR NIELSEN. WELL THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT. BECAUSE EVEN THE CAP CAN BE CHANGED. AND I TRUST THIS WILL BE AFFECTED IN THE TRAILER BILL CORRECT. IS THAT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. SENATE RIGHT I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE MECHANISM THAT THEY'LL USE I BELIEVE THAT -- THIS'LL HAPPEN THAT WE HAVE THE SORT OF NORTH STAR. OF THE SIX MONTHS AS PART OF THE FINEST CORRECTLY POINTS OUT. I KNOW THAT THAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL I THINK THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THIS IN AN APPROPRIATE FASHION TO SIT DOWN WITH. A CONVENING OF EXPERTS ON THIS ISSUE. BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF IT BEING A WORKER BENEFIT -- AND KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN TO MAKE SURE THAT -- AND A LOT OF THE RACES THAT -- WE HAVE FROM THE LA -- I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WANTS TO MOVE SMARTLY ON THIS ISSUE -- SO THE EXACT VEHICLE IT WOULD BE HARD FOR ME TO SEND. THE FINEST YOU GUYS KNOW EXACTLY AYE AYE I DON'T KNOW. THEY COULDN'T POSSIBLY BUT THAT'S IMPORTANT POINT. IT IS A MAJOR POLICY. CERTAINLY WITH MERIT BUT WE CAN'T BE DONE BLANK CHECKS. AND IF GOING TO BE AFFECTED THIS YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME ACTION TAKEN. BY THE BUDGET IN THE BUDGET. AND ONE MAN ANOTHER COULD BE IN THE OVERALL BUDGET TELL FOR COULD BE IN. AND THE IMPORTANT POINT THEN IS THAT. THIS CAN'T BE JUST INTERJECTED LATER AFTER THE MAY REVISE. AND OR DONE IN A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. BECAUSE THERE'S ALMOST NO PUBLIC INPUT. AND LITTLE KNOWLEDGE. TO THE PUBLIC OR EVEN TO THE MEMBERS. AT THAT TIME SO I WOULD ENTREAT THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE AS EXPEDITIOUS AS THEY CAN AS TO THIS YEAR'S PLAN. AND NOT JUST SAY WELL WE'RE GONNA BET ON THE COMMON WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT YEAR THAT'S A MAJOR POLICY DID YOU PUT INTO EFFECT BUT YOU'RE NOT. HAVING ANY CONTROLS OR ABILITY TO ASSESS WE NEED TO BE ABLE ABILITY STE. APPOINTMENT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE GOVERNOR'S INTENT IS TO INVOLVE THE LEGISLATURE -- THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS JANA AND I'M SURE YOU WOULD MISTER HANDING YOUR THAT IS YOUR REPUTATION SO I HAVE NO FEAR BUT IT'S A QUESTION THAT -- SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF HOW THE BUDGET PROCESS IS UNFORTUNATELY CHANGE THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS. THE KEY POINTS THAT YOU MAKE -- ANALYST OR HELPFUL TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE THAT THOSE ARE THE KIND OF A ROAD MAP. AND THAT WE NEED TO BE RESPECTFUL AND AS I FOLLOW THIS THROUGH THE PROCESS THEN NAVI BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT THAT. DIFFERENT SPOTS ALONG THE WAY. IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE IN THE SUB MAYBE IN THE STATE IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE OF COURSE HERE BUT ALSO WAS THE BUDGET -- INVOLVED AND GOES THROUGH CONFERENCE AND TO THE END. I HAVE A THANK YOU SENATOR OF THE I HAVE A QUESTION -- MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE IT ALL TODAY. MR HANDING WITH REGARDS TO A. B. NINE NO NINE OH WAIT I KNOW OR OR A REPORT. WILL BE DO BU THAT'S NOT FOR A COUPLE YEARS RIGHT -- I'M JUST WONDERING DO YOU HAVE ANY PRELIMINARY INFORMATION -- ABOUT THESE. YEAH CAN YOU KNOW THE INCOME CATEGORIES LIKE WHO'S WHO'S. A ADVANTAGE OF THE BENEFITS AS THAT EXIST WITHIN WHAT INCOME CATEGORIES -- SENATOR WITH WE DO WITH THAT AND APOLOGIZE FOR STUFF IN IT BUT IF IF THERE'S MORE THAT I NEED ANSWERED PLEASE LET ME KNOW. THE LA WAS REPORT IS ACTUALLY VERY GOOD WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING A LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE INCOME LEVELS AND SOME OF THE EXACT DEMOGRAPHIC SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE EXACT REPORT THAT YOU'RE REFERRING -- TO THE DEPARTMENT HAS COMPLETED IT'S A I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT I THINK IT'S JUST A MATTER OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION MAKING SURE THAT IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS. CORRECTLY -- BUT THAT TYPE OF DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW SO FAR AS A UTILIZATION RATES -- MEN WOMEN A NEW FATHERS -- I WAS ACTUALLY HAPPY TO SEE THAT -- OUT OF A SMALL A BIT OF MONEY IT WAS SMALL IN THE SENSE OF THE LARGESS OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED ABOUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TO DO AN OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO TRY TO GET THE UTILIZATION RATE UP. WE EXPENDED THOSE FUNDS -- AND JUST FINISHED WITH THAT AND WHAT I'D SAY IS -- WHAT I WAS PARTICULARLY PROUD OF? IS THAT FATHERS WE TARGETED THAT GROUP -- THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN USING THIS PROGRAM AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE. TO TRY TO GET THOSE NUMBERS UP THOSE CAME UP. WHEN IT CAME TO LATINO POPULATIONS IN AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATIONS WE ALSO SAW THE SLIDE UP TO BECAUSE WELL THEIR? OVERALL OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE SENATE SEEN A 10% INCREASE IN THE UTILIZATION OF THE PROGRAM. THAT I BELIEVE IS IN PART -- THE RESULT. OF THAT OUTREACH PROGRAM -- BUT IF THERE'S ANY DEMOGRAPHIC DATA DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. MY DEPARTMENT IS MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE OKAY GREAT I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO PUT IN. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT EXPLICIT IN THE LAW OR IN THE PRACTICES OF DISCRIMINATORY. INTENT BUT THERE COULD BE A DISCRIMINATORY AFFECT -- SOMEONE THROUGHOUT AN OF STATISTIC TO ME THAT TO BE LIKE 40% OF LOW INCOME WORKERS PUT IN BUT DON'T LOW INCOME WORKERS SO. THERE MAY BE AN UPTAKE OF 10% QUESTION IS WHO'S REALLY UTILIZING THAT -- AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME GETTING NOT ALLOW YOU. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM UP TO BE ABLE. TO STAY WITH YOUR FAMILY TO BE ABLE TO HELP -- WITH WHATEVER A USE IS -- IS NEEDED SO THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ME BECAUSE IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO REACH. THOSE FAMILIES AND THOSE CHILDREN ALL WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE IN SUCH A WAY SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF WHAT I'M THINKING IS CORRECT INSTEAD OF EXTENDING OR NOT IS INSTEAD OF BUT WE REALLY NEED TO DEAL WITH THE WAGE REPLACEMENT PERCENTAGE OF WAGE REPLACEMENT. AND THAT LIKE I SAID THE 6270% OF MINIMUM WAGE. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY DO THAT SO? THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IF YOU HAVE. PLEASE SHARE SENATOR AND IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE OTHERS ON MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE OF DIRECTLY WITH THE OFFICE RIGHT CAN REPORT TO THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. WHICH IP FOR OKAY. PUBLIC COMMENT ON OF THIS ISSUE PLEASE. THANK YOU. HELLO SENATORS MY NAME IS DANYA CASSIDY AND I'M WITH THAT CALIFORNIA WORKING FAMILY COALITION AND WE WERE THE COALITION THAT HELP PASSED THE FIRST LINE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS. ISSUE FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS AND WE REPRESENT A WIDE VARIETY OF GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE AND WE'RE VERY MUCH IN. AGREEMENT WITH THE COMMENTS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE WANT TO EXPAND THIS LAW WE DEFINITELY NEED THE JOB PROTECTION BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE BEING THREATENED WITH THEIR JOBS WE NEED ADEQUATE REYES WAGE REPLACEMENT OR LOW INCOME PEOPLE SO CAN TAKE IT. WE NEED AN EDUCATION OUTREACH PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON LOW INCOME NEW IMMIGRANT LOS ANGELES COUNTY FRESNO CARE GIVERS. THE WIDE VARIETY PEOPLE THEY COULD TAKE A BECAUSE THIS REALLY NEEDS TO WORK FOR DIVERSE FAMILIES THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHARTER RAZA MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY -- STATE THAT WE VERY MUCH DO SUPPORT EXPANDING THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TOOUR HEARTS WE SPONSOR THE LEGISLATION THAT CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT THE BENEFITS OF JUST BEEN INCALCULABLE TO WORKERS. AND EMPLOYERS THAT WE DO THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. DOES IN THE END MEAN REDUCED TURNOVER IMPROVE JOB SATISFACTION AND DIRECT COST SAVINGS FOR A LOT OF EMPLOYERS OUT THERE. AND HOPEFULLY THROUGH THIS RENEWED FOCUS ON THE PROGRAM WE CAN START TAKING A REAL HARD LOOK AT HOW WE FINANCE THE PROGRAM -- ESPECIALLY FOR TALKING ABOUT MAJOR EXPANSIONS IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THERE RIGHT NOW. THE PROGRAM IS FUNDED 1100% BY WORKER CONTRIBUTIONS AND THAT ARM WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW WE WANT TO BRING MORE BENEFITS TO WORKERS WE THINK I MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO CONSIDER THAT. THE PROGRAM DOES DIRECTLY BENEFIT EMPLOYERS AND THERE'S A LOT THAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE US LOOK MORE LIKE OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT DO HAVE MORE OF AN EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED WITH IS THAT THE D. I FUND AS IT STANDS NOW HAS BECOME. KIND OF A SAFETY NET FOR EMPLOYERS WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE WORKERS COMPENSATION WHERE. WE HAVE WORKERS WHO ARE HURT ON THE JOB OCCUPATIONAL INJURY THEY CAN'T WORK ANYMORE WHEN THEIR PLAYER FIGHTS THE CLAIM THEY HAVE TO GO ON THE DE I FIND GOING TO DE I TO ON TO STAY AFLOAT. AND AS A THE IDEA IS THAT THEN WHEN THE WORKERS CLAIMS FOUND TO BE WORK RELATED. THAT THE STATE THEN GOES BACK AND GETS THAT MONEY FROM THE EMPLOYER BUT OFTEN THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND AS A RESULT THERE'S WELL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS THAT. SHOULD BE IN THE FUND THAT ISN'T. THERE'S A SIMILAR ISSUE HAPPENING WITH UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WHERE IF THERE IS A RECESSION AND OUR SYSTEM IS CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED AS IT IS. THE THE LOANS THAT WE NEED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GENERATE A LOT OF INTEREST AND DURING THE LAST RECESSION. THE MONEY FOR THE GENERAL FUND WASN'T THERE AND SO THAT MONEY WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE D. I. FUND. ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THEN WENT TO GO PAY OFF THE INTEREST ON THE LOANS THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE FRANKLY EMPLOYERS UNDER FUND THE U. I. SYSTEM AND SO. IT HAS BECOME SORT OF A SAFETY NET FOR EMPLOYERS THAT WE THINK IS IS IRONIC GIVEN THAT IT'S ALL WORKER FUNDED AND SO -- MUSIC THERE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND WE LOOK FOR TO BEING A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. I'M SORRY I I WE NEED TO END THE MEETING SO IF YOU COULD JUST SAY QUICKLY YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION AND IT'S LIKE SUPPORTER DON'T OR I WOULD BE GLAD TO RECEIVE ON ANYTHING IN WRITING THAT YOU WOULD GIVE TO US THANK YOU. UNDERSTAND MY AND GRAHAM A CIO CALIFORNIA I LINE MY COMMENTS WITH THE WORK AND FAMILY COALITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
