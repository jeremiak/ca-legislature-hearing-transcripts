NOW MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM TWENTY FIVE CENTER MITCHELL WAS PREPARED MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE THIRTY NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE MON AN ACT RELATING TO CONSUMER LOANS. MITCHELL FOR JURORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT AB FIVE THREE NINE COLLEAGUES IS AN IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS YEARS OVERDUE. BECAUSE OF OUR LACKS LINDY LAWS EXTREMELY HIGH COST LOANS HAVE EXPLODED IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE PAST DECADE. THESE LOANS ARE OFFERED IN PAYDAY AND TITLE LOANS STORES AND OVER THE INTERNET WITH LOAN AMOUNTS STARTING AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO AVOID THE INTEREST RATE CAPS IN EXISTING LAW. THESE HIGH COST LOANS AT INTEREST RATES FROM ONE HUNDRED TO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PERCENT. AND FAR TOO OFTEN CONSUMERS ARE UNABLE TO REPAY THEM. IN FACT THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES CITED A STUDY COMMISSIONED BY HIGH COST LENDERS THAT FOUND THAT NEARLY 40% OF THEIR BORROWERS INTO IN COLLECTIONS. THIS PROCESS RESULT IN DAMAGE CREDIT RATING FOR THE CONSUMER AND CAN LEAD TO THEIR PAYCHECK BEING GARNISHED THEIR BANK ACCOUNT CLOSED OR THEIR CARS BE REPOSSESSED. THE AUTHORS OF THIS BILL HAVE WORKED HARD TO FIND A COMPROMISE THAT COULD EARN SUPORT FROM BOTH CONSUMER GROUPS AND REASONABLE LINDA IS A LIE. AND THIS BILL IS THE RESULT OF THOSE LONG NEGOTIATIONS. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY A STRONG COALITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT LABOR ORGANIZATIONS RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND VETERANS GROUPS TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT INCLUDING MY OWN BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AFTER SO ANY YEARS OF FAILED ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WE ASK YOU. TO ADVANCE THIS IMPORTANT POLICY THAT WILL BENEFIT BOTH CONSUMERS AND REASONABLE LENDERS ALIKE I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. MANY ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION DEBATE CENTER Y. COSTLY YES MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE THREE NINE AS A CO AUTHOR AND URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN STANDING UP FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS NO FOR TOO LONG A PREDATORY LENDERS HAVE HELD SWAY OVER THIS LEGISLATURE AND BLOCKED ATTEMPTS TO SET A RATE CAPS. THAT PROHIBITS THEM FROM CHARGING YOU SERVICE FEES FROM CONSUMERS WHEN I STARTED PRACTICING BANKRUPTCY LAW THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE CREDITORS FIRE SAY THROUGHPUT CHARGE 18% ON A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN. IN WE THOUGHT MY GOD IT'S BEYOND THAT TWELVE TO. KNOW ALL TOO WELL THAT THESE PREDATORY LOANS SOON TURNED INTO A MOUNTAIN OF DEBT THAT CAN NEVER BE REPAID RESULTING IN WAGE GARNISHMENT AND BANK LEVEES WHICH I'VE PERSONALLY SOUGHT. TO REIN IN ON MY OWN LEGISLATION I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS LONG OVERDUE PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH. THINK OF IT PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I TOO AM A CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE BECAUSE- THESE PROTECTIONS ARE SORELY NEEDED FOR ALL BORROWERS AND THAT SPECIFICALLY INCLUDES ARE VULNERABLE VETERANS. YOU KNOW FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS LENDERS FROM CHARGING MORE THAN 36% INTEREST TO ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE% FOUGHT VERY VERY HARD FOR THESE PROTECTIONS BECAUSE OUR SERVICE MEMBERS FRANKLY SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL STRESS PUT ON THEM BY CERTAIN LENDERS THIS BILL WILL ENSURE VETERANS AND ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTECTED FROM UNCONSCIONABLE FEES AND INTEREST RATES. WHICH CAN FRANKLY HAUNT THEM LONG AFTER THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT HAS BEEN PAID OFF SO PLEASE JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR DALLY. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I SAW THIS BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY VOTED FOR AND THEN I GOT PUT ON BAKING WHEN I GOT IN THE SENATE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE UNDER GREAT CHAIR BY THE WAY. THIS BILL BEEN AMENDED SOME I THINK THIS IS GOOD FOR CONSUMERS IT'S ABI SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND I KNOW THAT ARE A CAUCUS HOUSING OPPOSE ON THE BILL BUT I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IN MANY SITUATIONS SO I REGION I VOTE ON THIS BILL. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU I AM RISE IN A- OPPOSE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND- WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHERE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO GET CREDIT. IF YOU HAVE BAD CREDIT AND YOU HAVE. NOT FULFILLED YOUR OBLIGATIONS IN THE PAST OF PAYING YOUR BILLS. AND MAKING SURE THAT YOUR CREDIT IS GOOD. THEN YOU CAN'T JUST EXPECT. OF A IN A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO TAKE A RISK ON YOU WHEN YOU'RE A BAD RISK IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE WAY PEOPLE GET OUT OF THAT SITUATION IS THEY GET THE SHORT TERM LOANS AND YES THEY ARE A VERY HIGH INTEREST RATE BUT ONCE THEY GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. THEN THEY GO TO. A REGULAR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND THEY GO LOOK. I USED I HAD BAD CREDIT BUT OVER THE LAST YEAR I'VE MAINTAIN MY PAYMENTS. AT THIS HIGHER INTEREST RATE AND THE EASE BACK INTO THEIR CREDIT RATING SO THAT THEY CAN. ESTABLISH A GOOD CREDIT AGAIN. BUT TO REQUIRE OR CAT PEOPLE'S INTEREST RATES AND I REALIZE THAT THEY DO HAVE HIGH INTEREST RATES. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT. YOU IF YOU CAP IT ARE THEY REALLY GOING TO TAKE A RISK AND INVEST AND LET PEOPLE HAVE HIGH RISK LOANS. OUT THERE SO THEY CAN TRY TO RE ESTABLISH THEIR CREDIT. YOU'RE ASKING THE BANKS OR THEIR ASKING LENDING INSTITUTIONS ARE THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT LAND TO THESE. PARTICULAR PEOPLE THAT WANT. TO RE ESTABLISH THEIR CREDIT AFTER DESTROYING IT. FOR WHATEVER REASON. AND TO HAVE THAT TO HAVE THAT CAP AND NOT. AND NOT HAVE A LENDING INSTITUTION AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS CREDIT TO REBUILD THEIR CREDIT. IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WILL CAUSE A DETRIMENT TO HARM. TO THEM IN THE LONG TERM THE FUTURE MEYER J. NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR DORADO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I HEARD A LOT ABOUT THESE. A PAYDAY. LOANS AND DIDN'T HAVE A VERY FAVORABLE ATTITUDE BUT I DIDN'T THINK KIND OF THOUGHT THE WAY MY COLLEAGUE JUST DESCRIBED THAT. IT WAS AN OPPORTUNE FOR POOR PEOPLE TO GET ACCESS TO SOME MONEY BUT WHEN I SAW ACTUAL AGREEMENTS. COPIES OF AGREEMENTS. WHERE THEY HAD BORROWED TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS MAYBE AND IT WENT UP TO TEN AND TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO PAY BACK. I WAS FLOORED I WAS SHOCKED HOW COULD WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF POOR PEOPLE THAT WAY THAT MEANS THEY BECOME FOR EVER INDEBTED. AND THEY CAN'T KEEP UP AND THAT JUST SEEMED LIKE A COMPLETE ABUSE SO THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAKING A RISK AND COMPLETELY ABUSING OF POOR PEOPLE AND FORCING THEM TO STAY IN POVERTY FOR MANY MORE YEARS SO THAT'S FRANKLY WHAT CONVINCED ME TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. SENATE ALLEN. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT IS ONE OF ALSO MENTION THAT WE DID PUT IN THE SENATE FINANCIAL LITERACY IN THIS BILL SO THAT WE CAN EDUCATE THOSE FOLKS TO WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PAYING IN A CAPTIVE SO I WANTED TO BRING THAT POINT UP I THINK IT'S CRITICAL IT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING TO GET THAT THE LOANS NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN AND HOPEFULLY IN THE FUTURE WE WOULD TEACH THESE KIND OF THINGS IN SCHOOL WHERE THE COMPOUNDING INTEREST AS YOUR FRIEND IF YOU'RE SAVING MONEY AND IT YOUR ENEMY IF YOU'RE BORROWING MONEY NO TO THE THINGS. THAT PEOPLE TO BORROW MONEY NEEDED NO. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I WANT TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER HARD WORK ON IT THIS IS NOT AN EASY SPACE TO DO WORK IN AND THE REASON THAT IT'S NOT IS THAT WHILE WE MAY NOT LIKE THE INTEREST RATES THEY GET CHARGED THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT PEOPLE NEED ACCESS TO MONEY. AND THEY NEED A REGULATED INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO THAT MONEY OTHERWISE IF WE CLOSE OFF ALL THE ALTERNATIVES THEY END UP GOING TO AN UNREGULATED MARKET AND SO I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS I APPRECIATE THE COMPROMISES THAT WERE MADE AND I WOULD. ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL. THE BILL THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUES CENTER MATURE YOU MAY COSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT WE NOT. PAYING THAT NINETY THE K. ABOUT CREDIT. TO A SEARCH OR ASSUME THAT YOU CAN EARN CREDIT BY BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. BY SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO CHARGE YOU 2100% ON A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN IS JUST NOT THE CASE. HOW MANY OF US HERE ON THE FLOOR KNOW OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD. THE CREDIT THE INTEREST RATE YOU'RE PAYING ON YOUR HOME LOAN OR THE CREDIT CARDS IN YOUR BILL FOLDER PURSE. HOW MANY OF US HAVE BEEN LAID OR OUR DEBT RATIO IS INCREASED AND OUR INTEREST RATES HAVE INCREASED. HAD IT BEEN PROACTIVE ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT CREDIT COMPANY OR THAT LOAN HOLDER TO GET THAT INTEREST RATE DOWN AND HOW QUICKLY DID THAT INTEREST RATE DROPPED. SO TO SUGGEST THAT ONE OF THESE LOANS IS THE BEST WAY TO BUILD CREDIT I THINK IS NOT ACCURATE. IF THIS BILL PASSES WILL BORROWER STILL HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT. THE ANSWER IS YES LINDER THAT SUPPORT THE BILL ARE ALREADY SERVING THE MAJORITY BORROWS WHO CAN'T QUALIFY FOR CREDIT CARD OR BANK LOANS. THE AUTHOR HAS ALSO HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF LENDERS INTO HIS WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WHO STATED THAT THEY'LL RECONFIGURE TO COMPLY WITH THE BILL WHY. BECAUSE THEY ARE CLEAR THAT THERE IS A MARKET OUT THERE. LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET THAT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS DEFAULT IN HIGH COST LOANS EACH YEAR. THIS BILL WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE CREDIT OPTIONS IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE THEIR FINANCIAL WELL BEING IS NOT BEING RUINED BY ON AFFORDABLE LOANS. IN THE EVENT THAT NONE OF US HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE TO SECURE ONE OF THESE LOANS LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH A REAL LIFE SCENARIO. JUST SO WE'RE ALL CLEAR BEFORE WE CAST OUR VOTE. HEY UNNAMEDCAR TITLE LOAN COMPANY. GAVE A GENTLEMAN ALONE FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. WITH AN APR OF ONE HUNDRED AND 23% WITH A THIRTY FIVE MONTH TERM ON THE LOAN. BY THE END OF THE LONG TERM THE BORROWER WILL PAY EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE DOLLARS IN INTEREST. A TOTAL OF TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE DOLLARS TO BORROW TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED. THAT MAKES SENSE YOU THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE OR SAFE FOR OR SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD SIGN THE BOTTOM LINE WHEN YOU'RE BACK WAS AGAINST THE WALL AND YOU NEED TO TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE LOAN IS SECURED BY THE BORROWERS CAR. AND IN THE FINE PRINT OF THE CREDIT APPLICATION THEY ASK FOR A COPY OF THE BORROWERS CAR KEYS. THIS BORROWER WAS LURED INTO THE STORE WITH SIGNS THAT SAID THEY SPEAK SPANISH HOWEVER NO EMPLOYEES SPOKE SPANISH AND THEY GAVE HIM THE LOAN DOCUMENTS ALL IN ENGLISH. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF SCENARIOS THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO. ADDRESS. I FOR ONE WOULD NEVER WANT A CONSTITUENT OF MINE OR FAMILY MEMBER TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF WHEN THEY WERE ATTEMPTING. TO DEAL WITH. ORDINARY REAL LIFE. CHALLENGES AS I TELL RYAN THIS CALL THE DAHLE TEAM. MOST OF US ARE ONE OR TWO PAYCHECKS AWAY FROM CRISES AS A RESULT OF A HEALTH ISSUE WHEN THE CAR BREAKS DOWN OR WHEN THE ROOF LEAKS. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR CARS PAY REASONABLE CREDIT AND BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRULY IN AN HONEST SINCERE WAY BUILD CREDIT. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE YOUR THEIR FAMILIES AND SECURE THEIR FUTURES. LOTS OF EFFORT WENT INTO THIS BILL IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATIONS I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES IN THE FLOOR AND WE'RE ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE IN AB FIVE THREE NINE.

MADAM PROTIUM YOU'RE PREPARED FOR THAT ITEM MISTER CLARK PLEASE READ. A SOME OF THE ONE EIGHTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN AND ACT REALLY TO HAZARDOUS WASTE. MADAM PROTIUM. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS ARE RISE TO PRESENT AB ONE EIGHTY ONE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN. THIS BILL RECONCILES A CONFLICT BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE LAW BY CLARIFYING THAT MILITARY HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PAY ADVANCED FEES FOR PERMIT APPLICATIONS TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC. SUBSTANCES CONTROL TO BE CLEAR THE MILITARY WILL STILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY ALL OF THE REASONABLE SERVICE CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERMIT RENEWAL AND ALL OTHER CHARGES APPROVED BY SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION OR FEDERAL LAW. THE BILL IS NEEDED BECAUSE A NEW LEGAL CONFLICT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY A TWENTY SIXTEEN TRAILER BILL WHICH CREATED A NEW FEE FOR SERVICE PROGRAM REQUIRING 25% OF THE COST TO BE PAID UP FRONT. FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY PERMITS THE CONFLICT IS THAT FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS THE MILITARY FROM ENGAGING IN ADVANCE PAYMENTS. THE MILITARY OPERATES SEVEN HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE ON A TEN YEAR PERMIT TIMELINE IN SUPPORT OF THE MILITARY'S NATIONAL SECURITY MISSION AND TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SPECIFICALLY AFFECTS A NAVAL BASE IN MY COMMUNITY WHERE THE PERMIT IS CURRENTLY UP FOR RENEWAL. THE HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY ON NAVAL BASE CORONADO AND CITY COUNTY TREATS AND CONSOLIDATES A VARIETY OF HAZARDOUS WASTE STREAMS I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IBM.

AND ACTUALLY IN WATER. INTERACTIONS THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. ARE PURE WATER SAN DIEGO IS THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO'S GROUNDBREAKING WATER SUPPLY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO SUPPLY ONE THIRD OF THE CITY'S WATER SUPPLY. THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PROJECT HAS BEEN TIED UP AND WASTEFUL LITIGATION THAT THREATENS THE COMPLETION OF OUR PURE WATER. PROJECT AT A TIME WHEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND CYCLES OF DROUGHT IMPERIL OUR WATER SECURITY. SINCE JUNE THE PROJECT HAS BEEN STALLED DUE TO LITIGATION CLAIMING THE PROJECT VIOLATES PROPOSITION EIGHT WHICH IS A TWENTY TWELVE LOCAL BALLOT MEASURE. THAT PREVENTS THE CITY FROM MANDATING PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS ON CONSTRUCTION EXCEPT WHEN REQUIRED BY STATE OR FEDERAL LAW. AB TWELVE NINETY CLARIFIES THAT THE PROJECT IS ONE FOR WHICH STATE LAW REQUIRES PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND WITHOUT THIS CLARIFICATION THE COSTS ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE BY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR EACH MONTH OF DELAY. WITHOUT LEGAL CERTAINTY STATE FUNDS FOR THE PROJECT OF WELL OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ALREADY INVESTED WOULD BE IN PERIL. AB TWELVE NINETY IN THE PURE WATER PROJECT TO ENSURE OUR WATER RELIABILITY FOR THE SAN DIEGO REGION FOR DECADES TO COME. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER STONE GOOD MORNING MR PRESIDENT CONGRATULATIONS COLLEAGUES ON THE LAST DAY. THIRTEEN MORE HOURS OF SESSION I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB TWELVE NINETY SPONSORED BY THE UNION CAUCUS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE. THIS BILL WILL FORCE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO TO JOIN A UNION PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE STATE FUNDING FOR THEIR PEER WATER PROJECT WATER WOULD BE AN ADVANCE TREATMENT FACILITY THAT CAN PRODUCE THIRTY MILLION GALLONS OF PURIFIED WATER EVERY DAY. FIGHTING FOR A THIRD OF SAN DIEGO'S DRINKING WATER. WHICH I THINK IS VERY INNOVATIVE. WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CLEAN WATER ON THE FLOOR THIS YEAR SO I'M CURIOUS WHY ARE NOW TALKING ABOUT STOPPING CLEAN WATER FROM BEING DELIVERED TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR STATE SECOND LARGEST CITY. BUT LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THIS BILL. THE PEOPLE SPOKE BUT PROPOSITION EIGHT PASSED BY 58% IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE NONE OF THE CITY'S PROJECT OPPOSED APPEAL A REQUIREMENT BUT I GUESS THE BIG LEAD LABOR UNION BOSSES DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THE PEOPLE DECIDE AGAIN THE PEOPLE AREN'T BEING LISTENED TO AND SAY TO CALIFORNIA AND FRANKLY I THINK HER GET A LITTLE BIT UPSET. SO IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IN THE BIG LABOR UNION BOSSES PASSED AN ORDINANCE THAT KEPT. NON UNION APPRENTICESHIPS. AND APPRENTICES FROM WORKING ON THREE OF THE PURE WATER PROJECTS. IF BIG LABOR BOSSES COULDN'T CONVINCE THE VOTERS. I GUESS THEY FIGURE THEY CAN INTIMIDATE THE ELECTED OFFICIALS TO GIVE THEM THEIR NGUYEN. BUT ABOUT A YEAR LATER A LAWSUIT WAS FILED AGAINST THE BIG LABOR UNION BOSSES. THE COURT RULED THE CITY WAS WRONG. AND THE FORCING ONLY UNION APPRENTICES TO BE USED VIOLATED THE PEOPLE'S INTENT OF PROPOSITION A- AFTER THAT RULING LEGAL KNOWS OF NEGOTIATIONS BEGAN. AND THEY'RE STILL GOING ON WHICH BRINGS ME HERE TODAY. AB TWELVE MIND USE GOAL IS TO RESOLVE A CITY LEGAL DISPUTE OVER. AS THEY CONTROL THIS LEGISLATURE THIS MEASURES INTENT IS TO VIOLATE LOCAL CONTROL AND THE WILL OF THE VOTERS IN THE NAME OF BIG LABOR UNION BOSSES. HOW MANY BILLS ARE WE GOING TO SEE THIS YEAR WHERE THE UNION CAUCUS. IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THE VOTING MEMBERS OF THIS BODY THAN THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AB TOLD MINE IS NOTHING MORE THAN ANOTHER AGENDA ITEM FOR THIS LEGISLATURE'S FAMED UNIT CAUCUS. BIG LABOR'S Là BIG LABOR LOSS IN SAN DIEGO WHEN THEY LOST PROPOSITION EIGHT. THIS BILL IS NOTHING MORE THAN A WAY FOR BIG LABOR BOSSES TO GO. TO THEIR FRIENDS ON THE LEGISLATURE TO CHANGE THE RULES AFTER THE FACT TO SUPPORT. THE WILL. OF THE VOTERS IN SAN DIEGO MY FRIEND YOU CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THIS IS THE WILL OF THE VOTE VOTERS. AND IN SOME CASES ON ISSUES YOU'RE AGREE WITH THEM. AND SOME YOU JUST EGGS NOR THERE WILL. IN ANOTHER ISSUES YOU JUST DISAGREE WITH THEM ON THOSE ISSUES THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS JUST THAT YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH ISSUES YOU THINK THE PEOPLE GOT RIGHT AND WHICH ONES YOU THINK THEY GOT WRONG. IF YOU'RE REALLY A BELIEVER IN LOCAL CONTROL. IF YOU'RE REALLY A BELIEVER THAT THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE REALLY CONTROL THIS STATE YOU SHOULD VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. IF IT PASSES IT SHOWS THAT THIS BODY CARES MORE ABOUT TAKING CARE OF THE UNIONS AND THEIR BOSSES THAN LISTENING TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. IN HONOR OF THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT-DEPEND ON US TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS FOR THEM. AND NOT FOR THE UNIONS I URGE A NO VOTE IN AB TWELVE NINETY. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT TIE RISE IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. TWELVE NINETY. COLLEAGUES PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS DO NOT HAVE A SUCCESSFUL TRACK RECORD I WILL SPARE YOU THE DETAILS BUT I CAN GIVE YOU PLENTY. FROM THE CITY. AND COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. ARE CURRENTLY.

ESPECIALLY AS THE GOOD SENATOR FROM TEMECULA POINTED OUT WHEN SAN DIEGO VOTERS RECENTLY VOTED AGAINST REQUIRING PLA'S UNLESS FORCED TO. THE COURT UPHELD THIS BALLOT MEASURE JUST LAST MONTH. SO IF YOU FAIL AT THE BALLOT. AND IF YOU FAIL AT THE BENCH. YOU COME TO THE BANKS OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. AND ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO DO AN END RUN. THAT MY COLLEAGUES IS CLASSIC SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS BODY TO DO AN END RUN WE SHOULD BE POOR. AND WE SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE ON A. B. TWELVE NINETY THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO TWELVE NINETY.

TODAY I SIMPLY STAND HERE TO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE A PROJECT THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR COUNTY AND THEIR CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE SOME DISCUSSION OVER THE LANGUAGE IN OUR LOCAL PROPOSITION. PROPOSITION A FROM TWENTY TWELVE IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS IT SAYS THERE IS NOTHING IN MEASURE A TO IMPEDE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WE ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO GET OUR PROJECT DONE. SO FOR MY COLLEAGUES WHO WANT TO LOOK AT IT MULTIPLE WAYS YOU WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT PHILOSOPHICALLY WHAT DO SUPPORT PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS OR NOT. I WOULD ALSO SAY I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THERE'RE ARE PROJECTS THAT HAVE GONE WELL AND NOT WELL BUT- YOU KNOW EXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL PLA'S INCLUDE THE HOOVER DAM DISNEY WORLD. OUR NEW STATE BUILDINGS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT TWELFTH AND NEW COURTHOUSE CONSTRUCTION THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN ONE OF OUR MAJOR PROJECTS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WAS UNDER AND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM THE SOUTH BAY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. REMEMBER AS WELL THAT WE DID A VERY SUCCESSFUL FIRST TIME EVER PL A PROJECT THROUGH THE WATER AUTHORITY AND WE SAVED MONEY AND THE PROJECT WAS DONE. BY EARLY NOT ON TIME BUT EARLY SO WE CAN DEBATE THOSE THINGS WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF GOOD PROJECTS. THAT HAVE GOTTEN DONE BUT TODAY WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THAT YOU SUPPORT MY LOCAL COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO GET ARE PURE WATER PROJECT DONE WHICH IS GOING TO HELP OUR COUNTY BE MORE. WATER SUSTAINABLE SELF SUSTAINABLE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MEASURES ABOUT TODAY SO TO GIVE THE CLARITY SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THE RESOURCES AND NOT INCREASE THE COST OF THIS PROJECT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN SUPPORT. OF MY LOCAL. COMMUNITY IN SAN DIEGO TO GET THIS PROJECT DONE. THANK YOU ALL DEBATE AND DISCUSSION HAVEN'T SEES TO MISTER SECTOR ISLAND MR TO CENTER JONES. SORRY MR PRESIDENT HAS A BIT LATE GETTING MY MICROPHONE UP I DO WANT TO RISE IN. OPPOSITION TO AB TWELVE NINETY AS I'VE SHARED ON THIS FOR MANY TIMES. YOU KNOW I COME FROM A UNION FAMILY AND I TRY TO SUPPORT LOCAL UNION PRODUCTS IN EFFORTS WHEN I CAN. AND WHEN THE PRICE IN THE QUALITY IS COMPETITIVE. THE PROBLEM WITH AB TWELVE NINETY IS THAT IT SEEKS TO FORCE THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT WHERE ONE IS NOT NEEDED OR APPROPRIATE. VOTERS IN SAN DIEGO HAVE ALREADY MADE THE DECISION THAT P. L. A.'S. SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED IMPROPER ON PUBLIC PROJECTS OKAY UNIONS SHALL NOT BE SENATE DISTRICT. UNIONS SHALL NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. NOR SHALL THEY BE GRANTED FAVORITISM. I CAN LIVE WITH THAT DECISION BY THE VOTERS AND I'M MYSTIFIED WHY THIS KEEPS COMING UP AND THE MAJOR IS SO AGAINST FOLLOWING THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. THE PURE. INCREASES WATER RELIABILITY AND SECURITY FOR YEARS TO COME. FRIVOLOUS LEGISLATION SUCH AS AB TWELVE NINETY WILL ONLY INCREASE LITIGATION WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO DELAY THE WATER THE PURE WATER PROJECT I SINCERELY URGING NO VOTE ON A. B. TWELVE NINETY THANK YOU. NOW THIS IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. IF NOT MADAM PROTIUM YOU CAN CLOSE ONCE AGAIN I WILL CLOSE ONE MORE TIME BY SAYING. THE RESOURCES IN THE ADDITIONAL FOUR MILLION ON A MONTHLY BASIS IN THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY HAS GOTTEN. IF WE DON'T SUCCESSFULLY DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE THIS COSTS WILL BE PASSED ON TO OUR RATE PAYERS. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IN MY COUNTY WERE WERE COST WE ALREADY ARE PAYING COSTS TO SUPPORT. THE SELF STORAGE CONSERVATION PROGRAMS THIS PURE WATER PROGRAM THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON THIS AND I WOULD JUSTSAY. I REALLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON SOMETHING AND THAT WILL SAVE TAXPAYERS DOLLARS AND AT THE SAME TIME HONOR OUR COMMITMENT. TO PROVIDE RELIABLE WATER IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE THOSE.

OURS TWENTY EIGHT KNOWS NINE THEN THE MEASURE PASSES NOW MEMBERS WERE MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM TWENTY SENATOR WALKER YOU PREPARE TO TAKE UP THAT ITEM. YES MR SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOURTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ AN ACT RELATING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SENATOR WORK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN LIBERATED GONZALEZ FLETCHER I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE A CA FOURTEEN AS A RESOLUTION TO PLACE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY STANDARDS ON THE BALLOT. EACH OF YOU WILL BE SURE VOTE ON YOUR OWN CRITERIA. FOR SOME OF YOU THE ISSUE IS EQUITY. THE STATE AUDITOR REPORTED TO US IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THAT OUTSOURCED SERVICE WORKERS WOMEN AND MEN WHO CLEAN THE TOILETS CUT THE GRASS. COOK THE FOOD AN EMPTY THE BED PANS EARN ON AVERAGE THREE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SIX CENTS LESS PER HOUR THEN YOU SEE EMPLOYEES WHO DO THE EXACT SAME WORK. THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT MOST OF THE SEVEN THOUSAND TO NINE THOUSAND OUT SOURCE SERVICE WORKERS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE. AND HE'S CALIFORNIANS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY IN THE GRANTS IN AFRICAN AMERICANS. OTHERS IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WORTHY OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. I WILL REMIND YOU THAT THE LAST CONSTITUTIONAL MINUTE WE PUT ON THE BALLOT. WAS SCA NINE HE WENT TO THE BALLOT WITH UNANIMOUS VOTE. OF THIS AND PREP PRACTICALLY EVERY EVERY SENATOR ON THIS FLOOR. PAST SAID IT WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS THAT AMENDED ALLOWED HOMEOWNERS TO INSTALL RAIN WATER CAPTURE SYSTEMS IN THEIR HOMES WITHOUT HAVING THOSE SYSTEMS ADD O INCREASE PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT. VALUATIONS WELL THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE HOME THERE HAS BEEN MANY HOMEOWNERS WHO'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE THIS PROPERTY DID TAX BREAK TODAY WE HOPE THERE WILL BE. OTHERS OF YOU MIGHT BE CONCERNED ABOUT HAM STRINGING YOU SEE MEDICAL CENTERS AND DENYING THEM NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY TO MEET FLUCTUATIONS IN PATIENT COUNTS OTHER TEMPORARY STAFFING NEEDS. I WANT TO DIRECT YOU TO YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE FIVE OF THE ACA WE ACTUALLY AMENDED INTO THE MEASURE UC'S OWN PER DIEM EMPLOYEE POLICY TO ALLOW THAT FLEXIBILITY. AND THE SENATOR FROM SANTA ANA ADDED AN AMENDMENT TO FURTHER GUARANTEE FLEXIBILITY FOR YOU SEE MEDICAL CENTERS. IN ADDITION TO EQUITY ANOTHER CONCERN THAT I PERSONALLY HAD WAS COST. AN ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED BY MIKE GYMNAST WHO MANY YOU KNOW WAS THAT THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE FOR OUR LAST REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. IN HIS ANALYSIS WAS CLEAR THAT HE CA FOURTEEN MEETS THE STANDARDS OF REPUBLICAN FISCAL PRUDENCE. THE INCREASED COST OF WISHING BENEFIT PARITY FOR THE SERVICE WORKERS IS COMPLETELY OFFSET BY THE SAVINGS IN OVERHEAD AND STILL LEAVES ACCORDING TO MY CHEN S. THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR ANY OVERHEAD OR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS YOU SEE MIGHT INCUR. ALLOW ME TO READ THE LAST SENTENCE OF HIS ANALYSIS QUOTE WE CONCLUDE THAT YOU SEE CAN ABSORB THE COST TO BE CA FOURTEEN WITHIN THE AMOUNTS CURRENTLY BUDGETED FOR THE EXISTING CONTRACTS IN QUOTE. SENATORS THE WORK HAS BEEN DONE THIS CASE IS CLEAR AND CLEAN AND IF WE HAVE THE POWERS OF BODY TO ADOPT A CA FOURTEEN. I AM CONFIDENT WE WOULD. BUT THAT POWER IS RESERVED TO THE VOTERS SO LET'S GIVE THE PEOPLE WHO ELECT US THE CHANCE TO ADOPT THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY STANDARD ACT. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MADAM PROJECT. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A CA FOURTEEN. SOME MAY WONDER WHY THE LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN UP THE ISSUE AND I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS SIMPLE WE MUST. WE MUST BECAUSE THE STATE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE UC REGENTS POWER OVER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE PLAGUING THE SYSTEM. I AND THAT IS THROUGH A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. WE MUST BECAUSE WORKING PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN OUR RENOWNED UNIVERSITY SYSTEM ARE GETTING CUT OUT OF JOBS. THEY'RE GETTING CUT OUT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. HIGHER EDUCATION IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR MIDDLE CLASS AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS THE CROWN JEWEL OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. BUT THE UC UNDERMINES ITS BENEFITS TO THE MIDDLE CLASS BY FAILING TO PROVIDE STABLE A STABLE LIFESTYLE FOR THE WORKERS THAT THE UC DEPENDS ON. OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE UC HAS CONTRACTED OUT THOUSANDS OF SUPPORT SERVICES JOBS FOR THE UNIVERSITY IT'S AN ECONOMIC DECISION SEEMINGLY MADE WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF HOW THESE CHOICES MADE BY THE UC AFFECT THE LIVES OF THEIR WORKERS. EACH TIME THE UC MAKES THIS CHOICE ELIMINATES THE STABILITY OF A JOB THAT HAS HEALTH BENEFITS AND A SECURE RETIREMENT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN RECENT YEARS WITH MULTIPLE BILLS AN AUDIENCE UNFORTUNATELY NONE OF THIS HAS LED TO THE UNIVERSITY CHANGE LET THE UNIVERSITY TO CHANGE ITS BEHAVIOR DESPITE THE CLEAR INTENT. AND MESSAGE SENT BY THE LEGISLATURE. THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR DECADES. THE UC HAS BEEN CONTRACTING OUT AND ATTEMPTING TO CIRCUMVENT ITS OWN WORKERS FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS. BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE UCLA HARDEN OUTSIDE CUSTODIAL FORM TO SERVICE A GYMNASTICS CHAMPIONSHIP. AND THREATEN TO USE CONTRACT ESTONIANS FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR OLYMPICS. THE HIRING CHOICES MADE IN THE EIGHTIES WERE A SHORT SIGHTED THEN AS THEY ARE TODAY. FARMING OUT LOW WAGE JOBS RESULTED WORKERS BEING FORCED TO LIVE ON THE FRIENDS AND HAVING TO RELY ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES AND HEALTH CARE. CHOOSING TO PROVIDE STABLE JOBS ON THE FRONT IN INSURES THAT PEOPLE CAN PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH BENEFITS RETIREMENT EVERY UC EMPLOYEES SHOULD HAVE THAT STABILITY. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN TO FLOURISH AND HOPEFULLY ONE DAY IN ROLE AT ONE OF OUR GREAT UNIVERSITIES THAT IS THE CALIFORNIA DREAM THAT BUILDS A STRONGER MIDDLE CLASS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NURSING ASSISTANTS COOKS CUSTODIAN STERILE PROCESSING TECHNICIANS GROUNDS KEEPERS. THESE ARE THE WORKERS DOING THE DIRTY TOUGH JOBS THE WORKERS WHOSE EFFORTS MIGHT NOT BE TOP OF THE MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF YOU SEE ARTS MEDICAL CENTERS. BUT THEIR INTERNAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THE AVERAGE SUPPORT SERVICE WORKER YOU SEE IS PAID ON AVERAGE AS I SAID THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. WHICH IS IRONICALLY THE AVERAGE TAKE HOME PAY. FOR THE UC SENIOR EXECUTIVES PER MONTH. WILL A CA HINDER THE UC'S ABILITY TO RUN THEIR MEDICAL CENTERS I THINK THE MANAGER OF THE BILL RESPONDED TO THAT ISSUE SO I DON'T NEED TO GO FURTHER INTO THAT. THE ACA FOURTEEN MAKES PROVISIONS FOR THOSE SITUATIONS. CONTRACTING OUT HAS ITS PLACE. AND THIS MEASURE CONTINUES TO ALLOW FOR PER DIEM EMPLOYEES AS ALSO WAS MENTIONED SO I THINK THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SHOULD SEE WHAT CHANGE NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW. IT IS A PHENOMENAL INSTITUTION THAT WE'RE ALL PROUD TO CHAMPION ACA FOURTEEN INTERESTS THAT ARE PRIVATE ALSO CAN EXTEND TO THE UC'S PRACTICES AS AN EMPLOYER. COLLEAGUES WE PASSED A LAW THIS WEEK THAT HOLDS CORPORATIONS TO A HIGHER STANDARD AND DISALLOWS CLASSIFYING EMPLOYEES AS CONTRACTORS IN ORDER TO SKIRT FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS. WE SHOULD HOLD THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO THE SIMILAR HIGH STANDARDS. IN THE END A CA FOURTEEN SIMPLY ALLOWS FOR THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA TO DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR THE UC AND ITS WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. ON A MORE PERSONAL NOTE YOU KNOW I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE I'VE ALREADY TALKED A LOT THIS MORNING. BUT IN FACT I'VE MANAGED ONLY THREE BILLS ALL DISTRICT RELATED BILLS ONLY THREE. AND ONE MAJOR BILL THE TENET PROTECTIONS BILL I AM SPEAKING ON THIS ONE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE HERE TO SUPPORT WORKERS I DON'T SEE HOW WE CANNOT TAKE THIS ACTION TODAY AND AT LEAST. GIVE THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS ISSUE THEY HAVE THAT RIGHT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A CA FOURTEEN. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MEASURE. YOU CENTER OUR GELATO. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I RISE TODAY IS PROUD CO AUTHOR. AC A FOURTEEN GREAT LEADERS IN OUR NATION ARE FOR SERVICES HAVE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT OUR SOLDIERS HOLDING THE LOWEST RANKS ARE BEING TAKEN OF TAKING CARE OF EACH AND EVERY DAY WE SAY THAT AGAIN GREAT LEADERS IN OUR NATION'S ARMED SERVICES HAVE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT OUR SOLDIERS HOLDING THE LOWEST RANKS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF FIRST. LEADERSHIP THAT IS BEING TAUGHT IN OUR MILITARY INSTITUTIONS EMPHASIZED THAT AN OFFICER SOMEONE AND LEADERSHIP POSITION MUST ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF HIS SUBORDINATES FIRST AND FOREMOST THE GOVERNMENT WE LEAD IT SHOULD DO THE SAME SADLY OUR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DEVIATED FROM THESE CORE VALUES. EVEN IF YOU'RE COOKING CLEANING CUTTING THE GRASS YOU'RE WORKING FOR THE UC SYSTEM YOU SHOULD BE PAID AS A UC EMPLOYEE. TERRY RUNS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY AND MERIT AND SO SHOULD OUR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM THIS IS WHY I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT YOU SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO A CA FOURTEEN. IT'S SORT OF COMES INTO THAT WHO'S YOUR DADDY. CATEGORY IS IT GONNA BE MANAGEMENT OR IS IT GOING TO BE LABOR. COLLEAGUES THE UC SYSTEM HAD AN UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT THE LAST TWO YEARS OF NINETEEN BILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS DUE TO GRANTING GREAT BENEFITS TO ITS WORKFORCE. MAINLY THE AN. PAID RETIREE MEDICAL LIABILITIES. SO THE UC SYSTEM IS FACING FISCAL STRESS. TAKING COST SAVING OUTSOURCING OFF THE TABLE. WILL. AT THE END RESULT IN INCREASED TUITION. THE MONEYHAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE. NO WONDER THE UC SYSTEM ITSELF OPPOSES AC EIGHT FOURTEEN. THE BORDER REGIONS WILL POINT TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE VOTERS SHOULD THE PROPOSITION SUCCEED WHEN IT ANNOUNCES ITS NEXT TUITION INCREASE. AND THEY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO. CONSEQUENTLY. I BELIEVE THE VOTERS WILL OPPOSE THE BALLOT MEASURE. BUT WE SHOULD SAVE THEM THE FRUSTRATION OF TELLING SACRAMENTO TO LET MANAGERS MANAGE. I RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON A CA FOURTEEN THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU CENTER WHITE HOUSE. MISTER PRESIDENT YESTERDAY DURING THE PRAYER OUR OWN SYSTEM MICHELLE GORMAN QUOTED FROM ALICE WALKER IN YOU MAY RECALL IT WAS WAKE UP THE WORLD HAS CHANGED. YOU KNOW WE CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE TELL PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO TREAT THEIR EMPLOYERS THEIR EMPLOYEES AS EMPLOYEES AND NOT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHILE TOLERATING THE SAME BEHAVIOR WITHIN OUR OWN UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. THE FACT THAT YOU SEE ITSELF ESTIMATES THAT THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WOULD FORCE THEM TO INCREASE WAGES AND BENEFIT LEVELS BY AT LEAST UNDER COMPENSATING HUNDREDS OF CONTRACT WORKERS FOR TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. WE NEED TO COMBAT COMBAT THIS DOWN RULES PRESSURE ON WAGES IN OUR OWN HOUSE I'M ALSO CO AUTHOR ENERGY NAY VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU A MISTER PRESIDENT TO AND MEMBERS I KNOW THAT THE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE IN THE SUPPORTERS COME AT THIS ISSUE WITH IT WITH A GOOD HEART THEY CARE ABOUT ARE WORKING PEOPLE AT THE UNIVERSITY AND ELSEWHERE THEY WANT THEM TO HAVE A DECENT LEVEL OF PAY AND BENEFITS AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I CERTAINLY SHARE ON I BELIEVE EVERYBODY ON THE FLOOR SHARES. BUT THIS MEASURE IS A IS A DRASTIC ONE. AND IF I COULD I'M GONNA REFERENCE THE ANALYSIS THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED EACH MEMBER. ON THIS. IT'S A THIS ONE SECOND. IT SAYS THIS THAT IT PROVIDES THE REGION'S FOR THE CAMPUS. MAY CONTRACT FOR LABOR TO PERFORM SUPPORT SERVICES ONLY IF AUTHORIZED TO DO SO BY STATUTE AND ONLY FOR LIMITED EXCEPTIONS INCLUDE AMONG OTHER THINGS A BONAFIDE EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCE. SO TO CHANGE FROM OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS MEASURE REQUIRES THAT THEY HAVE LIMITED EXCEPTIONS AND THEY HAVE TO DO SO BY STATUTE AND DO SO BY STATUTE MEANS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO PASS A LAW TO ALLOW. THAT CONTRACTING OUT PROVISIONS. SO FROM MY POINT OF VIEW. THE MEASURE BEFORE US IS A COMPLETE BAN ON CONTRACTING OUT FOR A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES. AND THEIR HOSPITALS NO MATTER HOW SHORT TERM. AN EXPECTED OR NECESSARY THEY MAY BE. AND AS I SAID THE ONLY. SIGNIFICANT SECTION TO THAT IS IF THEY GOT STATUTORY APPROVAL THAT MEANS THEY WOULD BE LEGISLATION FIRST TO ALLOW AT THE HIRING OF SHORT TERM EMERGENCY HOSPITAL WORKERS. LIKE STAFFING UP TO RESPOND TO A NATURAL DISASTER CAN YOU IMAGINE THEM COMING IN ASKING FOR A LAW. DO WITH THAT. IT REQUIRES THE LEGISLATION TO TRAIN YOU SEE EMPLOYEES. ON SAFETY IMPROPERLY USE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT. IT WOULD REQUIRE LAW. FOR AND TO ANTICIPATED SPECIAL EVENTS I EVEN WHEN THE UNIVERSITY HAS LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS TO PLAN FOR IT SUCH AS SPEAKERS I CAMPUS REQUIRE AN EXTRA SECURITY AND CLEAN UP. AND EVEN REQUIRES LEGISLATION FOR STAFF FOR SOME STUDENT HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. THE TAKEN AWAY THAT FLEXIBILITY ON CLINICAL CARE STAFFING DECISIONS. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IS GOING TO CREATE IMPACT ON VULNERABLE PATIENTS AND BY THE WAY 60% OF. YOU SEE PATIENTS ARE MEDI CAL FOR MEDICARE. SUPPORTED NOW THIS WOULD ONLY APPLY TO UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA NOT TO ANY OTHER HOSPITAL OR INSTITUTION IN CALIFORNIA. YOU SEE WOULD HAVE TO HIRE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES FOR WORK HE NEEDS DONE ONLY OCCASIONALLY. TURN OF LATE YOU SEE WOULD HAVE TO DECREASE THE SERVICES IT PROVIDES THE STUDENTS. PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC. AND THINK ABOUT THIS YOU SEE WITH A WITH A SHOULD I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE FORCED. THE HIRE WORKERS FOR THINGS THAT THEY NEED DONE A FEW TIMES A YEAR CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOUR HOUSE YOU EDIT CUT A TREE DOWN. DO YOU HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO DO THAT NO YOU HAVE TO HIRE SOMEBODY IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS AND IN YOU'RE NOT IN THE AIR CONDITIONING BUSINESS BUT YEAR CONDITIONS GOES GOES DOWN. IMAGINE HAVING AIR CONDITIONING REPAIR PEOPLE ON ON YOUR STAFF ALL THE TIME FOR THINGS THAT AREN'T EVEN THAT CENTRAL CORE OF YOUR BUSINESS. SO THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS IN HERE THAT. REALLY AREN'T A FISSION AND READ SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE COSTS. THANK YOU SEE AND ITS WORKERS CAN BARGAIN AND THEY DO WE THEY HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND THEY AND THEY HAVE SHOWN THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CLOSE CONTRACTS YOU SEE IN ITS UNIONS OF SUCCESSFULLY CLOSE CONTRACTS. WITH ALL THE OTHER UNIONS. AND KEEP IN MIND. IF THE CRITICISM IS SOMEHOW THIS CONTRACTING OUT HAS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN YOU SEE EMPLOYMENT IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE THAT WE SEE. UNION EMPLOYMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S BEEN GOING UP FOR MANY MANY YEARS NOT THE OPPOSITE. MEMBERS WE HAVE NEW MEMBERS IN LEADERSHIP AT THE BOARD OF REGENTS I KNOW YOU KNOW MANY OF THEM. AND THEY HAVE INDICATED TO ME THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED. TO CREATING A FAIR CONTRACTING PRACTICE. AND I TRUSTED THAT LEADERSHIP THAT THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS IS JOHN FOR AS A FORMER UNION LEADER AND HE HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE WANTS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THE BEST CONTRACTING OUT PROVISIONS STANDARDS OF ANY PUBLIC INSTITUTION IN THE COUNTRY AND I THINK HE SHOULD BE GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY TO TRY. BUT A CONSTITUTIONAL MEN NOW. COULD PASS AND IT WOULD BE PERMANENT. HI DOES SET A PRECEDENT. AND IT DOES CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MANY OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE OCCASIONALLY. WITH THAT INSTITUTION THAT SOMEHOW BE NOW SUBJECT TO. ANOTHER CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE COULD HAPPEN EVERY YEAR COULD HAPPEN EVERY SESSION. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD GIVE THE UNIVERSITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO WORK THESE ISSUES OUT THIS THIS. THIS CONSTITUTIONAL MA'AM IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PASSED TODAY WE COULD TAKE THIS MATTER UP IN JANUARY AND HAVE THE SAME RESULT TO THE BENEFIT THAT THEY DESIRE PUTTING THIS MEASURE ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. SO IN SUMMARY. WE HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HARD FOUGHT. WE SHOULD ALLOW THAT. PROCESS TO. RESOLVE A LOT OF THESE ISSUES INCLUDING THIS ONE. NUMBER TWO YOU SEE DOES HAVE A DEGREE OF IT AYE TANAMI. BUT THE BOARD CHAIR IS MADE AS KIM IS A CLEAR HIS COMMITMENT TO HAVE HIGH STANDARDS FOR CONTRACTING OUT HE SHOULD BE GIVEN THAT CHANCE. AND NOT ADDRESSING THIS BILL TODAY DOESN'T. STOP THE CONVERSATION DOESN'T PREVENT THE RESULTS THAT THIS MEASURE DESIRES WHICH IS A BALLOT MEASURE NEXT OF AMBER. AND BECAUSE OF THOSE REASONS I THINK WE SHOULD VOTE NO ON THIS MEASURE TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR GALGIANI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WAS AROUND IN THE ASSEMBLY WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE BUDGET CRISIS IN THE UC SYSTEM PUT EMPLOYEES ON FURLOUGH THEY INCREASE CONTRACTING OUT AND THEY REDUCED PAY AND THEY RAISED TUITION FOR STUDENTS AND WITHIN A YEAR. IT WAS LEARNED THAT SECRETLY THEY HAD GIVEN BONUSES TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT THREE POINT ONE MILLION OR THEY WERE PLANNING TO FOUR THIRTY EIGHT POP EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES AND THEY WERE DOING THAT AFTER HAVING MADE RAISES TO TUITION AND FOR LOW'S TO EMPLOYEES THAT WAS A BLATANT DISREGARD AND DISRESPECT FOR THE EMPLOYEES AND IN MY VIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL BECAUSE WE AGREED TO THE TERMS AT THAT TIME. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE WE WERE IN OUR WHERE WE WERE WITH THE ECONOMY I THINK THIS BILL IS NECESSARY I TRUST ARE FORMER SPEAKER WHO IS NOW ON THE BOARD OF REGENTS TO DO A GREAT JOB AND TO DO ALL THAT HE CAN WHILE HE IS ON THE BOARD BUT JUST LIKE THIS LEGISLATURE PASSES BILLS BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE HAVE A GOVERNOR THAT WE FEEL WE CAN WORK WITH AND TRUST AND OTHER TIMES WE MAY NOT IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE NEED TO LOOK BEYOND JUST WAS ON THE BOARD AT THIS POINT IN TIME BUT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HAVING A STRUCTURE THERE SO THAT WE DON'T SEE THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN AND WE DON'T SEE. THINGS HAPPEN ON THE BACKS OF EMPLOYEES WHO QUITE FRANKLY ARE BARELY GETTING BY AND JUST JUST MAKING ENOUGH ONLY. TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT HI TO RELUCTANTLY RISE IN OPPOSITION TO ACA FOURTEEN THE CONTRACTING PROHIBITIONS CONTAINED IN THE MEASURE WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT AND DISASTROUS FISCAL IMPACTS ON THE UNIVERSITY IN SPECIFICALLY OF THE UC SYSTEM CALCULATES THE INCREASED OPERATING COSTS ALMOST A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR BASED ON THE ADDITIONAL WAGE AND BENEFIT PREMIUMS ASSOCIATED WITH BRINGING CARL THIS CONTRACTED WORK IN HOUSE. FOR UC SAN DIEGO WHICH IS NOT DIRECTLY IN MY DISTRICT BUT CERTAINLY IN MY EGION THEY ESTIMATE THAT THIS WILL INCREASE FACILITIES MAINTENANCE COSTS BY TWENTY ONE POINT EIGHT ALMOST TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION IN BY SIX AND A HALF MILLION FOR THE FOLLOWING YEARS SINCE UC SAN DIEGO MUST ENSURE FUNDING FOR OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY STUDENTS THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS WILL DEAL A HEAVY FINANCIAL BLOW TO THE CAMPUS AS A WHOLE. AND IT'S MEDICAL ENTERPRISE AND THE COST OF TUITION YOU SEE MEDICAL CENTERS ON THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ARE STILL IN OPPOSITION TO A CA FOURTEEN STATING IT ALSO THREATENS UC'S MEDICAL CENTERS ABOUT JEOPARDIZING PATIENT SAFETY IN INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS THE UC HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HAS A SPECIAL PLACE IN CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE PLANS GATE ADMISSION FOCUSED NOT ONLY ON CLINICAL CARE BUT ALSO RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. DELIVERING FOR PATIENTS AND COMMUNITIES IN EACH OF THESE AREAS RELIES UPON A ROBUST STAFFING FRAMEWORK THAT INCLUDES BOTH DIRECT EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACT STAFFING THE MEDICAL CENTERS ARE OFTEN THE ONLY LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTERS IN THE REGION PROVIDING THE MAJORITY OF HIGHLY SPECIALIZED SERVICES. HALF OF ALL THE TRANSPLANT PROCEDURES STATEWIDE IN A QUARTER OF THE SEVERE BURN CARE DELIVERY. TO CALIFORNIANS PROVIDING THIS HIGH LEVEL OF. SHOULD CARE DEMANDS THE DELICATE BALANCE OF STAFFING RESOURCES WITHOUT HAVING TO COME TO THIS JUST LATER WITH EVERY SPECIAL NEED THEY MIGHT HAVE. WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO SUPPLEMENT STAFFING WITHOUT COMING BACK HERE WITH CONTRACT LABOR THESE CRITICAL SERVICES WILL BE LAID CAN AFFECT OUR ACCESS TO CARE SO ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S TREASURED UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. I URGE MY SENATE COLLEAGUES TO OPPOSE ACA FOURTEEN. THANK YOU SENATOR BILL. MEMBERS SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF A CA FOURTEEN. MEMBERS LONG AGO WELL AS A STUDENTS OUT OF THE STATE. STUDENTS AT THE UC BERKELEY ASKED US TO ATTEND A RALLY. FOR THE MAINTENANCE WORKERS TO GET THE FAIR WAGES AT THE UNIVERSITY. I BRING THIS UP TO ILLUSTRATE HOW LONG THIS ISSUE HAS OF FAIR TREATMENT OF LOW PAID WORKERS AT THE UC SYSTEM HAS BEEN WITH US. TO HAVE THIS ON MATT SOCIAL SERVICES ISSUE HANG OVER THIS STATE. FOR SO LONG. IS APPALLING AND IT IS AN EMBARRASSMENT. THE COMMON EXCUSE IS TO YOU LET THE REGENTS HANDLE THAT HAS BEEN USED MANY FOR MANY YEARS. TO EXCLUDE THESE WORKERS FROM FAIR TREATMENT BY USING THE STATE CONSTITUTION AS AN EXCUSE ONE OTHERWISE THEY WOULD RECEIVE BETTER TREATMENT UNDER OUR LAWS IS DISCRIMINATORY. I BELIEVE THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO CORRECT THE UNFAIRNESS. BY SUPPORTING A CA FOURTEEN. AS THE STUDENTS STAFF TEACHERS VISITORS WALK THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL GARDENS AND BUILDINGS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT LESSONS ARE LEARNED BY PERPETUATING THIS UNFAIRNESS TO THE WORKERS WHO WORK HARD MAINTAINING OUR UNIVERSITY. MARTIN LUTHER KING. SAID BEFORE THE MARCH ON SELMA HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE. HE ANSWERED HOW LONG NOT LONG. NOW THAT SHOULD BE OUR ANSWER. LET US BEEN TOWARDS JUSTICE. LET THE VOTERS DECIDE. IT'S BEEN TOO LONG URGE SUPPORT FOR A CA FOURTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I THINK THERE ARE REALLY GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE I THINK SOME OF THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THE PROPONENTS OF AC FOURTEEN ARE LOOKING AFTER IN THEIR ESTIMATION THE BEST INTEREST OF WORKERS IN UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM. ON THE FLIP SIDE I THINK THERE ARE CERTAINLY COMPELLING ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY I EMPLOYEES SHOULD TO. OR UNIVERSITY SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN CONTRACT FOR SERVICES AS NEEDED BECAUSE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS EBB AND FLOW OF THE NEEDS CHANGE. ON DEPENDING ON THE ECONOMY WE CAN EXPECT THAT EVEN FURTHER SPECIALLY AS WERE EXPECTING OUR ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO SLOW DOWN AS CYCLES OR INEVITABLE. WHAT I'M HEARING THOUGH IT. FROM FOLKS WHO WERE SUPPORTING A CA FOURTEEN. ARE THAT. THE BARGAINING UNIT PROCESS HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. I WOULD THINK THAT YOU'VE ALREADY WON TODAY. HOWEVER THIS VOTE PLAYS OUT BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO THE FOREFRONT TO THE HEIGHT OF POLITICAL AWARENESS AND I WOULD THINK THAT THIS. JUST BY VIRTUE OF WHAT HAS OCCURRED TODAY. HE'S GOING TO COMPEL FOLKS WITHIN THE REGIONS WITHIN THE BARGAINING UNITS TO TRY TO REACH AN ACCOMMODATION. AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN OF THE OPINION THAT THAT WIN WIN COMMON SENSE AND URGENCY ARE PAIRED RESULTS OCCUR. AND I THINK THAT CAN OCCUR RIGHT NOW. MY COLLEAGUE. FROM DOWN SOUTH HAD MENTIONED EARLIER. THIS IS A BROAD SWORD BEING BROUGHT TO A FAIRLY LIMITED ISSUE. TO REQUIRE STATUTORY AUTHORITY. OR ANY CHANGES TO OCCUR IN STAFFING. IT JUST SEEMS TERRIBLY TERRIBLY CUMBERSOME AND FRANKLY IT'S A FAIT ACCOMPLI AT THAT POINT IT JUST WOULDN'T HAPPEN SO WE HAVE NEW LEADERSHIP AT UC WE'VE WE'VE GOTTEN RENEWED COMMITMENTS THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE IN EARNEST ANOTHER STAB AT ALL REACHING AN ACCOMMODATION TOWARD UNDERSTANDING OF FOR THE BARGAINING UNITS IN TERMS CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT. WHY WOULDN'T WE BRING THIS MATTER BACK. LET THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE TASKED WITH REACHING A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING DECISIONS GIVE THEM IN ANOTHER FEW MONTHS. WHAT IT HURT IF THIS ISSUE WERE BROUGHT BACK IN JANUARY AND I ASKED THAT TO THE MOVERS OF THIS LEGISLATION. WHAT WOULD BE THE DOWN FALL WE COULD TAKE THIS MATTER UP IN JANUARY ALL OTHER BE ENOUGH TIME I SUSPECT TO PUT IT ON ON THE BALLOT IF IT IT'S STILL PROVED SO I THINK THAT IS AN OPTION I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE OPINION THAT WHEN LEGISLATORS PANIC BAD POLICIES MADE. AND I THINK GRAY HERE WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE WERE PANICKING AND USING A BROAD SWORD ON A DISCREET AND LIMITED ISSUE THAT FRANKLY MAKES FOR BAD POLICY. SO I THINK WITH THAT. I WOULD. I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO BE RECOMMENDING EITHER A NO OR A NEUTRAL ON THIS TO MY COLLEAGUES. JUST BECAUSE I THINK THAT COOLER HEADS CAN PREVAIL NOW THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT. AND LET'S GIVE THE AND YOU SEE AN OPPORTUNITY. WITH THEIR NEW LEADERSHIP TO FIND THEIR ACCOMMODATIONS I KNOW THAT FOLKS HAVE SAID. ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED AND THEY'VE LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS. BUT I THINK WITH NEW LEADERSHIP. THERE IS RENEWED HOPE AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO OR NEUTRAL ANY CA FOURTEEN. THANK YOU SENATOR TANK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS HIGH RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACA FOURTEEN. THE UC SYSTEM HAS OVER SIX HUNDRED ADMINISTRATORS AND STAFF WITH REPORTERS SALARIES OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S MORE THAN TWICE WHAT THE GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA MAKES. TWENTY FISCAL YEARS TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESENCE AYE MINISTERS SPENDING INCREASED BY AND WE CAN MAKE SURE JANITORS ARE TREATED EQUALLY. THE UC SYSTEM IS PUBLICLY FUNDED WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE TREATED FAIRLY. I REMEMBER WE ARE MERELY VOTING TO PUT THIS ON THE BALLOT. FOR CALIFORNIANS TO DECIDE. SO WITH THAT I ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM DIAMOND BARS. ACTIVE AND I WANT TO BROADEN THE SOCIAL REFLECTION A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I AM VERY PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF A CA FOURTEEN AND- THE REASON THAT I MADE THE DECISION TO BECOME A CO AUTHOR WAS AFTER. HEARING AND READING ABOUT ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES. AT THE ACTIONS THAT THEY HAD TAKEN AGAINST THE WORK FORCE TO. BASICALLY LAY THEM OFF AND BRING IN CONTRACT WORKERS AND I WAS SO APPALLED BY THAT I JUST FELT COMPELLED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND HOW THIS GETS BACK TO WHAT WHAT WHAT I'VE WORKED ON AND HOW IT'S IMPORTANT ME IS THIS AND I HAD A I HAVE HAVE A BILL THAT THAT THAT WAS OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY GOT OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY. THAT WOULD HAVE SUS STARTED TO SET SOME TARGETS FOR CALIFORNIA TO REDUCE POVERTY IN OUR STATE AND DEPENDING ON WHICH REPORT YOU READ OUR POVERTY LEVEL HAS STAYED BETWEEN TWENTY AND 25% FOR THE PAST TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND IT'S GOTTEN THAT WAY ECAUSE EXACTLY BECAUSE OF WHAT. MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM DIAMOND BAR HAS TALKED ABOUT IT IS THE FACT THAT THE LOWER. AID WORKERS ARE ARE LAID OFF OR THE REPLACED BY CONTRACT WORKERS WHO COME IN AND GET NO BENEFITS THEY GET NO RETIREMENT THEY GET NO HEALTH INSURANCE. THEY GET NO VACATION AND SICK LEAVE PAY AND THEY'RE REQUIRED TO WORK TWO OR THREE JOBS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. AND AT THE TOP YOU SEE HUGE BONUSES GOING OUT YOU SEE CEO'S AND CFO'S BETTER EARNING IN THE MULTIPLE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND THIS IS AT THE SAME TIME THAT WORKERS ARE GETTING DISPLACED AND SO. WHAT ACA IS THE ACA IS ATTEMPTING TO DO IS TO STOP THAT PRACTICE TO SAY THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE NOW ARE THERE SOME THINGS IT. PROBABLY SHOULD BE FIXED ABSOLUTELY NO BILL IS EVER PERFECT BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN WHEN WE SAY WELL. YOU KNOW MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT TILL JANUARY AND I GET IT THAT PROBABLY MAKES SOME SENSE WE CAN ALSO. IMPLORE OUR NEWLY ELECTED LEADERSHIP. ON THE BOARD TO GET IT RIGHT SO THAT THIS A CA DOESN'T NEED TO END UP ON THE BALLOT. IN IN MARCH IN NOVEMBER AS WELL. I JUST YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND I THINK WE HAVE TO STAND UP AND SAY OUR LOWEST PAID WORKERS. DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY I'M AND I AND I GOT TO SAY YOU KNOW I'M FROM I'M FROM A COPPER MINING FAMILY. AND PART OF WHAT THEY ORGANIZED FOR AND THEY WERE ABLE TO WIN AFTER MANY MANY YEARS IS A PENSION. IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO EARN A LIVING WAGE THEY COULD BUY THEIR OWN HOMES. THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE HEALTH CARE AND SICK LEAVE AND VACATION LEAVE ALL OF THOSE. ARE THE BENEFITS THAT WE COME TO TAKE FOR GRANTED IN WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN THIS TEMPORARY. COUNTRY CONTRACTED KIND OF ENVIRONMENT YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE KINDS OF PROTECTIONS AND SO. I'M I'M VERY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO STAND. HAPPENED TO SAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY BY THE WAY MY BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY WAS HELD AND IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE AND- AND I'M I'M IN A CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE AND FIGHT FOR IT BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU DON'T. SET GOALS YOU NEVER GET THERE AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE WE GOT TO GET THERE WE GOT TO DO THIS RIGHT. IT'S SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR DORADO. COLLEAGUES WE ARE SO PROUD. THAT WE DELIVER A FIRST CLASS EDUCATION FOR EVERYONE WHO GOES THROUGH THE UC SYSTEM AND I BEFORE I GO ON I WON IT KNOWLEDGE ALL MY SISTERS AND BROTHERS WHO ARE HERE WHO WORK FOR US. ON THOSE UC CAMPUSES. BECAUSE WE DELIVER FIRST CLASS EDUCATION WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FIRST CLASS WORK THAT IS DONE AND THEREFORE FIRST CLASS TREATMENT. THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK SO HARD TO HELP OUR STUDENTS SUCCEED. CHEAP LABOR ON OUR OWN STATE RUN UC CAMPUSES SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE. AND SISTERS A LEAGUES. TAXPAYERS PAY WE PAY FOR IT. EVERYONE WHO GETS CONTRACTED OUT. DOESN'T MAKE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY. THEY NEED THEN OUR SOCIAL SERVICE NET TO HELP THEM. WHAT I'M TELLING YOU I'VE JUST MANY MY LIVE NEXT TO HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK FOR FAR LESS THAN THEY DESERVE. WILL BE FOR A HAND UP NOT A HAND OUT. LET'S REWARD THE HARD WORK OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHEN I HEAR THE TERM USED BY SOMEONE OF FLEXIBILITY THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE UBER CODE FORTY NINE BASIC NEEDS THAT WORKING FAMILIES NEED. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN GROWING FOR DECADES AND THERE'S MORE AND MORE AND MORE SUBCONTRACTING OUT AND THE CREATION OF CHEAP LABOR ON OUR CAMPUSES WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO A FEW NEW GOOD LEADERS AT THE BOARD OF REGENTS. THEY ARE NOT CALLING THE SHOTS. WHEN THEY NEED BACK UP FROM US THEY NEED BACK UP FROM US TO SHOW THAT WE BELIEVE THAT ALL WORKING MEN AND WOMEN SHOULD HAVE THE DECENT GOOD STANDARD OF LIVING. COLLEAGUES ASK FOR YOUR AYE SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE IN AN EVEN MORE DIFFICULT MEASURE FOR ME FRANKLY THE EASY THING TO DO WOULD BE TO JUST STOP THE ISSUE. OR TO EXCEED TO THE PRESSURE FROM OUTSIDE THIS BUILDING THAT SOME OF US HAVE BEEN FEELING OVER THE LAST. WEEK OR SO WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY EXPLANATION. FOR MY CONCERNS ABOUT. THE MEASURE AND NOT THE CAUSE BUT I CAN'T DO THAT. I OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION AND MORE IMPORTANTLY I THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE IN OUR GALLERY IN THOSE WHO HOPEFULLY ARE WATCHING OUTSIDE THIS BUILDING. AN EXPLANATION FOR OF MY CONCERNS AND AN EXPRESSION OF MY SUPPORT FOR A FIX. SHORTLY AFTER I WAS ELECTED IF MYMEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT ONE OF THE FIRST PICKET LINES AND ONE OF THE FIRST WORKER PROTESTS. I ADDRESSED WAS IN ASKS ME ACTION. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE. I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE IT WAS QUITE A METAMORPHOSIS FOR A- LABOR MANAGEMENT ATTORNEY FOR RIVERSIDE.FROM RIVERSIDE STRANGE HOW THINGS CHANGE IN OUR LIVES. I PARTICIPATED IN THAT PICKET LINE BECAUSE I RECOGNIZED AT THAT TIME AND I CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THAT PRIOR ADMINISTRATIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAVE FOR DECADES FAILED TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF SOME OF UC'S MOST VALUABLE. BUT LOWEST PAID EMPLOYEES CONCERNS ABOUT PAY CONCERNS ABOUT JOB DISPLACEMENT CONCERNS ABOUT BENEFITS AMONG OTHER ISSUES. THESE ARE CERTAINLY NOT THE ACTIONS THAT WE EXPECT. FROM ANYONE IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WHEN I REVIEWED THE A. C. A. FOURTEEN THIS PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT I DID SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE THE PERSPECTIVE OF TRYING TO HELP THOSE WHO NEED HELP THE MOST. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO DO IN THIS CAPITAL. IN DOING SO IN A NOD TO THE PROPONENTS OF THIS MEASURE I RECOGNIZE THE LONG HOURS IN THE EXTREMELY HARD WORK. PUT INTO TRYING TO GET THIS THING RIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY AS I REVIEWED I NOTED SOME STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES IN THIS MEASURE THAT COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION AND HARM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. SEOUL IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE BUT I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHTED WHAT IS THIS PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT DO AT ITS CORE IT PROHIBITS CONTRACTING FOR SERVICES UNDER SOME VERY VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. LET'S TAKE A DEEPER LOOK. THE BILL THIS PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT COVERS ALL UC CONTRACT WORKERS PAID TO PERFORM SUPPORT SERVICES AT VARIOUS UC FACILITIES INCLUDING UC MEDICAL CENTERS CLINICS RESEARCH FACILITIES AND LABORATORIES SO IN ADDITION TO IMPACTING THE AVAILABILITY OF WORKERS AT UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT WORKERS PROVIDING PATIENT CARE SERVICES THAT ARE YOU SEE MEDICAL SERVICE AROUND THE STATE OUR TOP TIER HOSPITALS PROVIDING CRITICAL CARE. TO OUR MOST SERIOUSLY ILL. ARE VERY SICK. AND OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS. IN MANY CASES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROVIDING CARE AND EMERGENCY BASIS THAT FRANKLY CANNOT BE OBTAINED ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE AND THE PATIENT'S CENSUS AT THESE HOSPITALS CAN VERY FROM DAY TO DAY. AND EVEN FROM OUR OUR. ARE YOU SEE MEDICAL CENTERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THESE CHANGES IN CRITICAL PATIENT LOADS IMMEDIATELY RIGHT NOW NOT NEXT WEEK BECAUSE THEY MUST ACCEPT PATIENTS THAT SHOW UP AT THE DOOR AND PROVIDE CARE THEY SIMPLY CAN'T SAY WAIT A DAY OR TWO UNTIL WE FIND SOMEONE. TO DO SO. SO HOW DOES THIS PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FORCE UC TO DEAL WITH THAT QUICKLY MOVING TARGET AT THESE HEALTH CENTERS. YOU SEE MAY CONTRACT FOR SUPPORT SERVICES ONLY IF CONTRACTING IS NECESSARY TO DEAL WITH SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES OUTLINED IN THIS AMENDMENT INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING. TO SUPPLY THE UNIVERSITY WITH A LICENSED CLINICALLY TRAINED WORKERS FOR A CLINICAL REGISTRY. HOW THEY USE THAT'S WHAT THEY USED TO GET TEMPORARY WORKERS WHEN THEIR LISTS OF PART TIME PER DIEM WORKERS ARE INSUFFICIENT. AND TO ADDRESS A BONA FIDE EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MAY INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO INSURING THE CONTINUOUS OPERATIONS OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE TO ADDRESS LIFE THREATENING SITUATIONS DURING AN EMERGENCY. AMONG A FEW OTHER LISTED SITUATIONS. THE USE OF CONTRACTING AUTHORITIES TO SECURE WORKERS TO DEAL WITH THIS BONA FIDE EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCE OR THE USE OF A REGISTRY TO DEAL WITH THE CRITICAL PERSONNEL SHORTAGE IS ONLY PERMITTED IF WE FIRST AUTHORIZED SUCH ACTION A BILL WHICH WE PASSED IN THIS LEGISLATURE. AND WHICH IS THEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO FACT CHECK ME ON THE POINT AND I DON'T BLAME YOU. SECTION NINE POINT FIVE C. ONE STATES IN PERTINENT PART THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MAY CONTRACT FOR. CONTRACT LABOR TO PERFORM SUPPORT SERVICES ONLY IF AUTHORIZED TO DO SO BY STATUTE. NOW THEY'RE VERY CERTAINLY VARIOUS LEVELS A BONA FIDE EMERGENCIES BUT IMAGINE HAVING TO WAIT FOR OUR BILL PROCESS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO EMERGE ANY EMERGENCY. PARTICULARLY IN EMERGENCY AT A HEALTH CARE FACILITY. NOT PERHAPS A LIST OF PART TIME PER DIEM EMPLOYEES. WILL BE SUFFICIENT. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF IT ISN'T. CLEARLY WE HAVE TO ADDRESS WORKER CONCERNS. CLEARLY WE HAVE TO PROTECT ALL WORKERS INCLUDING THOSE AT UC PARTICULARLY OUR HARDEST WORKING LOWEST PAID AND MOST VULNERABLE BECAUSE THAT'S OUR JOB AND CLEARLY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS FAILED TO DO SO FOR DECADES. BUT THIS PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT JUST DOESN'T WORK. OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO EMERGENCIES OF THE NATURE OF THE REQUIRED RESPONSE BUT IF THE PROPONENTS ARE WRONG IN THEIR PREDICTIONS AS TO THE IMPACT ON ARE YOU SEE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND THIS NEW PROCESS WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT I'VE IDENTIFIED. WHICH IS FLOOD. NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. OUR EFFORT TO DO SO IN THE PROCESS TO DO SO WILL BE HERCULEAN. AND WE JUST CAN'T WAIVE IT. THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY IN THE FORM OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO IT TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES THAT ARE ATTEMPTED TO BE ACHIEVED HERE WE NEED TO TAKE BETTER CARE AND PAY BETTER ATTENTION TO THE LANGUAGE WHEN WE DRAFT AMENDMENTS TO OUR STATE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE- FOR THOSE OF US. CERTAINLY HERE WE KNOW LANGUAGE FRANKLY IS IMPORTANT. SO UNFORTUNATELY I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AS DRAFTED AT THIS POINT HOWEVER I COMMIT TO WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH THE PROPONENTS THE UC REGENTS IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO PIN DOWN A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THE ISSUES IS ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS IN A MORE CRAFT CAREFULLY CRAFTED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND STAND READY TO DO SO AND HAVE BEEN STANDING READY TO DO SO DURING THE LAST WEEK OR SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS. OBVIOUSLY IF THIS MEASURE PASSES TODAY AND IS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS WELL ASSUMING I'M STILL HERE. I'LL DO MY BEST TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRE AND OTHER EMERGENCIES THAT WE HAVE INDOOR AND SEEMINGLY AND DERON INCREASING BASIS MONTH AFTER MONTH. COORDINATE WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE SCHEDULE SO WE CAN PASS AN APPROPRIATE BILL. TO TAKE CARE OF THESE ISSUES BEFORE IT GETS WORSE. I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN PERMANENTLY FIX THIS ISSUE FOR THOSE IMPACTED IN IN IN A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. MONTH JUST NOT THIS WAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU CENTER STIR. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. AS A AS A CAL GRAD. GO BEARS ANYBODY. AND AS A FORMER TEACHER AT UCLA I HAVE DEEP AFFECTION FOR THIS SYSTEM I THINK IT IS THE FINEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. AND I DON'T INTEND. WITH THE VOTE HERE TODAY. THAT WE BREAK THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN FACT I THINK WE CAN STRENGTHEN IT. I WANTED TO ADDRESS TWO ISSUES ONE OF WHICH IS ABOUT MONEY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FISCAL ANALYSIS ON THIS MEASURE IT TALK ABOUT A ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR IMPACT OF THIS LEGISLATION. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE OUTPUT OF THIS UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THE SCALE OF ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY THE SOCIAL MOBILITY THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY ENABLE. I THINK THAT IS A MORE THAN FILLABLE GAP. AND IN MY VIEW. WE'VE BEEN SHORT CHANGING THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FOR TOO LONG. I AM VERY EXCITED THAT WE MAY BE PASSING A AN EDUCATION BONDS. THAT WOULD PUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION GOING FORWARD. WE KNOW THE BUILDINGS ARE STARTING TO FAIL THERE SEISMIC ISSUES UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA UCLA AND BERKELEY IN OTHER CAMPUSES. BUT EVEN ON AN ANNUAL BUDGET CYCLE WE GO THROUGH EVERY YEAR. I THINK VOTING FOR THIS MEASURE ENTAILS AN OBLIGATION TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE FOR THIS LEGISLATURE. TO HELP FILL THIS GAP. BUT WHAT I WANNA SAY IS THAT. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. OUR WORKERS FAIRLY AND HAVING A FIRST CLASS UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. I THINK WE CAN DO BOTH. I SHOWED UP ON CAMPUS. I FIRST YEAR LAW SCHOOL ON BANCROFT IN MEMBER WALKING OUT TO GET A BITE TO EAT AT THE INTERNATIONAL HOUSE WHICH IS RIGHT UP THE STREET I SAW THESE FOLKS IN GREEN. STANDING OUT ON THE STREET. I WONDERED WHO ARE WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE. SO I EIGHT I STARTED CONVERSATION AND IT TURNS OUT. THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO KEPT MY SCHOOL CLEAN. MADE MY CAMPUS SAFE. SO I COULD KEEP MY HEAD IN THE BOOKS THEY GRINDED. AND FOR STUDENTS. FACULTY ADMINISTRATORS OR EVEN US IS LEGISLATORS TO PRETEND LIKE THOSE PEOPLE ARE INVISIBLE JUST WRONG. SO. WHEN WE VOTE HERE TODAY WHEN I TAKE THIS VOTE I'LL BE THINKING OF THOSE PEOPLE UP THE STREET. TO WORK DAY IN AND OUT TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM GO. BUT I DO NOT THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE. A FATAL BLOW. TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY ESTABLISH THE MORAL HIGH GROUND FOR THIS UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND TRULY FORM A PARTNERSHIP. THAT WILL REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL STATUTORY WORK ON OUR PART. I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE OUR NEEDS FOR ENHANCED FLEXIBILITY. AND THAT EXPRESS STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION TO ALLOW FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP IN. FOR A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES NOT ONLY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE BROUGHT UP BUT ALSO I BELIEVE IN NINE POINT FIVE G. TALKS ABOUT THE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS ACT. I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE AMPLE FLEXIBILITY FOR US HERE TO STEP UP BUT WE CAN'T JUST TAKE THIS VOTE AND WALK AWAY. TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY STATUTORILY TO MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO BE EXCELLENT. AND GROWS ITSELF. SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE HERE TODAY. BUT I HOPE WE CAN START TO TURN THE PAGE AND END THIS YEAR OF ENMITY THAT IS PLAGUE IS UNIVERSITY FOR FAR TOO LONG. WE DO NOT NEED TO BE AT ODDS. AND THERE IS A TABLE SOMEWHERE WE CAN ALL SIT DOWN. AND I HOPE FOR MY FRIENDS OF THE REGION'S OR THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS UNIVERSITY. THEY WILL TAKE THIS NOT AS SOME REVIEW. BUT AS A CHARGE THE COME TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE. AND FIND A WAY TO WORK WITH US TO TRULY MAKE THIS UNIVERSITY THE GYM THAT IT IS. THANK YOU. SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT SENATORS SIDE RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS ACA I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE HERE ARE GRADUATES OF THE YEAR FOR THE CALIFORNIA AND IT HAD CERTAINLY TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE THERE I ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NOTS HOWEVER I SERVED AS A FACULTY MEMBER AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE SERVED ON IS AFFECTING THEIR FULL TIME FACULTY MEMBER AT THE MERCY CALIFORNIA. AFFECTED BEEN TOLD US OF FIRST FULL TIME FACULTY MEMBER UC'S EVER BEEN ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE BUT IF SOMEONE FIND SOMEONE ELSE LET ME KNOW AND I STAND SUPPORT. ACTUALLY FOR. BOTH AS A FORMER FACULTY MEMBER AND ALSO AS A PHYSICIAN BECAUSE I KNOW MANY PEOPLE BROUGHT UP THE HEALTH SYSTEMS. SO CERTAINLY AS A FACULTY MEMBER I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE TEACH OUR STUDENTS. AND SET A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR THEM AS TO HOW WE DO BUSINESS. AT OUR STATE RUN UNIVERSITY OUR STATE UNIVERSITY OUR PREMIER THAT CROWN JEWEL WE CALL DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND SO WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE. ARE WE SETTING OUR STUDENTS WHEN THE UNIVERSITY. DECIDES TO LAY OFF EMPLOYEES REPLACING THE CONTRACT WORKERS OR EVEN HIGHER CONTRACT WORKERS INSTEAD OF EXPANDING THEIR EMPLOYMENT WORKFORCE. THE. NOW CERTAINLY THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE ARE TEMP YELP AND THERE IT'S OUTLINED HERE THAT YOU MAY HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE A CERTAIN EVENT OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU MAY NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE TEACH OUR STUDENTS AND THE LEARNERS WHO ARE AT THE MERCY CALIFORNIA HOW ONE CAN DO BUSINESS AND YES WE HEAR IS THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP SUPPORT. OUR UNIVERSITY IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO ADHERE TO THE VALUES. I DO APPRECIATE THAT MY GOOD FRIEND TO STOCKING THE BILL FROM SANTA CLARITA HAS POINTED OUT THAT ACTUALLY THE FINANCIAL COST. IS ACTUALLY BEARABLE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY. AND SO I DO THINK AS A FACULTY MEMBER. WHO WANTS TO NOT ONLY JUST TEACH. MY LEARNERS THROUGH LECTURES ARE OTHER EDUCATIONAL. ALL ACT. THAT WE SHOULD SET THAT EXAMPLE AND I THINK THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND THIS IDEA OF EQUITY. BECAUSE WHAT THIS. MANY DOES AND MANY OF YOU SPOKE TO THE FACT THAT BY THE WAY I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE SAID WELL IS THERE A RUSH TO JUDGMENT HERE. I MEAN THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME I MEAN THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE TIME THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE EVER GOT THE LEGISLATURE WENT. BEFORE SOME OF YOU ARE IN THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE I MEAN THIS IS NOT A RUSH TO JUDGMENT THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE SET THAT EXAMPLE NOW I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE ALSO RAISE THE ISSUE ABOUT THE MED CENTER'S. AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND- OTHER POSITION YOU PRACTICED NOT ONLY OUTPATIENT BUT ALSO INFORMATION I DID YOU KNOW THE WORD ATTENDING THAT OTHER THINGS. AND BELIEVE ME YES I AGREE. THE IT GOES UP THE **** OUT IN TERMS OF THE DEMANDS RIGHT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT PERHAPS THE BIGGEST LIMITATION ANY CAPACITY IF SOME. NO MAJOR EVENT HAPPENS IS NOT JUST STAFF. ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY THAT'S ONE PLACE IT'S ACTUALLY THE FACILITY ITSELF. AND SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT ACTUALLY THE- UC HOSPITALS WE THOUGHT TALK ABOUT ME EVER VERY SPECIALTY PROGRAMS. THOSE ARE NOT THE ONES WHO ARE SUFFERING THE LARGE SWINGS IN DEMAND OKAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MERCHANTS YOU ROOM THERE'S A DISASTER OR SOMETHING. RIGHT WE DO HAVE FIRST OF ALL PLANS AND THAT INVOLVES ACTUALLY THE EXISTING STAFF. SO THERE THERE IS ANY WE'RE WE ACTUALLY DO PLAN FOR AND ORGANIZED TO HANDLE VARIATIONS IN PATIENT VOLUME INCLUDING EVEN. THINGS TO HAPPEN TO THE VIRGIN THREW ME OFF THERE IS A SCHOOL BUS ACCIDENTS WE HAVE WE ARE WE ARE ORGANIZED TO RESPOND TO THAT WITH EXISTING STAFF NOW. THERE IS MENTION IN THE AC ITSELF THE SAYS IF THERE'S ACTUALLY A LARGE SCALE EMERGENCY THE GOVERNOR CAN DECLARE AND WEAK AND THE UNIVERSITY CAN'T PULL IN MORE PEOPLE TO DO THAT THE HANDLE THAT AS WELL SO CERTAINLY IF THERE IS THERE IS IT IS A LARGE SCALE EVENTS WHERE WE DO NEED. TO BRING IN MANY MORE PEOPLE INTO THE FACILITY THERE IS THAT CAPACITY AS WELL. SO. NOW MAYBE THERE YOU KNOW MAYBE WE DO NEED TO LEGISLATIVE FIX IF THIS IS PASSED BY THE VOTERS AND POINT OUT THIS GOES TO THE VOTERS BUT- I'D- IT THIS IS NOT. A THIS ACA IS NOT GOING TO CRIPPLE. ARE YOU SEE HEALTH SYSTEM TO SOMEONE WHO'S ACTUALLY WORKED THERE OKAY AND SO. I THINK THAT THIS RESOLUTIONS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT RESOLVES A PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME AT UC. CLEARLY LIKE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IT'S GONNA GO TO THE VOTERS BUT I AM ALSO PROUD OF THE FACT THAT. WE CAN ALSO IT HAS THOSE SPACES WITHIN THEIR FOR US TO FINE TUNE THE PARTS THAT NEED TO BE FINE TUNED IN THERE BUT I THEY DO WANT TO JUST SAY AGAIN I SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE AS BOTH A FACULTY MEMBER WE'D HAVE TO SET THE RIGHT EXAMPLE AND ALSO AS A PHYSICIAN I WANT TO SEE. OUR STAFF THE STAFF THAT'S ACTUALLY TAKING HELPING US TAKE CARE TO PATIENTS. WE NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO BOTH KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. RIGHT YELP BELIEVE NOT IF YOU'RE THE PERSON HAVE TO CLEAN UP BLOOD VOMIT UNIT YOU ACTUALLY SORRY AND- SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN A HOSPITAL. YOU KNOW YOU YOU IT'S NOT YOU DON'T JUST PULL SOMEONE OFF THE STREET THEY NEED TO NOT HANDLE IT. IT AND BUT THERE SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THEY'RE BEING PAID THE SAME TO GAIN THE SAME BENEFITS THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT EVERYONE'S IN IT TOGETHER THAT'S HOW HEALTH SYSTEM WORKS ALOT THINGS WORK BUT THAT'S HOW HEALTH SYSTEM WORK. AND SO THIS. I THINK IS IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD AND I HEARD TONIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT FISHING YEAH YOU RECOGNIZE ME. THE YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS MORNING. WE HAVE A LOT OF AGREEMENT. ON THE FLOOR HERE TODAY THAT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY ACCURATE. AND I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND- THE CO AUTHOR OF THE SENATE CO AUTHOR FROM SANTA THREE TO. AND HIS WORK THIS YEAR ON THIS PROJECT ALONG WITH THE ASSEMBLY AUTHOR. IN BRINGING THIS ISSUE TO US AND- MAKING IT KNOWN. AND HIS ADVOCACY. FOR THIS TODAY. BUT THE I THINK WITH THE MAIN SOURCE OF THE DISAGREEMENT ON THIS IS WERE USING A SLEDGEHAMMER. TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE. SOLVED WITH A SCALPEL AND. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE EARLIER IN THE DEBATE REGARDING FIRST CLASS WORKERS. AND I DO AGREE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AGREE DESERVES THE VERY BEST AT FIRST CLASS WORKERS AND THE SHORTCOMINGS THEIR OF ON SOME OF THE POSITIONS THAT THAT THAT. COMMENT WAS REGARDING. BUT LET ME TALK ABOUT SOME FIRST CLASS WORKERS THAT THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY AS A SLEDGE HAMMER IS GONNA AFFECT. AND. MOST LIKELY REMOVE THEIR PROFESSIONALISM FROM. THE UC SYSTEM THIS MEASURE WILL INCREASE I HAS BEEN ARGUED IS ALREADY THE HIGH COSTS ON PARENTS WHO WANT TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO UC. THE SAVINGS AT THE UC CURRENTLY RE REAL REALIZES FROM CON FROM CONTRACTING WILL BE GONE. AND THEY'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT UP SOMEWHERE. AND PART OF IT NO DOUBT WILL BE TUITION INCREASES. AS MEASURE ALSO BRING DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS TO A NUMBER OF RESEARCH PROGRAMS. AND THIS IS THE FIRST CLASS WORKERS OF WHICH I STARTED WITH ONE EXAMPLE FROM MY REGION OF THE STATE IS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA A SAN DIEGO SCRIPTS INTO THE INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY. FIRST THIS MEASURE WOULD GOT SCRIPTS ABILITY TO CONTRACT WITH CALL QUALIFIED MARINERS TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR FULL TIME EMPLOYEES. WHICH IS VITAL TO THEIR MISSION OF EXPLORING OUR OCEANS AND STUDYING THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE SLEEP SEA LEVEL RISE AND STORM SURGES WHICH THEY'RE DOING VERY GREAT WORK ON BY THE WAY. YEAH THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MARINERS THAT CAN SET SAIL. THAT MEANS THAT THEY CANNOT CONDUCT THEIR RESEARCH. SCRIPT TIRES PART TIME TEMPORARY MARINERS ON A PER DIEM BASIS FROM THE UNIVERSITY NATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHIC LABOR SYSTEM. THESE ARE WELL QUALIFIED AND CREDENTIALED MARINERS THAT URGED CHOOSING TO WORK IN THIS PART TIME SYSTEM INSTEAD OF THE TRADITINAL SCHEDULES THAT DO NOT SUIT THEM FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY CHOOSE. BUT THEY DON'T STUDENT. ADDITIONALLY THE TEMPORARY AND SHORT TERM SUBCONTRACTORS THAT HELP REPAIRTHE INSTITUTE SHIPS WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED BECAUSE THEY'RE PROJECTS OFTEN TAKE LONGER THAN TEN DAYS. SCRIPT DOES NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO FIX THEIR OWN VESSELS. NOR DO THEY HAVE A THE A QUALIFIED SHIPYARD IN WHICH TO MAKE THOSE REPAIRS. THE SUBCONTRACTORS RUN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES AND HAVE NO INTENTION OF BECOMING EMPLOYEES OF THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. HAVE SCRIPTS CANNOT CONTRACT WITH THEM THEY HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER CLIENTS THAT WILL. THE LOSS OF EXPERTISE WILL FOR SCRIPTS TO CUT BACK ON THE NUMBER OF SHIPS IT SALES AND THE NUMBER OF VOYAGES IT UNDERTAKES. CONSEQUENTLY THE STORE SCRIPT THE STORIED STRIPS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL ITS ROBUST RESEARCH MISSION. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I AGREE WITH THE AS GOOD SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE THAT F WE CAN COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND USE A SCALPEL INSTEAD OF A SLEDGE HAMMER I THINK WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED TODAY I ORIGINAL VOTE THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND I RISE AND I'M EXCITED TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL. I WANT TO REPEAT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I MADE WHEN WE HEARD THIS BILL IN COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW WHO ARE WE AS A GROUP WHO ARE WE AS LEGISLATORS IF WE CAN ALLOW. A GROUP OF WORKERS TO BE TREATED AS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS. AND THIS IS WHAT I SEE THIS AS IS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE UNIVERSITIES RUN SURE WE NEED THE TEACHERS SURE WE NEED ADMINISTRATORS BUT IF ALL THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN THE GALLERY WITH US TODAY. AND THE HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF MORE WHO COULDN'T BE HERE DIDN'T SHOW UP TO WORK EVERY DAY. THE UC'S WOULD CLOSE THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RUN SO WHY IS IT THAT WE DON'T VALUE THEM. LIKE WE VALUE OTHER PEOPLE. AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I THINK IS INTERESTING AND VERY CONCERNING TO ME. IS THAT WE HAVE OUR FUTURE LEADERS GETTING AN EDUCATION THERE AND WHAT ARE WE TEACHING THEM ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE IF WE DON'T VALUE ALL WORK. THIS IS ABOUT VALUING ALL WORK AND MAKING SURE THAT WORKERS ARE PAID A LIVING WAGE. FIRST ONE TO REPEAT OME OF THINGS THAT I SAID. IN COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. BUT I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE THINGS I HEARD I THINK I HEARD SOMEONE SAY THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST WE'RE DOING THIS AND IT SHOULD BE COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED. BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND SOMEONE COLLECT CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. THEY'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING FOR TWELVE YEARS SO THAT'S OVER A DECADE THAT THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN TRYING TO COME TO RESOLUTION. I THINK THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME AND I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME THAT WE DO SOMETHING. WE TALK ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS BUT WHAT ABOUT TALKING ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE WORKERS AT UC LET'S TALK ABOUT DOING SOMETHING FOR THEM THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE SURE. OUR YOUNG MINDS ARE ABLE TO COME TO THESE UNIVERSITIES AND BE OUR FUTURE LEADERS. THE MEMBERS IT'S WITH GREAT PRIDE THAT I AM A CO AUTHOR AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SEEING NO OTHER MIKE'S UP I BELIEVE DISCUSSION HAS SEIZED. SENATOR WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE THOUGHTFUL AND CIVIL DEBATE THIS MORNING ON ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. THE ONE THING I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT NO ONE ARGUED THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT EDUCATION ABOUT HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR STUDENTS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE SHOULD HAVE HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL PEOPLE. AND IN THIS MEASURE GETS US ONE STEP CLOSER TO HAVING AN EQUITABLE SOCIETY I LIKE TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT EQUITY EQUITY IT MUST BE ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST. TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION. IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT SUPERSEDES THIS ANY ANY OTHER MEASURE IN THE GOVERNOR HAS THE RIGHT TO CALL THAT. IN IN TERMS OF FLEXIBILITY UP TURNED TO PAY AGAIN PAGE FIVE LINE THIRTY NINE SEE NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL PRECLUDE THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA OR ANY CAMPUS OR OTHER ENTITY OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FROM USING PER DIEM UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES TO COMPLEMENT CAREER IN LIMITED POSITION UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES. WHAT IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN STAFFING LEVELS FOR TEMPORARY AND EMERGENCY PERIODS. SO THAT DOES CREATE FLEXIBILITY AND IT DOES ADDRESS THE MAYOR THE MARINERS SITUATION WITH WITH SCRAPS. TEN AND OBVIOUSLY THE MEDICAL STAFF. IN TERMS OF FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY THIS MEASURE IS PRUDENT. I HAVE A WHOLE LIST HERE OF ABUSES AT THE UC SYSTEM HAS DONE IN THE PAST I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THEM YET SINCE IT'S THE LAST DAY SESSION BUT THEY CURRENTLY CLAIM THAT THESE CONTRACTS. US FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS ABC A FOURTEEN WOULD LATER ON ANOTHER A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. HERE'S A THE FAX OUR OWN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE STAFF AND MIKE GYMNAST WHO WAS THE DIRECTOR OF FISCAL DIRECTOR FOR GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER HAVE LOOKED IT LOOKED AT THE INFORMATION AND THE TOTAL COST OF THESE LABOR CONTRACTS ARE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. WE'LL TAKE YOU SEE AT THEIR WORD THAT IT'S GONNA COST ANOTHER A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION SO WE ADD THAT IN. THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS LESS. THEY CLAIM THEY'RE PAYING TODAY SO THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY TUITION. INCREASES ON THIS MEASURE THIS MEASURE. AT WORST IS FACE FISCALLY EVEN MAYBE POTENTIALLY EVEN SAVE MONEY FOR THE SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW THAT THE PRO TEM IN THE SENATOR FROM SENSEI TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING BATTLE FOR DECADES. FOR DECADES. FOR ME I LOVE BASKETBALL AND I'M ALSO OLD SO I REMEMBER BASKETBALL BEFORE THERE WAS A SHOT CLOCK. AND I PERSONALLY AM UCLA BASKETBALL FAN BUT THOSE WHO WERE OLDER REMEMBER DEAN SMITH AND IN NORTH CAROLINA WHICH IS ALSO HISTORICAL POWER. AND WILL AND DEAN SMITH CREATED THE FOUR CORNERS OFFENSE AND WHAT THAT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS NO SHOT CLOCK THE MINUTE HE GOT THE LEAD. HE PUT HIS PEOPLE IN THE CORNER AND THEY WOULD JUST THROW THE BALL AROUND TO KEEP IT FROM THE OPPONENTS. LADIES AND GENTLEMENTHAT'S WHAT THE UC REGENTS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR FOUR DECADES EVEN PLAYING FOUR CORNERS WITH OUR WORKERS AND IT'S WRONG IT'S GOT TO STOP WE NEED TO PASS THIS MEASURE TODAY AND PUT THEM ON THE SHOT CLOCK. IF THEY WANT TO FIX IN FOR THIS GOES TO VOTERS THEY CAN DO THAT BUT WE HAVE TO FORCE THEIR HAND THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP. I HAVE A MINUTES ABOUT RESPECT I STILL COME SPEAKER PREZ AND IF ANYBODY CAN GET IT DONE HE CAN GET IT DONE BUT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM EXTERNE COURAGE ME TO GET IT DONE. SO WITH THAT THIS IS EQUITABLE. IT'S KLAY PRUDENT INFIRM MY FRIENDS AND MY CAUCUS WILL TALK ABOUT THE BEST GOVERNMENT. IS A GOVERNMENT CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE. NOTHING IS CLOSER THAN LETTING THE VOTERS MAKE THIS DECISION. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON A CA FOURTEEN.

FOR MOVING A FILE ITEM FORTY THREES SENATOR HERTZBERG ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THE SIGHT OF. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN THIRTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN AND ACT REALLY INTO ELECTIONS. HERTZBERG WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THIS MEASURE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN SEEKS TO SAFEGUARD THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS A TASK THAT IS NOT ONLY BECOME MORE CHALLENGING WITH THE INCREDIBLE ADVANCEMENT IN TECHNOLOGY ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLING RECENTDEVELOPMENTS IS THE INVENTION AND PROLIFERATION. OF DEEP FAKES WHICH ARE EXTREMELY CONVINCING FABRICATED PHOTOS VIDEOS AUDIO RECORDINGS OF SOMEONE APPEARING TO SAY OR DO SOMETHING THAT THEY DID NOT. THE ABILITY TO TRIBUTE A SPEECH AND CONDUCT TO A CANDIDATE IS FALSE WITH HIS NEVER EVEN HAPPENED MAKES DEEP TAKES A POWERFUL AND DANGEROUS NEW TOOL IN THE ARSENAL OF THOSE WHO WANT TO WAGE MISSION FORMATION CAMPAIGNS. IN JANUARY OUR UNITED STATES DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DAN COATS WARNED THE DEEP BAKES WILL PROBABLY BE AMONG THE TACTICS USED TO DISRUPT THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS AND WITH THOSE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS AROUND THE CORNER. WE MUST DO MORE TO CURB THE PROLIFERATION OF DEEP FAKES OR OTHER MANIPULATED MEDIA. THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL ON THE READ IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS. A DEEP TAKE MEANS THAT THAT A MATERNAL DECEPTIVE AUDIO OR VISUAL MEDIA TO MEAN AN IMAGE OR RECORDING VISUAL RECORDING THAT HAS BEEN INTENTIONALLY MANIPULATED. TO ALTER THE APPEARANCE SPEECH YOUR CONDUCT OF A CANDID SO AS TO CREATE A SIGNIFICANT LIKELIHOOD OF CAUSING A REASONABLE PERSON TO UNDERSTAND OF EXPERIENCED EXPRESSION EXPRESSIVE CONDUCT CONTENT OF THE IMAGE OR RECORDING IN A MANNER THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT. FROM THE UNDERSTANDING OR EXPERIENCE THAT A PERSON WOULD HAVE HAD IF THE PERSON WE'RE HEARING OR SEEING ARE THE ON ALTERED ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE IMAGE OR RECORDING. IN THIS SAYS THAT YOU'VE GOT THIS THIS BASICALLY SAYS FOR SOME OF THE PERIOD OF SIXTY DAYS OF THE ELECTION. THAT MAKES IT ILLEGAL. THE LAST THING I WANT TO RAISE THE CONSTITUTIONAL OUT ALLEY THE ISSUE AND I WANT TO RAISE. A LETTER THAT WAS WRITTEN BY THE UNITED STATES THE U. S. C. C. BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW DEAN. ONE SHERMAN AND SKI AND WHAT HE SAID IS WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY BECAUSE X. IMPORTANT AS WE- TRY TO DEAL WITH THESE BALANCES ON THE FLOOR. ALTHOUGH THIS BILL WOULD REGULATE ITS ITS PROHIBITION OF DEEP THE IT REGULATE SPEECH. IS PROHIBITION OF DEEP TAKES WOULD NOT VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT. FALL SPEECH AT TIMES IS PROTECTED BUT OFTEN THE GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWED TO PROHIBITED WITHOUT RUNNING AFOUL OF THE CONSTITUTION. FOR EXAMPLE LYING IN THE COURT ROOM UNDER OATH PERJURY IS NOT PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT EVEN THOUGH IT SPEECH. THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN CLEAR. THE FALSE AND DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING HAS NO CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BOARD HAS SAID THAT SPEECH WHICH IS DEFAMATORY OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS PUBLIC FIGURES. HAS NOT FIRST ABED BUT PROTECTION. THE SPEED OF THE- BALL SIR AXE. OUT WITH RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE TRUTH. SIX IN THE PORTENTS OF PREVENTING WRONGFUL HARM TO REPUTATION AND PROTECTING THE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS JUSTIFIES. THAT LIABILITY FOR FALL SPEECH AB SEVEN THIRTY THE MATTER WHICH WE HAVE BEFORE US SERVE THESE PURPOSES AND USE THIS EXACT USES EXACT LEGAL STANDARD. IT PROHIBITS DEEP TAKES IN THE POLITICAL REALM APPLIES ONLY WHEN THE FALSE IMAGES WERE KNOWINGLY OR RECKLESSLY CREATED OR DISSEMINATE AND DISSEMINATED. THE TECHNOLOGY FOR DEEP TAKES ADVANCING QUICKLY THE LAW MUST BE KEPT UP. AND DEAL WITH THE SERIOUS PROBLEM I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR VERGES ON THIS ITEM. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. COUPLE OF A QUICK COMMENTS AND WE WITH YOUR TO WITH YOUR UP TO LIKE TO POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR OF IN HER TOWARD WERE TO TAKE QUESTION CERTAINLY THIS IS I THINK VERY TELLING OF OUR TIME WE NEED TO PROTECTIONS OF THIS OF THIS SORT. AND I THINK ALL OF US UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE CAN BLUR THE LINES BETWEEN ADVOCACY AND OUTRIGHT MANIPULATION AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT BEING AS IT IS WE'VE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING BUT THOSE DAYS. ARE ARE ARE CERTAINLY I THINK OF IN THE PAST GIVEN THE TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW IN THE INTERFERENCE THAT WE KNOW THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THE LAST ELECTION IT WILL CAN OCCUR IN ALL FUTURE ELECTIONS SO I THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL MY QUESTION TO THE FLOOR MANAGER ON THIS. IS. THE BONUS WILL THE ONUS MAY BE ON THE AGGRIEVED PARTY. TO VINDICATE THEMSELVES OR WILL THE MEDIA OUTLET. THAT RELEASES IT BE THE BE THOSE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. FOR THE PLIGHT. TO THE CHAIR THE PLAINTIFF WOULD HAVE TO PROVE BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF THERE WAS A BROADCASTER WHATEVER. THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THE PLAINTIFF IN THE CASE WHICH WOULD NOT BE THE BROADCASTER THE NEWS MEDIA IT. WOULD HAVE TO PUT WOULD HAVE TO PROVE. THAT THOSE WHO BROADCAST THIS OR PRINTED THIS DID SO WITH ACTUAL MALICE SO THE BURDEN WOULD BE ON THE PLAINTIFF IN THE STANDARD IS ABOUT THE HIGHEST STANDARD YOU COULD MAKE. BECAUSE IT IS VERY CHALLENGING THIS THIS WHOLE THING WE'VE GOT WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS JUST MIND NUMBINGLY DIFFICULT. WHERE WE HAVE THESE VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES OF FREE SPEECH BUT WE HAVE THEM BEING THAT THEY'RE BEING RECKLESSLY DISREGARDED TECHNOLOGY IN FOREIGN GOVERNMENT. SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO DO IT SO THIS APPEARS TO BE A PRETTY CAREFULLY CRAFTED AND NARROWER THAN THE OFFER ONE. MEASURE IN ORDER TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THOSE CONSTITUTION CONCERN SO. EXAMPLE. IMAGINE A IN A STEAMED LEADER IN OUR COMMUNITY. BOB HERTZBERG. ALL OF A SUDDEN IS PUT OUT THERE ON FACEBOOK AS BEING PRO REPUBLICAN. BALLOT IF THE WITH THE FACEBOOK ON POSTING OF THAT. WHICH FACEBOOK BE HELD TO ACCOUNT ARE ONLY IT WOULD BE THROUGH A NEWS OUTLET LIKE A MEDIA SOURCE. NO THE UNDER THE UNDER THE LAW THE UNDER SECTION TWO THIRTY OF THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT NO SOCIAL PLATFORMS OUR PLATFORMS ARE IMMUNE FROM LIABILITY UNDER THOSE THEORIES SO THAT IS PR EMPTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEY ARE NOT OTHERWISE LIABLE OR THIS IS DEFINITELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVEN THIRTY AND I THINK THAT THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION ENCAPSULATES THE REASON QUOTE THE INEVITABLE RESULT IF A. B. SEVEN THIRTY WERE TO BECOME LAW WOULD BE A PROFOUND CHILLING EFFECT ON POLITICAL SPEECH THE VERY THING. THE FIRST AMENDMENT WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT FOR THOSE REASONS SUPPORTING OUR CONSTITUTION OR TO NOTE VOTE AND AB SEVEN THIRTY. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SEEN IN HEARING NINE SOONER HERTZBERG WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE. THE POINT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE POINT ABOUT A CHILLING EFFECT IS IMPORTANT. VERY IMPORTANT THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND THIS IS THE REAL CHALLENGE THAT TECHNOLOGIES WE SAW THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IN WASHINGTON. BEING COMPLETELY MANIPULATED THROUGH A VIDEO THREE MILLION PEOPLE WATCH THAT AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ACCURATE AND TODAY THE TECHNOLOGY IS EVEN MORE SOPHISTICATED. AND SO THIS MEASURE HAS BEEN NARROWED IT IS BEST AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN I THINK THAT ONE SHERMAN IN SKIS A POINT OF VIEW THE DEAN OF THE LAW SCHOOL CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR. THE REASON I READ IT SAID IT BEST BECAUSE AND VERY SENSITIVE TO THOSE ISSUES. SO THE ARGUMENT IS IN SO MANY OF THESE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT ON THIS FLOOR THE LAST NUMBERS TODAY'S THESE DELICATE BALANCES. BALANCES IN TERMS OF RIGHTS OF FOLKS AND OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. AND SO NOW WE HAVE THIS NEW ISSUE WEAPON ISING THE INTERNET IN THE WAY THAT. NO ONE COULD EVER HAVE IMAGINED. AND SO HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HOW DO YOU BALANCE THESE THINGS THAT THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION NEVER WOULD HAVE EVER DREAMED OF. AND SO THE QUESTION IS I THINK AS IT'S NARROWLY DRAFTED TARGETS THE CORE POLITICAL SPEECH. WITHOUT REGARD TO LEGITIMACY COMMENTARY AND CRITICISM PARODY AND SATIRE REENACTMENTS OF REAL EVENTS. THE AND THE LIKE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE NOT BEING TAKEN ARE ARE NOT BEING DRAWN IN THIS IS ABOUT WHERE SOMEBODY ENGAGES THE MALICIOUS BEHAVIOR. ALL ON THE INTERNET. AND JUST IS COMPLETELY FALSE AND TAKES THE SITUATION WHERE IN THE VERY SUPREME COURT CASES IN THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN TOLD LIMITED. TO GIVE NEW TOOLS IN THAT REGARD AND I THINK BEING PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE. TO CHILL IN FACT I THINK IT STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE LAST YEAR I BOUGHT.

SOONER HILL MOVES THE CALL NEXT UP IS FILE ITEM FIFTY THREE SENATOR GLAZIER YOU'RE PREPARED FOR THIS MEASURE. THE SECRETARY WHEN YOU'RE READY PLEASE RATE ASSEMBLY BILL TEN EIGHTY SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER K. HAND AN ACT RELATING TO PARKS AND RECREATION. CENTER GLAZER FOR GEORGE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN THE BACK OF OUR QUE HAN IT'S A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION TO SELL A PORTION OF THE CARNEGIE STATE. VEHICLE RECREATION AREA FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES. IF THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES IT'S IN THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST. CURRENTLY THERE IS AN OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE PARKED RIGHT NEXT DOOR. HAS BEEN DOWN IN RECENT YEARS. THIS PARCEL THIS EXPANSION PARCEL HAS BEEN. UNDER LITIGATION FOR QUITE SOME TIME IT'S VERY CONTROVERSIAL. AND THIS BILL ALL IT DOES IS IT DOESN'T REQUIRE A SALE IT SAYS THAT IF THE DEPARTMENT. DETERMINES IN THEIR INTERESTS THAT. SALE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. AND KEEP IN MIND THAT WE HAVE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF OFF ROAD ENTHUSIASTS ADVISING THE DEPARTMENT IS THE OFF HIGHWAY. VEHICLE COMMISSION AND SO THE DEPARTMENT IN CONSULTATION OF THE COMMISSION THEY MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELL THE PROPERTY NOW ONE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL IS IT SETS A MINIMUM SELLING PRICE. DOESN'T THAT JUST FOLLOW THE TYPICAL SALES SURPLUS LAND PROTOCOLS IT SAYS YES THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN BUT IT CAN'T KILL ANYTHING BELOW THAN WHAT THE PURCHASE PRICE WISE. I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS MEASURE SUPPORTED BY CITY IN AND THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA. BECAUSE IT IS SPECIAL ECOLOGICAL VALUE OF THIS PARCEL THE SIERRA CLUB THE NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY THE AUDUBON SOCIETY OF ALL COME OUT IN SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BORCHERS. QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR OUR OR OF FIELDS OF FOR MANAGER PLEASE ENTER GLAZER WE TO QUESTION HAPPY TO YES. IS THERE ANY REVERSIONARY LANGUAGE THAT SHOULD A PURCHASER ASSUME TITLE THAT WOULD KEEP THEM FROM SELLING IT TO BY ANY OTHER ENTITY. AND POCKETING THE FAIR MARKET VALUE. I DON'T THINK THAT THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION THERE'S NO INTENTION TO HAVE THAT BE THE CASE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S A RULES IN WHICH WE DISPOSE OF SURPLUS PROPERTY THE STATE. PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TO GO TO A PUBLIC AGENCIES FIRST SO THE IDEA THAT IT COULD EVER BE USED FOR THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY WOULD BE VERY LOW THIS IS RURAL LAND IS NOT URBAN LAND THIS IS OUT IN THE HINTERLANDS OF. OF ALAMEDA COUNTY I DOES IT HAVE THE TRADITIONAL DEVELOPING RIGHTS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN THAT TYPE OF AREA SO I DON'T THINK THAT. ISSUE IS REALLY IN PLAY AND CERTAINLY THE DEPARTMENT COULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT IF THEY WERE TO CHOOSE TO BUY. DECLARE THE LAND SURPLUS. ARE MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH A- LAND LIKE THIS. THAT IF YOU'RE A- BASS LINE IS THE PURCHASE PRICE BUT IT'S- THAT'S TWENTY. YEARS DATED. WHY THEY WOULD BE USING THE FAIR MARKET VALUE TODAY. AND THE LAST WOULD BE A REVERSIONARY CLAUSE THAT THE PROPERTY OF SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY OR INTENT TO BE SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY REVERT TO THE STATE. OF IN OR SOME SORT OF CONSERVANCY I WOULD SAY THIS THAT IF THAT WAS EVER AN ISSUE I'VE CERTAINLY HAS MY COMMITMENT AND I'LL CHECK WITH THE AUTHOR AS WELL. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WOULD NOT THAT'S NOT A PURPOSE OF WHAT THIS MEAN THAT MEASURE INTENDS TO DO AND WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT THAT TO BE THE RESULT OF A IT'S REALLY AN ATTEMPT TO. IF THEY DECIDE THE CONFLICT HAS GONE ON TOO LONG THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS LITIGATION HAS GONE ON FOR TOO LONG. THAT THAT THERE'S A THAT IT CAN BE PRESERVED IN CONSERVATION AND PERMANENTLY THAT'S REALLY THE GOAL TO GIVE THEM THAT OPTION. IF THEY SO CHOOSE. CENTER STONE. I THINK IT WAS FAIR IF I IF I MAY ASK THE AUTHOR OF THE LORD FOR MANAGER QUESTION PLEASE. WE TAKE A QUESTION YES THANK YOU CENTER. AND I'M JUST USING MY RECALL HERE OR THE LAST TIME WE HAVE THIS BEING DISCUSSED I WAS OPPOSED TO IT BECAUSE IF I REMEMBER CORRECT AND I. FIND THE TO BE CORRECTED PLEASE CORRECT ME. THAT IT WAS HV FEES AT WERE ORIGINALLY CHOIR DID USE TO BUY THIS PROPERTY. IF THAT IS THE CASE AND IF NINE MILLION DOLLARS IS IN FACT THE SELLING PRICE OF THE PROPERTY WITH THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS BE RETURNED TO THE A TREE FUN. SO WE CAN MITIGATE THE LOSS OF ALWAYS SHE LAND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR QUESTION. AND YES THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL IS THAT IF THE PROPERTY WAS SOLD AGAIN THAT'S AN OPTION THE DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE. NOT A REQUIREMENT OF THIS BILL. THAT THE FUNDS TO BE RETURNED TO THE O. H. BE FINE TO BE USED FOR ONLY HD PURPOSES. AND SO THOSE WHO ARE ENTHUSIASTS OF THE SPORT IN THIS BILL IS IN NO WAY AS- AN ATTEMPT TO A TAKE AWAY THAT RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. YOU WOULD YOU WOULD GET RESOURCES THAT ARE LOCKED DOWN NOW GOING FOR NOTHING. AND HE'D BE ABLE TO GET THOSE RESOURCES BACK AND HOPEFULLY FIND OTHER APPROPRIATE PLACES TO SUPPORT THAT ACTIVITY IN THAT WOULD BE AND THAT. AND THAT'S THE BILL PROVIDES FOR THAT. THANK YOU. SENATOR I APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING THE QUESTION. I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE THAT SINCE EACH THE FUNDS TO PAY FOR THIS PROPERTY IF IT'S TO BE SOLD AT THE OCEAN GO BACK INTO THE HV FUN TO MAYBE FIND MORE APPROPRIATE TO A PIECE OF LAND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE KNOW OVER TWENTY YEARS SAID. THINGS HAPPEN THINGS BECOME EITHER MORE URBANITES ARE THINGS GOING TO HABITAT AS WE'VE SEEN IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE HABITT CONSERVATION PLANS IN THE COUNTRY WITH A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND ACRES SLATED TO BE PUT INTO CONSERVATION BUT AS A FORMER EACH Vì USER AND MANY THAT USE EACH PIECE OF MY DISTRICT. I'M PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS WILL GO BACK INTO THE WHICH THE FUND I HOPE THAT IF THERE IS A CAPITAL GAIN ON THIS PROPERTY THAT THE GOOD SENATOR WILL MAINTAIN ITS COMMITMENT WHICH I BELIEVE THAT HE WILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HD FUND HOPEFULLY WILL BE WE MADE WHOLE WITH THAT APPRECIATION AND WITH THAT I STAND IN SUPPORT OF. THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE CULTURE. I RISE AS A- PROUD. RESIDENT OF ALAMEDA COUNTY MISTER PRESIDENT RISE SINCE. OUR IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I THINK THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE CHEN THE UNDERSTAND THAT. ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS PASSED MEASURE D. WHICH LIMITS THE DEVELOPMENT ON ANY COUNTY OPEN SPACE. THE ONE HOUSING UNITS PER HUNDRED SO WHILE THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. DOESN'T HAVE REVISIONARY LANGUAGE IN IT THERE ARE THERE ARE IN PLACE PROTECTION SAID THAT THIS. PROPERTY WILL REMAIN ESSENTIALLY OPEN SPACE AGAIN I THINK THE FLOOR MANAGER. AND BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR HAS. HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ECOLOGICAL UNIQUENESS OF THIS PROPERTY WHICH IS THE- BEING PROTECTED UNDER OUR CURRENT RULES THE SG HAS THE ABILITY TO GIVE A DISCOUNT FOR OPEN SPACE LAND AND I THINK THAT THE DISCUSSION THIS VOCAL ONE WITH THE SG SHOULD MEASURE PASSED THIS HOUSE SINGLE WANTING TO GAIN THE GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE IS STILL BE A DISCUSSION ON THE VALUE THAT OPEN SPACE ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE LEGISLATION IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW ALL THE MONEY WILL GO TO THE OFF ROAD VEHICLE FUND SO IF THERE'S ANY SURPLUS THAT'S- NOT SURPLUS BY THE NEGOTIATED. AMOUNT AND THIS IS WILL BE FAIR BY IN ONE OF THE ARMS IS STATE GOVERNMENT SO I PLUG THE AUTHOR AND THE FLOOR MANAGER FOR THE HARD WORK TO PERSISTENT WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS HARD WORK ON THIS HE'S BEEN VERY CONSISTENT ON THAT. ALMOST TO A FAULT I THINK AND I JUST KNOW I WANT TO TALK TO THE PROCESS HERE. THIS BILL'S BEEN HEARD A COUPLE OF TIMES THIS YEAR. IT WAS HELD IN THE ASSEMBLY THE SENATE BILL WAS HERE.

AND THIS PARTICULAR BILLS HAD THREE HEARINGS IN THE SENATE PRIOR TO THE FLOOR DISCUSSION TODAY. AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE VETERANS ALL KNOW THAT A SIMILAR BILL ALMOST IDENTICAL WAS INTRODUCED IN HEARD AND PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE A YEAR AGO. SO THERE'S BEEN QUITE A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL AND IT'S ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME FORM WE HAVE IT TODAY AND SO I WOULD ARE MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT. THIS IS THAT A PLOT PLENTY OF THAT VETTING AND I THINK IT'S GOOD IT'S. IT'S FOR PREFERS TAKE ACTION ON THIS TODAY AND FINALLY ALL THAT HEARING PROCESS I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF OFF ROAD ENTHUSIASTS IN THE SENATE. I MYSELF. HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN ON ONE OF THOSE BIKES YET BUT I'M VERY OPEN TO THE IDEA JUST SO YOU KNOW. YEAH AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A WORRY THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS GONNA.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES OF THE- MOST RAPIDLY GROWING SEGMENT OF THE VOTER POPULATION TERMS OF REGISTRATION IS NO PARTY PREFERENCEUNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE THE ONLY STATE THAT THAT ACTUALLY PERMITS THIS ON THE CONFUSION EXISTS BECAUSE ONE OF THE PARTIES THAT ONE CAN REGISTER FOR IS CALLED THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY. A GREAT NUMBER OF FOLKS AS WAS ILLUSTRATED IN VARIOUS POLLS WHO REGISTER AS AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY MEMBERS ACTUALLY THINK THE REGISTERING AS INDEPENDENCE OR WHAT IS NOW TERMED AS NO PARTY PREFERENCE THAT IS NOT THE CASE THE CONSEQUENCES OF REGISTERING IS AN AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY MEMBER WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE REGISTERING AS AN ACTUAL INDEPENDENT. ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES YOU CAN'T VOTE SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY FOR PRESIDENT WITH THIS BILL DOES IS SIMPLY SAYS THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE A PARTY THAT HAS THE WORD INDEPENDENT OR DECLINE TO STATE OR NO PARTY PREFERENCE OR VARIATION OF THOSE WORDS IN THE DESIGNATION. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO REGISTER AS INDEPENDENCE THAT THEY REGISTER AS EIGHT AND ARE NO PARTY PREFERENCE PERSON YOU CAN'T CREATE MISLEADING TITLES THAT. ARE FOR EXAMPLE CONNECTED THE DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN PARTY YOU COULDN'T SAY YOU'RE AN AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER OR A REPUBLICAN AMERICAN PARTY MEMBER BECAUSE THAT WOULD DOES IS IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT YOU MAY NOT USE THE WORD INDEPENDENT DECLINE TO STATE OR NO PARTY PREFERENCE IN THE TITLE. OF A- LOCAL PARTY TONIGHT. SURGERY PREPARE ON THE YEAH YEAH VERY MUCH SHOULD JUST pBEFORE US SENATE ROMBERG IT YOU KNOW IN IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES TO THE STUDY. THE STORY WHERE THEY FOUND THAT. 73% OF THE PEOPLE WHO SIGNED UP FOR THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY ON MISTAKENLY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE BEING ON AFFILIATED GOES TO THE POINT. THAT WAS MADE IN THE PRESENTATION ABOUT THE CONFUSION AND THE ONLY POINT I WANT TO ADD IS. YOU DON'T. FISH RIGHT TO VOTE. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AROUND VOTING. TO ENHANCE IT TO MAKE IT EASIER TO GIVE PEOPLE OPTIONS TO PARTICIPATE IN EVERYTHING THAT WE DO. NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MAKING SURE THERE'S NO CONFUSION IN THE PROCESS AND WHEN YOU HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE A PART PART OF A NOTE NO PARTY PREFERENCE WHEN IN FACT THIS PARTY IS THE PARTY THAT NOMINEE IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WAS GEORGE WALLACE. I DON'T MAKE THAT FOR A STATEMENT ABOUT WHETHER ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER I JUST MAKE IT FOR A STATEMENT THAT I SUSPECTED PEOPLE KNEW THAT. AND KNEW WHAT THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF THAT PARTY WAS THAT USED THE WORD INDEPENDENT. THAT THERE WAS CLEAR CONFUSION I WAS SUPPORTED BY THE LOS ANGELES TIMES LAST YEAR I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SENATE BILL SIX NINE SIX AND. I WROTE IT THIS MORNING BEFORE FASHION STARTED. BUT I SEE SB SIX NINE SIX AS A BLATANTLY OPPRESSIVE AND TYRANNICAL MANEUVER. BUT WHAT'S NEW. ABOUT STRONG ARMING IN THIS CHAMBER CALL EXIST LEGISLATURE HAS GONE AFTER ONE POSITIONS WHO ARE TRYING TO PROTECT INFANTS AGAINST VACCINES THEY MAY BE SEVERELY ALLERGIC TO THOSE WHO HUNT BOBCATS THREE SPIRITUAL COUNSELORS WHO ARE PERCEIVED TO BE ADDRESSING THE TOPIC OF CONVERSION THERAPY FOR THE FOR INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA FIVE THE GIG ECONOMY I'LL STOP THERE. IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO GO AFTER. AN ENTIRE POLITICAL PARTY NOW I NOT WE'RE HAVING SUCH A GOOD ROLE THIS YEAR. THIS LEGISLATURE IS BOLD IN ITS BULLYING GO BOULDER GLOBAL GO HOME I GUESS BUT THIS BUT THIS IS CENTER MARK WE'RE GONNA SHOES SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT DO A GREAT JOB. THE DEFINITION OF BALI IS TO SEEK TO HARM INTIMIDATE OR COERCE SOMEONE PERCEIVED AS VULNERABLE. CAN DECIMATE THE A. I. P.'S NAME BECAUSE CAN BUT THE OPTICS MAC THE POLITICAL BULLYING. AND WE MAKE LAWS TO STOP BULLYING. HOW IRONIC. INSTEAD OF ENCOURAGING CITIZENS TO DO A LITTLE RESEARCH TAKE A CIVICS TUTORIAL ANYTHING TO PREVENT THEM FROM EMBARRASSING THEMSELVES SACRAMENTO TAKES AWAY THE POTENTIAL BECAUSE OF SOMEONE'S LOOKING INEPT. THE ART OF WHICH WE'RE ASKING TO SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT ONE OF OUR MISTER PRESIDENT. BY WORKPLACE SOONER JONES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MAKE YOUR POINT ANOTHER POINT IS I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A POINT OF ORDER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHAMBERS I'M NOT SURE THAT THE POINT OF ORDER WAS RECOGNIZED. AND IF THE PERSON MAKING THE POINT OF ORDER WOULD LIKE TO RISE AND GIVE THEIR POINT OF ORDER I THINK THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE CHAMBER. CENTER JACQUI SMITH BELOW IS A POINT OF ORDER THIS IS NOT YOUR MAIN TO THE ESSENCE OF THE BILL WE HAD A DISCUSSION EARLIER THIS MORNING ABOUT FLAME THROWING RESPECTFULLY FROM THE OPPOSITION FROM THE MINORITY LEADER WELLS WELL TAKEN AND IT HAS TO BE APPLIED BY BOTH SIDES I AM OBJECTING IS A POINT OF ORDER THAT THE DISCUSSION NOW IS FLAME THROWING AGAINST THE PARTY IN POWER IT IS NOT ABOUT THE ISSUE IN THE BILL ENTRY. BEFORE US TODAY AND IT'S THAT BASIS UPON WHICH I AM PROJECTION POINT OF ORDER IS WELL TAKEN AND WE'RE STILL GONNA SHOULD REMAIN TO THE SUBJECT OF THE BILL. PRESIDENT I APOLOGIZE FOR THE. DISTURBANCE THAT I'VE CAUSED I DID NOT MEAN TO DO THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE A POINT OF CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY. HAS BEEN AROUND LONGER THAN MANY OF US HAVE BEEN ALIVE. I THINK IT'S A STRANGE TACTIC MISTER PRESIDENT I THINK IT'S A SHAME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM YES. YES. CONSIDER BORDERS I CONCEDE SO YOU MIGHT THINK IT WAS PRESIDENT. I HAVE TO ADMIT. WHEN I LOOK AT PARTY DESIGNATIONS I GET CONFUSED. WHEN I SEE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT ARE THE INDEPENDENT IS IT SOME OTHER ORGANIZATION THE LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE MISLEADING AND WE HAD AN ISSUE NOT THAT LONG AGO ON. HOW DO WE PROTECT THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS WELL STILL PRESERVING OUR- OUR OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OR OR THE INTEGRITY OF THE VOTING PROCESS. IT SEEMS LIKE WE TRIED TO NEARLY TAILOR OUR SOLUTIONS. BUT THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MISSED. WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN. MORE HELPFUL TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR PROCESS BY REQUESTING OR EVEN MANDATING FOR THAT MATTER I DISCLOSURE ON ANY FORMS THAT SAYS THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY IS. A PARTY THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY IDENTIFY ITSELF AS INDEPENDENT OR SOME VARIATION THEREOF THAT INFORMS THE PUBLIC THAT THE TITLE THE READING MAY NOT BE IS AS ACCURATE AS THE LABEL THAT THEY'RE INTERPRETING. SO WHAT I'M WHAT I'M GETTING AT WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT THERE IS A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM BUT THE BILL HERE. I DON'T THINK IT IS IT IS SATISFACTORY SO I GUESS I'M ALL ALLEN HERE THAT THIS IS IT THIS COULD BE THE RIGHT STEP FORWARD BUT IT'S NOT DRAFTED. APPROPRIATELY MY OPINION. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL SCRIPT SENATOR BATES. LOW MILEAGE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. SENATOR BOB HERTZBERG WOULD YOU TAKE THE QUESTION I'M CERTAIN WILL BE THE HIGH POINT OF MY DAY YES. SURVEYS AND MESSY BECAUSE A GOOD SENATOR FROM LAGUNA MIGUEL IS ASKING IT RIGHT. ANYWAY I AM I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY AS A DESIGNATION OF A PARTY EXIST ACROSS THE NATION OR JUST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT JUST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA JUST FROM THE THANK YOU THAT WAS MY QUESTION. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITION DISCUSSIONS DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. NINETEEN NINE CENTER ON BURKE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISS PRESENT AND TO FURTHER RESPOND TO MY GOOD FRIEND THE SENATOR FROM LAGUNA MIGUEL. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY TERMS OF A PARTY DESIGNATION THIS THIS BILL IS ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY IN FACT I THINK IS 20% THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS ACTUALLY VOTED FOR IT. IT IS ENDORSED AND SUPPORTED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY CLERKS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS IN IT GOES TO OUR INTERESTS OUR COLLECTIVE INTERESTS AND IN ENSURING THAT THAT VOTERS AREN'T MISLED. WHEN YOU GO TO THE DMV AND YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE A PARTY AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY STARTS IS THE FIRST PARTY. OF USING YOUR INDEPENDENT. CAN YOU CHECK AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE SEEN AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE SEE IN. ITS GROWTH BEING SO DRAMATIC IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. IF THE PARTY WHICH IS TO BE THE AMERICAN PARTY THEY MAY DO SO. IF THEY WISH TO BE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PARTY WHICH IS SORT OF THEIR DERIVATION OTHER STATES THEY MAY DO SO BUT WHAT THEY CAN'T DO IS THEY CAN'T CONFUSE VOTERS. BY CHOOSING A NAME THAT MANY PEOPLE ASSOCIATE WITH BEING INDEPENDENT WHEN IN FACT THEY ARE NOT. HERE TONIGHT VOTE. THANK YOU AUGUST BAIT INSCRIPTION HAVING SEASON SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

ENSURE THE LEGISLATURE HAS TOOLS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT PROVIDE REASONABLE PATHWAYS FOR INDUSTRY COMPLIANCE WE WORK CLOSELY WITH CTA THE AG COMMUNITY AIR QUALITY OF THE KIDS TO HELP INSURE COMPLIANCE WHILE IMPROVING THE STATE'S AIR QUALITY. I WANT TO THANK BOTH HOUSES FOR ALL OF THEIR HARD WORK OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS TO MAKE SB TWO TEN A BALANCED MAJOR THAN IMPROVES PUBLIC HEALTH AND PROVIDES CLEAN AIR FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SOONER DALLY. THE MEASURE PRESENT MEMBERS I HAVE TO RISE IN OPPOSITION AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE THE HEARING YESTERDAY ON THIS BILL AND AS YOU KNOW I AM IN THE TRUCKING BUSINESS AND WANTED JUST SHARE I KNOW THIS BILL'S GOING TO GET OUT BUT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT IT'S GOING TO HOW IT'S GOING TO IMPACT. THE SMALL OWNER OPERATOR IN INTO IN YUP THE LITTLE GUY AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN REALLY AFFECTED BY AB FIVE IN IN RECENT LEGISLATION AS WELL. THE REASON THAT THE CDA IS OFF IS BECAUSE- THE BILL STATES THAT IF YOU HAVE A BRAND NEW VEHICLE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE. YOUR SMOG CHECK EVERY TWO YEARS YOU GET A FOR YOUR PASS. MOST YOUR LARGE TRUCKING COMPANIES. BIG BUSINESS. LEAST TRUCKS ANY LEESON FOR FOUR YEARS BUT- THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES ON THEM AND THEN THEY TURN AT LEAST IN. AND THEY THEN ARE SOLD TYPICALLY DO GUYS LIKE ME WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY A NEW ONE. EVEN A USED TRUCK CAN BE ROUND WITH THE LAST ONE I PURCHASED WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ADDITIONALLY IF YOUR CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO GET THAT THAT YOU HAVE SEVENTY FIVE DAYS FOR ACT TO GO GET IT CHECKED BUT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT THERE ARE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SENSORS. ON THESE TRUCKS. NOW ON THE MOST RECENT TRUCK THAT I. HAVE PURCHASED. I'VE HAD IT TO THE SHOP SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE I'VE HAD A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON. IN THE TRUCK SEEM TO BE PERFORMING WELL. BUT IT'S THE SENSOR ITSELF THAT GOES OUT. FROM SIX HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS IS THE BILL EVERY TIME I HAVE TO GO IN AND HAVE THAT CHECKED OUT. NOW THE TRUCK I USED TO OWN THE OLDER TRUCKS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO WORK ON OURSELVES AND RUN FOR YEARS WITHOUT TAKING THEM TO THE DEALERS. DID NOT HAVE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS WE HAVE TODAY OBVIOUSLY. BUT THE TECHNOLOGY NOW IT'S CHANGED. BECAUSE THAT TECHNOLOGIES CHANGED WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON OUR- VEHICLES AS YOU DON'T YOUR OWN CARS. AND SO THE DEALERS ARE ALL FOR THIS BECAUSE WHAT DOES IT DO IT IT REQUIRES YOU TO GO IN AND MANY OF YOU PROBABLY HAVE NOTICED THAT. IF YOU HAVE A CAR THAT HOUSE THE SENSORS THAT TELL YOU HOW MUCH AIR IS IN THE IN THE TIRES IT COMES ON YOUR- DASH AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT INTO THE TIRE SHOP. AND MANY TIMES IT MAY BE JUST A COLD MORNING BECAUSE IT CAN DEBTS ARE A HOT DAY WHERE YOU'RE TRAVELING OR THE SENSOR GOES OUT. THEY'RE REQUIRED BY LAW TO NOT LEAVE THAT THAT VEHICLE LEAVE WITHOUT THOSE CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS ALL. WHICH DRIVES ACOSTA FOR EVERYBODY EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST SIMPLY A SENSOR THERE'S NOTHING WRONG SAFETY WISE YOU CAN TAKE A GAUGE AND CHECK YOUR TIRE AND MANY TIMES ON THE TRUCKS. THE SENSOR IS THE PROBLEM ITSELF IT'S NOT THE PROBLEM WITH THE TRUCK SO THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT. SMALL OPERATORS MORE THAN IT IS THE BIG OPERATORS AND IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS THE- PROMOTE MORE CELLS OF TRUCKS AND THAT'S WHY THE DEALERS AND THOSE GUYS ARE HAPPY ABOUT IT BUT THEY IT'S GOING TO DRIVE THE COST UP OF TRANSPORTATION COSTS IN CALIFORNIA. UP IN THERE IS IN A MINUTE IN THE BILL TO THE WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD PART OF THE BILL WHICH I WILL SAY IS THAT IT REQUIRES pWITH CALIFORNIA LAW WHICH WILL HELP US BE A LITTLE MORE COMPARED BUT THE END OF THE DAY. THE SMALL GUYS GOING TO GET HURT AND IT'S GOING TO DRIVE THE COST UP OF LIVING IN PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THIS PIECE ELECTION SO I URGE. NO VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY S. SENATOR GIRL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT A QUESTION THE AUTHOR YES TURNER WHICH TO QUESTION ABSOLUTELY I REALIZE THAT THERE IS AN EXEMPTION IN THE BILL ARE AT THERE IS A AN INCLUSION IN THE BILL FOR OUT OF STATE TRUCKERS AN OUT OF STATE VEHICLES THAT COME FROM ACROSS STATE LINES IS THERE A ALSO AN INCLUSION FOR OUT OF COUNTRY VEHICLES. DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN OPERATION YOU HAVE TO HELP GO THROUGH A SMOG CHECK. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AN OPERATING PERMIT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT WOULD PLAY APPLY TO ANY TRUCK FROM ANYWHERE BEING DRIVEN IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA SO IF YOU CAN'T YOUR FOR TRUCK. WHETHER FROM OUT OF COUNTRY WHETHER IT'S FROM OUT OF STATE. CANNOT PASS A SMOG CHECK YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REGISTER IN CALIFORNIA AND OBTAIN AN- OPERATOR'S PERMIT. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT ON MY OWN TIME. WE PASS LEGISLATION IN THIS BUILDING OVER THE FAST PAST TEN YEARS AND IT IT DEALS WITH THEM YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S FREEDOM LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THE BALCONY AND ALSO PEOPLE'S FREEDOM TO OPERATE A BUSINESS ENTERING AND DO WHEN YOU. WHEN YOU OPERATE A BUSINESS AND YOU HAVE LEGISLATION THAT COMES THROUGH JUST LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA SAID FROM BEAVER. WE GO FROM CULTURAL LOW CARBON FUELS WE GO FROM LOW CARBON FEELS ULTRA LOW COVERED FEELS TO ALTER ALTER TO NON EXISTENT TO NOW EMISSIONS AND THE TURNOVER RATES FOR THESE THESE THE EXPENSE AND THE TURNOVER RATES FOR THESE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT FOR BUSINESS TO OPERATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS COMPLETELY OVERWHELMING. AND SO HAVING THAT IN MIND AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT BUSINESSES ARE NOW STRUGGLING WITH MAKING SURE THAT THEY COMPLY WITH THE CURRENT RULES UNDER THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY'VE ALREADY BOUGHT IT IS NOT YET OUT OF COMPLIANCE. I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. CENTER HER TITLE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT YOU KNOW I WANT TO START OFF BY. SPEAKING A LITTLE BIT OF TRUTH AND I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO KNOWS THIS VERY WALL THAT I'VE BEEN A LITTLE BIT RELUCTANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL. BECAUSE THE DISTRICT HAS YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE JUST THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ADDITIONAL. REGULATION AND ONE NOT RIGHT BUT- I ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR MY DISTRICT MOBILE SOURCE POLLUTION IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO AIR. IN THE SOUTHERN CENTRAL VALLEY. AND IT'S A TOUGH VOTE FOR ME BUT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I AM PLEASED TO SEE THE AMENDMENTS. THAT WORD THAT ADDRESS MANY OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS. AND THIS BILL I THINK STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE AND RECOGNIZES THE CENTRAL ROLE THAT HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS PLAY IN MY DISTRICT WHILE ALSO REDUCING EMISSIONS. OF HARMFUL POLLUTANTS FROM MOBILE SOURCES. AND WITHOUT COLLEAGUES I URGE YOU TO VOTE I. ON SB TWO SIXTY. Q. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENA MORE MICROPHONES SENATOR LABOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND THANK YOU TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAYING I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS IT MAY BE A TOUGH BLOW FOR HER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY MEMBERS IF THIS IS OUR THIRD YEAR WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS WITH EVERYONE INVOLVED WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED. AND YOU KNOW WHAT A GOOD NEGOTIATION IS A GOOD NEGOTIATIONS WHEN EVERYBODY WALKS AWAY A LITTLE BIT HAPPY A LITTLE BIT UNHAPPY AND THAT'S THE BALANCE THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED HERE. ALL THESE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT SO WAS OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND THAT'S WHY WE TOOK EVERY SINGLE AMENDMENT THAT AG ASKED US TO TAKE. EXCEPT FOR ONE AND THAT WILL GO TO THE H. Q. EMPTY FOR MOBILE SOURCING TO MAKE SURE AND THEY HAVE COMMITTED THE RB HAS COME A QB HAS COMMITTED. TO DOING MBILE SOURCE TESTING SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE A HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED MILES. TO GET YOUR VEHICLETESTED. I THINK THIS IS A BILL THAT DOES WHAT WE ALL WANT TO DO HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT WHAT WE ALL WANT TO DO HERE ON THIS FLOOR. THAT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT BUSINESSES CAN STILL OPERATE. AND BE PROFITABLE BUT WE ALSO STILL HAVE CLEAN AIR TO BREATHE YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL. IN THE SEVENTIES AND YOU COULDN'T SEE THE MOUNTAINS. AND THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER THE SKIES ARE BLUE OR BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE PARTICULATES ARE SMALLER. AND WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THIS BILL OVER TEN YEARS WILL BE THE EQUIVALENT OF TAKING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND. IG DIESEL TRUCKS THE WORKS POLLUTERS. OFF OF THE STREET.

WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER GROW ON THE SIDE OF. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR MAJORITY TO QUESTION OF COURSE. THANK YOU HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR FUNDING FROM THE STRESS TO ACTUALLY GET IN THE HANDS OF HOMEOWNERS TO HELP THEM. WELL I DON'T KNOW OFFHAND. IF YOU NEEDED BEFORE WE TAKE A VOTE I'D BE HAPPY TO CHECK WITH STAFF AND FIND OUT. THAT BE GREAT. MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S GOING TO GO INTO A TRUST IS GOING TO BE GOVERNED BY THERE'D BE INTO THE STOCK MARKET OF THE STOCK MARKET CRASHES. AND SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THIS FUNDING STREAM WE ARE WE GET PREPARED TO HAVE THE GENERAL FUND REPLACES THREE IN A THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ORIGINALLY STOLEN. FROM THE TAXPAYERS. CENTER CENTER METERS CHECKING ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION SO SHE'S LIKE FRANKIE MISTER PRESIDENT. WE HAVE EVERYONE ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY COLLEAGUE REFERENCED TO TAXPAYER DOLLARS BEING STOLEN THERE WAS A COURT ORDER THAT DECLARED THE LEGISLATURE NEEDED TO SET UP THE TRUST THAT'S WHAT THE TRAILER BILL DOES TO ESTABLISH THE TRUST IN JANUARY HOPEFULLY THROUGH ANOTHER BUDGET ACTION SO WOULD TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE TO BE INTRODUCED ON THAT THEN WOULD ALLOW THE DISBURSEMENT OF THE OF THE FUNDS SO THIS TRAILER BILL. ESTABLISHES THE. PRESS FUN ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. TO ACTUALLY DISPERSE THE FUNDS. AT SO I CAN'T ANSWER YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE BUT THAT'S THE TIME FRAME THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME. I THINK THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PRESENTED IS INCORRECT THE ORDER DOES NOT REQUIRE THE LEGISLATURE TO ESTABLISH A TRUST THE ORDER REQUIRES THE THREE NINE THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE RETURNED TO THE HOMEOWNERS. AND SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THIS RETURN OF THESE FUNDS WERE STRUCK FOR STRUGGLING HOMEOWNERS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN WE'VE HEARD STORIES OF HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE STILL WAITING DESPERATELY FOR THESE FUNDS THAT WERE PROMISED IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN BUDGETS MONEY WAS TAKEN FROM THESE HOLDOVERS AND PUT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BUDGET BUT THE MAJORITY PARTY. THIS GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THEN WENT TO OUR THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL TO FILE A LAWSUIT THIS IS BACKGROUND ON THIS AND SHE REFUSED TO FOLLOW LAWSUIT OR WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO RETURN THESE THREE OR THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. SO WE STOOD BESIDE WE AS REPUBLICANS THE NATIONAL ASIAN COALITION AMERICAN COALITION AND THE NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION IN THEIR ADMIRABLE FIGHT TO GET THESE FRIENDS RETURNED THE RECENTLY MORE GOT A COURT JUDGMENT FROM THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT THIS IS THIS THREE NINE THIRTY WIN ONE MILLION DOLLARS WAS TENDED ONLY TO HELP HOMEOWNERS HOMEOWNERS AND SHOULD BE RETURNED. FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF DURING MORTGAGE AND FORECLOSURE CRISIS THIS BILL RIGHT HERE THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY WILL INVEST THESE FUNDS AN UNKNOWN WAYS AND NOT RETURN THIS MONEY TO THE HOMEOWNERS. THIS GOVERNMENT DID NOT EVEN TAKE UP THE FIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO RETURN THIS THREE NINE THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE PEOPLE OR THE HOMEOWNERS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO NON PROFITS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN NONPROFIT INDONESIAN NONPROFIT LED BY A VERY STRONG WOMAN ADVOCATED AND FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THIS. STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO GET THIS MONEY BACK AND THEY HAVE WRITTEN OPPOSE LETTER TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION TODAY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT RETURN THE MONEY TO THE HOMEOWNERS IT PUTS THE PLAN IN A TRUST AND ESTABLISHES ANOTHER GOVERNMENT. BUREAUCRATIC AGENCY. I DIDN'T. MOTOR FANS AD THIS VOTE RIGHT HERE TODAY IS JUST ANOTHER DELAY FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THE HOMEOWNERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY AND I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DEBATE SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB ONE ONE THREE AS WE KNOW THE STATE'S REAM COURT RULED THAT THE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE NATION'S LARGEST MORTGAGE BANKS TO HOW CALIFORNIA'S HOMEOWNERS VICTIMIZED BY ILLEGAL LENDING PRACTICES DURING THE MORTGAGE MORTGAGE CRISIS WAS UNLAWFULLY TAKEN BY GOVERNOR BROWN AND HIS FINANCIAL OFFICERS AND DIVERTED TO THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND. THIS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS WAS INTENDED TO ONLY HELP HOMEOWNERS WHO WERE ABUSED BY LENDERS DURING THE MORTGAGE AND FORECLOSURE CRISIS AND NOW WE ARE BEING ASKED TO USE IT FOR A MYRIAD OF OTHER PURPOSES AS SET FORTH IN THE LEGISLATION BETTER AGAIN QUESTIONABLE GIVEN THE EXPLICIT RULINGS BY THE COURTS THIS MANY SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO A PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY VALUABLE CALLED KEEP YOUR HOME CALIFORNIA. THE FREE MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT HAS HELPED MORE THAN EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOMEOWNERS WHO FACE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP IN WORRIED ABOUT LOSING THEIR HOME THE GOVERNOR SENIOR HOUSING ADVISER WHEN SHE WAS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY STATED AND I QUOTE. KEEP YOUR HOME CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A VERY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM HELPING HOMEOWNERS DEAL WITH THEIR FINANCIAL CHALLENGES AND AVOID. FORECLOSURE AS THEY GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. END QUOTE. SKEWS ME THIS STATE MANAGE PROGRAM ALLOWS HOMEOWNERS TO AVOID FORECLOSURE BY PROVIDING AS MUCH AS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ASSISTANCE KEEP YOUR HOME CALIFORNIA PROVIDES A SECOND CHANCE TO STRUGGLING HOMEOWNERS. THE KEEP YOUR HOME CALIFORNIA PROGRAM IS PRESENTLY CLOSED BECAUSE ALL OF THE FUNDS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PREVENT FORECLOSURES THAT WAS OVER ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED TO APPROVED HOMEOWNERS ARE COMMITTED TO QUALIFY TO HOMEOWNERS THIS TYPE OF EFFORT THAT THE MARGIN MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO FUND. IT ALREADY EXISTS EVERY PENNY OF THIS SETTLEMENT MONEY SHOULD GO TO REINSTATE THE KEEP YOUR HOME CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. AB ONE THIRTEEN DOES NOT HELP THIS WERE THE PROGRAM IN MOST OF THOSE AFFECTED BY IN THE SHORT TERM BY THE MORTGAGE CRISIS I RECOMMEND A NO VOTE THANK YOU MISTER CRADDICK SOONER VERY TO SB ONE THIRTEEN. SB ONE THIRTEEN OZ SENATOR Y. KASKI. PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE SB ONE THIRTEEN LET'S BE CLEAR IF WE VOTE NO ON SB ONE THIRTEEN NOBODY GETS ANY MONEY. THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS NOTHING HAPPENS IT'S FINE TO CRITICIZE THE SLOW MOTION OF STATE GOVERNMENT. THAT'S THAT'S FINE BUT THIS IS GOING TO TRANSFER THE MONEY INTO THE NATIONAL. MORTGAGE SPECIAL DEPOSIT FINE AND WILL PROCEED IN A TIMELY MANNER AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE IS SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY PENNY OF THIS MONEY GOES TO THE PEOPLE A WRIST. WHO ARE ENTITLED TO A REGION I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. MR LEADING CHEN THE SENATE I WOULD. URGE A NO VOTE AGAIN. TO ME IS THIS IS A TRIFLING WITH OUR PROCESS A COMPLICATED NEW SYSTEM. THAT IS AND WILL BE RISKY. AND GOING TO BE DIRECTED FUNDS IF. THAT WOULD PASSED INPUT INTO LAW SOME OF THESE FUNDS WILL BE DIRECTED TO AREAS THAT MIGHT FACILITATE A CERTAIN SECTOR. THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOULD CURSE OF HOUSING BUT IT IS NOT WHAT WE'VE LOOKED AT HISTORICALLY AS PROVIDING HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. IT UNTIL I THINK AND I ARGUE THAT IT'S OF CORRUPTION OF THE PROCESS AND MANIPULATION OF THE PROCESS. AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD VOTE NO. THANKS CENTER NIELSEN CENTER JONES. I THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I HAVE A LETTER THAT THE MINORITY LEADER RECEIVED RECENTLY MANY OF THE POINTS OF ALL OF THE POINTS IN THE LETTER ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN DEBATED THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND THE HEARING PROCESS I DID WANT TO QUOTE JUST A SHORT PART OF IT IF I COULD MISTER PRESENT HAVE PERMISSION TO READ. ARE YOU ARE YOU ASKING FOR PERJURY. YES SIR PRODUCT THANK YOU. AND I DID GET A COMMITMENT. FROM THE REPUBLICAN LEADER THAT SHE WILL DISPERSE THIS LETTER TO THE OTHER MEMBERS IF THE SUIT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT. BUT IT'S FROM THE NATIONAL ASIAN AMERICAN COALITION. THERE SEE IS A FAITH BUT PRESIDENCY IS FAITH PARTIES TO. AND THE OPENING PARAGRAPH THE NATIONAL ASIAN AMERICAN COALITION AND THE NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION. REITERATE ITS FERVENT CALL FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN REGARDS OF THE RETURN OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. TO THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SPECIAL DEPOSIT FUND IN M. S. D. F. THAT IS TO UTILIZE AND DISPERSE THE FUN IN A MANNER THAT WILL NOT DELAY THE ORIGINAL INTENT. OF DELIVERING AID AND ASSISTANCE TO HOMEOWNERS IN DISTRESS. THERE'S A- FIVE THERE'S SIX POINTS THAT THEY MAKE THAT UP THAT ALL BEEN BROUGHT UP. BUT I'LL CLOSE WITH JUST BY READING THE LAST POINT NUMBER SIX. HOMEOWNERS HAVE ALREADY WAITED TOO LONG FOR THESE SETTLEMENT FUNDS TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. THIS I NEEDED INVESTMENT SCHEME APPEARS TO DELAY IMMEDIATE ACTION AND RESULTS. INSTEAD OF THIS BILL THE STATE SHOULD SIMPLY USE THE FUNDS TO DIRECTLY ASSIST HOMEOWNERS THIS YEAR. MISTER PRESIDENT I ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON SB ONE THIRTEEN. THANK YOU CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THIS IS A CLASSIC GOVERNMENTAL BAIT AND SWITCH THE STATE SHOULD NOT TAKE MONEY THAT WAS LEGALLY OBTAINED FOR ONE PURPOSE AND THEN USING IT FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE. YOU KNOW. WE HAVE A TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT WAS AN ORDER THE SAID THAT THIS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE USED TO HELP THOSE THAT WERE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF DURING THE MORTGAGE CRISIS WOULD GET THAT MONEY AND BE ABLE TO. HOPEFULLY REBOUND TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. LOOK AT OUR HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOOK AT OUR POVERTY OVER EIGHTEEN PERCENT. WE SHOULD BE FAST TRACKING THIS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND NOT PUTTING IT INTO A SPECIAL TRUST. BECAUSE BASICALLY BY PUTTING IN THIS TRUST YOU'RE LOOKING AT CREATING AN ENDOWMENT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE SUPPLEMENT SAID WE'RE NOT CREATING AN ENDOWMENT. TO USE INTEREST ON MONEY TO HELP A FINITE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND I WILL SAY A SMALL FINITE OF PEOPLE. RATHER THAN A MUCH LARGER GROUP OF PEOPLE THE NEED TO HELP TODAY NOT TEN YEARS FROM NOW ARE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE WAITED SEVEN YEARS. TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THE ABUSES THAT THEY SUFFERED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IF THE DEMOCRATS IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT ARE HOLDING THIS MONEY UP. FOR THAT REASON LET'S STAND FOR THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY THOSE THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF DURING THE MORTGAGE CRISIS. LET'S GET TO THE MONEY TO THE RIFLE PEOPLE SO THEY CAN MAYBE BUY A HOME OR RENT A HOME AND GET THEIR CELLS OFF THE STREETS. I STAND UP FOR THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE CALIFORNIA WERE HEARD IN THE MORTGAGE CRISIS. I HOPE YOU WILL TOO BY SUPPORTING US BE ONE ONE THREE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION FOR BAIT ON THIS ITEM.

SENATOR GLAZER WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ ITEM FIFTY. ASSEMBLY BILL FORTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL ANAK REALLY TO EDUCATION FINANCE. GLAZER THIS PRESIDENTE AND MEMBERS AT FIRST AS A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE TO ME THANK EVERYONE FOR GETTING US ORGANIZED AGAIN TO COMPLETE OUR BUSINESS TODAY AND- ANSWER THE BECAUSE OF THE BILL THAT I'M GOING TO PRESENT TO YOU. PRESENT TO YOU NOW. ASSEMBLY BILL FORTY EIGHT PLACES A FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR K. THROUGH TWELVE THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION BOND. ON THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY DOLLARS. THE BOND INCLUDES NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOR PRESCHOOL THROUGH GRADE TWELVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IN TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL REFLECT CHANGES REQUESTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. IN CONSULTATION WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND SENATE AND ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP. THE BILL MAKES CHANGES TO THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING. INCREASING THE STATE MATCH FOR LOW WELL DISTRICTS AND DISTRICTS WITH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF LOW INCOME FOSTER CARE. AN E. L. STUDENTS. BY PRIORITIZING THE REVIEW OF CERTAIN APPLICATIONS INCLUDING HEALTH AND SAFETY. APPLICATIONS THAT REMEDIATE LEAD IN DRINKING WATER THAT PROVIDE. A PRIORITY FOR LOWER WELL DISTRICTS AND FOR OVERCROWDED SCHOOLS. BY ALLOWING STATE BOND FUNDS TO BE USED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF PRESCHOOL CLASSROOMS KITCHENS IN SPACE FOR COUNSELORS AND NURSES. BY ADJUSTING THE CAP ON LOCAL BONDING TO AUGMENT SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS ABILITY TO RAISE LOCAL FUNDS. AND ALSO UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SIX THE BILL WAY SCHOOL IMPACT FEES FOR MULTI HOUSING PROJECTS LOCATED WITHIN ONE A HALF A MILE OF A TRANSIT STOP. AND REDUCES SCHOOL IMPACT FEES BY 20% FOR OTHER MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROJECTS. AND FINALLY HERE THE BILL ALSO SPENDS LEVEL THREE FEES UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. NOW AB FORTY EIGHT ALSO PROVIDES FUNDS FOR THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMSSMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT ASSISTANCE TESTING REMEDIATION OF LETTING WATER. DISASTER ASSISTANCE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION SIDE THE BILL PRIORITIZES FUNDING FOR UC AND CSU PROJECTS. THAT ADDRESS FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY SEISMIC AND CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES. AND REQUIRES UC AND CSU TO ADOPT FIVE YEAR AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING PLANS. MEMBERS THE NEED IS GREAT. IN FACT MUCH GREATER THAN WHAT IS PROVIDED IN THIS BILL. BUT THIS BOND IS IN IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD FOR ALL OF OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND THERE'S AN AYE VOTE. ANY DESCRIPTION OF IT ON THE ITEM SENATOR MORLOCK. RISK PRESIDENT. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. FORTY EIGHT COLLEAGUES I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS AND I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS. SO START WITH THE BAD NEWS. CALIFORNIA'S UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT GREW BY FORTY THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. AND THE LAST YEAR. THE UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT FOR JUNE THIRTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE POINT FIVE BILLION. FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE THIRTY TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT'S NOW TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. THE MAJOR REASON FOR THE INCREASE COLLEAGUES WAS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD THAT REQUIRES FINALLY THAT UNFUNDED ACTUARIAL ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR RETIREE MEDICAL PLANS BE INCLUDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. SO IN THIS LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA'S BALANCE SHEET IS MORE MISERABLE BY ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE WERE THREE STATES THAT THERE ON RESTRICTED THAT DEFICITS GROUP MUCH MORE THAN OURS. ILLINOIS GREW BY FORTY EIGHT POINT SEVEN BILLION. NEW JERSEY BY SIXTY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION. AND TAXES BY SEVENTY NINE POINT FIVE BILLION. TRADITIONALLY EVERY YEAR CALIFORNIA'S HAD THE LARGEST UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT ALWAYS PLACING AND FIFTY OF PLACE BUT THIS YEAR THERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS. BECAUSE NEW JERSEY HAD SUCH A LARGE INCREASE IT IS NOW AT TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IT JUST EDGED OUT CALIFORNIA WITH THE LARGEST ON FUNDED. ARE SHOULD BE UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT BE THIS OUT BY KNOWS THE WORD IN FORTY NINTH PLACE WHICH IS PROBABLY WHERE WE SHOULD BE BEING A FORTY NINER FROM LONG BEACH STATE KINDA COOL BUT TEXAS A GROUP TO A HUNDRED AND FOUR POINT SIX BILLION. SO IF YOU COMBINE THOSE FOUR STATES THEIR UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICITS TOTAL OF THREE QUARTERS OF A TRILLION DOLLARS. COLLEAGUES CALIFORNIA DOESN'T NEED MORE DEBT. AND IF IT IS PAID OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND AS OPPOSED TO PROP NINETY EIGHT THE INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS WILL CROWD OUT OTHER CRITICAL PROGRAM FUNDING LOOKING AT FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IN INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS COLLEAGUES WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE AN INVERTED YIELD CURVE ARRIVE AGAIN I'VE DEALT WITH THIS IN TIMES PAST THAN IT DID PORTENDS A RECESSION IS ON THE HORIZON HORIZON ADDING IT SO ADDING MORE BOND PAYMENTS WHICH ARE FIXED COSTS TO OUR BUDGET WILL BE VERY IMPRUDENT AT THIS TIME. CONSEQUENTLY REGARDLESS OF HOW GOOD THE CAUSES FOR BORROWING WITH TOO MUCH DEBT OF ALL POLL TAX SYSTEM GROWING PENSION CONTRIBUTION COSTS AND A POTENTIAL RECESSIONON THE HORIZON I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE IN ADVICE AT THIS LEGISLATURE FOCUS ON PAYING CASH FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND SETTING FUNDS ASIDE NOW FOR ITS FUTURE MAINTENANCE JUST LIKE WE REQUIRE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS TO DO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND I URGE A NO VOTE ON A. B. FORTY EIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING AS NIMBLE AS YOU YOU HAVE BEEN IN MAKING THIS THIS NEW VENUE WORK OUT FOR ALL OF US. A I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY. NOW HOWEVER THERE ARE CERTAIN NEEDS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL IN OUR STATE. THAT AT THIS POINT CANNOT BE SATISFIED BY A GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE. WE HAVE IN UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WE HAVE TWO BILLION THEY'LL BE GOING TO COMMUNICATE ALL AGES TWO BILLION TO UC'S IN TWO BILLION TO SEE ISSUES ON TOP OF THE NINE THAT WOULD BE GOING TO THE K. THROUGH TWELVE. I HAVE SOME SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE POISON PILLS. BETTER THAT ARE IN THIS. AND THE QUESTION THAT I'VE HAD TO ASK MYSELF IS THE NEEDS SO GREAT THAT WE MUST. MOVE THIS FORWARD AND MOVING THIS FORWARD IS NOT A LEGISLATIVE ACT IN TERMINUS IT IS GIVING THE VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DECISION ON THIS ISSUE. AND I BELIEVE IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY HAS REPRESENT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY ONE OF OTHERS ONE OF MANY OTHERS IS TO GIVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA. I'M A BIG CHAMPION OF UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA C. ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNICATORS OCCASION SYSTEMS. AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE. ARE MUCH GREATER THAN OUR GENERAL FUND COULD EVER MUSTER IN ANY GIVEN YEAR OR EVEN THREE OR FOUR FIVE YEARS SO OUT OF NECESSITY THIS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE IS JUST SIMPLY NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. I AM GOING TO BE CASTING AN AYE VOTE I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME. MAYBE NOT BECAUSE THEY AGREE WITH ALL OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BUT GIVING CALIFORNIANS THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE TO VOTE ON THIS AND THE DETERMINATION TO REACH THEIR OWN CONCLUSION I THINK IS ESSENTIAL AND THAT IS WHILE BE CASTING AN AYE VOTE IN FAVOR ARE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. THANK YOU. CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU OF. MISTER PRESIDENT. IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. WE HAVE AUTHORIZED FORTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN FACILITIES BONDS FOR K. THROUGH FOURTEEN U. K. THROUGH TWELVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE ISSUES AND THE UC SYSTEM MAKE IT SIXTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF FACILITIES. INDEED THERE WILL BE SOME DEBT BURDEN AND I THINK WHAT WAS INDICATED BY TO HEAR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IS PROBABLY PRETTY ACCURATE. AND WE NOW HAVE EIGHTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. BUT IS EVERY MEMBER IN THIS SENATE. AND I THINK MOST MEMBERS A CALIFORNIA UNDERSTAND THAT EDUCATION IS THE CORE OF UPWARD MOBILITY. TO THE MATTER IS THAT ARE YOU PEOPLE FOOT SPENDING IN K. TO TWELVE IS WAY BELOW WHAT IT SHOULD BE. THE NOTION OF MODERNIZING FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN IS SOMETHING THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND THEN IF YOU'RE GONNA PUT A SMALL BURDEN OF DEBT WHAT BETTER PLACE TO DO THAT THEN FOR EDUCATION FOR UPWARD MOBILITY FOR PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES WHEN YOU LOOK AT EVERY ECONOMIST LEFT TO RIGHT WHEREVER HEY ARE ON THIS POLITICAL SPECTRUM IT IS ALL ABOUT EDUCATION IS THE CORE WE TALK ABOUT IT. IN THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY WITH MODERNIZING THESE FACILITIES WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND THINGS THAT WE NEVER DREAMED OF BEFORE. IS JUST EXTRAORDINARY SO THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS AND I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS AUTHORS IN BOTH HOUSES FOR THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN. DOWN ON THE SENATE THIS UNFORTUNATE DAY. FOR THE STATE SENATE A HISTORIC DAY IT IS ALSO IN THIS RESPECT WITH THIS BILL A FORTUNATE DAY. THE FORTUNATE DAY WHERE WE CAN STAND UP FOR THE A PRIORITY I THINK THAT GENERALLY ALL CALIFORNIANS HOLD. FOR THE PUBLIC DOLLARS IN THE STATE PUBLIC SAFETY AND EDUCATION. I BELIEVE IS TO REMAIN AT THE VERY TOP. I SPENT MANY MANY YEARS SERVING ON THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD I GOT TO LEARN VERY UP FRONT AND VERY PERSONALLY THE PLIGHT OF SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION DEFERRED MAINTENANCE REHABILITATION. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THROUGH TRYING TIMES THEN. AND EVEN NOW. MANY OF THOSE FACILITIES HAVE. DECLINED EVEN MORE NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO BE. REHABILITATED. OR HAVE MAINTENANCE BEING DEFERRED THAT'S A HISTORIC PROBLEM. AND THOUGH WE HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN SOME SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA THOSE ARE GENERALLY SCHOOLS THAT ALL HAVE HUGE. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE CHALLENGE AND WE WILL HAVE A GROWING ENROLLMENT. THROUGHOUT HIGHER EDUCATION. HISTORICALLY THEIR CAPITAL OUTLAY ISSUES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ETCETERA HAVE BEEN FUNDED THROUGH THE STATE WIDE BONDS. LOCAL DISTRICTS A REGION'S DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY. TO COME UP WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS REQUIRED. FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION. THAT HIGHER EDUCATION. AND THE PREVIOUS BOND THAT HAD BEEN PASSED. BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL PLIGHT OF THE STATE. PRIOR ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE TIGHT. AND GETTING MONEY OUT. THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH A LONG TROUGH. WITHOUT HAVING ANOTHER BONTA FOR US. AND WITHOUT HAVING SUFFICIENT MONEY TO KEEP UP. ALLOCATED BY THAT BOARD. NOW IS MORE TIME IN A TIMELY THAN EVER. BECAUSE THE NEED IS GREATER. WE ALL ARE SENSITIVE TO THE BONDED INDEBTEDNESS OF CALIFORNIA BUT THAT IS NOT A PRODUCT I ARGUE UP K. TWELVE EDUCATION OR HIGHER EDUCATION CONSTRUCTION ETCETERA BONDS. IT IS A PLETHORA OF BONDS THAT WE HAVE LACKED FOR MANY MANY OTHER PURPOSES. FAR LESS IMPORTANT IN EDUCATION. THEN I SAY IN THESE TIMES WE HAVE GOT TO HARKEN. TO THE HIGHEST OF PRIORITIES. AND THIS MOST ASSUREDLY SHOULD REMAIN OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. WE CANNOT SACRIFICE THOSE INSTITUTIONAL FACILITIES NEEDS FOR OTHER OTHER FIVE OR TEN YEARS WHICH IS WHAT WE WILL INDOOR IF WE DO NOT. PASS THIS MEASURE. AND THEN ENCOURAGE OUR CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF OUR YOUTH. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND EVEN OUR ADULTS. ONE LAST THING I AM PLEASED THAT IN THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE BEEN PUT BACK TO THE PERRY PURSUE STATUS THEY WERE A BEHIND. CSU AND YOU SEE. THEY NEEDED A LITTLE BIT MORE RESOURCES THERE VITAL PART AND THE MASTER PLAN THAT WE REVIEWED IN THE EIGHTIES SET THEM EQUAL THE CSU AND YOU SEE FULL PARTNERS IN THE TRIPARTITE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA FULL PARTNERS THAT BEING THE CASE I'M GLAD NOW THEY ARE FULL PARTNERS IN SHARING SOME OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE BOND. I REGION I VOTE. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING SEEN ON SENATOR GLAZER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THIS FOR PRESIDENT MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU TO THE SENATORS WHO SPOKE APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS. PARTICULAR APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT FROM THE US SENATOR FROM FRESNO THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND TO HANNAH. AND IT GIVES YOU A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPROMISE AND CONSENSUS BUILDING THAT WENT INTO THIS MEASURE IT ENJOYS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE GREAT LEADERSHIP OF OUR GOVERNOR OF OUR PRESIDENT PRO TEM SPEAKER THE ASSEMBLY AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THESE DISCUSSIONS TO BRING THIS MEASURE BEFORE YOU. AND CERTAINLY I'D BE REMISS WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE GOOD WORK OF THE EDUCATION CHAIR IN THE ASSEMBLY THE JOINT AUTHORED WITH ME ASSEMBLY MEMBER DONALD. AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH THIS MEASURE THE VOTERS ARE GOING TO MAKE THE FINAL DECISION. BUT WE ALL KNOW AS IT HAS SO ARTICULATELY BEEN EXPRESSED TONIGHT THE EDUCATION OF OUR YOUTH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DO IT IS A PRIORITY. I HOPE THAT YOU AGREE I HELP THE VOTERS AGREE THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EITHER IN AB FORTY EIGHT. THANK YOU. MISTER SENATOR GLAZER MISMAS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. RIGHT. GEN.

ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ AN ACT RELATING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SENATOR DORADO THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT UP MEMBERS AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN. WHAT BETTER PREVENT MISUSE OF STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT DATABASES SPECIFICALLY THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT HELICAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM CLASS CLASS IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK AVAILABLE TO ALL PUBLIC AGENCIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHIN THE STATE IT PROVIDES ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES WITH THE CAPABILITY OF OBTAINING INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM STATE AND FEDERAL OF FEDERAL AND STATE COMPUTERIZED INFORMATION FILES. RECENT REPORTS OF UNCOVERED THAT SOME FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ACCESSING STATE RUN DATABASES CONCERNING INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WITH LICENSES THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER AB SIXTY THIS IS A BREACH OF PUBLIC TRUST AND WE MUST IMPLEMENT GUIDELINES TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THIS BILL REQUIRES JUSTIFICATION FOR INQUIRIES SEEKING INFORMATION OTHER THAN CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION. AVAILABLE THROUGH CLOUDS THIS BILL ALSO AUTHORIZES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO CONDUCT AUDITS INVESTIGATIONS TO MONITOR SUBSCRIBER COMPLIANCE OF CLOUDS THIS BILL IS NEEDED TO PREVENT STATE RESOURCES FROM BEING USED FOR FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PROPER MEASURES ARE IN PLACE TO JUSTIFY INQUIRIES IN CLUBS AND ALLOW FOR AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS TO TAKE PLACE THAT WOULD IDENTIFY MISUSE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY DISCUSSION DEBATE CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB IN YOUR ADAPTATION TODAY IN OUR STAFF THANK YOU. I RISE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN WILL PROHIBIT CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM SHARING DATABASES WITH FORMER FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED SB FIFTY FOUR THE PLACE GUIDELINES ON THE SHARING OF INFORMATION TO ALLOW. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO CONTINUE SHARING INFORMATION REGARDING CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY THREATS AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WILL ALSO LIMITING THE USE OF INFORMATION SOLELY FOR IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES SB FIFTY FOUR WAS HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL AND TOOK MANY MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS TO GET VARIOUS PEACE OFFICER ORGANIZATIONS TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION. HERE HERE WE ARE TWO YEARS LATER AND THIS SAME LEGISLATURE IS NOW PROPOSING A MEASURE THAT HAS A STRIKINGLY SIMILAR LANGUAGE TO WHAT WAS ONCE NEGOTIATED AND REMOVED IN SB FIFTY FOUR AGAIN PROMISES MADE PROMISES NOT KEPT. IT IS THE DUTY OF OUR PEACE OFFICERS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS PEACE OFFICERS MUST COLLABORATE WITH FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO AVERT VERY REAL THREATS POSED BY FOREIGN TRANS TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL CARTELS. TERRACE AND OTHER STATEWIDE AND NATIONAL THREATS SHARING INFORMATION HELPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS SUCCESS IN OPERATIONS SHARING INFORMATION KEEPS CALIFORNIA SAFE. THIS BAIT AND SWITCH IS UNCONSCIOUS COUPLE. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE ON AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. IF YOU WERE GONNA ASK THAT YOU CAN TO KEEP. THE VOICES DOWN WE CAN READ A REALLY CARES IS HARD HERE CENTER BORDERS OR- ON THE SIDE OF. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT IN A- IN DARK IRONY I'M LOOKING AT THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION AS- INDIVIDUALS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE WE NOW WEARING HANDCUFFS. THAT'S WHAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES IT HAND CUFFS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THE IDEA THAT WE ARE TAKING. A YEAR BURDEN OF PROOF NORMALLY RESERVED FOR THE COURT ROOM HEY NOW INCORPORATING IT INTO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCESS TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS. THIS IS. THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON. LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. AND HI WE SEE A LOT OF BILLS. SOME OF THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL BUT A WHAT I'M SEEING REPEATEDLY IS THIS IDEA THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GUILTY BEFORE PRESUMED INNOCENT. WHEN WE SHOULD BE RESERVING THAT TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE ACCUSED SO I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS HANDCUFFING LAW ENFORCEMENT. EXCHANGING INFORMATION THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR SYSTEM IS ABOUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE NO ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THERE WILL BE OTHERS NO DOUBT THAT WILL COME IN THIS CYCLE OR IN THE NEXT CYCLE BUT THIS I THINK CROSSES THE LINE AND I ASK YOU TO RESPECT LAW ENFORCEMENT'S LINE. I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENIOR NINE SENATOR ALSO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU THIS BILL REQUIRES JUSTIFICATION FOR INCREASED SEEKING INFORMATION OTHER THAN CRIMINAL HISTORY INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THROUGH CLASS I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT AND ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

AS WE ALL KNOW OUR COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS ARE HURTING AND IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY BOTH LARGE AND SMALL PUBLICATIONS ARE FACING CHALLENGES WITH THE ADVERTISERS MOVING TO THE INTERNET AND ONLINE AGGREGATORS OF NEWS CUTTING THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS OUT. RECENTLY DECIED DYNAMIX DECISION BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ADDS TO THESE CHALLENGES BY CONVERTING NEWSPAPER CARRIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS FROM INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO EMPLOYEES. IT'S THE SMALL COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS THAT WE ALL HAVE IN OUR OWN AREAS NEWSPAPERS THAT SERVE RULE CALIFORNIA MONOLINGUAL COMMUNITIES IT'S THE ETHNIC PAPERS THAT SELLS WEEKLIES THAT SO MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS RELY ON TO ACCESS CRITICAL NEWS EVERY DAY.

YES CENTER MORLOCK THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. COLLEAGUES SO WEDNESDAY EVENING I PROFFERED AN AMENDMENT TO THE FOR ONE YEAR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FIVE FOR THE GIG ECONOMY. I LAMENTED THAT AB FIVE PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS. AB ONE SEVENTY PROVES MY POINT THANK YOU. THE OWNERS OF DYNAMICS HAVE DONE THE STATE A HUGE DISSERVICE. THEY MADE A BIG MISTAKE. BUT GOVERNMENT MAKES MISTAKES TO. WHEN A SALESMAN COMES IN AND CONVENTION TO DO SOMETHING THAT SEEMS ATTRACTIVE BUT IS NOT APPROPRIATE CAN WE ALL SAY RTA ABUSE. BUT A HODGE PODGE STRATEGY MAKES THE LEGISLATURE. A LITTLE DYSFUNCTIONAL AND MAYBE NOT HAVE A GOOD GRASP ON INCOME TAX AND PERSONAL OFF PERSONNEL LAW AND THEREFORE I SUGGEST AND STRONGLY RECOMMEND A NOBODY NO VOTE ON AB ONE SEVENTY THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. YOU CENTER DALLAS. NAME IS RESIDENT MEMBERS I ALSO. COME UP TO RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I SPOKE IN VERY HIGH DETAIL ABOUT THE DYNAMICS CASE AND- PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS IN. THE STATE ASSEMBLY SENATE YOU KNOW MARK TWAIN QUOTED DID NEVER PICK A FIGHT WITH PEOPLE WHO BUY INK BY THE BARREL. AND I'M NOT TRYING TO PICK A FIGHT WITH MY LOCAL PAPERS BY ANY MEANS. BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT I HAVE A HOSPITAL THAT CANNOT HIGHER NOW AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST PART TIME TO COME AND DO SURGERY IN MY RULE COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T EXEMPTS THEM. LONG WITH THERE'S A PHYSICAL THERAPIST ALONG WITH INFINITE TRUCKERS. THERE ARE REALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO NEED THIS EXEMPTION AND THIS LEGISLATURE'S PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS PERFECT EXAMPLE THIS BILL RIGHT HERE. WE NEED TO DO A VISIT A BUSINESS EXEMPTION. YES WAS DYNAMAX WRONG ABSOLUTELY THEY WERE EMPLOYEES. THEN THEY TEN NINETY NINE THEM AND MADE THEM. CONTRACTORS THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE IN BUSINESS THAT TEN NINETY NINE EACH OTHER EVERY DAY SUCH AS MYSELF I DO THE SAME THINGS WITH BUSINESS TO BUSINESS. WE NEED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUS AND WE NEED TO EXEMPT THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING IN BUSINESS TO BUSINESS. FIRED A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL WE'RE GONNA BE DOING THIS. ALL YEAR NEXT YEAR IF WE'RE GONNA PICK ONE AT A TIME. LET'S FIX IT RIGHT TAKE CARE OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING BUSINESS TO BUSINESS. AND GO OUT TO THOSE BAD ACTORS LIKE DYNAMAX. AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPLOITING WORKERS ABSOLUTELY. BUT THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK WE'RE GONNA BE DOING THIS. ALL NEXT YEAR GENOVA. THANK YOU CENTER STONE. MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES A. B. ONE SEVENTY AS WE KNOW IS A SISTER BILL TO AB FIVE EXEMPTS NEWSPAPER DISTRIBUTORS FOR ONE YEAR. FROM THE DYNAMICS APPLICATION AND I SHARE THE SAME. VIEWPOINTS IS MY SPEAKER RIGHT BEFORE OUR FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AT THAT. WE DON'T CONDONE WITH DYNAMICS DID. AND TO BROAD BRUSH CAN THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER AS WERE DOING IS GOING TO HURT THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD ALTHOUGH THIS BILL DOES MARGINAL AND TEMPORARY RELIEF TO ONE OF THE MANY INDUSTRIES NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE DYNAMICS DECISION THE FACT REMAINS. THAT THIS BILL REPRESENTS YET AGAIN ANOTHER CAR ABOUT FOR A FAVORITE INDUSTRY AB ONE SEVENTY AS ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S PICKING WINNERS AND PICKING LOSERS THIS MEASURE SISTER BILL AB FIVE PROVIDED EXEMPTIONS FOR MANY PROFESSIONS. THAT HAVE THE MONEY TO GET LOBBYIST UP HERE AND SPEND MONEY AND GET THE DESIRED OUTCOME BUT IT BARELY SCRATCHES THE SURFACE OF ALL OF THE AFFECTED INDUSTRIES THAT ARE GONNA BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. BY THIS BILL. CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES NEED A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE DYNAMICS DECISION. WE NEED A METHOD APPLIES TO ALL INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA NOT JUST THOSE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET THEMSELVES ADDED TO THE AB FIVE CAR ABOUT TRADE. THE FACT THAT THERE'S EVEN A CAR ABOUT TRAIN PERFECTLY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE DYNAMAX DECISION IS WRONG IN OTHER WORDS. OF THE AUTHOR OF AB TAT AB ONE SEVENTIES TWENTY NINE TEN HEARING I'M QUOTING HER THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'D EVER CARRIED A BILL THAT I AM DEFINITELY OPPOSED TO I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAID THIS WASN'T HEARTBREAKING FOR ME. THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE FEW TIMES I AGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS CHAIR AB ONE SEVENTY. BREAKS MY HEART AS WELL JUST LIKE THE ALL POWERFUL CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I'M OPPOSED TO THE POLICY. BEHIND THE BILL HOWEVER. BECAUSE I AM IN SUPPORT OF LEGISLATION THAT HELPS BUSINESSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB ONE SEVENTY. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO. THIS IS VERY. VERY CONFUSING TESTIMONY SOMETIMES. I RISE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I ALSO RISE TO RAISE CONCERNS I AGREE HOME PORT IN THE FREE PRESS IS AN WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE AS THOSE BUSINESSES THRIVE AT THE WORKERS TO DELIVER THOSE NEWSPAPERS ARE GIVEN THE PROPER WORKER PROTECTIONS AND WORKING CONDITIONS. HIS NEWSPAPER DELIVERY CARRIERS OF THE ONES WHO WAKE UP AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO MAKE SURE THE PAPERS ARE DELIVERED BY FOUR AM. THEY DID NOT GET DAYS OFF THE CARS GET DAMAGED THEY MUST COVER MANY MILES AND GAS ALL AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE. SO COLLEAGUES. I RISE TO SUPPORT BECAUSE THIS BILL WAS AMENDED TO INCLUDE A ONE YEAR DELAY. FROM THE DYNAMICS REQUIREMENTS FOR NEWSPAPER CARRIERS. BECAUSE OF THE ONE YEAR I SURPRISED TO SUPPORT AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT. RAZA SENATOR GIRL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT WE'RE SO GLAD THAT THE AUTHOR IS LISTEN TO THE SENATE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IN ISSUE DISTILLATE FOR THOSE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRIES WHOSE LIVELIHOODS WILL BE THREATENED BY AB FIVE BUT THOSE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE NOT ALONE. THE THEIR INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER INDUSTRIES OUT THERE STILL SEEKING A CARVE OUT OF AB FIVE THESE INCLUDED TRUCKING INDUSTRY INCLUDING SINGLE TRUCK OWNER OPERATORS BROKERS MEDICAL PROFESSIONS LOW PROFESSIONALS LAB TECHS NURSE ANESTHESIOLOGISTS. OPTOMETRISTS PHYSICAL THERAPISTS RESPIRATORY THERAPIST MASSAGE THERAPIST SOCIAL WORKERS OCCUPATIONAL SEX THERAPIST SPEECH THERAPIST BEHAVIORAL SERRA BUT THERAPIST TRUCK DRIVERS REPAIR PERSON CATERS TAXI CAB DRIVERS REGISTER PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS LICENSE TIMBER OPERATORS INTERPRETER INTERPRETERS MUSICIANS RABBIS FRANCHISEES. IN FRANCHISE OR IT'S JUST TO NAME A FEW. THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT FORTH TODAY'S AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL BECAUSE WE ASSN INSTEAD OF PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS FOR THIS BODY IN THIS LEGISLATURE TO CREATE A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION FOR ALL INDUSTRIES ACROSS THE BOARD SO THAT THIS BILL CAN BE WORKED OUT PROPRLY. BUT A VOTE FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE IT DOES TO A ONE YEAR DEAL IT DOES PROVIDE A ONE YEAR DELAY FOR OUR NEWSPAPERS THAT DESPERATELY NEED IT. BUT I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE INTENDED TARGET OF THIS BILL THE GIG ECONOMY BIRD LEFT DOOR DASH. LET'S SEE DOOR DASH UBER EATS POSTMASTERS X. SETTER AT. THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT EVEN GONNA BE COVERED UNDER THIS BILL BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT THAT HOPEFULLY WILL GO TO COURT AND WIN ABOUT BEING A PLATFORM AND NOT AN EMPLOYER YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ACCESS AID. BEAUTIFULLY CREATED PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GET ONLINE AND FIGURE OUT WHERE PEOPLE ARE REQUESTING SERVICES AND THEN GAIN RESOURCES BY PROVIDING SERVICES THE PEOPLE THAT USE THE SAME PLATFORM SO THEY'RE NOT EVEN DRIVERS THESE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN WORK FOR YOU BRING LEFT AND SOMEONE FORTUNATELY THEY'RE PROBABLY A MANY A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE GOING TO BE HURT BY THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT I DO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR THE ONE YEAR XTENSION FOR THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED AND I WOULD ASK OF FOR IT A AN AYE VOTE ON THIS TO SUPPORTER NEWSPAPER FRIENDS. BUT THESE CAR ABOUT SPERM ARE AND THE ONES THAT ARE NOT THE ONES THAT ARE BEING LEFT OUT FROM THIS CAR ABOUT TRAINING LEFT AT THE STATION. ARE UNACCEPTABLE.

THEY ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO STEP UP AND DO THEIR WORK WITH ALL DUE DILIGENCE WITHIN THE ONE YEAR THEY ARE GIVEN BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE AUTHOR'S DESIRE NOR MINE AS THE FLOOR JACQUI TO SEE A NOTHER YEAR WHERE NEWSPAPER CARRIERS ARE ABUSED AND MISTREATED BY THE PEOPLE WHO THEY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH AGAIN I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

WITHOUT OBJECTION IN OUR MOVIE TO FILE ITEM TWENTY THREE CENTER LIVE ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THAT ITEM. SHE IS READY SHE'S COMING MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE RATE. ASSEMBLY BILL TEN SIXTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ AN ACCOLADE UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION AND MAKING A PREPARATION THERE FOR. WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. MEMBERS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING TODAY THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO WE MANY TIMES TIP THE SCALES IN THE FAVOR OF LARGE CORPORATIONS AND LARGE COMPANIES RARELY DO WE EVER GET TO TIP THE SCALES IN THE FAVOR OF WORKERS TODAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT I RISE 2% AB TEN SIXTY SIX WHICH WOULD PROVIDE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR STRIKING AND LOCKED OUT WORKERS. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT WHY SHOULD WE TIP THE SCALES IN FAVOR OF WORKING PEOPLE BECAUSE WE DO SO MUCH FOR CORPORATIONS WE WANT CORPORATIONS TO BE SUCCESSFUL ABSOLUTELY BUT WE ALSO WANT THEM TO SHARE THEIR MONEY AND THEIR PROFITS WITH THE PEOPLE. THAT PUSH THE MONEY UP TO THEM. WE KNOW THAT EARLIER THIS YEAR ACTIONS LAST YEAR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. GRANTED A TAX CUTS TO CORPORATIONS. AND WE WERE ALL TOLD THAT THAT TAX CUT WOULD TRICKLE DOWN TO WORKERS AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED WE KNOW THAT THESE CORPORATIONS TOOK THAT MONEY AND PLOWED BACK INTO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND THE BOARD MEMBERS. I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED WITH THAT MONEY CVS COULD HAVE GIVEN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR WORKERS AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR RAISE BUT THEY DIDN'T EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHEN YOU MAKE MINIMUM WAGE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IS LIFE CHANGING THAT CAN KEEP SOMEONE OUT OF LOSING APARTMENT. THAT CAN MOVE A FAMILY OUT OF A ONE BEDROOM HOME APARTMENT INTO A THREE BEDROOM APARTMENT. HOME DEPOT COULD HAVE ALSO GIVEN EACH ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR RACE BUT THEY DIDN'T MCDONALD'S COULD HAVE GIVEN EVERYONE OF THEIR WORKERS WORLDWIDE A FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR REYES AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE THE MONEY NEVER TRICKLES DOWN TO THE WORKERS THE MONEY STAYS WITH THE CORPORATIONS AND STAYS WITH THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE BOARD MEMBERS. YOUR PRICE AND OKAY CONNIE LABEL WHAT IS THIS HAVE TO DO WITH LOCKED OUT WORKERS LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH LOCKED OUT WORKERS THIS IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME BECAUSE AS MOST OF YOU KNOW I WAS A LABOR UNION BOSS FOR MANY YEARS AND I LOVE THAT JOB BECAUSE I LOVE REPRESENTING WORKERS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A JOB THAT CAN PAY THE BILLS. HELP ALL THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE ALL LIVE WORK AND HELP THE CONSTITUENTS THAT WE REPRESENT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. WE KNEW THAT BARGAINING WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT WITH THE GROCERY STORES ARE WE REPRESENTED THE THREE BIG CORPORATIONS ALBERTSONS RALPHS VONS. SO WHAT WE DID AS THEY WERE UNION BOSSES IS WE WENT OUT AND SPOKE TO ALL OF OUR MEMBERS AND WE SAID HE SENT THESE ARE GOING TO BE. TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS. WHAT YOU BE READY. RIGHT NOW YOU PAY NOTHING YOUR HEALTHCARE YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO START PAYING A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR COPAY. AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER SAID THEY SAID WE GET IT WE KNOW THIS WAS BEFORE OBAMACARE THIS IS BEFORE WE SAW INCREASES OR DECREASES IN HEALTH CARE. THIS IS WHEN WE WERE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE AND WE WERE SEEING. DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE. THE WORKERS UNDERSTOOD AND THEY SAID WE'RE READY WE'LL DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO WERE HAPPY TO PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE. WHAT WE COULDN'T KNOW AS A NION AT THAT TIME. WAS AT THESE THREE CORPORATIONS WERE PLANNING A STRIKE. THEY WERE PLAYING TO PUT SOMETHING ON THE TABLE THAT WOULD BE SO DETRIMENTAL TO THESE WORKERS. THAT WOULD LEAVE THEM NO CHOICE BUT TO GO ON STRIKE. BUT WE MET WITH THIRTY NINE BARGAINING SESSIONS WITH THESE EMPLOYERS. AND AFTER THIRTY NINE BARGAINING SESSIONS. UNFORTUNATELY WE CALLED A STRIKE AND THE MEMBERS AT ALL VOTED ON THIS. AND WHAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T WORK IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT DON'T KNOW. IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A MULTI BARGAINING. UNIT YOU HAVE EACH UNIT VOTE TO GO ON STRIKE BUT THAT UNIT DOESN'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF THEM THE STRIKE MIGHT BE CALLED AGAINST. AND WE MAKE THAT DECISION AT THE BARGAINING TABLE AND IT'S USUALLY THE EMPLOYER THAT'S THE WORST AT THE TABLE IN THIS CASE IT WAS VAUGHN'S UP HERE IT'S SAFE WAY. AND THE REASON THEY WERE THE WORST IS BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE AT THE TABLE. SOME OF THE COMMENTS THEY MADE WERE COMMENTS LIKE THIS I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS WOMAN SU ROAD CHECK. AND SHE SAID. IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GIVE PAY RAISES WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE PAY RAISES BECAUSE A MONKEY COULD DO THE JOB OF ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES. YOU IMAGINE THAT TELLING YOU THINKING OF YOUR EMPLOYEES AS MONKEYS. SO WE CALLED THE STRIKE AGAINST BONDS. ON OCTOBER SIXTH THIRD OF OCTOBER ELEVENTH OF TWO THOUSAND THREE. I WITHIN TWELVE HOURS ALBERTSONS AND RALPH HAD LOCKED OUT ALL OF THE WORKERS THEY RETALIATED AGAINST THEIR WORKERS. AND WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY NINE PICKET LINES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE THE LONGEST AND MOST CUT COSTLY STRIKE IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. THE THREE CEOS BIRD DILLON AND JOHNSTON PUT OUT LETTERS TO ALL OF THEIR WORKERS AND THEY SAID WE DON'T CARE STRIKE AS LONG AS YOU WANT. THE OFFER WILL NEVER GET BETTER. BUT WE KEPT HOPE ALIVE THE OFFER WOULD GET BETTER AND AS THE DAYS AND THE WEEKS AND THE MONTHS WORE ON. IT GOT HARDER AND HARDER PEOPLE LOST THEIR CARS PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES. IN THE THIRD MONTH OF THE STRIKE MEMBERS RAN OUT OF THEIR BENEFITS SO FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE HEALTHY THAT WAS OKAY. BUT FOR THE WORKERS WERE BATTLING CANCER CANCER I WILL NEVER FORGET THE I'LL W. YOU THE LONGSHOREMEN'S UNION STEPPED UP. THEY FOUND OUT EVERY SINGLE MEMBER WHO HAD CANCER AND THEY PAID THEIR HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WOULDN'T LOSE THEIR MEDICAL BENEFITS WHILE THEY WERE BATTLING CANCER. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT DISTRICT IT BLINDED COME DOWN THE PICKET LINES DID COME DOWN BECAUSE THE OFER DID GET BETTER. ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVENTH OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR AFTER FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS THIS PICK THE PICKET LINES CAME DOWN. IT'S STILL SOMETIMES HARD FOR ME TO TALK ABOUT IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL BECAUSE NO ONE GOES ON STRIKE UNLESS THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE TO DO. OUR THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OUT PEOPLE DON'T GIVE UP THEIR WAGES BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THAT THEY JUST KNOW THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OUT THEIR BACKS ARE TO THE WALL. I LOOK AT THE SEVENTY THOUSAND WORKERS. FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM WHO WERE LOCKED OUT OF SOME OF THE BRAVEST PEOPLE I WILL EVER KNOW. AND AFTER THE STRIKE WAS OVER WHAT THE COMPANY SAID TO US WAS. WE PLAN TO TAKE A HIT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO BREAK THE UNION. AND WHAT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THAT STATEMENT IS WHEN YOU BREAK THE UNION ME AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION YOU'RE NOT BREAKING ME. YOU'RE TRYING TO BREAK ALL THE WORKERS EVERY DAY AND MAKE MONEY IF THOSE WORKERS DON'T SHOW UP TO WORK THESE CORPORATIONS DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY. SO WHEN YOU WANT TO BREAK THE UNION YOU'RE NOT HARMING ME YOU'RE HARMING THE WORKERS THAT ARE DOING THE JOB FOR YOU. THOSE COMPANIES WERE WILLING TO LOSE TWO BILLION DOLLARS AN ATTEMPT TO BREAK THE UNION ATTEMPTED TO RETALIATE. AGAINST THE WORKERS. AB TEN SIXTY SIX WOULD DO. WHAT TIPPED THE SCALES. JUST A LITTLE BIT TO HELP WORKERS. SO THAT IF YOU WERE LOCKED OUT YOU CAN RECEIVE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ARE ONLY 26% OF YOUR ACTUAL WAGES. IF YOU'RE ON STRIKE AFTER FOUR WEEKS YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. SO MEMBERS. I JUST ASK YOU TODAY. WE'RE ALWAYS SO WILLING TO TIP THE SCALES IN THE FAVOR OF CORPORATIONS. WHO NEVER HELP THEIR WORKERS. TODAY COULD WE TIP THE SCALES IN THE FAVOR OF WORKERS THE PEOPLE THAT WE ALL REPRESENT THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ANY DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEMS CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES AND I. I SIT HERE IN AMAZEMENT WHEN I HEAR MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO SAY THAT CAN WE ONCE TIPPED THE SCALES IN THE FAVOR OF UNIONS AND UNION WORKERS. AND NOT IN FAVOR OF CORPORATIONS. MY FRIENDS THIS IS JUST ANOTHER. ANOTHER BILL IN THE SEQUENCE OF UNION. BILLS THEY WERE SAYING PART OF THE UNION CAUCUS PRIORITIES AND IT'S JUST KIND OF DISCONCERTING TO. HEAR THE VILIFICATION OF CORPORATE COMPANIES THAT DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT CONTRIBUTE TO US HAVE BEEN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND YOU KNOW IT YOU TALK ABOUT THE GREED OF CORPORATIONS WELL WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THEIR PROFITS. MOST OF THEM ARE PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATIONS AND MANY OF OUR SENIOR CITIZENS ACTUALLY GET DIVIDENDS WHEN THOSE COMPANIES DO WELL. THEY DO WELL. AND WITH THE STRESSES THAT ARE SENIOR CITIZENS HAVE TODAY WITH SOCIAL SECURITY WHICH BARELY PAYS A- LIVING WAGE AND MEDICARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THEY NEED THIS INCOME SO THAT THEY DON'T BECOME HOMELESS. IN THEIR GOLDEN YEARS. HERO. I'LL BET YOU THERE'S NOT ONE PERSON IN HERE EXCEPT ME IT IS ACTUALLY OWNED A BUSINESS THAT MADE IT UNION HAD UNANIMOUS LOYALTIES AND SERVED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. HAVING TWENTY THOUSAND. UNION MEMBERS. AND WHILE I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE CITY OF TEMECULA. NEVER HAD ONE STRIKE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT. CONTRARY TO MY RHETORIC IN COMMENTS AND MARKING THE UNION CAUCUS THIS PAST WEEK I'VE HAD A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH LABOR AND MY TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF BEING AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. AND IN MY YEARS OF OWNING MY UNION PHARMACIES AND HAVING EMPLOYEES WITH VERY LITTLE TURN AROUND. BECAUSE THERE WILL TAKING CARE OF. BUT MY FRIENDS I MUST RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. MY WORRY IS THAT PROVIDING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO EXISTING WORKERS WHO CHOOSE TO GO ON STRIKE. WE WOULD BE REMOVING AN INCENTIVE FOR THE EMPLOYEES TO COME TO THE BARGAINING TABLE AND NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH FOR THE MORE. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS NOT FOR WORKERS THAT HAVE VOLUNTARILY LEFT A JOB. AB TEN SIXTY SIX GOES BEYOND THAT. AND PROVIDES THESE BENEFITS TO WORKERS THAT ARE STILL EMPLOYED. UNIONS ALREADY PLANNED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR STRIKING MEMBERS WITH STRIKING ACCOUNTS FUNDED BY UNION DUES WHICH ALWAYS GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE AND NEVER COMING DOWN. AND SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. WELL I WILL ADMIT THAT THIS IS A CREATIVE WAY FOR UNIONS TO ELIMINATE THE NEED TO CREATE A RESERVE FOR THE STRIKING MEMBERS. THEREBY FREEING UP MUCH OF THEIR NEEDED FUNDS I JUST DON'T BELIEVE. THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED TO BOOST THE COFFERS OF UNIONS. THIS IN ALL LIKELIHOOD. AS MANY AS OF THE OTHER PIECES OF UNION LEGISLATION THAT WE SEEN THIS PAST WEEK. IS IN RESPONSE TO THE JANICE DECISION AND I KNOW THE UNIONS ARE UPSET ABOUT THE CHANCE DECISION. AND THIS IS A WAY. FOR THEM TO TRY TO OVERCOME. THEIR DISDAIN. FOR THAT SUPREME COURT DECISION. AGAIN LET'S RESERVE OUR EMPLOYMENT FUNDS FOR THOSE THAT ARE TRULY UNEMPLOYED. HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS OR BEEN TERMINATED. FOR THOSE REASONS I ASK A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I WANTED TO ADD ONE. I WANTED TO ADD ONE PIECES OF INFORMATION TO THIS DEBATE TO THE EXTENT IT'S HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND. THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL WAS NEGOTIATED LAST NIGHT. THAT IS CURRENTLY PENDING AT THE ASSEMBLY DESK SHOULD THE BILL WILL PASS AND BE HEARD ON CONCURRENCE AND I'LL JUST READ PERMISSION TO READ FROM THIS LETTER TO THE JOURNAL. PERMISSION GRANTED OKAY A TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS LEGISLATION IT IS MY INTENT TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND EDT. TO REVIEW DATA ON THE IMPACTS OF THIS POLICY CHANGE ON THE U. I. PROGRAMS. INCLUDING THE INTERPLAY WITH ANY LABOR DISPUTE RELATED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. AND WHETHER THIS POLICY CHANGE WOULD IMPACT FUND'S SOLVENCY IN ANY WAY AS WELL AS OTHER IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS. SHOULD THE POLICY CHANGE UNDER AB TEN SIXTY SIX RESULT IN ANYTHING MORE THAN A NEGLIGIBLE IMPACT ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND IT IS MY INTENT THAT ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION BE PURSUED TO LIMIT. ANY ADVERSE FISCAL IMPACTS ON THE FUND. I KNOW THAT THIS WAS A CENTRAL ISSUE OF CONCERNED IN TERMS OF THE SOLVENCY OF THE FUND AND THERE ARE THERE COMPETING SETS OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS LEGISLATION BUT I THOUGHT THAT CLARIFYING THE AUTHOR'S INTENT SHOULD IT PASS AND ARRIVE AT THE ASSEMBLY WOULD BE HELPFUL IN MAKING YOUR DECISION. THANK YOU MEMBERS. DO ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION DEBATES YES CENTER MOREAU THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT. BUT THE PRESENTATION OF THIS BILL AS WELL AS SOME OTHER BILLS. LINCOLN SAID THAT A HOUSE DIVIDED WILL FALL AND IT'S INTERESTING WHEN PEOPLE MAKE THEIR- ARGUMENTS ON THIS FLOOR. THE PIT A NEIGHBOR AGAINST NEIGHBOR FRIEND AGAINST FRIEND BUSINESS AGAINST. OTHER BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES JUST LIKE AB FIVE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT WINNERS VERSES LOSERS AND NOW WE PIT EMPLOYEES AGAINST EMPLOYERS JUST TO BE ABLE TO GET A BILL THROUGH. AND AGAIN THE UNIONS ARE DOING DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY AND OUR STATE I'M CONVINCED THAT AND THIS IS BECOMING A UNION ST AND WE WILL LOSE MORE JOBS AND COUNTER THAT THIS BILL AS WELL AS AB FIVE. AND AGAIN I THINK THE POINT THAT I JUST WANNA SAY IS I JUST THINK THE WAY THE BILL IS PRESENTED IT THIS BODY TENDS TO. PET. PEOPLE AGAINST PEOPLE SO I SPOKE MY PIECE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF IT ON THE SIDE OF. XENON SURLY WHICH OUGHT TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT OF I'VE I FEEL BADLY THAT TWO OF THE SPEAKERS TO NOT LISTEN TO ANYTHING THAT I SAID. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE GENESIS ASIAN I WAS TALKING ABOUT AN EXPERIENCE THAT HAPPENED SIXTEEN YOU YEARS AGO WELL BEFORE THE JANICE DECISION EVER CAME INTO BEING. AND I WAS NOT SPEAKING ABOUT AB FIVE AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT HITTING ANYONE AGAINST EACH OTHER I'M TYING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WORKING PEOPLE ARE LIVING AROUND US EVERY DAY THAT WOULD WORKING PEOPLE DON'T SUCCEED NONE OF US SUCCEED. AND PEOPLE YOU KNOW I WAS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT FOR THIRTY YEARS FROM THE TIME I WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL UNTIL I TOOK THIS JOB AND IN THIRTY YEARS THERE WAS ONE STRIKE. IS A MASSIVE STRIKE BUT THERE WAS ONE STRIKE BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T TAKE IT LIGHTLY MEMBERS DO NOT CHOOSE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING BECAUSE- THEY THINK IT'S GOING TO BE EASY. AND IN A WIN WIN. THE CALL OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM TEMECULA TALKS ABOUT A UNION FUND WHAT'S CALLED A STRIKE FUND AND YES WE DO YOU JUNIOR INDUCED TO PUT THAT AWAY. BUT IN MY LOCAL UNION WHICH WAS SOLVENT AND WE WERE VERY FRUGAL WITH OUR MONEY WE HAD TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WE ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO TREAT COMPETE WITH THE CORPORATION WHO SET ASIDE TWO BILLION DOLLARS. TO LOSE TWO MILLION VERSUS TWO BILLION. SO AGAIN I'M JUST GOING TO ASK ALL OF YOU THINK ABOUT TIPPING THE SCALES TOWARDS WORKERS TODAY WE DON'T MIND PRACTICING CORPORATE WELFARE WHEN WE HAVE CORPORATIONS. THEY TEACH THEIR EMPLOYEES HOW TO GO ON WELFARE AND HOW TO GO ON FOOD STAMPS WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. LET'S DO SOMETHING FOR WORKERS TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE A TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAO AN ACCOLADE TO PRIVACY. JACKSON THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES THIS IS A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS EVERY CONSUMER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE BUYING AND SELLING. OF OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION LAST YEAR WE ENACTED THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AND IN DOING SO THIS LEGISLATURE GAVE CALIFORNIANS MANY OF THE NECESSARY. THANK YOU GAVE ME A ARE LAST YEAR WE BY ENACTING THIS LEGISLATION THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT THE LEGISLATURE GAVE CALIFORNIANS MANY OF THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. STRTING JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIANS WILL BE ABLE TO EXERCISE OUR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS TO MONITOR AND CONTROL HOW ARE DATA IS USED SOLD. OR OTHERWISE EXCHANGE BUT THESE RIGHTS ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS A CONSUMERS POWER TO ENFORCE THEM AND A KEY COMPONENT OF TAKING CHARGE IS TO SIMPLY KNOW. WHAT BUSINESSES ARE HOLDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. TO THAT END THIS BILL SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT DATA BROKERS. TO FIND GENERALLY AS BUSINESSES THAT ARE COLLECTING AND SELLING THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CONSUMERS WITH WHOM THEY HAVE NO DIRECT RELATIONSHIP. IT WILL REQUIRE THAT THESE DATA BROKERS REGISTER WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD THEN BE REQUIRED TO CREATE A REGISTRY AND HOST THAT INFORMATION ON ITS WEBSITE. BY REQUIRING DATA BROKERS TO REGISTER WITH THE STATE WE CAN TAKE A SMALL LEGISLATIVE STEP. THAT IMPOSES MINIMAL BURDENS ON THE BUSINESSES THAT BENEFIT FROM THE EXCHANGE OF OUR INFORMATION AND IT POWER CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ANY DESCRIPTION OF IT ON THIS I DON'T SENATOR TO BURKE. YEAH I THINK IT'S A COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH THE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE AND PURPOSE IN FRAMEWORK. OF THE PRIVACY ACT I ASK YOUR SUPPORT.

A GREATER ABILITY TO KNOW WHO THESE DATA BROKERS ARE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PEOPLE WITH WHOM WE HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BUT THIS IS A GOOD START TO REQUIRE THAT THE DATA BROKERS WHO DO IN FACT TAKE AND USE AND SELL OUR INFORMATION.

SENATOR JACKSON'S READY MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL TWO EIGHTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ AND ACT REALLY TO CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT SENATOR JACKSON'S. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING COLLEAGUES TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTEEN. BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ THIS MEASURE WOULD EXTEND THE CIVIL STATURE IT'LL LIMITATIONS FOR VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT. FOR MAGE TWENTY SIX TO AGE FORTY AND IN CASES OF THE LATE DISCOVERY FROM THREE YEARS AFTER THE DISCOVERY TO FIVE THE BILL WOULD ALSO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES RECOVERABLE IN INSTANCES WHERE THERE WAS A COVER UP. WHICH LED TO THE ABUSE AND ALLOW FOR SHORT THREE YEAR WINDOW FOR PAST VICTIMS WHO A SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS. WE KNOW IN THE RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS THAT IT CAN TAKE DECADES FOR MOST VICTIMS TO BE READY TO COME FORWARD TO ACTUALLY EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS EVENT WHICH SHAPE IN SUPPRESSING THIS HORRIFIC EVENT OR EVENTS. HAD THEY BEEN SUPPRESSING FOR DECADES WERE IN FACT UP PART OF THEIR LIVES AND IMPACTED A GREAT DEAL OF THEIR LIVES. IT IS THEN WHEN THEY COME FORWARD BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE STATUTE DOES ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO SEEK REDRESS. SO THIS DENIES JUSTICE TO VICTIMS IT ALLOWS THE PERPETRATORS OF THE ABUSE IN THOSE COMPLICIT TO CONTINUE PRAYING ON CHILDREN OR OTHERWISE TURNING A BLIND EYE WE ALL OF HEARD THE STORIES. AND THE POWER THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE HAD OVER THESE USUALLY YOUNGSTERS BRINGING THIS ABUSE IN THE SHAME AND- DIFFICULTIES CONNECTING WITH LIFE AND BEING ABLE TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. UNTIL THEY GO THROUGH THERAPY. WHICH CAN TAKE SOME TIME SO THE LAST TIME CALIFORNIA OPEN THE WINDOW FOR OLD CASES. IN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND THREE NINE HUNDRED VICTIMS CAME FORWARD THE EXPOSED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY CHILD MOLESTERS AND SAVE THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN FROM BECOMING FUTURE TARGETS. HOWEVER WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE STILL OUT THERE. WHO WOULD NOT MADE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THEIR ABUSE AND CURRENT PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURY AT THE TIME. OF THE OPENING WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED TO BE ABLE TO BRING THESE CASES BECAUSE OF OUR HOW OUR LAWS CURRENTLY WRITTEN THEY WILL NEVER HAVE A CHANCE TO COME FORWARD AND PURSUE LEGAL CRANE CLAIMS. WE KNOW WE CAN NEVER A RACE THE PAIN BUT THIS MEASURE WILL EXPAND ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT BY GRANTING THE MORE TIME TO PURSUE THEIR LEGAL REMEDIES. THIS HOPEFULLY WILL HELP EXPOSE PERPETRATORS WHO HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND DE DECADES ABUSING OUR MOST VULNERABLE YOUTH. AND THIS WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ANY DESCRIPTION OF THE BAIT ON THE SIDE ON SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I AGREE WITH THE POOR MANAGER THAT ARE WRITING THE WRONGS OF PAST SINCE IS A RIGHT JUSTIN AND JUST THING TO DO. AND I CONCUR THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ILLNESS CAUSED BY. CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSES IS NOT DISPUTED. THIS HARM REQUIRES EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING COUNSELING AND INCLUDING FOR SOME SPIRITUAL COUNSELING COLLEAGUES THERE IS NOTHING MORE FRUSTRATING THAN A SELF INFLICTED WOUND ALL THE MORE SO IF IT IS INTENTIONAL. AB TWO ONE EIGHT EXPOSES CALIFORNIA STRAP SCHOOL DISTRICTTHE POTENTIAL LAWSUIT SETTLEMENTS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE AND IN THE REMOTE CHANCE THAT THEY ARE. WE'LL SEE INSURANCE PREMIUM SKYROCKET. OR CARRIERS DISAPPEAR. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THAT WITH THE HOMEOWNERS IN W. YOU AYE AREAS. OF CALIFORNIA'S NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY AUDITED SCHOOL DISTRICTS ONLY 9510% HAVE POSITIVE UNRESTRICTED DEPOSITIONS WHAT FURTHER CUTS WILL HAVE TO BE MADE. WE SHOULD NOT SHOULD THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE FOOT I URGE A NO VOTE. ON AB TWO ONE EIGHT THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THE FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I SPEAK IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS ITEM. AS A PERSON WHO WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED AS A CHILD. AND WHILE I NEVER FORGOT ABOUT THAT ABUSE I. WAS ON ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT OR. GET MYSELF THE THERAPY I NEEDED I DISPIRITED I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO SO UNTIL I WAS ADULT AND IN FACT WHAT TRIGGERED. MY ABILITY TO CONFRONT IT. WAS WHEN MY OWN DAUGHTER BECAME THE AGE THAT I WAS WHEN MY BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; STARTED. THE&lt;/c&gt; DATA SHOWS. THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO WERE ABUSED AS CHILDREN. IT HAPPENS BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY SOMEONE WHO THEY TRUST AND THEY'RE NOT IN A SETTING IN A HOUSEHOLDER OTHER SETTING WHERE THEY FEEL THEY ARE ABLE. TO CONVEY WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AND BE PROTECTED. AND SO YOU CARRY THAT WITH YU WHICH KEEPS YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO CONVEY IT AND THUS ACT TO PROTECT YOURSELF UNTIL THE MOMENT THAT YOU ARE EITHER IN ADEQUATE THERAPY. OR YOU BREAK. THAT CAN BE. THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE ABUSE. SO TO DENY ANYONE FROM BEING ABLE TO SEEK THE APPROPRIATE DAMAGES TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT ABUSE IS WRONG I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. IT IS STILL TESTIMONY SENATE BILL. YES THIS THIS SIR ISSUE IS BEEN LEGISLATED IN THE PAST I% INTRODUCED THE BILL TWICE VETOED TWICE BY GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN I HOPE OUR NEW GOVERNOR HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND I YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS THIS THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING WITH WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS BILL ESTABLISH FOR THE LAST. EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AND ARJUN AYE VOTE ON IT IT WAS A BI PARTISAN SUPPORT WE PUT ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK I THINK TWO OR MAYBE THREE TIMES AND IT WAS ALWAYS VETOED SO LET'S GET THIS BILL SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. ARJUN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. TESTIMONY AND THIS ON THIS ISSUE. HERE NINETEEN NINE CENTER JACKSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THIS THANK YOU YOU KNOW THIS IS A HORRIFIC. CRIME THAT IS BEEN PERPETUATED ON FOR TOO MANY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. WITH THE COMPLICITY OF GROUPS LIKE THE CHURCH. AND IT IS BEYOND TIME THAT WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THESE VICTIMS DESERVE THEIR DAY IN COURT DESERVE THEIR VINDICATION AND THEIR TRUST US. IT IS A BEYOND TIMES THAT WE MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONDONE OR TOLERATE THIS BEHAVIOR GOING FORWARD. THIS BILL HELPS THOSE VICTIMS TRY TO HEAL AND GET THE JUSTICE THEY SO RIGHTLY DESERVE AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

THESE RICH SENATE BILL ONE BY SENATOR ATKINS AND HACK RELATING TO PUBLIC WELFARE. ATKINS MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND COLLEAGUES THANK YOU SO MUCH YET AGAIN FOR YOUR PATIENCE. SB ONE AN AXE THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORKERS DEFENSE ACTIVE TWENTY NINETEEN. THE ASSEMBLY AMENDMENTS RESOLVE NUMEROUS CONCERNS OVER THE CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER WORKER SAFETY AN ENDANGERED SPECIES PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. AS AMENDED SB ONE MAKES FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARDS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER PROTECTION ENFORCEABLE AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW ONLY WHEN THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON ROLE IN DC ROLLS THEM BACK TO BE CLEAR. SB ONE AND WE SAID THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN IMPOSES NO NEW REGULATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS ON BUSINESS AGRICULTURE OR THE STATE'S ECONOMY IT SIMPLY KEEP SOME PLACE THE SAME STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PACE AND IN SOME CASES FOR DECADES. BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON AND THE ROLL BACKS THAT THEY HAVE PUSHED FORWARD SB ONE IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH WORKER SAFETY IN ORGANIZED LABOR BUSINESS. AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS. I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN LAKE CONCERNS RAISED BY MY FRIENDS IN THE WATER IN THE AG COMMUNITY OVER THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE BILL. ON THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND OTHER ACTIONS TO PROTECT BILL TO WATER. I WOULD DIRECT MY COLLEAGUES TO PAGE THIRTEEN LINE NINETEEN OF THE BILL WHICH IS EXPRESSLY STATES THAT THE BILL DOES NOT AFFECT THE PROCESS BY WHICH THOSE AGREEMENTS ARE ENTERED INTO. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A BIG AND IMPORTANT MEASURE I THINK WE ARE LIVING IN TIMES THAT DEMAND OUR URGENT ACTION TO PROTECT OUR STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES OUR ENVIRONMENT AND WORKER SAFETY. I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR FIVE VOTE IN THE CONCURRENCE OF THE ASSEMBLY AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY DESCRIPTION OF IT ON THIS ISSUE CENTER NIELSEN. THIS PRESIDENT LADIES JOURNAL OF THE SENATE I HAVE TO LOSE VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION IS IN A SENSE I HAVE BEEN SERVING. IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. IT'S ROLLING BACK TWENTY YEARS OF PROGRESS TOWARDS ENDING THE WATER WARS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WILL REIGNITE THOSE WATER WARS. IT IGNORES PROVISIONS OF LAW THAT INDICATE THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A WATER RIGHT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SEEMS TO BE A HYSTERIC REACTION TO THINGS THAT HAVE GONE ON IN WASHINGTON DC. AND IF THAT'S IT. IT'S GOING TO LAST A LOT LONGER. MEETING. THE DEFICIENCIES AND THE HARM DONE HERE. THEN A FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. IT WILL DO NOTHING TO HEAL. OR TO HELP PROVIDE A WATER AROUND TO THE NEEDY AREAS OF CALIFORNIA OR TO REPLENISH OUR GROUNDWATER. OR TO GREECE IS. ON THE MOMENT I I'M. ON THE MOMENT IN THE COMMENTS THE. BIG OF THE THAT WAS THAT ARE HERE. THEY ARE ON THE AMENDMENTS HERE SENATOR. JUST MAKE SURE. THANK YOU OF SENATOR DODD SENATOR NELSON V. JUST BE GERMANE TO THE BILL TO SPEAK TO THE MEMBER TO APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. NOTHING IN THAT THAT IS IN THIS BILL THAT HAS BEEN AMENDED. WILL DO ANYTHING BUT FANNING THE FLAMES. OF THE WATER WARS AND MAKE IT WORSE. IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL READ A FEW. SECTIONS HERE IF I MAY. THAT CREATES PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION. AND MANY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE COME TO THE LEGISLATURE EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERNS. ASKING FOR SOME ACCOMMODATIONS OF THOSE CONCERNS. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE BACKS OF BEEN RUDELY TURNED UPON THEM. AND NOT ACCEPTED ANY SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE THIS LEGISLATION. THAT HAVE BEEN IN GOOD FAITH. WHAT TALK ABOUT VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS IN THE FUTURE. AND BUT BASED ON PROVISIONS HERE IN AND AS AMENDED. WHO IS GOING TO DARE. HAVE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE THEY CANNOT TRUST THE STATE THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN THIS STATE AND NATION TODAY. THE CITIZENS CANNOT TRUST GOVERNMENT TO KEEP ITS WORD. AT THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY THROUGH THE VALLEYS OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE AGREE JUSTLY HARMED BY THIS. ONE OF THE MOST SWEEPING ATTACKS. ON THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY THAT IS SO DEAR TO ME. THAT I WOULD HAVE EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFETIME IS EMBODIED. THIS LEGISLATION AS AMENDED. I ASK I IN TREAT. FOR THE GOOD OF THE GENERATIONS THIS ISN'T ABOUT NOW THIS IS ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WHEN WE'RE NEGOTIATING A NEW WATER PLAN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WAS MUCH ON OUR MINDS THOSE WHO DID THE NEGOTIATION. WHAT WOULD BE THE WATER FUTURE FOR THE STATE EVERYBODY. NOT JUST GROUPS AND NOT JUST WATER FOR FISH WATER FOR EVERYBODY. IN ALL SPECIES. THIS WILL NOT GET US THERE. IT IS ILL FOUNDED. A ROLL BACK THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE. AND HERE WE GO REIGNITING. THE WATER WARS. ANY ADDITIONAL. VERSION OF IT ON THE SIDE ON SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I THINK SO MANY OF US GOOD. COULD FIND ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS LEGISLATION SOUL ARE PROBABLY JUST PICK ONE OR TWO. F. I MADE DIRECT QUESTIONS TO. THE AUTHOR. SENATOR ACTIONS WE TAKE QUESTION YES THE ABORTION SO REPRESENTING THE CENTRAL VALLEY I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE IMPASSIONED WORDS OF MY COLLEAGUE WATERS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DYNAMIC IN OUR REGION FOR OBVIOUS OBVIOUS REASONS. IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME DEALING WITH IS OF COURSE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. AND ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN HERE THAT CONCERNS ME GREATLY IS THE IDEA THAT. THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION COULD ADOPT REGULATIONS THAT ADD SPECIES TO THAT ARE ON THE ENDANGERED LIST. BETTER FEDERAL ACTION RESULTS IN A DECREASE OF PROTECTION SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WOULD IT NOT BE. EFFECTIVE TO MONITOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS BY BRING BACK ANY STATUTORY REQUEST THAT DOESN'T CREATE A BASELINE AS THIS PIECE LEGISLATION DOES. GIVEN THE SMELLED ISSUE THE SALMON ISSUE THE DYNAMIC AND THE CHANGING IN THE EVOLVING SCIENCE THAT THIS KIND OF FREEZES IN TIME WOULD NOT BE MORE EFFECTIVE TO BRING BACK ANY THESE CONSIDERATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE RATHER THAN. ARE CREATING A BASELINE. THE WAY THIS LEGISLATION IS PROPOSED THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND ADD TO MY COLLEAGUES THERE WERE MANY MANY AMENDMENTS I IN IN. THE PROCESS OF SIX POLICY HEARINGS INTO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES WE SOUGHT TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF THOSE CONCERNS THE BASELINE HI I MEAN WE ARE NOT CHANGING REGULATIONS WE ARE ADOPTING THE BASELINE WE'VE ADDED LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. TO ADDRESS THE BEST POSSIBLE SCIENCE THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED AGAIN AND AGAIN WE ADDED THAT INTO THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL AT THE REQUEST AS WE DID. NEGOTIATIONS THROUGH THE PROCESS. FISHING GAME HIS GIVEN DISCRETION BUT IT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS TO DO ANY CHANGE WE ARE TRYING TO HAVE A BASELINE SET OF STANDARDS WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT INTO MY OTHER COLLEAGUES. THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WHICH GETS TO THE ISSUE OF YOUR THE BOTTOM LINE OF YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS WATER. THIS BILL DOESN'T IMPACT THE VOLUNTARY CELL AGREEMENTS WE PUT IT INTO THE INTO THE LANGUAGE OF. THE BILL IT IS SO. WE REALLY AND TRULY DID WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. IT'S FOR IN TERMS OF THE DISCRETION THAT FISH AND GAME. IS GIVEN IT'S FROZEN UNTIL FISHING GAME IS ABLE TO REVIEW IT'S NOT PERMANENT SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO DO THE REVIEW THAT'S NEEDED TO BE DONE. AND WE ARE TRYING TO PUT INTO PLACE THE PROTECTIONS THAT YOU HAVE OUTLINED IN TERMS OF THE VOLUNTARY SELL AGREEMENT. AS IT RELATES ALSO TO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT LET ME MAKE MAY BE HELPFUL FOLLOW UP ON THIS IF I MAN MISTER PRESIDENT. WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO FRESNO I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLERK. FOR A FEDERAL JUDGE WHO IS REGARDED NATIONALLY AS- THE WATER JUDGE. IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE EXPERIENCED WHEN WE WENT THROUGH ALL THE LITIGATIONS INVOLVING. THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT WAS THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. AND WHAT WE REALIZE OVER TIME IS THAT THE GREAT LATITUDE THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE IN DETERMINING THEIR INTERPRETATION OF BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WHICH IS WHY THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS SPENT YEARS LOBBYING. THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TO RE VISIT THEIR SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION. AND IT IS. UNFORTUNATELY COME TO LITTLE AVAIL BUT WHAT I'M CONCERNED MOST ABOUT THIS IS THAT IF WE DO SUCCEED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE WILL THEN LOSE AGAIN AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND THAT IS WHAT I'M TERRIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THIS LEGISLATION IS THAT WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR A DECADE OR MORE TRYING TO GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THE HUMAN ELEMENT IS A KEY COMPONENT IN UNDERSTANDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS WHEREAS BEFORE IT WAS ONLY ABOUT LET'S SAY A DELTA SMELT. BUT WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS A HUMAN ELEMENT THAT WAS CALCULATED IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. SO NOW AFTER A DECADE A DECADE OF FIGHTING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE COULD VERY WELL SEE OURSELVES WINNING IN WASHINGTON AND THEN LOSING IN CALIFORNIA. IN I DON'T KNOW WHAT. JUST TO COME HERE AND SAY WE SHOULD OPPOSE THIS I THINK IS OVERLY SIMPLISTIC I THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE DEEP SYSTEMIC AND FUNDAMENTAL BY BY VIRTUE OF THAT BASELINE ON DOES ALL THE POLITICAL WORK THAT WE HAVE SEEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT COULD BE OF GREAT VALUE TO THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY AND IN ALL THOSE INTERESTED PARTIES INVOLVING THE WATER WARS. SO ALL IN ALL IN MY COMMENT MY COMMENTS HERE. WITH ONE LAST QUESTION TO YOU IF I MAY. THERE WAS IN THE MEDIA REPORTS THAT DEMOCRAT FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES FEINSTEIN IN OTHERS HAD EXPRESSED GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SB ONE. HAVE YOU ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS OR DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO. THE LETTER THAT WAS SENT TO YOUR OFFICE REGARDING SB ONE. THANK YOU. WELL HI I WOULD SAY. THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OUR AS IT RELATES TO WATER FLOWS AND THE VOLUNTARY SETTLE AGREEMENTS HAS BEEN LONG AND DISCUSSION AND SETTLED AT AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL UNTIL WE GOT A NEW ADMINISTRATION. THESE ARE THESE ARE PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR. FORTY YEARS SO I WILL SAY. WE A THE BUT THE POINT IS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS ROLLING OUT THAT WE HAVE LIVED UNDER FOR QUITE AWHILE. OUR DELEGATE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THAT OUR REPRESENTATIVES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND OUR DELEGATION THAT WANT TO SEE THOSE STANDARDS ROLLED BACK TO THIS IS WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AT THE STATE TO PROTECT SOME ENDANGERED SPECIES AND THE DELTA ECO SYSTEM. I DON'T SEE THAT YOU FIND THIS ISSUE BEING DETERMINED ALONG POLITICAL LINES IT'S DETERMINED ALONG SOME GEOGRAPHICAL LINES AS IT RELATES TO THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS ABOUT WATER FLOWS. SO WE HAVE DEBATED THESE ISSUES TIME AND TIME AGAIN AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND SO I DO BELIEVE THAT. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO ROLLBACK. PROTECTIONS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE FOR OUR NATURAL RESOURCES ARE ENDANGERED SPECIES SO THAT IS THE POINT OF A LARGE PART OF THIS LEGISLATION. I EIGHT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS DON'T ALWAYS AGREE I MEAN IF IT IF IT IS A POLITICAL IF YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS A POLITICAL THING AGAIN SEE ADMINISTRATION OBVIOUSLY IT ISN'T IT IS ABOUT. THE PROTECTION IMMIGRANT RIGHTS DISAGREE. HI AND IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE RATHER THAN HAVE CROSSED DEBATE. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE VERY REASON THIS LEGISLATION IS NECESSARY IS TO PROTECT. OUR RESOURCES AND MAYBE FIVE THERE ARE OF POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS BY DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WHO DISAGREE BUT THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN DEBATED. OF FOR WELL OVER FORTY YEARS IN TERMS OF CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER OUR NATURAL RESOURCES THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND THE LET THE POINT OF THIS LEGISLATION IS TO. KEEP THOSE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. OR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING THE MY INQUIRIES ALL MY FINAL COMMENT IS. IF EVER THERE WAS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I THINK COULD BENEFIT FROM MORE ANALYSIS IN MORE DISCUSSION I THINK YOU'D BE SB ONE. THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT CANDIDATE IF THIS WERE ROLLED OVER INTO THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE CYCLE. I LEAVE THAT TO THE VOTE COUNT AT THE END BUT I THINK MORE CONSULTATION ESPECIALLY FROM FOLKS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY COULD MAKE THIS A BETTER PIECE OF LEGISLATION WITH MORE WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU SINISTER. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I DO APPRECIATE THE LINE OF QUESTIONING IN THE RESPONSES THE WATER CHAIR THE SENATE I DID WANT TO WEIGH IN IS JOIN AUTHOR THIS LEGISLATION. THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY. UNDER WAY BEING NEGOTIATED THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY APPROPRIATED FUNDING FOR IN OUR BUDGET THIS CYCLE. I BELIEVE ARE NOT ONLY CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF OUR STATES WATER STRATEGY BUT. THEY ARE NOT IMPEDED BY THIS LEGISLATION. WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO IS WHETHER YOU TRUST THIS ADMINISTRATION TO IMPLEMENT THIS LEGISLATION IN A MEANINGFUL FASHION. THAT UP HOLD THOSE AGREEMENTS. BIT INTERPRETS THE BASELINE STANDARDS AND THAT. INTERPRETS EXISTING LAW WHICH ALREADY APPLIES THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT FOR INSTANCE TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. THERE IS PLENTY OF DISCRETION UNDER EXISTING LAW AND OF SB ONE PASSES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN FIND SMART NEGOTIATED SOLUTIONS TO ENSURING THAT CENTRAL VALLEY AS ADEQUATE WATER SUPPLY. THAT AGRICULTURE IS PUT IN A SUSTAINABLE POSITION. BUT THAT WE ALSO DON'T UNDER CUT. AN EXTINCT OUR MOST SACRED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE CALIFORNIA ECOSYSTEM. WE DIDN'T WANT TO GET PUT IN THIS POSITION. WE GOT FORCED INTO THIS LEGISLATION. AND YOU MAY CALL POLITICS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WASHINGTON. HAS DECIDED TO SINGLE OUT THIS STATE. AND TRY TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUT OF US. AND THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT INTENDED TO POKE THIS ADMINISTRATION IN THE I'D. BUT IT DIDN'T INTENDED IS STATUS UNCERTAINTY TO SAY THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BACKWARDS. AND THE TRACK WE WERE ON WAS WORKING AND IS STILL CAN WORK AND I BELIEVE THIS GOVERNOR CAN MAKE THIS LEGISLATION WORK. IF THEY PUT THEIR MINDS TO SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE TODAY AND I DO APPRECIATE THE PRO TEM'S. COURAGEOUS LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN A TOUGH CONVERSATION THAT. WE NEVER WANTED TO HAVE TO HAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE. BY THIS INSURANCE POLICY FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF THE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES. AND AGRICULTURE RESOURCES IS CRITICALLY NEEDED AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU CENTER Y. COSBY. IS RISEN AYE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE IN AND I ECHO MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE DIDN'T BRING THIS ON INTO OUR SET UPON OURSELVES THIS IS BROUGHT TO US IN I WOULD REMIND MEMBERS THAT THIS MEASURE SUNSETS IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND- MY READING OF THE FLOOR ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT THE- EXTRA INSURANCE YOU KNOW. ADD TO LEGAL INTERPRETATION PROVISION REGARDING THE DEFINITIONS OF WASTE AND WATER OF THE STATE AND- THE POWER OR THE AUTHORITY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME HAS SO AS NOT TO AFFECT EXISTING INTERPRETATIONS WE ARE SIMPLY. KEEPING THE STATUS QUO AND AS A. SELF PROCLAIMED PROGRESSIVE AND LIBERAL IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA I THINKS THE KEEPING THE STATUS QUO IS NOT A BIG STRETCH AND I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GROWTH THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL IF THIS BILL PASSES THE SENATE WITH ITS CURRENT AMENDMENTS THE ONLY HOPE FOR FARMERS AND THE PEOPLE WHO NEED FOOD AND FIBER IS GOVERNOR'S SOME TO VETO THIS BILL. THIS PROBLEM POLICIES PURPOSELY DESIGNED TO GET EVEN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION FOR STRIVING TO BRING COMMONSENSE BACK TO CLEMENT WATER. A SCIENCE. AND IT'S BEEN STATED BY THE AUTHOR AND ALSO ANOTHER MEMBER THAT SPOKE. THAT THIS IS FORTY YEARS OF THIS POLICY IN PROTECTION IS BEEN IN PLACE FOR FORTY YEARS BUT THERE'S NEW SCIENCE OUT THERE THAT'S AVAILABLE. AND THAT'S WHY THESE DECISIONS WERE MADE. SB ONE WITH THESE AMENDMENTS FREEZES ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE REGARDING HOW BEST PRODUCED A REBOUND OF AN ENDANGERED SPECIES AND NON INDIGENOUS FISH. IN THE DELTA BAY AREA IGNORES AT LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS WORTH OF NEW SCIENCE AND DATA. THE SCIENCE WILL BE MADE PERMANENT WITH THIS BE ONE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. FOR THE SINGLE FISH SB ONE WITH THE AMENDMENTS. WILL CONTINUE TO PRACTICE PREVENTING FRESH WATER FROM BEING CAPTURED AND STORED FOR MANY FAMILIES AND FARMERS. BEFORE IT FLOWS INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN. DURING THE LAST DROUGHT IT LED TO ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND COMING OUT OF PRODUCTION. IN TWENTY 5% OF MANDATORY WATER RUSHING FOR FAMILIES. WITH PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND MY COLLEAGUE AND I SERVE. THAT DON'T HAVE RUNNING WATER IN THE PORTER BILIARY AND THEN ALSO THERE'S A TO LEE TRIBE DOWN THERE THEY HAS TO BRING A TRUCK TO WATER INTO THEIR- THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVE BECAUSE WATER SHUT OFF. ADDITIONAL CUTS TO THE WATER SUPPLY IN INCREASE WATER WEIGHTS WILL CONTINUE. TO RISE. SB ONE WITH THE AMENDMENTS PREVENT SURFACE WATER DELIVERIES NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER. MANAGEMENT ACT WHICH WAS PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH MANDATES WATER EXTRACTED TO THE PUMPING. MUST BE REPLACED WITH AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF RAINFALL. A AND IT WITH AN EQUAL AMOUNT AND RAINFALL IS NOT ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE THIS. AND IT'S ESTIMATED WAS CIGNA ALONE THAT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND WILL GO OUT OF PRODUCTION. I SUBMIT TO MY COLLEAGUES AT THIS IS FARM LAND. THAT PRODUCES THE FOOD THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS EAT. AN. THE AMERICAN FOOD SUPPLY AS A LOSS ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT IN JOB LOSS WILL BE STAGGERING ESPECIALLY FOR CENTRAL VALLEY SB ONE WITH THE AMENDMENTS I STILL BELIEVE REX VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WERE INITIATED TO COMPLY WITH 40% OF THEM PAIRED FLOWS AND PLANNED APPROVED A PLAN THAT WAS APPROVED IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT ALONE IS ESTIMATED TO TAKE TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND ACRES OF FARM LAND OUT OF PRODUCTION THE ECONOMIC IMPLACABLE ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND THAT FARM LAND GOING OUT OF PRODUCTION WILL AFFECT OUR SCHOOLS. ARE TAX REVENUE FOR FIRES ARE FIRE CHIEFS ARE POLICE CHIEFS BECAUSE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE LAND IN PRODUCTION FOR FOOD TO GROW FOOD THERE'S NOT REVENUE TO PAY TAXES TO SUPPORT THAT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT FROM MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD ALMOST TWO POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE WILL A CASE ESTIMATED THAT THESE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES COULD BE DEVASTATED FROM MERCED TEMP TO BAKERSFIELD AND IN FACT ALMOST TWO MILLION PEOPLE FROM SAN FRAN IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA WILL ALSO LOSE. WATER IN C. DRACONIAN WATER REDUCTIONS. SB ONE IN THESE AMENDMENTS TAKES AFFECTS IMMEDIATELY ANY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL THE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HE LEAVES OFFICE AND IT GIVES CALIFORNIA'S SO CONTROLLER THE VAST AMOUNTS OF WATER PREVENTS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. INTERVENTION INTERVENTION ASSISTANCE IN RESTORING BALANCE FOR BENEFICIAL WATER USE FOR ALL USERS. THIS IS REALLY. YOU KNOW THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS. WE PRODUCE THE ENERGY THAT THE CALIFORNIANS IN CONSTITUENTS CONSTITUENTS USE ON A DAILY BASIS. AND WE PRODUCE THE FOOD. THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS EAT AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO IMPORT MORE ORAL BECAUSE OF BILLS WERE PASSED EARLIER THIS WEEK AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO IMPORT MORE FOOD IF THIS BILL PASSES. READING THE ANALYSIS IT JUST CAME OFF THE FLOOR WITH THE AMENDMENTS THERE'S A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT ALLOWS A PRIVATE RIGHT ACTION AGAINST INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES THAT ALLEGEDLY CZ EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY THE OR BE. THE COST ANTICIPATD FOR THIS PARTICULAR FEE INCREASES BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THREE MILLION ANNUALLY. THERE IS ANTICIPATING A SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR IN SPECIAL FUNDS ONE GOING COSTS ARE ESTIMATED POTENTIALLY FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IS ESTIMATED SIX MILLION FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND IMPLEMENTATION AND ELEVEN MILLION TO ON GOING COST. THEIR RESOURCES BOARD ANOTHER STATE AGENCIES VESTED MEDIAN ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PLUS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE AIR POLLUTION FUND THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD SAYS IT'S ANTICIPATING THE FISCAL IMPACT ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS A SPREAD ACROSS VARIOUS SENDING FUNDING SOURCES. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S IT'S LIKELY TO COST NEARLY THREE OR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS A D. R. SAYS IT'S. ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN RANGE. IT'S A HAS X. SIGNIFICANT FISCAL IMPACT ON OUR STATE BUT IT HAS A BIGGER IMPACT. ON YOUR FOOD SUPPLY. AND SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTERS ACTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M I'M NOT SURE WOULD BILLS THE MINORITY LEADERS REFERRING TO BUT BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND WHAT THE AMENDMENTS TO. IS IT SAYS IT REQUIRES THE STATE TO ADOPT TO BE REGULATION. ANY FEDERAL AIR STANDARD THAT IS WEAKENED. SO WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW THE HIGHEST LAWS THAT ALREADY EXIST WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT. BECAUSE WE KNOW THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE A POINT TO TRY TO UNDERMINE EVERY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IN THE STATE. I AM TALKING TO THE ISSUE AND THE ISSUE WAS THE AMENDMENTS. WHAT'S MORE BACK IN DC ON YOU GUYS. IT IS VERY WE KINDA LIKE. WE WOULD YOU HAVEN'T BEEN RECOGNIZE FIRST AND WE ASKED FOR DECORUM AND WE ASK NOT DIRECTED TAX ON EACH OTHER SO VISIT. STATE YOUR POINT OF ORDER. IS BEING IN THE NATION. TO MAINTAIN THE HIGHER FEDERAL AIR STANDARDS. THAT EXIST NOW IF THEY ARE WEAKENED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS PART OF THIS BILL SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF THOSE WHO. ARE TALKING ABOUT SB ONE WOULD TALK ABOUT SB ONE AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE AMENDMENT IT SAYS WE WILL THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND OTHERS WILL ADOPT VARIOUS PROTECTIONS THAT WERE IN PLACE IN FEDERAL LAW OR REGULATION AS OF JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN IF THEY ARE SUBSEQUENTLY WE CAN TO OR REPEALED IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE A BASELINE. WE DO NOT WANT TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ERODED BELOW THOSE BASS LINES WHETHER IT'S STATE LAW OR WHETHER IT'S FEDERAL LAW THAT WE HAVE BEEN USING THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT THAT'S WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE ABOUT AND IF I COULD REFER YOU. TO THE SECTION REGARDING A THE AMENDMENT TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IT DOESN'T CREATE A NEW ONE EACH ASSEMBLY SAYS THAT THE PROVIDES A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO ENFORCE CERTAIN ERROR WATER STANDARDS WITHIN CALIFORNIA IF THE EXISTING PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WITHIN FEDERAL LAW OR REGULATION IS WEAKENED TO OR REPEALED BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON IN WASHINGTON WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR LAWS WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR STATE THESE NOTIONS. THAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO COME TO AN END OUR FOOD SUPPLY IS GOING TO COME TO AN END IS TRUST FALLS. THIS BILL SAYS WE WANT TO PROTECT THE STANDARDS THAT ARE IN EXISTENCE AS OF JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN BEFORE THIS ADMINISTRATION CAME IN AND STARTED UNDERMINING AND WEAKENING THOSE REGULATIONS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES THIS IS TOTALLY ON POINT BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE REDUCTION IN THE WEAKENING QUE TO FIGHT YOUR POINT OF ORDER SENATOR. OKAY OKAY ALL OVER THE STATE. WATER BASED ON WHAT YOU GUYS. THANK YOU. WERE YOU STILL STE CONTINUES SPEAK TO THE MEMBER SENATOR JACKSON THANK YOU I AM SPEAKING TO THE AMENDMENTS AT LEAST AS THEY EXIST HERE AND IT PROVIDES ANY STATE REGULATION THAT'S ADOPTED TO ENSURE PROTECTIONS OF FEDERAL LAW SO OF JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILL SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE ARE PROTECT TRYING TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OF THE STATE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES THAT'S WHAT THESE AMENDMENTS DO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR DOING THIS WE HAVE SPENT DECADES TRYING TO CREATE STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS TO ADVANCE TO PROTECT THE FUTURE OF OUR GREAT STATE WE DO NOT WANT THEM UNDEMIND. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IN AND ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THE POINT OF ORDER. BASICALLY CONFIRMED IN MY MIND THAT THE OPPOSITION DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT SO. I WAS GOING TO GET UP AND CAL CLARIFY BUT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA DID A GREAT JOB BASICALLY. EXPLAINING WHAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY DOES AND WE TALK ABOUT SCIENCE COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW I'M SORRY. THE SCIENCE IT HAD NOTHING COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON IS BASED O SCIENCE RIGHT NOW. AND WHAT THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS UNDERMINING OUR ABILITY. TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE. THE DEAL WAS SALT WATER INTRUSION THAT SEAL WITH THAT DEAL WITH THE PROTECTION OF ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT DEAL WITH OF SUBSIDENCE IT'S ALSO AFFECT THE IN. THE PRODUCTION OF CROPS IN OUR STATE. SUBSIDENCE WE VOTER ON A BILL THAT'S FUNDING THE FRYING CANAL THAT IS BEEN AFFECTED BY SUBSIDENCE WE TALK ABOUT. THE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR SURVIVAL OF SALT WATER INTRUSION OVERTAKES. OUR WATER SUPPLY IN THE ENTIRE VALLEY THERE GOES ALL OF AGRICULTURE. EVERYTHING IS DESTROYED THIS ALSO IS AN ISSUE THAT DEALS WITH OUR ECONOMY AND OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE. OF FOOD IN THE STATE SO. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL AND I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON THIS ISSUE CREATING THE BASELINE THIS BILL. WILL NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IT WILL NOT BUT OF. IT WILL NOT. DESTROY OUR STATE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE FOOD BUT IT WILL. PROVIDE THOSE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS MAINTAIN THEM IN PLACE THE ONE SET OF WE WANT WE'VE WORKED FOR. FOR DECADES TO PUT IN PLACE TO PUT OUR STATE ON A BETTER PATH AND WE ARE THE LARGEST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCER IN THE COUNTRIES WE- THINGS ARE GOING WELL WAR WAR GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SCIENCE TELLS US THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL WE GOTTA DO OUR PART THIS ADMINISTRATION'S TERM DEBT THOUGH THAT BUT WHAT WE UNDERSTAND A IN OUR COMMUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR SURVIVAL HERE SUPPORT THIS BILL THIS IS A GOOD BILL. THIS BILL SUPPORTS EVERY ASPECT OF OUR ECONOMY OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR QUALITY OF LIFE PLEASE VOTE YES. TO SENATOR MINING. YOUR PRESIDENT I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT I WANT TO THANK THE PRO TEM FOR HER COURAGE AND LEADERSHIP BRINGING THIS FORWARD A LOT OF THE FOCUS ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE VOTING ON HAS BEEN ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS THAT WERE TRYING TO PROTECT. THEY DO HAVE SOME AFFECT POTENTIALLY ON WATER ISSUES BUT I JUST WANT TO FOCUS. THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE. DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE ON THE WORK FORCE THAT CULTIVATES AND HARVEST THE CROP. IN THIS BILL ALSO SEEKS TO AUTHORIZE THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS BOARD IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO ADOPT VIA REGULATION ANY WORKER PROTECTIONS THAT WERE IN PLACE IN FEDERAL LAW OR REGULATION AS OF JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WERE SUBSEQUENTLY WEAKENED OR REPEALED. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY THE PROTECTION OF WORKER PROTECTION STANDARDS ARE ALSO AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS BILL AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. JEAN HEARING ON MADAM PRO TEM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I WOULD. YOU KNOW THE WHOLE INTENT IN POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT US AGAINST ROLL BACKS THAT ARE OCCURRING. ON CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER ENDANGERED SPECIES WORKER PROTECTIONS. SOME OF THE STATEMENTS ARE I THINK A LITTLE BIT OVER BROAD OUR STATE I'M I'M GONNA MAKE A FEW POINTS JUST TO. RESPOND TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS HOPEFULLY. IT BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A LARGE BILL AND WE TOOK SO MANY AMENDMENTS. OUR STATE HAS LIVED AND THRIVED UNDER THE CURRENT ESA LIMITS THE ONLY THING THIS BILL AFFECTS AGAIN IS ROLL BACKS NO NEW REGULATIONS NO HOLD SCIENCE. AS IT RELATES TO THE ESSAY NOTHING PRECLUDES NEW SCIENCE FROM BEING USED WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT CALIFORNIA WILL REVIEW THE SCIENCE AND JUST NOT TRUST THAT THE SCIENCE COMING. OUT OF THE FED'S THE FED FEDERAL MINISTRATIONS TRUE AND THAT'S WHY THE FINAL DISCRETION REST WITH FISH AND GAME. I WOULD POINT OUT. THE AT FIVE IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. THE PROVISIONS WERE TALKING TO THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE OVERARCHING PURPOSE OF THE BILL PARTICULARLY IN RESPONSE TO RECENT. THE RECENT ACTIONS I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO SAY IT OUT OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. IS TO SIDELINE FEDERAL SCIENTISTS AND WEAKENED PROTECTIONS FOR SEVERAL SPECIES WE SAW THAT THERE WAS THESE THE NEW REGULATIONS WERE COMING OUT THEY WERE OVER WRITTEN BY THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. TO GET NEW REGULATIONS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE REGULATIONS WERE COMING FROM THE SCIENTIST. THE FIRST PLACE SO THEY WERE OVER WRITTEN BY THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THAT IS ABSOLUTE EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS AN ATTEMPT TO ACTUALLY OVERRIDE THE BEST SCIENCE. PEOPLE KEEP ASKING ME OF OUR TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL AS IF WE ARE TRYING NOT TO ACCEPT THE NEWEST. AND MOST UPDATED SCIENCE WE JUST SAW EVIDENCE OF EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OUT OF. WASHINGTON. THE BILL TOTALLY PRESERVES FULL DISCRETION FOR OUR STATE AGENCIES TO ASSESS AND APPLY THE MOST CURRENT SCIENCE AVAILABLE WE PUT IT IN THE BILL IT'S THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IT DOES NOT IN ANY MANNER LOCK IN OLD SCIENCE. REFERENCES TO RUSHING A BILL THIS BILL HAS BEEN HEARD IN AN UNPRECEDENTED SIX POLICY COMMITTEES THREE IN A EACH HOUSE IT'S BEEN REVIEWED. EXTENSIVELY AND WHEN YOU SAY STICK TO THE AMENDMENTS THERE BEEN SEVENTY FIVE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. IN REFERENCE TO THE LETTERS YOU KNOW THERE BEEN MORE LETTERS FROM HI CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS TO ACTUALLY ONE IN SUPPORT. THE BILL OF THE BILL AND ONE THAT ASK FOR AMENDMENTS WE'VE MADE AS I SAID AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED IN ONE LETTER BUT WE STAYED FAITHFUL TO THE SUPPORT EXPRESSED BY THE OTHER. SB ONE DOESN'T IN ANY MANNER AFFECT THE STANDARDS THAT APPLY TO THE WATER SYSTEM. IN CALIFORNIA UNLESS AGAIN THEIR ROLLED BACK THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. OUR SYSTEM HAS WORKED WELL FOR DECADES SB ONE ISN'T THE PROBLEM I THINK IT'S THE IMPACT AND ATTACK. ON THE FORTY YEARS WORTH OF WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE WITH STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH AGENCIES PROCESS. THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT AND I WOULDN'T. I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF ADMIRATION AND RESPECT FOR PEOPLE IN THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY WHICH IS WHY WE MET A NUMBER OF TIMES AND FOR MANY OF THESE. AMENDMENTS COME FROM. IT PAINS ME THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO COME TO AGREEMENT. PERSONALLY ARE BUT THIS IS THE CRUX OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING. FOR DECADES. WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WILL BE IMPACTED WHEN WE HAD THE LAST DROUGHT WE ALMOST LOST THE ENTIRE SALMON POPULATION IN PARTS OF OUR STATE. BECAUSE WE NEEDED THAT PROTECTION IN PLACE WE NEEDED THE ENDANGERED SPECIES WE HAVE A YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE LITTLE FISH THE SMELL. WERE TALKING STEEL HEAD TROUT WERE TALKIN SALMON WERE TALKING RESIDENT KILLER WHALES. BOB WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DELTA ECOSYSTEM. I GET THE DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION I UNDERSTAND HOW HARD THIS IS WE ARE ASKING FRANKLY NOT TO HAVE A RUSH IN JUDGMENT ON CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER. WORKER PROTECTIONS THE ENDANGERED SPECIES OR ASKING NOT TO HAVE A RUSH TO JUDGMENT AND REDO IN SIX MONTHS NINE MONTHS ONE YEAR ALL OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE FOR DECADES. AS CALIFORNIANS AND IN FACT WORKING WITH FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS SO. I APPRECIATE THE DEPTH OF FEELING HERE AND I GOTTA TELL YEAH I'E NEVER FELT MORE CONFLICTED IN TERMS OF ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT FEEL FEEL INTIMATELY THE IMPACT OF WHAT THIS LEGISLATION IS DOING BUT FRANKLY IT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS THE DESIRE TO TRY TO ROLL BACK COMPONENTS OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT BECAUSE. ARE THERE IS SOMETHING YOU THAT MANY WOULD LIKE TO SEE ON DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS. I DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE TO ADDRESS EVERY CONCERN. IN GOOD FAITH I SAID I WOULD WE WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD AND- I WOULD AT THIS VERY EARLY HOUR IN THE MORNING ON THE FOURTEENTH. IT'SAFTER MIDNIGHT WE'RE NO LONGER ON THE THIRTEENTH THAT MIGHT BE GOOD GIVEN THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED ALL DAY AND INTO THE EVENING. BUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB ONE WE SHOULD BE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES AND WE MAY NOT ALWAYS AGREE BUT THERE HAS BEEN A PROCESS. AND EXTENSIVE PROCESS ON EACH OF THESE AREAS. AND THIS BILL REFLECTS. JUST THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THAT WORK HAT WE HAVE DONE I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.
