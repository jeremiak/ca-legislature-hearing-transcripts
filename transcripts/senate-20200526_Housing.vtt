00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:37.722
OF A EVEN MORE EXTREME CRISIS.

00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:42.427
WITH PROVIDING HOUSING. DUE TO

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:46.331
THE VIRUS DUE TO. THE ECONOMICS

THAT. THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE

00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:18.329
BE IGNORED BY THE LEGISLATURE.

00:28:18.396 --> 00:28:22.333
SO I THINK THE SENATE HAS

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.439
ALWAYS BEEN STRONGLY SUPPORT OF.

00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:30.241

IS THE REASON THAT THIS EVEN IS

00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:51.963
IN THE BILL IS BECAUSE WE SIR

IS IN THIS IN THIS BILL BUT-

00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:17.588

01:40:59.787 --> 01:41:03.290
LEARNING- THE CALIFORNIA

01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:04.792
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

ALREADY TRACKS OVERCROWDING AND

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:09.396
WE CAN USE THAT DATA TO ENSURE

01:41:09.463 --> 01:41:11.098
THAT HOUSING THE BUILD IS BUILT

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:13.600
IN AREAS WITH SUFFICIENT SPACE.

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.035
AS I MENTIONED JUST TO

01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:16.670
NEIGHBORHOODS IN MY DISTRICT

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:17.838

TO FIVE PERCENT. AND BEL AIR

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:38.625
WITH 0% SO THERE ARE. THE

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:40.961
BIGGEST CONCERN IS THOSE AREAS

01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:43.163
THAT ARE OVERCROWDED AND THE

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:43.730
IMPACT THAT IT WILL HAVE ON

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:47.935
THEM. THE SECOND ONE IS- THAT

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:50.404
AS WE STREAMLINED HOUSING

01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:53.407
UNITS. I AM. THAT WE MAKE SURE

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:55.709
THAT IS NOT GOING TO CREATE A

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:58.111
SHORT TERM RENTALS OR HAVE

BECOME AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW

01:42:05.018 --> 01:42:07.621
SHORT TERM RENTAL UNITS THAT'S

01:42:07.688 --> 01:42:09.323
NOT THE KIND OF HOUSING THAT WE

01:42:09.389 --> 01:42:12.493

THESE MAPS THAT YOU WE

01:42:47.127 --> 01:42:48.161

THE TRANSIT RICH AREAS AND THE

01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:53.133
JOBS RICH AREAS WHY THOSE ARE

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.702
NOT WITH THE AGENCY THAT DEALS

01:42:55.769 --> 01:42:58.038

MISTER VICE CHAIR OF THE AUTHOR

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.550
COULD ANSWER. SENATOR WIENER

01:43:09.616 --> 01:43:13.587
PLAYTIME SO ON THE BIG PICTURE-

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:16.857
EIGHT CITY IS UNDERSTAFFED.

01:43:16.924 --> 01:43:18.191
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH A MAJOR

01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:19.593
MANAGEMENT TRANSITION THE

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:22.629
DIRECTOR RULES BEACON METCALF

01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:24.464
FOR FISHING SIX MONTHS NOW BEEN

01:43:24.531 --> 01:43:27.701
FILLED- AND I THINK ANYONE WHO

01:43:27.768 --> 01:43:29.703
WORKS IN THE HOUSING

01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:31.638
CONSTRUCTION ADVOCACY WORLD.

01:43:31.705 --> 01:43:33.307
KNOWS THAT ISSUE THE NEEDS

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:36.343
SUPPORT MY VIEW IS WE NEED TO

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:38.979
MAKE SURE WERE BOLSTERING THE

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:39.580
AGENCIES THAT ARE CONTRARY TO

01:43:39.646 --> 01:43:41.248
WHAT. JOB BUT GREAT PEOPLE

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:42.516

01:43:42.583 --> 01:43:43.650
THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE KNOW

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:47.588
TOO MANY VACANCIES. SO I ALSO

01:43:47.654 --> 01:43:48.989
OF THE VIEW THAT WE SHOULD HAVE

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:51.391
A CABINET LEVEL HOUSING AGENCY

01:43:51.458 --> 01:43:52.392

01:43:52.459 --> 01:43:54.061
AND REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE

01:43:54.127 --> 01:43:54.661
GOVERNOR THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:56.797
ISSUE- IN TERMS OF DOING THESE

01:43:56.863 --> 01:43:59.066
MAPS. EIGHT CITY ALREADY

01:43:59.132 --> 01:44:01.702
OVERSEAS MAPPING BECAUSE

01:44:01.768 --> 01:44:02.803
MAPPING HAS TO HAPPEN IN

01:44:02.869 --> 01:44:04.938
VARIOUS RELY HOUSING. PROGRAMS

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:06.173
AROUND WHAT WE CALL HIGH

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:08.875
OPPORTUNITY. AREAS WHICH IS WE

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.410
DO WITH THE SAME AS AS JOB

01:44:10.477 --> 01:44:12.145
RECALL JOB WHICH WAS WAY HIGH

01:44:12.212 --> 01:44:18.085
PATERNITY. SO THEY ALREADY. FOR

01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:19.720
BERKELEY WHO DO THIS MAPPING. I

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:21.822
SAW THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:44:21.888 --> 01:44:22.923
ALREADY THERE TO DO THE

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:25.058
MAPPINGS IT'S NOT DONE IN HOUSE

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:27.194
AT THE CITY VERY THE CONTRACT

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.229

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:30.664
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THIS

01:44:30.731 --> 01:44:33.433
SEAMLESSLY. BUT YOU DO NEED TO

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:34.801
STEP IT UP BECAUSE IT TOO MANY

01:44:34.868 --> 01:44:40.674
VACANCIES. SO I TOTALLY THAT

01:44:40.741 --> 01:44:42.676
THIS IS TOTALLY VOLUNTARILY

01:44:42.743 --> 01:44:44.077
VOLUNTARY FOR ANY CITY THAT

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:45.545
WANTS TO DO IT SO I GET THAT

01:44:45.612 --> 01:44:47.614
PART OF IT BUT WITH THAT SAID

01:44:47.681 --> 01:44:49.683
THIS IS A HUGE SEQUEL EXEMPTION

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:51.151
THEIR CREATION OF A SEQUEL

01:44:51.218 --> 01:44:53.420

TEN UNITS ON A PARCEL IS THERE

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:00.727
ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT

01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:03.296
PROHIBITS SOMEBODY FROM.

THAT MAY HAVE FOR PARCELS ON IT

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:16.777

THE BY MYSELF THERE. THAT'S NOT

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:39.652
THE REST THE RISK IS YOU HAVE

01:52:39.719 --> 01:52:40.820
BECAUSE WE HAVE ENOUGH HEALTH

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:43.089

01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:56.503
REALLY FOR THE CENTURY.

01:52:56.569 --> 01:52:59.038
OVERCROWDING WITHIN HOMES.

01:52:59.105 --> 01:53:00.840
PURSES DENSITIES IS BUILDING

MORE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE. YOU

01:53:03.610 --> 01:53:04.110

THE CURVE IN NINETEEN TO

01:53:28.835 --> 01:53:30.136
COMPARE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BAY

01:53:30.203 --> 01:53:32.071
AREA WHICH HAD EARLIER

01:53:32.138 --> 01:53:34.440
EMERGENCE. TO WHAT HAPPENED IN

01:53:34.507 --> 01:53:36.643
NEW YORK NEW YORK WAS LOW AND

01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:38.311
LATE AT THE CITY LEVEL AND AT

01:53:38.378 --> 01:53:40.380
THE STATE LEVEL. I'M NOT SAYING

01:53:40.446 --> 01:53:41.748

01:53:51.891 --> 01:53:55.929
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH CODE.

01:53:55.995 --> 01:53:57.163
THERE. WAS A LITTLE BIT OF LIKE

01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:59.699
THAT'S THE BLAME IT WASN'T LATE

01:53:59.766 --> 01:54:00.800
RESPONSE IS BECAUSE THE DENSITY

01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:03.436
IN NEW YORK CITY. WELL LET'S

01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:05.305
LOOK AT THAT. THE SECOND DANCE

01:54:05.371 --> 01:54:07.173
THE CITY. OF LARGE CITIES IN

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:09.175
THE US. IS MY OWN CITY OF SAN

01:54:09.242 --> 01:54:12.645
FRANCISCO. HI FOR THOSE WHO

01:54:12.712 --> 01:54:14.013
DON'T KNOW AS OF AT LEAST A DAY

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:17.350
OR TWO AGO THE NUMBER OF DEATHS

01:54:17.417 --> 01:54:19.252

WAS FORTY. NOW FORTY ONE DAY.

01:54:22.422 --> 01:54:23.556
FORTY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF A

01:54:23.623 --> 01:54:25.825
PANDEMIC. NEW YORK JUST

01:54:25.892 --> 01:54:27.060
ANNOUNCED A MAJOR MILESTONE BUT

01:54:27.126 --> 01:54:29.462
IT. WENT UNDER ONE HUNDRED

01:54:29.529 --> 01:54:31.864
DEATHS IN A SINGLE DAY. WE GOT

01:54:31.931 --> 01:54:33.132
FORTY TWO THAT'S FORTY TOO MANY

01:54:33.199 --> 01:54:34.133
DOES OF THE TRAGEDIES FORTY

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:36.069
FAMILIES THAT ARE IMPACTED

01:54:36.135 --> 01:54:38.504
TOGETHER. BUT SAN FRANCISCO THE

01:54:38.571 --> 01:54:40.106
SECOND BENSON CITY IN THE

01:54:40.173 --> 01:54:41.641
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AMONG

01:54:41.708 --> 01:54:43.309
LARGER CITIES. HAS DONE

01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:45.311
REMARKABLY BETTER THAN NEW YORK

01:54:45.378 --> 01:54:49.282
CITY. OR YOU LOOK AT EVEN LOS

01:54:49.349 --> 01:54:50.583
ANGELES WHICH HAS HAD MORE

01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:52.385
PROBLEMS IT'S IN A DIFFERENT

01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:54.420
UNIVERSE THE NEW YORK CITY AND

01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:56.656
THERE ARE PARTS OF LA THAT ARE

01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:58.524
VERY VERY. DENSE WE ALSO LOOK

01:54:58.591 --> 01:54:59.626
AT SOME OF THE DENSEST CITIES

01:54:59.692 --> 01:55:01.861
IN THE WORLD SEOUL SOUTH KOREA

01:55:01.928 --> 01:55:05.732
TAIPEI TAIWAN. HONG KONG TOKYO.

01:55:05.798 --> 01:55:07.634
SOME OF THE DENSEST CITIES ON

01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.202
THE PLANET. THE STRUGGLE TO

01:55:09.269 --> 01:55:10.470
COVER NINETEEN LIKE EVERYONE

01:55:10.536 --> 01:55:12.905
HAS. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

01:55:12.972 --> 01:55:14.574
EFFECTIVELY CONTAIN AT. BECAUSE

01:55:14.641 --> 01:55:16.576
DESPITE THEIR DENSITY DESPITE

01:55:16.643 --> 01:55:18.611
HAVING HUGE TRANSIT SYSTEMS. IT

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:19.479
HAD EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT

01:55:19.545 --> 01:55:23.583
RESPONSE QUICK FRENTE AFFECTED.

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:26.019
SO THAT'S WHAT DRIVES. PROBABLY

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:27.186
NINETEEN LACK OF EFFECTIVE

01:55:27.253 --> 01:55:29.188
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE NOT HOUSING

01:55:29.255 --> 01:55:31.157
DENSITY WE ARE ALSO SEEING

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:33.359
INCREASINGLY LOW DENSITY THAT

01:55:33.426 --> 01:55:35.828
LOW DENSITY AREAS SUBURBS RURAL

01:55:35.895 --> 01:55:38.231
AREAS THAT ARE GETTING VERY

01:55:38.298 --> 01:55:39.999
HARD HAT. WHETHER IT'S NEW

01:55:40.066 --> 01:55:42.635
SHELL THE YORK A SUBURB THAT

01:55:42.702 --> 01:55:44.771
GOT HIT. EVEN BEFORE NEW YORK

01:55:44.837 --> 01:55:47.540
CITY OR OTHER SUBURBS AND RURAL

COST CODES CROWD IS NO

01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:06.025

INCREASE IN DENSITY I JUST

01:57:47.593 --> 01:57:48.594
THINK THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:50.163
KEY NEIGHBORHOODS BUT THAT'S

01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:52.064

SAFETY- WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:58:41.814 --> 01:58:44.550

RENTALS- BECAUSE THIS BILL DOES

01:59:53.352 --> 01:59:55.655
NOT IN ANY WAY LIMIT THE

HAVE FOUND IN THE RESEARCH IS

02:05:12.705 --> 02:05:16.275
THAT LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ALL

02:05:16.342 --> 02:05:16.842

IS. THAT THERE'S BEEN IN

02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:32.224
DISTANCE SEE IN THE ADOPTION OF

02:05:32.291 --> 02:05:34.360

WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE-

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:56.382
STATUTE IS DESIGNED SO THAT IT

02:05:56.448 --> 02:05:59.985

ROLE WITHIN ONE TO TWO PROUD TO

02:06:11.964 --> 02:06:14.433
PROVE IN. SO THIS GREAT TO.

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:17.336
THAT WE REALLY WANT TO

PROJECTS IT'S NOT QUITE PULLING

02:06:23.108 --> 02:06:28.013
OFF WHAT WE HOPED. SO WHAT SB

02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:29.715
TEN EIGHTY FIVE DOES IS CLARIFY

02:06:29.782 --> 02:06:32.017
THAT THE STATE STATUTE AND

02:06:32.084 --> 02:06:33.819
LOCAL LAWS WILL COUNT THE

02:06:33.886 --> 02:06:35.321
NUMBER OF NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE

02:06:35.387 --> 02:06:37.323
UNITS REQUIRED IN THE SAME

02:06:37.389 --> 02:06:42.094
MANNER. IT ALSO- WELL IT IS

02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:44.029
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT WE

02:06:44.096 --> 02:06:46.532
NEED MORE HOUSING FOR LOW IN

02:06:46.598 --> 02:06:48.567
VERY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS.

02:06:48.634 --> 02:06:51.170
THE DENSITY BONUSES ALSO ALLOWS

02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:56.408
FOR THE IN MY OF A MODERATE

02:06:56.475 --> 02:06:59.478
INCOME A AM I OF 8210020% BUT

02:06:59.545 --> 02:07:00.980
WHAT WE FIND IS THAT IN OUR

02:07:01.046 --> 02:07:03.882
VERY HIGH HOUSING COSTS AREAS

02:07:03.949 --> 02:07:05.651
OF CALIFORNIA LIKE THE BAY AREA

02:07:05.718 --> 02:07:08.454
AND THE JOB RICH PARTS OF LA

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:11.156
AND SAN DIEGO THE MIDDLE INCOME

02:07:11.223 --> 02:07:13.459
CAN NOT AFFORD HOUSING IN THE

02:07:13.525 --> 02:07:16.161
DENSITY BONUS NOT RESULTED IN

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:20.065
ANY UNITS FOR THAT SEGMENT. SB

02:07:20.132 --> 02:07:20.833
EIGHTY FIVE DOES PROVIDE AN

02:07:20.899 --> 02:07:22.534
ADJUSTMENT FOR THE HIGH HOUSING

02:07:22.601 --> 02:07:24.203
COST AREAS THAT THEY COULD

02:07:24.269 --> 02:07:26.405
UTILIZE. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

02:07:26.472 --> 02:07:29.041

02:07:29.108 --> 02:07:31.744
82100% OF EIGHTY VERY INCOME.

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:34.680
SO LASTLY THE TEN EIGHTY FIVE

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:38.617
ALSO INCREASES THE UNIT BONUS

02:07:38.684 --> 02:07:43.956
FROM 35240% FOR. EVERYONE BELOW

02:07:44.023 --> 02:07:45.858
50% OF MEDIAN SO LOW IN VERY

02:07:45.924 --> 02:07:50.763
LOW. AND IT- ENCOURAGES THE D.

02:07:50.829 --> 02:07:53.065
B. THE DENSITY BONUS TO BE USED

02:07:53.132 --> 02:07:55.334

UTILIZE AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE

02:08:05.010 --> 02:08:06.211
AND I THINK ALL OF US KNOW THAT

02:08:06.278 --> 02:08:08.947
WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST X.

02:08:09.014 --> 02:08:10.349
NUMBER OF YEARS A VERY

02:08:10.416 --> 02:08:11.784

AFFORDABLE UNITS FINALLY THIS

02:08:29.601 --> 02:08:31.503
BILL CONFORMS THE DENSITY BONUS

THE- I BELIEVE SENATOR DRAWS

02:27:57.401 --> 02:27:59.503
ARE RAISED AROUND. WHO MY BRAIN

02:27:59.570 --> 02:28:02.940
ISN'T WORKING- THE SECOND PART-

02:28:03.007 --> 02:28:04.375
AT THAT IS ONE OF THE MEMBERS

ON TAKING. OKAYSO APOLOGIES

02:28:07.612 --> 02:28:11.482
HEIGHTENS IT NOW IN THE ISSUE

02:28:11.549 --> 02:28:17.388
OF. THIS BILL DOES NOT REDUCE

02:28:17.455 --> 02:28:19.490
THE REQUIREMENT FOR EITHER VERY

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:21.359
LOW INCOME OR LOW INCOME

02:28:21.425 --> 02:28:24.061
AFFORDABLE UNITS WHAT IT DOES

02:28:24.128 --> 02:28:27.064
IS ALLOW FOR IN THE HIGH COST

02:28:27.131 --> 02:28:31.569
AREAS A POTENTIAL EXPANSION OF

02:28:31.636 --> 02:28:32.870
WHAT'S CONSIDERED A MODERATE

02:28:32.937 --> 02:28:35.773
INCOME NOW OBVIOUSLY THERE IS

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:40.011
SOME. DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER

02:28:40.077 --> 02:28:43.147
THAT'S NECESSARY OR NOT- AND

02:28:43.214 --> 02:28:47.485
WHAT. THE REASON IT'S INCLUDED

02:28:47.551 --> 02:28:51.656
IS BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY

02:28:51.722 --> 02:28:55.026
PEOPLE IN THESE HIGH COST AREAS

02:28:55.092 --> 02:28:57.595
WHO CANNOT AFFORD HOUSING. AND

02:28:57.662 --> 02:29:00.531
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THAT

02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:04.068
WHILE WE WHILE WE ADOPTED AND

02:29:04.135 --> 02:29:05.836
DESIGNED TO THIS DENSITY BONUS

02:29:05.903 --> 02:29:08.372
LAW TO TRY FOR THE INTENTION OF

02:29:08.439 --> 02:29:12.043
INCREASING AFFORDABLE UNITS. WE

02:29:12.109 --> 02:29:14.345
HAVE NOT SEEN THAT NUMBER WE'VE

02:29:14.412 --> 02:29:16.113
NOT SEEN THE READ THE NUMBER OF

02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:18.949
UNITS THAT WE HOPED SO IN THE

02:29:19.016 --> 02:29:22.086
REALLY HIGH COST AREAS WE ARE

02:29:22.153 --> 02:29:25.022
SEEING MUCH LESS TAKE UP. OF

02:29:25.089 --> 02:29:26.324
THE PROVISION OF THE REALLY

02:29:26.390 --> 02:29:28.759
AFFORDABLE BECAUSE THE

02:29:28.826 --> 02:29:31.629
ECONOMICS OF THE BUILDING COSTS

02:29:31.696 --> 02:29:33.364
THE PROPERTY COSTS THE LABOR

02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:35.533
COSTS THIS OTHER FEES THAT THE

02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:37.068
LOCAL GOVERNMENT PUT TO ALL

02:29:37.134 --> 02:29:39.036
THOSE THINKS THE WHOLE NUMBER.

02:29:39.103 --> 02:29:41.572
JUST MAKES THE PER UNIT COST SO

02:29:41.639 --> 02:29:43.908
EXPENSIVE THAT THE BUILDERS ARE

02:29:43.974 --> 02:29:46.210
NOT OPTING IN OBVIOUSLY

02:29:46.277 --> 02:29:47.712
BUILDERS IFTHE LOCAL

02:29:47.778 --> 02:29:49.113
GOVERNMENT AS SOON CERTAIN WAY

02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:50.781
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BUILD

02:29:50.848 --> 02:29:53.384
IT'S REALLY ELECTIVE ON THEM AS

02:29:53.451 --> 02:29:54.819
TO WHETHER THEY UTILIZE STUDENT

02:29:54.885 --> 02:29:57.722
THE BILL. SO TURN TO IS

02:29:57.788 --> 02:29:59.156
MOTIVATE THEM TO UTILIZE IT

02:29:59.223 --> 02:30:01.826
MORE AND BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE

02:30:01.892 --> 02:30:10.000
IS THIS. NEAT FOR OUR HOUSE FOR

02:30:10.067 --> 02:30:12.336
EXAMPLE I. THE SOFT SERVICE

02:30:12.403 --> 02:30:14.138
TYPE A WORKER THAT IN A LOT OF

02:30:14.205 --> 02:30:15.406
THEORIES OF OUR STATE JUST

02:30:15.473 --> 02:30:17.708
CANNOT AFFORD HOUSING SO BUT

02:30:17.775 --> 02:30:20.211
THERE'S THIS YOU I AM NOT

02:30:20.277 --> 02:30:23.180
TRYING TO DILUTE THE VERY LOW

02:30:23.247 --> 02:30:26.117
FOR THE LOW INCOME ASPECT AND

02:30:26.183 --> 02:30:28.586
SO IT'S JUST ONE OF THESE. WED

02:30:28.652 --> 02:30:32.123
KNIVES AND DEBATES BEYOND. I

02:30:32.189 --> 02:30:34.058
WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT

02:30:34.125 --> 02:30:35.993
WELL IT'S NOT BEFORE US

02:30:36.060 --> 02:30:37.461
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ IS

02:30:37.528 --> 02:30:39.130
CARRYING A BILL THAT WOULD

02:30:39.196 --> 02:30:40.831
GREATLY INCREASE THE

02:30:40.898 --> 02:30:42.266
REQUIREMENT UNDER THE DENSITY

02:30:42.333 --> 02:30:43.367
BONUS LAW FOR THE VERY

02:30:43.434 --> 02:30:45.102
AFFORDABLE. AND I COMPLETELY

02:30:45.169 --> 02:30:47.104
SUPPORT THOSE PROVISIONS AND I

02:30:47.171 --> 02:30:48.839
WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THOSE

02:30:48.906 --> 02:30:50.941
PROVISIONS BUT I DID NOT WANT

02:30:51.008 --> 02:30:54.145
TO JUST DUPLICATE. HER LAW. AND

02:30:54.211 --> 02:30:56.614
SO I SEE THEM AS VERY MUCH

02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:59.316
COMPLIMENTARY AT SOME POINT WE

02:30:59.383 --> 02:31:02.453
MAY HAVE TO MERGE THEM- BUT I

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:04.121
SEE THEM AS VERY CALM MEANT

02:31:04.188 --> 02:31:05.189
THREE AM VERY MUCH SUPPORTER

02:31:05.256 --> 02:31:07.258
LAW. THERE ARE THINGS IN THE

02:31:07.324 --> 02:31:09.794
BILL IN TEN EIGHTY FIVE THAT

02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:14.098
ARE NOT IN HERS. ONE FOUR X.

02:31:14.165 --> 02:31:15.299
THE ISSUE AROUND. WITH THE

02:31:15.366 --> 02:31:16.867
HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AND

02:31:16.934 --> 02:31:19.203
VARIOUS OTHER THINGS. AND SO

02:31:19.270 --> 02:31:21.739
THAT IS WHY BY CONTINUED WITH

02:31:21.806 --> 02:31:26.110
MY BILL NOW. I AM OPEN AS WE

02:31:26.177 --> 02:31:27.578
MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS TO

02:31:27.645 --> 02:31:29.113
ADDRESS THIS MODERATE INCOME

02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:31.816
THING BECAUSE MY POINT IS NOT

02:31:31.882 --> 02:31:34.485
TO DISCOURAGE OR ELIMINATE THE

02:31:34.552 --> 02:31:36.921
USE OF THE DENSITY BONUS FOR

02:31:36.987 --> 02:31:38.589
VERY AFFORDABLE UNITS IT IS. SO

02:31:38.656 --> 02:31:40.624
WELL. THERE WILL BE AN ONGOING

02:31:40.691 --> 02:31:42.726
CONVERSATION THEIR RELATIONSHIP

02:31:42.793 --> 02:31:44.495
TO THE STUDENT HOUSING. I

02:31:44.562 --> 02:31:46.564
CERTAINLY AM WILLING TO LOOK AT

02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:48.199
HOW WE CAN INCREASE THE VERY

02:31:48.265 --> 02:31:49.967
AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE MY WHOLE

02:31:50.034 --> 02:31:52.403
INTENT OF INCLUDING STUDENT

02:31:52.470 --> 02:31:54.538
HOUSING IN THIS BILL WAS

02:31:54.605 --> 02:31:57.408
BECAUSE OF THE NAME OF THE NEW

02:31:57.475 --> 02:31:59.410
REAL NEAT THAT THE WAR FINDING

02:31:59.477 --> 02:32:01.779
WAS STUDENTS WHERE THEY CAN.

02:32:01.846 --> 02:32:05.349
AFFORD EVEN DORMS SO I

02:32:05.416 --> 02:32:09.420
CERTAINLY- WE CAN RE LOOK AT

02:32:09.487 --> 02:32:10.621
THAT LANGUAGE AND SEE WHAT

02:32:10.688 --> 02:32:12.089
IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE. AND

02:32:12.156 --> 02:32:14.625
THAT TOO SENATOR COVERS POINT.

02:32:14.692 --> 02:32:17.461
HI I THINK ANY AND WE WILL RE

02:32:17.528 --> 02:32:21.532
LOOK AT IT BUT- THE- THE BILL

02:32:21.599 --> 02:32:24.969
AS WRITTEN DOES NOT ELIMINATE

02:32:25.035 --> 02:32:27.605
LOCAL ORDINANCES IT'LL IT THERE

02:32:27.671 --> 02:32:29.940
SOME CONFORMITY FIXES BUT THEY

02:32:30.007 --> 02:32:32.576
CAN STILL ADOPT ORDINANCES THAT

02:32:32.643 --> 02:32:35.513
ARE MORE LIBERAL. SO AGAIN WE

02:32:35.579 --> 02:32:37.348
AND IF YOU IF YOU WANT YOUR

02:32:37.414 --> 02:32:39.617
STAFF OR THE ENTITY THAT RACE

02:32:39.683 --> 02:32:41.752
THAT WE CAN SIT DOWN WITH MY

02:32:41.819 --> 02:32:42.620
STAFF AND GO THROUGH AND MAKE

02:32:42.686 --> 02:32:46.957
SURE. THAT I HAVE- THAT IT IS

02:32:47.024 --> 02:32:52.029
DOING WHAT I INTEND AND IS NOT

02:32:52.096 --> 02:32:53.163
DOING WHAT TIME YOU DESCRIBE

02:32:53.230 --> 02:32:56.967
THAT WOULD. HE FINALLY. ON THE

02:32:57.034 --> 02:32:58.435
ISSUE OF THE CHANGE IN THE

02:32:58.502 --> 02:33:02.673
PARKING. THE YEAH AND THOSE YOU

02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:04.041
KNOW TO ME THAT PART IS

02:33:04.108 --> 02:33:05.776
RELATIVELY MINIMAL ARE NOT

02:33:05.843 --> 02:33:08.913
MINIMAL BUT NOT ESSENTIAL TO

02:33:08.979 --> 02:33:09.947
WHAT I'M TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

02:33:10.014 --> 02:33:11.715
IN THE BILL AND IF IT REALLY

02:33:11.782 --> 02:33:13.217
GIVES PEOPLE A LOT OF HEADACHE

02:33:13.284 --> 02:33:15.753
I COULD LET GO OF IT BUT IT WAS

02:33:15.819 --> 02:33:18.255
ONE OF THOSE WHERE. WORKED MY

02:33:18.322 --> 02:33:20.791
WHOLE PURPOSE IS TO JUST TRY TO

02:33:20.858 --> 02:33:23.761

02:33:23.827 --> 02:33:26.463
THE USE I WANT THE DENSITY

02:33:26.530 --> 02:33:28.432
BONUS LAW TO BE USE SO THAT'S

02:33:28.499 --> 02:33:30.401
THE POINT OF IT AND WE BASED

02:33:30.467 --> 02:33:32.703

INCREASE THE USE OF THE TOOL

02:33:50.521 --> 02:33:52.556
BUT I CERTAINLY WILL RE LOOK AT

THE LANGUAGE IN THE MODERATE

02:33:55.059 --> 02:33:56.894
PART TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS

02:33:56.961 --> 02:33:59.930
NOT. UNDERMINE THE TOOLS USE
