OKAY SO WE NOW MOVE TO ISSUE FIVE OKAY OKAY PLEASE. ISSUE FIVE IS OUR LCAL. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LIAISON IT'S TIED TO SB. SIX THIRTY FIVE YEAH SURE OKAY. A GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MY NAME IS MORRELL FIRST SEE -- SB SIX THIRTY FIVE WAS PASSED LAST YEAR ESTABLISHING LIAISON SERVICES FOR PROMISED SONS AN OPPORTUNITY ZONES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE TWO MAIN ACTIVITIES THAT WERE MANDATED UNDER THIS LAW FIRST -- GO BUSINESS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS AND DIGITAL CONTENT ABOUT LOCATION BASS AND OTHER GEOGRAPHICALLY TARGETED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. AND AND NEXT GO BUSINESS LEVINE A STAKEHOLDER MEETING BOTH OF STATE WIDE -- STAKEHOLDERS FEDERAL STAKEHOLDERS AND LOCAL SO THE WAY THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO OPERATIONALIZE THIS LAW IS BY -- HIRING ONE A STAFF PERSON TO BE TO PROVIDE -- BOTH SERVICES TO LOCAL ENTITIES INCLUDING MUNICIPALITIES CITIES -- CHAMBERS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS WHOMEVER HAS THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THEN ALSO PROVIDING INFORMATION TO INVESTORS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR BUSINESS INVESTMENT SERVICES UNIT -- THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS A PROMISE ON OUR FOR US WE SEE THEM AS OF A TOOL IS A PART OF THE ENTIRETY OF THE GOAL BIZ -- TOOLS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE [inaudible] OKAY -- OKAY WE HAVE FINANCE [inaudible] NO [inaudible] HELLO. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE HAVE A CONCERN. OKAY JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND THEN SENATOR -- IS COULD YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND THE PROMISE OWN OF COURSE SO THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES ARE A FEDERALLY DESIGNATED CENSUS TRACKS. THIS CAME ABOUT THROUGH THE THE TAX. LAW THAT WAS PASSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE STATE'S WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOMINATING THE CENSUS TRACKS AND THE FEDS APPROVED IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE OF THEM. THEY ARE AREAS THAT QUALIFIED A BECAUSE A VERY YES -- THERE IS VERY ISN'T A DEBIT HELLO MEDIAN IN MEDIAN INCOMES ARE PRIMARILY LOW INCOME AND BLIGHTED COMMUNITIES. THE OPPORTUNITIES ON OUR TAX PROGRAM ESSENTIALLY WHERE THERE IS A EITHER A DEFERRAL OF TAX. TAXES ON CAPITAL GAINS A DEDUCTION OR A COMPLETE EXEMPTION OF THOSE TAX GAINES. THE PROMISE ON THEY'RE ACTUALLY VERY DIFFERENT PROGRAM THERE ARE FOUR OF THOSE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEIR LARGE COMMUNITIES. OF I BELIEVE THE COMMUNITIES ARE SAN DIEGO SOUTH LA LOS ANGELES. AND SACRAMENTO AND THESE ARE COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE ARE GROUPS OF NON PROFITS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT COME TOGETHER AND THEY ARE -- THEY ARE OFFERED CERTAIN BENEFITS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- AND INCLUDING -- LIKE -- SORRY -- THEY GET LIKE FIVE AMERICORPS FEDERAL AT LEAST A FEDERAL LIAISON TO GET ACCESS TO FEDERAL PROGRAMS. VERY IS A PREFERENCE POINTS AS FOR FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND FUNDING AND SO IT'S SORT OF A COORDINATED WAY TO HELP BOOST UP COMMUNITIES BUT FROM A MUCH LARGER SCALE. SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS BUT THEY'RE SORT OF AIMED AT THE SAME THING BRINGING UP AND HELPING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LOWER INCOME ARE A BLIGHTED OR DISTRESSED. SO HOW DO YOU SEE THEM WORKING TOGETHER OR THE COORDINATED OR WHAT WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT'S CREATED BY HAVING BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS I THINK THE ESPECIALLY IF. THERE MUST BE SOME AREAS THAT OVERLAP THAT ARE BOTH OPPORTUNITIES OWN AND AMAZON AND THEN THERE'S AREAS THAT ONLY HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER CORRECT SO. MAYBE YOU CAN SEE. EXPLAIN THAT. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- I'M NOT I'M NOT ABLE TO DISCERN WHY THE LEGISLATION WAS WRITTEN AS IT WAS I CERTAINLY THINK THERE'S A CONNECTION OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITIES TO WORK TOGETHER I THINK WHERE THERE ARE PROMISE ZONES AND WHERE THEY'RE POP PROMISE ON THAT OP AND COMMUNITIES ARE ALREADY WORKING. ON UP LIFTING UP OF PROVIDING THE SERVICES. I THINK OP INVESTORS THAT ARE LOOKING -- TO GET THE BENEFITS OF TO THOSE COMMUNITIES SAY OH WOW THERE'S ALREADY DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING HERE THERE MIGHT BE A MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SET UP BASE IN THIS AREA BUT OF COURSE THERE'S A KIND OF ACTIVITY AROUND THE STATE -- VARIOUS COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BUILDING UP FOR EXAMPLE ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- DOES THE STATION AREAS ARE AREAS WHERE INVESTORS MIGHT LOOK AT SO THEY ARE NOT RELATED BUT HEY ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AS THE LAW CALLS IT -- GEOGRAPHICALLY TARGETED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OF WHICH THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL SO AND DO BOTH HAVE THESE TAX DEFERRALS TAX INCENTIVES NO THAT'S ONLY TO THE OPPORTUNITIES OWN PROGRAM. OKAY. SO NOT THE NOT THE PROMISE OF CORRECT. OKAY. OKAY -- ANOTHER -- ONE WITH REGARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES. ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT HOW IT MIGHT FURTHER INCENTIVIZE GENTRIFICATION. DO YOU HAVE ANY [inaudible] FROM. ADVICE ON THAT OR DO YOU HAVE ANY. RESPONSE TO THAT OR IS A WAY TO GET A RESPONSE TO THAT. SITE I CERTAINLY THINK THAT -- THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS COME UP A LOT -- WE ARE EXCITED TO GET THIS STAFF PERSON TO HELP -- REALLY LOOK INTO THOSE ISSUES AND HOW THEY MIGHT BE MITIGATED AND WE THINK THAT THE WAY TO MITIGATE A LOT OF THOSE ISSUES IS TRUTH THROUGH LOCAL PLANNING. AND THAT IS PART OF OUR INTO TO MAKE SURE THAT LOCALS HAVE SUPPORT. IN HOW THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS AND SO UP LOCAL PLANNING LAWS ARE GOING TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE [inaudible] PREVENT GENTRIFICATION BUT OF COURSE THIS IS ALL VERY NEW AND TO BE TOTALLY FAIR THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS ARE ON THIS AREN'T EVEN FINALIZED YET. SO THOSE MAY CHANGE AND AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S COME UP A LOT BOTH WITHIN OUR STATE AND FEDERALLY SO IT'S A FAIR QUESTION. OKAY. SENATORS ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE TOUR NOW THEN OR DO. IN THE MOVIE THEY HAD SET UP CRITERIA. THE NATURE OF THESE [inaudible] DOLLARS. WHAT ARE YOUR CRITERIA HOW YOU OF FORMULATING THAT CRITERIA? CENTER NIELSEN IF I'M UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY -- YOU'RE ASKING HOW WE ARE GOING TO DETERMINE HOW TO STAFF THIS POSITION WE'RE ONLY ASKING FOR ONE STAFF PERSON TO REALLY HELP US. DO THESE TWO MAIN THINGS ONE TO HELP SUPPORT THE LOCALS FOR ANY QUESTIONS THEY HAVE WE MAY DEVELOP TOOL KITS WE READY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE. AND THEN TO TO ENSURE THAT INVESTORS THAT COME TO US AND THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT WHERE THERE MIGHT BE SITES AVAILABLE IN AN OPPORTUNITIES OWN WE CAN DIRECT THEM TO THOSE SITES THROUGH OUR SITE SELECTION SERVICES -- WE HAVE A HUGE NETWORK OF PLANNERS CITY MANAGERS -- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE CAN TAP INTO AND AND SAY HEY WE HAVE AN INVESTOR THAT'S LOOKING TO INVEST IN AN OPPORTUNITY SO DO YOU HAVE SITES AVAILABLE. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR NOW BUT THIS IS AN AREA THAT I THINK BOTH STATEWIDE AND NATIONALLY -- PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT IT IT'S GOING TO BE CHANGING THERE WILL BE LAWS AROUND IT THERE'S A LOT OF BILLS ON IT THIS YEAR SO. MORE TO BE SEEN IN OTHER WORDS IT'S A PROACTIVE NOT HAVE BEEN NINE SLOT. YOU JUST DON'T ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT COME INCOME BUT YOU'RE GOING TO PROVIDE -- FOR FOR INFORMATION OUT. OKAY YES. AND YEAH AND THIS WORK IS REQUIRED BY SB SIX THIRTY FIVE YESCENTER OKAY SO IT'S TO FILL THAT REQUIREMENT. THAT IS. OKAY GREAT. OKAY. QUESTION. NO OKAY -- PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THIS. YOU EXPERTS ON OPPORTUNITIES OLD. OUR PROMISE HOLDS OKAY -- GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- TAKE THE ROLE. SERRA DOURADA YES THERE NIELSEN. CENTER ON BIRTH. AND WE'RE GONNA GO BACK.

OKAY SO GIRLS CLOTHES ON THE OKAY [inaudible] SIX OKAY. OKAY VOTE ON THIS WILL BE THE YES OKAY SO LET'S GO TO ISSUE SIX IN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE PLEASE. THE DESCRIPTION. GREAT. GOOD MORNING MORNING. MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER URBAN NINE THE CHIEF OF BUDGETS AND CONTRACTS WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS THE SCO'S NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS WHICH REPRESENT SCO FUNCTIONS THAT THE CONTROLLER. HAS FOUND ARE IN NEED OF SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO SUPPORT SERVICES PROVIDED TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TAXPAYERS. CURRENTLY THE SCO WAS RESOURCE WITH OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED POSITIONS IN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. 31% OF OUR BUDGET IS SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL FUND. MADE UP OF SPECIAL FUNDS OF WHICH 19% IS THE UNCLAIMED PROPERTY FUND. AS A CENTRAL SERVICE AGENCY THE SCO PROVIDES CORE SERVICES SUCH AS ACCOUNTING AUDITING PAYROLL AND THE DISBURSEMENT OF STATE FUNDS TO STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. WE ALSO MINISTER THE UNCLAIMED PROPERTY PROGRAM WITH THE PRIMARY GOAL TO SAFEGUARD PROPERTY UNTIL ALL CLAIMED BY THE RIGHTFUL OWNER. THE FIRST ITEM BEFORE YOU IS ISSUE SIX SECURE UPGRADE AN ACA REPORTING SYSTEM. THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES RESOURCES FOR TWO PURPOSES. THE FIRST IS RELATED TO UPGRADING AT THE SECURITY SYSTEM SCO LOCATIONS. THIS YEAR MAINTAINED MAINTAINS FIVE SEPARATE PHYSICAL LOCATIONS AND ADMINISTERS THE COMPUTER COORDINATED UNIVERSAL RETRIEVAL ENTRY OR SECURE. SECURITY SYSTEM. AND IT HAS SOFTWARE SUPPORT. THEREFORE AS HE WAS REQUESTING SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN. NINETEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY THOUSAND í SUPPORT THE CURRENT SECURE. SYSTEM TO ENSURE THE CONTINUATION OF PHYSICAL SECURITY IN ALL SCO LOCATION. THE SECOND PURPOSE IS RELATED TO INCREASED WORKLOAD FOR DEVELOPING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR ACA REPORTING SYSTEM. AS HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR REPORTING ACA INFORMATION TO THE STATE OR FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING CORRECTED TEN NINETY FIVE C. DATA RECORDS TO THE IRS AND CORRECTED TEN NINETY FIVE C.. OF PAPER FORMS TO IMPACTED STATE EMPLOYEES. CURRENTLY AS YOUR HAS FOR LIMITED TERM RESOURCES THROUGH. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND NINE PERMANENT POSITIONS DEDICATED TO THIS WORK. EVER AS REPORT EVERY YEAR IRS IS CHANGING THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FORMAT AND DATA FIELDS. ADDITIONALLY ANY ITEMS THAT ARE REJECTED IN THE INITIAL FILING SUCH AS THE SOCIAL SECURITY NOT -- MATCHING THE PERSON BEING IDENTIFIED. A CORRECT A REPORT NEEDS TO BE PREPARED. I REST IS ALSO CHANGING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE RIVER -- CORRECTED REPORTS IN THEREFORE AN ADDITIONAL POSITION IS BEING REQUESTED TO SUPPORT THE UNANTICIPATED PROGRAMMING CHANGES THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR THE ACA REPORTING SYSTEM. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE -- WE HAVE PERMITTED FINANCE. AIR COVER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THIS TIME. THANK YOU ELLERY HELLO. AND ONLY THE LA -- WE HAVE. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. SEPTEMBER -- IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THIS IS BOTH PHYSICAL AS WELL AS CYBER SECURITY IS THAT RIGHT. AND THIS IS REGARDING DIGITAL SECURITY WHICH IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR CYBERSECURITY REQUIREMENTS. OKAY SO IT. THEN. I'M I'M WRONG IT DOESN'T INCLUDE CYBERSECURITY THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. FOR THE QUESTIONS SIR NIELSEN. OKAY PUBLIC COMMENT. VERY NOT THOSE OF THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO APPROVE THIS PROPOSAL AS BUDGET OUR MOTION. OKAY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CENTER DORADO YES CENTER NIELSEN. CENTER OF BURKE [inaudible] GREAT -- ISSUE. SEVEN OKAY. AS HE WAS REQUESTING PERMIT RESOURCES TO CONTINUE PERFORMING AUDITS OF HOLDERS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA UNCLAIMED PROPERTY LOSS. WHICH RESULT IN INCREASED UNCLAIMED PROPERTY TO BE REUNITED WITH ITS RIGHTFUL OWNER. THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO PERFORM AUDITS OF NON COMPLIANT HOLDERS. THE ELEVEN LIMITED TERM POSITIONS IF NOT APPROVED OF THIS REQUEST WILL EXPIRE -- ON JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. SINCE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE SCO HAS BEEN APPROVED CONTINUATION OF THE SAME RESOURCES AS LIMITED TERM. THROUGH THESE AUDITS SCO HAS IDENTIFIED AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF TWO HIGH OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND RECORDABLE PROPERTY. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN THE SAME TIME PERIOD THE AVERAGE COMPLIANCE RATE IS ABOUT 2%. THIS WORK WHAT IS ONGOING AND A PROPERLY SUPPORTED WITH PERMANENT RESOURCES TO ENSURE. HOLDERS CONTINUE TO REPORT AND REMIT. THE RESOURCES WILL ALSO ASSIST HOLDERS AND CREATING UNCLAIMED PROPERTY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING OF PROPERTY IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS OKAY -- LA -- YES BEFORE I GIVE OUR COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL LET ME JUST START WITH A LITTLE BIT OF DESCRIPTION TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE. THIS PROGRAM WORKS. SO CALIFORNIA WROTE LAW REQUIRES BUSINESSES LIKE THINGS ARE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE STATE JEWELERS OFFICE. ABOUT PROPERTY THAT'S CONSIDERED A BAND THEN BY OWNERS. GENERALLY IN THIS CASE MEANS CASH SO LIKE ON CASH CHECKS OR GARMENT BAG -- TAKE TEMPORARY TITLE IN THIS PROPERTY IF NEITHER THE BUSINESS NOR THE STATE IS ABLE TO REUNITE THE PERSON WITH THEIR PROPERTY. AND THEN MAINTAIN AN INDEFINITE LIABILITY TO ONE THEY REUNITE. WITH THEIR PROPERTY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH -- THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IS PROPOSAL SAID WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE AUDIT. THEIR PROPOSE WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT YOU KNOW A COUPLE DOZEN A YEAR OR NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MATCH THE VAST UNDER COMPLIANCE RATE IN THIS AREA RIGHT. SO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ARE LIKELY NOT COMPLYING WITH THAT STOCK. SO TO THAT END WE RELEASED A REPORT LAST WEEK LOOKING INTO JUST A BIGGER PICTURE INCREASED COMPLIANCE. A LOT. WE HAVE -- BUT FORGET THERE. ARE THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY TWO REASONS THAT BUSINESSES TEND TO BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. THE FIRST IS THE BUSINESSES ARE SIMPLY UNAWARE OF THE LAW. AND THEN THE SECOND IS THAT BUSINESSES SOMETIMES ARE WILLFULLY NON COMPLIANT BECAUSE THERE'S A RELATIVELY HIGH INTEREST PENALTY ASSOCIATED WITH A FAILURE TO COMPLY. IT'S 12% PER YEAR FOR PASSED YOU PROPERTY SO IF BUSINESSES HAVE PROPERTY THIS DECADES OLD THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WANT TO REPORT AND GO TO THIS AND WE HAVE. TO THE SUGGESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CREDIT DOCTOR TO MORE BROADLY ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM OF NON COMPLIANCE. THE FIRST ONE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF ON AWARENESS A LOT WOULD BE TO HAVE BUSINESSES REPORT. ANNUALLY FOR TAX FILING STAFF TV THIS WOULDN'T HAVE ANY TAX. PLEASE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE BUSINESSES AWARENESS OF A LOT THE SECOND OUT APPROACH WOULD BE TO PROVIDE A TEMPORARY AMNESTY PERIOD FOR HIS FOR BUSINESSES THAT COME FORWARD AND VOLUNTARILY. ESSENTIALLY TO WAVE AT 12% ANNUAL I DON'T SEE FOR THE PROPERTY. THIS WOULD ON BOTH YOU KNOW PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES TO COME FORTH AND IN THE FOURTH. AND THEN ALSO PREVENT ANYTHING. ANYTHING FUND DO FINANCIAL BURDEN IS ASSOCIATED WITH COMING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW I'M JUST YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE EITHER OF THESE ACTIONS TOGETHER I'M SORRY INDIVIDUALLY BUT THEY WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE IF THEY WERE TAKEN TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY WOULD. ADDRESS BOTH THE PROBLEM ON AWARENESS OF LAW AND ALSO OF WILLFUL NON COMPLIANCE. I'M CLEARLY THE PRIMARY REASON FOR ADOPTING THIS WOULD BE TO REUNITE MORE MONEY MORE MONEY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHTFULLY BELONGS. TO BUT I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME GENERAL FUND BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BECAUSE MONEY THAT IS NOT REUNITED ITH -- WITH ITS RIGHTFUL OWNERS IS -- DOES PROVIDE A GENERAL FUND REVENUE SOURCES SO THAT COULD BE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. JUST A QUESTION ON THAT. DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF OF BY DOING BY IMPLEMENTING BOTH OF THOSE -- BOTH OF THOSE IDEAS. THE RESOURCES THAT IT WOULD TAKE. AND WHAT IT. YOU KNOW WHAT IT REALLY BALANCE OUT WILL WITH IT -- SO -- I CAN'T ANSWER SORT OF SPECIFICALLY. BECAUSE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW EFFECTIVE BOTH OF THESE MARIN CITY BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT SO. THE STATE DID ADOPTED TEMPORARY AMNESTY VERY ONCE IN THE PAST -- IT WAS IN THE EARLY ON THIS PROGRAM SKEWS FOR I THINK. AND THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AT THE TIME ESTIMATED THAT IT BROUGHT IN ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT WAS JUST JUST ON THE ON THE AMNESTY PERIOD NOT ALSO -- DOING THIS MECHANISM OF HAVING THIS REPORT TO FTP SO IT PROBABLY BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE IF IT WAS COUPLE TOGETHER -- IT WOULD REQUIRE SOME IN BOTH OF THESE OPTIONS WOULD REQUIRE SOME RESOURCES BOTH FOR F. T. V. TO YOU KNOW -- ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE TO BUSINESSES AND WORK WITH THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS AND ALSO FOR SCO -- TO RESPOND TO INCREASE CLAIMS TO PROCESS MORE ON AS IT COMES IN BUT IT'S VERY VERY LIKELY THAT THE GENERAL FUND BENEFIT WOULD FAR EXCEED. YOU HAVE ANY. SPONSORED COMMONSENSE YEAH SO FOR THE FIRST ITEM REGARDING THE BUSINESS TAX FORMS ON THE FACE WE AGREE I'M THAT THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA. IT CERTAINLY COULDN'T HURT ON THE COMPLIANCE RATE AND WILL PROBABLY INCREASE AT IT WOULD BE A GOOD COMPANION TO OUR CURRENT OUTRAGE IN COMPLIANCE EFFORTS. HOWEVER WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A WAY TO REJECT THE IMPROVED COMPLIANCE OF THIS YOU KNOW WHAT THIS WOULD I WITH THIS CHANGE WOULD MAKE -- AND THAT BEING SAID THE PROPOSAL WOULD IMPACT LIKE BILLY -- SENT -- ARE THE OF TO BE AND HARD TO TIONAL. RESOURCES FOR BOTH OF US -- IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE -- TO PURSUE THE S. YOU COULD% CONSULT WITH A TV IN THE COMING MONTHS AND REPORT BACK AND MAYBE IN THE FALL -- WHICH WOULD BE WHICH TO COINCIDE WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET CYCLE. GREAT. FINANCE DEPART FINANCE. AND THE PROPOSAL ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUPPORTS THE CONTROLLERS ONGOING EFFORTS TOWARDS ADDRESSING -- HOLDER COMPLIANCE AND WE HAVE NO POSITION ON THE LA US RECOMMENDATION AT THIS TIME. SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY. RESPONSE TO THOSE. WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENT THIS TIME -- OKAY. THE COMPLIANCE RATE HAS BEEN VERY LOW. 2% 2% YEAH SO 98%. OF BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYERS. THERE ARE HOLDING [inaudible] MONEY. RIGHT. ARE NOT REPORTING IT ARE THEY NOT REPORTING IT OR THEY'RE NOT -- MAKING EFFORTS. TO TURN IT OVER TO THE STATE OR TO THE INDIVIDUAL. SO MY NAME IS GERRY CLOSER THAN THE DIVISION CHIEF OF THE UNCLAIMED PROPERTY PROGRAM AND REGARDING THAT -- WE BELIEVE THAT -- AS AS MISTER HOLLAND SAID IN INDICATED DALY OF THAT SOME HOLD HOLDER SIMPLY AREN'T AWARE OF THE LAW AND THE REQUIREMENT. AND THE EQUALLY -- SOME HOLDERS ARE VERY WELL AWARE OF IT AND ARE NOT INTERESTED IN FILING IN COMPLYING -- THE 98% ARE -- BASED ON THE TOTAL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THE REPORTING TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND WE WOULD SUBTRACT OUT OF THAT. HOLDERS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS ARE VERY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE LIKELY NOT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO REPORT SO. THE 98% AS A POTENTIAL SPECTRUM OF HOLDERS THAT WOULD NEED THAT ATTEMPTS LEE COULD BE HOLDEN PROPERTY BUT WE OFTEN DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT TIME. I HAVE HEARD FROM CONSULTANTS AND REPRESENTS THE HOLDERS THAT THEY YOU KNOW ARE NOT REALLY WILLING TO REPORT TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF A 12% INTEREST RATE -- BUT THERE'SHIGHER PENALTIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS WITH TAXES SO THAT'S I WOULD LOOK AT IT AS SOMEONE NOMINAL PENALTY FOR NON COMPLIANCE ESPECIALLY THIS WILLFUL NONCOMPLIANCE. SO DO YOU GO IF WHEN WE DID THIS BEFORE THE AMNESTY. WE DID THIS YEAH I HAVE I WASN'T HERE THE TIME HAVE SOME GENERAL BACKGROUND -- I THINK THAT WAS -- IN 200-020-0012 THOUSAND TWO WAS INTENDED TO BE A ONE YEAR PROGRAM WAS EXTENDED TO TWO YEARS. AND THE NET THAT ARE BROUGHT IN WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS -- THE PROCEEDS -- SO SO WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT INCREASE COMPLIANCE WITH IT GO UP BY. 2% OR TWENTY OUT WE HAVEN'T -- SOMETIMES WHEN THERE'S A MC PROGRAMS -- HOLDERS WILL IF THEY DON'T PARTICIPATE THEN IT ACTUALLY CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY'RE NOT AS INTERESTED IN. COMPLYING AND WAITED FOR THE NEXT ONE INTENTIONALLY SO -- BUT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY PREMATURE FOR US TO WORK WE WOULD BE WILLING TO LOOK INTO THIS IN THE COMING YEAR TO AS AS JENNIFER SAID. TO GET BACK TO ANY OTHER THINGS ON THEM. YEAH AND I LIKE TO SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE AN AMNESTY PROGRAM WOULD GENERATE IMPROVED COMPLIANCE -- BUT WE FEEL THAT IT WOULD BE A ONE TIME COMPLIANCE -- AND BASED ON OUR PAST EXPERIENCE -- AND SO THAT'S WHY THE SCO HAS INSTEAD FOCUSED ON AND ITS OUTREACH -- AND THE AUDIT PRESENCE WITHIN THE HOLDERS -- TO ENSURE THAT WE AT LEAST CAN -- TO ALEX. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WILK. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE HERE THOUGH THAT WE'RE EVER GOING TO ATTAIN MUCH IMPROVEMENT AND COMPLIANCE -- YOU'RE BASING IT SIMPLY ON BETTER INFORMATION BUT IF THEY'RE STILL ALIVE. THE RELUCTANCE BECAUSE THE 12% RATE. HOW ARE WE GONNA GET ILLICIT ANYMORE -- COMPLIANCE. IF THE IF THAT'S A PUNITIVE RATE THEY'RE NOT GONNA WANNA REPORT AND WHAT WHAT WILL CHANGE JUST THAT THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S A PENALTY. THEY DON'T KNOW NOW SEEMS LIKE THEY MUST OR THEY WOULD NOT BE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE 12% RATE. WELL I THINK. THE THREE PART APPROACH ABOUT REACHING COMPLIANCE OF EDUCATION TO THE HOLDERS THAT WE DO IN OR OUT REACHING CLIENTS IN ALONG WITH A LOT IT'S WHICH THIS REQUEST IS FOR TO CONTINUE THAT. TO TO TO EDUCATE THE HOLDERS. OF PARTICIPATION ARE SOME VIABLE THINGS THERE'S ALSO OPPORTUNITIES FOR REQUEST FOR INTEREST. AND WAIVERS FOR REASONABLE BECAUSE KIND OF BUSINESS COULD FEDERATION I BELIEVE WITHIN A ABOUT THAT THAT THAT THAT COULD HELP YES. AND I BELIEVE IN THE LAST YEAR SO JUST A BALLPARK I DON'T HAVE NUMBERS FOR ME BUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INTEREST AND WAVED BECAUSE A REASONABLE CAUSE REQUESTS A FRENCH LEAKS OUT SOMETHING THAT SAYS THAT ALREADY EXIST YES THAT PRESENT REALLY EXHAUSTION STATUTE SO THAT IS. PART OF THIS I MEAN IT'S PART OF WHAT ALREADY. IS AVAILABLE ABSOLUTELY YES. I WOULD ONLY SUGGEST MADAM CHAIR THAT WE HAVE A AN ACCURATE REPORTING OF OF WHAT NUMBERS OF CONTACTS IN. THE RETURNS THAT TO THE THEY GOT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WILLING TO THEN COME FORTH WITH. A COMPLIANCE COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND GET THAT OF OF OF THE FOR FOR A LOT OF YEARS IT'S NOT NOT WORTH IT WORTH THE EFFORT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME. SO WE NEED TO TRACK IT IN OTHER WORDS MAYBE IT'S SMALL BUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF YOU HAVE TO CLICK JESS'S. OF TICKET [inaudible] SMALL -- OKAY THE BILL IS TO SENATOR UMBERG [inaudible] I THINK [inaudible] GOOD. I JUST WANT TO REMIND US ALL BECAUSE I I KEEP FORGETTING THAT THIS IS MONEY. THIS IS MONEY THAT IS BEING HELD THE DOES NOT BELONG. TO THE BUSINESS OR THE IT'S NOT. SOMETHING NEW THIS BEING TACKED ON IT IS MONEY THAT THEY ARE HOLDING THAT WE WANT TO GET TO THE RIGHTFUL OWNER. FOR THE STATE -- SO THIS IS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM JUST YOU DOING SOMETHING WRONG STORY WITH PENALIZING. THIS IS THEY SHOULD BE TURNING THAT MONEY OVER. AND THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT. JUST AS A LOGICAL TO PAY. THIS CHEQUE WAS NOT CACHED FOR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IT DOESN'T BELONG TO ME. HOW DO I GET IT TO IT THE RIGHTFUL? OWNER BECAUSE IT'S NOT MINE. OKAY -- WE HAVE A VOTE ON THIS MOTION. WELL WE CAN HOLD IT OPEN OKAY -- WE WE TOOK A PUBLIC COMMENT OKAY WE'RE GONNA HOLD IT OPEN. ALRIGHT BUT BEFORE WE GET BACK TO THE LEFT THINK ABOUT SOME KIND OF A MECHANISM THAT WE TRACK IT. SPECIFICALLY SO WE CAN KNOW WHAT PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING THAT'S YEAH I WE DO HAVE -- WRIST STAFF STATISTICS ON OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS TO HOLDER SO WE CAN GET THOSE NUMBERS FORTY ON LETTERS AND CALLS AND WORKSHOPS WE DONE WEBINARS AND ONE ON ONE CONSULTATIONS LOTS OFTHAT WITH HOLDERS. GREATLY. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU [inaudible] ISSUE EIGHT OKAY. HIS AROUND OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FOR IBM WE TALK ABOUT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THE PROM PAYMENT ACT I WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS THANK YOU SO THE PROMPT PAYMENT ACT REQUIRES STATE AGENCIES TO PAY VENDORS OR INDIVIDUALS WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS. OF THE RECEIPT OF A VALID INVOICE. SO STATE AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED TO WELL THEY HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO SUBMIT A CLAIM TO THE CONTROLLERS FOR PAYMENT -- ALSO WITHIN THE FORTY FIVE DAYS AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY ARE -- SUBJECT TO THE PENALTIES THAT ARE DEFINED IN THE ACT. AND THEN THE CONTROLLER HAS FIFTEEN DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE CLAIM. TO PAY THAT TO PAY THE CLAIM WITHIN THE SAME FORTY FIVE DAYS OR BE SUBJECT TO PENALTIES THAT ARE DEFINED IN THE ACT. SO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS GOING CAL. AS ANOTHER ENTITY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE APPLICABLE PENALTIES IF THE SYSTEM CAUSES ANY KIND OF PAYMENT DELAYS. SO WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DELAY IN PAYMENT SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PENALTIES OKAY -- WHAT? DOES THE LA -- HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS YOUR COMMENTS. OKAY -- I'M QUESTION. THE CONTROLLER I RECENTLY RECENTLY SAID A SENT A LETTER -- EXPRESSING CONCERNS REGARDING FISCAL IMPLEMENTATION. SO HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO THE CONCERNS. GOOD MORNING SENATORS MY NAME'S GEORGE LOIS I'M THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AT THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. THE CONTROLLERS LETTER. WAS BASICALLY JUST TO RAISE AWARENESS -- AS WITH ANY LARGE COMPLEX I KEEP PROJECT ISSUES COME UP WHEN FUNCTIONALITY IS IMPLEMENTED. AND THESE ISSUES REQUIRE SOME TYPE OF STABILIZATION WORK TO OCCUR IN ORDER TO CORRECT THEM. AND ALL THE CONTROLLER IS AYING HERE IS THAT THE SHE FULLY SUPPORTS THE PROJECT. BUT ONCE STABILIZATION EFFORTS TO TAKE PRIORITY OVER THE SCHEDULE -- IN ORDER TO GET A DIFFERENT PROJECT DOES THAT NOT PRIORITIZING STABILIZATION CREATES RISK. AND RISKS WOULD BE. THE POSSIBILITY OF INACCURATE REPORTING. AND THE LATE PRODUCTION OF AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND HENCE THAT'S WHY SHE SENT A LETTER SHE JUST WANTS MORE AWARENESS OUT THERE THAT SHE EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROJECT SHE WANTS THE PROJECT. TO FOCUS ON STABILIZING EFFORTS. VERSES THE SCHEDULE NOT HAVING TO SCHEDULE BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BUT STABILIZING THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN STABILIZE IN AS FAR AS THE CONTROLLERS CONCERN SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF ISSUES WITH THE SALUTE FUNCTIONALITY THAT WAS RELEASED IN OCTOBER WHICH INCLUDES A LARGE A GOOD PART OF THE CONTROLLERS CONTROL FUNCTIONS -- THERE ARE INTERFACES THAT -- INTERFACE DATA TRANSACTION DATA BETWEEN OUR LEGACY SYSTEM AND FOR SCALE. WHEN IT WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH THE INTERFACES? AND THAT CAUSED A LOT OF TRANSACTIONS TO BE STUCK IN SUSPENSE. AND THE DEPARTMENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO GET THOSE ITEMS OUT OF SUSPENSE SO. WHERE WERE SAYING THAT WHEN WE NEED TO HELP THESE DEPARTMENTS FIGURE THAT OUT AND GET THIS DONE SO THAT THE INFORMATION CAN FLOW INTO OUR LEGACY SYSTEM BECAUSE OUR LEGACY SYSTEM? IS STILL THE BOOK A RECORD IT HAS TO GET INTO OUR LEGACY SYSTEM FOR US TO DO THE REPORTING ACCURATELY. US THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE IS A LOT OF STRUGGLING THERE ARE TRAINING ISSUES THAT I THINK EVERYBODY'S AWARE OF THE DEPARTMENTS NEED SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST EVEN OUR STAFF NEED SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING -- SO THAT IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS AND THEN -- PART RELATED TO THAT IS A DEPARTMENTS ALSO NEED TRAINING AND ALSO KNOWING AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO CLOSE THEIR BOOKS EVERY MONTH AND CLOSE THEIR BOOKS AT THE END OF THE YEAR. SO THEY COULD PROVIDE US WITH THE FINANCIAL DATA WE NED TO PUBLISH THE NOT ONLY THE BUDGETARY LEGAL REPORT BUT ALSO A COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT. WHICH IS AUDITED BY THE STATE HONOR. AND WE FEEL THAT THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT REALLY ARE CRITICAL THAT WE NEED TO TO TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM. AND AND THE TRAINING AT THE DEPARTMENT SO WE CAN GET THAT DONE. UP BECAUSE HAVING LATE PRODUCTION OF AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CONSISTENTLY WILL RAISE SOME QUESTIONS AND IN WITH THE INVESTOR COMMUNITY WE WANT TO AVOID THAT. SO -- DO YOU THINK THE FISCAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THE DELAYS. TO DATE THE RESULT IN PENALTIES I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE HAD ANY PENALTIES WE HAD HAD SOME SYSTEM ISSUES ONCE AGAIN WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE FUNCTIONALITY BACK IN DECEMBER -- THAT CAUSED A LOT OF VOUCHERS THAT WHICH ARE THE CLAIMS THAT. CREATE THE PAYMENT. TO GET STOCK WE COULD HAVEPOTENTIALLY HAD SOME PENALTIES BUT STAFF WORKED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OVERTIME BOTH AT THE DEPARTMENTS AT FIRST GALLON THAT SCO. TO CLEAN UP THAT PROCESS BUT THAT MADE US REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THERE ARE POTENTIAL POSSIBILITIES HERE. THAT WE COULD HAVE LATE PAYMENTS BECAUSE OF NOT ONLY THE DEPARTMENTS ARE JUST AS THE BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM. THE ONE ISSUE IN DECEMBER EVEN THOUGH IT WAS HUGE WE DID. I BELIEVE WE AVERTED THE POSSIBILITY OF PAYMENTS OF PET OF PENALTIES I HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANY PENALTIES. COMING OUT OF THAT BUT THERE WAS THE POTENTIAL [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] COLLEAGUES. AT LAST HEARING I ASKED WHAT THE STATE OF STABILIZATION WAS WITH RESPECT TO THE VARIOUS UNITS. ANY REPORT WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE OF STABILIZATION HOW MANY UNITS ARE STABILIZED. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION BUT I KNOW THAT THE THAT THE FISCAL PROJECT IS WORKING DILIGENTLY TO CREATE A NEW SCHEDULE AND SOME AFFECT WE'RE MEETING WITH THEM. TOMORROW TO DISCUSS THE NEW SCHEDULE AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT STABILIZATION ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE -- FOR BOTH US AND THE DEPARTMENTS I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION YET BUT HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THE DAY TOMORROW HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION OKAY. AN IN HOUSE STABILIZATION IS DEFINED BOTH THE STATUS STABILIZATION AND HOW IT'S THE FOREIGN VIENEN TRYS TO MAKE OKAY YES PLEASE. YOU PUT A LOT OF WEIGHT ON TRAINING WHAT. VISIONS AS CONTROLLERS OFFICE MADE TO ENHANCE YOUR CURRENT TRAINING. THAT'S NOT DISCUSSED HERE SO WHAT WHAT'S THE PLAN TO IMPROVE TRAINING SUCH TRAINING IT IS TWO FOLD THE CONTROLLERS OFF OUR TRAINING FOR OUR STAFF IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY THE TRAINING FOR DEPARTMENT STAFF IS NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND OUR STAFF HAVE NEEDED ADDITIONAL TRAINING IN. UTILIZING FIRST GAL BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A NEW SYSTEM FOR THEM -- BUT I BELIEVE DEPARTMENTS ALSO NEED ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND UTILIZING FISCAL OUT AND I THINK THE DEPARTMENTS. THAT DEAL WITH THE SYSTEM THE SOME DAY IN AND DAY OUT. I NEED SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING BECAUSE THE SYSTEM. IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY'RE USED TO WORKING WORKING ON CAL STARS WHICH MOST DEPARTMENTS WERE -- SOMEBODY WORKING ON CAL STARS FOR TWENTY YEARS AND NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE TELLING THEM THEY HAVE TO USE A PEOPLESOFT PRODUCT WHICH IS WHAT VIZQUEL IS. OUR THERE'S A THERE'S A PROBABLY A HUGE GAP IN KNOWLEDGE AND HOW TO GET FROM CAL STARS TO PEOPLE SO OFTEN THEY NEED QUITE A BIT OF TRAINING. TO TAKE WELL TOGETHER THAT SAID WHAT HOW ARE WE GOING ABOUT DOING THIS IS SOMEONE ASSIGNED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING THE TRAINING REGIMEN AND SCHEDULING THE TRAININGS AND THEN. YOU HAVE STAFF THAT ARE NOW DOING TRAINING AND THEY'RE NOT DOING THEIR NORMAL JOB HOW ARE WE COVERING THEIR WORKLOAD AND THEIR COST AND AND AND ALL THE WORDS IN THERE HAS GOT TO BE A TRAINING. PROTOCOL OR OF A TRAINING PROGRAM DO YOU HAVE THOSE ARE THEY BEING USED AT ALL NOW OR IS THIS SOMETHING BRAND NEW. I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANSWER THAT QUESTION IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT SCO IS INVOLVED TO IN AS FAR AS TRAINING FOR THE DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW TO FINANCE.

IS MOTOR PROGRAM FOR INCREASED ACCESS TO RESPONSIBLE SMALL DOLLAR LOANS. SIX THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TURNED AROUND SO AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MONO SHAKE I'M THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OVER FINANCIAL SERVICES OFFICE. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. OUR FIRST REQUEST IS FOR THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO TWENTY AND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON GOING FOR TWO CORPORATION EXAMINER POSITIONS TO EXAMINE REGISTERED PILOT. PROGRAM FINDERS ONCE EVERY TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE ALMOST TWELVE MILLION SHORT TERM LOANS WERE MADE UNDER CALIFORNIA TO FOR DEPOSIT TRANSACTION Là COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE PAID A LAW. DURING THAT SAME PERIOD APPROX ME A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND LOANS WERE MADE UNDER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FINANCING LAW. THIS DATA SHOW THAT CONSUMERS WERE TAKING OUT MULTIPLE PAYDAY TRANSACTIONS AND TAKING OUT AN AVERAGE OF OVER EIGHT TRANSACTION. IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THIS INFORMATION SUGGESTED A DEMAND FOR SMALL DOLLAR LOANS THERE WERE NOT BEING MET UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FINANCING LAW. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN TO ADDRESS THE CALIFORNIA SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE LOANS LEGISLATORS STAB LIST A PILOT PROGRAM FOR THE PURPOSES OF INCREASING AVAILABILITY FOR CREDIT BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES. TO UNDER BANKED INDIVIDUALS SEEKING LOW DOLLAR VALUE LOANS. CONSUMERS WITH LITTLE TO NO CREDIT HAVE ACCESS TO REASONABLE RATES AND MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AN OPTION OTHERWISE. GRAHAM LENDERS ARE REQUIRED TO OFFER APPLICANTSCREDIT EDUCATION SEMINARS. AND ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BARBERS CREDIT HISTORY TO CREDIT. TO REPORT BARS CREDIT HISTORY TO CREDIT AGENCIES. HOW IT PROGRAM LICENSES ARE REQUIRED TO BE? EXAMINED ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS IN ADDITION PILOT PROGRAM LENDERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO USE FINDERS. COMMISSIONER IS REQUIRED TO POST TO THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE COMPOSITE REPORT ANNUALLY. SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT OCCURRED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN INCLUDE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE FINDERS ACTIVITIES WERE EXPANDED TO ALLOW FINDERS ON BEHALF OF THE PILOT PROGRAM LENDERS TO DISPERSE LOAN PROCEEDS AND TO RECEIVE LOAN PAYMENTS FROM BAR WORSE. ALSO THE PRO PILOT PROGRAM LANDERS COULD PAINT INCREASED COMPENSATION TO FINDERS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE SUNSET DATE OF THE PILOT PROGRAM WAS EXTENDED TO JANUARY FIRST. WHICH IS THE CURRENT SENT JENNIFER'S TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH IS THE CURRENT SUNSET DATE OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AB TWO THIRTY SEVEN WAS PASSED. A TO EXPAND THE PILOT PROGRAM AND MADE CHANGES TO THE DEPARTMENT'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY THE BILL. INCREASE THE PILOT PROGRAMS LICENSING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO INCLUDE SPECIFIC INFORMATION. FOR EACH FIGHTER WHO SERVICES WERE USED. IT INCREASE THE PERMISSIBLE LOAN AMOUNT FROM TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ESTABLISH A DEBT TO INCOME CAP OF 36%. OF THE BARS MONTH COME FOR A LOAN GREATER THAN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IT REQUIRED A PILOT PROGRAM LICENSEES TO PERFORM REASONABLE BACKGROUND CHECKS OF THEIR FINDERS IT REQUIRED THE PILOT PROGRAM LICENSEES TO REDUCE THE INTEREST RATE TO LOANSMADE TO BORROWERS. WHO OBTAIN SUBSEQUENT LOANS AND MET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS? IT ALSO REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO EXAMINE EACH FINDER. USE BY THE PILOT PROGRAM LICENSEES TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. FINDERS ARE NOT LICENSED BY THE STATE AND CANNOT PROVIDE ADVICE OR COUNSELING TO BORROWERS. FINDERS ARE REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED BY THE PILOT. PARTICIPANTS WITH THE D. BO. THEY CAN DISTRIBUTE LANDERS MARKETING MATERIALS PROVIDE FACTUAL INFORMATION ABOUT LOAN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. TEN BORROW SIGNATURES ON DOCUMENTS IN ADDITION THEY CAN DISPERSE LOAN PROCEEDS TO A BAR WORK AND RECEIVE LOAN PAYMENT FROM THE BORROWER. IS IMPORTANT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO EXAMINE FINDERS TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS. THREE EXAMINATION THE DEPARTMENT WILL EXAMINE THE FINDERS BOOKS AND RECORDS TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE. EXAMINATION WILL INCLUDE BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE REVIEW OF APPLICATION LOAN PROCEEDS DISBURSEMENTS TIMING OF PAYMENTS APPLY TO THE BAR WAS ACCOUNT. ADVERTISEMENT OTHER RECORDS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE REGULATORY ISSUES THAT ARISE DURING EXAMINATION HAVE BEEN RESOLVED WITH THE LICENSEES DURING THE COURSE OF EXAMINATION. WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE OKAY. NO I'M TRYING TO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS WHOLE WEB OF SO IT'S THE THE LENDER. HAS A FINDER. RIGHT THAT LOOKS [inaudible] FOR BORROWERS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT BETWEEN WHAT THESE -- THESE FINDERS ARE AND SO A FINDER'S SOMEBODY ARE THERE IT SOUNDS LIKE. THE PROBABLY A TON OF THEM. YEAH THEY HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE YEARS SO FINDERS HAVE TO HAVE A PHYSICAL LOCATION. THEY ARE REQUIRED -- THE PILOT PROGRAM. LENDER IS REQUIRED TO REPORT TO US THE FINDERS SO THEY ARE REGISTERED WITH US BUT THEY ARE NOT LICENSED BY US. AND AND SINCE THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE. OF PILOT BINDERS AND SO. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE IS THIRTY THREE FINDER. MAIN OFFICES AND FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN BRANCHES. IN WHAT YEAR. THIS IS SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OUR PROJECTION -- FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS THE SEVENTY FIVE FINDERS AND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE LOCATIONS. WHO WHO ARE? THE FINDERS SO. THEY'RE LITERALLY BRICK AND MORTAR -- BUSINESS SAYS THAT THE ALLIES THAT THE PILOT PROGRAM LENDERS HAVE -- COMMISSION TO SOLICIT BUSINESS FOR THEM SO THEY CAN ADVERTISE THEY CAN ACCEPT APPLICATIONS THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO CONSULTING OR ADVISING -- THEY ALSO CAN DISTRIBUTE THE PROCEEDS AS WELL S COLLECT PAYMENT FOR THE LOAN. AND THAT WAS INTENDED -- TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THIS SMALL LOANS. I CAN ONLY ASSUME AYE YEAH BUT THAT WAS THE IDEA BEHIND IT CRACKED BECAUSE HE FELT THAT WHAT JUST THE LARGER LOANS WERE BEING GIVEN OUT BUT NOT SMALLER LOAN. SO UNDER THE CFL LOT UNDER. TWENTY FIVE LOANS UNDER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED AND THE INTEREST RATES ARE -- I BELIEVE -- THE INTEREST RATE IS HIGHER -- AND JUST RECENTLY WE'VE EXPANDED THE ACTUAL LOAN AMOUNT TO BE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS. AND UP TO SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED WHAT'S THE INTEREST RATE. IF IT'S AND IT'S A IT'S A SPLIT RATE. AND SO IT'S A VERY BILL LOAN RATE. SO STARTING WITH THE LESSER OF THE PRIME RATE OF THE FOR FOR THE FIRST THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT'S IT'S VERY DETAILED IN THE AND STATURE. AS FAR AS WHAT THE LOAN RATE IS SO IT IT IS NOT IF YOU'RE GOING FROM TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED THE INTEREST RATE GOES DOWN OR UP AND PEOPLE. UNDER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IT'S SO WAS A CAP OF THIRTY SIX I IT'S A SPLIT RATE IT'S A VARIABLE RATE EXISTENCE IT'S A LOT MORE -- IT'S DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN UNLESS I GO THROUGH THE ACTUAL STATUE AND GO THROUGH EVERYTHING. OKAY -- COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS. NO [inaudible] THE NUMBER -- THE QUESTION ABOUT THE THE FINDERS -- DIDN'T DO THE ACTUAL LICENSEES IN THE FINDERS TO THE SPLIT COMMISSIONS THEY SPLIT THE INDUSTRY HOW THE FINDERS COMPENSATED THERE ARE ADMINISTRATION FEES TO SO AND THERE IT'S A NINETY DOLLAR -- IT'S NINETY DOLLARS FOR THE MINISTRATIONS BE. OH SORRY. THAT WAS FOR THE CUSTOMERS HE WANTED TO KNOW. WHAT IT WAS FOR THE PLANE? SO IT ACTUALLY JUST INCREASED SO THE FINDERS CAPPED AT SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS PER LOAN PLUS TWO DOLLARS PER PAYMENT RECEIVED BY THE FINDER. THAT'S WHAT THE PILOT LENDER PAYS THE FINDER. IT IS IS THERE A PENALTY -- IS WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS ARE THE FINDERS -- INCENTIVIZE BEYOND THE STATUTORY RATES. AND IF THEY ARE INCENTIVIZE MISSION. IS A PENALTY. THAT MAKES NO IT'S AUTHORIZED FOR THEM TO HAVE THIS RIGHT NO SO SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THE LENDER SAYS. TO A FINDER I WILL. GIVE YOU IN ADDITION TO THE STATUTORY AMOUNTS PAID I WILL ALSO GIVE YOU. 10% OF ANY LOAN. IF SO. THAT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S NOT AUTHORIZED THE FIRST QUESTION IS IS THAT AUTHORIZED I THINK YOUR ANSWER IS NO THE SECOND IS IF THERE'S A VIOLATION OF THE FINDER IS ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE BEYOND THE STATUTORY FEES. IS THERE A PENALTY I SUPPOSE THE THIRD QUESTION IS OKAY THERE IS A PENALTY WHAT IS THAT PENALTY SO AND THE THE ISSUE WOULD BE WITH A PILOT PROGRAM LENDER AND SO WE WILL HAVE TO REFER THEM TO ENFORCEMENT IF WE DO SEE SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE AND IF. THEY DO NOT CORRECTED THROUGH THE REGULATORY PRACTICE SO DEPEND IS DEPENDING ON HOW EGREGIOUS IT IS AND IF IT'S A REPEAT VIOLATION WILL DETERMINE IF. WE WILL SEND THAT TO ENFORCEMENT AND THEN ON FOR SPENT INTERNEES WILL DETERMINE WHAT IS THE CORRECT PENALTY -- THERE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT -- IN OUR STATUE THERE IS NO SPECIFIC. PENALTY PROVIDE ELATION FOR SOMETHING. I KNOW IN OUR FORSMAN ATTORNEYS KID -- ISSUE PENALTY AND REQUEST -- REQUEST THEM TO REFUND. THE FEES. SET UP TO JUST FEEDBACK ON THAT MY NAME SAID GIL SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER CAN BE I'M SORRY CAN YOU PUSH YOUR THINKING THE FINDERS ARE NOT INCENTIVIZE BY THE RATE IN ANY WAY TO FIND USER INCENTIVIZE BY THE NUMBER OF LOANS THAT THEY PRODUCE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY'RE COMPENSATED. SO IF WE SEE THAT A FINDER'S ACTUALLY INFLUENCE IN A RATE OR PARTICIPATE IN A RATE. INCREASED PER SE THAT FINDERS BEEN REFERRED TO ENFORCEMENT TO CARRY OUT THE ACTIONS THAT MONA JUSTICE JUSTICE JUST SUCK DISCUSS WITH YOU [inaudible] OKAY. IT WOULD SEEM THAT. IF IF A LENDER WANTS TO LEND AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE AS LEGALLY POSSIBLE THE LENDER MAY TRY TO INCENTIVIZE THE FINDERS BY GIVING THEM AN EXTRA. KICKER FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM AND THAT IS A VIOLATION AND IT IS A VIOLATION SO MY QUESTION IS OKAY -- YOU'VE TOLD ME THAT THERE ARE PENALTY THESE ARE ASSUME LOSS OF LICENSE MIGHT BE. ONE OF SO IT IS THAT IF THE PENALTIES BEEN ENFORCED OTHER WORDS ANYBODY. ACTUALLY SUFFERED ANY PENALTY IN LAST TWELVE MONTHS. I KNOW AS I MENTIONED IN MY REASON TATIAN THAT WE HAVE ADDRESSED ALL OF ISSUES FOR VIOLATIONS FOR THE REGULATORY PROCESS SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE LICENSE IN RESOLVING THOSE ISSUES. I'M LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE IT IF AT IT'S AN EGREGIOUS VIOLATION OR IF IT'S A REPEAT VIOLATION THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD REFER TO INFLUENCE ANYBODY LOS OUR LICENSE THE LAND WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET. NO. OKAY AND AND KEEP IN MIND THAT WE HAVE NOT EXAMINED THE FINDERS YEAH. YOU WORK ON LICENSEES AND YOU'LL GET TO THE FINDERS -- WE JUST IN IT AND THROUGH AB TWO THIRTY SEVEN WE ARE REQUIRED TO EXAMINE THE FINDERS EVERY TWO YEARS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE PASSING THE TWO ADDITIONAL STAFF TO DO. TO DO THE EXAMINATION WELL I'M I'M A VOTE I BUT I'M I'M VERY CURIOUS BECAUSE THIS DOES SEEM LIKE AN AREA THAT WOULD BE. RIFE WITH. CHALLENGES FRAUD IF IF THIS QUESTION SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YEAR THE INTEREST RATE IS HIGHER FOR SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS VERSUS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THEN THE LENDER IS GOING TO WANT TO GET AS MANY SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOANS IS POSSIBLE. IN MAY WELL PAY THE FINDERS AN ADDITIONAL. KICKER TO FIND. THOSE WHO WILL BORROW IT A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY SO I I'D BE JUST CURIOUS SO NEXT TIME WE MEET MAYBE. YOU COULD LET ME KNOW SURE. I'M SORRY FINANCE DEPARTMENTS LEO. WE HAVE REASON. OKAY WELL THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING PILOT PROGRAM -- I CAN SEE THAT THE THE LAST OF CHANGES THAT WERE MADE TO IT. I HOPE OUR I THINK OUR AIM THAT SORT OF A DRESS IN OUR OUR CONCERNS HERE RIGHT. THE EXAMINATION OF OF THE FINDERS AND BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THE FINDERS SO. OF I HOPE. THE PILOT PROGRAM WORKS AND DOESN'T BECOME SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S JUST ABUSIVE OF COMMUNITIES OR COMMUNITIES. WHICH ARE THE ONES THAT NEED IT THE MOST GETTING THE MOST ABUSED. OKAY SIR NIELSEN NOT. OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO APPROVE THIS PROPOSAL AS BUDGET IN YOUR MOTION [inaudible] ROLL. IT'S IN OUR DORADO YES CENTER NIELSEN. SOONER AMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY.

WE ARE REQUESTING EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND AND NINETEEN TWENTY AND EIGHT HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND ON GOING. THE FIVE PERMANENT CORPORATION EXAMINER POSITIONS TO CARRY OUT THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENT TO EXAMINE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LENDING ACT LICENSEES. AND CALIFORNIA FINANCING LOT LICENSEES THAT CONDUCT RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES. THESE RESOURCES WILL ENSURE THAT THE SAM ENTERS TO MEET THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LICENSE LANDING Là FORTY EIGHT MONTHS STATUTORY EXAMINATION CYCLE. AND THE CALIFORNIA FINANCING LAWS SIXTY MONTH EXAMINATION CYCLE TO MEET THE CONFERENCE OF STATE BANK SUPERVISORS. ADDITION STANDARDS HERE WITH ME IS VICTOR WELLS DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF MORTGAGE LENDING WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE [inaudible] OKAY PLAINTIFFS. QUESTIONS LA YOU OF COURSE HIS COLLEAGUES. JUST -- ONE QUESTIONS WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF EXAMINATION DO THEY DO. OF THE MORTGAGE LENDERS. BASICALLY THEY'RE DOING COMPLIANCE EXAMS IN THAT ENTAILS THE INDIVIDUALS ARE MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATORS SO THEY HAVE TO BE LICENSE AS WELL SO HERE'S CODES THAT THEY MUST. DO AS WELL AND THEN THERE'S THE COMPANIES WHICH ARE LICENSE EITHER UNDER THE SEA I'M LA LAW OR TO SEE IF BILL LAW. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE RATES THAT THEY'RE OFFERING TO CONSUMERS AND IN ADDITION TO DOING REGULAR. I GUESS MORTGAGE LAWS THEY DO REVERSE MORTGAGES AS WELL WE AS A CASE OF FORECLOSURE ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO TOOL TRACKING WHICH MEANS. WHEN SOMEONE IS REQUESTING TO HAVE THEIR RATE REDUCE YOU CANNOT CONTINUE WITH FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES SO THEY ARE CHECKING THINGS LIKE THAT AS WELL AS OTHER DISCLOSURES TO ENSURE? THAT THE LICENSEES ARE HEARING TO ALL OF THOSE. IN DO THEY LET'S SAY THEY RECEIVE CERTAIN COMPLAINTS THE CONSUMER AFFAIRS OR WHOMEVER RECEIVES COMPLAINTS -- DO THEY ACCELERATE THE PROCESS SAYS HERE EVERY FORTY EIGHT MONTHS OR SO. IT DEPENDS WE GET COMPLAINTS WE HAVE A COMPLAINT -- DEPARTMENT AS WELL TO CONSUMER SERVICES -- UNIT AND THEN IF THOSE COMPLAINTS ARE. SAFE VERY COMPLICATED THEY FORWARDED TO THE PROGRAM WHICH WOULD IN THIS CASE BE MY PROGRAM AND WE WOULD LOOK INTO IT AND IF IT ENTAILS AS GOING OUT. FOR AN EARLIER EXAMINATION WE WOULD DO THAT. BUT MOST OF THE TIME WE CAN RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES BY COUNTY NO ONE AND AGAIN IT WILL BE NOTED AND WE WOULD LOOK INTO THOSE AREAS AGAIN CLOSE CLOSER WE GO BACK OUT. TO DO THE EXAMINATION IF IT'S FORTY EIGHT MONTHS OR TWENTY FOUR WHATEVER THE TIME LINE IS. BERMAN STANDARD SO LET'S JUST PICK REVERSE MORTGAGES WHICH IS AN AREA OF CONCERN -- SO SOMEBODY COMPLAINS ABOUT A REVERSE MORTGAGE IS THEIR PERFORMANCE STANDARD. BY WHICH WE TRIED TO IT HERE IN TERMS OF RESPONDING TO THE COMPLAINT. ANOTHER REASON WE SAY WE TRY TO GET BACK TO WITHIN THIRTY DAYS SIXTY DAYS YEAH THERE'S A STANDARD -- TURN AROUND I BELIEVE THEY SEND OUT LETTERS ONCE THEY RECEIVE IT WITHIN TEN DAYS NOTIFYING THE COMPLAINT AND THAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE COMPLAINT. AND THEN WE ONCE WE CAN NOTIFY THE LICENSEE AGAIN IT'S A TEN DAY TURNAROUND. WE I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE AND WE IF IT'S SOMETHING WHERE THEY'RE COMPLAINING -- SAYS. LOW PERFORMANCE IN THAT KIND OF STUFF. NO WE WOULDN'T GIVE THEM THE END RESULT BUT WE WOULD LOOK INTO WHAT AND HOW TO KIND OF EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. AND SEE BUT IF IT'S REGARDING REFUNDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT OR FRAUD YEAH WE LOOK INTO THOSE AND WE WILL GET. GOALS COMPLAINT IT'S A RESPONSE IF IF TO HUNT BUT WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN IS NOT SO MUCH. YOU KNOW THE END PRODUCT BUT JUST THE PROCESS. MY CONSTITUENTS AND PROBABLY OTHERS IS THAT WHEN THERE'S A COMPLAINT MADE TO A GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY THEY DON'T HEAR BACK OR THEY HEAR BACK WE GOT A COMPLAINT IN THE NUMBER HERE HAPPENS YEAH. MY QUESTION IS IS IS THERE A POLICY A REGULATION THAT SAYS ONCE A COMPLAINT IS RECEIVED HEARD WE SAID WITHIN TEN DAYS THE THE INTERNAL POLICY EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NOTHING. WRITTEN IN THE COLD TO SAY SO I HAVE TO RESPOND IN THIRTY DAYS NO LONGER INTERNAL POLICY OKAY SO WHAT WHAT IS THE INTERNAL POLICY THAT THAT WE WOULD REDUCE WE REPLY WITHIN TEN DAYS OF RECEIVING THE RIGHT. AND THEN IS THERE AN INTERNAL POLICY IS TO WHEN YOU. EITHER INFORM THE COMPLAIN THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S OF UNFOUNDED ALLEGATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO IS THERE ANYTHING TO RESOLVE MY CONCERN. YEAH THEN I'D PEOPLE COMPLAIN. THEY MAY GET A LETTER OF INTENT THEY SAY WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT AND THEN THEY NEVER HEAR AGAIN SO. TYPICALLY WE WOULDN'T NEVER HEAR FROM AGAIN WHAT WILL TYPICALLY WOULD HAPPEN WITHIN TEN DAYS AFTER SENDING THE RESPONSE TO THE COMPLAINT WE WILL DO A SELF EVALUATION INTERNALLY WITH THE LICENSEE AND EVALUATE WHAT THE CLAIM IS ABOUT. IF IT WARRANTS A SPECIAL EXAMINATION. THEN THE D. B. O. IS AUTHORIZED TO GO OUT AND DO IT. THIRTY DAYS TO ONE IN FORTY DAYS SO THERE'S SO DURING THAT PROCESS THE DPO IS ACTUALLY EVALUATING WHAT THE COMPLAINT IS SEEING IF WE CAN SELL IT BETWEEN THE LICENSEE OURSELVES OR THE LICENSEE IN THE COMPLAIN. SO THERE'S REALLY HARD TO GIVE YOU A TIME LINE BUT THERE IS COMMUNICATION THAT TAKES PLACE BETWEEN THE DPO AND ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED. DURING THAT TIME PERIOD SO. THEY'RE NOT LEFT OUT IN THE COLD SAYING HEY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MY COMPLAINT OKAY SO BUT BUT BACK TO MY QUESTION SURE. IS THERE AN INTERNAL POLICY IS THERE AN INTERNAL REGULATIONS -- IS STANDARD AS THEIR STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE. THE THE THE ISSUE I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS THAT WHAT I HEAR IS. ONCE SOMEONE MAKES A COMPLAINT AND I'M NOT SINGLING YOU OUT BUT SINCE YOU'RE HERE AGAIN THIS THE QUESTIONS -- ONCE IS A COMPLAINT MADE. IS THERE SOME BESIDES THE TEN DAY LETTER IS THERE SOME SORT OF POLICY THAT SAYS AT THE END OF THIS INVESTIGATION WHETHER IT TAKES THIRTY DAYS OR TWO OR FORTY DAYS. THAT THERE WILL BE A RESPONSE TO THE COMPLAINT AS TO WHAT THE RESULT IS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE RESULT. OKAY THAT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE IDENTIFIED IN THE INITIAL LETTER STATE THAT ONCE WE RESOLVE THIS CASE YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT TIMELINE SPECIFIED IN HERE. IS THERE A POLICY THAT SAYS WILL RESPOND TO FOLKS AT THE END OF ANY INVESTIGATION. NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF TOP OF MY HEAD AND GUARDIAN BECAUSE IF WE HAVE TO REACH OUT TO THE LICENSEE AND AGAIN WE DO GIVE HIM TIME LINES ON THAT. BUT THEREMAY BE BACK AND FORTH AFTER RECEIVED THAT INITIAL RESPONSE WE HAVE TO GET MORE INFORMATION AND LOOK INTO IT AND AGAIN IF IT TURNS INTO AN EXAMINATION NOW WE HAVE. TO EXAMINATION AND SO THE PROCESS SO TIGHTLY. TO THEIR EVEN APOLLO SOMEONE CONSTITUENTS SAYS TO ME. I'VE MADE A COMPLAINT. AND I NEVER HEARD BACK SHOULD MY RESPONSE BE. I'M SORRY THERE'S NO STATE POLICY TOUGH LUCK OR SHOULD I SAY THERE IS A STATE POLICY THAT SAYS THE END OF THIS EXAMINATION. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GET SOME SORT OF RESPONSE THEY KNOW WHAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET IT IS NOT THE NOT THE PROCESS ITSELF I'M TRYING TO GET AT BEING RESPONSIVE. TO CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE AN ISSUE. IF IT TURNS INTO AN EXAMINATION WE DO HAVE INTERNAL REQUIREMENTS SO YOUR TURN AROUND TIMES ON EXAMINATIONS VICTOR AND IF YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT. IF IT'S NOT AN ACTUAL. EXAMINATION THEN WE HAVE A CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICE AND I THINK JIM CAN. TALK ABOUT. YEAH I'M JIM SWEENEY AND MANAGE A CONSUMER SERVICES OFFICE -- CENTER WE HAVE CLEAR -- AND DEFINE METRICS THAT WE HAD HERE TO FOR THE RECEIPT AND AND AND LUMINARY HANDLING OF OF COMPLAINTS -- FOR COMPLAINTS THAT -- GET THE THAT ARE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT PERHAPS WE HAVE TO HAND OFF TO VICTOR'S PROGRAM OR SOME OTHER PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW IT'S HE CAN'T REALLY. IMPOSE A A AT PRE SET TIMELINE ON THOSE COMPLETE BIG IF YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT MIGHT TAKE A PER. PROCESS A MORE COMPLICATED COMPLAINT THAT.

DOES THAT PERSON IT -- FOR EXAMPLE GET A NOTIFICATION AT THE END OF A EXAMINATION INVESTIGATION. WHATEVER WHATEVER TERM YOU MIGHT USE THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT THIS AND WE HAVE MADE A DETERMINATION THAT THIS IS. FILL IN THE BLANK THE ANSWER'S IN ALL CASES YES ALL RIGHT. IN. A GET THAT THE IT COULD BE THIRTY DAYS IT COULD BE. IN FORTY DAYS SO IN ALL CASES AND THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S AN INTERNAL POLICY IS THAT REGULATION IS THAT BY STATUTE WITH WHAT'S THE I BELIEVE IS AN INTERNAL POLICY -- IT'S IT'S THESE ARE METRICS THAT HAVE BEEN REVIEWED -- BY THE COMMISSIONER AND APPROVED BY THE COMMISSIONER AND THAT WE HEAR TO INTERNALLY -- HE WENT OUT THERE -- EMBEDDED IN POLICY SO PLACE POLICY THAT SAYS. WITH AN EX NUMBER OF DAYS AFTER THE INQUIRY INVESTIGATION EXAMINATION IS COMPLETE. THE COMPLAINT WILL GET A WRITTEN NOTIFICATION.
