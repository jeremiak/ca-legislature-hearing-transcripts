ARE GOING TO CALL THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET -- SUB SIX AND THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION. COMMITTEE TO ORDER COULD WE OUNCE OF THE A GASP IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO PLEASE -- COMPORT. LET ME JUST START OFF WITH -- INTRODUCTORY REMARKS AND JUST THINK MY ARM -- A CO CHAIRMAN MISTER FRAZIER WHO CHAIRS ARE SIMPLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. ALSO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM PRESIDENT MISTER PATTERSON WHO. ARE ALSO HAS RAISED THE ISSUE OF BOTH LOCALLY AND STATEWIDE. HARM COULD KILL MY MOST RECENT EXPERIENCE GOVERNMENT VOEPEL MOTOR VEHICLES WAS A LITTLE BIT SHOCKING BECAUSE I WENT. TO LIKE MANY CALIFORNIANS RENEW MY DRIVER'S LICENSE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO BY LOCAL SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE. AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE ALLOWING GOING AROUND THE BLOCK. AND UNLIKE MOST ROCK CONCERTS WHICH WE HAVE AN OCCASIONAL LINE OF PEOPLE WAITING. TO SEE THEIR FAVORITE SHOW -- I WAS TOLD THAT PEOPLE STE. SAM THE MORNING. TO TAKE CARE OF ORDINARY BUSINESS AND THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING QUITE REGULARLY UNFORTUNATELY -- WE'RE HERE TODAY TO THE RELIEF TAKE OUT. DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS WE APPROPRIATED FOR THE PROMOTED VEHICLES AFFECTED JULY FIRST -- DE UP BELIEF ABOUT ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED POSITIONS THAT WERE ALLOCATED IN THE BUDGET -- HOW THOSE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN -- ALLOCATED THAT THE TIMING OF PA BRINGING THEM ONLINE WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN -- WHERE THEY'VE BEEN PLACED IN DMB OFFICES AROUND THE STATE? AS WELL AS REALLY WHAT THE PLAN IS TO REDUCE THE WAIT TIMES WE'VE BEEN HEARING. UNFORTUNATELY THAT -- RESIT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO ARE GOING IN WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT HAVE WE TIME TO TALK TO SIX SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY. UNACCEPTABLE. AYE. THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT THAT WE NOW HAVE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO BEFORE WOULD JUST RENEW THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSES BY MAIL NOW. CARBON DOING THEM HAVE TO RENEW THEM IN PERSON LIKE MYSELF. AND SO THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY CAUSING A STRAIN WE ALL WE WANT TO KNOW ON AGAIN DID WE ESTIMATE CORRECTLY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAD TO COME FORWARD INTO D. M. V.. AS WELL AS DO WE ESTIMATE THE TRANCE THOUGH TRANSACTION TIME. THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO PROCESS EACH OF THESE ARE APPLICATIONS I KNOW MY DISCUSSION WITH THE DIRECTOR A FEW WEEKS AGO. THEN THAT TECHNOLOGY WAS BEING IMPLEMENTED WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED HASN'T MADE A DIFFERENCE -- IN MY BRIEF DISCUSSION WITH THE CLERK. WHEN I WAS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES THEY ESTIMATED THAT TOOK ABOUT ROUGHLY TWENTY MINUTES AND THIS IS OF COURSE ANECDOTAL TWENTY MINUTES OF TIME THE DATA ENTRY? THAT ON I FIGURED COULD BE DONE WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE WAITING IN LINE TO BE DONE AT A KIOSK THAT COULD BE DEBT BE DONE ONLINE -- BEFORE THEY GOT THERE THEY COULD BE DONE WITH AN AYE. TAKING A CORRECTIVE ACTION TO REALLY -- ADDRESS THAT A PARTICULAR SITUATION [inaudible] ON AND THE LAST THING IS ALSO THE CONCERN THAT RENEWAL NOTICES ARE GOING OUT TOO LATE THAT RENEWAL RENEWAL NOTICES FOR DRIVER'S LICENSES. ARE RECEIVED IN THAT PEOPLE CANNOT GET APPOINTMENTS. FOR THE EXPIRATION OF THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSES I THINK THAT CAN BE FIXED I VERY EASILY BY SENDING OUT RENEWAL NOTICES MUCH FURTHER AND EVENTS. TO RELIEVE THE ANXIETY OF CALIFORNIANS AND GIVE THEM PLENTY OF TIME TO GO OVER NEW THAT LICENSE. ARE LET ME JUST START OFF BY ASKING IF MR FRAZIER HAS ANY OPENING COMMENTS THEN. ALLOWS THE REMAINDER OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS MISTER FRAZIER. I THANK YOU MISTER KING I HAVE FOR JOIN YOU ON MY COMMITTEE FOR THIS HEARING TODAY. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES HAS ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO LOCATIONS ACROSS OUR STATE WITH OVER FOUR THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. IN MANY WAYS THE DMV IS THE FACE OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT. IT IS THE AGENCY THE CALIFORNIA'S MOST OFTEN INTERACT IN SOME WAY. WHETHER IT IS FOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION OBTAINING A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR RENEWING A DRIVER'S LICENSE. BECAUSE OF THIS IT IS IMPORTANT THEBUDGET COMMITTEE PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR DIEM THE DMV SERVICES. AS IT CAN HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE WAY ALL CALIFORNIANS VIEW GOVERNMENT. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT HOURS TO RECEIVE A BASIC GOVERNMENT SERVICE. THE RECENT SPIKE IN WAIT TIMES TO SHOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET HAS NOT PRIORITIZE. THE DMV ANYWAY TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE CUSTOMER SERVICE. PART OF THE PROBLEM LIES IN A FAILURE OF COMMUNICATION AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT CAN BE DONE IN IN OR OUTSIDE OF A D. M. V. OFFICE. WELL ANY CALIFORNIA HAS A CAR HAS TO INTERACT WITH THE MV ON A YEARLY BASIS MOST CALIFORNIANS SHOULD ONLY SEE THE INSIDE OF THE DMV ONCE EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS. TO RENEW THEIR LICENSE IN PERSON. THIS IS BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS DMV AS AN AUTOMATED MANY OF ITS SERVICES BY OFFERING THEM. ONLINE OR OVER IN THE MAIL. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO COME TO INTO THE DMV TO RENEW THEIR VEHICLE REGISTRATION. AND MOST PEOPLE CAN HANDLE TWO OR THREE DRIVERS LICENSE RENEWALS BY MAIL. DMV HAS ESTABLISHED MOBILE CENTERS IN RECENT YEARS CALL D. M. V. NOW. WHICH ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO RENEW THEIR VEHICLE REGISTRATION A KIOSK IN THEIR LOCAL GROCERY STORE IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO DO SO BY MAIL. IN THE RARE OCCASIONS THAT SOMEONE DOES HAVE TO VISIT THE DMV AN APPOINTMENT CAN BE MADE AHEAD OF TIME TO REDUCE WAIT TIMES [inaudible] HOWEVER. DESPITE ALL OF THIS MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE DMV TO HANDLE THESE TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE DONE ELSEWHERE. AND DIEM BE WAIT TIMES HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY LONGER MUCH OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH A CHANGE IN FEDERAL LIES YOUR KNOWLEDGE FEDERAL ID. BUT WE THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ALSO BEEN ABLE. A PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH AB SIXTY AB NINE THIRTY FIVE THESE ARE ALL SOLUTIONS. THAT WE'VE PUT IN LEGISLATION HAS TO CREATE MORE TIME NEEDED FOR DIEM VIEW EMPLOYEES. SO AFTER THE HORRORS OF SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADDED AND CREATED STRICTER STATE ID LAWS WITH THE PAST OF THIS RELATE REAL ID ACT. IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. OF FUNDING. IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE FEDERAL LAWS PASSAGE. EVERY STATE IS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH REAL IDEA TO RESIDENTS WHICH TO FLY DOMESTICALLY. OR ENTRY FEDERAL FACILITY AS A RESULT THE REQUIREMENT OF CALIFORNIANS ONCE EVERY FIFTEEN YOUR DMV VISIT JUST GOT MOVED UP. AND ARE CONSEQUENCES WHAT'S WILL HAVE TO VISIT THE DMV IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO CHANGE OUR LICENSES TO RELY DE. THIS IS LEAD TO CONFUSION AMONGST OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO SPEND MINUTES LONGER THAN WITH DIEM VIEW. EMPLOYEES TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY REALLY NEED -- WITH IT REAL ID COMPLIANCE. THIS IS RESOLVED IN DELAYING THE PROCESS FOR EVERYONE LINED THE DMV. THIS BECOMES A BIGGER HEADACHE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TO GO TO DMV FOR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE LOSING THEIR ID'S HOW ARE HAVING THEIR ID STOLEN. IN ANTICIPATION AWAY THE PEOPLE COMING IN TO TRADE IN THEIR ID'S TO BE REAL IDEA COMPLIANT. D. DMB IS GRANTED FOUR HUNDRED ADDITIONAL STAFF WITH ANOTHER HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO BE ADDED BY AUGUST A SMALL ADDITION FOR THE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO OFFICES STATEWIDE. BECAUSE A DIEM V. IS SO HIGHLY UTILIZE IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WE IS THE LEGISLATURE ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A GOOD EXPERIENCE. THE RISK OF FAILING TO DO SO CAN HAVE NEVER THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON EVERYONE'S OPINIONS ON HOW GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS. THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE NOW. I HOPE TODAY WE CAN LEARN THE DMB NEEDS IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THIS INFLUX OF CUSTOMERS SO THAT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE CAN PRIORITIZE THIS FINAL DEPARTMENT TO RECEIVE THE RESOURCES IT NEEDS. TO KEEP OUR CONSTITUENTS SATISFIED. AND WITH THAT MR TING I THANK YOU FOR CALLING THIS HERE. I THINK IT'S FRAZIER MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. YOU KNOW WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF COMPLEXITY HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE A MUCH SIMPLER VIEW OF THE WAY THAT STATE GOVERNMENT WORKS AND THEIR INTERACTION ON A DAILY BASIS WITH DIFFERENT APARTMENTS OF THE STATE IS ACTUALLY VERY CONSTRAINED AND THE DMV IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE PRIMARY PUBLIC FACING AGENCIES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN STATE GOVERNMENT. SO OUR CONSTITUENTS CHARACTERIZE A LOT OF THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT STATE GOVERNMENT BY THE SERVICE THAT THEY GET AT THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY DO INTERACT WITH. SO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. A PUBLIC FACING ORGANIZATION OF THE STATE WHERE OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE SPENDING A DAY OF THEIR LIVES TRYING TO GET SOMETHING SIMPLE DONE. IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THE SOLUTION ON THIS. BOB BUT I WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR THEIR CONSTITUENTS REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT. THE WHY. AND I KNOW THAT'S WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY WERE TALK ABOUT REAL IDEA WERE TALK ABOUT A BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS WERE TO TALK ABOUT A MAYBE TECHNOLOGICAL. IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE AND THESE ARE ALL APPROPRIATE THINGS FOR US BUT OUR CONSTITUENTS CARE ABOUT THE WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME TO GET MY VEHICLE LICENSE -- RENEWED HOW LONG IT'S GONNA TAKE ME TO GET THAT APPOINTMENT TO GET MY DRIVER'S LICENSE RENEWED AND THAT'S WHAT I REALLY REALLY HOPE THAT WERE ABLE TO SOLVE TODAY SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD -- TO BEING PART OF SOLUTION MISTER CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN COMMITTING THE HEARING. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER PATTERSON. THE BIGGEST CHAIRMAN AGAIN UP -- THAT MISTER THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS A BUDGET HEARING IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT AT THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO MAKE A START ASKING SOME OF THE KIND OF TOUGH QUESTIONS. FRANK YOU THAT DOUBT WE NEED TO BE ASKING YOU GETTING SOME ANSWERS. TO WHEN MANY CUSTOMERS ARE WAITING AS LONG AS EIGHT HOURS AT THE DMV. OUR ALARM BELL SHOULD BE GOING OFF SHOULD BEEN GOING OFF A LONG TIME AGO. WE HEAR A LOT OF EXCUSE MAKING THAT THIS IS THE REAL ID IT IS THERE. A THIS IS THE REASON THAT THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THESE DELAYS. BUT DOWN THIS NOT THE ONLY CAUSE OF THESE. LONG WAIT TIMES. AND QUITE FRANKLY AT THE AUDIT HEARING TOMORROW WE WILL NO DOUBT CONTINUE TO TO DEBT TODAY'S INQUIRY. AND WE'RE GOING TO DELVE DEEPER INTO THE DELAYS CAUSED BY REAL ID WHICH IS A PROBLEM. BUT AS AS WELL AS HORRIBLY OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY [inaudible] AND FAILURES OF NEW SYSTEMS AND IMPACTS ON CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES [inaudible] JUST YESTERDAY. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF THE DMB COLLAPSED. IF THAT DOESN'T TELL US. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A HUGE TECHNOLOGICAL. PROBLEMS WITH THE DMV NOTHING ELSE WILL. AS IT'S BEEN STATED EARLIER THE DMB TOUCHES THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS EVERY YEAR. MANY HAVE MADE APPOINTMENTS. BUT FOR OTHERS MAKING APPOINTMENTS BECOMING INCREASINGLY NOT AN OPTION. APPOINTMENT TIMES CAN BE WEEKS OR MONTHS OUT WITH A LICENSE EXPIRING IN JUST A FEW DAYS. WE'VE HEARD THIS FROM OTHER MEMBERS THE DMV EXISTS TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. IT SHOULD NOT BE THE TASK WITH THE CHALLENGE OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. TO SET UP THEIR LIVES. AROUND THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. UP DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WHEN WHERE HOW AND FOR HOW LONG THESE INDIVIDUALS MUST APPEAR [inaudible] BEFORE THEM. I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO BE UP SPEAKING ON BEHALF. OF DMB EMPLOYEES SCHOOL ARE JUST AS MUCH IMPACTED. AS THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. MANY ARE WORKING TWELVE HOUR DAYS SIX DAYS A WEEK AND THEY ARE SAYING AND YOU WILL HEAR SOME OF THAT TESTIMONY TOMORROW. WHERE ARE THE EMPLOYEES TO HELP US WE HAVE BEEN PROMISED OVER AND OVER AGAIN? I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF TALKING TO THESE EMPLOYEES. THESE ARE DEDICATED DMB EMPLOYEES. THEY HAVE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME LOVE TO THEIR JOBS. MANY OF THEM THOUGH ARE ASKING. IS IT HOPELESS. WHERE ARE THE NEW RECRUITS? IS THIS THE NEW NORMAL. SO WE FOUND OURSELVES TODAY A SITUATION THAT REQUIRES ACTION YES BUDGETARY ACTION MAY VERY WELL BE NEEDED. BUT I AM A BIT RESISTANT TO THE IDEA THAT THE SOLUTION HERE IS JUST THROW MORE MONEY AT THE DMV. WE HAVE DONE THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WE DID IT OVER A YEAR AGO. AND WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT WERE PROMISED TO BE FIXED AT THAT TIME. AND NOW I SUPPOSE WE'RE GOING TO BE OUT [inaudible] REQUESTING ADDITIONAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. APPARENTLY TO DO THE VERY SAME THING YOU WERE GIVEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO DO. OVER A YEAR AGO. OUT THERE ARE HIRING ISSUES THERE ARE MAJOR TECHNOLOGY ISSUES THERE ARE MANAGEMENT ISSUES THAT GO FAR BEYOND REAL REAL ID. AND UP YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM. THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THAT KIND OF A SERIES OF ISSUES. IN FACT FROM INSIDE THE DMV. THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH REAL ID WE UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THERE ARE SO MUCH THERE'S SO MUCH MORE AT STAKE HERE. THAN JUST RELY DE. AND FACT TOMORROW WE ARE GOING TO DISCOVER THAT THE ESTIMATES. OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD SHOW UP FOR REAL ID. OUR WAS WOEFULLY OVER PREDICTED. AND IN FACT FEWER SHOWED UP THAN YOU THOUGHT WOULD SHOW UP. NOW WE WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHY THE PLANNING WAS SO FAR OFF THE MARK. AND WHAT WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT GOING FORWARD. WE MAY NOT GET TO DISCUSS ALL OF THESE ISSUES HERE TODAY. BUT WE WILL TALK ABOUT THEM IN SOME DETAIL ABOUT THEM TOMORROW AT THE AUDIT HEARING. AND I WOULD SUGGEST HIGH END UP. THAT THE DMB BE PREPARED TO DELVE INTO THESE A ISSUES IN MUCH MORE DETAIL PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE TESTIMONY YOU WILL HEAR TOMORROW. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR A COUPLE MONTHS AGO IN JUNE I HAD A NEW FIELD REPRESENTATIVE IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE AND SHE TOOK OVER TRANSPORTATION ISSUES OFFER MY CONSTITUENTS. AND THE OTHER DAY I ASKED HER HOUSING GOING AND SHE SAID SHE FEELS LIKE SHE'S GOT MY PHD IN D. M. V. -- AND AND THAT THIS IS. IN THEN IT PREDOMINANTLY WHAT SHE'S BEEN DEALING WITH -- AND IN HER FIRST FEW MONTHS ARE ON THE JOB IS FRUSTRATED CONSTITUENTS -- WHO ARE WHO ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE INTERACTIONS THEY'VE HAD -- AS WE'VE HEARD AS WELL HIM HEAR MORE ABOUT A CONSTITUENT WHO TAG ME IN A SERIES OF TWEETS OVER A FRUSTRATINGLY LONG DAY -- AT THE DMV -- AND WAS JUST GETTING MORE AND MORE EXASPERATED WITH YA HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN OWE YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONE WRONG AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT AS STATE AS AS THE STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THIS ISN'T A CONSTITUENT WHO'S PREDISPOSED TO BASHING GOVERNMENT HE WORKED FOR THE FEDERAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT FOR EIGHT YEARS UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION -- SO EVERYBODY IS FRUSTRATED WITH THE EXPERIENCES THAT THEY'VE BEEN HAVING -- YEAH AND AND CLEARLY IT'S GOTTEN MUCH WORSE -- THIS YEAR -- I DON'T I DON'T WANNA REPEAT A LOT OF THE THINGS ON MY COLLEAGUES SAID BUT CLEARLY THEM THE DMV IS THE NUMBER ONE IN OUR ACTIONS THAT ARE CONSTITUENTS HAVE WITH STATE GOVERNMENT IN THEIR LIVES. AYE WHICH MAKES A REALLY IMPORTANT AND MAKE -- AND THINGS HAVE GOTTEN OFF TRACK AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE IDENTIFY YOU KNOW BOTH WHAT WHAT WENT WRONG BUT ALSO WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIX IT -- AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE CARROTS AND STICKS IS NOT GOING TO BE JUST. ON THE RESOURCES BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE MAKING CHANGES. ON TO HOW WE DO THINGS AND I'LL BE THE FIRST IS THAT I REPRESENT SILICON VALLEY -- AND WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY TO ME ó YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT SHOULD OPERATE LIKE A BUSINESS AND I SAY TO THEM WELL YOU KNOW YOU RUN A BUSINESS HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY IS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY GOES TOWARDS PROJECTS. WHERE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF FAILURE? AND THEN WHAT'S YOUR TOLERANCE FOR FAILURE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT TRIES SOMETHING AND IT DOESN'T WORK SO IS SO I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGE YOU KNOW. THAT THERE ISN'T A LOT OF TOLERANCE FOR RISK AND THEREFORE IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO UPDATE YOUR SYSTEMS -- AND THERE IS A LACK OF INCENTIVE TO DO SO BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT FAILURE BUT WE'VE HIT FAILURE -- AND AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING WRONG -- AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO FIX IT FAST SOME LOOKING FORWARD TO TO LEARNING ABOUT -- YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU GET THERE. THANK GOODNESS. FOR I THINK IT IS CHAIRMAN I WANNA I WANNA THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ON I THINK THAT -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER FREIGHT OF FRAZIER FIRS LEADERSHIP ON THE TRANSMISSION COMMITTEE AND I THINK I JIM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AS WELL BRING THIS ISSUE TO LIGHT -- WE ARE MADE MAY TWENTY SEVENTEEN LAST YEAR YOU TESTIFIED AT THE IN BE JUSTIFIED -- ASKING FOR TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS ADD TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN THAT. THE WAIT TIMES HAVE GOTTEN WORSE. AND ON TOP OF THAT REAL ID THAT THE ACT WAS ENACTED IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE SO. THIRTEEN YEARS AS PASSED. TO GET READY FOR THIS AND SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THAT IN THOSE THIRTEEN YEARS AND SO CALIFORNIANS. ARE RIGHTFULLY UPSET AND WE ARE ASKING WHO SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN THIS SITUATION AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIX THIS SITUATION IMMEDIATELY. AND SO THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE AND HOPE TO HEAR FROM UP HERE LOS ANSWERS AS WELL AS SOON THANK YOU BUT I THINK MISTER BRO.

I CAN TELL YOU IN MY DISTRICT OFFICES THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT I TOURED THE LAGUNA HILLS FACILITY -- NOT VERY EASILY WE ASKED SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY WERE LIKE RELUCTANT TO HAVE ME COME IN. AND BUT WE FINALLY GOT IN THERE AND TALK TO A COUPLE THE MANAGERS AND THEY EXPLAINED THE SITUATION THERE ARE CHALLENGES. AND I LEARNED A LOT FROM IT AND DUFF FROM THAT. WELL I THOUGHT ABOUT THE ISSUE AND RATHER THAN ASKING FOR MORE MONEY AND MORE STAFF WHICH GOVERNMENT TENDS TO DO -- I LOOKED AROUND AND YOU HAVE SOME PARTNERS ALREADY AUTO CLUB'S. IF CAR DEALERS SO THERE ARE PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO. CERTAIN LIMITED DMV SERVICES AND YOU AUDIT THERE SO THERE ARE TRANSACTIONS AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO MY FIRST YEAR I HAD A BILL TO EXPAND IT ANYBODY WHO WANT TO COME IN OF YET UPS STORE FED EX KINKO'S.

I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE MAJOR ACTIONS TAKEN THIS PAST WEEK AND THOSE TO BE EMPLOYMENT IN THE COMING WEEKS AND THE MONTHS. NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN CUSTOMER WAIT TIMES. BUT WE WANT TO DO BETTER AND WE WILL DO BETTER OUR CUSTOMERS DESERVE IT WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THIS CHALLENGE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO OUR OVERCOME IT. AND NOT OPEN TO ANY SUGGESTIONS REGARDING HOW I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE MENTIONED THEY GET SOME SUGGESTIONS I WANTED THINGS IS THAT IN TERMS OF A PARTNERSHIP WITH AUTO CLUBS AND WE HAVE PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR AUTO CLUB'S A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SENATE CALIFORNIA. A WITH THEY ARE SO THE CALIFORNIA HAS EXPANDED THEIR US SERVICE HOURS AND THEY HAVE HARDWARE PEOPLE. A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH. SELF SERVICE TERMINALS IN THEIR ON A CLIP OFFICES THE APART WITH THE VENDOR TO DO THAT SUIT DEFTLY ARE LEVERAGING THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR OTHER OTHER OF ENTITIES. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE ANY OTHER ONES IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON THAT. IN TERMS FOR REAL ID AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AT IT WHAT IF THINGS IS THAT -- TO GET READY FOR ID THE REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD TO PAS LAWS REGULATIONS UNTIL THOSE REGULATIONS ARE PASSED. A A STATE CANNOT DETERMINE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A REGULATIONS IN PLACE. AND WHILE DOING THAT WE WORK TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A VERY SECURE CARD CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE MOST SECURE A DRIVERS LICENSE ID CARDS IN ADDITION. A WE HAVE WE ISSUE OUR DRIVER LICENSE FOR SUCH A LOCATION THAT IS A REQUIREMENT. OF INDIGENT THAT A WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ONE THING IS THAT -- WE WERE ASKED TO SEE IF THEY COULD RELAX SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND IN TALKING WITH THE TIME HOLDEN SECURITY. A WE DO LET TIME VERIFICATION WITH SO SCARY ADMINISTRATION AND WE MARK OUR RECORD WITH THAT THEY STILL REQUIRE YOU TO BRING IN YOUR SOUL SECURITY CARTER DOCUMENT THE FULL SO SCARY NEVER SUCH AS A W.. TO AND THEY WOULD NOT RELAX THAT REQUIREMENT THEY SAID THAT REQUIRED. I WOULD NOT HAVE BEING IN THAT ADDITIONAL DOCUMENT. AND TERMS OF THE OTHER FEDERAL REQUIREMENT FOR RELY DE IS YOU HAVE TO BRING INTO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS TALKING WITH HOMELAND SECURITY. WAS ABLE TO GET THEM TO REQUIRE ONLY ONE DOCUMENT THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BRING IN AS WHEN WE SING YOU ARE -- DRIVER'S LICENSE IT DOES YOUR HOME ADDRESS AND IF YOU'RE NOT THERE REMOVE THAT IS RETURNED BACK TO THE POST US BACK TO US. SO ABLE TO GET THEM TO ALLOW ONLY ONE DOCUMENT AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DOCUMENTS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BRING AND AGAIN REDUCE WHAT WE HAVE TO REQUIRE. SO WE HAVE BEEN INTO THE TALK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- WE DO HAVE A LOT OF CALIFORNIA OTHER STATES HAVE ASKED THEM TO YOU IF THEY LEAD UP MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE EASIER FOR THE STATES TO IMPLEMENT IT BUT THAT THEY ARE NOT. OPEN TO CHANGING THOSE REQUIREMENTS. THE KEY QUESTIONS [inaudible] MISTER CHIP. THANK YOU AND AND SHARES A QUESTION ASSIDUOUS SHARE ANY ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT TO US UP VERY. UPGRADE YOUR HARDWARE SYSTEM IN OUR LIVES THEIR SOFTWARE SYSTEM. IN TALKING ABOUT IDENTIFICATION TO YOU ASAP [inaudible] THE EMAIL. THE BOOK COPY OFF TO YOU GOOD BOOM PASSPORT AS AN IDEAL ARE YOU HAVE TO SEE THE PHYSICAL AT ALL REQUIREMENTS TO WE HAVE TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS OF REACH ALL DOCUMENTS AND A PERSON HAS TO WE HAVE TO BE CREDENTIALED THE PERSON IN PERSON SO. WE CANNOT ACCEPT IT TO SENDING IT TO LAST WEEK AND WE HAVE TO SEE THE ORIGINAL FEDERAL REQUIREMENT YES THEY IN TURN OFF YOUR YOUR THE EQUIPMENT. YOUR YOUR YOU AREN'T. HARDWARE THAT AT A SOFTWARE. IS THAT ANY NEW ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT SO YOU CAN. BETTER SERVE OUR COMMUNITY. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF MODERNIZING IT SYSTEMS WE'VE HAD A REQUEST THAT WE DID RECEIVE FUNDING WE ARE IN THE PROCESS. A WE HAVE DID MODERNIZE ON THE FINE IN THE DRIVER'S LICENSE SYSTEM ON THE FINE AND WE ARE GOING TO FINISH MODERNIZING. AND THE FRONT AND ON THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION AND ALL THE BACK AND SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF MODERNIZING OUR SYSTEMS THERE FROM WHAT WOULD THAT CAUSE FOOD PACKED HER DO YOU HAVE ANY ESTIMATE. FOR MODERN I THINK YEAH SO SO THE PROPOSAL WE PUT FORWARD I'M WITH THE BUDGET THIS AND PAST FISCAL YEAR WAS RIGHT AROUND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TO DO THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION. AND ALSO THE CONTROL CASHIERING PIECE [inaudible] WHEN HER? BY PROVIDING CARE. MISS COOPER MISSED DOING REGARDER COMMENTS ABOUT OUTSIDE AGENCIES USING THOSE THAT WAS JUST IMPLEMENTED YESTERDAY CORRECT. WHEN WHAT YOU THINK USING OUTSIDE AGENCIES TO A SISTER EMPLOYEES? YES DID YES WE HAD I GOT THESE LOAN EMPLOYEES THEY WERE DEPLOYED YESTERDAY SOME FROM HACKERS WERE DEPLOYED LAST WEEK. OF THEY WILL STAY OUT THERE -- AS WE ARE ABLE TO FILL BEHIND FOR THE OF POSITIONS THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR SO HERE'S MY QUESTION IS DMV IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM CHP NEED DIESEL BY BRINGING THOSE OUTSIDE AGENCIES INTO YOUR OFFICE IS. IT'S DIFFERENT SYSTEMS FOR COMPUTERS HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE AND WHAT IS THAT LEARNING CURVE SO THEY ARE DOING ITS SO THEY ARE DOING NON PRODUCTION WORK SO THEY ARE WHAT WE HAD DONE IS TAKEN TAINT TRAINED TECHNICIANS. TO BUILD A TRIAGE LINE OUTSIDE HELP CUSTOMERS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT DOCUMENTS SO THE LOAN EMPLOYEES WILL BE -- MAKING SURE THE DOC CUSTOMERS HAVE THE RIGHT DOCUMENTS DE FOR RELY DE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A PASSPORT YOU HAVE APPRECIATIVELY GET YOUR W. TWO IF YOU'RE SO SCREEN NUMBER. RESIDENTS A DOCUMENT SO THAT WE WANT CUSTOMERS WAY LYING IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT DOCUMENTS SO THEY CAN GO HOME AND GET THE RIGHT DOCUMENTS. AND WE ALSO WITH -- OR ELECTRONIC DOLLARS LICENSE FORM THEY'RE ASSISTING CUSTOMERS AND HOW TO WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE SCREENS SO THEY'RE NOT DOING TECHNICAL WORK SO YOU COULD TRAVEL AND PER DIEM FOR THESE EMPLOYEES WHAT WHAT NUMBER WHAT'S THE UNIVERSE EMPLOYEES THERE. BEING SHIPPED OUT ARE BEING USED BY DMB. AT FOUR I JUST FOR THE DMV UPLAND OUTSIDE EMPLOYEES WILL TOTAL TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES DEVIANT PLAYS BEING SENT OUT. THAN OUTSIDE AGENCY EMPLOYEES BEING USED SO OUTSIDE EMPLOYEES THEY ARE -- IN THE LOCATION THAT WE HAVE A FIELD OFFICES SO THEY ARE AT THEIR HOME BASE A TO AN OFFICE CLOSE. TO OUT WHERE THEY LIVE SO THERE IS JUST TRAVEL TO THE FIELD OFFICE LOCATION. ARE YOU PAY FOR THEIR SALARIES. BUT WE WILL WORK OUT IN HE INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT WITH THOSE AGENCIES ARE YOU HAVING ANY EMPLOYEES FROM DMV OFFICE UP AND TOLD THAT SOME THE POLICEMEN OFF THE FLYING TO OTHER LOCATIONS YES THEY ARE WE ARE SAYING THEM OUT BECAUSE OF OFFICES NEED ADDICTIVE. ASSISTANCE SO WE ARE FLYING THEM OUT FACILITIES THE ESTIMATED COST AND WHERE WOULD THAT FUNDING COME FROM TO PAY FOR THESE COSTS INCURRED. THOSE ARE COMING FROM ICE PACK PERSONAL SERVICES COSTS WE WOULD HAVE TO GET UP AND AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THAT IS AND GET BACK TO ON THAT IS A SUFFICIENT MONIES TO PAY FOR THOSE COST. OF ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT. CURRENT CURLY OUR CURRENT BUDGET WE WE CAN FIND THAT. FOR HOW THEY GET THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE GONNA BE THERE UNTIL WE AYE WE HAD PUT THE ASK BOARD FOR ADDITIONAL TO IT AND THIRTY P. WEISSMAN SIXTEEN MILLION -- ASKED OF FOR THE AUGMENTATION THAN THOSE I ONCE WE GET THOSE EMPLOYEES HIRED AND TRAINED AT A HIGHER THEY WERE DEPLOYED TO THE FIELD OFFICES WERE ALONE IN PLACE AROUND RIGHT NOW SO I GUESS BILLS EMPLOYERS ARE HIRING THAT HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT. NGUYEN SEVERE OFFICES ASKED FOR JUST. A YEAR AGO. PREVIOUS YEAR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WHEN ASKED FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES THERE TOLD NO YOU CAN'T HIRE THOSE EMPLOYEES WE'VE I'VE HEARD THAT FROM NUMBER OF IT. INDIVIDUALS INDIAN BE. THAT OF CULT LAYOFFS IS A REPORTED THAT THAT. WHEN THE SUPERVISORS ASKED FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS ARE TOLD WILL HOLD ON YOU CAN HURDLES EMPLOYEES RIGHT AWAY? AND WILL HAVE TO GO BACK AND TALK TO THOSE OFFICES SO WE HAVE HIRING TEAMS IN PLACE WE HAVE EIGHT REGIONS WE PUT TOGETHER HIRING TEAMS WE CAN EXPEDITE. THAT THE REVIEW THE APPLICATION AND INTERVIEW SO WE ARE WORKING TO GET EMPLOYEES OUT TO THOSE OFFICE. IF THAT IS A WE WERE DEATHLY FALL IF YOU KNOW LET ME KNOW WHAT THOSE OFFICES I WILL FOUGHT WITH THOSE MARRIAGES BECAUSE THAT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING SO I GUESS WHEN US FEELS POSITIONS LAST YEAR. HOW MIDDLE SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN FILL? AND THE THOSE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN FILLED ALL OF THEM. CRACKED SO IT WAS THE LAST YEAR'S A BLAST FROM. FISCAL YEAR WE HAD TWO INTERNET WE AUTHORIZED TO UNDER NINETEEN POSITIONS WE ACTUALLY FILLED MORE THAN THE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN AND THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THAT WERE IN. POWER BUT YOU DIDN'T AUTHORIZE FOR FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THAT THE CONTINUATION OF THE TWO EIGHTEEN WE HAD OVER FILLED THAT THE TWO EIGHTEEN AND HAVE ROUGHLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POSITIONS. AND SO THOSE CARRY FOR TO THIS YEAR. IS WHAT WE'RE HIRING NOW WITH THE DIRECTOR JUST MENTIONED AND WHAT PLANNING TO HAVE THAT ALL WRAPPED UP BY THE END OF AUGUST. WITH AYE THERE'S ABOUT FIFTEEN POSITIONS LEFT. SO AS FAR AS A REAL LADIES GO THAT'S THE CRUX THE PROBLEM WITH THEIR AN UNDERESTIMATION OF FAMILY PHOTO COME FORWARD SINCE THAT'S BUGGING YOU DOWN THE AND WOOD WAS WHO WHO PLANNED FOR IT WAS A PLANNING INCORRECT. NOW SO THAT SO THE CHALLENGE WAS NEVER NECESSARY IN THIS KIND OF GOES BACK -- TO PATTERSON'S COMMENT AS IT RELATES TO THE TIME FRAME FOR THE TRANSACTION THROUGH THE EDUCATIONOF THE CUSTOMER WHAT WE'RE SEEING. IS THAT THE TIME VALUE FOR THE TRANSACTION ITSELF IT AND CHANGING IT THAT ADDITIONAL FIVE MINUTE CONVERSATION IT'S THAT THE THE TALK TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE WITH EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE. ARE EVERYTHING A CUSTOMER THAT COMES AND AS IT RELATES TO WHETHER THEY'RE GIVING RELATING OR NON RELATED HAVING TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND. I'M WHETHER THEY CHOOSE TO GET A REAL ID ARE NOT LIKE THE AND THEN THE DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO WHAT IS THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT. SO SO RIGHT NOW THAT THIS STATEWIDE AVERAGES ABOUT ON OUR HAVE WE AND WE KNOW WE'VE HEARD THAT YEAH EMPLOYEE CUSTOMERS ARE WAITING. LONGTIME EIGHT HOURS SIX HOURS AND I THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN THERE IN DIFFERENT OFFICES WHERE WE HAVE OUR CUSTOMERS ARE WAITING LONGER. AND SO WE ARE WORKING ON THAT SO WHAT WE ALSO DID EMPLOYMENT IS A COMMAND CENTER ANNIE IQ MARCHING TEAM SO WE ARE MARCHING THE WAIT TIMES IN REAL TIME. SO THAT WE ARE WATCHING EVERY OFFICE OF HOW LONG THE WAIT TIMES ARE AND WE ALSO ASKING EVERY OFFICE. CALLING INTO THE REGION OFFICE IN THERE WE'RE FINDING OUT IF WE HAVE -- EMPLOYEES THAT ARE NOT THAT CALLING IN SICK FOR THEY HAVE AND WE DEFINITELY HAVE SCHEDULED A TIME OFF WE'RE MOVING EMPLOYEES AROUND TO LEVEL OFF THAT THE WORKLOAD SO THAT WE HAVE. EMPLOYEES AT ALL THE OFFICES. AND THEN AS A THE WAIT TIMES ARE MY HIM OF IT TODAY. EVERY DAY IS THAT IF WE SEE WHERE -- CUSTOMERS ARE WAITING A LONG TIME WE ARE ADJUSTING WHETHER IT'S AN APPOINTMENT VERSUS NON APPOINTMENT CUSTOMER. AND THAT IF THERE AND WE SEE THAT AND OFFICES GET BUSY AND WE KNOW OUR OFFICES ARE WE'VE BEEN VERY BUSY AND I THERE IS A PERSON THIS MUST BE MARK THAT IS MARTINE ARE QUEUING SYSTEM. MARCHING WHAT CUSTOMERS WAITING HOW LONG THEY'RE WAITING AND WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CUSTOMERS. NO ONE SHOULD WAIT LONG AND MAKING SURE THOSE CUSTOMERS GET SERVED BUT THE TINIEST TOLD ME IS AN ACCURATE AND THAT THAT'S LIKE IT'S THAT'S CREEK THE ISSUE BECAUSE I WE HAVE DOCTORS FROM BEING V. TALKING ABOUT WAIT TIMES. FOR PLUMAS NOT APPOINTMENTS THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING SO. THAT THAT'S THE DISCONNECT RIGHT THERE COMING FROM YOU. YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S A OUR WHATEVER LEFT DOES NOT HAPPEN THAT'S NOT THE FACT THAT WE ARE MONITORING EVERY OFFICE -- ALL THE OFFICES AND WHAT CAN WAIT TIMES ARE I'M GONNA REPORT BUT THE WAIT TIMES ARE. AND WE ARE. OUT WITH THE ADDITION THAT'S COMING ON BOARD WILL HAVE. TO BE ABLE. TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS AND GET TO WORK TO WORK REDUCE THAT WAIT TIMES AND DEFTLY WE KNOW THAT CUSTOMERS ARE WAITING A LONG TIME VERTICALLY GOING TO WORK TO HIRE MORE EMPLOYEES. TO REDUCE THAT WAIT TIME. BUT BUT LIMITS FELT MISTER COOPER'S PART SO IF YOU'RE DOING REAL TIME MONITORING WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LONGER WAIT TIMES AT SOME OF THE MORE CROWDED OFFICES. GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES -- WE ARE SEEN IT COULD BE IT'S AND WE'RE JUST CHECKING TODAY US SOME OFFICES RIGHT FOR OUR SOME OFFICERS SIX HOURS AND THAT IS WHERE. I TODAY WE GET WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL GET THE PERMISSION TO HIRE ADDITIONAL PLACE THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND TERMS OF PROCESSING AND THEN ALL THE OTHER UP THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT TERMS OF IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES -- WE WILL -- WITH IT OF BEING ABLE TO DO THE ELECTRONIC GRAYSON AND THEN SEPTEMBER WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PULL IF YOU COMPLETE YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE ONLINE UP GET ONLINE. THOUGH TO PUT THAT INFORMATION INTO A DRIVERS LICENSE SYSTEM OUR TECHNICIANS WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO KEEP THAT INFORMATION WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT FOR EFFICIENCY PURPOSES. AND THAT WILL SAVE AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES OF KEEN TIME WHERE THE CUSTOMER WE DON'T AYE TECHNICIANS AND I HAVE TO KEEP THAT INFORMATION THAT'LL MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS BOTH. FOR THE CUSTOMER AND FOR THE EMPLOYEE IN TERMS OF PROCESSING AND GETTING FOR CUSTOMERS DONE SERVE FASTER QUICKER AND WE CAN. PLEASE DISCUSS YOUR YOU JUST REFERENCED IT NOW THE JULY TWENTY SEVENTH. LETTER YOU SENT TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE. BUDGET COMMITTEE ARE ACTUALLY THE PUBLIC FINANCE I BELIEVE. AFFORDED TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE REGARDING TO REQUEST. YES WE SUBMITTED THAT REQUEST AS DEPARTMENT VICE ESTIMATED THAT'S FOR SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WOULD -- ALSO THAT EQUATE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MORE POSITIONS WE ARE. IN ANTICIPATION OF GETTING THAT APPROVAL WHICH WOULD OF THE PLACE INTO THE HIGH OFFICES AT THE HIGHS WAIT TIMES. WE'VE ALREADY POT STARTED THE PROCESS TO ADVERTISE THE POSITIONS HASN'T AS WE GET APPLICATIONS WE ARE GOING TO START THE PROCESS TO INTERVIEW BUT I ASK IS FOR CLINTON THIRTY POSITIONS AND THEY WILL BE PLACED. IN OFFICES WITH THE HIGHEST WAIT TIME GREAT THANK YOU MISTER HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THAT HAVING THIS HEARING -- FOR MANY ISSUES REGARDING THE STATE -- IT. THE COMPLAINTS ARE CONSISTENT BUT THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE. UNFORTUNATELY THE CONSISTENT ARE THE COMPLAINT OF INDEED SPIKED VERY SIGNIFICANTLY THIS YEAR UP ONE OF THOSE COMPLAINTS I'M HEARING A LOT ABOUT AYE IS ABOUT THE THE SYSTEM JUST SHUTTING DOWN AND THAT'S A BIG PART POINT OF FRUSTRATION THAT PEOPLE HAVE IS THAT. ACCUSE NOT MOVING AT ALL BECAUSE THE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS ARE OPERATING OUT WERE THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE OPERATING BUT DO WE HAVE ENOUGH -- TO COVER THAT TRANSITION OR IS WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE WITH THIS IT AMOUNT OF THE SOFTWARE PROBLEMS. SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AN INCH AT WORK WITH THEM THAT IF THERE% ISN'T ANY ME ANY AYE AYE AYE T. SYSTEM CHANGER UPGRADE. THAT IS BEING DONE OFF HOURS ON THE WEEKENDS AND THEN WHEN THAT IS BEING DONE ADEQUATE TESTED SO THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE NOT GOING DOWN. WHEN IT'S WHEN IT DOES GO IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK BECAUSE CREDIT DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WORK WITH THEM IN TERMS OF PUBLISHING WHAT THAT PROBLEM IS? THAT WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT DOES NOT AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS ANY CHANGE OR UPGRADE IS GOING TO BE AT BE. APPROVED AT THE HIGHER LEVELS -- AND DEFTLY BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR BEFORE ANY CHANGES AND SAME WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DMV. WITH FOR US IT'S ARE ADAPTING MAYOR UPGRADE [inaudible] YES HYSLOP. SO WE CAN MINIMIZE THE SYSTEM GOING DOWN. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I GET A LOT FROM CONSTITUENTS AYE IS ABOUT THE AB SIXTY DRIVERS LICENSE THE NON CITIZEN DRIVER'S LICENSES AND HOW MUCH. I IS THAT CONTRIBUTING TO WASTE WAIT TIMES UP OR DO WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE AYE THOSE ADDITIONAL DRIVER'S LICENSES. ADD THOSE A LOT OF APPLICANTS FOR THOSE HAVE LEVELED OFF REDOING PROBABLY ABOUT. NINE TO TEN THOUSAND A MONTH ONLINE THAT TWO THOUSAND A WEEK SO THAT THAT HAS LEVELED OFF. HOW IS NOT AFFECTING -- IN TERMS OF ANYWAY WANTING. TO GET A REAL ID SO THAT IS PRETTY PRIMITIVE LEVELED OFF. THANK COMMISSIONER. THANK YOU MISTER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS CHAIRMAN ALONG THANK -- YOU AND MR A FRAZIER FOR PUTTING THE SONGS I THINK IT'S VERY TIMELY -- SPEAKING OF MISTER HARPER ASKED MY QUITE. YOU. LET ME JUST KIND OF FINESSE IT YOUR TECHNOLOGY WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN TERMS OF TRYING TO PUT A INFRASTRUCTURE. IN PLACE THAT WILL ADDRESS WHAT MR HARPER TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF COMPUTER GLITCHES -- A FRAMEWORK BECAUSE I'M HEARING THAT YOU KNOW THAT -- IN FACT THAT YOU GUYS GO TRY TO RESPOND TO COMPUTER GLITCHES BUT IS THERE A MECHANISM OR PLAN. TO ANTICIPATE THESE KIND OF GLITCHES MOVING. FOR I HAVE WELL AND IF IT IF IT LETS DOES OCCUR I'VE YOU KNOW WE WHAT WE DO IS WE PLAN. FOR AYE WHEN WE DO ANY UPGRADES OR ANY CHANGES IN THOSE ARE -- TESTED AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS LOAD BALANCING THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO THAT THE INTENT IS THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE A COMPUTER GLITCH IN SO HE SAID. IF YOU WANT TO ANTICIPATE -- WE NEED YOU ARE JOB ENSURING THAT IT IS ADEQUATELY TESTED PLAN FOR THAT IS DONE OFF HOURS AND NOT WHERE IT WOULD EFFECT. OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES. OKAY MY NEXT QUESTION IS -- SECURITY -- I KNOW THAT I THINK HAVE PRIVATE SECURITY -- AND SO -- AND I REPRESENT ONE THE DIEM THESE IN MY DISTRICT AND SECURITY IS AN ISSUE -- AS RACE OF THIS PARTICULAR DMV AND GIVE EXAMPLE MY WIFE WAS ADDED GMB -- WE WAIT IN LINE TO AND SHE THERE WAS A SITUATION THAT TRANSPIRED WHERE THEY ACTUALLY GRABBED HER AND PULLED HER OVER THE COUNTER ALONG WITH. OTHER INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE SECURE IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA IS IS IS EXTREMELY BAD I DON'T KNOW THAT'S CONSISTENT -- IN OTHER AREAS BUT SECURITY IS CERTAINLY AN ISSUE -- AT THE DMV IN WHICH I REPRESENTS A CAN YOU SPEAK TO SECURITY. SO THAT IS THROUGH A A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR THAT'S A AND SO -- OF I I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT WHAT OFFICES AND WHAT THEIR ISSUES ARE WITH THE SECURITY SO WE CAN GO BACK AND DIRECTLY ADDRESS IT WITH THAT SECURITY IN TERMS OF THE OFFICE NOBODY SHOULD BE GRABBED AND SO THAT I'M GRATEFUL THEY DID BECAUSE IT WAS A A BECAUSE THEY'RE SO THAT WAS IT AN INFANT IN AND SEND IT YEAH O. THESE INCIDENTS HAPPEN. YEAH BUT AND SO I YES THERE ARE INCIDENTS AND THAT'S WHY WE DO HAVE SECURITY TO ENSURE THAT IF THERE IS ANY -- CUSTOMERS THAT ARE -- NOT BEHAVING VERY WELL THAT DAY THAT THEY HAVE WORKED TO CALM DOWN THE SITUATION AND IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT -- THERE IS OF KNOWING THAT THINGS THAT'LL GET A HAND WE ALSO WILL CALL THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. BUT THEY DO COME ASSIST OFFICES BROUGHT HER HER PURSE OR USED TO BE THERE -- AND IMITATE THE REASON WHAT. BECAUSE OF THE WAIT TIME. I'M IS ALMOST OF HAVING -- SOME LEVEL USE THAT EXAMPLE. IT THE WAIT TIME IS SO LONG. THAT PEOPLE ARE IRRITATED -- WITH YOU BOB SOMEONE. THERE AND ON A HOT DAY THAT SETS OFF SITUATIONS THAT TRANSPIRED THERE THAT'S BEYOND THAT THE PERSONNEL CONTROL -- AGAIN IS THAT WHEN YOU GO TO THE DMV ELISE IN MY EXPERIENCE I'M GOING TO BE SPENT AN HOUR TO TWO HOURS THERE TO DMB JEST GOING FROM ONE PLACE -- INCOME IN FACT TO THE OTHER AND SO THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS ARE EXPLOSIVE -- AT THE DMV DISTANT WITH OTHER DMV'S BUT THE WAIT TIME IS CERTAINLY AN ISSUE. THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND WHAT WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO DO WITH OUR A STAR HERE WINDOW -- THAT'S WHY WE HAVE -- EMPLOYEES TRIAGE IN THE LINE THAT IF CUSTOMERS DON'T NEED TO BE THERE IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT DOCTORS THAT CAN GIVE IT BACK LEISURE TIME SO THAT WE COULD DO THAT WAIT TIME. WE ALSO ARE OUT WORKING TO GET THE CUSTOMERS IN SOONER BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WITH THE WEATHER IT IS HOT AND PEOPLE CAN'T STAND OUT THERE IN. A LONG PERIOD OF TIME SO WE ARE WORKING TO EXPEDITE TO GET CUSTOMERS IN THE OFFICE SOONER IN SO WE HAVE A SIMPLIFIED THAT IF YOU JUST ARE A VEHICLE REGISTRATION DRIVERS LICENSE -- OR A COMBINATION OF THE TWO OR DISABLED THAT YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GET THAT TYPE THE TICKET AND NOT A GET WE HAD -- TWELVE CARRIERS OF THE TICKETS WE JUST SIMPLIFIED IT TO SEVEN CATEGORIES SO THAT YOU'RE JUST GIVEN THE TICKET AND YOU CAN COME INSIDE AND SIT DOWN. AND THEN OUT WORK TO GET THE TECHNICIANS TO CALL YET SO WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO GET THE CUSTOMERS IN THE OFFICE SOONER AND THEY CAN -- SIT DOWN OR WITH OUR SOON TEXTILES VACATION WE'LL GET THAT NOTIFICATION SO WE I UNDERSTAND THAT DEFTLY WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CUSTOMERS ARE SAFE OUTSIDE. WE'RE WORKING TO GET THEM INSIDE AND THEN WORKING WITH ADDITIONAL POSITIONS IN THE PROCESS APPROVALS EFFICIENCIES TO GET THE CUSTOMER SURVEY AFTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS PATTERSON AND THAT ALSO WENT CAN I ADD JUST ONE MORE THING THAT WE ALSO DID ADD AN EXPEDITE WINDOW SO HEARD CONCERNS FROM SOME OF THE MEMBERS -- THAT IF YOU HAVE A SIMPLE TRANSACTION YOU'RE PICKING UP IT'S STABLE PLACARD THE PICKING UP YOUR PLAY TO JUST GETTING A VEHICLE RECORD OR YOU NEED TO COME BACK AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE. PUT YOUR SMOG WE HAVE AT IT CREATED WHEN WE KNOW THAT IT'S EXPEDITE YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO GET A TICKET AT STAR HERE THROUGH THE TRIAGE PROCESS YOU'LL BE DIRECTED STRAIGHT INSIDE AND BE PROCESS. BUT THE COULD YOU HAVE HEARD% COMPLAINTS I WAITED FIVE OR SIX HOURS AND I HAD A SIMPLE FIVE MINUTE TRANSACTION SO WE HAVE CREATED THOSE EXPECT WINDOWS YOU CAN GO STRAIGHT TO THAT WINDOW. AND NOT EVEN GET A TICKET. THEY COULD MISS SPENT A FEW UP. WE'VE WE'VE HEARD THE TERM -- COMPLETE COMPUTER GLITCHES ARE. YOU'RE HAVING SUBSTANTIAL AND RECURRING. OUTAGES. IT'S NOT JUST GLITCHES. HOW MANY OUTAGES HAVE YOU HAD? RECENTLY. HOW LONG DO THEY LAST? AND DO YOU HAVE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR TECHNOLOGY. TO BE ABLE TO DO THE KINDS OF TECHNOLOGICAL ASSISTING. BUT YOU HAVE SUGGESTED THAT YOU ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT LIKE TEXTING AND OTHER THINGS GOING. SO THE TEXAS SOME OF THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTS US OF TAXING IS DONE TO THE VENDOR FOR ACUMEN SYSTEM SO THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. IN TERMS OF OUR SYSTEMS A WE DID EVAN I DID YESTERDAY -- WE WERE RECOVERED BY ABOUT THAT I THINK ABOUT A TEN O'CLOCK NINE THIRTY TEN O'CLOCK -- SYSTEMS REQUIRE BUT NOT ALL THE SYSTEMS WERE DOWN ALL OVER WITH WORKSTATIONS WERE DOWN -- ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF WORKSTATIONS ARE DOWN THE REST WERE COMING BACK THAT AND SO WE WORK WITH OUR DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TROUBLE SHOULD WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. AND OF WORK WITH THEM IN TERMS. OF ALL AND I THE EXACT NUMBER I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME TODAY WILL GET BACK WITH YOU FOR THAT. NOW WE ARE MARCHING AND DEFTLY WORKING WITH OUR PARTNER THE PART OF TECHNOLOGY AND ADDRESSING WHERE WE WILL WORK TO DO ANY UPGRADES AFTER HOURS AND ON THE WEEKENDS AND THEN TO ENSURE THAT WE DO ADEQUATE TESTING SO THAT THESE GLITCHES IN THE SYSTEMS DO NOT GO DOWN. DO YOU HAVE A A SENSE OF I CAN. YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR. CAN'T YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF THE SCOPE OF HOW MANY OUTAGES. CAN'T I'M BUT MAYBE NOT A NUMBER BUT REGULARLY [inaudible] BODY. EVERY NOW AND THEN. NOT VERY OFTEN. HOW SERIOUS ARE YOUR OUTAGES? SO ANYMORE AND SO. I THERE MAY BE WHO IN GOT YESTERDAY WAS FOR A COUPLE HOURS DEFTLY WE WORK QUICKLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY OTHER MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE I IT COULD BE A A HALF A DAY BUT DIDN'T AND WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED WHAT. IN TROUBLE SHOOT AND FIND THE ROOT CAUSE AND WE WILL WE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WORK WITH AND THE VENDORS THAT SUPPORT OUR SYSTEMS. IN TERMS OF FINDING WHAT THE ROOT CAUSE IS AND SO WE HAVE WORKED QUICKLY DETERMINE WHAT THAT ROOT CAUSES AND THEN WORK TO FIGURE WHAT TECHNOLOGY DO WE NEED TO DO WE NEED TO REPLACE A PART. WAS THERE ANY A FAILURE OF OF THE HARDWARE -- THEN WE HAVE TO WORK WILL GET TO FIGHT TO THE VENDORS THAT WE HAVE ON ON SITE THAT WE PARTNER WITH TO GET EQUIPMENT AND AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN. I'M ASKING FOR A DESCRIPTIVE TERMINOLOGY THAT WAS NOT AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION HOW OFTEN. BUT A LOT A LITTLE. EVERY NOW AND THEN I MEAN YOU YOU YOU MUST HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE DESCRIPTION OF HOW OFTEN. YOUR TECHNOLOGY FAILS. CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME KIND OF A DESCRIPTION. FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THIS DEPARTMENT. SO -- AS WE DIDN'T THERE WAS AN UPGRADE THAT WAS DONE OVER THE WEEKEND -- WE DID HAVE A FAILURE OF A WORD NOT ALL THE WORK STATION WERE OPENED YESTERDAY THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. OF WE HAVE I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO GET THE DEFINITE NUMBERS OF WHERE WE HAVE A OUTAGES I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME TODAY ADEPTLY GET YOU THAT TOMORROW. TERM. A QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO THE WAIT TIMES AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REALITY OF THE WAIT TIMES AND WHAT YOU REPORT. ARE WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS TOMORROW. A BUT THERE ARE INCREASINGLY INDICATIONS. THAT -- YOU'RE NOT REALLY TELLING. THE STRAIGHT STORY ABOUT THE WAIT TIME SO YOU'RE POSTING. ON THE INTERNET A WAIT TIME OF WHAT AN HOUR OR SO. IS THAT NOT CALCULATED FROM THE TIME THAT THE INDIVIDUAL GETS A TICKET. AND THE TIME THAT THEY GET TO A WINDOW WHAT I'M HEARING IS THERE ARE. SUBSTANTIAL WAIT TIMES AHEAD OF ALL OF THAT. AND YOUR REPORTING ESSENTIALLY TICKET TO WINDOW WAIT TIME INSTEAD OF A COMPLETE. IN THE LINE THROUGH THE DOOR. THROUGH THE WAY. AT THROUGH THE QUEUING TO THE TICKET TO THE WINDOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN [inaudible] THAT. SO I'VE YES OF THE WAIT TIME IS WHEN YOU GET A TICKET TO WIN YOUR SERVE BY THAT BY A TECHNICIAN THAT AS THE WAIT TIME THAT WAS REPORT ON OUR WEBSITE. AYE WE ARE WORKING WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED WHERE WE ARE -- TRACKING THE TIME IT CUSTOMERS WAIT OUTSIDE SO IT IS A MANUAL PROCESS WE ARE GIVEN A CUSTOMER CARD AND THIS IS THAT THE TIME THAT THEY SAY THEY ARE THE LAST PERSON IN LINE READING THAT ON THE OUR WORK COLLECTING THAT. THE TURN THAT INTO THE START HERE WINDOW WHERE COMPLAIN ALL THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WE HAVE IT WE KNOW HOW LONG CHRISTMAS ARE WAITING -- ON THE HOUR EVERY HOUR OF WE ARE WORKING TO POST THAT ON OUR WEBSITE THAT IS NOT PART OF BY QUEUING SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN POST. THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MANUALLY IMPORT WERE TALKED. SIGH POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE SO CUSTOMERS. WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WAIT WOULD BE WAITING OUTSIDE AND THEN WAITING TO GET PROCESS AND WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PRESIDENT [inaudible] METHODOLOGY. FROM FROM TICKET TO WINDOW. ARM. IS INCOMPLETE INFORMATION AND ESSENTIALLY REPORTS A FALLACY IT'S NOT [inaudible] REAL. IT IS TICKET TO WINDOW. AND WHEN YOU POST SOMETHING ON THEIR WEB THAT SAYS ONE THING AND THEN THE EXPERIENCE BY. PEOPLE WHO COME MAN AT IT'S TWO THREE FOUR HOURS IN LINE THEN YOU GET A TICKET IT'S ANOTHER COUPLE HOURS TO THE TO THE WINDOW WOULD YOU. AGREE THAT THAT IS NOT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCURACY AND% THAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING A BETTER JOB. SO WE ARE WORKING WE ARE MEASURING WHERE WE ARE -- CLICK IN THE INFORMATION ON HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR THE WAIT TIME OUTSIDE WE ARE CLICK THAT INFORMATION LIKE SAID. OREGON THE VENDOR TO GET THAT INFORMATION POSTED SO WE CAN BE TRANSPARENT AND COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE CUSTOMER SO THAT THEY WILL KNOW WHAT THE WAIT TIME IS OUTSIDE APPROXIMATELY AND THE WEIGHT DOT TIME TO GET SERVED. AYE WHEN THEY GET A TICKET ANSWER BY A TECHNICIAN SO YES -- OUR WEBSITE DOES INDICATE WHAT THE TIME IS TO GET SERVED A WHEN YOU GET THERE WE ARE WORKING TO UP A POST THE TIME THAT IT TAKES THAT OUTSIDE THE LINE OUTSIDE. A WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO THAT YET WE'RE TALKING ARE GOING TO SEE IF WE CAN GETTHAT POSTED SO THAT. THE CUSTOMERS TRULY KNOW WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS A MAYBE. TRACK I WOULD I WOULD THINK THAT TRANSPARENCY AND TRYING TO BE ACCURATE. BUT YOU CERTAINLY COULD HAVE DONE SOME. ROUGH SKETCH ESTIMATES BASICALLY AND REPORTING THAT WHICH BASICALLY SAYS DUE TO THE VOLUME DUE TO SOME OF THESE WEIGHT ISSUES. THERE MAY BE TWO THREE FOUR HOUR WAITS BEFORE YOU GET A TICKET. I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE OR THAT OF RIGHT TO KNOW PRECISELY WHAT THEY'RE GETTING AND YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO GO TO THE TECHNOLOGY TO UTILIZE IT. AND YET THE TECHNOLOGY IS FAULTY IT IS FAILING AND EVEN WHEN YOU USE THE TECHNOLOGY. YOU'RE NOT CLEAR YOU'RE NOT ACCURATE WITH IT I WANNA ASK ONE FINAL QUESTION HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF MODERNIZING -- WHEN IS THAT GOING TO BE DONE WHEN WILL YOU BE ABLE TO REPORT TO US WE HAVE A MODERN? TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGICAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THAT WE HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE IN. THAT IT WILL DO ALL OF THE TRANSACTIONS WE WANTED OUT WE WILL NOT HAVE DOWN TIMES AND THAT THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION IS TRUSTWORTHY WHEN DO WE GET. TO THAT KIND OF REPRESENTATION TO THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE SO WE WE THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR APPROVING OUR PRIOR FUNDING REQUEST WE HAVE BEGUN THE PROJECT WE HAVE THE PROJECT TEAM ON SITE. OF WE ARE A WORKING IN TERMS OF THE MODERNIZATION ON THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION SITE THAT PROJECT HAS BEGUN. A WE ARE WORKING ON THAT AND WE ARE WORKING ON THE BUSINESS OF CARDS FOR THEM FUND AND MODERNIZATION AND NOW WE ADDED THAT FUNDING REQUEST THIS IS THIS PAST BUDGET YEAR TO ASK FOR THAT FUNDING SO WEAK. THAT PROJECT IS UNDER WAY I BELIEVE IT WILL BE DONE IN THREE YEARS. AB THAT THEM WITH A MULTI DAY THAT REMEMBER THE MULTI PHASED APPROACH WE'RE GONNA NAM GO WITH THE HAM PBA'S THEM TRIPLE A. M. THEM. DANDY SO WAS A PHASED APPROACH OF REMEMBER WARNED OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND I BELIEVE I'M A IT WAS PROBABLY. I THINK WITH A FOUR FIVE YEAR I'M TIMEFRAME. SO ONE OF THINGS THAT WE WANT TO DO NOT FACE APPROACH WAS LESSEN THE IMPACT -- TURNED TERMS OF A CUSTOMER SO OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS THEY DO A SUBSET OF TRANSACTIONS WE'RE GOING TO MODERNIZE THOSE FIRST AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH OUR NEXT PARTNERS AS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT. AUTO CLUBS THEY DO ANOTHER SUBSET OF TRANSACTIONS AND THEN WHEN WE DO ALL THE FULL SINCE WE OF TRANSACTIONS ARE FILLED OFFICES DO. A WE WILL BE ABLE TO QUICKLY ONE THE FIELD OFFICES AT IF WE DID ALL THE TRANSACTIONS ON THE FIELD OFFICES ADD UP FRONT AT THE SAME TIME. WOULD TAKE LONGER TO TO IT WOULD IMPACT THE FIELD OFFICES UP GREATLY IF WE STARTED WITH THEM SO WHERE TALK TARGETING WITH THE FIRST SUBSET OF TRANSACTIONS FOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION THE NOT SO UPSET. WERE OUR AUTO CLUBPARTNERS DO DO MORE SO THIS IS A FACED APPROACH SO WEEKEND I MODERNIZE OUR SYSTEM. THOUGH IT YOU'RE GONNA HEAR SOME TESTIMONY TOMORROW -- THAT DOG FROM FROM A PEOPLE TO WORK WITH US TECHNOLOGY FOR A LONGER TIME YOU GOT HERE. PHRASES LIKE OUT WE HAVE THE FORTY YEAR OLD DINOSAUR OF A TECHNOLOGICAL OPERATION IS THAT ACCURATE. YES IT IS. S. IT IS OUR TECHNOLOGY IS OLD AND WE ARE TOLD THAT WE ARE WORKING TO MODERNIZE IT WE DID ON THE DRIVER'S LICENSES AND THAT IS MODERNIZE BUT WE DEFTLY. WE STILL HAVE TO MODERNIZE THE FIN AND YES IT IS OLD. M. AND THAT THE A YOUR PARTNERS. OTHER TRIP WAYS IN THOSE. THOSE OUTSIDE PARTNERS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY ARE SLAVES TO YOUR COMPUTERS AND THAT WHEN YOU GO DOWN. THEY GO DOWN IS THAT TRUE. YES THEY ARE TIED TO ISIS AS WE HAVE OF STAFF THERE THEY THEY WORK ON STAY OPEN AS LONG AS THEY ARE THEY'RE OPEN ON WEEKENDS ARE OPEN ON HOLIDAYS TO SUPPORT THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR SYSTEMS. TO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR BEING HERE I REALLY DO OUT WERE REALLY TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT HOW DEEP AND WIDE THE PROBLEM IS. AND I I AM GRATEFUL THAT YOU ARE HERE AND OUT. TAKING A QUESTIONS FROM SOMEBODY WHO. I HAD I DON'T MEAN TO BE GRUMPY BUT I HAVE WE ALL. I JUST AFTER A THAT I HAVE I HAVE A I HAVE ON MY DESK -- FRIEND OF MINE THE ARAB WHO GAVE ME A FRONT WENT TO THE HARRY TRUMAN. LIBRARY AND IT HAS -- ON MY DESK THE BUCK STOPS HERE. I THINK I MAY WANT TO BEQUEATH THAT TO YOU I THINK THAT'S A RESPONSIBILITY THAT YOU FACE. THAT IS MY DEPARTMENT CORRECT BETTER AND YES THE BUCK STOPS WITH BUT YOU. THANK YOU I'M GLAD WE CAN ALL BE FORTHRIGHT TODAY THAT'S WONDERFUL MISTER FRAZIER. THANK YOU -- JEAN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND AGAIN -- AG. AGREEING THAT YEAH THE BUCK DOES STOP WITH YOU -- ONE OF THE THINGS IS IS THERE NOT A PROTOCOL IN PLACE THAT WHEN. WHEN YOU HAVE A ON OFFICES COMPLETELY IMPACTED WITH CUSTOMERS WERE YOU CAN HAVE A MOBILE RESPONSE THAT TO COME IN AND ACTUALLY? TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE OF AND AND ALLEVIATE THE SIX AND EIGHT HOUR WAITS WE'RE HEARING ABOUT IT IS I MEAN. DO YOU NEED TO DO THAT BUT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE MOBILE. SO THAT IF THERE IS AN IMPACT ON A CERTAIN DAY THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST. AND IT ACCOMMODATE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO TO GET SERVICE. YET SO WE HAVE EIGHT REGIONS WE HAVE REGIONAL OFFICES AND SO AS THE OFFICE REPORTING IF THERE IS A STAFF SHORTAGE THEY HAVE. SO THEY'RE MOVING EMPLOYEES AROUND AND SO WE HAVE A RELIEF TEAMS WE HAVE LIVE RELIEF MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES THAT GO OUT TO THESE OFFICES. AND SO WE ARE JUST STACKING UP THROUGHOUT THE MORNING WE MOVE STAFF AROUND AYE IN THESE LOCATIONS -- AND SOME DO TRAVEL A BIT OF A DISTANCE BECAUSE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE OFFICES WITH GREAT DISTANCES. WE DO I STAND STEP OUT IT JUST AND WE HAVE EIGHT REGIONS BUT HE SAID WE HAVE NO REGIONAL LINES FIVE OFFICERS ARE CLOSE BY. AND THEY CAN LOAN IF YOU STEP OVER TO ANOTHER OFFICE THOSE EMPLOYEES MOVE OVER. THANK YOU -- THIS QUESTIONS TO KINDA FINANCE DO YOU BELIEVE THE DMV HAS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. PARTMINER PART OF FINANCE -- OKAY TO IT OFF WITH THAT TO HIM SURVEYS -- DID THEY NOT PLAN WELL OR IS THE ADMINISTRATION OF PLANNING FOR THESE ISSUE ALSO -- SO THE FIRST VIRTUAL THE TWO HUNDRED AND THE NEW TWO HUNDRED THIRTY POSITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED ARM WILL CERTAINLY HELP -- AT WHEN WHEN WHEN THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL WAS PUT TOGETHER WE WENT THROUGH A LOT OF THE YOU KNOW ALL OF THE METRICS HOW MANY HOW MANY RENEWALS HOW MANY IDENTIFICATIONS HOW MANY -- FIRST TIME AND AND THE I THINK TO THEIR CREDIT OPPOSED ANY IT ISSUES THAT DEPARTMENT VEHICLES TRACKS THESE THINGS YOU KNOW VERY WELL. ARM AND SO I'M IN SOME CASES THE OTHER LEFT TO ESTIMATING. HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL COME IN AND WANT A I'M A REAL ID THE FIRST TIME? AND SO ARE. YOU KNOW THEY DID SOME RESEARCH AND CAME UP THE NUMBER AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE NUMBER THAT OF BUT OF CUSTOMERS ARE INTERESTED IN THAT. IS IS LOWER THAN WHAT WAS ANTICIPATED WASN'T ANTICIPATED. WAS THAT -- AS CUSTOMERS COME UP TO THE DESK. THEY DECIDE THAT THEY'VE YOU KNOW THE EIGHT BIT. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON AT THE DESK WANTS TO OFFER A REALLY DEEP. AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AND IN PART OF THE REQUESTED PART OF DMV'S IMPLANTATION -- THEY DID MEDIA BLASTS THEIR WEBSITE HAS PROVIDED INFORMATION THEY'VE PUT OUT MAILERS SO A AND MEN FEEL TO THEIR OFFICE AND FEAR YOU KNOW THEREFORE IN ANY AMOUNT OF TIME TO SEE. A POSTERS EXPLAINING WHAT REAL IDEAS AND WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO THESE OTHER STEPS WERE ALSO PART OF THEIR PROCESS. IN A IN PUTTING TOGETHER HOW WE GOING -- TO GET THIS OUT TO THE CUSTOMERS. AND SO ARM WITH THEY DIDN'T ANTICIPATE WAS IN OF THE FACT THAT I WAS STAYING ALL OF THOSE OTHER. YOU KNOW OUTLETS THERE WOULD STILL BE OTHER QUESTIONS ON ANAHIT THAT REALLY COMES OUT OF THAT THE MATHIS. NOT NOT THAT COMPLICATED -- AND THAT'S THE ONE THING I THINK THAT WELL UNDERESTIMATED. OKAY SO WHAT I'M SAGE. JERRY WHEN I SEE A BUDGET REQUEST OR ANY KIND OF BILL ANALYSIS WHEN DEAL IF HE GETS IT ENGAGED THEY ALSO PUT THEIR THEIR STAMP OF EITHER APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL. AND IT -- APPARENTLY. YOU GUYS WERE IN LINE WITH THE DMV THIS YEAR WITH. AND LEISURE WHAT'S CALLED THE OF THE REQUESTS WERE UNIT NOISE IN MY BEING MORE -- FATE YOU JUST FELL IN LINE WITH THE DMV AND JUST SAID OKAY THIS IS WHAT YOU GET -- BECAUSE AGAIN. OF WHEN I SEE THE DEAL WORTH MAKING ANALYSIS IS SOMETIMES VERY CONTRARY TO AN AGENCY OR A BILL REQUEST OF OUR BUDGET REQUEST SO -- I'M SEEING. THAT -- THEY NEED HELP [inaudible] OBVIOUSLY. AND AND WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF THERE WAS IT THERE WAS A DISASTER GOING ON IN THE PUBLIC BASICALLY SAYING. YOU KNOW THERE'S NO CUSTOMER SERVICE RIGHT NOW [inaudible] AND LACK OF MANPOWER -- THAT WHAT WAS A AN ESTIMATE. LOVE IT TOOK. IT OVER CONSTITUENT CALLS TO COME IN AND TELL US. AND THEN. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN SAN FRANCISCO TO HAVE TO STAND ON OF A LINE AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE DMV OFFICE TO TO TO TRY TO GET A RENEWAL -- YOU KNOW IT. WITH THESE AGENCIES BUTTON. I AM I'M AND I'M LOST FOR WORDS WHEN YOU KNOW THAT ALL THE SUDDEN. THERE IT HERE AFTER THE FACT AFTER THE BUDGET'S PASSED. AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT. I THINK WAS COOL OR WHAT THE REQUEST WAS COOL SO. I CAN EXPLAIN. PINNACLE BUT THE DEAL HAVE PUT RESPONSIBLE ALSO. MINNESOTA AND MANY THINK OF WE UNDERSTAND THAT -- WE WHEN WE GET THESE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS WE WORK THROUGH IT WITH DEPARTMENTS WE YOU KNOW WE QUESTION THEIR ASSUMPTIONS NAM. AND WHICH ARE TO MAKE SURE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REASONABLE AND TO FOR EXAMPLE IF IF AN APARTMENT WOULD COME IN AND SAY WELL WE'RE GONNA. BRING ASSUME THAT'S GONNA TAKE TEMAS TO DISCUSS THIS AND AND THEY DID HAVE ANY PUBLIC OUTREACH RIGHT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT ADDRESS AND US ARE TALKING ABOUT AN HOUR. IN OUR EVALUATION SO -- MID TERMS OF WETTON PARTNER OR VEHICLES CAME FORWARD WITH IN THE REQUEST WE DID TALK THROUGH ITS ALL PART OF OUR ANALYSIS AND DATA -- AND IN IT IT SEEMED REASONABLE AND I THINK OF YOU KNOW. BOTH APARTMENTS WE JUST MESSED THIS -- THIS ONE OTHER YOU KNOW MAJOR COMPONENT AND UP BUT WE YOU KNOW. WE DID UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS YOU KNOW. WILSHIRE MAKE MAKE ROOM FOR SOME RISK THAT YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE A STICKER SO WE PUT THIS PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE AND TO TO ALLOW US TO A DOWNTURN AND THE JUST -- IF FOR IF WE ARE WRONG ANYTHING. APPRECIATE THAT SO JEAN. HOW CAN WE HELP YOU? SO AND YOUR RIGHT NOW. RIVER IT'S A ROAD HOW CAN WE HELP YOU. SO WE WE DO APPRECIATE PREVIOUS LEGISLATORS APPROVALS TO AUGMENT OUR A BUDGETARY TO HIRE MORE STAFF -- WE DID NOT AND IT IS FATE AS THE PART FINANCES THEM OUT ITS CASE YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN A REAL ID TO OUR CUSTOMERS -- WE WOULD ASK THAT TO GET ADDITIONAL BUDGET AUTHORITY UP UP TO UP TO TWENTY SIX MILLION TO ALLOW US TO HIRE MORE STAFF. WHICH INSURANCE SHOULD HELP FURTHER ALLEVIATE THE WAIT TIMES AND WE WOULD PROVIDE A MONTHLY REPORTS LEGISLATIVE REPORTS TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. ABOUT WHATEVER STEAMY HAS UNDERTAKEN AND HOW OF THESE ARE REDUCING WAIT TIMES. SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT [inaudible] BUT I THINK YOU JUST SIX COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS. MY AYE MIKE. I BROUGHT A CONCERN AS THERE'S THERE'S SOME OF THIS DISCONNECT HIS A ONE THE ONE HAND YOU MONITOR REAL TIME. EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN EACH OF THE FIELD OFFICES. AND THE OTHER HAND THERE'S SOME DELAY IN ACTING. AND NOW WE'RE SEND NOW WE'RE SEEING THE WAIT TIMES NOW BEING SO BAD THAT YOU'RE NOW SENDING PEOPLE TO THESE FIELD OFFICES. WHY WASN'T THIS DONE EARLIER IN THE PROCESS IF YOU'RE TRACKING EVERYTHING REAL TIME AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON THE FIELD OFFICES WHY AREN'T YOU SENDING STAFF WHEN THEY NEED IT? SO WE ARE SAY THE STAFF AND WE WERE SLOW TO RESPOND TO THAT I AGREE I AGREE TO THAT. OF BY SENDING THE STAFF THEY'RE DOING NON PRODUCTION WORK UP TO THESE FIELD OFFICE WERE PUTTING THE TRAINED TECHNICIANS UP GORE TREES ONLINE HELPING THE CUSTOMERS. DON'T SEE ME BACK ON WORKING ON THE WINDOWS WE CAN PROCESS MORE TRANSACTIONS AND SEE CUSTOMERS AND SO I THE DIGITAL. AUTHORITY WILL HELP US GET MORE TRAIN OUR EMPLOYEES ON ON BOARD SO THAT WE CAN HELP THE CUSTOMERS AND SO -- YEAH WE WERE SLOW TO RESPOND TO GET HEADQUARTERS TO DO THE NON PRODUCTION WORK -- TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS AND WE ARE OUT WORKING FAST TO GET THE EMPLOYEES THAT -- WE HAVE OUT THERE IS ANOTHER -- HUNDRED SIXTY SIX WE HAVE THAT ALMOST ALL THOSE HIRED WE HOPE TO HAVE THE REST OF THIRTY WHEN THEY'RE HIRED AND THEN WITH ADDITIONAL LAST RIGHT NOW WE HAVE. IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE OF SIXTY MILLION THAT'S ANOTHER TWO TO THIRTY AND SO WE ARE WORKING ACTIVELY. AND TO GET THOSE EMPLOYEES HARD AS FAST AS WE CAN. BECAUSE I AND I THINK YOU THE I'M ASSUMING THOUGH AS THE OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY REAL ID DEADLINE AS THAT PROCHES THIS. I KNOW WE AUDIO IS NOT THE SOLE CONCERT PURPOSE OF EVERYTHING OTHER PROBLEMS AT THE DMV BUT THIS CHALLENGE IT WILL ONLY INTENSIFIES THAT CORRECT. AND MORE CUSTOMERS ARE COMING IN AND SO THIS IS WHERE IN TERMS OF THE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR MORE PEOPLE LIES WE WANT. TO AYE WE ARE MARCHING THE WAIT TIMES MARGIN LINES OUTSIDE WE NEED TO RAMP UP AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE EYES AS WE SEEK QUESTIONS COMING AND AND BE ABLE TO RAMP UP. FOR THAT. AND ALSO JUST TO ADD TO THAT AT IN REGARDS TO THE RELATED PROPOSAL WEEKS SUMMIT IN FRONT OF LEGISLATURE THERE'S ONLY THOSE FIRST TWO YEARS OF FUNDING WAS PROVIDED. AND SO WE WILL BE COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH THAT WITH ANOTHER PROPOSAL FOR THE ADDITIONAL YEARS SO DO YOU HAVE A PLAN IN TERMS OF HOW. YOU'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS TO ME DO YOU HAVE A PLAN. THAT JUST THE IS THAT WE'RE GONNA IMPLEMENT REAL ID OVER THE NEXT -- HERE'S NOT STAFF NOT JUST NEAR MONEY BUT WHAT ARE PROCESS HE'S ARE GOING TO BE. SO WE ARE LOOKING INTEREST BUDGET WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO GET CUSTOMERS OUR FIELD OFFICES OF WEAKENED -- OFFER OTHER OPTIONS ALTERNATIVE SERVICES. ALSO LOOKING AT WHERE WE LOOK AT SOME OTHER SOLUTIONS WHERE THE CUSTOM HAVE TO COME TO THE DMV. AND SO THAT WE DO NOT HAVE TO WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SEE MORE CUSTOMERS WERE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE -- FLESHING OUT RIGHT NOW AND WHERE WE COULD DO THAT AND SO WE HAVE SOME THINGS THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING WHAT SOME -- DISCUSSING INTERNALLY AND THEN UP WITH WE NEED TO WE MADE DO YOU NEED TO REST AT REQUEST AN EXPEDITED. PROCESS IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS TO GET A PROJECT STARTED A WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME THINGS IN TERMS OF WHERE WE COULD GET KEY -- CUSTOMERS WHO UP DO NOT NEED TO COME TO THE DMV I CAN'T TALK ABOUT WHAT THESE ARE AS YET BECAUSE IF I HAVE TO PUT A PROPOSAL OUT. I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF THE GAME BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT THOSE SOLUTIONS IN TERMS OF IN GETTING READY AS WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE ID CUSTOMERS. ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE CAN GET CUSTOMERS THAT DON'T NEED TO COME TO DEEMED READ TO DO MORE ONLINE SERVICES OR NOT HAVE TO COME TO THE OFFICE. BUT YOU'LL RELEASE THAT PLAN OR RELEASE WILL DISCUSS IT PUBLICLY CORRECTIVE WE KNOW THIS IS COMING YEAH OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTIES COMING. AND SO WILL WE GET AT LEAST SAID AND THE DETAILS OF A PLAN OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE ONE ALREADY BUT YET SO YOU KNOW WE ARE OUTLOOK EXPLORING SOME OF THESE THINGS -- WE ARE -- TALKING TO SOME VENDORS ABOUT -- WHAT THEY OFFER IN SO WE? THEN HOW IT WOULD IMPLEMENT THAT AND THEN WE WOULD -- GO FORWARD WITH THAT IT COULD BE A A PILOT COULD BE APPROVED THE CONCEPT TO SEE IF WE CAN DO THAT BUT THEN WE DO HAVE A PLAN. IS TO REDUCE THE CUSTOMER IS NOT HAVING TO COME TO THE DMV AND WE CAN HAVE THIS A MORE SERVICES A DONE OUTSIDE WITH OUR PARTNERS WE ARE WORKING WITH THAT TOO CAN WIN RELEASED BE ABLE TO SEE A PLAN OR AN ALLY ARE WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW -- SO WE WOULD COME BACK TO YOU ONCE WE HAVE THAT THAT DONE BUT WE'RE ART I DON'T UNDER DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW OKAY I WOULD JUST SAY TO THE CHAIR OF MY MY CONCERN IS BEFORE WE START GIVING MORE MONEY I THINK WE SHOULD. BEGIN TO SEE A PLAN FIRST AND WHAT THAT WOULD WOULD ENTAIL BUT I JUST LAST QUESTION WOULD YOU BE WOULD YOU BE OPEN ARE WELCOME REVIEW BY. SOME OUTSIDE ENTITY TO REVIEW THE PROCESS HE'S AND HOW THINGS OPERATE IN EUROPE AND YOUR OPERATION. SO -- YOU KNOW WE ARE OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER SO -- WE ARE YOU WE ALL THINK ANYBODY AT GIVING US A SUGGESTIONS. BUT JUDGING AUDITOR REVIEW IF YOU PROCESS IF YOU HAVE THAT AND I DON'T WOULD REQUIRE US TO REDIRECT THE RESOURCES REQUIRED TO HAVE DEDICATED TO REDUCING THE WAIT TIMES AND SO THEN AND IF ANY AUDIT YOU HAVE TO PULL OUT A DOCUMENT YOU HAVE. TO A DIFFERENT AS PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON DIFFERENT PROJECTS WOULD BE REDIRECTED TO AT RESPONDING TO AN AUDIT AND THAT WOULD PULL OUR RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE WORKING. AYE AND THE TEAM THAT WE HAVE TOGETHER RIGHT NOW WORKING TO REDUCE THE WAIT TIME WE WOULD -- HAVE TO REDIRECT THOSE RESOURCES IF WE HAD TO RESPOND TO NOT AND THAT WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE WORKING ON THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE WAIT TIME. AYE AYE AMENABLE WEARS YOU OUT BUT A YEAR VERY HESITANT TO NOT IT. I IT WOULD WE DIRECTED WE WOULD IT STRAIN OUR RESOURCES OKAY. GEN I WILL FOLLOW THAT UP. I HAVE TO FOLLOW THAT UP. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN EXECUTIVE STAFF FROM YOU. AN ENTIRE EXECUTIVE STAFF. THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE YOUR HANDS ON AND ALL THE INFORMATION. AT YOUR DISPOSAL. YOU SHOULD BE HAVING THAT INFORMATION IN FRONT OF YOU RIGHT NOW. AN AUDIT IS MERELY GOING TO ASK YOU TO DIVULGE AND DISCLOSE AND REPORT. SO TO SUGGEST THAT AN AUDIT IN ORDER TO DIG DEEP DOWN INTO WHAT YOU'RE DOING BY A COMPETENT AUDITOR WHO HAS. LOTS OF HISTORY IN FINDING AREAS OF PROBLEMS AND HELPING US SOLVE THEM. IS IN YOUR JUDGMENT. A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU CAN DELIVERED THE BASIC INFORMATION THAT A DEPARTMENT. DIRECTOR OUGHT TO IMMEDIATELY HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL. YOU MUST EXPLAIN I I DID NOT SAY WAS A PROBLEM LIKE TO SAID IT WOULD BE REDIRECTION RESOURCE IS WE WOULD PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION THAT WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE. THE OTHER WELL EXCUSE ME BUT THE IMPLICATION WAS THAT THAT THAT THE REDIRECTION OF RESOURCES WOULD BE AT THE COUNTER. IT WOULD BE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT A THE THE THE THE SITUATION. ON THE GROUND AND IN THE FIELD OFFICES AND I'M SUGGESTING TO YOU THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION IT SHOULD BE READILY AVAILABLE AND HOW. COMPLYING WITH REPORTS UPON HOW YOU DO WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU DO IT HOW MUCH IT COST WHAT IF THE IMPEDIMENTS. WHAT CAN WE DO? AT A BETTER. YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS THIS MOMENT SO IS IT I DID NOT SEE A VIEW REDIRECTION. WE WOULD NEVER REDIRECT THE THAT OUR FRIEND BUT SERVING THE EYEBROW SLIP WILK IT IS A REDIRECTION OF RESOURCES INTERNALLY AT HEADQUARTERS ARE WORKING ON TO STILL BE BASICALLY TALKING ABOUT YOUR YOUR EXECUTIVES GOING HAVE DOUBLE THE MORE WORK TO DO. THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING NON NOT SAYING THAT WE THEY ALL WORK HARD IS JUST REDIRECTION THOSE RESOURCES WERE WORKING ON THIS AND THEN GO WORKING WITH ANY MONEY THAT IS LOOKING. AND AS AN AUDITOR [inaudible] ALRIGHT [inaudible] MASON [inaudible] POLITICAL. YOU KNOW I I WILL SAY THIS ON ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT -- HAVING RUN A CITY DEPARTMENT WHERE I WAS AUDITED -- FOUR YEARS IN A ROW BY FOUR DIFFERENT AGENCIES -- WHERE INFORMATION IS REQUESTED AUDITS TO TAKE TIME THEY'RE NOT YOU HAVE -- HAVING SAID THAT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE FULLY UNDERSTAND AND WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH AND I DO AGREE WITH MR FONG THAT WE DO NEED. TO HAVE A A A PLAN OUR WAY DOWN THE HALL AND NOT WAIT TO GET TO MY QUESTION A MINUTE LET NOT MISS BAKER GO FIRST BUT ALL OF YOUR HOUSE BUT IT WOULD ACHIEVING MORE TIME AND I I PROMISE OUT AWARENESS. IT IT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT AMOUNTS [inaudible] TO BEFORE YOU. WHAT AMOUNTS? TO YOUR OWN AUDIT [inaudible] I THEN WHAT ARE YOUR EXECUTIVES. RESPONSIBLE FOR IN OTHER WORDS THIS SHOULD BE READILY OF THE AND YOU SHOULD BE AUDITING. YOURSELF AT AS A STANDARD PROCEDURE.

SO I'VE BEEN OUT OF VISITING A BEEN TO REGION ONE WHICH IS THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OFFICES -- AND I'VE BEEN OUT TO REGION'S SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT THOSE A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I WAS IN THE MONTEBELLO OFFICE I WAS -- DEAF I WAS IN THE SAN MARCOS OFFICE SO I HAD BEEN AT THOSE OFFICES ARE DEBBIE DIRECTOR OF THE OF FIELD OPERATIONS SHE HAS BEEN OUT IN VISITING THOSE OFFICE I HAVE A LIST OF THOSE OFFICES.

I HAVE BEEN OUT TO THOSE OFFICES THANK YOU A AYE AYE WAS INVALID IT MORE IT WHEN. WHEN WERE YOU LAST AT THOSE OFFICES AND I HAVE TO GO BACK I WAS THAT -- MONTEBELLO PROBABLY. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO -- BONTA CREEK -- WALNUT CREEK WAS LAST MONTH AND CONCORD I WAS OUT THERE -- DEFTLY I WAS AT SAN MARCO'S PALLID MONTH BEFORE I WAS AT EUREKA WEAVERVILLE AND CRESCENT CITY A LAST WEEK. VISITING THOSE OFFICES WHEN OF YOUR AT ONE AND WE ARE ALSO AT THE END. THANK YOU SORRY I'M SORRY WHEN YOU WERE AT WALNUT CREEK FOR EXAMPLE CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO US WHAT YOU SAW HOW LONG YOU WERE THERE WHAT YOU OBSERVED WHAT YOU SAW WHAT YOU DID THERE. A I DID OBSERVE -- OF CUSTOMERS WAITING OUTSIDE WE DID WALK IN OF WE TALKED OF OFFICE MANAGER. AND AND SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE ASK ALL OFFICES DEFAULT WE'RE NOT BEING FOLLOWED. AND THEY WERE NOT TOO YOUNG LYING IN SO DEFINITELY WE FOLLOW UP WE BRING EXTRACTING BACK OUT TO TALK TO THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR FOLLY BEST PRACTICES AND YES I WAS DISAPPOINTED -- THAT -- AT BEST BUY. WHAT WERE THE BEST? WE'RE NOT BEING FOLLOWED I HAVE BEEN A PERSON OUTSIDE TRIAGE IN LINE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY AND I DID HAVE ALL THE RIGHT POT PAPERWORK IF NOT. GETTING THE CUSTOMERS IN AS FAST AS THEY CAN OUT WE DID SEE THAT CUSTOMER THERE WERE -- EMPTY CHAIRS IN THE LOBBY AND THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GETTING THOSE CUSTOMERS AND INSIDE THE OFFICE AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN YET I DID OBSERVE THAT WE TALK TO THE DEAD TO THE MANAGER IN THAT THESE ARE THINGS I NEED TO DO -- IS NOT ACCEPTED FOR BECAUSE MISTER WAIT OUTSIDE OUT IF THERE ARE YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO GET THE CUSTOMER ISN'T AS FAST AS THEY CAN. AND THE STRIKE TEAM YOU DEPLOY IT SOUNDS VERY GOOD TO HAVE A STRIKE TEAM BUT THAT WAS STRAIGHT WHO WHO ARE THEY AND WINNER THEY GOING TO BE DEPLOYED TO GO CHECK F. THE FOLLOW UP IS HAPPENED. SO WE HAVE UP PET WHERE STAFF IN FIELD OPERATIONS -- THEY HAVE ARE FORMALLY WORK IN A FIELD OFFICE THEY I UNDERSTAND AND KNOW HOW FEEL OFF ON OFFICE OPERATES. OF THEY WILL GET DEPLOYED AS ANGLETON OFFICE OF A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AT LOOK LIKE WE HAVE STRIKE TEAMS IN PLACE IN CENTRAL VALLEY AND IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA THAT ARE COMING OUT OF OUR REGIONAL OFFICES -- WHEN WE SEE THAT IN OFFICE IS HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WE WILL DEPLOY THEM -- AS SOON AS WE GET RID OF THAT. I THINK U. S. REFERRAL BUT MORE TO THE ONE THE CREEK OFFICE WHEN HIS THAT STRIKE TEAM. SET UP TO GO TO AN OFFICE LIKE THAT WHERE YOU SAW BEST PRACTICES NOT BEING FOLLOWED -- I ACTUALLY I WAS THAT WE WERE THERE ARE MAKING PHONE CALLS AND SAYING THAT -- A WE OBSERVING THIS BECAUSE AND IMMEDIATELY YOU NEED TO BRING SOMEBODY DOWN HERE TO TAKE A LOOK AND AND REINFORCE -- THE BEST PRACTICES SO WE'RE ON THE PHONE TALKING SAYING WE NEED TO GET SOMEBODY OUT HERE IMMEDIATELY AND I'VE BEEN OUT -- WHEN I HEARD COMPLAINTS REGARDING AND ANOTHER OFFICE CALL THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND SAID YOU NEED TO GO OUT THERE TOMORROW AND SHE WAS OUT THERE OKAY? I'M JUST I UNDERSTAND YOU CALLED RIGHT AWAY DO YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE EXPECTED THE STRIKE TEAM IS GOING TO GO AYE I GET THE CALLS ACTED TO GO OUT THE NEXT THE NEXT DAY OKAY -- I I WILL BE VERY HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU TO FIND OUT IF THE STRIKE TEAM. HAS GONE BACK TO ON THE CREEK UP AS ONE OF THOSE LOCATIONS AND THE REASON I'M ASKING THESE QUESTIONS AND A FEW OTHERS THAT I HAVE IS THAT YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE Q.. AND THE WAIT TIMES BEARS RELATION AT ALL TO REALITY BOTH IN WALNUT CREEK AND EVERY OTHER OFFICE. IT WAS MENTIONED IN THAT THE STOCK THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET FROM ME IS GOING TO BE FOLKS WHO WAITED FOR HOURS OUTSIDE. BEFORE THEY GOT IN THE DOOR. I'VE GOT SO MANY WHO WAITED THREE HOURS TO GET A TICKET. JUST TO GET A TICKET. AND THEN THEY WAITED FIVE HOURS AFTER THAT FOR THEIR TICKET TO BE CALLED [inaudible] AND THAT DOESN'T BEAR ANY RELATION AT ALL TO THE FIVE MINUTES TO CHECK I THINK HEARD FIVE MINUTES TO CHECK IF SOMEONE'S GOT THE REAL ID PAPERS. THAT ZERO RELATION. SO IT IS I'M VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE RESPONSES YOU GAVE TO MISTER PATTERSON THE OTHER MEMBERS COMMITTEE ABOUT THE Q. TIME IN THE QUEUE SYSTEM IN THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THAT. HOT THAT YOU WE ARE LOOKING INTO AUDIT VERY CAREFULLY AT HOW THAT BEARS NO RELATION AT ALL TO WHAT CONSTITUENTS ARE EXPERIENCING A WHAT'S ON THE GROUND THERE'S NO FIVE MINUTE WAIT TO HAVE YOUR DOCUMENTS CHECKED. NOW ALIVE IT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE IS A ABOUT THE REAL ID. SO LIVE IN YOUR INTRODUCTORY REMARKS ABOUT AND THIS IS A BIG PART OF THE ISSUE. I'M THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU. TO EXPLAIN FOR US PLEASE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS WHERE YOU THINK -- IT'S NOT REAL IDEA THERE'S OTHER PROBLEMS THAT IT HAPPENED. BECAUSE THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT REAL IDEA I'D LIKE YOU TO ANSWER TO SAY WHAT ELSE YOU THINK IS CAUSING -- INSUFFICIENT AND ADEQUATE SERVICE AT THE DMV. SO WE ARE. IN THE PROCESS WE HAVE WE WANT TO CREATE EFFICIENCIES SO ENTERED DURING THAT LED TRUCK DRIVERS LICENSE APPLICATION FOR LOUIS INTEGRATE THAT INTO A DRIVERS LICENSE SYSTEM IN SEPTEMBER. THAT WILL CREATE EFFICIENCIES WERE OUR TECHNICIAN DOES NOT HAVE TAKE KEYED INFORMATION BY NOW THEY KEY ON THAT END THAT AGREED AND EFFICIENCY WILL MAKE IT BETTER. SO WE ARE OUT WORKING ON THAT. WE HAVE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALSO I SAID THAT -- FOR THEY QUEUING SYSTEM WE ARE GOING SO THAT YOU ALL KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'RE COMING UP FOR YOUR Q. TICKET THAT YOU CAN EITHER GO AND IF YOU'RE CLOSE BY YOU CAN GO GET. SOMETHING TO DRINK OR COME BACK THAT YOU'LL BE NOTIFIED SO THAT YOU. CAN GO OUT AND NOT AND THEN COME BACK WHEN YOU NEED TO SO THAT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WE'RE DEATHLY WORKING ON ADDITIONAL AND THE TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO WEDNESDAY MORNING TRAIN EVERY EVERY WEEK. HOW WE DO REFRESHER TRAINING IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF FOR THE REAL ID REFRESHER TRAINING ON JUST PROCESS AND PROCEDURES AND SO -- AS WE GET AND YOU EMPLOYEES THEY HAVE TO LEARN THE SYSTEM THAT CAN YOU LEARN WHAT OUR PROCESSES ARE -- AS THEY GET MORE TIME ON THE JOB THEY WILL GET PROFICIENT WERE PROFICIENT AND WOULD BE ABLE TO PROCESS MORE CUSTOMERS SO. I THAT'S WHERE THERE ISN'T A LEARNING CURVE GET OF SPEED DEPOSITS ARE TRANSACTIONS BUT WITH THE NEW EMPLOYEES AND GETTING THEM -- TRAIN AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN AND THEY GET MORE PROFICIENT AT THE PROCESS THEY'RE GOING TO GET MORE I'VE BE ABLE TO PROCESS CUSTOMERS FASTER. I WOULD AND I WOULD EXPECT THOSE WELL ADJUSTED IT THERE ARE OTHER AREAS WHERE -- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE REAL ID AND I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AND THAT IS THE CUP THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS AREN'T JUST ABOUT WAITING IN THE SCORCHING HEAT WAITING TO GET LINES IT'S THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THEY RECEIVE WHEN THEY ARRIVE. AND IT'S THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ARE TREATED -- IT IS SOMETIMES THE MOST COMMON SENSE POINTS ABOUT YOU GOT A ROOM FULL OF CHAIRS AND AIR CONDITIONING AND YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE. YEAH AND SO WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR OUR EMPLOYEES WE WANT TO GET ALL THE CUSTOMERS WAIT OUTSIDE AS I OBSERVE WHEN I WAS AT WANT TO CREATE INSIDE THE OFFICE. AND BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN IN AIR CONDITIONED OFFICE GREATLY I RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE ARE WORKING TO GET THOSE CUSTOMERS INSIDE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN THANK YOU SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS FOR THEIR COMPLAINTS YOU'LL READ HERE AND I REALLY STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT IF IT'S A LOT. OF READING AND THAT'S JUST PART THAT YOU READ THESE TONIGHT BEFORE THE HEARING TOMORROW CHEN LACK. A AND E'S BECAUSE YOU'LL SEE THAT IT'S NOT TIME AT THE DMV FOR MY REAL ID -- SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE HAPPENING IS ERRORS THAT ARE CAUSED BY THE DMV. THAT CAUSES SOMEONE TO COME IN MULTIPLE TIMES YOU'LL FIND EXAMPLES IN AT LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO IDENTIFY THOSE -- AT WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING IN BECAUSE THEY WIN THEY WENT THROUGH THE LONG PROCESS AND THE VETERAN STICKER THAT THEIR REQUEST IT WASN'T PUT ON THERE OR THE DONOR STICKER WASN'T PUT ON THERE. OR THEY WERE NEVER SENT. OF THEIR LICENSE SO THEY HAD TO GO BACK. AND START THE PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN AND THE EMPLOYEE SAID TO THEM WILL THAT HAPPEN SOMETIME. THE PLOT IN PLEASANTON CALIFORNIA THAT HAPPENED SOMETIME -- SO IT'S THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT CONSTITUENTS RECEIVING NOT JUST HOW LONG THEY ARE WAITING WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO GET A REAL IMPRESSION OF THE LEVEL OF SERVICE PROBLEMS AND FIXING THAT. THAT ISN'T HAS TO DO WITH THE CUE SYSTEM OR OTHERWISE. SO WE ARE IN NIGHT I AM MEETING WITH OFFICE MANAGERS -- TO LEARN FROM THEM WHAT THEIR CHALLENGES ARE AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE THAT AND AGAIN THE COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE YOUR A LOOK THROUGH THOSE AND COME UP WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THEM BUT I WOULD IF WE WILL LOOK AT THEM. TONIGHT AND BE READY TO RESPOND TO THOSE THANK YOU AT ANOTHER AREA IS AND I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT FOLKS WHO THEY'RE STILL GONNA BE LONG LINES THAT WE HEAR I'VE REPEATED. STORIES OF ELDERLY. WHO ARE REQUIRED AFTER AGE SEVENTY TO GO INTO THE DMV WHO ARE STANDING IN LINE? FOR HOURS ONE OF THEM IS FROM A WOMAN WHO FELT SHE FAINTED WHILE SHE WAS WAITING IN LINE. AND SHE WAS TOLD BY THE STAFF THAT IF SHE WERE TO LEAVE EMERGENCY CREWS CAME. IF SHE WERE TO LEAVE TO BE TREATED SHOULD HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE DMV ANOTHER DAY. AND SO SHE INSISTED THAT THE EMERGENCY PERSONNEL TREAT HER THERE SO SHE COULD STAND LINE -- MULTIPLE A OF ADDITIONAL STORIES OF A A FAMILY WHO SAW GENTLEMAN ELDERLY JOHN IN THE CORNER LOOKING CONFUSED AND ON THE VERGE OF TEARS AND HE SAID I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR HOURS THEY TOLD ME TO JUST WAIT RIGHT HERE THEY WOULD COME GET ME. AND NO ONE IS HELPING HIM GET INTO A LINE NO ONE IS TRYING TO HELP THEM SO AND THERE ARE NO CHAIRS FOR PEOPLE SO IN THE MOST IMMEDIATE TERM I'M ACTUALLY CONCERNED AS MISTER GIPSON WAS IN A DIFFERENT ABOUT THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS WERE SITTING AND WAITING. WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE WHICH YOU SAW CLEARLY ALL THAT CREEK? TOO BIG AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THEM WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP YOU ADDRESS THAT AS WELL. SO WE ARE FOCUSING ON MANY FRONTS AND ONE IS DEATHLY GET THE THE CUSTOMERS INSIDE AND SO WHEN YOU I DID SEE AND WANT TO CREATE THE LINE. OUT WE ARE GETTING REPORTS EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR HOW MANY COOPER WAY IN LINE AND OR FOR SEEN YOU NEED TO GET YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON CHALLENGING IS ADDRESSING THAT. AND THEY ARE -- WE ARE SAYING THERE AT RIGHT QUICKLY BECAUSE AGAIN WE UNDERSTAND THEY CANNOT STAND OUTSIDE VERY LONG IN THE HEAT. SO CANADIAN WORKERS ARC OF WITH OUR EMPLOYEES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES ARE AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT TRAINING. AND UNDERSTAND IF LIKE I SAID IF I NEED TO GET A STRIKE TEAM OUT THERE TOO OUT WORK THAT OFFICE TO ADDRESS THOSE THINGS WE WILL DO THAT THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- ADDITIONALLY WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER ENTITIES LIKE AYE AUTO CLUB'S. I'M ONE OF THEIR CONCERNS A CONSTITUENT HAS IS THEY WERE ABLE TO DEAL WITH AN ISSUE BY JUST PAIN FIFTY BUCKS TO JOIN AN AUTO CLUB WHAT ABOUT THE CONSTITUENTS WHO DON'T HAVE THAT. IT ARE YOU SITTING UP RELATIONSHIPS AND LOOKING AT I PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT DON'T REQUIRE BECOMING A MEMBER OF AN AUTO CLUB. BUT REQUIRED AT ALLOW THE ABILITY OF YOU TO GET SERVICE SOMEWHERE ELSE SIMILAR TO HOW I GO TO A POSTAL ANNEX AND SHIP MY PACKAGE THERE INSTEAD OF WAITING IN LINE AT THE POST OFFICE. SO WE HAVE OUR SELF SERVICE TERMINALS THOSE A WE DON'T KNOW IT AT WORK BECAUSE WE CAN GO IF YOU HAVE A SIMPLE VIC REDUNDANT VEHICLE REGISTRATION WE KNOW ALL YOU CAN DO THAT. THERE AND I'VE IT LOCATED AND SIXTY OUR FIELD OFFICES UP CURRENTLY IN FORTY RETAIL LOCATIONS WERE GRINNING BURKE STANDING THAT. AND THAT'S IN TERMS OF WHERE -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THAT WE HAVE SOARED THAT COST RIGHT NOW AND SO WE ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND THAT PROGRAM. AND WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AND SEE IF THERE'S OTHER PARTNERS THAT WE COULD LOOK TO IN TERMS OF WHERE WE CAN OFFER SUMMIT AT NINE AND I IT WE WOULD WELCOME ANY SUGGESTIONS THAT IF YOU KNOW OF ANYBODY. THAT COULD OFFER THAT SERVICE I'M OR COUPLE A AN ABOUT TURN FINALLY TO THE AREA WHERE YOU DO IT. VERY HONESTLY WELCOME SUGGESTIONS SO I APPRECIATE THAT. I HEARD MY THINGS YOU MENTION IN YOUR TESTIMONY IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE LIKE A RELY DE AREA AND THEN. MAYBE OF A DIFFERENT LINE OR A DIFFERENT Q. FOR THINGS THAT CAN BE MUCH FASTER TO GET WHETHER IT'S A DISABLED PLACARD OR AT TEMPORARY DISABLED PLACARD OR AGAIN VETERAN STICKER SOME OF THE OTHER POINTS THAT HAPPENED. WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR MAKING THIS DISTINCTION HAVE QUICK? EASY I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT SEVEN HOURS IN LINE FOR TWO MINUTES OF SERVICE -- THAT IS HAPPENING NOW THAT THAT THAT INSTRUCTIONS ALREADY WENT OUT AND THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING IN REAL TIME TODAY. WHERE CUSTOMERS TO HAVE A QUICK TRANSACTION ARE PULLED OUT AND SET TO THAT EXPEDITE WIND UP CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE MORE HAVE HOW THAT'S WHEN YOU SAY IT'S HAPPENING TODAY? YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A DMV PERSON GO TO A PERSON AND WHAT IS YOUR THE DMV IS THAT ARE. YOU ARE JUST HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING A GROUP TOGETHER SEVERAL PLACARD I DO YOU NEED TO YOUR PICKING UP YOUR YOUR SPECIALTY LICENSE PLATE -- YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO GET YOUR VEHICLE RECORD OR IDENTIFYING THE TYPE OF SERVICE THAT THEY NEED AND WE CAN IDENTIFY ONES ARE A QUICK EASY TRANSACTION THEY'RE BEING SENT TO THE EXPEDITE WINDOW. DOT PART THAT TRIAGE PROCESS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER YES MIGHT MY HOPE IS THAT WHAT YOUR DESCRIPTION IS OF IT WILL BEAR MUCH MORE -- THAT IS ARE IN RELATION TO THE WENT REALLY ENDS UP HAPPENING ON THE GROUND THAT YOU ONLY FIND OUT IF YOU'RE OUT IN ABOUT A POTENTIALLY. WITH THE AUDIT -- BECAUSE THAT IS NOT WHAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING. I WHAT WHAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE FIVE MINUTE YOU KNOW CHECK TO SEE IF YOU HAVE THE REAL IDEA THERE'S TESTIMONY AS WE HEAR FROM FOLKS WHO WERE ASKED SEVEN TIMES. SEVEN DIFFERENT DMV EMPLOYEES WENT TO CHECK IF THE HAVE ALL THE REAL ID DOCUMENTS THEY NEEDED. I'M SO ON THE SUGGESTIONS LIST IS TO MAKE SURE IF SOMEONE'S DOING THAT YOU'RE BEING EFFICIENT ABOUT IT IT'S ONE PERSON IS CHECKING YOUR DOING IT EARLY IN THE LINE. YOU'RE GETTING IT RESOLVED AND NOT MULTIPLE. CHECKS AND MULTIPLE EFFORTS TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE DUPLICATION OF EFFORT ON THAT IS IS AN ISSUE CYPRESS SHAPE THE TRIAGE AND THE DESCRIPTION OF IS VERY GOOD BUT WHAT. WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND IS SEVEN PEOPLE ASKING THE SAME QUESTION OF SOMEONE AS ARE GOING THROUGH THEIR SEVEN HOUR WAIT. IDEALLY I DID HEAR THAT FOR AND SO WHAT WE DID IS THAT THEY ARE GIVING A A A CARD THAT SAYS YOU HAVE BEEN CHECKED YOU HAVE YOUR REQUIRED DOCUMENTS YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO DO IS GO STRAIGHT THOUGH WHEN YOU GET TO THE START YUBA YOU'LL BE ISSUE. YOUR SERVICE TICKET SO WE DID HEAR THAT RIGHT AND THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE ARE BEING CHECKED MULTIPLE TIMES AND THEY HAVE THE SAME DOCUMENTS A SO THE SPEED UP THE PROCESS IS. YOU BEEN LOOKED AT YOU HAVE THE CARD IT'S IDENTIFIED YOU HAVE ALL YOUR DOCUMENTS AND THEN JUST ISSUED A TICKET TO SPEED THINGS UP. AND AND THE AYE ON THE SUGGESTION LESS AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU'VE TRIED THIS ALREADY AND AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T TAKE VERY MUCH DOLLARS FROM. A BUDGET TO DO. I WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE Q. TIMES AT THAT WERE SEEN ON THE GROUND ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'RE REPORTING ON YOUR WEBSITE YOU READ THE TESTIMONIALS OF FOLKS WHO ARE IN LINE FOR THEIR FIFTH HOUR. AND IT SAYS USE ONLY ONE HOUR WAIT HERE AND PLEASANT OFFICE. ONE OF THE AREAS IS ALSO HOW LONG ONCE THEY GET IN LINE AT DISNEYLAND FIGURE THIS OUT A LONG TIME AGO. AT THIS POINT IN THE LINE YOU'RE GOING TO WAIT THIS LONG. JUST LIKE YOU GOING TO AN APPLE STORE RIGHT NOW AND THEY ARE TRIAGE IN PEOPLE AND THEY ARE DOING THE TAXED AND CALLING YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN GO BACK TO WORK INTO WHATEVER IT IS. WHAT ARE YOU? I'VE YOU ALREADY LOOKED AT THOSE EFFORTS ANY MENTION THE TEXT ONE BUT THAT HERE'S HOW LONG IT IS GOING TO TAKE YOU TO BE IN LINE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN. A ASSESS WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. SO AS A AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ARE WE ARE -- EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR I IDENTIFYING HOW LONG PEOPLE ARE WAITING -- IT SO THAT WE ARE GIVE VERY GIVING A A DOCUMENT WHICH THEY WILL YOU PLEASE MARK WHAT TIME THEY'RE AT AND THEN WHEN THEY GET TO THE STAR HE WINDOW THAT IS OF REPORTED TIME HOW LONG THE WAIT IS OUTSIDE. OF WE'RE WORKING TO TRY TO DETERMINE HOW WE CAN POST THAT OUR WEBSITE SO GIVES AS A SEVERE PATTERSON MENTIONED WE ONLY REPORT WHAT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO PROCESS THE TRUTH. GET TO THE SERVICE WINDOW WE DO WANT TO REPORT HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THE STAR HERE WINDOW AND HOW LONG THAT THAT WAIT TIME ISN'T MINE. DEADLY DEADLY AT DISNEYLAND HAS TO DO THAT THEY GIVE YOU. CHAIRMAN HALL ON YOUR WEIGHT IS AND US SO WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. OKAY AND FINALLY ON THE COMPUTER OUTAGES BECAUSE THIS IS DATA THAT I AGREE WITH -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON THESE ARE ACTUALLY ANSWERS THAT SOMEONE AT THE TABLE SHOULD HAVE ANSWERS. TO AB ONE OF THE TESTIMONIALS YOU HAVEN'T HERE'S HOW SOMEONE FOR TWO DAYS TRIED TO GET AN APPOINTMENT ONLINE. BUT THEY COULDN'T BECAUSE FOR TWO DAYS. THERE WAS AN OUTAGE SO THEY CALLED THE DMV AND AFTER WAITING ON THE PHONE FOR ONE POINT FIVE HOURS THEY GOT A LIVE PERSON HE SAID TO COME INTO THIS LOCATION HERE'S ANY MAJOR APPOINTMENT. THE STORY WILL CONTINUE HOW IT TOOK THEM THREE HOURS TO GET. A TICKET FIVE HOURS ONCE THEY GOT A TICKET AND SO ON BUT THE OUTAGES OUR EXTENSIVE FROM WHAT. AYE AM HEARING FROM CONSTITUENTS AND WE WOULD EXPECT YOU AS WHERE THE BUCK STOPS TO KNOW. WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THOSE? AS WELL AS WHAT IS THE REAL TIME CUE AYE WEIGHTS AND HOW THE SYSTEM IS WORKING. BECAUSE WHAT WHAT THIS WILL TELL YOU IS IT'S THEIR SUBSTANTIAL OUTAGES OUTAGES AND THEY'RE HAPPENING FREQUENTLY AND IT'S COMPLETELY SHUTTING DOWN THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO SELF HELP. A MUCH MORE. THANK YOU I LOOK FOR DISNEY WITH YOU TOMORROW. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. YES THIS IS MEANT QUITE AN INTERESTING -- DISCUSSION IN CONVERSATION HERE AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF YOU KNOW ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS I FACES AS I LISTEN TO EVERYONE I GUESS I'M I'M PROBABLY ELATED. THAT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES ARE HAVING SUCH POOR SERVICE. UP BECAUSE THE MOST POOR COMMUNITIES AWAITS HAVE BEEN FOUR AND FIVE HOURS AT THE DMV. UP I'VE SELDOM GOING TO THE DMV BUT THE LAST TIME I WAS IN WHICH IS ABOUT FIVE SIX OUT YEARS AGO US FOR FIVE SIX HOURS IT TOOK ME. ABOUT FIVE HOURS TO GET SOMETHING SIMPLE DONE SO IT IMPORT COMMUNITIES WITHOUT AND KNOW THAT AND IN FACT -- TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT MOST OF US SELDOM GO TO OUR DMV AND I GO TO THE ONE IN OF LET MYSELF OR HER SOMEWHERE IN POWER WAY. WHERE I KNOW THAT THE SERVICE IS BETTER AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS BETTER AND FASTER SO THE FACT THAT WE'RE ALL NOW EXPERIENCING THE PAIN IS GOOD BECAUSE THEN WILL GET SOMETHING DONE? ABOUT DMV BECAUSE BEEN ONE OF THE AGENCY OF NIGHTMARE AND MOST COMMUNITIES THAT POOR. OF EITHER BECAUSE OF THE LONG NOT ONLY THE LONG LINES BUT OFTENTIMES WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE POOR SERVICE. IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK THERE AND I THINK THAT HAS TO BE SOME WORK DONE ON THAT IN TERMS OF PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVE AN ATTITUDE. OF OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHO COME INFILL LIKE BR BOTHER TO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK THERE AND IN FACT THE LAST TIME I WAS IN SOMEONE SAID -- I THINK YOU CALLED THE FOURTH THAT TIME FOUR THIRTY FIVE O'CLOCK THEY SIT WAITED THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE AND YOU'LL SEE WILL ASK THAT WILL NEVER GET OUT OF HERE BECAUSE HE DIED WHEN IN AT NOON AND IT WAS ALMOST FIVE INNOCENT WILL NEVER GET OUT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH. TIME TO WAIT ON ALL OF US AND THEY SAID WATCH AND SEE THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE THE TIME WAS OVER ALL OF THESE PEOPLE APPEARED FROM SOMEWHERE OUT OF THE OTHER ROOMS WHO WOULD DOING WHATEVER. AND THEY ALL CAME IN AND SURE ENOUGH WE ALL GOT OUT IN TIME FOR BY THE GET OFF WORK ON TIME. SO I BEFRUGAL AS THE IF WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE BEEN OUT EARLIER YEAR UP HOURS EARLIER IF EVERYONE HAD BEEN BASICALLY ARE MOST OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN CUSTOMER SERVICE. SO I THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS IS AS MOST FOLKS ARE FEELING THE FRUSTRATION BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONE AGENCY THAT PROBABLY EVERY CALIFORNIAN TOUCHES. THE ONE AGENCY ALL OF US DON'T NECESSARILY DEAL WITH WEB WELFARE AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES BUT WE OUGHT NOT HAVE TO HAVE SOME FORM OF ID. AND THAT COMES FROM THE ENVY WHATEVER IT IS WE ALL HAVE TO GO THERE SO I I NOT ELATED THE TROLL IN PAIN WITH ME BUT OBVIOUSLY IT IT GIVES ME GREAT COMFORT TO KNOW THAT. AS A RESULT OF ALL THE COMMUNITY SCREAMING THAT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN ALSO IN SOME POOR COMMUNITIES TO IMPROVE SERVICE AND TO GET THOSE INDIVIDUALS OUT FASTER BECAUSE THE ATTITUDE WAS ALMOST AS IF. WHAT YOU FOLKS HAVE NOWHERE TO GO ANYWAY BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL POOR SO YOU YOU CAN AFFORD TO SIT AROUND DMB FOR FIVE AND SIX HOURS TO GET AN ID CARD OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE? WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU THOUGH IS THAT? UP HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR US TO GET SOME SEE SOME PROGRESS BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN LOVE MEANT ALL DAY LONG AS WE SIT HERE AND ASK YOU QUESTIONS AND AND YOU'RE AWARE OF IT AND IT'S A HUGE AGENCY. CALLED THAT HAS LOTS OF EMPLOYEES WE HAVE GIVEN YOU MORE RESPOND ABILITIES AS WE GIVEN AT AND NOW YOU'VE GOT OTHER THINGS IN A BIT AT AT THE REGISTRATION FOR INDIVIDUALS TO VOTE IN YOU. SO WE WEWE PUT A LOT OF THINGS ON THE MP I RECOGNIZE THAT AND AND I THINK SOMETIMES WE DO THAT WITHOUT THINKING THAT THAT REALLY TAKES AWAY FROM. THE OTHER TAX WHICH IS USED TO BE JUST GIVING OUT A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND THEN WITH THE ID'S AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO BUDGET VOTER REGISTRATION AND NOW WE DEAL WITH TELL. THOSE WHO ARE NOT CITIZENS GETTING LICENSES SO THAT THE AGENCY AS WELL OKAY. DO YOU HAVE A TIMELINE WHEN WE CAN SAY WHO THIS IS GOING TO BE OKAY. THE DO YOU KNOW WHEN OF FOLKS WILL PROBABLY BE FEELING THAT IT IS REASONABLE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT REASONABLE IS IS REASONABLE AN HOUR DMB. IT I'M IS THAT A REASONABLE TIME FRAME TO PEOPLE TO SAY WHAT I'M GOING TO SPEND OUR GOOD ON THE DMV GET MY LICENSE RENEW TO GET WHATEVER DONE. AND TEND TO MY BUSINESS THAT I HAVE THAT'S NOT COMPLICATED BUSINESS BUT JUST BASIC BUSINESS. YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN WE WILL SEE THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT FOR US TO TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU SAY WHAT WE WANT MORE. COMPUTERS ALL WE WANT MORE THIS WOMAN WHAT WAS THAT THAT'S FINE AND AND AND AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT FOR YOU PROBABLY WILL MORE THAN LIKELY IF THIS STUFF IS FORTY YEARS OLD WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO DO THAT. BUT FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE STREET THEY WON'T BE DANCING IN THE STREET BECAUSE YOU GOT NEW COMPUTERS. THEY WILL BE DANCING IN THE STREETS BECAUSE THEY SPEND OUR INDIAN MOVIE THIS. IS JUST THAT SIMPLE HOWEVER WE DID IT THERE WILL BE DANCE IN THE STREETS FOR THAT REASON. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT THE TIMELINE. ALL DAY LONG BUT WHAT IS THE TIMELINE WHEN WE WHEN DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME GREAT IDEAS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN TEXT ME AND TELL ME I'LL BE. THAT MY NUMBER WILL PROBABLY COME UP IN THIRTY MINUTES IS GREAT BECAUSE THEN I CAN COME BACK TO THE NBA AND DO THAT. BUT WHEN IS THIS STUFF GOING TO BE IN PLACE OF THE WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE SOME REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE POPE'S AWAITING BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT ADVICE TALKING ABOUT. WITH ALL THE OTHER STUFF THE TIME HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET THEIR BUSINESS DONE. WHEN WE SPEAK GET TO SEE THE REDUCTION IN IN IN AND INTO AND WAIT TIME? AND SO THAT WE CAN BEEN TALK ABOUT HOLDING FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHATEVER'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY HOW WE GOING TO SEE THE WAY WHEN WE GOT TO SEE THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA AT ALL SO WITH THE THINGS THAT I HAD A DAY TALKED ABOUT SO WITH THE INTEGRATION OF THE APPLICATION INTO DRIVE LIKE SYSTEM THAT'LL. OCCUR MILTON THAT SEPTEMBER SO WE HOPE TO SEE THAT EFFECT AND SEEN THE REDUCTION IN THE WAIT TIMES WHERE -- OUR OUR TECHNICIANS CHECKING THEM FOR NOT HAVING TO KEEP THAT INFORMATION SO FROM -- MILLICENT WE ARE JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO REDUCE THE TIME BETWEEN NOW AND MIL SEPTEMBER. FAMILAR SEPTEMBER ONTO THE END OF THE YEAR OUT WE WE ARE GOAL IS TO DO JUST THAT WAIT TIME AND SO WE WANT TO GET BACK TO THE LEVELS THAT WE WERE BEFORE WHICH IS -- A FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR AN APPOINTMENT CUSTOMER AND AROUND UP FORTY FIVE MINUTES FOR A NON APPOINTMENT CUSTOMERS THAT ALL THAT IS OUR GOAL SO SO BEGINNING FROM SEPTEMBER OF TO DECEMBER WE SHOULD STOP SLEEVES BEGAN TO SEE THE DECLINE. IN THE WAITING TIME YES THAT THAT IS OUR INTENT SO BETWEEN NOW IN THE MIDDLE SEPTEMBER YOU'RE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTING THESE THINGS THAT WILL HELP US BEGIN TO SEE THE REDUCTION HOME AFTER RENEW MY LICENSE ON THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER SO THAT'S FINE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. AND I GOT THE NOTICE LIKE THE OTHER DAY AND I REALIZE OKAY I GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS MADNESS AND GET AN APPOINTMENT TO DO SOMETHING SO I DON'T WANT TO BE. I DON'T BE THE FACE OF THE M. V. BOB SO YOU'RE SAYING BY THE MIDDLE SEPTEMBER MOVING FORWARD. WE SHOULD BE SEEING A REDUCTION AND WAIT TIME YES BECAUSE WE ARE IN OUR GOAL IS TO GET DOWN TO THE FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THE FORTY FIVE MINUTES BY DECEMBER. THAT THAT IS OUR OUR GOAL AND WE ALL WORK HARD TO GET TO THAT NOT BUT AGAIN. WE HAVE TO BALANCE BETWEEN YOUR CUSTOMERS YOU KNOW IF WE SEE. A MORE CUSTOMERS COMING AND THEN YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE THEY NEED IN ORDER WE HAVE TO REDIRECT RESOURCES THE AND SO A WE ARE WORKING VERY HIGH. AND TO TO ACHIEVE THAT HAVE YOU EMPLOYED OR ARE YOU GOING TO EMPLOY SOME OF YOUR RETIRED EMPLOYEES WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEM. YES WE HAVE MADE THAT CALL OUT AND WE ALREADY HAVE SOME OF RETIRED IN NEWTON AND PLAYS WE TRY AND NOTICED THEM AND SAID THEY WOULD COME BACK AND WORK FOR US. OKAY BECAUSE I MEAN THAT WOULD BE ALSO EQUALLY IMPORTANT IF THEY IF YOU HAVE A CUT SCHOOLS DO THIS ALL THE TIME NOW. UP MAY BE BECAUSE THE KNOWLEDGE IS THE AT THE SKILL IS THE AND YOU NOT ALWAYS EVEN IF YOU TRAINING FOLKS YOU STILL NEED EXPERIENCED PEOPLE TO BE TO STEP IN YOU BET. TO THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT YOU NEED TO TRAIN IN YOU STILL NEED SOME EXPERIENCE PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING WORSE IN BETWEEN IN LIFE EIGHT HOURS AND THEN GET SOMEBODY BRAND NEW LESLIE BEHEST OF TO IDENTIFY AS TOM EVERYTHING THE DO YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAT. WE HAVE ASKS OF PEOPLE EVERY TYPE THEIR INTEREST IN COMING BACK SO WE'VE ALREADY MADE THAT CALL OUT OKAY WE ONLY HAVE HAVE DONE SOME INTEREST OKAY GREAT LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT HAPPENS THANK YOU. THICKNESS SCORE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU YOURSELF AND CHEN FRAZIER FOR HOSTING THIS ARM. AFTER BEING HOME FOR A MONTH. I GOT A VERY CLEAR OF PICTURE FOR MY CONSTITUENTS THAT THIS IS A GOOD TOPIC OF THEM ON TOP OF MY CONCERN. ADDS ONE OF WHICH MY COLLEAGUE LACK WHEN SHE GOT HOME IN LATE DECEMBER MY SUSPICION. BUT A BIG OF A CREW CAMERAS FOLLOWING. HIM HE CAN STRAIGHT BECAUSE I I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE DR WEBER YOU KNOW WE HAVE LONG UNDERSTOOD THAT THE HILLCREST DMV AND MY SIMPLY DISTRICT IS GOING TO HAVE A LONG LINE. YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE VERY LONG TIME YOU GONNA STAND IN THE SUN IT'S NOT GONNA BE A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE AND SO I HAVE TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE START RAISING THIS ISSUE WITH ME. I THOUGHT IT WAS MORE OF THE SAME BUT OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING IS EXTREMELY DIFFERENT AND THERE ARE REAL EQUITY ISSUES THAT ARE IN THERE THAT EVEN WHEN -- THAT WAIT TIMES COME DOWN I HOPE WE DO TALK ABOUT OF THESE COMMUNITIES TO HAVE LONG EXPERIENCE THIS I DID NOT GET MY DRIVER'S LICENSE IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU WENT RIGHT YOU WENT SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE SO SHE BRINGS UP SOMETHING THAT IS. ALMOST UNRELATED TO TODAY'S CONVERSATION BUT VERY MUCH RELATED AND I AND I HOPE YOU TOOK THAT TO HEART -- AND DIRECTOR OF I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW I LIKE TO TELL MY CONSTITUENTS WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ARE ARMED AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOR THE STATE AND SO I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY. ON BECAUSE I NEED TO VOCALIZE ON THEIR BEHALF WHAT THEY HAVE SHARED -- THESE ARE MILD MANNERED PEOPLE ARE WHO I COME ACROSS IN MY DAY WHO ARE NOT HAPPY CAMPERS -- AND THEY VERY MUCH EXPECT EXPECT ME TO EXPRESS THAT TO TODAY I THINK MY COLLEAGUES OF COVERED THAT WELL. ON BUT THEN HE BECOMES AFTER THAT EXPRESSION IS THEY AREN'T AYE FOR THINGS LIKE MISSOURI HELL ON EARTH I'M ALL THE KINDS OF DESCRIPTIONS WHICH AGAIN I THINK ARE OFTEN TRITE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE DMV IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW PEOPLE COMMONLY TO SAY THAT ABOUT THE M. BEAT ME NEVER. GET CREDIT FOR COMING IN AND OUT UNLESS A FEW MINUTES I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFERENT AND I THINK THIS HEARING ILLUSTRATES THAT POINT TO YOU -- BUT I THINK THE CONSTITUENTS THAT IT ATTEMPT TO MEET IT STUCK IN MY MIND THE MOST IS A HE SAT WILL WEAKEN APPOINTMENT FOR OVER FIVE HOURS IN THE HILLCREST DMV ON IT IS OBSERVATION HAS A LONG HISTORY IN BUSINESS IN THE BIT PRIVATE SECTOR. IF THIS WAS A BUSINESS IT WOULD BE OUT OF BUSINESS WE HAVE SERVICE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS -- SO I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT REAL IDEAS A DRIVER BEHIND THIS. AND I HEARD SOME DESCRIPTIONS ABOUT WHY PROPS THE PLANNING DID MIND OF EXACTLY WITH EXPERIENCE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME. ON IS THERE ANY STATE IS DOING THIS CORRECTLY MEAN EVERYONE IS UNDER THIS OBLIGATION HEAVY TALK TO YOUR COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES. BY THE EXPERIENCE IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE HERE ARE THERE OTHERS THAT ARE GETTING IT RIGHT AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING SHOULD WE DO THAT HERE I GO THERE ARE SOME STATES ARE EXPERIENCE SOME OF THIS -- SAME -- NEW MEXICO IS ONE THAT IMPLEMENTED AND NEW YORK IT'S IMPLEMENTED AND SOME OF THE STATES AND WE HAVE OUT TALK TO THOSE STATES IN AND ASKED FOR THEIR IN SHARING THEIR THE BEST PRACTICES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING SO WE DO. I HAVE THAT BUT DATA AND THE STATE OF THE STATES ARE NOT AS BIG AS CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE LARGEST POPULATION AND SO WE HAVE THE MOST CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF SERVING. UP OUR CITIZENS A LOT OF STATES HAVE A LOT SMALLER POPULATION AND IT WOULD NOT GET THAT THEY DON'T HAVE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD. ARM AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY WEREN'T HAVING IF THERE WERE NO OTHER STATE TO THIS PROBLEM YOU'D UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE OF A BAD DAY FOR YOU GOT A LOT WORSE RIGHT. NOW BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT OTHER STATES ARE EXPERIENCING THIS IS WHAT SOME OF THE STATES ARE SOME STATES HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED YET. AND IN SO AND YOU KNOW WE DEFTLY HAVE CONTACT OTHER STATES IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICES THAT THEY'RE USING IF WE CAN. COPY THOSE OUT WE WILL AND ADDITIONAL. WORK MAY I SEE THE MONEY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN EXPENDED UNDER THE BUDGET THE ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION MORE POSITIONS THAT YOU MENTION TODAY THAT COULD BE HELPFUL IN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. THAT'S REAL MONEY. A WE GET ANYTHING FROM THE FEDS TO THOSE AND KNOW WHERE NOT DIED THEY HAD SOME GRANTS AVAILABLE YEARS BACK WE DID I'D. MAKE YOURSELF AVAILABLE OF THOSE GRANTS AND WE HAD DONE SOME THINGS TO IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES IN ANTICIPATION OF GETTING READY FOR ID AND THAT WAS PRIOR TO THAT -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE THE REGULATIONS IN PLACE IN SO STATES HAD APPLIED FOR A WEEK AND I CAN'T GO BACK AND GET FOR YOU HOW MUCH WAY THAT GRANT MONEY WE DID RECEIVE. BUT GUESS IT'S NOT THE NEARLY HUNDRED MILLION OR SO THAT I THINK NOW IS IN THIS MEMO IN FRONT OF ME NO -- OKAY -- WITH REGARD TO THE POSITIONS THAT ARE BEING FILLED -- YOU'VE GOTTEN YOU GOT AUTHORIZATION WITH THIS BUDGET FOR FIVE FIFTEEN ANY VERY HARD FOUR HUNDRED IS THAT MY UNDERSTANDING THIS MEMO QUICKLY. ALMOST ALL OF OUR POSITIONS WE HAVE HIRED THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY I THINK AND THEN THAT OF THE FIVE FIFTY WERE REALLY I'M I'M HAVE A SMALL WRAPPED UP. OR DOWN TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE OF THOSE ARE OUR I'M HAVE HIGHER HAVE NOT STARTED DATES IN THE OTHER FIFTEEN WILL HAVE START DATES BY THE END OF THIS MONTH. HIM FOR THE THOSE POSITIONS IN THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED BY THOSE PERMANENT HIRES [inaudible] NO. IT'S ABOUT WHAT'S THEIR TERM YOU KNOW GO AHEAD. SO THAT I'M THE ONE THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET ASK THOSE A BIT OF A MULTI YEAR TERM AND THE ONES FOR THE TWO THIRTY WE WOULD PROBABLY LOOK SINCE WE KNOW THAT IN THE OUT YEARS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STILL RAMP UP YOU KNOW AS WE CLOSE. TO TWENTY TWENTY ORIGINAL BOMB PROJECTION WAS THAT THERE'S ANY MORE PEOPLE COMING IN TO GET THE REAL ID BECAUSE YOU ARE YOU HITTING THAT DEADLINE AND SO OUR REGION LAST HAD A HIGHER RAMP UP. SO THE TWO THIRTY WE WOULD PROBABLY KEEP. EACH YEAR AND THAT WE BE ASKING FOR MORE BUT ALL THE POSITIONS ARE ON WHAT THEY'RE CALLED THAT I'M PERMANENT OR MITTENS. AND SO. DIRECTORS AND WIND UP HAVING TO TO GO DOWN ONCE THE WORKLOAD. THESIS RIGHT NOW AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE. GOING TO TREAT THEM IT IS THAT RIGHT IN MY IT WAS DOES THIS BOOKLET FALL OFF. TWENTY TWENTY OR DOES THIS CONTINUE I MEAN THE REAL IDEA LAWSUIT CORRECT SO -- ONCE YOU COME IN AND GET THE REAL ID AND YOU GO BACK TO THE NORMAL CYCLE OVERDOING BY MAIL GOING ONLINE AND SUCH THAT THE INITIAL EMPLOY I'M. MINOR GRAYSON YES THEY HAVE THERE IS A BILL RAMP UP. IN TERMS OF HOW MANY PHYSICIANS STATE PERMITTED IS UNCLEAR IN PART BECAUSE YOU. PROJECTIONS BEING ABOUT THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO MENTION IS I LOOK AT YOU IN THE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROJECTIONS MAY BE. EMPLOYEES ARE RETIRING SO ON SO FORTH SO THE REMAINS WE SEE HOW MANY OF THE FIVE FIFTY GET GET KEPT OVER TIME THAT IS CORRECT OBVIOUSLY AS WE HIRE EMPLOYEES THERE IS A HIGH ATTRITION RATE WITH A DEPARTMENT THAT HAS. NO RATE THOUSAND PLAY IN TOTAL OVER. FOR THERE'S A CONSTANT TURNOVER ANYWAYS QUICKLY THAT YOU HIRE SOMEONE AS A TEMPORARY POSITION OR PERMANENT ADMIN AS WHAT THEY WOULD CALL. AND IF YOU HAD A FULL TIME POSITION OPENED UP OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO BRING THAT YES YOU'RE RIGHT ON IT. BY IRAQ I GUESS THAT'S ONE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE RECOUP THE PROBLEM WHICH CHALLENGE AT THIS IS YOU HAVE A CRISIS ON YOUR HANDS YOU'RE TRYING TO HIGHER UP BUT SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT BE. ATTRACTIVE POSITIONS IF THEY'RE NOT LONGER TERM FOR AND SUCH TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH AN AYE WE SETTING UP FOR SUCCESS FAILURE WHERE THE CHALLENGES YOU DOING. I'M I KNOW THE HOURS LATENESS CHEN I WANT TO BE RELATIVELY QUICK THE LAST THING I WOULD JUST SAY THIS WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MEMO BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AVERAGE TIMES ARE ABOUT PUTTING THIS IN PRINT RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK. ANYONE DOES ANYONE ANY FAVORS I MEAN I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED A TWENTY THREE MINUTE EXPERIENCE THE DMV I JUST NEVER HEARD THAT. THAT MAYBE AGAIN A PART OF DOCTOR WEAPONIZE EXPERIENCE. BUT I I JUST IT IT SEEMS LIKE INSULT TO INJURY TO CONSTITUENTS ARE CALLING MY OFFICE AND REQUESTING ASSISTANCE A WITNESS SO I MEAN. IT IT IT IT SOUNDS OUT OF IT TONE DEAF TO PUT THAT IN WRITING THAT MAY BE THE STATEWIDE METRIC BUT I JUST. I WOULD SAY UNTIL YOU GET BACK TO YOUR THE OBJECTIVE AT THE END OF THE YEAR REPEATING THAT IS THE THAT'S IS NOT DOING ANYONE ANY GOOD -- THE LAST THING I GUESS I WOULD ASK HURT MALIK COLLEAGUES ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED YOU'VE BEEN VERY EXPLICIT AND THANK YOU AYE I SERVED ON THE LOCAL CITY COUNCIL WERE STAFF WASN'T OFTEN POWERED SAY WHICH NEEDED. TO HEARING FROM YOU WHAT YOU NEED NOW IT'S ON US TO KIND DELIVER RIGHT TO GET THAT -- THAT SAID WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE TO DATE TO CONSTITUENT I SPEAKING WITH A CONSTITUENT JUST THIS MORNING SHE HAS APPOINTMENT TOMORROW AYE SHE THOUGHT I'D APPOINTMENT I'M GOOD TO GO. HIGH WAS WARNING HER NO YOU'RE GONNA WANNA PIE CANCEL YOUR AFTERNOON -- HERE. AND WHAT BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE TERRIBLE AND FOR THE STATE SO WHAT ADVICE DO I GIVE BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF TOWN HALL MEETING I THINK IN A WEEK WHAT WHAT OUT IF YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT I WOULD NOT CANCEL THAT APPOINTMENT I WOULD SHOW UP FOR THE APPOINTMENT. LOW NO FOR THE REST OF HER AFTERNOON HE'S GOT A POINT YEAH BUT SHE CUT IN OUT. OUR TO MAYBE WHATEVER BUT I'M TELLING HER. AND I THINK WHAT LIKELY WHEN SHE COULD NO THEY'RE NOT ALONE WHILE THE TRIAGE AND IN THE OFFICE WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AND NON APPOINTMENT LYING IN SO WE HAVE START YOUR WINDOWS TECHNICIANS. AND SHE WILL BE AIRED A DIRECTED TO THE APPOINTMENT LYING WHEN SHE WOULD BE SERVED UP AS SOON AS WE CAN GET UP THERE SO IT BE HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE IN FAVOR HAD APPOINTMENT WE SCHEDULED STAGGER THOSE APPOINTMENTS SO. THAT SHE WOULD GO TO THE APPOINTMENT LINE. TO GET IN OF ITSELF IN TERMS OF ADVICE FOR SHE HAS ALL THE RIGHT DOCUMENT NOON BETWEEN A WHAT HER TRANSACTION IS WITH THE DMV. OF IF HE'S GOING TO GET A ROLE LIKE THE SHE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT DOCUMENTS AND THEN WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE. LOOK FOR TREE AT THE LOOK FOR THE TRIAGE LINE AT THE PERSON SHOULD BE CHALLENGING THE LINE DIRECT INERTIA THE RIGHT LINE SHE SHE THESE -- BE DIRECTED TO WHICH IS THE APPOINTMENT LINE TO GET AND THEN SHE WOULD GET ISSUED A TICKET AT THE START HERE WINDOW. IN THIS TRIAGE THAT SITUATION THAT EVERY LOCATION IT'S OUT OF YOUR TV. SET EVERY LOCATION ANY OTHER HELPFUL TIPS FOR FOLKS I THINK THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES THAT THAT THE DIRECTORS ALSO MENTIONED IS A VERY GOING TO GET A REAL ID ACT ON OUR WEBSITE WE HAVE A CHECKLIST. THAT ACTED INTERACTIVE CHECKLIST AS EARLY AS YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS TO SAY OKAY HAVE THIS DOCUMENT FOR A REAL ID THE HAVE THE STOCK IN THE STOCK AND THEN ACTUALLY HAS A PRINT OUT OF THE AND I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL. WE HAVE ANYTHING. THEY COME IN IN THAT THEY'RE MISSING AND DOCUMENTS SO THAT THE MATTER OF YOU KNOW THE NAY THAT THE GO BACK HOME AT THE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER APPOINTMENT. SO THEN THEY'VE LOST THAT TIME I'M AND THAT'S ONE OF THE OBVIOUSLY IT'S A HUGE FRUSTRATION I'M FROM A CONCERT REBEKAH BUT THAT'S THAT WHEN SOMETHING THAT THE DIRECTOR DOESN'T WANT EITHER. AND SO ONE OF BIG THINGS ON THE TRIAGE IS THE TRY CATS AT THE FRONT RIGHT IF WE CAN HAVE THAT PROCESS OF THEY'RE NOT WAITING IN THAT THAT. THAT PREACH YOU LINE FOR THE OUR WHATEVER THEY SAY DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT NOT BECAUSE IF NOT THEN HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DEAL. BY THINK THE BIGGEST THING IS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE CONTINUE TO REITERATE. IS THAT EDUCATION OF IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET REALLY DO WHAT OF THE DOCUMENTATION THAT YOU NEED I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS. ON THAT THAT WE TRIED TO ADVOCATE OUT OKAY JUST TRY TO GET SOME HELPFUL TIPS REPORT RESISTING RIGHT. UP BE PART OF SOLUTION ALSO I'VE HEARD WHAT YOU NEED AVERAGE ADVICE ON WHAT NEEDS TO BEAT WHAT SOMEONE CAN DO TO HELP THEMSELVES I'VE HEARD THE OBJECTIVE STANDARDTHAT YOU WANNA BE JUDGED AGAINST. SOME IMPROVEMENT STARTING MID SEPTEMBER BACK TO NORMAL HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND WE AS A LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY ARE CAPABLE AND WILL HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE TO HEAT IT THOSE MARKS -- THE LAST OBSERVATION THAT MAKE ONE IS THAT I WANTED I THINK AUDITS ARE GOOD THING AND I THINK IT'S GOOD ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE TO HAVE THAT HIDING HERE YOU SAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT. I DO WANT KNOWLEDGE NOTHING IS FREE NOTHING THAT YOU DON'T GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING -- AND IT JUST WOULD BE COGNIZANT OF THAT I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TIME BEING HERE TODAY TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN PUBLIC AND THAT'S AN EXPENDITURE OF YOUR RESOURCE I MATCHING THAT'S PREVENTING YOU FROM ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE OF THESE PARTS I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN CLONED AND SO I'M AYE KNOWLEDGE THAT NOTHING IS FREE. RIGHT INTO REPRESENT OTHERWISE IS NOT ACCURATE NUMBER THAT SAID NOT IT AT SOME POINT PROBABLY OUGHT TO BE DONE LET'S CHAPTER THAT FOR AFTER THE END OF THE YEAR LET'S FIX THIS BURST. AND THEN COME BACK AND FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU SHOULD DO I GO. FOR RELATED BECAUSE THAT TO LONG LINES AT SHIRLEY KNIGHT TO DEAL WITH FOR A LONG TIME. WHY THERE IS NO FREE WIFI IN THE NB AS I HAVE NO IDEA PLEASE DO THAT I AM SURE YOU CAN GET A CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP TO HELP SOMEBODY? IT DOESN'T MAKE A FIVE OR EIGHT HOUR WAIT ANY BETTER BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT YOU'RE NOT BELONG TO YOUR DAY AT IT HAVE INSULT TO INJURY. I DON'T KNOW IF SOME OF THEM HAVE THEM BUT I DON'T MIND DOESN'T I'M AND I THINK THAT THAT CAN GO A LONG WAY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SOMEHOW TECH SAVVY SOMEWHAT WITH IT SOMEWHAT IN THE REALM OF THE REAL LIFE PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING. ON LIFE SHOT BUT MY DMV'S ON SATURDAY MORNING TELEVISION I'M GETTING READY TO GO TO TOWN HALL MEETING I'M WATCHING MY CONSTITUENTS LINED UP THERE ALL ON THEIR PHONES YEAH -- AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME TO BE LIKE ONE WAY TO SHOW SOME SORT OF FATE THAT WE GET IT AND THAT SHOULD BE THERE REGARDLESS OF THERE'S AN EIGHT HOUR WAIT AND ONE HOUR WAIT OR TWENTY THREE MINUTE WAIT. JUST A FREE OPPOSITE YET SO WE DON'T WE I DO OFFER THERE IS FREE WIFI IN SOME OFFICE SOME OF THEM IT'S BEEN MORE DIFFICULT TO GET THAT CAN ACTIVITY SIDE VENDOR THAT HAS THE MESSAGE MORE IT. DOES GET THAT FREE WIFI AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE THEY'RE HAVING SOME CHALLENGES IN GETTING THE WIFI BUT WILL GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT THIS IS THE TIME FOR THAT VENDOR BECOME A HERO YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK THAT BEING A THANK YOU THIS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU I WANNA THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND TAKING THE TIME. TO UPDATE US ON WHAT'S HAPPENING I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS AND ON SOME OF THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE REPETITIVE BUT I JUST WANT TO REALLY DROVE HOME WHAT HAVE I WHAT STOOD OUT TO ME IN THIS FIRST OF ALL YOU CERTAINLY HAVE SOME GOOD IDEAS IN TERMS OF THE TRIAGE BANG IN. THE TEXTING -- YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS REALLY CONCERNING ON WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING AT THE MPS I REPRESENT GLENDALE AND I'VE SEEN THE LINES GROW. AND GO DOWN THE BLOCK A FEW WEEKS AGO THE TEMPERATURES IN MY CITY HAD A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN DEGREES. SO I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU THE FIRST IS DURING THAT HUNDRED DEGREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN DEGREE. DAY AND THEN THE HUNDRED AND TEN DAY OUR DEGREE DAY AFTER AND ALL OF THE HOT DAYS WE'VE BEEN HAVING. HAS ANYBODY IN YOUR OFFICE GIVEN YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE HAVE THEIR THEIR JOBS THAT THEY DO BUT IS ANYBODY EVER JUST SAID HEY WERE THE D. M. V. WE HAVE. A BIG BUDGET. I'M GONNA GO TO COSTCO AND SPEND FORTY DOLLARS -- A PER UMBRELLA TO BUY TWENTY UMBRELLAS TO PUT DOWN THE STREET OR WHATEVER IT IS. I MEAN HAS ANYONE. EVER BROUGHT YOU A SUGGESTION JUST LIKE THAT IN OUR THE EMPLOYEES EMPOWERED TO EVEN THINK ABOUT THOSE SORTS OF OF SOLUTIONS WHEN PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY IN PHYSICAL DANGER BY GOING TO YOUR ESTABLISHMENT. AND IF NOT. I THINK THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT EMPOWERING PEOPLE AND REALLY HAVING THEM THINK ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU KNOW FACT THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE EVEN ALLOWED. TO BE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT. TO DO UNNECESSARY. SOMETHING THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE TO WORK. TO ME IS IS REALLY OUTRAGEOUS SO HAS ANY HAVE ANY OF YOUR EMPLOYEES CALL TWO ADJUSTMENT THAT'S JUST AS ANYBODY DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SET YET YET SO AND TERMS OF YES WE ASK IF WE COULD DEVELOP GET CANOPIES OUTSIDE THE OFFICE BECAUSE IT DOWN IN SOUTHERN CAL NO I DIDN'T ASK IF YOU CAN DO THAT NO I SAID WHEN I WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN DEGREES OUT. WHO DID YOUR EMPLOYEE JUST GO AND DO THAT ON THEIR OWN OR DO THEY JUST THANK HATE IT'S NOT MY JOB TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE PEOPLE? THAT'S GONNA TAKE EIGHT MONTHS YOU KNOW SOMEONE THINKING ABOUT THIS AND SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE OR DID THEY JUST THINK. THAT PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE IT'S UNDER THE CHIN WRISTS NOT MY PROBLEM. NO I DON'T BELIEVE OUR PLACE THINK THAT IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM I KNOW THEY ARE THEY THEY YOU KNOW ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE CUSTOMERS AND I KNOW WE CAN GET A PHONE CALL CAN WE GO OUT AND GET. SOME UMBRELLAS OR THAT WE WILL LOOK. BE A SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO GO AHEAD AND GETS THE ROLE IS AND TAKE PEOPLE OUT FROM THE HEAT OR IF THERE'S INCOME THAT WAY. BUT I MEAN I'M NOT JUST THINKING ABOUT THAT ONE INSTANCE BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THE MINDSET THAT WHEN THERE'S A CLEAR PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS TO ANYBODY. BUT YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO TIM EITHER MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN OR THAT SOMEONE IS EMPOWERED IN THAT OFFICE. TO BE ABLE. TO GO TO JUST THINK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT I THINK THAT ANY BUSINESS PERSON WOULD THINK OF OR YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO WAS COMPASSIONATE WOULD JUST MAKE THAT CHOICE AND I THINK THAT UNTIL YOU HAVE A A A WORKFORCE. THAT HAS THAT IN THEIR MIND IN THAT WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF THEY DON'T DO THAT. YOU'RE GONNA END UP IN THE SAME SITUATION OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND YOU KNOW AND I HAVE YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF WHY EVERYONE KEEPS GOING BACK TO THIS LETTER. AND HARPING ON THE WAIT TIME. WE PUT THIS ONLINE TODAY AND TALK AND MENTIONED THAT I WAS GOING TO BE AT THIS HEARING AND INVITED PEOPLE TO WATCH IT. AND ALTHOUGH WE'VE HAD IS A HUGE. STRING OF COMMENTS ABOUT. THAT WAY TIME PEOPLE PICKED UP ON THAT IMMEDIATELY. AND THAT MEANS THAT THE THAT YOU HAVE BY DOING THIS PERPETUATED. OF THE FEELING THAT PEOPLE CAN'T TRUST YOUR AGENCY WHEN MISTER PATTERSON HAS TO ASK YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT WHETHER. COMPUTER OUTAGES AND GLITCHES ARE COMMON AND YOU REFUSE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION IT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL VERY TRUSING THAT ANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE MAKE AND THAT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE HERE WITH ALL THE BEST INTENTIONS. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST. AND THIS IS NOT AN HONEST TIME AND I I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE GOAL OF PUTTING BENEFITS WAS TO MAKE US FEEL BETTER. ON IT CERTAINLY MAKES PEOPLE MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT. THE ATTEMPTS YOU KNOW IN THE COMMUNICATION AND THE TRANSPARENCY SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY OF US BROUGHT UP I CAN TELL YOU MY CONSTITUENTS SAW THAT IMMEDIATELY. I'VE BEEN REALLY SURPRISED AT THE AMOUNT OF ANGER PEOPLE HAVE HAD. IN MY COMMUNITY WHEN THEY SAW THAT WHEN I POSTED THAT LETTER I ALSO WANT TO PIGGYBACK ON SOMETHING THAT MS BAKER HAD SAID THAT I HAD WRITTEN DOWN AS WELL WHICH WAS ABOUT YOUR COMMENT SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT WORKING WITH YOUR PARTNERS WITH YOUR PARTNERS LIKE TRIPLE A AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT REDUCES. THE DEMAND ON THE FACILITIES WHEN YOU WORK WITH YOUR PARTNERS BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT SETTING UP A SORT OF A DUAL TRACK OF THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS WITH THE HAVES. BEING ENCOURAGE HEY. YOU GOT THE MONEY. EVEN IF IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A TRIPLE A PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY THAT IF THEY CAN DO IT TO NOT HAVE GOOD YOUR FACILITY. I'D LIKE TO KNOW AT SOME POINT WITH THE AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES YOU'RE PUTTING INTO THOSE PARTNER PROGRAMS TO KIND OF GIVE A FAST TRACK BECAUSE THAT'S A FAST TRACK FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. I AND MY CONCERN IS THAT YOU'RE PUTTING RESOURCES THERE INSTEAD OF IN YOUR FACILITIES SIPHONING OFF PEOPLE. FOR A GREAT EXPERIENCE WHO CAN PAY AND USING TAXPAYER MONEY BUT THEN PENALIZE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING THAT. WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT EXTRA AND END UP GOING TO THE DMV AYE I'M CONCERNED IT'S ONE THING IF IT DOESN'T COST A LOT YOU HAVE TO DO IT ANYWAY? BUT IF YOU'RE PUTTING RESOURCES THERE FOR AND AND YOU KNOW HOPING THAT APPEAL PEOPLE OFF YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE PEELING OFF. ARE THE ONES WHO CAN AFFORD IT I I AM CONCERNED ABOUT PUTTING RESOURCES INTO A FAST TRACK. YOU KNOW FOR WEALTHIER PEOPLE AND LEAVING EVERYONE ELSE KIND OF TO GET THE LAST OF THE RESOURCES TO IMPROVE THEIR EXPERIENCE SO WE IT DAVEY DOES NOT WE DON'T NOT. PUT RESOURCES IN THE AUTO CLUB CELLS ARE -- AND PLACE OF THE OUT OF CLIPS OVER NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YOU WOULD SAID EARLIER YOU HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WORKING ON YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM WITH YOUR PARTNER AGENCIES WITH THEIR PART WITH THOSE PARTNERS FIRST. MAY I MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU SAID WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU ARE WORKING WITH THEM. TO TO KIND OF BRING THAT UP IDEA I MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD SO I JUST WANT. TO BE CLEAR THEN SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ANY EXTRA RESOURCES INTO THAT THEY JUST. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE TAPPING INTO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T THERE'S NO COST TO DMB FOR ANY OF THAT. NO WE DON'T DOES WE DON'T TO PAY IT'S JUST A PARTNERHIP WHERE THEY ARE OF ALLOW WE ALLOW THEM TO PROCESS OUR TRANSACTIONS VEHICLE REGISTRATION TRANSACTIONS AND THEY ARE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE AUTO CLUB. THEY HAVE ACCESS TO PROCESSES SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE DMV I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE THEIR EMPLOYEES SO THAT FOR FOR THEM TO ACCESS YOUR SYSTEM THERE'S NO FINANCIAL COST TO DMB FOR THAT. NO IT'S JUST A WE MAINTAIN OUR SYSTEM NO THERE'S NO -- COST DATA WE ARE THEY JUST HAVE ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEM OKAY THAT'S GREAT SO I GUESS I MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD SOMETHING YOU SAID EARLIER. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR COMPUTERS IN THE TIME TABLE AND YOU YOU HAD MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT THE INVESTMENT SO WE ARE MORE IN TERMS OF MODERNIZING OUR SYSTEM SO WE HAVE OF? GOD TREND VEHICLE TRIPS OF TRANSIT TRANSACTIONS IN THERE IS A A LOT THAT A FIELD OFFICE DOES OUR PARTNERS SHOWS SUCH AS THERE'S AND ALL BECAUSE CAN ONLY DO A SUB SAID AT THAT. SO WE HAVE TO MODERNIZE ALL ACTION IS SO WE'RE STARTING WITH THE PLANS THAT -- THESE PARTNERS DO AND THEN EXPAND THE ALSO THESE THAT WAS WHAT YOU SAID SO YOU'RE MODERNIZING THOSE SYSTEMS FIRST THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON BUT THAT'S STILL BENEFITS THIS DMV YES SERVICES SO IT WOULD LESSEN THE IMPACT OF THE MODERNIZATION OF THE FIELD US WE START WITH THE FIELD OFFICE. FIRST WE HAVE TO MODERNIZE AND ALL THE TRANSACTIONS THAT ONE TIME WHERE MODERNIZING THE TRANSACTION IN DIFFERENT SUBSETS AND THEN GOING AND ADDING THAT THAT A MORE DIFFICULT TRANSACTIONS THAT TAKE A BIT LONGER SO THAT WE CAN GET THESE DONE THE SUPPLY TRANSACTION STUNT FAST AUDIT. THAT ABSOLUTELY CLARIFIES THAN WHAT YOU SAID SO I I MISUNDERSTOOD THAT SO THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE -- AND THEN LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- I IN AND AND THIS IS PROBABLY BEEN DONE AND I APOLOGIZE IF I'M THAT I DIDN'T. I IF IT HAS BUT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE BASICALLY AN UNFUNDED FEDERAL MANDATE -- AND THAT WE ARE PUTTING QUITE A LOT OF RESOURCES INTO FOR FILLING HAVE WE ASK OUR FEDERAL CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. TO HELP WITH FEDERAL RESOURCES FOR THIS UNFUNDED MANDATE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT THE DIRECTOR I THINK ANSWER THAT QUESTION I BELIEVE EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS JUST MANDATE WAS. SENATE AND BELIEVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE THERE WERE GRANTS THAT WERE AVAIL ARE AVAILABLE TO DIFFERENT STATES TO DO THAT AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE FUNDING THAT WAS OFFERED. BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT FUNDING IS NOT COMPENSATING US FOR THE THE FULL COST OF WHAT THIS IS. SO I'M SUGGESTING THAT WE TRY TO CALCULATE WHAT THAT IS FOR THE REAL ID AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S OTHER ISSUES HERE BUT AT LEAST FOR THE REAL ID PART AND THAT WE DO. AS THIS COMMITTEE ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS ASK OUR ENTIRE FEDERAL DELEGATION. TO HELP US FULFILL THAT UNFUNDED MANDATE FINANCIALLY SO IT DOESN'T OFF. THIS HUGE AMOUNT DOESN'T FALL JUST ON CALIFORNIA. LET'S HOPE THANK YOU RAPPER FOLLOW YOUR LEAD ON THAT THIS BAKER. I THINK A AND I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE LINE A QUESTION ABOUT PARTNERS THAT YOU EITHER WORK AND AND I SHOULD ASK THIS EARLIER IN IT IS WELL CAN YOU DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL WHAT. OUTSIDE NON D. M. V. ENTITIES ARE ABLE TO DO I THINK YOU MENTIONED VEHICLE LICENSE RENEWAL -- WHO WHO ARE THERE'S PARTNERS AND WHAT ELSE CURRENTLY ARE THEY ABLE TO DO? SO WE HAVE -- THOUGHT CLOTHES ARE PARTNERS AND THEY CAN DO AND VEHICLE REGISTRATION YOU WANT SOME TRANSFERS THERE'S A SUBSET OF I CAN GET THOSE SPECIFIC IS A TRANSFER LIKE IF I HAVE A VEHICLE IN TEXAS AND I MOVED HERE THEY CAN HANDLE THAT. OKAY. FLAT ON THE PARTY TRANSFERRED BY THAT POINT YET. CAN'T. HOW WE HAVE REGISTRATION SERVICES THAT DO TRANSACTIONS -- IN THAT WHICH YOU PAY A FEE FOR THAT I WE HAVE -- OUR SELF SERVICE TERMINALS WHERE WE HAVE A VENDOR THAT DOES THAT WHERE THEY PUT THESE TERMINALS THAT WE CAN DO A VEHICLE REGISTRATION RENEWAL ALL CAME OUR PLANT OPERATION IF THE PLAN NOT TO OPERATE YOUR CAR. OKAY. FROM WHAT I AM BEEN SEEKING A BIT MORE ABOUT THE SCENARIO THAT I MENTION WHICH WAS YOU KNOW IT USED TO BE YOU COULD ONLY GO TO THE POST OFFICE. TO MAIL SOMETHING AND I'M JOB SOMETIME THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO THINK OF SOVIET STYLE [inaudible] SERVICE. AT AT A GOVERNMENT SERVICE AND SOME TO GOING TO THE POST OFFICE IN THOSE DAYS THAT WAS IT THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO. YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE ELSE AND NOW YOU CAN GO TO MANY. ENTITIES MAY BECOME PRIVATE FAMILY BUSINESSES FOR THE MOST PART TO GET A LOT OF THE WORK THAT YOU COULD HAVE GONE TO THE POST OFFICE FOR DONE. THERE THAT WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE THE DMV'S GOT TOO IMPORTANT A JOB YOU KNOW IT'S IT IT'S AN IDEA THAT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT FOR EVERYTHING ELSE TO DEVELOP A PACKAGE THAT WE SEND SECURELY IS A PRETTY IMPORTANT JOB. WHAT IS YOUR PURSE NEW YOUR THOUGHT YOUR EXPERTISE ON WHAT MORE WE COULD PUT INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR? THERE WOULD CLEARLY HELP WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE LONG BEFORE THAT REAL ID ISSUE AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS IS THE ONLY PROBLEM YOU'RE EXPERIENCING [inaudible] THERE. THERE BEEN PROBLEMS WITH THE DMV. WHAT WOULD YOU THINK ARE SOME? POSSIBILITIES FOR WHAT MORE WE CAN. ALLOW A PRIVATE ENTITY TO DO TO COMPLEMENT YOUR WORK. AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS. SO AND STATEMENT BEFORE WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME THINGS THAT -- WE WOULD LIKE TO DO WE FILL STAFF TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THOSE I DON'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE THOSE PROPOSAL IF YOU HAVE TO DO THAT THE FORMAL REQUEST FOR POLO PROCESS. AND BECAUSE THEN SOME VENDORS MIKE GIPSON INSIDE TIPS IN TERMS OF OUR LOOKING AT BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME THINGS TO AND NOT DO IT IN THE DMV AND AND DO IT WITH A PARTNER SO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE. SOME THINGS WERE LOOKING AT A JUST NOT ABLE TO DISCUSS THOSE UP PUBLICLY. TIED AND AND I I HOPE THAT THAT WILL LOOK AS MUCH TO THE MODEL WILL HAVE TO STUDY IT MORE OF OF IN TERMS OF THE POST OFFICE AND SEE HOW MUCH MORE YOU ALMOST NEVER HAVE TO WALK IN THERE YOU CAN ALMOST PRINT SOME OF THE THINGS. A LADY A DIFFERENT ERA ALLOW THAT YOU KNOW WE YOU CAN PRINT ALLOW THE FORMS ONLINE RIGHT OFFER ONLINE TRANSACTIONS WE'D WE ARE WORKING TO OFFER MORE ONLINE TRANSACTIONS ONLINE. AND WITH THAT WE CAN PUT MORE ON THOSE SELF SERVICE TERMINALS THEY'RE LOOKING AT SOME THINGS THAT WERE WEAKENED DEFTLY -- YOU KNOW DO SOME DO AND THERE TO TAKE THAT WORK OUTSIDE OF THE DVD WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COME TO THE DMV AND CARE WHICH I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THANK YOU AND WHAT YOUR TIME FRAME FOR HAVING. FOR US TO START TO SEE THE POSSIBILITY AT LEAST KNOWING HERE'S WHAT ELSE SHE HERE'S WHERE ELSE YOU CAN GO TO GET SOME DMV SERVICES OR WHEN THIS RFP IS YOUR WENT WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME WE COULD START TO SEE THAT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT RIGHT NOW I CAN'T. GIVE YOU EXACT TIMEFRAME WE NEED SOMETIME TO BE ABLE TO FLESH THOSE OUT MEDICINES WERE AYE ABLE. TO AT W. WILL LET YOU KNOW THAT CAN AYE WE STILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME TIME TO BUILD THE FLESH THOSE OUT. AND WHAT THAT COST WOULD BE CALLING THEM WORKING ON THAT. I KNOW WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT -- FOR PROBABLY THERE SOME IDEAS THAT WE WERE THINKING ABOUT SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IT FROM FOUNDED LAST SIXTY DAYS IN TERMS OF BRAINSTORMING. WHAT ELSE WHAT CAN WE TAKE OUT OF THE DEAN V. AND INFLUENCE AND A PARTNERSHIP THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THAT? THINKING I WAS GONNA FOLLOW UP SO. DO YOU THINK BY. THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR WILL SEE SOMETHING YOU THINK IN THE NEXT THIRTY DAYS MEAN FOR ANY OUTSIDE PROPOSALS OUT GET GET WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW I I'D I DID SQUEEZE IN. A VISIT WITH A CALL WITH THE VENDOR -- THIS AFTERNOON THIS MORNING TO FURTHER FLESH OUT SOME OF THESE THINGS SO WE ARE. ACTIVELY TALKING AND TWO OTHER A ENTITIES IN TERMS OF WHAT WE COULD DO. TELL ENTITLED TO KNOW YOU GOT MY TO MY QUESTION IS. HOPEFULLY WITHIN THE NURSES NEXT THIRTY SIXTY DAYS WE WERE WAS NOT HARD. SO WE JUST NEED SOMETIME BILL A FLESH THOSE OUT -- WONDERFUL SO THAT SOMEONE ARE KIND OF GO BACK AND TERM -- RECAP A FEW OF THE THINGS BUT JUST SO I CAN. CLARIFY BECAUSE AYE I DO WANT TO GUARANTEE I KNOW MISS FRIEDMAN LAUGHED BUT I'M GONNA. GUARANTEE EVERYBODY WHO SPENT ABOUT TWO PLUS HOURS HERE THAT ALL OF THESE COMMENTS WILL BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. I AND IT'S UP TO MYSELF AND MR FRAZIER NO MISTER BLOOM WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE HE UNFORTUNATELY IS DOING A TOUR OF OUR FIRES RIGHT NOW AS I'M SURE HE'D MUCH RATHER BE WITH US THAN ON HIS TOUR. AND URGE THEM TO LEFT ARE THREE COMMITTEES TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT -- ALL OF THESE ISSUES IS THAT WERE REYES BIRD DUH WHO RESOLUTIONS WILL BE DONE. ON SO WE TALKED ABOUT HOPEFULLY TOWARD THE END OF DECEMBER -- SEEN -- SOME RESOLUTION AND GOING BACK TO A PRE REAL ID -- WAIT TIMES IS THAT. THERE IS OUR GOAL THAT'S OUR GOAL WONDERFUL. BECAUSE YOU DID MENTION I BELIEVE JULY SIXTEENTH STARTING THE E. DRIVER SLIDE THE ELECTRONIC DRIVER'S LICENSE APPLICATIONS AYE. I MISS I MUST HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD SOMETHING BECAUSE AND YOU ALSO MENTIONED A MID SEPTEMBER IMPLEMENTATION SO SO IT JULY SIXTEENTH WE OFFERED OF THAT IS BEING A PUBLIC THROUGH OUR WEBSITE YOU CAN. COMPLETE THE DRIVER'S LICENSE APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMFORT OF YOUR HOME OF YOUR SMART DEVICE AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER WE WILL INTEGRATE. THAT ELECTRONIC -- INFORMATION THE FILLED UGLY TIGHTLY INTEGRATE THAT INTO A DRIVERS LICENSE SYSTEM SO I TECHNICIANS WON'T HAVE TO KEEP THAT INFORMATION. GOT A RIGHT SO RIGHT NOW. I CAN GO AND ENTER THAT INFORMATION. BUT IF I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TOMORROW. THAT INFORMATION CAN BE DOWNLOADED IS THAT WHERE YOUR INSIGHT YOU CAN. DO THAT FOR ALL THE ELECT ILLUSION THAT TANAKA APPLICATION IN OUR FIELD OFFICE TO A TOUCH SCREEN TERMINAL AND THEN WHEN YOU CAN YOU DO THAT FIRST. AND THEN WHEN YOU GET CALLED TO THE TECHNICIAN WINDOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BRING THAT UP PREFER AS WHAT BUT WE HAVE TO STILL KEY THAT AND SO THE INTEGRATION WALCHER IN SEPTEMBER WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP IT TIMOTHY SYSTEMS DON'T TALK JUST YET TALK TO EACH OTHER. AND SO THE TECHNICIAN TO BRING UP THE INFORMATION YOU KEY DAM AND THEN THEY HAVE TO THEM TO GET INTO. THE ACTUAL SYSTEM IN IT WHAT A WISE TECHNICIANS INPUTTING DATA INTO. AS A AS A WORKSTATION FOR PEOPLE TO AND PUT THAT INFORMATION RIGHT NOW. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW WHERE WE DID THIS IN PHASES AND OFFER ELECTRONIC APPLICATION THAT BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOMERS CAN -- COMPLETE THAT AND AND AND WE FIND THAT IT'S MORE INTUITIVE BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS INFORMATION IN TERMS OF VETERANS PREFERENCES POINTS IN -- AND ORGAN DONOR SO THERE'S MORE INFORMATION THAT AS YOUR COMPLAINT APPLICATION. BEFORE THE PATRIOT THE FLIP BACK AND FORTH THAT YOU CAN GO AND YOU CAN CLICK AND YOU CAN GET MORE INFORMATION RIGHT THERE IS A MORE INTUITIVE APPLICATION. OF FOR THE CUSTOMER TO UNDERSTAND -- WHAT WERE THE QUESTIONS WE'RE ASKING IT'S VERY INTUITIVE AND THEN WE'RE GETTING MORE UP ACCURATE INFORMATION IN TERMS OF SPELLING? OF NAMES AND ADDRESSES SO SINCE THE JULY SIXTEENTH IMPLEMENTATION ARE YOU SEEING A REDUCTION IN TIME -- WHICH SAYS WE JUST LAUNCHED THAT WE OR STILL -- TRITE SEEM TO SEE IF THAT IS A REDUCTION IN TIME AND SO WE JUST ONCE THAT STEP. JULY SIXTEENTH AND WE ARE STILL SEEING AND SEE THAT. AND WHAT PEOPLE COMPLETED ONLINE AND SEE THAT -- AN AFFECT ON THE REDUCTION OF THE TIME. BUT THAT ALSO PEOPLE COMING IN AND GOING TO KEY AUSTIN FILLING THAT INFORMATION OUT RIGHT. THERE WE ARE AND AND HAVE YOU NOT SEEN ANY IMPACT. AT THIS POINT [inaudible] OF LOVE SO THEY ARE KEEN IF THEY'RE GOING INTO OFFICE AND IN FILLING IT OUT QUIRK AND WE ARE IN SO THAT SAVES WERE WERE THERE NOT COMPETE ON PAPER SO WE WILL SEE THE IMPACT WHEN WE DO THE FULL INTEGRATION WERE IT IS KEY THAT CAR CALLED UP INTO OUR DRIVER'S LICENSES. THAT'S WHAT WE JUST SAID SO WHAT YOU JUST SAID WAS FAT RIGHT NOW IF I AM GOING TO A KIOSK WITHIN THE DMV OFFICE. IT'S MORE INTUITIVE I FILL IN ALL THE INFORMATION I GIVE THAT INFORMATION TO THE CLERK YOU ARE SAYING BASED ON YOU JUST SAID BASED ON THAT THAT THERE. IT SHOULD BE EASIER FOR EVERYBODY SO ARE. ARE ARE YOU IN FACT SEEING A REDUCTION TIME TO USE BODIES BECAUSE WHAT'S THE POINT OF GOING WHAT'S THE POINT OF ME. GOING TO A KIOSK TYPING ALL THIS INFORMATION AND GIVING IT TO A CLERK AND NOT HAVING ANY REDUCTION TIME ONE I JUST GIVE THE CLERK A WRITTEN APPLICATION. EITHER WAY YOU WOULD FILL OUT THE ELECTRONIC APPLICATION ORIGINALLY BEFORE THE JULY SIXTEENTH DATE WHEN WE HAVE INDIVISIBLE OF THE FIELD OFFICE YOU HAD TO GO TO ADD A TOUCH SCREEN TERMINAL. AND YOU FILL OUT THE ELECTRONIC APPLICATION AT THAT POINT INSULT COME JULY SIXTEENTH WE HAVE THE ABILITIES TO FILL OUT THE APPLICATION ARM ELECTRONICALLY IN THE FIELD OFFICE. OR AT HOME THE REDUCTION OF TIME WOULD WOULD REALLY BE WITH APPOINTMENT CUSTOMERS BECAUSE IF YOU HAD AN APPOINTMENT. ARM YOU'RE GOING TO THE FIELD OFFICE APPOINTMENTS ARM A MUCH SHORTER WAIT TIME IN SOME OF YOU HAD TO GO FILL OUT THE APPLICATION I'M AFTER YOU GOT YOUR TO TAKE IT. HOME LIBYA A SLOWER PROCESS SO THE PRE FILLED IT OUT YOU GOTTA Q. TICKET NEVER OPPORTUNITY GET CALLED A LOT FASTER. I'M INDIVIDUALS THAT DON'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WHAT'S TRANSPIRING IS MOST ON THEIR GET THEIR QUEUE TO GET IN THE WAY TIME IS IS LONG ENOUGH TO WHERE THEY THEN GO AND FILL OUT THE APPLICATION AFTER THEY HAVE THAT YOU TAKE IT. SO WHAT WISER NO CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN TIME THE FUN FILLING IT OUT AT HOME. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AT HOME OR YOU FILL OUT AFTER YOU GET THE Q. TICKET THAT THEY'RE STILL HAVE THE THE WAY TIME OF THE OF THE SAY THE COUPLE OF HOURS. THEY GET THE DON'T WANT SO Y. WITH US IMPLEMENTED PRIOR TO THE MID SEPTEMBER WHY EVEN. LAUNCH IT BEFORE THEN. SO WE WE WANNA MISSILES LIKE YOU'RE JUST WASTING MY TIME. WHERE OR ANY MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION FROM THE CUSTOMER IN TERMS OF THAT OKAY INFORMATION BEING COLLECTED? YOU HAVE TO FILL OUT EITHER WAY AND DO SO YOURS. YOU KNOW AGAIN I MEAN ARM. SO ARE YOU SAVING TIME IN US INTO. BUT IT'S WHAT WHERE NOT SEEN TIME RIGHT NOW WHAT DID FULL INTEGRATION WE WILL SAVE TIME AND WHY DID YOU IMPLEMENT THIS NOW WEST PURSES WAITING FROM ITS TIMBER. THEY'RE THE REASON WHY WE WENT TO ALLOW THAT THE CUSTOMERS THE FULLER HOME IS BECAUSE I'M IF WE DIDN'T OFFER THAT OPPORTUNITIES THEN THERE WAS A BACKLOG AT THE TOUCH SCREEN TERMINALS TO FILL OUT THE APPLICATION IN THE FIELD OFFICES SO THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD. THEN BE WAITING FOR THE I SCREEN TO POP UP FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO NAM FILL OUT THE APPLICATION. SO IS EVERYBODY WAS SAYING THAT OFFERING IT -- OF PUBLIC KEY DO YOU CAN FILL OUT FROM YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN AT HOME A WE WERE SEEING SOME CONGESTION IN TERMS OF IT FREES UP THE OFFICE SPACE CENTER OF THE TOUCH SCREEN TERMINAL THE CUSTOMERS. DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE IN SO REDUCE IN THE WORK OF THE OFFICE WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO OVER TO THAT TOUCH CREE. TERMINAL TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATION YOU COMPLETED FROM YOUR WHOLE SO WE ARE SEEING SOME EFFICIENCIES IN TERMS OF THE WORK FLOW. OUT WE WILL SEE THE EFFICIENCIES IN TERMS OF TIME SAVINGS WHEN WE DO THE FOREIGN AGGRESSION. I YOU'D MENTION FROM -- COULD YOU MENTION THAT YOU'RE SENDING OUT NOTIFICATIONS FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE RENEWALS FROM SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS. A WORSENING THEN -- STARTING ON I THINK AND APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH THOSE NOTICES THE MONTH OF AUGUST IS THE AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH. I WILL BEGIN SEEING THOSE OUT OF NINETY TWO HUNDRED DAYS EARLIER BECAUSE IT WAS SIXTY TO NINETY NOW CAN BE NINETY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS EARLIER SO THEN -- AT WE MAKE APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE NINETY DAYS OUT IT SHOULD START TO MATCH UPLAND PUT MISTER AVAILABLE SERVES UP SOME SIDE SO THAT THAT'S WHY I WAS CONFUSED TOO WHICH WHICH WHICH NOTICES ARE GOING OUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS VERSUS NINETY TO SUCH A PRETTY LARGE DRIVERS LICENSE IDENTIFICATION. RENEWALS DETECTIVES CUT CARDINALS WILL BE GOING OUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS IN ADVANCE AND THEN NINETY DAYS IN ADVANCE WILL BE. NO IT'S NOT SO THE MAILING THE PROCESS WE START THE PROCESS OF WRITING THE WE KNOW NOTICES AND GAINED IN THE MAIL. THAT IS STARTING AT A HIGH JUNE TWENTY DAYS OUT IN SO BY THE TIME WE DO ALL THAT PROCESS IT SHOULD BE PROBABLY ABOUT NIGHT HUNDRED DAYS THAT IT ACTUALLY. ARRIVES AT A CUSTOMER'S MAILBOX WHICH WOULD MATCH IT WITH AN APPOINTMENTS BE AVAILABLE NIGHT AUDIT SO I AYE SO I SHOULD BE. RECEIVING MY NOTICE LET'S SAY. HUNDRED TO NINETY DAYS IN MY MAILBOX. OKAY. SO WHILE WE WERE HERE BECAUSE I TWENTY OF TIME TO GET ON MY TABLET. I I TRIED TO GET AN APPOINTMENT AT MY LOOK [inaudible] THE IT WAS ON THE FOR OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH WHICH I I CAN'T DO BECAUSE THE FOOTBALL I'M I CAN DUKE SENATE RECESS BUT I CAN'T DO. I IT FROM NOT DIE AT HOME ON A THURSDAY. ON BUT AGAIN THAT'S SIXTY EIGHT DAYS IN ADVANCE AND THAT'S ASSUMING THAT THE SECOND I GOT MY NOTIFICATION. THAT I RAN TO MY COMPUTER TO GET AN APPOINTMENT [inaudible] WHICH IS. NOT TRADITIONALLY NORMAL HUMAN BEHAVIOR. SO ON A GIVEN THAT I REPRESENT REGULAR PEOPLE -- WHAT I MEAN WHAT WATER AGAIN WE GIVE YOU AND I HAVE THIS CONVERSATION? I'LL Y. Y. PICK A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS ONE ECHO SIX MONTHS ONE DOG A YEAR. WHY ARE YOU STRESSING NOW CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE GETTING THESE NOTIFICATIONS AND THEN PANICKING AND THEN OF COURSE? ON YOU KNOW WHY I LOVE HIM FOR MY CONSTITUENTS -- THAN THEY CAN YOU KNOW MISS PALACES CONSTITUENTS ARE CALLING HIM HIS BIGGEST CONSTITUENTS ARE CALL HIM MISTER FREEZE. I MEAN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET AN APPOINTMENT -- WE YOU KNOW WITHIN THE TIME FRAME TO GET A LICENSE RENEW. SO DURING THIS TIME HI I IMAGINED THAT ON YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. UPDATING SOME SISTERS BUT REALLY IF THIS IS A COMPUTER -- SOFTWARE ISSUE WHY NOT EXTEND OUT THE PERIOD FAR IN ADVANCE I KNOW WHEN I GET MY VEHICLE REGISTRATION. IT FEELS LIKE I'M GETTING AT YOU KNOW. SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OR FIVE MONTHS IN ADVANCE OR SOMETHING WELL I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF TO PAY IT ARE -- LOOK MUCH LATER ON WHY NOT SEND IT MUCH FURTHER. ARE IN ADVANCE SO PEOPLE HAVE. PLENTY OF TIME SO THAT WE DON'T GET CALLS AGAIN THE POINT THAT. GILL WELL INTO THE FUTURE AND NOT FEEL STRESSED ABOUT RENEWING THAT LICENSE BEFORE OR AFTER IT EXPIRES. SO THERE IS THERE IS A CONCERN TO PEOPLE FORGET AND THEN THEY FEEL THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET IN AND THEY ARE NOT RENEWING THEIR LICENSE THERE WOULD BE DRIVING WITH AN EXPIRED LICENSE AND IF THEY GET STOP ALONG FOR THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THEY WOULD NOT. BE DRY WITH A VALID LICENSE IF THEY FORGOT THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A REAL CONCERN. WILL BEGIN YOU KNOW -- AND MADE MAYBE IN THIS BAKER STE TWO HUNDRED NOTE PILE THERE'S PEOPLE WHO HAVE FORGOTTEN BUT IT SEEMS TO BE. THE BIGGER ISSUE IS PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING TO GO IN RIGHT AWAY -- AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY IN THAT LIST OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE FORGOTTEN TO GO GET THEIR LICENSE ONE THERE'S ONE PERSON WHO FRIGHTENED PERSON TO ENSURE TO GO BACK FOUR TIMES. SO THERE SO THERE IS ONE BUT I AGAIN I THINK THIS IS AFFECTING THE LIKE THAT YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW WE ARMED. I KNOW FOR A FACT WE HAVE GOT A NUMBER BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT THE DATA RIGHT HERE FOR MY A DATABASE. BUT THAT WE HAVE GOT A NUMBER OF CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO -- WERE PANICKING BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GET AN APPOINTMENT -- PRIOR -- TO THE EXPIRATION OF A DRIVER'S LICENSE I THINK THAT -- IT IS IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE I'M. IT IN TERMS OF WAITING OUTSIDE I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT IF I YOU KNOW WHEN I GO BY DRIVE BY MY DMV ON THURSDAY ON MY WAY HOME WHAT AM I GOING TO SEE. AT LIKE THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO DMP. MOTHER TO SEE PEOPLE OUTSIDE WE ARE WORKING TO BRING THOSE PEOPLE INSIDE -- WE ARE GOAL IS FOR THOSE IF YOU DRIVE BY THAT THEY ARE NOT STAND OUTSIDE WERE WORKING AT TO GET THOSE PEOPLE TRIAGE AND INSIDE THE OFFICE IT IN IN ONE SITUATION WITH THE P. OUTSIDE IS A IS A BECAUSE EVERY SEATS ALREADY BEEN. TAKEN. THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THAT THAT OF WE ARE FULL BUT WE ARE WORKING TO GET THOSE CUSTOMERS SERVE FASTER IT WOULD BE WHERE. OF WE ARE WORKING THAT LINE IT'S BE WORRIED THAT EVERY SEAT IS TAKEN ARE NOT ABLE TO GET INSIDE. WELL POP PART OF THE ISSUE NOW IS AS I MENTIONED WHEN I STARTED MY COMMENTS IS THAT PEOPLE ARE WAITING. AT HOURS IN ADVANCE OF THE DMV OPENING. SO EVEN BEFORE THAT DOORS OPEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE LINING UP AT SIX AM IN THE MORNING. AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AND UNDERSTAND HOW HOW'RE YOU. SORT OF ACCOMMODATING ADAPT DURATION ARE YOU JUST WAIT EDU DOT NOT OPEN THE GATES ARE JUST LETTING PEOPLE LINED UP. MAY BECAUSE HAVING EVEN PEOPLE WAY FOR TWO HOURS -- BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT OPENS IS IS CONCERNING. SO WE AND IT WAS SO WE ARE -- MAKE IT SHARING THAT WE'RE TO GUN LYING IN IF WE CAN GET YOU IN EARLY BECAUSE WE GET START APPLICATION AND DOING THE ELECTRONIC FORTY FOUR WE GET INSIDE -- FOURTEEN OFFICES DO OPEN OUR EARLY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK WIENER STAND PEOPLE LINE UP SO WE ARE ALLOWING CUSTOMERS WE DO OPEN HOURLY BECAUSE IF WE CAN GET A BIG JUMPS ON THE DAY. OUT BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING CUSTOMERS LINED UP AND SO WE HAVE DONE THAT OPEN FOURTEEN HOURS HOW WE ARE LOW AFFLICTING OFFICES ARE LOOKING TO SEE. THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO OPEN ADDITIONAL OFFICES EARLIER. AND SO WE CAN GET THOSE CUSTOMERS INSIGHTS INTO WHOSE IS LIFTED UP THE LINE OF PEOPLE GOING AROUND THE BLOCK OR OF A HUNDRED OR SO PEOPLE. ON IT IS A REASON WHY EVEN IF THEY CAN'T BE HAPPEN SEATED INSIDE THAT THEY CAN'T GET. THEIR TICKET AND THEN. LIKE YOU SAID. SO I AT IN A COUPLE IS IS IS -- RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING OUTSIDE -- AND IN THE WAITING TO GET INSIDE OR TO GET EIGHT A TICKET IS IS THERE A REASON WHY WE'RE FORCING THEM TO WAIT INSIDE VERSUS CAN THEY JUST GO GET A TICKET AND SUPERSTAR GO GET COFFEE NEXT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OR KUWAIT SOMEWHERE ELSE OR GO WAIT IN THE CAR FRANKLY. AND SO SO THAT IS HOW WE ARE ABLE TO SEND CUSTOMERS TO THE RIGHT WINDOW FOR IT TO TRAINED TECHNICIANS DO THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE VEHICLE REGISTRATION SO WHAT IF THINGS IS YOU NEED TO GET THAT TICKET -- WE ARE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING IDENTIFYING HOW MANY TECHNICIAN HAVE WORK IN THE WINDOWS AND THAT THOSE ARE NOT CUSTOMERS ARE GIVEN A TICKET IMMEDIATELY AT FORCING THE VOICES THE DOORS OPEN THEIR HEADED THERE. PRACTICE STRAIGHT TO THOSE WINDOWS WE CAN GET PEOPLE AND A LOT SOONER IN THE MORNING OUT JUMPSTART SO WHERE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS GETTING CUSTOMERS AND SOONER BECAUSE YOU SAID THERE ARE WORKING AND SO WE ARE TREATING EYEING THE LINE. IN THE MORNING TO SEE. WHO HAS WHAT TYPE OF TRANSACTION DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DOCUMENTS AND SO THEN IF YOU NEED TO GO HOME AND GET YOUR DOCUMENT READY TO COME BACK OR GIVING AN APPOINTMENT SO WE ARE WORKING -- TO MAKE IT A BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE TO NOT HAVE TO WAIT IN THAT LINE BUT THE WHAT COULD YOU JUST GIVE IT TO BE A NUMBER. AND THEN. YOU KNOW WHY WHY WHY DO I HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE OUTSIDE FOR THREE HOURS BEFORE I CAN TALK TO THE TECHNICIAN. SO WILL IT WILL GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK THAT YOU'RE SAYING GIVE SOMEBODY AT A NUMBER THEY CAN GO IT AMELIE SIT DOWN THEY WILL CALL THAT NUMBER AND GET READY TO START YOUR WINDOW I MEAN YOU HAD YOU HAVE I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE FIVE PEOPLE. IN LINE YOU HAVE SOMETIMES A HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE GOING ON THE BLOCK IS FRIEDMAN TALKED ABOUT THE HEAT. ARM ADDITION. I DID IT IT'S IT SEEMS WE ARE TO MAKE PEOPLE WAIT IN LINE TO GET A TICKET. SO WILL GO BACK AND WILL EXPLORE THAT FURTHER -- GOING GOING BACK TO THE FIVE HUNDRED AND AND FIFTY ARM -- POSITIONS THAT YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING WHERE IF THEY'D BEEN DEPLOYED. SO THEY HAVE JAY COULD YOU SHARE THIS WITH US AND I DO HAVE THAT LIST DONE. AND COULD YOU GIVE SOME EXAMPLES OF WHERE -- BUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING. SO AND THE UP WITH THE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THAT WE'VE GOT. FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THEY'RE BEING DEPLOYED TO AND QUITE A MADERA DALY CITY AND A PETALUMA. SAN FRANCISCO IS GETTING. THREE AND WE HAVE -- FREMONT WE HAVE SAN JOSE WE HAVE SEE SIGH JUST TO GIVE YOU A FLAVOR. NOT ONLY HAVE BACK AVAIL WE HAVE CONQUERED CARMICHAEL DAVIS WE HAVE -- FRESNO IN IN THE JUST TO MAYBE IF YOU COULD JUST PICK. PARTICULAR I'M I'M NOT GONNA YOU NOT TALK BY SAN FRANCISCO BE YOU COULD TALK ABOUT A WHATEVER YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU AND JUST MAYBE TALK US THROUGH SOME OF THE POSITIONS HOW YOUR TO POINT THEM TO SO WE GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. THAT POSITIONS ARE BEING DEPLOYED TO THE OFFICES WITH THE HIGHEST WEEK TIME COURSE AND SO HIGHEST UP VOLUME OF DRIVER'S LICENSE AND HIGHEST QUALITY TO RELY DE. REQUESTED CARD SO THAT'S WHERE THE PLACE IT WOULD OF BEING WHERE THEY WERE THE BAGASSE DIRECT FOUR FOUR ZERO I THINK IT'S MISTER CARMICHAEL WITH COMICAL PASTOR. IN TERMS OF THEM PLATE ARE GOING TO BE PLACED THERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE -- FIRST ARE GOING -- TO WORK IN TRIAGE LINE GET FILLED WITH THE CUSTOMERS EITHER BECAUSE MY EXPERIENCE AND THEN THEY WILL GO TO TRAINING IN TERMS OF LEARNING OTHER DRIVERS LICENSE VEHICLE REGISTRATION PROCESS. AND THEN THEY'LL BE ON A WINDOW PROCESSING CUSTOMERS. GOT IT ARE AND IN STATE -- FOR CARMICHAEL HOW MANY EMPLOYEES WERE HIRED FULLER. THE DISC COMMUNITY ZAMBONI JUST MISSED EXAMPLES OF WHAT HAS BECAUSE I I KNOW FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY POSITION SOUNDS LIKE A LOT MISTER FRAZIER MATTER HOW HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OFFICERS. HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO OFFICE HER SUBJECT OFFICES WHICH IS LIKE YOU KNOW LEFT LESS THAN. FOUR FIVE PEOPLE PER OFFICE. SO AND POSITIONS ARE BEING ALLOCATED I WANTED TO OFFICES THAT HAVE THE HIGHER WAIT TIME OF COURSE. SO THAT'S WHERE THE PLACE MS CARMICHAEL'S GETTIN WHEN WITH ADDITIONAL REQUEST -- FOR THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY CHI MAK CARMICHAEL WE GET. TO A WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TO MONITOR THE PLACEMENT OF OF WHAT THE EMPLOYEE SHOULD GO OKAY SO WHAT WHAT I NOTICE IN THE WHEN THE ONE TIME THAT I WAS IN LINE IT'S A FRANCISCO. WAS THAT AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE SIDE A VERY VERY FROM THE TRIAGE STAFF PERSON VERY INCREDIBLY -- NICE PERSON BUT SHE WAS AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE. AND SO IT WOULD PROBABLY BY MY ESTIMATION TAKE AN HOUR OR TWO OR THREE TO EVEN GET TO HER SO TOM. YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS MAKING EVERYBODY WAIT BEFORE THEY EVEN GET TRIAGE. SO HOW HOW MUCH TIME OUR PEOPLE HAVING TO WAIT BEFORE THE EVEN THE TRIAGE. SO AND SO THAT THE TRIAGE PERSON WITH SOME AT SOME OFFICES WE HAVE ONE OR TWO PEOPLE OUT THEIR TREE I SEEN SO THAT WE CAN GET THROUGH THE LINE FASTER. IN SO AYE WE WANT TO DEFTLY GET THROUGH EVERYBODY. SO WE HAVE YOU KNOW IT TRAINED ON THE BIG OFFICES SHOULD BE TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE TREE AYE FUTURE SOLVE REPEAT MY QUESTION BECAUSE IT CLEARLY DIDN'T -- WAS AN ANSWER ARE HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE BEFORE THE PERSON GETS. TO THE TRIAGE PERSON. HOLLOW SO SO YOU SO YOU SO I I GET THERE MET MISS MISTER FRAZIER GET SIR I GET THE RIGHT BEHIND. YOU SAID YOU GIVE EVERYBODY A TICKET WITH. YOU KNOW IT IS NOW 630- SO THIRTY MISTER FREEZE ABOUT TICKET I GOTTA TAKE A THING. SIX THIRTY ONE WHAT TIME DOES A TRIAGE PERSON TAKE THE TICKET. THAT HURT THE TRASH PORTION -- GIVES A CUSTOMER'S A TICKET YET I'D YOUR TALK ABOUT THE SERVICE TICKET AYE WHY YOU MADE YOU MENTIONED THAT THE SECOND I GET TO THE PROMISES YOU'RE STARTING TO GIVE PEOPLE. ARE THE TIME THAT THEY GOT THERE SO SO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I GET TO THE NEXT. CHECK POINT BUT WHATEVER CHECKPOINT THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK. OKAY SO MY EXPERIENCE WAS THE TRIAGE PERSON WASN'T IN THE BACK OF THE LINE THE TRIAGE PERSON WAS IN THE FRONT OF THE OUTSIDE LINE THIS IS THE OUT. WERE JUST TALKING US ON THE RIGHT TO TALK TO THE INSIDE. SO. GET THE LINE GOING AROUND THE BLOCK. SURE I GOT. I ASSUME SOMETHING THAT SAID HEY I GOT HERE AT SIX THIRTY PM SO. SO WE HOW TO TAKE YOUR MODELS AND TAKING ME TO GET TO THE TRIAGE PERSON SO WE ARE MARCHING ON OUR THE FEELS PERSON GIVES IT A A CAR TO THE LAST PERSON IN LINE SO WE CAN MONITOR. YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S TAKING THAT PERSON TO GET TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE. IN SO THAT IS WHERE WE ARE -- ON OUR JOINT MONITORING HOW LONG IT TAKES BEFORE BECAUSE WE GET TO THAT TO GET TO THE START HERE WITH ELEVENTH SO IN THE TRIAGE PERSON. GIVES ME THE SIX THIRTY PM CARD. THEY'RE ASKING ME DO I YOU KNOW MY HERE TO PICK BUT LICENSE MY HERE BECOME A PLACARD IS OUT. YET SO THEY SHOULD BE TRIAGE IN THE LINE AND THEN ON OUR AT THE LAST PERSON LIKE GIVING THEM A CARD TO WE CAN IDENTIFY HOA IT'S TAKING THEM TO GET TO THE FRONT OF THE FINAL LINES. SO I THINK YOU YOU HAVE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S OCCURRING BECAUSE AGAIN IF YOU HAVE ONE TRAILS PERSON IN THEIR JOB IS TO MANAGE THE EXTERIOR LINE. AS WELL AS TRIAGE PERSON. WHAT I NOTICE IS THERE THEY'RE MANAGING THE LINE? BAD THEY'RE NOT IN THE BACK OF THE LINE DURING THE FINAL. THEY SHE SAID THEY SHOULD BE WORKING THE WHOLE LINE. AND IT MAY TAKE THEM AWHILE TO GET THROUGH EVERYBODY AND AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ENOUGH. PEOPLE OUTSIDE TRIAGE IN LINE MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAS A DEBT TALK TO AND DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE YOUR VISIT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. WHAT WE THINK IT GOES BACK TO I THINK ALL ALL MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON FOR ANYBODY? TO YOU KNOW QUOTABLE WAIT IN A LINE RIGHT WHAT THEY HAVE A TICKET OR THEY HAVE THEY'VE KIND OF CORTICAL CHECKED IN. THEY THEY THEY SHOULD BE. HANG OUT SOMEONE THE PREMISES OR SOMEWHERE NEARBY BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE. YOU KNOW. STANDING UP AGAIN THE YOU'RE THE THIRD THESE ARE LEGAL ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES YOU CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE. TO SAID HOW ARE BEING A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE TO STAND IN A LINE -- FOR HOURS NOT OFFERED THEM SOME LEVEL OF ACCOMMODATION. SO THAT THAT'S IT THAT'S COULD VERY CONCERNING FROM JUST A LEGAL LIABILITY STANDPOINT. SO THAT I MEAN THAT WILL GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IN TERMS OF OF WHAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT. I CAN'T WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THE CUSTOMERS INSIDE THE LINE AND NOT HAVE INSIDE OFFICE AND I HAVE TO WAIT OUT ALSO I OR AT LEAST DISPERSE RIGHT I CAN'T BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PASS ISSUES OF EVERY SEAT IN THE OFFICE BEEN TAKEN. THEN THEY HAVE TO BE DISPERSED YOU KNOW AGAIN DIED IN GENERAL PEOPLE ARE THERE WITH THEIR VEHICLES I CAN GO SIT IN THE CAR. ME HOPEFULLY THERE'S NO COFFEE SHOP OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW CLOSE BY WHERE THEY COULD THEY COULD WAIT ARM. BUT MAKING YOU KNOW MAKING THEM STAND FOR THREE HOURS DOESN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE A GOOD USE OF FRANKLY ANYBODY START. ARMED. SO YOU SO YOU DEPLOYED THERE -- FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR SO OP POSITIONS HOW ARE. HOW HAS IT BEEN GOING IN TERMS OF SEEING COME INTERMEDIATE REDUCTION OF WAIT TIMES AND HOW HOW LONG BEFORE WE START TO SEE THE IMPACT OF THAT? APPOINTMENT OF NEW STAFF. SO AS I SIT SO WE ARE MEASURING THE WAIT TIMES AND SO WE ARE WATCHING OUT WHERE THOSE -- EMPLOYEES ARE BEING DEPLOYED AND WATCHING THE WAIT TIMES IN THOSE OFFICES WHERE WE WANT TO SEE THE IMPACT OF THE COST OF THE TWO TECHNICIANS BEING TRAINED BILL TO SERVE THE CUSTOMERS AND OUT WATCHING TO SEE THAT THE WAIT TIMES TO GO DOWN. THERE ARE TRACKING THAT OKAY AS SIZE AS YOU'VE DEPLOYED PEOPLE HAVE WHAT WHAT'S BEEN DONE OF PROGRESS. SO AND SO WE HAVE. JUST I PLAYED THOSE WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS SO WE ARE AYE IT WOULD GET W. I'VE A BILL TO GIVE TO REPORT IN TERMS OF OF PROGRESS THAT WE SING. AND THE ADDITIONAL TO EDITOR THERE ASKING FOR YOU KNOW THOSE ARE WE'RE STILL WAITING TO SEE IF WE CAN GET PERMISSION TO HIRE THOSE TO SEE WHETHER WE HAVE HAD THAT PROGRESS IS SO SO JUST GOT CALLED BACK TO THE CARMICHAEL SIMPLY YOU BROUGHT IN ONE POSITION. MEET REAL REALISTICALLY HOW MUCH IMPROVEMENT COULD YOU REALLY EXPECT WITH ONE POSITION. AND SO WE WILL. BE ABLE TO OF PUT THAT PERSON A TRAINING AND THEN. A COUPLE I KNOW A TRAINED PERSON CAN SERVICE ABOUT FIFTY PEOPLE A DAY SO WE WOULD HOPE TO SEE THAT WITH THAT WE ABILITY REDUCTION. I IN THE WAIT TIMES BECAUSE A TECHNICIAN CAN PROCESS MORE CUSTOMERS SO WILL MEASURE THAT. IT IN IN THIS SO THEY COULD SERVE FIFTY MORE PEOPLE DAVE HOW MANY HOW GROUP ROUGHLY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING. ARM SERVED AT VERB YOU KNOW ROUGHLY THAT THAT LOCATION. THAT DEPENDS ON THE ON THAT THE DIFFERENT RATES OF OFFICE IS THE NUMBER EMPLOYEES DON'T HAVE WORKING SO AND IF COULD BE AND I DON'T HAVE THAT TRANSACTION NUMBER HAVE SOME OF OUR LARGER OFFICES ARE SEEN EIGHT HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED CUSTOMERS A DAY. AS AS YOU WOULD KNOW AND AND EVEN IN YOUR DISTRICT. BUT BUT BUT AGAIN THAT'S AND THAT'S WHY I'M CONCERNED RICE WITH SO IN SAY IN THAT PARTICULAR OFFICE YOU ONLY ADDING. ONE PERSON TO DEMAND WHIMS AND WHAT TO DO FIFTY MORE FIFTY MORE TRANSACTIONS RIGHT IT SEEMS LIKE EIGHT EIGHT HOUR WAIT TIME NOW BECOMES A SEVEN AND A HALF HOUR WE TALK [inaudible] CORRECT. I MEAN IN THEORY THERE'S ARM. TO BE HONEST AND THAT THAT'S THOUGH THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT ADDITIONAL JAIL BC ASK ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY I'M POSITIONS. THAT EVEN TURN TO THIRTIES JUST ONE PERSON PROFITS. SO WHAT DO WHEN HE'S THAT WE ARE WE ARE MARCHING THE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS TO HAVE. ISSUED TICKETS FROM ARGUING SYSTEM [inaudible] WAITING AND THERE MAY BE S. IS WHERE OF OFFICE GETS BUSY AND THEY FOR ME FORGET TO CALL THAT CUSTOMER FROM THAT Q. TICKET AND WE'RE SEEING THAT AND SO THIS IS WHERE WE WILL ON REAL TIME SAY. I HAVE THERE'S A CUSTOMER THAT'S WHEN A LONG TIME YOU NEED TO CALL THAT TICKET CONSERVE THEIR THEIR BEEN IT'S IS WHERE I THINK THE OFFICES MAYOR FOR GONE TO COLLEGE TICKET. TO WEAR IRAQ'S ASKINGWHY IS A BECAUSE WE'RE WAITING SIX HOURS SEVEN HOURS SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THAT AND SO MARK IN THE THE KISSES IN RURAL TIME. BILL TO SEE THAT HAPPENING AND CALL THAT CUSTOMER THAT CUTE TICKETS SO BUT I'M GOING BACK TO THIS HUNDRED THIS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY POSITIONS AND PROSTITUTED THIRTY POSITIONS WHICH IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY POSITIONS. MEAN ON TO YOU EVEN HAVE ENOUGH. COMPUTERS -- TO STAFF ALL THOSE PEOPLE. AND AND AND WINDOWS SO YES WE DO SO WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TO STAFF THE ADDITIONAL HIGHER IS THAT WE'RE ASKING. FOR OKAY SO AS AS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED WHAT HAS BEEN. THE PRODUCTION TIME. SO YOU SAID YOU'VE NOW. STARTED TO DEPLOY A FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY OP DESCEND NO IT'S PHASED BUT AS YOU'RE DEPLOYING. THESE INDIVIDUALS HOPEFULLY YOU WILL SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY BEING ABLE TO SEE SOME. SO GRAYSON BASED ON THE OFFICE YOU KNOW WE BEAT THAT SIZE OF THE OFFICE BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN WE WE SAY ESTATE RIGHT THERE ARE OUTLINES WERE -- WAIT TIMES ARE A LOT HIGHER BUT STATEWIDE AVERAGE WE ARE SEEING A REDUCTION A WITHIN THREE TO FIVE MINUTES IN THE WAIT TIMES STATEWIDE SOME OFFICES ENEMY PER TRANSACTION -- YEAH YEAH. PER PERSON RIGHT SO. SO WE ARE WE ARE MARCHING TO SEE STATE WHY THE WAIT TIME IS IS GOING DOWN BUT WE KNOW AND WE UNDERSTAND WE HEAR FROM FROM EVERYBODY THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS THERE WAYNE AT SOARING AMOUNT TYPE. Y. WORK ON REDUCING THAT WE ARE SEEN WHERE WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE ARE WORKING TO REDUCE THAT TIME WE GO BACK AND GIVE YOU INFORMATION BY OFFICE WHERE RESPECT YOUR TRACKING THAT TO SEE. A REASON THAT REDUCTION IN THE WAIT TIMES SO SO I GUESS I MEAN FOR FOR FOR ME I YOU KNOW I DROPPED BY MY MY LOCAL OFFICE HE HERE'S HERE'S WHAT I'M I'M HEARING I SHOULD BE. EXPECTING TO HEAR HOPE HOPEFULLY NOBODY OUTSIDE. BUT IF THERE ARE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE SHOULD ALL HAVE A TICKET AS TO WHEN THEY ARRIVED -- ON ON PREMISES SERVICE OUTSIDE RESIDES RIGHT AND SO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GONNA TAKE THEM FROM THERE TO GET TO THEIR TICKET. AND THEN NOW YOU AND THEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE TIME THAT IT GETS FROM THE TICKET TO THE FRONT. WINDOW OVER RIGHT YEAH SO WHERE WE'RE WORKING ON OF THE LINE OUTSIDE THIS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS IT THAT'S WAIT OUTSIDE HAS A TICKET TO BE ABLE TO GET INSIDE IN GETS SEATED AND GET SIR. SO I THINK WHAT WHAT WHAT WE WHAT I'D WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE FOR THE CONTRA THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS SOME. ON SOME LEVEL OF RIP OF THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OR SO OFFICERS. AND WHAT THE BAND OF WAIT TIME IS NOT THE AVERAGE WEIGHT IN EARLY BUT IT IS AND WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE BAND WITH THE THINK EVERYBODY HERE. IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT. THAT THE DATA IS NOT REALLY REFLECTING THE REALITY OF AIRPORT OF WHAT SEEMED AND OR FEELING I MEAN -- I KNOW AUGUST IS A VERY VERY BUSY TIME THE FACT THAT SO MANY LEGISLATORS ALL CAME HERE AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WAS A REFLECTION THEIR LACK OF WORK BUT BILLY. OF THE ARMY AT THE FACT THAT OUR PHONES ARE REALLY BLOWN UP IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICES THAT THIS IS A MAJOR MAJOR CONCERN. AND THAT HIGH I DON'T KNOW THAT HOME. YET WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS CONTINUE ARE FOR THE NEXT YEAR FOR MONTHS SINCE JUST IF IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE A PROBLEM -- THEN IT ASSUMING THAT WE CAN GET APPROVAL FOR THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY POSITIONS HOW HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE YOU TO DEPLOY THEM. IT'S OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THEM -- HIRED BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER WE ALREADY HAVE BULLETINS ALREADY POSTED ANTICIPATION GAIN THE APPROVAL. AND ONCE WE GET APPLICANTS -- OF APPLYING WE HAVE HIRING INTERVIEW TEAMS OF HIRING TEAMS READY TO GO -- TO START GETTING THOSE -- EMPLOYEES OF WORKING AT THE GREAT. SO I'M YOU KNOW AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU YOUR WHOLE TEAM REALLY APPRECIATE ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR SPECIAL THE FEW COLLEGE A STUCK OUT THE WHOLE TIME -- BUT MIGHT MY COLLEAGUES FOR FOR FOR BEING HERE HOPE IT REALLY UNDERSCORES THE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF I INTEREST BUT WE WILL BE -- YOU FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WILL BE HOLDING ADDITIONAL HEARINGS OVER THE RECESS TO REALLY CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND -- HOW THE RESOURCES ARE DEPLOYED WHETHER THEY'RE BEING EFFECTIVE ON THEM YOU KNOW MY HOPE IS THAT WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HOPEFULLY SEE THAT -- DE SORT RESOURCES WERE ADVOCATE TO REALLY DRASTICALLY BRING DOWN THOSE LINES AND WE WON'T HAVE -- TO REVISIT THAT WE CAN JUST YOU KNOW.
