SIX. I HAVE TO SAY I AM. DEEPLY

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.868
DEEPLY CONCERNED. WITH THE

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.637
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:35.341
ALLOWING. PGA ANY ANOTHER

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.044
UTILITIES TO ENGAGE IN OUR

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.346
PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:43.349
WITH NOT NEARLY ENOUGH OUR

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:46.653
GUARD RAILS AND OVERSIGHT I IN

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.355
PLACE. AND I THINK WE ARE

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:51.891
CREATED A REGIMEWHERE THE

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.428
UTILITIES HAVE EVERY FINANCIAL

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:59.399
INCENTIVE TO ENGAGE AND- ARE ON

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.768
THE SIDE OF SHUTTING DOWN POWER.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:04.303
TO DO TO ENGAGE IN TOO MANY

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.239
POWER SHUT OFF ON THAT SIDE IN

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:09.909
ORDER TO AVOID LIABILITY. AND

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.411
TO MAKE THEM BROADER THAN DAY

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:14.747
PERHAPS NEED TO BE. BECAUSE THE

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.416
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THE

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:20.153
UTILITIES IS TO AVOID LIABILITY.

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.220
BUT THE COSTS OF THESE POWER

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:26.059
SHUT OFFS ARE MASSIVE. WHETHER

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.593
IT IS A SMALL CITY THAT HAS

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.562
BEEN POWER DOWN OR WHETHER AS

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.330
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IT COULD BE

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:33.332
THE ENTIRE CITY OF SAN JOSE OR

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:34.901
SAN FRANCISCO GETTING POWER

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.703
DOWN IF THAT'S WHAT HE'S YOU

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.971
NEED BESIDES IS NECESSARY

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:41.607
WHETHER IT'S FOR ITS PERCEPTION

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.910
OF SAFETY. FOR ITS OWN.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:47.413
AVOIDANCE OF LIABILITY BECAUSE

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.282
THE GRID IS IN SUCH POOR SHAPE

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:51.017
BECAUSE IT HASN'T OF P. GINNY

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:51.584
HAS NOT MAINTAINED THAT ARE

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:56.656
PROPERLY. TO SCRIPT PROPERLY.

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.691
IT'S WITH WIRES PROPERLY IT'S

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:01.327
INFRASTRUCTURE PROPERLY NOW AND

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:03.730
AS A RESULT A HUGE NUMBER OF

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:05.531
CALIFORNIANS INDIVIDUALS AND

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:06.699
BUSINESSES COULD BE LEFT

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:08.835
HOLDING THE BAG I'M PAYING THE

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.504
PRICE AND THE COSTS ARE REAL

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.239
WHEN POWER IS SHUT OFF WE KNOW

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:15.608
ABOUT HOSPITALS AND NURSING

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:16.709
HOMES AND SOME OF OUR MOST

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:20.246
VULNERABLE. RESIDENTS ARE

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:22.381
VULNERABLE INSTITUTIONS WE KNOW.

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:23.483
WHAT THE MASSIVE PROBLEMS ARE

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:24.317
THERE BUT IT GOES SO MUCH

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:27.453
DEEPER I'VE BEEN NOT. I WAS

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.822
JUST CONTACT THE LAST WEEK BY A

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.691
BUSINESS IN MY DISTRICT I WAS

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.059
INFORMED BY THEIR INSURANCE

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:34.827
COMPANY I THAT IF THEY

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.462
EXPERIENCE A POWER SHUT OFF IN

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.431
HUGE FINANCIAL LOSSES. THEIR

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:40.399
INSURANCE WILL NOT COVER IT

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:42.568
BECAUSE SINCE THEY GOT TWENTY

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:43.569
FOUR MAYBE FORTY EIGHT HOURS

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.838
NOTICE IT'S NOT A SIDE AND AN

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.975
UNPREDICTABLE. EVENTS IT IS A

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:51.778
PLAN SHUT DOWN AND SO THE DAY

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:53.146
WILL SUSTAIN MASSIVE FINANCIAL

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:55.214
LOSSES TENSELY PUTTING THEM OUT

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:57.283
OF BUSINESS AND THEY WILL NOT

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.986
HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE. FOR IT

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:03.289
I AND AS I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:03.890
THERE'S NO RECOURSE AGAINST P.

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:06.325
GINNY FOR DOING. AND I THINK IF

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.360
WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A SYSTEM

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:09.462
OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. FOR P.

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:12.165
GINNY IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.065
WE'RE GOING TO ERR ON THE SIDE

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:16.369
OF POWER SHUT OFFS. BECAUSE

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:17.003
WE'RE GOING TO AVOID LIABILITY

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.305
THERE HAS TO BE. A FINANCIAL

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:21.974
CONSEQUENCE ON THE OTHER SIDE

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:24.243
AS WELL IT IS NOT FAIR TO

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.812
REPAIRS IT'S NOT FAIR TO

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:28.281
BUSINESSES IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:31.217
MANY INDIVIDUALS WHOSE LIVES.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.452
WILL BE DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED.

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.221
BY POTENTIALLY VERY BROAD VERY

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.623
DANGEROUS AND VERY SUSTAINED

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.525
OUR POWER SHUTDOWNS. SO I'M

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:40.860
JUST BEING VERY VERY BLUNT

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.728
HERE. BECAUSE I'M VERY

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.063
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.465
WE SET UP I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:33.318
PREMISE OF THE WHICH WE OPERATE

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:35.921
IS THAT IT IS THE UTILITIES.

REASON TO SHUT THEM OFF. THE

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:57.642
IDEA BEHIND THIS IS SHUTTING

OFF POWER FOR RECEIVE TO REASON

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:02.414

THE SYSTEM ITSELF WHAT THE LESS

00:29:42.046 --> 00:29:44.415
LIKELY TO FORK OUT WHILE OUT

00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:46.885
FIRES AND THAT THOSE EFFORTS

00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:50.221
OVER TIME SHOULD REDUCE. THE

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:53.024
NEED TO FOR THE UTILITIES TO

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:56.895
SHUT OFF POWER. THE SECOND AREA

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:59.664
IS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF MY

00:29:59.731 --> 00:30:01.099
ALL SHUTTING OFF A PARTICULAR

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:03.268
LINE. CURRENTLY LEADS RELEASE

00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:05.303
OF THE FOR THE SYSTEM DESIGNS

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.738
THE SAN DIEGO SYSTEMS A LOT

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:08.106
MORE NETWORK THEM WHAT THAT

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:11.409
ALLOWS THEM TO DO IS TO BE

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:12.911
QUITE SURGICAL WHEN THERE'S

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:15.146
READING OFF A SPECIFIC LINE IN

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:17.081
MINIMIZING THE IMPACT OF THE

00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:19.317
CUSTOMERS LOSS OF LOAD THAT

00:30:19.384 --> 00:30:21.753
THAT ACTUALLY HOUSE. SO SOMEONE

00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:33.898
MMHM SOME OF THE. THE IS SHUT

00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:44.375
OFF ADVANCEMENT SING DIEGO. THE

00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:47.545
LARGELY REASON FOR THAT IS THE

00:30:47.612 --> 00:30:50.882
ACTUAL SYSTEM DESIGN WHERE THE

00:30:50.949 --> 00:30:53.418
THIS THE P. GENIES SAID THE

00:30:53.484 --> 00:30:57.188
SYSTEM IS RADIO VERSUS NETWORK

00:30:57.255 --> 00:30:58.223
LIKE WE HAVE IN THIS D. G. NEED

00:30:58.289 --> 00:31:01.359
TERRITORY. IT'S ELEMENT SINCE

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:04.162
IT DID SIX VERY LONG TIME A LOT

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:06.698
OF INVESTMENTS TO REDESIGN THE

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:08.933
GRANTED BUT IT'S WELCOME THE

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.603
GENIE IS SO AND OTHER UTILITIES

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:18.776
ARE ALSO MAKING INVESTMENTS. IN

00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:24.249
THAT AREA SO THAT WOULD. OVER

00:31:24.315 --> 00:31:26.851
TIME REDUCE THE IMPACT OF

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:28.152
SHUTTING OFF SPECIFIC LINES

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:31.522
THAT MIGHT BE RISKY. ELEMENT

00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:34.192
AND THEN L. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO

00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:35.760
OVERTIME GET BETTER IN TERMS OF

00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:36.961
I'LL RISK ASSESSMENT AND

00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:38.896
ABILITY TO PREDICT OF THE RISK

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.999
OF WILDFIRES IN THE VERY

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:45.837
SPECIFIC ELM. AND IT'S A VERY

00:31:45.903 --> 00:31:46.738
DEEP THE LEVEL OF GRANULARITY

00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:47.605
AND NOT AS ONE OF THE ISSUES

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:49.474
THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.242
THE RED FLAG WARNING SYSTEM IS

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:53.311
IT TOO HIGH A LEVEL FOR

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:56.547
UTILITIES TO OPERATIONALIZE.

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:59.484
THE V. IN THAT THOUGH SOLVING

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.386
THIS ISSUE BY DEPLOYING WEATHER

00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:04.422
STATIONS ON THEIR CIRCUITS ELM

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:06.190
AND GETTING MUCH MORE PRECISE

00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:08.192
INFORMATION. ABOUT THE

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:09.527
CONDITIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:11.296
WHERE THE FACILITIES ARE THE

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:13.031
CHALLENGE WITH THAT RIGHT NOW

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:16.701
IS THAT THERE'S NO SINGLE

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:18.736
THREATS IN BACKS THAT UNITES.

00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:22.206
EVERYBODY WHO RESPONDS TO

00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:28.713
WILDFIRE. KING ABOUT IT WELL

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.182
THAT SHOULD EASE SOME OF THE

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:33.151
CONFUSION THAT RIGHT NOW TAKES

00:32:33.217 --> 00:32:34.419
PLACE WHEN THE UTILITIES

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:37.088
COMMUNICATING ABOUT A POTENTIAL

00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:39.524
ALL SHOT OFF AND THE WILDFIRE

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.025
THROUGHOUT THE THERE YOU ARE

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:44.429
HOME. ASSESSING AND THEN LASTLY

00:32:44.495 --> 00:32:46.931
WITH COMMENTS ABOUT THE ISSUES

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:48.766
THAT HAVE COME UP AROUND OTH

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.501
THE IMPACT OF LOSS OF POWER IN

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:53.738
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND ON

00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:57.709
THE FIRST RESPONDERS. AND THE

00:32:57.775 --> 00:32:59.077
TO PAYING TO CANYON IS THE IS A

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:02.547
GOOD EXAMPLE OF OVAT WHERE IN

00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:03.548
THE SITUATION WHERE THEY LOSE

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:06.684
POWER. ELEMENT THE REALLY LOOSE

00:33:06.751 --> 00:33:07.985
GOOD OLD THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:10.655
CAPABILITIES SO IF THERE WAS AN

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:13.458
EMERGENCY IT JUST ABILITY TO

00:33:13.524 --> 00:33:14.492
TELL PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:17.729
HARM'S WAY AND COMMUNICATE IN

00:33:17.795 --> 00:33:19.464
THAT AREA BECOMES VERY VERY

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.700
LIMITED. BUT THE POWERS OF THE

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:23.935
PS FEELS PROGRAMS ARE EXPOSING

00:33:24.001 --> 00:33:26.471
IS THOSE CHALLENGES BUT THEY'RE

00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:28.539
NOT THE ONLY REASON WHY A LOSS

00:33:28.606 --> 00:33:29.574
OF POWER COULD TAKE PLACE AND

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.976
COMMUNITY SO I DO THINK THAT

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:33.111
THERE IS A BENEFIT TO THE FACT

00:33:33.177 --> 00:33:35.179
THAT THE PS PS PROGRAMS ARE

00:33:35.246 --> 00:33:36.914
EXPOSING THIS VULNERABILITY.

00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:39.484
THAT WE HEALTH BECAUSE WE IT

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:43.087
INCREASINGLY OR ROLE OF RELYING

00:33:43.154 --> 00:33:46.224
MORE AND MORE ON IN HOME A LIKE

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:47.325
ONE ELECTRICITY ELECTRIC

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:49.627
SUPPLY. OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:50.695
SYSTEM IS RELIANCE ON THE

00:33:50.762 --> 00:33:52.063
ELECTRIC SUPPLY AND NOW WE'RE

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.731
ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:54.699
CARBONIZED IN THE

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:56.000
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IN MAKING

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:59.404
NOT RELIABLE NO ELECTRIC SUPPLY

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.305
AS WELL AND HELP WITH THAT

00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:04.208
CALMS. THE RISK THAT IT POSES

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:06.210
TO PUBLIC SAFETY IF WE LOSE

00:34:06.277 --> 00:34:08.012
ELECTRIC POWER SO I THINK EL

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:09.881
TALKING ABOUT HOW TO REGARD

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:12.884
COMMUNITIES RESILIENCE TO LOSS

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.552
OF POWER IS IT IS VERY

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:16.487
IMPORTANT IN THAT THEY THINK

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:18.156
IT'S BENEFICIAL WHEN WE TALK

00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:20.358
ABOUT IT TO THE TO. KEEP IN

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:22.693
MIND THAT PSP ELSE IS NOT THE

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.229
ONLY REASON AND THAT WE NEED TO

00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:26.864
MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES RESILIENCE

00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:29.500
EVEN IF P. S. P. S. ALL

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:30.935
PROGRAMS WERE TO SOMEHOW WILL

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:32.437
COME WHEN NECESSARY AND GO AWAY

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:34.138
THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SOLD THAT

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:35.406
FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE THAT WE

00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:37.875
HAVE. ELEMENT IN THAT AS WITH

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:40.478
DESIGN SOLUTIONS L. AS TO THAT

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:43.448
ISSUE A THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:45.616
LOOK AT IT MORE BROADLY AND

00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:47.485
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. HOLDING

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:50.121
IT FOR THE ROOT PROBLEM OF

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:52.056
RESILIENCE OF OUR COMMUNITY IS

00:34:52.123 --> 00:35:03.868
ALL. AND NOT JUST MAKING P. S.

00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:13.110
P. S. ALL. TRANSMISSION IS LEFT

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:13.678
TO THE UTILITY TO MAKE THAT

00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:18.182
DECISION. AND WHEN YOU LOOK IN

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:19.784
THE EXCELLENT EXCELLENT

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:22.220
ANALYSIS AND STAFF REPORT THAT

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:23.154
WAS DONE FOR THIS COMMITTEE

00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:25.456
HERE AND REALLY GOES INTO THE

00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:26.524
DETAILS OF THE DISCRETION

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:28.125
REALLY AND THE DIFFERENT

00:35:28.192 --> 00:35:30.495
CRITERIA UTILIZED BY EACH

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:33.564
UTILITY IN MAKING THAT DECISION.

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:34.098
AND WE'LL GET INTO THAT OR

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:36.968
QUESTIONS LATER BUT- ARE YOU

00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:39.337
LOOKING AT STANDARDIZING THAT

00:35:39.403 --> 00:35:40.805
IN SOME FORM IF YOU MOVE TO THE

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:41.839
NEXT PHASE OF THE PS PS

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:44.876
PROTOCOLS SO THAT. THERE IS

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:46.277
LESS DISCRETION PERHAPS AND

00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:48.880
MORE DETERMINED PERHAPS USING

00:35:48.946 --> 00:35:51.549
MACHINE LEARNING TO DETERMINE.

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:53.818
OR ESTABLISH THOSE CRITERIA

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:55.119
THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN THEN

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.721
IT'S A LITTLE MORE RELIABLE

00:35:56.787 --> 00:35:57.455
LESS IN THE HANDS OF THE

00:35:57.522 --> 00:36:00.491
UTILITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION.

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:01.259
BUT MORE IN THE SCIENTIFIC

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:03.528
BASIS OF THAT RATHER THAN. AND

00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:04.028
I THINK IT IS MORE OF A

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:08.132
SCIENTIFIC. DECISION. L. IT AT

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:10.601
THIS POINT THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:11.969
PRINCIPLE REMAINS OF THOSE THE

00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:13.971
OPERATOR AT THE UTILITIES GET

00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:16.207
TO MAKE THE DECISION OF WHETHER

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:17.542
TO KEEP THEIR FACILITIES

00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:19.944
ENERGIZED OR NOT AND IT'S A. B.

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:22.713
L. QUITE SIGNIFICANT LINE TO

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.181
CROSS I MEAN THERE IS NO

00:36:24.248 --> 00:36:28.619
CURRENTLY. I WOULD SAY WE

00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:31.155
GENERALLY JUST DON'T KNOW. ONE

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:34.091
WE JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT

00:36:34.158 --> 00:36:37.595
THE BEHAVIOR ALL OF WILDFIRES

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:40.698
IN THE COULD CONDITIONS THAT.

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:43.534
RESULTS IN A CATASTROPHIC

00:36:43.601 --> 00:36:46.571
WILDFIRES REMOTE ELECTRIC LINES

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:48.606
THERE'S SOME HIGH LEVEL

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:53.244
THEORIES AROUND ITS- BLADES OF

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:55.613
THERE IS. EITHER LOW SPECIFIC

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.915
SET OF CONDITIONS THAT THE TO

00:36:57.982 --> 00:36:58.649
MY KNOWLEDGE HAVE BEEN STUDIED

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:00.384
AND VETTED THROUGH SOME KIND OF

00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:02.920
SCIENTIFIC METHODS THAT CAN SAY

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:04.055
THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS IF

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:04.522
YOU DO IT YOU KNOW ALL

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:06.524
WARRANTED TO ENERGIZE THE LINES

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:09.260
IN REALITY IT BECOMES. ALL A

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:10.828
QUESTION OF ALL OF ALL THE

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:14.599
LEVELS OF RISK AND WHAT KIND OF

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:17.768
FIRES OR WE TOLD HIM. YOU KNOW

00:37:17.835 --> 00:37:19.236
OR DO WE REALLY WANT TO

00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:22.440
PREVENTS ELM AND UP I DON'T

00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:24.141
THINK THAT THAT THIS POINTS SO

00:37:24.208 --> 00:37:25.776
WE HOW OF EITHER ENOUGH DATA OR

00:37:25.843 --> 00:37:28.546
KNOWLEDGE. IT TO BE ABLE TO

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:29.847
DRAW THAT LINE ACCURATELY SO

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:31.749
ELEMENT THEY THINK WHERE WE ARE

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:33.117
AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT AND

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:35.720
CLAIM IS CONTINUING TO LEARN

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:44.962
ALL FOR ALL MY- WEIGHT KIND OF

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:50.768
CONDITIONS SO. THE UTILITIES

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:53.771
DEEM TO BE RISKY HOME AND THEN

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:56.140
HALL OF DISCUSSIONS OF THEM

00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:58.509
AFTER THE FACT OLD. GREEN

00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:00.077
COLLECTIVELY OVER THE

00:38:00.144 --> 00:38:01.579
ASSESSMENTS ALL THE EXPERTS

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:03.748
WORKING IN THIS FIELD OF WITH

00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:06.517
THE WERE INDEED L. POSED A HIGH

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:08.019
RISK OF HAVING A FEEDBACK MAC

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:09.553
MECHANISM AND CONTINUING TO

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.222
COLLECT. MORE AND MORE DATA AND

00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:13.024
GETTING MORE ADVANCED IN TERMS

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.326
OF HOW WE ASSESS RISKS SO WHILE

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:18.396
IT MAY BE. IF THEY'RE RADICALLY

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:19.664
POSSIBLE TO HALL OF MORE

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.566
STRICT. GUIDELINES WERE EVEN

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:25.536
RULES AROUND IT AT THIS

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:26.170
PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME I

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:27.038
DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE QUITE THERE

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:28.472
YET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL

FIRST SAYS AND THANK YOU FOR

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:43.721
MENTIONING THAT SDG IN THE

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:44.855
WHICH ALL KNOWLEDGE IS A

00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:45.923
SMALLER UTILITY AND SO IT'S

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.725
LESS INFRASTRUCTURE IS ABLE TO

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:49.994
DO MORE SURGICAL. OUR POWER

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:53.431
SHUT DOWNS AND AGAIN I KNOW P.

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:55.633
GINNY I MESSAGES DIFFERENT

00:38:55.700 --> 00:39:05.943
TOADIES DIFFERENT SERVICE AREAS.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:06.544
I'M NOT GOING TO PRETEND THAT

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:07.078
THEY ARE SOMEHOW IDENTICAL

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:14.552
THEY'RE NOT. THIS TERRITORY

00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:16.721
WE'RE GOING TO SEE OF VERY

00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:19.056
OVERBROAD OF POWER SHUT OFF

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:20.091
THAT ARE GOING TO AFFECT A HUGE

00:39:20.157 --> 00:39:22.660
SWATH OF OUR REGION. EVEN

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:26.163
THOUGH IT'S A VERY LOCALIZED

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.266
VIRUS. AND SO THE QUESTION IS

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:33.404
WHY IS IT. THAT P. GINNY IS NOT

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:35.740
ABLE TO DO THESE MORE SURGICAL

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:37.742
SHUT OFF AND WHAT IS THE CPUC

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:41.112
DOING TO ENSURE THAT. HE JENNY

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:43.748
MOVES TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE IT

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:45.116
CAN DO THE SURGICAL SHOT OFFICE.

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:48.953
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:51.455
THE GENIE AND THE P. JEANNIE OF

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:53.991
THIS VERY AS REASONS FOR THE

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:55.659
HOME AND SOME OF THEM ARE THE

00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:57.728
TO DO WITH JUST THE HISTORY OF

00:39:57.795 --> 00:39:59.263
THE SYSTEMS THE P. JEANNIE

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.432
SYSTEM AS A WHOLE WAS ONE LARGE

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:03.934
LARGER BUT ALSO MUCH OLDER SO

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:07.037
THOUGH IS THE GENIE TERRITORIAL

00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:09.106
SMALLER IT'S NEWER OF WHEN THE

00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:10.174
WE'RE DOING THE CONSTRUCTION OF

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:10.975
WITH A LOT OF THOSE ON THE

00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:13.010
GROND HOME SO THEY WERE

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:14.678
ALREADY DEALING WITH MUCH

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.213
SMALLER FOOTPRINTS AND BECAUSE

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.415
THE AS THE SYSTEM WAS BEING PUT

00:40:18.482 --> 00:40:21.118
INTO PLACE THEY WERE ABLE TO.

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:24.321
DESIGN ADS WITH MORE ADVANCED

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:27.091
KNOWLEDGE WORKERS P. JEANNIE

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:29.894
ELM IS IT THE VAULT DIFFERENTLY

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.263
OVER TIME SO SOME OF IT ISN'T

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:34.698
NECESSARILY THAT IS D. GENIE IS

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:36.634
NOT MUCH BETTER WELL THE P.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.868
JEANNIE BECAUSE OF ADVANCE

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:39.770
PLANNING AND SOME OF IT YOU

00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:41.338
KNOW THE THEY DID SEVERAL YEARS

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:43.474
AGO START ALL LOOKING

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:46.010
SPECIFICALLY AT MINIMIZING

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.845
IMPACTS OF THEIR BUT OF LINES

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:49.380
OF THE COULD POTENTIALLY DE

00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:50.314
ENERGIZED WITH A LOT OF IT DOES

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:53.184
ALSO ALL THEIR BENEFITING FROM

00:40:53.250 --> 00:41:00.524
THE SYSTEM DESIGN. THAT HAD

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:01.091
NOTHING TO DO WHAT WELL FIRE

00:41:01.158 --> 00:41:05.429
PREVENTION ELM. IN THE FIRST

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:06.530
PLACE IN TERMS OF WEIGHT YOU

00:41:06.597 --> 00:41:07.932
KNOW. CURRENTLY WE HAVE THE

00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:10.000
SYSTEMS THAT WE HOW OFF. OF ME

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:13.070
AND- THE PART OF P. GENIES

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:14.038
WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN IN THIS

00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:15.506
THIS THING CAN TALK MORE TO IT

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:16.740
DOES INCLUDE ADDING MORE

00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:18.242
SECTIONAL LASERS AND OTHERWISE

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:19.009
RECONFIGURING THE SYSTEM SO

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:20.511
THAT THEY CAN GET ELM. A LITTLE

00:41:20.578 --> 00:41:21.946
BIT BETTER AT MINIMIZING THE

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:24.381
IMPACT WHEN THEY DE ENERGIZED

00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:27.051
ELM LINES THAT ARE IN THE HIGH

00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:30.020
FILE THREAT ZONES. AND THEN.

00:41:30.087 --> 00:41:31.088
AND I'M SUREYOU DIDN'T MISS A

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:32.656
SINGLE ADDRESS DIED IN THE

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:33.891
TIMING ON THAT BUT IN THE OTHER

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:35.392
QUESTION IS TO JUST TO BE

00:41:35.459 --> 00:41:37.928
CLEAR. SO WHEN I WHEN I

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:40.364
ELECTRIC UTILITY DECIDES TO

00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:43.100
POWER DOWN. ON THAT CAN AVOID

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:45.536
LIABILITY FOR THE UTILITY WHAT

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:49.006
ARE THE FINANCIAL. CONSEQUENCES

00:41:49.073 --> 00:41:50.407
FOR UTILITY FOR ENGAGING IN A

00:41:50.474 --> 00:41:52.910
SHUT DOWN AND ARE THERE ANY

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:59.750
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES NOT. TO GO

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:02.219
NOT TO ARE ON THE SIDE OF BEING.

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:06.357
BROAD. WHAT ARE THERE ARE I

00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:08.125
MEAN OF COURSE YOU'RE I MEAN

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:08.893
PEOPLE ARE NOT PURCHASING

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:10.160
ELECTRICITY TO RATE THEIR

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:11.228
LOSING THAT REPAIR MONEY BUT

00:42:11.295 --> 00:42:12.863
THAT'S SMALL IN THE IN THE BIG

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:13.397
SCHEME OF THINGS ARE THEIR

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:15.499
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR THEM

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:16.033
NOT TO ENGAGE IN AN OVERLY

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.435
BROAD. SHUT DOWN. BECAUSE IT

00:42:18.502 --> 00:42:19.003
SEEMS LIKE IT'S A ONE SIDED

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:23.240
INCENTIVE FINANCIALLY. OF YEAH

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:24.074
A THING PROBABLY MISS THE

00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:26.310
SINGLES BUT IT THE POSITION TO

VULNERABLE TO THIS AS WELL. TO

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:34.631
ALL OF THESE IMPACTS HAVE LED

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.209
MUCH MORE TARGETED IN REGARDS

00:57:59.275 --> 00:58:01.110
TO OUR GREAT. AS MISMO SHEKEL

00:58:01.177 --> 00:58:02.712
MENTIONED ARE GREAT IS

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:05.348
OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:08.685
IN TERMS OF SIZE AND SCALE. WE

00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:10.053
HAVE NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:11.654
MILES OF OVERHEAD LINES THAT

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:13.256
TRAVERSE THE HIGH FAR THREAT

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:13.957
DISTRICTS OF PUT THAT IN

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:16.492
CONTEXT IT'S- MORE THAN THE

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:18.161
DISTANCE AROUND THE WORLD AND

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:19.095
THAT'S REALLY THE SCALE THAT WE

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:21.264
ARE MANAGING. WE ARE CURRENTLY

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:22.165
INSTALLING SOCIALIZATION

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:23.633
DEVICES WITH IT STALLED MORE

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:24.767
THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THIS

00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:26.369
YEAR ALONE AND WE'RE CONTINUING

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:28.004
TO PROACTIVELY INSTALL THOSE

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:29.906
DEVICES AND WHAT THOSE DEVICES

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:31.674
DO IS THEY BASICALLY REDUCE.

00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:34.644
THE ABILITY FOR US AN INCREASE

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:36.079
THE ABILITY AND REDUCE THE

00:58:36.145 --> 00:58:38.915
IMPACT. ON THE CIRCUIT ITSELF

00:58:38.982 --> 00:58:40.617
SO THEREBY MINIMIZING AND

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:44.320
REDUCING. THE NUMBER OF

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:44.921
CUSTOMERS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:50.159
IMPACTED. OF IN THAT THE IDEA

00:58:50.226 --> 00:58:51.494
GENERATION EVENT. IN ADDITION

00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:52.061
TO THAT WE ARE INSTALLING A

00:58:52.128 --> 00:58:53.229
SIGNIFICANT NETWORK OF WEATHER

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:54.664
STATIONS WE HAVE. MORE THAN

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:55.265
FOUR HUNDRED WEATHER STATIONS

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.000
INSTALLED WITHIN OUR SYSTEM.

00:58:57.066 --> 00:58:58.534
AND THAT GIVES US THE ABILITY

00:58:58.601 --> 00:58:59.602

UNDERSTAND THE MICRO CLIMATE.

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:02.739
AND WITH THAT COUPLED WITH THE

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:05.074
SOCIALIZATION DEVICES BE MUCH

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:07.243
MORE TARGETED AND PRECISE. NOT

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:08.478
IN NARROWING IN ON OUR

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:19.034
CONSEQUENCES OF AN EXTENDED P.

01:07:19.101 --> 01:07:20.669
S. P. S. ADVANTAGE AND LOCAL

01:07:20.736 --> 01:07:22.705
COMMUNITIES I YOUR DAILY GOING

HERE FOR MANY EXPERTS AFTER ME.

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:26.675
BUT I'LL JUST SHARE WITH YOU

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:28.677
WITH REGARD TO ONE PARTICULAR

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:30.379
PHENOMENON THAT IS NINE ONE ONE

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:35.084
CALLS. THE BEST CASE SCENARIO.

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:40.055
WE BELIEVE IS THAT AFTER A.

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:42.158
SAFETY SHUT DOWN THERE WOULD BE

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:42.758
A SURGE OF NINE ONE ONE CALLS

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:44.026
THAT WILL OVER WELL. OUR FIRST

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:46.162
RESPONDERS COMING FROM

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:47.430
RESIDENTS WITH RESPIRATORS

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:48.397
COMING FROM RESIDENTS WITH

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:49.698
MEDICINE MEDICATION IT NEEDS

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:52.468
REFRIGERATION COMING FROM FOLKS

01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:55.271
WHO MAY BE CALLING BECAUSE

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:55.905
POLICE ARE DEALING WITH

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:58.674
MULTIPLE TRAFFIC COLLISIONS IN

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.676
AND PERHAPS FASTENED IN

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.678
DARKENED ARE AREAS OF THE CITY

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:04.680
THE WORST SCENARIO OF COURSE IS

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:05.981
THAT THERE'S NINE ONE ONE CALLS

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:08.551
WE MADE INTO. OVERLOADED

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:11.353
NETWORKS ALTERNATELY LOST. AND

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.288
EVEN WORSE STILL THAT WITH AN

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:14.190
EXTENDED DURATION THE P. S. P.

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:17.059
S. OF SIX TWELVE OR MORE HOURS.

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:18.327
THAT CELL TOWERS WILL

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:23.098
ESSENTIALLY SHUT DOWN. SO IN

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:23.732
VIEW OF THESE RISK MY AVERAGE

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:25.167
HE REALLY FOLKS ISN'T THREE

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:27.236
BASIC AREAS ONE IS THE LACK OF

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:28.904
ACTIVE PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER INPUT

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:31.006
AND PS YES DECISION. AS

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.074
SECONDLY ON THE NEED FOR

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:33.776
IMPROVED COMMUNICATION WITH

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:35.845
TACTIC COMMUNITIES AND THIRD ON

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:38.080
RESOURCES FOR RESILIENCY. OF

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.882
FIRST THE ISSUE OF WHO DECIDES

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.116
I DON'T WANT TO OVERLOOK THE

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:42.551
OBVIOUS THAT HAS BEEN OBVIOUSLY

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:43.619
THERE'S BEEN CLEARLY STATED

01:08:43.686 --> 01:08:45.321
THAT THE CURRENT RULES LEAD

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:46.288
THESE LIFE OR DEATH DECISIONS

01:08:46.355 --> 01:08:48.057
OVER DE ENERGIES ATION. IN THE

01:08:48.123 --> 01:08:51.393
HANDS OF INVESTOR OWNED

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.027
UTILITIES AND NOT A PUBLICATION

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:55.831
SEE. UTILITIES HAVE ASYMMETRIC

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:56.732
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AS WITH

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.067
POINT OUT BY SENATOR WIENER. I

01:08:58.134 --> 01:08:58.968
SHUT DOWN TRANSMISSION LINES

01:08:59.034 --> 01:09:00.569
MITIGATE LIABILITY EVEN WERE

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.605
DOING SO WILL SUBJECT.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:03.205
RESIDENTS IN CITIES LIKE MINE

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:06.442
TO PARA. AND I APPRECIATE THAT

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:09.211
NEITHER YASSER ISO OR PROBABLY

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:10.045
ANY OTHER PUBLICATIONS HE WANTS

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:12.248
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:12.748
VERY CONSEQUENTIAL PS PS

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:15.351
DECISION BUT THESE ARE

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.052
DECISIONS THAT ALLOCATE RISKS

01:09:17.119 --> 01:09:19.889
AMONG AND WITHIN COMMUNITIES.

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:21.657
AND THE DECISION TO NORTHERN

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:22.625
CALIFORNIA BEEN DELEGATED BY

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:24.994
DEFAULT I TO COMPANY THAT'S

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:25.728
BEEN CRIMINALLY CONVICTED FOR

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:27.763
SAFETY VIOLATIONS THAT

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.565
FALSIFIED ELECTRIC AND GAS

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:31.000
INFRASTRUCTURE RECORDS FOR HALF

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:32.368
A DECADE AND PAID SEVEN BILLION

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:34.003
DOLLARS. AND SHAREHOLDER

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:36.138
DIVIDENDS IN A DECADE WHICH

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:38.440
THEY SLASH INVESTMENT ON KEY

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:38.974
INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY AND

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:42.011
MAINTENANCE. I WE UNDERSTAND

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:42.945
THE DECISION WILL BE MADE BY AN

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:44.346
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT P.

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:46.549
JEANNIE ABOUT THE SHUTDOWN WE

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:48.784
HAD NO IDEA THAT PERSON'S AN

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.386
ENGINEER HAS ANY EXPERTISE. AND

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:52.922
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IN ANY

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:55.157
CASE I WOULD URGE THAT THE

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.292
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER HOW TO

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.026
REALLOCATE DECISION MAKING

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:57.560
AUTHORITY FROM PRIVATE TO

01:09:57.626 --> 01:10:00.930
PUBLIC. NOT MERELY AN OVERSIGHT

01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:02.431
REVIEW BUT IN THE ACTIVE

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:03.365
INVOLVEMENT IN THE PS YES

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:05.701
DECISION. IF THERE'S A

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:07.202
RELUCTANCE TO DO SO AT THE

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:07.736
FRONT END AND THE TIERS IS

01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:11.440
ATION. I WOULD ASK AT LEAST TO

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:14.443
CONSIDER A GREATER PUBLIC ROLE

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.546
IN THE BACK AND TO RE ENERGIZE.

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:18.247
THE GRID AFTER IT'S BEEN SHUT

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:20.482
DOWN THE TRANSMISSION LINE. IT

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:21.517
SEEMS THAT THE MOST

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:23.085
CONSEQUENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:25.287
ENERGY IS ATION COME NOT FROM

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:25.921
THE DECISION TO FLIP THE SWITCH

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:28.857
OFF BUT RATHER. THE DELAY

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:30.459
DURATION ON WHICH IS SWITCHED

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:33.529
OFF AND AT THE VERY MINIMUM. WE

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:34.697
ASK THAT EVERY UTILITY'S LOCAL

01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:36.231
MERCY OPERATIONS CENTER WOULD

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:38.400
ALSO INCLUDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:39.001
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT STAFF TO

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.936
INFORM. ABOUT THIS SITUATION ON

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:46.075
THE GROUND UP. BUT WE KNOW A AS

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:46.742
WAS JUST MENTIONED THAT

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:48.410
INSPECTIONS REPAIRS ARE THE

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:50.212
CRITICAL PATH TO RE ENERGIZING

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:50.846
A TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:54.350
LINE. RIGHT NOW THE PC IS NOT

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:55.918
ESTABLISHED ANY FROM TIMELINE

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:56.485
TO REQUIRE UTILITIES TO ACT

01:10:56.552 --> 01:11:00.623
QUICKLY. TAKING FIVE TO SEVEN

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:01.190
DAYS TO INSPECT WINDS IS NOT

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:04.460
ACCEPTABLE AND THEY SHOULD GET

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:05.060
HELICOPTERS AND DRONES IN THE

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:07.229
AIR WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS.

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:08.430
WHERE SUFFICIENT REDUNDANCY

01:11:08.497 --> 01:11:10.065
EXISTS IN THE SYSTEM

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:11.367
PUBLICATIONS HE SHOULD BE ABLE

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:12.935
TO DIRECT THE MAJORITY OF POWER

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:14.603
TO BE RESTORED WHILE REPAIRS

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.005
ARE ISOLATED ON SPECIFIC WINDS.

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:20.643
THAT MY REMAINED DARK. A SECOND

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:23.479
A COMMUNICATION. WE WOULD ASK.

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:25.848
THAT THERE BE SOME LEGISLATIVE

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:19.928
AREA AND. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:21.029

THAT WE HAVE MUCH. AND FAR

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:43.265
BETTER CAPABILITIES GOING INTO

WITH THE CITY OF SAN JOSE ON

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.820
MULTIPLE OCCASIONS IN REGARDS

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:08.723
TO OUR PROTOCOLS. HOW WE WOULD

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.058
GO ABOUT THE NOTIFICATION

ENTITIES WITHIN YOUR RESPECTIVE

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:19.734
DISTRICTS TO SIGN NONDISCLOSURE

SO THOSE ARE ALL OF THE THINGS

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:36.384
THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING AS

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:38.420
AS PART OF THIS PROCESS SORRY

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:39.621
IF I MISSED A ANY ANY OTHER

01:22:39.688 --> 01:22:41.256
QUESTION THAT YOU HAD IN THERE.

01:22:41.323 --> 01:22:42.957
JUST LIKE SPECIFICALLY CITY BIG

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:44.559
CITY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:47.996
OAKLAND SAN JOSE HOW DO WE RE

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:52.500
DIRECT POWER SO THAT MAJOR THAT

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:53.201
I JUST THINK THAT JUST

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:55.970
MAGNIFIES PROBLEMS IN IN IN OUR

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:57.539
ANTICIPATION IS THAT THE

01:22:57.605 --> 01:23:00.875
LIKELIHOOD OF A POTENTIAL PS PS

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:02.510
WOULD IMPACT MORE OF THE

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:03.878
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:05.547
HIGH FAR THREAT DISTRICTS THAT

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:07.349
ARE IN THAT URBAN WILDLAND

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:09.150
INTERFACE. ME OBVIOUSLY WE'LL

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:10.185
PUT THAT IN ONE OF THE REASONS

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:11.686
WHY WE GOT OUT AND COMMUNICATE

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:12.821
TO THE FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:14.889
IS THE INTER CONNECTED NATURE

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:15.924
OF OUR GREAT WITH TRANSMISSION

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:18.126
AND DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFICULT

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:19.594
TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON HISTORY

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.896
ACROSS THE BOARD RIGHT IN TERMS

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:22.630
OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THE

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:24.699
WEATHER AND CLIMATOLOGY AND OUR

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:26.034
CONCERN HERE IS IF WE DO SEE A

01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:29.003
EXTREME TOP OF A WEATHER EVENT

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:29.471
THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:31.072
PREVIOUSLY. AND THERE IS A

01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:32.941
POTENTIAL IMPACT A TRANSMISSION

01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:33.775
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.277
WORKINGVERY VERY CLOSELY WITH

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:37.178
THE SERENA AND THE CAL I SO

01:23:37.245 --> 01:23:39.080
TEAM BECAUSE THEY'RE ULTIMATELY

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:40.348
RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THAT

01:23:40.415 --> 01:23:41.950
GRADE BUT IN THE INSTANCE WHERE

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:43.284
THERE'S A POTENTIAL IMPACT OF

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:48.823
THE TRANSMISSION. LINE IS THE

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:54.696
REASON WHY WE WANT OUT A. MADE

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:55.296
THOSE COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:56.297
FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS WE

01:23:56.364 --> 01:23:56.865
ANTICIPATE THE LIKELY WHO'S

01:23:56.931 --> 01:23:57.899
GOING TO BE LOWER ESPECIALLY

01:23:57.966 --> 01:23:58.533
WITH IN THOSE CITIES AND CONDOS

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.968
DENSE URBAN AREAS. AND WHERE WE

01:24:00.034 --> 01:24:01.102
HAVE OUR DISTRIBUTION CIRCUITS

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:01.703

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:09.611
WE CAN ACTUALLY FIND WAYS TO BE

01:24:09.677 --> 01:24:11.913
ABLE TO ISOLATE THOSE CIRCUITS.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.514
THAT ARE TRAVERSING THE HIGH

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:15.016
FAR RISK AREA AND PERCENT

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:18.153
POWER. AROUND TO AN AREA OF A

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.320
LOWER RISK THAT COULD STILL

PUBLIC THAT'S LEADER PROVED

01:36:06.861 --> 01:36:09.230
TO BE INCORRECT THAT SENSE TO

WITH UTILITIES IN DIFFERENT

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:19.807
CAPACITIES I KNOW THE HEALTH

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:21.509
MUCH MORE ACCURATE RESTORATION

JUST THE INNOCENT JUST TO USE

01:36:38.092 --> 01:36:39.660
THE EXAMPLE OF RESTORATION

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:40.895
FROM MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE

01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:43.430
UTILITY TYPICALLY DOES IS THE

01:36:43.497 --> 01:36:44.532
YOU KNOW YOU HOW THE WEATHER

LINES OUT TO GET THIS STARTED

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:48.802
GOING OUT INSPECTING IN THOSE

01:36:48.869 --> 01:36:50.004
THAT COLLECTING MORE AND MORE

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:51.539
INFORMATION THEY CONSISTENTLY

01:36:51.605 --> 01:36:53.707
UPDATING THEIR INTERNAL PLANS

01:36:53.774 --> 01:36:55.743
AS TO WHEN THE THINGS THEY CAN

01:36:55.809 --> 01:36:57.912
GET CUSTOMER OF ON AND IN WHAT

01:36:57.978 --> 01:37:00.014
ORDER BUT THOSE PLANS CHANGED

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.448
IT IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE A

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:03.050
THING FROM AN OPERATOR'S POINTS

01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:05.553
OF VIEW IS IF YOU SPEAK THROUGH

01:37:05.619 --> 01:37:07.388
EARLY AND THAT INFORMATION

01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:09.490
LEADER PROVED TO BE INCORRECT

01:37:09.557 --> 01:37:11.559
ELEMENT THEY NEED YOU KNOW YOU

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:12.993
HAVE A CHALLENGE OF EXPLAINING

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.395
WHY YOU KNOW YOU PUT THAT

01:37:14.461 --> 01:37:15.996
INFORMATION OUT THERE AND THE

01:37:16.063 --> 01:37:17.431
CONFUSION OF THE POTENTIALLY

01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:19.867
CREATED SO A THINK WE ARE THE

01:37:19.934 --> 01:37:22.002
UTILITIES TYPICALLY ARE IS ON

01:37:22.069 --> 01:37:23.704
THE MORE CONSERVATIVE SIDE OF

01:37:23.771 --> 01:37:25.206
THAT SPECTRUM WITH THE ONE TO

01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:27.708
BE SURE BEFORE THE SPEAK BY A

01:37:27.775 --> 01:37:30.477
THINK ILL YOU KNOW IT CREATES

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:33.581
ALL ALONG -- OF EFFORTS THAN

01:37:33.647 --> 01:37:35.749
FOR OTHER AND CITIES LAY COOL

01:37:35.816 --> 01:37:38.586
WE ASK AND THE PC TO EXTRACT

01:37:38.652 --> 01:37:40.221
THAT INFORMATION OUT OF THE

OUT INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND

01:37:43.857 --> 01:37:45.259
I THINK IF MORE INFORMATION

01:37:45.326 --> 01:37:48.662
COULD BE SHARED OLD ACTIVELY

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:50.998

SO THAT THAT I THINK IS ONE

01:38:06.146 --> 01:38:07.214
CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE HAVING

01:38:07.281 --> 01:38:08.182

01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:46.520
WILDFIRE THREAT CONDITIONS

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:47.888
IN STATE THE ROOM PARTICULAR

01:38:47.955 --> 01:38:49.690
REGION SO YOU THINK YOU THE

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:52.126
DOTS IN THE AREA WE ARE ALL

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:54.261
WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE UTILITIES

01:38:54.328 --> 01:38:56.597
IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE

01:38:56.664 --> 01:38:58.832
NOW AND REALLY FOLLOW THE

01:38:58.899 --> 01:39:00.000
GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:01.335
PROVIDED FOR THE STATE'S AND

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:02.603
MAKE SURE THAT THEIR MESSAGING

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:06.040
IS COORDINATED ELLIS THROUGH

01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:09.109
THE ENTIRE EMERGENCY RESPONSE

01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:10.944
SYSTEM THE OTHER PART I WOULD

01:39:11.011 --> 01:39:12.546
SAY IS A COLLABORATION ACROSS

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:14.615
IS THREE ARE YOU USE THAT'S

01:39:14.682 --> 01:39:17.151
ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE A THINK

01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:19.119
OF BETWEEN -- WE US IN THE

01:39:19.186 --> 01:39:20.621
PEACE YOU'VE PROBABLY SPEND

01:39:20.688 --> 01:39:22.923
THE MOST TIME ON IS JUST TRYING

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.491
TO GET ME THROUGH UTILITIES

01:39:24.558 --> 01:39:26.060
TO WORK TOGETHER AND SPEAK THE

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:29.029
SAME LANGUAGE AND IS BEING EL

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:31.398
RESISTANCE FROM FROM HOME TO

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:33.634
DO THAT ON THEIR OWN SO UNLESS

01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:34.568
WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING THEM

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:36.303
WHEN THE MEETING AND AND AND

01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:39.306
DRIVING TO A STANDARD PROCEDURE

01:39:39.373 --> 01:39:40.941
ON SOMETHING AND THEN HOVERING

01:39:41.008 --> 01:39:41.975
OVER THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.644
ACTUALLY FOLLOWING IT YOU

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:45.045
KNOW LOVE TO THEIR OWN DEVICES

01:39:45.112 --> 01:39:46.780
THE GO ON INTO THEIR OWN SILO

01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:48.215
THEY'RE NOT GEOGRAPHICALLY

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:49.383
THAT YOU NEED TO HELP SEPARATE

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:51.185
GEOGRAPHIES AND FOOT PRINTS

01:39:51.251 --> 01:39:52.419
AND SO IT'S VERY EASY FOR THEM

01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:54.021
TO JUST GO INTO THEIR DOMAIN

01:39:54.088 --> 01:39:55.155
AND NOT THINK ABOUT THERE'S

01:39:55.222 --> 01:39:57.424
THIS SISTER UTILITIES BEFORE US

01:39:57.491 --> 01:39:58.859
WERE MANAGING IT AT THE STATE

01:39:58.926 --> 01:40:01.128
LEVEL SO THESE DIFFERENCES

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:02.996
THAT THEY MAY WORK FOR THEM

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:04.865
OPERATIONALLY LOCALLY AND

01:40:04.932 --> 01:40:06.400
BROKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR SEEN YEAR

01:40:06.467 --> 01:40:08.135
AGO YOU KNOW THEY'VE HAD THIS

01:40:08.202 --> 01:40:10.170
PROGRAM FOR QUITE A LONG TIME

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:11.572
NO A LOT OF BEST PRACTICES THEY

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:13.774
DON'T NECESSARILY WORK FOR THE

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.042
OTHER TWO UTILITIES G.

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:17.878
TO THE SCALE AND SO YOU KNOW

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:19.380
WE HAVE KIND OF CHALLENGES

01:40:19.446 --> 01:40:20.714
LAKE EITHER IS D.

01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:22.349
G. NEED NOT WANTING TO CHANGE

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:23.550
WHAT ALREADY WORKS FOR THEM

01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:24.585
AND IT'S BEEN PROVEN IN THE

01:40:24.651 --> 01:40:27.421
SCENE DIEGO COMMUNITY ALL BUT

01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:29.390
YOU KNOW WE IF WE HEALTH THREE

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:30.858
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN YOU KNOW

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:32.292
THESE ARE NOT ONLY UTILITIES

01:40:32.359 --> 01:40:33.260
WILL HELP IN THE STATE OF

01:40:33.327 --> 01:40:34.428
WOULD KIND OF START CARVING

01:40:34.495 --> 01:40:35.729
IN NOW THE EVERYBODY DOES IT

01:40:35.796 --> 01:40:37.798
DIFFERENTLY IT DISINTEGRATES

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:39.433
AND BECOMES VERY VERY DIFFERENT

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:40.901
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE ACROSS

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:42.169
THE STATE LINE SLEEPING PRO

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.804
ACTIVE COLLABORATION ACROSS

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:45.739
OF THREE I WE USE AND ALSO

01:40:45.806 --> 01:40:47.374
FRANKLY WITH OTHER UTILITIES

01:40:47.441 --> 01:40:49.309
AND IN THE STATE SO THAT WE

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:50.644
A STATE AGENCIES WILL HAVE

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:51.945
TO CONSTANTLY BE DRAGGING

01:40:52.012 --> 01:40:53.680
THE MAN TO HAVE A CONSISTENT

01:40:53.747 --> 01:40:54.815
APPROACH TO THIS WOULD BE

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:59.720
EXTREMELY ALL EXTREMELY HOPEFUL

01:40:59.787 --> 01:41:01.755
THANK YOU THANK YOU RIVERS

01:41:01.822 --> 01:41:04.158
CENTERS DON'T THANK YOU --

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:05.459
AND AND AGAINST HER THANK YOU

01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:08.128
FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AND

01:41:08.195 --> 01:41:10.998
LET ME SAY THAT -- I I REALLY

01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:12.800
-- APPLIED MY MY COLLEAGUES

01:41:12.866 --> 01:41:15.202
SENATOR MCGUIRE AND DODD FOR AN

01:41:15.269 --> 01:41:17.438
DURING A LOT OF MORBIDITY AND

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:18.772
MORTALITY IN THEIR DISTRICTS

01:41:18.839 --> 01:41:20.073
IT VERY WELL COULD HAVE BEEN

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:21.875
IN MY DISTRICT I HAD THE

01:41:21.942 --> 01:41:23.110
CRANSTON FIRE AND THE HOLY

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:25.479
FIRE -- THE CRANSTON FIRE WAS

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:27.080
IN THE IDYLLWILD AREA THAT AS

01:41:27.147 --> 01:41:29.016
IN -- VERY LIMITED INGRESS AND

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:30.984
EGRESS HAD THAT FIRE STARTED

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:32.085
AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:33.020
INSTEAD OF THE BOTTOM OF THE

01:41:33.086 --> 01:41:34.855
MOUNTAIN WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:36.490
NOT NECESSARILY -- HUNDRED OR

01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:37.558
TWO HUNDRED GUESTS WE TALKING

01:41:37.624 --> 01:41:38.792
ABOUT MAYBE A COUPLE THOUSAND

01:41:38.859 --> 01:41:41.061
US SO THIS THIS CONVERSATION OR

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:43.297
HAVING TODAY IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:41:43.363 --> 01:41:44.031
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST

01:41:44.097 --> 01:41:45.098
IMPORTANT POINTS THAT I WANT

01:41:45.165 --> 01:41:47.234
TO MAKE TODAY IT'S A WE CAN NO

01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:49.169
LONGER AFFORD TO DISCOVER OUR

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:51.705
FAILURES WITH MORE FIRE OFFENSE

01:41:51.772 --> 01:41:54.141
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:57.211
OF NUMBER ONE -- A DEATH IN

01:41:57.277 --> 01:41:59.746
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS JUST AS

01:41:59.813 --> 01:42:01.348
IS A FAT AS A DEATH IN SOUTHERN

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:03.650
CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE TO DO

01:42:03.717 --> 01:42:05.052
WE CAN NOW TO LIMIT THE THE

01:42:05.118 --> 01:42:06.553
MORBIDITY MORTALITY ASSOCIATE

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:07.821
WITH WILDFIRES ARE BECOMING

01:42:07.888 --> 01:42:09.890
MUCH MORE COMMON -- IN THE

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:13.260
STATE OF OF CALIFORNIA SO WITH

01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:18.298

I WOULD CALL RISK QUANTIFIERS

OWNS IN OTHER WORDS AN AREA

01:42:26.139 --> 01:42:28.542
IN SAN FRANCISCO MAY NOT HAVE

01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:30.377
THE THE VULNERABILITY OF A

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:32.913
WILDFIRE THAN SAY IDYLLWILD

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:34.348
OF MY DISTRICT OR IN SOME OF

01:42:34.414 --> 01:42:35.582
THE MORE RURAL AREAS OF SEND

HELP INFORM OUR RISK REDUCTION

01:42:51.131 --> 01:42:53.634
MEASURES SO THINGS AROUND THE

THE UNFORTUNATE ISSUE OF THE

01:45:36.697 --> 01:45:38.398
EIGHT HOURS BEFORE LAKE COUNTY

01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:39.866
IDENTIFYING THAT INDIA NEEDS

01:45:39.933 --> 01:45:41.802
TO BE PUT IN PLACE THOSE ARE

01:45:41.868 --> 01:45:43.470
THE CUSTOMER PRIVACY LAWS THAT

01:45:43.537 --> 01:45:44.738
WE UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW EXISTS

01:45:44.805 --> 01:45:45.739
WITHIN THE STATE THAT'S ONE

01:45:45.806 --> 01:45:46.707
AREA WHERE WE COULD USE SOME

01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:50.043
HELP BUT WE HAVE NOW NBA'S PRO

01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:51.011
ACTIVELY THAT HAVE BEEN SET

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:52.212
UP I WOULD MORE THAN THIRTY

01:45:52.279 --> 01:45:53.714
COUNTIES AND WE'RE PROVIDING

01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:54.981
THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION TO A

01:45:55.048 --> 01:45:57.751
SECURE PORTAL WITH MAPS WITH

01:45:57.818 --> 01:45:59.052
THE AREAS WHERE WE ANTICIPATE

01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:00.353
A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF A

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:02.289
POTENTIAL PS PS EVENT FOR

01:46:02.355 --> 01:46:03.924
FACILITIES ARE SEVENTY CAVEAT

01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:06.126
ABOVE INCLUDING THE CRITICAL

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:07.661
ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:09.229
SPECIFICALLY THE MEDICAL BASED

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:11.298
ON CUSTOMERS YEAH AGAIN IT

01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:12.599
SEEMS LIKE WITH EVERY MAJOR

01:46:12.666 --> 01:46:14.167
FIRE WE WE LEARN ABOUT HOW

01:46:14.234 --> 01:46:15.702
UNPREPARED WE ARE FOR THESE

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:17.838
FIRES -- WHEN I WAS GROWING

01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:20.207
UP AND PROBABLY -- MANY OTHERS

01:46:20.273 --> 01:46:21.141
THAT ARE SITTING ON THE DAIS

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:22.509
ARE FROM CALIFORNIA WHEN I WAS

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:23.510
IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL WE USED TO

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:24.845
HAVE EARTHQUAKE DRILLS SO WE

01:46:24.911 --> 01:46:27.180
USED TO SOME ALARM USED TO GET

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:29.015
ANY THEIR DESKS AND COVER HEADS

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:31.318
AND STUFF -- HAS EVER BEEN ANY

01:46:31.384 --> 01:46:34.321
THOUGHT TO HAVING A AN EXERCISE

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:36.223
A A PRACTICE P. S.

01:46:36.289 --> 01:46:39.392
P. S. INCIDENT SO THAT INSTEAD

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:41.394
OF AN EMERGENCY SITUATION WHERE

01:46:41.461 --> 01:46:43.130
WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO FIGURE

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:45.565
THINGS OUT -- WE ACTUALLY DO

01:46:45.632 --> 01:46:46.767
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN IN THE

01:46:46.833 --> 01:46:49.269
COMMUNITY -- AS AS ROSS PEROT

01:46:49.336 --> 01:46:50.604
WON SAID THERE'S AT THE LAKE

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:51.738
ROSS PEROT SAID THERE'S NOTHING

01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:52.873
WRONG WITH STEALING A GOOD IDEA

01:46:52.939 --> 01:46:54.441
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE SOUNDS LIKE

01:46:54.508 --> 01:46:55.475
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THAT WITH

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:57.644
-- SDG ANY THAT DOES NOT WANT

01:46:57.711 --> 01:46:59.179
TO RELIVE SOME OF THE ISSUES

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:00.647
THAT THEY HAD TO AND OR OR --

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:03.683
A DECADE OR TWO AGO -- ERIC

01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:05.085
ALSO BRINGS TO THE POINT CENTER

01:47:05.152 --> 01:47:06.219
MCGUIRE SAID YOU KNOW REACH

01:47:06.286 --> 01:47:07.320
OUT TO THESE OTHER STATES AND

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:09.289
FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING --

01:47:09.356 --> 01:47:11.424
BUT WHEN I HEAR YOU SAY THAT

01:47:11.491 --> 01:47:12.526
IT'S GONNA TAKE YEARS TO PUT

01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:13.927
THESE CAMERAS IN PLACE WHEN

01:47:13.994 --> 01:47:14.961
YOU HAVE THE ELECTRICAL LINES

01:47:15.028 --> 01:47:17.030
TO PUT THOSE CAMERAS I MEAN

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:18.298
WHAT IS A COST YOU PER HOUR

01:47:18.365 --> 01:47:19.599
EVERY EVERY HOUR THAT YOU BE

01:47:19.666 --> 01:47:21.134
ENERGIZED AND YOU CAN'T GET

01:47:21.201 --> 01:47:22.469
THAT ENERGY BACK ONTO YOUR YOUR

01:47:22.536 --> 01:47:23.603
STOCKHOLDERS I'M SURE IT'S A

01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:24.604
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:26.606
PROBABLY PALE IN COMPARISON

01:47:26.673 --> 01:47:27.574
TO WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO PUT

01:47:27.641 --> 01:47:29.676
THESE REMOTE CAMERAS SAID THAT

01:47:29.743 --> 01:47:31.144
YOU'D BE COMBINED BEST BUY FOR

01:47:31.211 --> 01:47:33.079
FIVE BUCKS TEN BUCKS A CAMERA

01:47:33.146 --> 01:47:34.614
-- I WOULD BELIEVE A COMPANY

01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:36.950
WITH -- THIS PROFESSIONALS THAT

01:47:37.017 --> 01:47:39.219
YOU HAVE -- THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:40.220
THAT YOU HAVE YOU COVER WHAT

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:41.121
TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE OF

01:47:41.188 --> 01:47:43.423
CALIFORNIA -- I DON'T THINK

01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:45.091
THAT YOU CAN AFFORD ANOTHER

01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:47.427
MAJOR INCIDENT -- IN THE FUTURE

01:47:47.494 --> 01:47:49.696
WITHOUT COMPLETELY DECIMATING

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:51.464
YOUR COUNTRY WHICH COMPANY

01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:52.833
WHICH IS UNDER ASSAULT RIGHT

01:47:52.899 --> 01:47:55.068
NOW BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW --

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:59.539
PRIOR PRIOR PROBLEM SO -- HOW

01:47:59.606 --> 01:48:01.408
CAN WE EXPEDITE YOUR ABILITY

01:48:01.474 --> 01:48:03.610
TO EVALUATE YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:48:03.677 --> 01:48:05.512
POSTI AN URGES ASIAN TO GET

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:07.681
THAT ELECTRICITY BACK ON SAFELY

01:48:07.747 --> 01:48:08.748
SO YOU DON'T CREATE ANOTHER

01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:09.749
INCIDENT WITH THE EXISTING

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:11.184
TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS TODAY

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:12.552
WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE POWER RIGHT

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:15.655
AT YOUR DISPOSAL SO SO SO SO

WHICH IS TO ENSURE THERE'S NO

01:48:21.228 --> 01:48:22.495
-- WHILE FAR BECAUSE BY OUR

01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:23.864
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM THAT THAT'S

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:25.799
THE UNWAVERING FOCUS AND I

01:48:25.866 --> 01:48:27.534
CAN TELL YOU THAT -- WITHIN

01:48:27.601 --> 01:48:29.135
LESS THAN A SIX MONTH TIME

01:48:29.202 --> 01:48:31.204

MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN

01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:51.925
A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION ON

01:48:51.992 --> 01:48:53.560
THE AERIAL FLEET CAPABILITY

01:48:53.627 --> 01:48:55.462
WE HAVE THE CAPABILITIES

OF A RESTORATION STRATEGY AND

01:49:04.604 --> 01:49:05.705
IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH WOULD

01:49:05.772 --> 01:49:07.507
LOVE TO HEAR IDEAS ON WHAT

UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR AREA IS

01:49:35.435 --> 01:49:37.804
MUCH LARGER -- BUT I ALSO KNOW

01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:40.140
THAT WITH TECHNOLOGY -- WE NEED

01:49:40.206 --> 01:49:43.810
TO KNOW -- WHEN THE ATMOSPHERIC

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:45.946
ADVANCE -- DECADE THAT A.

01:49:46.012 --> 01:49:48.648
B. ENERGY STATION IF NECESSARY

01:49:48.715 --> 01:49:50.383
SO CAN YOU NEED TO DE ENERGIZED

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:52.052
AND THEN WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE

01:49:52.118 --> 01:49:53.687
THE CAPABILITIES OF EVALUATING

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:54.788
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE

01:49:54.854 --> 01:49:57.390
SURE THAT IT IS CONNECTED NON

01:49:57.457 --> 01:49:59.225
HAZARDOUS AND TO TURN ON THE

01:49:59.292 --> 01:50:00.760
ELECTRICITY AS FAST AS WE CAN

01:50:00.827 --> 01:50:02.262
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE VULNERABLE

01:50:02.329 --> 01:50:04.297
POPULATIONS THOSE ARE THE KINDS

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:06.599
OF THINGS THAT AND THEN ALSO --

01:50:06.666 --> 01:50:08.068
RISK QUANTIFICATION ZONES THAT

OWN IN COMPARISON TO OTHER

01:50:15.175 --> 01:50:16.343
SONGS ARE YOU READY TO FOCUS

01:50:16.409 --> 01:50:18.044
ON DURING THESE THESE HIGH FIRE

01:50:18.111 --> 01:50:20.580
VENTED OUR FIRE SEASON I THANK

WE WANT TO BE HERE AGAIN NEXT

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:27.420
YEAR FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED

01:50:27.487 --> 01:50:29.356
-- IN THE LATEST FIRE INCIDENT

01:50:29.422 --> 01:50:31.091
AND AND AND AND JUST LASTLY

01:50:31.157 --> 01:50:32.058
IF YOU'D ANSWER MY QUESTION

01:50:32.125 --> 01:50:34.160
ABOUT IS IT EXERCISE IS AT

01:50:34.227 --> 01:50:35.595
ALL IS THAT A GOOD IDEA OR A

01:50:35.662 --> 01:50:37.964
BAD IDEA TO DO THINGS WHEN WE

01:50:38.031 --> 01:50:39.366
DON'T HAVE LIVES IN JEOPARDY WE

01:50:39.432 --> 01:50:40.800
WE WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THAT

01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:41.768
RIGHT IT'S IT'S NO DIFFERENT

01:50:41.835 --> 01:50:43.370
THAN AN ATHLETE TRAINING

01:50:43.436 --> 01:50:45.238
RIGHT AND DOING PRACTICE AND

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:46.573
DRILLS TO BE ABLE TO GET READY

01:50:46.639 --> 01:50:47.841
FOR THE GAME WE LOOK AT THE

01:50:47.907 --> 01:50:49.142
SAME WAY INTERNALLY WE'RE

01:50:49.209 --> 01:50:50.243
DOING THESE EXERCISES WERE

01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:51.411
DOING THESE DRILLS WERE DOING

01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:53.046
PLANNING WORKSHOPS WITH SOME

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:54.614
OF THE FIRST RESPONSE AGENCIES

01:50:54.681 --> 01:50:56.149
INCLUDING SOME OF THE THAT THE

01:50:56.216 --> 01:50:57.917
LOCAL COUNTY OFFICIALS -- AND

01:50:57.984 --> 01:51:00.253
WHAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO ENGAGE

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.488
IN THAT DISCUSSION AND DIALOGUE

01:51:01.554 --> 01:51:02.856
I THINK SO IT IDEA AND WAIT ON

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:04.724
IT TOO DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A I

01:51:04.791 --> 01:51:06.426
MEAN WOULD BE GREAT TO TURN OFF

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:07.560
THE ELECTRICITY WHEN WE DON'T

01:51:07.627 --> 01:51:08.595
HAVE AN EMERGENCY TO FIGURE

01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:10.697
OUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE MISSING

01:51:10.764 --> 01:51:11.831
SO THAT WHEN WE REALLY HAVE THE

01:51:11.898 --> 01:51:14.200
REAL EVENT WE'RE MORE PREPARED

01:51:14.267 --> 01:51:16.503
SO WE DO HAVE HAVE PARTICIPATED

01:51:16.569 --> 01:51:17.570
IN EXERCISES WITH P.

01:51:17.637 --> 01:51:19.139
JEANNIE -- ON EXERCISING

01:51:19.205 --> 01:51:20.340
THE PROTOCOLS A NOTIFICATION

01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:20.974
BUT IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:21.808
QUESTION CORRECTLY YOU'RE

01:51:21.875 --> 01:51:23.476
ACTUALLY SUGGESTING TURNING

01:51:23.543 --> 01:51:25.278
THE POWER OFF PRO ACTIVELY

01:51:25.345 --> 01:51:26.379
YEAH I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:51:26.446 --> 01:51:27.547
CERTAINLY SOME TO TALK ABOUT

01:51:27.614 --> 01:51:29.682
AND CONSIDER -- WE CERTAINLY

01:51:29.749 --> 01:51:30.650
BELIEVE IN THE CONCEPT OF

01:51:30.717 --> 01:51:32.118
EXERCISING IN TRAINING AND

01:51:32.185 --> 01:51:32.886
YOU WANT TO TRAIN LIKE YOU'RE

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:33.953
GONNA FIGHT TOTAL YOU CAN

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:36.623
BUY IT THAT WAY FOR SURE

01:51:36.689 --> 01:51:38.224
THANK YOU SENATOR STONE SENATOR

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:41.327
RUBIO THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU

TERRITORIES ACROSS THE STATE

02:01:08.494 --> 02:01:09.595
I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER WITH

02:01:09.662 --> 02:01:12.031
ME BUT IT'S SIMILAR MAGNITUDE

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:13.366
SO AND THEN DO WE KNOW HOW

02:01:13.432 --> 02:01:14.934
MANY TOTAL MEDICAL BASELINE

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:16.235
ALLOWANCE CUSTOMERS ARE WITHIN

02:01:16.302 --> 02:01:17.637
ALL THE AYE YOU TERRITORY DO

02:01:17.703 --> 02:01:19.405
YOU GUYS HAVE THAT INFORMATION

02:01:19.472 --> 02:01:20.606
I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME RIGHT

02:01:20.673 --> 02:01:22.308
NOW NO BUT IT'S SIMILAR ABOUT

02:01:22.375 --> 02:01:24.010
MAGNITUDES TO -- P.

02:01:24.076 --> 02:01:25.645
JEANNIE IN TERMS OF PROPORTION

TO THE OVERALL CUSTOMER ACCOUNT

02:01:29.382 --> 02:01:31.117
AND IS YOUR SENSE THAT IT IS

02:01:31.183 --> 02:01:33.653
NOT NECESSARILY A COMPREHENSIVE

02:01:33.719 --> 02:01:35.321
ACCOUNTING WHO IS OPTED IN THE

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:37.223
MEDICAL BASS LINE VERSUS WHO IS

02:01:37.289 --> 02:01:39.525
ACTUALLY MEDICALLY VULNERABLE

02:01:39.592 --> 02:01:41.060
I I KNOW THE MAYOR TOM RIGHT

02:01:41.127 --> 02:01:43.062
THOSE WHO NEED REFRIGERATION

OR SOMEONE'S IT WAS ON DIALYSIS

02:01:48.567 --> 02:01:50.269
BUT NOT INTO ASSISTED LIVING

02:01:50.336 --> 02:01:51.404
FACILITY THAT MIGHT NOT BE

02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:53.005
CAPTURES YOUR SENSE THAT IS

02:01:53.072 --> 02:01:55.408
AN INCOMPLETE COUNT -- IF WE

02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:57.109
SOLELY USE MEDICAL BASELINE

02:01:57.176 --> 02:01:59.879
AS THE SORT OF -- BASS LINE IF

02:01:59.945 --> 02:02:02.081
YOU WILL OF WHO'S VULNERABLE

02:02:02.148 --> 02:02:03.749
THAT IS CORRECT THAT IS IT IS

02:02:03.816 --> 02:02:05.251
INCOMPLETE AND FOR TWO REASONS

02:02:05.317 --> 02:02:06.819
SO FULL ONE IS THAT THOSE

02:02:06.886 --> 02:02:08.020
PROGRAMS WERE NOT DESIGNED

02:02:08.087 --> 02:02:09.689
AS AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE

02:02:09.755 --> 02:02:11.724
OF PROGRAM SO THERE MEDIA

02:02:11.791 --> 02:02:13.959
CUSTOMERS WHO COULD BE SOMEHOW

02:02:14.026 --> 02:02:16.462
MEDICALLY DEPENDENT HOME WHO

02:02:16.529 --> 02:02:18.464
ARE NOT CURRENTLY REGISTERED

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:20.366
BUT THE SECOND REASON IS ALSO

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:22.368
THE MASTER METER -- ISSUE

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:24.804
WHERE AT LARGE BUILDINGS

02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:26.405
MOBILE HOME PARKS AND OTHER

02:02:26.472 --> 02:02:28.507
FACILITIES -- COULD BE BEHIND

02:02:28.574 --> 02:02:30.710
ONE METER WITH A HUNDRED SO

02:02:30.776 --> 02:02:32.278
FULL OF PEOPLE BEHIND THEM SOME

02:02:32.344 --> 02:02:34.413
OF THEM COULD BE L.

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:35.881
MEDICALLY DEPENDENT OTHERS MAY

02:02:35.948 --> 02:02:37.683
NOT BE BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:39.485
THE UTILITY SEES THEY DON'T

02:02:39.552 --> 02:02:40.886
SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE

02:02:40.953 --> 02:02:43.122
BEHIND THE MEAT OR OMIT SO

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:45.424
THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WITH THAT

02:02:45.491 --> 02:02:47.626
MAKES THIS INFORMATION HIGHLY

02:02:47.693 --> 02:02:48.961
IT THAT UTILITIES OF HIGHLY

02:02:49.028 --> 02:02:50.896
INCOMPLETE WE I SEE CUSTOMER

02:02:50.963 --> 02:02:52.598
ACCOUNTS THAT'S WHAT WE SEE

02:02:52.665 --> 02:02:54.300
RIGHT AND SO YOU TAKE SOMEWHERE

02:02:54.366 --> 02:02:55.835
LIKE THE JEWISH HOME FOR THE

02:02:55.901 --> 02:02:57.870
AGING THE LARGEST SENIORS --

LIVING A SINGLE FACILITY

02:03:03.375 --> 02:03:05.811
WITH ONE METER SUMMER -- YOU

02:03:05.878 --> 02:03:07.646
KNOW SELF DEALING WITH SEVERE

02:03:07.713 --> 02:03:09.148
DEGENERATIVE DISORDERS SUMMER

02:03:09.215 --> 02:03:11.283
AGING IS A PLACE AND -- YOU

02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:12.885
KNOW VARYING DEGREES OF RISK

AT BACK OF DIESEL GENERATION

02:03:18.124 --> 02:03:20.326
SO THOSE PEOPLE MY GRANDMOTHER

02:03:20.392 --> 02:03:22.228

02:04:42.508 --> 02:04:44.844
INDICATE TO YOU -- SOMETHING

02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:46.712
BEYOND THE MEDICAL BASS LINE

02:04:46.779 --> 02:04:47.980
I CAN'T I CAN'T SPEAK TO

02:04:48.047 --> 02:04:49.348
WHETHER WE NEED SUCH AUTHORITY

02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:51.717
IT -- BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WE

02:04:51.784 --> 02:04:53.485
WE ARE WORKING WITH -- BOTH

02:04:53.552 --> 02:04:54.820
FEDERAL AND STATE HEALTH AND

02:04:54.887 --> 02:04:56.589
HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES ON

02:04:56.655 --> 02:04:58.123
THE DATA SETS THAT THEY HAVE

02:04:58.190 --> 02:04:59.692
IN EXPLORING WHAT ADDITIONAL

02:04:59.758 --> 02:05:01.527
DATA SETS THEY MAY HAVE THAT

02:05:01.594 --> 02:05:03.629
WE NEED TO COMBINE -- RIGHT NOW

02:05:03.696 --> 02:05:04.930
I KNOW SOME OF THE FOCUS HAS

02:05:04.997 --> 02:05:06.332
BEEN ON SORT FOR FOR EXAMPLE

02:05:06.398 --> 02:05:08.000
MEDIC MEDICARE AS WELL AS MEDI

02:05:08.067 --> 02:05:09.902
CAL THE DATA SETS TO LOOK AT

02:05:09.969 --> 02:05:11.170
BUT AGAIN TRYING TO THAN THAT

02:05:11.237 --> 02:05:13.038
TO STILL THAT DOWN TO WHICH

02:05:13.105 --> 02:05:14.607
ONES THAT ARE VULNERABLE FROM

02:05:14.673 --> 02:05:16.242
A POWER PERSPECTIVE RIGHT --

02:05:16.308 --> 02:05:17.476
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SLATE ALL OF

02:05:17.543 --> 02:05:20.379
THEM RIGHT -- SO WE ARE WORKING

02:05:20.446 --> 02:05:22.214
WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND

02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:24.350
OUR SEE PAGE PARTNERS -- ON

02:05:24.416 --> 02:05:26.118
THE AND POWER PROGRAM WHICH IS

02:05:26.185 --> 02:05:27.887
OF ALLOW WHICH WOULD PROVIDE

02:05:27.953 --> 02:05:30.990
SOME MORE SPECIFICITY MON ON

02:05:31.056 --> 02:05:32.558
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITHIN

02:05:32.625 --> 02:05:34.760
THOSE CATEGORIES -- BUT AGAIN

02:05:34.827 --> 02:05:36.161
THOSE THOSE DATA SETS AREN'T

02:05:36.228 --> 02:05:37.796
FULLY COMPREHENSIVE FOR EXAMPLE

02:05:37.863 --> 02:05:39.431
THE EMPOWER PROGRAM THAT THE

02:05:39.498 --> 02:05:40.933
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RUNS WHICH

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.601
WOULD ALLOW US ACCESS OF THE

02:05:42.668 --> 02:05:44.637
-- LOCAL AGENCIES TO REQUEST

02:05:44.703 --> 02:05:46.105
A DATA SETS OF VULNERABLE

02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:47.539
POPULATIONS WITHIN THE MEDICAL

02:05:47.606 --> 02:05:49.375
PROGRAM OR MEDICARE PROGRAM

02:05:49.441 --> 02:05:50.976
-- IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GIVE

02:05:51.043 --> 02:05:52.144
CONTACT INFORMATION TO GIVE

02:05:52.211 --> 02:05:53.412
THEIR THEIR ADDRESS BUT IT

02:05:53.479 --> 02:05:54.580
DOESN'T ACTUALLY GIVE THEIR

02:05:54.647 --> 02:05:56.215
PHONE NUMBER RIGHT SO THE DATA

02:05:56.282 --> 02:05:57.616
SETS CAN GIVE US A BROADER

02:05:57.683 --> 02:06:00.019
SCOPE BUT THE CATEGORIES OF

02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:01.487
OF INFORMATION ELEMENTS IN

02:06:01.553 --> 02:06:03.222
THOSE DATA SETS AGAIN THEY

02:06:03.289 --> 02:06:04.857
WERE DESIGNED FROM AN EMERGENCY

02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:06.492
RESPONSE PERSPECTIVE SO WE

02:06:06.558 --> 02:06:07.493
WOULD NEED TO THINK THROUGH

02:06:07.559 --> 02:06:08.928
HOW TO BROADEN THE DATA SET TO

02:06:08.994 --> 02:06:10.796
BE ABLE TO USE IT EFFECTIVELY

02:06:10.863 --> 02:06:12.264
UNDER EMERGENCY RESPONSE

02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:13.699
CONSIDERATIONS I KNOW YOU'VE

02:06:13.766 --> 02:06:15.534
REACHED OUT TO COUNTIES AND

02:06:15.601 --> 02:06:17.169
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL WITH

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:18.504
SOMEONE OF A SOLICITATION IF

02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:19.705
YOU WILL OF SORT OF WHAT THEY

02:06:19.772 --> 02:06:22.007
SEE IN THEIR MAP OF CRITICAL

02:06:22.074 --> 02:06:23.442
POPULATIONS AND CRITICAL

02:06:23.509 --> 02:06:24.910
INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE DOES

02:06:24.977 --> 02:06:27.279
THAT -- INTERFACE STAND DO

02:06:27.346 --> 02:06:29.014
YOU HAVE -- YES WE HAVE A

02:06:29.081 --> 02:06:30.282
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM

02:06:30.349 --> 02:06:31.917
UNIT WITHIN OUR STATE FRED

02:06:31.984 --> 02:06:33.719
ASSESSMENT CENTER ON THAT HAS

02:06:33.786 --> 02:06:36.288
DEFINED -- -- STATE CRITICAL

02:06:36.355 --> 02:06:37.523
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN THERE'S

02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:39.758
A BROADER THAT'S THAT'S A

02:06:39.825 --> 02:06:40.960
SORT OF THE THE HIGHEST CRITIC

02:06:41.026 --> 02:06:42.428
CRITICALITY IF YOU WILL AND

02:06:42.494 --> 02:06:43.529
THEN WE HAVE BROADER DATA

02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:45.264
SETS THAT WE USE WITHIN ARCGIS

02:06:45.331 --> 02:06:46.832
DEPARTMENT THAT IDENTIFIES

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:48.200
ALL THE FIRE POLICE STATE

02:06:48.267 --> 02:06:50.069
POLICE STATIONS FIRE STATIONS

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:51.704
HEALTHCARE FACILITIES I'M SO

02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:53.472
WE CAN OVERLY THOSE IN OVER

02:06:53.539 --> 02:06:55.774
THE MAPS THAT WE RECEIVE FROM

02:06:55.841 --> 02:06:57.076
THE UTILITIES ON THE PUBLIC

02:06:57.142 --> 02:06:58.610
SAFETY DO YOU HAVE ADEQUATE

02:06:58.677 --> 02:07:00.179
DATA THOUGH FROM THE COUNTIES

02:07:00.245 --> 02:07:01.847
ON THAT FRONT AT THIS POINT TO

02:07:01.914 --> 02:07:03.515
HAVE A SO THAT WE AT THE STATE

02:07:03.582 --> 02:07:05.751
LEVEL OF A COMPREHENSIVE DATA

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:07.219
SAID THAT WOULD BE TOO BROAD

02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:08.587
A STATEMENT TO SAY IT ADEQUATE

02:07:08.654 --> 02:07:10.155
ACROSS THE BOARD SO NOT SO

02:07:10.222 --> 02:07:11.824
THERE ARE PROBABLY ADDITIONAL

02:07:11.890 --> 02:07:13.325
INFORMATION ELEMENTS THAT WE

02:07:13.392 --> 02:07:14.793
WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:16.495
A MORE COMPREHENSIVE DATA SET

02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:17.596
GOOD BECAUSE AGAIN MOST OF OUR

02:07:17.663 --> 02:07:18.797
DATA SETS COME FROM A STATE

02:07:18.864 --> 02:07:20.966
PERSPECTIVE -- SO IT WOULD

02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:22.034
IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU WHERE

02:07:22.101 --> 02:07:23.302
YOU WANT TO DRAW THE LINE OF

02:07:23.369 --> 02:07:25.637
TRACKING ALL FACILITIES SO IF

02:07:25.704 --> 02:07:27.373
YOU'D INDUSTRY FINAL QUESTION

02:07:27.439 --> 02:07:30.409
HERE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE GOT

02:07:30.476 --> 02:07:32.211
A HUGE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:07:32.277 --> 02:07:34.246
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW

02:07:34.313 --> 02:07:35.848
-- EVEN IF WE'RE COMMUNICATING

02:07:35.914 --> 02:07:36.782
IN THE RIGHT WAY TO YOUR

02:07:36.849 --> 02:07:38.317
MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMER

02:07:38.384 --> 02:07:40.219
SAID IT'S STILL AN ADEQUATE

02:07:40.285 --> 02:07:42.988
-- PERHAPS SB ONE SIXTY SEVEN

02:07:43.055 --> 02:07:44.656
OR THAT AN EFFORT THEY'RE

02:07:44.723 --> 02:07:46.458
YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN -- CAN BE

02:07:46.525 --> 02:07:48.260
USED TO SORT OF REMEDY SOME OF

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:50.596
THESE GAPS -- BUT EVEN IF WE

02:07:50.662 --> 02:07:52.531
DO IDENTIFY ALL THESE PEOPLE

02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:53.899
AND THEN WE GO TALK TO THEM

02:07:53.966 --> 02:07:55.834
AND SEND THEM JUST PULLED UP

02:07:55.901 --> 02:07:59.204
PREPARE FOR POWER DOWN -- SEND

02:07:59.271 --> 02:08:03.475
THEM THIS THIS WEBSITE -- I SEE

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:07.846
A BIG PICTURE OF OF -- BACKPACK

02:08:07.913 --> 02:08:11.083
SOME CANS A BATTERY A POCKET

02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:14.286
KNIFE AND SOME WATER -- AS THIS

02:08:14.353 --> 02:08:19.191
SORT OF -- BASIC RECOMMENDATION

02:08:19.258 --> 02:08:20.259
HERE YOU GO YOUR POWER IS

02:08:20.325 --> 02:08:21.760
GOING TO BE OFF FOR HALF A

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:23.896
DAY MAYBE THREE DAYS IT'LL

02:08:23.962 --> 02:08:25.030
BE OFTEN IT SAYS WHAT IF I'M

02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:26.565
DEPEND ELECTRICITY FOR MEDICAL

02:08:26.632 --> 02:08:28.667
DEVICES SAYS CONSIDER A SAFE

02:08:28.734 --> 02:08:30.369
BACKUP POWER SOURCE SUCH AS A

02:08:30.436 --> 02:08:32.638
GENERATOR OR UNINTERRUPTIBLE

02:08:32.704 --> 02:08:34.840
POWER SUPPLY WE TALKED EARLIER

02:08:34.907 --> 02:08:36.041
ABOUT COMMUNICATING IN THE

02:08:36.108 --> 02:08:38.043
MESSAGE I DON'T SEE ANYWHERE

02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:39.478
TO CLICK HERE TO SAY HOW DO I

02:08:39.545 --> 02:08:41.280
GET ONE OF THOSE DEVICES HOW DO

02:08:41.346 --> 02:08:43.115
I ACTUALLY BACK MY POWER UP SO

02:08:43.182 --> 02:08:44.883
I I HAVE TO GO OUT I'M EIGHTY

02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:46.418
FIVE YEAR OLD WOMAN LIVING THE

02:08:46.485 --> 02:08:47.719
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY DEPENDING

02:08:47.786 --> 02:08:49.288
ON YOUR CONDITION I GOT A

02:08:49.354 --> 02:08:51.957
OKAY I GOT I GOT THE NOTICE WE

02:08:52.024 --> 02:08:53.992
IDENTIFY THE PERSON NOW THEY

02:08:54.059 --> 02:08:56.428
GO OUT NAY SAY I GO TO THE HOME

02:08:56.495 --> 02:08:59.364
DEPOT AND GET A GENERATOR I

02:08:59.431 --> 02:09:01.934
CAN'T EVEN DRIVE I DO THERE'S

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.269
NO WHERE TO CLICK LIKE ONCE

02:09:04.336 --> 02:09:05.871
WE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIES PEOPLE

02:09:05.938 --> 02:09:07.606
NOTIFY THEM I DON'T SEE THE

02:09:07.673 --> 02:09:10.209
TOOLS TO ACTUALLY EMPOWER

02:09:10.275 --> 02:09:11.110
PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THESE

02:09:11.176 --> 02:09:13.278
ISSUES AND I DON'T THINK THAT

02:09:13.345 --> 02:09:15.280
SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT PUTTING

02:09:15.347 --> 02:09:17.282
A SOLAR BATTERY SYSTEM AT A

02:09:17.349 --> 02:09:18.617
NURSING HOME WILL JUST TAKE

02:09:18.684 --> 02:09:20.219
TOO LONG SO LIKE WE'RE GONNA

02:09:20.285 --> 02:09:21.520
HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT DOWN

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:23.288
THE LINE LET'S KICK THAT CAN

02:09:23.355 --> 02:09:25.257
DOWN THE ROAD WE KNOW FULL WELL

02:09:25.324 --> 02:09:26.425
THAT WE CAN GET THE SYSTEMS

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:27.459
UP AND RUNNING NOW AND I'M

02:09:27.526 --> 02:09:28.460
NOT JUST TALKING TO NURSING

02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:29.828
HOMES HERE TOO I'M TALKING

02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:31.964
ABOUT GASOLINE STATIONS IN

02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:33.499
OUR OIL REFINERIES EVEN THAT

02:09:33.565 --> 02:09:35.134
IT WE RELIED FOR OUR ENERGY

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:36.201
SYSTEMS IN THE REGION WE'RE

02:09:36.268 --> 02:09:37.436
TALKING ABOUT PUMPING STATIONS

02:09:37.503 --> 02:09:39.271
ACTUALLY KEEP THE WATER MOVING

02:09:39.338 --> 02:09:41.440
BUT THINGS THAT INDIVIDUALS

02:09:41.507 --> 02:09:43.609
CAN DO OR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC

02:09:43.675 --> 02:09:45.444
FACILITIES CAN DO I STILL

02:09:45.511 --> 02:09:46.945
THINK WE'RE LACKING A A STATE

02:09:47.012 --> 02:09:48.313
WIDE DEFINITION THAT ACTUALLY

02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:50.149
IDENTIFIES THEM COMPREHENSIVELY

02:09:50.215 --> 02:09:51.950
THE BE A SOLUTION SET BECAUSE

02:09:52.017 --> 02:09:53.085
THAT'S SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

02:09:53.152 --> 02:09:53.952
IN THE BUDGET CORRECT ME

02:09:54.019 --> 02:09:54.920
IF I'M WRONG BUT THAT WAS

02:09:54.987 --> 02:09:56.622
REALLY INTENDED MOSTLY JUST

02:09:56.688 --> 02:09:57.956
FOR STATE FACILITIES THAT

02:09:58.023 --> 02:09:59.258
THAT SORT OF TOP TIER LIST

02:09:59.324 --> 02:10:00.125
IS THAT CORRECT MISS THOMAS

02:10:00.192 --> 02:10:01.860
JACOBS THIS IS STILL BEING

02:10:01.927 --> 02:10:03.262
EVALUATED IT'S LOOKING AT BOTH

02:10:03.328 --> 02:10:04.763
STATE AND LOCAL NEEDS IS IT

02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:06.331
FAIR TO SAY THAT SEVENTY FIVE

02:10:06.398 --> 02:10:08.400
MILLION IS SOMEWHAT OF A DROP

02:10:08.467 --> 02:10:09.468
IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO THE

02:10:09.535 --> 02:10:11.170
TOTAL NEED FOR BACKUP POWER

02:10:11.236 --> 02:10:14.406
GENERATION CITY SO THAT'S TO ME

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:15.908
THE PROJECT HERE THAT I HOPE WE

02:10:15.974 --> 02:10:17.776
CAN ALL ENDEAVOR IN TOGETHER IS

02:10:17.843 --> 02:10:20.879
HOW TO FILL THAT GAP QUICKLY --

02:10:20.946 --> 02:10:22.881
AND I DON'T THINK DIESEL POWER

02:10:22.948 --> 02:10:24.716
GENERATION SOLELY IS GONNA BE

02:10:24.783 --> 02:10:26.318
THE ANSWER I THINK THERE'S A

02:10:26.385 --> 02:10:27.553
LOT OF FOLKS AND HOPING THIS

02:10:27.619 --> 02:10:28.754
NEXT PANEL WE CAN START TO

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:30.222
DIG INTO THAT BUT FROM THE

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:31.490
DISABILITY RIGHTS COMMUNITY

02:10:31.557 --> 02:10:33.158
PERSPECTIVE FROM ALL THOSE

02:10:33.225 --> 02:10:34.893
FOLKS OUT THERE WHO MIGHT NOT

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:36.962
BE CAPTURED -- AND FROM THOSE

02:10:37.029 --> 02:10:38.530
CRITICAL INDUSTRY SAYS NOT JUST

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:39.998
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT

02:10:40.065 --> 02:10:41.233
BUT THOSE PRIVATE FACILITIES

02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:43.001
THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED -- I

02:10:43.068 --> 02:10:43.802
THINK WE OUGHT TO DELIVER THIS

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:45.137
SESSION THANK YOU SENATOR AND

02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:46.838
AND WE WILL NOW BEFORE I GO TO

02:10:46.905 --> 02:10:48.340
MY QUESTIONS WILL GO TO SENATOR

02:10:48.407 --> 02:10:50.108
WIENER THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:10:50.175 --> 02:10:51.543
MISTER CHAIRMAN I APOLOGIZE

02:10:51.610 --> 02:10:53.378
THAT I HAD TO STEP OUT IT

02:10:53.445 --> 02:10:55.280
WAS UNAVOIDABLE SO AND I HOPE

02:10:55.347 --> 02:10:57.015
I DON'T -- AS QUESTIONS ARE

02:10:57.082 --> 02:11:00.385
ALREADY ASKED -- I SUGGEST --

02:11:00.452 --> 02:11:01.420
IF YOU THESE ARE ALL THE P.

02:11:01.486 --> 02:11:02.688
GINNY AND AGAIN NOTHING

02:11:02.754 --> 02:11:04.289
PERSONAL MISTER SAYING AYE AYE

02:11:04.356 --> 02:11:06.124
AND YOUR HER REPRESENTING A

02:11:06.191 --> 02:11:07.960
COMPANY THAT HAS SOME REAL --

02:11:08.026 --> 02:11:11.296
-- CHALLENGES -- SO FIRST OF

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:12.698
ALL THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE

02:11:12.764 --> 02:11:14.533
INFRASTRUCTURE WORK -- THAT'S

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:16.802
HAPPENING ABOUT THE -- I FORGET

02:11:16.868 --> 02:11:18.637
THE TERM BETTER SEGMENTATION SO

02:11:18.704 --> 02:11:20.672
THAT THE SHUTDOWNS CAN BE MORE

02:11:20.739 --> 02:11:21.873
STRATEGIC AND THEN OF COURSE

02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:24.376
THE OVERALL -- HARDENING TRIED

02:11:24.443 --> 02:11:26.345
-- ARE REDUCE THE RISK OF THE

02:11:26.411 --> 02:11:27.512
INFRASTRUCTURE OF P.

02:11:27.579 --> 02:11:30.315
GINNY CAUSING WILDFIRES I GUESS

02:11:30.382 --> 02:11:32.284
ONE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS WHY

02:11:32.351 --> 02:11:33.585
WASN'T THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WORK

02:11:33.652 --> 02:11:36.355
DONE A LONG TIME AGO -- AND

02:11:36.421 --> 02:11:37.356
I I'M NOT I'M NOT JUST TRYING

02:11:37.422 --> 02:11:39.191
TO BE ARGUMENTATIVE BUT I I

02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:41.526
THINK THE PUBLIC DESERVES AN

02:11:41.593 --> 02:11:44.630
ANSWER ABOUT WHAT IN TERMS WHY

02:11:44.696 --> 02:11:45.931
THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN A LONG TIME

02:11:45.998 --> 02:11:48.100
AGO -- YOU KNOW REPAIRS OF THE

02:11:48.166 --> 02:11:49.568
PAYING MONEY FOR A LONG TIME

02:11:49.635 --> 02:11:51.136
AND AND I UNDERSTAND THE P.

02:11:51.203 --> 02:11:53.372
GINNY SYSTEM IS OLDER AND --

02:11:53.438 --> 02:11:55.574
IT'S A HUGE SERVICE AREA AND

02:11:55.641 --> 02:11:57.709
NOTES MANY CHALLENGES -- BUT

02:11:57.776 --> 02:11:58.910
WHAT TOPPING THEY SHOULD HAVE

02:11:58.977 --> 02:12:00.579
HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO NOT

02:12:00.646 --> 02:12:02.814
ONLY WITH THAT OF A WAITED --

02:12:02.881 --> 02:12:05.317
LIKELY TO MAYES WILDFIRES BUT

02:12:05.384 --> 02:12:07.619
WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS

02:12:07.686 --> 02:12:09.721
CONVERSATION ABOUT POTENTIALLY

02:12:09.788 --> 02:12:11.590
MASSIVE OVERLY BROAD POWER

02:12:11.657 --> 02:12:13.558
SHUT DOWN SO BECAUSE WE'LL

02:12:13.625 --> 02:12:15.761
REFINERIES TO FLARE -- OR THE

02:12:15.827 --> 02:12:17.462
BECAUSE SMALL BUSINESSES TO

02:12:17.529 --> 02:12:18.897
HAVE TO SHUT DOWN A POTENTIALLY

02:12:18.964 --> 02:12:20.766
CLOSE UP SHOP ENTIRELY OR

02:12:20.832 --> 02:12:21.967
CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR

02:12:22.034 --> 02:12:26.405
MEDICATION -- WHAT -- SO WHY

02:12:26.471 --> 02:12:27.606
SENATOR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

02:12:27.673 --> 02:12:30.342
I HARD FROM TO SPECULATE

02:12:30.409 --> 02:12:32.210
AS TO WHY DOES NOT THE AREA

02:12:32.277 --> 02:12:33.845
THAT HAVE FOCUSED IN -- I

02:12:33.912 --> 02:12:35.614
TRANSITION INTO THIS ROLE OF

02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:37.749
SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR OF FROM

02:12:37.816 --> 02:12:39.284
OUR GAS OPERATIONS FOR THE

02:12:39.351 --> 02:12:41.787
ORGANIZATION -- AND CHARTED

02:12:41.853 --> 02:12:43.555
WITH THE FOCUS ON LOOKING AT

02:12:43.622 --> 02:12:46.191
-- WILDFIRE RISK FROM A ACID

02:12:46.258 --> 02:12:47.659
AND RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

02:12:47.726 --> 02:12:48.960
VERY SIMILAR FRAMEWORK THAT'S

02:12:49.027 --> 02:12:50.128
EMPLOYED IN THE NUCLEAR

02:12:50.195 --> 02:12:52.464
INDUSTRY THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY

02:12:52.531 --> 02:12:54.900
THE NATURAL GAS THE IN THE

02:12:54.966 --> 02:12:57.002
OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY THAT'S

02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:59.504
REALLY WHAT MY FOCUS HAS BEEN

02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:01.273
-- IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:03.208
WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER WALL

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:05.143
FAR CAUSED BY OUR ELECTRICAL

02:13:05.210 --> 02:13:07.145
ACID IN INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S

02:13:07.212 --> 02:13:09.581
REALLY BEEN -- GO FORWARD --

02:13:09.648 --> 02:13:12.684
FOR ME THE AS I'VE LOOKED AT

02:13:12.751 --> 02:13:14.086
THE THE THE INFORMATION THAT'S

02:13:14.152 --> 02:13:16.455
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE -- ON ON

02:13:16.521 --> 02:13:17.622
THE ON THE SPECIFIC TOPIC

02:13:17.689 --> 02:13:18.657
BECAUSE I KNOW THIS TOPIC IN

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:19.691
THIS QUESTION IS ON A LOT OF

02:13:19.758 --> 02:13:20.992
PEOPLE'S MINDS BUT THAT'S NOT

02:13:21.059 --> 02:13:23.228
BEEN MY AREA OF FOCUS WE WE

02:13:23.295 --> 02:13:24.930
HAVE YOU SEEN WHEN YOU LOOK

02:13:24.996 --> 02:13:26.498
AT THE THE COURSE OF THE TIME

02:13:26.565 --> 02:13:28.667
PERIOD BETWEEN TWENTY TWELVE

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:30.902
AND -- THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF

02:13:30.969 --> 02:13:32.671
FIRE THREAT DISTRICT MAPS THAT

02:13:32.738 --> 02:13:33.739
WERE PUT TOGETHER THE DROUGHT

02:13:33.805 --> 02:13:35.040
CONDITIONS THAT TOOK PLACE THE

02:13:35.107 --> 02:13:37.309
CLIMATE IN WHICH ARE LOGICAL

02:13:37.376 --> 02:13:38.944
ASSETS ARE WE'RE SURROUNDED

02:13:39.010 --> 02:13:41.346
WITH A DRASTICALLY CHANGED --

02:13:41.413 --> 02:13:42.647
AND I'M NOT BLAMING ALL OF THAT

02:13:42.714 --> 02:13:44.683
ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE -- SO AND

02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:45.584
THERE'S THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING

02:13:45.650 --> 02:13:48.487
NOW THAT -- WE'RE COMMENSURATE

02:13:48.553 --> 02:13:49.888
WITH REDUCING THAT RISK BOTH

02:13:49.955 --> 02:13:51.022
IN TERMS OF INSPECTIONS IN

02:13:51.089 --> 02:13:52.491
TERMS OF EDUCATION IN TERMS OF

02:13:52.557 --> 02:13:54.126
HARDENING THOSE ARE ALL OF THE

02:13:54.192 --> 02:13:56.695
THINGS THAT WE PUT INTO ACTION

02:13:56.762 --> 02:13:58.730
-- SINCE -- ABOUT BEEN PART OF

02:13:58.797 --> 02:14:02.501
THIS -- PART OF THIS -- EFFORT

02:14:02.567 --> 02:14:04.703
YEAH AND I -- -- GUY ARE YOUR

02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:06.338
MORE RECENT IT'S JUST I JUST

02:14:06.405 --> 02:14:07.739
FIND IT REALLY UNACCEPTABLE

02:14:07.806 --> 02:14:09.875
THE LEVEL OF -- INFRASTRUCTURE

02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:11.510
DETERIORATION THAT WAS ALLOWED

02:14:11.576 --> 02:14:12.544
TO HAPPEN THAT P.

02:14:12.611 --> 02:14:14.746
GINNY AND AND NOW NOT ONLY

02:14:14.813 --> 02:14:15.947
DO WE SEE THE WILD FIRES

02:14:16.014 --> 02:14:17.549
BUT WE SEE THESE POTENTIALLY

02:14:17.616 --> 02:14:19.351
CATASTROPHIC OF POWER SHUT

02:14:19.418 --> 02:14:21.386
DOWN AND ONE WHEN I SHUT DOWN

02:14:21.453 --> 02:14:25.424
HAPPENS WHAT'S THE FOCUSING

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:27.259
ON BUSINESSES BOTH SMALL AND

02:14:27.325 --> 02:14:29.528
LARGE SIR UP WHAT IS THEIR

02:14:29.594 --> 02:14:31.930
RECOURSE SO YOU HAVE OF WHAT

02:14:31.997 --> 02:14:33.965
WE SAW YOU KNOW THE THE -- THE

02:14:34.032 --> 02:14:35.100
WILLINGNESS AND I'M NOT USUALLY

02:14:35.167 --> 02:14:36.435
ALIGNED WITH THE OIL INDUSTRY

02:14:36.501 --> 02:14:39.438
BUT THEIR THEIR LETTER WAS --

02:14:39.504 --> 02:14:41.940
WAS VERY COMPELLING -- THAT YOU

02:14:42.007 --> 02:14:44.309
ARE YOU KNOW I I MEAN THAT'S

02:14:44.376 --> 02:14:47.112
PRETTY PROBLEMATIC TO TO TO

02:14:47.179 --> 02:14:48.680
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN BUT THAT'S

02:14:48.747 --> 02:14:51.149
JUST A ABOUT THAT ONE THE CIVIC

02:14:51.216 --> 02:14:53.351
STREAM EXAMPLE THERE'S ALSO --

02:14:53.418 --> 02:14:54.686
THAN WHAT I MENTIONED THAT AT

02:14:54.753 --> 02:14:56.388
THE BEGINNING LESSONS YOU KNOW

02:14:56.455 --> 02:14:58.123
DOES LACK OF INSURANCE DOESN'T

02:14:58.190 --> 02:14:59.958
COVER IT IN THESE BUSINESSES

02:15:00.025 --> 02:15:01.827
-- IT'S IT'S DEVASTATING TO

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:03.728
THEM AND SO WHAT WHAT IS THERE

02:15:03.795 --> 02:15:05.163
WHAT IS A RECOURSE AND WHAT'S

02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:07.399
A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR FOR

02:15:07.466 --> 02:15:10.368
PGA ANY NOT TO ERR ON THE SIDE

02:15:10.435 --> 02:15:12.137
OF OVERLY BROAD POWER SHUT

02:15:12.204 --> 02:15:15.073
OFF SO SO RESPECTFULLY CENTERS

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:16.842
NOT A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE

02:15:16.908 --> 02:15:19.077
IT'S REALLY A PUBLIC SAFETY

02:15:19.144 --> 02:15:22.113
OF FOCUS FOR US I I UNDERSTAND

02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:23.648
YOU PARTICULAR KIND OF THE

02:15:23.715 --> 02:15:25.183
THE THE TWO SIDES OF IT FROM

02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:26.351
MY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

02:15:26.418 --> 02:15:27.986
PERSPECTIVE WE DON'T LOOK AT IT

02:15:28.053 --> 02:15:29.621
THAT WAY WE LOOK AT IT IN TERMS

02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:32.457
OF THE RISK OF DEHYDRATION AS A

02:15:32.524 --> 02:15:34.226
RESULT TO PUBLIC SAFETY IMPACT

02:15:34.292 --> 02:15:35.760
OR AS A RESULT OF NOT DE

02:15:35.827 --> 02:15:38.330
ENERGIZING AND POTENTIALLY

02:15:38.396 --> 02:15:39.331
CAUSING A CATASTROPHIC

02:15:39.397 --> 02:15:41.333
WILDFIRES SO THAT THAT'S-

02:15:41.399 --> 02:15:43.201
REALLY THE RISKS THAT WE ARE

02:15:43.268 --> 02:15:45.904
WEIGHING. IN TERMS OF YOUR

02:15:45.971 --> 02:15:48.673
QUESTION ABOUT THE FINANCIAL

02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:52.410
RECOURSE. THAT'S LEFT UP TO

02:15:52.477 --> 02:15:53.612
WERE WERE TRYING TO BE

02:15:53.678 --> 02:15:54.813
PROACTIVE ON THE COMMUNICATION

02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:56.815
WE LAST WEEK WE HAD A

02:15:56.882 --> 02:15:58.383
DISCUSSION AND A SPECIFIC

02:15:58.450 --> 02:16:00.619
MEETING WITH THE VARIOUS LARGE

02:16:00.685 --> 02:16:02.921
REFINERIES THAT ARE TOPPED OFF

02:16:03.188 --> 02:16:06.658
OF A TRANSMISSION SYSTEM TO BE

02:16:06.725 --> 02:16:09.127
DISCUSSIONS IN TERMS OF THE-

02:16:09.194 --> 02:16:10.795
HEALTH OF OUR SYSTEM IN AND

02:16:10.862 --> 02:16:12.430
WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR OUR

02:16:12.497 --> 02:16:13.598
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM MADE IT BY

02:16:13.665 --> 02:16:16.468
NATURE. IS SPECIAL HUNDRED KV

02:16:16.535 --> 02:16:17.702
AND ABOVE AS MYSTERY NOT TALKED

02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:20.138
ABOUT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF

02:16:20.205 --> 02:16:21.439
RELIABILITY THAT'S BUILT INTO

02:16:21.506 --> 02:16:23.174
IT BECAUSE FROM A- A

02:16:23.241 --> 02:16:25.443
RELIABILITY PERSPECTIVE WE'RE

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:27.012
LOOKING TO REALLY OPERATE THE

02:16:27.078 --> 02:16:28.914
SYSTEM ON A AND MINUS ONE

02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:30.015
CONTINGENCY MEETING IF YOU LOSE

02:16:30.081 --> 02:16:32.017
YOU KNOW A LINE YOU HAVE. BEEN

02:16:32.083 --> 02:16:32.817
IN OTHER FROM A BACKUP

02:16:32.884 --> 02:16:35.320
PERSPECTIVE AND- THE WHOLE

02:16:35.387 --> 02:16:36.555
INTENT BEHIND ENGAGING FOR

02:16:36.621 --> 02:16:38.089
EXAMPLE TO REFINE RECENCY USE

02:16:38.156 --> 02:16:40.025
THAT USE THAT EXAMPLE IS TO.

02:16:40.091 --> 02:16:41.593
MAKE THEM AWARE THAT THIS IS

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:43.995
THE REALITY UNFORTUNATE REALITY

02:16:44.062 --> 02:16:45.330
OF WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY FACED

02:16:45.397 --> 02:16:46.731
WITH AND WHAT WERE LIVING WITH

02:16:46.798 --> 02:16:48.066
A WITHIN THE STATE OF

02:16:48.133 --> 02:16:49.267
CALIFORNIA AND TO ORDER THEM TO

02:16:49.334 --> 02:16:51.636
ALSO HAVE A PLAN. AND FROM A

02:16:51.703 --> 02:16:54.406
RECOURSE PERSPECTIVE. IT'S WE

02:16:54.472 --> 02:16:55.707
LEAVE IT UP TO THEM RIGHT A

02:16:55.774 --> 02:16:56.541
FIFTY FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:58.143
THAT THE DECISION THAT WE MADE

02:16:58.209 --> 02:17:00.145
WAS INACCURATE INAPPROPRIATE

02:17:00.211 --> 02:17:01.613
TARGETED IN IN SOME WAY IT LED

02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:03.648
TO A CERTAIN HARM. THEY THEY

02:17:03.715 --> 02:17:05.483
ALWAYS HAVE A LEGAL RECOURSE

02:17:05.550 --> 02:17:07.319
THAT THEY CAN PURSUE BUT THAT

02:17:07.385 --> 02:17:16.361
THAT'S- I JUST DON'T KNOW. WITH

02:17:16.428 --> 02:17:16.828
ALL RESPECT. TO THE I

02:17:16.895 --> 02:17:25.136
UNDERSTAND. THE P. GINNY WANTS

02:17:25.203 --> 02:17:26.371
TO PROMOTE YOU KNOW. THE SAFETY

02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:27.639
ARGUMENT I'M NOT SAYING THAT P.

02:17:27.706 --> 02:17:29.240
GINNY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT SAFETY

02:17:29.307 --> 02:17:29.841
AT ALL NOT I'M NOT SUGGESTING

02:17:29.908 --> 02:17:31.810
THAT. BUT I ALSO DON'T BUY THE

02:17:31.876 --> 02:17:34.179
ARGUMENT THE PGA ANY. AS AN

02:17:34.245 --> 02:17:34.779
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY THAT IS

02:17:34.846 --> 02:17:36.881
RESPONSIBLE TO ITS-

02:17:36.948 --> 02:17:38.250
SHAREHOLDERS OF PRESUME AT SOME

02:17:38.316 --> 02:17:39.017
POINT COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY

02:17:39.084 --> 02:17:40.385
AND HAVE SHARE HOLDERS WITH

02:17:40.452 --> 02:17:41.353
EQUITY AGAIN. DIED DIED IT'S

02:17:41.419 --> 02:17:42.887
JUST FOCUS JUST ON THE SAFETY

02:17:42.954 --> 02:17:44.389
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT A P. GENIES

02:17:44.456 --> 02:17:46.358
BOTTOM LINE AND AVOIDING. A

02:17:46.424 --> 02:17:48.226
LIABILITY AND AGAIN POWER

02:17:48.293 --> 02:17:48.994
SHUTTLES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY I

02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:49.961
DON'T YOU KNOW THESE THESE

02:17:50.028 --> 02:17:51.429
WILDFIRES A CATASTROPHIC AND WE

THEY DIDN'T BILL THAT GRID OR

02:22:31.542 --> 02:22:32.010
WHY THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT IS

02:22:32.076 --> 02:22:35.280
RESILIENT. BUT WHY THEY DIDN'T

02:22:35.346 --> 02:22:35.880
DO THE THINGS THAT WERE

02:22:35.947 --> 02:22:37.916
NECESSARY AND WHAT I SAW. IT

02:22:37.982 --> 02:22:39.984

02:22:40.051 --> 02:22:40.585

02:23:00.204 --> 02:23:01.806
THINGS HOPEFULLY HAVE CHANGED

02:23:01.873 --> 02:23:07.245
AT PGA. AND I THINK. THAT WILL

02:23:07.312 --> 02:23:10.682
ALLOW FOR THE OPENING. AND THE

02:23:10.748 --> 02:23:12.150
OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT THIRD

02:23:12.216 --> 02:23:13.718

02:24:46.177 --> 02:24:47.545
THE POLYGONS WHEN THEY'RE

02:24:47.612 --> 02:24:48.713
SENDING US THE MAPS WHERE

02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:50.081
EXACTLY IS THE OUTSIDE THE

02:24:50.148 --> 02:24:51.916
BOUNDARY OF THE POLY GONE. SO

02:24:51.983 --> 02:24:53.317
THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL IS AN

02:24:53.384 --> 02:24:55.119
ONGOING PROCESS TO GET TO THE

02:24:55.186 --> 02:24:59.190
LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY. THAT WE

02:24:59.257 --> 02:25:04.762
ALL KNOW WE NEED TO GET TO. THE

02:25:04.829 --> 02:25:06.497
GOOD. AND UP ALL THE RESEARCH

02:25:06.564 --> 02:25:07.231
CENTER I ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY

02:25:07.298 --> 02:25:08.866
WITH WHAT MISS THOMAS JACOBSON

02:25:08.933 --> 02:25:09.500
SAID WE HAVE RECEIVED A

02:25:09.567 --> 02:25:10.368
CLARIFICATION. AS I THINK THE

02:25:10.435 --> 02:25:11.202
GENESIS OF THAT LETTER WAS

02:25:11.269 --> 02:25:12.470
BEGAN THAT OCTOBER EVENT. WHERE

02:25:12.537 --> 02:25:13.337
WE HAD A LOT OF LESSONS

02:25:13.404 --> 02:25:14.539
LEARNED. AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW

02:25:14.605 --> 02:25:16.841
FRANKLY TRIPPED UP IN TERMS OF.

02:25:16.908 --> 02:25:18.109
THE EXTERNAL STICKLER

02:25:18.176 --> 02:25:19.010
COMMUNICATION AND WE COULD HAVE

02:25:19.077 --> 02:25:20.044
DONE BETTER WE NEED TO DO

02:25:20.111 --> 02:25:21.145
BETTER AND THAT WAS KIND OF

02:25:21.212 --> 02:25:22.480
WHAT THAT LED TO AND- SINCE

02:25:22.547 --> 02:25:23.614
THEN WE'VE BEEN PRO ACTIVELY

02:25:23.681 --> 02:25:25.083
ENGAGED WITH MISS THOMAS JACOBS

02:25:25.149 --> 02:25:26.684
AND HER TEAM. TO ENSURE THAT WE

02:25:26.751 --> 02:25:28.052
HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF

02:25:28.119 --> 02:25:29.520
THE EXPECTATIONS INCLUDING

02:25:29.587 --> 02:25:31.889
DEVELOPING A DETAILED FORM.

02:25:31.956 --> 02:25:32.890
THAT WOULD BE SUBMITTED TO THE

02:25:32.957 --> 02:25:34.826
WARNING CENTER AT THE TIME.

02:25:34.892 --> 02:25:36.127
THAT WE DO DO THE ACTIVATION AS

02:25:36.194 --> 02:25:37.595
WELL AS PROVIDING. A

02:25:37.662 --> 02:25:38.696
PRESCRIPTIVE DETAILED

02:25:38.763 --> 02:25:39.931
INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE

02:25:39.997 --> 02:25:41.265
COURSE OF THE EVENTS SO THAT.

02:25:41.332 --> 02:25:42.767
THERE'S COMPLETE STRUCTURED

02:25:42.834 --> 02:25:44.302
THAT'S UNDERSTOOD ON OUR SIDE

02:25:44.368 --> 02:25:46.137
AND WE CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT

02:25:46.204 --> 02:25:47.705
OUR PROCESS SEES. TO BE ABLE TO

02:25:47.772 --> 02:25:51.175
ENSURE. WE PROVIDE. THE DATA IN

02:25:51.242 --> 02:25:52.210
AT THE RIGHT QUALITY CONTROL IN

02:25:52.276 --> 02:25:54.112
PLACE SO THAT. IT A TO THE BEST

02:25:54.178 --> 02:25:56.581
OF OUR EXTENT POSSIBLE. IS AS

02:25:56.647 --> 02:25:58.015
ACCURATE AS A AS A CAN BE AN AS

02:25:58.082 --> 02:25:59.917
TIMELY AS A CANDY. OKAY THAT

02:25:59.984 --> 02:26:01.319
THE ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:26:01.385 --> 02:26:06.624
I A DAY AFTER WHEN. THIS

02:26:06.691 --> 02:26:07.225
OCCURRED. AND I SAW THE LETTER

02:26:07.291 --> 02:26:11.829
AND THEN. IN THIS WAS AFTER THE

02:26:11.896 --> 02:26:12.597
FIRST PS PS THE P. JEANNIE HAD

02:26:12.663 --> 02:26:13.931
DUCTED AND THE COMMUNITY

02:26:13.998 --> 02:26:15.199
OUTRAGE HAT CAME FROM THAT OF

02:26:15.266 --> 02:26:17.168
AND THEN IS NOVEMBER CAME

02:26:17.235 --> 02:26:19.637
NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN WE STARTED

02:26:19.704 --> 02:26:21.739
SEEING THOSE CONDITIONS ARISE

02:26:21.806 --> 02:26:25.176
P. JEANNIE ANNOUNCED THE

02:26:25.243 --> 02:26:27.912
ANTICIPATED PS PS. EVENT IN THE

02:26:27.979 --> 02:26:28.446
LAST MINUTE THEY DIDN'T GO

02:26:28.513 --> 02:26:30.314
FORWARD WITH THAT. PROBABLY

02:26:30.381 --> 02:26:31.149
SHOULD HAVE EVEN THE

02:26:31.215 --> 02:26:32.783
TRANSMISSION WAS A PART OF THAT

02:26:32.850 --> 02:26:34.152
AND THEN WE SAW THE DISASTERS

02:26:34.218 --> 02:26:36.921
OF FROM THAT AND I GUESS A I IS

02:26:36.988 --> 02:26:39.123
I WAS LOOKING AT I SAID. YOU

02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:39.690
KNOW FRANKLY. P. JEANNIE WAS

02:26:39.757 --> 02:26:41.959
KIND OF IN A BAD SPOT. WERE

02:26:42.026 --> 02:26:43.761
THEY GOING TO DO. THAT LETTER

02:26:43.828 --> 02:26:45.429
THOSE REQUIREMENTS FOR SO TOUGH

02:26:45.496 --> 02:26:46.864
THEY WERE NOT PROBABLY NOT

02:26:46.931 --> 02:26:48.566
GOING TO BE ABLE TO. ABIDE BY

02:26:48.633 --> 02:26:51.269
THOSE. BEFORE THAT P. S. P. S.

02:26:51.335 --> 02:26:54.305
S. EVENT WE'RE GOING TO OCCUR.

02:26:54.372 --> 02:26:55.873
AND SO I THINK EVERY JUST

02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:57.074
MYSELF AND THAT THERE'S NO

02:26:57.141 --> 02:26:58.643
EVIDENCE TO SHOW IT THAT THEY-

02:26:58.709 --> 02:27:00.444
THEY TOOK THE CHANCE. THIS TWO

02:27:00.511 --> 02:27:01.379
OR WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA GET IN

02:27:01.445 --> 02:27:03.014
TROUBLE FROM BY NOT FOR

02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:04.348
PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE

02:27:04.415 --> 02:27:05.683
INFORMATION BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO

02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:07.285
IT AT THIS POINT. IS WE TOOK A

02:27:07.351 --> 02:27:08.686
CHANCE AND DIDN'T DIDN'T DE

02:27:08.753 --> 02:27:10.254
ENERGIZED AND THAT BUT THAT'S

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:11.389
JUST MY THINKING ON THAT AND WE

02:27:11.455 --> 02:27:12.523
SAW THAT THE CATASTROPHE AND

02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:15.193
DID THAT. THE DISASTER THAT

02:27:15.259 --> 02:27:16.694
CAME FROM FROM THOSE FIRES OF

02:27:16.761 --> 02:27:18.829
EIGHTEEN BUT OF. WHAT I LIKE TO

02:27:18.896 --> 02:27:20.665
DO IS MISTER ARENA IS GO TO THE

02:27:20.731 --> 02:27:22.366
CALICO I SAW A LITTLE BIT AND

02:27:22.433 --> 02:27:23.367
COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE%

02:27:23.434 --> 02:27:26.604
BIT MORE ON. ON HOW YOU DECIDE

02:27:26.671 --> 02:27:28.372
ON AREAS TO ASK TO POWER DOWN

02:27:28.439 --> 02:27:30.308
IF THERE'S A- IF THERE IS A

02:27:30.374 --> 02:27:33.277
LINE OF SUCCESSION OR PRIORITY

02:27:33.344 --> 02:27:35.379
IN THE EVENT OF AN- EXTREME

02:27:35.446 --> 02:27:37.215
EVENT OR A PS PS OF INVITE YOU

02:27:37.281 --> 02:27:38.583
TO IT. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY AND

02:27:38.649 --> 02:27:41.085
AS I ASKED EARLIER. TO RE

02:27:41.152 --> 02:27:47.124
DIRECT THAT POWER IN AND. AND

02:27:47.191 --> 02:27:47.758
OTHER THINGS PRIVATIZATION THAT

02:27:47.825 --> 02:27:50.962
YOU GO THROUGH IN THAT. SO

02:27:51.028 --> 02:27:51.996
ESSENTIALLY WHEN WE KNOW ARE

02:27:52.063 --> 02:27:53.197
NOTIFIED BY THE UTILITY OF A

02:27:53.264 --> 02:27:54.065
POTENTIAL PSP ASSESSMENT.

02:27:54.131 --> 02:27:54.665
HOPEFULLY WE GET THAT AND AN

02:27:54.732 --> 02:27:55.299
EARLY WARNING OF THAT AND WE

02:27:55.366 --> 02:27:56.500
GET THE DETAILS FROM THE

02:27:56.567 --> 02:27:58.169
UTILITY AS TO EXACTLY WHAT

02:27:58.236 --> 02:28:00.204
LINES THEY'RE ANTICIPATING THAT

02:28:00.271 --> 02:28:00.805
THEY WANT TO GET IT. THEY'RE

02:28:00.871 --> 02:28:03.407
GOING TO DE ENERGIZED. BASED ON

02:28:03.474 --> 02:28:06.844
THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE A LARGE

02:28:06.911 --> 02:28:09.347
TEAM OF ENGINEERS. THAT ARE.

02:28:09.413 --> 02:28:10.514
TIGHTLY CONNECTED TO OUR

02:28:10.581 --> 02:28:12.216
OPERATIONS CENTER AND THEY DO

02:28:12.283 --> 02:28:15.353
EXTENSIVE STUDIES. AS TO ONCE

02:28:15.419 --> 02:28:16.821
THOSE LINES ARE TAKEN OUT WHAT

02:28:16.887 --> 02:28:20.124
ARE THE IMPACTS TO THIS-PARTICULAR AREA. WHAT OTHER

02:28:20.191 --> 02:28:21.692
AREAS OF GENERATION AND

02:28:21.759 --> 02:28:24.428
TRANSMISSION CAN BE UTILIZED TO

02:28:24.495 --> 02:28:27.598
MITIGATE THAT TYPE OF OUTAGE.

02:28:27.665 --> 02:28:28.833
AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. AS A

02:28:28.899 --> 02:28:30.434
GRID OPERATOR WE EXPERIENCED

02:28:30.501 --> 02:28:31.535
TRANSMISSION OUTAGES IN

02:28:31.602 --> 02:28:33.704
GENERATION OUTAGES YOU KNOW AS

02:28:33.771 --> 02:28:35.239
A AS A NORMAL COURSE OF DUTY

02:28:35.306 --> 02:28:38.042
RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE EXTENSIVE

02:28:38.109 --> 02:28:40.745
ABILITY TO STUDY THE SYSTEM.

02:28:40.811 --> 02:28:42.113
AND DETERMINE WHAT THE IMPACTS

02:28:42.179 --> 02:28:46.417
ARE. PART OF OUR ANALYSIS IS WE

02:28:46.484 --> 02:28:49.720
HAVE AN OPTIMIZATION ENGINE.

02:28:49.787 --> 02:28:51.589
THAT CAN FULLY OPTIMIZED TO THE

02:28:51.656 --> 02:28:53.357
GRID TO THE BEST THAT IT THAT

02:28:53.424 --> 02:28:57.228
IT CAN IN TERMS OF. OPTIMAL

02:28:57.295 --> 02:28:57.828
DISPATCH SO ONCE WE GO THROUGH

02:28:57.895 --> 02:29:01.399
THAT STUDY. WE COMMUNICATE WITH

02:29:01.465 --> 02:29:04.135
THE UTILITY AS TO WHAT IS POT

02:29:04.201 --> 02:29:05.736
POSSIBLY RECOMMENDED STEPS

02:29:05.803 --> 02:29:07.672
MOVING FORWARD. AND THAT'S

02:29:07.738 --> 02:29:09.874
WHERE COORDINATION WITH UTILITY

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:12.310
MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN WHAT

02:29:12.376 --> 02:29:14.478
THEY INITIALLY ANTICIPATED AS A

02:29:14.545 --> 02:29:18.349
TRENT TRANSMISSION OUTAGE.

02:29:18.416 --> 02:29:20.284
THERE IS A GOOD THANK YOU. IS

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:23.721
THAT I GUESS WHAT THIS PROBABLY

02:29:23.788 --> 02:29:29.660
GOES TO. THE THREE OF THEM IN

02:29:29.727 --> 02:29:32.129
TERMS OF THE STANDARDS THE

02:29:32.196 --> 02:29:33.497
NGUYEN STANDARDS THAT ARE

02:29:33.564 --> 02:29:34.765
NECESSARY LOOKED AT THE KIND OF

02:29:34.832 --> 02:29:36.734
THE CRITERIA USED FOR THE PSP

02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:37.735
AS A VENDOR LIST OF THE

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:40.404
CRITERIA THAT THAT IS OUTLINED

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:42.640
IN THE WIND THAT I THINK THE

02:29:42.707 --> 02:29:45.509
GENIE IS TALKING ABOUT IS

02:29:45.576 --> 02:29:46.944
TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR

02:29:47.011 --> 02:29:48.045
FORTY FIVE OR SOMETHING IN A IN

02:29:48.112 --> 02:29:49.580
A- GUSTER SOMETHING IS

02:29:49.647 --> 02:29:51.882
DIFFERENT. HOWEVER THESE

02:29:51.949 --> 02:29:54.385
THRESHOLDS SECTION THE MINIMUM

02:29:54.452 --> 02:29:56.087
WINDS SPEEDS STANDARDS FOR

02:29:56.153 --> 02:29:58.856
UTILITY POLES AND OTHERS THE

02:29:58.923 --> 02:30:02.460
GEO NINETY FIVE. RULE THAT

02:30:02.526 --> 02:30:03.561
QUITE A LOT HIGHER THAN THE

02:30:03.627 --> 02:30:04.128
FORTY MILES PER HOUR IN THE

02:30:04.195 --> 02:30:06.430
OTHER UTILITIES DON'T HAVE THAT

02:30:06.497 --> 02:30:09.500
THAT THRESHOLD SO IS IT TO. HOW

02:30:09.567 --> 02:30:12.203
DID YOU DEVELOP THAT STANDARD

02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:13.003
THAT NUMBER ANYWAY THAT WOULD

02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:14.138
THAT WOULD BE YOUR TRIGGER

02:30:14.205 --> 02:30:16.407
POINT. THAT THAT NUMBER WAS

02:30:16.474 --> 02:30:18.442
INTENDED TO BE A GENERAL RULE

02:30:18.509 --> 02:30:20.411
OF THUMB JUST IN TERMS OF

02:30:20.478 --> 02:30:23.180
GUIDANCE AND IT IN MY REMARKS

02:30:23.247 --> 02:30:25.649
SENATOR I HAD TO MENTION THAT

02:30:25.716 --> 02:30:27.818
ONE PLACE THAT WE ARE. WE MADE

02:30:27.885 --> 02:30:31.088
PROGRESS ON IS CORRELATING ARE

02:30:31.155 --> 02:30:33.691
CIRCUITS TO THE PERFORMANCE OF

02:30:33.758 --> 02:30:35.559
WINDS. WHICH MEANS AS WINDS

02:30:35.626 --> 02:30:38.195
PICK UP THERE'S OUTAGES SO WE

02:30:38.262 --> 02:30:41.165
START TO SEE OUR ON OUR SYSTEM

02:30:41.232 --> 02:30:42.366
WHETHER THAT'S EQUIPMENT

02:30:42.433 --> 02:30:43.501
RELATED WHETHER THAT'S

02:30:43.567 --> 02:30:45.136
VEGETATION COMING IN CONTACT.

02:30:45.202 --> 02:30:47.671
WITH THE LINES AND WE'VE DONE

02:30:47.738 --> 02:30:49.774
YOU KNOW THAT ANALYSIS FOR OUR

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:50.975
CIRCUS IN THE HIGH FAR RISK

02:30:51.041 --> 02:30:53.077
AREAS SO WE'RE- LOOKING TO BE

02:30:53.144 --> 02:30:54.044
MORE IN A STRATEGIC AND

02:30:54.111 --> 02:30:56.881
TARGETED. IN TERMS OF WHAT IS

02:30:56.947 --> 02:30:59.583
THAT OF PROBABILITY OF A LOOK

02:30:59.650 --> 02:31:02.186
LIKE OF OUTAGE PRODUCING WIND

02:31:02.253 --> 02:31:03.621
BECAUSE IN THIS CASE WERE

02:31:03.687 --> 02:31:04.955
CORRELATING THE OUTAGE AS A

02:31:05.022 --> 02:31:06.490
LEADING INDICATOR TO A

02:31:06.557 --> 02:31:07.992
POTENTIAL FIRE IGNITION A KEEP

02:31:08.058 --> 02:31:10.528
IN MIND NOT ALL OUTAGES. TURN

02:31:10.594 --> 02:31:12.196
INTO FAR IGNITIONS AYE SHE VERY

02:31:12.263 --> 02:31:14.899
FEW OUTAGES. DO BUT THAT'S NOT

02:31:14.965 --> 02:31:15.833
A BILL THE UNDERLYING KINDA

02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:17.535
MECHANISM AND MODEL THAT WE'VE

02:31:17.601 --> 02:31:19.970
COME UP WITH SO THE TWENTY FIVE

02:31:20.037 --> 02:31:20.604
TO FORTY FIVE WAS INTENDED TO

02:31:20.671 --> 02:31:23.774
BE. JUST MORE OF A DIRECTIONAL

02:31:23.841 --> 02:31:25.276
A TYPE OF A GUIDELINE IF YOU

02:31:25.342 --> 02:31:30.347
WANT TO CALL IT. IT'S NOT

02:31:30.414 --> 02:31:35.453
NECESSARILY. A AN ABSOLUTE.

02:31:35.519 --> 02:31:37.755
OKAY THE AND THAT. THAT'S GOOD

02:31:37.822 --> 02:31:38.889
TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER

02:31:38.956 --> 02:31:39.523
OF FACTORS AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:40.124
SURE YOU'LL YOU'LL BE WORKING

02:31:40.191 --> 02:31:40.758
ON IN TERMS OF THE NEXT PHASE

02:31:40.825 --> 02:31:41.358
OF DEVELOPING THIS IS EXACTLY

02:31:41.425 --> 02:31:42.860
WHAT TOOLS AND WHAT. WHAT WHICH

02:31:42.927 --> 02:31:44.628
STANDARDS THERE SAID IN. AS IT

02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:46.297
MOVES FORWARD SO YOU CAN

02:31:46.363 --> 02:31:48.098
MONITOR THAT A LITTLE MORE AND

02:31:48.165 --> 02:31:49.633
I GUESS WHAT. WHAT I'M LOOKING

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:51.402
AT IS AT THE END. WHEN THERE IS

02:31:51.469 --> 02:31:53.270
AN EVENT AND YOU REVIEW THOSE

02:31:53.337 --> 02:31:54.338
EVENTS THEY HAVE A P. S. P. S.

02:31:54.405 --> 02:31:59.376
CALLED POWERS OFF THE RE ENGAGE

02:31:59.443 --> 02:32:01.345
REENERGIZE THEN YOU REVIEW

02:32:01.412 --> 02:32:03.881
THOSE AFTER THE REPORTS COME IN.

02:32:03.948 --> 02:32:05.716
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO LEARN

02:32:05.783 --> 02:32:07.184
FROM THOSE AND HOW DO YOU

02:32:07.251 --> 02:32:10.888
EXPECT THAT TO GUIDE FUTURE.

02:32:10.955 --> 02:32:11.989
EITHER REGULATIONS OR

02:32:12.056 --> 02:32:13.657
REQUIREMENTS AND I GUESS WHAT

02:32:13.724 --> 02:32:15.125
I'M TRYING TO USE IT SO WE CAN

02:32:15.192 --> 02:32:16.760
GET THAT METRIC DOWN TO

02:32:16.827 --> 02:32:19.063
SOMETHING THAT IS CONTROLLABLE

02:32:19.129 --> 02:32:21.232
AND REFINED ENOUGH SO WE CAN

02:32:21.298 --> 02:32:23.167
AVOID THE PS PS OF INCHES WE

02:32:23.234 --> 02:32:25.002
HAVE AT THE END OF THE DAY

02:32:25.069 --> 02:32:27.037
WHICH I KNOW THIS IS JUST THAT.

02:32:27.104 --> 02:32:30.241
I'M HOPING A TEMPORARY. THE PS

02:32:30.307 --> 02:32:33.377
PS OF ENTERED ARE ARE JUST.

02:32:33.444 --> 02:32:34.712
TEMPORARY THAT WE WILL HAVE A

02:32:34.778 --> 02:32:37.581
RESILIENT SYSTEM ROBUST SYSTEM

02:32:37.648 --> 02:32:39.149
AND NOT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO

02:32:39.216 --> 02:32:40.084
WORRY ABOUT SHARING THE POWER

02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:41.619
OFF BECAUSE WE KNOW TO

02:32:41.685 --> 02:32:42.186
WITHSTAND THAT IS THAT WITH

02:32:42.253 --> 02:32:47.324
THE- END GOAL IS. WELL I AM THE

02:32:47.391 --> 02:32:50.160
WITH THE- UTILITIES ARE

02:32:50.227 --> 02:32:52.863
DEVELOPING THEIR HOME HIS PEERS

02:32:52.930 --> 02:32:54.164
PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW IS A THEIR

02:32:54.231 --> 02:32:55.866
DEPENDENCE ON THE FINANCE WITH

02:32:55.933 --> 02:32:57.635
THE FINANCIAL INDEX THAT EACH

02:32:57.701 --> 02:33:00.137
COMPANY IS DEVELOPING FOR THEIR

02:33:00.204 --> 02:33:01.505
TERRITORY AND NOT INDEXED

02:33:01.572 --> 02:33:04.275
SEEKS. OUT SEVERAL FACTORS INTO

02:33:04.341 --> 02:33:06.443
CONSIDERATION WIND BEING ONE OF

02:33:06.510 --> 02:33:07.411
THEM BUT SOME CHRISTIAN

02:33:07.478 --> 02:33:08.913
RELATIVE HUMIDITY OF

02:33:08.979 --> 02:33:11.348
INVIOLABILITY OF FUEL. OR OTHER

02:33:11.415 --> 02:33:13.183
CRITICAL FACTORS THAT THEY'RE

02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:14.718
ALL LOOKING AT THE AS WELL AS

02:33:14.785 --> 02:33:18.289
HISTORIC CIRCUIT PERFORMANCE.

02:33:18.355 --> 02:33:21.292
EACH UTILITY IS. DEVELOPING

02:33:21.358 --> 02:33:23.027
THEIR OWN THAT SEEKING THE FROM

02:33:23.093 --> 02:33:25.796
FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION AND-

02:33:25.863 --> 02:33:27.331
THOSE INDEXES ARE BECOMING MORE

02:33:27.398 --> 02:33:29.433
AND MORE COMPLEX. AND THE WAY

02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:31.735
THAT THEIR OPERATIONALIZE IN

02:33:31.802 --> 02:33:32.903
THEIR PROCESS SEES IS THAT IF

02:33:32.970 --> 02:33:35.239
THE SPECIFIC. IN THE YOU KNOW

02:33:35.306 --> 02:33:37.107
IF INDEX REACHES A CERTAIN

02:33:37.174 --> 02:33:38.709
THRESHOLD THAT'S WHEN THE

02:33:38.776 --> 02:33:41.011
UTILITY ACTIVATES INTO THEIR PS

02:33:41.078 --> 02:33:43.747
PS WATCH. AND TELL THEM YOU

02:33:43.814 --> 02:33:44.715
KNOW AND THEN WE GO FORWARD

02:33:44.782 --> 02:33:47.217
FROM THERE SO THE THING

02:33:47.284 --> 02:33:49.486
COMMUTER THE ONE THE ONE AREA

02:33:49.553 --> 02:33:51.155
FOR THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO

02:33:51.221 --> 02:33:53.624
ENGAGE IN IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW

02:33:53.691 --> 02:33:55.326
THE UTILITIES ARE DEVELOPING

02:33:55.392 --> 02:33:58.562
THESE. L. INDICES AND HOW THE

02:33:58.629 --> 02:34:00.097
TIE WITH THE STATE'S

02:34:00.164 --> 02:34:01.432
ASSESSMENTS OF FIRE THREATS

02:34:01.498 --> 02:34:02.800
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ONE IN THE

02:34:02.866 --> 02:34:04.868
SAME AND ONE CAN BE USED TO

02:34:04.935 --> 02:34:06.837
INFORM THE OTHER AND THERE'S

02:34:06.904 --> 02:34:08.806
INTO DEPENDENCY IS THERE. BUT

02:34:08.872 --> 02:34:10.908
IN ORDER FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM

02:34:10.975 --> 02:34:12.042
TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY WE'RE

02:34:12.109 --> 02:34:13.644
GOING TO NEED TO RECONCILE THE

02:34:13.711 --> 02:34:15.779
UTILITY FIRE THREAT POTENTIAL

02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:16.914
INDEXES WITH THE OVER ALL

02:34:16.981 --> 02:34:18.248
THREAT ASSESSMENT IS THE STATE.

02:34:18.315 --> 02:34:28.225
SO THAT'S- A THINK IS GOING. TO

02:34:28.292 --> 02:34:34.531
TAKE SOME TIME AND ILL. YOU

02:34:34.598 --> 02:34:35.332
KNEW WHAT IT YOU KNOW

02:34:35.399 --> 02:34:35.966
ADDITIONAL CAN FACTOR HERE IS

02:34:36.033 --> 02:34:37.267
THAT THE YOU KNOW IT WHEN IT

02:34:37.334 --> 02:34:39.169
COMES TO WIND IT'S NOT SO MUCH

02:34:39.236 --> 02:34:42.072
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR POLLS TO

02:34:42.139 --> 02:34:42.606
WITHSTAND THE CERTAIN WIND

02:34:42.673 --> 02:34:46.176
FACTOR I MEAN ONE. THE FIRST

02:34:46.243 --> 02:34:47.077
POINT IS FULL OF THE MOST THE

02:34:47.144 --> 02:34:48.312
L. ROBUST PIECE OF THE

02:34:48.379 --> 02:34:50.314
INFRASTRUCTURE POOL FAILURES

02:34:50.381 --> 02:34:53.050
ARE THE- LOWEST. YOU KNOW OUT

02:34:53.117 --> 02:34:54.151
OF ALL THE STATISTICS OF FIRING

02:34:54.218 --> 02:34:55.719
CONNECTIONS THAT'S THE BILL ONE

02:34:55.786 --> 02:34:56.520
OF THE WILL WAS BECAUSE IT IS

02:34:56.587 --> 02:34:57.921
AND I MEAN IT. DOES LITTLE AT

02:34:57.988 --> 02:34:58.489
LEAST LIKE A PIECE OF

02:34:58.555 --> 02:34:59.657
INFRASTRUCTURE TO FAIL ELLEN

02:34:59.723 --> 02:35:01.191
THE CONDUCTOR IS MUCH MORE

02:35:01.258 --> 02:35:02.292
LIKELY TO FAILED ON THE POLE.

02:35:02.359 --> 02:35:03.894
OWN AND YOU KNOW BUT EVEN MORE

02:35:03.961 --> 02:35:04.495
SO WHAT YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING

02:35:04.561 --> 02:35:05.396
AT IS A VEGETATION FAILURE AND

02:35:05.462 --> 02:35:06.764
THAT'S THE THAT'S THE TOUGH

02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:08.365
PART YOU KNOW YOU CAN DESIGN

02:35:08.432 --> 02:35:09.733
THE INFRASTRUCTURE SUIT TO

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:10.501
WITHSTAND A CERTAIN NGUYEN

02:35:10.567 --> 02:35:12.970
FACTOR BUT- EL YOU CAN EVEN

02:35:13.037 --> 02:35:13.804
KEEP INCREASING THE CONDUCT THE

02:35:13.871 --> 02:35:16.106
STRENGTH. BUT IF YOU KNOW YOU

02:35:16.173 --> 02:35:18.842
HOME YOU KNOW WITH WINS OVER

02:35:18.909 --> 02:35:20.944
YOU KNOW THIRTY FIVE MILES PER

02:35:21.011 --> 02:35:22.746
HOUR GUSTS YOU STARTING TO HOLD

02:35:22.813 --> 02:35:24.014
THE TREES AND VEGETATION

02:35:24.081 --> 02:35:25.916
FAILING THAT FLIES ON THE WIND

02:35:25.983 --> 02:35:27.151
UNTIL IT HIT SOMETHING. AND

02:35:27.217 --> 02:35:29.086
THAT SOMETHING CAN BE A AND

02:35:29.153 --> 02:35:31.155
ENERGIZED CONDUCTOR SO HELD THE

02:35:31.221 --> 02:35:32.556
YOU KNOW SO THAT UNITS THAT'S

02:35:32.623 --> 02:35:34.191
PART OF THE REASON WHY THE

02:35:34.258 --> 02:35:35.526
WINDOWS IN THE PORN FACTOR HERE

02:35:35.592 --> 02:35:38.462
IN JUST ABOUT DESIGNING. THE

02:35:38.529 --> 02:35:40.631
UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO

02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:42.599
WITHSTAND CERTAIN WINS ISN'T

02:35:42.666 --> 02:35:44.435
QUITE ENOUGH IN ITSELF TO

02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:47.004
REDUCE. THE RISK DOWN IN THIS

02:35:47.071 --> 02:35:47.771
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN BE

02:35:47.838 --> 02:35:51.642
DONE. ALL IN THAT RESPECT BUT

02:35:51.709 --> 02:35:52.309
GOING BACK TO THE SCHOOL

02:35:52.376 --> 02:35:59.083
QUESTION. ELTON. WHEN THE

02:35:59.149 --> 02:36:00.584
UTILITIES DE ENERGIZE IN DOING

02:36:00.651 --> 02:36:02.252
THE ASSESSMENTS AFTER THE FACT

02:36:02.319 --> 02:36:04.455
IN THIS ONE ELEMENTS ALL OF YOU

02:36:04.521 --> 02:36:05.856
KNOW UNDERSTANDING HOW THE

02:36:05.923 --> 02:36:07.691
UTILITIES DECISION MAKING

02:36:07.758 --> 02:36:09.326
PROCESS AND FACTORS LIKE WIND

02:36:09.393 --> 02:36:10.327
IN THE FIGHT FOR A POTENTIAL

02:36:10.394 --> 02:36:11.995
INDEX THAT GO INTO IT WITH THE

02:36:12.062 --> 02:36:13.697
OTHER ONE IS THE RISK TOLERANCE

02:36:13.764 --> 02:36:14.998
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

02:36:15.065 --> 02:36:19.169
CAN GOING BACK TO AND ALL THE

02:36:19.236 --> 02:36:21.371
YOU KNOW WHETHER ALL OF ITS

02:36:21.438 --> 02:36:24.308
FINANCIAL OR SAFETY YOU KNOW

02:36:24.374 --> 02:36:26.009
THE EVERY AND CITY HAS A

02:36:26.076 --> 02:36:28.545
DIFFERENT RISK TOLERANCE I MEAN

02:36:28.612 --> 02:36:29.847
THAT'S JUST THE NATURE ALL OF

02:36:29.913 --> 02:36:32.583
PALM WITH RESTORE INCE'S ARE

02:36:32.649 --> 02:36:34.952
THERE SPECIFIC TO THE AND CITY.

02:36:35.018 --> 02:36:37.287
OF AN IN EVERYBODY'S RISK

02:36:37.354 --> 02:36:38.655
ASSESSMENT THIS DIFFERENCE SO

02:36:38.722 --> 02:36:40.657
UTILITY LAKE AS THE GENIE FOR

02:36:40.724 --> 02:36:42.059
EXAMPLE CAN SAID THE RISK

02:36:42.126 --> 02:36:44.328
TOLERANCE TO BE ZERO ZERO

02:36:44.394 --> 02:36:46.063
IGNITION SO FIRES FROM OUR

02:36:46.130 --> 02:36:48.532
INFRASTRUCTURE ALL YOU KNOW

02:36:48.599 --> 02:36:50.134
THAT CAN BE THE RISK TOLERANCE

02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:52.336
OF THE OTHER UTILITIES THAT FOR

02:36:52.402 --> 02:36:53.303
WHATEVER REASON MAYBE THAT'S

02:36:53.370 --> 02:36:55.272
THEIR ASSESSMENTS OF WHAT'S

02:36:55.339 --> 02:36:57.307
BEST FOR THE PUBLIC MAYBE

02:36:57.374 --> 02:36:59.810
THEY'D SEEKING YEAR THE L.

02:36:59.877 --> 02:37:02.312
THERE THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY

02:37:02.379 --> 02:37:04.448
OF THE COMPANY ISN'T SO COUNTS

02:37:04.515 --> 02:37:05.082
WITH WHATEVER THAT IS THEY SAID

02:37:05.149 --> 02:37:07.017
THEY WERE A RISK TOLERANCE.

02:37:07.084 --> 02:37:08.085
HOURS RISK TOLERANCE MADE THE

02:37:08.152 --> 02:37:09.052
DIFFERENCE IN THE MAY BE

02:37:09.119 --> 02:37:17.761
DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON. THE

02:37:17.828 --> 02:37:24.368
STATE AGENCY OR ALL. A SPECIFIC

02:37:24.434 --> 02:37:27.538
JURISDICTION RATE ELM IN MAYBE

02:37:27.604 --> 02:37:28.839
IN SOME CASES AS THE STATE'S WE

02:37:28.906 --> 02:37:30.641
COULD TOLERATE A UTILITY

02:37:30.707 --> 02:37:32.376
IGNITION OF A FIRE. IF THE

02:37:32.442 --> 02:37:34.211
DAMAGES BELOW A CERTAIN

02:37:34.278 --> 02:37:37.347
THRESHOLD NOW HOLLOW DO WE DEAL

02:37:37.414 --> 02:37:38.649
WITH THAT RATE IF WE HOW OF

02:37:38.715 --> 02:37:40.851
THESE DIFFERENT RISK TOLERANCES

02:37:40.918 --> 02:37:42.419
IN THE UTILITY BASED ON THAT

02:37:42.486 --> 02:37:44.121
RISK TOLERANCE IS ONCE. WITH

02:37:44.188 --> 02:37:44.955
THE AT THE SITES TO THE

02:37:45.022 --> 02:37:46.290
ENERGIZED THEIR LINES IF

02:37:46.356 --> 02:37:47.157
THERE'S A RISK OF ANY A

02:37:47.224 --> 02:37:48.792
CONNECTION. ALL HOW DO WE AS

02:37:48.859 --> 02:37:50.327
THE REGULATOR THEN THE SIDE

02:37:50.394 --> 02:37:51.895
WITH THE DOT WAS AN ACCEPTABLE

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:53.964
DECISIONS TO MAKE RIGHT NOW ALL

02:37:54.031 --> 02:37:55.666
KIND OF SITTING. IN THE IN THE

02:37:55.732 --> 02:37:56.466
I OWN A CHAIR ON THE ON THE

02:37:56.533 --> 02:37:56.967
RECEIVING SIDE THAN THE

02:37:57.034 --> 02:37:58.402
REGULATORY ROLE I DON'T KNOW

02:37:58.468 --> 02:37:59.803
HOW TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT. OF

02:37:59.870 --> 02:38:01.004
WHETHER THEIR DECISION TO THE

02:38:01.071 --> 02:38:01.638
ENERGIZED BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT

02:38:01.705 --> 02:38:02.739
THERE MIGHT BE A RISK OF

02:38:02.806 --> 02:38:04.308
IGNITION AND MAY BE A LOSS OF

02:38:04.374 --> 02:38:05.576
ONE PROPERTY WOULD NOT HAVE

02:38:05.642 --> 02:38:07.411
BEEN THE DEVASTATING. YELP WILD

02:38:07.477 --> 02:38:09.213
FIRE BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS TO

02:38:09.279 --> 02:38:10.414
MAKE IT. SPREAD THROUGH THE

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:11.915
ENTIRE TERRITORY WERE THERE BUT

02:38:11.982 --> 02:38:13.383
THERE WAS A LEGITIMATE RISK OF

02:38:13.450 --> 02:38:14.818
AN IGNITION IS THAT THE CLIP

02:38:14.885 --> 02:38:16.954
DOUBLE OR NOT. I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:18.422
TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THAT

02:38:18.488 --> 02:38:20.190
RIGHT I DON'T THINK THAT ANSWER

02:38:20.257 --> 02:38:22.693
EXISTS AND SO SOMETHING WILL

02:38:22.759 --> 02:38:24.461
NEED TO HOP IN AS WE MOVE

02:38:24.528 --> 02:38:27.264
FORWARD HERE. TO ENGAGE FURTHER

02:38:27.331 --> 02:38:28.899
IN THAT CONVERSATION IN THE

02:38:28.966 --> 02:38:31.335
SEAT WITH THE WE ALL. YOU KNOW

02:38:31.401 --> 02:38:35.439
ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A E. L.

02:38:35.505 --> 02:38:43.580
HE IS A STATE. COMMUNICATE WHAT

02:38:43.647 --> 02:38:49.686
THAT RISK TOLERANCE. IS WITH

SENATOR WINTERS COMMENTS

02:43:26.396 --> 02:43:28.064
EARLIER. IT COMES AT A GREAT

02:43:28.131 --> 02:43:29.399
COST FROM AN EMPLOYMENT

02:43:29.466 --> 02:43:32.102
STANDPOINT LOSS OF PRODUCT

02:43:32.169 --> 02:43:32.869
ANECDOTALLYI CAN SHARE THAT

02:43:32.936 --> 02:43:34.971
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO.

02:43:35.038 --> 02:43:36.706
MY PREVIOUS EMPLOYER LOS FORTY

02:43:36.773 --> 02:43:38.842
THOUSAND GALLONS OF BEER AT A

02:43:38.909 --> 02:43:39.442
BREWERY IN LOS ANGELES BECAUSE

02:43:39.509 --> 02:43:43.580
THE POWER WENT OUT. YEAH THAT

02:43:43.647 --> 02:43:45.615
SOUNDS GOOD WELL TOO BAD BUT

02:43:45.682 --> 02:43:47.350
IT'S A PERISHABLE PRODUCT IS A

02:43:47.417 --> 02:43:49.920
PROCESS THE AND- DID COST A

02:43:49.986 --> 02:43:50.854
GREAT DEAL OF MONEY FOR THAT

02:43:50.921 --> 02:43:52.322
BREWER. SO HOW WE MANAGE THAT

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:53.857
AND I'M JUST USING THESE AS YOU

02:43:53.924 --> 02:43:56.026
KNOW RATIONALE TO PUSH BACK UP

02:43:56.092 --> 02:43:56.793
WHERE WE GO THERE'S A

02:43:56.860 --> 02:43:58.028
TREMENDOUS LIABILITY. THAT WE

02:43:58.094 --> 02:44:00.063
FACE WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT.

02:44:00.130 --> 02:44:00.630
AND I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE

02:44:00.697 --> 02:44:02.265
MANUFACTURER THAT DECIDED TO

02:44:02.332 --> 02:44:04.534
COME TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE

02:44:04.601 --> 02:44:05.135
POWER MIGHT BE ON MOST OF THE

02:44:05.202 --> 02:44:10.707
TIME. AND THEY EXPECT THE POWER

02:44:10.774 --> 02:44:11.241
TO BE ON ALL OF THE TIME.

02:44:11.308 --> 02:44:12.509
BARRING A NATURAL CATASTROPHE.

02:44:12.576 --> 02:44:13.243
AB QUAKERS ARE SOME OF HE

02:44:13.310 --> 02:44:14.377
MAGNITUDE. TO THE EXTENT WE

02:44:14.444 --> 02:44:16.546
HAVE CONTROL OVER THE OUTAGE

02:44:16.613 --> 02:44:17.914
LET'S REALLY FOCUS OUR EFFORT

02:44:17.981 --> 02:44:20.917
ENERGY. IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE

02:44:20.984 --> 02:44:21.518
I THINK IT'LL BE VERY HELPFUL

02:44:21.585 --> 02:44:24.154
FOR US. THE AND SOME OF THE

02:44:24.221 --> 02:44:25.889

VIRTUALLY HAD ALMOST NO NOTICE.

02:44:33.263 --> 02:44:34.531
TO TURN OFF YOUR FACTORY IN IF

02:44:34.598 --> 02:44:37.667
YOU HAVE PRODUCT IN. THE PIPES

02:44:37.734 --> 02:44:38.368
BEING PREPARED YOU'RE GONNA

02:44:38.435 --> 02:44:39.236
LOSE THAT YOU LOSE THE

02:44:39.302 --> 02:44:42.138

REFINERIES FLARING WAS ALSO

02:44:43.273 --> 02:44:45.742
MADE EARLIER. IT IT'S HARD IN

02:44:45.809 --> 02:44:49.746
THE ABSTRACT. FOR I THINK THE

02:44:49.813 --> 02:44:50.347
PUBLIC CERTAINLY TO GRASP AND

02:44:50.413 --> 02:44:54.818
MAYBE SOMETIMES. AND THOSE OF

US HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IS A

02:44:55.952 --> 02:44:56.786
REALLY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THAT

02:44:56.853 --> 02:44:57.687
COULD HAPPEN. AND WOULD RATHER

TRYING TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO

02:45:15.872 --> 02:45:18.275
AVOID TO ALL EXTENT POSSIBLE.

02:45:18.341 --> 02:45:19.643

IS GONNA BE AT AN ONGOING

02:45:26.516 --> 02:45:27.951
DISCUSSION. THE END OF A WRAP

pWHO UNITED CONVERSATION EARLIER

02:45:30.587 --> 02:45:34.691
IN THE WEEK. THAT THIS HEARING.

02:45:34.758 --> 02:45:35.292
SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN NEXT

02:45:35.358 --> 02:45:39.329
YEAR. THIS IS A ONE TIME

02:45:39.396 --> 02:45:40.664
HEARING CLOSE GET THE ISSUES ON

02:45:40.730 --> 02:45:41.231
THE TABLE. PERHAPS FOCUS ON

02:45:41.298 --> 02:45:42.198
SOME REALLY. MEANINGFUL

02:45:42.265 --> 02:45:43.533
SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE ACTED

02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:44.701
UPON AS SOON AS THIS

02:45:44.768 --> 02:45:46.136
LEGISLATURE CAN ACT. SO THE

02:45:46.202 --> 02:45:47.270
NEXT YEAR IF THERE IS A HEARING

02:45:47.337 --> 02:45:47.871
YOU TO BE WELL WE DID A GREAT

02:45:47.937 --> 02:45:49.706
JOB. WE HAVEN'T HAD A SHUT DOWN

02:45:49.773 --> 02:45:52.075
AS A RESULT OF WILDFIRE. THE

02:45:52.142 --> 02:45:53.143
END THE FACT IT WOULD THE

02:45:53.209 --> 02:45:54.210
PREVIOUS PANEL DID CONCLUDE THE

02:45:54.277 --> 02:45:55.712
WAY THEY DID IF THAT'S THE

02:45:55.779 --> 02:45:57.180
PROBLEM AND I'M I'M NOT HERE TO

02:45:57.247 --> 02:45:58.315
SAY THAT IT IS. BUT IF THAT'S

02:45:58.381 --> 02:46:00.150
THE PROBLEM. LET'S WORK WITH

02:46:00.216 --> 02:46:01.751
UTILITIES AND FIND IF IT'S ONE

02:46:01.818 --> 02:46:04.120
PARTICULAR VULNERABLE VALLEY IN

02:46:04.187 --> 02:46:05.455
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ONE

02:46:05.522 --> 02:46:07.857
VULNERABLE VALLEY IN SOUTHERN

02:46:07.924 --> 02:46:12.095
CALIFORNIA. LET'S FIX IT. AND

02:46:12.162 --> 02:46:13.863
THE ISSUE OF HAVING. READY

02:46:13.930 --> 02:46:14.931
POWER AVAILABLE. IF THE PART IS

02:46:14.998 --> 02:46:16.333
GONNA GO OUT TO HAVE GENERATION

02:46:16.399 --> 02:46:18.034
AVAILABLE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT

02:46:18.101 --> 02:46:18.601
IF THE LAWS ALLOWED US TO DO

02:46:18.668 --> 02:46:22.439
THAT. BECAUSE WE BUILD ALL

02:46:22.505 --> 02:46:23.840
KINDS OF BACK UP OPPORTUNITIES

02:46:23.907 --> 02:46:25.241
BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT.

02:46:25.308 --> 02:46:26.743
THAT LUXURY IN MOST CASES THE

02:46:26.810 --> 02:46:28.278
HARMONIZATION OF THE LAWS AND

02:46:28.345 --> 02:46:30.547
REGULATIONS TO DO THAT. IS ALL

02:46:30.613 --> 02:46:33.316
MAKE THE POINT THAT IT'S THE

02:46:33.383 --> 02:46:34.818
IMPACT IS FAR GREATER TO HAVE A

02:46:34.884 --> 02:46:36.786
SHUT DOWN FOR US IN OUR CASE A

02:46:36.853 --> 02:46:40.123
MINIMUM FOUR DAYS. TO KEEP THAT

02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:41.558
FACILITY RUNNING AND KEEP

02:46:41.624 --> 02:46:43.059
EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED THAT WOULD

02:46:43.126 --> 02:46:44.461
BE TO HAVE THAT BACK A

02:46:44.527 --> 02:46:46.496
GENERATION OF WHATEVER SOURCE.

02:46:46.563 --> 02:46:48.565
IDEALLY THE LEAST POLLUTING AS

02:46:48.631 --> 02:46:49.933
POSSIBLE TO KICK IN AND KEEP

02:46:49.999 --> 02:46:51.668
THE PROCESS GOING. SO IT IS

02:46:51.735 --> 02:46:52.969
PART OF YOUR SOLUTION PLEASE

02:46:53.036 --> 02:46:54.604
CONSIDER THOSE THINGS TO GIVE

02:46:54.671 --> 02:46:56.339
US THE OPTIONS. THE AND I WILL

02:46:56.406 --> 02:46:57.741
CONCLUDE WITH THE OF THE NOTION

02:46:57.807 --> 02:46:59.542
THAT ON THE BACKGROUND MATERIAL

02:46:59.609 --> 02:47:00.643
SAYS WITH GREAT POWER COMES

02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:02.078
GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. AND I

02:47:02.145 --> 02:47:04.214
LIKE TO DO A LITTLE REFORM THAT

02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:04.748
TO SAY WITH RELIABLE POWER

02:47:04.814 --> 02:47:07.817
COMES GREAT OPPORTUNITY. AND

02:47:07.884 --> 02:47:08.618
THAT WOULD GIVE US NOT. THE

02:47:08.685 --> 02:47:09.819
ABILITY TO GROW BUSINESS IN

02:47:09.886 --> 02:47:11.621
CALIFORNIA TO HELP. GROW THE

02:47:11.688 --> 02:47:13.390
ECONOMY AND BE LIKENED. TO CALL

02:47:13.456 --> 02:47:14.524
OURSELVES THE FIFTH LARGEST

02:47:14.591 --> 02:47:16.926
ECONOMY WHEN WE'RE HAVING A

02:47:16.993 --> 02:47:17.527
HEARING LIKE THIS IS A LITTLE

02:47:17.594 --> 02:47:20.029
BIT OF A PARADOX. IT'S HARD FOR

02:47:20.096 --> 02:47:22.065
US TO SAY THAT. WITH A STRAIGHT

02:47:22.132 --> 02:47:24.300
FACE OVER TALK ABOUT TURN OFF

02:47:24.367 --> 02:47:26.870
OF THE POWER SO. GOOD WITH THAT

02:47:26.936 --> 02:47:27.871
ALL DAHLE PROCEDURE THERE

02:47:27.937 --> 02:47:30.907
LATELY. STOCK ONE QUESTION IF

02:47:30.974 --> 02:47:33.109
YOU DO MANY OF YOUR FACILITIES.

02:47:33.176 --> 02:47:34.911
HAVE COGENERATION OPPORTUNITIES

02:47:34.978 --> 02:47:36.413
TO THEY HAVE FACILITIES ON SITE

02:47:36.479 --> 02:47:39.215
AND IF THEY DON'T ARE THOSE.

02:47:39.282 --> 02:47:40.717
BEING PLANNED NOW I BELIEVE YOU

02:47:40.784 --> 02:47:41.518
CAN BETTER BE A PLANS NOW

02:47:41.584 --> 02:47:42.385
BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION THE

02:47:42.452 --> 02:47:43.553
THREAT THAT WE FACE. THE

02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:46.022
REACTION TO THE BURGER WAS THEY

02:47:46.089 --> 02:47:47.023
PUT INTO FIVE MEGAWATT GAS

02:47:47.090 --> 02:47:48.625
FIRED TURBINES IMMEDIATELY. AT

02:47:48.691 --> 02:47:50.126
TO AVOID THAT PROBLEM IN THE

02:47:50.193 --> 02:47:52.128
FUTURE. BUT THAT'S NOT A

02:47:52.195 --> 02:47:53.563
PROCESS YOU CAN JUST GO IS BUT

02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:55.331
WAS MENTIONED BEFORE HOME DEPOT

02:47:55.398 --> 02:47:57.133
AND BUY ONE. AND PUT IT IN AND

02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:59.002
GET GOING CITY DOES TAKE A LOT

02:47:59.068 --> 02:48:00.303
OF PLANNING YEAH WE THINK

02:48:00.370 --> 02:48:01.237
THERE'S JUST AS MUCH PLAN THAT

02:48:01.304 --> 02:48:02.906
COULD BE DONE IN MANAGING. THE

02:48:02.972 --> 02:48:04.674
THREAT ON THE ENDS THAT YOU

02:48:04.741 --> 02:48:06.042
JUST HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS

02:48:06.109 --> 02:48:07.377
PANEL SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO

02:48:07.444 --> 02:48:08.445
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND THAT

02:48:08.511 --> 02:48:13.183
WOULD BE AN IDEAL SITUATION.

02:48:13.249 --> 02:48:13.683

THE INVITATION. TO THE

02:48:23.226 --> 02:48:24.093
CALIFORNIA SO IN STORE

02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:24.894
DISSOCIATION TO BE HERE AND

02:48:24.961 --> 02:48:25.829
REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE

02:48:25.895 --> 02:48:26.396
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE

02:48:26.463 --> 02:48:28.865
COMMUNITY. YEAH I WAS A IT

02:48:28.932 --> 02:48:30.099
REALLY BROUGHT HOME TO ME JUST

02:48:30.166 --> 02:48:31.367
HOW TRAGIC THE CONSEQUENCES CAN

02:48:31.434 --> 02:48:33.636
BE WHEN MISTER HASTINGS

02:48:33.703 --> 02:48:34.938
MENTIONED THAT FORTY THOUSAND

02:48:35.004 --> 02:48:36.773
GALLONS OF BEER LOST MY MIND I

02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:40.276
IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED THAT TO.

02:48:40.343 --> 02:48:40.877
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND

02:48:40.944 --> 02:48:42.345
PINTS WHICH YOU KNOW REALLY

02:48:42.412 --> 02:48:44.714
MAKES MORE PALPABLE. NOW I MEAN

02:48:44.781 --> 02:48:45.949
WE REALLY CAN'T STAND YET HAVE

02:48:46.015 --> 02:48:50.353
SUFFERED MORE LOSSES LIKE THAT.

02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:50.854
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:54.157
STUDENT RESOURCES CAN HELP. IT

02:48:54.224 --> 02:48:54.757
IN FACT YOU MENTIONED COMBINED

02:48:54.824 --> 02:48:57.594
HEAT AND POWER. IN THE STATE IS

02:48:57.660 --> 02:48:58.194
REALLY BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM

02:48:58.261 --> 02:49:00.763
COMBINED HEAT AND POWER. IN

02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:01.364
PART BECAUSE OF OUR DESIRE D.

02:49:01.431 --> 02:49:06.069
CARBONIZED THE GRID. SO POLICY

02:49:06.135 --> 02:49:07.604
ACTIONS TAKEN THE PC OVER THE

02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:08.204
LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF PHILLY.

02:49:08.271 --> 02:49:10.607
BEEN GEARED MORE TOWARDS

02:49:10.673 --> 02:49:14.043
RAMPING DOWN THE AMOUNT OF.

02:49:14.110 --> 02:49:14.644
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE IN THE

02:49:14.711 --> 02:49:17.814
STATE OVERTIME. THE BACKGROUND

02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:19.048
DOCUMENT THAT WAS PREPARED VIEW.

02:49:19.115 --> 02:49:22.785
FRAMES. THE DECISION MAKING

02:49:22.852 --> 02:49:24.921
PROCESS FORGET GRID OPERATORS

02:49:24.988 --> 02:49:26.122
AND FOR THE FOR THE REGULATORS

02:49:26.189 --> 02:49:28.458
THAT OVERSEE THEM AS A DILEMMA

02:49:28.525 --> 02:49:30.293
BECAUSE ON ONE SIDE YOU HAVE

02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:30.827
THE CERTAINTY THAT TAKING

02:49:30.894 --> 02:49:34.264
ACTION. TO INITIATE A POWER

02:49:34.330 --> 02:49:36.032
SHUT OFF WILL CAUSE SOME HARM

02:49:36.099 --> 02:49:38.268
AND THAT COULD BE FINANCIAL. IT

02:49:38.334 --> 02:49:40.603
COULD BE SAFETY RELATED OR EVEN

02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:43.006
JUST PSYCHOLOGICAL THE-

02:49:43.072 --> 02:49:44.641
INCONVENIENCE IN THE

02:49:44.707 --> 02:49:45.275
AGGRAVATION OF HAVING A PARTIAL

02:49:45.341 --> 02:49:48.678
FOR DAYS AT A TIME. THAT'S

02:49:48.745 --> 02:49:50.113
1100% CERTAINTY THE PROBABILITY

02:49:50.179 --> 02:49:50.747
IS ONE THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN IF

02:49:50.813 --> 02:49:53.416
YOU EXECUTE IT. ON THE OTHER

02:49:53.483 --> 02:49:55.518
HAND YOU HAVE THE UNCERTAINTY

02:49:55.585 --> 02:49:56.886
OF WHETHER YOU MAY OR MAY NOT

02:49:56.953 --> 02:49:58.788
HAVE AVOIDED A FIRE AND IF SO

02:49:58.855 --> 02:49:59.389
WHAT WHAT WOULD THE MAGNITUDE

02:49:59.455 --> 02:50:02.191
OF THAT FAR HAVE BEEN. SO YOU

02:50:02.258 --> 02:50:02.892
CAN THINK OF IT AS-

02:50:02.959 --> 02:50:05.628
ESSENTIALLY. OF ESTIMATING THE

02:50:05.695 --> 02:50:06.796
CONSEQUENCES OF ACTION VERSES

02:50:06.863 --> 02:50:08.998
IN ACTION. SO THE HIGHER THE

02:50:09.065 --> 02:50:11.501
LEVEL OF THE COST. OF A- OF A

02:50:11.568 --> 02:50:13.369
POWER SHUT OFF. THE MORE

02:50:13.436 --> 02:50:15.638
RELUCTANT UTILITIES WILL BE TO

02:50:15.705 --> 02:50:16.139
EXECUTE THEM BECAUSE THE

02:50:16.205 --> 02:50:18.675
BOUNCING BACK COST VERSUS.

02:50:18.741 --> 02:50:19.275
THEIR THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE

02:50:19.342 --> 02:50:24.180
FIRE RISK. SO WE BELIEVE THAT

02:50:24.247 --> 02:50:25.214
THERE ARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

02:50:25.281 --> 02:50:27.984
WE CAN HELP TO REDUCE THE

02:50:28.051 --> 02:50:28.651
IMPACT OF POWER SHUT OFF BY

02:50:28.718 --> 02:50:31.888
MAINTAINING POWER AND THAT

02:50:31.955 --> 02:50:32.455
COULD BE EITHER FOR TARGETED

02:50:32.522 --> 02:50:32.956
CUSTOMERS ARE FOR ENTIRE

02:50:33.022 --> 02:50:34.724
COMMUNITIES. PAGES FOUR AND

02:50:34.791 --> 02:50:37.860
FIVE OF THE BACKGROUND DOCUMENT.

02:50:37.927 --> 02:50:40.330
LIST SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF THE

02:50:40.396 --> 02:50:42.765
KINDS OF SOCIETAL COSTS AND

02:50:42.832 --> 02:50:43.399
SAFETY RELATED RISK THE PARTIAL

STORAGE CONTRACT THE ADDRESS

02:50:48.438 --> 02:50:48.938
TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES OF THE

02:50:49.005 --> 02:50:51.174
SOCIETAL COSTS THE ONE IS THE

02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:51.674
DESTRUCTION OF POWER TO

02:50:51.741 --> 02:50:54.944
CRITICAL FACILITIES. AND THE

02:50:55.011 --> 02:50:56.079
OTHER IS THE RISK THAT POWER

02:50:56.145 --> 02:50:58.281
SHUT OFF IMPOSES ON CERTAIN

02:50:58.348 --> 02:50:58.781
CATEGORIES OF HONORABLE

02:50:58.848 --> 02:51:02.118
CUSTOMERS. OF SEWER AND STORAGE

02:51:02.185 --> 02:51:03.920
CAN CONTRIBUTE TO RESILIENCY

02:51:03.987 --> 02:51:04.520
AND CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE

02:51:04.587 --> 02:51:07.890
COST A PARTIAL LOSS. UNDER

02:51:07.957 --> 02:51:08.491
THREE BROAD CONFIGURATIONS SO

02:51:08.558 --> 02:51:11.527
THE FIRST WOULD BE. THE

02:51:11.594 --> 02:51:13.596
SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO DEPLOY

02:51:13.663 --> 02:51:15.765
IS PROVIDING BACKUP POWER FOR

02:51:15.832 --> 02:51:16.633
SINGLE FACILITIES ARE

02:51:16.699 --> 02:51:20.470
RESIDENCES AND RECENT ACTIONS

02:51:20.536 --> 02:51:22.071
HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

02:51:22.138 --> 02:51:23.873
PC OF ALREADY SHOWN A STRONG

02:51:23.940 --> 02:51:25.108
INTEREST IN HELPING FACILITATE

02:51:25.174 --> 02:51:27.076
THAT. I CAN TALK ABOUT ABOUT

02:51:27.143 --> 02:51:30.346
THAT'LL IT MORE LATER. THE

02:51:30.413 --> 02:51:30.913
OTHER TWO CONFIGURATIONS ARE

02:51:30.980 --> 02:51:31.881
MORE CHALLENGING FINANCIALLY

02:51:31.948 --> 02:51:32.315
REGULATORY EARLY AND

02:51:32.382 --> 02:51:36.252
TECHNICALLY. THE SECOND IS THAT.

02:51:36.319 --> 02:51:38.554
A DISTRIBUTED SOLAR IN STORAGE

02:51:38.621 --> 02:51:39.789
COULD BE CONFIGURED IN A WAY

02:51:39.856 --> 02:51:41.557
THAT UTILITIES OR UTILITIES TO

02:51:41.624 --> 02:51:43.059
AGGREGATORS COULD CALM THOSE

02:51:43.126 --> 02:51:44.394
RESOURCES TO HELP MAINTAIN

02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:46.329
RELIABILITY SO THAT NO ONE

02:51:46.396 --> 02:51:48.464
LOSES POWER THIS IS RELATED TO

02:51:48.531 --> 02:51:50.400
THE LIKE THE IN MINUS ONE

02:51:50.466 --> 02:51:52.035
CONTINGENCIES THAT UTILITIES

02:51:52.101 --> 02:51:54.937
ALREADY REQUIRED TO PREPARE FOR.

02:51:55.004 --> 02:51:55.672
AND IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE A

02:51:55.738 --> 02:51:56.639
COMMUNITY THAT DOESN'T ENTIRELY

02:51:56.706 --> 02:51:58.708
ISOLATED MAYBE IT HAS TWO OR

02:51:58.775 --> 02:51:59.475
THREE DIFFERENT TRANSITION

02:51:59.542 --> 02:52:02.445
PATHWAYS SERVING IT. BUT IN THE

02:52:02.512 --> 02:52:03.046
EVENT THAT ONE OR TWO OF THOSE

02:52:03.112 --> 02:52:05.481
NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE.

02:52:05.548 --> 02:52:06.749
WHERE UTILITY WOULD NORMALLY

02:52:06.816 --> 02:52:09.185
NEED TO. START INITIATING

02:52:09.252 --> 02:52:11.120
ROTATING OUTAGES IN ORDER TO

02:52:11.187 --> 02:52:13.089
BALANCE. THE DEMAND AND THE

02:52:13.156 --> 02:52:13.690
LOAD POCKET BUT THE AVAILABLE

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:16.793
SUPPLY. D. E. OURS COULD BE

02:52:16.859 --> 02:52:20.029
CALLED ON TO HELP THE UTILITY

02:52:20.096 --> 02:52:20.630
RIDE THROUGH THOSE HOURS WERE

02:52:20.697 --> 02:52:24.067
DEMAND MIGHT EXCEED. THE

02:52:24.133 --> 02:52:24.967
AVAILABLE SUPPLY AND OUR JUST

02:52:25.034 --> 02:52:26.169
COULD BE AVOIDED. THAT IS

02:52:26.235 --> 02:52:27.470
CHALLENGING WE DON'T REALLY

02:52:27.537 --> 02:52:28.738
HAVE THE REGULATORY PROCESS IN

02:52:28.805 --> 02:52:31.274
PLACE TO DO THAT. THERE'S A AN

02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:33.309
ANALOGOUS PROGRAM AT THE CHI SO

02:52:33.376 --> 02:52:34.610
RUNS THE RELIABILITY DEMAND

02:52:34.677 --> 02:52:37.046
RESPONSE RESOURCE PROGRAM. MY

02:52:37.113 --> 02:52:38.347
IMPRESSION IS IT'S AN UNDER

02:52:38.414 --> 02:52:39.682
UTILIZED PROGRAM AND IT'S NOT

02:52:39.749 --> 02:52:42.151
GEOGRAPHICALLY GRANULAR ENOUGH.

02:52:42.218 --> 02:52:46.055
BUT IT COULD SERVE AS A MODEL

02:52:46.122 --> 02:52:46.656
FOR HOW WE WOULD USE THE OURS

02:52:46.723 --> 02:52:49.525
IN THIS HI CONFIGURATION. AND

02:52:49.592 --> 02:52:51.127
THEN THE THIRD IS USING SOLAR

02:52:51.194 --> 02:52:53.096
STORAGE AND OTHER DVRS. AND A

02:52:53.162 --> 02:52:54.130
FULLY ISLAND AND MICRO GRIDS

02:52:54.197 --> 02:52:56.199
OPERATION MODE. AND THERE ARE

02:52:56.265 --> 02:52:58.401
VERY FEW EXAMPLES OF THAT THAT

02:52:58.468 --> 02:52:59.902
SPANNED MORE THAN A COUPLE OF

02:52:59.969 --> 02:53:01.504
FACILITIES AND FOR MANY OF YOU

02:53:01.571 --> 02:53:02.038
ARE FAMILIAR WITH BREAK A

02:53:02.105 --> 02:53:05.108
SPRINGS THAT TAKE YEARS IT WAS

02:53:05.174 --> 02:53:06.843
FUNDED BY. NUMEROUS GRANTS

02:53:06.909 --> 02:53:08.211
IMMUNITY COMMISSION FROM DO YOU

02:53:08.277 --> 02:53:09.879
EAT THE UTILITIES AND IT TOOK A

02:53:09.946 --> 02:53:13.716
LONG TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT. BUT

02:53:13.783 --> 02:53:15.384
JUST BECAUSE DIFFICULT DOESN'T

02:53:15.451 --> 02:53:17.220
MEAN THAT IT'S NOT WORTH

02:53:17.286 --> 02:53:17.787
PUTTING CONSIDERABLE EFFORT

02:53:17.854 --> 02:53:20.456
INTO EVALUATING. WHERE THE

02:53:20.523 --> 02:53:22.825
SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES ARE THAT

02:53:22.892 --> 02:53:24.961
MIGHT MOST BENEFIT FROM USING

02:53:25.027 --> 02:53:27.396
D. R. AS IN THESE WAYS AND THEN

02:53:27.463 --> 02:53:29.198
AND VIGOROUSLY PURSUING AT

02:53:29.265 --> 02:53:31.334
LEAST SOME PILOTS TO START.

02:53:31.400 --> 02:53:33.703
THOSE LESSONS LEARNED AND TO

02:53:33.770 --> 02:53:34.170
DEVELOP THE REGULATORY

02:53:34.237 --> 02:53:34.737
FRAMEWORK THAT WE NEED TO DO

02:53:34.804 --> 02:53:37.673
THAT. IN THE MEANTIME WE SHOULD

02:53:37.740 --> 02:53:38.474
STRIVE TO ACCELERATE THE

02:53:38.541 --> 02:53:40.143
DEPLOYMENT OF DVRS FOR THAT

02:53:40.209 --> 02:53:41.911
FIRST USE CASE SINGLE FACILITY

02:53:41.978 --> 02:53:44.347
OR SINGLE RESIDENTS BACKUP

02:53:44.413 --> 02:53:44.914
POWER. WE CAN DO THAT NOW WE

02:53:44.981 --> 02:53:47.650
CAN DO THAT QUICKLY IN THIS

02:53:47.717 --> 02:53:50.019
WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE. THE

02:53:50.086 --> 02:53:51.854
COST THE POWER CHAU LOS IMPOSE

02:53:51.921 --> 02:53:54.457
ON THESE MOBILE CUSTOMERS. AND

02:53:54.524 --> 02:53:56.592
COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE THESE ARE

02:53:56.659 --> 02:53:57.560
CRITICAL FACILITIES MAINTAIN

02:53:57.627 --> 02:53:59.529
POWER. THERE'S ONE THING I

02:53:59.595 --> 02:54:00.096
WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT WE

02:54:00.163 --> 02:54:02.565
OFTEN THINK ABOUT. SOLAR AND

02:54:02.632 --> 02:54:03.466
STORAGE IS BEING THE ALL IN

02:54:03.533 --> 02:54:05.535
SOLUTION AND- THE UTILITIES

02:54:05.601 --> 02:54:07.637
HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROMOTING THE

02:54:07.703 --> 02:54:10.039
USE OF BACKUP GENERATORS.

02:54:10.106 --> 02:54:10.640
HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE

02:54:10.706 --> 02:54:14.243
BACKUP GENERATORS. THE ONE

02:54:14.310 --> 02:54:15.044
INTERESTING APPOINT KEEP IN

02:54:15.111 --> 02:54:16.579
MIND. IS THAT EVEN WHERE THESE

02:54:16.646 --> 02:54:18.681
FOSSIL FUELED BACKUP GENERATORS

02:54:18.748 --> 02:54:21.284
ARE ALREADY IN PLACE OR

02:54:21.350 --> 02:54:23.152
CUSTOMERS ARE CONSIDERING LIKE.

02:54:23.219 --> 02:54:26.389
ODD THE- CUSTOMER THE PURCHASE

02:54:26.455 --> 02:54:26.956
THE TWO FIVE MEGAWATT CASTER

02:54:27.023 --> 02:54:30.059
BINDS. THE USE OF SOLAR AND

02:54:30.126 --> 02:54:30.960
STORAGE AND ACTUALLY ENHANCE

02:54:31.027 --> 02:54:31.828
THE RESILIENCY CAN WORK IN

02:54:31.894 --> 02:54:33.229
TANDEM WITH OF TRADITIONAL

02:54:33.296 --> 02:54:34.897
FOSSIL FUEL GENERATOR AND

02:54:34.964 --> 02:54:36.332
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE

02:54:36.399 --> 02:54:37.967
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THE WAY

02:54:38.034 --> 02:54:39.202
THAT IT DOES US OBVIOUSLY JUST

02:54:39.268 --> 02:54:40.803
SOLAR WILL DISPLACE KILOWATT

02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:42.772
HOURS OTHERWISE PRODUCED BY THE

02:54:42.839 --> 02:54:45.942
DIESEL OR GAS FOR GENERATOR.

02:54:46.008 --> 02:54:48.177
BUT WITH THE ARK ADDITION OF

02:54:48.244 --> 02:54:50.746
STORAGE THAT ENHANCES. THE

02:54:50.813 --> 02:54:52.782
ABILITY OF THE BACKUP GENERATOR

02:54:52.849 --> 02:54:53.883
TO OPERATE IN A MORE STEADY

02:54:53.950 --> 02:54:55.885
STATE MODE BECAUSE DID THE

02:54:55.952 --> 02:54:57.687
STORAGE CAN ABSORB THE LARGE

02:54:57.753 --> 02:54:59.589
FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND THAT ARE

02:54:59.655 --> 02:55:00.756
TYPICAL SERVING ONE CUSTOMER

02:55:00.823 --> 02:55:02.091
THEY'RE NOT SMOOTHED OUT BY

02:55:02.158 --> 02:55:04.293
HAVING. HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS

02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:06.229
OF CUSTOMERS WE GET SMOOTH

02:55:06.295 --> 02:55:10.032
TRANSITIONS THEY'RE VERY.

02:55:10.099 --> 02:55:11.734
JAGGED FOR SPIKES IN DEMAND AND

02:55:11.801 --> 02:55:12.935
THAT CAUSES A DIESEL GENERATOR

02:55:13.002 --> 02:55:14.170
TO OPERATE VERY INEFFICIENTLY

02:55:14.237 --> 02:55:15.438
AND IT STARTS EMITTING A LOT OF

02:55:15.504 --> 02:55:18.107
PARTICULATES AS IS RAMPING UP

02:55:18.174 --> 02:55:19.575
QUICKLY TO TRY TO MEET THOSE. I

02:55:19.642 --> 02:55:21.844
WIDE SWINGS IN DEMAND I KNOW

02:55:21.911 --> 02:55:23.312
THAT THE NATIONAL NOBLE ENERGY

02:55:23.379 --> 02:55:25.181
LAB AND OTHERS HAVE. DONE SOME

02:55:25.248 --> 02:55:25.848
STUDIES AND SHOWN THE

02:55:25.915 --> 02:55:28.451
SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OF ADDING

02:55:28.517 --> 02:55:31.287
STORAGE. AS A HYBRID. BACK UP

02:55:31.354 --> 02:55:35.057
CLUB POWER SUPPLY. AND SO WITH

02:55:35.124 --> 02:55:36.292
THAT I'LL JUST I'LL CLOSE HERE

02:55:36.359 --> 02:55:36.759
AND SAY THAT WE REALLY

02:55:36.826 --> 02:55:37.360
APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION THAT

02:55:37.426 --> 02:55:38.761
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE SI PC

02:55:38.828 --> 02:55:40.263
HAVE ALREADY GIVEN TO THE SE

02:55:40.329 --> 02:55:41.530
OF CLEAN THE OURS TO PROVIDE

02:55:41.597 --> 02:55:43.833
THIS BACK UP AND RESILIENCY

02:55:43.900 --> 02:55:44.800
BENEFIT IN ADDITION TO THE MORE

02:55:44.867 --> 02:55:47.370
CUSTOMARY OF BENEFITS THAT WE

02:55:47.436 --> 02:55:52.074
THINK OF LIKE GRID VALUE AN

02:55:52.141 --> 02:55:54.310
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. GOOD

02:55:54.377 --> 02:55:55.077
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:55:55.144 --> 02:55:57.246
THAT INSIGHT INTO THAT AREA

02:55:57.313 --> 02:56:00.483
THAT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE

02:56:00.549 --> 02:56:01.083
THINKING ABOUT AS MUCH AS THEY

02:56:01.150 --> 02:56:03.486
SHOULD DISCUSS WITH. WELCOME

02:56:03.552 --> 02:56:05.855
AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER

WITH THE CENTER FOR ACCESSIBLE

02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:10.960
TECHNOLOGY WHERE I REGULARLY

02:56:11.027 --> 02:56:12.528
REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE

02:56:12.595 --> 02:56:14.130
DISABILITY COMMUNITY BEFORE THE

02:56:14.196 --> 02:56:14.697
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:56:14.764 --> 02:56:17.199
COMMISSION. I'VE WORKED ON

02:56:17.266 --> 02:56:18.534
ISSUES REGARDING THE ENERGY

02:56:18.601 --> 02:56:19.769
STATION SINCE THE FIRST

02:56:19.835 --> 02:56:21.504
APPLICATION BY SAN DIEGO GAS

02:56:21.570 --> 02:56:23.606
ELECTRIC BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

02:56:23.673 --> 02:56:24.640
EIGHT FOLLOWING WHAT WITHIN THE

02:56:24.707 --> 02:56:25.875
MOST DISASTROUS FIRES IN STATE

02:56:25.942 --> 02:56:29.345
HISTORY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN.

02:56:29.412 --> 02:56:31.280
I WANT TO START UP A JOINING

02:56:31.347 --> 02:56:32.081
THE OTHER PANELISTS BY THANKING

02:56:32.148 --> 02:56:33.282
YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS

02:56:33.349 --> 02:56:35.251
ISSUE. AND THE COMPLEX ISSUES

02:56:35.318 --> 02:56:36.452
ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENERGY

02:56:36.519 --> 02:56:37.987
STATION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT

02:56:38.054 --> 02:56:40.756
PARTICULARLY HIGH RISK.

02:56:40.823 --> 02:56:42.625
EVERYONE AGREES THE POWERSHOT

02:56:42.692 --> 02:56:43.225
OFFICE CREATE RISK OF HARM TO

02:56:43.292 --> 02:56:45.928
AFFECTED POPULATIONS EVEN AS

02:56:45.995 --> 02:56:47.296
THEIR INTENT IS TO REDUCE THE

02:56:47.363 --> 02:56:47.863
OVERALL RISK OF CATASTROPHIC

02:56:47.930 --> 02:56:50.967
WILD FIRE. BUT THE RISKS ARE

02:56:51.033 --> 02:56:51.534
NOT SPREAD EVENLY THROUGHOUT

02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:55.371
THE POPULATION. AS IS SO OFTEN

02:56:55.438 --> 02:56:56.505
THE CASE HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE

02:56:56.572 --> 02:56:58.975
ALREADY VULNERABLE INCLUDING

02:56:59.041 --> 02:56:59.575
THOSE THAT CONTAIN A PERSON

02:56:59.642 --> 02:57:01.477
WITH A DISABILITY SOMEONE WHO

02:57:01.544 --> 02:57:04.113
SUFFERS FROM CHRONIC ILLNESS OR

02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:05.281
ANY OTHER FORM OF ACCESS TO

02:57:05.348 --> 02:57:06.549
FUNCTIONAL NEED ARE AT

02:57:06.615 --> 02:57:08.417
INCREASED RISK OF HARM.

02:57:08.484 --> 02:57:09.051
PARTICULARLY DURING AN EXTENDED

02:57:09.118 --> 02:57:12.221
POWER SHUT OFF. THIS IS BEEN

02:57:12.288 --> 02:57:12.922
GENERALLY IDENTIFIED IN THE

02:57:12.989 --> 02:57:14.457
EXTREMELY HELPFUL BACKGROUND

02:57:14.523 --> 02:57:16.325
PAPER. BUT I WANT TO ELABORATE

02:57:16.392 --> 02:57:18.327
ON SOME OF THE A CONSTITUENCIES

02:57:18.394 --> 02:57:20.262
WERE MOST AT RISK. AND

02:57:20.329 --> 02:57:20.730
HOPEFULLY DISCUSS SOME

02:57:20.796 --> 02:57:24.767
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. TO THE

02:57:24.834 --> 02:57:26.202
WHITE PAPER SPECIFICALLY NOTES

02:57:26.268 --> 02:57:27.536
THAT HOUSEHOLD CONTAINING A

02:57:27.603 --> 02:57:28.904
PERSON WITH A DISABILITY ARE AT

02:57:28.971 --> 02:57:31.207
RISK. BUT IT IS DOESN'T GIVE

02:57:31.273 --> 02:57:32.241
SPECIFICS OF WHO THESE PEOPLE

02:57:32.308 --> 02:57:33.909
MIGHT BE THERE WAS SOME

02:57:33.976 --> 02:57:34.510
DISCUSSION EARLIER OF MEDICAL

02:57:34.577 --> 02:57:36.812
BASELINE. BUT THAT'S ONLY A

02:57:36.879 --> 02:57:38.781
TINY SLIVER OF THE POPULATION

02:57:38.848 --> 02:57:39.648
THAT ACTUALLY AT RISK OF HARM

02:57:39.715 --> 02:57:44.086
DURING AN EXTENDED POWER OUTAGE.

02:57:44.153 --> 02:57:44.720
GREATER EXAMPLES OF COMMUNITIES

02:57:44.787 --> 02:57:49.325
AT RISK. MOST OBVIOUSLY ARE

02:57:49.392 --> 02:57:49.925
PEOPLE WHO RELY ON RESPIRATORS

02:57:49.992 --> 02:57:52.328
OR OTHER DEVICES TO BRIEF.

02:57:52.395 --> 02:57:53.829
THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE AT RISK

02:57:53.896 --> 02:57:56.699
OF DEATH WITHOUT ONGOING ACCESS

02:57:56.766 --> 02:57:58.501
TO A CONSISTENT ENERGY SUPPLY

02:57:58.567 --> 02:57:59.135
AND THEY SIMPLY MUST HAVE POWER

02:57:59.201 --> 02:58:02.671
FOR THE DURATION. BEYOND THAT

02:58:02.738 --> 02:58:04.173
THOUGH THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE

02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:05.841
WHO RELY ON AN EXTENSIVE ARRAY

02:58:05.908 --> 02:58:07.076
OF MEDICAL DEVICES POWERED BY

02:58:07.143 --> 02:58:07.676
ELECTRICITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR

02:58:07.743 --> 02:58:11.080
HEALTH. THESE CAN INCLUDE

02:58:11.147 --> 02:58:11.614
INSULIN PUMPS AND GLUCOSE

02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:14.583

WELL AS WIRELESS COMPONENTS AND

02:58:22.525 --> 02:58:23.392
ALSO DEPEND ON RELIABLE

02:58:23.459 --> 02:58:23.793
FUNCTIONING OF THE

HEALTH RISKS TO THESE

02:58:28.931 --> 02:58:29.799
POPULATIONS DURING AN EXTENDED

02:58:29.865 --> 02:58:31.133
OUTAGE MAY BE LESS DRAMATIC

02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:32.501
THAN LOSS OF RESPIRATOR

02:58:32.568 --> 02:58:34.403
ASSISTANCE BUT THEY'RE NO LESS

02:58:34.470 --> 02:58:35.004
REAL. AND THEY MAY BE NO LESS

02:58:35.071 --> 02:58:38.007
SEVERE. THEN THERE ARE

02:58:38.074 --> 02:58:39.308
POPULATIONS WHO RELY ON

02:58:39.375 --> 02:58:40.476
MEDICATION THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:58:40.543 --> 02:58:43.979
REFRIGERATED INCLUDING INSULIN.

02:58:44.046 --> 02:58:45.081
IN ADDITION TO THE IMMEDIATE

02:58:45.147 --> 02:58:47.149
HEALTH RISKS TO THESE PEOPLE IF

02:58:47.216 --> 02:58:47.683
THEY'RE UNABLE TO PROPERLY

02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:50.152
STORE THEIR MEDICATION. AN

02:58:50.219 --> 02:58:51.487
EXTENDED POWER OUTAGE MAY CAUSE

02:58:51.554 --> 02:58:54.290
SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BURDENS AS

02:58:54.356 --> 02:58:55.558
PEOPLE HAVE TO REPLACE THE LOST

02:58:55.624 --> 02:58:56.158
MEDICATIONS POTENTIALLY OUT OF

02:58:56.225 --> 02:59:00.663
POCKET. THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE

02:59:00.729 --> 02:59:01.163
WHO USE MOBILITY DEVICES

02:59:01.230 --> 02:59:03.833
POWERED BY ELECTRICITY. THEY

02:59:03.899 --> 02:59:05.267
MAY NOT BE AN IMMEDIATE RISK OF

02:59:05.334 --> 02:59:07.303
HARM WHEN A POWER OUTAGE TAKES

02:59:07.369 --> 02:59:08.871
PLACE BUT IF THERE'S ANOTHER

02:59:08.938 --> 02:59:10.940
EMERGENCY OF A FIRE ACTUALLY

02:59:11.006 --> 02:59:12.975
BREAKS OUT IN AN EVACUATION IS

02:59:13.042 --> 02:59:14.276
ORDERED. THEIR ABILITY TO

EVACUATE MOVE TO SAY FIFTY IS

02:59:16.345 --> 02:59:16.745
LIKELY TO BE EXTREMELY

02:59:16.812 --> 02:59:20.483
COMPROMISED. THEN THERE ARE

02:59:20.549 --> 02:59:21.016
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T TOLERATE

02:59:21.083 --> 02:59:24.019
EXTREME TEMPERATURES. THIS

02:59:24.086 --> 02:59:26.422
GROUP OF PEOPLE MAY FACE X. THE

02:59:26.489 --> 02:59:28.491
IMMEDIATE HEALTH RISKS OF OR

02:59:28.557 --> 02:59:29.658
ELSE THEY MAY BE FORCED OUT OF

02:59:29.725 --> 02:59:31.026
THEIR HOMES BECAUSE BY

02:59:31.093 --> 02:59:32.862
DEFINITION OF P. SPS ADVANTAGE

02:59:32.928 --> 02:59:34.530
IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE DURING

THAT SANTA ANA CONDITION OR

02:59:35.965 --> 02:59:37.833
TIME OF HIGH WINDED HIGH FIRE

02:59:37.900 --> 02:59:38.434
THREAT. WHEN TEMPERATURES ARE

02:59:38.501 --> 02:59:42.605
HIGH. THEY MAY FACE IN ADDITION

02:59:42.671 --> 02:59:43.973
TO THE HEALTH RISKS SUBSTANTIAL

02:59:44.039 --> 02:59:45.808
ECONOMIC BURDENS. AS THEY UP

02:59:45.875 --> 02:59:48.043
ARE FORCED TO PAY OUT OF POCKET

02:59:48.110 --> 02:59:49.145
TO GET THEMSELVES TO A LOCATION

02:59:49.211 --> 02:59:51.380
OF SAFETY. AND STAY THERE FOR

02:59:51.447 --> 02:59:53.949
AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. SO

02:59:54.016 --> 02:59:54.483
THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

02:59:54.550 --> 03:00:00.656
BROADER COMMUNITY. IDENTIFIERS

03:00:00.723 --> 03:00:01.257
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE

03:00:01.323 --> 03:00:05.261
AT RISK. THE WHITE PAPER ALSO

03:00:05.327 --> 03:00:06.629
IDENTIFY SOME SOCIAL COSTS OF

03:00:06.695 --> 03:00:08.330
THE ENERGY STATION. BUT IT

03:00:08.397 --> 03:00:09.398
LEAVES OUT MANY FORESEEABLE

03:00:09.465 --> 03:00:11.567
COSTS INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE

03:00:11.634 --> 03:00:13.903
MOST LIKELY TO IMPACT A. F. AND

03:00:13.969 --> 03:00:14.503
WHICH IS ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL

03:00:14.570 --> 03:00:18.407
NEEDS HOUSEHOLDS. FOR EXAMPLE

03:00:18.474 --> 03:00:19.241
THE WHITE PAPER DOES KNOW THE

03:00:19.308 --> 03:00:20.743
POTENTIAL FOR HAMPERED IT BACK

03:00:20.809 --> 03:00:22.978
YOU ASIANS. BUT IT LEAVES OUT

03:00:23.045 --> 03:00:23.646
IMPORTANT BARRIERS THAT MAY BE

03:00:23.712 --> 03:00:26.549
WIDESPREAD. INCLUDING RISKS TO

03:00:26.615 --> 03:00:27.383
PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

03:00:27.449 --> 03:00:30.019
MANUALLY OPEN THEIR GARAGE DOOR

03:00:30.085 --> 03:00:30.619
IN ORDER TO GET THEIR CAR OUT

03:00:30.686 --> 03:00:33.422
OF THEIR RESIDENTS. PEOPLE WHO

03:00:33.489 --> 03:00:35.257
CAN'T GET OUT OF THEIR HOMES IF

03:00:35.324 --> 03:00:35.691
THE ELEVATORS AREN'T

03:00:35.758 --> 03:00:36.258
FUNCTIONING DUE TO A LACK OF

03:00:36.325 --> 03:00:38.227
POWER. AND PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:00:38.294 --> 03:00:39.261
DEPENDENT FOR MOBILITY ON

03:00:39.328 --> 03:00:40.829
DEVICES SUCH AS POWER

03:00:40.896 --> 03:00:41.397
WHEELCHAIR SCOOTERS THAT MAY

03:00:41.463 --> 03:00:44.967
LOSE ACCESS TO CHARGING. THE

03:00:45.034 --> 03:00:46.001
WHITE PAPER OF KNOWLEDGE IS

03:00:46.068 --> 03:00:47.136
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES TO

03:00:47.203 --> 03:00:49.772
BUSINESSES. BUT IT DOESN'T TALK

03:00:49.838 --> 03:00:50.806
ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES

03:00:50.873 --> 03:00:52.875
TO INDIVIDUALS. WHICH CAN

03:00:52.942 --> 03:00:54.276
INCLUDE LOSS OF FOOD AND

03:00:54.343 --> 03:00:54.843
MEDICINE WHEN FEDERATION IS

03:00:54.910 --> 03:00:57.680
DISRUPTED. LOST EARNINGS WITH A

03:00:57.746 --> 03:00:59.882
PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT IS CLOSED

03:00:59.949 --> 03:01:00.649
AN OUT OF POCKET SAFETY IN

SPENDING IN ORDER TO ENHANCE

03:01:04.386 --> 03:01:07.289
THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY. THIS IS

03:01:07.356 --> 03:01:08.757
A SERIOUS ISSUE FOR ACCESS AND

03:01:08.824 --> 03:01:09.358
FUNCTIONAL NEEDS OF

03:01:09.425 --> 03:01:10.759
COMMUNITIES. MAY FACE MORE

03:01:10.826 --> 03:01:12.661
LOSSES THAN AVERAGE AND ALSO

03:01:12.728 --> 03:01:14.163
ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LIKELY

03:01:14.230 --> 03:01:16.632
TO BE LOW INCOME AND NOT WELL

03:01:16.699 --> 03:01:17.199
POSITIONED TO ABSORB OUT OF

03:01:17.266 --> 03:01:19.235
POCKET COSTS. AND THEN FINALLY

03:01:19.301 --> 03:01:20.502
THE WHITE PAPER NOTES THE

03:01:20.569 --> 03:01:22.171
POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED FIRE

03:01:22.238 --> 03:01:24.573
RISKS DO PEOPLE WHO USE

03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:25.174
GENERATORS DURING THE TIME OF

03:01:25.241 --> 03:01:27.610
AN EXTENDED OUTAGE. BUT IT

03:01:27.676 --> 03:01:28.877
DOESN'T IDENTIFY OTHER FIRE

03:01:28.944 --> 03:01:30.846
TRIGGERS SUCH AS PEOPLE WHO MAY

03:01:30.913 --> 03:01:32.314
USE CANDLES OR OTHER FLAME

03:01:32.381 --> 03:01:33.816
BASED SOURCES OF LIGHT IF THE

03:01:33.882 --> 03:01:35.951
POWERS ARE OUT. BACKYARD GRILLS

03:01:36.018 --> 03:01:37.786

OTHER FIRE TRIGGERS THAT MAY

03:01:41.523 --> 03:01:45.828
COME. ACTUALLY INCREASE THE

RISK OF FIRE WHEN THE GREATEST

03:01:46.495 --> 03:01:51.500

03:01:51.567 --> 03:01:54.169
SUBSTANTIALLY THE LIST OF RISKS

03:01:54.236 --> 03:01:56.438
I DO WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON

03:01:56.505 --> 03:01:56.939
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT

03:11:25.373 --> 03:11:26.842
THOSE DECISIONS. SO WE CAN HAVE

03:11:26.908 --> 03:11:27.909
CONSTANT UPDATES OF WANT THE

03:11:27.976 --> 03:11:29.945
ESTIMATED TIME RESTORATION.

03:11:30.011 --> 03:11:30.712
WHAT IS OUR PROCESS WHAT ARE

03:11:30.779 --> 03:11:31.780
THEY SEEING ON THE GROUND WITH

03:11:31.847 --> 03:11:33.448
THEIR SSTEM. ARE THEY STARTING

03:11:33.515 --> 03:11:35.050
THEIR INSPECTION SO THAT WE

03:11:35.116 --> 03:11:35.817
COULD ALSO START INSPECTION OF

03:11:35.884 --> 03:11:36.918
OUR SYSTEM TO RE ENERGIZE OUR

03:11:36.985 --> 03:11:39.354
SYSTEM. BUT THAT CONSECUENCIAS

03:11:39.421 --> 03:11:41.389
IN FROM THE INITIAL THOUGHT OF

03:11:41.456 --> 03:11:42.557
HEY THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING

03:11:42.624 --> 03:11:44.025
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. ALL THE

03:11:44.092 --> 03:11:45.527
WAY THROUGH RESTORATION IS

03:11:45.594 --> 03:11:47.062
REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND

03:11:47.128 --> 03:11:50.165
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CLEAR

03:11:50.232 --> 03:11:57.038
MECHANISM. THAT REQUIRES THAT.

03:11:57.105 --> 03:11:57.606
THE GATE AND THEN THE OTHER

03:11:57.672 --> 03:11:58.773
THING OF HARD HIT ON IS. THIS

03:11:58.840 --> 03:11:59.274
NEEDS TO BE A SHORT TERM

03:11:59.341 --> 03:12:01.509
SOLUTION. THE UNCERTAINTY OF

03:12:01.576 --> 03:12:02.444
SHUTDOWNS TRYING TO RUN A CITY

03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:03.712
TRYING TO RUN BUSINESSES TRYING

03:12:03.778 --> 03:12:06.414
TO JUST LIVE YOUR NORMAL LIFE.

03:12:06.481 --> 03:12:07.515
THIS NEEDS TO BE A SHORT TERM

03:12:07.582 --> 03:12:09.050
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

03:12:09.117 --> 03:12:10.986
SHOULD BE HAPPENING CALIFORNIA

03:12:11.052 --> 03:12:11.586
THIS IS A GREAT STATE. THERE'S

03:12:11.653 --> 03:12:13.889
A LOT OF TALENTED PEOPLE HERE.

03:12:13.955 --> 03:12:15.423
THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION AT ALL

03:12:15.490 --> 03:12:16.725
AND SO WE NEED TO FIND WAYS

03:12:16.791 --> 03:12:18.560
THAT YOU KNOW. IDENTIFY WHAT

03:12:18.627 --> 03:12:19.861
ARE THE KEY ISSUES AND REALLY

03:12:19.928 --> 03:12:23.064
DRIVE AFTER THOSE SOLUTIONS.

03:12:23.131 --> 03:12:24.132
SALUTE THIS BECOME SOMETHING

03:12:24.199 --> 03:12:26.167
THAT'S IN OUR PAST AND WE'VE

03:12:26.234 --> 03:12:28.436
LEARNED FROM IT BUT WE'VE MOVED

03:12:28.503 --> 03:12:29.004
ON TO SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH

03:12:29.070 --> 03:12:32.307
MORE RELIABLE. SO WHATEVER THAT

03:12:32.374 --> 03:12:34.042
TAKES YOU KNOW PUBLICLY OWNED

03:12:34.109 --> 03:12:35.043
UTILITIES ARE CERTAINLY WILLING

03:12:35.110 --> 03:12:37.279
TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT EFFORT.

03:12:37.345 --> 03:12:38.580
BUT THOSE ARE THE KEY POINTS

03:12:38.647 --> 03:12:40.315
THAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO DRIVE

03:12:40.382 --> 03:12:42.284
HOME WITH TO THE CHAIR AND THE

03:12:42.350 --> 03:12:44.452

APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK

03:12:45.587 --> 03:12:50.558
pTHEME IS THIS IS A TEMPORARY.

03:12:50.625 --> 03:12:53.161
SOLUTION TO A BUT HOPEFULLY

03:12:53.228 --> 03:12:55.530
TEMPORARY PROBLEM OF A SYSTEM

03:12:55.597 --> 03:13:00.535
THAT. IS NOT GOING TO WITHSTAND

03:13:00.602 --> 03:13:02.003
CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND HAS TO

03:13:02.070 --> 03:13:03.338
BE DE ENERGIZED TO THAT AND

03:13:03.405 --> 03:13:04.539
AGAIN. COMMUNICATION EARLY

03:13:04.606 --> 03:13:05.640
COMMUNICATIONS LETTING US KNOW

03:13:05.707 --> 03:13:06.608
WHAT'S GOING ON REALLY MAKING

03:13:06.675 --> 03:13:08.143
THOSE RISK ASSESSMENTS ON WHEN

03:13:08.209 --> 03:13:09.010

CRITICAL YOU CAN'T OVER DO IT.

03:13:59.928 --> 03:14:01.997
AND THE SECOND IS THAT WE HOPE

03:14:02.063 --> 03:14:04.766

LESSONS LEARNED. IN THE TO BE

03:14:08.370 --> 03:14:13.541
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THOSE.

03:14:13.608 --> 03:14:14.075
AND ADJUST THE APPROACH IS

03:14:14.142 --> 03:14:18.713
GOING FORWARD. SO A LITTLE BIT

ABOUT HE'S VERY MUCH NOW WE ARE

03:14:19.447 --> 03:14:19.914
A MAJOR PUBLIC UTILITY N

03:14:19.981 --> 03:14:20.749
CALIFORNIA. WE PROVIDE WATER

03:14:20.815 --> 03:14:21.282

HUNDRED FACILITIES THAT ARE IN

03:14:33.261 --> 03:14:35.563
THE SERVICE AREA AND IN THE

03:14:35.630 --> 03:14:36.197
COUNTIES ALTHOUGH WE LEADING UP

03:14:36.264 --> 03:14:39.467
TO OUR WATERSHED. N. DAB A

03:14:39.534 --> 03:14:40.235
PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF AS

03:14:40.301 --> 03:14:42.470
A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY OF

03:14:42.537 --> 03:14:43.738
IMPACTING US BECAUSE OUR

03:14:43.805 --> 03:14:45.373
SERVICE AREA GREAT PORTIONS OF

03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:47.642
IT. AND A WATERSHED ARE AT

03:14:47.709 --> 03:14:49.511
ELEVATION AND THEY ARE IN

03:14:49.577 --> 03:14:52.580
EXTREME FIRE THREAT AREAS. AND

03:14:52.647 --> 03:14:54.783
SO WHEN WE ENGAGED IN THIS

03:14:54.849 --> 03:14:56.151
PROCESS AS SOON AS WE HEARD

03:14:56.217 --> 03:14:57.352
ABOUT IT I THINK OUR FIRST

03:14:57.419 --> 03:14:59.087
LETTER COMMUNICATING OUR

03:14:59.154 --> 03:15:00.021
INTEREST IN BEING A PART OF THE

03:15:00.088 --> 03:15:01.456
PROCESS AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT

03:15:01.523 --> 03:15:03.058
IT MEANS WAS IN JULY OF TWENTY

03:15:03.124 --> 03:15:03.591
EIGHTEEN AS SOON AS IT WAS

03:15:03.658 --> 03:15:06.795
ANNOUNCED. AND WE HAVE BEEN

03:15:06.861 --> 03:15:08.196
WORKING HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND

03:15:08.263 --> 03:15:11.733
ADAPT EVER SINCE THEN. FOR US

03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:14.102
IT'S VERY REAL A DISTRIBUTION

03:15:14.169 --> 03:15:16.704
LEVEL EVENT L. DISTRIBUTION

03:15:16.771 --> 03:15:19.074
LEVEL ELECTRICAL OUTAGE HI HAS

03:15:19.140 --> 03:15:20.408
THE POSSIBILITY IS REFERRED TO

03:15:20.475 --> 03:15:23.378
LAST FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS AND IT%

03:15:23.445 --> 03:15:26.047
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT WE-

03:15:26.114 --> 03:15:29.284
LEARNED UP UNTIL LAST WEEK. UP

03:15:29.350 --> 03:15:29.751
TO TWO HUNDRED OF OUR

03:15:29.818 --> 03:15:31.853
FACILITIES AT HALF OF ALL THE

03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:33.588
FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE AND

03:15:33.655 --> 03:15:34.422
THEN LAST WEEK WE HEARD THAT

03:15:34.489 --> 03:15:36.124
MAYBE THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL

03:15:36.191 --> 03:15:37.058
FORTY THAT MIGHTBE IMPACTED

03:15:37.125 --> 03:15:38.793
BRINGING THE TOTAL TO FORTY. I

03:15:38.860 --> 03:15:39.928
JUST THE SEQUENCE OF

03:15:39.994 --> 03:15:41.062
CONVERSATIONS WERE TRYING TO

03:15:41.129 --> 03:15:43.431
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE POTENTIAL

03:15:43.498 --> 03:15:45.333
IMPLICATIONS ARE ANXIOUSLY AS

03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:47.302
ME TO SHARE THAT IN OF THE YEAR

03:15:47.368 --> 03:15:51.272
THE ACCURACY. OF THOSE

03:15:51.339 --> 03:15:51.906
ESTIMATES OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE

03:15:51.973 --> 03:15:56.144
IMPACTED. ARE AT VERY IMPORTANT

03:15:56.211 --> 03:15:57.178
ADAM AN OVER ESTIMATE WHICH

03:15:57.245 --> 03:15:57.979
MIGHT BE EASY TO PROVIDE CAUSES

03:15:58.046 --> 03:15:58.880
US AND OTHERS TO EXPEND

03:15:58.947 --> 03:16:01.149
CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES TRYING

03:16:01.216 --> 03:16:01.716
TO BE PREPARED FOR SOMETHING

03:16:01.783 --> 03:16:05.620
HUGE. CONVERSELY IN

03:16:05.687 --> 03:16:07.155
UNDERESTIMATING WHICH WE DON'T

03:16:07.222 --> 03:16:08.389
THINK SAID REALLY HAPPENED SO

03:16:08.456 --> 03:16:09.858
AT THIS POINT. WOULD ALLOW

03:16:09.924 --> 03:16:10.492
WOULD HAVE IS BEING

03:16:10.558 --> 03:16:12.560
INSUFFICIENTLY PREPARED SO.

03:16:12.627 --> 03:16:15.497
BACK TO YOU KNOW WE'RE AT A

03:16:15.563 --> 03:16:18.466
CRITICAL SERVICE PROVIDER HAS

03:16:18.533 --> 03:16:25.340
TO FIND OUT BY THAT. THE THAT

03:16:25.406 --> 03:16:26.040
THE P. S. P. S. REQUIREMENTS

03:16:26.107 --> 03:16:27.375
BUT ALSO YOU KNOW EVEN IN THE

03:16:27.442 --> 03:16:28.376
CONTEXT OF BEING PREPAREDNESS

03:16:28.443 --> 03:16:28.843
FOR PREPARE FOR OTHER

03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:31.946
EMERGENCIES DISASTERS. OUR

03:16:32.013 --> 03:16:34.149
NATIONAL SECURITY AND SO WE

03:16:34.215 --> 03:16:35.183
VIEW THAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY

03:16:35.250 --> 03:16:36.651
DESERVE TO HAVE ALL THE

03:16:36.718 --> 03:16:37.952
INFORMATION ALL THE POSSIBLE

03:16:38.019 --> 03:16:39.888
COORDINATION EVEN IF IT

03:16:39.954 --> 03:16:43.491
REQUIRES PGA ADDING EXTRA

03:16:43.558 --> 03:16:46.427
VALUABLE AND A GOOD INVESTMENT.

03:16:46.494 --> 03:16:46.995
SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING TO

03:16:47.061 --> 03:16:47.529
PREPARE JUST AS AN EXAMPLE

03:16:47.595 --> 03:16:50.632
UTILITY. FIVE WE'VE BEEN USING

03:16:50.698 --> 03:16:52.467
THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE

03:16:52.534 --> 03:16:54.169
THROUGH THAT COMMUNICATION AND

03:16:54.235 --> 03:16:56.804
COORDINATION TO TRY TO BE

03:16:56.871 --> 03:17:00.008
SURGICALLY FIVE I HAVE POSITION

03:17:00.074 --> 03:17:01.509
GENERATORS AND RESOURCES TO BE

03:17:01.576 --> 03:17:04.245
AVAILABLE BUT ALSO TRYING TO WE

03:17:04.312 --> 03:17:05.346
WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF

03:17:05.413 --> 03:17:06.681
RESPONSE TIME THAT WE HAVE

03:17:06.748 --> 03:17:08.883
RIGHT WE TALK ABOUT SEVENTY TWO

03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:10.485
HOURS. AT POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE

03:17:10.552 --> 03:17:12.253
BUT THE REALITIES IT COULD BE A

03:17:12.320 --> 03:17:13.188
WHOLE LOT LESS THE WEATHER

03:17:13.254 --> 03:17:14.522
CHANGES QUICKLY AND WE COULD

03:17:14.589 --> 03:17:15.790
JUST HAVE EIGHT HOURS OR LESS

03:17:15.857 --> 03:17:16.925
TO PREPARE BUT WE WANT THE

03:17:16.991 --> 03:17:18.860
COMMUNICATION CHANNELS TO BE

03:17:18.927 --> 03:17:20.195
VERY CLEAR SO THAT WE CAN

03:17:20.261 --> 03:17:22.931
MAXIMIZE THAT BECAUSE OF ANY

03:17:22.997 --> 03:17:23.565
ALL THE TIME WE GET TO MOBILIZE

03:17:23.631 --> 03:17:25.833
AND MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. OUR

03:17:25.900 --> 03:17:26.668
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS

03:17:26.734 --> 03:17:27.268
PROVIDING SAFE AND RELIABLE

03:17:27.335 --> 03:17:29.070
WATER SERVICE. WE WANT TO MAKE

03:17:29.137 --> 03:17:30.071
SURE THAT THE WATER IS

03:17:30.138 --> 03:17:31.973
AVAILABLE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS FOR

03:17:32.040 --> 03:17:32.907
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND FOR

03:17:32.974 --> 03:17:35.143
FIREFIGHTERS. WE ALSO WANT TO

03:17:35.210 --> 03:17:36.778
MAKE SURE THAT THROUGH OUR

03:17:36.844 --> 03:17:39.480
ACTIONS THAT WE AVOID A D.

03:17:39.547 --> 03:17:41.049
PRESSURIZATION INCIDENT RIGHT

03:17:41.115 --> 03:17:42.417
WE BASICALLY SUCKING SYSTEM

03:17:42.483 --> 03:17:44.085
DRIER PORTIONS OF THE SYSTEM

03:17:44.152 --> 03:17:45.587
DRY. BECAUSE THAT CREATES

03:17:45.653 --> 03:17:48.056
PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS AND THAT

03:17:48.122 --> 03:17:48.623
ALSO MAKES IT HARD TO FIGHT

03:17:48.690 --> 03:17:52.260
FIRES. SO WE HAVE STAFF IN

03:17:52.327 --> 03:17:52.760
EXPANDING CONSIDERABLE

03:17:52.827 --> 03:17:54.229
RESOURCES IT'S NOT LIKE WE

03:17:54.295 --> 03:17:55.597
HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED POWER

03:17:55.663 --> 03:17:57.031
OUTAGES BEFORE RIGHT THESE

03:17:57.098 --> 03:17:59.534
HAPPEN WE'VE EXPERIENCED THEM.

03:17:59.601 --> 03:18:01.302
BUT THE PARADIGM WAS DIFFERENT

03:18:01.369 --> 03:18:03.137
IT WAS WELL THERE'S A POWER

03:18:03.204 --> 03:18:04.639
OUTAGE IN OUR ELECT FOR SERVICE

03:18:04.706 --> 03:18:06.274
PROVIDERS WORK IN A S. A. P. TO

03:18:06.341 --> 03:18:08.376
TRY TO BRING THAT SAYS. THOSE

03:18:08.443 --> 03:18:08.910
SAID ISOLATED SYSTEMS BACK

03:18:08.977 --> 03:18:12.981
ONLINE. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:18:13.047 --> 03:18:14.182
LARGE AREAS THAT COULD BE

03:18:14.249 --> 03:18:17.151
IMPACTED. AND SO WE WANT THEM

03:18:17.218 --> 03:18:19.420
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE- WE

03:18:19.487 --> 03:18:20.688
HAD THIRTY THREE PORTABLE PUMPS

03:18:20.755 --> 03:18:21.756
AND GENERATORS HE'S OUR DIESEL

03:18:21.823 --> 03:18:24.158
SYSTEMS AND ALSO A NUMBER OF

03:18:24.225 --> 03:18:24.759
CRITICAL FACILITIES REATMENT

03:18:24.826 --> 03:18:27.061
PLANTS AND SUCH HAVE. A HARD

03:18:27.128 --> 03:18:30.164
STAND BY BY SYSTEMS. AND WE'VE

03:18:30.231 --> 03:18:30.999
ADDED TO THAT WOULD PRETTY MUCH

03:18:31.065 --> 03:18:33.901
DOUBLED IT BY LEASING EQUIPMENT

03:18:33.968 --> 03:18:36.371
THAT GOT IN EARLY BOARD

03:18:36.437 --> 03:18:38.273
APPROVED A- AN ADDITIONAL ON

03:18:38.339 --> 03:18:40.675
NEAR THIRTY FIVE GENERATORS. SO

03:18:40.742 --> 03:18:41.843
IMMOBILIZE THAT THROUGHOUT OUR

03:18:41.909 --> 03:18:44.078
SYSTEM BOB WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED

03:18:44.145 --> 03:18:44.879
AND THIRTY FIVE PUMPING PLANTS

03:18:44.946 --> 03:18:48.449
THROUGHOUT THE SERVICE AREA.

03:18:48.516 --> 03:18:53.221
AND WE ARE. AND SO WE'RE GOING

03:18:53.288 --> 03:18:53.821
TO TURN THOSE THINGS ON AND

03:18:53.888 --> 03:18:55.023
WE'VE GOT CONTRACTS FOR FUEL

03:18:55.089 --> 03:18:55.723
TENDERS TO MOVE AROUND FEEL

03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:56.891
AROUND IF THINGS ARE GONNA LAST

03:18:56.958 --> 03:18:57.458
MORE THAN. A COUPLE OF DAYS

03:18:57.525 --> 03:19:00.662
OUTAGE. AB BUT THERE'S GOING TO

03:19:00.728 --> 03:19:01.896
BE IMPACTS FROM THAT LINKS BACK

03:19:01.963 --> 03:19:02.764
TO SOME OF THE EARLIER

03:19:02.830 --> 03:19:04.165
COMMENTS. AB THESE ARE ALL

03:19:04.232 --> 03:19:06.467
DIESEL GENERATORS. AB AND

03:19:06.534 --> 03:19:07.802
THEY'LL BE RELEASING AIR

03:19:07.869 --> 03:19:09.437
EMISSIONS. I THAT'S

03:19:09.504 --> 03:19:10.972
INCONSISTENT WITH A EAST BAY

03:19:11.039 --> 03:19:12.373
MUCH GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:13.841
OBJECTIVES ARE CLIMATE CHANGE

03:19:13.908 --> 03:19:15.343
MONITORING ESPONSE PLANS IS

03:19:15.410 --> 03:19:16.944
NOT. THIS WAS IN PART OF THE

03:19:17.011 --> 03:19:19.414
PLAN TO GO TO DISTRIBUTED STAND

03:19:19.480 --> 03:19:21.382
BY SYSTEMS LIKE THIS. AND SO

03:19:21.449 --> 03:19:24.118
WILL BE WORKING TO TRY TO

03:19:24.185 --> 03:19:25.086
IDENTIFY CLEANER APPROACHES FOR

03:19:25.153 --> 03:19:27.588
THE FUTURE. WE ACTUALLY DON'T

03:19:27.655 --> 03:19:30.625
THINK THAT THIS WILL BE OVER

03:19:30.692 --> 03:19:31.092
THIS YEAR AND PROBABLY

03:19:31.159 --> 03:19:34.495
PERPETUATE INTO NEXT YEAR. BUT

03:19:34.562 --> 03:19:35.997
THEY WEREN'T AVAILABLE FOR US

03:19:36.064 --> 03:19:36.998
IN THE TIME THAT WE HAD A WAR

03:19:37.065 --> 03:19:38.066
OF THE SIZE OR HORSEPOWER

03:19:38.132 --> 03:19:38.933
DEPENDABILITY. UNFORTUNATELY

03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:40.768
DIESEL CAN RUN FOR FIVE TO

03:19:40.835 --> 03:19:42.870
SEVEN DAYS BUT THE BATTERIES.

03:19:42.937 --> 03:19:43.471
AND IS SOLAR IS NOT AVAILABLE

03:19:43.538 --> 03:19:47.408
IN A PORTABLE MODE. SO MAYBE

03:19:47.475 --> 03:19:48.242
THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE STATE

03:19:48.309 --> 03:19:48.843
AND THAT WAS EARLIER

03:19:48.910 --> 03:19:50.511
SUGGESTIONS ON HOW THAT MIGHT.

03:19:50.578 --> 03:19:52.547
BE APPROACH TO LOOK AT NEW

03:19:52.613 --> 03:19:54.615
CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES. THAT

03:19:54.682 --> 03:19:55.983
MIGHT BE AVAILABLE AND ALSO

03:19:56.050 --> 03:19:57.251
HOPEFULLY TO THINK ABOUT

03:19:57.318 --> 03:19:58.419
ALTERNATIVES THAT CAN MAKE

03:19:58.486 --> 03:20:01.155
SEGUE OUT PUBLIC SECTOR

03:20:01.222 --> 03:20:01.622
POWERSHOT OFFICE IN A

03:20:01.689 --> 03:20:03.558
REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. YOU

COUPLE OF DAYS TO BRING SAYS

03:22:10.618 --> 03:22:13.287
SYSTEMS BACK ONLINE. BUT WITH A

BRING ON THOSE PLANTS IT'S NOT

03:22:26.100 --> 03:22:27.068
JUST FLIPPING A SWITCH THERE'S

03:22:27.134 --> 03:22:28.970
A LOT TO IT. THERE ARE CERTAIN

03:22:29.036 --> 03:22:30.605
LARGER SYSTEMS WE WANT TO BRING

03:22:30.671 --> 03:22:33.007
ON FIRST. SO THAT OUR

03:22:33.074 --> 03:22:33.908
DEVELOPMENT OF MITIGATION

ANY WE HOPE WE CAN FURTHER

03:22:37.111 --> 03:22:38.646
REFINE THIS. BUT WE'RE PROBABLY

PHONE CALLS TO EACH OF THE

03:24:09.704 --> 03:24:10.338
PHONE NUMBERS ARE BILLING

PHONE NUMBERS TO MAKE SURE WE

03:24:15.309 --> 03:24:17.411
HAVE GOOD INFORMATION BUT-

03:24:17.478 --> 03:24:19.113
THAT'S ONLY ONE MEANS SOCIAL

03:24:19.180 --> 03:24:20.514
MEDIA IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER

03:24:20.581 --> 03:24:23.084
BIG PIECE OF THAT. BUT AGAIN.

03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:24.986
EARLY UNDERSTANDING OF THE

03:24:25.052 --> 03:24:26.187

PROBABLY GET. WE'RE NOT SURE

03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:33.561
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN YET OR

03:24:33.628 --> 03:24:40.167
NOT BUT. BE PREPARED. THE

03:24:40.234 --> 03:24:45.206
WEATHER'S CHANGING SO THANK YOU.

03:24:45.272 --> 03:24:46.140
YEAH IT FOR US WE'VE BEEN OUT

03:24:46.207 --> 03:24:47.141
REACHING AT ALREADY TO TRY TO

03:24:47.208 --> 03:24:48.242
HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:49.543
GOING TO HAPPEN. WE USE THE

03:24:49.610 --> 03:24:50.544
NEIGHBORHOOD NEXT DOOR HAS ONE

03:24:50.611 --> 03:24:51.145
COMMUNICATION VEHICLE WE HAVE

03:24:51.212 --> 03:24:52.046
SOCIAL MEDIA THAT WE EMPLOY WE

03:24:52.113 --> 03:24:52.847
HAVE OUR WEBSITE AS A GO TO

03:24:52.913 --> 03:24:54.215
PLACE. NOW WHEN PEOPLE IF THEY

03:24:54.281 --> 03:24:56.117
ARE EXPERIENCING ANY OUTAGES

03:24:56.183 --> 03:24:56.751
THAT'S WHERE THEY WOULD GO TO.

03:24:56.817 --> 03:24:58.786
OUR GOAL AT IT AS THE WATER

03:24:58.853 --> 03:25:00.087
SERVICE PROVIDERS TO AVOID THE

03:25:00.154 --> 03:25:02.256
OUTAGES. AND TO COMMUNICATE

03:25:02.323 --> 03:25:03.090
MORE BROADLY ABOUT THE NEED TO

03:25:03.157 --> 03:25:04.959
CONSERVE SO WE CAN PRESERVE.

03:25:05.026 --> 03:25:07.194
AND WE TOP UP EVERYTHING. WHEN

03:25:07.261 --> 03:25:08.195
WE GET A RED FLAG WARNING

03:25:08.262 --> 03:25:09.764
FILLABLE THE TANKS MOBILIZE THE

03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:12.767
GENERATORS. AND FUEL CONTRACTS

03:25:12.833 --> 03:25:13.367
OUR HOPE IS THAT WILL BE IN A

03:25:13.434 --> 03:25:13.934
POSITION WE'RE GOING TO KEEP

03:25:14.001 --> 03:25:16.804
EVERYTHING IN WATER. BUT IF IT

03:25:16.871 --> 03:25:17.672
TURNS OUT THAT WE HAVE ISOLATED

03:25:17.738 --> 03:25:20.775
AREAS WHERE. THINGS ARE HEADED

03:25:20.841 --> 03:25:21.676
TOWARDS D. PRESSURIZATION FOR

03:25:21.742 --> 03:25:23.210
REASONS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL.

03:25:23.277 --> 03:25:24.445
THEN WE HAVE MORE SURGICAL

03:25:24.512 --> 03:25:28.049
APPROACHES TO BE ABLE TO

03:25:28.115 --> 03:25:28.649
COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE

03:25:28.716 --> 03:25:32.420
CUSTOMERS THAT ARE IMPACTED SO.

03:25:32.486 --> 03:25:33.854
WE STAY BROAD WILL EMPLOY ALL

03:25:33.921 --> 03:25:34.955
OF OUR PRACTICES TO KEEP THE

03:25:35.022 --> 03:25:35.723
SYSTEM PRESSURIZED IN IN WATER.

03:25:35.790 --> 03:25:37.858
AND IF IT DOES TURN OUT THAT

03:25:37.925 --> 03:25:38.459
THIS GOES ON FOR TOO LONG AND

03:25:38.526 --> 03:25:39.760
WE SOMEHOW HAVE SOME PROBLEMS.

03:25:39.827 --> 03:25:41.595
THEN WILL TARGET THAT COMMUNITY

03:25:41.662 --> 03:25:42.096
AT TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

03:25:42.163 --> 03:25:48.502
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. VERY GOOD.

03:25:48.569 --> 03:25:51.272

HOPEFULLY ONE TABLE WHO WILL

03:25:57.278 --> 03:25:58.579
NEED ONE IS MISTER HASTINGS WAS

03:25:58.646 --> 03:25:59.480
TALKING YEAH I HOPE IT DOESN'T

03:25:59.547 --> 03:26:00.081
TAKE TILL NEXT YEAR TO FIGURE

03:26:00.147 --> 03:26:00.514
SOME OF THIS OUT AND

03:26:00.581 --> 03:26:03.951
UNFORTUNATELY. YOU KNOW I

YOU KNOW I THINK IT BE SOLVABLE

03:26:09.657 --> 03:26:11.959
THE PROBLEM IS. THERE'S

03:26:12.026 --> 03:26:12.760
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF I

03:26:12.827 --> 03:26:14.829
MEAN EVEN THE DESTROYED LOOK AT

03:26:14.895 --> 03:26:16.464
THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS

03:26:16.530 --> 03:26:19.133
SANTA SUZANNA MOUNTAINS WHERE-WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT. SORT OF

03:26:20.868 --> 03:26:21.769
THROUGHOUT THE NORTH SAN

FERNANDO VALLEY BREWERIES

03:26:23.671 --> 03:26:26.173
AEROSPACE YOU NAME IT FIND A

03:26:26.240 --> 03:26:28.409
REASON GAS FIELD BY THE WAY

03:26:28.476 --> 03:26:31.212
THAT NEEDS THE POWER ON TO

03:26:31.278 --> 03:26:34.582
MAINTAIN SOME SAFETY OUT THERE.

03:26:34.648 --> 03:26:39.386
AND IT'S ALL. IT'S ALL AT RISK

03:26:39.453 --> 03:26:42.289
I WANTED TO ASK MS CABINETS

03:26:42.356 --> 03:26:42.757
REALLY APPRECIATE THE

03:26:42.823 --> 03:26:44.391
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. I'M

03:26:44.458 --> 03:26:47.995
THIS MADE HERE THAT YOU CAN

03:26:48.062 --> 03:26:49.897
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION SINCE

03:26:49.964 --> 03:26:50.464
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND WE'RE

03:26:50.531 --> 03:26:52.500
HERE ELEVEN YEARS LATER AND THE

03:26:52.566 --> 03:26:55.336
SAME CONVERSATION IT'S

03:26:55.402 --> 03:26:57.905
APPALLING AND UNACCEPTABLE AND

03:26:57.972 --> 03:27:00.174
PEOPLE THAT YOU REPRESENT TOO

03:27:00.241 --> 03:27:02.543
OFTEN ARE LEFT BEHIND I'M GLAD

03:27:02.610 --> 03:27:04.912
THERE'S AN EMERGING COALITION

03:27:04.979 --> 03:27:05.513
HERE OF. YOU KNOW BIG INDUSTRY

03:27:05.579 --> 03:27:10.050
AND. PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO OFTEN

03:27:10.117 --> 03:27:11.786
HIDDEN FROM VIEW IN THAT WE ALL

03:27:11.852 --> 03:27:13.854
WE LEAVE BEHIND FAR TOO OFTEN I

03:27:13.921 --> 03:27:14.622
WANT TO GET A SENSE THOUGH HOW

03:27:14.688 --> 03:27:17.258
MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK. YOU

03:27:17.324 --> 03:27:17.992
WERE GETTING AT THIS ISSUE OF

03:27:18.058 --> 03:27:19.827
HOW DO YOU AREN'T BEING COUNTED

03:27:19.894 --> 03:27:20.961
YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF

03:27:21.028 --> 03:27:22.496
THE POPULATION THAT'S TRULY

03:27:22.563 --> 03:27:24.732
RISK HERE YOU MENTIONED A F. N.

03:27:24.799 --> 03:27:27.902
AS A SORT OF DESIGNATION.

03:27:27.968 --> 03:27:29.537
ACCESS FUNCTIONAL NEEDS

03:27:29.603 --> 03:27:34.308
HOUSEHOLDS. I THINK OBVIOUSLY

03:27:34.375 --> 03:27:35.176
COULD BE BROADER THAN NAPA GIVE

03:27:35.242 --> 03:27:36.210
A SENSE OF SORT OF COMPARING

03:27:36.277 --> 03:27:36.744
WHAT YOU SEE IN A MINUTE

03:27:36.811 --> 03:27:39.046
MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMER.

03:27:39.113 --> 03:27:41.749
NUMBER'S VERSES WHAT YOU SEE IN

03:27:41.816 --> 03:27:43.717
THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND

03:27:43.784 --> 03:27:47.454
WHAT THE GAP COULD BE. I WISH I

03:27:47.521 --> 03:27:49.256
HAD BETTER NUMBERS FOR YOU BUT

03:27:49.323 --> 03:27:49.890
I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU CONCEPTS IN

03:27:49.957 --> 03:27:53.327
RESPONSE. A MEDICAL BASS LINE

03:27:53.394 --> 03:27:56.030
IS ONLY A TINY FRACTION OF THE

03:27:56.096 --> 03:27:57.832
VULNERABLE AT RISK HOUSEHOLDS

03:27:57.898 --> 03:27:58.399
AND IT'S NOT INTENDED AS WAS

03:27:58.465 --> 03:28:02.236
MENTIONED EARLIER. TODAY AS AN

03:28:02.303 --> 03:28:05.506
EMERGENCY DESIGNATION MEDICAL

03:28:05.573 --> 03:28:06.073
BASELINE AT ITS ESSENCE IS A

03:28:06.140 --> 03:28:10.444
RATE. IT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE

03:28:10.511 --> 03:28:12.179
ADDITIONAL ELECTRICITY AT A

03:28:12.246 --> 03:28:14.081
LOWER RATE FOR PEOPLE WHOSE

03:28:14.148 --> 03:28:17.051
USAGE IS DRIVEN BY MEDICAL NEED.

03:28:17.117 --> 03:28:18.686
AND THAT'S VERY APPRECIATED BUT

03:28:18.752 --> 03:28:20.988
IT'S NOT AN IDENTIFIER FOR

03:28:21.055 --> 03:28:21.589
PEOPLE WHO RELY ON ELECTRICITY

03:28:21.655 --> 03:28:24.358
FOR HEALTH. JUST TO GIVE THE

03:28:24.425 --> 03:28:26.627
MOST SIMPLE EXAMPLE THE PEOPLE

03:28:26.694 --> 03:28:27.261
WHO RELY ON REFER TRADING THEIR

03:28:27.328 --> 03:28:29.597
MEDICATION. IT DOESN'T DRIVE

03:28:29.663 --> 03:28:33.200
ADDITIONAL ENERGY USAGE. AND

03:28:33.267 --> 03:28:33.701
YET THEIR HEALTH IS VERY

03:28:33.767 --> 03:28:38.572
DEPENDENT ON RELIABLE ENERGY SO.

03:28:38.639 --> 03:28:42.710
THEN YOU ADD TO THAT THAT. EVEN

03:28:42.776 --> 03:28:43.911
FOR THE POPULATION THAT WOULD

03:28:43.978 --> 03:28:45.946
BE ELIGIBLE MEDICAL BASELINE IS

03:28:46.013 --> 03:28:47.047
SEEMS TO BE VERY UNDER

03:28:47.114 --> 03:28:49.617
SUBSCRIBED AND THE CPUC HAS

03:28:49.683 --> 03:28:51.051
JUST FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER

03:28:51.118 --> 03:28:53.454
REALLY MANDATED THAT THE

03:28:53.520 --> 03:28:56.056
UTILITIES DO A MORE AGGRESSIVE

03:28:56.123 --> 03:28:58.058
OUTREACH PROGRAM TO ATTEMPT TO

03:28:58.125 --> 03:28:58.559
ENROLL PEOPLE IN MEDICAL

03:28:58.626 --> 03:29:01.328
BASELINE. ON THE OTHER

03:29:01.395 --> 03:29:05.032
REPRESENTATIVES OF. PERHAPS THE

03:29:05.099 --> 03:29:05.733
MAYOR WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

03:29:05.799 --> 03:29:08.035
PLACE TO SPEAK TO THIS CITIES

03:29:08.102 --> 03:29:11.872
AND COUNTIES HAVE REGISTRIES OF

03:29:11.939 --> 03:29:13.607
HOUSEHOLDS THAT THEY MAINTAIN

03:29:13.674 --> 03:29:17.044
FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS OF

03:29:17.111 --> 03:29:19.280
MEDICALLY FRAGILE I'M MORE OR

03:29:19.346 --> 03:29:21.415
OTHERWISE IDENTIFIED VULNERABLE

03:29:21.482 --> 03:29:24.785
OF CUSTOMERS ARE RESIDENTS AND

03:29:24.852 --> 03:29:26.220
THOSE ARE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE

03:29:26.287 --> 03:29:27.588
LARGER THAN THE MEDICAL

03:29:27.655 --> 03:29:30.591
BASELINE POPULATION SO ON THIS

03:29:30.658 --> 03:29:33.327
SOME STRUCTURE TO COORDINATE

03:29:33.394 --> 03:29:34.762
BETWEEN THE UTILITIES AND

03:29:34.828 --> 03:29:37.798
COUNTIES TO EXCHANGE THOSE

03:29:37.865 --> 03:29:38.732
LISTS AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE

03:29:38.799 --> 03:29:42.169
CONCERNS ABOUT HIPPA. AND OTHER

03:29:42.236 --> 03:29:45.372
PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS SO I DON'T

03:29:45.439 --> 03:29:47.241
KNOW HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE BUT

03:29:47.308 --> 03:29:48.742
THAT WOULD CERTAINLY EXPAND THE

03:29:48.809 --> 03:29:51.512
UNIVERSE AND ONE POSSIBILITY

03:29:51.578 --> 03:29:53.147
THAT I'VE RAISED AT CPAC

03:29:53.213 --> 03:29:56.617
HEARINGS IS THE UTILITY IS

03:29:56.684 --> 03:29:59.486
PROVIDING INFORMATION AND THEN

03:29:59.553 --> 03:30:02.122
RESOURCES TO COUNTIES SO THAT

03:30:02.189 --> 03:30:03.057
THE COUNTIES COULD USE THEIR

03:30:03.123 --> 03:30:05.259
OWN LISTS WHICH WOULD AVOID THE

03:30:05.326 --> 03:30:06.794
NEED FOR ACTUALLY EXCHANGING

03:30:06.860 --> 03:30:08.629
INFORMATION BUT WOULDN'T SHIFT

03:30:08.696 --> 03:30:09.663
THE BURDEN ENTIRELY TO THE

03:30:09.730 --> 03:30:13.834
COUNTIES. TO NOW TAKE ON THIS

03:30:13.901 --> 03:30:20.774
NOTIFICATION PROCESS. AGAIN I

03:30:20.841 --> 03:30:21.642
AM WORKING IN THE ABSTRACT I

03:30:21.709 --> 03:30:22.276
DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD REALLY

03:30:22.343 --> 03:30:23.210
HELP THAT'S THE CONCEPT OF THE

03:30:23.277 --> 03:30:23.811
UTILITIES PROVIDE THE

03:30:23.877 --> 03:30:25.813
RESOURCES. AND THE LOCAL

03:30:25.879 --> 03:30:26.413
GOVERNMENTS USE THEIR EXISTING

03:30:26.480 --> 03:30:27.681
IDENTIFIERS OF VULNERABLE

03:30:27.748 --> 03:30:30.351
HOUSEHOLDS AS A PRIORITY LIST I

03:30:30.417 --> 03:30:32.686
THINK IT'S IS THE SMART IDEA

03:30:32.753 --> 03:30:37.791
AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY SELF.

03:30:37.858 --> 03:30:39.827
WELL AS A SUPPLEMENT IT

03:30:39.893 --> 03:30:40.661
CERTAINLY SHOULD BE RELIED ON

03:30:40.728 --> 03:30:44.098
AS WE ARE NOW BUT I DO THINK

03:30:44.164 --> 03:30:44.631
PEOPLE WOULD BE MUCH MORE

03:30:44.698 --> 03:30:45.199
WILLING TO SELF IDENTIFY IF

03:30:45.265 --> 03:30:47.334
THEY KNEW. THERE COULD BE SOME

03:30:47.401 --> 03:30:48.936
BENEFIT OF THEM DOING SO IN

03:30:49.003 --> 03:30:50.270
OTHER WORDS THAT THERE MIGHT BE

03:30:50.337 --> 03:30:53.040
A SOLUTION SO. IF YOU ARE

03:30:53.107 --> 03:30:54.641
LIVING IN A NURSING ASSISTANT

03:30:54.708 --> 03:30:56.110
FACILITY AND YOU KNOW THA IF

03:30:56.176 --> 03:30:58.312
YOU AND YOUR FELLOW RESIDENTS

03:30:58.379 --> 03:30:59.413
WHO LIVE THERE MIGHT BE

03:30:59.480 --> 03:31:01.682
ELIGIBLE FOR. A DISCOUNT ON A

03:31:01.749 --> 03:31:03.884
SOLAR BATTERY YSTEM TO BE

03:31:03.951 --> 03:31:05.853
INSTALLED IF YOU GUYS JUST SIGN

03:31:05.919 --> 03:31:08.856
UP AND CLICK ON. ON POWER DOWN

03:31:08.922 --> 03:31:10.958
NOW THERE'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING

03:31:11.025 --> 03:31:12.993
TO SAY LIKE YES WE HAVE A NEED

03:31:13.060 --> 03:31:14.528
PEOPLE MIGHT ACTUALLY STEP

03:31:14.595 --> 03:31:16.497
FORWARD AND START IDENTIFYING

03:31:16.563 --> 03:31:18.232
THEMSELVES I KNOW I MEAN I

03:31:18.298 --> 03:31:19.933
THINK OF WHAT. THE MTA COULD DO

03:31:20.000 --> 03:31:22.236
SORT OF MORE COMPREHENSIVELY TO

03:31:22.302 --> 03:31:23.771
ADDRESS YOUR VULNERABLE NEEDS

03:31:23.837 --> 03:31:25.472
AND I LIKE I'M REALLY GLAD YOU

03:31:25.539 --> 03:31:27.674
GOT THAT PROCESS STARTED THAT

03:31:27.741 --> 03:31:29.176
INVENTORY IN BECAUSE IT'S- IT'S

03:31:29.243 --> 03:31:30.711
EASIER TO COORDINATE. A BUNCH

03:31:30.778 --> 03:31:32.146
OF YOU KNOW SORT OF LARGE

03:31:32.212 --> 03:31:34.348
CRITICAL INDUSTRIES MUCH HARDER

03:31:34.415 --> 03:31:36.050
HERE SOMEONE FROM MISTER MURDER

03:31:36.116 --> 03:31:38.385
SHAW. I MEAN HOW QUICKLY COULD

03:31:38.452 --> 03:31:42.056
YOU GO TO A CLIENT LIKE ONE OF

03:31:42.122 --> 03:31:44.158
THESE AFN HOUSEHOLDS AND GET

03:31:44.224 --> 03:31:47.194
UP. SMALL SCALE NOT BIG ENOUGH

03:31:47.261 --> 03:31:48.495
TO NECESSARILY HANDLE A CEMENT

03:31:48.562 --> 03:31:50.664
PLANT BUT SMALL ENOUGH TO

03:31:50.731 --> 03:31:51.999
HANDLE YOUR TEN PEOPLE LIVING

03:31:52.066 --> 03:31:53.300
IN NURSING IS ASSISTED

03:31:53.367 --> 03:31:57.671
FACILITY. HOW QUICKLY COULD YOU

03:31:57.738 --> 03:31:58.272
GET A SOLAR STORAGE PROJECT UP

03:31:58.338 --> 03:32:03.610
AND RUNNING. BARRING ANY

03:32:03.677 --> 03:32:04.378
COMPLICATIONS WITH THE

03:32:04.445 --> 03:32:07.114
INTERACTION OR THE APPROVAL BY

03:32:07.181 --> 03:32:08.615
THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. REMARKS

03:32:08.682 --> 03:32:09.716
AT FOR YOU OKAY LET'S

03:32:09.783 --> 03:32:12.386
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU CAN BE

03:32:12.453 --> 03:32:12.953
ANYWHERE FROM FROM WEEKS TO

03:32:13.020 --> 03:32:14.922
MONTHS. BUT FOR SMALLER SYSTEMS

03:32:14.988 --> 03:32:15.489
IT'S USUALLY ON THE ORDER OF

03:32:15.556 --> 03:32:17.424
JUST A FEW MONTHS. AND SO ARE

03:32:17.491 --> 03:32:19.827
YOU AWARE OF. SO THEY ARE

03:32:19.893 --> 03:32:21.195
THEY'RE IMPEDIMENTS IN OTHER

03:32:21.261 --> 03:32:22.729
WORDS TO GETTING THOSE SOLAR

03:32:22.796 --> 03:32:24.465
STORAGE SYSTEM SAY UP AND

03:32:24.531 --> 03:32:25.999
RUNNING IN FOR CUSTOMERS LIKE

03:32:26.066 --> 03:32:30.804
THAT TO INTERCONNECT. GENERALLY

03:32:30.871 --> 03:32:31.371
WHAT WE HEAR FROM OUR MEMBER

03:32:31.438 --> 03:32:34.074
COMPANIES IS THAT BECAUSE

03:32:34.141 --> 03:32:35.476
STORAGE IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW

03:32:35.542 --> 03:32:37.144
TECHNOLOGY THAT THERE ARE A LOT

03:32:37.211 --> 03:32:39.513
OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHO.

03:32:39.580 --> 03:32:42.249
HAVE JUST AND ARE VERY SLOW TO

03:32:42.316 --> 03:32:43.617
APPROVE THE PERMITS EITHER

03:32:43.684 --> 03:32:45.552
DON'T HAVE. OTHER QUALIFIED

03:32:45.619 --> 03:32:47.421
PERSONNEL OR DON'T BELIEVE THEY

03:32:47.488 --> 03:32:48.689
HAVE QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO GO

03:32:48.755 --> 03:32:50.924
OUT BECAUSE OF THE SUDDEN

03:32:50.991 --> 03:32:51.492
ACCELERATION THE ADOPTION OF

03:32:51.558 --> 03:32:55.062
STORAGE. SO JUST GETTING THE

03:32:55.129 --> 03:32:56.330
PERMITS APPROVED HAS BEEN A

03:32:56.396 --> 03:32:58.365
CHALLENGE AND THEN FOR LARGER

03:32:58.432 --> 03:32:59.967
SYSTEMS MAY BE A SYSTEM SERVING

03:33:00.033 --> 03:33:02.736
A LARGE S. ASSISTED LIVING

03:33:02.803 --> 03:33:05.806
FACILITY OR NURSING HOME. THAT.

03:33:05.873 --> 03:33:07.374
YOU THEN CAN RUN INTO

03:33:07.441 --> 03:33:08.275
INTERACTION CHALLENGES WITH

03:33:08.342 --> 03:33:10.944
UTILITY BECAUSE UTILITY. BEING

03:33:11.011 --> 03:33:12.646
CONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATIONS THEY

03:33:12.713 --> 03:33:14.281
WANT TO ANALYZE THE IMPACTS OF

03:33:14.348 --> 03:33:16.150
THE STORAGE UNIT ASSUMING THE

03:33:16.216 --> 03:33:17.084
WORST CASE SCENARIO THAT IT

03:33:17.151 --> 03:33:18.919
CHARGES AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE

03:33:18.986 --> 03:33:20.220
AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. AND

03:33:20.287 --> 03:33:24.825
VICE VERSA. SO THAT OFTEN

03:33:24.892 --> 03:33:25.425
ENTAILS A COMPLEX ENGINEERING

03:33:25.492 --> 03:33:29.229
REVIEW. SO WOULD STREAMLINED

03:33:29.296 --> 03:33:31.031
PERMITTING PROCESS SEES THOUGH

03:33:31.098 --> 03:33:31.632
HELP ESPECIALLY WITH HONORABLE

03:33:31.698 --> 03:33:34.902
POPULATIONS YES. AND SO LAST

03:33:34.968 --> 03:33:36.603
QUESTION HERE IS THAT THERE'S A

03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:37.938
PERMITTING ELEMENT IS SORT OF

03:33:38.005 --> 03:33:40.140
THE COORDINATION CYBER THERE'S

03:33:40.207 --> 03:33:41.108
ALSO FINANCING ON IT THESE

03:33:41.175 --> 03:33:43.177
THINGS COST MONEY AND EVERYONE

03:33:43.243 --> 03:33:44.411
SENSITIVE TO ADDING MORE

03:33:44.478 --> 03:33:45.646
PRESSURE ON TO THE RATE BASE OF

03:33:45.712 --> 03:33:48.715
COURSE AND I GET THAT BOTH FORD

03:33:48.782 --> 03:33:49.850
LARGE INDUSTRIAL USERS AS WELL

03:33:49.917 --> 03:33:51.018
AS- YOU KNOW FIXED INCOME AND

03:33:51.084 --> 03:33:53.420
USERS. ARE THERE OTHER REVENUE

03:33:53.487 --> 03:33:55.489
STREAMS THAT WE CAN BE LOOKING

03:33:55.556 --> 03:33:57.291
TO BEYOND THE RATE BASE TO HELP

03:33:57.357 --> 03:33:58.425
SUPPLEMENT AND I'M THINKING

03:33:58.492 --> 03:34:01.061
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HEALTH

03:34:01.128 --> 03:34:07.801
INSURANCE OR OTHER I. MEAN

03:34:07.868 --> 03:34:08.335
CERTAINLY ON AN IN IS IN A

03:34:08.402 --> 03:34:11.772
HAVE. ANY HOW DO WE GET

03:34:11.838 --> 03:34:12.272
CREATIVE ABOUT COBBLING

03:34:12.339 --> 03:34:13.073
TOGETHER FINANCING BECAUSE I.

03:34:13.140 --> 03:34:13.941
I'D LIKE TO SEE A WILLINGNESS

03:34:14.007 --> 03:34:14.641
FROM HIS LEGISLATURE TO STEP

03:34:14.708 --> 03:34:16.343
UP. AND PUT A CHUNK OF FUNDING

03:34:16.410 --> 03:34:17.711
FOR BEYOND THAT SEVENTY FIVE

03:34:17.778 --> 03:34:18.745
MILLION FOR STATE FACILITIES

03:34:18.812 --> 03:34:20.981
FOR BACKUP POWER. TO REALLY DO

03:34:21.048 --> 03:34:22.749
SOMETHING BIG HERE BUT- HOW DO

03:34:22.816 --> 03:34:24.451
WE SORT OF. WHAT IS THE PRIVATE

03:34:24.518 --> 03:34:25.319
STE WHAT COULD THE PRIVATE

03:34:25.385 --> 03:34:27.154
STAKE LOOK LIKE IN THERE HOW

03:34:27.221 --> 03:34:28.689
COULD WE PULL IN POTENTIALLY

03:34:28.755 --> 03:34:29.723
OTHER CREATIVE REVENUE STREAMS

03:34:29.790 --> 03:34:32.259
AND REALLY START TO. AT LEAST.

03:34:32.326 --> 03:34:34.061
ELISE GET MOVING RIGHT WE MAKE

03:34:34.127 --> 03:34:36.763
A BILL TO COVER EVERYONE AT

03:34:36.830 --> 03:34:37.331
LEAST TO GET STARTED ANY ANY

03:34:37.397 --> 03:34:39.299
THOUGHTS MISCAST. THIS IS NOT

03:34:39.366 --> 03:34:40.434
MY AREA OF EXPERTISE AND SO ALL

03:34:40.500 --> 03:34:42.002
I CAN TELL YOU IS STUFF THAT

03:34:42.069 --> 03:34:43.770
I'VE BEEN READING OVER THE LAST

03:34:43.837 --> 03:34:46.240
FEW DAYS. BUT THERE IS.

03:34:46.306 --> 03:34:49.543
CERTAINLY INTEREST AND.

03:34:49.610 --> 03:34:51.378
MOVEMENT THAT I'M AWARE OF

03:34:51.445 --> 03:34:54.348
ABOUT TRYING TO WORK WITH THE

03:34:54.414 --> 03:34:55.549
LARGE PUBLIC INSURERS MEDICARE

03:34:55.616 --> 03:34:58.885
AND MEDICAID NOW. TO SEE IF

03:34:58.952 --> 03:35:00.420
THERE COULD BE OPTIONS FOR

03:35:00.487 --> 03:35:02.923
COVERAGE ON THE SAME WAY YOU

03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.757
WOULD COVER FOR EXAMPLE DURABLE

03:35:03.824 --> 03:35:05.892
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. TO SAY

03:35:05.959 --> 03:35:07.928
SOMEONE WHO NEEDS THAT

03:35:07.995 --> 03:35:08.428
EQUIPMENT ALSO NEEDS THE

03:35:08.495 --> 03:35:08.929
ABILITY TO SUSTAIN THAT

03:35:08.996 --> 03:35:11.331
EQUIPMENT. DURING A TIME OF

03:35:11.398 --> 03:35:13.934
DESTRUCTION I DO NOT PERSONALLY

03:35:14.001 --> 03:35:15.902
HAVE INFORMATION ON WHETHER

03:35:15.969 --> 03:35:18.572
THIS HAS ACTUALLY MOVED BEYOND

03:35:18.639 --> 03:35:20.874
THE BRAINSTORMING STAGE AND

03:35:20.941 --> 03:35:21.875
WHETHER THERE'S WORK ACTUALLY

03:35:21.942 --> 03:35:24.211
UNDER WAY BUT I DO KNOW AT

03:35:24.278 --> 03:35:28.615
LEAST IT IS. A CONCEPT THAT IS

03:35:28.682 --> 03:35:29.149
THE SUBJECT OF THE INITIAL

03:35:29.216 --> 03:35:33.220
DISCUSSION. RIGHT WE LOVE TO

03:35:33.287 --> 03:35:35.656
FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT AND

03:35:35.722 --> 03:35:38.558
IS AND IS FAR FROM LIKE A CITY

03:35:38.625 --> 03:35:41.295
OR- AT THE MUNICIPAL UTILITY

03:35:41.361 --> 03:35:44.665
PERSPECTIVE. YOUR YOUR RATE

03:35:44.731 --> 03:35:46.566
BASE IS OR YOUR RATE BASE OR

03:35:46.633 --> 03:35:48.302
YOUR MARGINS HE SERVICES

03:35:48.368 --> 03:35:49.503
BUDGETS AND ARE THESE THINGS%

03:35:49.569 --> 03:35:50.871
YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IN

03:35:50.937 --> 03:35:52.973
TERMS OF HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY

03:35:53.040 --> 03:35:54.241
EVEN AT A MUNICIPAL LEVEL WHAT

03:35:54.308 --> 03:35:56.209
YOU'RE CRITICAL ASSETS ARE AND

03:35:56.276 --> 03:35:57.311
WHAT YOU CAN BE DOING NOTE TO

03:35:57.377 --> 03:35:58.812
BACKSTOP THAT OR EVEN WITHIN

03:35:58.879 --> 03:36:00.547
EAST BAY MUD I MEAN. YOU'RE

03:36:00.614 --> 03:36:02.416
ALSO I MEAN WATER DISTRICTS

03:36:02.482 --> 03:36:03.550
AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:36:03.617 --> 03:36:04.818
WASTE DISTRICTS EVERYONE'S

03:36:04.885 --> 03:36:06.420
LIABLE ALSO POTENTIALLY WE

03:36:06.486 --> 03:36:08.655
HAVING LAWSUITS AGAINST LOCAL

03:36:08.722 --> 03:36:10.691
WATER DISTRICTS IN VENTURA

03:36:10.757 --> 03:36:11.825
COUNTY RIGHT NOW AFTER THOMAS

03:36:11.892 --> 03:36:14.361

BE HELD LIABLE FOR HUNDREDS OF

03:36:22.436 --> 03:36:23.737
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIRE

03:36:23.804 --> 03:36:25.806
DAMAGE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET

03:36:25.872 --> 03:36:27.074
THEIR PUMP SYSTEMS GOING SO HOW

03:36:27.140 --> 03:36:31.044
PROACTIVE. ART ARE YOU GUYS

03:36:31.111 --> 03:36:32.245
ABLE TO GET IN TERMS OF GETTING

03:36:32.312 --> 03:36:33.947
YOUR BUT YOU'RE SORT OF EITHER

03:36:34.014 --> 03:36:35.749
RATE BASED OR GENERAL FUND

03:36:35.816 --> 03:36:40.354
HEADED SOME. OF THE STUFF SO

03:36:40.420 --> 03:36:40.987
YOU DON'T SEE THOSE BIG FAILURE

03:36:41.054 --> 03:36:47.828
POINTS. THE PER HEALDSBURG

03:36:47.894 --> 03:36:48.428
YOU'RE MORE THAN A DECADE AGO

03:36:48.495 --> 03:36:49.262
THE CITY MAN AN EFFORT TO PUT

03:36:49.329 --> 03:36:49.896
BACK UP GENERATION AND ALL OF

03:36:49.963 --> 03:36:50.831
OUR CRITICAL FACILITIES FOR

03:36:50.897 --> 03:36:51.331
POLICE DEPARTMENT FIRE

WATER FACILITIES WASTE WATER

03:36:54.101 --> 03:36:54.968
FACILITIES SO WE HAVE A LOT OF

03:36:55.035 --> 03:36:55.836
BACKUP GENERATION IT'S DIESEL

03:36:55.902 --> 03:36:58.238
IT'S NOT CLEAN BUT IS THERE AND

03:36:58.305 --> 03:36:59.139
AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN

03:36:59.206 --> 03:37:00.774
PRODUCE WATER INTRIGUE WATER

03:37:00.841 --> 03:37:02.075
AND THEN WE HAVE A FLEET OF

03:37:02.142 --> 03:37:03.844
BOWL GENERATION THAT WE RUN

03:37:03.910 --> 03:37:04.745
AROUND TO OUR VARIOUS

03:37:04.811 --> 03:37:06.780
COLLECTIONS STATIONS PUMP

03:37:06.847 --> 03:37:08.315
STATIONS TO KEEP THAT WATER

03:37:08.382 --> 03:37:12.119
WASTEWATER. FACILITIES GOING

03:37:12.185 --> 03:37:15.522
YOU KNOW IT IS DIESEL. TO BE

03:37:15.589 --> 03:37:15.989
NICE TO HAVE A CLEANER

03:37:16.056 --> 03:37:16.590
TECHNOLOGY I MEAN THE CONCEPT

03:37:16.656 --> 03:37:18.191
OF BATTERY STORAGE IS A GREAT

03:37:18.258 --> 03:37:21.061
IDEA. IN IN THE FACT THAT YOU

03:37:21.128 --> 03:37:22.462
POTENTIALLY COULD USE A BETTER

03:37:22.529 --> 03:37:23.897
STORAGE YEAR ROUND VERSUS JUST

03:37:23.964 --> 03:37:26.199
A ONE TIME EVENT. WERE BACK OF

03:37:26.266 --> 03:37:27.467
DIESEL GENERATION IT DOESN'T DO

03:37:27.534 --> 03:37:28.668
ANYTHING UNLESS YOU HOW THE

03:37:28.735 --> 03:37:30.270
EVENT GOING ON THERE BUT- AGAIN

03:37:30.337 --> 03:37:32.372
THE COST OF BATTERY STORAGE AND

03:37:32.439 --> 03:37:33.640
THE SIZE OF THE UNIT SO WE

03:37:33.707 --> 03:37:35.842
WOULD HAVE TO PUT INTO SUSTAIN

03:37:35.909 --> 03:37:39.079
A FOUR DAY FIVE DAY. OUTAGE

03:37:39.146 --> 03:37:40.113
THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO

03:37:40.180 --> 03:37:42.983
OVERCOME. SO WE DISCUSS REPAIRS

03:37:43.049 --> 03:37:45.752
GENERAL FUND LIMITATIONS. THERE

03:37:45.819 --> 03:37:48.555
WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME OTHER

03:37:48.622 --> 03:37:49.122
FUNDING SOURCE TO MAKE THAT

03:37:49.189 --> 03:37:54.261
HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. AND THEN. IT

03:37:54.327 --> 03:37:54.861
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT MICROGRAPH

03:37:54.928 --> 03:37:56.363
PERTINENTES AS WELL FOR FIRE

03:37:56.430 --> 03:37:57.464
STATIONS I KNOW WE'VE HAD A FEW

03:37:57.531 --> 03:37:58.298
LA FIRE STATIONS THAT THE

03:37:58.365 --> 03:37:59.433
PORTER RANCH AREA THEY JUST

03:37:59.499 --> 03:38:00.567
GOTTA MICROGRAPH OF YOU GUYS

03:38:00.634 --> 03:38:02.235
START LOOKING AT THAT. SO I DID

03:38:02.302 --> 03:38:03.236
FALL SOME THE ARTICLES THAT

03:38:03.303 --> 03:38:05.071
WERE ON THE FIRE STATION IN THE

03:38:05.138 --> 03:38:06.540
MICRO GET THOSE PUT IN THERE

03:38:06.606 --> 03:38:07.174
AND THERE WAS OF A FAIRLY LARGE

03:38:07.240 --> 03:38:08.975
GRANITIC FROM THE CDC. THAT

03:38:09.042 --> 03:38:12.045
THAT SUPPORTED THAT OPPORTUNITY

03:38:12.112 --> 03:38:12.979
I'M NOT SURE THE SIZE OF THAT

03:38:13.046 --> 03:38:14.414
BATTERY SYSTEM AND WITH THAT

03:38:14.481 --> 03:38:16.716
SUSTAIN ANOTHER FOUR DAYS OF

03:38:16.783 --> 03:38:18.084
SHUT DOWN I MEAN THAT'S THE

03:38:18.151 --> 03:38:19.986
REAL CHALLENGES. A LOT OF THE

03:38:20.053 --> 03:38:21.455
YOU KNOW IT HAS A WALL PACK AND

03:38:21.521 --> 03:38:23.757
THOSE ARE REALLY. TWO TO FOUR

03:38:23.824 --> 03:38:27.727
TO SIX HOURS AND WE'RE TALKING

03:38:27.794 --> 03:38:30.564
ABOUT DAYS. OF OUTAGES AND SO.

03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:32.365
REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:38:32.432 --> 03:38:33.166
WE'RE WE'RE FINDING THE RIGHT

03:38:33.233 --> 03:38:33.967
SOLUTION FOR THE- FOR THE

03:38:34.034 --> 03:38:36.837
PROBLEM YOU'LL CELLS. YOU'LL

03:38:36.903 --> 03:38:37.637
CELLS AS AN OPTION YOU KNOW

03:38:37.704 --> 03:38:38.972
SWITCHING FROM. DIESEL BACK UP

03:38:39.039 --> 03:38:41.741
TO NATURAL GAS THE CHALLENGE

03:38:41.808 --> 03:38:42.342
THAT WE HAVE WITH NATURAL GAS

03:38:42.409 --> 03:38:44.010
IS DURING THE SENATE ROSE FIRES.

03:38:44.077 --> 03:38:44.644
OUR ENTIRE CITY LOS NATURAL GAS

03:38:44.711 --> 03:38:48.648
SERVICE. MY LAST COMMUNICATION

03:38:48.715 --> 03:38:51.685
LESS NATURAL GAS SERVICES SO

03:38:51.751 --> 03:38:52.285
EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T NESTLE

03:38:52.352 --> 03:38:54.287
AFFECTED DIRECTLY BY THE FIRES

03:38:54.354 --> 03:38:56.690
THOSE SERVICES WERE GONE DURING

03:38:56.756 --> 03:38:58.291
THAT TWO TO THREE DAY PERIOD.

03:38:58.358 --> 03:39:01.194
SO DEAL FUELING DURING THOSE

03:39:01.261 --> 03:39:03.296
BACK UP SITUATION IS CERTAINLY

03:39:03.363 --> 03:39:04.464
A MAJOR FOR DIESEL SIMILAR IS A

03:39:04.531 --> 03:39:05.432
SIMILAR ISSUE IN MY STUPID

03:39:05.499 --> 03:39:07.834
ANALOGY OF ME WITH A PICK UP

03:39:07.901 --> 03:39:09.236
TRUCK CONVOY TRYING TO GET OUT

03:39:09.302 --> 03:39:11.304
PCH WITH A BUNCH OF. RED YOU

03:39:11.371 --> 03:39:13.740
KNOW PLASTIC JUGS OF DIESEL BUT

03:39:13.807 --> 03:39:14.341
I MEAN THAT'S WHAT IT COMES

03:39:14.407 --> 03:39:15.509
DOWN THAT'S THE REALITY OF IT

03:39:15.575 --> 03:39:16.843
AND WE HAD SENATOR MCGUIRE

03:39:16.910 --> 03:39:18.345
MAKING PHONE CALLS TO FEELING

03:39:18.411 --> 03:39:19.412
COMPANIES TO GET FUEL INTO

03:39:19.479 --> 03:39:21.014
HEALDSBURG SO THAT WE COULD

03:39:21.081 --> 03:39:24.584
CONTINUE. TO RUN THROUGH THOSE

03:39:24.651 --> 03:39:27.954
PROCESSES BUT. YEAH I THINK I

03:39:28.021 --> 03:39:29.556
THINK BETTER SORTS NEEDS TO BE

03:39:29.623 --> 03:39:30.190
CONSIDERED AS PART OF SOLUTION

03:39:30.257 --> 03:39:30.724
BUT I THINK THERE FUNDING

03:39:30.790 --> 03:39:32.459
THERE'S NEEDS TO BE FUNDING OR

03:39:32.526 --> 03:39:34.895
SOME SIGNIFICANT COST REDUCTION.

03:39:34.961 --> 03:39:37.797
REALLY BRIEFLY MEXICO JUST YES

03:39:37.864 --> 03:39:41.067
WELL THANK YOU FOR ASKING SO I

03:39:41.134 --> 03:39:42.536
IS IT RELATES TO THE BACK OF

03:39:42.602 --> 03:39:45.839
POWER WE WENT WITH DIESEL FOR

03:39:45.906 --> 03:39:48.141
THE PORTABLE APPROACH TO

03:39:48.208 --> 03:39:50.277
DEALING WITH A HUNDRED THIRTY

03:39:50.343 --> 03:39:50.877
FIVE I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WERE

03:39:50.944 --> 03:39:51.478
HERE I SO WE ARE UNDER THIRTY

03:39:51.545 --> 03:39:53.547
FIVE PUMP. HI AT OUR-

03:39:53.613 --> 03:39:54.614
MAIN FACILITIES LIKE OUR WASTE

03:39:54.681 --> 03:39:55.982
WATER TREATMENT PLANT WILL THAT

03:39:56.049 --> 03:39:58.251
WE HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE THAT

03:39:58.318 --> 03:39:59.819
TO. COULD BE RUN ENTIRELY ON

03:39:59.886 --> 03:40:00.854
RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT WE

03:40:00.921 --> 03:40:02.355
GENERATE AT THE PLANT SO WE

03:40:02.422 --> 03:40:04.124
THINK THAT THAT IS A PRETTY

03:40:04.190 --> 03:40:06.259
SAFE OPERATION. AT OUR WASTE

03:40:06.326 --> 03:40:06.893
WHAT ARE EXCUSE ME IN OUR WATER

03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:07.994
TREATMENT PLANTS SO WHICH WE

03:40:08.061 --> 03:40:10.564
HAVE A NUMBER. ADD THOSE ALSO

03:40:10.630 --> 03:40:12.566
HAVE YOU KNOW STATIONARY

03:40:12.632 --> 03:40:13.533
GENERATORS THAT WE HAVE

03:40:13.600 --> 03:40:16.102
ABSOLUTELY. FEEL COMFORTABLE

03:40:16.169 --> 03:40:17.671
THAT WILL BE IN A POSITION TO

03:40:17.737 --> 03:40:19.539
KEEP THEM RUNNING. WE HAVE

03:40:19.606 --> 03:40:20.941
REFINERS IN THE SERVICE AREA WE

03:40:21.007 --> 03:40:23.476
HAVE ARRANGEMENTS PURCHASE

03:40:23.543 --> 03:40:27.247
ORDERS A PRE ESTABLISHED TO BE

03:40:27.314 --> 03:40:27.847
ABLE TO GET THE DIESEL THAT WE

03:40:27.914 --> 03:40:32.485
NEED FOR OUR. GENERATOR SYSTEMS

03:40:32.552 --> 03:40:33.353
IF YOU'RE A CREATIVE DISTRICT

03:40:33.420 --> 03:40:34.087
YOU'VE BEEN DOING PATH BREAKING

03:40:34.154 --> 03:40:35.422
WORK ON WASTE WATER TO ENERGY

03:40:35.488 --> 03:40:38.091
AND EVER WASTE ENERGY AND- I

03:40:38.158 --> 03:40:39.492
MEAN. DIESEL THAT'S REALLY

03:40:39.559 --> 03:40:40.293
THAT'S THE WHOLE THAT'S THE

03:40:40.360 --> 03:40:41.528
PLAN RIGHT NOW. WELL THAT IS

03:40:41.595 --> 03:40:44.464
WHEN YOU'RE TOLD THAT YOU HAVE

03:40:44.531 --> 03:40:45.966
TWELVE MONTHS AND THEN IT TURNS

03:40:46.032 --> 03:40:47.334
OUT THAT DO BY THE TIME YOU

03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:48.234

TO THE TO WIN AND YOU'RE ALSO

03:40:53.139 --> 03:40:54.341
UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS

03:40:54.407 --> 03:40:55.976
HOPEFULLY GOING TO GO AWAY AND

03:40:56.042 --> 03:40:57.744
NOT BE THE SOLUTION FOR THE

03:40:57.811 --> 03:40:59.679
FUTURE. YOU GO OUT AND YOU

03:40:59.746 --> 03:41:01.181
LEASE THE GENERATORS THAT ARE

03:41:01.247 --> 03:41:03.350
AVAILABLE TO MAKE THIS THING

03:41:03.416 --> 03:41:04.451
YOU KNOW GET US THROUGH THIS

EXPERIENCES AND WE HAVE A

03:41:08.955 --> 03:41:09.689
CONVERSATION COULD UNDERSTAND

03:41:09.756 --> 03:41:11.057
WHAT'S NEXT READ THE IN AND

03:41:11.124 --> 03:41:13.660
WHEN THEY ARE TECHNOLOGIES THAT

03:41:13.727 --> 03:41:16.096
ARE DEVELOPED THAT ALLOW COST

03:41:16.162 --> 03:41:18.331
EFFECTIVELY TO YES MASS STORE

03:41:18.398 --> 03:41:22.102
SOLAR ENERGY. FOR FIVE TO SEVEN

03:41:22.168 --> 03:41:23.637
DAY OUTAGES AT LEAST PUMPING

03:41:23.703 --> 03:41:30.310
PLANTS AND WE PUSH. WATER UP

03:41:30.377 --> 03:41:30.877
HILL IT'S HEAVY AND IT TAKES

03:41:30.944 --> 03:41:36.016
LESS ENERGY TO. SO THE TO IF

03:41:36.082 --> 03:41:37.017
WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE

03:41:37.083 --> 03:41:38.885
WILL BE FIRST IN LINE AS YOU

03:41:38.952 --> 03:41:39.419

LET US KNOW WE CAN DO TO HELP I

03:41:43.390 --> 03:41:43.857
MEAN THAT'S THAT WE'VE GOT

03:41:43.923 --> 03:41:45.525
WE'VE GOT A MONTH HERE. THERE

03:41:45.592 --> 03:41:46.326
ARE LEGISLATIVE VEHICLES MOVING

03:41:46.393 --> 03:41:46.960
IT TAKES AWHILE FOR THE PC TO

03:41:47.027 --> 03:41:48.695
GET GOING. I DON'T REALLY WANT

03:41:48.762 --> 03:41:49.295
TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT ROUND A

03:41:49.362 --> 03:41:51.998
WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS. TO

03:41:52.065 --> 03:41:54.300
GET THIS PART THIS STARTED

03:41:54.367 --> 03:41:54.868
BECAUSE THEY WERE. THEY JUST

03:41:54.934 --> 03:41:58.805
APPROVED ON. AND THEY ADDS FROM

03:41:58.872 --> 03:41:59.406
WHAT MY PERSPECTIVE IS POULTRY

03:41:59.472 --> 03:42:01.074
MITIGATION STRATEGIES AS-

03:42:01.141 --> 03:42:01.741
HAVING MODES OF MOBILE

03:42:01.808 --> 03:42:03.610
GENERATION SYSTEMS ON TRUCKS TO

03:42:03.677 --> 03:42:05.345
DRIVE AROUND AND I GUESS THEY

03:42:05.412 --> 03:42:05.979
NEED TO DEPLOY THESE STRATEGIES

03:42:06.046 --> 03:42:09.749
BUT. YOU KNOW SOME TRUCKS TO

03:42:09.816 --> 03:42:11.551
GET THERE AFTER THE FACT OR

03:42:11.618 --> 03:42:12.752
RESPONSE TO IT YOU KNOW AFTER

03:42:12.819 --> 03:42:15.021
THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN IS

03:42:15.088 --> 03:42:16.856
INSUFFICIENT SO I I'VE FOUGHT

03:42:16.923 --> 03:42:19.592
THE UC AS MUCH AS THE TILL

03:42:19.659 --> 03:42:20.694
THESE FOR THE INADEQUACY OF THE

03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:22.529
STRATEGIES BUT I ALSO THINK.

03:42:22.595 --> 03:42:24.064
THEY CAN GET CREATIVE IN

03:42:24.130 --> 03:42:25.131

DO NOT WANT TO BE PUT IN THAT

03:52:20.893 --> 03:52:24.630
PREDICAMENT. SO THE IT'S

03:52:24.697 --> 03:52:25.965
ALREADY BEEN STATED THAT YOU

03:52:26.032 --> 03:52:27.500
KNOW WE RELY ON ELECTRIC

03:52:27.566 --> 03:52:29.402
WHEELCHAIRS I HAVE AN ELECTRIC

03:52:29.468 --> 03:52:31.404
BED I HAVE AN ELECTRIC AIR

03:52:31.470 --> 03:52:33.673
MATTRESS. I EIGHT NEED AIR

03:52:33.739 --> 03:52:34.740
CONDITIONING I CAN'T TOLERATE

03:52:34.807 --> 03:52:37.810
SUPER HE- SUPER COLD THE WHOLE

03:52:37.877 --> 03:52:41.580
NINE YARDS SO. THERE'S PEOPLE

03:52:41.647 --> 03:52:43.049
WITH HOME ELEVATORS ALL OF A

03:52:43.115 --> 03:52:44.583
SUDDEN THE ENERGY COULD JUST BE

03:52:44.650 --> 03:52:47.019
SHUT OFF AND THEIR STOCK. AND

03:52:47.086 --> 03:52:48.220
THEIR TRAP ORDER SENIOR

03:52:48.287 --> 03:52:50.589
CITIZENS OR PEOPLE DISABILITIES

03:52:50.656 --> 03:52:51.490
THAT DON'T KNOW HOW TO MANUALLY

03:52:51.557 --> 03:52:53.559
OPEN THEIR GARAGE DOOR. NOR CAN

03:52:53.626 --> 03:52:56.796
THEY DO THAT. AND I FOUND IT

03:52:56.862 --> 03:52:59.565
VERY INTERESTING. YOU KNOW THAT

03:52:59.632 --> 03:53:01.567
AND ARTICLES WRITTEN RECENTLY

03:53:01.634 --> 03:53:04.036
BY EIGHT ON NORTH BAY BOHEMIAN

03:53:04.103 --> 03:53:06.339
CALLED USED ABOUT THE P.

03:53:06.405 --> 03:53:08.607
JEANNIE AND HOW MUCH MONEY THEY

03:53:08.674 --> 03:53:09.075
POURED INTO SOME OTHER

03:53:09.141 --> 03:53:12.378
FOUNDATIONS. AND I THINK IT'S

03:53:12.445 --> 03:53:14.547
TIME FROM THAT ARTICLE THAT THE

03:53:14.613 --> 03:53:17.249
PRIVATE UTILITY COMPANIES BE

03:53:17.316 --> 03:53:19.885
TAKEN OVER AND BECOME PUBLIC

03:53:19.952 --> 03:53:21.687
UTILITIES BECAUSE IT CONCERNS

03:53:21.754 --> 03:53:24.990
ME IF LEGISLATORS ARE MEMBERS

03:53:25.057 --> 03:53:26.726
OF THE C. P. C. P. YOU SEE ARE

03:53:26.792 --> 03:53:28.728
BEING WINED AND DINED. BY SOME

03:53:28.794 --> 03:53:35.034
OF THESE. C. E. O.'S. YOU KNOW

03:53:35.101 --> 03:53:37.036
THAT HOW DOES THAT HOLD THE

03:53:37.103 --> 03:53:39.805
PUBLIC INTEREST AT HEART OF THE

03:53:39.872 --> 03:53:44.343
COMMISSIONERS OR- YOU KNOW

03:53:44.410 --> 03:53:45.911
MEMBER CENTER ACCEPT CAMPAIGN

03:53:45.978 --> 03:53:48.681
CONTRIBUTIONS HOW DOES THAT HOW

03:53:48.748 --> 03:53:49.949
DOES THAT HELP US SO I MEAN THE

03:53:50.015 --> 03:53:51.817
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT NOT ONLY

03:53:51.884 --> 03:53:53.419
SHOULD A BACKUP RESIDENTIAL

03:53:53.486 --> 03:53:55.254
BATTERY POWERED SYSTEM BE

03:53:55.321 --> 03:53:58.824
PROVIDED BUT ALSO NOT KNOX BOX

03:53:58.891 --> 03:54:00.760
UNITS COULD BE INSTALLED THAT

03:54:00.826 --> 03:54:03.929
ONLY EARLY MERCHANTS HE

03:54:03.996 --> 03:54:07.466
PARAMEDICAL PEOPLE. X. WOULD

03:54:07.533 --> 03:54:10.069
HAVE ACCESS TO A PERSON'S HOME

03:54:10.136 --> 03:54:10.703
AND I HAD TO SIT HERE AND LAUGH

03:54:10.770 --> 03:54:11.337
WHEN I HEARD P. JEANNIE STATE.

03:54:11.404 --> 03:54:12.304
THAT THEY SEND A TRUCK OUT IF

03:54:12.371 --> 03:54:14.707
THEY CAN'T REACH YOU. BUT IF

03:54:14.774 --> 03:54:16.575
THE PERSON CAN'T GET OUT OF BED

03:54:16.642 --> 03:54:17.309
AND DOESN'T COME TO THE DOOR

03:54:17.376 --> 03:54:19.545
THEY JUST LEAVE A- LITTLE

03:54:19.612 --> 03:54:20.579
HANGER ON THEIR DOOR THAT THEY

03:54:20.646 --> 03:54:23.149
WERE THERE. THIS SIDE WE DO

03:54:23.215 --> 03:54:26.051
HAVE YOUR LETTER. THAT YOU KNOW

03:54:26.118 --> 03:54:28.053

HEAR SOME PEOPLE SAYING. ARMS

03:54:37.096 --> 03:54:37.596
IF THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

03:54:37.663 --> 03:54:40.633
CAN'T BE DESIGNATED FOR FUNDING

03:54:40.699 --> 03:54:42.101
FOR THE SOLUTIONS WE NEED

03:54:42.168 --> 03:54:45.304
SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS WE

03:54:45.371 --> 03:54:47.139
WILL DO THAT AND THANK YOU VERY

INTERNALIZATION AND POTENTIALLY

03:55:41.527 --> 03:55:42.995
IMPACTING MAJOR PORTIONS OF

03:55:43.062 --> 03:55:44.964
CALIFORNIA WE NEED MORE TOOLS

03:55:45.030 --> 03:55:47.166
LIKE SOLAR AND MICROGRAMS. A

03:55:47.233 --> 03:55:49.134
LOSS OF POWER CAN HAVE CREATES

03:55:49.201 --> 03:55:51.170
VERY SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS

03:55:51.237 --> 03:55:53.038
BUT ALSO VERY SERIOUS FINANCIAL

ECONOMY. THIRTY DIESEL BACKUP

03:55:58.811 --> 03:56:00.212
GENERATORS CANNOT BE THE TOOL

03:56:00.279 --> 03:56:02.414
RE REACH FOR TECH NET URGES

03:56:02.481 --> 03:56:03.749
SUPPORT FOR ELECTRICITY

MICROGRAPHS ARE ONE SUCH

03:56:14.360 --> 03:56:15.828
SOLUTION THAT CAN ALLOW MEMBER

03:56:15.895 --> 03:56:17.229

ENERGY NEEDS AND DO SO

03:56:19.565 --> 03:56:21.700
SUSTAINABLY. WE NEED TO SET

ONE IN INNOVATION AND TWENTY

03:56:52.598 --> 03:56:54.633
NINETEEN. I WHAT I THINK THE

03:56:54.700 --> 03:56:55.834
LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR WORK ON

THIS AND ALSO THE P. YOU SEE

03:56:57.436 --> 03:56:58.604
FOR ADDRESSING RESILIENCY IN

03:56:58.671 --> 03:57:00.039
THE ASTOR PROCEEDING THAT'S ON

03:57:00.105 --> 03:57:01.974
GOING RIGHT NOW. AND BUILDING

03:57:02.041 --> 03:57:03.275
ON WHAT OTHERS TOUCH ON EARLIER

03:57:03.342 --> 03:57:04.476
I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE

03:57:04.543 --> 03:57:05.878
IMPORTANCE OF MY GRADES IS A

03:57:05.945 --> 03:57:08.013
CRITICAL SOLUTION TO MITIGATING

03:57:08.080 --> 03:57:10.549
IMPACTS PSCS ARE COMMUNITIES.

03:57:10.616 --> 03:57:12.585
RESILIENCY IS INHERENTLY LOCAL

03:57:12.651 --> 03:57:14.153
AND MICRO GRIDS CAN PROVIDE

03:57:14.219 --> 03:57:17.756
LOCAL SUPPORT ACROSS THE STATE

03:57:17.823 --> 03:57:21.694
IN A DISTRIBUTED FASHION. THE

03:57:21.760 --> 03:57:22.494
DEAL WE AND AN INDUSTRY

03:57:22.561 --> 03:57:23.028
ACCEPTED DEFINITION OF MY

03:57:23.095 --> 03:57:23.495
GRADES IS A GROUP OF

03:57:23.562 --> 03:57:23.996
INTERCONNECTED LOADS AND

03:57:24.063 --> 03:57:25.130
DISTRIBUTE ENERGY RESOURCES

03:57:25.197 --> 03:57:26.198
WITH A CLEARLY DEFINED

03:57:26.265 --> 03:57:28.534
ELECTRICAL BOUNDARIES. THAT ACT

03:57:28.601 --> 03:57:29.935
AS A SINGLE CONTROLLABLE ENTITY

03:57:30.002 --> 03:57:31.804
WITH RESPECT TO THE GRAD AND

03:57:31.870 --> 03:57:34.373
CAN DISCONNECT AUTONOMOUSLY.

03:57:34.440 --> 03:57:35.674
MICROGRAPH OUR TECHNOLOGY

03:57:35.741 --> 03:57:37.509
NEUTRAL THEY HAVE A WIDE

03:57:37.576 --> 03:57:39.144
VARIETY OF GENERATION STORAGE

03:57:39.211 --> 03:57:40.346
AND CONTROLS THAT CAN BE PART

03:57:40.412 --> 03:57:42.047
OF THE MAKER GREG. SO I URGE

03:57:42.114 --> 03:57:43.549
MIKE LAWMAKERS AND POLICY

03:57:43.616 --> 03:57:45.517
MAKERS TO CREATE POLICIES THAT

03:57:45.584 --> 03:57:46.986
PROVIDE RESOURCES TO LOCAL

03:57:47.052 --> 03:57:48.654
GOVERNMENTS SPECIFICALLY AND

03:57:48.721 --> 03:57:50.823
PUBLIC AGENCIES TO PARTNER WITH

03:57:50.889 --> 03:57:51.991
DEVELOPERS TO CONSTRUCT THESE

03:57:52.057 --> 03:57:54.159
RESILIENCY PROJECTS. A TYPICAL

03:57:54.226 --> 03:57:55.728
COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY PROJECT

03:57:55.794 --> 03:57:57.663
THAT MIGHT HAVE HVAC LIGHTING

03:57:57.730 --> 03:57:59.231
AND MY GROUP CONTROLS COST

03:57:59.298 --> 03:58:00.799
ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO TWENTY

03:58:00.866 --> 03:58:02.334
MILLION DOLLARS FOR A LOCAL

03:58:02.401 --> 03:58:03.769
GOVERNMENT DEPENDING ON THE

03:58:03.836 --> 03:58:06.038
SIZE OF THE PROJECT. THE

03:58:06.105 --> 03:58:07.840
MICROCOMPUTER INS FOR RECENT

03:58:07.906 --> 03:58:09.942
PROJECT COST ONE MILLION

03:58:10.009 --> 03:58:13.312
DOLLARS TO ADD TO THE PROJECT.

03:58:13.379 --> 03:58:14.513
SO A REAL EXAMPLE COULD BE A

03:58:14.580 --> 03:58:15.114
CITY THAT HAS A COUPLE

03:58:15.180 --> 03:58:16.015
COMMUNITY FACILITIES DESIGNATED

03:58:16.081 --> 03:58:17.182
SCHOOLING IS OWNED BY THE

03:58:17.249 --> 03:58:18.951
UTILITY. THIS KIND OF PROJECT

03:58:19.018 --> 03:58:20.052
THAT I'VE JUST READ ABOUT IS

03:58:20.119 --> 03:58:22.054
TEN MILLION DOLLARS. ONE

03:58:22.121 --> 03:58:22.955
MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE A

03:58:23.022 --> 03:58:25.057
COMPONENT WITH HISTORIC

03:58:25.124 --> 03:58:26.291
INTEREST RATES THESE PROJECTS

03:58:26.358 --> 03:58:27.926
CAN BE FINANCED WITH TO HELP

03:58:27.993 --> 03:58:29.528
STE WHICH IS TAX EXEMPT LEASE

03:58:29.595 --> 03:58:30.996
PURCHASES AND OTHER FINANCING

03:58:31.063 --> 03:58:32.598
VEHICLES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY

03:58:32.665 --> 03:58:35.100
DEVOTED TO PUBLIC AGENCIES.

03:58:35.167 --> 03:58:37.536
THREE POINT 1% INTEREST. THAT

03:58:37.603 --> 03:58:41.206
IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN WHAT SOME

03:58:41.273 --> 03:58:41.740
OF THE OTHER ENTITIES ARE

03:58:41.807 --> 03:58:42.341
PROPOSING THEIR INTEREST RATES

03:58:42.408 --> 03:58:45.144
BE NOW. SO THESE ARE TYPICALLY

03:58:45.210 --> 03:58:45.911
TWENTY YEAR AGREEMENTS THEY

03:58:45.978 --> 03:58:47.479
HAVE NO CAPITAL OUTLAY AN

03:58:47.546 --> 03:58:49.281
IMMEDIATE SAVINGS OVER NINETY

03:58:49.348 --> 03:58:49.848
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR

03:58:49.915 --> 03:58:53.052
THESE PUBLIC AGENCIES. I JUST

03:58:53.118 --> 03:58:54.687
TALK WITH THE AGENCY LAST WEEK

03:58:54.753 --> 03:58:56.588
THAT SIDE THEY'RE RENTING

03:58:56.655 --> 03:58:57.389
TWENTY NINE DIESEL GENERATORS

03:58:57.456 --> 03:58:58.924
AT A COST OF FOUR HUNDRED

03:58:58.991 --> 03:58:59.925
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FOUR

03:58:59.992 --> 03:59:01.427
MONTHS. THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE

03:59:01.493 --> 03:59:02.928
FUEL OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

03:59:02.995 --> 03:59:04.763
COSTS ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT

03:59:04.830 --> 03:59:06.432
BE NEEDED OR HAVE THESE

03:59:06.498 --> 03:59:08.000
GENERATORS OPERATE SAFELY AND

03:59:08.067 --> 03:59:10.836
