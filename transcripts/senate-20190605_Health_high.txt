MUCH COME UP HERE SO WE'LL START WITH ITEM NUMBER. TWO EIGHTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE WELCOME THANK YOU I'VE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND IF I MAY BEFORE YOU BEGIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING VERY PROMPT. HEALTH COMMITTEE HEARINGS YOU BACK BACK TO THE TIME WE WERE TOGETHER THE ASSEMBLY GOING BACK TO THE OLD DAYS STRAIGHT ACTUALLY ASK YOU ALRIGHT I WILL WELCOME. YOU BET IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE MISTER. BEFORE I BEGIN I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE. THE SHORTAGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS REACHED CRISIS LEVELS AND CALIFORNIA'S SUFFERING AS A RESULT THE NOTCH NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR BEHAVE ORIEL HEALTH. IN ITS TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT PROJECTED DEMAND FOR PSYCHIATRY WOULD OUTSTRIP SERVICES BY 25% IN. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS IT NOW STANDS 55% OF COUNTIES IN THE U. S. HAVE NO PSYCHIATRIST AND 77% HAVE A SEVERE SHORTAGE. THE SHORTAGE IS CREATE A CRITICAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING TO PATCH. BY EXPANDING THE ROLES OF OTHER CATEGORIES OF WORKERS SUCH AS PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS NURSE PRACTITIONERS IMPAIR PROVIDERS. HOWEVER A LASTING SOLUTION REQUIRES A MORE SUBSTANTIVE FACTS THAT REVITALIZES THE FIELD OF PSYCHIATRY AND MUST INCLUDE AN INCENTIVE TO SECURE PROMISING STUDENTS INTO CAREERS AND COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRY. ENSURING OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY PSYCHIATRIC CARE. AB FIVE SIXTY FIVE ADDRESSES THE PSYCHIATRIC SHORTAGE BY TACKLING THE HEAVY BURDEN OF DEBT SO MANY STUDENTS SHOULDER AS THEY PURSUE AN ADVANCED MEDICAL DEGREE. IT'S NOT UNUSUAL IN CALIFORNIA TO FIND PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS IN TRAINING WITH DEBT LOADS EXCEEDING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS BILL WILL EXPANSIVELY GRANTS FOR PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO COMMIT TO WORKING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR WITH ME TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF AB FIVE SIXTY FIVE R. ADRIAN SHELTON. WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE AND RANDALL HAGAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU IN THIS IS SUPPORT. AFTERNOON ADRIAN SHELTON WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE AND WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR ASSEMBLY BILL. FIVE SIX FIVE ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION THAT RECENTLY RELEASED A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ABOUT OUR HEALTH WORKFORCE 45% OF PSYCHIATRISTS. IN CALIFORNIA ARE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY WHICH MEANS OUR WORKFORCE SHORTAGES ARE ONLY GONNA BE EXACERBATED OVER TIME. SO WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE PROACTIVE WE FEEL WITH REGARD TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES. LOWER PAYMENT PROGRAMS HELP TO GENERATE INTEREST AND HARD TO FILL PRACTICE SECTORS THAT ARE VITAL TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AND COMMUNITY BASED PSYCHIATRY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR WORK FORCE IN OUR SYSTEM OF CARE. WE'RE SPONSORING AB FIVE SIX FIVE BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY PSYCHIATRIC CARE IN THE COMMUNITIES THIS REALLY CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED. THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE TRAINING OUR FUTURE. A PSYCHIATRIC WORK FORCE AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE COMMITTEE PSYCHIATRIST WHO ARE SERVING THE MOST CHALLENGING POPULATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE SERVING THE HOMELESS FOR EXAMPLE. IN ONE EXAMPLE IN OAKLAND A TEAM OF DOCTORS AND SOCIAL WORKERS VISIT HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS AND THEY HAND OUT BASIC NECESSITIES LIKE CLEAN SOCKS LIKE FOOD BUT ALSO MEDICATIONS TO TREAT. DEPRESSION ANXIETY OR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS RECEPTIVE BUT THE TEAM COMES EVERY DAY OFFERING HELP HOPING TO BUILD ENOUGH TRUST OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL EVENTUALLY COME IN FOR CARE FOR THE CLINICS AND EVENTUALLY OFF THE STREETS ALL TOGETHER. THESE ARE THE PSYCHIATRISTS WERE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE SAY THE COMMUNITY BASED MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THIS VALUABLE WORK FORCE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RENTAL HAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. MACINNES DOVE TAIL BIT ON WHAT AGE ARE AND IT WAS SAYING YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A DEVELOPMENT IN. A PSYCHIATRIC TRAINING IN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS WE ACTUALLY HAVE SPECIALTY PROGRAMS THAT OFFER FELLOWSHIPS THAT PROVED PRODUCE THESE DOCTORS OR THE STREET OCTORS. AND IF I COULD HAVE PERMISSION TO READ JUST FOR FIVE LINES OF A PUBLICATION THIS IS FROM A UCSF. INTERNAL -- DOCUMENT -- LIGHTING THE SAME -- PSYCHIATRIST ACTUALLY WORK WITH THE LEADS TO CHI TRYST THERE -- IT WAS A COLD AND RAINY DAY WHEN THE DOCTOR FOUND ALVIN ON THE STREETS OF OAKLAND MONTHS OUT OF JAIL OFFICE PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS AND CONSIDERING TAKING HIS OWN LIFE. I WAS AT MY WIT'S END I WAS TIRED OF GETTING HIGH I WAS TIRED OF NOT BEING ON MEDICATION AND NOT BEING NORMAL. AND THIS TEAM ACTUALLY MET HIM WHERE HE LIVED WHICH IS HOMELESS ON THE STREETS AND WAS ABLE TO OFFER HIM THE TYPE OF SUPPORT THAT HE NEEDED AND IT'S IT'S IT'S TYPICAL OF THE KIND INNOVATIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THESE PUBLIC PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP. THAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE AND WHAT AND WE WANT TO EXPAND WE WANT THE BEST MEDICAL STUDENTS TO THINK ABOUT PSYCHIATRY. WE WANT TO BE THE BEST IN THE IN THE PSYCHIATRIC TRAINING PROGRAMS TO THINK ABOUT PUBLIC PSYCHIATRY BECAUSE IT'S VERY POORLY COMPENSATED AS YOU KNOW. THESE KINDS OF LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS CAN COMPLETE A REALLY GREAT ROLE AND AND GETTING THEM HERE THEY NEED TO BE. SO -- WE COMMEND THIS BILL TO YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER ADDITIONAL WITNESSES A SUPPORT NAME WORKSTATION POSITION. AND HOW THEY GOT THEMSELVES WITH KAISER PERMANENTE IN SUPPORT.

MEET THE GOAL OF CATCHING UP IF YOU WILL WITH A LOT OF THE BABY BOOMER PSYCHIATRISTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE RETIRING IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THANK YOU SENATOR SOUND THERE ARE THERE ARE PLANS AS YOU KNOW THAT GET THE CALIFORNIA HUMAN THE HEALTH HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE FUTURE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE COMMISSION. DOES HAVE LAID OUT A ROADMAP TO DO THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE ENGAGEMENT HERE AND LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON LONG TERM PLANS. I CAN SAY THAT INCREMENTALLY THERE HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE SOME INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED LIKE AND FRESNO AND BAKERSFIELD BY SOME OF THE UNIVERSITIES. AND THEY'RE SMALL BUT THEY DIDN'T MEET A CRITICAL NEED AND SO YOU KNOW BETWEEN THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AND THE OPERATION OF OF THE COMMISSION AND HOPEFULLY SOME OF FULFILLMENT OF ITS. ITS VISION FOR THE FUTURE WE WILL HAVE SOME MORE TRAINING SLOTS OF YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST WAVE A MAGIC WAND AND HAVE -- YOU KNOW. A SUPPLY OF PSYCHIATRISTS TO MEET THE STATE'S DEMANDS BUT COULD YOU JUST REFRESH MY MEMORY. HOW MANY YEARS POST TO MEDICAL SCHOOL -- TO GET THROUGH -- AND GET ALL YOUR DESIGNATIONS TO BE A BONAFIDE PSYCHIATRISTS AND CALIFORNIA THAT IS THE DOESN'T EVEN SAY THE TREE AND FURTHER SPECIALIZING BUT YES TO BECOME A BASIC PSYCHIATRISTS HOW LONG THAT TAKES.

A LOT OF MONEY ABOUT TRIGGERING A LOT IT HELLO A DEBT SO I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE IT QUITE THAT WAY YES -- I I THINK THAT THAT IT'S IT NEEDS TO BE SAID THAT THOSE WHO ARE GOING ON TO BECOME PUBLIC PSYCHIATRISTS ARE OFTEN ADDING ANOTHER TWO YEARS -- TO THOSE BASIC FOUR YEARS AND SO THAT'S A VERY DEDICATED INDIVIDUAL KNOWS THE PEOPLE WE WANT OUR TRACK. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL -- THANK YOU FOR BEING AFFORD I'M HAPPY TO MOVE IT AT THE PROPER TIME.

OKAY -- ACTUALLY DO HAVE AUTHORS TO PRESENT TO YOU TAKE AT THE END IF THAT AS LONG AS THE OKAY LET'S -- WE WANT I C. SEMINARIANS ARIAN HERE ITEM NUMBER. SIX EIGHTY NINE NINE THREE WELCOME [inaudible] YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. AB NINE NINE THREE REQUIRES A HEALTH PLAN OR AN INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE PLAN TO PERMIT AND HIV SPECIALIST TO BE AN ELIGIBLE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER. IF THE SPECIALIST REQUEST PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER STATUS AND MEETS THE HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO HELP PATIENTS SEEKING TO ACCESS THEIR COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE THROUGH THEIR HIV SPECIALIST WHEN THEY HAVE. WHEN THEY ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY -- DOING SO IN A TIMELY MANNER PATIENTS OFTEN HAVE TO GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEIR HIV SPECIALIST AND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER BECAUSE THE TREATMENT PLAN ADOPTED AT THE BEGINNING OF TREATMENT. IS NO LONGER RELEVANT AS THE DISEASE ADVANCES YOU MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DISEASE MATERIALIZE AND NEW APPROACHES AND TREATMENTS ARE NEEDED. THIS BILL IS REINTRODUCTION OF A. B. FIFTEEN THIRTY FOUR FROM LAST SESSION. AND THAT BILL RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND NO NO VOTES -- THE BILL WAS UNFORTUNATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR WITH THE PERSPECTIVE THAT AN HIV SPECIALIST CAN RECEIVE A STANDING REFERRAL. BUT THAT DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK BEST FOR THE PATIENT HAVING A SPECIALIST AS PCP FACILITATES BETTER THE MORE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR A PATIENT WITH HIV. AND GIVEN THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS VIRUS ITS LONG TERM EFFECTS I'VE DECIDED TO BRING IT FORTH AGAIN. WITH ME I HAVE THE SPONSOR RAN MARTIN ON BEHALF OF AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. THANK YOU WITNESSES REPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND WE HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS PATH BEFORE WE'RE HERE AGIN THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE TO THE BILL SINCE -- IT WAS LAST VOTED ON LEGISLATURE -- IN THE LAST SESSION I'M I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE ANALYSIS RIGHTLY POINTS OUT THAT PLANES COULD ALREADY DO THIS AND IN MANY CASES WHEN YOU'RE TALKING AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL OF PLANS THEY RECOGNIZE THAT -- THE THE ABILITY OF AN H. I. SPACE HIV SPECIALIST TO BE A PCP IS IS ALREADY AVAILABLE TO THEM WHAT'S HAPPENING UNFORTUNATELY AT THE PRACTICAL LEVEL WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING REFERRALS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE PLANS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. WE'RE GETTING DENIED OR WERE GETTING DELAYS WHERE A PERSON WHO NEEDS IN PARTICULAR -- A PARTICULAR SERVICE IS HAVING TO WAIT THIRTY OR SIXTY OR NINETY DAYS IN ORDER TO GET THAT BECAUSE THE PLAN IS NOT MOVING QUICKLY ENOUGH. TO ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF CARE -- REMAINS -- WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS CLARITY IN THE LAW -- THERE WILL BE -- LESS CHANCE THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE -- TO TO RECEIVE THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED -- THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL -- MANAGE HEALTHCARE HAS SUGGESTED TO US IN THE PAST THAT WE JUST USE THEIR PROCESS OF OF SENDING COMPLAINTS UP THE UP THE LADDER AND HAVING THEM DEAL WITH IT -- WE HAVE TRIED THAT -- IT'S HARD TO DO THAT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH SO MANY PATIENTS. ON AGAIN SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE LANGUAGE HERE IN THE STATUTE WILL PROVIDE THE CLARITY NECESSARY. TO TO FIX THIS PROBLEM ON A GOING ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES A SUPPORT. TAKE A BREAK -- WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORK CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. WHILE HE'S AT ALL WITH CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RESIDENTS FROM HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. OKAY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. XENON QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER STONE -- THE SO THANK YOU SOMEWHEREIN THIS AREA AND I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT -- AS A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AS A PEDIATRICIAN RECOGNIZE THAT ACTUALLY FOR MANY CONDITIONS THERE IS A PARTICULAR ROLE A SOMEONE WHO ALSO IS A SPECIALIST CAN PLAY AND IN TERMS OF HEALTH COORDINATOR CARE AND AS ALSO WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT ROLES A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN THEY SHOULD. A AND PROVIDE THE MEDICAL HOME THAN THEY CAN THEN WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO RECOGNIZE HIM FOR THAT SO WITH THAT IT'S BEEN MOVED -- I DO WISH TO CLOSE. I'LL TAKE YOUR COMMENTS AS THE CLOSE THANK YOU. HI THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN HI CAN I STONE STONE AYE DORADO. GROW. GROVE I HER TADO. FOR TITLE I LEYVA LEYVA AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MONNING RUBIO. RUBIO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THAT THOSE SEVEN VOTES WILL HOLD IT ON OFFER ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- CINEMA DONAL. WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB TEN FOURTEEN WELCOME [inaudible] IT AGAIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB. AB TEN FOURTEEN WHICH REQUIRES HOSPITALS AND HEALTH FACILITIES PROVIDE A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NOTED DAY NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC PRIOR TO DOWNGRADING CHANGING. OR CLOSING THEIR FACILITIES. I LIKE TOTHINK THE TERRORISTS AFTER WORKING WITH US ON AUTHORS AMENDMENTS -- YOU ALL SHOULD HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU THESE AMENDMENTS EXEMPT. THE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS -- ON BOTH THE BOTH EXPANSION OF SERVICES AND CLOSER DUE TO AN EMERGENCY OR NATURAL DISASTERS THANK YOU FOR THOSE -- HOSPITAL'S DECISION TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE SERVICE CREATES A SERIOUS CHALLENGE FOR COMMUNITY. IN MY DISTRICT JUST LAST YEAR THE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL OF LONG BEACH CLOSEST STORES AFTER ABRUPTLY DIVERTING EMERGENCY ROOM PATIENTS TO OTHER HOSPITALS. THIS WAS DONE WITH VERY LITTLE NOTICE TO RESIDENTS AND VERY LITTLE TIME TO ENGAGE THE HOSPITAL PROVIDER. ON AN ALTERNATIVE TO CLOSURE. AS A RESULT PATIENTS IN MY COMMUNITY NOW EXPERIENCE LONGER WAIT TIMES FOR SERVICES LONGER AMBULANCE TRAVEL TIMES AND OVERCROWDING AT OTHER HOSPITALS AND I'LL JUST KEEP IT CIVIL WHAT HAPPENED LONG BEACH WAS. WE WEREN'T GIVEN ENOUGH TIME ENOUGH NOTICE -- TO PREPARE FOR THAT HOSPITAL CLOSURES TO FIND ANOTHER OPERATOR FOR EXAMPLE AND THEY TELL THE TIMELINE BEEN A BIT LONGER. OR EVEN FOR EMERGENCY SERVICE PROVIDERS TO TO TO PLAN FOR THAT CLOSER SO THEY WERE MJOR IMPACTS ON A COUPLE DIFFERENT FRONTS WERE STRUGGLING WITH IT NOW. TRYING TO RE OPEN THAT HOSPITAL WE DO HAVE ANOTHER OPERATOR WE BELIEVE -- IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR THE HOSPITAL BUT AGAIN -- HAD WE HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME OF A TIME LINE TO ADDRESS A VARIETY OF ISSUES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER FOR THE COMMUNITY MUCH BETTER FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND ULTIMATELY. MUCH BETTER FOR CALIFORNIA WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I DO HAVE WITNESSES HERE TODAY. THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT. MR TURN MEMBERS TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION -- WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF AB. TEN FOURTEEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU'RE IN STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AB TEN FOURTEEN IS A COMMONSENSE PROPOSAL WHICH WILL ALLOW COMMUNITIES WORKERS IMPATIENCE MORE TIME TO PREPARE FOR CLOSURES. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL SAID WHEN A CLOSURES ANNOUNCED NURSES ELECTED OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE SOMETIMES ABLE TO GALVANIZE A CITY AND KEEP THE HOSPITAL OPERATING. OR FIND ANOTHER WORKABLE SOLUTION UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES WE ARE NOT ABLE TO KEEP FACILITIES OPEN AND THEY CLOSE LEAVING NEIGHBORHOODS AND HEALTH CARE DESERT. INCREASE NOTICE TIMELINES UNDER THIS BILL MEANS BETTER OUTCOMES FOR YOUR CITY AND MORE TIME FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY WILL RECEIVE HEALTHCARE OR WHERE THEIR NEXT JOB WILL BE. HOSPITALS ARE UNIQUE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND A VITAL PART OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST WHILE SOME MAY BE RUN BY CORPORATIONS THEY ARE STILL IN THE BUSINESS OF PUBLIC SERVICE. SAVING LIVES AND PROTECTING PATIENTS THE IN IS GRATEFUL TO OUR THREE BIPARTISAN JOINT AUTHORS WHO ALL HAVE EXPERIENCED A HOSPITAL CLOSURE IN THEIR DISTRICT AND UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THIS ISSUE. THIS BILL IS ASKING FOR THE BARE MINIMUM FROM HOSPITAL ADEQUATE NOTICE WHEN THEY DECIDE TO CLOSE NURSES I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THERE OF LOCKS IN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT -- I WANTED TO KNOW THAT IN THAT THE ANALYSIS THE OPPOSITION RAISE THE WARN ACT. HOSPITALS AREN'T LIKE BIG BOX OR MANUFACTURING THIS IS AN INSTITUTION THAT COMMUNITIES DEPEND ON EITHER FOR DIRECT MEDICAL SERVICES OR THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT NONPROFIT. HOSPITALS -- PROVIDE AND SO THIS IS A EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE OF THE TIME LINE WHEN A HOSPITAL IS GOING TO CLOSE. IS IS CRUCIAL SO THAT THEY CAN PREPARE FIND ANOTHER OPERATOR AND MAKE SURE THIS RESOURCE REMAINS IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO WE ARE DRIVE OUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS AMY BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LONG BEACH IN SUPPORT. TO MADDEN REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT BUT THIS IS AN OPPOSITION [inaudible] PLEASE [inaudible] WELCOME. CALDERON JUST CARP IN THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO THE BILL I'M GONNA TAKE THIS BILL IN THREE PARTS THE FIRST PART DOES DIRECTLY DEAL WITH THE EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES. MANY OF THE REEMERGENCE THE ROOMS THAT HAVE CLOSED HAVE BEEN CLOSED WITH ALONG WITH A HOSPITAL OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS OR FOR FINANCIAL REASONS SO WE HAVE A DEEP CONCERN ABOUT ADDING. THE LENGTH OF TIME -- THE SIX MONTH REQUIREMENT -- TO THE BILL WHEN OUR HOSPITAL IS FAILING AND THEY'RE WORKING O IN RED. AND THEN TRYING TO MANAGE THAT FOR ANOTHER THREE TO FOUR MONTHS -- IN ADDITION ONCE WE ANNOUNCED THE CLOSURE WE ACTUALLY TRY AND HELP OUR EMPLOYEES FIND. NEW JOBS THEY LOOK FOR NEW JOBS SO WE'RE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE REDUCED STAFFING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE HOSPITAL. THE OTHER TWO SECTIONS HOWEVER HAVEN'T BEEN MASSIVE MEANT MENTIONED FOR THE SECOND SECTION OF THE BILL ACTUALLY ADDS THE SIX MONTHS TO A CHANGE IN SERVICE. THAT MEANS THAT IF OUR HOSPITALS NICK YOU WANTS TO REDUCE ITS NUMBER OF BEDS BY TWO BY. TWO AND THEN MOVE THEM TO A PICK YOU WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT SIX MONTHS. BEFORE WE CAN START THAT PROCESS. OR IF THEY WANTED TO CLOSE THE SERVICE -- SO THAT THEY CAN OPEN ANOTHER WE CAN'T START THAT PROCESS FOR SIX MONTHS. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO NOTIFY FOR THE CLOSURE AND THEN START THE PROCESS OF BEGINNING THE NEW SERVICE SO FOR US THAT. ADDITIONAL TIME IN WHICH WE WANT TO CHANGE A SERVICE FOR A PATIENT OR FOR THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY COULD BE CRITICAL -- TO FOR EXAMPLE OF OUR BURN CENTER NEEDED TO CHANGE A DYNAMIC REDUCE IT SERVICES AND THEN WE MAKE THAT A MED SURGE WE'D HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT NOTIFICATION PERIOD. UNDERSTANDING THE CD PAGE -- PROCESS THE WAY WE DO WE SPONSORED A BILL LAST YEAR THAT ALLOWS THAT REQUIRE CD PAGE TO DO THEIR APPROVAL PROCESS AND A HUNDRED DAYS. BECAUSE IT WAS LONGER THAN THAT ON AVERAGE AS MUCH AS WE LOVE OUR CD PAGE PARTNERS WE WERE REALLY INTRODUCED A BILL TO FORCE THEM. TO REALLY SHORTEN THEIR TIME FRAME SO FOR US TO HAVE TO WAIT THE SIX MONTHS BECAUSE WERE CLOSING A PART OF A SERVICE AND THEN TO MANAGE THAT NEXT CHANGE ALTHOUGH THE BILL DOESN'T SAY WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR AN ADDITIONAL SERVICE. NOW WE STILL HAVE TO WAIT TO CLOSE THE SERVICE AND USUALLY WERE CLOSING THE SERVICE AND REPLACING IT WITH SOMETHING ELSE. SO FOR US THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS ON TOP OF A THREE MONTH -- HUNDRED DAY PERIOD -- AND THEN THE THE SORT OF CHANGE IN SERVICE THE NEXT SECTION OF THE BILL THE THIRD SECTION IS REALLY THE SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES WHICH ARE DEFINED SET OF SERVICES -- AND THEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER PART OF THE BILL TO TALK ABOUT A CHANGE IN SERVICE AND WOULD CREATE SOME CONFUSION AROUND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN IT. COMES TO HOSPITAL OPERATIONS WE CHANGE OUR SERVICES ALL THE TIME WE CHANGE THE TYPE OF MRI MACHINES WE USE IN THERE FOR THAT COULD BE A SERVICE OF THE MRI MACHINE IS USED FOR A NEW SERVICE OR A DIFFERENT SERVICE. WE CHANGE THE NUMBER OF BEDS IN MED SURGE UNITS OR IN -- PICK USER NICK USE ARE ALL OF THE VARIOUS PLACES IN THE HOSPITAL SO FOR US THE CHANGE IN SERVICES BECOMING AS WE TAKE A DEEPER LOOK INTO THIS BILL TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. IT'S BECOMING A DEEPER SET OF CONCERNS AND HOW IT WILL DELAY THE PER IN OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THAT COMMUNITY SO. FOR THOSE REASONS REMAIN OPPOSED. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. FACING NINE QUESTIONS MANY MEMBERS CENTER STONE YEAH THANK YOU -- CATHERINE IF I CAN ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS -- YOU KNOW WE WE WE THE LEGISLATURE HAS STRUGGLED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS OVER THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT. MY DISTRICT IF THAT PROGRAM GOES AWAY HOSPITAL CLOSE. SO. HOW DO YOU ENVISION THIS LEGISLATION TO BE ENFORCED IF A HOSPITAL CLOSES ABRUPTLY GOES INTO BANKRUPTCY? WHAT WHAT'S THE REMEDY I THINK. I THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT CV PH WOULD COME IN AND CLOSE THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STAFF TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE WE STILL ARE A LICENSED ENTITY THAT HAVEN'T PROVIDED A CERTAIN LEVEL. I WOULD HOPE THAT -- SHOULD THE PENALTY BILL GET PASSED WERE NOT ALSO PENALIZED ON TOP OF FIFTH -- BUT IT WOULD IT IS A FRUSTRATING SITUATION FOR HOSPITALS WHO -- AND USUALLY WHEN THE HOSPITAL CLOSES FOR FINANCIAL REASONS -- I THINK THE INSTANCE YOU TALKED ABOUT WAS BECAUSE OF SEISMIC IT WAS A DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES BUT WE'VE HAD HOSPITALS HAVE CLOSED BECAUSE I THINK WE THE WE'VE HAD HOSPITALS ARE CLOSING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY OPEN THEY CAN'T PAY PAYROLL THEY CAN'T ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AND SO SIX MONTHS COULD FRUSTRATE OKAY SO IT WAS. A FINANCIAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN IT YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZING THAT THE COMMUTER HOUSE ALONG BEACH HAD MARRIED REASONS SO THAT'S A REALITY AND THEN I SO I'LL POINT TO ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT HAPPENED IN MY AREA ALBEIT A DIFFERENT COUNTY THAT WE HAD A HOSPITAL DEAREST CALL FARBER COST BATTLE. THAT WAS HAVING SOME FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. AND WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO STAY IN BUSINESS VERY LONG. ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES FLED. AND THEY HAD NO STAFF TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR EMERGENCY ROOM SO -- USUALLY THE THE NURSES AND DOCTORS KNOW WHAT A HOSPITAL IS A GOOD FISCAL HEALTH ARE NOT GOOD FISCAL HEALTH AND IF THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND THAT. THE HOSPITALS GOING TO CLOSE AND YOUR EMPLOYEES FULLY -- I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU'RE GONNA COMPREHENSIVELY AND EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY OPERATE AN EMERGENCY ROOM AND I THINK YOU KINDA HIGHLIGHTED THAT AS ONE OF YOUR POINTS. AND THEN LASTLY HAVE YOU WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO COME UP WITH BABY SOME SERVICE AND EXEMPTIONS TO TO TALK ABOUT. AN EXAMPLE -- MY DAUGHTER JUST HAD TWINS AND AT THE HIGHS ARE IN -- WOODLAND HILLS. ANDTHE HAVE A NICK -- UNIT THERE BUT THE THE NICK YOU UNITS IN THE AREA THAT REALLY TAKES CARE OF THE MORE CRITICAL CASES AND PANORAMA CITY. SELECT -- KINDA MAYBE. SENDING PEOPLE MORE TO PANORAMA MAYBE DE EMPHASIZING THE WOODLAND HILLS SO IF THEY DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO TAKE TO NICK YOU UNITS OUT OF WOODLAND HILLS. AND TRANSFER THEM TO WEAR THEIR PROVIDING MORE COMPREHENSIVE NIKKI UNITS AND AND PANORAMA CITY ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO WAIT SIX MONTHS TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTUATE ARE GOING TO USE THAT EXAMPLE I THINK THE ANSWER IS. NOT EXACTLY FRANKLY BECAUSE THE BILL HAS AN EXEMPTION IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO ADD SO YOU DON'T TO WAIT SIX MONTHS TO ADD SO WOODLAND HILLS CAN ADD. TWENTY NICK PICKING THEIR GOING TO TAKE AWAY TO TO ADD. TO TWO DIFFERENT FACILITIES RIGHT SO THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT LICENSES -- WOODLAND HILLS COULD ADD ALL AT ONCE -- THE HANNAH AND I'M SORRY IF I MISUNDERSTOOD PAN OR THE PANORAMA CITY IS THAT IT WOULD WHAT SO WHOEVER'S THE WOODLAND IF THEY'RE TAKING AWAY YES WOULD HAVE TO WAIT THE SIX MONTHS. BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE AND SERVICE OR A DOWNGRADE AND SERVICE THAT HAVE TO WAIT THE SIX MONTHS TO TAKE THE BEDS OFF LINE OUR CONCERN IS IF THEY WANTED TO CONVERT THOSE TO A PICK YOU. THAT BOTH ARE A CHANGE THE PICK YOU COULD BE ADDED THE NICK YOU WOULD HAVE TO WAIT SIX MONTHS TO TAKE THEM OFF LINE IF YOU'RE USING THE SAME SPACE YOU'RE NOW WAITING THE SIX MONTHS. OKAY HAVE YOU TRIED WORKING WHEN THE AUTHOR ON HAVE HAD JUST CAPTIONS -- ON THE CHANGE IN SERVICE -- THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS. THEY JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS. SAID THAT OKAY YES PLEASE. LISTEN WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS I THINK SHE'S BROUGHT UP SOME VERY VALID POINTS AND I COMMIT TO WORKING WITH WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS ON THE CHECK SPECIFICALLY ON THAT CHANGE IN SERVICE. THIS CHANGE IN SERVICE QUESTIONS -- THANK YOU JOHN I WAS THAT SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ALWAYS A ONE SIZE FIT ALL THERE'S ALWAYS EXCEPTIONS IN. I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO GO BACK FOR NEXT YEAR FOR THE BILLS TO REPAIR THE BILL'S CLARA AND ATTEND CONSEQUENCES I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT YOUR ATTENTION AS AND SO -- I APPRECIATE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITE YEAH. THANK YOU AND YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING BRIEF SAY YES SIDE THROUGH THE CHAIR -- TAYLOR JACKSON FOR OF THE NURSES -- I DID WANT TO ALSO KNOW -- A TERM I'VE HEARD KIND OF COIN BY STAFF IS GHOST CLOSURES SO I DON'T WANT TO COMPLETELY NEGATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CHANGES IN SERVICES. BECAUSE OFTEN TO GET AROUND -- HOSPITAL CLOSURES WE WILL SEE EDIE'S ARE ICY USE OR MAJOR DEPARTMENTS CLOSE BEFORE THE FULL HOSPITAL CLOSURE SO I I DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW SAY THAT THE AUTHOR IS NOT OPEN AND OBVIOUSLY I JUST SPEAK FOR THE NURSES -- BUT YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF SMALLER CHANGES IN SERVICES THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IS DEFINITELY KIND OF A REASONABLE DISCUSSION BUT THE YOU KNOW CUTTING SERVICES AND HALF CLOSING ENTIRE DEPARTMENTS. I THINK THAT FALLS MORE IN THE KIND OF SIGNIFICANT ARENA AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY CONVERSATIONS ARE ON GOING ABOUT WHAT THE SCOPE OF THAT LANGUAGE WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I DID WANNA. PUT THAT OUT THERE AS WELL. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU CENTER RUBIO YES THANK YOU. BECAUSE I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF I MAY THINK KILL I'M JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. WHY THE ONE EIGHTY DAYS I GUESS I STRUGGLING TO FIND JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ONE EIGHTY DAYS? YOU KNOW WHAT I SPEAKER FOR THE I'M NOT. WHEN I'M I CAN SPEAK IN MY COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE WHY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS WELL WHEN HOSPITALS IN A CLOSING YOUR PLAN FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES WHERE THEY GOING TO TAKE THE PATIENTS THEY SERVE? VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; PARAMEDICS AMBULANCE&lt;/c&gt; SERVICES EXEDRA. AND ALSO WHAT YOU REALLY WANT THE BEST CASE SCENARIO IS YOU FIND ANOTHER OPERATOR TO COME IN. AND TAKE OVER THE HOSPITAL THAT'S WHAT WE SOUGHT TO DO HOMAGE TO THE TIMELINE JUST WASN'T LONG ENOUGH. AND US THAT THAT THAT'S WHERE WE GET THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS I MEAN I I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE CAN ASK FOR TWO YEARS. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO BE REASONABLE HERE. AT NIGHT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT YOU KNOW YOUR COMMUNITY CLOSING AND HAVING TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE BUT I GOT GUESS I'M ALSO STRUGGLING. THAT WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH THE CLOSING OF A HOSPITAL THEN THIS BILL ALSO TALKS ABOUT A CHANGE IN SERVICE SO. WHAT YOU JUST STATED DOESN'T REALLY QUITE ADDRESS FOR ME WHY THE CHANGE IN SERVICE? IF IT'S TO GIVE YOU KNOW -- HOSPITALS ENOUGH TIME. TO YOU KNOW TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE. WHY THE CHANGE IN SERVICE I'M ALSO STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND? I'M SORRY LIKE YOU KNOW ADDING SERVICES YEAH. I I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION I'M SORRY. WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLOSING DOWN WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR COMMUNITY YOU NEEDED TO CLOSE DOWN THE HOSPITAL AND PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND A NEW HOSPITAL TO GET SERVICES. BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT JUST AOUT CLOSING HOSPITAL IT ALSO TO YOU KNOW I JUST HEARD THE DISCUSSION ABOUT CHANGES IN SERVICE AND MY SENATE WRESTLING JUST A CLARIFY. THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS TO SAID YOU INCREASE THE SERVICE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT NOW IF YOU DO. CUT A REDUCE THE SERVICE YOU HAVE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS SUCH VIA CLARIFIED THAT SAID. THE THE THE AUTHOR DID ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT THAT IS BEFORE YOU. HERE TODAY SELL SELL ITS THAT GUY'S GOING ONE DIRECTION IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANT CUT OR REDUCE SERVICES IT'S A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS BUT IF YOU INCREASED THERE'S NO WAIT. BUT EVEN TEN YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW THEY WERE SHARING THAT SOMETIMES BASED ON DIFFERENT COMMUNITY NEED SOME TEARS UP COMMITTEE MIGHT FIND THAT THERE IS A HIGHER NEED FOR CERTAIN SERVICE. AGAIN EVERY COMMUNITY IS DIFFERENT AND SO I'M JUST ALSO WONDERING IN TERMS OF DECREASING SERVICES MOVING LET'S SAY RESOURCES FROM. ONE SERVICE TO ANOTHER. YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE JUST SPECIFIC TO THAT COMMUNITY SO AGAIN. I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE TWO ARE TOGETHER IN THIS BILL BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOUR SITUATION ABOUT THE CLOSING AND HAVING TO FIND A DIFFERENT PROVIDER. ON MAKING SURE THAT PATIENTS HAVE SERVICE BUT THEN THIS ADDED. ADDITION IS WHAT I'M CERTAINLY ALSO TO UNDERSTAND. THROUGH THE CHAIR I THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION -- OUR CONCERN IS ALWAYS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR OUR PATIENTS AS NURSES AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A HOSPITAL CLOSURE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COMMUNITY NOT HAVING ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES WHICH A DECREASE IN SERVICES FALLS WITHIN THAT. AND WHAT WE PREDOMINATELY SEE IT IS THESE GHOST CLOSURES WHERE THEY'RE CLOSING LARGE DEPARTMENTS ARE CUTTING DEPARTMENTS AND HALF AND THAT YOU KNOW DRAMATICALLY AFFECTS COMMUNITIES ACCESS TO SERVICES AS YOU'RE. WELL AWARE -- YOU KNOW I THINK AS WE'VE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY WERE OPEN TO WHEN THERE'SMORE MINUTE CHANGES ANA DEPARTMENT WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT LOWERING BY ONLY A FEW BAD. THRESHOLD -- THAT THAT'S SOME LANGUAGE WERE WILLING TO LOOK AT MOVING FORWARD BUT WE FEEL THAT LARGE SCALE CHANGES -- EVEN IF IT IS ONLY WITHIN A COUPLE DEPARTMENTS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY AS IF THEY ARE TRYING TO CLOSE THE WHOLE FACILITY. SO I KNOWLEDGE AS SOMETHING I JUST HEARD RIGHT NOW AS WELL. WHEN YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS? MY FEAR IN TERMS OF PROVIDING SERVICES AND I THINK SOMEONE EXPRESS SAID YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE KNOW THAT FROM THERE THEIR JOB IS GOING TO CLOSE WHETHER IT'S A HOSPITAL OR ANYTHING ELSE. THEY START LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB SO WHAT HAPPENS WITH NURSES AND OTHER YOU KNOW PROVIDERS DECIDE TO FIND ANOTHER JOB WHAT HAPPENS THEN. US SO SPEAKING FOR THE NURSES -- OUR EXPERIENCE AT HOSPITALS AS THEY HAVE DO NOT HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING STAFFING WHEN THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF WORKERS. FOR DIFFERENT REASONS THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND GROUPS THAT THEY USE ALSO THE PREDOMINATELY WHEN HOSPITALS ARE PLANNING CLOSER IS AN ATTRITION PLAN. NORMALLY PUT IN PLACE THEY MAKE A PLAN FOR WE ARE GOING TO LOSE SOME PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE -- WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING YOU DON'T WANT ALL THE WORKERS TRAPPED WITHOUT A JOB -- WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS UNDER CURRENT LAW WITH ONLY THE THIRTY DAYS NOTICE IF A HOSPITAL DOESN'T HAVE AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND NEW EMPLOYMENT IN LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS -- SO WE THINK IT'S VIRTUOUS AND WE DON'T THINK THE HOSPITALS WILL HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM FINING PEOPLE IF THEY DO DPH HAS THE AUTHORITY TO COME IN. AND CLOSE SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS OR THE WHOLE FACILITY BEFORE THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS SO IT'S NOT THAT HOSPITALS WILL BE. COMPLETELY JUST YOU KNOW OPERATING WITH NOBODY -- ON STAFF. BUT AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT AT THIS POINT YOUR YOUR YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY CAN GET TEMPORARY WORKERS TO FILL THE THE GAP BETWEEN BUT YOU KNOW WHENEVER SOMEONE LEAVES TO THE END OF THE ONE EIGHTY DAIS IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING. WELL IF I IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO MY OWN EXPERIENCE OF LONG BEACH AND IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY DID CORRECTLY -- WAS THE INCENTIVIZE. THE NURSES TO STAY ON FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME THERE WAS A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO STAY ON FOR AGAIN A DESIGNATED PERIOD OF TIME SO THE HOSPITAL COULD SUSTAIN OPERATIONS. AND WELL LET ME JUST FINISH THE THOUGHT OKAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW EARLIERI HEARD YOU SAY THAT YES THAT THERE'S A DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE UP AND PLAY THAT THEY COULD COME IN A FULL FILL THAT VOID YOU KNOW BUT BUT AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT QUALITY SERVICE. I MEAN I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE STAFF THAT YOU'RE NORMALLY HAVE ON A NORMAL BASIS AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN AND OUT. TO ME THAT DIMINISHES THE QUALITY OF SERVICE FOR FOR ANY PATIENT. WITH YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO BRING TEMPORARY WORKERS I DON'T THINK THAT IS FOR ME THE BEST OPTION TO PROVIDE BETTER CARE TO ME THAT'S DIMINISH SERVICES AND DIMINISH CARE. SO AGAIN I'M I'M REALLY STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND HOW A HOSPITAL THAT. ALREADY OPERATING IN THE RED WILL BE ABLE TO FILL THAT DEFICIENCY IN AND AGAIN IF NURSES ARE LEAVING A PROFESSIONALS UP IN THE FALL LONG TIME. I DO BELIEVE PERSONALLY THAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE BEST PEOPLE THAT KNOW THE SYSTEM THAT NO THE COMMUNITY THAT KNOW THE PATIENTS. TO ME IT'S STILL DIMINISH QUALITY OF CARE I'LL BUT THAT'S JUST MY PERSONAL DIED IN WHEN I'M STRUGGLING WITH BUT I ALSO RESEARCHED YOU KNOW OTHER STATES THAT HAVE. YOU KNOW THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND THEIR SIX STATES THAT HAVE -- I BELIEVE IT SIXTY DAYS NOTICE. SIX STATES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ONLY TO HAVE NINETY DAYS WERE ONE OF THEM ALREADY SO WE'RE ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF NOTIFICATION. AND WE WOULD BE THE FIRST ONES TO GO A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS SO I JUST. AGAIN THE ONE EIGHTY DAYS TO ME IS A LITTLE ARBITRARY I'M TRYING. TO YOU KNOW WHEN WE THINK OF THE OTHER SIX STATES AND ALREADY CALIFORNIA BEING THE MOST AGGRESSIVE I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS IS. I I'M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT NUMBER AND I'M STILL NOT. HEARING. HOW THAT JUSTIFIES THE ONE EIGHTY DAYS BUT FOR ANYBODY I CAN SPEAK MORE SPECIFICALLY TO THE? YEAH GO AHEAD. THROUGH THE CHAIR -- I I CAN'T SPEAK MORE SPECIFICALLY TO THE OTHER STATES OTHER THAN THIS WOULD BE -- A PERIOD OF TIME TO YOUR POINT WHERE -- WE COULD BRING IN TEMPORARY WORKERS BUT THOSE COMING TO A A PREMIUM AND YOU ARE CORRECT WE USUALLY -- WORK HARD TO RETAIN TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS POINT WE WE WILL PAY MORE TO RETAIN THEM BUT THEN AGAIN AS WERE MANAGING THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE HOSPITAL AND MAYBE WITH DECIDING TO CLOSE THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT OF THE HOSPITAL. CLOSE A HALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OR CLOSE I'M A PART OF A UNITS -- WE ARE NOW TO KEEP THE RETENTION LEVEL WERE NOW PAYING A PREMIUM. SO WE'RE NOW PAYING EVEN MORE WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO MANAGE THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE HOSPITAL SO ARE DIFFICULTY IS THE THE POSITION IT PUTS US AND BOTH FORMER TRYING TO MANAGE PATIENT CARE. OUR PATIENTS IN THE COMMUNITY I MANAGE WHAT THEY NEED FIGURE OUT DO WE NEED A BIGGER -- PICK YOU AND SO WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT HALF THE NICK YOU DO WE NEED A BIGGER MED SURGE WE NEED MORE CARDIAC SERVICES WAITING THAT SIX MONTHS FOR THE SPACE REQUIRED. CLOSING THE SERVICE AND THE SPACE REQUIRED WHETHER IT'S DOWNGRADING A SERVICE OR NOT -- PAYING THE A PREMIUM BECAUSE OF NURSES ARE NOW WE'RE EQUALLY INVESTED IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET THEM THE NEXT JOB SO WE MAY PUT TEM IN A DIFFERENT HOSPITAL ARE DIFFERENT PART OF THE HOSPITAL SO THAT THEY CAN LOOK FORWARD TO FIVE MORE YEARS OR TEN MORE YEARS. OR TWENTY MORE YEARS OF EMPLOYMENT AS OPPOSED TO THE FOUR MONTHS THERE WERE NOT PAYING A PREMIUM FOR TEMPORARY WORKERS WHICH IS FRUSTRATING THE PHYSICAL -- HEALTH OF THE HOSPITAL'S WELL SO KILL I HAVE MORE QUESTION OF ME. AND ACTUALLY THAN WHAT WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IS IS THAT WHEN YOU ASK QUESTIONS I'M GONNA ASSUME IS DIRECTED TO THE AUTHOR UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPECIFY WHICH WITNESS WHICH ANSWER ARE YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WITNESSES TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. YES -- YES OF YOU AND I WAS LOOKING AT ME BUT THE MEMBERS OF THE ASK A QUESTION ACTUALLY GET THE QUESTIONS ANSWERED THE WAY THEY YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR SEAT TO GET THE ANSWERS THEY'RE DEAD THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS OR SEEKING SELF YOU WANT. SO BASICALLY I WHAT IF IF YOU WANT DIRECT A QUESTION TO PARTICULAR PERSON THAT HELPS ME I'D TRY TO GUESS WHO YOU WANT REALLY WANNA HEAR FROM OKAY SOCIOLOGISTS OF THE LAST WANTED TO THE AUTHOR. AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN AN EXEMPTION FOR EMERGENCIES SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW THE PARADISE FIRE THAT BURNED DOWN A HOSPITAL THERE'S EXEMPTIONS AND AND YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT AMENDMENT. BY LET ME TAKE FOR EXAMPLE -- LET'S SAY THE WOLSELEY FIRE YOU KNOW MALIBU THAT THERE IS A FIRE AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE EMERGENCY A BRING DOWN AT THAT. TIME. BUT WHAT IF MONTHS LATER LET'S SAY A YEAR LATER AND WE SEE NOW WITH THE NINE ELEVEN TRAGEDY THAT. YEARS LATER IS MONTHS LATER PEOPLE STARTED SUFFERING WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF ELEMENT. OF PARTICULAR RESPIRATORY ISSUES ASK MAMA SO WHAT IF A YEAR FROM NOW ALL OF SEND DATA RICE'S FROM FROM THAT FIRE AND THEY'RE HAVING TO NEED EMERGENCY SERVICES AND CREATE MAYBE AT DEPARTMENT HANDLES THAT. IT'S SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE OUT SERVICES THAT WOULD NOT FALL UNDER THIS OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE SO THEY CAN. LEVEL OKAY SO WHAT IF. HOSPITAL DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES AND THEY NEEDED TO TAKE RESOURCES FROM ONE DEPARTMENT SO THEY CAN CREATE THIS OTHER DEPARTMENT THAT'S GRADING NEEDED IN THAT PARTICULAR HOSPITAL. VISITS TAKER THAT -- AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER WITH A CHANGE IN SERVICES PROVISION COULD POTENTIALLY USE FURTHER REFINEMENT AND I'M QUITE OPEN. TO HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS. THE GYM. YEAH I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE YOU KNOW. THE EXISTING ONE CALIFORNIA IS THIRTY DAYS FOR A HOSPITAL CLOSING THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CURRENT LAWS NINETY DAYS FOR AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WHICH IS. I WOULD SAY A MAJORITY OF THE HOSPITALS HAVE AN EMERGENCY AROUND -- AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT NEW YORK HAS NINETY DAYS AND NEW YORK HAS A HEALTH COMMISSIONER WHO ACTUALLY CAN DISPROVE HOSPITAL CLOSURES WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IN THIS BILL WE'RE NOT SEEKING. TO CONTROL IF A HOSPITAL INFLOWS WERE SIMPLY SPEAKING THE NOTICE AND I DO TAKE YOUR POINT WELL THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STATES THAT ARE NOT AT THIS LEVEL AND THIS WOULD BE FIRST IN THE NATION LEGISLATION -- A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AS OUR ATTEMPT TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN. GIVING THE COMMUNITY ENOUGH TIME TO POTENTIALLY FIND ANOTHER OPERATOR FIND ANOTHER SOLUTION. AND NOT CLOSE RIGHT AND IF IT DOES COME TO CLOSURE THE WORKERS ABOUT ENOUGH TIME TO TRY AND FIND OTHER EMPLOYMENT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEKING TO DO WITH THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS SO I DID WANT TO JUST. RESPOND TO THAT EARLIER COMMENT WELL AND I'LL JUST WRAP UP BY SAYING I MEAN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT BUT TO ME STILL YES THAT'LL GIVE ENOUGH -- TIME FOR HIM PLACE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT -- WHETHER IT'S TWENTY DAYS THIRTY DAYS FORTY DAYS BUT TO ME I STILL STRUGGLE WITH POTENTIALLY HAVING A GAP IN QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN THAT HOSPITAL. AND HAVING TO HOLD A HOSPITAL OPEN WHEN THE RESOURCES ARE NOT THERE SO I'M STILL. NOT QUITE THERE BUT THINK YOU FRENCH MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON A FEW QUESTIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE -- ASKED SO -- I GET THE FACT THAT IF THE FINANCE THE HOSPITALS I FINANCIALLY HEALTHY -- PEOPLE GONNA KNOW THAT AND THEY'RE GOING TO FLEE AND GET OTHER JOBS -- IS THERE. IS THERE A REQUIREMENT THAT STAFF AND MEDICAL PROVIDERS LIKE MAYBE THE CHAIR OR A NURSE STATE. AND FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE HOSPITAL TO EXTEND THE DAY IS THERE A REQUIREMENT IN THAT AT ALL. I'M SORRY DO YOU MEAN THAT THE CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT -- NURSE LEADER I'M SORRY TALKING ABOUT ANYBODY IF YOU HAVE A HOSPITAL THAT IS FINANCIALLY NOT STABLE AND YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO CLOSE AND FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT OPEN AND YOU HAVE TO MEET STAFFING RATIOS. AND YOU HAVE TO MEET ONE TO ONE CARE AT NIGHT YOU HAVE TO MEET ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS AND YOUR STAFF IS FLEEING. BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR JOB AND THEY NEED TO GO GET ANOTHER JOB BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAMILIES AND THEY HAVE -- STUFF THEY HAVE TO TAKECARE OF THEY CAN'T BE OUT OF A JOB I GET THAT RIGHT SO. IF THEY LEAVE A 50% OF YOUR NURSES HERE THE HOSPITAL CLOSER OR MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND THEY LEAVE TO GO FIND CONTRACTS OR JOBS AT OTHER HOSPITALS. HOW DO YOU MEET STAFFING RATIOS? HOW DO YOU? HAVE USED TO PROVIDE CARE TO THE COMMUNITY FOR THAT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. AND IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT REQUIRES NURSING AND PEOPLE THAT PROVIDE THAT QUALITY CARE TO THE COMMUNITY. THAT THEY STAY THE LAST DAY TELL I MEAN I'M JUST ASKING LIKE HOW DO YOU FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF PROVIDING SERVICES THE COMMUNITY. WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR STAFF AND I AM GET A STEAMER STAFFING I WITH THE TULARE CLOSER THERE IS NO WAY? IN HELL I WANT TO TRY AND SAY THAT BUT I WILL CHOOSE FROM. STOPPING UNFORTUNATELY -- WE WOULD USE TEMPORARY STAFFING LIKELY IN THIS CASE -- AND THEN I THINK AT THAT POINT WHEN WE CAN WHEN WE CAN TALK WITH CITY PATIENTS A WE JUST CAN'T MEET THE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS WE WOULD THEN ENGAGE CD PAGE AND THAT -- CONVERSATION THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER WERE PROVIDING SAFE CARE ANYMORE AND THEN I THINK THAT'S THE CORRECT TERMINOLOGY ON THE STATUE IN FRONT OF ME BUT THEY CAN COME IN. AND DETERMINE -- THAT THE HOSPITAL IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE -- ANYMORE AND THEY THEY WOULD THEN HAVE TO DRUM AND EARLIER THAN THE SIX MONTHS -- BUT THAT WOULD BE A CD PHP TERMINATION THAT'S NOT A SELF DETERMINATION OF THIS BILL WE HAVE TO GIVE THE NOTICE. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESS SO WE WOULD I WOULD HAVE TO BE DETERMINED THAT OUR STATE OR CARE IS UNSAFE WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING. WE EVER REALLY WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN. NO WHEN I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I I DON'T SEE -- I DON'T SEE I DON'T ON THE GROUND I KNOW WE DO THINGS IN THIS BUILDING WHERE WE THINK. YOU KNOW THIS SOUNDS GOOD UP HERE YOU KNOW AN EXAMPLE 1100% CLEAN AIR WE ALL WANT CLEAN AIR. BUT TO ACHIEVE ON THE GROUND WHEN A PERSON CLEANERS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE ANALYSTS TO SEPARATE SUBJECT. SO I GET THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF HOSPITALS NOT FINANCIALLY VIABLE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE NURSES HAVE OPPORTUNITY GO TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL A LOT OF TIMES THEY MAY HAVE TO RELOCATE THEIR FAMILIES THEY MAY HAVE TO MOVE. AND THEY MAY BE THE ONLY SOLE PROVIDER AND SO I GET THAT I UNDERSTAND WHERE THAN THE CARD THAT THE PART OF THE BILL THAT'S COMING FORWARD. WHAT DOESN'T OPERATE ON THE GROUND IS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR STAFFING NURSING RATIOS FOR PROVIDING CARDIAC CARE IF YOU HAVE A CARDIAC DEPARTMENT? FOR PROVIDING NICK YOU AND PICK YOU CARE IF YOU HAVE THAT ANYTHING YOU HAVE NO NICK YOU PICK YOU NURSES. AND THEY'RE AVAILABLE AT AT YOU DON'T WITH STAFFING RATIOS BECAUSE SOMEBODY CALLS IN AND SAYS HEY I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE THERE BUT I GOT A NEW JOB I HAVE TO START TODAY. AND YOU ALREADY CAN'T FIND NURSES. AND BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU'RE CLOSING SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WORK THERE FOR YOU KNOW A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OR SIXTY DAYS IF AND I I WOULD ASSUME. BASED ON JUST BUSINESS CLOSURE. OF STAFF THE EXTRA FIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE BUSINESS WORLD. THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THAT HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS A HARDER IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THE LAST TWO WEEKS LAST THIRTY DAYS LAST NINETY YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE HARDER. TO FIND THOSE PEOPLE SO I'M JUST WONDERING HOW YOU OPERATE ON THE GROUND IN THE REAL WORLD AS A HOSPITAL. WHEN THERE'S NO GUARANTEE OR ANYTHING THAT SAYS? YOU KNOW. LIKE THAT HERE WE ALL KNOW HE'S A PHYSICIAN AND YOU KNOW REQUIRE HIS ORGANIZATION IN HIS HIS TIME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS UNDER CONTRACT FOR THIS LINK THAT TIME OR NURSES. TO DO THE SAME I AM CONCERNED ABOUT PROVIDING QUALITY CARE. AND AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH CAN COMMAND BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE DON'T GET SERVICE OR WHAT HAPPENS. HELLO THAT TAKE THAT GONNA HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY THE CALLING GO HEY ARE NICK YOU UNIT DOESN'T HAVE ANY NURSES THAT ARE HERE TODAY WHAT WE DO WITH THESE NINE KIDS -- BABIES DO THEY SHOW UP INSTANTLY TO FIX YOUR PROBLEM OR I DON'T KNOW THAT AREA OF THE LAW IS INTIMATELY AS I PROBABLY SHOULD AT THIS MOMENT -- ONLY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE AS MANY CLOSURES -- TO PULL FROM I DO KNOW THAT CITY PAGE AND SOME CLOSURES HAVE CUT HAS COME IN -- AND DOWNGRADED ANY ARE FROM AN ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT TO BASIC LIFE SUPPORT OR THEY'VE COMMON AND SAID -- WE PERMIT YOU TO SORT OF START WITH THE PROCESS BEFORE THE NINETY DAYS IS UP BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT IT'S DIFFICULT TO STAFF AT THE RATIO WE NEED TO TO WANT -- ONE TO ONE SO WE HAVE INSTANCES WHERE THEY'VE COME IN AND BEGUN THE PROCESS SOONER THAN THE NINETY DAYS -- BECAUSE THE OUT QUALITY OF CAREIS ONE THAT -- IS IS IS JEOPARDIZED BY THE CLOSURE SO. I THINK THAT'S WHERE I CAN PROBABLY OFFLINE GET YOU A MORE -- DETAILED ANSWER THAT PROCESS NOW OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THINK RIGHT SURCHARGE. I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THIS TOPIC IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME IMPORTANT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY RURAL CALIFORNIA I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HOSPITAL THAT WE WON THE WE CREATE MORE HOSPITALS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN MY SENATE-DISTRICT -- THAT THE HOSPITALS THAT ARE THERE THAT THE REMAIN OPEN AND OBVIOUSLY THE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE OF IT IT JUST DEVASTATES A COMMUNITY. ARE. EIGHT VERY IN A VERY BAD WAY ALL THE WAY AROUND TO HOSPITALS TO PATIENTS. TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO EVERYTHING THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY I FEEL THAT WE'VE HAD THE MOST AMOUNT WELL WE I KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE MOST AMOUNT OF HOSPITAL CLOSURES. ACROSS THE STATE. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS BILL. YOU KNOW WOULD HELP PREVENT THAT IN THE FUTURE -- BUT YOU KNOW I ALSO. HAVE. SOME CONCERNS -- I KNOW THAT I WAS READING AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE MOST ONE OF THE MOST RECENT -- HOSPITAL CLOSURES DOWN IN AT THE CITY OF CORCORAN. AND THEY WENT. SO THEY RELIED THEIR SOURCE THEIR MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME CAME FROM THE PRESENT AND SO WHAT CUTS. ARE THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE -- SERVICES TO INMATES THEREFORE -- BABE REALIZE BASICALLY TWO THREE MONTHS THAT HEY. THIS THIS THIS CHANGE AT THE STATE LEVEL GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY DEVASTATE THE HOSPITAL. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP GOING AND SO. THEY ENDED UP CLOSING NOW YOU HAVE A WHOLE ENTIRE COMMUNITY THAT'S LEFT WITHOUT ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVIES. AND SO OBVIOUSLY LIKE I WANT AS MUCH. ADVANCE NOTICE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT YOU KNOW TO KNOW AS WE CAN PREPARE WE ALL I I THINK WE ALL OF THE BUT NEED TO DO THAT RIGHT BUT I GUESS I NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW IT WORKS AS YOU KNOW -- A COLLEAGUE FROM FROM BAKERSFIELD MENTIONED HOW IT WORKS ON THE GROUND BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO MY DISTRICT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE HOSPITALS DON'T CLOSE I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE. EMERGENCY SERVICES BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW IF IF THIS ACTUALLY. IF THIS BILL ACTUALLY KIND OF ADDRESSES THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS -- AND SO I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH WITH ALL OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES ADDRESS. THE ISSUES -- IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS EXTREMELY PART OF ME AND IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THOSE OF MY COMMUNITY. SO IF ANY OF YOU HAVING ANY COMMENTS ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY HOSPITALS AND THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RUBIO AS OUR IF NEEDED FOR ABSOLUTE THE AUTHORED TO ADDRESS IF YOU WISH TO MEET YOU AT THE YET SPECIFIC THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION MORE BROADLY SO. AND AND AND AGAIN I I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT'S OCCURRED. HISTORICALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I CANNOT I I BRING MY EXPERIENCE TO THE TABLE. WHICH WAS -- IT WAS ANNOUNCED A HOSPITALS CLOSING THEN THAT HOSPITAL CLOSURE WAS RAPIDLY EXPEDITED. AND IT HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON THE FACT GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE WERE LEFT WITHOUT AN EMERGENCY ROOM. WHERE DO YOU TAKE THOSE PATIENTS LONGER LONGER WAIT TIMES AND OTHER AREA HOSPITALS? AND THE WHOLE -- FOR FOR A FIRE DEPARTMENT NOW WHERE WHERE THEY TAKE PATIENTS SO IT BACKS UP. YOU KNOW THERE TIMELINE TO RESPOND TO TWO NINE ONE ONE CALLS SO WHAT I'M SIMPLY TRYING TO DO HERE TODAY IS TO HAVE A COMMUNITY MORE. NOTICE SO THAT THEY CAN BE PREPARED FOR WHEN A HOSPITAL DOES CLOSE AND THAT MEANS MAYBE FINDING ANOTHER OPERATOR THAT'S TYPICALLY THE HOLY GRAIL. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN FOR SURE WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT BUT AGAIN TO FOR COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY ON EMERGENCY SERVICES SIDE TO BE ABLE TO PLAN. FOR WHEN THAT OCCURS -- CENTER ST FAQ FROM MISTER CHAIR I'D APPRECIATE -- SENATOR RUBIO AS RESEARCH ON THIS AS FAR AS THE NINETY DAYS CATHARINE THAT OTHER STATES -- EMPLOYEE WHICH SEEMS TO BE WORKING -- AND AND I THINK THAT WHAT THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS -- OR TRYING TO DO IS IS IS IS NOBLE. AND I THINK IT PROBABLY WOULD WORK BETTER IN LARGER METROPOLITAN AREAS WHEN YOU HAVE A HOSPITAL LIKE. CEDAR SINAI HOSPITAL IN LOS ANGELES THAT HAS THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY APPROACH. TO PSYCHIATRY SURGERY -- BE YOU KNOW AIDS CARE. THEY THEY HAVE ALL THE SERVICES NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE SEEING THIS IN THE RURAL AREAS OUTSIDE OF WHERE I'M FROM BUT IN THE TO MACULAR VALLEY -- WE OFTEN HOUSE HOSPITALS THAT ARE OWNED BY THE SAME ENTITY SO AS AN EXAMPLE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT ABOUT A HOSPITAL WHERE FRENCH SPRINGS HOSPITAL. BOB THEY CATER TO ABOUT. HALF A MILLION PEOPLE AND THE CHEMICAL RALLY. AND THEY HAVE FOUND AN ECONOMY OF SCALE THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE HOSPITAL THAT SPECIALIZES IN NYC YOU. AND YOU HAVE ONE HOSPITAL THAT SPECIALIZES IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE -- THAT THAT'S BETTER FOR THE PATIENT AND IT'S MORE ECONOMICAL FOR A HOSPITAL THESE VERY CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES AND THAT ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN. TO MAKE IT ABOUT A HOSPITAL'S A NEW HOSPITAL'S BEEN IN OUR AREA FOR ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS. AND THEY HAVE DECIDED THEY'RE SPECIALIZING NOW AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH STROKE HEART ATTACK VICTIMS AND THE DE EMPHASIZE. THEIR THEIR BEATNIK YOU THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IF YOU UNIT THERE ANYMORE THEY'VE CLOSED DOWN IN A BOOTH AT TORRENTIAL SPRINGS WHICH IS. A FIFTEEN MINUTE DRIVE TWENTY MINUTES WHAT WHAT WHAT WITH TRAFFIC. SO -- IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. THERE'S NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO THE AREA REALLY. AND THERE'S NO LOSS OF JOBS FOR THE NURSES WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLY A PRIMARY CONCERN -- AS TO WHY YOU'RE SPONSORING THIS BILL. AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE THESE KIND OF SCENARIOS WERE THE IT'S A ZERO SUM GAME BUT THE AREAS GETTING A BETTER SERVICE AND PROVIDING YOU KNOW MORE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. IN SPECIALIZED WAY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S GOTTA BE A MODALITY TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN UNDER YOUR BILL FOR YOUR FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I ONE HUNDRED IF YOUR COMMENT ON SOME OF THE SPECIALTIES IN THE SMALLER -- A RULER IS LIKE I REPRESENTS SOME OF THE RURAL AREAS LIFE HOSPITAL. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A TWO TWO HOURS FROM THE QUOTE FROM FAR FROM PALM DESERT OR PALM SPRINGS AND THESE THESE PEOPLE HAVE LIMITED CHOICES. I THINK THE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS BILL IS THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO BE FRANK -- WE HAVE SEEN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE HOSPITALS -- COLLABORATE AND DO WHAT YOU JUST SAID IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS THAT SPECIALIZE -- IN OR SO AND pALSO HOSPITALS SPECIALIZING CARDIAC AND ALSO SPECIALIZE IN STROKE WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT IN OUR URBAN AREAS AS WELL SAN FRANCISCO OUT A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. YOU'RE HAVING A STROKE YOU KIND OF KNOW WHAT ALL SPITTLE TO GO -- TO EXCEPT TRACK -- THE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS TO YOUR POINT IS WELL AS IS OUR RULE HOSPITALS STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY IN A REAL WAY WE HAVE HOSPITALS THAT CAN'T MAKE PAYROLL FOR THREE MONTHS. AND THEY ONLY HAVE RESERVES FOR TWO MONTHS SO WHEN THEY ARE OUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET ENOUGH OF THAT SYSTEM -- TO HELP THEM AFFILIATE WITH THEM OR WHAT NOT AND NOT FROM SUCCESSFUL THEY MAY ONLY HAVE TWO MONTHS OF PAYROLL LEFT -- WE AND NOT I CAN THINK OF FOUR FOUR FIVE HOSPITALS SO. THUS SECTIONS TO WIN THREE RELATED TO CHANGE IN SERVICE MAYBE A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT IF YOU NEED TO DOWNSIZE OR DOWNGRADE OR TAKE A SERVICE OFFLINE SO THAT YOU CAN KEEP YOUR E. R. AND MED SURGE AND SURGICAL SUITE OPEN. FOR ANOTHER TWO MONTHS -- SO I THINK THAT THE STRUGGLE AND AND I HEAR THE AUTHOR WANTING TO TALK MORE ABOUT THAT THE BILL IS THE DIVERSE OF IT. OUR HOSPITALS HAVE PROBABLY TEN DIFFERENT COMMON WAYS IN WHICH WE MANAGE OUR SERVICES ENCLOSURE. AND I'M PROBABLY BEING THOSE ARE BIG BUCKETS I AM I CAN PROP THERE'S PROBABLY FIFTY DIFFERENT WAYS OUR HOSPITALS MANAGE THEIR OPERATIONS AND SERVICES SO. A CENTER ALSO [inaudible] YES -- I'M HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHY THIS IS BAD FOR ANY COMMUNITY. ANY PART OF THE STATE I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU'RE AT AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD FROM A BIG CITY LIKE LOS ANGELES. OR A SMALL TOWN LIKE SELMA OR FRESNO -- WE'RE TRYING TO DEALWITH WHAT'S THE BEST THING TO DO. IN THAT KIND OF A SITUATION. AND IF YOU'RE A SMALL PLACE I WOULD WANT TO HOLD ON TO THAT HOSPITAL AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. I WOULD WANT IT THIS. TO CLOSE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OR SIXTY DAYS OR NINETY DAYS I WANTED TO STAY OPEN. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE PROCESS OF ALLOWING A LONGER TIME BEFORE IT CLOSES BECAUSE THE LOSS OF THAT HOSPITALS SO DEVASTATED. ESPECIALLY IN A RURAL AREA ESPECIALLY WELL AREN'T SO MANY HOSPITALS. WHY WOULD WE WANT TO THE LENGTH OF TIME TO REALLY JUDGE ANY VALUE WAITING GET INPUT? AS TO ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES ARE THERE YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DO THIS HOW DO YOU DO IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT'S THE MOST RESPONSIBLE WITH COMMUNITY INPUT SO -- IT IS I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT FROM A BIG CITY TO A RURAL AREA IN FACT IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. FOR RURAL AREA WHERE THERE'S LESS -- ACCESS -- TO TO HOSPITALS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE DEEPEST MOST PROFOUND PROCESS. AND THE POSSIBILITY EXTEND THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY. MAYBE. NOT CLOSE. NOW WOULD BE THE IDEAL IT SEEMS TO ME JUST ANNOUNCED THE CLOSURE AND GET OUT IS NOT THE IDEAL IT'S THE LYNC THAN IT IS TO DO THAT SO. IF IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE IN OUR SENATOR YOU JUST EXPLAIN THE REASON FOR THE BILL. THAT IS THE REASON FOR BILL THIS IS THE EXPERIENCE I HAD A LONG WHICH IS REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE. WE HAD WE HAD A LONGER TIME LINE WE COULD HAVE SOUGHT ANOTHER OPERATOR KEPT A HOSPITAL OPEN HAD WE HAD A LONGER TIME NINE WE COULD'VE ADJUSTED ARE MERGING Z. SERVICES TO MAKE A MORE APPROPRIATE. TO TO TO TO SHORTEN. THE WAIT TO GET INTO AN EMERGENCY ROOM SO TO ME THIS BILL IS A NO BRAINER THIS BILL IS ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY SAVING LIVES THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WE NEED TO WORK ON I'VE COMMITTED THAT WE'VE GONE BACK TO THOSE A COUPLE TIMES I WELL UNDERSTAND THAT AND I'M COMMITTED TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT. BUT AGAIN -- THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL TO SAVE LIVES AND AND AND THAT'S WHAT IT DOES FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. SO I KNOW WE ABOUT TO OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS TO ASK PREVIOUS THIS OF ON THE BIGGER INDULGENCE ARE HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL GET. TO TO YOU THAT RIGHT OKAY BECAUSE SO I THE ONE THING I WANT -- TO AND I KNOW YOU SAID THIS SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING UP. BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT LIKE LITTLE CHANGE THOUGH LANDS WE SHRINK A UNIT BY COUPLE BEDS AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND TALK ABOUT THE SCALE BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT HOSPITAL CLOSURES. ARE LET'S SAY A HOSPITAL. IN A RURAL COMMUNITY IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE DELIVERY SOUTH AND AND THEY DECIDED I SHUT DOWN OBGYN. AND SO THE QUESTION THERE IS IN THERE THE ONLY DELIVERY SITE FOR A VERY LONG DISTANCE. THE QUESTION IS IS THAT HOW MUCH TIME AND I REALIZE THERE'S A BALANCE HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW MAYBE THE REASON YOU'RE MAKING IS FINANCIAL. A BALANCE IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU GIVE THE COMMUNITY A CHANCE. TO MOBILIZE THEIR RESOURCES TO SAY WHETHER WE CAN SAVE THAT UNIT OR FIND AN ALTERNATIVE. TO THAT SO WE CAN KEEP THAT SERVICE IN OUR COMMUNITY. IS THAT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AUTHOR. WELL LET ME FIRST LET ME JUST. I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT THE ROLE THE CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS USE WHY DOES BELIEVE THERE'S TWELVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE IS ACTUALLY IN MY DISTRICT ON CATALINA ISLAND. SO I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK AT ALL THAT I'M NOT -- WELL AWARE. OF THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH SMALL CRITICAL ROLE ACCESS HOSPITALS OF BUT AGAIN THIS BILL IS. MY INTENT. IS TO GIVE COMMUNITIES TIME TO PLAN. TIME TO PLAN TIME TO ACT TO SERVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THAT COMMUNITY IT'S VERY SIMPLE NOW I GET THE CHANGE IN SERVICES I THAT'S PRETTY TECHNICAL STUFF I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN WORK IT OUT. RIGHT NOW -- MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M QUITE OPENING TO TO TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AND I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK WHEN THINGS WERE GOING TO LOOK INTO IS IS THAT GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE BILL IN THE LICENSURE EXACTLY. SAMPLE SWITCHING ON MRI MACHINE I DON'T THINK CAUSES FOR RE REVIEW OF THE LICENSE WILL L. WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF THINGS WOULD ACTUALLY BE TRIGGERED BY THIS BILL WHAT LEVEL. OF CHANGE I'VE WE WE WHAT WE WANT TO GO OVERBOARD EITHER -- THEIR CELL AGAIN APPRECIATE CONVERSATION CERTAINLY I THINK MY STAFF. LOOKING INTO THAT SO WE CAN COME OUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT NIT PICKING. YEAH CHANGES IN SERVICE VOTE MORE TALKING ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES SERVICE WHETHER YOU'RE LIMITING TIRED DOUBLE OF THE HOSPITAL CLOSURE ON ANY TIRE DEPARTMENTS OR MAJOR CHANGES TO THOSE. THESE TWO MAJOR DEPARTMENTS WHERE THERE WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT REALLY IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I MEAN I KNOW THE SUBJECT OF THIS IS HOSPITALS. BUT REALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMPACT THE COMMUNITY AND ABILITY THE COMMUNITY TO NOW RESPOND TO THIS BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL OBVIOUSLY IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMMUNITY THERE'S A SET OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THEY'RE BEING DELIVERED BY THIS INSTITUTION. AND WHEN THAT INSTITUTION DECIDES NO LONGER DELIVER THAT WHETHER THROUGH CLOSURE OF THE INSTITUTION ARE SOME CHANGE THAT INSTITUTION. WELL HOW MUCH TIME DO WE GIVE THE COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST TO THAT AND TO RESPOND AND EVEN SEEK AN ALTERNATIVE PROVIDER OF THOSE SERVICES. AND I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE WERE TRYING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH. RECOGNIZING THAT WE ALSO YOU KNOW WE NEED WE DON'T WHILE THESE OTHER SERVICES BY -- UNDERCUTTING -- THE THE THE THE THE THE THE HOSPITAL WHICH IS LIVING OTHER SERVICES WELL OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO I AM LET'S I THINK I SAW CENTER RUBIO'S FIRST AND AND THAT'S OUR GOV OKAY SIR RUBIO. YEAH AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL VERY CLEAR HERE THAT I THINK EVERYONE. ON THIS DíAS IF I MAY IS WERE ALL VERY INTERESTED IN KEEPING THE HOSPITAL'S OPEN WERE VERY INTERESTED OF TAKING CARE OF OF OUR YOU KNOW VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT BEING ON BOARD ON THAT THAT PERSPECTIVE AND AND I KNOW YOU KNOW TO MY FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES IT MAYES. SEEM LIKE A NO BRAINER BUT I'VE HEARD THE AUTHORS AND I HEARD THE OPPONENTS WILL SPEAK ABOUT TEMPORARY WORKERS. AND FOR ME WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT QUALITY CARE THIS SERVICE IS VERY PARTICULAR YOU'RE DEALING WITH PATIENT CARE. SO WHEN I HEAR THAT WE'RE GOING TO FULFILL YOU KNOW WE NEED WORKERS WITH TEMPORARY WORKERS. THAT IS AN ISSUE FOR ME AND I I AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK AND AS DOCTOR PANDA EXPRESS ARE STILL OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE ON THE TABLE. I ALWAYS OPEN TO SUPPORT AT A LATER TIME WHEN ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED BUT AT THIS POINT AGAIN I WANT TO JUST MAKE CLEAR WE ALL CARE ABOUT PATIENTS WE ALL CARE ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S JUST MAKING SURE THAT OUR PATIENTS DON'T SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES RATHER -- BUT I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WANTED TO BRING A FORTNIGHT NIGHT DEFINITELY AGREE WITH OUT DOCTOR POUND THAT IT'S A NOBLE -- QUESTIONS SORT OF TO BE IRONED OUT THANK YOU. JUST MISTER MISTER CARVER MAY DELUDE YOU'D PROBABLY BE SURPRISED HOW MANY OF TEMPORARY WORK WORKERS ARE IN ANY HOSPITAL ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND WE WE TYPICALLY LABEL THEM TEMPORARY BURNING IS REGISTRY. I HAVE NEIGHBORS WHO DO THAT THEY TYPICALLY GO BACK TO THE SAME HOSPITAL QUITE OFTEN SO THEY'RE VERY FAMILIAR. WITH WITH WITH WITH THE CULTURE OF THAT HOSPITAL LOGISTICS OF THAT HOUSE WAS AGAIN THEY'RE VERY THEY'RE THEY'RE A GOOD NUMBER OF OF OF QUOTE UNQUOTE TEMPORARY WORKERS -- ANY HOSPITAL IN ANY GIVEN DAY. AND AGAIN TO IN THE LONG BEACH SITUATION THE INCENTIVIZED -- NURSES OTHER STAFF MEMBERS TO STAY THROUGH THE LENGTH. THE TO THE TO THE AID THE TIME PERIOD DESIGNATED FOR UNTIL THE CLOSURE HAPPEN AGAIN AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH COULD COME IN NOW. AND SHUT DOWN A HOSPITAL IF THEY DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING THAT'S TODAY. ABSENT THIS BILL AND WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO RETAIN THAT POWER FOR SURE. A SENATOR OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN AM I JUST LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION IT'S GOING BACK AND FORTH -- BUT I WENT THROUGH A RULE CLOSURE TULARE COUNTY HOSPITAL WAS A ROAD CLOSURE WAS IN THE SENATE IT'S IN THE SENATE DISTRICT NOW BUT IT WAS AN IN THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHEN -- WHEN I REPRESENTED THEM IN THE ASSEMBLY OR THE SOUTH PART THAT COUNTY AND THE BIG ISSUE THERE IS A SOON AS EVERYBODY REALIZED IT WAS AND I'M TECH AND WE WENT THROUGH BOND MEASURES TO GET ADDITIONAL TAXES TO FIND IT TO HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE THAT REVIEW MINISTRY TEARS. TO WORKING WITH THE HOSPITALS TO DOING EVERYTHING THERE IS A HUGE CENTER FULLER WORK SO HARD TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. BUT AS SOON AS IT CAME DOWN AND THEY MISSED ONE PAYROLL NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING EVIL OR MEAN BUT THERE WAS NO MONEY -- SO O FIND SOMETHING FOR A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS WHEN THERE'S NO MONEY WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM. BECAUSE IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION NURSES AND STAFF WAS NOT GETTING PAID IN THE TULARE COUNTY HOSPITAL WHEN IT WAS BEING SHUT DOWN. AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU TOOK THE AMENDMENTS ON THE EXPANSION BECAUSE IMMEDIATELY THE BY SELLING A HOSPITAL HAD TO STAND UP AND EXPAND. ON THAT THIS SOME OF THEIR FACILITIES SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE A DELIVER MORE BABIES BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE ROOM SO THEY HAD. TO SHUT DOWN SOME AREAS THAT WEREN'T SO YOU KNOW VERY AFTER SOME SOME STUFF THAT WAS BEING USED ALL THE TIME. BUT WE HAD TO MODIFY STUFF VERY QUICKLY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR OUR COMMUNITY. SO I REALIZE IT TOOK A MINUTE GOING ONE WAY BUT GOING THE OTHER WAY IF IF THERE'S NO HOPE FOR THE HOSPITAL CLOSURE. AND TO BE BOUGHT OUT OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU SIX MONTHS IS CRAZY TO WAIT. AND TO ALTER A NOTHER HOSPITAL IT'S RECEIVING ALL THOSE PATIENTS IN ORDER. TO AND CUT OUT AN AREA THAT THEY MAY NOT NEED A LIKE A BARIATRICS PORTION MAYBE THEY REDUCE THAT SIZE WHICH IS WAITING CAPITA BY CELL YES. THEY REDUCED A PORTION OF THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO TAKE ON A HIGHER -- HIGHER VOLUME OF ACTIVITY WHERE PEOPLE NEEDED MORE SERVICES IN A PARTICULAR AREA BUT THIS IN ORDER TO DO THAT I UNDERSTAND YOUR BILL WILL REQUIRE THEM TO WAIT SIX MONTHS. BEFORE THEY EVEN STARTED THAT CHANGE AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION YOU'VE ALREADY SAID. BUT THAT TO LARRY COUNTY HOSPITAL CLOSURE GOING THROUGH THAT AND TO SAY THAT RULE AREAS ARE ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE THE REST IN CALIFORNIA WE WANT OUR HOSPITALS I MEAN THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM TULARE ONCE OUR HOSPITALS TO SUCCEED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE PEOPLE IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE GREAT HOSPITAL SERVICES BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT RIDGECREST CLOSE DOWN THEIR HOSPITAL WITH THE TRANSFER OF DETACHED BE TAPPED TO BE HAD. THE MODEL IN CHANGE THINGS AND YOU KNOW THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THREE BALLOT MEASURES LATER AND ALL THE SEISMIC AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS TO GO THROUGH TO BUILD A HOSPITAL TO PROVIDE SERVICES. FOR OUR COMMUNITY I JUST THINK THAT. pI GET IT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE -- SERVICES BUT TO PUT THIS BILL IN PLACE ON THE GROUND WHEN THERE'S NO MONEY. IN [inaudible] TO RETAIN. I MEAN THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS AS NURSES OR MEDICAL WRITER SERVICES HAVE TO SAY THE LAST DAY TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THAT COMMUNITY IF THERE IS NO ONE TO TAKE IT OVER. I IT'S JUST A HARD BILL TO GET AROUND -- BECAUSE WE'VE GONE THROUGH IT INTO THEIR UNIT IT DOES THIS BILL DOES NOT WORK ON THE GROUND. THEY WERE GETTING PAID. STAFF WAS AN UNPAID. AFTER NINETY DAYS RIGHT -- TO NOT GET PAID AFTER A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS I AND THEN FILLING THE SLOTS WHEN STAFF LEAVES THAT SAID. IT'S I JUST DON'T SEE IT WORKING IN ON THE GROUND IF THAT MAKES SENSE IN THEM. REAL WORLD [inaudible] JUST WANTED. PRETTY MUCH THREE INTERVIEW WITH MY COLLEAGUE AT JUST MENTION RIGHT NOW. WE SHARE TULARE HOSPITAL WE SEEM TO STRUGGLE THERE [inaudible] AND I I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS I MEAN I'M I'M STRUGGLING I I REALLY I'M WITH THE BILL -- I WILL SAY I WILL SUPPORT YOU TODAY. AND I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE AMENDMENTS SO THAT IT WORKS. FOR THE VALLEY BUT I ALSO WANT -- TO FIVE YOU KNOW. LET YOU KNOW THAT THAT I'VE YOU KNOW RESERVE RESERVE MY RIGHT TO TO NOT PUT OUT VOTE FOR IT ON THE FLOOR IF IT DOESN'T. WORK FOR THE VALLEY BECAUSE I I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN THAT. THIS BILL COULD IMPACT THOSE HOSPITALS LIKE TULARE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW THEY JUST. YOU KNOW TRANSITION INTO IT AND TO A DIFFERENT ONE AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SURVIVE -- WE ALWAYS OBVIOUSLY WE ALL WANT TO KEEP THEM OPEN BUT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SO -- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT -- YOU'RE ALL WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE IT WORK. I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. TO TO MAKE SURE THAT HOSPITAL'S REMAIN OPEN THAT ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE CONTINUED HAVE ACCESS -- TO A HEALTH CARE NOTS OBVIOUSLY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME IN MY DISTRICT AND SO THANK YOU FOR WORKING TOGETHER I WILL VOTE FOR IT TODAY BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH BOTH OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS FOR ALL OF US. THANK YOU SIR MITCHELL. OF QUESTION FOR YOU ON MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR IS SAID THAT THE THEIR TECHNICAL TECHNICAL YET SUBSTANTIVE BASE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS AND ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. AND WE'RE IN THE SECOND HOUSE AND SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE -- SO -- SO I THINK -- IN APPRECIATE YOUR VALUES COULD BUT WE ARE THE POLICY COMMITTEE AND SOUNDS LIKE WE STILL SOME POLICY ISSUES -- I UNDERSTAND FROM L. MY STAFF WHO WERE NOT WE DO NOT THINK THERE WAS SOME OF THAT. ALL CHANGES WOULD BE BUT I ALSO. RAY TWO CAME OUT AND WE DIDN'T THINK THAT REALLY OF BUT WERE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE ALSO LOVE YOU SHOULD BECOME A GOOD PRODUCT YOU HEARD THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THINK THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS -- NO I I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD BECAUSE I DO THINK WE WILL WE NEED HE'S COMEDIAN MIND WHY HAVE THE COMMUNITY HAVE TIME TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS I THINK THAT'S THE PURPOSE YOUR BILL. BUT I THINK -- GIVEN THAN WHERE TO CONVERSATIONS BED AND AND AND AND I THINK THERE ARE THINGS I APPRECIATE YOU. PERHAPS -- WITH -- WOULD BE GRATEFUL TO HAVING JUST THE BILL HOW OLD FOR SO WE CAN WORK SOME OF THESE OUT BEFORE -- WE TAKE A VOTE ON THE BILL SO SO YOUR DESIRE IS TO HOLD THE BILL TODAY JUST YEAH SO WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION -- THAT SAYS SO THAT TO WORK OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES IN TERMS OF LIKE EXACTLY. YEAH WE HAVE FOUR MORE HEARING SO YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIMES MY NEXT QUESTION YES -- THEIR FORMER HERE IS THAT THIS IS THE VERY FIRST ONE FOR THE ASSEMBLY LINE SO WE HAVE TIME TO WORK OUT I A L. A. GENERALLY SUPPORT THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE MINUTES I SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME ISSUES THAT. WE CAN WORK OUT HERE IN THE COMMITTEE I THINK THE BILL WOULD COME OUT STRONGER AND WITH MUCH WITH US THAT'S A MORE MORE THROUGH THE ESSEX SUPPORT -- AND THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL SO -- SINCE WE HAVE TIME IT WILL. SELL. THAT IS THAT IS YOUR DESIRE MISTER CERTAINLY AGREE TO IT I HAVEN'T AND AGAIN I I THOUGHT THIS WAS WORKED OUT SO YEAH I'D I THOUGHT SO TOO BUT I THINK THAT -- SOUNDS LIKE IN TERMS OF WHAT EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF A CHANGE NEEDS TO HAPPEN BEFORE WE TRIGGERED THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S STILL UP IN THE AIR. YES A SENTIMENTAL YES AND I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR TO THE OFFER THAT THAT MIGHT INQUIRE RE -- AND SUGGESTED THAT IT BE HELD -- IS WITHOUT PREJUDICE. ALL WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME -- ON AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT'S THE POINT OF THE POLICY COMMITTEE SO I'D I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO ASSUME THAT -- I MADE THE SUGGESTION IN AN EFFORT TO KILL THE BILL AT ALL THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING I KNEW THAT WE HAD TIME. TO DO THE WORK FOR PEOPLE SO SOME OF THE UNREST COULD PERHAPS BE SOLVED -- OR NOT YEAH AND I AND I THINK -- MY DESIRE OF WOULD BE. TO GET THE BILL OUT -- BUT I THINK THAT WE DO A LITTLE MORE WORK ON IT BECAUSE I THINK SOME ADDITIONAL THINGS CAME UP TODAY A FIVE EASIER. FOR FOR THE COMMITTEE WITH PLENTY OF TIMES THERE'S NO TIMING ISSUE AS UNLESS. SO I DECIDED TO DAD BEFORE YET AND SEE WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS WERE GONNA LISTEN I'M WILLING TO GO TO WORK AND SEE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH A COMPROMISE. AND IN SOMETHING THAT WORKS THAT REALLY DOES. FOR THE INTENT OF THE BILL. AS WELL -- AGAIN THAT THIS WAS NEW INFORMATION TO ME TODAY THAT THERE WERE STILL PROBLEMS I THOUGHT WE'D TAKE THE ISLANDS AND WE WERE IN A VERY GOOD SPOT. AT IOWA AND I STAYED FOR MYSELF AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH I AGREE WITH YOU THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. I THINK IN SOME SENSES -- SOUNDS LIKE WE NEED TO DO A LOT MORE WORK WITH I THOUGHT WE WERE IN THE RIGHT PLACE BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S STILL SOME OUTSTANDING ISSUES WE STILL HAVE SOMETIME MY DESIRES TO GET THIS BILL OUT THE COMMITTEE -- SO I I HOPE BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT HOPING THAT -- MAYBE WE CAN MAKE SOME SOME FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS THAT WAY AND WE WILL AGENDA IS IT FOR A MEETING -- YES OF COURSE NEXT WHAT FOR MEETINGS AND YEAH PROBABLY EARLIER THAN LATER. WE CAN GET SO I THINK AND I SINCE WE AND SINCE WE'VE HAD TO DISCUSS AND I THINK SINCE WE'VE HAD THAT DISCUSSION. THE DESIRE WOULD BE JUST TO DO IT IS A VOTE ON ABOUT ON THE THAN YES THE CLINCHER. OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT AND I SAID A LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU AND GAS AND I APPRECIATE AGAIN I THOUGHT WE WERE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND I APPRECIATE. YOU BEING YEAH AND WHAT WE'LL WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT THEN THANK YOU I THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. OKAY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATRICK NORRIS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE -- SO ITEM NUMBER EIGHT A V. TEN SIXTY THREE WELCOME. SIX SEVEN THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU I FOR YOUR WORK AND ANALYSIS ON THIS SIDE HELPING US MOVE IT FORWARD. I THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AGAINST ONGOING FEDERAL ATTEMPTS TO UNDERMINE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL AND THE STATE CHANGE IN STATUTE PRIOR TO MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE COVER CALIFORNIA PROGRAM THROUGH THE USE OF THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS. THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS ALLOWING STATES TO WAIVE EXTENSIVE PORTIONS OF THE ACA. AS PART OF ITS STRATEGY TO UNDERMINE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. ISSUED A NEW FEDERAL GUIDANCE AND REINTERPRETATION OF THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS. DRAMATICALLY RELAXING WAIVER GUARDRAILS. UNDER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION GUIDANCE SECTION THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS GIVE STATES THE ABILITY TO WAIT OUT OF OFFERING COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE ARE COVERING A COMPARABLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. THIS ACTION EXPOSES PEOPLE PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS TO HIGHER PREMIUMS OR LACK OF COVERAGE. THE REINTERPRETATION ALSO ALLOWS STATES TO PURSUE THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVERS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR EXPLICIT STATE LEGISLATION. INSTEAD WAIVERS CAN NOW BE AUTHORIZED FOR STATE REGULATION OR BY AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. IN CALIFORNIA IS AS YOU ALL KNOW THE LEGISLATURE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO WEIGH IN ON ANY MAJOR CHANGES REQUIRED A WAIVER OF FEDERAL LAW. WHAT WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE AT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAY FOR AT THIS MOMENT? I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT MOMENTS DO YOU CHANGE AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT AT THIS POINT TO SHORE UP HE ACA IN CALIFORNIA TO ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE THREATS. AND TO CODIFY THE LEGISLATOR THE TEACHER'S ROLE IN MAKING THESE SORTS OF SWEEPING POLICY CHANGES TO THE ACA. I AB TEN THIRTY TEN SIXTY THREE AT THE NECESSARY LAYER OF PROTECTION TO THE ACA. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT AND PLEASED TO INTRODUCE TO SUPPORTERS HERE. TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU WITNESSES WHAT. STEPHANIE MEDICARE MEMBERS JESS CAM RANH ON HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF AB TEN SIXTY THREE WHICH IS REQUIRE EXPLICIT -- APPROVE LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL BEFORE ESTATE BEFORE THE STATE CAN -- APPLY FOR INTIMATE AT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO OVER TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO INNOVATION RIVER ALLOWS STATES TO PURSUE ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF IMPLEMENTING THE ECA AS LONG AS THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL GOALS OF THE ACA. WELL WE CANNOT IMAGINE CALIFORNIA EVER USING A THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WAIVER TO UNDO THE SPECIAL OF THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACA WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT CONTINUES PLAY A KEY ROLE. IN ANY FUTURE AT THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO EVER CONSIDERATION THE SAME WAY THEY DID IN INFINITY CA. REGION'S RUSS HERE I ABOUT TODAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- I'LL BE BRIEF BUT I WOULD JUST A NOTE THAT PART OF THE REASON THAT CVERED CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA IS BECAUSE OF THE THOUGHTFUL IMPLEMENTATION WORK THAT WAS DONE IN THE LEGISLATURE. PRIOR TO THE LAUNCHING OF THAT WE'VE SEEN IN A MUCH DIFFERENT. EXPERIENCE IN MANY STATES THAT ARE ON THE FEDERAL MARKETPLACE FOR EXAMPLE -- THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN THOUGHTFUL AND WAIT IN PREVIOUSLY ON WHAT IT CONSIDERS TO BE JUNK INSURANCE AND DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE IN WHAT COVER CALIFORNIA CANNING CAN'T OFFER AFFECT OUR MARKET AS A WHOLE. SO WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS REALLY JUST MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO AND SAYING THAT -- CHANGES TO THE LAW SHOULD BE HAPPENING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TAKE A BREAK A NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORK CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. MILEY'S ABOUT REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WHEN A TERROR WHAT'S WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK IN SUPPORT? THANK YOU. OKAY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEN ON QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT'S BEEN MOVED ST A YES SIR GROWTH HAVE ONE QUESTION AND ONLY BECAUSE I'M CURIOUS ARE THERE ANY OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THEM TO COME BACK TO US FOR APPROVAL FOR ANY NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. OR WILL THIS BE THE FIRST AND THE ONLY. ONE SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE. MANY THURS EXTENSIVE EXAMPLES OF WHERE YOU KNOW. LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE HAS AUTHORITY AND SO MANY ARENAS. TO IN A DEFINING STATUE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT OUR STATE AGENCIES AND I THINK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT WE MAINTAIN NOT PARTICULARLY ON SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S THIS IMPORTANT. I MEAN I AGREE I'M JUST BUT I'M JUST ASKING IS THIS THE ONLY IS THIS THE ONLY AGENCY THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO REQUIRE. TO COME BACK AND GET I OUR APPROVAL. AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY IN ORDER TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON BEHALF OF THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE ONLY EIGHT THE ONLY AGENCY. SO I DON'T WHAT WE'RE NOT SEEN THAT THERE'S A SPECIFIC SO THERE'S HONEST THERE'S ON A SPECIFIC AGENCY THAT WOULD BE COMING TO US FOR APPROVAL WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING THAT. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING CHANGES TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SHOULD NEED TO COME FROM LEGISLATIVE STATUTE AND FROM THE LEGISLATURE. DID YOU WANNA AT HHS YEAH RIGHT SO IN TERMS OF WHEN A WEAVER IS ALLOWED THERE HAS TO BE A FEDERAL STATUTE THAT AUTHORIZES THE WAIVER TO HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO MOST AREAS OF CALIFORNIA LAW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT SAYING GO AHEAD AND WAIT FOR A LAW BUT IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THEN OCCASIONALLY WITH MEDICAID OR MEDICARE. THERE ARE CERTAIN PROVISIONS THAT CAN BE WAIVED AND THERE'S CERTAIN GUIDELINES UNDER THAT SO WITH MEDI CAL OR MEDICAID PROGRAM LAST YEAR THERE WERE SOME GUARD RAILS THAT WERE PUT ON NGUYEN DH CS CAN'T WHAT KIND. TYPES OF WAIVERS THEY CAN SEEK -- THE ACA ITSELF WAS THE STATUE THAT SAID THAT WAIVERS WERE ALLOWED BUT IT WAS SILENT ON HOW A WAIVER WOULD BE SOUGHT. PREVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA HAD PRESUME TO DO IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WE SAW A WAIVER PREVIOUSLY THAT WHAT THAT HAD LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND IT WAS ONLY AND FALL WHEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID WERE NOW INVITING STATES TO DO WAIVERS WITHOUT STATUTORY AUTHORITY. THAT WE THOUGHT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD BE NECESSARY. I MEAN THE ONLY CONCERN THAT I HAVE IN THIS IS A DAY TO JEAN WHEN SIR I SUPPORTING YOUR BILL I JUST AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND DO YOU KNOW IN JUST ASK SOME QUESTIONS BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED. THERE'S A ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP OBVIOUSLY THE CALIFORNIA FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN WE NEED WAIVERS AND AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU GUYS THAT CALIFORNIA PERMITTED PUBLIC HEALTH IS AT FOR WAIVER IF THAT WEAVER IS NOT EXTENDED BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS NOT COMPLY. IS THIS A NOTHER I WAS A JAB IT IS MY QUESTION I GUESS IS IS THAT. IF VALID WAIVERS THAT WE NEED THAT WE APPLY FOR AS A STATE ALL THE TIME WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY GRANT TO US SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES. TO THE CONSTITUENTS THAT WE REPRESENT. IS THIS IS THIS A A BILL AND I GUESS IT GOES BACK TO MY QUESTION THAT. IS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS THIS THE ONLY AGENCY THAT GOVERNS THIS THE YOU KNOW TELLING YOU SEE ARE THEY THE ONLY AGENCY WE'RE REQUIRING TO COME BACK TO LEGISLATIVE CONTROL AGAIN I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S ANSWERED MY QUESTION. ARE THERE OTHER AGENCIES THAT HAVE TO COME BACK FOR LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL IN ORDER TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON ISSUES. OR IS THIS THE ONLY ONE AND IF THIS IS. I DON'T SEE DID I DON'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE IF IF THIS JUST CREASES MORE HAVOC WHERE WE REALLY DO NEED THAT WAIVER BECAUSE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS NOT IN LINE LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AND THEY COULD JUST. YOU KNOW NOT YOU SHE WAS A WAVERING PENALIZE US AND PUNISH AS AN ALL OF THAT SO WE NEED A WAIVER. IS THIS LIKE A DIG AT THEM AND CAUSES ISSUES BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF RETALIATORY ON BOTH SIDES. AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK THIS IS YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THIS IS RETALIX TELL YUR STORY AND I DON'T THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN ANYTHING CONTROVERSIAL I THINK IT'S JUST ESTABLISH AS AS I SAID THAT. THE FACT THAT WE WENT DECISIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW. WHERE WAIVERS ARE TIGHTENED HOW THAT WANTED TO COME FROM THE LEGISLATURE SO IT'S OF A MAJOR STAR DRESSERS LISTS ARE AND I THINK US THEIR MITCHELL MAY? I ALSO HAVE SOME COMMENTS ARE AS YOU MAY HAVE A SEPARATE QUESTION BUT OFTENTIMES. WE WILL -- ASKER REQUEST THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE SURE THEIR WAIVER PROPOSALS COME BEFORE US -- NOT JUST WAIVERS BUT OTHER TYPES OF DECISIONS WELL SO FRANKLY -- I SEE THIS IS MORE -- US BEING A BILL BE SURE WE EXERCISE OVERSIGHT OVER THE ADMINISTRATION -- ADD BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THEY DON'T COME TO US AND THEN THEY GET THE WAIVERS AND SUDDENLY NOW THE LEGISLATURE'S FORCED TO DEAL WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS SAYING WELL PUBLIC ABOUT YOU KNOW WHY IS THIS WAIVER. NOW DISADVANTAGING OUR DISTRICT OR WHATEVER ELSE SO I THINK THAT -- IN MY MIND THIS IS ABOUT. OUR ABILITY TO OVERSEE THE NATURE OF THE WAIVER THAT'S BEING REQUESTED OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE SURE THAT IT -- THAT -- THAT WE CAN EXERCISE OVERSIGHT OVER OVER THAT -- SO THAT'S IN MY MIND IS REALLY WHAT THE ISSUE IS AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I UNDERSTAND BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE RECIPROCAL WAIVER RIGHT THERE'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A WAIVER. FOR S. TO OBTAIN IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AYE NEGOTIATION AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WAIVERS THAT WE REQUEST FROM THEM. TO IN ORDER TO OPERATE TO DELIVER SERVICES TO OUR OUR CONSTITUENTS I GUESS MISSION THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT I REALIZE THAT THIS IS ONLY ONE WAY I WRITE THAT. BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE THERE ARE TWENTY SIX WAIVERS RIGHT NOW AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ASKING FOR ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND I GUESS MY MY CONCERN IS IS THAT IF WE REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES TO ELONGATE THAT PROCESS WHICH IS BILLED AS FOR ONE AGENCY. AND IT WHERE DOES THAT TAKE US WHEN WE NEED SOMETHING FROM THEM. WELL I THINK WHAT AGAIN WHY AM IS IS THIS IS A WAIVER THAT CALIFORNIA WILL BE REQUESTING. AND ALSO -- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE NATURE OF THIS WAIVER SO IT'S NOT EVEN BROADLY FOR EVERYTHING THE HEALTH. THE H. T. S. DOES ITS FIRST VERY SPECIFIC TYPE A WAIVER YES THAT -- THAT CAN HAVE A BIG IMPACT SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO KNOW -- AND WE GO THROUGH THIS A LOT ALSO IN OTHER PROCESSES TO THE GUIDE THE THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO WILL WE DON'T NEED LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL OVERSIGHT WILL AY NO YES WE DID YOU DO BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING. RIGHT OTHER THROUGH WAIVER THROUGH SOME OTHER ACTION AS WELL THAT'S THERE THAT'S A CONSTANT ADVOCATE SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW BACK TO TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK IT WAS AT THE HEART OF YOUR QUESTION I THINK IT'S MOE ABOUT GOOD GOVERNANCE IS THEN. YOU KNOW AND ATTEMPTED TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S RETALIATORY. INFLAMMATORY IT'S JUST IN WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE GREAT AND I AND I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT IT'S OUR TALENT -- I'M JUST SAYING THAT I WANTED TO BE PERCEIVED AND I GET AIDS AGAIN IT'S JUST WE DON'T REQUIRE IT MY UNDERSTANDING IS RESEARCH CONSULTANT ADVICE WE DON'T REQUIRE THIS FOR ANY OTHER STATE AGENCY. THEY DON'T HAVE TO COME WITH US WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION NEGOTIATES ON WAIVERS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE ADMINISTRATION NEGOTIATES THESE WAIVERS. AND SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND ONE OTHER TIME THAT WE REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME TO LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL TO NEGOTIATE A WAIVER. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ARMY VOTER RIGHTS ACT AS MATTER THERE'S THERE'S A TON OF THEM. HUESO I DON'T TO TIE THE HANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF. IT TAKES US AWHILE TO GET OUR OKAY WELL ANYTHING I ANDLET ME LET YOU KNOW LET ME KIND OF TAKE THAT AWAY AND THEN COME BACK TO YOU WITH. AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION HERE OKAY SIR MITCHELL MITCHELL. HELP ME RIGHT OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY I I WOULD JUST SAY IS IS THAT IT -- ACROSS VARIOUS AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS -- IN. AND ARE EXERCISING OUR OVERSIGHT THAT WE WILL ASK WHETHER IT'S RELATED WAIVERS OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. WE WILL WANT -- TO HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION IS THE REPORT BACK TO US WHAT THEY'RE DOING ALL ARE AT PARTICULAR CRITICAL TIMES ACTUALLY SEEK OUR APPROVAL ESPECIALLY IN THE INTERACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE MINISTRATION LEGISLATURE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE AND ACTUALLY I WOULD POINT OUT OF PROBABLY MENTION THAT AS A MEMBER OF THE MINORITY PARTY -- THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT WHEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO TO SAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO HEAD SAY SOMETHING BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT O OF REPUBLICANS -- NO THREE PEOPLE REGISTER FELL INTO OUR IN THE ADMINISTRATION WHO ARE GOING TO BE SPEAKING OUT SO WHEN HE COMES BACK TO US WE ALL HAVE A CHANCE TO COMMENT AND OUR OUR OUR OUR YOU KNOW OUR VIEWS KNOWN. AND CUT IT IN RELATION TO WHAT THE THE ADMINISTRATION MAY PROPOSE AND HER CONVERSATION WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS THEN.
