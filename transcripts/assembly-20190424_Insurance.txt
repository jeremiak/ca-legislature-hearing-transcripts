MURDER INSURANCE FROM BEING SOLD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THE NRA STARTED SELLING AN INSURANCE POLICY CALLED KERRY GUARD. AT COVERS CRIMINAL AND CIVIL DEFENSE IS FOR GUN OWNERS. WHO USE THEIR GUNS IN A SHOOTING GENERALLY SPEAKING GUN OWNERS CAN BE COVERED FOR LIABILITY UNDER THEIR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICIES? HAVING SAID THAT THIS INSURANCE GIVES OWNERS A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY ALLOWING THEM. TO SHOOT FIRST WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES -- SO GONNA SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SHOOT FIRST AND HAVE THEIR CRIMINAL THE FEES COVERED. ALSO WANT TO MAKE MENTION THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. AND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER EAST ISSUED A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER -- TO THE HONOR A FOR MARKETING -- THIS INSURANCE WITHOUT A LICENSE AND THIS WAS PRESS RELEASE CAME OUT ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WITH YOUR PERMISSION MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A FEW PROPS I MIGHT LIKE TO JUST HIGHLIGHT TO THIS COMMITTEE.

OF A DEFENSE SHOOTING. HOW MUCH SHOULD I SAY TO POLICE? AM I GOING TO BE DETAINED -- THIS BOARD HERE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH FOR POLICE THAT YOU WERE IN FEAR OF YOUR LIFE. AND THAT YOU DID. WHAT YOU FELT WAS NECESSARY TO NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT? YOUR TO ESTABLISH YOUR DEFENSIVE ROLE AND SO I THINK THIS FALSELY GIVES AS THE SENSE THAT. EACH SHOOT FIRST AND WE'RE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES LATER. AND AS YOU WELL KNOW AS AS REFLECTED IN THE COMING OUT THIS -- A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES ALREADY PREVENT SUCH TYPE OF INSURANCE -- SO AGAIN WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE. A SENSE OF DUTY -- WITH RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERSHIP AND WITH RESPECT TO ASKS FOR DRIVE OUT. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MISTER LOW.

THE INEQUITY IN CURRENT LAW WHICH PROVIDES A LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFICERS WITH FORTY EIGHT FIFTY TIME CANNOT BE RESOLVED THROUGH. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN KERN HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFICERS RECEIVED FORTY EIGHT FIFTY TIME.

AND AGAIN THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION IS A SUPPORT POSITION. THANK YOU ALL [inaudible] FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. AND MISS BURKE IS HERE SO LET'S PROCEED WITH MS BURKE'S BELL. AND WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST STAR. ON THIS BILL THIS IS A RARE. THIS IS A RARITY. A RARE MOMENT IN INSURANCE COMMITTEE [inaudible] HISTORY [inaudible] MISS [inaudible] MS. TRACKING I'M NOT TRYING TO EMBARRASS YOU NOT BRIAN. HEALTH IS NOW MADE IT NOW LAST NIGHT THE ANY BEFORE MUSIC 454% OF BILLS -- TO BRING IN ALL THIS IS GOOD. YEAH WALK UP MUSIC. IT'S LIKE BASEBALL ERROR -- MS BURKE'S BILL IS AB -- SEVEN FORTY GO AHEAD MR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. I AND BEHALF OF THE CO AUTHORS ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY LOVE AND QUIRK TO PRESENT AB SEVEN FORTY THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CHANGE CATASTROPHE FIND. NEARLY THIRTY TWO THOUSAND FAMILIES HAVE LOST THEIR HOME CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND INSURANCE HAS PROVIDED RESOURCES TO REBUILD AFTER THE DISASTERS HAVE STRICKEN. ACCORDING TO VICE PRESIDENT UNDERWRITING AND OPERATIONS AT THE FAIR PLAN THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF CALIFORNIANS SEEKING INSURANCE COVERAGE WOULD BE A FAIR PLAN. IN FACT IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS COVERED BY FAIR PAM PAPA BEAR PLAN POLICIES IN THE WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE HAS GROWN BY 35%. AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE LAST TWO COULD HAVE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. THE FAIR PLAN DOES NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS FOR THIS YEAR BUT IN SOME HIGHER IS COUNTIES THEY'RE RUNNING 3100% AHEAD OF LAST YEAR. AND ALTHOUGH FAIR PLAN IS AN INSURANCE POOL ESTABLISHED BY INSURANCE CODE IN STATUTE MOST INDIVIDUALS ON FAIR PLAN PAY HIGHER RATES AND ARE TYPICALLY UNDER INSURED. EXACERBATING THE HARDSHIP OF WELFARE VICTIMS IS THE FACT THAT CATASTROPHIC RELATED WILDFIRE LAWSUITS CAN LAST BETWEEN SEVEN AND NINE YEARS. AND THE CONSTRUCTION DEMAND AND PRICING SEARCHES ARE RENDERING HOMEOWNERS UNDERINSURED BY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. AFTER ENTIRE COMMUNITIES ARE DESTROYED. AB SEVEN FORTY AS A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT WILDFIRE INSURANCE AND UTILITY STABILITY. THE GOAL OF THE FIND IS TO PROTECT UTILITY RATE PAIRS FROM INCURRING EXCESSIVE RATE INCREASES AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED WILDFIRE AND CLIMATE CHANGE DISASTERS. EXPEDITE VICTIMS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE RECOVERY. ENCOURAGE INSURANCE TO PROVIDE IMPROVED QUALITY FAIR PLAN OPTIONS AND WRAPAROUND POLICIES AND WILL STILL HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE. WE ARE NOT THE FIRST STATE TO UTILIZE A FINE TO DEAL WITH CATASTROPHES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE FOR AS HAS UTILIZED A SIMILAR MODEL WASHINGTON AND OTHER STATES ARE CURRENTLY ALSO EXPLORING FUNDS FOR WILDFIRES AND OTHER CATASTROPHES. AS WE'RE ALL AWARE THE GOVERNOR WRIST WRIST RELEASED HIS STRIKE FORCE REPORT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO. WHICH DETAILED EFFORTS CALIFORNIA MUST TAKE IN ORDER TO RECOVER FROM CA TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AND HOLD UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE WHILE ALSO STABILIZING THEM TO MEET THE ENERGY NEEDS OF CONSUMERS AND THE ECONOMY. ONE SUCH CONCEPT OUTLINED IS A FUND THAT WOULD CREATE A BUFFER TO ABSORB A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF WILDFIRE LIABILITY COSTS THAT POTENTIALLY COULD OTHERWISE BE DIRECTLY PASSED ON TO REPAIRS. ADDITIONALLY THE STRIKE FORCE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN CONSULTATION WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE GOVERNOR EXPLORE WHETHER OR NOT ENSURE SHOULD BE OBLIGATED. TO OFFER CONSUMERS WERE IN ELIGIBLE FOR HOMEOWNER POLICIES EITHER A DIFFERENCE IN CONDITION OUR PREMISES LIABILITY POLICIES AS COMPLEMENTARY COVERAGE FOR A FAIR PLAN FIRE POLICY. AB SEVEN FORTY IS BEING CRAFTED IN A WAY THAT WAS FONT TO THESE CHALLENGES. VICTIMS AND THE STATE NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE AND WE NEED TO DO THIS EXPEDITIOUSLY. WE NEED UTILITIES TO CONTINUE TO MITIGATE A RECTIFY THE STANDING IN CALIFORNIA WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT WE ALL NEED TO PLAY A PART IN THIS RECOVERY. TRADITIONALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOCIALIZING THE COST OF WILD FIRES WE THINK OF REPAIRS. HOWEVER MOST AGREE THAT THE SOCIALIZATION ACOSTA MUST BE GO BEYOND WHILE REPAIRS. EVERY MAJOR STAKEHOLDER MUST ALSO PLAY A PART IN THE SOLUTION UTILITIES INSURANCE AND THE STATE. OUR GOAL WITH THIS BILL IS TO WRITE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION THAT ULTIMATELY PROVIDE STABILITY NOT ONLY DO UTILITIES BUT REPAIRS AS WELL AS WILD FIRE VICTIMS. THIS IS OUR CALL TO ACTION AND THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY CONVERSATIONS AND DEBATES THAT WE WON'T HAVE AMONGST OURSELVES AND STAKEHOLDERS. TOLD UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE WHILE WORKING TO MAKE VICTIMS HALL. AND TRYING NOT TO DO THIS ON THE SOUL AT THE SOLE EXPENSIVE REPAIRS. THIS IS A DIRECT AND TIMELY SOLUTION FOR THOSE IMPACTED BY WILDFIRES. FINALLY AB SEVEN FORTY ALSO ARE SO RIGHT AUTHORIZES THE COMMISSION TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE USE OF THE FUND FOR OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED CATASTROPHES AS DEFINED BY THE GOVERNOR. WE WERE NOT PREPARED FOR THE PASSED CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES LET'S NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN WITH OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE CATASTROPHES. MEMBERS THE FACE OF THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE THOSE OF THE VICTIMS. THE GOAL FIRST AND FOREMOST OF ANY WHILE FINE WILDFIRE FUND SHOULD BE TO PROTECT ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE VICTIMS NOT THE UTILITIES. STABILIZING UTILITIES SHOULD BE THE BY PRODUCT OF WHAT EVER WE DO. I BELIEVE ONLY THEN CAN WE COME UP WITH AN APPROPRIATE AND COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION ONE THAT WE CAN ALL STAND BEHIND. WITH THAT I TURN IT OVER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. THANK YOU. MISS BURKE AHEAD MISTER WOOD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE FOR ASKING ME TO JOIN HER HERE TODAY AND WE LEARNED A LOT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE TUBS FIRE WHICH WAS IN MY DISTRICT UP. ALSO MENDOCINO COUNTY FIRES WE'VE HAD. SOME THE LESSONS IN RETROSPECT SEEM KIND OF OBVIOUS BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO'VE NEVER LIVED TO AN EVENT LIKE THE TUBS FIRE. THEY CAME AS A PRETTY RUDE AWAKENING. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IN YOUR HOME JUST YOUR HOME BURNS DOWN IT'S RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH IT WILL COST TO REBUILD. DO YOU BUY INSURANCE FOR THAT AMOUNT AND YOU MAY BE BY A LITTLE BIT MORE IF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT AND THAT ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE YOU CAN ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU REALLY NEED. PERFECT YOUR HOUSE AND FIVE THOUSAND OTHER HOUSES IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD BURNED DOWN ALL IN ONE NIGHT. THE COST OF YOU TO REBUILD YOUR HOME LOOKS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR SIX MONTHS AFTER THE TOP FIRE THE AVERAGE COST OF CONSTRUCTION LABOR MATERIALS INCREASED 30%. THIS IS ON TOP OF THE INCREASED COST TO DESIGN AND BUILD AND PLAN YOUR HOME. OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF I'VE MET WITH CONSTITUENTS HAVE BEEN QUOTED MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND 522100% OF THE ESTIMATE IS PER SQUARE. FOOT COST TO REBUILD ABOVE WHAT WHAT WHAT THE NORMAL RATE WAS BEFORE THE FIRE. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD MAINTAIN THE RECOMMENDED LEVELS OF INSURANCE BEFORE THE FIRE -- BUT BECAUSE THE SUDDEN DEMAND FOR SUPPLIES AND LABOR MOST OF WHICH WERE IN SHORT SUPPLY ALREADY THE EFFECTIVELY BECAME UNDERINSURED MEANT MEN MANY WAYS GROSSLY UNDERINSURED OVERNIGHT. I REALIZE IT'S AN INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND THERE'S A LOT TO CONSIDER HERE BUT I BELIEVE THE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAVING AROUND -- A. B. SEVEN FORTY OF NEEDED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT TODAY SO WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. MY DISTRICT AND MANY OTHER DISTRICTS NOW IN CALIFORNIA SINCE THE FIRES ARE STARTING OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH THANK YOU. MR WOULD THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME. TO TO SUPPORT THIS BILL -- YOU AND I HAVE HAD A NUMBER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE IMPACTS. IN YOUR DISTRICT AND I KNOW YOU'RE VERY VERY HANDS ON IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH BOTH TODAY'S CHALLENGES AS WELL AS ANTICIPATING CHALLENGES DOWN THE ROAD AND MISS BURKE -- ALSO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING A THE BIG PICTURE BIG IDEA BILL FORWARD AND THE CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING A SUPPORT POSITION AND DO YOU HAVE ANYONE ELSE WHO WILL BE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL. LET'S LET'S GIVE FOLKS AN OPPORTUNITY -- IS OR ANYONE HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ARE THERE ANY PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. THERE DON'T APPEAR TO BE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS QUESTIONS MR MAYES AS QUESTION. ON NOT QUESTION -- I JUST WANT TO THAT IS SAFE IF WHEN WE GET ESTABLISH A QUORUM I'D LIKE TO BUILD MAKE A MOTION ON ON THIS -- THIS BILL -- BIKE TO FRIENDS -- DOCTOR WOULD WHO SERVE THEM AND I DON'T WANT CONFERENCE COMMITTEE I WITH ME AND THEN WITH THE SOME OF OUR BURKE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. A LAST YEAR IN REGARDS TO TO THESE ISSUES AND SHE SPENT AND IT AND ACCEPT AMOUNT OF TIME NOT JUST LAST YEAR BUT EVEN THIS YEAR. ON UNDERSTANDING THE CUP HOW COMPLEX THIS ACTUALLY IS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT DENY. I WANT TO SAY THAT MOST DON'T REALIZE THAT THERE IS -- AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT AND I KNOW THAT'S AN OVER USED TERM HERE BUT THERE IS AN EXISTENTIA THREAT THAT HAS TO BE HAS TO BE ADDRESSED -- AND AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO AS A LEGISLATURE -- AS THE STATE GOVERNMENT I WORK TOGETHER IN A BIPARTISAN WAY A TO BE ABLE -- TO TO TO COME UP WITH A REAL SOLUTION AND SO THIS IS PART OF THE OVERALL CONVERSATION I WAS YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR BROWN DID COME UP WITH -- HIS REPORT -- A FEW WEEKS AGO AND THERE WAS -- NOT A WHOLE LOT OF DETAILS -- IN IN THAT REPORT AND SO IT IS GOING TO BE LEFT UP TO US I THINK TO WORK THROUGH ALL OF THAT AND SO I WANT TO THINK. ABOUT DOCTOR WOULD IT IS SUMMER BURKE BOB AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. LET'S SO WE IF THEY APPEAR TO HAVE A QUORUM LET'S TAKE ROLL REAL QUICK SO WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND THEN. GET YOUR BILL PASSED. DALY HERE MAYES. YOUR BERMAN. BIGELOW. CALDERON. CHEN [inaudible] TO COOLEY. COOPER. FRAZIER [inaudible] GIPSON [inaudible] GRAYSON [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE [inaudible] VOEPEL. IN NINETEEN PERFORMED. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS COMMITTEE -- MEANS YES. YOUR MEANS HERE EXCUSE ME. IT MEANS HERE AND YES THE BILL. THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND -- TO PASS THIS BILL MISTER FRAZIER HAS A QUESTION OR COMMENT YEAH. THANK YOU BOTH OF YOU FOR TAKING ON THIS -- THIS -- THIS ISSUE WITH SO AND SO OVERWHELMING I KNOW -- ONE OF THE THINGS IT SHOWS IN ESTABLISHING THE COMMISSION -- I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD INCLUDE. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE DID -- ALLOCATING TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TOWARDS THE EFFORT. WHICH IS FAR SHORT OF WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. YOU KNOW A BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS I THINK THEY NEED TO BE A STAKEHOLDER IN THIS SO THAT THEY GET SKIN IN THE GAME. BECAUSE EVERY EVERY TIME THAT WE HAVE THESE WILDFIRES SUCH AS BACK. TO ZERO AND SO IF THERE INVESTMENT IS MADE TO SUIT THROUGH THERE DID YOU ARE UP FUND OR WHATEVER IT IS. THE MORE THEY'RE IN IN TUNE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON THE BETTER OFF WE ARE WITH THEIR INVESTMENT AND I I WOULD HOPE THAT IT BACK TO BE IN A MOMENT AND AND I'M REALLY OPEN TO THAT WE DO HAVE ON THE CURRENT BOARD AT CLIMATE CHANGE EXPERTS SO I THINK. THAT THAT WOULD BE IT. PREGNANT I THINK I CAN. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE COMMISSION. MR VOEPEL. JUST ON MY COLLEAGUES KNOW I SPENT NINE YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY WHEN SAILORS MUSTER IN ON DECK IT'S CO. GOOD GOOD MISTER COOPER.

FOURTEEN HUNDRED THIS BILL WILL ENSURE CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES OF A CITY COUNTY OR SPECIAL DISTRICT WHO ARE EXPOSED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. TO ACTIVE FIRES OR PERCENTAGE CARCINOGENIC. MATERIALS FROM FIREFIGHTING OPERATIONS RECEIVE FULL MEDIA AND DISABILITY COVERAGE IF THEY DEVELOP CANCER THAT HAS BEEN LINKED TO EXPOSURE TO FIRES BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED TO DETERMINE FIREFIGHTERS ELIGIBILITY. FOR PRESUMPTIVE COVERAGE IN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE. THE CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES SERVE AND COUNTY FIRE SERVICE OUTFITS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AS FIRE MECHANICS FIRE EQUIPMENT MECHANICS AND OTHER MECHANIC WORKERS. I JUST WANT TO DEVIATE FROM MY NOTES FOR A LITTLE BIT. TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL MY EXPERIENCE IS -- MEETING FIRE PERSONNEL -- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR ONE OF THE FACILITIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I LEARNED IN WHAT I SAW. THE FIRE EQUIPMENT THAT THE FIRE PERSON NOW [inaudible] MAINTAIN. AN OPERATE. AND KEEP IN. THE FINE STANDING CONDITIONS SO THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS CAN GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND PROTECT COMMUNITIES. HOW PROPERTY AND OTHER PERSON NOW? IS REALLY CRITICAL -- AND THESE FIRE PERSONNEL FACE GRAVE HAZARDOUS DANGERS EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY'RE WORKING ON TRUCKS. THAT HAVE TUBES AND HOSES THAT ARE FULL OF ASBESTOS THAT THEY ARE TOUCHING IN DEALING WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY. THEY ARE CLEANING EQUIPMENT. THAT HAS BODY LEE FLUID AND TISSUE ON THEM FROM THE FIRES THAT THEY ARE GOING OUT WALL FROM THE FIRES THAT FIREFIGHTERS ARE GOING OUT -- TO FIGHT AND THEN BRING THAT EQUIPMENT BACK TO BE CLEAN WE KNOW THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS WHO SUPPORT -- WE SUPPORT ALL THE TIME HAVE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ON THEIR USING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE PROTECTIVE GEAR THEY GO THROUGH A DECONTAMINATION PROCESS THESE THAT ARE FIRE PERSONNEL DO NOT ENJOY IN FACT WHEN THEY ARE TAKING CARE OF THIS EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF THE TRUCKS. THEY'RE WEARING THEIR GENERAL UNIFORMS ANY THEIR GLASSES OR FACE MASKS THAT YOU CAN BUY AT LOWES FOR A DOLLAR. NINETY NINE IT IS UNREASONABLE. TO ASSUME. THAT THE HAZARDS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PROTECT OUR FIREFIGHTERS FROM. ARE GOING TO MAGICALLY NOT IMPACT OUR FIRE PERSONNEL. IN FACT OUR FIRE PERSONNEL SUFFERED TWO DEATHS A YEAR. FROM CANCER AND CANCER RELATED DISEASES AS A RESULT OF THEIR WORK AND BEING IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH CARCINOGENS AND OTHER TOXIC MATERIALS BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT THEY DO [inaudible] I WAS. INFORMED OF A STORY. OF ONE OF THEIR COLLEAGUES RAY ORTIZ WHO WAS A FIRE PERSONNEL WORK THAT. AND HAD DECIDED AFTER YEARS. TO TAKE THE TESTS TO BECOME A FIREFIGHTER. AND ONLY THEN WHEN HE WAS GETTING HIS TESTS WAS IT REVEALED THAT HE HAD STAGE FOUR CANCER. FROM BEING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO CARCINOGENS OVER THE COURSE OF HIS WORK AS A FIRE PERSONNEL. RAY OR TEASE DIED. THE TWO GENTLEMEN. WHO TOWARD THE FACILITY WITH ME ARE CANCER SURVIVORS? THERE CANCER SURVIVORS. BECAUSE OF THE TOXINS THAT THEY INGEST NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BUT BECAUSE IT'S THEIR JOB. AND THEY'RE JUST ASKING FOR THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT ARE FIRE PUT THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS RECEIVE. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THE FIREMEN IN THE FIRE WOMEN ARE COMING BACK FROM THEIR WORK [inaudible] THE RESIDUE. OF THEIR PEROT SAYS THEM. IS WHAT OUR FIRE PERSONNEL. ARE CLEANING UP. AND SO THIS BILL WILL JUST BRING SOME I THINK VERY PRAGMATIC AND SENSIBLE PROTECTIONS. TO THE HEALTH IN THE SAFETY OF OUR FIRE PERSONNEL WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ALLOW MY TWO WITNESSES LOUISE DEL SAID A FIRE EQUIPMENT MECHANIC FROM LA COUNTY AND RUDY TORRES A FLEET MECHANIC. FROM MENLO PARK FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT TO SHARE THEIR STORIES. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS LOUISE THEY'LL SAY IT AND I HAVE BEEN A FIRE EQUIPMENT MECHANIC. FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. I'M ALSO EXTREMELY FORTUNATE TO BE HERE AS I AM ONE OF THE NINETEEN MEMBERS THAT WE KNOW OFTEN ARE SIXTY MAN FIRE MECHANIC UNIT WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER OVER THE PAST SEVENTEEN YEARS. FARM MECHANICS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE. IN ENSURING THAT THE EQUIPMENT USED BY FIREFIGHTERS IN OUR LOCAL COUNTY SAN SPECIAL DISTRICT A SERVICE. MAINTAIN A NEVER READY TO RESPOND TO THE GROWING NUMBER OF WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE. AS A FIRE EQUIPMENT MECHANIC I SPENT MY DAY SERVICING THE RIGS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT USED IN ACTIVE FIRES. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR ME AND MY COWORKERS TO SERVICE TRUCKS COME IN AND JUST AFTER RETURNING FROM ACT THE BLAZES COATED INSERT ANOTHER THE BRIEF [inaudible] IN FACT. SOMETIMES WE SERVICE VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT THAT HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THE HAVE RESPONDED TO NUMEROUS FIRES AND THE SASTRAS BEFORE THEY ARRIVE IN OUR FACILITY. AND ARE LITERALLY COVERED IN PARTICULAR MATTER FROM EVERYONE OF THOSE INCIDENTS. I'D LIKE TO STRESS THAT I LOVE MY JOB. WE ALL OF OUR JOB. IT ALLOWS FOR ME AND FOR US TO PROVIDE. FOR MY EXTRAORDINARY FAMILY. MY WIFE PATTY AND MY KIDS. I DEVELOP A BROTHERHOOD WITH THE GUYS IN OUR UNIT. AND I LOVE KNOWING THAT. WHAT I DO HELP SAVE LIVES IN LA COUNTY? HONESTLY UNTIL JUNE FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE IDEA THAT I COULD GET SICK FROM DOING WHAT I LOVE WHILE ALWAYS A REAL POSSIBILITY. IN OUR UNIT AS WE'VE HAD AT LEAST ONE DIAGNOSIS EVERY YEAR SINCE I WAS HIRED. WAS THE FURTHEST THING FROM MY MIND. ON THAT DATE JUNE FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH COLON CANCER AT THE AGE OF FORTY TWO AFTER RECEIVING THE DIAGNOSIS MY THOUGHTS IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO MY FAMILY. WHAT WILL MY WIFE THE WITHOUT ME AROUND? HOW DO I TELL MY DAUGHTER? THAT THAT IT MIGHT NOT COME AROUND. TO SEE HER CHRIS MITCHELL. HOW DO I TELL MY BOYS? BUT I'M GONNA SEE HIM PLAY FOOTBALL [inaudible] I'M SORRY. BUT I ALSO STRUGGLE TO COME TO TERMS WITH HOW. THE BEST JOB I'VE EVER HAD EXPOSED ME TO TOXIC CHEMICALS. THAT LED TO MY CANCER DIAGNOSIS. MY THOUGHTS SHIFTED TO THOSE LONG HOURS SPENT WITH MY BROTHERS IN OUR MECHANICS GARAGE BREEDING IN THE DIESEL FUMES WITH IMPROPER VENTILATION. SERVICING TRUCKS COVERED IN SOOT FROM WHO KNOWS HOW MANY EMERGENCY CALLS. HAVING COMPARTMENT STRIP ON LOAN FLUIDS ON ME OR ON US DURING REPAIRS WITH NO STANDARD ISSUE PROTECTIVE GEAR. ONLY LIKE THE GLOVE SOME PAINTERS MASS. WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE? WORKING ON FIRELINES WITH FIREFIGHTERS TO MAINTAIN AND REPAIR THEIR EQUIPMENT. WITHOUT THEIR STAND THE PROTECTIVE GEAR AND BREATHING APPARATUS TO MINIMIZE THE EXPOSURE TO CANCER CAUSING AGENTS IN THE SMOKE. WE OFTEN THINK OF OF OF THE SMOKE FROM ACTIVE FIRES AS CANCER CAUSING AGENTS. BUT A TWO THOUSAND SIX META ANALYSIS OF THIRTY TWO CANCER STUDIES BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI COLLEGE OF MEDICINE SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE DANGERS OF THEIR MONTHS OUR ABSORPTION. OR TOXINS ARE ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN. THIS IS A UNIQUE REYES FOR US AS MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK EVERYDAY WITH OUR HANDS WITHOUT THE PROTECTIVE GEAR AND THE CONTAMINATION PROTOCOLS ASSIGNED TO OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE FIRE SERVICE. ON TV YOU SEE FIREFIGHTERS FIRE ENGINES LADDER TRUCKS FIREFIGHTING HELICOPTERS PARAMEDIC SQUADS AND PATROLS BUT WHAT YOU DON'T SEE. IS ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE. IN THE BACKGROUND LIKE US HELPING. TO MAKE IT ALL HAPPEN. WHAT YOU ALSO DON'T SEE ON TV IS THAT WE ALSO GET EXPOSED TO THE SAME CARCINOGEN AND? CARCINOGENS WHILE DOING OUR JOB TO HELP SAVE LIVES AND PROPERTY. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE FOR ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN HUNDRED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER DEL CID AND THERE'S ONE ADDITIONAL WITNESS GO AHEAD SIR. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S REALLY TORE AS I'M HERE IS A MEMBER OF ASKED ME COUNCIL FIFTY SEVEN IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I WORK IN A PARK FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT AS A FARMER CAN'T FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. IN MY DAILY ACTIVITIES AT WORK THERE ARE TWO OF US IN THE GARAGE. WE'RE WE'RE EXPOSED ALL SMELLS CHEMICALS A COME BACK FROM THE FIRES WERE REPAIRING MAINTAINING FIRE ENGINES AND EQUIPMENT USED ON THESE FIRES. WE'RE TOUCHING IT WE'RE BREATHING IT. WHEN SHE COMES BACK FROM FIRE IT CAN BE OFF GASSING FOR WEEKS MEANING THAT GARAGE SMELLS LIKE AN ACTIVE FIRE? WE HAVE ONE HEAVY RESCUE SEVEN FRONT LINE OF FIRE ENGINES THREE RESERVES THREE LADDER TRUCKS OVER FIRE PER OVER THIRTY FIVE PERSONAL VEHICLES A WATER RESCUE EQUIPMENT FEMA EQUIPMENT -- YES EQUIPMENT TO REPAIR AND MAINTAIN IT AT ALL TIMES. WE'RE ON CALL TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AND AT TIMES ALSO GET SENT OUT TO ACTIVE FIRES. ON THE FIRE LINE I'M EXPOSED TO HARMFUL CHEMICALS IMPERIALS MUCH IN THE SAME WAY MY FIREFIGHTER COLLEAGUES ARE. THERE BEEN CASES WHEN THE FIRE ENGINE HAS BEEN PUMPING SO MUCH WATER FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME THAT I MASTER WITH DONNING MY TURNOUT GEAR AND ENTERING A HOT ZONE TO REVEAL AN ENGINE WHILE FIREFIGHTERS ARE FIGHTING THE FIRE. AT THE SAN BRUNO FIRE EXPLOSION. I WAS FUELING ENGINES REPAIRING -- ENGINES SOME THAT WOULD NOT START AND THEN WAS TASKED WITH PUMPING WATER OUT OF THE HOLE AT THE SEVERAL FIRE EXPLOSION. THAT THE IT BLEW OUT OF THE GROUND. TO HELP SECURE THE WATER MAINS GAS LINE RATE MAINS ISSUE SEWER LINE MAINS -- THIS CAN ALL BE SEEN ON GOOGLE IMAGES OF THE DISASTER -- THERE'S A BLUE POP IN A RED TRUCK AND I'M I'M THE ONE PUMP THE WATER OUT OF THAT EXPLOSION.

I ALSO HAVE MY MEDICAL HISTORY WAS IN TWENTY TEN WAS DIAGNOSED WITH TESTICULAR CANCER. AND HAD ONE REMOVED FOLLOWING THAT HAD BLOOD WORK IN CT SCANS FROM CHEST UNEASE EVERY SIX MONTHS. THEN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THEY SAID MY CANCER MARKERS START GOING UP AND THAT SHOULD CONSIDER GOING TO THROUGH CHEMO. TO KILL THE CELLS BEFORE THEY SPREAD SO I DID. I WENT THROUGH CHEMO EIGHT HOURS A DAY FIVE DAYS A WEEK FOR FOUR MONTHS. CAME -- BECAME MY FULL TIME JOB FOR FOUR MONTHS.

HAVING SIMILAR. WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO ME AND MY FAMILY ONLY SEEMS TO BE FAIR. I WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE WORRY THAT COMES WITH A RISK EXPOSURE. PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL.

GOOD MORNING THIS CHAIR MASSAGER MEMBERS MY NAME IS HARRY WONG. I'M ALSO PRESIDENT OF ASKED ME LOCAL. ONE NINETEEN OR FOR LOSS SAID JUST COUNTY FIRE. BY MECHANICS. ABILIFY MECHANIC.

GARY HAJJ LA COUNTY FARM MECHANIC AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. EVERITT BURGERS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION AN ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS THE ENTIRE ASPECT OF THE FIRE SERVICE CAREER UNION. VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND THE FIVE YEAR FIREFIGHTER SEASONAL I CAN TELL YOU THAT. WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS EXACT INTEREST NAY DESERVE THE SAME PROTECTION THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ARE THERE ANY PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THIS BILL. PLEASE GO AHEAD GO AHEAD ANNA. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS STATE POOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IS HERE TODAY AND VERY RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION OF AB. FOURTEEN HUNDRED CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS A NO FAULT SYSTEM DESIGNED TO FAVOR ANY WORKER WHO CLAIMS THAT INJURY OR ILLNESS IS WORK RELATED. LABOR CODE SECTION THIRTY TWO OH TWO REQUIRES THAT CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION STATUTES QUOTE SHALL BE LIBERALLY CONSTRUED BY THE COURTS WITH THE PURPOSE OF EXTENDING THEIR BENEFITS FOR THE PROTECTION. OF PERSONS INJURED IN THE COURSE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM PROVIDES GENEROUS BENEFITS TO FIREFIGHTERS WHO WERE DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. MEDICAL EVIDENCE IS LINKED EXCESSIVE EXPOSURE TO CARCINOGENS WITH CANCER SO FIREFIGHTERS DO NOT NEED TO DEMONSTRATE WORK CAUSATION FOR RELATED WORK COMPENSATION BENEFITS. INSTEAD THESE INJURIES AND ILLNESSES ARE PRESUMED UNDER THEIR WORK TO BE RELATED TO THE EXPOSURE THAT THEY HAVE FIGHTING A FIRE FIGHTER OPERATIONS. SINCE THESE INJURIES ARE PRESUMED TO BE INDUSTRIAL COMPENSATION AWARDED FOR THESE INJURIES INCLUDES FULL HOSPITAL SURGICAL MEDICAL TREATMENT DISABILITY INDEMNITY PAYMENTS AND DEATH BENEFITS. AN EXISTING LAW SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL FROM THE PRESUMPTION THAT CANCER IS INDUSTRIAL BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF ENGAGING AND FIRE SUPPRESSION RESCUE OR THE PROTECTION OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. BECAUSE AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED EXPANDS THE QUALIFICATIONS OF CANCER PRESUMPTION BENEFITS FROM FIREFIGHTERS. TO AN UNCLEAR FIRE SERVICE PERSONNEL WITHOUT CLEARLY DEFINING THE CLASSIFICATIONS THIS INCLUDES. THIS WOULD GRANT PRESUMPTIONS TO NON PUBLIC SAFETY POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT EXPOSED TO THE SAME. SAFETY OR HEALTH HAZARDS. WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE ON A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT PRESUMPTION ELIGIBILITY THAT EXAMINE STRONG PREVENTATIVE SAFETY MEASURES AND THE COST IN IMPACTS THAT SUCH CHANGES WOULD HAVE ON OUR INJURED WORKERS AND ON LOCAL BUDGETS PRIOR TO FURTHER EXPANSION. HOWEVER AT THIS TIME WE'RE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. THANK YOU GO AHEAD SIR. JOSH DUGGAR REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE CONCERNS OF THE ASSOCIATION JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES -- WHAT WE TRULY APPRECIATE THE BRAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO RISK THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY FIGHTING FIRES WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION? ON THE EXISTING PRESUMPTIONS WERE DELIBERATELY AND NARROWLY CRAFTED FOR ONLY THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING THAT IT'S GOING. TO WORK ACTIVITIES -- IT'S UNCLEAR WHY THE EXISTING WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS INSUFFICIENT OR INADEQUATE AND COVERING CASES WHERE THERE IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING WHERE IT IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING THAT THE ILLNESS OR INJURY IS PROVED TO BE CAUSED BY THE WORK ACTIVITY. MEANING IT DOESN'T IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A PRESUMPTION TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. FINALLY WHILE WE WHILE IT IS A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THIS PRESUMPTION WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT INVESTIGATIVE DUTIES OF FOUR OR AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO CIVIL LIABILITY FOR LOCAL. GOVERNMENT EMPLOYERS AND POTENTIAL MISUSES OF A PUBLIC FUNDS [inaudible] THANK YOU. GO AHEAD THE WESTERN MEMBERS AT JASON FALTER HERE ABOUT HALF OF CALIFORNIA COALITION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION AND SSDI SACK ACCESS INSURANCE AUTHORITY -- IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED [inaudible] COOL. ARE THERE ANY OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THIS BILL. IF NOT OF MISS. KAMLAGER-DOVE OF THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO SUMMARIZE AND ALSO -- ADDRESS THE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE THAT -- WE HAVE DISCUSSED. IF YOU DO THAT I WILL LET RYAN ALISON ADDRESS -- THE RESPONSES TO THE OPPOSITION AND HAVE A QUOTE. MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRTH BOB O'BRIEN OFTEN BEHALF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES OF SPONSORED BILL. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE INITIAL DRAFT -- WAS FAR TOO BROAD -- WE ARE AGREED WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK -- FOR THE REMARKABLE ANALYSIS -- WE WE AGREED TO TAKE A MOMENTOUS THAT ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT DESK EMPLOYEES OR EMPLOYEE TO DO NOT HAVE EXPOSURE TO ACTIVE. THE HEALTH HAZARDS OF FIRES RESULT AND OR OR RESULTING FROM ACTIVE FIRES OF THE POINT IS. TO INSURE THAT WE ARE CRAP CRAFTING A VERY TIGHT CIRCLE AROUND EMPLOYEES OR WITH SPECIFIC EXPOSURE WE INTENDED -- AND AND WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS REFERENCED IN THE ANALYSIS ARE THAT WE ARE -- TAKING AMENDMENTS MOVING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TO CLARIFY THAT. AND I WOULD JUST CLOSE BY SAYING -- THAT THIS FLEET THAT I VISITED. CALLED ON FIFTY RESEARCHERS TO CALM. AND STUDY THE CLIMATE THE WORK CLIMATE. TO GIVE THEM ADDITIONAL DATA ON THE HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY WORK. AND FIFTY RESEARCHERS. THROUGH THEIR SUPERVISORS DECLINED TO COME TO VISIT THE FACILITIES BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF CARCINOGENS AND TOXINS AND IF THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE WORK CONDITIONS OF THESE WORKERS THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES. AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED WOULD HAVE THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF EXTENDING FULL MEDICAL DEATH AND DISABILITY COVERAGE TO SPECIFIC WORKERS WITH CANCER DIAGNOSES RESULTING FROM DUTY EXPERIENCE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SO -- WHERE THINGS STAND IS THE CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL? AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN AGREED TO AS DESCRIBED BY MISTER ALLISON AND COMMITTED TO BY MISS CALM WATER DOVE -- I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE. AND LET'S GIVE -- MISTER GRAYSON OPPORTUNITY AND MISTER GIBSON OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND FIRST I JUST WANT TO STATE -- THAT THESE EMPLOYEES ARE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF WHAT MANY IN SOCIETY LOOK TO OUR AS HEROES AND THAT'S OUR FIREFIGHTERS. BUT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB THEY DO AND ENJOY THE STATUS OF A HERO IF IT WASN'T FOR THE GOOD WORK OF THESE EMPLOYEES THAT MAINTAIN THE EQUIPMENT -- THAT FIREFIGHTERS SHOES. AND I ALSO WANT TO STATE THAT -- IT WAS MADE A COMMENT WAS MADE ABOUT HOW FIREFIGHTERS HAVE THE PROTECTIVE GEAR AND THESE EMPLOYEES DON'T. EVEN WITH THE PROTECTIVE GEAR OUR FIREFIGHTERS ARE BECOMING -- VICTIMS AT A VERY HIGH RATE TO CANCER BASED ON JOB RELATED EXPOSURE SO WITH THAT -- I JUST WANT TO ASK A QUESTION AND A POINT WILL BE MADE OUT OF THIS QUESTION -- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A FIREFIGHTER GOES -- TO SCENE AND PUTS OUT A FIRE THEY COME BACK TO THE STATION WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FIREFIGHTERS CLOTHING ONCE THEY ARRIVE BACK AT THE STATION SO -- TO MY MY MY UNDERSTANDING MISTER GRAYSON IS THAT -- IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT DOES -- MET THOSE CLOTHES THAT CLOTHING -- CONTAINS A CARCINOGENIC MATERIALS FROM THE FIRES -- AND THOSE ARE CARCINOGENIC MATERIALS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED -- BY -- THE CURRENT STATUTE BY THE INTERNATIONAL AGENCY OF OUR RESEARCH THAT ON CANCER HAS IDENTIFIED AT A LIST OF ACTIVE CARCINOGENS AND BECAUSE OF THAT FIREFIGHTERS ARE REQUIRED. TO DEPOSIT THEIR TURNOUT GEAR INTO -- BAGS THAT ARE OFTEN SHIPPED OFF TO PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT DISCARD OF THESE MATERIALS OF OF APPROPRIATELY SO THEY'RE TREATED IN A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS WAY CORRECT. FULL THE CONTAMINATION PROCESS AND IN THEM THEIR UNIFORMS ARE PUT INTO A VERY SECURE BACK AND IMMEDIATELY TAKEN OFF. SO THESE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE NOW MAINTAINING THIS EQUIPMENT THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT BACK FROM THE SAME SCENE. THAT THESE FIREFIGHTERS COME BACK FROM WHOSE CLOTHING IS CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS AT THIS POINT. THEY'RE EXPOSED TO THE SAME CARCINOGENS WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR CLOTHING. THEY'RE WEARING UNIFORMS THAT YOU WOULD SEE YOUR MECHANIC HAVE WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR CAR TO THE AUTO BODY SHOP THEY ARE PUTTING ON GLASSES THAT YOU CAN BUY AT ANY -- HOME IMPROVEMENT STORE THERE ARE WEARING MASKS THAT YOU CAN BUY AT ANY PAINT STORE SO THE FIREFIGHTERS CLOSE GET SHIPPED OFF TO A HAZMAT PLACE. THE MAINTENANCE WORKERS CLOSED GOES HOME A GETS WASHED WITH THE KIDS CLOTHES PRECISELY. OKAY SO WITH THAT WHAT -- TO WHAT WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE BILL WHO ARE RECOVERING -- IS FAR AS THE THE NUMBER OF IS A PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OR IS THAT EVERYBODY WHO LIAM WHO ARE RECOVERING POTENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE REFERRING TO A CIVILIAN. EMPLOYEES WITH EXPOSURE AND AND AND THAT WOULD IN OUR ESTIMATION BE MECHANIC -- CLASSIFICATIONS OF AND THESE ARE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES -- EMPLOYED BY CITIES COUNTIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS HAVE PERCENTAGE WISE COMPARED TO FIREFIGHTERS WATER WHICH I WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE WE TALKING A BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT A THIRTY THIRD. ONE RETURN ONE RATIO LOTS OF THE FIREFIGHTERS TO MECHANICS SO I HEARD THAT WOULD BE ABOUT A ONE POINT 5%. YEAH FIGURES THAT CORRECT IN TERMS OF TOTAL COSTS THROUGH SYSTEM WE ESTIMATE THAT -- THE NUMBER IS LIKELY TO BE -- IN LA COUNTY SPECIFICALLY WERE TALKING CORRECT I THANK YOU. HAPPENS IT HAPPENS A MISTER GIBSON AND THEN MR CHIU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN -- MISTER GRAYSON AND TOOK A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK BECAUSE I WAS GLAD TO THOSE IT'S OKAY -- BUT THEY NEED TO BE -- ASSN ADDRESS -- FIRST WHAT'S GOING TO SAY I APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I APPRECIATE NOW HER DURING OUR HOMEWORK BUT ALSO GOING OUT. TO THE ACTUAL FACILITIES AND IN DOING HER OWN INVESTIGATION BEFORE SHE ACTS OFF OF HIS BILL WHICH AGAIN SHOWS ME SHE'S VERY VERY THOROUGH AND THIS IS ALSO AN ISSUE THIS IS THE ISSUE. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND AND I THINK THIS BILL DOES JUST THAT -- AS MY COLLEAGUE WAS GRAYSON ALSO INDICATED AN ILLUSTRATED -- THAT THE SAME CARCINOGENS THAT FIREFIGHTERS JUST YOU KNOW TAKE OFF -- IS THE SAME ONES THAT THESE MECHANICS GO IN AND USE AND EXPOSE THEMSELVES -- TO ON A DAILY BASIS AND SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WORKMAN'S COMP WE APPRECIATE THOSE OF TESTIFIED -- WEPRAY YOUR HEALING -- SO THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO GROW UP OF WATCH OUR KIDS GROW UP AND SEE THEM PLAY BASEBALL OR FOOTBALL INTO ALL THE THINGS -- THAT A FATHER -- EXPECT OF THEIR CHILDREN AND ALSO -- HUSBAND AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU OFFER SHE WOULD PLEASE CONSIDER INCLUDING ME AS A COUGH OF HIS BILL -- AND I WOULD CERTAINLY LOVE -- TO BE AT EVERY JUNCTURE -- TO HELP -- EVEN ON THE FLOOR OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ABSOLUTELY. MR CHIU GO AHEAD SIR. WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHARM OF FIRST OFF ALL THE ONE THANK YOU ALSO FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS ON SOUND THE CITY COUNCIL I DID VISIT WE'LL CALL THE OPERATION YARD WHICH MANY OF THOSE -- A YOU COULD MINTS ARE MAINTAINED AND SOON AFTER RIGHT I READ THE BILL I JUST REALLY FELT THAT THE THERE'S A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT SAFETY IMPROVE MY HEALTH. IMPROVEMENT THAT WE CAN MADE -- TO TO TO TO THE OPERATION YOU ARE IN THE WAY TO THE OPERATOR SO -- AND ALSO I'M JUST HOPING THAT THIS BILL WILL START A BIGGER CONVERSATION OF HOW CAN WE PREVENT. YOU KNOW GOOD GOES TO A THINGS TO HAPPEN LIKE REQUIRE. ANYBODY TO GO TO A FIRE LINE. TWO HOUSES CERTAIN PROTECTIVE GEAR. AND AND AND ALSO -- THE LEGACY IMPROVE OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL YARD. SO -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS MOTION. A MISTER MASON SKEWS ME MR MAYES AS QUESTION THEN MISTER COOPER WELL JUST A QUICK A QUICK COMMENT -- I MAY BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL -- TODAY I AM SYMPATHETIC. TO THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT A BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR WORKERS COMP -- A PROGRAM IS -- FINANCIALLY -- HEALTHY -- I DO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL FORD -- AND I THINK IT IS A NECESSARY -- BILL WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE -- THAT -- WE WE WE WE DON'T CONTINUE DOWN THE ROAD -- TO TOO FAR BUT I THINK YOU'VE MADE -- YOUR CASE -- TODAY AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL MISTER COOPER. ONE THING THE OFFERING THIS BILL FORD IT'S IT'S MUCH WITHOUT ANOTHER FACT -- AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WE CLEAN UP A LITTLE LABS LE METH LABS AND DRUG LABS. AND FOR THE SUPPORT PERSONNEL THAT COME OUT AND HELP THEIR ISSUE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE GEAR. THEY HAVE THAT IS THE STANDARD BY OSHA SO THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE AND WE DO KNOW THESE -- CANCER CAUSING CARCINOGENS SAME WORDS BUT IT'S UP NETWORKS OBVIOUS THEIR SUPPORT STAFF IS A IS A BIG PART OF ANY PUBLIC SAFETY ENDEAVOR. AND WILL MAKE SURE THEY'RE GIVEN THE PROPER TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT TO DO THEIR JOB AND I DO BELIEVE I MEAN FIVE FIRST COME BACK THERE CLOTHING IS LOST THAT'S THEIR CONTRACT. THE WATER TURNOUT GEAR. SO IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH NEEDED AND AS WELL THANK YOU FOR BEING A FORWARD THANK YOU THE FIREFIGHTERS CERTAINLY CAN'T GO OUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE TRUCKS AND THE EQUIPMENT NEEDED AND WE CERTAINLY WANT THEM OUT ALL THE TIME.

COOPER I FRAZIER. GIPSON. GIPSON I GRAYSON. GRAYSON ICON WATER DOES HI KAMLAGER-DOVE I VOEPEL. ALL RIGHT THAT PASSES A WITH TEN VOTES. A CLEAR MAJORITY THANK YOU MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE MISTER ALLISON AS WELL THANK YOU -- I THINK -- MS GONZALEZ IS. NEXT UP WITH TWO BILLS. TWO BILLS. ARE YOU GETTING ARE YOU GETTING ANY SLEEP THESE DAYS -- YEP YEP YEP. SORRY YOU LOOK WELL RESTED SO. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN I AM IF I CAN START WITH AB ONE NINETY SIX PAID FAMILY LEAVE I'M GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR. I'M PROUD RE SENDING A WOMEN'S CAUCUS PARTY BILL AB ONE NINETY SIX WHICH WOULD ENSURE WORKERS YOU SEEN -- CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM CAN RECIEVE HUNT PERCENT WAGE REPLACEMENT DURING THE PERIOD OF THEIR LEAVE. THANK YOU -- THIS THIS REALLY JUST SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN WHO -- IT IN PARTICULAR WOMEN WHO ADD DON'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY I HAD TO LIVE ON 6270% OF THEIR INCOME EVAN IN FACT WE KNOW THAT THAT A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER CANNOT LIVE ON 70% OR INCOME. COULD ACTUALLY EXERCISE A RIGHT TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE BY HAVING A LARGER INCOME REPLACEMENT -- WITH THAT. GO AHEAD THANK YOU. I'M KINDA LIKE COLLISON NINE CO CHAIR OF THE STATE -- LIFTING CHILDREN FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY. TASK FORCE AND THIS BILL WAS AN URGENT PRIORITY OF THE TASK FORCE -- IT'S A FOUNDATIONAL ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE INFANTS AND PERRANCE ABILITY. TO BOND WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THAT'S SIMPLY TAKES TIME. AND WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS MAKING SURE THAT LOWER INCOME. WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO BOND. AS UPPER INCOME CHILDREN. AND LET LET ME JUST INDICATE AT A COUPLE OF STATISTICS THAT SHOW ITS IMPORTANCE. FOR LOWER INCOME THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE FADE HAMLEY LEAVE THE UTILIZATION RATE IS 24%. UP 232%. IT'S THIRTY THIRTY TWO THOUSAND RATHER IT'S 3000030% UTILIZATION. SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT'S 41% UTILIZATION FOR THOSE EARNING OVER SIXTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S A 78% UTILIZATION. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT LOWER INCOMEPEOPLE SIMPLY CANNOT TAKE THE REDUCTION IN INCOME WITH THE POVERTY LINE AT LEAST THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND HIGHER? IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO IN THE OTHER. URBAN URBAN COUNTIES. OR WHAT THAT TRANSLATES INTO IF LOWER INCOME PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO TAKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. AT THE SAME PERCENTAGE AS UPPER INCOME WOULD BE ANOTHER EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND FAMILIES A YEAR. WOULD BE ABLE TO UTILIZE IT. SO OVER FIVE OR SIX YEARS WERE TALKING ABOUT. A HALF A MILLION FAMILIES BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE PAID FAMILY LEAVE SO THIS IS SIMPLE. THIS IS SOLELY ABOUT LOWER INCOME PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO BOND WITH THEIR CHILDREN THE INFANTS HAVING THOSE BENEFITS. TO THE SAME EXTENT. AS WEALTHIER FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU MISTER CALL US. PLEASE GO AHEAD BECAUSE IF YOU THAT I MEAN IT'S NOT TO KNOW WHAT CHILDREN NOW. A CHILDREN'S EARLIEST BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IS THE FOUNDATION OF THEIR LIFELONG HEALTH AND SUCCESS. THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF LIFE RABIES BRAINS. FOR MORE THAN ONE MILLION NEURAL CONNECTIONS RESEARCH ALSO MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS FEEL THIS EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. POVERTY AND ON MATT BASIC NEEDS. I MEAN FAMILIES CAN WEAKEN DEVELOPING BRAIN ARCHITECTURE BUT STABLE NURTURING RELATIONSHIPS AND PARENT CHILD INTERACTION CAN BUFFER THE IMPACTS. OF ADVERSITY AND FOSTER RESILIENCY. TING A VERY YOUNG CHILD PLACES ENORMOUS PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL DEMANDS ON ADULTS -- ESPECIALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA MANY CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CAN STAND IN THE WAY OF CHILDREN GOING UP HEALTHY. OUR CHILDREN NOW WITH PRESIDENT TED LAMBERT WAS PART OF THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE AND WITH A MEMBER OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD SUBCOMMITTEE WHICH RECOMMENDED. INCREASING THE WAGE REPLACEMENT THE GOAL OF INCREASING UTILIZATION OF PAID LEAVE POLICIES. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES ALMOST A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS CLAIM THEY DID NOT MAKE USE OF THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. DUE TO THE LIMITED WAGE REPLACEMENT THIS IS A DISPROPORTIONATE CONCERN. FOR WOMEN OF COLOR WORKING LOW WAGE JOBS WHO COULD NOT POPPED OUT OF PAID WORK WHEN THEY'RE FACING THE PRESSURES OF BEING THE FAMILY SOLE PROVIDER. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT WILL BETTER ENABLE ALL WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO MEET THEIR HEALTH AND FAMILY NEEDS WITHOUT SACRIFICING THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY. THANK YOU GO AHEAD SIR MY NAME IS CURTIS CHAN I'VE BEEN A MEDICAL DOCTOR IN CALIFORNIA FOR ABOUT THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. FOR SERVING AS A PEDIATRICIAN AT UC SAN FRANCISCO AND CURRENTLY AS DEPUTY HEALTH OFFICER FOR THE FOR THE SUBSTANCE COULD DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I'M HERE TO DESCRIBE WHY THIS IS A BILL THAT'S A PRIORITY FOR MANY HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND MEDICAL OR ORGANIZATIONS. AND CHILDREN'S ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- IT'S BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANT CHILD DEVELOPMENT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ON BABIES AND CHILDREN. THAT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE LIFE COURSE AND NUMBER TWO IT HAS A TREMENDOUS OF IMPACT ON MATERNAL STRESS. TOXIC STRESS AND MATERNAL DEPRESSION AFFECTING MOTHERS AT THE MOST CRITICAL STAGE OF LIFE. SO I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS AND THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE. AND I JUST WANT TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING IN OUR CLINICS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IT'S A SIMPLE SCENARIO. OF A MOM COMES INTO OUR CLINIC AND SHE MAKES TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. SHE'S FIRST TIME MOM. AND NOW SHE HAS A LOT MORE BILLS TO PAY [inaudible] A CRIB [inaudible] DIAPERS. POTENTIALLY BABY FORMULA FOOD SAVING UP FOR CHILDCARE BABY EQUIPMENT SHE MAKES TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SHE'S GOING TO TAKE MATERNITY LEAVE IF HER PAY IS CUT. TO FOURTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT'S THE DECISION THAT'S IN FRONT OF US AS A STATE. AND IT'S REALLY A DECISION FOR US AS A STATE AS LEGISLATORS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS EMPLOYERS AND ELECT AND PEOPLE AND AND AND RESIDENTS WERE VOTING. ARE WE A STATE THAT WANTS TO PROVIDE A BASIC OPPORTUNITY FOR BABIES. TO BOND WITH THEIR PARENTS FOR THE FIRST SIX TO TWELVE WEEKS OF THEIR LIFE. ARE WE GOING TO ENSURE THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS ARE WE GOING. TO BE A STATE THE INSURERS A BASIC RIGHT FOR BASIC BRAIN DEVELOPMENT EARLY CHILDHOOD BAY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. IN THE FIRST SIX TO TWELVE WEEKS OF LIFE OR ARE WE GOING TO BE A STATE. THAT BASIC FINANCIALLY ALLOWS BABIES TO BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THE VERB VERY FIRST FEW WEEKS OF LIFE. THAT'S THE BASIC QUESTION ARE WE ENOUGH OF A STATE DO WE HAVE ENOUGH WEALTH IN OUR STATE TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO FOR THAT SO THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT RIGHTS. FOR US AS PEDIATRICIANS THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SIR. OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR OR FOR THE WITNESSES. IF NOT -- MISS GONZALEZ YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO SUMMARIZE -- I DIDN'T SEE ALL THOSE -- I SHOULD WOULD USE MY GLASSES MORE OFF. OF ANY PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR THE BILL PLEASE GO. FOR COME FOR WITH. KEVIN ANTS GO FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION OF CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. KATHERINE -- GONE ON BEHALF OF FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. HI SUE BRING HIM WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSET BUILDING COALITION AND ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN CENTER LONG POVERTY ONS IN SUPPORT. TAYLOR JACK SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING A HUNDRED THOUSAND UNION NURSES STATEWIDE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT NOW SOME WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES A STRONG SUPPORT. JACQUELINE N. S. WITH A. R. P. IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MY GONNA GONNA BE HALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS A CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL OF SHEET METAL WORKERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. WHICH DUGGAR WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE HAVE A SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL WHILE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE OUTCOME IN THE GOALS AND EXPANDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE WE JUST. HOPE THAT IT LEADS TO A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE FUND PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO INCLUDE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. THERE ARE NONE SO THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO SUMMARIZE MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER THANK YOU -- I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS INTRODUCED. MEASURES THAT. WE CAN ALL SUPPORT TO EXTEND THE TIME PERIOD THAT PEOPLE CAN STAY HOME IT STARTED SIX MONTHS AND I THINK THEY'RE GONNA SETTLE ON EXTENDED BY TWO WEEKS. BUT THOSE DISPARITIES OF WHO CAN ACTUALLY STAY HOME. DON'T GET FIXED FROM THAT SO EIGHT WEEKS -- IF WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EIGHT WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE NOW WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE A VAST MAJORITY OF OF LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO CAN'T TAKE ANY TIME OFF. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING BY JUST SUPPORTING THAT FEATURE IS IS MAKING THE DISPARITY EVEN WORSE. AND SO MY CONCERN IS AS WE TALK ABOUT LEAVE -- PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN PARTICULAR THAT WE DO INSURE THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING PEOPLE BEHIND AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS BILL SEEKS TO CORRECT THAT SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY GOOD. THANK YOU FOR THAT EXCELLENT SUMMARY OF THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS THIS BILL ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER CALDERON. LOVE THE BILL LOVE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK AT THE ONLY QUESTION I ASK IS I I I I'M NOT QUITE A WHERE YOU CAN IF YOU COULD JUST ANSWER THIS REALLY QUICK OF IN TERMS OF MAYBE THEY'RE BEING UP. IN INCOME CAP OF THERE'S NOT ALREADY IN CONCERT THERE IS A AND IT'S IT IS UP. TO SIXTY TWO THOUSAND BASE OKAY DOLLARS SO. MY WIFE IS ON LEAVE RIGHT NOW SHE'S UNDER THAT. BUT EVEN SO BECAUSE MY INCOME WE ARE ABLE TO IT'S FINE LIKE IF IF SHE HAD FULL IT WOULD BE NICE BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY NECESSARY SO JUST TO KEEP THAT IN THE BACK YOUR MIND. THAT WOULD THAT WAY WE BECAUSE WE WANT THE BENEFITS TO GO TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AT THE LOWER END BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT ON THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T MAKE AS MUCH MONEY. WHERE PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF I WILL NECESSARY ALTHOUGH WOULD BE NICE IT DOESN'T WE DON'T NECESSARILY NEED HER TO BE A 100%? RIGHT WELL BUT IF I AND I WOULD JUST CHALLENGE A LITTLE BIT -- IF SHE WERE SINGLE MOM THOUGH IT AND AT THAT LEVELSHE MIGHT NEED A 100% AND I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW I'M. OBVIOUSLY IF WE IF THIS IN BUDGET WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHERE WE CAN LAND ON THIS TO MAKE IT AS WORTHWHILE -- BUT AS MAYBE CONSIDER IF THAT'S A DIFF THAT THE DUKE AND COME HOUSEHOLDS IN LIKE THAT ANY OF THAT BUT RIGHT NOW WEEK WE START THIS DISCUSSION AT A 100%. SO THAT WE COULD -- JUST SHOWCASE THE DISPARITY IN A AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE ON THE LOWEST WAGE WORKERS FIRST -- PHASE IT IN UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW I THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS DECIDED HE IS GOING TO DO THE DIGITAL TWO WEEKS AND NOT TAKE ON THIS ISSUE AND SO I THINK IT'S A POINT THAT THIS -- LEGISLATURE STATE THEIR OPINION ON THIS FEATURE OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE. BRIDGET THAT MOVE THE BILL. GOOD ACTORS RISEN MOTION AND SECOND TO APPROVE THIS BILL ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

AND THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER FOR ACCEPTING THEM MA'AM THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY AND I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT -- OTHER STATES IN FACT PROVIDE POOR ODD LOCKED OUT AND STRIKING WORKERS TO ACCESS UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THIS WOULD ALLOW -- LOCKED OUT WORKERS OF COURSE AT NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEM AT THE REGULAR TIME OF ANY UNEMPLOYED PERSON AND WOULD ALLOW STRIKING WORKERS AFTER -- BEING IN A LABOR DISPUTE OF LONGER THAN -- WHAT FOUR WEEKS BECAUSE AT THE THE NORMAL ONE WEEK BUT AN ADDITIONAL THREE WEEKS I'M TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS STRIKING AT THE THE DECISION TO TO GO ON STRIKE IS NEVER AN EASY -- ONE A IT IS SELDOM THAT STRIKES LAST THAT LONG IT IS THE ONLY IN THE MOST EXTREME CASES AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF SO MANY FEDERAL INTERFERENCE IS -- OUR LABOR LAWS ARE OUT OF BALANCE IN THIS WILL HELP -- AT LEAST KEEP -- STRIKING WORKERS FROM GOING HUNGRY SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE [inaudible] THIS IS. GO AHEAD SIR. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN DALY -- AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS TOM RUNYON VICE PRESIDENT COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT NINE WHICH COVERS CALIFORNIAN ABOUT AND WHY -- WE ARE CO SPONSORING AB TEN SIXTY SIX UNDER CURRENT LAW EMPLOYEES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IF THEY LEFT WORK TO A DUE TO A TRADE DISPUTE. AB TEN SIXTY SIX WOULD RESTORE ELIGIBILITY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AFTER THREE WEEKS HAVE PASSED. THIS IS SIMILAR TO A BILL ADOPTED RECENTLY IN NEW JERSEY. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS COVER ONLY A FRACTION OF A WORKER'S PAYCHECK. AB TEN SIXTY SIX WILL HELP DETER LARGE EMPLOYERS FROM USING UNREASONABLE NEGOTIATING TACTICS SIMPLY TO DRIVE WORKERS TO FINANCIAL RUIN. AB -- TEN SIXTY SIX ONLY. COVERS A MODEST PAYMENT BUT NONE THE LESS WOULD HELP WORKERS MAKE ENDS MEET IF BARGAINING IS PROLONGED. THE BILL WILL CREEP EIGHT A MORE LEVEL FIELD BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES OUR MEMBERS HAVE WORK FOR THESE CORPORATIONS FOR YEARS AND DESERVE ACCESS TO THOSE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THIS BILL IS EXCUSE ME CRUCIAL TO MAKING SURE WE ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND BOTH SIDES. ARE. ABLE TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH. I WANT. TO TAKE THE TIME TO THANK ASSEMBLY WOMAN LORENA GONZALEZ FOR SUPPORTING AND SPONSORING AB TEN SIXTY SIX I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION TODAY. AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU SIR. GO AHEAD MITCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL -- ALONG WITH C. TO BE WAY THE UFCW MAINLY TO WE BELIEVE BETTER ALIGN OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM WITH ITS TWIN INTENDED PURPOSES OF BOTH HELPING WORKERS SURVIVE THE HARDSHIPS OF UNEMPLOYMENT BUT ALSO HELPING THEIR SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL ECONOMIES DO THE SAME. THAT WHEN A GROUP OF WORKERS GOES OUT ON STRIKE AND THEY'RE LEFT WITH NOTHING. THEY CAN NO LONGER BUY GROCERIES THEY CAN NO LONGER PAY THEIR MORTGAGES AND THE NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THAT CAN SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT WE DO HAVE AN UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM IS TO HELP. MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THINGS LIKE THAT. AND JUST TO OUR QUICKLY RESPOND TO A FEW -- OPPONENT CONCERNS AS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN STATED THERE ARE A LOT OF BUILT IN DISINCENTIVES THAT DISCOURAGE WORKERS FROM STRIKING. AND TO IMPLY THAT GIVING THEM UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS ESPECIALLY AFTER A MONTH WE WOULD ARGUE PRETTY SEVERELY MISUNDERSTANDS WHAT GOING ON STRIKE IS ACTUALLY LIKE -- FOR ONE THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM ONLY REPLACES WAGES AT AN AVERAGE OF 26%. SO WHEN YOU GO OUT ON STRIKE YOU'RE COLLECTING ON AVERAGE ABOUT A QUARTER OF WHAT YOU WERE EARNING SO WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE MONTH LONG WAIT -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MOST OF US WOULD REALLY STRUGGLE TO DO AND SO WE THINK THAT ALONE -- WILL ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS WILL ONLY STRIKE AS THEY DO NOW WHEN IT'S THE ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT. AND BEING ON STRIKE IS A GRUELING HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT SITTING AT HOME WITH YOUR FEET ON THE COFFEE TABLE WITH SOME. YOU'RE OUT PICKETING YOU'RE OUT ORGANIZING USUALLY MUCH HARDER THAN YOUR ACTUAL JOB AND SO THAT. COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT IT CREATES A LOT OF BAD BLOOD IN THE WORKPLACE IT'S NEVER REALLY THE SAME AFTER THAT THIS IS SOMETHING NO ONE WANTS TO DO. AND THAT'S WHY I WAS ALSO MENTION STRIKES ARE SO RARE. ONE FEDERAL AGENCY THAT TRACKS VERY LARGE STRIKES OF AFFECTING OVER A THOUSAND WORKERS FOUND THAT THERE WERE ONLY THREE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. ANOTHER ONE THAT STRUCK THE TRACKS SMALLER STRIKES FOUND THAT FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEPENDING ON HOW YOU COUNT THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN TO TEN STRIKES THAT WOULD BE A FACTORED BY THIS BILL. ONLY AFFECTING A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE WORKERS. TINY TINY FRACTION OF THE OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYTEM SO WE THINK THE AFFECTS THAT WOULD BE PRETTY MINIMAL. AND JUST FINALLY -- THE OPPONENTS ALSO REFERENCE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA UFCW STRIKE THAT WE THINK IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. FOR ONE THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKERS AFFECTED WERE LOCKED OUT. SO WHETHER THEY WANTED TO WORK OR NOT THE EMPLOYER WASN'T GONNA LET THEM BUT BECAUSE OF SOME QUIRKS AND ARE YOU WHY SYSTEM THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO COLLECT BENEFITS. AND SO THE BILL FIXES THAT AND ALSO FOR THE WORKERS WHO DID GO OUT ON STRIKE THE EMPLOYER LONG STORY SHORT BASICALLY WANTED TO GET RID OF THEIR ENTIRE HEALTH PLAN AND THEIR PENSION PLAN. SO THESE ARE WORKERS WHO WERE REALLY BACKED INTO A CORNER WHERE THEY WERE FACED WITH THE LOSS OF HEALTH CARE AND THE LOSS OF RETIREMENT SECURITY. AND SO THEY ALSO WERE DENIED YOU AYE BENEFITS AND THAT'S WE THINK YOU KNOW REALLY THE KIND OF SITUATION WHERE WORKERS. HAVE NO OTHER OPTION THERE REALLY FORCED TO TAKE THIS NO MATTER WHAT THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE OF GOING ON A STRIKE MIGHT BE. THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE KINDS WORKERS THAT WE THINK ARE OUT THERE THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL BUT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LOSE EVERYTHING AS A RESULT OF TRYING TO DEFEND WHAT THEY'VE GOT WE ARE TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER SEMEN. OF OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF UNITE HERE THE TEAMSTERS THE IN THE BOATMAN'S UNION -- THE MACHINISTS AND OTHERS ALL IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU.

ANY PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL I SEE A COUPLE. HEARTY SOULS HERE [inaudible] THE WELL WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE GO AHEAD -- GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS COMMITTEE ROBERT MUTRIE -- FOR THE CAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- AND WE ARE OPPOSED AB -- TEN SIXTY SIX FIRST AYE I WANT -- TO BRING OUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE WHAT OUR OFFICE IS NOT BASED ON OUR VISION IS NOT BASED ON THE IDEA PROVIDING -- BENEFITS GENERALLY TO INDIVIDUALS ON STRIKE. IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY ARE. SHORT ON ON FOOD YOU KNOW THESE DESPERATE SITUATIONS TALKED ABOUT IF THE STATE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE BENEFITS IN MID IN MANY WAYS THE STATE DOES AND CAN. THE ISSUE OF ON OUR AND IS THIS CHANGES THE BASICALLY THE PURPOSE OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM WHICH UNTIL NOW WAS SET UP AS A BALANCED INCENTIVE INCENTIVIZING EMPLOYERS. TO ENSURE STABILITY IN THE WORKPLACE BY NOT TERMINATING EMPLOYEES WITHOUT REASON AND AND KEEP IN PLACE ON AND SERVE AS EMPLOYEES TO IF THEY ARE TERMINATE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. TO HELP THEM TRANSITION THAT WAS THAT THE BALANCE OF INCENTIVE SET UP IN THAT BALANCE IS REFLECTED IN THE FUNDING SYSTEM FOR YOU WHY -- YOU KNOW IT. AS I'M SURE THE COMMITTEES WHERE YOU AYE IS FUNDED INTO TEARS THE FIRST YEAR FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYERS CONDUCT AN EXPERIENCE RATING IN THE SECOND HERE FOLKS ON THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE FUND -- AND TAKING THOSE ONE BY. ONE I'M FIRST LOOKING TO THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER -- IN THESE SITUATIONS LET'S SAY THAT. AS A LABOR DISPUTE PROGRESSES AND AGAIN WE WE ALSO HOPE THAT LABOR STREETS ARE NOT NEEDED. IDEALLY ALL OF THESE CAN YOURSELF EARLIER YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY -- BUT IN THE EVENT A LABOR DISPUTE DOES PROCEED AND WE REACH A POINT WHERE THIS BILLS NOW A FOUR WEEK THRESHOLD -- KICKS IN -- WE'RE LOOKING AT AN EMPLOYER THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER INVOLVED FACING INCREASE THEIR EXPERIENCING RATING FOR LET'S SAY YOU KNOW A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE SIZE THE UNION BUT X.. INCREASE BASED NUMBER EMPLOYEES INVOLVED -- AND THAT SIGNIFICANT THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER GOING FORWARD FOR SOME TIME BUT EVEN STEPPING BACK TO THE BROADER QUESTION ABOUT THE FUNDS OVERALL HEALTH. I'M INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYERS YOU KNOW THE FACE THAT AND EVEN IF WE ASSUME MOMENTARILY INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYERS ARE CAUSING ISSUES. THE ENTIRE FUNDS SUSTAINABILITY IS AN ISSUE HERE AS AS YOU ALL ARE AWARE RECENTLY THE FUN WAS DEEPLY IN DEBT. AND THE STABILITY THE FUN COMING OUT OF THIS BILL IS A CONCERN ON OUR END. FRIEDMAN EMPLOYERS WHO DO NOT HAVE STRIKES AND DO NOT -- TURN ON ALL OF THESE SITUATIONS SO BECAUSE OF THE SOURCE OF THESE AND AND PULLING UNEMPLOYMENT BY THE WAY INTO AN AREA WHERE. TRADITIONALLY IT IS IS NOT WAY IN LABOR DISPUTES IT'S NOT INTENDED THAT WAY IN FACT THERE IT AS LAW THAT. EDT IN INVESTIGATIONS EVEN IF THE FACT THE TERM IN THAT. WHICH WAY THE DISPUTE WAS BECAUSE IT'S NOT SUPPOSED INFLUENCE BENEFITS SO -- BY POLITICIZING YOU AYE AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE COST ADDITIONS TO NOT JUST EMPLOYERS INVOLVED IN STRIKES INTENSELY ALL EMPLOYERS A WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED. THANK YOU SIR MS RICE GO AHEAD THANK YOU. NICOLE RISE CALIFORNIA MANY FACTORS IN TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO THE BILL FOR THE REASONS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY STATED -- JUST WANT TO ADD ALSO RELATED TO THE HEALTH OF THE FUNDS SO -- EMPLOYERS JUST TO ENCOURAGE A TEN BILLION DOLLAR. PAYMENTS TO FOR THE U. I FIND WHEN WE WERE IN THE RECESSION AND THE FUN WENT INSOLVENT AND WE HAD TO PAY THAT BACK BECAUSE OF THE LOAN THAT WE TOOK OUT FROM THE FAT. THAT WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT WE ARE BUT OUR CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILL IS NOW A POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS THAT IS OUTSIDE OF THE REACH CURRENTLY OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE NOT PERMANENTLY SEPARATED FROM THEIR EMPLOYMENT THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN WILL NOW HAVE ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES AND THE QUESTION THAT WE ASK THE COMMITTEE IS TO CONSIDER HOW THAT WILL IMPACT? THE THE SOLVENCY IN THE HEALTH OF THE FIND PARTICULARLY SENSE WE ARE HEARING MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY ABOUT. BEING CLOSER AND CLOSER OR EXTENDED OVER FROM WHERE A RECESSION WOULD HEAD SO WE THINK THAT THOSE CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL AS THE ONES THAT WERE MENTIONED ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE RATING AND HOW THAT WILL IMPACT OUR EXPERIENCE YOU RATING AS EMPLOYERS. AND THE FULL NATURE OF THE FIND OUR REASONS -- FOR OUR OPPOSITION AND WE ASK FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THAT AND TO YOU WE QUIT AND WE REQUEST A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS RICE -- ARE THERE OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. IF NOT COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THE BILL. FOR ANY OF THE WITNESSES OR FOR THE AUTHOR. THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION IS A SUPPORT POSITION -- IT'S A VERY THOUGHT PROVOKING SUBJECT AND I THINK IT'S BEEN HASHED OUT PRETTY THOROUGHLY -- OUR OF OUR COMMITTEE STAFF DID A GREAT JOB ANALYZING IT AND THERE ARE SOME UNKNOWNS GOING FORWARD BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT THE EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY IS -- THE FUND IS HAD TO SOME TO SOME TOUGH TIMES AND IT'S SO IT'S SOLVENT NOW AND IT'S IN BETTER SHAPE THAN IT'S BEEN IN MANY YEARS THE RATES HAVE COME DOWN. OF IN SOME CASES SO WE'LL SEE WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS. BUT I THINK -- THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO LIKE IN EMBRACE ABOUT THIS BILL IN AGAIN -- I'M RECOMMENDING SUPPORT POSITION IS OUR MOTION AND SECOND. THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND SECOND MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER ANY CLOSING COMMENTS THANK YOU I WOULD JUST SUGGEST -- IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE HOW WE VIEW DE POLITICIZING SOMETHING I GUESS COMES FROM THE POINT OF OF OF YOUR ACTION I THINK THIS ACTUALLY DE POLITICIZE IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND. BECAUSE WHEN SOMEBODY IS OUT OF WORK -- OFF AND AND AND I THINK IT WAS STATED AT NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN THEY STILL NEED TO PAY THE BILLS AND OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY SUFFERS WHEN -- WORKERS HAVE TO TAKE THE VERY EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF GOING ON STRIKE AND LET'S BE HONEST FOR OVER FOUR WEEKS. HAVING -- WALKED PICKET LINES WITH WORKERS WHO WHO WERE STUCK IN THAT POSITION I CAN I CAN TELL YOU THE PERSONAL HARDSHIP THAT THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE TO SUSTAIN AND IT'S ALWAYS. A A IF THE STRIKE GOES ON THAT THAT LONG IT IS ALWAYS BECAUSE THEY ARE STRIKING FOR THEIR VERY LIVELIHOOD -- AND I THINK THAT THE PRESSURE ON EMPLOYERS TO SETTLE DISPUTES WILL GROW -- AND THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S ALWAYS THE PRESSURE THE INDIVIDUALIZED PRESSURE ON THE WORKER TO GIVE IN IN A DISPUTE AND I THINK AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY ALL THESE BUSINESSES WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE EMPLOYMENT -- INSURANCE FUND WOULD BE WOULD ALSO THEN UP AT IT BE ABLE TO HAVE HONEST DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EMPLOYER AS WELL I THINK THAT THAT ADDS TO MORE BALANCE IN IN THE PROVISION. I WILL ALSO STATE THAT -- WE HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THIS BILL FOR IT SINCE I WAS ELECTED HONESTLY -- AND THAT IS BECAUSE IN OUR TALKS WITH THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE NET DE WE REALIZE THAT THE FUND WAS IN A BAD POSITION BUT WE ARE NO LONGER IN A BAD POSITION AND SO -- WE HAVE WAITED UNTIL WE ARE IN A POSITION OF OF HEALTH AND STRENGTH WITH OUR FIND IN ORDER TO MOVE THIS BOARD AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. ALRIGHT SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND VOTE THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND. ON A. B. TEN SIXTY SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. DALY AYE DALY AYE MAYES BERMAN. BERMAN AYE BIGELOW.

MR CHOOSE BILL IS. AB [inaudible] ELEVEN OH SEVEN ITEM. SEVEN COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE CHEERING AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED TO SPEAK YET. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TIME ALSO WITH HIM FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER VEAS. HOPING THAT. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT BECAUSE SHE ALSO WANTED. TO SOME COMMON. BUT THIS WILL SERVE AS AN ONGOING DISCUSSION WAS THE STAKEHOLDERS ON WAYS TO ENSURE TIMELY PROCESSING OF WORKMAN'S COMPENSATION CLAIMS. I BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD DUE TO A CONCERN THAT MANY MEDICAL TREATMENTS ARE BEING DELAYED THROUGH TO WORKERS COMP AS COMPENSATION PROCESSES. I LIKE TO EXPLORE WAYS TO CREATE MORE EFFICIENCY WHEN ANGEL WORKERS CAN GET NECESSARY TREATMENT AND GET BACK TO WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IT IS A OF BENEFICIAL FOR THEM. THE EMPLOYEES AND THE FLORENCE. THE OF A COMPANIES THANK YOU. TODAY THEN I HAVE A STEP THAT THE COMEDIANS SUCH A SUGGESTION. THAT THE BILL WOULD BE NARAL AND THAT IS -- WOULD BE A VEHICLE FOR THE STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSION ON THE DELIVERY MEDICAL CARE TO INJURE WORKERS IN A MORE EFFICIENT MANNER. I'M COMMITTED TO BRINGING THIS BILL BACK TO TO COME MEDIA AFTER DEATH STAKEHOLDERS PROCESSES. HAVE OCCURRED AT A WALL SO WANT TO THING ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIAS BE COME IN. AND JOIN US TO ADD A COMMENT GOOD. THANK YOU MISTER CHIU. GO AHEAD MS REYES TURN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL. I AM A CO AUTHOR OF AB ELEVEN OH SEVEN AND FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT TO THE ISSUES RAISED BY THIS LEGISLATION. AS SOMEONE WHO IS PRACTICED IN WORKERS COMPENSATION FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE COMING TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AS THE ANALYSIS MENTIONS. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO FACILITATE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO REVEAL WHAT APPROACHES WHAT APPROACHES WE CAN TAKE. TO IMPROVE MEDICAL CARE AND THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM. AS SOMEONE WHO SPENT HER CAREER REPRESENTING INJURED WORKERS I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN SPITE OF THE BEST EFFORTS OF OUR FORMER GOVERNOR AND MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE. THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN PLACE NOW CREATES AN ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES INVOLVED. EVEN WHEN THEY MAY AGREE ON A COURSE OF TREATMENT. WHILE THE EXISTING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO SAVE MONEY FOR BUSINESSES TO BETTER RATES AND REDUCE COST I WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE TIMELY TREATMENT. WE HAVE SEEN THE LADIES IN PROVIDING MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR VERIFIED AND DIAGNOSED WORK RELATED INJURIES. CALIFORNIA IS NEAR THE BOTTOM AND TIMELY TREATMENT COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. AND COSTS TO EMPLOYERS REMAINS HIGH. THESE DELAYS HURT BOTH EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS. BUT WHENEVER THE IDEAS DISCUSSED TO REFORM UTILIZATION REVIEW AT INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESSES. WE FIND THAT REASONABLE DISCUSSIONS ARE PUSHED ASIDE. BY THE FALSE IDEA THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS. AND IS SO SACROSANCT THAT THE THOUGHT OF CHANGING IT IS POLITICAL HERESY. TODAY I OFFER TO YOU THAT WE DO NOT HAVE TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. WITHIN THE CONFINES OF PREVIOUS CONFLICTS. IT'S OKAY TO ADMIT THAT WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM THEY WILL GET WORKERS THE TREATMENT THEY NEED WITHOUT DELAY. AT THE SAME TIME KEEP COSTS DOWN FOR BUSINESSES. I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MISSED REYES AND YOU HAVE SOME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT HERE. THANK YOU -- GOOD MORNING THANK YOU CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY I'M DIANE WORLEY POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. I WANT TO ALSO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CHIU ANDREAS FOR INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE AND THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR YOUR ONGOING WORK ON THIS ISSUE. WHILE THE WORKERS COMPENSATION REFORM BILLS ENACTED BY GOVERNOR BROWN HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS FOR WORKERS AND LOWER INSURANCE COSTS TO EMPLOYERS THEY HAVE ALSO GENERATED RECORD PROFITS FOR INSURANCE CARRIERS. HOWEVER THE COST OF THESE REFORMS HAVE BEEN UNACCEPTABLE TREATMENT DELAYS FOR INJURED WORKERS. A NATIONAL STUDY FROM THE WORKERS COMPENSATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE RELEASED LAST YEAR. COMPARED DELAYS AND AUTHORIZATION FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT ON WORKERS INJURY CLAIMS IN EIGHTEEN STATES IN THIS STUDY CALIFORNIA CAME IN DEAD LAST. FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE INITIAL MEDICAL BILLS THAT. THIS STUDY CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THAT CALIFORNIA'S INJURED WORKERS FACE LONG DELAYS IN RECEIVING TREATMENT. COSTING EMPLOYERS AND LOST TIME AND COSTING EMPLOYEE EMPLOYEES IN LOST EARNINGS. CALL RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON AB ELEVEN OH SEVEN AS THE BEGINNING OF THE DISCUSSION NOT THE END TO FIND A WAY THAT GREATER EFFICIENCY. MIGHT BE BUILT INTO THE MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESS AND REDUCE THESE UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS. WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT THANK THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTIE BELL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIRES FIREFIGHTERS ALSO PLEASED TO BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I CAN SAY AS A PERSON WHO SAT AT THE TABLE DURING THE LAST. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT REFORMING THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM I THINK OUR AUTHOR AND CO AUTHOR SAID IT PERFECTLY -- THAT WAS AN EFFORT AND IT IS NOW YIELDED MORE ISSUES FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO DEAL WITH MY MEMBERS ARE NOT SATISFIED MY MEMBERS ARE AWFUL WORK MUCH LONGER THEY INTEND TO BE. BECAUSE THEY'RE WAITING WELL THIS ADVERSARIAL IN FRICTIONAL SYSTEM DEBATES OVER WHETHER THE TREATMENT THEIR PHYSICIAN RECOMMENDS IS ACTUALLY. GOING TO BE DELIVERED IN THE MEANTIME IT'S COSTING EVERYONE MONEY AND IT'S COSTING US IT'S IT'S PUTTING IN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON MY MEMBERS WHO JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO WORK. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE AT HOME. SO THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR -- FOR MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD TODAY AND FOR TO OUR AUTHORS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO MY MEMBERS. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EXCUSE ME I'VE LEARNED JUDGES SO I KEEP UNEVEN OFF MY VOICE PROJECTS VERY WELL TODAY. IT WILL HIT WHAT CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU GO GO HEAD -- SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL MISTER CHAIRMAN SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. EFFORT WORRY FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU ANY OTHER PERSONS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IF NOT OTHER PERSONS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL [inaudible] AND WELCOME GO AHEAD. HI GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME FLOOR CURTIS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING WE DO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES -- AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL I THEY DID A GREAT DEAL WITH THEM REMEDIATING SOME OF OUR PROBLEMS HOWEVER WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO FULLY ANALYZE THE FULL SCOPE OF WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE CURRENT LANGUAGE WOULD DO. OUR CONCERN AT FIRST GLANCE IS THAT IT POTENTIALLY PUTS THE OPINIONS OF THE COURT ABOVE THE OPINIONS OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO ANALYZE. THE I AM OUR PROCESS AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE STILL OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS STATE FOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IS. WE ALSOAPPRECIATE THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT REMOVE VERY TROUBLING LANGUAGE AND ARE STILL REVIEWING THE RECENTLY AMENDED. TAX TO THE BELL BUT WE DO HAVE SOME INITIAL CONCERNS AND JUST WANTED TO I BRING FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION IF YOU POINTS ON INDEPENDENT MEDICAL RUBIO. THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION INSTITUTE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT NINE OUT OF TEN YOU ARE DENIALS ARE UPHELD. AND IT'S THE TOP 1% OF DOCTORS THAT ACCOUNT FOR FORTY FOUR POINT 2% OF DISPUTED SERVICES WE ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT 95% OF LETTERS THAT REQUEST I ADMIRE IN RESPONSE TO INJURED WORKERS REPRESENTATIVES ALMOST ALL OF THEM ATTORNEYS. AND THAT'S WHAT REQUIRES CLAIMS ADMINISTRATOR STAFF TO SPEND TIME CONTINUALLY RESPONDING TO THOSE FILINGSRATHER THAN ON SPENDING THEIR TIME PROVIDING TIMELY AND ACCURATE BENEFITS TO INJURED WORKERS WHICH IS OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE. THANK YOU. ARE THERE OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO OPPOSE THE BILL MARK SEVEN WITH THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALLY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION AMERICA ALSO POST. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRIS MAKAYLA ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CLAIMS PROFESSIONALS ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THE CALL RISE CALVARY MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POST. SHERMAN MEMBERS JOHN NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF ZENITH INSURANCE COMPANY LIBERTY MUTUAL WE SURE OF THE CONCERNS ARE EXPRESSED HERE AS WELL ON THIS BLL THANK YOU. AND WILL CONTINUE TO OBSERVE. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY. QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. OR FOR THE CO AUTHOR. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER FRAZIER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS A FORMER EMPLOYER I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND AS AN EMPLOYEE THE PROCESS OF OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING. TO ACCOMPLISHMENT AGAIN THERE ARE -- EMPLOYEES ARE SENT TO DOCTORS TO REFUTE THE INJURIES -- AND IT AND AND IT DOES DELAY COMPENSATION IT STOPS COMPENSATION AT SOME POINTS IN TIME. AND I DO LIKE THE THE PROCESS OF OF THE 25% OR TEN THOUSAND WHICHEVER WHICHEVER IS LESS. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A DETERRENT IN PLACE. BUT IT'S TALK ABOUT HAVING A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE GOING FORWARD THIS BILL ISN'T A PANACEA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AS FAR AS TALKING TO THE OPPOSITION. ABOUT FINDING A BALANCE BECAUSE NOT ALL NOT ALL. CARRIERS DO THIS AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE IDENTIFYING SOME THAT DO. IT'S NOT ACROSS THE BOARD -- TYPICALLY. SO HOW DO WE GET TO YES ON A BALANCE. THAT BOTH OF BOTH OF THE OPPOSITION AND SUPPORT CAN COME TO A CONCLUSION THAT YES OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THIS HAS BEEN. A PROBLEMATIC [inaudible] BUT WE WANT. SOME KIND OF POLICY IN PLACE THAT SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT WE WANT WE WANT TO PREVENT FRAUD. AND MAKE SURE THAT PREMIUMS CAN STAY LOWER YOU KNOW AT A AT A RATE BUT ALSO -- SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING I MEAN WHERE YOU AT THE LIST OF THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YOU KNOW AND AT ALL WITH YOUR CHALLENGE TO TO REACH THAT BALANCE -- A BALANCE MEANS AND AND NEITHER SIDE IS HAPPY. AND I'M I'M. COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT AND I WILL COME ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THE OPPOSITION OF AS WELL AND TO TO JOIN THE DISCUSSION AND I WOULD DEFINITELY. WOULD INCLUDE YOU TO OF A JUST JOIN THE DISCUSSION WILL -- WERE IT IT IT IT IS -- UP HILL BATTLE BUT YOU KNOW WE'LL BE WORKING ON IT I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER REASSESS WILL BE WORKING ON THIS FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND IF THAT'S NOT A USED TO WORK BUT WORLD. I FIGURES WERE TRYING. I THINK IF I MAY OUT ALSO THE BRINGING THE EMPLOYERS TO THE TABLE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BENEFITED FROM THIS REFORM EITHER. THEIR RATES ARE STILL HIGH ADD TO TREATMENT IS STILL BEING DENIED AND STILL BEING DELAYED AND THAT WE KNOW THAT TO ONCE UTILIZATION REVIEW DENIES THE BENEFIT. AT THE I AM ALL I AM ARE -- LEVEL JUST AS WAS NOTED EARLIER IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS TONIGHT. SO IF YOU HAVE A TREATING DOCTORS SAYING THIS TREATMENT IS NECESSARY. AND YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S NEVER EXAMINED THAT EMPLOYEE NOW COMING AND SAYING WE'VE REVIEWED THE RECORDS NEVER TOUCH THAT EMPLOYEE NEVER SPOKEN WITH EMPLOYEE WITH THAT TREATMENT IS NOT NECESSARY. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT DISCONNECT WHEN YOU HAVE AN I AM OUR DOCTOR ABSOLUTELY DENYING A BENEFIT AFTER REVIEW. AND THAT THE IDENTITY OF THE I AM OUR DOCTOR WILL NEVER BE DISCLOSED UNDER LAW. THAT DOCTOR CAN NEVER BE DEPOSED UNDER LAW WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF IT AT THE DOCTOR EMPLOYER. EMPLOYEE LEVEL AND I THINK BRING IN THE EMPLOYERS TO THE TABLE pIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THIS IS TOO BIG AN ISSUE FOR ONE SIDE TO TO COME FORWARD WITH WITH. THE ONLY THE ONLY SOLUTION BUT THE SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE WE HAVE TOO MANY EMPLOYEES WITH LEGITIMATE ACCEPTED INJURIES WHERE THE DOCTORS ARE RECOMMENDING TREATMENT AND THE TREATMENT IS BEING DELAYED AND DELAYED WHEN YOU DELAY SOMETHING THAT LONG YOU ARE DENYING THE BENEFITS. YOU ALL HEARD ME LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE WHEN I HAD THE THE EMPLOYEES WERE FROM THE FROM THE TERRORIST ATTACK IN SANDRA DINO. WITH LEGITIMATE ACCEPTED THE INJURIES WHO HAD ASKED FOR TREATMENT DOCTORS TREATING DOCTOR SELECTED BY THE EMPLOYER HAD RECOMMENDED TREATMENT AND YET THE TREATMENT WAS DENIED. THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE SYSTEM WHEN THAT IS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN. EMPLOYERS NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE CARRIERS NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE IN THE THE INJURED WORKERS ALSO NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE. YEAH AND I'D LIKE TO IF YOU CAN SUPPLY TO ME THE DATA THAT SUBSTANTIATES. THAT HOW MANY TREATED WORKERS HAVE BEEN DENIED WITH THE THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE ON CLAIMS RIGHT SO WHAT'S WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE NUMBERS WHAT'S THE DATE AT THE DRIVE SINCE I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT OKAY. THE DATA IS AVAILABLE AND I WOULD I THINK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THIS ANALYSIS WERE IN YOUR PRESENTATION SAYING THAT YOU KNOW 25% WORKERS HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE I AM OUR PROCESS. OR WHATEVER THE SUBSTANTIATES THIS IS GOING FORWARD. I WAS EMPLOYED FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I NEVER HAD A WORKMAN'S COMP CLAIM BUT MY PREMIUMS WERE JUST. I REGISTER. SERIOUSLY WAS A BIG PART OF MY OVERHEAD -- AND THANK GOD I HAD IN CASE. SOMEBODY WAS HER ON THE PROJECT. OF THAT I WAS ON BUT YOU KNOW THE THE THE FOLKS LIKE. MIKE IN MY WORLD THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE CLAIMS ARE PAYING FOR THE FRAUD. AND AND I DO WANT. ALL OF THE FRAUD. BEING TAKEN CARE OF YOU KNOW POST HASTE -- BUT I REALLY WANT TO SEE A DIALOGUE WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE. SO SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE JUST LIKE YOU AND I'VE DONE WITH. IN THE PAST -- SOME REMEMBER THAT WE ACTUALLY GET GOOD DATA THAT DRIVES THIS AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT EVERY STAKEHOLDER CAN ACTUALLY HAVE -- THEIR POINT OF VIEW. ARE BROUGHT INTO THE SENATE AND AGAIN IT'S AN ANALYSIS YOU WANNA HAVE THAT THAT UPPER APORTES FEEDBACK GOING FOR NAY APPRECIATE THAT SO THE BOOK FOR TWO OF A GOOD DISCUSSION ALL RIGHT SO WITH THIS BILL THERE WILL BE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SHARING OF DATA AND FOR MANY. DISCUSSIONS AND AND IT'S A IT'S A BUT NINE BILL IN THE SENSE THAT IT ENCOURAGES CONVERSATIONS IN A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT WILL HAPPEN AND WILL AS MR CHIU TO KEEP US INFORMED AND MS RACES WELL KEEP US INFORMED OF THE PROGRESS OF THE CONVERSATIONS -- THERE WAS A BIG REFORM IN THE SYSTEM -- MY THINKING GOVERNOR BROWN'S FIRST YEAR OR SOMEWHERE IN HIS FIRST TERM AND SO WERE -- THERE'S LOTS OF DATA NOW AS TO THE BOTH THE GOOD AND THE BAD THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM THAT MAJOR REFORM. THIS BILL WILL A STIMULATE SOME VERY. HOPEFULLY SOME HELP HELPFUL CONVERSATIONS AND SHARING OF DATA. THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND ON THE BILL. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. LET'S VOTE. ON A. B.
