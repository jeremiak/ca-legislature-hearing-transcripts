THIS SUMMER WE ARE WITNESSING A RECKONING REGARDING THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION. SCHOOL DISTRICTS COMMUNITIES AND STATE LEGISLATURES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE VERY DIFFICULT AND OFTEN EMOTIONAL TOPIC THE CONCERNS HOW WE VIEW AND PORTRAY OURSELVES AS A NATION. BECAUSE OF THE PROTESTS AND OUTCRY THE pFOLLOWED THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD ONE YEAR AGO. WE ARE IN A MOMENT OF HISTORY NOT UNLIKE THAT OF NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE WHEN THE MURDER OF EMMETT TEEL.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE WILL NOW GO TO YOUR LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES BUFFER COMMITTEE- IF YOU WERE ON THE LINE PLEASE PROCEED YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES AND MR ALVIN LEE WILL ALSO HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEFLY SHARE A FEW COMMENTS WITH YOU. IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE OH ONE. I FOLLOW THE PATH OF THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION FOR MANY YEARS. AND I MUST SAY UP FRONT I AM A STRONG SUPPORTER OF AB ONE OH ONE BUT NOT FOR POLITICAL REASONS BUT FOR SOUND PEDAGOGICAL AND INTELLECTUAL REASONS. IN ADDITION AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR ME PERSONALLY BUT FRIDAY I KNOW FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS I SUPPORT THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION BECAUSE AS A CITIZEN WHO IS DEEPLY CONCERNED. ABOUT ETHNIC AND RACE RELATIONS IN OUR STATE AND NATION. I CONFIDENTLY BELIEVE THAT ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM COMPLAIN IMPORTANT POSITIVE ROLE IN HELPING OUR STUDENTS UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE DIVERSITY THAT DEFINES SO MUCH OF CALIFORNIA AND AMERICAN SOCIETY. I HAVE PREVIOUSLY ENDORSES LEGISLATION BEFORE THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE OF ASSEMBLY AND THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AS A CONSIDERED ADOPTING THE ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM. THREE THERE ARE MANY COMPELLING REASONS TO ENDORSE AB ONE OH ONE AND I MENTIONED THREE HERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DATA REFERENCE THIS BILL BUT ALL ALL GO OVER JUST VERY BRIEFLY THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES ON THE EFFICACY OF WHAT IS MORE BROADLY TERMED CULTURALLY RELEVANT PEDAGOGY. CONCLUDE THAT SUCH CURRICULUM CONSISTENTLY HAS POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND STUDENTS IN GENERAL. THOUGH MOST OF THIS RESEARCH IS QUALITATIVE AND MASTER MORE RECENT QUANTITATIVE MASSES OF FINDINGS BASED ON RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOLS THAT PILOTED ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES FOUND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN DAILY ATTENDANCE. GRADE POINT AVERAGE AND COMPLETION OF COURSE CREDIT ESPECIALLY FOR HOLDING COURT AT RISK STUDENTS WHO ENROLLED IN THESE COURSES. I COULD PERSONALLY SUPPORT THESE FINDINGS BASED ON MY PILOT PROJECTS OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS WORKING WITH HISTORY TEACHERS TO INSTITUTE ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM AT TO CHARTER HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA EAST PALO ALTO ACADEMY HIGH AND THE LUIS VALDEZ LEADERSHIP ACADEMY IN SAN JOSE. I CAN ATTEST THAT STUDENTS WHO ENROLLED IN OUR ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM AT BOTH SCHOOLS WERE MORE INTELLECTUALLY ENGAGE MORE MOTIVATED TO LEARN AND MUCH MORE COLLEGE READY THAN THEIR PEERS. WHO DID NOT ENROLL IN THESE COURSES. I DON'T THINK STUDIES CORE RECALL NOW ASSUME BULLET TO SOLVE.

THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN IN THEM FINDING MYSELF IN SUPPORT OF- OF THE MEASURE RIGHT. I HAVE A QUESTION I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO CAN BEST ADDRESS IT BUT AT A DO THINK WE HEARD- FROM POLICE ONE PERSON ON THE OPPOSITION LINE- TALKING ABOUT- THE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE- ISSUES END OTHERS CONCERNED GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF HOW THE HEATER EDUCATION- COMMUNITY ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTS- WHAT IS THE RESPONSE TO THAT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I MEAN I KNOW OUR COMMITTEE. I GUESS THIS IS THE PART WHERE I DON'T EXPECT THE CHAIR TO ANSWER THIS BUT WE ALL KNOW WE DON'T REALLY HAVE. A CONTINUING JURISDICTION- SORT OF DOWNSTREAM YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THAT KIND OF MONITORING ALTHOUGH WE CAN CERTAINLY ALWAYS. COME BACK WITH- YOU KNOW SOME SORT OF ADJUSTMENTS BUT BUT IN THE IN THE NEAR TERM WHAT IS THE RESPONSE TO IN THE REASSURANCE TO FOLKS THAT. THAT- IT THAT THEIR CONCERNS WILL BE WILL BE ADDRESSED- YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY GIVEN AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF AUTONOMY WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR DAISY FOR YOUR- FOR YOUR QUESTION WHICH I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION AND ONE THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY BEEN DISCUSSED- THAT THAT I DO WANT TO ADDRESS. AND AS YOU SAID AS YOU RECOGNIZE- OUR SYSTEM OF EDUCATION IN THE IN THIS COUNTRY. RIGHT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS- GIVES MUCH OF THE CONTROL TO LOCAL FOLKS I WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I WAS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT THAT IT IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE- OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT FORM. OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AB COUNTRY LIKE MY JAPAN ARE VERY MUCH MORE CENTRAL RIGHT WHERE WE'RE MAYBE WHAT IS TAUGHT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY MAYBE VERY SIMILAR IF YOU WENT FROM OR OR- IF YOU WENT A ONE SCHOOL TO ANOTHER. BUT HERE WE- BECAUSE WE ARE DEMOCRACY WE INTENTIONALLY MAKE- EDUCATION- OF THE FORM THAT THAT EVERYONE CAN PARTICIPATE IN AND WE GIVE UP PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL INPUT AND SO THAT IS HOW. ETHNIC STUDY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. AS YOU MAY KNOW READ THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I CAME UP WITH A MODEL CURRICULUM- IT WENT THROUGH DIFFERENT REVISIONS. MUCH MANY HEARINGS A LOT OF PUBLIC INPUT- IT WAS A- RE DONE. AND NOW THIS LAST MARCH IT CAME OUT OF THE MODEL CURRICULUM AS ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. THAT MODEL CURRICULUM IS JUST THAT IT IS A MODEL FOR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO USE AS THEY IMPLEMENT ETHNIC STUDIES THERE ARE TWENTY DISTRICTS ALREADY- WHO ARE FOR. OR REQUIRED I THINK STUDIES AS A AS A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. AND SO WE SEE DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SOMETIMES HOTLY DEBATING RIGHT WHAT FORM OF ETHNIC STUDIES SHOULD TAKE. AND I THINK THAT WE HEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO HAVE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM THE THAT WE CREATED IN A SYSTEM OF EDUCATION. THAT WE HAVE- RELIED ON AND THAT WORKS AND THAT AND THAT IS PART TO HAVE FAITH ALSO IN THE DEMOCRATIC- PROCESS THAT IT IS THROUGH DISCUSSION. AND THROUGH GIVE AND TAKE THAT- THE BEST CATION I THINK IS ACHIEVED AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE ETHNIC STUDIES. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS I WAS A TEACHER FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS. A SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WILL USE THE MODEL CURRICULUM. TO FORM THEIR OWN CURRICULUM IN IN THE SCHOOLS- BASED ON THE MODEL CURRICULUM BUT ALSO GIVEN THE LOCAL HISTORY AND POPULATION AND I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE YOU KNOW WE SAY HERE MANY TIMES THAT ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL AND I BELIEVE THAT SO THE MODEL CURRICULUM IS JUST THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL USE IT. USE IT- AS A MODEL TO MAKE A BEST FIT. A LOCAL AREA. AND SOMETIMES A DEMOCRAT DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IS MESSY. BUT WE SHOULD NOT SHY AWAY FROM HAVING DIFFICULT DISCUSSIONS BUT I THINK THAT IS SORT OF VIA THE PROCESSES THAT WILL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF TEACHERS ARE GONNA BE TRAINING. A TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES- WE'VE ALREADY SEEN MANY. ALLOCATED IN THE IN THE BUDGET FOR THAT. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND JUST THROUGH THE CHAIR I JUST WANNA SAY I HAVE SOME OR SOME SIMILAR BACKGROUND EXPERIENCE TO YOU IT IS A SERVICE SUPPORT LOCAL CONTROL- IS LOCALIZES POSSIBLE IN MOST CASES I DO THINK THE CONCERNS ARE- ARE ALWAYS VALID BILL IF. YOUR FIRM DESPITE. YOU KNOW THE BEST PHILOSOPHIES WILL CONTROL SOMEBODY CROSSES A LINE YOU KNOW WHAT GUARD RAILS ARE IN PLACE TO BRING THEM BACK AND I AM NOT ASKING YOU FOR AN EXTENDD RESPONSE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT- IF YOU LEASES ONE COMMITTEE MEMBER HERE JUST ONE SENATOR THAT. THE THOSE WHO HAVE THOSE CONCERNS UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THEY'RE BEING HEARD IN THE THERE IS THERE SOME SHARING OF THOSE CONCERNS RELATIVE TO- YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT. AGAIN OF GUARD RAILS ARE IN PLACE UNDERSTAND THE MODEL CURRICULUM IS ONE OF THOSE- BUT AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THE MANAGER OF YES PLEASE REFER TO TWO COMMENTS ABSOLUTELY. THE FIRST I DID HEAR THE OPPOSITION RIGHT OTHER FOLKS WHO PRESENTED IN AN OPPOSITION- I WANT TO SHARE. THAT I HAVE TWO ADULT CHILDREN- TWO ADULT CHILDREN WHO WENT TO A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS BOTH OF THEM. BOTH MY CHILDREN ARE JEWISH. AND THEN MY SON UP WHEN HE WAS IN IN SCHOOL HAD ANOTHER STUDENT DRAW A SWASTIKA ON HIS BACKPACK BECAUSE THAT STUDENT KNEW THAT HE WAS JEWISH MY SON- SO GIVEN THAT MY OWN EXPERIENCE. BUT TO JEWISH CHILDREN I WOULD. WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE IN FRONT OF THIS BODY ADVOCATING FOR SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT WAS ANTI SEMITIC. THAT THAT WAS ONE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IN THE OTHER POINT IS THAT- THIS LEGISLATION DOES HAVE GUARDRAILS- PUT IN IN COLLABORATION WITH THE JEWISH CAUCUS THAT VERY MUCH US STATE AND POINTS OUT THAT THERE WILL BE NO INSTRUCTION THAT- IS. PREJUDICIAL OR ANTI SEMITIC. THANK YOU AGAIN MANAGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WOULD JUST SAY TO CENTER CORTESE'S POINT I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS OUR CONCERN WE CHANGE SOMETHING RIGHT THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE RIGHT WAY- I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR HE'S WORKED IN NATION SLEEP FOR MANY YEARS ON THIS AND TRY TO ADDRESS EVERY ISSUE FROM OPPOSITION AND- AND DEMOCRACY CAN BE MESSY BUT DOING THE RIGHT THING NEEDS TO BE DONE US SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE I'M TRYING BOUNCE BETWEEN TWO COMMITTEES HERE NO WORRIES- UT- SO FIRST OF ALL- SUMMER MEDINA FOR SOMEONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED WORK ON THIS BILL I THINK I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE THROUGH BOLLIER RATIONS OF THIS BILL AND I KNOW HE SAID ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ABOUT THIS BILL- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD WITH THE READY STAKEHOLDERS- AND- YOU KNOW FOR THE OPPOSITION- I KNOW YOU'RE ANXIOUS ABOUT THIS AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY FEARS ASSOCIATED- BUT I THINK AS YOU SAID YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE FAITH IN OUR SYSTEM- YES WE DECIDE WE HEAR IN CALIFORNIA DECIDED TO- BASICALLY- ESTABLISH GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH SCHOOL IN- IN THE CODE. LEGISLATION THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WHY DIDN'T LEGISLATION IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THAT IS HOW WE STATUS GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS IS IN THE CODE BUT ALSO WE GIVE LATITUDE TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT FIRST A QUIEN SE- AND CONJUNCTION WITH OF COURSE THE PART OF EDUCATION WHICH SETS OUT GUIDELINES AND THAT'S A PROCESS THAT'S BEEN THROUGH AND TRACTORS AND INVARIOUS CHECK UPS AND DISCUSSIONS ALONG THE WAY- BUT I THINK YOU HAVE ALWAYS ACTED IN THE BEST SPACE. AND TRYING TO BE SURE WE BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER CERTAINLY YOU KNOW NOT EVERYONE ALWAYS AGREES AND WE HAVE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU PUT INTO IT AND- WELL I HAVE TO RUN UP TO NEXT MASON MY MIGHT NOT MIGHT NOT BE HERE FOR THE VOTE RIGHT NOW I DO WANT TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THE BILL AND MY GRATITUDE FOR YOUR ON. THANK YOU THINKING. GENDER PEN CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR. I WANT TO START BY. THE I REALLY HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS AUTHOR AND- ALSO I WANT TO SAY THAT THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE AS ONE OF MANY COMMITTEES I SIT ON I WANT TO THANK. THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET REALLY GOOD INFORMATION AND I DON'T ALWAYS GET THAT ON OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE AS A REPUBLICAN BUT WE'VE GOT. A FULL PACKET OF THE SAME THING THAT THE CHAIR HAS AND I AM THAT'S REFRESHING I JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT. WE ARE THE BILL ITSELF- I DID A BILL. WE'VE HAD SEX EDUCATION THAT'S THAT'S CURRICULUM THAT'S TAUGHT IN CALIFORNIA AND I DID A BILL EARLIER IN THIS COMMITTEE TO TRY TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT THE CURRICULUM IS AND ACTUALLY GET IT POSTED ONLINE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF CONFLICTS IN THAT AREA. AND IT IS MESSY JUST AS THE AUTHOR STATED ABOUT THIS BILL AND SO WHEN WE PASSED LEGISLATION AND WE MANDATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TEACH SOMETHING. AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT THE CURRIULUM IS GONNA LOOK LIKE AND THEY DO HAVE. LOCAL CONTROL TO BE ABLE TO. THE COME UP WITH WHAT THEY- THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR THEIR THEIR SCHOOL BOARD AND THEIR- TEACHERS. ARE GOING TO DO BUT THIS THIS GUIDES THERE'S A THERE'S GUIDANCE ALONG THE WAY WITH THAT. TO WARRANT HEADING WITH THIS WAS THE- LIBERATED ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM. THAT WAS PUT OUT- IS ONLY THING OUT THERE RIGHT NOW AND AS THE OPPOSITION TALKED ABOUT- THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT CORRECT ONE. BUT THAT'S THE ONLY THING AVAILABLE TODAY. THAT MANY RULE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO DON'T HAVE THE- RESOURCES THE TIME THE EXPERTISE THE KNOW HOW TO PUT TOGETHER A CURRICULUM ARE GONNA BE FORCED TO MAKE A DECISION IF THIS BILL IS SIGNED INTO LAW SO CAN YOU ADDRESS- WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN THIS TIME FRAME THIS THIS BILL IS GOING TO COME INTO LAW. THEN THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT HAS BEEN. PROPOSED WHICH WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL EVEN THE GOVERNOR THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THE TREASURER OF THE STATE THE JEWISH LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS THE HOOVER INSTITUTE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THE HINDU AMERICAN FOUNDATION THE CREE AMERICAN COALITION ALL OPPOSED IT. ALONG WITH THE FOLKS IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY SO. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TIMING OF THIS BILL AND- WHAT CRITICAL WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE VERY SMALL THERE'S THOUSANDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR STATE THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO COME UP WITH THIS. TYPE OF- WELL BALANCED- CURRICULUM. I WORKED WITH A PROFESSOR AT UC RIVERSIDE HIS NAME IS A DOCTOR CARLOS CORTES IT WAS MY PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AT UC RIVERSIDE. I ADMIRE HIS WORK VERY MUCH. I WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THE BILL CENTER DOLLY I WORKED WITH DOCTOR CORTES. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THE DOCTOR CORTEZ SAID TO ME IS THAT THIS CURRICULUM HAD TO BE A CURRICULUM THAT WOULD BE. AFFECTED IN IN LOS ANGELES AS MUCH AS IT HAD TO BE EFFECTIVE. IN RED BLUFF VENTURA RED BLUFF IS. BUT I AGREED WITH HIM ON THAT- THAT THAT WE NEED A CURRICULUM THAT THAT YOU KNOW FITS. IN IN THE LOCAL AREAS. BUT I THINK THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS GOTTEN IS THERE- I WOULD DISAGREE RESPECTFULLY THAT THIS. SO CALLED LIBERATED ETHNIC STUDIES IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S OUT THERE I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE THE MODEL CURRICULUM THAT THE STATE. HAS IS NINE HUNDRED PAGES. NINE HUNDRED PAGES THAT INCLUDES LESSON PLANS- APPENDICES- RESOURCES. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO USE. AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT THE TIMING OF THE BILL. AS I SAID AT THE OUTSET BUT THIS. WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT. UNTIL STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING IN THE YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY NINE TWENTY THIRTY WHICH MEANS IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE IN PLACE. AND TELL TWENTY TWENTY SIX. I BELIEVE FOR GRADUATES TO GRADUATE IN TWENTY TWENTY NINE. IN OTHER WORDS WE ARE GIVING. I THINK OUT AMPLE TIME TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA TO WORK ON JUST THAT CENTER DOLLY ON THE CURRICULUM ON HOW AND TRAINING TEACHERS- EIGHT ZERO IT IT'S A BIG STEP. UP NO DOUBT. BUT I THINK THAT IF IT IS. SOMETHING THAT IS OVERDUE. IN THIS STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY. AS A TEACHER OF US HISTORY. THE THERE IS SO MUCH OF OUR OWN HISTORY THAT IS LEFT OUT. OF A OF THE CURRICULUM NOW. IN THAT STUDENTS LIKE WE HEARD ARE CLAMORING FOR- TO SEE THEMSELVES IN THE CURRICULUM YOU KNOW THAT I COULDN'T. BEGIN WITH THE STORY OF ANGEL ISLAND. AND THEN- CHINESE IMMIGRATION- WITH WITH THE TREATY WELL LOU BAY THAT'LL ENDED THE MEXICAN WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES- THE TO DO RIGHTS WITH THE GREAT MIGRATION. OF AFRICAN AMERICANS FROM THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH ALL THESE STORIES STORY OF CHINESE AMERICANS IN THE RAILROADS ALL THESE STORIES- NEED TO BE TOLD AND RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT SO THAT IS WHY WE ARE HEARING FROM STUDENTS WHO ARE SAYING THAT THEY WANT TO SEE IT THANK STUDIES IMPLEMENT I THINK WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT. IN THE STATE. I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS AGAIN- I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE FACT THAT. WE NEED TO TEACH GOOD ACTORS HISTORY AND- BUT IN DOING THAT. THE GOAL IS TO UNITE US NOT DIVIDE US THAT'S THAT'S I THINK WHY THIS IS THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A CAN- IT'S DRIVEN BY MOTION IS DRIVEN BY THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT THAT WE NEED TO LEARN SO I JUST WANT TO ON MY OWN TIME MANAGER I I'M BILL TODAY- AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE WORKED REALLY HARD AT IT TO THE WHICH YOU ALWAYS DO ON YOUR BILLS BUT I JUST WANTED TO. SHARE SOME THOUGHTS THAT. WHY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PARENTS AND I'M ONE OF THOSE PARENTS WHO HOUSE OTHER THAN AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER- WHO IS. IS ATTENDING A PRIVATE SCHOOL- RIGHT NOW BUT WAS. THAT WHEN WE WERE WHEN WE HAD HER IN SCHOOL IN BEEPER BEFORE BOTH OF US BECAME ELECTED HERE- WE BROUGHT HER TO SACRAMENTO SO SHE'S GETTING EDUCATION HERE IT IS IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL. BUT BOTH MY SONS AND MY DAUGHTER FOR THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF HER LIFE ATTENDED PUBLIC SCHOOL SO. VERY MUCH ENGAGED IN THAT PROCESS AND WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING- IN MY OPINION IS. A LOT OF GOOD. CURRICULUM IS THOUGHT OUT IN BUT IT GETS STORED ALONG THE WAY AND ACCESS FOR THE PARENTS AND I AND I'M BACKING UP TO MY- TO MY BILL ON SEX EDUCATION THAT I HAD EARLIER THIS YEAR AND- THE ABILITY FOR PARENTS TO WAY AND MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT AND- THAT WORK. AND THE SCHOOLS AREN'T VERY TRANSPARENT AND PEOPLE ARE EXITING. PUBLIC SCHOOLS. INCLUDING MYSELF. I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO SEND. MY CHILD TO PUBLIC SCHOOL AND I AND I HATE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE- I PAY FOR. NEARLY PAY FOR AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE QUESTIONING WHAT WE REALLY GETTING. AND THE PARENTS OF THESE CHILDREN DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GETTING. WHAT THEY WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO BE TAUGHT. AND SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO BRING THOSE BRING EVERYBODY AND NOT JUST THE KIDS THAT HAVE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY OR THE PARENTS OF THE BELIEVE IT TAKE ANOTHER CHOICE. WE'VE WE'VE PUSHED OUT CHARTER SCHOOLS WE DON'T FUND IN THE SAME WAY AS WE- FUND PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THERE'S A AN ATTACK ON. ANYBODY THAT TRIES TO GET AWAY FROM A SYSTEM THAT IS NOT REALLY IN MY OPINION DOING A GREAT JOB SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME THOUGHTS OF MINE. BUT I THINK THE PUBLIC IS OUT THERE GRASPING WITH AND THE ABILITY FOR THEIR MONEY TO FALL THEIR CHILD. AND THEN GET ACCESS TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING TAUGHT. IS VERY FRUSTRATING. AND I THINK THIS BILL. EVENTUALLY WILL BE THE SAME AS PLATE SPACE THAT MY SEX WHICH WHICH IS WHERE SEX EDUCATION IS THAT IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ACCESS. IT AND ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IS BEING TAUGHT BECAUSE HOW IT'S BEING TAUGHT. AND WHAT IS BEING TAUGHT IS CRITICAL IT'S YOUNG MINDS TO. HOPEFULLY BRING US TOGETHER NOT DIVIDE US APART ON WHERE WE THINK OUR CHILDREN TO GO AND PARENTS SEEM TO BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION AND WHEN THEY DON'T FEEL THEY CAN'T THEY TRY TO EXIT BUT WHEN THEY TRY TO EXIT. THE MONEY DOESN'T FALL SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME THOUGHTS APPRECIATE YOU AS AN AUTHOR AND A FRIEND- BUT I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER DOLLY- SENATOR I HAVE TO SAY I WHOLEHEARTEDLY DISAGREE WITH YOU ABOUT OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. I THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. IN THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO DO BETTER. AND WHEN WE FIND A PROBLEM. TO TRY AND FIX IT AND MAKE PUBLIC EDUCATION BETTER FOR OUR CHILDREN. AND I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY THAT. I THINK JUST THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES. I THINK IT BRINGS US CLOSER TOGETHER. BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE FIND OUT WE ARE HAVE MORE IN COMMON. THAN THAT NOT. WHEN WE LEARN ABOUT EACH OTHER WE LEARN THAT WE ALL HAVE FAMILIES WE ALL LEARNED THAT WE HELPED. HER YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL PEOPLE TRYING TO. TO SURVIVE IN THIS WORLD SO I THINK THAT MAKE CITIES. BRINGS US CLOSER TOGETHER- BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS LET ME JUST SAY I'M NOT OPPOSED TO ETHNIC STUDIES. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO IT IN A WAY. THAT IT'S INCLUSIVE AND THAT PEOPLE GET TO BE. I'M NOT I'M NOT BECAUSE I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAY I'M NOT DISAGREEING THE ETHNIC STUDIES ART. SOMETHING WE SHOULD TEACH ABSOLUTELY IT'S MAKING SURE THAT. IT IS THE CURRICULUM THAT IS OUT THERE IS. ACCURATE AND BRINGS US TOGETHER AND NOT USED TO DEVISE A PART OR- AGAINST ONE OF THE OTHER THAT'S WHAT AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD AND I'VE BEEN HEARING. FROM MY DISTRICT I DON'T DISAGREE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE IT. I THINK WE SHOULD IT'S NOT A PROBLEM BUT IT'S HOW WE DO IT THAT MATTERS. AGAIN I WOULD SAY TO THAT THE CURRICULUM THAT YOU FIRST MENTIONED. HAS BEEN CHANGED IN THIS BILL THE MASTER CURRICULUM SOME OF THE POINTS HE TALKED ABOUT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT AND CHANGE THE AUTHOR DID THAT. TO MAKE IT MORE INCLUSIVE SO YOU KNOW I THINK AS A SOCIETY WE TRY TO JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER RIGHT. ALL RIGHT TO HAVE ANY OTHER FURTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS CENTER PAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU- AND- IT REALLY FREESHEET THE DISCUSSION- BUT I DO IT JUST MAKE THE OBSERVATION THAT. ACTUALLY THE TONES WERE CONCERNED THAT DESPITE THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE AND THE- STATE CURRICULUM THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED WHAT HAPPENED AND LOCAL AREAS INTERESTING ENOUGH- WE ACTUALLY WANT MORE LOCAL INPUT AND CONTROL RIGHT AND THAT'S HOW WE SET UP OUR SYSTEM. SO I THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND THEN JUST FOR THE WORK TO DO I AGREE YOU KNOW PARENTS AND SCHOOL BOARDS AND TEACHERS NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AND EACH LOCALITY. SO THE PEOPLE OF OUR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS. WELL ENGAGE BECAUSE WE DON'T WE DON'T DICTATE IT FROM THE TOP WE'RE ESTABLISHING A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT BUT EXACTLY AND I APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE THE ODDS BROAD SUPPORT FOR ETHNIC STUDIES HERE- SO I THINK THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AREA OF COMMON AGREEMENT TO APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN HOW WE IMPLEMENT THAT- WILL TAKE ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT- WAYS DEPENDING ON HOW EACH OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES COME TOGETHER TO DO THAT. SO THAT'S BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY I ALSO HEAR THIS YEAR THE OPPONENTS ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS BUT I HOPE THAT WE CAN SEE THIS AND OPPORTUNITIES A ORGANIZATION HERE'S A LEGISLATURE WE'VE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL ENGAGEMENT THAT'S HOW WE SET UP OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM SO- SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND SET THE GOAL HERE AS WELL TO DO THIS BILL AND THEN I A- THANK THAT WE ALL WORK- CLEAN PARENTS WHETHER YOU SUPPORT OR OPPOSE. ENGAGE WITH YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND DEVELOP THE- THE AT. THE DEVELOP THE PROGRAM AS- YEAH WE WANT YOU CAN YOU FOR OBVIOUSLY WE PROVIDE GUIDELINES SINCE THE STATE AND WE WORK PEOPLE WORK VERY HARD ON THAT TO GIVE PEOPLE SOME GUIDANCE. BUT LET'S GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WORK TOGETHER- IS A SAID. WE ALL WORK TOGETHER AND I GET A CURRICULUM THAT. ENSURES THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS A MATTER WHERE THEY CAME FROM. OTHER BACKGROUNDS ARE- CAN LEARN. ABOUT OUR HISTORY TOGETHER. AND TAKE THE LESSONS FROM THAT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY THAT'S BEING POSED BY THIS BILL TODAY SO. AGAIN THANK YOU I PREFER COLLEGES WERE SPEAKING TWICE BUT NOT. JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT FINAL COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAM CENTER CHOKE- GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA- I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT- HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE CONCERN OR THE REQUEST BY MANY TO MAKE AB ONE A ONE A TO YOUR BILL IN ORDER FOR IT TO HAVE AND I KNOW IT'S YOU'VE IT'S BEEN A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT- CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION JUST CAME UP WITH THE CURRICULUM OR THE MODEL. IN IN MARCH GIVING SOME TIME TO HAVE- JUST TO BE MORE TO HAVE MORE TIME IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AT AT THE CURE HIM A LITTLE FURTHER OUT FOR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. YEAH WELL- THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT IN QUESTION AND I CHUCKLED UNDERNEATH MY MASK BECAUSE AS- DR PAN DR LEYVA SENATOR DOLLY- NO THIS IS MY THIRD TIME COMING UP HERE- PRESENTING. TO THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE- THIS BILL AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW WA VETOED TWICE IN THE LAST TIME IT WAS VETOED. BY OUR GOVERNOR IT WAS JUST BECAUSE OF THE CURRICULUM THAT HE DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WITH THE CURRICULUM AS IT WAS AND IN HIS VETO MESSAGE HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO SEE A MORE BALANCED CURRICULUM. AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW. A MORE BALANCED CURRICULUM- THE CURRICULUM THAT I THINK WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF. AND THAT CURRICULUM WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS IN THE MAKING- AND AGAIN THIS IS MY THIRD TIME- PRESENTING THE BILL- I THINK THAT IF WE WOULD GO TO STUDENTS STUDENTS WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS LONG OVERDUE- ETHNIC STUDIES HAS BEEN A DISCIPLINE FOR FIFTY YEARS. IT'S GOING BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT OVER FIFTY YEARS THAT'S FIFTY YEARS OF RESEARCH THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE FIFTY YEARS OF NEW KNOWLEDGE- THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED PRODUCED BY ACADEMICS. PRODUCED BY HISTORIANS. THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN OUR CURRICULUM SO I WOULD SAY TO YOUR QUESTION THE WE DON'T HAVE MORE TIME. WE NEED TO DO IT NOW. WE'RE GIVING PLENTY OF TIME FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS TO IMPLEMENT THE CURRICULUM BUT THE TIME TO PASS IT IS NOW. AND I WOULD SAY TO SENATOR- CHIU ABOVE THE CURRICULUM IF IT PASS AND GOES INTO LAW DOES NOT TO BE IMPLEMENTED TILL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE SO THAT WILL GIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE TIME THAT YOU CAN YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SO HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS. MEMBERS WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL. THANK YOU CENTER PAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA YOU MAY CLOSE. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO IN CLOSING SAY THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF MISINFORMATION OUT THERE IN THIS REGARDS A LOT OF MISINFORMATION- IN THE MEDIA. A LOT OF MISINFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC AND SO I JUST WANNA CLARIFY. ONE THING- ETHNIC STUDIES AND THE TECHNIQUE STUDIES CURRICULUM- THAT THAT THAT IS PRODUCED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS NOT CRITICAL RACE THEORY CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS SOMETHING THAT IS TAUGHT. IN LAW SCHOOLS IT IS NOT THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL. OR THE CURRICULUM. BUT TO HAVE CRITICAL RACE THEORY- THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT STUDENTS. IN LEARN WHEN THEY ARE OLDER AND GO OFF TO COLLEGE BUT- THIS IS NOT CRITICAL RACE THERE AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU SOME A MEMBER AND I WILL AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSEVERANCE IN THIS AREA I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MADAM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

I DO APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT- THE SHIFTING MISSIONS IN BENTON FRANKLY- AND I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. THIS IS KIND DRIVEN BY WHAT CALL CREDENTIALS- SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS AND WE ALSO SEE THE CSU IS THAT. FIELDS THAT TRADITIONALLY WERE TAUGHT BY WHETHER IT'S COMMITTEE COLLEGES OR CSCS WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT DAVE. CONSTANTLY INCREASE THE DEGREE REQUIREMENTSFOR ENTRY INTO THE FIELD SO WHAT USED TO. CORNICES YOU THREE NOW REQUIRES A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WHAT REQUIRED BACHELOR'S DEGREE REQUIRED MASTER'S DEGREE. AND OF COURSE THAT CREATES CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF THAT FIELD IS TRADITIONALLY TAUGHT BY COMMUNITY COLLEGES STAND IF THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO THAT. AND THEY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ALL THE EDUCATORS AND SO FORTH THEY HAVE TO NOW BE ABLE TO OFFER BACHELOR'S OTHERWISE. THE STUDENTS CAN'T ACTUALLY ENTER THE FIELD AND WE ALSO SAW STATUS AT CSU TO WHERE. THEY'RE ASKING US FOR MASTER'S DEGREES AND DOCTORATES WORKS ONLY IT'S- SO I APPRECIATE YOU TOOK THE AMENDMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CULTURE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE HAVE MORE MORE BACHELOR'S DEGREE BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY'RE- KIND OF VICTIMS OF. OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF. LIKE ALL THIS CREDENTIALS AND I ALSO DID IN THE CERTAINLY ISN'T AN ISSUE WITH YOUR BILL SPECIFICALLY BUT IT'S ARE PART OF LARGER ISSUE IS THAT. AS YOU CAN CONSTANTLY ALSO RAISES CREDENTIALS WERE ALSO RISK INCREASING THE FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO PEOPLE ENTERING THESE FIELDS SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS. AND SO CERTAINLY I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING THE BILL OFFICIALLY SPONSOR ON THIS OF THE BILL- BUT MY AGAIN JUST RAISES. ISSUE ABOUT. EACH FIELD CONSTANTLY POPPING THE CREDENTIALS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE FIELD WHICH THEN MAKES IT MORE EXPENSIVE PEOPLE ENTRY. ENTER INCREASES THE L. C. LOANS ALL THAT OTHER STUFF AND- WE REALLY SHOULD THINK. NOW IT'S A LITTLE HARD FOR US THE LEGISLATURE TO SET RULES AROUND IT BUT HOPEFULLY AS A SOCIETY WE'RE THINKING ABOUT. IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY AND WHY ARE WE DOING THIS BECAUSE EXACTLY SO. EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD YOU KNOW THEY'RE STILL DEALING COMMITTEE COLLEGE BUT THE BEST IS GONNA BE LONGER AND ASSOCIATES SO WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT MORE MONEY MORE TIME IT'S CETERA. YET AND I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT SO THANK YOU FOR GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY EXPRESS THAT- AND CERTAINLY WILL SUPPORT YOUR BILL- BUT- ALSO ONE BE SURE WE MAINTAIN THE--CHARACTER OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN A WAY. THAT WE IT'S NOT DOMINATED BY- THE BATCHES DEGREE SEEKING AND THAT LEADS TO THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE STILL PRESERVED. WITHIN THE CULTURE. AND SO. YOUR DOCTOR PAN THAT'S A GOOD POINT YOU MAKE WE SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNS.

CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM SUPPORTS OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS SEEKING POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND A BETTER LIFE EACH YEAR. THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES MORE THAN TWO BILLION. ANNUALLY TOWARD FINANCIAL AID. IS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE STATE'S LONGSTANDING COMMITMENT TO ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE HIGHER EDUCATION. NEVER THE LESS THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED SIX DECADES AGO. AND NO LONGER MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE STATE'S STRUGGLING COLLEGE STUDENTS. OF THESE PROBLEMS CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY RULES ARE GEARED TOWARD STUDENTS ATTENDING COLLEGE DIRECTLY AFTER FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL. STUDENTS INELIGIBLE FOR THE CAL GRANT ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM. DUE TO AGE WHEN THEY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL OR GPA MUST COMPETE FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF AWARDS. THROUGH THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. THEREFORE ONLY ONE OF EVERY EIGHT ELIGIBLE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS ARE TYPICALLY AWARDED TO CAL GRANT THROUGH THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT SAYS TO ENSURE MORE CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE DEGREE. COMPREHENSIVE REFORM IS NEEDED. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX DOES THE FOLLOWING CONSOLIDATES THE THREE CAL GRANT AWARDS INTO A NEW CAL GRANT TO AND CAL GRANT FOR PROGRAM. CAL GRANT TO WILL GUARANTEE AN AXIS AWARD FOR ALL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WELL CAL GRANT FOR WILL MAINTAIN THE TUITION FEES AWARD TO STUDENTS.

THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING CHAIR LEYVA AND SENATORS I'M JAKE BRUNNER I'M SERVED AS THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS AT THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX REFLECTS WORK THAT HAS BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING TO SIMPLIFY AND EXPAND THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS INCLUDING A DELIBERATIVE PROCESS IN WHICH STUDENTS HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS AND OTHER EDUCATION ADVOCATES CAME TOGETHER IN THE CAL GRANT REFORM. WORK GROUP- TO THE ONSET OF KOBE NINETEEN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS FOOD AND HOUSING AS THEY PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION. WE KNOW THAT KOBE NINETEEN AND THE RELATED ECONOMIC IMPACTS I'VE ONLY COMPOUNDED THAT CHALLENGE WHEN WE SURVEYED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND INCOMING RETURNING COLLEGE STUDENTS LAST YEAR. MORE THAN SEVEN OUT OF TEN INDICATED THAT THEY OR THEIR FAMILY LOST SOME OR ALL OF THEIR INCOME DO TO COPE IN NINETEEN. AND THE FOLLOWING SURVEY STUDENTS REPORTED THAT THEIR COSTS FOR PUTIN HOUSING INCREASE DURING THE PANDEMIC. ALL THIS YEAR'S BUDGET MAKES A HISTORIC EXPANSION TO CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY FOR WHICH WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR. THERE WILL STILL BE BARRIERS TO STUDENTS IN ACCESSING CAL GRANT A IN THAT ARE NOT BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL NEED OR ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM HIGHER EDUCATION. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX REMOVES THE SPINAL BARRIERS TO ALLOW US TO BEST LEVERAGE THESE NEW INVESTMENTS FOR STUDENTS. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX ALSO STREAMLINED THE CAL GRANTS SYSTEM BY ESTABLISHING THE CAL GRANT TO AND THE CAL GRANT FOR WHICH REFLECT THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS RESPECTIVELY THE SYSTEM WILL BE EASIER FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES PARTICULARLY WHO ARE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE GOERS. TO UNDERSTAND AND PLAN AROUND. ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MEDINA AND MCCARTY FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS BECAUSE AS WELL AS CARE LEYVA. AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION.

I THINK THAT ACADEMIC STATUS ESPECIALLY FOR THEIR FIRST WITH THE MASTERS AFTER BEING AWAY FROM SCHOOL WHILE OR COMING FROM UNDERFUNDED SCHOOL CAN BE DIFFICULT. WITH NEGATIVE DST THAT TAKING AWAY OUR LACK OF FUNDING BASED ON HAVING A MORE DIFFICULT TIME IT'S A DECISION DOCTOR BUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN CONTINUE AN INCREASE.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON IS PRESENTING ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB FIVE TWENTY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE TWENTY WHICH WOULD ECSTATIC CALIFORNIA DIVERSIFYING THE TEACHER WORKFORCE GRANT PROGRAM THIS GRANT WOULD SUPPORT A NEW OR EXISTING LOCAL EFFORTS AIMED TO BUILD A MORE DIVERSE TEACHER WORKFORCE THAT MORE CLOSELY REPRESENTS OUR STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS EFFORT IS BASED ON A PILOT PROGRAM BY THE COUNTY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT TO IMPROVE RETENTION RATES OF MALE TEACHERS OF COLOR. WHO HAVE SOME OF THE LOWER RETENTION RATES TODAY MEN OF COLOR REPRESENTS LESS THAN WORKFORCE OF THAT 10% BLACKS AND LATINO MALES MAKES UP 122% BUT- STUDENTS OF COLOR MAKES UP POPULATION. THESE ARE TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCES IN THE BIGGER PICTURE THIS IS THIS IS REALLY ABOUT STUDENTS WHEN STUDENTS CAN IDENTIFY WITH THEIR TEACHER AND SEE THEMSELVES AS ROLE MODELS THEY ULTIMATELY. ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL THEY SHOW A GREATER CONFIDENCE AND PROPEL THEM TO PURSUE AND ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS THIS IS WHERE THE POWER REALLY COMES FROM. WE REGULARLY TALK ABOUT EQUITY THIS BILL WILL PUT IN PLACE EQUITY FRONT AND CENTER AS A PRIORITY TO IMPROVE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT WE NEED TO CREATE A BETTER SPACE. FOR OUR STUDENTS TO GROW TO LEARN AND SUCCEED FAR MORE THAN WHAT ANY NUMBER- HAVE SHOWN IN THE PAST AB FIVE TWENTY WOULD PROVIDE THE RIGHT SUPPORT TO DIVERT TO DIVERSIFY THE TEACHER WORKFORCE TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE STUDENTS THEY SERVE. JOINING ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY ON THE PHONE I'M HAPPY TO INTRODUCE- THE CALIFORNIA SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION WAS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY MISTER TONY THURMOND AS WELL AS PROFESSOR FROM UC BERKELEY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION DR TRAVIS BRISTOL WHO WILL ALSO INTRODUCE.

I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY JUST ACKNOWLEDGING OUR INCREDIBLE EDUCATION WORK FORCE INTO CHEST CONTINUE TO SHOW MY APPRECIATION FOR WHAT. OUR ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED STAFF AND OUR STUDENTS HAVE DONE IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME WE HAVE A GREAT TEACHER WORKFORCE AND WE ALSO HAVE AN INCREDIBLY. DIVERSE STATE THAT CONTINUES TO BECOME MORE AND MORE DIVERSE ALL THE TIME. THAT CREATES AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ALSO DIVERSIFY OUR TEACHER WORKFORCE CHANCE THIS BILL IN IT CREATES- IN ITS SCOPE THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEGUN TO FOCUS ON BUILDING THE RIGHT PIPELINE AND SUPPORTS. YOU HAVE MORE MALE EDUCATORS OF COLOR I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS COULD YOU HEAR CONDUCTOR BRISTOL BUT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU DIVERSIFY THAT THE TEACHER WORKFORCE CHECK EVEN HAVING ONE TEACHER OF COLOR I'M PROVIDES ALL KINDS OF BENEFITS FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND FOR CHEAP FOR STUDENTS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS. IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS A MEASURE THAT IS SIMPLY JUST A WIN WIN AND SO AS WE LOOK AT HOW WE DIVERSIFY OUR TEACHER WORKFORCE EXPANDING PROGRAMS FOR MALE EDUCATORS OF COLOR. ONE IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THAT MEASURE YEAH YOU HEARD FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON THERE ARE GREAT EXAMPLES OF CONTINUITY FINANCE- IN THE STATE BAKERSFIELD SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND AT SOME OF OUR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS. THIS MEASURE WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW US TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THOSE EFFORTS TO EXPAND WITH THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR PROGRAMS LIKE RESIDENTS HE SUPPORTS IN OTHER KINDS OF SUPPORT. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN RECRUIT RETAIN. AND SUPPORT MORE MELANIE AT OF COLOR AS WE DO. OUR TEACHER WORK. I RESPECT ASK FOR YOUR BOATS ON A FIVE TWO. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SUPER.

ASSEMBLY NOTED THIS THE INVESTMENT VERSUS NEEDED AND- CERTAINLY HAVEN'T BEEN A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND VERY CLOSE TO PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW- EIGHT I HAVE A POSITIVE- RESPONSE TO. THE NEED EVEN BEYOND SOME OF THE REASONS THAT ARE. IN THE ANALYSIS HERE- THE QUESTION I FELT. IS REALLY IN TERMS OF THE NEED ON- ON THE LEGISLATIVE AND FISCAL SIDE GIVEN CAR WERE RAT WITH THIS BE AB ONE THIRTY BECAUSE- THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY THERE AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE MADE SOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IT'S HAPPENING THERE AND I ONLY ASKED. ME TO COMMITMENT COMMITMENT TO MYSELF YESTERDAY. AS A FIRST YEAR SENATOR AFTER GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS ESPECIALLY THE INTER HOUSE PROCESS WHERE I'M OFTEN ASKED BY THE OTHER HOUSE WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO FIX SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN TAKEN CARE OF AND I'M OFTEN A LITTLE BIT TAKEN ABACK BY THAT WHEN THE MEMBERS ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS BUT I'M REALIZING SOMETIMES WE DO HAVE TASSELS QUESTIONS IN IN HERE IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE TAKEN A LOT OF ACTION AS A LEGISLATURE ALREADY- A TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM IN ANY. OF JUST US YOU. I RESPOND TO THAT IF YOU'RE WILLING. THANK YOU SURE I'D AT. THIS OWN RESTAURANTS IN COURT YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY- AGAIN BASED ON THE STUDIES TO SHOW- THAT AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE TO THE POPULATION THAT I'VE MADE MENTION OF 75% OF THE STUDENT POPULATION CALIFORNIA OUR CHILDREN OF STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE TEACHER POLL WHERE YOU LOOK WE SEE 10% OF THE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS MAKES UP ONE OR 2% AND THEN YOU LOOK AT FURTHER THE STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE TO SHOW IF HE PLAYS A MALE TEACHER WHICH AGAIN WE ARE NEW IN MUNICH IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA- TO TRY TO SHOW YOUNG STUDENTS- ROLE MODELS. THAT LOOK LIKE THEM THE REFLECTS THEM- AND THE TEACHER AND THE STUDENT OUTCOME- AND THROUGH THE STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN IS THAT- IT REDUCES DROP OUT IT REDUCES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND IT ALSO CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO GO INTO EDUCATION AS WELL AND THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO AIM AT TO TRY TO BOOST- THAT'S REASON WHY THAT. THE MONEY IS PLACED IN THE POT THAT THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE BUDGET TO INCREASE- DID AND DIVERSIFY- THE TEACHING WORKFORCE- WE TRY TO FIT UP. THAT EXIST IN THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE EXISTS IS THAT THERE'S A LACK OF MALE TEACHERS- IN EDUCATION AND THIS WILL HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE- A NEW GENERATION OF MALE TEACHERS TO GO INTO EDUCATION AROUND AND ALSO BE THERE TO SUPPORT. OUR MALE STUDENT TEACHERS I. IF I DIDN'T ANSWER QUESTIONS PLEASE REFER TO THE CHAIR AND IT I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID. IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE INFORMS- THEM THAT A DECISION THAT WE NEED MORE DIVERSITY NOT ONLY THE TEACHING RANKS BUT IN THE MINISTRY RANKS AS WELL. AND I THINK THE- IS SORELY NEEDED- I DISAGREE WITH ANY OPPOSITION IT WAS THE OTHERWISE. WHAT I WAS REALLY ASKING IS MORE OR MORE NARAL QUESTION IN THE ANALYSIS. THE GNOSIS OF YOUR BILL. IT SAYS THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TRAILER BILL S. B. AB ONE THIRTY INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO ESTABLISH A TEACHER RESIDENCY. GRANT PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM WOULD REQUIRE THE CTC TO MAKE ONE TIME GRANTS DALY IS. TO ESTABLISH A NEW TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS WORK SPANS FRANKEN APPROVED ACCESS TO EXISTING TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT DOESN'T MEAN TEACHER SHORTAGE. FIELDS I THINK THAT WOULD BE. EXACTLY THE DEMOGRAPHIC YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HELLO EFFORTS TO RECRUIT DEVELOP SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR AND PROVIDE OUR REGION COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES TO. AND RETAIN A DIVERSE TEACHER WORKFORCE REFLECTS LOW BLOOD EDUCATIONAL AGENCY COMMUNITIES DIVERSITY. SO IF WE HAVE ACTED UPON THAT BOTH HOUSES LEGISLATURE BUT I'M JUST ASK THAT'S WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO IS YOUR THEN WHAT DOES THIS BILL COMMANDED BUT THIS BILL AND FIX THAT WE HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE NOT NOT THAT IT IS NEEDED I'M JUST. BUT I THOUGHT WE HAD OUR FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER IT ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE IN THE S. B. AB ONE THIRTY AND I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHY BETWEEN THE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH STUDENT ENROLLED AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY WHICH YOUR BILL CALLS FOR AND ANY ACTIONS THAT WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN AS A LEGISLATURE OF OUR AND OUR WHICH IS UNIVERSITY MILLION OUT THERE YEAH I WOULD JUST SIMPLY SAY THIS BILL. WILL MOVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BEFORE OUR BUDGET TRAILER BILL BEFORE EVEN- ACTUALLY VOTED ON THAT AND SO FOR ME- LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENS WHAT'S TAKING PLACE A COPY YOU KNOW BY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THEIR PILOT PROGRAM MALE TEACHERS A RETENTION OF COLOR- AND HOW THAT HAS TREMENDOUSLY WORK IN THAT GAVE THE IDEA FOR THIS BILL- THIS BEFORE YOU TODAY FIVE TWENTY AND ALSO THE WORK THAT OUR SUPERINTENDENTS A WE HAD. WE START THIS WORK BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE TO THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO HAVE THOSE KINDS CONVERSATIONS AND I'M HOPEFUL AND I'M GONNA TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS THAT MY BILL WAS ON SOMEONE'S BUYS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO GET TO THE SAME EXACT THING THAT ASSEMBLY BILL- A. B. FIVE TWENTY IS TRYING TO GET TO- TODAY WE'RE HAPPY THAT THIS MONEY IS IN THE. BUDGET TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. I APPRECIATE THE IN A- I.

BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS HAVE JUST BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. THE MORE RECENT PROGRAMS WE REVIEW THEM HAVE CERTAIN OBJECTIVES WE UNDERSTAND THEM AND FOR EXAMPLE THE- TAX CREDIT FOR ALL. OUR FILMS AND TELEVISION I JUST VOTED FOR SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR THAT SO SOME OF THEM WE KNOW. THEY'RE A WHOLE BUNCH THE RICHEST GRANDFATHER DAN AND WE'VE NEVER REALLY LOOKED AT. SO THERE IS ALSO A STATE AUDIT THAT FOUND THERE WAS JUST A LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND EVALUATION THAT MADE IT. DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE IF THESE OLDER TAX CREDITS OR EXEMPTIONS WERE FOR FAILING THE PURPOSE. TO ADDRESS THIS LACK OF OVERSIGHT AB FIVE FORTY FIVE REQUESTED THE UC RESEARCH CENTER. ANALYZED THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAT MAJOR TAX EXPENDITURES HAVE IN THE STATE. AND VERIFY ANY BENEFIT TO THE STATE GETS FROM THESE PROGRAMS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CURRENT REPORTS DON'T GIVE YOU CURRENT REPORTS CAN TELL YOU. HOW MUCH YOU'VE SPENT IN THE WAY OF TAX BENEFITS THEY CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE. TO THE ECONOMY OF THE STATE UNTIL THAT TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT'S WHY WE NEED YOU SEE- THEY WILL DETERMINE OPTIONS FOR IMPROVING THE PROGRAMS ARE REDUCING THEIR IMPACTS IN THE GENERAL FUND. AB FIVE FORTY FIVE PER PROVIDES TOOL FOR INFORMING OUR FUTURE POLICY DECISIONS. ENSURING THE BEST USE OF LIMITED PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA- TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION. VERY GOOD AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YES OKAY I'VE GOT LISTED KATIE HARTMAN AND SAMANTHA CORBIN.

PTA AND THE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB FIVE FORTY FIVE EVERYONE I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER COURT FOR HIS WORK. I DID MAKE A COUPLE OF POINTS AND AS YOU MAY KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RECORDED A TOTAL OF. SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXPENDITURES PROVIDED BY THE STATE LAST YEAR AND THAT NUMBER CONTINUES TO GROW EACH YEAR. YOU EXPENDITURES OBVIOUSLY HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE STATE BUDGET AND EDUCATION FUNDING. AND THINK THAT YOU KNOW APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE BUDGET AN DEDICATED TO KEEP YOUR FOURTEEN EDUCATION. MEANS THAT APPROXIMATELY THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS RE DIRECTED AWAY FROM SCHOOLS IN THE FORM OF TAX EXPENDITURES EACH YEAR. AND ADDITIONALLY AT THE AUTHORS THAT MANY OF THESE. AT THE EXPENDITURES HAD NEVER BEEN EVALUATED. THANK THAT DISPELLED SIMPLY PROVIDE THE STATE WITH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE MORE COSTLY TAX EXPENDITURES. TO DETERMINE IF THEIR ACCOMPLISHING THEIR INTENDED GOAL. EPA BELIEVES THAT OVERSIGHT IS ESSENTIAL GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE GENERAL FUND INCLUDING FUNDING FOR EDUCATION AND CHILD CARE HIGHER EDUCATION AND OTHER VITAL PROGRAM. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY AND AYE URGENT AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR MEMBERS IN AFRICA ON THE OF THE- PARKS WITH I THINK IS.

TAX EXPENDITURE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT THOSE THE MOST COSTLY ARE ACHIEVING THEIR INTENDED PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVES. AND THAT THEY'RE MAKING THE BEST USE OF LIMITED PUBLIC DOLLARS. OVER THE YEARS CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS HAVE INCREASINGLY TURNED TO TAX CREDIT TO ADVANCE POLICY INTEREST. PERHAPS WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING WE'RE DEBATING THE IMPACT OF THE TAX CREDIT. ON THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND. EVERY DAHLE OF TAX THAT ARE FUND A DOES NOT. ACOSTA YOU REVENUE WERE GIFTED NOT. REVENUE THE WITH OTHER PROVIDE CRITICAL PUBLIC INCLUDING FIRE.

OF OUR OWN ORGANIZATIONS- THE UC GROUP WILL BE ABLE TO DO THIS- AND- WILL HAVE A LOT MORE INFORMATION WE FINISH. THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS BILL HAD A COMMITTEE WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS THERE WILL BE NO RECOMMENDATIONS MADE. BY THE UC THERE WILL BE NO ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE. WE BELIEVE THIS THEN THE GOVERNOR WILL BE ABLE TO SIGN THE BILL SO I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MA'AM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WE HAVE A MOTION WAS CENTER CORTESE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX AB FIVE FORTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE OCHO A BOAT. PATROL BOAT NO COURTESY. COURTESY I. DALLI. DALLI NO GLAZER MCGUIRE PANTS WILL KEEP THAT BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU. NEXT UP IS FILE ITEM EIGHT AB NINE TWENTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN GOOD MORNING. AS SOON AS THE- PODIUM IS READY PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MANCHURIAN SENATORS- AND I WOULD LIKE TO THINK OF THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFFER THOUGHTFUL AND THOROUGH ANALYSIS. I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS RELATED TO THE SINGULAR GENERAL EDUCATION PATHWAY PROVISION. SPECIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS. AS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION I'VE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM STUDENTS WHO SHARED THEIR TRANSFER EXPERIENCE. THE MESSAGE WAS LOUD AND CLEAR THE TRANSFER PROCESS IS TOO COMPLEX CONFUSING AND DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE. AS CALIFORNIA RECOVERS FROM THE PANDEMIC NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS CRITICAL TO INCREASED DEGREE ATTAINMENT. IMPROVE TIME 2 DEGREES IN CLOSE RACIAL EQUITY GAPS. EIGHTY NINE TWENTY EIGHT WOULD TRANSFORM THE TRANSFER PROCESS THREE THREE SIGNIFICANT STUDENT CENTERED PROVISIONS. FIRST THE BILL WILL CREATE AN INTER SEGMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE A PERMANENT VENUE TO FACILITATE INTER SEGMENTAL COORDINATION AND GREATER STATE LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER AND TO FOCUS ON IMPROVING TRANSFER OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS. SECOND AS AMENDED THE BILL WOULD SET A TARGET DATE FOR THE INTERSEGMENT ALL COMMITTEE OF ACADEMIC SENATES. TO ESTABLISH A SINGULAR LOWER DIVISION GENERAL EDUCATION PATHWAY THAT MEANS TRANSFERRED MISSION TO CSU AND UC. GOING FROM TWO GENERAL EDUCATION PATHWAYS TO ONE MAKES IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO APPLY TO BOTH CSU AND UC. AND KEEP THEIR OPTIONS OPEN. THIRD THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO DECLARE A GOAL OF TRANSFERRED TO BE PLACED ON AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER OR AT T. PATHWAY. WHERE ONE EXISTS FOR THEIR MAJOR SINCE THE AT T. GUARANTEES ADMISSION TO THE CSU SYSTEM AT PARTICIPATING PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THIS PROVISION WILL INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A STUDENT WILL TRANSFER AND COMPLETE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF IN AT T. DOES NOT EXIST IN THE STUDENTS CHOSEN MAJOR THEN THERE IS NO AT T. FOR THE STUDENT TO BE PLACED ON. IMPORTANTLY STUDENTS CAN OPT OUT IN OUR POWER TO CHOOSE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. ALSO NOTHING IN THIS BILL PROHIBITS A STUDENT FROM BEING ON THE AT T. PATHWAY AND ALSO APPLYING TO TRANSFER TO A UC OR PRIVATE INSTITUTION. THE TROUBLING REALITIES OF THE STATUS QUO IS FAILING OUR STUDENTS. ONLY 20% OF STUDENTS WITH THE TRANSFER GOAL SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFER WITHIN SIX YEARS. THIS IS SHOCKING AND UNACCEPTABLE STUDENTS DESERVE BETTER AND CALIFORNIA CAN DO BETTER. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE- AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE- IN TESTIFYING IN PERSON. MICHELLE SECURUS PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY. AND TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE SO YOU'RE CHRISTIAN CHANCELLOR OF THE CURRENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE IN PERSON PLEASE PROCEDURE OF TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR LEYVA GOOD MORNING SENATORS THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON MICHELLE C. K. DOES PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY. A STATEWIDE POLICY RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION OUR FOCUS IS ALWAYS TO ENSURE GREATER OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS AND SUCCESS FOR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO CLOSE THE RACIAL EQUITY GAPS THAT PERSIST IN HIGHER EDUCATION. I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU AS THE DAUGHTER OF A SEAMSTRESS WHO ONLY AD A SIXTH GRADE EDUCATION. IT WAS PETS ARE COLLEGE AND UCLA AND CAL GRANTS THAT ALLOWED MY DREAMS TO BECOME A REALITY. AND FOR A LT OF LOW INCOME FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS THAT IS ALSO THE CASE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE THE PATHWAY IN OUR STATE FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY. ONE MORE THAN 70% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS INDICATE THAT THEY INTEND TO TRANSFER. UNFORTUNATELY TRANSFER IS INCREDIBLY BROKEN IN CALIFORNIA AFTER TWO YEARS ONLY TWO AND A HALF PERCENT ACTUALLY DO. I WANT TO REPEAT THAT ONLY TWO AND A HALF PERCENT TRANSFER AFTER TWO YEARS. TO BUILD UPON ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN'S REMARKS HIGHLIGHTING THE TROUBLING TRANSFER RATES. THE DATA IS EVEN WORSE FOR BLACK AND WHITE NEXT STUDENTS. DESPITE HAVING SIMILAR RATES OF DECLARING TRANSFER AS A GOAL. ONLY 9% OF BLACK STUDENTS ONLY SUPPORTED TO TRANSFER AFTER FOUR YEARS. THIS IS COMPARED TO SEVENTEEN AND 27% OF THEIR WHITE AND ASIAN AMERICAN PEERS RESPECTIVELY WHICH IS ALSO UNACCEPTABLE. AB NINE TWO EIGHT DRAWS INTENTIONAL STATEWIDE FOCUS TO STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S TRANSFER PROCESS. BUILDING ON TEN YEARS OF THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. A HISTORIC PROVISION OF THIS BILL IS TO CREATE A SINGULAR G. PATHWAY INTO THE UC AND THE CSU FOR STUDENTS THIS IS TRULY A GAME CHANGER. THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION ENVISIONED THAT WE WOULD HAVE A SEAMLESS TRANSFER PATHWAY WHEN IN FACT WE STILL DON'T. THE HARSH REALITY IS THAT PROSPECTIVE STROKE TRANSFER STUDENTS HAVE TO NAVIGATE ADDITIONAL HURDLES THAT THEIR PEERS FROM HIGH SCHOOL DIDN'T HAVE TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS COMPLETE THE EIGHT THREE G. COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND THEY CAN APPLY TO BOTH THE UC AND THE CSU. THEY DON'T NEED TO NAVIGATE DIFFERENT HURDLES IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ADMISSIONS. BY REQUIRING THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO SEEK TO APPLY FOR TRANSFER TO BOTH THE CSU AND UC COMPLETE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT G. E. PATTERNS. IT'S AT BEST INEFFECTIVE COSTLY FOR STUDENTS AND FOR THE STATE. AT WORST IT'S DISCRIMINATORY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. IN TWENTY TEN THIS BODY MADE HISTORY LED BY THEN STATE SENATOR ALEX PADILLA ON TRANSFER REFORM. TODAY WHILE THE OPPOSITION CLAIMS THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WRONG I THINK THOSE STATISTICS BEG TO DIFFER. THEY MAY PREFER THAT YOU DO NOTHING BUT YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE HISTORY AND FINALLY FIXED TRANSFER ONCE AND FOR ALL. LET'S MAKE EQUITY IN HIGHER ED MORE THAN JUST A SLOGAN THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NEXT WITNESS ARE YOU ONLY HAVE A MINUTE LEFT BECAUSE AT FIRST WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO YOUR TIME. SO PLEASE PROCEED TO HAVE A MINUTE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR LEYVA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENT YOUR QUESTION FOURTEEN DAYS IN MY NEW JOB.

SENATE GOAL FOURTEEN FORTY WITH A POWERFUL LEGISLATIVE TOOL THAT REQUIRED CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO OFFER AND SHE IS USED TO ACCEPTED STUDENTS WITH AT T. A- STATUS. BUT THERE IS STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE THERE ARE TROUBLING INEQUITIES THAT REMAIN PARTICULARLY AMONG OUR BLACK STUDENTS INCLUDING THROUGH THE AT T. PARKWAY TO THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE. IN AB. NINE TWENTY EIGHT. SENATOR BYRD BENNETT SPOKE ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THE KEY. LET ME ANSWER THE LAST PIECE WHICH IS A COMMUNITY TO. SHOULD BE GIVEN THE T.

CALIFORNIA SEVENTY THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. WE ALONG WITH OUR FACULTY COLLEGES ADOPTED AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION REGARDING THE BILL SH FIRST WE GREW THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSOR OF THAT. THAT CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD DO A BETTER JOB AGREED TO TRANSFER RATE THE CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS DECLARE THE COLOR. LOW INCOME WORKERS THEIR FAMILY TO ATTEND COLLEGE. LOCKED OUT OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE DO SUPPORT THE I OF A CAN INCRIMINATING HIGHER EDUCATION PROFESSIONAL TO BE OUR TO TAKE A HARD ON HOW WE'RE DOING. TRANSFER IMMIGRANT DILIGENCE ON HOW WE CAN. MAKE THE PROCESS BETTER PURSUIT. WE DO ASK THAT AN APPOINTEE FROM THE CALIFORNIA INTERSEGMENT ARTICULATION CAMP WILL BE ADDED TO THE COMMITTEE. THAT THEY ARE CRITICAL TO THE PROCESS. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ON THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES REGARDING THE MANDATE. CONTAINED IN THE BILL. ONLY DIFFERENCE WE THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE AMENDED OUT AND ADDED A CRITICAL TOPIC FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. FOR EXAMPLE WE THINK THAT BEING AUTOMATICALLY PLACED INTO NEEDED HE WILL NOT WORK PLACE FROM. DO NOT HAVE AN EASY OPPORTUNITY YOU OR A LOCAL CAMPUS IS IMPACTED. ADDITIONALLY AUTOMATICALLY PLACING A STUDENT INTO NEEDY TEAM REGARDLESS OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL GO DIRECTLY AGAINST THE GUIDED APTLY INITIATIVE BUT OUR SYSTEM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. I'M MORE CONCERNED ONLY MANDATE THAT MAKES TURN OVER TO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ACT AND THE- PROFESSOR JEANETTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU THANK YOU RUN. AND DIDN'T. CHAROLAIS MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE AND- I AM JENNY MAY VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. REPRESENTING THE FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY AND CURRICULAR AND ACADEMIC MATTERS. WE UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT OR REQUIRING A SINGULAR GENERAL EDUCATION PATHWAY. HOWEVER WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE CSU SYSTEM WOULD HAVE TO ADOPT THE UC GENERAL EDUCATION TRANSFER STANDARDS. DUE TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMY OF THE UC SYSTEM. YOU SEE EXCEPT PARK YOUR COURSE THEM YES YOU COULD TRANSFER FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THIS IS TRUE FOR G. COURSES AS WELL. A SINGULAR GENE PATHWAY WILL LIKELY ELIMINATE CURRENT SUCCESSFUL AND BENEFICIAL OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS. CREATING NEW BARRIERS TO G. E. PATHWAY COMPLETION. IN GENERAL INTRODUCTORY COURSES DO NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR YOU THINK BUT THEY DO ME J. E. REQUIREMENTS FOR CSU. SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY. AND MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY. SCHOOL TEACHERS AND THERE ARE MANY MORE. THE REASONS WE- THAT THE- IN A MENTAL COMMITTEE BE REQUIRED TO. US G. POP. I'M PROPOSED THE G. PALCO THAT BE A- AND CAREER GOALS ALL.

I CAME HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO SPEAK ON THIS IS VERY GOOD AND- I TELL YOU I IF- IF I DIDN'T NEED MY BLOOD PRESSURE GALLON. THIS TO BE THE PLACE TO GO TO GET A GALLON AND LISTENING TO THIS DISCUSSION THUS FAR. YEAH I HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY MANY YEARS I SAID AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AT T. PROCESS. AND WE BECAME SO FRUSTRATED WITH THE YEARS THAT HAD GONE BY. WITHOUT MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IN THAT TRANSFER TRACK THAT WE- REQUIRE THAT EVERY MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES WE NEEDED A REPORT AN UPDATE. BECAUSE WE WERE WE WERE SAYING THAT THERE WAS NO PROGRESS BEING MADE IN THIS SPACE AND WE ALL RECOGNIZE. HOW CONSEQUENTIAL THIS IS TO SO MANY STUDENTS. THAT THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING. IN IN THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASS. AND THEN REALIZING THAT ALL THOSE UNITS AND ALL THAT TIME. AND GRANTED ANY KIND OF LEARNING IS A HEALTHY THING IN A WONDERFUL THING. BUT ALL THAT TIME. CAME ZERO. WHEN IT CAME TO GETTING. PROGRESS TO DEGREE. AND THEN THIS IS IT AN INCREDIBLE FAILURE THAT I SAW. BACK IN THE AND IT FRUSTRATED THE HECK OUT OF US. AND WE ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THE FACULTY. WERE NOT ENGAGING AND CERTIFYING THESE COURSES. ARE THESE DAYS IS- BRAIN SURGERY WERE TRYING TO CERTIFY THESE COURSES NO FOLKS. THESE ARE INTRODUCTORY COURSES THESE ARE THE MOST BASIC COURSES. IN OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN ANY SUBJECT AREA. WHETHER IT'S ENGLISH OR MATH OR LANGUAGE. THIS WAS IN A COMPLICATED THING. AND I THINK THAT OUR FACULTY. IN ALL OF THESE. SEGMENTS WERE NOT ABLE TO GET TOGETHER AND FIGURE THIS THING OUT. WHEN WE WERE SEEN TRAIN WRECKS HAPPENING EVERY YEAR. WITH THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. DOING THE WRONG THING. FROM AN INSTITUTION THAT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP THEM DO THE RIGHT THING. AND GET THEM ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AND SO WE GET TO WATCH EVERY YEAR THAT TRAIN CRASH HAPPENING. WE LOVE OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THEY ARE THE MOST INCREDIBLE JEWELS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE THAT EVERY LEVEL. AND WE HAVE SOME OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE LEADING THOSE INSTITUTIONS. GREAT PRESIDENT GREAT FACULTY AND GET TO SEE THIS TYPE OF A BREAKDOWN. IT'S STUNNING. AND HAVE A BILL THAT'S PERFECT FOR US TODAY. THE TRIED TO CONTINUE TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM IS STUNNING. IT IS A COMPLETE FAILURE. OF OUR WONDERFUL INSTITUTIONS TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. AT ITS CRAZY IS THE BUREAUCRACY FAILING US. CAN WE TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW GREATER INSTITUTIONS ARE ACCESSIBILITY LOW COST QUALITY. BUT COMPLETION MY FRIENDS. COMPLETION IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THAT STUDENTS ARE TAKING THE RIGHT COURSES THAT THEY'RE GETTING THEIR DEGREE IT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT A LOT OF KIDS GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR OTHER REASONS GOOD REASONS. IT THERE TRY TO GET PROGRESS 2 DEGREES WE ARE FAILING. WE ARE FAILING. AND I SAY TO MY FRIENDS IN THE FACULTY. WE HAVE PLEADED WITH YOU. PLEASE COMMUNICATE COOPERATE WORK IT OUT CREATE THE PATHWAYS THESE ARE INTRODUCTORY COURSES. N. Y. INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE OR BIOLOGY IS NOT THE TRACK TO GET TO UC OR CSU COME ALIVE SO NOW THEY'VE HAD TEN YEARS. AND E HAVE A IT'S A PROBLEM AND WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER TEN. ASSEMBLY MENU OUR COURSE RIGHT. AND I APPLAUD YOUR DEDICATION AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE. AND IT'S FRUSTRATES THE HECK OUT OF ME TO SEE A BILL LIKE THIS AND TO SEE THE OPPOSITION. STILL THERE. FORCES THEM TO DO THAT'S NOT ENOUGH REPRESENTATION HERE. COME ON FOLKS WE ARE FAILING OUR KIDS AND WE CANNOT BE PATIENT IN THE SPACE WE CANNOT. AND SO TODAY I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. I HOPE THAT THE FACULTY ARE WONDERFUL FACULTY CAN REALIZE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT THE STUDENTS WE KNOW THEY CARE WILL STEP UP AND GET THIS THING DONE CREATE THOSE PATHWAYS ELIMINATE THIS MISCOMMUNICATION. MAKE SURE WE'RE HELPING OUR KIDS SIXTY NOT JUST IN YOUR CLASSROOM. BUT IN THE EDUCATION BUREAUCRACY WHICH THIS BILL TRIES TO OVERCOME ONCE AGAIN. HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL SIR.

THAT WE'VE HAD IN IN DISCUSSING THIS BILL AND FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT THIS BILL OF CLOUT HERE TODAY. SO AS A ALL OF YOU I BELIEVE NO. V. CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGE BOARD OF GOVERNORS- TOOK A HISTORIC VOTE. ON MONDAY TO ADOPT- THE ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENT FOR THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE THAT WE- ARE SEEKING AN IN THIS BILL A. B. TEN FORTY. AND SO- LAST NIGHT I CALLED. THE LOS SENSES COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICT CHANCELLOR FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ THAT- YOU'LL BE HEARING- AS ONE OF THE SUPPORTING WITNESSES WHETHER HE WANTED TO PROCEED WITH THIS BILL. AND HE MADE A POINT THAT I. COMPLETELY AGREED WITH AND- WAS THE REASON WHY I WANTED TO I JOIN HIM AND REQUESTING THAT WE BE ALLOWED TO PRESENT THIS BILL NOT WITHSTANDING THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS VOTE WHICH IS THAT. THIS MORNING THIS COMMITTEE HEARD AB ONE ON ONE. TO ESTABLISH THE EPIC SAYS REQUIREMENT FOR OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. LAST YEAR WE HAD AB FOURTEEN SIXTY THAT ESTABLISHED THE REQUIREMENT. FOR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. WHY NOT FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WHY WHY WHY DOESN'T TAKE AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE ITS OWN LAW THAT REQUIRES AN ATTIC STATUS REQUIREMENT FOR THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE. YES IT'S A SYSTEM OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. WE KNOW THAT IT OUT LAWS. HAVE A STRONGER. AND GOOD AND THEN REGULATIONS AND SO THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE IS OPPORTUNITY TO PASS AN ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENT FOR OUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE AS HIS FOREIGN ASSOCIATE DEGREE TO DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT NOT ONLY TO THE PRINCIPAL AND THE REQUIREMENT OF AN ETHICS IS REQUIREMENT BUT ALSO TO DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE FUNDING. TO- TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS A SUCCESS AND IT'S ALSO- THIS BILL IS CRITICAL AND IT GOES BEYOND WHAT THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS VOTED ON ON MONDAY. AND THAT. THIS WOULD REQUIRE V. V. THE FACILITATION OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ETHICS STUDIES COURSES TO BE ACCEPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES. RIGHT NOW- YOU DON'T CENTER GLAZER WE JUST GAVE ELOQUENT SPEECH ABOUT HOW BUREAUCRACIES CAN UNDERMINE A PROXIES- DRAG THINGS OUT AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT IN ORDER TO WORK FROM ONE SILO TO ANOTHER THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE. THAT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE ETHICS STUDIES COURSES WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND IT WILL SET FORTH. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CROSS. THOSE THOSE SILOS IN THIS CASE THE COMMUNICABLE SYSTEM AND OUR AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM- TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL HAVE A SEAMLESS TRANSFER- IN IN TERMS OF ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES FROM OUR COMMUNICATORS TO FULFILL THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY AT THE EXTRAS REQUIREMENT. HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL- TO SPEAKER AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE PASSIONATELY IN SUPPORT OF AB TEN FORTY IS THE LOSS AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT CHANCELLOR FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ. WHO'S A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AS WELL AS WE HAD TO CHANGE AND NOW- WITNESSES- MADAM CHAIR- TUDYK ZINE A STUDENT AT UC DAVIS FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT AND MEMBER OF THE STUDENT SENATE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATIONS IS TERRIFIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALL RIGHTWE'RE GOING TO START WITH CHANCELLOR RODRIGUEZ YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. AND THEN WE WILL GO TO RECONVENE AND YOU WALK TWO MINUTES AS WELL CHANCELLOR PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU- CHAIR LEYVA AUDIBLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF A GOOD MORNING FRANCISCO THE GUESTS ON THIS I SERVICE CHANCE FOR THE LOS ANGELES COMMITTEE COLORS DISTRICT AND I'M VERY HONORED. TO JOIN YOU THIS MORNING ALONG WITH SOME AMEND. MURATSUCHI REPRESENTING L. A. C. CITY IN THE AS THE PROUD SPONSOR OF AB TEN FORTY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL ISSUE. OF ETHNIC STUDIES IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES SELECTED EVERYDAY WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL SHOULD BECOME LAW FOLLOWED BY SOME BRIEF POINTS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF ETHNIC STUDIES. THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE ANALYSIS QUESTIONS THE NEED FOR THIS BILL FOLLOWING THE RECENT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD OF GOVERNORS VOTE AND THE APPROVAL OF TOTAL FIVE REGULATIONS AND INCLUDING THREE UNIT THAT THINKS THAT IS GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGE ASSOCIATES DEGREE I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT WHY THIS BILL IS STILL NECESSARY FIRST COSTA REIMBURSEMENT. THE LEGISLATURE'S PASSAGE AND GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY LAST YEAR DR WEBBER'S LANDMARK LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE SATISFACTORY COMPLETION OF A LOWER DIVISION. I THINK STUDIES COURSE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AT THE CSU ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO OFFER I THINK STUDIES FOR OUR STUDENTS. WHO PLAN TO TRANSFER TO A CSU THIS BILL BOTH COMPLIMENTS AND CONFORMS TO THE REQUIREMENTS. OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER POINTED OUT AB TEN FORTY WILL ALSO ENSURE THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES. WHICH ALREADY THE MOST UNDER FUNDED. EDUCATION SYSTEM WILL PROBABLY WILL PROBABLY BE REIMBURSED FOR THIS NEW REQUIREMENT. ARTICLE THIRTEEN B. SECTION SIX OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THAT WHENEVER THE STATE MANDATES A NEW PROGRAMMER HIGHER LEVELS SERVICE. BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IT QUOTE STATE SHALL PROVIDE FUNDING TO REIMBURSE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE COST OF THE PROGRAM OR INCREASED LEVELS SERVICE. I'M THEREFORE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OFFERING NOTHING STUDIES COURSES AND ANY OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLYING WITH A. B. TEN FORTY COULD BE SUBJECT. TO REIMBURSEMENT. BY THE STATE IN CONTRAST TOTAL FIVE REGULATIONS IN. SIMILAR REQUIRE COULD NOT IN. COMMITTEE COLLEGES TO ANY OF. APPROPRIATION FROM THE STATE GENERAL.
