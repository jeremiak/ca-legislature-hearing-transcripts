THIRTY BY -- THIS QUIRK SILVA ITEM NUMBER THREE SB -- NINE ONE SIX THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE OMNIBUS BILL ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN I ASKED YOU ARE NINETEEN BY MISTER WILK. THE MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN PULLED OUR ITEM NUMBER FOUR SP EIGHT NINE TWO AND ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SP. ELEVEN OH FOR MISTER ROTH AT LEAST SIX BILLS TO BE HEARD. WE'LL TAKE TESTIMONY FROM TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON EACH MEASURE THAT'S TO INTO. I EACH WITNESS WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES. AGAIN IT'S ONLY TWO MINUTES NO LONGER THAN THAT ALL OTHERS MAY LINE UP AND STATE THEIR AYE NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL'S. WITH THAT I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE AN AUTHOR MY SENATOR HILL IS PRESENT. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY A CENTER HELL IS GOING TO BE PRESENTING -- FILE ITEM. NINE S. BICU ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY COOL [inaudible] EDUCATION. OUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN. TO COME ON CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER MEDICAL CANNABIS TO THEM IN NON SMOKING AND NON BABY INFORMED. MANY OF THE STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE A DOSE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS AT REGULAR INTERVALS. WHICH OFTEN INCLUDES DURING SCHOOL HOURS. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ANY FORM OF CANNABIS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS THE STUDENTS MUST BE PICKED UP BY THEIR PARENTS. AND TAKEN OFF CAMPUS IN ORDER TO TAKE THEIR MEDICINE. IN FACT I BELIEVE IT'S ONE THOUSAND FEET AWAY FROM CAMPUS. THIS IS VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THEIR LEARNING S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNING BOARD OF A K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION OR A CHARTER SCHOOL TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO ADOPT THIS POLICY. IT IS NOT A STATE MANDATE. DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES THAT OPT IN CAN OPT OUT FOR ANY REASON. INCLUDING THE FEDERAL FUNDING IS PUT AT RISK AS A RESULT OF THIS POLICY IS BETWEEN. ONE ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN REQUIRES A STUDENT TO BE QUALIFIED. MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT WITH A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION TYPICALLY THE MEDICINE IS THAT BEEN ADMINISTERED AS OIL CAPSULES TEACHERS LIQUIDS OR TOPICAL CREAMS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT A PARENT MUST GIVE THE SCHOOL A COPY OF THEIR CHILD'S MEDICAL CANNABIS RECOMMENDATION TO KEEP ON FILE. SIGN IN WHEN THEY COME ON CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER THE MEDICINE NOT DISRUPT THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. TAKE ALL CANNABIS FROM SCHOOL GROUNDS AFTER ADMINISTRATION EXISTING LAW ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO LEGALLY ADMINISTER ANY PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG. INCLUDING OPIOIDS THAT A CHILD HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED. BUT THERE ARE NO MEDICAL CONDITIONS PHARMACEUTICALS CAN'T FIX. AND THEY OFTEN HAVE DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS MEDICAL CANNABIS HELPS FILL SOME OF THESE GAPS AND LESS IN THESE CHALLENGING SIDE EFFECTS. PARENTS ACROSS THE NATION HAVE HAD SUCCESS TREATING THEIR CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL CANNABIS WHEN NO PHARMACEUTICAL WOULD WORK. WASHINGTON COLORADO FLORIDA MAINE AND NEW JERSEY HAVE ALL PASSED LEGISLATION ALLOWING STUDENTS TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES I RESPECTFULLY ASK ARRIVAL. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I HAVE A WISH CONSERVE OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU YOUR WITNESS IN SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEED. MY NAME IS GREG GARCIA AND I AM HERE TO SPLIT THE SUPPORT JUDGE SHOWS ACT SB. ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN MY SON IS STILL RUNNING JO JO HUMANISTS HE HAS USED CANNABIS IN A FOUR MONTHS OF TEACHERS CPBL TEACH THE FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS. HE HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH EPILEPSY SINCE THE AGE OF THREE MONTHS OLD. HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LENNOX CUSTO SYNDROME IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THIS KINDA EPILEPSY IS VERY VERY HARD TO CONTROL. HE WAS MEDICATED WITH VERY HIGH DOSES OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND ALSO FIT IT WITH THE VAGUS NERVE STIMULATOR. ALL WITH NO SUCCESS. I WAS WATCHING MY SON DIE RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES. I NEW THERE HAD TO BE A BETTER WAY. I BEGAN RESEARCHING CANNABIS AND AFFECTS OF IT TO TREAT EPILEPSY. AND CHOSE TO TRY IT AS OUR LAST RESORT. IT SEEMED VERY HOPEFUL FROM THE VERY START. FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE TRIED. AND DAY BY DAY I SEEN HIM EMERGE FROM IS MEDICAID IT'S THE IN FIGHTING DJING AGAIN. CAESARS WERE DECREASED IMMEDIATELY. AYE SUPPORT THIS BILL TO TO THE FACT THAT JOE JOE NEEDS A DOSE AT SCHOOL EVERY DAY AT TWELVE PM. I FEEL CANNABIS SHOULD BE TREATED AS EVERY OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ON CAMPUS IT IS NOT FAIR. THAT THIS MEDICINE HAS SAVED MY SON'S LIFE AND NOT BE GIVEN THE SAME TREATMENT. AND ABILITY AS OTHER PHARMACEUTICALS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS BILL BECOMING LAW MY SON'S LIFE AND SO MANY OTHERS DEPEND ON IT. IN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS NO ONE HAS DIED FROM CANNABIS USE IT IS THE ONLY MEDICINE THAT CAN TREAT SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS ON SUCH A WIDE SPECTRUM. FROM EPILEPSY TO ARTHRITIS TO CANCER TO PARKINSON'S. IT IS ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO REGENERATE BRAIN CELLS I HAVE SEEN THIS FIRSTHAND WITH MY CHILD. I ASK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART TO GIVE A YES VOTE TODAY AND BE THE VOICE OF MY SON AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT NEED. YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR COMPASSION. THANK YOU.

WE DO IT AN ACCORD HAS BEEN A SALAS THANK YOU OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ERICA HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. AYE WE DO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE WE SEE THIS AS WELL A LOCAL DECISION. AND ABILITY FOR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION TO SEE IF IT'S AN APPROPRIATE ACTION FOR THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT. THIS MEDICATION FOR LACK OF A DIFFERENT WORD -- DOES HELP TO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF CHILDREN WITH THE APPROPRIATE EDUCATION WITHOUT FEELING AS IF THEY'RE ON OPIOIDS AND OUT OF TOUCH WITH SOCIETY. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS DOES BECOME A LOCAL ISSUE AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THINKING. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CRISTINA MARCELLUS ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THE SCHOOL EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THIS CHAIR MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF CMG KHALIFA ONE OF THE LARGEST VERTICALLY INTEGRATED CANNABIS OPERATIONS IN THE STATE AND VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. UP OTHERS IN OPPOSITION ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY NO FURTHER OPPOSITION -- THANK YOU ARE YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- RETURN. I COMMITTEE CHAIRED I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE BILL THANK YOU GOD FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I I I JUST HAD A QUESTION. ARM FOR CONTACTS AND HOW OFTEN ARE THESE CONVERSATIONS NOW TAKING PLACE. IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HOW MANY STUDENTS FIND THEMSELVES WITH THE NEED TO HAVE ACCESS -- TO MEDICATION JUST BECAUSE IT. WHEN THE BILL CAME TO ME I HADN'T BEEN AWARE THAT WE WERE FORCING STUDENTS -- ACCESS MEDICATION OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL OR MAYBE IN WAYS THAT WOULD MAKE THEM UNSAFE. AND I ONE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF HOW SCHOOLS NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT -- OUR STUDENTS IN HOW COMMON ARE THESE NEEDS IF YOU HAVE ANY. SENSE OF THAT OR ANY OF THE WITNESSES HAVE ANY SENSE OF THAT. ON HOW OFFICE COMES UP. ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN I I DON'T HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF MORE THAN JUST IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. BUT I BELIEVE OBVIOUSLY IF WITH THE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE EMBRACED THIS AND I THINK IN OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. UP AROUND THE IMPACT TO DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT THERE ARE OTHERS BUT I DON'T KNOW OF ANY SPECIFIC CASES. BUT BEING OUR CATS -- CIRCLE THERE ARE A LOT OF CHILDREN THAT HAVE NEEDS THAT NEED TO TAKE MEDICATION AT SCHOOL WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. IS MOST PARENTS ARE TRYING TO SCHEDULE IT AROUND SCHOOL BUT IT'S NOT WORKING THEY'RE NOT ACHIEVING THE CONTROL THAT THEY NEED. BECAUSE ARE WITHHOLDING MEDICATION TIMES. SO THERE IS A GREATER NEED AND IF THEY'RE SAFE ACCESS I BELIEVE MORE PARENTS AND FAMILIES WILL BE MORE WILLING TO COME FORWARD. IMAGINE IF THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT A TRADING IN SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER POLICIES GET CREATED. ARE CONSISTENT DISTRICT TO DISTRICT TO NOT A LOT OF OF FOLKS CSPA HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT I MEAN I KNOW FOR EXAMPLE I WE HAVE EXAMPLE DOCTOR WEBER HAS INTRODUCED A BILL -- THAT HELPS OUR STUDENTS TO BE SAFE -- AND MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES IN SCHOOL AND THEIR OTHER SIMILAR BILLS WHERE THERE'S A STATE MANDATE BUT HOW IT GETS RULED OUT AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL SOME DISTRICTS DO WELL AND OTHERS. NOT SO WELL AND SO I'M INTERESTED WORK -- TO IMPLEMENT THIS INSTANTLY EVEN IF IT LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND WE'VE ACTUALLY SEE -- STARTED THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITHIN OUR OWN ORGANIZATION OF WHAT THIS POTENTIALLY LOOKS LIKE WITH LEGAL COUNSEL WITH OTHERS -- WE WILL IF THIS DOES BECOME LAW WE WILL PUT TOGETHER A SET OF DRAFT POLICIES WHICH IS THEN SENT OUT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THIS WITHIN THE STATE. MOST DISTRICTS MIGHT MAKE A WORD CHANGER TO BUT FOR THE MOST PART A LOT OF THEM TO ADOPT WITH THE DRAFT POLICY IS. SO THERE WOULD HOPEFULLY PROVIDE SOME CONSISTENCY I WILL ALSO RELATE THIS CONVERSATION BACK TO OUR POLICY DEVELOPMENT STAFF. SAID THERE WHERE OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE. IF KNOW THAT'S COMMON LANGUAGE THAT EVERYBODY CAN UNDERSTAND. AND THAT IT GETS TO THE ISSUE OF MAKING SURE THE KIDS ARE SAFE -- AND THAT PARENTS HAVE ACCESS BUT THAT THE SCHOOL SITE IS ALSO. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU IF I COULD POINT OUT MISTER CHAIR IS THAT THIS IS NOT A MANDATE SO THIS THE GRAPHICS THAT SHOW SO CHOOSE YOUR DESIRE TO DO IT CAN DO IT IN THOSE. MAY FIND IT AWKWARD OR UNCOMFORTABLE ONE LEFT RIGHT AND AND ALSO TO MISTER TERENCE QUESTION ABOUT YOU HOW AND HOW OFTEN AS IS HAPPENING -- I JUST MAKE TWO POINTS OF MY I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT THIS FOR NUMBER YEAR SOME SHIRTS HAPPENING TO OTHERS HERE. AND IN OUR STATE POSSIBLE IN FORWARD I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE DRUG THAT'S COMING OUT IN THE OVER THE NEXT YEAR THAT SPEAKS TO MAYBE EVEN THIS EXACT SITUATION. THAT'S CANNABINOID BASED AS I UNDERSTAND IT SO IT'S IT'S GOING BACK BUT IT'S ALSO GOING FORWARD. WHEN THINGS HAVE MEDICINAL VALUE WE WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THEM? SO WITH THAT ID FOR THE COMMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE DO DO WE HAVE A MOTION I'M OF THE BILL. BUT THE MOVE IS SECONDED YOU WISH TO CLOSE REFRESH MY BUT MEMBERS [inaudible] THANK YOU -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS -- DO PASSED YOU JUST YOUR AVERAGE THIS YEAR. O'DONNELL AYE AYE.

TEN THIRTY SIX WHICH WILL CLARIFY PROCEDURES FOR THE RELEASE OF A STUDENT'S DIRECTORY INFORMATION AND SCHOOL BOARD. CHARTER SCHOOL BOARD AND COUNTY BOARD -- BOARDS OF EDUCATION MEETING MINUTES I AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN S. STAFF FOR ALL THE HARD WORK IT WILL BE TAKING ALL THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. THAT WERE SUBMITTED TO US. CURRENTLY FEDERAL LAW ALLOWS FOR THE RELEASE OF STUDENTS DIRECTORS INFORMATION. IN THE PUBLIC -- UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES TYPICALLY CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE CHOSEN. TO NOT RELEASE THIS INFORMATION BUT THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES WHERE INFORMATION IS BEEN RELEASED TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE STUDENT AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS RELEASE OF INFORMATION HAS BEEN HAS LED TO TROUBLING ISSUES AT OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES PRIMARILY THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION OR POTENTIAL THERE OF CAN HAVE THE EFFECT OF SUPPRESSING PURCHASE A PITY PATIENT AND DISSENT. FOR INSTANCE ON CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES BEFORE THE BOARD SOME STUDENTS PARENTS GUARDIANS ARE RELATIVES FEEL THAT. THE RELEASE OF THEIR HOME ADDRESS PRESENTS POTENTIAL FOR HARM OR OTHER HARASSMENT BASED UPON THEIR TESTIMONY DURING THE MEETING. I THIS IS BROUGHT TO BE FROM A FROM A CONSTITUENT AFRICAN AMERICAN GRANDMOTHER WHO WHILE READING A BOOK THIS ACTUALLY PROVE BY THAT PART IN EDUCATION FIFTH GRADE BOOK. FOUND IT OFFENSIVE WENT TO THE SCHOOL BOARD MEETING VERY CONTENTIOUS -- A SITUATION. AND I FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THE BOARD RICH WOULD DIRECT IT REJECTED HER APPEAL. THEY WENT BACK THE NEXT BOARD MAYBE SEE WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY'RE REALLY THROUGH THE MINUTES AND HER NAME IN A IN A DRESS AND EVERYTHING IS IN THERE AND I THINK. DURING THESE TIMES I I I DON'T I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. SO SUIT SO SITUATIONS LIKE THIS HAVE LED TO THE PERCEPTION THAT THE RELEASE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY. BE EMPLOYED IN A MANNER LEADING TO INTIMIDATION IN RESPONSE AND FAVORABLE TESTIMONY FROM MEMBERS. SCHOOL COMMUNITY SO THIS. S. B. TEN THIRTY SIX WILL HELP PREVENT THAT.

MEDIA LITERACY AND THE SAFE USE OF TECHNOLOGY. I AM ACCEPTING HIS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THE AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH I BELIEVE ARE -- BOTH CLARIFYING AND TECHNICAL IN NATURE. SO THIS IS A WORLD WHERE WHEN I FIRST -- THE CAME TO THIS -- BODY BACK LITTLE WHILE AGO. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP MEDIA LITERACY OR THE SAFE USE OF TECHNOLOGY WOULD ENTAIL. WE KNOW TODAY THOUGH THE TEENAGERS SPANNED AB AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY HOURS A WEEK ONLINE. FIFTY HOURS A WEEK AND MY PARENTS USED TO COMPLAIN WHEN I'D SPEND FIVE HOURS A WEEK ON THE PHONE. BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD. THE NUMBER FOR TWEENS IS EVEN HIGHER. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO COMPREHENSIVE STANDARDS FOR TEACHING STUDENTS ABOUT THE MORE CRITICAL ASPECTS OF DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP THINGS LIKE. SEXTING CYBERBULLYING PRIVACY AND FAKE NEWS. EDUCATORS ARE FACED WITH THE OFTEN OVERWHELMING CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY TECHNOLOGY USAGE BY STUDENTS AND STUDENTS TO STRUGGLE TO MAKE SENSE. OF AN EVER CHANGING DIGITAL LANDSCAPE. S. B. NINE FORTY SEVEN WOULD ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY PANEL COMPRISED OF EDUCATION EXPERTS WORKING IN TANDEM WITH THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IS OFFICE. TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES AND STRATEGIES THAT SUPPORT SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS HOW DO WE DO WITH THESE VERY CRITICAL ISSUES.

OFTENTIMES OTHER STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THIS ACTIVITY DON'T HAVE ANY NOTION THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS PUSHING A YOUNG PERSON OVER THE EDGE. WE NEED TO DO BETTER TODAY THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD THAN THE WORLD THAT I GREW UP IN IN THE PERHAPS MANY OF YOU ALSO GREW UP IN AND WE NEED TO COME. TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES USING THE BEST PRACTICES ALLOWING OUR TEACHERS AND OTHERS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HEALTH WELL BEING EDUCATION. AND TRAINING OF OUR YOUTH TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE TOOLS TO ASSIST SO THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES WILL MINIMIZE THEIR ADVERSE IMPACTS ON OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.

WE MUST TEACH THEM TO BE GOOD SMART CAUTIOUS AN ETHICAL DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP CITIZENS AS WELL. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES AND IT ALSO ADDRESSES THE INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL FOR LEARNING THEIR IMPROVING OUR STUDENTS MEDIA LITERACY. AS OUR KIDS INCREASINGLY GO AND MARK GO ONLINE TO PULL STUDY AND ENTERTAIN THEMSELVES THIS LEGISLATION WOULD EMPOWER EDUCATORS. TO EQUIP STUDENTS WITH THE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS NECESSARY TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE IN READ ONLINE. QUESTIONS THAT COULD LEAD TO IMPROVED MEDIA LITERACY AS WELL. COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION IS EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR LEARNING THAT THE SPOKEN BRING TO ALL CALIFORNIA CITIZENS AND WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. YOUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

THE ABILITY TO ACCESS ANALYZE AND EVALUATE INFORMATION IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. FOR PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S WORLD. UNDERSTANDING THE PROPHET POWER DYNAMICS OF THE MEDIA ENVIRONMENT IS COMPLICATED AND REQUIRE STRONG CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS. SKILLS THAT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE. TO BECOME MEDIA LITERATE REQUIRES PRACTICE AND TRAINING NOT ONLY FOR STUDENTS BUT ALSO FOR TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS. MEDIA LITERACY LEGISLATION HAS PASSED OR IS CURRENTLY PENDING IN FOURTEEN STATES.
