IN THE AROMAS AFFIRMATIVE FINANCE THANK YOU SO MUCH ALL RIGHT SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE OVERVIEW WELCOME FACTOR THAT DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICESAUTHORITY THAT ALL REFER TO AS EMS AUTHORITY -- LET ME START WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR DEPARTMENT AND BUDGET AND THEN MOVED TO THE PENDING BUT EVERY CLASS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY RELEASED IN JANUARY THIS YEAR INCLUDES EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY IN THE AMOUNT OF THIRTY FOUR POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND SEVENTY SIX PERMANENT POSITIONS OF THIS 44% IS DELEGATED FOR STATE OPERATIONS. AND 56% IS DELEGATED TO LOCAL ASSISTANCE. ARIANNA SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. WITH THE INTENT OF CREATING A STATEWIDE EMS SYSTEM WITH THE MS AUTHORITY RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION OF ALL STATE ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE THE PROVISION OF EFFECTIVE AND OUR GOALIS TO ORGANIZE EMERGENCY CARE SYSTEMS WITHIN CALIFORNIA JUST TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY PATIENT CARE. MS AS A SMALL DEPARTMENT BUT WITHSIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITIES IN THREE CATEGORIES. FIRST PRE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY SERVICES WHICH IS ONE PIECE OF AN INTEGRATED EMERGENCY CARE NETWORK. THE PROVIDES ONE OF OUR MAJOR HEALTH CARE SAFETY NETS. HOSPITAL NINE ONE ONE SERVICES ARE WIDELY SEEN BY THE PUBLIC AS A GUARANTEED MEDICAL SERVICE REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE STATUS. IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE CURRENTLY SIXTY THREE THOUSAND CERTIFIED EMTS AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND LICENSE PARAMEDICS THE RESPOND TO MORE THAN FOUR MILLION NINE ONE ONE CALLS USING AIR AND GROUND AMBULANCES. SPECIFICALLY THE EMS AUTHORITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SCOPE OF PRACTICE TRAINING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS FOR EMT AND PARAMEDIC PRACTICE AS WELL AS PUBLIC SAFETY -- PERSONNEL. WE LICENSE PARAMEDICS AND DISCIPLINE THOSE LICENSES WHEN NECESSARY. WE ALSO OVERSEE FIRST AID TRAINING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS THAT INCLUDE -- FOR THE PUBLIC -- AS WELL AS PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL THAT INCLUDE TACTICAL MEDICAL CARE AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS EPINEPHRINE FOR ALLERGIC REACTIONS NALOXONE FOR NARCOTIC OVERDOSE AND CARDIO PULMONARY RESUSCITATION. ONE IMPORTANT INITIATIVE FROM THE MS AUTHORITY REGARDING THE ROLE OF PARAMEDICS IS AN APPROVED HEALTH WORKFORCE PILOT PROJECT. TO THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT TO TEST AND EVALUATE THE USED TO PICK OF PARAMEDICS. AND EXPANDED MOBILE HEALTH CARE ROLES TO FILL SOME OF THE GAPS IN OUR LOCAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IMPROVE ACCESS. TO CARE AND INTEGRATION CARE. SOME OF THESE PROJECTS BEING TESTED INCLUDE USE OF PARAMEDICS FOR POST -- HOSPITAL DISCHARGE SHORT TERM FOLLOW UP TO PREVENT READMISSION ENGAGING IN LINKING NINE ONE ONE OR MERGING SEE FREQUENT USERS TO SOCIAL ANOTHER HEALTH SERVICES TO BETTER MEET THEIR NEEDS. SCREENING PATIENTS WITH MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS OR ALCOHOL INTOXICATION AND TRANSPORTING THOSE WITHOUT A CUTE MEDICAL PROBLEMS DIRECTLY TO A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS CENTER OR TO A SOBERING CENTER RATHER THAN TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. AND WORKING WITH HOSPICE NURSES TO PER DEPARTMENT VISITS AT THE END OF LIFE. THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN ROLLED WELL OVER FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS WITH NO ADVERSE IMPACT. AND OF SHOWN DEMONSTRABLE BENEFIT ACCORDING TO OUR INDEPENDENT EVALUATOR. SECONDLY THE MS AUTHORITY DEVELOPS GUIDELINES AND APPROVES PLANS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED AND OPERATED BY -- THIRTY THREE LOCAL EMS AGENCIES. THAT ARE COMPRISED OF TWENTY SIX SINGLE COUNTY AGENCIES IN SEVEN RURAL MULTI COUNTY AGENCIES. DIRECT NINE ONE ONE AMBULANCE SERVICES PROVIDED BY A MIXTURE OF PUBLIC FIRE AGENCIES AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS. IN THIS OVERSIGHT ROLE THE EMS AUTHORITY -- ALSO DEVELOPS REGULATIONS FOR DESIGN AND QUALITY OF THE-SPECIALTY CARE SYSTEMS THAT INCLUDE THE TRAUMA SYSTEM. PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE CENTERS STROKES CENTERS CARDIAC CENTERS AND POINT THE POISON CONTROL CENTER. THE ACTUAL FACILITIES ARE DESIGNATED BY THE LOCAL EMS AGENCIES. ONE OF OUR PRIORITY INITIATIVES IS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EMS SYSTEM USING LOCAL AND REGIONAL DATA. WE ALSO HAVE A GRANT FROM THE CENTERS -- FOR MEDICAID AND AND MEDICARE SERVICES TO DEVELOP HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE BETWEEN EMS AND HOSPITALS. SO THE PARAMEDICS IN THE FIELD CAN RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM THE PATIENT'S ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. AND THE PRE HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS BECOME PART OF THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. THIS ALSO IMPROVES CARE DURING THE DISASTER. BY MAKING CRITICAL PATIENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE WHEN PATIENTS ARE TREATED IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS OUTSIDE THEIR USUAL HEALTH SYSTEM. OUR THIRD MAJOR AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY IS TO COORDINATE THE MEDICAL RESPONSE TO DISASTER. IN COOPERATION WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND FOR THIS WE PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO BUILD A PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESPONSE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ANY TYPE OF DISASTER. WE SUPPORTED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THE PAST YEAR WITH OUR DISASTER FIELD RESOURCES. TO EVACUATE PATIENTS FROM PATH OF WHILE AND TO MOBILIZE OUR DISASTER HEALTH CARE VOLUNTEER NETWORK TO SUPPORT PATIENT CARE. FOR THE CAMPFIRE IN BUTTE COUNTY WE MOBILIZED -- RESOURCES THAT INCLUDED FIVE AMBULANCE STRIKE TEAMS EACH OF WHICH HAS FIVE AMBULANCES PASTA -- WE'D VEHICLE. AND PROVIDED CARE FOR THE SHELTER POPULATION -- BY COORDINATING MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS FROM OUR CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TEAMS DISASTER HEALTHCARE VOLUNTEERS. CALIFORNIA ERIN ARMY NATIONAL GUARD AND NATIONAL DISASTER MEDICAL SYSTEM TASK FORCE MEMBERS. WE ALSO MOBILIZED MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED VETERINARY VOLUNTEERS AND SET UP AND MANAGE TWENTY EIGHT MOBILE MEDICAL SHELTER STRUCTURES FOR PATIENT ISEL FOR PATIENTS ISOLATIONS -- I'LL STOP THERE IN TERMS THE OVERVIEW ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS RELATED TO OUR USUAL SERVICES AND AUTHORITIES. THANK YOU THANKS RIGHT JENNY COMMENTS FROM LA -- FINANCE QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS NOW. OKAY I JUST A BRIEF QUESTION JUST REGARDING -- SERVE YOUR OVERALL BUDGETS -- I MAKE NOTE THAT AND FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE REIMBURSEMENTS -- WAS BUDGET WE EXPECTED ABOUT SEVENTEEN MILLION IS UP. TO TWENTY OF SUCH ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION WERE PROPOSING DOWN THE FIFTEEN MILLION CAN YOU JUST PERHAPS ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT AS THAT. BUT I CAN SPECULATE AS TO WHY THAT CASE. YET YES WELL WHAT THE UP AND THEN THE DAY AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE A BUDGET IT DOWN AGAIN SO WHAT WAS A SPIKE UP -- WOULD RESULT OF THIS IS A THIS IS AS A RESULT OF THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE GRANTS AL QAEDA MOVEMENT OF OF DOLLARS IN EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY TO MEET THOSE -- FEDERAL GRANT REQUIREMENTS OKAY SO SO THIS IS FOR THE H. I. E. THAT HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE THEN THAT'S CORRECT AND WE'LL OF FOR THIS NEXT YEAR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK AND TRYING DO A BUDGET ADJUSTMENT AS AS FUNDS BECOME IDENTIFIED -- SPECIFICALLY FROM CMS WHICH WE ARE EXPECTING THAT FLOW SO SO JUST SO. BECAUSE YOU HAD SEVENTY MILLION BUDGET LAST YEAR WE ACTUALLY A TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT'S THE H. I. GRAND IT'S NOW BUDGETED FOR FIFTEEN MILLION SO WE'RE EXPECTING THIS IS A ONE YEAR GRANT TO OURS DO YOU EXPECT TO TRY TO GET MORE MONEY YOU SAVE -- SO THE GRANT -- IS UP TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. THROUGH SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWO FINANCE. TO DO THE RIGHT PROCESSING ON ON THE BUDGET YEAR AND THE OUT YEARS. THIS GRANT HAS A NINE TO ONE MATCH SO -- WERE AUTHORIZED UP TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS WE WE IF WE FIND FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THEY'LL TURN IT INTO FORTY MILLION DAY WHICH IS SOMETHING WE LOVE THE STATE TO LEARN HOW TO DO TO SIR WELL AND THAT YES EXACTLY. SO JUST SO JUST THE AND THE THE CLARIFIED AND AS FAR AS THIS COMING YEAR WHICH IS BACKED DOWN THE FIFTEEN MILLION THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY BUT BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN REALIZED YET TO ACTUALLY GET DRAW DOWN MORE MONEY. FOR THE HIV GRANT I'M LOOKING FINANCE NOW YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR HEAD. BILLION ARE ALMOST YEAH THAT'S CORRECTIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED AN AWARD WE WOULD ADJUSTED. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT YET PUT IN THE NUMBER I'D SO I UNDERSTAND HOW THAT SORT AND BY THE WAY AND I KNOW YOU'VE MADE MENTION OF IT IN YOUR OPENING. REMARKS -- BUT HOW HOW'S THAT GOING NOW THAT YOU KNOW SO IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A GOOD ONE LOVES LOVES THAT IDEA BUT HOW HOW'S THE IMPLEMENTATION GOING I MEAN WE'D BE ABLE TO CONNECT. CONNECT WITH ALL THE H. OURS HOW HOW'S THAT PROCESS YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED ON THE DISASTER SIDE WE'VE ALREADY CREATED IN THE NETWORK WHERE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD IT WHETHER THEY'RE IN -- SHELTERS ALTERNATE CARE SITES OR OTHER HOSPITALS CAN'T. LOG ON TO LOOK AT THE FOR EMERGENCIES. AND AND FUN AND I AM DEFINED DRAWDOWN PATIENT RECORDS -- IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL AIR AND WE HAVE EMS -- SYSTEMS PROVIDERS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS WHO ARE RIGHT NOW ABLE TO PULL UP PATIENT INFORMATION ON IPADS. IN THE FIELD -- WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY SUCCEEDED IN IN X. DO HAVING THE INFORMATION GO -- FROM THE FIELD INTO THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD YET AND GET OUTCOME DATA BACK BUT IT IS MOVING A QUITE WELL AND THAT'S ACTUALLY. I'LL GIVE THE CREDIT TO DAN HERE BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN HIS PET PROJECT. SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET MORE FEDERAL NINETY CONTINUED FOR DEVELOP THIS ABSOLUTELY AND SO CURRENTLY -- SAN DIEGO AND ORANGE COUNTY AND THOSE TWO JURISDICTIONS NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WE WERE ABLE O SUCCEED IN THOSE AREAS. AND WERE ABLE -- TO TO SEARCH -- SEND THE INFORMATION TO THE HOSPITAL -- AND THEN EMBEDDED IN THE HEALTH THE HEALTH RECORD IN SAN DIEGO IN PARTICULAR -- WE CAN ALSO IN SAN DIEGO PULL UP UP POST FORMS WHICH ARE POSITIONS ORDER FOR LIFE SUSTAINING TREATMENT -- KIND AND LIVE LIFE DECISIONS AND THE PARAMEDICS CAN THEN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION IN THE FIELD TO HELP THEM MAKE BETTER CLINICAL DECISIONS ALL RIGHT. AND THEN JUST OTHER I'D MAKE NOTE THAT -- WE LOOK AT FEDERAL FUNDS HERE -- SO YOU KNOW WE BUDGET SIX MILLION AND WE GOT SIX MILLION PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY BUT THEN THE BUDGET FOR IT. WENT DOWN THE FOUR MILLION SO WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THE FOR THE CENTURY THIRD DROP IN FEDERAL FUNDS WERE EXPECTING THAT'S HERE. IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE I BELIEVE IT'S A A I THINK IT'S A REIMBURSEMENT ADJUSTMENT -- BASED UPON THE UPCOMING -- A FEDERAL FUND PERIOD AND I THINK THAT -- IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS SOME OF THIS IS IS IMPACTED FROM OTHER HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ALSO OKAY SO I GUESS I'LL DEFERRED A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE EXACT DETAILS ON DOWN THAT IS WHAT I WHAT I HAVE HERE AND YET AND ON THE YOU KNOW. WE HAVE ON THE TOP LINE WE HAVE GENERAL FUND FEDERAL FUNDS OTHER FUNDS DETAIL BELOW. SO FEDERAL FUNDS SIX MILLION AND AND THAT WAS UNDER OTHER FUNDS I'M JUST TRYING TO CLARIFY LIKE OKAY WHAT WHICH ONES ARE COMING FROM WHICH POT AND SO -- SO TO THIS SO I'M LOOKING AT THE LINES AS FEDERAL FUNDS -- EIGHT NINE OO. AND SO THAT ALSO INVOLVED WITH THE H. A YEAR NOW. IF FOR BETTER WHAT FUNDS SPECIFICALLY YES YEAH MILLION DROP IS JUST A REDUCTION IN THE FEDERAL GRANT THERE WAS A ONE TIME GRANT THAT WAS RECEIVED. FOR PULLS UP A POST TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO WE JUST ADJUST VIDEO OKAY SO BASICALLY THERE'S A THERE'S INCLUSION OF THE PULSE GRANTS AND SO THEREFORE THAT ARE FUNDS HOURS RECEIVED IT ENDED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO WHICH IS A JUST OK SO OKAY SO THAT. OKAY SO IT'S A DIFFERENT PART MONEY IN FEDERAL MONEY ALL RIGHT -- AND THE WORK FOR THAT GRANT I MEAN IS IT CONCLUDED IS WAS THAT OUR IS THAT GOING TO BE A ISSUE FOR EMS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE GRANT WAS FUNDING BEFORE. SO -- THE THE PREVIOUS GRANT WAS THE ONE TIME -- IN OFFICE THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY GRANT THAT WAS INCLUDED AND SO -- THAT WORK HAS CONCLUDED AT THIS POINT AND SO THAT THE NEW GRANT -- AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS TO DO A SECTION TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE IN -- IN IN THE NEXT YEAR PROCESS WILL BE INCLUDING THOSE PARTICULAR -- POSITIONS -- AND AS THIS GRANT AND SO IS THEIR DESTRUCTION ARE OKAY SO THAT'S GONNA BE PICKED UP WITH ANOTHER.

UNTIL THAT PATIENT IS ACCEPTED -- BY THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT STAFF AND WHERE AS IN MINUTE MOST PLACES THAT IS VERY SHORT TIME PERIOD.

A HAND TO HAND OUT THAT WILL SHOW YOU ADAM AND CHART EARLIER YEARS PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS ACTUALLY RECEIVED OVER 30% OF ALL AVAILABLE FUNDING AND S OWN AND IN THE MOST RECENT TWO ALLOCATIONS IN WHICH THAT FROM FUNDING OVERALL FUNDING FOR SOME AROUND DRAMATICALLY INCREASED. PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS ONLY RECEIVED ABOUT 4% OF AVAILABLE FUNDING AND SAW NO ACTUAL REAL DOLLAR INCREASES IN THEIR FUNDING -- AND SO WE'RE SEEKING TO RECTIFY THIS BY ASKING THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED SET ASIDE APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE AVAILABLE FUNDING. THE SECOND CHART THAT WE PROVIDED SHOWS YOU HOW THE PROPOSAL WOULD WORK BASED ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FINISH OUT THE THREE YEARS FOR AS PROPOSED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. AND ALSO TO DO THIS ON AN ONGOING BASIS WERE ACTUALLY ASKING THAT AN EXTRA TWO MILLION DOLLARS BE ALLOCATED TO THE PROGRAM EACH YEAR SO THAT THE FOR IS MADE UP OF THE MONEY PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS HAVE TRADITIONALLY RECEIVED FROM Sí FUNDING AND BY DOING IT THAT WE WERE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PULLING MONEY AWAY FROM ANY OTHER PROGRAM TYPES WHO MAY HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE CHANGE TO THE RULES. SO I JUST WANNA AND BY SHARING A TWO REASONS WHY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS THE BEST A ADEQUATELY FUND PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS THE FIRST TO AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR PEDIATRIC ACT PEDIATRICIANS RECEIVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. ACUTE CARE TRAINING WITH CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS AND ALLOWS THEM TO HANDLE A LOT OF CONDITIONS IN THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT HAVING TO REFER A CHILD TO URGENT CARE OR TO A SPECIALIST. MRS MORE HELPFUL FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND ALSO CAN BE A COST SAVINGS TO PAY YEARS INCLUDING THE STATE -- AND SO WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF PEDIATRICIANS IN THE COMMUNITY. SECONDLY PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS STEVE DRAMATICALLY LES FEDERAL FUNDING THAN OTHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS TO OVER 50% OF PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED BY CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS TO RECEIVE NO. LITTLE TO NO MEDICARE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION FUNDING -- AND AS A RESULT AND THE FUNDING THAT THEY DO RECEIVE FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL DOESN'T COVER THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE -- AND AS A RESULT THEY CAN OFFER FEWER SLOTS TO PEDIATRICIANS SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH OF THESE REASONS AT THE STATE MAKE SURE THAT PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS ARE RECEIVING A FAIR SHARE OF THE FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE AND WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL INCLUDE OUR PROPOSAL IN FINAL BUDGET. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. BYE SURPRISE -- PRESSES CLOSE I WAS A FORMER PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY DIRECTORS AND SOME FAMILIARITY WITH FINANCING -- PRESIDENCY EDUCATION --% FIRST ACTUALLY AND ANY COMMENTS FROM ASHKHABAD -- IN THOSE THOSE SAID THAT -- THERE'S ACTUALLY EVEN THE KLEIN IN FUNNY PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND YOU CRITERIA SO PERHAPS CAN YOU TRUST THAT -- WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T TAKE A POSITION AT THIS TIME BUT S OWN IS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A COMPETITIVELY. FUNDED PROGRAM COMPETITIVELY BASED PROGRAM AND THE CHIPS KIND OF FALL WHERE THEY MAY -- I I DO KNOW THAT I'VE PERSONALLY. PRESENTED A CHECK TO THE OAKLAND CHILDREN'S OF PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS I KNOW THAT SOME PROGRAMS ARE GETTING SOME FUNDS [inaudible] BUT TO SO WHY SHE MAY BE -- WELL ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE MANY QUESTIONS MEGLIO. FINANCE. WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A POSITION AT THIS TIME SINCE YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW BUT WE WANT TO KNOW THAT'S NOT PART OF THAT GOVERNOR SPENDING PLAN -- HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN FURTHER DISCUSSION OKAY. WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS FROM AS FAR NOT THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE INITIAL -- GOVERNOR SPENDING PLAN I WOULD MENTION CENTER IS THAT -- IF YOU DO START CARVING OUT SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR CPAS BOX BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S BEEN A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS LEGISLATURE ON THIS OKAY. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS A GUEST CENTER SEVEN THANK YOU AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND YEP BUT YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU PRESENT A BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE USUALLY WHICH ARE PRESENT IT'S NOT WHAT USUALLY ENDS UP BEING AND THE THE FINAL PRODUCT? OF THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THINGS ARE AMENDED AND I'M SURE THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL BE. OPEN TO ENLIGHTENMENT SEND AND YOU YOU CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN LYING TO US WITH THE THE NEED FOR MORE MONEY FOR PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY IS IN A MUCH YOU KNOW THAT I SUPPORT THAT -- MOST OF THE ADMISSIONS THAT WE HAVE IT EMERGENCY ROOMS ARE FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS IS DOCTOR PAN BRADLEY KNOWS. AND WE HAVE A PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE WORK HARD WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES. JUMP START IF YOU WILL YOU SEE ARMED MEDICAL SCHOOL -- TOOK A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION FROM OUR BOARD. TO GET THE STATE. TO BASICALLY CHRIS ON THE THE NEW NEW NEW NEW MEDICAL SCHOOL SO -- AND I APPRECIATE THE THE GOVERNOR'S EXTENSION TO THE MONEY THAT ALREADY HAS BEEN ALLOCATED BY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS COVERING FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS I THINK THIS IS STARTING IN -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE THE THE ON GOING COMMITMENT -- BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW IF THAT WE CAN SAY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE APPRECIATE THE THE GOVERNOR'S ENTHUSIASTS ABOUT THIS BUT I HAVE A QUESTION THAT MAYBE THE LA -- AND AND THE OFFICE FINANCE CAN. KNOWING THAT WE HAVE A PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND KNOWING THAT. MANY OF THE PHYSICIANS THAT TAKE RESIDENCIES OFTEN STATE WHERE THE RESIDENCY IS. WHAT IS OUR CAPACITY? WHAT IS THE NUMBER NOT I'M MISSING WAS OUR CAPACITY TO FIND BUT HOW MANY RESIDENCIES CAM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACCOMMODATE? IN THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AND SAY OKAY WHAT KIND OF MONEY WE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE WELL I THINK THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AS A A VERY. GOOD INVESTMENT -- I AM CONCERNED MADE WERE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO TO TO FACILITATE THIS -- THE SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS THAT WE HAVEN'T STATE CALIFORNIA I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE TO YOURSELVES OR NOT BUT IF NOT I'D LIKE. TO MAYBE GET THAT NUMBERS NUMBER FROM YOU. HI THEIR BEN JOHNSON THE LA OUT -- WE DO HAVE DATA ON THE EXISTING RESIDENCY SLOTS THAT ARE -- THAT THAT ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE OVERALL CAPACITY IS -- I IMAGINE WOULD BE A MORE CHALLENGING QUESTION AS IT WOULD. INVOLVE SURVEYING HOSPITALS FOR THE RESIDENTS SEE SLOTS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE YOU KNOW CAPACITY IN TERMS OF PATIENT FLOWS TO BE ABLE TO SERVE -- BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO SORT OF SEE WHAT KINDS OF INFORMATION WE CAN PROVIDE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL OKAY. TONIGHT BUT JUST ADD REALLY QUICK YES. AND I ALSO HAVE SOME DATA SO THERE'S ANOTHER SOURCE OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION FUNDING FROM POP FIFTY SIX LAST YEAR THERE WAS FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR HOSPITALS. AND BASED ON THE APPLICATIONS RECEIVED AND THAT HAD TO BE FOR OUR SLOTS THAT WERE GONNA BE NEW SLOTS SO EXPANDED PROGRAMS -- THEY WERE OVERSUBSCRIBED THEY'VE HAD A TOTAL REQUEST OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION TO FOR THAT PROGRAM. SO. WITH BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS TOGETHER WERE STILL ONLY FUNDING ABOUT HALF THE REQUEST FOR NEW PROGRAMS LOTS SO THERE'S QUITE A LARGE CAPACITY THAT'S NOT BE. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND IT KIND OF THE LANES BE THAT. THERE'S THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE CAN DO -- I KNOW FOR TALKING ABOUT MONEY WE'RE TALKING APART ORTIZ THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BUDGET SUB THE THREE IS TO MAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO I LOOK. FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN ENHANCE -- SLOTS FUNNY SLIDE THE THE PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE IN THE STATE AND APPRECIATE THE TROYER PROCEED PRESENTATION THANK YOU FOR THE FIGURES [inaudible] QUESTION. US SELF AFTER SPONSORS A FEW SHE YOUR INTERESTS TO SOMEONE WHO IN MY PRIOR LIFE BEFORE YOU ON THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY -- DID QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH WORK -- AND PHYSICIAN AND HEALTH PROFESSIONS WORK FORCE -- CERTAINLY I THINK IT'S THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL CONTINUE EXPLORED OBVIOUSLY NOT ONLY IN THIS PART OF YOUR WITH US BUT WE GET TO PROP FIFTY SIX WILL BE TALKING A LOT MORE ABOUT SORT OF FUNDING AND FINANCING -- FOR RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS BUT I DID WANT TO JUST -- BORN JUST GET BACK O YOU SO YOU SAID IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT THERE. SO I SUFFERS OF I WANT TO SAY THAT -- I APPRECIATE -- WHAT I SPOT IS SAYING THAT YOU KNOW S N'T DO IT SPECIAL TO BY SPECIALTY AND MINUTES FOR PRIMARY CARE BUT WE DON'T DO SPECIAL A SPECIALTY AND THERE'S CERTAIN AND I THINK YOU RECENT CONCERNS -- AND I I AND I I WOULD SURE SOME OF THAT THAT WE START SLICING IT BY SPECIALTY THAT CREATES THAT MAY CREATE SOME INHERENT ISSUES -- SO BUT YOU ALSO SEND YOUR TEST CRITERIA THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU THINK IS DRIVING THIS FUNDING AWAY FROM PEDIATRIC THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE. AN APPROPRIATE ARE HAVE AS WELL THAT THAT MEANT THAT YOU WOULD MIGHT CONSIDER TO BE OUT ON FAIRS TIED UP RIGHT WORD BUT BUT MAYBE LEADING TO VISITS. TO OUTCOMES THAT. ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF PEDIATRIC TRAINING GATHERS TWO CRITERIA THAT WERE ADDED ONLY ONE OF WHICH IS COMING TO MY MIND RIGHT NOW -- BUT IT WAS THAT ONE WAS THE CRITERIA FOR AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS IN A CONTINUITY CARE CLINIC AND PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE PART OF THEM THEY NEVER EXCEED MORE THAN. FOUR SO AND IT WAS -- TEN POINTS THAT WAS ZERO OR TEN WHETHER YOU MET THAT CRITERIA AND NOT BECAUSE ALL THE PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS TO JUST AUTOMATICALLY SCORED TEN POINTS LOWER. THERE WAS ONE OTHER ONE THAT I'M DRAWING A BLANK ON THAT ALSO IMPACTED PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS AND WHEN WE REACHED OUT. TO OUR SPOT STAFF LAST YEAR THE INDICATION THAT WE GOT WAS THAT THIS WAS DONE INTENTIONALLY. TO PULL MONEY AWAY FROM PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS TOWARDS THE OTHER TYPES AND THE RATIONALE WAS THAT 1100% LIKE FAMILY MEDICINE PROGRAMS RECEIVED MOST OF THE BENEFIT OF THAT. SHIFT BUT THOSE PROGRAMS LIKE CARE WHERE IT'S IN ANY GIVEN YEAR IT'S ABOUT 50% OF PEDIATRIC PROGRAM OF PEDIATRICIANS WILL GO INTO PRIMARY CARE SO THEY SAW THAT IS A BETTER BANG FOR THEIR BUCK. THE PROBLEM IS THAT AS YOU KNOW PEDIATRICIANS AND THAT WE FOR NOT TRAINING THEM WE WILL SLOWLY LOSE THE NUMBER THAT WE HAVE IN THE COMMUNITY -- SO WE THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FUNDING A PRIMARY CARE SLOT. FOR EXAMPLE POSITIONS FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA THAT'S DISTRIBUTING BUT PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY LOOKS AT HOW MANY PLACEMENTS YOU HAVE IN A PRIMARY KATIE CARE SETTING FIVE YEARS OUT AND THEY ALSO AWARD EXTRA POINTS. FOR IF YOU HAVE A PRIMARY CARE TRACKING YOUR RESIDENCY PROGRAM SO THERE'S WAYS TO CREATE POINT SYSTEMS THAT REWARD HOSPITALS THAT TRAIN PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICIANS WITHOUT DISRUPTING THE MONEY TO ANOTHER TYPE OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL AND HOPEFULLY MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT NOW I MAYBE I'LL MAKE A PERSONAL COMMENTS ON WHO ACTUALLY SERVED ON THE CREATION COUNSEL FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION THAT -- PERHAPS ACTUALLY PEDIATRICS CONSIDER INCREASING OUTPATIENT TRAINING -- ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE CREATE FELLOWSHIP IN HOSPITALS TRAINING IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A DETACHED SINCE -- BUT THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THE PEDIATRIC ME AS A FIGURE OUT -- BUT YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT -- THEM WE SERVE JIMMY DOLLARS -- TO ALSO BE SURE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PRACTICE IN THE AREAS OF NEED THAT'S PRIMARY CARE. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES SO FORTH SO -- SO -- BILL WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE TAKING UP A THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL IN TERMS VOTING TODAY -- SO I I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION I THINK YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK AT I I DO SHARE THE CONCERNS OF OUR SPOT ABOUT. AND DAY I'M A PEDIATRICIAN AND HEY WHY LET'S SEE MORE BEACH YEAH WE I I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR TEACHERS AND IN TERMS OF DESIGNATING FOR PARTICULAR SPECIALTIES AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHETHER. FUNDING -- MOTHER TO THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED -- THAT AROUND -- PEDIATRICS RAINY WEATHER THIS IS WHAT IT THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO ADDRESS IT IN TERMS OF WHY SAID WHETHER THROUGH SONG BROWN OR MAYBE SOME OTHER ME APPROACH -- SO -- HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE THAT DONE AND SO BETWEEN NOW AND MAY REVISE HEALTH LEADERS TO BE SOME CONVERSATIONS AND THINKING ABOUT WHICH DIRECTION WE'RE GOING WITH THEIR VARIOUS WORKFORCE INCLUDING SONG BROWN. AND AND AND THE FUNDING -- THERE AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE -- THE GOVERNOR'S -- PROPOSAL TO A CONTINGENCY FUND AS THE SOMETHING LEGISLATURE'S BEEN FIGHTING FOR AND SAID DOING IT TO CONFUSE THE FUNDS ON BROWN BECAUSE WHEN YOU RUN A RESIDENCY PROGRAM ANY TYPE. YOU NEED YEAH YOU DON'T WANT TO BRING ON A RESIDENT AND THEN HAVE THE MONEY RIGHT NOW AND AND AND TELL RESIDENT THAT WE CAN'T YOU CAN COMPLETE YOUR TRAINING BECAUSE WITHOUT THE MONEY TO DO THAT SO THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT I WANT RECOGNIZE THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR FOR BEING SURE THAT THEY ADDRESS THAT ISSUE CELL THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY -- THE NEXT STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL IS ACTUALLY BEGIN. THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY A CRISTINA HICKS FROM CALIFORNIA HEALTH ADVOCATES -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRISTINA HEX DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION OR SEE PCA. IF YOU SEE A IN THEIR ADVOCACY AFFILIATE CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES REPRESENT CALIFORNIA'S OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED NOT FOR PROFIT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS WHICH EMPLOY OVER FORTY THOUSAND STAFF STATEWIDE. AND PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO NEARLY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE EACH YEAR. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR STAKEHOLDER BUDGET REQUEST TO YOU TODAY WHICH AIMS TO BOLSTER PROVIDER RECRUITMENT EFFORTS AND SAGE AND HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH A FEW RECENT STATISTICS WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS NEED. THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY REPORTED THAT MORE THAN SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS LEVIN HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS ARE HAVE SAYS. WHICH IS A FEDERAL DESIGNATION FOR COUNTIES X. CARE DENTAL CARE OR MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. WE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY MEETING THAT NEED. ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE HEALTH FOR CENTER T UCSF CALIFORNIA IS PROJECTED TO HAVE A SHORTFALL OF MORE THAN FORTY ONE HUNDRED PRIMARY CLEAR COMMISSION. PRIMARY CARE CLINICIANS BY TWENTY THIRTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSION SHORTAGES ARE ALSO CONCERNING WITH AN EXISTING 11% SHORTAGE OF PSYCHOLOGISTS MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS CLINICAL COUNSELORS AND SOCIAL WORKERS. THIS IS WHAT BRINGS ME HERE TODAY ASKING FOR YOUR HELP. DESPITE MOUNTING PRESSURE AND DEMAND TO EXPAND THE STATION AT HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE IN NEARLY ALL PARTS OF THE STATE. MANY SAFETY NET PROVIDERS LIKE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ARE UNABLE TO RECRUIT THE NECESSARY WORKFORCE TO MEET THE NEED. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS REPORTED THAT THE INABILITY TO OFFER COMPETITIVE SALARIES AND BENEFIT PACKAGES ARE AMONG THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE CHALLENGE OF RECORDING THE NECESSARY WORKFORCE. KNACK FOR THE REPORTS THAT NEARLY 95% OF ALL HEALTH CENTERS NATIONWIDE ARE EXPERIENCING AT LEAST ONE CLINICAL VACANCY AND AT TIMES AVERAGE NEARLY ONE YEAR TO FILL A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER POSITION. TO MEET THIS NEED ADVOCATES RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU CONSIDER A ONE TIME FUNDING ALLOCATION OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR GRANTS. TO BE ADMINISTERED BY US BAD TO EXPAND THE PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE FOR CALIFORNIA'S UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THESE DOLLAR SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ELIGIBLE SAGE AND ORGANIZATIONS FOR PROVIDER RECRUITMENT EFFORTS SUCH AS RECRUITMENT OR SIGNING INCENTIVES OR HOUSING AND RELOCATION COSTS. WE ALSO RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THERE EXIST FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE ALLOCATION OF THESE DOLLARS THAT ALLOWS FOR REGIONALIZED APPROACH AS WELL HOUSING SUBSIDIES MAY BE VITAL TO RECRUITING PROVIDERS TO URBAN AREAS OF THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE. IT MAY BE THAT RELOCATION ASSISTANCE IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENTICE A NEWLY CERTIFIED AND HEAVILY INDEBTED PROVIDER TO TAKE A POSITION IN A ROLE OR MORE PART OF THE STATE. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WE ENCOURAGE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA CONSIDERATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN EXISTING WORKFORCE SUPPORT PROGRAMS. PARTICULARLY WE SUGGEST GRANTS BE MADE CLINICS IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS TO A PATIENT POPULATIONS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 50% MEDI CAL. ARE UNINSURED HAVE INCOMES UNDER LEVEL OR A COMBINATION THERE I'VE. WE ALSO PROPOSE THAT ELIGIBLE PROVIDER TYPES INCLUDE BOARD CERTIFIED PRIMARY CARE POVIDERS SUCH AS ANDY'S INDIOS NURSE PRACTITIONERS CERTIFIED MIDWIVES AND A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANCE. AS WELL AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS SUCH AS PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST AND LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROPRIATE THIS ONE TIME FIFTY MILLION ALLOCATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH LEGISLATOR ON THIS REQUEST WE THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR CONSIDERING THE SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- ANY COMMENTS FROM A SPOT ON THIS OKAY LA -- FINANCE. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO THANKS MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- SO THE IT IS WRITTEN AT SOME ESTIMATES OF THE CITY MILLION IT'S GOING TO WRITE A DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES HAD RECRUITED SIGNING HOUSING RELOCATION AS MENTIONED SELLER BENEFITS OF THESE I MEAN HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK. WERE. EXPECTING THE HOPEFULLY RECRUIT WITH THAT THE FIFTY MILLION AND IT'S A ONE TIME SO THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE TRICKY. TO YEAH IT DOES YES -- I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO LEAVE IT TO THE EXPERTISE OF OUR SPOT IN TERMS OF THE GRANT A PARTICULAR SIZE WHICH OF COURSE WOULD IMPACT THE NUMBERS THAT WE COULD -- BRING INTO THE SAFETY NET -- AND RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WOULD BE A ONE TIME -- SUBSIDY -- IT COULD BE FOR OTHER KINDS OF INCENTIVES THAT AGAIN JUST HELP BRING THAT THE PROVIDERS INTO THE SAFETY NET -- RECOGNIZING THAT THE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS DON'T HAVE ANY ESTIMATE AS TO SELL FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF PUBLIC MONEY HOW MANY. PEOPLE WERE HOPING TO GET FOR THIS EVENT AS ANY ANALYSIS OF ANY SORT IN TERMS OF I MEAN SO YEAH. YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CONSUMERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES -- I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT YOU RAISE I WOULD JUST MENTION THAT WE'RE REALLY JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I THINK I'M FIRST WHAT THE NEED IS. AND SO JUST WE DID OF LIKE A BACK OF THE ENVELOPE NUMBERS ASSUMPTION AND IF EVERY HEALTH CENTRE APPLIED FOR A GRANT AND GOT OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT NOT SAYING THAT SHOULD BE THE NUMBER -- THAT WOULD BE ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY H. PROVIDERS STATEWIDE. SO I I AGAIN I THINK IT DEPEND THAT AND THOSE ARE JUST HEALTH CENTERS AND THIS WOULD BE UP THIS TO BE APPLICABLE TO PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND OTHER FACILITIES TO SO THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF AROUND NUMBER. TO GIVE YOU -- TICKETS FOR YOUR ESTIMATES RIGHT NOW BUT WE ARE INTERESTED IN AND THROUGH TRYING TO SURVEY WHAT THE NEED IS AND SEEING IF THE STOLLER AMOUNT WOULD HAVE THE IMPACT THAT WE HOPE IT WOULD. OKAY NO I MADE A PRE SHEET THAT CERTAINLY -- EIGHTY ENDING MADE AN EXCELLENT CASE ABOUT THE NEED AND BUT I THINK ALSO AS A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE GALLON SOMEONE SAYS I WANT EX NUMBER OF DOLLARS IS ALSO EXPECTED TO HAPPEN WITH THAT RIGHT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF DIFFERENCE DO SO AND I REALIZED THERE'S THERE'S GOING. TO ALL THE BILL THE BACK OF AN AFGHAN ARE BACK THE ENVELOPE THE TIMES -- BECAUSE UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY DO THE ONE TIME BUT SOME OF THE HOUSE. RECRUITMENT SIGNEE INCENTIVE. FOR HOW THE OTHER RELOCATION PERCENT BUT LIKE A I MEAN. I GUESS THE THING IS IS A SO YOU LOOK LIKE BASICALLY ONE TIME INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE -- TO COME ON BOARD THE THAT AND FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE RECRUITING PEOPLE. THIS DAY IS THAT GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT OR PEOPLE THAT SAY WELL YOU KNOW THEN TERMS OF DON GOING SALARY OR WHATEVER BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET ARE YOU ABLE TO IF YOU SEE ME THAT. OKAY WE GIVE YOU SOME HELP TO GET. SOME PLACE TO LIVE ONE TIME THAT'S GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE RETENTION I I'M ALSO THINKING BUT NOT A RECRUITMENT BUT SUSTAINABILITY IN TERMS OF RETENTION. WELL WE RECOGNIZE ACTUALLY THAT ARE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW RETENTION STRATEGIES LOWER PAYMENT BEING AMONG THEM AND I THINK THIS IS WOULD BE A COMPATIBLE STRATEGY WITH A LONGER PAYMENT -- PROGRAM BUT LOAN PAYMENT IS AND IT IS IS INCOMING UPON HAVING A PROVIDER AT YOUR FACILITY THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT BENEFIT. TO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS ACROSS THE STATE OF FOR THAT THEY'RE VERY REGIONALIZED THERE'S A FEW HEALTH PLANS I THINK THREE THAT WE CAN NO I HAVE. THAT ARE STARTING TO DO THIS THAT ARE SEEING SUCCESSES BUT IT IS RELATIVELY NEW AND THOSE ARE PROGRAMS AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE KIND OF THAT STATISTICS IN THE OUTCOMES OF THAT. BUT WE SEE THAT IT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE RENTS OF APPROACH. I THINK WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN. THIS YOU KNOW SAID MORE -- HAS BEEN BETWEEN NOW AND MAY. IS ALSO SIR FLUSHING OUT MORE OF THE BACK OF THE NAPKIN BACK OF THE ENVELOPE CALCULATION BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT HOW WITH THIS. EFFORT IN ON THIS MONEY -- THEN LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDS OR OTHER EFFORTS IT PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW I THINK I SEE THIS AT LEAST -- SINCE YOU SAID ONE TIME I' THINKING THIS IS MORE SO IT WAS LIKE THIS IS THE RECRUITMENT BONUS ARE THE INCENTIVE TO GET PEOPLE END BUT WHAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE A SAY WE CAN LEVERAGE FOR ATTENTION SO THAT WANT TO BRING SOMEONE IN. THE GUIDE STAY RATE THAT WE HAVE OTHER TYPES OF FUNDS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TAP INTO OR OTHER TYPES OF RESOURCES ARE STRATEGIES WE HAVE. TO KEEP THEM. THEY'RE RIGHT BECAUSE THE TURN ISN'T GOOD EITHER SO -- SO IT DOES DEPRECIATE THE REQUEST FOR THE RECRUITMENT STUFF THAT ALSO HOUSES FIT INTO THE LARGER PICTURE SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD THAT HEALTH OF THAT -- WORKFORCE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING -- FOR IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND CLINICS. RIGHT. OKAY ALL. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. OKAY AND FINALLY WE HAVE -- THE ANDHRA CLARK HARVEY FROM THE CARRIER FOR A COUNCIL FOR COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH AGENCIES SO MY IN THE HIGHER FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION MET MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS AND JANE.

WE REPRESENT BEHAVIOR HOLLOW ACTIONS ARE COUNTY IS THAT EACH OF THE PEOPLE THAT -- EVERYBODY INTRODUCE AND THEN YOU CAN BEGIN YOUR TESTIFYING. TO MY AND HEART HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST Q.. NINE JANE ADCOCK EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL OKAY NAY OF TEN EXTRA SECONDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DO INTRODUCTIONS ADDING SERVICES TO MANY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. ODD TOGETHER WITH OUR CO SPONSORS HAVE INTRODUCED THEMSELVES -- WE REQUEST A SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE WORK FORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TRUST FUND WHICH WOULD FIND MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES AND COST BEDS FIVE YOUR WORK FORCE PLAN WHICH YOU'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ALREADY. SO WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKFORCE CRISIS ON THAT IMPACTING OUR STATE AND WE KNOW THAT AUSPICE PLAN REALLY LAYS THE FRAMEWORK TO SOLVING THIS CRISIS BUT THERE'S NO ON GOING DEDICATED FUNDING FOR THE PLAN. AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FUNDING REQUEST WOULD ALLOW FOR STRENGTHENING THE PIPELINE PROVIDING INCENTIVES TO PROFESSIONALS AND ENSURING CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE MEMBERS PROVIDE NEEDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO YOU. I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST TO THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAMS AND ALSO PUT THE PLAN AS I WAS THE RECIPIENT OF BOTH STATEMENT AND LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS ONCE I COMPLETED MY DOCTORATE IN PSYCHOLOGY ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO. SO MY COLLEAGUES WHEN US NEXT DISCUSS -- THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FIVE YEAR PLAN AND CAMPUS WILL FURTHER DISCUSS THE WORK FORCE CRISIS FOR LICENSED PROFESSIONALS. WE'D LIKE TO SPECIFICALLY THANK SENATOR ANA CABALLERO FOR CHAMPION AND CHAMPIONING THIS CALL SHE CIRCULATING A LETTER SUPPORT -- FOR THIS PROPOSAL TORE SENATE COLLEAGUES AND WE THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING A REQUEST. AS MENTIONED I'M WITH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL THE COUNCIL IS MANDATED IN STATE LAW TO SERVE AS AN ADVISORY ROLE TO THE LEGISLATURE. ON THE ISSUES POLICIES AND PRIORITIES FOR CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. WE ALSO HAVE THE RULE OF OVERSIGHT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EACH OF THE WORK FORCE FIVE YEAR PLANS. IN THERE ARE INVITED THREE ROLLED THE COUNCIL STRONGLY URGES YOUR COMMITTEE SUPPORT ULTIMATELY OF THIS ONE TIME REQUEST OF SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO INSURE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEXT FIVE YEAR PLAN. THIS REQUEST IS JUST PART OF A BROADER STRATEGY TO SECURE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR THE PLANS AS THEY ARE AN ONGOING REQUIREMENT. THE COUNCIL HAS BEEN DOCUMENTING THE WORK FOR SHORTED SINCE THE LATE NINETIES BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT. THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION RELEASED ITS RECOMMENDATIONS THREE OF ITS TOP TEN RECOMMENDATIONS ADDRESS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. ALSO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION ALONG WITH KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION RELEASED THE RESULTS OF THE RECENT POLL 52% OF CALIFORNIANS STATE THAT THEY DO NOT FEEL THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO MEET THE NEEDS. WE WERE TOLD THAT TWENTY THREE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NO PSYCHIATRIST. SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS NO HEALTH WITHOUT PUBLIC WITHOUT MENTAL HEALTH. SO THIS IS AN URGENT NEED AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST. I THINK SHE JUST LEFT EIGHT SECONDS. HI I'M A CAMPUS PROP TO CO SPONSOR THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE SEVENTY MILLION TO SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TRUST FUND OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. I'M AND THIS FUNDING IS NECESSARY BECAUSE IT WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT MORE QUALIFIED AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE PROVIDERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS I'M AND WILL HELP TO EXPAND THE PUBLIC MENTAL HELTH SYSTEM. THIS FUNDING WILL HELP TO ADDRESS A SHORTAGE OF BILINGUAL AND DIVE FIRST TIME PROFESSIONALS BY PROVIDING INCENTIVE FOR STUDENTS -- WITH DIFFERENT CULTURAL BACKGROUND TO PURSUE A CAREER IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSION. SO WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOU'RE CONSIDERING. ANY COMMENTS OR OBSERVATIONS FROM MUCH FUND OKAY LA -- FINANCE NOW OKAY QUESTIONS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS A CENTER. SEVEN I APPRECIATE THE THE REQUEST -- WHAT WHY AREAS -- REQUESTING THIS TO COME FROM THE GENERAL FUND RATHER THAN MENTAL HEALTH AND SO WE HAVE AND STATE. PROP [inaudible] SIXTY THREE I'M. ARE YOU STALKING ADMIN DOLLARS OR THE IMAGE TO SEE LOCALIZATIONS REVENUES OR THE 5% ADMIN DOLLARS THE STATE BY. AGAIN STATEWIDE. FUNDS THE LOCAL ISSUES TENTH -- SO AS I MENTIONED THAT THIS REQUEST AS PART OF A BROADER STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABLE FUNDING WITH THE SUSTAINABLE FINDING THE PROPOSAL IN SENATOR COUPLE YEAR WAS BILL IS. TO UTILIZED 25% OF GROSS FUNDS INTO THE IMAGE TO SAY FUND TO GO IN THE INTO THE TRUST FUND FOR WORKFORCE THAT WE'RE ASKING TO BE ESTABLISHED HERE. COUNTIES WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO TRANSPONDERS TRANSFER UNUSED MHSAA DOLLARS INTO THE FUND. FOR USE FOR WORK FORCE SO ON THE ON GOING WE ARE EXPECTING TO UTILIZE AND AND MAY TO SAY FUNDS AS A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OKAY THANK YOU. IF I MAY SENATOR SO I I THINK WHAT WITHOUT CON IS ALSO A TWENTY TWO IS THAT WE HAVE A UP A STRATEGY THAT'S COUPLE TOGETHER WITH A LEGISLATIVE A VEHICLE GET THE EFFORT. YOU KNOW JUMP STARTED FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS AND WE HVE A BILL THAT ADDRESSES THE ONGOING FUNDING -- ISSUE AND LOOKS AT ME TO SAY FUNDS WHICH I THINK YOU ARE RIGHTLY POINTING. TO GREAT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- SO ACTUALLY -- AND OVER THERE PERHAPS LA OF FINANCE AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAD. FUNDING FOR WET THROUGH -- PROP SIXTY THREE AND THEY DON'T PLAN FOR GETTING LAST YEAR THE PROBLEM WAS THE MONEY WAS READY OUT BEFORE THE PLAN. AND AND SO -- MAYBE CAN THEY BE FINANCE COLLABORATORS TO LAST YEAR LIKE WHAT FINALLY HAPPENED THAT MEANS IS -- WITH THAT. JAIL AND UPON A FINANCE ALASTOR THERE IS A TEN MILLION MHSAA AUGMENTATION. TO PROVIDE BY THE LEGISLATURE TO FINISH OUT THE FINAL YEAR OF THE SECOND FIVE YEAR PLAN -- CORNER STATUTE THERE IS NO DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE THIRD AN ONGOING ITERATIONS OF THE PLAN -- I THINK THE ONLY THING I CAN ADD IS THE OBJECTIVES OUTLINED BY THE STICKLE APPROVALS ARE BROADLY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING AN ISSUE FOR SO. WE CAN. SPEAK MORE OR PROPOSAL WHAT THAT TIME OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO I REALIZE WE HAVEN'T PRESENTED THAT THESE FOREIGN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING -- AS A FIFTY MILLION -- SO HOW HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR PROPOSAL. YEAH FITTING IN WITH THE ARE LINING UP WITH ARE SO AND ARE ACT IN RELATION TO THE TO THAT FIFTY MILLION PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF FOR BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH I REALIZE WE HAVEN'T HEARD IT YET HERE BUT HOPEFULLY YOU. YES I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR A SPIN -- HOWEVER IS FIFTY MILLION IS NOT. ALLOCATED OR EXPECTED TO BE pIN THE FIVE YEAR PLANS -- THE LOAN ASSUMPTION PROGRAM MAYES SHARES SOME OVERLP BUT THERE OR SIGNIFICANT OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE FIVE YEAR PLAN TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE. IT OR NOT FUNDED. ALL RIGHT AND ACTUALLY MAYBE QUESTION FOR FINANCE ELEMENTS OF THIS THAT IT'S A YOU TO DEVELOP ANOTHER FIVE YEAR PLAN RIGHT WITH US BY RAISE THE COUNCIL APPROVED IN JANUARY RIGHT OKAY AND WAS THAT PART OF WAS BUT IT WAS THAT PLAN. PART OF THE DISCUSSION WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPING THE DEMONSTRATIONS PROPOSAL -- THE FIFTY MILLION FOR WORK -- MENTAL HEALTH CARE WORKING ELEMENT IS NOT PART OF OF WHAT FUNDING IT'S CHAIR AT SEPARATE. ON AND ON SINCE THE PLAN WAS NOT FINALIZED UNTIL JANUARY IT WAS NO PREMATURE TO INCLUDE FUNDING FOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OKAY SO SO BASICALLY THE PLAN HAD COME OUT YET AT TIME YOU'RE DEVELOPING VEGETABLES THAT. BETWEEN NOW AND MAY IS THIRD DEED AS THERE'S GONNA BE SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WE HAVE THIS PLAN THAT WAS DEVELOPED AND HOW THAT MIGHT FIT IN INTO -- INTO WHATEVER OUR ULTIMATE -- BUDGET WILL BE AROUND -- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE.

TAKE A SEAT UP HERE -- YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES BUT THE FIRST PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF. AND WELCOME. MY NAME IS -- JESSE IDEA AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE SECURE JOURNEY HOUSE. WE ARE A DIRECT SERVICE ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS WITH FORMER FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA. DURING THE HIGHER EDUCATION. WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP INCLUDING HIS FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. AND EXPANSION OF CALIFORNIA'S CRUCIAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDERS. MENTAL HEALTH MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE FOUND. THAT LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS ARE EFFECTIVE A RECRUITING AND RETAINING PROFESSIONALS WITH PARTICIPANTS MORE LIKELY TO WORK IN UNDERSERVED AREAS IN THE LONG RUN. CURRENTLY THE LICENSE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE WRITER DUCATION FUND PROVIDES LONELY PAYMENTS OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO COMMIT TO SERVING A SHORTAGE AREA RELEASED TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY SIX OH EIGHT AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK STONE LAST YEAR. THERE'S NOW AN ACCOUNT WITHIN THE FUND -- YOUR MARK FUHRMAN TO HOLD WORKFORCE OF ONE APPROPRIATION OF THE LEGISLATURE. OUR REQUESTED A LINE TO THE GOVERNOR'S INTENT TO SHRINK IN THE STATE'S MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE BY SPECIFICALLY PROVIDING FORMER FOSTER YOUTH MEETING FOR OPPORTUNITIES. TO JOIN THE FEEL OF SOCIAL WORK AND MENTAL HEALTH AND TO GET BACK TO THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY COME FROM. SOCIAL WORKERS WERE IN FOR WHO WERE FUSSY THEMSELVES ARE LIKELY TO BE HIGHLY PATHETIC AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN SERVING THE POPULATION THEY ONCE WERE. IN FACT A REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BEANS AND DIRECTORS THE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK STATED THAT. CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN IS AN ESSENTIAL SKILL. TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SERVICE DELIVERY. THE MASTER PLAN FOR SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION THE STATE TELEPHONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LISTA CULTURAL SENSITIVITY. AS A NECESSARY SKILL SET. DUTCH THAT IS SHOWN TO IMPROVE THE LONG TERM SUCCESS OF YOUTH SERVED. WHAT MANY CALIFORNIA FOSTER THIS BAR TO GO TO COLLEGE JUST MORE THAN 50% GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL? APPROXIMATELY FOUR GRADUATE WITH A COLLEGE. GRADUATE COLLEGE WITH EVEN A SMALLER PERCENTAGE COMPLETED A MASTER'S OUR PEACH THE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THESE PROVIDE HOPE INCENTIVE. AND A PIPELINE OF SUPPORT TO FORMER FOSS YOUTH INTO MEANINGFUL CAREERS IN A LIFE OF SELF SUFFICIENCY. IN GENERAL -- WAGES AND HIGH DEGREE COSTS DISCOURAGE MANY PEOPLE FROM ENTERING SOCIAL WORK WITH TURNOVER RATES FOR SOCIAL WORKERS LOOKED. UP 75% IN SOME CALIFORNIA COUNTIES IT'S IN A COMMITTED PROVIDERS TO MEET THE GROWING NEEDS. WE URGE THE SUPPORT OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LOCATION INTO THE SUB FUND ESTABLISHED TO SUPPORT FORMER FOSTER YOUTH IN CAREERS. AS SOCIAL WORKERS AND MENTAL PROVIDERS. IN ORDER FOR THIS FUND TO BE FULLY UTILIZED. WE MUST INFORM FORMER FOSTER THE RUN THE STATE OF THEIR LEGIBILITY TO DELIVER IT AND MEANING FOR OUTRAGE. GIVEN THAT THERE WILL BE REAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCURRED DUE TO DEVELOPING MATERIALS AND CONDUCTING OUTREACH TO ENSURE FAUCET -- WHERE THIS PROGRAM WE SUGGEST CONSIDERATION OF AN INCREASE OF THE LEVEL OF THE PROPOSAL OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO ENSURE THE ADMINISTRATION? AND THE UTILIZATION OF THIS PROGRAM BE SUCCESSFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH ANY COMPANY OBSERVATION COMES FROM MUCH FUN OKAY LA L.. FINANCE RIGHT QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. RIGHT I A PRE APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION I GUESS I'M GOING TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS I DID ASK FOR THE REGIONAL BILL CAME THROUGH -- AND I RECOGNIZE THAT. IS A FIRST OF ALL CERTAINLY I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID THAT -- THAT FORMER FOSSE'S UNION BRING DOLLY UNIQUE BUT A VERY IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVES TO THE WORK. AS BEING SOCIAL WORKER SO WE WANT TO GIVE -- OF THE KIND OF SUPPORTS TO FOSTER USED TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WORK -- AND THEY'VE CERTAINLY BRING PERSONAL EXPERIENCE EFFECTIVE -- AS IN THOSE AND THAT ROLE -- AND A ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT PART OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IS THAT WELL -- AS THIS IS A REAL LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM THAT PERHAPS -- FOSTER USE ARE GOING AND PARTIALLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THERE'S PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO HELP PERHAPS HELP THEM PAY FOR THE TRAINING BUT I DO HAVE TO START OFF WITH SAYING LIKE HOW MANY FOSTER USE OUT THERE WHO ARE BECAUSE THIS IS A REAL LOAN PAYMENT WHO ARE ENTERING SOCIAL. AS WELL AS THE UNIVERSE OF OF OF PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THESE RIGHT NOW. WHO ARE OUT THERE AS SAID THAT -- WHO WHO DO WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM THE FUNDS AT LEAST AT THIS THAT AT THIS CURRENT TIME? YES SO -- INITIALLY IN IN OUR QUEST TO TRY TO TRACK DATA AND FIND REPORTS ON THE OUTCOMES OF FOSTER IN HIGHER EDUCATION -- WITH REGARDS TO IS -- GRADUATE SCHOOL THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO DATA -- WE WERE ABLE TO FIND THE PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS WHICH THE GARDENS PROFESSIONS PROGRAM -- THAT WAS A PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY TALK YOUTH WHO WERE TRANSFERRING INTO GRADUATE PROGRAMS AND WE WERE ABLE TO PULL THE DATA ABOUT THE USE THAT THE OF THE STUDENTS THAT THEY SERVE -- FROM FROM THE GUARDS PROFESSIONS PROGRAM -- AND SO WE ESTIMATED THE A SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR REQUEST. A BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS AT THE PROGRAM SERVED -- AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE A WE'RE GOING INTO SOCIAL WORK DEGREES WHICH BELIEVE WAS OF ROUGHLY OVER FORTY FIVE STUDENTS -- AND SO WE YOU KNOW BASED OUR ESTIMATE OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TOOT TOOT TO ME FIFTY UP POTENTIAL WORK OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW. AND I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE THOUGH IS THAT I MEAN. LAMBS IS RECREATE A SEPARATE FUND RIGHT BUT WE ALSO WE'RE PROPOSING VARIOUS FUNDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE TRAINING. AND SO FORTH AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT FAST YOU SPRING UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE. BUT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE NUMBER RIGHT AND ACTUALLY WE WANT TO INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS -- WOULD IT BE A BETTER STRATEGY TO SAY THAT ACTUALLY YOU -- IN THE LARGER FUNDS TO ACTUALLY GIVE PREFERENTIAL -- YOU KNOW -- IN STREET LAYOUT FOR BASICALLY PREFERENTIAL WHAT. DOES FOR FOSTER USE INSTEAD OF SCREENING A SEPARATE FUND WHERE WE'RE NOT SURE OF WHETHER IT'S CAN BE BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO BIG OR TOO SMALL AND CENTER AND SAY. YOU KNOW IN THE LARGER UNIVERSE OF MONEY WE'RE GONNA GIVE TOWARD MENTAL HEALTH WORK FOR SOME PEOPLE GOING INTO BEING YELP SOCIAL WORKERS OR OTHER TYPES OF POSITIONS. THAT WE IF YOU SAY THAT I WAS A FOSTER YOUTH YOU ACTUALLY GET THAT GIVES YOU A DEAL A PREFERENCE IN TERMS OF GETTING LOAN REPAYMENT OR SCHOLARSHIPS WATER ELSE -- AND THAT -- IS A WAY TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THE SAME AIM THAT YOUR THAT YOU'RE SEEKING. WELL I I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT -- YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY BILL -- TWENTY SIX WE DID ESTABLISH THE FUNDS WHAT IS IS THE STATE LAW -- END UP WITH REGARDS TO ADMINISTRATION HOW -- YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATORS OF THE PROGRAM'S WOULD ADMINISTERED DISTRIBUTING OR MAKING AWARDS I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A QUESTION MARK MORE APPROPRIATE FOR FOR COLLEGE OR ASPECTS. OF OKAY IN IS THAT POSSIBILITY -- DAMASCUS PERSPECTIVE THAT WE GIVE SOME PREFERENCE IN THE SCORING OR SOMETHING. TO PEOPLE FORMER FOSTER USE THAT MAKES SENSE -- IT'S IT'S WORTH A DISCUSSION I MEAN AFTER FIVE TO CONTINUE WITH THE OKAY SO SO. I'D SO I MADE IT IT'SFUN I'M SHARING IS IS THAT ONE IS IS THAT WE WANT TO GET. BY HELP FOSTER USE BECAUSE THAT FOR LOTS OF REASONS RIGHT NOW WE DO THE SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE THEY BRING AN EXPERIENCE. ALSO AS FAR ST THEY REALLY HAVE AS MAY RESOURCES RIGHT AND SO FORTH. AND ALSO WE ALSO WANT TO GET THE WORD OUT TO THE FAUCET YOU THAT THEY HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SO THAT TAKES SOME RESOURCES AS WELL SO WE CAN LAND SOMETHING AROUND THAT. OKAY WE HAVE WE HAVE SOME TIME TO WORK ON THAT. PERHAPS WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THAT OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU OKAY WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ANY OTHER QUESTIONS NOW OKAY THANK YOU. SO -- WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS IS -- TWO THREE FOUR AND THE I'M. AND THE S. STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL -- SO IF PEOPLE WANT TO COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE HERE [inaudible] WELCOME.

THE MORNING BRED IN UNISON THE CHIEF DEPUTY FOR OPERATIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. L. ANY PARTICULARLY -- FINANCE. ONLY BECAUSE HE FINANCE IT WE ARE ALMOST FINANCE OKAY SO WE'LL BE ABLE HE OVERVIEW AND THE STATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS STONE -- THE LA -- HAS REQUESTED THAT INSTEAD OF OUR DO THE PROVIDE A STATE OF THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH -- REPORT. HEARING FOR THIS HEARING I THOUGHT ABOUT THE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE IN PUBLIC HEALTH CONSIDER WHAT IS IMPORTANT -- PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUE AND SO I ASK STAFF FROM A VARIETY OF PROGRAMSTO GET TOGETHER AND PROVIDE YOU THIS THE HANDOUT THAT YOU WILL WHICH WHERE YOU WILL SEE THAT. THIS IS NOT BY ANY MEANS A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON THE STATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH BUT RATHER AN EXEMPLAR OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN CONSIDER THAT FROM -- HOW MUCH MORTALITY IS CAUSED BY GIVING CONDITION TO HOW MUCH PROMISE SURE OF IT EARLY DOUBTS THAT IT CAUSES -- THOSE THINGS THAT CAUSE GREATEST LEVELS OF DISABILITY OR NUMBER OF YEARS WITH DISABILITY. AND ALSO -- TO FOR US OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR THOSE CONDITIONS WHICH SHOW THE GREATEST DISPARITIES IN HEALTHDOT COMS. AND THEN FINALLY. SHEER NUMBERS OF CASES AS WE DO FROM FACTIONS DISEASES. TOM THEN AND ALSO WE CONSIDER EMERGING AND RE EMERGING DISEASES WHICH I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- CONDITIONS I AM IN A MOMENT TO COLLECTING AND ANALYZING DATA LIKE THIS AND TURNING IT INTO INFORMATION THAT CAN INFORM POLICY IN ACTION IS A FOUNDATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH'S. ACTIVITY PARTICULARLY AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND WITH CITY PH COLLECT MONITOR AND REPORT ON INCLUDING -- LEGISLATIVE REPORTS AND OTHER REPORTS THREE I WANT TO MENTION OF OF IMPORTANCE ARE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH STATUS PROFILES WHICH CONTAIN. A STATE AND COUNTY LEVEL DATA ON SPECIFIC INDICATORS RECOMMENDED BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND THE NATIONAL -- HEALTH THIS STATE IS THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS AND THIS REPORT PROVIDES BOTH PERCENTAGES BUT THEN RANKINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- FOR THOSE INDICATORS THAT ALSO HAVE HEALTHY PEOPLE -- TWENTY TWENTY OUTCOMES TO SHOW HOW THE STATE IS DOING AND IN REACHING THOSE DESIRED OUTCOMES WE ALSO DIRECTED MANAGE THEY LET'S GET HEALTHY CALIFORNIA THE STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. WHICH REPORTS ON SPECIFIC INDICATORS THAT ALIGN WITH HEALTH OUTCOME GOALS FOR COLLECTIVE IMPACT THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AND THEN FINALLY THE SECOND EDITION OF OUR BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASE REPORT WILL BE COMING OUT SHORTLY. BUT WE DON'T JUST GATHER DATA FOR DATA SAKE. THEY SAID WE REALLY WANT TO HELP SET PRIORITIES AND WE WANT TO DRIVE EFFECTIVE ACTION WE ALSO HAVE A FOCUS ON PREVENTION. AND THAT MEANS THAT WE DON'T JUST COLLECT THE INSTANCES OF CONDITIONS OR DISEASES BUT WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHO IS AFFECTED -- WHAT ARE THE THE THE THE BOTH A PHYSICAL BUT OFFICE ALSO TO THE INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY FACTORS THAT EITHER PUT SOMEONE AT RISK OR PROTECT THEM -- AND THAT SAME DATA THAT WE GATHER CAN ALSO BE USED TO EVALUATE THAT INTERVENTIONS THAT YOU PUT IN PLACE TO TRY TO PREVENT THESE DISEASES AND CONDITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS HEARING AND ALL THE LIMITED TIME FRAME OF WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS JUST -- PROVIDE A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHERE CALIFORNIA'S REALLY DOING WELL IN IMPROVING WHERE WE SING GOOD IMPROVEMENT BUT ALSO SEVERAL AREAS WHERE THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO POPULATION HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT I THINK IT MIGHT TAKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES -- ON THE VERY BROAD SCALE IT IN TERMS OF LIFE EXPECTANCY CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY SEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LIFE EXPECTANCY. IN NINETEEN NINETY WE RANK TWENTY FOURTH AMONG STATES WITH A AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF SEVENTY FIVE POINT NINE YEARS. ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA RANKS SECOND ONLY TO HAWAII WITH AN AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF ALMOST EIGHTY ONE YEARS SO SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN FACT THIS WAS THE GREATEST GAIN IN LIFE EXPENSES HE OF ANY STATE DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD. AND FOR CHRONIC DISEASES WE'VE SEEN -- FOR MANY OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES ARE THE DEATH RATES HAVE IMPROVED OVER TIME ID NUMBERS OF DEATHS ARE DECREASING BUT THEY DO REMAIN SOME OF THE MOST COMMON AND COSTLY -- CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT DUE TO CHRONIC DISEASES. I'M HEART DISEASE AND CANCER ALONE BECAUSE NEARLY 50% OF ALL DEATHS IN IN CALIFORNIA. SOMETHING THAT'S VERY WORRISOME FOR THE FUTURE IS THE FACT THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY SIX CALIFORNIA CHILDREN AND ONE IN EVERY THREE TEENS IS ALREADY OVER WEIGHT OR OBESE WHICH IS I SENT A STRONG RISK FACTOR FOR FUTURE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CANCER AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES. INCLUDING DIABETES IN FACT THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES IN CALIFORNIA'S INCREASED 34% BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN AND AS OF 2069% OF ALL CALIFORNIA ADULTS WHICH IS TWO POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES. AND AN ALARMING 46% OF ALL ADULTS ARE THIRTEEN MILLION HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH THAT WITH PRE DIABETES WITHOUT INTERVENTION ON AVERAGE ONE OUT OF FOUR OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL GO ON TO DEVELOP DIABETES. RATES OF DIABETES ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY GEOGRAPHICALLY IN CALIFORNIA AS DO MANY OF THESE IMPORTANT TO CONDITIONS THE RATE IN IMPERIAL COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE IS THE HIGHEST AT FOURTEEN POINT AND ITS LOWEST IN MARIN COUNTY WITH WO POINT 6% QUITE A QUITE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. AND DIABETES IS ALSO DISEASE WHERE WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. DIABETES RATES AMONG WHITES IS ART 7% AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS AND RICHARD THREE TIMES HIGHER AMONG PEOPLE FROM HIGH SCHOOL THAN THOSE THAT HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE AND TWICE AS HIGH IN FAMILIES THAT ARE LIVING UNDER THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL ALL OF WHICH OF FACT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO BE HEALTHY. WE'VE SEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS -- IN MANY CHRONIC DISEASES INCLUDING CANCER HEART DISEASE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND STROKE EACH OF WHICH RATES HAVE DECREASED -- AND THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF FACTORS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS THING AND NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH WOULD BE THE EXPANSION OF HIGH QUALITY. HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS WELL AS PREVENTIVE SERVICES BUT CALIFORNIA'S ALSO MADE IMPORTANT POLICY CHANGES THAT HAVE HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT. AND A GOOD EXAMPLE IS SMOKING SMOKING REMAINS A LEADING CAUSE OF PREMATURE DEATH DISEASE AND DISABILITY EVEN THOUGH DEATHS FROM LUNG CANCER BEEN DECREASING FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS -- THAT BUT CHANGES IN POLICY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACTIVE IN CALIFORNIA BOTH AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL AS PRIVATE HEALTH PREVENTION WORK HAVE HAD A HUGE IMPACT. CALIFORNIA SMOKING RATES HAVE DECREASED 54% -- IN ADULTS DOWN TO TEN POINT 1% AND FOUR POINT 3% IN SCHOOL YOUTH. AND BY TWENTY FOURTEEN LUNG CANCER MORTALITY IN CALIFORNIA HAD DROPPED 43% AND WAS 30% LOWER THAN THE REST OF THE NATION HIS ARE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS. WHEN I TURN TO SOME EMERGING ISSUES THAT I THINK DESERVE ATTENTION OPIATES AS YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY DOCTOR PAN ARE -- DRUGS TYPICALLY USED FOR PAIN RELIEF SUCH AS CODEINE HYDROCODONE IN FRONT NOW. DESPITE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL RATE OF OPIOID DISSOCIATED OVERDOSING DUST IS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THAT NATIONAL RATE WE STILL HAVE NEARLY TWO THOUSAND OVER OPIATE OVERDOSE DEATHS EVERY YEAR AND APPROXIMATELY EIGHT THOUSAND HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS. AS WELL AS OVER TWENTY FOUR MILLION FIRST IN CALIFORNIA TO EAST CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. LIKE THE NATION AND WE HAVE BEEN BATTLING OPIOID. INCREASED YEAR PERIOD YOU SAID MISUSE FOR OVER A DECADE THE RECENT SHARP INCREASE THAT IS YET GARNERED SO MUCH ATTENTION IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF UNCHECKED AND POORLY UNDERSTOOD PER PRESCRIPTION PAIN MANAGEMENT. AND WE HAD EARLY SUCCESSES IN DEATH RATES TO PER PRESCRIPTION ASSOCIATED OF THE OVERDOSES. HOWEVER IN RECENT YEARS DESPITE THOSE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS -- WE HAVE SEEN THE EPIDEMIC SHIFT INCREASINGLY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ILLICIT DRUG USE INCLUDING HEROIN AND FUNCTIONAL. BUT WE DID WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS -- RISING RATES DO YOU HAVE DECREASED SHARPLY SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN AND PRESCRIPTION OPIOID ASSOCIATED DEATHS RACHED THEIR LOWEST LEVEL IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN HOWEVER HEROIN RELATED OVERDOSED US OF INCREASED 97% SINCE TWENTY TWELVE AND FENNEL RELATED DEATHS HAVE INCREASED FOUR HUNDRED AND THERE IS ALSO WHY GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN THE IMPACT OF OF OPIOID CRISIS WITH OUR NORTHERN RURAL COUNTIES BY HAVING SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER RATES. OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES AND OF COURSE ARE ARE A POPULOUS SOUTHERN COUNTIES HAVE THIS THE LARGEST NUMBERS. SUICIDE IS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING CIRCLE SUICIDE RATES HAVE DECLINED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES BUT HAVE INCREASED IN THE MOST RECENT DECADES. AND ARE NOW DOUBLE THE HOMICIDE RATES TO SITE ACCOUNTS FOR NEARLY TWICE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS STATEWIDE AS OPIOIDS OR HOMICIDES. AND IS ONE OF THE TOP TEN CAUSES OF PREMATURE DEATH IN CALIFORNIA. MAN COMMITS SUICIDE AT THREE TIMES THE RATE OF WOMEN THAT ARE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO USE A FIREARM. AND WHILE THE HIGHEST RATES ARE AMONG MALES OVER EIGHTY SUICIDE IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS AGED. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MANY OF THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT SEE HIGH RATES OF OPIOID OVERDOSE THE NORTHERN COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE ALSO EXPERIENCE SUICIDE RATES SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE STATE WIDE RATE. AND THEN FINALLY I WANT TO TALK A BIT ABOUT THE RAPID RISE AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES ACROSS THE STATE. OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES OF STDS WERE REPORTED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN UP 45% FROM JUST FIVE YEARS AGO. AND OF GREATEST CONCERN TO MANY IS THE RESURGENCE OF THE ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE CONDITION OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING AT LEAST 70% OF POTENTIAL CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASES THROUGH DETECTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT. THERE WERE STILL TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE CASES SYPHILIS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THIRTY CIVIL DISASSOCIATED STILLBIRTH THAT'S THE HIGHEST IN TWENTY YEARS. MOST OF THE WOMEN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO BABIES WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN DID NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE OR TIMELY PRENATAL CARE WHICH COULD HAVE PREVENTED TRANSMISSION. THE MOST COMMON MATERNAL RISK FACTORS WERE SUBSTANCE USE HOMELESSNESS EXCHANGE OF SEX FOR MONEY OR DRUGS AND CONTACT WITH THE JAIL SYSTEM. STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM AT FIRST BLUSH FATAL UNKNOWN NONFATAL OPIOID DOSES SUICIDE AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES SHARE MANY OF THE SAME ROOT CAUSES. AND THEY ARE INCREASING DESPITE OUR PROGRESS IN HAVING ME EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND IN LARGE PART THIS IS BECAUSE THESE AREN'T JUST DISEASES OF PEOPLE BUT THERE DISEASES OF COMMUNITIES AND SOCIETY. AND THERE ARE RISING IN A TIME WHEN INCREASING NUMBERS OF PEOPLE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO AFFORD THE BASIC COST OF LIVING LIKE HEALTHY. FOOD AND STABLE HOUSING. HOPELESSNESS AND DESPAIR ARE COMMON SYMPTOMS ACROSS EACH OF THESE CONDITIONS. AND THEY ARE ALSO RISE THEY HAVE ALSO HAVE THE WRITTEN ADVERSE EXPERIENCES IN CHILDHOOD SUCH AS POVERTY VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA. AND STICK MY REMAINS A POWERFUL BERRIER TO SEEKING CARE. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO REFLECT AN INCREASING RELIANCE ON HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT'S IT ALONE CAN'T FIX THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY TREAT THE SYMPTOMS AND NOT THE ROOT CAUSES. TO ALTERNATELY FOR US TO ADDRESS THESE AND OTHER DISEASES OF DESPAIR WE WILL NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM OF PREVENTION THAT ADDRESSES. THOSE REAP ROOT CAUSES LIKE POVERTY HOMELESSNESS AND VIOLENCE AND A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT CAN PROVIDE TREATMENT FREE OF BIAS AND STIGMA AND THAT RECOGNIZES THE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH ARE AS INTEGRAL TO THE PERSON'S WELL BEING AS PHYSICAL HEALTH. MAKING SIGNIFICANT STATE SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO REQUIRE THAT WE HAVE A MUCH GREATER UNDERSTANDING. HOW THESE SOCIAL PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS INTERACT? AND FIGURING OUT WHICH LEVERS WE CAN USE EFFECTIVELY TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN A HEALTHY AND RESILIENT CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. QUESTIONS BE MEMBERS THURSTONE WHILE ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THAT WAS -- QUITE A QUITE AN EDUCATION FOR ME AND WE CERTAINLY SEEN -- IN MY COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY WE'VE SEEN A SURGE OF OF SYPHILIS AND GONORRHEA SO I I JUST. WE NEED TO OBVIOUSLY GET OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND TO HEDGE KATE -- OUR POPULATION THAT THE OF THE USER. TREATABLE DISEASES THEY CAN BE PREVENTED WITH APPROPRIATE -- PROTECTIONS -- INSERTED THE CONGENITAL SURPLUSES IS A MAJOR. ISSUE FOR US TO DEAL WITH. I ALSO -- SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT CHILDHOOD OBESITY IN THE IN THE HIGHER INCIDENCE OF OF DIABETES THAT WERE SAYING. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT TODAY WE DON'T SEE THE ATHLETIC PROGRAMS THAT WE DID WHEN I WAS A KID YOU KNOW TODAY KIDS ARE YOU KNOW. PROPERTY BUT MAY BE A LOT OF JUNK FOODS WHICH I DO AND SHOULDN'T -- BUT YOU KNOW WE USED TO BURN IT OFF YOU KNOW WE STEP P. PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASS AND WE USED TO HAVE. INTRAMURAL SPORTS AND WE USED. TO PLAY IN. WE GOT HOME AFTER DINNER WE WERE TO GO TO THAT WE'RE TIRED AFTER ALL THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WE NEED SOMEHOW ANOTHER STRUCTURED YOUR YOUR YOUR PERVIOUS. WE NEED TO SOMEHOW ENCOURAGE MORE -- CARDIOVASCULAR. STIMULATION WITHIN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM IN AND BRING BACK -- MORE ACTIVE RECREATION AND SPORTS -- AND I KNOW MANY IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE BUT YEAH WE JUST AND HAVE A CHILDHOOD OBESITY PROBLEMS THAT WE DID. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND CERTAINLY THE COMPUTER GENERATION IN THE ONLINE GAMING IS ARE ALSO PLAYED A ROLE IN THE THAT THE STATIC ACTIVITY OF OF PEOPLE -- ANOTHER ISSUE PRODUCT THAT -- IS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME IS THE THE SUICIDE RATE TO AND YOUNG CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS. AND THAT YOU ALSO BROUGHT UP -- ON AN ALARMING STATISTIC TO WITH THE THE NUMBER PH&lt;c.cyan&gt; N&lt;/c&gt; OVERDOSES OVERSEEING ANDIN THE IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE -- MAYBE SOMEBODY'S ARE CLASSIFIED A SUICIDES BUT MANY OF THEM ARE JUST MISTAKENLY INTERACTING WITH A THINK IT'S HER WHEN AND IT IS FOUNTAIN ALL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF A PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM WE CAN HAVE TO THOSE THAT ARE UNFORTUNATELY CAUGHT UP IN THIS WILL BE A CRISIS. THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT YOU KNOW BE WHERE WHICH ARE INJECTING MEANING MAYBE MUCH STRONGER THAN WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE INJECTING AND COULD CLAIM YOUR LIFE AND WE JUST HAD A FAMILY MEMBER -- MY SON WHO'S ONE OF HIS CORPORATE FRIENDS CAME FROM. YOU KNOW A VERY VERY GOOD BEGINNINGS AND WENT TO SCHOOL. GOT CAUGHT UP INTOXICATION SO WAS VERY VERY DISTURBING. SO -- ALSO -- IMAGINE A 50% OF THE DEATHS AND CITY CALIFORNIA ARE DUE -- TO CARDIAC -- ISSUES AND AND CANCER ISSUES. A CERTAINLY -- WE CAN EFFECTUATE -- YOU KNOW MUCH MORE -- HEALTHY LIVING -- WHICH WILL HELP A LOT NOT ONLY WITH THE DIABETES THAT WE MENTIONED BEFORE BUT ALSO PREVENT HEART DISEASE BY BREAK -- TO MODERN BUT PRESSURES. BECAUSE A PROMISE KEEPER SO BUSY WITH OUR LIVES HELL TO GET DIAGNOSED WITH NEXT THING YOU KNOW THE THIRD HOUSE BUT WITH A STROKE OR A HEART ATTACK AT A VERY YOUNG AGE IN AMERICA NO LEAD A VERY. CHALLENGING LIFE -- AS WE KNOW THAT HEART MUSCLE DOESN'T -- REALLY WE TO REGENERATE VERY MUCH AFTER ITS DAMAGE SO -- I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF OF PEOPLE THAT. ARE -- SUCCUMBING TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES YOU KNOW AGAIN CHILD SUICIDE TO CANCER -- WE CAN'T DO A WHOLE LOT ABOUT OTHER THAN TO PROMOTE YOU KNOW SELF BREAST EXAM AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ARE. OF COURSE -- EMBRACED BY MANY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS BUT HOW DO WE GET TO THE COULD THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE PART I MEAN AT THE THE CONNERY AND A SURPLUS THAT IS JUST OFF THE CHARTS. IN MY COUNTY WHAT KIND OF A BETTER EDUCATION PROGRAM -- DO WE NEED. TO MAYBE NOT REINVENT I MEAN IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DID YOU KNOW. DECADES AGO BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT WAS THIS SEEMS TO BECOMING AN EPIDEMIC CAM IT IS AN EPIDEMIC THAT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY COMPLICATED AND IT WHICH IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE SEVERAL STRATEGIES. THE SINGLE STRONGEST RISK FACTOR -- FOR FOR EXAMPLE FOR SYPHILIS IS ACTUALLY METHAMPHETAMINE USE AND SO THERE'S A WE HAVE CINDA MAKES GOING ON AS WE LIKE TO CALL TWO EPIDEMICS OF TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY OR MORE THAN TWO IN THIS CASE. THAT ARE PERPETUATING EACH OTHER AND SAY -- IT IN THERE AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE BARE AND WE'LL JUST STICK WITH WOMEN WITH SYPHILIS JUST IT THERE IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHICH POPULATION BUT FOR EXAMPLE -- WOMEN WHO DO USE SUBSTANCES METHAMPHETAMINE IN PARTICULAR IS VERY COMMON IT REALLY REMOVES INHIBITIONS WOMEN MAY -- USE SEX TO FOR PROVIDE HOUSING TO BRIBE FOOD ETCETERA SAFETY AND SO AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE -- BARRIERS TO SEEKING CARE AND IN PARTICULAR SEEKING -- PRENATAL CARE -- THERE ARE MANY WOMEN WHO TOLD US THAT THEY DON'T GO IN TO SEE THE DOCTOR BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF CHILD WELFARE SERVICES AND YOU KNOW SO THERE'S A THERE'S A WE NEED TO KIND OF THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT OUR APPROACH -- TO THESE WOMEN IN ORDER TO GET THEM INTO CARE THAT IS SUPPORTED SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE TREATMENT WHAT'S SO FRUSTRATING ABOUT THESE IS THAT THEY ARE PREVENTABLE. AND THEN OF YOU KNOW FINDING OPPORTUNITY ONE OF THE OTHER -- REALLY SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTIONS THEY PROVIDE CONDOMS THEY DO A LOT OF INTERVENTION WITH FOLKS WHERE THEY'RE OUT AND EXPLAINING THE SITUATION TO THEM TOO SO. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON AND WE'RE WE'RE MODESTLY OPTIMISTIC BUT AT HEART. WE REALLY DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH HOMELESSNESS SINCE THE SUBSTANCE USE THAT THAT INCREASES HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE SOCIAL ISSUES ARE SO TIGHTLY TIED UP WITH THESE -- THESE PHYSICAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT -- TO NOT ADDRESS THEM AT THE SAME TIME AND BE SUCCESSFUL. WELL YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT -- YOU KNOW A WOMAN THE GOES IN THAT TO BE TREATED AND WITH METHAMPHETAMINE -- ISSUES SYPHILIS. SHE'S AND SHE'S AFRAID ALL MY GOSH I'M GOING THERE NO ONE OF MY KIDS TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE THEY SEE ME HAVING SOME. RISKY LIFESTYLE ISSUES WITH -- AYE AYE WHICH WAS A WAY WE CAN. HE'S THAT CONCERNED I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT BECAUSE CERTAIN MANDATED LAWS THAT YOU HAVE TO REPORT CERTAIN THINGS. ALL THE OTHERS HAVE WHICH WORKS ON OUR SIDE AS WELL SO I GRAVITY IS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN HAVE THE FREEDOM TO GET IN TO GET CARE -- WITHOUT THE THE FEAR THAT SOMEBODY'S GOING TO TAKE THEIR KIDS AWAY AND AND AND COME AFTER THEM SO HAPPY TO TALK FURTHER ABOUT THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT PRESENTATION. ALL THANK YOU -- AND DOES SOMEONE WITH A BACKGROUND PUBLIC CULTIVOS APPRECIATES -- THE PRESENTATION. I'M ALSO THINKING THAT WHILE YOU'RE PRESENTING THIS TO OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE -- MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING OUR HEALTH COMMITTEE SHOULD HERE'S WELL -- AND SO -- THE BUT FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT -- IN A MONTH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OF THIS THIS GETS DOWN TO THE SOCIAL TERMS HEALTH IN MANY WAYS WE THINK ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WHERE NOT ONLY DEALING WITH. PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THREE AMERICA ON SOME OTHERS BUT WE ALSO OVERSEE THE PARMA SOCIAL SERVICES AND SO WE ARE AT LEAST -- FOUR WE'RE LOOKING A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT SERVICES THE STATE PROVIDES THAT ALSO IMPACT SOCIAL TERM ITSELF NOW THERE'S A IT'S A TWO CATION ENVIRONMENT SO FORTH THAT MIKE GUY COLLEAGUES ARE ALSO THERE ARE ALSO IMPORTANT ELEMENTS -- YEAH WELL IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THAT WERE ISSUE OF OF A BEING HAS CONTINUED CONCERN IS SOCIALLY SISTERS EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT IT CAN BECOME A GATEWAY. TO SMOKING -- SO THERE'S BEEN SOME DEBATE ABOUT. THE BEING SEE FOR NOT SMOKING BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WITH THE SPECIALLY WITH USE WHO MAY BE INTRODUCED -- TO NICOTINE BY BEATING THAT THE MORE LIKELY TO PROGRESS AND TO SMOKING ITSELF SO WHATEVER COMMENTS TO MAKE ABOUT HOUSE A FEEDING ITSELF IS IN SOME OF THE BACK AND FORTH ON THAT -- AND THEN ACTUALLY ALSO EXPOSURE TO MARIJUANA A THAT YOU KNOW THE VOTERS SPOKE THERE WAS THE EAGLE REGULATE FOR ADULTS. BUT ALSO THERE'S BEEN INDICATIONS THAT THE SAME BABY DEVICES I INTRODUCED PEOPLE TH TOBACCO CAN ALSO INTRODUCE THEM TO CANCEL ITS. AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON THAT WASN'T -- BRAINS AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL HAVE TO TO TO MODERN NOW TALKING ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE ACTUALLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HEARING OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE SELF ALL THE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS -- AND ACTUALLY SIR STONE IS MY NOT ONLY MY WING MAN HERE AND THIS -- SUBCOMMITTEE BUT ALSO ON THE HEALTH COMMITTEE ACCESS TO TREATMENT BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED THAT. YES THERE WAS A ROLL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PLAYED IN TERMS OF OF BIRTH POTENTIALLY OVER PRESCRIBING -- OPIATES AND BUT IT'S NOW SHIFTED MORE TO A THE LIST USE AND AND FRANKLY. WHAT WE CAN'T DO IS AS AS MUCH AS FOR SO OF COURSE YOU WANT FEWER PEOPLE TO TAKE BECOME ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS AND TO TO ENTER THAT PIPELINE -- BUT WE ALSO CAN'T A BAND THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTY ALREADY THERE AND SO TO BE SURE THAT HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND WHAT ARE WE DOING IN THAT REGARD SO WHY THAT'S ONLY GOING TO BE A SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS AS LOOKING TO ADDRESS AND IN. THAT ISSUE AND THEN -- STDS WERE ACTUALLY HAVING A HEARING NEXT WEEK -- THE HEALTH COMMITTEE ON THAT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. AND I WOULD MAKE NO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH IT TODAY BUT I THINK THE LAST BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE I DID CHALLENGE -- YOUR DEPARTMENT TO TELL IT TO COME BACK TO SAY WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES NECESSARY TO REBUILD OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN MANY WAYS. OUR IN OUR STATE AND COUNTIES MADE BE SURE TO PROTECTS THAT DIRECT SERVICES FOR MANY PEOPLE AT GREAT NEEDS -- BUT WE HAVEN'T REALLY I THINK RESTORED THAT INFRASTRUCTURE YET AND THAT'S TO INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NOT ONLY DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE CHRONIC CONDITIONS BUT ALSO WITH -- EMERGING -- DISEASES AS WELL AND WE TALK ABOUT STDS. I MEAN THEY'RE NOT. BUT THE CELTIC ANY OF THEM ARE NEW EMERGING DISEASES AT THE MOMENT OR MULTI DRUG RESISTANT GONORRHEA THAT'S TRUE MULTI DRUG RESISTANT GOT AND NOT JUST THE STANDARD GONORRHEA ANYMORE -- SO YOU KNOW WE WE NEED TO GET WE NEED TO BE SURE WE GET THAT INFRASTRUCTURE UP AND DEATH AND SO CLEARLY -- THAT -- FATHER CERTAINLY MANY SOCIAL DETERMINES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THE THE CLIENT AT INFRASTRUCTURE -- IS SOMETHING THAT -- CERTAINLY IS LEADING -- TO THIS GROWTH AND STDS. THINKING ABOUT SURPLUS AND WE THOUGHT WE BEAT THAT BACK IN THE VICTORIAN ERA I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHEN IT STOPPED ONLY FINALLY THE PENICILLIN FROM THE EVENT HAS SOMEONE THAT REALLY KILLED THOSE BILLS PARAKEETS AND I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE WITH THAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE THAT'S BACK. LIKELY EVEN ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE WORD THOSE THINGS AND GET CAUGHT SO AS THERE'S THIS DEBATE ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ACCESS. THAT DOES HAVE IMPLICATIONS A SOMEONE IS ACTUALLY SPENT SOMETIME WORKING AT STD CLINIC AND AND TRIUMPH AND THEN -- THEY'LL INVOLVED WITH OKAY CONTACT TRACING AND ALL THIS OTHER ACTIVITIES PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES. THAT TAKE PLACE -- HILL SUICIDE MENTAL HEALTH AGAIN -- SOMETHING THAT -- WE'RE ALSO -- WE'RE HAVING ACTUALLY JUST HAD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING ABOUT THAT LAST WEEK WE'RE DOING PART TWO NEXT WEEK SO -- THEIR JOINT HEALTH COMMITTEES INCLUDE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE SO AGAIN LOOKING AT THESE -- THESE ISSUES -- AND ALSO HOW TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH FOR FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT OF COURSE -- SITES NOT JUST YOUNG PEOPLE -- BUT ACROSS THE SPECTRUM I ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT YOU MENTIONED 46% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE PRE DIABETIC. I I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT WHEN YOU'RE QUOTING SOME YEAH I A SAID WHAT WE HAVE THE NUMBERS I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GET TO KNOW I I GOT IT BUT YEAH YEAH BUT I SAW A BIG NOTE FOR EXAMPLE -- THE SCREENING FOR ATI IT ACTUALLY IT IS AT A LOW RUBIO BY. THAN IT IS FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION BECAUSE WE TEND TO HIGH WE TEND TO HIGHER FAT BETTER I GUESS. AND SO BUT THE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT RIGHT SO SOMETIMES THAT GETS UNDERESTIMATE BECAUSE CLINICIANS ARE USING DIFFERENT BMI A LOWER BMI FOR THE API COMMUNITY -- BUT AS YOU MENTIONED ONE FOURTH OF THESE PRE DIABETICS WE DON'T DO ANYTHING WILL ADVANCE THE DIABETES AND THAT'S TREMENDOUS WE WILL EVENTUALLY GET THAT THE PART HEALTHCARE SERVICES AMERICA I MEAN THAT'S A TREMENDOUS FUTURE COST. AND IN FACT LAST YEAR I THINK WAS LAST YEAR WE STARTED PUSHING FOR THE PILOT FUNDINGBUT I THINK WE NEED TO THINK MORE BROADLY ABOUT THE BRING IT TO SCALE. IT READ JUST LIKE THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAMS -- THAT'S AN INTERVENTION THAT'S BEEN VERY WELL EVALUATED SO IT'S NOT JUST LIKE I THINK THIS IS GOING TO HELP IT'S BEEN EVALUATED UP YEAH YO RANDOMIZED CONTROL STUDIES. SHOWS REDUCE THE MOVEMENT FROM PRE DAVIES DIABETES ABOUT ALMOST BY HALF ABOUT FORTY A THINK 47% IS FOR SIX OBSERVERS THAT. VERY SUCCESSFUL. SO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 46% A QUARTER THOSE WE DON'T DO ANYTHING SO THAT'S NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW 1112% OF THOSE PEOPLE BECOMING OF THE WHOLE POPULATION BEGIN DIABETIC. THE FACT THAT WE CAN CUT THAT FROM THAT TO MAYBE DOWN THE FIVE OR 6% YOU KNOW WITH WE DO THIS. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A LOT OF NIGHTS OUT BUT IT DOES REQUIRE SOME FUNNY UP FRONT SO WE REALLY DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT THOSE KIND OF VESTMENTS AS WE'RE TALKING. TO OTHER AGENCIES AS WELL AS YOU'RE PRESENTING THE DATA SAYING WHAT CAN WE DO. THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT JUST THE MONEY IT'S THE LIFE DIABETES IS THAT WILL MANAGE TO THE THIS EYESIGHT ILLUSION LIMBS. ETCETERA -- AND THEN OF COURSE SO -- SO THERE CERTAINLY SO MUCH MORE TO DO AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE THE PRESENTATION -- BUT ALSO YOU KNOW WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO STRENGTHEN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE -- SO AND ALSO DATA COLLECTION SO WE ARE WHERE THAT'S HOW WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING AND ALSO WHETHER MAKING A DIFFERENCE RIGHT ANYTHING ANY TYPE OF AND WE'LL PUT MONEY AND I'VE FOUND SOME OTHER FOLKS ARE EARLIER WILL GET THAT MONEY IN SOMETHING WHAT WE CAN EXPECT THE RESULT. FROM THAT. THE WELL CELL. OKAY SO WELL WE'LL JUST MOVE MAYBE ON TO SELL ITS TERMS OF THE OVERALL BUDGET PART -- I JUST -- I ALWAYS LIKE TO KEEP ALWAYS LIKE TO MAKE NOTE THAT -- THE BUDGET FOR THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH IT'S IT'S ABOUT. INOUTS THREE AT A FOUND THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS RATE. JUST ABOUT LITTLE BIT OF JUST ABOUT. THAT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT THE GENERAL FUND. OF THE BUDGET BOTH PROPOSES ONLY A HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION CELLS VAST MAJORITY OF THIS COMES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM -- ALSO -- A SPECIAL FUNDS AND THE SO -- AS WE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS IN DC AND FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES THAT HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH HERE IN CALIFORNIA SINCE THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THOSE RESOURCESCOME FROM. BUT OF COURSE WE ALSO WON'T BE SURE WE'RE PROVIDING SUFFICIENT GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR THOSE CORE FUNCTIONS THAT -- ARE NOT FUNDED BY ABOUT WHETHER IT'S THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR FROM OUR SPECIAL FUNDS AS WELL. SO I JUST WANT. TO MAKE ALWAYS MAKE MENTION OF THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT THREE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET -- SO -- WITH THAT -- DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SURF COMMENTS ON THE SERVE THE OVERALL BUDGET A REVIEW. BAILEY OKAY LA -- COMMENTS ON THE OVER OF PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGET FINANCE NOW. MORE MONEY. OKAY IT ALL RIGHT. OKAY WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT ALL THESE PROBLEMS ALL RIGHT -- OKAY -- RIGHT NOW I KNOW THAT -- YEAH WE HAVE IT AND WE DO HAVE IN THE DESCRIPTION IN ADDITION TO THE STATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE OF THE SEVEN SEVEN MAJOR PROGRAM AREAS SO FOR PEOPLE WANT TO READ O THEIR OUT.

AND TO ADDRESS THINGS LIKE CHRONIC DISEASES AND STDS AND SO FORTH BUT ALSO OFTEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE FUNDING IS REALLY CONSTRAINTS WE APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT -- AND THEN IN TERMS OF CHRONIC DISEASES I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR CHRONIC DISEASE IN OUR STATE. AND SO OFTEN TIMES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE PIECING TOGETHER A LOT OF THE GRANT FUNDING **** OR DIFFERENT POCKETS OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS -- BUT THERE'S NOT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THATAND WE MADE HUGE STRIDES ON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE -- BUT WE REALLY THINK THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO TO START FOCUSING ON PREVENTION AND HOW WE CAN AVOID SOME OF THE COSTS DOWN THE ROAD TO THIS. OKAY THANK YOU ANDI WOULD ALSO JUST MAKE NOTE HOW IMPORTANT ARE COUNTY -- HEALTH OFFICERS AND COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT IS JUST DONE AT THE STATE I MEAN WITHOUT THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND HEALTH OFFICERS SO WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE -- TO MAKE ANY OF THIS HAPPEN I WOULD ALSO JUST -- PERHAPS IF NEGLECTED TO MAKE NOTE I NOTICED HERE THAT -- SO CERTAINLY THE OPIOID CRISIS IS A THAT IS AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT MORE PEOPLE DIED LAST YEAR FROM INFLUENZA. THEN DIED OF OPIOID OVERDOSE DOESN'T MEAN THAT OPIATE OVERDOSE IS ANY LESS IMPORTANT -- BUT WEEKS OR SOME VERY BASIC THINGS WE CAN DO LIKE IT PEOPLE VACCINATED. AND SAVE LIVES SO -- DOWN OF A THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER PEOPLE DIED OF INFLUENZA LAST YEAR -- AND OTHER TYPES OF DISEASES AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE THEM A DISTANT MEMORY SO WITH THAT -- LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ISSUES SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GO THROUGH ISSUES TWO THROUGH THIRTEEN AND THEN WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS --% AFTER THAT ON ON THOSE.

WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNITY WATER FLUORIDATION WITH PRIORITIZE EXISTING WATER SYSTEMS REQUIRING EQUIPMENT UPGRADE. AND SYSTEMS THAT HAVE THE NECESSARY APPROVALS TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH RESPECT TO INTERVENTIONS IN SCHOOLS. I MADE A PRIORITY THAT ALL. LOCAL HOW JURISDICTION SHOULD ENCOURAGE KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN TO SEE EVEN ASSESSMENT BEFORE ENTERING FIRST GRADE. OUR GOAL IS. TO DELIVER HELD THE CHILDREN TO SCHOOLS -- BY PROMOTING THE KINDERGARTEN OR HOW TO SUSMAN POLICY THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LINK A LARGE PROPORTION OF CHILDREN TO SOURCE OF DENTAL CARE AND ESTABLISH A DENTAL FONG. THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS PARTNERED WITH DISSENT SENTENCES GO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND A LOCAL DOWN SOCIETY TO SCREEN. ALL FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN AND LINK THE SCREEN SCHOOL SCREENING TO TEN ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THE SAYS IMPROVE THE ORAL HEALTH OF KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN AS EVIDENCED BY THE DECLINE IN THE PREVALENCE OF TOOTH DECAY FROM ABOUT 60% IN TWO THOUSAND ONE TO ABOUT 32% IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SAN FRANCISCO FOCUSED THEIR EFFORTS ON ONE TWO FIVE YEAR OLD CHILDREN TO BRING ABOUT THIS CHANGE.

WE HAVE INTERVIEWED MANY PROGRAMS OPERATED BY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS. LOCAL HOW DEPARTMENTS DENTISTS AND DENTAL HYGIENISTS TO UNDERSTAND THAT MODEL REVENUE STREAMS AND CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. SO IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO BRING THESE PROGRAMS TOGETHER AND CREATE A LEARNING COMMUNITY. CURRENTLY LOCAL HOW JURISDICTIONS ARE IDENTIFYING EXISTING PROGRAMS AND GAPS IN INTERVENTIONS IN SCHOOLS. ASSESSING THE BIT BILLING THIS OF SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE. AND THE DIRECT ESTIMATING THAT EQUIPMENT NEEDS AND IDENTIFYING PROVIDERS HO ARE INTERESTED IN PROVIDING SERVICES AND SCHOOLS. SO THE GREATEST NEED. NOW IS TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE MODELS. THAT CAN SUIT INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF SCHOOLS. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE USE UCSF DOWN SCHOOL TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND TRAINING TO LOCAL HEALTH PROGRAMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALCHEMIST FAMILIAL FINANCE. ALRIGHT SO APPRECIATE -- VALUE PRESENTATION AS VERY THOROUGH -- THE THE TERMS OF THE PROP FIFTY SIX REVENUE DECLINING -- I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK -- MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FINANCED THROUGH -- TO BACK REVENUES HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOUSAND FIRST FIVE COMMISSION SACRAMENTO -- BILL WE WE WHAT WE TRIED TO DO IS HOW WE WOULD DO SUSTAIN LACY OF AND NOT UNUSUAL WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH STATE BUDGET TO WRITE SO THINK ABOUT ONE TIME EXPENDITURES FOR EXAMPLE FLIRTATION EQUIPMENT WOULD BE. ONE I ONE TIME RIGHT THAT THE CITY OR WHATEVER AGENCY WOULD. CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE EQUIPMENT -- THEN YOU HAVE JOHN GOING PROGRAMS AND IS THERE SOME THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. IN TERMS OF PROJECTING OUT TO THE FUTURE GIVEN THE THE AND WE WANT FEWER PEOPLE SMOKE SCIENCE A GOOD THING RIGHT I MEAN IT'S THAT THE MONEY IS NICE BUT ULTIMATELY THE MAIN GOAL IS TO GET FEWER PEOPLE SMOKE -- AT THAT -- IN TERMS OF BEING OUT SUSTAIN CERTAIN PROGRAMS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THAT YOU IS THAT YOU WOULD BUILD UP LIFT SAMPLE. BUILD A LITTLE BIT RESERVE THAT COULD EVEL THINGS OUT OVER TIME INSTEAD OF IS PUSHING IT ALL OUT AND THEN HAVING TO CUT CUT CUT -- SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION AS TO AS YOUR STRATEGIZING AYE YOUR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT THE AND LOOKING FINE IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO BE PART OF THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION ABOUT OKAY THIS IS IT DOES WALL HOW WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IT IN A WAY THAT. MEETS THE GOALS OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SO SURE THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE EFFORTS RIGHT THAT YOU'RE PUTTING OUT AS YOU'RE WORKING WITH YOUR VARIOUS COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND LOCAL PARTNERS AS WELL. EXHAUSTION HERE FROM YOUR NON PROFITS WHAT THE FILM ACTUALLY SERVER USEFUL AT MY IT GOES UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN RIGHT THAT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO A SUSTAINED EFFORT THEY HAVE TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN WORK FORCE AT CETERA SO. IT'S IT'S THAT SOME OF THE AS STEP AND FOR SOME OF THE DISCUSSION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT -- SOME OF THIS -- COMES RELATED TO THE PROP FIFTY SIX REVENUE. WE HAVE FLORA SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THE STATE OPERATIONS BUDGET BECAUSE THE COMPONENTS LIKE THE SEVEN SURVEILLANCE DEVALUATION HELP THE TO SEE CAMPAIGN AND EVEN THE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS. WE HAVE SPELL SOME FLEXIBILITY TO IN A STRETCH IT OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS OKAY AND THE FUNDING -- FAR COMMUNITY WATER FLUORIDATION AND EVEN SCHOOL BASED PROGRAM CAN BE ONE TIME -- SO THAT CAN BE PLANNED IT WELL IN ADVANCE. AND IT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SOME ON OBLIGATED FUNDS THAT WE CAN USE -- TO SUPPORT THE DECLINING REVENUE AND PROFIT TO SIX UNDERSTAND YOU'RE LOOKING AT OTHER ALSO OTHER POTENTIAL OTHER PRETENDING THAT'S RIGHT COULD LEVERAGE TO TO MAKE UP FOR AS WELL OKAY. RIGHT EXCELLENT OKAY. I THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PROGRAM GRANT AWARDS AND GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE ON BRAIN HEALTH. OKAY FOR THE RECORD AGAIN MONICA MORALIS -- SO THIS REQUEST IS IS AN INCREASE OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND AND THIS IS TO SUPPORT. TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A LOCAL ASSISTANCE AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND STATE OPERATIONS. THE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION WILL SUPPORT GRANTS THAT FOCUS ON WOMEN IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR SUPPORT TO PUT. MONITOR AND EVALUATE THE GRANT PROGRESS IN ADDITION IT WILL SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION IN OVER. SKEWS ME AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE ON ALZHEIMER'S PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS. MOVING ON TO HOW WE CAN EVALUATE THE REQUESTS -- CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO REALLY HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE WILL SHAPE BUT THE EFFORTS PERTAINING TO THE GRANTS. SO -- FOR US RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL KIND EXPLORING HOW WE WOULD EVALUATE THE PROPOSALS WE HAVE SOME MECHANISMS IN PLACE THAT WE USE IN THE DEPARTMENT CREATING CRITERIA USING A COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE SO ALL OF THOSE WILL BE EXPLORED WITH ADMINISTRATION AS A GET MORE FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS. THAT'S ALSO THE CASE WHEN IT COMES TO THE COMPOSITION OF THE TASK FORCE AS I MENTIONED DID CHANGE ITS NAME IT WENT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE FROM. EXCUSE ME THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE FOR ON BRAIN HEALTH TO THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE ON AL SUMMERS PREVENTION AND PREPAREDNESS. SURPRISE THIS IS A REALLY GOOD MATCH AND DESCRIBES INTENTION THE FOCUS OF THE TASK FORCE. AS WE LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE NEED AT THE COMMUNITY AND STATE LEVEL WE WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF HOW -- THE PRIORITIES IN ACTIVITIES AT THE A TASK FORCE WILL OUTLINE FOR OKAY [inaudible] LU. SENATE PARTICULARLY -- AND JUST GOING TO STATE THE OBVIOUS WHICH IS JUST THAT WITH THE LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE TASK FORCE IT'S REALLY HARD TO ASSESS WHETHER THE COMPOSITION GOALS DELIVERABLES ALIGNED WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES. OKAY YOU SHOULD FINANCE. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED WERE STILL WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ON DETAILS ON TIME LINES FOR CONVENING SINCE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS AND ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO WITH STAKEHOLDERS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE THE PROCESS. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. SO I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- CERTAINLY THE THIS VERY ISSUE SO WE'RE VERY THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S INTERESTED IN US BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS QUITE PUT SOME RESOURCES AND THEY HAVE A TASK FORCE IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT. THE LEGISLATURE PARTICULARLY THE STATE SENATE HAS BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN AS WELL SO JUST THE A BRIEF HISTORY -- SHE LAST YEAR -- ACTUALLY HELD A AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING LOOKING AT OF WHERE WATER TO FINANCIAL DEMANDS THIS TIME OVERTIME WITH AN AGING POPULATION -- YEAH WE DID -- AND SO THAT WAS A IN THAT ACTUALLY CAME OUT OF BECAUSE OF OF PREVIOUS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING -- WHERE -- IT SEEMED TO BE -- DIDN'T SEEM TO BE AS MUCH FOR SO AND THE LA AS HEALTH AND AND I WAS LOOKING AT FROM THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE REALLY LOOKING FOR FINANCIAL AT THE FUTURE OF THE JUST ACTUALLY JUST LAST MONDAY -- THE A COMMITTEE ON HUMAN SERVICES WHICH IS CHAIRED BY A CENTER HER TADO WHO SITS ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE HELD A HEARING ON AT EIGHT AGING AS WELL SERVICES -- FOR AGING WHICH I KNOW THIS IS MORE ABOUT THE ALZHEIMER'S BY ME CLEARLY ENCOMPASSES THAT ISSUE -- SO I KNOW AND MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE CARRYING BILLS INCLUDING MYSELF -- WE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH THE THE SORCERERS DIRECTORS -- AROUND WHAT WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMS A TASK FORCE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CAP PROGRAMS WE NEED FOR FOR ADULTS WITH LIKE WITH THE COGNITIVE. DISABILITIES ACTION ALZHEIMER'S -- BECAUSE THE WAY WE HAVE THINK STRUCTURED. THE DATE TURF REALLY FIT AND WE'RE LOOKING AT LONG TERM CARE EXPENSES AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP PROVIDE LONG TERM CARE SUPPORTS. SO IS -- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY AS THE ADMINISTRATION AND FURTHER DEVELOPS THE TASK FORCE AND SO FORTH I THINK THERE'S A WE GET A LOT OF ACTIVITY GOING LEGISLATURE WILL BE SURE WE WORK TOGETHER -- SO IT REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S INTEREST IN THE AND HIS EXPRESSION OF THAT INTEREST IN THE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS AND UP AND AND VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY -- INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE -- THAT HAVE APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE I'M SURE OF APPROACH TO GOVERNOR AS WELL SO. I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER ALL AND I APPRECIATE I THINK WHEN -- KNOWS WE GET CLOSER. TO TWO MILLION AND ONE THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE NOTICE HOPEFULLY EVEN BEFORE MAY -- BECAUSE INSTEAD OF HAVING EVERYTHING DUMPED ON US -- ESPECIALLY THINGS LIKE THIS WERE OKAY IT'S A TASK FORCE -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE DEBATING IT'S REALLY ABOUT OKAY HOW IS THIS IDEA OF ALL WHAT KIND OF PIECES ARE THERE WHO'S GOING TO BE AT CENTER THAT WE CAN HAVE. WE CAN TRY TO HOPEFULLY. GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT AHEAD OF TIME -- AS WELL AS IS THAT IT IS IS THIS OF OFFICE AND AND AND WE SERVE MORE SOLIDIFY WHAT THIS IS AND HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE THE AIMS. MUTUAL AIMS WE ALL HAVE RIGHT. DUMP SO HOPEFULLY WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL MAY FOR THAT. ITEM SO I KNOW YOU COME OF THE NEW REVISED BUDGET BAY BUT THAT'S NOT JUST THE MONEY SIDE THING SO OKAY. RIGHT NOT YOU. AND I THINK WITH. ALL RIGHT OKAY ISSUE NUMBER SIX CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM IT PROJECT IN ADDITION. WE HAVE A NEW PERSON COMING UP ALL RIGHT THESE BEINGS ARE. UP. AND NOW THEY ARE NEEDING DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CHAU. NAY BIGELOW SUPPORTING THAT DOES THIS ACTIVITY EXCELLENT. WRITER. THIS INITIATIVE IS A REQUEST OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS WITH EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN FY. NINETEEN TWENTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN FY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN FY. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING. THIS WAS SUPPORT A PERMANENT POSITIONS TO IN OUR NEW DATA SYSTEM THE SURVEILLANCE HEALTH INTERVENTION ENVIRONMENTAL LEADS DATABASE. TITLE TO SHIELD. THE NEW SHOW DATA SYSTEM WILL REPLACE THE AGING RASCAL SYSTEM THAT CURRENTLY SUPPORTS MANAGEMENT OF TILE LEAD POISONING PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. OUR TIãU CURRENTLY HAS LOST A LOT OF ITS BUILT IN REPORTING CAPACITY. AND SO PUBLIC HEALTH BOTH LOCALLY -- AT THIS AS AN AT THE STATE LEVEL IS LIMITED IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT WE CAN ADEQUATELY AND TIMELY RESPOND. TO REPORTS QUESTIONS AND ALSO THE CASE MANAGEMENT AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF OUR CHILDREN. AT THE STATE RIGHT NOW IS THE KEEN -- TO WORK WITH ALL RIGHT TIAS STEEP PARTNERS IN THE DEPARTMENT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW WE DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT CAN MEET THE NEEDS AND WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT THAT. MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS REQUEST WILL GET US TO A PLACE WHERE THE DATA WOULD BE MORE USABLE NOT ONLY TO THE STATE BUT ALSO TO OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE CAME ON AND GOT APPROVED THE BUDGET ACT THAT INCLUDED THE INITIAL START OF THIS VETO PROJECT. THIS PROPOSAL TO DAY IS REALLY THE CONTINUATION OF IMPLEMENTATION -- OF OUR SHIELD ON PROGRAM SO. THAT'S FOR RIGHT. THANK YOU EN THE LA. TONY PETTITT KALLIO. I WE WOULD JUST NOTE I'M AS MY COLLEAGUE -- DID IN THE EARLIER A PORTION OF THIS HEARING THAT -- THERE ARE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS THIS YEAR THAT ARE REQUESTING FULL FUNDING FOR A. T. PROJECTS BEFORE THE PAL PROCESS IS COMPLETE. IN THIS CASE WERE NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT DOES HOPE TO AWARD A CONTRACT VERY SOON. A IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING -- M. BECAUSE BUILDING IT OFF OF THEIR EXISTING PLATFORM AND IT'S MORE OF LIKE AN OFF THE SHELF TYPE A SOLUTION -- BUT WE DO HAVE A COUPLE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE FIRST WOULD BE. TO APPROVE SINGLE YEAR FUNDING SO THAT -- THE THE THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE UPDATES THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL PROCESS -- SECOND -- IT MIGHT BE -- AS THE DEPARTMENT KNOWS ABOUT THE SPECIFIC COSTS THAT ARE PROPOSED BY BIDDERS -- IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE TO HAVE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE AND NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. ABOUT THE PRECISE COSTS -- AND FINALLY IF THE DEPARTMENT DOES GET AN UPDATE ABOUT SPECIFIC COSTS FROM THE BIDDERS BEFORE THE BUDGET DELIBERATIONS ARE FINISHED -- IT WOULD BE GREAT. TO GET AN UPDATE TO THE PROPOSALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN USE THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE ITS DECISION [inaudible] FINANCE. IN THIS PARTICULAR I. T. PROPOSAL WE THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE VITAL TO GET ON SOMETHING STARTED NOW -- WE WILL ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT YOU KNOW. WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITHIN THE TIMING OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AS WELL AND YOU KNOW SHOULD STAGE -- FOR AFTER WE HAVE BEEN NUMBERS AND COSTS -- DIFFERS WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING THERE'S PROCESSES AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST THAT UP OR DOWN SPECIFICALLY CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN OF THE BUDGET ACT THAT ALLOWS. FOR US TO COME BACK AND SAY IF THE CHANGES ARE WITH NO FIVE MILLION OR 20%. DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED JUSTIN SENSIBLE. OKAY. A SO WHAT SO WHERE ARE WAS SO AT WHAT STAGE IS THIS PARTICULAR I. T. PROJECT. SO -- AS WE MENTIONED THERE WAS WE SHOULD BE FOR THE POWER PROCESS AND WEARING A POWER PROCESS STAGE ONE IS FULLY APPROVED AGE TO FULLY APPROVED. A THREE HAS BEEN KICKED OFF THE PARTNERS ARE THERE WAS DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND OUR AGENCY SO WE'RE ACTUALLY IN STAGE THREE RIGHT NOW PREPARING ALL OF THE REQUEST -- FOR CONTRACTING SERVICES AND STAGE FOR WILL THEN START AFTER STAGE THREE FINISHED AND WE EXPECT TO BE AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO AWARD IN THE FIRST PART IN JULY. SO WE'RE IN THE POWER PROCESS RIGHT AWAY WE HAVE A VERY SOLID RECOMMENDED SOLUTION BASED ON A LOT OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE HAVE IN HOUSE ALREADY. SO WE FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THIS BUT WE ALSO NO AT THE END OF STATE FOR THERE IS A RE BASELINE OF THE PROJECT BASED ON THE RESPONSES THAT WE GET BACK FROM OUR CONTRACTORS. OKAY SO IN TERMS OF WHEN WE MIGHT ACTUALLY KNOW IT ACTUALLY COSTS WITH NEARLY ALL THE INFORMATION WHEN WHEN WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO -- WE WE FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH THE COST WE HAVE BECAUSE WE VIEW OTHER COSTS BUT WE WILL KNOW ALL OF THE RESPONSES IN THE MAY JUNE TIME FRAME WE THINK -- SO THAT WE COULD START IN JULY AND BUT WITH CONCRETE ANY CONTRACTS WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW. BE COGNIZANT THAT IT COULD BE DELAYED A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE PRIMARY THERE'S ONE PRIMARY DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT FOR AROUND TEN MILLION THAT. WE'D THAT'S THE THE CRUX ALL OF THE OTHER ONES TEND TO BE SOMEWHAT MORE OVERSIGHT AND OTHER THINGS SO WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THAT AT THAT TIME BUT BUT IT IS A MULTI YEAR PROJECT OR EAST ON AGILE TECHNOLOGIES AND AND WE WOULDN'T WANT TO SLOW DOWN IN. THE MIDDLE YEAH WELL AND AND I'VE BEEN JOE SUPPORTIVE OF THE AYE JOE PROSJE SO BUT I ALSO WENT TO YOU KNOW MAKE NOTE THAT -- SO. OUR ROLE TO APPROPRIATE OUT TO THE BUDGET APPROPRIATE CELL WHILE BILL IS SURE TO WERE KEEP THE PRICE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT -- AND THAT THE PROJECT IS IN ALL IS IS GOING IN AND THE PROFIT DIRECTION BECAUSE AS I SAID. EARLIER WITH ANOTHER I. T. PROJECT I THINK MOST ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT GO WELL YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT. THAT'S GOOD -- THE ONES THAT DON'T WE HEAR ABOUT. SO -- I'D. LIKE TO AYE AYE I'D LIKE TO IS SHE THOSE ALREADY HERE AND UP ABOUT THEM SO THAT ON HERE SO I DON'T HAVE TO HEAR TOO MUCH ABOUT THE GUY THAT. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS -- SO IT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN KEEP A SURPRISED -- ON PROGRESS AND AND AND THAT THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. WE ABSOLUTELY CAN DO THAT I MEAN AS WE RELEASE THE CONTRACTS -- AS RACE THOUGH REPORTS FOR OFFERS WE'LL -- WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU ONLY GET THOSE BACK ABSOLUTELY OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. BUT I DO APPRECIATE GETTING A THEY A SYSTEM FOR A CHILDHOOD LEAD. DOES THAT IS GOING TO BE -- MORE -- FUNCTIONAL AND ALSO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION FOR FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY AN AREA OF GREAT. INTEREST AND OF VERY OF GREAT PUBLIC HEALTH IMPORTANCE SO. APPRECIATE INVESTMENT ALL RIGHT ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN MORE CHILD THE CHILD OF THE POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM REPORTING AND RESULT OF TWO SENATE BILLS. YEAH. THIS REALLY COMPLIMENTED THINK THE PREVIOUS REQUEST IN TERMS OF THE DEMAND THAT THE PROGRAM HAS ON REPORTING. ON THIS ISSUE SEVEN IS A GOVERNOR'S REQUESTS TO INCREASE EXPENDITURES STORY OF SEVEN DOT SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STATE OPERATIONS. TO SUPPORT SIX POSITIONS FROM THE TOUGH FUND -- THE NISHA REQUEST IS DUE TO THE NEW REPORTING MANDATE ON SB. NINETEEN TEN NINETY SEVEN AND SB. TEN FORTY ONE A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON ON THOSE -- A NEW MANDATE SO SB TEN FORTY AND TEN NINETY SEVEN REQUIRES REPORTING OF LET SCREENING BLOOD LET TESTING CASE MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGNATIONS WE ALSO ARE REQUIRED. TO READ A POST THE INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE REQUIRED. TO WORK WITH -- ARE AN INVESTIGATION OF STAFF TO REPORT ON WHAT WAS THAT BECAUSE OF THE LEAD EXPOSURE IF IF IT HAS BEEN ABATED AND YOU KNOW MALLORY DID AN ABATEMENT TOOK PLACE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF JUST DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS THAT IS P. -- TEN NINETY SEVEN HAS ON THE PROGRAM IN ADDITION THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR US TO WORK WITH THE H. C. S. ON MATCHING. OF OUR DATE SPECIFIC DATA SETS BOTH LOOKING AT HOW MANY MEDI CAL CHILDREN HAVE BEEN SCREENED FOR LEAD AND THOSE THAT ARE NOT IN A MEDICAL ALSO SCREEN FOR LEAD. SO -- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE FOR AS KLAY AND PAPER -- YOU KNOW WRITTEN DOWN THERE EITHER SENT TO US BY YOUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OR STAFF COLLECT THAT INFORMATION WE THEN HAVE. TO ENTER IT INTO RASCAL AND SO FORTH SO THE REQUEST FOR US IS READY TO MEET THE MANDATE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN. REPORT IN A TIMELY MANNER AND ALSO TO POST INFORMATION AND PROVIDED TO STAKEHOLDERS AT NEEDED FOR POLICY DECISION MAKING. THANK YOU ELIA. I WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE ONE POINT ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WELL IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT THE SPECIFIC MERITS OF THE PARTICULAR PROPOSAL BUT WE WILL POINT OUT THAT. SB TEN FORTY ONE ALSO REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO NOTIFY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ABOUT THE TESTING REQUIREMENTS AND INFORM -- INFORM THEM ABOUT THE RISKS OF LEAD POISONING -- THE DEPARTMENTS NOT PROPOSING ANYTHING NEW IN THIS REGARD WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND HAS KINDLY YOU KNOW PROVIDED OUR OFFICE WITH THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTENSIVE OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT THEY CURRENTLY DO WHICH INCLUDE GOING TO EVENTS PER OF DOING PRESENTATIONS THAT CAN TO HAVE FREE CONTINUING. MEDICAL EDUCATION COURSE -- IN THE LAKE -- AND THE DEPARTMENT ALSO INDICATED TO US THAT THEY WANT TO USE SOME OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THIS REPORTING PROCESS TO BETTER TARGET THEIR OUR EACH TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. SO THAT ALL MAKES GREAT SENSE -- TO US THE ONLY POINT MAKE IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL HERE REALLY IS TO INCREASE TESTING OF YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEN PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH SO -- WE JUST SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE KEEP AN EYE ON THIS NOTIFICATION EFFORT BECAUSE IF THE DOESN'T REALLY INTO THE INTO THE DAY IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW MUCH OUR EACH IS DONE IF THE HOURS OUT REACHES AND EFFECTIVELY LEADING. TO AN OF TESTING AND INTERVENTIONS [inaudible] FINANCE -- AT THIS WHEN WE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROPOSED RESOURCES SOME REQUESTED UNDER THIS ON PROPOSAL -- WOULD HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO ADD. THE A IS I GUESS A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE IS IS THAT -- GIVEN -- THAT THE LA IS CONCERNS ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO PROVIDE -- COLLECTIVE RIGHT DATA IS. TO THOSE OUTCOMES SO HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE WE SEEN INCREASE AND TESTING AND AND ALSO ACTION ON THOSE RESULTS RECOVERY COLLECTING THAT KIND OF DATA. TO BE SURE WE CAN -- THE REPORT BACK AND SINCERELY MAKING áREA CHEATING ARTICLE. YET WE FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT. WITH THE BILLS AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE G. D. BETTER TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE WHERE ARE THE GAPS WERE WE GOING HOW CAN WE IMPROVE THE EDUCATION TO PROVIDERS. HOW CAN WE TARGET A LITTLE BIT BETTER WITH THE DATA SYSTEM IN THE FUTURE AS WELL OUR GOAL IS TO DO SOME CHILDREN ADDED WERE THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE FAIRLY NOR WITH THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE OUR REACH WITH STILL? ARE IN TEN TO THROUGH THIS -- PARTNERSHIP WITH DH CS AND ALSO THE INTERNAL CHANGES THAT WE'RE DOING IN THE PROGRAM WE BELIEVE WILL SET POINT IS TO ACTUALLY BE IN A SITUATION TO DO BETTER TARGETING OF OUR REGION WITH PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITIES AS WELL OKAY BUT THAT DATA WOULD BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. YES SO WE ARE REQUIRED TO POST INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE OKAY THAT DEFINITELY WILL BE AVAILABLE OKAY BUT WE WANNA BE SURE WE HAVE DATA WE CAN SEE WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS RATES I'M FREE SHEET YOU KNOW. WE WE WE DO THINGS AND SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN SOMETIMES THINGS DOWN RIGHT AND SO AND THEN WE HAVE TO BE JUST WHAT WE DO SO WELL IN KNOWS THAT AND THEN WE THINK ALL THESE THINGS RIGHT TIME. I DO VALUATION PROGRAM EVALUATION SO WE WE DON'T WE DO THINGS BECAUSE WE EXPECT FROM TO GET A CERTAIN ITSELF BUT TO THOSE OF DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO MEASURE THINGS YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH YOU KNOW THIS AND THEN WE GO OKAY MAYBE. WITH THIS THAN WORK AS WELL AS WE THOUGHT IT WOULD AND WE GO. MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS -- THE OTHER QUESTION IS IS THAT SO THE FOR THE STAFFING POSITIONS THE FIVE POSITIONS. SO WHAT WE'RE HOPING IS AS YOU MOVE FROM RASCO WHOSE SHIELD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW THE WITH THIS BETTER SYSTEM THAT. ARE YOU. SO SOME OF THIS IS A AND STAND OUT DATA ENTRY EXTRACTION OF INFORMATION WE GOING IS IS THAT OF THE SOME OF THAT WORK BURDEN GOING GET RELEASED THAT REDUCED WITH SHIELD -- IS THIS THIS IS A STAFFING BASED ON THE FACT THAT YOU'RE STILL HAVING TO DEAL WITH RASCAL RIGHT NOW AND WOULD BE. WITH THE NEW IT SYSTEM WOULD WE ASK MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE THE THE NEW SYSTEM WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT AND AND AND MAKE IT EASIER TO DO CERTAIN THINGS. YEAH THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF RECORDS ON A PAPER. THAT WE STILL NEED TO ENTER INTO RASCAL AND WILL ENTER INTO THE FUTURE DATA SYSTEM SHIELD -- WE ALSO HAVE THE TRIPLED THE REPORTING AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES THAT WE NEED TO DO. SO WHAT WE FORESEE IS THAT WE WILL BASICALLY THE STAFF THAT CURRENTLY IS WORKING ON RASCAL WERE TRANSFERRED TO SHIELD BUT WE WILL ALSO UTILIZE THEM TO CONTINUE ON SOME OF THE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ON A NEW DATA SYSTEM -- HELP WITH THE REPORTING OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS GET A LITTLE SAVVIER ON TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT YOU'LL MAPPING THAT WE FORESEE. SO IT FOR US -- BECAUSE OF THE MANDATES OVER THE PAST FOUR FIVE YEARS ON THE PROGRAM WERE TRYING TO ACTUALLY PLAY CATCH UP AND AND THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT NOT SURE IF YOU [inaudible] OKAY -- ACTUAL IN THE THE NEW SHOW FOR A WILL REDIRECT SOME OF THE DATA ENTRY SERVICES THE MANUAL EFFORTS AS ACCOUNT MAKES ALL THOSE TYPE OF THING. BUT IT'S A TRULY CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO WILL BE ABLE TO REDIRECTION OF THOSE RESOURCES TO MANAGING CASES BASED ON THE NEEDS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL AND WE THINK THAT AND I. T. SIDE WERE ALSO EXPANDING THE WHOLE HELP DESK ENVIRONMENT. TO PROVIDE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE OUT TO THE FIELD TO ALL THOSE OF EXPANDED FUNCTIONS TO MAKE THIS A MORE EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. RIGHT WELL BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE MAKE AN I. T. INVESTMENTS -- I'D LIKE THEM THEM USUALLY ASKS LIKE OKAY SO WITH THIS NEW IT SYSTEM. HOW YOU KNOW HOW? ARE YOU GET EFFICIENCIES LIKE WE DON'T NEED AS A PEOPLE ARE THINGS THAT THAT AND ENHANCE OUR CAPACITY BUT SO THEY'RE NOT DOING THINGS TO FEED THE CURRENT SYSTEM ETCETERA SO -- BUT NO I THINK ALSO IN WHEN YOU HAVE BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEMS. NEEDS RESULT IN SOME EFFICIENCY SELL EITHER GROWTH IN CAPACITY OR DECREASE AND AND STAFFING NEEDS SO IT IT WILL ONCE IT'S IMPLEMENTED SO -- YEAH WE WANTED TRACK THAT. AS WE MAKE OUR VARIOUS INVESTMENTS I APPRECIATE THAT -- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW RIGHT EXACTLY DELUDE BACKLOG YOU NEED THE PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH IT RIGHT AND WHAT'S THE BACKLOGS GOTTEN. THEN AND NOW THEN WE I THINK ARE A WELL WHAT WHAT HAPPENS THEN RATE AND AND SO -- SO WE JUST WANTED THAT AND AND CERTAINLY THERE THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO IN THE AREA SO THESE PEOPLE MAY NEED TO BE RETRAINED RE DIRECTED AT CENTER -- ARE OR OR YOU SAY WELL ACTUALLY WE CAN WE GOT EVERYTHING COVERED SO WE CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE OUR STAFF AND MAYBE THIS BILL AND WORK DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE AND IN THE STATE. SO -- BUT SO IS WHY KEEP THEM MIND ANYTIME WE TALK ABOUT I. T. THE RESULTING EFFICIENCIES THAT WE EXPECT FROM THE NEW IT SYSTEMS [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. AND I THINK -- THAT WRAPS IT UP FOR YOUR TEAM I THINK THE MOVING ON TO WAKE. OKAY THANK YOU -- WAKE LOCAL ASSISTANT ESTIMATE WELCOME. PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELVES THE RECORD. HELLO MY NAME IS DOCTOR CONTINENTAL AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR FAMILY HEALTH. GOOD MORNING CHRISTINE NELSON I'M SHE FOR THE WITH DIVISION DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT SO ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT OUR LOCAL SYSTEM VESTMENT GREAT. SO -- WITHIN THE WEEK AGENDA THERE ARE THREE QUESTIONS SO FIRST ALL STAR WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE CHANGES IN THE WAKE PROGRAM ESTIMATE. CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION DO CONTINUE TO SEE A DECLINE IN PARTICIPATION IN THE WAKE PROGRAM. BUT WHAT WE SAW IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS THE DECLINE WAS LESS THAN WHAT IT HAD BEEN. IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE CURRENTLY SERVE JUST UNDER ONE MILLION PARTICIPATION PARTICIPANTS EACH MONTH AND EXPECT TO SPEND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ON FOOD. IN THE BUDGET YEAR. ABOUT HALF THE BABY'S BORN IN CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR ARE ENROLLED IN THE WICK PROGRAM. AND THE ONLY PROGRAMMATIC CHANGE IN THE PAST YEAR IN IN THE ESTIMATE IS IN FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN U. S. T. A. DID -- APPROVED A AN INCREASE TO THE DOLLAR OF THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT DOLLARS A MONTH TO NINE DOLLARS A MONTH SO THAT WASN'T. A COST INCREASE IN THE PROGRAM THERE AND WE HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO COVER THAT. EACH YEAR USDA DOES PRODUCE A REPORT WHICH WE CALL THE PROGRAM REACH REPORT THEY ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM AND COMPARE THAT TO THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE ACTUALLY SERVED. AND PRODUCE A PERCENTAGE WHAT WE CALL OUR OUR PROGRAM REACHER COVERAGE RAE. AND THE LAST REPORT CAME OUT THIS MONTH OR EARLY THIS MONTH AND IT'S LOOKING AT TWENTY SIXTEEN DATA. WITHOUT REPORT CALIFORNIA SERVICE SIXTY FIVE POINT 6% OF THE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE - EXCUSE ME ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS 54% FOR THAT YEAR. AT THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR COVERAGE RATE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WHERE WE ARE AT SIXTY FIVE POINT ZERO SO WE'LL WE'LL TAKE A SLIGHT INCREASE. OF ONE OF THE INTERESTING CHANGES IN THAT YEAR AND TWENTY SIXTEEN IT WAS THE FIRST YEAR FIRST TIME IN SEVERAL YEARS THAT THERE WAS A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS. SO THERE WAS A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE BUT THERE WAS A LARGER DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE SAID WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT AND A NUMBER OF YEARS. SO WE ARE DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS TO MAXIMIZE PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM AND I'VE SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE IN THE PAST OLD AS JUST TO HAVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF SOME THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING. IN OUR FIRST AREA OF DATA AND RESEARCH WE'RE EXCITED THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE A GOOD PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CAL FRESH PROGRAM WHERE WE MATCH. WITH DATA WITH CAL FRESH DATA WE SELECT ONE MONTH EACH YEAR SO WE LOOK AT MARCH DATA ENROLLMENT DATA FOR BOTH PROGRAMS. THE FIRST YEAR WE DID IT WAS LOOKING AT TWENTY SIXTEEN DATA. AND WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY VISUALS THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR WORK BUT NOT IN WORK AND THEN VICE VERSA. AND THEN WE DID IT ALSO FOR MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WE'RE JUST FINISHING UP FOR MARCH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND HAVE SEEN SOME. SOME INTERESTING THINGS WERE FAMILIES GOING FROM ONE PROGRAM TO ANOTHER OR THEY WERE IN BOTH PROGRAMS ONE YEAR AND ONE PROGRAM THE NEXT YEAR AND THEN BOTH AGAIN AND SO. LOTS OF CHANGES HAPPENING THERE. WERE ALSO REALLY EXCITED ABOUT OUR MOST RECENT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM WHERE WE'RE ABLE TO DO THE SAME TYPE OF A MATCH WITH MEDICAL THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE DONE THAT AND WE'RE JUST FINISHING UP THAT ANALYSIS. SO WITH BOTH OF THOSE TWO TWO TYPES OF ANALYSIS WE DO PROVIDE MAPS TO OUR LOCAL AGENCIES THAT IDENTIFY HOT SPOTS WHERE THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF WEEK OF POTENTIAL ELIGIBLE -- FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SO WE CAN TARGET OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES -- ANOTHER BIG AREA THAT WE WORK ON IS -- IMPROVING OUR PROGRAM SERVICES SO BOTH LOOKING AT REDUCING BARRIERS. TWO AND ROLLING OR PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM AND ALSO INCREASING. THE BENEFITS OR THE RELEVANCY OF THE PROGRAM THERE SO WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF POLICIES. TO MAKE -- ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM EASIER WERE ALSO WORKING WITH USDA TO APPROVE -- A COUPLE PILOTS ONE FOUR TELESERVICES FOR BREAST FEEDING SUPPORT. AND OTHER FOR RECERTIFY. PARTICIPANTS ONLINE RATHER THAN IN PERSON -- AND THEN OF COURSE THE BIG CHANGE THAT WE'RE MAKING FOR THE BENEFITS IS IMPLEMENTING THE WHAT CARD SO WE'LL BE MOVING FROM PAPER VOUCHERS TO THE ELECTRONIC CARD. WE GO LIVE WITH OUR PILOT IN NAPA AND SOLANO COUNTY IS ON MAY SIXTH ON JUST ABOUT TWO MONTHS FROM NOW. WE'RE REPLACING OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT WE'VE HAD IN PLACE FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS WITH THE TRANSFER SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN USED IN OTHER STATES THE MOST RECENT WAS THE YORK AND SO WE'VE. MOVED THAT CODE OVER MAKINGS AND NUMBER OF REVISIONS FOR CALIFORNIA. AND THEN SETTING GETTING GROCERY STORES AND ALL OF OUR LOCAL AGENCIES READY TO GO. THANK YOU. FOR YOUR COMMENTS FINANCE. SO -- IF. IT IF AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE AND I THINK OF BAD THAT SO BILL WERE ABOVE AVERAGE AND ARE WITH PARTICIPATION SO THAT'S GREAT -- I THINK I CAO FRESH THOUGH I THINK THAT SORT OF THE OFFICE I THINK WE'RE KIND OF LOW COMPARED TO OTHER STATES -- TERMS -- CAL FRESH OF DISSIPATION AND THEY HAVE I DO BELIEVE THEY HAVE A LOWER COVERAGE RATE THAN OTHER STRAIGHT YEAH SO -- SO I DO APPRECIATE YOUR PUTTING TRANSIT THE TWO TOGETHER AND IT SAYS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING -- FOR IS IS YEAR. BUT AS YOU'RE DOING THIS I GUESS HE SAID THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING FINDINGS -- pASSUME YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE STUFF LIKE THE SIMS IDEAS OR THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO DO. TO IMPROVE OUR WAY CREATES EVEN MORE I MEAN WE'RE AT WAS IS UP WITH WAS FOR THE SIXTY SIXTY FIVE FIFTY FIVE PROCESO SO I MEAN. THAT'S IT SAYS THAT IT IS HARD TO GET CLOSE TO A HUNDRED GREAT -- BUT THAT DALE DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF IN THE PROGRAM CHANGES THE SEE HAPPENING AS A RESULT OF THIS EXAMINATION OF THIS COMPARISON OF DATA. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO SEE IS IS ARE THE TYPES OF IS IT CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE OR ARE THERE DIFFERENT THINGS HAPPENING DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. OF WIKI AND CAL FOR US OPERATE VERY DIFFERENTLY AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AND WITH WORK WE DON'T OPERATE THROUGH ALL COME COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ONLY ABOUT FORTY DIFFERENT COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. AND THEN WE HALLS ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OFNONPROFIT AGENCIES SO THE WICCAN ROMAN HAPPENS IN A DIFFERENT PLACE TO THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THINGS HAPPENING THERE. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO SEE ADD DEMOGRAPHICALLY HAPPENING DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT PLACES AS WELL SO WE CAN DEFINITELY LOOK AT HOW DO WE BETTER PARTNER WITH -- AT THE WITH CAL FRESH OF THE ENROLLMENT SITE ARE WE LOSING PEOPLE AT A CERTAIN TIME DURING AND WE KNOW WITH CHILDREN THAT AROUND TEN MONTHS OR SO CHILDREN TEND TO START TO BEGIN TO DROP OFF THE WORK PROGRAM. AND HEY MIGHT UPTAKE IN THE COW FIRST PROGRAM AT THAT TIME SO IS THERE SOME KIND OF MESSAGING WE COULD SAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE ONE PROGRAM TO JOIN THE OTHER. THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. I JUST WANTED TO HAS TO THAT IS THAT. I THINK THAT THE INTERESTING QUESTION IS IF YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR ALL THREE PROGRAMS WHY DON'T YOU PARTICIPATE IN ALL THREE PROGRAMS MET SO I THINK THAT ALL THREE AGENCIES ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT SO. WHERE DO YOU HAVE HIGHER PENETRATION OF MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT BUT NOT A BLANK AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IS IT REVERSE WHY WOULD THERE BE SOME PLACES WHERE THERE'S HIGHER WICKETLESS MEDIC HOUSE SO WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER? TO TRY TO CREATE A YOU DON'T BUY DIRECTIONAL INFUSION OF INFORMATION AND SUPPORT IN TRYING TO GET ALL ELIGIBLE PEOPLE IN THE ENROLLED WHEREVER THEY CAN BE. BUT SINCE SAID THE SUBCOMMITTEE ACTUALLY OVERSEAS ALL -- THREE VERY VERY INTERESTED AS RESULTS AND ALSO HEARING FROM THE YEAR PARTNER AGENCIES AND THIS ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY THINK. I A YES AT THAT. WOULD YOU GATHERING GUESSES THE OKAY WELL GIVEN THIS DATA WHAT THE HOW MUCH FOR HOT IS SO SO YOU'RE IT DOES HAPPEN HOW THE HEAVY MORE PERCENT DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT BE A BUMP THIS UP THAT -- BASED ON THE DATA THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU MISSING THAT PAVE WHETHER ALL THOSE PROGRAMS I REALIZED -- MAKE THE VARIOUS BARRIERS AS TO WHY THEY MIGHT STILL NOT WANT. TO ENROLL WORK OF THE QUALIFIED FOR THAT BUT AS YOU KNOW THE FACT WE QUESTIONS IF YOU QUALIFY FOR ALL THREE ONE ACTION ROLLED ALL THREE BUT I MEAN. WHAT WHAT LOOKS LIKE THE POSSIBILITY AT LEAST OF WHO THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO BE CAO FRESH? I MEAN DO YOU HAVE IT'S THE SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THAT. I THINK ONCE WE COMPLETE THE MEDIC HOW MUCH WE MADE A QUICK TO ANSWER THAT BE OKAY. THERE MAY BE INDIVIDUALS THAT. ARE IN NEITHER CAO FRESHER WORK AND THAT WOULD AND SO JUST LOOKING AT CAO FRESH A WILL BE MISSING A NUMBER OF PEOPLE BUT WE'RE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS THAT. THERE WILL BE MORE EL AND MORE INDIVIDUALS IN MEDI CAL THAT ARE NOT IN EITHER OF THE NUTRITION PROGRAM SO WHEN YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND THAT OUT BY -- WE ARE OUR REPORT IS IN THE REVIEW PROCESS THAT OUR DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW SO WE'RE WE'RE GETTING CLOSE OKAY SO MAYBE BY TIME WE TALK TO YOU AGAIN. WE HAVE A STRATEGY FOR INCREASING PARTICIPATION I THINK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS THIS NEW DATA LINCOLN RIGHT REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT'S VERY NEW. TO THE AGENCIES ARE STILL THINKING ABOUT AND I AGREE WITH YOU AND BE GOOD TO SAY. CAN NOW HOW CAN WE DO THIS BETTER HOW CAN WE SHARE DATA ALCHEMY CAM. IDENTIFY THESE HOT SPOTS AND THEN WHAT WOULD BE THE STRATEGIES THAT WE WOULD USE TO RAISE PARTICIPATION OF HOT SPOTS THAT WE'RE NOT READY YET TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE JUST BARELY HAVE THAT ARE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. OKAY ABOUT THAT'S OUR GOAL AND THE OTHER UNKNOWN HERE'S HOW WELL OUR WHOLE NEW YOU WEAK SYSTEM. IMPACT THIS VARIABLE BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW IT DOES MODERNIZE OUR ENTIRE DELIVERY OF SERVICES IT MAKES IT MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND LESS STIGMATIZING TO PARTICIPANTS MUCH MORE ENGAGING MUCH MORE MODERNIZED SO. WE'RE HOPING THAT TO ME REALLY ACT IS THAT SO I GUESS THAT'S OF WHEN YOU EXPECT TO HAVE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION AND WHEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE. TO TO TO TO LEARN ABOUT IT SO SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A REPORT COMING UP PRETTY SOON. I'D LIKE A FEW MONTHS. AND THE YEAR. SO TELL ME AGAIN THAT IT YOU WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC LIKE GOALS FOR NO I ACTUALLY I CHAU JUST CARRY IT I MEAN YOU SAID FELT LIKE THIS REPORT PENDING LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE E. EVERY TALKING ABOUT TO ARE THE OPPORTUNITY I REALIZE NOT EVERYONE. MADE US OR GET A ROLE LIKE WHAT'S THE I'M JUST GET A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY AND OF COURSE THE FOLLOW UP IS IS THAT WHAT YOU GONNA DO AND WHERE DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT ACTUALLY LAND. I DON'T THINK WE SET A TARGET GOAL YET TILL WE TALK WITH OUR CERTAINLY THIS ALLIANCE WITH OUR OTHER AGENCIES OUR SISTER AGENCIES IN COORDINATION IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR INCREASING WITH PARTICIPATION. WE JUST HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SET A GOAL SO IT'S HARD FOR US TO REALIZE I'M JUST SAYING WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT BY AND I'D SAY THAT YOU THAT YOU GOT IT ALREADY SO I'M JUST LIKE. BY. THREE NEXT YEAR AND THE YEAR. EXCEL A JET IS FOR SUMMER OR FALL IN ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF BUT WITH THE REGULAR MEETINGS LIKE WE'RE ALL HOPING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF STRATEGY OVER THE NEXT YEAR OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I'M I'M HOPING YOU COULD HELP YOU WITH. THE ABLE TO SHARE SOMETHING WITH US BY YOU KNOW. BEGINNING NEXT YEAR [inaudible] EXCITED OKAY. RIGHT I MEAN BE GREAT IF YOU CAN SHARE SOMETHING ELSE BY MAY BUT I REALIZE THAT THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN YET. TWO OTHER AGENCIES RIDLEY BEHIND OF IDAHO BUT DON'T WORRY I'LL ASK THEM. TO WE ALL HAVE TO COME HERE YOU JUST HAVE THE FIRST [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] THAT. HEY IT'S GOOD NEWS RIGHT. AND HE SAID THAT THAT THE STUFF YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT THE SAY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY -- THANK YOU WITH ALL RIGHT WELL LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE CALIFORNIA HOME VISITATION PROGRAM EXPANSION. FOR NOW WE'RE TO OUR NEXT TO THIS [inaudible] ADOLESCENT HEALTH. TO INTERVIEW PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELVES. ABSOLUTELY LESLIE CALLAS GATE CHIEF OF THE AND C. H. TO VISION. FROM AND LESLIE GAFFNEY ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR FAMILY HEALTH RIGHT WONDERFUL. THREE SO I WILL GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF OUR HOME VISITING PROGRAM AND THEN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS -- AS WE KNOW DECADES OF RESEARCH ON EARLY CHILDHOOD HOME VISITING SHOW THAT HOME VISITS BY A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL DURING PREGNANCY. AND IN THOSE FIRST YEARS OF LIFE IMPROVES THE LIVES OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. HOME VISITING HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO LOWER RATES OF CHILD INJURY. CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND SMOKING DURING PREGNANCY WHILE IMPROVING RATES OF IMMUNIZATION BREAST FEEDING AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. WE KNOW THAT HOME VISITING IS WELL PLACED TO ASSIST PARENTS AND LEARNING HOW TO PROVIDE THEIR CHILDREN WITH THE STRONG. AND SAFE AND STABLE AND NURTURING CURRENTLY THERE ARE FEDERAL FUNDING ARE CALIFORNIA HOME VISITING PROGRAM SERVES PREGNANT AND NEWLY PARENTING FAMILIES IN TWENTY THREE COUNTIES USING THE N. F. P. AND AS IT HFA EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING MODELS. THE PROGRAM MEETS THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES WHO HAVE ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS AS RICK RISK FACTORS INCLUDE IN IN ADEQUATE INCOME. UNSTABLE HOUSING EDUCATION LESS THAN TWELVE YEARS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND DEPRESSION AND OR MENTAL ILLNESS. IN STATE FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OUR HOME VISITORS MADE THIRTY ONE THOUSAND HOME VISITS. AND THEY SAW APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THAT ARE -- THREE THOUSAND MOMS. SO WE KNOW THAT EIGHT THAT HOME VISITING HAS AN IMPACT IN OUR STATE AND I KNOW THAT YOU ENJOY HOME VISITING IN SACRAMENTO AS WELL. SO I REQUEST WE ARE REQUESTING THIRTEEN POSITIONS AND TWENTY THREE MILLION NJ IN IN GENERAL FUNDS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER TO EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA HOME VISITING PROGRAM. PUBLIC HEALTH WILL DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS ON A SYSTEMATIC AND COMPREHENSIVE. DECISION MAKING APPROACH TO EVALUATE AND SELECT A NEW MODEL AND WHERE BEST TO EXPAND OUR HOME VISITING PROGRAM. IN ORDER TO FOCUS ON LOW INCOME AND YOUNG MOTHERS. EXPANDING HOME VISITING EFFORT INTO OTHER COUNTIES AND EXPLORING THE ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE BASED MODELS WILL ENSURE THE HEALTH AND RESILIENCY NEEDS OF MORE OF A LOCAL FAMILIES IN OUR STATE. SO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW -- WE HAD WE PLAN TO EVALUATE ADDING ADDITIONAL MODELS TO OUR HOME VISITING PROGRAM. AND AT THIS TIME WE DON'T KNOW WHICH NEW MODELS WILL BE SELECTED BUT THROUGH OUR SYSTEMATIC APPROACH AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE L. WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT TRULY UNDERSTAND THE LAY OF THE LAND AND UNDERSTAND WHAT MODELS ARE CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED AND WHAT THAT WHERE THE NEEDS ARE AND WHAT THEY DIGITAL MODELS NEED TO BE ADDED TO REALLY MEET THE NEEDS OF THE OF THEIR POPULATION. SO WE ARE IN CURRENT CURRENT COM WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. AND YOU ALSO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT ADDITIONAL COUNTIES WOULD RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE EXPANSION. AND AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE MONEY FOR ALL COUNTY SO WE REALLY WANT TO GO THROUGH OUR SYSTEMATIC NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS TO REALLY IDENTIFY WHERE THE GAPS IN SERVICES WHERE THE GAPS IN HOME VISITING. AND THEN HOW TO REALLY MEET THE GAPS WITH THIS AT NEW ADDITIONAL FUNDING [inaudible] OKAY ALEJO AS FOR ANY MEDICAL ALE AND WE JUST SINCE YOU DO HERE -- THE DEPARTMENTS AND DIFFERENT -- IN DIFFERENT HEARING SO WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO ALSO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT ABOUT HOME VISITING OVERALL IN THE STATE. SO CURRENTLY THERE'S HOME VISITING THAT'S THE HOME VISITING PROGRAM IN C. PH -- JUST THIS YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES STARTED ITS HOME VISITING PROGRAM IN THE CAL WORKS. OF WITH THE CAL WORKS FAMILIES -- FIRST FIVE ALSO HAS HOME VISITING PROGRAM AS WELL AS EARLY HEAD START AND THEN SOME OTHER LOCAL PROGRAM SO. WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND THEN WHAT'S BEING SPENT IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM -- WE ESTIMATE THIS WOULD NEARLY DOUBLE. THE AMOUNT BEING SPENT RELATIVE. TO EIGHTEEN A DREADFULLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING ON HOME VISITING. OKAY THANK YOU FINANCE RIGHT -- OKAY SO -- APPRECIATE INVESTMENT HOME VISITING IS SOMEONE WHO IS A FOR A FORMER FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONERS A PEDIATRICIAN STUDIED HOME VISITING -- AND THIS AND LOOK AT THE RESEARCH ABOUT IMPACTS CERTAINLY YELLOW WE TALK ABOUT THE TWO MODELS SO WE START WITH -- NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP IN. HAS AMERICA I MEAN CERTAINLY FOR EXAMPLE THERE SPENDING PARTNERSHIP ABLE TO MODEL EXTENSIVE EVALUATION ABOUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS I THINK THE CONCERN IS -- OTHER INTENSIVE USES VERY HIGHLY TRAINED PERSONNEL ALSO TEND TO BE FAIRLY EXPENSIVE -- AND AND SO I GUESS. THE UNDERSTAND YOU IN YOUR TESTIMONY SAID YOU'RE SER WORKING WITH THE LOCALS ABOUT LOOKING AT OTHER MODELS BUT I GUESS THE OTHER PART THOUGH. AND I REALIZE SOMETIMES THERE MAY BE A BIT OF A POSSE OF DATA IS IS THAT WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE. IS THAT THE MODELS THAT THERE THAT THIS IS ALSO BASED ON EVALUATION DATA SHOWS THAT MODELS EFFECTIVE RIGHT -- SO AND A NEW STAND AND SERVE THE HOME VISITING WORLD PEOPLE. NOW DAVID TRYING TO LOOK FOR LESS EXPENSIVE LESS INTENSIVE MODELS AND WE HEAR SACRAMENTO WE WE WE HAD DINNER SALLY PARTNERSHIP WE ALSO BIRTH AND BEYOND AND SO FORTH AND I I I I THINK THAT -- CERTAINLY OF COURSE WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE OF THE LOCAL HELP YOU BUY BE ASKING THIS BUT I MEAN YOU NEED TO ALSO PEOPLE NEED TO SHOW THE EVIDENCE THAT THEIR MODEL. WORKS RIGHT WHAT THAT IS HOW HOW MUCH IMPACT THAT PARTICULAR MODEL BECAUSE I MY GUESS IS IS THAT I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT MODELS THAT MY GUESS IS THAT. THE NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP IS PROBABLY THE MOST INTENSIVE WITH HOW THIS HIGHLY TRAINED FOR STYLE THING SOME OF THE MODELS ARE EVEN MORE SO THAN THAT THAT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT SO THE AND USUALLY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT HOW CAN I DO IT. FOR YOU KNOW STRETCH MY DOLLARS FATHER REACH MORE FAMILIES IT'S UNDER A LOTS OF VERY IMPORTANT GOOD REASONS -- BUT AT SAME TIME FORCE -- YELLED THEN THE QUESTION IS IS THAT WHAT KIND OF IMPACT EVERY GO STILL ACHIEVE THE SAME KIND OF OUTCOMES THAT WE HAD WITH THE OTHER MODELS SO -- THEN KNOWING THAT FIRST FIVE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED A LOT I MEAN THOUGH THAT MAY THE FIRST FIVE TO DONE EVALUATION TO LOOK AT SOME OF THAT EVALUATION DATA AND SAY OKAY NOW ONLY. YOU KNOW I KNOW THIS IS THE MODEL YOU USING BUT WHAT KIND OF VALUATION DO YOU HAVE THAT SHOWS THAT THIS IS. GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE ONE MAKE THAT INVESTMENT IS WE'RE LOOKING AT WHICH MODELS WHAT ACTUALLY. I GUESS TECHNICALLY ADOPTER CHURCHES ARE EXCEPT FOR FOR THIS KIND OF FUNDING SIDE OF YOU ADD ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THAT. WELL WITH IT HFA MODEL WE DO COLLECT DATA SO WE'RE VERY AWARE OF OF THE NEED TO COLLECT DATA AND ACTUALLY SO RESULTS AND SO THAT WILL BE A CRITERIA WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR AT OUR COUNTIES LIKE WHAT MODELS ARE YOU CURRENTLY. ALSO UTILIZING IN YOUR COUNTY AND HOW ARE YOU COLLECTING DATA SO WE DO HAVE THAT COMMITMENT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THIS INVESTMENT IS REALLY GOING TO CHANGE LIVES. AND NOT JUST. TO START UP A MODEL AND NOT AND THEN WALK AWAY FROM THAT WE HOW WE ARE IMPLEMENTING OUR OTHER. MODELS OKAY AND I UNDERSTAND THE HHS HAS A CIVIL LIST THE DIFFERENT MODELS THAT THEY'VE HAD. IN THE TRAITOR EFFECTIVENESS SELF. ALL RIGHT I COULD ADD TO THIS PLEASE WE WE WILL BEGIN BY LOOKING OUT THE TWENTY MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS BEING EVIDENCE BASED MODELS. BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBERS THAT NOT EVERY EVIDENCE BASED MODEL COMES WITH NOT ONLY THE IMPLEMENTATION BUT THE TRAINING AND A DATA PLATFORM RIGHT SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO ALSO ESTIMATE AS YOU KNOW WHAT COMES ALREADY PREPARED WHAT WOULD WE HAVE TO DEVELOP. AND I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT -- WHILE HOME VISITING -- IN GENERAL. I BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFIT FOR VULNERABLE FAMILIES. THERE IS A HUGE BURDEN ON LOCAL COUNTY'S AND TRYING TO COORDINATE THESE EFFORTS AND THAT TOO WE'RE INVOLVED WITH OUR LOCAL M. C. H. DIRECTORS ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU CHOOSE WHAT TO PUT WOMEN IN WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS HOW DO YOU TRIAGE AND HOW DO YOU MAKE THOSE TO SORT DECISIONS AND THEN IDEALLY WE WOULD. LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO SO THEN WHAT WHAT DID YOU HOPE TO ACHIEVE IN DID YOU ACHIEVE WHAT YOU WANTED BUT THAT REFER ALL. SO IT'S IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT COMES WITH A BURDEN. ON NOT ONLY FOR FOR US TO HELP TO GUIDE THIS DISCUSSION BUT A HUGE BURDEN FOR OUR LOCALS TO TO MANAGE RIGHT NOW. WELL I THINK THERE'S STILL LIKE A PRE SHEET THE VESTMENTS IN HOME VISITATION -- BOTH BY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION THAT WE PUT IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND ALSO SO AND ALSO. I THINK ABOUT HOW THE DIFFERENT PIECES COORDINATE EIGHT GOV AND IT'S GREAT WE HAVE LOCAL FOLKS TO STEPPED UP THE NINE YOU'LL SUPPORTED. FUNDING FOR THAT WHEN I WAS ON THE FIRST FIVE COMMISSION WAY BACK ACTIVITY AND AND THEN THE STATE INVESTMENT TO AND BE SURE THAT WE TRY TO COORDINATE BETWEEN THEM CELL. IF IT'S HELPFUL TO YOU WE ALSO CO LEAD THE STATE INTERAGENCY TOYS ON ON HOME VISITING I PLEDGE TO HERE'S AN INTERAGENCY TEAM OUT OF THIS. SO IT WAS ORIGINALLY -- WE STARTED THAT AS WHEN HOME VISITING FEDERAL DOLLARS CAME HERE BUT SINCE CAL WORKS IS NOW INVOLVED WE'VE EXPANDED THEM IN PERSON I ALSO PARTICIPATE SO WE'RE MAKING AN EFFORT AT THE STATE LEVEL TO COORDINATE AND MARK FUHRMAN ANOTHER. ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT [inaudible] OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ARE A TO ISSUE NUMBER TEN BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM EXPANSION. SO AGAIN ALI WILL GIVE AN OVERVIEW AND THEN ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS -- ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA'S HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN ITS OVERALL IN THE MORTALITY RATE AND IS CURRENTLY RANKS THIRD IN THE NATION WITH THE LOWEST INFANT MORTALITY RATE. THE RATE OF MORTALITY AMONG BLACK ADMINS DYING BEFORE THEIR FIRST BIRTHDAY CONTINUES TO BE MORE THAN TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN THE RATE AMONGST WHITE INFANTS. CALIFORNIA ALSO RANKS FIRST IN THE NATION WITH THE LOWEST MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE GET AFRICAN AMERICAN MOTHERS. NEARLY FOUR DIE NEARLY FOUR TIMES AS LONG EXCUSE ME. AFRICAN AMERICAN MOTHERS ARE NEARLY FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM PREGNANCY RELATED CAUSES THAN WHITE MOTHERS. IMPROVEMENTS IN CLOSING THE GAP BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE INTENT AND MATURE MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES HAVE BEEN MADE IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE SO ALL FAMILIES REGARDLESS OF RACE REALIZE THEIR DREAMS. OUR REQUEST CITY PH REQUEST SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION IN STATE GENERAL FUND. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER TO EXPAND THE B. I. H. PROGRAM TO IMPROVE BLACK MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH. M. C. H. C. PH M. CH REQUEST FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF THE B. I. H. MODEL INCLUDING ADDING STRATEGIES TO INCREASE PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. DATA COLLECTION EXPANSION OF B. I. H.

MODEL REVISION BASED ON OUR EVALUATION RESULTS WE WILL PROVIDE TA TO OUR EXISTING B. I. H. SITES. AS WELL AS RELEASE AN RFA TO ALLOW FOR THE EXPANSION OF B. I. H. TO NEWLY TARGETED VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. IN YOUR THREE WE WILL COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA PERFORMANCE MEASURES HOMEOWNER MODEL. AND MONITOR PROGRESS. YOU WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW. THE EXISTING ALLOCATIONS. OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET FOR THE P. THE CALIFORNIA P. P. AYE INITIATIVE WILL COORDINATE WITH THIS WITH THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT AT ITS CORE B. I. H. IS IS ADDRESSING TOXIC STRESS AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. AND P. E. I. A IS GOING TO FUND THOSE WRAPAROUND SERVICES TO SUPPORT THOSE WOMEN. WHAT YOU MAY NOT NOTICE EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN GET GIVE BIRTH? THE H. IS ABLE TO TOUCH NEARLY TWENTY SIX HUNDRED OF THOSE PREGNANT WOMEN. WE ARE ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS NEW APPROPRIATION OF RESOURCES TO COLLABORATE WITH COUNTIES AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE ROBUST STRATEGIES TO REALLY REDUCE THE BLACK WHITE DISPARITY GAP. WE KNOW THAT NOT ALL WOMEN ARE ABLE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TOUCH OUR INTERESTED IN OUR BLACK INFANT HEALTH MODEL. OR ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE V. I. H. PROGRAM RIGHT NOW AS AS IT'S DESIGNED THEREFORE WE WILL USE THE ADDITIONAL BE ICE DOLLARS TO IMPROVE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. AND RESULTING IN MORE WOMEN BEING ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE B. H. MODEL AND THE ADDITIONAL P. E. I RESOURCES WILL ABLE WILL BE THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR THOSE WOMEN NOT INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THE I. H.. OR DON'T HAVE THE LEVEL OF NEED OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MODEL. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE NOTHING WE DON'T HAVE A SOLID WE DON'T HAVE SECRET SAUCE YET WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING TO TURN THE CURVE. ON THIS PROBLEM IT'S GONNA TAKE EVERYONE WORKING TOGETHER TO REALIZE SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT CURRENTLY WE ARE WORKING LOCALLY WITH OUR LOCAL AND C. H. DIRECTORS AS WELL AS STATE LEADERS TO REALLY. THINK OUT LOUD TOGETHER ABOUT THE INEQUITIES AND HOW TO REALLY CLOSE TO THE GAPS WE KNOW THAT RESULTS ARE IMPORTANT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE INVESTMENT IS GETTING WHAT WE WANT. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE USING RESULTS BASIC WORK GOING TO TEACH THE COUNTIES ABOUT RESULTS BASED ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE WILL BE USING THAT SO THAT WE CAN COME BACK REPORT ON THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE. EXCELLENT THANK YOU LA L.. FINANCE. RIGHT -- NIGHT AT THE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE NEAR HERE IN SACRAMENTO HAD EFFORT THAT -- THAT THAT MADE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION AND IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE ELIMINATE THE SEVERITY BUT MADE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION AND EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- WE CONTINUE TO INVEST. AND AND THIS AND TRY IN AN EFFORT -- TO REAL. ELIMINATE THESE DISPARITIES NOW COURTS TO CHALLENGE ABOUT LEADING THE DISPARITY IS IS THAT FORTUNATELY PART OF THE SPACE YOU MENTION TOXIC STRESS COMES FROM -- YOU KNOW OUR GENERAL BACKGROUND OF SOCIETY RACISM OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT ARE HOW RIGHT NOT GOOD ACTUALLY ELIMINATE DISPARITY ITSELF BUT WE CERTAINLY SHOULD TRY TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF SUPPORT SIN. PROGRAMS -- FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED TO THAT WOULD HELP AT LEAST -- REDUCE THAT MEANTIME I THINK WE'VE GOT TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS WE DO.

THANK YOU MICHELLE GIVENS WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND WANTED TO PROVIDE COMMENTS ON A FEW ITEMS TODAY -- RELATED TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR WHO WANTED TO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO KEEPING THE LOCAL ORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS HOLE -- AS DOCTOR KUMAR STATED THERE'S A LOT OFPROCESS IS GOING ON AROUND EVALUATION AND SCREENINGS AND SO FORTH AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WERE CONTINUE SO WE APPECIATE THAT COMMITMENT THERE. EMIGRATING ISSUE NINE FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOME VISITING PROGRAM AND CHECK IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE WOULD LIKE TO BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION AS THE ADDITIONAL MODELS ARE BEING EXPLORED THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF EVIDENCE BASED MODELS BUT THERE COULD. ALSO BE SOME THAT HAVE NOT BEEN EVIDENCE BASE THAT CALIFORNIA CONTEST OUT AND CREE EVIDENCE AROUND AND SO WE'D LIKE THAT CONVERSATION TO BE MUCH BROADER -- FOR THE BLACK INFANT HOLD PROGRAM AND WE TO SUPPORT -- THE ADMINISTRATION'S THOUGHTFULNESS AND INVESTMENT INTO ADDRESSING -- AFRICAN AMERICAN INFANT MORTALITY HOWEVER WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD FROM OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHO I AM AND MINISTER THE PROGRAMS IS THAT IT'S VERY PRESCRIPTIVE IN DIFFICULT AND WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY SEEING THE RESULTS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO IN ALL OF THE JURISDICTIONS. AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN INNOVATIVE SUCH AS WHAT SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS DONE WE WOULD LIKE THE CONVERSATION TO ME BUT TO BE MUCH BROADER. AND THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY EXPANDING THE PROGRAM -- AWAY TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY SO THAT WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AS A WHOLE. AND LASTLY AROUND ISSUE ELEVEN AM JUST RECOGNIZING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO HAVE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FOR AND THEIR MATERNAL CHILD ADOLESCENT HEALTH PROGRAM AND FROM A STAFFING PERSPECTIVE.

THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SUSAN TO MORRIS ON BEHALF OF THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HIS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PROGRAM. AND I WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH INTO WOMEN AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND I WOULD NOTE THAT RESEARCH IS FOR THE FUTURE AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ADOPT AN APPROACH TODAY THAT REACHES PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THE DISEASE NOW. IN THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME HELLO MY NAME'S KAREN FARLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA WITH ASSOCIATION. AND I WANTED TO UNDERSCORE THE GRAY EFFORT THE STATE AND LOCAL STAFF FOR DOING TO MODERNIZE THE PROGRAM. IN WHICH PARTICIPANTS WILL ALWAYS BE YOUNG AND THEY EXPECT A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY WHEN THEY GO TO DO BUSINESS SO GETTING THE EBT CARDS IN THE NEW AND MY SYSTEM ARE IMPORTANT. BUT THE STATE PROGRAM IN THE LOCALS NEED A LOT OF HELP INTO INTRODUCING OTHER TECHNOLOGY AND EVEN YOU KNW THE COMPLICATIONS THAT COME WITH THAT. BUT PARTICIPANTS EXPECT TEXTING THEY EXPECT VIDEO CONFERENCING. IN AT A STATE LEVEL IF WE CAN REALLY EXT EXPEDITE HORIZONTAL INTEGRATION SO THAT WE CAN MAXIMALLY INCREASE PARTICIPATION AND CAL FOR OCEAN. MEDI CAL AND WORK THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IN ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY AND OF RISK MANAGEMENT QUESTIONS COME INTO THAT BUT THAT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT -- SECONDLY I BROUGHT THIS UP THE LAST TWO YEARS THE LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE FOUR YEAR GRANT CONTRACTS WITH THE STATE. IN THOSE CONTRACTS -- WERE QUITE INFLEXIBLE AND IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SPEND ALL THEIR MONEY SO WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH DECREASED PARTICIPATION. IT'S ONLY GOING TO INCREASE THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT. IN THE STATE STAFF HAS WORKED REALLY DILIGENTLY TO WORK ON THIS CONTRACT IS VERY CHALLENGING BUT THEY REALLY NEED SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS WHEN THEY COME HERE AND ADDRESS ALL THE THINGS THAT COME UP. IN SIX DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARENT ORGANIZATIONS WITH CHANGING FACTORS EACH YEAR. AND THEN THIRDLY WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE FISCAL SYSTEMS WORKING SMOOTHLY -- WHICH HAS JUST BEEN WORKING WITH THAT SYSTEM LAST FEW MONTHS AND THERE'S BEEN SOME SERIOUS DELAYS AND INVOICING. AND THE STATE'S STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD TO MAKE THAT WORK BUT WHEN THE LOCAL AGENCIES ARE HAVING TROUBLE MAKING PAYROLL -- BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS SLOW AND THERE'S MULTIPLE STEPS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME.

IF IT'S FOLLOWED TWO DURATION AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OUTCOMES REALLY SHINE THROUGH IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN PROVE WITH OUR MOMS AND FAMILIES.

OF PEOPLE LIVE IN OUR STATE AND A WE NEED TO BE YEAH WE WE NEED REALLY NEED TO WORK ON STRATEGIES. TO HOW DO WE HELP SUPPORT FAMILIES HOW WE TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS WHO WHO ARE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS DISEASE. SELL UP WILL KILL. POLITICS AND PUBLIC COMMENT WE FINISHED ALL THE INVESTMENTS BUT THE CARD HOLDER THING OPEN AT THE END BUT THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH OKAY THANK YOU. YES I WILL BE TAKING PUBLIC ON AT THE END OF HEARING ALL THE PROPOSAL SO NEXT UP WILL TAKE UP IS ACTUALLY THE THE COLD PROPOSAL FOR MANAGING HYPERTENSION [inaudible] CAN HARD. SO YOU GOT THREE MINUTES TOGETHER SO YOU GUYS FIGURE HOW YOU WANT TO BE AT THE TIME. PRESENTING ABOUT FIRST OF ALL COUNT THAT AGAINST YOUR TIME IF YOU PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR PAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOHN MIME THE CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF GENERAL SURGERY MARIN GENERAL HOSPITAL IN A BOARD MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION BAY AREA DIVISION. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JAMIE MARK AND I'M WITH THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION I'M JUST HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH. BACKGROUND I'M A GENERAL SURGEON OF PRACTICE FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AND I'VE WITNESSED FIRSTHAND THE IMPACT OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE ON MY PATIENTS LEADING TO KIDNEY FAILURE HEART DISEASE. ANEURYSM STROKES AMONGST AND MANY OTHER CONDITIONS THESE RESULT IN CANCELED OPERATIONS PROLONGED HOSPITAL STAYS AND INCREASED HEALTH CARE COSTS. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE NEED TO CHANGE THOSE TO TO STICKS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IS A MAJOR IN MODIFIABLE RISK FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO HEART DISEASE AND STROKE WHICH ARE TWO OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN CALIFORNIA. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IS KNOWN AS THE SILENT KILLER BECAUSE IT OFTEN HAS NO SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY HAVE HYPERTENSION. AND MANY LIVE FOR YEARS COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF THE HIDDEN DANGER FOR THIS REASON SEVEN OUT OF TEN PEOPLE HAVING THEIR FIRST HEART ATTACK AND EIGHT AND TEN PEOPLE HAVING THEIR FIRST STROKE. HAVE HYPERTENSION ONLY ABOUT 53% OF ADULTS WITH HYPERTENSION HAVE THE CONDITION UNDER CONTROL IN CALIFORNIA ALMOST ONE IN THREE ADULTS HAS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE WITH SOME COUNTIES HAVING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PREVALENCE. HYPERTENSION DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS COMMUNITIES F COLOR ESPECIALLY AFRICAN AMERICAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES THE PREVALENCE OF HYPERTENSION AND AFRICAN AMERICANS IS THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD IT DEVELOPS EARLIER IN LIFE. AMONGST AFRICAN AMERICANS ADULTS AGE TWENTY AND OLDER NEARLY HALF OF THEM HAVE HYPERTENSION AND THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THE COSTS FOR THE NATION ARE ESTIMATED AT INCLUDING THE COST OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES MEDICATIONS TO TREAT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND MISS DAYS FROM WORK. GIVEN THE STATISTICS IT IS SURPRISING THAT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FOR EITHER CARDIO VASCULAR OR HYPERTENSION PREVENTION. OR FOR EDUCATION OR TREATMENT. BY ALLOCATING FUNDING NOW IN THE STATE BUDGET TO PREVENT HYPERTENSION IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN IMPROVE AND SAVE LIVES AS WELL AS SAVE THE STATE FUNDS OVER THE LONG TERM. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS SEEKS TO CREATE A FIVE TO SEVEN COUNTY. PILOT PROGRAM WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING THE PREVALENCE OF HYPERTENSION AND INCREASING THE BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL RATE AMONGST ITS PARTICIPANTS. THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE. IN HOME BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING ELECTRONIC MONITORING OF BLOOD PRESSURE READINGS AND USING TRAIN COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO RAISE AWARENESS AND EDUCATE PATIENTS ON THE ON HYPERTENSION. AND TO MAKE HOME VISITS TO ENSURE THAT THERE ACCURATELY MEASURING THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE. FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES AND MAKING LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS. OUR GOAL IS FOR AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF THE PARTICIPANTS TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE CONTROL. BY ALLOCATING FUNDING IN THE STATE BUDGET TO ADDRESS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN IMPROVE AND SAVE LIVES AND IMPROVE THE STATE'S FINANCIAL HEALTH THE LONG TERM. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK TODAY AND FOR CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU COMES FROM LA -- FINANCE. SET ASSOCIATES A QUESTION SO YOU'RE ASKING FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE DO PILOT FIVE SEVEN COUNTIES -- A BILL IS COUNTIES COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES TOO BUT I MEAN HOW HOW THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU EXPECT TO REACH WITH THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND AND I WOULD ALSO JUST TAKE NOTE THAT SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- OUT SO WE COULD ARE YOU THAT OKAY WELL DEAR MEDI CAL PATIENTS SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT GAME PAID THROUGH MEDI CAL SIFT THROUGH SEPARATE FUND AND SO ANYWAY TO YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU DRESS LIKE. SO OKAY WE HAVE TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND YOU SORT OF HAD A LIST OF THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT SPEND THE MONEY ON BUT COULD YOU BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE MORE AS TO HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO EXPECT TO REACH FOR THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IF WE ALLOCATE THE MONEY. FOR THIS AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT ARE WE ARE WE GET A FEEL SAY WE ACCOMPLISHED SO OBVIOUSLY THE GOAL IS TO REDUCE I PRETENDED I HOPEFULLY I THINK EVERYONE CAN AGREE ON THAT AND THAT'S A TO SAYS HE SAID. VERY COMPELLINGLY IT'S L. IT'S A KILLER IT DISABLED PEOPLE AT THE SILENT KILLER. SO WHAT WE GET FOR TEN MILLION BUCKS AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO WE'LL WORK WITH DPH TO IDENTIFY -- TRUMP'S BY DENNIS FIND THE COUNTIES SO LOOKING AT URBAN AND RURAL COUNTIES THAT AVE HIGHER RATES OF HYPERTENSION AND THEN COUNTIES WITH -- HIGHER RATES OF HYPERTENSION AND ANGST -- COMMUNITIES AT HIGHER RISK. SO IN TERMS OF THE POPULATION -- THAT WILL BE REACHED KIND OF LOOKING WORKING WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND AND I AM LOOKING AT COMMUNITY CLINICS AND FQHCS. FOR THOSE MEDI CAL PATIENTS WE HAVE LEARNED THAT MEDI CAL DOES COVER. BUT PRESSURE COPS UT OFTEN TIMES IT'S NOT PRESCRIBED SO HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO EDUCATE -- PRACTITIONERS THAT THEY SHOULD GET -- BUT PRESSURE CUFFS REIMBURSED BY MEDI CAL AND THEN FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT ON MEDI CAL THE FUNDS WILL PROVIDE FREE BUT THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFFS SO ACTUALLY MS AS CARE SO -- THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HEARD THIS PROPOSAL I THINK YOU. BROUGHT THIS UP BEFORE SO HAVE THERE BEEN SOME CONVERSATIONS FOR EXAMPLE WITH CD PHD HAVE SOME DATA AND ABOUT. WHICH CARRIED REALIZE YOU'RE DO YOU HAVE BEEN ALLOCATE THE MONEY ATBANG SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHICH AT LEAST WHICH COUNTIES YOU'D BE LOOKING AT AND ALSO DO YOU HAVE SOME. FAQ EIGHT SEES OUR LOCAL HEALTH PLANS AND SAID YEAH WE INTERESTED IN AND AND AND AND AND PARTICIPATING IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GET THE FUNDS I MEAN HOW FAR AWAY. IS HAS ANY OF THAT EXPLORATION HAPPENED YET IN ERMS OF TRYING TO MAYBE MAKE THE PROPOSAL LOW MORE SPECIFIC AND CONCRETE. SO WE HAVE HAD A INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH CD PH HONESTLY WE HAVE STATISTICS THAT I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU -- TERMS OF EACH COUNTY WHAT THE RATES OF HYPERTENSION ARE IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE COUNTY YOU KNOW WE CAN SOLVE CHEST DATA SO WE CAN OKAY BUT YOU HAVEN'T YET EVEN WITH THAT SO I'M JUST LIKE HAVE YOU. LIKE MAYBE THEY'RE DOWN WHICH COUNTIES YOU THINK WOULD BE THE ONES YOU'D BE AND HAVE YOU APPROACH SOME PEOPLE THOSE COUNTY SAID YEAH WE WOULD BE THE ONES WHO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS KIND OF THING IF WE COULD ACTUALLY GET THE MONEY. RIGHT I KNOW WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE COUNTIES WITH THE PH OKAY ALL RIGHT AND THEN THE COMMITTEE HEALTH WORKERS IN THE END THE A BIG BELIEVER IN COMMITTEE HEALTH WORKERS. BUT SOMETIMES IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF MODELS. OF I MEAN DO YOU SEE THEM OPERATING OUT OF CLINICS OR DOCTORS OFFICES -- OUT THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND IF THEY WERE ACTING OUT THE PART EYE SOUTH HOW DO THEY CONNECT UP WITH INDIVIDUAL CLINICIANS HAVE FEW THOUGHT OUT MORE ABOUT THIS -- COMMITTEE HEALTH WORKER MODEL HOW YOU WOULD MAKE THAT OPERATIONALIZE YES WE ENVISION THAT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER WILL WORK OUT OF THE CLINIC OR PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE. OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY WELL -- I THINK THERE'S A COMPELLING CASE YOU'RE MAKING ABOUT -- WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT I IS WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL AT LEAST IN MY MIND THAT I HAVE OTHER PEOPLE THE COMMITTEE THIS -- AND I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY YET BUT THEY NEED TO TO SEE WHETHER. NOW YOU SIR PICKED FIVE SEVEN COUNTIES TEN MILLION BUT MAYBE TO START THINKING ABOUT. THANK. WHO WHOSE COALITION THE WILLING RIGHT NOW WHO WHO WHO MIGHT BE IF WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE MONEY TO BUY THAT THAT WOULD BE? A LITTLE MORE CONCRETE ABOUT OKAY IF YOU GIVE US THE MONEY WE WOULD THEN BE ABLE THOUGH WELL WE GOT WE GOT THREE COUNTIES ON BOARD AND WE HAVE THESE HEALTH PLANS AND THEY THINK THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO REACH EXT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN OF COURSE DEPARTMENT DOES. PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- TO CERTAIN THAT DEBT AND ON SOME BUT AND SOME BUDGET PROPOSALS BUT I THINK IT'S THAT THAT MIGHT HELP MAKE IT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET. TO GO BACK TO MY FIRST QUESTION WE'RE GONNA GET BACK FOR THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS YES IT'S A PROBLEM WE A LOT PEOPLE TELLING US HEY WE CAN GET SOME MONEY BECAUSE SOFT YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL BUT BAKER MOVEMENT ON THE PROBLEM. MAYBE WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE CONCRETE THAT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WORK OUT EVERYTHING BECAUSE BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT HAPPENED THIS MONEY WOULD BRING OUT GET LOST THE HIT THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM RIGHT AND I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF USING COMMITTEE HEALTH WORKERS EDUCATE PEOPLE AND SO FORTH SO -- THAT AND JUST. CATHOLIC FEELING LIKE SO WE WILL. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND SEE RIGHT NARROWED DOWN COUNTIES HERE QUESTION WE WERE TRYING TO LEAVE -- SOME LEEWAY FOR YEAH YOU HAVE TO TAKE A AND THAT'S A LIKELY YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM IN ADVANCE BUT I AM JUST SO LIKE OKAY WELL THAT THAT. IS IS THAT SAID IF I COULD BE INTERESTED IN HOW WILLING AND READY. TO TO YELL SO I THINK THAT THAT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL RIGHT. NOW THERE ARE SOME. SOME COUNTIES THAT HAVE RECEIVED BY BRING THEM AT THE STATE THROUGH CDC GRANTS BECAUSE WE HAVE ANY OTHER. GENERAL IN GENERAL ARE A DOLLARS -- APPROPRIATE IT TO THE PROGRAM. BUT COUNTIES HAVE WORKED ON DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE PREVENTION INITIATIVES LOOKING AT TRYING TO DRIVE DOWN. REPRESENTS IN RETENTION SO I AM IMAGINE YOU KNOW. ON DISCUSSION WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT SOME OF THOSE COUNTIES WOULD LIKE -- TO FURTHER SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS OR CONTINUE TO WORK IN THAT SPACE -- ESPECIALLY GIVEN SOME OF THE CDC DOLLARS HAVE GONE AWAY. OF MORE WORK TO DO WE WILL DEFINITELY SHARE INFORMATION WITH YOUR YOUR STAFF OKAY AND ENOUGH CELEBRITY UP THE ONE AT THERE'S AND NATIONAL% COLLABORATIVE. TARGET BP WITH THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION KIND OF PROVIDES A NATIONAL FRAMEWORK THINK YOU'RE VERY IMPORTANT POINTS. FROM A TAURUS YOU UTILIZING COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN PARTICULAR I THINK IS ONE PATH FORWARD BUT THANK YOU FOR THIS COMING OUT SIDE I THINK IF WE CAN GET -- MAIL. MAYBE SOME FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF SOME OF THESE IDEAS THAT MIGHT. HELP THE HELP HOPE FOR HELP MOVE THIS ALONG AND OKAY MY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST.

AND THAT IS DESPITE FACING SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO CARE AND SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE -- TWO AND A HALF MILLION LESBIAN BISEXUAL IN QUEER WOMEN -- THIS IS A POPULATION THAT'S BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDER SERVED AND IS A DESIGNATED HEALTH DISPARITIES POPULATION -- BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH -- HAS BEEN BI SEXUAL IN QUEER WOMEN EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES SUCH AS HIGHER RATES OF SMOKING. ALCOHOL USE ANOTHER SUBSTANCE USE -- HIGHER RATES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HIGHER RATES OF CANCER MORTALITY AND THE LIST GOES ON THESE DISPARITIES ARE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED FOR LESBIAN BISEXUAL AND QUEER WOMEN OF COLOR IN TRANS GENDER LESBIAN BISEXUAL IN QUEER WOMEN -- DESPITE THE MAJOR EXPANSIONS OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE STATEWIDE LESBIAN BISEXUAL IN QUEER WOMEN STILL STRUGGLE TO ACCESS CARE -- THIS LESBIAN BISEXUAL IN CORBIN ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A REGULAR DOCTOR AND 30% HAVE PUT OFF NECESSARY HEALTH CARE EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE INSURANCE -- MANY I'LL BE Q. WOMEN DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION WITH THEIR PROVIDER AND HALF OF EXPERIENCED DSCRIMINATION IN A HEALTHCARE SETTING -- AND LESBIAN BISEXUAL IN CRIMINAL MORE LIKELY TO BE LIVING IN POVERTY TO HAVE. TROUBLE ACCESSING TRANSPORTATION AND DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT REVENT THEM FROM GETTING IN TO SEE THE DOCTOR WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY REQUESTING THAT CREATION OF AN L. B. Q. WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY FUND. AND I WOULD JUST ADD -- TO BREAK THAT DOWN A LITTLE -- THE SEVENTEEN AND A HALF MILLION WOULD BE BROKEN DOWN INTO TWO PARTS FIFTEEN AND A HALF MILLION WOULD GO TO THE CREATION OF THE LESBIAN BISEXUAL QUEER WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY FUND UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. AND THAT WOULD FUND FOUR CORE COMPONENTS THE FIRST THE SIX AND A HALF MILLION TO FIND EIGHT DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT WILL PROVIDE HEALTHCARE NAVIGATION ASSISTANCE AND LINKAGE TO CARE. WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASING HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION RATES AND PREVENTATIVE SCREENINGS. THREE MILLION WOULD FUND LOCALIZE COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT ENSURING UNDERSERVED VOICES GUIDE PROGRAMS -- AND THE SERVICES FOR YEARS TO COME THREE MILLION FOR COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND OUTREACH BOTH BROAD TOPIC OF PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS AS WELL AS TARGETED KIND OF IN DIVIDE VISUALIZED EFFORTS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES.

TO WIN LESBIAN BISEXUAL QUEER WOMEN ACCESS CARE THEIR IDENTITY IS FORMED AND THEY ARE RETAINED.

AND TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THIS WILL BE THE FIRST EVER. UP PROGRAM OF DEDICATED FUND BURKE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU COMMENTS MILLIA. FINANCE OKAY. SO -- CHáVEZ SO THE QUESTION OF OTHER PEOPLE SO GIVEN THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING -- FOR AND THAT APPRECIATE YOU BROKE IT DOWN TO WRITE A DIFFERENT. WAYS THEM PARTS GOING TO BE USED -- HOW? HOW HOW MANY? THAI PEOPLE YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE ARE HAVING COMMITTEES YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO REACH RIGHT WE HAVE -- DEMO PROGRAMS NEED TO SET NEEDS ASSESSMENT NOW THEY OF DECIDING ABOUT HOW HOW GIVEN THE NOW BY HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN REACH AREA DO COMMITTEE EDUCATION AND TRAINING HEALTH PROVIDERS -- SO. CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO GIVE IN THIS PART OF MONIES FIGHT NOT SUFFICIENT REACH EVERYBODY BUT HOW HOW HOW FAR DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET AND YEAH. YEAH WITH THE WITH THE STATE AND I THINK SOME OF THIS WOULD BE. ARE YOUR NUMBERS FOR THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS WHICH I THINK WOULD HAVE THE MOST DIRECT IMPACT ON ONE ON ONE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW LINKAGE TO CARE -- MODELING AND AFTER OUR INTEGRATED CARE PROGRAM WE WOULD EXPECT THAT FOR EACH FULL TIME EMPLOYEE WHOSE FUNDED UNDER THIS PROGRAM THEY WOULD HAVE ABOUT SIXTY CLIENTS SO ABOUT A THOUSAND CLIENTS PER YEAR. AND THIS IDEA WAS A DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR A THREE YEAR GRANT PROGRAM AND THE HOPE IS THAT -- DOES ADD THOSE PROJECTS THERE'S BUILT IN EVALUATION -- WITHIN THE THAT THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS SO THAT WE CAN REALLY SEE WHAT'S FOR THE EFFECTIVE MODELS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE REACHING WHAT IS THE IMPACT HOW CAN WE MEASURE IT AND THEN HOPEFULLY BUILD ON THAT AND AND AND USE THE SAYS AS THE START OF OF SOMETHING THAT. CAN REACH FOLKS GOING INTO THE FUTURE. AND YOU SEE ANY OPPORTUNITIES. TO MIGHT BE A LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDS -- FEDERAL OR NOT PROFIT OR OTHER TYPES OF FUNDS. I MEAN I DON'T THINK THERE'S A TON OF MONEY COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW FOR LESBIAN BISEXUAL PER WOMEN BUT WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE WILLING TO LOOK INTO THAT EFFORT. WELL THIS IS AS IF YOU PROVIDE SOME HEALTH CARE. FOR THIS POPULATION BUT THERE ARE MEDI CAL YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT [inaudible] IT'S THE LEE AND I MEAN I HINK THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO SEE SOME OF THAT -- EQUITY MEASURES THAT ARE COMING OUT OF MEDICAL CALLIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHERE WE CAN REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THIS POPULATIONS BEING SERVED BY MEDI CAL AND I THINK. WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE ABLE -- TO TO USED -- AND AND LIBERTIES PROGRAMS -- AS EXAMPLES OF OF HOW MEDICAL CAN REACH IT EQUITY GOALS -- GOING FORWARD OKAY. EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU. RIGHT -- THE NEXT ITEM IS -- THE STICKER PROPOSAL FOR THE SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM AUGMENTATION [inaudible] COME. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN BUT YOU DO NEED TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR PAN AND COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS IT'S VERY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN MY NAME IS JANET NUDELMAN I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM AND POLICY. AT BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS WE ARE THE ONLY NATIONAL ORGANIZATION SOLELY DEVOTED TO PREVENTING BREAST CANCER BY LAMINATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL LINKS TO THE DISEASE. I GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR PANNING COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS I'M LINDA JUDY'S I AM A CALIFORNIA LICENSED PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON. BOARD CERTIFIED IN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY AND INFERTILITY AMOUNTS TO A BIOCHEMIST AND A FACULTY MEMBER AT UCSF. I COME TODAY AS THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE OF REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. FOR THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION ON OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY KNOWN AS SPEAKER. RIGHT BOOK RIGHT AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SPLITTING OUR THREE MINUTES. THREE MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT DIVIDE BETWEEN YOURSELVES OKAY. SO OUR PROPOSAL SEEKS A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTIN IT'S PROGRAM. OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THEREAFTER TO SUPPORT ONE TIME INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES TO THE PROGRAM'S ELECTRONIC REPORTING SYSTEM AND PRODUCTS DATABASE. AN ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT RESEARCH AND OUTREACH STAFF. THIS BUDGET IS IDENTICAL THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS IDENTICAL TO THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL THAT WE SUBMITTED LAST YEAR. WHICH WAS APPROVED BY YOUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THANK YOU. AND ALSO INCLUDED IN THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BUDGET BILLS APPROVED BY BOTH HOUSES BUT SADLY REJECTED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. THE CALIFORNIA SAFE COSMETICS PROGRAM PROVIDES CRITICAL INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS AND WORKERS TO HELP THEM AVOID BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING CHEMICALS LINKED TO CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS. YET IT DOESN'T HAVE THE FUNDING IT NEEDS TO MODERNIZE ITS REPORTING SYSTEM. CONDUCT OUTREACH TO WORKERS AND CONSUMERS TO HELP THEM UTILIZED THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH TO ALL OR ENSURE THAT COSMETIC COMPANIES ARE COMPLYING WITH THE SAFE BECAUSE MEDIC ACTS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE SAFE BECAUSE MEDICS PROGRAM LAUNCHED ITS PUBLIC DATABASE FIVE YEARS AGO THE INFORMATION IT PROVIDES FOR CONSUMERS AND WORKERS ALIKE. IS MORE NECESSARY THAN EVER WE HOPE THAT THE ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL ONCE AGAIN SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT BUT MODEST REQUEST. AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE DOCTOR DUTIES TO ADDRESS THE SCIENCE LEAKING CHEMICALS IN COSMETICS TO HARM TO HUMAN HEALTH. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE -- OUR FIGO COMMITTEE TWENTY FIFTEEN DISSEMINATED A CALL TO ACTION. FOR INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. THAT ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING CHEMICALS EXPRESSION LEE WITH EXPOSURES DURING CRITICAL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. ARE CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF ADVERSE INCLUDING CANCERS DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS METABOLIC AND REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS. AT UCSF OUR PROGRAM FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPED A TOOL KIT CALLED TOXIC MATTERS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. TO ADVISE ON PATIENTS AVOIDING EVERYDAY EXPOSURES TO TOXIC CHEMICALS ESPECIALLY DURING PREGNANCY AND ONE OF THE RESOURCES WE IST IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE COSMETICS PROGRAM. WE BELIEVE THAT PHYSICIANS AND THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW ABOUT WHAT KEPT TOXIC CHEMICALS ARE IN THE FULL RANGE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE MAINLY TO DECREASE THEIR RISKS. ALSO WE KNOW THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE SMALL EXPOSURES CAN ADD UP TO HARM DEPENDING ON TIMING DOSE AND DURATION. AND AT PARTICULARLY DURING DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD SUCH AS PREGNANCY AND IN CHILDREN. FURTHERMORE CUMULATIVE EXPOSURES CAN ALSO HARM ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO USE CHEMICALS EVERY DAY SUCH AS BEAUTY SALON WORKERS WHO WERE EXPOSED TO PROP SIXTY FIVE CHEMICALS IN THE PRODUCTS THEY USE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME EVERYDAY. ALL DAY. THE BASE OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IS ROBUST LINKING HUMAN HARM TO HUMAN HEALTH FROM TOXIC CHEMICALS IN PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AND BEING INFORMED ABOUT THESE HIDDEN DANGERS EMPOWERS CONSUMERS AND POLICY MAKERS ALIKE TO IMPROVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU COME AS FAMILIAL. FINANCE. NOW ALL RIGHT.

IS FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE THAT THE SACRAMENTO LGBT COMMUNITY CENTER STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. HI. MY NAME'S ANTI MASANYA I'M A NURSEPRACTITIONER PROVIDING PRIMARY CARE AT THE LOS ANGELES LGBT CENTER FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH HEALTH CLINIC. THERE I MANAGE THE DEALER HEALTH PROGRAM FOR LESBIAN BISEXUAL IN CLEAR WOMEN. IN THIS PROGRAM WE TAKE A WHOLE PERSON APPROACH STRIVING TO MEET THE MULTIPLE ON MET PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND THIS MARGINALIZED. AND OFTEN OVERLOOKED POPULATION TARA AND AMANDA OUTLINED FOR YOU SINCE SET THIRTY SIX AND DATA ABOUT THE DISPARITIES IN THIS POPULATION. THOSE NUMBERS ARE THE PATIENTS THAT I SEE DALY. OFTENTIMES I AM THE FIRST PROVIDER THAT THEY'VE SEEN IN MANY YEARS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS MY PATIENT WHO WILL BE HAVING A HYSTERECTOMY IN TWO WEEKS FOR CANCER THAT COULD HAVE. SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT WITH THE ROUTINE TIRED OF ANSWERING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS QUESTIONS ABOUT HER HUSBAND OR BOYFRIEND SHE WAS WARY OF EXPLAINING THAT SHE DIDN'T NEED A PREGNANCY TEST OR BIRTH CONTROL. HER SEXUALITY HER IDENTITY WAS DISMISSED SO SHE FELT DISMISSED. I HEAR SIMILAR STORIES LIKE THIS ALMOST DAILY THE LACK OF LESBIAN BISEXUAL AND QUEER WOMEN'S CULTURALLY COMPETENT HEALTH CARE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AND THIS IS WHY CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO FUND THE LESBIAN BISEXUAL INCREMENTS HEALTH EQUITY FUNDS OKAY THANK YOU. WELCOME AYE THERE -- MY NAME IS AMY CAN I MANAGE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAM AT THE LOS ANGELES LGBT CENTER -- I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE L. B. Q. EQUITY FUND I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT A CLIENT OF OURS. WHO CAME TO THE CENTER -- SHE IS A LESBIAN IDENTIFIED CLIENT TO IS IN A VIOLENT RELATIONSHIP WITH HER PARTNER -- DURING ONE OF THEIR FIGHT SHE WAS -- STRUCK IN THE HEAD AND ALSO HER HEAD WAS THROWN INTO THE SIDE OF A CAR. WHEN SHE PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS SAID TO HER YOU COULD NOT HAVE SUSTAINED A BRAIN INJURY BECAUSE A WOMAN CANNOT? HIT YOU THAT HARD ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN AN INJURY. SO SHE WENT AWAY FEELING EMBARRASSED AND ASHAMED AND SHE DID NOT SEEK MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. AFTER THAT FOR MANY YEARS SO HER SYMPTOMS WENT UNTREATED SHE'S NOW DEALING WITH PTSD. AND POSSIBLE NARAL COGNITIVE ISSUES AND THIS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED WITH CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE -- THESE WOMEN ARE VISIBLE WE NEED TO HELP THEM WE NEED TO SUPPORT THEM THANK YOU THANK YOU WELCOME. VISITOR MEMBERS MANY WE ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNSEL -- UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS PROPOSAL WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THIS YEAR UNLIKE LAST YEAR -- WE ARE SEEKING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO FUND THIS BUDGET AUGMENTATION RATHER THAN PLACING A FEE ON MANUFACTURERS. HOWEVER HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH THE DATABASE -- THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THAT WERE JUST FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO THE STATE FUNDING A DATABASE -- THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION THAT'S READILY AVAILABLE ON THE PRODUCT LABEL WE DISCUSS IS CONCERNED WITH THE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED. TO THE DATABASE WHICH REQUIRES REPORTING OF CHEMICALS REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH IS IN THERE AND WHETHER IT'S PRESS POSES A HUMAN HEALTH RISK -- AND LASTLY WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY OTHER STATE DATABASE ON ANY OTHER PRODUCT CATEGORY AND THAT'S JUST WORTH NOTING -- FOR FOR PURPOSES OF THIS COMMITTEE. WE ALSO QUESTION THE VALUE OF THIS DATABASE TO THE CONSUMER BECAUSE BASED ON INFORMATION THAT WE GOT FROM A DPH REPORT IN -- TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE NUMBER OF WEBSITE HITS FOR THIS DATABASE AVERAGED ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED HITS A MONTH. IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE PURCHASED AND USED EVERY SINGLE DAY IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S A FRACTION -- SO WE REALLY QUESTION THE USE OF THE CONSUMER USE OF THIS DATA BASE -- ONE OF THE LAST THINGS I'D LIKE TO NOTICE I'D CAUTION THE COMMITTEE ON APPROVING THIS -- BUDGET PROPOSAL BECAUSE THERE IS A BILL THAT'S PENDING IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT RELATES. TO THIS VERY DATABASE SB. FIVE SEVENTY THREE AND SHOULD THAT BILL PASSED ON A I'M SURE THAT THE SAME GROUPS WILL BE BACK IN YOUR COMMITTEE NEXT YEAR ASKING FOR A MUCH LARGER BUDGET AUGMENTATION BECAUSE THE SCOPE OF THAT BILL DOES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THE SAFER BECAUSE MEDICS PROGRAM. AND THEN THE VERY LAST ITEM IS THAT WE ARE. WE LOOKED AT THE BUDGET SUMMARY IN DETAIL COMPARED TO LAST YEAR'S AND IT'S LARGELY THE SAME HOWEVER WERE CONCERNED. THAT -- WE ARE DISCUSSING IS IN A BUDGET ITEM NAMELY BUDGET ITEM ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN REQUIRES. COMPANIES TO REPORT TO THE STATE DATABASE WHETHER THEIR PRODUCTS ARE INTENDED FOR PROFESSIONAL SALON USE. FOR CONSUMER USE WHICH DID A FRESH READING OF THE ORIGINATING STATUTE IS NOT AUTHORIZED IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. WELCOME ALONE THE COOKING NOTICE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE FRAGRANCE CREATORS ASSOCIATION -- INDUCTION TO THE COMMENTS THAT -- YOU DO WE JUST MDE ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL -- WE DO JUST WANT TO REEMPHASIZE -- SORT OF THE INTERPLAY THAT WILL BE HAPPENING WITH SB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR AND THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL KIND OF MOVING SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT RECOGNIZING THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL HAVE TO BE ACTED ON PRIOR TO THAT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THAT BILL. AND YOU KNOW THOSE POLICY DISCUSSIONS ARE OF COURSE GOING TO BE ON GOING WE'RE STILL EVALUATING THE IMPACTS OF THE LEGISLATION -- AND WE CERTAINLY ARE GOING TO ENGAGE WITH THE OFFICE OFFICE AND AND THE SPONSORS OF THAT LEGISLATION -- BUT I JUST FOR EXAMPLE WANT TO POINT OUT YOU ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS -- TO AT IT AND VESTED GATE IN -- THE CURRENT POLICY LET -- LANGUAGE -- WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED TRADE SECRET WOULD BE DRASTICALLY REDUCED SO I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME INTERPLAY THERE AND THEN JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T HELP MYSELF -- AND THE WORD ABUSE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN PRODUCTS ON HE DATABASE THE EVEN CLAIM ANYTHING IS TRADE SECRET AND THAT'S OUT OF SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND SO. IT IS -- A VERY SMALL NUMBER BUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON ALL. THE QUE THANK YOU. IT WILL COME TOGETHER FIGURE OUT OKAY SO -- AGAIN I'M WITH -- ANY OTHERS DON'T SEE ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE WE WILL HOLD -- EACH THE FOR STAKEHOLDER. AT PROPOSALS -- AND SO -- AND THEN WE WILL CONSIDER THEM ACTUALLY AFTER PROBABLY AFTER MAY -- SO WITH THAT -- I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARING. AND SEE EACH SO YEAH SO ALTHOUGH THOSE ITEMS OPEN I'LL FOR STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS AND SO WITH THAT THAT CONCLUDES THE AGENDA FOR THIS HEARIN OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER THREE OF THE SENATE BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW. COMMITTEE AND WE ARE NOW ADJOURNED THANK YOU
