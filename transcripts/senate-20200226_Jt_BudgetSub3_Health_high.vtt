ON- AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:06.238
PROJECT AT PROCUREMENT. THE TO.

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:08.040
COMMENTS SEVEN ONE IS THE PLAN

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.541
CERTIFYING THEIR DELEGATED

00:15:09.608 --> 00:15:11.076
NETWORKS IS ACTUALLY REALLY

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:14.113
IMPORTANT- IT'S A SIGNIFICANT

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:15.214
LIVE FOR THE PLANS AS A LOT OF

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:17.182
WORK TO THAT. BOARD INSURERS IS

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:19.151
THAT WHEN A MEMBER PICKS. AN

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:21.287
IPA OR PLAN THAT'S A SUB

00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:23.222
CONTRACT TO THE PARENT PLAN.

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:24.290
THAT THERE IN FACT GETTING

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:25.624
ADEQUATE NETWORK BECAUSE ONE OF

00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:27.660
THE ISSUESCOULD BE. YOU THINK

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:28.761
THAT YOU'RE JOINING THIS PLAN

00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:30.729
WITH A CERTAIN NETWORK YOU JOIN

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:32.364
IPA AS PART OF THAT PLAN-

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:34.233
MEDICAL GROUP. AND SUDDENLY YOU

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.334
ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS AS

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:36.302
MUCH AS YOU WOULD THINK SO

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:37.369
THAT'S- THAT'S PRETTY

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.305
SIGNIFICANT AND IS IT IS. YOU

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:40.105
KNOW A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK FOR

00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:41.540
THE PLANS BUT I THINK. IT

00:15:41.607 --> 00:15:43.309
REALLY INSURERS A MEMBER THEN.

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:45.778
KNOWS YOU KNOW BASED ON THE

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:48.314
CERTIFICATION THAT THEY'RE

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:48.914
GETTING THAT THEY'RE GETTING A

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:50.449
RESULT OUR- THE SECOND ITEM IS.

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:52.017
THEM THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:53.552
LEVEL OF A FIFTIETH PERCENTILE

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:54.820
NATIONWIDE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:56.722
SIGNIFICANT I MEAN FIFTIETH

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:57.323
PERCENTILE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:59.291
THAT MUCH. BUT WHAT IT'S SAYING

00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:00.392
IS THAT ACROSS THE ENTIRE

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:01.994
NATION LOOKING AT ALL THE

00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:03.562
MEDICAID PLANS. THAT EVERY

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:04.663
SINGLE MEASURE THAT THE PLANS

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.931
ARE BEING MEASURE AGAINST.

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:07.499
THEY HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN THE

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:10.269
AVERAGE. AND SO I JUST WANNA

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:11.403
LET YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THERE

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:12.671
WILL BE FAILURES I MEAN THERE

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:14.173
WILL BE PEOPLE BELOW BECAUSE-

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:15.841
SO LAW OF AVERAGES FOR ONE

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:17.609
POINT- BUT PLUS IT'S ACTUALLY

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:19.812
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT BAR. I THINK

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:22.047
IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A HIGH BAR-

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:23.449
BECAUSE IT'LL PUSH PLANS TO YOU

00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:25.050
KNOW. AND WHAT WOULD BE NICE IS

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:25.918
IF YOU KNOW YOU WE GET

00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:27.920
CALIFORNIA UP THERE. SUDDENLY

00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:29.021
WERE NOT LOWER THAN THE REST OF

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:30.723

DELEGATED NETWORKS BECAUSE WE

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:18.704

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:47.266
APARTMENT THINKING ABOUT. YOU

00:17:47.332 --> 00:17:48.500
KNOW MONITORING ON AN ONGOING

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:51.537
BASIS THE- THESE DELEGATED

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.305

WHEN THEY FIRST START IS GOOD.

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:59.211
IS THERE SOME OTHER MECHANISMS-

00:17:59.278 --> 00:18:01.847
THAT- EMPLOYED ENSURE THAT THE

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.016
STATE WITHIN THE STANDARDS THAT

00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:04.950
YOU REQUIRE AND FORTUNE WE DID

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:06.985
HAVE. YEAH WE DID HAVE A COUPLE

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:08.420
CIRCUMSTANCES A FEW YEARS AGO

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:10.155
WHERE. SOME OF THE DELEGATED

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:12.758
ENTITIES- WERE NOT WHAT THEY-

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:18.096
SEEM TO. PRADA SO YEAH I STILL

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:20.632

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:21.967
A ONE TIME CERTIFICATION THE

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:24.203
MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:24.703

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.539
FORWARD DEFY ON THEIR THEIR

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:28.974
NETWORK ADEQUACY THE DELEGATED

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.043
ENTITIES AS WELL SO. THAT'S WHY

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:32.211
WE'RE GIVING THEM SOME TIME TO

00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:33.312
BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE PUT IN

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:34.780
PLACE THE SAME MECHANISMS WE

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:36.615
HAVE TO ENSURE NETWORK ADEQUACY

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:37.583
WHICH IS WHY WON'T GO LIVE

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:40.552
UNTIL JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:41.887
BUT THEN THEY WOULD DO THAT

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:42.488
ANNUALLY. AND THEN THROUGHOUT

00:18:42.554 --> 00:18:44.323
THE YEAR AS WE DO TODAY WE HAVE

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:46.625
A LARGE- MEDICAL GROUPS LEAVE

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:47.693
I'M IF IT'S A SET DATE

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:48.760
SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER WE HAVE

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.462
MECHANISMS FOR THE MANAGED CARE

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:51.029
PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT

00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:52.097
THAT TO THE DEPARTMENT.

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:53.499
DEPENDING ON THE THRESHOLD WE

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:55.634
WILL REQUIRE NOTIFICATIONS AND

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:56.969
PROCESSES FOR TRANSITIONING

00:18:57.035 --> 00:18:58.337
LIVES AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY

00:18:58.403 --> 00:19:01.507
WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ON

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:02.074
THAT IN IF THERE IS A CHANGE

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.375
THAT'S BIG ENOUGH. ON IT OVER A

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:04.743
CERTAIN THRESHOLD WE DO RE

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.144
EVALUATE NETWORK ADEQUACY

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:07.613
DURING THE YEAR WE WOULD BE

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:10.282
EXPECTING THAT SAME PROCESS OF

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:10.916
OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ON THEIR

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:12.184
DELEGATED OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.151
BASICALLY ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:14.419
WAS SURE HOW FREQUENT SO ANNUAL

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:16.622
CERTIFICATION PLUS NOTIFICAR

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:20.792
NOTIFICATION FOR LARGE. CHANGES

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:22.127
IN THE NETWORK OKAY. EIGHT AND

00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:25.097
THEN THE OTHER. I DO APPRECIATE

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:26.398
THE FACT THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:27.099
WE WANT ALL THE PLANS TO BE

00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:29.034
ABOVE AVERAGE LIKE LIQUID LIKE

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:30.402
WILL BE GONE RIGHT SO THAT'S

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:31.603
THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.605
EXPECTATION- APPRECIATE THAT I

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:35.641
KNOW THAT'S A HIGH BAR- SO I

00:19:35.707 --> 00:19:36.875
APPRECIATE YOU RECOGNIZING THAT

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:39.645
TO- I GUESS THE QUESTION EIGHT-

00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:41.847
JUST. REALIZING THAT THE WHAT

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:43.649
THE BAR IS AIDED BUT IS WHAT'S

00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:44.950
THE CONSEQUENCE FOR NOT MEETING

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:48.620
AT SO- I THINK IN THE PAST-

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:49.688
SOMETIMES THERE'S BEEN SOME

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.256
FRUSTRATION AND RECOGNIZES A

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:54.626
HIGH BAR BUT- THAT. THE

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:56.061
RESPONSE A DIFFERENT AGENCY

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:57.462
WHAT WE MONITOR THINGS I SAID

00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:58.697
WELL MONITORING IS GREAT BUT

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.265
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME FLOOR

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:02.134
WHERE IF YOU DON'T PERFORM AT

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.635
THAT LEVEL SO WHETHER TO FIFTY

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:04.436
PERCENT. SHOULD BE THE FLOOR

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:07.205
NOT. THAT THAT THAT SOME

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:09.007
SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES OCCUR

00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:10.809
SO I MEAN I THINK ON ONE LEVEL

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.911
YOU KNOW WE- AT I DO LIKE THE

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:14.813
YOU GET A CHANCE TO IMPROVE.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.848
BUT YOU KNOW HOW MANY CHANCES

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:20.519
YET BEFORE LIKE ALL RIGHT WELL.

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:22.421
YOU CAN THEN WE'RE NOT WORKING

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:26.224
OUT SO HOW DO YOU SEE TAT-

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:28.293
MOVING FORWARD IN TERMS OF

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.828
GOING BEYOND MONITORING AND

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.530
HAVING CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:34.066
HITTING PERFORMANCE TARGETS- SO

00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:36.602
WE- WE HAVE A VARIETY OF WAYS

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:37.703
IN WHICH WE DO THIS SO WE DO

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:39.438
HAVE A PROCESS WHERE IF YOU'RE

00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:40.739
UNDER CERTAIN THRESHOLD YOU DO

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:42.774
UNDER A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN-

00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:43.875
WHERE THE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO

00:20:43.942 --> 00:20:45.143
PUT TOGETHER ROBUST PLANS OF

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:45.944
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE THE

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:47.846
NEEDLE IN IN SEE IMPROVEMENTS.

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:48.680
THERE'S TARGETS THAT ARE

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:50.082
PUTTING THOSE CORRECTIVE ACTION

00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:51.783
PLANS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS AND

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:52.851
IF THEY'RE NOT MOVING THEM WE

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:55.354
DO REINFORCE THINGS WE HAVE THE

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.722
OPTION TO SANCTION IF WE GO

00:20:56.788 --> 00:20:58.056
THROUGH A CORRECTIVE ACTION

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:00.125
PLAN WE SEE CONTINUALLY OVER

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:01.026
TIME THAT THERE'S JUST NO

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.128
EFFORT BEING PUT IN. OFTENTIMES

00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:04.496
MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL STEP UP

00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:06.264
AND THEY WILL REALLY FOCUS ON

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:07.866
THE DEFICIENCIES WITHIN THE

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.701
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN TO HELP

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:11.169
MOVE THE NEEDLE ALONG THE

00:21:11.236 --> 00:21:12.170
DEPARTMENT PROVIDES A LARGE

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:13.672
AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:15.607
WE HAVE QUARTERLY MEETINGS WE

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:16.608
HAVE VARIOUS WEBINARS AND WAYS

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:17.643
IN WHICH WE SHARE INFORMATION

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.678
WITH. OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS-

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.446
WE DO TO TRY TO PROVIDE THAT

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:23.315
ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:24.883
WHEN NECESSARY- BUT WE ALWAYS

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.652
HAVE THE- THE ABILITY IT

00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:28.286
INTERNALLY TO IMMEDIATELY

00:21:28.353 --> 00:21:29.388
SANCTIONALSO IF IT'S SO

00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:31.823
EGREGIOUS ON ONE END OF THOSE

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.758
ARELIBERTIES THE DEPARTMENT

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:33.558
DOES HAVE IT REGARDS TO

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:35.193
EGREGIOUS ACTIONS BUT WE ALWAYS

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.395
TRY TO WORK WITH OUR MANAGED

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.562
CARE PLANS FIRST TO SEE IF WE

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:39.031
CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE. TO SEE IF

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:40.032
WE CAN MOVE THEM ALONG OVER

00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:41.433
YEARS TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.535
BEFORE WE MOVED TO SANCTIONS

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:45.337
BUT SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON THE

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:47.139
ACTION IT IS NECESSARY. WHEN A

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.940
COUPLE THOUGHTS ONE IS THIS

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:50.642
DOES CHANGE THE GAME ABOUT ALL

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:51.443
OF A SUDDEN THERE'S GONNA BE A

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.512
LOT MORE PLANS ARE GONNA BE

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:54.646
INVOLVED IN THAT CORRECTIVE

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:56.515
ACTION PROCESS AND SO REALLY TO

00:21:56.581 --> 00:21:58.250
RAISE THE BAR AND RAISE THE

00:21:58.316 --> 00:21:59.584
AWARENESS THAT OKAY NOW IT'S

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:00.819
THERE IS YOU'VE GOT IT FIFTY

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:02.654
MPL. SO I THINK THAT IS ONE

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:03.822
WILL JUST BE MORE ENGAGEMENT

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:05.624
AMEND THAT MORE ENGAGEMENT

00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:07.826
MEANS MORE PLANS INVOLVED IN

00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:09.294
THE DEPARTMENT MORE INVOLVED. I

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:10.529
THINK THE SECOND THING IS THAT

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:11.596
THE DEPARTMENT KEEPS YOU KNOW

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:12.864
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT OTHER

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:14.733
ALTERNATIVES WATER OTHER WAYS

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.069
THAT WE CAN MOTIVATE HELL PLAN.

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:18.870
TO DOES THAT BE YOU KNOW AND

00:22:18.937 --> 00:22:20.038
NOT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:24.109
COME. UP ANY PARTICULAR SALUTE

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.577
OCEAN JET BUT- AS YOU KNOW

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:26.178
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT.

00:22:26.244 --> 00:22:27.045
TO MOW. PEOPLE WE'VE CORRECT

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:27.913
ACTION PLANS AND SANCTIONS.

00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:28.847
OTHER OTHER WAYS TO THINK ABOUT

00:22:28.914 --> 00:22:31.717
HOW YOU MOTIVATE. PLANS TO

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:34.586
REALLY PUSH AS HARD AS THEY CAN.

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:36.855
YEAH I THINK THE SHEET THAT I

00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:38.356
THINK THAT ONE OF THINGS WE

00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:40.092
SHOULD ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:42.627
WE IS SERVE. MINIMUM

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:45.630
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS SO IT'S

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:48.366
LIKE WHAT WHERE'S THE LINE WAY

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:49.534
GETS EGREGIOUS RIGHT- SO

00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:50.969
WHETHER IT'S YOU JUST

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:53.071
PERFORMING SO BADLY THAT WE

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:54.473
GOTTA FIGURE OUT SOMETHING YOU

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:57.542
KNOW- OR- YOU SELLING LACK OF

00:22:57.609 --> 00:22:59.778
PROGRESS TO A MAYBE NOT AS BAD

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:02.013
SITUATION BUT WE EXPECT TO DO

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.216
BETTER AND YOU JUST DON'T WRITE

00:23:04.282 --> 00:23:05.283
SO. BE SURE THAT WE THERE ARE

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.186
SOME- CLEAR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT

00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:09.821
THAT I THINK WHAT. WE DON'T

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:11.490
WANT TO SEE IS THAT YOU KNOW

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:12.758
CORRECTION ACTUAL PLAN AFTER

00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:14.226
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN THAT

00:23:14.292 --> 00:23:15.093
DOESN'T CTUALLY LEAD TO ANY

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.796
CHANGE SO I GET OUT THAT'S- A

00:23:17.863 --> 00:23:19.498
SO I DO THINK THAT THAT'S THE

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:23.301
OVERSIGHT PART THAT- ZAP WILL

00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:26.371
ENSURE IS IN PLACE- THAT-

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:28.740
PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT- THERE.

00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:30.675
ARE CONSEQUENCES TO NOT AGAIN

00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:32.277
YEAH I DO THINK WE NEED TO

00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:33.178
THINK ABOUT WHERE WHERE DOES

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:35.547
CONSEQUENCE KICK IN. I DON'T

00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:36.715
WANT THE AND REASONABLE BUT

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:37.983
ALSO RECOGNIZING THOSE THOSE

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:39.751
ARE BEEN FISHERIES I MEAN WHEN

00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:41.453
THEY'RE NOT DOING WELL. THEN

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.622
THAT'S FULLER FALSE AND DIED IN

00:23:43.688 --> 00:23:45.857
I THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT- YOU

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:46.958
KNOW WOULD POINT OUT THAT FOR

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:49.194
EXAMPLE- ON THE CAPS SURVEY

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:51.630
GENERALLY. THOSE PLANS DON'T DO

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:53.365
VERY WELL AND THE MEDI CAL SIDE

00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:55.267
COMPARED TO UNION CAPS IS

00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:56.535
APPLIED ACROSS MEDI CAL

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:58.436
COMMERCIAL MEDICAID PROGRAMS WE

00:23:58.503 --> 00:24:02.774
DON'T KNOW WELL SO. WHICH THINK

00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:03.341
ABOUT LIKE WHAT WHY IS THAT

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:04.976
WHAT WE- THE END IT'S IT NEARLY

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:06.678
TO COME IT'S A SASSER. SURVEY

00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:08.346
WHITE WHITE OR MEDI CAL TO

00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:11.616
FISHERIES. THEM NOT FEEL AND

00:24:11.683 --> 00:24:12.784
THEIR PLANS ARE SERVING THEM

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:14.586
WELL WHEN. WHEN THAT SURVEY

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:17.122
COMES BACK AND WE GET ONE OR

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:18.223
TWO STARS ON THOSE PLANS ARE

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.625
FOR FIVE STARS. SO IT'S

00:24:20.692 --> 00:24:21.893
SOMETHING THAT- WE YOU KNOW WE

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.931
SHOULD BE. LOOKING AT- AS WELL-

00:24:25.997 --> 00:24:27.833
NOW WANT TO TOUCH ON RATE

00:24:27.899 --> 00:24:31.703
SETTING- SO- NOW AGAIN THREE

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.840
YEARS AGO WE HAD- NODES THE- A

00:24:34.906 --> 00:24:36.041
PRESENTATION ABOUT RATE SETTING

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:38.109
I APPRECIATE- AND WE GOT I

00:24:38.176 --> 00:24:39.778
THINK WE GOT A- POWER POINT-

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:42.614
ABOUT HOW. THE RATES ARE SET SO

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:44.616
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD THEN

00:24:44.683 --> 00:24:47.652
A GONNA ASK IT AGAIN NOW- SO

00:24:47.719 --> 00:24:49.788
FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD AN AUDITOR

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:50.722
REPORT THAT SHOWED.

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:54.492
UNFORTUNATELY AT. HALF OF

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:55.727
CHILDREN IN MEDI CAL WE'RE NOT

00:24:55.794 --> 00:24:58.430
RECEIVING THEIR- CHECK UPS

00:24:58.496 --> 00:24:59.931
RIGHT THERE TO WELTS THAT THE

00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:01.533
RECOMMENDED SUPER WELL

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.868
SUPERVISION VISITS TELLS

00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:04.169
FASCINATING ABOUT THE AUDIT

00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:06.504
REPORT WAS IS THAT. FOR THE

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:08.373
AGES AND WHICH WE WERE ACTUALLY

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.909
LOOKING ON THE OUSIDE THE

00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:13.144
AUDIT ON A REGULAR BASIS THE

00:25:13.211 --> 00:25:14.446
PERFORMANCE WAS MUCH HIGHER.

00:25:14.512 --> 00:25:15.914
IDEALS ABOUT 80% OR SO THAT A

00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:17.716
RELATIVE THAT WAS AND THEN ON

00:25:17.782 --> 00:25:19.351
THE OTHER AGES IT WAS A MUCH

00:25:19.417 --> 00:25:21.386
LOWER SO WHICH WOULD INDICATE

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:23.688
TO ME IS THAT IF THEY REALLY

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:26.625
WANTED TO. CONSOLES LOOKING

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:27.926
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SAID THIS

00:25:27.993 --> 00:25:29.194
SO IT'S AND SO WASN'T IN A

00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:30.762
POSSIBLE TARGET BECAUSE IT

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:31.463
SEEMED LIKE IF SOMEONE WAS

00:25:31.529 --> 00:25:33.398
COUNTING IT. THEY FOUND A WAY

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:34.666
TO GET IT UP TO A CERTAIN LEVEL

00:25:34.733 --> 00:25:36.635
AND WHEN NO ONE WAS WHEN.

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:39.137
PEOPLE WEREN'T LOOKING. IT WAS

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:42.574
DOWN OKAY SO THAT WAS THAT WAS

00:25:42.641 --> 00:25:44.309
A LITTLE DISTURBING BUT THE

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:45.710
OTHER THING THOUGH I ALSO

00:25:45.777 --> 00:25:47.779
RELATE TO RATE SETTING THOUGH

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:50.849
IS THAT WHEN WE DEVELOPED. THE

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.617
SO CALLED TAX SURELY ACCURATE

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:57.188
RATES. DO WE ASSUME. THAT ONLY

00:25:57.255 --> 00:26:02.427
50% THE KIDS ARE COMING. IN FOR

00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:03.028
THE REGULAR CHECKUPS. WHICH IS

00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:03.595
NOT WHAT WE WANT SO WHICH ME

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:04.796
ESSENTIALLY THAT'S WHAT WE-

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.431
THAT'S WHAT WE OFFERED TO PAY

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:09.634
FOR. OR DO WE SAY WELL ACTUALLY

00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:11.102
WE WANT ALL OF THEM TO COME IN

00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:12.537
AND- IF WE REALLY TRIED REALLY

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:15.640
HARD WILL GET 8590% AND THAT'S

00:26:15.707 --> 00:26:16.207
WHAT WE SHOULD ACTUALLY PAY

00:26:16.274 --> 00:26:18.877
FOR. AND MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE

00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:20.178
TO PERFORMANCE TARGET WE TAKES

00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:22.280
MONEY BACK OR SOMETHING OR YOU

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:23.248
KNOW THERE'S OTHER SUBSTANTIAL

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:25.717
SOLUTIONS TO SO. SO ONE ISSUES

00:26:25.784 --> 00:26:27.252
THAT I TALKED ABOUT THREE YEARS

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:28.553
AGO BALLOT BRING UP AGAIN IS DO

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.956
WE BAKE IN INTO OUR ACTUARIAL

00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:32.657
RATES ESSENTIALLY UNDER

00:26:32.724 --> 00:26:34.292
PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THAT'S

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:35.627
WHAT'S HAPPENED YEAH THAT'S OUR

00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:37.529
HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE RIGHT

00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:39.097
SO. ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE

00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:41.166
HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE AND SAID

00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:42.467
DO WE ACTUALLY BREAK THAT INTO

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:44.169
THE RATES WILL HAVE AS WE SAY

00:26:44.235 --> 00:26:45.670
THE RESOURCE WE GIVE YOU IS FOR

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:47.005
WHAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE PAST

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:48.239
NOT FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE

00:26:48.306 --> 00:26:49.541
FUTURE. PARTICULARLY WHEN

00:26:49.607 --> 00:26:52.510
THERE'S- WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE

00:26:52.577 --> 00:26:54.212
THERE'S AN UNDER UTILIZATION

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.914
AND SO I'M NOT INTEREST IN

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:57.649
TEACHING REALIZATION I WANT.

00:26:57.716 --> 00:26:59.751
LUSATIAN BUT LET'S JUST SO I

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:01.453
DOES NOT POSE. BECAUSE THAT

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:02.954
QUESTION IN TERMS OF HOW WE

00:27:03.021 --> 00:27:03.722
DETERMINE THE RATES THAT WE PAY

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:06.057
PLANS AND IT'LL AND WHAT GOES

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:07.092
INTO THIS ACTUARIAL

00:27:07.158 --> 00:27:10.462
ASSUMPTIONS- SO ACTUAR RATES DO

00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:12.163
HAVE TO BE PROSPECTIVE. BUT IT

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.732
IS DRIVEN BASED OFF OF

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:15.700
HISTORICAL UTILIZATION ON

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:17.669
THROUGH THAT KIND OF ACTUAR

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:19.070
RATE SOUNDING THERE IS

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:20.839
ABILITIES TO ACCOUNT FOR KIND

00:27:20.905 --> 00:27:23.608
OF EMERGING OR ANTICIPATED-

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:27.879
EXPERIENCE FOR EXAMPLE- WHEN WE

00:27:27.946 --> 00:27:29.447
ROLLED OUT THE VALUE BASED

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:33.318
PURCHASING. INITIATIVE PROFIT

00:27:33.385 --> 00:27:34.185
SIX SOON TO THAT THERE WILL BE

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:37.922
AN TWO. LET'S.BECAUSE NOW

00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:39.124
THERE WAS. HE PERFORMING

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.825
SCENTED. HISTORY PIECES THAT

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:41.626
THAT THE WOULD BE IN IN IN

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:43.028
UTILIZATION SO WHILE IT DOES

00:27:43.094 --> 00:27:44.262
HAVE TO BE ACTUAR EARLY SOUND

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:45.697
IT DOES HAVE TO BE REASONABLE

00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:47.632
APPROPRIATE ATTAINABLE. NEEDS

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:48.666
TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT

00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:49.667
PLANTS SHOULD BE PROVIDING

00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:51.503
PREVENTIVE SERVICES THEREFORE

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:53.138
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE. AS MANY

00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:55.907
HIGH COSTLY- SERVICES IT HAS TO

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:57.442
ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THOSE THINGS

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:59.277
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE CAN

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:01.146
ACCOUNT FOR IF WE FEEL LIKE IT

00:28:01.212 --> 00:28:03.348
WILL HAPPEN IN ACTUAL IMPACT ON

00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:05.350
THE RATE- YOU CAN MAKE

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:07.018
ADJUSTMENTS. WE WOULD NOTE THAT

00:28:07.085 --> 00:28:08.620
BASED ON THE PREVENTIVE AUDIT

00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:09.587
IN THE CURRENT WHAT'S CALLED

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:11.589
THE BRIDGE PERIOD WHICH IS THIS

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:12.690
EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD THAT WE

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:14.159
HAVE RIGHT NOW WE DID NOT MAKE

00:28:14.225 --> 00:28:15.627
ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON THE

00:28:15.693 --> 00:28:17.295
PREVENTIVE SERVICES. AUDIT

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:18.797
HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT IS

00:28:18.863 --> 00:28:20.198
LOOKING IN LIGHT OF BOTH VALUE

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:21.566
BASED AND TO THE ADDITIONAL

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:22.767
AUDIT THROUGH THIS RATE PERIOD

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:24.736
IF WE DO NEED TO MAKE AN

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:26.171
ADJUSTMENT GIVEN THE FACT THAT.

00:28:26.237 --> 00:28:27.772
IN IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR WE ARE

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:29.040
GOING TO BE PUSHING SIGNIFICANT

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:31.409
LETTERS OUT TO BENEFICIARIES.

00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:33.111
NOTICING THEM OF THEIR RIGHTS

00:28:33.178 --> 00:28:35.513
TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES- AND

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.281
THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGAGING IN

00:28:36.347 --> 00:28:38.383
SERVICES WE'RE GOING TO EXPECT

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:39.184
MANAGED. PLANS THROUGH THIS

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.752
YEAR TO THEN START ON A

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:42.954
QUARTERLY BASIS EVALUATING WHAT

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:44.189
PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND THEN DO

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:46.558
OUTREACH TO PROVIDERS ALL OF

00:28:46.624 --> 00:28:47.559
THAT IN RESPONSE TO PREVENTIVE

00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:49.094
SERVICES OUGHT. TO THE

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.395
DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING INTO

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:51.796
GARCIA SAID THE RATES FOR THE

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:57.135
NEXT YEAR WHAT WOULD BE. BOB WE

00:28:57.202 --> 00:29:00.305
NEED IT MAKE BASED ON THE FOR

00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:04.442
THAT THERE THE NUMBER. I'M XP

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:10.748
THAT WE POTENTIALLY BE IN. THE

00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:13.518
DOES THERE'S A OF AN SERVICE

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:19.657
ALL ADDING. CAN ACCOUNT FOR

00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:20.592
CERTAIN THINGS WITHIN THE RIGHT

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:21.659
IF WE SEE IT KIND OF COMING

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:23.161
AHEAD OF US OKAY CAN YOU KNOW

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:26.264
DR THE ITEM IN THE- WHEN YOU

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:27.432
THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW A PLAN

00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:28.600
PAYING FOR THINGS IT'S ALL

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.401
INTERRELATED SO THEY DO BETTER

00:29:30.468 --> 00:29:31.402
BRING IN KIDS FOR PREVENTIVE

00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:33.605
SERVICES. THEY RECOGNIZE ASTHMA

00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:35.340
EARLIER THEREFORE YOU DON'T

00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:37.008
HAVE THE EXPENSES OVER THERE IN

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:38.209
TERMS OF. A CHILD WITH ASTHMA

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:39.611
WHO HAS IN THE COMING IN FOR

00:29:39.677 --> 00:29:40.578
PREVENTIVE SERVICES GOING TO

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:42.580
THE ER. SO WHAT I THINK ABOUT

00:29:42.647 --> 00:29:44.048
THE RATES ALWAYS THINK OF ALL

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:44.849
THESE INTER RELATED BALANCING

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:46.851
THINGS. BUT ULTIMATELY IT IS

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:47.685
BASED TO SOME EXTENT ON

00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:49.721
EXPERIENCE AND SO I TOTALLY

00:29:49.787 --> 00:29:51.222
UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT. BUT I

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:52.824
THINK THE PLANS THINK OF IT AS

00:29:52.891 --> 00:29:54.692
IF WE DO THOSE THINGS. WERE

00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:56.060
BOARDING COSTS OVER HERE WHICH

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:57.529
WE'VE BEEN FULLY PAID FOR SO

00:29:57.595 --> 00:29:59.464
IT'S KIND OF. BOTH A LITTLE

00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:01.833
FUNNY YEAH AND THAT MIGHT BE A

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.836
LITTLE TRICKY. IN TERMS OF-

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:06.738
SAYING THAT TWELVE WE GOT. PUTS

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:09.641
A 80% OF ALL THE KIDS THOUGH

00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:13.178
FOR. GETTING TUTORED AT ONE.

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:14.112
WE'D LIKE TO THINK THAT MADE.

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:15.446
THE EYES OF A HOUSE WAS A WOULD

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:16.714
GO DOWN ALTHOUGH ONE COULD

00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:18.082
ARGUE THAT PERHAPS WHAT MIGHT

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:19.450
ALSO HAPPEN IS WE'LL SEE AN

00:30:19.517 --> 00:30:20.852
UPTICK IN UTILIZATION CERTAIN

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:22.053
OTHER THINGS THE BETTER DENTAL

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:27.759
FIGHT ENTREATED. SO YEAH DOES

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:29.594
THAT ALSO MAKE NOTICE SAM ONE

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:30.962
OF THE MAJOR INITIATIVES THAT

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:32.230
WERE ENGAGED IN IS TRYING TO DO

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:34.899
ASUS SCREENINGS RIGHT AND- WELL

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:35.800
THEY WILL HAPPEN OF RIGHT YOU

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:37.101
DIFFERENT SETTINGS OF CERTAINLY

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.437
IN KIDS- ONE OF THE BEST PLACES

00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:41.973
TO DO IT STRING WATER WHEN

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.541
WE'RE ONLY A 50% IN. YES WERE

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:44.809
MISSING A LOT OF KIDS WE HAVE

00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:46.211
OPPORTUNITIES SCREENINGS I MEAN

00:30:46.277 --> 00:30:48.046
NOT SAY WE CAN DO SOME OTHER

00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:51.082
SETTINGS AND SO FORTH BUT- BUT-

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:53.284
I THINK THAT- THAT'S- THERE'S A

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.385
TYPES OF VISITS WERE YOU

00:30:54.452 --> 00:30:56.020
REPRESS GOING TO SCREENING AND

00:30:56.087 --> 00:30:57.589
EVEN EVEN SOME INITIAL

00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:58.690
MITIGATION AND BUT THAT COULD

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:00.692
LEAD TO ACTUALLY FURTHER IF

00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:01.226
WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO

00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:02.860
ADDRESS THOSE FURTHER VISITS.

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:04.462
THAT AND UP. YOU KNOW SOME

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:05.797
OTHER UTILIZATION BUT WILL SAVE

00:31:05.863 --> 00:31:07.465
US MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. SO I

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:10.635
GUESS THE- THE- SO I A HERE

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:12.136
ABOUT THE BACK AND FORTH PRIME

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:14.639
CONCERN IS THAT WELL WE SAY THE

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.140
BACK AND FORTH BUT IN THE END.

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:18.109
IF THE PLANS AS WELL WE GO

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:19.344
THERE ARE ACTUAL REPEATS BASED

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.213
ON THE ONLY FIFTY PERCENT OF

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.815
KIDS COMING AND- I MEAN I GUESS

00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:24.983
IS A QUALITY MEASURE. THE DVR

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:26.584
WOULD THAT NOT SAYING THAT THEY

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:27.485
DID THAT'S THE MAIN THING

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:29.120
YOU'RE LOOKING AT BUT IT'S A

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:30.588
IT'S A SOURCE ADDS A LITTLE BIT

00:31:30.655 --> 00:31:32.824
OF A WRONG SIGNAL. RIGHT THAT-

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.260
THAT IT'S THE RATE ISN'T BASED

00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:38.363
ON AND- IT'S HARD TO SAY WELL

00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:38.963
IF I ACTUALLY GOT IT FROM 50%

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.698
80% THIS MUCH JOHN HAS MORE

00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:42.500
THESE CHRONIC DISEASES SO I'M A

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:43.968
LITTLE AFRAID TO SAY WELL

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:45.169
ACTUALLY THAT'S OR WASHES OUT

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:46.838
THAT YOU DO THIS. YOU KNOW

00:31:46.904 --> 00:31:49.073
WILL- THAT THAT IN FACT ONE

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.408
COULD EVEN ARGUE AND FROM A

00:31:50.475 --> 00:31:52.210
POLICY POINT OF VIEW. YOU KNOW

00:31:52.277 --> 00:31:53.745
DO YOU BUILD IN SOMETHING LIKE

00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:55.580
PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT.

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:57.482
SHOULD BE ON A REGULAR THING

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:58.850

COMING IN THE START WITHIN THE

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:53.304
ACT OR RATE THAN THAT BECAUSE

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:54.672

THE- YOU CAN CONTROL IT SIMPLY

00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:04.515
BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON THE A SIX

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:06.084
SCHEDULED THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.052
SOMETHING THAT YOUR TRADIO.

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:12.190

MEAN I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:15.860
IN I DON'T THINK PLANTS THINK

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:17.295
OF IT AS AN EXPLICIT TRADE OFF

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:18.696
RIGHT AND I AND I CERTAINLY

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:19.664
DON'T THINK PLANTS THINK OF IT

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:21.999
AS- I'M ONLY GETTING PAID 450%

00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:23.801
WELL CHILD SO THEY DON'T. BRING

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:25.737
KIDS IN WE NEED TO JUST MOE

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:27.538
THE PERFORMANCE OF AND I DON'T

00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:28.840
THINK I MEAN WITH I DON'T THINK

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:30.141
IT'S AS MUCH THE MONEY IS IT'S

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:32.176
THE PERFORMANCE AT THE BOTTOM.

00:33:32.243 --> 00:33:33.911
AND PROPERTY SIXES AS HELL

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:35.780
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAD IT YOU

00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:37.582
KNOW YOU HAVE TO THE CODES FOR

00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:39.217
THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES WHICH

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:40.551
WHICH YOU KNOW OUR PHYSICIANS

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:42.453
REALLY APPRECIATED. AND THAT'S

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.589
IT THAT'S A DRIVER KIND OF TO

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:45.456
ALMOST MITIGATE SOME OF THIS

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.959
TRADE OFF SOME OF THE TRADE OFF

00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:49.861
ISSUES THAT ARE THERE. BUT I

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:50.595
DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK THEY

00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:52.330
THINK LIKE THAT AT ALL WE JUST

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:53.798
HAVE TO DRIVE THE PERFORMANCE

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:54.866
YEAH THE ONLY THING I MEAN I

00:33:54.932 --> 00:33:56.467
AGREE JUST BECAUSE THE

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:57.635
UTILIZATION IS WAS DRIVING THE

00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:58.836
RAY WITH OTHER ASSUMPTIONS

00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:00.037
BUILT IN IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S

00:34:00.104 --> 00:34:03.374
WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING OF THE

00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:04.008
PLANS WE HAVE EXPECTATIONS THAT

00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:04.609
THEY PER. PREVENTIVE SERVICES

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:05.777
THAT THE REDUCING HIGH COST

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:07.278
UTILIZATION OF SERVICES IN

00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:08.079
GETTING PEOPLE INTO THE

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:09.881
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE SO I

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:11.816
AGREE ON THAT THOUGH IT THAT

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:13.584
HISTORY IS WHAT KIND OF BILLS

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:15.019
INTO THE RATE. THAT DOESN'T

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:16.387
CORRELATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:18.423
EXPECTATIONS OF THE PLANS AND

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:19.757
OR THE PLANS EXPECTATIONS IN

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:20.625
REGARDS TO GETTING THOSE

00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:24.262
INDIVIDUALS AT A SERVICES. THIS

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:25.163
IS A COMMON APPEAR. OPINION

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.697
THAT THE AGES ARE SO IT'S

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:28.032
COMPLICATED ABOUT WHICH KIDS

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:29.600
COME IN FOR CARE AND RICH KIDS

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:30.902
DON'T COME IN FOR CARE BUT- YOU

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:34.205
KNOW THE- WELL I DO IT DIDN'T.

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:36.374
YES ABOUT CIVIC NOTE FOR

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:38.376
EXAMPLE WAS- THAT. IF YOU LOOK

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:40.044
AT THE AUDIT THAT ACTUALLY WON

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:41.679
THE AGES FOR YOU SAW THE LOWEST

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:43.614
NUMBER OF VISITS I THINK WAS.

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:46.751
AS H. TWO THREE. WAS AGE TO.

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:48.152
THAT YET THAT'S BAD BECAUSE

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.287
THERE'S A LOT OF DEVELOPMENTAL

00:34:49.353 --> 00:34:50.855
CHANGES HAD ENGAGED TO AND THEY

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.523
WEREN'T LOOKING AT AGE TO SO IS

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.659
LOW AND THEN THE ONLY LOOK AT

00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:56.861
AGE FOUR AND THAT WAS. GOOD SO-

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.729
YEAH THAT OKAY YEAH THAT'S NOT

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.198
OKAY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE

00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:01.666
ADDED ALL OF THE CHILDREN AND

00:35:01.732 --> 00:35:03.301
ADULTS CORPS MEASURES TO. NOW

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:05.369
ARE SET SO THAT. IF WE'RE

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:07.572
MONITORING ALL OF IT HOLDING

00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:08.239
ACCOUNTABLE TO ALL HOPEFULLY WE

00:35:08.306 --> 00:35:09.574
WON'T SEE THOSE HUGE SWINGS

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.108
WHERE IF WE'RE NOT MONITORING

00:35:11.175 --> 00:35:12.910
IT. THERE'S NO THEM NO ACTION

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:16.481
OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT- IS IT I

00:35:16.547 --> 00:35:17.982
JUST EIGHTY AND MY OBSERVATION

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:20.051
IS THAT. WHEN SOMEONE'S LOOKING

00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:21.652
THEY SOMEHOW WE WERE ABLE TO

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:22.720
BETTER SO THE NET MUST KNOW HOW

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.655
TO DO BETTER. IT'S NOT A MATTER

00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:25.823
OF I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:29.560
IT'S LIKE I DOING IT OR NOT. SO

00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:30.862
NOW HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR.

00:35:30.928 --> 00:35:32.697
TOBY OVER HOPEFULLY WE'RE DOING

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:34.031
THINGS ELEVATORS WE'RE TRYING

00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:35.399
TO BUY. AND INSTALL THAT

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:36.901
UTILIZATION BUT SOMETHING'S IN

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:38.636
TERMS OF AGAIN THESE SO YEAH.

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:40.271
TRY TO GO WITH THE ACTUAR- RATE

00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:42.507
IS- HOW OLD CITY TAKE FOR

00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:45.176
CHANGES IN UTILIZATION TO SHOW

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:46.511
UP IN. THE DATA YET ENCOUNTER

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:49.747
DATA AND IT'S- INTO THE- CATION.

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:51.415
SO I'LL- HAVE TO DO SO WHEN YOU

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:56.320
TO. THE CAP. RATE. FOR THE PLAN.

00:35:56.387 --> 00:35:57.321
WHAT'S THE LAG TIME IN AND IF

00:35:57.388 --> 00:35:59.056
STILL LIKE TO. SO BASICALLY TRY

00:35:59.123 --> 00:36:00.124
TO FIGURE OUT LIKE HOW HOW WE

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:02.727
SHOULD INSTEAD OF. THE PLAN. TO

00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:04.362
SERVICE MY- FOR THE RIGHT WORD

00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:05.196
HOW DO WE SURE THE PLAN IS

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:06.731
ACTUALLY PAID APPROPRIATELY.

00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:07.431
FOR THE THIS IS THEIR

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:09.433
DELIVERING IT UNDER A CAPITATED

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.335
RATE DOES SO THERE IS A LAG

00:36:11.402 --> 00:36:12.870
BETWEEN DOUBT. THAT WE WANT

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.705
THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS AND

00:36:14.772 --> 00:36:18.042
YET WE'RE NOT PAYING FOR IT

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.676
BECAUSE WE HAVE A WE NOW HAVE A

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:20.711
LACK. SO THERE IS A TWO YEAR

00:36:20.778 --> 00:36:23.147
LACK FROM- ENCOUNTER DATA TO

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:24.448
THE UTILIZATION THAT'S BUILT

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:26.817
INTO THE CAPITATION RATE- BUT

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:28.786
AS I WAS MENTIONING EARLIER. WE

00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:30.688
DO HAVE PROCESS SEES THROUGH

00:36:30.755 --> 00:36:33.157
THE ACTUARIAL SOUNESS WHERE IN

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.992
ADDITION TO UTILIZATION WE CAN.

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:36.561
PRIOR TO SEEING IT COMING

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:39.430
THROUGH ON ENCOUNTER LOOK TO IF

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:40.731
WE KNOW WE'RE ROLLING OUT A BIG

00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:42.967
CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. WEEKEND

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:44.669
BUILDER FACTOR THAT INTO THE

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:46.070
RATE. ON IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE

00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:47.805
US A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS BUILT

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.674
AROUND IT TO- AND IT WOULDN'T

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.142
BE AS IF IT WAS YOU WERE SEEING

00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:52.343
IT IN THE UTILIZATION. THEY DO

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.145
HAVE THAT ABILITY BUT IT IS A

00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:55.813
TWO YOUR LOG IN REGARDS TO

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.481
ENCOUNTER DATA COMING IN AND

00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:58.816
THEN THAT BILLY BEING BUILT

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:01.652
INTO THEIR- INTO THEIR RATE.

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:02.219
PURSER THE SUPPLEMENTAL DATA

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:03.688
FOR US. THEY'RE VERY FREQUENTLY

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:05.923
WHEN WE SEE CHANGES OCCURRING

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:07.124
IN ANY PARTICULAR BENEFIT OR

00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:09.427
ACTIVITY. THE DEPARTMENT ASKED

00:37:09.493 --> 00:37:10.861
THE PLAN FOR SUPPLEMENTAL DATA

00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:12.263
REQUESTED A ROOM THAT ARE MUCH

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.831
MORE FREQUENT THAN. EVERY TWO

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.499
YEARS. AND THAT ALLOWS THAN

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:16.901
THOSE FACTORS TO BE TAKEN INTO

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:18.869
ACCOUNT. ON A MUCH MORE I MEAN

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:20.237
REAL TIMES LITTLE HARD BECAUSE

00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:21.606
OF THE TIME FRAME TO DO. THE

00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:23.307
ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS BUT A MUCH

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:24.875
MORE REAL TIME BASIS THAN TWO

00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:26.210
YEARS AND THAT IS WORKED. FOR

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:28.879
CERTAIN THINGS WELL. I THINK

00:37:28.946 --> 00:37:29.680
THAT'S WHERE THEY DO TRY TO

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:30.715
MAKE IT ADJUSTMENTS WHERE

00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:32.049
APPROPRIATE AND WHERE THERE'S

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:34.218
DATA OR SOME SINCE TO. TO BUILD

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:35.920
ON IT BUT- ON FULL HISTORY

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:38.589
UTILIZATION THERE IS THE LACK.

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:41.125
AND IN RELATION TO FOR EXAMPLE

00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:42.293
THE DOING THAT WITH THESE

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.327
PURCHASING OTHER TYPES OF

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:47.064
THINGS- IN TERMS OF THE- RISK

00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:48.466
FULL RIGHT OF ANNOUNCED THIS

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:49.834
YEAR BECAUSE IT'S ONLY WHEN

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.035
PLAN BUT IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:53.237
PLANS. IN THE COUNTY OR IN A

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:56.641
REGION- AND SUPPOSE SOMEONE

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:58.342
DECIDES A SIDE TO TAKE ON A

00:37:58.409 --> 00:37:59.610
VALUE BASED INITIATIVE THEY

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:01.078
ATTRACT MORE OF THE PEOPLE

00:38:01.145 --> 00:38:03.314
WITH. A CHRONIC CONDITION TO

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:06.684
THEIR PLAN. IS THEIR INABILITY

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.119
TO HOW LONG IT TAKES TO MAKE AN

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:10.187
ADJUSTMENT FOR. CHANGING CASE

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:14.492
MIX. BETWEEN THE- IN AN AREA SO

00:38:14.558 --> 00:38:16.293
WE GET THIS GOES BACK TO SAYING

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.662

PEOPLE FOR. ATTRACTING MORE

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:22.233
PEOPLE CRISES LAWS OF THE TAKE

BETTER CARE OF THEM. SO I DO

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:24.235
BELIEVE IN ME I WOULD WANT TO

00:38:24.301 --> 00:38:25.536
GO BACK AND CHECK WITH OUR TIME

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:27.505
TO BE A CERTAIN BUT THEY DO SET

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:28.939
AN ANNUAL RATE FOR THE YEAR AND

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:30.508
THEY DO LOOK AT THAT CASE MAKES

00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:32.410
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN REGARDS

00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:33.978
TO SETTING THOSE RATES BUT- I'D

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:35.246
WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK IN REGARDS

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:37.081
TO HOW THAT'S INCORPORATED-

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.083

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.151
CORRECT SO WE CAN GET YOU THAT

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:41.152
A OKAY SO YEAH I'D BE

00:38:41.218 --> 00:38:42.286
INTERESTED IN THAT AND ALSO

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:44.021
THINKING ABOUT WHAT MECHANISMS

00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:45.289
TO HAVE IN PLACE ESPECIALLY

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:46.991
WE'RE TRYING TO DO TRUE VALUE

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:47.525
BASED PURCHASING AND WE'RE

00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:49.260
ACTUALLY TRYING TO. PROVIDE

00:38:49.326 --> 00:38:50.728
BETTER QUALITY CARE PEOPLE'S

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:52.229
CHRONIC DISEASES AND YOU HAVE

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:53.798
LET'S SAY MULTIPLE PLANS IN AN

00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:55.299
AREA AND ONE PLAN ACTUALLY

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:57.368
STANDS OUT. AND MOST PEOPLE

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:59.170
KNOW THAT PLAN STANDS OUT THEY

00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:00.337
WANT TO ACTUALLY SIGN UP FOR

00:39:00.404 --> 00:39:01.972
THAT PLAN. AND ASK FOR THE

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:03.874
PLAN. THEY SHOULD BE THE PLAN

00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:05.910
SHOULD BE PENALIZED FOR PICKING

00:39:05.976 --> 00:39:07.945
UP PATIENTS TO MAY HAVE HIGHER

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:09.914
NEEDS. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.148
CRIED DISEASES IF THEY DO A

00:39:11.215 --> 00:39:12.283
GOOD JOB BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING A

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:14.151
GOOD JOB NOW. WE CAN ARGUE

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:15.986
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE. MAKE THEIR

CHOICES AND SO FORTH BUT IT'S I

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:18.989
THINK THAT'S PART OF VALUE

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:20.257
BASED PURCHASING THINGS SO THAT

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:21.492
THEY ACTUALLY PUT IN THE THINGS

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:23.527
IN PLACE TO. MAKE THEMSELVES

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:25.362
BETTER AT DOING AND BECOME MORE

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:27.498
ATTRACTIVE THAN. WE MIGHT WANNA

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:29.900
THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE NOT

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:31.435
PENALIZE A PLAN THAT.

00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:36.307
DISPROPORTIONATELY. TRACKS A-

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:37.875
LARGE DON'T. WITH MORE.

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:38.943
EXPENSIVE FOR. YOU KNOW

00:39:39.009 --> 00:39:41.479
CONDITION THAT MIGHT. BECAUSE

00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:42.046
OUR CASE MAKES A CHAIN RIGHT

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:43.414
THERE IS A RISK ADJUSTMENT

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:44.882
PROCESS IS PART OF THAT YOU

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:45.983
KNOW THE OVERALL RATE

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.519
DEVELOPMENT. RIGHT YEAH SO

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.755
EXACTLY HOW HOW HOW MUCH OF A

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:52.323
LAGGED THERE'S ON THAT TOO SO.

00:39:52.389 --> 00:40:00.831
ALL RIGHT. OKAY. AND THEN- THE

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.566
OTHER THING YOU KNOW WE AND

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:03.167

DOING TIME AND DISTANCE AND- WE

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:08.239
DON'T WE HAVE A AND HAD THE ODD

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:11.008
TO REPORT THAT LOOKED AT- IN

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.777
TERMS OF- AND DO TALK ABOUT THE

00:40:12.843 --> 00:40:15.613
REDUCTION IN THE DECREASE AND

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:16.147
I'LL SHOW FORGET THE TERM

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:19.283
ITSELF A YES THAT THE ALTERNATE

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:23.087
ACCESS STANDARDS SORRY. AND SO

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:26.257
IN TERMS OF RATE SETTING. THE

00:40:26.323 --> 00:40:28.025
HOUSE- HOW DOES THE RATE CITY

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:29.026
ACCOUNT FOR THE PLANS

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:29.660
REQUIREMENTS PROVIDE

00:40:29.727 --> 00:40:31.295
APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO CARE AND

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:33.664
PARTICULARS- ZIP CODE SO COUNT

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:34.899
FOR THE NUMBER AND GEOGRAPHIC

00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:36.801
LOCATION PLAN AND ALSO AND SO

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:38.335
FORTH SO IT SAID FACTORED IN

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:42.306
INTO THE- INTO THE- RATE

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:44.275
SETTING PROCESS IN TERMS OF-

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:45.876
WELL. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO FEEL

SPECIALISTS THERE IN THE AREA.

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:51.882
AND THAT MAYES SO I MEAN THE

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.384
RATES BUILT ON AN EXPECTATION

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:54.819
THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING ALL OF

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:56.120
THE SERVICES WE ARE CONTRACTING

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:57.988
WITH RIGHT FOR AN APPROPRIATE

00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:59.924
UTILIZATION BASED ON A NUMBER

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.326
OF FACTORS IN AND FORMULAS- AND

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.994
THEN BASED ON UTILIZATION

00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:05.396
EXPERIENCE FROM THAT MANAGED

00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:08.199
CARE PLAN- SO ESSENTIALLY IT IS

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:10.301
SOON AS THOSE THINGS BASED ON.

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:12.636
HISTORICAL PRACTICES NOW IF THE

00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:15.005
END IT DEPENDS IN ACCESS TO

00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:16.207
SERVICES THAN THAT WOULD SHOW

00:41:16.273 --> 00:41:17.975
UP IN FUTURE RATE SETTING BY

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:19.076
GUESS THE QUESTION IS LIKE OKAY

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:20.077
SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM TO

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:21.645
NOT DO AS MANY ALTERNATIVE

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:23.013
ACCESS RATES ON PEOPLE FAR AWAY

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.815
BUT THAT'S THEIR HISTORY IN THE

00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:25.816
PASSES WERE TRYING TO MOVE THEM

00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:27.518
ALONG. AND THEY MAY HAVE I

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:28.752
DON'T KNOW THEY'D BE THERE MAY

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:30.387
NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:33.290
BETTER RATES BY. FINDING

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.391
SOMEONE FARTHER AWAY. THIS IS

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:35.993
THE DOES THAT GET BAKED INTO

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.828
THEIR ACTUAR RATE IS THEY'RE

00:41:37.895 --> 00:41:38.729
LOOKING AT NOW THAT THEY WERE

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:39.930
TRYING TO MOVE THE FOR AT SO

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:41.198
I'M JUST AGAIN THINKING ABOUT

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:42.733
HOW THINGS MIGHT BE TO GET

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.601
BAKED IN OR NOT BECAUSE WE-

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.135
YEAH I REALIZE THAT. THE FORTY

00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:46.270
WE DON'T HAVE DEAL FALLS

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.038
PERSPECTIVES OFTENTIMES WE HAVE

00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:50.341
TO LOOK AT. THE DATA STRUGGLE

00:41:50.407 --> 00:41:51.709
DATA TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WILL

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:53.077
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE BUT SO

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:54.245
I'LL SAY ONE THING THEN YOU. SO

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:55.613
EVEN IF THAT SO EVEN IF IT'S

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:57.181
NOT LIKE IT'S ONLY WITHIN THAT

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:59.550
COUNTY- SPACERS ZIP CODE. THE

00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:00.851
PLAN IS RESPONSIBLE OF SERVICES

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:03.988
EVEN IF THEY HAVE COURTNEY SOME

00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:05.089
GOING UP YOU KNOW ACROSS THE

00:42:05.155 --> 00:42:06.891
STATE OR DROUGHT FAR. THERE

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:10.261
WERE. SERVICES GUARD LESSON SO.

00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:11.028
THIS IS THERE A- WOULD BE BILL.

00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:12.630
INTO THE RAY. IT EVEN IF THEY-

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:13.931
ULTIMATELY HAD TO PAY A HIGHER

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:15.532
RATE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAD

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.867
ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES. THOSE

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:18.636
WOULD EVENTUALLY BE BUILT IN-

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:19.436
SO IT IS EVERYTHING THEY ARE

00:42:19.503 --> 00:42:21.138
RESPONSIBLE FOR WITHIN THEIR

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.373
EVEN IF IT'S OUTSIDE OF THAT.

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:24.608

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:34.083
AND THE OTHER THING YOU ALSO

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:35.385
HAVE TO DO IS BE SURE THE

00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:37.487

DOCTORS INTIMACY MEDICAID- BUT

00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:03.746
THEY ALSO RECOGNIZE IN ORDER

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:05.114
FOR THE PRACTICE TO BE VIABLE

00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:06.783
THEY CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY. IT

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.252
WILL BE THE MEDI CAL PROVIDER

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:10.386
AND HAVE IT'S LARGER BECAUSE

00:58:10.453 --> 00:58:12.021

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:24.953
AND BOOM SORRY THE PLANS PAYING

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.554

AND ULTIMATELY OF COURSE MOST

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:38.132
IMPORTANTLY THE BENEFICIARY THE

01:25:38.199 --> 01:25:40.568
PATIENT TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:42.103

MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY WANT

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:47.876
SURE IT HAPPENS THE END. A

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:49.644
QUICK. THING OUT SO I WILL SAY

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:50.712

I DON'T HAVE TO ASK FOR PAR

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:08.263

THEY'RE GETTING MORE SO. COULD

01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:10.164

PROGRESS OF A PATIENT'S CARE.

01:26:57.645 --> 01:26:59.047

FIGHTER SO- THEN I GUESS THE

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:32.547
OTHER QUESTION I HAVE SO

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:34.282
ACTUALLY IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO

CARE ONE THE ISSUES I KNOW

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:39.253
THAT'S COME UP IS AN

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.122
INTERPRETER SERVICES RIGHT SO

UNFORTUNATELY ITIS IT HAS

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:56.704
SITUATION WHERE BASICALLY PLAN

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:58.306
SAID WHILE THE PATIENT ACTUALLY

01:27:58.373 --> 01:28:00.141
HAD TO SCHEDULE WITH THE

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.275
INTERPRETER WITH THE PLAN WE

01:28:01.342 --> 01:28:02.510
COULDN'T DO IT OF COURSE NOW

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:03.544
THAT THE PATIENT WHO DOESN'T

RIGHT TIME SO WE CAN ACTUALLY

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:22.964

JUST BEEN A CONTINUED PATTERN

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:57.965
ON THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM OUR

01:28:58.032 --> 01:28:59.701
COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND I THINK

01:28:59.767 --> 01:29:00.802
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN MAKE

01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:02.737
SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THERE IS A

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:04.906
AN ADEQUATE- WORK FORCE

01:29:04.972 --> 01:29:06.808
AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THESE-

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:08.342
INTERPRETATION SERVICES THAT

01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:10.278
ARE SO CRITICAL AND SO TIMELY-

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:10.878
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TAT ARE

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:13.881
ALL. ARE OF HIGH QUALITY- AND

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:15.249
YOU KNOW HOW THE- THE

01:29:15.316 --> 01:29:16.951
VERNACULAR AND NECESSARY TO

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:19.320
COMMUNICATE IS VERY COMPLEX

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:22.223
MEDICAL TERMINOLOGIES- CITY

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:23.891
CENTER WE CAN KIND OF BOOST UP

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:25.827
YOU KNOW THE- WORK FORCE IN AND

01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:27.595
MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS YOU

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:28.863
KNOW. FOR ONE THE

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:30.298
INTERPRETATION PHONE LINES ARE

01:29:30.364 --> 01:29:32.467
ALSO THERE SOMEONE THERE TO

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:33.968
ANSWER QUESTIONS IN A TIMELY

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:37.038
BASIS- ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:40.308
GET THAT CAN ACTIVITY IN REAL.

01:29:40.374 --> 01:29:42.110
IS SO I GUESS. FROM MY

01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:43.411
EXPERIENCE JERRY THIS IS LOW

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.379
ANECDOTAL BUT I MEAN I THINK

01:29:45.446 --> 01:29:47.014
THAT THE REASON WE SEXY CENTERS

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:48.249
NOT TRANSLATE THERE'S IS

01:29:48.316 --> 01:29:49.951
ACTUALLY YOU DON'T. NEED IT'S

01:29:50.017 --> 01:29:51.619
NOT A DIRECT TRANSLATION OF

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:52.687
WHAT THE PERSON SAID UNION

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.789
INTERPRETER WHO CAN CONVEY NOT

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:56.491
ONLY THE WORKERS BUT ALSO THE

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:58.326
TONE THE BODY LANGUAGE AND SO

01:29:58.392 --> 01:29:59.560
FORTH SO YOU CAN. BUT

01:29:59.627 --> 01:30:01.896
ULTIMATELY. SO WHEN WE FIGURE

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:03.631
OUT SO BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:05.566
ACTON. NETWORK ADEQUACY AND

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:08.970
RATE SETTING THIS SECTION. SO

01:30:09.036 --> 01:30:11.105
OBVIOUSLY NOT WELL SO THAT SO

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.140
IN TERMS OF MEDICAL

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:15.243
INTERPRETERS HOW DO WE- DOES

01:30:15.309 --> 01:30:17.945
THAT FACTOR IN IN TERMS OF. THE

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:19.147
PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:21.149
THEM CORRECT SO. SO HOW DO WE

01:30:21.215 --> 01:30:22.683
SEE WHEN WE DO RATE SETTING AND

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.819
NETWORK ADEQUACY DO WE HAVE

01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:26.721
STANDARDS AROUND THOSE LEVEL OF

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:33.327
INTERPRETING THAT'S- THAT. THAT

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:34.962
TO BAILABLE TO. AND IT. WAS

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:36.731
BELT IN THE- I MEAN THERE'S A

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:37.832
NEW CLASS BECAUSE THEY NEED BE

01:30:37.899 --> 01:30:55.650
PAID THEY SHOULD BE PAID.

01:30:56.584 --> 01:30:57.919
CONTINUE TO LOOK INTO IT TO

01:30:57.985 --> 01:30:59.053
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE EASY

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.755
ACCESS TO INTERPRETATION

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:02.056
SERVICES BUT YES IT IS BUILT

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:03.424
INTO THE TO THE MANAGED CARE

01:31:03.491 --> 01:31:04.292
PLAN MAKE ON THE ADMIN

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:06.661
COMPONENT OKAY AND I APPRECIATE

01:31:06.727 --> 01:31:07.762
TO GO. ALSO IN TERMS OF THE

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:10.231
LEVEL OF ACCESS TO THE INTER-

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:13.467
SO. AND THIS RECOGNIZING THAT-

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:15.736
WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS PUT THE

01:31:15.803 --> 01:31:16.971
BURDEN ON THE PATIENT. TO HAVE

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:17.905
TO FIGURE OUT HARD TO PATIENTS

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:19.707
FAIL THE I. T. CARE KIDS OF. TO

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:22.210
THE FAMILY TO HAVE TO SCHEDULE

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:23.778
THESE THINGS. WHEN THEY HAVE A

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:25.613
LANGUAGE BERIA STARTLE HAS

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:26.914
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:30.451
INTERPRETER FIRST PLACE- YES. I

01:31:30.518 --> 01:31:31.419
WOULD ALSO JUST ADD TO THE

01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:33.321
MPORTANCE OF INTERPRETERS IN

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:35.189
MENTAL HEALTH CARE- THAT IS

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:36.891
PROBABLY THE MOST. CRITICAL

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:38.926
COMPONENT OF ENSURING THAT YOU

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:39.861
KNOW INFORMATION IS BEING

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:41.429
SHARED AND YOU KNOW VERY

01:31:41.495 --> 01:31:44.131
SEAMLESSLY- WE KNOW THAT A LOT

01:31:44.198 --> 01:31:45.533
OF PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.501
HARMED BY YOU KNOW RECEIVING

01:31:47.568 --> 01:31:49.003
MENTAL HEALTH CARE FROM SOMEONE

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:50.705
WHO DIDN'T HAVE LINGUISTIC-

01:31:50.771 --> 01:31:52.473
SKILLS OR ON CULTURAL

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.008
COMPETENCY AND THEN THAT

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:55.543
PATIENT IS KIND OF FURTHER

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:56.510
TRAUMATIZE AND DOESN'T WANT TO

01:31:56.577 --> 01:31:57.445
COME BACK. TO SEE A PROVIDER

01:31:57.511 --> 01:32:00.047
SO- ENSURING THAT WERE- BE SURE

01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:02.516
WE HAVE CULTURAL COMPETENCE- IN

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:04.318
IN LINE WITH OUR OUR-

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:06.621
INTERPRETING. INTERPRETATION IS

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:09.690
IMPORTANT AS WELL. OKAY ALL

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:11.859
RIGHT AND THEN I KNOW- TODAY

01:32:11.926 --> 01:32:13.694
YOU HAD SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS IN

01:32:13.761 --> 01:32:16.731
TERMS OF- THE ISSUES AROUND

01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:18.399
THE- FEATURE WEAKENED UPPER

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:20.534
PERFORMANCE AROUND THE CHILDREN

01:32:20.601 --> 01:32:22.003
GETTING THEIR SCREENING AND

01:32:22.069 --> 01:32:25.840
PREVENTIVE SERVICES- INTO

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:26.674
WHETHER ANY ANY THOUGHTS FROM

01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:28.809
THE FARM ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:31.145
THINGS HE BROUGHT UP I MEAN I

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:31.879
KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT SOME IT

01:32:31.946 --> 01:32:34.248
EARLIER BUT AND THAT MEANS THAT

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:35.816
IN TERMS OF EXPLORING-

01:32:35.883 --> 01:32:38.286
DIFFERENT IDEAS TO. I THINK YOU

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:41.522
TALKED ABOUT A SET A SET ASIDE

01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:43.524
OR SOME AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:46.427
THEN WOULD BE IF THEY DON'T

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:49.797
FORM THAT WOULD BE. SO CHORE SO

01:32:49.864 --> 01:32:51.465
IT'S A IT'S A COMPLEX QUESTION

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:52.867
FIRST ANSWER TODAY AND THINK

01:32:52.934 --> 01:32:54.235
THE DEPARTMENT IS CONSTANTLY

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:55.269
LOOKING AND I THINK A BRIDE

01:32:55.336 --> 01:32:56.370
MENTIONED EARLIER DIFFERENT

01:32:56.437 --> 01:32:57.872
WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN

01:32:57.939 --> 01:32:59.674
INCENTIVIZE OUR PLANS NOT JUST

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:00.608
YOU KNOW THE SANCTIONS AND

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:01.642
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS WHICH

01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:03.577
ARE VERY NECESSARY SOMETIMES

01:33:03.644 --> 01:33:05.413
BUT WE ARE THINKING THROUGH A

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:06.914
VARIETY OF WAYS IN THE FUTURE

01:33:06.981 --> 01:33:08.115
TO THINK ABOUT RATE SETTING-

01:33:08.182 --> 01:33:09.850
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PIECES WE

01:33:09.917 --> 01:33:11.919
HAVE TO CONTEMPLATE FOR THOSE

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:13.387
TYPES OF DECISIONS. YEAH FULL

01:33:13.454 --> 01:33:14.789
DISCLOSURE MY AND I HAD THIS

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.424
CONVERSATION BEFORE I BECAME

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:18.492
THE DIRECTOR. OF THIS. SO I

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:19.727
THINK. I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:21.362
THINGS OF IN ONE IS WE'VE GOT

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:22.363
TO SIMPLIFY THE CURRENT RATE

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:23.597
STRUCTURE THE CURRENT RATE

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:25.166
STRUCTURES INCREDIBLY COMPLEX

01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:27.535
WITH THOUSANDS OF RATE CELLS. I

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:28.135
THINK WE'VE GOT TO GET TO A

01:33:28.202 --> 01:33:30.438
PLACE FOR. PAYING PLANS FOR THE

01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:32.673
SAME BENEFITS. YOU KNOW IN A

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.775
SIMILAR METHODOLOGY AND THEN

01:33:34.842 --> 01:33:36.444
THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO SAY.

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:38.646
HOW CAN WE GET CREATIVE ABOUT.

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:40.648
PAY FOR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE-

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:43.150
PRIMARY CARE SET ASIDE IS

01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:44.018
COMPLICATED BUT YOU KNOW I GET

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:46.721
THE POINT- SO I THINK I THINK

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:47.288
THIS IS THE TIME FRAME ISSUE

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:49.857
WE'VE GOT TO GET. WERE WAY TOO

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:52.393
COMPLICATED AT THE MOMENT.

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.095
RIGHT WELL LEAD TO HOPEFULLY

01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:56.063
DERBY CONTINUE DIALOGUE I KNOW

01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:58.065
THERE'S A- THERE'S ALSO A

01:33:58.132 --> 01:34:00.001
CHILDREN'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE

01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:01.836
FOR MEDI CAL TO- TO GET

01:34:01.902 --> 01:34:04.138
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT- SO.

01:34:04.205 --> 01:34:05.439
HOPEFULLY THEY CAN BE ENGAGE

01:34:05.506 --> 01:34:08.242
SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS WELL- I

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:09.510
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:10.745
YOU'RE- SAYING ABOUT THE

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.179
COMPLEXITY IN SOME SENSES HOW

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:14.148
DO WE SIMPLIFY. FIRST SIMPLIFY

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:15.349
SO THAT WE HAVE CLEAR SIGNALS

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:18.386
ALSO BECAUSE ONCE TOO COMPLEX.

01:34:18.452 --> 01:34:20.621
NOW ARE THE SIGNALS THAT WE

01:34:20.688 --> 01:34:23.758
SEND TO PLANS AND OTHERS- YOU

01:34:23.824 --> 01:34:25.059
KNOW GET LOST IN THE NOISE

01:34:25.126 --> 01:34:26.961
RIGHT SO WE CAN WE CAN PROVIDE

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:29.830
MORE. CLEAR DIRECTION AND

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:32.133
INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE AND IS-

01:34:32.199 --> 01:34:33.601
ALSO WITH THAT SIMPLICITY

01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:34.935
REDUCE THE OVER BUT THE

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:36.604
OVERHEAD BUT THEN FIGURE OUT

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:37.938
HOW DO WE BUILD AND THINK ABOUT

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:39.407
WHAT MECHANISMS WHO UP IN PLACE

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:40.574
THAT. WOULD BOTH BE

01:34:40.641 --> 01:34:43.044
ADMINISTRATIVELY PERHAPS- THIS

01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:45.079
STRAIGHT FORWARD AND CLEAR AND

01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:46.414
STILL ACHIEVE THE AIMS AIMS

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:47.615
THAT WE WANT BUT CERTAINLY

01:34:47.681 --> 01:34:48.949
HOPES WE CAN EXPLORE DIFFERENT

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:50.684
IDEAS AND HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:52.653
THAT. THIS IS NEAR AND DEAR TO

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.489
MY HEART. THANK YOU AND YES.

01:34:55.556 --> 01:34:57.024
YEAH I WOULD JUST ALSO ADD ONS

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:57.558
THAT IN TERMS OF

01:34:57.625 --> 01:34:59.193
CONSIDERATIONS- WE'VE SEEN

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.428
GREAT PROMISE WITH THE USE OF

01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:01.896
COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND

01:35:01.962 --> 01:35:03.330
REALLY KIND OF UTILIZING THEM

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:04.365
TO BUILD THOSE BRIDGES BETWEEN

01:35:04.432 --> 01:35:06.734
THE PLANTS BETWEEN PROVIDERS-

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:07.968
AND REALLY IMPROVING. ON

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:10.237
DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES-

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:11.839
SO WE WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND

01:35:11.906 --> 01:35:13.240
KIND OF BUILDING THAT INTO THE-

01:35:13.307 --> 01:35:15.176
KIND OF THE NATURE OF HOW HOW

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:16.844
CARE IS DELIVERED- AND THEN

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:18.079
ALSO ASKING THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:35:18.145 --> 01:35:18.913
RELEASE THAT YOU KNOW

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:20.247
AGGRESSIVE TARGETS FOR.

01:35:20.314 --> 01:35:22.416
DISPARITY REDUCTION- AND

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:23.984
UTILIZING THESE CREATIVE MODELS

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:25.719
TO BRING IN COMMUNITY PARTNERS

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:27.088
YOU KNOW LOOKING AT POPULATION

01:35:27.154 --> 01:35:29.323
HEALTH MANAGEMENT. IN

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.824
COORDINATION WITH LOCAL

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:31.325
STAKEHOLDERS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:32.660
THOSE DEALERS- STRATEGY SHOULD

01:35:32.726 --> 01:35:34.595
BE AND THEN. YOU KNOW PROVIDING

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:37.598
BONUSES FOR YOU KNOW GOOD

01:55:30.089 --> 01:55:32.158
CONCERNED THAT WE EXPECT EACH

INDIVIDUAL MANAGED CARE PLANS

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:34.794
TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:38.898
CORONATION CARES OF WHAT THE

01:55:38.965 --> 01:55:41.267
WONDER BIGGEST ISSUES. IS THAT

01:55:41.334 --> 01:55:43.069
THEY NEED PEDIATRIC

01:55:43.136 --> 01:55:45.071
SUBSPECIALTY CARE WHICH IS. NOT

01:55:45.138 --> 01:55:48.308
PRESENT IN EVERY COUNTY THAT IS

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:49.275
IN FACT ACTUALLY MEAN I MEAN.

01:55:49.342 --> 01:55:50.777
YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA BIG STATES

01:55:50.843 --> 01:55:51.711
SOMEWHERE IN THE STATE

01:55:51.778 --> 01:55:53.246
HOPEFULLY BUT SOMETIMES MAY

01:55:53.313 --> 01:55:54.847
EVEN NEED CARE THAT OUTSIDE OF

01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:56.482
THE STATE IF THEY HAVE A REALLY

01:55:56.549 --> 01:55:59.385
SPECIALIZED CONDITION. AND SO.

01:55:59.452 --> 01:56:01.287
THAT SO WE'RE TALKING INTENSIVE

01:56:01.354 --> 01:56:02.722
TOUCH WHICH IS PERHAPS A LITTLE

01:56:02.789 --> 01:56:04.457
DIFFERENT THAN LET'S SAY

01:56:04.524 --> 01:56:06.459
SOMEONE WHO'S HOMELESS. WHO

01:56:06.526 --> 01:56:08.127

BUT- DEAD BUT THOSE SERVICES

01:56:13.433 --> 01:56:15.935
MAY BE MORE AVAILABLE. WITHIN

01:56:16.002 --> 01:56:17.570
THEIR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:20.106
THEREFORE FOR A HEALTH PLAN THE

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:21.474
MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN.

01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:23.209
CONTRACTING FOR THAT MEAL MAY

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:25.044
INVOLVE CORNY COUNTY AND SOME

01:56:25.111 --> 01:56:25.745
OTHER TYPES OF STUFF THE NON

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:28.047
PROFITS. BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:56:28.114 --> 01:56:29.482
WITH ANSWER THE CATCHMENT AREA

01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:32.985
THAT THE PLAN. NORMALLY

01:56:33.052 --> 01:56:33.586
OPERATES AND SO. NOW THAT MAY

01:56:33.653 --> 01:56:34.620
HAVE SO THEIR OWN. IN TRYING TO

01:56:34.687 --> 01:56:36.022
PROVIDE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BUT

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:36.823
THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN

01:56:36.889 --> 01:56:38.591
SAYING WELL I A NOW NEED A

01:56:38.658 --> 01:56:40.360

THAT ONLY EXISTS IN BOSTON AND

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:46.366
SAN FIERRO SAN FRANCISCO. AND

01:56:46.432 --> 01:56:48.701
ON THE PLAN. DID YOU KNOW DOWN

01:56:48.768 --> 01:56:50.970
AND KERN ERROR UP AND YOU KNOW.

01:56:51.037 --> 01:56:52.939
ARE AT THE KERN DOES A GREAT

01:56:53.005 --> 01:56:54.307
JOB BUT AS THE DAY WERE HERE

01:56:54.374 --> 01:56:55.341
SITES ARE PICKED ON A LITTLE

01:56:55.408 --> 01:56:56.909
BIT BUT OUR VIEW NO ONE THE GMC

01:56:56.976 --> 01:56:58.711
PLANS IN SACRAMENTO AND BEEN

01:56:58.778 --> 01:56:59.746
FORTUNE WE CAN'T PROVIDE IT

01:56:59.812 --> 01:57:01.280
THAT'S IT UC DAVIS WHICH IS

01:57:01.347 --> 01:57:04.851
STILL TERTIARY CARE CENTER. SO

01:57:04.917 --> 01:57:06.419
I GUESS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT NOW

01:57:06.486 --> 01:57:08.454
WE FRAGMENTED THIS AMONGST ALL

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:09.355
THESE DIFFERENT PLANS IN EACH

01:57:09.422 --> 01:57:11.491
pTRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:13.059
CONTRACT WITH THESE VERY RARE

01:57:13.126 --> 01:57:16.095
SUB SPECIALISTS. AND IN FACT

01:57:16.162 --> 01:57:17.130
MOST F THE POLICY EXPERTS

01:57:17.196 --> 01:57:18.064
WOULD SAY ACTUALLY SHOULD

01:57:18.131 --> 01:57:19.132
REGIONALES TO CARE FOR THOSE

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:21.334
PEOPLE SO THAT'S DIFFERENT SO I

01:57:21.401 --> 01:57:23.369
WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW SO. SO

01:57:23.436 --> 01:57:24.203
I'M JUST CONCERNED WERE MIXING

01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:26.439
UP OF THIS OF THIS CONCEPT OF

01:57:26.506 --> 01:57:28.408
ENHANCE CARE I AM ALL ON BOARD

01:57:28.474 --> 01:57:30.143
WITH SOUNDS GREAT. I WILL BE

01:57:30.209 --> 01:57:32.011
SURE WITHIN THAT POPULATION ARE

01:57:32.078 --> 01:57:33.146
WE PROVIDING THE RIGHT KIND OF

01:57:33.212 --> 01:57:35.248
STRUCTURE FOR THAT SO WE'RE

01:57:35.314 --> 01:57:36.215
TALKING ABOUT LIKE WE NEED TO

01:57:36.282 --> 01:57:38.484
ENHANCE. LIKE PROVIDE

01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:40.420
ADDITIONAL SAYS NO BETTER

01:57:40.486 --> 01:57:42.021
COORDINATION BETWEEN HEALTH

01:57:42.088 --> 01:57:44.056
CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND

01:57:44.123 --> 01:57:46.325
HOUSING AND SO FORTH. THE

01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:48.661
ABSOLUTE VERSES I NEED HIGHLY

01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:51.030

SERVICES THAT ARE IN MY

01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:56.402
GEOGRAPHIC AREA BUT NOW WE'RE

01:57:56.469 --> 01:57:57.870
GIVING IT UP. THAT'S WHERE

01:57:57.937 --> 01:57:59.205
PERHAPS IT MAKES MORE SENSE FOR

01:57:59.272 --> 01:58:00.706
THE STATE OPERATE AS A WHOLE

01:58:00.773 --> 01:58:02.642
THEN TO FARM IT OUT CONTRACT

01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:04.143
OUT TO GUESS WHAT OH BY THE WAY

01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:05.311
YOU JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A KID

01:58:05.378 --> 01:58:11.184
BUT THE SPED RAREST. CONDITION.

01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:11.784
IT'S YOUR JOB TO TAKE CARE OF

01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:12.418
THEM. OKAY NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE

01:58:12.485 --> 01:58:13.553
OUT HOW TO. DEAL WITH THIS VERY

01:58:13.619 --> 01:58:17.457
UNUSUAL SITUATION SITUATION. SO

01:58:17.523 --> 01:58:19.292
WHAT I WOULD DIFFERENTIATE THE

01:58:19.358 --> 01:58:21.427
MEDICAL CARE DELIVERY FROM THE

01:58:21.494 --> 01:58:24.530
CARE MANAGEMENT SO YOUR EXAMPLE

01:58:24.597 --> 01:58:26.232
HAVING SENT SOMEONE TO JOHN SAW

01:58:26.299 --> 01:58:27.433
CHILD TO JOHNS HOPKINS FOR

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:30.169
EXAMPLE- CCS PROGRAM DOESN'T

01:58:30.236 --> 01:58:31.170
CHANGE OTHER THAN YOU KNOW

01:58:31.237 --> 01:58:32.438
WORDS ARE ANY CHANGE IN THE

01:58:32.505 --> 01:58:34.207
WHOLE CHILD MODEL. SO FROM THE

01:58:34.273 --> 01:58:35.975
MEDICAL CARE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW

01:58:36.042 --> 01:58:37.510
YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE CARE TO THE

01:58:37.577 --> 01:58:40.146
CHILDREN. NOT REALLY CHANGING

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:41.314
IN THAT SENSE SO JUST TO

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:42.882
CLARIFY SO THIS IS THAT A GOOD

01:58:42.949 --> 01:58:44.917
THROUGH SEUSS THREE CCS MOST

01:58:44.984 --> 01:58:46.052
CASES THEY WOULD GO THROUGH CCS

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:47.587
THE EXAMPLE I GAVE WAS VERY

01:58:47.653 --> 01:58:49.288
COMPLICATED AND THERE WAS HE

01:58:49.355 --> 01:58:50.022
SAID YOU KNOW TRY TO FIGURE

01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:51.958
OUT. WHAT WE'RE NOW ON THE

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:53.860
CHILDREN AREA IS YOU PROVIDE

01:58:53.926 --> 01:58:55.094
THE CARE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

01:58:55.161 --> 01:58:56.729
SURE THAT KID GETS TO THE CARE

01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:58.431
WHETHER IT'S CCS WHETHER IT'S

01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:00.266
PLAN RESPONSIBILITY SO YOU'D BE

01:59:00.333 --> 01:59:01.834
WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE CCS

01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:03.836
AGENCY IF THE CHILD AS SERIOUS

01:59:03.903 --> 01:59:05.771
MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE

01:59:05.838 --> 01:59:06.572
ISSUES YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:09.175
COUNTY. SO YOU THAT CENTRAL HUB

01:59:09.242 --> 01:59:12.345
AT A VERY FACE TO FACE VERY

01:59:12.411 --> 01:59:13.346
HIGH TOUCH MODEL MAKING SURE

01:59:13.412 --> 01:59:14.881
THAT THE CHILD GOES WHEREVER

01:59:14.947 --> 01:59:17.083
THEY NEED TO GO. THAT RESPOND

01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:18.584
THAT FUNCTIONALITY TO SOME

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:20.119
EXTENT IS THE PLANS NOW IS AT A

01:59:20.186 --> 01:59:21.954
HIGHER LEVEL BUT YOUR POINT

01:59:22.021 --> 01:59:24.090
ABOUT IT THE KIND OF SERVICES

01:59:24.156 --> 01:59:25.291
IN THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:59:25.358 --> 01:59:26.425
GONNA PROVIDE SERVICES TO

01:59:26.492 --> 01:59:28.027
HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL IS

01:59:28.094 --> 01:59:30.363
ABSOLUTELY WELL TAKEN AND

01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:32.431
THAT'S THE KEY SO FOR EXAMPLE.

01:59:32.498 --> 01:59:34.534
I'M THINKING PLANS TO REALLY

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:35.701
THINK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING

01:59:35.768 --> 01:59:36.569
TO RELATE AND TAKE CARE OF

01:59:36.636 --> 01:59:37.637
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS THEY'RE

01:59:37.703 --> 01:59:38.638
GONNA TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY

01:59:38.704 --> 01:59:40.206
AGENCIES THAT HAVE THAT

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:41.874
EXPERIENCE OF GOING TO THE

01:59:41.941 --> 01:59:43.543
STREET HELPING TO FIND THAT

01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:45.044
PERSON BUT THEN IT'S GOT IT

01:59:45.111 --> 01:59:46.145
THEN YOU GOT TO HAVE THE

01:59:46.212 --> 01:59:47.146
INTERFACE RIGHT BACK WITH THE

01:59:47.213 --> 01:59:48.314
PLAN TO GET ON THE CARE THEY

01:59:48.381 --> 01:59:50.516
NEED. A HAND OR TO FIGURE OUT

01:59:50.583 --> 01:59:52.051
YOUR OPTIONS AROUND HOUSING AND

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:54.320
OR TO FIGURE OUT ANYTHING ELSE

01:59:54.387 --> 01:59:56.689
OF THAT PERSON NEEDS SO YOUR

01:59:56.756 --> 01:59:57.490
POINT IS VERY WILL TELL. EACH

01:59:57.557 --> 01:59:59.659
OF THE POPULAR TUNES IS GONNA

01:59:59.725 --> 02:00:01.160
TAKE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

02:00:01.227 --> 02:00:03.129
WORK IS GOING TO TAKE

02:00:03.195 --> 02:00:04.397
SPECIALIZED INDIVIDUALS OR

02:00:04.463 --> 02:00:05.631
GROUPS OR ENTITY THESE

02:00:05.698 --> 02:00:06.966
PARTICULAR COMMUNITY ENTITIES

02:00:07.033 --> 02:00:09.569
OR COUNTIES THAT CAN HELP. BUT

02:00:09.635 --> 02:00:11.470
IT DOESN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE

02:00:11.537 --> 02:00:12.939
THE MEDICAL CARE DELIVERY

02:00:13.005 --> 02:00:18.878
RESPONSIBILITY. SO YOUR.

02:00:18.945 --> 02:00:19.979
EXAMPLE WITH THE CHILD NINE

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:20.813
NINE TIMES OUT OF A HUNDRED BE

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:23.082
A CEASE. KID BUT THE PLAN GOT

02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:24.383
THIS CARE MAY. THAT'S MAKE A

02:00:24.450 --> 02:00:25.017
SURE WE'RE WITH CITIES US. THE

02:00:25.084 --> 02:00:26.052
DUTCH SHELL GETS AT THE NEED.

02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:28.421

02:01:06.258 --> 02:01:07.793
EXPECTED TO DO THE SAME THING

02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:09.528
AND EXCEPT THAT NOW THEY HAVE

02:01:09.595 --> 02:01:10.730
THIS POPULATION THAT ONE HAS

02:01:10.796 --> 02:01:11.964
THAT PART YOU KNOW THIS MANAGE

02:01:12.031 --> 02:01:16.235
YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE SIGNED.

02:01:16.302 --> 02:01:17.603
UP AND SO HOW HOW. THEN YOU

02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:19.238
HAVE A KEY THE DROP. WELL THE

02:01:19.305 --> 02:01:20.339
BE MOST COUNTIES THAT MEET A

02:01:20.406 --> 02:01:21.674
COUNTY AND SO IT'S DOESN'T

02:01:21.741 --> 02:01:25.144
MAKE. MORE SENSE FOR EACH PLAN

02:01:25.211 --> 02:01:27.847
TO HAVE TO DO THIS SEPARATELY

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:30.116
FOR THE THEIR SUBPOPULATION-

02:01:30.182 --> 02:01:31.917
AND IF YOU HAVE. A LOT OF PLANS

02:01:31.984 --> 02:01:33.686
AND GET EVEN SUBDIVIDED MORE

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:35.721
VERSES. WHAT'S INTERFACE WITH A

02:01:35.788 --> 02:01:37.657
BETWEEN. THE COUNTY WHICH IS A

02:01:37.723 --> 02:01:38.758
RESPONSIBILITY FOR A LOT OF

02:01:38.824 --> 02:01:40.726
THESE DIFFERENT SERVICES- ON

THE SOCIAL SERVICE SIDE. AND

02:01:42.662 --> 02:01:45.998
THE- AND THE PLAN IN TERMS OF

WHO'S- WHO'S- RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:01:48.868 --> 02:01:51.303
THE CORONATION THESE VARIOUS-

02:01:51.370 --> 02:01:52.405

MANAGEMENT SERVICES. FIRST I

02:01:54.407 --> 02:01:55.207
THINK THE BIGGEST THING TO

REMEMBER ABOUT ENHANCE YOUR

02:01:56.509 --> 02:01:57.843
MANAGEMENT IS ACTUALLY NOT A

02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:59.412

EXAMPLE THE WHOLE PERSON CARE

02:02:08.087 --> 02:02:10.089
PILOTS TODAY OFTEN RUN BY

02:02:10.156 --> 02:02:12.091
PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS OR

02:02:12.158 --> 02:02:14.160
COUNTY ENTITIES WE WOULD STILL

02:02:14.226 --> 02:02:15.428
EXPECT THAT. WHILE THEY'RE

02:02:15.494 --> 02:02:16.662
DOING THEIR WHOLE PERSON CARE

02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:18.097
TODAY THEY WOULD ALSO BECOME

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:19.298
ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT

02:02:19.365 --> 02:02:20.866

WOULD BE CONTRACTING. WITH

02:02:22.702 --> 02:02:24.503
THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT IT

02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:26.205
IT THERE'S TWO PLANS I'M GONNA

02:02:26.272 --> 02:02:27.406
KEEP IT SIMPLE AND A TWO TWO

02:02:27.473 --> 02:02:28.541
PLANS WHEN COUNTY BECAUSE GMC

02:02:28.607 --> 02:02:29.875
IS I AGREE MORE COMPLICATED

02:02:29.942 --> 02:02:32.378
WITH ALL OF THE PLANS- BUT- YOU

02:02:32.445 --> 02:02:34.013
KNOW. WERE HOPING THAT BOTH

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:36.182
PLANS IN EXAM AND THAT EXAMPLE

02:02:36.248 --> 02:02:37.583
ON BOTH PLANS WOULD HAVE A

02:02:37.650 --> 02:02:38.884
CONTRACT WITH THAT ENHANCE CARE

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:40.720
MANAGEMENT PROVIDER. WHO HAS A

02:02:40.786 --> 02:02:42.722
MODEL OF CARE WHO IS SPECIFIC

02:02:42.788 --> 02:02:44.990
TO THE HOMELESS POPULATION OR

02:02:45.057 --> 02:02:46.759
THE CHILDREN OR WOOD OR THE

02:02:46.826 --> 02:02:48.327
TRANSITIONS OUT OF LNG TERM

02:02:48.394 --> 02:02:49.328
CARE SO THEY WILL HAVE A BROAD

02:02:49.395 --> 02:02:51.163
BASED. VARIETY OF PEOPLE THAT

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:52.364
THEY ARE CONTRACTING WITH

02:02:52.431 --> 02:02:53.632
DEPENDING ON THE EXPERTISE THAT

02:02:53.699 --> 02:02:55.501
THEY BRING TO THE VARIOUS TOP

02:02:55.568 --> 02:02:58.571
TARGET POPULATIONS- AT AND-

02:02:58.637 --> 02:02:59.805
MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL HAVE TO

BE PRETTY INVOLVED INTO SURE

02:03:01.307 --> 02:03:02.475
THAT THERE IS A GOOD MODEL OF

02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:05.044
CARE IN PLACE- BUT- THAT IS

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:05.978
WHERE WE GET OUR FEDERAL.

02:05:43.135 --> 02:05:45.804
THAT- IT IS VERY COMPLEX AND SO

02:05:45.871 --> 02:05:46.772
WE DO HAVE KIND OF A- LONGER

02:05:46.839 --> 02:05:49.141

KNOW FIRST HALF WE TALKED ABOUT

02:07:31.643 --> 02:07:33.612
RATE SETTING HE TALKED ABOUT

02:07:33.679 --> 02:07:35.381
HOW HE ESTABLISHED CAPITATION

02:07:35.447 --> 02:07:37.182
RATES BASED ON HISTORICAL AND

02:07:37.249 --> 02:07:39.318
SOME THE TOWNS WITH THAT AND SO

02:07:39.385 --> 02:07:41.820
FORTH- OBVIOUSLY THAT SHOULD

02:07:41.887 --> 02:07:43.155
NOT STOP US FROM DOING

02:07:43.222 --> 02:07:45.224
SOMETHING NEW BUT HOW DO YOU

02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:49.161
PLAN TO ESTABLISH RATES FOR CAL

02:07:49.228 --> 02:07:50.529
AMY WERE NOW THE PLANS ARE

02:07:50.596 --> 02:07:53.032
TAKING ON THIS. I MEAN ARE WE

02:07:53.098 --> 02:07:56.068
GOING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF- ANY

02:07:56.135 --> 02:07:56.902
SOME OF THIS IS GOING TO BE A

02:07:56.969 --> 02:07:58.103
LITTLE BIT GASSING BECAUSE

02:07:58.170 --> 02:07:59.471
WE'RE ASKING PROVIDE SERVICES

02:07:59.538 --> 02:08:01.340
AT AND PREVIOUSLY BEEN PROVIDED

02:08:01.407 --> 02:08:02.941
BY THE PLANS WE CAN PROBABLY

02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:04.109
PRICE OF HOW THEY WERE PROVIDED

02:08:04.176 --> 02:08:06.111
BY OTHER PEOPLE ETCETERA I MEAN

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:08.280
ARE WE GOING TO IS TO GIVE ME

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:09.381
SOME SORT OF LIKE SECONDARY

02:08:09.448 --> 02:08:12.084
RISK BUFFERING OR RECORDER RAIN

02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:14.019
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO THAT-

02:08:14.086 --> 02:08:15.921
WE DON'T WANT PLANS BASICALLY

02:08:15.988 --> 02:08:18.257
FINDING THEMSELVES. LIKE MISS

02:08:18.323 --> 02:08:20.325
GUESSING AND AGREEING TO A RATE

02:08:20.392 --> 02:08:21.560
THAT THEN THEY CAN ACTUALLY

02:08:21.627 --> 02:08:24.396
DELIVER AND- I MEAN IT BECAUSE

02:08:24.463 --> 02:08:25.898
IT'S A REALLY BIG PLAN THEY CAN

02:08:25.964 --> 02:08:27.099
DRAW SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT

02:08:27.166 --> 02:08:29.435
IT'S- COUNTY PLAN THAT DOESN'T

02:08:29.501 --> 02:08:31.403
HAVE ANY OTHER SERVICE LINES

02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:32.871
AND WHATHAPPENS THERE STRUCK

02:08:32.938 --> 02:08:34.173
STUCK WITH THE LLAMA ABOUT

02:08:34.239 --> 02:08:35.507
SAYING WELL WHAT WE TRY TO CUT

02:08:35.574 --> 02:08:37.142
CORNERS BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T

02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:39.178
HAVE THE MONEY OR SOMETHING SO

02:08:39.244 --> 02:08:40.112
HE WHAT KIND OF THINGS DO WE

02:08:40.179 --> 02:08:41.447
SEE. IN TERMS OF BOTH

02:08:41.513 --> 02:08:45.451
ESTABLISHING RATE. BUT THEN

02:08:45.517 --> 02:08:46.418
ALSO. AND AGAIN THE SOME OF

02:08:46.485 --> 02:08:47.619
THIS HAS TO DO THE FEDS TO WHAT

02:08:47.686 --> 02:08:49.455
THE ALLOWS TO DO BUT BUT I MEAN

02:08:49.521 --> 02:08:50.722
IN TERMS OF THE ELDER VIED

02:08:50.789 --> 02:08:52.057
LEAST BEFORE WE ROLL IT OUT

02:08:52.124 --> 02:08:53.525
SOME BUFFERS TO TAKE CARE OF

02:08:53.592 --> 02:08:55.127
LEGITIMATE ISSUES WHERE PEOPLE

02:08:55.194 --> 02:08:56.862
MIGHT HAVE. BUILT THE THERE'S A

02:08:56.929 --> 02:08:58.230
MISCALCULATION ARE PART THEIR

02:08:58.297 --> 02:09:01.266
POWER OR SOMEWHERE ELSE AND

02:09:01.333 --> 02:09:04.803
THAT. WITH THAT- BASICALLY WE

02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:06.138
WANT ANYONE RUNNING SHORT OF

02:09:06.205 --> 02:09:07.840
MONEY MIDWAY THROUGH THE YEAR-

02:09:07.906 --> 02:09:09.374
AND TRYING TO VOTE NEW SERVICES

02:09:09.441 --> 02:09:10.742
THAT THEY TURNED OUT THAT THEY

02:09:10.809 --> 02:09:11.643
FIND CELLS UNABLE TO ACTUALLY

02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:14.012
PAY FOR. SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO

02:09:14.079 --> 02:09:17.683
TRY TO BUFFER AGAINST A- I WAS

02:09:17.749 --> 02:09:18.851
A MISCALCULATION NOW COULD BE

02:09:18.917 --> 02:09:20.085
ON THE OTHER END WE MIGHT FIND

02:09:20.152 --> 02:09:21.520
WAYS TO DRAW MONEY BACK BUT-

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:23.288
LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THE FIRST

02:09:23.355 --> 02:09:26.125
PROBLEM- SO- ALL KIND OF SET.

02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:27.860
UP TO. INTO TWO DIFFERENT

02:09:27.926 --> 02:09:29.328
BUCKETS THEN HAS TO MENTION IN

02:09:29.394 --> 02:09:30.362
LIEU OF SERVICES. TO THE

02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:31.597
DEPARTMENT DOES PLAN ON

02:09:31.663 --> 02:09:33.532
LEVERAGING OUR EXPERIENCE WITH

02:09:33.599 --> 02:09:35.300
HEALTH HOMES IN REGARDS TO SOME

02:09:35.367 --> 02:09:36.535
OF THE ASSUMPTIONS FOR

02:09:36.602 --> 02:09:38.403
REBUILDING. BECAUSE IT WAS A

02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:41.006
HIGH TOUCH- HIGHER UTILIZING

02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:42.374
POPULATION IN REGARDS TO THAT

02:09:42.441 --> 02:09:43.809
IT DID HAVE SOME OF THE HOUSING

02:09:43.876 --> 02:09:44.843
COMPONENT THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:46.411
ABOUT. TO DO PLAN ON LEVERAGING

02:09:46.478 --> 02:09:47.412
UP BUT IT WILL BE DIFFERENT

02:09:47.479 --> 02:09:48.714
BECAUSE HEALTH HOMES WAS PAID

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:50.215
ON A SUPPLEMENTAL. BASED ON

02:09:50.282 --> 02:09:52.217
UTILIZATION HERE WE PLAN ON

02:09:52.284 --> 02:09:53.552
BUILDING THIS INTO THE MANAGED

02:09:53.619 --> 02:09:55.320
CARE PLAN RATE AS A SEPARATE

02:09:55.387 --> 02:09:56.855
CATEGORY OF SERVICE SO THAT WE

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:58.857
CAN MONITOR IT. ESPECIALLY AS

02:09:58.924 --> 02:10:00.025
WE ROLL IT OUT TO MAKE SURE

02:10:00.092 --> 02:10:02.060
WERE SEEN TO EITHER. UNDER OR

02:10:02.127 --> 02:10:03.795
OR MORE UTILIZATION DEPENDING

02:10:03.862 --> 02:10:05.297
ON WHAT WE SEE THERE. ON IS

02:10:05.364 --> 02:10:06.398
GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO

02:10:06.465 --> 02:10:08.767
US- IT WILL BE LOSS OF THE

02:10:08.834 --> 02:10:09.801
BUILDING OTHER SECTIONS BECAUSE

02:10:09.868 --> 02:10:11.737
WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY ASSUMING

02:10:11.803 --> 02:10:12.671
IN THESE. THESE NUMBERS ARE

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:14.873
BEING. KIND OF CHANGE THE DAR

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:15.908
RATE THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS.

02:10:15.974 --> 02:10:16.942
ACTIVELY WORKING ON A READ

02:10:17.009 --> 02:10:18.377
ABOUT SO THAT'S ONE CABBIE OUT

02:10:18.443 --> 02:10:19.978
THERE IS THAT WE'RE STILL VERY

02:10:20.045 --> 02:10:21.046
MUCH LOOKING AT. HOW ARE WE

02:10:21.113 --> 02:10:22.414
GOING TO BUILD THIS IN. BUT IT

02:10:22.481 --> 02:10:24.216
WOULD BE A CENTURY READ SAY

02:10:24.283 --> 02:10:25.951
ACROSS THE ENTIRE MEDI CAL

02:10:26.018 --> 02:10:29.721
pOVERSEE. ABOUT 1% OF THOSE

02:10:29.788 --> 02:10:30.789
INDIVIDUALS WOULD PROBABLY END

02:10:30.856 --> 02:10:32.291
UP GETTING THIS HIGHER LEVEL

02:10:32.357 --> 02:10:33.992
TOUCH ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT

02:10:34.059 --> 02:10:37.262
BECAUSE IT IS MORE THAN JUST.

02:10:37.329 --> 02:10:37.996
OUR STATE WE ACTUALLY. THE

02:10:38.063 --> 02:10:40.232
SERVICE BUT THEY WOULD ALSO PAY

02:10:40.299 --> 02:10:42.067
FOR MAYBE UP TO THREE OR 5%

02:10:42.134 --> 02:10:43.135
WERE YOU DOING OUT REGION

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:44.136
ENGAGEMENT TO THEM BECAUSE

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:45.637
THESE TYPES OF POPULATIONS ARE

02:10:45.704 --> 02:10:47.472
USUALLY PRETTY COMPLEX. ON THE

02:10:47.539 --> 02:10:47.973
FIRST TIME YOU ENCOUNTER

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:49.408
SOMEONE WHO'S HOMELESS. THEY

02:10:49.474 --> 02:10:50.709
DON'T JUST AUTOMATICALLY SAY

02:10:50.776 --> 02:10:51.977
YES I WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN

02:10:52.044 --> 02:10:53.111
YOUR ENHANCE MERIT YOU KNOW

02:10:53.178 --> 02:10:54.413
CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OR GET

02:10:54.479 --> 02:10:55.981
ME AND HOUSING. IT'S AN

02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:57.883
ENGAGEMENT PROCESS OVER TIME

02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:59.451
AND SOMETIMES A VERY LONG. TIME

02:10:59.518 --> 02:11:00.719
SAME IF YOU'RE ENGAGING WITH

02:11:00.786 --> 02:11:01.787
SOMEONE WHO IS IN A SKILLED

02:11:01.853 --> 02:11:02.988
NURSING FACILITY WANTED TO

02:11:03.055 --> 02:11:04.056
TRANSITION TO THE HOME OUR

02:11:04.122 --> 02:11:05.657
COMMUNITY. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN

02:11:05.724 --> 02:11:06.525
JUST THE FIRST TIME YOU DO OUT

02:11:06.592 --> 02:11:07.492
REACH. SO WE WOULD BE

02:11:07.559 --> 02:11:08.827
ESSENTIALLY BUILDING IN SOME

02:11:08.894 --> 02:11:10.329
OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT

02:11:10.395 --> 02:11:12.264
PORTIONS. AND THEN OF THOSE

02:11:12.331 --> 02:11:13.198
THAT YOU OUT REACHING AGENT

02:11:13.265 --> 02:11:14.366
WHAT PORTION OF THOSE WILL

02:11:14.433 --> 02:11:15.667
ACTUALLY RECEIVE ENHANCE CARE

02:11:15.734 --> 02:11:18.270
MANAGEMENT SERVICES. SO THAT'S

02:11:18.337 --> 02:11:19.204
HOW WE ARE LOOKING AT THE

02:11:19.271 --> 02:11:19.705
ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT

02:11:19.771 --> 02:11:21.607
PORTION. WE WOULD BE BUILT IN.

02:11:21.673 --> 02:11:23.008
ACROSS THE RATE PROBABLY HAD A

02:11:23.075 --> 02:11:24.109
PERCENTAGE IN THAT. PERCENT MAY

02:11:24.176 --> 02:11:25.777
VARY DEPENDING ON THE- THE

02:11:25.844 --> 02:11:28.046
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IN IN THE

02:11:28.113 --> 02:11:29.314
POPULATIONS THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:32.317
ABOUT- BUT THAT'S APPARENTLY.

02:11:32.384 --> 02:11:33.885
WERE THINKING ON THE ENHANCE

02:11:33.952 --> 02:11:35.120
YOUR MNAGEMENT. FOR IN LIEU OF

02:11:35.187 --> 02:11:36.888
SERVER IS. A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

02:11:36.955 --> 02:11:38.490
ON AS ANY OTHER THING I WOULD

02:11:38.557 --> 02:11:39.691
SAY IS SINCE ENHANCE YOUR

02:11:39.758 --> 02:11:41.093
MANAGEMENT IS DIFFERENT

02:11:41.159 --> 02:11:42.427
STATEWIDE SO WE HAVE. A WHOLE

02:11:42.494 --> 02:11:44.229
PERSON CARE- IN CERTAIN

02:11:44.296 --> 02:11:45.797
COUNTIES AND WE HAVE HELP HOMES

02:11:45.864 --> 02:11:46.832
IN CERTAIN COUNTIES AND THEN WE

02:11:46.898 --> 02:11:47.933
HAVE CERTAIN COUNTIES WITH

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.269
WITH. NEITHER AND SO WE WILL BE

02:11:50.335 --> 02:11:52.337
FACTORING THOSE KIND OF- RAMP

02:11:52.404 --> 02:11:53.338
UP TIME PERIODS WITHIN THE

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:55.107
RATES APPROPRIATELY WHERE WE

02:11:55.173 --> 02:11:56.074
ALREADY HAVE WHOLE PERSON CARE

02:11:56.141 --> 02:11:57.509
AND HEALTH HOMES OR BOTH AND

02:11:57.576 --> 02:11:59.111
COUNTY. THEY WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE

02:11:59.177 --> 02:12:01.613
MORE TO ADD MEDIA- GO LIVE ON

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:03.448
JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE-

02:12:03.515 --> 02:12:05.017
INSTEAD OF A PLANNED THIS KIND

02:12:05.083 --> 02:12:06.752
OF RAMPING. UP THOSE TYPES OF

02:12:06.818 --> 02:12:09.655
FACTORS WILL BE BUILT INTO THE

02:12:09.721 --> 02:12:12.491
ASSUMPTIONS. OF THE PENDING ON

02:12:12.557 --> 02:12:13.058
WHAT TYPE OF COUNTY.THAT YOU

02:12:13.125 --> 02:12:16.995
ARE ALSO PROPOSED EIGHT. I CAN

02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:18.330
TO. IMPLEMENTATION SO ANYONE

02:12:18.397 --> 02:12:19.197
WITH A WHOLE PERSON CARE HEALTH

02:12:19.264 --> 02:12:25.470
COMES WOULD GO LAW. WE WANT. TO

02:12:25.537 --> 02:12:27.205
TWENTY. AND THEN. PUT OUT THAT

02:12:27.272 --> 02:12:27.839
WOULD GO LIVE LIVE ON TWENTY

02:12:27.906 --> 02:12:28.440
TWENTY TO ALLOW FOR THE- ONE

02:12:28.507 --> 02:12:29.107
MORE TIME FOR THEM TO BE. THEIR

02:12:29.174 --> 02:12:30.442
TO CONTRACT PROVIDER IS REALLY

02:12:30.509 --> 02:12:32.044
IMPORTANT KEY- BUT IT ALSO

02:12:32.110 --> 02:12:33.679
ALLOWS US TO. TO KIND OF THINK

02:12:33.745 --> 02:12:35.280
OF THE ASSUMPTIONS OF THAT RATE

02:12:35.347 --> 02:12:36.515
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AS

02:12:36.581 --> 02:12:38.383
WELL. FOR IN LIEU OF SERVICES

02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:39.518
SINCE IT IS TECHNICALLY IN LIEU

02:12:39.584 --> 02:12:41.753
OF SOMETHING MORE EXPENSIVE- WE

02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:43.355
ARE NOT MAKING REDUCTIONS TO

02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:45.390
THE IN PATIENT- ER STAYS. ON

02:12:45.457 --> 02:12:46.892
BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY THAT'S WHAT

02:12:46.958 --> 02:12:47.759
YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE IN LIEU

02:12:47.826 --> 02:12:49.194
OF SERVICES IN LIEU OF THOSE

02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:51.263
HIGH COST SERVICES- BUT AS YOU

02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:52.431
SAW ON THE BUDGET THERE IS.

02:12:52.497 --> 02:12:54.499
THERE IS MONEY SCORED TO-

02:12:54.566 --> 02:12:56.368
INCLUDE INTO THE IT THE PLANS

02:12:56.435 --> 02:12:58.403
RATES FOR IN THE WEB SERVICES.

02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:59.571
AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE HAVE

02:12:59.638 --> 02:13:01.573
SEEN- IN OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.075
PLAYED IT LOTS RECOUP OF CARE

02:13:03.141 --> 02:13:04.910
BEDS GO UP- THROUGH A WHOLE

02:13:04.976 --> 02:13:06.578
PERSON CARE. I'M SOBERING

02:13:06.645 --> 02:13:08.146
CENTERS HAVE COME UP- WE DO

02:13:08.213 --> 02:13:10.248
KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR CCI PLANS

02:13:10.315 --> 02:13:13.185
PROVIDE- WRAPAROUND SERVICES

02:13:13.251 --> 02:13:13.785
FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THAT

02:13:13.852 --> 02:13:15.854
PROGRAM. AND SO WE WILL USE

02:13:15.921 --> 02:13:17.956
SOME UTILIZATION TO BUILD INTO

02:13:18.023 --> 02:13:19.591
THE RIGHT INITIALLY- AND THEN

02:13:19.658 --> 02:13:20.859
ONCE THEY START BUILDING

02:13:20.926 --> 02:13:22.194
UTILIZATION STATEWIDE THAT IT

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:23.829
WOULD EVENTUALLY BE CONTINUE TO

02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:24.663
BE BUILT INTO THE RATE MOVING

02:13:24.730 --> 02:13:26.298
FORWARD SO IT'S KIND OF. SOME

02:13:26.365 --> 02:13:27.899
UP FRONT WHERE WE DO SEE IT

02:13:27.966 --> 02:13:28.867
CERTAIN COUNTIES WHO HAVE TWO

02:13:28.934 --> 02:13:30.469
WHOLE PERSON CARE. WHERE WE

02:13:30.535 --> 02:13:31.703
HAVE ALL THE ENCOUNTER DATA ON

02:13:31.770 --> 02:13:33.171
THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO BUILD IN

02:13:33.238 --> 02:13:36.541
UP FRONT- AND THEN OVER TIME IS

02:13:36.608 --> 02:13:38.176
PLANS BUILT THE IN IEU OF

02:13:38.243 --> 02:13:38.744
SERVICES WE WOULD BUILD THAT

02:13:38.810 --> 02:13:39.644
AND FACTORED. INTO THEIR

02:13:39.711 --> 02:13:41.380
REGULAR RATE DEVELOPMENT

02:13:41.446 --> 02:13:42.013
THROUGH THAT BREAK DEVELOPMENT

02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:45.517
PROCESS- THE ONE THING I WOULD-

02:13:45.584 --> 02:13:48.253
ALSO. OF FLAG WHEN IT COMES TO

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:51.189
THAT IS WE WILL- PLANS IT'S AN

02:13:51.256 --> 02:13:52.324
OPTIONAL BENEFITS SO THEY WOULD

02:13:52.391 --> 02:13:53.458
BE TELLING US IN ADVANCE. THEY

02:13:53.525 --> 02:13:55.293
ARE OR NOT PROVIDING THE INTO

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:56.862
OF SERVICES. ON IT SOMETHING

02:13:56.928 --> 02:13:59.664
THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE AWARE OF

02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:01.700
AND THEN WE WOULD FACTOR THAT

02:14:01.767 --> 02:14:03.201
IN IN THE FUTURE AS IT STARTING

02:14:03.268 --> 02:14:09.274
TO. RAMP UP THOSE SERVICES. YES

02:14:09.341 --> 02:14:11.376
EIGHT APRIL THAT WHAT YOU'RE

02:14:11.443 --> 02:14:12.844
TRY TO DO IN THE AGENTS TRIED

02:14:12.911 --> 02:14:15.847
TO I GUESS MY CAUTION IS THAT-

02:14:15.914 --> 02:14:17.749
THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS

02:14:17.816 --> 02:14:19.951
SO WHAT BECAUSE WE HAVE AND THE

02:14:20.018 --> 02:14:21.720
PEN AND WE'RE ALL REST THE

02:14:21.787 --> 02:14:23.422
WE'RE ALL EXPECTING THE PLAN TO

02:14:23.488 --> 02:14:24.589
DO SO SEVEN I KNOW THAT YOU'RE

02:14:24.656 --> 02:14:25.757
YOU KNOW MAYBE WITH SOME PEOPLE

02:14:25.824 --> 02:14:27.058
MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THESE WITH

02:14:27.125 --> 02:14:28.326
EXISTING PROGRAM THAT'S

02:14:28.393 --> 02:14:29.628
RELATIVE SO WE CAN TRY TO GET

02:14:29.694 --> 02:14:31.596
SAID SERRA SO. BUT YOU KNOW YOU

02:14:31.663 --> 02:14:33.598
GOT WE GOT IN OF THE ENHANCED

02:14:33.665 --> 02:14:35.233
CHAIR MANAGEMENT WE GET THE IN

02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:36.968
LIEU SERVICES WE'RE GONNA BE

02:14:37.035 --> 02:14:38.236
FINANCIALLY FOLDING IN THE LONG

02:14:38.303 --> 02:14:41.773
TERM CARE WHICH SOME PLANS MAY

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:44.309
NOT HAVE AND SO AND- THEN

02:14:44.376 --> 02:14:47.212
MORAGA NEGOTIATOR RATE FOR

02:14:47.279 --> 02:14:49.181
THESE DIFFERENT PIECES RIGHT

02:14:49.247 --> 02:14:50.615
AND SO SOMEBODY IN THE BACK

02:14:50.682 --> 02:14:52.818
OFFICE AT THE PLAN IS GOING TO

02:14:52.884 --> 02:14:53.652
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THAT

02:14:53.718 --> 02:14:56.154
COSTS SO THEY CAN NEGOTIATE.

02:14:56.221 --> 02:14:57.122
SIDE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR

02:14:57.189 --> 02:15:00.959
PEOPLE THAT OUT AND SAID THIS

02:15:01.026 --> 02:15:01.626
IS WHAT WE THINK IT'S KIND OF A-

02:15:01.693 --> 02:15:03.228
AND IT'S POSSIBLE. EITHER AND I

02:15:03.295 --> 02:15:05.197
GUESS IT'S ON THE STATE BECAUSE

02:15:05.263 --> 02:15:06.865
IT BUT IT'S POSSIBLE SOMEONE

02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:08.600
GUESSED WRONG. RIGHT RIGHT A

02:15:08.667 --> 02:15:11.236
DAVID DOWSON SOMETHING HAPPENS

02:15:11.303 --> 02:15:13.338
THAT WE DIDN'T EXPECT RIGHT- SO

02:15:13.405 --> 02:15:16.975
FOR EXAMPLE- IT. YOU KNOW MAYBE

02:15:17.042 --> 02:15:19.177
THERE'S A BACKLOG OF PEOPLE WHO

02:15:19.244 --> 02:15:21.613
NEED NURSING HOME CARE THAT

02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:23.181
WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT NOW THAT

02:15:23.248 --> 02:15:25.383
WE KNOW FULL THEN WE GOT SOME

02:15:25.450 --> 02:15:26.852
IN LIEU WE GOT SOME PEOPLE OUT

02:15:26.918 --> 02:15:28.453
BUT THEN IT CELLS AND CENTER

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:30.121
AND SO TURNS OUT THE RATE.

02:15:30.188 --> 02:15:31.623
BECAUSE THERE IS A SERVICE THE

02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:33.024
MAN THAT YOU COULDN'T SEE

02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:34.192
BECAUSE THIS IS WASN'T ANY

02:15:34.259 --> 02:15:36.595
FACILITY AVAILABLE NOW SO HAS

02:15:36.661 --> 02:15:38.196
HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY SCOTT SAVE

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:39.397
MONEY WHAT HAPPENED WAS IS THAT

02:15:39.464 --> 02:15:40.232
YOU ACTUALLY TOOK CARE OF MORE

02:15:40.298 --> 02:15:41.600
PEOPLE. BECAUSE THERE'S A

02:15:41.666 --> 02:15:42.801
BACKLOG OR SOMETHING IT SO I

02:15:42.868 --> 02:15:44.536
JUST SOME SO CIRCUMSTANCE SO

02:15:44.603 --> 02:15:46.938
WITH THE UNION EXAMPLE WHERE.

02:15:47.005 --> 02:15:48.607
SOME THAT SHOULD WORK. BECAUSE

02:15:48.673 --> 02:15:50.976
OF THE SAID SITUATION SO- I

02:15:51.042 --> 02:15:52.878
UNDERSTAND THAT WAY BACK WHEN

02:15:52.944 --> 02:15:54.412
WE TRIED IN ENHANCE PRIMARY

02:15:54.479 --> 02:15:55.947
CARE PAYMENT FOR PRANK YOUR

02:15:56.014 --> 02:15:57.115
DOCTORS TO BETTER COORDINATE

02:15:57.182 --> 02:15:58.316
CARES A MODEL THOSE VERY

02:15:58.383 --> 02:15:59.451
SUCCESSFULLY USED IN SOME

02:15:59.518 --> 02:16:01.152
STATES LIKE NORTH CAROLINA. BUT

02:16:01.219 --> 02:16:02.387
APPARENTLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:16:02.454 --> 02:16:04.389
DIDN'T WORK SO WELL. AND I

02:16:04.456 --> 02:16:05.924
UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THE

02:16:05.991 --> 02:16:07.359
REASON IT WORKS SO WELL IS

02:16:07.425 --> 02:16:07.993
BECAUSE OUR MEDI CAL PAYMENTS

02:16:08.059 --> 02:16:09.394
WHICH ARE ONE AMONG THE LOWEST

02:16:09.461 --> 02:16:10.128
IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY ARE SO

02:16:10.195 --> 02:16:11.963
LOW. THAT INSTEAD OF PEOPLE

02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:13.265
TAKING ENHANCE PAYMENT AND

02:16:13.331 --> 02:16:14.733
DOING AS MUCH CORONATION CARED

02:16:14.799 --> 02:16:16.201
THEY KIND OF TRY TO USE THAT TO

02:16:16.268 --> 02:16:17.269
KEEP THE PRACTICE IS GOING

02:16:17.335 --> 02:16:19.738
BECAUSE- THE- FEDERAL BUMP UP

02:16:19.804 --> 02:16:20.539
RIGHT. AND SO YOU DIDN'T

02:16:20.605 --> 02:16:21.673
ACTUALLY GET THE CHANGE OF

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.675
BEHAVIOR THAT HAPPENED WHICH BY

02:16:23.742 --> 02:16:24.142
THE WAY ALSO TAKES AN

02:16:24.209 --> 02:16:25.810
INVESTMENT SO WE WANT PEOPLE TO

02:16:25.877 --> 02:16:27.012
DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. IN THE

02:16:27.078 --> 02:16:28.146
VERY BEGINNING THAT MAKES ME

02:16:28.213 --> 02:16:29.581
TAKE A LITTLE MORE MONEY BEFORE

02:16:29.648 --> 02:16:30.882
THEY FINALLY SWITCH OVER RIGHT

02:16:30.949 --> 02:16:32.617
SO YOU KNOW THE HOUSE. NOW THAT

02:16:32.684 --> 02:16:33.718
WE CAN DO THE IN LIEU OF IT'S

02:16:33.785 --> 02:16:34.719
NOT JUST LIKE SWAPPING

02:16:34.786 --> 02:16:35.987
SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO. THINK

02:16:36.054 --> 02:16:36.955
COULD ORGANIZE THINGS

02:16:37.022 --> 02:16:39.891
DIFFERENTLY AND SO I GUESS THE

02:16:39.958 --> 02:16:41.726
QUESTION I WOULD PUT AND AGAIN

02:16:41.793 --> 02:16:42.661
I'M VERY SUPPORT OF WHAT YOU'RE

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:45.630
TRYING TO DO- IS TO SAY IS

02:16:45.697 --> 02:16:48.366
THAT- I WANT TO BE CAREFUL THAT

02:16:48.433 --> 02:16:49.834
HOW WE DEFINE WHAT'S GOING TO

02:16:49.901 --> 02:16:51.436
HAPPEN THE FIRST FEW YEARS IN

02:16:51.503 --> 02:16:52.871
THE FIRST YEARS A TRANSITION.

02:16:52.938 --> 02:16:53.772
THAT WE SET THE RIGHT

02:16:53.838 --> 02:16:55.473
EXPECTATION SO LET ME GIVE YOU

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:56.908
ANOTHER EXAMPLE WITH THE ACA.

02:16:56.975 --> 02:16:58.076
OF PEOPLE THAT WILL GET MORE

02:16:58.143 --> 02:16:59.411
PEOPLE INSURANCE WHICH IS C. E.

02:16:59.477 --> 02:17:04.149
R. USE GO DOWN I SAID NO NO.

02:17:04.215 --> 02:17:04.716
ACTUALLY HERE IS WILL GO UP

02:17:04.783 --> 02:17:06.084
FIRST WHY WHY WHY IS THAT. WE

02:17:06.151 --> 02:17:07.519
pPROPER CARETO. IS THAT WHAT

02:17:07.586 --> 02:17:08.853
THE PROBLEM IS THAT. IF YOU

02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:10.889
WEREN'T INSURED BEFORE. THAT'S

02:17:10.956 --> 02:17:12.190
WHERE YOU NORMALLY GO YOU DON'T

02:17:12.257 --> 02:17:13.358
HAVE A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR USE

02:17:13.425 --> 02:17:14.926
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M SURE CW SO

02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:16.394
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT NOW WHEN

02:17:16.461 --> 02:17:17.028
YOU GOT SICK NAY OF INSURANCE

02:17:17.095 --> 02:17:18.697
CARD. HE GOT SICK OKAY WELL

02:17:18.763 --> 02:17:21.399
WHAT DO I GO. I DO WHAT MY

02:17:21.466 --> 02:17:22.033
USUAL THING IS WHAT WE ACTUALLY

02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:23.101
HAVE TO DO IS INVEST. SOME

02:17:23.168 --> 02:17:25.103
MONEY IN. TEACHING PEOPLE IN RE

02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:26.204
DIRECTING THE SHOW FOR THE E.

02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:27.305
R. WELL. HERE'S YOUR PRIMARY

02:17:27.372 --> 02:17:28.273
CARE DOCTOR YOU SHOULD GO HERE

02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:29.841
FIRST NEXT TIME ETCETERA TAKE

02:17:29.908 --> 02:17:31.042
SOME TIME FOR PEOPLE AND IS

02:17:31.109 --> 02:17:32.611
ALSO BY WE A BACKLOG OF. ON

02:17:32.677 --> 02:17:34.179
THAT HEALTH NEEDS THAT THEY HAD

02:17:34.245 --> 02:17:35.280
RIGHT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T SURE

02:17:35.347 --> 02:17:36.748
DATE. THE LATE GETTING CARE. SO

02:17:36.815 --> 02:17:38.550
NOW YOU HAVE TO. BUMP UP IN

02:17:38.617 --> 02:17:40.485
UTILIZATION. AND YOU GO OH WOW

02:17:40.552 --> 02:17:41.820
YOU NOW TO FAILURE WE GOT

02:17:41.886 --> 02:17:42.954
PEOPLE MORE COVERAGE IS

02:17:43.021 --> 02:17:43.788
SUPPOSED TO DECREASE YOUR

02:17:43.855 --> 02:17:45.357
STATION THE THEY CHRISSY ARGUES

02:17:45.423 --> 02:17:47.058
INSIDE RIGHT NOW I WENT UP. IS

02:17:47.125 --> 02:17:48.259
IT WELL THAT'S A TRANSITION

02:17:48.326 --> 02:17:49.761
PERIOD BECAUSE THAT'S YOU KNOW

02:17:49.828 --> 02:17:51.096
WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE BACKLOG

02:17:51.162 --> 02:17:51.663
THEN WE'LL GET TO THE RIGHT

02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:54.399
PLACE. SO I JUST WANT TO BE

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:56.134
CAREFUL HOW WE DO THIS WE DON'T

02:17:56.201 --> 02:17:58.603
TO CREATE SITUATIONS WHERE. YOU

02:17:58.670 --> 02:18:00.472
KNOW AND FIGURE OUT AND AGAIN I

02:18:00.538 --> 02:18:01.606
REALIZE SOME OF THIS BECAUSE IT

02:18:01.673 --> 02:18:02.474
WORKED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOW

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:04.309
THE WAIVERS IT CETERA. HOW WE

02:18:04.376 --> 02:18:06.544
PUT IN SOME BUFFERS THERE TO

02:18:06.611 --> 02:18:11.449
TAKE. CITY. TO BASICALLY DEAL

02:18:11.516 --> 02:18:12.484
WITH. YOU KNOW THE THINGS WE

02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:13.518
DON'T TO. WE'D AS HARD RECANTED.

02:18:13.585 --> 02:18:14.519
EVERYTHING BUT WE LL KNOW WE

02:18:14.586 --> 02:18:15.720
CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE AND E

02:18:15.787 --> 02:18:17.322
DO KNOW THAT OF. ESPECIALLY

02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:18.023
COMPLEX SYSTEMS OF YOUR

02:18:18.089 --> 02:18:19.758
EXPECTING PLANS. TO HAVE TO

02:18:19.824 --> 02:18:21.226
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RISK IS. TO

02:18:21.292 --> 02:18:22.794
DO. FULL AND HEALTH CARE

02:18:22.861 --> 02:18:23.695
MANAGEMENT AND THEN THEY'RE

02:18:23.762 --> 02:18:24.796
ALSO GOING TO DO SOME AND LOSE

02:18:24.863 --> 02:18:27.365
SERVICES AND THEN OUR AGO ALSO

02:18:27.432 --> 02:18:27.966
TO INCLUDE YOUR FULL THEN THE

02:18:28.033 --> 02:18:29.534
LONG TERM CARE. WELL YOU WE

02:18:29.601 --> 02:18:31.002
JUST THREW IN THREE VERY BIG

02:18:31.069 --> 02:18:32.303
MOVING PARTS EVENTUALLY ALL

02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:34.506
SORTED OUT. DEL FIGURE OUT WHAT

02:18:34.572 --> 02:18:35.440
THE RATE SHOULD BE YOU'LL

02:18:35.507 --> 02:18:36.908
FIGURE IT CETERA WILL. GET

02:18:36.975 --> 02:18:38.943
ACTUAL SOME REAL EXPERIENCE IN

02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:39.577
ANIMALS OR SETTLE DOWN WHAT IT

02:18:39.644 --> 02:18:41.346
REALLY SHOULD BE. BUT UNTIL

02:18:41.413 --> 02:18:43.014
THEN. SOMEBODY'S GONNA GUESS

02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:44.616
TOO HIGH TO LOW IT CETERA. ON

02:18:44.683 --> 02:18:46.051
BOTH SIDES AND THEN WE MAY HAVE

02:18:46.117 --> 02:18:47.352
SITUATIONS WHERE MIGHT NEED TO.

02:18:47.419 --> 02:18:49.320
BE ABLE TO. TO SO THAT. ANY

02:18:49.387 --> 02:18:51.289
FISHERIES DON'T GET CAUGHT. IN

02:18:51.356 --> 02:18:54.526
THAT SITUATION SO. I JUST. YEAH

02:18:54.592 --> 02:18:56.327
I DESERVE. PUT THAT OUT THERE

02:18:56.394 --> 02:18:57.762
SERVERS THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE

02:18:57.829 --> 02:18:59.597
CAN DO. AS WERE ROLLING THROUGH

02:18:59.664 --> 02:19:00.699
EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING REALLY

02:19:00.765 --> 02:19:03.902
pPOSSIBLE ESTIMATES AND SO

02:19:03.968 --> 02:19:05.537
FORTH. THAT WE- GIVE OURSELVES

02:19:05.603 --> 02:19:07.972
SOME WIGGLE ROOM IF WE CAN. TO

IT MAY BE A IS A REALLY

02:21:11.196 --> 02:21:12.897
CRITICAL PART OF THE PROPOSAL

FOR TO SEE SUCCESS WE ACTUALLY

02:21:14.065 --> 02:21:15.300

02:21:22.307 --> 02:21:26.077
CAPACITY. FIRST AND WE KNOW IT

02:21:26.144 --> 02:21:26.644
WILL TAKE TIME SO WE NEED WE

02:21:26.711 --> 02:21:28.046
DON'T. THIS YOU KNOW FALL

02:21:28.112 --> 02:21:29.414
INTERPRET. THAT ON JANUARY

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:30.014
TWENTY TWO ONE WE'RE GOING TO

INCENTIVES TO DRIVE TOWARDS

02:21:36.454 --> 02:21:37.522
WHAT'S NECESSARY AND WHAT'S

02:21:37.589 --> 02:21:39.924
NEEDED- AND THEN REALLY CV IN

02:21:39.991 --> 02:21:41.492
LIEU OF SERVICES BUILT. OVER A

02:21:41.559 --> 02:21:43.194
FIVE YEAR PERIOD. PLANS ARE

GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THEM ALL

02:21:44.195 --> 02:21:46.497
DAY ONE WE KNOW THAT- BUT- AS

02:21:46.564 --> 02:21:48.433
THE BILL CAPACITY TO BUILD THAT

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:50.134
STATEWIDE- WE'RE REALLY HOPING

02:21:50.201 --> 02:21:51.803
IT CAN FILL IN GAPS OVER A LONG

02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:53.438
PERIOD OF TIME. YEAH I WOULD

02:21:53.504 --> 02:21:54.572

INITIAL M. C. E. RATES WHEN ACA

02:22:04.582 --> 02:22:07.752
HAPPENED. RIGHT RIGHT OUT. SO I

02:22:07.819 --> 02:22:09.120
THINK THE NUMBER ONE THE

02:22:09.187 --> 02:22:10.154

SPD'S. MISCALCULATION MIGHT BE

02:22:23.534 --> 02:22:25.803
A TERM THAT CAN BE USED- SO I

02:22:25.870 --> 02:22:26.771
THINK THERE'S MORE

02:22:26.838 --> 02:22:28.273
SOPHISTICATION. THERE IS SOME

02:22:28.339 --> 02:22:29.941

GONE ON IN COUNTIES AND WE'RE

02:25:50.975 --> 02:25:53.644

PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. THE

02:26:09.127 --> 02:26:11.329

PAYMENTS THAT WE THAT WE DO

02:26:48.566 --> 02:26:49.567
REASON FOR PERIL IS THE

SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION.

02:35:41.799 --> 02:35:42.933
FIRST STRONG LOCAL

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:44.435
RELATIONSHIPS SECOND BUILDING

INFRASTRUCTURE. THIRD

02:35:47.137 --> 02:35:48.639
MAXIMIZING INCENTIVES AND THEN

02:35:52.543 --> 02:35:53.744
BELIEVETHAT RELATIONSHIPS ARE

02:35:53.811 --> 02:35:55.112
THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCCESS

02:35:55.179 --> 02:35:56.847
HERE. SHORTLY AFTER THE COUNTY

02:35:56.914 --> 02:35:58.682
PROPOSAL WAS RELEASED- IN THE

02:35:58.749 --> 02:36:00.417
FALL LOCAL PLAN STARTED HAVING

02:36:00.484 --> 02:36:01.118
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR

02:36:01.185 --> 02:36:03.487
COUNTIES. WE RECOGNIZE THE

02:36:03.554 --> 02:36:04.421
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING

02:36:04.488 --> 02:36:05.856
CONVERSATIONS EARLY AND OFTEN

02:36:05.923 --> 02:36:07.257
AND THINK THAT THIS WILL SET US

02:36:07.324 --> 02:36:09.560
UP FOR SUCCESSFUL- PLANNING

02:36:09.626 --> 02:36:10.661

LIEU OF SERVICES. SECOND

02:36:14.131 --> 02:36:15.766
BUILDING FROM EXIST IN EXISTING

02:36:15.833 --> 02:36:17.968
SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. SO

02:36:18.035 --> 02:36:19.403
AS WE'VE HEARD EACH PLAN WILL

02:36:19.470 --> 02:36:20.771
HAVE A DIFFERENT STARTING POINT

02:36:20.838 --> 02:36:22.272
BASED ON THE PROGRAMS AND

02:36:22.339 --> 02:36:23.707
SERVICES AND- EXIST IN THEIR

02:36:23.774 --> 02:36:25.542

02:36:25.609 --> 02:36:27.444
COMMONALITIES THAT ALL PLANS.

02:36:27.511 --> 02:36:28.345
REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE

02:36:28.412 --> 02:36:29.379
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN

02:36:29.446 --> 02:36:30.547
DEVELOPED THROUGH WHOLE PERSON

02:36:30.614 --> 02:36:32.082
KAREN HEALTH HOMES. WILL BE

02:36:32.149 --> 02:36:35.085
CRITICAL FOR BRINGING THOSE

02:36:35.152 --> 02:36:35.652
PROVIDERS INTO THEIR NETWORK

02:36:35.719 --> 02:36:36.286
THROUGH SUCCESS OF THESE. AND

02:36:36.353 --> 02:36:37.254
IN LIEU OF SERVICES.

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:39.156
ADDITIONALLY IT LOCAL PLANS DO

02:36:39.223 --> 02:36:40.090
YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE IN

02:36:40.157 --> 02:36:41.391

02:36:41.458 --> 02:36:43.694
SERVICES TODAY. I'M FOR EXAMPLE

02:36:43.761 --> 02:36:44.795
KERN HEALTH SYSTEMS TO YOU

02:36:44.862 --> 02:36:45.863
HEARD FROM EARLIER THIS

02:36:45.929 --> 02:36:47.297
AFTERNOON HAS BEEN FUNDING

02:36:47.364 --> 02:36:49.133
MEDICAL RESPITE BEDS. IN THEIR

02:36:49.199 --> 02:36:50.434
COMMUNITIES TO FOR HOMELESS

02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:51.668
BENEFICIARIES TRANSITIONING

02:36:51.735 --> 02:36:53.370
FROM INPATIENT SETTINGS. SO WE

02:36:53.437 --> 02:36:54.872
THINK THAT IT'S THESE TYPE OF

02:36:54.938 --> 02:36:55.906
INVESTMENTS THAT WILL REALLY

02:36:55.973 --> 02:36:57.574
LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR ULTIMATE

02:37:01.178 --> 02:37:02.780

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR-

02:37:09.219 --> 02:37:10.053
AND WE THINK THAT'LL BE

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:11.488
CRITICAL FOR BUILDING OUT THE

02:37:11.555 --> 02:37:12.589
COMMUNITY BASED A LIVERY

02:37:12.656 --> 02:37:13.624
SYSTEMS THAT WE NEED TO BE

02:37:13.690 --> 02:37:14.992

02:37:15.058 --> 02:37:16.426
ULTIMATELY ENABLE PLANTS TO

JUST TO NAME A FEW. AND THEN

FINALLY- CONTINUE DH CS

02:37:24.268 --> 02:37:25.836
LEADERSHIP WILL BE CRITICAL. SO

02:37:25.903 --> 02:37:26.904
THIS WILL INCLUDE CLEAR AND

02:37:26.970 --> 02:37:28.238
TIMELY POLICY GUIDANCE

02:37:44.354 --> 02:37:45.823
NUMEROUS CALLIN PROPOSALS WHICH

02:37:45.889 --> 02:37:47.191
WILL REQUIRE RESOURCES IN

PLANNING AND PARALLEL TO

OUR PUBLIC HOSPITALS YOUR

02:52:43.886 --> 02:52:45.521

OF PLANS YOU HAVE PATIENTS AT

02:52:50.326 --> 02:52:51.561
THE OTHER END AND- YOU'RE

02:52:51.627 --> 02:52:52.962
ABSOLUTELY THE RELATIONSHIPS

02:52:53.029 --> 02:52:54.263

02:52:54.330 --> 02:52:56.299
IMPORTANT TO US AND SEE THIS AS

02:52:56.365 --> 02:52:59.435
THE- A NECESSITY TO MAKE SURE

02:52:59.502 --> 02:53:01.003
THAT THE CARE CONTINUES TO BE.

02:53:01.070 --> 02:53:02.905
CENTERED AROUND THE PERSON AND

02:53:02.972 --> 02:53:04.741
NOT SIMPLY IT COORDINATED

02:53:04.807 --> 02:53:06.576
PROGRAMS YOU COULD NOT AGREE

02:53:06.642 --> 02:53:07.877
WITH YOU MORE THAT THE MOST

02:53:07.944 --> 02:53:09.345
IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS. THAT

02:53:09.412 --> 02:53:11.047
NEED TO HAPPEN AND THE SHARED

02:53:11.114 --> 02:53:12.081
DECISION MAKING THAT NEEDS TO

02:53:12.148 --> 02:53:13.249
HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:53:13.316 --> 02:53:14.984
BETWEEN THE COUNTY PROVIDERS.

02:53:15.051 --> 02:53:16.953
AND THE PLANS IS EXACTLY AROUND

02:53:17.019 --> 02:53:18.755
HOW WE LEVERAGE THE EXISTING

02:53:18.821 --> 02:53:19.822
INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER THAT'S

02:53:19.889 --> 02:53:21.824
HUMAN RESOURCES THE PEOPLE WHO

02:53:21.891 --> 02:53:24.160
KNOW THESE PATIENTS. OR THE

02:53:24.227 --> 02:53:26.095
BRICKS AND MORTAR ALL OF IT I

02:53:26.162 --> 02:53:27.830
THINK THE BEST THING WE HAVE

02:53:27.897 --> 02:53:29.332
GOING FOR US IN THIS MOMENT IS

02:53:29.398 --> 02:53:31.267
THE VERY FACT THAT. PLANTS ARE

02:53:31.334 --> 02:53:33.035
BEING ASKED TO DO SO MUCH SO

02:53:33.102 --> 02:53:35.338
QUICKLY AND THAT THIS THERE AND

02:53:35.404 --> 02:53:36.973
BECAUSE THERE IS ALREADY

02:53:37.039 --> 02:53:38.775
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND

02:53:38.841 --> 02:53:39.942
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT NOT

02:53:40.009 --> 02:53:41.277
EVERYWHERE BUT MORE OFTEN THAN

02:53:41.344 --> 02:53:42.512
NOT THERE ARE TRUSTED

02:53:42.578 --> 02:53:44.347
RELATIONSHIPS I'M AND LOCAL

02:53:44.413 --> 02:53:46.549
DIALOGUE AND PEOPLE ARE ALREADY

02:53:46.616 --> 02:53:47.183
STARTING TO ROLL UP THEIR

02:53:47.250 --> 02:53:49.452
SLEEVES SO. I'M PERHAPS NOT

02:53:49.519 --> 02:53:51.654
CONFIDENT BUT HOPEFUL THAT WE

02:53:51.721 --> 02:53:54.157
WILL- WE WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT

02:53:54.223 --> 02:53:58.161
YOU SAY AND- AND- FIND WAYS AT

02:53:58.227 --> 02:53:59.529
THE LOCAL LEVEL TO MAKE SURE WE

02:53:59.595 --> 02:54:01.197
ARE NOT LETTING ANYTHING.

02:54:01.264 --> 02:54:02.765
SPECIALLY THOSE RELATIONSHIPS

02:54:02.832 --> 02:54:05.535
WITH PATIENTS WHETHER ON MINE.

02:54:05.601 --> 02:54:09.305
SO IF I DO NOT. HOW WE'VE- WE

02:54:09.372 --> 02:54:10.139
MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND ON THEM IN

02:54:10.206 --> 02:54:12.775
THE A- IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN

02:54:12.842 --> 02:54:13.976
WHEN YOU THINK OF CASE

02:54:14.043 --> 02:54:14.777
MANAGEMENT THAT'S BEEN DONE

02:54:14.844 --> 02:54:17.346
TRADITIONALLY MOSTLY BY PLANS

02:54:17.413 --> 02:54:19.382
TELEPHONIC CASE MANAGEMENT

02:54:19.448 --> 02:54:20.917
SEPARATED FROM THE DELIVERY

02:54:20.983 --> 02:54:22.885
SYSTEM THE ABSOLUTE EXPECTATION

02:54:22.952 --> 02:54:24.554
HERE IS THAT. THESE ENHANCE

02:54:24.620 --> 02:54:26.122
CARE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES

02:54:26.189 --> 02:54:28.658
ARE AT THE FRONT LINES THIRTEEN

02:54:28.724 --> 02:54:30.359
THE PERSON'S HOME BUT THERE IN

02:54:30.426 --> 02:54:30.993
THE PERSON'S HOME WITH A

02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:32.662
TRUSTED INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY

02:54:32.728 --> 02:54:34.130
MAY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH IN

02:54:34.197 --> 02:54:35.298
THE CLINIC WHERE THERE WERE

02:54:35.364 --> 02:54:36.165
THEIR SERVICES ARE BEING

02:54:36.232 --> 02:54:37.900
PROVIDED WHETHER THAT'S A

02:54:37.967 --> 02:54:40.136
COUNTY CLINIC AN FQHC OR

02:54:40.203 --> 02:54:42.538
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC WHERE

02:54:42.605 --> 02:54:44.740
THE MOST TRUSTED RELATIONSHIP.

02:54:44.807 --> 02:54:47.877
IS BETWEEN THAT PERSON AND THE

02:54:47.944 --> 02:54:48.945
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT

02:54:49.011 --> 02:54:50.146
PLACE THEY ARE NOT MAYBE THE

02:54:50.213 --> 02:54:51.714
ONLY PLACE THEY'RE GOING AND SO

02:54:51.781 --> 02:54:53.482
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF AND HEALTH

02:54:53.549 --> 02:54:54.684
CARE MANAGEMENT IS REALLY

02:54:54.750 --> 02:54:56.519
DELIVERING IT AT THAT LEVEL

02:54:56.586 --> 02:54:58.821
WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL IS SO

02:54:58.888 --> 02:55:00.056
THAT'S IN THEIR PRIMARY CARE

02:55:00.122 --> 02:55:02.191
SIDE THAT'S IN THERE BEHAVIORAL

02:55:02.258 --> 02:55:04.060
HEALTH SIDE THAT'S IN THERE IF

02:55:04.126 --> 02:55:05.995
YOU DECIDE THAT IN THE PLACES

02:55:06.062 --> 02:55:08.130
WHERE THEY ARE. WHETHER THAT'S

02:55:08.197 --> 02:55:09.365
YOU KNOW I COUNTY CLINIC

THAT HAS THAT RELATIONSHIP SO I

02:55:15.104 --> 02:55:15.738
THINK THAT'S WHERE WE TALK

02:55:15.805 --> 02:55:17.607
ABOUT. IT'S REALLY NOT AN

02:55:17.673 --> 02:55:18.875
EXPECTATION THAT THE PLAN WILL

02:55:18.941 --> 02:55:20.042

DELIVERING A LOT OF THIS THERE

02:55:22.011 --> 02:55:23.546
REALLY IS AN EXPECTATION THAT

02:55:23.613 --> 02:55:24.380
THE PARTNERING WITH THE

02:55:24.447 --> 02:55:25.982

FIRST SO I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S

02:59:51.046 --> 02:59:53.516
DEFINITELY A BIG CONCERN FOR US

02:59:53.582 --> 02:59:54.350
AT THIS POINT. YEAH THE ONLY

02:59:54.416 --> 02:59:55.584
THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD

02:59:55.651 --> 02:59:56.852
ADD IS JUST HAVING CONVERSATION

02:59:56.919 --> 02:59:58.354
ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND

02:59:58.420 --> 02:59:59.522
WHAT GOES INTO DEVELOPING THE

02:59:59.588 --> 03:00:01.457
RATE SO. ADDITION TO TIMING

03:00:01.524 --> 03:00:03.592
KIND OF. WHAT WHAT WHAT'S

03:00:03.659 --> 03:00:06.829
BEHIND THE RATE. OKAY NOW LIKE

03:00:06.896 --> 03:00:07.730
I GUESS THE QUESTION OF THE

03:00:07.796 --> 03:00:10.900
POSE ACT. GIVEN TESTIMONY FROM

03:00:10.966 --> 03:00:13.669
LESTER CENTER THAT. THERE ARE

03:00:13.736 --> 03:00:16.672
SOME CONCERNS THAT THEM THAT

03:00:16.739 --> 03:00:18.707
SOMETIMES THERE ARE SOME PLANS

03:00:18.774 --> 03:00:20.910
WHO MAY NOT NECESSARILY-

03:00:20.976 --> 03:00:21.877
PERFORM AS WELL AS WE'D LIKE

03:00:21.944 --> 03:00:23.779

03:00:23.846 --> 03:00:25.181
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES DO YOU

03:00:25.247 --> 03:00:27.583
THINK THE- I CAN CERTAINLY ASK

03:00:27.650 --> 03:00:28.551
THE AGENCY WHAT THEY WOULD DO

03:00:28.617 --> 03:00:29.685
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE

03:00:29.752 --> 03:00:30.686
PLANS THAT YOU COULD DO THAT

03:00:30.753 --> 03:00:32.154
REASSURE ADVOCATES LIKE THE

03:00:32.221 --> 03:00:34.790
WESTERN CENTER. THAT WITH THAT-

03:00:34.857 --> 03:00:38.460
THAT. THAT THAT. THAT BASICALLY

03:00:38.527 --> 03:00:39.962
WHAT WE'LL GET THE EXPECT YOU

03:00:40.029 --> 03:00:40.663

SERVICES PEOPLE EXPECT SO- WHAT

03:00:43.132 --> 03:00:46.101
KIND OF- ACCOUNTABILITY

03:00:46.168 --> 03:00:48.370
MEASURES DO YOU THINK. WOULD BE

03:00:48.437 --> 03:00:50.339
APPROPRIATE TO THAT YOU'D SEE

03:00:50.406 --> 03:00:52.308
THAT SHOULD BE IMPOSED ON

03:00:52.374 --> 03:00:53.642
YOURSELVES THAT WOULD ASSURE

03:00:53.709 --> 03:00:55.945
THAT- PATIENTS- WOULD THEY ARE

03:00:56.011 --> 03:00:57.580
BUT THEY FISHERIES WOULD GET

03:00:57.646 --> 03:00:59.782
THE SERVICES THAT DAY THAT THEY

03:00:59.848 --> 03:01:04.019
NEED. AND I'D I THINK IT

03:01:04.086 --> 03:01:06.455
PROBABLY AT LEAST. AS FAR AS

03:01:06.522 --> 03:01:08.123
WHERE WE ARE NOW WITH IT-

03:01:08.190 --> 03:01:09.558
IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AND

03:01:09.625 --> 03:01:11.760
PLANNING I THINK IT IT PROBABLY

03:01:11.827 --> 03:01:14.496

03:03:42.144 --> 03:03:43.612
THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL.

03:03:43.679 --> 03:03:45.114
BUT I THINK THERE ALSO HAS TO

03:03:45.180 --> 03:03:55.657
BE A- A PLAN- IT- THE- LEADING

03:03:55.724 --> 03:03:56.892
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE CAL AIM

03:03:56.959 --> 03:03:59.995
AS WELL AS TO THE RECOGNITION

03:04:00.062 --> 03:04:03.799
THAT- BETTER SERVING PATIENTS-

03:04:03.866 --> 03:04:05.067
AND I DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

03:04:05.134 --> 03:04:06.769
COST RAVERS NECESSARILY WILL

03:04:06.835 --> 03:04:09.471
BUT BUT THAT THAT. AS POINTED

03:04:09.538 --> 03:04:13.609
OUT- THIS WILL BENEFIT- IN IN

03:04:13.675 --> 03:04:15.611
THE LONG RUN AND SO TAKING THAT

03:04:15.677 --> 03:04:20.916
GOT APPROACH MORE- BUT- IF THE

03:04:20.983 --> 03:04:22.418
PLANS ARE LOOKING FOR GREATER

03:04:22.484 --> 03:04:24.753
MEASUREMENTS AND- ENFORCEMENT

03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:26.722
WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOME SOME

03:04:26.789 --> 03:04:28.757
THOUGHT. OKAY THE BILL I THINK

03:04:28.824 --> 03:04:31.727
YOU KNOW WITH THE NEW PROGRAM

03:04:31.794 --> 03:04:32.327
YOU START WITH PROCESS MEASURE

03:04:32.394 --> 03:04:32.961
SOMETHING YOU TALK ABOUT SOME

03:04:33.028 --> 03:04:33.862
OF THINGS ABOUT TAKED ABOUT IN

03:04:33.929 --> 03:04:35.097
TERMS OF. YOU LOOK AT

03:04:35.164 --> 03:04:36.498
TRANSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:04:36.565 --> 03:04:37.699
INDIVIDUALS BEING SERVED NOW

03:04:37.766 --> 03:04:38.801
MOVE OVER YOU LOOK AT NEW

03:04:38.867 --> 03:04:40.502
ENROLLMENT YOU LOOK AT HOW MANY

03:04:40.569 --> 03:04:41.370
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY BEING

03:04:41.437 --> 03:04:42.871
SERVED. YOU HAVE TO GET THE

03:04:42.938 --> 03:04:43.972
OUTCOME MEASURES EVENTUALLY

03:04:44.039 --> 03:04:44.973
THEY'RE NOT JUST FINANCIAL

03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:46.241
OUTCOME MEASURES THERE ARE

03:04:46.308 --> 03:04:47.609
MEASURES THAT LOOK AT DID YOU

03:04:47.676 --> 03:04:48.610
MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITH THAT

03:04:48.677 --> 03:04:50.712
PERSON THE REALITY OF THAT THAT

03:04:50.779 --> 03:04:53.048
TAKES TIME I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK

03:04:53.115 --> 03:04:53.549
AT A HOUSING PROGRAM FOR

03:04:53.615 --> 03:04:55.350
EXAMPLE. YOU HAVE TO STABILIZE

03:04:55.417 --> 03:04:56.952
A PERSON IN THE HOUSING YOU

03:04:57.019 --> 03:04:58.220
MADE THE POINT THAT OFTEN YOU

03:04:58.287 --> 03:04:59.755
THEN GET UNMET NEED THAT COMES

03:04:59.822 --> 03:05:00.889
OUT IT'S ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU

03:05:00.956 --> 03:05:02.424
NOW HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT

03:05:02.491 --> 03:05:04.126
YOU'RE PROVIDING MORE. YOU KNOW

03:05:04.193 --> 03:05:05.294
MEDICATIONS TO YOUR PROVIDING

03:05:05.360 --> 03:05:06.628
MORE PRIMARY CARE VISITS MORE

03:05:06.695 --> 03:05:09.798
SPECIALTY VISITS IT'S GOING TO

03:05:09.865 --> 03:05:10.365
TAKE TIME TO REALLY SEE ANY

03:05:10.432 --> 03:05:11.233
OUTCOME MEASURES THAT ARE

03:05:11.300 --> 03:05:14.069
CERTAINLY BASED ON YOU KNOW

03:05:14.136 --> 03:05:14.636
BETTER HEALTH STATUS OF THE

03:05:14.703 --> 03:05:15.704
MEMBER. SO I THINK WOULD REALLY

03:05:15.771 --> 03:05:17.906
BE STARTING AROUND PROCESS. AND

03:05:17.973 --> 03:05:19.408
I THINK YOU KNOW BOTH BOWS

03:05:19.475 --> 03:05:20.476
POINT ABOUT. THERE IS THERE IS

03:05:20.542 --> 03:05:22.811
THAT HAVE. YOU KNOW NO CAPACITY

03:05:22.878 --> 03:05:23.712
AT THE MOMENT SO THE- THE

03:05:23.779 --> 03:05:25.147
PROCESS MEASURES. DEVELOPING

03:05:25.214 --> 03:05:26.815
CAPACITY. SO I THINK THOSE ARE

03:05:26.882 --> 03:05:28.350
THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE

03:05:28.417 --> 03:05:29.751
WOULD BE LOOKING OUT INITIAL.

03:05:29.818 --> 03:05:31.553
BUT CERTAINLY I THINK DEAL WITH

03:05:31.620 --> 03:05:32.120
THAT PART OF IT IS TRYING TO

03:05:32.187 --> 03:05:35.324
SET. EXPECTATIONS INCLUDE

03:05:35.390 --> 03:05:36.458
CLINICS THAT EXPECTATIONS

03:05:36.525 --> 03:05:37.493
THAT'S WHY WE HAD THE WHOLE

03:05:37.559 --> 03:05:39.995
DIALOGUE ALSO ABOUT LIKE. WHAT

03:05:40.062 --> 03:05:41.463
WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN DURING THE

03:05:41.530 --> 03:05:42.965
TRANSITION MAY NOT BE.

03:05:43.031 --> 03:05:44.533
NECESSARY THE SAME AS WHAT WE

03:05:44.600 --> 03:05:45.634
ANTICIPATE WILL HAPPEN AT THE

03:05:45.701 --> 03:05:46.702
END GOAL BECAUSE IT IS A

03:05:46.768 --> 03:05:47.936
TRANSITION AND SO THINGS

03:05:48.003 --> 03:05:49.238
HAPPENED DURING TRANSITIONS AND

03:05:49.304 --> 03:05:51.039
ALSO HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY OR

03:05:51.106 --> 03:05:52.741
TO CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH.

03:05:52.808 --> 03:05:54.243
UNEXPECTED THINGS AS WELL

03:05:54.309 --> 03:05:55.544
BECAUSE AS MUCH AS WE MIGHT

03:05:55.611 --> 03:05:56.778
PREDICT UNTIL WE ACTUALLY TRY

03:05:56.845 --> 03:05:58.313
IT SOME THINGS DON'T ALWAYS

03:05:58.380 --> 03:05:59.715
TURN OUT THE WAY WE INITIALLY

03:05:59.781 --> 03:06:02.818
PROJECT SO- BE SURE WE BILL THE

03:06:02.885 --> 03:06:04.119
LITTLE IN THERE FOR THAT AS

03:06:04.186 --> 03:06:07.856
WELL. YES I JUST WANTED TO

03:06:07.923 --> 03:06:10.259
PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS ON-

03:06:10.325 --> 03:06:12.561
CAPACITY AND LACK THERE OF AND-

03:06:12.628 --> 03:06:14.363
THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

03:06:14.429 --> 03:06:15.197
WE BROUGHT UP AROUND WORK

03:06:15.264 --> 03:06:17.666
FORCE. SCA YOU HAVE SEPARATE

03:06:17.733 --> 03:06:19.234
BUDGET AND LEGISLATIVE ASK

03:06:19.301 --> 03:06:21.603
AROUND TRYING TO THINK. REALLY

03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:23.238
CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW WE BUILD

03:06:23.305 --> 03:06:25.340
UP OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

03:06:25.407 --> 03:06:27.276
PROVIDERS AND ALSO OUR EXISTING

03:06:27.342 --> 03:06:29.244
SOCIAL SERVICES WORKERS YOU'LL

03:06:29.311 --> 03:06:31.313
SEE OUR BUDGET LETTER ON THOSE-

03:06:31.380 --> 03:06:32.948
TOPICS BUT THEY'RE ALL. ALL

03:06:33.015 --> 03:06:35.083
INTERRELATED AND WITHIN THE CAO

03:06:35.150 --> 03:06:37.386
AIMS SPACE WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED

03:06:37.452 --> 03:06:39.354
THE NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL I

03:06:39.421 --> 03:06:40.656
SEEING THE SPACE WEATHER

03:06:40.722 --> 03:06:42.024
THROUGH PEER CERTIFICATION ARE

03:06:42.090 --> 03:06:44.993
ACTUAL. LICENSING AND SO FOR US

03:06:45.060 --> 03:06:46.161
THAT'S- ONE OF OUR TOP

03:06:46.228 --> 03:06:48.196
PRIORITIES WE UNDERSTAND THAT

03:06:48.263 --> 03:06:49.231
YOU KNOW THE PLANTS CAN'T

03:06:49.298 --> 03:06:51.033
PROVIDE SERVICES OR TO COUNTIES

03:06:51.099 --> 03:06:52.167
CAN'T PROVIDE SERVICES IF WE

03:06:52.234 --> 03:06:53.569
DON'T HAVE ACTUALLY ADVOCATE

03:06:53.635 --> 03:06:54.736
WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO

03:06:54.803 --> 03:06:58.173
PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. AND SO

03:06:58.240 --> 03:06:58.740
WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AND

03:06:58.807 --> 03:07:00.375
ALSO THAT. TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

03:07:00.442 --> 03:07:02.711
A BETTER WAY OF CERTIFICATION

03:07:02.778 --> 03:07:04.346
AND LICENSING AND ALSO

03:07:04.413 --> 03:07:08.050
INVESTING ADDITIONAL MONIES FOR

03:07:08.116 --> 03:07:09.585
THAT WORK FORCE PIECE. AND

03:07:09.651 --> 03:07:11.420
THEN- ONE OTHER QUESTION IN

03:07:11.486 --> 03:07:13.755
TERMS OF THE ENHANCE THE CARE

03:07:13.822 --> 03:07:14.923
MANAGEMENT BECAUSE WE TALKED

03:07:14.990 --> 03:07:17.492
ABOUT WELL THAT'S 1% SINCE THE

03:07:17.559 --> 03:07:18.827
BEGINNING OF A REALIZE THAT

03:07:18.894 --> 03:07:22.564
CENTER RIGHT BUT BASICALLY. AT

03:07:22.631 --> 03:07:25.467
SO- SO I'M ASSETS CERTAINLY THE

03:07:25.534 --> 03:07:27.102
A UNDERSTAND MAKES

03:07:27.169 --> 03:07:29.271
CONCENTRATE ON THE ALL THAT THE

03:07:29.338 --> 03:07:31.039
MOST CHALLENGING AND OFTENTIMES

03:07:31.106 --> 03:07:35.277
MOST EXPENSIVE. THAT SWEAR LOG.

03:07:35.344 --> 03:07:38.313
AND HOW DO YOU SEE SOME OF THE

03:07:38.380 --> 03:07:39.514
THINGS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING

03:07:39.581 --> 03:07:41.917
UNDER ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT.

03:07:41.984 --> 03:07:45.153
PERHAPS THAT AND BEING.

03:07:45.220 --> 03:07:46.555
AVAILABLE MAYBE NOT THE RIGHT

03:07:46.622 --> 03:07:48.690
WORD BUT THEN INFORMING AND

03:07:48.757 --> 03:07:50.492
THEN THAT ALSO DEVELOP A

03:07:50.559 --> 03:07:52.294
SERVICES FOR THE REMAINING

03:07:52.361 --> 03:07:53.762
POPULATION THAT ACCOUNT RIGHT

03:07:53.829 --> 03:07:56.765
SO RIGHT. SO YES I KNOW THIS IS

03:07:56.832 --> 03:07:57.766
THE GROUP THAT NEEDS IT THE

03:07:57.833 --> 03:08:00.002
MOST AND WE ALSO HAVE AND NOT

03:08:00.068 --> 03:08:01.236
EVERYTHING IS ABOUT MONEY TO

03:08:01.303 --> 03:08:02.537
BUT IT'S BOTH THE IMPROVED

03:08:02.604 --> 03:08:03.905
REYES OPTING FOR QUALITY AND

03:08:03.972 --> 03:08:05.240
THE COOK BUT IS ALSO BASS

03:08:05.307 --> 03:08:06.875
OPTING FOR SAVINGS AS WELL. BUT

03:08:06.942 --> 03:08:09.378
THEN AS WE ARE ROLLING THIS OUT

03:08:09.444 --> 03:08:10.646
WE'RE DEVELOPING THE EXPERIENCE

03:08:10.712 --> 03:08:13.548
AND SO FORTH SO- AND SOME OTHER

03:08:13.615 --> 03:08:14.883
PEOPLE I SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT

03:08:14.950 --> 03:08:16.952
I HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS NEEDS

03:08:17.019 --> 03:08:19.988
NOT. BUT SINCE THAT PERSON YET

03:08:20.055 --> 03:08:21.490
MIKE THIS THIS AND THIS CAN I

03:08:21.556 --> 03:08:23.058
GET ONE OF THOSE FOR THIS THAT

03:08:23.125 --> 03:08:24.292
WOULD HELP THAT PERSONALIZE A

03:08:24.359 --> 03:08:25.994
WHAT WHAT DO WHAT DO YOU SEE-

03:08:26.061 --> 03:08:27.429
AND IT AND AGAIN YEAH I DON'T

03:08:27.496 --> 03:08:28.830
KNOW HOW THIS INTERFACES WITH

03:08:28.897 --> 03:08:29.798
WITH THE WITH THE WAIVER OR

03:08:29.865 --> 03:08:32.300
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO AND YOU

03:08:32.367 --> 03:08:33.368
FRY HAVE NOTHING IT'S JUST

03:08:33.435 --> 03:08:34.736
ROUGHLY A ROLL OUT THIS PART

03:08:34.803 --> 03:08:35.804
BUT I DID AT THE BT YOU KNOW

03:08:35.871 --> 03:08:37.806
PEOPLE SAY IT WILL GO AGO- WELL

03:08:37.873 --> 03:08:39.374
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ABOUT. NOW I

03:08:39.441 --> 03:08:40.308
HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S PRETTY YOU

03:08:40.375 --> 03:08:42.277
KNOW THEY'RE NOT THAT 95% THERE

03:08:42.344 --> 03:08:44.346
AT THE 90% BASED OFF A LOT OF

03:08:44.413 --> 03:08:46.048
NEEDS NOT AS MUCH. BUT AND

03:08:46.114 --> 03:08:47.149
MAYBE THEY GOT ONE OF THESE IN

03:08:47.215 --> 03:08:48.817
LIEU SERVICES DATE COULD THAT

03:08:48.884 --> 03:08:50.152
BE REALLY REALLY HELPFUL FOR

03:08:50.218 --> 03:08:51.887
THEM THEY DON'T NEED. THREE OF

03:08:51.953 --> 03:08:53.655
THEM ARE FIVE OF THEM AT THAT

03:08:53.722 --> 03:08:55.123
THEN YOU SAY WELL BUT YOU'RE

03:08:55.190 --> 03:08:56.591
NOT IN THE IN HEALTHCARE

03:08:56.658 --> 03:08:58.493
MANAGEMENT DO YOU THE SO WHAT

03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:03.799
WHAT HOW. HOW HOW DO YOU SEE

03:09:03.865 --> 03:09:05.467
THIS. THERE'S A PIECE IT BEING

03:09:05.534 --> 03:09:06.001
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

03:09:06.068 --> 03:09:06.601
DIDN'T TALK A LOT ABOUT TODAY

03:09:06.668 --> 03:09:07.302
BUT IS IN CAL MS ARE. HEALTH ME.

03:09:07.369 --> 03:09:08.170
STRATEGY SEES SO WE WILL

03:09:08.236 --> 03:09:09.137
REQUIRE THAT THE MANAGED CARE

03:09:09.204 --> 03:09:10.839
PLANS ANNUALLY SUBMIT TO THE

03:09:10.906 --> 03:09:12.207
DEPARTMENT. I'M NOW STARTING

03:09:12.274 --> 03:09:13.909
JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO

03:09:13.975 --> 03:09:14.443
BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO

03:09:14.509 --> 03:09:15.243
STAGGER BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE

03:09:15.310 --> 03:09:16.812
I HAVE A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS OR

03:09:16.878 --> 03:09:19.514
MANAGED CARE PLANS- BUT- THAT

03:09:19.581 --> 03:09:21.049
THAT THE SUBMIT TO US AN ANNUAL

03:09:21.116 --> 03:09:22.250
POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT

03:09:22.317 --> 03:09:24.086
STRATEGY WITH. IN THAT STRATEGY

03:09:24.152 --> 03:09:24.853
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

03:09:24.920 --> 03:09:26.088
COMPONENTS OF WHICH WE WOULD BE

03:09:26.154 --> 03:09:27.823
LOOKING AT. ONE IS RESTRAINED

03:09:27.889 --> 03:09:29.124
EDUCATION AND LOOKING AT HOW DO

03:09:29.191 --> 03:09:30.826
WE IDENTIFY WITH IN OUR

03:09:30.892 --> 03:09:32.861
POPULATIONS THOSE WHO ARE. LOW

03:09:32.928 --> 03:09:34.896
RISK- THOSE WHO ARE MEDIUM ARE

03:09:34.963 --> 03:09:36.865
RISING RISK AND THEN THOSE OR

03:09:36.932 --> 03:09:38.533
WHO ARE HIGH RISK. I'M AND THEN

03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:39.901
THOSE WHO HAVE NO DATA IN ORDER

03:09:39.968 --> 03:09:41.203
FOR US NOT TO KNOW KIND OF WHAT

03:09:41.269 --> 03:09:42.871
AND THEN WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS

03:09:42.938 --> 03:09:44.473
OF WHAT PLANS DO AFTER THAT.

03:09:44.539 --> 03:09:46.341
THIS KIND OF THREE FOUR KIND OF

03:09:46.408 --> 03:09:47.843
MAIN PIECES OF OUR POPULATION

03:09:47.909 --> 03:09:49.144
HEALTH MANAGEMENT IS ON THE

03:09:49.211 --> 03:09:50.178
BACKBONE OF THE NCQA

03:09:50.245 --> 03:09:52.347
REQUIREMENTS TO COMPLEMENT. OF

03:09:52.414 --> 03:09:53.381
THOSE PIECES BUT IT REALLY HAS

03:09:53.448 --> 03:09:54.216
TO DO WITH STARTING WITH THE

03:09:54.282 --> 03:09:55.717
PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN MY ON

03:09:55.784 --> 03:09:57.085
THE SERVICES OF. MANAGED CARE

03:09:57.152 --> 03:09:58.420
PLANS THROUGH THAT POPULATION

03:09:58.487 --> 03:09:59.488
HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY THIS

03:09:59.554 --> 03:10:01.556
GETS TO THE- NINETY NINE OR

03:10:01.623 --> 03:10:02.524
NINETY EIGHT YOU KNOW DEPENDING

03:10:02.591 --> 03:10:03.992
ON WHICH- PERCENT OF PEOPLE.

03:10:04.059 --> 03:10:05.460
HOW ARE YOU MAKING SURE PEOPLE

03:10:05.527 --> 03:10:07.596
ARE GETTING PREVENTIVE SERVICES

03:10:07.662 --> 03:10:08.196
THEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

03:10:08.263 --> 03:10:08.964
TELLING US HOW YOUR MONITORING

03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:10.031
THAT. ADDITION TO OUR

03:10:10.098 --> 03:10:11.333
REQUIREMENTS THAT MOVIE ROLL

03:10:11.399 --> 03:10:13.034
OUT FOR THE AUDIT PROCESS. BUT

03:10:13.101 --> 03:10:14.536
THAT IS A CORE COMPONENT OF HOW

03:10:14.603 --> 03:10:15.704
ARE YOU KEEPING PEOPLE HEALTHY

03:10:15.771 --> 03:10:17.272

INTERVENTION SO THAT'S ONE

03:10:19.841 --> 03:10:21.543
COMPONENT. THE OTHER IS

03:10:21.610 --> 03:10:23.378
IDENTIFYING RISKY NEEDS OF.

03:10:23.445 --> 03:10:24.880
USING DATA TO DRIVE AND

03:10:24.946 --> 03:10:26.381
IDENTIFY RISKY NEED RATHER

03:10:26.448 --> 03:10:27.916
THROUGH MORE COMPLEX READ

APPROACH- AND THEN BEING ABLE

03:10:33.388 --> 03:10:34.790
TO SAY OKAY TO DATE WE HAVE

03:10:34.856 --> 03:10:36.391
THIS DIAGRAM THAT WE USE IN OUR

NOT NECESSARILY ENHANCE CARE

MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. THROUGH

03:11:25.173 --> 03:11:26.308
RICH STRATIFICATION BETTER DATA

03:11:26.374 --> 03:11:27.976
ANALYTICS AND PREDICTIVE

03:11:28.043 --> 03:11:29.311
MODELING WE ARE HOPING THAT

03:11:29.377 --> 03:11:31.079
OVER TIME WE CAN GET TO A PLACE

03:11:31.146 --> 03:11:32.180
WHERE WE- ARE I. ABLE TO

03:11:32.247 --> 03:11:33.682
IDENTIFY FUTURE GAPS AND THEN

03:11:33.748 --> 03:11:34.983
BRING SOLUTIONS TO THOSE GAPS

03:11:35.050 --> 03:11:36.484
WHAT WHATEVER THEY MAY BE. A

03:11:36.551 --> 03:11:37.319
BUT WE REALLY FEEL LIKE THE

03:11:37.385 --> 03:11:38.386
POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT

03:11:38.453 --> 03:11:39.988
STRATEGY. IS IT IS THE

03:11:40.055 --> 03:11:41.723
FOUNDATION AND THAT ENHANCE

03:11:41.790 --> 03:11:42.991
CARE MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF KIND

03:11:43.058 --> 03:11:44.192
OF TUCKED UNDERNEATH THAT.

03:11:44.259 --> 03:11:45.327
THERE'S TWO OTHER COMPONENTS

03:11:45.393 --> 03:11:46.194
THE POPULATION HEALTH

03:11:46.261 --> 03:11:47.295
MANAGEMENT STRATEGY ONE IS

03:11:47.362 --> 03:11:48.430
IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING

03:11:48.496 --> 03:11:49.898
SOCIAL DETERMINES OF HELP WHICH

03:11:49.965 --> 03:11:50.999
WE FEEL LIKE. THE LIEU OF

03:11:51.066 --> 03:11:53.235
SERVICES PACKAGE HELPS BRING-

03:11:53.301 --> 03:11:55.036
BUT THAT'S JUST ONE COMPONENT

03:11:55.103 --> 03:11:56.571
OF THAT. ON SO WE WILL BE

03:11:56.638 --> 03:11:57.939
REQUIRING THAT ARE MANAGED CARE

03:11:58.006 --> 03:11:59.307
PLANS ON THROUGH PROVIDERS

03:11:59.374 --> 03:12:01.676
IDENTIFIED SOCIAL THE TERMS OF

HEALTH AND REPORT THAT TO ICD

03:12:02.911 --> 03:12:04.546
TEN DATA TO THE DEPARTMENT.

03:12:04.613 --> 03:12:06.081
WE'VE SEEN. A LOT OF SUCCESS

03:12:06.147 --> 03:12:07.349
WITH THIS AND OTHER STATES.

03:12:07.415 --> 03:12:08.917
REALLY DO A GOOD JOB OF

03:12:08.984 --> 03:12:10.585
IDENTIFYING THAT THE MORE DATA

03:12:10.652 --> 03:12:11.753
THAT WE HAVE THE MORE HOT

03:12:11.820 --> 03:12:13.321
SPOTTING AND OTHER ANALYTICS WE

03:12:13.388 --> 03:12:14.322
CAN LOOK AT TO LOOK AT

03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:16.091
OPPORTUNITY STATEWIDE. A FOR

03:12:16.157 --> 03:12:17.292
FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN THE

03:12:17.359 --> 03:12:19.094
PROGRAM. AND THE LAST BUT

03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:20.695
DEFINITELY NOT THE LEAST IS WE

03:12:20.762 --> 03:12:21.897
NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB AT

03:12:21.963 --> 03:12:23.632
TRANSITIONS ACROSS CARE. ON

03:12:23.698 --> 03:12:25.267
BOTH BETWEEN TRANSITIONS ACROSS

03:12:25.333 --> 03:12:27.135
OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS AS WELL AS

03:12:27.202 --> 03:12:28.670
WITHIN A DELIVERY SYSTEMS OF AN

03:12:28.737 --> 03:12:29.871
IN PATIENT DOES CHARGE A

03:12:29.938 --> 03:12:30.805
SKILLED NURSING FACILITY

03:12:30.872 --> 03:12:32.474
DISCHARGED. AND ALL OF THOSE

03:12:32.540 --> 03:12:33.742
REQUIREMENTS ARE CURRENTLY LAID

03:12:33.808 --> 03:12:35.477
OUT IN OUR POPULATION HEALTH.

03:12:35.543 --> 03:12:37.579
PROPOSAL ON THOSE PIECES WILL

03:12:37.646 --> 03:12:38.813
TAKE TIME TO ROLLOUT BUT THAT

03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:40.148
WE REALLY FEEL LIKE IT IS ONE

03:12:40.215 --> 03:12:41.716
OF THE FOUNDATIONAL PIECES. TO

03:12:41.783 --> 03:12:43.985
BUILD ECM AND OVER TIME UP

03:12:44.052 --> 03:12:45.120
THROUGH THE PIECES THAT I JUST

03:12:45.186 --> 03:12:46.521
MENTIONED WE WILL BE ABLE TO

03:12:46.588 --> 03:12:48.290
IDENTIFY. FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES

03:12:48.356 --> 03:12:50.558
AND GAPS TO FILL. SO IT TO. PUT

03:12:50.625 --> 03:12:52.093
IN WHAT ONE COULD ARGUE AND I

03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:53.428
THINK LINDA'S POINTS IN MJ'S

03:12:53.495 --> 03:12:54.829
POINTS ARE ARE LEGITIMATE

03:12:54.896 --> 03:12:56.831
ABOUT. CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW

03:12:56.898 --> 03:12:58.133
NOT EVERYTHING BEING DELIVERED

03:12:58.199 --> 03:12:59.534
THE WAY IT SHOULD. THE PLANS

03:12:59.601 --> 03:13:01.202
RESPONSIBLE FOR A 100% OF THE

03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:03.605
POPULATION. AND SO. EVEN AS I

03:13:03.672 --> 03:13:07.242
THINK ABOUT ECM THAT'S PART OF

03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:08.009
A CONTINUUM OF CARE COORDINATOR

03:13:08.076 --> 03:13:08.610
XIN BASIC CARE MAY. THERE TO

03:13:08.677 --> 03:13:10.145
TERMS YOU CAN USE THAT. COMPLEX

03:13:10.211 --> 03:13:11.680
AND ANY CM I MEAN. TO

03:13:11.746 --> 03:13:14.082
IDENTIFYING MEMBERS NEEDS IS A

03:13:14.149 --> 03:13:15.250
IS A CORE PART OF HEALTH PLANS

03:13:15.317 --> 03:13:16.918
AND- MULTIPLE OPENS ARE

03:13:16.985 --> 03:13:17.986
INSECURE ACCREDITED THEY

03:13:18.053 --> 03:13:20.155
ALREADY HAVE POPULATION HEALTH

03:13:20.221 --> 03:13:21.823
MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. ONE COULD

03:13:21.890 --> 03:13:23.158
ARGUE THAT YOU SHOULD DO

03:13:23.224 --> 03:13:24.592
POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT

03:13:24.659 --> 03:13:26.294
WELL FIRST AND THEN BACK IN BUT

03:13:26.361 --> 03:13:27.662
IT'S REALLY A TIMING ISSUE

03:13:27.729 --> 03:13:29.764
BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO

03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:30.999
MAKE THE TRANSITION FOR ALL

03:13:31.066 --> 03:13:32.634
PERSON CARE. TO SOME EXTENT

03:13:32.701 --> 03:13:34.769
HEALTH HOMES INTO THE ECM

03:13:34.836 --> 03:13:37.639
PROGRAM DELIVER THE IOS. AND

03:13:37.706 --> 03:13:38.840
ADDING POPULATION OF MANAGEMENT

03:13:38.907 --> 03:13:40.141
ON TOP OF THAT FOR HEALTH PLANS

03:13:40.208 --> 03:13:41.142
WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY REALLY

03:13:41.209 --> 03:13:43.378
DIFFICULT. SO YOU KNOW THE

03:13:43.445 --> 03:13:44.279
DECISION WAS MADE TO DELAY THAT

03:13:44.346 --> 03:13:45.947
A YEAR BUT THE REALITY IS

03:13:46.014 --> 03:13:46.514
PLANTS ARE GONNA HAVE TO GO

03:13:46.581 --> 03:13:48.116
THROUGH THIS PROCESS THEY'RE

03:13:48.183 --> 03:13:49.250
GONNA TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE

03:13:49.317 --> 03:13:51.019
THEIR MEMBERS. LAND TO YOUR

03:13:51.086 --> 03:13:53.555
POINT OF YES THIS GROUP IS

03:13:53.621 --> 03:13:54.856
INELIGIBLE AND FITS THE

03:13:54.923 --> 03:13:56.057
CRITERIA FOR AND HEALTH CARE

03:13:56.124 --> 03:13:57.392
MANAGEMENT WELL WE JUST FOUND

03:13:57.459 --> 03:13:58.126
THIS OTHER MEMBER THROUGH OUR

03:13:58.193 --> 03:13:59.928
PROCESS. THAT IS GOING TO NEED

03:13:59.995 --> 03:14:02.597
HELP AS WELL SO EXPECTATION IS

03:14:02.664 --> 03:14:03.465
THIRD ANGER HUNDREDS OF THE

03:14:03.531 --> 03:14:05.700
PEOPLE THERE'S A SPECIFIC FOCUS

03:14:05.767 --> 03:14:07.035
ON IN HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT

03:14:07.102 --> 03:14:07.902
BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAM THE

03:14:07.969 --> 03:14:10.605
ROLLING. SO JUST TO CLARIFY IS

03:14:10.672 --> 03:14:12.374
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND

03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:13.742
DOING FEEL POPULATION

03:14:13.808 --> 03:14:15.310
MANAGEMENT AND SO FORTH IN SAID

03:14:15.377 --> 03:14:16.478
IRRESPONSIBLE AND PERCENT OF

03:14:16.544 --> 03:14:21.383
POPULATION- EVENTUALLY I MEAN

03:14:21.449 --> 03:14:23.218
AS YOU DO REST RATIFICATION.

03:14:23.284 --> 03:14:24.486
RIGHT YOU GOING OKAY WE GOT THE

03:14:24.552 --> 03:14:25.987
HIGHEST RISK WE GOT THE NEXT

03:14:26.054 --> 03:14:28.223
HIGHEST RISK AND SO FORTH. DO

03:14:28.289 --> 03:14:30.425
YOU SEE SOME OF THE ECM.

03:14:30.492 --> 03:14:32.527
SERVICES BEING AVAILABLE TO

03:14:32.594 --> 03:14:33.595
RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:14:33.661 --> 03:14:35.630
TARGETING THE HIGHEST RISK TO

03:14:35.697 --> 03:14:36.831
SOME OF THE LOWER RISK YOU

03:14:36.898 --> 03:14:38.600
COULD. BE THAT IS THE USE

03:14:38.666 --> 03:14:39.868
DESERVE GONNA BE A BARRIER TO

03:14:39.934 --> 03:14:41.302
DOING THAT OR DO YOU SEE THAT

03:14:41.369 --> 03:14:42.904
HAPPENING EVENTUALLY. AS A

03:14:42.971 --> 03:14:44.172
PROVIDE PLAZA PROVIDING RECOUP

03:14:44.239 --> 03:14:46.107
PART OF CARE RIGHT NOW OKAY IN

03:14:46.174 --> 03:14:47.842
THAT GROUP OF CARE IS FOR. A

03:14:47.909 --> 03:14:49.411
PATIENT THAT I MAKE SENSE FOR

03:14:49.477 --> 03:14:50.245
THE TECH AND ACUTE CARE

03:14:50.311 --> 03:14:51.880
FACILITY RIGHT SO AS LONG AS IT

03:14:51.946 --> 03:14:53.281
MAKES SENSE FOR THEM THERE'S NO

03:14:53.348 --> 03:14:55.150
BARRIER TO. FOR IBM IS A

03:14:55.216 --> 03:14:57.085
SPECIFIC SET OF CRITERIA OF A

03:14:57.152 --> 03:14:59.354
POPULATION. BUT NOW IT IT'S OUR

03:14:59.421 --> 03:15:00.989
EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT. A

03:15:01.056 --> 03:15:02.157
PERSON NEEDING RECOVERED OF

03:15:02.223 --> 03:15:03.858
CARE IS A PERSON IS OKAY I JUST

03:15:03.925 --> 03:15:04.559
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE IN

03:15:04.626 --> 03:15:05.794
TERMS OF THE WAIVERS OR

03:15:05.860 --> 03:15:06.861
WHATEVER ELSE THAT YOU HAVE TO

03:15:06.928 --> 03:15:08.463
APPLY FOR THAT WOULD TREATING

03:15:08.530 --> 03:15:10.432
RESTRICTIONS FOR SO IF IT'S IN

03:15:10.498 --> 03:15:11.900
THE PROPOSAL THAT'S FOR WE HAVE

03:15:11.966 --> 03:15:13.668
AS ECM AND- THIS IS THE GREATER

03:15:13.735 --> 03:15:15.036
VCM YOU FALL OUTSIDE THIS

03:15:15.103 --> 03:15:18.339
CRITERIA AND THE DEPENDING HOW

03:15:18.406 --> 03:15:19.374
TIGHT THE CRITERIA WRITTEN. SO

03:15:19.441 --> 03:15:20.075
I JUST THAT'S WHAT JUST

03:15:20.141 --> 03:15:22.510
CHECKING ON BIKE SO. WE I MEAN

03:15:22.577 --> 03:15:24.345
WE ARE TRYING TO WE ARE TRYING

03:15:24.412 --> 03:15:25.513
TO STRIKE THE BALANCE OF

03:15:25.580 --> 03:15:27.115
STANDARDIZATION OR- A

03:15:27.182 --> 03:15:28.383
STATEWIDE. BUT ALLOWING

03:15:28.450 --> 03:15:29.918
FLEXIBILITY FOR PLANS TO MAKE%

03:15:29.984 --> 03:15:31.419
DECISIONS ON WHITE BREAD WAS

03:15:31.486 --> 03:15:33.021
MENTIONING. BECAUSE I THINK YOU

03:15:33.088 --> 03:15:34.422
KNOW WE WANT TO HAVE GENERAL

03:15:34.489 --> 03:15:36.157
CRITERIA THE COMPLEXITY THAT

03:15:36.224 --> 03:15:37.392
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ELEVATING

03:15:37.459 --> 03:15:38.626
THE- ELIGIBILITY OF WHO SHOULD

03:15:38.693 --> 03:15:39.661
BE GETTING THIS TYPE OF

03:15:39.727 --> 03:15:41.196
BENEFIT. PLANS ARE REALLY GOOD

03:15:41.262 --> 03:15:42.430
HAVE TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS

03:15:42.497 --> 03:15:43.932
BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL IN
