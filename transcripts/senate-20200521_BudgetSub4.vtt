PURPOSE UNDER THE FEDERAL

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:30.427
STATUTES TO. AND FOR THE FACT

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:31.562
THAT UNDER THE FEDERAL LAWS

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:33.297
ALSO THIS MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:36.767
BY DECEMBER THIRTIETH. TWO

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:37.768
THOUSAND TWENTY. AND SO THE

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:23.834
CRISIS. AND ALSO TO. GIVE A TOM

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.435
TO THE MONEY THAT FOUR HUNDRED

00:48:25.502 --> 00:48:26.036
FIFTY MILLION FOR THE CITIES

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.070
AND ONE POINT THREE BILLION

00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:28.538
DOLLARS THE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE

00:48:28.605 --> 00:48:32.943
THAT TO THEM SO THEY CAN USE.

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:33.510
FOR KOBE RELATED PURPOSES AS

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:34.645
WELL. THE ROLE OF THE ALLOWABLE

00:48:34.711 --> 00:48:38.215
USES. I'M HAPPY SAID ABOUT. THE

00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:39.116
PROJECT ROOM SHE ONE OF THE

THAT THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:45.555
WHAT WAY IS THE ABILITY OF THE

PERMANENT BASIS AND TO PROVIDE

SERVICES I'LL ALSO BE SOMETHING

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:55.165
THAT COULD BE A CONSIDERATION

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:57.100
SO- YES YOU ARE CORRECT IN THAT

00:48:57.167 --> 00:48:58.935
WE GET HELP TO DEPART SOMEWHAT

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:00.404
FROM WHAT WAS OUR INITIAL

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.805
PROPOSAL IN THE FALL BUT WE

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:02.539
STILL THINK THAT THIS

00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:04.608
MAINTAINS. A LOT OF THE KEY

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:06.243
ELEMENTS WITHIN THE PARAMETERS

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:08.679
OF THE OF THE- MONEY THAT'S

00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:11.081
AVAILABLE. AND THEN. ONE MORE

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:13.250
QUESTION RIGHT NOW MEDICARE.

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:15.052
THE MAINTENANCE OF ACQUIRED OR

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.120
LEASED PROPERTIES- WHAT ARE

00:49:17.187 --> 00:49:18.555
YOUR PROVISIONS FOR THE

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:20.424
MAINTENANCE OF SAID PROPERTIES

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.659
WHETHER THE STATE IS REQUIRED

00:49:22.726 --> 00:49:25.295
AT OR IS LEASING IT. YES THE

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:27.064
MAINTENANCE THIS IS A KNOWN

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:29.499
THAT'S UNKNOWN FACTOR THAT THE

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:30.967
MONEY TO PURCHASE OF SIX

00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:31.702
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LACKEY

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.603
MAINTAINS AND SO THAT'S WHY

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.639
EACH CD WORLD CONSIDERS CARTER

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:37.407
APPLICATION PROCESS THE ABILITY

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:40.544
OF THOSE. LOCALS TO RECEIVE

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:41.978
THAT MONEY TO PURCHASE COPIES

00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:45.515
ON A PERMANENT BASIS. TO

00:49:45.582 --> 00:49:46.083
MAINTAIN THOSE PROPERTIES AS

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:47.584
WELL. UNFORTUNATELY THE FEDERAL

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:48.919
MONEY ITSELF COULD NOT BE USED

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:50.654
FOR THOSE MAINTENANCE PURPOSES

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:51.955
BECAUSE IT SUCKS. IT'S THE

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:53.623
EXPENDITURE DEEP DEADLINE OF

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:56.059
DECEMBER. AND WELL MAYBE THIS

00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:57.994
FOLLOW THIS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF

00:49:58.061 --> 00:49:59.496
THE REPORTED HOMELESS

00:49:59.563 --> 00:50:01.865

THOUSAND THOSE ARE STILL RIGHT

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:24.654

AND HOMELESSNESS SIDE I HAVE A

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:13.603
REAL CONCERN ABOUT THAT

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.806
BECAUSE- OVER THE LAST FEW

00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:17.007
YEARS AND I'VE ONLY BEEN TO MY

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:18.875
SECOND YEAR HERE BUT I KNOW

00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:20.177
THAT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:23.313
IS SUCH OF CRISIS. AT SUCH A

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.649
CRISIS LEVEL AND THERE'S SUCH

00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:27.350
ENORMOUS NEED WE'VE BEEN

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:29.519

BUILD AND REALLY- IMPLEMENT

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:41.398
SOME SERIOUS FOCUSED STRATEGIC

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:44.501
POLICIES THAT GET US YOU KNOW

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:46.102
THAT HELP US TO MAKE PROGRESS

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:48.004
HERE WE HAVE THE OF A WHAT IS

00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:51.441
IT A MILLION AND A HALF OF MORE

00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:53.743
OR LESS UNITS OF AFFORDABLE

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.580
HOUSING THERE ARE NEEDED IN THE

00:51:56.646 --> 00:51:58.014
STATE. I LIKE TO KNOW WHY WOULD

00:51:58.081 --> 00:52:00.217
WE NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:04.287
FUNDING. TO ADD TO THE TOOLS OF

00:52:04.354 --> 00:52:08.291
POLICIES ADD TO THAT FUNDING SO

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:09.125
THAT IT JUST DOESN'T GET

00:52:09.192 --> 00:52:11.094
SCATTERED I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:12.896
THERE ARE ENORMOUS NEEDS RIGHT

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:17.000
NOW BUT- WHY NOT. WHY GIVE SO

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:19.336
MUCH FLEXIBILITY TO BE USED

00:52:19.402 --> 00:52:21.771
OTHERWISE RATHER THAN LIMITING

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:23.306
THAT TO HOUSING AND

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:27.277
HOMELESSNESS. YES SENATOR WE

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:28.812
HAVE THE- APPROXIMATELY TWO

00:52:28.879 --> 00:52:29.980
POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:31.214
THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE IN

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:32.883
SIERRA MONEY STATES PROVIDING

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:34.918
TO LOCALS- SIX HUNDRED MILLION

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:38.855
WILL RIGHT OFF THE TOP BE USED

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:40.323
TO SERVE ON. HOMELESS PERSONS.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.726
JEFF RANKING. AND THEN- BUT THE

00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:43.260
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:44.394
DOLLARS THAT'S WILLING TO

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:46.463
CITIES AND COUNTIES- OUR

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.532
EXPECTATION IS THAT CITIES.

00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:50.000
WILL BE WORKING BUT THERE ARE

00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:52.736
CONTINUOUS CARE NURSE COUNTIES

00:52:52.802 --> 00:52:55.005
TO GO AHEAD AND- REX ANY MONIES

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:56.339
THAT ARE USED THE SERVER BUT

00:52:56.406 --> 00:52:57.974
ALMOST COMMUNITIES ON A WAY

00:52:58.041 --> 00:52:59.442
THAT COORDINATES WITH ONGOING

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:01.912
EFFORTS AND SERVICES. THAT OUR

00:53:01.978 --> 00:53:04.347
EXPECTATION THAT THAT. SOME OF

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:05.181
THAT MONEY I CAN'T PUT A DOLLAR

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:06.650
AMOUNT ON IT BUT SOME OF THAT

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:08.351
MONEY WILL ALSO BE USED TO

00:53:08.418 --> 00:53:09.786
SERVE THE HOMELESS-

00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:11.454
INDIVIDUALS. AND AS FAR AS THE

00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:13.356
COUNTY MONEY GOES THE ONE POINT

00:53:13.423 --> 00:53:15.392
THREE BILLION DOLLARS- THERE'S

00:53:15.458 --> 00:53:16.793
NOT A STRICT REQUIREMENT THAT

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.296
MONEY BE USED TO ANSWER- THE

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:21.364
HOME ALMOST POPULATION BECAUSE

00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:23.800
OF THE FACT THAT. WITH THE- THE

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:27.003
CURRENT CRISIS AND- THE MANY

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.205
REVENUE LOSSES THAT COUNTIES

00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:32.742
AND CITIES AND- IN ADDITION A

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:35.612
LARGE SERVICE LOADS. BY YOU

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:37.280
SOME U. PEOPLE WE RECOGNIZE

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:39.482
THAT. FLEXIBILITY TO GO AHEAD

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:40.684
AND USE THAT MONEY FOR OTHER

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.686
PURPOSES AS WELL HEALTH AND

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:44.888
HUMAN SERVICES. WE RELATED

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:47.757
THINGS ON THE- FEDERAL LAW SO

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:51.094
WE'RE SOME FLEXIBILITY. WELL I

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:53.163
WOULD CONTINUE TO INSIST- AND

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:56.333
URGE YOU TO- CHANGE THAT AND

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:59.669
MAKE IT MORE OF A FOCUS WE IT

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:03.406
BEFORE THIS COURT PANDEMIC.

00:54:03.473 --> 00:54:05.575
HOUSING WAS NOT GETTING BUILT.

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:07.811
ON AND THEN WE STARTED MOVING

00:54:07.877 --> 00:54:09.579
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IT'S

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:11.681
GOING TO BE ANOTHER REASON WHY

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:13.550
CITIES OR COUNTIES DON'T USE

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:15.185
THE FUNDING FOR HOUSING AND

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:17.220
HOMELESSNESS SO I THINK UNLESS

00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:19.522
WE HAVE A COORDINATED POLICY IN

00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:21.324
FUNDING STRATEGY IT'S GONNA

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:23.960
IT'S GONNA SLIP AWAY AND IT'S

00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:26.062
GOING TO GO BACKWARDS- I HAVE A

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:29.132
SPECIFIC ONE ABOUT THE ROOM KEY

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:31.568
UP IN LOS ANGELES I THINK RIGHT

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:35.672
NOW. IT SERVING ABOUT TWENTY

00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:40.543
FIVE HUNDRED- INDIVIDUALS- AND

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:42.012
MAYBE SOME MORE SITES COMING

00:54:42.078 --> 00:54:43.913
AND SO MY CONCERN IS. WHAT'S

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.850
THE TRANSITION PLAN. FOR THE

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:48.918
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOW IN

00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:52.055
THAT- IN THOSE ROOMS IN THAT

00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:56.393
KIND OF HOUSING- OF. YOU KNOW

00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:57.894
FOR LEAVING YOU KNOW AND THE

00:54:57.961 --> 00:55:01.031
TRANSITION. IT WAS THIS JUST A

00:55:01.097 --> 00:55:03.066
QUICK YOU KNOW LET'S GET THEM

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:05.035
OUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC GET

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:06.670
THEM OFF THE STREETS IF IT

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:09.673
DOESN'T HAVE YOU KNOW REAL

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:11.608
ACCESS TO JOB TRAINING

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:13.677
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES-

00:55:13.743 --> 00:55:15.245
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OTHER

00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:16.646
THINGS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT JUST

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:19.215
GONNA WRITE BACK QUICKLY GET ON

00:55:19.282 --> 00:55:20.550
THE STREETS AND WE'RE WE'RE

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:23.019
BACK ROW. MAYBE EVEN WORSE OFF

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:25.689
THAN WHERE WE STARTED SO WHAT'S

00:55:25.755 --> 00:55:27.624
THE TRANSITION PLAN. THE

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:29.793
TRANSITION PLAN IS THAT- WE DO

00:55:29.859 --> 00:55:30.960
RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW THAT

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:32.562
IS. SHORT TERM HOUSING RIGHT

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:34.330
NOW THE SECURE NAY SO TELLS IN

00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:36.566
MOTELS. BUT THE GUIDING

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:37.901
PRINCIPLE BEHIND PROJECT ROOMS

00:55:37.967 --> 00:55:39.269
IN THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:40.870
DOLLARS ALL OVER EXISTS TO

00:55:40.937 --> 00:55:42.205
ATTEMPT TO SECURE AS MANY OF

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:44.407
THOSE PROPERTIES. ALL FOUR

00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:45.709
MINUTE BASIS SO THAT THOSE

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:47.277
INDIVIDUALS FOR BEING HOUSE AND

00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:48.845
THERE ARE. TEMPORARILY RIGHT

00:55:48.912 --> 00:55:50.814
NOW. SHOULD HAVE A PERMANENT

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.482
OPPORTUNITY FOR HOUSING IN

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:54.150
THOSE FACILITIES OR OTHER

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:56.086
SIMILARLY SITUATED FACILITIES.

00:55:56.152 --> 00:55:57.053
AND SO THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.288
THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND

00:55:58.354 --> 00:55:59.889
PROJECT ROOM KEY IN THIS PART

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:02.358
OF THE- COST US. WE'RE GONNA

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:06.563
BUT TEMPERATURES. WELL THE

00:56:06.629 --> 00:56:07.797
PROJECT PROPERTY FUND WITH

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:09.432
MONIES THAT. THAT THEY HAVE A

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:11.501
VIABLE PLAN GOING FORWARD TO

00:56:11.568 --> 00:56:12.902
CONTINUE TO OPERATE THIS

00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:14.204
FACILITIES BECAUSE WE DO

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:15.405
RECOGNIZE THIS IS ONE PINE

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:17.173
MONEY IT'S EASY TO PURCHASE THE

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.542
PROPERTY. CHIEF OPERATIONS.

00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:21.544
THING SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A

00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:23.513
FACTOR AS WELL. AND THEN

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.717
FINALLY- MENTIONED. CONTROL

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:30.620
SECTION ELEVEN NINETY. IN THIS

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:34.257
ON THE USE OF THAT WHAT IS.

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:35.992
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS A

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:40.363
PROPOSAL THAT. THAT THAT WOULD

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:43.233
BE INCLUDED IN THERE OF YOU

00:56:43.299 --> 00:56:46.536
KNOW PRETTY MUCH NO NOTICE- NO

00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:48.571
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WHAT IS

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:50.440
IT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL THAT YOU

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:54.377
WOULD THINK THAT OF CONTROL

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:57.113
SECTION ELEVEN NINETY IS NEEDED

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.048
THANK GETS NEEDED BECAUSE OF

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:01.417
THE IMMEDIACY OF CRISIS- WE

00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:02.018
WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:03.887
MONEY OUT TO- MORE LOCAL

00:57:03.953 --> 00:57:06.389
CORPORATE. ORDERS AS QUICKLY AS

00:57:06.456 --> 00:57:09.125
POSSIBLE STE. RIGHT SERVICES TO

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:10.894
THESE PEOPLE ARE MOST IN NEED

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:15.031
AND- THAT STEPS THE GUIDING

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:17.367
PRINCIPLE BEHIND BEING ELEVEN

00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:19.536
NINETY EIGHT AND YOU THINK THAT

00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:20.703
NOT HAVING LEGISLATIVE.

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:24.407
OVERSIGHT OR HAVING LEGISLATIVE

00:57:24.474 --> 00:57:26.276
OVERSIGHT WOULD STOP YOU FROM

00:57:26.342 --> 00:57:28.678
GETTING THOSE FUNDINGS ON. WE

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:29.879
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.381
STOP US FROM GETTING THE MONEY

00:57:31.447 --> 00:57:33.249
OUT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT WE WANT

00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:34.384
TO FOR THE MANY OUT AS SOON AS

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:36.920
POSSIBLE AND I AM NOT IN A

00:57:36.986 --> 00:57:37.687
POSITION TO MAKE ANY

00:57:37.754 --> 00:57:39.989
COMMITMENTS- ON BEHALF OF THE

00:57:40.056 --> 00:57:40.723
ADMINISTRATION BUT I THINK

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:43.393
THAT. I DO THINK THAT WE WOULD

00:57:43.459 --> 00:57:46.396
CERTAINLY. BUT AT LEAST.

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:48.398
TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE WITH ON

00:57:48.464 --> 00:57:49.566
THE LEGISLATURE HOW THE MONEY

00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:51.401
IS BEING USED IN TWO OR SHARE

00:57:51.467 --> 00:57:53.870
INFORMATION REGARDING HOW- HOW

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:56.906
THE MONEY'S GOING OUT AND IS

00:57:56.973 --> 00:57:59.742
USING AT BUT SENATE SHE- AND

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.411
JUST AND MADAM CHAIR I THINK

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:03.546
THAT'S A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE AND

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:07.450
I FOR ONE. WOULD URGE THAT- BUT

00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:10.153
WE HAVE TO HAVE OF NOT JUST A

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:11.855
NOT EVEN JUST A NOTICE WE NEED

00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:15.325
MORE SERIOUS- INVOLVEMENT AN

00:58:15.391 --> 00:58:18.995
ENGAGEMENT ANDS AND SUPPORT FOR

00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:20.697
MAYBE NOT SUPPORT FROM THE

00:58:20.763 --> 00:58:23.900
LEGISLATION SO. THAT'S THAT'S

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:26.669
MY LAST COMMENT ON THAT. THANK

00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:28.972
YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR DR SO I

00:58:29.038 --> 00:58:30.807
I'LL START ON THAT ON THAT

00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:32.575
PARTICULAR NOTE IN AND SAY I

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:34.143
APPRECIATE THE INTERESTING

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:35.478
GETTING THEM OUT MONEY OUT AS

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:38.615
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- BUT THE

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:40.683
AYE AYE AYE I SECOND THE

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:42.719
CONCERNED THAT SENATOR DRAWS-

00:58:42.785 --> 00:58:45.255
HAS WHICH WHICH IS THAT THAT-

00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:46.923
THE LEGISLATURE IT THERE IS A

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:49.325
ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN IN

00:58:49.392 --> 00:58:51.060
THIS DISCUSSION AND- WILL HAVE.

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:52.462
THIS ISSUE COME UP A NUMBER OF

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:53.630
OTHER ON A NUMBER OF OTHER

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:55.531
ITEMS AND I THINK WE CAN

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:56.966
PROBABLY SAY DITTO FOR THOSE AS

00:58:57.033 --> 00:59:00.169
WELL- IT AT THE ELEVEN IDEA TO

00:59:00.236 --> 00:59:03.973
BE USED VERY. VERY

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:07.944
STRATEGICALLY AND- AND- I'LL

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:09.445
TELL YOU ONE OF THE REASONS I'M

00:59:09.512 --> 00:59:12.515
CONCERNED IS- IN MY DISTRICT I

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:14.784
HAVE FOR COMMUNITIES. FOR

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:17.754
CITIES THAT ARE OVER FORTY

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:18.688
THOUSAND PEOPLE IT THEN THERE

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:20.790
FROM 400-002-0060 THOUSAND

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:22.558
PEOPLE SO THEY GOT NO DIRECT.

00:59:22.625 --> 00:59:25.795
FUNDS FROM THE CARE ACT- IT

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:27.864
THAT THE CITY'S NEEDED TO BE

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:28.398
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE

00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:31.534
LARGER. AND SO MOST OF THE THIS

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:33.836
THE CITIES AND I'VE GOT TWENTY

00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:36.039
EIGHT CITIES. ARE A LOT SMALLER

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:40.343
THERE FROM THIRTY THOUSAND TO-

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:41.377
SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND THE

00:59:41.444 --> 00:59:44.647
PROBLEM IS THAT- THERE. THOSE

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:46.149
ARE THE CITIES AND I'VE HEARD

00:59:46.215 --> 00:59:47.250
FROM ALL OF THE MAYORS THAT ARE

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:48.518
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

00:59:48.584 --> 00:59:50.019
THEY'VE HAD THE IN AN IMPACT IN

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:52.388
THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY'RE

00:59:52.455 --> 00:59:53.656
GETTING NO RELIEF AND NO NO

00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:56.259
RESOURCES AND THEY'RE CONCERNED

00:59:56.326 --> 00:59:58.594
AT THAT THERE ARE- MAJORITY

00:59:58.661 --> 00:59:59.696
FARM WORKER COMMUNITIES WITH

00:59:59.762 --> 01:00:01.798
THEM- BLUE COLLAR WORKERS AND

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:03.499
SO THEY THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:04.701
LOT OF REVENUES AND YET THIRD

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.470
THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE SOME- SOME

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:09.339
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND SOME-

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:10.573
THEY'VE HAD TO EXPEND FUNDS

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.176
BECAUSE OF THIS VIRUS AND SO-

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:15.745
THE- THE IDEA OF HAVING TO GO

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:16.813
THROUGH THE COUNTY HAS THEM

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:18.381
CONCERNED BECAUSE MOST OF THEM

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.383
FILL IT DON'T GET NO MONEY FROM

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.284
THE COUNTIES AND I HAVE SIX

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:24.854
COUNTIES. IN IN IN THE- THE

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.022
DISTRICT AND SO ALL OF THEM ARE

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:27.256
SAYING THE SAME THINGS WHICH IS

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:29.792
THAT- IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:30.860
FOR THEM TO GET MONEY DIRECTLY

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.729
FROM THE STATE THAT THAT'S THE

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:34.197
WAY THEY'D LIKE TO RECEIVE IT

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.064
RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THIS.

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:36.332
THROUGH THE COUNTY'S NUMBER ONE

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:37.867
AND NUMBER TWO IS MANY OF THEM

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:39.769
WILL NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:41.104
KINDS OF THINGS THEY CAN USE

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:42.238
THEM FOR SO THAT THEY DON'T END

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.206
UP GETTING THEMSELVES IN

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.874
TROUBLE SO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:47.610
WOULD BE- A GOOD THING AS WELL

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:48.978
EVEN IF IT'S JUST A LIST OF THE

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:50.113
KINDS OF THINGS. WE CAN USE IT

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:53.416
FOR- LIKE MASKS AND PROTECTIVE

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.818
EQUIPMENT AND- DEVICES THEY'VE

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.987
HAD TO INSTALL LIKE THESE KIND

01:00:58.054 --> 01:01:00.123
OF PLEXIGLAS THOSE KINDS OF

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:03.192
THINGS- SO I RECOMMEND THAT WE

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:05.762
LOOK AT- NOT ALLOCATING THE

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:07.063
FUNDS THROUGH THE COUNTIES

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.332
THEY'RE LOCATED. ON THAT. CAN

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:12.835
BE DONE BY BY POPULATION WE DO

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:15.505
IT ALL THE TIME- SO THAT

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.740
THAT'S- IN THE ISSUE THAT CAN.

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.242
TURN THE PRICE ROOM KEY I'M I

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:23.479
THINK IT'S A BIT END OF A WAY

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:25.581
TO. BUY HOUSE HOMELESS BECAUSE

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:27.583
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WE HAVE

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:29.385
HOUSING UNITS AND SO IF YOU CAN

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:31.721
USE THING THAT EXISTS THAT

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:33.489
GREAT A GREAT IDEA BUT IF YOU

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:38.261
CAN AT. HAVE AND THE GRANT THEM

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:40.029
SET UP THROUGH EIGHT I'LL BE

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:41.564
REAL FRANK WITH YOU PROBABLY

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:46.069
MOST OF THE COMMUNITIES. IN MY

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:46.702
IN MY DISTRICT WANT WON'T HAVE

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:47.703
THAT UP. TO APPLY FOR IT THERE.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.238
THERE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:52.108
HOW THEY'RE GONNA. COULD EXIST

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:53.509
OVER THE THROUGH THEIR OWN

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:55.845
BUDGET PROCESS- THEY'RE MAKING

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:59.015
SOME TOUGH DECISIONS AND SO- I

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:00.917
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:02.819
FUNDS THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED TO

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:05.788
PURCHASE HOTELS OR MOTELS. IS

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:07.190
EQUALLY SPENT ALL OVER THE

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:09.058
STATE AND THAT IT DOESN'T END

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:11.127
UP GOING TO ONE COMMUNITY WHO'S

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:12.462
BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:15.131
BE ABLE TO. TO THE TWIST THE

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:17.333
ARMS OF HOTEL OWNERS TO BE ABLE

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.635
TO BUY BY THE HOTEL SO- THAT

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:21.037
HAVE BEEN HAVING HIS AND MY

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:22.538
GUESS IS IN ADDITION IS THAT

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:24.907
THE FACILITIES ARE GOING TO BE

01:02:24.974 --> 01:02:26.442
THE ONES THAT ARE. STARTING TO

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:27.944
FALL FALL DOWN BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:29.645
MORE LIKELY TO SELL YOUR HOTEL

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:31.647
AND MOTEL AND I'M THINKING OR

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:34.183
MOTELS- IF IT'S FALLING APART

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:36.986
SO- LONG TERM STRATEGY FOR HOW

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:38.521
TO KEEP THAT FACILITY GOING

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.322
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:42.125
IMPORTANT SO. THIS THIS IS ONE

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:43.593
CAN GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:45.394
HEARTBURN I GET WE NEED TO

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.163
SPEND THE MONEY TO. BUY A THE

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:50.867
ENDOF THE YEAR- AND- BUT I

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.168
ALSO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:54.237
NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED IN IN SOME

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:56.372
OF THESE DECISIONS SELF THIS IS

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:57.673
A HOLD WHY DON'T HAVE ANY

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:01.911
QUESTIONS I. AT THIS POINT BUT

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:03.246
I THINK IT WAS A REALLY GOOD

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:05.181
DISCUSSION IN MY QUESTIONS GOT

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:07.150
ANSWERED AT CENTER NIELSEN. LET

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:08.351
ME JUST INTERJECT ONE MORE

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:10.753
SPECIFIC THAT CERTAINLY RELATES

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.288
TO THE AREAS OF INTEREST TO THE

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:14.790
CHAIR AND MYSELF AND THAT WOULD

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:16.592
BE FARM WORKER HOUSING AT ANY.

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:18.394
PARTICULAR FOCUS ON FARM WORKER

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:25.601
HOUSING. I'M NOT SERVICES THAT-

01:03:25.668 --> 01:03:28.471
QUESTION- FARM WORKER HOUSING-

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.473
TAKE TO THE EXTENT THAT ALEX-

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.842

THIS IS BEING HELD OPEN SO

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.551
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:05.888

THE HOUSING FINANCE AUTHORITY

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:21.303
TO MOVE AGENCY AND HOUSING AND

CONSIDERATION TO RE DIRECT THAT

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:26.442
RESPONSIBILITY A LITTLE BIT FOR

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.244
GETTING MONEY OUT MORE

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:35.384
EXPEDITIOUSLY. IT IT IS. THAT'S

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:37.553
A BIG JUMP QUESTION I SUPPOSE I

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:38.087
SHOULD TO ASK FINANCE THAT

01:07:38.154 --> 01:07:45.594
QUESTION. IN. IT'S CAN SOMEBODY

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:47.696
FROM ABOVE FROM FINANCE I

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:49.064
BELIEVE THAT THE REPORT SAYS

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:50.533
THAT IT IS THAT KELLY CHIU

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:52.501
FADED THAT WOULD BE IN CHARGE

01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:55.838
OF ALLOCATING THE RESOURCES AND

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.072
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THEY'VE

01:07:57.139 --> 01:07:58.974
THEY'VE DEVELOPED A FIRST TIME

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:00.242
HOME BUYER BUYER PROGRAM IT AS

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:02.344
WELL AS A ROUTE AT AN ASSISTANT

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.779
MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:09.251
THAT. SO MY AT MY BIG CONCERN

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:10.386
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT TIMES IT'S

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:12.254
AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE-

01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:14.957
THIS IS A- THIS IS MONEY THAT

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:18.194
WAS- WAS PAID. DURING THE LAST

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.162
DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY BECAUSE

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:21.697
OF THE MORTGAGE MELTDOWN THAT

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:24.567
THAT OCCURRED BECAUSE OF FRAUD.

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:26.902
BY THE MORTGAGE- INDUSTRY AND

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:28.971
SO YOU KNOW AT THE BEGINNING OF

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:31.307
THE YEAR I WAS REALLY. FOCUSED

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:33.943
ON. BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:36.579
HOMEOWNERS- WERE BLUE COLLAR

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.481
WORKERS THAT HAD BOUGHT THEIR

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:40.316
HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME-

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:43.552
IDENTIFYING A WAY TO GET. THIS

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:45.087
MONEY TO CAL HFA AND THEN TO

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:48.524
HAVE THEM- I CREATE A FIRST

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.059
FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS PROGRAM

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:50.726
FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT LOST

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.228
THEIR HOUSES. SO THAT THEY

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:54.063
COULD ENTER THE THAT THE MARKET

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:59.602
AGAIN- AND- THE DIFFERENCE THAT.

01:08:59.668 --> 01:09:00.202
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS MAKES IS

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:01.370
THAT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:02.872
SENSE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:03.939
ARE JUST NOT IN A POSITION TO

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.474
BE ABLE TO BUY A HOUSE GIVEN

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:07.109
THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY. SO

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:08.544
I'M REALLY CONCERNED WITH THIS

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:10.913
BEING IS USED AS WISELY AS

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:13.249
POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE I AGREE

01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:14.984
WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:17.920
THAT- THE DOWNTURN IN THE

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:18.754
ECONOMY IS GOING TO PUT A LOT

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.756
OF PEOPLE AT RISK. AND AT RISK

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.091
OF HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS WHY

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:24.093
THE YOU KNOW HAVING. HAVING

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:25.628
UNITS TO PUT PEOPLE INTO

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.229
BECOMES VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:28.898
ALSO AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:30.499
HOMES AND SO. ON WE'RE GONNA

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:34.436
NEED A- SOME SOME. IT KELLY

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:36.238
CHIPPY IS I THINK A REALLY GOOD

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:38.874
ENTITY. TO REALLY FOCUS ON

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:39.475

WITH A WAY TO BE ABLE TO. HELP

01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:44.880
PEOPLE OUT SO THAT THEY DON'T

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:46.916
LOSE OUR HOME SO. THIS IS THIS

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:48.183
IS A HOLD OPEN I THINK IT'S

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:49.485
WORTH MORE DISCUSSION AND I

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:51.887
APPRECIATE THE- THE INTERESTING

01:09:51.954 --> 01:09:52.955
GETTING THE MONEY OUT AS

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:07.148
OUT THAT THERE REALLY IS AN

01:28:07.215 --> 01:28:08.549
OVERALL THEME TO ALL OF OUR

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:10.318
COMMENTS. WHICH IS THAT WHILE

01:28:10.385 --> 01:28:11.753
SOME NEW LANGUAGE MAY BE

01:28:11.819 --> 01:28:13.588
JUSTIFIED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:14.856
SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:16.190
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:18.526
COMPANY IN RESPONSE. OVERALL WE

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:19.060
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.561
PROPOSED PROCESS THESE THAT ARE

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:22.030
OUTLINED IN THE SECTIONS GO TOO

01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:23.331
FAR IN DELEGATING KEY

01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:26.834
LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY FOR

01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:27.268
EXAMPLE RELATED TO A

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:28.269
CORPORATION. SO SPECIFICALLY

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:29.771
WITH REGARD TO CONTROL SECTION

01:28:29.837 --> 01:28:31.305
ELEVEN POINT NINE HELLO. WE

01:28:31.372 --> 01:28:32.507
RECOGNIZE THAT AN ADDITIONAL

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:34.108
PROCESS BEYOND THE EXISTING

01:28:34.175 --> 01:28:35.343
CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:36.310
MIGHT BE WARRANTED FOR

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:37.679
ALLOCATING THESE FEDERAL FUNDS

01:28:37.745 --> 01:28:38.813
GIVEN. BUT THERE ARE

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:39.914
CONSTRAINTS ON THE CORONAVIRUS

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:41.816
REALLY FRIENDS AND THAT THERE'S

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:42.383
SOME URGENCY IN ALLOCATING

01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:44.018
THESE FUNDS. HOWEVER WE THINK

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:45.119
IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO

01:28:45.186 --> 01:28:47.055
MODIFY THIS PROCESS TO INCREASE

01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:48.990
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT- AND

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.291
INVOLVEMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:50.925
CURRENTLY THERE'S NO

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:53.161
NOTIFICATION. OR FORMAL

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:55.063
LEGISLATIVE IN FRIGHT ON ANY

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:56.964
REALLOCATION OF THIS FUNDING SO

01:28:57.031 --> 01:28:57.832
THERE'S- THE MINISTRATIONS

01:28:57.899 --> 01:28:59.434
PROVIDED SORT OF ROCK FUNDING

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.336
PLAN. BUT IF THOSE CHANGE- THE

01:29:02.403 --> 01:29:03.838
LEGISLATURE ISN'T ISN'T THERE'S

01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:05.273
NO NO FORMAL PROCESS FOR

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:08.409
NOTIFYING LEGISLATURE SEEKING

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:10.878
LEGISLATURE'S. ONE ON FOR MY

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:11.679
LANGUAGE WOULD BE. THAT THE

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:13.147
MINUTES PROVIDE NOTIFICATIONS

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:14.649
ABOUT FUNDS THEIR REALLOCATED

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:16.217
THROUGH THIS CONTROL SECTION.

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:17.618
INCLUDING REQUIRING SPECIFIC

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:18.619
INFORMATION IN THOSE

01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:19.987
NOTIFICATIONS TO ENSURE THAT

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:21.322
THE LEGISLATURE GET THE TYPE OF

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:23.057
INFORMATION NEEDS. AND WE ALSO

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:24.125
THINK IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.860
HAVE IN OUR REPORTING ON

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:27.628
SEPTEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:28.763
UNSETTLING WOULD HAVE KIND OF A

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.798
CHECK IN AT THAT POINT- AND

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:31.833
ENVISIONED POTENTIALLY

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:33.367
RELOCATIONS AT THAT POINT. SO

01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:35.503
THAT'S PROBABLY YEAH. LOGICAL

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:37.405
TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO GET

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:38.706
SOME REVISED INFORMATION FROM

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:39.574
THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.942
WHETHER THERE'S BEEN FULL TAKE

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:42.643
UP OF THE- PROGRAMS THAT

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:43.644
THEY'RE EXPECTING TO FIND UNDER

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:47.181
THIS AND- WHAT THEIR PLAN IS

01:29:47.248 --> 01:29:47.815
GOING FORWARD. VERY GOOD THANK

01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:48.916
YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:51.185
INFORMATION- QUESTIONS OR

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:52.920
COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:56.090
CENTER NIELSEN. MADAM CHAIR AND

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:59.460
MEMBERS THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:04.031
VERY BROAD. AND IF IT'S NOT NEW

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:05.800
THAT IS MEETING THE

01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:07.435
LEGISLATURE'S SEATING MORE AND

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:09.937
MORE AUTHORITY TO THE EXECUTIVE

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:12.106
BRANCH AND THE WHAT I CALL

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:14.342
ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH OF

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:17.645
GOVERNMENT THE FRONT. BUT IT'S

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:18.212
KIND OF COME TO A HEAD RIGHT

01:30:18.279 --> 01:30:21.749
NOW. THE CHAIRS AND VICE CHAIRS

01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:24.152
OF BOTH BUDGET COMMITTEES HAVE

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:25.953
RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THIS

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.389
TREND. OF LATE AT THIS

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.258
PARTICULAR TIME OF CRISIS MANY

01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:32.827
MEMBERS HAVE BEEN VOICING

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:36.164
CONCERNS ABOUT THE IT. AND ONE

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:38.266
OF THE OLD STRATEGIES WAS TO

01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:41.669
REQUIRE- BUDGET CONTROL

01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:44.505
LANGUAGE THE REQUIRED REPORTS.

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:47.308
THE LEGISLATURE. I'M TO THE

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:48.743
POINT WHERE I THINK THOSE ARE I

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:50.678
DON'T WANT HIM ANYMORE. REPORTS

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:52.013
MEAN NOTHING THEY GET FILED AND

01:30:52.079 --> 01:30:55.383
FORGOTTEN. BUT WE NEED ACTUAL

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:55.850
AUTHORITY CITATIONS OF

01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:59.187
AUTHORITY. AND RE DELEGATIONS

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:01.255
OF AUTHORITY TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:02.456
WE NEED TO REST SOME OF THAT

01:31:02.523 --> 01:31:05.293
CONTROL BACK. THAT IS A BROADLY

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:07.328
APPLICABLE ISSUE BUT PROBABLY

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:09.664
MORE SO IN MY OPINION IT THIS

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:12.233
MOST DESPERATE TIME OF ALL. WE

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.136
JUST HAVE TO A PAUCITY OF NOT

01:31:15.203 --> 01:31:17.705
MUCH OF WHAT'S GOING ON. AND WE

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:18.406
ARE RESPONSIBLE TO THE

01:31:18.472 --> 01:31:21.542
CITIZENS. AND IT'S NOT US. LARA

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:24.512
TORTILLAS MEMBERS. AS MUCH AS A

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:26.247
CHIEF FORTY OF THE VOTERS OF

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.082
CITIZENS THE CITIZENS OF

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:30.051
CALIFORNIA. AND NOT JUST THE

01:31:30.117 --> 01:31:32.620
VOTERS THE CITIZENS. THEY NEED

01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:34.088
TO KNOW AND I NEED TO HAVE

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:35.957
SOMEBODY WHO'S WATCHING THE

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:38.226
CHICKEN COOP. SO WE'RE GONNA

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:39.393
HAVE TO LEVEL LOTS OF

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.895
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS AS WE

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:43.831
PROCEED. AND AGAIN I SAY IT'S A

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:45.166
NO CRITICISM OF THIS PARTICULAR

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:46.667
ADMINISTRATION IT'S BEEN AROUND

01:31:46.734 --> 01:31:48.703
A LONG TIME BUT NOW WE'RE AT A

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:51.539
MORE CRITICAL TIME- A KINDLE

01:31:51.606 --> 01:31:52.773
WHEN WE WERE THAT MAYBE THE

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.675
PROP THIRTEEN YEARS WERE WORTH

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:57.445
A LITTLE SIMILAR. ABOUT TWENTY

01:31:57.511 --> 01:31:58.479
TEN TO TWENTY ELEVEN BROWN

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:01.349
FORTY FIVE BILLION IN THE RED

01:32:01.415 --> 01:32:01.916
THAT WAS ANOTHER SUCH TIME.

01:32:01.983 --> 01:32:02.516
I'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:04.552
AND I WATCH THIS HAPPEN. A DAY

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:06.854
BILL BY BILL DEAL WHEREBY DEAL

01:32:06.921 --> 01:32:08.322
LANDED POPPING UP RACIAL

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:12.260
MANUALS. AND THAT AND EIGHT

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:14.161
PIECE A MINISTRY DIRECTIVES.

01:32:14.228 --> 01:32:16.130
AND YOU KNOW THE MOST OF IT IS

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:17.832
NEVER BEEN CHALLENGED ILLEGALLY

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:19.667
BUT I THINK THAT THE

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:21.235
LEGISLATURE WOULD PREVAIL WHERE

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:23.638
THEY AND LET'S HOPE WE DON'T

01:32:23.704 --> 01:32:26.140
HAVE TO EVER GET TO THAT POINT.

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:29.911
ENTER DRAWS A SURE I'M I THINK

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:34.849
IT'S THE SAME I KNOW WE'RE

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:36.817
OR THREE AYE AGENDA ITEMS THAT

01:32:36.884 --> 01:32:39.553
REFERRED BASICALLY THE SAME

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:43.524
THING IS TO WHAT DEGREE. TO PUT

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:47.728
DEGREES- IS AS YOU SAID- OUR

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:50.364
ROLE AS LEGISLATURE SEATED TO

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:53.634
THE TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SO

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:54.568
I CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SAME

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:57.605
CONCERNS FRANKLY I JUST ONE

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:59.740
TECHNICAL QUESTION IS THIS ONLY

01:32:59.807 --> 01:33:04.045
USE FOR PURPOSES OF FUNDING. AS

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:07.081
FAR AS THIS KIND OF AUTHORITY

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:09.951
OR- YOU MEAN RECEIVING FEDERAL

01:33:10.017 --> 01:33:11.919
FUNDS THAT COME IN AND THEN YOU

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:12.720
DON'T KNOW I MEAN THE

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:16.490
AUTHORITY. UNDER THESE- FOR

01:33:16.557 --> 01:33:17.358
EXAMPLE LEAST THREE CONTROL

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:21.495
SECTIONS IS THAT ONLY FOR. IS

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:23.965
THAT A THIRTY ONLY ON ISSUES OF

01:33:24.031 --> 01:33:26.534
FUNDING OR CAN IT. CAN IT BE

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.170
USED FOR OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE

01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:32.340
NON FINANCIAL NON FUNDING THAT

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:36.544
MAKES US A QUESTION. MAYBE THE

01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:39.680
LA OWN. THAT MIGHT BE ABLE

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:41.182
INAPPROPRIATE QUESTION EITHER

01:33:41.248 --> 01:33:42.883
FOR FINANCE ARE FOR THE LA

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:44.919
FINANCE DEALS WITH FUNDING SO

01:33:44.986 --> 01:33:46.754
MAYBE MAYBE THE QUESTION SHOULD

01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:50.024
GO TO THE LA. SO MY

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:51.158
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS IS

01:33:51.225 --> 01:33:52.626
THAT THESE- KEITH IS A CONTROL

01:33:52.693 --> 01:33:54.128
SECTION BASICALLY ALLOCATE THE

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:55.629
FUNDING SO THAT. OF COURSE

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:57.331
THERE'S A THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:33:57.398 --> 01:33:58.466
POLICY CONSEQUENCES TO THAT

01:33:58.532 --> 01:33:59.967
BECAUSE IF YOU ALLOCATE FUNDING

01:34:00.034 --> 01:34:01.335
TO A SPECIFIC KIND OF NEW

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:02.770
ACTIVITY THAT THAT CERTAINLY

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:04.739
HAS SOME- SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:34:04.805 --> 01:34:06.440
QUALITY CONSEQUENCES BUT-

01:34:06.507 --> 01:34:07.541
REALLY THESE CONTROLS ACTIONS

01:34:07.608 --> 01:34:09.076
ARE- WHEN THEY WERE ANY

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:10.478
DISCUSSING ELEVEN POINT NINE

01:34:10.544 --> 01:34:12.546
NOW ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE AND

01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:13.481
THEN SECTION THIRTY SIX RELATE

01:34:13.547 --> 01:34:15.216
TO ALLOCATING. FEDERAL FUNDS

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:16.951
AND- LATER ON WE'LL DISCUSS

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:19.353
STATE AND I'M TO. ACTIVITIES

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:21.522
AND ALL RELATED TO COMMITTEE.

OKAY WELL JUST JUST ONE ONE

01:34:25.526 --> 01:34:26.360
FIVE THAT I HAD WAS. UP BYOND

01:34:26.427 --> 01:34:29.330
THE FUNDING- THAT WE OUGHT TO

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:31.298
THINK ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:36.237
THE ADMINISTRATION. HOW DO WE-

01:34:36.303 --> 01:34:39.774
MORE TO OF. THE OF JOB. IN THIS

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.442
IN THIS A IN THE TIME IN THIS

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:43.644
RECOVERY. HOW DO WE DO MORE FOR

01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:45.312
IT FOR JOB CREATION IF WE COULD

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:49.617
USE THAT AUTHORITY. TO EXPAND

01:34:49.683 --> 01:34:50.751
ON THAT ESPECIALLY WITH OUR-

01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:53.087
AMID PROCESS IT AND I KNOW A

01:34:53.154 --> 01:34:54.422
NUMBER OF ISSUES CAME UP OVER

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:55.756
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS ABOUT

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:56.924
THE KINDS OF CONTRACTS THAT

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:59.160
WERE ENTERED INTO. AND HOW CAN

01:34:59.226 --> 01:35:01.562
WE USE THE FUNDING IN SUCH A

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:03.564
WAY THAT REALLY BENEFITS JOB

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:05.399
CREATION ONE WORD MOST

01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:06.534
DESPERATE AND MOST NEED OF IT

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.502
SO JUST A THOUGHT THANK YOU

PERIOD. HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED

01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:34.662
OVER THE YEARS. BEYOND THE

CONTROL THE LEGISLATURE WITHOUT

ANY STATUTORY AUTHORITY. AND

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:40.101
THAT'S A SENSITIVE ISSUE AS

01:35:40.167 --> 01:35:44.038
WELL POLICY DOES COME IN AND I

01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:45.806
CALLED GOVERNOR LAFAYETTE WHEN

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:08.796
BUT I WAS READING THAT TO A%

01:36:08.863 --> 01:36:11.065
LEGAL DIMERA SEVERAL YEARS AGO

01:36:11.132 --> 01:36:13.100

CALTRANS. BUT THE JUDGE ASKED

01:36:20.374 --> 01:36:22.476
FOR A CITATION OF AUTHORITY.

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:24.078
AND THE RESPONSE WAS BECAUSE WE

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:26.981
ARE CALTRANS. THAT WAS A

01:36:27.047 --> 01:36:29.817
CITATION OF AUTHORITY. THAT WAS

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:33.521
NOT A FREUDIAN SLIP. WHY I

01:36:33.587 --> 01:36:34.655
AGREE WITH YOU ON THE ON THE

01:36:34.722 --> 01:36:36.457

THERE'S NO EXPENDITURE PLAN FOR

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:30.918
THESE FUNDS IN THIS IS BECAUSE-

01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:32.052
THE STATE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW

01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:33.487
WHAT KINDS. WILL RECEIVE FROM

AND CERTAINLY THAT'S WHY

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:53.774
POSSIBILITY. SO TIED TO IT'S

01:41:53.841 --> 01:41:54.308
CLEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:54.908
SHOULD HAVE A FORMAL ROLE IN

01:41:54.975 --> 01:42:02.082

01:42:15.562 --> 01:42:18.398
LIMIT THE USE OF FUNDS OR- THEY

01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:19.800
AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT COULD BE

01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:20.801
AND IT COULD GO THROUGH THIS

SO THIS PROPOSED LANGUAGE IS

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:22.582
VERY SIMILAR TO THE LANGUAGE

BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WAS-

01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:29.623
APPROPRIATE BY THE LEGISLATURE

01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:30.724
RIGHT BEFORE LEGISLATURE IS

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:33.727
ABOUT TWO OUT OF SESSION- FOR

THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING. I'M SO

01:45:36.163 --> 01:45:37.664
THERE IS A STRONG REASON FOR

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:38.999
DOING AT THAT POINT GIVEN THE

01:45:39.066 --> 01:45:39.633

KNOW THAT THE SECTION THIRTY

01:45:42.936 --> 01:45:43.603
SIX PROCESS HAS BEEN

01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:44.871
CHALLENGING FOR THE LEGISLATIVE

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:46.873
OVERSIGHT PERSPECTIVE- BUT THE

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:47.941
LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:50.343
REVIEW THOSE NOTICES. ANALYSIS

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:51.311
IN HIS IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO

01:45:51.378 --> 01:45:52.879
GET- THE INFORMATION

LEGISLATURE HAS REQUESTED.

01:45:54.514 --> 01:45:56.316

01:45:56.383 --> 01:45:57.417
THAT ARE IN YOUR STANDING IS

01:45:57.484 --> 01:45:58.218
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:45:58.285 --> 01:45:59.686
PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL THREE

01:45:59.753 --> 01:46:01.054
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:02.122
THAT WOULD BE EYOND THIS TO

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:03.924
CREATE NINE BILLION THAT WOULD

01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:07.527
BE GOVERNED. BY THE CONTROL

01:46:07.594 --> 01:46:09.229
SECTION. LEADS DIRECT KOBE

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:10.163
NINETEEN RELATED X. I'M AND

01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:11.164
THAT WOULD BOTH CURRENT. AS

01:46:11.231 --> 01:46:13.767
WELL AS THE- YOU'RE- I YET

01:46:13.834 --> 01:46:15.268
RECEIVED INFORMATION ON HOW

01:46:15.335 --> 01:46:16.269
THIS THESE FUNDS WOULD BE

01:46:16.336 --> 01:46:18.605
SPENT- AND FOR EXAMPLE WHICH

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:19.740
DEPARTMENTS WOULD RECEIVE THEM

01:46:19.806 --> 01:46:21.308
FOR WHAT PURPOSE- AND IT

01:46:21.374 --> 01:46:22.576
DOESN'T APPEAR TO US THAT THE

01:46:22.642 --> 01:46:23.677
SPENDING WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

01:46:23.744 --> 01:46:25.011
ANY KIND OF CONTROL SECTION OR

01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:27.547
OTHER PROCESS- OR- REQUIRE ANY

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:27.981
KIND OF LEGISLATIVE

01:46:28.048 --> 01:46:29.683
NOTIFICATION. I'M AT LEAST AT

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:30.751
THIS POINT THAT'S OUR

01:46:30.817 --> 01:46:33.453
UNDERSTANDING- SO THIS IS ALSO

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:34.821
REALLY A PARTICULAR NO BECAUSE

01:46:34.888 --> 01:46:37.357
IT'S EVEN LAST- LAST KIND OF

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:38.759
CONTROL THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:46:38.825 --> 01:46:40.460
HAS OVER THIS FINDING. THAT

01:46:40.527 --> 01:46:43.764
PENDING IS CURRENTLY ON

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:45.098
INCLUDED IN NINETEEN OH ONE.

01:46:45.165 --> 01:46:47.000
BUDGET ITEM. SO WE STERN THINK

01:46:47.067 --> 01:46:47.868
ALL OF THE FUNDING THAT'S BEING

01:46:47.934 --> 01:46:50.203
PROPOSED SHOULD- BE SUBJECT

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:51.805
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. ON

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:53.907
LEGISLATIVE CONTROL- AND SO

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:55.575
PART OF THAT CERTAINLY THAT

01:46:55.642 --> 01:46:56.610
ADDITIONAL FUNDING SHOULD GO

01:46:56.676 --> 01:46:57.878
THROUGH A PROCESS THAT THE

01:46:57.944 --> 01:46:58.945
LEGISLATURE COMFORTABLE WITH

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:00.714
AND ALSO WE THINK THAT. I'M

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:03.283
EVEN THE DEAFENING THAT'S BEING

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:04.417
PROPOSED FOR BACK. CONTROL

01:47:04.484 --> 01:47:06.186
SECTION THIRTY SIX THAT THAT

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:08.255
PROCESS COULD BE ENHANCED IN A

01:47:08.321 --> 01:47:09.689
MORE ROBUST TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:11.758
LEGISLATURE. HAS AN APPROPRIATE

01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:13.760
OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:15.495
USE OF THOSE FUNDS. AND AGAIN

01:47:15.562 --> 01:47:16.730
THEY'RE PROBABLY MULTIPLE

01:47:16.797 --> 01:47:18.098
DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPTIONS THE

01:47:18.165 --> 01:47:20.267
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER- IT

01:47:20.333 --> 01:47:22.769
COULD FOR EXAMPLE AGAIN SIMILAR

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:24.070
TO WHAT WE HAVE MENTIONED

01:47:24.137 --> 01:47:25.272
PREVIOUSLY SET DIFFERENT

01:47:25.338 --> 01:47:26.239
NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

01:47:26.306 --> 01:47:27.707
DEPENDING. ON WHETHER THE

01:47:27.774 --> 01:47:29.309
LEGISLATURE IS IN SESSION IT

01:47:29.376 --> 01:47:30.677
COULD REQUIRE LEGISLATION

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:32.846
LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL PRIOR TO

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:35.248
YOU- FUNDS BEING MADE

01:47:35.315 --> 01:47:36.349

REQUIRE CERTAIN THINGS BEING

01:47:37.984 --> 01:47:39.152
MADE AVAILABLE WHEN THAT

01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:41.621
NOTIFICATION. I'M IS MADE I'M

01:47:41.688 --> 01:47:43.356
ALSO AND DIFFERENT THE COULD BE

01:47:43.423 --> 01:47:44.958
RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPES OF

01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:47.127
USED TO FIND- OR THERE COULD BE

01:47:47.194 --> 01:47:47.727
ADDITIONAL REPORTING

01:47:47.794 --> 01:47:49.196
REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THOSE

01:47:49.262 --> 01:47:50.730
AFTER THE FACT SO THAT THE

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:51.698
LEGISLATURE CAN KEEP TRACK OF

01:47:51.765 --> 01:47:57.838
HOW. MANY HAS BEEN USED. VERY

01:47:57.904 --> 01:48:01.341
GOOD. TWENTY CENTER NIELSEN.

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:03.210
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT TO

01:48:03.276 --> 01:48:05.278
OUR ATTENTION AS TO A CURRENT

01:48:05.345 --> 01:48:09.516
AND LOOMING ISSUE BEFORE US.

01:48:09.583 --> 01:48:10.317
AND KIND OF THE PROOF IN THE

01:48:10.383 --> 01:48:13.286
PUDDING I THINK IS ONE EIGHTY

01:48:13.353 --> 01:48:15.422
NINE WAS PASSED THE IT DID A

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:17.123
CORD A LOT OF AUTHORITY. AND

01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:20.861
THEN A MAJOR- MAJOR

01:48:20.927 --> 01:48:23.430
EXPENDITURES WERE THEN. FOR

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:27.400
MASKS. AND MANY OF US WERE

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:29.369
REQUESTING INFORMATION ABOUT

01:48:29.436 --> 01:48:32.873
THE CONTRACTS. IN FACT I HAVE A

01:48:32.939 --> 01:48:35.575
PENDING THE- REQUEST WILL JOINT

01:48:35.642 --> 01:48:37.377
LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE TO

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:40.547
AUDIT THE CONTRACT. NOW I'M

01:48:40.614 --> 01:48:42.215
WAITING MY WAY THROUGH IT

01:48:42.282 --> 01:48:45.452
MYSELF THE I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY-

01:48:45.518 --> 01:48:47.020
BUT I'M ACTUALLY FAVORABLY

01:48:47.087 --> 01:48:48.889
DISPOSED TO THE DIRECTION I'M

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:51.892
SEEING THAT IT WAS NEGOTIATED.

01:48:51.958 --> 01:48:53.994
BUT BUT HERE'S THE POINT. THIS

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:56.630
IS IN THE BILLIONS THAT WE'RE

01:48:56.696 --> 01:48:59.065
AUTHORIZED THE EXPENDITURE OF

01:48:59.132 --> 01:49:01.234
IT BUT THAT WE THE LEGISLATORS

01:49:01.301 --> 01:49:03.670
HAVE NO CONTROL OVER. AND

01:49:03.737 --> 01:49:06.506
THAT'S GOING TO WAY TOO FAR SO

01:49:06.573 --> 01:49:08.742
WITH A AND I HAVE NO. QUESTION

01:49:08.808 --> 01:49:10.977
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CANNOT

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:13.513
COME TO TERMS WITH OUR CONCERNS

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.515
ABOUT BEING INFORMED AND EVEN

01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:23.356
SIGNIFICANT MOMENT. IN A

01:49:23.423 --> 01:49:25.358
SEVERAL YEAR EVOLUTION. OF

01:50:19.079 --> 01:50:21.848
OF MONEY THAT'S INVOLVED- IF

01:50:21.915 --> 01:50:23.183
YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER IS THAT

01:50:23.249 --> 01:50:24.451
IS THAT CORRECT THAT IT WOULD

01:50:24.517 --> 01:50:26.486
BE APPROXIMATELY SIX OR SEVEN

01:50:26.553 --> 01:50:29.589

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:40.100
YOU ALL ARE VERY WELL AWARE-

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:41.901
THE EXPENDITURES WHEN

EXPENDITURES ARE NEEDED AND

01:50:43.203 --> 01:50:47.107
RAN. AND CONTINUES TO BE

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:49.042
REFINED AND WE ARE ALSO AS PART

01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:50.477
OF THAT REALLY TRYING TO TRACK

01:50:50.543 --> 01:50:53.179
WHAT AND THAT'S GENERAL FUND

01:50:53.246 --> 01:50:54.381
IMPACTS AREN'T WHEN WE'RE

01:50:54.447 --> 01:50:55.448
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT POTENTIAL

01:50:55.515 --> 01:50:56.750
REIMBURSEMENT AS WELL AS THE

01:50:56.816 --> 01:50:57.717
POTENTIAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT

01:50:57.784 --> 01:51:00.020
WERE DISCUSSED EARLIER ITEMS

01:51:00.086 --> 01:51:02.022
AGAIN CONTINUING TO DO THAT AND

01:51:02.088 --> 01:51:03.356
CONTINUING TO. PROVIDE

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:05.225
INFORMATION ON WHAT THAT MEANS

01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:06.760
FOR THE GENERAL FUND AS WE MAKE

01:51:06.826 --> 01:51:08.795
BUDGETARY DECISIONS I THINK IT

01:51:08.862 --> 01:51:10.930
WOULD BE HELPFUL IS THAT- WHILE

01:51:10.997 --> 01:51:13.233
WE RECOGNIZE IT THAT- WE'RE

01:51:13.299 --> 01:51:14.768
WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THE

01:51:14.834 --> 01:51:15.301
GENERAL FUND RIGHT NOW THE

01:51:15.368 --> 01:51:18.505
pIMPORTANT EVEN IF WE GET

01:51:18.571 --> 01:51:20.240
REIMBURSED I THINK WE NEED TO

01:51:20.306 --> 01:51:22.175
KNOW WHAT WE'VE EXPANDED AND

01:51:22.242 --> 01:51:24.444
THEN HOW MUCH OF THAT WE'VE

01:51:24.511 --> 01:51:26.913
GOTTEN REIMBURSED AND- AND HOW

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.581
MUCH IS LEFT AND I'M NOT SURE

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:29.716
THAT ANY OF US HAVE A REALLY

01:51:29.783 --> 01:51:31.951
GOOD GRASP ON ANY OF THAT. SO

01:51:32.018 --> 01:51:34.521
ON THE MORE MORE DISCUSSION ON

01:51:34.587 --> 01:51:38.825
THAT YEAH HI SENATOR NIELSEN.

01:51:38.892 --> 01:51:39.659
IF I HAVE A- FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:51:39.726 --> 01:51:42.896
MATTER BECAUSE A- GIFT TO. THE

01:51:42.962 --> 01:51:44.064
MUEZZIN MEMORY OF MY SHALL I

01:51:44.130 --> 01:51:46.900
SAY.DURING THE PREVIOUS

01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:48.868
ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATION WAS

01:51:48.935 --> 01:51:50.970
PASSED ALLOWING A GOVERNOR TO

01:51:51.037 --> 01:51:53.373
DECLARE A DROUGHT EMERGENCY NOW

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.675
THAT WAS ALSO OF. AN EMERGENCY

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:57.977
OF GREAT MAGNITUDE. BUT MY

01:51:58.044 --> 01:52:01.414
FIRST READING OF THE BILL

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:03.483
INDICATED TO ME THERE WAS NO.

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:05.251
SEC TIME THAT THIS EMERGENCY

01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:08.755
WAS NOT IN EXISTENCE ANYMORE. I

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:10.623
DOUBT THAT THIS LAST

01:52:10.690 --> 01:52:13.026
DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY IS.

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:15.228
NOT STILL IN EFFECT RATHER THAN

01:52:15.295 --> 01:52:16.663
IT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

01:52:16.729 --> 01:52:19.099
TERMINATION TIME. AND MY

01:52:19.165 --> 01:52:20.767
READING OF EIGHTY NINE AND

01:52:20.834 --> 01:52:22.335
WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THAT I

01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:22.869
DON'T THINK THERE IS THERE

01:52:22.936 --> 01:52:25.405
EITHER. SO I THINK MY POINT IS

01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:26.339
WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:29.509

WE NEED TO KNOW- THINK WE NEED

01:52:53.733 --> 01:52:55.602
A LITTLE BIT MORE ACCOUNTING

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:57.670
AND- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN AGO

01:52:57.737 --> 01:53:00.006
SHE XIN ISSUES- SO THAT WE CAN

01:53:00.073 --> 01:53:01.741
FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO HANDLE

01:53:01.808 --> 01:53:02.709

RECOMMENDATION THAT THIS BE

MOVED TO A POLICY COMMITTEE WE

01:59:06.572 --> 01:59:07.707

01:59:07.773 --> 01:59:08.875
COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT IS A

01:59:08.941 --> 01:59:10.376
SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT OF

PERSONNEL AND DOLLARS FOR THIS

01:59:13.145 --> 01:59:16.015
PROJECT AND ALSO- WITH ALL

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:18.217
STATE WOULD DELAY THE

01:59:18.284 --> 01:59:19.452
IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE ALL SICK

01:59:19.519 --> 01:59:21.988
MANY COME BACK HERE WITH EASY

01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:23.489
THING AND THEN HIRING STAFF AND

01:59:23.556 --> 01:59:25.324
WRAPPING UP THE PROGRAM AND ITS

01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:31.797
MISSION I JUST MENTIONED. TO

01:59:31.864 --> 01:59:36.102
START. SUPER THE WORK. BOB

01:59:36.168 --> 01:59:39.105
KELLY ON. THANK YOU CHAIR ASKED

01:59:39.171 --> 01:59:40.306
WE RECOMMEND AS YOU HEARD FROM

01:59:40.373 --> 01:59:42.775
FINANCE- THAT THIS PROPOSAL BE

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:44.277
HEARD THAT THE POLICY PROCESS

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:45.811
RECOMMENDED APPROACH BOTH

01:59:45.878 --> 01:59:46.913
BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:59:46.979 --> 01:59:48.848
REALLY KEY POLICY QUESTIONS

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:50.182
THAT ARE INVOLVED THIS IS- THE

01:59:50.249 --> 01:59:51.484
SIGNIFICANT KIND OF CHANGE FOR

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:53.986
THE DEPARTMENT AND WE THINK

01:59:54.053 --> 01:59:54.887
THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME IN

01:59:54.954 --> 01:59:56.756
THIS PARTICULARLY- IN THERE'S

01:59:56.822 --> 01:59:59.258
ALWAYS A COMPRESSED TIMEFRAME-

01:59:59.325 --> 02:00:00.760
THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT

02:00:00.826 --> 02:00:02.929
PARTICULARLY THIS YEAR AS AS

02:00:02.995 --> 02:00:04.664
YOU ALL KNOW THERE'S A VERY

02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:06.933
COMPRESSED TIME. PROJECT HAND.

02:00:06.999 --> 02:00:08.834
PROCESS I'M SO WE THINK AFTER

02:00:08.901 --> 02:00:10.303
THOSE POLICY DECISIONS ARE MADE

02:00:10.369 --> 02:00:11.771
IT WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE

02:00:11.837 --> 02:00:13.306
THEN TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF

02:00:13.372 --> 02:00:14.941
FINDING THAT COMMENSURATE WITH

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:16.542
WHATEVER THOSE CHANGES ARE. SO

02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:17.710
THAT MIGHT NEED ADJUSTING THE

02:00:17.777 --> 02:00:19.045
LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT'S BEING

02:00:19.111 --> 02:00:19.912
PROPOSED CURRENTLY IF THE

02:00:19.979 --> 02:00:20.880
LEGISLATURE TAKES A SLIGHTLY

02:00:20.947 --> 02:00:22.982
DIFFERENT OPTIONS BEING UP. AND

02:00:23.049 --> 02:00:24.550
PROPOSE CURRENTLY BY THE

02:00:24.617 --> 02:00:25.851
ADMINISTRATION. SO WE THINK

02:00:25.918 --> 02:00:28.020
THAT- REALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:00:28.087 --> 02:00:29.922
GET IT RIGHT I'M IN SO DOING IT

02:00:29.989 --> 02:00:31.724
TO THAT PROCESS ONE WILL HELP

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:32.925
ENSURE THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND

02:00:32.992 --> 02:00:33.793
HELP ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT

02:00:33.859 --> 02:00:36.162
FUNDING LEVEL. IS ALSO PROVIDED

02:00:36.228 --> 02:00:37.496
I'M AND OF COURSE THERE'S

02:00:37.563 --> 02:00:39.031
ALWAYS- YOU KNOW OPTIONS FOR

02:00:39.098 --> 02:00:41.400
EXAMPLE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR. IF

02:00:41.467 --> 02:00:43.769
FUNDING IS TO BE EXPEDITED. THE

02:00:43.836 --> 02:00:44.670
KIND OF THINGS THAT COULD BE

02:00:44.737 --> 02:00:45.972
CONSIDERED A LEGISLATURE

02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:47.840
INTERESTED IN DOING THAT. ALSO

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:49.108
WE JUST KNOW THAT TO THE EXTENT

02:00:49.175 --> 02:00:50.843
THAT FUNDING IS PROVIDED IN THE

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:52.445
BUDGET YEAR WE HAVE WE DO

02:00:52.511 --> 02:00:54.513
RECOMMEND SOME TWEAKS. I'M ONE

02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:55.781
OF THEM IS THAT WE THINK THAT

02:00:55.848 --> 02:00:56.983
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REJECT

02:00:57.049 --> 02:00:58.818
FUNDING FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE

02:00:58.884 --> 02:01:00.553
NOT NEEDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:02.254
SO. THIS FAR AS FINDING A

02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:04.323
PROPOSAL NOT ONLY REQUIRED

02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:06.659
REQUEST FUNDING FOR POSITIONS

02:01:06.726 --> 02:01:08.094
THAT ARE NEEDED STARTING IN

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:08.995
TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT

02:01:09.061 --> 02:01:11.230
ALSO SOME POSITIONS THAT DON'T-

02:01:11.297 --> 02:01:13.199
DON'T START INTEL FUTURE YEARS

02:01:13.265 --> 02:01:14.667
SO MAYBE THEY'RE NOT NEEDED

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:16.636
UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY

02:01:16.702 --> 02:01:18.270
TWO. AND SO WE THINK THAT

02:01:18.337 --> 02:01:19.739
POINT. THE LEGISLATURE CAN

02:01:19.805 --> 02:01:21.607
EVALUATE WHAT NEEDS ARE OF THE

02:01:21.674 --> 02:01:23.242
PROGRAM THERE'S A LOT OF

02:01:23.309 --> 02:01:24.176
UNCERTAINTY GIVEN THAT ITS NEW

02:01:24.243 --> 02:01:26.012
PROGRAM SO. JUST JUST FINDING

02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:27.680
THE ONES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED-

02:01:27.747 --> 02:01:29.181
AND THAT AND EIGHT YEAR IF YOU

02:01:29.248 --> 02:01:30.983
WERE TO TAKE THAT APPROACH. AND

02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:32.118
ALSO THAT SOME TYPES OF

02:01:32.184 --> 02:01:33.653
ACTIVITY SHOULD BE FUNDED. ON A

02:01:33.719 --> 02:01:36.889
LIMITED TERM PILOT BASIS SO AT

02:01:36.956 --> 02:01:38.124
AS WAS MENTIONED THERE ARE SOME

02:01:38.190 --> 02:01:39.992
NEW FOR EXAMPLE YOU ON. YOUR

02:02:20.466 --> 02:02:26.072
YEARS. OF SEATING POLICY OF

THOSE FEES WERE IMPOSED ON.

02:03:02.408 --> 02:03:04.076
THAT IS A VERY COMMON PRACTICE

02:03:04.143 --> 02:03:06.178
NOW AND AS WE APPROACH APPROACH

02:03:06.245 --> 02:03:08.314
THIS PARTICULAR AREA I THINK WE

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.149

OF THE PUBLIC IS REALLY

02:03:30.703 --> 02:03:33.839
IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHEN THE.

OF THE DEPARTMENT IS TO DO IT

02:03:54.426 --> 02:03:55.728

WE TALKING ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO

02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:15.748
BE AFFECTED. WHAT WHAT ARE THE-

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:17.550
WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE

02:04:17.616 --> 02:04:19.285
EXPANSION OF THE DEPARTMENT

02:04:19.351 --> 02:04:23.122
THIS IS FAIRLY EXTENSIVE- IT'S-

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:25.457
IT IS ABOUT WALKING INTO AN

02:04:25.524 --> 02:04:28.260
AREA THAT HAS- SOME ISSUES THAT

02:04:28.327 --> 02:04:29.461
I THINK MANY OF US WANT TO

02:04:29.528 --> 02:04:30.696
UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER

02:04:30.763 --> 02:04:32.398
EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD WORK- I

02:04:32.464 --> 02:04:37.203
ALSO. I HAVE- IT RECEIVE SOME

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:40.439
CONCERN IN REGARDS TO. THE

02:04:40.506 --> 02:04:42.708
LANGUAGE AND IT THIS IS ONE OF

02:04:42.775 --> 02:04:44.210
THE REASONS WHY. IN DOING A

02:04:44.276 --> 02:04:46.078
BILL- DURING THE REORGANIZATION

02:04:46.145 --> 02:04:47.446
PROCESS IS REAL IMPORTANT WHEN

02:04:47.513 --> 02:04:49.281
YOU SEE IT IN WRITING AND YOU

02:04:49.348 --> 02:04:50.616
HAVE A CHANCE TO RESPOND BUT-

02:04:50.683 --> 02:04:53.285
IN PARTICULAR SB TWELVE THIRTY

02:04:53.352 --> 02:04:56.088
FIVE THAT WAS PASSED A- THE-

02:04:56.155 --> 02:04:59.191
LAST TWO YEARS AGO- IN IT'S THE

02:04:59.258 --> 02:05:00.826
TRUTH IN FINANCING WHICH HAS

02:05:00.893 --> 02:05:02.261
PROTECTIONS FOR SMALL

02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:05.364
BUSINESSES. AND THE TRAILER

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:08.100
BILL- CHANGES SOME OF THE

02:05:08.167 --> 02:05:11.437
LANGUAGE AND- AND IT

02:05:11.503 --> 02:05:13.572
FUNDAMENTALLY HANGES THE

02:05:13.639 --> 02:05:15.074
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:17.543
BECAUSE IT IT CHECK IT USES NEW

02:05:17.610 --> 02:05:22.514
DEFINITIONS AND- AND IT IT THAT.

02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:24.250
THE IT THE BILL AS IT WAS

02:05:24.316 --> 02:05:26.785
PASSED ALLOWS ROLL MAKING

02:05:26.852 --> 02:05:31.457
SIMILAR TO THE DODD FRANK- AB

02:05:31.523 --> 02:05:35.194
FEDERAL LEGISLATION SO- SO PART

02:05:35.261 --> 02:05:36.262
OF THE CHALLENGES MAKING SURE

02:05:36.328 --> 02:05:39.531
THAT. THAT WHATEVER LANGUAGE

02:05:39.598 --> 02:05:42.034
THAT IS ADOPTED REALLY FITS IN

02:05:42.101 --> 02:05:43.202
WITH THINGS THAT THE

02:05:43.269 --> 02:05:43.802
LEGISLATURE HAS SUPPORTED IN

02:05:43.869 --> 02:05:46.906
THE PAST SO HAVING SAID THAT

02:05:46.972 --> 02:05:48.407
THIS IS ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT.

02:05:48.474 --> 02:05:49.675
IT IS RECOMMENDED TO BE WHOLE

02:05:49.742 --> 02:05:51.510
HELD OPEN I THINK THERE'S MORE

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:52.845
DISCUSSION ON THIS IT MAY BE

02:05:52.912 --> 02:05:56.615
THAT. THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A

02:05:56.682 --> 02:05:57.816
WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET TO YES

02:05:57.883 --> 02:06:00.052
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION-

02:06:00.119 --> 02:06:01.220
APPRECIATE THE CAN CAN

02:06:01.287 --> 02:06:03.422
APPRECIATE AND THAT ALLOWS THE

02:06:03.489 --> 02:06:04.823
LEGISLATURE TO KNOW EXACTLY

02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:07.359
WHERE WE'RE CBO. IS GOING TO GO

02:06:07.426 --> 02:06:09.428
ON THIS BUT- I REALLY FEEL

02:06:09.495 --> 02:06:11.830
STRONGLY THAT- THAT IT'S VERY

02:06:11.897 --> 02:06:14.033
DIFFICULT TO DO A

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:14.967

MODEST IN. AND SMALL. AS WE

02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:21.540

02:06:21.607 --> 02:06:23.108
ASK QUESTIONS SO THAT WILL

02:06:23.175 --> 02:06:24.843
REMAIN OPEN AND I'M SURE WILL

RECOMMEND. CRISIS FLEXIBILITY-

02:17:58.370 --> 02:17:59.838
IDEALLY THIS WOULD MEAN

02:17:59.904 --> 02:18:01.773
DEPOSITING THE REVENUE. IN THE

02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:03.508

DIFFERENCE IN THE OVERALL

02:18:16.588 --> 02:18:17.989
STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET.

02:18:18.056 --> 02:18:19.324

THAT THE MORE THAT WE CAN-

02:18:54.059 --> 02:18:56.528
REDUCE THE USE AND PART OF THE

02:18:56.594 --> 02:18:58.163
WAY YOU DO THAT IS BY

02:18:58.229 --> 02:19:00.165
IMPLEMENTING A TAX ON IT WE

02:19:00.231 --> 02:19:00.865
HAVE A TAX ON CIGARETTES I

02:19:00.932 --> 02:19:02.434
THINK WE SHOULD DO IT. FOR THIS

02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:04.769
AS WELL HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL

02:19:04.836 --> 02:19:07.572
BECAUSE IT IS A ACTUALLY IT

02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:08.740
WHETHER IT'S IN THE BUDGET OR

02:19:08.807 --> 02:19:10.375
NOT THERE'D STILL BE A

02:19:10.442 --> 02:19:13.311
CONTROVERSY IT'S- IT'S OVER THE

02:19:13.378 --> 02:19:15.246
DETAILS AND I'VE TALKED WITH

02:19:15.313 --> 02:19:16.548
THE NUMBER OF THE STAKEHOLDERS

02:19:16.614 --> 02:19:17.749
AND I THINK THERE'S A SWEET

02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:22.420
SPOT TO GET THERE BUT THE- THE

02:19:22.487 --> 02:19:24.456
THAT. THE WHOLE DISCUSSION

02:19:24.522 --> 02:19:26.524
ABOUT POINT OF SALE VERSUS THE

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:28.960
DISTRIBUTOR AND THEN THIS THE

02:19:29.027 --> 02:19:31.629
SPECIAL FIND. I HAS GIVE ME

02:19:31.696 --> 02:19:32.931
SOME HEARTBURN I THINK IT

02:19:32.997 --> 02:19:34.499
SHOULD GO IN THE REVENUE SHOULD

02:19:34.566 --> 02:19:35.533
GO INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND WE

02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:37.569
SUPPORT. YOUTH HEALTH FUN

02:19:37.635 --> 02:19:39.838
ACTIVITIES IF YOU KNOW BECAUSE

02:19:39.904 --> 02:19:42.774
THAT IS A PRIORITY- BUT WE ALSO

02:19:42.841 --> 02:19:45.176
WE ALSO FIND FIRST FIVE THROUGH

02:19:45.243 --> 02:19:47.145
OUR CIGARETTE TAX AND SO IF

02:19:47.212 --> 02:19:48.213
WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT INTO A

02:19:48.279 --> 02:19:50.081
SPECIAL FUND PART OF THE MONEY

02:19:50.148 --> 02:19:51.182
SHOULD GO IN THE FIRST FIVE

02:19:51.249 --> 02:19:52.584
BECAUSE THAT'S- THAT'S SEEN

02:19:52.650 --> 02:19:54.085
DECLINING REVENUES BECAUSE OF

02:19:54.152 --> 02:19:56.988
THE- OF THE SHIFT. TO OTHER

02:19:57.055 --> 02:19:59.691
SUBSTANTIVE SUBSTANCES BUT I DO

02:19:59.758 --> 02:20:04.062
THINK THERE IS. THERE THERE IS-

02:20:04.129 --> 02:20:05.864
EIGHTY AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE

02:20:05.930 --> 02:20:06.998
SOME CONSISTENCY WITH THE

02:20:07.065 --> 02:20:10.568
CIGARETTE TAX. AND TO DO IT IN

02:20:10.635 --> 02:20:12.637
A WAY THAT THAT IS NOT- A HUGE

02:20:12.704 --> 02:20:16.641
BURDEN ON- EITHER. THE

02:20:16.708 --> 02:20:19.010
DISTRIBUTORS OR THAT THE RETAIL

02:20:19.077 --> 02:20:21.045
OUTLETS- A LOT OF THESE ARE

02:20:21.112 --> 02:20:23.314
SOLD AT THE- MOMENT POP STORES

02:20:23.381 --> 02:20:24.916
AND SO TO MAKE THEM RESPONSIBLE

02:20:24.983 --> 02:20:26.084
FOR SOME OF THIS DOESN'T SEEM

02:20:26.151 --> 02:20:27.352
TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE SO. THIS

02:20:27.418 --> 02:20:28.953
IS A HOLD OPEN I WOULD ITEM IF

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:30.855
THERE'S NO OTHER A COMMENT-

02:20:30.922 --> 02:20:33.091
WITH WITH THAT- I WOULD JUST

02:20:33.158 --> 02:20:34.859
SAY THAT THERE IS INTERESTED

02:20:34.926 --> 02:20:36.194
INTEREST IN SITTING DOWN AND-

02:20:36.261 --> 02:20:37.729
AMONG THE INDUSTRY SITTING DOWN

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:38.730

THAT HAPPEN IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

02:20:42.133 --> 02:20:46.104

THROUGH A TWO MEANS SO THE

02:21:34.185 --> 02:21:36.988
FIRST APPROACH IS TO SUSPEND

ARE MUCH SMALLER BUT STILL

02:24:32.797 --> 02:24:35.400
SIGNIFICANT. THE PROVISION OF

02:24:35.466 --> 02:24:36.801
THIS PROVISION WOULD LIMIT

02:24:36.868 --> 02:24:38.336
CREDIT USAGE TO FIVE MILLION

02:24:38.403 --> 02:24:40.138
PER YEAR. STRUCTURED AS A

02:24:40.204 --> 02:24:41.839
DOLLAR LIMIT HOWEVER IT WOULD

02:24:41.906 --> 02:24:44.042

PERSONAL GESTURE CRITICS SAY HE

02:25:00.291 --> 02:25:02.126
ID SO THAT'S- FINALLY TO THE

02:25:02.193 --> 02:25:04.162
EXTENT THAT ANY CREDIT AFFECTED

02:25:04.228 --> 02:25:06.197

YEARS THAT THE CREDIT LIMIT IT.

02:25:15.106 --> 02:25:17.075
AS SUCH AS IT IS EXPECTED TO BE

02:25:17.141 --> 02:25:18.576
UP THAT MUCH OF THE CREDITS

WILL EVENTUALLY BE USED AND SO

02:25:22.547 --> 02:25:24.115
JUST SAID IN SOME I WOULD SAY

02:25:24.182 --> 02:25:26.084
THIS IS A- PROPOSAL THAT RAISES

02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:28.686
A LOT OF MONEY. BUT BECAUSE WE

02:25:28.753 --> 02:25:30.555
REALLY SEE THAT THIS RECESSION

02:25:30.621 --> 02:25:32.757

02:25:32.824 --> 02:25:35.059

02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:43.828
PACKAGE OF ACTIONS TO ADDRESS

02:26:43.895 --> 02:26:46.230
THE BUDGET SHORTFALL WE THINK

02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:47.431
THAT THE PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD

02:26:47.498 --> 02:26:48.966
THESE PROPOSALS BEFORE BY THE

02:26:49.033 --> 02:26:50.334
ADMINISTRATION ARE REASONABLE

02:26:50.401 --> 02:26:51.736
STARTING POINT YOUR

02:26:51.802 --> 02:26:54.639
DELIBERATIONS OF THE STATE HAS

02:26:54.705 --> 02:26:55.306
TAKEN SOME MORE I. AFTER

02:26:55.373 --> 02:26:57.775
SESSIONS- AND ARE GENERALLY

02:26:57.842 --> 02:26:59.544
CONSIDERED IS LESS BURDENSOME

02:26:59.610 --> 02:27:00.778
BECAUSE THEY'RE LARGELY

02:27:00.845 --> 02:27:02.446
ACCELERATE THE TIMING AND TAX

02:27:02.513 --> 02:27:04.382
PAYMENTS. ARE WITHOUT GREATLY

02:27:04.448 --> 02:27:06.417
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF TAXES.

02:27:06.484 --> 02:27:09.320
A OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

02:27:09.387 --> 02:27:10.188
THAT BEING SAID THE

02:27:10.254 --> 02:27:11.656
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL DOES

02:27:11.722 --> 02:27:13.858
HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS FIRST THE

02:27:13.925 --> 02:27:15.760
REVENUE THERE WOULD BE REYES

02:27:15.826 --> 02:27:17.428
FROM THESE ACTIONS ARE SUBJECT

02:27:17.495 --> 02:27:19.030
TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY SO

02:27:19.096 --> 02:27:20.831
BUILDING A BUDGET THE RELY ON A

02:27:20.898 --> 02:27:21.832
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REVENUE FROM

02:27:21.899 --> 02:27:23.301
THESE ACTIONS WOULD BE SOMEWHAT

02:27:23.367 --> 02:27:25.403
RISKY. FUNDING THIS CONCERN

02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:27.738
BASED ON OUR INITIAL REVIEW. WE

02:27:27.805 --> 02:27:28.406
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:27:28.472 --> 02:27:31.008
ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT REVENUE

02:27:31.075 --> 02:27:32.810
RAISED TO BE TOO HIGH. ANOTHER

02:27:32.877 --> 02:27:33.978
POTENTIAL IMITATION OF THE

02:27:34.045 --> 02:27:35.213
PROPOSAL IS THAT IT WOULD

02:27:35.279 --> 02:27:36.881
ATTEMPT TO- LIMIT KNOLL

02:27:36.948 --> 02:27:38.482
SUSPENSIONS MEDIUM AND LARGE

02:27:38.549 --> 02:27:39.984
BUSINESSES BASED ON INCOME

02:27:40.051 --> 02:27:41.285
THRESHOLD BUT IT'S MY CALLING

02:27:41.352 --> 02:27:44.689
FROM THE FINANCES DESCRIBE

02:27:44.755 --> 02:27:46.424
USING AN INCOME THRESHOLD. I

02:27:46.490 --> 02:27:47.658
WOULD BE THE PERFECT WAY OF

02:27:47.725 --> 02:27:48.826
DISTINGUISHING SMALLER

02:27:48.893 --> 02:27:51.229
BUSINESSES FROM LARGER ONES.

02:27:51.295 --> 02:27:52.597
AND WE ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERN

02:27:52.663 --> 02:27:53.631
THAT THIS APPROACH COULD LEAD

02:27:53.698 --> 02:27:55.600
TO SIMILAR BUSINESSES ARE BEING

02:27:55.666 --> 02:27:57.301
TREATED DIFFERENTLY UNDER THE

02:27:57.368 --> 02:27:59.203
PROPOSAL. ALTERNATIVE HE

02:27:59.270 --> 02:28:00.304
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

02:28:00.371 --> 02:28:02.206
CAPPING THE AMOUNT OF MOLD

02:28:02.273 --> 02:28:04.709
ADOPTIONS IT CAN BE USED IN A

02:28:04.775 --> 02:28:06.644
WAY THAT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT THE

02:28:06.711 --> 02:28:08.312
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES. ON TAX

02:28:08.379 --> 02:28:13.351

AND- AT THE I THINK THE KEY

02:28:28.499 --> 02:28:29.734
HERE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:32.737
ALTERNATIVES IF THE- DID THAT

02:28:32.803 --> 02:28:35.539

WASN'T. EXPECTED THAT THIS

02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:43.567
ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD REDUCE

02:35:43.634 --> 02:35:45.703

IDENTIFIED MANY FACTORS THAT

03:00:58.714 --> 03:01:00.182
ARE CHALLENGING AND CHARGE SO

03:01:00.249 --> 03:01:02.117

03:01:17.967 --> 03:01:20.135
REPRESENT ONGOING DEMAND AMONG

THE- IN THE FUTURE. THIS WOULD

03:01:23.272 --> 03:01:24.740
HAVE RESULTED IN A SMALLER

EXTRAORDINARILY SENSITIVE AREA.

MILITARY HISTORY. THE

TO THEM WE SORT OF ALL THEM

03:08:27.262 --> 03:08:30.399
THAT THAT HOME. THOUGH THAT HAS

03:08:30.465 --> 03:08:32.334
BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROJECT

03:08:32.401 --> 03:08:33.969
OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AND YEAH

03:08:34.036 --> 03:08:37.305
BILL. AS WITH ADVANCED THAN IN

03:08:37.372 --> 03:08:39.941
CALIFORNIA THERE'S BEEN A BOON

03:08:40.008 --> 03:08:42.244
TO MANY OTHER AREAS AND I DID

03:08:42.310 --> 03:08:44.046
REPRESENT THE SHASTA COUNTY SO

03:08:44.112 --> 03:08:46.581
THE I. GOING ON ALL A HOME IT'S

03:08:46.648 --> 03:08:48.483
BEEN A PART OF THE YEAR THAT I

03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:51.186
REPRESENTED. AND THE DYNAMIC IS

03:08:51.253 --> 03:08:53.155
NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUALS HOUSE

03:08:53.221 --> 03:08:55.223
THERE IN BUT IT'S OF FAMILIAL

03:08:55.290 --> 03:08:56.758
ASPECT OF IT AND THAT IS

03:08:56.825 --> 03:08:57.192
SOMETHING THAT IS A

03:08:57.259 --> 03:08:59.127
CONSIDERATION WITH ALL SUCH

03:08:59.194 --> 03:09:00.796
HEALTH FACILITIES BUT INDEED

03:09:00.862 --> 03:09:02.130
THAT IS THE CASE WITH THE

03:09:02.197 --> 03:09:04.499
VETERANS HOME. SO I WOULD ARGUE

03:09:04.566 --> 03:09:06.401
THAT THE- THIS WILL NOT A BE

03:09:06.468 --> 03:09:08.804
JUST PUT ON HOLD AND LET TO.

03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:10.372
LET'S LOOK AT IT OVER A PERIOD

03:09:10.439 --> 03:09:13.775
OF TIME AND CRAFT A PLAN. OF

03:09:13.842 --> 03:09:15.110
THE SHORT OF CLOSING THAT WOULD

03:09:15.177 --> 03:09:17.546
BE SURPRISING AS FAR AS

03:09:17.612 --> 03:09:18.814
BALANCING OUR BUDGET THIS IS

03:09:18.880 --> 03:09:21.583
NOT EVEN BUDGET DUST. SO I JUST

03:09:21.650 --> 03:09:22.851
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD TAKE IT

03:09:22.918 --> 03:09:24.486
SERIOUSLY AS TERMS OF A-

03:09:24.553 --> 03:09:25.921
FASHIONING AND OF BEING A AN

03:09:25.987 --> 03:09:26.988
INTEGRAL PART OF THIS

03:09:27.055 --> 03:09:29.024
PARTICULAR BUDGET SO YEAH BUT

03:09:29.091 --> 03:09:31.526
WE WERE LEAVING IT OPEN AND

03:09:31.593 --> 03:09:32.160
WILL. WILL CONSIDER. THANK YOU

VERY MUCH. BETTER DRUGS OF ANY

03:09:35.897 --> 03:09:39.468
COMMENTS ON THING MAN I AM YOU

03:09:39.534 --> 03:09:41.369
KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

03:09:41.436 --> 03:09:43.972
COMMENT THAT THERE'S NO SAVINGS

03:09:44.039 --> 03:09:46.808
TO BE MADE WHEN YOU'RE DOING-THIS KIND OF TRANSITION BECAUSE

03:09:46.875 --> 03:09:48.110
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP THE SERVICES

03:09:48.176 --> 03:09:50.812
GOING WHETHER THERE'S FIFTY OR

03:09:50.879 --> 03:09:52.981
A HUNDRED PEOPLE THERE AND SO-

03:09:53.048 --> 03:09:54.616
I JUST I WANNA MAKE SURE THIS

03:09:54.683 --> 03:09:58.153
IS DONE IN THE MOST- DELICATE.

03:09:58.220 --> 03:10:02.824
AND SENSITIVE WAY BECAUSE

03:10:02.891 --> 03:10:04.226
YOU'RE YOU'RE TRANSFORMING IN

03:10:04.292 --> 03:10:05.393
CHANGING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND

03:10:05.460 --> 03:10:06.795
MOVING THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND

03:10:06.862 --> 03:10:07.896
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:10:07.963 --> 03:10:09.998
WE'RE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT-

03:10:10.065 --> 03:10:11.166
INVOLVES OF FAMILY AND SO I

03:10:11.233 --> 03:10:13.769
THINK THAT THE IDEA OF HAVING A

03:10:13.835 --> 03:10:14.636
PLAN IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT

03:10:14.703 --> 03:10:20.475

03:10:20.542 --> 03:10:23.345
I KNOW IS IT VETERANS HOMES

03:10:23.411 --> 03:10:25.180
PLACEMENT TO HAVE LONG WAITING

03:10:25.247 --> 03:10:28.917
LISTS. TO ASSUME THAT THESE

03:10:28.984 --> 03:10:32.187
COULD ALL BE JUST FANNED OUT. I

03:10:32.254 --> 03:10:32.687
THINK IS AN UNREASONABLE

03:10:32.754 --> 03:10:35.223
EXPECTATION. BUT I THINK THE-

03:10:35.290 --> 03:10:36.691
THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO REJECT

03:10:36.758 --> 03:10:38.226

03:17:51.759 --> 03:17:53.995
CLOSE LOOK AT THIS. THIS

03:17:54.062 --> 03:17:57.432
PARTICULAR LEGISLATION AND WHAT

03:17:57.498 --> 03:17:59.100
IT WILL TAKE TO IMPLEMENT THAT

03:17:59.167 --> 03:18:00.702
LEGISLATION THE CONCERN TO ME

03:18:00.768 --> 03:18:02.637
IS THAT TO CERTAIN PEOPLE ADMIN

03:18:02.704 --> 03:18:04.272

03:18:05.173 --> 03:18:07.108
POSITIONS AND IT'S- GOING TO BE

03:18:07.175 --> 03:18:10.144
A- NOT MAY BE. CONFUSING BUT

03:18:10.211 --> 03:18:12.213
PERILOUS SO WE HAVE TO GO WITH

03:18:12.280 --> 03:18:15.483
CAUTION THAT'S MY RULE. THIRD

03:18:15.550 --> 03:18:17.485
DRAWS OF. IT SENATE BILL SO I

03:18:17.552 --> 03:18:18.987
THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD

03:18:19.053 --> 03:18:20.188
POINT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

03:18:20.255 --> 03:18:22.790
GOING TO BE. UP A HARD

03:18:22.857 --> 03:18:25.460
TRANSITION TO GO TO- FOR

03:18:25.526 --> 03:18:27.095
EMPLOYERS FOR OWNERS OF

03:18:27.161 --> 03:18:29.530
BUSINESSES FOR OFF FOR THE MEN

03:18:29.597 --> 03:18:31.299

03:18:31.366 --> 03:18:34.402
I'M I'M GLAD TO SEE. THAT WE'RE

03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:37.105
GONNA BE READY FOR IT- VERSUS

03:18:37.171 --> 03:18:40.208
JUST GET GETTING INUNDATED AND-

03:18:40.275 --> 03:18:42.577
ALREADY A LOT OF QUESTIONS SO I

03:18:42.644 --> 03:18:44.612
THINK. THIS FEELS LIKE WE'RE IN

03:18:44.679 --> 03:18:46.447
THE BUDGET BETTER POSITION MORE

03:18:46.514 --> 03:18:51.753
PREPARED TO HANDLE THE ISSUES.

03:18:51.819 --> 03:18:53.955
WELL THE CONCERN I HAVE WITH

03:18:54.022 --> 03:18:55.323
THIS PARTICULAR ITEM IS JUST

03:18:55.390 --> 03:18:56.591
THAT THE- LANDSCAPE IS

03:18:56.658 --> 03:18:58.426
CHANGING- THERE WAS A BILL

03:18:58.493 --> 03:19:03.097
HEARD I BELIEVE YESTERDAY THAT-

03:19:03.164 --> 03:19:06.234
READ SOME MORE EXEMPTIONS. AND

03:19:06.301 --> 03:19:07.802
WHETHER THAT GETS THROUGH THE

03:19:07.869 --> 03:19:10.605
LEGISLATURE NODDED IT'S A IT

03:19:10.672 --> 03:19:12.607
THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY AND

03:19:12.674 --> 03:19:13.608
THERE'S I THINK IT'S GOING TO

03:19:13.675 --> 03:19:14.642
TAKE A LITTLE WHILE FOR US TO

03:19:14.709 --> 03:19:17.745
GET THROUGH THIS AND SO- I AM I

03:19:17.812 --> 03:19:21.215
APPRECIATE THE I APPRECIATE YOU

03:19:21.282 --> 03:19:22.483
KNOW THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING

03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:25.720
IN. I SUPPORTED- BUT I THINK WE

03:19:25.787 --> 03:19:28.156
NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:19:28.222 --> 03:19:30.325
INFORMATION BEFORE WE ON.

03:19:30.391 --> 03:19:32.360
BEFORE WE START ACTING TO BEEF

03:19:32.427 --> 03:19:34.329
UP A DEPARTMENT- WE NEED TO

03:19:34.395 --> 03:19:35.563
KNOW WHAT WE'RE BEEFING IT FOR

03:19:35.630 --> 03:19:36.898
AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT

03:19:36.964 --> 03:19:40.368
SO- THIS IS A BY A HOLDOVER

03:19:40.435 --> 03:19:42.036
ITEM AND I DO APPRECIATE THE

03:19:42.103 --> 03:19:43.905
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THE

03:19:43.971 --> 03:19:45.239
DISCUSSION SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT

03:19:45.306 --> 03:19:46.974
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING. IN AS

03:19:47.041 --> 03:19:48.943
WE AS WE MOVE ON THIS IT'S

03:19:49.010 --> 03:19:49.844
CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF

03:19:49.911 --> 03:19:51.279
UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR IN THE

03:19:51.346 --> 03:19:53.214
COMMUNITY AND I WANT TO BE ABLE

GOING AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

03:19:55.783 --> 03:19:57.418
DO WITH IT SO HOLD OPEN I THINK

03:19:57.485 --> 03:20:00.922
