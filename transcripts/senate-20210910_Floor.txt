AND LATE AT NIGHT I GOT A CALL FROM MY CHIEF OF STAFF WHO HAD BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH MARK. NOT THAT MUCH LONGER- IT WHEN HE SAID TO ME AND HE WAS PROFOUNDLY SHAKEN. MY CHIEF OF STAFF WAS PROFOUNDLY SHAKEN. BECAUSE WHEN HE LEARNED OF MARK'S PASSING. YOU STOP YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE WORLD HAS TO STOP. FOR A MOMENT IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF THIS WORK THAT WE DO THIS IMPORTANT WORK THAT WE DO. BECAUSE AN% INCREDIBLE LIGHT AND INCREDIBLE PUBLIC SERVANT SOMEONE THAT HAD A LIFE AHEAD OF HIM TO DO SO MUCH MORE. WAS LOST.

HE HAD TO STOP THAT NIGHT AND HE LET ME KNOW- WHAT WAS ON HIS HEART AND HIS MIND AND I THINK WE'RE ALL FEELING THAT TODAY AND I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR MARK'S FAMILY. TO KNOW THAT THAT MARK HAD MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. IT'S INCREDIBLE FAMILY THIS HERE TODAY ALL OF ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT US SENATOR NEWMAN MENTIONED HIS WIFE HIS PARENTS HIS SIBLINGS HIS CHILDREN. ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE BUT YOU HAVE A FAMILY HERE TODAY THAT WANTS TO MAKE SURE IN THE MIDST OF AS WE- BRING TO CONCLUSION THE WORK THAT WE DO FOR THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA.

AND THE LAST TIME I TALKED TO MARK HE WAS VERY EXCITED BECAUSE SAM WAS HAVING HIS EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY PARTY IN BIG SUR ON JULY FOURTH AND HE WENT. AND HE HAD AN AMAZING TIME AND I HEARD FROM MANY PEOPLE THAT WERE AT THAT PARTY. ABOUT THEIR- CONVERSATIONS HOW GOOD THEY WERE HOW GREAT IT WAS TO SEE HIM AND HOW SHOCKED THEY WERE AND IN PARTICULAR FORMER CONGRESSMAN FAR WANTED ME TO PASS ALONG HIS. SINCERE CONDOLENCES AND HIS GRIEF AT THE LOSS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP THAT CAN DO WORK FOR SO LONG THAT HE PARTICIPATED IN THAT AND WAS CONSIDERED PART OF THEIR FAMILY SO FAR I WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE SENTIMENTS WERE EXPRESSED DURING THE CEREMONY. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED CENTER DOT.

QUITE DEEPLY AS A FORMER STAFF PERSON YOU DEVELOP REALLY CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH STAFF MEMBERS FROM OTHER OFFICES. AND YOU KNOW SENATOR NEWMAN AND I. HAVE OFFICES RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER- AND THERE'S SOME QUIET COMPETITION BECAUSE HE SNATCHED ONE OF MY LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS FROM MY OFFICE- BUT GAVE HER A PROMOTION SO THAT'S OKAY- AND WHILE I WAS A TAD SALTY. IN THE BEGINNING- I ENJOYED THE FACT THAT SHE HAD THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY MOSTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF MARK. AND HEARING HOW WARM AND GENEROUS AND KIND HEARTED HE WAS AS A CHIEF THAT MADE ME FEEL REALLY GOOD. THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE SUPPORTED. BY THIS KIND OF INDIVIDUAL. WHO WOULD HELP HER AND WOULD ALSO BRING SUCH JOY. AND INTEGRITY AND LOVE TO THAT OFFICE. OUR STAFFS TALK A LOT. BECAUSE WE ARE SO CLOSE IN PROXIMITY IN THIS CAPITAL. AND IT HAS BEEN REALLY TOUGH. FLORIDA'S STAFF IN THIS BUILDING. BECAUSE THE WORDS THAT KEEP COMING TO ME ABOUT HIM. OUR HELP. AND GENEROUS HE IS. HOW WARM HEARTED HE IS ALWAYS WALK IN WITH A SMILE ALWAYS LEADING WITH GENEROSITY THE NICEST THE WARMEST SOUL. AND SO THERE'S ALWAYS A REASON WHY OUR UNIVERSE FIRE GOD TAKES FOLKS WHEN WE THINK THEY SHOULD STILL BE WITH US AND WE MAY NOT ALWAYS KNOW WHAT THAT REASON IS I HAVE TO BELIEVE. THAT THIS ANGEL WAS NEEDED SOMEPLACE ELSE BUT I JUST WANNA SHARE AS SOMEONE WHO. CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THE STAFF COME IN ALL OF OUR OFFICES AND UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY HAVE WITH ONE ANOTHER. HOW INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT THIS LOSS HAS BEEN. BECAUSE HE WAS AN IMMENSELY GENEROUS SOUL AND HE WILL BE MISSED BEYOND MEASURE. THANK YOU SENATOR COM LONGER CENTER PAM.

AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH FILE ITEM THIRTY ONE SENATOR TO RUSSELL. YES I'M VALERIE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL TEN SEVENTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LORENA GONZALEZ AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT SENATOR RUSSELL. OKAY OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I RISE TO PRESENT A LATINO CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYWOMAN GONZALEZ THIS BILL SUPPORTS OUR STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY. BY BY ENSURING THAT HOTEL WORKERS ARE AFFORDED THE SAME ACCOMMODATIONS CURRENTLY PROVIDED THE JANITORIAL AND BUILDING MAINTENANCE SERVICE WORKERS UNDER THE DISPLACED JANITOR OPPORTUNITY ACT. THAT LAW WAS ESTABLISHED TWENTY YEARS AGO TO MINIMIZE THE IMMEDIATE DISPLACEMENT OF AN ENTIRE WORK FORCE WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE SERVICE CONTRACTORS WHAT TWENTY FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES. AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR MAKES A NARROW CHANGE BY SIMPLY ADDING SIMILARLY SITUATED HOTEL SERVICE WORKERS TO THIS EXISTING LAW THIS ENSURES HOTEL WORKERS HAVE A REASONABLE TRANSITION PERIOD. CAN CONTINUE WORKING UNDER THE NEW CONTRACTOR GIVEN THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT KOPEN HOSPITALITY WORKFORCE WE MUST MINIMIZE ANY FURTHER DISPLACEMENT OF JOBS IN THIS SECTOR AS THESE WORKERS ARE GETTING BACK ON THEIR FEET. EXISTING LAW HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY FOR DECADES A. B. TEN SEVENTY FOUR SIMPLY TAKES THAT APPROACH AND TARGET TARGETS OF SIMILAR LOW WAGE WORKFORCE MADE UP PREDOMINANTLY OF LATINA WOMEN. PROVIDING THESE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WITH A MODEST LEVEL OF JOB SECURITY IS FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR AND CRITICAL TO STABILIZING JOBS IN THE SECTOR. HAVING COME OUT OF THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY I SAW A COUPLE OF DECADES AGO THE IMPACT I WENT THROUGH THIS SIDE BY SIDE WITH HOTEL WORKERS WHO HAD. NOTHING TO DO WASN'T BECAUSE OF THEM DOING ANYTHING WRONG WHEN THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THEIR MANAGEMENT. THAT THEY WOULD BE DISPLACED IN LARGE NUMBERS WHAT ACTUALLY LED TO THIS IN LOS ANGELES PASSING AN ORDINANCE IN LOS ANGELES WAS ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR. ADD VIA COVERED THE AIRPORT FOUR FOUR FIVE HUNDRED WORKERS WERE FIRED OVERNIGHT BECAUSE THE CONTRACTOR MANAGEMENT HAD CHANGED. THAT IS WHAT LED BAND AND TRIGGERED A SERIES OF WARDEN IS BEING PASSED IN THE NUMBER OF CITIES OF THIS IS AGAIN TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO WORK. THROUGH NO- NO RESPONSIBILITY NOTHING THEY DID WRONG THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK- AND BE GIVEN A FAIR OPPORTUNITY- TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN DO THE WORK OF FOR SIXTY DAYS SO- COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE YOUR VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CENTER DRAWS SO MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE.

I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT ARE COLLEAGUES I AM TODAY PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL NINE THIRTY SEVEN DIVISION ACTS ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARDIO. THIS LEGISLATION WILL PROTECT INCARCERATED REFUGEE AND IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR REHABILITATION AND RELEASE I WILL PREVENT THEM FROM BEING FUNNELED INTO THE IMMIGRATION DEPORTATION. SYSTEM IN RECENT YEARS- THE LEGISLATURE AND CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT AND A WILLINGNESS TO REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO END MASS INCARCERATION. AND TO PROTECT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER FOR IMMIGRANTS EARN RELEASE SENATOR WIENER YES I APOLOGIZE GREATLY I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO PLEASE STOP WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS MEASURE UP LATER OKAY SCIENTOLOGY NICE. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER MEMBERS WE'RE MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM THIRTY NINE SENATOR AYERED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARAT SUSHI AN ACT RELATING TO GREENHOUSE GASES CENTER LAYERED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MMHM MADAM CHAIR- THIS BILL IS THE CLIMATE CRISIS BACKED BY SENATOR MARK SHOES SUSHI AND OTHER AUTHORS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT WE ARE FACING RIGHT NOW IS JUST REACHING EPIC PROPORTIONS. TO AVERT THE MOST CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE MUST LIMIT ATMOSPHERIC WARMING TO ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS WHICH NECESSITATES CALIFORNIA REACHING NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY MID CENTURY. FURTHER THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE RECENTLY RELEASED THE FIRST PORTION OF THE SIX TO SUSSMAN REPORT ON HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALTERING THE PLANET'S NATURAL SYSTEMS AND WORSENING. EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AROUND THE WORLD THAT WAS WITNESSED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN I WAS SECRETARY FOR NATURAL RESOURCES- I DID WORK WITH THE STATE OF NEVADA ON LAKE TAHOE AND THE SCIENTISTS TOLD US. THAT LIKE TAHOE WAS HEATING FASTER THAN ANY FRESH WATER LAKE ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET. WHEN WE- VISIT- OF MY FAMILY GLACIER PARK WE WERE BASICALLY TOLD GLAD YOU GOT HERE THE GLACIERS WILL NOT BE HERE AND ASSUME NUMBER OF YEARS. WHEN WE EXPERIENCED A FIRE THAT WENT FROM CALISTOGA TO SANTA ROSA A FEW YEARS AGO. IT WENT IN SOMETHING LIKE SIX HOURS AND A FIRE ON THE SAME FOOT PRINT IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR TO TWO AND A HALF DAYS. THE FIRE IN PARADISE- WAS SOMETHING THAT YES THERE IS- EIGHTY OR NINETY YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION BUT IT BROUGHT UP AGAINST THE CHANGES IN CLIMATE. AND THE FACT THAT THAT FAR REMOVED SIXTY ACRES A MINUTE AND YOU COULD NOT OUTRUN IT WAS IN PART DUE TO THE CONDITIONS CREATED BY CLIMATE AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A DROUGHT. AND WE'RE IN THE SECOND YEAR OF THE DROUGHT AND YEP WE HAVE PASSED WHERE WE WERE IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF THE DROUGHT FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. IN MY OWN DISTRICT LAST YEAR I WAS IN SAN LUIS OBISPO WHEN THEY RECORDED A TEMPERATURE OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DEGREES. IT IS HAPPENING. AND IT IS HAPPENING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTION. AN ACCOUNT. HAS A HISTORY OF SETTING GOALS AND USING GOALS AS THE MEANS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES I RECALL BEING A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. BUT WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A GOAL TO DIVERT 50% FROM MORE. OF WASTE DIVERSION FROM LANDFILLS IN CALIFORNIA AND I THOUGHT AT THE TIME GREAT GOAL IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN. AND YET- THAT BILL GAVE THE TOOLS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE MET THE GOAL AND WE EXCEEDED IT. I WAS ONE OF THE EARLY CO AUTHORS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX OF A. B. THIRTY TWO. AND WHAT I B. THIRTY TWO DID THIS WITH OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WALKING AWAY FROM THE KYOTO ACCORDS. WE PUT THE KYOTO ACCORDS INTO LAW IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE SAID THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY WE WOULD GO BACK TO THE MISSIONS. THAT EXISTED IN THIS STATE IN NINETEEN NINETY AND TWENTY TWENTY WE MET THAT GOAL. THEN GOVERNOR BROWN IN TWENTY ELEVEN SIGN THE BILL. THAT SAID WE WOULD GO 233% RENEWABLES AND OUR ELECTRICITY PORTFOLIO BY TWENTY TWENTY PEOPLE SAID THAT'LL BE A HARD GOAL. WE HAVE MET THAT GOAL. SO BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS THE NEXT STEP IN THAT PROCESS. THERE ARE THREE MAIN PARTS OF THIS BILL THAT CODIFIES CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY. BY OR BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE. REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY REDUCING STATEWIDE EMISSIONS BY 90% OF THE NINETY. NINETY NINETY LEVEL BY OR BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE THROUGH DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE AND REMOVAL TECHNOLOGIES. NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. AND THIRD ESTABLISH STANDARDS AND GUARDRAILS TO ENSURE THAT THESE TECHNOLOGIES A C. ACHIEVE REAL MEASURABLE VERIFIABLE CARBON REDUCTIONS. CALIFORNIA'S BEHIND THE OTHERS OTHER STATES WASHINGTON ADOPTED A LAW ON TWENTY TWENTY NEW YORK. IN TWENTY NINETEEN MESSAGE USE INTO TWENTY. ALL WITH GOALS OF REDUCING EMISSIONS BY TWENTY FIFTY- THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO GIVEN. THE CURRENT CLIMATE SITUATION AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE. FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CENTERMAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF CONCERNS AROUND THE IMPACTS OF THE SPILL ON OUR ECONOMY ON OUR JOBS. BUT I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS AND ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA CRUZ WE'RE IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. WE ARE LIVING THROUGH A TIME OF INCREDIBLE AND FRIGHTENING CHANGES TO OUR CLIMATE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAS BEEN THE HOTTEST YEAR ON RECORD. WE'VE HAD MORE INTENSE HURRICANES AND DROUGHTS AND EVER BEFORE OUR FORCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE DRIER THAN EVER IN RECORDED HISTORY LEADING TO MASSIVE WILDFIRES THAT WERE BARELY CONTROLLING. I WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THE MANY FLOOR DEBATES OVER CLIMATE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO BE ONE OF THE COOLEST YEARS THAT WE EXPERIENCE OVER THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS. OWNER PETER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE THE COOLEST YEAR ON RECORD A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW. NO MATTER WHAT WE DO TODAY EVEN IF WE GET CARBON EMISSIONS DOWN TO ZERO. OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN LOOK BACK AT TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS A YEAR. THAT WAS UNIQUELY COOL ONE WITH UNIQUELY BENIGN WEATHER EVENTS. THE HURRICANES THE WILD FIRES THE HEAT WAVES TO DROUGHTS. THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW WILL SEEM LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS. WE TALK ABOUT THE TIPPING POINT AND WHETHER WE MIGHT REACH THE TIPPING POINT BUT IF WE'RE BEING HONEST WITH OURSELVES WE ALREADY PAST THE TIPPING POINT. AT THE IPCC CONCLUDED EARLIER THIS YEAR. EVEN UNDER THE BEST CASE SCENARIOS FOR REDUCE OUR CLIMATE EMISSIONS RADICALLY. WE'RE STILL GOING TO FACE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN TEMPERATURES OF THE NEXT CENTURY. THAT WILL LEAD TO CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES. SO THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHETHER WE MIGHT REACH A THEORETICAL TIPPING POINTS ABOUT HOW FAR PAST THE TIPPING POINT WE'RE GOING TO GO. AND IF WE DON'T MAKE CHANGES NOW OR WE ONLY MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES. WE'RE LOOKING AT A LONG RUN INCREASE OF OVER TEN DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN AVERAGE TEMPERATURE. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE HOTTER THAN EVER IN HUMAN EXISTENCE. IT HASN'T BEEN THAT HOT IN THREE MILLION YEARS. WE ARE TERRAFORMING A PLANET RIGHT NOW UNLESS WE CHANGE COURSE AND QUICKLY MUCH OF OUR PLANTS GOING UNINHABITABLE. PERHAPS IN MY LIFETIME CERTAINLY WITHIN A COUPLE GENERATIONS. THIS BILL IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE. I'VE GOT CHILDREN I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE CHILDREN MY CHILDREN ARE TEN EIGHT AND FIVE. THEY CANNOT VOTE. CANNOT LOBBY YOU. CANNOT DONATE YOUR CAMPAIGNS ARE FUN AND I EAT A SUPPORT YOU. MAYBE MY KIDS WILL HAVE KIDS OF THEIR OWN AND THOSE KIDS DOWN THE LINE THEY ALSO CAN'T VOTER INFLUENCE PUBLIC POLICY. BUT THESE CHILDREN. THEIR CHILDREN THE CHILDREN OF THE FUTURE. WHO HAVE NO VOICE IN OUR POLITICAL PROCESS WE KNOW WHAT THEY NEED AND WANT FROM US TODAY. BECAUSE UNLESS WE CHANGE COURSE AND AGGRESSIVELY SO WE ARE THEM TO FUTURE OF MISERY AND HELL. OUR FUTURE PROGENY WILL EXPERIENCE HEAT WAVES THAT REGULARLY REACH A HUNDRED FORTY DEGREES. THEY WILL FACE MORE AND MORE EXTREME HURRICANES WILDFIRES TORNADOES AND DROUGHTS. THAT LOOK ABSOLUTELY BIBLICAL IN COMPARISON TO WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. THEY'LL FIGHT WARS OVER RESOURCES THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED TODAY. WATER FOOD INHABITABLE LAND. NOW I UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURE WE'RE ALL FACING TODAY. THERE IS A LOT OF OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THERE IS A LOT OF LEGITIMATE CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACTS THE AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE MANDATES MAY HAVE ON OUR ECONOMY AND OUR JOBS. BUT I WOULD ASK YOU TO WEIGH THIS AGAINST THE FUTURE WELL BEING OF OUR KIDS OUR GRANDKIDS OUR PROGENY. THE ONES THAT HAVE NO POLITICAL POWER AND NO VOICE. WHO ARE URGING YOU TO TAKE ACTION WITH THIS VOTE. WE KNOW THE COST IS A CLIMATE CHANGE WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO PREVENT THIS APOCALYPTIC FUTURE FROM HAPPENING. BUT WE NEED THE COURAGE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. NOW MANY OF YOU HEARD. ME SAY THIS QUOTE FROM THE ANCIENT GREEKS. A CIVILIZATION IS GREAT WHEN ITS ELDERS PLANT TREES WHOSE SHADE THEY KNOW THEY WILL NEVER. SIT UNDER. TODAY I'M ASKING YOU TO PLANT THOSE TREES BECAUSE WE ARE FACING. THE WORST POSSIBLE FUTURE UNLESS WE ACT AGGRESSIVELY WE HAVE TO ERR ON THE SIDE WITH. THE PROGRESSIVE POLICY RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NASTIER I VOTE. SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE MEMBERS CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE DEAL WITH THESE WORSENING IMPACTS OF THIS CRISIS IMMEDIATELY AND DECISIVELY. THOUGH SOME OF MAY BELIEVE OR ARGUE THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IS NOT AS POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING THAT'S WHAT SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS SAY I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE DEPENDS ON WHAT WE KNEW ABOUT. EVEN JUST THE MOST RECENT DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE CREATE A CLEAR COMPARISON FROM JUST ONE YEAR AGO. FIRES FLOODS HURRICANES AND OTHER WEATHER PHENOMENA ARE NOW TRULY HISTORIC AND ONLY GETTING WORSE. FROM THE COUNTER FIRE JUST UP THE ROAD FROM US TO THE DIXIE FIRE WHICH HAS BECOME CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST SINGLE WILDFIRE IN STATE HISTORY. THE HURRICANE IDA THE TERRIBLE FLOODING UP THE EASTERN SEABOARD IT IS CLEAR THAT WE MUST ACT NOW. AND ON THE AIR QUALITY FRONT ACCORDING TO THE AIR QUALITY LIFE INDEX BY UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO RESEARCHERS LIFE EXPECTANCY LOSS MAKES PARTICULATE POLLUTION MORE DEVASTATING AND COMMUNICORP BEND COMPUTER CALLED DISEASES. LIKE TUBERCULOSIS HIV AND AIDS BEHAVIORAL KILLERS LIKE CIGARETTES CIGARETTE SMOKING AND EVEN WAR BUT THAT SINK IN PARTICULATE MATTER IS WORSE THAN ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WE HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS CAUSE OF DEATH. MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HAS TAKEN MANY IMPORTANT AND HISTORIC STEPS IN RECENT YEARS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AN AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE ANY VITAL NEXT STEP. IN THAT PROCESS WILL FURTHER PROTECT CALIFORNIA FROM THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I JUST WANT TO SAY TO MY FRIENDS IN LABOR I WANT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO YOU. THAT WE WILL BE WORKING GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE GREEN JOBS ARE GOOD JOBS THAT THEY ARE UNION JOBS AND I KNOW THAT IT'S A WORRY I UNDERSTAND THAT. TO HAVE A JOB THAT IS A GOOD PAYING JOB THAT IS SCARY TO THINK THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE THERE. BUT WE HAVE TO ACT BUT WE HAVE TO CHANGE AND I COMMIT TO ALL OF YOU THAT I WILL WORK HARD AS LONG AS I'M IN THE SENATE AND OUT OF THE SENATE TO MAKE SURE AS WE TRANSITION TO CLEAN JOBS. THOSE ARE GOOD UNION LIVING WAGE JOBS. MEMBERS I THINK ABOUT IN TEN YEARS FROM NOW. MY GRANDCHILDREN WILL BE ELEVEN AND TWELVE LITTLE NIGGLES BIRTHDAY IS TODAY HE'S ONE YEAR OLD. WHEN THEY LOOK AT ME AND THEY SAY NANA WHEN YOU WERE A SENATOR DID YOU DO EVERYTHING TO SAVE THE PLANET. I WANT TO BE A LOOK AT THEM AS A YES NANA DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO SAVE THE PLANET. I RESPECTFULLY OFFER NOT ABOUT. SENATOR ALAN. MEMBERS ALL RIGHT I HAVE A SMALL CHILD. OUR COLLEAGUE IS- LITERALLY AT HIS WIFE'S BED TODAY. AS SHE GIVES BIRTH TO A- BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CHILD. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH THE- KNICKS BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL THESE- THIS IS OUR SENATE FAMILY THESE ARE THESE LITTLE ONES WHO ARE. COMING UP. AND THE KIND OF WORLD THAT WE'RE GIVING TO THEM. IS ONE THAT IS VERY MUCH IN JEOPARDY IT'S IN DANGER. HI WE ARE STARTING TO SEE TRENDS ON OUR PLANET THAT. SHOCKED US ALL. THE SPEED WITH WHICH- PUTTING A STAR TO TAKE PLACE IN PLACES WE NEVER HAD BEFORE FIRES HAVE YOU SEEN HERE IN OUR OWN STATE. THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY THAT'S NOW. AT RISK ON COASTLINES. REMEMBER THIS IS A REASONABLE BILL GIVEN THE ENORMITY OF THE CHALLENGE. THERE'S A BILL WITH PROBABLY TWO WEEK A TIME LINE. IT'S A BILL THAT. GIVES A LOT OF DISCRETION. TO THE AIR BOARD TO DO WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO TO. MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA'S AT THE HEAD OF THE LINE IN TERMS OF INNOVATION. THERE WILL BE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE TRANSITION THAT TAKES PLACE UNDER. THE WORK. WILL IT WILL BE JUST. THERE'S NO REASON WHY CALIFORNIA CAN'T CONTINUE TO BE A MAJOR INNOVATOR AND JOB CREATOR AS WE COME ALONG AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO HELP SOLVE THIS CRISIS. AND BY THE WAY THIS BILL PROVIDES JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR OIL SECTOR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN AN ISSUE FOR A CONTROVERSY ON THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE BUT THERE'S LANGUAGE IN HERE THAT ALLOWS FOR. CARBON CAPTURE WHICH I KNOW IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY CONTROVERSIAL BUT IT'S SOMETHING IT'S VERY MEANINGFUL TO MANY MANY PEOPLE AROUND OUR STATE AND OF COURSE IT'S A TECHNIQUE THAT COULD END UP BECOMING A REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL IN OUR TOOL KIT AS WE TRY TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. IN ORDER TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE NEED TO WORK ON EMISSIONS REDUCTION WE NEED TO WORK ON. CCS INNOVATION. NATURAL CARBON SINKS. THIS BILL IS GOING TO. SET US ON COURSE. FOR THE FOR THE INVESTMENT THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT THAT WILL. LET GIVE US A FIGHTING CHANCE. TO STAND SOME OF THESE INCREDIBLY DISTURBING TRENDS. I JUST INVITE FOLKS TO READ SOME OF THE SCIENCE READ THE PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT LIFE WILL LOOK LIKE ON OUR PLANET THEN THINK ABOUT THESE LITTLE BABIES. YOUR GRANDCHILDREN OUR CHILDREN WHAT KIND OF LIFE WERE HANDED TO THEM WHAT SORT OF LEGACY AND WHAT SORT OF CONVERSATION WE ALL WANT TO HAVE WITH THEM AS WE END OUR OWN LIVES. ABOUT THE WORK WE DID TO MAKE SURE THE LIFE WOULD BE BETTERFOR THEM THAT'S WHY WE NEED BILLS LIKE THIS IS A BOLD BILL. BUT THE PROBLEM IS SO ENORMOUS. THAT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A STEP LIKE THIS AND SO I STRONGLY STRONGLY URGE YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR OUR FUTURE PLEASE. SUPPORT THIS BILL. SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THE LEGISLATION AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR SO ARTICULATELY- DESCRIBING THE STAKES HERE YOU KNOW SO I THINK SOMETIMES WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S SO EASY FOR US FOR OUR SOCIETY TO OUR PLANET IT HAS TO BECOME LIKE A DEER CAUGHT IN HEADLIGHTS. YOU SEE THIS TRUST DISASTER ABSOLUTE DISASTER COMING OUR WAY AND WE'RE SEEING WHAT THAT DISASTER HEALTH DISASTER MANIFESTS IN OUR DAILY LIVES WITH THE ORANGE SKIES ND THE POSSIBILITY OF A LITERALLY RUNNING OUT OF WATER AND THE SUPER. STORMS AND I CAN GO ON AND ON AND ON. WE SEE IT COMING. BUT IT'S JUST SO BIG THAT WE FREEZE. AND WE EITHER DO NOTHING OR WE NIBBLE AROUND THE EDGES. AND IF WE- GIVE A EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS PLANET. THEN IT'S TIME TO GO BIG AND GO BOLD WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. NOT TOMORROW OR A YEAR OR TEN YEARS FROM NOW BUT NOW THAT I KNOW THE POLITICS ARE HARD. BECAUSE MEANINGFULLY ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN OUR WORLD AND OUR DAILY LIVES IN TERMS OF OUR ECONOMY. IT MEANS THINGS HAVE TO BE DONE DIFFERENTLY AND THAT IS HARD THOSE TRANSITIONS ARE HARD AND I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THAT PAIN THAT THOSE TRANSITIONS CAN CAUSE. BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE. JUST TO ALLOW THE SLOW MOVING TRAIN WRECK TO CONTINUE TO BECOME A VERY FAST MOVING TRAIN WRECK AND THEN WE DRIVE A CAR TRULY INTO THE DITCH. I DON'T WANT A FUTURE FOR OUR PLANET. THAT IS DRAMATICALLY WORSE THAN WE'RE ALREADY SEEING RIGHT NOW I DON'T WANT TO I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS TO AND IT'S TIME TO TAKE BOLD ACTION. I DO WANT TO SERVICE ADDRESS- IN TERMS OF JOBS IN THE ECONOMY AND I HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY UNDER DOING THAT HARD WORK- AND I'VE WORKED VERY HARD TO GET THOSE GOOD PAYING JOBS- AND I HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT. FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE HARM TO OUR ECONOMY AND JOBS THAT UNCONTROLLED CLIMATE CHANGE. IS DOING TO THE ATTIC IN THE STREET. WHICH IS BEING DECIMATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. TWO ARE HEADED TO HOUSING. THE PEOPLE WHO BUILD HOUSING WHEN MORE AND MORE PARTS OF THE STATE ARE GONNA BE UNTENABLE TO EVEN BUILD ANY HOUSING. BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE RISKS OF WILDFIRES AND SEA LEVEL RISE. TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WHICH IS GOING TO BE OVERRUN. BY THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. WHICH IS ALREADY BEING DAMAGE AND WILL BE A HUGE RISK AND OF COURSE ANY INDUSTRY. THAT RELIES ON WATER. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM. WE ALSO KNOW THE CLIMATE CHANGE DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHETHER PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN IN LOW LYING AREAS AND ARE SUBJECT TO SEA LEVEL RISE PEOPLE ON COMMUNITIES THAT RUN OUT OF WATER. IT CETERA TO COLLEAGUES AND DID THIS IN A WAY UNDERSTANDS POLITICALLY THIS IS A HARD BILL- BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IT'S NOT AND I ASKED FOR AN IPO. SENATOR BAKER. MEMBERS THREE FIVE SAYING AROUND HERE THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL. AND WHY DO I SAY THAT BECAUSE THE SIMPLY ASK THE QUESTION ARE WE SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING TO CARBON NEUTRALITY. BECAUSE IF WE ARE THEN WE CAN QUIBBLE ABOUT THE TIME LINE WASHINGTON STATE HAS SAID 95% REDUCTION BY TWENTY FIFTY. NEW YORK STATE 85% BY TWENTY FIFTEEN MASSACHUSETTS 85% BY TWENTY FIFTY THIS BILL IS 90% DIRECT EMISSIONS BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS AN OFFRAMP FROM AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND I'D BE HAPPY THAT WAS MOVED UP IN THAT IT ALLOWS AN OFFERING FOR THE IRISES EVEREST RESOURCE SUPPORT SAY IS THAT THE RIGHT NUMBERS AT 90% IS IT 85% IT ALLOWS THAT THE OFF RAMP. BUT ALSO GIVES DIRECTION TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD DESCRIBING PLANS A TWENTY TWENTY TWO SCOPING PLAN TO THOSE EIGHT AWAIT NO IT'S OUR JOB TO DIRECT KERR. DID YOU WHAT WE WANT. SO FOR SERIOUS ABOUT IT THE CARBON NEUTRALITY. THEN LET'S GET THE TIMELINE IN. IN AT THIS POINT WE'RE FALLING BEHIND OTHER STATES. NOT LEADING ADVERTISERS ABOUT THAT WE HAVE TO GET READY FOR LOTS MORE FIRES AND DEVASTATION BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. A LOT OF ELOQUENT SPEECHES ON CLIMATE CHANGE I TRY TO DRESS TO A PIECES OF THIS ONE THE CHIEF ABILITY AND SECOND ON JOBS. NEVER ONE CAN WE GET THERE. ABSOLUTELY WE SEE THE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCED SO RAPIDLY IN SOLAR AND WIND AND GEOTHERMAL. I JUST TALKING TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES REMEMBER WHEN EXXON WAS THAT AT THE HIGHEST MARKET CAP OF ANY. ANY COMPANY IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW TESLA AT THE START OF MY DISTRICT HAS THREE AND A HALF TIMES. THE MARKET CAP. OF EXXON MOBIL. SO IT HAS COME DOWN 90% IN THE LAST TEN YEARS 99% OF THE LAST TWENTY OR SO YEARS WIND ENERGY THE COSTS KEEP FALLING SO WE CAN ACHIEVE THIS BUT WE MUST DO THIS IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY. THINGS EVERYONE ALONG AND WE CAN'T. LET'S USE THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS OPTIONS FROM A CABBAGE TRADE OPTIONS. TO BRING EVERYONE ALONG WE ABSOLUTELY. CAN DO THAT. AND WE MUST DO THAT. ON JOBS THIS BILL DOES PRESERVE SOME JOBS AS MIKE MY COLLEAGUE THAT MENTIONED. BUT WE DO NEED GOOD JOBS AS MIGHT AS A COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO MENTION WE DO NEED GOOD JOBS IN CLEAN ENERGY. AS WELL THEN WE'D FORTUNATELY WE HAVE THE THREE NIGHTS POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE PASSED YESTERDAY. FOR INTER E. V. CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THOSE WILL BE UNION JOBS. THE WIND BILL THAT WE PASSED YESTERDAY THAT'S ETIMATED TO CREATE OFFSHORE WIND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. GEOTHERMAL EVERYTHING NON CORRELATED WITH SOLAR IT'S GOING TO CREATE ENERGY STORAGE DOES WHAT LONG TERM SOURCES WILL ALL CREATE. GOOD UNION JOBS I WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THAT THE BUILDING TRADES IN PARTICULAR ALWAYS BEEN A PARTNER. IN CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS MOST OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS GAMES HAVE ACTUALLY COME FROM THE REAL CRITICAL PORTFOLIO STANDARD. NOT ACTUALLY BEEN CAPTURED OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT COME FROM THE R. P. S. 55% 10% TWENTY PERCENT. THAT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT LABOR SP ONE HUNDRED WOULD NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT LABOR BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THOSE AREAS IN GEOTHERMAL IN OFFSHORE WIND IN LONG DURATION. STORAGE I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO MY CAR PROCESS WORK WITH ABOUT- OR MAKING FUN OF THIS PERCENT OF 2% AND SO I'M SURE THE FACT THAT ONE POINT 6% OF OUR WORKERS IN THE STATE WORKING OIL AND GAS. IT MAY NOT BE IMPORTANT TO THEM BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME AND WE HAVE TO. THINK. ABOUT THAT TRANSITION AND A NEW REPORT. ADDRESSED BY NINE UNION INCLUDE TRUE WERE SOUTH OF CALIFORNIA OIL WORKERS. ESTIMATES ARE STATE COULD CREATE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY. FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CLEAN ENERGY JOBS PER YEAR. THROUGH A PROGRAM TO CUT CLIMATE POLLUTION IN HALF OVER THE NEXT DECADE. IT SAYS IT COULD CREATE EVEN MORE JOBS SIX HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PER YEAR. TWO INVESTMENT IN RELATED AREAS SUCH AS WATER INFRASTRUCTURE LEAKY GAS PIPELINES PUBLIC PARKS AND ROADWAYS. TO SOME BUT NOT ALL OF WHICH WOULD ALSO REDUCE EMISSIONS. BUT LEADER OF ONE OF THOSE UNITS WAS ASKED WHAT WAS GOING ON HE SAID QUOTE. AN ENERGY TRANSITION IS COMING WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. AND IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE BUILD A SECURE FUTURE FOR WORKERS AD THEIR FAMILIES. AS WELL WORKER YOU'RE STANDING ON THE TRACK. AND YOU CAN SEE THE TRAIN COMING. WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHY THE TRAIN IS COMING. WE CAN TALK ABOUT EXACTLY WHEN IT'S GOING TO GET HERE. BUT IT'S COMING HE SAID. THE CHOICE FOR US IS DO WE STILL HAVE A TRUCK AND FACE WHATEVER HAPPENS. WHEN WE GET ON THE PLATFORM AND TRY TO CATCH THE TRAIN. GOING OUT OF THAT STATION. MY FRIENDS LET'S CATCH A TRAIN TO THE FUTURE AND I WOULD REMIND YOU SOMETHING VICE PRESIDENT KHAMA HARRIS SAID LAST YEAR. HE SAID OUR CHILDREN OUR GRANDCHILDREN LOOK INTO OUR EYES. LET'S SEE WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH. PEOPLE ASK US WHAT WAS IT LIKE. ANDWE WILL TELL THEM SHE SAID WE'LL TELL NOT JUST HOW WE FELT. WE'LL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. MEMBERS ARE SPECTRAL ASTRO VOTE ON THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE. SENATOR DODD. YES MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS- I NORMALLY- I'VE MADE IT A PRACTICE NEVER TO US STAND UP AND SPEAK AGAINST A DEMOCRATIC BILL. NEVER AND I'VE NEVER SPOKEN AGAINST ANYTHING CLIMB IN FACT I'VE GOT THE HIGHEST RATINGS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS FOR MY VOTING RECORD IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS BUT THERE'S A FALSE NARRATIVE GOING ON IN THIS BUILDING RIGHT NOW THAT IF YOU DON'T VOTE FOR THIS BILL YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU I VOTED FOR EVERY CLIMATE CHANGE BILL ON THIS FLOOR I ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR% WHEN I SERVED IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THEY'RE IMPORTANT. BUT THE IDEA. IF WE DON'T PASS THIS DAY TODAY. THAT OUR CHILDREN AND-GRANDCHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE AT RISK TOMORROW. NEXT YEAR. AGAIN IS A FALSE NARRATIVE YOU KNOW BECAUSE I STOOD UP ON THE FLOOR VERY PROBABLY HOW MANY GRANDCHILDREN I'VE HAD I HAVE TWELVE AND I LOVE HIM VERY MUCH. AND I WANT THE VERY BEST FUTURE FOR THEM. BUT I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE IN MY HEART. BUT MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL. MORE SITES IS GOING TO BE DEVELOPED. THROUGH THE SCOPING PLAN WITH DATA AND SCIENCE. IT EXPERIENCE WILL ALWAYS LEAD TO BETTER DECISIONS AND I THINK THIS THING IS BEING RUSHED TODAY TO GET OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA CAN HAVE THE BEST POLICY POSSIBLE. WITH IT YOU KNOW IT IN IF IT PASSES ARE NOT ACTIVELY GOING OUT AND TRYING TO KILL THIS BILL I'M NOT I'M JUST NOT GOING TO SUPPORT TODAY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING I THINK THAT SHOULD BE A TWO YEAR BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOVO. THANK YOU SENATOR DODSON EARLY MON. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR YOU'VE ALL HEARD THE DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ABOUT THE I. P. P. C. STUDIES AT AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE TIME TO ACT IT WAS DECADES AGO- THAT ARE FOR WE ARE LIVING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE NOW- BUT WE WERE DECADES AGO IN THE FUTURE YOU'VE HEARD ALL OUR COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT HOW. CHALLENGING IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT HE DISTRICT I REPRESENT AND THE VALUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT I THINK ABOUT THIS BILL AND WHAT IT MEANS TO THE TO THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT END YOU KNOW JUST SHORT OF A YEAR BEING A HUB. SWORN INTO THE LEGISLATURE WE EXPERIENCE THE THOMAS FIRE DECEMBER FOURTH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THAT LED TO A DEBRIS FLOW. WE LOST LIVES BECAUSE OF THE WILDFIRE AND THE DEBRIS FLOW NOT TO MENTION THE ECONOMIC IMPACT. CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES LESS THAN HALF THE SIZE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY- AND NOW TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIRES COST US. A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION IN DAMAGES. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH WE PUT IN THE IMPACT IS STILL GREAT TO ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. CLIMATE IMPACTS CONTINUE TO CAUSE DEVASTATING HUMAN LOSS CAPITAL LOSS NOT TO MENTION THE DISPLACEMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH OUR DISTRICT MY DISTRICT HAS LIVED THAT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE HOTTER THERE IS MORE DROUGHT MY DISTRICT HAS NEVER GOTTEN OUT OF THE DROUGHT THE PART OF THE DISTRICT OF THE CALIFORNIA BUT I LIVE IN IS EITHER THE BEGINNING OF A CONNECTION OR THE END OF A CONNECTION TO A WHOLE LOT OF SYSTEMS. AND SO WE'VE ALWAYS STRUGGLED. WITH THE WATER CONNECTIONS THERE AND WE'VE LIVED THE DROUGHT- IN MANY WAYS AND NOW WE'RE MORE THAN TWO DECADES INTO A MAKE A DROUGHT ON PAR WITH THE DRIEST TIMES OF THE LAST MILLENNIUM. ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE ISSUES THAT REPRESENT. GREAT CONCERN TO THE DISTRICT BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON EVERYONE IN THE DISTRICT WHETHER IT'S MY ELEVEN MONTH OLD CHILD OR WHETHER IT'S A UNION WORKER IN THE DISTRICT WHEN WE HAD SOME OF THESE IMPACTS IN OUR STATE IN OUR DISTRICT WE HAD TO CLOSE HIGHWAY ONE OH ONE FOR THIRTEEN DAYS. EVERY ENTITY IN EVERY INDUSTRY I REPRESENTED WAS IMPACTED. SO THE AD I'M THE EIGHTH AND THIRTY I REPRESENT THE EIGHTH AND THIRTEENTH LARGEST AG PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE STATE. ABSOLUTELY IMPACTED THERE WAS NOT A WAY TO GET BACK AND FORTH. ON THAT ONE- ONE. WE ALSO BENEFIT FROM TOURISM. ALL OF OUR TOURISM INDUSTRY WAS COMPLETELY IMPACTED. AND SO I SHARE THIS WITH YOU BECAUSE I ALSO THINK THAT AMONG THE NARRATIVES THAT ARE OUT THERE IS THAT THOSE THAT ARE MOVING THIS FORWARD DON'T CARE ABOUT WORKERS. I CARE ABOUT WORKERS I HAVE A HISTORY OF SHOWING THAT PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT MY LEGISLATIVE RECORD. AND THIS IMPACTS WORKERS AS WELL AS EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE DISTRICT. DO I WANT TO DO RIGHT FOR EVERYONE ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW IN IN THE LATE IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND CLIMATE ISSUES HERE IN THE STATE I'VE BEEN CALLED A WHOLE LOT OF NAMES OF WHOLE LOTTA NAMES FOR CARING ABOUT ISSUES THAT ARE IMPACTING EVERYONE I REPRESENT. AND I WANT FOLKS TO KNOW THAT MY SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IN ADDITION. TO THE FINDING THAT WE'VE ALLOCATED TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT WE NEED TO MOVE LEGISLATION AND POLICY FORWARD. THAT HELPS US. ALSO TRIED TO SLOW DOWN SOME OF THESE IMPACTS BECAUSE YOU'RE SEEING THAT WE CAN'T JUST PUT MONEY INTO IT AND THAT ALONE WILL SOLVE. THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND WE BOTH AGREE. THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SHARED GOALS I BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY WANTS. TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY. WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO TO WORK FOR PEOPLE HAVING WATER WHERE PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT FROM THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE THERE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO. TAKE A LOOK AND REALLY EXAMINE DEBT YOU KNOW DIFFICULT. DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO HAVE A PLAN FOR PEOPLE TO WORK ON. AND SO I STAND IN SUPPORT I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT BILL I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE THE DECISION THAT YOU WILL NOT RETURN CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL. BUT LIKE I SAID EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN A BILL DID NOT MOVE FORWARD THAT TO MY COLLEAGUE AND I AM. AND A FEW OTHERS WORKED ON- MICHAEL UNITE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. WHEN IS THE TIME GOING TO BE FOR US TO SIT AT THE TABLE AND HAVE THESE HARD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE DO MORE. HERE IN THIS STATE FOR EVERYONE WE REPRESENT I KNOW THESE ARE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS AND I HOPE TO BE PART OF THEM BUT I ALSO HOPE THAT WE ALL COMMIT TO TRYING TO FIND A WAY. NOT JUST TO MOVE FORWARD IDEAS BUT TO REALLY TRY TO SLOW DOWN AND THE IMPACTS THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US IS LIVING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR LEE MOUNT CENTER DRAWS SO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING PROGRAMS DECADES AGO. THEY LEFT OUT ANYTHING RELATED TO WAGE POLICIES. IT WAS LEFT TO ORDINARY PEOPLE TO TRY TO ORGANIZE. THE QUOTE UNQUOTE GREEN JOBS THAT IMMIGRANT WORKERS DID. THEY SORTED THROUGH RECYCLED MATERIALS USE CONDOMS AND HYPODERMIC NEEDLES WITHOUT SAFETY GLOVES AND FOR WAGES THAT ARE SOCIETAL DISGRACE. I WAS THERE. THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN NECESSARY IF THE LEGISLATURE HAD TIED ECONOMIC JUSTICE TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS. IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT THIS LEGISLATURE GAVE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THE POWER. TO PRIORITIZE CAP AND TRADE REVENUES FOR QUOTING CODE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IT HASN'T HAPPENED. AND WHILE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS GOT FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO CONSUME LESS GASOLINE LOWER INCOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING WHAT THEIR BOARD CALLS PRICING POLISH POLICIES THAT PUNISH THEM FOR WHAT. WE'RE USING WHAT THEY NEED. MY PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL ISN'T WHAT IT SAYS. BUT WHAT IT DOESN'T SAY. NOT A WORD ABOUT JOBS OR WAGES NOT A WORD ABOUT ECONOMIC JUSTICE NOT A WORD ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVING WHATEVER THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD'S COME UP WITH. WHEN I RAISE THESE CONCERNS I AM TOLD THAT THOSE THINGS COULD BE ADDRESSED LATER. WELL I DIDN'T COME AND I'M SURE MANY OR ALL OF YOU DIDN'T COME TO THE SENATE. TO WAIT. I WAS IN MY TWENTIES WHEN I BEGAN FIGHTING FOR GARMENT WORKERS. I CAME TO THE SENATE TO HELP WIN THAT FIGHT NOT WAIT. OVER A DECADE AGO BOMBER KERR BECAME LAW. I CAME TO THE SENATE. AS YOU HAVE TO HELP WIN HEALTH CARE FOR OLDER IMMIGRANTS IN CALIFORNIA. NOT TO WAIT. GOING TO JAIL TWENTY THREE TIMES TO WIN DECENT WAGES AND HEALTH CARE FOR HOTEL WORKERS. I LEARNED THE HARD WAY THAT THERE IS NO EASY WAY. THIS BILL IS UNFINISHED. UNLESS WE SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY THE WORKING POOR WILL ALWAYS BE THE LAST IN LINE. WE CAN INCLUDE WAGE POLICIES FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN REGRESSIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE DOESN'T NEED TO COME AT THE EXPENSE OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE. THANK YOU SENATOR TORONTO CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR WEIGHING IN ON ON VARIOUS SIDES OF THIS ISSUE YOU KNOW- I'M A SENATOR IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN MANY OF COMMITTEE HEARINGS ETCETERA THAT REPRESENTS- SOME OF THE HIGHEST POLLUTED REGIONS OF LOS ANGELES- COMING FROM THE PORT OF LOS AT PORT OF LONG BEACH EXCUSE ME- THROUGH THE SEVEN TEN COMMUNITIES WITH MOBILE AND STATIONARY SOURCES OF POLLUTION EXCITE IS IN MY BACKYARD I DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY. ANYMORE UNFORTUNATELY TO SIT BACK AND CONTINUE TO NOT PASS LEGISLATION THAT WILL ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. AND I'M ALSO THE DAUGHTER OF A TEAMSTER DAUGHTER OF A VERY PROUD- TRUCK DRIVER WHO FOUGHT FOR THIRTY YEARS WOKE UP EVERY MORNING. TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR MY PARENTS SO I UNDERSTAND THAT. I BELIEVE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND WORK FORCE CAN CO EXIST THEY CAN. AND I'M COMMITTED TO THAT I THINK MANY OF US HERE ON THIS FLOOR ARE COMMITTED TO THAT. BUT WE CANNOT IGNORE THE IMPACTS I HAVE A FIRST GRADER. WHAT IS HIS LIFE GOING TO LOOK LIKE. TWO DECADES FROM NOW. WHEN THE PLANET IS WARMING. MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS. WHEN THE U. N. IS CALLING OUT AND SAYING CODE RED AND WE'RE SITTING BACK DOING NOTHING. THE CLIMATE ACTION ABSOLUTELY CANNOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ONE IN WHICH I REPRESENT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES WERE ALREADY DEALING WITH THESE IMPACTS. IN FACT YOU LOOK UP ANY HEADLINE ON THE NEW YORK TIMES AND- THESE ARE THE HEADLINES. MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE MILLION PEOPLE UNDER HE ALERTS AS MUCH OF. THE U. S. IS SCORCHED AGAIN THIS WEEK. TROPICAL STORM FRED FORMS JUST SOUTH OF PORTO RICO I WOULD WANT TO DIE RIGHT HERE IN AID OF AMERICAN COMMUNITY FIGHTS TO PROTECT ITS LAND FROM THE DIXIE FIRE. IN THE VALLEY WHERE ONE TOWN BURNED FIRE CREWS AND VOLUNTEERS ARE STILL BATTLING THE FLAMES. CANADIAN WILDFIRES COULD INTENSIFY FROM A LOOMING HEATWAVE. SO I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES ALL OF THEM WHO ADDRESSED CONCERNS AGAIN ON ON MULTIPLE SIDES OF THIS ISSUE I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND I BELIEVE THAT IF THIS POLICY PASSES WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT WE DO BUILD A CALIFORNIA THAT TRULY IS REPRESENTATIVE OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE BOLD ON THESE ISSUES WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ SAID HER TADO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I RISE. TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS JUST AS MUCH AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION. I WANT TO HELP FIGHT STOP CLIMATE CHANGE AS WELL. THIS BILL HOWEVER IS THE WRONG APPROACH AND I IT'S MY OPINION THAT IT'S UNREALISTIC. TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO FOCUS ON HUMAN SECURITY ADAPTATION AND- MORE PARTLY INNOVATION AS WELL. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON REDUCTIONS FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN THE STATE. BUT WHAT HAS IT DONE FOR DISTRICTS LIKE MINE. IT'S CREATED MORE POVERTY. AND MORE SUFFERING. AND MORE DEATHS. REDUCTION IS NOT HELPING MY DISTRICT IT'S MAKING LIFE WORSE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THERE. WE HAVE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON PRODUCTION THAT WE ARE FAILING TO ADAPT AND TO INNOVATE. WE NEED TO EMPOWER ONE ANOTHER AND- WE ALSO NEED TO EMPOWER INDUSTRY TO BE INNOVATORS AND LEADERS OF INNOVATION THAT WILL HELP US. STOP CLIMATE CHANGE OUR FUTURE TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR FAILURE TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE IS WHAT'S KILLING PEOPLE. OUR APPROACH IS NOT WORKING. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL SAVE LIVES IT WILL NOT STOP CLIMATE CHANGE OUR APPROACH MUST CHANGE TO SAVE THIS PLANET. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO SAVE MANKIND. AND FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR HER TITLE CENTER BOARD JUST. COLLEAGUES I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED THE- LAST NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN A SENATOR WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN ALL THAT WE'RE DOING LEADING THE CHARGE AS CALIFORNIANS. THE BUDGET INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING IN. OUR GREEN TECHNOLOGY AND MODIFYING OUR FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY ENGINE FIVE NEW AREAS OF ENTERPRISE. WE TAUGHT OURSELVES FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING. BUT TODAY I HEAR THAT WE'RE AT THE PRECIPICE HAVING DONE NOTHING. SO WHAT WHAT IS IT. HAVE WE BEEN LACKADAISICAL HEAD AND OUT TO LUNCH ON THIS ISSUE FOR AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THIS BODY I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE EVERY BILL SENSE OF IMMEDIACY. THAT UNLESS WE PASS IT WE ARE. DERELICT IN OUR DUTIES IN THE STEWARDS OF NOT ONLY OUR STATE BUT ON A BILL WITH OUR PLANET. TWO DAYS AGO I THINK WE HAD A BILL. TO CREATE A UC PARTNERSHIP WITH CHINA. FOR A THINK TANK RESEARCH FACILITY A SO THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADAPT TO THE NEW REALITY IN WHAT WE WANT TO LOOK LIKE. AND WE ALL SUPPORTED THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT DOESN'T HURT TO ACCUMULATE INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE DESPITE MY MISGIVINGS ON THE BILL ITSELF. BUT I REMAIN CONFUSED BY HARKING BACK TO THE COMMENTS FROM THE SENATOR FROM NAPA. THANK YOU YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW OUR CLIMATE IS CHANGING. BUT MY BOOK BY VOTING AGAINST THIS ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE A CLIMATE CHANGE DENIER. THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT BEING PRACTICAL. WHEN YOU PUSH SOMETHING AS AMBITIOUS AS THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IT'S ALMOST BECOME SYMBOLIC WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE PUSHING FOR BECAUSE WHAT I'D LOVE TO SEE. OR THE METRICS THAT GO ALONG WITH THE NUMBERS OF THE NEW EMPLOYMENT SCHEME IN THE GREEN NEW DEAL. BECAUSE WE ALWAYS TAUGHT ALL THE NEW JOBS THAT WOULD GO ALONG WITH. A NEW PIECE OF LEGISLATION RARELY DO I HEAR THAT NUMBER QUANTIFIED pWILL BE LOST BY PREMATURELY IN SYMBOLICALLY TRANSFERRING INTO A NEW FORM OF ENTERPRISE OR TECHNOLOGY. IF WE'RE BEING HONEST WE HAVE TO DO THAT. I THINK INDUSTRY WHETHER IT'S IN THE OIL FIELD OR IN AGRICULTURE OR IN CEMENT. AS WE DISCUSSED YESTERDAY. CALIFORNIA IS THE GOLD STANDARD SO FOR TO HEAR FOLKS SAY THAT WE'RE BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL AND HAVE DONE NOTHING. YET TELL OURSELVES AS THE GOLD STANDARD NOT ONLY IN IN IN CALIFORNIA AS CALIFORNIANS BUT WITHIN. THE U. S. IN OVERSEAS WHICH ONE IS IT ARE WE STEWARDS AGAIN ARE WE BEING AMBITIOUS OR ARE WE BEING LACKADAISICAL I THINK. A BILL LIKE THIS. NEEDS TO BE VETTED IN A MORE SERIOUS WAY. IN PUTTING OUT AN AMBITIOUS GOALS SO THAT WE CAN TELL IT IT ON SOME SORT OF CAMPAIGN FLYER BUT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO BY YOUR TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THAT'S THE SAME RATIONALE OF THE PARIS ACCORDS. BUT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN MANY OF THOSE CONSTRUCTS OF THE PARIS ACCORDS. BUT WE DO DO YOU TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION IN SO MANY WAYS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS SUSTAINABLE AND BEING HONEST WITH THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT. WE HAVE A HISTORY AS LEGISLATORS OF PRO CLAIMING THESE BOLD AMBITIOUS GOALS. AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW WECAN'T ACHIEVE THEM WE CREATE ANOTHER SET OF GOALS TO MASK WHAT WE WERE UNABLE TO DO IN THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS SO I THINK IF WE'RE BEING HONEST. PUT FORWARD. IN REAL TERMS. A PLAN WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ACCOMMODATES IT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION JOB LOSS VERSUS JOB CREATION ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES THAT WE WILL BE A PART OF NOT JUST THE 1% OF THE CLIMATE- PARTICIPATION THAT WE HAVE AS CALIFORNIANS BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN THE GREATER SCHEME OF THINGS WITHIN THE U. S. IN THE MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE EMERGING MARKETS LIKE CHINA AND INDIA. YOU CAN'T PLAY CHESS ONE PIECE. YOU GOT TO SEE HOW IT ALL FITS TOGETHER AND FRANKLY THESE OVER AMBITIOUS OVERLY SYMBOLIC GESTURES SOUNDS GOOD BUT I THINK THEY LACK SUBSTANCE. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I. BEEN LISTENING TO A LOT OF DEBATE IS QUITE FASCINATING- TO LISTEN. TO HISTORY ABOUT WHERE CALIFORNIA'S BEEN IN WEATHER WE'VE BEEN LEADING INTO WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS GO FORWARD BUT I HEARD A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT MEMBERS AND- THEIR FAMILIES AND WHY THEY CAME HERE IN. I THINK MAYBE I SHOULD TELL MY STORY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY I CAME TO THIS LEGISLATURE. I CAME AS A REPUBLICAN. WHO LIVES IN A VERY SMALL TOWN. LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE. ALSO COME FROM A FAMILY OF HOME THAT HOMESTEADED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND HAS WORKED THE SAME PIECE OF LAND. FOR EIGHTY YEARS I'M THE THIRD GENERATION MY SONS AND MY DAUGHTER WILL BE ARE THE FOURTH GENERATION. I CAME TO. LOOK FOR TRUE ENVIRONMENTALISTS WHEN I SAY THAT. I'M NOT. SAYING YOU'RE NOT IN ENVIRONMENTS BUT SOMEBODY WHO WILL SAY WE NEED TO CUT A TREE BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. NOT BECAUSE- AN ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP. TELLS YOU THAT IT'S THE WRONG THING TO DO SO I. HAVE HAD FORESTRY TOURS I'VE INVITED MANY OF YOU TO THE DISTRICT TO EDUCATE BECAUSE I BELIEVE EDUCATION. OF WHAT IS REAL AND NOT WHAT IS NOT POLITICAL WILL MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. AND YES I MOVED LOTS OF FORESTRY BILLS THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE AND BEEN SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL. BUT I VOTED AGAINST TARGETS WHICH THIS BILL IS A TARGET THERE'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF SUBSTANCE AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. AND FOR ME I DON'T HAVE THE TRUST THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. NOW I PUSH BACK ON. TECHNOLOGIES BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WE'LL GET US WHERE WE WANT TO GO. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU TO DATE AFTER A. B. THIRTY TWO WE HAVE SPENT EIGHT BILLION. DOLLARS CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS. ON A TRAIN. AND HAVE NOT LAID ONE FOOT OF TRACK. ONE PUT. THAT'S WHY I DON'T TRUST THIS PROCESS NOW IN THAT PROCESS LABOUR LINED UP RIGHT NOW LABOR IS NOT ON BOARD BUT IF LABOR WAS ON BOARD. THIS BILL WOULD BE OUT OF HERE. WE ALL KNOW THE TRUTH BECAUSE OF POLITICAL IT'S ABOUT JOBS DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY DO FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IT'S ABOUT JOBS. SORRY I'M GETTING LOUD. AS I WATCH. COMPANIES LEAVE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO WORK HERE. AND THEY GO TO STATES WHERE THEY'RE NOT REGULATED AS HEAVY OR THEY GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES. AND THAT'S YOUR JOBS THAT ARE LEAVING THE STATE. THE EXODUS OF JOBS OUT OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF OUR REGULATIONS AND THE REGULATIONS ARE CHANGING THE ENVIRONMENT. AS I TALKED ABOUT THE BILL TO REGULATE. LAWN MOWERS AND WEED EATERS AS MY FOREST IS BURNING DOWN THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD MORE POWER WITH THIS BILL. THEY GOT WAY TOO MUCH AS IT IS WE NEED TO HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT ON WHAT THEY'RE REALLY ACHIEVING. WE HAD A. ANALYSIS OF WHAT THEIR CARBON WAS PER DOLLAR AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. SO WHAT DID WE DO. THEY JUST CHANGE ADMINISTRATORS AND SAID WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT WITH THE NEXT ADMINISTRATOR. THE SAME THING WE'VE DONE ON THE BULLET TRAIN EVERY TIME IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S PERFORMANCE WE CHANGE THE DIRECTOR AND THE NEXT GUY'S GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND THEY DON'T FIX THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT POLICY. WHAT I'M GONN ASK YOU A QUESTION WHAT WAS THE WETTEST YEAR ON RECORD IN THIS. STATE OF CALIFORNIA I BET YOU DON'T KNOW. IN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO YEARS OF KEEPING RECORDS. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. DECEMBER AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EVERYWHERE THE WETTEST YEARS ON RECORD IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE IN A DROUGHT RIGHT NOW. OUR RESERVOIRS WERE A HUNDRED AND AGO. WHERE DID THE WATER GO. THIS ADMINISTRATION RELEASED THE WATER. BECAUSE THERE'S ENOUGH WATER IN OUR RESERVOIRS TO TAKE CALIFORNIA FOR FIVE YEARS. SO THERE'S A LOT OF POLICY THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED IN THIS PLACE AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE. HELD ACCOUNTABLE. RELEASING WATERS. AND NOT TAKING CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND NOT LAYING THE TRACK. AND THIS BILL IS GOING TO DO NOTHING MORE ADD TO THAT. MEMBERS FOR THE FUTURE OF MY FAMILY AND MY RANCH I ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS AND MANY OTHER BILLS UNLESS DO SOME POLICY AROUND HERE IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. IT ACTUALLY KEEPS BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. AND NOT SHIFTING OUR JOBS TO. CHINA WHERE THEY POLLUTE IT'S THE SAME ERROR. ALL COMPANIES COMPETE AGAINST ALL THESE OTHER COMPANIES I COMPETE AGAINST COMPANIES IN OREGON WASHINGTON AND NEVADA AND I'M GETTING. KILLED BECAUSE MY TOOLS A DOLLAR A GALLON MORE. BY REGULATIONS ARE SO MUCH MORE MY WAGES ARE SO MUCH MORE AT SOME POINT I CAN'T COMPETE. AND I THINK I'M A PRETTY GOOD FORMER. BUT AT SOME POINT IN THE LEGISLATURE'S CAUSING MY PROBLEMS MORE THAN ME. I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR HOLLINGS CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'M OBVIOUSLY I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK ON THIS FLOOR ABOUT THE CAREERS I'M NOT JUST GOING TO SAY JOBS BUT CAREERS THAT THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY PROVIDE TO MY DISTRICT BECAUSE THEIR LONG TERM CAREERS YOU KNOW TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS WHERE PEOPLE MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY. THEY HAVE GREAT BENEFITS- WE DO HAVE BOTH UNION AND NONUNION JOBS AND DEAL INDUSTRY IS CONSISTENT IN MAKING SURE THAT WAGES AND BENEFITS IS- IS A- MAKING SURE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES ARE TAKING CARE OF- THIS BILL. LIKE SO MANY OTHER BILLS THAT GO THROUGH- ATTACK OUR OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AND- I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIEBER WITH THE COMMENTS THAT HE SAID ABOUT FARMING BUT I ALSO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN THE BRICK BEAVER THAT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ON ABOUT HOW TO FIX THE ISSUE OF A- THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE WE DO THAT SMARTLY YOU KNOW WE REDUCED OIL PRODUCTION OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION HERE IN THE STATE AND- WE IMPORT ALMOST 70% OF OUR PRODUCT FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T REDUCED THE CONSUMPTION THE CALIFORNIANS EXPECT. I LISTEN TO A LOT OF COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND AND I WE GOT FIVE KIDS AND WE'RE ON OUR TENTH GRANDCHILD I HAVEN'T CAUGHT UP WITH MY SENATOR. A FRIEND COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA YET BUT- I GUARANTEE YOU MY CHILDREN ARE WORKING ON IT. M. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU KNOW I HAVE GRANDKIDS TO ANNA. MY GRANDKIDS I THINK ONE OF LUPUS WHICH YOU HAVE THE ELECTRICITY COME ON. WHEN THEY GET OLDER. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO COOK ON A STOVE INSIDE THE HOUSE AND NOT HAVE TO BUILD A FIRE. I THINK THE WAY THAT. THIS BODY IS APPROACHING CLIMATE CHANGE IS REALLY DETRIMENTAL. IT'S THROUGH OVER REGULATION. I CAN TELL YOU THAT- WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN ALL THE- THE BANNING OF LAWN MOWERS AND JUST EVERYTHING PLUS THIS. SOLUTION TO MAKE THAT WORK. AND FIX THAT. SO THAT THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE CAN CHECK OFF OUR LIST AND I THINK THAT WE COULD GET A LOT OF I AM FROM. FROM EVERYBODY. AT ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. I CAN TELL YOU THAT- I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY SAID BUT I'M JUST GETTING IN THIS WITH A VERY SIMPLE THING BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. YOU CAN SET THE GOAL YOU CAN MAKE THEIR SPEECHES YOU CAN USE THIS FOR SPEECHES AND CAMPAIGNS IN YOUR DISTRICT. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S UNATTAINABLE. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE I HAVE A LINE MIKE THOUGHTS WITH THE GOVERNOR OF THIS STATE TOO IS. REALLY AN ENVIRONMENTALIST. BUT LAST. MONTH HE HAD TO AUTHORIZE EMERGENCY USE FOR FIVE NEW GAS LINE GENERATORS TO BE BROUGHT ON LINE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS. SO WHEN THEY FLIP THE SWITCH THE LIGHT CAME ON. SO NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THAT IT'S NOT IN THE MEDIA. D. W. R. ACTUALLY THE- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES ANNOUNCED ON AUGUST SIXTEENTH VERY QUIETLY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO INSTALL FIVE NEW GAS POWERED GENERATORS. DUE TO ENERGY SUPPLY CONCERNS BECAUSE THEY ARE CALIFORNIANS THAT WE REPRESENT EXPECT. TO BE ABLE TO TURN ON THE AIR CONDITIONER WHEN IT'S A HUNDRED TEN DEGREES. AND THEY WANT THEIR AIR CONDITIONER TO COME ON THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE LIGHTS IF THEY NEED BREATHING TREATMENTS AT NIGHT THEY WANT THE POWER TO WORK. SO THAT THEY CAN USE THOSE BREEDING TREATMENTS. SO I THINK MOVING IN A DIRECTION OF. MOVING IN AND USING GREEN TECHNOLOGY LIKE ALL OF THE ABOVE ALL OF THE ABOVE BOILING GAS GREEN TECHNOLOGY. IN KERN COUNTY THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT THAT I SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES WE DO THAT WE PRODUCE 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN IT. IT OIL AND GAS SUPPLY AND WE ALSO PRODUCE 53% OF THE STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY. SO IT CAN BE DONE PEOPLE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER WE CAN SOLVE SOME PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE ALL AGREE THAT WE HAVE. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT ALL OF THIS. IN THIS BILL DOESN'T WORK YOU CAN SET THESE GOALS BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS NEED OIL AND GAS AND GAS POWERED GENERATORS. JUST LIKE THE COMIC YESTERDAY THEY CAME HOW IF YOU DON'T IF YOU IF YOU CAN'T PLUG IN A BATTERY OPERATED GENERATOR TO RUN YOUR- YOUR KEEP YOUR REFRIGERATOR COLD. BUT YOU KNOW HOW YOU CHARGE THAT RIGHT IF IT DOESN'T HAVE GAS. INTO ELIMINATE THOSE TYPES OF J. THE RAIDERS WHICH I NOTED. BUT THAT WAS A BILL THAT WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY ANYWAYS- SO I WENT DOWN A RABBIT HOLE SORRY DIDN'T MEAN TO. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES JUST AUTHORIZED- THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY GAVIN NEWSOM JUST AUTHORIZED. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO PUT FIVE GAS POWERED. PLANTS IN PLACE IMMEDIATELY. IMMEDIATELY UNDER EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION BECAUSE WE NEED POWER NOW. AND WE HAVE TO HAVE THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE IT. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THE CENTER GROVE CENTER HERTZBERG. VERY FEW MEN A PRESENTATION- I LEFT GOVERNMENT OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND SPENT MORE THAN TWELVE YEARS TRAVELING THE WORLD WORKING IN. THE AREA OF CLEAN TECH IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO. ALWAYS WAS AT ODDS WITH SO MANY FRIENDS I WOULD ALWAYS SAY HOW MANY POUNDS OF CARBON DID YOU PRODUCE. IN THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THE FIRST TEN YEARS AFTER. AB THIRTY TWO WHICH PRODUCED A LOT OF THE ASIAN. A LOT OF RULES AND REGULATIONS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK. GLOBALLY IS WHAT THE IMPACT WAS EVEN COMPARED AGAINST CHINA OR GERMANY OR SO MANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS OF THE MALDIVES. WHERE WERE WE IN TERMS OF THAT POLICY WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY DO TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT BEYOND JUST THE RHETORIC OF THAT. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT. IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO JUST READ. A COUPLE LINES FROM IT. IT SAYS THE SEPARATELY. THAT THE STATE BOARD. HELLO JENNIFER HI- IN ROOM FIVE YOUR GREENHOUSE GASES BEGIN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND PAGE FIVE IN THE PARAGRAPH NINE INCHES BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THE BOARD SHALL EVALUATE FEASIBILITY IN TRADE OFF. WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW WE HAVE A CLIMATE EMERGENCY. THE LOWER CLIMATE CHANGE I SAID YESTERDAY ITS CLIMATE CHANGED. WHAT WE DID YESTERDAY FOR FAMILIES ON EXTREME HEAT A FRIEND OF MINE GOOD FRIEND OF MINE JUST TOLD ME A STORY. WHO GREW UP IN MY DISTRICT IN COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT. THAT SHE USED TO PUT A SOCK IN THE FREEZER. SHE LIVES IN A TRAILER. AND SO THAT YOU CAN PUT IN A HEADER STOMACH ISSUE SO. SO HOT. THAT WAS THE THING SHE HAD TO DO TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE WE HAVE THESE EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES AND JUST YESTERDAY THE SENATE. WITH THE LEADERSHIP. ALL THROUGHOUT THE COMMITTEES THE BUDGET. BASICALLY HAVE DONE THAT EXTREME HEAT ON FIRES ON OUR ON THE ISSUE OF URBAN FORESTRY THINGS THAT WILL IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES NOW. THE LAST THING I WANT TO SHARE. IS THAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS DELEGATE TO KERR. OKAY WHAT HAPPENED BACK WAY BACK WHEN WE GET A B. THIRTY TWO. WAS PEOPLE COULDN'T AGREE SO LET'S GIVE IT TO AN AGENCY. AND SO ALL WE'RE DOING IS TAKING AUTHORITY FROM THE BRILLIANCE THERE IN THIS ROOM AND THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE PASSION ON THIS ISSUE AND CARE DEEPLY. AND WE'RE PASSING TO THE AGENCY AND LET ME TELL YOU LASTLY ONE EXAMPLE. THAT MYSELF THE SENATOR FROM MENLO PARK IN THE SENATOR FROM. FREMONT WENT AND MET WITH CARBON. AND WE ASKED THEM TO RESPOND TO AN ISSUE THAT WE CARED ABOUT THE SENATOR'S. INVOLVING CAP AND TRADE AND YOU KNOW WHAT. WE HAVEN'T HAD A RESPONSE. SO HERE WE ARE IF SENATORS WHO WE ARE AS LEGISLATORS AND WE'RE SAYING WE WANT TO SOLVE THIS URGENT PROBLEM. WE'RE SENDING IT OUT YEARS AND INTO THE FUTURE AND WE'RE GIVING IT TO AN AGENCY. THAT JUST IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WOULD NOT EVEN RESPOND TO CINDERS REQUEST TO KURT DEEPLY ABOUT THESE ISSUES. I AM COMMITTED TO THE CAUSE I AM GOING TO PUT EVERYBODY GOT IT I HAVE INTO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS IS THIS. GREAT SENATE HAS DONE WITH RESPECT TO ITS RESOURCES PROGRAM THE BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US HERE TODAY SOLVES. THOSE PROBLEMS BEYOND THE RHETORIC. THANK YOU SENT HER. CENTER BATES. RELEVANT I WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK ON THE BILL BUT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT CAUGHT MY EYE IN THE HOUSE FLOOR ALERT AND- LET ME PREFACE THAT WITH- I GIVE A ABOUT THE CLIMATE CHANGE I GIVE A ABOUT THE PLANET AND I GIVE A ABOUT THE PRESENCE IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IN TERMS OF JOBS SO THIS PARTICULAR ITEM IN THE FLOOR ALERT CAUGHT MY EYE IT SAYS AMENDMENTS WERE PROMISED IN COMMITTEE. TO BE CONCERNS OF WORKING FAMILIES THAT WERE NEVER ADDED TO THE BILL WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM HERE WITH THE BILL IS THERE'S NO BALANCE THERE'S NO DELIBERATE UP PROGRESS IN IN ADDRESSING ALL OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS WE HAVEN'T MET THE TARGETS AND THAT'S IN A LOT OF THE MATERIALS WE'VE BEEN PRESENTED WE ARE. SORELY CONCERNED ABOUT MEETING EVEN THOUGH OF THE NINETEEN THE TWO THOUSAND OF THE 40% THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AND BY TWENTY ODD THIRTY SO. THERE'S TIME HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY A NUMBER OF OTHER PRESENTERS THAT ALL THIS AS A TWO YEAR DEAL MAYBE THESE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD HELP BRING THE BALANCE FOR THE PRESENT AND THE NEED FOR JOBS AS WE GO FORWARD A BASICALLY FOR OUR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN OR GREAT GRANDCHILDREN SO I WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY EVEN THOUGH I AM NOT A DENIER ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND SPECIALLY LIVING ON THE COAST. I SEE SEE RIDER SO I JUST RECOMMEND THAT WE TAKE MORETIME WE GET MORE RESPONSIBILITY ON MY ARM THE CARD REGULATIONS THAT ARE JUST YOU KNOW DECIDED THERE VOTED THERE AND- PROMULGATED ON OUR INDUSTRY IS THAT SOME OF THAT COME BACK TO US FOR A REVIEW FULL BECAUSE OF THOSE ISSUES I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. BUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO BELIEVE THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO BE INVOLVED IN- IN OUR LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES CENTER MELINDA'S. THANK YOU SO MUH. THE SENATORS. TO THE CAR FROM THE AIR. CALIFORNIA EMITTED JUST IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED AND SIX MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON. JUST THREE FIRES ALONE. THAT'S IT SO THAT'S ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE ENTIRE CARBON EMISSIONS ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES. FOR THE VERY SAME YEAR. BUT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH POLICIES LIKE THIS TO PUSH MORE INDUSTRIES OUT OF OUR STATE TO PUSH MORE JOBS OUT OF OUR STATE. HE'S LIKE THIS DO. THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE A BIT SELF PROCLAIMED ENVIRONMENTALIST HAVING DONE NOTHING TO REALLY PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU JUST BECAUSE YOU STAND UP ON THE FLOOR AND TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH OF AN ENVIRONMENTALIST YOU ARE AND SHED A TEAR IN DECIDE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE MONOPOLY ON- PROTECTING THE PLANET THAT DOESN'T FLY BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING ISN'T PROTECTING THE PLANT WHAT IT IS DOING. IS RUNNING PEOPLE OUT OF THE STATE THIS IS A GOOD POLICY THOUGH THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT POLICIES WITHIN THIS ONE BILL AND I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT IS BUT IT NEEDS TO BE CERTAINLY MORE FOCUSED AND IT IN. IT IT CERTAINLY NEEDS TO BE TONED DOWN DRASTICALLY ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER MELINDA'S ANY FURTHER COMMENTS CONSPIRED TO BAIT SEEING AND HEARING NINE CENTER LAYERED YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT AND LET ME THANK. ALL OUR COLLEAGUES FOR WHAT I THINK WAS A VERY VERY GOOD DEBATE IT IS CLEAR. FROM THE DEBATE THE TWO COMPLEXITY OF ADDRESSING ISSUES OF CLIMATE- IS INTENSE AND THAT GOING FORWARD WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT CAME UP. BUT WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US NOW IS THIS AND GIVEN A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS JUST SAID THIS IS NOT A BINARY CHOICE BETWEEN ADDRESSING FIRE AND DOING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SEPARATELY WE TOOK AMAZING ACTION ON CLIMATE EARLIER THIS WEEK WITH REGARD TO FIRE WITH REGARD TO THE DROUGHT WITH REGARD TO THE- ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY POLICIES WE ACTED. AND WE ALSO. ARE ACTING ON EMISSIONS AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE JUST BEFORE WE CAME BACK FROM THE RECESS I VISITED- EIGHT EIGHT A PLANT IN MY DISTRICT IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST BATTERY STORAGE PLANTS AND WAS A FORM OF FOSSIL FUEL PLANT. AND THERE ARE I WAS GIVEN A TOUR BY WORK FOR OVER FORTY YEARS SERVICE OF FOSSIL FUEL WORKER FOR THIRTY YEARS AND NOW COULD EXPLAIN TO ME EVERYTHING ABOUT BATTERY STORAGE.

THESE THIS MEASURE REQUIRES REPAIR RESOURCE FOR TO WORK WITH LABOR AGENCIES TO UPDATE FUNDING GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THAT APPLICANTS USE FEAR AND RESPECT RESPONSIBLE STANDARDS TO PROMOTE HIGH QUALITY JOBS INCLUSIVE PROCUREMENT AND THE PREVAILING WAGE OF CONSTRUCTION ON- FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. CALIFORNIA LIKES TO INSERT ITSELF AS WE HEARD IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN A GOAL GOAL GLOBAL LEADER WHEN IT COMES TO COMBATING. CLIMATE CHANGE BUT- THAT WORK CUTS BOTH WAYS HOWEVER THERE IS A GROWING EVIDENCE THAT OUR CLIENT CLIMATE CHANGE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT GOING TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THEM THE MOST. THEY ARE BEING IGNORED AND- THIS IS SOME OF THE GREAT CONCERNS ON JUNE TWENTY TWENTY. A REPORT FROM UCLA CENTER FOR SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES FOUND THAT THE STRUCTURE OF OUR PLANNED INVESTMENTS IS SKEWED TO BENEFIT MORE OF THE FOLLOWING COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE AND OUR WORKING CLASS AND ARE POOR. AN AUDIT BY CAR WHICH I RECORD SET LAST YEAR AND REPORTED BACK THIS YEAR THAT MANY OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS. REDUCTION PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT FAILED TO ACHIEVE ANY MEANINGFUL EQUITABLE OR MEASURABLE OUTCOMES GOALS THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNING TO ALL OF US THESE VALUES TO COME TO AT THE EXPENSE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. DESPITE BEING THE POSTER CHILD FOR MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS. THIS BILL WILL CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN OUR INTENTIONS AND OUR OUTCOMES FOR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND SPENDING.

PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS PRESERVING ENDANGERED SPECIES AND STRENGTHENING OUR STATE'S TRADE AND TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WHILE SHE WAS KNOWN FOR HER LOVE OF EDUCATION SHE WAS ALSO A ZEALOUS ADVOCATE. FOR STUDENTS OF CIVIL RIGHTS.

LONG STORY SHORT AN IMAGE TAKEN IN THE SIMPLY CLARIFY LANGUAGE AT REGARDING ACCESS RELATED TO COMMAND POST TO FULLY ALIGN THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WITH EXISTING LAW WHERE THERE IS NO UNFETTERED ACCESS TO COMMAND POST TODAY. IN ADDITION IT CLARIFIES THAT PROTECTION FROM ARREST UNDER PENAL CODE ONE FORTY EIGHT WILL ONLY APPLY TO MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA WHEN THEY'RE GATHERING RECEIVING OR PROCESSING INFORMATION THIS. BILL COMES BACK TO US WITHIN MINUTES ALSO THAT CLARIFIES THAT THE BILL SHOULD NOT BE A BASIS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY. WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I DON'T. THANK YOU SENATOR MIKE. MEMBERS TO. OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER GORGEOUS. SORRY ANOTHER QUESTION FOR THE OFFICE PLEASE SEND REQUIRE WE TAKE A QUESTION YES HIM THINKING THIS WOULD BE THE AMENDMENT HERE'S THAT. THE ASSEMBLY DELETED LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE NEWS ENTITIES RECEIVE AUTHORIZATION FROM A COMMANDING OFFICER ON SCENE BEFORE ENTERING CLOSED AREAS. I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU WOULD BE. DID WE FINE TUNE THE DEFINITION OF THOSE THAT ARE IN THE MEDIA. I THINK WE DEALT WITH THIS BEFORE YEAH BUT YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TOM DICK AND HARRY CAN HAVE A FACEBOOK PAGE IN TWELVE FOLLOWERS AND CALL THEMSELVES AN OUTLET. AND BEFORE MOVING INTO A DYNAMIC AND DANGEROUS SITUATION NORMALLY ALLOWING. MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA TO PARTICIPATE. DID WE EVER FIND TUNE WHAT IT IS TO BE A MEMBER OF AUTHORIZED MEDIA. OR RECOGNIZE MEDIA SO THERE IS NO FEDERAL DEFINITION OF AUTHORIZED MEDIA THERE IS NO STATE DEFINITION OF AUTHORIZED MEDIA. IN WHAT WE KNOW. OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. DURING A SERIES OF PROTESTS RALLIES. THERE'VE BEEN A RECORD NUMBER OF JOURNALISTS WHO HAVE BEEN. APPREHENDED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCOSTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEY HAD BEEN. BEATEN BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND UNFAIRLY ARRESTED. SO THERE IS NOT A FORMAL DEFINITION BOTH ON THE FEDERAL AS WELL AS THE STATE LEVELS AND THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO ALLOW THE PRESS TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO DO UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT. AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON MY OWN TIME I WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT SOME MUNICIPALITY IN FACT THE MOST MUNICIPALITIES OR EVEN COUNTING IS. CREATE A PRESS POOL MEANING THAT THEY ARE A RECOGNIZED MEMBER OF A- RECOGNIZED PRESS OUTLET. AND I'M WONDERING AND UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. IS THE RESPECTIVE JURISDICTION USING THE MUNICIPALITY OR THE COUNTY DESIGNATION. OF AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NEWS OUTLETS. THIS BILL IN NO WAY PROHIBITS LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE SCENE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A CALL ON WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE PRESS AND WHO IS NOT. AT SO- WOULD ENCOURAGE IN AND I'M NOT ALL SEEN THIS TO THE GOOD SENATOR AT ALL BUT THIS BILL. DOES NOT DEFINE. WHAT AND WHO A MEMBER OF THE PRESS IS. BUT IT ALSO DOES NOT PRECLUDE LAW ENFORCEMENT. FROM INSURING THAT THE PRESS ARE SAFE IN ADDITION- IT DOES NOT. DETERMINE DETERMINE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT- DOES NOT PREDETERMINE HOOP AND MEMBER OF THE PRESS IS NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO- INSURERS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT STILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE PRESS ALONG IF NEED BE BASED OFF OF PUBLIC SAFETY. IS THAT PRECLUDE THAT FROM THAT HI IN THIS BILL. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR YES PLEASE HE WILL ACCEPT THE QUESTION THANK YOU ACCORDING TO THE OPPOSITION THE CALIFORNIA PETE POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION GIVES A SCENARIO THIS IS BASICALLY FOR EXAMPLE IMAGINE A SITUATION IT TURNS VIOLENT DUE TO THE DANGER IN THE SPECIFIC AREA CLOSE TO THE PUBLIC NOW UNDER SB NINETY EIGHT ANY PERSON CLAIMING TO BE A REPRESENTATIVE THE NEW SERVICE WEB ACCESS TO THAT RESTRICTED AREA YOU WILL INHIBIT- POLICE OFFICERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO KEEP THOSE INDIVIDUAL SAFE BUT THE COMMENT THAT YOU JUST MADE CAN YOU REITERATE THAT. OR CAN YOU REPEAT THAT BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA BE WORKING THESE. SITUATIONS ON THE GROUND- THEY THINK THAT THIS ONE HIT THEM FOR PROTECTING PEOPLE AND KEEPING THEM SAFE MEANING THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND THAT ACTUALLY DO THE WORK THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. SO WE WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS BUT THIS BILL IS BACK IN FRONT OF US- AFTER JUST BEING CANDID WITH HIS BODY THAT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR WE TOOK THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED IN THAT MEDIA MESSAGE SERIOUSLY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH- ALL SIDES ON THIS ISSUE. TO ENSURE THAT IT'S GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL BUT HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT ALLOWS PRESS TO HAVE THE SAME FREEDOM. AS THEY ALREADY ARE ALLOWED IN LAW DURING THE TIME OF NATURAL DISASTER. FIRE FLOOD EARTHQUAKE. WE'RE NOT CHECKING PRESS CREDENTIALS IN FACT WE ALLOW PRESSED TO BE ABLE TO GO BEHIND FIRE LINES WE ALLOW. JOURNALISTS TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB TO BE ABLE TO COVER EARTHQUAKES IN THIS SIMPLY TAKES THAT DEFINITION. IT PUTS IT TOWARDS IN IMPLEMENTS IT FOR FIRST AMENDMENT DEMONSTRATIONS THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE LEADING THE WAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROTECTION. OF PRESS FREEDOM IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATE THE STATISTICS. THE ONES THAT NEED TO BE PROTECTED AT THIS MOMENT. THE ONES THAT NEED TO BE PROTECTED IN THIS NATION IN THE STATE ARE THE JOURNALISTS THEY ARE BEING UNFAIRLY ARRESTED. THEY'RE BEING ACCOSTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT A MINORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT I MIGHT ADD. BUT LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATISTICS ACROSS THIS NATION OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. JOURNALISTS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE PUTTING THEMSELVES IN DANGER TIME IN AND TIME OUT COVERING FIRST AND THEN THE DEMONSTRATIONS. PROVIDING THE PUBLIC THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED AND CANDIDLY. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME RED HERRINGS OUT THERE SOMEONE WITH A CELL PHONE FROM FACEBOOK IS GOING TO BE- SAY THAT THEY'RE A REPORTER. THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE A LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO. MOVE THAT INDIVIDUAL LONG I CAN REALLY FEEL THAT THAT IS A RED HERRING ARGUMENT I'VE HEARD IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I HAVE GREAT RESPECT BY THE WAY. FOR THE SENATOR IN LOVE WORKING WITH HER BUT I. I DID SIMPLY DON'T SEE THAT IN FACT I SEE THE OPPOSITE WHERE JOURNALISTS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE PUTTING THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE BEING ACCOSTED UNFAIRLY DETAINED ARRESTED AND CANDIDLY SUMMER BEING BEATEN SHOT WITH RUBBER BULLETS IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL HAT THIS. LEGISLATURE PASSES BILL. THANK YOU AM I MY OWN TO MAYBE SHE'S READING THE LETTERS OF OPPOSITION FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE ON THE GROUND AND THAT'S WHAT POSE THOSE QUESTIONS. AND THEY ALSO SAY THAT CURRENT LOTTERY ALREADY GIVES DULY AUTHORIZED ME PERSONAL ACCESS TO THESE EVENTS. SB NINETY EIGHT ADDS A VAGUE NEW STATUTE THAT CREATES A NEW VIOLATION THAT OVER IT'S OVERLY BROAD. ACCORDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT CUT IS. BOUND FOR COSTLY LITIGATION. AND SO I'D RECOMMEND A NO VOTE AND THEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO JUST- WITH DEEP RESPECT TO THE- TO THE AUTHOR. YOU KNOW LIKE I LOVE WORKING WITH HIM TOO. AND IN THE LAST FEW DAYS WE'VE LIMITED PRESS- YOU KNOW. ROGER VERITAS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT GO UNDER COVER AND GET INFORMATION AND THAT. YOU KNOW SO I THINK THAT THIS BODY TENDS TO PROTECT SOME SPEECH THAT THEY LIKE BUT NOT SPEECH THAT THEY DON'T LIKE. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS COMPLETELY AGAINST THIS BILL BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE IT JEOPARDIZES THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CLAIMING TO BE PRESS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NEVER. FENDER KAMMERER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT QUESTION FOR THE OFFICE. WILL YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION YES MA'AM HE WILL. WITH DEEP APOLOGIES I HAVE TO SAY THAT- I WA NOT ABLE TO HEAR ALL OF THE RESPONSES THAT YOU- GAVE EARLIER BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW I AM IN THE BACK AND SOMETIMES IT IS HARD TO HEAR- I RECEIVED. SO MANY CALLS FROM CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT ABOUT SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN ON THIS SIDE OF THE AISLE BEFORE IT- MOVED OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE- AND MANY OF THEM WERE. DISMAYED TO SAY THE LEAST AND SO I HAVE RE READ THE BILL WHILE I WAS LISTENING TO. SOME OF YOUR RESPONSES AND STATEMENTS WHICH HAS PROBABLY ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THIS QUESTION I WAS JUST HOPING THAT YOU COULD REITERATE- THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE- AND WHERE THIS STILL STANDS- JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH CONCERN. ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE- AND HOW THAT WOULD IMPACT ON JOURNALISTS IN THEIR EFFORT TO- TO BE ABLE TO COVER PROTESTS EXTRATERRESTRIAL. IT WOULD JUST FOR MY ADORATION IF YOU COULD- REPEAT OME OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE NOW BEEN MADE AND ARE INCORPORATED IN THE BILL THANK YOU THE COMMAND CENTER. THE FIRST AND FOREMOST WHEN THIS BILL STARTED THERE WAS A MISDEMEANOR IN THE BILL. THAT WAS AMENDED OUT. THEN THERE WAS A FINE IN THE BILL THAT'S FINE FOR. ILLEGALLY ARRESTING JOURNALISTS FOR BEATING A JOURNALIST. THAT WAS AMENDED OUT THERE WE CLARIFIED LANGUAGE RELATED TO COME COMMAND TALKS TO FULLY ALIGN THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WITH EXISTING LAW. THEN WE NEEDED ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO BE ABLE TO CLARIFY THAT PROTECTIONS FROM THE REST UNDER PENAL CODE WILL ONLY APPLY TO MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA WHEN THEY'RE GATHERING RECEIVING OR PROCESSING INFORMATION THEN WE ARE ASKED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL ON THEM TO CLARIFY THE BILL CANNOT BE A BASIS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY ON TOP OF ALREADY TAKING THE MISDEMEANOR OUT OF THE BILL. THEN WE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO ADD INTENT LANGUAGE TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE COURT SAID IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE COURT AND THE COURTS TO INTERPRET SP NINETY EIGHT TO AFFORD THE SAME MEDIA PROTECTIONS PROVIDED UNDER EXISTING LAW THAT'S THE LAW THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT NOW WHERE. A JOURNALIST MEDIUM MEMBERS OF THEPRESS HAVE FREEDOM WHEN IT COMES TO NATURAL DISASTERS IN THE STATE I WILL TELL YOU WE HAVE WORKED HARD WE WORK WITH JOURNALISTS UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPERS ASSOCIATION TO BE ABLE TO BRING CONSENSUS ON THIS BILL. AND I JUST WANT TO- INDEED HERE OBVIOUSLY HAPPY TO TAKE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE DATA. THAT'S IN FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW. SIX HUNDRED INCIDENTS SIX HUNDRED INCIDENTS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. OF AGGRESSIONS AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE PRESS TO DO THEIR JOBS TO COVER FIRST INTIMATE DEMONSTRATIONS. IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT MEMBERS OF THE PRESS LITERALLY RISK THEIR LIVES EACH AND EVERY DAY TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER. FAIR AND ACCURATE NEWS TO THE PUBLIC HERE IN THIS STATE THIS LOSS SIMPLY TAKES WHAT'S ALREADY IN LAW FOR NATURAL DISASTERS IN TRANSITION TO. GIVE EQUITY TOWARDS. ENSURING THE JOURNALISTS HAVE UNFETTERED ACCESS DURING FIRST AND THEN THE DEMONSTRATIONS IT ALREADY HAPPENS IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY. AND I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS FINALLY THE CONCERNS- THAT WE CONTINUE TO HEAR ABOUT NUMBER ONE. WE KEEP HEARING THAT JOURNALISTS ARE GOING TO HAVE UNFETTERED ACCESS TO MOBILE COMMAND POST. THAT'S MALARKEY. I NEED A- MEMBER OF THE PRESS CAN'T WALK INTO A POLICE STATION HAVE HAVE UNFETTERED ACCESS. TO A POLICE STATION SAME THING IS GOING TO BE FOR MOBILE COMMAND POST SECONDLY AGAIN WE REMOVE THE MISDEMEANOR IN THIS BILL AND THEN FINALLY. WE KEEP HEARING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WON'T BE ABLE TO REMOVE MALICIOUS NUMBER THE PRESS WAS OBSTRUCTING LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRST OF ALL AGAIN IT'S A RED HERRING. WELL WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT SITUATION. WE'VE DOCUMENTED CASES OF POLICE ARRESTING THE MEDIA IN THIS BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE BLANKET IMMUNITY ONE MORE TIME THIS BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE BLANKET IMMUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PRESS TO INTENTIONALLY OBSTRUCT ONE FORCING. ONE MORE TIME DOES NOT PROVIDE BLANKET IMMUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PRESS THAT INTENTIONALLY OBSTRUCT LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK IN THIS NATION. WE HAVE TO LEAD THIS NATION FOR PROTECTIONS OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN I ARCHULETA HI ATKINS I FACE.

SEVEN OR EIGHT MEN HAS HELD TWO OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT WITH INPUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDERS HOSPITALS PATIENTS FAMILIES AND MORE. THROUGH THOSE HEARINGS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL DATA AND ANECDOTES IT BECAME CLEAR THAT SOME WELL INTENTIONED ASPECTS OF THE LAW SERVE AS BARRIERS FOR TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS. INTERESTED IN ACCESSING THE OPTION AFTER FIVE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION THE CURRENT PROCESS TO OBTAIN MEDICAL AID IN DYING DRUGS IS UNNECESSARILY CUMBERSOME. CONTAINING TOO MANY ROADBLOCKS FOR MANY DYING PATIENTS. AS THREE THREE EIGHTY WOULD MAKE SEVERAL IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE END OF LIFE OPTION AT.

AS WELL AS THE REINSTATEMENT OF A SUNSET DATE EXTENDED TO TWENTY THIRTY ONE TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL DATA TO BE COLLECTED ON THE CHANGES SP THREE EIGHTY MAKES TO THE END OF LIFE OPTIONS ACT. THE CORE PROTECTIONS BUILT INTO THE LAW HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE EFFECTIVE. THERE BEEN NO REPORTED INSTANCES OF ABUSE OR COERCION.

MY SELF IN THE REPUBLICAN LEADER I WANTED TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY AND RISE TODAY TO ASK THAT WE ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF MRS DONNA CANNELLA. WHO PASSED AWAY ON TUESDAY THIS PAST TUESDAY SEPTEMBER SEVENTH AT THE YOUNG AGE OF SEVENTY EIGHT. DONNA WAS THE BELOVED MOTHER OF A FORMER MEMBER OF THIS BODY CALIFORNIA STATE SENATOR ANTHONY CANNELLA WHO REPRESENTED THE TWELFTH DISTRICT FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SHE WAS ALSO THE WIFE OF FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAL CANNELLA WHO REPRESENTED PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE TWO WERE MARRIED FOR FIFTY SEVEN YEARS AND THEIRSWAS A RELATIONSHIP BUILT ON LOVE ADMIRATION AND SUPPORT OF ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR FAMILY. DONNA'S FAMILY WAS AT THE CENTER OF HER HEART AND ALL THAT SHE DID IT IN RETURN HER FAMILY WHICH INCLUDES HER THREE CHILDREN NICOLE ANTHONY AND VINCENT AND NINE GRAND CHILDREN FILLED HER LIFE WITH JOY. DONNA WAS A RESPECTED COMFORTING FIGURE IN THE SERIES COMMUNITY AND HER ABILITY TO PUT OTHERS AT EASE NOT ONLY AIDED HER IN HER WORK IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. BUT ALSO WAS A TRUSTED FOUNDATION FOR HER HUSBAND IN HIS ROLE AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. DONNA IS A TESTAMENT TO WHAT IT MEANS TO LOVE WITH YOUR WHOLE HEART INTO THE SELFLESS SACRIFICE THAT SO MANY OF OUR SPOUSES GIVE THOSE OF US WHO WORK IN PUBLIC SERVICE. DONNA'S PASSING WILL LEAVE A VOID IN THE CANAL OF FAMILY. BUT HER MEMORY WILL NEVER FADE NOR WILL THE LOVE SHE SHARED OVER THESE MANY YEARS.

AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC RECENT AMENDMENTS REMOVE ALL OPPOSITION AND EVEN MOVE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND OTHERS OF THE OPPOSITION COALITION TO A SUPPORT POSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPO. THANK YOU CEREMONY MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BUT WHEN I READ IT DURING OUR BREAK AT. WAS VERY PERPLEXED AND I HAD SOME QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. THE MOON WE TAKE A QUESTION. PLEASE PROCEED. I SUPPORT THE BILL LET'S GO THERE BUT I WAS KIND OF CURIOUS- IT SAYS IF YOU LOOK- AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHY- LET ME EXPLAIN WHY SO SIX EIGHTY FIVE LAST YEAR TOOK A GUARD. OR A MACHINE REGARD- CODE SECTION OUT OF THE OSHA TITLE EIGHT AND IT WEAPONIZED COUPLE OF IT SO THAT AND IN THE SAME MANNER THAT CAL OSHA COULD GO INTO A MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND SHUT DOWN. AGAIN A BAD PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT DID NOT HAVE A PROPER GARDEN PLACE. HURTING SOMEBODY CUTTING FF A FINGER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THEY COULD IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THAT FACILITY THE USE OF THAT PARTICULAR- CODE SECTION TO WEAPONIZE CODED AND TURN IT INTO A REPORTING REQUIREMENT. DISK CLEANUP BILL KIND OF GOT MY ATTENTION AND THE REASON WHY. IS BECAUSE IT CHANGED THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS- IN SPORTS TO DATE YOU KNOW WHATEVER WAS LATTER SO BASICALLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS INSTEAD OF SAME DAY. BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF EXEMPTIONS SO THE EXEMPTION ON THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. R. A. HEALTH FACILITY THAT'S ONE THIRTY EIGHT PAGE SEVEN. ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE PAGE EIGHT SECTION TO A COMMUNITY CLINIC SECTION FOR A TRAVEL CLINIC IS EXEMPT AN INDIAN TRIBE OR TRIBAL ORGANIZATION A REAL HEALTH CARE CLINIC A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER A CHRONIC DIALYSIS CENTER. EIGHT EIGHT THE EMPLOYER THAT PROVIDES HEALTH CARE. AN EMPLOYER THAT PROVIDES ADULT HEALTH CENTERS HEALTH CARE HEALTH CARE AGENCY A PEDIATRIC DAY CARE HEALTH RESPITE FACILITY A HOSPICE FACILITY RESIDENTIAL FACILITY WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY FOR PERSONS WITH CHRONIC LIFE THREATENING ILLNESSES A RESIDENTIAL FACILITY FOR THE ELDERLY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES A CHILD DAY CARE FACILITY IN THE LIST GOES ON. MY QUESTION IS THAT- ARE THESE VISIBILITY IS EXEMPT FROM THE REPORTING PERIOD. SECTION B. THAT REQUIRES OTHER EMPLOYERS REPORT WITH FORTY EIGHT HOURS. SO I WILL HAVE TO GET YOU THAT CONCRETE ANSWER OF IT SINCE I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME AND- I AM CERTAINLY HAPPY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT GETS BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU AND I AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT ASKING FOR ASKING THE QUESTION THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW I MEAN I REALIZE THAT YOU'RE JUST- MANAGING FOR MANAGING THE BILL YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET THIS INFORMATION. THE PREVIOUS BILL FROM LAST TO REQUIRE THESE ENTITIES WHETHER YOU'RE AN EMPLOYER AN EMPLOYER TO REPORT TO YOUR LOCAL AND REPORT TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THEN YOU'D REPORT CAL OSHA. OSHA THREE HUNDRED LOG WHICH IS REQUIRED BY EMPLOYERS FOR INJURIES IT WASN'T ON OCEAN THREE N. LIKE THAT SIMILAR REPORTING THE SAME DAD WAS THE SAME- FOR THE SOCIAL IT WASN'T ON OCEAN THREE HUNDRED LOG ME MAKE THAT CLEAR IT WAS THE SAME DATA REQUIRED FOR AN OSHA THREE HUNDRED LOG. TO REPORT AND INDEED DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS OR THE CALIFORNIA CODE DATA WEB BASED WOULD TRACK ALL THIS INFORMATION- BY INDUSTRY. AND THE REASON WHY IT WAS SO CURIOUS TO ME THAT WOULD. EXEMPT ALL OF THESE- THE SICK WHICH I'M VERY GLAD WE ARE WE DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S HARD TO MAINTAIN FOR ANY EMPLOYER AND I COULD IMAGINE THESE EMPLOYERS. SO FROM JANUARY FIRST TILL NOW THERE WERE FORTY SMALL PRINT JUST ONE SECOND. FROM JANUARY FIRST TO ANOTHER 430-008-0040 EIGHT REPORTED CASES. WHEN YOU TAKE THESE FACILITIES OUT THERE ARE HIGHLIGHTED ON THIS REPORT FORM. THAT ARE IN THIS BILL THAT EXAM. WE DROP OUR CASE REPORTING TO NINE THOUSAND CASES OF COVE IT. SO JUST IT PEAKED MY CURIOSITY OF WHY. WE WOULD REPORT THOSE CASES AND IT WOULD REDUCE OUR NUMBER OF KOBE CASES. ALMOST INSTANTLY AS SOON AS THE GOVERNOR BUT HIS SIGNATURE. ON THIS BILL SO THAT WAS MY CURIOUS POINT. I SUPPORT THE BILL I ASKED FOR AND I VOTE BUT THAT DIDN'T PIQUE MY CURIOSITY. THANK YOU AND I WILL- FOLLOW UP IN FACT IF. YES THANK YOU CENTER GROVE THANK YOU CENTER THE MON SENATOR PAM THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY SIX FIFTY FOUR- I WOULD MAKE A NOTE THAT- THE FACILITIES DESCRIBED BY MY GOOD FRIEND FROM BAKERSFIELD. ACTUALLY HAVE OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW SO IN MANY WAYS THE SANCTIONS HAVE TO DO WITH NOT HAVING DUPLICATE REPORTING SINCE THEY ACTUALLY FALL UNDER- THEY HAVE REPORTING pPLACES AND SO WITH THAT- I THINK AT LEAST TO ME IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE WE DON'T REDUCE DUPLICATION- STRICTLY ASPEN EITHER. THANK YOU SENATOR PENN CENTER GROVE MADAM PRESIDENT I LIKE THINK TO GET SENATOR FROM SACRAMENTO FOR PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION TO ME- THAT WASN'T AVAILABLE IN THE BILL ITSELF AND- LIKE I SAID IT JUST PIQUES MY CURIOSITY AND I APPRECIATE THAT INFORMATION THANK YOU SIR.
