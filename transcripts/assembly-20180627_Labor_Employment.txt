THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT -- WE DO NOT QUITE YET HAVE A QUORUM -- WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT TODAY HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DAY WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE LIVER COMMUNITY -- AND THERE'S NO PLACE I'D RATHER BE THAN IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE BECAUSE LABOR FIGHTS FOR WORKING PEOPLE. IN THE STATE IN THIS COUNTRY AND ARE RESILIENT PEOPLE AND WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY AND SO WE ARE PROUD -- TO CHAIR A COMMITTEE THAT BEARS THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE OF LABOR CONTINUE TO FIGHT STAND SOLIDARITY ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LABOR -- IT SO WILL GET UNDERWAY -- WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH -- S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY THREE FOR SENATOR MITCHELL -- WE ARE READY AT WHEN YOU ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE ON THIS TO BROWN. ON AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I WAS GLAD I WAS IN THE HEARING ROOM TO HEAR YOUR REMARKS BECAUSE I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE. MEMBERS TODAY OPPOSITE IN SENATE BILL THIRTEEN FORTY THREE WHICH REQUIRES THAT EMPLOYERS WITH FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES PROVIDE TRAINING ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TO NON SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEES. THE WAY THAT NON SUPERVISOR EMPLOYEES ARE CURRENTLY INFORMED ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ESTHER POSTER. BUT THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO NON SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEES. A TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ONE STUDY FOUND THAT EVEN A THIRTY MINUTE TRAINING SAID RESULTED IN PARTICIPANTS BE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT HARASSMENT THAN THOSE WHO HAD NOT PARTICIPATED IN THE TRAINING ALL. WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THE DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN BUSINESS COST TO EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS EMPLOYEE SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE. WE'RE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH VESTED INTEREST TO DRAFT LANGUAGE THAT WILL ENSURE TEMPORARY AND SEASONAL EMPLOYEES WHO MAY BE AT A HIGHER RISK OF HARASSMENT. ALSO BE PROVIDED TRAINING. I'M GLAD TO HAVE WITH ME TODAY GINNY NANCY FOUNDER AND CEO OF HIM TRAIN. AND EVAN GOLDBERG REPRESENTING STATE COMPTROLLER BETTY WHO SPOTS IN THIS LEGISLATION. GREAT. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT BILL -- AGAIN MY NAME IS JAMIE AND SEE -- I AM A TWENTY PLUS YEAR LAWYER SPECIALIZING IN THESE ISSUES OF OF PROVIDING WORKPLACE HARASSMENT. BY SEEING THIS ISSUE FROM ALL SIDES I EVER PRESENTED EMPLOYEES REPRESENTED EMPLOYERS. I'VE BEEN AND I'VE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT MYSELF A FEW TIMES EARLY IN MY CAREER. OF ALL WHICH LED ME TO START. IT IS CURRENTLY A 45% CULTURE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY PROVIDING ONLINE EDUCATION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT BIAS IN ETHICS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT UP LEVELING PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING OF SKILLS. OF THOSE TOPICS HELP GRAY HEALTHIER WORKPLACE CULTURE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO PERHAPS COULD CONFINE MY MY COMMENTS TO FIVE POINTS -- TODAY AND STARTING WITH. WHY S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY THREE WILL MOVE US FORWARD SO. I THINK THAT IF WE WANT TO CREATE RESPECTFUL WORKPLACES WHICH IS I THINK A TERM USED IN THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT CODE CALLED NINE FORTY SUBJECTION QUE WERE ALL OF US HAVE ALL EMPLOYERS HAVE AN OBLIGATION FOR RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE. VAN MANDATING HARASSMENT TRAINING JUST FOR THE SUPERVISORS IS NOT ENOUGH TO GET A ENOUGH CRITICAL MOMENTUM TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THE CULTURE RIGHT SO THE MANAGERS ARE TYPICALLY ONE FOURTH OF AN ORGANIZATION -- AND YOU HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER EMPLOYEES THAT YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT INFLUENCING YOUR NOT AFFECTING. PLUS THOSE EMPLOYEES THE NON MANAGERS ARE THE ONES THAT TYPICALLY NEED THE SUPPORT THEIR LAST THEIR LESS EMPOWERED THEY'RE USUALLY MORE JUNIOR -- LESS SAVVY LESS INFORMED ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AND LESS EMPOWERED TO EFFECTUATE THEIR OWN SITUATIONS SO THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT REALLY NEED THE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE -- OF A PROGRAM LIKE EDUCATION AND AND GUIDANCE ON THESE ISSUES ALSO. PROVIDING EDUCATION TO THOSE EMPLOYEES IDEALLY SHOULD JUST BE TAILORED TO THEIR NEEDS SO MANAGERS HAVE A WHOLE SEPARATE SET OF OBLIGATIONS. OF REFLECTING THEIR MANAGERIAL DUTIES AND THAT'S WHY IT AB. EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE MANDATED TO OUR PROGRAM. AS EMPLOYEE YOU NEED A LOT LESS THAN THAN THAT INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUGGESTING A ONE HOUR PROGRAM TAILORED TO THEIR NEEDS. SECONDLY S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY THREE IT WILL EXPAND THE THE TRAINING MANDATE. TO EMPLOYERS WHICH JUST FIVE EMPLOYEES -- AND CURRENTLY IT'S EMPLOYERS WITH FIFTY EMPLOYEES AND I THINK THIS IS HELPFUL BECAUSE THESE SMALL BUSINESSES THE EMPLOYERS WERE JUST FIVE EMPLOYEES UP TO FIFTY ARE USUALLY THE ONES THAT HAVE LESS STAFF -- AND LESS PEOPLE ABLE TO CREATE A PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT -- AND SO. THE EMPLOYEES OF THOSE BUSINESSES ARE USUALLY THE ONES THAT ARE MORE VULNERABLE. BECAUSE THERE'S LESS STAFF THERE'S LESS PEOPLE TO CREATE A PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND EIGHT EDUCATING GUIDE SO BY DOING -- A MANDATE THAT THAT APPLIES TO MORE EMPLOYERS I THINK THAT YOUR SURVEYING AND SUPPORTING I FELT VERY LARGE DEMOGRAPHIC HERE IN CALIFORNIA. COUPLE OTHER POINTS CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. A ON AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE SO CURRENTLY THE THE LAW MANDATES HARASSMENT TRAINING OF EMPLOYERS WITH FIFTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES -- THE SUPERVISORS OR MANAGERS TWO HOURS OF INTERACTIVE CONTENT% EVERY OTHER YEAR. I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT DOESN'T WORK ABOUT THAT -- SO UNFORTUNATELY OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO. THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY HAS LARGELY TAKEN A DEFENSIVE POSTURE WITHOUT AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THEIR INTENT. IN ALL THE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THAT NEED HAS LARGELY BEEN DRIVEN BY A NEED. TO REDUCE OR MINIMIZE CLAIMS. AND YOUR INTENT USUALLY DICTATES THE OUTCOME YOU GET. AND SO BECAUSE THE ATTACK HAS BEEN EMPLOYER DRIVEN TO REDUCE OR DEFEND AGAINST CLAIMS YOU'RE NOT GETTING. AN UP LEVELING OF SKILLS AND EDUCATION. WHAT IS CHANGE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT I THINK WHAT'S CHANGED IS DEMOGRAPHICS AND SOCIAL MEDIA? SO I SAY DEMOGRAPHICS. WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN WELL REPRESENTED IN THE POWER STRUCTURE OF ORGANIZATIONS. FEELING MORE AND MORE COMFORTABLE TO SPEAK UP. AND LESS TOLERANT OF BAD BEHAVIOR. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA SO THAT ANYONE AN ORGANIZATION WHO IS COMFORTABLE SPEAKING UP CAN NOW EASILY SHINE A LIGHT ON BAD BEHAVIOR. SELL LESS TOLERANCE FOR BAD BEHAVIOR AND MORE VISIBLE VISIBILITY INTO BAD BEHAVIOR. LASTLY WHAT WORKS -- IN THE TEN PLUS YEARS THAT -- I'VE BEEN IT AND TRAIN WORKING WITH WORK FORCES IN CALIFORNIA SO WE WORK WITH ABOUT A THOUSAND WORK FORCES IN CALIFORNIA -- MIDSIZE WORK FORCES ALL THE WAY UP TO FORTUNE FIFTY WORK FORCES. AND REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE AND INDUSTRY VERTICAL THERE ARE THERE ARE A FEW COMMON DENOMINATORS IN TERMS OF THINGS THAT DO WORK. SO WHAT TYPICALLY WORKS IS GENERALLY GOOD QUALITY CONTENT -- TYPICALLY. ILLUSTRATED BY ARE FOCUSED ON GOOD VIDEO SCENES -- SO STORIES IN VIDEO SCENES REFLECTING CURRENT EVENTS THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE NEWS THINGS ARE HAPPENING -- AN EVERYDAY KIND OF COMMUNITY THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THE IDEA IS. YOU NEED TO GET FOLKS IN THE WORKPLACE TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES. THERE THERE ARE OFTEN NOT EASY BLACK AND WHITE ISSUES ARE OFF OFTEN SHADES OF GRAY. AND SO YOU NEED TO EDUCATE FOLKS AND UPPER LEVEL THEIR SKILLS TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES. AND IN ADDITION YOU NEED TO PROVIDE. LEARN OUR INTERACTIONS SUCH THAT PEOPLE CAN LEARN FROM EACH OTHER AND LEARN FROM THE COMMUNITY RATHER THAN PASSIVELY JUST HERE A ONE SIDED EMPLOYER MESSAGE THAT. OFTEN DOES IT RESULT -- IT IN. IT L. N. UP LEVELING SO -- ALL AND ALL I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY THE IDEAL OF GETTING PEOPLE UP LEVELED -- TO A POINT WHERE THEY'RE EDUCATED IN AND AND AND ABLE TO CREATE HEALTHY WORKPLACE CULTURES WHICH I KNOW IN CALIFORNIA. IS IDEALLY WHAT WE WANNA MODEL. THANK YOU IT TOOK A MOMENT TO ESTABLISH THE RUN A NATION. THAT'S A VERY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THURMAN AYE ARE HERE. I'M READY TO GO. THURMOND HERE LAURA -- BONTA.

FOURTEEN TWELVE I'M WELCOME BACK TO LABOR SENATOR BRADFORD WE'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED WORKING WITH YOU IN YOUR CHAIR AND WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK HERE IN THE HOUSE A LABOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT. SB -- FOURTEEN TWELVE IT'S SIMPLY CLARIFIES THAT EMPLOYERS SHOULD USE BACKGROUND CHECKS TO SCREEN PEOPLE. ONLY FOR RELEVANT -- EXPUNGEMENT. SPONSORED SHOULD SAY CONVICTIONS. SOME EMPLOYERS AS WE KNOW GO FAR BEYOND WHAT THE BACKGROUND CHECKS SHOULD -- BE AND I USE THOSE EXPUNGED -- CONVICTIONS ARE RELEVANT FOR EXCLUSION ARE DENYING -- EMPLOYMENT -- THIS COMPLETELY UNDERMINES TO REHABILITATE OF GOALS THAT WE'VE SAT IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM -- WHEN THIS BILL LEFT THE SENATE? WE HAD FIVE ORGANIZATIONS WHO OPPOSE IT. DO DO WE SHOULD HEAR WOULD ONLY ONE A WE HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY. AND EVERY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SEVERAL ONE HAS IN AGREEMENT THAT. THIS IS A GOOD COMMONSENSE BILL THAT THEY CAN LIVE AND WORK WITH -- ALSO WILL TAKE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT WERE REMOVED. EVEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AS WELL WE HAVE THAT COMMITMENT. THIS BILL DOES NOT -- A PANDERS TO PROCEED OUT FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT OR STATE EMPLOYMENT ROSE AGAIN. STRAIGHT. FOR ITS KNOW -- VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW THEY STEAL THOSE CRIMES THAT ARE STILL EXCLUDED BY FEDERAL LAW. OF THIS BILL DOES NOT SUPERSEDE THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS STILL CAN -- DO BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THIS IS SUPER. EMPLOYERS ARE GOING BEYOND WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT LAWS WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT EXPUNGEMENT IN A BACKGROUND CHECKS AND ON THAT NOTE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. YOUR ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON M. EMILY CHILD ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU AND THE OTHERS WISHING TO SPEAK AND TO SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY OPPOSITION ON THE MEASURE PLEASE COME. FOR GOOD AFTERNOON CHRISTINA'S BAGNOLI WITH THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION. I'M. SAYING I WELL YOU GUYS KNOW THAT WE HAVE NO AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION -- I THINK THAT THIS IS A WELL INTENDED BILL -- IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT'S A TIMELY ISSUE -- AT BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL BY I'M I THINK FEDERAL LEVEL IS THE KEY WORD HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS WE NEED ADJUSTED IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH. THIS BILL IF IT'S IMPLEMENTED. I'M. WERE THE BILL ITSELF REMOVES OUR ABILITY TO PULL A FULL CONVICTION HISTORY. AND ALSO AFFIRMATIVELY REMOVES OUR ABILITY TO CONSIDER PRETRIAL DIVERSION PROGRAM WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT OF THE FDIC. I'M. EXCUSE ME I'M ALWAYS OUT OF BREATH -- ARE. OUR REQUIREMENTS I IT REQUIRES US TO NOT HIRE FOR CERTAIN CRIMINAL OFFENSES INVOLVING. DISHONESTY BREACH OF TRUST YOUR MONEY LAUNDERING MORE DISAGREEING AGREED TO ENTER ENTER PRE TRIAL DIVERSION. OR SIMILAR PROGRAM IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROSECUTION FOR SUCH OFFENSE. AND SO -- BASICALLY -- WE FEEL THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH OUR FEDERAL REGULATOR -- THE FDIC HAS STATED IN BOTH THEIR CURRENT AN* UPDATED SO P. THEIR STATEMENT OF POLICY. I'M AN EXAMPLE OF OUR DUTY IS TIED TO OBTAIN A LISTING OF ALL CONVICTIONS AND PROGRAM AND TREES. I'M I'M GRAVE CONCERN OF OURS IS RECENT LITIGATION THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS AREA. A WITH FRANK NO NORI VERSES VIVI VIVENT I'M BASICALLY IN THE ARGUMENTS IT WAS. ASSERTED THAT LABOR CODE WITCHES I WHAT THIS BILL IS WRITTEN UNDER WAS VIOLATED. I THE PLAINTIFFS PLAINTIFFS CLAIM ALLEGED THAT THE DEFENDANT VIOLATED CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE BY ASKING FOR S. OR SEEKING FROM ANY SOURCE INFORMATION ABOUT PRIOR. CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. WE'RE FEARFUL THAT BECAUSE THERE'S CURRENTLY TO GAZE XIN THAT'S BEING DECIDED NOW I THAT IF THIS BILL SIGNED INTO LAW WE'RE GOING TO STEP BACK INTO THE EXACT SAME THING. AYE BECAUSE THE BILL AMENDS -- PARAGRAPH AM. I WHICH I IS A SECTION THAT I ESSENTIALLY I GIVES A CARVE OUT THE FULL CONVICTION HISTORY. I THAT IS WHY WE PROPOSE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE PROPOSED WE'RE THE ONLY EMPLOYERS OPERATING UNDER THE LAWS OF THE FDIC THAT ARE OPPOSING THIS BILL -- AND HAVING REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION WERE REGULATED BY THEM AND WERE PENALIZED A MILLION DOLLARS A DAY FOR VIOLATING -- SECTION NINETEEN AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A GOTCHA SITUATION WHERE WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW. BUT THEN WE'RE VIOLATING STATE LAW. AND SO -- THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IT'S OUR MOST IMPORTANT CONCERN AND WE REALLY NEED THAT SMALL ISSUE FIXED WE BELIEVE. THAT SENATOR BRADFORD CAN STILL HAVE A BILL THAT AFFECTS ALL OTHER EMPLOYERS. ON THAT DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE CERTAIN REQUIREMENT FROM THE FDIC. THANK YOU DIGITAL. TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. RECENTLY WITH CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION ORIGINALLY HERE JUST THAT OFFER TECHNICAL ADVICE BUT THE BILL ESSENTIALLY FORCES A TECHNICAL TECHNICAL VIOLATION OF LAW BECAUSE IT IT BASICALLY SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYER. YOU CANNOT PULL FULL CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK BUT FOR PARTICULAR CRIMES. WELL CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS WORK VERY MUCH LIKE COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS WHEN YOU WANT TO INQUIRE ABOUT INDIVIDUALS -- EDUCATION BACKGROUND YOU DON'T GET TO ASK THE COLLEGE JUST GIVE ME THE GRADES FOR CHEMISTRY YOU GET A FULL REPORT OF THE ENTIRE TRANSCRIPT. OF THAT TIME IN COLLEGE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS WORK THE SAME WAY WHEN WE ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ROOM FOR REPORT WE GET ALL CRIMES. BY VIRTUE THE FACT WE'RE GONNA GET ALL CRIMES WERE GONNA BE VIOLATING THIS BILL BUT THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO CHECK WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF THE CRIMES OF THE FDIC SAYS. THERE WE CAN'T HIRE FOR SO SO ULTIMATELY IT WAS AN EMINENTLY REASONABLE AMENDMENT THAT WE ASK FOR WE ASK SENATOR BRADFORD. LET'S PUT AN AMENDMENT THE BILL THAT SAYS YOU HAVE A SAFE HARBOR IF YOU RECEIVE A FULL BACKGROUND CHECK BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET -- ONE BUT YOU CAN ONLY CONDITION EMPLOYMENT. BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE FEDERAL REGULATOR SAYS THAT YOU CAN'T HIRE. FOR IT WAS A IT'S A REASONABLE AMENDMENT BUT WAS REJECTED. SO IT FORCES A TECHNICAL VIOLATION YOU'RE IN RECEIPT OF A FULL REPORT YOU VIOLATED THE BILL. BUT THAT'S ONLY WITH THE DOJ ISSUES FOR THE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS [inaudible] SO [inaudible] PURPOSE THINK. THEY DO OTHERS WISHING TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE. PARKER DOESN'T HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE IN OPPOSE LOS MINUTE POSITION BY IT FOR THE SAME REASON STATED BY THE PACKERS THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU. TRACY SELF ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WERE LISTEN OPPOSITION IN THE ANALYSIS BUT DO YOU WANNA AND STRESS THE FACT THAT WE WILL BE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION AND BOEING NEUTRAL. ONCE AND THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS AT THE AUTHOR AND PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ARE AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN A STAFF ON THIS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MAKE YOU. ORGAN MARKETS DEL I WITH CALIFORNIA STATUS. CALIFORNIA SPECIAL THIS ASSOCIATION SIMILARLY WE WILL BE REMOVING OPPOSITION I LIKE TELL AYE MY COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER SWITCHING TO ADD ON OPPOSITION SEEING NONE BOX [inaudible] AND DUBBED. CAROL MCINTYRE WITH THE CABLE COMPANY CAME TO ME AND SAID. DATA AT SOME FCC REQUIRE WE WERE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT BECAUSE SHE SHE STUCK WITH THE THE INTENT OF THE BILL THE REASON THE BILL GOT AS FAR AS IT DID. AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY OPPOSITION BECAUSE SHE WORKED WITH MAKING SURE THAT WE PROVIDED. PEOPLE WHO HAD CRIMINAL RECORDS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW. BEFORE -- SOMEBODY BROWN FILED IT THROUGH THEIR THEIR APPLICATION TO TRANSFER HIS ONCE THEY SEE. THAT YOU'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME ON BETA EVEN GIVE YOU. A FIRST CHANCE LAST US A SECOND CHANCE AND AND SO OF OF WE WORK TO SIMPLY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY FEAR. YOU DOING CABLE AND YOU'RE YOU'RE. THEIR SEX OFFENDER RAPIST WE DON'T WANT YOU GOING IN AND PUTTING CABLE. AND PEOPLE HOMES AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH A LOT OF THAT KNOWING THAT THE ULTIMATE. PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO -- WAS NOT TO BE IN VIOLATION OF ANY FEDERAL RACE BUT MOST IMPORTANT HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE INTO THE JOB MARKET. AND SO CAN YOU GET AND LISTEN TO THE PARK CAN KIND OF WALK US THROUGH HOW YOU SEE. THIS WOULD WORK THROUGH -- SOMEBODY THE CITY OF ALL COLLEGE CHALLENGE OF HOW DO YOU SEE IT WORKING THERE THEY'VE BEEN ABLE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS OR HOW THIS BILL. THE HOME WORKS WITH OUR DOESN'T CODE GONE. IN OPPOSITION. I THINK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I THINK YOU TOUCHED UPON IT ON THIS BILL IN NO WAY SUPERSEDES. FEDERAL REGULATIONS WHAT THE BANKS HAVE TO DO IN REGARDS TO FELT WERE REGULATIONS OF BACKGROUND CHECKS IN THOSE -- CONVICTIONS THAT EXCLUDE EMPLOYMENT IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. ALL WE'RE SEEING JUST LIKE AS YOU STATED. LET INDIVIDUAL HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW LET THEM MAY HAVE BEEN MADE A AS THE LARGEST CURRENT LEGISLATION STATES. HAVE A CONDITIONAL OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT AND THEN DO THE BACKGROUND -- BACKGROUND CHECKS IN THOSE. OFFENSES THAT FALL WITH THUNDER FEDERAL REGULATION THAT EXCLUDES FROM EMPLOYMENT BE AN EMBEZZLEMENT PATH GRAND LARCENY. THAT WOULD EXCLUDE THAT INDIVIDUAL BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WITH -- ES DE YOU ARE AYE OR A I DON'T KNOW -- PETTY THEFT OR WHATEVER OUR SOULS ARE NOT. A QUALIFICATIONS THAT SHOULD EXCLUDE YOU'VE I MEAN CONVICTIONS I SHOULD EXCLUDE YOU FROM EMPLOYMENT SO AGAIN I I I I THINK. IT SHOULDN'T BE MISSED ON ANY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE OF THE MOUNT OF OPPOSITION THAT WE HAD IN THE SENATE AND IT'S ONLY. ONE MAN STANDING RIGHT NOW WHO CONTINUES TO USE THE SAME ARGUMENT AND NOT AMENDMENT THAT THEY ARE ASKING FOR ALL BUT GETS THE BILL. IT IT TAKES AWAY ANY TEETH IN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE AND JUST AS YOU REACH COMMON GROUND WITH OF THE CABLE INSTITUTION WE'VE REACHED A COMMON GROUND WITH ALL OTHER. LENDING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CREDIT UNIONS OF AND THE LIKE AND AS YOU HEARD EVEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- WILL BE REMOVING THEIR OPPOSITION BECAUSE A REASONABLE BILL THE GIVES OUR THOSE WITH PRIOR CONVICTIONS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR REHABILITATION IN CHANGING THEIR LIVES IN AND FINING FULL EMPLOYMENT. BUT AGAIN WHAT OUT INVITE WITHOUT VIOLATION OF THOSE% FEDERAL LAWS IN THOSE REQUIREMENTS THAT EXIST I THOUGHT THAT'S THE STATE DOES NOT PREEMPT THOSE FEDERAL REGULATIONS. THE BILL WOULD NOT DO THAT. THOUGH IS IT. AND MAY BACK AFTER OPPOSITION BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE. BUT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND PULL THE IN HIGHER [inaudible] RECORDS. AFTER YOU'VE INTERVIEWED IN YOUR SAME FEDERAL RIGHTS SO YOU CAN'T EVEN INTERVIEW ANYBODY. SO ANYBODY CREEK AND SO IF. IF A HUNDRED PEOPLE APPLY FOR A JOB YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO PULL ALL THE CRIMINAL RECORDS FOR ALL ONE HUNDRED OF THEM BEFORE YOU IDIOT INTERVIEW THEM. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE I JUST NOTICED THAT SON JUST TRYING TO YOU KNOW NOT TRYING TO GET YOU IN A BIND OF TRYING TO GET PROCEDURALLY NOW OBSOLETE NOW WE DON'T DE IN MOST CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND UP UNTIL. RIGHT BEFORE YOU PROVIDE AN OFFER TO THE EMPLOYEE SO IT'S DATED IT'S NOT WE DON'T PULL IT BEFORE WE INTERVIEW THE INDIVIDUAL. I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A COUPLE A DIFFERENCE THINGS I AGREE WITH SENATOR BRADFORD THE BILL DOESN'T. PER HIT DOESN'T CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL LAW AND HOW WE GO ABOUT HIRING WHAT THE BILL SAYS IS YOU CAN'T PULL FOR THEM CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK. SO IF YOU. IF YOU HAVE AN FDIC REQUIREMENT THIS IS YOU CAN'T HIRE SOMEBODY OF THEFT AND EMBEZZLEMENT. HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT DISCERNING WHETHER OR NOT THAT INDIVIDUALS BEEN CONVICTED OF THEFT OR EMBEZZLEMENT? PEOPLE A BACKGROUND CHECK. HIS BILL SAYS YOU CAN'T PULL FOR BACKGROUND CHECK SO HOW WOULD THE INSTITUTION KNOW THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME. YOU DON'T GET YOU JUST SAY TO THE DOJ HEY CAN I GET A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK ONLY ON THEFT EMBEZZLEMENT. IS ORGAN THOUGH YOU GET THE ENTIRE REPORT. AND BY VIRTUE OF THAT IF FORCES A TO THERE'S A TECHNICAL VIOLATION THE BILL BECAUSE THE BILL SAYS YOU CANNOT SEEK ANYTHING BUT A BACKGROUND CHECK FOR ONLY. PARTICULAR CRIMES. THAT'S NOT HOW BACKGROUND CHECKS WORK. SO WHY NOT JUST HAVE AN AMENDMENT THAT ESSENTIALLY SAYS YOUR HELD HARMLESS IS AN INSTITUTION IF YOU PULL FOR BACKGROUND CHECK BUT YOU CAN'T HIRE ANYBODY. IF THEFT EMBEZZLEMENT IS NOT ON THE BACKGROUND CHECK. THE REASONABLE MAN I CAN RESPOND THAT BECAUSE I I DID EXPUNGEMENT BILL WHEN I WAS IN THOSE SIMPLY AND AND IT WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR BUT AS WE ALL KNOW THOSE WHO HAVE DONE EXPUNGEMENT ARE [inaudible] OF BILLS. EVEN THE BAND THE BOX BILLS BUT EXPUNGE OF BILLS MORE SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS AHA. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN WE KNOW NOTHING IS EVER HAD. YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL SO IT DOESN'T PUT A FIRE WALL UP THERE WE UNDERSTAND. WHAT THOSE FEDERAL REGULATIONS STATE WERE SEEN DON'T USE THOSE BIASES? AND I AND DISCRIMINATING AND FROM HIRING BASED ON THOSE CONVICTIONS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THOSE FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES I THINK WE'RE TRYING. TO MIX APPLES WITH ORANGES AND AND CONVOLUTED THIS BECAUSE I I I THINK IT'S STRAIGHT FOR I THINK WE'VE LACY GOT AGREEMENT WITH EVERYBODY. BUT THE BANKS IN LIFE SO WE'RE NOT HERE TO PREEMPT IN I ASKED YOU -- TO IGNORE FEDERAL LAW THIS IS NOT TO AUTHORITIES LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE TO DO SUCH SHOW ON I I THINK IT'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT WITH THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN WILLING TO BE OPEN. I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THAT BANKS OUT BUT I I'M I'M SOMEWHAT SURPRISED THAT. THE FACT THAT. THERE CHALLENGES HERE I WITH THE SAFEGUARDS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HAD HOW DO YOU ADDRESSED. ALL THE FRAUDULENT BEHAVIORS. OF THE BANKS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF AYE DO YOU ADDRESS THAT A YOU HAD THE SAFEGUARDS HERE BUT YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO HAVE SET UP BATTLE BREAK ACCOUNTS. ALL OF IN THAT INDIVIDUAL'S NAME SOUL PEOPLE'S DATA SO IT CLEARLY SHOWS WHATEVER BACKGROUND CHECKS YOU WERE USING. DIDN'T DO WELL IN EMPLOYEES THAT YOU CURRENTLY ARE WORKING IN THE BANKING INSTITUTION -- VICE SHARE FLOOR. YOU HAD A QUESTION. I BUT I THINK YOU DID BEFORE I GOT. GOOD IN THE OF THAT -- OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE COMING. SOME IN MEMORY BUS [inaudible] SO -- IS THERE ARE AWAY THEN -- THAT YOU KNOW OF FOR THESE INSTITUTIONS TO ONLY GET. THE BACKGROUND. DATA THAT THEY NEED. THAT THAT IS RELEVANT TO THESE POSITIONS TO THIS INDUSTRY. I MEAN BY DOING BACKGROUND CHECKS YOU WILL BUILD UP. FIND THAT WHICH IS RELEVANT -- TO DISQUALIFYING YOU FROM I AM BEING I'M BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE BANKING INSTITUTION AND WILL GET THE FULL BACKGROUND [inaudible] I KNOW. WHAT WERE WORSE WERE SEEN WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR FULL BACKGROUND CHECK BUT REALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS DON'T USE THOSE THAT INFORMATION THAT IS NOT RELEVANT? TO THOSE FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND AND DISCRIMINATING AGAINST EMPLOYEES AND WE'VE SEEN IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO. DON'T DISQUALIFY SOMEBODY WHO. LIKE I SAY HEADED DO YOU LIVE FROM BEING EMPLOYED THEY WILL GET THEY WILL YET BE IT YES THAT THEY'RE WITH YOU I DID THAT. DON'T USE THAT AGAINST THEM DON'T YET DON'T USE THAT AS THE REASON YOU ARE NOT HIGHER. EXACTLY THANK YOU. YEAH I REQUEST FOR US IN THAT SAME QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION AS WELL. I I GUESS I GOT THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTOOD RIGHT NOW FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY WERE. THERE IS NO WAY. THAT THEY WOULD GET THE FULL BACKGROUND CHECKS [inaudible] BUT THAT'S CORRECT UNDER THIS BILL ON UNDER THE LITIGATED CASE I WHAT THEY WANT IS TO STOP US FROM PULLING THE FULL BACKGROUND CHECK WE COULD ONLY PULL PARTICULAR CONVICTION. WE REMOVE THE WORD PARTICULAR OUT THAT WE AMENDED THAT IT'S STILL IN THE BILL BY -- WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT BEING REMOVED UNDER SECTION M. OF THE BILL. I SAID THEY SAYS WE CAN SEEK I'VE FROM ANY SOURCE INFORMATION REGARDING A CRIMINAL CONVICTION AND SAID OF A PARTICULAR CRIMINAL CONVICTION. WE CANNOT AMEND THE BILL IN THIS SETTING BUT THE AUTHOR HAS SAID THAT -- THE BILL IS BEING AMENDED AND DOES NOT. PROHIBIT THE ABILITY TO GET THE BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT ARE NEEDED AS I STAND IT THE OUT THERE IS SAYING THAT. DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT APPEAR IN THAT BACKGROUND CHECK THAT MIGHT NOT BE RELATED TO THE POSITION TO BE USED IN A WAY pCANDIDATE EXACTLY I THINK THE AUTHOR IS EMPHASIZING THAT. AND IT HAS JUST SAID THAT ANY LANGUAGE THAT -- MADE ANY OTHER REFERENCES SHALL BE REMOVED -- OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. UPSET I MOVE THE BILL COLLECTING THEY'RE CLOSE WE JUST NEED TO BEAT. MAYBE IT'S A BARRIER BETWEEN THEM FOR FREE FEW DAYS AND THEN COME BACK AGAIN BRIGHT FIVE I FEEL COMFORTABLE. THAT ONCE THEY'RE COMMUNICATING ON THE SAME [inaudible] PAGE. DON'T GET THERE BECAUSE LIKE I HEAR THEM SAYING THE SAME THING JUST USING THEIR OWN VERNACULAR. POLICY SO I'VE I'M MAKE A MOTION. TWO TO DEVELOP THOSE MOVES THEIR SECOND. THURMOND SECOND SO I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. I IT IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND I DO RESPECT -- THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BOTH IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND IN OPPOSITION OF THIS MEASURE BUT I I THINK. THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN I WILL STRESS SAID AGAIN THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE FROM THE TIME THIS BILLORIGINATED OUT OF THE SENATE TO WORD IS NOW. WE MOVE MOUNTAINS AND TO THERE JUST ONE INDIVIDUAL STE STAND IN OUR ORGANIZATION I SHOULD SAY THAT STANDING. AND THE AYE BUT AGAIN IT'S IT'S SHOULDN'T BE LOST UPON. THIS COMMITTEE THAT THE STANDARDS ON WHICH THEY THINK SHOULD APPLY TO THIS BILL. AND IF IT'S EXISTING LAWS. IT IS FILLED MEASURE MISERABLY AND THEM SCREENING EMPLOYEES WHO AGAIN WITH SET UP FRAUDULENT BANK ACCOUNTS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS AND PRY PEOPLE. CROSSES NATION SO EIGHT IT CLEARLY SHOWS WE NEED TO FIX THIS PROCESS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU THE BILL HAS A MOTION A SECOND IT HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMAN AYE THURMOND AYE FLORA. BONTA. JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE REBUS. REVERSE AYE STEINORTH. STEINORTH KNOW THAT THINGS IT GOES OUT LANCASHIRE THINK YOU MEMBERS. I SEE WE HAVE SENATOR STERN WHO WAS HERE WE WELCOME SENATOR STERN TO PRESENT AS HE FOURTEEN SEVENTY WELCOME CENTER. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. MEMBERS OF THE BRIEFING OVER AT THE TAIL END YOU'RE HEARING THAT APPRECIATED MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- THIS BILL IS ABOUT. GETTING CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT TO BE A LITTLE BIT SMARTER ABOUT WHAT'S COMING DOWN THE PIKE OFTEN WE JUST LOOK. A YEAR OR TWO AHEAD BUT TO ACTUALLY ANTICIPATED CHANGES WERE TO SEE IN THE WORK FORCE GOING FOR AS WE THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE -- A LOT FASTER IN TERMS OF OUR ANALYSIS OF WHAT JOBS ARE GONNA LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURETHE PACE OF TECHNOLOGY GROWTH. THE BENEFITS OF THAT TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO IMPACTS IT MAY HAVE ON THE MIDDLE CLASS KNOWN INCOME INEQUALITIES SO -- WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TENSION AROUND AUTOMATION AND IT'S BEEN A CONSTANT SOURCE OF CONVERSATION BUT THE GOAL I THINK FOR ALL OF US IS CALIFORNIA'S SHOULD BE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE. WE ACTUALLY WE CAN EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND STILL HAVE A DURABLE MIDDLE CLASS. AND IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO MARRY THOSE TWO THINGS. THAT TO ME IS A TRANSCENDENT KIND OF PUBLIC POLICIES THAT TO THIS BILL IS SORTED SUPPOSED TO FORM THE THINK TANK THAT EVENTUALLY. WILL HELP GET THE NEXT GOVERNOR THOSE KINDS OF IDEAS ANNOUNCES LEGISLATURE THOSE KIND OF IDEAS. DOESN'T REALLY PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE EITHER WAY BUT WE DON'T DO LABOR DEMAND ANALYSIS IN A SERIOUS WAY IN THIS STATE WE DO AN ECONOMIC REPORT THAT NONE OF US REALLY READ EVERY YEAR BUT WE ACTUALLY WANT TO PUT SOME OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. TO WORK FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT IN SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ASSEMBLY OF THIS COMMISSION AND THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE BILL SO. SPEC WE ASK. FOR THANK YOU YOU HAVE SOME WITNESSES FOR US YEAH. MR SHARE MEMBER SARAH FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU ALL TODAY -- SO. WE'VE BASICALLY HAVE. A THE UNDERSTANDING THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING ENORMOUS GOOD TO MAKE WORK SAFER TO MAKE IT MORE PRODUCTIVE TO HAVE BENEFITS FOR SOCIETY. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF IT IS LEFT UNCHECKED IT ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO EXACERBATE THE ALL THE INJUSTICES WE SEE. INCOME INEQUALITY WAGE STAGNATION AND POLITICAL POLARIZATION THAT IS DIVIDING OUR COUNTRY. AND SO WE DO THINK IT IS TIME FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO LOOK AT WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF WORK GONNA BE WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ARTIFICIAL TELLIGENT. AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH OUR MEMBERS AFFECTED OUR LAST CONVENTION WE HAD SIX HUNDRED UNION MEMBERS IN THE RAIL. AND WE BROUGHT UP THE QUESTION OF HOW IS HOW IS TECHNOLOGY IMPACTING YOU. AND WE HEARD THAT EVERY WORKER EVERY OCCUPATION. EVERY INDUSTRY IS ALREADY SEEING TECHNOLOGY. CHANGING THEIR INDUSTRIES HAVING AN IMPACT EVERYONE FROM HOTEL WORKERS THAT ARE SEEING HOTELS THAT ARE BEING DESIGNED TO BE COMPLETELY AUTOMATED WE CHECK IN ON A KIOSK AND YOU HAVE A LITTLE ROBOT THAT BRINGS ROOM SERVICE TO YOUR ROOM. SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR FRONT DESK WORKERS REPRESENTED BY THE TEAMSTERS OR HOUSEKEEPERS UPPER NEEDED REPRESENTED BY UNITE HERE. TO ACTORS THAT ARE SEEN DIGITAL IMAGES OF THEMSELVES WORKERS AT EIGHTEEN ANTI. TO BUY HOSPITAL WORKERS DOCTORS AND IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. TWO THE FACT THAT WE'RE USING ALGORITHMS FOR EVERYTHING. LOOKING OUT AT FOR EVERYTHING FROM MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY. TO SAYING WHAT IS THIS PERSON SOMEONE THAT WE SHOULD SEE HOW WE SHOULD WE SET THEIR BAIL. AND SO ALL TECHNOLOGY IS. THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT ROBOTS WILL BE TAKING OUR JOBS BUT MOST LIKELY WE'RE GONNA SEE TECHNOLOGY CHANGING THE WORKPLACE IN VERY GRADUAL WAYS AND WILL BE SEEING PARTS OF OUR JOB THAT WILL BECOME AUTOMATED. AND WE'LL BE SEEING CERTAIN TAX THAT WILL BE AUTOMATED AND THESE CHANGES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN SLOWLY BUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT. ON THE FUTURE OF WORK ON OUR ECONOMY ON THE WEEK WE COLLECT TAXES ON THE STATE AS A WHOLE. M. AND SO WE REALLY SEE THIS COMMISSION. AS A WAY TO GET AHEAD OF THAT. TO SAY THAT THE STATE HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE AND WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WE SEE THIS COMING WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A CHANGE AND WE ACTUALLY WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. IN FACT PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE HEARD BAY. RIGHT HERE GOVERNOR BROWN HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAS CALLED THE STATEWIDE CONFERENCE A BUSINESS AND LABOR LEADERS TO DISCUSS THE IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS AND ECONOMY. HE ANNOUNCED OF THE CONFERENCE IS GONNA BE HAD LA ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH AND TWENTY EIGHT AND FOUR HUNDRED REPRESENTATIVES OF LABOR INDUSTRY AND STATE GOVERNMENT WILL BE INVITED AT THE BILTMORE HOTEL. THE QUOTE IS WE WILL EXPLORE EVERY FACTOR INVOLVED IN AUTOMATION TO HELP US DEVELOP THE MEANS TO COUNTERACT ANY ADVERSE EFFECT OF THIS DEVELOPMENT. OF OUR TIME. AND THAT MAY HAVE ON OUR PEOPLE AND OUR ECONOMY. THE IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON OUR WORKERS THEIR JOB SECURITY THEIR INCOME THEIR SKILLS THEIR EDUCATION IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO ALL OF US. AND YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD GOTTEN THE INVITATION. TO THIS HEARING IS IS ACTUALLY FROM THE LABOR FEDERATION. NEWSLETTER FROM. NINETEEN SIXTY ONE THE FIRST GOVERNOR BROWN WHO CALLED TOGETHER. A CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS AND IT. AND BACK THEN HEME GOVERNOR BROWN KNEW THAT WHEN YOU BRING LABOR AND MANAGEMENT TOGETHER WE CAN DO SOME REALLY GREAT THINGS AND SO WE HAVE THE HOPE THAT THIS COMMISSION WILL DO REALLY GREAT THINGS FOR PLANNING FUTURE WORK IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH. YOU GOT ME I JEFF AND WAS INVITED IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE BUT THANK YOU HOW WELL DONE -- ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY AFFECT TO FOLLOW. A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME'S DOUG BLOCK PROUD TO REALLY BE REPRESENTING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TEAMSTERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA. AND CO SPONSORS ON THIS BILL. HOW THESE ISSUES ABOUT AUTOMATION AND TECHNOLOGY? TOUCH EVERY INDUSTRY THAT WE WORK AND AND THEY'RE SO IMPORTANT TO OUR UNION THAT I'M ACTUALLY SPENDING ABOUT HALF MY TIME ON IT. IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS OR SO I'VE SPOKEN THAT FOR LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS FIVE CONFERENCES I'VE TRAVELED FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SILICON VALLEY TO DC. HERE I AM EVERYWHERE I GO I HEAR TALK ABOUT THE COMING ROBOT APOCALYPSE FOR TRANSPORTATION WORKERS -- FOR MILLION WORKERS IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TWENTY YEARS. AND I HEAR DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THE PROBLEMS AND THE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS. AB ONE THING I DO AGREE ON IS I'M I'M ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT FOR EVERY JOB THAT WE DO. THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING TO THINK OF AN HAP OR A ROBOT TO REPLACE US WITH. BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY EXCEPT THE ROBOT APOCALYPSE IS A GIVEN. AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. STARTING IN THIS BUILDING. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK% THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WORKERS AND TECHNOLOGY AND SPECIFICALLY WHO BENEFITS -- JUST SAYS CORPORATIONS WOULDN'T TRUST LABOR TO WRITE THE RULES WE DON'T TRUST THEM. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS COMMISSION AS A PLACE WHERE ALL THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE CAN HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO GET A HANDLE ON THE PROBLEM. LOOK AT THE PET POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AND ADVISE YOU THE POLICYMAKERS AND THE REGULATORS ON HOW WE SHOULD BE MOVING FORWARD TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL OF US. NOW I WILL SAY THAT. THE TEMPTATION FOR US AND MANY PEOPLE IN LABOR. WOULD BE TO COME TO THIS LABOR COMMITTEE AND ASK YOU TO JOIN UP WITH US IN A SELF RIGHTEOUS REVOLUTION AS WE DESTROY THE MACHINES [inaudible] AND NOW -- YOU REMEMBER THE LUDDITES RIGHT. THE TEXTILE WORKERS WHO BROKE THE MACHINES AND AND THAT. FRANKLY SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN TO ME [inaudible] BUT THE TEAMSTERS HAVE ACTUALLY NEVER BEEN LUDDITES AND I WENT BACK INTO OUR UNION'S ARCHIVES. STARTED IN NINETEEN NO THREE DRIVING TEAMS OF HORSES DELIVERING MILK BREAD I A SPEAR EVERYTHING ELSE. TEN YEARS LATER WE SOME MOTORIZED TRUCKS GOING TO PRODUCTION. AND MANY PEOPLE IN OUR IN UNION SCOFFED AT THE IDEA THAT TRUCKS WOULD EVER REPLACE THE HORSE AND CARRIAGE. WE ALL ACTED IN NEW GENERAL PRESIDENT IN NINETEEN ó SEVEN AND HE SAW THAT TECHNOLOGY WAS RADICALLY CHANGING OUR JOBS. AND AS A UNION WE ADAPTED AND WE WENT TO OUR EMPLOYERS AND WE SAID. THIS IS COMING YOU NEED TO TRAIN YOU NEED TO BY TRUCKS AND TEACH US HOW TO DRIVE THEM. WE ARE DOING THAT AS A UNION NOW WE'VE BEEN MEETING. EVERYBODY FROM ROBOT MANUFACTURERS DELIVERY ROBOTS TO THE SCOOTER PEOPLE TO THE TRUCK PLATOONS. WE NEED YOUR HELP. WE NEED YOU TO GET A SEAT AT THE TABLE HERE. THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS THAT. I SERVE AT THE PLEASURE OF THIS GOVERNOR ON THE COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY IN WORKERS COMPENSATION. WE HAVE EQUAL REPRESENTATION FROM LABOR AND BUSINESS. WE BRING AND ACADEMICS TO STUDY THE ISSUES THAT AS THEY RELATE TO HEALTH AND SAFETY AND REFORMS IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. WE ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ON POLICY. WE ENVISION THAT THIS COMMISSION WALLS WILL PROVIDE THE SAME FUNCTION.

DO YOU DRAW COULD FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE HAVE NO POSITION ON THE BILL AT THIS TIME BUT ON REVIEWING THE IN THE RECENT AMENDMENTS WE HAVE. CONCERNS AND THOUGHTS ON THE COMPOSITION WORK. CONSIDERING HOW A CURRENT AND FUTURE AUTOMATION INNOVATION IN THE WORKPLACE WILL AFFECT OF THE WORKFORCE IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR MANUFACTURERS AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT. STAKEHOLDERS ARE AT THE TABLE AND AWARE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES THAT FACE OUR OUR INDUSTRY SO WHERE WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WE CAN -- ARE LOOKING FOR TO WORKING IN THE FUTURE. ANYONE ELSE'S CONSISTS. ANY OPPOSITION TO ADD ON SEEING NONE TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER JONES SAWYER THAT'S NOT AND I THINK YOU FORTY EFFORT ACTUALLY THAT IS LONG OVERDUE THAT WE START LOOKING IN THE FUTURE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS IN THE FORM OF A MAN MADE OR OR IS A WEEKEND MAKE SURE -- WE TAKE CARE ONE THING -- YOU KNOW WHAT ONE WHEN I HEAR THIS JUST DISCUSSION OF STEM THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE FUTURE -- EVEN NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT SILICON VALLEY YOU DON'T SEE ANY AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO. IN ANY MEASURABLE NUMBER -- HOPEFULLY THIS MIDDLE CLASSES AND LIKE WHITE MIDDLE CLASS THAT'S GONNA COME UP THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE CONCERNED WITH AS OF HIS THE WAY WE CAN. INCLUDE THAT. IN YOUR ANALYSIS OF HOW WE GET ON AFTER AMERICAN LATINOS INVOLVED IN THIS OTHERWISE OF BEACHES ALL WHITE NATION AND THAT'S NOT. GOOD FOR THE FOR THE FUTURE YOU KNOW WHEN I WHEN I LOOK AT STAR WARS STAR TREK IS ONLY ONE BLACK GUY WHEN I SEE TERMINATOR THERE'S NO. NO BLACK PEOPLE MANLINESS DEATHLY DIFFERS WESTWORLD IS NO BLACK PEOPLE IN EVEN OUT A NEW ONE TO BLACK PEOPLE ROBUST SO THEIR SERVANTS WHO SAVED THE WHITE PEOPLE. SO AT SOME POINT[inaudible] THE WE'VE GOT A IT'S YOU KNOW WE CAN GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO TECHNOLOGY BUT I DON'T LOOK BACK AND WE'VE LEFT A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE BEHIND. IN ALL THOSE I'VE SEEN ANY LATINO SO WE WON'T EVEN GO THERE AND SO AT SOME POINT WE'VE GOT TO JUST SAY IT. THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY WORLD IS LEAVING SOME PEOPLE BEHIND AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL INCORPORATED AND WE TALK ABOUT HIS NEW MIDDLE CLASS THAT INCORPORATES EVERYBODY KIND OF GETS AWAY. THERE AND WE CAN -- GOT OF IT WE CAN INCLUDE DAD OR HAVE A DISCUSSION OR MAKE IT A PART OF YOUR STUDY THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I SAY YES TO THAT AND I'VE ALREADY GOT IDEAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THE LANGUAGE IS NOT JUST THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DURABLE MIDDLE CLASS BUT IT'S DID LIVE SAW COMMUNITIES OR AND SORT OF LOOKING AT SYSTEMATIC INJUSTICE SERVED LACK OF ACCESS TO THIS ECONOMY SO. NOW WORK WITH THE ON THAT AND IF IT'S HIM IF THE CHAIRS AND THEN WHILE I LIKE THAT IDEA SO -- YEAH THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT. THANK YOU SO REMEMBER KALRA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR -- AND YEAH I REALLY I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH A SUMMER JONES SAWYER HERBS POINT. ANOTHER IT'S ART IMITATING LIFE A LIFE IS IMITATING ART BUT EITHER WAY -- IT'S NOT GOOD BUT IN TERMS WHEN I LIVE RIGHT AND SILICON VALLEY AND THIS SUMMER IS CORRECT -- THERE ARE FAR TOO FEW WOMEN PART AND RIGHT IN THE SHADOWS OF OF YOU KNOW RIGHT RIGHT IN THE SHADOWS. OF SOME THE WEALTHIEST COMPANIES ON EARTH. I MEAN YOU HAVE SOME OF THE POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS A SILICON VALLEY MOST GOING ABOVE. OF LOW INCOME LATINOS ASK AMERICANS IN AN ASIAN AMERICAN. THIS OTHER ASIAN AMERICANS. AND SO I'M ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THE HOUSE BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION -- BUT I WOULD -- LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I IT'S SO IMPORTANT. I'M. AND IN I'M IN A GREAT PRESENTATION WAS ACTUALLY RIGHT ON THE DAY OF THE CONFERENCE UNTIL YOU'VE. GOT ME -- HATED IT BUT OF COURSE WITH IT. BUT THE HOME AND ANY CASE -- LOOK. I AND I THINK IF IF TODAY'S ANY EXAMPLE THAT WE NEED MORE AND MORE TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHAT? HOW OUR ACTIONS OR LACK THERE OF HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND ON OUR WORK FORCE? AND I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF CONFERENCES CONVERSATIONS ABOUT AUTOMATION VERY RARELY IS LABOR AT THE TABLE. OR PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY WORK IN THOSE JOBS ARE GONNA BE ELIMINATED AT THE TABLE. IT'S MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW QUICKLY AUTOMATION FOR HOW MUCH MONEY CAN SAVE HOW YOU CAN REDUCE GOVERNMENT REGULATION. I GET THAT THEIR STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THOSE THINGS AND THAT'S OKAY WITH RUBY RIDGE SAID THOSE THINGS. BUT WE HAVE TO BE INTERESTED IN MORE THINGS ON THAT AND AND AND YOU KNOW AUTOMATION IS SPOKEN OF IN TERMS OF MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR FOLKS. WHAT DOES MAKE LIFE A WHOLE LOT EASIER FEET ON THE JOB? AND SO I I AND A LOT OF COUNTRIES DOING DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE THIS KIND OF EFFICIENCY OF PETITIONS HE BEING CREATED THROUGH AUTOMATION TO TECHNOLOGY. SHOULD MAKE OUR LIVES BETTER SHOULD SERVE AS SOME COUNTRIES AND REDUCED. REDUCE WORK HOURS BUT DON'T REDUCE WAGES SO YAK HAVE MORE FREE TIME HE RIGHT BECAUSE AUTOMATION THAT'S AUTOMATION IS. GIVEN TO EVERYONE. AND NOT JUST OF THE VERY FEW THAT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT SO AS YOU CAN SEE YOU KNOW THAT'S CONVERSATIONS LONG OVERDUE. AYE IT'S BEEN HAPPY IT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN PATCHES. THE WAY THAT YOU INTEND AND THAT I SUPPORT AND SO THANK YOU THANK. FAQ ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- WE PRECIADO YOU BRING THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD -- THIS COMMITTEE ALONG WITH THE SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE DID HOLD THE FUTURE OF WORK. HEARING TO DO JUSTICE -- WAS SET THE DAY GET AHEAD OF THE ISSUE -- AS YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IT GENERATES A LOT OF TENSION AND DISCOMFORT. BECAUSE IT'S TYPICALLY ASSUME THAT -- IMATION MEANS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WILL BE PUT OUT OF WORK AND I APPRECIATE THAT THIS MEASURE SETS OUT TO SAY HOW DO WE IMPROVE OUR LIVES AND USE TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT -- BUT DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE AND BRINGS ALL -- PERSPECTIVES TO THE TABLE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND TO PLAN ABOUT THAT AND SO WE APPRECIATE THE MEASUREAND WHERE IT'S HEADED -- THAT PRE SHEET WHAT ARE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ADDED A ABOUT THE RELATED CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LACK OF DIVERSITY -- IN TECHNOLOGY AND THIS ARE THE COMMITTEE HAS ALSO -- HELD A HEARING. CHALLENGE -- THE TECH SECTOR AND OFFER HELP TO SAY THAT -- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR WORKFORCE IS BROAD AND DIVERSE -- YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WORK I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A FEATURE AND THE ABILITY TO WORK -- YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT I SEE TO ALL OF OUR ECONOMIC MEANS ABOVE FOR MANY OF US WORK ADDS VALUE TO OUR LIVES THE WORK THAT WE DO IS MEANINGFUL. ARE TO US TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO I THINK THAT THEIR HEART CONVERSATIONS AHEAD BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THIS A WORK GROUP WILL BE ABLE TO HELP US BE STRATEGIC. AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE GET AHEAD OF THEM HOW THOSE WHO -- MAY BE. SOME PEOPLE MAY LOSE A CHAT WHY SHOULD THEY BE IN A POSITION -- TO HAVE ANOTHER JOB THAT'S RELATED TO WHAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE OFFERED WHY SHOULDN'T OUR STUDENTS TODAY BE PREPARED AND TRAINED. TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN BE REPLACED BY THE TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGED BY THE TECHNOLOGY SO I APPRECIATE YOU THINKING FORWARD FOR BRINGING THIS.
