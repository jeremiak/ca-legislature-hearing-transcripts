00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:16.054
HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT TWO STORY

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:18.256
HOMES. THAT ARE NOW GOING TO POP

00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:18.990
UP IN SOMEBODY'S BACKYARD AND

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:21.192
WHILE THAT MIGHT BE OKAY I WAS

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:21.793
SOON SOME NEIGHBORS MIGHT YOU

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.195
KNOW- NOT LIKE IT SO MUCH IF

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:25.363
THEY BOUGHT A HOME THAT'S YOU

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.031
KNOW IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAS

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.466
A LOWER YOU KNOW HEIGHTS. AND

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:29.934
NOW WITH YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THESE

00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:31.136
TWO STORIES UP STRUCTURES POP UP

00:29:31.202 --> 00:29:33.071
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:34.372
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:35.140
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW TO

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:36.407
CONSIDER BUILDING CODES- YOU

00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:38.143
KNOW SCALING THAT BACK TO WHAT

00:29:38.209 --> 00:29:40.245
YOU MENTION I THINK IS IMPORTANT

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:40.812
WILL CERTAINLY WORK WITH OUR

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:42.213
FRIENDS OVER THE BUILDING CODE

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.414
OFFICIALS TO SEE. IF THAT MEANS

00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:44.215
THEY'RE THEY'RE THE REQUIREMENTS

00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:46.317
AND FINALLY THE LAST CONCERN

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:46.985
THAT REALLY REMAINS- IS ALLOWING

00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:48.286
A TWO EIGHTY USED TO BE

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:50.355

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:50.822
PROPOSED MULTI FAMILY

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:51.322
DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S NO

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:52.223
REQUIREMENT THAT THAT MULTI

FAMILY DEVELOPMENT EVER BE

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:54.993

00:36:27.985 --> 00:36:29.420
EVEN IN THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:31.322
SOMETIMES IN INAPPROPRIATE WAYS.

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:32.857
BUT THEN CONTINUING TO COME

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:34.792
FORWARD AND OF AN OPPOSING

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:38.262
EFFORTS. TO TRY TO MAKE THE EDU

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:41.465
PROGRAM- AS ROBUST AS POSSIBLE-

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:43.634
AND THE IDEA THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:45.536
A CONCERN THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE AN

00:36:45.603 --> 00:36:47.138
EIGHTY YOU WITHOUT A PRIMARY

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:48.072
HOME I DON'T. I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:50.875
GOING TO HAPPEN BUT IF IT DOES

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:56.080
WHO CARES. IT'S STILL A HOUSING. UNIT THAT SOMEONE CAN LIVE IN-

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:58.215
AND TO COMPARE THIS TO THE- TO

00:36:58.282 --> 00:37:01.052
THE- THE WAREHOUSE FIRE TO GO TO

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:03.020
THE GROCERY BUYER IN OAKLAND.

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:04.922
I'M SORRY BUT THAT IS MORE THAN

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:06.924
A LITTLE BIT DRAMATIC. TALK

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:09.260
ABOUT EDIE YOU HEAR ABOUT ABOUT

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:14.098
A MASSIVE. DANGEROUS WAREHOUSE-

00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:15.266
THAT WAS BUILT MANY MANY MANY

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:17.134
YEARS AGO. SO I YOU KNOW I THINK

00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:19.103
IN THE END WE HEAR A LOT OF THIS

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.238
CONSTANT LIKE NIT PICKING

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:23.507
EXCUSES FOR WHY WE CAN'T DO

00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:26.210
THIS- AND GOD FORBID YOU HAVE A

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:28.379
TWO STORY EIGHTY YOU. GOT FOR

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:30.281
BEDS AND I THANK THE CHAIR THE

00:37:30.348 --> 00:37:31.882
CHAIR FOR HAVING HAD SOME

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:33.117
CONCERN BUT WORKING WITH THE

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:35.620
AUTHOR TO COME TO A GOOD

00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:36.754
COMPROMISE ON THIS BILL AROUND.

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:40.024
THE HEIGHT ISSUE- AND I THINK

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.226
IT'S A GOOD COMBINATION YOU KNOW

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:44.128
IN THE END I WISH SOME OF THE

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:45.596
LOCAL GOVERNMENT GROUPS WOULD BE

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:49.100
MORE FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT WE

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:51.002
HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR CARS

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:53.270
THAT WE HAVE TEN PEOPLE FIFTEEN

00:37:53.337 --> 00:37:55.206
PEOPLE LIVING IN ONE APARTMENT.

00:37:55.272 --> 00:37:57.642
TOGETHER IN MANY PARTS OF

00:37:57.708 --> 00:38:00.044
CALIFORNIA OVERCROWDING BECAUSE

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:03.047
THEY CANNOT AFFORD. TO HAVE TO

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:08.552
HOUSING FOR. YOU KNOW FOR TWO OR

00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:09.954
THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE. I WHICH

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:13.357
WOULD FOCUS ON THAT. BUT THAT'S

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:14.158
A RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:17.194
GOVERNMENTS. TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:38:17.261 --> 00:38:18.362

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:23.100
EXTRA FEET OF HIGH WE DON'T WANT

IT'S JUST VERY VERY FRUSTRATING

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:33.044

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:35.312

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.514
ADDRESSING ONE PORTION OF

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:20.017

DISTRICT AND I HAVE THIS MIXED

00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:26.657
OF FEELING OF NOT ON YOUR BILL

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:29.426
BUT JUST ON THE IMPACTS OF

00:40:29.493 --> 00:40:32.363
EIGHTY USE WE HAVE THOSE WHO

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:33.564

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.143
BE- AND YOU KNOW BRING IN A LOT

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.111
OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE TOOK TO

IN THE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ALSO

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:54.718
LOING TERM THEY REALLY BUILD

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:56.587
THEM HOWEVER THEY CAN PATCH IT

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:58.522
TOGETHER AND IT BECOMES THAT. SO

00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:59.957

THOUGHTS ON HOW THIS COULD FIT

00:41:19.009 --> 00:41:20.744
IN AND HELP SO THERE'S A

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:22.213
PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT WILL

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:23.614
ALLOW THE HOUSING COMMUNITY

00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:25.416

THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK OUT IF

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:38.963

00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:47.257
THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT WERE

PEOPLE DECIDED FOR WHATEVER

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:51.829
REASON THAT THEY WOULD BUILD IT.

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:53.797
THAT WAS NOT SUBSTANDARD HOUSING

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:55.065
WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:56.934

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:59.570
BUILT FOR THE CODE AT THE TIME

00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:01.605
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE SAID

00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:03.841
WE NEEDED A PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE

00:44:03.907 --> 00:44:05.943

00:44:14.184 --> 00:44:16.020
SAFETY THAT IT IN WHICH IS WHAT

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:17.488
HAPPENS NOW IF YOU BUILDING

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:18.789
INSPECTOR GOES INTO A RENTAL

00:44:18.856 --> 00:44:20.090
UNIT BECAUSE- THE CITY OR

00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:22.026
JURISDICTION. NORMALLY WHAT THEY

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:23.994
DO IS THEY LOOK AROUND OUT OF

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:25.929
WALLS PEELING DOWN THEY TAKE THE

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:27.164
THEIR GADGET AND PUT IT IN ONE

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:29.266
OF THE PLUGS TO SEE IF THE

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:30.734
ELECTRICITY IS GROUNDED IF IT'S

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:32.102
NOT GROUNDEDTHE SAY YOU GOT A

00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:33.837
GROUNDOUT RIGHT SO THEY THEY DO

00:44:33.904 --> 00:44:36.707
THAT BUT THEY DON'T. COME IN AND

00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:38.375
RIP UP THE- THE WHOLE HOUSE

00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:40.244
BECAUSE IT WAS BUILT. IN

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:41.378
NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND IT'S

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:42.880
FORTY HER IS ALSO AT NINETEEN

00:44:42.946 --> 00:44:44.448

THAT'S THE PATHWAY AND WE'RE

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:46.984
HAVING WE'RE HAVING SOME SUCCESS

00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:49.386
BECAUSE SOME. WE WANT THOSE. TO

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:55.292
REASON SO WE DON'T. AND IN MY

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.327
YOU KNOW I DISAGREE WITH SOME OF

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:58.495

BUT IN TERMS OF THE STATE. WHAT

01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:11.846
THAT REPRESENTS IS ALL WE'RE

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:13.581
DOING IS THROWING MONEY AT THAT

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:17.685

01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:45.814
ATTEMPT TO BRING SOME SETS.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:49.083
SENSE AND PURPOSE TO DEALING

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:51.886
WITH THE HOMELESS. THERE'S BEEN

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:54.355
A RECENTLY LAUNCHED HOMELESS

AS A STEP FURTHER INTO THE

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:14.309
DIRECTION WHICH OTHER STATES

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.478
HAVE ALREADY TAKEN INCLUDING

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:18.012
WASHINGTON WHICH TRACKS ALL

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:19.814

EVERY HOMELESS PROJECT. IN THE

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:23.651
STATE FROM EVERY FUNDING SOURCE

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:26.154
TO IDENTIFY SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:28.189
ON WHICH IT COULD EXPAND AND

01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:32.760
FOCUS ON GREATER EFFORT. EXPEND

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:34.629
FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR SUCH

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:38.399
PURPOSES. THIS BILL WAS INSPIRED

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:39.334
BY THE FINDINGS AND

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.336
RECOMMENDATIONS OF TWO STATE

TWENTY TWENTY SIX. ONE WAS IN

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:53.982
TWENTY TWENTY. IT IS IMPORTANT

01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:55.216
TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT WE'RE

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:58.953
DOING. IT HAS DISTURBED ME AS

PARTICULAR COMMUNITY. AND THIS

01:26:18.306 --> 01:26:21.075

01:46:27.714 --> 01:46:28.915
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT

01:46:28.982 --> 01:46:30.650
BEING PUT INTO OTHER ELEMENTS OF

01:47:42.455 --> 01:47:43.223

02:10:24.783 --> 02:10:27.953
CALIFORNIA. AT HOUSING CRISIS IS

02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:29.821
BROADLY STALKED ABOUT ENOUGH

02:10:29.888 --> 02:10:30.956
PLACE NOT ENOUGH PLACES FOR

02:10:31.023 --> 02:10:33.225
PEOPLE TO LIVE IN WE'RE NOT

02:10:33.292 --> 02:10:33.959
BUILDING AND THEN ANOTHER

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:35.627
HOUSING NOW WHAT IS THAT HOUSING

02:10:35.694 --> 02:10:37.262
LOOK LIKE IS IT ALL TAX

02:10:37.329 --> 02:10:38.964
SUBSIDIZED. AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:10:39.031 --> 02:10:40.799
WARS ARE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:42.768
TO HAVE HOME OWNERSHIP AND SO

02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:44.670
THIS BILL KIND OF TURNS THE

02:10:44.736 --> 02:10:45.904
ARGUMENT I HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S

02:10:45.971 --> 02:10:47.806
HOUSING PLAN HERE HOW MANY

02:10:47.873 --> 02:10:49.908
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE SPENDING

02:10:49.975 --> 02:10:51.910
OF TAX DOLLARS ON HOUSING BUT

02:10:51.977 --> 02:10:53.879
THIS TURNS THE IDEA ON ITS HEAD.

02:10:53.946 --> 02:10:55.814
IT BASICALLY HAS CERTAIN VERY

02:10:55.881 --> 02:10:57.916
CORE ELEMENTS OF WHAT WE'RE

02:10:57.983 --> 02:11:00.152
TRYING TO DO FIRST WE WANT TO

02:11:00.219 --> 02:11:01.853
INCREASE PRODUCTION WE DON'T

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:03.689
WANT TO JUST HAVE A PLAN THAT

02:11:03.755 --> 02:11:04.957
JUST SAYS YOU CAN BUY YOUR

02:11:05.023 --> 02:11:06.091
GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE BECAUSE WE

02:11:06.158 --> 02:11:07.993
HAVE AN AD THE NEW HOUSING AND

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:09.895
SECONDLY WHEN SOME FAMILY THAT

02:11:09.962 --> 02:11:11.697
COMES INTO BY THE HOUSE IT LEAKY

02:11:11.763 --> 02:11:13.098
PIPES AND LEAKY ROOF SHE WANNA

02:11:13.165 --> 02:11:14.600
GIVE A BRAND NEW CONSTRUCTION.

02:11:14.666 --> 02:11:16.168
SO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE

02:11:16.235 --> 02:11:18.770
OUT HOW YOU CAN HAVE A HOUSING

02:11:18.837 --> 02:11:20.038
PLAN THAT RESULTS IN MORE

02:11:20.105 --> 02:11:21.106
CONSTRUCTION TO YOU WANT TO HAVE

02:11:21.173 --> 02:11:23.308
A HOUSING PLAN THAT DOESN'T COST

02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:24.776
TAXPAYERS MONEY BECAUSE EVEN

02:11:24.843 --> 02:11:26.678
THOUGH WE HAVE A SURPLUS NOW THE

02:11:26.745 --> 02:11:28.614
BOTTOM LINE IS IT DOESN'T HAVE

02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:30.148
LAST FOR EVER THOSE OF US WHO'VE

02:11:30.215 --> 02:11:32.117
BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME WE SEE

02:11:32.184 --> 02:11:34.119
THAT GO UP AND DOWN. AND WE SEEN

02:11:34.186 --> 02:11:34.953
THAT THERE'S OTHER BIG

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:36.421
CHALLENGES FOR GOVERNMENT TO

02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:38.557
SPEND ITS RESOURCES CAN YOU COME

02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:39.891
UP WITH SOMETHING WITHOUT USING

02:11:39.958 --> 02:11:42.628
TAX DOLLARS THAT CREATE HOUSING

02:11:42.694 --> 02:11:45.564
THIRD WE WANT TO PUT GOOD JOBS

02:11:45.631 --> 02:11:48.133
PEPLE TO WORK AND WE WANT THIS

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.468
TO ALL BE SKILLED AND TRAINED

02:11:49.534 --> 02:11:50.535
WORKFORCE. AND THERE'S ALWAYS AN

02:11:50.602 --> 02:11:51.803
ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT THE HOUSING

02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:53.572
SECTOR WITH RESPECT TO SKILLED

02:11:53.639 --> 02:11:55.140
AND TRAINED WORKFORCE BUT WE

02:11:55.207 --> 02:11:56.908
THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN AND WE

02:11:56.975 --> 02:11:57.976
THINK BY HAVING A SKILLED AND

02:11:58.043 --> 02:11:59.177
TRAINED WORKFORCE JUST LIKE I

02:11:59.244 --> 02:12:01.380
SAID WITH THE LAST BILL YOU GET

02:12:01.446 --> 02:12:02.781
BETTER QUALITY CONSTRUCTION SO

02:12:02.848 --> 02:12:04.950
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A TEN

02:12:05.017 --> 02:12:06.518
YEAR LAKE DEFECT LAW BECAUSE YOU

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:07.986
GOT. YOU GOT THE BETTER WORK YOU

02:12:08.053 --> 02:12:10.322
COULD DO THINGS IN A BETTER AND

02:12:10.389 --> 02:12:11.123
MORE INTELLIGENT WAY AND YOU'RE

02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:13.258
NOT CREATING A SITUATION WHERE

02:12:13.325 --> 02:12:15.260
IN LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE IF

02:12:15.327 --> 02:12:17.162
SOMEONE MAKES MINIMUM WAGE THEY

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:18.997
CAN'T AFFORD A TWO BEDROOM HOUSE

02:12:19.064 --> 02:12:21.433
MAYKOP APARTMENT EXCUSE ME AND

02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:22.534
THE LAST THING IS MOST

02:12:22.601 --> 02:12:26.705
IMPORTANTLY I'M TRYING TO DEAL

02:12:26.772 --> 02:12:27.973
WITH THE RICH POOR DIVIDE THE

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:29.207
WEALTH GAP. HE KILLING OUR TO.

02:12:29.274 --> 02:12:30.242
THE RICHER GETTING RICHER. AND

02:12:30.309 --> 02:12:32.744
THE POOR GETTING POORER. HOME IS

02:12:32.811 --> 02:12:34.513
WHERE TE WEALTHIEST IF YOU GIVE

02:12:34.579 --> 02:12:36.615
PEOPLE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN A HOME

02:12:36.682 --> 02:12:38.850
INSTEAD OF AFTER TEN YEARS OR

02:12:38.917 --> 02:12:40.786
TWENTY YEARS ALL THEY GOT IS A

02:12:40.852 --> 02:12:42.287
BIGGER RENT BILL. THEY MIGHT

02:12:42.354 --> 02:12:42.921
HAVE SOME EQUITY HOW MANY

02:12:42.988 --> 02:12:44.423
FAMILIES IN PEOPLE'S LIVES HAVE

02:12:44.489 --> 02:12:46.058
BEEN CHANGED BECAUSE- NOT ONLY

02:12:46.124 --> 02:12:48.026

TO BUILD WEALTH. SO HOW DO YOU

02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:52.864
STRUCTURE THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:12:52.931 --> 02:12:55.334
WORKING WELL OVER A YEAR WITH A

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:56.501
COALITION OF LABOR AND BUSINESS

02:12:56.568 --> 02:12:59.104
AND- AND LAWYERS AND THE LIKE.

02:12:59.171 --> 02:13:01.373
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HOW WE

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.141
WOULD DO THAT. AND WHAT YOU HAVE

02:13:03.208 --> 02:13:05.477
BEFORE YOU IS A TWENTY FIVE

02:13:05.544 --> 02:13:07.312
BILLION DOLLAR BOND. AND IT'S A

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:09.348
G. O. BOND DEAL MEANS GENERAL

02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:10.949
OBLIGATION. WHAT WE DO AND WHY

02:13:11.016 --> 02:13:13.251
DO WE HAVE A JOB ON MOST YOU'LL

02:13:13.318 --> 02:13:14.753
BONDS MEAN THAT THE TAXPAYERS

02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:16.121
PAY THE MONEY THIS IS CALLED THE

02:13:16.188 --> 02:13:17.956
SELF LIQUIDATING GEO BOND WHY DO

02:13:18.023 --> 02:13:20.359
WE GO TO THE VOTERS FOR GEO BOND

02:13:20.425 --> 02:13:21.827
WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE PAID FOR

02:13:21.893 --> 02:13:23.395
THE MONEY COMES FROM INVESTORS

02:13:23.462 --> 02:13:25.130
AND IT'S GOING TO BE PAID BACK

02:13:25.197 --> 02:13:26.865
TO INVESTORS. WE DID IT BECAUSE

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:28.400
BY HAVING THE FULL FAITH AND

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:29.801
CREDIT OF THE STATE OF

02:13:29.868 --> 02:13:31.136
CALIFORNIA YOU BY LOWER INTEREST

02:13:31.203 --> 02:13:33.305
RATE. IF YOU BUY A LOWER

02:13:33.372 --> 02:13:34.306
INTEREST RATE YOU REDUCE THE

02:13:34.373 --> 02:13:36.174
COSTS IF YOU INCREASING COST

02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:37.042
OVER HERE BECAUSE THE

02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:38.143
CONSTRUCTION COST BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:13:38.210 --> 02:13:39.778
PAYING A FEW DOLLARS TO FAITH

FAIR WAGES OVER HERE IF YOU CAN

IS BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING

02:13:47.386 --> 02:13:49.388
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE WAY THE

02:13:49.454 --> 02:13:50.655
PROGRAM WORKS. SOMEBODY WILL GO

02:13:50.722 --> 02:13:52.357
TO THE LOCAL BUT BUILT THE

02:13:52.424 --> 02:13:53.291

IMPROVEMENTS FOR COMMUNITIES

02:14:16.615 --> 02:14:18.717
THAT DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE ALL

02:14:18.784 --> 02:14:20.852
THE IMPROVEMENTS. THEN THE CUT

02:14:20.919 --> 02:14:22.320
WHAT IS THE CUSTOMER GET

02:14:22.387 --> 02:14:24.456
CUSTOMER GOES TO THE BANK AND

02:14:24.523 --> 02:14:26.725
THEY HAVE A CREDIT REPORT AND

02:14:26.792 --> 02:14:27.959
THEY'VE GOT INCOME BECAUSE

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:30.429
THEY'RE WORKING FOR THE STATE OF

02:14:30.495 --> 02:14:31.096
THE WORKING FOR WHATEVER IT MAY

02:14:31.163 --> 02:14:32.998
BE COULD BE STAFFER HERE IN THE

02:14:33.064 --> 02:14:34.733
BUILDING. AND THEY NOW ALL OF A

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:36.034
SUDDEN COULD AFFORD TO BUY THIS

02:14:36.101 --> 02:14:37.836

COME UP WITH THE SCRATCH TO COME

02:14:42.207 --> 02:14:44.309
UP WITH A DOWN PAYMENT SO WE'RE

02:14:44.376 --> 02:14:45.377
GONNA LOAN PEOPLE UP TO A

02:14:45.444 --> 02:14:47.045
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE THOUSAND

02:14:47.112 --> 02:14:48.113
DOLLARS- BASICALLY THE ONLY HAVE

02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:50.081
TO PUT 1% DOWN AND THE REASON WE

02:14:50.148 --> 02:14:51.950
DID ONE PERCENT. IS WE FOUND

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:52.984
THAT FROM ALL THE DATA IF

02:14:53.051 --> 02:14:54.753
SOMEBODY HAS SOME SKIN IN THE

02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:56.121
GAME SO TO SPEAK 1% OR SEVEN

02:14:56.188 --> 02:14:57.689
FIFTY THOUSAND HOUSE THEY PUT

02:14:57.756 --> 02:14:59.624
SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOWN

WE PUT THE OTHER HUNDRED FIFTY

02:15:00.725 --> 02:15:01.927
THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS DOWN. AND

02:15:01.993 --> 02:15:04.062
ALL THEY CAN GET THE HOUSE AND

02:15:04.129 --> 02:15:05.063
THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENT OF A

02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:06.798
FIXED MORTGAGE MEANS THAT THAT I

02:15:06.865 --> 02:15:08.200
COULD HAVE RENT INCREASES THE

02:15:08.266 --> 02:15:13.171
WHOLE. WORLD CHANGES FOR THEM

02:15:13.238 --> 02:15:14.139
THEIR LIFE CHANGED THEIR FAMILY

02:15:14.206 --> 02:15:15.106
TREE. AND SO. WHAT HAPPENS HOW

DO YOU PAY BACK HOW DO YOU GET

02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:18.977
THE STATE HOW DOES THE INVESTOR

02:15:19.044 --> 02:15:20.278
GET THEIR HUNDRED FIFTY THREE

02:15:20.345 --> 02:15:21.780
THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK. GOOD

02:15:21.847 --> 02:15:23.215
QUESTION. THERE'S GOING TO BE A

02:15:23.281 --> 02:15:23.915
LIEN AGAINST THE HOUSE THE

02:15:23.982 --> 02:15:25.116
SECOND TRUSTEE. AND WHEN THE

02:15:25.183 --> 02:15:26.818
HOUSE IS SOLD ADVERTISE TIME IS

02:15:26.885 --> 02:15:28.019
NINE YEARS WE FIGURED OUT THE

02:15:28.086 --> 02:15:30.121
MECHANICS IN THE MONEY. SO WITH

02:15:30.188 --> 02:15:32.023
HOUSES SOLD THE GETS PAID BACK

02:15:32.090 --> 02:15:32.657
THERE'S IMPUTED INTEREST OF A

02:15:32.724 --> 02:15:33.792
COUPLE PERCENT. AND GET PAID

02:15:33.859 --> 02:15:35.026
BACK MOST OF THE MAKE THE

02:15:35.093 --> 02:15:37.095
MAJORITY OF THE MONEY WILL GO TO

02:15:37.162 --> 02:15:37.963
THE- HOMEOWNER FOR INCREASE.

02:15:38.029 --> 02:15:39.264
THERE'S NO INCREASE THEN THERE'S

02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:40.866
NO RISK. THE A AND WE'RE

02:15:40.932 --> 02:15:43.001
BUILDING THE NECESSARY- LEVERS

02:15:43.068 --> 02:15:44.336
INTO THE PROGRAM TO MAKE IT

02:15:44.402 --> 02:15:46.271
WORK. SO BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S

02:15:46.338 --> 02:15:48.306
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO WE

02:15:48.373 --> 02:15:50.008
DEAL SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE

02:15:50.075 --> 02:15:51.543
THORNIEST PROBLEMS TO ME THE

02:15:51.610 --> 02:15:53.345
THORNIEST PROBLEMS IS. WE'VE GOT

02:15:53.411 --> 02:15:54.880
TO CREATE WEALTH FOR PEOPLE.

02:15:54.946 --> 02:15:56.314
BECAUSE WHICH JUST GETTING WORSE

BE HOMEWORK IN THIS WOMEN

02:16:30.615 --> 02:16:32.784
LOOKING AT THE SIZING OF IT NOW.

02:16:32.851 --> 02:16:34.319
THE OPPOSITION COMES IN AND SAYS

02:16:34.386 --> 02:16:35.954
THIS. IS ALL THE OPPOSITION

02:16:36.021 --> 02:16:37.589
WONDERFUL PEOPLE TO WORK WITH

02:16:37.656 --> 02:16:38.957
FOREVER. SAYING WELL YOU'RE

02:16:39.024 --> 02:16:40.825
GONNA FREEZE OUT THE BOND MARKET

02:16:40.892 --> 02:16:43.562
BECAUSE- WE WANT MONEY FOR TAX

02:16:43.628 --> 02:16:46.598
DOLLARS. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:16:46.665 --> 02:16:48.900
YEAH I GET IT. I GET IT. BUT IT

02:16:48.967 --> 02:16:50.802
TOTALLY KILLS THE ARCHITECTURE

02:16:50.869 --> 02:16:52.771
OF THIS DEAL BECAUSE OUR WHOLE

02:16:52.837 --> 02:16:54.039
PURPOSE IS NOT TO GO TO

02:16:54.105 --> 02:16:55.273
TAXPAYERS AND SAY YOU SHOULD

02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:57.008
PAY. WE DON'T WANT IF YOU GO OUT

02:16:57.075 --> 02:16:58.977
AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO SAY AND

02:16:59.044 --> 02:17:00.045
SPEND FIVE BILLION OR TEN

02:17:00.111 --> 02:17:01.146
BILLION DOLLARS FOR HOUSING

02:17:01.212 --> 02:17:02.814
BONDS. WHAT THAT MEANS IS EVERY

02:17:02.881 --> 02:17:04.950
YEAR COULD HAVE A MORE A PAYMENT

02:17:05.016 --> 02:17:06.251
ON YOUR GENERAL FUND THAT COMES

02:17:06.318 --> 02:17:07.185
AHEAD OF EVERYTHING ELSE. EVERY

02:17:07.252 --> 02:17:11.089
SALARY EVERY OTHER EXPENSE

02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:12.157
EVERYTHING FOR FOSTER CARE AND

02:17:12.223 --> 02:17:13.825
EVERYTHING ELSE. IN AN WE'RE

02:17:13.892 --> 02:17:15.060
GONNA HAVE TO CROWD OUT OTHER IT

02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:17.195
COSTS. AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN

02:17:17.262 --> 02:17:18.763
WE CAN'T SELL IT IS NOT A COST

02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:20.065
TO THE TAXPAYER. BUT IT'S REALLY

02:17:20.131 --> 02:17:22.100
GOING TO BE A TAXPAYER DEAL. AND

02:17:22.167 --> 02:17:24.235
SO I GET THE FACT THAT FOLKS

02:17:24.302 --> 02:17:25.170
THAT ARE IN THE AFFORDABLE

02:17:25.236 --> 02:17:26.504
HOUSING BUSINESS WANT TO- YOU

02:17:26.571 --> 02:17:28.573
KNOW GIVES TAX DOLLARS AND SAY.

02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:29.274
YOU SHOULDN'T JUST GO TO

02:17:29.341 --> 02:17:31.109
HOMEOWNERSHIP. BUT THIS IS THE

02:17:31.176 --> 02:17:33.211
MISSING MIDDLE THIS IS THE

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:34.913
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE. TO BE

02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:37.015
ABLE TO GET ON THE LADDER. YOU

02:17:37.082 --> 02:17:38.950
KNOW BECAUSE THE END OF THE DAY.

02:17:39.017 --> 02:17:41.586
I MEAN IF I HAD MY DRUTHERS

02:17:41.653 --> 02:17:42.587
WOULD NEVER BE ANOTHER

02:17:42.654 --> 02:17:43.288
APARTMENT. EVERYBODY WOULD OWN

02:17:43.355 --> 02:17:45.023
EVERYBODY HAVE A CONDOMINIUM OR

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:47.659
A COOPER SOMETHING. OPPORTUNITY

02:17:47.726 --> 02:17:50.128
TO MAKE WEALTH BECAUSE- LASTING

02:17:50.195 --> 02:17:52.197
A CLOSE ON THIS WHEN YOU HAVE AN

02:17:52.263 --> 02:17:53.331
APARTMENT. YOU GOT THAT

02:17:53.398 --> 02:17:54.232
TAXPAYERS PICKING UP THE TAB FOR

02:17:54.299 --> 02:17:56.334
ALL THE SUBSIDIES AND GUESS WHAT

02:17:56.401 --> 02:17:57.302
HAPPENS AFTER TWENTY YEARS. THE

02:17:57.369 --> 02:17:59.104
RENT GOES UP WITH THE RENT GOES

02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:01.539
UP. BIG BURDEN ON THE PERSON

02:18:01.606 --> 02:18:02.140
ISN'T WHO'S A RENTER. SECOND

02:18:02.207 --> 02:18:03.408
THING THAT HAPPENS IS. THE

02:18:03.475 --> 02:18:04.709
LANDLORD GETS RICH BECAUSE THE

02:18:04.776 --> 02:18:06.645
VALUE DEPARTMENT GOES UP. SO WE

02:18:06.711 --> 02:18:08.013
SPENDING ALL THE MONEY WE'RE

02:18:08.079 --> 02:18:09.280
CREATINGALL THESE COVENANTS

02:18:09.347 --> 02:18:11.616
THEY GET TO MAKE THE DOUGH. AND

02:18:11.683 --> 02:18:13.018
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF

WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO BUILD

02:18:15.387 --> 02:18:16.321
EQUITY SOCIETY GOES AWAY. SO

02:18:16.388 --> 02:18:18.256
THIS IS IT. I THINK A PRETTY

02:18:18.323 --> 02:18:20.759

OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE'VE

02:30:30.955 --> 02:30:32.289

SO HIGH AS WE HAVE A SUPPLY AND

02:30:34.358 --> 02:30:37.128

02:44:57.821 --> 02:44:59.556
THESE AREAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTED

02:44:59.623 --> 02:45:01.258
THIS ADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES THE

02:45:01.324 --> 02:45:03.226
LEVEL OF BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE

02:45:03.293 --> 02:45:06.162
AND SERVICES IS MINIMAL IF IT

02:45:06.229 --> 02:45:08.331
EXISTS AT ALL. TO ILLUSTRATE THE

02:45:08.398 --> 02:45:09.933
NEED FOR THIS BILL I ASK YOU TO

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:11.501
PUT YOURSELF IN THE SHOES OF

02:45:11.568 --> 02:45:13.503
SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN A POOR

02:45:13.570 --> 02:45:14.371
RURAL AN INCORPORATED AREA.

02:45:14.437 --> 02:45:15.639
IMAGINE A PARENT WALKING THEIR

02:45:15.705 --> 02:45:17.274
CHILDREN TO SCHOOL ONE DAY AFTER

02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:19.142
A HEAVY NIGHT OF RAIN. BECAUSE

02:45:19.209 --> 02:45:20.710
THE COMMUNITY LACKS PROPER

02:45:20.777 --> 02:45:22.779
SIDEWALKS AND STORM DRAINAGE THE

02:45:22.846 --> 02:45:24.247
FAMILY IS FORCED TO WALK IN THE

02:45:24.314 --> 02:45:26.316
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD IN ORDER TO

02:45:26.383 --> 02:45:27.384
AVOID FLOODED- MANY AREAS ON THE

02:45:27.450 --> 02:45:29.753
SIDE OF THE ROAD THE TYPICALLY

02:45:29.819 --> 02:45:31.921
SERVE AS PEDESTRIAN PATHS. THIS

02:45:31.988 --> 02:45:33.556
IS THE REALITY FOR MANY PEOPLE

02:45:33.623 --> 02:45:35.058
LIVING IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS

02:45:35.125 --> 02:45:36.826
AT NIGHT I'VE SEEN IT I'VE BEEN

02:45:36.893 --> 02:45:38.962
IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS- AFTER A

02:45:39.029 --> 02:45:41.631
RAINY DAY AND- I WAS SHOCKED. TO

02:45:41.698 --> 02:45:43.233
SEE PARENTS WALKING THEIR

02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:45.001
CHILDREN DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE

02:45:45.068 --> 02:45:45.902
STREET. BECAUSE HE'S COMMUNITIES

02:45:45.969 --> 02:45:47.470
DO NOT HAVE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:45:47.537 --> 02:45:48.638
TO PROVIDE SERVICES THEY MUST

02:45:48.705 --> 02:45:50.774
MAKE DO WITH WHAT LITTLE PUBLIC

02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:51.675
HEALTH AND SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE

02:45:51.741 --> 02:45:53.243
EXISTS. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE

02:45:53.310 --> 02:45:54.944
LEVEL OF SERVICE PROVIDED WITHIN

02:45:55.011 --> 02:45:56.680
A CITY VERSES WITHIN AN

02:45:56.746 --> 02:45:58.648
UNINCORPORATED AREA IS EVEN MORE

02:45:58.715 --> 02:46:00.083
NOTICEABLE IN THE AREA HAPPENS

02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:02.752
TO BE FULLY SURROUNDED BY CITIES

02:46:02.819 --> 02:46:03.420
BOUNDARIES. CREATING AN

02:46:03.486 --> 02:46:05.588
UNINCORPORATED ISLAND. IN MANY

02:46:05.655 --> 02:46:07.123
CASES LEADING RIGHT UP TO THE

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:08.725
BOUNDARIES OF THE ISLAND THERE

02:46:08.792 --> 02:46:10.560
WILL BE PAVED ROADS SIDEWALKS

02:46:10.627 --> 02:46:11.828
CURBS GUTTERS AND STREET LIGHTS

02:46:11.895 --> 02:46:14.097
ONLY TO STOP. IMMEDIATELY UPON

02:46:14.164 --> 02:46:15.598
ENTERING THE BOUNDARIES AT THE

02:46:15.665 --> 02:46:17.867
END INCORPORATED HIGHLAND. AND

02:46:17.934 --> 02:46:20.136
TO CONTINUE ON AGAIN WITH CITY

02:46:20.203 --> 02:46:22.972
SERVICES AFTER EXITING THAT THAT

02:46:23.039 --> 02:46:24.574
ISLAND. WELL EXISTING LAW

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:26.242
PREVENTS THE CITY FROM

02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:27.844
LEAPFROGGING OVER AN

02:46:27.911 --> 02:46:29.212
INCORPORATED AREAS WHEN

02:46:29.279 --> 02:46:31.781
EXPANDING THEIR BORDERS TODAY.

02:46:31.848 --> 02:46:33.750
THE INCORPORATED ISLANDS CREATED

02:46:33.817 --> 02:46:35.151
FROM YEARS OF CITIES PICKING AND

02:46:35.218 --> 02:46:37.120
CHOOSING WHICH AREAS THEY WISH

02:46:37.187 --> 02:46:39.222
TO ANNEX REMAINS. THIS IN PART

02:46:39.289 --> 02:46:40.990
IS DUE TO THE COST TO BUILD AND

02:46:41.057 --> 02:46:42.459
CONNECT THE COMMUNITY THE CITY

02:46:42.525 --> 02:46:44.160
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH CREATED A

02:46:44.227 --> 02:46:46.162
DISINCENTIVE FOR SISTER CITIES

02:46:46.229 --> 02:46:47.797
TO PURSUE ANNEXATION. THAT'S WHY

02:46:47.864 --> 02:46:50.133
I'VE INTRODUCED SB FOURTEEN

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:51.234

THESE UNINCORPORATED AREAS AND

02:46:56.206 --> 02:46:57.807
PROVIDE THE BASIC NEEDS THAT

02:46:57.874 --> 02:47:00.043
MOST PEOPLE TAKE FOR GRANTED. AS

02:47:00.110 --> 02:47:01.745
A WAY TO ELIMINATE THESE ISLANDS

02:47:01.811 --> 02:47:06.249
SPECIFICALLY SB FOURTEEN FORTY-

02:47:06.316 --> 02:47:07.984

UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES AND A

02:47:36.513 --> 02:47:37.947
WORK WITH SPECIFIC STAKEHOLDERS

02:48:00.570 --> 02:48:02.472
ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT- I KNOW

02:48:02.539 --> 02:48:04.407
WE'VE HAD A LONG HEARING SO I'LL

02:48:04.474 --> 02:48:06.109
TRY TO LIMIT MY ENTHUSIASM AND

02:48:06.176 --> 02:48:08.044
KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT I DO

02:48:08.111 --> 02:48:09.512
REALLY LIKE THIS BILL AND ONE OF

02:48:09.579 --> 02:48:11.748
THE REASONS I LIKE IT SO MUCH AS

02:48:11.815 --> 02:48:13.983
I THINK BACK TO MY TIME IN LOCAL

02:48:14.050 --> 02:48:14.584
GOVERNMENT. WORKING WITH THE

02:48:14.651 --> 02:48:16.286
COUNTY WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES

02:48:16.352 --> 02:48:17.887
THAT WOULD DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM

02:48:17.954 --> 02:48:19.923
PROGRAM LIKE THIS I THINK ABOUT

02:48:19.989 --> 02:48:21.925
A MOBILE HOME PARK SURROUNDED ON

02:48:21.991 --> 02:48:24.794
THREE SIDES BY A CITY AND ON ONE

02:48:24.861 --> 02:48:25.595
SIDE BY ACTUALLY THE NEIGHBORING

02:48:25.662 --> 02:48:27.564
COUNTY HUGE PROBLEMS WITH

02:48:27.630 --> 02:48:29.165
SERVICES EVEN JUST GETTING THE

02:48:29.232 --> 02:48:30.667
SHERIFF TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE

02:48:30.733 --> 02:48:32.302
OF THE PHYSICAL ISOLATION I

02:48:32.368 --> 02:48:33.803
THINK AOUT A COMMUNITY THAT'S

02:48:33.870 --> 02:48:35.405
LOCATED JUST ACROSS THE STREET

02:48:35.472 --> 02:48:37.407
FROM A CITY BUT DOESN'T HAVE

02:48:37.474 --> 02:48:39.676
WATER AND SEWER SERVICE. EXCEPT

02:48:39.742 --> 02:48:41.711
FOR VERY LIMITED AND-

02:48:41.778 --> 02:48:43.913
SUBSTANDARD SYSTEM THESE ARE THE

02:48:43.980 --> 02:48:45.248
TYPES OF COMMUNITIES IN THE

02:48:45.315 --> 02:48:47.050
TYPES OF DISPARITIES THAT SB

02:48:47.116 --> 02:48:48.651
FOURTEEN FORTY NINE WILL HELP TO

02:48:48.718 --> 02:48:50.220
REMEDY AND SO I THINK IT'S

02:48:50.286 --> 02:48:51.020
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHY DO

02:48:51.087 --> 02:48:52.989
WE HAVE SOME OF THESE

02:48:53.056 --> 02:48:53.857
DISCREPANCIES SO MANY OF THESE

02:48:53.923 --> 02:48:56.226
AREAS MAY HAVE BEEN BUILT BEFORE

02:48:56.292 --> 02:48:56.960
TODAY'S MODERN STANDARDS FOR

02:48:57.026 --> 02:48:57.760
IMPROVEMENTS THEY MIGHT OF USE

02:48:57.827 --> 02:48:59.162
LOOPHOLES LIKE FOR BY BORING OR

02:48:59.229 --> 02:49:01.431
A PARCEL MAP OR I'D ANTIQUATED

02:49:01.498 --> 02:49:03.132
SUBDIVISION TO GET AROUND. THE

02:49:03.199 --> 02:49:04.968
BUILT BUILDING ENVIRONMENT IN

02:49:05.034 --> 02:49:06.236
TERMS OF PRODUCING THOSE

02:49:06.302 --> 02:49:08.338
SIDEWALKS AND OTHER OFFSITE

02:49:08.404 --> 02:49:08.905
IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE OFTEN

02:49:08.972 --> 02:49:11.307
NEEDED A LOT OF THE

02:49:11.374 --> 02:49:12.375
INCORPORATORS AREAS LACK THE TAX

02:49:12.442 --> 02:49:14.744
BASE THEY GET A SMALL SHARE OF

02:49:14.811 --> 02:49:15.945
THE PROPERTY TAX THE AREAS THAT

02:49:16.012 --> 02:49:17.347
HAVE A LOT OF SALES TAX ARE

02:49:17.413 --> 02:49:19.315
USUALLY THE FIRST ONES TO GET

02:49:19.382 --> 02:49:20.116
ANNEXED AND SO WHERE YOU

02:49:20.183 --> 02:49:22.519
TYPICALLY SEE A HIGHER LEVEL OF

02:49:22.585 --> 02:49:23.419
SERVICE IN THE UNINCORPORATED

02:49:23.486 --> 02:49:25.255
ZONE IS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE VOTED

02:49:25.321 --> 02:49:27.390
TO TAX THEMSELVES ARE. FORMER

02:49:27.457 --> 02:49:28.491
SPECIAL DISTRICT TO PROVIDE A

02:49:28.558 --> 02:49:30.360
HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE IN THESE

02:49:30.426 --> 02:49:31.728
COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE

02:49:31.794 --> 02:49:33.196
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT THEY'RE

02:49:33.263 --> 02:49:34.330
REALLY COMPETING AGAINST EVERY

02:49:34.397 --> 02:49:35.798
OTHER USE OF GENERAL FUND

02:49:35.865 --> 02:49:37.467

02:49:37.534 --> 02:49:39.469
AT THE COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN

SERVICES PUBLIC SAFETY ETCETERA.

02:49:41.304 --> 02:49:42.639
SO REALLY SMETIMES THE BEST

02:49:42.705 --> 02:49:44.173
OPTION FOR THESE COMMUNITIES IS

02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:46.476
ANNEXATION INTO THE CITY BUT WHY

02:49:46.543 --> 02:49:47.944
ISN'T THAT HAPPENING SOONER

02:49:48.011 --> 02:49:49.345
CABALLERO DIGNIFIED ONE OF THE

02:49:49.412 --> 02:49:51.014
KEY ISSUES WHICH IS THE COST OF

02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:54.584
