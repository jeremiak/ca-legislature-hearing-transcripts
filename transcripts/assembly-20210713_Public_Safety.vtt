01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:46.442
SOMEWHAT OBJECTIVE AND I I'VE I

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:50.012

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.514
ON AN ANTI LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:55.051

SMARTEST THING YOU'VE GOT.

NOT HAVE A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:19.108

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:56.579
IMPORTANT THINGS IN THIS. NOW I

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:05.821
SUGGESTIONS ABOUT- ESSENTIALLY

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:08.824
REFINING YOUR BILL FOR EXAMPLE

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:10.292

THE LAW IN THAT AREA OR NOT-

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:23.005
THURMOND WHICH YOU COULD TAKE-

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:24.740

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:28.611
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SCALI

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:30.846
HEARINGS. THERE'S A PROCEDURE

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:33.416
WHERE AFTER THE FIRST GOLLY

01:07:33.482 --> 01:07:36.018

SUPERIOR COURT. IT'S HARD TO

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:45.828
BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD BE

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.963
DIFFERENCES HERE SO THESE ARE

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.365
SOME OF THE THINGS POINTED OUT

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:53.269
THE ANALYSIS AND I THINK THAT

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:59.442

POTENTIALLY MORE MORE TO COME I

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:50.920
THINK THERE WILL BE THAT-

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:51.921
HOPEFULLY WHEN WE PASS IT

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:53.088
THROUGH OUR HOUSES THERE WILL

01:09:53.155 --> 01:09:53.989
BE THAT AFTER WHERE PEOPLE SAY

PROCESS BEFORE I EVEN GOT HERE

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:03.299
LAST SUMMER WHEN I THINK THERE

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:04.934
WAS A GREAT MOMENTUM. AND GREAT

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.569
INTEREST IN THE PUBLIC AND NOW

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:07.670
PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHY DID WE DO

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:09.038
LAST YEAR SO NOW WE'RE BACK AT

01:10:09.104 --> 01:10:10.239
IT AGAIN AND I REALLY DO HOPE

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:11.340
THAT WE MAKE THE STRONGER AND

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:12.341
MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROCESS

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:14.143
DOES WORK. IT'S GOT SIX STEP SO

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:15.244
WE HAVE SOME TIME TO SEE IF IT

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:16.679
REALLY WORKS OUT AND WE CAN

01:10:16.745 --> 01:10:17.846
WORK AND WORK IT OUT AND IRON

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:20.049

ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL. AND IF

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:29.925
THE ACT OF THE BRING US

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:30.993
ANYTHING IT'S ALWAYS MORE THE

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.795
SAME POLICE POLICING THEMSELVES

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:33.529
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SMART TO

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:34.763
HAVE THIS BOARD AND I'M GLAD TO

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:35.698
SEE THAT IS PRESERVED IN THIS

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:37.866
BILL- THAT IT HAS PEOPLE FROM

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:39.068
DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE AND SO

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:43.472
CALLED. SUPPORTED THANKS AND

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:44.607
REFERENCE THANK YOU. BRITISH

01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:47.810
ACTOR. THANK YOU. SO A COUPLE

01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:49.578
OF THINGS ON THE ISSUE IT'S OF

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:51.614
WHETHER WE NEED THIS OR NOT- WE

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.416
OBVIOUSLY DO I THINK THERE IS

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:57.786
NO- NO DIFFERENCES OF OPINION

01:10:57.853 --> 01:11:00.723
ON THAT- ONE OF THE REASONS WE

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:02.358
NEED THIS IS BECAUSE THE

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.659
CURRENT EMPLOYMENT LAWS THAT WE

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.728
HAVE CREATED- MAKE IT VERY

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:06.996
DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'RE HIRING

01:11:07.062 --> 01:11:09.565
SOMEBODY TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:10.799
THEIR PAST AND FIND OUT IF THEY

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.635
HAVE CHARACTER ISSUES. DIRECT

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:13.602
CONFLICT WITH THE

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:15.204
ORGANIZATIONAL VALUES THAT YOU

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:18.107
HAVE. AND IT YOU CAN ASK

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:19.908
CERTAIN QUESTIONS YOU CAN'T ASK

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:21.343
OTHER QUESTIONS FORMER

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.646
EMPLOYERS AREN'T ALLOWED TO

01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:25.981
GIVE BAD INFORMATION ABOUT TO

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.683
GIVE NEGATIVE INFORMATION.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.119
ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES-

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:32.621
OTHERWISE THEY CAN BE SUED. AND

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:34.556
THIS CREATES THIS ENVIRONMENT

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:37.259
WHERE- IT ONCE YOU'VE OFFLOADED

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:38.861
AN EMPLOYEE THAT YOU FEEL IS

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:40.863
GONE SOUTH. THEY'RE NOT YOUR

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:42.164
PROBLEM ANYMORE THEY BECOME

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:44.533
SOMEBODY ELSE'S. AND SO

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.168
ESPECIALLY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:48.237
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE.

01:11:48.303 --> 01:11:51.006
A MECHANISM TO IDENTIFY

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:52.941
SOMEBODY THAT CAN NO LONGER

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:55.144
UPHOLD THOSE VALUES. AND ON

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:57.312
THAT SUBJECT IF YOU GUYS WANT

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:59.815
TOLD ME JUST A LITTLE BIT- YOU

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:01.784
KNOW I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:04.119
WORKING. WITH PEOPLE FROM THE

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:06.388
BEGINNINGS OF THEIR CAREER IN

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:07.923
LAW ENFORCEMENT. ALL THE WAY TO

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.692
THE END AND THEN EVEN KNOWING

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:12.695
THEM PASS THAT. WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:14.430
THEY START OUT AND THEY'RE NOT

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:16.398
BAD APPLES IN THAT

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.367
CHARACTERIZATION KIND OF HURTS.

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:20.369
BECAUSE THEY AREN'T BAD APPLES.

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:22.571
BUT ALONG THE WAY DEPENDING

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:23.105
UPON THE ENVIRONMENT THAT

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.407
THEY'RE WORKING IN. THEY BECOME

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:28.010
TAINTED AND SOMETIMES BY THE

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:29.144
MIDDLE OF THEIR CAREERS YOU CAN

01:12:29.211 --> 01:12:30.913
TELL THAT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:32.614
PERSON THAT GOT HIRED WAY BACK

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:35.350
WHEN. THEY'VE SEEN THINGS THAT

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:38.220
WE SHOULDN'T SEE. OVER AND OVER

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:40.389
AND OVER AND THEY DON'T HAVE

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:43.225
THE LUXURY OF. LIKE WHEN I WENT

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:44.359
TO WORK FOR THE COUNTY WHERE I

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:45.894
WENT FROM ONE ENVIRONMENT TO AN

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:48.497
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ONE. TO HELP

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:50.899
REESTABLISH. THE GOOD THAT'S IN

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:55.003
THE WORLD. AND SO BY THE END OF

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.740
THEIR CAREERS YOU CAN TELL THAT

01:12:57.806 --> 01:13:00.409
THEY'RE BURNED OUT. AND SOME OF

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:02.244
THOSE CAREERS ENDED TWENTY

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:03.078
YEARS AND SOME OF THOSE CAREERS

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:04.713
GO TO THIRTY AND SOME PEOPLE

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.715
ACTUALLY MANAGED TO GET THROUGH

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:08.951
THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS. AND THERE

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:11.653
ARE TAINTED. AND NERVE THERE

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.588
YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:14.757
PSYCHOLOGICALLY DAMAGED. AND

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:18.894
THEY'VE GOT PTSD. AND YET. ONCE

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:20.662
THEY RETIRE A FEW YEARS LATER.

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:22.431
I I'VE RUN INTO PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:24.099
DOING GREAT ONE OF THEM IS THE

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.001
MAYOR OF THE CITY IN THE AREA

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:29.605
OUR CITY OF INGLEWOOD. SO YOU

01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:31.173
KNOW THAT DID TO MAKE IT SOUND

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.808
LIKE THESE GUYS GET ON BECAUSE

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:36.178
THEY DON'T- THE PROCESS DOESN'T

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.379
ALLOW THEM INITIALLY TO GET IN

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:41.583
THERE. THAT THEY'RE JUST BAD

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.118
APPLES WITH BAD INTENT FROM THE

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:45.087
START I THINK IT'S A BAD

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:47.022
CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT IS

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.691
GOING ON WITH THIS ISSUE. AND

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:52.261
ONE OTHER THING. A LOT OF TIMES

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:54.429
I'VE SEEN ALONG THE WAY. THAT

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:56.532
THE OFFICERS THAT YOU THAT

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:58.333
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEY

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.536
DON'T EVEN LIKE THEMSELVES. AND

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:01.603
THEY USUALLY FIX THAT

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:04.740
THEMSELVES. AND THOSE ARE THE

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:06.141
ONES THAT YOU DON'T READ ABOUT

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.509
THOSE IN THE PAPER YOU JUST

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:08.477
KNOW THEY DIED AND WERE HAVING

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:10.979
A FUNERAL AND IT'S USUALLY A

01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:11.547
QUIET ONE BECAUSE THEY KILL

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:14.349
THEMSELVES. SO THIS ISSUE IS A

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:18.353
BIG ISSUE. AND HOW WE HANDLE IT

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.722
IT IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:23.592
AND WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT.

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:26.061
NOW I AM HEARD FROM I'VE HEARD

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:27.462
FROM LABOR I'VE HEARD FROM

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:28.697
MANAGEMENT I'VE HEARD FROM THE

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.199
PUBLIC I'VE HEARD FROM MY

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:31.533
COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.803
AISLE. THEY ALL AGREED THAT WE

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:38.941
NEED TO HAVE A PROCESS. BUT WE

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:43.045
HAVE STAUNCH OPPOSITION TO THIS.

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:44.479
NOT JUST FROM OTHER OFFICERS

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:45.981
NOT JUST FROM THEM WE'RE

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:47.816
TALKING ABOUT CITY'S LEAGUE

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:49.952
BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:51.653
HOW SOME OF THE LANGUAGE CAN

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.923
CREATE. ISSUES THAT WILL WIND

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.325
UP IN COURT AND COSTING THE

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:58.560
TAXPAYERS MONEY. BECAUSE IT'S

01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:00.529
NOT THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO GET

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:01.129
STUDENTS TO TAXPAYERS WHO GET

01:15:01.196 --> 01:15:06.301
SUED. AND SO THIS IS SO CLOSE.

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:09.137
TO BEING THAT BILL. IT JUST

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:11.340
NEEDS SOME MORE TWEAKING AND

01:15:11.406 --> 01:15:15.777
THOSE TWO TWEAKS ARE. THE THAT

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:17.412
ONE THE ONE PART WHERE WE'RE

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:20.349
LIKE AXE DEMONSTRATING BIAS ON

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:22.117
RACE NATIONAL ORIGIN SEXUAL

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:24.386
THAT IS SO BROAD IT HAS TO BE

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:27.055
NARROWED DOWN IN ORDER TO GET.

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:29.324
SUPPORT FOR THAT. THE OTHER ONE

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:31.426
IS THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD AND

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:32.527
WHILE I AGREE WITH MY

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:36.031
COLLEAGUES. THAT THE MAKEUP OF

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:38.934
THE BOARD NEEDS TO HAVE PEOPLE.

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:41.203
FROM WITHOUT IN ORDER YOU KNOW

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:44.106
FROM OUTSIDE THE ORGANIZATION.

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:44.706
YOU CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:46.909
BIASED. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH A

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:49.444
JURY SELECTION. THAT JURY

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:52.047
SELECTION ISN'T IT YOU KNOW IF

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:53.448
YOU'RE IN A RAPE TRIAL THEY'RE

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:55.150
NOT GOING TO PUT SOMEBODY WHO

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:57.219
HAS BEEN GREAT ON THE TRIAL TO

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.954
DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEBODY

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:01.757
BECAUSE THAT BIAS. NOW BIAS

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:04.226
WILL TAKE THEIR OPINION ABOUT

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:05.327
THIS SITUATION THEY'RE DEALING

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.796
WITH. NOT NECESSARILY THE WHAT

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:08.664
HAS HAPPENED TO THEM IN THE

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.365
PAST WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO

01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:11.433
PEOPLE IN THE PAST IS

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.969
IMPORTANT. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

01:16:14.036 --> 01:16:14.903
THAT IN THE BOARD THAT WE MAKE

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:16.905
UP. THAT'S WHERE THE OPPOSITION

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:19.308
IS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:21.543
FIX BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ALTHOUGH

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.512
YOU SAID IT WAS PRIMARILY

01:16:23.578 --> 01:16:26.248
FORMED OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT'S

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:27.215
TWO TO NINE IN THOSE TO OUR

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:29.184
GOVERNOR APPOINTED. ONE OF THE

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:30.852
QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR YOU IS

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:31.853
ONCE THE GOVERNOR MAKES AN

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.156
APPOINTMENT. AND THEN SAY THE

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:35.724
GOVERNOR CHANGES DOES THE NEW

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:36.992
GOVERNOR COME IN AND CHANGE THE

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:38.427
BOARD ACCORDING THOSE

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:40.028
APPOINTMENTS DIZZY. HAVE THE

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:41.663
RIGHT TO DECOMMISSION PEOPLE

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:42.864
AND THEN APPOINT PEOPLE HE

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:45.133
WANTS WOMEN TO TERMINAL LEVEL

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.736
TERMS OF ONE. WOULD SURVIVE I'M

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:49.571
I'M HOPING THAT WE WOULD HONOR

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:50.706
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER COMMISSIONS

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:52.641
YOU HAVE A TERM IN WHICH YOU

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:55.077
SERVE. SERVICE DURING THAT TERM

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:57.245
IN THE END THAT GOVERNOR OR-

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:59.481
PERSON OR- GET THE SPEAKER THE

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.216
PROTEOME ALSO WANTED TERM

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.451
EXPIRES THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:03.852
APPOINT. THEIR OWN DESIGNATED

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:04.953
INDIVIDUAL TO SERVE ON THE

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.955
SPORTS BECAUSE THAT ALSO OPENS

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:09.791
IT UP TO OBVIOUSLY POLITICS.

01:17:09.858 --> 01:17:11.460
WHICH A LOT OF THINGS.

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:12.728
EVERYTHING ALLOWED I'M POLITICS

BILL. AND IF YOU'RE THOSE

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:23.105
THINGS CAN BE A TO. I WOULD BE.

WANTS THIS TO HAPPEN. WE NEED

01:17:31.947 --> 01:17:33.281
TO TAKE CARE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:35.650
ARE CAUSING IT NOT TO. SO THANK

OF ADVOCACY IN TRYING TO

ADDRESS THESE ARE DIFFICULT

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:46.228
ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE THAT

THERE ARE BAD APPLES. THERE ARE

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:46.541
BAD INDIVIDUALS. AND WHETHER

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:48.443
THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS WHETHER

THEIR TEACHERS WHETHER THEIR

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:51.079

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:52.681
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT TAINTED

BY THE PROCESS THEY'RE JUST BAD

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:56.985
INDIVIDUALS. AND WE SEE THAT

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:59.888
THE F. B. I.'S EVEN DID A-

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:01.623

GROUP IN THE STATE ARE IN THE

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.002
COUNTRY SO THE REALITY IS THAT.

01:21:14.069 --> 01:21:15.804
AND WE'RE NOT HERE TO TARNISH

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.138
LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE I SAID

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:18.907
I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:21.243
SERVED AS POLICE OFFICERS I

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:22.711

EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

DO IN THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE

01:21:34.789 --> 01:21:36.925
DONE. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:38.660
GIVEN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:39.961
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALWAYS GIVEN

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:41.563
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT SO TO

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:45.367
BE AFRAID OF SEVEN INDIVIDUALS.

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:46.768
BEFORE YOU FEEL THAT THEY WOULD

01:21:46.835 --> 01:21:49.070
BE ANYMORE BIAS THAN IF THIS.

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:52.340

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.109
COMPRISED OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I

01:21:54.175 --> 01:21:55.677
HAVE A NEIGHBOR WHEN A TOP

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:58.313
CRIMINAL TO. OF ATTORNEYS IN

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.015
THE COUNTY OF NOT IN THE STATE

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.750
WAS APPOINTED TO THE BENCH A

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:04.452
NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. AFTER TWO

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:05.053
YEARS SITTING ON THE BENCH HE

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.522
RESIGN. HE RESIGNED BECAUSE OF

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.424
THE INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.459
THAT EXISTED BETWEEN THE DA THE

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:13.261
INVESTIGATING AGENCIES AND THE

01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:15.930
JUDGES MOSTLY ALL JUDGES. ARE

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:18.466
FORMER DA'S AND MOST EVERYBODY

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:20.402
MY BEST TO GET FOR THE DA'S OR-

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:21.903
FORMER POLICE OFFICERS AND HE

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:23.972
SAYS TO GET AN INDICTMENT. ON A

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:27.042
POLICE OFFICER LET ALONE. A

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:27.509
CONVICTION IT'S ALMOST

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:29.978
IMPOSSIBLE. IT IS TWO YEARS ON

01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:33.682
THE BENCH NOT ONE OFFICER WAS

01:22:33.748 --> 01:22:35.617
EVER IN DIED. SO THIS PROCESS

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:38.420
IS NEEDED. THERE WERE THIRTEEN

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:39.020
HUNDRED POLICE SHOOTINGS OVER

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:41.222
THE LAST TWO YEARS. MOST

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:41.723
THIRTEEN HUNDRED POLICE

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.224
SHOOTINGS THIRTEEN OFFICERS

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:46.094
WERE CHARGE. OF THOSE THIRTEEN

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:48.830
ONE WAS CONVICTED. YOU TELL ME

01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:52.600
THAT'S NOT A BIASED STACKED. A

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:55.437
REVIEW OF BY SOMEONE. COME ON

01:22:55.503 --> 01:22:57.038
WE WOULD GO TO VEGAS IN A HEART

01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:59.274
BEAT WE HAVE THOSE KIND OFF.

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:01.876
THE ISSUE IS BEFORE US FOLKS

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:04.679
IT'S CLEAR WE'VE DONE POLICING

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:05.814
FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.882
THE SAME WAY. AND WE KEEP

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:09.317
GETTING THE SAME RESULTS

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:12.854
NOTHING. THIS IS A FAIR PROCESS

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.122
IT'S A PROCESS IT'S LONG

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:17.425
OVERDUE IT'S TIME HAS COME. AND

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:19.761
WE MUST TRUST THE SAME PEOPLE

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.863
WHO TRUST US TO COME HERE TO

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:23.698
SACRAMENTO AND MAKE DECISIONS

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:26.000
ON ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:28.103
THE BE UNBIASED AND BE FAIR WHY

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.671
CAN'T WE GIVE THE BENEFIT OF

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:30.705
THE DOUBT OF THOSE SAME

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.374
CIVILIAN PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.209
APPOINTED TO THIS BOARD. TO BE

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:36.311
UNBIASED AND FAIR FOR THE

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:39.914
SECTOR BIASES ASIDE WERE ASKED

01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:40.515
TO DO THAT EVERY DAY BUT SOME

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:42.117

I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE OPEN TO

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:51.159
DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. I'VE

01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:53.094
LISTENED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:55.230
AND THE ONLY SUGGESTION I HAVE

01:23:55.296 --> 01:23:55.730
IS NOT THIS BILL MISTER

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:58.433

JUST TO SAY I GOT A WIN AND IT

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.016
SOUTH IT DOES ABSOLUTELY

SO WE GOT A VICTORY WE GOT IT

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:20.855

THE BILL AND SAY THAT RIGHT

02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:40.525
AWAY- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:11:40.592 --> 02:11:42.494
KEEPS BEING BROUGHT UP IS BLACK

02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:45.564
AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. AND IT

02:11:45.631 --> 02:11:47.499
JUST BARELY AFFECTED BROCKTON

02:11:47.566 --> 02:11:50.369
BROWN COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW

02:11:50.435 --> 02:11:51.503
I HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING A

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:53.405
BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY FOR A

02:11:53.472 --> 02:11:55.641
LONG MANY MANY MANY YEARS. AND

02:11:55.707 --> 02:11:57.142
THE FAMILIES THAT LIVE IN BLACK

02:11:57.209 --> 02:11:58.877
AND BROWN COMMUNITIES DON'T

02:11:58.944 --> 02:12:00.812
WANT CRIME THEY DON'T WANT

02:12:00.879 --> 02:12:02.914
THEIR KIDS EXPOSED TO CRIME

02:12:02.981 --> 02:12:04.750
THEY DON'T WANT THEIR- KIDS

02:12:04.816 --> 02:12:06.318
EXPOSED TO THE NEGATIVE

02:12:06.385 --> 02:12:07.919
ELEMENTS THEY JUST WANT TO LIVE

02:12:07.986 --> 02:12:10.589
THEIR LIVES JUST LIKE EVERYONE

02:12:10.656 --> 02:12:11.056
ELSE DOES IN ANY OTHER

02:12:11.123 --> 02:12:13.592
COMMUNITY. AND YET WE'RE MAKING

02:12:13.659 --> 02:12:16.428
EXCUSES WHY IT'S OKAY FOR THEM

02:12:16.495 --> 02:12:18.130
TO HAVE TO TELL THEIR KID HEY

02:12:18.196 --> 02:12:19.498
WHEN YOU WALK TO SCHOOL OR COME

02:12:19.564 --> 02:12:21.233
HOME FROM SCHOOL. YOU NEED TO

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:23.368
TAKE THE SECURED AS ROUTE TO

02:12:23.435 --> 02:12:24.636
GET HOME BECAUSE OTHERWISE

02:12:24.703 --> 02:12:25.671
YOU'RE GOING TO GO BY THE

02:12:25.737 --> 02:12:28.840
CORNER. THAT HAS FOLKS THAT ARE

02:12:28.907 --> 02:12:31.376
ENGAGE IN SEX WORK TRAFFIC AND

02:12:31.443 --> 02:12:33.111
A LOT OF TIMES THOSE FOLKS ARE

02:12:33.178 --> 02:12:35.347
ALSO HAVE DRUG PROBLEMS- AND

02:12:35.414 --> 02:12:36.481
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO TO SUPPORT

02:12:36.548 --> 02:12:38.717
THEIR DRUG HABITS. AND SO THEY

02:12:38.784 --> 02:12:40.352
HAVE. YOU KNOW SHIFTY

02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:43.555
CHARACTERS BETTER HANG AROUND.

02:12:43.622 --> 02:12:45.824
AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TYPE

02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:47.859
OF BILLS THAT IS ACTUALLY

02:12:47.926 --> 02:12:50.062
TAKING A TOOL AWAY. FROM PEOPLE

02:12:50.128 --> 02:12:51.430
THAT ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO

02:12:51.496 --> 02:12:53.498
HELP THESE FOLKS. THEY'RE

02:12:53.565 --> 02:12:54.266
TRYING TO GIVE THEM THAT

02:12:54.333 --> 02:12:57.235
OUTLET. AND ARE DIFFERENT TO BE

02:12:57.302 --> 02:13:00.505
ABLE TO BE- ARE ARRESTED. AND

02:13:00.572 --> 02:13:02.307
THEN GIVEN THE CHOICE OF DO

02:13:02.374 --> 02:13:03.775
THEY WANT HELP AND THEY DON'T

02:13:03.842 --> 02:13:07.879
SPEND MUCH TIME IN IN JAIL THEY

02:13:07.946 --> 02:13:08.613
USUALLY GET CITED AND RELEASED.

02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:11.950
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HELPS.

02:13:12.017 --> 02:13:13.985
THOSE FOLKS THAT LIVE IN BLACK

02:13:14.052 --> 02:13:16.321
AND BROWN COMMUNITIES I DON'T

02:13:16.388 --> 02:13:18.557
KNOW HOW THIS HELPS FOLKS THAT

02:13:18.623 --> 02:13:20.492
DON'T WANT TO BE HUMAN YOU KNOW

02:13:20.559 --> 02:13:22.494
HUMAN A PART OF THE HUMAN

02:13:22.561 --> 02:13:23.095
TRAFFICKING RINGS THAT ARE OUT

02:13:23.161 --> 02:13:27.232
THERE- I DON'T THINK REMOVING

02:13:27.299 --> 02:13:29.434
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS IS

02:13:29.501 --> 02:13:30.135
GOING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM FOR

02:13:30.202 --> 02:13:32.270
THOSE COMMUNITIES. I THINK WE

02:13:32.337 --> 02:13:35.807
NEED TO HAVE MORE MORE ACTIVITY

02:13:35.874 --> 02:13:37.676
TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE FOLKS.

02:13:37.743 --> 02:13:40.545
THAT ARE BEING THERE ARE BEING

02:13:40.612 --> 02:13:42.147
HUMAN TRAFFICKED. AND THIS

02:13:42.214 --> 02:13:45.450
ISN'T IT. THIS IS GOING EXACTLY

02:13:45.517 --> 02:13:46.818
OPPOSITE DIRECTION THIS MAKING

02:13:46.885 --> 02:13:49.287
COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE IT'S

02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:52.290
EXPOSING KEEP FAMILIES THAT ARE

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:54.559
GOOD LAW ABIDING FAMILIES.

02:13:54.626 --> 02:13:57.129
THIRD TO MORE OF THIS STUFF

02:13:57.195 --> 02:13:57.729
THAT THEY DON'T WANT IN THEIR

02:13:57.796 --> 02:14:00.699
COMMUNITIES. SO YEAH I HAVE TO

02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:06.438
OPPOSE IT- AND YOU KNOW I'VE I

02:14:06.505 --> 02:14:07.072
FOLKS BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:14:07.139 --> 02:14:11.109
HELP THEM. THANK YOU. FOR YOUR-

02:14:11.176 --> 02:14:15.614
INPUT MISTER POWER K. THANK YOU

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:19.117
MR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO I

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:21.620
THINK THAT YOU KNOW I'M TERRY

02:14:21.686 --> 02:14:22.921
BILLS TO SUPPORT VICTIMS OF

02:14:22.988 --> 02:14:24.022
HUMAN TRAFFICKING I THINK HUMAN

02:14:24.089 --> 02:14:26.258
TRAFFICKING IS. ONE OF THE

02:14:26.324 --> 02:14:27.926
THINGS THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE

02:14:27.993 --> 02:14:30.462
SHOULD CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON

02:14:30.529 --> 02:14:31.630
WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT I

02:14:31.696 --> 02:14:33.365
SPEAKS AT THE DAYS THAT I HAVE

02:14:33.432 --> 02:14:34.366
A PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH AND

02:14:34.433 --> 02:14:35.634
THEY SAY THAT THE PROBLEM JUST

02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:37.936
CONTINUES TO EXACERBATE AND

02:14:38.003 --> 02:14:38.737
WHAT WE'RE DOING ISN'T WORKING

02:14:38.804 --> 02:14:40.572
AND SO. I THINK THAT'S REALLY

02:14:40.639 --> 02:14:43.141
IMPORTANT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:14:43.208 --> 02:14:44.943
HOWEVER HOW CRIMINALIZING THE

02:14:45.010 --> 02:14:46.178
VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING

02:14:46.244 --> 02:14:47.512
WHICH IS WHAT THIS LAW

02:14:47.579 --> 02:14:49.381
CURRENTLY DOES IT IS NOT A

02:14:49.448 --> 02:14:50.615
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS WHO ARE

02:14:50.682 --> 02:14:52.284
LOITERING IT IS THE VICTIMS OF

02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:53.185
HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAT ARE

02:14:53.251 --> 02:14:55.353
LOITERING HELPS THOSE VICTIMS

02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:56.955
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO FIND

02:14:57.022 --> 02:14:58.557
REAL WAYS TO HELP THOSE VICTIMS

02:14:58.623 --> 02:15:01.259
RATHER THAN CRIMINALIZING THEM.

02:15:01.326 --> 02:15:01.860
ENSURING THEY GET THE SUPPORT

02:15:01.927 --> 02:15:04.095
THEY NEED. AND I WANT TO BE

02:15:04.162 --> 02:15:05.130
REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS

02:15:05.197 --> 02:15:06.865
BILL DOES NOT DO. THIS BILL

02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:08.433
DOES NOT LEGALIZE PROSTITUTION

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:09.801
THE AFTER PROSTITUTION ITSELF

02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:11.503
WILL STILL BE A CRIME. IT IS

02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:14.039
MERELY THE PRECURSOR LOITERING

02:15:14.105 --> 02:15:14.606
THAT IS BEING DEALT WITH IN

02:15:14.673 --> 02:15:17.843
THIS LEGISLATION. AND SO AGAIN

02:15:17.909 --> 02:15:19.711
IF SOMEBODY ACTUALLY.

02:15:19.778 --> 02:15:20.812
COMMITTING THE ACTS OF

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:22.247
PROSTITUTION THAT MADE OUT WITH

02:15:22.314 --> 02:15:24.649
UNDER THE RELEVANT SECTIONS-

02:15:24.716 --> 02:15:25.984
EVEN AFTER THIS BILL. IS

02:15:26.051 --> 02:15:27.819
ENACTED INTO LAW IF IT SO DOES

02:15:27.886 --> 02:15:29.754
SO I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW. I

02:15:29.821 --> 02:15:31.156
APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S

02:15:31.223 --> 02:15:32.190
POINTS BUT I THINK THAT THERE

02:15:32.257 --> 02:15:33.358
ARE BETTER WAYS TO HELP VICTIMS

02:15:33.425 --> 02:15:35.393
THAN CRIMINALIZING THAT I PUSH

02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:36.761
IT THIS AND I. WILL MOVE THE

02:15:36.828 --> 02:15:37.729
BILL IF IT IS NOT ALREADY BEEN

02:15:37.796 --> 02:15:41.466
MOVED. OKAY ANY MORE COMMENTS

02:15:41.533 --> 02:15:42.934

02:15:44.736 --> 02:15:47.539

THE BLACK AMERICAN DOES NOT

02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:20.272
LIKE TO BE SUBJECT TO

04:28:39.203 --> 04:28:40.471
WE FELT IF THE CHIEF JUSTICE IN

SOMETHING THAT WAS

04:28:44.575 --> 04:28:46.143
CONSTITUTIONAL WE'RE PROBABLY A

04:28:46.210 --> 04:28:48.412
PRETTY SOLID GROUND. WHAT THEY

04:28:48.479 --> 04:28:50.681
DIDN'T QUITE AMAZING TO ME

04:28:50.747 --> 04:28:51.482
WHICH I REALLY WAS QUITE

04:28:51.548 --> 04:28:54.251
SURPRISED BY. IS THEY CAME UP

04:28:54.318 --> 04:28:54.852
WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY

04:28:54.918 --> 04:28:58.589
THAT SAYS. NO BAIL YOU COULD

04:28:58.655 --> 04:28:59.556
HAVE AN APPROPRIATE PRE TRIAL

04:28:59.623 --> 04:29:01.024
DETENTION SYSTEM THE TO HAS

04:29:01.091 --> 04:29:02.659
BASICALLY ELIMINATES BAIL AS

04:29:02.726 --> 04:29:04.228
LONG AS YOU HAD A SYSTEMIC

04:29:04.294 --> 04:29:05.829
PROCESS IN PLACE THAT'S A

04:29:05.896 --> 04:29:07.831
SYSTEMIC PROCESS WAS THE FORM

04:29:07.898 --> 04:29:10.367
THE FOUNDATION OF S. B. TEN HAD

04:29:10.434 --> 04:29:11.802
TO DO WITH THESE ASSESSMENT

04:29:11.869 --> 04:29:14.671
TOOLS THESE ALGORITHMS FORTY

04:29:14.738 --> 04:29:15.172
SEVEN COUNTIES CURRENTLY

04:29:15.239 --> 04:29:16.740
CONTINUE TO USE THEM BUT THIS

04:29:16.807 --> 04:29:18.509
IDEA WAS THESE ALGORITHMS THAT

04:29:18.575 --> 04:29:20.244
WE'RE GOING TO DETERMINE

04:29:20.310 --> 04:29:21.712
WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY. WOULD

04:29:21.778 --> 04:29:22.946
APPEAR WHETHER THEY WERE FOR

04:29:23.013 --> 04:29:24.481
THE REST OF THOSE ALGORITHMS

04:29:24.548 --> 04:29:25.949
PROVED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT

04:29:26.016 --> 04:29:28.051
CHALLENGES. FOR COMMUNITIES TO

04:29:28.118 --> 04:29:29.953
OVER POLICED AND OFTEN WERE

04:29:30.020 --> 04:29:31.955
CRITICIZED IN THE LATER YEARS

04:29:32.022 --> 04:29:33.557
NOT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN.

04:29:33.624 --> 04:29:34.825
WHERE THEY WERE SUPPORTED BUT

04:29:34.892 --> 04:29:36.226
WERE ULTIMATELY CRITICIZES

04:29:36.293 --> 04:29:38.362
TOOLS OF PREJUDICE AND- DIDN'T

04:29:38.428 --> 04:29:39.897
REALLY GET TO THE ISSUE OF

04:29:39.963 --> 04:29:42.232
JUSTICE. AND SO WHEN THIS

04:29:42.299 --> 04:29:44.968
MEASURE WAS PASSED AND SB

04:29:45.035 --> 04:29:46.703
TELLING THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT.

04:29:46.770 --> 04:29:47.838
IN BOTH HOUSES THE BAIL

04:29:47.905 --> 04:29:49.706
INDUSTRY SPENT MILLIONS OF

04:29:49.773 --> 04:29:50.374
DOLLARS TO REFERENDA THE

04:29:50.440 --> 04:29:52.509
MEASURE. BUT THE REFERENDUM

04:29:52.576 --> 04:29:54.011
WASN'T BASED UPON THE ARGUMENTS

THAT WAS CRITICAL TO WHO WE ARE

04:31:51.695 --> 04:31:53.697
AS A PEOPLE. THIS COURT DID THE

04:31:53.764 --> 04:31:55.365

NOT INCOMPLETE WOULDN'T TOUCH

04:32:01.338 --> 04:32:03.140
EVERYTHING THEY DID BUT THE

04:32:03.206 --> 04:32:04.074
CORE ISSUE OF THE ABILITY TO

04:32:04.141 --> 04:32:05.976
PAY. AND WE SET FORTH A

04:32:06.043 --> 04:32:08.078
BLUEPRINT NOW HOW DO WE MAKE

04:32:08.145 --> 04:32:10.013
THAT BLUEPRINT. WE DIDN'T WANT

04:32:10.080 --> 04:32:10.947
TO GET OUT THERE AND DO

04:32:11.014 --> 04:32:12.916
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE COMING UP

04:32:12.983 --> 04:32:14.918
WITH A BUNCH OF CRAZY IDEAS. WE

04:32:14.985 --> 04:32:15.886
DID THE SAME THING WE DID

04:32:15.952 --> 04:32:18.021
BEFORE WE COPY THE JUDICIAL

04:32:18.088 --> 04:32:19.823

GOVERNMENT. WE TOOK THE IDEA

04:32:30.634 --> 04:32:32.869
THAT THEY USE ZERO BAIL. DURING

04:32:32.936 --> 04:32:36.807
THE- PANDEMIC. AND WE JUST USE

04:32:36.873 --> 04:32:39.643
THEIR SAME STANDARDS THE ONLY

04:32:39.710 --> 04:32:40.577
THING WITH A DIFFERENT. AFTER

04:32:40.644 --> 04:32:41.378
DISCUSSING THIS WITH A FEW

04:32:41.445 --> 04:32:43.714
FOLKS WE CHANGE SOME OF THE

04:32:43.780 --> 04:32:45.382
EXCLUSIONS THAT THEY HAD IN THE

04:32:45.449 --> 04:32:47.317
VERY DOT LAW THAT WE CREATED

04:32:47.384 --> 04:32:48.752
BECAUSE WE GET. DIDN'T WANT TO

04:32:48.819 --> 04:32:49.953

EVERYBODY BEAT US UP AND SAY

04:32:53.657 --> 04:32:55.025
HERTZBERG YOUR INVENTION THAT

04:32:55.092 --> 04:32:56.626
THIS WORLD IT DOESN'T WORK WE

04:32:56.693 --> 04:32:57.427
WANT TO SHOW SOMETHING THAT

04:32:57.494 --> 04:32:59.129
WORKED. WE ADDED A FEW

04:32:59.196 --> 04:33:01.098
PROVISIONS WE SAID. AND IT'S

04:33:01.164 --> 04:33:01.832
INTERESTING BECAUSE THE

04:33:01.898 --> 04:33:03.600
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OPPOSITION

04:33:03.667 --> 04:33:06.136
TALKS ABOUT THESE THINGS WHICH

04:33:06.203 --> 04:33:07.537
WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN OUT SO. IT

04:33:07.604 --> 04:33:09.673
A WEATHER UPDATE WE SAID THE

04:33:09.740 --> 04:33:10.240
VIOLATION OF A HATE CRIME IS

04:33:10.307 --> 04:33:11.641
EXCLUDED. WE SAID HUMAN

04:33:11.708 --> 04:33:12.943
TRAFFICKERS EXCLUDED ELDER

04:33:13.009 --> 04:33:15.879
ABUSE CHILD ABUSE ASSAULTS.

04:33:15.946 --> 04:33:17.047
WITH THE FORCE SHOULD LIKELY

04:33:17.114 --> 04:33:19.583
BECAUSE OF BODILY INJURY AND

04:33:19.649 --> 04:33:21.618
ALSO THE DA'S TALKED ABOUT

04:33:21.685 --> 04:33:22.753
ANOTHER ISSUE THEY COMPLAINED

04:33:22.819 --> 04:33:23.954
ABOUT THAT WE HAD OUT IN THE

04:33:24.020 --> 04:33:28.825
EARLY VERSION. WHICH WAS- KAREN

04:33:28.892 --> 04:33:30.927
WITH IT WAS- THAT WAS ANOTHER

04:33:30.994 --> 04:33:33.063
ISSUE I THINK- WITNESS

04:33:33.130 --> 04:33:34.464
INTIMIDATION THAT WAS IT WAS

04:33:34.531 --> 04:33:35.799
ALREADY OUT SO WE DEALT WITH

04:33:35.866 --> 04:33:38.168
THAT SECONDLY SOME OTHER FOLKS

04:33:38.235 --> 04:33:38.802
TALKED ABOUT AND WE THOUGHT IT

04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:42.072
WAS APPROPRIATE. TO MODIFY WHAT

04:33:42.139 --> 04:33:44.474
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DID. WAS

04:33:44.541 --> 04:33:45.075
THIS WHOLE IDEA THE REVOLVING

04:33:45.142 --> 04:33:47.711
DOOR. WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CASE

04:33:47.778 --> 04:33:49.112
WHERE SOMEBODY HAS A SMALL

04:33:49.179 --> 04:33:52.449
PETTY CRIME. THEY GET ARRESTED

04:33:52.516 --> 04:33:54.284
THEY GET RELEASED AND A WEEK

04:33:54.351 --> 04:33:56.253
LATER THEY DO IT AGAIN. DO YOU

04:33:56.319 --> 04:33:59.222
JUST LET HIM GO. SO WE PUT IN A

04:33:59.289 --> 04:34:01.091
PROVISION IN THE MODIFICATIONS

04:34:01.158 --> 04:34:02.092
THAT'S THE SECOND THING WE DO

04:34:02.159 --> 04:34:03.460
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

04:34:03.527 --> 04:34:05.028
BONTA HAD BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE.

04:34:05.095 --> 04:34:09.432
THAT SAID- NO REVOLVING DOOR IF

04:34:09.499 --> 04:34:11.535
YOU HAVE A FIRST TIME OUT

04:34:11.601 --> 04:34:13.236
YOU'RE YOU'RE OUT THERE AND YOU

04:34:13.303 --> 04:34:14.871
YOU GET RELEASED A SECOND TIME

04:34:14.938 --> 04:34:16.039
YOU GOTTA GO TO THE PROCESS THE

04:34:16.106 --> 04:34:18.041
PROCESS IS COURT LOOKS AT YOUR

04:34:18.108 --> 04:34:19.576
ABILITY TO PAY IS A LEAST

04:34:19.643 --> 04:34:21.077
RESTRICTIVE FACTOR AND THE

04:34:21.144 --> 04:34:22.712
FACTORS THAT WERE SET FORTH. IN

04:34:22.779 --> 04:34:26.950
THE COURT- SO LOOK YOU KNOW.

04:34:27.017 --> 04:34:29.820
WE'RE TRYING. THE OTHER

04:34:29.886 --> 04:34:31.021
ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE I THINK

04:34:31.087 --> 04:34:32.255
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE

04:34:32.322 --> 04:34:33.490
ASSEMBLY VERSUS DUKE MAGING

04:34:33.557 --> 04:34:36.259
CASE THAT SET STANDARDS AS TO

04:34:36.326 --> 04:34:38.061
WHAT THE RULES SHOULD BE

04:34:38.128 --> 04:34:39.062
BETWEEN WHEN SOMETHING IS

04:34:39.129 --> 04:34:40.831
REFERENDUM AND WHETHER OR NOT

04:34:40.897 --> 04:34:41.898
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISCUSS

04:34:41.965 --> 04:34:43.366
IT AGAIN YOU CAN'T DO THE EXACT

04:34:43.433 --> 04:34:45.869
SAME THING WE'RE NOT DOING THE

04:34:45.936 --> 04:34:47.737
EXACT SAME THING THE LAST BILL

04:34:47.804 --> 04:34:49.339
ELIMINATED BAIL AND SET UP A

04:34:49.406 --> 04:34:50.807
STANDARD OF ALGORITHMS TO DO

04:34:50.874 --> 04:34:53.009
THE STANDARD THIS. ALLOWS FOR

04:34:53.076 --> 04:34:55.378
BAIL IT CREATES A STATE WIDE

04:34:55.445 --> 04:34:56.513
STANDARD WHY DO WE HAVE

04:34:56.580 --> 04:34:58.014
STATEWIDE STANDARDS BECAUSE IF

04:34:58.081 --> 04:34:59.216
YOU GET BUSTED IN NORTHERN

04:34:59.282 --> 04:35:01.017
CALIFORNIA THINK IT'S IN THE

04:35:01.084 --> 04:35:02.886
HUMBOLDT COUNTY FOR A CRIME YOU

04:35:02.953 --> 04:35:04.888
GET BUSTED IN SAN DIEGO IT'S

04:35:04.955 --> 04:35:06.089
FIVE TIMES BIGGER IN SAN DIEGO

04:35:06.156 --> 04:35:07.424
FOR THE SAME CRIME THAT

04:35:07.490 --> 04:35:08.959
SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE THOSE

04:35:09.025 --> 04:35:10.393
STANDARDS SHOULD BE SET BY THE

04:35:10.460 --> 04:35:11.361
JUDICIAL COUNCIL ACROSS THE

04:35:11.428 --> 04:35:13.196
STATE IN FACT. WHAT YOU'LL FIND

04:35:13.263 --> 04:35:14.731
IN THE OPPOSITION LETTER WHICH

04:35:14.798 --> 04:35:16.299
IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU FOUND

04:35:16.366 --> 04:35:17.133
IN THIS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE

04:35:17.200 --> 04:35:19.069
BEFORE WAS A BILL MYSTERIES

04:35:19.135 --> 04:35:20.537
ARGUING WELL LOCAL JURISDICTION

04:35:20.604 --> 04:35:22.539
LOCAL HAVE CONTROL ASSEMBLY-

04:35:22.606 --> 04:35:25.842
COOPER HAD A BILL OF STATEWIDE-

04:35:25.909 --> 04:35:27.644
MEASURE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO

04:35:27.711 --> 04:35:29.713
BUY THESE WROTE. WHAT I FOUND

04:35:29.779 --> 04:35:32.382
IN THIS FIVE SIX YEAR ENDEAVOR

04:35:32.449 --> 04:35:34.251
IS THAT AND I SEE THIS WE'LL

04:35:34.317 --> 04:35:35.785
SEE THIS IN OUR LIVES WE SEE

04:35:35.852 --> 04:35:37.320
THIS IN OUR BILLS BEFORE THIS

04:35:37.387 --> 04:35:39.189
THIS LEGISLATURE IS WHEN

04:35:39.256 --> 04:35:40.056
SOMEBODY WANTS TO OPPOSE

04:35:40.123 --> 04:35:41.725
SOMETHING THEY'LL THROW

04:35:41.791 --> 04:35:42.492
ANYTHING ON THE WALL AND SEE

04:35:42.559 --> 04:35:44.828
WHAT STICKS WITH THE COPS WE'RE

04:35:44.895 --> 04:35:46.496
SAVING MONEY WE'RE THIS WE'RE

04:35:46.563 --> 04:35:47.931
THAT IT'S UNFAIR IT'S THIS IT'S

04:35:47.998 --> 04:35:49.933
WHATEVER THE REALITY IS THE

04:35:50.000 --> 04:35:52.502
CURRENT SYSTEM IS UNBELIEVABLY

04:35:52.569 --> 04:35:54.371
UNFAIR TO FOLKS IT DOESN'T WORK

04:35:54.437 --> 04:35:56.239
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE

04:35:56.306 --> 04:35:57.140
CAN GO THROUGH KENTUCKY WE GO

04:35:57.207 --> 04:35:58.608
THROUGH THE JERSEY. WE GO TO

04:35:58.675 --> 04:36:00.210
NEW YORK WE CAN GO TO A NUMBER

04:36:00.277 --> 04:36:01.912
OF OTHER STATES OTHERS COUNTIES

04:36:01.978 --> 04:36:04.080
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE

04:36:04.147 --> 04:36:09.085
HAS BEEN THESE ALTERNATIVES. TO

04:36:09.152 --> 04:36:09.653
THE WORKED REASONABLY WELL.

04:36:09.719 --> 04:36:10.387
WHAT WE LOOK TO. THE PEOPLE CAN

04:36:10.453 --> 04:36:12.322

THEY- NEED THEY SHOW UP IN

04:36:13.990 --> 04:36:14.991
COURT BECAUSE THAT'S THE

04:36:15.058 --> 04:36:15.892
PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

04:36:15.959 --> 04:36:18.361
DO AND THEY DO. YOU DON'T HAVE

04:36:18.428 --> 04:36:20.263
TO TEAR SOMEONE'S LIFE APART

04:36:20.330 --> 04:36:22.232
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUIN THEIR

ABOUT IT. JUST BECAUSE- BECAUSE

05:04:30.018 --> 05:04:31.119
WHAT HAPPENS IS IF I ONLY COULD

05:04:31.186 --> 05:04:32.520
AFFORD THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

05:04:32.587 --> 05:04:33.722
AND THAT'S WHAT THE COURT'S

05:04:33.788 --> 05:04:35.557
GOING TO CHARGE FOR BAIL. AND

05:04:35.624 --> 05:04:37.225
THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR THE

05:04:37.292 --> 05:04:39.361
BILL COMPANIES TO ENGAGE THE

05:04:39.427 --> 05:04:39.961
REASON THE BILL COMPANIES ARE

05:04:40.028 --> 05:04:41.830
STILL ENGAGING. DURING THE

05:04:41.896 --> 05:04:43.331
PANDEMIC IS THEY REALLY WERE

05:04:43.398 --> 05:04:44.599
GOING AFTER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

05:04:44.666 --> 05:04:46.835
CASES. WE HAVE A REPORT HERE

05:04:46.901 --> 05:04:48.069
THAT SHOWS THAT THEY MADE A TON

05:04:48.136 --> 05:04:50.038
OF MONEY. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED

05:04:50.105 --> 05:04:51.239
A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES THEY

05:04:51.306 --> 05:04:52.340
WERE ABLE TO GET CHARGE PEOPLE

05:04:52.407 --> 05:04:53.608
OUT OF MONEY WHEN THEY WERE.

05:04:53.675 --> 05:04:54.209
GETTING IN FIGHTS WITH THEIR

05:04:54.275 --> 05:04:56.811
SPOUSES. GET OUT OF JAIL. AND

05:04:56.878 --> 05:04:58.513
MAKE MONEY ON THE FRONT END.

05:04:58.580 --> 05:04:59.848
AND SO THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE

05:04:59.914 --> 05:05:00.882
ABLE TO DO IT BUT SO I WOULD

05:05:00.949 --> 05:05:02.484
SUGGEST THAT. IT WOULDN'T BE AN

05:05:02.550 --> 05:05:04.152
UNDERSTATEMENT BY ME TO SAY

05:05:04.219 --> 05:05:05.353
THIS WOULD DRAMATICALLY IMPACT

05:05:05.420 --> 05:05:06.588
THE BUSINESS. BUT I WOULD

05:05:06.655 --> 05:05:07.389
SUGGEST IS GOING TO BE

05:05:07.455 --> 05:05:08.857
DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED JUST BY

05:05:08.923 --> 05:05:10.091
HUMPHRIES THAT SAYS ABILITY TO

05:05:10.158 --> 05:05:12.661
PAY. RIGHT SO YOU BAIL BONDS

05:05:12.727 --> 05:05:13.995
ARE ALL ABOUT. LEVERAGING

05:05:14.062 --> 05:05:15.463
SOMEBODY. GOING TO THEIR

05:05:15.530 --> 05:05:16.831
GRANDMOTHER TO THEIR SISTER TO

05:05:16.898 --> 05:05:18.299
THEIR- MOTHER TO ANYBODY TO

05:05:18.366 --> 05:05:20.301
GET. BORROW MONEY. TO THAT HAVE

05:05:20.368 --> 05:05:22.070
ENOUGH CASH TO PAY THE BAIL.

05:05:23.805 --> 05:05:25.674
THING IT'S REALLY. NICE AND

05:05:25.740 --> 05:05:27.375
THAT IS THE RATE OF THE IDEAS

05:05:27.442 --> 05:05:29.444
ONE. STOP DALE. WHAT IS THE

05:05:29.511 --> 05:05:32.013
PURPOSE OF BAIL. APOLOGIZE AND-

05:05:32.080 --> 05:05:34.015

LAST PART WHERE YOU SAID.

ABLE TO PAY THEIR OWN BAIL AND

05:06:06.815 --> 05:06:07.849

HERTZBERG FOR YOUR- PASSIONATE

05:06:20.862 --> 05:06:22.564
PRESENTATION DAY I THINK WE CAN

05:06:22.630 --> 05:06:23.932
ALL SEE HOW MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT

05:06:23.998 --> 05:06:25.333
THIS ISSUE AND CLEARLY WORKED

05:06:25.400 --> 05:06:28.103
ON FOR MANY YEARS. AND SO I

05:06:28.169 --> 05:06:29.370
WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT

05:06:29.437 --> 05:06:30.205
THERE'S MANY PARTS OF THIS BILL

05:06:30.271 --> 05:06:32.507
THAT I. I REALLY APPRECIATE AND

05:06:32.574 --> 05:06:34.209
ONE IS ACTUALLY SECTION FOR.

05:06:34.275 --> 05:06:36.177
WHICH ADDRESSES EXACTLY WHAT.

05:06:36.244 --> 05:06:37.846
WE JUST HAD A LONG CONVERSATION

05:06:37.912 --> 05:06:39.914
WITH WHICH IS THAT IF YOU ARE.

05:06:39.981 --> 05:06:41.583
IF AN ACTION IS DISMISSED OR

05:06:41.649 --> 05:06:43.184
YOU WERE NEVER CHARGE THE YOU

05:06:43.251 --> 05:06:45.019
DO NOT OWE MONEY I MEAN MAKING

05:06:45.086 --> 05:06:47.388
MONEY OFF AS WE KNOW. PEOPLE OF

05:06:47.455 --> 05:06:50.024
COLOR ARE RESTED IN FAR HIGHER

05:06:50.091 --> 05:06:51.993
NUMBERS. AND THEN IF THEY'RE

05:06:52.060 --> 05:06:53.995
NOT CHARGER CASE THERE'S MISS

05:06:54.062 --> 05:06:54.529
THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY IS

05:06:54.596 --> 05:06:58.933
PROFITING. OF THOSE ARRESTS IS.

05:06:59.000 --> 05:07:00.034
I MEAN I'M JUST WOULD BE AN

05:07:00.101 --> 05:07:01.736
UNDERSTATEMENT SO I THINK THAT

05:07:01.803 --> 05:07:02.604
THAT PIECE OF THIS BILL IS

05:07:02.670 --> 05:07:04.105
ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO GETTING IT

05:07:04.172 --> 05:07:06.074
THE ISSUE WE HAVE. WITH FAILING

05:07:06.141 --> 05:07:09.677
CALIFORNIA. I ALSO AM A HUGE.

05:07:09.744 --> 05:07:11.146
SUPPORTER OF GETTING RID OF

05:07:11.212 --> 05:07:12.781
MONEY BAIL I THINK THAT THE

05:07:12.847 --> 05:07:14.182
FACT THAT OUR SYSTEM CURRENTLY

05:07:14.249 --> 05:07:15.750
INCARCERATE THOSE WHO ARE

05:07:15.817 --> 05:07:17.552
IMPOVERISHED MORE THAN THOSE

05:07:17.619 --> 05:07:19.087
WHO ARE ARRESTED SOCIETY IS

05:07:19.154 --> 05:07:20.622
ALSO UPSIDE DOWN RIGHT WHAT WE

05:07:20.688 --> 05:07:22.390
SHOULD BE. HOLDING THOSE WHO

05:07:22.457 --> 05:07:24.159
POSE A SAFETY RISK NOT THOSE

05:07:24.225 --> 05:07:26.161
WHO CAN'T PAY. AND I APPRECIATE

05:07:26.227 --> 05:07:27.262
YOU TRYING TO GET THAT I THINK

05:07:27.328 --> 05:07:28.630
THE ONE THING THAT I CONTINUE

05:07:28.696 --> 05:07:30.598
TO STRUGGLE WITH IS THAT. AS I

05:07:30.665 --> 05:07:31.399
UNDERSTAND IT THE HUMPHRIES

05:07:31.466 --> 05:07:33.468
CASE DID A LOT OF THINGS SOME

05:07:33.535 --> 05:07:34.569
OF WHICH ARE HERE I THINK IT'S

05:07:34.636 --> 05:07:35.637
A WONDERFUL THING TO SEE IF

05:07:35.703 --> 05:07:36.971
THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES

05:07:37.038 --> 05:07:38.439
BESIDES HOLDING SOMEONE. THAT

05:07:38.506 --> 05:07:39.908
CAN PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY

05:07:39.974 --> 05:07:40.942
BEFORE WE EVER HOLD SOMEONE

05:07:41.009 --> 05:07:42.177
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT. WHEN

05:07:42.243 --> 05:07:43.945
SOMEONE ISN'T AT HOME TO CARRY

05:07:44.012 --> 05:07:45.513
ON THEIR JOB OR PAY THEIR RENTS

05:07:45.580 --> 05:07:48.917
THAT THAT AFFECTS THEIR ABILITY

05:07:48.983 --> 05:07:49.517
TO STAY. CLEAN AND NOT RUSTED

05:07:49.584 --> 05:07:52.053
OF EIGHT. BUT MY CONCERN IS

05:07:52.120 --> 05:07:53.988
THAT FOR SOMEONE WHO COMES IN.

05:07:54.055 --> 05:07:56.324
ON A LOW LEVEL OFFENSE. BUT FOR

05:07:56.391 --> 05:07:58.159
EXAMPLE THE OFFICERS FIND AN

05:07:58.226 --> 05:07:59.561
ARSENAL OF WEAPONS RIGHT BUT

05:07:59.627 --> 05:08:00.762
THAT'S- FINE. THAT'S NOT A

05:08:00.829 --> 05:08:03.998
FELON IN POSSESSION CASE- YOU

05:08:04.065 --> 05:08:05.900
KNOW THAT PERSON POSES A PUBLIC

05:08:05.967 --> 05:08:07.101
SAFETY THREAT AND UNDER THIS

05:08:07.168 --> 05:08:09.037
MODEL THE COURT WOULD HAVE NO

05:08:09.103 --> 05:08:10.238
JURISDICTION TO HOLD THAT

05:08:10.305 --> 05:08:11.773
INDIVIDUAL EVEN IF THE COURT

05:08:11.840 --> 05:08:13.441
AFTER THE HUMPHRIES ANALYSIS.

05:08:13.508 --> 05:08:14.709
FOUND CLEAR AND CONVINCING

05:08:14.776 --> 05:08:17.045
EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE A PUBLIC

05:08:17.111 --> 05:08:19.581
SAFETY RISK AND THAT CONCERNS

05:08:19.647 --> 05:08:20.114
ME IF I JUST WANTED YOU TO

05:08:20.181 --> 05:08:29.490
ADDRESS THAT. PAGE NINETEEN OF

05:08:29.557 --> 05:08:32.994
THE HUMPHRIES CASE SAYS. THAT

05:08:33.061 --> 05:08:34.429
WE IN SIMILARLY INTERPRET THE

05:08:34.495 --> 05:08:36.064
CONSTITUTION TO BAR COURT FROM

05:08:36.130 --> 05:08:37.265
CAUSING INTERESTED TO BE

05:08:37.332 --> 05:08:39.934
DETAINED PRE TRIAL BASED ON-

05:08:40.001 --> 05:08:41.336
CONCERNS REGARDING THE SAFETY

05:08:41.402 --> 05:08:42.971
OF THE PUBLIC IN VICTIM UNLESS

05:08:43.037 --> 05:08:44.806
THE COURT FINDS FIRST FINDS

05:08:44.873 --> 05:08:46.507
CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE

05:08:46.574 --> 05:08:47.575
THAT NO OTHER CONDITIONS OF

05:08:47.642 --> 05:08:48.576
RELEASE COULD MEANS WE PROTECT

05:08:48.643 --> 05:08:50.511
THOSE INTERESTS RIGHT GOES ON

05:08:50.578 --> 05:08:51.980
THE STATE ON REFLECTION WE

05:08:52.046 --> 05:08:53.781
AGREE WITH HUMPHRIES. THE

05:08:53.848 --> 05:08:54.582
HOBBIT THAT THE STANDARD OF

05:08:54.649 --> 05:08:56.251
PROOF SHOULD LIKEWISE BE CLEAR

05:08:56.317 --> 05:08:56.718
CONVINCING THERE'S NO

05:08:56.784 --> 05:08:58.419
COMPELLING REASON TO GO TO THE

05:08:58.486 --> 05:09:00.922
VERY STANDARD SO THE POINT IS I

05:09:00.989 --> 05:09:02.257
THINK THE CASE AND I DON'T WANT

05:09:02.323 --> 05:09:04.125
TO GET TO THE DEPRESSION HE

05:09:04.192 --> 05:09:06.561
RAISED FOR THE JUDGES JUST GAVE

05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:11.733
TO US- JUST. JUST RECENTLY. ON

05:09:11.799 --> 05:09:13.234
THIS IS REALLY A STICKY POIN

05:09:13.301 --> 05:09:15.203
IN THIS IN THIS WHOLE LARGER

05:09:15.270 --> 05:09:15.770
DISCUSSION BECAUSE THERE'S A

05:09:15.837 --> 05:09:17.672
SERIES OF DIFFERENT. THOUGHTS

05:09:17.739 --> 05:09:19.874
IN THIS WHOLE WORLD RIGHT. ONE

05:09:19.941 --> 05:09:22.110
OF THE BIG CHALLENGES IT YOU

05:09:22.176 --> 05:09:24.712
KNOW THE IDEA IS THAT. THERE'S

05:09:24.779 --> 05:09:25.947
NO DIRECT STATEMENT AS WE'VE

05:09:26.014 --> 05:09:27.282
TALKED ABOUT THAT SAYS THE

05:09:27.348 --> 05:09:29.450
COURT HAS THE RIGHT TO DO THIS

05:09:29.517 --> 05:09:30.485
IT JUST BUT THERE'S A

05:09:30.551 --> 05:09:31.619
CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD THAT'S

05:09:31.686 --> 05:09:33.488
IMPLICIT WHAT THE JUDGES TRADE

05:09:33.554 --> 05:09:35.189
ASSOCIATION AS OPPOSED TO

05:09:35.256 --> 05:09:36.124
JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE HAVE BEEN

05:09:36.190 --> 05:09:37.358
DEALING WITH THE JUDGES OF

05:09:37.425 --> 05:09:38.693
SITUATION. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

05:09:38.760 --> 05:09:39.994
VERY LOSELY WITH THE JUDICIAL

05:09:40.061 --> 05:09:41.696
COUNCIL THEY HAVE NOT OPPOSE

05:09:41.763 --> 05:09:43.831
THIS IT'S REALLY THE JUDGES.

05:09:43.898 --> 05:09:45.466
AND THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES

05:09:45.533 --> 05:09:47.368
THAT WERE FEARFUL OF. AN EARLY

05:09:47.435 --> 05:09:48.703
ANSWER TO IT TO BE VERY FRANK

05:09:48.770 --> 05:09:50.405
BUT IT'S VERY HARD AND I AGREE

05:09:50.471 --> 05:09:52.273
WITH- SOME OF THE ADVOCATES ON

05:09:52.340 --> 05:09:54.242
THE OTHER SIDE THAT HAVE

05:09:54.309 --> 05:09:55.209
OPPOSED PROP TWENTY FIVE AND

05:09:55.276 --> 05:09:58.546
THE LIKE. THEY FEEL. THAT

05:09:58.613 --> 05:09:59.614
WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE BILL

05:09:59.681 --> 05:10:01.015
INDUSTRY AND ONE OF THE REASONS

05:10:01.082 --> 05:10:02.817
WHY BAYLOR SO HIGH. IS THE

05:10:02.884 --> 05:10:05.119
JUDGE'S ARTIFICIALLY AGREE TO

05:10:05.186 --> 05:10:06.287
SETTING THESE THINGS HIGH WE

05:10:06.354 --> 05:10:07.255
HAVE EVIDENCE WITH A NO

05:10:07.322 --> 05:10:09.123
ATTENTION AT ALL. SO THAT WHAT

05:10:09.190 --> 05:10:10.091
THEY DO IS THEY CAN USE THE

05:10:10.158 --> 05:10:11.859
EXCUSE OF A HIGH BAIL TO KEEP

05:10:11.926 --> 05:10:13.695
SOMEBODY IN JAIL. WHO SHOULDN'T

05:10:13.761 --> 05:10:15.129
BE IN JAIL IS NOT A FLIGHT RISK

05:10:15.196 --> 05:10:16.998
IS NOT A PUBLIC RACES BUT THAT

05:10:17.065 --> 05:10:19.033
MIGHT RESULT IN A- IN A

05:10:19.100 --> 05:10:20.935
SITUATION FOR THEM LIKE. THE

05:10:21.002 --> 05:10:22.637
WILLIE HORTON CASE OR LIKE WHAT

05:10:22.704 --> 05:10:23.705
HAPPENED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WE

05:10:23.771 --> 05:10:25.473
REPRESENT. YOU KNOW WHERE JUDGE

05:10:25.540 --> 05:10:27.075
GETS TAKEN OUT. SO THEY'RE

05:10:27.141 --> 05:10:28.076
TRYING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES

05:10:28.142 --> 05:10:29.577
AND SO JUDGES IN THIS HAPPENED

05:10:29.644 --> 05:10:30.945
TO US IS ONE OF THE BIG DEBATES

05:10:31.012 --> 05:10:32.513
WE HAD WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE.

05:10:32.580 --> 05:10:34.282
AND THIS GROUP. TOGETHER WITH

05:10:34.349 --> 05:10:35.283
THE ADVOCATES OF THE OF THE

05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:38.186
SITE. WAS WHAT'S THE POWER OF

05:10:38.252 --> 05:10:40.321
THE COURT THERE'S A FEAR. AMONG

05:10:40.388 --> 05:10:42.490
PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPACTED. THE

05:10:42.557 --> 05:10:45.626
JUDGES ARE GOING TO BE TOO

05:10:45.693 --> 05:10:47.729
EASILY. MANIPULATED THAT REGARD

05:10:47.795 --> 05:10:49.530
AND SO WE WERE VERY CAUTIOUS SO

05:10:49.597 --> 05:10:50.932
WHAT THE WAY WE WROTE THIS AND

05:10:50.999 --> 05:10:52.033
THE REASON WHY WE WORK THIS WAY

05:10:52.100 --> 05:10:53.968
AND LEFT A- CONSTITUTIONAL

05:10:54.035 --> 05:10:55.870
STANDARD. BASED UPON THAT THE

05:10:55.937 --> 05:10:57.605
COURT PURSES. PUTTING A

05:10:57.672 --> 05:11:00.108
SPECIFIC PROVISION THAT SAYS IF

05:11:00.174 --> 05:11:02.343
THIS IS THE CASE. WE WANT TO GO

05:11:02.410 --> 05:11:03.711
THERE WE FELT THAT THE CASE WAS

05:11:03.778 --> 05:11:05.279
CLEAR ENOUGHIN THAT REGARD AND

05:11:05.346 --> 05:11:06.848
THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS

05:11:06.914 --> 05:11:08.983
IN THE CASE. WHERE WE DID NOT

05:11:09.050 --> 05:11:11.319
SPECIFICALLY. REVISED

05:11:11.386 --> 05:11:12.787
BLUEPRINTS FOR EXAMPLE WE SAID

05:11:12.854 --> 05:11:14.122
WE HAVEN'T CODIFIED THE

05:11:14.188 --> 05:11:15.390
CONDITIONS WERE PRE TRIAL.

05:11:15.456 --> 05:11:17.325
RELEASE A COURT MUST CONSIDER

05:11:17.392 --> 05:11:20.261
WE DID NOT. LOOK AT WHAT A

05:11:20.328 --> 05:11:21.629
COURT MUST LOOK FOR REAL LAST

05:11:21.696 --> 05:11:22.864
RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVES WITHIN

05:11:22.930 --> 05:11:24.165
JUST FINE WITH THOSE WHERE WE

05:11:24.232 --> 05:11:25.366
DIDN'T DEFINE THE COURT NEEDS

05:11:25.433 --> 05:11:26.434
TO CONDUCT A DUE PROCESS EQUAL

05:11:26.501 --> 05:11:28.903
PROTECTION. HEARING IN EACH

05:11:28.970 --> 05:11:30.405
CASE SO MY POINT TO YOU IS.

05:11:30.471 --> 05:11:32.273
WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THIS IN

05:11:32.340 --> 05:11:35.743
A WAY. THAT IS SENSITIVE TO AND

05:11:35.810 --> 05:11:37.678
UNDERSTANDS THE ARGUMENTS. BY

05:11:37.745 --> 05:11:39.047
PEOPLE THAT FEEL THAT WERE OVER

05:11:39.113 --> 05:11:40.681
POLICE THAT WERE IN A SITUATION

05:11:40.748 --> 05:11:42.083
WHERE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE.

05:11:42.150 --> 05:11:43.751
ARE INAPPROPRIATELY PUT IN JAIL

05:11:43.818 --> 05:11:45.153
THAT THEY'RE HELD IN JAIL THAT

05:11:45.219 --> 05:11:46.654
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OFFICE

05:11:46.721 --> 05:11:49.023
UNFAIR TO THEM. WHERE WE STILL

05:11:49.090 --> 05:11:49.957
HAVE THE GUIDANCE ON THE OTHER

05:11:50.024 --> 05:11:51.392
HAND THE CONSTITUTIONAL

05:11:51.459 --> 05:11:52.493
GUIDANCE WHICH I THINK IS

05:11:52.560 --> 05:11:54.629
CLEAR. BUT JUDGES YOU KNOW WHAT

05:11:54.695 --> 05:11:55.763
THEY WANT IS THEY WANT THE

05:11:55.830 --> 05:11:57.031
STATUTES SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO

05:11:57.098 --> 05:11:58.699
WORRY ABOUT MAKING A DECISION.

05:11:58.766 --> 05:12:00.201
AND SO LOOK WHAT WE'RE STILL

05:12:00.268 --> 05:12:00.935
LOOKING AT THAT I'M NOT

05:12:01.002 --> 05:12:02.804
SUGGESTING THAT WE'RE NOT. BUT

05:12:02.870 --> 05:12:04.839
I'M NOT A ON SENSITIVE CHIU.

05:12:04.906 --> 05:12:06.607
THE ARGUMENTS I'VE HEARD OVER

05:12:06.674 --> 05:12:09.010
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. ABOUT

05:12:09.077 --> 05:12:11.279
JUDGES OVER REACTING AND I

05:12:11.345 --> 05:12:11.979
WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE'S A

05:12:12.046 --> 05:12:13.614
DISTINCTION IN THE PUBLIC GET

05:12:13.681 --> 05:12:14.582
KILLED BY A BUNCH OF JUDGES ON

05:12:14.649 --> 05:12:16.417
THIS BUT- BETWEEN THE JUDICIAL

05:12:16.484 --> 05:12:17.552
COUNCIL WHICH IS LOOKING TO THE

05:12:17.618 --> 05:12:18.886
GOVERNANCE OF THE- JUDICIAL

05:12:18.953 --> 05:12:20.254
BRANCH. AND THE JUDGES

05:12:20.321 --> 05:12:21.255
ASSOCIATION WHICH IS A TRADE

05:12:21.322 --> 05:12:23.057
ASSOCIATION AND THERE'S A SPOT

05:12:23.124 --> 05:12:24.559
THERE AND THAT'S WHY THIS LATE

05:12:24.625 --> 05:12:26.194
LETTER THE CAME IN FROM A JUDGE

05:12:26.260 --> 05:12:28.362
ASSOCIATION I JUST SAW. IS

05:12:28.429 --> 05:12:29.630
DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE HOMEWORK

05:12:29.697 --> 05:12:30.665
THAT WE'VE DONE TO JUDICIAL

05:12:30.731 --> 05:12:32.733
COUNCIL. I DON'T THAT HELPS BUT

05:12:32.800 --> 05:12:33.868
I WANTED TO TRY TO BE SENSITIVE

05:12:33.935 --> 05:12:36.037
TO. THE LARGER ARGUMENT INTO

05:12:36.104 --> 05:12:37.371
BRICKS PLANE YOU AN HONEST AND

05:12:37.438 --> 05:12:39.407
DIRECT WAY. WHY WE'RE DEBATING

05:12:39.474 --> 05:12:40.374
THIS THING BUT WE'RE STILL

05:12:40.441 --> 05:12:41.776
LOOKING AT IT. WILL BE MEETING

05:12:41.843 --> 05:12:43.144
WITH THE ADVOCATES DURING THE

05:12:43.211 --> 05:12:44.879
BREAK HOPEFULLY IF THIS PASSES.

05:12:44.946 --> 05:12:46.247
AND TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT

05:12:46.314 --> 05:12:47.248
I AM SENSITIVE TO THEIR POINT

05:12:47.315 --> 05:12:48.483
OF VIEW. THANK YOU AND I

05:12:48.549 --> 05:12:49.984
APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK I

05:12:50.051 --> 05:12:51.119
ACTUALLY DID NOTICE THAT THE

05:12:51.185 --> 05:12:52.253
JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS NOT IN

05:12:52.320 --> 05:12:53.821
OPPOSITION TO THE JUDGE'S

05:12:53.888 --> 05:12:54.355
DECISION WITHIN FOUND THAT

05:12:54.422 --> 05:12:57.091

HUMPHREY STANDARD I THINK

05:13:02.964 --> 05:13:04.999
THAT'S APPROPRIATE I GUESS I

05:13:05.066 --> 05:13:05.600
STILL I JUST REMAIN CONCERNED

05:13:05.666 --> 05:13:07.435
ABOUT THAT. THE ONES THAT ARE

05:13:07.502 --> 05:13:08.669
COVERED BY THIS LAW FOR WHICH

05:13:08.736 --> 05:13:10.738
AND THERE WILL BE ZERO. FAIL

05:13:10.805 --> 05:13:12.073
AND THERE'S NO ANALYSIS A

05:13:12.140 --> 05:13:13.374
PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT I THINK WE

05:13:13.441 --> 05:13:14.509
REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THAT.

05:13:14.575 --> 05:13:16.310
AND WE IN THIS COMMITTEE GIVE

05:13:16.377 --> 05:13:18.346
JUDICIAL DISCRETION. ALL THE

05:13:18.412 --> 05:13:20.248
TIME WE DECIDED ON MISS ROLLINS

OFTEN SAYS THE JUDICIAL

05:13:24.619 --> 05:13:25.520
DISCRETION IS APPROPRIATE IT'S

05:13:25.586 --> 05:13:26.787
HARD FOR ME TO SAY THAT IN THIS

05:13:26.854 --> 05:13:31.993
CONTEXT IT'S NOT. AND SO I

05:13:32.059 --> 05:13:32.560
STRUGGLE TO SAY THAT. ON ON

05:31:53.693 --> 05:31:54.594
I'LL GIVE YOU LIKE WHAT WHAT

05:31:54.661 --> 05:31:55.862
WHAT TEN TWENTY WITH RIGHT NOW

05:31:55.929 --> 05:31:57.430
THAT'S A REAL. IS THAT WE HAVE

05:31:57.497 --> 05:31:58.865
JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN DETAINED

05:31:58.932 --> 05:32:00.600
OVER SIX HUNDRED JOURNALISTS IN

05:32:00.667 --> 05:32:02.602
THE YEAR OF LAST YEAR WERE

05:32:02.669 --> 05:32:05.939
EITHER DETAINED. ASSAULTED OR

05:32:06.006 --> 05:32:08.541
ATTACKED. SO THAT'S WHERE THE

05:32:08.608 --> 05:32:10.076
ISSUE THAT I FEEL THAT WE NEED

05:32:10.143 --> 05:32:11.611
TO BE FOCUSING ON IT IS A

05:32:11.678 --> 05:32:13.747
HYPOTHETICAL IN THIS STATE THAT

05:32:13.813 --> 05:32:15.782
AN INDIVIDUAL BASED OFF OF

05:32:15.849 --> 05:32:16.950
PRIOR EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO

05:32:17.017 --> 05:32:18.184
FAKE THAT THEY ARE A MEMBER OF

05:32:18.251 --> 05:32:21.621
THE MEDIA SO I I'M I'M- HAPPY

05:32:21.688 --> 05:32:22.756
TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS OKAY

05:32:22.822 --> 05:32:23.790
NINE POINT IS ANYBODY WITH A

05:32:23.857 --> 05:32:25.625
CAMERA CAN CLAIM THEY ARE PART

05:32:25.692 --> 05:32:28.128
OF A NEWS SERVICE OF SOME SORT.

05:32:28.194 --> 05:32:30.063
AND GO INTO AN AREA THAT IS AN

05:32:30.130 --> 05:32:33.566
INCIDENT COMMANDER YOU ARE

05:32:33.633 --> 05:32:35.435
RESPONSIBLE FOR. AS AN ELIGIBLE%

05:32:35.502 --> 05:32:36.469
FOR THE SAFETY WHEN I'M IN

05:32:36.536 --> 05:32:36.936
INCIDENT COMMANDER I'M

05:32:37.003 --> 05:32:38.638
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY. OF

05:32:38.705 --> 05:32:40.707
EVERYBODY IN THE AREA. AND IF

05:32:40.774 --> 05:32:41.775
I'M TRYING TO CLEAR OUT AN

05:32:41.841 --> 05:32:43.610
AREA. BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME

05:32:43.677 --> 05:32:45.111
TYPE OF DANGER OR ITS

05:32:45.178 --> 05:32:47.047
ESCALATING INTO SOMETHING ELSE.

05:32:47.113 --> 05:32:48.782
WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PEOPLE.

05:32:48.848 --> 05:32:51.051
IS MY RESPONSIBILITY. AND IF I

05:32:51.117 --> 05:32:53.420
HAVE A SOMEBODY WHO SAYS

05:32:53.486 --> 05:32:54.321
THEY'RE PART OF A NEW SERVICE

05:32:54.387 --> 05:32:58.558
GOING IN. AND USING THAT TO

05:32:58.625 --> 05:32:59.159
STAY IN AN AREA AND THEN THEY

05:32:59.225 --> 05:33:01.061
GET HURT. WELL GUESS WHO'S NOT

05:33:01.127 --> 05:33:03.129
WHO GUESSES ON HOPE FOR THAT.

05:33:03.196 --> 05:33:04.230
THE INCIDENT COMMANDER IN THE

05:33:04.297 --> 05:33:05.565
AGENCY THAT THEY REPRESENT THE

05:33:05.632 --> 05:33:06.733
INCIDENT COMMANDER STILL HAS

05:33:06.800 --> 05:33:08.268
THE OPPORTUNITY UNDER THIS BILL

05:33:08.335 --> 05:33:10.437
TO BE ABLE TO GO UP AND ASK AN

05:33:10.503 --> 05:33:11.838
INDIVIDUAL TO LEAVE RIGHT WELL

05:33:11.905 --> 05:33:13.640
I CAN TELL YOU IS AN IN THAT

05:33:13.707 --> 05:33:14.374
WHEN YOU'RE IN AN INCIDENT

05:33:14.441 --> 05:33:15.975
COMMAND POSITION. YOU DON'T

05:33:16.042 --> 05:33:17.510
HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO THROUGH

05:33:17.577 --> 05:33:19.012
A CROWD AND START PICKING OUT

05:33:19.079 --> 05:33:20.980
PEOPLE THAT ASKING QUESTIONS

05:33:21.047 --> 05:33:23.183
YOU'RE JUST HAVING YOU GIVE THE

05:33:23.249 --> 05:33:25.418
ORDER TO GO CLEAR THE AREA. AND

05:33:25.485 --> 05:33:26.753
IF THAT AREAS NOT BEING CLEARED

05:33:26.820 --> 05:33:28.455
OR PEOPLE ARE BEING INTERVIEWED

05:33:28.521 --> 05:33:30.223
AND SO THEY'RE NOT CLEARING

05:33:30.290 --> 05:33:31.791
THAT CREATES A PROBLEM SO THERE

05:33:31.858 --> 05:33:33.426

IT STARTS. BEING MORE VIOLENT

05:34:21.474 --> 05:34:22.609
THAT'S WHEN THEY BREAK OUT THE

05:34:22.675 --> 05:34:23.910
OTHER MEASURES THAT EVERYBODY

05:34:23.977 --> 05:34:25.578

SOME OF THOSE REMARKS THAT WERE

JUST MADE THAT THERE ARE

05:37:10.176 --> 05:37:12.378
TACTICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS THAT

05:38:05.198 --> 05:38:06.099
THAT AT LEAST IT'S BIT

05:38:06.165 --> 05:38:08.001
MISLEADING TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU

05:38:08.067 --> 05:38:09.535
GO INTO A BUILDING YOU CAN HAVE

05:38:09.602 --> 05:38:12.071

WITHIN THE CLOSED ACT. SECTION

05:38:15.575 --> 05:38:17.844
AND SO. THERE'S NO REGARD FOR

05:38:17.910 --> 05:38:20.980
TACTICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS. AND

05:38:21.047 --> 05:38:22.315
I THINK THAT. THE OTHER ISSUE

05:38:22.382 --> 05:38:23.516
THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED THE

05:38:23.583 --> 05:38:26.653
AMBIGUITY ORDER- THE AMBIGUITY

05:38:26.719 --> 05:38:28.721
OVER THE OFFICER'S ABILITY TO

05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:30.256
RECOGNIZE ON A ORDER TO

05:38:30.323 --> 05:38:33.693

PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND

05:38:35.762 --> 05:38:37.397
THOSE ARE ADVOCATING FOR THIS

05:38:37.463 --> 05:38:39.298
MEASURE. WOULD ACTUALLY

05:38:39.365 --> 05:38:41.234
EXPERIENCE A RIGHT AND

05:38:41.300 --> 05:38:43.736
UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT AND

05:38:43.803 --> 05:38:47.707
HOW CHAOTIC SCENES ARE. AND THE

05:38:47.774 --> 05:38:50.410
OBLIGATION OF LAW ENFORCERS IS

05:38:50.476 --> 05:38:52.645
TO RESTORE ORDER AND TO TRY TO

05:38:52.712 --> 05:38:55.181
MAKE AN AREA SAFE BECAUSE VERY

05:38:55.248 --> 05:38:56.949
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHO'S

05:38:57.016 --> 05:38:59.218
PRESSING WHO'S NOT PRESS WHEN

05:38:59.285 --> 05:39:01.387
YOU GIVE AN ORDER TO DISPERSE

05:39:01.454 --> 05:39:02.055
AND I FIND THAT TO BE VERY VERY

05:39:02.121 --> 05:39:04.123
TROUBLING AND THAT'S REASON I

05:39:04.190 --> 05:39:05.792

TRUE. GUN SHOWS ARE SENSUALLY A

05:59:11.529 --> 05:59:13.031
FLEA MARKET FOR FIREARMS THEIR

AGO AND WHILE THEY'RE WAITING

05:59:23.475 --> 05:59:24.876

05:59:35.153 --> 05:59:36.388
GUN SHOWS OFTEN CREATE THE

05:59:36.454 --> 05:59:37.822
OPPORTUNITY TO CIRCUMVENT GUN

05:59:37.889 --> 05:59:39.457
SAFETY LAWS AND ARE COMMON

05:59:39.524 --> 05:59:41.426
VENUE FOR STRAW PURCHASES AND

REPORT ALSO THIS HAS DESCRIBED

05:59:45.463 --> 05:59:46.164
GUN SHOWS AS A MAJOR

05:59:46.231 --> 05:59:47.666
TRAFFICKING CHANNEL. FOUND THE

05:59:47.732 --> 05:59:48.700
GUN SHOWS WERE THE SECOND

05:59:48.767 --> 05:59:50.235
LARGEST SOURCE OF ILLEGALLY

05:59:50.302 --> 05:59:52.203
TRAFFICKED FIREARMS. IT'S WORTH

05:59:52.270 --> 05:59:53.371
NOTING THAT WHILE I WISH I

CRIMES AND PROSECUTE DO THAT HI

06:00:00.946 --> 06:00:02.614
HOW ARE AMENDMENTS. IT IS

06:00:02.681 --> 06:00:03.715
WIDELY BELIEVED THOUGH THAT GUN

06:00:03.782 --> 06:00:05.483
SHOWS ARE MAJOR CONDUIT PERHAPS

06:00:05.550 --> 06:00:07.385
THE MAJOR CONDUIT NOT ONLY FOR

DESIGNED TO BE ASSEMBLED INTO A

GHOST GUNS ARE NOT TECHNICALLY

06:00:16.594 --> 06:00:18.029
FIREARMS THEY DON'T HAVE SERIAL

GHOST GUN KITS. DESIGNED TO

06:00:26.705 --> 06:00:28.773
TURN IN A FIREARMS AKIN TO

06:00:28.840 --> 06:00:29.841
GLOCK PISTOLS AND A R. FIFTEEN

06:00:29.908 --> 06:00:31.409

TAKEN RIGHT OFF OF THE LOT. BUT

06:00:35.013 --> 06:00:36.181
I WILL ALSO SUBMIT TO YOU THAT

06:00:36.247 --> 06:00:37.682
EVEN IF THEY WERE ZERO SALES OF

06:00:37.749 --> 06:00:39.517
ILLEGAL OR UNLICENSED GUNS. OR

06:00:39.584 --> 06:00:41.252
GHOST GUNS. WE SHOULD STILL

06:00:41.319 --> 06:00:42.821
SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND THAT IS

06:00:42.887 --> 06:00:44.356
BECAUSE GUN SHOWS ARE DESIGNED

06:00:44.422 --> 06:00:46.124
FOR ONE PURPOSE. TO SELL GUNS

06:00:46.191 --> 06:00:48.126
IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THEY

06:00:48.193 --> 06:00:48.927
ARE INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE AT

06:00:48.994 --> 06:00:50.662
THAT PURPOSE. AND THIS IS SUCH

06:00:50.729 --> 06:00:52.530
A DEADLY DEADLY PROBLEM. AS

06:00:52.597 --> 06:00:55.066
STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN.

06:00:55.133 --> 06:00:55.567
MORE GUNS MEANS MORE GUN

06:00:55.633 --> 06:00:57.769
VIOLENCE. YOU CAN LOOK THIS UP

06:00:57.836 --> 06:00:59.104
THE HARVARD HARVARD BUREAU OF

INTERCOLLEGIATE STUDIES AND

06:01:02.440 --> 06:01:04.242
MANY OTHER STUDIES. COUNTRIES

06:01:05.176 --> 06:01:07.245
VIOLENCE. STATES WITH MORE GUNS

06:01:07.312 --> 06:01:08.480
HAVE MORE GUN VIOLENCE.

06:01:08.546 --> 06:01:10.482
HOUSEHOLDS WITH MORE GUNS ARE

06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.982
MORE LIKELY TO HAVE GUN

06:01:11.049 --> 06:01:12.484
VIOLENCE. NOW SINCE THAT

06:01:12.550 --> 06:01:13.852
WEEKEND WHEN WE HAD THE EL PASO

06:01:13.918 --> 06:01:15.320
IN DAYTON SHOOTINGS THAT

06:01:15.387 --> 06:01:16.554
WEEKEND WHEN I VOWED TO END GUN

SHOWS. IN THE STATE AND COUNTY

06:01:18.490 --> 06:01:20.492
FAIRGROUNDS WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS

06:01:20.558 --> 06:01:22.460
OF MASS SHOOTINGS. INCLUDING

06:01:22.527 --> 06:01:23.094
THE MASS SHOOTING PREVIOUSLY IN

06:01:23.161 --> 06:01:25.563
SAN JOSE. THE MASS SHOOTING IN

06:01:26.431 --> 06:01:28.733
THIS YEAR. OVER FIFTY THOUSAND

06:01:28.800 --> 06:01:29.834
AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES

06:01:29.901 --> 06:01:31.269
INCLUDING THE NINE VICTIMS OF

06:01:31.336 --> 06:01:31.903
THE RECENT MASS SHOOTING IN SAN

06:01:31.970 --> 06:01:33.972

06:01:34.039 --> 06:01:34.906
PEOPLE ANYONE SHOOTING I

06:01:34.973 --> 06:01:36.641
MENTIONED AND SIX YEAR OLD ETAN

06:01:36.708 --> 06:01:37.842
LEOS WHO WAS MURDERED IN MY

06:01:37.909 --> 06:01:38.843
DISTRICT BY SOMEONE WHO IS

06:01:38.910 --> 06:01:40.412
APPARENTLY HAVING ROAD RAGE ON

06:01:40.478 --> 06:01:42.781
THE FIFTY FIVE. EACH OF THESE

06:01:42.847 --> 06:01:44.682
VIOLENT DEATHS FOR A MASSIVE

06:01:44.749 --> 06:01:46.918
HOLE IN THEIR FAMILIES. IN

06:01:46.985 --> 06:01:47.519
THEIR COMMUNITIES AMONG THEIR

06:01:47.585 --> 06:01:49.921
LOVED ONES. NOW PROPONENTS OF

06:01:49.988 --> 06:01:51.489
GUN SHOWS ARGUE THAT ENDING GUN

06:01:51.556 --> 06:01:52.624
SHOWS WILL DEPRIVE THEM OF

06:01:52.690 --> 06:01:54.426
REVENUE BUT I WILL POINT OUT

06:01:54.492 --> 06:01:55.226
THAT THIS IS JUST A SMALL

06:01:55.293 --> 06:01:56.127
FRACTION OF THE REVENUE

06:01:56.194 --> 06:01:57.695
GENERATED BY THE FAIRGROUNDS.

06:01:57.762 --> 06:01:59.064
AND IT IS INDISPUTABLE THAT THE

06:01:59.130 --> 06:02:00.165
COSTS OF GUN VIOLENCE ARE

06:02:00.231 --> 06:02:02.567
ASTRONOMICALLY HIGHER. IN FACT-

06:02:02.634 --> 06:02:03.735
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR

06:02:03.802 --> 06:02:04.536
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM

06:02:04.602 --> 06:02:06.738
ESTIMATED THE COST ANNUAL COSTS

06:02:06.805 --> 06:02:08.006
OF GUN VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA

06:02:08.073 --> 06:02:09.541
OR SIX POINT FIVE BILLION

06:02:09.607 --> 06:02:10.942
DOLLARS A YEAR THAT IS

06:02:11.009 --> 06:02:12.343
EXPONENTIALLY MORE THAN THE

06:02:12.410 --> 06:02:13.545
REVENUE THE SMALL AMOUNT OF

06:02:13.611 --> 06:02:15.246
REVENUE THAT WE RECEIVED FROM

06:02:15.313 --> 06:02:16.815
THESE GUN SHOWS IN THE STATE.

06:02:16.881 --> 06:02:18.016
THE OPPOSITION ALSO CLAIMS THAT

06:02:18.083 --> 06:02:19.684
THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR AND THAT

06:02:19.751 --> 06:02:20.585
WE SHOULD LEAVE THIS UP TO

06:02:20.652 --> 06:02:21.753
COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS. AS A MATTER

06:02:21.820 --> 06:02:24.989
OF LOCAL CONTROL. THAT WOULD BE

06:02:25.056 --> 06:02:26.091
GREAT IF IT AS TRUE BUT IF YOU

06:02:26.157 --> 06:02:27.859
TALK TO BOARD MEMBERS OF COUNTY

06:02:27.926 --> 06:02:29.160
FAIRGROUNDS. THEY WILL TELL YOU

06:02:29.227 --> 06:02:30.662
THEY HAVE NO FIDUCIARY DUTIES

06:02:30.728 --> 06:02:32.130
TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. THEIR

06:02:32.197 --> 06:02:33.765
SOLE FIDUCIARY DUTY LIES WITH

06:02:33.832 --> 06:02:34.999
ENSURING THE SOLVENCY THERE

06:02:35.066 --> 06:02:35.834
DROUGHT FAIRGROUNDS AND

06:02:35.900 --> 06:02:37.335
MAXIMIZING REVENUE. AS THEY

06:02:37.402 --> 06:02:38.603
WILL TELL YOU THEY'RE OBLIGATED

06:02:38.670 --> 06:02:39.404
TO CONTRACT WITH GUN SHOW

06:02:39.471 --> 06:02:40.872
OPERATORS NO MATTER WHAT THE

06:02:40.939 --> 06:02:42.540
PREFERENCES OF LOCAL COMMUNITY.

06:02:42.607 --> 06:02:43.541
AND THAT THEREFORE THE ONLY

06:02:43.608 --> 06:02:45.743
SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS SAY

06:02:45.810 --> 06:02:48.246
REGULATION. I ALSO WANT TO PUSH

06:02:48.313 --> 06:02:49.347
BACK ON THIS OR EVEN A LOCAL

06:02:49.414 --> 06:02:50.048
CONTROL AS A MATTER OF

06:02:50.115 --> 06:02:50.982
PRINCIPLE BECAUSE THERE ARE

06:02:51.049 --> 06:02:52.450
MANY INSTANCES WHERE WE DECIDE

06:02:52.517 --> 06:02:53.751
THERE ARE CERTAIN STATEWIDE

06:02:53.818 --> 06:02:55.920
VALUES. THAT WE WANT TO PROMOTE

06:02:55.987 --> 06:02:57.021
REGARDLESS OF WHAT LOCALS MAY

06:02:57.088 --> 06:02:58.923
THINK. WE REQUIRE THAT CHILDREN

06:02:58.990 --> 06:03:00.125
BE VACCINATED REQUIRES THAT

06:03:00.191 --> 06:03:01.392

DANGEROUS CONDITIONS OR SEXUAL

06:03:02.861 --> 06:03:04.963
HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT. REQUIRE

06:03:05.029 --> 06:03:05.530
THE CERTAIN HEALTH ND LABOR

06:03:05.597 --> 06:03:07.432
STANDARDS BE MET. AND WE DO

06:03:07.499 --> 06:03:08.800
THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT SOME

06:03:08.867 --> 06:03:09.834
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MAY

06:03:09.901 --> 06:03:10.969
DISAGREE WITH OUR STATEWIDE

06:03:11.035 --> 06:03:12.837
STANDARDS AND MANDATES. WELL I

06:03:12.904 --> 06:03:13.938
THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

06:03:14.005 --> 06:03:14.706
VALUE THAT WE'RE MAKING TODAY

06:03:14.772 --> 06:03:16.107
VALUE STATEMENT. WHAT WE'RE

06:03:16.174 --> 06:03:17.208
SAYING TODAY IS THAT THE STATE

06:03:17.275 --> 06:03:18.543
OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT GOING TO

06:03:18.610 --> 06:03:20.078
CONTINUE SANCTIONING. AND

06:03:20.145 --> 06:03:21.479
ENDORSING THE DISTRIBUTION OF

06:03:21.546 --> 06:03:23.815
GUNS INTO OUR COMMUNITIES OUT

06:03:23.882 --> 06:03:25.683
OF STATE PROPERTY. NOW A NUMBER

06:03:25.750 --> 06:03:26.818
OF FOLKS HAVE ALSO RAISED THE

06:03:26.885 --> 06:03:27.852
SECOND AMENDMENT IS A CONCERN

06:03:27.919 --> 06:03:29.587

AMENDMENT. THIS IS NOT AFFECT

06:03:34.692 --> 06:03:35.160
THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS BY

06:03:35.226 --> 06:03:37.595
INDIVIDUALS- IT MERELY SAYS

06:03:37.662 --> 06:03:39.063
THAT THE STATE WILL NOT BE PART

06:03:39.130 --> 06:03:40.665
OF THAT DISSEMINATION OF GUNS

06:03:40.732 --> 06:03:42.400
IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE SECOND

06:03:42.467 --> 06:03:43.535
AMENDMENT EXISTS IN OUR

06:03:43.601 --> 06:03:45.737
CONSTITUTION IT ALLOWS FOR THE

06:03:45.803 --> 06:03:47.805
REASONABLE REGULATION OF GUNS-

06:03:47.872 --> 06:03:49.140
THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS. BUT

06:03:49.207 --> 06:03:49.607
THERE'S ALSO THE TENTH

06:03:49.674 --> 06:03:50.842
AMENDMENT THAT PRESERVES THE

QUESTION COMMON. MISTER CLARK.

06:36:50.086 --> 06:36:51.854
MY FIRM BELIEF IS THAT A GUN IS

06:36:51.921 --> 06:36:53.089
THE MOST DANGEROUS THING YOU

06:36:53.156 --> 06:36:55.691
CAN HAVE IN YOUR HOUSE- THE

06:36:55.758 --> 06:36:57.493
MOST LIKELY USE OF A GUN IS TO

06:36:57.560 --> 06:37:05.735
pBY SUICIDE- OR ACCIDENT OR-

06:37:05.801 --> 06:37:07.570
THROUGH. AN ARGUMENT FOR

06:37:07.637 --> 06:37:08.638
EXAMPLE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO

06:37:08.704 --> 06:37:10.406
MARVIN GAYE'S FATHER SHOT HIM

06:37:10.473 --> 06:37:13.576
IN THE HEART. AT ANY RATE SO I

06:37:13.643 --> 06:37:15.778
I'M DEFINITELY NOT PRO GUN BUT

06:37:15.845 --> 06:37:17.914
MY CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILL IS

06:37:17.980 --> 06:37:19.882
ALL YOU'RE DOINGIS MOVING THEM

06:37:19.949 --> 06:37:21.817
OFF THE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS TO

06:37:21.884 --> 06:37:24.921
SOMEWHERE ELSE- I WOULD BE MUCH

06:37:24.987 --> 06:37:26.956
MORE IN FAVOR OF A BILL THAT

06:37:27.023 --> 06:37:29.458
SIMPLY. IF YOU FEEL THERE'S

06:37:29.525 --> 06:37:31.227
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY GOING ON THAT

06:37:31.294 --> 06:37:33.529
EITHER DOES SOMETHING TO MAKE

06:37:33.596 --> 06:37:35.131
SURE THAT THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN

06:37:35.198 --> 06:37:37.800
AT STATE FAIRGROUNDS OUR DOES

06:37:37.867 --> 06:37:38.668
NOT HAPPEN IN THE STATE AS A

06:37:38.734 --> 06:37:40.603
WHOLE. I JUST DON'T SEE WHERE

06:37:40.670 --> 06:37:42.572
THIS MOVES THE BOOK THE BALL

06:37:42.638 --> 06:37:45.107
FORWARD IN TERMS OF MAKING

06:37:45.174 --> 06:37:47.076
CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFE. IS THAT

06:37:47.143 --> 06:37:49.478
A QUESTION ARE. YOU CAN

06:37:49.545 --> 06:37:51.881
ANSWERED IN YOUR CLOTHES. OKAY

06:37:51.948 --> 06:37:54.150

RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE

06:38:01.057 --> 06:38:03.626
OPPOSITION- I DO THINK IT'S

06:38:03.693 --> 06:38:05.161
IMPORTANT THAT WE BE TRUTHFUL

06:38:05.228 --> 06:38:07.563
AS THEY REPEATEDLY STATED- BUT

06:38:07.630 --> 06:38:09.432
I IT IS NOT TRUTHFUL TO STATE

06:38:09.498 --> 06:38:10.466
THAT THERE ARE NO ILLEGAL

06:38:10.533 --> 06:38:12.134
FIREARMS ARE UNLICENSED

06:38:12.201 --> 06:38:14.070
FIREARMS SOLD AT GUN SHOWS. AS

06:38:14.136 --> 06:38:15.538
YOU HEARD FROM THE FORMER CHIEF

JUSTICE'S BUREAU FIREARMS THERE

06:38:18.641 --> 06:38:19.942
ARE MANY INSTANCES OF THIS IN

06:38:20.009 --> 06:38:21.277
FACT I BELIEVE THAT IN A RECENT

06:38:21.344 --> 06:38:23.312
SENATE REPORT I WAS TOLD THIS

06:38:23.379 --> 06:38:24.747
ANECDOTALLY- THE SAME

06:38:24.814 --> 06:38:26.315
CONCLUSIONS REACH WE KNOW THAT

06:38:26.382 --> 06:38:28.251
THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES. OF

06:38:28.317 --> 06:38:30.152
ILLEGAL AND UNLICENSED FIREARMS

06:38:30.219 --> 06:38:32.755
BEING SOLD AT GUN SHOWS- I ALSO

06:38:32.822 --> 06:38:34.223
WANT TO DISAGREE RESPECTFULLY

06:38:34.290 --> 06:38:36.359
WITH THE- ASSESSMENT ON THE

06:38:36.425 --> 06:38:37.293
SEVEN MINUTE WE'VE REFERRED TO

06:38:37.360 --> 06:38:39.262
COUNCIL I WE DO NOT BELIEVE

06:38:39.328 --> 06:38:40.296
THERE'S A SECOND AMENDMENT

06:38:40.363 --> 06:38:40.796
ISSUE I APPRECIATE THE

06:38:40.863 --> 06:38:42.865
CONSTITUTIONAL WHILE LAST NIGHT

06:38:42.932 --> 06:38:44.166
WAS A FORMER LAW PROFESSOR BUT

06:38:44.233 --> 06:38:45.801
I TAUGHT CONTRACTS SO I'M NOT A

06:38:45.868 --> 06:38:46.469
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW EXPERT

06:38:46.535 --> 06:38:48.738
MYSELF- BUT THE DECISION THOSE

06:38:48.804 --> 06:38:50.573
REFERENCE MCDONALD V. CHICAGO.

06:38:50.640 --> 06:38:52.475
SIMPLY STATES AS I UNDERSTAND

06:38:52.541 --> 06:38:54.343
IT THAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT

06:38:54.410 --> 06:38:55.278
APPLIES TO STATES AND

06:38:55.344 --> 06:38:57.146
LOCALITIES THAT'S SIMPLY SAYS

06:38:57.213 --> 06:38:58.547
THAT WE HAVE TO RESPECT THE

06:38:58.614 --> 06:39:00.082
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS WITH AS PART

06:39:00.149 --> 06:39:01.183
OF A RIGHT WELL REGULATED

06:39:01.250 --> 06:39:02.752
MILITIA. IT DOES NOT SAY

06:39:02.818 --> 06:39:03.619
ANYWHERE IN THE SECOND

06:39:03.686 --> 06:39:06.255
AMENDMENT THE STATE'S MUST USE

06:39:06.322 --> 06:39:08.090
THEIR PROPERTY TO SELL GUNS

06:39:08.157 --> 06:39:09.225
THAT WE MUST BE COMPLICIT IN

06:39:09.292 --> 06:39:10.926
THIS AND THIS GETS ME TO

06:39:10.993 --> 06:39:12.928
SOMEONE RECORDS QUESTION. I

06:39:12.995 --> 06:39:15.531
BELIEVE RIGHT NOW LOOK HERE'S

06:39:15.598 --> 06:39:16.399
AFFECT. GUN SHOWS ARE

06:39:16.465 --> 06:39:17.667
RESPONSIBLE FOR A HIGH

06:39:17.733 --> 06:39:19.602
PROPORTION.OF GUNS BEING SOLD

06:39:19.669 --> 06:39:20.803
IN THE STATE SO THERE'S ALWAYS

06:39:20.870 --> 06:39:21.904
THE WHAT IF WILL THAT. BE LIKE

06:39:21.971 --> 06:39:23.406
A COMPRESSION WE'RE JUST MOVING

06:39:23.472 --> 06:39:25.574
GUNS INTO. LESS REGULATED PARTS

06:39:25.641 --> 06:39:27.510
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT-

06:39:27.576 --> 06:39:28.778
OTHER THAN RIGHT NOW THEY'RE

06:39:28.844 --> 06:39:29.945
RESPONSIBLE FOR INORDINATE

06:39:30.012 --> 06:39:31.580
NUMBER OF GUNS I WE DON'T HAVE

06:39:31.647 --> 06:39:33.282
STATISTICS I ASKED- IN ORANGE

06:39:33.349 --> 06:39:34.717
COUNTY DO WE KNOW WHERE THE GUN

06:39:34.784 --> 06:39:36.285
THAT WAS USED TO KILL A LEO'S

06:39:36.352 --> 06:39:37.853
THE SIX YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS

06:39:37.920 --> 06:39:38.754
KILLED IN ACT ROAD RAGE CAME

06:39:38.821 --> 06:39:40.089
FROM. AND I TOLD ME WE WOULD

06:39:40.156 --> 06:39:41.857
GET BACK TO ME. BUT WE KNOW IT

06:39:41.924 --> 06:39:42.958
WAS LEGALLY PURCHASED WHICH

06:39:43.025 --> 06:39:44.593
MEANS PROBABLY IS A FIFTY FIFTY

06:39:44.660 --> 06:39:45.328
CHANCE THAT WAS PURCHASED AT A

06:39:45.394 --> 06:39:46.395
GUN SHOW IN ORANGE COUNTY SINCE

06:39:46.462 --> 06:39:48.764
I BELIEVE. THAT ROUGHLY 50% OF

06:39:48.831 --> 06:39:50.866
GUNS IN MY AREA ARE ARE

06:39:50.933 --> 06:39:52.234
PURCHASED AT THE GUN SHOWS.

06:39:52.301 --> 06:39:53.669
THAT THAT IS JUST AN

06:39:53.736 --> 06:39:55.271
UNACCEPTABLE CROSS TO BEAR AND

06:39:55.338 --> 06:39:57.006
WE SOLVE THAT PROBLEM NOW BUT I

06:39:57.073 --> 06:39:58.374
ALSO THINK WE ESTABLISH A LINE

06:39:58.441 --> 06:40:00.042
IN THE SAND. THAT SAYS THE

06:40:00.109 --> 06:40:01.610
STATE SHALL NOT BE COMPLICIT

06:40:01.677 --> 06:40:02.845
THAT WERE THE ARGUMENTS BEING
