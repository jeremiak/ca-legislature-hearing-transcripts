OF THE DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN

00:24:43.115 --> 00:24:46.051 region:rollup2
RESOLVED. THE ONE REMAINING

00:24:44.383 --> 00:24:46.952 region:rollup2
ISSUE I JUST WANNA RAISE HIS OF

00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:48.587 region:rollup2
COURSE IS THE SHARING OF

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:50.856 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AMONG THE DIFFERENT

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:53.292 region:rollup2
HEROES. OTHERS TO ISSUES THAT WE

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:54.960 region:rollup2
SEE THERE ONE IT'S A TECHNOLOGY

00:24:53.292 --> 00:24:56.428 region:rollup2
ABOUT TRYING TO SET UP A SYSTEM

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.830 region:rollup2

ALERT SYSTEM DOES BEEN SET UP.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.1000 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THAT WAS SET UP THROUGH

00:24:59.398 --> 00:25:03.936 region:rollup2
A CONGRESSIONAL ACTION IT TOOK.

00:25:00.1000 --> 00:25:04.436 region:rollup2
NO SOMETIME TO GET A SYSTEM SET

00:25:03.936 --> 00:25:04.770 region:rollup2
UP TO TRY TO SHARE THAT

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:05.804 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.239 region:rollup2
BUT THE BIGGEST PART ABOUT

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:08.807 region:rollup2
SHARING INFORMATION IS THAT EACH

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:09.274 region:rollup2
OF THE BUREAU'S WANT TO

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:10.809 region:rollup2
AUTHENTICATE THEIR OWN

00:25:09.274 --> 00:25:13.012 region:rollup2

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:14.079 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DATA SET.

00:25:13.012 --> 00:25:16.215 region:rollup2

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:17.683 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE

00:25:16.215 --> 00:25:18.817 region:rollup2

00:25:23.222 --> 00:25:25.791 region:rollup2

00:25:24.957 --> 00:25:27.192 region:rollup2
SHOULD THE SENATE BRING IN

00:25:25.791 --> 00:25:29.395 region:rollup2
WITNESSES WHY DON'T WE JUST SEND

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:29.862 region:rollup2
OVER THE TRANSCRIPT AND LET THEM

00:25:29.395 --> 00:25:30.896 region:rollup2
DECIDE BASED UPON THE

00:25:29.862 --> 00:25:32.631 region:rollup2
TRANSCRIPT.

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:33.632 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY SIMILAR HERE BECAUSE

00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:35.167 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SENATE WANTS

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:36.235 region:rollup2
TO ASSN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TO

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:38.036 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE

00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:39.304 region:rollup2
ANSWERS THAT THEY NEED. WE WANT

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:41.140 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING TO OCCUR IN THIS

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:42.708 region:rollup2
PROCESS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.110 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD THE IDENTIFIED

00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:47.246 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL THAT HE WHO SAYS WHO

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.647 region:rollup2
HE IS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S

00:25:47.246 --> 00:25:49.915 region:rollup2
NO LIABILITY AND ARE PART.

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:51.950 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY UNDER THE LAW WE

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:53.986 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.788 region:rollup2
EACH CONSUMER WITH INFORMATION

00:25:53.986 --> 00:25:58.123 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW A FREEZE WORKS AND

00:25:55.788 --> 00:25:59.658 region:rollup2
ALSO A PASSWORD AND A PEN. SO

00:25:58.123 --> 00:26:01.660 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION HERE IS WHAT WHAT

00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:03.195 region:rollup2
DO WE DO IN THAT CASE SO FOR

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.897 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE EXPERIENCE SENDS US

00:26:03.195 --> 00:26:06.632 region:rollup2
OVER INFORMATION TO TRAINED

00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:08.400 region:rollup2
UNION ST WEEK AND HAVE TO PUT IN

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:10.335 region:rollup2
A FREEZE. WE STILL HAVE TO

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.571 region:rollup2
NOTIFY THE CONSUMER ABOUT GIVING

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:13.739 region:rollup2
THEM A PASSWORD. AND OR ATTEND

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:15.407 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDE THEM HOW THE FREEZE

00:26:13.739 --> 00:26:17.276 region:rollup2
WORKS AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:18.744 region:rollup2
WAIT STATED IN THE LAW. SO THESE

00:26:17.276 --> 00:26:20.379 region:rollup2
ARE SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES THAT

00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:21.880 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON A

00:26:20.379 --> 00:26:23.415 region:rollup2

BRIEF ONE IS.

00:40:26.491 --> 00:40:30.028 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD JUST LEGISLATIVE LEAD

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:31.729 region:rollup2
TO IT TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES

00:40:30.028 --> 00:40:32.797 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:34.532 region:rollup2
THE LAW MOVES SLOWER THAN

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:35.800 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY SO WE DON'T DISAGREE

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:37.135 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE AND WE'RE

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.569 region:rollup2
NOT SAYING THAT INDUSTRY SHOULD

00:40:37.135 --> 00:40:39.604 region:rollup2
SELF REGULATE.

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:40.972 region:rollup2
WE'RE SAYING THE BETTER AVENUE

00:40:39.604 --> 00:40:42.240 region:rollup2
IS A.

00:40:40.972 --> 00:40:43.374 region:rollup2

00:40:44.943 --> 00:40:47.478 region:rollup2
NIMBLE AND WERE QUICKLY CAN

00:40:46.144 --> 00:40:48.846 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE INNOVATIVE NEED SO

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:51.649 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS BILL.

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:53.318 region:rollup2
GOES TOO FAR OR NOT FAR ENOUGH

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:55.553 region:rollup2
OR COULD HAMPER THINGS THE OTHER

00:40:53.318 --> 00:40:56.788 region:rollup2
THING IS TOM PROBABLY WHY YOU

00:40:55.553 --> 00:40:57.889 region:rollup2
SEE SOME INDUSTRY DIVIDED

00:40:56.788 --> 00:41:00.091 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE THE

00:40:57.889 --> 00:41:01.426 region:rollup2
ONLY BILL THE. ONLY INDUSTRY

00:41:00.091 --> 00:41:02.927 region:rollup2
MAKE REAL OF MANUFACTURES OF

MAKE THEIR PRODUCT AND SELL THEM

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:06.531 region:rollup2
OF THE BRAND THE WAY THE

00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:09.300 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURES TO FIND. ONLY

00:41:06.531 --> 00:41:10.635 region:rollup2
IMPACTS MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE

OEMS ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT

00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:13.271 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS WHO ALSO SELL

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:14.706 region:rollup2

00:41:13.271 --> 00:41:16.407 region:rollup2
PRODUCT IN CHINA OR SOMEWHERE

00:41:14.706 --> 00:41:17.642 region:rollup2
ELSE THEN PUT YOUR BRAND ON IT

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:18.242 region:rollup2
THEN THE WAY THE MANUFACTURES

00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:19.944 region:rollup2
DEFINED COULD NOT BE IMPACTED

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:22.447 region:rollup2
SO.

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:23.281 region:rollup2
FOR US IT HITS HOME BECAUSE IT

00:41:22.447 --> 00:41:26.284 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IMPACTS US.

00:41:23.281 --> 00:41:26.851 region:rollup2
THE REASONABLE SECURITY STANDARD

00:41:26.284 --> 00:41:28.252 region:rollup2

AND.

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:31.990 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE CAN THAT'LL JUST

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:33.291 region:rollup2
OPEN US TOO LEGIT LITIGATION AND

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:35.693 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY.

00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:37.662 region:rollup2
AND BY HAVING THE SAFE HARBOR

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:39.163 region:rollup2
ISSUES WHERE YOU HAVE A PASSWORD

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:40.865 region:rollup2
THE PASSWORD MIGHT ALREADY BE

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:42.767 region:rollup2
OBSOLETE NOW HAVE FINGERPRINT

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:44.502 region:rollup2
AND FACIAL RECOGNITION SO. WE

00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:46.037 region:rollup2
DON'T TO BE LOCKED INTO A SAFE

00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:48.473 region:rollup2
HARBOR THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY

00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:49.407 region:rollup2
BE THE BEST AUTHENTICATION AND.

00:41:48.473 --> 00:41:50.675 region:rollup2
AND PROTECTION BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:41:49.407 --> 00:41:52.377 region:rollup2
TO STAY ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE

00:41:50.675 --> 00:41:55.079 region:rollup2
BAD GUYS AND LOCKING IT IS NOT

00:41:52.377 --> 00:41:56.180 region:rollup2
HELPFUL. LAST POINT IS THAT THEY

00:41:55.079 --> 00:41:57.281 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE A FISCAL NOTE

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:59.951 region:rollup2
THIS'LL OBVIOUSLY IS BEING

00:41:57.281 --> 00:42:01.919 region:rollup2
FORCED BY THE CALIFORNIA AG AND

00:41:59.951 --> 00:42:03.287 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S FISCAL IMPACTS SO. IT

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:05.623 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE A FISCAL.

00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:06.257 region:rollup2
IMPACT THAT SHOULD BE SHOULD BE

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:07.725 region:rollup2

BUT WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE

00:42:43.194 --> 00:42:45.997 region:rollup2
NATURE OF THE PROBLEM WE WE

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:47.465 region:rollup2
DISAGREE ABOUT THE NATURE SO THE

00:42:45.997 --> 00:42:48.800 region:rollup2
SOLUTION MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT

00:42:47.465 --> 00:42:50.068 region:rollup2
THE BAD ACTORS HERE. WE'RE

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.669 region:rollup2
LEADING THE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:42:50.068 --> 00:42:52.737 region:rollup2
CYBERSECURITY SOLUTIONS AT THE

CYBERSECURITY COLLABORATION THE

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.977 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS AS WE SECURE DEVICES

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:00.912 region:rollup2
THERE ARE BAD ACTORS THEY'RE

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:02.280 region:rollup2
KEEPING PACE AND DEVELOPING

00:43:00.912 --> 00:43:03.581 region:rollup2
EQUAL MORE SOPHISTICATED TOOLS

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.816 region:rollup2
TO HACK THEM.

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:06.417 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THE FOCUS SHOULD BE.

00:43:04.816 --> 00:43:08.352 region:rollup2
TOWARD STOPPING THEM NOT

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:09.287 region:rollup2
IMPOSING A STICK PARA SANCTIONS

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:10.755 region:rollup2
AND POTENTIALLY ARBITRARY

00:43:09.287 --> 00:43:12.390 region:rollup2
STANDARDS ON THE VICTIMS

00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:13.591 region:rollup2
A A. B. NINETEEN OH SIX INVITES

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:15.026 region:rollup2
US DOWN THIS ROAD.

00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:16.794 region:rollup2
OF ARBITRARY STANDARDS SETTING

00:43:15.026 --> 00:43:18.129 region:rollup2
WITH ITS REASONABLE TEST OF OF

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:19.097 region:rollup2
SECURITY FEATURES BUT WITH ALL

00:43:18.129 --> 00:43:20.431 region:rollup2
THIS VERY THING IN TWENTY

00:43:19.097 --> 00:43:21.732 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN WITH THE CALVARY

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:23.067 region:rollup2

BREACH RESPONSE REPORT. IN AT

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:25.670 region:rollup2
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL USED ITS

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:26.971 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT POWER TO PICK A SET

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.539 region:rollup2
OF STANDARDS AND SEE THAT

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:30.341 region:rollup2
ANYTHING LESS THAN THE STANDARDS

00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:31.676 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DEEMED UNREASONABLE. A

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:32.877 region:rollup2
THIS SORT OF INFLEXIBLE

00:43:31.676 --> 00:43:33.744 region:rollup2
ARBITRARY STANDARD SETTING

00:43:32.877 --> 00:43:35.213 region:rollup2
WITHOUT DELIBERATE OF

LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OR PUBLIC

00:43:35.213 --> 00:43:37.982 region:rollup2
NOTICE AND COMMENT IS SOMETHING

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.617 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYONE AGREES IS THE

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:40.785 region:rollup2
WRONG WAY TO GO HOWEVER AB

00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:42.086 region:rollup2
NINETEEN OH SIX AS CURRENTLY

00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:43.087 region:rollup2
WRITTEN CREATES A PARALLEL

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:45.056 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE THAT'LL GET US HERE

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:45.256 region:rollup2
FIVE. SEVEN TEN YEARS DOWN THE

ROAD.

00:43:45.256 --> 00:43:49.460 region:rollup2
SO ARMAMENT IS A COMPROMISE.

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:50.728 region:rollup2
THAT GETS US CLOSE TO SOLVING

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.063 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM WE LEAVE THE

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:52.997 region:rollup2
REASONABLENESS FRAMEWORK AS IT'S

00:43:52.063 --> 00:43:54.765 region:rollup2
WRITTEN INTACT

MANUFACTURERS.

00:43:56.968 --> 00:44:00.037 region:rollup2
THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:01.439 region:rollup2
DID WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:03.341 region:rollup2
DO THAT THEY HAVE.

CERTAINLY FOR THE AUTHOR THIS

00:44:58.763 --> 00:45:01.666 region:rollup2
POINT OF THE DEFINITION OF

00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:03.634 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURE IN THE CONCEPT THAT.

00:45:01.666 --> 00:45:04.835 region:rollup2
AN OEM.

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:06.971 region:rollup2
COULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:08.506 region:rollup2
THAN IF YOU MAY HAVE YOUR

00:45:06.971 --> 00:45:10.274 region:rollup2
REFRIGERATOR THAT CAN CONNECT TO

00:45:08.506 --> 00:45:12.109 region:rollup2
THE INTERNET MADE. IN ANOTHER

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:14.045 region:rollup2
COUNTRY AND THEN BRANDED AND

INTENTION OF AND AND SO THIS IS

00:45:19.317 --> 00:45:22.587 region:rollup2
A MATTER OF. DIFFERENT

00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:23.854 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF HEALTH THE

00:45:22.587 --> 00:45:25.189 region:rollup2
WORDING IS AND WE HAVE EVERY

INTENTION TO.

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:30.428 region:rollup2
TIGHTEN THAT UP UNTIL AND AND

00:45:27.792 --> 00:45:30.928 region:rollup2
AND. YOU KNOW TO MAKE CERTAIN

00:45:30.428 --> 00:45:32.396 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:33.798 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE WOULD

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:35.766 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IN THE ANALYSIS IT

00:45:33.798 --> 00:45:37.969 region:rollup2

DISCUSSION AND CONVERSATIONS TO

00:45:40.638 --> 00:45:43.674 region:rollup2
SEE WHAT ELSE CAN BE DONE TO

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.976 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THERE ISN'T THAT

00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:45.643 region:rollup2
WHAT. SOUNDS LIKE A GAPING

00:45:44.976 --> 00:45:47.278 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BUT IT COULD PROBABLY BE

00:45:45.643 --> 00:45:50.081 region:rollup2
FAXED.

00:45:47.278 --> 00:45:51.515 region:rollup2
M.. SECONDLY IS OFTEN WHEN YOU

00:45:50.081 --> 00:45:53.384 region:rollup2
SEE A REASONABLENESS STANDARD AN

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:55.953 region:rollup2
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.

00:45:53.384 --> 00:45:58.623 region:rollup2
YOU DO YOU WANT TO PUT INTO LAW

00:45:55.953 --> 00:46:01.092 region:rollup2
AYE FLEXIBILITY.

00:45:58.623 --> 00:46:02.193 region:rollup2
BUT THE THE PRACTICALITY OF WHAT

00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:03.728 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE HAS A

00:46:02.193 --> 00:46:05.930 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT THEY CAN THEN SUE A

00:46:03.728 --> 00:46:06.831 region:rollup2
COMPANY FOR TO AND THEN TEST IF

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:08.065 region:rollup2
IT'S A REASONABLE IT'S A

00:46:06.831 --> 00:46:09.967 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF FACT THAT GOES

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:11.435 region:rollup2
BEFORE A JUDGE OR A JURY. WHICH

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:12.737 region:rollup2
IS POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:13.504 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS INTO A

00:46:12.737 --> 00:46:15.273 region:rollup2
COURT PROCESS EVEN AN

OUT OF COURT.

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:22.680 region:rollup2
SO I'M THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT THE

00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:23.814 region:rollup2
SAFE HARBOR MIGHT BE A GOOD WAY

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.683 region:rollup2
TO GO BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN

00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:27.084 region:rollup2
HELP US.

00:46:25.683 --> 00:46:29.420 region:rollup2
AT LEAST GIVE SOME AREAS WHERE

00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:31.656 region:rollup2

FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND THAT AT

00:46:34.292 --> 00:46:37.762 region:rollup2
TRIAL.

00:46:35.293 --> 00:46:39.697 region:rollup2
THAT IT AND THAT CYBER COST TO

00:46:37.762 --> 00:46:41.132 region:rollup2
GO TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S BEEN

00:46:39.697 --> 00:46:42.400 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE ACTIONS TAKEN.

00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:44.635 region:rollup2
THE FLIP SIDE THE SAFE HARBOR

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.071 region:rollup2
CAN ALSO BE TO.

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:47.905 region:rollup2
EITHER DAVID OR INFLEXIBLE SO

00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:50.608 region:rollup2

00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:51.075 region:rollup2
HARBOR. AND MY CONCERN JUST SEEN

YOUR INTEREST IN MAKING THIS A

00:46:58.182 --> 00:47:01.485 region:rollup2
SAFE HARBOR MORE FLEXIBLE OR AT

00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:02.753 region:rollup2

APPLIES IN THAT'S EXTREMELY

00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:13.497 region:rollup2

A SO ON A SAFE HARBOR ISSUE.

00:47:22.907 --> 00:47:26.177 region:rollup2
THERE WAS SOME CONSENSUS

BETWEEN US AND.

00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:29.547 region:rollup2

MAKE THAT. A NOT BE THE CASE

00:47:34.752 --> 00:47:38.356 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT

00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:39.890 region:rollup2
WAS ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND

00:47:38.356 --> 00:47:40.758 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE NOT LOCKED INTO.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.927 region:rollup2
FORCING.

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:49.333 region:rollup2
MANY OF MORE ADVANCED METHODS

IF WE RAN THIS BY.

00:47:50.935 --> 00:47:55.706 region:rollup2
MANY MANY COMPANIES TO MAKE

00:47:53.471 --> 00:47:57.108 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THAT WE WERE FLEXIBLE

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:57.808 region:rollup2
ENOUGH.

00:47:57.108 --> 00:48:00.511 region:rollup2
IN.

00:47:57.808 --> 00:48:02.780 region:rollup2
IN IN THAT AREA AND.

00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:03.948 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS A REASONABLE THE

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.783 region:rollup2
REASONABLE STANDARD GET THE

00:48:03.948 --> 00:48:08.452 region:rollup2
STANDARD REASONABLE NO STANDARD

00:48:05.783 --> 00:48:08.652 region:rollup2
WE DID USE THAT TO MAKE SURE

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:09.520 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:12.656 region:rollup2
.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.290 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WE HAD FLEXIBILITY AND

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:15.392 region:rollup2
SO.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:17.261 region:rollup2
WHILE IT DOES CARRY WITH IT

00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:19.196 region:rollup2
CERTAIN UNCERTAINTY IT IT'S THE

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:21.098 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY THAT ALLOWS US TO

00:48:19.196 --> 00:48:22.733 region:rollup2
EMBRACE INNOVATION AND NEW

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:23.534 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY DOWN THE ROAD AND. WE

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:25.169 region:rollup2
THINK A COMPANY SHOULD BE

00:48:23.534 --> 00:48:27.104 region:rollup2
EXPLAINED ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO ITS

00:48:25.169 --> 00:48:28.839 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS WHY IT'S CHOICES

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:31.275 region:rollup2
RELATED TO SECURITY ARE

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:32.610 region:rollup2
REASONABLE. AND APPROPRIATE TO

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:34.145 region:rollup2
THE DEVICE AT THEY ARE SELLING

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:35.379 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT IS FAIR FOR A

00:48:34.145 --> 00:48:37.448 region:rollup2
COMPANY TO EXPLAIN TO ITS

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:39.283 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS ULTIMATELY IF THERE SU

00:48:37.448 --> 00:48:40.985 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO.

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:42.920 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE.

00:48:40.985 --> 00:48:44.488 region:rollup2
AND AND LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.656 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS LATER YOU

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:46.657 region:rollup2
MIGHT GET A DETERMINATION OF

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:49.193 region:rollup2
THAT EITHER IN THE FORM OF A

00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:51.128 region:rollup2
SETTLER CASE AYE. I THINK M. AYE

00:48:49.193 --> 00:48:52.863 region:rollup2
IF IF I COULD.

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:54.632 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT I'D OFFER TWO CENTS ON

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:55.833 region:rollup2
THIS PART IS.

00:48:54.632 --> 00:48:57.735 region:rollup2
AT A CERTAINLY A SAFE HARBOR

00:48:55.833 --> 00:48:59.737 region:rollup2
THAT'S FLEXIBLE BUT THAT DOESN'T

00:48:57.735 --> 00:49:01.839 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY MEAN ANOTHER PATH IT

00:48:59.737 --> 00:49:03.174 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE LITIGATED. TWO THREE

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:06.110 region:rollup2
YEARS THROUGH COURT THAT IS VERY

00:49:03.174 --> 00:49:06.877 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE AND AND THE SAFE

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:09.146 region:rollup2
HARBOR THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY.

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:11.515 region:rollup2
.

00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:12.082 region:rollup2
HELPFUL SO THAT GOOD ACTORS

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:13.751 region:rollup2
REALLY DO HAVE A SAFE HARBOR

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:15.286 region:rollup2
AND.

00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:16.454 region:rollup2
AYE ABSURDLY SUPPORTING THIS

00:49:15.286 --> 00:49:18.055 region:rollup2
TODAY I JUST DO HAVE THAT

00:49:16.454 --> 00:49:19.023 region:rollup2
CONCERN ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:20.925 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURE YOU VERY ADDRESS

00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:21.459 region:rollup2
THAT. AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:49:20.925 --> 00:49:23.427 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT.

00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:24.962 region:rollup2
CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:49:23.427 --> 00:49:26.297 region:rollup2
THIS REALLY TO NOT BE RESOLVED

00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:27.965 region:rollup2
UNTIL VERY LATE IN THE TRIAL

00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:30.301 region:rollup2
PROCESS IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE

00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:32.069 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND I. LATELY AGREE

00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:33.137 region:rollup2
WITH YOUR CONCERNS AND WE WILL

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:34.438 region:rollup2
AND DEFINITELY KEEP WORKING.

00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:35.973 region:rollup2
.

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:39.543 region:rollup2
WITH THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:40.010 region:rollup2
TO MINIMIZE THAT POSSIBILITY.

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:41.545 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:43.714 region:rollup2
OBERNOLTE.

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:45.349 region:rollup2
I WOULD ECHO THEIR CONCERNS BY

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:47.485 region:rollup2
REYES BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN BAKER UP

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:48.452 region:rollup2
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BY THE WAY.

00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:49.687 region:rollup2
WELL.

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:51.822 region:rollup2
YOU SINGING BUT YOU KNOW MY

00:49:49.687 --> 00:49:53.157 region:rollup2
CONCERNS REALLY IT IS SOMEONE

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:54.492 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S BEEN IN THE.

00:49:53.157 --> 00:49:56.327 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY.

00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:57.895 region:rollup2
MY CONCERNS REVOLVE AROUND THE

00:49:56.327 --> 00:49:59.063 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF REASONABLE AND

00:49:57.895 --> 00:50:00.631 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GONE OUT OF YOUR WAY IN

00:49:59.063 --> 00:50:01.832 region:rollup2
THE RECITALS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

00:50:00.631 --> 00:50:02.867 region:rollup2
AUTHENTICATION MEANS WHAT A

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:04.235 region:rollup2
CONNECTED DEVICE IS WHAT A

00:50:02.867 --> 00:50:05.536 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING IS. WHAT A

00:50:04.235 --> 00:50:06.804 region:rollup2
SECURITY FEATURE IS AND I REALLY

00:50:05.536 --> 00:50:08.339 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT'S MISSING A

00:50:06.804 --> 00:50:10.107 region:rollup2
SECTION THAT DEFINES WHAT

00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:11.809 region:rollup2
REASONABLE IS BECAUSE THE LAST

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:13.410 region:rollup2
THING WE WANT TO DO? IS PUT A

00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:14.578 region:rollup2
WORD WITH NO TECHNICAL MEETING

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:16.380 region:rollup2
IN THERE AND LEAVE IT UP TO

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:17.448 region:rollup2
ROOMS FULL OF LAWYERS ARGUE

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.482 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT'S REASONABLE MUST NOT

00:50:17.448 --> 00:50:20.117 region:rollup2
RUN REASONABLE SO.

00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:22.419 region:rollup2
THESE SOLUTIONS THAT WAS

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:23.420 region:rollup2
OFFERED BY THE OPPOSITION I

00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:24.455 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.556 region:rollup2
NO MIGHT SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM

00:50:24.455 --> 00:50:27.324 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ENCOURAGE USE THE BILL

00:50:25.556 --> 00:50:29.894 region:rollup2
MOVES FORWARD HERE TO TO MAYBE

00:50:27.324 --> 00:50:31.395 region:rollup2
CONSIDER PUTTING THAT ON.

00:50:29.894 --> 00:50:35.199 region:rollup2
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:37.201 region:rollup2
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS.

00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:38.636 region:rollup2
SO FIGURE MUCH MISS MULLIN.

00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:39.770 region:rollup2
THINKING WE SHARED FAME IS

00:50:38.636 --> 00:50:42.006 region:rollup2
OFFERING THE BILL I JUMPED INTO

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:43.674 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION MIDSTREAM HERE.

00:50:42.006 --> 00:50:45.075 region:rollup2
I DID WE RESOLVE THE ISSUE

00:50:43.674 --> 00:50:46.911 region:rollup2
AROUND DEFINITIONS.

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:48.045 region:rollup2
OF MANUFACTURE MY CONCERN IS

00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:48.679 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMPETITIVE

00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:50.447 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGE FOR CALIFORNIA HAVE

00:50:48.679 --> 00:50:53.384 region:rollup2
WE.

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:55.419 region:rollup2
UNRESOLVED THAT IF. WE AND OUR

00:50:53.384 --> 00:50:57.154 region:rollup2
HAVE EVERY INTENTION OF MAKING

00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:59.290 region:rollup2
SURE THE BILL DOES WHAT IT WAS

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:59.623 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO DO IT WAS NEVER TO

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:00.958 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGE.

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:03.360 region:rollup2
.

00:51:00.958 --> 00:51:04.395 region:rollup2
CERTAIN COMPANIES AND SO WHAT WE

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.196 region:rollup2
ARE AND WE NEED TO JUST TAKE

00:51:04.395 --> 00:51:06.397 region:rollup2
ANOTHER LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AND

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:08.165 region:rollup2
AND.

00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:09.300 region:rollup2
TIGHTEN IT UP BUT THAT IS NOT

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:11.001 region:rollup2
THE INTENT.

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.536 region:rollup2
BUT I'D FIGURED IT PROBABLY WAS

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:13.737 region:rollup2
AND JUST WANT TO CLARIFY GOING

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:16.407 region:rollup2
FOR YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIX

00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:19.310 region:rollup2
THAT DEFINITION.

00:51:16.407 --> 00:51:20.277 region:rollup2
MISTER KILEY CUT.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:21.245 region:rollup2
I JUST TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:23.113 region:rollup2
STEP BACK.

00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:25.082 region:rollup2
IN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT. HOW

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:26.750 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD WORK IF IT WERE

00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:29.086 region:rollup2
TO BECOME LAW?

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:32.056 region:rollup2
IS IT YOUR INTENT TO I CREATE A

00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:32.823 region:rollup2
NEW LEGAL DUTY THAT DOESN'T

00:51:32.056 --> 00:51:36.160 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY EXIST.

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:38.963 region:rollup2
FOR THESE MANUFACTURERS.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:40.564 region:rollup2
A NEW LEGAL DUTY.

00:51:38.963 --> 00:51:40.864 region:rollup2
THAT'S RIGHT THAT ARE AS I. YOU

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:43.601 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

00:51:40.864 --> 00:51:45.102 region:rollup2
TO THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE TO

00:51:43.601 --> 00:51:46.937 region:rollup2
AYE APPROACH SECURITY FEATURES.

00:51:45.102 --> 00:51:49.506 region:rollup2
THIS IS.

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:51.442 region:rollup2
REQUIRING DEVICE MANUFACTURERS

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:53.677 region:rollup2
TO HAVE SOME SORT OF REASONABLE

00:51:51.442 --> 00:51:57.247 region:rollup2
SECURITY ON THEIR DEVICES SO

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:58.549 region:rollup2
THAT THEY. ARE I MEAN. THAT AS I

00:51:57.247 --> 00:52:01.085 region:rollup2
MENTION BEFORE WITH THE BIG.

00:51:58.549 --> 00:52:02.519 region:rollup2
BOTNET ATTACK THAT WE HAD.

00:52:01.085 --> 00:52:03.854 region:rollup2
.

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:05.356 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IT'S TO

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:07.157 region:rollup2
PREVENT THOSE TYPE OF THINGS

00:52:05.356 --> 00:52:08.826 region:rollup2
FROM HAPPENING AND AND ALSO.

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:10.160 region:rollup2
NO PRIVACY PRINT PROTECTION IT'S

00:52:08.826 --> 00:52:12.730 region:rollup2
NOT JUST ABOUT THESE DEVICES

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.965 region:rollup2
BEING USED HARNESSED TOGETHER.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:16.567 region:rollup2
TO OVERWHELM AND BRING DOWN THE

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:17.635 region:rollup2
INTERNET BUT IT'S ALSO MAKING

00:52:16.567 --> 00:52:19.303 region:rollup2
SURE THAT.

00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:21.872 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS.

00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:23.707 region:rollup2
ARE NOT EASILY HACKED INTO SO

00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:25.409 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE CAMERAS ON YOUR

00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:27.277 region:rollup2
COMPUTERS OR YOU HAVE THE RING

00:52:25.409 --> 00:52:28.379 region:rollup2
DOORBELL JUST MAKING SURE THAT

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:29.847 region:rollup2
THOSE DEVICES ARE NOT HACKED

00:52:28.379 --> 00:52:32.449 region:rollup2
INTO.THERE IS NO.

00:52:29.847 --> 00:52:34.151 region:rollup2
IT IN GENERAL THERE'S NO

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:36.286 region:rollup2
MINIMAL SECURITY LEVEL NOW WE

00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:38.589 region:rollup2
DID HAVE THE MEDICAL DEVICE

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:39.089 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS UP AND AND THEY

00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:42.159 region:rollup2
WERE.

00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:43.894 region:rollup2
NEUTRAL ON THE BILL AND IF YOU

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:46.296 region:rollup2
HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT ALREADY

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:47.831 region:rollup2
HAS FEDERAL STANDARDS.

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:50.067 region:rollup2
THEN THEY CAN ABIDE BY THOSE

00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:51.101 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF ABIDING BY THAT

00:52:50.067 --> 00:52:53.804 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STANDARD BUT WORK

00:52:51.101 --> 00:52:57.107 region:rollup2
FILLING IN WHAT RITE NOW IS A

00:52:53.804 --> 00:52:59.009 region:rollup2
GAPING HOLE.

00:52:57.107 --> 00:53:00.110 region:rollup2
I I GUESS MY QUESTION IS YOU

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:01.612 region:rollup2
KNOW WE ALL HAVE AT EVERY

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:02.880 region:rollup2
COMPANY HAS A DUTY I NOT TO

00:53:01.612 --> 00:53:05.716 region:rollup2
CAUSE HARM TO OTHERS THROUGH.

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:08.585 region:rollup2
UNREASONABLE CONDUCT AND SO.

00:53:05.716 --> 00:53:10.688 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THIS LANGUAGE ADDING TE?

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:12.689 region:rollup2
THAT EXISTING LEGAL DUTY JUST

00:53:10.688 --> 00:53:13.957 region:rollup2
KIND OF SAYING THAT.

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:15.526 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE A STANDARD NOW

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:16.860 region:rollup2
EXIST SPECIFICALLY I WITH

00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:19.296 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO SECURITY FEATURES

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:21.065 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR CONNECTED DEVICES.

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:22.666 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THIS ADDING WILL THIS IS

00:53:21.065 --> 00:53:24.401 region:rollup2
ADDING IT IS ADDING THAT

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:25.903 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT OBVIOUSLY WHAT IS

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:27.438 region:rollup2
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS

00:53:25.903 --> 00:53:29.606 region:rollup2
ALLOWING COMPANIES TO BE

00:53:27.438 --> 00:53:31.175 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY SELF REGULATING ISN'T

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:33.010 region:rollup2
WORKING SO THERE DOES HAVE TO BE

00:53:31.175 --> 00:53:36.246 region:rollup2
SOME? MINIMAL LEVEL OF

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:38.716 region:rollup2
REGULATION.

00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:40.718 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT I MEAN THAT YOU KNOW.

00:53:38.716 --> 00:53:42.252 region:rollup2
A COMPANY CAN BE SUED AS IS.

00:53:40.718 --> 00:53:44.288 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOR.

00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:46.356 region:rollup2
THE A IN CONDUCT THAT CAUSES

00:53:44.288 --> 00:53:47.858 region:rollup2
HARM TO CONSUMERS OR TO ANYONE

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:49.026 region:rollup2
I'VE SHOWN THAT CONDUCT IS

00:53:47.858 --> 00:53:49.593 region:rollup2
UNREASONABLE AND I THINK WHAT

00:53:49.026 --> 00:53:50.627 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING IS

00:53:49.593 --> 00:53:51.428 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:54.731 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALREADY.

00:53:51.428 --> 00:53:57.167 region:rollup2
AN EXISTING DUTY OUTLAW I TO

00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:59.336 region:rollup2
HIGH TO BE REASONABLE.

00:53:57.167 --> 00:54:00.471 region:rollup2
AND SO IF WE WANT TO GIVE THAT

00:53:59.336 --> 00:54:02.239 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR CONTENT.

00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:03.474 region:rollup2
THEN YOU KNOW THAT THE

00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:05.175 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES OF STANDARD SETTING

00:54:03.474 --> 00:54:06.443 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS MIGHT BE A BETTER

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:07.344 region:rollup2
WAY TO GO RATHER THAN SORT OF

00:54:06.443 --> 00:54:08.479 region:rollup2
OPENING A NEW.

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:11.515 region:rollup2
FRONTS.

00:54:08.479 --> 00:54:13.217 region:rollup2
WHAT IS IT IS NOT REASONABLE IN

00:54:11.515 --> 00:54:14.184 region:rollup2
STATUTE THAT WITH THEM LIKELY BL

00:54:13.217 --> 00:54:15.519 region:rollup2
ELABORATED?

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:16.987 region:rollup2
THROUGH FOR THE REGULATIONS SO

00:54:15.519 --> 00:54:19.256 region:rollup2
WHY WHY IS THIS APPROACH

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:20.124 region:rollup2
SUPERIOR TO THE ONE THAT THEY'RE

00:54:19.256 --> 00:54:22.226 region:rollup2
PROPOSING.

00:54:20.124 --> 00:54:25.729 region:rollup2
AND.

00:54:22.226 --> 00:54:28.332 region:rollup2
THE IF THEY WOULD PREFER TO USE

00:54:25.729 --> 00:54:30.134 region:rollup2
OF FEDERAL STANDARDS AND THEY

00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:31.668 region:rollup2
HAVE THEIR ORGANIZATION AND MAKE

00:54:30.134 --> 00:54:33.704 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THAT YOU KNOW THEY

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:35.072 region:rollup2
WORK WITH NEST AND COME UP WITH

00:54:33.704 --> 00:54:37.374 region:rollup2
FEDERAL STANDARDS AND THEY CAN

00:54:35.072 --> 00:54:39.576 region:rollup2
BE. REGULATED.

00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:41.211 region:rollup2
BY THE FEDS BUT RIGHT NOW.

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:43.714 region:rollup2
MOST DEVICES DO NOT HAVE FEDERAL

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:44.615 region:rollup2
STANDARDS.

00:54:43.714 --> 00:54:45.949 region:rollup2
BUT DOES THE OPPOSITION JUST

00:54:44.615 --> 00:54:48.152 region:rollup2
WANNA WAY ON THIS WITH RESPECT

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:48.752 region:rollup2
TO THE ROLE THAT ASK INDUSTRY

00:54:48.152 --> 00:54:50.454 region:rollup2
STANDARD SETTING ORGANIZATIONS

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:52.923 region:rollup2
COMPLY.

00:54:50.454 --> 00:54:54.324 region:rollup2
SO STANDARDS AND MAYBE IT'S

00:54:52.923 --> 00:54:56.260 region:rollup2
TERMINOLOGY CONFUSION BUT.

00:54:54.324 --> 00:54:58.295 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS VERSUS STANDARD

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:59.630 region:rollup2
STANDARDS YOU WELL AS A EXAMPLE

00:54:58.295 --> 00:55:01.231 region:rollup2
OF MANY STANDARD TODAY YOU

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.900 region:rollup2
SAFETY STANDARDS AND ON BACK OF

00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:04.201 region:rollup2
MOST COMPUTERS AND EVERYTHING

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:06.803 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE THAT SO COMPANIES.

00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:08.605 region:rollup2
PUT THE UL STANDARD ON THERE AS

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:10.440 region:rollup2
A MATT MARKET REALITY. AND THAT

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:12.209 region:rollup2
STANDARD ORGANIZATION DOES THESE

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:14.745 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUALLY IS CHANGES AS

00:55:12.209 --> 00:55:16.046 region:rollup2
SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS CHANGE AND

00:55:14.745 --> 00:55:18.048 region:rollup2
GET IMPROVED AND IT'S AN ONGOING

00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:19.650 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT TYPE OF STANDARD

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:21.652 region:rollup2
PROCESS THERE'S A U. S. STANDARD

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:23.353 region:rollup2
FOR SECURITY. THERE'S A NEST

00:55:21.652 --> 00:55:24.621 region:rollup2
PROCESS GOING ON RIGHT NOW FOR

00:55:23.353 --> 00:55:27.057 region:rollup2
PRESS WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:29.059 region:rollup2
STANDARDS PROCESS NOT OF SELF

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:30.627 region:rollup2
REGULATED. NOT OUT SOMETHING

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:31.995 region:rollup2
FROM THE CUSTOMS BORDER PATROL

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:34.665 region:rollup2
OR HOMELAND SECURITY IT'S A

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:35.232 region:rollup2
STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

00:55:34.665 --> 00:55:35.999 region:rollup2
THAT IS USED THROUGHOUT THE

00:55:35.232 --> 00:55:37.901 region:rollup2
WORLD.

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:39.870 region:rollup2
FOR THIS KIND OF EFFORT TO

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:41.438 region:rollup2
BECAUSE LAWS TAKE TOO LONG FOR

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:42.573 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE FOR TECHNOLOGY SO

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:44.174 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS

00:55:42.573 --> 00:55:46.243 region:rollup2
A STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:47.945 region:rollup2
ALREADY. EXISTS AND THAT IT

00:55:46.243 --> 00:55:49.346 region:rollup2
COULD EVEN BE INTERNATIONALIZE

00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:51.148 region:rollup2
SEE AND YOU REALLY A BROADER

00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:52.950 region:rollup2
CONTROL BUT DOING STATE BY STATE

00:55:51.148 --> 00:55:54.818 region:rollup2
PATCHWORK OF LAWS TO CREATE

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:56.620 region:rollup2
LITIGATION VULNERABILITIES AND

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:58.422 region:rollup2
ARE TOO SLOW TO REACT.

00:55:56.620 --> 00:56:01.992 region:rollup2
IN OUR VIEW IS NOT THE IS NOT

00:55:58.422 --> 00:56:02.626 region:rollup2
THE BEST WAY TO DEAL PROTECTION.

00:56:01.992 --> 00:56:04.328 region:rollup2
JUST ONE MORE A QUESTION FROM

00:56:02.626 --> 00:56:05.829 region:rollup2
ISRAEL AND I SEE THERE'S NO NEW

00:56:04.328 --> 00:56:06.763 region:rollup2
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH I

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:08.265 region:rollup2
I'M I'M HAPPY ABOUT.

00:56:06.763 --> 00:56:09.499 region:rollup2
I SEE THERE'S NO NEW PRIVATE

00:56:08.265 --> 00:56:10.033 region:rollup2
RIGHT OF ACTION HERE WHICH I'M

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:11.702 region:rollup2
HAPPY ABOUT.

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:13.570 region:rollup2
THERE WAS SOME MENTION OF MAYBE

00:56:11.702 --> 00:56:15.239 region:rollup2
THE AG WILL HAVE SOME

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:16.340 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY HERE I DO

00:56:15.239 --> 00:56:17.674 region:rollup2
YOU THINK THAT'S THE CASE OR DO

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:19.209 region:rollup2
YOU SEE ANY OTHER ENFORCEMENT

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:20.777 region:rollup2
MECHANISM. BUT THERE IS NO

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:22.312 region:rollup2
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND YES

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:25.849 region:rollup2
THE AGE YOU MIGHT HAVE AN

00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:31.221 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT BACK.

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:32.689 region:rollup2
AND WHAT.

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:33.757 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WHAT OUT OF FORT SMITH

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:36.693 region:rollup2
ALREADY ENTAIL.

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:38.562 region:rollup2
I WAS JUST INFORMED THAT IT WAS

00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:39.263 region:rollup2
BNP CODE.

00:56:38.562 --> 00:56:46.536 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

00:56:39.263 --> 00:56:52.676 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED.

00:56:46.536 --> 00:56:53.243 region:rollup2
I'M NOT A LAWYER.

00:56:52.676 --> 00:56:55.178 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE

00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:56.480 region:rollup2
ELECTORATE CHIME IN HERE ALSO I

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:58.282 region:rollup2
I PRESUME THAT MANY MANY OF THE

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.849 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS OUT THERE ARE

00:56:58.282 --> 00:57:00.884 region:rollup2
ALREADY PROVIDING SECURITY

00:56:58.849 --> 00:57:02.085 region:rollup2
MEASURES. WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:03.787 region:rollup2
AT ALL I THINK WITH THIS BILL

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:06.189 region:rollup2
WILL DO IS ESSENTIALLY SET A

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:07.224 region:rollup2
BASELINE UPON WHICH DAY BUILT ON

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:09.126 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU CALL THOSE TWO

00:57:07.224 --> 00:57:10.627 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS SAFE HARBORS OR. A

00:57:09.126 --> 00:57:11.828 region:rollup2
LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR

00:57:10.627 --> 00:57:13.463 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE I THINK

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:15.098 region:rollup2
THAT BASICALLY SUCH A BASELINE

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:17.234 region:rollup2
FOR ALL. ON YOU KNOW

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:19.102 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURES TO COMPLY WITH AND

00:57:17.234 --> 00:57:20.370 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW TO ME

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:21.939 region:rollup2
IT THIS IS A VERY IS GREAT

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:23.006 region:rollup2
CONCEPT I THINK. YOU KNOW

00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:25.008 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE A

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:26.977 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK FOR ALL THESE AYE I'LL

00:57:25.008 --> 00:57:29.479 region:rollup2
TWO DEVICES TO TO BAIT BASICALLY

00:57:26.977 --> 00:57:31.248 region:rollup2
ABIDE BY OUR BECAUSE WE AS YOU

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:32.716 region:rollup2
MENTIONED WE GONNA SEE BILLIONS

00:57:31.248 --> 00:57:33.784 region:rollup2
OR MAYBE EVEN TRILLIONS OF

00:57:32.716 --> 00:57:36.320 region:rollup2
SENSORS AND. AND.

00:57:33.784 --> 00:57:38.388 region:rollup2
DEVICES TO BE CONNECTED TO THE

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.957 region:rollup2
THE I TT I'LL TEACH. YOU KNOW

00:57:38.388 --> 00:57:41.725 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SOME KIND OF OUR.

00:57:39.957 --> 00:57:43.393 region:rollup2
PROTECTION ON YOU KNOW

00:57:41.725 --> 00:57:45.162 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY COULD POTENTIALLY A

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:47.064 region:rollup2
RISKS ARE YOU KNOW SECURITY AND

00:57:45.162 --> 00:57:50.834 region:rollup2
I THINK IT THE BILL ALSO IS IN

00:57:47.064 --> 00:57:51.535 region:rollup2
LINE WITH WHAT WE CALL USUALLY.

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:52.970 region:rollup2
.

00:57:51.535 --> 00:57:54.604 region:rollup2
PRIVACY BY DESIGN AND ALSO

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:56.406 region:rollup2
SECURITY BY DESIGN THE MEETING

00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:57.808 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW FROM THE GET GO

00:57:56.406 --> 00:57:59.276 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURE WOULD INCORPORATE

00:57:57.808 --> 00:57:59.810 region:rollup2
ALL THE SUDDEN ARE YOU KNOW

00:57:59.276 --> 00:58:01.378 region:rollup2
CONCEPTS INTO THE PRODUCT

00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:02.079 region:rollup2
ITSELF.

00:58:01.378 --> 00:58:04.281 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY WILL BE IN

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:06.083 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW SO I

00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:08.151 region:rollup2
THINK I THINK THIS WILL HOW FAR

00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:10.053 region:rollup2
FAR REACHING RAMIFICATIONS. ARE

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:11.922 region:rollup2
IF WE PROVIDE THE YOU KNOW A

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:13.056 region:rollup2
SOLID FOUNDATION FOR IT ON IT

00:58:11.922 --> 00:58:14.925 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN MENTION ABOUT

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:16.927 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO CONDITIONS OR. AS SOME

00:58:14.925 --> 00:58:18.862 region:rollup2
HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE SAFE

00:58:16.927 --> 00:58:20.797 region:rollup2
HARBORS AND I THINK WE PROBABLY

00:58:18.862 --> 00:58:22.366 region:rollup2
NEED IN THE FUTURE TO. ARE YOU

00:58:20.797 --> 00:58:24.267 region:rollup2
TO UPDATE THOSE UP.

00:58:22.366 --> 00:58:26.036 region:rollup2
OR MEET THOSE A LITTLE BIT

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:28.171 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DON'T BECAUSE AS YOU

00:58:26.036 --> 00:58:30.340 region:rollup2
MENTION SOMEONE MENTIONED THAT.

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:31.808 region:rollup2
THE CYBER ALL CRIMINALS ARE

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:33.477 region:rollup2
GONNA HOUSE MARGO'S IN THE UNIT

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:35.512 region:rollup2
JUST TO GET AHEAD OF US SO WE

00:58:33.477 --> 00:58:37.114 region:rollup2
NEED TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE THE TO

00:58:35.512 --> 00:58:38.682 region:rollup2
THE SAFE HARBOR OR THAT. THE

00:58:37.114 --> 00:58:41.184 region:rollup2
LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR.

00:58:38.682 --> 00:58:42.486 region:rollup2
IN THAT REQUIRED SO I'M SIT

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:43.653 region:rollup2
STILL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I

00:58:42.486 --> 00:58:45.355 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT WOULD ADVISE THAT

00:58:43.653 --> 00:58:46.289 region:rollup2
YOU DO YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:47.891 region:rollup2
BUT I I THINK THAT.

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:50.894 region:rollup2
THE BILL DOES PROVIDE THAT KIND

00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:52.295 region:rollup2
OF A BASS LINE OR THRESHOLD FOR.

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:53.730 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURES TO COMPLY WITH.

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:57.334 region:rollup2
AND I DO WANT TO MAKE ONE

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:57.834 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION IF THERE ARE NO

00:58:57.334 --> 00:58:58.101 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:59.102 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

00:58:58.101 --> 00:59:01.905 region:rollup2
AB THE OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:03.673 region:rollup2
PASS ON THE OF AMENDMENTS

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:04.941 region:rollup2
REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS ARE

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:05.475 region:rollup2
AND I HEARD YOU MENTION THAT

00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:07.277 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:09.413 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENT

00:59:07.277 --> 00:59:10.680 region:rollup2
TO THE DELAY IMPLEMENTATION BY

00:59:09.413 --> 00:59:11.915 region:rollup2
ONE YEAR SO WHAT WOULD YOU

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:14.051 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THAT TO BE PART OF THE

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:15.719 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT AS WELL IF WE CAN DO

00:59:14.051 --> 00:59:17.687 region:rollup2
THAT RIGHT NOW CERTAINLY. OKAY

00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:18.288 region:rollup2
SO YOU JUST GO FOR THE RECORD

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:19.990 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

THE WORD BOUGHT.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:45.542 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:47.777 region:rollup2
DEFINITION IS SO BROAD THAT.

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:48.878 region:rollup2
MOST.

COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DOES POINT

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:29.719 region:rollup2

POLICY THAT WORKS. OUT TO LAND

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:17.500 region:rollup2

WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:29.412 region:rollup2
BILL WAS ALSO ASSIGNED TO BUT

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:30.947 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:33.182 region:rollup2
WE WOULD HAVE TIME TO GO TO

01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:34.984 region:rollup2
BOTH COMMITTEES WE WORKED WITH.

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:36.019 region:rollup2

THAT WE COULD.

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:50.500 region:rollup2
FURTHER DEFINED THIS BUT I

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:52.635 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT COMMITMENT

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:54.337 region:rollup2
DOESN'T AND WITH PASSAGE TODAY

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:56.806 region:rollup2

RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. WITH YOUR

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.785 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF THE BILL

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:10.486 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'D KNOW WHERE IN THE

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:11.821 region:rollup2
BILL TO SAY THAT THE BOT HAS TO

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:13.590 region:rollup2
COLLECT THE. PERSONAL

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:15.959 region:rollup2

HAVING TO HAVE THIS DISCLOSURE

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:23.900 region:rollup2
AND SO MY READING OF THE BILL

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:25.902 region:rollup2

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:29.005 region:rollup2
AND SO I I REALLY THINK THAT

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:30.773 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:08:29.005 --> 01:08:32.475 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO SPEND SOME MORE TIME

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.942 region:rollup2

RESOURCE RATHER RISE BUT THAT IS

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:09.946 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT THE DEFINITION GOES

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:12.215 region:rollup2

MOST AUTOMATED.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:16.519 region:rollup2
EASIEST COMMUNICATIONS WE WOULD

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:38.107 region:rollup2
IF IT'LL BE REALLY ESSENTIAL I

01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:39.642 region:rollup2
WOULD THINK TO GET THIS.

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:41.444 region:rollup2
TO GO AFTER THE NEFARIOUS USE

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:41.978 region:rollup2
YES

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:44.881 region:rollup2

THAT WILL HAPPEN.

01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:58.227 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:06.936 region:rollup2
NOT TO TOUCH

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:08.237 region:rollup2
TO MAKE IT SO RIGID THAT TWO

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:09.439 region:rollup2
YEARS FROM NOW SOME OTHER

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:10.373 region:rollup2
TERMINOLOGY OR SOME OTHER

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:11.841 region:rollup2

YEAH EXACTLY BICU THE.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:26.522 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE WERE VERY

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:30.226 region:rollup2
CAREFUL IN THE ORIGINAL BILL.

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:33.096 region:rollup2
NOT TO BAN THE USE OF POTS.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:34.664 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS STILL HERE WE WE

01:10:33.096 --> 01:10:37.033 region:rollup2
DON'T SAY THAT BOTS ARE BAD.

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:38.468 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE IN MY LEGISLATION WE

01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:39.735 region:rollup2
DON'T LIMIT THE USE OF POTS WE

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:41.237 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DON'T. CHANGE THE

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:44.006 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:45.241 region:rollup2
OF THE BOTS AS WELL OR HOW. ARE

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:45.808 region:rollup2
THE WEALTHIEST CORPORATIONS IN

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.309 region:rollup2
HISTORY THE WORLD ARE USING

01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:47.844 region:rollup2
BOTS.

01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:49.645 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:51.247 region:rollup2
IT'S CLOSE THE FACT

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:52.849 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE I GATHER

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:54.684 region:rollup2
INFORMATION PERSONALLY

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:56.385 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION SO WE

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:57.954 region:rollup2
CAN CHOOSE NOT TO ADVANCE THE

01:10:56.385 --> 01:11:00.189 region:rollup2
BILL. TODAY.

01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:01.891 region:rollup2
AND I COULD GIVE THE CLOTHES

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:03.192 region:rollup2
FOR YOU KNOW MY OPPOSITION WHICH

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:05.194 region:rollup2
IS THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:06.562 region:rollup2
HERE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:08.131 region:rollup2
NOT. HARMING ANYBODY.

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:09.198 region:rollup2
WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:10.466 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF HOW THE

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:11.334 region:rollup2
SPOTS ARE BEING USED AND THAT'S

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:12.802 region:rollup2
THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS THE

01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:14.070 region:rollup2
INTENT MOVING FORWARD IT'S GOOD

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:15.071 region:rollup2
TO KNOW AND IT'S VERY HELPFUL IT

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.607 region:rollup2
KNOWING THOUGH THAT THAT

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:18.107 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE IS CAN. IS ONLY AS

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:20.810 region:rollup2
HELPFUL AS IT IS TRULY

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:21.744 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL AND SO IF IF I'M

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:23.412 region:rollup2
GETTING A DISCLOSURE WHEN I GO

01:11:21.744 --> 01:11:25.181 region:rollup2
TO A SITE IN A PRIVACY POLICY

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:26.816 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS THE CIDER THIS.

01:11:25.181 --> 01:11:28.251 region:rollup2
WHATEVER USES BOTS.

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:29.085 region:rollup2
AB I THINK WAS UNIVERSALLY THE

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:30.086 region:rollup2
IMPRESSION OF MOST OF OUR

01:11:29.085 --> 01:11:31.454 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS AS SOMETHING

01:11:30.086 --> 01:11:33.823 region:rollup2
NEFARIOUS IS GOING ON AND IT'S

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:35.424 region:rollup2
JUST BEEN DISCLOSED TO ME WHEN.

01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:36.025 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT ONLY NOT BE THE

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:37.560 region:rollup2
CASE BUT THAT MADE DISCOURAGE

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:39.695 region:rollup2
ME.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.663 region:rollup2
AND US FROM HAVING THE TYPE OF

MEANINGFUL IT'S IT'S AN

01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:45.468 region:rollup2
INTERESTING POINT THAT YOU MAKE

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:46.569 region:rollup2
I THINK OF THE SAME ARGUMENT

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:47.970 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT

01:11:46.569 --> 01:11:49.572 region:rollup2
COOKIES AND TWENTY THIRTEEN.

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:51.140 region:rollup2

UNDERSTANDING OF HOW COOKIES ARE

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:56.012 region:rollup2

THEM SMASHED UP IMMEDIATELY AND

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:25.647 region:rollup2
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP WHAT

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:27.015 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IF YOU GET A SMALL

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:27.816 region:rollup2
LITTLE PUSH ON IT. I MEAN IT'S

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:29.184 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:30.619 region:rollup2
CUSHION THERE TOO OR IF YOU SAY

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:32.054 region:rollup2
YOU'RE BUYING FLOUR FOR EXAMPLE

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:33.389 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA PACK ITSELF DOWN

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:34.957 region:rollup2
AFTER A LITTLE WHILE.

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:36.225 region:rollup2
SO YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF

01:21:34.957 --> 01:21:39.661 region:rollup2
EXTRA SPACE THERE.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:40.729 region:rollup2
IF SO I I EVEN LIKE THE ONE

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:41.764 region:rollup2
LIKE THE ECONOMIST ONE THAT'S.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:43.565 region:rollup2
TO ME THAT LOOK PRETTY BASIC

01:21:41.764 --> 01:21:45.200 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU CAN GET AN ACTUAL

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:47.069 region:rollup2
SIZE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:49.238 region:rollup2
AT YOUR COMPUTER AND YOU WOULD

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:49.571 region:rollup2
PUT THE MANUFACTURER OR A.

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:52.808 region:rollup2
GLORIA STORY.

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:54.009 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR A MORE RELIABLE

01:21:52.808 --> 01:21:55.077 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY JUST BECAUSE YOU

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:56.645 region:rollup2
LOOK IT UP ON THE INTERNET IT

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:57.980 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SHOW YOU THE EXACT SIZE

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:59.348 region:rollup2
SUCH WHY WE PUT THAT IN THERE I

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.849 region:rollup2
THINK THESE ARE COMMON SENSE.

01:21:59.348 --> 01:22:02.151 region:rollup2
APPROACHES BUT I WOULD FINISH

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.985 region:rollup2
OFF JUST BY SAYING I I DON'T

01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:04.520 region:rollup2
KNOW OF ANYBODY WHO WOULD SAY

01:22:02.985 --> 01:22:05.721 region:rollup2

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:07.970 region:rollup2

THAT WE OPPOSE THIS BILL AND I'M

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:31.600 region:rollup2
GOING TO TELL YOU WHY. FIRST OF

01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:34.536 region:rollup2
ALL TORO WAS A RENTAL CAR

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:35.937 region:rollup2
COMPANY UNTIL SIX MONTHS AGO.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:38.006 region:rollup2
THEY HAD AN OPERATION IT SAN

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:39.040 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO AIRPORT THEY DECLARED

01:29:38.006 --> 01:29:40.375 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES NOT TO BE A RENTAL

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.743 region:rollup2
CAR COMPANY BECAUSE THEY RENT

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:43.712 region:rollup2
THEIR CARS ON AN APP.

01:29:41.743 --> 01:29:45.814 region:rollup2
AND STOP FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:48.550 region:rollup2
INCLUDING ALL THE SAFETY RULES

01:29:45.814 --> 01:29:50.585 region:rollup2
RELATED TO. RENTAL CAR COMPANIES

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:52.387 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE CONSUMER RULES

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:55.056 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S MORE TO CONSUMERS

01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:58.293 region:rollup2
THAN CONSUMER RULES AND SAFETY.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:30:00.028 region:rollup2
VAN RECALL ISSUES IF THEY ARE

01:29:58.293 --> 01:30:02.264 region:rollup2
RENTAL COMPANY THEY'RE COVERED

01:30:00.028 --> 01:30:04.532 region:rollup2
BY RECALL BUT THEY ALSO CAN'T

01:30:02.264 --> 01:30:05.767 region:rollup2

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:10.805 region:rollup2
GOOD WORKING ORDER.

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:12.140 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF THINGS

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:14.242 region:rollup2
THAT THOUGHT OF ACCIDENTS GET

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:15.944 region:rollup2
HAPPEN BECAUSE CARS ARE NOT

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:16.711 region:rollup2
MAINTAINED APPROPRIATELY WHICH

01:30:15.944 --> 01:30:18.613 region:rollup2
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SAFETY

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:20.081 region:rollup2
RECALLS.

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:21.683 region:rollup2
SAFETY RECALL SHOULD BE COVERED

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:23.151 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE

01:30:21.683 --> 01:30:24.919 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WAS THE FIRST VERSION

01:30:23.151 --> 01:30:26.588 region:rollup2
OF THIS IS JUST THE NEXT.

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:28.657 region:rollup2
ONE OF THESE THINGS WHERE

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:29.658 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY CREATES AN APP AND SAYS

01:30:28.657 --> 01:30:31.493 region:rollup2
THERE ARE BASICALLY A

01:30:29.658 --> 01:30:32.527 region:rollup2
DEREGULATED BUSINESS SO WHEN

01:30:31.493 --> 01:30:34.296 region:rollup2
THEY COME HERE SAYING THEY'RE

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:37.432 region:rollup2
ASKING TO BE REGULATED. THEY'RE

01:30:34.296 --> 01:30:40.402 region:rollup2
ASKING TO BE DEREGULATED.

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:41.369 region:rollup2
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.

01:30:40.402 --> 01:30:42.270 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GOING

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:42.938 region:rollup2
ON HERE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:44.773 region:rollup2
VOTING FOR.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:46.474 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:48.443 region:rollup2
THIS SANTA SCHOOL AIRPORT HAS

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:49.577 region:rollup2
LITIGATION AGAINST THEM SAYING

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:51.279 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE YOU CHANGE

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:52.747 region:rollup2
YOUR NAME AND STOP FOLLOWING ALL

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.149 region:rollup2
THE RULES DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:55.083 region:rollup2
NOT A RENTAL CAR COMPANY. AND

01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:56.785 region:rollup2
THEY SAID WELL WE'RE ONE OF

01:30:55.083 --> 01:30:58.586 region:rollup2
THESE PERSONAL SHARING PLATFORMS

01:30:56.785 --> 01:31:00.055 region:rollup2
AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THESE

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:02.924 region:rollup2
PERSONAL SHARING PLATFORMS AND

01:31:00.055 --> 01:31:05.126 region:rollup2
WHY THEY ARE NOT ONE OF THOSE.

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:06.928 region:rollup2
YOU CANNOT MAKE A PROFIT.

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:08.663 region:rollup2
YOU CANNOT HAVE ANY VEHICLE IN

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:11.333 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL SERVICE.

01:31:08.663 --> 01:31:13.301 region:rollup2
AND WORSE THAN THAT.

01:31:11.333 --> 01:31:15.036 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN THIS PROVISION.

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:16.104 region:rollup2
IN THAT INSURANCE CODE PROVISION

01:31:15.036 --> 01:31:18.273 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS AND I JUST WANT TO

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:20.408 region:rollup2
READ THIS TO YOU THE PRIMARY AND

01:31:18.273 --> 01:31:21.876 region:rollup2
EXCESS INSURER OR INSURERS AND

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:23.611 region:rollup2
THE OWNERS OPERATORS AND

01:31:21.876 --> 01:31:25.914 region:rollup2
MAINTAINERS OF THE PRIVATE

01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:27.349 region:rollup2
PASSENGER MOTOR VEHICLE. USED IN

01:31:25.914 --> 01:31:29.351 region:rollup2
A PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING

01:31:27.349 --> 01:31:31.319 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO

01:31:29.351 --> 01:31:34.189 region:rollup2
NOTIFY AND ENSURED THAT IT HAS

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:36.124 region:rollup2
NO DUTY TO DEFEND OR INDEMNIFY

01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:38.326 region:rollup2
ANY PERSON ORGANIZATION FOR

01:31:36.124 --> 01:31:39.594 region:rollup2
LIABILITY. FOR ANY LOSS THAT

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:41.396 region:rollup2
OCCURS DURING THE USE OF THE

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:43.932 region:rollup2
VEHICLE IN A PERSONAL VEHICLE

01:31:41.396 --> 01:31:45.266 region:rollup2
SHARING PROGRAM SO THE PERSON

01:31:43.932 --> 01:31:46.501 region:rollup2
WHO RENTS THE CAR.

01:31:45.266 --> 01:31:47.569 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO THE PERSON WHO

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:49.371 region:rollup2
OWNS THE CAR DOESN'T HAVE

01:31:47.569 --> 01:31:50.872 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

01:31:49.371 --> 01:31:53.141 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS NOT A GOOD BILL FOR

01:31:50.872 --> 01:31:55.910 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS LASTLY.

01:31:53.141 --> 01:31:58.380 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT TOROS WEBSITE

01:31:55.910 --> 01:32:00.281 region:rollup2
IT TALKS ABOUT RENTING A CAR IF

01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:01.449 region:rollup2
YOU WILL IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:02.450 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT

01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:03.885 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IT SAYS MAKE MONEY OFF

01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:05.553 region:rollup2
YOUR CAR.

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:07.889 region:rollup2
SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A FOR PROFIT

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:08.790 region:rollup2
RENTAL CAR BUSINESS.

01:32:07.889 --> 01:32:10.291 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IS MORE PERNICIOUS

01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:12.227 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT.

01:32:10.291 --> 01:32:14.229 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS

01:32:12.227 --> 01:32:15.997 region:rollup2
NO AND YOU NEED TO NOW.

01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:18.400 region:rollup2
ISN'T THIS IS JUST THE NEXT SUB

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:20.201 region:rollup2
PRIME LENDING DEAL IN THE AUTO

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:22.270 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT.

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:23.905 region:rollup2
GET YOURSELF INTO A CAR THAT YOU

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:25.874 region:rollup2
CAN'T AFFORD.

01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:27.642 region:rollup2
AND WE ALL AND THAT'S WHY THE

01:32:25.874 --> 01:32:28.877 region:rollup2
AUTO COMPANIES ARE INVESTING

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:30.945 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY IN THE SKY IN THE EAST

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:32.747 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:35.517 region:rollup2
PUT YOURSELF INTO A CAR THAT YOU

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:37.152 region:rollup2
CAN AFFORD AND HELP YOURSELF PAY

01:32:35.517 --> 01:32:38.553 region:rollup2
THE LOAN THAT YOU WOULDN'T

01:32:37.152 --> 01:32:40.422 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE QUALIFIED FOR. FOR

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:42.257 region:rollup2
BEING IN THE HOUSE.

01:32:40.422 --> 01:32:44.159 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOOK AT IT TAKE A LOOK AT

01:32:42.257 --> 01:32:46.428 region:rollup2
THEIR WEBSITE SEE HOW THEY ARE

01:32:44.159 --> 01:32:48.229 region:rollup2
ARE CLAIMING TO ATTRACT PEOPLE.

01:32:46.428 --> 01:32:49.531 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM AND

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:51.433 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT HERE SOME

01:32:49.531 --> 01:32:53.435 region:rollup2
DAY IF THIS THING.

01:32:51.433 --> 01:32:55.603 region:rollup2
TAKES OFF AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO

01:32:53.435 --> 01:32:58.006 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMER RULES OF THE RENTAL

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:58.873 region:rollup2
CAR INDUSTRY FINE TO HAVE IT.

01:32:58.006 --> 01:33:00.375 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS THE RENTAL CAR

01:32:58.873 --> 01:33:02.143 region:rollup2
BUSINESS AND ALL THE RENTAL CAR

01:33:00.375 --> 01:33:04.312 region:rollup2
COMPANY SHOULD BE UNDER THE SAME

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:05.280 region:rollup2
SET OF CONSUMER RULES THAT'S THE

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:06.614 region:rollup2
ONLY THING THAT'S REALLY FAIR

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.649 region:rollup2
AND EQUITABLE.

INTERPRETATION IS IN DIRECT

01:48:25.132 --> 01:48:28.335 region:rollup2
CONFLICT WITH GETTING THE

ISSUES OF CONCERN. BUT BECAUSE

01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:46.153 region:rollup2
THIS WAS DOUBLE REFERRED.

01:48:44.418 --> 01:48:47.755 region:rollup2
AYE TO JUST HAD THIS

01:48:46.153 --> 01:48:49.156 region:rollup2

01:48:47.755 --> 01:48:51.291 region:rollup2
BEFORE US HERE TODAY.

01:48:49.156 --> 01:48:53.026 region:rollup2

01:48:51.291 --> 01:48:55.262 region:rollup2
THOSE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:57.131 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO ENGAGE IN LOOK AT

01:48:55.262 --> 01:49:00.300 region:rollup2

END TAX MIGHT BE. OF BUT AGAIN

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:03.070 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY BEFORE US.

01:49:01.568 --> 01:49:05.139 region:rollup2
IT IF WE WERE TO VOTE NO AND DO

01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:07.341 region:rollup2
NOTHING SAYS CO EXIST THESE THIS

01:49:05.139 --> 01:49:09.109 region:rollup2
COMPANIES TO OPERATE. ACCORDING

01:49:07.341 --> 01:49:11.178 region:rollup2

01:57:35.882 --> 01:57:39.452 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I DO EXPECT COMPANIES TO

CONDUCT BUSINESS ONLINE TO BE

01:57:39.452 --> 01:57:43.189 region:rollup2
HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD. AS

01:57:40.987 --> 01:57:44.624 region:rollup2
BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES.

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:46.893 region:rollup2
IT'S HELL TO SPECIAL WHEN IT

01:57:44.624 --> 01:57:48.595 region:rollup2
COMES TO SALES TO MINORS.

01:57:46.893 --> 01:57:50.196 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW SOME ONLINE BUSINESSES

01:57:48.595 --> 01:57:52.132 region:rollup2
ARE NOT EVEN TRYING TO BE HELD

01:57:50.196 --> 01:57:53.867 region:rollup2
TO THE SAME STANDARD.

01:57:52.132 --> 01:57:55.835 region:rollup2
MY SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH MAJOR

01:57:53.867 --> 01:57:57.971 region:rollup2

01:57:57.971 --> 01:58:01.775 region:rollup2
IN CONDUCT DISORDER.

01:58:00.073 --> 01:58:04.044 region:rollup2
MY SON WAS ABLE TO USE A GIFT

AMAZON.

01:58:06.613 --> 01:58:08.615 region:rollup2
MAINLY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

01:58:07.981 --> 01:58:11.251 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFICATION WHEN PURCHASING

01:58:08.615 --> 01:58:12.686 region:rollup2
THOSE PRODUCTS.

01:58:11.251 --> 01:58:14.788 region:rollup2
WHEN ONLINE RETAILERS LIKE

01:58:12.686 --> 01:58:16.323 region:rollup2
AMAZON ARE SELLING PRODUCTS THEY

01:58:14.788 --> 01:58:18.425 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE SELLING

01:58:16.323 --> 01:58:19.225 region:rollup2

01:58:18.425 --> 01:58:20.560 region:rollup2
WHO THEIR SONGS YOU LOOK

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:21.595 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS MAY HAVE?

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.862 region:rollup2
ALL THE MORE REASON FOR

01:58:21.595 --> 01:58:25.465 region:rollup2
COMPANIES CONDUCTING BUSINESS

01:58:22.862 --> 01:58:27.767 region:rollup2
ONLINE TO TAKE REASONABLE ACTION

01:58:25.465 --> 01:58:28.935 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT SALES TO MINORS.

01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:30.937 region:rollup2
THESE COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO BE

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:32.939 region:rollup2
PERFECT.

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:33.873 region:rollup2
BUT THEY MUST DO BETTER WHEN IT

01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:36.076 region:rollup2
COMES INSURING THE SAFETY OF

01:58:33.873 --> 01:58:37.877 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS.

REASONABLE STEPS TO VERIFY. THE

AGE OF THE PURCHASER OF PRODUCTS

01:58:44.818 --> 01:58:49.122 region:rollup2

ETCETERA THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN THAT REGARD.

02:05:40.767 --> 02:05:45.071 region:rollup2
THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT A

SO ON THE CONTRARY IT CONCERN

02:05:55.882 --> 02:05:58.985 region:rollup2
IS.

02:05:57.083 --> 02:06:00.019 region:rollup2
THAT THE BILL APPLIES TO MINOR

AND. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE.

02:06:04.857 --> 02:06:07.360 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED SO THAT PEOPLE CAN

02:06:16.803 --> 02:06:21.240 region:rollup2
THEN.

02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:22.275 region:rollup2
MAYBE IS THE INTENT.

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:23.976 region:rollup2
AND ONE THING THAT WAS

02:06:22.275 --> 02:06:25.011 region:rollup2
REFERENCED.

02:06:23.976 --> 02:06:25.845 region:rollup2
IN THE OPENING STATEMENTS OF THE

IS A CONCERN ABOUT COMPANIES

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:32.018 region:rollup2
USING THE LIKENESS OF A MINOR

02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:34.987 region:rollup2

02:06:32.018 --> 02:06:35.988 region:rollup2
NO.

02:06:34.987 --> 02:06:38.157 region:rollup2
IF THAT'S THAT CONCERN HERE IN

02:06:35.988 --> 02:06:39.792 region:rollup2
ASPEN NO CONCERN CALIFORNIA LAW

02:06:38.157 --> 02:06:41.027 region:rollup2
ALREADY REGULATES THAT IT

02:06:39.792 --> 02:06:42.995 region:rollup2
REQUIRES PARENTS WILL CONSENT.

02:06:41.027 --> 02:06:44.430 region:rollup2
IN THAT REGARD THAT'S.

02:06:42.995 --> 02:06:45.631 region:rollup2

RIGHT TO CONTROL WHO YOU ARE IF

ANYONE'S MAKING MONEY ON THAT

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:48.701 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALREADY DRESSED IN

02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:50.536 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LAW.

02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:51.971 region:rollup2
SO THIS.

02:06:50.536 --> 02:06:52.738 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ON BOTH PIECES THE

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:53.773 region:rollup2
SOCIAL MEDIA PIECE IN THE

02:06:52.738 --> 02:06:55.541 region:rollup2
RESELLER PIECE.

ALREADY REGULATED ACTIVITY

02:06:57.443 --> 02:07:00.146 region:rollup2
ALREADY PROHIBITED CONDUCT AND

02:06:59.045 --> 02:07:02.348 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE MECHANICS

02:07:00.146 --> 02:07:04.317 region:rollup2
OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:07:02.348 --> 02:07:04.984 region:rollup2
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL.

02:07:04.317 --> 02:07:07.186 region:rollup2
DOESN'T

02:07:04.984 --> 02:07:07.687 region:rollup2
HELP

02:07:07.186 --> 02:07:08.721 region:rollup2
SHED LIGHT ON WHAT THOSE

02:07:07.687 --> 02:07:11.190 region:rollup2
MECHANICS OR.

02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:13.793 region:rollup2
AND.

02:07:11.190 --> 02:07:14.827 region:rollup2
THERE IS REFERENCE THAT.

02:07:13.793 --> 02:07:15.461 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY SHOULD TAKE

02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:17.363 region:rollup2
REASONABLE MEASURES TO DO THESE

02:07:15.461 --> 02:07:18.631 region:rollup2
THINGS.

02:07:17.363 --> 02:07:19.932 region:rollup2
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN THE SOCIAL

02:07:18.631 --> 02:07:22.368 region:rollup2
MEDIA PIECE

02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:24.604 region:rollup2
THE BILL REQUIRES PERFECTION.

02:07:22.368 --> 02:07:27.473 region:rollup2
STRICT LIABILITY THAT.

02:07:24.604 --> 02:07:28.040 region:rollup2
THESE WEBSITES FIGURE OUT.

02:07:27.473 --> 02:07:31.611 region:rollup2
THE AGE OF EVERYONE ON THE

PLATFORM AND TO THE PARENT HITS.

02:07:31.611 --> 02:07:35.815 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT.

02:07:33.613 --> 02:07:37.116 region:rollup2
WAS VERY CONCERNING TO US.

02:07:35.815 --> 02:07:37.984 region:rollup2
AND THE MECHANICS OF HOW TO DO

02:07:37.116 --> 02:07:43.122 region:rollup2
THAT

02:07:37.984 --> 02:07:44.657 region:rollup2
ESCAPE US AT THIS TIME.

02:07:43.122 --> 02:07:45.725 region:rollup2
THE ONLY THING YOU KNOW THE ONLY

02:07:44.657 --> 02:07:46.459 region:rollup2
WAY IF POTENTIALLY DOING

02:07:45.725 --> 02:07:47.660 region:rollup2
ESCORTING MUCH MORE VERY

02:07:46.459 --> 02:07:49.195 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT I

02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:50.930 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK.

02:07:49.195 --> 02:07:51.297 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH

02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:53.599 region:rollup2
HIM COMPANIES.

02:07:51.297 --> 02:07:54.967 region:rollup2
GETTING.

02:07:53.599 --> 02:07:56.936 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN A STRICT LIABILITY ON

02:07:54.967 --> 02:07:57.570 region:rollup2
WEBSITE LEARNING THE TRUE AGE

02:07:56.936 --> 02:07:58.671 region:rollup2
NINETEEN THE OF EVERYONE ON THE

02:07:58.671 --> 02:08:03.676 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THE ONEROUS.

02:08:02.341 --> 02:08:04.610 region:rollup2
IN FUNDAMENTAL WAYS TO CAMINO

02:08:03.676 --> 02:08:06.312 region:rollup2
CSUS NOSE MINERS HAVE

02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:08.214 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS THERE'S

02:08:06.312 --> 02:08:09.916 region:rollup2
NOT A MAGIC. SWITCH THE FLIPS

02:08:08.214 --> 02:08:11.417 region:rollup2
ONLY TURNED EIGHTEEN.

02:08:09.916 --> 02:08:13.352 region:rollup2
MINORS CAN ENTER INTO CONTRACTS

02:08:11.417 --> 02:08:14.654 region:rollup2
SO THE IDEA THAT TEENAGER MAY

02:08:13.352 --> 02:08:16.656 region:rollup2
NOT BUILDING GAGE ALSO FROM YOUR

02:08:14.654 --> 02:08:17.990 region:rollup2

THEIR PARENT IS IN OBTAINING

02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:21.794 region:rollup2
THAT PARENTS CONSENT. IS VERY

02:08:19.492 --> 02:08:23.029 region:rollup2
CONCERNING.

02:08:21.794 --> 02:08:24.063 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S A

02:08:23.029 --> 02:08:25.731 region:rollup2
SENSITIVITY OF ISSUES OF THE

MINERS HAVING.

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:28.234 region:rollup2
SHE'S A HOME OF THE MINOR SIMPLY

02:08:26.799 --> 02:08:29.902 region:rollup2

02:08:28.234 --> 02:08:31.704 region:rollup2
SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE.

02:08:29.902 --> 02:08:33.573 region:rollup2
AND AS

02:08:31.704 --> 02:08:35.408 region:rollup2
AS MISTER HOWARD. AND KNOWLEDGE

02:08:33.573 --> 02:08:36.008 region:rollup2
YOU MAY NOT BILL TO BE PERFECT.

02:08:35.408 --> 02:08:37.577 region:rollup2
YOU CAN FORGE THAT PERMISSION

02:08:36.008 --> 02:08:38.277 region:rollup2
SLIP.

02:08:37.577 --> 02:08:39.579 region:rollup2
BEGIN THE BILL REQUIRES

02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:40.179 region:rollup2
PERFECTION WITH A STRICT

02:08:39.579 --> 02:08:45.585 region:rollup2

02:08:40.179 --> 02:08:47.320 region:rollup2
OF THE BILL.

02:08:45.585 --> 02:08:48.387 region:rollup2
WHEN I REFERENCE THE ROBUST

02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:50.590 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS THERE IN PLACE IN

02:08:48.387 --> 02:08:52.491 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LAW AND FEDERAL LAW.

02:08:50.590 --> 02:08:54.160 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT ALL OF THOSE

02:08:52.491 --> 02:08:55.528 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS RELY.

02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:57.196 region:rollup2
RELY ON A REPRESENTATION MADE BY

02:08:55.528 --> 02:08:58.965 region:rollup2
THE USER AT SOME POINT.

02:08:57.196 --> 02:08:59.765 region:rollup2
AND SO.

02:08:58.965 --> 02:09:02.001 region:rollup2
THERE'S A REFERENCE MADE THE

02:08:59.765 --> 02:09:03.536 region:rollup2
QUESTION SHOULD BE ASKED.

02:09:02.001 --> 02:09:05.238 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT DISAGREEING WITH THAT

02:09:03.536 --> 02:09:06.939 region:rollup2
WERE SAYING WHICH THE PROOF IT'S

02:09:05.238 --> 02:09:08.507 region:rollup2
REQUIRED WHERE'S THE BURDEN

02:09:06.939 --> 02:09:10.910 region:rollup2
HOW'RE WE GOING TO DO THAT THOSE

02:09:08.507 --> 02:09:12.878 region:rollup2
OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE.

02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:14.213 region:rollup2
SO THIS BILL TOSSES OUT THE

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:14.747 region:rollup2
APPROACH OF ENTIRE BODY OF

02:09:14.213 --> 02:09:15.915 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LAW TO PROTECT

MINORS.

02:09:15.915 --> 02:09:19.318 region:rollup2

02:09:18.184 --> 02:09:20.486 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT IS

02:09:19.318 --> 02:09:22.722 region:rollup2
ALREADY PROHIBITED.

WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF

COMMERCE TESTIFYING IN

02:09:36.168 --> 02:09:39.472 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WE WISH

02:09:38.070 --> 02:09:41.007 region:rollup2
TO JOIN IN THE REMARKS OF MR

IN THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION

02:09:42.041 --> 02:09:45.311 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE EMPHASIS ON THE

02:09:43.576 --> 02:09:46.912 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING CHILD

02:09:45.311 --> 02:09:48.280 region:rollup2
SAFETY ONLINE.

02:09:46.912 --> 02:09:49.382 region:rollup2
I'M ADDITIONALLY WITH RESPECT TO

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.083 region:rollup2
THE PROVISIONS OF OF THE BILL

02:09:49.382 --> 02:09:52.184 region:rollup2
AIMED AT ONLINE RETAIL SALES WE

02:09:51.083 --> 02:09:54.420 region:rollup2
WOULD EMPHASIZE THE FOLLOWING

02:09:52.184 --> 02:09:55.788 region:rollup2
THREE CONCERNS. FIRST WHETHER

02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:57.089 region:rollup2
THE SALES ONLINE OR NOT IT'S

02:09:55.788 --> 02:09:58.324 region:rollup2
ALREADY ILLEGAL TO SELL THE

02:09:57.089 --> 02:09:59.759 region:rollup2
PROHIBITED ITEMS LISTED IN THIS

02:09:58.324 --> 02:10:01.260 region:rollup2
BILL TO MINORS THE COMPANY

02:09:59.759 --> 02:10:02.428 region:rollup2
VIOLATES THE CURRENT LAW THERE

02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:04.130 region:rollup2
ARE THE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT

02:10:02.428 --> 02:10:05.564 region:rollup2
ACTIONS.

02:10:04.130 --> 02:10:06.899 region:rollup2
SECOND GIVEN THAT WE SHOULD NOT

02:10:05.564 --> 02:10:08.100 region:rollup2
BE LEGISLATING THE MECHANISM BY

02:10:06.899 --> 02:10:09.568 region:rollup2
WHICH COMPANIES COMPLY WITH

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:11.070 region:rollup2
THESE LAWS THIS BILL WOULD

02:10:09.568 --> 02:10:12.638 region:rollup2
REQUIRE COMPANIES TO VERIFY THE

02:10:11.070 --> 02:10:14.707 region:rollup2
AGE OF A PURCHASER WHICH IS

02:10:12.638 --> 02:10:16.609 region:rollup2
BEYOND REQUIRING AN ID CHECK OF

02:10:14.707 --> 02:10:17.376 region:rollup2
THE PERSON AT DELIVERY.

02:10:16.609 --> 02:10:18.844 region:rollup2
WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE

02:10:17.376 --> 02:10:19.512 region:rollup2
PURCHASER?

02:10:18.844 --> 02:10:20.980 region:rollup2
OUR MEMBER COMPANIES ARE

02:10:19.512 --> 02:10:22.281 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN

02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:23.015 region:rollup2
VERIFY THE AGE OF SOMEONE AT

02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:25.017 region:rollup2
POINT OF SALE.

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:26.986 region:rollup2
BUYING ONLINE.

02:10:25.017 --> 02:10:27.787 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY THIS LANGUAGES

02:10:26.986 --> 02:10:29.221 region:rollup2
PRESENTED WHEN THE COMMITTEE

02:10:27.787 --> 02:10:31.424 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCES WENT PUBLIC JUST A FEW

02:10:29.221 --> 02:10:31.857 region:rollup2
DAYS AGO. LANGUAGE SEEKS TO MAKE

02:10:31.424 --> 02:10:34.093 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO A MASSIVE

02:10:31.857 --> 02:10:35.161 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE.

02:10:34.093 --> 02:10:36.295 region:rollup2
THE BILL WOULD WORK BOWL THIS

02:10:35.161 --> 02:10:38.064 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL MORE

02:10:36.295 --> 02:10:38.898 region:rollup2
THOUGHT AND SUBSTANTIVE POLICY

02:10:38.064 --> 02:10:40.1000 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS AS TO HOW IT WOULD

02:10:38.898 --> 02:10:42.134 region:rollup2
WORK AN IS THE UNANTICIPATED

02:10:40.1000 --> 02:10:43.536 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY RESULT.

02:10:42.134 --> 02:10:45.304 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE NEW LANGUAGE

02:10:43.536 --> 02:10:46.939 region:rollup2
STATES THAT A COMPANY MAY NOT

02:10:45.304 --> 02:10:48.808 region:rollup2
DELIVER PRESCRIBED PRODUCTS TO A

02:10:46.939 --> 02:10:50.710 region:rollup2
PERSON UNDER EIGHTEEN OR WHAT IF

02:10:48.808 --> 02:10:51.644 region:rollup2
A COMPANY. HAS A POLICY NOT TO

02:10:50.710 --> 02:10:53.245 region:rollup2
DELIVER CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO

02:10:51.644 --> 02:10:55.347 region:rollup2
MINOR BUT THEN A THIRD PARTY

02:10:53.245 --> 02:10:56.682 region:rollup2
DELIVERY SERVICE DOES SO ANYWAY

02:10:55.347 --> 02:10:57.950 region:rollup2
WHO IS LIABLE IN THAT SITUATION.

02:10:56.682 --> 02:10:59.051 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONSIDERATION BE THE

02:10:57.950 --> 02:11:00.286 region:rollup2
FACT THAT COMPANIES WOULD NEED

02:10:59.051 --> 02:11:01.687 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A DELIVERY

02:11:00.286 --> 02:11:03.723 region:rollup2
VERIFICATION SERVICE OVERNIGHT

02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:04.890 region:rollup2
IN A REASONABLE.

02:11:03.723 --> 02:11:06.325 region:rollup2
AN APPROPRIATE IMPLEMENTATION

02:11:04.890 --> 02:11:07.560 region:rollup2
DATE WOULD BE TO BE CONSIDERED

02:11:06.325 --> 02:11:08.527 region:rollup2
THERE'S LIKELY MUCH MORE WERE

02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:10.229 region:rollup2

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:50.749 region:rollup2
STEINBERG BILL.

02:14:49.448 --> 02:14:53.018 region:rollup2
WHICH DOES NOT REALLY ADDRESS

02:14:50.749 --> 02:14:55.087 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL PUBLIC IT'S TARGETED

02:14:53.018 --> 02:14:56.822 region:rollup2
TO KIDS ONLY. AND THERE'S ALSO

02:14:55.087 --> 02:14:58.924 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW BUT FEDERAL LAW OWNS

02:14:56.822 --> 02:15:00.192 region:rollup2
ONLY PERTAIN SEE KIDS UNDER THE

02:14:58.924 --> 02:15:01.226 region:rollup2
AGE OF THIRTEEN.

02:15:00.192 --> 02:15:03.629 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND THIS

02:15:01.226 --> 02:15:05.631 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR BILL ARE ADDRESSES

02:15:03.629 --> 02:15:07.266 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL WEBSITES FOR EXAMPLE

02:15:05.631 --> 02:15:09.335 region:rollup2
WEBSITES THAT ARE USED BY BOTH

02:15:07.266 --> 02:15:11.437 region:rollup2
KIDS AND ADULTS.

02:15:09.335 --> 02:15:13.472 region:rollup2
SO IN THAT REGARD. THERE'S NO

02:15:11.437 --> 02:15:15.407 region:rollup2
LAW CURRENT WEATHER Y. FEDERAL

02:15:13.472 --> 02:15:17.610 region:rollup2
OR STATE OR OTHERWISE THAT WOULD

02:15:15.407 --> 02:15:21.080 region:rollup2
COVER THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION.

02:15:17.610 --> 02:15:23.115 region:rollup2
AND ARE AS TO THE OUR. ASSERTION

02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:25.317 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE WE ARE DEPRIVING

02:15:23.115 --> 02:15:27.219 region:rollup2
THE KIT ARE HIS SO RIGHTS EITHER

02:15:25.317 --> 02:15:29.421 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL OR OTHERWISE THAT

02:15:27.219 --> 02:15:29.989 region:rollup2
IS NOT THE CASE BECAUSE THERE'S

02:15:29.421 --> 02:15:30.823 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT SAYS

02:15:29.989 --> 02:15:33.425 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:15:30.823 --> 02:15:35.628 region:rollup2
I EVEN IF THE KID DOES NOT

02:15:33.425 --> 02:15:37.363 region:rollup2
OBTAIN A PARENTAL CONCERN. HERE

02:15:35.628 --> 02:15:39.331 region:rollup2
SHE SHOULD NOT BE DENIED ACCESS

02:15:37.363 --> 02:15:40.399 region:rollup2
TO THE WEBSITE SO THAT'S CLEARLY

02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:41.800 region:rollup2
SPELLED OUT IN THE LANGUAGE

02:15:40.399 --> 02:15:43.836 region:rollup2
ITSELF.

02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:45.938 region:rollup2
AND THE ONLY DOING NOW IS

02:15:43.836 --> 02:15:47.873 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY TO SAY LOOK IF THESE

02:15:45.938 --> 02:15:50.142 region:rollup2
THIRD PARTY PEOPLE WANT TO USE

02:15:47.873 --> 02:15:51.944 region:rollup2
THE TILES INFORMATION.

02:15:50.142 --> 02:15:53.579 region:rollup2
NAMES AND.

02:15:51.944 --> 02:15:55.681 region:rollup2
LIKENESS OF PHOTOGRAPHS THEY

02:15:53.579 --> 02:15:57.182 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GET THE PRIOR PARENTAL

02:15:55.681 --> 02:15:59.018 region:rollup2
CONSENT THAT'S NUMBER ONE.

02:15:57.182 --> 02:16:00.686 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PIECE IS THAT.

02:15:59.018 --> 02:16:02.955 region:rollup2
IF THEY WANT TO BUY SOMETHING

02:16:00.686 --> 02:16:05.290 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL AND THOSE COMPANIES ARE

02:16:02.955 --> 02:16:06.625 region:rollup2
TO HOW THEY ARE. SOMETHING

02:16:05.290 --> 02:16:08.027 region:rollup2
COMPLACENT MAKE SURE THAT

02:16:06.625 --> 02:16:09.628 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAPPEN I MEAN THOSE ARE

02:16:08.027 --> 02:16:10.829 region:rollup2
THE TWO MAJOR ISSUES THAT WE'RE

02:16:09.628 --> 02:16:13.432 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT.

02:16:10.829 --> 02:16:14.733 region:rollup2
BUT HAVING SAID THAT I DO WANT

02:16:13.432 --> 02:16:16.335 region:rollup2
COMMIT MYSELF TO WORKING WOULD

02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:18.103 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOLKS TO YOU KNOW SORT

02:16:16.335 --> 02:16:19.538 region:rollup2
OUT THE THE WORKABILITY ISSUES

02:16:18.103 --> 02:16:22.174 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE. YOU KNOW HOW WE

02:16:19.538 --> 02:16:23.942 region:rollup2
GONNA DO THE CONSENT CURRENTLY.

02:16:22.174 --> 02:16:25.844 region:rollup2
THE BILL DOES NOT PRESCRIBE A

02:16:23.942 --> 02:16:28.614 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR METHOD FOR THE. FOR

02:16:25.844 --> 02:16:29.948 region:rollup2
THE FOLKS TO TO GET CONSENT BUT

02:16:28.614 --> 02:16:32.117 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY DRAFTING HAS NOTHING

02:16:29.948 --> 02:16:32.651 region:rollup2
IS BEING DONE SO ANYTHING THAT

02:16:32.117 --> 02:16:33.685 region:rollup2
WE COULD DO IS BETTER THAN

02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:35.487 region:rollup2
NOTHING.

02:16:33.685 --> 02:16:36.055 region:rollup2
SO SO THAT'S THAT'S TO THAT'S

02:16:35.487 --> 02:16:37.890 region:rollup2
THE THE CHEST OF THE OF THE

02:16:36.055 --> 02:16:39.591 region:rollup2
BILL.

02:16:37.890 --> 02:16:42.161 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S A TOTALLY

02:16:39.591 --> 02:16:45.764 region:rollup2
REASONABLE BILL IN MY VIEW.

02:16:42.161 --> 02:16:47.399 region:rollup2
IF I JUST.

02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:48.600 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND WE

02:16:47.399 --> 02:16:50.502 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT SOMETHING

02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:52.871 region:rollup2
WHICH IS OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE WE

02:16:50.502 --> 02:16:55.007 region:rollup2
WANNA. A THIS SET THE LOSS AT

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:56.642 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD ALLOW A LITTLE BIT

02:16:55.007 --> 02:17:00.446 region:rollup2
OF FLEXIBILITY HERE FOR HOW.

02:16:56.642 --> 02:17:01.980 region:rollup2
HOW THE LAW? IS COMPLIED WITH

02:17:00.446 --> 02:17:04.083 region:rollup2
WHAT MISTER HOWARD YOU WANT

02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:04.550 region:rollup2
SPEECH AT THAT ISSUE. HIS WE

02:17:04.083 --> 02:17:06.719 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM.

02:17:04.550 --> 02:17:09.154 region:rollup2
AT THE OPPONENTS.

02:17:06.719 --> 02:17:11.256 region:rollup2
AS WELL ON THE.

02:17:09.154 --> 02:17:12.624 region:rollup2
SORT OF PRESCRIPTIVE NATURE OF

02:17:11.256 --> 02:17:15.761 region:rollup2
THIS BUT I JUST HEARD THE OTHER

02:17:12.624 --> 02:17:17.963 region:rollup2
SAY WERE WERE NOT. WELL IT IS.

02:17:15.761 --> 02:17:19.465 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE.

02:17:17.963 --> 02:17:21.266 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE YOUR POISON

02:17:19.465 --> 02:17:22.101 region:rollup2
RISK WITH NO DISRESPECT.

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:24.570 region:rollup2
WITH AN OPPOSITION THAT WILL

02:17:22.101 --> 02:17:26.839 region:rollup2
ENGAGE.

02:17:24.570 --> 02:17:28.740 region:rollup2
SO EITHER WE COULD HAVE DONE

02:17:26.839 --> 02:17:30.075 region:rollup2
SOMETHING VERY PRESCRIPTIVE.

02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:32.311 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD PROVIDE REGULATED

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:33.345 region:rollup2
ENTITIES ABSOLUTE CRYSTALLINE

02:17:32.311 --> 02:17:34.947 region:rollup2
CLARITY ABOUT HOW TO COMPLY WITH

02:17:33.345 --> 02:17:36.615 region:rollup2
IT. AND THEN THE OPPOSITION

02:17:34.947 --> 02:17:38.951 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HERE SAYING YOU'RE

02:17:36.615 --> 02:17:40.185 region:rollup2
STIFLING INNOVATION YOUR E. OR

02:17:38.951 --> 02:17:40.719 region:rollup2
PREVENTING US FROM BEING ABLE TO

02:17:40.185 --> 02:17:42.154 region:rollup2
INNOVATE OUR WAY OUT OF A

02:17:40.719 --> 02:17:44.323 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

02:17:42.154 --> 02:17:45.958 region:rollup2
THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO TAKE THE

02:17:44.323 --> 02:17:47.626 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAT IS CURRENTLY SEEN

02:17:45.958 --> 02:17:49.661 region:rollup2
IN THE BILL WHICH WE SEE.

02:17:47.626 --> 02:17:50.295 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT MANY DIFFERENT KINDS

02:17:49.661 --> 02:17:51.597 region:rollup2
OF LAWS.

02:17:50.295 --> 02:17:53.398 region:rollup2
IT THE AT.

02:17:51.597 --> 02:17:55.400 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

02:17:53.398 --> 02:17:57.169 region:rollup2
EGGMAN REASONABLE STEPS TO

02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:59.938 region:rollup2
VERIFY AGE.

02:17:57.169 --> 02:18:01.039 region:rollup2
I DID THE GENTLEMAN. UP FROM THE

02:17:59.938 --> 02:18:03.609 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION WAS TALKING ABOUT

02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:05.477 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS RELATED TO BURDEN.

02:18:03.609 --> 02:18:07.179 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS RELATING TO PROVE.

02:18:05.477 --> 02:18:08.213 region:rollup2
I MY THAT THAT THE CHILDREN'S

02:18:07.179 --> 02:18:09.148 region:rollup2
ADVOCACY INSTITUTE AND ITS

02:18:08.213 --> 02:18:11.383 region:rollup2
SISTER ORGANIZATION THE CENTER

02:18:09.148 --> 02:18:14.119 region:rollup2
FOR PUBLIC INTEREST.

02:18:11.383 --> 02:18:17.456 region:rollup2
ORG DEEPLY COMMITTED TO BEING

02:18:14.119 --> 02:18:19.992 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PROVIDE A CLEAR LAW.

02:18:17.456 --> 02:18:22.394 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT IN ANY WAY A GOTCHA.

02:18:19.992 --> 02:18:23.896 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS EVERY SINGLE COMPANY

02:18:22.394 --> 02:18:25.597 region:rollup2
WITH ABSOLUTE CLARITY TO BE ABLE

02:18:23.896 --> 02:18:27.266 region:rollup2
TO CONFORM THEIR BEHAVIOR IN

02:18:25.597 --> 02:18:29.301 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. IN

02:18:27.266 --> 02:18:30.402 region:rollup2
ORDER FOR US TO DO THAT IN A WAY

02:18:29.301 --> 02:18:32.404 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THE

02:18:30.402 --> 02:18:35.140 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION. I NEED THEM TO SIT

02:18:32.404 --> 02:18:35.707 region:rollup2
DOWN AND ENGAGE AND SAY WHAT

02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:36.809 region:rollup2
WOULD WORK FOR YOU AND WHAT

02:18:35.707 --> 02:18:39.611 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T.

02:18:36.809 --> 02:18:41.513 region:rollup2
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY EAGER I AM

02:18:39.611 --> 02:18:43.582 region:rollup2
IMPLORING THEM TO DO SO. SO ON

02:18:41.513 --> 02:18:45.117 region:rollup2
THE WORKABILITY ISSUES I CONCEDE

02:18:43.582 --> 02:18:48.387 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORD

02:18:45.117 --> 02:18:50.589 region:rollup2
REASONABLE STEPS TO VERIFY AGE.

02:18:48.387 --> 02:18:52.958 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT PER SCRIPTED

02:18:50.589 --> 02:18:53.625 region:rollup2
THERE IS SOME UNKNOWABLE THERE

02:18:52.958 --> 02:18:55.494 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WHAT YOU'RE

02:18:53.625 --> 02:18:57.362 region:rollup2
DOING. IS GOING TO BE IN

02:18:55.494 --> 02:18:58.897 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH LAW TO THE

02:18:57.362 --> 02:19:00.799 region:rollup2
EXTENT AS THAT IS A CONCERN.

02:18:58.897 --> 02:19:03.001 region:rollup2
LET'S FIGURE IT OUT. BUT ON THE

02:19:00.799 --> 02:19:04.937 region:rollup2
OTHER HAND IT ALSO OFFERS THESE

02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:06.438 region:rollup2
COMPANIES A ZILLION DIFFERENT

02:19:04.937 --> 02:19:07.906 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE WAYS.

02:19:06.438 --> 02:19:10.375 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AGE

02:19:07.906 --> 02:19:11.677 region:rollup2
VERIFICATION EVERYTHING FROM

02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:13.011 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SPIN CLASS THAT DID

02:19:11.677 --> 02:19:14.846 region:rollup2
THAT ONE WOMAN FRIEND OF MINE

02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:16.949 region:rollup2
OWNS YOU GO ONLINE YOU CLICK

PERSON OWNS THIS YOU GO ONLINE

02:19:20.085 --> 02:19:23.555 region:rollup2
YOU CLICK TO ENROLL IT ASKS FOR

02:19:21.987 --> 02:19:25.390 region:rollup2
YOUR AGE IF THE AGE OF THE

02:19:23.555 --> 02:19:26.225 region:rollup2
PERSON IS YOUNGER IT GOES TO A

02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:28.227 region:rollup2
FORM.

02:19:26.225 --> 02:19:30.162 region:rollup2
IT JUST FILLS OUT.

02:19:28.227 --> 02:19:31.763 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW KIND LONG HERE'S MY

02:19:30.162 --> 02:19:32.798 region:rollup2

TO MY MIND.

02:19:32.798 --> 02:19:37.302 region:rollup2
THAT'S FINE.

02:19:35.434 --> 02:19:38.971 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A MILLION TIMES BETTER

02:19:37.302 --> 02:19:40.906 region:rollup2
THAN THE STATUS QUO.

02:19:38.971 --> 02:19:42.307 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW HAS PROVEN TO BE

02:19:40.906 --> 02:19:44.109 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE TO ADDRESS THE

02:19:42.307 --> 02:19:44.910 region:rollup2
CURRENT STATUS QUO.

02:19:44.109 --> 02:19:46.111 region:rollup2
WHICH IS RESPECTFULLY

02:19:44.910 --> 02:19:47.779 region:rollup2
PREPOSTEROUS WHICH NO ONE HERE

02:19:46.111 --> 02:19:49.147 region:rollup2
HAS DEFENDED.

02:19:47.779 --> 02:19:50.449 region:rollup2
WHICH IS IN BOILERPLATE TERMS

02:19:49.147 --> 02:19:52.017 region:rollup2
AND CONDITIONS WHEN FACEBOOK

SEEKS TO USE MY CHILD IS A

02:19:52.017 --> 02:19:55.687 region:rollup2
BILLBOARD FOR ADVERTISING.

02:19:54.386 --> 02:19:57.522 region:rollup2
BAY AREA IN BOILERPLATE TERMS

02:19:55.687 --> 02:19:58.023 region:rollup2
AND CONDITIONS AND SAY QUOTE IF

02:19:57.522 --> 02:19:59.258 region:rollup2
YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF

02:19:58.023 --> 02:20:00.959 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN.

02:19:59.258 --> 02:20:02.461 region:rollup2
YOU REPRESENTED THAT A PARENT OR

02:20:00.959 --> 02:20:04.763 region:rollup2
LEGAL GUARDIAN ALSO EXPRESSLY

02:20:02.461 --> 02:20:07.232 region:rollup2
AGREES TO THIS.

02:20:04.763 --> 02:20:09.801 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE STATUS QUO.

02:20:07.232 --> 02:20:12.004 region:rollup2
THAT CLEARLY IS NOTHING.

02:20:09.801 --> 02:20:13.772 region:rollup2
WE CAN AS THE FIRST WITNESS SAID

02:20:12.004 --> 02:20:16.642 region:rollup2
DO BETTER WE SHOULD DO BETTER.

02:20:13.772 --> 02:20:17.943 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS VERY CLEAR.

02:20:16.642 --> 02:20:19.411 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE DIRECTION THAT BETTER

02:20:17.943 --> 02:20:20.379 region:rollup2
SHOULD GO INTO THE EXTENT OF

02:20:19.411 --> 02:20:21.480 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK ABILITY ISSUES I

02:20:20.379 --> 02:20:22.814 region:rollup2
WOULD. YOU EARN UP TO WORK THEM

02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:24.750 region:rollup2

02:20:22.814 --> 02:20:27.119 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THAT I'M OF THE BILL.

02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:28.520 region:rollup2

LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THE

02:20:30.689 --> 02:20:33.925 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE AT REGARDING.

02:20:31.556 --> 02:20:35.494 region:rollup2
THE.

02:20:33.925 --> 02:20:36.895 region:rollup2
REASONABLE STEPS AND FIRST FALL

02:20:36.895 --> 02:20:41.066 region:rollup2
TWO TEENAGERS.

02:20:38.397 --> 02:20:43.869 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

02:20:41.066 --> 02:20:45.304 region:rollup2
AND ALSO TO TO MAKE IT

02:20:43.869 --> 02:20:48.140 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS MEANINGFUL

02:20:45.304 --> 02:20:49.474 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT A. A CONSENT THAT

02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:50.809 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING MY KIDS ARE JUST

02:20:49.474 --> 02:20:52.811 region:rollup2
GONNA.

02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:55.147 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO IGNRE WHICH IN MY

02:20:52.811 --> 02:20:57.316 region:rollup2
DO. UP OR THAT IT IT JUST

02:20:55.147 --> 02:20:57.849 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE ANY PURPOSE TO IT

02:20:57.316 --> 02:21:00.018 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MAYBE ESTO BURIED

02:20:57.849 --> 02:21:01.687 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE. MINDFUL THAT WE THIS

02:21:00.018 --> 02:21:03.422 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE ENDS GOVERNMENT

02:21:01.687 --> 02:21:04.389 region:rollup2
PUTS A LOT OF DISCLOSURE BURDENS

02:21:03.422 --> 02:21:06.191 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:07.793 region:rollup2
THAT GET HIDDEN IN THERE SO WE

02:21:06.191 --> 02:21:10.028 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES CREATE THE PROBLEM

02:21:07.793 --> 02:21:11.396 region:rollup2
OURSELVES. SO WHEN IT COMES TO

02:21:10.028 --> 02:21:14.032 region:rollup2
REASONABLE STEPS.

02:21:11.396 --> 02:21:15.100 region:rollup2
WE HAD EARLIER BILL HERE TODAY

02:21:14.032 --> 02:21:16.902 region:rollup2
WERE HEADS ARE SIMILAR LANGUAGE

02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:17.769 region:rollup2
ABOUT REASONABLENESS AND I

02:21:16.902 --> 02:21:19.471 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP THE CONCEPT OF A SAFE

02:21:17.769 --> 02:21:20.872 region:rollup2
HARBOR MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN

02:21:19.471 --> 02:21:23.275 region:rollup2
THE BILL BUT THE NEED FOR ONE.

02:21:20.872 --> 02:21:23.875 region:rollup2
AND THIS DOESN'T HAVE WINE AND I

02:21:23.275 --> 02:21:25.310 region:rollup2
I JUST WANNA PLAY OUT A LITTLE

02:21:23.875 --> 02:21:26.978 region:rollup2
BIT.

02:21:25.310 --> 02:21:28.213 region:rollup2
HOW THIS PRACTICALLY HAPPENS IS

02:21:26.978 --> 02:21:29.614 region:rollup2
A COMPANY WILL NOW HAVE TO TRY

02:21:28.213 --> 02:21:32.017 region:rollup2
TO GAS

02:21:29.614 --> 02:21:33.752 region:rollup2
WHAT IS REASONABLE?

02:21:32.017 --> 02:21:34.753 region:rollup2
AND INEVITABLY THERE GONNA PUT

02:21:33.752 --> 02:21:36.054 region:rollup2
TIME AND MONEY AND EFFORT INTO

02:21:34.753 --> 02:21:38.690 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:21:36.054 --> 02:21:39.925 region:rollup2
AND WE WANT THEM TO DO SOME.

02:21:38.690 --> 02:21:42.361 region:rollup2
TIME AND MONEY AND EFFORT INTO

02:21:39.925 --> 02:21:43.795 region:rollup2
PROTECTING OUR KIDS BUT THEN THE

02:21:42.361 --> 02:21:46.231 region:rollup2
LITIGATION THAT COMES LATER IS

02:21:43.795 --> 02:21:47.899 region:rollup2
VERY VERY EXPENSIVE.

02:21:46.231 --> 02:21:50.102 region:rollup2
JUST TO DO A MOTION TO DISMISS

02:21:47.899 --> 02:21:50.769 region:rollup2
WHERE THE YOUNG WHICH THEY WILL

02:21:50.102 --> 02:21:52.070 region:rollup2
ALWAYS BE ABLE TO GET PAST

02:21:50.769 --> 02:21:53.805 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE. QUESTION OF

02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:55.006 region:rollup2
REASONABLE S. IS A FACT QUESTION

02:21:53.805 --> 02:21:56.274 region:rollup2
THAT THEN IS A SUMMARY JUDGMENT

02:21:55.006 --> 02:21:57.576 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

02:21:56.274 --> 02:21:58.977 region:rollup2
GUY AND GOD FORBID YOU ACTUALLY

02:21:57.576 --> 02:22:00.212 region:rollup2
GO TO TRIAL YOU'RE LOOKING AT

02:21:58.977 --> 02:22:01.413 region:rollup2
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

02:22:00.212 --> 02:22:02.881 region:rollup2
S. AND THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE A

02:22:01.413 --> 02:22:06.118 region:rollup2
CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. WHICH

02:22:02.881 --> 02:22:08.286 region:rollup2
DIVERTS RE RESOURCES AWAY FROM

02:22:06.118 --> 02:22:11.690 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY PUT IT

02:22:08.286 --> 02:22:14.159 region:rollup2
INTO THE BUSINESS AND COMPLY.

02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:15.494 region:rollup2
HAVING A SAFE HARBOR IS HELPFUL.

02:22:14.159 --> 02:22:16.728 region:rollup2
AYE AYE OF MY FIRST QUESTION BE

02:22:15.494 --> 02:22:18.296 region:rollup2
ARE YOU ARE YOU OPEN TO HAVING

02:22:16.728 --> 02:22:19.931 region:rollup2
SAFE HARBORS THAT.

02:22:18.296 --> 02:22:21.800 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T SAY THIS IS

02:22:19.931 --> 02:22:23.135 region:rollup2
THE ONE WAY MAYBE IT'S THE. SPIN

02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:24.870 region:rollup2
CLASS WHATEVER EXAMPLE BUT

02:22:23.135 --> 02:22:26.171 region:rollup2
HERE'S ONE WAY.

02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:28.974 region:rollup2
BUT THE SAFE HARBOR THE GIVES

02:22:26.171 --> 02:22:29.908 region:rollup2
COMPANIES SOME BASIS TO

02:22:28.974 --> 02:22:30.609 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WORKING EVEN HAVE A

02:22:29.908 --> 02:22:32.144 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCY A MORE EFFICIENT

02:22:30.609 --> 02:22:33.211 region:rollup2
STARTING POINT.

02:22:32.144 --> 02:22:35.614 region:rollup2
AND SECONDLY.

02:22:33.211 --> 02:22:37.349 region:rollup2
EVEN AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE

02:22:35.614 --> 02:22:38.917 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE KNOWING

02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:40.385 region:rollup2
THAT THE FROM A DEFENSE CAN BE

02:22:38.917 --> 02:22:41.653 region:rollup2
USED UNTIL AGAIN THE FACT

02:22:40.385 --> 02:22:43.021 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS HAPPENED SO A LOT OF

02:22:41.653 --> 02:22:44.956 region:rollup2
MONEY.

02:22:43.021 --> 02:22:45.624 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO STILL BE AN

02:22:44.956 --> 02:22:46.658 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE FOR BUSINESSES TO GET

02:22:45.624 --> 02:22:48.527 region:rollup2
IT RIGHT.

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:50.529 region:rollup2
CAN YOU COMMENT ON EITHER OF

02:22:48.527 --> 02:22:51.329 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO. POINTS

02:22:50.529 --> 02:22:52.764 region:rollup2
I HAVE YOU MORE AFTER THAT

02:22:51.329 --> 02:22:53.365 region:rollup2
FAILING TO TAKE A STAB AT IT AND

02:22:52.764 --> 02:22:55.467 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO

02:22:53.365 --> 02:22:56.368 region:rollup2
MISTER HOWARD. LA WOULD RESPECT

02:22:55.467 --> 02:22:57.936 region:rollup2
YOU FIRST QUESTION WHETHER OR

02:22:56.368 --> 02:22:59.571 region:rollup2
NOT DEL WE'RE OPEN TO HAVING

02:22:57.936 --> 02:23:01.606 region:rollup2
SAFE HARBORS IS DEFINITELY WHERE

02:22:59.571 --> 02:23:03.041 region:rollup2
TO FULLY OPEN TO. A NEGOTIATION

02:23:01.606 --> 02:23:05.544 region:rollup2
AND INCOME COMPOSITION WITH THE

02:23:03.041 --> 02:23:06.645 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO SLIDE OUT WHAT

02:23:05.544 --> 02:23:08.447 region:rollup2
THOSE SO YOU KNOW BASIC.

02:23:06.645 --> 02:23:09.114 region:rollup2
SAFE HARBORS WOULD BE CELLS ON

02:23:08.447 --> 02:23:10.782 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TOOK THAT'S TO ANSWER

02:23:09.114 --> 02:23:12.951 region:rollup2
YOUR QUESTION. NOW WITH RESPECT

02:23:10.782 --> 02:23:13.785 region:rollup2
TO THE AT THE TERM REASONABLE AS

02:23:12.951 --> 02:23:16.054 region:rollup2
I THINK I THINK.

02:23:13.785 --> 02:23:17.322 region:rollup2
LOW WE HAVE SEEN NO TIME AND

02:23:16.054 --> 02:23:19.424 region:rollup2
AGAIN DURING LITIGATION

02:23:17.322 --> 02:23:20.959 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE. OB THAT WE HAVE OUT

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:22.227 region:rollup2
WE USED A REASONABLE PERSON

02:23:20.959 --> 02:23:23.995 region:rollup2
STANDARD IN THE IN THE CASE OF

02:23:22.227 --> 02:23:25.764 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE SO I THINK YOU KNOW

02:23:23.995 --> 02:23:27.165 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE

02:23:25.764 --> 02:23:28.567 region:rollup2
A STANDARD IN PLACE I THINK.

02:23:27.165 --> 02:23:31.536 region:rollup2
LITIGATION THAT'S USE ALL THE

02:23:28.567 --> 02:23:32.637 region:rollup2
TIME SO I YOU KNOW AND FINAL

02:23:31.536 --> 02:23:34.940 region:rollup2
IMAGE YOU SEE THAT.

02:23:32.637 --> 02:23:36.274 region:rollup2
DEBATE THE BILL DOESN'T PROVIDE

02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:37.609 region:rollup2
A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:39.010 region:rollup2
NOW IT IS UP TO THE AG OR THE

02:23:37.609 --> 02:23:40.345 region:rollup2
DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO WOULD MAKE

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:40.879 region:rollup2
THAT DETERMINATION WHETHER OR

02:23:40.345 --> 02:23:42.113 region:rollup2
NOT TO BRING ABOUT TO THE

02:23:40.879 --> 02:23:44.249 region:rollup2
ACTION.

02:23:42.113 --> 02:23:45.917 region:rollup2
SO SO I'LL WHETHER NOT THEY WANT

02:23:44.249 --> 02:23:47.119 region:rollup2
TO USE REASONABLE STATE STANDARD

02:23:45.917 --> 02:23:48.687 region:rollup2
OR OTHERWISE I THINK YOU KNOW

02:23:47.119 --> 02:23:51.356 region:rollup2
BUT BUT. YOU KNOW THAT'S UP TO

02:23:48.687 --> 02:23:53.158 region:rollup2
THEM BUT YET I'M OPEN TO HAVING

02:23:51.356 --> 02:23:54.926 region:rollup2
GOT KIND OF A CONVERSATION AS TO

02:23:53.158 --> 02:23:56.128 region:rollup2
WHETHER NOT SAFE HARBOR WOULD BE

02:23:54.926 --> 02:23:57.896 region:rollup2
NEEDED MISS HOW. THE

02:23:56.128 --> 02:23:59.764 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR AT A FAMILY MEMBER AND

02:23:57.896 --> 02:24:00.632 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER IS YES CIVIL.

02:23:59.764 --> 02:24:03.201 region:rollup2
I LIKE.

02:24:00.632 --> 02:24:04.769 region:rollup2
SAFE HARBORS I THINK THAT THEY

02:24:03.201 --> 02:24:06.071 region:rollup2
STAY IF THEY'RE DONE PROPERLY.

02:24:04.769 --> 02:24:07.405 region:rollup2
STRIKE A REALLY WONDERFUL

02:24:06.071 --> 02:24:09.007 region:rollup2
BALANCE BETWEEN PROVIDING

02:24:07.405 --> 02:24:09.975 region:rollup2
REGULATED ENTITIES COMPLETE

02:24:09.007 --> 02:24:11.810 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY IN COMPLETING THEIR

02:24:09.975 --> 02:24:13.578 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR WITH THE LAW. BUT ALSO

02:24:11.810 --> 02:24:14.913 region:rollup2
FREEING REGULATED ENTITIES TO BE

02:24:13.578 --> 02:24:15.981 region:rollup2
ABLE TO INNOVATE IN WAYS THAT

02:24:14.913 --> 02:24:17.949 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE CONTEMPLATED BY THE

02:24:15.981 --> 02:24:19.384 region:rollup2
SAFE HARBOR SO I I LIKE MY ALSO

02:24:17.949 --> 02:24:20.619 region:rollup2
LIKE THE IDEAL THOUGH. OF AN

02:24:19.384 --> 02:24:21.953 region:rollup2
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE AGAIN

02:24:20.619 --> 02:24:25.323 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY CRAFTED.

02:24:21.953 --> 02:24:27.626 region:rollup2
IT COULD SERVE NOT TO PREVENT A

02:24:25.323 --> 02:24:28.527 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT BUT TO A BE ABLE TO

02:24:27.626 --> 02:24:29.761 region:rollup2
DISMISS ONE AT THE EARLIEST

02:24:28.527 --> 02:24:31.830 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY AT LEAST EXPENSE

02:24:29.761 --> 02:24:33.398 region:rollup2
ALSO NOTE. OF FOR THE RECORD

02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:34.466 region:rollup2
THAT NOT ONLY DOES THE BILL NOT

02:24:33.398 --> 02:24:36.034 region:rollup2
PROVIDE FOR A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

02:24:34.466 --> 02:24:38.103 region:rollup2
ACTION BUT THE MOST RECENT

02:24:36.034 --> 02:24:39.471 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS ELIMINATED. THE A

02:24:38.103 --> 02:24:41.540 region:rollup2
PROVISION OF THE BILL AS WAS

02:24:39.471 --> 02:24:42.107 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED THAT FORBADE

02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:43.675 region:rollup2
ARBITRAGE.

02:24:42.107 --> 02:24:46.645 region:rollup2
THAT FORBADE.

02:24:43.675 --> 02:24:47.913 region:rollup2
COMPANIES FROM.

02:24:46.645 --> 02:24:50.115 region:rollup2
FROM PROHIBITING PEOPLE FROM.

02:24:47.913 --> 02:24:51.449 region:rollup2
CLASSING UP INTO A CLASS.

02:24:50.115 --> 02:24:53.418 region:rollup2
SO INCREASINGLY THERE ARE

02:24:51.449 --> 02:24:56.388 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT ARE PUTTING IN

02:24:53.418 --> 02:24:57.989 region:rollup2
PROHIBITIONS. AGAINST PEOPLE.

02:24:56.388 --> 02:24:58.924 region:rollup2
ARE TEAMING UP IN A CLASS ACTION

02:24:57.989 --> 02:25:00.158 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY THE BILL HAD

02:24:58.924 --> 02:25:01.393 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT SAID YOU COULDN'T

02:25:00.158 --> 02:25:02.827 region:rollup2
DO THAT THAT LIKEWISE HAS BEEN

02:25:01.393 --> 02:25:03.828 region:rollup2
REMOVED. BUT ALSO SAID THE BILL

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:05.230 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THERE

02:25:03.828 --> 02:25:06.565 region:rollup2
CAN BE A CLASS ACTION OR THE

02:25:05.230 --> 02:25:07.632 region:rollup2
OTHER WAY AROUND OKAY HE I

02:25:06.565 --> 02:25:08.533 region:rollup2
WASN'T CLEAR ON WHAT YOU ARE

02:25:07.632 --> 02:25:11.303 region:rollup2
SAYING HOW THE OTHER WAY AROUND

02:25:08.533 --> 02:25:12.103 region:rollup2
PLEASE. THE THE ORIGINAL BILL OF

02:25:11.303 --> 02:25:14.973 region:rollup2
AS WAS INTRODUCED.

02:25:12.103 --> 02:25:17.042 region:rollup2
SAID THAT A COMPANY COULD NOT.

02:25:14.973 --> 02:25:19.044 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT PEOPLE.

02:25:17.042 --> 02:25:20.412 region:rollup2
FROM JOINING UP INTO A CLASS GOT

02:25:19.044 --> 02:25:21.046 region:rollup2
I'VE GOT A FEW MORE QUESTIONS I

02:25:20.412 --> 02:25:23.715 region:rollup2
THINK THAT SONG I THINK YOU AND

02:25:21.046 --> 02:25:25.150 region:rollup2
I. I DON'T WANT TO YES THERE IS

02:25:23.715 --> 02:25:26.518 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE STANDARD ALL

02:25:25.150 --> 02:25:28.486 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE LAW IT'S JUST

02:25:26.518 --> 02:25:29.888 region:rollup2
REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE TO

02:25:28.486 --> 02:25:31.489 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS AND

02:25:29.888 --> 02:25:33.191 region:rollup2
THESE ARE ALL RESOURCES GOING

02:25:31.489 --> 02:25:34.593 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM.

02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:35.594 region:rollup2
ENTERPRISES THAT ARE OTHERWISE

02:25:34.593 --> 02:25:37.128 region:rollup2
DOING LEGITIMATE WORK AND WE

02:25:35.594 --> 02:25:38.730 region:rollup2
DON'T WE WE DO PLENTY OF

02:25:37.128 --> 02:25:39.831 region:rollup2
CREATING THAT BURDEN ON THEM AND

02:25:38.730 --> 02:25:42.200 region:rollup2
I'M VERY GLAD THERE IS A POT AND

02:25:39.831 --> 02:25:43.535 region:rollup2
HERE. WOODEN UNDERVALUE THE FACT

02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:45.770 region:rollup2
THAT IF THE AG GETS TO DO THIS.

02:25:43.535 --> 02:25:47.472 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THAT'S.

02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:48.039 region:rollup2
JUST AS BAD BECAUSE THEN YOU'VE

02:25:47.472 --> 02:25:50.208 region:rollup2
GOT A CLAIM FROM AG AGAINST

02:25:48.039 --> 02:25:52.310 region:rollup2
YOUR.

02:25:50.208 --> 02:25:52.978 region:rollup2
YOUR BUSINESS AND TRYING TO

02:25:52.310 --> 02:25:55.046 region:rollup2

FOR BRING THE BILL AYE AYE.

02:31:11.663 --> 02:31:14.465 region:rollup2
FRANKLY.

02:31:11.930 --> 02:31:15.166 region:rollup2
THIS SUMMER BAKER ASK A LOT OF

02:31:14.465 --> 02:31:17.769 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD.

02:31:15.166 --> 02:31:19.137 region:rollup2
ME IN MY OFFICE ALSO HAD A LOT

02:31:17.769 --> 02:31:20.705 region:rollup2
OF CONFUSION AS TO WHO THE THE

02:31:19.137 --> 02:31:22.373 region:rollup2
BILL APPLIES TO.

02:31:20.705 --> 02:31:24.475 region:rollup2
BUT YOUR EXPLANATION.

02:31:22.373 --> 02:31:25.410 region:rollup2
AGAIN PROVIDED ANSWERS AND

02:31:24.475 --> 02:31:26.811 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ALSO CREATE A COUPLE

02:31:25.410 --> 02:31:28.513 region:rollup2
MORE QUESTIONS.

02:31:26.811 --> 02:31:32.016 region:rollup2
THAT WILL FOLLOW UP WITH.

02:31:28.513 --> 02:31:33.952 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU KNOW I I APPRECIATE

02:31:32.016 --> 02:31:35.787 region:rollup2
THE INTENTIONALITY WITH WHICH A

02:31:33.952 --> 02:31:35.987 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE THE CHANGES HAVE BEEN

02:31:35.787 --> 02:31:38.122 region:rollup2
MADE.

02:31:35.987 --> 02:31:39.557 region:rollup2
TO THE BILL I STILL THINK I AND

02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:41.359 region:rollup2
I AGREE THAT THE CURRENT

02:31:39.557 --> 02:31:42.794 region:rollup2
SITUATION IS INADEQUATE.

02:31:41.359 --> 02:31:44.996 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK.

02:31:42.794 --> 02:31:47.198 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OUR OUR POLICY IN OUR

02:31:44.996 --> 02:31:48.099 region:rollup2
LAWS MIGHT BE. WRITTEN CORRECT

02:31:47.198 --> 02:31:49.734 region:rollup2
BUT THE WAY THAT WE IMPLEMENT

02:31:48.099 --> 02:31:52.403 region:rollup2
THEM AREN'T.

02:31:49.734 --> 02:31:53.738 region:rollup2
AND SO BUT AT THE SAME TIME AND

02:31:52.403 --> 02:31:54.772 region:rollup2
I I DON'T TO BE A DEAD HORSE

02:31:53.738 --> 02:31:56.674 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF GOOD QUESTIONS

02:31:54.772 --> 02:31:58.176 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN RAISED AND FRANKLY

02:31:56.674 --> 02:32:01.012 region:rollup2
THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL HAS.

02:31:58.176 --> 02:32:02.680 region:rollup2
DE EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO

02:32:01.012 --> 02:32:04.282 region:rollup2
ADDRESS A LOT OF THE CONCERNS

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:06.150 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS.

02:32:04.282 --> 02:32:07.552 region:rollup2
AND IF THIS WERE BILL WERE TO

02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:08.753 region:rollup2
COME TO THE FLOOR WHEN SUPPORTED

02:32:07.552 --> 02:32:10.254 region:rollup2
IN ITS CURRENT FORM.

02:32:08.753 --> 02:32:11.656 region:rollup2
THE I THINK IT'S A GOOD

02:32:10.254 --> 02:32:13.758 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION TO HAVE.

02:32:11.656 --> 02:32:16.160 region:rollup2
I I THINK THAT THE GOALS THAT

02:32:13.758 --> 02:32:17.562 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE OUR AS.

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:19.731 region:rollup2
A MISTER MULLIN SAID RIGHTEOUS.

02:32:17.562 --> 02:32:20.498 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT

02:32:19.731 --> 02:32:22.433 region:rollup2
TERM TO USE.

02:32:20.498 --> 02:32:23.935 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THERE'S FAR TOO

02:32:22.433 --> 02:32:24.535 region:rollup2
MUCH AMBIGUITY CURRENTLY IN THE

02:32:23.935 --> 02:32:26.371 region:rollup2
BILL.

02:32:24.535 --> 02:32:28.473 region:rollup2
FOR MY COMPATIBILITY AS BEING

02:32:26.371 --> 02:32:28.973 region:rollup2
THE LAST STEP OR EVEN THE MIDDLE

02:32:28.473 --> 02:32:29.774 region:rollup2
STEP GETTING OUT OF THE

02:32:28.973 --> 02:32:31.676 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY.

02:32:29.774 --> 02:32:33.211 region:rollup2
.

02:32:31.676 --> 02:32:34.646 region:rollup2
I'M I'M COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO

02:32:33.211 --> 02:32:35.613 region:rollup2
HAVE THE CONVERSATION KEEP ON

02:32:34.646 --> 02:32:38.049 region:rollup2
GOING.

02:32:35.613 --> 02:32:40.018 region:rollup2
I REALLY DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE.

02:32:38.049 --> 02:32:42.086 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY THAT I DON'T THINK

02:32:40.018 --> 02:32:42.420 region:rollup2
IT'S ACCEPTABLE ON OF HAD A VERY

02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:44.922 region:rollup2
FINE.

02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:46.691 region:rollup2
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE CONVERSATIONS

02:32:44.922 --> 02:32:48.359 region:rollup2
WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE BILL.

02:32:46.691 --> 02:32:51.062 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN HOURS.

02:32:48.359 --> 02:32:52.997 region:rollup2
AND I I DON'T THINK IT'S

02:32:51.062 --> 02:32:54.365 region:rollup2
SATISFACTORY TO SAY WE LEAVE IT

02:32:52.997 --> 02:32:55.400 region:rollup2
UP TO TECH TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:32:54.365 --> 02:32:56.768 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT IT.

02:32:55.400 --> 02:32:57.969 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE

02:32:56.768 --> 02:32:59.203 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE.

02:32:57.969 --> 02:33:00.872 region:rollup2
YEAH I DON'T THINK TO BE

02:32:59.203 --> 02:33:02.407 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTIVE IN THE BILL BUT

02:33:00.872 --> 02:33:03.541 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE

02:33:02.407 --> 02:33:05.576 region:rollup2
CREATING LAWS THAT ARE

02:33:03.541 --> 02:33:06.711 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO TO IMPLEMENT

02:33:05.576 --> 02:33:08.179 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THOSE ARE JUST POISON

02:33:06.711 --> 02:33:09.447 region:rollup2
PILLS THAT ARE TRYING TO.

02:33:08.179 --> 02:33:11.182 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT ACTION.

02:33:09.447 --> 02:33:12.884 region:rollup2
GOT IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING.

02:33:11.182 --> 02:33:14.585 region:rollup2
AND SO.

02:33:12.884 --> 02:33:17.288 region:rollup2
I HAVE CONCERNS.

02:33:14.585 --> 02:33:19.524 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK IT'S YOU

02:33:17.288 --> 02:33:20.725 region:rollup2
KNOW THE AYE AYE. IT'S TRUE THAT

02:33:19.524 --> 02:33:22.026 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE

02:33:20.725 --> 02:33:23.828 region:rollup2
ENEMY OF THE GOOD AND AND IF

02:33:22.026 --> 02:33:25.463 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT AT A PERFECT STAGE AT

02:33:23.828 --> 02:33:26.698 region:rollup2
THIS POINT. LET'S FIND THE BEST.

02:33:25.463 --> 02:33:29.400 region:rollup2
WAY POSSIBLE.

02:33:26.698 --> 02:33:29.934 region:rollup2
SAID TO THE CHIEF THE POLICY

02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:31.102 region:rollup2
GOALS OF MAKING SURE THAT

02:33:29.934 --> 02:33:33.237 region:rollup2
MINERS.

02:33:31.102 --> 02:33:34.906 region:rollup2
IN A THEIR LIKENESSES AND USED

02:33:33.237 --> 02:33:36.607 region:rollup2
NOW FOR FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES

02:33:34.906 --> 02:33:39.377 region:rollup2
WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT. NOW

02:33:36.607 --> 02:33:42.213 region:rollup2
AND BE THAT THEY CAN'T ACQUIRE.

02:33:39.377 --> 02:33:43.181 region:rollup2
.ITEMS MOSTLY WEAPONS LE THAT WE

02:33:42.213 --> 02:33:45.349 region:rollup2
HAVE AGE RESTRICTIONS ON.

02:33:43.181 --> 02:33:46.184 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:48.086 region:rollup2
WORK TO BE DONE.

02:33:46.184 --> 02:33:48.820 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT TO IMPRESS UPON THE

02:33:48.086 --> 02:33:50.822 region:rollup2
AUTHOR.

TO TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRIES

02:33:50.822 --> 02:33:53.791 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED.

02:33:52.190 --> 02:33:55.760 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:56.561 region:rollup2
YEAH THEY HAVE A SEAT AT THE

02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:58.262 region:rollup2
TABLE AND AND.

02:33:56.561 --> 02:33:59.430 region:rollup2
CAN CAN IMPROVE THE CURRENT

02:33:58.262 --> 02:34:02.066 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE.

02:33:59.430 --> 02:34:03.201 region:rollup2

.

02:34:11.509 --> 02:34:13.945 region:rollup2
I MEAN I GUESS WE KNOW SOMEBODY

02:34:12.577 --> 02:34:16.280 region:rollup2

THAT IN TERMS OF THE THAT. THE

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:19.117 region:rollup2
PURCHASING ITEMS ONLINE THAT IT

02:34:17.982 --> 02:34:20.518 region:rollup2
EXTENDS BEYOND ITEMS WITH AIDS

02:34:19.117 --> 02:34:22.120 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS.

02:34:20.518 --> 02:34:23.988 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE

02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:25.656 region:rollup2

ALI HAVE COVERED THE UTMOST MY.

02:34:45.610 --> 02:34:49.313 region:rollup2

CREATE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER

02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:58.856 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN ONLINE.

02:34:56.854 --> 02:35:01.659 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE INTERNET HAS A

02:34:58.856 --> 02:35:03.861 region:rollup2
MANY PROMISES AND PITFALLS

02:35:01.659 --> 02:35:05.229 region:rollup2
PITFALLS FOR OUR CHILDREN AND

02:35:03.861 --> 02:35:08.432 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT AS LEGISLATORS WE

02:35:05.229 --> 02:35:10.768 region:rollup2
SEE HOW. A WEEKEND. ADDRESS OF

02:35:08.432 --> 02:35:11.135 region:rollup2
SO I I THINK YOUR GOALS ARE

02:35:10.768 --> 02:35:12.203 region:rollup2
LAUDABLE I HAVE.

02:35:11.135 --> 02:35:15.273 region:rollup2
.

02:35:12.203 --> 02:35:16.407 region:rollup2
STILL A NUMBER OF ISSUES OF WITH

02:35:15.273 --> 02:35:17.875 region:rollup2
THE BILL BUT I AM GOING TO

02:35:16.407 --> 02:35:19.443 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IT TODAY AND AND WE'LL

02:35:17.875 --> 02:35:22.580 region:rollup2
SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT

02:35:19.443 --> 02:35:23.648 region:rollup2
GETS ONTO THE FLOOR. AND TO A

02:35:22.580 --> 02:35:25.383 region:rollup2
KIND OF REPEAT WHAT MY

02:35:23.648 --> 02:35:27.552 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID I I HOPE

02:35:25.383 --> 02:35:28.519 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY

02:35:27.552 --> 02:35:30.454 region:rollup2
ENGAGE WITH THE.

02:35:28.519 --> 02:35:31.989 region:rollup2
RETAILERS AND SOCIAL MEDIA

02:35:30.454 --> 02:35:33.491 region:rollup2
WEBSITES

02:35:31.989 --> 02:35:34.859 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE REAL

02:35:33.491 --> 02:35:37.094 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES.

02:35:34.859 --> 02:35:38.396 region:rollup2
WITH THE AGE VERIFICATION AND

02:35:37.094 --> 02:35:40.131 region:rollup2
AND I DO THINK IT'S VERY

02:35:38.396 --> 02:35:41.732 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND.

02:35:40.131 --> 02:35:44.969 region:rollup2
WITH TECH LAW HAVE OF

02:35:41.732 --> 02:35:46.370 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY. BUT THERE ALSO HAS

02:35:44.969 --> 02:35:48.172 region:rollup2
TO BE AT LEAST WE HAVE TO SEE AT

02:35:46.370 --> 02:35:49.640 region:rollup2
LEAST ONE REASONABLE WAY TO

02:35:48.172 --> 02:35:50.708 region:rollup2
PERFORM.

02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:52.877 region:rollup2
THE FUNCTION.

02:35:50.708 --> 02:35:55.947 region:rollup2
THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE DON'T

02:35:52.877 --> 02:35:58.182 region:rollup2
FIND OFFENSIVE AND SO YOU KNOW I

02:35:55.947 --> 02:36:00.985 region:rollup2
JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS.

02:35:58.182 --> 02:36:02.587 region:rollup2
I'D THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT

02:36:00.985 --> 02:36:06.524 region:rollup2
HAVING TO USE LET'S SAY. OF

02:36:02.587 --> 02:36:10.261 region:rollup2
PASSPORTS OR OR OTHER TYPE OF.

02:36:06.524 --> 02:36:11.829 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTATION TO PROVE AGE OUT

02:36:10.261 --> 02:36:13.564 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO GET INTO THAT AREA WE

02:36:11.829 --> 02:36:15.800 region:rollup2
DO NOT WANT THE SOCIAL MEDIA

02:36:13.564 --> 02:36:17.768 region:rollup2
COMPANIES OR ONLINE RETAILERS

02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:19.871 region:rollup2
HOLDING ANYMORE OF OUR PRIVATE

02:36:17.768 --> 02:36:21.772 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SO I THINK ALL THAT

02:36:19.871 --> 02:36:24.408 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED. AND WE

02:36:21.772 --> 02:36:27.078 region:rollup2
NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE IS A

02:36:24.408 --> 02:36:29.480 region:rollup2
THAT A PATH FORWARD. TO DO THIS

02:36:27.078 --> 02:36:30.881 region:rollup2
AND SO ALL OF THE AS I SAID I I

02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:32.383 region:rollup2
WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT

02:36:30.881 --> 02:36:33.851 region:rollup2
I NEED TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

02:36:32.383 --> 02:36:35.052 region:rollup2
WHEN IT GETS TO THE FLOOR.

02:36:33.851 --> 02:36:37.288 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR IMAGE.

02:36:42.126 --> 02:36:45.029 region:rollup2
SOME CONCERNS THAT I JUST RAISE

02:36:43.661 --> 02:36:46.731 region:rollup2
THE ONES THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD

02:36:45.029 --> 02:36:47.765 region:rollup2
REYES SO FAR SO YOU'VE YOU'VE

02:36:46.731 --> 02:36:49.533 region:rollup2
GOT THE BILL DIVIDED INTO TWO

02:36:47.765 --> 02:36:51.269 region:rollup2
SECTIONS YOU'VE GOT SECTION A.

02:36:49.533 --> 02:36:52.370 region:rollup2
THE DEALS WITH ENDORSEMENTS AND

02:36:51.269 --> 02:36:54.605 region:rollup2
SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES AND

02:36:52.370 --> 02:36:55.439 region:rollup2
SECTION BE THAT DEALS WITH THE

02:36:54.605 --> 02:36:57.341 region:rollup2
SHIPMENT OF PHYSICAL GOODS TO

02:36:55.439 --> 02:36:58.743 region:rollup2
MINORS. AND I REALLY WISH THAT

02:36:57.341 --> 02:36:59.844 region:rollup2
YOUHAD JUST SEPARATED THEM AND

02:36:58.743 --> 02:37:01.646 region:rollup2
DETERMINE TWO SEPARATE BILLS

02:36:59.844 --> 02:37:04.181 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE.

02:37:01.646 --> 02:37:05.616 region:rollup2
SECTION BE IS A LOT BETTER

02:37:04.181 --> 02:37:06.584 region:rollup2
BATES THAN SECTION A.

02:37:05.616 --> 02:37:08.386 region:rollup2
I OUGHT SOMEONE OF JUST FOCUS ON

02:37:06.584 --> 02:37:09.687 region:rollup2
SECTION A BECAUSE I GOT SOME

02:37:08.386 --> 02:37:10.821 region:rollup2
SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND

02:37:09.687 --> 02:37:12.490 region:rollup2
THAT THE REASON WHY I'M SO

02:37:10.821 --> 02:37:14.125 region:rollup2
CONCERNED IS THAT WE CAN TALK

02:37:12.490 --> 02:37:15.893 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE.

02:37:14.125 --> 02:37:17.161 region:rollup2
HERE WHEN WE CRAFTED BILL BUT

02:37:15.893 --> 02:37:18.462 region:rollup2
THE WORDING OF THE BILL IS

02:37:17.161 --> 02:37:19.964 region:rollup2
CRITICAL BECAUSE ONCE IT GETS

02:37:18.462 --> 02:37:20.965 region:rollup2
OUT INTO THE WILD THE COURTS ARE

02:37:19.964 --> 02:37:21.899 region:rollup2
GOING TO INTERPRET IT BASED ON

02:37:20.965 --> 02:37:23.801 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WROTE THEY'RE NOT WHAT

02:37:21.899 --> 02:37:25.303 region:rollup2
OUR INTENTIONS WERE. AND SO IT'S

02:37:23.801 --> 02:37:25.803 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT WE GET IT RIGHT

02:37:25.303 --> 02:37:27.371 region:rollup2
AND.

02:37:25.803 --> 02:37:28.406 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE'S A

02:37:27.371 --> 02:37:29.707 region:rollup2
LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE STILL

02:37:28.406 --> 02:37:30.174 region:rollup2
THURMOND FIRST OF ALL WE TALKED

02:37:29.707 --> 02:37:31.709 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

02:37:30.174 --> 02:37:33.244 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF A SOCIAL MEDIA

02:37:31.709 --> 02:37:34.845 region:rollup2
WEBSITE. I DEFINITELY THINK IT'S

02:37:33.244 --> 02:37:36.047 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO NAIL THAT DOWN

02:37:34.845 --> 02:37:37.915 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF WHAT MIGHT BE OBVIOUS

02:37:36.047 --> 02:37:39.517 region:rollup2
TO US SITTING HERE WHAT WE MEAN

02:37:37.915 --> 02:37:42.019 region:rollup2
BY SOCIAL MEDIA AND WEBSITE IS

02:37:39.517 --> 02:37:43.654 region:rollup2
NOT OBVIOUS TO. OUR PEOPLE WHO

02:37:42.019 --> 02:37:44.989 region:rollup2
ARE DESIGNING WEBSITES ARE GIVEN

02:37:43.654 --> 02:37:46.390 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN PERSONAL

02:37:44.989 --> 02:37:48.292 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW I RUN A.

02:37:46.390 --> 02:37:49.560 region:rollup2
VIDEO GAME DEVELOPMENT STUDIO

02:37:48.292 --> 02:37:51.495 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO WE HAVE LEADER BOARDS.

02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:52.863 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU POST YOUR HIGH SCORES

02:37:51.495 --> 02:37:53.431 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE HOW YOU RANK

02:37:52.863 --> 02:37:55.533 region:rollup2
COMPARED WITH ALL THE OTHER

02:37:53.431 --> 02:37:57.501 region:rollup2
PLAYERS OF THE GAME?

02:37:55.533 --> 02:37:59.236 region:rollup2
IS THAT A SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE.

02:37:57.501 --> 02:38:00.404 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT A CASUAL OBSERVER

02:37:59.236 --> 02:38:02.406 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY NO BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY

02:38:00.404 --> 02:38:03.040 region:rollup2
LOOK AT A DEFINITION I THINK YOU

02:38:02.406 --> 02:38:04.208 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT. MAYBE IT

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:06.310 region:rollup2
IS.

02:38:04.208 --> 02:38:08.279 region:rollup2
ARE WE YOU DON'T DEFINE REALLY

02:38:06.310 --> 02:38:09.847 region:rollup2
ARE HOW. A.

02:38:08.279 --> 02:38:11.916 region:rollup2
WEBSITE PROPRIETORS SUPPOSED TO

02:38:09.847 --> 02:38:12.650 region:rollup2
KNOW WHEN A MINOR HAS ENTERED

02:38:11.916 --> 02:38:14.518 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

02:38:12.650 --> 02:38:16.220 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

02:38:14.518 --> 02:38:17.521 region:rollup2
SO OUR GIVEN EXAMPLE LIKE THE

02:38:16.220 --> 02:38:20.124 region:rollup2
LEADER BOARD EXAMPLE.

02:38:17.521 --> 02:38:21.225 region:rollup2
USERS ENTER A USER NAME OR

02:38:20.124 --> 02:38:22.827 region:rollup2
HANDLE THAT THEY WANT POSTED ON

02:38:21.225 --> 02:38:24.428 region:rollup2
THERE WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING

02:38:22.827 --> 02:38:25.930 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT. THAT YOUR REAL

02:38:24.428 --> 02:38:27.932 region:rollup2
NAME THEM IN SOME CASES IT'S

02:38:25.930 --> 02:38:29.300 region:rollup2
OBVIOUS IT'S NOT. WE HAVE TO

02:38:27.932 --> 02:38:31.569 region:rollup2
REGULARLY POLICE THOSE FOR FOUR

02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:32.903 region:rollup2
LETTER WORDS AND ANATOMICAL

02:38:31.569 --> 02:38:33.938 region:rollup2
REFERENCES RIGHT.

02:38:32.903 --> 02:38:35.039 region:rollup2
A PRETTY CLEAR THAT THAT'S NOT

02:38:33.938 --> 02:38:36.474 region:rollup2
THE REAL NAY BUT SOME PEOPLE PUT

02:38:35.039 --> 02:38:37.708 region:rollup2
THEIR REAL NAMES ARE WE HAVE NO

02:38:36.474 --> 02:38:39.477 region:rollup2
WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT.

02:38:37.708 --> 02:38:41.412 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT'S A REAL NAME AND

02:38:39.477 --> 02:38:43.881 region:rollup2
THEN ARE ALSO IN SECTION I

02:38:41.412 --> 02:38:45.616 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE INTENTION IS TO.

02:38:43.881 --> 02:38:48.052 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT AN ENDORSEMENT TYPE OF

02:38:45.616 --> 02:38:49.920 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BUT THE WORDING.

02:38:48.052 --> 02:38:51.956 region:rollup2
REALLY DOESN'T SAY THAT BECAUSE

02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:53.791 region:rollup2
ALL IT SAYS IS THAT. IF ANYONE

02:38:51.956 --> 02:38:55.359 region:rollup2
GETS PAID FOR THE DISPLAY OF

02:38:53.791 --> 02:38:56.861 region:rollup2
THAT USERS PERSONALLY

02:38:55.359 --> 02:38:58.863 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.

02:38:56.861 --> 02:39:00.031 region:rollup2
THEN THAT IS ILLEGAL AND FRANKLY

02:38:58.863 --> 02:39:01.432 region:rollup2
THAT THAT COVERS A LOT BROADER

02:39:00.031 --> 02:39:02.666 region:rollup2
FIELD THAN JUST AN ENDORSEMENT

02:39:01.432 --> 02:39:04.568 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP I MEAN IF WE HAVE A

02:39:02.666 --> 02:39:06.170 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH. A ANOTHER

02:39:04.568 --> 02:39:07.505 region:rollup2
COMPANY AT THAT IS A PORTAL FOR

02:39:06.170 --> 02:39:09.140 region:rollup2
OUR INFORMATION AND THEY DISPLAY

02:39:07.505 --> 02:39:10.274 region:rollup2
OUR LEADER BOARDS INITIATES IN

02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:11.542 region:rollup2
EXCHANGE FOR THAT.

02:39:10.274 --> 02:39:12.843 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO PUT AN AD FOR OUR

02:39:11.542 --> 02:39:13.711 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS

02:39:12.843 --> 02:39:14.812 region:rollup2
RIGHT WE ARE ESSENTIALLY GETTING

02:39:13.711 --> 02:39:16.313 region:rollup2
PAID BECAUSE WERE RECEIVING

02:39:14.812 --> 02:39:18.015 region:rollup2
SOMETHING OF VALUE THE

02:39:16.313 --> 02:39:19.283 region:rollup2
ADVERTISEMENT. AND THEY'RE

02:39:18.015 --> 02:39:20.851 region:rollup2
DISPLAYING THEIR PERSONAL HERE

02:39:19.283 --> 02:39:21.952 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION EVEN

02:39:20.851 --> 02:39:23.687 region:rollup2
THOUGH NO ENDORSEMENT

02:39:21.952 --> 02:39:26.424 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP AS IMPLIED IT'S

02:39:23.687 --> 02:39:28.359 region:rollup2
STILL IN VIOLATION OF THE BILL.

02:39:26.424 --> 02:39:29.727 region:rollup2
BOB DYLAN IN ABOUT MY LAST.

02:39:28.359 --> 02:39:31.228 region:rollup2
KIND OF OUR CONSTRUCTIVE

02:39:29.727 --> 02:39:33.864 region:rollup2
CRITICISM FOR YOU IS.

02:39:31.228 --> 02:39:35.332 region:rollup2
THAT SECTION A UNLIKE SECTION BE

02:39:33.864 --> 02:39:37.268 region:rollup2
DOES NOT HAVE A REASON ABILITY

02:39:35.332 --> 02:39:38.502 region:rollup2
CLAUSE IN IT. IN OTHER WORDS

02:39:37.268 --> 02:39:40.004 region:rollup2
IT'S ALL A SECTION NAY SAYS IS

02:39:38.502 --> 02:39:42.573 region:rollup2
IF.

02:39:40.004 --> 02:39:43.674 region:rollup2
ARE IF A SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE

02:39:42.573 --> 02:39:45.209 region:rollup2
DISPLAYS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

02:39:43.674 --> 02:39:45.910 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

02:39:45.209 --> 02:39:47.344 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN ENDORSEMENT

02:39:45.910 --> 02:39:49.113 region:rollup2
ATMOSPHERE ALL THE MINOR THEN

02:39:47.344 --> 02:39:50.948 region:rollup2
THEY ARE GUILTY.

02:39:49.113 --> 02:39:52.683 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND EVEN IF THE MINOR TOLD

02:39:50.948 --> 02:39:54.051 region:rollup2
THEM I'M NOT A MINOR. IN SECTION

02:39:52.683 --> 02:39:55.319 region:rollup2
BE SAYS THAT THERE IS THERE'S A

02:39:54.051 --> 02:39:57.021 region:rollup2
REASON ABILITY THING IF IF IF

02:39:55.319 --> 02:39:59.056 region:rollup2
THEY TOOK REASONABLE STEPS TO

02:39:57.021 --> 02:40:01.025 region:rollup2
TRY TO VERIFY. THAT THAT PERSON

02:39:59.056 --> 02:40:01.959 region:rollup2
WHO WAS A MINOR WAS NOT A MINOR

02:40:01.025 --> 02:40:03.861 region:rollup2
THAN THAN.

02:40:01.959 --> 02:40:05.296 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL EXPECTED OF THEM BUT

02:40:03.861 --> 02:40:07.264 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT IN SECTION A.

02:40:05.296 --> 02:40:08.466 region:rollup2
AND SO ARE. YOU KNOW IT AT THE

02:40:07.264 --> 02:40:09.934 region:rollup2
VERY LEAST I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU

02:40:08.466 --> 02:40:10.835 region:rollup2
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT AGAIN

02:40:09.934 --> 02:40:12.503 region:rollup2
I REALLY WISH THAT YOU'D

02:40:10.835 --> 02:40:14.171 region:rollup2
SEPARATED THE TWO BECAUSE. IT

02:40:12.503 --> 02:40:15.439 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A LOT EASIER FOR ME TO

02:40:14.171 --> 02:40:16.807 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IT IF IF THIS WAS JUST

02:40:15.439 --> 02:40:18.242 region:rollup2
SECTION BE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

02:40:16.807 --> 02:40:19.710 region:rollup2
AND NOT SECTION NAY JUST BECAUSE

02:40:18.242 --> 02:40:21.212 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS LIKE SECTION BE IS A

02:40:19.710 --> 02:40:22.880 region:rollup2
LOT FURTHER ALONG.

02:40:21.212 --> 02:40:24.048 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND

02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:25.916 region:rollup2
YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN WILL

02:40:24.048 --> 02:40:27.384 region:rollup2
LOOK INTO IT AND SEE SEE HOW ARE

02:40:25.916 --> 02:40:28.018 region:rollup2
WE CAN APPROACH IT. THE REASON

02:40:27.384 --> 02:40:30.121 region:rollup2
WHY WE.

02:40:28.018 --> 02:40:31.522 region:rollup2
HAD PULLED A HIPPIE IN ONE BILL

02:40:30.121 --> 02:40:32.923 region:rollup2
WAS BECAUSE I AYE WE THOUGHT

02:40:31.522 --> 02:40:33.791 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMMON THREAD WAS THE

02:40:32.923 --> 02:40:35.893 region:rollup2
CONSENT PIECE

02:40:33.791 --> 02:40:37.561 region:rollup2
PARENTAL CONSENT SO. SO THAT'S

02:40:35.893 --> 02:40:39.563 region:rollup2
WHAT TIED TO TWO PIECES TOGETHER

02:40:37.561 --> 02:40:41.265 region:rollup2
ARE INDEED BOTH DON'T DEAL WITH

02:40:39.563 --> 02:40:43.000 region:rollup2
A SOCIAL MEDIA OUR WEBSITES IN

02:40:41.265 --> 02:40:45.069 region:rollup2
GENERAL SO WE THOUGHT IT WOULD

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:46.103 region:rollup2
BE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO DO. YOU

02:40:45.069 --> 02:40:48.205 region:rollup2
KNOW BOTH CONCEPTS IN IN JUST

02:40:46.103 --> 02:40:49.006 region:rollup2
ONE BILL. BUT WILL YOU DON'T LAW

02:40:48.205 --> 02:40:50.574 region:rollup2
GO FORWARD TO WILL BE HAPPY TO

02:40:49.006 --> 02:40:52.409 region:rollup2
KIND AYE RECONCILED THE YOU KNOW

02:40:50.574 --> 02:40:54.011 region:rollup2
BOTH A AND B. AND AND SEE HOW WE

02:40:52.409 --> 02:40:55.646 region:rollup2
CAN KIND. OF MAKE SENSE MAKE

02:40:54.011 --> 02:40:56.213 region:rollup2
MORE SENSE.

02:40:55.646 --> 02:40:56.881 region:rollup2
TO THE BILL AS WE GO ALONG

02:40:56.213 --> 02:41:00.184 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:40:56.881 --> 02:41:02.753 region:rollup2
ANYONE ELSE.

02:41:00.184 --> 02:41:04.088 region:rollup2
SO I LIKE MR OBERNOLTE HIGH MASS

02:41:02.753 --> 02:41:04.421 region:rollup2
MORE SYMPATHETIC TO THE SECOND

02:41:04.088 --> 02:41:06.190 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS.

02:41:04.421 --> 02:41:07.491 region:rollup2
.

02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:09.927 region:rollup2
A QUESTION ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY

02:41:07.491 --> 02:41:10.427 region:rollup2
SO CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN HOW THE I

02:41:09.927 --> 02:41:12.196 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IS THAT AGE

02:41:10.427 --> 02:41:13.564 region:rollup2
VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR ALCOHOL

02:41:12.196 --> 02:41:15.099 region:rollup2
PURCHASES ONLINE.

02:41:13.564 --> 02:41:17.034 region:rollup2
THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS HOW DOES

02:41:15.099 --> 02:41:18.536 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THAT WORK AND HOW IT

02:41:17.034 --> 02:41:19.870 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE

02:41:18.536 --> 02:41:22.072 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ANYWAY.

02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:22.573 region:rollup2
IT.

02:41:22.072 --> 02:41:23.874 region:rollup2
ITS CHAIRMAN.

02:41:22.573 --> 02:41:25.976 region:rollup2
AT HOWARD JEWELERS ETHICS

02:41:23.874 --> 02:41:27.578 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE I'M SO THE AGE

02:41:25.976 --> 02:41:29.380 region:rollup2
VERIFICATION THAT HAPPENS WITH

02:41:27.578 --> 02:41:30.981 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL MOST COMMONLY HAPPENS

02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:33.417 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY THROUGH THE INTERNET.

02:41:30.981 --> 02:41:34.652 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO WHEN ALCOHOL WAS

02:41:33.417 --> 02:41:35.886 region:rollup2
DELIVERED.

02:41:34.652 --> 02:41:37.721 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE SOMEBODY WHOSE

02:41:35.886 --> 02:41:39.857 region:rollup2
IDEAS CHECK BEFORE THEY CAN SIGN

02:41:37.721 --> 02:41:42.626 region:rollup2
FOR IT. IN THE WITNESSES

02:41:39.857 --> 02:41:45.362 region:rollup2
SITUATION THE BOX WEAPONS FROM

02:41:42.626 --> 02:41:46.497 region:rollup2
AMAZON SHOWED UP DESTRUCT. IT

02:41:45.362 --> 02:41:48.098 region:rollup2
WAS ON YOUR DOORSTEP OF ARTICLE

02:41:46.497 --> 02:41:49.967 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU CAME HOME FROM LUNCH SO

02:41:48.098 --> 02:41:51.702 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NO REQUIREMENT. THAT

02:41:49.967 --> 02:41:53.304 region:rollup2
ANYBODY WHO IS EVEN POTENTIALLY

02:41:51.702 --> 02:41:55.072 region:rollup2
QUITE UPSIDE FOR BUT THAT'S.

02:41:53.304 --> 02:41:57.942 region:rollup2
THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT.

02:41:55.072 --> 02:41:59.810 region:rollup2
TO A LOT OF THE POINTS RAISED.

02:41:57.942 --> 02:42:01.912 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY HERE IN THE COMMITTEE

02:41:59.810 --> 02:42:03.881 region:rollup2
HEARING IT DOESN'T PRESCRIBE ANY

02:42:01.912 --> 02:42:05.015 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR METHOD OF DOING SO

02:42:03.881 --> 02:42:06.450 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S THE WAY THAT AGE

02:42:05.015 --> 02:42:07.885 region:rollup2
VERIFICATION IS HANDLED WOOD

02:42:06.450 --> 02:42:08.919 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL IT IS NOT.

02:42:07.885 --> 02:42:10.654 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW IS CLEARLY

02:42:08.919 --> 02:42:12.823 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE.

02:42:10.654 --> 02:42:14.291 region:rollup2
TO THE. TO THE TASK OF REQUIRING

02:42:12.823 --> 02:42:17.328 region:rollup2
SOMETHING EVEN REMOTELY

02:42:14.291 --> 02:42:18.128 region:rollup2
COMPARABLE FOR FIREARMS OR OTHER

02:42:17.328 --> 02:42:19.263 region:rollup2
ITEMS THEIR LEGAL ASSEMBLY

02:42:18.128 --> 02:42:20.998 region:rollup2
CHILDREN YES EVERY OPPOSITION

02:42:19.263 --> 02:42:22.333 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT WOULD BE THE THE

02:42:20.998 --> 02:42:23.667 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH SUBJECTING THESE

02:42:22.333 --> 02:42:24.868 region:rollup2
SINISTER LOOKING ITEMS.

02:42:23.667 --> 02:42:26.770 region:rollup2
TO THE SAME.

02:42:24.868 --> 02:42:31.141 region:rollup2
PROCESS AS WE CURRENTLY

02:42:26.770 --> 02:42:32.943 region:rollup2
FROGHALL.

02:42:31.141 --> 02:42:34.245 region:rollup2
WELL PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT

02:42:32.943 --> 02:42:36.413 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL.

02:42:34.245 --> 02:42:37.581 region:rollup2
TALKS ABOUT VERIFYING THE AGE

02:42:36.413 --> 02:42:38.816 region:rollup2
OF THE PERSON PURCHASE ARE AT

02:42:37.581 --> 02:42:40.384 region:rollup2
THE POINT OF SALE.

02:42:38.816 --> 02:42:42.319 region:rollup2
SO RIGHT THERE THERE'S

02:42:40.384 --> 02:42:43.687 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES OF HOUSE SOMEONE HOW

02:42:42.319 --> 02:42:45.155 region:rollup2
A COMPANY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO

02:42:43.687 --> 02:42:47.057 region:rollup2
THAT AND I THINK A LOT OF THOSE

02:42:45.155 --> 02:42:49.026 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WERE RAISED.

02:42:47.057 --> 02:42:50.961 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE THE

02:42:49.026 --> 02:42:52.796 region:rollup2

A FEW DAYS AGO AND AGAIN THIS IS

02:42:54.031 --> 02:42:56.734 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT A HUGE CHANGE IN

02:42:55.399 --> 02:42:58.669 region:rollup2
THE MARKETPLACE WE STILL NEED.

02:42:56.734 --> 02:43:00.170 region:rollup2
TIME TO EXPLORE THE

02:42:58.669 --> 02:43:00.404 region:rollup2
RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT.

02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:02.139 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

02:43:00.404 --> 02:43:03.340 region:rollup2

.

02:43:05.342 --> 02:43:08.145 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A COPY LIKE WE NEED

02:43:06.677 --> 02:43:09.179 region:rollup2
TO EXPLORE WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN

02:43:08.145 --> 02:43:11.048 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A COMPANY THAT HAS A

02:43:09.179 --> 02:43:12.916 region:rollup2
POLICY OF WE DON'T. DELIVER

02:43:11.048 --> 02:43:13.884 region:rollup2
THESE ITEMS TO SOMEBODY UNLESS

02:43:12.916 --> 02:43:15.152 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A SIGNATURE AND THEN

02:43:13.884 --> 02:43:16.720 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A DELIVERY COMPANY THAT

02:43:15.152 --> 02:43:18.455 region:rollup2
DOES THAT ANYWAY. WHO'S GONNA BE

02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:19.857 region:rollup2
LIABLE JUST THINGS LIKE THAT WE

02:43:18.455 --> 02:43:21.525 region:rollup2

SITUATION I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON

02:43:22.926 --> 02:43:25.729 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL REGULATION BUT IT'S I

02:43:24.395 --> 02:43:27.665 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S VERY HEAVILY REGULATED

02:43:25.729 --> 02:43:29.266 region:rollup2
ALREADY. AND SO THEY ARE TO COME

02:43:27.665 --> 02:43:30.801 region:rollup2
TO THE TABLE WITH A SIGNIFICANT

02:43:29.266 --> 02:43:31.869 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF OVERSIGHT.

02:43:30.801 --> 02:43:33.170 region:rollup2
AND THEY'VE ALREADY SPENT A

02:43:31.869 --> 02:43:34.638 region:rollup2
LONG TIME FIGURING OUT HOW TO

02:43:33.170 --> 02:43:35.773 region:rollup2
MAKE THOSE RULES WORK THIS IS

02:43:34.638 --> 02:43:37.341 region:rollup2
KIND OF STARTING FROM SCRATCH

02:43:35.773 --> 02:43:38.575 region:rollup2
INTO THAT NEEDS TO BE REFLECTED

02:43:37.341 --> 02:43:39.943 region:rollup2
IN THIS BILL WITH RESPECT TO IF

IMPLEMENTATION THAT SORT OF

02:43:40.978 --> 02:43:45.049 region:rollup2
THING. LOTS OF THINGS WE NEED TO

02:43:42.713 --> 02:43:46.216 region:rollup2

02:43:48.052 --> 02:43:50.754 region:rollup2
WOULD HOPE THAT.

02:43:49.687 --> 02:43:52.389 region:rollup2
WE CAN AT LEAST USE THAT AS A

02:43:50.754 --> 02:43:54.358 region:rollup2
REFERENCE POINT FOR DEVELOPING

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:55.893 region:rollup2
