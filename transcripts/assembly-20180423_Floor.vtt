00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:07.678 region:rollup2
MOTHERS?

00:49:07.178 --> 00:49:10.548 region:rollup2
SISTERS AND BROTHERS IN

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:11.949 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

00:49:10.548 --> 00:49:13.584 region:rollup2
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ARMENIAN

00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:14.718 region:rollup2
LIVES WERE LOST

00:49:13.584 --> 00:49:16.287 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:17.888 region:rollup2
ASSYRIANS GREEKS HAD OTHER

00:49:16.287 --> 00:49:19.857 region:rollup2
CHRISTIANS PERISHED IN ONE OF

00:49:17.888 --> 00:49:21.559 region:rollup2
THE MOST ATROCIOUS VIOLATIONS OF

00:49:19.857 --> 00:49:24.128 region:rollup2
HUMAN RIGHTS HISTORY.

00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:26.797 region:rollup2
THIS WAS THE FIRST GENOCIDE.

00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:28.365 region:rollup2
TWENTIETH CENTURY.

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:30.201 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN MOST

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:32.603 region:rollup2
ARMENIANS KNEW SOMEBODY WHO WAS

00:49:30.201 --> 00:49:34.271 region:rollup2
A THEMSELVES OR SURVIVOR. OR A

00:49:32.603 --> 00:49:35.739 region:rollup2
DIRECT DESCENDANT OF A SURVIVOR

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:37.775 region:rollup2
BUT NOW THAT WERE A HUNDRED AND

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:39.577 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE YEARS LATER.

00:49:37.775 --> 00:49:41.779 region:rollup2
THOSE SURVIVORS THEMSELVES OF

00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:43.481 region:rollup2
COURSE ARE FADING.

00:49:41.779 --> 00:49:44.615 region:rollup2
AND IN SOME CASES THE MEMORIES

00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:47.017 region:rollup2
OF THAT GENOCIDE.

00:49:44.615 --> 00:49:48.018 region:rollup2
FADING.

00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:49.687 region:rollup2
BUT NOT AMONGST THE ARMENIAN

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:50.988 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

00:49:49.687 --> 00:49:53.157 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE OF OUR WORK NOT

00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:54.458 region:rollup2
HEARING CALIFORNIA.

00:49:53.157 --> 00:49:55.893 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY A HUNDRED AND THREE

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:57.761 region:rollup2
YEARS LATER WE ARE HERE ON THE

00:49:55.893 --> 00:49:59.330 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY FLOOR TODAY TO REMEMBER

00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:00.497 region:rollup2
THOSE LIVES LOST.

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:01.298 region:rollup2
THOSE HOPES THOSE DREAMS THOSE

00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:03.767 region:rollup2
LOVES.

00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:05.469 region:rollup2
ALL.

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:06.270 region:rollup2
TAKEN AWAY DURING THIS VERY DARK

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:08.539 region:rollup2
PERIOD IN TWENTIETH CENTURY

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:10.207 region:rollup2
HISTORY.

00:50:08.539 --> 00:50:11.375 region:rollup2
AS WE PAY OUR SOLEMN TRIBUTE TO

00:50:10.207 --> 00:50:12.943 region:rollup2
THE VICTIMS OF THESE UNSPEAKABLE

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:14.745 region:rollup2
CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. LET'S

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:16.914 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THAT WERE ALSO HERE TO

RENEW OUR VOW.

00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:20.551 region:rollup2
TO NEVER LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:22.219 region:rollup2
TO NEVER BE THE BYSTANDER THAT

00:50:20.551 --> 00:50:24.421 region:rollup2
STANDS IDLY BY. AS GENOCIDE

00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:25.589 region:rollup2
HAPPENS.

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:27.258 region:rollup2
AS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY IN

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:28.592 region:rollup2
ELECTED LEADERS IT'S OUR DUTY TO

00:50:27.258 --> 00:50:30.261 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT OUR NATION AND OUR

00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:32.396 region:rollup2
WORLD RECOGNIZE THE GENOCIDE FOR

00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:33.764 region:rollup2
WHAT IT WAS.

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:34.865 region:rollup2
DENYING THE ATROCITIES ARE

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:37.434 region:rollup2
REMAINING SILENT INVITES

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:39.169 region:rollup2
REOCCURRENCE.

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:40.070 region:rollup2
OUR MODERN HISTORY IS SADLY FULL

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:42.039 region:rollup2
OF EXAMPLES OF THE PERILS OF

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.774 region:rollup2
SILENCE.

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:45.576 region:rollup2
LESS THEN A DECADE AFTER THE

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:46.877 region:rollup2
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WHICH BY THE

00:50:45.576 --> 00:50:48.178 region:rollup2
WAY WAS REPORTED ABOUT AN

00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:49.880 region:rollup2
AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS IN THERE

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:51.582 region:rollup2
WERE EVEN FAMOUS AMERICAN

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.651 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO HELP VICTIMS OF THE

00:50:51.582 --> 00:50:56.287 region:rollup2
GENOCIDE.

00:50:53.651 --> 00:50:57.821 region:rollup2
SO LESS THAN A DECADE LATER.

00:50:56.287 --> 00:50:59.857 region:rollup2
HITLER DEVELOP HIS PLANS FOR THE

00:50:57.821 --> 00:51:01.725 region:rollup2
HOLOCAUST AND REASSURED HIS

00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:03.360 region:rollup2
COMMANDERS THAT THEY WOULD NOT

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:03.894 region:rollup2
FACE RETRIBUTION.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.996 region:rollup2
HE DECLARED WHO AFTER ALL

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:07.298 region:rollup2
SPEAKS.

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:10.134 region:rollup2
TODAY OF THE ANNIHILATION OF THE

00:51:07.298 --> 00:51:12.169 region:rollup2
ARMENIANS.

00:51:10.134 --> 00:51:14.138 region:rollup2
EVEN TODAY THOSE PERPETRATORS OF

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:16.173 region:rollup2
THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE.

00:51:14.138 --> 00:51:17.875 region:rollup2
WE'RE NEVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:19.610 region:rollup2
REPARATIONS WERE NEVER FULLY

00:51:17.875 --> 00:51:20.411 region:rollup2
MADE NEVER MADE IT ALL BY THE

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:23.147 region:rollup2
TURKISH GOVERNMENT TO THOSE

00:51:20.411 --> 00:51:24.748 region:rollup2
VICTIMS.

00:51:23.147 --> 00:51:26.350 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:27.351 region:rollup2
REMIND CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:28.619 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD WITH ANY GROUP IS

00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:30.287 region:rollup2
MARGINALIZED OR DISCRIMINATED

00:51:28.619 --> 00:51:32.323 region:rollup2

SPEAK UP TO PUSH BACK IN THE

00:51:32.323 --> 00:51:34.925 region:rollup2
FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY.

00:51:33.691 --> 00:51:38.963 region:rollup2
SO THAT NO ONE WILL KNOW THE

00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:39.797 region:rollup2
PAIN. THAT OUR ANCESTORS DID.

00:51:38.963 --> 00:51:41.365 region:rollup2
AND SPEAKING OUT DOES MAKE A

00:51:39.797 --> 00:51:42.800 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE

00:51:41.365 --> 00:51:44.902 region:rollup2
JUST YESTERDAY OVER FIFTY

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:47.137 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PEOPLE GATHER IN YOUR

00:51:44.902 --> 00:51:48.305 region:rollup2
VAN TO PROTEST.

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:50.641 region:rollup2
UNDEMOCRATIC ACTIONS BY THE

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:52.409 region:rollup2
ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT.

00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:53.611 region:rollup2
I'M VERY PROUD THAT IN MY CITY

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:54.678 region:rollup2

WITH THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTER

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:59.850 region:rollup2
IN ARMENIA.

00:51:58.816 --> 00:52:01.819 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WHAT. THOSE VOICES

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:03.354 region:rollup2
MATTERED.

00:52:01.819 --> 00:52:05.356 region:rollup2
JUST THIS MORNING THE GOVERNMENT

00:52:03.354 --> 00:52:07.191 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCED CHANGES.

00:52:05.356 --> 00:52:09.360 region:rollup2
THAT WILL MAKE ARMENIA.

00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:10.828 region:rollup2
THE DEMOCRACY THAT ITS PEOPLE

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.196 region:rollup2
WANTED TO BE AND THAT'S BECAUSE

00:52:10.828 --> 00:52:13.964 region:rollup2
OF THOSE BRAVE VOICES WHO STOOD

00:52:12.196 --> 00:52:14.999 region:rollup2
UP.

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:16.867 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR DUTY TO DO THE SAME

00:52:14.999 --> 00:52:18.602 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:19.837 region:rollup2
AND TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:21.572 region:rollup2
THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE IN CALLING

00:52:19.837 --> 00:52:23.440 region:rollup2
FOR WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION OF THE

00:52:21.572 --> 00:52:24.808 region:rollup2
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE.

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.110 region:rollup2
WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE DONE THIS

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:27.578 region:rollup2
YEAR AFTER YEAR AND YET THE

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:29.446 region:rollup2

00:52:41.225 --> 00:52:43.794 region:rollup2

00:52:42.326 --> 00:52:45.896 region:rollup2
GENOCIDE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT

COMMUNITY. AND THAT IS THE

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:04.915 region:rollup2

HUNDRED AND THIRD ANNIVERSARY.

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:51.261 region:rollup2
OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE.

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:52.696 region:rollup2
I APPLAUD THE EFFORTS OF

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:54.031 region:rollup2

OBLIGATION TO COMMEMORATE THE

ARMENIAN GENOCIDE BECAUSE I'M

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:10.760 region:rollup2
SIMPLY ETHNICALLY ARMENIAN.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:13.163 region:rollup2

HALF MILLION PEOPLE.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.085 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO CAPTURE WHAT THAT

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:36.386 region:rollup2
NUMBER REALLY MEANS.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.621 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO THE GENOCIDE THERE WERE

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:39.222 region:rollup2
TWO MILLION ARMENIANS LIVING IN

01:02:37.621 --> 01:02:40.824 region:rollup2

IT CAN NEVER BE CONQUERED.

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:13.162 region:rollup2

OF HUMAN KINDNESS.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:27.243 region:rollup2

THEMSELVES OUT THERE. AND RUN

FOR THAT COUNCIL BUT WILL DID

01:53:42.315 --> 01:53:46.353 region:rollup2
THAT I DON'T EVER FORGET THAT I

01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:48.055 region:rollup2
WAS ABLE TO MODERATE A FORUM IN

01:53:46.353 --> 01:53:49.122 region:rollup2
WHICH HE WAS A CANDIDATE AND HE

01:53:48.055 --> 01:53:50.557 region:rollup2
ALWAYS MODERATED FORUMS IN

01:53:49.122 --> 01:53:51.958 region:rollup2
GLENDALE FOR THE CITY COUNCIL

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:53.593 region:rollup2
CANDIDATES. WHEN I WAS A

01:53:51.958 --> 01:53:55.162 region:rollup2
CANDIDATE MYSELF MY VERY FIRST

01:53:53.593 --> 01:53:56.730 region:rollup2
CITY COUNCIL RACE HE WOULD ASK

01:53:55.162 --> 01:53:57.631 region:rollup2
THESE REALLY HARD QUESTIONS AT

01:53:56.730 --> 01:53:59.199 region:rollup2
OUR MEMBERS SITTING THERE

01:53:57.631 --> 01:54:00.801 region:rollup2
THINKING. IF THIS GUY ONLY KNEW

01:53:59.199 --> 01:54:01.835 region:rollup2
IT WAS REALLY LIKE TO BE A LOCAL

01:54:00.801 --> 01:54:03.003 region:rollup2
OFFICE HE WOULDN'T ASK THESE

01:54:01.835 --> 01:54:04.571 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST

01:54:03.003 --> 01:54:05.539 region:rollup2
RIDICULOUS QUESTIONS I CAN'T

01:54:04.571 --> 01:54:06.073 region:rollup2
TELL YOU. HOW ARE WE GOING TO

01:54:05.539 --> 01:54:08.108 region:rollup2
BALANCE THE BUDGET IN ONE

01:54:06.073 --> 01:54:09.242 region:rollup2
MINUTE?

01:54:08.108 --> 01:54:11.411 region:rollup2
SO WHEN I GOT TO MODERATE HIS

01:54:09.242 --> 01:54:13.146 region:rollup2
FORM I REALLY HAD FUN ASKING HIM

01:54:11.411 --> 01:54:14.114 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE SAME HARD QUESTIONS.

01:54:13.146 --> 01:54:15.816 region:rollup2
AND AFTERWARDS HE WALKED UP TO

01:54:14.114 --> 01:54:17.150 region:rollup2
ME AND HE SAID.

01:54:15.816 --> 01:54:18.218 region:rollup2
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT EVER

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:19.419 region:rollup2
SINCE I'VE BEEN RUNNING I'VE

01:54:18.218 --> 01:54:20.821 region:rollup2
BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHEN I USED

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:23.056 region:rollup2
TO MODERATE THOSE FORMS AND HOW

01:54:20.821 --> 01:54:24.758 region:rollup2
UNFAIR THOSE QUESTIONS WERE NOW

01:54:23.056 --> 01:54:26.326 region:rollup2
THAT I'M DOING IT MYSELF. AND I

01:54:24.758 --> 01:54:27.728 region:rollup2
REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU

01:54:26.326 --> 01:54:28.662 region:rollup2
CANDIDATES GO THROUGH AND IF I

01:54:27.728 --> 01:54:30.263 region:rollup2
WAS GOING TO GO BACK AND DO

01:54:28.662 --> 01:54:31.398 region:rollup2
JOURNALISM AGAIN I DO A LITTLE

01:54:30.263 --> 01:54:32.999 region:rollup2
BIT DIFFERENTLY AND HOW I

01:54:31.398 --> 01:54:34.434 region:rollup2
COVERED THE CITY COUNCIL ON THE

01:54:32.999 --> 01:54:36.670 region:rollup2
CANDIDATES. IT WAS REALLY

01:54:34.434 --> 01:54:38.205 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL THAT HE WAS ABLE TO

01:54:36.670 --> 01:54:39.673 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT JOURNEY IN HIS CAREER

01:54:38.205 --> 01:54:41.174 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNOW HE HAD ALWAYS

01:54:39.673 --> 01:54:42.576 region:rollup2
WANTED TO DO THAT. SO IT WAS

01:54:41.174 --> 01:54:43.944 region:rollup2
SUCH A JOY WHEN HE WON HIS CITY

01:54:42.576 --> 01:54:45.479 region:rollup2
COUNCIL RACE AND BECAME THE

01:54:43.944 --> 01:54:47.013 region:rollup2

01:54:45.479 --> 01:54:47.881 region:rollup2

ME.

01:54:49.416 --> 01:54:53.053 region:rollup2
THE CRAP PASSING OF WILL REALLY
